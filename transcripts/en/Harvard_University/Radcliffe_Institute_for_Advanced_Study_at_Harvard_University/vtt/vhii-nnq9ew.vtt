00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.994
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:05.990 --> 00:00:07.930
- Welcome, friends
and colleagues,

00:00:07.930 --> 00:00:11.560
to Radcliffe Day 2017.

00:00:11.560 --> 00:00:14.230
As many of you know, if you
were across the street with us,

00:00:14.230 --> 00:00:15.110
I'm Liz Cohen.

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:16.750
I'm Dean of the
Radcliffe Institute

00:00:16.750 --> 00:00:18.730
for Advanced Study at Harvard.

00:00:18.730 --> 00:00:22.150
And it is a pleasure to
have you all here with us

00:00:22.150 --> 00:00:25.060
under this big tent.

00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:31.900
Years ago, the size of
this tent was aspirational.

00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:37.090
We imagined that one day, it
would be absolutely filled

00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:41.290
with Radcliffe and Harvard
graduates, institute fellows,

00:00:41.290 --> 00:00:44.290
university friends,
and participants

00:00:44.290 --> 00:00:46.510
in our many programs.

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:50.140
Today, we don't
have to imagine it.

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:52.780
Attendance here
at Radcliffe Yard

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:55.750
has doubled in just
the past five years.

00:00:55.750 --> 00:01:03.010
And we are joined by a global
online audience as well.

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:06.640
I am especially pleased
to welcome Drew Gilpin

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:09.820
Faust, Harvard President and
Founding Dean of the Radcliffe

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:10.320
Institute;

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:12.137
[APPLAUSE]

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:21.040
Provost Alan Garber; numerous
deans and other university

00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:23.950
leaders; and Bill Lee,
Senior Fellow of the Harvard

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:28.350
Corporation; along
with many other members

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:30.970
of Harvard's governing boards.

00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:34.030
A warm welcome to the
Harvard Alumni Association,

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:37.150
the Radcliffe Dean's Advisory
Council, the Schlesinger

00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:41.080
Library Council, the Radcliffe
Associates Program, the Anne

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:44.890
Radcliffe's Society, as well as
past members of the Radcliffe

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:49.730
College, Board of Trustees,
and Alumni Association.

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:52.330
And we are thrilled to
have the honorable Maura

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:54.820
Healy joining us as well.

00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:56.740
[APPLAUSE, CHEERING]

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:03.590
Just in case you
didn't know, she

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:06.860
is the attorney general of the
Commonwealth of Massachusetts,

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:13.340
a member of the class of
1992, and Chief Marshall

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:16.580
of yesterday's
commencement ceremonies.

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:21.740
And of course, a special welcome
to Radcliffe medalist Judy

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:23.780
Woodruff, our
afternoon speakers--

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:25.580
[APPLAUSE]

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:35.270
--our afternoon speakers, Walter
Isaacson and Michele Norris,

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:37.940
and all of the participants
in this morning's

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:40.560
excellent discussion.

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:43.350
I am also delighted
to welcome back

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:46.590
everyone who is here to
attend college reunion,

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:54.180
including the reunion classes
of 1942 and '47, '52 and '57,

00:02:54.180 --> 00:03:07.950
'62 and '67, '72 and
'77, '82 and '87, '92

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:21.300
and '97, 2002, 2007, 2012, and
we have some newest graduates

00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:23.096
in the class of 2017.

00:03:23.096 --> 00:03:25.825
[APPLAUSE]

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:33.600
In addition, we welcome Bunting
fellows, Radcliffe fellows,

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:35.910
and our Radcliffe
research partners

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:39.030
who are undergraduates who
work closely with our fellows

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:40.500
on their research.

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:43.980
Please join me in congratulating
the members of the earliest

00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:48.430
class represented here today,
the great class of 1941.

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:51.270
[APPLAUSE]

00:03:57.920 --> 00:04:01.230
When so many of us
are gathered together,

00:04:01.230 --> 00:04:04.530
our thoughts turn to members
of our Radcliffe community

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:06.900
who are no longer with us.

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:09.390
This year, we
experienced the loss

00:04:09.390 --> 00:04:13.140
of Mary Maples Dunn who
directed the Schlesinger Library

00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:16.190
and then led Radcliffe
as interim head

00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:19.529
while Radcliffe College made
the transition to the Radcliffe

00:04:19.529 --> 00:04:22.140
Institute for Advanced Study.

00:04:22.140 --> 00:04:24.540
We also lost Susan
Story Lyman who

00:04:24.540 --> 00:04:27.090
served as chair of
the board of trustees,

00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:29.970
among many other roles
in her decades of service

00:04:29.970 --> 00:04:31.620
to Radcliffe College.

00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:33.960
For them and for
the many others who

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:36.970
are missed and in
our thoughts today,

00:04:36.970 --> 00:04:39.120
please join me in a
moment of silence.

00:04:49.730 --> 00:04:52.760
The Radcliffe Institute
is devoted to the pursuit

00:04:52.760 --> 00:04:55.010
of new knowledge
wherever it may be

00:04:55.010 --> 00:04:59.430
found by whomever is seeking
it, whether fellows, students,

00:04:59.430 --> 00:05:02.420
faculty, or public audiences.

00:05:02.420 --> 00:05:05.570
That new idea might
lie in medieval history

00:05:05.570 --> 00:05:08.510
or in the observation
of a black hole.

00:05:08.510 --> 00:05:11.810
It might be found in the pages
of a diary at the Schlesinger

00:05:11.810 --> 00:05:16.130
Library or on the walls of the
Johnson-Kulukundis Family Art

00:05:16.130 --> 00:05:17.510
Gallery.

00:05:17.510 --> 00:05:20.750
We believe, as an institute
for advanced study,

00:05:20.750 --> 00:05:25.610
that it is our responsibility
to be both timely and timeless

00:05:25.610 --> 00:05:29.030
and that our support
of inquiry is even more

00:05:29.030 --> 00:05:32.920
necessary in tumultuous times.

00:05:32.920 --> 00:05:36.070
You can see this conviction
in Radcliffe's offerings

00:05:36.070 --> 00:05:39.220
this past year, from
our current exhibition

00:05:39.220 --> 00:05:42.490
about the history of
Title IX to our science

00:05:42.490 --> 00:05:46.120
symposium on the impact of
climate change on the world's

00:05:46.120 --> 00:05:51.550
oceans to our conference on
universities and slavery.

00:05:51.550 --> 00:05:55.270
In the year ahead, we will
launch a major programming

00:05:55.270 --> 00:05:59.260
initiative on citizenship,
celebrate the Schlesinger

00:05:59.260 --> 00:06:04.450
Library's 75th anniversary, and
welcome a fellowship class that

00:06:04.450 --> 00:06:08.770
includes a former UN ambassador,
a Turing Award-winning

00:06:08.770 --> 00:06:12.940
scientist, and a Pulitzer
Prize-winning novelist.

00:06:12.940 --> 00:06:14.950
I hope that many
of you will join us

00:06:14.950 --> 00:06:18.490
next fall for an exciting
calendar of events.

00:06:18.490 --> 00:06:20.800
In just the first
few months, we will

00:06:20.800 --> 00:06:25.840
mount a panel on the present and
future of Boston's art museums,

00:06:25.840 --> 00:06:28.930
a lecture by physicist
Brian Greene,

00:06:28.930 --> 00:06:34.100
a day-long science symposium on
epidemics, and much, much more.

00:06:34.100 --> 00:06:37.280
You can get details
at our website.

00:06:37.280 --> 00:06:40.550
Radcliffe is a very
busy, dynamic place

00:06:40.550 --> 00:06:44.240
where all that we do is
made possible by support

00:06:44.240 --> 00:06:46.880
from so many of you here today.

00:06:46.880 --> 00:06:50.390
In fact, we have
set a new record.

00:06:50.390 --> 00:06:55.550
I am thrilled to announce that
the Radcliffe campaign has just

00:06:55.550 --> 00:06:58.520
surpassed its $70 million goal.

00:06:58.520 --> 00:07:00.488
[APPLAUSE]

00:07:05.420 --> 00:07:09.500
We have already received
over 20,000 gifts,

00:07:09.500 --> 00:07:12.800
attracted more than
1,000 first-time donors,

00:07:12.800 --> 00:07:15.620
and diversified
our support base.

00:07:15.620 --> 00:07:18.590
And fortunately, we
still have a year

00:07:18.590 --> 00:07:21.710
to go before the campaign ends.

00:07:21.710 --> 00:07:24.620
Please join me in
expressing appreciation

00:07:24.620 --> 00:07:27.140
to members of our
Dean's Advisory Council

00:07:27.140 --> 00:07:31.160
and Schlesinger Library Council
and to Sid Knafel and Susan

00:07:31.160 --> 00:07:34.831
Wallach for their extraordinary
leadership as campaign

00:07:34.831 --> 00:07:35.330
co-chairs.

00:07:35.330 --> 00:07:37.400
[APPLAUSE]

00:07:37.400 --> 00:07:39.170
Will those members please stand?

00:07:39.170 --> 00:07:41.545
[APPLAUSE]

00:07:44.880 --> 00:07:48.240
We're asking our council
members please to stand.

00:07:48.240 --> 00:07:50.720
[APPLAUSE]

00:07:56.190 --> 00:08:00.940
I cannot possibly cover here
every accomplishment made

00:08:00.940 --> 00:08:02.125
possible by the campaign.

00:08:02.125 --> 00:08:05.160
But I'll just share
a few highlights.

00:08:05.160 --> 00:08:08.640
We have built up a robust
public programming wing

00:08:08.640 --> 00:08:10.860
of the institute-- you
experienced some of that this

00:08:10.860 --> 00:08:11.610
morning--

00:08:11.610 --> 00:08:15.660
what we call Academic
Ventures, as our wing

00:08:15.660 --> 00:08:18.750
to complement the Schlesinger
Library and the fellowship

00:08:18.750 --> 00:08:23.280
program as the three pillars
of the Radcliffe Institute.

00:08:23.280 --> 00:08:25.170
We have expanded
the Schlesinger's

00:08:25.170 --> 00:08:28.200
undergraduate
teaching activities.

00:08:28.200 --> 00:08:31.350
We have established
directorships, fellowships,

00:08:31.350 --> 00:08:33.210
and professorships.

00:08:33.210 --> 00:08:37.350
We have launched a major
campus renewal project.

00:08:37.350 --> 00:08:40.230
We have initiated a
university-wide student

00:08:40.230 --> 00:08:44.190
public art competition
and created flexible funds

00:08:44.190 --> 00:08:49.110
for the sciences, the arts,
the library, and much more.

00:08:49.110 --> 00:08:53.070
I am absolutely delighted
with our progress,

00:08:53.070 --> 00:08:55.870
but we are not done yet.

00:08:55.870 --> 00:09:00.180
The campaign concludes
in June of 2018.

00:09:00.180 --> 00:09:03.960
And we will continue to
pursue our aspirations

00:09:03.960 --> 00:09:06.300
as Harvard's Institute
for Advanced Study

00:09:06.300 --> 00:09:09.750
and to increase our
impact in the world.

00:09:09.750 --> 00:09:12.330
Going forward, we will
focus our energies

00:09:12.330 --> 00:09:16.470
on raising funds for
unmet campaign priorities.

00:09:16.470 --> 00:09:20.700
We aim to fully endow the
fellowship program to provide

00:09:20.700 --> 00:09:24.510
our 50 talented fellows
a year with the highest

00:09:24.510 --> 00:09:27.210
quality of
experience, regardless

00:09:27.210 --> 00:09:29.610
of their personal resources.

00:09:29.610 --> 00:09:32.820
We intend to diversify
the Schlesinger Library's

00:09:32.820 --> 00:09:35.520
collections to
broaden and deepen

00:09:35.520 --> 00:09:39.180
the history of American women
that library researchers are

00:09:39.180 --> 00:09:42.360
able to write
today and tomorrow.

00:09:42.360 --> 00:09:45.570
We will grow the Exploratory
and Advanced Seminars

00:09:45.570 --> 00:09:48.540
program run by academic
ventures to meet

00:09:48.540 --> 00:09:52.620
increasing demand from Harvard
faculty and Radcliffe fellows

00:09:52.620 --> 00:09:55.530
who wish to pursue
collaborative research

00:09:55.530 --> 00:09:59.880
and explore even more deeply
in their areas of expertise.

00:09:59.880 --> 00:10:03.210
And we plan to renovate
Radcliffe's buildings

00:10:03.210 --> 00:10:05.970
to provide state of
the art facilities

00:10:05.970 --> 00:10:08.490
to make possible
the highest level

00:10:08.490 --> 00:10:12.720
of scholarly and artistic
work and public events.

00:10:12.720 --> 00:10:16.650
It is fitting that today,
Radcliffe Day 2017,

00:10:16.650 --> 00:10:19.560
we are celebrating
this campaign success

00:10:19.560 --> 00:10:23.470
and our continued
ambitions with all of you.

00:10:23.470 --> 00:10:26.550
Thank you for helping us
to reach this milestone

00:10:26.550 --> 00:10:29.610
and for your continued
enthusiasm for the Radcliffe

00:10:29.610 --> 00:10:30.190
Institute.

00:10:30.190 --> 00:10:32.640
[APPLAUSE]

00:10:38.030 --> 00:10:42.260
The Radcliffe Campaign has
reached one kind of milestone.

00:10:42.260 --> 00:10:46.100
But our society has been
living through a pivotal time

00:10:46.100 --> 00:10:48.260
of a different sort.

00:10:48.260 --> 00:10:51.320
In recent years,
the American media

00:10:51.320 --> 00:10:53.570
has undergone dramatic shifts.

00:10:53.570 --> 00:10:57.200
And all of us here have
experienced some elements

00:10:57.200 --> 00:10:59.360
of that transition.

00:10:59.360 --> 00:11:04.020
To get our news, we used
to snap open a newspaper

00:11:04.020 --> 00:11:06.240
or tune the radio dial.

00:11:06.240 --> 00:11:09.000
Now we might turn
on a television

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:13.650
or, increasingly, swipe
a screen for a headline.

00:11:13.650 --> 00:11:16.590
Unlike some evolutions,
in this case,

00:11:16.590 --> 00:11:19.320
the new hasn't eclipsed the old.

00:11:19.320 --> 00:11:23.700
These various forms of
media co-exist together.

00:11:23.700 --> 00:11:26.520
With all the
options, it turns out

00:11:26.520 --> 00:11:29.220
that Americans,
on a weekly basis,

00:11:29.220 --> 00:11:33.570
now follow the news most
on television, followed

00:11:33.570 --> 00:11:37.050
by their computers and
other electronic devices,

00:11:37.050 --> 00:11:41.520
then radio, and then
finally, print publications.

00:11:41.520 --> 00:11:44.280
I was going to express
condolences to the print

00:11:44.280 --> 00:11:45.280
journalists in the room.

00:11:45.280 --> 00:11:48.660
But after hearing Jonah remind
us that it all comes down

00:11:48.660 --> 00:11:51.520
to print, I feel better.

00:11:51.520 --> 00:11:54.870
In other words,
television is number one

00:11:54.870 --> 00:11:59.310
when it comes to shaping what
we know, when we know it,

00:11:59.310 --> 00:12:02.010
and whom we trust.

00:12:02.010 --> 00:12:05.160
It is especially
important in this context

00:12:05.160 --> 00:12:08.850
to recognize that it
was only four years ago

00:12:08.850 --> 00:12:13.350
that the United States gained
its first all-female TV news

00:12:13.350 --> 00:12:18.210
team when Gwen Ifill and Judy
Woodruff were named co-anchors

00:12:18.210 --> 00:12:19.950
of the PBS News Hour.

00:12:19.950 --> 00:12:22.440
[APPLAUSE]

00:12:27.420 --> 00:12:30.760
In covering the news,
they made the news.

00:12:30.760 --> 00:12:33.070
Judy and Gwen weren't
just a stellar team

00:12:33.070 --> 00:12:36.340
of journalists with decades
of combined experience

00:12:36.340 --> 00:12:38.740
on camera and in print.

00:12:38.740 --> 00:12:43.420
They became part of the
history of American journalism.

00:12:43.420 --> 00:12:46.120
The importance of an
all-women news team

00:12:46.120 --> 00:12:50.230
is perhaps best summed
up in Gwen's own words.

00:12:50.230 --> 00:12:54.760
She said, and I quote her, "When
I was a little girl watching

00:12:54.760 --> 00:12:58.630
programs like this, because
that's the kind of nerdy family

00:12:58.630 --> 00:13:02.590
we were, I would look
up and not see anyone

00:13:02.590 --> 00:13:05.290
who looked like me in any way--

00:13:05.290 --> 00:13:08.200
no women, no people of color.

00:13:08.200 --> 00:13:11.920
I'm very keen about the fact
that a little girl now watching

00:13:11.920 --> 00:13:16.690
the news, when they see me
and Judy sitting side by side,

00:13:16.690 --> 00:13:20.110
it will occur to them that
that's perfectly normal--

00:13:20.110 --> 00:13:24.570
that it won't seem like any
big breakthrough at all."

00:13:24.570 --> 00:13:27.390
Well, maybe someday, a
team like Judy and Gwen

00:13:27.390 --> 00:13:29.880
won't seem like a major change.

00:13:29.880 --> 00:13:32.970
But we who have been
watching the news longer

00:13:32.970 --> 00:13:35.160
know that we actually
have witnessed

00:13:35.160 --> 00:13:36.780
two big breakthroughs--

00:13:36.780 --> 00:13:39.190
Judy's and Gwen's.

00:13:39.190 --> 00:13:42.280
Neither had an easy
start in journalism.

00:13:42.280 --> 00:13:45.820
They experienced
resistance and rejection.

00:13:45.820 --> 00:13:49.000
Like a certain current
Massachusetts senator,

00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:50.290
they were warned.

00:13:50.290 --> 00:13:52.390
They were given explanations.

00:13:52.390 --> 00:13:54.310
Nevertheless, they persisted.

00:13:54.310 --> 00:13:56.230
[APPLAUSE]

00:14:01.040 --> 00:14:05.390
Judy is a proud graduate of
Duke where she was active,

00:14:05.390 --> 00:14:08.180
not surprisingly, in
publications, the student

00:14:08.180 --> 00:14:10.610
union, and student government.

00:14:10.610 --> 00:14:12.800
She followed her
interest in politics

00:14:12.800 --> 00:14:17.000
to an internship in Washington
where her enthusiasm

00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:19.160
collided with
warnings against women

00:14:19.160 --> 00:14:21.770
pursuing political careers.

00:14:21.770 --> 00:14:25.820
So she decided instead
to cover politics

00:14:25.820 --> 00:14:29.060
and applied for jobs at
local television stations

00:14:29.060 --> 00:14:31.520
back home in Atlanta.

00:14:31.520 --> 00:14:34.310
One station turned
her down because,

00:14:34.310 --> 00:14:38.390
and I quote, "we already
have a woman reporter."

00:14:38.390 --> 00:14:41.000
She could, however,
be a secretary.

00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:43.670
Judy remained undeterred.

00:14:43.670 --> 00:14:45.560
She worked her way
up by reporting

00:14:45.560 --> 00:14:47.900
on stories across
Georgia, including

00:14:47.900 --> 00:14:51.050
covering Jimmy Carter's
presidential campaign.

00:14:51.050 --> 00:14:53.720
She served as a White
House correspondent,

00:14:53.720 --> 00:14:57.140
the anchor of a PBS
documentary series,

00:14:57.140 --> 00:15:00.390
and a senior
correspondent at CNN.

00:15:00.390 --> 00:15:04.280
Longtime News Hour colleague
Jim Lehrer offered an insight

00:15:04.280 --> 00:15:07.220
into Judy's success
when he said, "No matter

00:15:07.220 --> 00:15:10.130
how hard everyone
else was working,

00:15:10.130 --> 00:15:12.860
Judy was working harder."

00:15:12.860 --> 00:15:15.800
Her young colleagues
today still agree.

00:15:15.800 --> 00:15:18.110
In a recent New
York Times profile,

00:15:18.110 --> 00:15:22.160
a 27-year-old politics
producer said about Judy,

00:15:22.160 --> 00:15:25.160
"We all struggle just
to keep up with her.

00:15:25.160 --> 00:15:28.190
She's just such a workhorse."

00:15:28.190 --> 00:15:30.650
And she has worked everywhere.

00:15:30.650 --> 00:15:32.900
We saw her reporting
in Washington

00:15:32.900 --> 00:15:36.560
just after the assassination
attempt on President Reagan,

00:15:36.560 --> 00:15:40.250
from outside the Murrah Federal
building in Oklahoma City,

00:15:40.250 --> 00:15:44.000
on the ground in Chechnya,
and in Chicago on the night

00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:46.910
President Obama
was first elected.

00:15:46.910 --> 00:15:51.110
Wherever she is, Judy
delivers first-rate reporting

00:15:51.110 --> 00:15:54.140
and smart, incisive interviews.

00:15:54.140 --> 00:15:56.570
Because she asks
better questions,

00:15:56.570 --> 00:15:59.360
she gets better answers.

00:15:59.360 --> 00:16:02.510
When Susan Rice, President
Obama's White House National

00:16:02.510 --> 00:16:04.700
Security Adviser,
was ready to give

00:16:04.700 --> 00:16:07.280
her first interview
after leaving office,

00:16:07.280 --> 00:16:09.290
it was with Judy.

00:16:09.290 --> 00:16:12.950
When Vice President Mike Pence
gave his first television

00:16:12.950 --> 00:16:17.330
interview after taking
office, it was with Judy.

00:16:17.330 --> 00:16:20.630
Now there may not be much
else that Mike Pence and Susan

00:16:20.630 --> 00:16:22.010
Rice agree on.

00:16:22.010 --> 00:16:24.770
But they both
trust Judy Woodruff

00:16:24.770 --> 00:16:28.930
to communicate their views
to the American public.

00:16:28.930 --> 00:16:32.560
Judy has also won the trust
of the many journalists whose

00:16:32.560 --> 00:16:37.240
careers she has helped launch
and support as founding

00:16:37.240 --> 00:16:41.140
co-chair of the International
Women's Media Foundation.

00:16:41.140 --> 00:16:44.350
The reason why so many
professionals admire Judy

00:16:44.350 --> 00:16:47.470
is the same reason
viewers do and why

00:16:47.470 --> 00:16:49.540
we are honoring her today.

00:16:49.540 --> 00:16:55.600
We respect her intelligence,
and we rely on her integrity.

00:16:55.600 --> 00:16:59.840
Gwen's career, like Judy's,
began with some bumps.

00:16:59.840 --> 00:17:02.410
Gwen was interning
at the Boston Herald

00:17:02.410 --> 00:17:04.300
at the height of
the Boston busing

00:17:04.300 --> 00:17:09.339
crisis of the 1970s when she
found a threatening racist note

00:17:09.339 --> 00:17:10.990
on her desk.

00:17:10.990 --> 00:17:13.690
Given that climate,
it is no surprise

00:17:13.690 --> 00:17:16.750
that she was initially
reluctant to accept the job

00:17:16.750 --> 00:17:19.450
offer from the Herald
upon her graduation

00:17:19.450 --> 00:17:22.390
from Simmons College
a year later.

00:17:22.390 --> 00:17:24.310
But she did need a job.

00:17:24.310 --> 00:17:27.460
So she returned to
the Herald after all.

00:17:27.460 --> 00:17:31.040
Years later, she said about
that decision, and I quote,

00:17:31.040 --> 00:17:35.440
"I knew if I got my foot in
the door, I could do it."

00:17:35.440 --> 00:17:40.210
And Gwen did far more than
get her foot in the door.

00:17:40.210 --> 00:17:43.510
She went on to report for the
Baltimore Sun, The Washington

00:17:43.510 --> 00:17:46.720
Post, and The New York Times,
as a White House correspondent,

00:17:46.720 --> 00:17:49.150
and then to NBC television.

00:17:49.150 --> 00:17:51.970
Even as the news cycle
sped up, Gwen never

00:17:51.970 --> 00:17:55.270
stopped being respected
as an impeccable writer,

00:17:55.270 --> 00:17:58.930
a sharp analyst, and
a caring colleague.

00:17:58.930 --> 00:18:03.460
When Gwen became the moderator
of the PBS program Washington

00:18:03.460 --> 00:18:09.520
Week in Review in 1999, she also
became the first black woman

00:18:09.520 --> 00:18:13.660
to host a national political
talk show on television.

00:18:13.660 --> 00:18:16.330
Along with her
professional expertise,

00:18:16.330 --> 00:18:20.140
she brought her dinner table
experiences, growing up as one

00:18:20.140 --> 00:18:23.380
of six children in a family
where every evening's

00:18:23.380 --> 00:18:26.920
conversation drew on
knowledge of current events

00:18:26.920 --> 00:18:29.770
and honed sharp
critical thinking.

00:18:29.770 --> 00:18:32.140
Holding her own
among her siblings

00:18:32.140 --> 00:18:34.720
trained her to
set high standards

00:18:34.720 --> 00:18:37.720
for the level of discourse
and to manage her guests

00:18:37.720 --> 00:18:39.100
masterfully.

00:18:39.100 --> 00:18:42.580
With Gwen running the show,
there were disagreements,

00:18:42.580 --> 00:18:46.600
but tough exchanges
were not disagreeable.

00:18:46.600 --> 00:18:48.970
Over the decades,
millions of Americans

00:18:48.970 --> 00:18:51.940
came to rely on the
information Gwen provided

00:18:51.940 --> 00:18:53.920
and the discussions she led.

00:18:53.920 --> 00:18:57.430
That trust was born from one
of Gwen's cardinal rules,

00:18:57.430 --> 00:18:59.200
no predictions.

00:18:59.200 --> 00:19:01.540
Guests on Washington
Week who trafficked

00:19:01.540 --> 00:19:06.280
in theories or speculation
were not invited back.

00:19:06.280 --> 00:19:11.590
She kept her focus and ours on
what was known, how we knew it,

00:19:11.590 --> 00:19:13.970
and why it mattered.

00:19:13.970 --> 00:19:17.690
When we think about Gwen
and Judy as individuals,

00:19:17.690 --> 00:19:22.610
we find insight, persistence,
achievement, and personal

00:19:22.610 --> 00:19:24.890
and professional integrity.

00:19:24.890 --> 00:19:27.500
Both were recognized
for those qualities

00:19:27.500 --> 00:19:30.110
when assigned to moderate
presidential and vice

00:19:30.110 --> 00:19:33.680
presidential debates,
interview world leaders,

00:19:33.680 --> 00:19:37.970
and report on the most
important stories of the day.

00:19:37.970 --> 00:19:40.280
But what we saw when
they came together

00:19:40.280 --> 00:19:45.680
as co-anchors of PBS News Hour
was capability and chemistry

00:19:45.680 --> 00:19:47.930
at the highest levels.

00:19:47.930 --> 00:19:50.960
And the connection that
Gwen and Judy shared

00:19:50.960 --> 00:19:55.040
extended to the entire News
Hour family of correspondents

00:19:55.040 --> 00:19:59.750
and commentators, so much so
that we, as audience members,

00:19:59.750 --> 00:20:02.610
felt a part of it as well.

00:20:02.610 --> 00:20:04.760
We are pleased to
be joined here today

00:20:04.760 --> 00:20:07.550
by some of the many
journalists that Gwen and Judy

00:20:07.550 --> 00:20:11.900
have inspired and championed
over the years as mentors

00:20:11.900 --> 00:20:17.040
and colleagues, as well as
with their friends and family.

00:20:17.040 --> 00:20:20.580
It is hard to imagine anyone
better-suited to converse

00:20:20.580 --> 00:20:23.410
with Judy than Walter Isaacson.

00:20:23.410 --> 00:20:26.910
His omnivorous intellect has
led to an impressive journalism

00:20:26.910 --> 00:20:29.970
career, leadership of
the Aspen Institute,

00:20:29.970 --> 00:20:33.180
and the award-winning
biographies of leading figures

00:20:33.180 --> 00:20:36.130
from the 18th through
the 21st centuries,

00:20:36.130 --> 00:20:39.570
including Benjamin
Franklin, Albert Einstein,

00:20:39.570 --> 00:20:41.190
and Steve Jobs.

00:20:41.190 --> 00:20:45.360
Who better to help us examine
the state of journalism

00:20:45.360 --> 00:20:46.650
at present?

00:20:46.650 --> 00:20:51.570
Who better to shed light on the
contributions of our honorees?

00:20:51.570 --> 00:20:53.850
And who better, if
it's not too much

00:20:53.850 --> 00:20:57.630
to ask, Walter, to give us
some hope for the future?

00:20:57.630 --> 00:21:01.004
Please join me in welcoming
Walter Isaacson and Judy

00:21:01.004 --> 00:21:01.920
Woodruff to the stage.

00:21:01.920 --> 00:21:04.186
[APPLAUSE]

00:21:14.665 --> 00:21:16.670
- Thank you.

00:21:16.670 --> 00:21:17.830
- Thank you, Dean.

00:21:17.830 --> 00:21:20.470
Thank you, Liz.

00:21:20.470 --> 00:21:22.090
Congratulations, Judy.

00:21:22.090 --> 00:21:25.750
This is a huge honor, and I
cannot think of anybody who

00:21:25.750 --> 00:21:29.360
deserves this honor, or to
share with the memory of Gwen,

00:21:29.360 --> 00:21:29.860
than you.

00:21:29.860 --> 00:21:30.651
So congratulations.

00:21:30.651 --> 00:21:31.540
- Thank you.

00:21:31.540 --> 00:21:32.380
I am humble.

00:21:32.380 --> 00:21:32.880
Thank you.

00:21:32.880 --> 00:21:36.570
[APPLAUSE]

00:21:36.570 --> 00:21:38.550
- Our panel this
morning spent a lot

00:21:38.550 --> 00:21:41.610
of time talking about truth--

00:21:41.610 --> 00:21:45.060
in a place where
Veritas is revered,

00:21:45.060 --> 00:21:49.440
how we've lost that as the
true north of all journalism

00:21:49.440 --> 00:21:51.630
in our political discourse.

00:21:51.630 --> 00:21:56.330
One of the things that you
and Gwen shared so much

00:21:56.330 --> 00:21:58.620
was an intellectual honesty.

00:21:58.620 --> 00:22:02.610
And there are very few people
we could look at and say,

00:22:02.610 --> 00:22:05.970
if they are saying it,
they believe it to be true.

00:22:05.970 --> 00:22:08.430
Tell us about the
quality in Gwen

00:22:08.430 --> 00:22:10.980
and how that helped
shape your journalism.

00:22:10.980 --> 00:22:15.180
- Well, first of all, I'm just
incredibly honored to be here.

00:22:15.180 --> 00:22:17.370
This is just a moment.

00:22:17.370 --> 00:22:22.110
I know Gwen is looking down
on all of us right now,

00:22:22.110 --> 00:22:24.900
so sorry that she can't
be here, but thrilled

00:22:24.900 --> 00:22:28.290
that she is represented
by her amazing mentees

00:22:28.290 --> 00:22:30.990
and her close friends, who we're
going to hear from a little bit

00:22:30.990 --> 00:22:31.350
later.

00:22:31.350 --> 00:22:32.850
And Walter, you
knew Gwen very well.

00:22:32.850 --> 00:22:37.840
So you know, as I do, she
really wanted to be here today.

00:22:37.840 --> 00:22:40.730
So I think of her as
sitting right next to me.

00:22:40.730 --> 00:22:43.190
- She's certainly smiling
with that amazing smile

00:22:43.190 --> 00:22:44.010
down upon us.

00:22:44.010 --> 00:22:46.430
- She is.

00:22:46.430 --> 00:22:50.460
How to begin about Gwen
is, she represented--

00:22:50.460 --> 00:22:53.430
you all know what an
incredible journalist she was.

00:22:53.430 --> 00:22:55.830
The thing was, when we came
together at the News Hour,

00:22:55.830 --> 00:22:57.510
she had been there since 1999.

00:22:57.510 --> 00:23:00.990
I came back to the
News Hour in 2007.

00:23:00.990 --> 00:23:02.070
And we knew each other.

00:23:02.070 --> 00:23:03.180
We were friendly.

00:23:03.180 --> 00:23:04.690
But we hadn't been colleagues.

00:23:04.690 --> 00:23:07.920
And I was thinking about
this a lot last night.

00:23:07.920 --> 00:23:10.232
We probably regarded each
other a little carefully

00:23:10.232 --> 00:23:10.940
in the beginning.

00:23:10.940 --> 00:23:12.150
We're both competitive.

00:23:12.150 --> 00:23:13.620
We both had been doing.

00:23:13.620 --> 00:23:16.740
We've had heads down
for years and years.

00:23:16.740 --> 00:23:19.930
And so it took a few months--

00:23:19.930 --> 00:23:22.470
maybe a year or so-- for
us to be really comfortable

00:23:22.470 --> 00:23:24.600
with each other in the newsroom.

00:23:24.600 --> 00:23:27.520
But once we got to
know each other--

00:23:27.520 --> 00:23:30.632
once we knew that we both
believed in the same things--

00:23:30.632 --> 00:23:32.340
and Walter, this comes
to your question--

00:23:32.340 --> 00:23:35.490
and once I saw up
close all the things

00:23:35.490 --> 00:23:39.300
that I had heard about
Gwen, knew about Gwen,

00:23:39.300 --> 00:23:41.880
I recognized that I was in
the presence of somebody who

00:23:41.880 --> 00:23:46.410
was emblematic of the kind of
journalism that I believe in,

00:23:46.410 --> 00:23:49.080
that should be the
journalism that persists.

00:23:49.080 --> 00:23:54.180
She was absolutely relentless
in pursuit of facts.

00:23:54.180 --> 00:23:58.170
She was bold in the way
she approached people,

00:23:58.170 --> 00:24:00.780
fearless in the way she talked
about the kind of stories

00:24:00.780 --> 00:24:02.040
we were going to do.

00:24:02.040 --> 00:24:03.840
I'll just tell you,
in a morning meeting,

00:24:03.840 --> 00:24:06.540
we're discussing what to put
on the News Hour that night.

00:24:06.540 --> 00:24:09.561
We might go around the table
and everybody would chime in,

00:24:09.561 --> 00:24:11.310
this is a great idea,
that's a great idea.

00:24:11.310 --> 00:24:13.101
And Gwen would be the
one to say, you know,

00:24:13.101 --> 00:24:17.890
that's really a terrible
idea, and here's why.

00:24:17.890 --> 00:24:19.950
And she would go
on and explain it.

00:24:19.950 --> 00:24:22.170
And so it was that
quality of Gwen--

00:24:22.170 --> 00:24:25.530
it was getting right to
the heart of the matter.

00:24:25.530 --> 00:24:29.010
And it was always thinking of
everybody else in the room.

00:24:29.010 --> 00:24:32.880
She was always the one who was
looking to the younger staff,

00:24:32.880 --> 00:24:38.130
to the desk assistant who
had just come on our team

00:24:38.130 --> 00:24:40.890
and was there and was
quiet and holding back.

00:24:40.890 --> 00:24:44.640
Gwen would be the first one to
know that young man or young

00:24:44.640 --> 00:24:49.470
woman's name, to pull them
out, and to recognize that her

00:24:49.470 --> 00:24:51.630
role-- that our
role, eventually,

00:24:51.630 --> 00:24:55.110
as we were named anchors
and managing editors--

00:24:55.110 --> 00:24:59.370
was to model for them what's
important about journalism.

00:24:59.370 --> 00:25:02.250
- Tell me about y'all being
named managing editors.

00:25:02.250 --> 00:25:04.534
Jim Lehrer decides to step down.

00:25:04.534 --> 00:25:06.075
Did this come as a
surprise that they

00:25:06.075 --> 00:25:07.440
were going to pull the
two of you together?

00:25:07.440 --> 00:25:09.270
- Well, when Jim
first stepped down,

00:25:09.270 --> 00:25:11.170
we had a rotating
set of anchors there,

00:25:11.170 --> 00:25:13.872
because we had an amazing
team of correspondents.

00:25:13.872 --> 00:25:15.830
All of you who watched
the News Hour know this.

00:25:15.830 --> 00:25:21.270
But Margaret Warner,
Jeffrey Brown, Ray Suarez

00:25:21.270 --> 00:25:22.347
was with us at the time.

00:25:22.347 --> 00:25:24.430
And of course, we have
some incredible journalists

00:25:24.430 --> 00:25:26.170
who have joined us since then.

00:25:26.170 --> 00:25:28.380
But in the beginning, there
was a rotation system.

00:25:28.380 --> 00:25:33.060
And then in 2013, the
decision was made to name Gwen

00:25:33.060 --> 00:25:34.435
and me co-anchors.

00:25:34.435 --> 00:25:36.060
We had already worked
together the year

00:25:36.060 --> 00:25:39.190
before, co-anchoring and
sitting at the conventions--

00:25:39.190 --> 00:25:41.430
the Democratic and
Republican conventions.

00:25:41.430 --> 00:25:44.250
In 2012, we had anchored
election night together.

00:25:44.250 --> 00:25:47.790
We were working very closely
together at that time.

00:25:47.790 --> 00:25:50.970
And Walter, what I'll tell
you was when we were named

00:25:50.970 --> 00:25:54.000
and when it was clear that this
was really going to happen,

00:25:54.000 --> 00:25:57.180
we had a long,
private talk together.

00:25:57.180 --> 00:26:01.230
And we decided that what was the
most important thing of all was

00:26:01.230 --> 00:26:02.100
that not only--

00:26:02.100 --> 00:26:04.150
I already knew what an
incredible journalist

00:26:04.150 --> 00:26:06.930
Gwen is, I know what
a friend she was

00:26:06.930 --> 00:26:08.610
to me and to so many others.

00:26:08.610 --> 00:26:12.330
But more than anything, we knew
that we had each other's back.

00:26:12.330 --> 00:26:15.600
I knew if I messed up on
the air, said something,

00:26:15.600 --> 00:26:18.240
she was going to be the
one to gently correct it.

00:26:18.240 --> 00:26:21.600
She didn't make
mistakes, so I didn't

00:26:21.600 --> 00:26:23.610
have to worry about doing that.

00:26:23.610 --> 00:26:27.245
But quite seriously, we
had each other's backs.

00:26:27.245 --> 00:26:29.370
- Well, wait, tell me more
about that conversation.

00:26:29.370 --> 00:26:31.929
This was a real, physical,
a dinner or something?

00:26:31.929 --> 00:26:32.970
And what did you all say?

00:26:32.970 --> 00:26:35.520
- Well, it was actually a
number of dinners and lunches

00:26:35.520 --> 00:26:38.630
and conversation that just
went on for days and days.

00:26:38.630 --> 00:26:42.650
But this was after knew we
were taking over the show.

00:26:42.650 --> 00:26:45.980
And what Gwen
always said to me--

00:26:45.980 --> 00:26:48.320
and I want to say
this again, because I

00:26:48.320 --> 00:26:52.220
think it came up in the
panel earlier this morning--

00:26:52.220 --> 00:26:55.220
we view our role
at the News Hour

00:26:55.220 --> 00:26:58.490
as the custodians of something
that's been handed to us.

00:26:58.490 --> 00:27:02.162
What Robin MacNeil and
Jim Lehrer started in 1975

00:27:02.162 --> 00:27:03.620
after the Watergate
hearings-- they

00:27:03.620 --> 00:27:06.440
came together to create
MacNeil-Lehrer Report.

00:27:06.440 --> 00:27:09.080
The kind of journalism
they believe in

00:27:09.080 --> 00:27:11.240
is the kind of journalism
we believe in--

00:27:11.240 --> 00:27:14.090
journalism that is about
informing and, when we can,

00:27:14.090 --> 00:27:19.040
analyzing and clarifying and
bringing light and not heat.

00:27:19.040 --> 00:27:20.640
And I know that's
become a cliche.

00:27:20.640 --> 00:27:22.010
You hear it all the time.

00:27:22.010 --> 00:27:23.480
But we really do mean it.

00:27:23.480 --> 00:27:26.480
And we really do mean
that we're not here

00:27:26.480 --> 00:27:28.280
to have a noisy argument.

00:27:28.280 --> 00:27:29.840
It's got to remain civil.

00:27:29.840 --> 00:27:32.090
But it has to also remain vital.

00:27:32.090 --> 00:27:34.700
People have to feel
when they're watching,

00:27:34.700 --> 00:27:36.410
when they're
engaging in whatever

00:27:36.410 --> 00:27:39.530
we're doing, whether it's
online or even in social media,

00:27:39.530 --> 00:27:42.140
that we're doing something
that they understand matters

00:27:42.140 --> 00:27:42.830
to them.

00:27:42.830 --> 00:27:46.070
So Gwen and I were committed
to that and that we were really

00:27:46.070 --> 00:27:49.190
just the temporary
custodians of the News Hour.

00:27:49.190 --> 00:27:51.950
We want the News Hour
to be passed on to--

00:27:51.950 --> 00:27:54.260
I think Jonah Goldberg
said this earlier--

00:27:54.260 --> 00:27:56.120
we want the
journalism we do to be

00:27:56.120 --> 00:27:59.050
passed on to the next
generation and the next one.

00:27:59.050 --> 00:28:01.640
And so whatever we
do right now, we

00:28:01.640 --> 00:28:05.780
knew was going to set an example
for the young people around us.

00:28:05.780 --> 00:28:08.780
- Well, that's what it is
to be part of an institution

00:28:08.780 --> 00:28:12.502
is to realize it's larger
than just yourself.

00:28:12.502 --> 00:28:14.210
And one of the things
you brought to it--

00:28:14.210 --> 00:28:16.460
I know we're celebrating
Gwen-- but very much

00:28:16.460 --> 00:28:18.690
you personally brought
to it, too, was

00:28:18.690 --> 00:28:21.830
that deeply earnest honesty.

00:28:21.830 --> 00:28:25.700
And I remember when we were
young and in our salad days

00:28:25.700 --> 00:28:28.430
and you were covering Jimmy
Carter and then you and Al

00:28:28.430 --> 00:28:31.100
and I doing Reagan,
there was just

00:28:31.100 --> 00:28:35.450
no question of having a
private or secret agenda.

00:28:35.450 --> 00:28:38.090
How do you bring that
into a world today?

00:28:38.090 --> 00:28:41.360
- Well, again, this came out
in the panel this morning,

00:28:41.360 --> 00:28:43.310
and I think everybody was there.

00:28:43.310 --> 00:28:46.580
No politician wants
to bring bad news.

00:28:46.580 --> 00:28:50.000
No politician wants to
share the worst things

00:28:50.000 --> 00:28:53.780
that are going on in his or
her life or his or her career

00:28:53.780 --> 00:28:57.680
or whatever battle he
or she is engaged in.

00:28:57.680 --> 00:28:59.979
So you don't expect
you go to a politician

00:28:59.979 --> 00:29:01.520
and they're going
to bare their soul.

00:29:01.520 --> 00:29:04.935
You go into covering
politics, understanding

00:29:04.935 --> 00:29:07.310
that they want to give you--
they're always going to want

00:29:07.310 --> 00:29:08.570
to give you the best side.

00:29:08.570 --> 00:29:12.230
Having said that, you
do expect them to level

00:29:12.230 --> 00:29:14.750
with you at ground level--

00:29:14.750 --> 00:29:16.400
that they're not
going to mislead you

00:29:16.400 --> 00:29:18.960
about the fundamentals
of what they believe in.

00:29:18.960 --> 00:29:21.664
And that is what I think
we want to preserve

00:29:21.664 --> 00:29:22.580
in this country that--

00:29:22.580 --> 00:29:24.240
- Has that changed?

00:29:24.240 --> 00:29:26.420
- Well, I think
in some respects,

00:29:26.420 --> 00:29:29.510
it has, because I think today--

00:29:29.510 --> 00:29:32.780
I think because of this crazy,
complicated media environment

00:29:32.780 --> 00:29:35.120
we're in-- and we
can talk about this--

00:29:35.120 --> 00:29:37.010
I think it's easier
for politicians

00:29:37.010 --> 00:29:43.310
to skirt around what is the
core that they're working on,

00:29:43.310 --> 00:29:45.570
what is the core
of their belief.

00:29:45.570 --> 00:29:49.040
And when they do that,
they don't necessarily

00:29:49.040 --> 00:29:51.410
want to come clean.

00:29:51.410 --> 00:29:55.450
They don't feel it's in their
interest to be straight.

00:29:55.450 --> 00:29:58.759
But we, as reporters, have to
constantly ask those questions.

00:29:58.759 --> 00:30:00.800
- But one of the things
about the media landscape

00:30:00.800 --> 00:30:02.960
is that the
balkanization of it has

00:30:02.960 --> 00:30:05.450
led to so much more
opinions but now,

00:30:05.450 --> 00:30:09.560
as we heard this morning,
also different sets of facts.

00:30:09.560 --> 00:30:12.830
How do we fight against that?

00:30:12.830 --> 00:30:15.790
- Well, first of all, there's
a place for opinion journalism.

00:30:15.790 --> 00:30:18.020
Again, I'm going to quote
Jonah Goldberg again.

00:30:18.020 --> 00:30:20.150
There is a place for
opinion journalism

00:30:20.150 --> 00:30:22.580
in our great democratic society.

00:30:22.580 --> 00:30:24.950
We are all about
debate and argument.

00:30:24.950 --> 00:30:28.340
That's what makes us the
great country that we are.

00:30:28.340 --> 00:30:31.760
But I came along with
the old-fashioned kind

00:30:31.760 --> 00:30:37.070
of journalism in which you
have to base the opinion

00:30:37.070 --> 00:30:39.020
on an agreed set of facts.

00:30:39.020 --> 00:30:41.510
And yes, you can debate
around the margins.

00:30:41.510 --> 00:30:47.840
But to say, I'm going to ignore
an entire set of data that

00:30:47.840 --> 00:30:50.907
has been clearly
backed up, and say,

00:30:50.907 --> 00:30:52.490
we're not going to
look at that, we're

00:30:52.490 --> 00:30:53.510
going to go in
another direction,

00:30:53.510 --> 00:30:55.277
because it doesn't
suit our argument--

00:30:55.277 --> 00:30:57.110
I don't think that
serves us as a democracy.

00:30:57.110 --> 00:30:58.610
- And do we have the right--

00:30:58.610 --> 00:31:01.400
I say "we," been
a while since I've

00:31:01.400 --> 00:31:05.600
been a journalist-- the right
to now say, that's just a lie?

00:31:05.600 --> 00:31:08.275
Because we used to not say that.

00:31:08.275 --> 00:31:08.900
- You're right.

00:31:08.900 --> 00:31:09.400
We didn't.

00:31:12.230 --> 00:31:14.660
I'm pretty careful
about calling something

00:31:14.660 --> 00:31:18.251
a lie, because to me, a lie gets
at the motivation behind what

00:31:18.251 --> 00:31:18.750
somebody--

00:31:18.750 --> 00:31:21.980
I think we can comfortably
say, if we know what

00:31:21.980 --> 00:31:24.320
someone has said is false--

00:31:24.320 --> 00:31:27.230
if we know demonstrably
that this happened--

00:31:27.230 --> 00:31:30.830
that A happened and the
person said B happened,

00:31:30.830 --> 00:31:32.600
we can point that out.

00:31:32.600 --> 00:31:33.680
Absolutely, we can.

00:31:33.680 --> 00:31:34.730
We should.

00:31:34.730 --> 00:31:38.180
Calling someone a liar
or saying, that is a lie,

00:31:38.180 --> 00:31:39.896
you're ascribing
a motive to them.

00:31:39.896 --> 00:31:41.270
I don't think we
need to do that.

00:31:41.270 --> 00:31:44.330
I think our viewers, the
people who follow us,

00:31:44.330 --> 00:31:47.810
follow any news organization--
you're smart enough to know

00:31:47.810 --> 00:31:48.440
if--

00:31:48.440 --> 00:31:50.780
you know what happened if
you've seen it reported,

00:31:50.780 --> 00:31:52.820
if you've read enough about it.

00:31:52.820 --> 00:31:55.670
And if the politician or
whomever you're talking to

00:31:55.670 --> 00:31:57.380
is telling it a
completely different way,

00:31:57.380 --> 00:32:00.650
or the journalist, you
see the difference.

00:32:00.650 --> 00:32:03.019
And so it's self-evident.

00:32:03.019 --> 00:32:05.060
- Those of you who were
at the panel this morning

00:32:05.060 --> 00:32:09.030
know by quoting Jonah
Goldberg a few times,

00:32:09.030 --> 00:32:11.210
we're trying to
destroy his career

00:32:11.210 --> 00:32:15.882
by having him favorably accepted
in Cambridge, Massachusetts.

00:32:15.882 --> 00:32:19.490
And we're waiting for
Breitbart to come down on him.

00:32:19.490 --> 00:32:21.800
But one of the
things he also said

00:32:21.800 --> 00:32:24.230
was that we totally missed it--

00:32:24.230 --> 00:32:26.206
that it wasn't just
about Donald Trump,

00:32:26.206 --> 00:32:27.830
and it wasn't just
that we didn't quite

00:32:27.830 --> 00:32:31.220
understand Donald Trump-- that
for the past 10 to 15 years,

00:32:31.220 --> 00:32:34.940
we have missed what's happening
that's not on the coast.

00:32:34.940 --> 00:32:38.990
- Oh, I think there is an
absolute truth to that, Walter.

00:32:38.990 --> 00:32:41.569
I think for all the
good things that

00:32:41.569 --> 00:32:43.610
have happened in the media,
we've got more smart,

00:32:43.610 --> 00:32:44.900
young people coming in.

00:32:48.170 --> 00:32:50.460
We've got reporters today
who've been to law school.

00:32:50.460 --> 00:32:51.793
They've been to graduate school.

00:32:51.793 --> 00:32:55.010
They're much more
steeped in science

00:32:55.010 --> 00:32:58.190
or whatever the subject
matter that they're covering.

00:32:58.190 --> 00:33:00.890
So we've got smarter
reporters than we've ever had.

00:33:00.890 --> 00:33:02.930
We've got more sources
of information.

00:33:02.930 --> 00:33:07.330
But I would also argue that we
have climbed into our little

00:33:07.330 --> 00:33:09.320
comfortable places.

00:33:09.320 --> 00:33:11.930
And much of it, as we
know, is right here

00:33:11.930 --> 00:33:14.300
on the east coast,
separated only

00:33:14.300 --> 00:33:18.020
by a few hours on the Acela.

00:33:18.020 --> 00:33:21.590
Between Washington and New
York and Boston, we're here.

00:33:21.590 --> 00:33:23.360
We're doing great work.

00:33:23.360 --> 00:33:26.030
But what about the
rest of the country?

00:33:26.030 --> 00:33:31.880
What about places like
Pennsylvania, like Michigan,

00:33:31.880 --> 00:33:37.850
like my birth state of Oklahoma,
like Colorado, New Mexico where

00:33:37.850 --> 00:33:39.800
yes, there's some
journalism, but there

00:33:39.800 --> 00:33:42.740
isn't enough of the
kind of journalism

00:33:42.740 --> 00:33:44.930
to really understand
what people's lives are.

00:33:44.930 --> 00:33:47.840
- So what are you
doing at the News Hour

00:33:47.840 --> 00:33:49.400
to try to remedy this?

00:33:49.400 --> 00:33:52.100
- Well, we are
doing everything we

00:33:52.100 --> 00:33:55.550
can to talk to people,
to send reporters out,

00:33:55.550 --> 00:33:58.130
to get a sense of America,
whether the subject is

00:33:58.130 --> 00:34:01.720
health care, education,
science, politics--

00:34:01.720 --> 00:34:05.150
to talk to Americans
in all walks of life,

00:34:05.150 --> 00:34:06.500
no matter where they live.

00:34:06.500 --> 00:34:07.970
But you know what, Walter?

00:34:07.970 --> 00:34:11.750
It gets at the business
model of journalism.

00:34:11.750 --> 00:34:14.630
Everybody here knows
newspapers have closed down

00:34:14.630 --> 00:34:17.630
by the hundreds and hundreds
over the last decade, 15 years.

00:34:17.630 --> 00:34:21.290
We've lost tens of
thousands of reporters.

00:34:21.290 --> 00:34:25.310
We don't have as many people
out asking questions, doing

00:34:25.310 --> 00:34:28.040
the kind of deep,
dirty, hard work,

00:34:28.040 --> 00:34:31.639
document reporting that we need
to understand this country.

00:34:31.639 --> 00:34:34.909
And without that and
without people getting out

00:34:34.909 --> 00:34:40.489
into these places, whether it's
Michigan, Oregon, you name it,

00:34:40.489 --> 00:34:43.460
and talking, again, to
real people on the ground,

00:34:43.460 --> 00:34:48.139
understanding their lives, we
can't reflect this country back

00:34:48.139 --> 00:34:48.699
to--

00:34:48.699 --> 00:34:50.900
my view of what
journalism is, is we

00:34:50.900 --> 00:34:54.020
should be holding a mirror
up to the American people.

00:34:54.020 --> 00:34:57.860
We should be saying, here's
where we're doing well,

00:34:57.860 --> 00:35:00.110
and here's where we
need work, and here's

00:35:00.110 --> 00:35:03.620
what you need to know to be a
good citizen, to make decisions

00:35:03.620 --> 00:35:05.660
about not just how
you're going to vote,

00:35:05.660 --> 00:35:08.900
but how to think about the
people who are making decisions

00:35:08.900 --> 00:35:10.190
for you in Washington.

00:35:10.190 --> 00:35:14.300
And unless we are out there
talking to those people,

00:35:14.300 --> 00:35:18.500
getting their view,
hearing from them,

00:35:18.500 --> 00:35:21.710
and, frankly,
respecting that view,

00:35:21.710 --> 00:35:25.100
even when it differs
from ours, and giving it

00:35:25.100 --> 00:35:28.700
equal time or more time,
then I don't think--

00:35:28.700 --> 00:35:31.370
we're not doing our job holding
up a mirror to this country.

00:35:31.370 --> 00:35:33.740
I think we've done a lot
of things really well.

00:35:33.740 --> 00:35:35.510
But I also think we've
got a lot of work

00:35:35.510 --> 00:35:37.760
to do when it comes
to that mirror.

00:35:37.760 --> 00:35:41.270
And I mean that in every regard.

00:35:41.270 --> 00:35:43.550
We've done a much
better job, I think,

00:35:43.550 --> 00:35:46.340
of including women in
the work that we do,

00:35:46.340 --> 00:35:49.340
of including minorities,
although, goodness knows,

00:35:49.340 --> 00:35:51.170
we've got so much
more work to do there.

00:35:51.170 --> 00:35:53.690
But we also need to get
out and cover people

00:35:53.690 --> 00:35:59.150
who live in rural areas and
cover the industries that we

00:35:59.150 --> 00:36:01.550
don't see on the east coast.

00:36:01.550 --> 00:36:06.350
- Also, the destruction of the
business model for journalism--

00:36:06.350 --> 00:36:08.570
EJ said it's the best
and worst of times.

00:36:08.570 --> 00:36:11.700
It's, in some ways, the best of
times for a lot of journalism

00:36:11.700 --> 00:36:13.920
but the worst of times
for a business model.

00:36:13.920 --> 00:36:17.310
That's decimated
international reporting.

00:36:17.310 --> 00:36:22.186
How do you try to keep
that in the forefront?

00:36:22.186 --> 00:36:24.060
- Well, what we've done,
I can just tell you,

00:36:24.060 --> 00:36:26.520
at the News Hour-- and I know
other news organizations are

00:36:26.520 --> 00:36:27.400
committed to this.

00:36:27.400 --> 00:36:28.920
They've deployed correspondents.

00:36:28.920 --> 00:36:32.190
Between the Associated Press,
The New York Times, Wall Street

00:36:32.190 --> 00:36:35.250
Journal, Washington Post, and
so many other organizations

00:36:35.250 --> 00:36:38.010
that have just absolutely
remained committed

00:36:38.010 --> 00:36:42.150
to covering the world, despite
the resource challenges that we

00:36:42.150 --> 00:36:45.450
all face, what we've had
to do is work more and more

00:36:45.450 --> 00:36:46.260
in partnership.

00:36:46.260 --> 00:36:48.420
We have partnership with
the Pulitzer Center,

00:36:48.420 --> 00:36:51.060
for example-- the Pulitzer
Center for Crisis Reporting--

00:36:51.060 --> 00:36:54.000
with other, frankly,
new organizations

00:36:54.000 --> 00:36:58.860
that have cropped up that are
able to get correspondents,

00:36:58.860 --> 00:37:03.390
reporters into countries that
we otherwise wouldn't be in.

00:37:03.390 --> 00:37:05.700
We had a reporter, for
example, in South Sudan

00:37:05.700 --> 00:37:08.920
doing several pieces for
us just a few days ago.

00:37:08.920 --> 00:37:11.820
We've had reporters in
Iraq and other places.

00:37:11.820 --> 00:37:15.360
We don't have the wherewithal
on the News Hour budget

00:37:15.360 --> 00:37:17.850
to go cover these places
and cover them all the time.

00:37:17.850 --> 00:37:20.760
So we have to enter into
these partnership agreements.

00:37:20.760 --> 00:37:23.700
And we're trying to do that
all the time-- to get people

00:37:23.700 --> 00:37:27.469
into whether it's
China, Korea, Taiwan.

00:37:27.469 --> 00:37:29.010
There are so many
parts of the planet

00:37:29.010 --> 00:37:32.610
that I think go uncovered,
or it's insufficiently

00:37:32.610 --> 00:37:34.350
covered right now.

00:37:34.350 --> 00:37:38.610
- What do you say to those
who say that the News

00:37:38.610 --> 00:37:43.000
Hour and the mainstream press,
in general, is just too elite,

00:37:43.000 --> 00:37:46.080
too aimed at a certain group--

00:37:46.080 --> 00:37:49.410
aging, elite group.

00:37:49.410 --> 00:37:51.970
I'm speaking to a tent
full of the aging elites.

00:37:51.970 --> 00:37:53.730
So we're not necessarily
against that.

00:37:53.730 --> 00:37:57.180
- You're not going to let him
get away with it, are you?

00:37:57.180 --> 00:38:03.316
- But isn't there an elitism to
some of what you've just said--

00:38:03.316 --> 00:38:05.940
that people don't want this, but
we're going to still try to do

00:38:05.940 --> 00:38:06.120
it?

00:38:06.120 --> 00:38:08.100
- Well, in terms of
age, this is anecdotal.

00:38:08.100 --> 00:38:10.980
But last night, as I'm waiting
at the Washington National

00:38:10.980 --> 00:38:14.700
Airport to fly to Boston,
a couple of 20-somethings

00:38:14.700 --> 00:38:17.340
came up to me with their
boyfriends and said,

00:38:17.340 --> 00:38:20.141
we never miss the News
Hour, we watch it together.

00:38:20.141 --> 00:38:20.640
They--

00:38:20.640 --> 00:38:24.170
[APPLAUSE]

00:38:24.170 --> 00:38:26.100
- Good.

00:38:26.100 --> 00:38:27.760
- We did selfies.

00:38:27.760 --> 00:38:31.810
And I expected them to say
they listened to us on podcast

00:38:31.810 --> 00:38:32.950
or on their wristwatch.

00:38:32.950 --> 00:38:36.530
They said, no, we sit in front
of a television and watch.

00:38:36.530 --> 00:38:41.110
But to get to your question,
sure, our audience skews older.

00:38:41.110 --> 00:38:44.210
Those are the folks who grew
up with Walter Cronkite,

00:38:44.210 --> 00:38:46.240
Huntley-Brinkley,
John Chancellor, who

00:38:46.240 --> 00:38:49.960
was a mentor of mine when
I was at NBC, and others.

00:38:49.960 --> 00:38:51.580
And that's perfectly fine.

00:38:51.580 --> 00:38:54.970
But we also have to be
madly figuring out--

00:38:54.970 --> 00:38:57.580
and we are-- how to reach
the younger generation.

00:38:57.580 --> 00:39:00.100
And that means being
available wherever they are.

00:39:00.100 --> 00:39:04.390
And so without getting into
all the nitty gritty of it,

00:39:04.390 --> 00:39:09.580
if you've checked out our
web page PBS.org/NewsHour,

00:39:09.580 --> 00:39:13.330
you will see there are many,
many more stories there than we

00:39:13.330 --> 00:39:16.090
possibly would have room
to put on the program.

00:39:16.090 --> 00:39:20.950
But again, Walter, to your
point about being elite--

00:39:20.950 --> 00:39:23.046
and I think it
reflects back to what

00:39:23.046 --> 00:39:24.670
I said a moment ago--
this is something

00:39:24.670 --> 00:39:28.360
we have to worry about.

00:39:28.360 --> 00:39:31.480
I looked around our
newsroom the other day.

00:39:31.480 --> 00:39:33.580
We've all gone to good colleges.

00:39:33.580 --> 00:39:35.350
We've gotten a great education.

00:39:35.350 --> 00:39:38.270
We live in Washington
or New York

00:39:38.270 --> 00:39:41.800
or one of these great,
amazing centers of higher

00:39:41.800 --> 00:39:45.250
education on the east coast.

00:39:45.250 --> 00:39:49.330
Are we really in touch
with most Americans?

00:39:49.330 --> 00:39:51.440
And I don't want
to repeat myself.

00:39:51.440 --> 00:39:52.870
But we've got to work at that.

00:39:52.870 --> 00:39:56.110
We've got to bring journalists
into the newsroom who

00:39:56.110 --> 00:39:59.380
come from outside of
Washington and New York.

00:39:59.380 --> 00:40:01.660
As I said, I was born
in Tulsa, Oklahoma.

00:40:01.660 --> 00:40:04.180
I grew up as an army brat
living all over the world.

00:40:04.180 --> 00:40:06.850
I lived in Missouri
and New Jersey and back

00:40:06.850 --> 00:40:09.010
in Oklahoma and Georgia--

00:40:09.010 --> 00:40:10.930
Augusta, Georgia--
for a number of years.

00:40:10.930 --> 00:40:12.656
So I bring a little of that.

00:40:12.656 --> 00:40:13.780
But it was a long time ago.

00:40:13.780 --> 00:40:17.530
We need young people coming in
from all parts of this country

00:40:17.530 --> 00:40:20.320
and internationally
who can reflect

00:40:20.320 --> 00:40:22.625
the different backgrounds
that they bring.

00:40:22.625 --> 00:40:24.250
In fact, it's something
Gwen and I used

00:40:24.250 --> 00:40:25.374
to talk about all the time.

00:40:25.374 --> 00:40:29.560
We have to have a diversity of
backgrounds in this newsroom,

00:40:29.560 --> 00:40:31.070
or we're not doing our job.

00:40:31.070 --> 00:40:32.950
We're not reflecting
this country.

00:40:32.950 --> 00:40:34.120
We have to do that.

00:40:34.120 --> 00:40:37.450
And we have to guard
against that elite mindset

00:40:37.450 --> 00:40:40.870
that only those folks who
went to good colleges--

00:40:40.870 --> 00:40:43.750
they have a reservoir,
and they know everything.

00:40:43.750 --> 00:40:44.710
And yes, they're smart.

00:40:44.710 --> 00:40:48.320
And gosh knows, they bring
great ideas to what we do.

00:40:48.320 --> 00:40:49.570
And we need to broaden it out.

00:40:49.570 --> 00:40:52.060
- One of the things you
and Gwen broadened out

00:40:52.060 --> 00:40:54.700
was the talking
heads on your show.

00:40:54.700 --> 00:40:56.710
Suddenly, they
looked different, IE,

00:40:56.710 --> 00:41:00.560
they weren't all just
white, male elite.

00:41:00.560 --> 00:41:02.050
Was that a conscious effort?

00:41:02.050 --> 00:41:03.820
How did you do that?

00:41:03.820 --> 00:41:04.990
- It was a conscious effort.

00:41:04.990 --> 00:41:06.090
It is a conscious effort.

00:41:06.090 --> 00:41:09.100
It started under Jim Lehrer
and even before that.

00:41:09.100 --> 00:41:13.030
As you may remember, the
first sidekick, if you will,

00:41:13.030 --> 00:41:15.370
for Jim Lehrer and Robert
MacNeil was Charlayne

00:41:15.370 --> 00:41:17.300
Hunter-Gault who
was a remarkable--

00:41:17.300 --> 00:41:18.790
[APPLAUSE]

00:41:18.790 --> 00:41:19.290
- Still is.

00:41:19.290 --> 00:41:20.040
- Give her a hand.

00:41:20.040 --> 00:41:21.080
Still is.

00:41:21.080 --> 00:41:23.537
Remarkable pioneer of the
Civil Rights Movement,

00:41:23.537 --> 00:41:25.120
integrated the
University of Georgia--

00:41:25.120 --> 00:41:26.620
she's still involved
in the program.

00:41:26.620 --> 00:41:29.320
She still does special
reporting for us.

00:41:29.320 --> 00:41:31.210
And of course, Charlayne
was with the program

00:41:31.210 --> 00:41:34.450
for I think 15 years
and then with NPR.

00:41:34.450 --> 00:41:36.712
So Jim and Robin, from
the very beginning,

00:41:36.712 --> 00:41:38.920
have had a commitment to
women, have had a commitment

00:41:38.920 --> 00:41:40.240
to diversity.

00:41:40.240 --> 00:41:42.626
I joined the program
first in 1983.

00:41:42.626 --> 00:41:44.250
They wanted a Washington
correspondent.

00:41:44.250 --> 00:41:46.090
I left NBC to come
to the program,

00:41:46.090 --> 00:41:48.460
because Jim and Robin
told me specifically,

00:41:48.460 --> 00:41:52.790
we want a woman to have an
important role in the program.

00:41:52.790 --> 00:41:55.000
And when I was off
wandering in the wilderness,

00:41:55.000 --> 00:41:58.199
as Jim used to say,
of cable television--

00:41:58.199 --> 00:41:58.990
- Wait, wait, wait.

00:41:58.990 --> 00:41:59.781
We worked together.

00:41:59.781 --> 00:42:02.050
- --where at one point,
Walter Isaacson was my boss

00:42:02.050 --> 00:42:04.692
as president of CNN.

00:42:04.692 --> 00:42:06.400
He knows where all
the bodies are buried.

00:42:09.310 --> 00:42:11.890
But at that point when
I was away from the News

00:42:11.890 --> 00:42:14.170
Hour was, of course,
when Gwen came in.

00:42:14.170 --> 00:42:17.080
And it was because Jim
wanted somebody, of course,

00:42:17.080 --> 00:42:19.480
with the amazing
journalist that Gwen is.

00:42:19.480 --> 00:42:22.222
But it was the commitment to
making that newsroom look more

00:42:22.222 --> 00:42:22.930
like the country.

00:42:22.930 --> 00:42:25.120
- You've talked about a
couple of mentors already--

00:42:25.120 --> 00:42:28.600
John Chancellor
and now Jim Lehrer.

00:42:28.600 --> 00:42:30.970
Tell me about the
role of mentors

00:42:30.970 --> 00:42:34.720
when you were a woman
coming up in the business.

00:42:34.720 --> 00:42:37.930
- Well, I would love to tell you
that there were very many women

00:42:37.930 --> 00:42:38.560
mentors.

00:42:38.560 --> 00:42:43.480
The truth is, there
weren't any, because--

00:42:43.480 --> 00:42:47.440
I think you heard the story
from Dean Cohen a minute ago--

00:42:47.440 --> 00:42:52.107
when I applied for a job as a--

00:42:52.107 --> 00:42:54.190
actually, I was applying
for a job as a secretary,

00:42:54.190 --> 00:42:57.430
because they told me there
were no jobs for reporters.

00:42:57.430 --> 00:43:02.192
The answer was, I guess we'll
hire you, but, as you said,

00:43:02.192 --> 00:43:04.150
we already have a woman
reporter, how could you

00:43:04.150 --> 00:43:05.260
possibly be interested?

00:43:05.260 --> 00:43:08.140
After I went to work
as a reporter, one

00:43:08.140 --> 00:43:13.300
of the men in the newsroom
said, we've already

00:43:13.300 --> 00:43:18.460
got one blonde reporter,
why do we need anybody

00:43:18.460 --> 00:43:20.320
else here who wears skirts?

00:43:20.320 --> 00:43:25.560
It was this kind of open
attitude, if you will.

00:43:25.560 --> 00:43:27.330
But you know what?

00:43:27.330 --> 00:43:29.280
It never deterred me.

00:43:29.280 --> 00:43:32.250
I have to give credit to my
amazing mother who passed away

00:43:32.250 --> 00:43:35.004
four years ago.

00:43:35.004 --> 00:43:36.420
She not only didn't
go to college,

00:43:36.420 --> 00:43:38.220
she couldn't finish high school.

00:43:38.220 --> 00:43:40.580
She barely was able
to finish 10th grade.

00:43:40.580 --> 00:43:42.270
Her father passed away.

00:43:42.270 --> 00:43:44.820
She stayed home to take
care of her siblings.

00:43:44.820 --> 00:43:47.820
And she always said to me,
get your education, diapers

00:43:47.820 --> 00:43:50.880
and dishes can wait, get your
education, get your education.

00:43:50.880 --> 00:43:52.623
And so I--

00:43:52.623 --> 00:43:54.435
[APPLAUSE]

00:43:54.435 --> 00:43:57.740
I carry that with
me every single day.

00:43:57.740 --> 00:44:00.170
And when you ask, who
are my role models,

00:44:00.170 --> 00:44:02.870
my mother was a role model,
even though she did not--

00:44:02.870 --> 00:44:04.750
- From Oklahoma.

00:44:04.750 --> 00:44:08.000
- She was born in Missouri,
grew up in Tulsa, Oklahoma.

00:44:08.000 --> 00:44:10.130
She is my principal role model.

00:44:10.130 --> 00:44:13.310
And beyond that, in this
career, there were women.

00:44:13.310 --> 00:44:15.170
There was a woman
named Cassie Mackin

00:44:15.170 --> 00:44:17.150
who covered politics for NBC--

00:44:17.150 --> 00:44:18.230
- What a tragic tale.

00:44:18.230 --> 00:44:20.605
- --who went out of her way--
who died tragically at such

00:44:20.605 --> 00:44:21.219
a young age.

00:44:21.219 --> 00:44:22.760
She went out of her
way to welcome me

00:44:22.760 --> 00:44:26.337
when I joined NBC after I'd
been in local news in Atlanta.

00:44:26.337 --> 00:44:28.170
And there have been
others along the way who

00:44:28.170 --> 00:44:28.550
have been incredible.

00:44:28.550 --> 00:44:30.590
- Well, Pauline Frederick,
Nancy Dickerson [INAUDIBLE].

00:44:30.590 --> 00:44:32.080
- Nancy Dickerson,
Pauline Fred--

00:44:32.080 --> 00:44:33.170
you've done your homework.

00:44:33.170 --> 00:44:33.940
- No, no.

00:44:33.940 --> 00:44:34.540
I'm just old.

00:44:34.540 --> 00:44:36.500
I remember them all.

00:44:36.500 --> 00:44:38.000
- And then of course,
along the way,

00:44:38.000 --> 00:44:39.740
to be able to work
with the greats--

00:44:39.740 --> 00:44:42.470
you can go down the list,
the women of my generation--

00:44:42.470 --> 00:44:45.800
Lesley Stahl, Connie Chung,
Diane Sawyer-- the women

00:44:45.800 --> 00:44:48.510
who came in about
the same time I have.

00:44:48.510 --> 00:44:51.830
And today, look around--
not just in television,

00:44:51.830 --> 00:44:53.270
but in print.

00:44:53.270 --> 00:44:55.100
Look at the people
who are breaking news

00:44:55.100 --> 00:44:58.700
right now in The New York
Times and The Washington Post--

00:44:58.700 --> 00:45:03.760
Karen Tumulty at The Washington
Post, Ashley Parker--

00:45:03.760 --> 00:45:04.700
the names come.

00:45:04.700 --> 00:45:06.120
- Don't forget Maggie Haberman.

00:45:06.120 --> 00:45:09.230
- I'm saying at The New York
Times, Maggie Haberman these

00:45:09.230 --> 00:45:13.670
are reporters who are young and
doing remarkable work at all

00:45:13.670 --> 00:45:15.024
these news organizations.

00:45:15.024 --> 00:45:16.190
They're making a difference.

00:45:16.190 --> 00:45:18.040
I have to say,
Walter, though, we

00:45:18.040 --> 00:45:20.570
are not doing a good
enough job with women

00:45:20.570 --> 00:45:22.070
in management of news.

00:45:22.070 --> 00:45:23.280
Not a single head--

00:45:23.280 --> 00:45:26.260
[APPLAUSE]

00:45:26.260 --> 00:45:27.930
We are blessed at the News Hour.

00:45:27.930 --> 00:45:30.820
Our executive producer
is a woman, Sara Just,

00:45:30.820 --> 00:45:33.130
who succeeded another
woman executive

00:45:33.130 --> 00:45:35.130
producer, Linda Winslow--

00:45:35.130 --> 00:45:38.290
two phenomenal journalists.

00:45:38.290 --> 00:45:42.280
The person who runs the station
that sponsors the News Hour,

00:45:42.280 --> 00:45:44.170
Sharon Rockefeller--
she's the president

00:45:44.170 --> 00:45:46.420
of WETA, our sponsoring station.

00:45:46.420 --> 00:45:50.140
So we have amazing
women role model.

00:45:50.140 --> 00:45:50.890
- And PBS.

00:45:50.890 --> 00:45:51.720
- And PBS--

00:45:51.720 --> 00:45:53.810
Paula Kerger is
the president, PBS.

00:45:53.810 --> 00:45:56.200
So we're doing well.

00:45:56.200 --> 00:45:58.040
We don't take
anything for granted.

00:45:58.040 --> 00:46:00.580
But I will tell you, as I
look around the landscape,

00:46:00.580 --> 00:46:04.360
there's not a woman running a
commercial broadcast network

00:46:04.360 --> 00:46:06.190
news division, unless
something changed

00:46:06.190 --> 00:46:07.210
in the last few minutes.

00:46:09.946 --> 00:46:11.570
Look at the newspapers
in this country.

00:46:11.570 --> 00:46:13.028
We don't have enough
women editors.

00:46:13.028 --> 00:46:14.860
We need more Ann
Marie Lipinskis.

00:46:14.860 --> 00:46:17.290
We need more Jill Abramsons.

00:46:17.290 --> 00:46:20.020
We need more Amanda
Bennetts-- the women

00:46:20.020 --> 00:46:24.520
who have run great newspapers,
been newspaper editors.

00:46:24.520 --> 00:46:26.860
So we've come a long way.

00:46:26.860 --> 00:46:29.959
But we have to keep pushing.

00:46:29.959 --> 00:46:31.000
Why do you think, Walter?

00:46:31.000 --> 00:46:34.450
I'm going to turn
the tables on you.

00:46:34.450 --> 00:46:38.860
Why don't we have more women
bosses at these great news

00:46:38.860 --> 00:46:39.820
organizations?

00:46:39.820 --> 00:46:41.830
- It's endemic in our society.

00:46:41.830 --> 00:46:44.620
I worry about it even
more in tech companies,

00:46:44.620 --> 00:46:48.790
in Silicon Valley,
and innovation.

00:46:48.790 --> 00:46:52.720
And I think it's still a
basic level of discrimination.

00:46:52.720 --> 00:46:59.260
I think people-- one cut below
taking them as seriously as you

00:46:59.260 --> 00:47:00.790
would a man saying--

00:47:00.790 --> 00:47:03.100
you have seen it, and
I have seen it now

00:47:03.100 --> 00:47:05.320
that I've tried to
be attuned to it.

00:47:05.320 --> 00:47:06.580
Go around the table.

00:47:06.580 --> 00:47:08.710
People have different ideas.

00:47:08.710 --> 00:47:10.990
And yet, all the
sudden, a good idea

00:47:10.990 --> 00:47:13.450
gets attributed to a man
who didn't actually say it.

00:47:16.810 --> 00:47:19.630
- And yet, you have you have
multiple women presidents

00:47:19.630 --> 00:47:20.890
of great universities--

00:47:20.890 --> 00:47:22.870
Drew Faust, Nan
Keohane who's sitting

00:47:22.870 --> 00:47:27.070
right here, who was president of
Duke University, my alma mater.

00:47:27.070 --> 00:47:30.530
So we know there's a lot
of female talent out there.

00:47:30.530 --> 00:47:32.240
But it's a complicated--

00:47:32.240 --> 00:47:34.390
- So let me go back to Gwen.

00:47:34.390 --> 00:47:41.260
Do you think that she felt more
of an obstacle being a woman

00:47:41.260 --> 00:47:41.920
or being black?

00:47:44.440 --> 00:47:48.105
- We had this conversation
on several occasions.

00:47:52.420 --> 00:47:55.720
I know that she felt being a
person of color was harder.

00:47:55.720 --> 00:48:00.797
But it was the dual package that
made it really hard for her.

00:48:00.797 --> 00:48:02.880
Gwen didn't go around with
a chip on her shoulder.

00:48:02.880 --> 00:48:04.780
She didn't go
around complaining.

00:48:04.780 --> 00:48:06.550
That was not who she was.

00:48:06.550 --> 00:48:11.660
But she was informed and
shaped by her own experiences.

00:48:11.660 --> 00:48:17.880
And that's what made her the
remarkable, path-breaking,

00:48:17.880 --> 00:48:22.077
relentless, never-say-die
journalist that she was,

00:48:22.077 --> 00:48:24.160
because she had been through
what she went through

00:48:24.160 --> 00:48:28.600
at the Boston Herald-- because
she experienced so much of that

00:48:28.600 --> 00:48:31.900
on the campaign trail following
presidential candidates--

00:48:31.900 --> 00:48:34.030
senatorial, gubernatorial
candidates--

00:48:34.030 --> 00:48:36.550
interviewing people,
having people mistake her

00:48:36.550 --> 00:48:39.070
for something else--

00:48:39.070 --> 00:48:42.010
the maid in the
hotel, rather than

00:48:42.010 --> 00:48:45.040
the person who was there
to interview the candidate.

00:48:45.040 --> 00:48:48.160
She rose above all that.

00:48:48.160 --> 00:48:50.500
And we would joke about it.

00:48:50.500 --> 00:48:52.660
She was a PK, she called it--

00:48:52.660 --> 00:48:53.784
Preacher's Kid.

00:48:53.784 --> 00:48:56.200
I was an army brat, so we would
talk about the experience.

00:48:56.200 --> 00:49:01.810
But there's no question that
her experience growing up

00:49:01.810 --> 00:49:05.800
in the life that she had, the
obstacles she had overcome

00:49:05.800 --> 00:49:10.390
helped to make her the pioneer,
the extraordinary journalist

00:49:10.390 --> 00:49:11.020
that she was.

00:49:11.020 --> 00:49:12.280
It shaped her.

00:49:12.280 --> 00:49:15.530
And it made her more
powerful as a presence.

00:49:15.530 --> 00:49:20.110
And we have to give her more
credit as a result of that.

00:49:20.110 --> 00:49:20.760
She deserves--

00:49:20.760 --> 00:49:23.066
[APPLAUSE]

00:49:27.560 --> 00:49:30.000
I speak of her in the present
tense, because, like I said,

00:49:30.000 --> 00:49:32.870
she's sitting right here.

00:49:32.870 --> 00:49:35.210
She deserves much
more credit because

00:49:35.210 --> 00:49:38.630
of what she and other
journalists of color

00:49:38.630 --> 00:49:41.960
go through every day-- people
of color in this country go

00:49:41.960 --> 00:49:43.970
through every day, still.

00:49:43.970 --> 00:49:46.550
Here we are, how many
hundred and so many years

00:49:46.550 --> 00:49:48.900
past the Civil War, and
we're still fighting.

00:49:48.900 --> 00:49:51.980
And decades past the
Civil Rights Movement,

00:49:51.980 --> 00:49:54.620
we still are fighting
these battles.

00:49:54.620 --> 00:49:58.430
We are still on the
front lines, if you will.

00:49:58.430 --> 00:50:00.530
And all of us have
to come together

00:50:00.530 --> 00:50:04.970
to talk about it openly
and to confront it

00:50:04.970 --> 00:50:10.340
and to get ahead of it,
because if we don't, we

00:50:10.340 --> 00:50:13.140
are hurting the next generation
and the generation after them.

00:50:13.140 --> 00:50:15.495
[APPLAUSE]

00:50:20.210 --> 00:50:24.450
- I never heard her
be bitter or complain.

00:50:24.450 --> 00:50:28.930
She was always-- almost
made light and up about it.

00:50:28.930 --> 00:50:33.630
But you were in a
special bond with her.

00:50:33.630 --> 00:50:38.437
What did you all talk
about when it got bad?

00:50:38.437 --> 00:50:40.020
- Well, I haven't
even shared with you

00:50:40.020 --> 00:50:42.720
the really important
link that we had.

00:50:42.720 --> 00:50:47.370
I told this story at Gwen's
service after she died.

00:50:47.370 --> 00:50:50.506
And that is that we
realized that if it

00:50:50.506 --> 00:50:52.380
had been two guys sitting
next to each other,

00:50:52.380 --> 00:50:56.340
you wouldn't have to worry about
two guys, two suits, two ties.

00:50:56.340 --> 00:50:58.530
But with women, we couldn't
show up both wearing

00:50:58.530 --> 00:51:01.860
red, both wearing yellow.

00:51:01.860 --> 00:51:07.080
So we would email
each other each night,

00:51:07.080 --> 00:51:12.240
wearing green, wearing pink.

00:51:12.240 --> 00:51:15.630
But what we laughed about was
after a few months of doing

00:51:15.630 --> 00:51:18.120
this, we just kind of
intuited what the other one

00:51:18.120 --> 00:51:18.870
was going to wear.

00:51:18.870 --> 00:51:22.559
We didn't even have to
do the emails anymore.

00:51:22.559 --> 00:51:23.100
We just knew.

00:51:23.100 --> 00:51:23.599
It.

00:51:23.599 --> 00:51:25.980
There was one day when we
both showed up in blue.

00:51:25.980 --> 00:51:28.820
And it was OK.

00:51:28.820 --> 00:51:35.700
But when the going got tough,
we confided in each other.

00:51:35.700 --> 00:51:36.790
I'd go into her office.

00:51:36.790 --> 00:51:37.510
She would come into mine.

00:51:37.510 --> 00:51:39.150
They were right
next to each other.

00:51:39.150 --> 00:51:41.790
And we would say, oh, my
gosh, what are we going to do,

00:51:41.790 --> 00:51:45.615
or we're going to get
through this together.

00:51:45.615 --> 00:51:46.710
You can't work that--

00:51:46.710 --> 00:51:48.324
- You have an example?

00:51:48.324 --> 00:51:49.740
- No, I'm not going
to share this.

00:51:49.740 --> 00:51:52.650
- Just with them.

00:51:52.650 --> 00:51:54.900
- Office politics.

00:51:54.900 --> 00:51:56.670
No, seriously.

00:51:56.670 --> 00:51:59.670
No, what I'll say
is that what really

00:51:59.670 --> 00:52:04.140
matters in a team, whether
you're a television anchor team

00:52:04.140 --> 00:52:05.640
or whether you're
together running--

00:52:05.640 --> 00:52:07.556
I'm sure this is the
case-- running a business

00:52:07.556 --> 00:52:11.460
or running a university is that
the people at the top, the team

00:52:11.460 --> 00:52:13.470
have to be able to
trust each other.

00:52:13.470 --> 00:52:17.310
And we knew we had to trust each
other, as I said a minute ago,

00:52:17.310 --> 00:52:20.910
have each other's backs,
or we couldn't convey.

00:52:20.910 --> 00:52:25.440
We couldn't do our work and
project it for the audience.

00:52:25.440 --> 00:52:29.100
When you're sitting there on
election night or at a debate

00:52:29.100 --> 00:52:31.530
or at a convention--
for example,

00:52:31.530 --> 00:52:34.770
as we did just last summer,
the Republican and Democratic

00:52:34.770 --> 00:52:37.380
National conventions--
and it's spontaneous--

00:52:37.380 --> 00:52:39.450
you don't know what's
going to happen--

00:52:39.450 --> 00:52:43.950
you have to be able to trust, to
know that if you say something

00:52:43.950 --> 00:52:46.830
stupid, that the
other person is going

00:52:46.830 --> 00:52:49.922
to carefully, or sometimes
not so carefully, correct you.

00:52:49.922 --> 00:52:50.630
- Bring you back.

00:52:50.630 --> 00:52:52.510
- But we had that kind
of a relationship.

00:52:52.510 --> 00:52:54.592
And I give her
almost all the credit

00:52:54.592 --> 00:52:57.050
for that, because she was the
generous human being that she

00:52:57.050 --> 00:52:57.550
was.

00:52:57.550 --> 00:53:00.240
- Let me interrupt there,
because I know how generous

00:53:00.240 --> 00:53:02.590
you've been to so many people.

00:53:02.590 --> 00:53:07.240
So I know you share that
generosity, and it's important.

00:53:07.240 --> 00:53:08.430
Let me end--

00:53:08.430 --> 00:53:10.950
[APPLAUSE]

00:53:10.950 --> 00:53:14.840
And I do think that you all
are the two most intellectually

00:53:14.840 --> 00:53:16.370
honest people I know.

00:53:16.370 --> 00:53:19.430
But you both, with
the spirit you had,

00:53:19.430 --> 00:53:23.450
were the two most generous
people I know in the business.

00:53:23.450 --> 00:53:24.937
The traditional last question--

00:53:24.937 --> 00:53:26.770
- I'm going to start
to believe all this is,

00:53:26.770 --> 00:53:29.300
so he's got to stop.

00:53:29.300 --> 00:53:33.330
- It has the added
virtue of being true.

00:53:33.330 --> 00:53:37.970
The traditional last
question for this awardee

00:53:37.970 --> 00:53:41.120
is, what advice would you give
to a young person coming up

00:53:41.120 --> 00:53:42.260
in your field?

00:53:42.260 --> 00:53:43.610
We'll end with this.

00:53:43.610 --> 00:53:44.780
- Jump in.

00:53:44.780 --> 00:53:48.740
We need more good,
smart journalists today

00:53:48.740 --> 00:53:50.090
than we have ever needed.

00:53:50.090 --> 00:53:52.904
And this happens all the time.

00:53:52.904 --> 00:53:54.320
They come up to
me in our newsroom

00:53:54.320 --> 00:53:57.500
and as I move around
Washington and other places.

00:53:57.500 --> 00:53:59.134
They come up and
they say, should I

00:53:59.134 --> 00:54:01.550
really go into journalism,
what's happening to journalism?

00:54:01.550 --> 00:54:03.174
And I say, look, I
can't tell you where

00:54:03.174 --> 00:54:04.790
we're going to be in 10 years.

00:54:04.790 --> 00:54:07.350
I can't even tell you where
we're going to be next year.

00:54:07.350 --> 00:54:10.130
But what I can tell you is that
the American people are always

00:54:10.130 --> 00:54:13.820
going to need reporters who
are prepared to put themselves

00:54:13.820 --> 00:54:17.510
on the line, to go out there
with an insatiable curiosity,

00:54:17.510 --> 00:54:20.720
find stories, find answers
to tough questions,

00:54:20.720 --> 00:54:23.990
hold our public
leaders accountable.

00:54:23.990 --> 00:54:26.750
We need the next generation
and the generation

00:54:26.750 --> 00:54:28.430
after that to do that.

00:54:28.430 --> 00:54:29.270
Jump in.

00:54:29.270 --> 00:54:31.010
The water's great.

00:54:31.010 --> 00:54:32.300
We need you.

00:54:32.300 --> 00:54:34.150
We've never needed
you more than now.

00:54:34.150 --> 00:54:36.012
So if you have the curiosity--

00:54:36.012 --> 00:54:37.970
if you don't care what
kind of hours you keep--

00:54:37.970 --> 00:54:44.630
if you can live on a little
bit of sleep and you love--

00:54:44.630 --> 00:54:46.700
journalism is the most, to me--

00:54:46.700 --> 00:54:49.460
I can't imagine doing anything
other than journalism.

00:54:49.460 --> 00:54:52.220
What more interesting
field can there be?

00:54:52.220 --> 00:54:55.190
You are constantly in contact
with interesting people.

00:54:55.190 --> 00:54:57.920
So what I say to young
journalists is, jump in,

00:54:57.920 --> 00:55:02.600
don't hesitate, get your
good liberal arts education,

00:55:02.600 --> 00:55:06.020
and then think about
what part of journalism

00:55:06.020 --> 00:55:06.950
you want to work in.

00:55:06.950 --> 00:55:09.960
But there's always going to
be a need in our democracy

00:55:09.960 --> 00:55:11.420
for great reporting.

00:55:11.420 --> 00:55:15.410
- President Faust,
in her baccalaureate,

00:55:15.410 --> 00:55:19.610
talked about the moral
imperative of noticing.

00:55:19.610 --> 00:55:21.500
And you have been
an exemplar of that.

00:55:21.500 --> 00:55:22.291
Thank you, Judy.

00:55:22.291 --> 00:55:22.790
- Thank you.

00:55:22.790 --> 00:55:24.600
I'm going to get this.

00:55:24.600 --> 00:55:26.200
- Thank you so much.

00:55:26.200 --> 00:55:27.524
- Bravo.

00:55:27.524 --> 00:55:28.508
- OK.

00:55:28.508 --> 00:55:29.976
Thank you.

00:55:29.976 --> 00:55:30.476
OK.

00:55:33.440 --> 00:55:35.900
- Thank you so much,
Walter and Judy,

00:55:35.900 --> 00:55:38.840
for this illuminating
conversation.

00:55:38.840 --> 00:55:42.650
Anyone who watched
Judy and Gwen could not

00:55:42.650 --> 00:55:45.050
help but notice
the true friendship

00:55:45.050 --> 00:55:46.320
that they seemed to share.

00:55:46.320 --> 00:55:50.180
And I think we got a very good
look at that this afternoon.

00:55:50.180 --> 00:55:54.860
A gift for friendship was
one of Gwen's many talents.

00:55:54.860 --> 00:55:58.070
So I would like to invite
another of Gwen's closest

00:55:58.070 --> 00:55:59.810
friends to the podium.

00:55:59.810 --> 00:56:02.210
Please welcome
journalist and author

00:56:02.210 --> 00:56:06.874
Michele Norris who will
accept Gwen's Radcliffe Medal

00:56:06.874 --> 00:56:07.790
and share a few words.

00:56:07.790 --> 00:56:14.860
[APPLAUSE]

00:56:14.860 --> 00:56:20.410
Now I will read the citation
for Gwen's Radcliffe Medal.

00:56:20.410 --> 00:56:24.550
"She raised tough
questions, told hard truths,

00:56:24.550 --> 00:56:27.400
and held fiercely to fact.

00:56:27.400 --> 00:56:31.350
She illuminated the news
to inform the public,

00:56:31.350 --> 00:56:36.750
strengthen civil society, and
inspire future journalists."

00:56:36.750 --> 00:56:39.850
Thank you, Michele Norris,
for accepting Gwen Ifill's

00:56:39.850 --> 00:56:43.800
Radcliffe Medal, given with
our greatest admiration

00:56:43.800 --> 00:56:45.690
for her excellence
in journalism.

00:56:45.690 --> 00:56:48.185
[APPLAUSE]

00:56:58.680 --> 00:57:04.420
- It is my great honor to accept
this award for my dear friend.

00:57:04.420 --> 00:57:09.260
She so badly wanted
to be here today.

00:57:09.260 --> 00:57:14.780
She was very humble, as you've
heard, in taking her laurels.

00:57:14.780 --> 00:57:18.130
But she also enjoyed it.

00:57:18.130 --> 00:57:19.810
She had a special
place in her home

00:57:19.810 --> 00:57:24.350
where she posted all of her
awards and her mini hoods.

00:57:24.350 --> 00:57:27.400
And she knew, in
part, that when she

00:57:27.400 --> 00:57:29.890
was able to accept
an award like this,

00:57:29.890 --> 00:57:32.170
she was able to shine her
light in a special way

00:57:32.170 --> 00:57:35.250
so those who came
behind her could see it.

00:57:35.250 --> 00:57:37.960
You've heard over and over
and over again, mentoring

00:57:37.960 --> 00:57:40.530
was important to Gwen.

00:57:40.530 --> 00:57:42.450
Telling hard truths
was important.

00:57:42.450 --> 00:57:44.610
But holding those
truths up was important,

00:57:44.610 --> 00:57:48.717
but also holding her life up
as an example was important.

00:57:48.717 --> 00:57:50.550
She would have loved
that this happened here

00:57:50.550 --> 00:57:53.310
in Boston, because
her road to journalism

00:57:53.310 --> 00:57:55.020
began here in Boston.

00:57:55.020 --> 00:57:57.460
And Dean, you talked
about the story--

00:57:57.460 --> 00:57:59.910
what happened in the newsroom,
the horrible thing that

00:57:59.910 --> 00:58:01.380
was written at her desk.

00:58:01.380 --> 00:58:04.260
You saw the beginnings of who
she became as a journalist

00:58:04.260 --> 00:58:06.510
and as a person in how
she responded to that.

00:58:06.510 --> 00:58:09.990
She thought that, that
can't possibly be for me.

00:58:09.990 --> 00:58:11.850
And she just kept going.

00:58:11.850 --> 00:58:13.380
She would have
loved that this was

00:58:13.380 --> 00:58:16.470
in an institution of learning,
because she felt so strongly

00:58:16.470 --> 00:58:17.730
that she wanted to spend time.

00:58:17.730 --> 00:58:20.280
And even when she was
struggling with her illness,

00:58:20.280 --> 00:58:22.560
she still made time
to be with mentors

00:58:22.560 --> 00:58:24.240
and to be with young
people, because she

00:58:24.240 --> 00:58:28.480
wanted them to follow her
into the role of journalism.

00:58:28.480 --> 00:58:30.880
As a woman of color--

00:58:30.880 --> 00:58:32.920
I'm not going to share
her age, because she

00:58:32.920 --> 00:58:35.620
would fuss at me
for doing something

00:58:35.620 --> 00:58:37.330
like that at a podium--

00:58:37.330 --> 00:58:39.940
but as a woman of
her generation,

00:58:39.940 --> 00:58:42.909
it meant that she
was often the first.

00:58:42.909 --> 00:58:44.950
She rolled the mantle of
being the first person--

00:58:44.950 --> 00:58:47.380
the first person to host
a presidential debate

00:58:47.380 --> 00:58:49.720
as a woman of color,
the first person to host

00:58:49.720 --> 00:58:51.550
a major political program.

00:58:51.550 --> 00:58:55.561
And that helps you understand
who she was as a journalist.

00:58:55.561 --> 00:58:57.310
But I want to talk a
little bit, if I can,

00:58:57.310 --> 00:58:59.470
in just a few moments
about the first

00:58:59.470 --> 00:59:02.110
that she represented that
also helped us understand

00:59:02.110 --> 00:59:04.030
who she was as a human being.

00:59:04.030 --> 00:59:06.460
Yes, she was the first person
to ask a tough question.

00:59:06.460 --> 00:59:08.770
She was the first person
to see holes in a story.

00:59:08.770 --> 00:59:10.830
She was the first
person to submit copy.

00:59:10.830 --> 00:59:14.670
She was a wicked fast writer.

00:59:14.670 --> 00:59:17.690
She was the first person
often to spot trends

00:59:17.690 --> 00:59:20.930
or to push boundaries
and enforce standards.

00:59:20.930 --> 00:59:22.460
But she was also
the first person,

00:59:22.460 --> 00:59:24.770
as Judy mentioned, to
help a young reporter.

00:59:24.770 --> 00:59:27.710
She was the first person to make
herself available to someone

00:59:27.710 --> 00:59:29.780
new in the newsroom.

00:59:29.780 --> 00:59:31.700
She was the first, and
sometimes the only,

00:59:31.700 --> 00:59:35.270
person to take the time to greet
the security guards every day.

00:59:35.270 --> 00:59:36.650
She knew their names.

00:59:36.650 --> 00:59:37.910
She knew their birthdays.

00:59:37.910 --> 00:59:40.612
She knew when their kids
were graduating from college.

00:59:40.612 --> 00:59:43.070
She was the first to sing "Happy
Birthday" to the woman who

00:59:43.070 --> 00:59:45.620
answered the phones
at The Washington Post

00:59:45.620 --> 00:59:48.660
when we first worked together.

00:59:48.660 --> 00:59:50.720
I met Gwen at The
Washington Post.

00:59:50.720 --> 00:59:52.497
And it was almost 30 years ago.

00:59:52.497 --> 00:59:54.830
And for the past 30 years,
we've lived about five blocks

00:59:54.830 --> 00:59:55.370
from each other.

00:59:55.370 --> 00:59:56.450
She was my best friend.

00:59:56.450 --> 00:59:59.150
She was the maid of
honor in my wedding.

00:59:59.150 --> 01:00:00.860
She is godmother to my children.

01:00:00.860 --> 01:00:02.480
And I got to know her well.

01:00:02.480 --> 01:00:05.060
And so I also
understood that she

01:00:05.060 --> 01:00:08.540
knew that if you exercised
power in small ways,

01:00:08.540 --> 01:00:11.730
you could more easily claim
the mantle in other ways.

01:00:11.730 --> 01:00:14.900
And so she was the
first to call someone

01:00:14.900 --> 01:00:18.620
during tough times, the first to
arrive to help lay out the hors

01:00:18.620 --> 01:00:22.020
d'oeuvres for a nervous host,
because she could spot that.

01:00:22.020 --> 01:00:26.040
She was the first to understand
and enforce the first rule

01:00:26.040 --> 01:00:28.880
of friendship-- no competition.

01:00:28.880 --> 01:00:30.680
We remained friends,
even though we often

01:00:30.680 --> 01:00:33.200
competed with each
other in the newsroom.

01:00:33.200 --> 01:00:35.920
Our career paths followed
a similar trajectory.

01:00:35.920 --> 01:00:37.170
We met at The Washington Post.

01:00:37.170 --> 01:00:39.330
She went to NBC.

01:00:39.330 --> 01:00:40.190
I went to ABC.

01:00:40.190 --> 01:00:41.240
She went to PBS.

01:00:41.240 --> 01:00:42.235
I went to NPR.

01:00:42.235 --> 01:00:43.610
And Judy, you
should know that we

01:00:43.610 --> 01:00:47.330
were informed by watching you
and your years-long and lovely

01:00:47.330 --> 01:00:49.610
and very strong friendship
with Andrea Mitchell.

01:00:49.610 --> 01:00:52.520
We knew that we would be
stronger if we held together.

01:00:52.520 --> 01:00:56.266
And we decided not to
compete against each other.

01:00:56.266 --> 01:00:58.140
She was the first, as
one of our dear friends

01:00:58.140 --> 01:01:01.110
told us, to know what
you needed before you

01:01:01.110 --> 01:01:03.240
knew what you needed,
the first to say

01:01:03.240 --> 01:01:04.930
"yes" to be by your side.

01:01:04.930 --> 01:01:06.480
Ertharin Cousin is
in the audience.

01:01:06.480 --> 01:01:10.050
And she, for a number of years,
was Director of the World Food

01:01:10.050 --> 01:01:11.580
Program in Italy.

01:01:11.580 --> 01:01:13.614
And when Gwen figured
that she was lonely,

01:01:13.614 --> 01:01:15.030
she was the first
to say, you know

01:01:15.030 --> 01:01:17.040
what, I think you need
someone by your side,

01:01:17.040 --> 01:01:19.170
even if it meant
jumping the pond

01:01:19.170 --> 01:01:20.730
and going to visit her in Italy.

01:01:20.730 --> 01:01:23.280
She was the first, as
[INAUDIBLE] told me today,

01:01:23.280 --> 01:01:25.380
to tell us that
it's going to be OK,

01:01:25.380 --> 01:01:28.020
even when she wasn't even
sure of it of herself.

01:01:28.020 --> 01:01:30.607
But she could help
us understand that.

01:01:30.607 --> 01:01:31.940
She was OK with being the first.

01:01:31.940 --> 01:01:36.040
But she always wanted to make
sure that she was not the last.

01:01:36.040 --> 01:01:40.420
So she knew that she
couldn't just bust down doors

01:01:40.420 --> 01:01:42.370
but that she had
to hold them open.

01:01:42.370 --> 01:01:45.790
You see, it's easier
to bust down a door

01:01:45.790 --> 01:01:48.550
than to actually hold it open.

01:01:48.550 --> 01:01:50.356
You can muscle your
way through a door.

01:01:50.356 --> 01:01:51.730
But if you hold
the door open, it

01:01:51.730 --> 01:01:54.040
means that you have to stay
at that door sometimes when

01:01:54.040 --> 01:01:56.620
other people-- you can hear
them in the distance having fun,

01:01:56.620 --> 01:01:58.420
moving on, doing other things.

01:01:58.420 --> 01:02:02.720
To hold the door open, you
have to lift while you climb.

01:02:02.720 --> 01:02:04.720
You have to always be
thinking of the people who

01:02:04.720 --> 01:02:06.657
are coming behind you.

01:02:06.657 --> 01:02:08.740
And so maybe we can think
about that, particularly

01:02:08.740 --> 01:02:12.400
in a room full of so
many accomplished women.

01:02:12.400 --> 01:02:14.480
What are we doing not
just to open the door--

01:02:14.480 --> 01:02:16.392
[APPLAUSE]

01:02:16.392 --> 01:02:18.304
--but to hold the door open?

01:02:22.620 --> 01:02:25.500
Gwen used to talk about
colored girl moments.

01:02:25.500 --> 01:02:28.150
We were brown girls raised in
a country that didn't imagine

01:02:28.150 --> 01:02:29.977
these kinds of jobs for us.

01:02:29.977 --> 01:02:32.060
And on big days, she would
call and she would say,

01:02:32.060 --> 01:02:35.190
I had a colored
girl moment today,

01:02:35.190 --> 01:02:41.480
I interviewed Elton John,
I interviewed Colin Powell.

01:02:44.040 --> 01:02:46.690
This would have been
a colored girl moment.

01:02:46.690 --> 01:02:50.240
She would have
loved this moment.

01:02:50.240 --> 01:02:53.090
I'm wearing a very
bright jacket today.

01:02:53.090 --> 01:02:54.594
My husband said
that if I wore this,

01:02:54.594 --> 01:02:56.260
I would look like a
walking highlighter.

01:02:56.260 --> 01:02:58.200
[LAUGHTER]

01:03:05.970 --> 01:03:08.580
But I share this because
it reflects a colored girl

01:03:08.580 --> 01:03:10.140
moment for Gwen.

01:03:10.140 --> 01:03:12.150
You will remember
her from hosting

01:03:12.150 --> 01:03:14.220
a series of vice
presidential debates

01:03:14.220 --> 01:03:18.360
and, not long ago with
Judy, a presidential debate

01:03:18.360 --> 01:03:22.070
in Milwaukee with Hillary
Clinton and Bernie Sanders.

01:03:22.070 --> 01:03:25.010
When she first did the first
vice presidential debate

01:03:25.010 --> 01:03:26.690
with Dick Cheney
and John Edwards,

01:03:26.690 --> 01:03:29.540
she was told by the vice
presidential committee

01:03:29.540 --> 01:03:33.780
that maybe she should wear a
demure jacket, because that's

01:03:33.780 --> 01:03:34.780
what the guys always do.

01:03:34.780 --> 01:03:36.070
They wore something dark.

01:03:36.070 --> 01:03:41.310
And it would make her look
more authoritative, they said.

01:03:41.310 --> 01:03:43.050
I went shopping
with Gwen when she

01:03:43.050 --> 01:03:47.400
decided what she was going to
wear for that first debate.

01:03:47.400 --> 01:03:49.086
And if you remember
her picture--

01:03:49.086 --> 01:03:51.210
and again, when she was
portrayed by Queen Latifah,

01:03:51.210 --> 01:03:53.220
she also wore the
same color jacket--

01:03:53.220 --> 01:03:56.980
and it was a very bright
and resplendent blue.

01:03:56.980 --> 01:03:58.750
She was not going to
wear something dark.

01:03:58.750 --> 01:04:00.070
And you know why she decided--

01:04:00.070 --> 01:04:01.720
at least one reason why
she decided-- to wear

01:04:01.720 --> 01:04:02.844
that bright colored jacket?

01:04:02.844 --> 01:04:05.731
She said, I want to make sure
the ancestors can see me.

01:04:05.731 --> 01:04:08.086
[LAUGHTER, APPLAUSE]

01:04:11.860 --> 01:04:13.840
And so when she hosted
her second debate,

01:04:13.840 --> 01:04:17.750
she wore turquoise, doing
that with a broken ankle,

01:04:17.750 --> 01:04:19.400
as we remember.

01:04:19.400 --> 01:04:21.440
And when she did the
debate in Milwaukee,

01:04:21.440 --> 01:04:24.410
she was resplendent in purple.

01:04:24.410 --> 01:04:26.111
She wanted the
ancestors to see her,

01:04:26.111 --> 01:04:27.860
but she also wanted
people who were coming

01:04:27.860 --> 01:04:32.210
behind her to see her as well.

01:04:32.210 --> 01:04:34.370
She's forever holding
open doors, even now,

01:04:34.370 --> 01:04:38.450
through her legacy, which
we uphold through our work

01:04:38.450 --> 01:04:41.780
and which Radcliffe
upholds with this award.

01:04:41.780 --> 01:04:44.450
I loved being her friend.

01:04:44.450 --> 01:04:48.000
I am only now getting used to
saying that in the past tense.

01:04:48.000 --> 01:04:49.880
It will never feel right.

01:04:49.880 --> 01:04:52.220
I cherished being her colleague.

01:04:52.220 --> 01:04:56.240
And I am so very honored
to accept this award

01:04:56.240 --> 01:04:57.560
on her behalf.

01:04:57.560 --> 01:05:01.134
From the entire Ifill family,
thank you very, very much.

01:05:01.134 --> 01:05:04.116
[APPLAUSE]

01:05:27.475 --> 01:05:30.800
- And now Judy,
finally, the time

01:05:30.800 --> 01:05:34.640
has come to award
your Radcliffe Medal.

01:05:34.640 --> 01:05:38.480
And I will now read the
citation we've written for you.

01:05:38.480 --> 01:05:44.870
"She exemplifies intelligence,
integrity, and determination.

01:05:44.870 --> 01:05:49.460
She pursues truth with
courage and conviction.

01:05:49.460 --> 01:05:54.470
She inspires us all to
safeguard freedom of the press

01:05:54.470 --> 01:05:58.790
as an essential foundation
of our democracy."

01:05:58.790 --> 01:06:01.730
Judy Woodruff, I
bestow upon you,

01:06:01.730 --> 01:06:04.100
and if you would come
forward, this Radcliffe

01:06:04.100 --> 01:06:08.390
Medal, with the deepest
admiration for a lifetime

01:06:08.390 --> 01:06:10.060
of excellence in journalism.

01:06:10.060 --> 01:06:12.540
[APPLAUSE]

01:06:13.532 --> 01:06:15.020
- Thank you.

01:06:15.020 --> 01:06:16.508
This is so special.

01:06:16.508 --> 01:06:17.500
Thank you, Liz.

01:06:17.500 --> 01:06:19.090
- And then this is your--

01:06:19.090 --> 01:06:20.080
- Thank you.

01:06:20.080 --> 01:06:23.545
Thank you.

01:06:23.545 --> 01:06:25.030
Wow.

01:06:25.030 --> 01:06:26.515
- And I'll give
you the little box.

01:06:26.515 --> 01:06:27.010
So you can take that.

01:06:27.010 --> 01:06:27.510
- Oh, good.

01:06:27.510 --> 01:06:28.495
Thank you.

01:06:28.495 --> 01:06:29.980
Thank you.

01:06:29.980 --> 01:06:32.950
Thank you.

01:06:32.950 --> 01:06:34.435
I'm very touched.

01:06:38.420 --> 01:06:42.490
- Well, it's been quite a day.

01:06:42.490 --> 01:06:48.512
Thank you, of course, to Judy
and to Michele and to Walter

01:06:48.512 --> 01:06:51.160
and to our wonderful panelists
this morning for giving us

01:06:51.160 --> 01:06:52.870
an incredible experience.

01:06:52.870 --> 01:06:54.490
And I just want to
thank all of you

01:06:54.490 --> 01:06:58.270
here in the audience for helping
to make today's Radcliffe

01:06:58.270 --> 01:06:59.260
Day so special.

01:06:59.260 --> 01:07:02.620
So thank you for joining
us for Radcliffe Day 2017.

01:07:02.620 --> 01:07:04.120
[APPLAUSE]

01:07:04.120 --> 01:07:07.470
[MUSIC PLAYING]
