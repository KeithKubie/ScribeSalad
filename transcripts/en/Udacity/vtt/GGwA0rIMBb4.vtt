00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:04.342
Now we have a formal f statistic. That is the ratio of between group

00:00:04.342 --> 00:00:09.290
variability to within group variability. If we could take all possible f

00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:13.956
statistics, what would this distribution look like. Well let's start with what

00:00:13.956 --> 00:00:18.304
we know. The f statistic is always negative, sometimes negative or never

00:00:18.304 --> 00:00:19.690
negative.
