00:00:03.100 --> 00:00:07.479
The Solar System is the name we give to our
local cosmic backyard. A better way to think

00:00:07.479 --> 00:00:13.519
of it is all the stuff held sway by the Sun’s
gravity: The Sun itself, planets, moons, asteroids,

00:00:13.519 --> 00:00:16.030
comets, dust, and very thin gas.

00:00:16.030 --> 00:00:21.560
If you took a step back — well, a few trillion
steps back — and looked at it from the outside,

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:25.970
you might define the solar system as: the
Sun. That’s because the Sun comprises more

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:30.990
than 98% of the mass of the entire solar system.
The next most massive object, Jupiter, is

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:35.120
only 1/10th the diameter and less than 1%
the mass of the Sun.

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:39.360
But that’s a little unfair. Our solar system
is a pretty amazing place, and you can figure

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:42.300
out a lot of what’s going on in it just
by looking at it.

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:56.690
For thousands of years we had to explore
the solar system stuck on this spinning,

00:00:56.690 --> 00:01:00.580
revolving ball — the Earth. The problem
was, for a long time we didn’t know it was

00:01:00.580 --> 00:01:04.680
a spinning, revolving ball. Well, the ancient
Greeks knew it was a ball — they had even

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:08.970
measured its size to a fair degree of accuracy
— but most thought it was motionless. When

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:13.350
a few folks pointed out that this might not
be the case — like the ancient Greek astronomer

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:18.170
Aristarchus of Samos — they got ignored.
The idea that the sky spins around the Earth

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:23.010
seems obvious when you look up, and when great
minds like those of the astronomer Ptolemy

00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:28.180
and philosopher Aristotle supported that idea,
well, people like Aristarchus got left behind.

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:32.420
The basic thinking was that the Moon, Sun,
and stars were affixed to crystal spheres

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:36.500
that spun around the Earth at different rates.
While it kinda sorta worked to predict the

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:41.630
motions of objects in the sky, in detail it
was really unwieldy, and failed to accurately

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:43.330
predict how the planets should move.

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:49.270
Still, Ptolemy’s idea of a geocentric Universe
stuck around for well over a thousand years.

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:55.299
It was the year 1543 when Nicolaus Copernicus
finally published his work proposing a Sun-centered

00:01:55.299 --> 00:02:01.119
model, much like the one Aristarchus had dreamed
up 2000 years previously. Unfortunately, Copernicus’s

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:05.360
model was also pretty top-heavy, and had a
hard time predicting planetary motions.

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:09.640
The last nail in geocentrism’s coffin came
a few years later, when astronomer Johannes

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:15.240
Kepler made a brilliant mental leap: Based
on observations by his mentor Tycho Brahe,

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:19.540
Kepler realized the planets moved around the
Sun in ellipses, not circles as Copernicus

00:02:19.549 --> 00:02:23.180
had assumed. This fixed everything, including
those aggravating planetary motions. It still

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:27.340
took a while, but heliocentrism won the day.
And the night, too.

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:32.079
This paved the way for Newton to apply physics
and his newly-created math of calculus to

00:02:32.079 --> 00:02:36.409
determine how gravity worked, which in turn
led to our modern understanding of how the

00:02:36.409 --> 00:02:38.319
solar system truly operates.

00:02:38.319 --> 00:02:42.950
The Sun, being the most massive object in
the solar system by far, has the strongest

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:47.650
gravity, and it basically runs the solar system.
In fact, the term “solar” comes from the

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:52.669
word “sol,” for Sun. We named the whole
shebang after the Sun, so there you go.

00:02:52.669 --> 00:02:57.269
The planets are smaller, but still pretty
huge compared to us tiny humans. At the big

00:02:57.269 --> 00:03:02.549
end we have giant Jupiter, 11 times wider
than the Earth and a thousand times its volume.

00:03:02.549 --> 00:03:08.359
At the smaller end, we have…well…there
is no actual smaller “end”. We just kinda

00:03:08.359 --> 00:03:12.439
draw a line and say, “Planets are bigger
than this.” That’s a bit unsatisfactory,

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:15.160
I’ll admit, but it does bring up an interesting
point.

00:03:15.169 --> 00:03:19.700
I’ve been using the term “planet,” but
I haven’t defined it. That’s no accident:

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:24.320
I don’t think you can. A lot of people have
tried, but definitions have always come up

00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:28.400
short. You might say something is a planet
if it’s big enough to be round, but a lot

00:03:28.409 --> 00:03:30.849
of moons are round, and so are some asteroids.

00:03:30.849 --> 00:03:35.669
Maybe a planet has to have moons. Nope; Mercury
and Venus don’t, and many asteroids do.

00:03:35.669 --> 00:03:41.160
Planets are big, right? Well, yeah. But Jupiter’s
moon Ganymede is bigger than Mercury. Should

00:03:41.169 --> 00:03:43.370
Mercury be stripped of its planetary status?

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:47.449
I could go on, but no matter what definition
you come up with, you find there are lots

00:03:47.449 --> 00:03:52.309
of exceptions. That’s a pretty strong indication
that trying to make a rigid definition is

00:03:52.309 --> 00:03:55.469
a mistake; it’ll get you into more trouble
than it’ll help.

00:03:55.469 --> 00:04:00.320
“Planet” can’t be defined; it’s a
concept, like continent. We don’t have a

00:04:00.329 --> 00:04:04.589
definition for continent, and people don’t
seem to mind. Australia is a continent, but

00:04:04.589 --> 00:04:06.949
Greenland isn’t. OK by me.

00:04:06.949 --> 00:04:11.859
So that’s what I tell people if they ask
me if Pluto is a planet. I say, “Tell me

00:04:11.859 --> 00:04:16.169
what a planet is first, and then we can discuss
Pluto.” Pluto is what it is: A fascinating

00:04:16.169 --> 00:04:21.690
and intriguing world, one of thousands, perhaps
millions more orbiting the Sun out past Neptune.

00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:23.410
I think that makes it cool enough.

00:04:23.410 --> 00:04:27.860
All the orbits of the planets lie in a relatively
flat disk. That is, they aren’t buzzing

00:04:27.870 --> 00:04:32.110
around the Sun in all directions like bees
around a hive; the orbit of Mercury, for example,

00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:34.760
lies in pretty much the same plane as that
of Jupiter.

00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:38.820
That’s actually pretty interesting. Whenever
you see a trend in a bunch of objects, nature

00:04:38.830 --> 00:04:43.180
is trying to tell you something. In fact,
there are other trends that are pretty obvious

00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:46.060
when you take a step back and look at the
whole solar system.

00:04:46.060 --> 00:04:50.289
For example, the inner planets — Mercury,
Venus, Earth, and Mars — are all relatively

00:04:50.289 --> 00:04:55.440
small and rocky. The next four — Jupiter,
Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune — are much larger,

00:04:55.440 --> 00:04:59.660
and have tremendously thick atmospheres. In
between Mars and Jupiter is the asteroid belt,

00:04:59.660 --> 00:05:03.360
comprised of billions of rocks. There are
lots more asteroids scattered around the solar

00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:05.300
system, but most are in the main belt.

00:05:05.300 --> 00:05:09.620
Then, out beyond the orbit of Neptune is a
collection of rocky ice balls, called Kuiper

00:05:09.620 --> 00:05:14.180
Belt Objects. The biggest are over a thousand
miles across, but most are far smaller. They

00:05:14.180 --> 00:05:18.280
tend to follow the plane of the planets too.
But if you go even farther out, starting tens

00:05:18.280 --> 00:05:22.979
of billions of kilometers from the Sun, that
disk of Kuiper Belt Objects merges into a

00:05:22.979 --> 00:05:28.039
vast spherical cloud of these ice balls called
the Oort Cloud. They don’t follow the plane

00:05:28.039 --> 00:05:30.289
of the inner solar system, but orbit every
which way.

00:05:30.289 --> 00:05:34.129
So what do all these facts tell us about the
solar system? We think they’re showing us

00:05:34.129 --> 00:05:36.449
hints of how the solar system formed.

00:05:36.449 --> 00:05:42.500
4.6 billion years or so ago, a cloud floated
in space. It was in balance: its gravity trying

00:05:42.500 --> 00:05:46.780
to collapse it was counteracted by the meager
internal heat that buoyed it up. But then

00:05:46.780 --> 00:05:50.699
something happened: Perhaps the shockwave
from a nearby exploding star slammed into

00:05:50.699 --> 00:05:53.330
it, or maybe another cloud lumbered by and
rammed it.

00:05:53.330 --> 00:05:58.050
Either way, the cloud got compressed, upsetting
the balance, and gravity took over. It started

00:05:58.050 --> 00:06:03.259
to collapse. As it did, angular momentum became
important. That’s a lot like regular momentum,

00:06:03.259 --> 00:06:07.210
when an object in motion tends to stay in
motion. But in this case it’s a momentum

00:06:07.210 --> 00:06:12.539
of spin, which depends on the object’s size
and how rapidly it’s rotating. Decrease

00:06:12.539 --> 00:06:17.119
the size, and the rotation rate goes up. The
usual analogy is an ice skater starting a

00:06:17.120 --> 00:06:20.580
spin, then drawing their arms in. Their spin
is amplified hugely.

00:06:20.580 --> 00:06:24.930
The same thing happened in the cloud. Any
small amount of spin it had got ramped up

00:06:24.930 --> 00:06:29.069
as it collapsed. It flattened into a disk,
much like spinning raw pizza dough in the

00:06:29.069 --> 00:06:30.460
air will flatten it out.

00:06:30.460 --> 00:06:34.990
As it collapsed, material fell to the center,
getting very dense and hot. Farther out in

00:06:34.990 --> 00:06:38.979
the disk, where it was cooler, material started
to clump together as little grains of dust

00:06:38.979 --> 00:06:43.560
and other matter randomly bumped into other
little bits. As these clumps grew, their gravity

00:06:43.560 --> 00:06:47.620
increased, and eventually started drawing
more material in. These little blobs are called

00:06:47.620 --> 00:06:50.000
planetesimals — wee baby planets.

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:54.979
As they grew, so did the center of the disk.
The object forming there was a protostar — or,

00:06:54.979 --> 00:07:00.879
spoiler alert, the protosun. Eventually its
center got so hot that hydrogen fused into

00:07:00.880 --> 00:07:02.800
helium, with makes a lot of energy.

00:07:02.800 --> 00:07:04.560
A lot of energy.

00:07:04.560 --> 00:07:10.260
A star was born. The new Sun blasted out fierce
light and heat that, over millions of years,

00:07:10.260 --> 00:07:14.380
blew away the leftover disk material that
hadn’t yet been assimilated into planets.

00:07:14.380 --> 00:07:16.120
The solar system was born.

00:07:16.120 --> 00:07:21.340
Closer to the Sun it was warmer. Hydrogen
and helium are very light gases, and the warm

00:07:21.349 --> 00:07:25.409
baby planets there couldn’t hold on to them.
Farther out, there was more material in the

00:07:25.409 --> 00:07:29.620
disk, and the planets were bigger. Since it
was cooler, too, they could hold on to those

00:07:29.629 --> 00:07:34.879
lighter gases, and their atmospheres grew
tremendously, eventually outmassing the solid

00:07:34.879 --> 00:07:38.240
material in their cores. They became gas giants.

00:07:38.240 --> 00:07:42.610
There was also a lot of water out there, far
from the Sun, in the form of ice. Smaller

00:07:42.610 --> 00:07:47.639
icy objects formed past Neptune, but space
was too big and random encounters too rare.

00:07:47.639 --> 00:07:52.699
They didn’t get very big, maybe a few hundred
kilometers across. A lot of them — billions, perhaps

00:07:52.700 --> 00:07:56.360
trillions of them — got too close to the big
planets, and were flung hither and yon.

00:07:56.360 --> 00:08:00.099
Closer in, material between Mars and Jupiter
couldn’t get its act together to form a

00:08:00.099 --> 00:08:04.830
planet either; Jupiter’s gravity kept agitating
it, and impacts between two bodies tended

00:08:04.830 --> 00:08:07.110
to break them up, not aggregate them together.

00:08:07.110 --> 00:08:11.520
And there you have it. Our solar system, formed
from a disk, sculpted by gravity. Echoes of

00:08:11.520 --> 00:08:15.300
that disk live on today, seen in the flatness
of the solar system.

00:08:15.300 --> 00:08:20.460
This isn’t guesswork: the math and physics
bear this out. And not only that, we see it

00:08:20.789 --> 00:08:25.520
happening, now, today. When we look at gas
clouds in space, we see stars forming, we

00:08:25.520 --> 00:08:30.610
see protoplanetary disks around them, we see
the planets themselves getting their start.

00:08:30.610 --> 00:08:35.840
We may think of ourselves as the solar system,
but we’re really just a solar system. The

00:08:35.840 --> 00:08:40.880
scenario that happened here so long ago plays
itself out daily in the galaxy. We’re one

00:08:40.880 --> 00:08:42.740
of billions of such systems.

00:08:42.740 --> 00:08:48.020
And remember: Every atom in your body, and
everything you see around you — every tree,

00:08:48.030 --> 00:08:52.740
every cloud, every human, every computer,
everything on Earth, even the Earth itself

00:08:52.740 --> 00:08:54.800
— was once part of that dense cloud.

00:08:54.800 --> 00:08:57.180
We are, quite literally, star stuff.

00:08:57.180 --> 00:09:01.620
Today you learned that the solar system is
one star, many planets, a lot more asteroids,

00:09:01.620 --> 00:09:07.040
and even more icy comet-like objects. It formed
from a collapsing cloud, which flattened into

00:09:07.040 --> 00:09:11.570
a disk, and that’s why the solar system
is flat. Rocky planets formed closer to the

00:09:11.570 --> 00:09:16.580
Sun, and larger gas giants farther out. Icy objects
formed beyond Neptune in a disk as well,

00:09:16.580 --> 00:09:20.580
and a lot of them were flung out to form a
spherical shell around the Sun. We see this

00:09:20.580 --> 00:09:24.270
same thing happening out in the galaxy, too.
The motions of the objects in this system

00:09:24.270 --> 00:09:28.290
caused a lot of confusion to ancient astronomers,
but we eventually figured out what’s what.
