00:00:06.684 --> 00:00:09.648
On April 26th, 1937,

00:00:09.648 --> 00:00:15.739
Fascist forces bombed the Basque village 
of Guernica in Northern Spain.

00:00:15.739 --> 00:00:19.327
It was one of the worst civilian 
casualties of the Spanish Civil War,

00:00:19.327 --> 00:00:24.605
waged between the democratic republic and 
General Franco’s fascist contingent.

00:00:24.605 --> 00:00:28.777
For Pablo Picasso, the 
tragedy sparked a frenzied period of work

00:00:28.777 --> 00:00:31.825
in which he produced a 
massive anti-war mural,

00:00:31.825 --> 00:00:34.414
aptly titled "Guernica."

00:00:34.414 --> 00:00:38.306
The painting is a powerful work of 
historical documentation

00:00:38.306 --> 00:00:40.950
and political protest.

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:43.972
But while Picasso’s artistic 
motivations are clear,

00:00:43.972 --> 00:00:49.189
the symbolism of the painting can be as 
confusing and chaotic as war itself.

00:00:49.189 --> 00:00:52.234
How can we make sense of this 
overwhelming image,

00:00:52.234 --> 00:00:57.177
and what exactly makes it a 
masterpiece of anti-war art?

00:00:57.177 --> 00:01:01.681
The painting’s monumental canvas is 
disorienting from the start,

00:01:01.681 --> 00:01:06.625
rendered in the abstracted Cubist style 
Picasso pioneered.

00:01:06.625 --> 00:01:10.852
Cubism deliberately emphasized the 
two-dimensionality of the canvas

00:01:10.852 --> 00:01:13.471
by flattening the objects being painted.

00:01:13.471 --> 00:01:15.483
This afforded viewers multiple

00:01:15.483 --> 00:01:19.308
and often impossible perspectives 
on the same object;

00:01:19.308 --> 00:01:23.580
a technique considered shocking 
even in Picasso’s domestic scenes.

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:25.131
But in this context,

00:01:25.131 --> 00:01:28.271
the style offers a profoundly 
overwhelming view

00:01:28.271 --> 00:01:32.195
of violence, destruction, and casualties.

00:01:32.195 --> 00:01:35.679
Multiple perspectives only compound
the horror on display–

00:01:35.679 --> 00:01:40.787
sending the eyes hurtling around the 
frame in a futile hunt for peace.

00:01:40.787 --> 00:01:45.907
On the far left, a woman holding her 
dead child releases a scream;

00:01:45.907 --> 00:01:49.635
her eyes sliding down her face 
in the shape of tears

00:01:49.635 --> 00:01:54.573
and her head bending back unnaturally 
to echo her baby’s.

00:01:54.573 --> 00:01:57.671
There is the statue of a soldier 
present below,

00:01:57.671 --> 00:02:00.462
but he is unable to defend 
the woman and child.

00:02:00.462 --> 00:02:03.953
Instead his broken body lies in pieces,

00:02:03.953 --> 00:02:09.091
his arm clutching a splintered sword 
in a signal of utmost defeat.

00:02:09.091 --> 00:02:14.423
The tip of his sword meets a woman’s foot 
as she attempts to flee the devastation.

00:02:14.423 --> 00:02:17.337
But her other leg appears 
rooted to the spot,

00:02:17.337 --> 00:02:22.529
locked in the corner of the canvas 
even as she stretches to move it.

00:02:22.529 --> 00:02:26.038
Another victim appears 
behind this slouching figure.

00:02:26.038 --> 00:02:29.711
Falling helplessly as flames 
lick around her,

00:02:29.711 --> 00:02:34.181
she too is caught in her 
own hopeless scene.

00:02:34.181 --> 00:02:38.383
Each of these figures bordering the 
painting are horribly trapped,

00:02:38.383 --> 00:02:41.854
giving the work an acute 
sense of claustrophobia.

00:02:41.854 --> 00:02:46.608
And where you might expect the canvas’ 
massive size to counteract this feeling,

00:02:46.608 --> 00:02:52.714
its scale only highlights the nearly 
life-sized atrocities on display.

00:02:52.714 --> 00:02:55.133
Some possible relief comes from a lamp

00:02:55.133 --> 00:02:58.818
held tightly by a ghostly woman 
reaching out her window.

00:02:58.818 --> 00:03:02.809
But is her lantern’s hopeful glow 
truly lighting the scene?

00:03:02.809 --> 00:03:04.698
Or is it the jagged lightbulb–

00:03:04.698 --> 00:03:07.865
thought to represent the technologies 
of modern warfare–

00:03:07.865 --> 00:03:11.022
which illuminates her view of 
the chaos below?

00:03:11.022 --> 00:03:13.814
From the coffin-like confines
of her window,

00:03:13.814 --> 00:03:17.324
her arm guides the viewer back 
into the fray,

00:03:17.324 --> 00:03:20.344
to perhaps the most controversial
symbols of all–

00:03:20.344 --> 00:03:24.286
two ghostly animals caught 
in the destruction.

00:03:24.286 --> 00:03:29.106
Does the screaming horse embody the
threat of Franco’s military nationalism;

00:03:29.106 --> 00:03:33.645
or does the spike running through 
its body convey its victimhood?

00:03:33.645 --> 00:03:36.771
Does the white bull represent Spain,

00:03:36.771 --> 00:03:40.971
the country of matadors and a common 
theme in Picasso’s work–

00:03:40.971 --> 00:03:45.362
or does it stand for the 
brutality of war?

00:03:45.362 --> 00:03:49.954
In this scene of strife, these animals 
raise more questions than answers.

00:03:49.954 --> 00:03:52.771
And additional elements hidden 
throughout the frame

00:03:52.771 --> 00:03:56.518
offer even more secrets for 
close observers.

00:03:56.518 --> 00:04:01.701
At the top of the canvas flashes a bird 
desperate to escape the carnage.

00:04:01.701 --> 00:04:05.955
And the abundance of animals on display 
may hint at the bombing’s date–

00:04:05.955 --> 00:04:08.359
a market day which flooded the streets

00:04:08.359 --> 00:04:13.422
with villagers, animals, and 
other potential causalities.

00:04:13.422 --> 00:04:15.566
Like the bombing of Guernica itself,

00:04:15.566 --> 00:04:18.557
Picasso’s painting is dense 
with destruction.

00:04:18.557 --> 00:04:23.778
But hidden beneath this supposed chaos,
are carefully crafted scenes and symbols,

00:04:23.778 --> 00:04:28.270
carrying out the painting’s multifaceted 
attack on fascism.

00:04:28.270 --> 00:04:30.244
Decades after its creation,

00:04:30.244 --> 00:04:35.129
"Guernica" retains its power to shock 
viewers and ignite debate,

00:04:35.129 --> 00:04:39.203
and is often referenced at anti-war 
gatherings around the world.

00:04:39.203 --> 00:04:44.540
Hundred of viewers have grappled with 
its harsh imagery, shattering symbolism

00:04:44.540 --> 00:04:47.340
and complex political messaging.

00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:51.157
But even without a close understanding 
of it’s complicated subtext,

00:04:51.157 --> 00:04:58.147
Picasso’s work remains a searing reminder 
of the true casualties of violence.
