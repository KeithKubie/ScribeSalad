00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:29.670
learned from that crisis that you have
 

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:35.540

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:38.700
and not compromise and we didn't we were

newspaper that had published some
 

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:51.920

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:51.930
cartoons but I think that would be a
 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:53.810
cartoons but I think that would be a
slippery slope

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:53.820
slippery slope
 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:57.939
slippery slope

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:26.210
to compromise in that basic principle
 

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:29.660

then you will gradually undermine your
 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:34.819
then you will gradually undermine your
free society and democracy of course in

00:01:34.819 --> 00:01:34.829
free society and democracy of course in
 

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:37.249
free society and democracy of course in
any democracy

00:01:37.249 --> 00:01:37.259
any democracy
 

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:41.289
any democracy
you should also respect a freedom of

00:01:41.289 --> 00:01:41.299
you should also respect a freedom of
 

00:01:41.299 --> 00:01:47.780
you should also respect a freedom of
religion obviously but it is a basic

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:47.790
religion obviously but it is a basic
 

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:52.370
religion obviously but it is a basic
feature of any democracy that you are

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:52.380
feature of any democracy that you are
 

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:55.609
feature of any democracy that you are
allowed to have a free and also critical

00:01:55.609 --> 00:01:55.619
allowed to have a free and also critical
 

00:01:55.619 --> 00:01:58.990
allowed to have a free and also critical
debate about all issues including

00:01:58.990 --> 00:01:59.000
debate about all issues including
 

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:02.050
debate about all issues including
religion so that's the lesson I took

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:02.060
religion so that's the lesson I took
 

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:04.550
religion so that's the lesson I took
from that crisis

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:04.560
from that crisis
 

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:09.830
from that crisis

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:09.840
I think people broadly accept that we
 

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:13.170
I think people broadly accept that we
have to stand up

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:13.180
have to stand up
 

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:16.410
have to stand up
for these basic principles and the

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:16.420
for these basic principles and the
 

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:18.119
for these basic principles and the
Danish government did at that time

00:02:18.119 --> 00:02:18.129
Danish government did at that time
 

00:02:18.129 --> 00:02:22.620
Danish government did at that time
though it was a very challenging time
