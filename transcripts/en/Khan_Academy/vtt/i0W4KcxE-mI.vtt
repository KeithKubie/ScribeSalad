00:00:00.910 --> 00:00:03.120
We're on problem 79.

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:06.360
A small business owner must hire
seasonal workers as the

00:00:06.360 --> 00:00:07.760
need arises.

00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:09.950
The following list shows the
number of employees hired

00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:11.600
monthly for a five-month
period.

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:14.090
OK, so we hired 4 in the first
month, 13 in the second

00:00:14.090 --> 00:00:15.110
month and so on.

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:18.480
If the mean of these data--
remember, data is plural.

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:21.520
I always say this data, but if
they correctly say if the mean

00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:24.210
of these data is approximately
7.

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:25.710
So the mean is the
average, right?

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:27.640
So they're saying the average
of these numbers is 7.

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:28.270
Fair enough.

00:00:28.270 --> 00:00:31.070
If you add all of these up and
divide by 5, you'll get

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:32.290
approximately 7.

00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:34.190
What is the population standard

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:36.580
deviation for these data?

00:00:36.580 --> 00:00:41.780
So, with population-- I'll make
a statistical playlist

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:43.020
one day where I talk about
the difference between a

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:44.990
population, standard deviation,
and a sample

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:46.320
standard deviation
and all that.

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:49.880
But the population standard
deviation, just you have an

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:54.890
intuition, it's a measure of,
on average, how far are each

00:00:54.890 --> 00:00:56.300
of these numbers
from the mean?

00:00:56.300 --> 00:00:58.940
And it's not exactly the average
of how far they are

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:00.640
from the mean, but I'll show
you that in a second.

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:04.410
It's actually the square root of
the average of the squared

00:01:04.410 --> 00:01:06.970
distances of how far each of
these are from the median.

00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:09.310
And that might sound crazy for
a second, but when you

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:12.220
actually work it all out
the math isn't too bad.

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:14.250
So what we'll do first is
figure out the variance.

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:20.960
That's the notation
for the variance.

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:22.820
And the standard deviation
actually is just the square

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:23.870
root of this.

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:25.880
So if you have the variance,
it's very easy to figure out

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:27.410
the standard deviation.

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:31.090
But the variance-- and just to
give you the intuition-- it's

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:37.940
equal to the average
of the squared

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:44.070
distances from the mean.

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:50.730
So essentially I say, OK
how far is 4 from 7?

00:01:50.730 --> 00:01:51.510
Oh it's 3 away.

00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:52.206
And I square it.

00:01:52.206 --> 00:01:54.410
I say, OK, the squared
distance is 9.

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:56.620
The squared distance here,
let me figure it out.

00:01:56.620 --> 00:02:00.040
So let's actually
write them down.

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:01.240
Let me actually calculate it.

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:02.910
So I'll do it here.

00:02:02.910 --> 00:02:06.790
4 minus 7 is minus 3.

00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:09.220
If I were to square
that, I'd get 9.

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:13.520
So the square of the distance
from 4 to 7 is 9.

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:15.280
So that's a squared distance.

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:18.750
So the squared distance
from 13 to 7.

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:19.820
See, they're 6 apart.

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:21.040
You square them.

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:23.610
And because we're squaring it
doesn't matter if we do 7

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:25.100
minus 12 or 13 minus 7.

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:27.360
Because a negative times a
negative is a positive.

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:28.870
Anyway 13 minus 7 is 6.

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:31.760
That squared is 36.

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:34.930
Then I have 5 minus 7.

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:38.960
That's minus 2 squared
is equal to 4.

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:42.050
Then I have 6 minus 7.

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:43.410
That's negative 1.

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:44.930
Squared is equal to 1.

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:47.800
And then I have 9 minus 7.

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:48.520
That's 2.

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:50.330
Squared is equal to 4.

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:53.950
So the 9 is the square of
how far 4 is from 7.

00:02:53.950 --> 00:02:56.630
36 is a square of how
far 13 is from 7.

00:02:56.630 --> 00:03:01.020
So each of these are the squared
distances of each the

00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:02.600
data points from the mean.

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:04.450
That's where we got
the 7 from, the

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:06.610
average of these numbers.

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:08.500
Now, we said the variance
is the average

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:09.720
of the squared distances.

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:12.210
So it's just the average
of these five numbers.

00:03:12.210 --> 00:03:13.580
So what's the average of
these five numbers?

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:17.600
It's going to be 9
plus 36 is 45.

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:18.790
Plus 4 is 49.

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:19.900
Plus 1 is 50.

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:22.270
Plus 1 is 54.

00:03:22.270 --> 00:03:27.300
So it's going to be 54 divided
by, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.

00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:28.570
Divided by 5.

00:03:28.570 --> 00:03:30.610
So the variance is equal
to the average

00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:32.960
of the squared distances.

00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:33.710
And that's-- what?

00:03:33.710 --> 00:03:38.870
10 and 4/5 is equal to 10.8.

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:40.720
So that's the variance.

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:42.160
They don't want the variance.

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:43.260
They don't want the population
variance.

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:45.490
They want the population
standard deviation.

00:03:45.490 --> 00:03:47.320
Well that's just the square
of the variance.

00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:48.990
And you can see, since you're
taking the square of the

00:03:48.990 --> 00:03:52.090
square distances, it kind of
becomes close to the average

00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:53.060
of the real distances.

00:03:53.060 --> 00:03:54.690
But it's actually not that
and I don't want to

00:03:54.690 --> 00:03:56.020
confuse you right now.

00:03:56.020 --> 00:03:58.130
For the sake of this problem,
let's just take the square

00:03:58.130 --> 00:03:58.580
root of this.

00:03:58.580 --> 00:04:01.310
So the standard deviation
is just equal to the

00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:02.640
square root of the.

00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:07.250
Variance Which is equal to
the square root of 10.8.

00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:08.560
And what is that?

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:10.420
Let's see, 3 squared is 9.

00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:11.980
4 squared is 16.

00:04:11.980 --> 00:04:14.830
So the square root of 10.8 is
going to be pretty close to 3.

00:04:14.830 --> 00:04:17.160
Between 3 and 4 but
a lot closer to 3.

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:18.779
And if we look at all the
choices, the only one that

00:04:18.779 --> 00:04:20.500
even comes close is this one.

00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:22.050
I think if you actually found
the square root it's actually

00:04:22.050 --> 00:04:25.180
very close to 3.3.

00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:26.430
Next problem.

00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:32.470
James found the mean and
standard deviation of the set

00:04:32.470 --> 00:04:33.840
of numbers given above.

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:35.960
If he adds 5 to each number,
which of the

00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:37.380
following will result?

00:04:37.380 --> 00:04:37.640
All right.

00:04:37.640 --> 00:04:38.370
If you add 5.

00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:40.610
The mean will be multiplied
by 5.

00:04:40.610 --> 00:04:41.090
No, no, no.

00:04:41.090 --> 00:04:41.810
That's not right.

00:04:41.810 --> 00:04:44.170
Because if you add 5 to each
of these numbers, the mean

00:04:44.170 --> 00:04:46.990
will just become 5 bigger.

00:04:46.990 --> 00:04:48.400
You're kind of just
shifting over the

00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:50.030
center to some degree.

00:04:50.030 --> 00:04:52.250
Where you're measuring the
center by the average over 5.

00:04:52.250 --> 00:04:55.390
Actually I could even
show it to you.

00:04:55.390 --> 00:05:00.110
If I said 3 plus 5, and I'm
going to add that to 6 plus 5

00:05:00.110 --> 00:05:02.320
plus 2 plus 5.

00:05:02.320 --> 00:05:05.010
I'm adding 5 to every number.

00:05:05.010 --> 00:05:06.400
Plus 2 plus 5.

00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:08.890
Plus 1 plus 5.

00:05:08.890 --> 00:05:11.430
Plus 7 plus 5.

00:05:11.430 --> 00:05:14.440
Plus 5 plus 5.

00:05:14.440 --> 00:05:18.800
All of that divided
by-- there's, 1,

00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:22.590
2, 3, 4, 5, 6 numbers.

00:05:22.590 --> 00:05:26.780
All of that divided by 6.

00:05:26.780 --> 00:05:31.080
This is the same thing as-- let
me write this-- if we, we

00:05:31.080 --> 00:05:32.010
can get rid of parentheses.

00:05:32.010 --> 00:05:33.300
All we're doing is adding.

00:05:33.300 --> 00:05:37.350
So that's the same thing
as 3 plus 6 plus 2 plus

00:05:37.350 --> 00:05:39.780
1 plus 7 plus 5.

00:05:39.780 --> 00:05:41.640
I just took the first terms
in each of these.

00:05:45.160 --> 00:05:46.380
Plus-- how many 5s do we have?

00:05:46.380 --> 00:05:49.580
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.

00:05:49.580 --> 00:05:52.090
Plus 6 times 5.

00:05:52.090 --> 00:05:55.540
All of that over 6.

00:05:55.540 --> 00:06:02.470
Well, this is going to be equal
to 3 plus 6 plus 2 plus

00:06:02.470 --> 00:06:06.520
1 plus 7 plus 5, over 6.

00:06:06.520 --> 00:06:08.790
Let me scroll down
a little bit.

00:06:08.790 --> 00:06:12.440
Plus-- what's 6 times
5 divided by 6?

00:06:12.440 --> 00:06:14.610
Well that's just 5.

00:06:14.610 --> 00:06:17.600
So this is the average of the
original set of numbers.

00:06:17.600 --> 00:06:20.860
And now, when you add 5 to all
of them, the average of all of

00:06:20.860 --> 00:06:22.730
them combined is just going
to be the original

00:06:22.730 --> 00:06:24.330
average plus 5.

00:06:24.330 --> 00:06:26.810
So you're just shifting the
average to the right.

00:06:26.810 --> 00:06:27.590
So this is not right.

00:06:27.590 --> 00:06:29.250
You're not multiplying
the mean by 5.

00:06:29.250 --> 00:06:30.790
You're just adding
5 to the mean.

00:06:30.790 --> 00:06:32.160
That's not right.

00:06:32.160 --> 00:06:34.590
The standard deviation
will increase by 5.

00:06:34.590 --> 00:06:36.040
Well, in the last video you
saw that the standard

00:06:36.040 --> 00:06:38.300
deviation is the square
root of the variance.

00:06:38.300 --> 00:06:42.130
But both of them are a measure
of the average distance of the

00:06:42.130 --> 00:06:46.350
numbers from the mean,
or from the average.

00:06:46.350 --> 00:06:49.720
So even if you shift everything
by 5-- the mean

00:06:49.720 --> 00:06:53.680
shifts by 5, all the numbers
shift by 5-- their distances

00:06:53.680 --> 00:06:55.580
from the mean aren't going
to change, actually.

00:06:55.580 --> 00:06:57.760
The standard deviation actually
won't change.

00:06:57.760 --> 00:06:58.530
So this isn't right.

00:06:58.530 --> 00:07:00.900
The standard deviation
won't increase by 5.

00:07:00.900 --> 00:07:02.500
These numbers aren't going
to become further

00:07:02.500 --> 00:07:04.270
away from the average.

00:07:04.270 --> 00:07:06.260
So that's not right.

00:07:06.260 --> 00:07:07.420
The mean will not change.

00:07:07.420 --> 00:07:07.870
Well, no.

00:07:07.870 --> 00:07:09.400
We know that the mean
will change.

00:07:09.400 --> 00:07:10.400
I just showed you that
the mean will

00:07:10.400 --> 00:07:12.620
actually increase by 5.

00:07:12.620 --> 00:07:15.220
When all the numbers have
increased by 5.

00:07:15.220 --> 00:07:16.020
That's not right.

00:07:16.020 --> 00:07:17.730
So we already know that D
is probably the answer,

00:07:17.730 --> 00:07:19.540
but let's make sure.

00:07:19.540 --> 00:07:21.090
The standard deviation
will not change.

00:07:21.090 --> 00:07:22.140
Right.

00:07:22.140 --> 00:07:26.040
In general, the average
dispersion, or how far on

00:07:26.040 --> 00:07:28.180
average the numbers are away
from the mean, won't change.

00:07:28.180 --> 00:07:30.650
All the numbers are going to
increase by 5 and the mean is

00:07:30.650 --> 00:07:31.900
going to increase by 5.

00:07:31.900 --> 00:07:35.090
So how far the numbers are from
the mean, their variance

00:07:35.090 --> 00:07:35.880
won't change.

00:07:35.880 --> 00:07:37.250
The square of their distances
won't change.

00:07:37.250 --> 00:07:39.730
And if the variance doesn't
change, then
