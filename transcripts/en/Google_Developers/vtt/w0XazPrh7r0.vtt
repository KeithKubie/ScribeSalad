SCOTT JENSON: I'm
on the Chrome team.

00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:07.555
I've been at Google--
I joined in 2005.

00:00:07.555 --> 00:00:08.680
I was there for many years.

00:00:08.680 --> 00:00:09.260
I left.

00:00:09.260 --> 00:00:11.020
I actually came
back two years ago

00:00:11.020 --> 00:00:13.310
to specifically work on
this particular project.

00:00:13.310 --> 00:00:15.230
I'm quite interested in it.

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:18.810
And it all came from something
I noticed a couple years ago,

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:21.540
which is the fact that we have
more and more smart devices

00:00:21.540 --> 00:00:23.270
that we're all seeing around.

00:00:23.270 --> 00:00:26.490
And each one of them
has their own smart app.

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:28.740
And that's, of course,
totally understandable.

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:31.580
That's how this kind of
thing has to work right now.

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:33.512
But if we believe in
Moore's law at all,

00:00:33.512 --> 00:00:34.720
where are we going with this?

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:36.070
And what's going to
happen in six months?

00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:37.736
And what's going to
happen in 12 months?

00:00:37.736 --> 00:00:40.411
And are we really going to
have smart apps for absolutely

00:00:40.411 --> 00:00:40.910
everything?

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:43.870
And this is especially true
in the public space, where

00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:46.442
you want to use something
in a mall or an airport,

00:00:46.442 --> 00:00:48.900
where you're not going to be
installing the vending machine

00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:50.440
app as you walk past it.

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:52.410
So for those type of
lightweight situations,

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:54.420
how can we make this happen?

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:57.730
Because, to a certain extent,
the super power of the web

00:00:57.730 --> 00:01:00.240
is the fact that it has
interaction on demand.

00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:02.740
You can literally
go to any experience

00:01:02.740 --> 00:01:04.590
on the planet with just a tap.

00:01:04.590 --> 00:01:05.750
It's just a tap away.

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:09.100
And I think that's kind
of useful for the internet

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:10.880
of things and smart devices.

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:13.110
So how can we make that happen?

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:15.760
Because, over the
last, say, 30 years,

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:17.690
we've gotten very
excited by the DOM--

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:20.040
the Document Object
Model of the web.

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:22.690
And we've spent all of our
energy doing really cool things

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:24.160
inside of that box.

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:25.970
There's no question
that's really powerful,

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:28.345
but we've hardly done anything
at all for this little box

00:01:28.345 --> 00:01:29.972
at the top, this URL bar.

00:01:29.972 --> 00:01:31.180
We have to type something in.

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:32.120
I mean, if we want
to go anywhere, we've

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:34.372
got to kind of dub, dub,
dub, dub, you know, CNN.com.

00:01:34.372 --> 00:01:36.020
And that's kind of silly.

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:39.100
We've taken the most amazing
rendering engine on the planet,

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:41.540
and we've slapped a damn DOS
prompt on top of it, which

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:43.750
just seems really weird.

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:47.230
It's like, really, why can't
the web on mobile start

00:01:47.230 --> 00:01:49.920
to take advantage of the
sensors that have been there

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:51.060
for an awful long time.

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:54.160
So the Chrome team
basically feels that the web

00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:55.850
needs a discovery service.

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:58.250
Why must you be on
your mobile phone,

00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:00.156
and if you want to
go to a website,

00:02:00.156 --> 00:02:01.780
you actually have to
type something in.

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:04.250
That's just right
out of the 1980s.

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:05.860
So that really seems
kind of strange.

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:07.540
So the idea would
be is, let's say

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:09.820
there's three things in the
environment-- a bus stop,

00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:11.730
a parking meter, and
a vending machine--

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:14.700
and you wanted to actually
interact with one of them.

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:16.050
What would you have to do?

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:19.119
Well, if each one is
broadcasting a URL--

00:02:19.119 --> 00:02:21.410
and we'd like to imagine
there's many technologies that

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:23.243
can do this, but let's,
just for the moment,

00:02:23.243 --> 00:02:25.790
stick with Bluetooth
Low Energy--

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:27.187
and it was finding that beacon.

00:02:27.187 --> 00:02:29.520
And you were to walk into
that space, what would happen?

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:31.420
Now, we could just
take the URLs and just

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:34.630
give you a list of them, but--
and URLs are really important

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:36.400
for transparency in
domains and so forth,

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:37.560
but it's not quite enough.

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:39.143
What you'd like to
be able to have is,

00:02:39.143 --> 00:02:41.470
like, a title, and
a little snippet,

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:44.280
and maybe a little icon to
explain what you're picking.

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:45.967
And then, once you
actually got that,

00:02:45.967 --> 00:02:48.300
you would then, of course,
just take you to the website.

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:49.570
It's really that lightweight.

00:02:49.570 --> 00:02:52.990
The idea is to discover,
and show, and go

00:02:52.990 --> 00:02:56.250
as quickly as you possibly can.

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:58.320
And how this would
work is, right now,

00:02:58.320 --> 00:02:59.910
for the v1 version
that we're doing,

00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:01.960
is it's just using
Bluetooth Low Energy, which

00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:03.960
is broadcasting
in the advertising

00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:05.200
packet of the beacon.

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:08.130
This is a standard part
of Bluetooth Low Energy.

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:10.690
It just broadcasts a URL
in the advertising packet

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:12.057
over, and over, and over again.

00:03:12.057 --> 00:03:13.640
And then what would
happen, of course,

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:15.310
is that your phone would have
a simple scanner that would

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:16.690
say, "I know what that is.

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:17.810
I can show that to you."

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:20.390
And then give a little
list to the user.

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:22.170
It's really just that simple.

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:24.600
It's a very tiny
bit of technology

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:26.110
that we're trying to do here.

00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:28.270
And that's essentially
all that The Physical Web

00:03:28.270 --> 00:03:31.410
is, is this bridge between
physical and the web.

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:33.710
So, you walk up to
a parking meter,

00:03:33.710 --> 00:03:35.480
it's broadcasting the URL.

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:38.650
You can then kind of
see it, and in you go.

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:41.680
But what people, I don't
think, appreciate sometimes

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:42.936
is how simple this idea is.

00:03:42.936 --> 00:03:44.310
We're not really
asking for much.

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:46.420
We just want things to
have their own web pages.

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:48.170
But it's just a web page.

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:51.640
And so people are so used
to having a big portal

00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:53.390
that millions of people
go to, as opposed

00:03:53.390 --> 00:03:55.840
to a web page for every device.

00:03:55.840 --> 00:03:58.094
It's kind of flipping the
whole problem on its head.

00:03:58.094 --> 00:03:59.760
And the idea is that
you would literally

00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:01.720
be able to walk up
and use anything--

00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:03.720
whether it would be a
vending machine, a parking

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:05.590
meter, a movie poster.

00:04:05.590 --> 00:04:08.350
It could even be a lost dog
collar, if you wanted it to be.

00:04:08.350 --> 00:04:10.870
Every device has this
virtual note card

00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:13.220
of just more information.

00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:14.910
But the critical
thing is that we've so

00:04:14.910 --> 00:04:17.649
imprinted upon existing
beacon solutions

00:04:17.649 --> 00:04:20.641
that we assume that this
must beep in your pocket,

00:04:20.641 --> 00:04:22.140
this must be some
kind of vibration.

00:04:22.140 --> 00:04:25.330
And anybody who remembers
Bluetooth Classic

00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:28.130
in the 1990s, that had
Bluetooth messaging,

00:04:28.130 --> 00:04:30.095
realizes that that
was a really bad idea.

00:04:30.095 --> 00:04:31.636
Because the spammers
got a hold of it

00:04:31.636 --> 00:04:33.260
and ruined it for everybody.

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:34.890
We can't have this
thing vibrate,

00:04:34.890 --> 00:04:36.570
because it's a universal system.

00:04:36.570 --> 00:04:38.310
You'd walk into a mall, and
your phone would jump out

00:04:38.310 --> 00:04:39.976
of your pocket, it
would be so, kind of,

00:04:39.976 --> 00:04:41.850
on fire with notifications.

00:04:41.850 --> 00:04:44.240
So this can only
work if the user

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:47.680
pulls her phone out and says,
show me the things around.

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:50.580
We have to respect the
user's attention, here,

00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:52.080
and only do it when
they ask for it.

00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:55.260
It's a big difference
from previous models.

00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:57.030
So the idea is pretty
simple, in the sense

00:04:57.030 --> 00:04:59.730
that you just have a device
that broadcasts a URL

00:04:59.730 --> 00:05:00.990
and it takes you to the cloud.

00:05:00.990 --> 00:05:01.940
That's really it.

00:05:01.940 --> 00:05:04.650
But I always get two questions,
right away, right off the bat.

00:05:04.650 --> 00:05:06.670
So I'll just save you
guys, because this is only

00:05:06.670 --> 00:05:09.140
going to be 15 minutes, and I
want 15 minutes of questions.

00:05:09.140 --> 00:05:10.598
The first question
I always get is,

00:05:10.598 --> 00:05:12.770
well, isn't this just
a QR code, come on?

00:05:12.770 --> 00:05:15.680
I'm like, well,
technically, yes.

00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:16.687
It's a QR code.

00:05:16.687 --> 00:05:18.770
I like to think of it as
a really awesome QR code.

00:05:18.770 --> 00:05:20.870
It's a little bit different,
because the intention,

00:05:20.870 --> 00:05:22.328
of course, of the
QR code, you have

00:05:22.328 --> 00:05:24.490
to see one thing at a
time, and you actually

00:05:24.490 --> 00:05:26.430
have to get close and do that.

00:05:26.430 --> 00:05:29.870
Whereas here, you can see
a dozen-- multiple dozens--

00:05:29.870 --> 00:05:31.150
of things at the same time.

00:05:31.150 --> 00:05:33.860
Or, more importantly, instead
of being on top of the object,

00:05:33.860 --> 00:05:36.650
it can literally
be 50 meters away.

00:05:36.650 --> 00:05:38.560
So it's a whole
different usage case.

00:05:38.560 --> 00:05:42.520
Also, QR codes are popular
in a couple countries,

00:05:42.520 --> 00:05:45.010
but they tend to be on used
things-- like receipts,

00:05:45.010 --> 00:05:47.330
and advertising in
magazines, or posters.

00:05:47.330 --> 00:05:49.510
There's a very limited use
case for where they work.

00:05:49.510 --> 00:05:52.990
You would not put a QR code
on a light bulb, or a toaster,

00:05:52.990 --> 00:05:54.100
or a refrigerator.

00:05:54.100 --> 00:05:56.009
It just doesn't make sense.

00:05:56.009 --> 00:05:57.550
The other question
I get all the time

00:05:57.550 --> 00:05:59.140
is, won't this generate spam?

00:05:59.140 --> 00:06:01.297
If this is the web, and
anybody can take a URL,

00:06:01.297 --> 00:06:02.880
and anybody can slap
it over anywhere,

00:06:02.880 --> 00:06:04.450
it's going to be just chaos.

00:06:04.450 --> 00:06:06.680
And I'm like, well,
it's kind of the web.

00:06:06.680 --> 00:06:08.150
And the web is kind of chaotic.

00:06:08.150 --> 00:06:10.690
But we have a way of
dealing with this.

00:06:10.690 --> 00:06:12.960
We basically grab
all URLs around you,

00:06:12.960 --> 00:06:17.420
and we don't show them directly
to the user for two reasons.

00:06:17.420 --> 00:06:20.107
One is, we don't want to
contact each website directly.

00:06:20.107 --> 00:06:21.440
The user could be fingerprinted.

00:06:21.440 --> 00:06:22.800
That would be a leak of privacy.

00:06:22.800 --> 00:06:24.480
So we have to protect the user.

00:06:24.480 --> 00:06:26.300
And we put them all
through a proxy.

00:06:26.300 --> 00:06:29.170
And the proxy, then, can then
contact on the user's behalf,

00:06:29.170 --> 00:06:30.470
which protects them.

00:06:30.470 --> 00:06:32.332
But it also allows us
to run a spam filter

00:06:32.332 --> 00:06:34.290
on it and a phishing
filter and kind of get rid

00:06:34.290 --> 00:06:35.470
of the low-hanging fruit.

00:06:35.470 --> 00:06:37.420
Also, right now,
we are encouraging

00:06:37.420 --> 00:06:41.030
only HTTPS domains,
which vastly gets rid

00:06:41.030 --> 00:06:43.310
of a lot of the
low-hanging fruit, as well.

00:06:43.310 --> 00:06:46.080
So it helps, effectively,
to kind of train

00:06:46.080 --> 00:06:48.360
the chaos a little bit.

00:06:48.360 --> 00:06:51.030
We are built on
top of Eddystone.

00:06:51.030 --> 00:06:52.790
Eddystone is the
underlying beacon format

00:06:52.790 --> 00:06:56.250
you've probably heard 75
times in the last two days.

00:06:56.250 --> 00:06:59.330
And there's three classic
formats-- the UID,

00:06:59.330 --> 00:07:01.210
the telemetry, and the URL.

00:07:01.210 --> 00:07:03.570
We're using the URL packet.

00:07:03.570 --> 00:07:05.192
And we just pack a URL inside.

00:07:05.192 --> 00:07:06.650
We have a simple
compression scheme

00:07:06.650 --> 00:07:09.420
to get rid of some of
the obvious things,

00:07:09.420 --> 00:07:12.690
like HTTPS://www.

00:07:12.690 --> 00:07:13.960
is one byte.

00:07:13.960 --> 00:07:16.427
It's a form of just
simple encoding.

00:07:16.427 --> 00:07:18.010
But that's what we're
built on top of.

00:07:18.010 --> 00:07:20.360
We are the scanner on
top of Eddystone URL.

00:07:20.360 --> 00:07:22.420
So what we're
trying to create is,

00:07:22.420 --> 00:07:24.100
effectively, two
clouds-- a cloud

00:07:24.100 --> 00:07:27.230
of devices that are
broadcasting URLs in a very

00:07:27.230 --> 00:07:29.700
standard format--
so everybody is

00:07:29.700 --> 00:07:31.410
broadcasting URLs
in the same way--

00:07:31.410 --> 00:07:33.957
and then a whole
range of scanners.

00:07:33.957 --> 00:07:35.540
Now, right now, there
are no scanners.

00:07:35.540 --> 00:07:37.040
It's just us, and
we're building it.

00:07:37.040 --> 00:07:39.520
But that's why we're
doing this open source.

00:07:39.520 --> 00:07:41.637
I love coming back to
Google to the Chrome team,

00:07:41.637 --> 00:07:43.220
because the Chrome
team is just filled

00:07:43.220 --> 00:07:44.860
with Boy Scouts,
who just want to do

00:07:44.860 --> 00:07:46.170
the right thing for the web.

00:07:46.170 --> 00:07:47.910
And so the beacons
code is open source,

00:07:47.910 --> 00:07:50.450
the scanner is open source,
the proxy is open source.

00:07:50.450 --> 00:07:54.232
We want there to be lots
and lots of people scanning

00:07:54.232 --> 00:07:55.440
and showing The Physical Web.

00:07:55.440 --> 00:07:58.320
It's not our job
to be our product.

00:07:58.320 --> 00:08:01.350
We're just kind of kick-starting
this new open web format.

00:08:01.350 --> 00:08:03.850
So we will be the first one we
hope will get people excited.

00:08:03.850 --> 00:08:05.920
But already there are two
or three other companies

00:08:05.920 --> 00:08:07.003
making their own scanners.

00:08:07.003 --> 00:08:09.170
And we're, like, super
excited about this happening.

00:08:09.170 --> 00:08:10.419
So let me give you an example.

00:08:10.419 --> 00:08:11.490
I've talked an awful lot.

00:08:11.490 --> 00:08:13.960
Here's a couple examples of
products that you could build.

00:08:13.960 --> 00:08:17.420
So what we're doing right now
is showing a Happy Meal toy.

00:08:17.420 --> 00:08:21.260
And it is using The Physical
Web to get to the web page.

00:08:21.260 --> 00:08:24.340
But, because there's a
new W3C standard that

00:08:24.340 --> 00:08:26.870
uses JavaScript to
speak Bluetooth,

00:08:26.870 --> 00:08:29.730
it allows you to actually
connect to the toy

00:08:29.730 --> 00:08:31.230
and control it directly.

00:08:31.230 --> 00:08:32.820
So here's how it happens.

00:08:32.820 --> 00:08:35.419
We're using The
Physical Web to find it.

00:08:35.419 --> 00:08:38.000
And there we see, right
there, Tuba the Turtle.

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:38.532
We click it.

00:08:38.532 --> 00:08:39.740
Now The Physical Web is done.

00:08:39.740 --> 00:08:41.929
We're now classic
web at this point.

00:08:41.929 --> 00:08:43.450
It shows you the web page.

00:08:43.450 --> 00:08:46.080
Now you can actually control
it by picking various things.

00:08:46.080 --> 00:08:48.602
You make it happy,
or silly, or grumpy.

00:08:48.602 --> 00:08:50.060
You kind of choose
its personality.

00:08:50.060 --> 00:08:50.890
And the color changes.

00:08:50.890 --> 00:08:53.056
And you can't tell, but
it's vibrating and changing.

00:08:53.056 --> 00:08:54.670
Or you can change
the actual color.

00:08:54.670 --> 00:08:55.560
And the whole idea
is that you're

00:08:55.560 --> 00:08:57.220
kind of configuring
this for your child.

00:08:57.220 --> 00:08:59.290
You put the phone away, and now
it's got its own personality.

00:08:59.290 --> 00:09:01.248
You turn it upside down,
and it gets all grumpy

00:09:01.248 --> 00:09:02.030
and it vibrates.

00:09:02.030 --> 00:09:04.352
We had way too much
fun building this.

00:09:04.352 --> 00:09:06.810
We actually had to stop, because
we weren't really building

00:09:06.810 --> 00:09:07.851
The Physical Web anymore.

00:09:07.851 --> 00:09:09.670
We were building a toy.

00:09:09.670 --> 00:09:13.699
But it shows you how fun it is
to build this kind of stuff.

00:09:13.699 --> 00:09:15.490
And this could be built
for a couple bucks.

00:09:15.490 --> 00:09:17.690
It would be really
inexpensive to do.

00:09:17.690 --> 00:09:20.030
And it's just
using a device that

00:09:20.030 --> 00:09:22.030
has Bluetooth and a
couple-- a little [? gaps ?]

00:09:22.030 --> 00:09:26.550
service to it-- no internet
connectivity of any kind.

00:09:26.550 --> 00:09:29.220
Now this is probably our
most aggressive concept,

00:09:29.220 --> 00:09:31.390
because it uses all
the latest cool stuff.

00:09:31.390 --> 00:09:34.680
We've got a product sending
a Bluetooth beacon to me.

00:09:34.680 --> 00:09:37.000
I'm going to the web, and
I'm getting a web page

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:39.750
with this new web Bluetooth
JavaScript library-- which

00:09:39.750 --> 00:09:42.250
is, by the way, a W3C standard.

00:09:42.250 --> 00:09:44.620
And then you can then talk
right back to the device.

00:09:44.620 --> 00:09:48.180
What people like about it is
that there's no cloud here.

00:09:48.180 --> 00:09:50.434
The device is just
talking directly to me.

00:09:50.434 --> 00:09:52.100
I need the cloud to
get to the web page,

00:09:52.100 --> 00:09:55.940
but that's just a one
time shot to get that.

00:09:55.940 --> 00:09:58.110
Now, the flip side, the
completely different way

00:09:58.110 --> 00:10:02.280
of thinking about this is to do
what we call Classic Web, which

00:10:02.280 --> 00:10:04.280
is imagine, say, for
example, a bus stop that's

00:10:04.280 --> 00:10:05.530
broadcasting a URL.

00:10:05.530 --> 00:10:08.440
And I go to the cloud,
and I just get a web page.

00:10:08.440 --> 00:10:10.220
That is not a smart bus stop.

00:10:10.220 --> 00:10:12.900
It's a concrete pole,
full of concrete,

00:10:12.900 --> 00:10:15.210
it just simply just gives
me some information.

00:10:15.210 --> 00:10:17.150
Simple, it's
lightweight, and we feel

00:10:17.150 --> 00:10:20.110
like this unlocks all sorts
of really interesting things

00:10:20.110 --> 00:10:22.360
that you can do.

00:10:22.360 --> 00:10:24.907
But this is what I mean by
having this virtual note card.

00:10:24.907 --> 00:10:26.990
Whether it's a movie poster
or anything like that,

00:10:26.990 --> 00:10:29.940
it can be really interesting.

00:10:29.940 --> 00:10:33.770
But what we also discovered
was kind of almost a surprise--

00:10:33.770 --> 00:10:35.880
that there's so much
going on in the web,

00:10:35.880 --> 00:10:38.250
it's getting so much better.

00:10:38.250 --> 00:10:41.190
It's making us look awesome,
and we don't deserve it at all.

00:10:41.190 --> 00:10:43.460
There's just a lot of
really cool web technologies

00:10:43.460 --> 00:10:44.790
that are coming on top of it.

00:10:44.790 --> 00:10:47.560
So, for example, if you've
heard of Service Worker that's

00:10:47.560 --> 00:10:49.940
coming-- also
another standard-- it

00:10:49.940 --> 00:10:53.020
allows you to sign up for
push notifications, which

00:10:53.020 --> 00:10:56.552
the user opts in to being able
to be beeped at a later time.

00:10:56.552 --> 00:10:58.260
So in this particular
case, I'll show you

00:10:58.260 --> 00:10:59.970
this restaurant buzzer.

00:10:59.970 --> 00:11:02.070
I'll flip over here.

00:11:02.070 --> 00:11:05.140
So you pull down the Manager
and you see Bob's Deli.

00:11:05.140 --> 00:11:06.470
Again, Physical Web done.

00:11:06.470 --> 00:11:07.890
That was, like, four seconds.

00:11:07.890 --> 00:11:09.340
We're now on a web page
that says, "Hey, there's

00:11:09.340 --> 00:11:10.548
eight people in front of you.

00:11:10.548 --> 00:11:11.610
Take a number."

00:11:11.610 --> 00:11:13.660
You can now sign up for
a push notification.

00:11:13.660 --> 00:11:14.620
You turn off the phone.

00:11:14.620 --> 00:11:16.550
You put it in your pocket.

00:11:16.550 --> 00:11:19.590
Then what happens is, it's
your turn in line at the deli.

00:11:19.590 --> 00:11:22.620
It sends you a push
notification, your phone beeps,

00:11:22.620 --> 00:11:24.689
"Bob's Deli," and you go.

00:11:24.689 --> 00:11:26.730
Now, in this case, it did
vibrate in your pocket,

00:11:26.730 --> 00:11:28.000
but you opted in.

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:28.880
You asked for it.

00:11:28.880 --> 00:11:30.180
It's a big difference.

00:11:30.180 --> 00:11:34.090
And, again, The Physical Web is
identical for both the turtle

00:11:34.090 --> 00:11:35.240
and the restaurant.

00:11:35.240 --> 00:11:37.550
It's just the web
made it more awesome

00:11:37.550 --> 00:11:39.820
and did it on top of it.

00:11:39.820 --> 00:11:42.750
And the last one I want to talk
about is Cloud Passthrough.

00:11:42.750 --> 00:11:45.960
And this is maybe more of
a developer difference.

00:11:45.960 --> 00:11:47.062
It's not really the same.

00:11:47.062 --> 00:11:49.020
I mean, from the user
experience point of view,

00:11:49.020 --> 00:11:50.540
you're walking up to a
device and you're using it.

00:11:50.540 --> 00:11:52.700
But it's fun to explore
the plumbing differences.

00:11:52.700 --> 00:11:56.890
In this case, the smart
parking meter sends you a URL.

00:11:56.890 --> 00:11:59.000
You go to the cloud, and
then the cloud actually

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:00.740
talks directly to that device.

00:12:00.740 --> 00:12:02.004
It's just using web sockets.

00:12:02.004 --> 00:12:03.920
It's just pushing
[? it then ?] to the device.

00:12:03.920 --> 00:12:06.209
So here's how this would work.

00:12:06.209 --> 00:12:07.500
Here's a parking meter we made.

00:12:07.500 --> 00:12:09.800
I'm pulling down the
Notification Manager.

00:12:09.800 --> 00:12:12.010
I just see the fact that
it's Pay at Parking right

00:12:12.010 --> 00:12:13.460
in front of me, and I click it.

00:12:13.460 --> 00:12:15.240
Again, Physical Web is done.

00:12:15.240 --> 00:12:17.759
Now at this particular
point, the parking meter

00:12:17.759 --> 00:12:18.550
is on the internet.

00:12:18.550 --> 00:12:20.758
It has its own connectivity,
separate from the phone.

00:12:20.758 --> 00:12:23.085
I go up, up, and
the number goes up.

00:12:23.085 --> 00:12:27.600
I hit Pay, that authorizes it,
and it goes, and we're done.

00:12:27.600 --> 00:12:29.680
Whenever I show this
in San Francisco,

00:12:29.680 --> 00:12:32.504
people just cry a little bit.

00:12:32.504 --> 00:12:34.670
Because, you know, we have
that parking system here,

00:12:34.670 --> 00:12:36.460
and nobody can figure
out how to use it.

00:12:36.460 --> 00:12:38.620
Now, I will admit I
cheated a little bit here.

00:12:38.620 --> 00:12:40.960
Because I had already
used it once before,

00:12:40.960 --> 00:12:43.530
so I knew whatever my
payment system was.

00:12:43.530 --> 00:12:46.130
And people always ask, well,
are you using Google Pay?

00:12:46.130 --> 00:12:47.280
I don't care.

00:12:47.280 --> 00:12:48.340
It's the web.

00:12:48.340 --> 00:12:49.600
Pick your payment system.

00:12:49.600 --> 00:12:51.520
It's just simply whatever web
system that you want to have.

00:12:51.520 --> 00:12:53.660
But, once you had that
in place, it literally

00:12:53.660 --> 00:12:56.820
would be that many
clicks, and you'd be done.

00:12:56.820 --> 00:12:59.220
So I want to stress one
critical point here,

00:12:59.220 --> 00:13:02.270
though, that what we're talking
about with The Physical Web

00:13:02.270 --> 00:13:04.840
is the ability for you to
find the URL on the phone

00:13:04.840 --> 00:13:06.390
and then take you to a web page.

00:13:06.390 --> 00:13:07.660
That's our job.

00:13:07.660 --> 00:13:11.660
It's effectively just a really
awesome QR code side of things.

00:13:11.660 --> 00:13:14.770
Everything else that
you saw was the web.

00:13:14.770 --> 00:13:18.020
I've gotten asked many times,
"Scott, what's your SDK?"

00:13:18.020 --> 00:13:20.790
And I'm like kind of going,
"Well, I don't have one."

00:13:20.790 --> 00:13:22.410
Because, I mean, we don't.

00:13:22.410 --> 00:13:23.690
We just get you to a web page.

00:13:23.690 --> 00:13:25.023
It's up to you to go from there.

00:13:25.023 --> 00:13:26.136
We don't have an SDK.

00:13:26.136 --> 00:13:28.510
It's just simply, you just
take a beacon, and slap it up,

00:13:28.510 --> 00:13:30.790
and you're done.

00:13:30.790 --> 00:13:32.990
So the intention
is that-- and a lot

00:13:32.990 --> 00:13:35.220
of times when I show people
the Cloud Passthrough,

00:13:35.220 --> 00:13:37.090
they're like,
"Yeah, but come on.

00:13:37.090 --> 00:13:38.200
Are you really going
to have a device that's

00:13:38.200 --> 00:13:39.324
connected to the internet?"

00:13:39.324 --> 00:13:41.760
But like, you have heard of
The Internet of Things, right?

00:13:41.760 --> 00:13:43.850
I mean, you can get,
effectively, GSM

00:13:43.850 --> 00:13:47.610
modems now from a company called
Particle that's, like, $39.

00:13:47.610 --> 00:13:49.902
And it has GSM connectivity
and it gets 10,000 messages

00:13:49.902 --> 00:13:50.401
a month.

00:13:50.401 --> 00:13:52.200
I mean, it's not a
big deal now to make

00:13:52.200 --> 00:13:54.957
a device that's connected to
the internet that gets messages.

00:13:54.957 --> 00:13:56.790
So, what I think is
going to be very likely,

00:13:56.790 --> 00:13:59.160
over the next year or
two, is that devices

00:13:59.160 --> 00:14:00.760
will have their connectivity.

00:14:00.760 --> 00:14:02.510
I'll have my connectivity.

00:14:02.510 --> 00:14:03.994
And we'll be in a public space.

00:14:03.994 --> 00:14:05.910
There's no way that we're
on the same network.

00:14:05.910 --> 00:14:07.800
The idea that we're
going to the same subnet

00:14:07.800 --> 00:14:09.759
is totally appropriate
for enterprise and home.

00:14:09.759 --> 00:14:10.758
I'm not saying it isn't.

00:14:10.758 --> 00:14:12.350
But in public spaces,
you're not going

00:14:12.350 --> 00:14:14.590
to be connecting to its
Wi-Fi so you can talk to it.

00:14:14.590 --> 00:14:15.756
That doesn't make any sense.

00:14:15.756 --> 00:14:18.740
You just simply want to a URL
to say, just meet me over here.

00:14:18.740 --> 00:14:20.310
Just, I'll just meet you
over there, and that's fine.

00:14:20.310 --> 00:14:22.000
So it's really meant
to be lightweight

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:25.850
way to kind of rendezvous
kind of in the cloud.

00:14:25.850 --> 00:14:27.734
We also found out that,
as we are playing,

00:14:27.734 --> 00:14:30.150
is, the first thing I built--
I don't know if you guys saw

00:14:30.150 --> 00:14:32.670
this-- but the first thing I did
was I built a vending machine.

00:14:32.670 --> 00:14:33.840
I bought it on Craigslist.

00:14:33.840 --> 00:14:34.964
I carried it in the office.

00:14:34.964 --> 00:14:38.420
I ripped the guts out, put in a
Raspberry Pi, hooked it all up.

00:14:38.420 --> 00:14:39.770
And everybody loved it.

00:14:39.770 --> 00:14:41.980
It's fun to have this kind
of vending machine work.

00:14:41.980 --> 00:14:43.940
But it was quite
clear that we were

00:14:43.940 --> 00:14:47.752
thinking kind of like a
classic "control stuff" model.

00:14:47.752 --> 00:14:48.960
We actually got much smaller.

00:14:48.960 --> 00:14:50.720
It was like this idea
of bus stops I told you,

00:14:50.720 --> 00:14:51.480
or movie posters.

00:14:51.480 --> 00:14:53.130
But these are still
corporate ideas.

00:14:53.130 --> 00:14:54.630
The more we played
with it, the more

00:14:54.630 --> 00:14:58.010
we realized it unlocks all sorts
of really interesting personal,

00:14:58.010 --> 00:14:59.740
consumer use cases.

00:14:59.740 --> 00:15:01.282
So, imagine, for
example, that you're

00:15:01.282 --> 00:15:03.365
giving-- we're actually
writing an extension right

00:15:03.365 --> 00:15:04.240
now for Chrome OS.

00:15:04.240 --> 00:15:06.030
So when you're
presenting Google Slides,

00:15:06.030 --> 00:15:08.960
you're just presenting the URL
to everyone else in the room,

00:15:08.960 --> 00:15:10.717
so they can also
see your slides.

00:15:10.717 --> 00:15:12.800
It's a one-time thing that
happens for 30 minutes,

00:15:12.800 --> 00:15:14.270
and then it's just done.

00:15:14.270 --> 00:15:16.464
Or the fact that you could
put this on a dog collar.

00:15:16.464 --> 00:15:18.630
And, normally, it would
just simply be a dog collar,

00:15:18.630 --> 00:15:19.320
"I'm Sparky.

00:15:19.320 --> 00:15:19.980
Hi."

00:15:19.980 --> 00:15:20.480
You know?

00:15:20.480 --> 00:15:22.830
But your dog were to
be lost, you'd call,

00:15:22.830 --> 00:15:25.720
and the web page would change
and say, "I was lost at 7:15,

00:15:25.720 --> 00:15:26.637
and call this number."

00:15:26.637 --> 00:15:28.470
It could be the Humane
Society, or whatever,

00:15:28.470 --> 00:15:31.480
and it would be like a system
to help you find your dog.

00:15:31.480 --> 00:15:33.900
It's just a web page to
help you find your dog.

00:15:33.900 --> 00:15:35.836
Or even a for sale sign.

00:15:35.836 --> 00:15:38.210
You would take a for sale sign
from the back of your car,

00:15:38.210 --> 00:15:41.340
but it could also link to
photos of the car, records,

00:15:41.340 --> 00:15:42.690
service records, and so forth.

00:15:42.690 --> 00:15:46.900
It just adds a richness
and a depth to things.

00:15:46.900 --> 00:15:48.920
So we feel this unlocks
an awful lot, especially

00:15:48.920 --> 00:15:53.210
because these beacons are
getting so inexpensive.

00:15:53.210 --> 00:15:56.610
So the web is famous for
this long tail of content.

00:15:56.610 --> 00:15:59.060
You know, like, the
bottom 99% of the web

00:15:59.060 --> 00:16:01.250
is bigger than the
1% type of thing.

00:16:01.250 --> 00:16:03.250
Because there's just so
many cool little things.

00:16:03.250 --> 00:16:05.620
Every example I showed you
today from vending machines,

00:16:05.620 --> 00:16:10.750
to bus stops, to luggage, or
toasters, is kind of-- meh,

00:16:10.750 --> 00:16:11.300
it's OK.

00:16:11.300 --> 00:16:12.715
But taken together,
it forms what

00:16:12.715 --> 00:16:14.840
we're kind of calling the
Long Tail of Interaction.

00:16:14.840 --> 00:16:16.423
It's the fact that
you could literally

00:16:16.423 --> 00:16:19.080
interact with almost anything
in a very lightweight way.

00:16:19.080 --> 00:16:23.420
And I want to stress that
it doesn't require the IoT.

00:16:23.420 --> 00:16:25.750
People often think that The
Physical Web is the IoT.

00:16:25.750 --> 00:16:28.630
And it's like, well, actually
we're just the UX gateway.

00:16:28.630 --> 00:16:30.270
We get you to that.

00:16:30.270 --> 00:16:33.990
Because, for example, I
can talk to a toaster.

00:16:33.990 --> 00:16:36.297
I mean, so many people take
toasters-- or any device--

00:16:36.297 --> 00:16:37.630
and they unpack it from the box.

00:16:37.630 --> 00:16:39.950
And it's got URLs and
QR codes all over it.

00:16:39.950 --> 00:16:42.110
And you unpack it, and
you throw the box away.

00:16:42.110 --> 00:16:46.050
And some poor marketer
loses his wings, right?

00:16:46.050 --> 00:16:49.440
Because this opportunity
has been lost, right?

00:16:49.440 --> 00:16:52.190
Well, imagine that URL could
now live inside the toaster.

00:16:52.190 --> 00:16:55.346
And you could-- now if you're
just going to push insurance

00:16:55.346 --> 00:16:56.470
on them, that's ridiculous.

00:16:56.470 --> 00:16:58.810
But if you were to have,
how to clean the crumb

00:16:58.810 --> 00:17:01.266
tray, and the recipe of the
week, and how to recycle it,

00:17:01.266 --> 00:17:03.140
you could actually add
value to this toaster.

00:17:03.140 --> 00:17:04.390
It would be quite interesting.

00:17:04.390 --> 00:17:06.920
And it's still just
a dumb toaster.

00:17:06.920 --> 00:17:09.260
There's no IoT
involved whatsoever.

00:17:09.260 --> 00:17:10.801
It's just engagement
with the user.

00:17:10.801 --> 00:17:12.300
So we feel like
there's an awful lot

00:17:12.300 --> 00:17:17.170
of value to The Physical
Web outside of the IoT.

00:17:17.170 --> 00:17:20.880
So we announced about, what,
15 months ago on GitHub.

00:17:20.880 --> 00:17:23.819
We're one of Google's most
popular GitHub reposts.

00:17:23.819 --> 00:17:26.359
We feel very strongly
about being open source.

00:17:26.359 --> 00:17:28.980
As I said before, the beacon,
the scanner, the server--

00:17:28.980 --> 00:17:30.230
it's all open source.

00:17:30.230 --> 00:17:31.150
And it's quite active.

00:17:31.150 --> 00:17:33.254
People are asking
lots of questions.

00:17:33.254 --> 00:17:34.670
It's also quite
exciting, the fact

00:17:34.670 --> 00:17:37.169
that Opera has already announced
that they've got a scanner.

00:17:37.169 --> 00:17:38.560
I bumped into somebody today.

00:17:38.560 --> 00:17:40.640
Blink's, they're working
on their own scanner.

00:17:40.640 --> 00:17:42.990
This makes us very
excited, because this

00:17:42.990 --> 00:17:44.850
has to be a part of the web.

00:17:44.850 --> 00:17:48.220
It can't succeed if it's
exclusively a Google product.

00:17:48.220 --> 00:17:51.690
It only will succeed if we, as
a community, want it to succeed,

00:17:51.690 --> 00:17:53.940
which is why I come out and
talk about this so much.

00:17:53.940 --> 00:17:55.560
It's just part of
the generic open web

00:17:55.560 --> 00:17:57.770
that anybody can be a part of.

00:17:57.770 --> 00:18:00.610
So we announced a Chrome Dev
Summit, about last month,

00:18:00.610 --> 00:18:04.400
that we are shipping Physical
Web in Chrome, but just to kind

00:18:04.400 --> 00:18:06.950
of kick start the market.

00:18:06.950 --> 00:18:10.010
If you happen to have
Chrome on your IOS machine,

00:18:10.010 --> 00:18:12.420
right now, you have
The Physical Web.

00:18:12.420 --> 00:18:13.610
And you just didn't know it.

00:18:13.610 --> 00:18:15.832
All you have to do is
open up the Today View,

00:18:15.832 --> 00:18:17.540
and turn on the Chrome
widget, and you'll

00:18:17.540 --> 00:18:19.410
see the beacons that we're
broadcasting around you, right

00:18:19.410 --> 00:18:19.931
now.

00:18:19.931 --> 00:18:21.430
I'm seeing people
diving, right now.

00:18:21.430 --> 00:18:23.780
It's kind of cool.

00:18:23.780 --> 00:18:26.820
We are in Chrome for
Android in the Dev

00:18:26.820 --> 00:18:30.260
build-- which means you've
got to go turn on a flag,

00:18:30.260 --> 00:18:31.420
and reboot the machine.

00:18:31.420 --> 00:18:33.530
It's a little bit
more for developers.

00:18:33.530 --> 00:18:35.405
We are working very
quickly to kind of get it

00:18:35.405 --> 00:18:37.446
into a public release,
which should be coming out

00:18:37.446 --> 00:18:38.180
this quarter.

00:18:38.180 --> 00:18:39.804
And we're very excited
for that coming.

00:18:39.804 --> 00:18:42.760
That should really, we think,
unlock an awful lot more.

00:18:42.760 --> 00:18:44.410
We have a much
better on onboarding

00:18:44.410 --> 00:18:45.872
experience with
Android, as well.

00:18:45.872 --> 00:18:47.580
Because what we're
going to be able to do

00:18:47.580 --> 00:18:51.600
is vibrate when you're
nearby a beacon, one time.

00:18:51.600 --> 00:18:53.517
And say, "Oh, can I turn
on The Physical Web?

00:18:53.517 --> 00:18:54.600
There's something nearby."

00:18:54.600 --> 00:18:56.604
And the user can say, no.

00:18:56.604 --> 00:18:58.020
But if they say,
yes, we will then

00:18:58.020 --> 00:18:59.410
opt them into The
Physical Web, and that'll

00:18:59.410 --> 00:19:00.230
get them up and running.

00:19:00.230 --> 00:19:02.438
We think that's going to be
a much better experience.

00:19:02.438 --> 00:19:04.976
And we hope by getting the
hundreds of millions of Android

00:19:04.976 --> 00:19:06.350
users working
this, this is going

00:19:06.350 --> 00:19:07.650
to really help quite a bit.

00:19:07.650 --> 00:19:11.312
So this is taking off right
now, and we're hoping that,

00:19:11.312 --> 00:19:12.770
say-- like I said,
by the beginning

00:19:12.770 --> 00:19:15.186
of second quarter-- it will
be a lot more activity for you

00:19:15.186 --> 00:19:16.870
guys to play with.

00:19:16.870 --> 00:19:19.719
So I tried very hard to
keep this to 15 minutes.

00:19:19.719 --> 00:19:21.010
I've got 15 minutes more to go.

00:19:21.010 --> 00:19:22.954
This usually engenders
tons of questions,

00:19:22.954 --> 00:19:25.120
so I wanted to wrap up, say
thank you for your time,

00:19:25.120 --> 00:19:26.150
and take some questions.

00:19:29.340 --> 00:19:30.698
Yes, sir.

00:19:30.698 --> 00:19:32.690
AUDIENCE: So how
does Chrome prevent

00:19:32.690 --> 00:19:35.470
the agents from the
first order from snipping

00:19:35.470 --> 00:19:36.399
the packets from--

00:19:36.399 --> 00:19:37.190
SCOTT JENSON: What?

00:19:37.190 --> 00:19:41.320
AUDIENCE: --well, the beacons
or the [INAUDIBLE], whatever,

00:19:41.320 --> 00:19:45.765
and phish your Chrome and
find a [? BB8 ?] and--

00:19:45.765 --> 00:19:47.640
SCOTT JENSON: Well, as
I mentioned before, we

00:19:47.640 --> 00:19:49.060
take many, many steps, right?

00:19:49.060 --> 00:19:51.250
So we make sure, for
example, that we're only

00:19:51.250 --> 00:19:54.740
using the advertising packet,
not the scan response packet.

00:19:54.740 --> 00:19:56.690
That protects you from
malicious beacons.

00:19:56.690 --> 00:19:58.564
Then we make sure that
we use a proxy service

00:19:58.564 --> 00:20:00.190
to make sure it
contacts the website.

00:20:00.190 --> 00:20:01.981
That prevents you from
being fingerprinted.

00:20:01.981 --> 00:20:04.640
We then use a filter
service to make sure

00:20:04.640 --> 00:20:06.710
that all malicious websites,
that we can detect,

00:20:06.710 --> 00:20:07.220
are removed.

00:20:07.220 --> 00:20:08.970
And then we open it
up inside the browser,

00:20:08.970 --> 00:20:10.254
which has its own sandbox.

00:20:10.254 --> 00:20:11.920
So we take multiple
steps along the way.

00:20:11.920 --> 00:20:13.662
And HTTPS, by the
way, prevents any "man

00:20:13.662 --> 00:20:14.620
in the middle" attacks.

00:20:14.620 --> 00:20:16.494
AUDIENCE: What about
the beacon communicating

00:20:16.494 --> 00:20:18.240
to your smart phone?

00:20:18.240 --> 00:20:19.690
SCOTT JENSON: Yeah?

00:20:19.690 --> 00:20:25.552
AUDIENCE: How do you verify that
this is authentic, that this--

00:20:25.552 --> 00:20:26.510
SCOTT JENSON: We don't.

00:20:26.510 --> 00:20:27.924
It's just a URL.

00:20:27.924 --> 00:20:31.502
AUDIENCE: Yeah, but could I
phish the URL [INAUDIBLE]?

00:20:31.502 --> 00:20:33.960
SCOTT JENSON: Well, we would--
our proxy service would then

00:20:33.960 --> 00:20:36.357
remove that phishing
URL from your list,

00:20:36.357 --> 00:20:37.440
assuming we can detect it.

00:20:37.440 --> 00:20:39.570
I mean, it's-- by the way, I
don't want to guarantee it.

00:20:39.570 --> 00:20:41.570
It's always-- it's always
an acceleration, but--

00:20:41.570 --> 00:20:43.637
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:20:43.637 --> 00:20:45.970
SCOTT JENSON: Anybody who
says 100% guarantee is clearly

00:20:45.970 --> 00:20:47.178
selling you something, right?

00:20:47.178 --> 00:20:48.340
So you can't do that.

00:20:48.340 --> 00:20:50.674
AUDIENCE: Have any other
beacon platforms picking it up?

00:20:50.674 --> 00:20:52.090
SCOTT JENSON:
Beacon-- well, we're

00:20:52.090 --> 00:20:53.550
based on top of Eddystone.

00:20:53.550 --> 00:20:56.330
And so, there's, what,
18 to 25-- depending

00:20:56.330 --> 00:20:58.367
on who you count--
beacons manufacturers

00:20:58.367 --> 00:20:59.200
that are doing this.

00:20:59.200 --> 00:21:00.810
And they're all--
the feedback we've

00:21:00.810 --> 00:21:02.080
been getting is really strong.

00:21:02.080 --> 00:21:05.370
Because they've tried the kind
of the classic approach before,

00:21:05.370 --> 00:21:08.410
and they find it's just really
hard to get small company

00:21:08.410 --> 00:21:09.770
apps to be installed.

00:21:09.770 --> 00:21:12.306
And so once anybody can
kind of go into a store

00:21:12.306 --> 00:21:14.180
and get an experience
without selling an app,

00:21:14.180 --> 00:21:16.430
they're, like, pretty
excited by that.

00:21:16.430 --> 00:21:18.436
So, like anything,
I think it's going

00:21:18.436 --> 00:21:19.560
to be a chicken or the egg.

00:21:19.560 --> 00:21:25.570
So we're talking to a lot
of advanced ad agencies,

00:21:25.570 --> 00:21:27.270
experimental places,
As soon as we--

00:21:27.270 --> 00:21:30.109
I think, once we ship on
Chrome to 800 million phones,

00:21:30.109 --> 00:21:31.900
I think a lot more
people will get started.

00:21:31.900 --> 00:21:32.970
But let's be clear.

00:21:32.970 --> 00:21:36.560
It's going take a little while
for the ecosystem to grow.

00:21:36.560 --> 00:21:38.364
Yeah?

00:21:38.364 --> 00:21:40.190
AUDIENCE: I got super
excited about this.

00:21:40.190 --> 00:21:44.303
And I noticed, in our
little kits that we got,

00:21:44.303 --> 00:21:45.725
it came with a Bluetooth beacon.

00:21:45.725 --> 00:21:46.933
SCOTT JENSON: That's correct.

00:21:46.933 --> 00:21:48.862
AUDIENCE: Can I add
my own URL to that?

00:21:48.862 --> 00:21:50.570
SCOTT JENSON: That is
a Bluvision beacon.

00:21:50.570 --> 00:21:53.769
You need to use the
BEEKS app-- B-E-E-K-S.

00:21:53.769 --> 00:21:55.560
And then when you
install that application,

00:21:55.560 --> 00:21:58.030
it will allow you to set it.

00:21:58.030 --> 00:22:00.090
Each beacon manufacturer,
at this point,

00:22:00.090 --> 00:22:02.580
has its own
application to set it.

00:22:02.580 --> 00:22:04.560
And we are actually
working on trying to make

00:22:04.560 --> 00:22:05.910
that a more unified experience.

00:22:05.910 --> 00:22:07.580
We hope to tell you more
about that in next quarter.

00:22:07.580 --> 00:22:09.380
Because, obviously,
being able to set them

00:22:09.380 --> 00:22:12.220
in a more uniform way would
be a very useful thing to do.

00:22:12.220 --> 00:22:13.970
We've heard loud and
clear from people,

00:22:13.970 --> 00:22:15.074
we need to improve that.

00:22:21.040 --> 00:22:22.104
Yes, sir.

00:22:22.104 --> 00:22:24.816
AUDIENCE: So could I suggest
that [INAUDIBLE] for beacons

00:22:24.816 --> 00:22:28.050
like this have a default initial
URL with a link to the page

00:22:28.050 --> 00:22:29.450
to [? bootstrap up ?]?

00:22:29.450 --> 00:22:30.490
SCOTT JENSON: Well, if
you open up Physical Web,

00:22:30.490 --> 00:22:31.490
you'll see it right now.

00:22:31.490 --> 00:22:32.115
AUDIENCE: Good.

00:22:34.184 --> 00:22:35.600
SCOTT JENSON: I
mean, right now, I

00:22:35.600 --> 00:22:36.975
think the beacons
that you'll see

00:22:36.975 --> 00:22:39.810
will be to the agenda
to this, and then one

00:22:39.810 --> 00:22:42.070
to The Physical Web, and
there is one, I think,

00:22:42.070 --> 00:22:42.830
to the front page.

00:22:42.830 --> 00:22:44.690
So you should be able to see at
least three beacons, right now.

00:22:44.690 --> 00:22:46.740
And I always carry one
in my pocket to my blog,

00:22:46.740 --> 00:22:49.410
just because I'm a selfless,
shameless self-promoter.

00:22:52.360 --> 00:22:55.950
And, by the way, we do
not recommend-- I mean,

00:22:55.950 --> 00:22:57.900
the huge power of
The Physical Web,

00:22:57.900 --> 00:23:01.489
right now, is primarily in
ephemeral public interaction.

00:23:01.489 --> 00:23:03.030
A number of people
have thought, this

00:23:03.030 --> 00:23:05.710
is a great idea to put on badges
and for people to carry around.

00:23:05.710 --> 00:23:08.040
Well, now you're basically
advertising yourself

00:23:08.040 --> 00:23:10.390
and walking around with a
very uniform fingerprint that

00:23:10.390 --> 00:23:11.630
can be tracked.

00:23:11.630 --> 00:23:15.136
So if you want to do something
that's very personal,

00:23:15.136 --> 00:23:16.760
attached to people,
then you'd probably

00:23:16.760 --> 00:23:19.070
want to go to the ephemeral
ID standard-- a very

00:23:19.070 --> 00:23:21.410
different thing, a new
packet for Eddystone.

00:23:21.410 --> 00:23:24.200
This primarily should be
attached to public things

00:23:24.200 --> 00:23:26.159
for ephemeral lightweight
information that's

00:23:26.159 --> 00:23:27.200
safe and public and open.

00:23:27.200 --> 00:23:29.960
That just takes a lot
of the risk out of it.

00:23:29.960 --> 00:23:30.845
Yes?

00:23:30.845 --> 00:23:33.730
AUDIENCE: What about
powering beacons?

00:23:33.730 --> 00:23:38.300
Are you just limited to public
things that have power already?

00:23:38.300 --> 00:23:41.250
SCOTT JENSON: So the question
is about powering beacons.

00:23:41.250 --> 00:23:44.910
Beacons are changing
so radically.

00:23:44.910 --> 00:23:47.520
The beacons I was
using a year ago

00:23:47.520 --> 00:23:49.960
were half as efficient as
the ones I'm using right now.

00:23:49.960 --> 00:23:52.860
So we've got a beacon right
now that's about this big,

00:23:52.860 --> 00:23:57.060
with a [? CR24-75 ?] in it, and
it's lasted for three years.

00:23:57.060 --> 00:23:58.730
And once you get past
two years, people

00:23:58.730 --> 00:24:00.510
don't seem to care anymore.

00:24:00.510 --> 00:24:04.140
And yet, these are basically
the, what, 2.4 volt?

00:24:04.140 --> 00:24:05.640
There's already
been an announcement

00:24:05.640 --> 00:24:09.000
of 1 volt chips, which will
last almost three times longer.

00:24:09.000 --> 00:24:12.160
So we really do expect that
the battery issue is almost

00:24:12.160 --> 00:24:14.470
going to go away within,
probably, 18 months.

00:24:14.470 --> 00:24:15.270
I was just at CES.

00:24:15.270 --> 00:24:16.728
There's a company
called [? Biko ?]

00:24:16.728 --> 00:24:18.630
that basically has
a small device that

00:24:18.630 --> 00:24:21.400
clips to fluorescent lights.

00:24:21.400 --> 00:24:23.562
And they have a PV cell
inside, and that gives it

00:24:23.562 --> 00:24:24.520
more than enough power.

00:24:24.520 --> 00:24:26.436
So you clip it, and as
long as the light's on,

00:24:26.436 --> 00:24:27.250
it runs forever.

00:24:27.250 --> 00:24:30.337
So there's quickly
changing, this idea.

00:24:30.337 --> 00:24:32.670
Keep in mind, by the way,
that the Bluetooth standard is

00:24:32.670 --> 00:24:35.460
changing from 4.2 to 5,
which will become more

00:24:35.460 --> 00:24:37.390
prevalent probably this fall.

00:24:37.390 --> 00:24:39.200
So in a year and a
half to two years,

00:24:39.200 --> 00:24:40.783
most people are going
to probably want

00:24:40.783 --> 00:24:43.340
to change out the beacons
to the new standard, anyway.

00:24:43.340 --> 00:24:46.300
So I think, by the
time we get to 5,

00:24:46.300 --> 00:24:49.020
it's easy to imagine these
beacons lasting, if not five

00:24:49.020 --> 00:24:50.167
years, indefinitely.

00:24:50.167 --> 00:24:51.500
AUDIENCE: More power efficiency.

00:24:51.500 --> 00:24:53.847
SCOTT JENSON: Significantly
more power efficiency, yeah.

00:24:53.847 --> 00:24:56.180
We've definitely noticed that
it's changed an awful lot.

00:24:56.180 --> 00:24:59.030
That, initially, a
lot of these SOCs

00:24:59.030 --> 00:25:01.610
would take a tremendous
amount of power to power up,

00:25:01.610 --> 00:25:05.150
and then the broadcasting would
be a much smaller part of it.

00:25:05.150 --> 00:25:07.510
But now, what we're seeing
is they're so efficient, they

00:25:07.510 --> 00:25:09.650
power up quickly and lightly,
and most of the power

00:25:09.650 --> 00:25:11.240
is the actual transmission,
which is a good sign.

00:25:11.240 --> 00:25:12.335
It means they're getting
much more efficient.

00:25:12.335 --> 00:25:13.550
AUDIENCE: How about the range?

00:25:13.550 --> 00:25:15.050
SCOTT JENSON: The range
is really up to you,

00:25:15.050 --> 00:25:16.250
as far as how much
power you want

00:25:16.250 --> 00:25:17.570
to pump into it in the antenna.

00:25:17.570 --> 00:25:19.170
If you're willing to
plug it into a wall

00:25:19.170 --> 00:25:20.586
and put a big
antenna, this sucker

00:25:20.586 --> 00:25:22.640
could go 100 yards, 100 meters.

00:25:22.640 --> 00:25:24.600
But most of these
systems are going to be,

00:25:24.600 --> 00:25:27.570
like, say, 30 to 40 feet,
if you wanted to have

00:25:27.570 --> 00:25:30.876
it last for a long time.

00:25:30.876 --> 00:25:32.500
By the way, we do
simple little things,

00:25:32.500 --> 00:25:34.124
which is like, in
this particular case,

00:25:34.124 --> 00:25:36.380
we've blanketed this place
with about four beacons,

00:25:36.380 --> 00:25:38.140
all broadcasting the same URL.

00:25:38.140 --> 00:25:39.590
When you pull out
our scanner, we

00:25:39.590 --> 00:25:42.790
may see three of those four
URLs, be we'll de-dupe them

00:25:42.790 --> 00:25:44.240
and only show you
the one, right?

00:25:44.240 --> 00:25:45.781
And that makes it
really easy for you

00:25:45.781 --> 00:25:48.555
to just kind of wantonly scatter
them around, just to make sure

00:25:48.555 --> 00:25:49.930
you get coverage,
but you'll just

00:25:49.930 --> 00:25:51.820
see the one URL in the scanner.

00:25:51.820 --> 00:25:53.581
Little things like
that are nice.

00:25:53.581 --> 00:25:54.080
OK.

00:25:54.080 --> 00:25:54.635
We're all set?

00:25:54.635 --> 00:25:55.090
MALE SPEAKER: Yeah.

00:25:55.090 --> 00:25:55.798
SCOTT JENSON: OK.

00:25:55.798 --> 00:25:56.650
That's the time.

00:25:56.650 --> 00:25:58.566
And I'll be outside if
you have any questions.

00:25:58.566 --> 00:25:59.570
Thanks very much.
