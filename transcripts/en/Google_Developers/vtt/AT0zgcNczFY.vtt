00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:01.170
&gt;&gt; Brad Neuberg mini--I don't--Brad's actually
a relatively newcomer to SVG. You'd been doing

00:00:01.170 --> 00:00:01.190
SVG for a year and a half, two years, but
I think a lot of us already know his name

00:00:01.190 --> 00:00:01.210
because of the work that he's done with SVG
web and advocacy within Google and he's just--he's

00:00:01.210 --> 00:00:01.220
very--he's another passionate person about,
about the open web. He started a mailing lists

00:00:01.220 --> 00:00:01.240
called the--well, I guess a project, the Open
Web Project and he's really helping move SVG

00:00:01.240 --> 00:00:01.260
and other open web technologies forward. So,
I just want to thank Brad for helping set

00:00:01.260 --> 00:00:01.280
up this conference at Google and I want to
welcome him to the stage to do his key note.

00:00:01.280 --> 00:00:01.290
&gt;&gt; NEUBERG: So, sorry for the technical difficulties,
I'm giving this about an hour earlier than

00:00:01.290 --> 00:00:01.570
expected. Any--bring this guy up from sleep.
So while we wait, I know we've got people

00:00:01.570 --> 00:00:07.103
from all over the world here, people have
communicated--have traveled from all over.

00:00:01.570 --> 00:00:07.236
So who here is coming from Europe? Wow. Wow.
So who is here from the States? And who's

00:00:01.570 --> 00:00:07.170
right here from California? Nice. And some
other places, just yell out that you might

00:00:01.570 --> 00:00:07.636
be from. Australia. Nice. Canada. North Carolina.
Okay. Yeah, we have some folks from Japan.

00:00:01.570 --> 00:00:07.170
Yeah? Welcome. Where are you from in Japan?
Where in Japan? Tokyo. Nice. And how many

00:00:01.570 --> 00:00:07.103
of you--is this your first SVG Open? Yeah,
right. I don't believe this guy here. And

00:00:01.570 --> 00:00:06.836
who has been to every single SVG Open that's
ever happened? Yeah. The organizer.

00:00:01.570 --> 00:00:07.503
&gt;&gt; So for those of you who didn't see that--I
think the lone hand that raised up, that was

00:00:01.570 --> 00:00:07.236
Andreas Neumann who started this conference
series in 2002 and who has been a huge SVG

00:00:01.570 --> 00:00:06.503
advocate. So I would--everybody, a round of
applause for Andreas Neumann. .

00:00:01.570 --> 00:00:04.720
&gt;&gt; NEUBERG: Okay, looks like weÃ­ve got
slides. So, hi, thanks everyone for being

00:00:04.720 --> 00:00:09.320
here. My name is Brad Neuberg. I'm with Google.
Today, I'm going to be talking about a variety

00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:14.290
of things. I'm going to talk about how we
used SVG at Google, why we're excited about

00:00:14.290 --> 00:00:22.060
it, and some of the work that we've been doing
with Internet Explorer to enable SVG. So starting,

00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:26.300
I just want to say, this is a really exciting
time, in some ways, I'm relatively new to

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:32.560
the SVG community and it feels like there's
a real renaissance happening. I'll touch more

00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:40.000
on that, but this year and next year, we're
seeing everything from all of the browsers,

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:48.330
of Firefox, Safari Chrome, Opera, all having
SVG implementations. We're seeing real authoring

00:00:48.330 --> 00:00:53.530
tools like Inkscape; Adobe Illustrator has
good import and export. We're seeing real

00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:58.230
adoption and interest and this is kind of
writing a general wave, the last year and

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:04.920
a half we're really seeing HTML 5 take off,
CSS3, Web Fonts, so it's really an exciting

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:10.620
time. And before I kind of get into the bulk
of some of the steps, I want to talk about--I

00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:15.660
want to really acknowledge, I think SVG has
a really special history. I've been to a lot

00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:20.400
of computer communities and this one; I'm
just really blown away by the kind of level

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:27.690
of passion and the level of commitment. And
I want to briefly kind of call out to some

00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:34.350
of the folks who I think really worked in
the 2005-2006 time period or kind of talk

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:38.690
about some of the work our group is doing
and how we arrived at SVG. But I look back

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:43.780
at the folks working in 2005-2006 and I think
these are the folks that were really doing

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:48.260
this out of a labor of love, really helped
move things forward to that next step which

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:52.390
is why we're here at the sort of beginning
of this renaissance. So, I want to kind of

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:55.510
briefly call out some of their names. I know
I'm going to miss some people. Like, I said

00:01:55.510 --> 00:01:59.260
this is a great community. There are a lot
of folks doing lots of cool stuff. So, I briefly

00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:05.670
want to call out--some of the folks--well,
I already did too many but Jon Cruz, obviously,

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:09.640
him and the team of Inkscape. If you havenÃ­t
checked out Inkscape, it's a pretty amazing

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:16.080
piece of open source software. Of course,
everyone involved with the Firefox, SVG implementation,

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:22.340
I think they really came out with a really
strong work, one of the first folks to really

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:30.670
bring this in the browsers. Everyone involved
in WebKit, in Opera, bringing those implementations

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:37.030
to light. And then no community is complete
without the evangelist, the people writing

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:41.690
books, the people writing articles. I've gotten
here some of the stories about organizing

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:45.740
this conference year after year. It's a volunteer
created conference of--I've watched them in

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:50.209
action. It's pretty amazing all over the world
putting this together. So, I'm just sort of--I

00:02:50.209 --> 00:02:56.590
want to call out some of the names of folks
who I've really seen--really being evangelists.

00:02:56.590 --> 00:03:02.630
And, you know, working the nights, working
the weekends because they believe in this

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:08.270
technology. So, I just want to kind of give
them a shout out, of course, and more, I know

00:03:08.270 --> 00:03:14.810
I miss people. So, if I did, please give yourself
a pat on the back. So I want to share a personal

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:23.620
story. In 2004, early 2005, I was a dynamic
HTML hacker. I was a JavaScript guy, and this

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:30.140
was before the fancy name AJAX. It was not
an easy time to a be a JavaScript person or

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:34.300
a DHTML person. WeÃ­ve got Alex over here
and I think he can call it the great dark

00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:38.750
ages of DHTML as some of us call it. And the
reason I bring it up, I think there's a lot

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:45.959
of parallels with SVG. I remember 2004, going
to the bookstore, looking for books on DHTML

00:03:45.959 --> 00:03:50.200
and they were all out of print. I remember
I was at the startup company at that time

00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:54.300
and we had a web based aggregator for fees,
and I remember saying, "Hey, why don't we

00:03:54.300 --> 00:03:59.129
use DHTML and this XTMLHP request thing. We
didn't have a shorter name for that, yet.

00:03:59.129 --> 00:04:03.580
You had to say the full thing. Let's make
something more interactive and people laughed

00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:09.370
at me. And they say, "Hey, DHTML, that's dead.
That's buggy. That's not enough places." And

00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:15.580
then, of course, we all know history, 2005
rolls around. Sites like Flicker, Google maps

00:04:15.580 --> 00:04:20.749
helps legitimize DHTML and gives it a nice
new name AJAX and the rest is history. Suddenly

00:04:20.749 --> 00:04:25.499
everyone woke up and said, "Hey, wow. This
stuff is all over the place." We can get real

00:04:25.499 --> 00:04:33.449
work done. And the interesting thing about
DHTML and AJAX is that it really was invented

00:04:33.449 --> 00:04:39.719
by Microsoft in 1997 with Outlook Web Access.
And it took about eight years for folks to

00:04:39.719 --> 00:04:43.710
kind of wake up and realize, "Hey, I can use
this stuff. I can do real work. I can get

00:04:43.710 --> 00:04:52.020
interesting things done." And so a renaissance
really happened with DHTML and the same thing

00:04:52.020 --> 00:04:58.370
is happening with SVG. I like to kind of paraphrase
Gandhi--I know it's a little overused, but

00:04:58.370 --> 00:05:03.650
I think it's overused because there's truth
to it. I'm kind of paraphrasing Gandhi, the

00:05:03.650 --> 00:05:09.610
famous thing: first, they ignore you, and
then they hype the heck out of you. Then they

00:05:09.610 --> 00:05:16.680
leave you for dead and then suddenly you're
getting real work done. Okay. DHTML went through

00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:22.110
the same thing. If for some reason, web technologies
have to go through this worse than everything

00:05:22.110 --> 00:05:27.309
else, JavaScript went through the same thing.
JavaScript was a shunned language. CSS went

00:05:27.309 --> 00:05:31.770
through the same thing. You know, in 2001
talking about CSS, you know, you had to wear

00:05:31.770 --> 00:05:40.449
one of those asbestos suits. So, I want to,
you know, now, that I've kind of shared that,

00:05:40.449 --> 00:05:46.539
that really I think the parallels are very
strong with DHTML. I want to just briefly

00:05:46.539 --> 00:05:52.479
talk about why is Google excited. Why are
we so excited about SVG? Well, I don't think

00:05:52.479 --> 00:05:58.680
it's been a secret that we're excited about
the web; we're excited about HTML 5. And generally,

00:05:58.680 --> 00:06:02.520
when we use the term HTML 5, it's kind of
determining the end of the term AJAX for better

00:06:02.520 --> 00:06:07.659
or worse that--like a larger term. It's not
just the spec. And it's becoming a bit of

00:06:07.659 --> 00:06:13.649
a place holder for all these great web technology
that can really advance things forward. The

00:06:13.649 --> 00:06:22.050
formal HTML 5 spec, things like Geolocation,
Web Fonts, SVGs, CSS3, faster JavaScript,

00:06:22.050 --> 00:06:28.509
we're rally bullish on HTML 5 and this whole
family of technologies because we see it solving

00:06:28.509 --> 00:06:36.009
real problems. One of the most exciting formal
aspects of HTML 5, the spec, is that it now

00:06:36.009 --> 00:06:43.779
allows you to drop SVG right into a normal
HTML page. SVG just becomes more tags that

00:06:43.779 --> 00:06:49.029
you can add to HTML, but now everything doesn't
have to be a box, and everything doesn't have

00:06:49.029 --> 00:06:52.879
to be a Div [PH] or a table. Now, you have
circles and rectangles. It's kind of a straightforward

00:06:52.879 --> 00:06:56.349
idea and we should have had it a long time
ago. But now that we are going to have it

00:06:56.349 --> 00:07:05.589
and that's really exciting. You know, I think--we're
a search company. I know sometimes we do things

00:07:05.589 --> 00:07:09.319
that we're not--you know, we're doing things
outside of search but we like things that

00:07:09.319 --> 00:07:14.520
are human readable, that are text friendly
because they're searchable and SVG is very

00:07:14.520 --> 00:07:20.119
searchable. Especially, you know, someone
once asked me, "Why would I want to search

00:07:20.119 --> 00:07:23.960
a vector image?" If it's an illustration of
a tiger, you don't want to search that. If

00:07:23.960 --> 00:07:28.499
it's a medical diagram, if it's electoral
results for the last election we just went

00:07:28.499 --> 00:07:33.490
through, these are interesting things we want
in search results. And what makes SVG so cool

00:07:33.490 --> 00:07:39.169
is it's not just images, but hyperlinks can
be inside and point inside of them. That stuff

00:07:39.169 --> 00:07:47.490
that can be used for Pagerink for signals,
that's interesting. There's a market demand

00:07:47.490 --> 00:07:52.589
for SVG and vector graphics on the web. I
want to share this story a little bit later

00:07:52.589 --> 00:07:58.349
for why the group I'm on chose vector graphics
and SVG, in particularly the first one. But

00:07:58.349 --> 00:08:04.080
folks want to be able to do drawing on the
web. They want SVG in canvass. I'll talk about

00:08:04.080 --> 00:08:12.209
both of those in a bit. There's a clear market
demand, and so, developers want this. Another

00:08:12.209 --> 00:08:16.969
reason Google is so excited and bullish about
SVG is it integrates; it works with the rest

00:08:16.969 --> 00:08:22.699
of the web stack. It integrates with CSS and
HTML and JavaScript. You donÃ­t have to

00:08:22.699 --> 00:08:27.069
learn a whole new set of technologies, you
learn this--you use the skills you already

00:08:27.069 --> 00:08:32.039
know. So that's really exciting, that level
of integration, I think that we're going to

00:08:32.039 --> 00:08:36.530
start seeing more and more interesting things
because it's not just trapped within a little

00:08:36.530 --> 00:08:45.400
box. It's really a part of the browser. One
of the other reasons is SVG is a View Source

00:08:45.400 --> 00:08:50.300
Technology. So View Source technologies doesn't
mean that you have the right to, you know,

00:08:50.300 --> 00:08:55.050
look at everyone's source code. But it does
mean that it makes it much easier to learn

00:08:55.050 --> 00:09:00.990
from what other people are doing. I have found
this so much in the last year and a half.

00:09:00.990 --> 00:09:04.700
I'll see a cool demo from Doug or from Rick
Masters, or a lot of the folks here in this

00:09:04.700 --> 00:09:07.440
community and I'll say, "How the heck did
they do that?" I just go to View Source. I

00:09:07.440 --> 00:09:11.260
learn from what they're doing. That's really
powerful, and that really underguards the

00:09:11.260 --> 00:09:16.280
web itself. And then if it's open source,
it's easy, you cut and paste. You like that

00:09:16.280 --> 00:09:21.740
gradient, grab the definition. If it's an
open source font and the definition is right

00:09:21.740 --> 00:09:28.500
in the file, cut and paste that. That's really
cool. And finally, we're excited about SVG

00:09:28.500 --> 00:09:34.180
because it's easy to import and export. That
means you don't get trapped into any specific

00:09:34.180 --> 00:09:40.610
tool. And it's also very server-friendly.
You can throw up a PHP Script, a Google App

00:09:40.610 --> 00:09:48.330
Engine site that emits SVG as easily as you
do HTML. It's much harder to omit binary objects,

00:09:48.330 --> 00:09:52.640
but you can use any standard templating language
to spit out a little bit of SVG, especially

00:09:52.640 --> 00:10:02.200
with HTML5 because you can mix it in line.
So now that you know a little bit about why

00:10:02.200 --> 00:10:09.740
we're excited about SVG, let's look at, you
know, where we're putting our sort of--our

00:10:09.740 --> 00:10:14.140
commitment to it. How are we actually using
SVG? I'm just going to show you a few of the

00:10:14.140 --> 00:10:18.860
places. One of them is, I donÃ­t know who
here is--so, in Google Docs, you can actually

00:10:18.860 --> 00:10:23.190
drop illustrations in and you have kind of
a lightweight diagramming and drawing tool,

00:10:23.190 --> 00:10:27.900
which is great if you're trying to explain
something. Had anyone gotten the chance to

00:10:27.900 --> 00:10:35.170
play with this, awesome. This uses SVG. It
uses SVG on every web browser. It has to use

00:10:35.170 --> 00:10:40.560
VML and IE, but we use SVG on all the other
browsers. Here's an example drawing. My drawing

00:10:40.560 --> 00:10:45.850
skills are pretty lousy, so I had to find
someone else to give me a good drawing. My

00:10:45.850 --> 00:10:51.480
original one was like a happy face and someone
was like, "That does not look very good."

00:10:51.480 --> 00:10:57.340
So last night, I'm like, "Who has a picture?"
Another place we use is something called the

00:10:57.340 --> 00:11:02.550
Google Visualization API. This is a really
cool API that you can give a data from many

00:11:02.550 --> 00:11:09.490
different kinds of data sources. JASON, XML,
on the URL, a Google spreadsheet, and it will

00:11:09.490 --> 00:11:14.540
give you different kinds of visualizations.
Well, this is a perfect used case for SVG.

00:11:14.540 --> 00:11:28.780
And some of the visualizations do use SVG.
Let me show you some of these.
This right--this right here is actually--it's

00:11:28.780 --> 00:11:33.340
called the gauge. It's a visualization alternating
into a gauge. You give it the right E values,

00:11:33.340 --> 00:11:38.270
and you're actually looking at a Google spreadsheet
that has what is known as a gadget. And that

00:11:38.270 --> 00:11:45.060
gadget has the visualization in it. Turtles
[PH] all the way down. And these gauges are

00:11:45.060 --> 00:11:48.560
actually SVGs. So as we change the size, it
still stays beautiful. That's the scaleable

00:11:48.560 --> 00:11:54.530
aspect. And it's actually, the gauges are
keeping track of memory in CPUs. So that's

00:11:54.530 --> 00:12:04.220
one of them. Here's another nice one, a simple
pie chart, click in and get the breakdown.

00:12:04.220 --> 00:12:08.460
The cool thing about the Google Visualization
API, it's very easy to use. You can even just

00:12:08.460 --> 00:12:14.620
give it a URL and it will return back the
results of what you're looking at. So it's

00:12:14.620 --> 00:12:23.090
very straightforward to use. One of the final
places we use SVG is we have, you know, like

00:12:23.090 --> 00:12:28.670
most companies--we've got an extensive set
of JavaScript libraries. And one of them has

00:12:28.670 --> 00:12:35.080
a cross-browser drawing abstraction that uses
SVG on every browser. Again, it does use VML

00:12:35.080 --> 00:12:40.120
and IE, and that gives you a standard way
to do drawing. And a lot of our products use

00:12:40.120 --> 00:12:47.810
that as a consistent API. So these are some
of the places that we use SVG internally.

00:12:47.810 --> 00:12:53.680
I want to share a little bit about the group
that I'm on and sort of get into some of the

00:12:53.680 --> 00:12:59.540
work we've been doing. I'm on a group called
Open Web Advocacy. Our motto is help web technologies

00:12:59.540 --> 00:13:04.230
get better faster, and depending if we're
on a good mood or not. Sometimes it's; help

00:13:04.230 --> 00:13:08.530
web technologies get better faster. Sometimes
it's; help web technologies suck less better

00:13:08.530 --> 00:13:16.270
faster, depending if we're happy or not. But
our job is to really get out there and educate,

00:13:16.270 --> 00:13:23.120
evangelize. A lot of us have a JavaScript
background, so we create JavaScript toolkits

00:13:23.120 --> 00:13:27.330
that help bring along other browsers so we
can have more parity because it's hard for

00:13:27.330 --> 00:13:31.580
developers to use a new technology if it's
not everywhere, so helping the chicken and

00:13:31.580 --> 00:13:37.640
egg problem. So we wear a lot of different
hats. And about--we are--our group started

00:13:37.640 --> 00:13:42.120
about a year ago. And when we kicked off,
we were like, "What should we focus on first?"

00:13:42.120 --> 00:13:47.600
each of us sort of attacked different problem
sets. And on my side, I said, "What do developers

00:13:47.600 --> 00:13:52.820
want?" So, I went to something called the
OpenAjax Alliance's Browser Wish List. It's

00:13:52.820 --> 00:14:01.660
a very cool survey that was done a while back.
Actually, another one is coming up. And this

00:14:01.660 --> 00:14:07.490
asked a tremendous number of developers, "What
do you want?" If you could grab the browser

00:14:07.490 --> 00:14:12.570
makers by the lapels and say, "Here's what
I want." What would that be? And what do you

00:14:12.570 --> 00:14:19.720
think the number one request by far that everything
else above--across the domain requests, other

00:14:19.720 --> 00:14:21.600
various kinds of things. What do you think
the number one request was? I donÃ­t know.

00:14:21.600 --> 00:14:26.380
What do you--Doug, what do you think it was?

00:14:26.380 --> 00:14:27.320
&gt;&gt; VML?

00:14:27.320 --> 00:14:34.250
&gt;&gt; NEUBERG: The VML? So the number one request
was we want web vector graphics. Specifically,

00:14:34.250 --> 00:14:41.660
we want SVG and the canvas tag on every browser.
That was the number one request. So that made

00:14:41.660 --> 00:14:48.090
our job easy. We said, "Here's the number
one request. Let's take a look at that." My

00:14:48.090 --> 00:14:53.210
background again is in JavaScript. Like I
said, I generally end up getting browsers

00:14:53.210 --> 00:14:59.400
to do things they weren't really designed
to do. And so, I said, "We already have some

00:14:59.400 --> 00:15:03.720
JavaScript help for the canvas tag on IE that
Erik Arvidson, Emil Eklund and other folks

00:15:03.720 --> 00:15:08.529
at Google had worked on. I said, "What can
we do with SVG? How can we help SVG? So sort

00:15:08.529 --> 00:15:15.810
of--if I had only known what it would take.
Sort of delved down into that in terms of

00:15:15.810 --> 00:15:23.050
how can we help bring along IE on this front.
Because I want to get into--we've seen amazing

00:15:23.050 --> 00:15:27.130
progress. And one of the things I want to
share too, a year ago too, I said, "Where

00:15:27.130 --> 00:15:31.360
is SVG?" I've always been a fan of it. I said,
"Where does it come from?" And last year,

00:15:31.360 --> 00:15:35.140
I was blown away when I looked back at the
state of the community. I was like, "Wow,

00:15:35.140 --> 00:15:39.310
there are implementations everywhere." We've
got Authoring Tools. We've got this excited

00:15:39.310 --> 00:15:44.270
community and real stuff happening. Wikipedia
which we'll talk about and Brion is also here

00:15:44.270 --> 00:15:48.839
for the conference. He's doing an amazing
work with SVG, the sixth largest site on the

00:15:48.839 --> 00:15:57.680
web. I was blown away at how much had happened.
So I want to--and I said, what can help us

00:15:57.680 --> 00:16:02.880
get to that next step. What's the next sort
of progression to help things go forward?

00:16:02.880 --> 00:16:07.570
Before getting into that, I do want to say,
I don't want to beat up Mark [INDISTINCT].

00:16:07.570 --> 00:16:12.240
I really respect that they came to the conference
this year. I really respect that they're here

00:16:12.240 --> 00:16:16.070
having a dialogue, sending real people. I
think we should give them a round of applause.

00:16:16.070 --> 00:16:24.380
I think that's really cool. I hope that's
not embarrassing. I'm embarrassing them. I'm

00:16:24.380 --> 00:16:28.260
embarrassing them. I know for many JavaScript
hackers, we've learned DHTML on IE. I know

00:16:28.260 --> 00:16:35.880
I did. So I think it's really cool to have
you here at the event this year. At the same

00:16:35.880 --> 00:16:40.120
time, one of the things that is blocking SVG
from going to that next step is we've got

00:16:40.120 --> 00:16:45.410
this awesome implementations but we donÃ­t
have them on IE yet. And that is hurting developers

00:16:45.410 --> 00:16:52.020
who are bursting at the seams to deploy stuff
with this. So finding some kind of realistic

00:16:52.020 --> 00:16:57.130
way to help address that issue was one of
the things our team wanted to look at. And

00:16:57.130 --> 00:17:03.580
one of the--the other point is a little subtle.
The fact that SVG doesn't work in the 99.9%

00:17:03.580 --> 00:17:08.230
of DHMTL that's out there. This is not an
appropriate time to get into XHTML versus

00:17:08.230 --> 00:17:14.110
HTML, but I'd like to say when you go in and
you're getting a PhD thesis, your research

00:17:14.110 --> 00:17:19.169
adviser says, "Choose one research topic."
If you show up and you got two or three novel

00:17:19.169 --> 00:17:24.490
things, they'll say, "Go back to the drawing
board." Chaining SVG to XHTML is two research

00:17:24.490 --> 00:17:29.049
topics at the minimum. It's saying, they both
have to succeed or they both unfortunately

00:17:29.049 --> 00:17:34.749
fail. We were saying can we uncouple this,
allow SVG to be used in normal HTML and let

00:17:34.749 --> 00:17:40.999
them sort of, you know, fight for their own
merits in that sense. So that was one of the

00:17:40.999 --> 00:17:45.559
other primary things that developers sometimes
wanted to just drop a few tags. They want

00:17:45.559 --> 00:17:49.850
to square with rounded rectangles to make
a button that doesnÃ­t need some crazy way

00:17:49.850 --> 00:17:55.619
to get rounded rectangles that you can just
use a little SVG. So we saw that as the second

00:17:55.619 --> 00:18:05.080
blocker. So our solution for both was a JavaScript
library. Before I kind of take you into that

00:18:05.080 --> 00:18:11.409
and show you some demos, I want to say that
we're not the only ones doing this. There

00:18:11.409 --> 00:18:18.549
are a lot of really amazing toolkits in the
community, they're all speaking at this conference.

00:18:18.549 --> 00:18:22.519
I'm going to run through them really quick.
All of them are taking different approaches

00:18:22.519 --> 00:18:27.490
to give you a consistent way to draw SVG on
all browsers including Internet Explorer.

00:18:27.490 --> 00:18:32.249
And itÃ­s a real testament to the fact that
there's real demand for this and people are

00:18:32.249 --> 00:18:35.779
actually, you know, I call it, you know, "Vote
with your sweat." It's kind of a crazy term,

00:18:35.779 --> 00:18:41.610
but if you believe in something, shift code
and people are, so people think this is important.

00:18:41.610 --> 00:18:47.720
Obviously, the Raphael Library doing really
amazing work. And theyÃ­re speaking today,

00:18:47.720 --> 00:18:54.700
this morning in this room, make sure to catch
that. DojoX, doing some very cool work, they

00:18:54.700 --> 00:18:58.679
have a different pluggable back-in, so you
can have different kinds of renderers and

00:18:58.679 --> 00:19:04.049
it integrates with the rest of the Dojo infrastructure,
so you get Data Abstraction. You can do some

00:19:04.049 --> 00:19:10.519
really cool stuff, again, 12 o'clock today
in this room. And then the Apple SDK, Segay

00:19:10.519 --> 00:19:13.710
Linskey [PH] is doing some very interesting
work in terms of a consistent development

00:19:13.710 --> 00:19:19.299
environment. Again, that's also being talked
about in this room today. So I encourage you

00:19:19.299 --> 00:19:26.860
to check out the work they're doing. So, let's
jump in to what we're involved in. So the

00:19:26.860 --> 00:19:33.590
name of the library is the SVG Web Library.
And what makes this unique is there's nothing

00:19:33.590 --> 00:19:41.769
extra to download. We, you can either say
use or abuse. We use facilities that are already

00:19:41.769 --> 00:19:47.600
present on about 97% percent of the web browsers
out there. So there's nothing for the user

00:19:47.600 --> 00:19:55.740
to download. And we give the illusion of native
SVG support for both static and dynamic SVG

00:19:55.740 --> 00:20:02.519
images. And itÃ­s as easy as dropping a
JavaScript file into your page so that users

00:20:02.519 --> 00:20:09.119
donÃ­t have to download new software, it
just works. So before this toolkit, you have

00:20:09.119 --> 00:20:16.269
roughly about 30% coverage for SVG, that's
essentially adding up the other browsers.

00:20:16.269 --> 00:20:20.639
Once you've got the toolkit, you essentially
have close to 100% of the installed web base,

00:20:20.639 --> 00:20:31.039
probably closer to 95%, but we'll round up
5%, truth in advertising. That's cool because

00:20:31.039 --> 00:20:35.919
that means that as a developer, you donÃ­t
face the chicken and egg problem, you can

00:20:35.919 --> 00:20:44.009
just start using the technology you're interested
in and get stuff done. Now, I want to mention--I've

00:20:44.009 --> 00:20:48.840
done a fair bit of open source, and this has
been a really exciting project. We've got

00:20:48.840 --> 00:20:53.869
more people outside of Google working on this
than inside. We've got Rick Masters who's

00:20:53.869 --> 00:21:01.639
actually here, one of the lead developers.
He'll be actually coming up a little bit later

00:21:01.639 --> 00:21:05.509
in the presentation to show us some cool demos.
We've got James Hight, who does not--he's

00:21:05.509 --> 00:21:13.610
a giant Z. I couldnÃ­t get a picture of
him in time. And we've just got a whole host

00:21:13.610 --> 00:21:19.399
of folks in the community just actively putting
this through its paces. I want to mention

00:21:19.399 --> 00:21:25.590
that we've made a lot of progress with SVG
web. It is an Alpha. This is an Early Access.

00:21:25.590 --> 00:21:28.869
As we continue working with folks as they
put it to its paces, and Sam is using it on

00:21:28.869 --> 00:21:33.409
his blogs. Shelly Powers is using it for some
cool stuff. We'll talk about some of the work

00:21:33.409 --> 00:21:37.739
we're doing with Wikipedia around using this.
We're going to be like open source. We'll

00:21:37.739 --> 00:21:46.049
announce data when it's, you know, actually
3.0 because that's the open source way. So

00:21:46.049 --> 00:21:59.899
let me show you some demos. [PAUSE] So this
is Firefox and this is native SVG. These images

00:21:59.899 --> 00:22:07.450
are from Flicker, weÃ­re seeing, we can
do stuff with the mouse with them. You could

00:22:07.450 --> 00:22:22.259
imagine building a more larger App with photo
pickers and so on.
I should mention that the library works on

00:22:22.259 --> 00:22:31.429
I6, 7, and 8, so we've got complete coverage.
This is I8, if we jump over to IE, we see

00:22:31.429 --> 00:22:46.210
the exact same demo running with the same
fidelity in IE.
And this is not just SVG, there's JavaScript

00:22:46.210 --> 00:22:50.100
that lives in this, the JavaScript thinks
that there's really native support in the

00:22:50.100 --> 00:22:56.460
browser. Let's see another sample. I really
like this one. Shelly Powers put this together

00:22:56.460 --> 00:23:01.600
a few weeks ago. I like it because it's one
of those "gets-real-done" kinds of things.

00:23:01.600 --> 00:23:07.519
So Shelly, she's got a blog and she wants
to put an image in the background. And she

00:23:07.519 --> 00:23:11.860
wants it to scale based on the size of the
browser, straightforward, right? If you use

00:23:11.860 --> 00:23:16.429
a bitmap image, it will get ugly based on
how it is, it will get distorted. She'd loved

00:23:16.429 --> 00:23:20.460
to use SVG in the background, well, now she
can. This--in the background is from the Open

00:23:20.460 --> 00:23:27.960
Clipart Library. As we change the size of
the browser, we get that nice scaling quality

00:23:27.960 --> 00:23:37.080
of SVG. Of course, that's SVG web in the background
doing that. Michael Noitz [PH]--at the end

00:23:37.080 --> 00:23:41.629
of this I'll put up--when he's talking, he's
doing some really cool work with mapping,

00:23:41.629 --> 00:23:48.100
things like that. This is a sample that he
helped port, I think someone wrote the original

00:23:48.100 --> 00:23:53.940
one. What I like about it is it shows a couple
of different things. It actually shows demographics.

00:23:53.940 --> 00:24:01.350
It shows the population of Germany at different
times. And SVG is really good at this. It's

00:24:01.350 --> 00:24:08.419
rich data, you slice and dice. This is directly
integrated into the HTML. The SVG is in normal

00:24:08.419 --> 00:24:15.470
HTML. And we see the HTML updating as we do
it. What makes this really cool is some people

00:24:15.470 --> 00:24:19.309
are like, "You know, why don't you just use
an image? Well, on the fly, we can change

00:24:19.309 --> 00:24:26.029
the language. And we are changing it to Russian
inside of the SVG. Here, we are changing it

00:24:26.029 --> 00:24:35.190
to French. And that's cool. And that depends
on the SVG, again it's just text, so it's

00:24:35.190 --> 00:24:39.279
easy to change the language. It's easy to
make this intelligent, and that's a cool thing.

00:24:39.279 --> 00:24:44.840
I know, Brion is excited about these kinds
of thing. He'll mention some cool things that

00:24:44.840 --> 00:24:54.830
they're doing. You know, SVG and maps go together
like peanut butter and jelly. It's one of

00:24:54.830 --> 00:25:03.539
those classic uses of SVG. Michael Noitz [PH]
will talk about more about this in his talk.

00:25:03.539 --> 00:25:09.409
He's been creating an interactive overview
of the election results for the German election

00:25:09.409 --> 00:25:14.029
that I believe happened last week. It happened
fairly recently, I see all the folks whoa

00:25:14.029 --> 00:25:22.230
re from that area nodding, getting that right.
We see Germany. We can zoom in and out. We

00:25:22.230 --> 00:25:26.369
can pan around. We can slice and dice the
data. Again, this is another good example

00:25:26.369 --> 00:25:31.440
of--SVG is on the left doing what it does
well. HTML on the right directly embedded

00:25:31.440 --> 00:25:41.749
in the page. This is in Safari. And I'll mention--I'm
going to talk a little bit later and more

00:25:41.749 --> 00:25:46.570
in the technical talk in the afternoon, but
SVG web also helps the native browsers actually

00:25:46.570 --> 00:25:50.669
by letting you drop SVG in the normal HTML.
It doesnÃ­t just help IE, it also helps

00:25:50.669 --> 00:25:55.369
you put in the normal HTML. And actually patches
over a couple of bugs too. So it helps the

00:25:55.369 --> 00:26:00.929
native stuff too. So these are also using
SVG web. And then here we are in IE, we can

00:26:00.929 --> 00:26:13.009
still zoom in., we can still slice and dice.
And now this developer can deploy his work

00:26:13.009 --> 00:26:19.149
and know it's going to reach folks. I like
this one. I'm a horrible space geek, don't

00:26:19.149 --> 00:26:25.590
get me started. I'll talk your ear off. Luther
Hoffman put this together. It uses the Google

00:26:25.590 --> 00:26:30.720
Maps API to figure out your latitude and longitude,
and then it generates--we're turning off the

00:26:30.720 --> 00:26:34.080
lights like we're outside. It generates a
star map. These are the stars that we would

00:26:34.080 --> 00:26:43.639
see right above us based on where we are,
and that is generated with SVG. Again, real

00:26:43.639 --> 00:26:48.720
work, getting real stuff done, and this is
running on IE but you almost don't even notice.

00:26:48.720 --> 00:26:52.359
It just works. The user doesnÃ­t really
care what the technology is, it just works

00:26:52.359 --> 00:27:06.820
now. So here's a couple of demos.

00:27:06.820 --> 00:27:15.340
I spoke a little bit about how JavaScript
is tricked. One of the cool things about the

00:27:15.340 --> 00:27:21.129
toolkit is JavaScript that runs in the page
thinks that there's native SVG support. So

00:27:21.129 --> 00:27:28.649
you get things like get on it by ID, creating
an element. And so, one of the slight nuances

00:27:28.649 --> 00:27:34.429
when working with SVG is you have to kind
of give the name space. So you create an element.

00:27:34.429 --> 00:27:40.470
And we actually--we plugged this global variable
"svgns" into the page, because almost everyone

00:27:40.470 --> 00:27:46.369
defines that anyway. So that can make it easier
for people to just start using this. Things

00:27:46.369 --> 00:27:53.919
like style work. So you can grab your circle
from the page. Again, treat it like you do

00:27:53.919 --> 00:28:00.539
HTML, ".style.fill" just works. We support
a huge amount of the "DOM". This--I'm just

00:28:00.539 --> 00:28:04.549
giving you some small representative samples.
You'd be bored if I went through, you know,

00:28:04.549 --> 00:28:13.039
first child, last child, child node. So this
is a few of the--of the methods and, of course,

00:28:13.039 --> 00:28:16.659
event listeners, and including when you're
on IE, when you're dealing with SVG, you can

00:28:16.659 --> 00:28:22.999
use "addEventListener". So the end-result
of this is things just work for the programmer.

00:28:22.999 --> 00:28:29.090
And I--I'm not going to go super deep into
how this is achieved. I don't know if you

00:28:29.090 --> 00:28:35.909
know this picture. This is a famous illustration
from the Apollo-Soyuz "Peace in Space." I

00:28:35.909 --> 00:28:43.239
think 1976, the peace between the superpowers.
Under the covers in SVG web, I like to say

00:28:43.239 --> 00:28:46.460
"Do you want the blue pill or the red pill?"
I don't remember which is which. The blue

00:28:46.460 --> 00:28:51.659
pill is that it just works, you feel like
you got SVG, you have to do some slight finagling

00:28:51.659 --> 00:28:58.850
to accommodate SVG web, but it's pretty minor.
The red pill is--we use Flash to do the rendering

00:28:58.850 --> 00:29:05.499
not--you know, we do it for purely pragmatic
reasons. I'd like to say I'm a pragmatic person

00:29:05.499 --> 00:29:10.149
following ideological goals. We do it because
it's going to be installed where we need it

00:29:10.149 --> 00:29:15.109
on the IE instances. And then we use a technology
called Microsoft Behaviors, which are very

00:29:15.109 --> 00:29:19.320
cool. I've long been a fan of them. They've
been around for a long time. They essentially

00:29:19.320 --> 00:29:24.789
allow you to extend the layout engine of IE
and do some very nifty stuff. And if you're

00:29:24.789 --> 00:29:28.929
into such things, pull me aside. We've installed
some pretty long standing issues with Microsoft

00:29:28.929 --> 00:29:33.210
behaviors to make them much more robust. So
kind of got some--if you're in to JavaScript

00:29:33.210 --> 00:29:38.289
hacking, there are some fun--some fun solutions
we've found. But the end-result is that these

00:29:38.289 --> 00:29:44.830
two things come together and you get the illusion
of native SVG, including like ".style" for

00:29:44.830 --> 00:29:47.909
example, which looks like magic headers and
setters. And I'll touch a little bit more

00:29:47.909 --> 00:29:55.369
on this in the tech talk in the afternoon.
I want to briefly talk about performance.

00:29:55.369 --> 00:30:04.529
SVG web is--it's not a get-out-of-jail free
card for IE. We--it would be great to have

00:30:04.529 --> 00:30:12.789
SVG in IE9. The--the library will always be
slower than native support, by definition

00:30:12.789 --> 00:30:17.210
as a JavaScript library. And we've made some
amazing progress where we can power some really

00:30:17.210 --> 00:30:20.729
cool things, but we'll always hit an upper
ceiling. We're just a JavaScript toolkit.

00:30:20.729 --> 00:30:26.460
So we can help carry the ball for a little
bit, but the native implementations will always

00:30:26.460 --> 00:30:31.669
be vastly faster. And this is only going to
enable users to interact with SVG content,

00:30:31.669 --> 00:30:39.710
but it will not match the performance of a
native implementation. So--let me show you

00:30:39.710 --> 00:30:51.970
some more demos. [PAUSE] Oh, you just saw
the more demos. I did those in the wrong order.

00:30:51.970 --> 00:30:57.019
And I also wanted to point out Michael Noitz
[PH], who is our--the demographic one and

00:30:57.019 --> 00:31:00.659
the map example. He's going to be going deeper
into the work he's doing. He's been a great

00:31:00.659 --> 00:31:09.039
member of the community, tomorrow in the other
room, Maxwell Tech Talk. I want to just briefly

00:31:09.039 --> 00:31:13.200
touch on how a developer works with this.
And if you're interested in this, come to

00:31:13.200 --> 00:31:17.220
the Tech Talk. I'm going to be essentially
taking you through all the steps to get going

00:31:17.220 --> 00:31:22.889
with SVG web. But you've got two ways to embed
into the page. You can use the object tag,

00:31:22.889 --> 00:31:28.389
which will also work on IE. We have that working
on IE. And you just say, "This is SVG." And

00:31:28.389 --> 00:31:33.989
then you set data equal to "Here's what I
actually want to show." Or you can directly

00:31:33.989 --> 00:31:38.549
embed into the page. Now, we do something
that's interesting. Let me--let me take you

00:31:38.549 --> 00:31:45.799
through this page. This is an HTML5 page.
That's the HTML5 doc type at the top. HTML5

00:31:45.799 --> 00:31:50.279
gives you two ways to embed XML-like data.
The first one is you actually can put it into

00:31:50.279 --> 00:31:56.859
a script tag and set to mime-type. The second
one is SVG becomes a native tag. You just

00:31:56.859 --> 00:32:02.919
say "SVG" and you drop it in. We currently
support the first one for a variety of reasons

00:32:02.919 --> 00:32:07.580
in terms of reliability. And that's what you're
seeing here. We will eventually like to support

00:32:07.580 --> 00:32:12.239
the second version, but there are some tricky
engineering issues. But the nice thing about

00:32:12.239 --> 00:32:18.799
this version is you can drop pure unadulterated
SVG right into a normal HTML page. And so

00:32:18.799 --> 00:32:22.799
right here, we see that right there. You see
a rectangle. I'm sure everyone here knows.

00:32:22.799 --> 00:32:27.549
You've seen this kind of things, setting where
it is, setting its fill. You know what I love?

00:32:27.549 --> 00:32:32.179
I didn't put it in this. But if I put "rx"
and "ry", that rounds the corners. And I like

00:32:32.179 --> 00:32:37.359
to say "rounded rectangles, I love." In 2009,
we're still waiting for rounded rectangles.

00:32:37.359 --> 00:32:46.409
Well, there you go. You got some rounded rectangles
there, didn't have to break a sweat. So I'd

00:32:46.409 --> 00:32:51.059
like to invite up Brion Vibber, who is doing
some really cool work at Wikipedia. I'm going

00:32:51.059 --> 00:32:54.759
to show a demo of some of the stuff we've
been doing with him after he comes up. But

00:32:54.759 --> 00:32:58.779
Brion is the CTO of Wikimedia. It is a real
pleasure to have him here. It's a really big

00:32:58.779 --> 00:33:02.509
booster of SVG.

00:33:02.509 --> 00:33:10.049
&gt;&gt; VIBBER: Hi there, everybody. So you probably
heard of Wikipedia before. It's, you know,

00:33:10.049 --> 00:33:15.859
people do use it on the Internet. It's a pretty
cool site, as I hope you all think. If you

00:33:15.859 --> 00:33:24.259
don't, then--well, that's very sad. But anyway,
we basically do three main things at Wikipedia

00:33:24.259 --> 00:33:31.830
and our other sites of Wikimedia foundation,
which is, first, to build educational and

00:33:31.830 --> 00:33:37.729
reference materials on the web. Second, to
make those freely available under open-content

00:33:37.729 --> 00:33:44.999
licenses, and third, to build them collaboratively
on that wacky Internet, which is really the

00:33:44.999 --> 00:33:50.309
most important part where SVG comes into play.
We've been using SVG very heavily on Wikipedia

00:33:50.309 --> 00:33:57.399
and Wikimedia comments for the last few years,
because it gives us a standard format for

00:33:57.399 --> 00:34:02.919
graphics, which can be edited by multiple
people over time with no, you know, lousiness

00:34:02.919 --> 00:34:09.360
or having to start over or having to find
a, you know, very expensive tool such as Adobe

00:34:09.360 --> 00:34:14.919
Illustrator. There are free offering tools
that are cross-platformed for SVG. And that

00:34:14.919 --> 00:34:23.400
has enabled people to create all kinds of
maps, graphics, icons, diagrams, charts, a

00:34:23.400 --> 00:34:27.570
huge portion of the graphics that you see
on Wikipedia are on the back-end built with

00:34:27.570 --> 00:34:33.610
SVG. But, traditionally, most of that action
for us has been on the desktop side, because

00:34:33.610 --> 00:34:39.950
the browser support just wasn't quite there.
In the last couple of years, we've seen SVG

00:34:39.950 --> 00:34:44.860
support come pretty well up to snuff on every
browser except IE. And so, I'm keeping my

00:34:44.860 --> 00:34:49.440
fingers crossed for IE9. But we've had, you
know, kind of a big gap where something like

00:34:49.440 --> 00:34:56.659
two-thirds, 70% of our viewers just would
not be able to use native SVG in a browser,

00:34:56.659 --> 00:35:01.640
which has meant that we haven't been able
to do anything dynamic. We basically have

00:35:01.640 --> 00:35:08.300
static images that sit there in your browser.
You know, we actually restorize them in order

00:35:08.300 --> 00:35:15.240
to make them most widely available. But there
are so many amazing things that SVG promises

00:35:15.240 --> 00:35:19.930
when you actually put it right in the browser.
You can create interactive tools, such as

00:35:19.930 --> 00:35:25.670
the maps that Brad was showing earlier, which
would be hugely valuable for a site like Wikipedia,

00:35:25.670 --> 00:35:32.650
building an interactive tool where you can
really explore, you know, the data that exists.

00:35:32.650 --> 00:35:38.140
Being able to, you know, switch in multiple
versions, different data sets. You can create

00:35:38.140 --> 00:35:45.760
a far more compelling educational experience
than, you know, any static image you can create.

00:35:45.760 --> 00:35:51.930
Plus, of course, our other goal is that we're
building things on the Internet interactively

00:35:51.930 --> 00:35:58.510
collaboratively with multiple people. And
any time that we require people to download

00:35:58.510 --> 00:36:03.640
a program to their computer, that is a barrier.
Even if it's available for every operating

00:36:03.640 --> 00:36:08.590
system, it is a barrier to entry and it makes
it harder to use. If we can put it in the

00:36:08.590 --> 00:36:14.960
browser, bam, suddenly, it's a billion times
easier. We can do, you know, native editing,

00:36:14.960 --> 00:36:19.380
you know, where you're moving things around
right there in your browser. We can enable

00:36:19.380 --> 00:36:25.920
localization, and support of multiple languages
has always been one of our, you know, most

00:36:25.920 --> 00:36:32.570
important things. Wikipedia is available in
200 something languages a lot. I always forget

00:36:32.570 --> 00:36:39.680
the number, because it's just too big. But,
you know, being able to create a chart once

00:36:39.680 --> 00:36:45.350
and then fill in all those localized strings,
all those localized names make that available

00:36:45.350 --> 00:36:51.290
natively for every language, wow. I mean we
really, really want to do that, but we've

00:36:51.290 --> 00:36:55.940
never been able to do it because, you know,
it's just not going to be available for 70%

00:36:55.940 --> 00:37:01.960
of our users. With SVG web, suddenly that
gap is actually going to be filled. And until

00:37:01.960 --> 00:37:08.110
we have a real native support in IE, we have
something that's almost as good. And that's

00:37:08.110 --> 00:37:16.350
going to enable us to really make the SVG
experience as it were insanely better. So

00:37:16.350 --> 00:37:20.070
I'm really happy about that.

00:37:20.070 --> 00:37:26.860
&gt;&gt; NEUBERG: Thank you so much, Brion. It's
cool. It's really, really fun to be working

00:37:26.860 --> 00:37:29.720
with Wikipedia, itÃ­s like, Ã¬Oh, Mark
from Wikipedia,Ã® itÃ­s like; I'm a Wiki

00:37:29.720 --> 00:37:37.380
geek, so itÃ­s like the Mecca of Wikis.
I want to show you some of the work weÃ­ve

00:37:37.380 --> 00:37:41.790
been doing with Wikipedia. One of the things
most people don't know is that they had this

00:37:41.790 --> 00:37:47.780
amazing resource called the Wikipedia Comments.
Every image, video, SVG file, ends up on the

00:37:47.780 --> 00:37:52.040
comments there, itÃ­s free called, sure,
they're creative comments licensed, and you

00:37:52.040 --> 00:37:57.210
can work with them. I want to show you a prototype
that weÃ­ve been building with them. That

00:37:57.210 --> 00:38:05.160
allows you to not just sort of see the SVG
image on the comments. Here we are, seeing

00:38:05.160 --> 00:38:12.010
the Wikimedia Comments logo, but you can actually
begin to interact with it, and take advantage

00:38:12.010 --> 00:38:26.760
of the scaleable nature. So, we can pan around,
zoom in and out. We get Google map style controls

00:38:26.760 --> 00:38:44.740
and the cool thing is we come over to IE and
there we go.
So, youÃ­ll be seeing more of this, you

00:38:44.740 --> 00:38:48.540
know, we were work in the QA and move this
forward but expect to see this at some point

00:38:48.540 --> 00:38:51.980
in the Wikimedia comments, itÃ­s a prototype
right now. And itÃ­s just a real honor;

00:38:51.980 --> 00:38:58.550
itÃ­s very exciting to be working with you
guys. And there are--Brion himself is speaking

00:38:58.550 --> 00:39:04.300
this Sunday, in this room, if you want to
go deeper into the work theyÃ­re doing.

00:39:04.300 --> 00:39:09.240
And theyÃ­re always looking for volunteers,
doing all sorts of very cool work around this,

00:39:09.240 --> 00:39:14.350
definitely see his talk. And I want to invite
one more person up on stage, Rick Masters

00:39:14.350 --> 00:39:21.040
is one of the leads of SVG web, he literally,
he saved my butt on this project. The stuff

00:39:21.040 --> 00:39:26.040
that he's done is amazing, I remember, you
know, we had originally, we were just going

00:39:26.040 --> 00:39:30.670
to hit, much of SVG 1.1 and there were a lot
of things we couldnÃ­t hit. I remember I

00:39:30.670 --> 00:39:35.460
woke up one Monday morning and it was like,
Ã¬Oh, hey, I did SVG fonts over the weekend.Ã®

00:39:35.460 --> 00:39:39.440
You know, and then IÃ­ll show up, Ã¬Oh,
hey, I just checked in a partial Smile implementation.Ã®

00:39:39.440 --> 00:39:44.050
So, all sorts of cool stuff and I--heÃ­s
actually the senior architect at F5 networks

00:39:44.050 --> 00:39:51.270
and I want to invite him up on stage to show
us some quick demos of--some other cool SVG

00:39:51.270 --> 00:45:02.280
web stuff. [PAUSE] Okay. Let me plug-in this
now, okay.
