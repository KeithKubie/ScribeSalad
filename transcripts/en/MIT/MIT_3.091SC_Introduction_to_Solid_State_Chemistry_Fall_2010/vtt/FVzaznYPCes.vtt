00:00:21.440 --> 00:00:23.470
PROFESSOR: OK, Let's get
down to business.

00:00:23.470 --> 00:00:26.890
Last day we started study
crystallography.

00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:29.300
And we were looking
at ordered solids.

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:32.990
And we recognized the crystal
structure is the sum of the

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:36.880
combination of a Bravais
lattice, which is the way that

00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:40.650
points are identified in
space, plus the basis.

00:00:40.650 --> 00:00:44.670
And we saw that we could put a
variety of elements at the

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:46.950
corners of the Bravais
lattice.

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:49.800
And this is taken from the
archival notes where we see

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:54.220
the simple, single atoms at the
various lattice points.

00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:58.070
And we recognized last day that
we could put clusters of

00:00:58.070 --> 00:01:00.370
atoms and so on, and
even proteins will

00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:01.580
crystallize in this form.

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:05.650
And actually, to make a point,
about five years ago, a group

00:01:05.650 --> 00:01:09.110
of students came to my office
after the final exam, and

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:13.740
recognizing that I drink Fresca
during the lectures,

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:15.590
they came to me with this

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:19.610
body-centered Fresca unit cell.

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:24.570
So this just makes the point
that you can put anything at

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:25.310
the lattice point.

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:29.260
So there it is.

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:30.400
Oh, here's the point.

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:33.120
This is me at a conference
in Copenhagen.

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:35.480
This is outside the
Admiral Hotel.

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:38.370
And just to show you I'm always
thinking about 3.091, I

00:01:38.370 --> 00:01:40.400
came outside--

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:42.500
and this is a colleague of mine
from France, Marcelle

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:43.620
Gaune-Escard.

00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:45.150
How do we know she's French?

00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:47.330
She's got a cigarette.

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:48.950
She's a scientist.
She's a woman.

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:49.850
And she smoking.

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:50.720
And it's fantastic.

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:52.290
And she's a great gal.

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:55.330
Anyways, so there we are out in
front of the Admiral Hotel.

00:01:55.330 --> 00:01:56.990
And I notice these
cannon balls.

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:59.050
And what do you notice about
the cannon balls?

00:01:59.050 --> 00:02:02.420
They are sitting in one of
the Bravais lattices.

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:04.970
So I couldn't resist having
my wife take this picture.

00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:08.240
Because I knew that this would
come back to 3.091.

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:13.690
So here we are with the
individual cubic lattices

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:15.040
where we're going to focus.

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:18.190
And we started looking at the
properties of cubic lattices.

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:22.620
And I started working
through this table.

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:26.140
And we got down to nearest
neighbors, and so on, and this

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:28.260
relationship between
the lattice

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:29.770
constant and the radius.

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:32.320
And I just wanted to show
this last point here

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:33.580
about packing density.

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:40.340
Because it comes up
considerations of properties

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:41.460
of elements.

00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:43.570
And so I wanted to go through
the packing density

00:02:43.570 --> 00:02:44.770
calculation.

00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:47.570
And so the way we handle the
packing density, remember

00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:49.890
we're looking at a
unit cell here.

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:52.820
This is the cube that's
the repeat unit.

00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:55.870
And it has a lattice constant
of dimension a.

00:02:55.870 --> 00:02:59.000
And then depending on where we
put atoms, I want to show that

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:02.040
we've got three different
options here, simple cubic,

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:04.350
body-centered cubic, and
face-centered cubic.

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:07.870
And the last line of that slide
shows that the densest

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:09.555
packing of atoms-- this is hard

00:03:09.555 --> 00:03:11.490
spheres, the cannon balls--

00:03:11.490 --> 00:03:13.450
the densest packing is
face-centered cubic.

00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:16.760
And I wanted to show the
derivation of that where if we

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:19.940
face-centered cubic where the
atoms are big enough to touch.

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:23.310
If we have 4 atoms at the corner
touching on the face

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:26.950
diagonal and then continuing
through the cell, we want to

00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:34.680
get packing density as the ratio
of the volume occupied

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:36.640
by the atoms-- and here
we're modeling the

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:38.240
atoms as hard spheres--

00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:41.610
divided by the volume
of the cell itself.

00:03:41.610 --> 00:03:44.680
And so that's pretty
straightforward calculation.

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:47.290
We're modeling the atoms
as hard spheres.

00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:51.570
And we saw last day that if we
take the fraction of the atom,

00:03:51.570 --> 00:03:55.970
1/8 times 1/8, and 6 times
1/2, we have 4 atom

00:03:55.970 --> 00:03:57.510
equivalents per unit cell.

00:03:57.510 --> 00:04:01.910
And each of these has a volume
of 4/3 pi r cubed.

00:04:01.910 --> 00:04:04.360
And then we divide
that by a cubed.

00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:07.460
And then we know the
relationship between a and r.

00:04:07.460 --> 00:04:09.540
This is 4r and that's
root 2 a.

00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:13.260
So we can say root
2 a equals 4r.

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:15.800
Either eliminate a
or eliminate r.

00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:18.310
We eventually end up with this
dimensionless group, which is

00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:21.510
pi divided by 3 roots of 2.

00:04:21.510 --> 00:04:25.040
And that is 74%.

00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:26.405
And that's the densest
package.

00:04:26.405 --> 00:04:28.740
If you go through the same
calculation for body-centered

00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:32.160
packing, you'll find
it's 68% packing.

00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:35.120
And for simple cubic
it's 52% packing.

00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:39.130
That's the highest density that
you can have. So I urge

00:04:39.130 --> 00:04:40.140
you to spend some time.

00:04:40.140 --> 00:04:42.900
If you work the homework, you'll
work your way through

00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:44.110
that chart.

00:04:44.110 --> 00:04:47.130
So now I wanted to take a few
minutes and talk about

00:04:47.130 --> 00:04:48.660
crystallographic notation.

00:04:48.660 --> 00:04:52.040
Because we need to know this in
order to describe various

00:04:52.040 --> 00:04:53.060
features of a cell.

00:04:53.060 --> 00:04:57.950
So I'm going to start with a
Cartesian coordinate system

00:04:57.950 --> 00:04:59.600
that obeys the right-hand
rule.

00:04:59.600 --> 00:05:02.310
So we'll put down x, y and z.

00:05:02.310 --> 00:05:07.010
And then we'll put up a unit
cell here with edge a.

00:05:07.010 --> 00:05:12.280
So we have a on the x,
y and z coordinate.

00:05:12.280 --> 00:05:16.010
And we know that a equals
b equals c.

00:05:16.010 --> 00:05:17.420
That's the unit vectors here.

00:05:17.420 --> 00:05:19.810
There's a little a here,
a little b here,

00:05:19.810 --> 00:05:20.970
and a little c here.

00:05:20.970 --> 00:05:25.160
These are all equal to the
lattice constant value a.

00:05:25.160 --> 00:05:27.240
And all of the angles
are 90 degrees.

00:05:27.240 --> 00:05:29.430
This is what defines
the cubic system.

00:05:29.430 --> 00:05:32.150
So I'm going to put several
positions here.

00:05:32.150 --> 00:05:34.150
So here is the origin.

00:05:34.150 --> 00:05:38.710
And the origin we designate
as 0, 0, 0.

00:05:38.710 --> 00:05:41.170
I'm going to put a position
up here, a.

00:05:41.170 --> 00:05:44.050
And you just use the same
notation as you'd use

00:05:44.050 --> 00:05:44.810
mathematics.

00:05:44.810 --> 00:05:48.150
Only crystallographers don't
put parentheses around it.

00:05:48.150 --> 00:05:49.990
So what I'm really teaching
is notation.

00:05:49.990 --> 00:05:51.630
You already know the math.

00:05:51.630 --> 00:05:54.230
So a up here is what?

00:05:54.230 --> 00:05:56.130
It's 0 units on the x-axis.

00:05:56.130 --> 00:05:59.150
It's 1 unit on the y-axis,
and 1 unit on a z-axis.

00:05:59.150 --> 00:06:01.820
So that would make it 0, 1, 1.

00:06:01.820 --> 00:06:04.550
And I'm going to put
a b out here.

00:06:04.550 --> 00:06:07.700
B is out 1 unit on the x-axis.

00:06:07.700 --> 00:06:10.350
It's 0 units on the y-axis.

00:06:10.350 --> 00:06:14.890
And it looks like it's up at
about 1/2 unit on the z-axis.

00:06:14.890 --> 00:06:18.390
So that makes 1, 0, and 1/2.

00:06:18.390 --> 00:06:21.810
And so now what I want to do is
show you how we designate

00:06:21.810 --> 00:06:24.275
directions and planes.

00:06:24.275 --> 00:06:26.690
You use a slightly different
notation from what

00:06:26.690 --> 00:06:27.910
you used to in math.

00:06:27.910 --> 00:06:31.650
So this chart will be posted
at the website.

00:06:31.650 --> 00:06:34.480
Move the coordinate axes so the
line passes through the

00:06:34.480 --> 00:06:38.400
origin, define a vector from the
origin to the point on the

00:06:38.400 --> 00:06:40.580
line, and choose the smaller
set of integers.

00:06:40.580 --> 00:06:42.440
So let's do a simple one here.

00:06:42.440 --> 00:06:46.020
Let's do from origin to b.

00:06:46.020 --> 00:06:47.720
So o to b.

00:06:47.720 --> 00:06:49.500
That's this vector here.

00:06:49.500 --> 00:06:50.620
So how would we do that one?

00:06:50.620 --> 00:06:52.640
Well we're already
at the origin.

00:06:52.640 --> 00:06:53.310
So that's trivial.

00:06:53.310 --> 00:06:56.410
o to b, so we're going from
here out to here.

00:06:56.410 --> 00:06:57.820
And then what does it say?

00:06:57.820 --> 00:07:02.140
It says choose the smallest set
of integers, no commas,

00:07:02.140 --> 00:07:03.100
clear fractions.

00:07:03.100 --> 00:07:06.980
So that's going to take
us out to 1 0 1/2.

00:07:06.980 --> 00:07:09.725
But the crystallographers
don't like fractions.

00:07:09.725 --> 00:07:11.610
So you're supposed to
clear the fractions.

00:07:11.610 --> 00:07:14.140
You clear the fractions by
multiplying through.

00:07:14.140 --> 00:07:17.410
So make that 2 0 1.

00:07:17.410 --> 00:07:18.650
It's the same direction.

00:07:18.650 --> 00:07:20.980
See if I came out two units
here, I'd end up

00:07:20.980 --> 00:07:21.970
being one unit here.

00:07:21.970 --> 00:07:24.850
So it's the same direction.

00:07:24.850 --> 00:07:26.400
It really is the
same direction.

00:07:26.400 --> 00:07:27.780
Don't put any commas.

00:07:27.780 --> 00:07:29.090
And put brackets around it.

00:07:29.090 --> 00:07:33.640
So that's the 2, 0, 1 direction,
which is o b.

00:07:33.640 --> 00:07:34.800
And I want to do a
different one.

00:07:34.800 --> 00:07:37.690
I'm going to go this
way, a to o.

00:07:37.690 --> 00:07:41.240
So let's look at
that one, a o.

00:07:41.240 --> 00:07:42.620
And what happens on a o?

00:07:42.620 --> 00:07:44.720
Well now I'm going to
put the origin at a.

00:07:44.720 --> 00:07:48.590
I'm going to go to
0 in the x-axis.

00:07:48.590 --> 00:07:51.350
I'm going to go minus
1 in the z-axis, and

00:07:51.350 --> 00:07:52.790
minus 1 in the y-axis.

00:07:52.790 --> 00:07:56.510
So that gives me 0
minus 1 minus 1.

00:07:56.510 --> 00:07:58.290
But see they don't use commas.

00:07:58.290 --> 00:07:59.940
And so this looks
kind of goofy.

00:07:59.940 --> 00:08:01.440
Because you get these
minus signs in here.

00:08:01.440 --> 00:08:04.090
So what the crystallographers do
is they put the minus sign

00:08:04.090 --> 00:08:05.340
on top of the number.

00:08:05.340 --> 00:08:09.000
So this becomes 0 1
with a macron it.

00:08:11.530 --> 00:08:14.780
If you'd studied Latin, you'd
know this thing is a macron, a

00:08:14.780 --> 00:08:16.800
line over a vowel.

00:08:16.800 --> 00:08:19.490
So 0 1 bar 1 bar.

00:08:19.490 --> 00:08:21.760
And that's the direction a o.

00:08:21.760 --> 00:08:25.430
So that's the macron acting
as the minus sign.

00:08:25.430 --> 00:08:28.790
So that's the a o direction

00:08:28.790 --> 00:08:32.200
And then furthermore, we
can designate families.

00:08:32.200 --> 00:08:35.780
This is just the
0 1 bar 1 bar.

00:08:35.780 --> 00:08:38.200
If you want to be a hipster
with crystallography,

00:08:38.200 --> 00:08:39.380
you call this 0.

00:08:39.380 --> 00:08:41.870
You say it's 0 1 bar 1 bar.

00:08:41.870 --> 00:08:44.690
But if you're a nice chemistry
student, you'll say zero,

00:08:44.690 --> 00:08:46.510
minus 1 minus 1.

00:08:46.510 --> 00:08:49.710
No we don't do that in
3.091, 0 1 bar 1 bar.

00:08:49.710 --> 00:08:54.250
Now suppose I wanted to describe
all of the faces,

00:08:54.250 --> 00:08:55.560
every face.

00:08:55.560 --> 00:08:58.210
So what I could do, is I
could say I want the

00:08:58.210 --> 00:09:02.158
set of all face diagonals.

00:09:05.750 --> 00:09:07.480
Well, that's a face diagonal.

00:09:07.480 --> 00:09:11.200
But what I can do is in a
compact notation, I could

00:09:11.200 --> 00:09:17.180
write 0 1 1 and use the carat.

00:09:17.180 --> 00:09:20.300
This is called the carat.

00:09:20.300 --> 00:09:24.560
So if I enclose in carats, this
means the set up all 0 1

00:09:24.560 --> 00:09:26.410
1 type planes.

00:09:26.410 --> 00:09:30.320
And so what that means is I can
unpack that, and write 0 1

00:09:30.320 --> 00:09:37.790
1, 0 1 1 bar, 0 1 bar
1, et cetera.

00:09:37.790 --> 00:09:40.420
And what I'll end up doing
is describing the

00:09:40.420 --> 00:09:42.780
set up all face diagonals.

00:09:42.780 --> 00:09:45.470
So if I want to talk to you
later when we're studying

00:09:45.470 --> 00:09:48.600
x-ray diffraction, I want to
talk about face diagonals, I

00:09:48.600 --> 00:09:49.530
don't use that word.

00:09:49.530 --> 00:09:50.950
We're quantitative
here at MIT.

00:09:50.950 --> 00:09:53.970
I say look at the
0 1 1 planes.

00:09:53.970 --> 00:09:55.780
So you go face diagonals.

00:09:55.780 --> 00:09:57.850
That's the compact notation.

00:09:57.850 --> 00:10:05.130
If we want to look at all cell
edges, what's the cell edge?

00:10:05.130 --> 00:10:07.090
Here's the cell edge.

00:10:07.090 --> 00:10:08.910
This is an edge here,
isn't it?

00:10:08.910 --> 00:10:10.060
It's right on the edge
of the cell.

00:10:10.060 --> 00:10:12.880
So it's 0 on the
y, 0 in the z.

00:10:12.880 --> 00:10:14.290
It's 1 in the x.

00:10:14.290 --> 00:10:19.620
So the set of all cell
edges would be 0 0 1.

00:10:19.620 --> 00:10:22.210
And you could write 1
0 0, that's OK too.

00:10:22.210 --> 00:10:23.540
Or you could write 0 1 0.

00:10:23.540 --> 00:10:24.460
That's OK.

00:10:24.460 --> 00:10:27.050
But if you want to be a hipster
in crystallography,

00:10:27.050 --> 00:10:28.710
put the zeroes out in front.

00:10:28.710 --> 00:10:33.710
So the set of 0 0 1 directions
is all the cube edges.

00:10:33.710 --> 00:10:37.400
And then lastly, if we wanted to
get all the diagonals that

00:10:37.400 --> 00:10:42.540
starts from here and goes up,
we'll have all cell diagonals,

00:10:42.540 --> 00:10:45.430
all, if you want to call it,
body diagonals, not face

00:10:45.430 --> 00:10:48.890
diagonals, body diagonals.

00:10:48.890 --> 00:10:51.250
Body diagonals is 1 1 1.

00:10:51.250 --> 00:10:53.130
And the mathematics
imitates reality.

00:10:53.130 --> 00:10:55.240
How many combinations
are there here?

00:10:55.240 --> 00:10:58.380
I've got 0 1, and I've
got minus 1.

00:10:58.380 --> 00:11:03.510
So I have 0 0 1, 0 0 1 bar,
0 1 0, 0 1 bar 0,

00:11:03.510 --> 00:11:04.695
1 0 0, 1 bar 0.

00:11:04.695 --> 00:11:07.020
There's 6 And how many
edges are there?

00:11:07.020 --> 00:11:08.070
6.

00:11:08.070 --> 00:11:10.990
Mathematics imitating reality,
what a concept.

00:11:10.990 --> 00:11:11.930
That's great.

00:11:11.930 --> 00:11:12.870
OK.

00:11:12.870 --> 00:11:13.510
So that's good.

00:11:13.510 --> 00:11:15.630
Now we want to look at planes.

00:11:15.630 --> 00:11:17.010
Let's look at planes.

00:11:17.010 --> 00:11:18.550
Now planes are a little
bit different.

00:11:18.550 --> 00:11:21.250
This is basically what you know
from math with a little

00:11:21.250 --> 00:11:24.600
bit of notation It's basically
the same thing.

00:11:24.600 --> 00:11:25.700
Planes are quite different.

00:11:25.700 --> 00:11:27.540
So let's go to the planes.

00:11:27.540 --> 00:11:29.170
So you know the equation
of a plane.

00:11:29.170 --> 00:11:34.870
It's x over a plus y over b
plus z over c equals 1.

00:11:34.870 --> 00:11:39.530
And a b and c are the intercepts
at the x, y z axes.

00:11:39.530 --> 00:11:44.950
Well, in order to make this
notation compatible to what we

00:11:44.950 --> 00:11:48.430
have here for lines, a British
meteorologist by the name of

00:11:48.430 --> 00:11:53.550
William Hallowes Miller in 1839
said let's define h, k,

00:11:53.550 --> 00:11:56.880
and l as the reciprocals
of these intercepts.

00:11:56.880 --> 00:12:01.960
And now we'll write the equation
of a plane as hx plus

00:12:01.960 --> 00:12:04.580
ky plus lz equals 1.

00:12:04.580 --> 00:12:09.440
And we'll use those values of h,
k, and l as the indicators

00:12:09.440 --> 00:12:09.940
of a plane.

00:12:09.940 --> 00:12:12.640
So here's an example.

00:12:12.640 --> 00:12:17.110
So again, I've got the
right-handed rule coordinates.

00:12:17.110 --> 00:12:18.550
And here's the plane.

00:12:18.550 --> 00:12:21.360
And you can see that it
cuts the x-axis and a.

00:12:21.360 --> 00:12:23.310
It cuts the y-axis at b.

00:12:23.310 --> 00:12:24.710
And it's parallel
to the z-axis.

00:12:27.840 --> 00:12:30.810
So if we were just to use the
old mathematics notation, and

00:12:30.810 --> 00:12:34.350
put the a, b and c, you'd
have 1/2 here.

00:12:34.350 --> 00:12:35.220
You'd have 1 here.

00:12:35.220 --> 00:12:36.420
And you'd have infinity here.

00:12:36.420 --> 00:12:38.080
And that looks goofy.

00:12:38.080 --> 00:12:41.150
So instead what we want to do
is use the Miller indices,

00:12:41.150 --> 00:12:43.170
which are the reciprocals.

00:12:43.170 --> 00:12:46.150
So now the reciprocal
of 1/2 is 2.

00:12:46.150 --> 00:12:48.330
The reciprocal of 1
trivially is 1.

00:12:48.330 --> 00:12:51.100
And the reciprocal
of infinity is 0.

00:12:51.100 --> 00:12:53.060
And so now you have something
that makes sense.

00:12:53.060 --> 00:12:55.430
And you put no commas
in between.

00:12:55.430 --> 00:12:57.800
And you put the whole thing
in parentheses.

00:12:57.800 --> 00:13:01.110
So that's the 2 1 0 plane.

00:13:01.110 --> 00:13:03.430
And there's a really
cool property here.

00:13:03.430 --> 00:13:07.810
And that is, using this same
formulation I just showed you

00:13:07.810 --> 00:13:11.560
for directions, the 2 1 0
directions-- you see 2 1 0

00:13:11.560 --> 00:13:13.880
with square brackets,
that's a direction.

00:13:13.880 --> 00:13:16.140
2 1 0 with parentheses
is a plane.

00:13:16.140 --> 00:13:19.390
The 2 1 0 direction
is perpendicular

00:13:19.390 --> 00:13:21.320
to the 2 1 0 plane.

00:13:21.320 --> 00:13:23.430
And that's one of the advantages
of using Miller

00:13:23.430 --> 00:13:26.030
indices notation with
the classical

00:13:26.030 --> 00:13:28.710
notation for direction.

00:13:28.710 --> 00:13:29.460
Here's another one.

00:13:29.460 --> 00:13:31.120
This is 0 1 0.

00:13:31.120 --> 00:13:33.150
This is the x, y, and the z.

00:13:33.150 --> 00:13:35.760
So this cuts at 1, 0 1 0.

00:13:35.760 --> 00:13:38.230
This is 0 2 0.

00:13:38.230 --> 00:13:41.580
An 0 1 0 directions are
perpendicular to 0 1 0 plane.

00:13:41.580 --> 00:13:45.100
0 2 0 directions are
perpendicular to 0 2 0 plane.

00:13:45.100 --> 00:13:47.520
Oh here's 1 1 1.

00:13:47.520 --> 00:13:48.020
That's cool.

00:13:48.020 --> 00:13:50.690
See it cuts it at 1 1 and 1.

00:13:50.690 --> 00:13:55.730
And 1 1 1 direction cuts
through the 1 1 1 plane

00:13:55.730 --> 00:13:57.830
perpendicular.

00:13:57.830 --> 00:13:58.850
This is an interesting one.

00:13:58.850 --> 00:14:00.290
See the origin.

00:14:00.290 --> 00:14:01.940
The plane cuts through
the origin.

00:14:01.940 --> 00:14:03.740
Now what do you do?

00:14:03.740 --> 00:14:04.780
What do you do?

00:14:04.780 --> 00:14:08.000
You move the origin.

00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:09.900
Because we don't know where the
origin of the universe is.

00:14:09.900 --> 00:14:10.840
It's just a unit cell.

00:14:10.840 --> 00:14:11.360
It doesn't matter.

00:14:11.360 --> 00:14:12.645
So we move the origin up here.

00:14:12.645 --> 00:14:13.760
And now what do we have?

00:14:13.760 --> 00:14:16.420
We have 1 1 and minus 1.

00:14:16.420 --> 00:14:19.250
And just as before, we put
1 with a macron over it.

00:14:19.250 --> 00:14:21.490
That's 1 1 1 bar plane.

00:14:21.490 --> 00:14:23.860
And there is the 1 1
1 bar direction.

00:14:23.860 --> 00:14:24.700
It doesn't matter.

00:14:24.700 --> 00:14:27.920
It'll always give you
perpendicular.

00:14:27.920 --> 00:14:29.810
It's really cool.

00:14:29.810 --> 00:14:30.420
All right.

00:14:30.420 --> 00:14:33.340
And we can also specify
a set of planes.

00:14:33.340 --> 00:14:35.360
So instead of using
parentheses,

00:14:35.360 --> 00:14:36.700
we use brace brackets.

00:14:36.700 --> 00:14:40.080
And if we use brae brackets,
we get families of planes.

00:14:40.080 --> 00:14:45.000
So for example, we could say if
we wanted a particular face

00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:54.170
so that the face in the xy
plane, facing the xy plane

00:14:54.170 --> 00:14:55.720
would be 0 0 1.

00:14:55.720 --> 00:14:57.400
Right, because it cuts the z.

00:14:57.400 --> 00:14:58.610
So this is 0 0 1.

00:14:58.610 --> 00:15:02.360
But what if I wanted to say in
a compact way, all faces of

00:15:02.360 --> 00:15:04.710
the unit cell, all
of the faces.

00:15:04.710 --> 00:15:06.450
So this is the particular
plane.

00:15:06.450 --> 00:15:11.665
If I wanted to say all faces
I would write 0 0 1.

00:15:11.665 --> 00:15:15.005
But I can't use any of
these containers.

00:15:15.005 --> 00:15:16.560
So I'll use brace brackets.

00:15:16.560 --> 00:15:21.140
So 0 0 1 in brace brackets means
the whole setup, 0 0 1,

00:15:21.140 --> 00:15:30.950
0 0 1 bar, 0 1 0, 0 1 bar
0, 1 0 0, and 1 bar 0 0.

00:15:30.950 --> 00:15:32.040
So there's only 6.

00:15:32.040 --> 00:15:33.270
And there's 6 faces.

00:15:33.270 --> 00:15:36.200
Again mathematics imitating
reality.

00:15:36.200 --> 00:15:36.960
What a concept.

00:15:36.960 --> 00:15:38.140
Make the math work for you.

00:15:38.140 --> 00:15:39.600
You don't work for the math.

00:15:39.600 --> 00:15:43.740
All right and just to make the
point about the h k l plane,

00:15:43.740 --> 00:15:48.610
is perpendicular to the
h k l direction.

00:15:48.610 --> 00:15:49.730
So that's good.

00:15:49.730 --> 00:15:51.960
And the last thing I want to
show you that comes out of the

00:15:51.960 --> 00:15:58.200
use of the Miller indices for
planes, is that another

00:15:58.200 --> 00:16:00.530
property that we'd
like to know is

00:16:00.530 --> 00:16:02.150
the interplanar spacing.

00:16:02.150 --> 00:16:05.360
What's the spacing between
like planes.

00:16:05.360 --> 00:16:15.810
So interplanar spacing, that is
to say the distance between

00:16:15.810 --> 00:16:27.426
like planes, adjacent planes
identical index.

00:16:33.470 --> 00:16:40.620
I'm going to write it to be
specific to say Miller index,

00:16:40.620 --> 00:16:43.710
h k l in parentheses.

00:16:43.710 --> 00:16:45.760
And the property that comes out
of this-- and you don't

00:16:45.760 --> 00:16:46.500
have to derive it.

00:16:46.500 --> 00:16:49.530
Somebody worked this out for
you about a 150 years ago--

00:16:49.530 --> 00:16:53.420
is that the distance between
adjacent planes with the index

00:16:53.420 --> 00:16:58.040
h k l is given by the ratio
of a, which is the lattice

00:16:58.040 --> 00:17:05.670
constant, this is the cubed
edge, divided by the sum of

00:17:05.670 --> 00:17:13.710
the squares of h, k, and l taken
to the power of 1/2, So

00:17:13.710 --> 00:17:16.520
the square root of h squared
plus k squared plus l squared

00:17:16.520 --> 00:17:22.430
divided into the lattice
constant, gives you the value

00:17:22.430 --> 00:17:25.010
of the spacing in between.

00:17:25.010 --> 00:17:28.280
And this is the a just
to be clear about it.

00:17:28.280 --> 00:17:32.686
So for example, I think I've
got some cartoons up

00:17:32.686 --> 00:17:33.900
here that show this.

00:17:33.900 --> 00:17:35.080
So here's 0 1 0.

00:17:35.080 --> 00:17:35.720
It's trivial.

00:17:35.720 --> 00:17:37.860
What's the distance here?

00:17:37.860 --> 00:17:40.780
The d 0 1 0 is just day.

00:17:40.780 --> 00:17:41.370
How about here?

00:17:41.370 --> 00:17:44.490
This is 0 squared, 2 squared.

00:17:44.490 --> 00:17:46.290
0 squared, this is d over 2.

00:17:46.290 --> 00:17:48.320
So this is a 0 2 0 plane.

00:17:48.320 --> 00:17:53.270
But if the distance between 0
2 0 planes is 1/2 a, well,

00:17:53.270 --> 00:17:54.970
then that's an 0 2 0 plane.

00:17:54.970 --> 00:17:56.980
Then this is an 0 2 0 plane.

00:17:56.980 --> 00:18:00.960
So point of fact, every 0 1
0 plane is an 0 2 0 plane.

00:18:00.960 --> 00:18:03.740
But every 0 2 0 plane isn't
an 0 1 0 plane.

00:18:03.740 --> 00:18:07.660
You can see that some planes
have multiple names.

00:18:07.660 --> 00:18:08.090
Here's another one.

00:18:08.090 --> 00:18:11.650
Look, this is the distance
between adjacent 1 1 1 planes.

00:18:11.650 --> 00:18:12.910
It's a over root 3.

00:18:12.910 --> 00:18:16.620
So as the index goes up, as h
k l goes up, the distance

00:18:16.620 --> 00:18:18.590
between successive
planes goes down.

00:18:18.590 --> 00:18:22.150
And the angle between
the planes goes up.

00:18:22.150 --> 00:18:24.240
The easiest one is orthogonal.

00:18:24.240 --> 00:18:26.520
OK, that's good.

00:18:26.520 --> 00:18:27.740
That's good.

00:18:27.740 --> 00:18:28.200
All right.

00:18:28.200 --> 00:18:31.700
I think that's a good
place to stop.

00:18:31.700 --> 00:18:33.920
I dread these kinds
of lessons.

00:18:33.920 --> 00:18:35.620
And I'm sorry that the
parents ended up here

00:18:35.620 --> 00:18:36.390
on a day like today.

00:18:36.390 --> 00:18:39.500
But there's a little bit of
this notation and taxonomy

00:18:39.500 --> 00:18:40.650
that they have to know.

00:18:40.650 --> 00:18:41.795
And so we suffer through it.

00:18:41.795 --> 00:18:43.600
And then we get on
to the meat.

00:18:43.600 --> 00:18:45.520
Now we're ready for some meat.

00:18:45.520 --> 00:18:49.050
Now that we can describe crystal
structure, we're ready

00:18:49.050 --> 00:18:51.270
for physical measurement
of crystal structure.

00:18:51.270 --> 00:18:55.180
So what I want to start today
is the characterization of

00:18:55.180 --> 00:18:56.555
crystal structure by x-rays.

00:19:01.540 --> 00:19:02.400
How do we measure?

00:19:02.400 --> 00:19:05.820
How do we know that
gold is fcc.

00:19:05.820 --> 00:19:07.070
We use x-rays.

00:19:18.700 --> 00:19:22.660
So today what I want to do is
start as I always do on new

00:19:22.660 --> 00:19:24.470
unit with history lesson.

00:19:24.470 --> 00:19:26.720
We'll start with the discovery
of x-rays.

00:19:26.720 --> 00:19:28.580
And we'll get into the
underlying physics.

00:19:28.580 --> 00:19:31.620
And the next day we'll look at
applications including x-ray

00:19:31.620 --> 00:19:32.340
diffraction.

00:19:32.340 --> 00:19:35.330
So first of all, what
are x-rays?

00:19:35.330 --> 00:19:38.642
They're a form of
electromagnetic radiation.

00:19:43.680 --> 00:19:45.040
And they have the property
of that.

00:19:45.040 --> 00:19:50.490
They have very short
wavelength.

00:19:50.490 --> 00:19:51.230
How short?

00:19:51.230 --> 00:19:56.820
It's on the order of about
angstroms. So strictly

00:19:56.820 --> 00:20:04.260
speaking, it goes from about
1/100 to 100 angstroms. So

00:20:04.260 --> 00:20:09.480
centered at about 1 angstrom is
the center of the x region

00:20:09.480 --> 00:20:10.960
of the spectrum.

00:20:10.960 --> 00:20:14.270
And because they're a form of
electromagnetic radiation,

00:20:14.270 --> 00:20:20.000
their energy is given by these
equations, hu equals hc over

00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:23.540
lambda or hc u bar.

00:20:23.540 --> 00:20:26.900
Those equations that you've seen
over and over again apply

00:20:26.900 --> 00:20:31.390
for the energy of an x-ray,
because an x-ray is identical

00:20:31.390 --> 00:20:35.120
to a photon of wavelength
somewhere down at this level.

00:20:35.120 --> 00:20:36.240
Why do we care about this?

00:20:36.240 --> 00:20:38.540
Because this is atomic
dimensions.

00:20:38.540 --> 00:20:41.020
If I want to measure the
dimension of the human hair, I

00:20:41.020 --> 00:20:42.110
don't use a yard stick.

00:20:42.110 --> 00:20:44.980
I use something that is of
the human hair dimension.

00:20:44.980 --> 00:20:47.580
If we want to get into the
characterization of atomic

00:20:47.580 --> 00:20:51.330
structure, we need a measurement
tool that is on

00:20:51.330 --> 00:20:53.120
the order of that blank scale.

00:20:53.120 --> 00:20:56.150
And that's why we're going
to use x-rays.

00:20:56.150 --> 00:21:00.410
Now other property, I said very,
very short wavelength.

00:21:00.410 --> 00:21:02.650
But because of this inverse
relationship between

00:21:02.650 --> 00:21:05.320
wavelength and energy, I want
to draw attention to these

00:21:05.320 --> 00:21:08.770
superbly high value of energy.

00:21:08.770 --> 00:21:14.930
So let's plug in the energy for
lambda equals 1 angstrom.

00:21:14.930 --> 00:21:22.540
When lambda equals 1 angstrom,
we end up with 12,400 electron

00:21:22.540 --> 00:21:23.920
volts per photon.

00:21:28.710 --> 00:21:31.400
Now what's that mean, just
to put it in perspective?

00:21:31.400 --> 00:21:33.640
Look up here at the
table I've shown.

00:21:33.640 --> 00:21:38.320
We know the ionization energy,
the lone electron in hydrogen

00:21:38.320 --> 00:21:41.570
is 13.6 electron volts,
which is 14 to

00:21:41.570 --> 00:21:43.440
2 significant figures.

00:21:43.440 --> 00:21:46.200
And then we go to helium.

00:21:46.200 --> 00:21:47.950
You pull these off the
periodic table.

00:21:47.950 --> 00:21:49.630
This is the first ionization
energy.

00:21:49.630 --> 00:21:52.210
And they're down around
somewhere

00:21:52.210 --> 00:21:54.100
about 10 electron volts.

00:21:54.100 --> 00:21:54.610
Look at.

00:21:54.610 --> 00:21:56.560
This is 12,400.

00:21:56.560 --> 00:21:58.740
So let's go down to the
1 electron atom.

00:21:58.740 --> 00:22:00.100
So this is helium plus.

00:22:00.100 --> 00:22:01.770
This is lithium 2 plus.

00:22:01.770 --> 00:22:07.220
And we see a set of numbers here
that follow this sequence

00:22:07.220 --> 00:22:11.480
1 4 9 16, which is nothing more
than the sequence you

00:22:11.480 --> 00:22:15.200
would expect for a series of 1
electron atoms. It's K, which

00:22:15.200 --> 00:22:20.590
is 13.6 times the square of z/
So z here is 2, z here is 3, z

00:22:20.590 --> 00:22:21.790
here is 4, and so on.

00:22:21.790 --> 00:22:25.360
But even so, this is the last
electron of nitrogen.

00:22:25.360 --> 00:22:29.110
The most tightly bound electron
of nitrogen, 668

00:22:29.110 --> 00:22:29.940
electron volts.

00:22:29.940 --> 00:22:31.290
That's a huge amount
of energy.

00:22:31.290 --> 00:22:35.540
But that pales in comparison
to 12,400 electron volts.

00:22:35.540 --> 00:22:41.820
So this is clearly ionizing
radiation writ large.

00:22:41.820 --> 00:22:43.810
What do I mean by ionizing
radiation?

00:22:43.810 --> 00:22:47.070
It has the capacity to
ionize everything.

00:22:47.070 --> 00:22:51.560
Every electron will
be blown away.

00:22:51.560 --> 00:22:54.140
This is called knocking
the stuffing out of

00:22:54.140 --> 00:22:56.500
the electron structure.

00:22:56.500 --> 00:22:59.790
So that's what we're
dealing with.

00:22:59.790 --> 00:23:03.030
So now let's go to the
origin of x-rays.

00:23:03.030 --> 00:23:06.410
So how did we discover x-rays?

00:23:06.410 --> 00:23:10.080
Well, it was a dark and stormy
night, not unlike the weather

00:23:10.080 --> 00:23:12.132
today, apropos of the lesson.

00:23:12.132 --> 00:23:18.450
It was November 8, 1895.

00:23:18.450 --> 00:23:22.600
And it was at the home and
laboratory of a professor.

00:23:22.600 --> 00:23:25.800
Of course it's a professor,
Professor Wilhelm Roentgen.

00:23:32.970 --> 00:23:38.780
And he was a professor of
physics at the University of

00:23:38.780 --> 00:23:50.470
Wurzburg in Bavaria, now
part of Germany.

00:23:50.470 --> 00:23:53.790
And he was doing research, as
many people were in the 1890s,

00:23:53.790 --> 00:23:57.880
on the properties of gas
discharge tubes.

00:23:57.880 --> 00:24:01.350
He was studying gas
discharge tubes.

00:24:01.350 --> 00:24:05.130
And he had a special interest
in gas discharge tubes.

00:24:05.130 --> 00:24:05.910
Remember Lorentz?

00:24:05.910 --> 00:24:07.820
He like to put the gas
discharge tubes

00:24:07.820 --> 00:24:08.870
in a magnetic field.

00:24:08.870 --> 00:24:11.400
Stark liked the put them
in an electric field.

00:24:11.400 --> 00:24:13.990
And what was Roentgen's
pet project?

00:24:13.990 --> 00:24:16.390
Roentgen loved high voltage.

00:24:16.390 --> 00:24:18.510
He loved high voltage
an low pressure.

00:24:18.510 --> 00:24:29.240
He was focused high voltage,
low pressure, near vacuum.

00:24:29.240 --> 00:24:35.410
And so let's have a drawing
of what he used.

00:24:35.410 --> 00:24:41.040
And here's an image of the
museum that is literally in

00:24:41.040 --> 00:24:43.170
the house that was
occupied by him.

00:24:43.170 --> 00:24:45.990
So the apparatus is sitting
right there on the table.

00:24:45.990 --> 00:24:47.710
And here's the heart
of the apparatus.

00:24:47.710 --> 00:24:50.040
I'm going to go to a fresh board
because I need a little

00:24:50.040 --> 00:24:51.480
extra room here.

00:24:51.480 --> 00:24:54.230
So we know what the gas
discharge tube looks like.

00:24:54.230 --> 00:24:57.590
It's a glass tube, sealed.

00:24:57.590 --> 00:25:02.990
And we've got feedthroughs for
electrodes at both ends.

00:25:02.990 --> 00:25:06.280
And this goes down to
a power supply.

00:25:06.280 --> 00:25:09.460
And the power supply
that he used was

00:25:09.460 --> 00:25:12.540
batteries of chromic acid.

00:25:12.540 --> 00:25:14.140
And they were open beakers.

00:25:14.140 --> 00:25:16.310
And they were down in the
basement two floors below.

00:25:16.310 --> 00:25:18.270
And he had wires going
from the basement up

00:25:18.270 --> 00:25:19.550
to the second floor.

00:25:19.550 --> 00:25:21.810
And he was able to generate
about 20 volts.

00:25:21.810 --> 00:25:23.300
So he had a number of
these in series.

00:25:23.300 --> 00:25:24.790
Because this is roughly
a 1-volt system.

00:25:24.790 --> 00:25:27.130
So round numbers, you got
about two dozen of these

00:25:27.130 --> 00:25:28.305
things in series.

00:25:28.305 --> 00:25:32.210
And I'm going to write
here, in the cellar.

00:25:32.210 --> 00:25:33.560
Now how did he get
the high voltage?

00:25:33.560 --> 00:25:37.070
He put in here something that we
wouldn't recognize today as

00:25:37.070 --> 00:25:37.680
an inductor.

00:25:37.680 --> 00:25:40.960
He called it a choke coil.

00:25:40.960 --> 00:25:44.630
And what the choke coil did, is
it would charge up until it

00:25:44.630 --> 00:25:47.840
got to 35,000 volts.

00:25:47.840 --> 00:25:51.620
When it got to 35,000 volts, it
would discharge and send a

00:25:51.620 --> 00:25:55.480
current at 35,000 volts
to the cathode here.

00:25:58.410 --> 00:26:04.540
And with 35,000 volts, the
cathode would send electrons

00:26:04.540 --> 00:26:08.230
boiling off the cathode, heading
towards the anode with

00:26:08.230 --> 00:26:12.490
the kinetic energy associated
with 35,000 volts.

00:26:12.490 --> 00:26:14.800
And this discharged at about
eight times a second.

00:26:14.800 --> 00:26:16.640
So I'm going to write
8 hertz here.

00:26:16.640 --> 00:26:19.960
So eight times a second this
thing, bam, bam, bam, bam.

00:26:19.960 --> 00:26:22.650
And the electrons go
firing off here.

00:26:22.650 --> 00:26:25.480
And this to make sure he had
really low pressure, he had

00:26:25.480 --> 00:26:26.960
the cell open actually.

00:26:26.960 --> 00:26:29.060
And this went to
a vacuum pump.

00:26:32.820 --> 00:26:36.610
He had almost no gas
molecules in here.

00:26:36.610 --> 00:26:39.700
Now, the way he did the
experiment is, he'd set this

00:26:39.700 --> 00:26:43.320
thing up, started it going,
and this was after dinner.

00:26:43.320 --> 00:26:46.690
So on a Friday night after
dinner, he was upstairs.

00:26:46.690 --> 00:26:48.925
And he wanted to measure
emissions here.

00:26:48.925 --> 00:26:52.490
And so what he had, you either
get graduate students to sit

00:26:52.490 --> 00:26:57.300
there and you exploit their
labor, or what you do is you

00:26:57.300 --> 00:27:00.340
put up a detector here
which was a screen.

00:27:00.340 --> 00:27:05.680
So this is either a sheet of
paper or a sheet of cloth.

00:27:05.680 --> 00:27:09.460
So we call this a screen.

00:27:09.460 --> 00:27:12.480
And so you're going
to look here.

00:27:12.480 --> 00:27:15.070
All right you're looking at
this, seeing what's coming out

00:27:15.070 --> 00:27:17.160
of this gas discharge tube.

00:27:17.160 --> 00:27:19.845
And it was a screen up
paper or fabric.

00:27:23.340 --> 00:27:26.220
And it had been painted with a
chemical that would glow if it

00:27:26.220 --> 00:27:31.420
were struck by a particle, or by
a photon of a given energy.

00:27:31.420 --> 00:27:35.800
And they used in this case,
coated with the chemical

00:27:35.800 --> 00:27:42.840
barium platinocyanide, so
cyanide four times.

00:27:42.840 --> 00:27:45.170
So you make an aqueous
paste of this stuff.

00:27:45.170 --> 00:27:46.910
And you gob it on
to the screen.

00:27:46.910 --> 00:27:50.790
And when the screen is hit
by something, it sparks.

00:27:50.790 --> 00:27:52.750
And the latin word for
spark is scintilla.

00:27:52.750 --> 00:27:54.470
Have you ever heard of someone
being described as a

00:27:54.470 --> 00:27:56.030
scintillating conversationalist?

00:27:56.030 --> 00:27:59.040
It means they are a sparkling
conversationalist. So this is

00:27:59.040 --> 00:28:03.060
called a scintillation screen,
a scintillation screen.

00:28:03.060 --> 00:28:04.440
And so presumably, every
time there's an

00:28:04.440 --> 00:28:06.750
event, the screen glows.

00:28:06.750 --> 00:28:11.670
And so Roentgen starts
the experiment.

00:28:11.670 --> 00:28:14.400
And it's raining outside.

00:28:14.400 --> 00:28:14.950
There's thunder.

00:28:14.950 --> 00:28:15.570
There's lightning.

00:28:15.570 --> 00:28:17.670
There's a street light as
you can see right there.

00:28:17.670 --> 00:28:18.870
There's windows.

00:28:18.870 --> 00:28:21.150
And the thing is glowing.

00:28:21.150 --> 00:28:24.330
And he really can't detect
what's going on here.

00:28:24.330 --> 00:28:30.090
So he decides to
cover the tube.

00:28:30.090 --> 00:28:36.140
So he puts a wooden box around
the gas discharge tube.

00:28:36.140 --> 00:28:40.050
So now the gas discharge tube
is enclosed in a box.

00:28:40.050 --> 00:28:43.170
And he continues
the experiment.

00:28:43.170 --> 00:28:48.844
And what he sees is glowing on
this scintillation screen.

00:28:48.844 --> 00:28:53.780
The scintillation screen is
glowing even though the gas

00:28:53.780 --> 00:28:55.090
discharge tube is in a box.

00:28:55.090 --> 00:28:56.930
There was another observation
he made.

00:28:56.930 --> 00:28:59.500
The student earlier in the
day, who had painted the

00:28:59.500 --> 00:29:02.250
screen with the barium
platinocyanide.

00:29:02.250 --> 00:29:05.060
I guess he was practicing
his calligraphy.

00:29:05.060 --> 00:29:08.150
And he left a paper towel on
the edge of the bench.

00:29:08.150 --> 00:29:10.855
And he painted the letter
A on the paper towel.

00:29:10.855 --> 00:29:14.310
And the paper towel was glowing
with the letter A.

00:29:14.310 --> 00:29:17.170
And this thing is enclosed
in a box.

00:29:17.170 --> 00:29:20.930
So he's saying what's
going on here.

00:29:20.930 --> 00:29:24.600
So he decides that there's some
kind of an interaction

00:29:24.600 --> 00:29:27.560
between the screen and something
going on in here.

00:29:27.560 --> 00:29:31.030
So the first thing he does is
he says, well maybe it's

00:29:31.030 --> 00:29:32.510
electromagnetic.

00:29:32.510 --> 00:29:34.160
Maybe it's charged particles.

00:29:34.160 --> 00:29:35.610
So he takes a magnet.

00:29:35.610 --> 00:29:37.300
And he moves a magnet around.

00:29:37.300 --> 00:29:39.040
And nothing changes.

00:29:39.040 --> 00:29:43.050
He kills the power to the
gas discharge tube.

00:29:43.050 --> 00:29:44.100
Everything stops.

00:29:44.100 --> 00:29:48.570
So it's definitely inspired by
35,000 volts of energy going

00:29:48.570 --> 00:29:49.930
into the tube.

00:29:49.930 --> 00:29:53.405
So then he says, OK I'll take
a piece of black paper.

00:29:53.405 --> 00:29:55.910
And he puts the black
paper in between.

00:29:55.910 --> 00:29:58.210
And the screen continues
to glow.

00:29:58.210 --> 00:30:00.110
So then he takes a book.

00:30:00.110 --> 00:30:01.580
And he puts the book in front.

00:30:01.580 --> 00:30:03.420
And he sees the shadow
of the book.

00:30:03.420 --> 00:30:04.950
And he's standing
here like this.

00:30:04.950 --> 00:30:06.750
He sees the shadow
of the book.

00:30:06.750 --> 00:30:08.920
And he can see the shadow of
the bones of his hand.

00:30:15.390 --> 00:30:20.150
So he says, you know I don't
think it's particles.

00:30:20.150 --> 00:30:21.770
I think it's radiation.

00:30:21.770 --> 00:30:23.230
I think it's radiation.

00:30:23.230 --> 00:30:25.920
And maybe it's something like
that radiation that Hertz has

00:30:25.920 --> 00:30:27.140
been talking about.

00:30:27.140 --> 00:30:28.690
It's some kind of radiation.

00:30:28.690 --> 00:30:30.650
But I don't know exactly
what it is.

00:30:30.650 --> 00:30:31.710
It's mysterious.

00:30:31.710 --> 00:30:33.830
And x is the letter
of mystery.

00:30:33.830 --> 00:30:35.080
I'm going to call
it x-radiation.

00:30:38.750 --> 00:30:42.070
So he's discovered this
mysterious form of radiation.

00:30:42.070 --> 00:30:43.220
Does he rush to publish?

00:30:43.220 --> 00:30:44.230
No.

00:30:44.230 --> 00:30:46.830
He's not going to risk his
scientific career by

00:30:46.830 --> 00:30:49.420
announcing that he's discovered
a form of radiation

00:30:49.420 --> 00:30:52.220
that can see inside
the human body.

00:30:52.220 --> 00:30:54.800
That would be professional
suicide.

00:30:54.800 --> 00:30:58.030
So he continues to repeat the
experiments through November

00:30:58.030 --> 00:31:00.350
and December of 1895.

00:31:00.350 --> 00:31:03.460
And in January of 1896,
he finally publishers.

00:31:03.460 --> 00:31:07.960
And it takes the
world by storm.

00:31:07.960 --> 00:31:10.220
By the way, how did he
record this stuff?

00:31:10.220 --> 00:31:11.990
He used photographic plates.

00:31:11.990 --> 00:31:15.330
And he stored the photographic
plates in his lab in a wooden

00:31:15.330 --> 00:31:16.560
file cabinet.

00:31:16.560 --> 00:31:19.510
And so many of the plates were
fogged even before he got them

00:31:19.510 --> 00:31:20.390
to the experiment.

00:31:20.390 --> 00:31:21.780
Because of the x-ray,
they were going

00:31:21.780 --> 00:31:23.040
everywhere in the lab.

00:31:23.040 --> 00:31:26.850
And he was working there
the whole time.

00:31:26.850 --> 00:31:29.700
So what happens?

00:31:29.700 --> 00:31:31.630
What's the world's reaction?

00:31:31.630 --> 00:31:36.730
January 16, 1896, New York Times
reports radiation that

00:31:36.730 --> 00:31:41.800
can see through matter and peer
inside the human body.

00:31:41.800 --> 00:31:43.300
Peer inside the human
body, you say.

00:31:43.300 --> 00:31:44.630
Well, why is that?

00:31:44.630 --> 00:31:46.290
What's the big deal?

00:31:46.290 --> 00:31:50.740
Well, in London, immediately
there was a market response.

00:31:50.740 --> 00:31:54.620
A manufacturer claimed to be a
purveyor of x-ray proof lady's

00:31:54.620 --> 00:31:56.400
undergarments.

00:31:56.400 --> 00:31:58.020
I mean if you can see inside
the human body,

00:31:58.020 --> 00:31:59.820
it's Victorian England.

00:31:59.820 --> 00:32:02.130
How modest can you be?

00:32:02.130 --> 00:32:04.220
This is a calamity.

00:32:04.220 --> 00:32:06.360
In France, of course, they don't
care about such things.

00:32:06.360 --> 00:32:08.920
So they had a different
response.

00:32:08.920 --> 00:32:11.000
Remember this is where Daguerre
invented halide

00:32:11.000 --> 00:32:11.610
photography.

00:32:11.610 --> 00:32:13.310
So there it's very deep.

00:32:13.310 --> 00:32:14.620
It's very existential.

00:32:14.620 --> 00:32:18.740
Somebody claimed that with
x-rays he could irradiate and

00:32:18.740 --> 00:32:21.240
get a picture of
the human soul.

00:32:21.240 --> 00:32:23.230
How French.

00:32:23.230 --> 00:32:25.340
But I'm sorry to say
it, the wackiest

00:32:25.340 --> 00:32:27.000
comes from guess where?

00:32:27.000 --> 00:32:28.300
The United States.

00:32:28.300 --> 00:32:32.110
No lesser an institution than
the New York City College of

00:32:32.110 --> 00:32:34.070
Physicians and Surgeons.

00:32:34.070 --> 00:32:38.660
They proposed to use x-rays to
project drawings from text

00:32:38.660 --> 00:32:43.680
books of anatomy onto the brains
of students thereby

00:32:43.680 --> 00:32:46.105
creating, and I quote, an
enduring impression.

00:32:48.820 --> 00:32:51.370
In Iowa, we plumb new depths.

00:32:51.370 --> 00:32:53.620
There was a group out there
claiming that they could turn

00:32:53.620 --> 00:32:56.030
copper pennies into gold.

00:32:56.030 --> 00:32:57.800
So this was the response.

00:32:57.800 --> 00:33:03.480
But the thing that makes it so
fantastic is we take it for

00:33:03.480 --> 00:33:08.120
granted that if I want to
exercise power and exert a

00:33:08.120 --> 00:33:11.910
force on that can, I don't
necessarily have to make

00:33:11.910 --> 00:33:13.900
physical contact with it.

00:33:13.900 --> 00:33:17.690
We accept this as given that
you an either have direct

00:33:17.690 --> 00:33:21.390
mechanical contact, or indirect
contact, magnetics,

00:33:21.390 --> 00:33:22.280
what have you.

00:33:22.280 --> 00:33:25.280
But in 1896, this
wasn't given.

00:33:25.280 --> 00:33:29.890
So the notion that I could exert
a force on something

00:33:29.890 --> 00:33:32.250
from a distance was
very fresh.

00:33:32.250 --> 00:33:33.600
It wasn't so easy.

00:33:33.600 --> 00:33:38.350
But there were benefits of
the x-radiation already

00:33:38.350 --> 00:33:41.030
in middle of 1896.

00:33:41.030 --> 00:33:43.860
There was a seamstress who
had a broken needle in an

00:33:43.860 --> 00:33:47.510
industrial accident in Scotland
buried into her hand.

00:33:47.510 --> 00:33:48.270
This is trivial.

00:33:48.270 --> 00:33:54.090
Look, all you need is low
pressure in a gas tube, and

00:33:54.090 --> 00:33:56.340
you can set this up
in high school.

00:33:56.340 --> 00:33:57.360
It's nothing.

00:33:57.360 --> 00:33:59.430
People had this set up
in dentist offices.

00:33:59.430 --> 00:34:00.770
It's nothing.

00:34:00.770 --> 00:34:03.710
So this surgeon was able to find
where the needle was, and

00:34:03.710 --> 00:34:06.880
then use precision to go in and
take the needle out of the

00:34:06.880 --> 00:34:09.350
injured person's hand.

00:34:09.350 --> 00:34:12.040
In eighteen 1899 they were
already using radiation in

00:34:12.040 --> 00:34:13.510
treatment of cancer.

00:34:13.510 --> 00:34:15.420
So what is the relevant
physics?

00:34:15.420 --> 00:34:17.110
what's the relevant
physics here?

00:34:17.110 --> 00:34:18.890
Let's look at the relevant
physics.

00:34:18.890 --> 00:34:25.280
Well, when we're talking about
35,000 volts, and we're

00:34:25.280 --> 00:34:28.720
talking about energies in the
vicinity of tens of thousands

00:34:28.720 --> 00:34:32.510
of electron volts, you know
that this can't come from

00:34:32.510 --> 00:34:37.140
emission from an excited
electron in a gas molecule.

00:34:37.140 --> 00:34:40.470
The gas binding energies are
way lower than that.

00:34:40.470 --> 00:34:43.000
This must come from the solid.

00:34:43.000 --> 00:34:45.180
The electron leaves the
cathode, and it

00:34:45.180 --> 00:34:46.750
crashes into the anode.

00:34:46.750 --> 00:34:48.190
Here's the smoking gun.

00:34:48.190 --> 00:34:51.370
There's something going on here
when the electron crashes

00:34:51.370 --> 00:34:54.190
into the anode and then gives
rise to the radiation.

00:34:54.190 --> 00:34:56.660
So let's look inside
the anode.

00:35:01.060 --> 00:35:04.680
So what's the energy
level diagram?

00:35:04.680 --> 00:35:07.070
Let's say the anode
is made of copper.

00:35:07.070 --> 00:35:09.630
So what's the energy level
diagram look like?

00:35:09.630 --> 00:35:12.940
So we know up here we're going
to have energy is 0.

00:35:12.940 --> 00:35:17.730
And the energy quantum
state is infinity.

00:35:17.730 --> 00:35:19.650
Down here is the ground state.

00:35:19.650 --> 00:35:22.310
And the energy is the
ground state energy.

00:35:22.310 --> 00:35:25.040
And we know this is
up in the tens of

00:35:25.040 --> 00:35:26.780
thousands of electron volts.

00:35:26.780 --> 00:35:31.520
And then up here there's
an E2 for state 2.

00:35:31.520 --> 00:35:35.242
And up here is an
E3, energy 3.

00:35:35.242 --> 00:35:38.970
Then maybe an E4 for energy
4, et cetera.

00:35:38.970 --> 00:35:40.760
And I'm going to write
not to scale.

00:35:40.760 --> 00:35:45.110
This is just to give
you a sense.

00:35:45.110 --> 00:35:49.610
And so the ballistic electron
with, in this case, 35,000

00:35:49.610 --> 00:35:53.110
volts of energy, comes crashing
in to the anode.

00:35:53.110 --> 00:35:54.640
And this is one of these
mixed metaphors.

00:35:54.640 --> 00:35:58.030
So this is a Cartesian drawing
of an electron.

00:35:58.030 --> 00:35:58.350
All right?

00:35:58.350 --> 00:36:00.460
This is the incident electron.

00:36:00.460 --> 00:36:04.560
And its energy is given by the
charge on the electron, which

00:36:04.560 --> 00:36:07.960
is E, and the plate voltage,
which is 35,000.

00:36:07.960 --> 00:36:10.470
So it's got 35,000 electron
volts, which

00:36:10.470 --> 00:36:12.410
turns into 1/2 mv squared.

00:36:12.410 --> 00:36:14.270
It goes crashing into
this thing.

00:36:14.270 --> 00:36:17.730
And it's got enough energy
it can kick out top level

00:36:17.730 --> 00:36:20.460
electrons, mid-level electrons,
and in the extreme,

00:36:20.460 --> 00:36:26.570
it an eject ground state
electrons in 1s.

00:36:26.570 --> 00:36:28.670
By the way, the spectroscopists,
they don't

00:36:28.670 --> 00:36:29.220
like numbers.

00:36:29.220 --> 00:36:30.820
Remember, this is K.

00:36:30.820 --> 00:36:32.150
This is L.

00:36:32.150 --> 00:36:33.500
This is M.

00:36:33.500 --> 00:36:34.220
This is N.

00:36:34.220 --> 00:36:37.650
So we can eject K
shell electrons.

00:36:37.650 --> 00:36:40.630
What happens if we create
a vacancy down here?

00:36:40.630 --> 00:36:40.870
all?

00:36:40.870 --> 00:36:42.970
Of these electrons above
are unstable.

00:36:42.970 --> 00:36:44.970
If its copper, there's
29 of them.

00:36:44.970 --> 00:36:47.160
Now there's 28 with a vacancy.

00:36:47.160 --> 00:36:48.960
And they fall down.

00:36:48.960 --> 00:36:51.760
And when they fall down from
N equals 2 to N equals 1,

00:36:51.760 --> 00:36:53.510
there's a photon emitted.

00:36:53.510 --> 00:36:57.810
And that photon emission is in
the x region of the spectrum.

00:36:57.810 --> 00:37:00.330
But we don't just get
one wavelength.

00:37:00.330 --> 00:37:02.400
We get a plurality
of wavelengths.

00:37:02.400 --> 00:37:06.260
n equals 2 to n equals
1, we get a photon.

00:37:06.260 --> 00:37:09.260
There's a possibility to go for
n equals 3 to n equals 1.

00:37:09.260 --> 00:37:11.840
We'll get a photon of even
higher energy or a lower

00:37:11.840 --> 00:37:12.810
wavelength.

00:37:12.810 --> 00:37:15.260
Well, heck, if you've got enough
energy to kick out an

00:37:15.260 --> 00:37:17.830
electron from n equals 1, you've
certainly got enough

00:37:17.830 --> 00:37:20.210
energy to kick out an electron
from n equals 2.

00:37:20.210 --> 00:37:24.010
So you can get a cascade from
3 to 2, which gives us a

00:37:24.010 --> 00:37:27.990
photon, or from 4 to 2, which
gives us a photon.

00:37:27.990 --> 00:37:30.775
Can you see that you're going to
get an entire set of lines?

00:37:33.830 --> 00:37:35.610
We're going to label them
because we don't

00:37:35.610 --> 00:37:36.880
have a single line.

00:37:36.880 --> 00:37:38.190
So what do we label them?

00:37:38.190 --> 00:37:42.540
We label them on the basis of
the destination shell and how

00:37:42.540 --> 00:37:43.440
far they traveled.

00:37:43.440 --> 00:37:47.010
So this line here is known
as a K alpha line.

00:37:47.010 --> 00:37:48.650
Why is it a K?

00:37:48.650 --> 00:37:52.320
Because that's the nf.

00:37:52.320 --> 00:37:55.440
That's the n number of
the final state.

00:37:55.440 --> 00:37:56.890
And why is it alpha?

00:37:56.890 --> 00:37:59.540
Because the delta n equals 1.

00:37:59.540 --> 00:38:02.530
It came from 1 shell away.

00:38:02.530 --> 00:38:03.640
What's this one?

00:38:03.640 --> 00:38:05.430
It's gotta be a K
line, because we

00:38:05.430 --> 00:38:06.810
ended at n equals 1.

00:38:06.810 --> 00:38:08.500
But the delta is 2.

00:38:08.500 --> 00:38:10.690
It went from n equals
3 to n equals 1.

00:38:10.690 --> 00:38:13.030
So this is called K beta.

00:38:13.030 --> 00:38:15.400
So there's a K beta line
and a K alpha line.

00:38:15.400 --> 00:38:20.330
This ends at n equals 2, which
the spectroscopists call L.

00:38:20.330 --> 00:38:22.560
So we call this L.

00:38:22.560 --> 00:38:24.190
Delta is 1 L alpha.

00:38:24.190 --> 00:38:26.520
This is L, but delta is 2.

00:38:26.520 --> 00:38:28.730
So this is L beta.

00:38:28.730 --> 00:38:32.830
And what I can do, is I can plot
all of this on a curve

00:38:32.830 --> 00:38:36.980
showing the spectrum of this
particular element.

00:38:36.980 --> 00:38:38.900
And what do I expect to see?

00:38:38.900 --> 00:38:45.850
I expect to see a spectrum that
plots intensity versus

00:38:45.850 --> 00:38:47.120
some energy coordinate.

00:38:47.120 --> 00:38:50.050
It could be wavelength in this
direction, which means that

00:38:50.050 --> 00:38:52.140
energy increases in
that direction.

00:38:52.140 --> 00:38:53.830
And which has the
highest energy?

00:38:53.830 --> 00:38:56.890
The highest energy up here
is K beta, n equals

00:38:56.890 --> 00:38:58.580
3 to n equals 1.

00:38:58.580 --> 00:39:00.520
So there's K beta.

00:39:00.520 --> 00:39:05.370
And then close to
it is K alpha.

00:39:05.370 --> 00:39:07.580
And why do I put the
K alpha line higher

00:39:07.580 --> 00:39:08.610
than the K beta line?

00:39:08.610 --> 00:39:11.390
I don't know what the relative
amounts should be.

00:39:11.390 --> 00:39:13.280
But I suspect that if there's
a vacancy, it's

00:39:13.280 --> 00:39:14.760
like musical chairs.

00:39:14.760 --> 00:39:18.480
If there's a vacancy in n equals
1, and an electron only

00:39:18.480 --> 00:39:22.790
has to go from n equals 2 versus
n equals 3, the chances

00:39:22.790 --> 00:39:27.150
are the journey from n equals 2
to N equals 1 is easier, and

00:39:27.150 --> 00:39:29.750
therefore more frequent than the
journey from n equals 3,

00:39:29.750 --> 00:39:33.600
even though n equals 3 to
1 is greater energy.

00:39:33.600 --> 00:39:35.170
But 2 to 1 is more likely.

00:39:35.170 --> 00:39:37.990
And intensity reflects
frequency.

00:39:37.990 --> 00:39:41.540
The wavelength reflects
the energy.

00:39:41.540 --> 00:39:45.500
And then over here is
L alpha L beta.

00:39:48.480 --> 00:39:50.560
Now there's one more
piece here.

00:39:53.340 --> 00:39:57.690
The precise value here is
determined by the identity of

00:39:57.690 --> 00:40:00.110
the element in the anode.

00:40:00.110 --> 00:40:01.430
If it's copper--

00:40:01.430 --> 00:40:03.080
and I had to do this
as a junior at the

00:40:03.080 --> 00:40:04.030
University of Toronto.

00:40:04.030 --> 00:40:07.790
I spent a whole year doing
x-ray crystallography.

00:40:07.790 --> 00:40:13.700
And I will know on my death bed
the wavelength of copper K

00:40:13.700 --> 00:40:19.730
alpha radiation is to five
significant figures, 1.5418

00:40:19.730 --> 00:40:21.330
angstroms.

00:40:21.330 --> 00:40:24.790
Now if someone had fallen asleep
in this lecture and

00:40:24.790 --> 00:40:29.170
open their eyes right now, and
looked at the wavelength of

00:40:29.170 --> 00:40:35.450
this line as 1.5418 angstroms.
And I erase the letters Cu.

00:40:35.450 --> 00:40:38.970
You take one look at that,
and you say copper.

00:40:38.970 --> 00:40:43.710
Because only copper has a K
alpha wavelength of 1.5418,

00:40:43.710 --> 00:40:47.070
which means I can use x-ray
analysis to determine the

00:40:47.070 --> 00:40:50.220
identity of a unknown
specimen.

00:40:50.220 --> 00:40:51.960
And furthermore it's additive.

00:40:51.960 --> 00:40:56.490
So if I had a brass, which is
copper and zinc, the zinc K

00:40:56.490 --> 00:40:58.500
alpha line is over here.

00:40:58.500 --> 00:41:00.790
And I will have both lines.

00:41:00.790 --> 00:41:05.590
And the relative intensities
of the lines are related to

00:41:05.590 --> 00:41:09.490
the relative concentrations of
the copper in zinc. So now I

00:41:09.490 --> 00:41:13.280
have a tool for chemical
analysis.

00:41:13.280 --> 00:41:17.440
All of this from going upstairs
after dinner and

00:41:17.440 --> 00:41:20.000
horsing around with the
gas discharge tube.

00:41:20.000 --> 00:41:22.520
OK, so we're going to end
the formal lesson here.

00:41:22.520 --> 00:41:23.710
But we have a few
more minutes.

00:41:23.710 --> 00:41:27.000
So everybody is instructed to
not make a lot of noise and

00:41:27.000 --> 00:41:28.510
just sit quietly.

00:41:28.510 --> 00:41:29.440
So let's take a look.

00:41:29.440 --> 00:41:32.370
This is an image.

00:41:32.370 --> 00:41:35.520
This is an image of Bertha.

00:41:35.520 --> 00:41:38.750
This is Roentgen's wife.

00:41:38.750 --> 00:41:39.670
This is her hand.

00:41:39.670 --> 00:41:42.070
He invited her into the lab.

00:41:42.070 --> 00:41:48.760
And she stood for a full 15
minutes in front of this tube.

00:41:48.760 --> 00:41:53.140
And in that 15 minutes, got a
lifetime's worth of radiation.

00:41:53.140 --> 00:41:55.980
But what we're looking at here,
and what I'm going to

00:41:55.980 --> 00:41:59.440
point out to you in the last
several minutes here, Roentgen

00:41:59.440 --> 00:42:03.190
was a prissy physicist,
a really prissy guy.

00:42:03.190 --> 00:42:06.930
And he was German, which meant
that the German academics had

00:42:06.930 --> 00:42:09.320
no contact with industry
whatsoever.

00:42:09.320 --> 00:42:14.220
On the night of November 8,
1895, he invented three modern

00:42:14.220 --> 00:42:16.100
technologies.

00:42:16.100 --> 00:42:19.050
This is Bertha's hand.

00:42:19.050 --> 00:42:22.320
It represents the birth of
medical radiography.

00:42:22.320 --> 00:42:25.580
Is there anybody in this
auditorium who has never had

00:42:25.580 --> 00:42:30.180
an x-ray, a dental
or body x-ray?

00:42:30.180 --> 00:42:31.620
It's very rare.

00:42:31.620 --> 00:42:33.140
We see them all the time.

00:42:33.140 --> 00:42:34.730
We use them all the time.

00:42:34.730 --> 00:42:39.610
This morning I had one taken
about 9:10, right here.

00:42:39.610 --> 00:42:42.400
And I'm OK.

00:42:42.400 --> 00:42:45.220
So that's radiography,
medical radiography.

00:42:45.220 --> 00:42:49.210
Roentgen had a balance
in his laboratory.

00:42:49.210 --> 00:42:51.675
The justice, and she's got
the torsion balance.

00:42:51.675 --> 00:42:55.280
So you put the unknown on one
side, and then you put weights

00:42:55.280 --> 00:42:56.150
that are calibrated.

00:42:56.150 --> 00:42:57.480
These are made of brass.

00:42:57.480 --> 00:42:59.000
And they're in a wooden box.

00:42:59.000 --> 00:43:01.740
And so Roentgen has already
covered the tube

00:43:01.740 --> 00:43:02.840
with a wooden box.

00:43:02.840 --> 00:43:05.920
And so he took the emission from
this, and he radiating

00:43:05.920 --> 00:43:07.440
his box of weights.

00:43:07.440 --> 00:43:08.520
And what he see?

00:43:08.520 --> 00:43:11.510
He saw dark regions where
the weights were.

00:43:11.510 --> 00:43:14.780
Because metals have a different
electron density,

00:43:14.780 --> 00:43:17.430
because they've got a greater
atom density than wood.

00:43:17.430 --> 00:43:19.060
Wood is a more open structure.

00:43:19.060 --> 00:43:22.280
And so by contrast, he could
see inside the box.

00:43:22.280 --> 00:43:24.305
This is the basis for
airport security.

00:43:27.770 --> 00:43:30.640
Roentgen had a gun.

00:43:30.640 --> 00:43:32.650
He was not holding up
convenience stores.

00:43:32.650 --> 00:43:33.730
He was a hunter.

00:43:33.730 --> 00:43:35.760
He went into the woods.

00:43:35.760 --> 00:43:37.460
And he x-rayed the gun.

00:43:37.460 --> 00:43:38.990
Now why did he x-ray the gun?

00:43:38.990 --> 00:43:41.880
Now the gun is made of steel.

00:43:41.880 --> 00:43:45.100
But deep inside the steel,
there could be a flaw.

00:43:45.100 --> 00:43:46.220
There could be a crack.

00:43:46.220 --> 00:43:47.830
There could be a blowhole.

00:43:47.830 --> 00:43:49.840
The surface of the steel
looks beautiful.

00:43:49.840 --> 00:43:51.960
But inside is a crack.

00:43:51.960 --> 00:43:55.370
And that crack could lead to
failure under pressure.

00:43:55.370 --> 00:43:56.655
So Roentgen irradiates.

00:43:56.655 --> 00:43:59.440
And we already know from this
that different electron

00:43:59.440 --> 00:44:02.340
densities give different
shading, which means if there

00:44:02.340 --> 00:44:04.730
were a crack right here,
you might see it in the

00:44:04.730 --> 00:44:05.700
radiograph.

00:44:05.700 --> 00:44:09.450
And this we use for
certification of pressure

00:44:09.450 --> 00:44:10.770
vessels today.

00:44:10.770 --> 00:44:13.650
Certain pressure vessels that
have to be welded, have a

00:44:13.650 --> 00:44:17.810
specification that requires that
every inch of the weld be

00:44:17.810 --> 00:44:21.860
inspected by radiation, to be
certain that there are no

00:44:21.860 --> 00:44:24.530
cracks deep inside the weld that
under high pressure could

00:44:24.530 --> 00:44:29.510
open up, have an explosion, and
cause injury, or in the

00:44:29.510 --> 00:44:32.070
worst case, death.

00:44:32.070 --> 00:44:34.700
So what's the outcome
of it all?

00:44:34.700 --> 00:44:37.820
In 1901 when the Nobel Prizes
were offered for the first

00:44:37.820 --> 00:44:40.970
time, Roentgen by unanimous
vote of the selection

00:44:40.970 --> 00:44:44.550
committee was the first
recipient of the Nobel Prize

00:44:44.550 --> 00:44:45.510
in Physics.

00:44:45.510 --> 00:44:49.460
So on that occasion, he was
invited to come from Wurzburg

00:44:49.460 --> 00:44:51.660
and to deliver a lecture
in Stockholm.

00:44:51.660 --> 00:44:55.060
I've been to the place, it's
a spectacular hall, gilded,

00:44:55.060 --> 00:44:57.980
beautiful champagne reception,
elegant dinner.

00:44:57.980 --> 00:45:00.090
And he gives a lecture.

00:45:00.090 --> 00:45:01.310
And what's his lecture on?

00:45:01.310 --> 00:45:03.100
The discovery of x-rays.

00:45:03.100 --> 00:45:05.460
He received a huge amount
of money at the

00:45:05.460 --> 00:45:07.460
time in prize money.

00:45:07.460 --> 00:45:10.610
And he returned to Wurzburg
What did he do

00:45:10.610 --> 00:45:11.940
with the prize money?

00:45:11.940 --> 00:45:12.130
he?

00:45:12.130 --> 00:45:16.020
Donated it to the University
to be used for scholarships

00:45:16.020 --> 00:45:18.490
for students studying physics.

00:45:18.490 --> 00:45:21.100
And to this day, students
who study physics at the

00:45:21.100 --> 00:45:24.120
University of Wurzburg are
beneficiaries of the

00:45:24.120 --> 00:45:28.260
generosity of the first winner
of the Nobel Prize in Physics.

00:45:28.260 --> 00:45:30.400
Such was his humanity.

00:45:30.400 --> 00:45:32.110
I hope you have a
great weekend.

00:45:32.110 --> 00:45:34.760
We'll see the students
back here on Monday.
