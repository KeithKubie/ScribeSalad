00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:10.780
In the months leading up to the release of
Star Wars: The Force Awakens, fans spent a

00:00:10.780 --> 00:00:13.910
lot of time theorizing about what might happen
in the new film.

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:17.060
When they finally got to see the movie, they
discovered that there was still plenty left

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:20.590
to be discussed, as not all the questions
initially posed were answered.

00:00:20.590 --> 00:00:24.010
Moviegoers are now beginning the wait for
Episode 8, and they’re going back to what

00:00:24.010 --> 00:00:26.430
they do best: speculating about Star Wars.

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:31.840
Here are 10 amazing Star Wars: The Force Awakens
Theories That Change Everything.

00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:35.250
Han Solo Is Still Alive

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:39.020
For longtime fans, it was very heartbreaking
to see iconic character Han Solo meet his

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:41.410
noble end, being murdered by his own son.

00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:45.330
Understandably, they don’t want to think
about future Star Wars without Han, so some

00:00:45.330 --> 00:00:47.850
have hoped that Solo lived through the fateful
encounter.

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:51.870
After all, Darth Maul was cut in half and
was later revived in the animated Clone Wars

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:54.460
series, so why can’t something similar happen
for Han?

00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:56.620
Unfortunately, it’s just wishful thinking.

00:00:56.620 --> 00:01:01.039
Not only did the planet blow up, Han’s death
was the key emotional moment of Episode 7,

00:01:01.039 --> 00:01:03.050
and Lucasfilm won’t want to undermine that.

00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:07.110
There’s a reason Harrison Ford isn’t in
the Episode 8 cast.

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:08.420
Snoke Is A New Character

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:12.600
People have been trying to figure out the
true identity of Supreme Leader Snoke – but

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:14.270
what if it’s just Snoke?

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:18.710
One theory suggests that Snoke is an entirely
new character, not Darth Plagueis or another

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:20.030
reincarnated Sith.

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:24.670
The Sith thrive on emotion and attachments,
using the Force to serve their personal needs.

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:28.479
This goes against Snoke’s teachings to Kylo
Ren, where he tells his apprentice to purge

00:01:28.479 --> 00:01:29.750
sentiment and emotion.

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:33.799
Snoke feels the Empire fell because Darth
Vader loved his son, and if the Dark Side

00:01:33.799 --> 00:01:36.720
is to prevail, something like that cannot
happen again.

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:41.240
This would make Snoke something completely
new to the films, a welcome development.

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:42.920
Kylo Ren Saved Rey

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:46.970
Ben Solo destroyed the Skywalker family when
he turned to the Dark Side, but he still has

00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:48.610
a soft spot in his heart.

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:52.140
Some think that Kylo Ren is the one who took
Rey to Jakku where she would be safe.

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:56.380
In Rey’s Force Vision, there’s a part
where Kylo stabs someone about to attack Rey,

00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:58.140
suggesting he may have saved her during an
assault.

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:02.610
Kylo is also very interested in Rey throughout
the film, asking “What girl” when told

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:11.670
of her involvement with BB-8 and asking to
be her teacher in the ways of the Force.

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:21.540
The novelization implies he knows her, and
this would be an interesting dynamic.

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:22.669
Rey Solo

00:02:22.669 --> 00:02:26.820
The biggest mystery fans want solved is who
Rey’s parents are, and some think that there’s

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:28.720
still a chance she’s Han and Leia’s daughter.

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:32.859
Once Kylo Ren turned to the Dark Side, Han
and Leia went their separate ways, and only

00:02:32.859 --> 00:02:35.450
after did Leia discover she was pregnant again.

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:38.799
She kept Rey a secret from everyone and hid
her on Jakku for safety.

00:02:38.799 --> 00:02:43.080
The age gap between Kylo and Rey makes this
a possibility, and it would explain why Han

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:45.040
doesn’t recognize Rey when he first meets
her.

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:49.510
Still, in their interactions, Han and Leia
only discuss Ben – so this one is probably

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:52.570
just a stretch.

00:02:52.570 --> 00:02:54.290
Vader’s Helmet

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:58.370
Kylo Ren is very fond of his grandfather,
and even keeps Darth Vader’s helmet in a

00:02:58.370 --> 00:03:00.510
personal chamber to commune with in times
of need.

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:04.350
The connection between the two villains is
very interesting, and some think the helmet

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:06.299
was what swayed Ben Solo to the Dark Side.

00:03:06.299 --> 00:03:10.391
In Star Wars canon, the Force can embed itself
into objects, so it’s possible that the

00:03:10.391 --> 00:03:14.549
helmet of a Sith Lord is covered in darkness
and can leave a strong impression on a troubled

00:03:14.549 --> 00:03:19.440
young apprentice.

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:23.630
It would explain the strong bond between Ren
and Vader and why Kylo asks the helmet to

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:26.900
show him the power of the Dark Side again.

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:28.070
Luke and Leia’s Sibling

00:03:28.070 --> 00:03:29.709
Could there be another Skywalker?

00:03:29.709 --> 00:03:33.660
That’s what the opening text crawl in Episode
7 wants you to believe.

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:37.769
One line says that Leia is desperate to find
her brother Luke, without commas around the

00:03:37.769 --> 00:03:38.769
name Luke.

00:03:38.769 --> 00:03:42.450
According to grammar rules, there should be,
since “Luke” is not essential to the meaning

00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:46.449
of the sentence, just “brother,” unless
there’s a third Skywalker sibling viewers

00:03:46.449 --> 00:03:50.170
don’t know about.

00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:54.950
It’s most likely this is just a typo that
slipped by editing, but there’s no denying

00:03:54.950 --> 00:04:01.449
it would be one hell of a twist if it proved
to be true.

00:04:01.449 --> 00:04:03.910
Rey’s Force Training

00:04:03.910 --> 00:04:07.840
Some fans found it too convenient that Rey
as able to display such adeptness with the

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:16.400
Force as Episode 7 progressed since she had
no prior training – or did she?

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:20.940
Some theorize that Rey was a student of Luke
Skywalker’s before Ben Solo went bad, and

00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:24.780
whoever hid Rey wiped her memory so she forgot
her previous teachings.

00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:28.880
As Rey embarks on her adventure, the lessons
come back to her and she’s able to use powerful

00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:30.220
Force abilities.

00:04:30.220 --> 00:04:34.000
This would explain a perceived problem with
the film, but even if it’s untrue, it’s

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:35.180
no big deal.

00:04:35.180 --> 00:04:38.970
Luke was able to blow up a Death Star with
the Force, after all.

00:04:38.970 --> 00:04:40.200
Han Killed Himself

00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:44.330
Though it’s suggested Kylo Ren murdered
Han Solo, both had their hands on Kylo’s

00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:46.320
lightsaber before it was turned on.

00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:49.960
One theory says that Han was the one who put
the blade through his chest, realizing that

00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:56.390
the Dark Side had taken over his son and knowing
what was about to happen.

00:04:56.390 --> 00:05:00.590
In an effort to save Ben from one more sin
tying him to evil, Han decided to take his

00:05:00.590 --> 00:05:02.720
own life and spare his son the pain.

00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:06.730
This would make the scene even more emotional,
but the look of sheer surprise on Han’s

00:05:06.730 --> 00:05:09.750
face illustrates he was not expecting to die
in that moment.

00:05:09.750 --> 00:05:11.810
He just wanted his son back.

00:05:11.810 --> 00:05:13.160
Rey Skywalker

00:05:13.160 --> 00:05:16.840
The most common belief about Rey is that she
is the daughter of Luke Skywalker, and the

00:05:16.840 --> 00:05:18.260
film does enough to support it.

00:05:18.260 --> 00:05:22.470
The Skywalker family lightsaber specifically
calls out to her, and Rey is already strong

00:05:22.470 --> 00:05:24.690
with the Force – just like Anakin and Luke.

00:05:24.690 --> 00:05:28.820
The film’s script also implies that Luke
recognizes Rey when they meet at the end,

00:05:28.820 --> 00:05:31.510
suggesting Rey is not just an average inhabitant
in the galaxy.

00:05:31.510 --> 00:05:35.900
The numbered episodes are said to be a generational
tale of the Skywalker family, so Rey being

00:05:35.900 --> 00:05:37.550
Luke’s offspring adds up.

00:05:37.550 --> 00:05:41.161
Seeing a Jedi train his own daughter sounds
very compelling, so fingers crossed for this

00:05:41.161 --> 00:05:42.710
one.

00:05:42.710 --> 00:05:44.480
Kylo Ren: Double Agent

00:05:44.480 --> 00:05:48.950
What if Kylo Ren’s mission isn’t to consume
himself in the darkness, but rid the galaxy

00:05:48.950 --> 00:05:49.950
of it?

00:05:49.950 --> 00:05:54.160
Some think that Ben Solo is working as a double
agent to destroy the Dark Side from within,

00:05:54.160 --> 00:05:55.890
leading to his conflicted feelings.

00:05:55.890 --> 00:06:00.310
This would explain he was so emotionally torn
after killing Han Solo, having sacrificed

00:06:00.310 --> 00:06:04.139
his loving father for the greater good to
show his allegiance to the Dark Side.

00:06:04.139 --> 00:06:08.500
This would put an intriguing spin on things,
giving greater depth to an already intriguing

00:06:08.500 --> 00:06:09.500
character.

00:06:09.500 --> 00:06:12.620
The evidence supporting it now is slim, but
there are still more movies to come.

00:06:12.620 --> 00:06:25.240
As unlikely as it seems, this would be a great
twist.
