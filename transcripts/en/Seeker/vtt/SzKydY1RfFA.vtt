00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:05.360
The current Ebola outbreak in Western Africa
is the largest that humanity has ever experienced.

00:00:05.360 --> 00:00:15.330
Will we ever have a vaccine for this scary
disease?

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:20.670
Hey this is Carin for DNews. The ongoing Ebola
epidemic in several Western African countries

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:25.830
continues to dominate news headlines - for
good reason. In today’s global society the

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:31.800
potential for spread of a virus like this
is massive. Ebola is easily transmissible

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:34.260
between humans through bodily fluids - even
minute amounts of sweat or saliva can result

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:37.760
in viral transfer, which is why those that
are at the highest risk of contracting it

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:41.420
are health-care providers and family members
of those already sick.

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:47.960
There is currently no cure for Ebola, between
50 and 90% of those that catch the virus will

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:53.030
die from it. Those that manage to fight through
the infection generally do so through supportive

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:57.730
health care measures like blood pressure and
oxygen maintenance, and medications to control

00:00:57.730 --> 00:01:02.899
fever, allow the blood to clot and to prevent
other infections. There is currently no available

00:01:02.899 --> 00:01:08.020
vaccine for Ebola, although a study recently
published in Proceedings of the National Academy

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:13.250
of Sciences shows that scientists are making
significant progress in developing one for

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:15.090
wild Gorillas and Chimpanzees.

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:20.360
You may not know that Ebola is actually one
of the leading killers of wild apes. It has

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:25.600
actually killed over ⅓ of the worlds gorilla
population, leading to their status as critically

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:31.450
endangered. Because the Ebola virus spreads
so easily, conservationists generally support

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:36.799
vaccine development, even though they’re
potentially dangerous. They involve administering

00:01:36.799 --> 00:01:42.000
small doses of the offending bacteria or virus
to the body so that our immune systems can

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:47.240
mount an appropriate response. This way, we
become pre-emptively prepared in case we ever

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:49.350
come into contact with the pathogen again.

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:53.969
This is where it’s tricky to develop vaccines
for diseases like Ebola. There is NO amount

00:01:53.969 --> 00:01:58.799
that is safe to administer to apes or humans.
However, scientists have produced what seems

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:04.579
to be an effective Ebola vaccine by using
a ‘Virus-like particle’, a fragment of

00:02:04.579 --> 00:02:10.480
viral coat protein. Since a fully replicating
virus is not being transferred this is a much

00:02:10.480 --> 00:02:15.310
safer way to make use of the natural immune
reactions in the animals receiving them. Studies

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:20.190
in the past have demonstrated that this virus
particle vaccine is both safe and effective

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:26.130
in macaques, one of our primate cousins. But
the vaccine was recently administered to chimpanzees

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:28.670
and was found to be safe as well!

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:33.730
Just to be clear: chimpanzees were NOT challenged
with the Ebola virus. They were inoculated

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:37.850
with the particle vaccine in order to see
if it was safe for their bodies and to see

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:42.870
if they could mount a suitable immune response.
And they could. Antibodies harvested from

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:48.570
vaccinated chimps were transferred to mice,
who were then challenged by the ebola virus.

00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:49.770
The mice were protected.

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:55.440
Ok, so this is HUGE news for wild ape populations
world wide; and it’s potentially good news

00:02:55.440 --> 00:03:01.730
for humans too. The NIH has just announced
plans to fast track this vaccine and two others

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:06.980
to phase 1 clinical trials this September.
It seems like the use of viral particle vaccines

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:11.410
represents a very promising technique for
protecting us from deadly pathogens like Ebola.

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:16.060
What do you think? Should we be putting more
effort into developing an Ebola vaccine? Let
