looking forward to the conversation but

00:05:01.330 --> 00:05:01.340
looking forward to the conversation but
 

00:05:01.340 --> 00:05:04.300
looking forward to the conversation but
I wanted first a few remarks they

00:05:04.300 --> 00:05:04.310
I wanted first a few remarks they
 

00:05:04.310 --> 00:05:06.159
I wanted first a few remarks they
actually follow up on a lecture that I

00:05:06.159 --> 00:05:06.169
actually follow up on a lecture that I
 

00:05:06.169 --> 00:05:09.159
actually follow up on a lecture that I
gave here at SEPA in the fall that was

00:05:09.159 --> 00:05:09.169
gave here at SEPA in the fall that was
 

00:05:09.169 --> 00:05:12.220
gave here at SEPA in the fall that was
called the policy of the politics of

00:05:12.220 --> 00:05:12.230
called the policy of the politics of
 

00:05:12.230 --> 00:05:14.560
called the policy of the politics of
policymaking in non democratic settings

00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:14.570
policymaking in non democratic settings
 

00:05:14.570 --> 00:05:17.970
policymaking in non democratic settings
and it was for pop as it's known to its

00:05:17.970 --> 00:05:17.980
and it was for pop as it's known to its
 

00:05:17.980 --> 00:05:22.060
and it was for pop as it's known to its
friends at SEPA and in a sense it's an

00:05:22.060 --> 00:05:22.070
friends at SEPA and in a sense it's an
 

00:05:22.070 --> 00:05:23.920
friends at SEPA and in a sense it's an
interesting moment because of course I'm

00:05:23.920 --> 00:05:23.930
interesting moment because of course I'm
 

00:05:23.930 --> 00:05:27.640
interesting moment because of course I'm
moving from I hope an environment of a

00:05:27.640 --> 00:05:27.650
moving from I hope an environment of a
 

00:05:27.650 --> 00:05:29.640
moving from I hope an environment of a
non democratic setting to a

00:05:29.640 --> 00:05:29.650
non democratic setting to a
 

00:05:29.650 --> 00:05:32.560
non democratic setting to a
democratizing setting and the politics

00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:32.570
democratizing setting and the politics
 

00:05:32.570 --> 00:05:34.420
democratizing setting and the politics
of policymaking are getting all the more

00:05:34.420 --> 00:05:34.430
of policymaking are getting all the more
 

00:05:34.430 --> 00:05:37.870
of policymaking are getting all the more
complicated and confused but in

00:05:37.870 --> 00:05:37.880
complicated and confused but in
 

00:05:37.880 --> 00:05:39.520
complicated and confused but in
interesting and important sorts of ways

00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:39.530
interesting and important sorts of ways
 

00:05:39.530 --> 00:05:42.700
interesting and important sorts of ways
ways that I think do reflect both on how

00:05:42.700 --> 00:05:42.710
ways that I think do reflect both on how
 

00:05:42.710 --> 00:05:45.460
ways that I think do reflect both on how
we as political scientists think and how

00:05:45.460 --> 00:05:45.470
we as political scientists think and how
 

00:05:45.470 --> 00:05:48.580
we as political scientists think and how
we as prospective policymakers think so

00:05:48.580 --> 00:05:48.590
we as prospective policymakers think so
 

00:05:48.590 --> 00:05:50.830
we as prospective policymakers think so
you will forgive me if I indulge a

00:05:50.830 --> 00:05:50.840
you will forgive me if I indulge a
 

00:05:50.840 --> 00:05:53.409
you will forgive me if I indulge a
little bit in thinking about how these

00:05:53.409 --> 00:05:53.419
little bit in thinking about how these
 

00:05:53.419 --> 00:05:56.730
little bit in thinking about how these
revolutions or uprisings

00:05:56.730 --> 00:05:56.740
revolutions or uprisings
 

00:05:56.740 --> 00:05:59.709
revolutions or uprisings
reflect on the literature and the

00:05:59.709 --> 00:05:59.719
reflect on the literature and the
 

00:05:59.719 --> 00:06:02.140
reflect on the literature and the
practice of politics for a few minutes

00:06:02.140 --> 00:06:02.150
practice of politics for a few minutes
 

00:06:02.150 --> 00:06:04.029

and then obviously we can go back to the

00:06:04.029 --> 00:06:04.039
and then obviously we can go back to the
 

00:06:04.039 --> 00:06:06.399
and then obviously we can go back to the
stories if you want and I want to make

00:06:06.399 --> 00:06:06.409
stories if you want and I want to make
 

00:06:06.409 --> 00:06:08.770
stories if you want and I want to make
two basic points several one of which I

00:06:08.770 --> 00:06:08.780
two basic points several one of which I
 

00:06:08.780 --> 00:06:10.209
two basic points several one of which I
have made repeatedly here in this

00:06:10.209 --> 00:06:10.219
have made repeatedly here in this

00:06:12.459 --> 00:06:12.469
building so you'll have to listen to it
 

00:06:12.469 --> 00:06:15.689
building so you'll have to listen to it
one more time and another which is

00:06:15.689 --> 00:06:15.699
one more time and another which is
 

00:06:15.699 --> 00:06:19.749
one more time and another which is
subsidiary to that non democratic or

the word it is anything that is not

the word it is anything that is not
 

00:06:29.779 --> 00:06:31.839
the word it is anything that is not
democratic which can be a great variety

democratic which can be a great variety

democratic which can be a great variety
of things and it's hard therefore to

00:06:34.929 --> 00:06:34.939
of things and it's hard therefore to
 

00:06:34.939 --> 00:06:38.050
of things and it's hard therefore to
find patterns in policymaking if what

00:06:38.050 --> 00:06:38.060
find patterns in policymaking if what
 

00:06:38.060 --> 00:06:39.610
find patterns in policymaking if what
you're talking about is everything that

00:06:39.610 --> 00:06:39.620
you're talking about is everything that
 

00:06:39.620 --> 00:06:42.279
you're talking about is everything that
isn't something else and that may not

00:06:42.279 --> 00:06:42.289
isn't something else and that may not
 

00:06:42.289 --> 00:06:46.589
isn't something else and that may not
matter very much as one thinks about the

00:06:46.589 --> 00:06:46.599
matter very much as one thinks about the
 

00:06:46.599 --> 00:06:48.999
matter very much as one thinks about the
trajectory of the development of

00:06:48.999 --> 00:06:49.009
trajectory of the development of
 

00:06:49.009 --> 00:06:51.850

00:06:57.229 --> 00:06:59.080
future anyway in other words if this is
all going to be left in the dust and it

00:06:59.080 --> 00:06:59.090
all going to be left in the dust and it
 

00:06:59.090 --> 00:07:00.999
all going to be left in the dust and it
doesn't really matter what the politics

00:07:00.999 --> 00:07:01.009
doesn't really matter what the politics
 

00:07:01.009 --> 00:07:02.879

anyway then you sort of think well you

who cares but I actually think it is

not so it doesn't in that sense exist so
you have the kind of information that

you have the kind of information that
exists and isn't shared then you have

collaborating and changed sides and then

00:43:44.520 --> 00:43:44.530
collaborating and changed sides and then
 

00:43:44.530 --> 00:43:46.050
collaborating and changed sides and then
change sides again I mean look what's

so much of what Gaddafi created was a
 

00:44:02.130 --> 00:44:05.990
so much of what Gaddafi created was a
society of opportunism because how else

happens in Libya going forward will be

00:44:14.240 --> 00:44:14.250
happens in Libya going forward will be
 

00:44:14.250 --> 00:44:17.300

in his absence it will be very hard to
 

00:44:17.310 --> 00:44:18.500
in his absence it will be very hard to
convene those kinds of conversations

00:44:18.500 --> 00:44:18.510
convene those kinds of conversations
 

00:44:18.510 --> 00:44:21.670
convene those kinds of conversations

00:44:21.670 --> 00:44:21.680
without a lot of that score settling
 

00:44:21.680 --> 00:44:24.230
without a lot of that score settling

that doesn't bring all of that to the

00:44:31.220 --> 00:44:31.230
that doesn't bring all of that to the
 

00:44:31.230 --> 00:44:33.380
that doesn't bring all of that to the
surface and doesn't bring it all to the

00:44:33.380 --> 00:44:33.390
surface and doesn't bring it all to the
 

00:44:33.390 --> 00:44:36.010
surface and doesn't bring it all to the
surface in a violent way because Gaddafi

00:44:36.010 --> 00:44:36.020
surface in a violent way because Gaddafi
 

00:44:36.020 --> 00:44:38.390
surface in a violent way because Gaddafi
regime was very violent

00:44:38.390 --> 00:44:38.400
regime was very violent
 

00:44:38.400 --> 00:44:41.720

that's how mad I am
 

00:44:47.780 --> 00:44:50.720
that's how mad I am
maybe maybe which just has to you know

00:44:50.720 --> 00:44:50.730
maybe maybe which just has to you know
 

00:44:50.730 --> 00:44:53.480

burn itself out or maybe there's a way

00:44:53.480 --> 00:44:53.490
burn itself out or maybe there's a way
 

00:44:53.490 --> 00:44:55.160
burn itself out or maybe there's a way
to say no it doesn't have to burn itself

00:44:55.160 --> 00:44:55.170
to say no it doesn't have to burn itself
 

00:44:55.170 --> 00:44:57.710
to say no it doesn't have to burn itself
out let us see whether we can organize

00:44:57.710 --> 00:44:57.720
out let us see whether we can organize
 

00:44:57.720 --> 00:45:01.400

these conversations such that people can

00:45:01.400 --> 00:45:01.410
these conversations such that people can
 

00:45:01.410 --> 00:45:04.220
these conversations such that people can
express some of that but don't it

00:45:04.220 --> 00:45:04.230
express some of that but don't it

doesn't disintegrate into it and that's
 

00:45:05.850 --> 00:45:07.670
doesn't disintegrate into it and that's
the concern I have is that there are

00:45:07.670 --> 00:45:07.680
the concern I have is that there are
 

00:45:07.680 --> 00:45:11.420
the concern I have is that there are
deep deep deep anger and resentment in

00:45:11.420 --> 00:45:11.430
deep deep deep anger and resentment in
 

00:45:11.430 --> 00:45:14.180
deep deep deep anger and resentment in
that country much of it understandable

00:45:14.180 --> 00:45:14.190
that country much of it understandable
 

00:45:14.190 --> 00:45:16.310
that country much of it understandable
but also much of it going to be very

00:45:16.310 --> 00:45:16.320
but also much of it going to be very
 

00:45:16.320 --> 00:45:18.680
but also much of it going to be very
hard to manage in a Reconstruction

00:45:18.680 --> 00:45:18.690
hard to manage in a Reconstruction
 

00:45:18.690 --> 00:45:22.100
hard to manage in a Reconstruction

their domestic issues which and that was
 

00:52:40.720 --> 00:52:42.120
their domestic issues which and that was
one of the worries is that it would

one of the worries is that it would
 

00:52:42.130 --> 00:52:44.190
one of the worries is that it would

Libya so there's that kind of then I
 

00:53:00.579 --> 00:53:04.400
Libya so there's that kind of then I
think there is a perhaps more you know

do you want painted on the side of the

00:53:09.299 --> 00:53:09.309
do you want painted on the side of the

Egypt if Egypt works well this is eighty
 

00:53:34.269 --> 00:53:35.940
Egypt if Egypt works well this is eighty
million people and it would be

00:53:35.940 --> 00:53:35.950
million people and it would be
 

00:53:35.950 --> 00:53:38.579
million people and it would be
profoundly valuable to have a working

profoundly valuable to have a working
 

00:53:38.589 --> 00:53:41.670
profoundly valuable to have a working
transition in Egypt even if it came at

the cost of a little bit more difficulty

00:53:44.549 --> 00:53:44.559
the cost of a little bit more difficulty
 

00:53:44.559 --> 00:53:46.470
the cost of a little bit more difficulty
in Libya than would have been the case

00:53:46.470 --> 00:53:46.480
in Libya than would have been the case
 

00:53:46.480 --> 00:53:47.460
in Libya than would have been the case
of the and that would have been

00:53:47.460 --> 00:53:47.470
of the and that would have been
 

00:53:47.470 --> 00:53:49.440
of the and that would have been
complicated anyway for the Egyptians to

00:53:49.440 --> 00:53:49.450
complicated anyway for the Egyptians to
 

00:53:49.450 --> 00:53:51.210
complicated anyway for the Egyptians to
take a front line position in Libya

00:53:51.210 --> 00:53:51.220
take a front line position in Libya
 

00:53:51.220 --> 00:53:53.099

would have complicated Libya would have

complicated Egypt anyway so forth end to
 

00:53:56.650 --> 00:54:00.420
complicated Egypt anyway so forth end to
no real good end so so my view is that

00:54:00.420 --> 00:54:00.430
no real good end so so my view is that
 

00:54:00.430 --> 00:54:03.450
no real good end so so my view is that
it does make sense to have the Arab

00:54:03.450 --> 00:54:03.460
it does make sense to have the Arab
 

00:54:03.460 --> 00:54:05.700
it does make sense to have the Arab

during that phase like in Libya is very
 

00:54:18.579 --> 00:54:21.299
during that phase like in Libya is very
easy to like at least one can like see

00:54:21.299 --> 00:54:21.309
easy to like at least one can like see
 

00:54:21.309 --> 00:54:22.499
easy to like at least one can like see
what's happening there I see the

what's happening there I see the
 

00:54:22.509 --> 00:54:23.999
what's happening there I see the

00:54:23.999 --> 00:54:24.009
international interest in there and how

00:54:27.479 --> 00:54:27.489
what about Egypt so like the military is
 

00:54:27.489 --> 00:54:30.180
what about Egypt so like the military is

00:54:30.180 --> 00:54:30.190
it's obvious that it didn't have and
 

00:54:30.190 --> 00:54:32.640
it's obvious that it didn't have and
still doesn't have it's in its form when

it comes to a foreign policy wasn't in
line with Mubarak's regime so it was

00:54:37.380 --> 00:54:37.390

00:54:37.390 --> 00:54:39.150
line with Mubarak's regime so it was
apparent as soon as work step down that

00:54:46.380 --> 00:54:46.390
message so how do you think that is
 

00:54:46.390 --> 00:54:48.329

right that the debates within Egypt

00:55:13.150 --> 00:55:13.160
right that the debates within Egypt
 

00:55:13.160 --> 00:55:15.430
right that the debates within Egypt
today are not about foreign policy at

I almost surprisingly so it's not about

00:55:20.470 --> 00:55:20.480
I almost surprisingly so it's not about
 

00:55:20.480 --> 00:55:22.599
I almost surprisingly so it's not about
the United States it's not about Mubarak

00:55:22.599 --> 00:55:22.609
the United States it's not about Mubarak
 

00:55:22.609 --> 00:55:24.370
the United States it's not about Mubarak
relationship with the United States it's

00:55:24.370 --> 00:55:24.380
relationship with the United States it's
 

00:55:24.380 --> 00:55:26.260
relationship with the United States it's
not about Israel it's not about Iran

00:55:26.260 --> 00:55:26.270
not about Israel it's not about Iran
 

00:55:26.270 --> 00:55:30.609
not about Israel it's not about Iran
it's about domestic politics and over

00:55:30.609 --> 00:55:30.619
it's about domestic politics and over
 

00:55:30.619 --> 00:55:33.059
it's about domestic politics and over
the course of time I have to assume that

00:55:33.059 --> 00:55:33.069
the course of time I have to assume that
 

00:55:33.069 --> 00:55:35.680
the course of time I have to assume that
foreign policy issues will come to the

00:55:35.680 --> 00:55:35.690
foreign policy issues will come to the
 

00:55:35.690 --> 00:55:37.690
foreign policy issues will come to the
fore more than they have over the course

00:55:37.690 --> 00:55:37.700
fore more than they have over the course
 

00:55:37.700 --> 00:55:39.370
fore more than they have over the course
of the last six weeks or so but they

00:55:39.370 --> 00:55:39.380
of the last six weeks or so but they
 

00:55:39.380 --> 00:55:41.680
of the last six weeks or so but they
really have not been important issues in

00:55:41.680 --> 00:55:41.690
really have not been important issues in
 

00:55:41.690 --> 00:55:44.079
really have not been important issues in
the way people talk about the players

00:55:44.079 --> 00:55:44.089
the way people talk about the players
 

00:55:44.089 --> 00:55:47.410
the way people talk about the players
within Egypt so you're right I don't

00:55:47.410 --> 00:55:47.420
within Egypt so you're right I don't
 

00:55:47.420 --> 00:55:50.770
within Egypt so you're right I don't
think that that's something that the you

00:55:50.770 --> 00:55:50.780
think that that's something that the you
 

00:55:50.780 --> 00:55:52.990
think that that's something that the you
know when the when people talk about you

00:55:52.990 --> 00:55:53.000
know when the when people talk about you
 

00:55:53.000 --> 00:55:56.260
know when the when people talk about you
know it was clear that Clinton when she

00:55:56.260 --> 00:55:56.270
know it was clear that Clinton when she
 

00:55:56.270 --> 00:55:58.809
know it was clear that Clinton when she
came to Egypt got a very lukewarm

00:55:58.809 --> 00:55:58.819
came to Egypt got a very lukewarm
 

00:55:58.819 --> 00:56:01.150
came to Egypt got a very lukewarm
reception the youth of the revolution

00:56:01.150 --> 00:56:01.160
reception the youth of the revolution
 

00:56:01.160 --> 00:56:02.620
reception the youth of the revolution
wouldn't meet her and so forth and so on

00:56:02.620 --> 00:56:02.630
wouldn't meet her and so forth and so on
 

00:56:02.630 --> 00:56:03.760
wouldn't meet her and so forth and so on
so there's a little bit of arm's length

00:56:03.760 --> 00:56:03.770
so there's a little bit of arm's length
 

00:56:03.770 --> 00:56:07.780
so there's a little bit of arm's length
with the United States but beyond that

00:56:07.780 --> 00:56:07.790
with the United States but beyond that
 

00:56:07.790 --> 00:56:10.030
with the United States but beyond that
there's relatively little discussion of

00:56:10.030 --> 00:56:10.040
there's relatively little discussion of
 

00:56:10.040 --> 00:56:11.890
there's relatively little discussion of
it so it's hard to tell what that will

00:56:11.890 --> 00:56:11.900
it so it's hard to tell what that will
 

00:56:11.900 --> 00:56:13.059
it so it's hard to tell what that will
look like over the long term

00:56:13.059 --> 00:56:13.069
look like over the long term
 

00:56:13.069 --> 00:56:14.650
look like over the long term
you don't see that there's any other

00:56:14.650 --> 00:56:14.660
you don't see that there's any other
 

00:56:14.660 --> 00:56:17.049
you don't see that there's any other
forces inside Egypt playing internet in

against the interest the foreign
 

00:56:21.140 --> 00:56:22.569
against the interest the foreign
interests of the military so the

00:56:22.569 --> 00:56:22.579
interests of the military so the
 

00:56:22.579 --> 00:56:24.069
interests of the military so the
military has certain foreign interests

00:56:24.069 --> 00:56:24.079
military has certain foreign interests
 

00:56:24.079 --> 00:56:26.559
military has certain foreign interests
do don't you don't think that there's

00:56:26.559 --> 00:56:26.569
do don't you don't think that there's
 

00:56:26.569 --> 00:56:28.150
do don't you don't think that there's
any force inside the Egyptian society

funny kind of position keep in mind that
 

00:56:35.869 --> 00:56:38.799
funny kind of position keep in mind that
again in contrast to the Tunisian

00:56:38.799 --> 00:56:38.809
again in contrast to the Tunisian
 

00:56:38.809 --> 00:56:42.309
again in contrast to the Tunisian
military the Egyptian military actually

00:56:42.319 --> 00:56:44.589
military the Egyptian military actually
had combat experience and that has had

had combat experience and that has had
 

00:56:44.599 --> 00:56:46.329
had combat experience and that has had
two effects one of which is that it

00:56:46.329 --> 00:56:46.339
two effects one of which is that it
 

00:56:46.339 --> 00:56:48.099
two effects one of which is that it
continues to have a sort of residual

00:56:48.099 --> 00:56:48.109

hero's and patriotism and so forth aura
about it but it also means that it has a

there were shots fired although it was
 

01:01:32.810 --> 01:01:34.420
there were shots fired although it was
dark and so you can't tell they were

01:01:34.420 --> 01:01:34.430
dark and so you can't tell they were
 

01:01:34.430 --> 01:01:36.220
dark and so you can't tell they were
where they were firing but you have to

01:01:36.220 --> 01:01:36.230
where they were firing but you have to
 

01:01:36.230 --> 01:01:39.329
where they were firing but you have to
presume they were firing into the crowd

01:01:39.329 --> 01:01:39.339
presume they were firing into the crowd
 

01:01:39.339 --> 01:01:41.920
presume they were firing into the crowd
and apparently what happened was of

01:01:41.930 --> 01:01:43.089
and apparently what happened was of
course they got there and then the

01:01:43.089 --> 01:01:43.099
course they got there and then the
 

01:01:43.099 --> 01:01:46.359

protesters broke in to try and get them
 

01:01:46.369 --> 01:01:48.400
protesters broke in to try and get them

any reason to expect conflict at this
 

01:21:04.790 --> 01:21:07.570
any reason to expect conflict at this
point in time I think in the short run

point in time I think in the short run
 

01:21:07.580 --> 01:21:09.160
point in time I think in the short run
you're not going to see a substantial

01:21:09.160 --> 01:21:09.170
