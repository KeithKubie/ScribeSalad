00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.580
Augustine was a Christian philosopher, who lived in the 4th and 5th century A.D.,

00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:15.880
on the fringes of the rapidly declining Roman Empire in the North African town of Hippo.

00:00:16.040 --> 00:00:23.600
He served as bishop for 35 years, proving popular and inspirational to his largely uneducated and poor congregation.

00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:28.320
In his last days, a Germanic tribe known as the Vandals burnt Hippo to the ground,

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:31.360
destroyed the legions, made off with the town’s young women,

00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:35.200
but left Augustine’s Cathedral and library entirely untouched

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:38.580
out of respect for the elderly philosopher’s achievements.

00:00:38.580 --> 00:00:43.420
He matters to us non-Christians today because of what he criticised about Rome,

00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:45.580
its values and its outlook,

00:00:45.580 --> 00:00:49.560
and because Rome has so many things in common with the modern West,

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:51.960
especially the United States.

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:55.120
The Romans believed in two things in particular.

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:57.560
One, EARTHLY HAPPINESS.

00:00:57.560 --> 00:01:00.100
They were on the whole an optimistic lot.

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:04.000
The builders of the Pont du Gard, and the Colosseum had faith in technology,

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:08.580
in the power of humans to master themselves and in their ability to control nature

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:11.340
and plot for their own happiness and satisfaction.

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:17.160
Writers like Cicero and Plutarch had a degree of pride, ambition and confidence in the future,

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:22.780
which with some revisions wouldn’t be out of place in modern-day Palo Alto or the pages of Wired.

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:27.520
The Romans were keen practitioners of what we would nowadays call SELF-HELP

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:30.520
training their audiences to greater success and effectiveness.

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:35.420
In their eyes, the human animal was something eminently open to being perfected.

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:38.700
Two, A JUST SOCIAL ORDER.

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:43.600
For long periods, the Romans trusted that their society was marked by justice

00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:44.900
- JUSTITIA -

00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:48.020
people of ambition and intelligence could make it to the top.

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:50.980
The army was trusted to be meritocratic.

00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:57.380
The capacity to make money was held to reflect both practical ability and also a degree of inner virtue.

00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:01.820
Therefore showing off one’s wealth was deemed honourable and a point of pride,

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:05.080
and fame, was considered a wholly respectable ideal.

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:08.920
Augustine disagreed furiously with both of these assumptions.

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:12.760
In his masterpiece, The City of God, he dissected each of these two points,

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:16.040
that human life could be perfected and the societies were just,

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:19.080
in ways that continue to prove relevant to us today.

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:23.420
It was Augustine who came up with the idea of ORIGINAL SIN.

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:27.880
He proposed that all humans, not merely this or that unfortunate example,

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:32.540
were crooked because all of us are unwitting heirs to the sins of Adam.

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:37.580
Our sinful nature gives rise to what Augustine called a LIBIDO DOMINANDI,

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:42.300
a desire to dominate, which is evident in a brutal, blinkered, merciless way

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:44.260
we treat others in the world around us.

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:49.660
We cannot properly love, for we are constantly undermined by our egoism and our pride.

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:53.800
Our powers of reasoning and understanding are fragile in the extreme.

00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:55.980
Lust haunts our days and nights.

00:02:55.980 --> 00:03:00.820
We failed to understand ourselves. We chase phantoms. We are beset by anxieties.

00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:05.440
Augustine concluded his assault by chiding all those philosophers in his words

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:12.500
“have wished, with amazing folly, to be happy here on earth and to achieve bliss by their own efforts.”

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:16.560
It might sound depressing, but it may turn out to be a curious relief

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:22.620
to be told that our lives are awry not by coincidence but by definition simply because we are human,

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:25.940
and because nothing human can ever be made entirely straight.

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:29.040
We are creatures fated to intuit virtue and love,

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:32.200
but never quite being able to secure them for ourselves.

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:37.260
Our relationships, careers and countries are necessarily not as we’d want them to be.

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:42.440
It isn’t anything specific we have done - the odds are simply stacked against us from the start.

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:46.540
Augustinian pessimism takes off some of the pressure we might feel

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:51.780
when we slowly come to terms with the imperfect nature of pretty much everything we do and are.

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:56.780
We shouldn’t rage or feel we’ve been persecuted or singled out for undue punishment.

00:03:56.780 --> 00:04:00.900
It’s simply the human condition, the legacy of what we might as well,

00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:05.420
even we don’t believe in Augustine’s theology, call ORIGINAL SIN.

00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:11.660
Romans had, in their most ambitious moments, thought themselves to be running a meritocracy -

00:04:11.660 --> 00:04:17.520
a society where those who got to the top were deemed to have done so on the back of their own virtues.

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:20.740
After the Emperor Constantine’s conversion to Christianity,

00:04:20.820 --> 00:04:27.820
the philosopher Eusebious even proposed that earthly power was God’s instrument for establishing Christianity on earth,

00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:34.920
so that the powerful in Rome were now not just privileged, but also blessed and righteous in God’s eyes.

00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:39.000
What arrogant, boastful and cruel claims, responded Augustine,

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:44.020
there never was nor ever could be justice in Rome, or indeed anywhere else on earth.

00:04:44.020 --> 00:04:50.400
God didn’t give good people wealth and power, and nor did he necessarily condemn those who lacked them.

00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:54.440
Augustine distinguished between what he called TWO CITIES,

00:04:54.440 --> 00:04:57.580
the CITY OF MEN, and the CITY OF GOD.

00:04:57.580 --> 00:05:03.740
The latter was an ideal of the future, a heavenly paradise where the good would finally dominate,

00:05:03.740 --> 00:05:07.920
where power would be properly allied to justice, and where virtue would reign.

00:05:07.920 --> 00:05:10.560
But men could never build such a city alone,

00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:13.760
and should never believe themselves capable of doing so.

00:05:13.760 --> 00:05:16.820
They were condemned to dwell only in the city of men

00:05:16.900 --> 00:05:19.620
which was a pervasively flawed society,

00:05:19.620 --> 00:05:22.720
where money could never accurately track virtue.

00:05:22.940 --> 00:05:26.600
In Augustine’s formulation, true justice has no existence,

00:05:26.600 --> 00:05:31.300
save in that republic whose founder and ruler is Christ.

00:05:31.300 --> 00:05:36.100
Again it may sound bleak, but it makes Augustine’s philosophy extremely generous

00:05:36.100 --> 00:05:40.560
towards failure, poverty and defeat, our own and that of others.

00:05:40.560 --> 00:05:44.840
It’s not for humans to judge each other by outward markers of success.

00:05:44.840 --> 00:05:48.500
From this analysis flows a lack of moralism and snobbery.

00:05:48.500 --> 00:05:53.140
It’s our duty to be skeptical about power and generous towards failure.

00:05:53.140 --> 00:05:57.000
We don’t need to be Christians to be comforted by both these points.

00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:01.840
They are the religion’s universal gifts to political philosophy and human psychology.

00:06:01.840 --> 00:06:05.860
They stand as permanent reminders of some of the dangers and cruelties

00:06:05.860 --> 00:06:08.240
of believing that the life could be made perfect

00:06:08.600 --> 00:06:13.720
or the poverty and obscurity are reliable indicators of vice in a city of men.
