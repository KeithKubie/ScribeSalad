00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:21.119
theming with the explicit goal to have a
 

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:23.679
theming with the explicit goal to have a
larger engineering team behind it so

00:01:23.679 --> 00:01:23.689
larger engineering team behind it so
 

00:01:23.689 --> 00:01:26.420

we're working on implementing a lot of

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:26.430
we're working on implementing a lot of
 

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:29.060
we're working on implementing a lot of
the components based on the material

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:29.070
the components based on the material
 

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:34.460
the components based on the material
design spec and so material theming what

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:34.470
design spec and so material theming what
 

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:35.899
design spec and so material theming what
was the original problem with material

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:35.909
was the original problem with material
 

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:38.330
was the original problem with material
design well it was a great initial

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:38.340
design well it was a great initial
 

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:40.370
design well it was a great initial
version of a design system it worked

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:40.380
version of a design system it worked
 

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:41.990
version of a design system it worked
well in a lot of cases but it fell short

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:42.000
well in a lot of cases but it fell short
 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.980
well in a lot of cases but it fell short
what the expression of brand so here's

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:45.990
what the expression of brand so here's
 

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:49.100
what the expression of brand so here's
an example of an email app and it looks

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:49.110
an example of an email app and it looks
 

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:50.899
an example of an email app and it looks
kind of like every other app that used

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:50.909
kind of like every other app that used
 

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:52.910
kind of like every other app that used
material design and it's kind of hard to

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:52.920
material design and it's kind of hard to
 

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:55.399
material design and it's kind of hard to
tell that it's even an email app in my

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:55.409
tell that it's even an email app in my
 

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:59.719
tell that it's even an email app in my
opinion here's an example of the kinds

00:01:59.719 --> 00:01:59.729
opinion here's an example of the kinds
 

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:01.459
opinion here's an example of the kinds
of things that you can do with material

00:02:01.459 --> 00:02:01.469
of things that you can do with material
 

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:03.440

theming to make your app stand out and

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:03.450
theming to make your app stand out and
 

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:06.410
theming to make your app stand out and
we're gonna get into those details in a

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:06.420
we're gonna get into those details in a
 

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:11.020
we're gonna get into those details in a
bit so quickly how does theming work

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:11.030
bit so quickly how does theming work
 

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:13.750
bit so quickly how does theming work
basically material theming is a system

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:13.760
basically material theming is a system
 

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:15.580
basically material theming is a system
that we've designed to help you create a

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:15.590
that we've designed to help you create a
 

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:18.430
that we've designed to help you create a
unique design for your app you just need

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:18.440
unique design for your app you just need
 

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:20.620
unique design for your app you just need
to decide on a few things such as fonts

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:20.630
to decide on a few things such as fonts
 

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:24.160
to decide on a few things such as fonts
colors shapes etc and this is a material

with which should help you create design

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:29.450
with which should help you create design
 

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:31.230
with which should help you create design
ideas that you can use to build your app

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:31.240
ideas that you can use to build your app
 

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:34.390
ideas that you can use to build your app
take a look at material dot IO for more

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:34.400
take a look at material dot IO for more
 

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:37.780
take a look at material dot IO for more
info about that tool here's a few

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:37.790
info about that tool here's a few
 

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:39.580
info about that tool here's a few
material studies that we've done which

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:39.590
material studies that we've done which
 

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:41.740
material studies that we've done which
just show examples of material theming

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:41.750
just show examples of material theming
 

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:44.890
just show examples of material theming
and you can see that they all look quite

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:44.900
and you can see that they all look quite
 

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:48.580
and you can see that they all look quite
different and there's also a lot more of

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:48.590
different and there's also a lot more of
 

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:54.100
different and there's also a lot more of
these on material I oh cool

00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:54.110
these on material I oh cool
 

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:56.380
these on material I oh cool
so now let's get talking about how to

00:02:56.380 --> 00:02:56.390
so now let's get talking about how to
 

00:02:56.390 --> 00:02:58.420
so now let's get talking about how to
actually get started using the material

00:02:58.420 --> 00:02:58.430
actually get started using the material
 

00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:01.270
actually get started using the material
components library so imagine this

00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:01.280
components library so imagine this
 

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:02.800
components library so imagine this
scenario that will come back to a couple

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:02.810
scenario that will come back to a couple
 

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:04.990
scenario that will come back to a couple
times throughout this talk you got this

00:03:04.990 --> 00:03:05.000
times throughout this talk you got this
 

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:06.699
times throughout this talk you got this
fairly plain app that you built from

00:03:06.699 --> 00:03:06.709
fairly plain app that you built from
 

00:03:06.709 --> 00:03:08.650
fairly plain app that you built from
just straight app compat and your

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:08.660
just straight app compat and your
 

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:10.600
just straight app compat and your
teammate asks you to redesign this using

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:10.610
teammate asks you to redesign this using
 

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:12.640
teammate asks you to redesign this using
the material design spec so how do you

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:12.650
the material design spec so how do you
 

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:15.100
the material design spec so how do you
go about doing this so you may be

00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:15.110
go about doing this so you may be
 

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:17.920
go about doing this so you may be
familiar with the support library design

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:17.930
familiar with the support library design
 

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:19.690
familiar with the support library design

can't use the Kannada Android support

00:03:32.770 --> 00:03:32.780
can't use the Kannada Android support
 

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:35.380
can't use the Kannada Android support
and conduct google android packages

00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:35.390
and conduct google android packages
 

00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:37.150
and conduct google android packages
together so if you want to switch over

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:37.160
together so if you want to switch over
 

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:39.759
together so if you want to switch over
to Android X there's a nice refactor

00:03:39.759 --> 00:03:39.769
to Android X there's a nice refactor
 

00:03:39.769 --> 00:03:41.860
to Android X there's a nice refactor

by setting the icon attribute as well as
 

00:07:21.870 --> 00:07:24.170
by setting the icon attribute as well as
this icon style and this style is

00:07:24.170 --> 00:07:24.180
this icon style and this style is
 

00:07:24.180 --> 00:07:25.909
this icon style and this style is
optional but what it'll do is it'll

00:07:25.909 --> 00:07:25.919
optional but what it'll do is it'll
 

00:07:25.919 --> 00:07:27.770
optional but what it'll do is it'll
adjust the padding slightly to achieve a

00:07:27.770 --> 00:07:27.780
adjust the padding slightly to achieve a
 

00:07:27.780 --> 00:07:30.170

more even visual balance on the button

00:07:30.170 --> 00:07:30.180
more even visual balance on the button
 

00:07:30.180 --> 00:07:33.050
more even visual balance on the button
when the icon is present you can change

00:07:33.050 --> 00:07:33.060
when the icon is present you can change
 

00:07:33.060 --> 00:07:35.290
when the icon is present you can change
the icon size just using the attribute

00:07:35.290 --> 00:07:35.300
the icon size just using the attribute
 

00:07:35.300 --> 00:07:38.060
the icon size just using the attribute
you can set the outline button style

00:07:38.060 --> 00:07:38.070
you can set the outline button style
 

00:07:38.070 --> 00:07:39.230
you can set the outline button style

which is one of the default styles that
 

00:07:39.240 --> 00:07:40.610
which is one of the default styles that
we provide for this button to get this

00:07:40.610 --> 00:07:40.620
we provide for this button to get this
 

00:07:40.620 --> 00:07:44.480
we provide for this button to get this
hairline outline button you can set the

00:07:44.480 --> 00:07:44.490

00:07:46.650 --> 00:07:48.500
background tint of the button by setting
the background to an attribute and you

00:07:48.500 --> 00:07:48.510
the background to an attribute and you
 

00:07:48.510 --> 00:07:50.719
the background to an attribute and you
can provide a color state list here so

00:07:50.719 --> 00:07:50.729
can provide a color state list here so
 

00:07:50.729 --> 00:07:52.430
can provide a color state list here so
in this case it's purple when the button

00:07:52.430 --> 00:07:52.440
in this case it's purple when the button
 

00:07:52.440 --> 00:07:55.089
in this case it's purple when the button
is enabled and grey one is disabled you

00:07:55.089 --> 00:07:55.099
is enabled and grey one is disabled you
 

00:07:55.099 --> 00:07:57.800
is enabled and grey one is disabled you

on this button to get some styling you
 

00:08:04.229 --> 00:08:06.710
on this button to get some styling you
can also create just an icon only button

00:08:06.710 --> 00:08:06.720
can also create just an icon only button
 

00:08:06.720 --> 00:08:09.379
can also create just an icon only button
in this case we're setting the icon as

00:08:09.379 --> 00:08:09.389
in this case we're setting the icon as
 

00:08:09.389 --> 00:08:11.120
in this case we're setting the icon as
well as setting the icon padding to zero

00:08:11.120 --> 00:08:11.130
well as setting the icon padding to zero
 

00:08:11.130 --> 00:08:12.920
well as setting the icon padding to zero
so that the icon is centered in the

00:08:12.920 --> 00:08:12.930
so that the icon is centered in the
 

00:08:12.930 --> 00:08:15.290
so that the icon is centered in the
button and we are also setting the

00:08:15.290 --> 00:08:15.300
button and we are also setting the
 

00:08:15.300 --> 00:08:16.760
button and we are also setting the
content description on this button so

00:08:16.760 --> 00:08:16.770
content description on this button so
 

00:08:16.770 --> 00:08:18.500
content description on this button so
since there's no text for accessibility

00:08:18.500 --> 00:08:18.510
since there's no text for accessibility
 

00:08:18.510 --> 00:08:19.850
since there's no text for accessibility
reasons you should set a content

00:08:19.850 --> 00:08:19.860
reasons you should set a content
 

00:08:19.860 --> 00:08:21.140
reasons you should set a content
description so that people will know

00:08:21.140 --> 00:08:21.150
description so that people will know
 

00:08:21.150 --> 00:08:25.010
description so that people will know
what the bun is about you can also set

00:08:25.010 --> 00:08:25.020
what the bun is about you can also set
 

00:08:25.020 --> 00:08:26.960
what the bun is about you can also set
the ripple color on the button so for

00:08:26.960 --> 00:08:26.970
the ripple color on the button so for
 

00:08:26.970 --> 00:08:29.300
the ripple color on the button so for
example if you just set a purple ripple

00:08:29.300 --> 00:08:29.310
example if you just set a purple ripple
 

00:08:29.310 --> 00:08:30.920
example if you just set a purple ripple
on here it'll be applied to the button

00:08:30.920 --> 00:08:30.930
on here it'll be applied to the button
 

00:08:30.930 --> 00:08:32.600
on here it'll be applied to the button
you can set either a color state list or

00:08:32.600 --> 00:08:32.610
you can set either a color state list or
 

00:08:32.610 --> 00:08:36.320
you can set either a color state list or
just a hex value here and as you can see

00:08:36.320 --> 00:08:36.330
just a hex value here and as you can see
 

00:08:36.330 --> 00:08:37.820
just a hex value here and as you can see
it's like a purple ripple on the button

00:08:37.820 --> 00:08:37.830
it's like a purple ripple on the button
 

00:08:37.830 --> 00:08:39.140
it's like a purple ripple on the button
well that's because there's am alpha

00:08:39.140 --> 00:08:39.150
well that's because there's am alpha
 

00:08:39.150 --> 00:08:40.969
well that's because there's am alpha
already inherent in the ripple so it's a

00:08:40.969 --> 00:08:40.979
already inherent in the ripple so it's a
 

00:08:40.979 --> 00:08:44.890
already inherent in the ripple so it's a
purple ripple on top of a green button

00:08:44.890 --> 00:08:44.900
purple ripple on top of a green button
 

00:08:44.900 --> 00:08:47.000
purple ripple on top of a green button
and these are some of the examples of

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:47.010
and these are some of the examples of
 

00:08:47.010 --> 00:08:48.380
and these are some of the examples of
the other components that we provide in

00:08:48.380 --> 00:08:48.390
the other components that we provide in
 

00:08:48.390 --> 00:08:50.449
the other components that we provide in
this library we have several different

00:08:50.449 --> 00:08:50.459
this library we have several different
 

00:08:50.459 --> 00:08:51.660
this library we have several different
styles of chips

00:08:51.660 --> 00:08:51.670
styles of chips
 

00:08:51.670 --> 00:08:53.040
styles of chips
we have text fields with filled and

00:08:53.040 --> 00:08:53.050
we have text fields with filled and
 

00:08:53.050 --> 00:08:55.080
we have text fields with filled and
outline styles passwords show and hide

00:08:55.080 --> 00:08:55.090
outline styles passwords show and hide
 

00:08:55.090 --> 00:08:56.610
outline styles passwords show and hide
functionality and a character counter

00:08:56.610 --> 00:08:56.620
functionality and a character counter
 

00:08:56.620 --> 00:08:58.140
functionality and a character counter
and then we have some highly

00:08:58.140 --> 00:08:58.150
and then we have some highly
 

00:08:58.150 --> 00:09:02.820
and then we have some highly
customizable tab layouts as well okay

00:09:02.820 --> 00:09:02.830
customizable tab layouts as well okay
 

00:09:02.830 --> 00:09:07.410
customizable tab layouts as well okay
and now a little bit about deeming MDC

00:09:07.410 --> 00:09:07.420
and now a little bit about deeming MDC
 

00:09:07.420 --> 00:09:10.110
and now a little bit about deeming MDC
relies heavily on the built in theming

00:09:10.110 --> 00:09:10.120
relies heavily on the built in theming
 

00:09:10.120 --> 00:09:12.360
relies heavily on the built in theming
event of Android so here's just a quick

00:09:12.360 --> 00:09:12.370
event of Android so here's just a quick
 

00:09:12.370 --> 00:09:16.970
event of Android so here's just a quick
refresher of how themes and styles work

00:09:16.970 --> 00:09:16.980
 
 

00:09:16.980 --> 00:09:19.680
 
anything applied directly to a view and

00:09:19.680 --> 00:09:19.690
anything applied directly to a view and
 

00:09:19.690 --> 00:09:21.810
anything applied directly to a view and
XML is used first so changing an

00:09:21.810 --> 00:09:21.820
XML is used first so changing an
 

00:09:21.820 --> 00:09:24.240
XML is used first so changing an
attribute here will only change this

00:09:24.240 --> 00:09:24.250
attribute here will only change this
 

00:09:24.250 --> 00:09:30.600
attribute here will only change this
single view you can also update a the

00:09:30.600 --> 00:09:30.610
single view you can also update a the
 

00:09:30.610 --> 00:09:33.990
single view you can also update a the
style so if you set an attribute in a

00:09:33.990 --> 00:09:34.000
style so if you set an attribute in a
 

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:37.800
style so if you set an attribute in a
style changing this here will affect any

00:09:37.800 --> 00:09:37.810
style changing this here will affect any
 

00:09:37.810 --> 00:09:42.720
style changing this here will affect any
any views that are using this style if

00:09:42.720 --> 00:09:42.730
any views that are using this style if
 

00:09:42.730 --> 00:09:44.430
any views that are using this style if
it's not defined in a style or there's

00:09:44.430 --> 00:09:44.440
it's not defined in a style or there's
 

00:09:44.440 --> 00:09:48.180
it's not defined in a style or there's
no style set it'll it'll go back to the

00:09:48.180 --> 00:09:48.190
no style set it'll it'll go back to the
 

00:09:48.190 --> 00:09:50.700
no style set it'll it'll go back to the
default style so here if you want to

00:09:50.700 --> 00:09:50.710
default style so here if you want to
 

00:09:50.710 --> 00:09:53.940
default style so here if you want to
change the way a whole group of

00:09:53.940 --> 00:09:53.950
change the way a whole group of
 

00:09:53.950 --> 00:09:56.490
change the way a whole group of
components look you can set the default

00:09:56.490 --> 00:09:56.500
components look you can set the default
 

00:09:56.500 --> 00:09:59.820
components look you can set the default
style and then finally if that tribute

00:09:59.820 --> 00:09:59.830
style and then finally if that tribute
 

00:09:59.830 --> 00:10:00.990
style and then finally if that tribute
isn't defined anywhere else

00:10:00.990 --> 00:10:01.000
isn't defined anywhere else
 

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:03.480
isn't defined anywhere else
it'll look in the theme and the way

00:10:03.480 --> 00:10:03.490
it'll look in the theme and the way
 

00:10:03.490 --> 00:10:05.220
it'll look in the theme and the way
material theming works normally is

00:10:05.220 --> 00:10:05.230
material theming works normally is
 

00:10:05.230 --> 00:10:07.200
material theming works normally is
there's a set of top-level attributes

00:10:07.200 --> 00:10:07.210
there's a set of top-level attributes
 

00:10:07.210 --> 00:10:08.520
there's a set of top-level attributes
that you should override in your theme

00:10:08.520 --> 00:10:08.530
that you should override in your theme
 

00:10:08.530 --> 00:10:11.820
that you should override in your theme
for typography colors shapes etc and

00:10:11.820 --> 00:10:11.830
for typography colors shapes etc and
 

00:10:11.830 --> 00:10:13.920
for typography colors shapes etc and
also the default styles for all of the

00:10:13.920 --> 00:10:13.930
also the default styles for all of the
 

00:10:13.930 --> 00:10:15.630
also the default styles for all of the
components but if you need more

00:10:15.630 --> 00:10:15.640
components but if you need more
 

00:10:15.640 --> 00:10:17.940
components but if you need more
fine-grained control you can hook in and

00:10:17.940 --> 00:10:17.950
fine-grained control you can hook in and
 

00:10:17.950 --> 00:10:21.240
fine-grained control you can hook in and
any of these layers and change like just

00:10:21.240 --> 00:10:21.250
any of these layers and change like just
 

00:10:21.250 --> 00:10:23.460
any of these layers and change like just
the color of a single view or just the

00:10:23.460 --> 00:10:23.470
the color of a single view or just the
 

00:10:23.470 --> 00:10:26.210
the color of a single view or just the
color of like all of a certain component

00:10:26.210 --> 00:10:26.220
color of like all of a certain component
 

00:10:26.220 --> 00:10:29.040
color of like all of a certain component
so here's an example from our library of

00:10:29.040 --> 00:10:29.050
so here's an example from our library of
 

00:10:29.050 --> 00:10:32.820
so here's an example from our library of
the chip style it defines a few values

00:10:32.820 --> 00:10:32.830
the chip style it defines a few values
 

00:10:32.830 --> 00:10:35.550
the chip style it defines a few values
which reference the match buttes and the

00:10:35.550 --> 00:10:35.560
which reference the match buttes and the
 

00:10:35.560 --> 00:10:37.170
which reference the match buttes and the
power of this design comes from the fact

00:10:37.170 --> 00:10:37.180
power of this design comes from the fact
 

00:10:37.180 --> 00:10:39.330
power of this design comes from the fact
that other styles in our library can

00:10:39.330 --> 00:10:39.340
that other styles in our library can
 

00:10:39.340 --> 00:10:40.920
that other styles in our library can
reference these same attributes so

00:10:40.920 --> 00:10:40.930
reference these same attributes so
 

00:10:40.930 --> 00:10:43.410
reference these same attributes so
here's an example of a button and both

00:10:43.410 --> 00:10:43.420
here's an example of a button and both
 

00:10:43.420 --> 00:10:45.690
here's an example of a button and both
of these have the same shape appearance

00:10:45.690 --> 00:10:45.700
of these have the same shape appearance
 

00:10:45.700 --> 00:10:47.970
of these have the same shape appearance
which is the small component shape

00:10:47.970 --> 00:10:47.980
which is the small component shape
 

00:10:47.980 --> 00:10:50.430
which is the small component shape
appearance that means that if we want to

00:10:50.430 --> 00:10:50.440
appearance that means that if we want to
 

00:10:50.440 --> 00:10:52.770
appearance that means that if we want to
update the look and feel of our app for

00:10:52.770 --> 00:10:52.780
update the look and feel of our app for
 

00:10:52.780 --> 00:10:54.990
update the look and feel of our app for
these shape for these small components

00:10:54.990 --> 00:10:55.000
these shape for these small components
 

00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:56.850
these shape for these small components
all we have to do is update this

00:10:56.850 --> 00:10:56.860
all we have to do is update this
 

00:10:56.860 --> 00:10:59.340
all we have to do is update this
attribute in one place in our theme and

00:10:59.340 --> 00:10:59.350
attribute in one place in our theme and
 

00:10:59.350 --> 00:11:01.290
attribute in one place in our theme and
we'll show you an example of how to do

00:11:01.290 --> 00:11:01.300
we'll show you an example of how to do
 

00:11:01.300 --> 00:11:04.220
we'll show you an example of how to do
that in a little bit

00:11:04.220 --> 00:11:04.230
 
 

00:11:04.230 --> 00:11:06.480
 
what are the effects of each of these

00:11:06.480 --> 00:11:06.490
what are the effects of each of these
 

00:11:06.490 --> 00:11:08.610
what are the effects of each of these
theme attributes unfortunately it's not

00:11:08.610 --> 00:11:08.620
theme attributes unfortunately it's not
 

00:11:08.620 --> 00:11:11.009
theme attributes unfortunately it's not
totally straightforward we try to apply

00:11:11.009 --> 00:11:11.019
totally straightforward we try to apply
 

00:11:11.019 --> 00:11:12.629
totally straightforward we try to apply
theme attributes in a way that will make

00:11:12.629 --> 00:11:12.639
theme attributes in a way that will make
 

00:11:12.639 --> 00:11:15.809
theme attributes in a way that will make
sense but it's definitely possible for

00:11:15.809 --> 00:11:15.819
sense but it's definitely possible for
 

00:11:15.819 --> 00:11:17.400
sense but it's definitely possible for
you to pick values for like different

00:11:17.400 --> 00:11:17.410
you to pick values for like different
 

00:11:17.410 --> 00:11:20.239
you to pick values for like different
colors that may not look great together

00:11:20.239 --> 00:11:20.249
colors that may not look great together
 

00:11:20.249 --> 00:11:22.470
colors that may not look great together
you should probably check out material

00:11:22.470 --> 00:11:22.480
you should probably check out material
 

00:11:22.480 --> 00:11:24.449
you should probably check out material
do for each component to see how it'll

00:11:24.449 --> 00:11:24.459
do for each component to see how it'll
 

00:11:24.459 --> 00:11:27.090
do for each component to see how it'll
react but another simple possible

00:11:27.090 --> 00:11:27.100
react but another simple possible
 

00:11:27.100 --> 00:11:29.400
react but another simple possible
another simple solution that you could

00:11:29.400 --> 00:11:29.410
another simple solution that you could
 

00:11:29.410 --> 00:11:31.769
another simple solution that you could
do potentially is to make like a debug

00:11:31.769 --> 00:11:31.779
do potentially is to make like a debug
 

00:11:31.779 --> 00:11:34.049
do potentially is to make like a debug
theme which just says sets wacky values

00:11:34.049 --> 00:11:34.059
theme which just says sets wacky values
 

00:11:34.059 --> 00:11:36.210
theme which just says sets wacky values
to different attributes and then see how

00:11:36.210 --> 00:11:36.220
to different attributes and then see how
 

00:11:36.220 --> 00:11:38.910
to different attributes and then see how
things look but for instance here's the

00:11:38.910 --> 00:11:38.920
things look but for instance here's the
 

00:11:38.920 --> 00:11:42.179
things look but for instance here's the
bottom map bar a page on the material I

00:11:42.179 --> 00:11:42.189
bottom map bar a page on the material I
 

00:11:42.189 --> 00:11:47.420
bottom map bar a page on the material I
of site and you can see there that the

00:11:47.420 --> 00:11:47.430
of site and you can see there that the
 

00:11:47.430 --> 00:11:50.460
of site and you can see there that the
the container itself is like a surface

00:11:50.460 --> 00:11:50.470
the container itself is like a surface
 

00:11:50.470 --> 00:11:55.970
the container itself is like a surface
and the icons or the on surface and

00:11:55.970 --> 00:11:55.980
and the icons or the on surface and
 

00:11:55.980 --> 00:11:58.139
and the icons or the on surface and
we'll talk about which attributes you

00:11:58.139 --> 00:11:58.149
we'll talk about which attributes you
 

00:11:58.149 --> 00:12:00.030
we'll talk about which attributes you
can modify as well as things to look out

00:12:00.030 --> 00:12:00.040
can modify as well as things to look out
 

00:12:00.040 --> 00:12:01.670
can modify as well as things to look out
for in the next section

00:12:01.670 --> 00:12:01.680
for in the next section
 

00:12:01.680 --> 00:12:05.579
for in the next section
so theming subsystems we currently have

00:12:05.579 --> 00:12:05.589
so theming subsystems we currently have
 

00:12:05.589 --> 00:12:08.699
so theming subsystems we currently have
three theming subsystems type color and

00:12:08.699 --> 00:12:08.709
three theming subsystems type color and
 

00:12:08.709 --> 00:12:10.739
three theming subsystems type color and
shape and these are the knobs that you

00:12:10.739 --> 00:12:10.749
shape and these are the knobs that you
 

00:12:10.749 --> 00:12:13.259
shape and these are the knobs that you
as a developer should tweak in order to

00:12:13.259 --> 00:12:13.269
as a developer should tweak in order to
 

00:12:13.269 --> 00:12:17.040
as a developer should tweak in order to
theme your app hopefully most of you are

00:12:17.040 --> 00:12:17.050
theme your app hopefully most of you are
 

00:12:17.050 --> 00:12:19.860
theme your app hopefully most of you are
familiar with text appearances but we've

00:12:19.860 --> 00:12:19.870
familiar with text appearances but we've
 

00:12:19.870 --> 00:12:22.499
familiar with text appearances but we've
incorporated material theming which uses

00:12:22.499 --> 00:12:22.509
incorporated material theming which uses
 

00:12:22.509 --> 00:12:26.460
incorporated material theming which uses
theme attributes to reference these text

00:12:26.460 --> 00:12:26.470
theme attributes to reference these text
 

00:12:26.470 --> 00:12:28.949
theme attributes to reference these text
appearances so here's an example of a

00:12:28.949 --> 00:12:28.959
appearances so here's an example of a
 

00:12:28.959 --> 00:12:31.009
appearances so here's an example of a
tool bar which uses the headlines

00:12:31.009 --> 00:12:31.019
tool bar which uses the headlines
 

00:12:31.019 --> 00:12:34.340
tool bar which uses the headlines
headlines six attribute rather than

00:12:34.340 --> 00:12:34.350
headlines six attribute rather than
 

00:12:34.350 --> 00:12:38.579
headlines six attribute rather than
style directly and here's some copy that

00:12:38.579 --> 00:12:38.589
style directly and here's some copy that
 

00:12:38.589 --> 00:12:41.819
style directly and here's some copy that
uses the body 1 attribute these are the

00:12:41.819 --> 00:12:41.829
uses the body 1 attribute these are the
 

00:12:41.829 --> 00:12:44.910
uses the body 1 attribute these are the
type attributes that we've defined so if

00:12:44.910 --> 00:12:44.920
type attributes that we've defined so if
 

00:12:44.920 --> 00:12:46.739
type attributes that we've defined so if
you override any of these in your theme

00:12:46.739 --> 00:12:46.749
you override any of these in your theme
 

00:12:46.749 --> 00:12:50.369
you override any of these in your theme
you can set the style and look of your

00:12:50.369 --> 00:12:50.379
you can set the style and look of your
 

00:12:50.379 --> 00:12:55.590
you can set the style and look of your
app color is another one and you're

00:12:55.590 --> 00:12:55.600
app color is another one and you're
 

00:12:55.600 --> 00:12:57.449
app color is another one and you're
probably familiar with the app compat

00:12:57.449 --> 00:12:57.459
probably familiar with the app compat
 

00:12:57.459 --> 00:13:00.150

color primary and color accent from
material theming we have a wider range

00:13:02.460 --> 00:13:02.470
material theming we have a wider range
 

00:13:02.470 --> 00:13:04.679
material theming we have a wider range
of colors so that you have more control

00:13:04.679 --> 00:13:04.689
of colors so that you have more control
 

00:13:04.689 --> 00:13:06.119
of colors so that you have more control
over the color of different parts of

00:13:06.119 --> 00:13:06.129
over the color of different parts of
 

00:13:06.129 --> 00:13:09.239
over the color of different parts of
your app these are the semantic names of

00:13:09.239 --> 00:13:09.249
your app these are the semantic names of
 

00:13:09.249 --> 00:13:11.579
your app these are the semantic names of
the expanded pallet of colors that work

00:13:11.579 --> 00:13:11.589
the expanded pallet of colors that work
 

00:13:11.589 --> 00:13:14.879
the expanded pallet of colors that work
with color of theming on the top here we

00:13:14.879 --> 00:13:14.889
with color of theming on the top here we
 

00:13:14.889 --> 00:13:16.949
with color of theming on the top here we
have primary primary variants secondary

00:13:16.949 --> 00:13:16.959
have primary primary variants secondary
 

00:13:16.959 --> 00:13:17.790
have primary primary variants secondary
secondary very

00:13:17.790 --> 00:13:17.800
secondary very
 

00:13:17.800 --> 00:13:21.180
secondary very
those are all the brand colors those are

00:13:21.180 --> 00:13:21.190
those are all the brand colors those are
 

00:13:21.190 --> 00:13:22.970
those are all the brand colors those are
the things that you should generally

00:13:22.970 --> 00:13:22.980
the things that you should generally
 

00:13:22.980 --> 00:13:26.220
the things that you should generally
seem to be the style of your app there's

00:13:26.220 --> 00:13:26.230
seem to be the style of your app there's
 

00:13:26.230 --> 00:13:27.810
seem to be the style of your app there's
also a background surface and error

00:13:27.810 --> 00:13:27.820
also a background surface and error
 

00:13:27.820 --> 00:13:30.509
also a background surface and error
colors you can style those but you don't

00:13:30.509 --> 00:13:30.519
colors you can style those but you don't
 

00:13:30.519 --> 00:13:33.420
colors you can style those but you don't
necessarily have to and then the on

00:13:33.420 --> 00:13:33.430
necessarily have to and then the on
 

00:13:33.430 --> 00:13:36.269
necessarily have to and then the on
primary on secondary those on variant of

00:13:36.269 --> 00:13:36.279
primary on secondary those on variant of
 

00:13:36.279 --> 00:13:38.790
primary on secondary those on variant of
colors those need to be accessible when

00:13:38.790 --> 00:13:38.800
colors those need to be accessible when
 

00:13:38.800 --> 00:13:41.880
colors those need to be accessible when
they're drawn on top of the other colors

00:13:41.880 --> 00:13:41.890
they're drawn on top of the other colors
 

00:13:41.890 --> 00:13:44.190
they're drawn on top of the other colors
so for instance on primary that will be

00:13:44.190 --> 00:13:44.200
so for instance on primary that will be
 

00:13:44.200 --> 00:13:47.160
so for instance on primary that will be
drawn on top of the primary color so if

00:13:47.160 --> 00:13:47.170
drawn on top of the primary color so if
 

00:13:47.170 --> 00:13:48.720
drawn on top of the primary color so if
you have text that's shown on top of the

00:13:48.720 --> 00:13:48.730
you have text that's shown on top of the
 

00:13:48.730 --> 00:13:51.780
you have text that's shown on top of the
primary background it should be the on

00:13:51.780 --> 00:13:51.790
primary background it should be the on
 

00:13:51.790 --> 00:13:55.800
primary background it should be the on
primary color these are the color

00:13:55.800 --> 00:13:55.810
primary color these are the color
 

00:13:55.810 --> 00:13:58.440
primary color these are the color
attributes that we've defined you can

00:13:58.440 --> 00:13:58.450
attributes that we've defined you can
 

00:13:58.450 --> 00:14:00.900
attributes that we've defined you can
see that there's a lot of new ones we

00:14:00.900 --> 00:14:00.910
see that there's a lot of new ones we
 

00:14:00.910 --> 00:14:02.970
see that there's a lot of new ones we
tried to reuse some that came from app

00:14:02.970 --> 00:14:02.980
tried to reuse some that came from app
 

00:14:02.980 --> 00:14:05.370
tried to reuse some that came from app
compat and we also have the Android

00:14:05.370 --> 00:14:05.380
compat and we also have the Android
 

00:14:05.380 --> 00:14:07.380
compat and we also have the Android
color background that we use as just

00:14:07.380 --> 00:14:07.390
color background that we use as just
 

00:14:07.390 --> 00:14:08.819
color background that we use as just
which is just the regular Android

00:14:08.819 --> 00:14:08.829
which is just the regular Android
 

00:14:08.829 --> 00:14:12.269
which is just the regular Android
version of that attribute shape is

00:14:12.269 --> 00:14:12.279
version of that attribute shape is
 

00:14:12.279 --> 00:14:15.660
version of that attribute shape is
another subsystem that you can theme and

00:14:15.660 --> 00:14:15.670
another subsystem that you can theme and
 

00:14:15.670 --> 00:14:18.000
another subsystem that you can theme and
it all happens with material shape

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:18.010
it all happens with material shape
 

00:14:18.010 --> 00:14:20.940
it all happens with material shape
drawable so we're adding material shape

00:14:20.940 --> 00:14:20.950
drawable so we're adding material shape
 

00:14:20.950 --> 00:14:23.010
drawable so we're adding material shape
drawable as the background for shape the

00:14:23.010 --> 00:14:23.020
drawable as the background for shape the
 

00:14:23.020 --> 00:14:25.199

etc and the way it works is with edge
 

00:14:31.149 --> 00:14:33.960
etc and the way it works is with edge
and corner treatments so we have edge

00:14:33.960 --> 00:14:33.970
and corner treatments so we have edge
 

00:14:33.970 --> 00:14:35.730
and corner treatments so we have edge
and corner treatments defined for

00:14:35.730 --> 00:14:35.740
and corner treatments defined for
 

00:14:35.740 --> 00:14:38.670
and corner treatments defined for
rounded and cut corner which is pretty

00:14:38.670 --> 00:14:38.680
rounded and cut corner which is pretty
 

00:14:38.680 --> 00:14:41.220

can always create your own as well so

00:14:48.180 --> 00:14:48.190
can always create your own as well so
 

00:14:48.190 --> 00:14:51.050
can always create your own as well so
here's an example of Kotlin code which

00:14:51.050 --> 00:14:51.060
here's an example of Kotlin code which
 

00:14:51.060 --> 00:14:54.090
here's an example of Kotlin code which
defines a rounded corner treatment and

00:14:54.090 --> 00:14:54.100
defines a rounded corner treatment and
 

00:14:54.100 --> 00:14:56.490
defines a rounded corner treatment and
sets that to the material shape drawable

00:14:56.490 --> 00:14:56.500
sets that to the material shape drawable
 

00:14:56.500 --> 00:14:58.740
sets that to the material shape drawable
to apply just rounded corners to

00:14:58.740 --> 00:14:58.750
to apply just rounded corners to
 

00:14:58.750 --> 00:15:01.530
to apply just rounded corners to
everything and here is the xml version

00:15:01.530 --> 00:15:01.540
everything and here is the xml version
 

00:15:01.540 --> 00:15:05.760
everything and here is the xml version
as well so if you want to do it in xml

00:15:05.760 --> 00:15:05.770
as well so if you want to do it in xml
 

00:15:05.770 --> 00:15:07.710
as well so if you want to do it in xml
we have a new attribute called shape

00:15:07.710 --> 00:15:07.720
we have a new attribute called shape
 

00:15:07.720 --> 00:15:11.639
we have a new attribute called shape

00:15:14.110 --> 00:15:15.780
appearance of attributes here are the
corner family and the corner size and

00:15:15.780 --> 00:15:15.790
corner family and the corner size and
 

00:15:15.790 --> 00:15:18.060
corner family and the corner size and
this sets it to be a rounded corner with

00:15:18.060 --> 00:15:18.070
this sets it to be a rounded corner with
 

00:15:18.070 --> 00:15:24.449
this sets it to be a rounded corner with
24 DP radius and you can override

00:15:24.449 --> 00:15:24.459
24 DP radius and you can override
 

00:15:24.459 --> 00:15:26.430
24 DP radius and you can override
individual corners so here we're just

00:15:26.430 --> 00:15:26.440
individual corners so here we're just
 

00:15:26.440 --> 00:15:28.530
individual corners so here we're just
overriding the top-left corner to be cut

00:15:28.530 --> 00:15:28.540
overriding the top-left corner to be cut
 

00:15:28.540 --> 00:15:30.319
overriding the top-left corner to be cut
in the bottom right corner to have a

00:15:30.319 --> 00:15:30.329
in the bottom right corner to have a
 

00:15:30.329 --> 00:15:32.329
in the bottom right corner to have a
corner size of zero and you can do the

00:15:32.329 --> 00:15:32.339
corner size of zero and you can do the
 

00:15:32.339 --> 00:15:34.819
corner size of zero and you can do the
same thing in XML and one thing to

00:15:34.819 --> 00:15:34.829
same thing in XML and one thing to
 

00:15:34.829 --> 00:15:36.739
same thing in XML and one thing to
notice is that we're using a shape

00:15:36.739 --> 00:15:36.749
notice is that we're using a shape
 

00:15:36.749 --> 00:15:38.419
notice is that we're using a shape
appearance overlay here which is

00:15:38.419 --> 00:15:38.429
appearance overlay here which is
 

00:15:38.429 --> 00:15:41.150
appearance overlay here which is
basically the same thing except for we

00:15:41.150 --> 00:15:41.160
basically the same thing except for we
 

00:15:41.160 --> 00:15:44.179
basically the same thing except for we
only define the attributes that we want

00:15:44.179 --> 00:15:44.189
only define the attributes that we want
 

00:15:44.189 --> 00:15:47.119
only define the attributes that we want
to override so it's similar to a theme

00:15:47.119 --> 00:15:47.129
to override so it's similar to a theme
 

00:15:47.129 --> 00:15:49.999
to override so it's similar to a theme
overlay and that the material button on

00:15:49.999 --> 00:15:50.009
overlay and that the material button on
 

00:15:50.009 --> 00:15:51.619
overlay and that the material button on
its own already has a shape appearance

00:15:51.619 --> 00:15:51.629
its own already has a shape appearance
 

00:15:51.629 --> 00:15:53.479
its own already has a shape appearance
by default and here we're just setting

00:15:53.479 --> 00:15:53.489
by default and here we're just setting
 

00:15:53.489 --> 00:15:55.939
by default and here we're just setting
the top left corner to be cut and the

00:15:55.939 --> 00:15:55.949
the top left corner to be cut and the
 

00:15:55.949 --> 00:15:58.400
the top left corner to be cut and the
bottom right corner to be 0dp everything

00:15:58.400 --> 00:15:58.410
bottom right corner to be 0dp everything
 

00:15:58.410 --> 00:16:00.470
bottom right corner to be 0dp everything
else will be inherited from the style of

00:16:00.470 --> 00:16:00.480
else will be inherited from the style of
 

00:16:00.480 --> 00:16:04.549
else will be inherited from the style of
the material button one key idea of

00:16:04.549 --> 00:16:04.559
the material button one key idea of
 

00:16:04.559 --> 00:16:06.530
the material button one key idea of
material theming is to add consistency

00:16:06.530 --> 00:16:06.540
material theming is to add consistency
 

00:16:06.540 --> 00:16:08.509
material theming is to add consistency
to your app so we've defined these shape

00:16:08.509 --> 00:16:08.519
to your app so we've defined these shape
 

00:16:08.519 --> 00:16:10.699
to your app so we've defined these shape
mappings to help these are different

00:16:10.699 --> 00:16:10.709
mappings to help these are different
 

00:16:10.709 --> 00:16:13.039
mappings to help these are different
groups of components that can help give

00:16:13.039 --> 00:16:13.049
groups of components that can help give
 

00:16:13.049 --> 00:16:15.499
groups of components that can help give
your app a more consistent looking feel

00:16:15.499 --> 00:16:15.509
your app a more consistent looking feel
 

00:16:15.509 --> 00:16:18.169
your app a more consistent looking feel
by connecting surfaces through shape so

00:16:18.169 --> 00:16:18.179
by connecting surfaces through shape so
 

00:16:18.179 --> 00:16:19.840
by connecting surfaces through shape so
there's small medium and large

00:16:19.840 --> 00:16:19.850
there's small medium and large
 

00:16:19.850 --> 00:16:23.119
there's small medium and large
components and these are the attributes

00:16:23.119 --> 00:16:23.129
components and these are the attributes
 

00:16:23.129 --> 00:16:26.030
components and these are the attributes
that you can set in your theme so if you

00:16:26.030 --> 00:16:26.040
that you can set in your theme so if you
 

00:16:26.040 --> 00:16:28.189
that you can set in your theme so if you
want to restyle all the small components

00:16:28.189 --> 00:16:28.199
want to restyle all the small components
 

00:16:28.199 --> 00:16:30.829
want to restyle all the small components
to have a cut right corner or something

00:16:30.829 --> 00:16:30.839
to have a cut right corner or something
 

00:16:30.839 --> 00:16:35.949
to have a cut right corner or something
you can do that here's an example where

00:16:35.949 --> 00:16:35.959
you can do that here's an example where
 

00:16:35.959 --> 00:16:39.229
you can do that here's an example where
just like I said we're overriding the

00:16:39.229 --> 00:16:39.239
just like I said we're overriding the
 

00:16:39.239 --> 00:16:44.030
just like I said we're overriding the
small component style so we redefine the

00:16:44.030 --> 00:16:44.040
small component style so we redefine the
 

00:16:44.040 --> 00:16:47.600
small component style so we redefine the
small appearance the small component

00:16:47.600 --> 00:16:47.610
small appearance the small component
 

00:16:47.610 --> 00:16:49.909
small appearance the small component
shape appearance and the theme to our

00:16:49.909 --> 00:16:49.919
shape appearance and the theme to our
 

00:16:49.919 --> 00:16:53.119
shape appearance and the theme to our
style and here we're setting the top

00:16:53.119 --> 00:16:53.129
style and here we're setting the top
 

00:16:53.129 --> 00:16:56.119
style and here we're setting the top
right corner to be cut and we're also

00:16:56.119 --> 00:16:56.129
right corner to be cut and we're also
 

00:16:56.129 --> 00:16:58.009
right corner to be cut and we're also
setting the parent here so that will

00:16:58.009 --> 00:16:58.019
setting the parent here so that will
 

00:16:58.019 --> 00:17:00.979
setting the parent here so that will
inherit all of the other the rounded

00:17:00.979 --> 00:17:00.989
inherit all of the other the rounded
 

00:17:00.989 --> 00:17:05.389
inherit all of the other the rounded
corners for the other parts shadow is

00:17:05.389 --> 00:17:05.399
corners for the other parts shadow is
 

00:17:05.399 --> 00:17:06.529
corners for the other parts shadow is
something that we want to mention as

00:17:06.529 --> 00:17:06.539
something that we want to mention as
 

00:17:06.539 --> 00:17:07.669
something that we want to mention as
well

00:17:07.669 --> 00:17:07.679

shapes on lollipop for API 21 and up but
 

00:17:14.279 --> 00:17:19.159
shapes on lollipop for API 21 and up but
we're back porting shadows to API 15 for

00:17:19.159 --> 00:17:19.169
we're back porting shadows to API 15 for
 

00:17:19.169 --> 00:17:21.919
we're back porting shadows to API 15 for
both concave and convex shape shapes for

00:17:21.919 --> 00:17:21.929
both concave and convex shape shapes for
 

00:17:21.929 --> 00:17:24.439
both concave and convex shape shapes for
common cases such as rounded or cut

00:17:24.439 --> 00:17:24.449
common cases such as rounded or cut

bar because this has the cut out inside

00:17:30.799 --> 00:17:30.809
bar because this has the cut out inside
 

00:17:30.809 --> 00:17:33.500
bar because this has the cut out inside
of it it won't get in native shadow so

00:17:33.500 --> 00:17:33.510
of it it won't get in native shadow so
 

00:17:33.510 --> 00:17:38.810
of it it won't get in native shadow so
we fake the shadow with a gradient so

00:17:38.810 --> 00:17:38.820
we fake the shadow with a gradient so
 

00:17:38.820 --> 00:17:40.340
we fake the shadow with a gradient so
now that we've heard a bit about our

00:17:40.340 --> 00:17:40.350
now that we've heard a bit about our
 

00:17:40.350 --> 00:17:42.019
now that we've heard a bit about our
gaming subsystems let's look at how to

00:17:42.019 --> 00:17:42.029
gaming subsystems let's look at how to
 

00:17:42.029 --> 00:17:43.640
gaming subsystems let's look at how to
actually apply those to your out

00:17:43.640 --> 00:17:43.650
actually apply those to your out
 

00:17:43.650 --> 00:17:46.080
actually apply those to your out
so coming back to the scenario again say

00:17:46.080 --> 00:17:46.090
so coming back to the scenario again say
 

00:17:46.090 --> 00:17:48.000
so coming back to the scenario again say
you have this app compat app that you

00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:48.010
you have this app compat app that you
 

00:17:48.010 --> 00:17:49.530
you have this app compat app that you
want to apply some of these theming

00:17:49.530 --> 00:17:49.540
want to apply some of these theming
 

00:17:49.540 --> 00:17:51.539
want to apply some of these theming
subsystems to so we're gonna be building

00:17:51.539 --> 00:17:51.549
subsystems to so we're gonna be building
 

00:17:51.549 --> 00:17:53.190
subsystems to so we're gonna be building
something that looks a little like this

00:17:53.190 --> 00:17:53.200
something that looks a little like this
 

00:17:53.200 --> 00:17:55.110
something that looks a little like this
and obviously when you build your own

00:17:55.110 --> 00:17:55.120
and obviously when you build your own
 

00:17:55.120 --> 00:17:57.060
and obviously when you build your own
apps it'll look much more beautiful and

00:17:57.060 --> 00:17:57.070
apps it'll look much more beautiful and
 

00:17:57.070 --> 00:17:59.520
apps it'll look much more beautiful and
cohesive than this but we're tweaking as

00:17:59.520 --> 00:17:59.530
cohesive than this but we're tweaking as
 

00:17:59.530 --> 00:18:01.260
cohesive than this but we're tweaking as
many knobs as we can to show you some of

00:18:01.260 --> 00:18:01.270
many knobs as we can to show you some of
 

00:18:01.270 --> 00:18:03.510
many knobs as we can to show you some of
the functionality what we built Oh

00:18:03.510 --> 00:18:03.520
the functionality what we built Oh
 

00:18:03.520 --> 00:18:05.700
the functionality what we built Oh
so first thing you'd have to do is if

00:18:05.700 --> 00:18:05.710
so first thing you'd have to do is if
 

00:18:05.710 --> 00:18:07.230
so first thing you'd have to do is if
you're using an app compat light no

00:18:07.230 --> 00:18:07.240
you're using an app compat light no
 

00:18:07.240 --> 00:18:09.240
you're using an app compat light no
action bar theme you can switch over its

00:18:09.240 --> 00:18:09.250
action bar theme you can switch over its
 

00:18:09.250 --> 00:18:11.190
action bar theme you can switch over its
a material components theme and in this

00:18:11.190 --> 00:18:11.200
a material components theme and in this
 

00:18:11.200 --> 00:18:12.450
a material components theme and in this
case you'll notice we're using the

00:18:12.450 --> 00:18:12.460
case you'll notice we're using the
 

00:18:12.460 --> 00:18:14.400
case you'll notice we're using the
bridge theme because we want to opt into

00:18:14.400 --> 00:18:14.410
bridge theme because we want to opt into
 

00:18:14.410 --> 00:18:16.799
bridge theme because we want to opt into
using those components one by one but

00:18:16.799 --> 00:18:16.809
using those components one by one but
 

00:18:16.809 --> 00:18:18.390
using those components one by one but
generally recommend that you switch to

00:18:18.390 --> 00:18:18.400
generally recommend that you switch to
 

00:18:18.400 --> 00:18:20.430
generally recommend that you switch to
the full theme the regular theme and see

00:18:20.430 --> 00:18:20.440
the full theme the regular theme and see
 

00:18:20.440 --> 00:18:22.020
the full theme the regular theme and see
how it looks first before trying out the

00:18:22.020 --> 00:18:22.030
how it looks first before trying out the
 

00:18:22.030 --> 00:18:26.549
how it looks first before trying out the
bridge theme um so let's say first thing

00:18:26.549 --> 00:18:26.559
bridge theme um so let's say first thing
 

00:18:26.559 --> 00:18:29.070
bridge theme um so let's say first thing
you do is you set these theme color

00:18:29.070 --> 00:18:29.080
you do is you set these theme color
 

00:18:29.080 --> 00:18:30.990
you do is you set these theme color
attributes so some of the existing ones

00:18:30.990 --> 00:18:31.000
attributes so some of the existing ones
 

00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:32.310
attributes so some of the existing ones
that you already know or a color primary

00:18:32.310 --> 00:18:32.320
that you already know or a color primary
 

00:18:32.320 --> 00:18:34.620
that you already know or a color primary
in color secondary those still exist and

00:18:34.620 --> 00:18:34.630
in color secondary those still exist and
 

00:18:34.630 --> 00:18:36.030
in color secondary those still exist and
then some of the new theme color

00:18:36.030 --> 00:18:36.040
then some of the new theme color
 

00:18:36.040 --> 00:18:37.890
then some of the new theme color
attributes such as color on primary on

00:18:37.890 --> 00:18:37.900
attributes such as color on primary on
 

00:18:37.900 --> 00:18:40.080
attributes such as color on primary on
secondary color surface and color on

00:18:40.080 --> 00:18:40.090
secondary color surface and color on
 

00:18:40.090 --> 00:18:42.360
secondary color surface and color on
surface are also set you'll see this

00:18:42.360 --> 00:18:42.370
surface are also set you'll see this
 

00:18:42.370 --> 00:18:43.770
surface are also set you'll see this
color secondary doesn't really show up

00:18:43.770 --> 00:18:43.780
color secondary doesn't really show up
 

00:18:43.780 --> 00:18:47.060
color secondary doesn't really show up
anywhere in your app yet but it will

00:18:47.060 --> 00:18:47.070
anywhere in your app yet but it will
 

00:18:47.070 --> 00:18:50.100
anywhere in your app yet but it will
next thing we want to do is get material

00:18:50.100 --> 00:18:50.110
next thing we want to do is get material
 

00:18:50.110 --> 00:18:51.330
next thing we want to do is get material
button so before we have those app

00:18:51.330 --> 00:18:51.340
button so before we have those app
 

00:18:51.340 --> 00:18:53.310
button so before we have those app
compat buttons and then if you set the

00:18:53.310 --> 00:18:53.320
compat buttons and then if you set the
 

00:18:53.320 --> 00:18:55.799
compat buttons and then if you set the
material button style in your theme all

00:18:55.799 --> 00:18:55.809
material button style in your theme all
 

00:18:55.809 --> 00:18:58.409
material button style in your theme all

using our full theme this inflation
happens automatically so you don't

happens automatically so you don't
 

00:19:05.500 --> 00:19:08.510
happens automatically so you don't
actually have to change this XML at all

00:19:08.510 --> 00:19:08.520
actually have to change this XML at all
 

00:19:08.520 --> 00:19:10.890
actually have to change this XML at all
we have a bunch of other default styles

00:19:10.890 --> 00:19:10.900
we have a bunch of other default styles
 

00:19:10.900 --> 00:19:12.419
we have a bunch of other default styles
that we've laid out here all our

00:19:12.419 --> 00:19:12.429
that we've laid out here all our
 

00:19:12.429 --> 00:19:13.890
that we've laid out here all our
components have a default style that you

00:19:13.890 --> 00:19:13.900
components have a default style that you
 

00:19:13.900 --> 00:19:15.720
components have a default style that you
can set in the theme it's generally just

00:19:15.720 --> 00:19:15.730
can set in the theme it's generally just
 

00:19:15.730 --> 00:19:20.070
can set in the theme it's generally just
component name plus style for example if

00:19:20.070 --> 00:19:20.080
component name plus style for example if
 

00:19:20.080 --> 00:19:21.720
component name plus style for example if
you want to set the card style you would

00:19:21.720 --> 00:19:21.730
you want to set the card style you would
 

00:19:21.730 --> 00:19:23.039
you want to set the card style you would
set material card view style in your

00:19:23.039 --> 00:19:23.049
set material card view style in your
 

00:19:23.049 --> 00:19:24.780
set material card view style in your
theme and then we're going to be

00:19:24.780 --> 00:19:24.790
theme and then we're going to be
 

00:19:24.790 --> 00:19:27.090
theme and then we're going to be
applying so you should also change the

00:19:27.090 --> 00:19:27.100
applying so you should also change the
 

00:19:27.100 --> 00:19:28.440
applying so you should also change the
card view to material card view in this

00:19:28.440 --> 00:19:28.450
card view to material card view in this
 

00:19:28.450 --> 00:19:30.930
card view to material card view in this
case in your XML and then we're going to

00:19:30.930 --> 00:19:30.940
case in your XML and then we're going to
 

00:19:30.940 --> 00:19:32.460
case in your XML and then we're going to
be applying some attributes to these

00:19:32.460 --> 00:19:32.470
be applying some attributes to these
 

00:19:32.470 --> 00:19:34.560
be applying some attributes to these
cards so for instance you can set card

00:19:34.560 --> 00:19:34.570
cards so for instance you can set card
 

00:19:34.570 --> 00:19:36.720
cards so for instance you can set card
elevation stroke color and stroke width

00:19:36.720 --> 00:19:36.730
elevation stroke color and stroke width
 

00:19:36.730 --> 00:19:38.760
elevation stroke color and stroke width
and that'll show up across all of your

00:19:38.760 --> 00:19:38.770
and that'll show up across all of your
 

00:19:38.770 --> 00:19:40.590
and that'll show up across all of your
cards because it's setting the default

00:19:40.590 --> 00:19:40.600
cards because it's setting the default
 

00:19:40.600 --> 00:19:42.210
cards because it's setting the default
style and also all the cards look at

00:19:42.210 --> 00:19:42.220
style and also all the cards look at
 

00:19:42.220 --> 00:19:45.810
style and also all the cards look at
this default style and then say you

00:19:45.810 --> 00:19:45.820
this default style and then say you
 

00:19:45.820 --> 00:19:48.030
this default style and then say you
wanted to change the base style of all

00:19:48.030 --> 00:19:48.040
wanted to change the base style of all
 

00:19:48.040 --> 00:19:50.250
wanted to change the base style of all
the buttons you would define your own

00:19:50.250 --> 00:19:50.260
the buttons you would define your own
 

00:19:50.260 --> 00:19:51.990
the buttons you would define your own
button style and set the parents of it

00:19:51.990 --> 00:19:52.000
button style and set the parents of it
 

00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:53.820
button style and set the parents of it
to outline button which is one of our

00:19:53.820 --> 00:19:53.830
to outline button which is one of our
 

00:19:53.830 --> 00:19:55.470
to outline button which is one of our
default cells and then all of your

00:19:55.470 --> 00:19:55.480
default cells and then all of your
 

00:19:55.480 --> 00:19:59.250
default cells and then all of your
buttons change into outline buttons

00:19:59.250 --> 00:19:59.260
 
 

00:19:59.260 --> 00:20:01.080
 
we can now apply some shape theming to

00:20:01.080 --> 00:20:01.090
we can now apply some shape theming to
 

00:20:01.090 --> 00:20:02.370
we can now apply some shape theming to
all of your buttons so we're gonna

00:20:02.370 --> 00:20:02.380
all of your buttons so we're gonna
 

00:20:02.380 --> 00:20:04.620
all of your buttons so we're gonna
define the shape appearance shaped

00:20:04.620 --> 00:20:04.630
define the shape appearance shaped
 

00:20:04.630 --> 00:20:06.780
define the shape appearance shaped
button style and in that button style

00:20:06.780 --> 00:20:06.790
button style and in that button style
 

00:20:06.790 --> 00:20:09.480
button style and in that button style
we're gonna set the right corners to be

00:20:09.480 --> 00:20:09.490
we're gonna set the right corners to be
 

00:20:09.490 --> 00:20:11.310
we're gonna set the right corners to be
cut and the left corner speed round 'add

00:20:11.310 --> 00:20:11.320
cut and the left corner speed round 'add
 

00:20:11.320 --> 00:20:13.290
cut and the left corner speed round 'add
and we're gonna set the corner size and

00:20:13.290 --> 00:20:13.300
and we're gonna set the corner size and
 

00:20:13.300 --> 00:20:17.030
and we're gonna set the corner size and
now you have this arrow shaped button

00:20:17.030 --> 00:20:17.040
now you have this arrow shaped button
 

00:20:17.040 --> 00:20:19.290
now you have this arrow shaped button
you can also do the Stewart using a

00:20:19.290 --> 00:20:19.300
you can also do the Stewart using a
 

00:20:19.300 --> 00:20:21.480
you can also do the Stewart using a
shape appearance overlay since buttons

00:20:21.480 --> 00:20:21.490
shape appearance overlay since buttons
 

00:20:21.490 --> 00:20:23.550
shape appearance overlay since buttons
have a rounded corner by default you

00:20:23.550 --> 00:20:23.560
have a rounded corner by default you
 

00:20:23.560 --> 00:20:25.050
have a rounded corner by default you
don't really have to set the rounded

00:20:25.050 --> 00:20:25.060
don't really have to set the rounded
 

00:20:25.060 --> 00:20:27.090
don't really have to set the rounded
corner for the left side so if you use

00:20:27.090 --> 00:20:27.100
corner for the left side so if you use
 

00:20:27.100 --> 00:20:28.200
corner for the left side so if you use
the shape appearance overlay you can

00:20:28.200 --> 00:20:28.210
the shape appearance overlay you can
 

00:20:28.210 --> 00:20:30.240
the shape appearance overlay you can
just set what you're changing and it'll

00:20:30.240 --> 00:20:30.250
just set what you're changing and it'll
 

00:20:30.250 --> 00:20:34.500
just set what you're changing and it'll
take effect as normal and then say we

00:20:34.500 --> 00:20:34.510
take effect as normal and then say we
 

00:20:34.510 --> 00:20:36.420
take effect as normal and then say we
wanted to have some icon buttons you

00:20:36.420 --> 00:20:36.430
wanted to have some icon buttons you
 

00:20:36.430 --> 00:20:39.000
wanted to have some icon buttons you
would define this icon button style set

00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:39.010
would define this icon button style set
 

00:20:39.010 --> 00:20:41.030
would define this icon button style set
the padding's and min widths as you want

00:20:41.030 --> 00:20:41.040
the padding's and min widths as you want
 

00:20:41.040 --> 00:20:44.100
the padding's and min widths as you want
and then apply this to yearbut to your

00:20:44.100 --> 00:20:44.110
and then apply this to yearbut to your
 

00:20:44.110 --> 00:20:47.040
and then apply this to yearbut to your
button directly in the xml as well as

00:20:47.040 --> 00:20:47.050
button directly in the xml as well as
 

00:20:47.050 --> 00:20:48.540
button directly in the xml as well as
setting that icon and content

00:20:48.540 --> 00:20:48.550
setting that icon and content
 

00:20:48.550 --> 00:20:50.610
setting that icon and content
description and then you have this share

00:20:50.610 --> 00:20:50.620
description and then you have this share
 

00:20:50.620 --> 00:20:52.740
description and then you have this share
icon button instead of that share text

00:20:52.740 --> 00:20:52.750
icon button instead of that share text
 

00:20:52.750 --> 00:20:57.570
icon button instead of that share text
button you can also switch over to the

00:20:57.570 --> 00:20:57.580
button you can also switch over to the
 

00:20:57.580 --> 00:20:59.940
button you can also switch over to the
bottom app bar so for this you'd have to

00:20:59.940 --> 00:20:59.950
bottom app bar so for this you'd have to
 

00:20:59.950 --> 00:21:01.260
bottom app bar so for this you'd have to
set the bottom app bar style in your

00:21:01.260 --> 00:21:01.270
set the bottom app bar style in your
 

00:21:01.270 --> 00:21:04.350
set the bottom app bar style in your
theme and then remove the top app bar

00:21:04.350 --> 00:21:04.360
theme and then remove the top app bar
 

00:21:04.360 --> 00:21:06.630
theme and then remove the top app bar
from your XML layout and add this bottom

00:21:06.630 --> 00:21:06.640
from your XML layout and add this bottom
 

00:21:06.640 --> 00:21:10.560
from your XML layout and add this bottom
app bar here you can also add a floating

00:21:10.560 --> 00:21:10.570
app bar here you can also add a floating
 

00:21:10.570 --> 00:21:12.120
app bar here you can also add a floating
action button cradled into the spot in

00:21:12.120 --> 00:21:12.130
action button cradled into the spot in
 

00:21:12.130 --> 00:21:14.100
action button cradled into the spot in
that bar by adding the floating action

00:21:14.100 --> 00:21:14.110
that bar by adding the floating action
 

00:21:14.110 --> 00:21:16.260
that bar by adding the floating action
button to your layout and then setting

00:21:16.260 --> 00:21:16.270
button to your layout and then setting
 

00:21:16.270 --> 00:21:18.330
button to your layout and then setting
the layout anchor attribute to point to

00:21:18.330 --> 00:21:18.340
the layout anchor attribute to point to
 

00:21:18.340 --> 00:21:20.460
the layout anchor attribute to point to
the ID at the bottom app bar you'll

00:21:20.460 --> 00:21:20.470
the ID at the bottom app bar you'll
 

00:21:20.470 --> 00:21:21.990
the ID at the bottom app bar you'll
notice that this fab has that teal color

00:21:21.990 --> 00:21:22.000
notice that this fab has that teal color
 

00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:24.690
notice that this fab has that teal color
from app compat and that's because we

00:21:24.690 --> 00:21:24.700
from app compat and that's because we
 

00:21:24.700 --> 00:21:27.390
from app compat and that's because we
haven't set the default floating action

00:21:27.390 --> 00:21:27.400
haven't set the default floating action
 

00:21:27.400 --> 00:21:29.550
haven't set the default floating action
button style yet so once you set that

00:21:29.550 --> 00:21:29.560
button style yet so once you set that
 

00:21:29.560 --> 00:21:31.530
button style yet so once you set that
you'll see that it's now using color

00:21:31.530 --> 00:21:31.540
you'll see that it's now using color
 

00:21:31.540 --> 00:21:34.230
you'll see that it's now using color
secondary and color on secondary and it

00:21:34.230 --> 00:21:34.240
secondary and color on secondary and it
 

00:21:34.240 --> 00:21:39.150
secondary and color on secondary and it
has that ripple effect as well then we

00:21:39.150 --> 00:21:39.160
has that ripple effect as well then we
 

00:21:39.160 --> 00:21:41.820
has that ripple effect as well then we
can do some text styling for the content

00:21:41.820 --> 00:21:41.830
can do some text styling for the content
 

00:21:41.830 --> 00:21:43.590
can do some text styling for the content
of our cards say you want all of your

00:21:43.590 --> 00:21:43.600
of our cards say you want all of your
 

00:21:43.600 --> 00:21:45.870
of our cards say you want all of your
all of your text to be color on surface

00:21:45.870 --> 00:21:45.880
all of your text to be color on surface
 

00:21:45.880 --> 00:21:47.840
all of your text to be color on surface
rather than whatever it was previously

00:21:47.840 --> 00:21:47.850
rather than whatever it was previously
 

00:21:47.850 --> 00:21:49.740
rather than whatever it was previously
we're gonna be using what's called a

00:21:49.740 --> 00:21:49.750
we're gonna be using what's called a
 

00:21:49.750 --> 00:21:51.360
we're gonna be using what's called a
material theme overlay which I'll talk

00:21:51.360 --> 00:21:51.370
material theme overlay which I'll talk
 

00:21:51.370 --> 00:21:53.280
material theme overlay which I'll talk
about in just a second but material

00:21:53.280 --> 00:21:53.290
about in just a second but material
 

00:21:53.290 --> 00:21:54.930
about in just a second but material
theme overlaid pretty much sets the

00:21:54.930 --> 00:21:54.940
theme overlaid pretty much sets the
 

00:21:54.940 --> 00:21:57.150
theme overlaid pretty much sets the
theme for all the contents of that

00:21:57.150 --> 00:21:57.160
theme for all the contents of that
 

00:21:57.160 --> 00:21:59.190
theme for all the contents of that
component so in this case we're setting

00:21:59.190 --> 00:21:59.200
component so in this case we're setting
 

00:21:59.200 --> 00:22:01.500
component so in this case we're setting
the text color primary and tertiary to

00:22:01.500 --> 00:22:01.510
the text color primary and tertiary to
 

00:22:01.510 --> 00:22:03.450
the text color primary and tertiary to
set the text color of our of our notes

00:22:03.450 --> 00:22:03.460
set the text color of our of our notes
 

00:22:03.460 --> 00:22:07.710
set the text color of our of our notes
here and so material theme overlay you

00:22:07.710 --> 00:22:07.720
here and so material theme overlay you
 

00:22:07.720 --> 00:22:08.970
here and so material theme overlay you
might have heard of Android theme it's

00:22:08.970 --> 00:22:08.980
might have heard of Android theme it's
 

00:22:08.980 --> 00:22:10.620
might have heard of Android theme it's
the way you can style a sub section of

00:22:10.620 --> 00:22:10.630
the way you can style a sub section of
 

00:22:10.630 --> 00:22:10.890
the way you can style a sub section of

your
hierarchy and one common usage of this

00:22:13.050 --> 00:22:13.060
hierarchy and one common usage of this
 

00:22:13.060 --> 00:22:15.840
hierarchy and one common usage of this
is style say a dark-colored toolbar in

00:22:15.840 --> 00:22:15.850
is style say a dark-colored toolbar in
 

00:22:15.850 --> 00:22:18.300
is style say a dark-colored toolbar in
your app the shortcoming of Android

00:22:18.300 --> 00:22:18.310
your app the shortcoming of Android
 

00:22:18.310 --> 00:22:20.070
your app the shortcoming of Android
theme is that it doesn't work in default

00:22:20.070 --> 00:22:20.080
theme is that it doesn't work in default
 

00:22:20.080 --> 00:22:21.720
theme is that it doesn't work in default
styles so for instance if you wanted to

00:22:21.720 --> 00:22:21.730
styles so for instance if you wanted to
 

00:22:21.730 --> 00:22:24.600
styles so for instance if you wanted to
style all of your cards you can't really

00:22:24.600 --> 00:22:24.610
style all of your cards you can't really
 

00:22:24.610 --> 00:22:26.460
style all of your cards you can't really
set Android theme so material theme

00:22:26.460 --> 00:22:26.470
set Android theme so material theme
 

00:22:26.470 --> 00:22:27.990
set Android theme so material theme
overlays an attribute that we've defined

00:22:27.990 --> 00:22:28.000
overlays an attribute that we've defined
 

00:22:28.000 --> 00:22:29.730
overlays an attribute that we've defined
that's supported by our components and

00:22:29.730 --> 00:22:29.740
that's supported by our components and
 

00:22:29.740 --> 00:22:31.830
that's supported by our components and
it does work in default styles so you

00:22:31.830 --> 00:22:31.840
it does work in default styles so you
 

00:22:31.840 --> 00:22:33.570
it does work in default styles so you
can set this in your default styles for

00:22:33.570 --> 00:22:33.580
can set this in your default styles for
 

00:22:33.580 --> 00:22:36.900
can set this in your default styles for
your components and have a theme the sub

00:22:36.900 --> 00:22:36.910
your components and have a theme the sub
 

00:22:36.910 --> 00:22:39.410
your components and have a theme the sub
views of your components

00:22:39.410 --> 00:22:39.420
views of your components
 

00:22:39.420 --> 00:22:41.700
views of your components
lastly we'll do some text appearance

00:22:41.700 --> 00:22:41.710
lastly we'll do some text appearance
 

00:22:41.710 --> 00:22:45.330
lastly we'll do some text appearance
theming so previously the title was had

00:22:45.330 --> 00:22:45.340
theming so previously the title was had
 

00:22:45.340 --> 00:22:47.010
theming so previously the title was had
this hard-coded text appear in style now

00:22:47.010 --> 00:22:47.020
this hard-coded text appear in style now
 

00:22:47.020 --> 00:22:49.890
this hard-coded text appear in style now
we're gonna be switching over to our new

00:22:49.890 --> 00:22:49.900
we're gonna be switching over to our new
 

00:22:49.900 --> 00:22:53.040
we're gonna be switching over to our new
text appearance attributes and similarly

00:22:53.040 --> 00:22:53.050
text appearance attributes and similarly
 

00:22:53.050 --> 00:22:55.260
text appearance attributes and similarly
for the for the text for the note body

00:22:55.260 --> 00:22:55.270
for the for the text for the note body
 

00:22:55.270 --> 00:22:59.060
for the for the text for the note body
as well and then we can apply some

00:22:59.060 --> 00:22:59.070
as well and then we can apply some
 

00:22:59.070 --> 00:23:01.440
as well and then we can apply some
styling to this so for example if you

00:23:01.440 --> 00:23:01.450
styling to this so for example if you
 

00:23:01.450 --> 00:23:04.350
styling to this so for example if you
change headline six to be Comic Sans for

00:23:04.350 --> 00:23:04.360
change headline six to be Comic Sans for
 

00:23:04.360 --> 00:23:06.780
change headline six to be Comic Sans for
instance you can change all the

00:23:06.780 --> 00:23:06.790
instance you can change all the
 

00:23:06.790 --> 00:23:08.490
instance you can change all the
components that use headline six in your

00:23:08.490 --> 00:23:08.500
components that use headline six in your
 

00:23:08.500 --> 00:23:14.340
components that use headline six in your
app it should now look like this so why

00:23:14.340 --> 00:23:14.350
app it should now look like this so why
 

00:23:14.350 --> 00:23:15.510
app it should now look like this so why
go through the trouble of doing this

00:23:15.510 --> 00:23:15.520
go through the trouble of doing this
 

00:23:15.520 --> 00:23:16.680
go through the trouble of doing this
like why go through the trouble of like

00:23:16.680 --> 00:23:16.690
like why go through the trouble of like
 

00:23:16.690 --> 00:23:19.050
like why go through the trouble of like
using top-level attributes throughout

00:23:19.050 --> 00:23:19.060
using top-level attributes throughout
 

00:23:19.060 --> 00:23:21.030
using top-level attributes throughout
your Styles like what's what's the

00:23:21.030 --> 00:23:21.040
your Styles like what's what's the
 

00:23:21.040 --> 00:23:23.610
your Styles like what's what's the
reason and generally we do this because

00:23:23.610 --> 00:23:23.620
reason and generally we do this because
 

00:23:23.620 --> 00:23:25.530
reason and generally we do this because
we want to be able to tell your entire

00:23:25.530 --> 00:23:25.540
we want to be able to tell your entire
 

00:23:25.540 --> 00:23:26.790
we want to be able to tell your entire
app using only these top-level

00:23:26.790 --> 00:23:26.800
app using only these top-level
 

00:23:26.800 --> 00:23:29.640
app using only these top-level
attributes so say for instance your

00:23:29.640 --> 00:23:29.650
attributes so say for instance your
 

00:23:29.650 --> 00:23:31.530
attributes so say for instance your
teammate came up to you and said hey our

00:23:31.530 --> 00:23:31.540
teammate came up to you and said hey our
 

00:23:31.540 --> 00:23:33.090
teammate came up to you and said hey our
brand colors are changing now so

00:23:33.090 --> 00:23:33.100
brand colors are changing now so
 

00:23:33.100 --> 00:23:35.910
brand colors are changing now so
actually we want we want this maroon

00:23:35.910 --> 00:23:35.920
actually we want we want this maroon
 

00:23:35.920 --> 00:23:38.250
actually we want we want this maroon
color and so these blues that we had all

00:23:38.250 --> 00:23:38.260
color and so these blues that we had all
 

00:23:38.260 --> 00:23:39.990
color and so these blues that we had all
you have to do is switch some of these

00:23:39.990 --> 00:23:40.000
you have to do is switch some of these
 

00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:42.060
you have to do is switch some of these
top-level color attributes and your

00:23:42.060 --> 00:23:42.070
top-level color attributes and your
 

00:23:42.070 --> 00:23:45.360
top-level color attributes and your
whole app is redeemed similarly if you

00:23:45.360 --> 00:23:45.370
whole app is redeemed similarly if you
 

00:23:45.370 --> 00:23:47.730
whole app is redeemed similarly if you
want a dark theme or a fake dark theme

00:23:47.730 --> 00:23:47.740
want a dark theme or a fake dark theme
 

00:23:47.740 --> 00:23:49.530
want a dark theme or a fake dark theme
of sorts all you have to do is change a

00:23:49.530 --> 00:23:49.540
of sorts all you have to do is change a
 

00:23:49.540 --> 00:23:50.910
of sorts all you have to do is change a
couple of these other color attributes

00:23:50.910 --> 00:23:50.920
couple of these other color attributes
 

00:23:50.920 --> 00:23:52.950
couple of these other color attributes
and the component should all respond

00:23:52.950 --> 00:23:52.960
and the component should all respond
 

00:23:52.960 --> 00:23:54.990
and the component should all respond
appropriately to that and you have a

00:23:54.990 --> 00:23:55.000
appropriately to that and you have a
 

00:23:55.000 --> 00:23:59.460
appropriately to that and you have a
different looking out now we're going to

00:23:59.460 --> 00:23:59.470
different looking out now we're going to
 

00:23:59.470 --> 00:24:00.960
different looking out now we're going to
talk a little bit about custom

00:24:00.960 --> 00:24:00.970
talk a little bit about custom
 

00:24:00.970 --> 00:24:02.970
talk a little bit about custom
components and how you can use styles

00:24:02.970 --> 00:24:02.980
components and how you can use styles
 

00:24:02.980 --> 00:24:04.920
components and how you can use styles
and some of your components that you've

00:24:04.920 --> 00:24:04.930
and some of your components that you've
 

00:24:04.930 --> 00:24:07.860
and some of your components that you've
created there's really nothing magical

00:24:07.860 --> 00:24:07.870
created there's really nothing magical
 

00:24:07.870 --> 00:24:09.750
created there's really nothing magical
about the way our components use theming

00:24:09.750 --> 00:24:09.760
about the way our components use theming
 

00:24:09.760 --> 00:24:12.840
about the way our components use theming
it's all just basic Android theming so

00:24:12.840 --> 00:24:12.850
it's all just basic Android theming so
 

00:24:12.850 --> 00:24:14.550
it's all just basic Android theming so
you can use it in your components as

00:24:14.550 --> 00:24:14.560
you can use it in your components as
 

00:24:14.560 --> 00:24:17.460
you can use it in your components as
well you just have to create a default

00:24:17.460 --> 00:24:17.470
well you just have to create a default
 

00:24:17.470 --> 00:24:20.160
well you just have to create a default
style past that default style attribute

00:24:20.160 --> 00:24:20.170
style past that default style attribute
 

00:24:20.170 --> 00:24:23.250
style past that default style attribute
into your constructor and use obtained

00:24:23.250 --> 00:24:23.260
into your constructor and use obtained
 

00:24:23.260 --> 00:24:24.810
into your constructor and use obtained
styled attributes so

00:24:24.810 --> 00:24:24.820
styled attributes so
 

00:24:24.820 --> 00:24:27.360
styled attributes so
let's go through that here we have a

00:24:27.360 --> 00:24:27.370
let's go through that here we have a
 

00:24:27.370 --> 00:24:30.270
let's go through that here we have a
definition of a theme and some

00:24:30.270 --> 00:24:30.280
definition of a theme and some
 

00:24:30.280 --> 00:24:33.780
definition of a theme and some
attributes here we're creating a default

00:24:33.780 --> 00:24:33.790
attributes here we're creating a default
 

00:24:33.790 --> 00:24:35.640
attributes here we're creating a default
style attribute and setting it in our

00:24:35.640 --> 00:24:35.650
style attribute and setting it in our
 

00:24:35.650 --> 00:24:37.800
style attribute and setting it in our
theme so we have this must my custom

00:24:37.800 --> 00:24:37.810
theme so we have this must my custom
 

00:24:37.810 --> 00:24:40.730
theme so we have this must my custom
view style and we're setting it to this

00:24:40.730 --> 00:24:40.740
view style and we're setting it to this
 

00:24:40.740 --> 00:24:43.290
view style and we're setting it to this
widget that my custom view style that

00:24:43.290 --> 00:24:43.300
widget that my custom view style that
 

00:24:43.300 --> 00:24:45.180
widget that my custom view style that
we've defined somewhere in our theme so

00:24:45.180 --> 00:24:45.190
we've defined somewhere in our theme so
 

00:24:45.190 --> 00:24:47.990
we've defined somewhere in our theme so
this will mean that any components that

00:24:47.990 --> 00:24:48.000
this will mean that any components that
 

00:24:48.000 --> 00:24:51.540
this will mean that any components that
use this my custom view or any of these

00:24:51.540 --> 00:24:51.550
use this my custom view or any of these
 

00:24:51.550 --> 00:24:53.670
use this my custom view or any of these
my custom views will use this style by

00:24:53.670 --> 00:24:53.680
my custom views will use this style by
 

00:24:53.680 --> 00:24:58.250
my custom views will use this style by
default you also can create a style Obul

00:24:58.250 --> 00:24:58.260
default you also can create a style Obul
 

00:24:58.260 --> 00:25:00.840
default you also can create a style Obul
which holds a few different attributes

00:25:00.840 --> 00:25:00.850
which holds a few different attributes
 

00:25:00.850 --> 00:25:05.130
which holds a few different attributes
and then you just need to use these in

00:25:05.130 --> 00:25:05.140
and then you just need to use these in
 

00:25:05.140 --> 00:25:06.870
and then you just need to use these in
the Constructors so here's an example of

00:25:06.870 --> 00:25:06.880
the Constructors so here's an example of
 

00:25:06.880 --> 00:25:10.680
the Constructors so here's an example of
a constructor for a view here we pass in

00:25:10.680 --> 00:25:10.690
a constructor for a view here we pass in
 

00:25:10.690 --> 00:25:12.150
a constructor for a view here we pass in
the default style which we created

00:25:12.150 --> 00:25:12.160
the default style which we created
 

00:25:12.160 --> 00:25:16.170
the default style which we created
previously and we pass this in here so

00:25:16.170 --> 00:25:16.180
previously and we pass this in here so
 

00:25:16.180 --> 00:25:18.660
previously and we pass this in here so
that it can pick up that default style

00:25:18.660 --> 00:25:18.670
that it can pick up that default style
 

00:25:18.670 --> 00:25:23.190
that it can pick up that default style
if nothing else is set and then we're

00:25:23.190 --> 00:25:23.200
if nothing else is set and then we're
 

00:25:23.200 --> 00:25:25.380
if nothing else is set and then we're
using obtain styled attributes and we

00:25:25.380 --> 00:25:25.390
using obtain styled attributes and we
 

00:25:25.390 --> 00:25:27.360
using obtain styled attributes and we
pass in the style that we just created

00:25:27.360 --> 00:25:27.370
pass in the style that we just created
 

00:25:27.370 --> 00:25:30.030
pass in the style that we just created
as well as the default style attribute

00:25:30.030 --> 00:25:30.040
as well as the default style attribute
 

00:25:30.040 --> 00:25:32.000
as well as the default style attribute
that was passed into the constructor and

00:25:32.000 --> 00:25:32.010
that was passed into the constructor and
 

00:25:32.010 --> 00:25:34.830
that was passed into the constructor and
finally a fallback style that can be

00:25:34.830 --> 00:25:34.840
finally a fallback style that can be
 

00:25:34.840 --> 00:25:36.570
finally a fallback style that can be
used as a last resort for finding

00:25:36.570 --> 00:25:36.580
used as a last resort for finding
 

00:25:36.580 --> 00:25:39.660
used as a last resort for finding
attributes and then just read those in

00:25:39.660 --> 00:25:39.670
attributes and then just read those in
 

00:25:39.670 --> 00:25:43.410
attributes and then just read those in
and that's basically how our components

00:25:43.410 --> 00:25:43.420
and that's basically how our components
 

00:25:43.420 --> 00:25:45.510
and that's basically how our components
work so you can definitely do it

00:25:45.510 --> 00:25:45.520
work so you can definitely do it
 

00:25:45.520 --> 00:25:48.960
work so you can definitely do it
yourself as well and also extend the

00:25:48.960 --> 00:25:48.970
yourself as well and also extend the
 

00:25:48.970 --> 00:25:50.970
yourself as well and also extend the
systems for your use cases right like if

00:25:50.970 --> 00:25:50.980
systems for your use cases right like if
 

00:25:50.980 --> 00:25:53.850
systems for your use cases right like if
you have the need for more attributes in

00:25:53.850 --> 00:25:53.860
you have the need for more attributes in
 

00:25:53.860 --> 00:25:57.300
you have the need for more attributes in
some case you can definitely add those

00:25:57.300 --> 00:25:57.310
some case you can definitely add those
 

00:25:57.310 --> 00:26:00.390
some case you can definitely add those
in it might be a little bit more work on

00:26:00.390 --> 00:26:00.400
in it might be a little bit more work on
 

00:26:00.400 --> 00:26:01.890
in it might be a little bit more work on
your part because you'll have to update

00:26:01.890 --> 00:26:01.900
your part because you'll have to update
 

00:26:01.900 --> 00:26:04.050
your part because you'll have to update
styles for all of the components that

00:26:04.050 --> 00:26:04.060
styles for all of the components that
 

00:26:04.060 --> 00:26:05.730
styles for all of the components that
are using to reference those attributes

00:26:05.730 --> 00:26:05.740
are using to reference those attributes
 

00:26:05.740 --> 00:26:07.860
are using to reference those attributes
since our components that we're writing

00:26:07.860 --> 00:26:07.870
