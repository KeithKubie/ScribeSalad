1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.190
We glossed over this very quickly in the beginning of this,

2
00:00:02.191 --> 00:00:05.790
but there was a dispute about cholesterol and a dispute about saturated fat

3
00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:10.620
NA Sears, you were saying that saturated fat,

4
00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:15.420
that there's recommendations to reduce saturated fat and reduce cholesterol.

5
00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:18.090
<v 1>A real quick overview, and I'm going to talk fast,</v>

6
00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:21.240
so it was plenty of time.

7
00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:25.710
It was felt so until the forties it was not common to have a heart attack.

8
00:00:25.711 --> 00:00:29.370
Heart attacks were described in 1916 not to say they didn't happen,

9
00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:34.400
but the first medical article that used the word myocardial infarction 1916 1940

10
00:00:34.831 --> 00:00:37.590
there were not many heart attacks seen in a modern American city.

11
00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:41.430
After world war II, we, our economy went up in the city of Mina,

12
00:00:41.580 --> 00:00:44.910
Minneapolis executives started suffering heart attacks.

13
00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:48.210
It was also Franklin Delano Roosevelt died of high blood pressure.

14
00:00:48.211 --> 00:00:50.400
A few years later, Eisenhower had a massive heart attack.

15
00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:51.960
That's when our government,

16
00:00:51.961 --> 00:00:55.860
national institutes of health started funneling major money into studies like

17
00:00:55.861 --> 00:01:00.000
the Framingham study or from Newton Framingham's a city outside of Boston,

18
00:01:00.001 --> 00:01:03.450
and they basically invaded this town in 1958 till today.

19
00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:06.060
So we're spending money. We're going to figure this crap out.

20
00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:09.120
The idea had come up. Heart disease wasn't just aging.

21
00:01:09.121 --> 00:01:12.120
Heart disease could be explained by what's called risk factors.

22
00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:13.380
Smoking might not,

23
00:01:13.410 --> 00:01:16.260
you can smoke and live to a hundred but it's going to increase your risk and

24
00:01:16.261 --> 00:01:20.310
then they got into blood pressure and cholesterol and a family history.

25
00:01:20.311 --> 00:01:24.210
They identified what we call risk factors. So until that point,

26
00:01:24.211 --> 00:01:26.520
diet was not considered a factor in the development.

27
00:01:26.521 --> 00:01:28.800
The number one killer of men and women I want to point out,

28
00:01:28.801 --> 00:01:33.240
and Chris puts this on his website, I do too during this interview,

29
00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:35.880
every 39 seconds in American dies of heart disease,

30
00:01:35.910 --> 00:01:39.150
every 39 second the most frequent cause of death.

31
00:01:39.151 --> 00:01:43.160
So there will be about 200 people perhaps that will die during this podcast and

32
00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:45.750
the number one killer and 80% of it's preventable.

33
00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:47.490
Chris is going to prevent some,

34
00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:51.000
I'm going to prevent some cause the biggest enemy out there, smoking and crap,

35
00:01:51.001 --> 00:01:55.470
diet, calorie rich and processed foods, crap, sad diet, standard American diet.

36
00:01:55.980 --> 00:02:00.980
It became apparent in the early 1950s diet might play a role in a notorious

37
00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:05.400
scientist and many others. His name, dr ancil keys, PhD,

38
00:02:05.401 --> 00:02:09.420
PhD at two of them suggested dietary fat might be a factor.

39
00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:14.130
It was a hypothesis. It's as early stage epidemiology doesn't prove anything.

40
00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:15.660
He went out and did studies.

41
00:02:15.661 --> 00:02:19.770
Other people went out and did studies and the idea transitioned actually he was

42
00:02:19.771 --> 00:02:22.290
criticized for saying dietary fat, the disease, the,

43
00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:24.120
the conversation transition.

44
00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:28.470
There's some good fats like Omega three fatty acids are essential.

45
00:02:28.471 --> 00:02:29.131
You have to have them.

46
00:02:29.131 --> 00:02:33.150
And then maybe polyunsaturated fats from plants are more helpful.

47
00:02:33.151 --> 00:02:37.920
But the focus went on saturated fat in food. We just make a chicken,

48
00:02:37.921 --> 00:02:41.970
red meat pizza. Those are the highest sources. And, um,

49
00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:46.080
subsequently an data accumulated that guidelines started to suggest we've got

50
00:02:46.081 --> 00:02:48.930
this huge problem with heart disease. We should limit saturated fat in the diet.

51
00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:53.880
It was never limit off that 35% of calories that's not in anybody's word,

52
00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:56.610
a low fat diet. Um,

53
00:02:56.670 --> 00:03:01.090
and that has now promulgated in 20 international statements.

54
00:03:01.091 --> 00:03:04.090
There is no opposite whether it's a world health organization,

55
00:03:04.091 --> 00:03:06.340
the American heart association, American college of cardiology,

56
00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:10.750
whether it's the Institute of Institute of medicine says eat as little saturated

57
00:03:10.751 --> 00:03:13.330
fat as possible. They couldn't be more clear and these are high brow.

58
00:03:13.570 --> 00:03:18.070
These are not associated with vegan movements or paleo movements or whatever.

59
00:03:18.071 --> 00:03:19.360
These are medical authorities.

60
00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:23.410
If there was half and half you'd say controversy 21 to 21 say the same thing.

61
00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:25.330
They might pick a different cutoff point,

62
00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:28.150
but we will enhance the health and cut down the number one killer,

63
00:03:28.151 --> 00:03:30.430
whether it's in Asia, whether it's Europe, whether it's Australia,

64
00:03:30.431 --> 00:03:32.380
whether it's in the United States.

65
00:03:32.381 --> 00:03:35.270
There's unanimity and why did they come to the

66
00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:40.090
basic science? Because there is basic science and let me tell you yet,

67
00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:43.660
when you eat foods rich in saturated fat, which is called meat, cheese,

68
00:03:43.661 --> 00:03:48.410
eggs and such receptors on your liver for cholesterol, I've got cholesterol,

69
00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:52.030
my blood, I'd like to get some of it out into the liver to be metabolized.

70
00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:55.180
I need a receptor. You eat saturated fats, receptors go down.

71
00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:56.710
Cholesterol has no place to go.

72
00:03:56.711 --> 00:03:59.050
Cholesterol stays in the blood bumps into your artery wall.

73
00:03:59.230 --> 00:04:02.290
I'm putting a stent in Yardi. That's the basic biochemistry.

74
00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:06.160
Then they had epidemiology studies. Flawed. Perfect. It doesn't matter.

75
00:04:06.161 --> 00:04:09.280
There was cells, man. Whoa, Whoa, Whoa, Whoa, Chris, Chris. Thank you very much.

76
00:04:09.610 --> 00:04:11.170
Then they did controlled trials.

77
00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:16.560
Three everybody just go read Clark 1997 395 it's called metabolic studies.

78
00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:21.010
Change the diet. See what happens. You add, say trait of fat.

79
00:04:21.011 --> 00:04:23.950
Cholesterol skyrockets on average, not in a single person.

80
00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:26.320
If I give you a steak, Chris's steak and me a steak,

81
00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:29.290
our cluster would rise differently. It would rise. It would rise differently.

82
00:04:29.291 --> 00:04:32.530
It's our microbiome. It's our genetics. It would rise.

83
00:04:32.531 --> 00:04:36.280
So if that's a problem in the studies when you average everything together.

84
00:04:36.281 --> 00:04:37.930
So they had that and then finally,

85
00:04:37.931 --> 00:04:41.080
finally they looked at populations that live over a hundred these are called the

86
00:04:41.081 --> 00:04:44.770
pillars of longevity. They don't eat foods rich and saturated fat.

87
00:04:44.771 --> 00:04:45.940
They have a little, they don't have a lot.

88
00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:48.250
They eat a lot of olive oil in Italy and Greece.

89
00:04:48.460 --> 00:04:51.940
They eat almost no dietary fat in Okinawa, Japan, and they live.

90
00:04:51.970 --> 00:04:56.230
They have the greatest longevity in the world in 1970 they eat almost no dietary

91
00:04:56.231 --> 00:05:00.820
fat. About six, 7%. Okay to gather. No,

92
00:05:00.830 --> 00:05:01.271
it's actually,

93
00:05:01.271 --> 00:05:06.271
that is the basis for a major push to say cut back on animal products.

94
00:05:06.850 --> 00:05:11.650
Cause that's largely with the exception of coconut and Palm, uh,

95
00:05:11.920 --> 00:05:13.180
know where saturated fat comes from.

96
00:05:13.181 --> 00:05:18.181
So the to negate that is to throw out every major health agency in the world

97
00:05:18.941 --> 00:05:21.700
that I don't believe Chris Kresser can do that. No disrespect.

98
00:05:21.880 --> 00:05:22.713
I don't think Chris [inaudible]

99
00:05:22.870 --> 00:05:26.860
<v 2>throw out a hundred years of clusteral risks. Let's back up a little bit here.</v>

100
00:05:27.040 --> 00:05:29.110
Yeah. So, um, first of all,

101
00:05:29.170 --> 00:05:33.760
every food that we consume has all of the fats in it, polyunsaturated,

102
00:05:34.690 --> 00:05:37.030
monounsaturated and saturated fat. And in fact,

103
00:05:37.031 --> 00:05:41.170
two tablespoons of olive oil has more saturated fat than a seven ounce pork

104
00:05:41.171 --> 00:05:46.060
chop. That's a little known fact. Um, the, the oily fish macro, you know,

105
00:05:46.061 --> 00:05:49.930
which all of these health agencies that Joel is talking about advises us to eat,

106
00:05:49.931 --> 00:05:54.640
has twice the total fat and one and a half times the saturated fat that we're of

107
00:05:54.641 --> 00:05:58.970
the meat that we're told to avoid. Um, does it make sense that nature, you know,

108
00:05:58.971 --> 00:06:02.090
would include the, that you can eat, uh, uh, you know,

109
00:06:02.091 --> 00:06:05.180
macro and the polyunsaturated fats in it are good for you,

110
00:06:05.181 --> 00:06:09.410
but the saturated fat in it is bad for you. That's kind of nonsensical.

111
00:06:09.470 --> 00:06:13.940
But you know, th let's talk a little bit more about the research. So,

112
00:06:15.020 --> 00:06:15.770
um,

113
00:06:15.770 --> 00:06:20.360
there never really was good evidence to suggest that dietary cholesterol and

114
00:06:20.361 --> 00:06:24.740
saturated fat are connected to heart disease. And, uh, Zoe [inaudible] who's,

115
00:06:25.010 --> 00:06:28.700
uh, has a PhD in nutritional researcher, she wrote her thesis,

116
00:06:28.701 --> 00:06:33.701
her PhD thesis on the evidence back in the 70s that led to the restrictions on,

117
00:06:36.800 --> 00:06:41.780
uh, saturated fat and cholesterol. And then she also reviewed the evidence.

118
00:06:42.290 --> 00:06:47.000
You're all the way up until 2016. And, and if, uh, I have the,

119
00:06:47.450 --> 00:06:51.110
uh, this information on my website, if you go kresser.com/rogan,

120
00:06:51.440 --> 00:06:55.500
you can find it. And what you'll find is there never was really good, uh,

121
00:06:55.530 --> 00:07:00.020
evidence to support the limitations on dye, on saturated fat and cholesterol.

122
00:07:00.380 --> 00:07:04.820
And people have started to look at this more recently. And, uh,

123
00:07:04.850 --> 00:07:05.601
for example,

124
00:07:05.601 --> 00:07:10.601
you have a meta analysis of observational studies including about 350,000

125
00:07:11.361 --> 00:07:16.190
participants recently that found no relationship between saturated fat intake

126
00:07:16.191 --> 00:07:17.870
and cardiovascular disease.

127
00:07:18.530 --> 00:07:22.250
You have an exhaustive review of studies,

128
00:07:22.251 --> 00:07:25.400
something like 25 randomized controlled trials,

129
00:07:25.970 --> 00:07:30.290
gold standard of clinical evidence and almost 40 observational studies involving

130
00:07:30.291 --> 00:07:34.850
650,000 participants. And I'll read you a quote from the conclusion.

131
00:07:35.360 --> 00:07:39.200
Current evidence does not clearly support cardiovascular guidelines that

132
00:07:39.201 --> 00:07:43.490
encourage high consumption of polyunsaturated fatty acids and low consumption of

133
00:07:43.491 --> 00:07:46.010
saturated fatty acids. Now look,

134
00:07:46.011 --> 00:07:49.730
one of my favorite quotes is the F the philosopher, Anatoly France.

135
00:07:49.760 --> 00:07:53.330
Even if 50 million people say a foolish thing, it's still a foolish thing.

136
00:07:54.230 --> 00:07:58.880
And the other thing to consider is that the history of science is really the

137
00:07:58.881 --> 00:08:03.050
history of most scientists being wrong about most things most of the time.

138
00:08:03.770 --> 00:08:07.730
And, uh, you know, in science we have to continually challenge our,

139
00:08:07.820 --> 00:08:10.430
our hypotheses and try to falsify them.

140
00:08:10.431 --> 00:08:12.710
And that's how the scientific process moves forward.

141
00:08:13.070 --> 00:08:16.040
And that's why in 2010 the U S, uh,

142
00:08:16.130 --> 00:08:19.940
federal government removed restrictions on total fat, whereas before,

143
00:08:19.941 --> 00:08:22.580
there was a restriction on total fat because they,

144
00:08:22.600 --> 00:08:27.260
they acknowledged that the research was showing that not all fat is the same and

145
00:08:27.290 --> 00:08:28.610
that, you know,

146
00:08:28.611 --> 00:08:32.690
we don't need to be restricting fat from avocados and things like that.

147
00:08:33.050 --> 00:08:36.830
And then in 2015, they removed the restriction on dietary cholesterol.

148
00:08:36.860 --> 00:08:41.090
Now they did that fairly quietly because how do you think it looks when people

149
00:08:41.091 --> 00:08:44.390
have been told to, you know, limit their fat and limit their cholesterol.

150
00:08:44.391 --> 00:08:47.780
And then the, the eight federal agency goes back on that,

151
00:08:47.990 --> 00:08:51.860
that recommendation after so many years of telling people to do that,

152
00:08:51.861 --> 00:08:56.160
people lose faith in the agencies that are, that are issuing these guidelines.

153
00:08:56.280 --> 00:08:59.080
You know, and don't take it from me. You know, I'm, I'm,

154
00:08:59.270 --> 00:09:02.910
I'm not expecting anyone to believe me. And that's why I've put all of the,

155
00:09:02.940 --> 00:09:07.620
the studies and the research supporting this at kresser.com/rogan.

156
00:09:08.130 --> 00:09:09.510
But how about Johnny nidus,

157
00:09:09.511 --> 00:09:13.140
who's one of the most renowned epidemiologists in the world?

158
00:09:13.141 --> 00:09:17.370
He's a professor of medicine at Stanford and he has wrote some written,

159
00:09:17.371 --> 00:09:21.210
some scathing critiques of nutritional research recently that had been published

160
00:09:21.211 --> 00:09:24.840
in JAMA and British medical journal. So here's a quote from one of them.

161
00:09:25.320 --> 00:09:29.310
Some nutrition scientists and much of the public often consider epidemiological

162
00:09:29.311 --> 00:09:33.360
associations of nutritional factors to represent causal effects that can inform

163
00:09:33.361 --> 00:09:36.150
public health policy and guidelines. However,

164
00:09:36.151 --> 00:09:40.470
the emerging picture of nutritional epidemiology is difficult to reconcile with

165
00:09:40.471 --> 00:09:42.240
good scientific principles.

166
00:09:42.570 --> 00:09:47.570
The field needs radical reform and he goes on to point out that meta analyses of

167
00:09:48.601 --> 00:09:51.840
observational studies have found that almost all foods are associated with a

168
00:09:51.841 --> 00:09:56.670
higher risk of death if you crunch the data in certain ways. So,

169
00:09:57.270 --> 00:09:59.460
uh, it's not enough to say that, that, you know,

170
00:09:59.640 --> 00:10:03.660
governments are recommending this or that we have to look at the science and

171
00:10:03.661 --> 00:10:05.460
what the science is saying. And as I said,

172
00:10:06.390 --> 00:10:10.560
two recent meta analysis covering over a million people are not showing a

173
00:10:10.561 --> 00:10:15.000
relationship between saturated fat and heart disease and they're not showing any

174
00:10:15.001 --> 00:10:18.660
benefit from replacing saturated fat with polyunsaturated fats.

175
00:10:18.780 --> 00:10:21.960
<v 1>So these organizations, Joel, that you were describing,</v>

176
00:10:21.961 --> 00:10:25.830
why do you think that they recommend, based on what Chris has just said,

177
00:10:25.831 --> 00:10:28.770
why do you think that they recommend reducing your saturated fat,

178
00:10:28.771 --> 00:10:32.160
reducing your cholesterol. Okay. Um, and thank you and you know,

179
00:10:32.161 --> 00:10:35.700
the importance here, which we are, you know, technical in the weeds,

180
00:10:35.701 --> 00:10:38.850
but I want to bring it back, this discussion is do you have a stroke,

181
00:10:38.851 --> 00:10:42.420
heart attack out of this function, lose a leg or do you not?

182
00:10:42.421 --> 00:10:46.650
Because at least one factor in development of these horrible medical problems

183
00:10:46.740 --> 00:10:47.790
that are 80% preventable,

184
00:10:47.820 --> 00:10:50.760
at least one of it is your nutrition and the continuity nutrition.

185
00:10:50.790 --> 00:10:53.190
I mean there's no doubt it's a single most important factor.

186
00:10:53.191 --> 00:10:54.660
It's never been the only fact. Okay.

187
00:10:54.661 --> 00:10:57.390
But [inaudible] organizations are saying this,

188
00:10:57.690 --> 00:11:00.720
he's saying the studies don't support that. Well, uh,

189
00:11:00.750 --> 00:11:03.780
I just agree that the science, and I want to be very specific.

190
00:11:03.780 --> 00:11:06.180
Let's talk about cholesterol. Let's talk about sensory fat.

191
00:11:06.181 --> 00:11:10.500
So stay with saturated fat cause there is differences there. They're both, uh,

192
00:11:10.510 --> 00:11:13.710
you know, contents of food, fatty contents of food,

193
00:11:13.711 --> 00:11:16.560
but they're chemically different. And the volume weight is very, very different.

194
00:11:17.490 --> 00:11:20.820
Um, cholesterol only comes from animals, saturated fat as animals and plants,

195
00:11:21.090 --> 00:11:25.320
uh, depending on the food source. So when this rise in heart attacks developed,

196
00:11:25.350 --> 00:11:28.710
research began 1948 and 1950, 1958.

197
00:11:28.920 --> 00:11:33.920
There were observations made that carefully done dietary logs suggested these

198
00:11:34.501 --> 00:11:35.610
were hypotheses.

199
00:11:35.820 --> 00:11:38.490
There might be a connection between what you eat and heart attacks.

200
00:11:38.491 --> 00:11:42.600
And then it's centered on, um, you know, is it foods high in protein,

201
00:11:42.601 --> 00:11:45.060
foods high in sugar, foods, high in fatty sources.

202
00:11:45.061 --> 00:11:49.260
Ultimately they got sophisticated food, Italian plant fat sources,

203
00:11:49.261 --> 00:11:52.920
foods high in animal fat sources. So by the late 1950s,

204
00:11:53.170 --> 00:11:58.170
there was a very strong consensus already that foods high in animal products

205
00:11:58.271 --> 00:12:00.700
with saturated fat. They go together. We're talking meat,

206
00:12:00.760 --> 00:12:05.050
egg and cheese may be a role. Why, let me give you a great example. In 1959,

207
00:12:05.230 --> 00:12:08.590
you grew up in Japan. You have a cholesterol of 120.

208
00:12:08.650 --> 00:12:10.180
You almost never see a heart attack.

209
00:12:10.540 --> 00:12:14.980
You move to Hawaii because there's migration. Your cholesterol rises to 180.

210
00:12:14.981 --> 00:12:17.770
Welcome to America. Your heart attack, risk triples.

211
00:12:17.890 --> 00:12:20.020
You move to this great city, Los Angeles,

212
00:12:20.170 --> 00:12:24.250
which was published in 1959 your cluster is now to 10 you have 10 times the

213
00:12:24.251 --> 00:12:26.650
heart attack risk that you had when you lived in Japan.

214
00:12:26.651 --> 00:12:29.590
Genetics don't change that quick. This was within one generation.

215
00:12:29.890 --> 00:12:33.610
They're called Nisei people that leave Japan to move to California, the Nisei,

216
00:12:33.820 --> 00:12:38.020
and there's the Nisei Hahn study that tracked these people. Now is it the air?

217
00:12:38.050 --> 00:12:41.620
Is it that they adopted other bad habits? Shirt could be,

218
00:12:41.890 --> 00:12:44.650
but within a very short time they had 10 times the risk of heart attack.

219
00:12:44.650 --> 00:12:47.350
So public research and dollars.

220
00:12:47.351 --> 00:12:50.640
This stuff matters correlated with animal fats and protein.

221
00:12:50.980 --> 00:12:54.250
Why isn't it correlated with sugar and refined carbohydrates?

222
00:12:54.251 --> 00:12:56.260
So carefully done studies say,

223
00:12:56.261 --> 00:13:00.970
and I think we all agree more so now because we're overweight and now we're more

224
00:13:00.971 --> 00:13:05.971
insulin resistant and added sugars in the diet are more important in 2018 than

225
00:13:06.041 --> 00:13:09.430
they were. I'm in the country was thin in 1960 they weren't good then.

226
00:13:09.431 --> 00:13:12.520
They aren't good now, but when you parse it out, multivariate analysis,

227
00:13:12.521 --> 00:13:16.630
there's a stronger relationship between the number one food and studies like

228
00:13:16.631 --> 00:13:19.540
this is usually butter more than red meat. It's actually butter.

229
00:13:19.690 --> 00:13:22.060
That's just an R value. It's called the statistic.

230
00:13:22.061 --> 00:13:25.480
I don't want to go so deep into statistics. It is somewhere there is sugar.

231
00:13:25.870 --> 00:13:27.070
I'll give you a classic study.

232
00:13:27.280 --> 00:13:30.400
If you could hold sugar the same and increase dietary saturated fat,

233
00:13:30.401 --> 00:13:32.740
heart disease, rockets, if you could hold saturated fat,

234
00:13:32.741 --> 00:13:35.920
the same increased sugar and these manipulations of coronary heart disease

235
00:13:35.921 --> 00:13:37.360
doesn't increase. Let's point something out.

236
00:13:37.390 --> 00:13:39.310
I've been inside a hearts 15,000 times.

237
00:13:39.311 --> 00:13:41.550
I've never scooped sugar out of a blocked artery.

238
00:13:41.560 --> 00:13:43.390
I scooped cholesterol out of blocked arteries.

239
00:13:43.570 --> 00:13:46.420
20% of every blockage in a heart is cholesterol.

240
00:13:46.720 --> 00:13:50.200
It's a fact that was discovered in 1910 it's never varied.

241
00:13:50.710 --> 00:13:53.980
Then we've fed animal. Let's pause for a second. Chris,

242
00:13:53.981 --> 00:13:54.970
you have something to say about that,

243
00:13:55.340 --> 00:13:58.960
so that doesn't mean that the cholesterol is there because people were eating

244
00:13:59.110 --> 00:14:00.760
it. Joel, you know that could be though.

245
00:14:01.790 --> 00:14:05.120
<v 2>Let me, let's say, let's look at the, what the research says again here.</v>

246
00:14:05.121 --> 00:14:08.420
So they've done controlled feeding studies where they fed people two to four

247
00:14:08.421 --> 00:14:09.254
eggs a day,

248
00:14:09.710 --> 00:14:14.710
and those show that in 75% of cases that has zero impact on blood cholesterol

249
00:14:14.841 --> 00:14:17.480
levels for the other 25% of people,

250
00:14:17.481 --> 00:14:20.090
they're termed hyper responders and in that group,

251
00:14:20.091 --> 00:14:24.440
dietary cholesterol or does modestly increase LDL cholesterol,

252
00:14:24.441 --> 00:14:28.040
but it also increases HDL cholesterol and it does not increase the risk of heart

253
00:14:28.041 --> 00:14:28.874
disease.

254
00:14:29.090 --> 00:14:34.090
This is why the guidelines were changed on dietary cholesterol is there is no

255
00:14:34.400 --> 00:14:39.170
evidence that the consuming dietary cholesterol increases the risk of blood

256
00:14:39.171 --> 00:14:41.630
cholesterol. Most people, and even when it does,

257
00:14:41.631 --> 00:14:44.240
there's no evidence that it increases the risk of a heart attack,

258
00:14:44.241 --> 00:14:48.770
which is again, why the dietary guidelines change for saturated fat.

259
00:14:49.100 --> 00:14:53.390
Again, most of the studies showed harm were short term studies.

260
00:14:53.420 --> 00:14:58.370
These longer term studies have shown that on average eating saturated fat does

261
00:14:58.371 --> 00:15:03.371
not increase the saturated fat levels in the blood and have all of the longterm

262
00:15:03.800 --> 00:15:06.110
studies that looked at this.

263
00:15:06.111 --> 00:15:11.111
Only one showed any association between saturated fat intake and uh,

264
00:15:11.660 --> 00:15:15.260
cholesterol levels in the blood. Then we have a meta analysis,

265
00:15:15.320 --> 00:15:16.850
lots of meta-analyses actually,

266
00:15:16.851 --> 00:15:21.851
but one of the best known meta-analyses was of 17 randomized controlled trials

267
00:15:23.931 --> 00:15:28.340
of low carb diets that were high in saturated fats and published in the journal

268
00:15:28.400 --> 00:15:32.390
of obesity reviews and they found that low carb diets neither increased nor

269
00:15:32.391 --> 00:15:34.040
decreased LDL cholesterol.

270
00:15:34.430 --> 00:15:38.030
But what they did find was that low carb diets are associated with decrease in

271
00:15:38.031 --> 00:15:41.090
body weight improvements in several cardiovascular risks,

272
00:15:41.120 --> 00:15:44.840
risk factors including triglycerides, fasting glucose, blood pressure,

273
00:15:44.960 --> 00:15:48.050
body mass index, abdominal circumference, plasma insulin,

274
00:15:48.051 --> 00:15:52.190
C reactive protein as well as an increase in HDL cholesterol.

275
00:15:52.580 --> 00:15:57.580
Now there have now been 10 meta analyses of randomized controlled trials looking

276
00:15:58.761 --> 00:16:00.680
at low carb diets for weight loss.

277
00:16:00.740 --> 00:16:04.100
All 10 showed that uh,

278
00:16:04.250 --> 00:16:08.450
the low carb diet either outperformed in most cases or was,

279
00:16:08.470 --> 00:16:11.420
was on the S at the same level as low fat diets.

280
00:16:11.870 --> 00:16:14.900
There have been several meta-analyses now you can see them all at

281
00:16:16.820 --> 00:16:19.190
kresser.co/rogan that have looked at um,

282
00:16:19.220 --> 00:16:23.600
low carb diets for diabetes and even cardiovascular risk markers.

283
00:16:23.870 --> 00:16:28.400
And all of these meta analyses have found that low carb diets are superior for

284
00:16:28.401 --> 00:16:32.150
glycaemic control, for reducing insulin, for reducing triglycerides,

285
00:16:32.510 --> 00:16:37.280
and have beneficial effects across the board without increasing cardiovascular

286
00:16:37.281 --> 00:16:40.850
risk markers. So we're now we're talking about randomized controlled trials,

287
00:16:40.851 --> 00:16:45.200
which is the best form of evidence that we have and we're not seeing any harm

288
00:16:45.410 --> 00:16:48.620
from increase, you know, increased consumption of saturated fat.

289
00:16:48.950 --> 00:16:52.730
<v 1>So is the problem that you're citing epidemiologist studies from the 1940s and</v>

290
00:16:52.731 --> 00:16:56.630
the 1950s I would definitely go.

291
00:16:56.631 --> 00:17:01.160
I think we need to PR to prefer randomized controlled trials over that kind of

292
00:17:01.161 --> 00:17:01.994
evidence for sure.

293
00:17:02.480 --> 00:17:05.990
Why do you continue to go back to these studies from the 1940 and 1950s

294
00:17:06.770 --> 00:17:08.930
beginning? Well the beginning,

295
00:17:08.931 --> 00:17:13.760
but Chris just took 14 topics and put them into one for meta analysis or as

296
00:17:13.761 --> 00:17:15.230
controls to low carb, low fat.

297
00:17:15.260 --> 00:17:18.640
I mean they're all different topics and I dunno how you put that all together.

298
00:17:18.830 --> 00:17:23.180
You need clarity and laser focus. So we were talking saturated fat.

299
00:17:23.570 --> 00:17:27.590
I mean, so hypothesis is generated saturated fat in the diet. Butter,

300
00:17:27.591 --> 00:17:29.270
eggs and cheese may be bad for heart disease,

301
00:17:29.330 --> 00:17:32.300
something killing Americans left to right in 1940 1950s.

302
00:17:32.480 --> 00:17:34.730
Let's go into countries with widely different diets.

303
00:17:34.880 --> 00:17:35.810
Let's see what they're eating.

304
00:17:35.811 --> 00:17:39.650
Let's actually take their friggin diet back to Minneapolis. Let's analyze it.

305
00:17:39.651 --> 00:17:42.140
So it's not guessing, not food frequency questionnaires.

306
00:17:42.410 --> 00:17:45.650
We're taking their meals back, the United States analyze them, but boom,

307
00:17:45.651 --> 00:17:49.290
there's a relationship between dietary saturated fat and your risk.

308
00:17:49.291 --> 00:17:51.720
50 year followup. There's no short term followup.

309
00:17:51.721 --> 00:17:56.721
The study I'm referring to has 50 or felt 1958 to now and um,

310
00:17:57.120 --> 00:18:01.140
that strongly suggested that dietary saturated fat and heart disease,

311
00:18:01.141 --> 00:18:04.800
that doesn't, that's not what's called the ultimate randomized clinical study,

312
00:18:04.801 --> 00:18:08.340
but it's one high quality second study done in China at the same time with,

313
00:18:08.610 --> 00:18:10.980
you know, years of followup. So these are right up to date.

314
00:18:10.981 --> 00:18:13.650
There's publications right now from studies starting at then,

315
00:18:13.800 --> 00:18:18.000
but the publications are now, but then you get the best kind of study. Okay.

316
00:18:18.001 --> 00:18:20.580
I'm still on saturated fat. I'm not talking any other topic.

317
00:18:20.581 --> 00:18:24.390
You put people in a metabolic ward at the national Institute of health,

318
00:18:24.420 --> 00:18:29.280
395 of these studies published in 1979 you change their diet.

319
00:18:29.310 --> 00:18:31.650
This is the ultimate careful experiment.

320
00:18:31.651 --> 00:18:34.920
It might be for four weeks or six weeks you up their saturated fat,

321
00:18:34.921 --> 00:18:38.010
their cholesterol rises, your sugars can be, we're all different.

322
00:18:38.190 --> 00:18:40.080
That change in cholesterol is consistent.

323
00:18:40.081 --> 00:18:43.470
You're going to go up 20% 20% 20% we start at different points.

324
00:18:43.690 --> 00:18:48.360
You have to track the change in cholesterol. Chris referred to, actually,

325
00:18:48.570 --> 00:18:51.240
can I go off on a tangent? It's really interesting.

326
00:18:51.570 --> 00:18:53.730
This will fascinate your listeners, but it's right on the topic.

327
00:18:54.240 --> 00:18:58.170
2008 this is published data. I don't bullshit on this.

328
00:18:58.350 --> 00:19:00.720
2008 Mexico city, the national,

329
00:19:00.810 --> 00:19:04.200
they international dairy council meet and they publish their notes,

330
00:19:04.201 --> 00:19:07.110
which is why we know this and they said we are losing the battle.

331
00:19:07.111 --> 00:19:10.770
People are eating less dairy around the world and we are losing sales.

332
00:19:11.010 --> 00:19:14.100
What we can do is influence researchers, influence expeditions,

333
00:19:14.550 --> 00:19:16.890
insistent speaker. Well, it's every,

334
00:19:16.980 --> 00:19:21.030
every dairy council in the world just happens to meet in Mexico city that year.

335
00:19:21.060 --> 00:19:23.790
Then they go meet in Portugal. Then they go meet in New York, whatever,

336
00:19:24.060 --> 00:19:28.770
2008 we're going to put dollars into changing research and influencing people.

337
00:19:29.130 --> 00:19:30.360
Doesn't mean it's all bad.

338
00:19:30.390 --> 00:19:33.750
They publish those notes that are global initiative for the next year.

339
00:19:33.990 --> 00:19:38.520
They looked for sympathetic researchers that would change public opinion and

340
00:19:38.521 --> 00:19:41.850
that was right before the milk mustache campaign. They find a guy,

341
00:19:41.851 --> 00:19:45.180
I actually respect now, but I'm going to beat him up a little. Dr Ronald Krauss,

342
00:19:45.181 --> 00:19:48.900
MD in Berkeley, California, right by him runs it a lipid center.

343
00:19:49.350 --> 00:19:52.230
He's had beef funding for 10 years. He's had dairy funding.

344
00:19:52.260 --> 00:19:54.630
All of a sudden he's speaking to dairy industries all over.

345
00:19:55.050 --> 00:19:59.130
In 2010 two years later he publishes, we call it a meta analysis.

346
00:19:59.131 --> 00:20:00.450
That's not new research,

347
00:20:00.480 --> 00:20:04.920
that's statistical playing with previous studies that can be fair,

348
00:20:04.921 --> 00:20:06.870
can be unfair, whatever, whatever it is.

349
00:20:06.871 --> 00:20:11.580
Their conclusion is they could not find and verify that saturated fat in the

350
00:20:11.581 --> 00:20:13.950
diet, butter, eggs, and cheese raises the risk of heart disease.

351
00:20:14.010 --> 00:20:17.640
They never said eat butter, eggs and cheese. They just couldn't verify it.

352
00:20:18.060 --> 00:20:20.790
What's amazing, it's an American journal of clinical nutrition.

353
00:20:20.820 --> 00:20:25.350
That same journal is a, is a editorial that destroys the study.

354
00:20:25.380 --> 00:20:27.570
This is 15 reasons. This is horrible.

355
00:20:28.470 --> 00:20:29.910
Epidemiology by guy named Jeremiah Stamler.

356
00:20:30.090 --> 00:20:33.990
I've never seen a medical journal destroy a piece that they accepted for

357
00:20:33.991 --> 00:20:37.500
publication. Okay? So everything's like stirred up.

358
00:20:37.530 --> 00:20:42.090
And 2014, a guy named Chowdry publishes a similar analysis.

359
00:20:42.420 --> 00:20:45.330
That is the reason that time magazine put on the cover.

360
00:20:45.331 --> 00:20:49.000
Butter is back because it not new research. It's a meta analysis.

361
00:20:49.001 --> 00:20:51.580
It's all following this Mexico city, uh,

362
00:20:51.610 --> 00:20:56.610
effort to fund dairy positive publications.

363
00:20:57.260 --> 00:21:01.900
A study so bad that both the journal required them to adjust and republish the

364
00:21:01.901 --> 00:21:04.660
data cause of mistakes. The Harvard school of public health said,

365
00:21:04.661 --> 00:21:09.190
take this thing away. Statistically, this is nonsense. Since those two times,

366
00:21:09.191 --> 00:21:12.670
and that's just the bottom line, we have had confusion in the public.

367
00:21:12.670 --> 00:21:16.660
We've got experts like Chris experts like me, experts like dr Mark Hyman,

368
00:21:16.960 --> 00:21:19.090
experts like Dr. Walter Willett on and on.

369
00:21:19.720 --> 00:21:23.470
There is a quote from the tobacco industry that our product is confusion.

370
00:21:23.560 --> 00:21:27.150
They didn't care about, you know, winning the battle when the public's confused,

371
00:21:27.220 --> 00:21:28.900
we're just going to keep on doing habits they have.

372
00:21:28.901 --> 00:21:31.990
And that is got to stop because now we're in the weeds with conspiracy theories

373
00:21:32.770 --> 00:21:33.603
to saturated fat.

374
00:21:34.240 --> 00:21:39.240
So that's when the pendulum of 1950 1960 1997,

375
00:21:39.461 --> 00:21:43.390
395 of the best done studies in the world. Say you eat more saturated fat,

376
00:21:43.420 --> 00:21:46.900
your cholesterol goes up, more saturated fat, corn, heart disease goes up.

377
00:21:47.200 --> 00:21:50.130
It was Clarissa, it'll clear. And the guidelines said,

378
00:21:50.170 --> 00:21:51.130
the guidelines still say it.

379
00:21:51.160 --> 00:21:56.160
The guidelines still say limits the same science from the 1950s and the 1940s is

380
00:21:58.091 --> 00:22:02.560
applicable today. If it's in retrospect valid. Hey,

381
00:22:02.561 --> 00:22:06.190
let's point out one minute. Yeah, absolutely. Do you think it is? Absolutely.

382
00:22:10.490 --> 00:22:10.610
We're

383
00:22:10.610 --> 00:22:15.400
<v 2>going back to observational studies done 50 60 years ago that suffer from all of</v>

384
00:22:15.401 --> 00:22:17.270
the problems that I mentioned and to begin with.

385
00:22:17.271 --> 00:22:20.870
And several more that we didn't have time to go into. Um,

386
00:22:20.900 --> 00:22:24.110
we have randomized controlled trials now and you know,

387
00:22:24.170 --> 00:22:28.340
observational studies were never meant to prove a hypothesis.

388
00:22:28.341 --> 00:22:30.380
They're meant to generate a hypothesis.

389
00:22:30.381 --> 00:22:35.180
And it's true that in some cases it's not possible to do a randomized controlled

390
00:22:35.181 --> 00:22:39.020
trial. Like with cigarette smoking, you'd have to have,

391
00:22:39.021 --> 00:22:42.860
the trial lasts for so long and you'd have to isolate people and award so they

392
00:22:42.861 --> 00:22:46.100
weren't exposed to air pollution and other factors that can affect the result.

393
00:22:46.101 --> 00:22:50.870
You can't do that. But in that case the risk was a thousand to 3000% higher.

394
00:22:50.871 --> 00:22:53.930
So their criteria called the Bradford Hill criteria,

395
00:22:53.931 --> 00:22:58.931
which you can use and apply to observational studies to assess the chance that

396
00:22:58.971 --> 00:23:01.790
there's a causal relationship. And in the case of smoking,

397
00:23:01.791 --> 00:23:05.540
which actually was when the Bradford Bradford Hill criteria were created,

398
00:23:06.020 --> 00:23:08.780
that really that meets many of those criteria.

399
00:23:08.900 --> 00:23:10.310
In the case of nutrition research,

400
00:23:10.760 --> 00:23:15.050
very seldom did they meet more than a couple of the Bradford Hill criteria.

401
00:23:15.470 --> 00:23:20.150
Now, observational research, in order to be valuable, it needs to be confirmed.

402
00:23:20.390 --> 00:23:24.200
You know, the results need to be replicated in a randomized controlled trial.

403
00:23:24.201 --> 00:23:25.820
That's how science is supposed to work.

404
00:23:26.270 --> 00:23:31.270
But there was one analysis that found that zero of 52 claims that were made in

405
00:23:32.271 --> 00:23:37.040
observational nutrition studies were replicated when they were tested later and

406
00:23:37.041 --> 00:23:41.330
in fact five were replicated in the opposite direction. In other words, they,

407
00:23:41.360 --> 00:23:43.910
when they did an experiment, they found the opposite result,

408
00:23:43.960 --> 00:23:45.980
what the observational suggested.

409
00:23:46.070 --> 00:23:50.480
So a good examples of this are observational studies originally suggested that

410
00:23:50.481 --> 00:23:52.940
beta carotene, an antioxidant,

411
00:23:53.330 --> 00:23:57.500
that people with the highest intake of beta care team had something like a 30%

412
00:23:57.501 --> 00:24:00.680
reduced risk of death, which is not really plausible anyways.

413
00:24:01.040 --> 00:24:04.730
But then when they started doing trials where they were giving people beta

414
00:24:04.731 --> 00:24:08.000
carotene supplements, not only did it not improve their lifespan,

415
00:24:08.030 --> 00:24:10.940
they got more cancer, it increased the risk of cancer.

416
00:24:11.270 --> 00:24:15.260
So this is why it's so important not to rely just on observational data and to

417
00:24:15.261 --> 00:24:19.400
do these experiments. Now going back to saturated fat. As I said,

418
00:24:19.401 --> 00:24:24.401
we've got a 2013 meta analysis of 20 randomized controlled trials that found

419
00:24:24.801 --> 00:24:25.461
that low carb,

420
00:24:25.461 --> 00:24:29.120
high protein diets lead to greater improvements in glycaemic control compared to

421
00:24:29.121 --> 00:24:33.410
low fat American heart association, American diabetic association diets.

422
00:24:33.830 --> 00:24:38.830
We've got a 2014 meta analysis of 10 randomized controlled trials that showed

423
00:24:38.931 --> 00:24:42.590
that low carb diets are more effective than high carb diets for patients with

424
00:24:42.591 --> 00:24:43.670
type two diabetes.

425
00:24:44.060 --> 00:24:48.230
And we've got another meta analysis of 25 randomized controlled trials just

426
00:24:48.231 --> 00:24:53.150
published in 2018 that found the same thing. So you know,

427
00:24:53.180 --> 00:24:56.270
science marches on, we learn more, we change,

428
00:24:56.271 --> 00:24:59.870
and now we've got randomized controlled trials that are replacing some of the

429
00:24:59.871 --> 00:25:03.410
observational evidence from the fifties and sixties and seventies which,

430
00:25:03.590 --> 00:25:06.740
which by the way, and dr hark homes paper,

431
00:25:06.741 --> 00:25:09.500
you'll see that that evidence was never strong to begin with.

432
00:25:09.950 --> 00:25:11.780
And this is what we should be looking at.
