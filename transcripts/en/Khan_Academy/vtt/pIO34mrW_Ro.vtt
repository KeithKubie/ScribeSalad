00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:02.203
- [Voiceover] So I'm going
to recursively define

00:00:02.203 --> 00:00:04.084
an arithmetic sequence.

00:00:04.084 --> 00:00:08.078
So we're going to say that
they ith term of the sequence

00:00:08.078 --> 00:00:12.095
is equal to the i minus oneth term

00:00:12.095 --> 00:00:16.487
of the sequence plus 11.

00:00:17.598 --> 00:00:21.218
So each term is going to be 11 more

00:00:21.218 --> 00:00:23.654
than the term before it.

00:00:23.654 --> 00:00:25.792
Now we have to establish a base case here,

00:00:25.792 --> 00:00:28.079
and so we're going to
say that the first term

00:00:28.079 --> 00:00:30.443
of our arithmetic sequence is going

00:00:30.443 --> 00:00:32.747
to be equal to four.

00:00:32.747 --> 00:00:34.627
So given this recursive definition

00:00:34.627 --> 00:00:37.413
of our arithmetic
sequence right over here,

00:00:37.413 --> 00:00:39.525
what I challenge you to do

00:00:39.525 --> 00:00:44.525
is to find the sum of the first 650 terms

00:00:45.992 --> 00:00:47.374
of the sequence.

00:00:47.374 --> 00:00:48.047
Let me write that down.

00:00:48.047 --> 00:00:53.047
Find the sum of first

00:00:54.269 --> 00:00:59.269
650 terms of the sequence,

00:00:59.618 --> 00:01:01.557
of this arithmetic sequence

00:01:01.557 --> 00:01:04.157
that we have just defined.

00:01:04.157 --> 00:01:05.516
And like always, pause the video

00:01:05.516 --> 00:01:07.896
and see if you can work that out.

00:01:07.896 --> 00:01:10.415
All right, so how can we think about this?

00:01:10.415 --> 00:01:13.269
Well, in many videos we give our intuition

00:01:13.269 --> 00:01:16.417
for the sum of an arithmetic sequence,

00:01:16.417 --> 00:01:19.622
and we came up with a formula

00:01:19.622 --> 00:01:22.988
for evaluating a sum of
an arithmetic sequence,

00:01:22.988 --> 00:01:24.880
which we call an arithmetic series,

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:28.955
and that sum of the first n terms

00:01:28.955 --> 00:01:31.080
is going to be the first term

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:33.320
plus the last term over two,

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:36.154
so really the average of
the first and last terms,

00:01:36.154 --> 00:01:38.729
times the number of terms we have.

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:42.700
And this is only the case
when it's an arithmetic series

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:44.476
where each term that we're adding

00:01:44.476 --> 00:01:46.926
is a fixed amount larger or less than

00:01:46.926 --> 00:01:49.934
the term before it, or that
we have a fixed difference.

00:01:49.934 --> 00:01:51.896
So what about this one right over here?

00:01:51.896 --> 00:01:54.415
What is the first and the last term

00:01:54.415 --> 00:01:55.611
going to be, and what is our n?

00:01:55.611 --> 00:01:58.609
Well we know that n is 650,

00:01:58.609 --> 00:02:01.104
we know that n is 650,

00:02:01.104 --> 00:02:02.160
and we know what the first term

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:02.706
is going to be.

00:02:02.706 --> 00:02:04.760
The first terms is going to be four.

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:07.690
We need to figure out
what the nth term is,

00:02:08.315 --> 00:02:11.119
or we need to figure out
what the 650th term is

00:02:11.119 --> 00:02:12.408
going to be.

00:02:12.408 --> 00:02:14.324
Let's think about this a little bit.

00:02:14.324 --> 00:02:17.006
So this is going to be,
if we're taking the sum,

00:02:17.006 --> 00:02:20.825
it's going to be four plus the next term,

00:02:20.825 --> 00:02:22.926
the second term,

00:02:22.926 --> 00:02:27.001
so if a sub two is going
to be a sub one plus 11.

00:02:27.001 --> 00:02:31.343
So it's going to be four
plus 11, which is 15.

00:02:31.343 --> 00:02:32.922
We're going to add 11,
which is going to get us

00:02:32.922 --> 00:02:37.286
to 26, and we're going to keep adding 11.

00:02:37.286 --> 00:02:40.363
Now how many times are we going to add 11?

00:02:40.363 --> 00:02:42.255
Well to get to the second term,

00:02:42.255 --> 00:02:44.554
we add 11 once.

00:02:44.554 --> 00:02:45.715
To get to the third term,

00:02:45.715 --> 00:02:48.431
we add 11 twice.

00:02:48.431 --> 00:02:53.272
So to get to the 650th term,

00:02:53.272 --> 00:02:57.869
so this is a sub 650,

00:02:57.869 --> 00:03:00.052
a sub 650,

00:03:00.052 --> 00:03:02.049
we're going to have to add 11,

00:03:02.049 --> 00:03:03.352
look, to get to the second term,

00:03:03.352 --> 00:03:04.859
we added 11 once,

00:03:04.859 --> 00:03:06.773
third term, add 11 twice.

00:03:06.773 --> 00:03:09.375
So to get to the 650th term,

00:03:09.375 --> 00:03:11.766
we are going to add 11,

00:03:11.766 --> 00:03:16.073
we are going to add 11
650 minus one times,

00:03:16.073 --> 00:03:18.314
or 649 times.

00:03:18.314 --> 00:03:19.753
Notice, to get to each term,

00:03:19.753 --> 00:03:20.694
to get to the first term,

00:03:20.694 --> 00:03:23.515
you added one minus one,

00:03:23.515 --> 00:03:25.070
you had an 11 one minus one times,

00:03:25.070 --> 00:03:26.974
you added 11 zero times.

00:03:26.974 --> 00:03:27.845
You started with the four,

00:03:27.845 --> 00:03:28.994
didn't add 11 at all.

00:03:28.994 --> 00:03:29.772
Then the second term,

00:03:29.772 --> 00:03:31.188
you added 11 once.

00:03:31.188 --> 00:03:33.033
Third term, you added 11 twice.

00:03:33.033 --> 00:03:34.880
Fourth term, you added 11 three times.

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:39.802
650th term, you added 11 649 times.

00:03:39.802 --> 00:03:42.102
And so if you add 11 649 times,

00:03:42.102 --> 00:03:43.180
what do you get?

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:48.180
So four plus 649 times 11

00:03:49.286 --> 00:03:50.227
is going to be equal to,

00:03:50.227 --> 00:03:52.282
I'll get my calculator out for this,

00:03:52.282 --> 00:03:55.521
so this is going to be equal to

00:03:55.521 --> 00:03:59.967
649 times 11 is equal to,

00:03:59.967 --> 00:04:04.967
now plus four is equal to 7,143,

00:04:05.319 --> 00:04:07.478
7,143.

00:04:07.478 --> 00:04:10.043
So that's the 650th term.

00:04:10.043 --> 00:04:15.043
7, 143.

00:04:15.476 --> 00:04:17.832
And so now we can just evaluate this.

00:04:17.832 --> 00:04:19.888
So I'll get the calculator out for that.

00:04:19.888 --> 00:04:23.324
So we have 7,143 plus four

00:04:23.324 --> 00:04:25.391
plus the first term

00:04:25.391 --> 00:04:28.432
plus four is equal to that.

00:04:28.432 --> 00:04:30.232
We're going to divide by two.

00:04:30.232 --> 00:04:35.232
So divide by two gets us 3,573.5.

00:04:35.641 --> 00:04:37.743
We're going to multiply that times 650.

00:04:37.743 --> 00:04:39.182
That's how many terms we have.

00:04:39.182 --> 00:04:42.560
Times 650 is equal to,

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:44.025
that's a pretty large number,

00:04:44.025 --> 00:04:49.025
is going to be equal to 2,322,775.

00:04:51.373 --> 00:04:55.576
2,322,775.

00:04:55.576 --> 00:04:57.179
I already forgot it.

00:04:57.179 --> 00:04:59.533
I have trouble remembering things

00:04:59.533 --> 00:05:00.810
when I take it off my screen.

00:05:00.810 --> 00:05:01.867
All right,

00:05:04.357 --> 00:05:09.357
2,322,775.

00:05:13.272 --> 00:05:14.468
I'm glad I had a calculator in hand

00:05:14.468 --> 00:05:15.873
for that one, but you could do it by hand.

00:05:15.873 --> 00:05:16.849
I always encourage you to do it.

00:05:16.849 --> 00:05:19.456
It never hurts to practice the arithmetic.
