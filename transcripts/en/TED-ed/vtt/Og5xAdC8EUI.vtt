00:00:06.513 --> 00:00:07.893
Across the whole planet,

00:00:07.893 --> 00:00:13.712
humans eat on average between
one and 2.7 kilograms of food a day.

00:00:13.712 --> 00:00:17.534
That's over 365 kilograms 
a year per person,

00:00:17.534 --> 00:00:23.072
and more than 28,800 kilograms
over the course of a lifetime.

00:00:23.072 --> 00:00:27.384
And every last scrap makes its way
through the digestive system.

00:00:27.384 --> 00:00:30.103
Comprised of ten organs 
covering nine meters,

00:00:30.103 --> 00:00:33.423
and containing 
over 20 specialized cell types,

00:00:33.423 --> 00:00:38.123
this is one of the most diverse
and complicated systems in the human body.

00:00:38.123 --> 00:00:42.693
Its parts continuously work in unison
to fulfill a singular task:

00:00:42.693 --> 00:00:45.393
transforming the raw materials
of your food

00:00:45.393 --> 00:00:48.914
into the nutrients and energy
that keep you alive.

00:00:48.914 --> 00:00:51.384
Spanning the entire length of your torso,

00:00:51.384 --> 00:00:54.705
the digestive system 
has four main components.

00:00:54.705 --> 00:00:57.594
First, there's the gastrointestinal tract,

00:00:57.594 --> 00:00:59.995
a twisting channel 
that transports your food

00:00:59.995 --> 00:01:05.625
and has an internal surface area
of between 30 and 40 square meters,

00:01:05.625 --> 00:01:08.589
enough to cover half a badminton court.

00:01:08.589 --> 00:01:09.977
Second, there's the pancreas,

00:01:09.977 --> 00:01:10.893
gallbladder,

00:01:10.893 --> 00:01:11.678
and liver,

00:01:11.678 --> 00:01:16.504
a trio of organs that break down food
using an array of special juices.

00:01:16.504 --> 00:01:18.472
Third, the body's enzymes,

00:01:18.472 --> 00:01:19.253
hormones,

00:01:19.253 --> 00:01:19.996
nerves,

00:01:19.996 --> 00:01:20.727
and blood

00:01:20.727 --> 00:01:23.203
all work together to break down food,

00:01:23.203 --> 00:01:25.093
modulate the digestive process,

00:01:25.093 --> 00:01:27.947
and deliver its final products.

00:01:27.947 --> 00:01:29.776
Finally, there's the mesentery,

00:01:29.776 --> 00:01:32.095
a large stretch of tissue that supports

00:01:32.095 --> 00:01:35.854
and positions all your digestive organs 
in the abdomen,

00:01:35.854 --> 00:01:37.833
enabling them to do their jobs.

00:01:37.833 --> 00:01:42.153
The digestive process begins
before food even hits your tongue.

00:01:42.153 --> 00:01:44.184
Anticipating a tasty morsel,

00:01:44.184 --> 00:01:47.644
glands in your mouth start 
to pump out saliva.

00:01:47.644 --> 00:01:52.134
We produce about 1.5 liters
of this liquid each day.

00:01:52.134 --> 00:01:53.575
Once inside your mouth,

00:01:53.575 --> 00:01:56.055
chewing combines with the sloshing saliva

00:01:56.055 --> 00:02:00.873
to turn food into a moist lump 
called the bolus.

00:02:00.873 --> 00:02:04.550
Enzymes present in the saliva
break down any starch.

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:06.225
Then, your food finds itself

00:02:06.225 --> 00:02:10.986
at the rim of a 25-centimeter-long tube 
called the esophagus,

00:02:10.986 --> 00:02:14.314
down which it must plunge 
to reach the stomach.

00:02:14.314 --> 00:02:16.726
Nerves in the surrounding 
esophageal tissue

00:02:16.726 --> 00:02:20.268
sense the bolus's presence 
and trigger peristalsis,

00:02:20.268 --> 00:02:23.155
a series of defined muscular contractions.

00:02:23.155 --> 00:02:25.905
That propels the food into the stomach,

00:02:25.905 --> 00:02:29.537
where it's left at the mercy
of the muscular stomach walls,

00:02:29.537 --> 00:02:32.886
which bound the bolus, 
breaking it into chunks.

00:02:32.886 --> 00:02:37.016
Hormones, secreted by cells in the lining,
trigger the release of acids

00:02:37.016 --> 00:02:39.936
and enzyme-rich juices 
from the stomach wall

00:02:39.936 --> 00:02:43.517
that start to dissolve the food
and break down its proteins.

00:02:43.517 --> 00:02:45.988
These hormones also alert the pancreas,

00:02:45.988 --> 00:02:46.695
liver,

00:02:46.695 --> 00:02:47.767
and gallbladder

00:02:47.767 --> 00:02:49.717
to produce digestive juices

00:02:49.717 --> 00:02:53.815
and transfer bile, a yellowish-green 
liquid that digests fat,

00:02:53.815 --> 00:02:56.427
in preparation for the next stage.

00:02:56.427 --> 00:02:58.450
After three hours inside the stomach,

00:02:58.450 --> 00:03:02.957
the once shapely bolus is now
a frothy liquid called chyme,

00:03:02.957 --> 00:03:05.714
and it's ready to move into
the small intestine.

00:03:05.714 --> 00:03:08.237
The liver sends bile 
to the gallbladder,

00:03:08.237 --> 00:03:14.169
which secretes it into the first portion of
the small intestine called the duodenum.

00:03:14.169 --> 00:03:17.778
Here, it dissolves the fats
floating in the slurry of chyme

00:03:17.778 --> 00:03:22.238
so they can be easily digested
by the pancreatic and intestinal juices

00:03:22.238 --> 00:03:24.467
that have leached onto the scene.

00:03:24.467 --> 00:03:29.528
These enzyme-rich juices break the fat
molecules down into fatty acids

00:03:29.528 --> 00:03:33.217
and glycerol for easier 
absorption into the body.

00:03:33.217 --> 00:03:35.889
The enzymes also carry out 
the final deconstruction

00:03:35.889 --> 00:03:38.559
of proteins into amino acids

00:03:38.559 --> 00:03:40.759
and carbohydrates into glucose.

00:03:40.759 --> 00:03:43.900
This happens in the 
small intestine's lower regions,

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:45.888
the jejunum and ileum,

00:03:45.888 --> 00:03:49.877
which are coated in millions 
of tiny projections called villi.

00:03:49.877 --> 00:03:54.410
These create a huge surface area
to maximize molecule absorption

00:03:54.410 --> 00:03:56.991
and transference into the blood stream.

00:03:56.991 --> 00:03:59.650
The blood takes them on the final
leg of their journey

00:03:59.650 --> 00:04:02.450
to feed the body's organs and tissues.

00:04:02.450 --> 00:04:04.331
But it's not over quite yet.

00:04:04.331 --> 00:04:05.669
Leftover fiber,

00:04:05.669 --> 00:04:06.401
water,

00:04:06.401 --> 00:04:09.300
and dead cells 
sloughed off during digestion

00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:13.390
make it into the large intestine,
also known as the colon.

00:04:13.390 --> 00:04:17.421
The body drains out most of the remaining
fluid through the intestinal wall.

00:04:17.421 --> 00:04:20.029
What's left is a soft mass called stool.

00:04:20.029 --> 00:04:24.031
The colon squeezes this byproduct
into a pouch called the rectum,

00:04:24.031 --> 00:04:26.200
where nerves sense it expanding

00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:29.193
and tell the body when 
it's time to expel the waste.

00:04:29.193 --> 00:04:32.041
The byproducts of digestion
exit through the anus

00:04:32.041 --> 00:04:33.470
and the food's long journey,

00:04:33.470 --> 00:04:36.521
typically lasting between 30 and 40 hours,

00:04:36.521 --> 00:04:38.190
is finally complete.
