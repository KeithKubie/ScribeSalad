00:00:01.230 --> 00:00:03.969
There's a wide world of Gradle
plugins out there created and

00:00:03.969 --> 00:00:07.420
maintained by Gradle, its partners,
and by developers around the world.

00:00:08.680 --> 00:00:11.840
To find documentation on plugins
included with Gradle by default,

00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:13.230
check out the Gradle User Guide.

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:16.970
Specifically, Chapter 21 on
the standard Gradle plugins.

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:19.410
There are three broad types of plugins.

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:23.180
Language plugins for compiling
languages like Java or [INAUDIBLE].

00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:26.530
Integration plugins for
creating different sorts of artifacts.

00:00:26.530 --> 00:00:28.260
And software development
plugins that make

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:29.700
the software development process easier.

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:34.017
To find plugins written
by third parties,

00:00:34.017 --> 00:00:37.420
check out the Gradle plugin
portal at plugins.gradle.org.

00:00:38.950 --> 00:00:39.740
Here you can search for

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:43.170
plugins that will help you automate
whatever it is you're working on.

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:45.740
Now since these plugins
are provided by third parties and

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:48.620
aren't bundled with Gradle, there
needs to be a way to distribute them.

00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:53.050
Just putting them under source
control leads to the same messes with

00:00:53.050 --> 00:00:55.320
libraries or any other artifact.

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:58.720
Fortunately, Gradle's dependency
management can be used for

00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:01.200
the dependencies required
by the build script itself.

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:04.860
If you click on any of
the available plugins.

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:07.950
You'll see a snippet for
using the plugin in your build.

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:11.570
The build script block means that this
configuration applies to the execution

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:13.240
of the build script itself and

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:17.510
not to the compilation or execution of
whatever project Gradle is building.

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:20.550
This block declares a maven
repository hosted by great deal and

00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:23.010
a dependency on this particular plugin.

00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:25.280
Also since this is
a quite common pattern.

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:27.370
There's a simpler way to
do the equivalent thing

00:01:27.370 --> 00:01:28.470
using the plugins block.
