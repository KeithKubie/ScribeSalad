00:00:03.350 --> 00:00:08.450
Superhero movies are jam packed with action,
explosions, fight sequences and characters

00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:13.129
you can’t take your eyes off of, so it is
understandable when you miss a hidden reference

00:00:13.129 --> 00:00:14.129
in a movie.

00:00:14.129 --> 00:00:17.990
Some times a hidden Easter egg isn’t found
out for months after the films release, which

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:20.030
make them even more exciting.

00:00:20.030 --> 00:00:24.770
Today we are going to look at some that you’ve
probably never seen but all of them you should

00:00:24.770 --> 00:00:28.530
know about if you are a true superhero movie
fan.

00:00:28.530 --> 00:00:32.960

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:40.960
Here is Screen Rant’s list of ten Easter
Eggs Hidden in Superhero Movies You Need to

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:58.309
See.

00:00:58.309 --> 00:01:00.129
Guardians of the Galaxy

00:01:00.129 --> 00:01:05.750
The cosmic entities created the infinity stones,
which are the driving force behind the MCU

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:06.750
films.

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:12.010
Thanos needs these stones to complete his
Infinity Gauntlet and complete his plans.

00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:16.869
Guardians of the Galaxy references the four
cosmic beings twice in their first film, once

00:01:16.869 --> 00:01:20.830
when Starlord steals the orb and then again
during the Collector’s scene when they show

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:22.250
the six stones.

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:26.689
These characters are very important to the
MCU and maybe they have something to do with

00:01:26.689 --> 00:01:28.570
the plot of Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2.

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:29.570
We’ll have to wait and see.

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:30.570
X-Men: Apocalypse

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:31.570
X-Men: Apocalypse is the conclusion of the
"First Class" trilogy, but it won’t be the

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:32.570
last X-Men movie obviously.

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:33.570
In the post credits scene a vial of Wolverine’s
blood is picked up and placed in a suitcase

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:34.570
labeled, "ESSEX CORP." True X-Men fans know
this briefcase belongs to Nathaniel Essex,

00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:35.570
also known as Mister Sinister.

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:36.570
He’s one of X-Men’s most dangerous enemies
and that’s why so many of us were hoping

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:37.570
to see him in Logan.

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:38.570
Even though we didn’t the director and studio
assures us Mister Sinister is coming in a

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:39.570
future film.

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:40.570
The Avengers

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:45.159
In the Thor number 274 comic cook released
in 1978 we get introduced to Odin’s ravens,

00:01:45.159 --> 00:01:49.899
Hugin and Munin and Disney’s MCU introduced
them in 2011’s Thor.

00:01:49.899 --> 00:01:53.750
These characters are important because Ordin
sends them out to his Nine Realms each day

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:55.150
to learn what is happening.

00:01:55.150 --> 00:01:57.679
In The Avengers Thor takes Loki from the S.H.I.E.L.D.

00:01:57.679 --> 00:02:00.719
quinjet and they have a heated conversation
on top of a mountain.

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:05.039
Odin must have been looking after his two
boys because Hugin and Munin fly right by

00:02:05.039 --> 00:02:06.039
them.

00:02:06.039 --> 00:02:08.229
Do you know the director’s name of the first
Thor movie?

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:11.890
Was it James Gunn, Peter Quill or Kenneth
Branagh.

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:16.300
Stick around until the end for the answer.

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:17.660
The Dark Knight

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:21.790
Heath Ledger may be the fan favorite character
of the Joker but he was definitely not the

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:24.420
first actor to dawn the infamous white makeup.

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:29.340
Cesar Romero first portrayed the Clown Prince
in the original 1966 series with Adam West

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:31.690
as Batman and Eartha Kitt as Catwoman.

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:35.540
Christopher Nolan saluted Romero with the
first scenes that the Joker appears, as the

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:37.530
Joker robs a bank look at the mask.

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:42.140
It’s a reference to the clown mask that
Romero wore in his first episode as the Joker

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:45.530
in "The Joker is Wild" from the Batman television
series.

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:46.530
Deadpool

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:51.820
When Deadpool causes accidents and numerous
deaths to get his hands on Ajax take a look

00:02:51.820 --> 00:02:53.150
at the road signs.

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:58.330
One says, “Parker Boulevard,” which is
a direct reference to Peter Parker and when

00:02:58.330 --> 00:03:03.130
Deadpool pops his head over the car crash
another sign reads, “Nicieza Street.”

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:06.640
That’s to reference Deadpool’s co-creater
Fabian Nicieza, despite’s Deadpools comedic

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:12.240
mockery or superhero films you can tell the
filmmakers really respect this genre and we

00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:13.740
love them for that.

00:03:13.740 --> 00:03:18.970
Here’s a question for you, True or False:
Wade Wilson’s childhood hero was Captain

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:19.970
America.

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:23.460
We’ll give you the answer at the end of
our video.

00:03:23.460 --> 00:03:25.670
Captain America: Civil War

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:30.320
When part of the Avengers team tries to stop
Brock Rumlow from stealing a biological weapon,

00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:31.760
the Falcoln releases a drone.

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:36.430
The drones name is Redwing, that’s a reference
to Falcon’s comic book character whose sidekick

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:38.780
was an actual bird with the name Redwing.

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:42.750
Check out the actor playing Brock Rumlow,
his name is Damon Poitier and he actually

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:44.760
showed up in another Marvel film.

00:03:44.760 --> 00:04:28.680
He played Thanos in The Avengers post credits
scene.

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:30.090
Suicide Squad

00:04:30.090 --> 00:04:34.230
The scene where the Joker lays down surrounded
by knifes and other weapons is a reference

00:04:34.230 --> 00:04:35.530
the Pink Floyd’s the wall.

00:04:35.530 --> 00:04:40.240
The director David Ayer even confirmed this
reference and you can easily see the similarities.

00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:42.050
Take a look at this shot a little closer.

00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:44.670
See the baby clothes up on the top right of
the shot?

00:04:44.670 --> 00:04:47.800
That is a connection to Harley’s dream that
shows up later in the film.

00:04:47.800 --> 00:05:28.100
We wonder how many other references the film
makes in all those deleted scenes.

00:05:28.100 --> 00:05:30.240
The Dark Night Rises

00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:33.889
During the football game where Bane makes
his speech after complimenting a boys voice

00:05:33.889 --> 00:05:37.900
we get a glimpse of a missing character in
the Christopher Nolan’s trilogy, Robin.

00:05:37.900 --> 00:05:41.650
Stop right there, the character of Blake played
by Joseph Gordon-Levitt doesn’t count as

00:05:41.650 --> 00:05:45.360
a Robin character just yet, hopefully in a
spin-off he does though.

00:05:45.360 --> 00:05:48.900
During the football game you can see fans
holding up a sign for the Gotham City Rogues

00:05:48.900 --> 00:05:51.580
football team but take a closer look at that
“R”.

00:05:51.580 --> 00:05:55.550
The “R” is a homage to the Robin logo
that we have seen in the past.

00:05:55.550 --> 00:05:59.290
Do you know how many live-action Batman incarnations
there has been?

00:05:59.290 --> 00:06:02.190
Five, Eight or Ten, the answer is coming up
shortly.

00:06:02.190 --> 00:06:03.740
Batman V Superman: Dawn of Justice

00:06:03.740 --> 00:06:04.740
Whether you are team Batman or team Superman
you will get a kick out of this Easter egg

00:06:04.740 --> 00:06:05.740
dropped in by writers Chris Terrio and David
S. Goyer.

00:06:05.740 --> 00:06:06.740
When police are sitting in their car, checkout
what the woman says over the intercom to the

00:06:06.740 --> 00:06:07.740
squad car.

00:06:07.740 --> 00:06:08.740
She said, “Delta Charlie Twenty-Seven”,
which stands for DC 27 a reference to detective

00:06:08.740 --> 00:06:09.740
comics number 27.

00:06:09.740 --> 00:06:10.740
That’s the comic that first introduced the
world to Batman.

00:06:10.740 --> 00:06:11.740
She also goes on to give an address.

00:06:11.740 --> 00:06:12.740
1939 stands for the year Batman debuted in
comic book number 27.

00:06:12.740 --> 00:06:13.740
Deadpool 2

00:06:13.740 --> 00:06:14.740
Deadpool 2 is a highly anticipated sequel
to the first film released in 2016, many fans

00:06:14.740 --> 00:06:18.340
were hoping for a Wolverine and Deadpool cross
over film but the chances are slim.

00:06:18.340 --> 00:06:19.910
Fingers crossed it does happen.

00:06:19.910 --> 00:06:23.770
In the first film, the Merc with a Mouth makes
an R-rated joke about Wolverine and how he

00:06:23.770 --> 00:06:28.660
helped him get his own film but in the trailer
for Deadpool 2 we see another Wolverine reference.

00:06:28.660 --> 00:06:33.140
When he runs into a phone booth, a la Superman
take a look at the movie playing in the background.

00:06:33.140 --> 00:06:37.270
It’s Logan and later on we see Logan’s
poster but also take a look at the name on

00:06:37.270 --> 00:06:38.700
the phone booth from earlier.

00:06:38.700 --> 00:06:42.880
The name is Nathan Summers, who you might
know as Cable.

00:06:42.880 --> 00:06:46.950
There you have it ten Easter Eggs Hidden in
Superhero Movies You Need to See.

The answer is true, Wade Wilson’s childhood
hero was Captain America.

00:06:55.360 --> 00:06:58.760

Batmen including Ben Affleck.
