00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:35.910 align:start position:0%
so what these guys did was they came up
 

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:38.480 align:start position:0%
so what these guys did was they came up
with<00:03:36.120><c> an</c><00:03:36.210><c> honor</c><00:03:36.360><c> fly</c><00:03:36.600><c> translator</c><00:03:37.220><c> they</c><00:03:38.220><c> hooked</c>

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:38.490 align:start position:0%
with an honor fly translator they hooked
 

00:03:38.490 --> 00:03:43.100 align:start position:0%
with an honor fly translator they hooked

00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:43.110 align:start position:0%
into cyanogenmod and they hooked up to
 

00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:46.700 align:start position:0%
into cyanogenmod and they hooked up to
google<00:03:43.320><c> translate</c><00:03:43.860><c> and</c><00:03:44.070><c> so</c><00:03:45.000><c> they</c><00:03:45.390><c> they</c><00:03:46.260><c> work</c>

00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:46.710 align:start position:0%
google translate and so they they work
 

00:03:46.710 --> 00:03:48.770 align:start position:0%

00:04:31.880 --> 00:04:31.890 align:start position:0%
it took them way too long to get started
 

00:04:31.890 --> 00:04:34.400 align:start position:0%
it took them way too long to get started
um<00:04:32.160><c> and</c><00:04:32.610><c> and</c><00:04:33.600><c> that's</c><00:04:33.750><c> something</c><00:04:33.990><c> we</c><00:04:34.140><c> took</c><00:04:34.260><c> the</c>

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:34.410 align:start position:0%
um and and that's something we took the

um and and that's something we took the

00:04:39.950 --> 00:04:39.960 align:start position:0%
codebase that's 25 gigs of source then
 

00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:41.390 align:start position:0%

you<00:04:40.110><c> have</c><00:04:40.260><c> another</c><00:04:40.290><c> 50</c><00:04:40.890><c> when</c><00:04:41.100><c> you're</c><00:04:41.220><c> building</c>

00:04:41.390 --> 00:04:41.400 align:start position:0%

just you know packages you just have to
 

00:04:46.590 --> 00:04:50.650 align:start position:0%
just you know packages you just have to

00:04:50.650 --> 00:04:50.660 align:start position:0%
look at and this it's a ton of code and
 

00:04:50.660 --> 00:04:53.719 align:start position:0%
look at and this it's a ton of code and
the<00:04:51.660><c> thing</c><00:04:51.840><c> is</c><00:04:51.870><c> this</c><00:04:52.169><c> the</c><00:04:53.160><c> barrier</c><00:04:53.520><c> of</c><00:04:53.640><c> entry</c>

the thing is this the barrier of entry
 

00:04:53.729 --> 00:04:55.659 align:start position:0%
the thing is this the barrier of entry
is<00:04:54.030><c> just</c><00:04:54.330><c> it</c><00:04:54.540><c> doesn't</c><00:04:54.840><c> have</c><00:04:55.080><c> to</c><00:04:55.229><c> be</c><00:04:55.260><c> that</c><00:04:55.380><c> high</c>

00:04:55.659 --> 00:04:55.669 align:start position:0%
is just it doesn't have to be that high
 

00:04:55.669 --> 00:05:00.020 align:start position:0%
is just it doesn't have to be that high

new version of Android came out we'd
 

00:08:18.670 --> 00:08:21.210 align:start position:0%
new version of Android came out we'd
have<00:08:18.820><c> to</c><00:08:18.910><c> go</c><00:08:19.030><c> and</c><00:08:19.440><c> pretty</c><00:08:20.440><c> much</c><00:08:20.530><c> replay</c><00:08:20.980><c> all</c>

the commits that created the service and
everything<00:08:23.710><c> that</c><00:08:23.860><c> came</c><00:08:24.100><c> on</c><00:08:24.250><c> top</c><00:08:24.400><c> of</c><00:08:24.580><c> it</c><00:08:24.670><c> just</c>

00:08:25.500 --> 00:08:25.510 align:start position:0%
everything that came on top of it just
 

00:08:25.510 --> 00:08:29.730 align:start position:0%
everything that came on top of it just
became<00:08:25.720><c> way</c><00:08:25.930><c> too</c><00:08:25.960><c> much</c><00:08:27.330><c> so</c><00:08:28.330><c> with</c><00:08:28.450><c> that</c><00:08:28.600><c> we</c><00:08:29.380><c> kind</c>

00:08:29.730 --> 00:08:29.740 align:start position:0%
became way too much so with that we kind
 

00:08:29.740 --> 00:08:31.470 align:start position:0%
became way too much so with that we kind
of<00:08:29.860><c> sat</c><00:08:30.040><c> down</c><00:08:30.250><c> and</c><00:08:30.580><c> said</c><00:08:30.700><c> how</c><00:08:31.150><c> do</c><00:08:31.210><c> we</c><00:08:31.360><c> get</c>

00:08:31.470 --> 00:08:31.480 align:start position:0%
of sat down and said how do we get
 

00:08:31.480 --> 00:08:33.420 align:start position:0%
of sat down and said how do we get
around<00:08:31.570><c> this</c><00:08:31.800><c> so</c><00:08:32.800><c> we</c><00:08:32.950><c> came</c><00:08:33.100><c> about</c><00:08:33.250><c> with</c><00:08:33.370><c> a</c>

00:08:33.420 --> 00:08:33.430 align:start position:0%
around this so we came about with a
 

00:08:33.430 --> 00:08:36.840 align:start position:0%
around this so we came about with a
Santa<00:08:33.760><c> mount</c><00:08:34.000><c> platform</c><00:08:35.280><c> so</c><00:08:36.280><c> it's</c><00:08:36.430><c> a</c><00:08:36.490><c> new</c><00:08:36.610><c> more</c>

00:08:36.840 --> 00:08:36.850 align:start position:0%
Santa mount platform so it's a new more
 

00:08:36.850 --> 00:08:38.640 align:start position:0%
Santa mount platform so it's a new more
approachable<00:08:37.150><c> infrastructure</c><00:08:37.900><c> and</c><00:08:38.110><c> the</c><00:08:38.140><c> way</c>

00:08:38.640 --> 00:08:38.650 align:start position:0%
approachable infrastructure and the way
 

00:08:38.650 --> 00:08:40.620 align:start position:0%
approachable infrastructure and the way
it<00:08:38.770><c> works</c><00:08:38.950><c> is</c><00:08:39.190><c> we</c><00:08:39.460><c> kind</c><00:08:39.640><c> of</c><00:08:39.670><c> duplicate</c><00:08:40.390><c> the</c>

00:08:40.620 --> 00:08:40.630 align:start position:0%
it works is we kind of duplicate the
 

00:08:40.630 --> 00:08:44.400 align:start position:0%
it works is we kind of duplicate the
android<00:08:41.140><c> framework</c><00:08:42.510><c> so</c><00:08:43.510><c> we</c><00:08:43.630><c> essentially</c><00:08:43.930><c> have</c>

00:08:44.400 --> 00:08:44.410 align:start position:0%
android framework so we essentially have
 

00:08:44.410 --> 00:08:46.590 align:start position:0%
android framework so we essentially have
three<00:08:45.340><c> components</c><00:08:45.880><c> here</c><00:08:45.970><c> the</c><00:08:46.180><c> platform</c>

00:08:46.590 --> 00:08:46.600 align:start position:0%
three components here the platform
 

00:08:46.600 --> 00:08:48.720 align:start position:0%

00:08:48.720 --> 00:08:48.730 align:start position:0%
library a secondary resource package and
 

00:08:48.730 --> 00:08:52.830 align:start position:0%

00:08:52.830 --> 00:08:52.840 align:start position:0%
then it's statically linked OBO sdk the
 

00:08:52.840 --> 00:08:55.410 align:start position:0%
then it's statically linked OBO sdk the

00:08:55.410 --> 00:08:55.420 align:start position:0%

00:08:55.420 --> 00:08:57.270 align:start position:0%

00:09:35.850 --> 00:09:35.860 align:start position:0%
without platform releases Oh yep but the
 

00:09:35.860 --> 00:09:37.920 align:start position:0%
without platform releases Oh yep but the

00:09:37.920 --> 00:09:37.930 align:start position:0%

00:09:42.510 --> 00:09:42.520 align:start position:0%
can just toss into your project these
 

00:09:42.520 --> 00:09:44.880 align:start position:0%
can just toss into your project these

00:11:57.299 --> 00:11:57.309 align:start position:0%
can hit our SDKs so I'm going to jump
 

00:11:57.309 --> 00:11:59.249 align:start position:0%
can hit our SDKs so I'm going to jump

00:11:59.249 --> 00:11:59.259 align:start position:0%
right into the code here of how to add a
 

00:11:59.259 --> 00:12:03.149 align:start position:0%
right into the code here of how to add a
custom<00:11:59.529><c> tile</c><00:12:00.720><c> so</c><00:12:01.720><c> this</c><00:12:02.259><c> works</c><00:12:02.529><c> very</c><00:12:02.739><c> similarly</c>

00:12:03.149 --> 00:12:03.159 align:start position:0%
custom tile so this works very similarly
 

00:12:03.159 --> 00:12:06.210 align:start position:0%
custom tile so this works very similarly
how<00:12:03.459><c> you</c><00:12:03.970><c> would</c><00:12:04.149><c> post</c><00:12:04.569><c> a</c><00:12:04.720><c> notification</c><00:12:05.220><c> so</c>

00:12:06.210 --> 00:12:06.220 align:start position:0%
how you would post a notification so
 

00:12:06.220 --> 00:12:07.559 align:start position:0%
how you would post a notification so
when<00:12:06.669><c> you</c><00:12:06.759><c> think</c><00:12:06.939><c> when</c><00:12:07.299><c> you</c><00:12:07.329><c> click</c><00:12:07.539><c> a</c>

00:12:07.559 --> 00:12:07.569 align:start position:0%
when you think when you click a
 

00:12:07.569 --> 00:12:09.419 align:start position:0%
when you think when you click a
notification<00:12:07.869><c> and</c><00:12:08.350><c> intent</c><00:12:08.709><c> gets</c><00:12:08.889><c> fired</c><00:12:09.100><c> and</c>

00:12:09.419 --> 00:12:09.429 align:start position:0%
notification and intent gets fired and
 

00:12:09.429 --> 00:12:11.639 align:start position:0%
notification and intent gets fired and
so<00:12:10.419><c> the</c><00:12:10.600><c> first</c><00:12:10.779><c> thing</c><00:12:10.809><c> we</c><00:12:10.989><c> do</c><00:12:11.139><c> is</c><00:12:11.169><c> we</c><00:12:11.470><c> need</c><00:12:11.589><c> a</c>

00:12:11.639 --> 00:12:11.649 align:start position:0%
so the first thing we do is we need a
 

00:12:11.649 --> 00:12:13.979 align:start position:0%
so the first thing we do is we need a
pending<00:12:12.039><c> intent</c><00:12:12.159><c> to</c><00:12:12.549><c> wrap</c><00:12:12.729><c> it</c><00:12:12.939><c> and</c><00:12:13.059><c> you</c><00:12:13.839><c> can</c>

00:12:13.979 --> 00:12:13.989 align:start position:0%
pending intent to wrap it and you can
 

00:12:13.989 --> 00:12:16.229 align:start position:0%
pending intent to wrap it and you can
