I said that you would want to be able

00:00:01.872 --> 00:00:03.900
to make a maintenance ticket that's something that you

00:00:03.900 --> 00:00:06.130
would be doing a lot I imagine. But you

00:00:06.130 --> 00:00:08.390
wouldn't add a band to a festival because that's

00:00:08.390 --> 00:00:11.860
not really possible. Bands get added to set times.

00:00:11.860 --> 00:00:14.030
This last one is debatable but I personally wouldn't

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:16.630
make this a publisher action since it isn't something

00:00:16.630 --> 00:00:19.013
I'd be doing very often but maybe you did.
