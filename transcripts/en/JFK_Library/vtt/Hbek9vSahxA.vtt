00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:02.610
- I think the most challenging
thing about the project

00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:04.840
was really telling
Harry Burn's story right

00:00:04.840 --> 00:00:07.160
because when you're dealing
with a historical subject

00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:10.700
they really deserve for you
to tell their story correctly.

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:12.780
And, Harry T. Burn's story
really stood out to me

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:15.070
because it showed the
power of a single vote

00:00:15.070 --> 00:00:17.110
to really effect a great deal of change.

00:00:17.110 --> 00:00:19.400
He wasn't sure how he was going to vote

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:21.990
and he received a letter
from his mom, Febb Burn,

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:24.080
telling him that he
should vote for suffrage

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:25.710
and be a good boy.

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:27.840
And, it was really important to influence

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:30.570
Harry Burn's decision because
he was trying to decide

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:31.800
whether he should go against

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:33.630
his constituents and party leaders.

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:35.080
And, getting that letter from his mom,

00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:37.650
who was college education
and civic-minded,

00:00:37.650 --> 00:00:39.870
who really deserved the vote a lot more

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:42.950
than many of the men who
actually had it in Tennessee,

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:44.530
that really reminded Harry T. Burn

00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:46.140
of the importance and the rightness

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:47.890
of the cause of women's suffrage.

00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:49.780
That really was, I think, decisive

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:52.560
in making him choose the right
and ratify the amendment.

00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:55.240
- When I learned that it was really

00:00:55.240 --> 00:01:00.120
a combination of both historical research,

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:03.280
political courage, and writing,

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:05.020
that's a confluence of things

00:01:05.020 --> 00:01:07.800
that Jeffrey absolutely loves and adores,

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:10.060
and I knew he would really like to do it.

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:12.050
- I think political courage is timeless

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:14.500
and it's needed even more today

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:17.470
because we're increasingly
polarized and politicized

00:01:17.470 --> 00:01:19.050
as a society and government.

00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:20.430
Courage is a choice.

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:22.850
It's not so much just a
character trait you have.

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:24.660
It's really a choice you make in a moment

00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:26.940
to do the right thing, even when people

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:28.990
are pressuring you to do the wrong thing.
