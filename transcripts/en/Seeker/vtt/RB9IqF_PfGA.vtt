00:00:00.199 --> 00:00:02.480
A while ago our team had this crazy idea.

00:00:02.480 --> 00:00:05.830
What if we could send a VR rig to the edge
space?

00:00:05.830 --> 00:00:06.830
Great idea, right?

00:00:06.830 --> 00:00:07.830
We thought so too.

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:09.140
Turns out though, it’s not that easy to
do.

00:00:09.140 --> 00:00:12.940
But we decided to try anyways.

00:00:12.940 --> 00:00:17.590
Hey space cadets, Trace here for DNews.

00:00:17.590 --> 00:00:21.901
Now with a project like this there are definitely
going to be some hurdles to overcome, and

00:00:21.901 --> 00:00:23.160
we had two big ones.

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:27.880
One, how do you launch something to the edge
of space and two, how can we record video

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:29.660
there in extreme environments?

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:33.080
Well, to launch something high into the atmosphere
we used a weather balloon.

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:37.240
These high altitude balloons can, like the
name suggests, go extremely high, and they

00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:41.060
have the ability to take a camera rig along
for the ride with some sort of stability.

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:45.980
Obviously I'd love to use a rocket, but they
don't trust me with rockets.

00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:48.870
Weather balloons aren't sexy, but they're
dead useful.

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:51.850
Launching a weather balloon to the heights
that we were hoping to reach involves a lot

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:53.730
of planning and experience…

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:56.110
something we don’t have in this area.

00:00:56.110 --> 00:01:01.861
So we flew over to Indiana to hook up with
Stratostar, an education-first weather balloon

00:01:01.861 --> 00:01:02.861
company.

00:01:02.861 --> 00:01:07.420
These guys are experts, and could help us
boldly go where we’ve never gone before:

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:09.270
the stratosphere.

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:13.020
Stratostar had launched many weather balloons
before; they know how to use complex tracking

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:16.899
systems, monitor weather patterns and of course,
coordinate with the government.

00:01:16.899 --> 00:01:21.259
Basically, we didn't want to try this at home
-- and you shouldn't either, by the way.

00:01:21.259 --> 00:01:27.729
“Everybody thinks about airplanes...what
happens if this thing hits a plane?

00:01:27.729 --> 00:01:35.539
The FAA put together guidelines on launching
these types of balloons...you got to meet

00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:40.060
all those different criteria and coordinate
with them and let them know what’s going

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:41.060
on.”

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:44.200
The morning of the flight we had to get up
before the sun, both for video recording reasons

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:46.899
and the fact that there was a storm coming
in.

00:01:46.899 --> 00:01:51.600
We drove out to a rural area, a place where
are better that our rig lands in an open field

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:53.399
and not on top of a skyscraper.

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:57.130
Once there, we got to work, filling the latex
balloon with enough helium to get it out of

00:01:57.130 --> 00:01:58.130
the troposphere.

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:01.619
I helped out where I could, but Stratostar's
guys definitely knew what they were doing.

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:04.999
Now, while the balloon is being inflated,
let's talk cameras.

00:02:04.999 --> 00:02:09.259
We only had 12 and a half pounds to work with,
so we used really small, 4K cameras.

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:12.890
You can't just strap them onto a balloon;
we had to build a rig.

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:18.470
“Not only did it have to film and have the
cameras and lenses at certain angles, it also

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:25.610
had to not weigh much and use materials that
are allowed by the FAA.

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:32.590
Not very dense materials and still have structural
integrity, that it can handle the turbulence

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:34.909
of the entire flight.

00:02:34.909 --> 00:02:41.211
We used a lot of high density foam, and created
a harness to go around the outside so all

00:02:41.211 --> 00:02:43.930
the forces go around the outside of it.

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:50.569
And secure the cameras in a unique fashion
so there's basically no way they can fall

00:02:50.569 --> 00:02:55.239
out, but we can still access the functions
of the camera and the SD cards and make sure

00:02:55.239 --> 00:02:56.239
it can all fly.”

00:02:56.239 --> 00:02:57.739
And that’s just the exterior.

00:02:57.739 --> 00:03:01.240
There were also problems inside the rig that
needed to be dealt with.

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:06.980
“One of the biggest challenges we had was
dealing with the heating of the cameras.

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:13.590
If we tried t--o film with the internal batteries
they’d overheat in minutes.”

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:15.760
This isn't like your high-end gaming PC.

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:18.819
We can't shove more fans in there to keep
everything cool.

00:03:18.819 --> 00:03:22.569
You might not realize it, but cameras, they
heat up when they're sucking all those electrons

00:03:22.569 --> 00:03:25.049
out of a battery for long periods of time.

00:03:25.049 --> 00:03:29.390
At sea level, they can get warm, but the air
moving around the camera keeps it cool enough

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:30.560
to keep working.

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:35.690
Unfortunately, the higher up you go, the less
air there is… no number of fans can make

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:36.690
up for that.

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:41.290
We solved the problem by using large external
batteries, which were tested in both a vacuum

00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:46.159
chamber and a refrigerator; because not only
is the pressure at high altitudes 10% of sea

00:03:46.159 --> 00:03:49.469
level, but temperatures drop well below free
zing.

00:03:49.469 --> 00:03:53.859
Together, we built a custom box that could
withstand the violent flight, yet still record

00:03:53.859 --> 00:03:55.639
as long as we thought was possible.

00:03:55.639 --> 00:03:56.739
The batteries were tested.

00:03:56.739 --> 00:03:58.109
The balloon was full of helium.

00:03:58.109 --> 00:04:00.150
The day was as clear as it was going to get.

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:01.780
The government gave us their blessing.

00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:05.280
So, now all there was to do was launch.

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:07.999
Stage one is successful, the balloon is off!

00:04:07.999 --> 00:04:12.420
Onboard is our four camera rig, plus tracking
equipment so we could follow it.

00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:15.110
Now, we just had to wait... and watch.

00:04:15.110 --> 00:04:19.870
Best case scenario was that the balloon tops
100,000 feet, recording the whole time before

00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:23.730
falling back to Earth in a convenient retrieval
location.

00:04:23.730 --> 00:04:28.670
Worst case scenario and probably more likely:
the balloon is blown into another state, and

00:04:28.670 --> 00:04:32.120
lands on top of a tree (they have a slingshot
in case that ever happens).

00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:34.190
Of course it could also land on private property.

00:04:34.190 --> 00:04:36.810
The landowner doesn’t have to give us permission
to go get it.

00:04:36.810 --> 00:04:40.160
The whole box could break scattering our equipment
across Indiana.

00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:42.120
The balloon could get caught in a lightning
storm.

00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:45.020
The GPS tracking device could fail and we
could never find it.

00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:48.510
Or, the cameras could die after 5 minutes,
and we wouldn't even know until we jumped

00:04:48.510 --> 00:04:50.890
through all those hoops to get it back.

00:04:50.890 --> 00:04:53.760
Luckily for us, it landed about 8 miles away
from where we started.

00:04:53.760 --> 00:04:57.040
In a nice flat bean field, with friendly owners
that let us grab it.

00:04:57.040 --> 00:05:00.780
So, stage two, the retrieval, went about as
well as it could have.

00:05:00.780 --> 00:05:02.870
But now the moment of truth.

00:05:02.870 --> 00:05:06.690
After months of planning, testing, and more
planning… did the batteries last long enough

00:05:06.690 --> 00:05:07.690
to get it all?

00:05:07.690 --> 00:05:11.320
Did all four cameras work the whole time to
ensure a full 360 experience?

00:05:11.320 --> 00:05:15.190
Did the lenses remain clear enough or fog
up with moisture?

00:05:15.190 --> 00:05:17.250
Did everything go wrong?

00:05:17.250 --> 00:05:30.330
We made it back to the Stratostar office,
and the team began going through 

00:05:30.330 --> 00:05:31.740
the footage.

00:05:31.740 --> 00:05:38.930
You can see the results of this crazy experiment
is over on the brand new Seeker VR channel...click

00:05:38.930 --> 00:05:41.590
to find out if our mission to the stratosphere
was a success.

00:05:41.590 --> 00:05:45.270
