00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.780
What's up guys?

00:00:00.780 --> 00:00:03.980
I'm hanging out again with my good friends Jake and Richie from the Sonic Dad crew.

00:00:03.980 --> 00:00:05.500
We're back in the Arizona desert

00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:07.720
because we asked you what kind of things you want to see us blast

00:00:07.720 --> 00:00:09.480
out of our sonic blaster cannon.

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:13.900
You came up with some pretty creative ideas so today we're taking those requests and putting them to the test.

00:00:13.960 --> 00:00:15.240
Lets dive right in!

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:18.380
Our first experiment today comes from Emilpre 03 who says

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:20.460
we should try shooting chunks of dry ice with it!

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:22.280
Well of course we should! Why wouldn't you?

00:00:22.280 --> 00:00:26.240
So I went down to the store and picked up 7 pounds of dry ice so we can load these cannons up

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:28.300
and see how dry ice reacts, if we shoot them at water bottles.

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:40.220
Alright, you guys ready?

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:43.720
Ready. 3. 2. 1. Fire!

00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:45.440
Woah! It actually worked!

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:49.040
Oh my goodness, that penetrated! Look at that, look at this, this is so cool!

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:56.800
Ok guys, seriously, I did not expect that to go through

00:00:56.800 --> 00:00:59.660
but the first time we actually hit it, it punctured the wall right there,

00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:01.540
and this thing is filling up with gas

00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:05.100
We got carbon dioxide venting out the top, we have the dry ice bubbling at the bottom

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:07.120
and all that gas coming out this hole.

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:09.560
That is cool!

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:12.260
I actually have a couple more water jugs, and we'll go get em', I'll be right back.

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:13.820
Ok, this is exiting!

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:20.240
In 3.

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:21.020
2.

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:21.780
1.

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:22.520
Fire!

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:24.640
Wow!

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:25.900
Its a geyser!

00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:29.860
That is amazing! You know, what happening is the carbon dioxide is creating pressure

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:33.220
and pushing the water out. That came out like, uh, a jet fountain there.

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:37.220
Look at how far that sprays!

00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:39.800
Its cool that, the spray came right at your lens (camera).

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:42.260
Nice job. Dry ice? Total win!

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:43.740
I'd do that again anytime.

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:49.700
Next up, we got Phantom Ender who says, can you put a pickle in it? LOL that would be cool.

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:52.260
Lets grab some pickles and get busy.

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:58.260
Oh, mine just kinda disintegrated.

00:01:58.260 --> 00:01:59.080
*Laughter*

00:01:59.320 --> 00:01:59.820
3

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:00.500
2

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:01.220
1

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:02.060
Fire!

00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:03.980
*Maniacal laughter*

00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:06.120
Nothing but pickle shrapnel.

00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:08.340
There's like chunks of pickle everywhere.

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:09.400
Lets do that again!

00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:13.080
I'll sell you my pickle for a nickel.

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:19.660
WOoOoOo!

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:23.480
You can see how pickle juice, and pickles sprayed everywhere.

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:25.480
None of that came out incact at all.

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:28.280
Even though I'm pretty sure we shoved out pickles in, like solid.

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:31.760
It's everywhere! It's all over the wall, it's all over the ground.

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:35.240
All it did was knock our jar over, which is pretty much expected but

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:38.280
Look at all this! Its shredded! We got shredded pickle.

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:40.000
You know what that is? That's relish.

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:43.820
It kinda puts me in the mood for a hot dog, which is coming up next! We got hot dogs!

00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:45.560
This one here is a good follow up to pickles.

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:48.360
We got David Forslund who says, go shoot some hot dogs!

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:50.240
So David, we're going to go shoot some hot dogs.

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:55.100
These are the biggest hot dog type things we could find. We need them big because we need them to fill the entire barrel.

00:02:59.820 --> 00:03:02.300
Look at that, Look at the way it peels.

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:05.400
This, is going to be interesting...

00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:06.240
3

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:07.000
2

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:07.680
1

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:10.660
*More maniacal laughter*

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:13.940
Oh, the spray radius on those hot dogs is amazing!

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:15.400
Looks like a nice shotgun effect.

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:17.700
Yummy!!!!

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:19.020
This is goopy.

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:20.280
A meat cannon

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:21.580
2

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:22.180
1

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:22.880
Fire!

00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:24.120
WOOoOoOOoO

00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:25.220
Oh wow!

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:28.240
HO HO HO HO. We got to see the slow-mo on that.

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:30.080
*Even more maniacal laughter*

00:03:32.020 --> 00:03:33.420
Wow!

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:35.860
Oh No!

00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:37.860
That looks like an incredible amount of power.

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:40.080
Who knew hot dogs could be that explosive?

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:40.860
*Intense thinking*

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:41.940
Before you eat them

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:47.040
Quick update guys. I broke my igniter and I can't get it to work so we're down to Richie and Jake, I'm out.

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:50.620
Next up, Prestyn Chapman wants us to try shooting play doh.

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:52.900
That's an interesting idea, lets go try it out.

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:05.960
In 3, 2, 1.

00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:09.100
Yeah!

00:04:11.300 --> 00:04:13.440
Woah!

00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:19.320
Okay so that was a total fail, but that is our play doh shrapnel everywhere.

00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:21.980
We got little bits down here. It's actually looking quite colorful.

00:04:21.980 --> 00:04:25.160
We got little remnants of pickle, hot dog, play doh, dry ice.

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:26.140
What is that?

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:27.860
That was pickle?

00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:28.860
Now I like this one.

00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:33.460
Kade Nelson says we should try shooting one of the darts from our previous blow dart gun project.

00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:36.500
That's a really great idea Kade, this time lets try making the darts even bigger.

00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:40.620
I got a party hat, I got a framing nail and a piece of chewing gum, we're going to put it all together

00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:42.040
and make ourselves a nail dart.

00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:49.220
That's one dangerous party!

00:04:57.760 --> 00:05:01.760
I'm pretty confident that you can hit this one blindfolded.

00:05:03.280 --> 00:05:05.640
OHHHH! Wow!

00:05:06.460 --> 00:05:08.440
Oh! He nailed it!

00:05:20.500 --> 00:05:22.180
Where did that even go in?

00:05:22.180 --> 00:05:24.480
I see, there's that, oh look at that.

00:05:25.300 --> 00:05:26.660
You nailed it. Jake!

00:05:27.720 --> 00:05:28.760
What an animal!

00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:31.300
Nailed it. First try!

00:05:33.760 --> 00:05:34.480
Here we go.

00:05:36.320 --> 00:05:37.120
WOoOoooOOo

00:05:39.200 --> 00:05:40.800
Yeah! That's what I'm talking about.

00:05:51.540 --> 00:05:57.780
Woo hoo! Look at that. You can actually still see, the nail dart inside the bottle, poking out the other side

00:06:01.940 --> 00:06:03.060
That's too cool.

00:06:03.060 --> 00:06:07.020
So nail darts will take on a bottle of coke, how will they do against a piece of wood?

00:06:08.820 --> 00:06:09.320
Ah!

00:06:09.860 --> 00:06:10.360
Wow.

00:06:11.340 --> 00:06:13.100
That was cool, lets go check the damage.

00:06:13.100 --> 00:06:14.960
Oh my goodness, look at that.

00:06:15.540 --> 00:06:19.480
Check this out guys, that nail dart went straight through the plywood, right up to the duct tape.

00:06:19.480 --> 00:06:21.620
Wow. You can see it penetrates straight through.

00:06:21.620 --> 00:06:23.640
Uh, that was fun, lets do that again.

00:06:23.740 --> 00:06:24.240
2

00:06:24.460 --> 00:06:24.960
1

00:06:26.120 --> 00:06:27.220
Woah!

00:06:27.660 --> 00:06:30.120
This way, you can build houses from across the street.

00:06:31.960 --> 00:06:33.720
Yeah. That packs a punch huh?

00:06:33.720 --> 00:06:36.040
Look at this guys, this is 1/2 inch pine.

00:06:36.040 --> 00:06:37.860
Penetrates, without problem.

00:06:38.280 --> 00:06:39.720
Not bad Jake! Not bad.

00:06:39.800 --> 00:06:42.420
Last up, we got the tootsie roll challenge.

00:06:42.420 --> 00:06:44.780
This is gonna be sweet. OHHHHHHHHH!

00:06:44.780 --> 00:06:49.580
Last experiment for today comes from Edward Leal who says we should try shooting candy.

00:06:49.580 --> 00:06:51.880
In particular, Tootsie roll slugs.

00:06:51.880 --> 00:06:54.520
What an epicly awesome idea, lets go give that a try!

00:06:56.380 --> 00:06:56.940
Awesome

00:06:59.000 --> 00:06:59.880
That is sweet.

00:07:01.040 --> 00:07:02.000
Tootsie slug.

00:07:02.460 --> 00:07:03.340
That's gross.

00:07:03.560 --> 00:07:05.100
*even more maniacal laughter*

00:07:05.620 --> 00:07:06.740
Fire in the hole!

00:07:08.480 --> 00:07:09.920
What, the heck?

00:07:10.220 --> 00:07:11.500
Are you serious?!?

00:07:11.500 --> 00:07:13.900
I thought for sure that it was going to stick to the board but it didn't

00:07:13.900 --> 00:07:16.500
It just like ricocheted and strands of Tootsie flew everywhere.

00:07:16.500 --> 00:07:18.040
Oh well, lets go make another batch.

00:07:18.040 --> 00:07:20.180
Alright, lets blast some of these rocks.

00:07:22.100 --> 00:07:23.780
Ha! Thats amazing.

00:07:23.780 --> 00:07:27.260
For how sticky and gummy that is, it's amazing that it doesn't stick.

00:07:27.260 --> 00:07:29.780
Look at that. Roll that around a little bit.

00:07:30.200 --> 00:07:33.900
Looks like maybe somebody had their dog or cat out here. Yeah Yummy.

00:07:33.900 --> 00:07:39.020
So for this last shot, why don't we use this thing like a plug, and we'll put all the Tootsie rolls still in their wrapper down the barrel

00:07:39.020 --> 00:07:40.100
and shoot it out like a shotgun.

00:07:44.840 --> 00:07:46.000
*more maniacal laughter*

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:48.020
That was a little worse than I thought.

00:07:48.020 --> 00:07:51.040
OOO. Look at this. We've got candy shrapnel everywhere.

00:07:51.040 --> 00:07:54.420
We've got candy wedged in the rocks. We've got candy buried in the ground.

00:07:54.420 --> 00:07:57.120
We got candy that ricocheted and flew every direction.

00:07:57.260 --> 00:07:59.100
Like over here, 6 feet away.

00:07:59.100 --> 00:08:03.420
Look, this one actually came right out of its wrapper, blasted straight out of its shell.

00:08:03.420 --> 00:08:06.160
So yeah, new way do distribute candy at your birthday parties guys.

00:08:06.800 --> 00:08:09.060
Well that was a ton of fun guys, thanks so much for your suggestions.

00:08:09.060 --> 00:08:13.600
