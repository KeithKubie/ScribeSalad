00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.940
But first of all, let's play a little bit more with the numbers.

00:00:02.940 --> 00:00:05.450
Let's say I make the following table here.

00:00:05.450 --> 00:00:11.860
This is the number of instances you need to solve--say 1, 100, 10,000 and this is

00:00:11.860 --> 00:00:18.400
the size of the instances, and this is the size of the instances, so smaller than 10, smaller than 20,

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:21.120
smaller than 30 or larger than 100.

00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:24.800
And now let's say you have algorithm that has running time 2^n.

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:31.090
We'll simplify this here, so as the running time is 2^n, no O off, no polynomial involved.

00:00:31.090 --> 00:00:33.540
All I want you to get here is a filling full of numbers.

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:37.950
Now, what I would like you to think about is in which case you see a brute force

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:39.580
would be something to try out.

00:00:39.580 --> 00:00:44.400
If you think that you should try brute force either you're sure about it

00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:47.480
or it's at least something to think about, then I would like you to make a check mark

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:52.220
in these boxes here and otherwise, leave the box blank, and of course, this is very subjective.

00:00:52.220 --> 99:59:59.000
