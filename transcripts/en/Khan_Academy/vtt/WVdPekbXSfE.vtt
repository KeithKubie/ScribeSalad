00:00:00.025 --> 00:00:01.305
What we're gonna do in this video

00:00:01.305 --> 00:00:05.485
is focus on key misunderstandings
that folks often have,

00:00:05.485 --> 00:00:07.779
and we actually got
these misunderstandings

00:00:07.779 --> 00:00:10.680
from the folks who write the AP exams,

00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:13.338
from the actual College Board.

00:00:13.338 --> 00:00:16.316
So let's say that we are trying to take

00:00:16.316 --> 00:00:19.470
the derivative of the expression.

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:21.125
So let's say we're taking the derivative

00:00:21.125 --> 00:00:23.066
of the expression,

00:00:23.066 --> 00:00:25.483
the natural log of sine of x.

00:00:29.409 --> 00:00:32.265
So the first key misconception
or misunderstanding

00:00:32.265 --> 00:00:34.285
that many people have

00:00:34.285 --> 00:00:35.283
is when you're dealing

00:00:35.283 --> 00:00:36.932
with transcendental functions like this,

00:00:36.932 --> 00:00:38.836
and transcendental functions
is just a fancy word

00:00:38.836 --> 00:00:40.810
for these functions like
trigonometric functions,

00:00:40.810 --> 00:00:42.040
logarithmic functions,

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:45.570
that don't use standard
algebraic operations.

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:47.613
But when you see transcendental
functions like this

00:00:47.613 --> 00:00:49.192
or compositions of them,

00:00:49.192 --> 00:00:53.000
many people confuse this with
the product of functions.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:54.718
So at first when they look at this,

00:00:54.718 --> 00:00:56.344
they might see this as being the same

00:00:56.344 --> 00:00:59.130
as the derivative with respect to x

00:00:59.130 --> 00:01:00.797
of natural log of x,

00:01:02.567 --> 00:01:05.400
natural log of x, times sine of x.

00:01:06.607 --> 00:01:08.511
And you can see just the
way that it's written,

00:01:08.511 --> 00:01:10.136
they look very similar,

00:01:10.136 --> 00:01:12.830
but this is the product of two functions.

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:16.847
If you said natural log of x is f of x,

00:01:16.847 --> 00:01:19.703
and sine of x is g of x,

00:01:19.703 --> 00:01:22.582
this is the product of sine and g of x,

00:01:22.582 --> 00:01:26.112
sorry this is the product
of f of x and g of x,

00:01:26.112 --> 00:01:29.037
and here you would use the product rule.

00:01:29.037 --> 00:01:31.104
So to actually compute this,

00:01:31.104 --> 00:01:35.330
you would use the
product, the product rule.

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:37.513
But this is a composition.

00:01:37.513 --> 00:01:39.974
Here you have f of g of x,

00:01:39.974 --> 00:01:42.224
not f of x times g of x.

00:01:43.503 --> 00:01:44.836
So here you have

00:01:46.731 --> 00:01:49.541
that is our g of x, it equals sine of x,

00:01:49.541 --> 00:01:52.072
and then our f of g of x

00:01:52.072 --> 00:01:54.138
is the natural log of sine of x.

00:01:54.138 --> 00:01:56.055
So this is f of g of x,

00:01:58.387 --> 00:02:00.663
f of g of x just like that.

00:02:00.663 --> 00:02:02.497
If someone asks you just what f of x was,

00:02:02.497 --> 00:02:03.983
well that would be natural log of x,

00:02:03.983 --> 00:02:07.675
but f of g of x is
natural log of our g of x,

00:02:07.675 --> 00:02:09.974
which is natural log of sine of x.

00:02:09.974 --> 00:02:11.623
So that's the key first thing,

00:02:11.623 --> 00:02:14.293
always make sure whether you're gonna use,

00:02:14.293 --> 00:02:16.522
especially with these
transcendental functions,

00:02:16.522 --> 00:02:18.798
that hey if this is a
composition you've gotta use

00:02:18.798 --> 00:02:20.980
the chain rule, not the product rule.

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:22.234
It's not the product.

00:02:22.234 --> 00:02:23.628
Now sometimes you have a combination,

00:02:23.628 --> 00:02:24.789
you have a product of compositions,

00:02:24.789 --> 00:02:26.809
and then things get a
little bit more involved.

00:02:26.809 --> 00:02:29.061
But pay close attention to make sure

00:02:29.061 --> 00:02:33.310
that you're not dealing
with a composition.

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:36.190
Now the next misconception students have

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:37.513
is even if they recognize,

00:02:37.513 --> 00:02:38.837
okay I've gotta use the chain rule,

00:02:38.837 --> 00:02:42.204
sometimes it doesn't
go fully to completion.

00:02:42.204 --> 00:02:44.526
So let's continue using this example.

00:02:44.526 --> 00:02:45.988
The chain rule here says,

00:02:45.988 --> 00:02:49.007
look we have to take the
derivative of the outer function

00:02:49.007 --> 00:02:51.817
with respect to the inner function.

00:02:51.817 --> 00:02:53.140
So if I were to say,

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:56.182
in this case, f of x is natural log of x,

00:02:56.182 --> 00:02:58.550
f of g of x is this expression here.

00:02:58.550 --> 00:03:00.617
So if I wanna do this first part,

00:03:00.617 --> 00:03:02.117
f prime of g of x,

00:03:05.423 --> 00:03:07.304
f prime of g of x,

00:03:07.304 --> 00:03:10.602
well the derivative of
the natural log of x

00:03:10.602 --> 00:03:11.769
is one over x.

00:03:13.458 --> 00:03:16.894
So the natural log,
derivative of natural log of x

00:03:16.894 --> 00:03:18.705
is one over x,

00:03:18.705 --> 00:03:21.027
but we don't want the
derivative where the input is x.

00:03:21.027 --> 00:03:23.721
We want the derivative
when the input is g of x.

00:03:23.721 --> 00:03:25.811
So instead of it being one over x,

00:03:25.811 --> 00:03:28.876
it's gonna be one over g of x.

00:03:28.876 --> 00:03:30.209
One over g of x,

00:03:31.198 --> 00:03:34.634
and we know that g of x
is equal to sine of x.

00:03:34.634 --> 00:03:36.801
That's equal to sine of x.

00:03:38.419 --> 00:03:40.416
Now one key misunderstanding
that the folks

00:03:40.416 --> 00:03:41.972
of the College Board told us about

00:03:41.972 --> 00:03:44.781
is many students stop right there.

00:03:44.781 --> 00:03:46.407
They just do this first part,

00:03:46.407 --> 00:03:49.379
and then they forget to
multiply this second part.

00:03:49.379 --> 00:03:51.562
So here we are not done.

00:03:51.562 --> 00:03:55.021
We need to take this and
multiply it times g prime of x.

00:03:55.021 --> 00:03:56.322
And let me write this down.

00:03:56.322 --> 00:03:58.760
g prime of x, what would that be?

00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:02.684
Well the derivative of sine
of x with respect to x,

00:04:02.684 --> 00:04:05.285
well that's just going to be cosine of x,

00:04:05.285 --> 00:04:06.285
cosine of x.

00:04:08.768 --> 00:04:11.113
So in this example right over here,

00:04:11.113 --> 00:04:13.829
the derivative is going to be,

00:04:13.829 --> 00:04:15.687
let's see if I can
squeeze it in over here,

00:04:15.687 --> 00:04:18.218
it's going to be one over
sine of x which is this part,

00:04:18.218 --> 00:04:19.718
times cosine of x.

00:04:20.703 --> 00:04:22.235
So let me write it down.

00:04:22.235 --> 00:04:25.318
It is going to be one over sine of x,

00:04:26.624 --> 00:04:28.574
we'll do that in that other color,

00:04:28.574 --> 00:04:30.157
one over sine of x,

00:04:32.196 --> 00:04:34.936
and then times cosine of x.

00:04:34.936 --> 00:04:35.958
So once again,

00:04:35.958 --> 00:04:37.560
just to make sure that you don't fall into

00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:39.604
one of these misconceptions.

00:04:39.604 --> 00:04:42.320
Let me box this off so it's a little bit,

00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:45.037
it's a little bit cleaner.

00:04:45.037 --> 00:04:46.570
So to just make sure that you don't fall

00:04:46.570 --> 00:04:49.333
into one of these misconceptions here,

00:04:49.333 --> 00:04:51.515
recognize the composition,

00:04:51.515 --> 00:04:53.837
that this is not the
product of natural log of x

00:04:53.837 --> 00:04:54.836
and sine of x.

00:04:54.836 --> 00:04:56.694
It's natural log of sine of x.

00:04:56.694 --> 00:04:59.178
And then when you're actually
applying the chain rule,

00:04:59.178 --> 00:05:01.477
derivative of the outside
with respect to the inside,

00:05:01.477 --> 00:05:03.868
so the derivative of natural
log of x is one over x,

00:05:03.868 --> 00:05:06.678
so that applied when the input is g of x

00:05:06.678 --> 00:05:09.023
is one over sine of x.

00:05:09.023 --> 00:05:11.043
And then multiply that
times the derivative

00:05:11.043 --> 00:05:13.273
of the inner function.

00:05:13.273 --> 00:05:16.314
So don't forget to do
this right over here.

00:05:16.314 --> 00:05:19.078
Now another misconception
that students have,

00:05:19.078 --> 00:05:21.934
is instead of doing what we just did,

00:05:21.934 --> 00:05:23.629
instead of applying the
chain rule like this,

00:05:23.629 --> 00:05:26.787
they take the derivative
of the outer function

00:05:26.787 --> 00:05:29.712
with respect to the derivative
of the inner function.

00:05:29.712 --> 00:05:31.663
So for example,

00:05:31.663 --> 00:05:33.799
they would compute this,

00:05:33.799 --> 00:05:35.799
f prime of g prime of x,

00:05:38.606 --> 00:05:40.606
f prime of g prime of x.

00:05:41.856 --> 00:05:46.570
Which in this case, f
prime of x is one over x,

00:05:46.570 --> 00:05:48.288
but if the input is g prime of x,

00:05:48.288 --> 00:05:50.726
g prime of x is cosine of x.

00:05:50.726 --> 00:05:53.118
So many students end up doing this

00:05:53.118 --> 00:05:56.787
where they take the
derivative of the outside,

00:05:56.787 --> 00:06:00.386
and they apply the input into that,

00:06:00.386 --> 00:06:03.103
they use the derivative
of the inside function.

00:06:03.103 --> 00:06:04.603
This is not right.

00:06:06.353 --> 00:06:08.002
Be very careful that
you're not doing that.

00:06:08.002 --> 00:06:09.581
You do the derivative
of the outside function

00:06:09.581 --> 00:06:11.392
with respect to the inside function,

00:06:11.392 --> 00:06:12.762
not taking it's derivative,

00:06:12.762 --> 00:06:14.898
and then multiply, don't
forget to multiply,

00:06:14.898 --> 00:06:18.981
times the derivative of
the inside function here.

00:06:19.891 --> 00:06:21.470
So hopefully that helps a little bit.

00:06:21.470 --> 00:06:23.443
If all of this looks
completely foreign to you,

00:06:23.443 --> 00:06:25.115
I encourage you to watch the whole series

00:06:25.115 --> 00:06:27.066
of chain rule introductory videos

00:06:27.066 --> 00:06:28.552
and worked examples we have.

00:06:28.552 --> 00:06:30.897
This is just a topping on top of that

00:06:30.897 --> 00:06:33.010
to make sure that you don't
fall into these misconceptions

00:06:33.010 --> 00:06:35.146
of applying the product rule

00:06:35.146 --> 00:06:36.980
when you really need to
be applying the chain rule

00:06:36.980 --> 00:06:39.419
or forgetting to do
part of the chain rule,

00:06:39.419 --> 00:06:41.392
multiplying by g prime of x,

00:06:41.392 --> 00:06:44.559
or evaluating f prime of g prime of x.

00:06:45.456 --> 00:06:47.456
So hopefully that helps.
