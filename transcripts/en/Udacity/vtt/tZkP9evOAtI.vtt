00:00:01.790 --> 00:00:03.400
&gt;&gt; Hey, Kristian, you caught it.

00:00:03.400 --> 00:00:05.140
&gt;&gt; I did.

00:00:05.140 --> 00:00:07.600
&gt;&gt; How come, how, what made it possible to catch?

00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:10.135
&gt;&gt; Well, it was light enough. It was grip-able.

00:00:10.135 --> 00:00:10.220
&gt;&gt; Yea.

00:00:10.220 --> 00:00:11.380
&gt;&gt; It's about the right size.

00:00:11.380 --> 00:00:18.380
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm. So, we call those features affordances.

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:21.040
It's about the right size, you can flip it

00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:23.750
around, you can throw it and catch it,

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:27.160
and, you know, you can even hide behind it,

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:29.360
because it doesn't afford the transmission

00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:32.229
of light. So, affordance is very important.

00:00:32.229 --> 00:00:37.030
&gt;&gt; Wow. Thank you. Hey, there's something inside.

00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:37.670
&gt;&gt; How do you know?

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:41.250
&gt;&gt; Well, I heard something inside when I shook it.

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:42.160
&gt;&gt; And that means.

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:47.330
&gt;&gt; That I have a model that, that there's object.

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:49.600
&gt;&gt; We call those conceptual models.

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:53.300
&gt;&gt; Oh, is it a gift?

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:58.000
&gt;&gt; Open it. What are you looking for?

00:00:58.000 --> 00:00:59.540
&gt;&gt; I'm looking for something that tells me I

00:00:59.540 --> 00:01:02.280
can open it. [NOISE] because this lid doesn't open.

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:02.911
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.

00:01:04.099 --> 00:01:06.895
&gt;&gt; There's a tab here that tells me something. It slid out.

00:01:06.895 --> 00:01:09.520
&gt;&gt; A-ha, it signifies that you can open

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:12.520
it there and we call that a signifier.

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:16.840
&gt;&gt; [NOISE]

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:18.120
Oh, you shouldn't have.

00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:19.200
&gt;&gt; It's okay.

00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:25.050
I'm Kristian Simsarian.

00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:30.246
&gt;&gt; And I'm Don Norman.

00:01:30.246 --> 00:01:32.600
&gt;&gt; And I'm Chelsey Glasson,

00:01:35.230 --> 00:01:38.270
and together, we'll be teaching the Design of Everyday Things.

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:41.620
&gt;&gt; Look around you. Everything is designed. If you thought a

00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:45.200
designer was the one who helped you choose curtains, then we'll show

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:48.780
you that it's broader and deeper. It's about how things look,

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:52.050
how they work, and just as importantly, how they make you feel.

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:56.150
&gt;&gt; And, we're going to give you the scientific principals behind good

00:01:56.150 --> 00:02:00.040
design. The things that make it understandable. You already know three.

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:03.440
Affordances, signifiers, and conceptual models.

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:06.590
&gt;&gt; We'll also help you take the first

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:09.240
steps in designing the world around you, yourself.
