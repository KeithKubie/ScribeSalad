00:00:00.499 --> 00:00:02.950
This part of the request is
called the header section,

00:00:02.950 --> 00:00:04.689
as it contains the headers.

00:00:04.689 --> 00:00:08.108
Headers are additional data
about the request itself.

00:00:08.108 --> 00:00:09.939
A lot of these headers
are standardized

00:00:09.939 --> 00:00:12.489
and contain information
like what type of browser

00:00:12.490 --> 00:00:16.269
is making the request, what kind
of format the browser supports,

00:00:16.269 --> 00:00:18.550
and what version of
the document is already

00:00:18.550 --> 00:00:20.536
available in the
browser's local cache.

00:00:20.536 --> 00:00:21.910
All of these
headers are optional

00:00:21.910 --> 00:00:23.620
except for the host header.

00:00:23.620 --> 00:00:25.660
The smallest request
that can be made

00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:29.810
would only consist of the
first line and a host header.

00:00:29.809 --> 00:00:32.000
At a first glance,
a response looks

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:33.770
very similar to a request.

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:37.220
The biggest difference is
probably the first line.

00:00:37.219 --> 00:00:39.019
Here you can find
out the status code

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:42.020
of the response that indicates
if your request was fulfilled

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:44.480
successfully, if the
document was not found,

00:00:44.479 --> 00:00:48.229
or if the server wants to
redirect you somewhere else.

00:00:48.229 --> 00:00:50.659
Just like with the
request, the next section

00:00:50.659 --> 00:00:52.429
is the header section.

00:00:52.429 --> 00:00:55.350
It not only contains
data about the document,

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:58.280
but also about the server
and the connection.

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:00.380
Again, most of these
headers are optional.

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:03.800
The only obligatory header
is content-length to tell

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:07.189
the client how many bytes
of data it should expect.

00:01:07.189 --> 00:01:09.560
After the headers and an
additional empty line,

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:11.540
the actual document is sent.

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:14.630
This can be a JPEG
image an HTML document

00:01:14.629 --> 00:01:17.610
or whatever you want to
transfer to the user.
