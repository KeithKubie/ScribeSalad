00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.216
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:06.216 --> 00:00:07.590
SPEAKER: Without
further ado, I'm

00:00:07.590 --> 00:00:09.960
going to introduce Nadia Lopez.

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:12.390
In 2015, she was the
principal and founder

00:00:12.390 --> 00:00:16.079
of Mott Hall Bridges
Academy, a school in one

00:00:16.079 --> 00:00:17.820
of America's
poorest communities.

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:20.880
And she rose to fame when
the blog, Humans of New York,

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:23.710
featured an eighth-grader
from her school who,

00:00:23.710 --> 00:00:26.580
when asked, who influenced
you the most in life,

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:28.580
responded with, my principal.

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:32.159
The post became a huge hit,
received over 1 million likes

00:00:32.159 --> 00:00:36.180
on Facebook, and really thrust
Dr. Lopez and her school

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:37.472
into the spotlight.

00:00:37.472 --> 00:00:39.180
And she's going to be
talking to us today

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:42.540
about her book, "The
Bridge to Brilliance,"

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:45.685
which really
chronicles educators

00:00:45.685 --> 00:00:47.310
who are trying to
improve opportunities

00:00:47.310 --> 00:00:48.690
for all of America's children.

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:49.710
So without further ado--

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:50.460
Dr. Lopez.

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:56.610
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:58.050
NADIA LOPEZ: Can
you all hear me?

00:00:58.050 --> 00:00:59.670
Good.

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:02.160
So good afternoon.

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:03.960
I just got back from Dubai.

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:05.790
I was there for a week.

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:11.400
I was selected last year as
one of the top 50 educators

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:15.510
in the world from an
organization called the Varkey

00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:16.050
Foundation.

00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:18.600
They host what's called
the Global Teacher Prize.

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:23.340
And so they convened all of us
together in the beautiful city

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:29.100
of Dubai to be in a think
tank, to improve education,

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:31.770
to talk about some
of the challenges.

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:34.350
And while I was
there yesterday, I

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:36.900
was invited by
Dr. Abdulla who is

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:43.080
in charge of an organization
known as the Knowledge

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:44.739
and Human Development Authority.

00:01:44.739 --> 00:01:47.280
And pretty much what they do
is, kind of, like the chancellor

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:51.000
of New York, they
evaluate and support

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.249
schools that are
located inside of Dubai.

00:01:54.249 --> 00:01:56.790
Immediately, when I walk in--
and the reason why I'm starting

00:01:56.790 --> 00:02:00.500
this is to build up to
what my presentation

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:02.700
and my conversation
really is about--

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:05.970
is that you walk in, and it's
like when I walked into Google

00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:07.320
the first time.

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:11.280
This space is where people
are happy to be at work,

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:12.450
and it's unconventional.

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:15.390
It's not like what you've been
taught when you were in school,

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:17.670
that everything will
be a desk and chairs,

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:19.560
and everyone will
be to themselves.

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:22.350
It's actually a space
where people convene,

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:26.040
and the culture is, we
are here to work together

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:27.000
collaboratively.

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:28.920
We are here to solve
world problems.

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:30.690
We are here to make life better.

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:32.590
And we are here to enjoy it.

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:35.610
So yesterday was
international Happiness Day.

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:39.010
I don't know if you are
aware of that, but it was.

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:42.210
And so they had a whole
bunch of balloons,

00:02:42.210 --> 00:02:46.230
and the guy who's on the
bike is actually the greeter.

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:48.510
And he goes around, and
he gives people envelopes

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:50.820
filled with happiness notes.

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:51.510
You can walk in.

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:54.191
You write a happy note to
someone, and he goes around,

00:02:54.191 --> 00:02:56.565
and he just distributes it to
anyone who is in the space.

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:02.280
I happened to get
a load of balloons

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:07.110
and stand in this space as
well and celebrate with them.

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:08.460
And I will say this.

00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:10.740
Like, I just
imagine what it will

00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:13.290
be like for kids to
walk into a space

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:14.820
and have balloons
that are presented

00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:19.300
to tell them that they are
indeed honored and to be happy.

00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:22.830
And then, there is a space
where you can recalibrate

00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:24.990
your mind and center your soul.

00:03:24.990 --> 00:03:26.760
And they actually
told me that they

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:29.964
got this idea because
someone came to visit Google.

00:03:29.964 --> 00:03:31.380
And when they
walked in, they said

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:35.460
this is what education
should feel and look like.

00:03:35.460 --> 00:03:37.470
So my conversation
is about my book,

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:38.694
"The Bridge to Brilliance."

00:03:38.694 --> 00:03:40.860
But I'm really going to
take you through the context

00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:43.650
of what it is to be in a
community like Brownsville,

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:47.400
and why I created a space in
which I want children to really

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:52.650
be happy, so that they can
really strive for success.

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:54.810
Just to give you a little
bit of background context

00:03:54.810 --> 00:03:57.520
about Brownsville, Brooklyn--

00:03:57.520 --> 00:03:58.710
Mott Hall Bridges Academy.

00:03:58.710 --> 00:04:02.100
We have 203 scholars in
sixth to eighth grade.

00:04:02.100 --> 00:04:05.270
97% of them are
Black and Latino.

00:04:05.270 --> 00:04:08.370
87% have free or reduced lunch.

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:12.300
30% have been
identified and diagnosed

00:04:12.300 --> 00:04:14.550
with some type of
special need, so they

00:04:14.550 --> 00:04:17.610
have an individualized
education plan.

00:04:17.610 --> 00:04:21.017
But if I can put it on paper
and evaluate all of my scholars,

00:04:21.017 --> 00:04:23.100
I would tell you, it would
be more along the lines

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:26.750
of 65% who have special needs.

00:04:26.750 --> 00:04:31.980
88% of our scholars come in with
a kindergarten-to-third-grade

00:04:31.980 --> 00:04:35.790
reading or math
capability level.

00:04:35.790 --> 00:04:40.486
In the seven years that I've
been open, we've lost $600,000.

00:04:40.486 --> 00:04:42.360
We've lost a little bit
more, but rounding it

00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:45.720
out-- $600,000 in terms
of our allocation.

00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:48.270
And that's really because
we have to compete

00:04:48.270 --> 00:04:49.800
with charter schools.

00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:51.630
So let me be very clear.

00:04:51.630 --> 00:04:53.790
I'm not against charter schools.

00:04:53.790 --> 00:04:56.850
I'm all about providing
children with opportunities

00:04:56.850 --> 00:05:00.210
and the ability to have the
best education possible.

00:05:00.210 --> 00:05:02.790
What I am against
is when we start

00:05:02.790 --> 00:05:06.540
to target schools and
talk about what we're not

00:05:06.540 --> 00:05:09.690
doing in terms empowering
children, as opposed

00:05:09.690 --> 00:05:11.730
to coming together
collaboratively

00:05:11.730 --> 00:05:15.510
to improve instruction,
to share resources.

00:05:15.510 --> 00:05:17.610
And let me be clear
on that as well.

00:05:17.610 --> 00:05:22.050
If my budget is $2 million,
and my salaries for teachers

00:05:22.050 --> 00:05:26.550
is $1.5 to $1.8
million, I'm only

00:05:26.550 --> 00:05:29.820
left with, maybe,
$300,000 for anything else

00:05:29.820 --> 00:05:31.380
to run the school.

00:05:31.380 --> 00:05:35.220
A charter school may have
a budget of $6 million.

00:05:35.220 --> 00:05:39.090
They get the same
$2 million that I

00:05:39.090 --> 00:05:41.820
would get to run the
school, but they're actually

00:05:41.820 --> 00:05:44.466
able to fund-raise.

00:05:44.466 --> 00:05:45.840
And people who
are on their board

00:05:45.840 --> 00:05:48.660
can fund-raise money
and get them grants.

00:05:48.660 --> 00:05:50.860
I don't have that luxury.

00:05:50.860 --> 00:05:52.800
So when we talk about
equity and education,

00:05:52.800 --> 00:05:55.110
and we talk about what
public school is not doing,

00:05:55.110 --> 00:05:57.690
we need to have an authentic
conversation about what's

00:05:57.690 --> 00:06:03.560
lacking in terms of support, the
access, and the opportunities.

00:06:03.560 --> 00:06:06.660
61% of my teachers
have zero-to-five years

00:06:06.660 --> 00:06:10.440
of teaching
experience, and 39% who

00:06:10.440 --> 00:06:13.072
have more than that have
worked at failing schools.

00:06:13.072 --> 00:06:15.030
I put that in there
because it's very important

00:06:15.030 --> 00:06:16.710
that you understand.

00:06:16.710 --> 00:06:19.770
My teachers who come to me that
are new teachers who have zero

00:06:19.770 --> 00:06:22.620
to five years don't
have teaching experience

00:06:22.620 --> 00:06:24.210
anywhere else.

00:06:24.210 --> 00:06:25.710
So what my teachers
don't understand

00:06:25.710 --> 00:06:29.330
is that we're really the
country club of education.

00:06:29.330 --> 00:06:32.990
My school, the space,
how it's created,

00:06:32.990 --> 00:06:35.060
is not the challenging
space of when

00:06:35.060 --> 00:06:39.370
I came up as a school teacher.

00:06:39.370 --> 00:06:41.680
My teachers don't know what
it's like to be in a space

00:06:41.680 --> 00:06:45.280
when an administrator
demeans and demoralizes you.

00:06:45.280 --> 00:06:47.590
My teachers don't know
a space where teachers

00:06:47.590 --> 00:06:49.750
are allowed to
disrespect children,

00:06:49.750 --> 00:06:53.260
and children are allowed
to disrespect teachers.

00:06:53.260 --> 00:06:56.560
My teachers do not know what
it's like not to have supplies,

00:06:56.560 --> 00:07:00.070
because I don't take any
additional money past what

00:07:00.070 --> 00:07:03.460
I make, and I do not pay any of
the administrators additional

00:07:03.460 --> 00:07:06.190
money past what they
make on a yearly salary,

00:07:06.190 --> 00:07:10.150
to make sure that we have
everything that we need.

00:07:10.150 --> 00:07:15.810
So I work from 7:30 to
8:00, 9:00, 10:00 at night.

00:07:15.810 --> 00:07:18.780
My hours are 7:30 to 3:30.

00:07:18.780 --> 00:07:21.540
Technically, I'm
entitled to overtime.

00:07:21.540 --> 00:07:25.800
But this is my work, and
I feel that because I

00:07:25.800 --> 00:07:29.670
serve these children, because
this is my life's calling,

00:07:29.670 --> 00:07:31.785
I'm not going to
take a dime extra.

00:07:31.785 --> 00:07:37.190
My teachers, however, because
they work for a union,

00:07:37.190 --> 00:07:44.550
are entitled to make $45.66
extra after they've worked

00:07:44.550 --> 00:07:47.570
six hours and 20 minutes.

00:07:47.570 --> 00:07:49.420
So if I ask my teachers
to stay after school

00:07:49.420 --> 00:07:54.490
to do any additional work, if
they host any type of clubs,

00:07:54.490 --> 00:08:00.490
if they run any teams, they
are entitled to make $45.66.

00:08:00.490 --> 00:08:04.330
That's additional money that
comes out of our budget.

00:08:04.330 --> 00:08:08.770
The 39% of the teachers who
came from failing schools,

00:08:08.770 --> 00:08:10.420
they understand it.

00:08:10.420 --> 00:08:11.352
They get it.

00:08:11.352 --> 00:08:13.060
They know that they're
in a country club,

00:08:13.060 --> 00:08:15.440
and they appreciate the space.

00:08:15.440 --> 00:08:19.850
But they're also in a
place of, they want more.

00:08:19.850 --> 00:08:21.940
They want the opportunities
for leadership.

00:08:21.940 --> 00:08:23.380
And when you're
in a small school,

00:08:23.380 --> 00:08:26.860
you often have to worry
about it taking one person

00:08:26.860 --> 00:08:28.635
to do three or four jobs.

00:08:28.635 --> 00:08:30.760
So I have to manage the
space in which I don't want

00:08:30.760 --> 00:08:32.289
my teachers to feel burned out.

00:08:32.289 --> 00:08:34.330
I want them to know that
they're in a space where

00:08:34.330 --> 00:08:36.549
we love and care about them
just as we love and care

00:08:36.549 --> 00:08:41.679
about the kids, but I want them
to be able to thrive as well.

00:08:44.250 --> 00:08:51.010
So Brownsville, Brooklyn is
about one mile square radius.

00:08:51.010 --> 00:08:53.090
We have 80,000 residents.

00:08:53.090 --> 00:08:57.280
Only 32% of our residents
have a high school diploma,

00:08:57.280 --> 00:09:00.220
only 14% have a
bachelor's degree,

00:09:00.220 --> 00:09:04.720
and only 3% have a master's.

00:09:04.720 --> 00:09:08.740
We have the highest crime
rate in all of New York City.

00:09:08.740 --> 00:09:10.840
We have the lowest
parental involvement.

00:09:10.840 --> 00:09:15.010
So out of the 203 kids that I
have, that attend my school,

00:09:15.010 --> 00:09:16.930
I am lucky if I could
get five parents

00:09:16.930 --> 00:09:19.600
in for a
parent-teachers meeting.

00:09:19.600 --> 00:09:21.160
Not a principal's meeting--

00:09:21.160 --> 00:09:24.580
but at our PTA meetings,
we only get five parents.

00:09:24.580 --> 00:09:26.590
In order to do
anything in the school,

00:09:26.590 --> 00:09:28.430
we need seven
parents for a quorum.

00:09:31.140 --> 00:09:33.960
In order to make any changes,
we need seven parents

00:09:33.960 --> 00:09:35.580
for a quorum on our PTA.

00:09:35.580 --> 00:09:37.860
We only get five parents.

00:09:37.860 --> 00:09:41.040
So unfortunately, my
PTA can't get as much

00:09:41.040 --> 00:09:42.390
as they would like done.

00:09:42.390 --> 00:09:45.090
So they have to trust
that I as a principal

00:09:45.090 --> 00:09:49.830
will do what's in the best
interests of their children.

00:09:49.830 --> 00:09:54.510
The average income is $11,000
in the housing developments.

00:09:54.510 --> 00:09:57.420
So those projects-- we
have the most projects

00:09:57.420 --> 00:10:00.060
in all of the United States.

00:10:00.060 --> 00:10:03.480
$11,000-- on the
outskirts, though,

00:10:03.480 --> 00:10:08.172
which are the small residential
homes, it's $28,000.

00:10:08.172 --> 00:10:10.130
They say, to live in New
York City, at minimum,

00:10:10.130 --> 00:10:12.960
you need $45,000.

00:10:12.960 --> 00:10:18.380
How many of you can
live off of $11,000?

00:10:18.380 --> 00:10:21.020
Maybe for some of you
when you were 15 or 14,

00:10:21.020 --> 00:10:25.010
but not as an adult. And
many of our residents,

00:10:25.010 --> 00:10:26.600
our children
included, have never

00:10:26.600 --> 00:10:29.150
ventured beyond their community.

00:10:29.150 --> 00:10:31.640
I also want to
press upon you this.

00:10:31.640 --> 00:10:34.760
We have the highest health
risk in all of New York City.

00:10:37.280 --> 00:10:41.920
HIV and AIDS is the
highest in Brownsville--

00:10:41.920 --> 00:10:44.495
the average age range, 11 to 21.

00:10:47.020 --> 00:10:48.230
I'm going to say it again--

00:10:48.230 --> 00:10:51.240
11 to 21 .

00:10:51.240 --> 00:10:55.060
Highest in cholesterol,
highest in heart disease,

00:10:55.060 --> 00:10:59.690
highest in asthma,
highest in cancer.

00:10:59.690 --> 00:11:04.190
So on top of not having healthy
living, healthy nutrition--

00:11:04.190 --> 00:11:07.800
on top of all of these other
things, you think to yourself,

00:11:07.800 --> 00:11:09.830
wow, this is in
Brooklyn, New York.

00:11:09.830 --> 00:11:13.120
How many of you have
been to Brooklyn?

00:11:13.120 --> 00:11:14.660
OK.

00:11:14.660 --> 00:11:17.540
Downtown Brooklyn--
now Downtown Brooklyn

00:11:17.540 --> 00:11:19.340
is known as DoBro or
something like that?

00:11:19.340 --> 00:11:20.090
I don't even know.

00:11:20.090 --> 00:11:21.601
Like, I'm so against it.

00:11:21.601 --> 00:11:22.100
Right?

00:11:22.100 --> 00:11:22.490
[LAUGHTER]

00:11:22.490 --> 00:11:24.320
Because I'm Brooklyn
all day, and I'm like,

00:11:24.320 --> 00:11:27.020
it's Downtown Brooklyn.

00:11:27.020 --> 00:11:28.680
But you think about it.

00:11:28.680 --> 00:11:33.560
Here are all of these great
erected buildings with glass--

00:11:33.560 --> 00:11:35.150
Century 21, Target.

00:11:35.150 --> 00:11:36.990
It's phenomenal.

00:11:36.990 --> 00:11:37.970
You go to Williamsburg.

00:11:37.970 --> 00:11:39.700
People are hustling
and bustling.

00:11:39.700 --> 00:11:45.340
And then, you go to Brownsville,
and none of that is happening.

00:11:45.340 --> 00:11:49.320
You don't feel
excited to be there.

00:11:49.320 --> 00:11:52.600
You're surviving.

00:11:52.600 --> 00:11:55.800
So our challenges--
as I stated, highest

00:11:55.800 --> 00:11:57.960
density of housing
developments in New York City.

00:11:57.960 --> 00:12:00.900
We lack safe places.

00:12:00.900 --> 00:12:03.840
So in the summertime,
kids stay in their houses.

00:12:03.840 --> 00:12:09.380
Idle hands, idle minds
become dangerous.

00:12:09.380 --> 00:12:14.170
We have a lot of shootings
that happen in the summertime.

00:12:14.170 --> 00:12:16.390
Schools are competing
for other children,

00:12:16.390 --> 00:12:19.300
so we have to compete
with charter schools.

00:12:19.300 --> 00:12:22.570
And smart but not
so smart for us--

00:12:22.570 --> 00:12:25.582
charters now start at fifth
grade for their middle schools.

00:12:25.582 --> 00:12:27.040
So what that means
is, it undercuts

00:12:27.040 --> 00:12:29.020
us who start at sixth grade.

00:12:29.020 --> 00:12:31.000
So they start to look
at public schools,

00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:33.160
take the kids from
fourth grade, and have

00:12:33.160 --> 00:12:36.240
them come into the
schools at fifth grade.

00:12:36.240 --> 00:12:38.920
I'm looking for kids when
they start sixth grade.

00:12:38.920 --> 00:12:40.870
Most of the time,
when I get the kids,

00:12:40.870 --> 00:12:43.810
it's because they didn't make
it in the charter schools.

00:12:43.810 --> 00:12:48.310
So let me give you a
little inside track.

00:12:48.310 --> 00:12:52.050
October 31 is when our budgets
close in New York City.

00:12:52.050 --> 00:12:53.080
OK?

00:12:53.080 --> 00:12:54.790
So whoever's sitting
in our classrooms,

00:12:54.790 --> 00:12:58.900
if I have all of you
in here on October 30,

00:12:58.900 --> 00:13:01.470
I get money for each
and every one of you.

00:13:01.470 --> 00:13:03.340
If you have special
needs, they give

00:13:03.340 --> 00:13:06.220
me, about, $10,000 per child.

00:13:06.220 --> 00:13:08.744
If my child doesn't have
special needs, it's $4,500.

00:13:08.744 --> 00:13:10.660
And I'm gonna give you
context about the money

00:13:10.660 --> 00:13:13.480
as well, in terms
of the numbers.

00:13:13.480 --> 00:13:16.260
Now, charter schools--

00:13:16.260 --> 00:13:20.940
November 1st, that child
whose behavior is not

00:13:20.940 --> 00:13:22.680
something we can manage--

00:13:22.680 --> 00:13:25.440
they may need services
that we can't provide.

00:13:25.440 --> 00:13:27.660
The parent isn't
really supportive.

00:13:27.660 --> 00:13:31.380
On November 1st, that
child is coming to me

00:13:31.380 --> 00:13:34.642
without any of the money
that has been allocated.

00:13:37.360 --> 00:13:40.860
So I have to service this
child without the money.

00:13:40.860 --> 00:13:41.850
Right?

00:13:41.850 --> 00:13:44.269
But the charter school
gets to keep the money.

00:13:44.269 --> 00:13:45.810
Now, here's the
other thing about it.

00:13:48.600 --> 00:13:52.320
New York City Department
of Education--

00:13:52.320 --> 00:13:56.089
we have a lot of people
in a lot of offices.

00:13:56.089 --> 00:13:57.630
Those of us who are
in schools, we're

00:13:57.630 --> 00:14:00.270
paying for those people
who are in offices.

00:14:00.270 --> 00:14:03.630
In charter schools, the
actual money that's allocated

00:14:03.630 --> 00:14:05.200
for children per state--

00:14:05.200 --> 00:14:09.510
let me give you a round-about--
maybe, $12,000 per child.

00:14:09.510 --> 00:14:10.014
Right?

00:14:10.014 --> 00:14:11.430
So if I have a
charter school, I'm

00:14:11.430 --> 00:14:14.040
going to get $12,000 per child.

00:14:14.040 --> 00:14:15.750
Because the idea is
that charter schools

00:14:15.750 --> 00:14:18.330
are supposed to get their
own buildings that they're

00:14:18.330 --> 00:14:20.130
supposed to pay for.

00:14:20.130 --> 00:14:23.716
They're supposed to lease them
or build them, whichever way.

00:14:23.716 --> 00:14:26.620
In a New York City public
school, as a principal,

00:14:26.620 --> 00:14:31.910
I only get $45,000 per child.

00:14:31.910 --> 00:14:35.000
New York state
allocates $12,000.

00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:37.880
If I'm in a charter
school, I get $12,000.

00:14:37.880 --> 00:14:41.460
If I'm in a New York City
public school, I get $4,500.

00:14:41.460 --> 00:14:45.210
That's because as a New York
City public school principal,

00:14:45.210 --> 00:14:47.520
we're actually paying for
all of the other people who

00:14:47.520 --> 00:14:50.330
are working in the
Department of Ed.

00:14:50.330 --> 00:14:51.960
But charter schools
are co-located

00:14:51.960 --> 00:14:57.350
in our public buildings, so
they don't have to pay rent.

00:14:57.350 --> 00:14:59.210
They don't have
to lease anything.

00:14:59.210 --> 00:15:02.490
That's why they end up
with more money than us.

00:15:02.490 --> 00:15:03.510
Right?

00:15:03.510 --> 00:15:05.880
All they do is pay $1.

00:15:05.880 --> 00:15:10.180
That was under Mike Bloomberg--
$1 to use our spaces.

00:15:10.180 --> 00:15:12.060
So when you hear the
arguments, no one

00:15:12.060 --> 00:15:14.860
ever has those conversations.

00:15:14.860 --> 00:15:16.920
So we're always
at a disadvantage.

00:15:21.100 --> 00:15:24.330
Despite all of
that, I still wanted

00:15:24.330 --> 00:15:27.790
to open a school
to close a prison.

00:15:27.790 --> 00:15:29.570
Because I get it.

00:15:29.570 --> 00:15:33.560
I understand that it's systemic.

00:15:33.560 --> 00:15:38.120
I understand that those who
are not in the education system

00:15:38.120 --> 00:15:39.710
have no idea.

00:15:39.710 --> 00:15:42.680
And all you hear are
the people who complain,

00:15:42.680 --> 00:15:45.560
the people who tell the story,
the narrative that makes them

00:15:45.560 --> 00:15:48.450
feel good to push an agenda.

00:15:48.450 --> 00:15:50.070
But at the end of
the day, I'm dealing

00:15:50.070 --> 00:15:52.450
with children who survive
every single day, who

00:15:52.450 --> 00:15:54.540
are not asking you to
save them, but need

00:15:54.540 --> 00:15:57.400
access and opportunity.

00:15:57.400 --> 00:15:59.200
And the reason why my
children aren't what

00:15:59.200 --> 00:16:02.287
they call proficient and
they're not doing extremely well

00:16:02.287 --> 00:16:04.120
is because we're not
dealing with the issues

00:16:04.120 --> 00:16:06.700
that they're dealing with
on a day-to-day basis.

00:16:06.700 --> 00:16:08.260
The post-traumatic
stress disorder

00:16:08.260 --> 00:16:11.410
that comes with poverty,
that comes with the fact

00:16:11.410 --> 00:16:14.380
that when you don't have a
parent in a household or you

00:16:14.380 --> 00:16:20.110
have parents in the household
who are as young as 20, 18, 19,

00:16:20.110 --> 00:16:22.060
or you have five,
six, seven eight

00:16:22.060 --> 00:16:27.450
siblings in a household,
that's a lot to undertake.

00:16:27.450 --> 00:16:29.786
And so we can complain
about what parents should do

00:16:29.786 --> 00:16:32.160
and what we should do with
this community, but I live it,

00:16:32.160 --> 00:16:33.460
and I breathe it
every single day.

00:16:33.460 --> 00:16:35.043
So it's about, what
are we going to do

00:16:35.043 --> 00:16:39.490
in terms of turning this into
an opportunity for solutions.

00:16:39.490 --> 00:16:43.790
And so my belief is,
I want to make sure

00:16:43.790 --> 00:16:46.327
that children take
over this world

00:16:46.327 --> 00:16:47.660
and become globally competitive.

00:16:47.660 --> 00:16:49.493
Because the reality is
that every job is not

00:16:49.493 --> 00:16:51.290
going to be here in
the United States,

00:16:51.290 --> 00:16:53.930
and they need to have
opportunities of going abroad.

00:16:53.930 --> 00:16:56.660
But they need to be able
to become accepting--

00:16:56.660 --> 00:16:59.090
not just tolerant but
accepting of others,

00:16:59.090 --> 00:17:03.710
be able to communicate,
be able to empathize,

00:17:03.710 --> 00:17:09.300
be able to show
respect, and be loving.

00:17:09.300 --> 00:17:12.419
I need to have teachers who are
passionate about what they do,

00:17:12.419 --> 00:17:14.710
and not there just because
they're trying to figure out

00:17:14.710 --> 00:17:17.470
what they are going to do.

00:17:17.470 --> 00:17:19.170
That's part of
opening up a school,

00:17:19.170 --> 00:17:21.700
because there are a
lot of people who say,

00:17:21.700 --> 00:17:23.040
I want to teach.

00:17:23.040 --> 00:17:26.829
Any of you tried
teaching before?

00:17:26.829 --> 00:17:27.872
Yeah.

00:17:27.872 --> 00:17:29.080
Great to be at Google, right?

00:17:29.080 --> 00:17:31.090
[LAUGHTER]

00:17:31.090 --> 00:17:33.201
It's hard, yes?

00:17:33.201 --> 00:17:33.700
It's hard.

00:17:37.060 --> 00:17:38.620
So it feels good.

00:17:38.620 --> 00:17:41.650
It feels like this is
a great opportunity

00:17:41.650 --> 00:17:44.380
to do something to
help someone else,

00:17:44.380 --> 00:17:46.060
but you're not learning
that in school.

00:17:46.060 --> 00:17:48.382
You're not learning
the real context of,

00:17:48.382 --> 00:17:49.840
there are some real
issues you have

00:17:49.840 --> 00:17:52.851
to deal with before you can
even get to the content.

00:17:52.851 --> 00:17:54.100
And how do you deal with that?

00:17:54.100 --> 00:17:55.308
How do you deal with poverty?

00:17:55.308 --> 00:17:57.840
How do you deal with children
who can't read on grade level?

00:17:57.840 --> 00:18:00.090
How do you deal with not
having enough supplies?

00:18:00.090 --> 00:18:01.950
How do you deal with
that administrator who

00:18:01.950 --> 00:18:03.720
could care less about
what you're doing

00:18:03.720 --> 00:18:04.720
and doesn't support you?

00:18:04.720 --> 00:18:09.160
How do you deal with crazy?

00:18:09.160 --> 00:18:13.060
There should be a class,
Crazy 101, Public Education.

00:18:13.060 --> 00:18:16.240
But it doesn't exist.

00:18:16.240 --> 00:18:18.410
I also needed to make
sure that parents

00:18:18.410 --> 00:18:20.864
are aware of what's going on
in Mott Hall Bridges Academy

00:18:20.864 --> 00:18:21.780
and trust the process.

00:18:21.780 --> 00:18:24.590
I told you, I get five parents
in, but I bet you this.

00:18:24.590 --> 00:18:27.680
All 203 kids-- their
parents trust me.

00:18:27.680 --> 00:18:30.030
They won't show up.

00:18:30.030 --> 00:18:33.200
A lot of them just trust me.

00:18:33.200 --> 00:18:35.180
They'll show up for graduation.

00:18:35.180 --> 00:18:36.909
They'll give me a hug.

00:18:36.909 --> 00:18:39.200
The entire family will be
there, and they'll say to me,

00:18:39.200 --> 00:18:40.860
Ms. Lopez, we love
you, thank you,

00:18:40.860 --> 00:18:42.140
and all these great things.

00:18:42.140 --> 00:18:46.160
And I always try to remind
them, it doesn't stop here.

00:18:46.160 --> 00:18:50.180
I fought for your child even
when you weren't present.

00:18:50.180 --> 00:18:52.310
But your child is going to
enter high school, where

00:18:52.310 --> 00:18:54.310
they're going to have to
just defend themselves,

00:18:54.310 --> 00:18:56.270
and we tried our
best to support them,

00:18:56.270 --> 00:19:00.650
to help them navigate, to
advocate for themselves.

00:19:00.650 --> 00:19:03.140
You can't trust the system.

00:19:03.140 --> 00:19:04.860
So I thank them all the time.

00:19:04.860 --> 00:19:06.950
They're giving me the
most precious gifts,

00:19:06.950 --> 00:19:09.030
which is their child.

00:19:09.030 --> 00:19:11.670
But they shouldn't trust
everyone with that.

00:19:11.670 --> 00:19:14.520
I have a 15-year-old daughter.

00:19:14.520 --> 00:19:16.530
People see me coming
in her school building,

00:19:16.530 --> 00:19:21.910
it's like-- oh, god, hi,
Ms. Lopez, is everything OK?

00:19:21.910 --> 00:19:23.610
No, I need to see
such-and-such teacher.

00:19:23.610 --> 00:19:24.870
Let me tell you, the
first thing they'll say

00:19:24.870 --> 00:19:27.090
is, um, you can take
the elevator upstairs.

00:19:27.090 --> 00:19:28.170
No one will escort me.

00:19:28.170 --> 00:19:29.586
It's just like,
we don't even want

00:19:29.586 --> 00:19:31.890
to be part of the conversation.

00:19:31.890 --> 00:19:32.890
Because they get it.

00:19:32.890 --> 00:19:36.210
I don't show up unless
there's a real issue.

00:19:36.210 --> 00:19:37.510
I'm my daughter's advocate.

00:19:37.510 --> 00:19:40.840
I understand the
importance of education,

00:19:40.840 --> 00:19:44.037
and I get that from my
parents, who are immigrants.

00:19:44.037 --> 00:19:46.495
A little background about me--
my mother is from Guatemala,

00:19:46.495 --> 00:19:48.760
and my father is from Honduras.

00:19:48.760 --> 00:19:51.664
They do not have a formal
education, in terms of-- they

00:19:51.664 --> 00:19:53.080
didn't go to high
school, and they

00:19:53.080 --> 00:19:54.310
didn't get a college degree.

00:19:54.310 --> 00:19:56.650
All they did was come
here with the belief

00:19:56.650 --> 00:19:58.780
that opportunity exists.

00:19:58.780 --> 00:20:02.350
They met at a
party in the Bronx.

00:20:02.350 --> 00:20:04.120
My mom played
hard-to-get, and my dad

00:20:04.120 --> 00:20:05.950
was not going to accept no.

00:20:05.950 --> 00:20:10.870
Six months later, they got
married, and they had me.

00:20:10.870 --> 00:20:14.050
My mom had five miscarriages
before she gave birth to me,

00:20:14.050 --> 00:20:17.330
so I'm her miracle baby,
because I was a preemie.

00:20:17.330 --> 00:20:19.850
So when it came to
education, my mother

00:20:19.850 --> 00:20:23.060
found whatever school that
was going to nurture me,

00:20:23.060 --> 00:20:24.950
but she also understood
that it didn't exist

00:20:24.950 --> 00:20:27.410
in our immediate districts.

00:20:27.410 --> 00:20:29.976
The best school was
literally three blocks away,

00:20:29.976 --> 00:20:31.850
but it was in another
district, so my mom had

00:20:31.850 --> 00:20:34.460
to ask a neighbor
to write her lease,

00:20:34.460 --> 00:20:36.830
just so I could
go to that school.

00:20:36.830 --> 00:20:38.510
Had my mom not
done that, I don't

00:20:38.510 --> 00:20:40.843
know if I would be standing
here today, doing the things

00:20:40.843 --> 00:20:42.430
that I'm doing.

00:20:42.430 --> 00:20:44.260
It was the teachers
that she trusted.

00:20:44.260 --> 00:20:47.044
It was the space
that she created.

00:20:47.044 --> 00:20:48.460
It was the
opportunities that they

00:20:48.460 --> 00:20:53.210
provided for me that allow
me to know what is possible.

00:20:53.210 --> 00:20:56.210
Because I lived
during the crack era.

00:20:56.210 --> 00:20:58.460
I lived during the times
that there were gangs running

00:20:58.460 --> 00:21:01.430
rampant in New York City.

00:21:01.430 --> 00:21:03.890
And despite that,
my parents felt

00:21:03.890 --> 00:21:06.490
like we made it through poverty
in Guatemala and Honduras.

00:21:06.490 --> 00:21:07.865
You're going to
get on the train,

00:21:07.865 --> 00:21:09.530
and you're going
to figure it out.

00:21:09.530 --> 00:21:10.380
Mind your business.

00:21:10.380 --> 00:21:11.327
Don't talk to anybody.

00:21:11.327 --> 00:21:12.410
Call us when you get home.

00:21:12.410 --> 00:21:13.534
We didn't have cell phones.

00:21:13.534 --> 00:21:16.190
You better be in the house
at 3:30 when we call you.

00:21:16.190 --> 00:21:16.700
Right?

00:21:16.700 --> 00:21:19.040
When that phone rings,
pick up the phone.

00:21:19.040 --> 00:21:21.650
And that's what I learned.

00:21:21.650 --> 00:21:23.180
But it was also
during middle school

00:21:23.180 --> 00:21:27.080
when my parents separated
that I found the saving

00:21:27.080 --> 00:21:29.600
grace of a school building
with adults who cared enough

00:21:29.600 --> 00:21:34.680
about me, and who let me stay
there until 9:00 at night.

00:21:34.680 --> 00:21:36.870
So when I talk about staying
in my school building,

00:21:36.870 --> 00:21:40.065
I've been doing
it since I was 11.

00:21:40.065 --> 00:21:42.190
And when I created a school
where children can stay

00:21:42.190 --> 00:21:44.440
until 6:00, 7:00 at night--

00:21:44.440 --> 00:21:48.610
even 10:00 if they want to,
it's because I understand

00:21:48.610 --> 00:21:51.820
that by creating that
space, I'm making sure

00:21:51.820 --> 00:21:55.000
that a young lady is not
going to get pregnant,

00:21:55.000 --> 00:21:57.840
that a young man is not
going to end up getting shot,

00:21:57.840 --> 00:22:00.730
and that he's not going
to be recruited by gangs.

00:22:00.730 --> 00:22:04.190
That's my reality
every single day.

00:22:04.190 --> 00:22:08.720
So off of my experiences,
I've created a space

00:22:08.720 --> 00:22:12.104
where I wanted to believe
that children would be happy

00:22:12.104 --> 00:22:16.770
and that they understood
that they were honored.

00:22:16.770 --> 00:22:21.230
And so one, it
starts with my team.

00:22:21.230 --> 00:22:25.070
A great leader understands that
it can't be done by themselves.

00:22:25.070 --> 00:22:26.285
I mean, I could go by myself.

00:22:26.285 --> 00:22:27.470
[LAUGHTER]

00:22:27.470 --> 00:22:28.340
Because I could.

00:22:28.340 --> 00:22:32.390
However, I need to have a team.

00:22:32.390 --> 00:22:35.865
So I get to choose my teachers.

00:22:35.865 --> 00:22:37.490
I want to be very
clear on saying this.

00:22:37.490 --> 00:22:40.550
I always say I want to be clear,
because it's also going online.

00:22:40.550 --> 00:22:44.150
Everyone is not made
for every single space.

00:22:44.150 --> 00:22:46.400
So those of you who tried
out teaching and figured,

00:22:46.400 --> 00:22:48.920
this isn't really for
me, I'm that person

00:22:48.920 --> 00:22:52.130
that helps you understand
this really isn't for you.

00:22:52.130 --> 00:22:54.860
Let's figure out what
you're really good at.

00:22:54.860 --> 00:22:57.560
The reason why I do that
is because I actually

00:22:57.560 --> 00:23:00.800
sat in spaces with adults--

00:23:00.800 --> 00:23:05.880
principals who
would take the time

00:23:05.880 --> 00:23:07.865
to assassinate the
character of teachers

00:23:07.865 --> 00:23:08.990
and go after their license.

00:23:11.570 --> 00:23:14.360
I don't think that's fair.

00:23:14.360 --> 00:23:16.430
You might do better on
the Upper West Side.

00:23:16.430 --> 00:23:19.190
You may do better
with high school.

00:23:19.190 --> 00:23:21.110
You may do better with
elementary school.

00:23:21.110 --> 00:23:23.620
Middle school is a beast.

00:23:23.620 --> 00:23:24.625
Children are very sassy.

00:23:27.160 --> 00:23:28.737
They can be very defiant.

00:23:28.737 --> 00:23:30.820
They have little personalities,
but they're trying

00:23:30.820 --> 00:23:32.740
to figure themselves out.

00:23:32.740 --> 00:23:35.350
It takes a special
type of person

00:23:35.350 --> 00:23:37.730
who can love them
through all of that--

00:23:37.730 --> 00:23:40.630
and a lot of patience.

00:23:40.630 --> 00:23:41.880
OK?

00:23:41.880 --> 00:23:44.730
So I'm that person who
will help you identify,

00:23:44.730 --> 00:23:47.670
is this the profession for you?

00:23:47.670 --> 00:23:51.740
Or maybe we need to go
to another great level.

00:23:51.740 --> 00:23:55.540
But I also want my teachers
to develop a sense of trust,

00:23:55.540 --> 00:23:57.370
because we are a team.

00:23:57.370 --> 00:23:59.740
So I used a good analogy
with my team, maybe,

00:23:59.740 --> 00:24:02.830
three weeks ago, where we
talked about the Super Bowl.

00:24:02.830 --> 00:24:05.010
Any of you watch the Super Bowl?

00:24:05.010 --> 00:24:05.830
Some of you?

00:24:05.830 --> 00:24:08.015
OK, so you know that
the Patriots won, right?

00:24:08.015 --> 00:24:08.890
Everybody knows that?

00:24:08.890 --> 00:24:09.680
[LAUGHTER]

00:24:09.680 --> 00:24:10.360
OK.

00:24:10.360 --> 00:24:13.270
And Atlanta was
actually ahead, yes.

00:24:13.270 --> 00:24:16.540
And the biggest upset was
that the Patriots won.

00:24:16.540 --> 00:24:19.330
But I wanted my
teachers to understand,

00:24:19.330 --> 00:24:21.910
something happened in that game.

00:24:21.910 --> 00:24:24.160
Because by all
sense of accounts,

00:24:24.160 --> 00:24:27.610
Atlanta should have
won, by the numbers.

00:24:27.610 --> 00:24:32.650
But something happened as a
turn of events on the field.

00:24:32.650 --> 00:24:34.650
So we watched the videos,
about, six minutes off

00:24:34.650 --> 00:24:37.542
of YouTube, where they watched
from the beginning to the end.

00:24:37.542 --> 00:24:40.000
So even my Spanish teacher
who's in the corner, who doesn't

00:24:40.000 --> 00:24:43.180
understand American football--

00:24:43.180 --> 00:24:44.401
she understood the gist.

00:24:44.401 --> 00:24:46.150
You got to get the
ball on the other side,

00:24:46.150 --> 00:24:47.110
and there are points.

00:24:47.110 --> 00:24:48.526
That's how we
described it to her.

00:24:48.526 --> 00:24:49.780
She understood.

00:24:49.780 --> 00:24:56.050
And so part of the understanding
was that great teams--

00:24:56.050 --> 00:24:58.390
even when you feel
like you're failing,

00:24:58.390 --> 00:25:01.810
you still push through.

00:25:01.810 --> 00:25:04.100
You don't give up.

00:25:04.100 --> 00:25:06.610
You don't let the other
person see you sweat,

00:25:06.610 --> 00:25:10.330
but you also have
studied your opponent.

00:25:10.330 --> 00:25:14.050
So you have to study the kids.

00:25:14.050 --> 00:25:16.750
Even when they're failing and
you feel like you're failing,

00:25:16.750 --> 00:25:20.214
you have to find that there's
something, some good potential

00:25:20.214 --> 00:25:22.630
that's within that room that's
going to give you a winning

00:25:22.630 --> 00:25:24.690
moment.

00:25:24.690 --> 00:25:28.980
Atlanta, on the other
hand, got really

00:25:28.980 --> 00:25:33.210
excited by what they thought
was going to be their win.

00:25:33.210 --> 00:25:35.790
They stopped paying
attention to the game.

00:25:35.790 --> 00:25:38.790
They got too comfortable.

00:25:38.790 --> 00:25:42.210
At the end of the day, when you
have a Tom Brady on your team,

00:25:42.210 --> 00:25:44.460
if it's not the
last three seconds,

00:25:44.460 --> 00:25:47.430
and you're on the other
side of the end zone,

00:25:47.430 --> 00:25:51.010
you don't celebrate.

00:25:51.010 --> 00:25:55.630
Ultimately, a lot of teachers
get happy and keep their eyes

00:25:55.630 --> 00:25:57.280
off of the ball.

00:25:57.280 --> 00:25:58.960
And when things
don't go their way,

00:25:58.960 --> 00:26:01.120
they don't know
how to transition.

00:26:01.120 --> 00:26:03.790
When they're faced with kids
who can't read on grade level,

00:26:03.790 --> 00:26:05.740
they can't figure it out.

00:26:05.740 --> 00:26:07.870
They haven't
studied their craft.

00:26:07.870 --> 00:26:10.030
They haven't mastered
the strategies.

00:26:10.030 --> 00:26:12.580
They haven't asked for help.

00:26:12.580 --> 00:26:19.670
They become isolated, then what
they become is very defensive.

00:26:19.670 --> 00:26:22.750
And then, ultimately,
they give up.

00:26:22.750 --> 00:26:25.555
I don't want anyone to ever
feel that way, not in our space.

00:26:28.220 --> 00:26:32.390
The next thing we do is, we do
a lot of branding at the school.

00:26:32.390 --> 00:26:33.860
We use a lot of positive words.

00:26:33.860 --> 00:26:36.534
So in this particular
case, Occupy Schools

00:26:36.534 --> 00:26:37.700
became part of our movement.

00:26:37.700 --> 00:26:39.710
Every single one of our
scholars gets a t-shirt

00:26:39.710 --> 00:26:41.627
every single year.

00:26:41.627 --> 00:26:43.460
We do it during December
because oftentimes,

00:26:43.460 --> 00:26:45.170
when they go on
break, they're not

00:26:45.170 --> 00:26:48.020
going to get anything
for Christmas-- vacation,

00:26:48.020 --> 00:26:51.027
Christmas gifts or
whatever they celebrate.

00:26:51.027 --> 00:26:52.610
I want them to know
that this is going

00:26:52.610 --> 00:26:54.830
to add on to their uniforms.

00:26:54.830 --> 00:26:56.990
I want them to be reminded
how much I love them,

00:26:56.990 --> 00:27:00.200
and I can't wait to see them
come back in their new shirts.

00:27:00.200 --> 00:27:02.900
And it also takes the burden
off of some of their parents

00:27:02.900 --> 00:27:06.770
who can't afford to purchase
additional uniform tops.

00:27:06.770 --> 00:27:11.090
So Occupy Schools reminds
our parents, our staff,

00:27:11.090 --> 00:27:15.710
our scholars, of the importance
of being in our school spaces.

00:27:15.710 --> 00:27:19.580
If you're not there, if you do
not show up, you don't learn.

00:27:19.580 --> 00:27:22.400
If our teachers don't
come to school on time,

00:27:22.400 --> 00:27:25.490
if they don't show up, it's
like miss a minute, miss a day--

00:27:25.490 --> 00:27:27.800
our kids are going
to miss a lot.

00:27:27.800 --> 00:27:29.710
If our parents
never show up even

00:27:29.710 --> 00:27:31.730
if it is to just
contact me, you'll

00:27:31.730 --> 00:27:34.610
never know what's going on.

00:27:34.610 --> 00:27:37.060
I also call my scholars
Brownsville Brilliance.

00:27:40.130 --> 00:27:44.520
Can anybody tell me how
a diamond is created?

00:27:44.520 --> 00:27:46.650
Pressure, right?

00:27:46.650 --> 00:27:48.420
A lot of pressure.

00:27:48.420 --> 00:27:51.030
I want my kids to
be reminded, there's

00:27:51.030 --> 00:27:53.660
a lot of external pressure--

00:27:53.660 --> 00:27:56.710
the pressure of people who are
not going to believe in you,

00:27:56.710 --> 00:28:00.430
the pressure of the gangs,
the pressure of drugs,

00:28:00.430 --> 00:28:02.080
the pressure of
the prostitution,

00:28:02.080 --> 00:28:05.140
the pressure of the
health risk, the pressure

00:28:05.140 --> 00:28:08.860
of just breathing some days.

00:28:08.860 --> 00:28:15.090
But with all of that, you're
exceptional, you're resilient,

00:28:15.090 --> 00:28:17.100
and you are
Brownsville's Brilliance.

00:28:17.100 --> 00:28:20.790
No one can ever deny that
or take that away from you.

00:28:20.790 --> 00:28:24.210
So don't see Brownsville as
this place that's negative.

00:28:24.210 --> 00:28:27.690
See it as a place that-- shows
you're a survivor, and not

00:28:27.690 --> 00:28:30.640
too many people can do that.

00:28:30.640 --> 00:28:32.650
The next time someone
tries to speak badly

00:28:32.650 --> 00:28:35.102
about where you come from,
tell them, come meet you there.

00:28:35.102 --> 00:28:36.310
I bet you they won't show up.

00:28:36.310 --> 00:28:37.810
[LAUGHTER]

00:28:37.810 --> 00:28:39.550
Right?

00:28:39.550 --> 00:28:42.310
Turn the negative into
something positive.

00:28:42.310 --> 00:28:47.800
I always tell them, my value
is because of Brownsville.

00:28:47.800 --> 00:28:52.500
If I worked in Park Slope--
no disrespect to Park Slope--

00:28:52.500 --> 00:28:54.660
no one ever comes up to
the Park Slope teacher

00:28:54.660 --> 00:28:59.640
and says, oh my God, wow,
you work in Park Slope?

00:28:59.640 --> 00:29:02.000
How do you do it?

00:29:02.000 --> 00:29:03.720
They don't say that.

00:29:03.720 --> 00:29:05.220
I say I work in Brownsville.

00:29:05.220 --> 00:29:07.800
It's like, oh, my god.

00:29:07.800 --> 00:29:09.730
How do you do it?

00:29:09.730 --> 00:29:12.150
God bless you.

00:29:12.150 --> 00:29:14.370
God should have blessed
me in either space.

00:29:14.370 --> 00:29:15.180
Right?

00:29:15.180 --> 00:29:21.980
But it's seen as, that's
not what I could do,

00:29:21.980 --> 00:29:25.240
so thank you for doing it--

00:29:25.240 --> 00:29:28.440
which is, kind of, good, because
I guilt people into helping me.

00:29:28.440 --> 00:29:30.219
So you won't come to
teach, but can you

00:29:30.219 --> 00:29:32.760
come to the school to talk to
the kids for two hours, though?

00:29:32.760 --> 00:29:33.840
Can we do that?

00:29:33.840 --> 00:29:35.220
Or can they come
visit your space

00:29:35.220 --> 00:29:37.380
so that they can see what
their opportunities are?

00:29:37.380 --> 00:29:39.990
And people will say, yes,
quicker than that, than to me

00:29:39.990 --> 00:29:41.780
saying, can you come
teach for a week?

00:29:41.780 --> 00:29:43.250
Uh, a week?

00:29:43.250 --> 00:29:44.060
What?

00:29:44.060 --> 00:29:46.770
Right?

00:29:46.770 --> 00:29:49.260
We also celebrate College
Week at our school.

00:29:49.260 --> 00:29:52.770
So many of our kids
are never going

00:29:52.770 --> 00:29:58.519
to understand how amazing
it is to go to college.

00:29:58.519 --> 00:30:00.810
They're never going to have
those conversations sitting

00:30:00.810 --> 00:30:02.209
at the kitchen table.

00:30:02.209 --> 00:30:03.750
They're never going
to know what it's

00:30:03.750 --> 00:30:05.179
like to go to alumni weekend.

00:30:05.179 --> 00:30:06.720
They're never going
to know what it's

00:30:06.720 --> 00:30:08.640
like to join a
sorority of fraternity

00:30:08.640 --> 00:30:12.540
or have those conversations
that usually are had when

00:30:12.540 --> 00:30:15.510
your parents' friends come over,
or your parent has that hat,

00:30:15.510 --> 00:30:17.730
or they're having a great
conversation about what

00:30:17.730 --> 00:30:20.400
it was like to go to school.

00:30:20.400 --> 00:30:23.170
So we have to do
it for our kids.

00:30:23.170 --> 00:30:27.600
There was a conversation with a
realtor who came to the school

00:30:27.600 --> 00:30:30.090
and said, how is it possible
that we could create all

00:30:30.090 --> 00:30:32.130
these great schools
in New York City,

00:30:32.130 --> 00:30:34.710
we give these kids everything
that they could possibly want,

00:30:34.710 --> 00:30:37.470
they get to college,
and then they drop out?

00:30:37.470 --> 00:30:39.730
And I asked him,
have you ever asked

00:30:39.730 --> 00:30:43.210
the kid who dropped out,
why they dropped out?

00:30:43.210 --> 00:30:45.490
Of course, he was silent.

00:30:45.490 --> 00:30:49.160
I said, it's called,
culture shock.

00:30:49.160 --> 00:30:51.560
Here's the thing
people don't tell us

00:30:51.560 --> 00:30:53.960
whose parents have
never gone to college--

00:30:53.960 --> 00:30:56.966
hey, you've got
to pay for books.

00:30:56.966 --> 00:30:58.590
If I've gone to public
school, my books

00:30:58.590 --> 00:31:01.690
have been given to
me every single year.

00:31:01.690 --> 00:31:06.440
Now, I have to pay,
like, $150 for a book?

00:31:06.440 --> 00:31:08.150
That if I got someone's
book last year,

00:31:08.150 --> 00:31:10.275
but it's now changed, so
these pages are different,

00:31:10.275 --> 00:31:13.530
so I can't even follow, so I've
really got to get the book?

00:31:13.530 --> 00:31:16.039
Has anybody told me that by
the time we get to November

00:31:16.039 --> 00:31:17.580
and it's midterms
and I'm going to be

00:31:17.580 --> 00:31:23.200
eating cold pizza and coffee
and soda to get through?

00:31:23.200 --> 00:31:26.320
However, if I've lived
under public assistance,

00:31:26.320 --> 00:31:27.329
we don't have--

00:31:27.329 --> 00:31:28.870
there's a different
way of surviving,

00:31:28.870 --> 00:31:30.360
and we don't drink that.

00:31:30.360 --> 00:31:33.030
We have, like, family
opportunities where we're

00:31:33.030 --> 00:31:34.800
eating different types of food.

00:31:34.800 --> 00:31:38.460
Do you ever think about that?

00:31:38.460 --> 00:31:42.250
Have you ever
thought that you're

00:31:42.250 --> 00:31:47.370
taking a child away from a
space where they feel included

00:31:47.370 --> 00:31:50.520
to get to another space
where they feel excluded,

00:31:50.520 --> 00:31:53.800
and no one ever
prepares them for that?

00:31:53.800 --> 00:31:56.240
And he looked at
me and said, no.

00:31:56.240 --> 00:31:59.480
Yeah, that's why,
oftentimes, kids drop out.

00:31:59.480 --> 00:32:02.920
But then money runs
out, or the education

00:32:02.920 --> 00:32:04.510
that they received
in high school

00:32:04.510 --> 00:32:08.380
was not on par with what they
needed to get through college.

00:32:08.380 --> 00:32:11.380
And so you take remedial classes
in college, the money runs out,

00:32:11.380 --> 00:32:12.890
and you can't continue on.

00:32:12.890 --> 00:32:14.350
I said there are
so many factors.

00:32:14.350 --> 00:32:16.845
Kids don't just
want to drop out.

00:32:16.845 --> 00:32:18.220
It's not what they
do waking up--

00:32:18.220 --> 00:32:21.030
I just want to drop out today.

00:32:21.030 --> 00:32:24.090
So he realized that there had
to be a different way of college

00:32:24.090 --> 00:32:26.852
and career readiness.

00:32:26.852 --> 00:32:28.310
And so when I
started my school, it

00:32:28.310 --> 00:32:31.010
was about needing to make sure
that kids know that teachers

00:32:31.010 --> 00:32:33.300
actually went to college.

00:32:33.300 --> 00:32:35.519
Because we never talk about
where we went to school.

00:32:35.519 --> 00:32:36.810
They go to the doctor's office.

00:32:36.810 --> 00:32:39.184
Doctor wants you to know that
they went to Johns Hopkins,

00:32:39.184 --> 00:32:41.400
they went to Columbia--
they put it up.

00:32:41.400 --> 00:32:42.170
Hello!

00:32:42.170 --> 00:32:43.120
And it's big, right?

00:32:43.120 --> 00:32:44.730
If you ever went to
a doctor's office,

00:32:44.730 --> 00:32:46.355
especially pediatrician,
they're making

00:32:46.355 --> 00:32:48.360
sure you know where they went.

00:32:48.360 --> 00:32:50.790
Same thing as a lawyer--
it's like a badge of honor

00:32:50.790 --> 00:32:53.160
to say which school you went to.

00:32:53.160 --> 00:32:54.660
You go into a teacher's space--

00:32:54.660 --> 00:32:56.820
there's nothing that
says we went to college.

00:32:56.820 --> 00:32:58.080
We went to college.

00:32:58.080 --> 00:32:59.850
Put your degrees up.

00:32:59.850 --> 00:33:00.720
Dust them off.

00:33:00.720 --> 00:33:02.250
Bring them in.

00:33:02.250 --> 00:33:03.044
Take pictures.

00:33:03.044 --> 00:33:04.710
If you were in a
sorority or fraternity,

00:33:04.710 --> 00:33:08.760
put them on your wall, and let's
have conversations around that.

00:33:08.760 --> 00:33:12.580
And then, wear
your paraphernalia,

00:33:12.580 --> 00:33:14.280
and just, like,
boast for the day.

00:33:14.280 --> 00:33:15.330
Like, yeah, I went
to this school.

00:33:15.330 --> 00:33:15.620
What?

00:33:15.620 --> 00:33:15.910
What?

00:33:15.910 --> 00:33:16.230
What?

00:33:16.230 --> 00:33:16.938
You want to come?

00:33:16.938 --> 00:33:17.910
You want to come?

00:33:17.910 --> 00:33:18.630
Right?

00:33:18.630 --> 00:33:20.990
And the kids are like, oh,
I want to go to that school.

00:33:20.990 --> 00:33:22.854
And how I get a
t-shirt like that?

00:33:22.854 --> 00:33:24.270
And that also
prepares us for when

00:33:24.270 --> 00:33:27.120
we go to places like
Harvard, or we go to Yale,

00:33:27.120 --> 00:33:29.760
or we go to Columbia, or
we go to City College,

00:33:29.760 --> 00:33:30.900
or we go to Vassar--

00:33:30.900 --> 00:33:32.760
that they're having
those experiences,

00:33:32.760 --> 00:33:35.700
and now they know what to ask,
because we start preparing them

00:33:35.700 --> 00:33:38.160
from sixth grade.

00:33:38.160 --> 00:33:43.300
Financial aid-- are there
support groups there?

00:33:43.300 --> 00:33:46.500
What's the
teacher-to-student ratio?

00:33:46.500 --> 00:33:49.980
We want them to be able to
understand the language, again,

00:33:49.980 --> 00:33:52.890
to navigate.

00:33:52.890 --> 00:33:55.860
Building literacy
skills-- we recognize

00:33:55.860 --> 00:33:58.140
that kids like to be
on their iPads and all

00:33:58.140 --> 00:34:00.630
this other great stuff,
so how do we make sure

00:34:00.630 --> 00:34:03.300
that we start to create an
opportunity where they can

00:34:03.300 --> 00:34:07.910
use technology and still read?

00:34:07.910 --> 00:34:10.610
Because our kids don't have
the opportunity of often going

00:34:10.610 --> 00:34:13.280
to the libraries, because
the libraries are embedded

00:34:13.280 --> 00:34:15.860
within the projects,
and the projects are

00:34:15.860 --> 00:34:18.780
segregated by gangs.

00:34:18.780 --> 00:34:22.650
And no one dared to think about
that, especially our boys.

00:34:22.650 --> 00:34:26.699
There are literally
streets they cannot cross,

00:34:26.699 --> 00:34:28.755
because they may
stand being killed.

00:34:31.639 --> 00:34:35.210
We use Google Hangout sessions
so that they can communicate

00:34:35.210 --> 00:34:40.420
with people around the world, or
even locally at their offices.

00:34:40.420 --> 00:34:43.030
So we try to use technology
where kids understand that it's

00:34:43.030 --> 00:34:46.389
not just for Facebook,
Instagram, or Snapchat

00:34:46.389 --> 00:34:50.110
where they're just doing
all of their craziness.

00:34:50.110 --> 00:34:51.920
But how can we engage
in good conversation?

00:34:51.920 --> 00:34:54.253
Hey, you can still dance while
you're on Google Hangout,

00:34:54.253 --> 00:34:58.310
but let's do it for something
positive and engaging.

00:34:58.310 --> 00:35:01.120
My teachers lead
professional development.

00:35:01.120 --> 00:35:03.760
They're the experts.

00:35:03.760 --> 00:35:05.536
Share what you know.

00:35:05.536 --> 00:35:10.000
Take the opportunity to
give to your colleagues.

00:35:10.000 --> 00:35:16.990
Develop a collaborative
community within yourselves.

00:35:16.990 --> 00:35:18.400
Now, because of
the money that we

00:35:18.400 --> 00:35:24.040
raise from Humans of New York,
we split the money three ways.

00:35:24.040 --> 00:35:26.920
Our scholars, in addition
to our legacy group--

00:35:26.920 --> 00:35:30.140
I had to create a legacy group,
because my graduates were like,

00:35:30.140 --> 00:35:33.310
wait a minute, wait a minute.

00:35:33.310 --> 00:35:35.650
We graduated before
this money came in.

00:35:35.650 --> 00:35:37.800
We want to go to college, too.

00:35:37.800 --> 00:35:40.660
Sure, we continue on the legacy
of them going to college,

00:35:40.660 --> 00:35:43.870
so I literally take them
on college tours and trips

00:35:43.870 --> 00:35:45.880
during February and
April, when we're

00:35:45.880 --> 00:35:48.160
supposed to be on spring
break and mid-winter break.

00:35:48.160 --> 00:35:52.440
And then, they come in
once a month for check-ins,

00:35:52.440 --> 00:35:54.190
but they're usually
there once a week just

00:35:54.190 --> 00:35:55.900
to come into the
building to have a place

00:35:55.900 --> 00:35:57.970
to study and hang out.

00:35:57.970 --> 00:36:01.720
But we do the college trips.

00:36:01.720 --> 00:36:03.910
We also do a summer
steam, because the kids

00:36:03.910 --> 00:36:05.071
are so far behind.

00:36:05.071 --> 00:36:06.820
We want to make sure
that they're actively

00:36:06.820 --> 00:36:08.360
working and learning.

00:36:08.360 --> 00:36:12.460
So for five weeks, 8:30 to 3
o'clock, Monday through Friday,

00:36:12.460 --> 00:36:14.830
the scholars are in classes.

00:36:14.830 --> 00:36:16.809
They're not your
typical boring classes--

00:36:16.809 --> 00:36:18.850
not to say that my teachers
teach boring classes,

00:36:18.850 --> 00:36:21.790
but the reality is that there
are high-stakes exams that they

00:36:21.790 --> 00:36:23.530
always have to get
prepared for, that

00:36:23.530 --> 00:36:26.920
deprives them of what really
teaching is about and learning

00:36:26.920 --> 00:36:27.480
is about.

00:36:27.480 --> 00:36:27.700
Right?

00:36:27.700 --> 00:36:29.230
So we try to create a balance.

00:36:29.230 --> 00:36:32.410
By summertime, it's the
most amazing classes

00:36:32.410 --> 00:36:33.770
that you can imagine.

00:36:33.770 --> 00:36:36.820
So our sixth graders last
year learned horticulture

00:36:36.820 --> 00:36:38.650
in urban settings.

00:36:38.650 --> 00:36:41.140
Because I explained to you--

00:36:41.140 --> 00:36:43.400
highest risk of health issues.

00:36:43.400 --> 00:36:45.400
So they need to understand
the importance of why

00:36:45.400 --> 00:36:46.990
we have a community garden.

00:36:46.990 --> 00:36:50.110
They need to understand why
you have to have healthy eating

00:36:50.110 --> 00:36:54.090
habits, and how that needs to
turnkey to their family members

00:36:54.090 --> 00:36:56.070
and the community at large.

00:36:56.070 --> 00:36:58.860
So they actually present
their information.

00:36:58.860 --> 00:37:01.470
They actually plant
in the garden.

00:37:01.470 --> 00:37:05.070
Our seventh graders
learn social justice

00:37:05.070 --> 00:37:07.530
through the analysis
of Black Lives Matter--

00:37:07.530 --> 00:37:10.890
not just Black Lives
Matter 2016, 2017,

00:37:10.890 --> 00:37:13.320
but since slavery up until now.

00:37:13.320 --> 00:37:14.430
What has gone on?

00:37:14.430 --> 00:37:16.530
Why does history continue
to repeat itself?

00:37:16.530 --> 00:37:25.720
And how do you engage in
understanding to protest,

00:37:25.720 --> 00:37:30.447
but making sure your protest
is in a way that is nonviolent,

00:37:30.447 --> 00:37:32.280
that is cohesive, that
people can understand

00:37:32.280 --> 00:37:35.220
what your ask is going to be?

00:37:35.220 --> 00:37:37.770
And how do you galvanize
everyone around you

00:37:37.770 --> 00:37:40.350
to support what you're saying?

00:37:40.350 --> 00:37:43.680
So we have partnered with
the US attorney's office.

00:37:43.680 --> 00:37:46.410
Our scholars got to see
and speak to judges,

00:37:46.410 --> 00:37:48.782
look at trials, and
then do a presentation

00:37:48.782 --> 00:37:51.240
and create their own magazine
about some of the issues that

00:37:51.240 --> 00:37:55.950
are happening in their community
as their way of demonstrating

00:37:55.950 --> 00:37:58.700
social justice.

00:37:58.700 --> 00:38:02.010
Our eighth graders get
prepared for the high school

00:38:02.010 --> 00:38:03.750
exam as well as regents.

00:38:03.750 --> 00:38:05.509
So my eighth graders
have the opportunity

00:38:05.509 --> 00:38:07.050
of taking the math
regents, because I

00:38:07.050 --> 00:38:10.134
need them to be ahead by the
time they get into high school,

00:38:10.134 --> 00:38:11.550
so that instead
of taking algebra,

00:38:11.550 --> 00:38:12.840
they can take geometry.

00:38:12.840 --> 00:38:14.850
Because a lot of
them are behind,

00:38:14.850 --> 00:38:18.120
because they're over-aged.

00:38:18.120 --> 00:38:20.717
Our scholarly discussions--
which is important.

00:38:20.717 --> 00:38:22.800
They need to understand
how to present themselves.

00:38:22.800 --> 00:38:25.410
They need to have real
working skills, in terms of,

00:38:25.410 --> 00:38:28.000
this is what we do when
we are in real life.

00:38:28.000 --> 00:38:32.070
You get up, you
talk, and you share.

00:38:32.070 --> 00:38:35.010
Expanding horizons-- we
have a lot of partnerships

00:38:35.010 --> 00:38:36.450
with amazing individuals.

00:38:36.450 --> 00:38:38.890
So this is actually the
wife of Brandon Stanton

00:38:38.890 --> 00:38:42.300
of Humans of New York, Erin.

00:38:42.300 --> 00:38:45.597
She has a-- if you go on
Instagram or Facebook,

00:38:45.597 --> 00:38:46.680
it's called Susie the Dog.

00:38:46.680 --> 00:38:50.640
She rescues a lot of
over-aged animals or animals

00:38:50.640 --> 00:38:53.460
who are going to be euthanized,
and try to get them homes.

00:38:53.460 --> 00:38:55.950
So she's really into
veterinarian science,

00:38:55.950 --> 00:38:58.560
and teaching children
to love and ways

00:38:58.560 --> 00:39:00.600
of being humane to animals.

00:39:00.600 --> 00:39:02.550
She runs a program
out of our school.

00:39:02.550 --> 00:39:05.610
Our kids get to go
to the canine unit.

00:39:05.610 --> 00:39:08.180
They've gone to an
overnight disability farm,

00:39:08.180 --> 00:39:10.550
so they actually stayed
upstate New York to look

00:39:10.550 --> 00:39:14.000
at animals who are disabled.

00:39:14.000 --> 00:39:15.650
Talk about being
empathetic, not only

00:39:15.650 --> 00:39:18.150
to people, children who have
special needs in your children,

00:39:18.150 --> 00:39:21.200
but look at what happens
to animals as well.

00:39:21.200 --> 00:39:23.270
So they get to see
that, and now, you

00:39:23.270 --> 00:39:25.640
have so many of my kids who
want to become veterinarian

00:39:25.640 --> 00:39:27.770
scientists.

00:39:27.770 --> 00:39:31.070
Because of it, I now have
networking opportunities

00:39:31.070 --> 00:39:33.110
and partnering with St.
George's University--

00:39:33.110 --> 00:39:36.080
that's in Grenada-- which
allows my kids, one day,

00:39:36.080 --> 00:39:39.725
to go to that school to
study veterinarian science.

00:39:42.240 --> 00:39:44.610
And those kids who are from
Grenada, whose parents are

00:39:44.610 --> 00:39:48.454
from Grenada, would have
guaranteed seats, in terms of,

00:39:48.454 --> 00:39:49.995
they don't have to
pay the high cost.

00:39:52.620 --> 00:39:55.710
They see it as an investment
creating a pipeline

00:39:55.710 --> 00:39:58.530
and understanding that education
is beyond the reach of just

00:39:58.530 --> 00:40:01.290
one immediate community.

00:40:01.290 --> 00:40:03.000
Digital Day-- I love this day.

00:40:03.000 --> 00:40:04.500
We shut down the
day of the school,

00:40:04.500 --> 00:40:08.880
and we bring in people from all
types of digital tech spaces.

00:40:08.880 --> 00:40:10.800
Because there are
too many buzzwords

00:40:10.800 --> 00:40:13.670
that go around-- tech,
digital, tech, digital.

00:40:13.670 --> 00:40:14.970
I'm a principal.

00:40:14.970 --> 00:40:17.220
I would love to know what
everybody in this room does,

00:40:17.220 --> 00:40:20.040
but I don't know what you do.

00:40:20.040 --> 00:40:24.000
So I need you to come and
tell my kids what you do,

00:40:24.000 --> 00:40:27.270
so that they can say,
maybe I can do that, too.

00:40:27.270 --> 00:40:29.790
They only become what they see--

00:40:29.790 --> 00:40:32.840
teachers, doctors, lawyers.

00:40:32.840 --> 00:40:35.300
Maybe they want to
be a police officer,

00:40:35.300 --> 00:40:38.090
but they don't subscribe to say,
I want to be in tech spaces,

00:40:38.090 --> 00:40:39.740
or I want to work from Google.

00:40:39.740 --> 00:40:43.160
Outside of just Google
me, know that there's

00:40:43.160 --> 00:40:45.080
somebody behind that.

00:40:45.080 --> 00:40:47.840
There are people working
in amazing spaces

00:40:47.840 --> 00:40:50.450
that you need to be in.

00:40:50.450 --> 00:40:53.720
We have guest speakers, people
who come in, like I told you.

00:40:53.720 --> 00:40:55.340
Everyone that you
see are my friends

00:40:55.340 --> 00:40:56.630
or I found them on
Twitter, and was like,

00:40:56.630 --> 00:40:58.010
hey, I've been following you.

00:40:58.010 --> 00:41:00.260
Can you come to the school?

00:41:00.260 --> 00:41:01.640
Great thing about social media.

00:41:04.900 --> 00:41:07.515
We have mentorship and
career exploration.

00:41:07.515 --> 00:41:09.640
New York Times would never
write a positive article

00:41:09.640 --> 00:41:11.140
about Brownsville.

00:41:11.140 --> 00:41:14.129
I was getting so tired of doing
Google Brownsville and this is

00:41:14.129 --> 00:41:14.920
what will come up--

00:41:14.920 --> 00:41:16.240
everything negative.

00:41:16.240 --> 00:41:18.910
And I said, the only way you
can combat something negative

00:41:18.910 --> 00:41:21.490
is by creating
your own narrative.

00:41:21.490 --> 00:41:25.870
So my friend, Syreeta Gates, who
has done a lot of amazing work

00:41:25.870 --> 00:41:29.380
with a lot of publications,
helped my scholars

00:41:29.380 --> 00:41:31.570
to develop their own magazine.

00:41:31.570 --> 00:41:33.310
So she mentored them.

00:41:33.310 --> 00:41:35.830
She explained to them
the different facets

00:41:35.830 --> 00:41:38.500
of what makes them magazine.

00:41:38.500 --> 00:41:41.810
And then, we created an online
magazine called, "The Score"--

00:41:41.810 --> 00:41:45.230
68 pages, brilliant, pictures.

00:41:45.230 --> 00:41:46.330
It was beautiful.

00:41:46.330 --> 00:41:49.930
You can actually go
online, you can Google it,

00:41:49.930 --> 00:41:51.560
and it will come up--

00:41:51.560 --> 00:41:56.710
created by scholars about their
community in a positive light.

00:41:56.710 --> 00:41:59.830
And because of this, when
the New York Times writer

00:41:59.830 --> 00:42:02.890
came to our school, she saw
it, and she saw alongside it

00:42:02.890 --> 00:42:05.950
an article that was written
by one of her counterparts.

00:42:05.950 --> 00:42:08.350
And she says, why do
you have a magazine?

00:42:08.350 --> 00:42:11.570
I said, because you keep
writing the wrong things.

00:42:11.570 --> 00:42:14.790
So if I don't see it,
I have to create it.

00:42:14.790 --> 00:42:17.100
She took it back to
her editor-in-chief,

00:42:17.100 --> 00:42:20.640
and as a result, they did
a feature on our school.

00:42:20.640 --> 00:42:24.372
December 15, 2014--
before Humans of New York.

00:42:24.372 --> 00:42:25.830
It was the first
time they had ever

00:42:25.830 --> 00:42:31.070
published something positive
about a community collectedly.

00:42:31.070 --> 00:42:33.206
We do our young men
empowerment summit.

00:42:33.206 --> 00:42:34.580
We do it for young
women as well,

00:42:34.580 --> 00:42:36.538
but it's something powerful
about our young men

00:42:36.538 --> 00:42:39.590
of color, knowing that they
matter each and every day.

00:42:39.590 --> 00:42:41.600
So we have a mantra
for them to say,

00:42:41.600 --> 00:42:45.350
because the media does not
remind them that they matter.

00:42:45.350 --> 00:42:47.240
We did this before
Black Lives Matter.

00:42:47.240 --> 00:42:53.804
We did this before
President Obama had--

00:42:53.804 --> 00:42:55.220
what was it-- my
brother's keeper.

00:42:55.220 --> 00:42:56.678
We used to have
that in our school,

00:42:56.678 --> 00:42:58.280
and it was not successful.

00:42:58.280 --> 00:43:00.920
The minute we changed it,
and we wanted our boys

00:43:00.920 --> 00:43:04.550
to affirm to themselves that
they have value in this world,

00:43:04.550 --> 00:43:07.120
that people will be
willing to invest in them

00:43:07.120 --> 00:43:09.410
and come and speak
to them, we ended up

00:43:09.410 --> 00:43:12.680
with 250 to 300 young
men as part of a cohort.

00:43:12.680 --> 00:43:15.630
They go through five
distinct classes per year.

00:43:18.500 --> 00:43:22.010
21st-century college
career readiness--

00:43:22.010 --> 00:43:23.750
they learn coding,
they learn web design,

00:43:23.750 --> 00:43:26.920
and they learn music production.

00:43:26.920 --> 00:43:29.780
My scholars have
culinary art classes.

00:43:29.780 --> 00:43:32.270
They have photography.

00:43:32.270 --> 00:43:36.470
They also have lab rats where
they get to dissect animals.

00:43:36.470 --> 00:43:39.100
They have chess.

00:43:39.100 --> 00:43:41.300
I told you, I lose
a lot of money.

00:43:41.300 --> 00:43:45.160
But I make a lot of good friends
If I don't know anything else,

00:43:45.160 --> 00:43:48.970
having relationships
is like capital.

00:43:48.970 --> 00:43:53.510
Your network becomes
your net worth.

00:43:53.510 --> 00:43:56.720
98% Graduation rate
for a community

00:43:56.720 --> 00:44:00.140
where children have been known
to see their family members not

00:44:00.140 --> 00:44:03.420
make it through high school--

00:44:03.420 --> 00:44:06.300
and here we are,
building a legacy.

00:44:06.300 --> 00:44:08.130
So these are my
graduates-- some of them.

00:44:08.130 --> 00:44:12.360
We were at Columbia University.

00:44:12.360 --> 00:44:14.460
These are the proud moments.

00:44:14.460 --> 00:44:18.270
These are the reasons
why you create a space

00:44:18.270 --> 00:44:22.050
in which children are happy.

00:44:22.050 --> 00:44:24.360
The one great thing
about visiting your space

00:44:24.360 --> 00:44:29.830
is that I get inspired to see
people happy to be at work,

00:44:29.830 --> 00:44:33.170
to have choices and opportunity.

00:44:33.170 --> 00:44:35.030
I want my kids to
see that despite what

00:44:35.030 --> 00:44:37.490
they see every single day in
Brownsville that tells them

00:44:37.490 --> 00:44:39.970
what they can't do.

00:44:39.970 --> 00:44:42.610
I want them to know
that they can and will

00:44:42.610 --> 00:44:44.870
take over this world.

00:44:44.870 --> 00:44:47.920
I want them to also know
that when they receive,

00:44:47.920 --> 00:44:49.090
they have to give back.

00:44:49.090 --> 00:44:51.130
Because the only way to
transform your community

00:44:51.130 --> 00:44:53.650
is not by getting
and then leaving,

00:44:53.650 --> 00:44:57.490
but you actually have to come
back and set your own legacy

00:44:57.490 --> 00:45:01.540
to impact the next generation.

00:45:01.540 --> 00:45:03.100
I am blessed.

00:45:03.100 --> 00:45:06.340
I started off by explaining
to you that I was in Dubai,

00:45:06.340 --> 00:45:08.110
and also the fact
that I was able to be

00:45:08.110 --> 00:45:10.270
in a space that has been
impacted by what someone

00:45:10.270 --> 00:45:13.720
saw here in Google.

00:45:13.720 --> 00:45:17.040
But it's because of the
brilliance of my scholars.

00:45:17.040 --> 00:45:19.740
It's because of the success
that we were able to achieve.

00:45:19.740 --> 00:45:21.880
It's because we
created this space that

00:45:21.880 --> 00:45:25.390
allows them to be happy
that they are actually

00:45:25.390 --> 00:45:31.570
able to live this amazing life
while they're in my building.

00:45:31.570 --> 00:45:34.480
So I know I've
spoken a lot, and I

00:45:34.480 --> 00:45:36.940
don't want to end without
people going to the mic.

00:45:36.940 --> 00:45:38.590
But I'm going to close it out.

00:45:38.590 --> 00:45:41.200
If you have any questions, you
can definitely go to the mics

00:45:41.200 --> 00:45:42.070
now.

00:45:42.070 --> 00:45:43.820
I don't want people
to be shy and saying,

00:45:43.820 --> 00:45:46.524
no, I don't have anything,
and then as I'm leaving,

00:45:46.524 --> 00:45:48.940
people are gonna be like, so
what you said was so amazing.

00:45:48.940 --> 00:45:51.230
[LAUGHTER]

00:45:51.230 --> 00:45:53.080
So I just wanted to ask
you-- because that's

00:45:53.080 --> 00:45:54.726
what happens all the time.

00:45:54.726 --> 00:45:57.100
Someone in this room probably
needs to hear that question

00:45:57.100 --> 00:45:58.580
or would ask me
the same question,

00:45:58.580 --> 00:46:01.690
so don't be afraid
to come to the mic.

00:46:01.690 --> 00:46:06.850
But no, you've inspired me,
and I thank you for that.

00:46:06.850 --> 00:46:08.800
So I'm going to take
you on this side,

00:46:08.800 --> 00:46:10.150
and then you on that side.

00:46:10.150 --> 00:46:10.810
Yes.

00:46:10.810 --> 00:46:12.840
AUDIENCE: So I live in Brooklyn.

00:46:12.840 --> 00:46:14.730
Actually, in Fort
Greene, [INAUDIBLE]

00:46:14.730 --> 00:46:18.820
Hill, the very quickly
gentrifying neighborhood

00:46:18.820 --> 00:46:22.990
where houses are
millions of dollars now.

00:46:22.990 --> 00:46:25.660
And the school that's
my neighborhood school

00:46:25.660 --> 00:46:29.440
is a school where the principal
has berated the teachers.

00:46:29.440 --> 00:46:33.010
And so now, I would love
to be the person that

00:46:33.010 --> 00:46:34.450
helps to turn
around that school,

00:46:34.450 --> 00:46:38.140
but that is such
a daunting task.

00:46:38.140 --> 00:46:41.500
And I feel super guilty about
it, but now, I've opted out.

00:46:41.500 --> 00:46:45.130
And I would love to
hear, what can we do?

00:46:45.130 --> 00:46:47.320
What can I do, and
what is possible to do

00:46:47.320 --> 00:46:52.210
within this really ridiculously
complicated and totally unequal

00:46:52.210 --> 00:46:54.820
system of resources of people?

00:46:54.820 --> 00:46:57.010
And where can we get
more people like you

00:46:57.010 --> 00:46:59.560
to take the place of
principals that berate teachers

00:46:59.560 --> 00:47:02.260
and an administration that
doesn't feel like they

00:47:02.260 --> 00:47:03.064
want to engage.

00:47:03.064 --> 00:47:04.480
NADIA LOPEZ: So
ironically enough,

00:47:04.480 --> 00:47:08.986
my teaching experience
started in Fort Greene.

00:47:08.986 --> 00:47:10.360
And that's why I
know that that's

00:47:10.360 --> 00:47:14.440
a place where people have been
allowed to demean children.

00:47:14.440 --> 00:47:15.670
So it starts with leadership.

00:47:15.670 --> 00:47:15.880
Right?

00:47:15.880 --> 00:47:17.950
Leadership sets the tone,
and it was the leader.

00:47:17.950 --> 00:47:20.730
And then, there were
just people who, I feel,

00:47:20.730 --> 00:47:24.910
were the little cronies who
felt like the only way we can

00:47:24.910 --> 00:47:27.490
survive is to be the same way.

00:47:27.490 --> 00:47:30.840
And it was so toxic.

00:47:30.840 --> 00:47:33.280
So I'm going to tell you
that after three years,

00:47:33.280 --> 00:47:34.600
I had to leave.

00:47:34.600 --> 00:47:36.220
I wanted to leave
the first year,

00:47:36.220 --> 00:47:38.260
but it was before
they made changes

00:47:38.260 --> 00:47:39.370
that allowed us to leave.

00:47:39.370 --> 00:47:42.160
Like, we literally
were held captive,

00:47:42.160 --> 00:47:47.590
and it required the chancellor
to let you leave the school.

00:47:47.590 --> 00:47:52.970
As a parent, as a
community, and as a person

00:47:52.970 --> 00:47:57.130
who lives in the community,
you can share your concerns

00:47:57.130 --> 00:47:58.630
with the superintendent.

00:47:58.630 --> 00:48:03.550
You can share your
concerns by calling 311.

00:48:03.550 --> 00:48:06.520
Part of it is, if they
don't know what's going on,

00:48:06.520 --> 00:48:08.440
nothing will ever change.

00:48:08.440 --> 00:48:10.750
I feel like as a
principal, I hold myself

00:48:10.750 --> 00:48:11.740
to the highest regard.

00:48:11.740 --> 00:48:16.990
Sometimes, it's to a detriment,
because if a paper didn't

00:48:16.990 --> 00:48:19.320
go home on Monday, and
it ends up on Tuesday,

00:48:19.320 --> 00:48:21.070
parents are like, we
didn't get the paper.

00:48:21.070 --> 00:48:22.070
We didn't get the paper.

00:48:22.070 --> 00:48:23.350
And I'm like, it's a paper.

00:48:23.350 --> 00:48:24.250
Right?

00:48:24.250 --> 00:48:26.110
But in other schools,
if it's something

00:48:26.110 --> 00:48:29.400
like kids feeling like
they've been demoralized,

00:48:29.400 --> 00:48:30.775
they've been shut
out of classes,

00:48:30.775 --> 00:48:34.060
and they've been thrown out of
classes, they don't speak up.

00:48:34.060 --> 00:48:35.830
And it's often because
of the retaliation

00:48:35.830 --> 00:48:38.410
that they feel is going to come.

00:48:38.410 --> 00:48:43.150
But you on the outside
can speak to that.

00:48:43.150 --> 00:48:45.580
There's always someone
willing to listen.

00:48:45.580 --> 00:48:49.000
It has to start with actually
telling and making that call.

00:48:49.000 --> 00:48:54.790
So the options are,
311 and superintendent.

00:48:54.790 --> 00:48:57.312
Those are your best options,
because anything else is not

00:48:57.312 --> 00:48:58.270
going to make a change.

00:48:58.270 --> 00:48:59.350
You're not going to
go into the school.

00:48:59.350 --> 00:49:01.660
The principal's not
going to listen to you.

00:49:01.660 --> 00:49:04.237
But those people hold
them accountable.

00:49:04.237 --> 00:49:05.570
SPEAKER: Can I do one follow-up?

00:49:05.570 --> 00:49:06.278
NADIA LOPEZ: Yes.

00:49:06.278 --> 00:49:09.110
SPEAKER: What if it's been
published in "The Daily News,"

00:49:09.110 --> 00:49:10.790
and still, nothing's happened?

00:49:10.790 --> 00:49:12.940
NADIA LOPEZ: So you
continue to follow up.

00:49:12.940 --> 00:49:15.590
It comes down to--

00:49:15.590 --> 00:49:18.110
it could be in "The Daily
News," but "The Daily News" just

00:49:18.110 --> 00:49:20.960
sometimes falls on deaf ears.

00:49:20.960 --> 00:49:22.880
You have to be relentless.

00:49:22.880 --> 00:49:25.130
If you're not relentless--

00:49:25.130 --> 00:49:27.601
there are so many things
that happen in our society.

00:49:27.601 --> 00:49:28.100
Right?

00:49:28.100 --> 00:49:30.350
It gets published,
and nothing changes,

00:49:30.350 --> 00:49:33.980
until people get up and start
saying this is unacceptable,

00:49:33.980 --> 00:49:35.720
or going to the
community board meetings

00:49:35.720 --> 00:49:38.900
and saying this is unacceptable,
or getting a group of parents

00:49:38.900 --> 00:49:42.140
and creating a petition and
saying this is unacceptable.

00:49:42.140 --> 00:49:46.310
You have to continue to be that
person who's going to advocate.

00:49:46.310 --> 00:49:48.500
It doesn't require
100 people to do it,

00:49:48.500 --> 00:49:50.780
but if two or three
people consistently do it,

00:49:50.780 --> 00:49:53.270
someone is going to have to
say, there are people watching,

00:49:53.270 --> 00:49:55.790
and we need to pay attention
to what's going on.

00:49:55.790 --> 00:49:58.550
AUDIENCE: My question is,
with all the statistics

00:49:58.550 --> 00:50:01.100
that you laid out
for Brownsville,

00:50:01.100 --> 00:50:06.890
how do you justify or explain
teachers who have little

00:50:06.890 --> 00:50:11.240
to no experience coming
into these communities

00:50:11.240 --> 00:50:16.760
where 60-some-odd percent
have learning challenges

00:50:16.760 --> 00:50:18.830
that a teacher with
little to no experience

00:50:18.830 --> 00:50:21.050
wouldn't have been
exposed to, let

00:50:21.050 --> 00:50:24.050
alone the cultural
differences and just all

00:50:24.050 --> 00:50:26.210
of those challenges
that go into it?

00:50:26.210 --> 00:50:27.950
From my point of
view, I feel like you

00:50:27.950 --> 00:50:31.340
need experience and, sort
of, to be wet behind the ears

00:50:31.340 --> 00:50:37.040
before you can identify that
maybe a child is being abused

00:50:37.040 --> 00:50:44.000
in some way, or see some sort
of mental or learning challenge.

00:50:44.000 --> 00:50:46.910
And some of that, no matter how
much school experience you get,

00:50:46.910 --> 00:50:49.220
you only get from experience.

00:50:49.220 --> 00:50:52.340
NADIA LOPEZ: So
couple of things--

00:50:52.340 --> 00:50:54.920
veteran teachers are expensive.

00:50:54.920 --> 00:50:59.720
So I would love to have a
gang load of veteran teachers,

00:50:59.720 --> 00:51:02.750
but what they make,
their average,

00:51:02.750 --> 00:51:04.370
would eat up my budget.

00:51:04.370 --> 00:51:08.570
So when I'm a
smaller school, when

00:51:08.570 --> 00:51:12.440
I'm in a position where I have
to rationalize or ration off

00:51:12.440 --> 00:51:16.970
the money, I sit and I say,
how much money do I have.

00:51:16.970 --> 00:51:21.140
One veteran teacher could
be the cost of two teachers,

00:51:21.140 --> 00:51:23.390
because that's how much
they stand to make.

00:51:23.390 --> 00:51:26.520
A veteran teacher-- for
some of them, it's $75,000.

00:51:26.520 --> 00:51:29.360
For others, it's $125,000.

00:51:29.360 --> 00:51:31.610
They range.

00:51:31.610 --> 00:51:35.060
So I can't afford to have
as many veteran teachers

00:51:35.060 --> 00:51:36.680
in the building.

00:51:36.680 --> 00:51:37.760
That's one.

00:51:37.760 --> 00:51:39.770
The second thing
that becomes an issue

00:51:39.770 --> 00:51:44.510
is, people don't want
to work in those areas

00:51:44.510 --> 00:51:46.310
because it's a challenge.

00:51:46.310 --> 00:51:48.920
It requires a lot of energy.

00:51:48.920 --> 00:51:51.560
If you are a parent yourself
and you have a child,

00:51:51.560 --> 00:51:56.450
your thought process is, can I
sacrifice the time and energy

00:51:56.450 --> 00:51:58.880
that's required to
do this, that's going

00:51:58.880 --> 00:52:00.680
to take away from my child?

00:52:00.680 --> 00:52:05.100
And that's something people
have to ask for themselves.

00:52:05.100 --> 00:52:07.460
The other thing is, you have
a lot of teaching programs

00:52:07.460 --> 00:52:10.526
that are targeted
to giving us what's

00:52:10.526 --> 00:52:11.900
considered the
best and brightest

00:52:11.900 --> 00:52:13.500
to go into these spaces.

00:52:13.500 --> 00:52:15.446
But what they're learning
in the schools that

00:52:15.446 --> 00:52:16.820
are supposed to
be preparing them

00:52:16.820 --> 00:52:18.278
has nothing to do
with what they're

00:52:18.278 --> 00:52:21.590
going to face in the schools
that they're going to.

00:52:21.590 --> 00:52:24.440
So I have taken on
the daunting task

00:52:24.440 --> 00:52:28.880
of bringing in those
teaching prep programs

00:52:28.880 --> 00:52:32.420
and having those candidates
come and train at my school,

00:52:32.420 --> 00:52:34.884
because I really need them
to understand what's going

00:52:34.884 --> 00:52:36.050
to happen when they walk in.

00:52:36.050 --> 00:52:38.990
And I'm always in the
classrooms, always supporting,

00:52:38.990 --> 00:52:42.240
but I know what it's like,
because I was a teaching

00:52:42.240 --> 00:52:43.080
fellow.

00:52:43.080 --> 00:52:45.030
My first year, I
was not prepared.

00:52:45.030 --> 00:52:46.980
In my first year, for
the first three months,

00:52:46.980 --> 00:52:49.560
I cried every day like, I
want to go back to corporate.

00:52:49.560 --> 00:52:51.210
Why did I do this?

00:52:51.210 --> 00:52:52.680
Even though I'm
from Brooklyn, even

00:52:52.680 --> 00:52:54.971
though I was born and raised
around folks who were poor

00:52:54.971 --> 00:52:57.780
and we were struggling,
being in a classroom

00:52:57.780 --> 00:53:00.310
is a different dynamic.

00:53:00.310 --> 00:53:02.746
What sustained me was my faith.

00:53:02.746 --> 00:53:04.120
What sustained me
was that I knew

00:53:04.120 --> 00:53:06.550
someone had done it for me.

00:53:06.550 --> 00:53:09.680
And I had a child, so I
was going to figure it out.

00:53:09.680 --> 00:53:11.740
And what I saw was an injustice.

00:53:11.740 --> 00:53:13.930
Everyone is not built that way.

00:53:13.930 --> 00:53:19.450
So part of it is, no one is
asking the principals what

00:53:19.450 --> 00:53:20.860
the challenge is.

00:53:20.860 --> 00:53:23.890
They keep giving us
whatever they give us.

00:53:23.890 --> 00:53:25.690
People who keep
showing up are the ones

00:53:25.690 --> 00:53:29.830
who aren't the veteran
teachers, and so we're, kind of,

00:53:29.830 --> 00:53:34.480
called to task to make things
work in a short amount of time.

00:53:34.480 --> 00:53:36.220
Because when you
think about it, kids

00:53:36.220 --> 00:53:39.500
are only in school for
30 weeks out of the year.

00:53:39.500 --> 00:53:41.440
So it's systemic.

00:53:41.440 --> 00:53:45.160
It's not going to
be fixed overnight.

00:53:45.160 --> 00:53:46.540
But because of
people like me who

00:53:46.540 --> 00:53:49.650
are in the system, who are,
like, oh, this person--

00:53:49.650 --> 00:53:53.050
we've got to fix this and
we've got to work with them--

00:53:53.050 --> 00:53:56.110
it helps, but there's
not enough of me.

00:53:56.110 --> 00:53:57.580
There are really
great principals

00:53:57.580 --> 00:54:00.160
who are trying to do it,
but there's not enough.

00:54:00.160 --> 00:54:02.191
Because at the end of
the day, it's like,

00:54:02.191 --> 00:54:03.940
you have so much on
your plate that you're

00:54:03.940 --> 00:54:08.300
trying to get through, that
that just doesn't become

00:54:08.300 --> 00:54:11.364
a fight that you have anymore.

00:54:11.364 --> 00:54:12.270
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:54:12.270 --> 00:54:15.719
NADIA LOPEZ: You're welcome

00:54:15.719 --> 00:54:17.510
AUDIENCE: Hey, I just
had a quick question.

00:54:17.510 --> 00:54:20.720
You mentioned you kept your
school open till 9:00 or 10:00

00:54:20.720 --> 00:54:23.210
at night sometimes.

00:54:23.210 --> 00:54:25.760
So my kids after school,
they do the basketball.

00:54:25.760 --> 00:54:27.410
They got lots of
dads to coach that.

00:54:27.410 --> 00:54:29.150
I ran a computer
club for my kids--

00:54:29.150 --> 00:54:30.560
all that kind of stuff.

00:54:30.560 --> 00:54:32.780
What do your kids do
at the school for--

00:54:32.780 --> 00:54:36.140
I'm guessing-- like,
five hours afterwards?

00:54:36.140 --> 00:54:38.545
NADIA LOPEZ: They're
getting tutorial services.

00:54:38.545 --> 00:54:41.850
They're doing culinary arts.

00:54:41.850 --> 00:54:43.310
They're doing basketball.

00:54:43.310 --> 00:54:49.028
They're doing softball,
track, double dutch step,

00:54:49.028 --> 00:54:51.200
and clothing design.

00:54:51.200 --> 00:54:52.370
We have a program.

00:54:52.370 --> 00:54:53.890
So it's not them
just hanging out.

00:54:53.890 --> 00:54:56.330
It's actually a
structured program

00:54:56.330 --> 00:55:01.610
through SONYC, which
is what the mayor put

00:55:01.610 --> 00:55:04.740
as part of his initiative
for at-risk middle schools.

00:55:04.740 --> 00:55:08.450
We have funding in place,
where they pay them directly,

00:55:08.450 --> 00:55:09.494
to have these programs.

00:55:09.494 --> 00:55:10.910
But if I didn't
have that, there's

00:55:10.910 --> 00:55:15.130
also a BEACON program that
stays until 9:00 at night.

00:55:15.130 --> 00:55:19.070
AUDIENCE: So it's, kind
of, like a hired program,

00:55:19.070 --> 00:55:20.580
or is it parent
volunteers mostly?

00:55:20.580 --> 00:55:21.996
NADIA LOPEZ: It's
a hired program.

00:55:21.996 --> 00:55:24.020
We don't have parent volunteers.

00:55:24.020 --> 00:55:27.470
And oftentimes, it goes back
to parents' limitations,

00:55:27.470 --> 00:55:29.990
parents being comfortable,
and having something

00:55:29.990 --> 00:55:31.707
to contribute on that level.

00:55:31.707 --> 00:55:33.290
That's often at
times, but if a parent

00:55:33.290 --> 00:55:35.581
has something that they could
contribute, by all means,

00:55:35.581 --> 00:55:36.980
we accept them.

00:55:36.980 --> 00:55:39.815
But the reality is that we
don't have that in our building.

00:55:39.815 --> 00:55:41.210
AUDIENCE: No, it's fantastic
that you can do it.

00:55:41.210 --> 00:55:41.810
Thank you.

00:55:41.810 --> 00:55:43.640
NADIA LOPEZ: Thank you.

00:55:43.640 --> 00:55:45.452
Anyone else?

00:55:45.452 --> 00:55:46.910
AUDIENCE: I know
we're wrapping up,

00:55:46.910 --> 00:55:49.190
but just to leave us with
what we can do-- what can we

00:55:49.190 --> 00:55:51.280
all do from Google to help?

00:55:51.280 --> 00:55:54.080
NADIA LOPEZ: So that's
always a great question.

00:55:54.080 --> 00:55:55.850
A couple of things--

00:55:55.850 --> 00:56:00.360
I always open my doors and
say, my kids need to see you.

00:56:00.360 --> 00:56:03.090
They need to be able to see
individuals like yourselves

00:56:03.090 --> 00:56:06.060
and what you're doing,
so that they can see

00:56:06.060 --> 00:56:07.680
what their possibilities are.

00:56:07.680 --> 00:56:08.240
That's one.

00:56:08.240 --> 00:56:10.290
Two-- there are often
times when I have

00:56:10.290 --> 00:56:11.650
no idea what Google can offer.

00:56:11.650 --> 00:56:12.150
Right?

00:56:12.150 --> 00:56:13.830
It's the superficial
things that I see.

00:56:13.830 --> 00:56:15.300
I see that we can Google things.

00:56:15.300 --> 00:56:16.290
I see Google Hangouts.

00:56:16.290 --> 00:56:17.690
I see Google Docs.

00:56:17.690 --> 00:56:18.960
I understand Scratch.

00:56:18.960 --> 00:56:21.600
But there are other things
that Google can offer

00:56:21.600 --> 00:56:24.780
that I have no idea exists.

00:56:24.780 --> 00:56:29.850
So part of it is, educate
me on what that is.

00:56:29.850 --> 00:56:35.070
My overall goal is,
one day, in a way,

00:56:35.070 --> 00:56:38.670
to create more schools and
environments like this--

00:56:38.670 --> 00:56:40.410
to have those
Google-type schools,

00:56:40.410 --> 00:56:42.510
where it's about
true collaborations

00:56:42.510 --> 00:56:44.670
and setting up a
space that doesn't

00:56:44.670 --> 00:56:48.210
have as many constraints
as I have, because

00:56:48.210 --> 00:56:49.184
of the co-sharing.

00:56:49.184 --> 00:56:50.850
And really getting
people to understand,

00:56:50.850 --> 00:56:53.190
if you partner with
organizations like Google,

00:56:53.190 --> 00:56:55.800
Google is really willing to
take that on, and saying,

00:56:55.800 --> 00:56:58.500
we really want to be
invested in education.

00:56:58.500 --> 00:57:01.272
Let's create the spaces
that we do for the adults.

00:57:01.272 --> 00:57:03.480
But it makes no sense for
you to do it for the adults

00:57:03.480 --> 00:57:05.271
if you're not doing it
for the children who

00:57:05.271 --> 00:57:07.950
need to grow up to become those
adults to appreciate the space.

00:57:07.950 --> 00:57:10.122
Does that make sense?

00:57:10.122 --> 00:57:10.930
OK.

00:57:10.930 --> 00:57:12.630
So this was wonderful.

00:57:12.630 --> 00:57:14.800
I truly appreciate your time.

00:57:14.800 --> 00:57:16.530
I know some of you
have lunch or you have

00:57:16.530 --> 00:57:19.020
projects you need to work on.

00:57:19.020 --> 00:57:22.560
My story-- the full-out story
of how I opened up the school

00:57:22.560 --> 00:57:27.270
and a lot of the things that I
went through personally to get

00:57:27.270 --> 00:57:28.700
it to open--

00:57:28.700 --> 00:57:30.402
and it wasn't easy.

00:57:30.402 --> 00:57:32.610
It's, kind of, like, the
schools that I was in before

00:57:32.610 --> 00:57:37.670
was, dangerous minds means
lean on me, literally.

00:57:37.670 --> 00:57:41.160
However, had I not gone
through those experiences,

00:57:41.160 --> 00:57:43.350
I would not be as
relentless about creating

00:57:43.350 --> 00:57:47.520
a space where children are
safe, happy, learning to be--

00:57:47.520 --> 00:57:50.610
not just tolerant, because
we can tolerate a lot,

00:57:50.610 --> 00:57:53.040
but have to be accepting
of every single individual,

00:57:53.040 --> 00:57:55.570
because that's what
humanity is about.

00:57:55.570 --> 00:57:58.320
And so if I could do it
in Brownsville, Brooklyn

00:57:58.320 --> 00:58:00.480
under the circumstances
that I laid out,

00:58:00.480 --> 00:58:02.640
it can be done
anywhere in this world.

00:58:02.640 --> 00:58:04.050
Trust and believe that.

00:58:04.050 --> 00:58:07.350
So the story's in the
back for sale, yes.

00:58:07.350 --> 00:58:09.979
If anybody purchases it, I'll
be more than happy to sign it.

00:58:09.979 --> 00:58:11.520
But again, I thank
you, and thank you

00:58:11.520 --> 00:58:13.050
for this forum here at Google.

00:58:13.050 --> 00:58:16.100
[APPLAUSE]
