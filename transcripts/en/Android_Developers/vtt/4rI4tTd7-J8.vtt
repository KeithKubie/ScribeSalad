You probably already know
about Android Studio's

00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:04.836
live templates,
abbreviations displayed

00:00:04.836 --> 00:00:07.252
as code completion options
that insert a templated snippet

00:00:07.252 --> 00:00:08.864
into your code.

00:00:08.864 --> 00:00:10.280
There are dozens
of live templates

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:11.720
available in Android Studio.

00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:14.040
But did you know you can
create your own dynamic live

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:15.250
templates?

00:00:15.250 --> 00:00:17.280
If your least favorite
piece of boilerplate code

00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:18.690
hasn't yet been
templatized, it's

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:20.720
easy to create your
own live template.

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:22.390
Here, we're saving
a shared preference.

00:00:22.390 --> 00:00:24.681
It's a common pattern where
typically only the key name

00:00:24.681 --> 00:00:25.740
and value vary.

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:28.070
It's also not uncommon
to forget to call apply.

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:30.450
Let's copy this code and
go to the Preferences menu.

00:00:30.450 --> 00:00:32.662
Navigate to Editor,
then Live Templates.

00:00:32.662 --> 00:00:35.534
Then select Android, and choose
to Add a New Live Template.

00:00:35.534 --> 00:00:36.950
Enter an abbreviation
that will be

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:40.890
used as a shortcut and
a helpful description.

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:43.239
Then we paste in our code,
fully qualify the classpaths,

00:00:43.239 --> 00:00:45.030
and replace the paths
with our code snippet

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:47.449
that will be different
each time with variables.

00:00:47.449 --> 00:00:49.782
We'll be able to tab through
these when entering values.

00:00:52.380 --> 00:00:54.940
This template is applicable
within the context of a Java

00:00:54.940 --> 00:00:56.340
statement.

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:58.100
When we type a
resource string name,

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:00.257
we want it to offer us
order completion options.

00:01:04.124 --> 00:01:05.540
With our live
template defined, we

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:07.065
can start typing
the abbreviations.

00:01:07.065 --> 00:01:08.690
Select it from the
auto completion hint

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:11.454
by pressing Tab, and then
paste it in our snippet.

00:01:11.454 --> 00:01:14.220
Enter each value, tabbing
between them, and you're done.

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:16.930
More code with fewer keystrokes
thanks to Android Studio

00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:18.110
live templates.
