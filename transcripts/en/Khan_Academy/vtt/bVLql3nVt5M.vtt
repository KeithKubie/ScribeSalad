00:00:00.375 --> 00:00:02.001
- [Voiceover] Hello grammarians!

00:00:02.001 --> 00:00:05.367
Now, we've already talked about
how verbs can show actions

00:00:05.367 --> 00:00:08.293
and link concepts, and today
I'd like to talk about a third

00:00:08.293 --> 00:00:13.146
function of the verb, which
is helping other verbs.

00:00:13.146 --> 00:00:17.107
Now we call this the helping
verb, you may have heard it

00:00:17.107 --> 00:00:22.107
called that, or the auxiliary verb.

00:00:22.116 --> 00:00:24.679
These are just two words
for the same thing,

00:00:24.679 --> 00:00:28.673
auxiliary is just a more
Latin way to say helping,

00:00:28.673 --> 00:00:30.066
that's all it means.

00:00:30.066 --> 00:00:33.720
Now I've brought along an
image of my friend Brian

00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:35.879
to help explain this principle.

00:00:35.879 --> 00:00:40.570
What helping verbs are is
really just inflected forms

00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:44.118
of the verbs to have,

00:00:44.118 --> 00:00:46.440
and to be.

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:48.414
And as we get deeper into
the verb, I'll explain

00:00:48.414 --> 00:00:52.593
what each one means in each
one of its different versions,

00:00:52.593 --> 00:00:55.867
but for now, suffice it to
say, I'm just gonna throw

00:00:55.867 --> 00:00:59.257
out some examples, just so
you can see what it means

00:00:59.257 --> 00:01:02.577
for a helping verb to be a helping verb.

00:01:02.577 --> 00:01:04.783
So the specific way in
which helping verbs help

00:01:04.783 --> 00:01:09.148
is that they establish certain
facts about a sentence,

00:01:09.148 --> 00:01:12.074
usually when they're happening in time.

00:01:12.074 --> 00:01:14.187
And we'll get more and
more into that as we get

00:01:14.187 --> 00:01:18.575
more into tenses and aspect,
but I just wanna give you

00:01:18.575 --> 00:01:19.481
some examples.

00:01:19.481 --> 00:01:24.411
So, here we have Brian is eating a pizza.

00:01:30.592 --> 00:01:33.379
Brian and I love pizza, we
used to eat a lot of pizza.

00:01:33.379 --> 00:01:38.379
Brian has eaten a pizza.

00:01:43.502 --> 00:01:48.502
Brian was eating a pizza.

00:01:52.033 --> 00:01:57.033
And, finally, Brian had
been eating a pizza.

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:07.012
So the presence of all these helping verbs

00:02:07.012 --> 00:02:10.379
has different effects depending
on which ones you use.

00:02:10.379 --> 00:02:12.376
And, as I said, we'll
get into those later,

00:02:12.376 --> 00:02:17.284
but, just for a brief
overview, for example,

00:02:17.284 --> 00:02:20.339
let's see, Brian is eating
a pizza, that suggests

00:02:20.339 --> 00:02:21.988
that it's going on now.

00:02:21.988 --> 00:02:25.355
Brian has eaten a pizza,
that means he had done it,

00:02:25.355 --> 00:02:27.166
it's over, in the past.

00:02:27.166 --> 00:02:30.277
Brian was eating a pizza, which
means he was in the middle

00:02:30.277 --> 00:02:32.135
of eating a pizza when something happened.

00:02:32.135 --> 00:02:35.710
And, finally, Brian had
been eating a pizza.

00:02:35.710 --> 00:02:38.845
So he was doing it, and then
he stopped at some point

00:02:38.845 --> 00:02:39.983
in time.

00:02:39.983 --> 00:02:42.560
And this is just the
most basic introduction

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:44.232
to helping verbs.

00:02:44.232 --> 00:02:47.877
So, verbs can show actions,
verbs can link concepts,

00:02:47.877 --> 00:02:50.501
verbs can help other verbs.

00:02:50.501 --> 00:02:51.941
You can learn anything.

00:02:51.941 --> 00:02:53.630
David out.
