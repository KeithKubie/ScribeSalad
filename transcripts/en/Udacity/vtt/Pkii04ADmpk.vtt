00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.000
So the key point to notice here--

00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:05.000
and this is why the One-Time Pad provides perfect secrecy--

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:09.000
is that for any given ciphertext we can produce any message we want

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:10.000
by picking different keys.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
That means that if we just have the ciphertext,

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
we haven't learned anything at all about the message.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.000
The way to produce the message 'BS' from this ciphertext--

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:23.000
well, we just need to change this first letter to be one below

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:24.000
where C was.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
So that means we want to change this bit

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
to be a 0 instead of a 1 in the output.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
That means we need to flip one bit in the key.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:34.000
So we'll need to change this key bit

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.000
to be a 1 instead of a 0.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.000
Everything else will be the same.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.000
This will change the output letter by one.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:44.000
So if you guessed this key instead of the correct key,

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.000
we get what looks like a fairly reasonable message out

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.000
but it would be one off from the one that was there.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.000
And--in fact, we could get any possible message we want

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:53.000
by guessing different keys.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.000
So this is what's called a One-Time Pad,

00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:00.000
and that notion of a One-Time Pad goes back until at least 1882.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:05.000
It was discovered quite recently that it was known about this early.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.000
There were One-Time Pads used in World War I,

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:13.000
and used in many other contexts since then.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.000
The notion of the One-Time Pad being known this early

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:19.000
was only discovered last year by Steven Bellovin.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:21.000
What made a One-Time Pad really interesting was the analysis

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.000
that Claude Shannon did.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.000
Claude Shannon was the father of information theory.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.000
He did some of the first theoretical work in cryptography.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.000
During World War II, he studied communication,

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.000
and he also studied theory of secret systems,

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.000
and he wrote this paper, which was the first paper

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:41.000
that really understood in a theoretical way

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.000
what it means for a cipher to be good,

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.000
and this paper was written during World War II.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:49.000
It was classified and released in 1949.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:50.000
So what we're going to look at next is

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:53.000
how you formally reason about a cipher being secure

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:57.000
and why the One-Time Pad has all the security properties

00:01:57.000 --> 99:59:59.000
that make it a perfect cipher.
