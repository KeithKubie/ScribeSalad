00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:03.100
This should be 9.8 x 10 to the 8th.

00:00:04.270 --> 00:00:06.939
We moved the decimal to
the right two times.

00:00:06.939 --> 00:00:10.730
So we need to decrease
the power of 10 two times.

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:13.670
This should be 7.0 x 10 to the 9th.

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:18.320
We moved the decimal to
the left two times and so

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:20.920
we need to increase
the power of 10 two times.
