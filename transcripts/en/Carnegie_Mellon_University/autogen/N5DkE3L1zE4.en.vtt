you know how the funding is going in

00:23:44.970 --> 00:23:44.980
you know how the funding is going in
 

00:23:44.980 --> 00:23:47.009
you know how the funding is going in
terms of federal funding that you know

it's been flat and we don't know what's

00:23:48.600 --> 00:23:48.610
it's been flat and we don't know what's
 

00:23:48.610 --> 00:23:49.769
it's been flat and we don't know what's
gonna happen in the future

00:23:49.769 --> 00:23:49.779
gonna happen in the future
 

00:23:49.779 --> 00:23:53.659
gonna happen in the future
we need to be more agile in creating

00:23:53.659 --> 00:23:53.669
we need to be more agile in creating
 

00:23:53.669 --> 00:23:55.980
we need to be more agile in creating
creating such partnerships even more

00:23:55.980 --> 00:23:55.990
creating such partnerships even more
 

00:23:55.990 --> 00:23:57.680
creating such partnerships even more
than before

00:23:57.680 --> 00:23:57.690
than before
 

00:23:57.690 --> 00:24:00.690
than before
Dean Janis you mentioned earlier the

00:24:00.690 --> 00:24:00.700
Dean Janis you mentioned earlier the
 

00:24:00.700 --> 00:24:03.810
Dean Janis you mentioned earlier the
different purposes of universities and

00:24:03.810 --> 00:24:03.820
different purposes of universities and
 

00:24:03.820 --> 00:24:05.159
different purposes of universities and
corporations and we have a couple of

00:24:05.159 --> 00:24:05.169
corporations and we have a couple of
 

00:24:05.169 --> 00:24:05.700
corporations and we have a couple of
questions

00:24:05.700 --> 00:24:05.710
questions
 

00:24:05.710 --> 00:24:08.000
questions
here that go to the questions of culture

00:24:08.000 --> 00:24:08.010
here that go to the questions of culture
 

00:24:08.010 --> 00:24:10.019
here that go to the questions of culture
universities are very different places

00:24:10.019 --> 00:24:10.029
universities are very different places
 

00:24:10.029 --> 00:24:12.210
universities are very different places
from corporations with with different

00:24:12.210 --> 00:24:12.220
from corporations with with different
 

00:24:12.220 --> 00:24:15.210
from corporations with with different
core motivations perhaps overlapping

00:24:15.210 --> 00:24:15.220
core motivations perhaps overlapping
 

00:24:15.220 --> 00:24:17.370
core motivations perhaps overlapping
sets of interest but different cultures

00:24:17.370 --> 00:24:17.380
sets of interest but different cultures
 

00:24:17.380 --> 00:24:20.039
sets of interest but different cultures
what are the risks and obstacles that

00:24:20.039 --> 00:24:20.049
what are the risks and obstacles that
 

00:24:20.049 --> 00:24:22.019
what are the risks and obstacles that
that presents how do you overcome them

00:24:22.019 --> 00:24:22.029
that presents how do you overcome them
 

00:24:22.029 --> 00:24:23.940
that presents how do you overcome them
and what are their benefits that come

00:24:23.940 --> 00:24:23.950
and what are their benefits that come
 

00:24:23.950 --> 00:24:26.250
and what are their benefits that come
out of bringing to such distinct kinds

00:24:26.250 --> 00:24:26.260
out of bringing to such distinct kinds
 

00:24:26.260 --> 00:24:28.620
out of bringing to such distinct kinds
of cultures together Jay you want to

00:24:28.620 --> 00:24:28.630
of cultures together Jay you want to
 

00:24:28.630 --> 00:24:31.529
of cultures together Jay you want to
take that at first yeah I think you know

00:24:31.529 --> 00:24:31.539
take that at first yeah I think you know
 

00:24:31.539 --> 00:24:33.690
take that at first yeah I think you know
in both worlds yeah having a foot in

00:24:33.690 --> 00:24:33.700
in both worlds yeah having a foot in
 

00:24:33.700 --> 00:24:35.700
in both worlds yeah having a foot in
both those worlds and it's funny when

00:24:35.700 --> 00:24:35.710
both those worlds and it's funny when
 

00:24:35.710 --> 00:24:38.430
both those worlds and it's funny when
it's when a technology or a company

00:24:38.430 --> 00:24:38.440
it's when a technology or a company
 

00:24:38.440 --> 00:24:40.649
it's when a technology or a company
emerges from just an idea

00:24:40.649 --> 00:24:40.659
emerges from just an idea
 

00:24:40.659 --> 00:24:42.690
emerges from just an idea
there's almost no separation culturally

00:24:42.690 --> 00:24:42.700
there's almost no separation culturally
 

00:24:42.700 --> 00:24:45.450
there's almost no separation culturally
and what's been fascinating is to watch

00:24:45.450 --> 00:24:45.460
and what's been fascinating is to watch
 

00:24:45.460 --> 00:24:48.870
and what's been fascinating is to watch
how as you mature at the technology and

00:24:48.870 --> 00:24:48.880
how as you mature at the technology and
 

00:24:48.880 --> 00:24:52.110
how as you mature at the technology and
the entity the venture you need a

00:24:52.110 --> 00:24:52.120
the entity the venture you need a
 

00:24:52.120 --> 00:24:54.090
the entity the venture you need a
different sort of people and a different

00:24:54.090 --> 00:24:54.100
different sort of people and a different
 

00:24:54.100 --> 00:24:55.980
different sort of people and a different
sort of culture to make it really

00:24:55.980 --> 00:24:55.990
sort of culture to make it really
 

00:24:55.990 --> 00:24:58.350
sort of culture to make it really
ultimately effective and it's it's

00:24:58.350 --> 00:24:58.360
ultimately effective and it's it's
 

00:24:58.360 --> 00:25:00.450
ultimately effective and it's it's
complicated to grow in that way so I

00:25:00.450 --> 00:25:00.460
complicated to grow in that way so I
 

00:25:00.460 --> 00:25:01.860
complicated to grow in that way so I
really can appreciate that there's these

00:25:01.860 --> 00:25:01.870
really can appreciate that there's these
 

00:25:01.870 --> 00:25:03.750
really can appreciate that there's these
different buckets I think both sides

00:25:03.750 --> 00:25:03.760
different buckets I think both sides
 

00:25:03.760 --> 00:25:06.419
different buckets I think both sides
have and the best of worlds can really

00:25:06.419 --> 00:25:06.429
have and the best of worlds can really
 

00:25:06.429 --> 00:25:08.820
have and the best of worlds can really
appreciate each other and I think one of

00:25:08.820 --> 00:25:08.830
appreciate each other and I think one of
 

00:25:08.830 --> 00:25:11.460
appreciate each other and I think one of
the things in general is that it's

00:25:11.460 --> 00:25:11.470
the things in general is that it's
 

00:25:11.470 --> 00:25:13.399
the things in general is that it's
somewhat lopsided I feel like the

00:25:13.399 --> 00:25:13.409
somewhat lopsided I feel like the
 

00:25:13.409 --> 00:25:15.810
somewhat lopsided I feel like the
industrial world or the commercial world

00:25:15.810 --> 00:25:15.820
industrial world or the commercial world
 

00:25:15.820 --> 00:25:18.269
industrial world or the commercial world
has a deep appreciation for the academic

00:25:18.269 --> 00:25:18.279
has a deep appreciation for the academic
 

00:25:18.279 --> 00:25:19.680
has a deep appreciation for the academic
and I think the academic side of thing

00:25:19.680 --> 00:25:19.690
and I think the academic side of thing
 

00:25:19.690 --> 00:25:20.970
and I think the academic side of thing
often times doesn't have good visibility

00:25:20.970 --> 00:25:20.980
often times doesn't have good visibility
 

00:25:20.980 --> 00:25:22.860
often times doesn't have good visibility
into what's happening in the commercial

00:25:22.860 --> 00:25:22.870
into what's happening in the commercial
 

00:25:22.870 --> 00:25:25.529
into what's happening in the commercial
world industrial processes industrial

00:25:25.529 --> 00:25:25.539
world industrial processes industrial
 

00:25:25.539 --> 00:25:27.330
world industrial processes industrial
level or true business level

00:25:27.330 --> 00:25:27.340
level or true business level
 

00:25:27.340 --> 00:25:30.720
level or true business level
decision-making is often either not not

00:25:30.720 --> 00:25:30.730
decision-making is often either not not
 

00:25:30.730 --> 00:25:33.149
decision-making is often either not not
of interest to academics or it's just

00:25:33.149 --> 00:25:33.159
of interest to academics or it's just
 

00:25:33.159 --> 00:25:34.680
of interest to academics or it's just
something they're not presented with

00:25:34.680 --> 00:25:34.690
something they're not presented with
 

00:25:34.690 --> 00:25:36.630
something they're not presented with
with enough resolution to be interesting

00:25:36.630 --> 00:25:36.640
with enough resolution to be interesting
 

00:25:36.640 --> 00:25:39.960
with enough resolution to be interesting
to them and that that dichotomy is kind

00:25:39.960 --> 00:25:39.970
to them and that that dichotomy is kind
 

00:25:39.970 --> 00:25:42.299
to them and that that dichotomy is kind
of interesting in itself and so I find

00:25:42.299 --> 00:25:42.309
of interesting in itself and so I find
 

00:25:42.309 --> 00:25:45.060
of interesting in itself and so I find
myself now realizing how interesting

00:25:45.060 --> 00:25:45.070
myself now realizing how interesting
 

00:25:45.070 --> 00:25:47.220
myself now realizing how interesting
some industrial it's just engineering

00:25:47.220 --> 00:25:47.230
some industrial it's just engineering
 

00:25:47.230 --> 00:25:49.080
some industrial it's just engineering
kinds of projects are they're actually

00:25:49.080 --> 00:25:49.090
kinds of projects are they're actually
 

00:25:49.090 --> 00:25:51.060
kinds of projects are they're actually
deeply fundamental and they could be

00:25:51.060 --> 00:25:51.070
deeply fundamental and they could be
 

00:25:51.070 --> 00:25:52.710
deeply fundamental and they could be
highly academic but they're just not

00:25:52.710 --> 00:25:52.720
highly academic but they're just not
 

00:25:52.720 --> 00:25:55.289
highly academic but they're just not
seen that way in the academic community

00:25:55.289 --> 00:25:55.299
seen that way in the academic community
 

00:25:55.299 --> 00:25:57.360
seen that way in the academic community
and so you know one thing that could be

00:25:57.360 --> 00:25:57.370
and so you know one thing that could be
 

00:25:57.370 --> 00:25:59.610
and so you know one thing that could be
done I think is to pull a bit more of

00:25:59.610 --> 00:25:59.620
done I think is to pull a bit more of
 

00:25:59.620 --> 00:26:01.769
done I think is to pull a bit more of
what is interesting about it about the

00:26:01.769 --> 00:26:01.779
what is interesting about it about the
 

00:26:01.779 --> 00:26:04.320
what is interesting about it about the
the manufacturing industrial world you

00:26:04.320 --> 00:26:04.330
the manufacturing industrial world you
 

00:26:04.330 --> 00:26:06.299
the manufacturing industrial world you
can distill out some really amazing more

00:26:06.299 --> 00:26:06.309
can distill out some really amazing more
 

00:26:06.309 --> 00:26:08.220
can distill out some really amazing more
fundamental things that I think could

00:26:08.220 --> 00:26:08.230
fundamental things that I think could
 

00:26:08.230 --> 00:26:09.360
fundamental things that I think could
project an academia

00:26:09.360 --> 00:26:09.370
project an academia
 

00:26:09.370 --> 00:26:10.680
project an academia
more effectively especially the

00:26:10.680 --> 00:26:10.690
more effectively especially the
 

00:26:10.690 --> 00:26:11.970
more effectively especially the
bottlenecks maybe don't need you yeah

00:26:11.970 --> 00:26:11.980
bottlenecks maybe don't need you yeah
 

00:26:11.980 --> 00:26:14.310
bottlenecks maybe don't need you yeah
those keep all next in they're not it's

00:26:14.310 --> 00:26:14.320
those keep all next in they're not it's
 

00:26:14.320 --> 00:26:15.870
those keep all next in they're not it's
not just engineering it's not just this

00:26:15.870 --> 00:26:15.880
not just engineering it's not just this
 

00:26:15.880 --> 00:26:17.520
not just engineering it's not just this
go solve the problem there's some real

00:26:17.520 --> 00:26:17.530
go solve the problem there's some real
 

00:26:17.530 --> 00:26:19.980
go solve the problem there's some real
interesting basic things that could be

00:26:19.980 --> 00:26:19.990
interesting basic things that could be
 

00:26:19.990 --> 00:26:23.040
interesting basic things that could be
done that often I I I see a lot of the

00:26:23.040 --> 00:26:23.050
done that often I I I see a lot of the
 

00:26:23.050 --> 00:26:24.780
done that often I I I see a lot of the
work that's being done and you know if

00:26:24.780 --> 00:26:24.790
work that's being done and you know if
 

00:26:24.790 --> 00:26:25.950
work that's being done and you know if
that person would just look at this

00:26:25.950 --> 00:26:25.960
that person would just look at this
 

00:26:25.960 --> 00:26:27.990
that person would just look at this
problem this could be fascinating and

00:26:27.990 --> 00:26:28.000
problem this could be fascinating and
 

00:26:28.000 --> 00:26:30.450
problem this could be fascinating and
boy could we solve this faster Chandra

00:26:30.450 --> 00:26:30.460
boy could we solve this faster Chandra
 

00:26:30.460 --> 00:26:36.230
boy could we solve this faster Chandra
you had some I think it's the beauty of

00:26:36.230 --> 00:26:36.240
you had some I think it's the beauty of
 

00:26:36.240 --> 00:26:38.370
you had some I think it's the beauty of
of this whole thing is about having

00:26:38.370 --> 00:26:38.380
of this whole thing is about having
 

00:26:38.380 --> 00:26:40.170
of this whole thing is about having
those two cultures on the one side on

00:26:40.170 --> 00:26:40.180
those two cultures on the one side on
 

00:26:40.180 --> 00:26:42.330
those two cultures on the one side on
the other side when or you are trying to

00:26:42.330 --> 00:26:42.340
the other side when or you are trying to
 

00:26:42.340 --> 00:26:43.830
the other side when or you are trying to
solve a problem and people who come

00:26:43.830 --> 00:26:43.840
solve a problem and people who come
 

00:26:43.840 --> 00:26:47.310
solve a problem and people who come
together they they kind of have a common

00:26:47.310 --> 00:26:47.320
together they they kind of have a common
 

00:26:47.320 --> 00:26:49.320
together they they kind of have a common
objective I mean if you're talking about

00:26:49.320 --> 00:26:49.330
objective I mean if you're talking about
 

00:26:49.330 --> 00:26:53.549
objective I mean if you're talking about
researching you know things are in or in

00:26:53.549 --> 00:26:53.559
researching you know things are in or in
 

00:26:53.559 --> 00:26:54.870
researching you know things are in or in
solving a specific problem and

00:26:54.870 --> 00:26:54.880
solving a specific problem and
 

00:26:54.880 --> 00:26:58.440
solving a specific problem and
driverless car or whatever it is the the

00:26:58.440 --> 00:26:58.450
driverless car or whatever it is the the
 

00:26:58.450 --> 00:27:02.580
driverless car or whatever it is the the
people from in this case TCS and the

00:27:02.580 --> 00:27:02.590
people from in this case TCS and the
 

00:27:02.590 --> 00:27:05.130
people from in this case TCS and the
researchers from CMU or driven by the

00:27:05.130 --> 00:27:05.140
researchers from CMU or driven by the
 

00:27:05.140 --> 00:27:07.650
researchers from CMU or driven by the
common objective then you know then the

00:27:07.650 --> 00:27:07.660
common objective then you know then the
 

00:27:07.660 --> 00:27:10.620
common objective then you know then the
passion takes over everything else right

00:27:10.620 --> 00:27:10.630
passion takes over everything else right
 

00:27:10.630 --> 00:27:12.750
passion takes over everything else right
so it's finding the common problem yeah

00:27:12.750 --> 00:27:12.760
so it's finding the common problem yeah
 

00:27:12.760 --> 00:27:17.120
so it's finding the common problem yeah
it's funny the common interest

00:27:17.120 --> 00:27:17.130
it's funny the common interest
 

00:27:17.130 --> 00:27:19.770
it's funny the common interest
it's the problems at the end of the day

00:27:19.770 --> 00:27:19.780
it's the problems at the end of the day
 

00:27:19.780 --> 00:27:23.340
it's the problems at the end of the day
which which drive people try people yeah

00:27:23.340 --> 00:27:23.350
which which drive people try people yeah
 

00:27:23.350 --> 00:27:24.840
which which drive people try people yeah
I don't think that in the end there are

00:27:24.840 --> 00:27:24.850
I don't think that in the end there are
 

00:27:24.850 --> 00:27:27.690
I don't think that in the end there are
real obstacle to the cultures themselves

00:27:27.690 --> 00:27:27.700
real obstacle to the cultures themselves
 

00:27:27.700 --> 00:27:29.100
real obstacle to the cultures themselves
pose obstacles because if you get

00:27:29.100 --> 00:27:29.110
pose obstacles because if you get
 

00:27:29.110 --> 00:27:31.560
pose obstacles because if you get
together and you have something you want

00:27:31.560 --> 00:27:31.570
together and you have something you want
 

00:27:31.570 --> 00:27:33.299
together and you have something you want
to do together you know it's actually

00:27:33.299 --> 00:27:33.309
to do together you know it's actually
 

00:27:33.309 --> 00:27:35.340
to do together you know it's actually
these these different cultures just

00:27:35.340 --> 00:27:35.350
these these different cultures just
 

00:27:35.350 --> 00:27:37.350
these these different cultures just
bring a diverse points of view so it's I

00:27:37.350 --> 00:27:37.360
bring a diverse points of view so it's I
 

00:27:37.360 --> 00:27:40.290
bring a diverse points of view so it's I
I don't know that we have you know that

00:27:40.290 --> 00:27:40.300
I don't know that we have you know that
 

00:27:40.300 --> 00:27:42.690
I don't know that we have you know that
I've ever heard of people not enjoying

00:27:42.690 --> 00:27:42.700
I've ever heard of people not enjoying
 

00:27:42.700 --> 00:27:44.610
I've ever heard of people not enjoying
this or not and you know this was any

00:27:44.610 --> 00:27:44.620
this or not and you know this was any
 

00:27:44.620 --> 00:27:46.740
this or not and you know this was any
sort of an obstacle if anything it's

00:27:46.740 --> 00:27:46.750
sort of an obstacle if anything it's
 

00:27:46.750 --> 00:27:50.580
sort of an obstacle if anything it's
actually exciting I have a great

00:27:50.580 --> 00:27:50.590
actually exciting I have a great
 

00:27:50.590 --> 00:27:53.490
actually exciting I have a great
question here that same toward the TCS

00:27:53.490 --> 00:27:53.500
question here that same toward the TCS
 

00:27:53.500 --> 00:27:55.140
question here that same toward the TCS
are framed about the TCS CMU

00:27:55.140 --> 00:27:55.150
are framed about the TCS CMU
 

00:27:55.150 --> 00:27:56.490
are framed about the TCS CMU
collaboration but I think could be

00:27:56.490 --> 00:27:56.500
collaboration but I think could be
 

00:27:56.500 --> 00:27:58.950
collaboration but I think could be
opened up more broadly to all industry

00:27:58.950 --> 00:27:58.960
opened up more broadly to all industry
 

00:27:58.960 --> 00:28:00.840
opened up more broadly to all industry
academic partnerships how do you engage

00:28:00.840 --> 00:28:00.850
academic partnerships how do you engage
 

00:28:00.850 --> 00:28:03.570
academic partnerships how do you engage
students what can they bring to it how

00:28:03.570 --> 00:28:03.580
students what can they bring to it how
 

00:28:03.580 --> 00:28:06.960
students what can they bring to it how
do they benefit from it I think one of

00:28:06.960 --> 00:28:06.970
do they benefit from it I think one of
 

00:28:06.970 --> 00:28:09.330
do they benefit from it I think one of
the objectives for us in this whole

00:28:09.330 --> 00:28:09.340
the objectives for us in this whole
 

00:28:09.340 --> 00:28:10.450
the objectives for us in this whole
partnership is team

00:28:10.450 --> 00:28:10.460
partnership is team
 

00:28:10.460 --> 00:28:15.460
partnership is team
students I think what we envisage is to

00:28:15.460 --> 00:28:15.470
students I think what we envisage is to
 

00:28:15.470 --> 00:28:18.159
students I think what we envisage is to
is to create a number of projects which

00:28:18.159 --> 00:28:18.169
is to create a number of projects which
 

00:28:18.169 --> 00:28:21.850
is to create a number of projects which
are going to be giant projects we

00:28:21.850 --> 00:28:21.860
are going to be giant projects we
 

00:28:21.860 --> 00:28:23.440
are going to be giant projects we
imagine that there will be teachers

00:28:23.440 --> 00:28:23.450
imagine that there will be teachers
 

00:28:23.450 --> 00:28:28.299
imagine that there will be teachers
researchers will be collocated here with

00:28:28.299 --> 00:28:28.309
researchers will be collocated here with
 

00:28:28.309 --> 00:28:32.649
researchers will be collocated here with
same you faculty CMU students solving a

00:28:32.649 --> 00:28:32.659
same you faculty CMU students solving a
 

00:28:32.659 --> 00:28:34.859
same you faculty CMU students solving a
particular problem and you've got some

00:28:34.859 --> 00:28:34.869
particular problem and you've got some
 

00:28:34.869 --> 00:28:39.340
particular problem and you've got some
idea about the areas we want to focus on

00:28:39.340 --> 00:28:39.350
idea about the areas we want to focus on
 

00:28:39.350 --> 00:28:42.820
idea about the areas we want to focus on
and the reverse will also happen we hope

00:28:42.820 --> 00:28:42.830
and the reverse will also happen we hope
 

00:28:42.830 --> 00:28:45.340
and the reverse will also happen we hope
that some some one CMU faculty will

00:28:45.340 --> 00:28:45.350
that some some one CMU faculty will
 

00:28:45.350 --> 00:28:47.980
that some some one CMU faculty will
visit and be with us and you know work

00:28:47.980 --> 00:28:47.990
visit and be with us and you know work
 

00:28:47.990 --> 00:28:50.230
visit and be with us and you know work
with us in our labs and in india at time

00:28:50.230 --> 00:28:50.240
with us in our labs and in india at time
 

00:28:50.240 --> 00:28:54.399
with us in our labs and in india at time
to time maybe CMU students will be part

00:28:54.399 --> 00:28:54.409
to time maybe CMU students will be part
 

00:28:54.409 --> 00:28:56.680
to time maybe CMU students will be part
of one of these projects and may do

00:28:56.680 --> 00:28:56.690
of one of these projects and may do
 

00:28:56.690 --> 00:28:59.739
of one of these projects and may do
interns in pcs in some exciting projects

00:28:59.739 --> 00:28:59.749
interns in pcs in some exciting projects
 

00:28:59.749 --> 00:29:01.239
interns in pcs in some exciting projects
and the other thing we are talking about

00:29:01.239 --> 00:29:01.249
and the other thing we are talking about
 

00:29:01.249 --> 00:29:05.549
and the other thing we are talking about
is how to engage students in some of the

00:29:05.549 --> 00:29:05.559
is how to engage students in some of the
 

00:29:05.559 --> 00:29:08.409
is how to engage students in some of the
engineering colleges with whom we work

00:29:08.409 --> 00:29:08.419
engineering colleges with whom we work
 

00:29:08.419 --> 00:29:11.049
engineering colleges with whom we work
in India how do we bring those students

00:29:11.049 --> 00:29:11.059
in India how do we bring those students
 

00:29:11.059 --> 00:29:13.149
in India how do we bring those students
together on the CMU students together

00:29:13.149 --> 00:29:13.159
together on the CMU students together
 

00:29:13.159 --> 00:29:16.210
together on the CMU students together
maybe through an online platform maybe

00:29:16.210 --> 00:29:16.220
maybe through an online platform maybe
 

00:29:16.220 --> 00:29:19.629
maybe through an online platform maybe
through you've got some ideas we've got

00:29:19.629 --> 00:29:19.639
through you've got some ideas we've got
 

00:29:19.639 --> 00:29:23.649
through you've got some ideas we've got
some prototypes those details are we we

00:29:23.649 --> 00:29:23.659
some prototypes those details are we we
 

00:29:23.659 --> 00:29:25.690
some prototypes those details are we we
work through but the most exciting thing

00:29:25.690 --> 00:29:25.700
work through but the most exciting thing
 

00:29:25.700 --> 00:29:27.940
work through but the most exciting thing
in this whole partnership is not only

00:29:27.940 --> 00:29:27.950
in this whole partnership is not only
 

00:29:27.950 --> 00:29:30.669
in this whole partnership is not only
the research element but also the idea

00:29:30.669 --> 00:29:30.679
the research element but also the idea
 

00:29:30.679 --> 00:29:32.379
the research element but also the idea
generation by getting all these students

00:29:32.379 --> 00:29:32.389
generation by getting all these students
 

00:29:32.389 --> 00:29:34.779
generation by getting all these students
together because you know I was in a

00:29:34.779 --> 00:29:34.789
together because you know I was in a
 

00:29:34.789 --> 00:29:36.909
together because you know I was in a

this was actually through again the

00:30:01.299 --> 00:30:01.309
this was actually through again the
 

00:30:01.309 --> 00:30:02.739
this was actually through again the
connections are it's all about

00:30:02.739 --> 00:30:02.749
connections are it's all about
 

00:30:02.749 --> 00:30:05.649
connections are it's all about
connections it was my my ex PhD student

00:30:05.649 --> 00:30:05.659
connections it was my my ex PhD student
 

00:30:05.659 --> 00:30:07.840
connections it was my my ex PhD student
who wanted to create some sort of a

00:30:07.840 --> 00:30:07.850
who wanted to create some sort of a
 

00:30:07.850 --> 00:30:10.810
who wanted to create some sort of a
formalized internship program with CMU

00:30:10.810 --> 00:30:10.820
formalized internship program with CMU
 

00:30:10.820 --> 00:30:13.779
formalized internship program with CMU
and they sent they actually we cared

00:30:13.779 --> 00:30:13.789
and they sent they actually we cared
 

00:30:13.789 --> 00:30:15.789
and they sent they actually we cared
their best students with our faculty and

faculty we're really excited to get this
underground the interns and they were

00:30:19.239 --> 00:30:19.249
underground the interns and they were
 

00:30:19.249 --> 00:30:21.220
underground the interns and they were
fantastic so you know they're gonna go

00:30:21.220 --> 00:30:21.230
fantastic so you know they're gonna go
 

00:30:21.230 --> 00:30:22.989
fantastic so you know they're gonna go
back they worked with our faculty in our

00:30:22.989 --> 00:30:22.999
back they worked with our faculty in our
 

00:30:22.999 --> 00:30:24.159
back they worked with our faculty in our
graduate students they're going

00:30:24.159 --> 00:30:24.169
graduate students they're going
 

00:30:24.169 --> 00:30:26.409
graduate students they're going
go back and it's kind of like you know

00:30:26.409 --> 00:30:26.419
go back and it's kind of like you know
 

00:30:26.419 --> 00:30:28.599
go back and it's kind of like you know
it's a it's a multiplier right so the

00:30:28.599 --> 00:30:28.609
it's a it's a multiplier right so the
 

00:30:28.609 --> 00:30:31.330
it's a it's a multiplier right so the
good things from CMU go that way and you

00:30:31.330 --> 00:30:31.340
good things from CMU go that way and you
 

00:30:31.340 --> 00:30:33.489
good things from CMU go that way and you
know we we will be able to go back and

00:30:33.489 --> 00:30:33.499
know we we will be able to go back and
 

00:30:33.499 --> 00:30:35.499
know we we will be able to go back and
you know perhaps a change in our faculty

00:30:35.499 --> 00:30:35.509
you know perhaps a change in our faculty
 

00:30:35.509 --> 00:30:37.810
you know perhaps a change in our faculty
will go there and give talks and so on

00:30:37.810 --> 00:30:37.820
will go there and give talks and so on
 

00:30:37.820 --> 00:30:40.180
will go there and give talks and so on
if we have now an industrial or

00:30:40.180 --> 00:30:40.190
if we have now an industrial or
 

00:30:40.190 --> 00:30:42.159
if we have now an industrial or
corporate partner we can you know add

00:30:42.159 --> 00:30:42.169
corporate partner we can you know add
 

00:30:42.169 --> 00:30:44.169
corporate partner we can you know add
more of these you know educational

00:30:44.169 --> 00:30:44.179
more of these you know educational
 

00:30:44.179 --> 00:30:46.690
more of these you know educational
institutions and no more than one place

00:30:46.690 --> 00:30:46.700
institutions and no more than one place
 

00:30:46.700 --> 00:30:49.419
institutions and no more than one place
plus industry to help us perhaps

00:30:49.419 --> 00:30:49.429
plus industry to help us perhaps
 

00:30:49.429 --> 00:30:53.769
plus industry to help us perhaps
facilitate that yeah and just to

00:30:53.769 --> 00:30:53.779
facilitate that yeah and just to
 

00:30:53.779 --> 00:30:55.629
facilitate that yeah and just to
reinforce that we truly are in a

00:30:55.629 --> 00:30:55.639
reinforce that we truly are in a
 

00:30:55.639 --> 00:30:58.299
reinforce that we truly are in a
national university a huge fraction of
