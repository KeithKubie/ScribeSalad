Speaker 1:          00:01          Jad, Robert, Radiolab. Are these all 24 amendments? Do you have songs? Oh my friend. Did you say 24 amendments are the 26? I don't know how many there were there. 27, 27 of you. Of all people. I thought we'd know that. I know where they re they add one every so often. So, okay, let me explain this. Let me explain this project for you. Okay. Okay. So a more perfect now is entering its third season, right?

Speaker 2:          00:28          Yay.

Speaker 1:          00:31          The first two seasons, what were they? They were, they were extended investigative, uh, highly reported and researched and elaborated stories about the supreme court cases in front of the screen. Yeah. But the idea was of more perfect cause always broader than just the court. I mean, the idea is to look at the argument that just so happens to happen at the court and in the process of America sort of trying to try to claw its way out of the muck to get to higher ideals. Now those ideals of course, are outlined in the constitution, which has been amended 27 times in ways that are crucially important. Especially right now. And uh, most Americans can't name more than one or two of them. I was one of those people before more perfect. And so, uh, when I was on my break, I had this idea, crazy idea, which was could we make an album?

Speaker 1:          01:28          Could we make a school house rock for the 21st century that reanimated these amendments. Oh, a lot of times aspiration. Oh, well it's like you got to go big, right? That's a very didactic thing like that. In those songs you actually are told exactly how to feel about the concert. I'm just a bill. Yes. I'm only a bill and I'm sitting here on Capitol Hill. Yes. But the idea was could we take the spirit of it but not like didactic in the way the old stuff was. But like taking these things that we had been covering for two seasons with the amendments of the constitution, the bill of rights one through 10, the other ones from 11 to 27, uh, taking them and, and, and because they're so stodgy and musty, like the language, some of them are really opaque. Yeah. I mean, and so the idea was could we take these stuffy, stodgy, sometimes opaque, deeply important, uh, words and bring them to life.

Speaker 1:          02:25          So we reached out to a ton of different musicians and ask them like, would you interpret these amendments? Uh, you can talk explicitly about the amendments if you want, or you can turn it into something very personal to you. What could they do it though? Let me, I don't know. Let me just play you a couple of, let me see me. Let me wish I play one. Should I choose one? Choose one? Yeah. Okay. I'm going to choose swimming. Suffrage. Which one is that? That's the 1919 yeah. Oh, you can show us a good one. You chose a good one, my friend. Am I going to get musically first of all? Okay. You're going to get drum roll please. Dolly Parton, Dolly Parton, Dolly, Dolly Parton Doll E. Pardon? Or a Dolly puck. The dog and the tourney dollar doll hyphen eve. No, no, I was just maybe your middle name. Like Robert E. Lee. His first cousin please. No. Sally Martin. Really? Yes. I'll play a little bit of her song.

Speaker 3:          03:28          August 18th, 1920 women suffrage and then ratify.

Speaker 4:          03:36          Women have been fighting for the legal right to vote since the 1840s in 1890 the national American women's suffrage association in a w s a was established with Susan B. Anthony is leading force. Women have been fighting for their rights since the very beginning of time. [inaudible] first they said we couldn't have danced. Them said we couldn't drink. Some man allowed it. They said we couldn't think. They said we shouldn't speak to. We were spoken to. There's just so much we were allowed to do, but the first month, I'm just reading the truth. That's when you got smart nuts, truth, but we have to fight for women's rights. They certainly [inaudible] we can size because of times marched up and down the streets, the women's rights walk nesters on our feet. We got tired of seeing. Then we can tell how [inaudible] Thrones, Ali Brown, when women finally got the right tempo.

Speaker 1:          05:18          So good. There's so many great turns of phrases in that song. Wow. Do you want to hear another one? I mean, I'm really curious about like a, an amendment like a technical and member, like the 25th, like what could you possibly, oh, let me play the 25th you on here though. One Oh 25th is the, is the [inaudible] oh, that's very interesting. This is session one. The 25th Amendment is the amendment that that establishes an order of succession if the president can't do his job. So Devendra Banhart is a, um, is a sort of a freak folk musician. He does like sort of psychedelic folk. Uh, good Tillich folk. It's a, it's a whole genre. Hello, my name is Devendra Banhart and I chose the 25th amendment truths about succession. He's an amazing songwriter and he wrote a really funny song that takes you through the line of succession.

Speaker 5:          06:09          [inaudible] 1600 Washington DC that we're in on no pony [inaudible] even though I'm at the bottom of the beds. [inaudible] succession, that's been [inaudible] since the 17 hundreds till today. [inaudible]. It all began when the president at a sudden total awakening that completely rearrange this state of hog [inaudible]. And even worse than a newly grown moral compass in a developing code of ethics, they got into [inaudible] [inaudible]. And so at the White House they win and next came the vice president. Too much drywall, I have to sing, Lincoln's Co's float. Oh, so very distant proving the pole [inaudible] and so the speaker of the House of Representatives, puppets and lead the, due to the little jobs roles and responsibilities, they rarely spoke. And so ironically, when it came time to tug, they clammed up. And so the president [inaudible] sure.

Speaker 1:          07:32          So what he's doing is he's knocking off every person who becomes president and then you find that you meet the next one in the line. And I think, I think the sort of the, the whole conceit is that everybody dies and it also ends up with him being president. Wow. So, so some musicians really went to law books and just look very kid some case. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Let's try one more where we just get somebody took the idea of the amendment and went with a feeling rather than with the list. Yeah. First Amendment is good. The First Amendment, number one, the big one. [inaudible] let me play that one after the break. Hi, this is Ravi calling from Brooklyn. New York. Radiolab is supported in part by the Alfred p Sloan Foundation enhancing public understanding of science and technology in the modern world. More information aboutSloan@wwwdotsloan.org hey, it's Chad. I boom. Rod this season and more perfect from w NYC studios might be the most perfect yet

Speaker 6:          08:30          19th amendment women have been fighting for the legal right to vote since the 1840s. This season we are making an album featuring, for example, Dali part an album of songs and stories inspired by the amendments to the u s constitution.

Speaker 1:          08:48          Listen to more perfect wherever you get your podcasts. This is Radiolab.

Speaker 7:          08:56          I'm Jad. I have him. Rod, he was a rapper. Krulwich uh, offering up a preview of an experiment that we're doing for the new season of more perfect, uh, where we are releasing an album. Uh, it's called 27 the most perfect album. You can find it on iTunes and Spotify. You can also find all the songs@themostperfectalbum.org. Now, on the podcast, uh, we're not just putting out music, we're, we're telling stories. We're telling these sort of funny, quirky, poetic, sometimes sad, sometimes hilarious, uh, sort of explainer stories about each of the 27 amendments. I think of them as sort of like audio liner notes for the songs. Uh, let me play you, uh, the, the story that we tell in conjunction with the first amendment in the podcast. Sorry, Karrie, producer it more perfect. Created this little story. I'm gonna drop into the middle of it where she's talking with a guy named Burt Neuborne who is a law professor and he to him, the first amendment is like a poem. So let's drop into that one. You'll hear a reporter Sar Cari, uh, actor Jeffrey Wright reading the amendments and professor Burt Neuborne talking about First Amendment, freedom of religion, speech, Press, assembly and petition. It consists of six ideas. Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion or prohibiting the free exercise thereof or abridging the freedom of speech or the press or the right of the people peaceably to assemble and to petition the government for a redress of grievances. Six it's only 45 words long. It could have been written on the back of an envelope

Speaker 8:          10:27          these days. The first amendment is wrapped up in all kinds of thorny stuff like kneeling at football games and hate speech and money in politics. But if you just step back from all of that and you read the text of the first amendment and you really try to think about what the words are trying to say, you find that the logic behind it is

Speaker 9:          10:54          [inaudible]

Speaker 10:         10:54          kind of beautiful. And the order of the words in the first amendment is the lifecycle of a democratic idea.

Speaker 8:          11:04          Here's what he means.

Speaker 10:         11:07          So those first two clauses, Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion or prohibiting the free exercise thereof. Create a free space inside your mind to think and believe as you wish.

Speaker 8:          11:22          That's the founder saying that space inside your head where you think your thoughts that sacred. The government can't touch that

Speaker 10:         11:29          without that free space. That can be no shelf government. So that's the first idea, the freedom of your thoughts.

Speaker 5:          11:38          [inaudible]

Speaker 10:         11:39          once you've believed and thought something, then bet it's natural for you to want to say it. Which brings us to the next clause or abridging the freedom of speech. The speech clause says, if you've got an idea formed in the freedom of your mind, by all means go ahead and share it. So you have the freedom to think of thought, the freedom to speak that thought, but that's not a new, if you really want to make a real new type of dance in a society, so you need some way to be able to speak to one of the mass of people to speak their really loud voice, which brings you to the fourth clause for the press, which is speech amplify. Then once you've gotten your message out to a large number of people where people would listen to these ideas and move by them, it's natural for those people to want to do something about it, to move together, to organize for the right of the people piece of it.

Speaker 4:          12:45          [inaudible]

Speaker 10:         12:46          so you can think of thigh, you can speak that thought. You can create a movement, but that's not enough. Finally, the petition clause, which is the sixth idea. The petition clause says once you've assembled, once you've organized,

Speaker 4:          13:00          just wait up man. The protection of our curves, the amendment rights we have, sir, we are sir.

Speaker 10:         13:07          They do have a right to take your argument to the government and to petition the government for a redress of grievances.

Speaker 4:          13:14          We can speak for this country and we demand reform now

Speaker 10:         13:20          forced the government into confronting it and either accepting or rejecting and then that government, if it says no is subject to being voted out of office

Speaker 5:          13:34          [inaudible]

Speaker 10:         13:34          so this is Madison giving us the blueprint for tomorrow.

Speaker 5:          13:41          [inaudible]

Speaker 10:         13:43          when democracy begins

Speaker 5:          13:47          [inaudible]

Speaker 8:          13:48          the way I'm hearing it is like like co centric circles like starting in inside the mind of one person and then like reverberating out. No,

Speaker 10:         13:58          exactly. The First Amendment is a a series of concentric circles beginning within your mind and then moving to your closer acquaintances then to the society at large and then finally to the entire polity to the entire people. I bet that by the way is the only time in human history that those six ideas have ever been United in a single taxed. Only time. I went back and looked at every single rights bearing document in our tradition all the way from the magna Carta through the English bills of rights, through the colonial charters, through the state constitution, through the French declaration of the rights of man. It's never been done before to put the six building blocks of democracy together in a single coherent text.

Speaker 5:          14:53          [inaudible] the first amendment is the ideal city on the hill. It is the ideal community that the founders were trying to establish and remember, establish for the first time in human history. [inaudible] wow. [inaudible] I've never thought of it that way. It's a little bit like some kind of a very thoughtful relay race where each, as the baton is passed, it's, it's the next logical step to turning what is inside you into powerful statements outside of you.

Speaker 1:          15:29          Yeah, so that's a the first amendment line. Right.

Speaker 11:         15:32          Well, actually, the other thing about that, about, now that you've got me thinking about the way that kite described the first amendment as this progression of ideas, I mean it's, it's, it just comes almost like just in about a couple of centuries after people like Shakespeare and Servon Dyson begin creating interiority like this. Like they want to ne did, you really wasn't any place to go to hear someone talking to herself or himself. Yeah. And not even a couple of centuries path. And then you get a government that, that takes that idea that people have an interior and that interior is distinct and needs protection from the government and then comes this, this six point flow. Wow. I never really thought of that.

Speaker 1:          16:20          Yeah, it's a cool idea. Um, but interestingly, the song that that's paired with at, um, on the album, I mean actually if we've got a couple of different submissions for the first amendment, but one of them came from, uh, a guy named Joey styles. He's a native Canadian, uh, first nation Matisse, um, hip hop artist. And, uh, he made a song which sort of argues with the spirit of Bert newborns take, um, he sort of looked at sort of all the people that have been left out of that city on the hill.

Speaker 12:         16:55          How my track goes. As part two, I was dealing with the freedom of religion from 1870 up until 1934 was legal for native Americans to practice our ceremonies. I had in mind specifically the ghost dance as an 1890 at wounded knee, 150 to 300. Mostly women and children were massacre for ghost dancing. And to me that shows they were scared. They were scared of us, have in our culture and ceremonies because they empower us. I truly hope the warrior spirit shines on this track on a natural side of being wild or free sets the tone. Oh,

Speaker 5:          17:48          [inaudible] [inaudible]

Speaker 11:         18:10          where you up to solve for the people? Oh, now we'll never fear any. This is really, I mean the lyrics and the musical traces are all not there. There you really challenge your sense of the amendment a little bit so that these songs, the way they're written and the words that have been chosen, and then when did they even strike our hall? Either arguments of tempo or arguments of spirit or arguments of history.

Speaker 1:          18:41          Yeah. I would say 80% of the songs on the record, um, are arguments with the amendments rather than just celebrations or explanations of them. Uh, it's, it's, yeah. Well this is very interesting. It's cool, right? Yeah. So a very different way to do it. Yeah. Um, so that was, this was just a preview it for years to, to hear more, uh, go to wherever you get podcasts, search for more. Perfect. Um, sign up radiolab.org/more. Perfect. We'll take you there. Um, if you want to hear the record, it's a great record. I'm so proud of it. Uh, go to iTunes, Spotify, wherever, searched for 27, the most perfect album, and you can hear all the songs in their entirety@themostperfectalbum.org. Okay. I'm Jad Abumrad I'm Robert Krulwich.
