00:00:00.540 --> 00:00:02.660
What I want to do in this video
is to talk a little bit

00:00:02.660 --> 00:00:03.910
about spectrophotometry.

00:00:09.220 --> 00:00:12.320
Spectrophotometry sounds fairly
sophisticated, but it's

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:15.380
really based on a fairly
simple principle.

00:00:15.380 --> 00:00:20.610
So let's say we have two
solutions that contain some

00:00:20.610 --> 00:00:21.510
type of solute.

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:25.150
So that is solution one, and
then this is solution two.

00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:28.540
And let's just assume that our
beakers have the same width.

00:00:28.540 --> 00:00:30.660
Now let's say solution 1-- let
me put it right here, number

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:33.480
1, and number 2.

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:39.800
Now let's say that solution 1
has less of the solute in it.

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:42.210
So that's the water
line right there.

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:43.480
So this guy has less of it.

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:46.220
And let's say it's yellow or to
our eyes it looks yellow.

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:48.690
So this has less of it.

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:50.330
Actually, let me
do it this way.

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:51.420
Let me shade it in like this.

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:54.190
So it has less of it.

00:00:54.190 --> 00:00:57.610
And let's say solution number
2 has more of the solute.

00:00:57.610 --> 00:00:59.050
So it's more.

00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:02.050
So I'll just kind of represent
that as more

00:01:02.050 --> 00:01:03.700
closely packed lines.

00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:06.320
So the concentration of the
solute is higher here.

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:07.900
So let me write higher
concentration.

00:01:13.870 --> 00:01:19.570
And let's say this is a
lower concentration.

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:23.020
Now let's think about what will
happen if we shine some

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:25.710
light through each
of these beakers.

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:29.530
And let's just assume that we
are shining at a wavelength of

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:35.630
light that is specifically
sensitive to the solute that

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:37.340
we have dissolved in here.

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:39.950
I'll just leave that pretty
general right now.

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:43.430
So let's say I have some light
here of some intensity.

00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:48.510
So let's just call that the
incident intensity.

00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:50.070
I'll say that's I0.

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:51.760
So it's some intensity.

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:55.790
What's going to happen as the
light exits the other side of

00:01:55.790 --> 00:01:57.260
this beaker right here?

00:01:57.260 --> 00:02:00.510
Well, some of it is going
to be at absorbed.

00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:03.320
Some of this light, at certain
frequencies, is going to be

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:07.150
absorbed by our little molecules
inside the beaker.

00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:09.880
And so you're actually going to
have less light coming out

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:10.509
from the other side.

00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:13.700
Especially less of those
specific frequencies that

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:18.210
these molecules in here
like to absorb.

00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:20.635
So your're going to have less
light come out the other side.

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:27.770
I'll call this I1.

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:30.400
Now in this situation, if we
shine the same amount of

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:39.480
light-- so I0-- that's supposed
to be an arrow there,

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:41.730
but my arrow is kind
of degrading.

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:46.270
If we shined the same amount of
light into this beaker-- so

00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:48.550
it's the same number, that and
that is the same-- the same

00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:50.460
intensity of light, what's
going to happen?

00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:53.990
Well more of those specific
frequencies of light are going

00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:57.040
to be absorbed as the light
travels through this beaker.

00:02:57.040 --> 00:03:00.710
It's just going to bump into
more molecules because it's a

00:03:00.710 --> 00:03:02.310
higher concentration here.

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:05.210
So the light that comes out
when you have a higher

00:03:05.210 --> 00:03:10.780
concentration-- I'll call the
intensity I2-- this is going

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:14.920
to have a lower intensity of
light that's being transmitted

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:16.050
than this one over here.

00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:20.360
In this case, I2 is going to
have a lower intensity, is

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:22.270
going to be less than I1.

00:03:22.270 --> 00:03:24.560
And hopefully, that makes
intuitive sense.

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:27.920
These light, if you imagine,
photons are just going to bump

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:29.080
into more molecules.

00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:31.130
They're going to be absorbed
by more molecules.

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:34.330
So there'll be fewer that make
it through than these right

00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:37.320
here, because here it is
less concentrated.

00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:41.380
It's also the case if the
beaker was thicker.

00:03:45.350 --> 00:03:47.260
Let me draw another beaker.

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:53.730
If you have another beaker that
is maybe twice as wide,

00:03:53.730 --> 00:03:56.580
and let's say it has the same
concentration as number 1.

00:03:56.580 --> 00:04:00.130
We'll call this one number 3.

00:04:00.130 --> 00:04:04.110
It has the same concentration
as number 2, so I'll try to

00:04:04.110 --> 00:04:08.285
make it look fairly
similar to this.

00:04:08.285 --> 00:04:12.490
And you were to shine
some light in here.

00:04:12.490 --> 00:04:15.240
Generally you want to focus on
the frequencies that this is

00:04:15.240 --> 00:04:16.750
the best at absorbing.

00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:19.310
But let's say you shine the
same light in here.

00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:22.360
And you have some light that
makes it through, that exits.

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:25.140
And this is actually what
your eyes would see.

00:04:25.140 --> 00:04:28.130
So this is I3 right
there, what do you

00:04:28.130 --> 00:04:29.160
think is going to happen?

00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:31.780
Well it's the same
concentration, but this light

00:04:31.780 --> 00:04:33.710
has to travel a further
distance to that

00:04:33.710 --> 00:04:34.590
concentration.

00:04:34.590 --> 00:04:39.080
So once again, it's going to
bump into more molecules and

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:40.650
more of it will be absorbed.

00:04:40.650 --> 00:04:43.030
And so less light will
be transmitted.

00:04:43.030 --> 00:04:48.150
So I2 is less than I1, and I3
is actually going to be the

00:04:48.150 --> 00:04:48.660
least.

00:04:48.660 --> 00:04:51.180
And if you were looking at
these, this has the least

00:04:51.180 --> 00:04:53.120
light, this has a little bit
more light being transmitted,

00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:55.430
this has the most light
being transmitted.

00:04:55.430 --> 00:04:57.300
So if you were to look at
this, if you placed your

00:04:57.300 --> 00:05:03.820
eyeball right here-- those are
eyelashes-- this one right

00:05:03.820 --> 00:05:05.620
here would have the
lightest color.

00:05:05.620 --> 00:05:07.800
You're getting the most
light into your eye.

00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:10.330
This would be a slightly darker
color, and this would

00:05:10.330 --> 00:05:11.420
be the darkest color.

00:05:11.420 --> 00:05:12.700
That makes complete sense.

00:05:12.700 --> 00:05:15.300
If you dissolve something, if
you dissolve a little bit of

00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:17.180
something in water, it will
still be pretty transparent.

00:05:17.180 --> 00:05:19.920
If you dissolve a lot of
something in water, it'll be

00:05:19.920 --> 00:05:20.760
more opaque.

00:05:20.760 --> 00:05:23.270
And if the cup that you're
dissolving in, or the beaker

00:05:23.270 --> 00:05:25.250
that you're in gets
even longer, it'll

00:05:25.250 --> 00:05:26.890
get even more opaque.

00:05:26.890 --> 00:05:29.810
So hopefully that gives you
the intuition behind

00:05:29.810 --> 00:05:31.340
spectrophotometry.

00:05:31.340 --> 00:05:33.770
And so the next question is,
well what is it even good for?

00:05:33.770 --> 00:05:34.950
Why would I even care?

00:05:34.950 --> 00:05:37.400
Well you could actually
use this information.

00:05:37.400 --> 00:05:40.460
You could see how much light is
transmitted versus how much

00:05:40.460 --> 00:05:42.590
you put in to actually
figure out the

00:05:42.590 --> 00:05:43.880
concentration of a solution.

00:05:43.880 --> 00:05:45.510
That's why we're even
talking about it

00:05:45.510 --> 00:05:47.710
in a chemistry context.

00:05:47.710 --> 00:05:50.150
So before we do that-- and I'll
show you an example of

00:05:50.150 --> 00:05:54.920
that in the next video-- let me
just define some terms of

00:05:54.920 --> 00:05:57.230
ways of measuring how
concentrated this is.

00:05:57.230 --> 00:06:00.370
Or ways of measuring how much
light is transmitted versus

00:06:00.370 --> 00:06:02.170
how much was put in.

00:06:02.170 --> 00:06:05.666
So the first thing I will
define is transmittance.

00:06:11.170 --> 00:06:13.510
And so when the people who
defined it said, well you

00:06:13.510 --> 00:06:15.790
know, what we care about is how
much is transmitted versus

00:06:15.790 --> 00:06:16.810
how much went in.

00:06:16.810 --> 00:06:22.680
So let's just define
transmittance as that ratio,

00:06:22.680 --> 00:06:25.830
the amount that gets through.

00:06:25.830 --> 00:06:28.380
So in this example, the
transmittance of number 1

00:06:28.380 --> 00:06:35.990
would be the amount that got
through over the amount that

00:06:35.990 --> 00:06:37.030
you put in.

00:06:37.030 --> 00:06:41.150
Over here, the transmittance
would be the amount that you

00:06:41.150 --> 00:06:43.950
got out over the amount
that you put in.

00:06:43.950 --> 00:06:47.740
And as we see, this one right
here will be a lower number.

00:06:47.740 --> 00:06:49.860
I2 is lower than I1.

00:06:49.860 --> 00:06:53.510
So this will have a lower
transmittance than number 1.

00:06:53.510 --> 00:06:55.330
So let's call this
transmittance 2.

00:06:55.330 --> 00:06:56.930
This is transmittance 1.

00:06:56.930 --> 00:07:01.870
And transmittance 3 is the light
that comes out, that

00:07:01.870 --> 00:07:05.080
gets through, over the
light that goes in.

00:07:05.080 --> 00:07:07.180
And this is the smallest number,
followed by that,

00:07:07.180 --> 00:07:08.100
followed by that.

00:07:08.100 --> 00:07:10.610
So this will have the least
transmittance-- it's the most

00:07:10.610 --> 00:07:12.980
opaque-- followed by that,
followed by that.

00:07:12.980 --> 00:07:16.500
Now another definition-- which
was really kind of a

00:07:16.500 --> 00:07:19.230
derivative of the-- not in the
calculus sense, this is just

00:07:19.230 --> 00:07:22.340
derived from transmittance and
we'll see it has pretty neat

00:07:22.340 --> 00:07:24.110
properties-- is the notion
of absorbance.

00:07:26.640 --> 00:07:28.450
And so here, we're trying
to measure how

00:07:28.450 --> 00:07:29.500
good is it at absorbing?

00:07:29.500 --> 00:07:31.330
This is measuring how good
are you at transmitting?

00:07:31.330 --> 00:07:33.230
A higher number says your
transmitting a lot.

00:07:33.230 --> 00:07:35.670
But absorbance is how good
you're absorbing.

00:07:35.670 --> 00:07:36.790
So it's kind of the opposite.

00:07:36.790 --> 00:07:38.120
If you're good at transmitting,
that means

00:07:38.120 --> 00:07:40.510
you're bad at absorbing, you
don't have a lot to absorb.

00:07:40.510 --> 00:07:42.620
If you're good at absorbing,
that means you're not

00:07:42.620 --> 00:07:43.760
transmitting much.

00:07:43.760 --> 00:07:48.190
So absorbance right here.

00:07:48.190 --> 00:07:57.085
And that is defined as the
negative log of transmittance.

00:07:59.620 --> 00:08:02.560
And this logarithm is base 10.

00:08:02.560 --> 00:08:05.140
Or you could view that, the
transmittance we've already

00:08:05.140 --> 00:08:12.040
defined, as the negative log
of the light that is

00:08:12.040 --> 00:08:21.250
transmitted over the light
that is input.

00:08:21.250 --> 00:08:23.165
But the easiest way is the
negative log of the

00:08:23.165 --> 00:08:23.560
transmittance.

00:08:23.560 --> 00:08:26.820
So if transmittance is a large
number, absorbance is a small

00:08:26.820 --> 00:08:27.835
number, which makes sense.

00:08:27.835 --> 00:08:30.570
If you're transmitting a lot
of light, the absorbance

00:08:30.570 --> 00:08:32.409
number's going to be very small,
which means you're not

00:08:32.409 --> 00:08:34.000
absorbing that much.

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:36.210
If transmittance is a low
number, that means you're

00:08:36.210 --> 00:08:37.070
absorbing a lot.

00:08:37.070 --> 00:08:39.159
And so this will actually
be a large number.

00:08:39.159 --> 00:08:41.390
And that's what the negative
log gives us.

00:08:41.390 --> 00:08:43.809
Now what's also cool about this
is, there's something

00:08:43.809 --> 00:08:47.980
called the Beer-Lambert law,
which you could verify.

00:08:47.980 --> 00:08:53.596
We'll actually use this
in the next video, the

00:08:53.596 --> 00:08:56.630
Beer-Lambert law.

00:08:56.630 --> 00:08:59.190
I actually don't know the
history of where it came from.

00:08:59.190 --> 00:09:01.420
And I'm sure it's based on
somebody named Beer, but I

00:09:01.420 --> 00:09:03.880
always imagined it's based on
someone transmitting light

00:09:03.880 --> 00:09:04.720
through beer.

00:09:04.720 --> 00:09:15.870
The Beer-Lambert law tells
us that the absorbance is

00:09:15.870 --> 00:09:20.300
proportional-- I should write it
like this-- the absorbance

00:09:20.300 --> 00:09:25.730
is proportional to the path
length-- so this would be how

00:09:25.730 --> 00:09:28.170
far does the light have to
go through the solution.

00:09:28.170 --> 00:09:31.930
So it's proportional to the
path length times the

00:09:31.930 --> 00:09:34.395
concentration.

00:09:34.395 --> 00:09:38.470
And usually, we use molarity
for the concentration.

00:09:38.470 --> 00:09:42.600
Or another way to say it is that
the absorbance is equal

00:09:42.600 --> 00:09:45.710
to some constant-- it's usually
a lowercase epsilon

00:09:45.710 --> 00:09:50.540
like that-- and this is
dependent on the solution, or

00:09:50.540 --> 00:09:53.370
the solute in question, what we
actually have in here, and

00:09:53.370 --> 00:09:55.300
the temperature, and the
pressure, and all of that.

00:09:55.300 --> 00:09:59.090
Well it's equal to some
constant, times the length it

00:09:59.090 --> 00:10:03.120
has to travel, times
the concentration.

00:10:03.120 --> 00:10:04.300
Let me make it clear
right here.

00:10:04.300 --> 00:10:07.610
This thing right here
is concentration.

00:10:11.190 --> 00:10:15.920
And the reason why this is
super useful is, you can

00:10:15.920 --> 00:10:21.270
imagine, if you have something
of a known concentration-- let

00:10:21.270 --> 00:10:22.870
me draw right here.

00:10:22.870 --> 00:10:27.525
So let's say we have an axis
right here, that's axis.

00:10:27.525 --> 00:10:31.730
And over here I'm measuring
concentration.

00:10:31.730 --> 00:10:33.340
This is our concentration
axis.

00:10:35.940 --> 00:10:37.440
And we're measuring
it as molarity.

00:10:37.440 --> 00:10:39.880
And let's say the molarity
starts at 0.

00:10:39.880 --> 00:10:46.900
It goes, I don't know, 0.1, 0.2,
0.3, so on and so forth.

00:10:46.900 --> 00:10:50.210
And over here you're measuring
absorbance, in the vertical

00:10:50.210 --> 00:10:53.160
axis you measure absorbance.

00:10:53.160 --> 00:10:57.470
You measure absorbance
just like that.

00:10:57.470 --> 00:11:01.240
Now let's say you have some
solution and you know the

00:11:01.240 --> 00:11:05.050
concentration, you know it is
a 0.1 molar concentration.

00:11:05.050 --> 00:11:07.500
So let me write down
M for molar.

00:11:07.500 --> 00:11:09.390
And you measure its absorbance,
and you just get

00:11:09.390 --> 00:11:10.210
some number here.

00:11:10.210 --> 00:11:13.280
So you measure its absorbance
and you get its absorbance.

00:11:13.280 --> 00:11:14.990
So this is a low concentration,
it didn't

00:11:14.990 --> 00:11:16.040
absorb that much.

00:11:16.040 --> 00:11:18.250
You get, I don't know,
some number here, so

00:11:18.250 --> 00:11:23.460
let's say it's 0.25.

00:11:23.460 --> 00:11:26.920
And then, let's say that you
then take another known

00:11:26.920 --> 00:11:29.890
concentration, let's
say 0.2 molar.

00:11:29.890 --> 00:11:33.520
And you say that, oh look, it
has an absorbance of 0.5.

00:11:33.520 --> 00:11:35.100
So let me do that in
a different color.

00:11:35.100 --> 00:11:39.470
It has an absorbance,
right here, at 0.5.

00:11:39.470 --> 00:11:42.920
And I should put a 0 in front
of these, 0.5 and 0.25.

00:11:42.920 --> 00:11:45.860
What this tells you, this is
a linear relationship.

00:11:45.860 --> 00:11:49.820
That for any concentration,
the absorbance is

00:11:49.820 --> 00:11:51.620
going to be on a line.

00:11:51.620 --> 00:11:54.190
And if you want a little
review of algebra, this

00:11:54.190 --> 00:11:58.110
epsilon is actually going to
be the slope of that line.

00:11:58.110 --> 00:11:59.620
Well actually, the
epsilon times the

00:11:59.620 --> 00:12:00.510
length will be the slope.

00:12:00.510 --> 00:12:02.270
I don't want to confuse
you too much.

00:12:02.270 --> 00:12:04.870
But the important thing
to realize is that

00:12:04.870 --> 00:12:06.120
you have a line here.

00:12:08.870 --> 00:12:10.560
And the reason that's useful
is-- you could use a little

00:12:10.560 --> 00:12:12.310
bit of algebra to figure out
the equation of the line.

00:12:12.310 --> 00:12:15.120
Or you could just look at it
graphically and say, OK, I had

00:12:15.120 --> 00:12:18.240
two known concentrations and I
was able to figure out the

00:12:18.240 --> 00:12:23.750
absorbance because I know that
it's a linear relationship,

00:12:23.750 --> 00:12:24.830
the Beer-Lambert law.

00:12:24.830 --> 00:12:26.390
And if you just kept taking
measurements, it would all

00:12:26.390 --> 00:12:28.280
show up along this line.

00:12:28.280 --> 00:12:30.650
You can then go the
other way around.

00:12:30.650 --> 00:12:34.140
You could then measure for some
unknown concentration.

00:12:34.140 --> 00:12:35.510
You could figure out
its absorbance.

00:12:35.510 --> 00:12:37.520
So let's say there's some
unknown concentration, and you

00:12:37.520 --> 00:12:41.040
figure out its absorbance
is right over here.

00:12:41.040 --> 00:12:44.710
Let's say it's 0.4, it has
an absorbance of 0.4.

00:12:44.710 --> 00:12:46.870
Then you can just go on this
line right here, and you say

00:12:46.870 --> 00:12:51.920
OK, well then that must be a
concentration of whatever

00:12:51.920 --> 00:12:52.740
number this is.

00:12:52.740 --> 00:12:56.070
Then you could measure it, or
you can actually figure it out

00:12:56.070 --> 00:12:56.550
algebraically.

00:12:56.550 --> 00:12:59.680
And so this will be pretty
close to 0.2 molar, or a

00:12:59.680 --> 00:13:01.470
little bit less than
0.2 molar.

00:13:01.470 --> 00:13:02.770
And we're going to actually
do an example of

00:13:02.770 --> 00:13:05.460
that in the next video.
