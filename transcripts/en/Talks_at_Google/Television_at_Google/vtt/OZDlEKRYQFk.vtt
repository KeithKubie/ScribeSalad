00:00:05.602 --> 00:00:07.560
MARC DE SCHWEINITZ:
Welcome to Talks At Google.

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:09.145
I'm here with
comedian Brian Regan.

00:00:09.145 --> 00:00:10.270
BRIAN REGAN: Hi, everybody.

00:00:10.270 --> 00:00:11.110
MARC DE SCHWEINITZ: Give
him a round of applause.

00:00:11.110 --> 00:00:11.776
BRIAN REGAN: Hi.

00:00:11.776 --> 00:00:12.737
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:14.972 --> 00:00:16.259
I haven't done anything yet.

00:00:16.259 --> 00:00:17.050
But I'll take that.

00:00:17.050 --> 00:00:17.550
Thank you.

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:18.355
[LAUGHTER]

00:00:18.355 --> 00:00:19.730
MARC DE SCHWEINITZ:
Yeah, Brian's

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:21.810
been touring all over the
country in the Midwest

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:23.310
here for a little while.

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:26.241
He was gracious enough to stop
by Google for your first visit,

00:00:26.241 --> 00:00:27.240
I understand, to Google.

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:27.610
BRIAN REGAN: Yes.

00:00:27.610 --> 00:00:28.060
Yes.

00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:29.310
MARC DE SCHWEINITZ: All right.

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:30.105
Do you use Google?

00:00:30.105 --> 00:00:31.200
BRIAN REGAN: I don't
know what it is.

00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:31.550
[LAUGHTER]

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:32.250
MARC DE SCHWEINITZ:
You know what it is.

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:33.375
BRIAN REGAN: No, of course.

00:00:33.375 --> 00:00:35.700
Yes, I use Google quite often.

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:38.010
Years ago when I first
had the internet,

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:42.490
I was amazed that you could find
something with a search engine.

00:00:42.490 --> 00:00:45.330
So the first one I
used was Ask Jeeves.

00:00:45.330 --> 00:00:46.830
MARC DE SCHWEINITZ:
I've used that--

00:00:46.830 --> 00:00:48.900
BRIAN REGAN: I don't know
if that exists anymore.

00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:52.210
And then, somebody said
you should try Google.

00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:53.970
And this was years back.

00:00:53.970 --> 00:00:55.160
And I was like, Google?

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:56.130
So then, I did Google.

00:00:56.130 --> 00:00:59.320
And of course, it's so much
more efficient than Ask Jeeves.

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:01.570
MARC DE SCHWEINITZ: Well
thank you for the compliment.

00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:02.205
[LAUGHTER]

00:01:02.205 --> 00:01:03.282
No, that's wonderful.

00:01:03.282 --> 00:01:03.990
BRIAN REGAN: Yes.

00:01:03.990 --> 00:01:04.769
MARC DE SCHWEINITZ:
Can you teach us

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:07.465
a little bit about your
comedy through some questions

00:01:07.465 --> 00:01:08.340
I'm going to ask you?

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:11.730
I'm taking an online class
from Steve Martin now, a master

00:01:11.730 --> 00:01:12.570
class.

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:16.302
So can we turn this into a mini
master class from Brian Regan?

00:01:16.302 --> 00:01:17.760
BRIAN REGAN: Yes,
but I'm not going

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:20.520
to be able to top anything that
Steve Martin has instructed

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:21.020
you.

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:21.920
[LAUGHTER]

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:24.701
MARC DE SCHWEINITZ: He was
part of your inspiration.

00:01:24.701 --> 00:01:25.200
Correct?

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:25.950
BRIAN REGAN: Yeah.

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:29.160
I was always a big
Steve Martin fan.

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:30.750
Even before I wanted
to be a comedian,

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:34.300
I just I loved his comedy.

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:34.890
Very silly.

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:39.090
His character was silly, but
the comedian was very smart.

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:40.530
So you laughed on two levels.

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:42.090
It was a double barrel thing.

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:44.735
You laughed at the
goofiness of the character,

00:01:44.735 --> 00:01:46.110
but you laughed
at the brilliance

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:47.475
of the guy who created it.

00:01:47.475 --> 00:01:50.380
MARC DE SCHWEINITZ:
That's very rare to find.

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:52.870
BRIAN REGAN: But with
my kind of comedy,

00:01:52.870 --> 00:01:54.330
I just lacked the
brilliant part.

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:54.900
People just--

00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:57.060
[LAUGHTER]

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:59.500
--laugh at the goofiness of
the character and that's it.

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:00.870
MARC DE SCHWEINITZ: Oh, come on.

00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:03.690
Well let's take it back to
when you were maybe a child.

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:05.700
Were you funny as a kid?

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:08.280
Did you make people laugh
at dinner parties, things

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:10.084
like that?

00:02:10.084 --> 00:02:11.750
BRIAN REGAN: Well not
at dinner parties.

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:14.310
I was kind of shy.

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:17.970
I would make my close friends
laugh and my family laugh.

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:21.060
But if I was in school
or something like that,

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:25.230
I was a little afraid to put
myself out there, you know.

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:27.660
One of the first time I
remember getting a laugh

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:29.910
was inadvertently.

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:32.920
I was in a car with our family.

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:35.970
And we were passing
a funeral procession.

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:40.500
And I asked my dad if he had
ever seen a real live dead man.

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:41.271
And uh--

00:02:41.271 --> 00:02:43.680
[LAUGHTER]

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:46.050
I wasn't even
trying to be funny.

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:48.300
And my dad laughed
for like 20 minutes.

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:50.342
And I'm like, what just
happened there, you know.

00:02:50.342 --> 00:02:51.883
And then, I put it
together and I was

00:02:51.883 --> 00:02:53.340
like, oh, that makes no sense.

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:55.740
And so I started thinking,
oh, those kind of things

00:02:55.740 --> 00:02:56.820
get reactions.

00:02:56.820 --> 00:02:58.110
MARC DE SCHWEINITZ: Right.

00:02:58.110 --> 00:03:00.960
The things kids say can be
pretty brilliant sometimes.

00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:02.270
BRIAN REGAN: Yeah, or dumb.

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:03.436
MARC DE SCHWEINITZ: Or dumb.

00:03:03.436 --> 00:03:04.810
Yeah, both.

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:07.470
And you went to college
in Ohio, I understand.

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:08.490
Heidelberg College.

00:03:08.490 --> 00:03:10.497
BRIAN REGAN: Heidelberg
College in Tiffin, Ohio.

00:03:10.497 --> 00:03:11.580
Has anybody heard of that?

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:13.005
AUDIENCE: No

00:03:13.005 --> 00:03:13.729
[LAUGHTER]

00:03:13.729 --> 00:03:15.270
BRIAN REGAN: I didn't
even hear of it

00:03:15.270 --> 00:03:17.140
until my sophomore, junior year.

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:18.780
[LAUGHTER]

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:19.670
Very small school.

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:22.590
It is now a university.

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:25.470
My college graduated
before I did.

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:27.780
They went from a
college to a university.

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:30.360
I wish they still call
themselves a college.

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:32.570
I thought that was
quainter and all that.

00:03:32.570 --> 00:03:37.440
But yeah, I went there for
longer than I should have.

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:42.420
And I ended up dropping out of
college to try stand-up comedy.

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:43.770
MARC DE SCHWEINITZ: OK.

00:03:43.770 --> 00:03:45.730
And you went to college
to play football.

00:03:45.730 --> 00:03:46.540
Is that correct?

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:46.970
BRIAN REGAN: Yes.

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:47.928
MARC DE SCHWEINITZ: OK.

00:03:47.928 --> 00:03:50.827
And what brought you over
to the comedy passion?

00:03:50.827 --> 00:03:53.160
BRIAN REGAN: I think after
two days of playing football,

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:54.938
the coach took me
aside and went, hm.

00:03:54.938 --> 00:03:56.890
[LAUGHTER]

00:03:56.890 --> 00:03:59.130
There might be something
you're more qualified for.

00:03:59.130 --> 00:04:00.660
[LAUGHTER]

00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:03.190
No, actually, I was a pretty
decent football player.

00:04:03.190 --> 00:04:07.860
And I went to college thinking
I was going to be an accountant.

00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:11.430
And after some
accounting classes,

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:14.130
my eyes would glaze over
in the back of my head,

00:04:14.130 --> 00:04:16.110
like, I just can't do this.

00:04:16.110 --> 00:04:19.800
And I went and I talked to
my college football coach.

00:04:19.800 --> 00:04:23.790
And I said, I'm kind
of disillusioned.

00:04:23.790 --> 00:04:25.360
I said, I love playing football.

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:29.760
But I don't know why I'm here
academically or whatever.

00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:33.394
And he said, you're
a pretty funny guy.

00:04:33.394 --> 00:04:35.310
You make everybody laugh
on the football team.

00:04:35.310 --> 00:04:35.970
[LAUGHTER]

00:04:35.970 --> 00:04:38.410
I don't know if that
was a compliment or not.

00:04:38.410 --> 00:04:40.350
And he said, you
might want to consider

00:04:40.350 --> 00:04:43.200
the communication in
theater arts department,

00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:47.280
which when I was a kid was,
like, a million miles away

00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:49.710
from anything I would
have ever even considered.

00:04:49.710 --> 00:04:51.540
I wasn't like a
narrow minded jock.

00:04:51.540 --> 00:04:53.880
But that was not
part of my world.

00:04:56.430 --> 00:04:59.670
So I switched majors.

00:04:59.670 --> 00:05:02.670
One of my first classes
was a speech class.

00:05:02.670 --> 00:05:05.880
And I used to try to
make my speeches funny.

00:05:05.880 --> 00:05:09.680
They were a class
about this size.

00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:13.550
And when I got the class
laughing, it was like--

00:05:13.550 --> 00:05:16.010
and more importantly,
we had a teacher,

00:05:16.010 --> 00:05:19.070
this heavyset woman who
sat in the back, who

00:05:19.070 --> 00:05:22.520
would howl at my speeches.

00:05:22.520 --> 00:05:27.560
And I never had a teacher
like anything I did ever.

00:05:27.560 --> 00:05:31.160
And to have this teacher
be into what I did,

00:05:31.160 --> 00:05:34.310
and plus getting
the class laughing,

00:05:34.310 --> 00:05:37.280
I remember walking back to
the dorm after these speeches.

00:05:37.280 --> 00:05:41.300
And I was, like,
walking on a cloud, man.

00:05:41.300 --> 00:05:43.310
I was like, whatever that--

00:05:43.310 --> 00:05:46.147
I don't feel like this when I
walk back from biology class,

00:05:46.147 --> 00:05:46.647
you know.

00:05:46.647 --> 00:05:48.080
[LAUGHTER]

00:05:48.080 --> 00:05:51.140
So I knew whatever that
was, I needed that.

00:05:51.140 --> 00:05:53.162
I needed that in my life.

00:05:53.162 --> 00:05:54.620
MARC DE SCHWEINITZ:
That's awesome.

00:05:54.620 --> 00:05:57.410
Were you very physical in
your comedy like you are now?

00:05:57.410 --> 00:06:01.910
Was it drawn out facial
expressions and physicality?

00:06:01.910 --> 00:06:05.570
BRIAN REGAN: When I first
started, I tried everything.

00:06:05.570 --> 00:06:08.270
I mean, I just threw
everything at the wall

00:06:08.270 --> 00:06:09.420
to see what would stick.

00:06:09.420 --> 00:06:11.720
You know, I didn't know
where to come from.

00:06:11.720 --> 00:06:14.390
I even had props.

00:06:14.390 --> 00:06:17.210
But I had props that
I didn't even need.

00:06:17.210 --> 00:06:22.640
I was so bad at being
a prop comedian.

00:06:22.640 --> 00:06:24.710
Like, I would talk
about a product.

00:06:24.710 --> 00:06:29.810
I did a joke about a cereal
called 40% Bran Flakes.

00:06:29.810 --> 00:06:34.370
And I would say, hey, have
you guys seen that cereal 40%

00:06:34.370 --> 00:06:34.970
Bran Flakes?

00:06:34.970 --> 00:06:37.370
And then, I pulled it out
of a bag and showed it--

00:06:37.370 --> 00:06:38.369
[LAUGHTER]

00:06:38.369 --> 00:06:40.160
MARC DE SCHWEINITZ:
You brought the flakes.

00:06:40.160 --> 00:06:41.050
BRIAN REGAN: --to the audience.

00:06:41.050 --> 00:06:43.680
And they're probably like, we
know what it looks like, buddy,

00:06:43.680 --> 00:06:44.180
you know.

00:06:44.180 --> 00:06:45.440
[LAUGHTER]

00:06:46.530 --> 00:06:48.280
MARC DE SCHWEINITZ:
Sounds like it worked.

00:06:48.280 --> 00:06:49.200
BRIAN REGAN: Yeah.

00:06:49.200 --> 00:06:51.560
I had a bag of
unnecessary props.

00:06:51.560 --> 00:06:53.270
I was the unnecessary
prop comic.

00:06:53.270 --> 00:06:54.176
[LAUGHTER]

00:06:54.176 --> 00:06:57.020
And I thought, just
saying 40% Bran Flakes is

00:06:57.020 --> 00:06:58.580
enough for these people.

00:06:58.580 --> 00:06:59.780
Anyway.

00:06:59.780 --> 00:07:02.720
So I tried everything.

00:07:02.720 --> 00:07:05.620
The face stuff though, I never
really thought about that.

00:07:05.620 --> 00:07:06.600
That just, kind of,
came along the way.

00:07:06.600 --> 00:07:08.225
MARC DE SCHWEINITZ:
Just comes natural.

00:07:08.225 --> 00:07:09.140
Great.

00:07:09.140 --> 00:07:11.210
Were your parents
supportive of your decision

00:07:11.210 --> 00:07:12.040
to go into comedy?

00:07:12.040 --> 00:07:14.570
BRIAN REGAN: Um,
like I told you,

00:07:14.570 --> 00:07:18.110
I dropped out of
college to do it.

00:07:18.110 --> 00:07:23.210
I was 10 credit hours
away from graduating.

00:07:23.210 --> 00:07:25.310
Probably one of the
most challenging phone

00:07:25.310 --> 00:07:28.700
calls I ever had to
make to my mom and dad.

00:07:28.700 --> 00:07:34.950
And it felt, to me, like they
were probably hearing, hey,

00:07:34.950 --> 00:07:36.380
I want to join the circus.

00:07:36.380 --> 00:07:37.730
[LAUGHTER]

00:07:39.980 --> 00:07:42.710
But they were surprisingly cool.

00:07:42.710 --> 00:07:44.806
Cool in a good way.

00:07:44.806 --> 00:07:46.430
They said what most
parents should say.

00:07:46.430 --> 00:07:49.100
They were like, well, you're
so close to graduating.

00:07:49.100 --> 00:07:51.200
Maybe you should
get your degree,

00:07:51.200 --> 00:07:53.810
and then you could
pursue comedy.

00:07:53.810 --> 00:07:56.060
But it's your choice,
and whatever you do,

00:07:56.060 --> 00:07:56.859
we support you.

00:07:56.859 --> 00:07:58.400
MARC DE SCHWEINITZ:
That's wonderful.

00:07:58.400 --> 00:07:58.941
You're lucky.

00:07:58.941 --> 00:08:00.200
BRIAN REGAN: Yeah, I was.

00:08:00.200 --> 00:08:03.150
MARC DE SCHWEINITZ: From that
point on, did it work for you?

00:08:03.150 --> 00:08:07.414
Were you successful, from your
perspective, when you started?

00:08:07.414 --> 00:08:09.080
BRIAN REGAN: Well not
right off the bat.

00:08:09.080 --> 00:08:11.900
I mean, it takes a while.

00:08:11.900 --> 00:08:14.330
I started at this comedy
club in Fort Lauderdale.

00:08:14.330 --> 00:08:18.990
And you know, I
auditioned a few times.

00:08:18.990 --> 00:08:20.660
And then, when I
passed my audition,

00:08:20.660 --> 00:08:25.130
they would let me go on every
night at the end of the show.

00:08:25.130 --> 00:08:28.550
They don't do it like this at
any other club in the world

00:08:28.550 --> 00:08:29.570
that I know of.

00:08:29.570 --> 00:08:32.480
They would let the
local comedians go on

00:08:32.480 --> 00:08:34.523
after the good comedians.

00:08:34.523 --> 00:08:36.684
[LAUGHTER]

00:08:36.684 --> 00:08:38.600
MARC DE SCHWEINITZ: They
were opening for you.

00:08:38.600 --> 00:08:40.520
BRIAN REGAN: Yeah, they
were opening for us.

00:08:40.520 --> 00:08:46.610
And the club owner wanted
a clear line in the sand

00:08:46.610 --> 00:08:48.980
because he didn't want
the audience confused.

00:08:48.980 --> 00:08:51.090
So after the good
comedians were done,

00:08:51.090 --> 00:08:53.330
there were like
three co-headliners.

00:08:53.330 --> 00:08:56.490
Then, he would have the
MC go on stage and say,

00:08:56.490 --> 00:09:00.140
all right folks,
that's it for our show,

00:09:00.140 --> 00:09:02.210
meaning the good part
of the show is over.

00:09:02.210 --> 00:09:03.380
That's it for our show.

00:09:03.380 --> 00:09:06.231
We do have some local comedians
who are just getting started.

00:09:06.231 --> 00:09:08.480
If you'd like to hang around
to give them an audience,

00:09:08.480 --> 00:09:09.800
you're more than welcome to.

00:09:09.800 --> 00:09:12.290
So that was the environment
that we went up to.

00:09:12.290 --> 00:09:14.270
[LAUGHTER]

00:09:14.270 --> 00:09:17.480
So when I first started, I
was always going on stage

00:09:17.480 --> 00:09:20.240
to people walking out.

00:09:20.240 --> 00:09:24.920
And I developed a whole
routine about people leaving.

00:09:24.920 --> 00:09:25.880
And I would kill.

00:09:25.880 --> 00:09:30.320
I had this whole thing about
the doors going and you know.

00:09:30.320 --> 00:09:31.820
And then, I got
pretty good at that.

00:09:31.820 --> 00:09:33.740
And then, they bumped me up.

00:09:33.740 --> 00:09:36.200
They were gonna let me
open the show one time.

00:09:36.200 --> 00:09:38.156
And I get on stage
and I'm like--

00:09:38.156 --> 00:09:40.290
[LAUGHTER]

00:09:40.290 --> 00:09:41.367
Nobody's leaving!

00:09:41.367 --> 00:09:42.450
I didn't know what to say.

00:09:42.450 --> 00:09:42.660
MARC DE SCHWEINITZ:
You're not used

00:09:42.660 --> 00:09:43.910
to seeing the front of people.

00:09:43.910 --> 00:09:44.990
BRIAN REGAN: Yeah, they're
all looking at me, like,

00:09:44.990 --> 00:09:45.590
well go ahead.

00:09:45.590 --> 00:09:47.060
And I'm like, well
you got to go!

00:09:47.060 --> 00:09:49.670
[LAUGHTER]

00:09:49.670 --> 00:09:52.936
So then I had to learn how
to talk about other things.

00:09:52.936 --> 00:09:54.560
MARC DE SCHWEINITZ:
So from that point,

00:09:54.560 --> 00:09:56.810
did you start visiting
other comedy clubs

00:09:56.810 --> 00:09:58.250
once your confidence was up?

00:09:58.250 --> 00:09:58.970
You were--

00:09:58.970 --> 00:10:01.880
BRIAN REGAN: I worked at that
one comedy club for 2 1/2

00:10:01.880 --> 00:10:02.490
years.

00:10:02.490 --> 00:10:07.110
I went on, basically,
every single night.

00:10:07.110 --> 00:10:10.210
The guy who passed me,
he said, audition night

00:10:10.210 --> 00:10:12.940
was just Monday
night of each week.

00:10:12.940 --> 00:10:18.310
And when I passed auditions--
passed meaning I was approved--

00:10:18.310 --> 00:10:21.040
he said, you can go
on on other nights.

00:10:21.040 --> 00:10:23.410
And I said, I don't know
what the protocol is here.

00:10:23.410 --> 00:10:25.840
But what I be
abusing the privilege

00:10:25.840 --> 00:10:28.510
if I went on every single night?

00:10:28.510 --> 00:10:31.454
And he's like, I never
had anybody ask that.

00:10:31.454 --> 00:10:33.370
He goes, you want to go
on every single night?

00:10:33.370 --> 00:10:34.510
I said, if I can.

00:10:34.510 --> 00:10:35.110
He goes, sure.

00:10:35.110 --> 00:10:37.800
So I went on every single
night for 2 and 1/2 years.

00:10:37.800 --> 00:10:40.180
And then, from then, I
went out on the road.

00:10:40.180 --> 00:10:42.947
And I was fortunate
that comedy exploded

00:10:42.947 --> 00:10:45.280
right around the time I was
ready to go out on the road.

00:10:45.280 --> 00:10:48.110
Comedy clubs started opening
all around the country.

00:10:48.110 --> 00:10:51.700
So I just was able
to ride that wave.

00:10:51.700 --> 00:10:55.640
I was able to get gigs not
because I was any good.

00:10:55.640 --> 00:10:57.470
Comedy clubs needed comedians.

00:10:57.470 --> 00:11:01.550
If you could stand on stage
for 30 minutes without melting,

00:11:01.550 --> 00:11:02.540
you could work.

00:11:02.540 --> 00:11:03.890
[LAUGHTER]

00:11:03.890 --> 00:11:07.135
So that was my pitch.

00:11:07.135 --> 00:11:08.510
MARC DE SCHWEINITZ:
Were you more

00:11:08.510 --> 00:11:10.640
dedicated than other
comedians if you

00:11:10.640 --> 00:11:11.900
wanted to go on every night?

00:11:11.900 --> 00:11:14.180
Do you feel like you're a
harder worker than, maybe,

00:11:14.180 --> 00:11:15.802
some other comedians?

00:11:15.802 --> 00:11:16.910
BRIAN REGAN: Yeah.

00:11:16.910 --> 00:11:18.990
Well I don't want to
pat myself on the back,

00:11:18.990 --> 00:11:20.930
but I sensed that at the time.

00:11:20.930 --> 00:11:23.480
I remember there were
other local guys that

00:11:23.480 --> 00:11:25.370
would look at the audience.

00:11:25.370 --> 00:11:26.870
And sometimes it
was a bad audience,

00:11:26.870 --> 00:11:29.420
it was a rough audience, and
they would pick and choose.

00:11:29.420 --> 00:11:31.670
And they would go, uh, I
don't want to go on tonight.

00:11:31.670 --> 00:11:35.780
And I'm like, I want
to go on every night.

00:11:35.780 --> 00:11:38.690
I want to learn every night.

00:11:38.690 --> 00:11:41.120
I want to learn
something, you know.

00:11:41.120 --> 00:11:45.540
If it's a bad audience, I don't
care if I get zero laughs.

00:11:45.540 --> 00:11:47.610
I'm going to learn something
from the experience.

00:11:47.610 --> 00:11:49.817
And then, I'll apply
that the next night I

00:11:49.817 --> 00:11:50.650
have a bad audience.

00:11:50.650 --> 00:11:52.350
MARC DE SCHWEINITZ:
Would that be

00:11:52.350 --> 00:11:55.110
one of your number one takeaways
for aspiring comedians?

00:11:55.110 --> 00:11:58.506
Go on as frequently as
possible, no matter what?

00:11:58.506 --> 00:11:59.950
BRIAN REGAN: That's one.

00:11:59.950 --> 00:12:02.100
Another thing I tell
people if they're just

00:12:02.100 --> 00:12:05.520
trying to get into
comedy is I always

00:12:05.520 --> 00:12:08.940
feel it's a mistake
to try to figure out

00:12:08.940 --> 00:12:12.120
what the audience finds funny.

00:12:12.120 --> 00:12:15.090
You should be saying
what you think is funny.

00:12:15.090 --> 00:12:19.170
You shouldn't be trying to
push buttons that get laughs.

00:12:19.170 --> 00:12:24.000
You should be sharing
what's in here with them.

00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:25.440
And if they agree, then great.

00:12:25.440 --> 00:12:26.250
That's you're act.

00:12:26.250 --> 00:12:27.330
You know what I mean?

00:12:27.330 --> 00:12:31.410
But once you cross that
line of, what do they want,

00:12:31.410 --> 00:12:32.520
then what's the point?

00:12:32.520 --> 00:12:34.437
You know, it seems
like a waste of time.

00:12:34.437 --> 00:12:35.520
MARC DE SCHWEINITZ: Mm hm.

00:12:35.520 --> 00:12:36.900
Picture yourself
in the audience.

00:12:36.900 --> 00:12:38.640
BRIAN REGAN: That's what I do.

00:12:38.640 --> 00:12:43.295
If I'm having a bad show,
I imagine myself sitting

00:12:43.295 --> 00:12:44.545
in the middle of the audience.

00:12:44.545 --> 00:12:45.200
MARC DE SCHWEINITZ:
Making yourself laugh.

00:12:45.200 --> 00:12:47.320
BRIAN REGAN: And then, I
could just make me laugh.

00:12:47.320 --> 00:12:50.856
[LAUGHTER]

00:12:50.856 --> 00:12:52.855
The problem is I usually
end up heckling myself.

00:12:52.855 --> 00:12:55.070
[LAUGHTER]

00:12:55.070 --> 00:12:57.110
You stink.

00:12:57.110 --> 00:12:59.980
But anyway because I
know I can do that.

00:12:59.980 --> 00:13:01.810
I know I can make me laugh.

00:13:01.810 --> 00:13:04.030
I'm not qualified to
make a roomful of people

00:13:04.030 --> 00:13:05.050
laugh all the time.

00:13:05.050 --> 00:13:06.850
But I know what
I think is funny.

00:13:06.850 --> 00:13:10.270
So it calms me down to
go, well, this I can do.

00:13:10.270 --> 00:13:12.420
Clearly, I can't figure
out what these people are--

00:13:12.420 --> 00:13:13.251
[LAUGHTER]

00:13:13.251 --> 00:13:13.750
So.

00:13:13.750 --> 00:13:14.800
MARC DE SCHWEINITZ: Well
you must have something

00:13:14.800 --> 00:13:17.800
in common with us because a
lot of us are laughing too.

00:13:17.800 --> 00:13:20.590
BRIAN REGAN: Well I mean,
I get fortunate that some

00:13:20.590 --> 00:13:23.488
of the things I think of other
people also think is funny.

00:13:23.488 --> 00:13:25.480
[LAUGHTER]

00:13:25.480 --> 00:13:27.924
Hence, this career.

00:13:27.924 --> 00:13:29.590
MARC DE SCHWEINITZ:
Tell us a little bit

00:13:29.590 --> 00:13:30.970
about the writing process.

00:13:30.970 --> 00:13:32.740
How do you come up
with new material?

00:13:32.740 --> 00:13:35.260
How much time do
you spend on it?

00:13:35.260 --> 00:13:38.610
BRIAN REGAN: I
always like to write.

00:13:38.610 --> 00:13:41.719
that's one of my favorite
things is doing new stuff.

00:13:41.719 --> 00:13:43.510
I was just talking to
the guy I was working

00:13:43.510 --> 00:13:46.480
with this last weekend because
I was going to be doing

00:13:46.480 --> 00:13:47.770
some new stuff in my show.

00:13:47.770 --> 00:13:52.150
And I said, that's my favorite
moment coming up to a bit

00:13:52.150 --> 00:13:56.530
that it's like running
on virgin snow.

00:13:56.530 --> 00:13:58.750
You know, you're
making new footprints,

00:13:58.750 --> 00:14:01.850
and you don't know
what's going to happen.

00:14:01.850 --> 00:14:03.730
You don't know if
they're going to laugh.

00:14:03.730 --> 00:14:07.900
If they do laugh, you don't know
where they're going to laugh.

00:14:07.900 --> 00:14:12.260
You're just starting a brand
new baby joke, you know.

00:14:12.260 --> 00:14:14.450
And it might get nothing.

00:14:14.450 --> 00:14:16.640
And there might be
nothing to it at all.

00:14:16.640 --> 00:14:18.520
But if there's something
there, then you

00:14:18.520 --> 00:14:21.170
get to do it night after
night, and play with it,

00:14:21.170 --> 00:14:23.790
massage it, and get
it better and tighter.

00:14:23.790 --> 00:14:25.810
And I just love the process.

00:14:25.810 --> 00:14:28.280
MARC DE SCHWEINITZ: Do you
have a test audience, friends,

00:14:28.280 --> 00:14:30.420
or anyone that you
run your jokes by?

00:14:30.420 --> 00:14:31.321
BRIAN REGAN: No.

00:14:31.321 --> 00:14:32.320
Always regular audience.

00:14:32.320 --> 00:14:33.530
MARC DE SCHWEINITZ:
Always live on stage?

00:14:33.530 --> 00:14:33.975
BRIAN REGAN: Yeah.

00:14:33.975 --> 00:14:34.420
Yeah.

00:14:34.420 --> 00:14:34.480
MARC DE SCHWEINITZ: OK.

00:14:34.480 --> 00:14:36.689
And you performed last
night in Toledo, correct?

00:14:36.689 --> 00:14:37.480
BRIAN REGAN: Mm hm.

00:14:37.480 --> 00:14:38.110
MARC DE SCHWEINITZ:
How did that go?

00:14:38.110 --> 00:14:39.674
BRIAN REGAN: Not
to show off but--

00:14:39.674 --> 00:14:41.610
[LAUGHTER]

00:14:43.062 --> 00:14:45.545
Yeah, I perform in
cities like Toledo.

00:14:45.545 --> 00:14:46.882
[LAUGHTER]

00:14:50.150 --> 00:14:51.590
Toledo's a cool place.

00:14:51.590 --> 00:14:53.300
I like performing everywhere.

00:14:53.300 --> 00:14:54.020
I really do.

00:14:54.020 --> 00:14:54.890
I like big cities.

00:14:54.890 --> 00:14:55.790
I like little cities.

00:14:55.790 --> 00:14:57.860
I like medium sized cities.

00:14:57.860 --> 00:15:03.923
Speaking of medium, my daughter,
when she was a little girl,

00:15:03.923 --> 00:15:08.360
this is when I realized that she
didn't quite know what I did.

00:15:08.360 --> 00:15:11.780
She said, daddy, I realized
I like three kinds of dogs.

00:15:11.780 --> 00:15:13.494
She was, like, five.

00:15:13.494 --> 00:15:14.660
And I said, oh, what's that?

00:15:14.660 --> 00:15:17.790
She goes, I like small dogs.

00:15:17.790 --> 00:15:20.450
I like large dogs.

00:15:20.450 --> 00:15:22.610
And I like comedian dogs.

00:15:22.610 --> 00:15:24.830
[LAUGHTER]

00:15:24.830 --> 00:15:28.140
And I thought, my daughter
thinks I'm a size.

00:15:28.140 --> 00:15:29.707
[LAUGHTER]

00:15:29.707 --> 00:15:30.915
MARC DE SCHWEINITZ: Oh, good.

00:15:30.915 --> 00:15:32.370
[LAUGHTER]

00:15:32.370 --> 00:15:33.830
BRIAN REGAN: Hm.

00:15:33.830 --> 00:15:34.640
So.

00:15:34.640 --> 00:15:36.431
MARC DE SCHWEINITZ:
Have you ever performed

00:15:36.431 --> 00:15:40.986
for kids at an
elementary school?

00:15:40.986 --> 00:15:42.930
BRIAN REGAN: Not really.

00:15:42.930 --> 00:15:47.650
I do perform where kids
are in the audience.

00:15:47.650 --> 00:15:50.530
It's a tricky thing.

00:15:50.530 --> 00:15:51.580
I hate the term.

00:15:51.580 --> 00:15:52.480
I hate the word.

00:15:52.480 --> 00:15:54.190
But there's no other
way to describe it.

00:15:54.190 --> 00:15:54.865
I work clean.

00:15:57.510 --> 00:15:59.850
But people get the wrong
idea when they hear the word.

00:15:59.850 --> 00:16:03.710
They attach a connotation
to it that I'm not a fan of,

00:16:03.710 --> 00:16:04.720
you know.

00:16:04.720 --> 00:16:08.020
They think it might be something
that they're not interested in.

00:16:08.020 --> 00:16:14.650
But because I work clean, people
will bring their kids sometimes

00:16:14.650 --> 00:16:16.210
to the audience.

00:16:16.210 --> 00:16:18.880
And that didn't happen until
I got out of comedy clubs

00:16:18.880 --> 00:16:21.330
and started playing in theaters
because in comedy clubs,

00:16:21.330 --> 00:16:25.139
you have to be 18 or 21,
depending on the state.

00:16:25.139 --> 00:16:27.180
And the first time I
started playing in theaters,

00:16:27.180 --> 00:16:31.840
I'm backstage, and people came
back, there's kids out there.

00:16:31.840 --> 00:16:33.300
And I'm like, really?

00:16:33.300 --> 00:16:37.480
And I had a CD
out that, I guess,

00:16:37.480 --> 00:16:40.090
had kid oriented jokes on it
about me playing Little League

00:16:40.090 --> 00:16:42.350
baseball and stuff like that.

00:16:42.350 --> 00:16:44.530
So I try to be
respectful of the fact

00:16:44.530 --> 00:16:46.870
that people might
bring younger people.

00:16:46.870 --> 00:16:50.615
But I also want to make it clear
that it's not a kiddie show.

00:16:50.615 --> 00:16:51.490
You know what I mean?

00:16:51.490 --> 00:16:54.080
I'm not twisting balloon
animals on stage.

00:16:54.080 --> 00:16:56.330
[LAUGHTER]

00:16:56.330 --> 00:16:58.330
Now I feel like I'm
making fun of people

00:16:58.330 --> 00:16:59.650
who twist balloon animals.

00:16:59.650 --> 00:17:00.940
MARC DE SCHWEINITZ: I
make balloon animals.

00:17:00.940 --> 00:17:02.481
BRIAN REGAN: It's
a wonderful career.

00:17:02.481 --> 00:17:03.814
[LAUGHTER]

00:17:03.814 --> 00:17:05.230
The reason I don't
do it is I just

00:17:05.230 --> 00:17:07.290
can't do it like you do it.

00:17:07.290 --> 00:17:07.854
It's a gift.

00:17:07.854 --> 00:17:09.270
MARC DE SCHWEINITZ:
That's better.

00:17:09.270 --> 00:17:10.530
BRIAN REGAN: So anyway.

00:17:10.530 --> 00:17:13.630
MARC DE SCHWEINITZ: Do you have
a favorite venue to perform at

00:17:13.630 --> 00:17:14.980
or a favorite show?

00:17:14.980 --> 00:17:17.648
I watched your Radio City
Music Hall as an example.

00:17:17.648 --> 00:17:19.564
Was that one of the
highlights of your career?

00:17:19.564 --> 00:17:21.130
BRIAN REGAN: That were
certainly a big thing

00:17:21.130 --> 00:17:22.210
to be able to do that.

00:17:22.210 --> 00:17:24.670
I had lived in New York
City for a few years

00:17:24.670 --> 00:17:27.790
when I was trying to make
the comedy thing continue

00:17:27.790 --> 00:17:28.359
to happen.

00:17:28.359 --> 00:17:32.020
And I never even
saw a show in there.

00:17:32.020 --> 00:17:34.450
I mean, obviously,
I knew of the venue.

00:17:34.450 --> 00:17:35.800
It's iconic.

00:17:35.800 --> 00:17:41.630
And then, to be able to do a
show there was pretty cool.

00:17:41.630 --> 00:17:44.590
And it was a live special
for Comedy Central.

00:17:44.590 --> 00:17:47.860
Comedy Central had never
done a live special before.

00:17:47.860 --> 00:17:49.540
And I pitched that to them.

00:17:49.540 --> 00:17:53.900
And they were like, all
right, let's give it a shot.

00:17:53.900 --> 00:17:55.692
So it was really
something else, yeah.

00:17:55.692 --> 00:17:58.150
MARC DE SCHWEINITZ: How do the
networks like Comedy Central

00:17:58.150 --> 00:18:00.300
decide to do a show like that?

00:18:00.300 --> 00:18:04.440
Do they actually send people
out to watch your shows?

00:18:04.440 --> 00:18:07.955
Or is it all word of
mouth from the industry?

00:18:07.955 --> 00:18:08.830
BRIAN REGAN: Well no.

00:18:08.830 --> 00:18:13.340
The people who come out are
buying tickets to see the show.

00:18:13.340 --> 00:18:14.940
I hope that's what happened.

00:18:14.940 --> 00:18:16.190
MARC DE SCHWEINITZ: Of course.

00:18:16.190 --> 00:18:16.870
[LAUGHTER]

00:18:16.870 --> 00:18:18.703
BRIAN REGAN: I'd hate
to think they just got

00:18:18.703 --> 00:18:20.770
a bunch of audience fillers.

00:18:20.770 --> 00:18:24.400
But no, it's in front
of an audience of people

00:18:24.400 --> 00:18:25.690
who want to see my show.

00:18:25.690 --> 00:18:28.480
And they just happened
to film, you know.

00:18:28.480 --> 00:18:32.120
But the live thing was
pretty scary, you know.

00:18:32.120 --> 00:18:33.340
Not scary.

00:18:33.340 --> 00:18:34.570
That was too strong a word.

00:18:34.570 --> 00:18:39.370
But it was a challenge because
usually when you do a special,

00:18:39.370 --> 00:18:41.020
you do more than one show.

00:18:41.020 --> 00:18:43.090
And if you mess up
a joke in one show,

00:18:43.090 --> 00:18:46.030
you can pull the better
version from another show

00:18:46.030 --> 00:18:47.760
and cobble it together.

00:18:47.760 --> 00:18:56.502
But live, every moment
had to be on the money.

00:18:56.502 --> 00:18:58.210
MARC DE SCHWEINITZ:
I think it went well.

00:18:58.210 --> 00:18:59.020
I didn't see any
disasters or anything.

00:18:59.020 --> 00:19:00.603
BRIAN REGAN: Oh,
well I appreciate it.

00:19:00.603 --> 00:19:02.640
I messed up a few things.

00:19:02.640 --> 00:19:04.750
But I was able to fix
them in the moment.

00:19:04.750 --> 00:19:07.140
Like, I left out a
punch line of one bit.

00:19:07.140 --> 00:19:08.770
Then, I goofed up a transition.

00:19:08.770 --> 00:19:11.296
But you know, I've done it
enough where it's like, OK,

00:19:11.296 --> 00:19:12.670
I've got to fix
this immediately.

00:19:12.670 --> 00:19:14.539
And then, I fixed
it and moved on.

00:19:14.539 --> 00:19:16.330
MARC DE SCHWEINITZ: I
think a lot of people

00:19:16.330 --> 00:19:18.760
don't try what you
do because of nerves

00:19:18.760 --> 00:19:20.240
and fear that they'll freeze up.

00:19:20.240 --> 00:19:24.025
Have you ever frozen up on
stage and not known what to say?

00:19:24.025 --> 00:19:27.895
BRIAN REGAN: Yes, I have.

00:19:27.895 --> 00:19:29.980
I've had some
horrible experiences.

00:19:29.980 --> 00:19:32.830
[LAUGHTER]

00:19:32.830 --> 00:19:34.370
Absolutely terrible.

00:19:34.370 --> 00:19:36.310
I had one on Letterman.

00:19:36.310 --> 00:19:37.810
I did Letterman.

00:19:37.810 --> 00:19:40.450
And I was very fortunate.

00:19:40.450 --> 00:19:42.760
They had let me on that
show a number of times.

00:19:42.760 --> 00:19:44.420
And usually, I would
just do stand-up.

00:19:44.420 --> 00:19:46.000
But occasionally,
I would do panel--

00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:49.000
meaning this-- in
addition to the stand-up.

00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:51.340
And on this one episode,
I did the stand-up.

00:19:51.340 --> 00:19:52.060
It went well.

00:19:52.060 --> 00:19:52.976
I was happy with that.

00:19:52.976 --> 00:19:55.180
I go and sit down and do panel.

00:19:55.180 --> 00:19:57.820
And they do a pre-interview,
which we haven't done.

00:19:57.820 --> 00:19:59.070
All of this is right off the--

00:19:59.070 --> 00:20:01.090
[LAUGHTER]

00:20:01.090 --> 00:20:03.430
They do a pre-interview.

00:20:03.430 --> 00:20:06.040
And so the pre-interview
was Dave Letterman

00:20:06.040 --> 00:20:10.630
was going to ask me if I've
been taking care of myself.

00:20:10.630 --> 00:20:12.640
And then, I was going
to go into a routine

00:20:12.640 --> 00:20:15.420
about going to the doctor.

00:20:15.420 --> 00:20:16.700
So I did the stand-up.

00:20:16.700 --> 00:20:18.110
I go sit down.

00:20:18.110 --> 00:20:19.160
He said some nice things.

00:20:19.160 --> 00:20:22.942
He goes, so are you
staying in shape?

00:20:22.942 --> 00:20:24.926
[LAUGHTER]

00:20:27.410 --> 00:20:30.890
That's not are you
taking care of yourself.

00:20:30.890 --> 00:20:33.204
And I'm trying to
figure out in the moment

00:20:33.204 --> 00:20:34.745
how do I get from
that to eye doctor.

00:20:34.745 --> 00:20:35.930
[LAUGHTER]

00:20:35.930 --> 00:20:39.242
And went, am I staying in shape?

00:20:39.242 --> 00:20:41.450
You know, and I just kind
of, like, hummed and hawed.

00:20:41.450 --> 00:20:42.783
And then, I took a sip of water.

00:20:42.783 --> 00:20:44.540
And I'm like, get
the eye doctor!

00:20:44.540 --> 00:20:45.836
Get the eye doctor!

00:20:45.836 --> 00:20:46.700
[LAUGHTER]

00:20:46.700 --> 00:20:49.320
And he's looking at me like,
what the hell's the matter,

00:20:49.320 --> 00:20:50.210
you know.

00:20:50.210 --> 00:20:51.580
And I said, yeah, yeah.

00:20:51.580 --> 00:20:53.420
I'm staying in shape.

00:20:53.420 --> 00:20:55.775
And then, I said, I recently
went to the eye doctor.

00:20:55.775 --> 00:20:57.494
[LAUGHTER]

00:20:59.410 --> 00:21:01.390
And he said, well,
that'll keep you in shape.

00:21:01.390 --> 00:21:02.630
[LAUGHTER]

00:21:02.630 --> 00:21:04.380
MARC DE SCHWEINITZ:
Tough transition, man.

00:21:04.380 --> 00:21:06.490
[LAUGHTER]

00:21:06.490 --> 00:21:08.830
BRIAN REGAN: And then, I
did my eye doctor routine.

00:21:08.830 --> 00:21:11.163
And the whole time I'm going,
man, that looked horrible.

00:21:11.163 --> 00:21:12.970
It just looked terrible.

00:21:12.970 --> 00:21:14.640
So those things
will happen, yeah.

00:21:14.640 --> 00:21:16.810
MARC DE SCHWEINITZ: Do
you re-watch your shows

00:21:16.810 --> 00:21:17.770
or performances after?

00:21:17.770 --> 00:21:19.353
BRIAN REGAN: I never
watched that one.

00:21:19.353 --> 00:21:20.410
[LAUGHTER]

00:21:20.410 --> 00:21:23.830
No, I watched that
one to learn from it.

00:21:23.830 --> 00:21:32.215
But if I do a TV thing, I will
watch it once, maybe twice.

00:21:32.215 --> 00:21:33.840
I don't like watching
myself, you know.

00:21:33.840 --> 00:21:35.010
I like listening.

00:21:35.010 --> 00:21:36.750
I tape my show
every night, audio,

00:21:36.750 --> 00:21:39.475
and I listen because
I'm working on jokes.

00:21:39.475 --> 00:21:41.850
I'm working on the words, and
the beats, and the moments.

00:21:41.850 --> 00:21:43.725
But the watching part,
I'm not that into.

00:21:43.725 --> 00:21:45.850
MARC DE SCHWEINITZ: So you
listen for the laughter.

00:21:45.850 --> 00:21:49.231
Are there are certain things in
particular that gear you off?

00:21:49.231 --> 00:21:49.980
BRIAN REGAN: Yeah.

00:21:49.980 --> 00:21:52.050
Like go what's a better
way of saying this?

00:21:52.050 --> 00:21:54.330
What's a better way of
saying that, you know.

00:21:54.330 --> 00:21:57.180
MARC DE SCHWEINITZ: Do you
have a favorite joke or topic

00:21:57.180 --> 00:22:00.471
that you like to perform?

00:22:00.471 --> 00:22:03.419
BRIAN REGAN: Uh, I'm not gonna--

00:22:03.419 --> 00:22:04.460
I went to the eye doctor.

00:22:04.460 --> 00:22:05.930
[LAUGHTER]

00:22:11.820 --> 00:22:16.140
I like to keep switching
up what I'm talking about.

00:22:18.720 --> 00:22:21.390
Lately I've been doing--

00:22:21.390 --> 00:22:25.470
well the reason is,
most people, they

00:22:25.470 --> 00:22:27.660
find out something that
works for themselves,

00:22:27.660 --> 00:22:31.500
and then they
write towards that.

00:22:31.500 --> 00:22:32.550
They work towards that.

00:22:32.550 --> 00:22:36.160
It's like, oh, people
see this about me.

00:22:36.160 --> 00:22:38.470
So I'm going to do more
of that kind of thing.

00:22:38.470 --> 00:22:40.470
And I've always resisted that.

00:22:40.470 --> 00:22:42.570
I've always written away from--

00:22:42.570 --> 00:22:47.160
as soon as I feel like I'm
being defined a certain way,

00:22:47.160 --> 00:22:50.400
I write away from that,
which has probably slowed me

00:22:50.400 --> 00:22:53.760
down in terms of
career because I

00:22:53.760 --> 00:22:59.490
don't want it easy for somebody
to hang their hat on what I do.

00:22:59.490 --> 00:23:00.840
Oh, he's the guy that does this.

00:23:00.840 --> 00:23:02.190
I don't want to be that.

00:23:02.190 --> 00:23:05.130
I want to be who knows
what he does, you know.

00:23:05.130 --> 00:23:08.560
For a while, I did a lot of
jokes about feeling stupid.

00:23:08.560 --> 00:23:10.170
You know, feeling
stupid fantasies.

00:23:10.170 --> 00:23:11.914
And I would go over
the top with them.

00:23:11.914 --> 00:23:13.830
You know, like saying
you too when you get out

00:23:13.830 --> 00:23:15.060
of a cab at an airport.

00:23:15.060 --> 00:23:17.250
You know, the driver
goes, have a nice flight.

00:23:17.250 --> 00:23:19.100
And you go, you too.

00:23:19.100 --> 00:23:21.150
too, you have a nice flight too.

00:23:21.150 --> 00:23:22.440
So I had jokes like that.

00:23:22.440 --> 00:23:23.730
[LAUGHTER]

00:23:23.730 --> 00:23:26.070
And then, I would start
reading in reviews,

00:23:26.070 --> 00:23:28.450
oh, Brian's the guy who
feels stupid all the time.

00:23:28.450 --> 00:23:31.033
And I'm like, all right, I don't
want to be that all the time.

00:23:31.033 --> 00:23:32.820
So I started writing
anger fantasies.

00:23:32.820 --> 00:23:35.490
Anger fantasies of
things that upset me.

00:23:35.490 --> 00:23:38.561
People trying to stick stuff
in the overhead rack in a plane

00:23:38.561 --> 00:23:39.810
that's not gonna fit in there.

00:23:39.810 --> 00:23:41.790
And I would go, I would
run up there, hey,

00:23:41.790 --> 00:23:43.260
does that look like
it's gonna fit?

00:23:43.260 --> 00:23:44.260
You have this much room.

00:23:44.260 --> 00:23:46.920
You have a dead yak.

00:23:46.920 --> 00:23:48.510
So I did anger fantasies.

00:23:48.510 --> 00:23:51.390
And then, people started
writing, oh, Brian always

00:23:51.390 --> 00:23:53.400
crouches down when he performs.

00:23:53.400 --> 00:23:55.320
He crouches and
prowls the stage.

00:23:55.320 --> 00:23:57.800
And I said, I'll show them.

00:23:57.800 --> 00:23:58.920
I'm gonna walk erect.

00:23:58.920 --> 00:24:00.990
[LAUGHTER]

00:24:00.990 --> 00:24:04.230
You know, so I always
write away from what

00:24:04.230 --> 00:24:06.540
I think people are beginning
to figure out about me.

00:24:06.540 --> 00:24:08.070
MARC DE SCHWEINITZ: People
try to corner you into--

00:24:08.070 --> 00:24:08.850
BRIAN REGAN: Yeah,
and I don't want it.

00:24:08.850 --> 00:24:09.933
MARC DE SCHWEINITZ: Right.

00:24:09.933 --> 00:24:11.550
Do you have peers
that you collaborate

00:24:11.550 --> 00:24:13.290
with on your comedy?

00:24:13.290 --> 00:24:14.310
Jim Gaffigan?

00:24:14.310 --> 00:24:15.090
Seinfeld?

00:24:15.090 --> 00:24:16.900
Any of your--

00:24:16.900 --> 00:24:19.410
BRIAN REGAN: Well I
mean, we're all friends,

00:24:19.410 --> 00:24:22.190
and we all admire each
other and what we all do.

00:24:22.190 --> 00:24:26.190
But we don't necessarily sit
down and work on bits together.

00:24:26.190 --> 00:24:29.494
I did that one time
in New York years ago.

00:24:29.494 --> 00:24:31.410
A group of people said,
let's all get together

00:24:31.410 --> 00:24:34.390
and work on each
other's act, you know.

00:24:34.390 --> 00:24:35.670
And I was like, oh, OK.

00:24:35.670 --> 00:24:39.510
We all met at the Improv
Comedy Club in the afternoon.

00:24:39.510 --> 00:24:41.640
And each person had,
like, five minutes.

00:24:41.640 --> 00:24:43.890
And you would throw
out a brand new premise

00:24:43.890 --> 00:24:45.880
that you were working on.

00:24:45.880 --> 00:24:48.780
And then, all these
other comedians

00:24:48.780 --> 00:24:51.540
would come up with jokes
that could help you

00:24:51.540 --> 00:24:53.160
with your premise.

00:24:53.160 --> 00:24:54.540
And hopefully,
you had a premise.

00:24:54.540 --> 00:24:56.790
It would be like, hey, I
just joined a health club.

00:24:56.790 --> 00:24:59.940
And I feel inferior when
I go to the health club.

00:24:59.940 --> 00:25:02.400
I feel like everybody else is
bigger and stronger than me.

00:25:02.400 --> 00:25:03.400
And that's your premise.

00:25:03.400 --> 00:25:05.640
None of the people
would write stuff.

00:25:05.640 --> 00:25:07.740
So we get to this
one guy, and he goes,

00:25:07.740 --> 00:25:10.020
I want to do something
about travel.

00:25:10.020 --> 00:25:11.460
[LAUGHTER]

00:25:13.860 --> 00:25:15.310
MARC DE SCHWEINITZ: OK.

00:25:15.310 --> 00:25:16.770
BRIAN REGAN: OK.

00:25:16.770 --> 00:25:18.270
That's my premise.

00:25:18.270 --> 00:25:20.770
So he just wanted us to
write an act for him.

00:25:20.770 --> 00:25:22.070
[LAUGHTER]

00:25:22.070 --> 00:25:23.330
You know.

00:25:23.330 --> 00:25:28.296
Like, you need something
more than travel, buddy.

00:25:28.296 --> 00:25:30.920
And I'd rather come
up with it myself.

00:25:30.920 --> 00:25:36.020
I mean, that's the fun is
when an audience laughs

00:25:36.020 --> 00:25:40.670
at something you thought of,
you've made a connection.

00:25:40.670 --> 00:25:44.420
If somebody else thought
of it, that's boring to me.

00:25:44.420 --> 00:25:46.070
Then you're just a
conduit, you know.

00:25:46.070 --> 00:25:51.110
I want the thought to
have come from my brain.

00:25:51.110 --> 00:25:54.800
And these people in the audience
are hearing it, and receiving

00:25:54.800 --> 00:25:57.110
it, and then that's beautiful.

00:25:57.110 --> 00:25:58.280
MARC DE SCHWEINITZ: Hm.

00:25:58.280 --> 00:26:03.755
You've performed comedy
for how many years now?

00:26:03.755 --> 00:26:06.380
BRIAN REGAN: I'm
gonna date myself.

00:26:06.380 --> 00:26:08.394
I started on "The
Ed Sullivan Show."

00:26:08.394 --> 00:26:11.120
[LAUGHTER]

00:26:11.120 --> 00:26:12.110
Since 1980.

00:26:12.110 --> 00:26:14.570
MARC DE SCHWEINITZ: 1980.

00:26:14.570 --> 00:26:15.720
How have you evolved as a--

00:26:15.720 --> 00:26:17.345
BRIAN REGAN: Everybody's
doing the math

00:26:17.345 --> 00:26:19.650
going this guy is 87 years old.

00:26:19.650 --> 00:26:22.499
[LAUGHTER]

00:26:22.499 --> 00:26:23.540
MARC DE SCHWEINITZ: Yeah.

00:26:23.540 --> 00:26:25.460
Hopefully we can do
some math in here.

00:26:25.460 --> 00:26:26.900
[LAUGHTER]

00:26:26.900 --> 00:26:28.400
BRIAN REGAN: People
are Googling it.

00:26:28.400 --> 00:26:28.620
MARC DE SCHWEINITZ: Googling.

00:26:28.620 --> 00:26:29.600
[LAUGHTER]

00:26:29.600 --> 00:26:31.530
Sure.

00:26:31.530 --> 00:26:32.230
How was your--

00:26:32.230 --> 00:26:33.910
[LAUGHTER]

00:26:33.910 --> 00:26:36.118
BRIAN REGAN: I thought
that's where I was.

00:26:36.118 --> 00:26:36.777
[LAUGHTER]

00:26:36.777 --> 00:26:38.360
MARC DE SCHWEINITZ:
How has your style

00:26:38.360 --> 00:26:41.896
changed from maybe the first
half of your career to now?

00:26:41.896 --> 00:26:44.270
BRIAN REGAN: Now I do anger
fantasies, and I stand erect.

00:26:44.270 --> 00:26:45.680
[LAUGHTER]

00:26:49.910 --> 00:26:52.069
Well like I said,
when I first started,

00:26:52.069 --> 00:26:53.360
I threw everything at the wall.

00:26:53.360 --> 00:26:57.440
And then, I don't know.

00:26:57.440 --> 00:26:59.330
I wouldn't even know
how to describe a style.

00:26:59.330 --> 00:27:01.230
But I do like to change
what I'm talking about.

00:27:01.230 --> 00:27:02.688
I started to get
into that earlier.

00:27:02.688 --> 00:27:10.369
Lately, I've been doing stuff
about foreign policy and guns.

00:27:10.369 --> 00:27:12.410
I did this in case you
didn't know what guns are.

00:27:12.410 --> 00:27:14.210
[LAUGHTER]

00:27:14.210 --> 00:27:15.290
I'm a visual--

00:27:15.290 --> 00:27:17.250
I told you I'm a bad prop comic.

00:27:17.250 --> 00:27:19.340
[LAUGHTER]

00:27:19.340 --> 00:27:20.510
What does he mean by gun?

00:27:20.510 --> 00:27:21.137
Oh, thank you.

00:27:21.137 --> 00:27:21.970
Thank you, comedian.

00:27:21.970 --> 00:27:22.855
[LAUGHTER]

00:27:23.414 --> 00:27:24.830
MARC DE SCHWEINITZ:
Are you trying

00:27:24.830 --> 00:27:27.770
to influence more than just
getting people to laugh?

00:27:27.770 --> 00:27:31.100
BRIAN REGAN: I want to do jokes
that both sides can laugh at.

00:27:31.100 --> 00:27:35.600
But I want to sneak a
point of view in there.

00:27:35.600 --> 00:27:40.010
But I want it cagey enough were
people on the other side think

00:27:40.010 --> 00:27:41.611
that I'm on their side.

00:27:41.611 --> 00:27:42.991
[LAUGHTER]

00:27:42.991 --> 00:27:45.490
MARC DE SCHWEINITZ: So you can
appeal to a broader audience.

00:27:45.490 --> 00:27:46.840
BRIAN REGAN: Exactly.

00:27:46.840 --> 00:27:49.180
I want everybody laughing,
but only half are going,

00:27:49.180 --> 00:27:50.800
I know where he's
really coming from.

00:27:50.800 --> 00:27:52.674
[LAUGHTER]

00:27:52.674 --> 00:27:54.590
MARC DE SCHWEINITZ: If
you weren't doing this,

00:27:54.590 --> 00:27:56.162
what would you be
doing as a career?

00:27:56.162 --> 00:27:57.620
BRIAN REGAN: When
I was in college,

00:27:57.620 --> 00:28:01.910
I had a cartoon strip for
my college newspaper called

00:28:01.910 --> 00:28:04.850
"The Adventures Of Ned."

00:28:04.850 --> 00:28:07.160
And Ned was a stick man.

00:28:07.160 --> 00:28:11.290
And he was the only living
stick man in a human body world.

00:28:14.030 --> 00:28:15.920
I wasn't a good
enough cartoonist

00:28:15.920 --> 00:28:18.230
to draw the same thing twice.

00:28:18.230 --> 00:28:19.790
So I thought my
main character has

00:28:19.790 --> 00:28:24.320
to be a stick man because I
can't draw the same guy twice.

00:28:24.320 --> 00:28:26.840
And then, he was
like a superhero,

00:28:26.840 --> 00:28:29.960
but he would mess up.

00:28:29.960 --> 00:28:33.980
Like, if four people
were falling out

00:28:33.980 --> 00:28:35.990
of a helium balloon
or something,

00:28:35.990 --> 00:28:37.980
he would catch three,
and one would die.

00:28:37.980 --> 00:28:39.732
[LAUGHTER]

00:28:39.732 --> 00:28:41.056
MARC DE SCHWEINITZ: OK.

00:28:41.056 --> 00:28:42.680
BRIAN REGAN: And I
liked that about him

00:28:42.680 --> 00:28:45.660
that the world is
better because of him,

00:28:45.660 --> 00:28:48.672
but there's a dead guy
on the ground, you know.

00:28:48.672 --> 00:28:49.619
[LAUGHTER]

00:28:49.619 --> 00:28:51.410
MARC DE SCHWEINITZ: So
you'd be doing that.

00:28:51.410 --> 00:28:54.742
BRIAN REGAN: I just tried
to get that syndicated.

00:28:54.742 --> 00:28:55.700
MARC DE SCHWEINITZ: OK.

00:28:55.700 --> 00:28:58.520
BRIAN REGAN: And I put a
bunch of things together.

00:28:58.520 --> 00:29:00.110
There's some book
that teaches you

00:29:00.110 --> 00:29:01.640
how to get stuff syndicated.

00:29:01.640 --> 00:29:05.150
And I sent it to this
syndication company.

00:29:05.150 --> 00:29:07.970
And they sent me a
rejection letter.

00:29:07.970 --> 00:29:13.490
And I didn't realize I had not
yet learned the word tenacity.

00:29:13.490 --> 00:29:16.014
I was like, well, I guess
I can't be a cartoonist.

00:29:16.014 --> 00:29:17.430
MARC DE SCHWEINITZ:
One rejection.

00:29:17.430 --> 00:29:18.721
BRIAN REGAN: Like, that was it.

00:29:18.721 --> 00:29:21.350
I just wrote that off instead of
going well, no, try over here.

00:29:21.350 --> 00:29:22.810
Try over here.

00:29:22.810 --> 00:29:25.070
I sent it out to one place.

00:29:25.070 --> 00:29:26.660
They sent me a rejection letter.

00:29:26.660 --> 00:29:28.650
And I closed that
part of my life off.

00:29:28.650 --> 00:29:29.741
[LAUGHTER]

00:29:29.741 --> 00:29:31.740
MARC DE SCHWEINITZ: So
that can be another tip--

00:29:31.740 --> 00:29:33.531
BRIAN REGAN: A good
lesson for kids, right?

00:29:33.531 --> 00:29:35.160
If somebody says
no, believe them!

00:29:35.160 --> 00:29:36.936
[LAUGHTER]

00:29:36.936 --> 00:29:38.060
MARC DE SCHWEINITZ: Switch.

00:29:38.060 --> 00:29:40.250
Scott Adams, the
"Dilbert" cartoonist,

00:29:40.250 --> 00:29:42.150
actually has a similar story.

00:29:42.150 --> 00:29:43.130
Yet, he stuck with it.

00:29:43.130 --> 00:29:44.130
BRIAN REGAN: Ha!

00:29:44.130 --> 00:29:45.338
MARC DE SCHWEINITZ: You know.

00:29:45.338 --> 00:29:46.150
[LAUGHTER]

00:29:46.150 --> 00:29:47.650
BRIAN REGAN: That's
the good ending!

00:29:47.650 --> 00:29:48.310
MARC DE SCHWEINITZ: Yeah so--

00:29:48.310 --> 00:29:49.220
BRIAN REGAN: That's the
good ending to that story.

00:29:49.220 --> 00:29:49.640
MARC DE SCHWEINITZ:
But he didn't

00:29:49.640 --> 00:29:52.580
consider himself a great
cartoonist by any means.

00:29:52.580 --> 00:29:53.480
BRIAN REGAN: Oh, wow.

00:29:53.480 --> 00:29:54.055
That's interesting.

00:29:54.055 --> 00:29:54.450
MARC DE SCHWEINITZ: Yeah.

00:29:54.450 --> 00:29:55.725
He has a good book out too.

00:29:55.725 --> 00:29:57.916
[LAUGHTER]

00:29:57.916 --> 00:29:59.790
BRIAN REGAN: So that's
what I would be doing.

00:29:59.790 --> 00:30:02.210
I, hopefully, would
be a cartoonist.

00:30:02.210 --> 00:30:04.580
MARC DE SCHWEINITZ: Yeah, OK.

00:30:04.580 --> 00:30:07.790
We'd actually like to have some
Q&amp;A with the audience here.

00:30:07.790 --> 00:30:09.615
So now is your opportunity.

00:30:09.615 --> 00:30:10.330
We'll open it up.

00:30:10.330 --> 00:30:12.080
Is that OK with you,
Brian, have some Q&amp;A?

00:30:12.080 --> 00:30:12.830
BRIAN REGAN: Sure.

00:30:12.830 --> 00:30:14.640
It is OK with me.

00:30:14.640 --> 00:30:15.890
MARC DE SCHWEINITZ: All right.

00:30:15.890 --> 00:30:16.595
Go ahead.

00:30:16.595 --> 00:30:18.320
BRIAN REGAN: I think
it's weird that he's

00:30:18.320 --> 00:30:20.540
walking to a microphone
when he was literally four

00:30:20.540 --> 00:30:21.350
feet away from me.

00:30:21.350 --> 00:30:23.450
[LAUGHTER]

00:30:23.450 --> 00:30:24.601
He's walking further away.

00:30:24.601 --> 00:30:25.100
No, no, no.

00:30:25.100 --> 00:30:26.010
I'm joking.

00:30:26.010 --> 00:30:26.510
I'm joking.

00:30:26.510 --> 00:30:26.990
AUDIENCE: I'll go back.

00:30:26.990 --> 00:30:27.990
BRIAN REGAN: No, no, no.

00:30:27.990 --> 00:30:29.390
I know this is for people.

00:30:29.390 --> 00:30:30.110
MARC DE SCHWEINITZ:
For the recording.

00:30:30.110 --> 00:30:31.610
AUDIENCE: So I'm wondering--

00:30:31.610 --> 00:30:33.610
Google owns YouTube, as well.

00:30:33.610 --> 00:30:35.799
BRIAN REGAN: OK.

00:30:35.799 --> 00:30:36.590
I didn't know that.

00:30:36.590 --> 00:30:39.392
AUDIENCE: And so I'm
wondering how YouTube has

00:30:39.392 --> 00:30:40.600
changed your comedy routines.

00:30:40.600 --> 00:30:43.869
And the reason I
ask is I know when

00:30:43.869 --> 00:30:45.910
you used to have a special,
then all of a sudden,

00:30:45.910 --> 00:30:48.060
you have to write
all new material.

00:30:48.060 --> 00:30:51.330
And now, every day,
your comedy routines

00:30:51.330 --> 00:30:53.490
are showing up on smart phones.

00:30:53.490 --> 00:30:57.105
So I'm wondering how you balance
that of creating new jokes when

00:30:57.105 --> 00:30:59.605
sometimes your jokes are showing
up the next day on YouTube.

00:30:59.605 --> 00:31:02.940
BRIAN REGAN: That's
a great question.

00:31:02.940 --> 00:31:06.060
I like the idea of--

00:31:06.060 --> 00:31:08.100
I wish I could decide
when a joke was

00:31:08.100 --> 00:31:11.070
ready for public
consumption, you know.

00:31:11.070 --> 00:31:15.060
And it used to be I would
be working on a Letterman

00:31:15.060 --> 00:31:16.315
spot or a Tonight Show spot.

00:31:16.315 --> 00:31:17.940
So I was working on
those five minutes.

00:31:17.940 --> 00:31:19.356
But while I was
working on that, I

00:31:19.356 --> 00:31:22.180
was working on whatever
the next hour would be.

00:31:22.180 --> 00:31:25.320
A special or a DVD.

00:31:25.320 --> 00:31:28.884
And then, once I did an hour, I
considered that material done.

00:31:28.884 --> 00:31:30.300
And I started
working away from it

00:31:30.300 --> 00:31:32.910
and replacing it
with the new hour.

00:31:32.910 --> 00:31:34.980
But like you say--

00:31:34.980 --> 00:31:38.520
and we try to stop this--
we ask people not to video

00:31:38.520 --> 00:31:39.360
during shows.

00:31:39.360 --> 00:31:43.570
But you know, you get people--

00:31:43.570 --> 00:31:45.731
I had a woman, I'm
on stage one time.

00:31:45.731 --> 00:31:46.730
She was holding an iPad.

00:31:46.730 --> 00:31:49.140
[LAUGHTER]

00:31:49.140 --> 00:31:50.822
Like she was giving
it to me as a gift.

00:31:50.822 --> 00:31:52.280
She was sitting
right in the front.

00:31:52.280 --> 00:31:53.954
And she's just holding it.

00:31:53.954 --> 00:31:55.620
And I'm like, are you
giving that to me?

00:31:55.620 --> 00:31:56.860
She goes, no, I'm taping you.

00:31:56.860 --> 00:31:57.890
[LAUGHTER]

00:31:57.890 --> 00:32:00.655
And I went, oh, well you
know that's not cool, right?

00:32:00.655 --> 00:32:01.530
She goes, no, no, no.

00:32:01.530 --> 00:32:02.140
I like you.

00:32:02.140 --> 00:32:03.526
[LAUGHTER]

00:32:03.526 --> 00:32:05.270
MARC DE SCHWEINITZ:
It's a compliment.

00:32:05.270 --> 00:32:06.370
BRIAN REGAN: Yeah.

00:32:06.370 --> 00:32:08.350
So I say, well, I
appreciate that.

00:32:08.350 --> 00:32:10.780
But I would like to think
that these jokes are just

00:32:10.780 --> 00:32:12.820
for us here.

00:32:12.820 --> 00:32:14.440
I said, I like to
decide when they're

00:32:14.440 --> 00:32:16.424
ready for the rest of the world.

00:32:16.424 --> 00:32:17.590
And she said, oh, I'm sorry.

00:32:17.590 --> 00:32:18.530
And she got embarrassed.

00:32:18.530 --> 00:32:19.988
I didn't want to
hurt her feelings.

00:32:19.988 --> 00:32:21.940
Like, she truly didn't know.

00:32:21.940 --> 00:32:25.220
But the bad thing about when
people tape and put it on

00:32:25.220 --> 00:32:26.980
is like I was saying earlier.

00:32:26.980 --> 00:32:31.990
Every joke is in a different
level of development.

00:32:31.990 --> 00:32:36.010
There are some jokes
that are brand new.

00:32:36.010 --> 00:32:37.690
They're not ready yet.

00:32:37.690 --> 00:32:40.150
I'm in the process
of working on them.

00:32:40.150 --> 00:32:44.540
And if somebody tapes it
and puts it on YouTube--

00:32:44.540 --> 00:32:47.020
I don't read comments anyway.

00:32:47.020 --> 00:32:49.350
But I used to, and
I don't anymore.

00:32:49.350 --> 00:32:50.809
And somebody can
make a bad comment

00:32:50.809 --> 00:32:52.308
and go, well, that's
not very funny.

00:32:52.308 --> 00:32:53.980
And it's like, I
didn't say it was.

00:32:53.980 --> 00:32:55.240
[LAUGHTER]

00:32:55.240 --> 00:32:58.154
It would be like you put
brownies in the oven,

00:32:58.154 --> 00:33:00.070
and somebody just walks
in and takes them out.

00:33:00.070 --> 00:33:02.200
[LAUGHTER]

00:33:02.200 --> 00:33:03.934
The oven didn't ding yet!

00:33:03.934 --> 00:33:04.850
[LAUGHTER]

00:33:04.850 --> 00:33:06.580
I didn't pull them
out of the oven.

00:33:06.580 --> 00:33:08.230
You pulled them out of the oven.

00:33:08.230 --> 00:33:12.550
It's the same with somebody
putting a clip on YouTube

00:33:12.550 --> 00:33:13.780
when it's not ready.

00:33:13.780 --> 00:33:18.220
And there's a lot of
comedians trying to fight it

00:33:18.220 --> 00:33:20.050
and probably other
artists, as well.

00:33:20.050 --> 00:33:24.970
But there's these bags
that people sometimes-- you

00:33:24.970 --> 00:33:27.370
go to an event, and they
have these bags that you

00:33:27.370 --> 00:33:28.500
got to put your phone in.

00:33:28.500 --> 00:33:29.770
They won't even let
you into the venue

00:33:29.770 --> 00:33:30.978
unless you put your phone in.

00:33:30.978 --> 00:33:31.900
And they lock it.

00:33:31.900 --> 00:33:33.275
You can have your
phone with you,

00:33:33.275 --> 00:33:35.500
but you can't have access to it.

00:33:35.500 --> 00:33:40.280
I don't go that far yet, but
we do ask people not to tape.

00:33:40.280 --> 00:33:41.770
But people do it anyway.

00:33:41.770 --> 00:33:42.875
You know, you see them.

00:33:42.875 --> 00:33:43.750
And you look at them.

00:33:43.750 --> 00:33:44.333
They're like--

00:33:44.333 --> 00:33:45.972
[LAUGHTER]

00:33:48.117 --> 00:33:49.250
MARC DE SCHWEINITZ: Right.

00:33:49.250 --> 00:33:52.617
Maybe you can call them out
and make fun of them publicly.

00:33:52.617 --> 00:33:54.950
BRIAN REGAN: Yeah, but then
it takes you off your thing.

00:33:54.950 --> 00:33:56.033
MARC DE SCHWEINITZ: Right.

00:33:56.033 --> 00:33:56.680
OK.

00:33:56.680 --> 00:33:57.660
Other questions?

00:33:57.660 --> 00:33:58.810
Thanks, Brian.

00:33:58.810 --> 00:34:00.768
AUDIENCE: I'm not gonna
talk into the dead mic.

00:34:00.768 --> 00:34:02.525
But you're notorious,
as you already

00:34:02.525 --> 00:34:03.650
mentioned, for being clean.

00:34:03.650 --> 00:34:06.670
Do you have a favorite
dirty joke or a dirty joke

00:34:06.670 --> 00:34:08.498
that you enjoy?

00:34:08.498 --> 00:34:09.962
[LAUGHTER]

00:34:09.962 --> 00:34:11.670
MARC DE SCHWEINITZ:
I didn't set this up.

00:34:11.670 --> 00:34:15.366
[LAUGHTER]

00:34:15.366 --> 00:34:18.310
BRIAN REGAN: But I
don't know if I can.

00:34:18.310 --> 00:34:21.469
I'll try to do a clean version
of a joke I used to do.

00:34:21.469 --> 00:34:22.717
[LAUGHTER]

00:34:22.717 --> 00:34:24.300
I don't even know
if this is possible.

00:34:24.300 --> 00:34:27.250
But there's a bad word in it.

00:34:27.250 --> 00:34:29.650
And I used the bad word many
times in the punch line.

00:34:29.650 --> 00:34:34.960
So I used to do a thing
about diagramming sentences.

00:34:34.960 --> 00:34:39.130
I have this whole school
routine, which is out there.

00:34:39.130 --> 00:34:43.239
But I used to end it by
saying our teacher used

00:34:43.239 --> 00:34:46.150
to try to teach us how
to diagram sentences.

00:34:46.150 --> 00:34:48.590
And I said I grew up in Miami.

00:34:48.590 --> 00:34:51.750
And we had a new kid from New
York City who had moved down,

00:34:51.750 --> 00:34:53.199
and he sat next to me in class.

00:34:53.199 --> 00:34:56.085
And the teacher was
at the board saying,

00:34:56.085 --> 00:34:57.460
does anybody have
a sentence they

00:34:57.460 --> 00:35:00.050
want to try to
diagram for the class?

00:35:00.050 --> 00:35:03.205
And this kid next to
me said, go f yourself.

00:35:03.205 --> 00:35:05.139
[LAUGHTER]

00:35:05.139 --> 00:35:06.180
That's the clean version.

00:35:06.180 --> 00:35:08.460
[LAUGHTER]

00:35:08.460 --> 00:35:09.970
So the teacher got flustered.

00:35:09.970 --> 00:35:13.912
And she was like,
oh, OK, Mr. Big shot.

00:35:13.912 --> 00:35:16.120
Why don't you see if you
can come up here and diagram

00:35:16.120 --> 00:35:18.130
that for the class.

00:35:18.130 --> 00:35:21.616
And I said, that was a bad
move cause he knew how.

00:35:21.616 --> 00:35:23.320
[LAUGHTER]

00:35:23.320 --> 00:35:25.600
I said, he came up,
he grabbed the chalk,

00:35:25.600 --> 00:35:29.350
and he said, all right,
what is the noun?

00:35:29.350 --> 00:35:30.235
The noun is you.

00:35:30.235 --> 00:35:32.590
You don't hear it,
so it's understood.

00:35:32.590 --> 00:35:34.400
That goes in parentheses.

00:35:34.400 --> 00:35:36.009
Now what do you do?

00:35:36.009 --> 00:35:36.800
What is the action?

00:35:36.800 --> 00:35:37.806
[LAUGHTER]

00:35:37.806 --> 00:35:39.056
MARC DE SCHWEINITZ: All right.

00:35:39.056 --> 00:35:39.550
We got that.

00:35:39.550 --> 00:35:40.050
[LAUGHTER]

00:35:40.050 --> 00:35:43.070
BRIAN REGAN: F. Now you f whom?

00:35:43.070 --> 00:35:44.194
[LAUGHTER]

00:35:44.194 --> 00:35:45.790
Who receives that action?

00:35:45.790 --> 00:35:47.065
[LAUGHTER]

00:35:47.065 --> 00:35:47.565
Yourself.

00:35:47.565 --> 00:35:49.670
[LAUGHTER]

00:35:49.670 --> 00:35:50.860
Go is helping verb.

00:35:50.860 --> 00:35:53.400
It helps f.

00:35:53.400 --> 00:35:57.160
So and f, you go f,
you go f yourself.

00:35:57.160 --> 00:36:00.130
[LAUGHTER]

00:36:00.130 --> 00:36:00.860
[APPLAUSE]

00:36:00.860 --> 00:36:02.110
MARC DE SCHWEINITZ: All right.

00:36:02.110 --> 00:36:05.580
[APPLAUSE]

00:36:05.580 --> 00:36:08.350
BRIAN REGAN: And
it used to do well.

00:36:08.350 --> 00:36:13.140
And then, when I was doing my
first special ever on Showtime,

00:36:13.140 --> 00:36:14.977
that's when I drew a
line because people

00:36:14.977 --> 00:36:17.310
were saying you have to close
with that because I closed

00:36:17.310 --> 00:36:18.176
with the school.

00:36:18.176 --> 00:36:19.800
I think I closed with
the school thing.

00:36:19.800 --> 00:36:21.091
They said, you have to do that.

00:36:21.091 --> 00:36:23.250
And I'm like, I
don't want to do it

00:36:23.250 --> 00:36:27.510
because I just don't
want to do all clean,

00:36:27.510 --> 00:36:29.250
and then end with that.

00:36:29.250 --> 00:36:31.537
You know, I want it
to be more consistent.

00:36:31.537 --> 00:36:32.620
MARC DE SCHWEINITZ: Right.

00:36:32.620 --> 00:36:33.840
Makes sense.

00:36:33.840 --> 00:36:35.830
BRIAN REGAN: That's why
nobody knows who I am.

00:36:35.830 --> 00:36:39.260
[LAUGHTER]

00:36:39.260 --> 00:36:41.580
If I had done that, I
would be on parade floats.

00:36:41.580 --> 00:36:43.673
There's the go f yourself guy.

00:36:43.673 --> 00:36:44.660
[LAUGHTER]

00:36:44.660 --> 00:36:47.110
MARC DE SCHWEINITZ: You
might not want that.

00:36:47.110 --> 00:36:47.900
All right.

00:36:47.900 --> 00:36:48.620
Next question.

00:36:48.620 --> 00:36:49.080
AUDIENCE: Well yeah.

00:36:49.080 --> 00:36:50.570
Well first of all,
thanks for coming out.

00:36:50.570 --> 00:36:51.560
We appreciate having you.

00:36:51.560 --> 00:36:52.070
BRIAN REGAN: You're welcome.

00:36:52.070 --> 00:36:53.240
Thank you all for being here.

00:36:53.240 --> 00:36:54.365
AUDIENCE: Yeah, no problem.

00:36:54.365 --> 00:36:57.330
So at least I have and
I'm sure that you guys are

00:36:57.330 --> 00:37:01.160
familiar with the narrative
of mental health in comedians

00:37:01.160 --> 00:37:03.980
or loneliness with,
like, Robin Williams

00:37:03.980 --> 00:37:06.620
and other notable
cases like that.

00:37:06.620 --> 00:37:08.854
And I guess it makes
sense because, in my mind,

00:37:08.854 --> 00:37:11.270
you guys kind of just go out
and try to tell the world how

00:37:11.270 --> 00:37:12.030
you see it.

00:37:12.030 --> 00:37:14.488
People laugh at you and pay
money to laugh at you for that.

00:37:14.488 --> 00:37:17.390
But have you encountered that?

00:37:17.390 --> 00:37:20.660
And if you have, how has
the landscape of that

00:37:20.660 --> 00:37:23.750
within your profession
changed with people like Robin

00:37:23.750 --> 00:37:26.960
Williams in the last 37 years?

00:37:26.960 --> 00:37:30.170
BRIAN REGAN: Well Robin
Williams was brilliant.

00:37:30.170 --> 00:37:33.310
And it's unfortunate,
obviously, what happened to him.

00:37:36.230 --> 00:37:42.140
I met him two or three
times just very briefly.

00:37:42.140 --> 00:37:45.440
He was very quiet
and sweet offstage.

00:37:45.440 --> 00:37:49.389
Like, it was almost deferential,
which was so bizarre.

00:37:49.389 --> 00:37:50.930
Like, he would say,
hey, how are you.

00:37:50.930 --> 00:37:53.780
And you're like, you're
the guy that gets on stage

00:37:53.780 --> 00:37:55.980
and does that?

00:37:55.980 --> 00:37:57.640
So everybody that has met him--

00:37:57.640 --> 00:37:59.569
and again, I only met
him a handful of times--

00:37:59.569 --> 00:38:01.610
has said that he's just
a really sweet, nice guy.

00:38:05.030 --> 00:38:09.170
Who knows what's going on in
people's brains and people's

00:38:09.170 --> 00:38:11.960
minds, you know.

00:38:11.960 --> 00:38:16.430
I don't know if comedy has
more people with issues

00:38:16.430 --> 00:38:18.830
than other professions.

00:38:18.830 --> 00:38:19.550
I don't know.

00:38:19.550 --> 00:38:20.540
I'm not a psychologist.

00:38:20.540 --> 00:38:25.880
But there is something weird
about wanting to get on stage

00:38:25.880 --> 00:38:27.350
and subject yourself to--

00:38:30.110 --> 00:38:33.950
it's not a fun
experience to bomb.

00:38:33.950 --> 00:38:38.012
I'm sure that has nothing to
do with why he did what he did.

00:38:38.012 --> 00:38:39.470
I'm sure it was
much deeper issues.

00:38:39.470 --> 00:38:42.650
But I'm just talking about the
weirdness of getting on stage

00:38:42.650 --> 00:38:44.750
and wanting acceptance
from a roomful of people

00:38:44.750 --> 00:38:46.410
is, sort of a--

00:38:46.410 --> 00:38:49.830
that's a weird
personality trait.

00:38:49.830 --> 00:38:51.402
So I don't know.

00:38:51.402 --> 00:38:53.110
I don't know if I
answered your question.

00:38:53.110 --> 00:38:53.600
AUDIENCE: Good enough.

00:38:53.600 --> 00:38:53.900
Thanks.

00:38:53.900 --> 00:38:54.440
BRIAN REGAN: All right.

00:38:54.440 --> 00:38:55.045
Thank you.

00:38:55.045 --> 00:38:56.860
MARC DE SCHWEINITZ: Thank you.

00:38:56.860 --> 00:38:58.140
Go ahead.

00:38:58.140 --> 00:39:01.311
AUDIENCE: So in Fort Lauderdale,
you went on, like, every night.

00:39:01.311 --> 00:39:01.810
Right?

00:39:01.810 --> 00:39:06.020
Like, seven days a week.

00:39:06.020 --> 00:39:09.350
When you're going up and
you do your 5 or 15 minutes,

00:39:09.350 --> 00:39:12.080
are you doing new
material each time?

00:39:12.080 --> 00:39:14.960
Or you, like, the
door closing guy?

00:39:14.960 --> 00:39:19.040
If a crowd or people show up who
have heard your bit about them

00:39:19.040 --> 00:39:25.190
leaving, what was your
starting method for coming up

00:39:25.190 --> 00:39:26.107
with new material?

00:39:26.107 --> 00:39:27.440
And how often were you doing it?

00:39:27.440 --> 00:39:31.030
BRIAN REGAN: Well it's hard to
switch it night after night.

00:39:31.030 --> 00:39:34.730
You know, your hope was that
the audience was different

00:39:34.730 --> 00:39:35.450
each night.

00:39:35.450 --> 00:39:37.870
But people did
start to come back.

00:39:37.870 --> 00:39:41.540
And I knew it was
time to go when--

00:39:41.540 --> 00:39:43.925
I used to have this bit where
I did a fake impression.

00:39:43.925 --> 00:39:45.800
And I would say, hey,
y'all like impressions?

00:39:45.800 --> 00:39:46.787
And people go, yeah.

00:39:46.787 --> 00:39:47.620
And I go, all right.

00:39:47.620 --> 00:39:48.230
I'd like to do this.

00:39:48.230 --> 00:39:49.880
And then, I would turn
around and pretend like I'm

00:39:49.880 --> 00:39:51.200
doing something with my hair.

00:39:51.200 --> 00:39:54.430
And I'll go, you got
anything to eat, man?

00:39:54.430 --> 00:39:56.000
[LAUGHTER]

00:39:56.000 --> 00:39:59.074
You got anything to eat
because I'm starving?

00:39:59.074 --> 00:40:00.740
And then, they would
look at me weirdly.

00:40:00.740 --> 00:40:03.680
And I'd say, that's
Randy Johnson.

00:40:03.680 --> 00:40:05.190
He lives across
the street from me.

00:40:05.190 --> 00:40:07.118
[LAUGHTER]

00:40:10.492 --> 00:40:12.150
So it sounds just like him.

00:40:12.150 --> 00:40:14.442
[LAUGHTER]

00:40:14.442 --> 00:40:16.400
So a lot of people think
it looks like him too.

00:40:16.400 --> 00:40:17.930
But I don't think
it looks like him.

00:40:17.930 --> 00:40:19.640
But it does sound like him.

00:40:19.640 --> 00:40:23.030
So that was the joke.

00:40:23.030 --> 00:40:25.919
And then, it started to get
were some people would know.

00:40:25.919 --> 00:40:27.710
Like, I would go, you
got anything. to eat,

00:40:27.710 --> 00:40:29.510
man because I'm starving.

00:40:29.510 --> 00:40:32.405
And one night, a guy
went, Randy Johnson.

00:40:32.405 --> 00:40:33.226
I was like--

00:40:33.226 --> 00:40:35.651
[LAUGHTER]

00:40:35.651 --> 00:40:38.150
So I pretended like I didn't
know what he was talking about.

00:40:38.150 --> 00:40:38.990
And I would go, huh?

00:40:38.990 --> 00:40:40.190
No, that's Ed Brown.

00:40:40.190 --> 00:40:41.660
[LAUGHTER]

00:40:41.660 --> 00:40:43.530
He lives across
the street from me.

00:40:43.530 --> 00:40:44.030
[LAUGHTER]

00:40:44.030 --> 00:40:45.297
So that happened a few times.

00:40:45.297 --> 00:40:47.380
And then, one night I go,
you got anything to eat,

00:40:47.380 --> 00:40:48.790
man because I'm starving.

00:40:48.790 --> 00:40:50.270
And a guy goes, Randy Johnson.

00:40:50.270 --> 00:40:50.930
I went, no.

00:40:50.930 --> 00:40:52.370
And another guy went, Ed Brown.

00:40:52.370 --> 00:40:54.262
[LAUGHTER]

00:40:56.645 --> 00:40:58.435
It's time to go on the road.

00:40:58.435 --> 00:41:02.600
[LAUGHTER]

00:41:02.600 --> 00:41:03.680
Excellent.

00:41:03.680 --> 00:41:04.577
Tony?

00:41:04.577 --> 00:41:05.993
AUDIENCE: So I
would sat at Google

00:41:05.993 --> 00:41:08.250
we're a pretty politically
correct culture.

00:41:08.250 --> 00:41:10.120
But I bet a lot of
people in the audience

00:41:10.120 --> 00:41:13.540
also will laugh at stuff that is
probably politically incorrect

00:41:13.540 --> 00:41:14.826
or potentially offensive.

00:41:14.826 --> 00:41:17.200
And I'm kind of wondering
about that from your standpoint

00:41:17.200 --> 00:41:17.950
as a comedian.

00:41:17.950 --> 00:41:21.340
What is it that draws people in
sometimes to the material that

00:41:21.340 --> 00:41:24.010
is politically incorrect or
offensive that they wouldn't

00:41:24.010 --> 00:41:27.670
in other parts of their life
necessarily endorse or be

00:41:27.670 --> 00:41:29.501
supportive of?

00:41:29.501 --> 00:41:31.870
BRIAN REGAN: Even though
I work the way I work,

00:41:31.870 --> 00:41:33.850
I think everything is fair game.

00:41:33.850 --> 00:41:36.130
I think every
topic is fair game.

00:41:36.130 --> 00:41:38.380
Every subject
matter is fair game.

00:41:38.380 --> 00:41:41.110
All words are fair game.

00:41:41.110 --> 00:41:48.130
But it all comes down to context
and what are you trying to say.

00:41:48.130 --> 00:41:51.550
And hopefully, you have a
good message at your heart.

00:41:51.550 --> 00:41:56.700
If it's hateful, I support
your right to say it,

00:41:56.700 --> 00:42:00.330
but I'm not as into that
kind of comedy as somebody

00:42:00.330 --> 00:42:02.670
who might use
offensive language,

00:42:02.670 --> 00:42:09.910
or talk about tricky things,
but still has a good message.

00:42:09.910 --> 00:42:11.320
So it's weird.

00:42:11.320 --> 00:42:13.620
I mean, we live in a climate
where a lot of people

00:42:13.620 --> 00:42:15.800
are afraid to say
certain things.

00:42:15.800 --> 00:42:21.270
But I think everybody should be
able to say whatever they want.

00:42:21.270 --> 00:42:22.890
I mean, I draw the
line at violence.

00:42:22.890 --> 00:42:26.580
And I draw the line at
destruction and stuff

00:42:26.580 --> 00:42:27.090
like that.

00:42:27.090 --> 00:42:31.300
But thoughts and ideas
should just be out there.

00:42:31.300 --> 00:42:34.762
And if you disagree, debate it.

00:42:34.762 --> 00:42:35.720
Win with your argument.

00:42:39.127 --> 00:42:40.210
MARC DE SCHWEINITZ: Great.

00:42:40.210 --> 00:42:42.877
Well, Brian, I think we're going
to wrap up this interview here.

00:42:42.877 --> 00:42:44.793
BRIAN REGAN: We ended
on a super serious note.

00:42:44.793 --> 00:42:45.665
[LAUGHTER]

00:42:45.665 --> 00:42:46.420
MARC DE SCHWEINITZ:
Do you want to, uh--

00:42:46.420 --> 00:42:48.510
BRIAN REGAN: I gotta slip on
a banana peel or something

00:42:48.510 --> 00:42:49.404
to close this out.

00:42:49.404 --> 00:42:51.417
[LAUGHTER]

00:42:51.417 --> 00:42:53.500
I feel like that's when
you decided to wrap it up.

00:42:53.500 --> 00:42:55.714
Oh, he's getting into
some scary territory.

00:42:55.714 --> 00:42:57.160
MARC DE SCHWEINITZ:
I'm like, oh.

00:42:57.160 --> 00:42:57.810
BRIAN REGAN: Thanks
for coming, Brian.

00:42:57.810 --> 00:42:59.643
MARC DE SCHWEINITZ: The
kill switch on here.

00:42:59.643 --> 00:43:01.380
[LAUGHTER]

00:43:01.380 --> 00:43:04.900
Any last words of advice
for aspiring comedians

00:43:04.900 --> 00:43:05.744
watching this?

00:43:05.744 --> 00:43:07.660
BRIAN REGAN: If it's
something you want to do,

00:43:07.660 --> 00:43:09.310
man, it's in your
heart, go for it.

00:43:09.310 --> 00:43:12.340
And you're gonna have bad shows.

00:43:12.340 --> 00:43:13.690
Don't let that stop you.

00:43:13.690 --> 00:43:16.280
Just keep rocking and rolling.

00:43:16.280 --> 00:43:17.530
MARC DE SCHWEINITZ: Thank you.

00:43:17.530 --> 00:43:18.760
That's been amazing.

00:43:18.760 --> 00:43:19.530
Thank you, Brian.

00:43:19.530 --> 00:43:20.130
BRIAN REGAN: Thank you, Mark.

00:43:20.130 --> 00:43:21.129
Thank you all very much.

00:43:21.129 --> 00:43:23.780
[APPLAUSE]
