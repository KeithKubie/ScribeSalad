00:00:00.871 --> 00:00:02.619
- [Instructor] In past
videos, we've thought about

00:00:02.619 --> 00:00:05.141
whether segment lengths or angle measures

00:00:05.141 --> 00:00:07.638
are preserved with a transformation.

00:00:07.638 --> 00:00:09.798
What we're now gonna think
about is what is preserved

00:00:09.798 --> 00:00:12.358
with a sequence of transformations?

00:00:12.358 --> 00:00:15.643
And in particular, we're gonna
think about angle measure.

00:00:15.643 --> 00:00:18.287
Angle measure

00:00:18.287 --> 00:00:20.067
and segment lengths.

00:00:20.067 --> 00:00:22.568
So if you're transforming
some type of a shape.

00:00:22.568 --> 00:00:25.907
Segment, segment lengths.

00:00:25.907 --> 00:00:27.538
So let's look at this first example.

00:00:27.538 --> 00:00:30.419
They say a sequence of
transformations is described below.

00:00:30.419 --> 00:00:34.348
So we first do a translation,
then we do a reflection

00:00:34.348 --> 00:00:37.335
over a horizontal line, PQ,

00:00:37.335 --> 00:00:41.354
then we do vertical stretch about PQ.

00:00:41.354 --> 00:00:42.478
What is this going to do?

00:00:42.478 --> 00:00:44.718
Is this going to preserve angle measures

00:00:44.718 --> 00:00:48.222
and is this going to
preserve segment lengths?

00:00:48.222 --> 00:00:51.505
Well a translation is
a rigid transformation

00:00:51.505 --> 00:00:53.081
and so that will preserve both

00:00:53.081 --> 00:00:55.149
angle measures and segment lengths.

00:00:55.149 --> 00:00:57.502
So after that, angle
measures and segment lengths

00:00:57.502 --> 00:00:59.324
are still going to be the same.

00:00:59.324 --> 00:01:03.820
A reflection over a horizontal line PQ.

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:07.107
Well a reflection is also
a rigid transformation

00:01:07.107 --> 00:01:09.158
and so we will continue to preserve

00:01:09.158 --> 00:01:11.536
angle measure and segment lengths.

00:01:11.536 --> 00:01:15.770
Then they say a vertical stretch about PQ.

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:18.489
Well let's just think about
what a vertical stretch does.

00:01:18.489 --> 00:01:22.749
So if I have some
triangle right over here.

00:01:22.749 --> 00:01:25.595
If I have some triangle
that looks like this.

00:01:25.595 --> 00:01:28.656
Let's say it's triangle A, B, C.

00:01:28.656 --> 00:01:31.018
And if you were to do a vertical stretch,

00:01:31.018 --> 00:01:32.369
what's going to happen?

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:35.401
Well let's just imagine
that we take these sides

00:01:35.401 --> 00:01:38.896
and we stretch them
out so that we now have

00:01:38.896 --> 00:01:42.307
A is over here or A prime
I should say is over there.

00:01:42.307 --> 00:01:45.974
Let's say that B prime is now over here.

00:01:47.346 --> 00:01:49.103
This isn't going to be exact.

00:01:49.103 --> 00:01:51.854
Well what just happened to my triangle?

00:01:51.854 --> 00:01:54.973
Well the measure of angle C is for sure

00:01:54.973 --> 00:01:56.891
going to be different now.

00:01:56.891 --> 00:01:59.153
And my segment lengths are for sure

00:01:59.153 --> 00:02:00.777
going to be different now.

00:02:00.777 --> 00:02:04.425
A prime C prime is going
to be different than AC

00:02:04.425 --> 00:02:06.126
in terms of segment length.

00:02:06.126 --> 00:02:08.592
So a vertical stretch, if
we're talking about a stretch

00:02:08.592 --> 00:02:11.711
in general, this is going
to preserve neither.

00:02:11.711 --> 00:02:14.771
So neither preserved,

00:02:14.771 --> 00:02:16.536
neither preserved.

00:02:16.536 --> 00:02:19.569
So in general, if you're
doing rigid transformation

00:02:19.569 --> 00:02:21.568
after rigid transformation,
you're gonna preserve

00:02:21.568 --> 00:02:23.569
both angles and segment lengths.

00:02:23.569 --> 00:02:27.113
But if you throw a stretch in
there, then all bets are off.

00:02:27.113 --> 00:02:29.466
You're not going to
preserve either of them.

00:02:29.466 --> 00:02:32.335
Let's do another example.

00:02:32.335 --> 00:02:34.794
A sequence of transformations
is described below.

00:02:34.794 --> 00:02:36.786
And so they give three transformations.

00:02:36.786 --> 00:02:40.060
So pause this video and think
about whether angle measures,

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:43.181
segment lengths, or will either both

00:02:43.181 --> 00:02:47.176
or neither or only one
of them be preserved?

00:02:47.176 --> 00:02:50.492
Alright so first we have a
rotation about a point P.

00:02:50.492 --> 00:02:53.268
That's a rigid transformation,
it would preserve both

00:02:53.268 --> 00:02:56.189
segment lengths and angle measures.

00:02:56.189 --> 00:02:57.910
Then you have a translation which is

00:02:57.910 --> 00:03:00.038
also a rigid transformation and so

00:03:00.038 --> 00:03:02.358
that would preserve both again.

00:03:02.358 --> 00:03:06.364
Then we have a rotation about point P.

00:03:06.364 --> 00:03:09.019
So once again, another
rigid transformation.

00:03:09.019 --> 00:03:13.590
So in this situation, everything
is going to be preserved.

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:17.241
So both angle measure,

00:03:17.241 --> 00:03:19.074
angle measure

00:03:20.379 --> 00:03:24.715
and segment length are
going to be preserved

00:03:24.715 --> 00:03:26.181
in this example.

00:03:26.181 --> 00:03:28.348
Let's do one more example.

00:03:29.852 --> 00:03:32.634
So here once again we have a
sequence of transformations.

00:03:32.634 --> 00:03:35.359
And so pause this video again
and see if you can figure out

00:03:35.359 --> 00:03:38.515
whether measures, segment
lengths, both or neither

00:03:38.515 --> 00:03:40.952
are going to be preserved.

00:03:40.952 --> 00:03:44.964
So the first transformation is a dilation.

00:03:44.964 --> 00:03:48.081
So a dilation is a
nonrigid transformation.

00:03:48.081 --> 00:03:50.631
So segment lengths not preserved.

00:03:50.631 --> 00:03:54.714
Segment lengths not preserved.

00:03:56.011 --> 00:03:58.591
And we've seen this in
multiple videos already.

00:03:58.591 --> 00:04:01.337
But in a dilation, angles are preserved.

00:04:01.337 --> 00:04:03.420
Angles preserved.

00:04:04.988 --> 00:04:06.642
So already we've lost our segment lengths

00:04:06.642 --> 00:04:08.168
but we still got our angles.

00:04:08.168 --> 00:04:10.743
Then we have a rotation
about another point Q.

00:04:10.743 --> 00:04:12.708
So this is a rigid transformation,

00:04:12.708 --> 00:04:14.460
it would preserve both but we've already

00:04:14.460 --> 00:04:15.907
lost our segment lengths.

00:04:15.907 --> 00:04:18.840
But angles are going to
continue to be preserved.

00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:21.636
And then finally a
reflection which is still

00:04:21.636 --> 00:04:24.065
a rigid transformation and
it would preserve both,

00:04:24.065 --> 00:04:26.002
but once again our
segment lengths got lost

00:04:26.002 --> 00:04:28.716
through the dilation but we will preserve,

00:04:28.716 --> 00:04:30.959
continue to preserve the angles.

00:04:30.959 --> 00:04:34.663
So in this series of after
these three transformations,

00:04:34.663 --> 00:04:36.722
the only thing that's
going to be preserved

00:04:36.722 --> 00:04:38.635
are going to be your angles.
