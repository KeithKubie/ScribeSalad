00:00:01.100 --> 00:00:05.000
Hi my name is Nomaguchi from Gourmet Innovation. Thank you for coming today.

00:00:07.100 --> 00:00:12.000
First things first, I would like to talk about the service Takumen.com.

00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:18.000
When you say Ramen, the first thing people think of is Cup noodles or those often sold at supermarkets.

00:00:18.100 --> 00:00:24.000
For example, those sold at the supermarket that uses a famous ramen shop such as "Ippudo" in their packaging with the catchphrase "Experience the exact taste as the famous restaurant”.

00:00:25.100 --> 00:00:33.000
These products sold at the supermarket are basically soup made at the factory that imitates the flavor of the ramen.

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:42.000
Most of them are the types where you would dilute the flavor with hot water.

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:45.000
The biggest distinction Takumen.com has with its ramen is

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:52.000
that the concepts lies on delivering the ramen exactly from the restaurant to the consumer's doorstep.

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:56.000
What this means is that, and this isn't a joke or anything

00:00:57.100 --> 00:01:02.000
but we put the soup from the restaurant in a special bag

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:13.000
and put the chashuu from the restaurant in a bag, and we freeze this, and send it to your house.

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:21.000
The same goes with the noodles, we freeze the ones they serve at the restaurant.

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:24.000
With the delivered frozen soup and chashuu

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:31.000
you can boil water and let it defreeze like what you would do with a Bon Curry.

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:36.000
When you put the ingredients in there and warm it up, the soup defrosts and it will get warm.

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:44.000
When this happens, of course, you will be able to enjoy the exact same soup you have at the restaurant.

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:52.000
What we still struggle with up to this day, is that when we explain "It is the exact taste as the restaurant”.

00:01:54.100 --> 00:02:03.000
People think that it is the same as frozen products where they imitate the taste and sell at the super market

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:13.000
but the products we deliver are, in all truth, is ramen that the restaurant owner or the staff actually make.

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:26.000
Currently, our Takumen.com website only offers ramen from about 100 famous ramen restaurants from Hokkaido up north to Kyushuu down south.

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:39.000
From here, we store the frozen products sent from the ramen shops at our refrigerating warehouse in Hamamatsu Shizuoka, and stock it there.

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:53.000
When the end user clicks to make a purchase at the Takumen.com site, when you click by 9AM, it will be delivered to your house as early as the following day.

00:02:53.100 --> 00:03:09.000
You can say it is very primitive, and we don't use the newest technology, and our name does say Takumen.com but we are not an IT company.

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:13.000
It is simply a company that started with one simple idea.

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:19.000
I would like to talk about how we started out the company.

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:32.000
I originally worked at a hotel overseas, and after returning to Japan, I opened a restaurant.

00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:41.000
After this, about 10 years, I had 3 restaurants. I still have them today.

00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:51.000
I unexpectedly met with my batch mate from middle school and high school.

00:03:52.100 --> 00:04:00.000
This guy was the so-called IT guy. He was there ever since the start up of Cyber Agent when there were only 5 people

00:04:01.100 --> 00:04:13.000
After this he became a director at Traffic Gate, and when they were bought by Rakuten, right when he was thinking of quitting, we happen to meet up

00:04:13.100 --> 00:04:24.000
When we were talking about what he would do after, we talked about the business model of Takumen.com and I instantly thought it was a fun idea

00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:40.000
After about 3 days this, we prepared to start the company, and within 2 weeks of meeting again, we registered the company. This was in 2010 when we started the company

00:04:42.100 --> 00:04:53.000
without any strategy or thinking about our chances of succeeding, with just the idea, and our optimism, we started a company in 2010.

00:04:55.100 --> 00:04:59.000
After this, sorry my story goes back and forth.

00:04:59.100 --> 00:05:08.000
When I was running my restaurant business, it is different from the products that everyone does.

00:05:09.100 --> 00:05:15.000
It isn't the kind of business where leverage is effective, and it is a labor intensive business.

00:05:15.100 --> 00:05:22.000
And the profit it makes can only go up so much, and economies of scale does not work on it very well either.

00:05:23.100 --> 00:05:29.000
It is a type of business where when you make a mistake, the already small profit can all disappear.

00:05:30.100 --> 00:05:35.000
During this time, when I looked at IT companies, I would envy them while I looked at their financial statement.

00:05:36.100 --> 00:05:53.000
During this time, I was running 3 restaurants, and when I opened my fourth one called Sakurajousui, I had to close it after about a year.

00:05:53.100 --> 00:06:06.000
At the beginning, it was featured on TC, and had some popularity, and it was thriving for a bit, but suddenly customers stopped coming, and the store closed in a year.

00:06:06.100 --> 00:06:11.000
I spent about 10 million yen on this business.

00:06:12.100 --> 00:06:23.000
What I thought about it was, other people would resign from work, and ask for money from their relatives or borrow money from many different places to collect the 10 million yen

00:06:24.100 --> 00:06:30.000
they would start a shop with the 10 million yen they worked hard to collect, but a lot of them would have to close their places.

00:06:30.100 --> 00:06:44.000
For myself, the 10 million that I spent for a store I closed was through a company, but I felt that there would be people who felt that their life ends when they go through this

00:06:44.100 --> 00:06:48.804
because it is a kind of business where when you get the location wrong, there is no way to turn things around.

00:06:49.100 --> 00:06:59.000
Even if you think that you can succeed, once you open, even when you start thinking "maybe I could have done this like this", it is an industry where you cannot get that back.

00:06:59.100 --> 00:07:09.000
What I vaguely thought of at the time was that I wanted to help restaurant who had the aspiration to serve delicious food and were serious about their craft

00:07:09.100 --> 00:07:17.000
even when they fail at their location, they will still be able to sell their product.

00:07:18.100 --> 00:07:27.000
So when I met up with Inoue who was my batchmate, when I heard the idea, I instantly thought it was an incredible idea.

00:07:28.100 --> 00:07:33.000
First, we had to choose a place that was very hard for others to overcome.

00:07:34.100 --> 00:07:42.000
What we thought of was that in the world, there were people who had the ambition to work really hard to create really good ramen for people to enjoy.

00:07:42.100 --> 00:07:54.000
And a lot of them would not succeed just because of mismatch in location or were not able to get into trends.

00:07:55.100 --> 00:08:06.000
What I instantly felt was that, as cliché as it sounds, I wanted to shed light to them and help them in a positive way

00:08:06.100 --> 00:08:10.000
and at this moment I wanted to do it.

00:08:10.100 --> 00:08:12.000
This was the catalyst.

00:08:14.100 --> 00:08:23.000
And as I have said, from the hotel to running a restaurant, I was the epitome of anti IT.

00:08:25.100 --> 00:08:32.000
When we started Takumen.com, a lot of people from the IT industry found our company interesting, and would visit our office.

00:08:33.100 --> 00:08:38.000
What I thought back then was how different type of species we were.

00:08:38.100 --> 00:08:49.000
For example, they would be googling things on their computer while making conversation, and at 2010, it wasn't something that I have ever done.

00:08:50.100 --> 00:08:56.000
I was extremely anti-IT that I was culture shocked and thought "Why would you go on a computer while you talk to another person”.

00:08:57.100 --> 00:09:08.000
Then I started to be influenced, and people in the restaurant business were not like that, and I would be wearing a suit, and make conversation while doing something on my computer

00:09:09.100 --> 00:09:11.000
and Ramen shop owners would see me that way.

00:09:12.100 --> 00:09:14.000
They would start treating me as an IT being.

00:09:15.100 --> 00:09:21.000
I still don't know much about IT, but at that time I was very culture shocked.

00:09:23.100 --> 00:09:27.000
I would try to always put dotcom in the service.

00:09:29.100 --> 00:09:32.000
This was the kind of level I started off at.

00:09:34.100 --> 00:09:38.000
We really just created a company with an idea.

00:09:38.100 --> 00:09:46.000
We weren't even thinking about how we would freeze the ramen, or who would do it, or even the logistics of it

00:09:48.100 --> 00:09:51.000
or how we would make the website, we did had not decided on anything.

00:09:53.100 --> 00:10:00.000
Every night, we would just drink and talk, and before you know it had already been a month.

00:10:01.100 --> 00:10:05.000
At the beginning, looking back, it was like a big joke.

00:10:06.100 --> 00:10:14.000
We would rent a truck go around to ramen shops, and we would get a whole pot of soup, and we would go to a garage and we would try to make ramen.

00:10:14.100 --> 00:10:16.000
we had no plan at all.

00:10:17.100 --> 00:10:23.000
while we were doing this, we were gonna do this, we were just gonna do this.

00:10:26.100 --> 00:10:34.000
This may sound self glorifying but Inoue, the IT guy, and I had a very interesting chemistry.

00:10:35.100 --> 00:10:40.000
I was an extreme old school sales person.

00:10:41.100 --> 00:10:44.000
On the other hand, Inoue was an extreme introvert.

00:10:45.100 --> 00:10:52.000
He wasn't very good at talking to other people, but he was at the top of his game when it came to marketing and IT.

00:10:53.100 --> 00:10:59.000
I think it was most interesting for two people that were extreme opposites to come together and create a service.

00:11:02.100 --> 00:11:11.100
First off, I asked Inoue to create the site, and let him handle that, but of course with the help of outsourced resources.

00:11:11.100 --> 00:11:15.000
I kept on talking to Ramen shops first off, I asked Inoue to create the site, and let him handle that, but of course with the help of outsourced resources.

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:17.000
what I did was, I kept on talking to ramen shops.

00:11:19.100 --> 00:11:22.000
I assume everyone has a certain image of ramen shop owners

00:11:23.100 --> 00:11:27.000
but to be honest this image is true, and they are very intimidating.

00:11:28.100 --> 00:11:37.000
A lot of them were in gangs before, and there are those we collaborate with that would say vulgar things, and they are very intimidating.

00:11:38.100 --> 00:11:43.000
I personally don't like fights, and I was very scared when selling the business to them.

00:11:44.100 --> 00:11:50.000
What a lot of people that I talked to about the business model are surprised about is that

00:11:51.100 --> 00:11:56.000
how was I able to convince these ramen shops.

00:11:56.100 --> 00:12:01.000
I didn't have anything special

00:12:02.100 --> 00:12:08.000
I simply made a list and called all of them from top to bottom.

00:12:09.100 --> 00:12:15.000
Some would shout at me over the phone whilst I ask them 5 minutes of their time.

00:12:16.100 --> 00:12:24.000
I didn't have the experience of getting physically hit, but there were shouting, a lot of shouting actually.

00:12:25.100 --> 00:12:34.000
Hardship stories I have during the start up of the company was going to meet with intimidating ramen shop owners everyday.

00:12:34.100 --> 00:12:42.000
Of course, I also tried creative ways to approach them, such as going in as customer.

00:12:43.100 --> 00:12:55.000
After doing this, I would eat 7 to 8 bowls of ramen in a day, and would make exaggerated faces to show how much I enjoyed the ramen to make the owners feel good.

00:12:56.100 --> 00:13:02.000
I would then slowly and passionately talk to them

00:13:04.100 --> 00:13:09.000
then they would agree to try out the service, and from there we increased numbers.

00:13:10.100 --> 00:13:20.000
Up to this day, the most memorable tie was probably that we didn't even have a website or brochures but just verbally sold the service to them.

00:13:21.100 --> 00:13:27.000
I would just randomly show up, and some would tell me to go home, but I would go back the next day.

00:13:28.100 --> 00:13:30.000
A lot of people in the ramen industry

00:13:31.100 --> 00:13:44.000
used to be in gangs back in their day, and they are very scary, but once you become friendly with them, they take very good care of you.

00:13:46.100 --> 00:13:50.000
It sounds like an impossible job, but there are a lot of them that shout

00:13:51.100 --> 00:13:56.000
or when they are not in the mood would break their promises.

00:13:57.100 --> 00:14:02.000
But slowly, I think because it helped that my style in selling matched with them.

00:14:03.100 --> 00:14:14.000
We would passionately talk about society, and they would tell me that I was a good person, this is how we slowly got them to join.

00:14:15.100 --> 00:14:17.000
We opened the website.

00:14:18.100 --> 00:14:24.000
The company started in April, so the website was opened around July.

00:14:25.100 --> 00:14:27.000
At this time, we had 5 ramen shops registered.

00:14:28.100 --> 00:14:41.000
How we did it was we called up Rakuten sites that sold a similar kind of straight soup.

00:14:41.100 --> 00:14:44.000
What this is is that they were doing it by themselves, so we told them to sell it to us.

00:14:45.100 --> 00:14:52.000
What we noticed during this time, was Ramen shops is about the brand.

00:14:53.100 --> 00:14:55.000
What it is is that famous ramen has their branding.

00:14:56.100 --> 00:15:01.000
For example, for brands that have long waiting lines and become successful

00:15:02.100 --> 00:15:07.000
the owner gains confidence, then they would open a second shop.

00:15:07.100 --> 00:15:17.000
All of a sudden, even if you are selling the same thing, the customers would start to say that it doesn't taste as good, that it would not taste the same if it wasn't something that the owner made it himself.

00:15:17.100 --> 00:15:25.000
In conclusion, it is a very rare type of business where the more you increase the number of stores, the more you shed off the brand.

00:15:26.100 --> 00:15:28.000
It is very hard to expand.

00:15:29.100 --> 00:15:35.000
The branding of each store is very strong

00:15:35.100 --> 00:15:42.000
but, let's say, it is very hard to sell all over the country with simply the brand.

00:15:42.100 --> 00:15:46.000
I'm not sure how many are ramen enthusiasts here but

00:15:46.100 --> 00:15:52.000
in the 100 stores that Takumen sells in, I don't think there are a lot of people who know this but

00:15:52.100 --> 00:16:07.000
even if you know famous ones such as Ippudo or Ichiran, for example, there is a store in Shinjuu called Fuunji that specializes in tsukemen, and up to today, it still takes up to 1 hour lining up, but I think a lot of people still don't know about it.

00:16:08.100 --> 00:16:19.000
When you think about this, we collect the brands, and use this brand to gather customers.

00:16:19.100 --> 00:16:26.000
Each one is weak, but once you get them together, it can make an interesting business.

00:16:26.100 --> 00:16:28.000
At the beginning, there wasn't a plan or anything

00:16:28.100 --> 00:16:32.000
but slowly, things built up

00:16:34.100 --> 00:16:38.000
and now, we gather a lot of famous stores.

00:16:38.100 --> 00:16:42.000
A lot of them have very strong brands

00:16:43.100 --> 00:16:47.000
and from there, the website's strength to attract customers grew.

00:16:48.100 --> 00:16:51.000
Ramen shops as individuals are not very effective

00:16:51.100 --> 00:16:53.000
but when we gather them together, this is something that we can do

00:16:54.100 --> 00:16:58.000
and it something that we gradually achieved.

00:17:00.100 --> 00:17:07.000
It seems boastful, but it isn't as if we make a lot of profit.

00:17:08.100 --> 00:17:15.000
The first time we did it, it was actually very similar to the business that I had struggled in the past where it is very labor-intensive.

00:17:15.100 --> 00:17:17.000
The first time we started, it was like that.

00:17:18.100 --> 00:17:21.000
Up to now, it isn't that we are an IT company.

00:17:21.100 --> 00:17:33.000
We still have the sales representatives use a phone and talk to individual stores use old school methods.

00:17:34.100 --> 00:17:42.000
But, after 6 years, something happened that we never thought would at the beginning.

00:17:42.100 --> 00:17:50.000
There have been shops that call us up and tell us they want to be on Takumen, I wouldn't say it happens everyday, but it happens often.

00:17:50.100 --> 00:17:55.000
But we actually only feature famous stores, so we have turned them down.

00:17:56.100 --> 00:18:00.000
We have to tell them that "we don't want you", but lately, it's been something hard to do.

00:18:00.100 --> 00:18:10.000
We always think of how we will turn them down, and what I often do is, I tell them we get a lot of inquiries and we want to talk to each one of them and tell them to wait.

00:18:10.100 --> 00:18:20.000
We tell very vaguely, and we take up time and just wait out until they forget about it.

00:18:27.100 --> 00:18:33.000
A failure story we had at the beginning, well, it is more of a hardship than a failure.

00:18:33.100 --> 00:18:37.000
As mentioned earlier, was to gather ramen shops.

00:18:38.100 --> 00:18:44.000
The next thing was that I only had experience in the restaurant business

00:18:44.100 --> 00:18:49.000
and I had never worked at an start-up.

00:18:49.100 --> 00:19:03.000
My partner Inoue, saw Cyber Agent grow from a start-up with 5 people to becoming a top player

00:19:03.100 --> 00:19:07.000
even with Traffic Gate which I didn't know about

00:19:07.100 --> 00:19:10.000
had a large expansion with they started up.

00:19:10.100 --> 00:19:21.000
This is the kind of experience he had, and I looked up to Inoue who had quite the experience with startups.

00:19:21.100 --> 00:19:28.000
I always thought of startups as cool, and I fantasized about telling my friends of being in a startup

00:19:28.100 --> 00:19:31.000
and this is actually partially why I started one

00:19:33.100 --> 00:19:43.000
and to my surprise, Inoue started recruiting people one after the other, telling me this is the way of the startup world.

00:19:43.100 --> 00:19:52.000
In the restaurant business, how much you can lower the fixed cost you had would impact how much you could increase the very little profit you made.

00:19:52.100 --> 00:20:03.000
Apparently, in the startup world, it was common knowledge that the more you brought in talented individuals, the higher your profit would be.

00:20:03.100 --> 00:20:08.000
Then I thought, alright, and went along with recruiting people.

00:20:08.100 --> 00:20:17.000
People found the combination of ramen and not really IT individuals, but let's say, the combination of ramen and the internet interesting.

00:20:18.100 --> 00:20:29.000
One of the reasons behind Takumen's popularity is that we didn't have money to spend on marketing, and we weren't able to advertise.

00:20:30.100 --> 00:20:32.000
So what Inoue did was

00:20:32.100 --> 00:20:38.000
2010 was a time when Twitter became popular and a lot of people were on it

00:20:39.100 --> 00:20:43.000
what he did was he started to research on Takumen on Twitter.

00:20:44.100 --> 00:20:49.000
He started a marketing strategy by calling up people who Tweeted about Takumen

00:20:49.100 --> 00:20:51.000
and this was a strange way

00:20:52.100 --> 00:20:57.000
but once he did that, we had an office in Shibuya,

00:20:57.100 --> 00:21:02.000
people started spreading that if you Tweet about Takumen, you would get to eat free ramen.

00:21:03.100 --> 00:21:09.000
The circle became bigger, and even famous Presidents of companies found interest in it.

00:21:09.100 --> 00:21:16.000
After about half a year since starting the company, we would have business owners come in everyday.

00:21:17.100 --> 00:21:19.000
Some would be sketchy middle aged men too.

00:21:19.100 --> 00:21:27.000
So, once we did this marketing of making ramen at the office, and having them Tweet about how good it was.

00:21:28.100 --> 00:21:31.000
Although we didn't spend a dime on it, the word just spread.

00:21:32.100 --> 00:21:38.000
Most likely, this is the most rare phenomenon we had

00:21:39.100 --> 00:21:49.000
with this, since I believed in the startup myth that Inoue told me about profits increasing if you hire talented people

00:21:49.100 --> 00:21:53.000
and the more Tweets about Takumen and people coming to the office

00:21:54.100 --> 00:21:58.000
a lot of people who were talented and experienced wanted to work at Takumen.

00:21:59.100 --> 00:22:07.000
It is unbelievable, there were people that graduated from Tokyo University and worked at Accenture and wanted to work for us.

00:22:07.100 --> 00:22:11.000
S lot of them wanted to make Takumen bigger and let people know about it.

00:22:12.100 --> 00:22:14.000
We then recruited them one after the other.

00:22:15.100 --> 00:22:18.000
I started to worry if this was a good move

00:22:18.100 --> 00:22:22.000
but in actuality, it was not good at all

00:22:23.100 --> 00:22:25.000
and it didn't have anything to do with being a startup.

00:22:26.100 --> 00:22:33.000
I am not trying to brag, but our sales was barely hitting the 1 million mark

00:22:33.100 --> 00:22:35.000
and we had 9 people

00:22:36.100 --> 00:22:42.000
but Inoue said that startups are like this, at the beginning you would wait it out, and eventually it will hit it big.

00:22:42.100 --> 00:22:45.000
And whilst I was being convinced by this, we were losing a lot of money

00:22:45.100 --> 00:22:49.000
even when we kept on valuating and increasing our funds

00:22:49.100 --> 00:22:53.000
we lost about 4 million yen a month.

00:22:53.100 --> 00:22:54.000
just like that, we lost money.

00:22:55.100 --> 00:23:00.000
I said, "we only made 1 million this month, we have a deficit of 4 million, what are we going to do?”

00:23:00.100 --> 00:23:05.000
Then the IT guy says, "we will be fine"

00:23:05.100 --> 00:23:08.000
but It wasn't fine.

00:23:09.100 --> 00:23:14.000
When we realized we would lose the company if we didn't do something

00:23:15.100 --> 00:23:20.000
we largely shrunk our size.

00:23:20.100 --> 00:23:24.000
The freezing warehouse that we were outsourcing

00:23:25.100 --> 00:23:28.000
the one we used to store the ramen we were sent

00:23:29.100 --> 00:23:30.000
we would do "picking" ourselves

00:23:32.100 --> 00:23:34.000
which is basically packing the products.

00:23:34.100 --> 00:23:37.000
We were initially outsourcing this part of sending them to the customers

00:23:38.100 --> 00:23:40.398
but since we didn't have the money, we decided to do it ourselves.

00:23:40.606 --> 00:23:47.530
We bought a large freezer in a warehouse in Koto-ward

00:23:47.989 --> 00:23:52.034
and we would go there.

00:23:52.285 --> 00:23:54.787
The first thing we would do was change in our ski wear

00:23:54.871 --> 00:23:59.041
go into the freezer that was minus 20 degrees

00:23:59.125 --> 00:24:03.546
and it was a level where you would probably die if you stayed in it too long.

00:24:03.671 --> 00:24:07.550
Even with the ski wear, we would wear a helmet.

00:24:08.100 --> 00:24:14.000
First, when we go in the morning, we would take the orders, and put it in boxes ourselves.

00:24:15.100 --> 00:24:19.000
The boxes would be then taken by the delivery company

00:24:19.312 --> 00:24:21.000
and then taken to the customer.

00:24:22.100 --> 00:24:28.000
At this time, since Takumen was already quite known

00:24:28.100 --> 00:24:34.000
we would put things like "Delivery Center" or "Freezing Center"

00:24:35.100 --> 00:24:39.000
as if we had an actual division that took care of the freezer.

00:24:40.100 --> 00:24:45.000
We would also write "Customer Center" even though we would only have 1 telephone, and we all took turns in answering calls.

00:24:46.100 --> 00:24:49.000
There were only about 3 or 4 people, and we did everything.

00:24:50.100 --> 00:24:54.000
We managed to survive

00:24:55.100 --> 00:25:01.000
that was when we realized this is what a startup is.

00:25:01.100 --> 00:25:07.000
Well it was too late at the time, and we were just taking it one step at a time

00:25:07.100 --> 00:25:10.000
we were even wondering if we would survive.

00:25:11.100 --> 00:25:15.000
But by just working diligently, we realized that profits do go up

00:25:15.100 --> 00:25:19.000
and it really did go up little by little.

00:25:19.100 --> 00:25:26.000
As of now, the numbers aren't that high

00:25:27.100 --> 00:25:37.000
but in a day we would get 300 orders, 200, 300, or 400 orders.

00:25:38.100 --> 00:25:40.000
It might be a small number

00:25:41.100 --> 00:25:48.000
but with just a fantasy that was between friends turned into something where people buy.

00:25:48.100 --> 00:25:50.000
This was something very pleasing.

00:25:51.100 --> 00:25:58.000
Up to now, we still want as many people as possible to enjoy eating through Takumen.

00:25:58.100 --> 00:26:02.000
We still need to work hard.

00:26:08.100 --> 00:26:10.000
I've cut out a lot of things

00:26:11.100 --> 00:26:16.000
but lastly, I would like to talk about the the value of Takumen.com

00:26:16.100 --> 00:26:21.000
what our strength in the business is.

00:26:22.100 --> 00:26:26.000
In Japan, there are about 40,000 ramen shops

00:26:26.100 --> 00:26:35.000
4000 shops that is 10% close each year, and another 10% open

00:26:36.100 --> 00:26:38.000
in a year, there is a shifting of 4000 shops.

00:26:42.100 --> 00:26:46.000
There is no other industry like this

00:26:46.100 --> 00:26:52.000
There are 40,000 shops and including cup noodles the market size is 700 billion.

00:26:53.100 --> 00:26:56.000
I'm not sure about the numbers.

00:26:56.100 --> 00:27:00.000
there are 700 billion, I think 700 billion.

00:27:00.100 --> 00:27:05.000
The restaurant that has the top share

00:27:05.100 --> 00:27:07.000
I don't know if you call it a ramen shop

00:27:08.100 --> 00:27:12.000
is Korakuen who sells 290 yen ramen.

00:27:12.100 --> 00:27:16.000
It takes up to 20 to 30 billion.

00:27:17.100 --> 00:27:22.000
The top share in a market size of 700 billion industry is 20 billion.

00:27:23.100 --> 00:27:24.000
What does this mean?

00:27:24.100 --> 00:27:29.000
We later realized that the ramen industry does not have a federator.

00:27:29.100 --> 00:27:32.000
What this means is that it is a collection of individual shops.

00:27:33.100 --> 00:27:36.000
The collection of individual shops is the ramen industry.

00:27:37.100 --> 00:27:39.000
It means there isn't a big player.

00:27:41.100 --> 00:27:43.000
We didn't really mean this to happen at the beginning.

00:27:44.100 --> 00:27:50.000
When we realized that the ramen industry did not have a big player, there isn't anyone that doesn't know Takumen.

00:27:51.100 --> 00:27:53.000
It maybe an exaggeration

00:27:53.100 --> 00:27:56.000
but it is very well recognized.

00:27:56.100 --> 00:28:01.000
What this means is that, for the first time, we had federated the ramen industry.

00:28:03.100 --> 00:28:06.000
Famous ramen shops, ramen shops that have long lines.

00:28:07.100 --> 00:28:14.000
I don't think there is anyone else that makes it easy to contact these places other than us.

00:28:15.100 --> 00:28:22.000
It is something we didn't expect, we just worked hard on selling and before we knew it, it just became this big.

00:28:23.100 --> 00:28:25.000
We realized it had great value.

00:28:27.100 --> 00:28:31.000
Why did we realize this? Because we started getting calls from overseas.

00:28:33.100 --> 00:28:37.000
We would receive emails from a rich person from Dubai

00:28:38.100 --> 00:28:42.000
and they would say that they wanted to bring Japanese ramen to their place, but they don't know how to start.

00:28:43.100 --> 00:28:46.000
What it meant was from foreign countries

00:28:47.100 --> 00:28:49.000
they are very interested in ramen

00:28:50.100 --> 00:28:52.000
but they don't know who to talk to about it

00:28:53.100 --> 00:28:58.000
because there isn't a big player, and there wasn't a company that federated them.

00:28:58.100 --> 00:29:01.000
When they started doing their research they stumbled upon Takumen

00:29:02.100 --> 00:29:04.000
they said that it looked like it connected a lot of ramen stores.

00:29:05.100 --> 00:29:07.000
At the beginning, inquiries like this would come once in a while

00:29:08.100 --> 00:29:11.000
then it came from different parts of the world.

00:29:11.100 --> 00:29:17.000
What we realized was that Japanese ramen was really popular.

00:29:18.100 --> 00:29:22.000
Another thing was that we became the first federators.

00:29:23.100 --> 00:29:27.000
Sorry but I’ll talk for 5 more minutes.

00:29:28.100 --> 00:29:33.000
But we’ve brought some frozen ramen from Takumen.

00:29:34.100 --> 00:29:36.000
There maybe some people who are already full but

00:29:37.100 --> 00:29:39.000
we weren't sure how many people would come.

00:29:40.100 --> 00:29:42.000
so please those who win rock, paper scissors can eat them.

00:29:43.100 --> 00:29:44.000
How many people do we have here?

00:29:47.100 --> 00:29:49.000
About 10 you can probably divide 1 into 2.

00:29:50.100 --> 00:29:55.000
There is 4 for each, we have 4 each of tsukemen and ramen, and there are 8 of them.

00:29:56.100 --> 00:30:01.000
What should we do, maybe ladies can eat first?

00:30:02.947 --> 00:30:07.326
Or I think we might actually have more than enough.

00:30:07.368 --> 00:30:12.331
Please if you like, eat some before it gets too soft. I'll finish in about 5 more minutes.

00:30:12.748 --> 00:30:15.584
Please take some for those who want to try.

00:30:19.100 --> 00:30:22.000
You can just take a bite and leave the rest.

00:30:23.100 --> 00:30:26.000
What I wanted you to understand here is that

00:30:27.100 --> 00:30:32.000
it is a completely different product from the diluted soup sold in the super market.

00:30:33.100 --> 00:30:35.000
Please just take a bite and experience it.

00:30:37.100 --> 00:30:40.401
To continue from earlier,

00:30:40.490 --> 00:30:53.000
we received a lot of offers from around the world, and when we realized our strength of being the federator in the industry

00:30:55.100 --> 00:30:59.000
we came up with starting overseas.

00:30:59.100 --> 00:31:03.000
And we actually started 3 stores in Singapore.

00:31:04.100 --> 00:31:07.000
What kind of ramen stores are they?

00:31:08.100 --> 00:31:13.000
In one shop you can enjoy the ramen from famous ramen shops.

00:31:13.100 --> 00:31:17.000
We have a small ramen museum like place over there.

00:31:17.060 --> 00:31:18.440
This doesn't even exist in Japan.

00:31:19.100 --> 00:31:22.000
The reason is, it is very hard to make the soup

00:31:22.100 --> 00:31:26.000
then to make 7 types of soup cannot be done in 1 shop.

00:31:27.100 --> 00:31:35.000
But we have a central kitchen, and here we can make up to 7 types of soup, and we heat it up at the shop before serving.

00:31:36.100 --> 00:31:43.000
The owner of these 7 types of Japanese famous ramen shops give us the recipe for their ramen.

00:31:43.100 --> 00:31:50.000
The recipe is only second to their life, and they actually share it with us.

00:31:51.100 --> 00:31:55.000
The reason is, regardless of how famous one ramen store is

00:31:56.100 --> 00:31:58.000
it is hard for them to expand overseas.

00:31:58.100 --> 00:32:02.000
To open a shop, overseas is very difficult to achieve

00:32:02.100 --> 00:32:05.000
but we can go overseas on their behalf.

00:32:05.110 --> 00:32:08.364
When we tell them that we will make it for them if they share the recipe

00:32:08.447 --> 00:32:11.909
what they tell us is "if it's with Takumen then we will”.

00:32:12.100 --> 00:32:15.955
I'm not quite sure how far I can share but

00:32:16.100 --> 00:32:19.000
we ask them without spending the initial cost.

00:32:20.100 --> 00:32:26.000
This is actually unbelievable because we are able to ask for the recipe of ramen shops for free.

00:32:26.100 --> 00:32:30.844
This is something that we can do because of our position we take.

00:32:31.595 --> 00:32:43.000
Currently, we are slowly spreading the model of serving 7 different ramen from famous ramen shops in one place.

00:32:44.100 --> 00:32:51.000
After Singapore, next is Vietnam, then we go to Thailand, America, and then Europe.

00:32:52.100 --> 00:32:56.000
We aspire to spread this model all over the world.

00:32:57.100 --> 00:33:02.000
Currently, we do business overseas and locally in Nihonbashi.

00:33:03.100 --> 00:33:07.000
Our vision for the future is that we want to be ramen kings.

00:33:08.100 --> 00:33:15.000
We go by the motto of becoming the ramen kings in the world, and we would like to take up different challenges around the world.

00:33:17.100 --> 00:33:20.000
My story ends here.
