00:00:06.818 --> 00:00:07.888
You might think you know a lot

00:00:07.888 --> 00:00:10.368
about Native Americans through popular movies,

00:00:10.368 --> 00:00:10.820
books,

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:11.987
and classes in school,

00:00:11.987 --> 00:00:14.812
but it turns out that a lot of what we think we know

00:00:14.812 --> 00:00:17.016
about famous Native American figures

00:00:17.016 --> 00:00:18.106
isn't quite right.

00:00:18.106 --> 00:00:20.203
Take Sacajawea for example.

00:00:20.203 --> 00:00:21.327
You probably remember her

00:00:21.327 --> 00:00:23.825
as a beautiful Indian woman who lived an exotic life

00:00:23.825 --> 00:00:25.408
serving as the all-knowing guide

00:00:25.408 --> 00:00:28.170
for Lewis and Clark's famous expedition, right?

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:30.799
Well, that's not exactly how it happened.

00:00:30.799 --> 00:00:33.759
Not much is known about Sacajawea's early childhood,

00:00:33.759 --> 00:00:36.518
but we do know that she was born in 1788

00:00:36.518 --> 00:00:37.847
into the Agaidika Tribe

00:00:37.847 --> 00:00:41.016
of the Lemhi Shoshone in what is now Idaho.

00:00:41.016 --> 00:00:43.292
In 1800, when she was about 12 years old,

00:00:43.292 --> 00:00:45.528
Sacajawea and several other girls

00:00:45.528 --> 00:00:48.280
were kidnapped by a group of Hidatsa Indians.

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:50.563
She was taken as a captive to a Hidatsa village

00:00:50.563 --> 00:00:52.274
in present-day North Dakota.

00:00:52.274 --> 00:00:55.509
Then, she was sold to a French Canadian fur trapper

00:00:55.509 --> 00:00:57.411
named Toussaint Charbonneau.

00:00:57.411 --> 00:00:58.528
Within a year or so,

00:00:58.528 --> 00:01:01.269
she was pregnant with her first child.

00:01:01.269 --> 00:01:02.794
Soon after she became pregnant,

00:01:02.794 --> 00:01:05.868
the Corps of Discovery arrived near the Hidatsa villages.

00:01:05.868 --> 00:01:07.957
Captains Meriwether Lewis and William Clark

00:01:07.957 --> 00:01:09.399
built Fort Mandan there,

00:01:09.399 --> 00:01:10.735
and then started interviewing people

00:01:10.735 --> 00:01:13.169
to help guide them on their perilous expedition.

00:01:13.169 --> 00:01:16.189
They agreed to hire Sacajawea's husband, Charbonneau,

00:01:16.189 --> 00:01:18.185
with the understanding that his lovely wife

00:01:18.185 --> 00:01:20.764
would also come along as an interpreter.

00:01:20.764 --> 00:01:22.695
They figured her very presence would help

00:01:22.695 --> 00:01:25.318
any encounters with native tribes along the way.

00:01:25.318 --> 00:01:26.894
As Clark noted in his journal,

00:01:26.894 --> 00:01:28.590
"A woman with a party of men

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:30.629
is a token of peace."

00:01:30.629 --> 00:01:32.897
Shortly thereafter, Sacajawea gave birth

00:01:32.897 --> 00:01:35.986
to a little boy named Jean Baptiste Charbonneau.

00:01:35.986 --> 00:01:37.867
Clark called him Pompy.

00:01:37.867 --> 00:01:40.122
She carried Pompy on a board strapped to her back

00:01:40.122 --> 00:01:42.739
as the Corps of Discovery forged on.

00:01:42.739 --> 00:01:44.446
Besides interpreting the language

00:01:44.446 --> 00:01:46.568
when Lewis and Clark encountered Indians,

00:01:46.568 --> 00:01:49.673
Sacajawea's activities as a member of the Corps

00:01:49.673 --> 00:01:51.218
included digging for roots,

00:01:51.218 --> 00:01:52.671
collecting edible plants,

00:01:52.671 --> 00:01:54.044
and picking berries.

00:01:54.044 --> 00:01:57.650
In 1805, the boat they were riding in was capsized.

00:01:57.650 --> 00:01:59.049
She dove into the water,

00:01:59.049 --> 00:02:01.455
recovering all the important papers and supplies

00:02:01.455 --> 00:02:03.007
that would otherwise have been lost,

00:02:03.007 --> 00:02:05.899
including the journals and records of Lewis and Clark.

00:02:05.899 --> 00:02:08.396
Later that year, Captain Lewis and three men

00:02:08.396 --> 00:02:11.735
scouted 75 miles ahead of the expedition's main party,

00:02:11.735 --> 00:02:13.526
crossing the Continental Divide.

00:02:13.526 --> 00:02:16.274
The next day they encountered a group of Shishones.

00:02:16.274 --> 00:02:19.057
Not only did they prove to be Sacajawea's band,

00:02:19.057 --> 00:02:20.952
but their leader, Chief Cameahwait,

00:02:20.952 --> 00:02:24.310
turned out to be her very own brother.

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:25.786
After five years of separation

00:02:25.786 --> 00:02:27.703
since her kidnapping as a young girl,

00:02:27.703 --> 00:02:31.420
Sacajawea and Cameahwait had an emotional reunion.

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:33.598
Unfortunately, she quickly had to bid farewell

00:02:33.598 --> 00:02:34.947
to her beloved brother

00:02:34.947 --> 00:02:36.938
and continue on with the journey.

00:02:36.938 --> 00:02:40.385
At one point, the expedition became so difficult and freezing,

00:02:40.385 --> 00:02:43.765
the group was reduced to eating candles to survive.

00:02:43.765 --> 00:02:45.931
When temperatures finally became more bearable,

00:02:45.931 --> 00:02:48.818
Sacajawea found, dug, and cooked roots

00:02:48.818 --> 00:02:51.188
to help the group regain their strength.

00:02:51.188 --> 00:02:52.235
On the return trip,

00:02:52.235 --> 00:02:55.319
they encountered an Indian wearing a beautiful fur robe.

00:02:55.319 --> 00:02:56.987
Lewis and Clark wanted to bring the robe

00:02:56.987 --> 00:02:58.898
to Thomas Jefferson as a gift

00:02:58.898 --> 00:03:00.652
but had nothing to trade for it.

00:03:00.652 --> 00:03:02.730
So, Sacajawea agreed to trade

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:05.535
her most precious possession, her beaded belt,

00:03:05.535 --> 00:03:06.734
for the fur.

00:03:06.734 --> 00:03:10.455
A little over two years after the expedition began,

00:03:10.455 --> 00:03:11.690
it was finally over,

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:13.729
ending in St. Louis.

00:03:13.729 --> 00:03:16.509
Today, we learn about Sacajawea in school

00:03:16.509 --> 00:03:18.159
as a heroic guide,

00:03:18.159 --> 00:03:20.275
but her life, like most everyone's,

00:03:20.275 --> 00:03:21.688
was much more complicated

00:03:21.688 --> 00:03:25.299
than history books sometimes give her credit for.
