You've arrived at another
practice session.

00:00:02.400 --> 00:00:05.100
This time we'll be revisiting
the robot maze application, and

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:07.740
adding new features that gives
our robot the ability to

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:10.450
think more intelligently
about the world around it.

00:00:10.450 --> 00:00:14.250
We'll do this by exercising all the new
things we've learned about control flow

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:14.890
and methods.
