00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:04.350
A.I. might be a human-destroying killer, but
without ANY A.I., the world wouldn't be a

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:12.980
very awesome place.

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:17.589
Stephen Hawking famously said to the BBC,
"The development of full artificial intelligence

00:00:17.589 --> 00:00:20.339
could spell the end of the human race[1]."

00:00:20.339 --> 00:00:23.390
Elon Musk has said it's like, "summoning the
demon[2]."

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:28.019
And yet, earlier this month, Elon Musk, Stephen
Hawking and important minds from around the

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:33.390
world signed an open letter from the Future
of Life Institute encouraging a future for

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:34.410
the technology.

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:38.320
The letter was widely interpreted by the media[3],[4]
to indicate these super-smart peeps are saying

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:42.820
A.I. is going to KILL US ALL, but that's not
entirely accurate.

00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:47.490
It says, right in the open letter[5], "The
potential benefits are huge, since everything

00:00:47.490 --> 00:00:51.690
that civilization has to offer is a product
of human intelligence," what they ARE saying

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:56.010
is how A.I. may change the way we live, work,
and affect the planet.

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:59.970
A.I. could solve problems in ways we can't
conceive, and if done right might create a

00:00:59.970 --> 00:01:02.650
better world for us in the process!

00:01:02.650 --> 00:01:05.530
Might, being the operative word here…

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:10.039
At the moment, A.I. isn't dangerous in itself
unless you're living in the realms of films

00:01:10.039 --> 00:01:11.560
and television.

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:15.889
The open letter is some of the greatest humans
NOW wanting to make sure the A.I. of the FUTURE

00:01:15.889 --> 00:01:19.340
will be programmed to concern human safety.

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:24.630
Musk donated 10 million dollars alone to safety
of A.I.[6] because he knows: computers are

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:25.630
dumb.

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:29.299
We have to teach them morality, ethics and
empathy, just like we train it to drive, speak,

00:01:29.299 --> 00:01:31.159
move cargo or play piano.

00:01:31.159 --> 00:01:36.650
We have to recognize, the humans PROGRAMMING
the A.I. have biases.

00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:41.520
If we create a banking A.I. using current
lending data as data points, it might lend

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:46.619
more to white people than black people; because
of the racism of the people who "taught" the

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:47.619
computer!

00:01:47.619 --> 00:01:49.189
It's all in how we program it[7].

00:01:49.189 --> 00:01:53.399
This open letter acknowledges[8] that A.I.
is beneficial, and it it's a pledge to make

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:59.610
sure that's a priority in the future too.

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:04.090
Early A.I. work was mainly done by computer
scientists, but it's now interdisciplinary;

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:08.280
encompassing biology, medicine, law and ethics,
psychology and so on.

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:12.980
Researchers are saying A.I. should make the
world safer and pledging to that fact.

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:17.030
As of now, the most advanced artificial intelligences
are still pretty basic, working in areas like

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:22.490
language processing, photo and face recognition,
shipping and logistics, or in driverless cars.

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:26.850
To say these are "intelligent" isn't entirely
correct.

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:30.960
Though often A.I. do have some machine learning,
computers only know what we teach them.

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:36.310
For example, the brain of a driverless car
can take you to the store, but it can't shop

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:39.950
for groceries; the variables are completely
different.

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:44.920
As of 2013[9], the most advanced A.I. in the
world, according to Business Insider, was

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:45.920
ConceptNet4.

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:49.630
It was built by M.I.T. and had the intelligence
of a preschooler, it could explore a bit on

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:54.210
it's own, but mostly needed humans to input
information for it to learn.

00:02:54.210 --> 00:02:58.070
They're now up to ConceptNet5.3, and it's
a free download[10]!

00:02:58.070 --> 00:03:04.480
Sure, a full A.I. might be bad, but these
rudimentary A.I. are nothing but helpful and

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:07.840
should continue to be!

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:12.470
Stephen Hawking himself uses a computer with
type of A.I. to speak[11] called Assistive

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:14.730
Context Aware Toolkit (ACAT[12]).

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:18.940
It uses his previous writings and communication
to predict what he's going to want to say.

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:24.670
That doesn't sound too dangerous… and without
the A.I. being able to learn, it wouldn't

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:25.820
be much help.

00:03:25.820 --> 00:03:30.020
Hawking couldn't even TELL us to watch out
for A.I. without A.I.!!

00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:36.010
Hawking, Musk, and researchers from the largest
and smartest technology firms and universities

00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:39.780
in the world aren't saying, "Run for your
lives!"

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:42.120
They're saying "Run the right algorithms!"

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:45.430
What do you think about Artificial Intelligence?

00:03:45.430 --> 00:04:01.680
Would you 
want it?
