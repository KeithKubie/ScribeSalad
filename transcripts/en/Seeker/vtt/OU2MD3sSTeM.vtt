00:00:02.950 --> 00:00:13.190
WHAT ARE YOU TRYING TO DO?!

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:14.509
CHOKE ME WITH BACTERIA?!

00:00:14.509 --> 00:00:19.000
That glass of water you're drinking probably
contains 10 million bacteria.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:20.000
Yep.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:21.000
That's a lot.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.410
Researchers at Lund University in Sweden revealed
exactly how many bacteria is living in the

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:27.660
pipes that bring you drinking water.

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:32.230
According to their paper in Applied Microbiology
and Water Resources, our drinking water has

00:00:32.230 --> 00:00:36.800
eighty thousand bacteria per MILLILITER, and
a couple thousand more bacteria species in

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:38.010
the pipes themselves!

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:44.210
Using flow cytometry, a laser-based system,
scientists counted what was previously uncountable:

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:47.310
every tiny particle flowing through our water
pipes.

00:00:47.310 --> 00:00:52.050
Then using DNA sequencing, they uncovered
a huge diversity of bacteria lurking behind

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:53.110
our faucets.

00:00:53.110 --> 00:00:54.110
BUT DON'T FREAK OUT.

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:55.720
This is completely normal!

00:00:55.720 --> 00:00:57.899
This is like turning on the lights in a dark
room.

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:01.860
We knew stuff was going on around us, but
didn't know exactly what was involved.

00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:06.630
For example, in a 2013 issue of Water Science
and Technology, researchers isolated four

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:13.210
types of microorganisms commonly found in
drinking water: Sphingobium, Xenophilus, Methylobacterium,

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:14.700
and Rhodococcus.

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:19.259
These are mostly harmless genuses of bacteria
found in soil, on leaves and in lakes.

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:22.579
How'd it get from the Yukon to your glass?

00:01:22.579 --> 00:01:23.969
Naturally.

00:01:23.969 --> 00:01:27.920
Drinking water is fed by snow and rain which
streams down mountainsides to rivers where

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:32.479
it's pumped, diverted or dammed to provide
a supply of drinking water.

00:01:32.479 --> 00:01:37.149
Bacteria hitches a ride on that trip too,
all the way to your parched throat and beyond.

00:01:37.149 --> 00:01:40.270
The water is filtered between the lake and
your home though.

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:45.279
Water treatment plants use increasingly finer
meshes, sands, settling and aeration tanks

00:01:45.279 --> 00:01:52.680
to filter out particles, and often add chlorine,
or use ultraviolet light to kill any microorganisms.

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:57.590
The city of Hong Kong created a helpful graphic
to show how they add Alum, Lime, Chlorine,

00:01:57.590 --> 00:02:01.869
and polyelectrolytes, to clean and clarify
their water before sending it on to their

00:02:01.869 --> 00:02:02.869
citizens.

00:02:02.869 --> 00:02:05.150
They even add a bit of fluoride for dental
hygiene.

00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:09.170
Once out of the treatment plant though, the
water is exposed to bacteria once again…

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:10.390
in the pipes.

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:14.930
When left to it's own devices in an aqueous
environment, bacteria will form what's called

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:16.720
a biofilm.

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:23.709
Biofilms are like plaque on your teeth, or
kombucha… only less… no, about equally

00:02:23.709 --> 00:02:24.709
gross.

00:02:24.709 --> 00:02:26.959
And our water systems are FILLED with them.

00:02:26.959 --> 00:02:32.730
But again, don't freak out, think of these
films of bacteria like our gut microbiota,

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:34.310
most are good!

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:38.240
Researchers in the International Journal of
Environmental Health said biofilms "represent

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:39.959
the most successful form of life."

00:02:39.959 --> 00:02:44.439
Though gross looking, they're generally not
harmful; some are even healthful!

00:02:44.439 --> 00:02:49.329
In nature, they provide self-cleaning potential
for soils, sediments and water, but in our

00:02:49.329 --> 00:02:53.770
pipes biofilms may be trapping dangerous pathogens
before they get to you!

00:02:53.770 --> 00:02:59.879
Government agencies at every level test municipal
water supplies in order to keep citizens safe.

00:02:59.879 --> 00:03:04.049
No doubt this is partly why the United Nations'
Global Drinking Water Quality Index rates

00:03:04.049 --> 00:03:06.770
the US as having some of the best water in
the world.

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:11.680
But trying to make our systems 100-percent
"clean" -- that is bacteria free -- might

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:12.859
be damaging!

00:03:12.859 --> 00:03:16.719
According to Professor Catherine Biggs at
the University of Sheffield, "The way we currently

00:03:16.719 --> 00:03:21.129
maintain clean water supplies is a little
like using antibiotics without knowing what

00:03:21.129 --> 00:03:26.069
infection we're treating," it works, but just
like in our gut, we might be harming the good

00:03:26.069 --> 00:03:27.910
organisms along with the bad.

00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:32.610
We don't want to kill ALL bacteria in our
water, but as techniques improve, we can filter

00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:36.260
out the bad bacteria, and leave the biofilms
to help out.

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:43.940

off tap water?

00:04:00.889 --> 00:04:07.219
It SHOULDN'T…
