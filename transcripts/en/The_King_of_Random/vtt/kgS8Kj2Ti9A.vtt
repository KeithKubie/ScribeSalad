00:00:01.079 --> 00:00:02.610
Whoa wow wow wo woah

00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:05.989
Hey, what's up guys welcome back I'm grant Thompson. The king of random and for this video

00:00:05.990 --> 00:00:09.559
I have a little bit of a secret to share with you. I do not know how to fly a drone

00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:14.719
I've never touched one before I've never operated one before and even though I have a commercial airline pilots license

00:00:14.719 --> 00:00:18.889
I've never actually had the opportunity to play with cool technology like this so for this video

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:20.570
I reached out to a company called DJI

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:21.530
I'm sure you've heard of them

00:00:21.530 --> 00:00:25.969
And I had them send me some of their newest products so the purpose of this video today is to share my personal experience from

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:31.369
The unboxing of a product, I've never touched before to becoming a confident and competent DJI drone pilot

00:00:31.369 --> 00:00:35.449
Let's take a look at what we got I got three products from DJI I get their spark

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:36.590
I got the Mavic Pro

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:37.650
and I also got the

00:00:37.650 --> 00:00:39.650
fpv goggles first person view

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:43.790
Now the idea behind all these the spark is one of the smallest drones is supposed to be extremely user friendly

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:46.250
Right out of the box almost anybody can use it

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:51.680
We'll see if that's the case the Mavic pro is a very cool piece of equipment my film guy mark has one and flies it

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:53.040
Around and makes it look very easy

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:56.269
so I'm going to see how I do trying it out for the first time and the

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:01.370
Fpv goggles well it seemed like a pretty cool concept as well you put them on and as you fly the drone you can see

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:07.609
What the drone sees apparently when you move your head the camera moves in whichever direction you look the camera also follows

00:01:07.609 --> 00:01:10.909
So that's gonna. Be pretty cool to explore this video is not sponsored by DJ

00:01:10.909 --> 00:01:15.498
I actually wanted to take it on as a project because as crazy as it may sound I'm a little bit hesitant of

00:01:15.959 --> 00:01:21.559
Actually flying a drone never done it before I'm not familiar with it so this video is me crossing that boundary to becoming a confident

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:23.539
and proficient DJI drone pilot

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:26.989
And I will leave affiliate links down in the description in case you want to check out some of these products yourself

00:01:27.719 --> 00:01:30.619
Alright, so we've just stepped inside from it so we can unbox these things

00:01:30.619 --> 00:01:34.758
You will literally be seeing these for the first time as I do. Let's start with the spark

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:41.089
Looks like a carrying case that's pretty cool. Oh

00:01:42.929 --> 00:01:49.369
Wow that's the spark oh my gosh, that is so small that is really tiny I mean if I stretch my hand out

00:01:49.369 --> 00:01:51.369
They're almost the same size

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:06.250
Better like in every language of possible cool, so I just got everything out of the box

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:09.250
And here's what we've got a super tiny drone the DJI Sparkle

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:13.239
It looks cool came with a controller that unfolds it also compacts together very tightly

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:15.940
Takes a very minimal space I also got an extra battery

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:18.340
battery charger and a few cables and cords

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:23.229
Now in addition to that I got a few of these little bumper guards that I imagine go on the edges to protect the propellers

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:28.840
From bumping into anything inside the house making it just a little more user friendly. I'm gonna see exactly how difficult

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:32.890
It is to put these little bumpers on looking at it for the first time I can see there's little clasps here

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:34.890
and if I undo those clasps

00:02:36.319 --> 00:02:38.319
Yep clicks into place and then

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:40.579
Boom, that's on

00:02:40.579 --> 00:02:42.110
Put this back

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:47.709
I'm just gonna push that down twist it to the right and that is installed that was actually pretty easy even for me

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:53.409
There we go boom bumper guards are installed my DJ. Spark is assembled and ready to go

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:54.849
It just needs the battery to be charged

00:02:54.849 --> 00:02:58.029
So we're gonna go ahead and assemble the battery charger throw the batteries on to get them

00:02:58.099 --> 00:02:59.590
Ramping up and while we're waiting for those

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:03.039
Let's go ahead and take a look at the Mavic Pro the Maverick Pro has a 4k

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:04.130
camera and a

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:09.909
3-axis gimbal which gives it a lot of dexterity as its flying around and keeps your shots very stable if you've watched any other reviews

00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:13.719
On the Maverick Pro you already know that it's very compact. It works really well flies very well

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:18.699
It's got an amazing battery life. It lasts up to 27 minutes per flight. It's incredible. It's very lightweight

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:23.500
It's very compact and it folds up to take up hardly any space at all and that's it boom

00:03:23.799 --> 00:03:26.559
Flying 4k camera for the win. It's kind of cool

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:28.780
Looks like a little bug doesn't it like all folds up

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:34.840
Another cool feature is you can actually remove the plastic guard on the front and just let the camera fly by itself with nothing

00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:39.339
affecting the quality of the image or you can just leave it on for safety and protection

00:03:40.579 --> 00:03:41.690
Totally up to you

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:46.660
We got the batteries for the spark and the Mavic charging so our waiting. We're gonna look at the DJI goggles next

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:49.480
They just got the Box open the first thing

00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:51.519
I notice is this nice white headset here

00:03:51.889 --> 00:03:57.069
DJI on the front and it's got a little latch on the top, which is obviously a release mechanism for whatever connects in there

00:03:57.069 --> 00:03:59.379
So let's take a little bit deeper into the box and see what else we find

00:04:03.130 --> 00:04:06.900
Try to figure this thing out I found like a little halo band that obviously sits on top of your head

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:11.999
It's got something sticking out the top here. We take the goggles it looks like they will click right into place. Oh

00:04:12.820 --> 00:04:15.180
There we go I just heard a click. That's what we need right there

00:04:15.910 --> 00:04:17.910
Perfect those are on and locked

00:04:18.010 --> 00:04:22.349
Now we got this nice little headset. That's going to go on and play with in a bit, but first

00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:24.350
I want to see what else is in the box

00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:36.570
Now that we got all this stuff out and batteries charging it's time to read the instructions so here. We are guys

00:04:36.570 --> 00:04:37.710
It's actually the next day

00:04:37.710 --> 00:04:42.690
And I do want to say with all three of these devices going through them for the first time it did take me about four

00:04:42.690 --> 00:04:43.980
hours to get everything set up

00:04:43.980 --> 00:04:48.689
so
I'm just gonna run you through the basics of how to set these things up and get them operational if you want a more detailed

00:04:48.690 --> 00:04:53.730
Information I found there are hundreds of videos on YouTube that walk you step-by-step through the actual process itself

00:04:53.730 --> 00:04:56.069
So here's what I did I start off with the DJI spark

00:04:56.070 --> 00:04:59.459
And I downloaded an app called DJI go for and once it was installed

00:04:59.460 --> 00:05:04.620
It basically just walked me through the process on how to connect this thing once the battery is installed on the spark all you have

00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:09.390
To do is press the button once and then hold it a second time and the machine will actually turn on and then if you

00:05:09.390 --> 00:05:14.009
Hold the button down for about six seconds you hear a beep once and then it beeps a second time and starts transmitting

00:05:14.140 --> 00:05:15.900
Wi-Fi which you can pick up on your phone

00:05:15.900 --> 00:05:18.810
I connected to the Wi-Fi so I can do all the firmware updates

00:05:18.810 --> 00:05:24.540
I connected the controller and did the same thing and then I paired the controller to the drone using a simple tutorial I found in

00:05:24.540 --> 00:05:29.069
YouTube for the spark and of course to shut these things down you just press the button once and then hold it a second time

00:05:29.070 --> 00:05:30.610
And it will power down

00:05:30.610 --> 00:05:35.460
Now as someone who's never seen this before I never played with the drone before it took me about an hour and a half to

00:05:35.460 --> 00:05:37.460
Get all the firmware updated everything connected correctly

00:05:37.630 --> 00:05:42.929
It was a pretty slow process mainly because I had to stumble through it so I would budget an hour and a half to two

00:05:42.930 --> 00:05:46.770
Hours to get this thing fully set up and be aware of the space around you when you're operating it

00:05:46.770 --> 00:05:48.750
You can use your phone as a controller

00:05:48.750 --> 00:05:52.020
But I wasn't sure how to do that and I actually drove this up into the ceiling

00:05:52.210 --> 00:05:57.150
Or it just bumped around for a little while and that's why you can see all the white weight on the blades here, although

00:05:57.150 --> 00:05:58.140
It's still durable enough

00:05:58.140 --> 00:06:00.030
I could still fly it without any problem at all

00:06:00.030 --> 00:06:04.320
So don't do as I do don't press buttons you're not familiar with yet, or you may end up digging your blades

00:06:04.420 --> 00:06:06.809
So that's the spark let's talk about the Mavic Pro

00:06:07.120 --> 00:06:12.090
This thing's pretty much the same works on the go for app as well and once you download and install all the firmware and get

00:06:12.090 --> 00:06:12.870
everything synced up

00:06:12.870 --> 00:06:15.700
It's pretty much as easy as plugging your phone into this little USB

00:06:15.830 --> 00:06:19.479
Connecter once you put that in with the app everything gets recognized it syncs to the drone

00:06:19.480 --> 00:06:21.820
And you can start flying which is very cool finally

00:06:21.820 --> 00:06:25.329
We have the DJI goggles these screens are in 1920 by 1080 resolution

00:06:25.460 --> 00:06:28.539
Which gives you a really clear crisp image as you're flying

00:06:28.580 --> 00:06:30.970
There's a little flap on the underside here that you can plug your USB

00:06:31.220 --> 00:06:37.539
Connector into and I actually hook this up to my computer and downloaded some software from DJI to get these things synchronized once

00:06:37.540 --> 00:06:39.700
They're turned on they seem to sink right to the Mavic Pro

00:06:39.700 --> 00:06:42.729
I didn't have any problems with that and the coolest thing about using these is it gives you a

00:06:42.920 --> 00:06:48.400
First-person point of view from the drones camera so you can actually see what it sees as you're flying

00:06:48.400 --> 00:06:52.479
It's amazing when you put these goggles on there's a touchpad right on the side here

00:06:52.480 --> 00:06:57.069
You can use to scroll around if you swipe down you can access the settings menu by hitting it once when you go into settings

00:06:57.070 --> 00:07:01.960
You can scroll down to linked settings and then you can quick link to the Maverick Pro

00:07:01.960 --> 00:07:03.850
It gives us 60 seconds to link up the drone

00:07:03.850 --> 00:07:06.129
Oh if we flip this over and open this little flap on the back

00:07:06.200 --> 00:07:10.360
You can see there's a little button in the top left hand corner if we take something sharp

00:07:11.120 --> 00:07:15.549
Scissors are probably not recommended, but with we press that in it should make the connection

00:07:16.730 --> 00:07:18.290
Lincoln complete

00:07:18.290 --> 00:07:21.850
So this point everything is linked up and ready to go we have our goggles connected to the Maverick Pro

00:07:21.850 --> 00:07:24.489
They can also be connected to the spark if you use a little

00:07:24.590 --> 00:07:31.540
USB adapter to the remote control itself and the spark can be flown with the remote your phone or by hand like Jedi Mind Tricks

00:07:31.540 --> 00:07:32.950
It's cool, and I'll show you that in a second

00:07:32.950 --> 00:07:36.610
I got a Samsung Galaxy s8 and it fits nicely into the remote for the Mavic pro

00:07:36.610 --> 00:07:38.830
I just had to take the casing off because that was a little bit too bulky

00:07:38.900 --> 00:07:42.400
But that's a good fit and our headset is now connected as well so we can get that

00:07:42.650 --> 00:07:46.150
First-person point of view and see exactly what the drone is seeing as we fly it around

00:07:46.460 --> 00:07:51.250
Another impressive feature is the map that can fly four point three miles line-of-sight, which is really impressive distance

00:07:51.250 --> 00:07:54.429
So now that we got everything set up and ready to go. Let's take them outside and play

00:09:05.100 --> 00:09:09.200
First flight a success from here back in one piece that was actually a really cool view

00:09:09.200 --> 00:09:13.700
I went up lift around the neighborhood a little bit saw us on the mountains off in the distance and it felt like I was

00:09:13.700 --> 00:09:19.129
Actually there it almost feels like playing on Google Maps where you get to scroll out and just kind of zoom around except apparently

00:09:19.130 --> 00:09:20.279
It's happening in real life

00:09:20.279 --> 00:09:21.630
That was a trip

00:09:21.630 --> 00:09:26.359
Now the cool thing about the spark is you don't actually need a controller or a phone to actually operate it

00:09:26.360 --> 00:09:30.229
You can just get the system going until it powers up, and then you're gonna click the button twice point at your face

00:09:30.230 --> 00:09:33.050
And it'll take off flying on its own and respond to hand gestures

00:09:33.899 --> 00:09:35.760
as free

00:09:35.760 --> 00:09:39.649
At this point all we have to do is stick out our hand the front lights will turn green

00:09:39.690 --> 00:09:41.690
We can guide it like a Jedi

00:09:42.390 --> 00:09:48.439
If I move my hand down it goes down. I move my hand back up it goes up and to the side

00:09:59.730 --> 00:10:03.020
Now here's another feature. I think is pretty cool. If you wave your hand that it's saying goodbye

00:10:03.089 --> 00:10:05.719
It'll actually back up to where you can take a selfie watch this

00:10:36.580 --> 00:10:40.980
So, this is a pretty cool machine even without a remote control you can fly it using your hand which I think is awesome and

00:10:40.980 --> 00:10:46.139
If you want to land it you just simply stick your hand underneath the spark and it auto lands right under your hand just make

00:10:46.140 --> 00:10:49.170
Sure your fingers are straight, so you don't get them stuck up into the blade area

00:11:06.640 --> 00:11:09.330
So there you have it guys the DJI sparked the Mavic pro

00:11:09.330 --> 00:11:13.949
And the DJI goggles very very cool equipment that I knew absolutely nothing about going into this video

00:11:13.950 --> 00:11:18.330
And now I feel relatively confident and very excited to fly these in the future in fact

00:11:18.330 --> 00:11:20.130
I think I might have been bit with that drone flying

00:11:20.130 --> 00:11:22.530
Bug if you know what I'm saying so now I've got my drones

00:11:22.530 --> 00:11:24.839
And you can - I put the affiliate links down in the description

00:11:25.180 --> 00:11:29.549
That should take you straight to DJI so they can get you hooked up. Thanks for joining me for this video fly boys

00:11:29.550 --> 00:11:31.550
I'll see you in the next one talk to you then

00:11:45.300 --> 00:11:48.269
I don't think it stopped and I make it stop

00:11:51.190 --> 00:11:55.690
Cut the battery our disconnection works every time

00:12:10.750 --> 00:12:13.230
Wow goes right back to that position, that's crazy

00:12:18.350 --> 00:12:20.650
It looks like it's going down the pool
