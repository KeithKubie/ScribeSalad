00:00:04.339 --> 00:00:07.819
 Whether you are waiting for the exam, or you will start an important presentation, or you are in 

00:00:07.819 --> 00:00:12.350
 Starting a race, we all experienced nervousness / anxiety. But why are we nervous? Is surveillance 

00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:16.510
 Professional athletes help us understand how to deal effectively with it? 

00:00:16.510 --> 00:00:20.109
 In difficult situations, the brain sends a signal from the pituitary gland 

00:00:20.109 --> 00:00:24.980
 The way to the kidneys where the adrenal gland is located. This is where adrenaline is released. 

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:28.940
 It has been felt before - the speed of the heartbeat, the dilated pupil and increased circulation 

00:00:28.940 --> 00:00:33.039
 In your muscles. This is all part of the response to the "war or flight" that has grown in 

00:00:33.039 --> 00:00:37.480
 Our evolutionary history to help us survive. But this response is not all or nothing - there 

00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:41.470
 Degrees of reaction, according to the perceived threat or significance of the result 

00:00:41.470 --> 00:00:46.040
 View. So something like an interview, which is challenging, motivates 

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:50.890
 The biological reaction itself is a threat to your life - but to a lesser degree. 

00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:54.710
 Feel those "moving butterflies" in your stomach? This is because adrenaline helps to reorient 

00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:58.739
 Blood and energy to the most important parts of your body during stress, such as the heart 

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:02.809
 Muscle, and away from the digestive system causing the closure of the blood vessels 

00:01:02.809 --> 00:01:05.549
 Around your stomach and cause you to feel these pokes. 

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:09.009
 So, how do professional athletes deal with stress and nerves? 

00:01:09.009 --> 00:01:13.959
 The concept of "mental images" is a widely used method in famous sports 

00:01:13.959 --> 00:01:18.289
 Defined cognitive, "athletes simply imagine themselves practicing technique or skill 

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:22.689
 Before competition or training. Although this seems crazy, it actually stimulates 

00:01:22.689 --> 00:01:27.729
 Brain related neurons in the brain, showing that they have a role in promoting specific skill. 

00:01:27.729 --> 00:01:31.380
 "Specific motivational images" on the other hand encourage athletes to remember a feeling 

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:36.549
 Winning an event or overcoming a competitor as a motivational tool. Finally, "Mastery 

00:01:36.549 --> 00:01:42.209
 General motivation "skill that is commonly used by athletes to feel more confident. Again, simply by imagining 

00:01:42.209 --> 00:01:47.039
 Concentrate themselves as strong and with positive feelings and thoughts before the competition, become athletes 

00:01:47.039 --> 00:01:52.200
 Able to improve performance and overcome nerves. Trust, in particular, is a constant factor of 

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:56.869
 The factors that distinguish successful athletes from others, and receive great attention from 

00:01:56.869 --> 00:01:57.380
 Professional Trainers. 

00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:01.300
 So, the next time you feel those nerves roll inside you, try to prepare as an Olympic champion Lucent! What 

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:06.100
 Are you waiting? Stand on your mark, get ready, go! 

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:08.100
 Do not forget: we have a new video every day during the Olympics.
