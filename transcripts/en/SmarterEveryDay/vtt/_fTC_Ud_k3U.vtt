00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.280
Hey it's me Destin, welcome back to Smarter Every Day.

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:03.560
There's only few times in your

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:04.859
life when you look at something and

00:00:04.860 --> 00:00:08.000
you're like: 'You know, this can't be a thing,'

00:00:08.380 --> 00:00:09.540
But it is a thing!

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:11.639
This video is just like that. We're going

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:13.440
to look at an invention today by Nikola

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:15.480
Tesla, but the thing is, it looks just

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:17.850
like a video game, but I assure you this

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:20.520
video is real. Before we check that out I

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:21.359
want to go look at a couple of

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:23.160
contributions he made to society as

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:24.869
soon as he emigrated to the U.S. in the

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:26.640
1880s. If you've ever done a

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:28.619
patent search on Nikola Tesla you'll be

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:31.590
amazed. It's all there! Pumps, guidance,

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:33.660
power distribution, fluid propulsion,

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:35.760
wireless energy, and a super important

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:38.820
one: motors. Tesla created a multi-phase

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:40.800
AC generator system that first proved it

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:42.360
could work at the Ames Hydroelectric

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:45.030
Power Plant in Colorado. This led to Tesla

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:46.680
teaming up with George Westinghouse and

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:48.780
creating the first large-scale AC power

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:51.059
plant at Niagara Falls, which was a huge

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:53.280
deal. If you haven't seen, it this really

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:54.989
cool statue of Tesla overlooks the

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:57.120
Canadian side of Niagara Falls. My

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:58.530
favorite part of the statue tells how

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:00.690
it came up with the idea of AC power.

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:02.129
He said he was walking in a park in

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:04.019
Budapest with a friend when suddenly the

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:06.390
idea of rotating magnetic fields

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:08.520
came to him like lightning so, he drew it in the dust.

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:10.760
Speaking of lightning, Tesla carried out

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:12.420
incredible experiments with high voltage

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:15.299
arcs in Colorado Springs. One such

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:17.400
experiment involved making this circuit.

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:19.259
There's a power supply which charges a

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:21.150
capacitor and when the capacitor fills

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:22.979
up in arcs across a spark gap, which

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:26.159
dumps that energy into a primary coil.

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:27.990
A secondary coil is tuned to the same

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:30.030
frequency for resonance, and then boosts

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:32.420
that voltage, and there you have it. Lightning.

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:34.460
There's a company called One Tesla

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:35.720
that makes do-it-yourself

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:37.909
Tesla coils that you can buy and assemble

00:01:37.909 --> 00:01:39.749
all by yourself as long as you know how to solder.

00:01:39.749 --> 00:01:41.360
My buddy Philip works at a

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:42.570
nuclear plant, so since we're dealing

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:43.979
with high-voltage, I got him to come over

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:45.659
and help me out. These things are super

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:47.340
cool and a great place to start if you

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:49.140
want to build your own coil. Instead of

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:51.119
using a spark gap like Tesla did, this

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:52.860
thing uses a really fancy inhibitor

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:54.450
circuit that lets you do really cool

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:56.490
stuff. You can load MIDI files onto an

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:58.079
onboard SD card and it will play

00:01:58.079 --> 00:01:59.490
whatever song you want.

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:02.670
I wanted to hear it play O Fortuna

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:13.640
(buzzing in the tune of 'O Fortuna') Whoa!

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:16.300
(astonished noise)

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:21.200
Obviously, the next step was to try to impress the kids.

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:23.700
(buzzing to the tune of 'Super Mario Bros. - Main Theme')

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:24.440
(laughter)

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:28.840
(tune continues)

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:31.160
That is so cool

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:38.040
(tune continues)

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:40.240
(laughter)

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:43.220
after this we started trying to

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:44.860
methodically probe the limits of the

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:46.730
system to see what it was really capable of,

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:48.470
but I got a little too confident, and in my

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:50.030
excitement I started to do things with

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:52.040
the manual tells you not to do.

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:53.840
Looking back at it this is kind of funny,

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:55.610
because you can see the exact second

00:02:55.610 --> 00:03:01.340
when i go from pure geek joy, to instant regret.

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:04.500
(rapid, high pitched buzzing)

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:05.600
Are you seein' this?

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:07.760
Oh it broke!

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:09.520
I broke it and I feel bad about that,

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:11.120
because I knew what I was doing, I over

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:12.980
drove it I probably broke the rectifier

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:15.800
or the igbt and I'm sad. It's a DIY

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:17.930
coil, though. We can fix it quickly, but

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:19.010
instead of working on it why don't we go

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:20.420
visit a guy in my hometown, who has a

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:23.150
website dedicated to Tesla coils. I

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:25.430
found him today, have never met the dude,

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:27.380
about to go be best friends with this

00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:29.090
guy. he's got a little bit larger coil.

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:30.920
Let's go get Smarter Every Day.

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:33.080
This is Cameron Prince. He runs the number one

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:34.550
Tesla resource website on the

00:03:34.550 --> 00:03:37.430
Internet called teslauniverse.com. He

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:39.290
provides tesla coil performances, and he

00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:41.000
also happens to live directly across the

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:43.010
street from my aunt and uncle.

00:03:43.010 --> 00:03:44.300
This is a little bit bigger than mine.

00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:49.550
"How big is this thing?" Prince: "Oh it stands about nine foot-tall." Destin: "Nine foot-tall? "Did you build it?"

00:03:49.550 --> 00:03:52.370
Prince: "I did. It's as big as I could make

00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:53.870
it and fit in the garage."

00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:55.640
"Really." "Yeah." "So that was the design requirement?"

00:03:55.640 --> 00:03:57.830
"Yeah that was the design limitation there."

00:03:57.830 --> 00:03:59.720
Destin: "Is that a capacitor bank down there?"

00:03:59.720 --> 00:04:01.910
Prince: "Yeah, that's a big capacitor bank."

00:04:01.910 --> 00:04:03.080
"Dude! That's not a joke!"

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:05.780
Prince: "Those came out of an MRI machine."

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:07.670
"Really. Is that the most expensive part of the

00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:11.450
whole device?" Uhm probably." "And do the cats walk

00:04:11.450 --> 00:04:13.490
around when you're doing it?"

00:04:13.490 --> 00:04:16.290
Destin: "That would- It would bake a cat, man!"

00:04:16.580 --> 00:04:18.280
Destin, narrating: Cameron is the real deal. When I was a

00:04:18.290 --> 00:04:19.880
kid I collected baseball cards and rode

00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:22.070
my bike. Not Cameron. His life changed

00:04:22.070 --> 00:04:24.020
forever the first time he saw a picture

00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:26.510
of Nikola Tesla." Cameron: "when I saw those pictures

00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:28.490
of him in colorado springs, in his

00:04:28.490 --> 00:04:31.580
experiments, sittin' in front of his coil,

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:32.710
that lightning going around him

00:04:32.710 --> 00:04:34.570
and then I was hooked. You know most people were...

00:04:34.570 --> 00:04:36.670
when they were kids, were throwing baseballs

00:04:36.670 --> 00:04:39.180
and stuff. I had a box of light bulbs and wires and

00:04:39.190 --> 00:04:41.740
batteries" Destin: "That's awesome. I like

00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:43.030
it when people are excited about things.

00:04:43.030 --> 00:04:44.890
This makes it so much more fun."

00:04:44.890 --> 00:04:47.130
okay here we go

00:04:47.130 --> 00:04:49.690
(indistinct speech, snapping switches)

00:04:49.690 --> 00:04:52.650
(loud buzzing, rising in intensity)

00:04:52.650 --> 00:04:54.490
Destin: "Holy Cow!"

00:04:54.490 --> 00:05:00.330
(buzzing continues)

00:05:00.340 --> 00:05:02.340
'Ok, I got it! I got it!"

00:05:02.340 --> 00:05:06.220
(buzzing falls off, Destin laughs) "That is ridiculous!

00:05:06.220 --> 00:05:09.180
(still laughing) Alright. Alright. That's unnerving!

00:05:09.200 --> 00:05:11.440
Time out. There are some experiences you

00:05:11.440 --> 00:05:13.750
cannot convey via internet video, and

00:05:13.750 --> 00:05:14.860
this is one of those. We're talking

00:05:14.860 --> 00:05:16.990
20-foot lightning bolts hitting the

00:05:16.990 --> 00:05:19.270
ground constantly in front of you.

00:05:19.270 --> 00:05:21.220
This was unreal. My heart has never gone from

00:05:21.220 --> 00:05:23.710
zero to a hundred in this short amount

00:05:23.710 --> 00:05:26.910
of time. It was... whatever. I can't explain it,

00:05:26.919 --> 00:05:30.430
I'm not gonna try." "I can't explain that!"

00:05:30.430 --> 00:05:32.470
After I calmed down a bit, Cameron asked me if

00:05:32.470 --> 00:05:35.110
I wanted to see a real-life Tesla gun,

00:05:35.110 --> 00:05:36.910
which I didn't even know was a thing!

00:05:36.910 --> 00:05:38.440
He built this thing from a kit designed by

00:05:38.440 --> 00:05:40.270
his two friends Steve Ward and Phillip

00:05:40.270 --> 00:05:42.340
Slowinski. Only a few of these things exist

00:05:42.340 --> 00:05:43.810
in the world, and I apologize for the

00:05:43.810 --> 00:05:45.940
laughing here, but I was really, really

00:05:45.940 --> 00:05:46.840
excited.

00:05:46.840 --> 00:05:48.550
It doesn't look real; it feels like

00:05:48.550 --> 00:05:50.800
you're in some kind of video game.

00:05:50.800 --> 00:05:53.320
"How do you control the power output?"

00:05:53.320 --> 00:05:55.210
"The display right here." "Dude! This is full-on

00:05:55.210 --> 00:05:57.840
Ghostbusters stuff" "Oh yeah. Totally." "Where do I need

00:05:57.850 --> 00:06:00.220
to stand?" "Uh, anywhere. I need help with a breaker,

00:06:00.220 --> 00:06:02.380
that pin there, pull up."

00:06:02.400 --> 00:06:07.749
(pin clicks) Destin: "Holy Moly! Okay." "Alright."

00:06:09.520 --> 00:06:15.520
(Destin laughs)

00:06:15.520 --> 00:06:18.480
Destin: "Where do I need to stand?" "Anywhere." "Oh, dude."

00:06:19.760 --> 00:06:21.360
(Tesla coil buzzes)

00:06:21.360 --> 00:06:22.720
"Wow."

00:06:22.720 --> 00:06:26.320
(continued buzzing) Cameron: "That's super low,"

00:06:26.320 --> 00:06:28.160
(buzzing stops) "but I can bring the intensity up."

00:06:28.160 --> 00:06:29.760
Destin: "You know that that feeling when"

00:06:29.779 --> 00:06:31.699
somebody has a loaded gun around you,

00:06:31.699 --> 00:06:34.849
only the gun could point anywhere.

00:06:34.849 --> 00:06:37.069
So I'm going to step back here. (laughs)

00:06:37.069 --> 00:06:40.269
(deeper buzzing)

00:06:40.269 --> 00:06:43.249
"Wow. So what's it arcing to? Why is it not

00:06:43.249 --> 00:06:45.229
coming back to ground?

00:06:45.229 --> 00:06:46.969
So, that's the primary coil.

00:06:46.969 --> 00:06:49.309
No you do not have air-cooling on that!"

00:06:49.309 --> 00:06:51.229
Cameron: "It's water cooled."  "It's water cooled?!"

00:06:51.229 --> 00:06:54.469
Destin: "You know what's unreal to me? I wanted to study Tesla coils, and I

00:06:54.469 --> 00:06:57.169
started googling, and you live where I live."

00:06:57.169 --> 00:07:01.580
"Yeah." "That's unreal." "It is." (Destin laughs) "Oh dude.

00:07:01.580 --> 00:07:05.900
"One more time please." (buzzing and maniacal laughter)

00:07:05.920 --> 00:07:07.969
ok ok, Let's get ready to do the

00:07:07.969 --> 00:07:09.439
high-speed. let's do high speed."

00:07:09.439 --> 00:07:11.059
(narrating) "After capturing several videos with the

00:07:11.059 --> 00:07:12.409
Phantom, I decided I didn't like the

00:07:12.409 --> 00:07:13.999
lighting. The problem was it was too dark

00:07:13.999 --> 00:07:15.589
to see the gun, but I needed the darkness

00:07:15.589 --> 00:07:17.539
to be able to see the arc. Cameron agreed

00:07:17.539 --> 00:07:18.680
to bring the gun over my house the

00:07:18.680 --> 00:07:20.689
following day at sundown, so that I could

00:07:20.689 --> 00:07:22.610
use the sunlight to illuminate the gun,

00:07:22.610 --> 00:07:24.800
and I used a black backdrop so I could

00:07:24.800 --> 00:07:26.509
record the lightning bolt coming out of it

00:07:26.509 --> 00:07:29.709
at 28,000 frames per second.

00:07:29.709 --> 00:07:32.000
(buzzing)

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:34.560
Destin: "Got it. Got it!"

00:07:34.560 --> 00:07:36.160
(whooshing background noise)

00:07:36.160 --> 00:07:41.280
(crackling noise echoing)

00:07:41.280 --> 00:07:43.200
(sudden buzzing)

00:07:43.200 --> 00:07:50.000
(crackling continues)

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:52.000
(noises fade)

00:07:55.200 --> 00:07:56.640
(sudden buzzing)

00:07:56.640 --> 00:08:00.720
(echoed crackling)

00:08:00.720 --> 00:08:05.110
(buzzing and continued crackling)

00:08:05.110 --> 00:08:07.510
Ok. After watching this slow-mo, and seeing

00:08:07.510 --> 00:08:10.030
that arc curve back towards Cameron, the

00:08:10.030 --> 00:08:11.980
obvious next question to ask is: what

00:08:11.980 --> 00:08:13.750
happens if you get hit?" "He's just

00:08:13.750 --> 00:08:15.270
casually cleaning his Tesla coil."

00:08:16.960 --> 00:08:18.000
(buzzing)

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:19.440
"WHAT?!"

00:08:21.360 --> 00:08:23.200
"It's hittin' your hand!" (Cameron chuckles)

00:08:25.510 --> 00:08:32.150
Destin: "What? Can that go through your heart?" "I mean yeah, but it's so low current."

00:08:32.160 --> 00:08:35.760
The primary coil on a Tesla coil circuit? Fatal, no questions asked.

00:08:35.760 --> 00:08:37.180
But on the secondary coil the

00:08:37.180 --> 00:08:38.530
output is in microamps, which is

00:08:38.530 --> 00:08:40.180
generally accepted to be safe, but some

00:08:40.180 --> 00:08:41.600
people still say it's dangerous.

00:08:41.600 --> 00:08:42.580
Here's the deal.

00:08:42.580 --> 00:08:44.800
DO NOT do this. A lot of people say this

00:08:44.800 --> 00:08:46.600
is safe a lot of people say it's dangerous,

00:08:46.600 --> 00:08:49.360
I just really wanted to touch it.

00:08:49.360 --> 00:08:51.760
"Ok, ready, ready to trigger the high-speed?"

00:08:52.120 --> 00:08:53.760
"Ok, Oh God, I'm good, I'm good.

00:08:53.780 --> 00:08:55.140
it just scared me

00:08:55.960 --> 00:08:57.820
Okay, go ahead.

00:08:57.820 --> 00:09:00.900
Okay. Wow, okay. All right. Yeah, it's thing."

00:09:00.900 --> 00:09:11.400
(guitar music and crackling buzzing)

00:09:12.500 --> 00:09:14.540
"So after I took that hit, Cameron asked me

00:09:14.550 --> 00:09:16.320
if I wanted to shoot it myself. I don't know

00:09:16.320 --> 00:09:17.970
if that was a rite of passage or what,

00:09:17.980 --> 00:09:20.730
but, um, yes, I would like to throw

00:09:20.730 --> 00:09:22.650
lightning bolts from my fingertips!"

00:09:22.650 --> 00:09:25.920
"You turnin' my breaker on? Oh! good grief!

00:09:25.920 --> 00:09:27.390
This Is like a video game!"

00:09:27.390 --> 00:09:29.440
Destin: "I can't thank you enough for lettin' me do this.

00:09:29.440 --> 00:09:33.280
I mean, this is like... the little boy in me is just..."

00:09:34.800 --> 00:09:36.640
"Wow!"

00:09:41.380 --> 00:09:43.980
"Okay. I need to give you your gun back".

00:09:43.980 --> 00:09:46.350
I had so much fun making this video

00:09:46.350 --> 00:09:47.730
I mean I just wanted to learn about Tesla

00:09:47.730 --> 00:09:49.800
coils and, all this happened; I'm very

00:09:49.800 --> 00:09:51.840
excited about this video. Anyway if you

00:09:51.840 --> 00:09:53.040
enjoyed this video, and you want to

00:10:07.710 --> 00:10:09.060
download for free if you go to

00:10:09.060 --> 00:10:11.370
audible.com/smarter. I do this every day.

00:10:11.370 --> 00:10:12.840
I listen to audiobooks on my way back

00:10:12.840 --> 00:10:14.640
and forth to work. Special treat today,

00:10:14.640 --> 00:10:16.920
Mark Cipher is a guy that I talked to

00:10:16.920 --> 00:10:18.630
through Cameron; he's a Tesla

00:10:18.630 --> 00:10:20.100
historian. He wrote the definitive book

00:10:20.100 --> 00:10:21.510
on Tesla's life.

00:10:21.510 --> 00:10:23.160
It's called Wizard, the Life and Times of Nikola Tesla.

00:10:23.160 --> 00:10:25.140
When I told him I was going

00:10:25.140 --> 00:10:27.300
to talk about his book in this video, he

00:10:27.300 --> 00:10:29.670
got so excited he filmed a little clip for me.

00:10:30.270 --> 00:10:32.610
Hello, my name is Mark Cipher, and I'm the

00:10:32.610 --> 00:10:35.220
author of Wizard: the Life and Times of

00:10:35.220 --> 00:10:37.620
Nikola Tesla. When I first learned about

00:10:37.620 --> 00:10:40.710
Tesla, he was a very obscure figure, but

00:10:40.710 --> 00:10:42.660
now his name has resurfaced, and he has

00:10:42.660 --> 00:10:45.900
become kind of pop science icon.

00:10:45.900 --> 00:10:48.000
Find Wizard: The Life and Times of Nikola Tesla

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:51.600
