00:00:02.272 --> 00:00:03.480
FEMALE SPEAKER: Hi, everyone.

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:10.370
Welcome I'm so grateful that
I get to host to Adam today

00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:11.430
at Google.

00:00:11.430 --> 00:00:15.010
And I just wanted to give
a little bit of intro.

00:00:15.010 --> 00:00:19.530
Adam has over 20 years
of combined experience

00:00:19.530 --> 00:00:21.660
in informal education.

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:26.340
First, building successful
creative business ventures,

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:30.060
and then applying the same
entrepreneurial spirit

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:32.350
within the nonprofit sector.

00:00:32.350 --> 00:00:36.160
As the Director of Global
Studios at the Exploratorium,

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:40.590
Adam is responsible for
furthering the museum's mission

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:44.820
of transformative education
by building partnerships with

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:48.460
and then providing creative
services to institutions

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:50.010
around the world.

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:52.810
For five years prior
to his current role,

00:00:52.810 --> 00:00:55.330
Adam was the Director
of Exhibit Development

00:00:55.330 --> 00:00:57.140
at the Exploratorium.

00:00:57.140 --> 00:01:00.910
Prior to that, Adam was an
award winning toy inventor

00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:05.069
and founder of two successful
educational toy development

00:01:05.069 --> 00:01:07.190
and manufacturing companies.

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:11.120
Adam also moonlights as a
mechanical artist creating

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:14.010
large kinetic
contraptions that attempt

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:18.610
to capture the whimsy of
his earlier toy creations.

00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:23.200
Adam holds a BA from Brandeis
University with concentrations

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:25.840
in music and physics.

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:28.410
So welcome Adam to Google.

00:01:28.410 --> 00:01:32.760
[APPLAUSE]

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:34.710
ADAM TOBIN: So
thank you so much.

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:36.590
It's really good to be here.

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:38.630
As I was preparing
for this talk,

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:41.064
the first thought I
had is this is easy.

00:01:41.064 --> 00:01:43.230
I have so much to talk about
with the Exploratorium.

00:01:43.230 --> 00:01:45.122
I can't wait to get
up there and share.

00:01:45.122 --> 00:01:46.830
And then I got afraid,
because I realized

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:49.790
I have so much to share
and so much to talk about.

00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:52.560
There's no way I'm going to fit
this in in the time allotted.

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:54.150
And I kind of found
a happy medium.

00:01:54.150 --> 00:01:55.750
I realized, OK,
I'm going to find

00:01:55.750 --> 00:01:57.970
a focus for how we talk
about the Exploratorium

00:01:57.970 --> 00:02:00.000
and the breadth of our work.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.000
There are several members
of my team here today.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.360
So if they all jump up and
start waving their hands,

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:06.010
that means that I'm
taking too long.

00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:07.550
And I'll try and
find a way to start

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:11.960
moving through all the
material we have to share.

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:13.700
Before we talk about
the work that we

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:15.730
do all around the
world, I think it's

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:21.060
important to be grounded first
in what the Exploratorium is,

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:25.799
who we are, and a little
bit of our history.

00:02:25.799 --> 00:02:28.090
Many of you, particularly
those of you in the Bay Area,

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:30.270
will know the
Exploratorium and as

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:35.550
a place that has interactive
and hands-on exhibits.

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:37.350
That's just the
tip of the iceberg.

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:41.130
What many people don't know is,
indeed, the breadth and impact

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:44.960
of the Exploratorium as an
institution over a 45 year

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:45.920
history.

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:50.540
Some facts, we've created over
1,000 interactive exhibits.

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:54.180
They are used in 80%
of the science centers

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:55.750
all around the world.

00:02:55.750 --> 00:02:59.440
We estimate around 200
million visitors a year

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:01.160
are using these
exhibits and programs.

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:04.440
And that's probably a
conservative estimate.

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:07.930
We have a website that has
11 million hits per year

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:10.350
with 50,000 pages of content.

00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:13.570
We were named as one of the
most influential nonprofits, one

00:03:13.570 --> 00:03:15.730
of the 12 most
influential non-profits,

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:17.700
of the last half century.

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:22.540
So there is so much going on at
the Exploratorium that puts us

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:25.370
in a position to work with
the wider world in the way

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:26.670
that we do.

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:30.956
So starting with a
little bit of history,

00:03:30.956 --> 00:03:34.330
the Exploratorium
was founded in 1969

00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:37.470
by Frank Oppenheimer, a
brother of Robert Oppenheimer.

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:40.050
And they worked side by side
on the Manhattan Project.

00:03:40.050 --> 00:03:43.630
Frank was a lifelong educator
with a passion for education

00:03:43.630 --> 00:03:46.860
and had notions about
creating a way of learning

00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:51.230
that was hands-on,
interactive, learner-driven

00:03:51.230 --> 00:03:53.560
and felt there was a need
to transform education

00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:55.190
as we knew it.

00:03:55.190 --> 00:03:58.700
Before the Exploratorium, if you
were to go to a science center,

00:03:58.700 --> 00:04:00.480
it was largely artifact-based.

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:03.560
It was a place that you would
see the artifacts of science

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:04.720
or the history of science.

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:06.720
So the way we think of
science centers right now

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:09.240
is a place where you put
your hands on experiments

00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:12.050
and authentic phenomena
by and large didn't exist.

00:04:12.050 --> 00:04:14.440
And the Exploratorium
played a critical role

00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:18.339
in creating what we now know
as the informal science center

00:04:18.339 --> 00:04:19.019
movement.

00:04:19.019 --> 00:04:21.560
Our original home was at
the Palace of Fine Arts.

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:26.050
The famous story is in 1969, one
day they just opened the doors.

00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:30.690
People came in, and the
museum was declared open.

00:04:30.690 --> 00:04:33.770
About two years ago, we moved
to our new location, the San

00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:35.880
Francisco waterfront
on the Embarcadero.

00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:38.200
It was an incredibly
transformative time

00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:40.630
for the institution and
in many ways directly

00:04:40.630 --> 00:04:43.210
relates to the ways in
which we started interfacing

00:04:43.210 --> 00:04:44.540
with the wider world.

00:04:44.540 --> 00:04:45.990
We're more centrally located.

00:04:45.990 --> 00:04:48.670
We started thinking more
broadly about the way

00:04:48.670 --> 00:04:52.920
in which we partner with people,
the way in which we approach

00:04:52.920 --> 00:04:55.160
content, and even
the types of content

00:04:55.160 --> 00:04:57.250
sets that we are
able to explore,

00:04:57.250 --> 00:04:59.350
not to mention the fact
that is significantly more

00:04:59.350 --> 00:05:01.100
accessible for those
of you who know where

00:05:01.100 --> 00:05:02.400
the Palace of Fine Art is.

00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:04.360
It's out in the edge
of San Francisco

00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:05.624
by the Golden Gate Bridge.

00:05:05.624 --> 00:05:07.790
I strongly suspect that a
strong portion of visitors

00:05:07.790 --> 00:05:09.331
who tried to get to
the Exploratorium

00:05:09.331 --> 00:05:10.860
ended up on the
Golden Gate Bridge.

00:05:10.860 --> 00:05:12.627
And now, we're on
public transportation.

00:05:12.627 --> 00:05:14.960
We're more accessible to a
wider variety of communities,

00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:19.240
including the South
Bay and East Bay.

00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:22.090
What makes the Exploratorium so
special and one of the reasons

00:05:22.090 --> 00:05:24.395
it's had the impact it
has is its approach.

00:05:24.395 --> 00:05:26.770
And I'd actually like to take
a moment to talk about some

00:05:26.770 --> 00:05:29.160
of the core elements
of our approach.

00:05:29.160 --> 00:05:31.230
And the first and perhaps
the most important

00:05:31.230 --> 00:05:34.085
is that we have a deep
pedagogical underpinning that

00:05:34.085 --> 00:05:36.220
is about inquiry-based learning.

00:05:36.220 --> 00:05:38.960
And simply put, that means
that it's learner-driven.

00:05:38.960 --> 00:05:40.680
You form your own questions.

00:05:40.680 --> 00:05:42.080
You create your own experience.

00:05:42.080 --> 00:05:43.420
You create your own pathways.

00:05:43.420 --> 00:05:47.626
You create your own interest, as
opposed to somebody telling you

00:05:47.626 --> 00:05:49.250
this is the thing
that you're studying.

00:05:49.250 --> 00:05:51.291
This is the thing you're
supposed to be learning.

00:05:51.291 --> 00:05:53.539
These are the questions that
we expect you to answer.

00:05:53.539 --> 00:05:55.205
This is one of our
most famous exhibits.

00:05:55.205 --> 00:05:57.020
It's a turntable exhibit.

00:05:57.020 --> 00:05:59.620
And basically, it's a rotating
table with a bunch of objects

00:05:59.620 --> 00:06:02.620
that you place on it and spin
and observe what happens.

00:06:02.620 --> 00:06:03.620
There is no sign.

00:06:03.620 --> 00:06:06.440
There is no explicit content.

00:06:06.440 --> 00:06:08.830
And yet, it's about engagement.

00:06:08.830 --> 00:06:10.260
It's about play.

00:06:10.260 --> 00:06:14.170
It's about hands-on an
understanding of the universe.

00:06:14.170 --> 00:06:16.922
Should you choose, then,
to explore content,

00:06:16.922 --> 00:06:18.630
obviously there's an
awful lot of physics

00:06:18.630 --> 00:06:20.260
that's going on
below the surface,

00:06:20.260 --> 00:06:22.810
enough to keep a
classroom or even

00:06:22.810 --> 00:06:28.020
a university student occupied
should you go that direction.

00:06:28.020 --> 00:06:30.140
We believe in
authentic phenomena.

00:06:30.140 --> 00:06:32.230
So the exhibits on the
Exploratorium floor,

00:06:32.230 --> 00:06:33.180
they're not models.

00:06:33.180 --> 00:06:34.460
They're not simulations.

00:06:34.460 --> 00:06:35.780
They are the real phenomena.

00:06:35.780 --> 00:06:37.780
And that dates all the
way back to our founding,

00:06:37.780 --> 00:06:41.840
where exhibits started off as
props, as experiments that you

00:06:41.840 --> 00:06:43.430
actually get your hands on.

00:06:43.430 --> 00:06:47.250
And this is an exhibit called
water drop photography, where

00:06:47.250 --> 00:06:49.910
you can time how long it
takes for a water drop

00:06:49.910 --> 00:06:51.270
to fall into a cup of water.

00:06:51.270 --> 00:06:52.400
Then you take a picture.

00:06:52.400 --> 00:06:55.680
And you can time where the
water droplet is in its journey

00:06:55.680 --> 00:06:57.470
when you take the picture.

00:06:57.470 --> 00:06:59.150
There's also
unexpected phenomena.

00:06:59.150 --> 00:07:01.150
If you were to look inside
the droplet of water,

00:07:01.150 --> 00:07:02.190
you see the lens.

00:07:02.190 --> 00:07:04.220
And you see the
upside down image.

00:07:04.220 --> 00:07:07.290
Again, you start with play and
interactivity, not the lesson

00:07:07.290 --> 00:07:10.550
about optics and lenses.

00:07:10.550 --> 00:07:12.820
Art and science is
another fundamental part

00:07:12.820 --> 00:07:14.710
of the Exploratorium
core approach,

00:07:14.710 --> 00:07:18.870
that we believe that the
processes of discovery of art

00:07:18.870 --> 00:07:20.680
and science are very similar.

00:07:20.680 --> 00:07:23.060
And the beauty of
natural phenomena

00:07:23.060 --> 00:07:25.190
and an artistic approach
provides a rather

00:07:25.190 --> 00:07:28.650
profound toe-hold for learners.

00:07:28.650 --> 00:07:31.010
So this is a picture inside
the new Exploratorium.

00:07:31.010 --> 00:07:33.780
And the last fundamental
aspect I would touch on right

00:07:33.780 --> 00:07:39.610
now is that of accessibility and
the power of creative engines

00:07:39.610 --> 00:07:44.104
and a sense of perpetual,
constant prototyping.

00:07:44.104 --> 00:07:46.270
This is our shop, which is
very unusual for museums,

00:07:46.270 --> 00:07:48.310
is right next to our floor.

00:07:48.310 --> 00:07:52.540
There's only a short pony wall
in between visitors and machine

00:07:52.540 --> 00:07:53.367
shop tools.

00:07:53.367 --> 00:07:55.200
And that was how it was
in the old building.

00:07:55.200 --> 00:07:56.570
And that is how it is
in the new building.

00:07:56.570 --> 00:07:57.980
It didn't have to be that way.

00:07:57.980 --> 00:08:00.890
But we insisted that
it be so in large part

00:08:00.890 --> 00:08:03.250
to demonstrate the fact
that there is no magic.

00:08:03.250 --> 00:08:07.130
Here is where the Exploratorium
and is being created.

00:08:07.130 --> 00:08:09.410
And those who are creating
it have direct access

00:08:09.410 --> 00:08:12.270
to the floor and our constantly
testing out their ideas

00:08:12.270 --> 00:08:13.000
on our floor.

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:15.680
We don't presume to get an
exhibit right or an experience

00:08:15.680 --> 00:08:19.382
right until we have
prototyped it significantly.

00:08:19.382 --> 00:08:21.090
I'll quickly show a
few of our galleries.

00:08:21.090 --> 00:08:22.470
This is our central gallery.

00:08:22.470 --> 00:08:24.803
It's probably the most similar
to the old Exploratorium,

00:08:24.803 --> 00:08:28.050
where you'll find classic
exhibits on light, optics,

00:08:28.050 --> 00:08:30.130
perception, listening.

00:08:30.130 --> 00:08:33.650
And if you look, it's actually
a rather understated building.

00:08:33.650 --> 00:08:34.900
It's a beautiful building.

00:08:34.900 --> 00:08:37.770
But the focus is on the
exhibits and the experiences,

00:08:37.770 --> 00:08:41.047
not so much the design
and the space around it.

00:08:41.047 --> 00:08:42.630
The new building
also gave us a chance

00:08:42.630 --> 00:08:44.590
to explore new content
areas, including

00:08:44.590 --> 00:08:46.440
sociology as a content set.

00:08:46.440 --> 00:08:50.320
This is an exhibition on
the science of sharing.

00:08:50.320 --> 00:08:54.550
We have an east gallery
that's about biology

00:08:54.550 --> 00:08:57.060
and natural systems.

00:08:57.060 --> 00:08:59.270
And because of our new
location, if right now you

00:08:59.270 --> 00:09:01.470
were to zoom into this
picture and look to the west,

00:09:01.470 --> 00:09:03.220
you would see the
skyline of San Francisco.

00:09:03.220 --> 00:09:04.600
And if you were to
look to the east,

00:09:04.600 --> 00:09:06.891
you would see the bay and
all the natural surroundings.

00:09:06.891 --> 00:09:08.440
So we created an
observatory, which

00:09:08.440 --> 00:09:12.230
is a place where you can,
well, observe what's going on

00:09:12.230 --> 00:09:15.400
and try and make sense of what
a rather complex system is

00:09:15.400 --> 00:09:18.220
the intersections perhaps
of natural and human

00:09:18.220 --> 00:09:20.190
made phenomenon.

00:09:20.190 --> 00:09:22.340
We also have a large
outdoor campus.

00:09:22.340 --> 00:09:23.940
Outdoor exhibits
are not new to us.

00:09:23.940 --> 00:09:26.570
But to have space
on our own campus

00:09:26.570 --> 00:09:28.620
where we can be exploring
outdoor surroundings

00:09:28.620 --> 00:09:31.260
was a wonderful opportunity
of the new building.

00:09:31.260 --> 00:09:33.530
So we began creating
experiences outside.

00:09:33.530 --> 00:09:35.380
This is an anamorphic bench.

00:09:35.380 --> 00:09:38.200
Anamorphosis is the
way in which an image

00:09:38.200 --> 00:09:41.520
is adapted, mutated if you
looked in a curved surface.

00:09:41.520 --> 00:09:43.420
So we reversed it and
put the mutated image

00:09:43.420 --> 00:09:44.260
in the real world.

00:09:44.260 --> 00:09:48.110
And if you look on the cylinder,
you see a rectangular bench.

00:09:48.110 --> 00:09:49.860
We created a mobile
camera obscura.

00:09:49.860 --> 00:09:52.080
There are rickshaws going
up and down the Embarcadero

00:09:52.080 --> 00:09:53.370
in San Francisco.

00:09:53.370 --> 00:09:55.920
So again, authentic
phenomena, there's

00:09:55.920 --> 00:09:57.660
a periscope that
comes out the top.

00:09:57.660 --> 00:09:59.720
And this is indeed a
mobile camera obscura

00:09:59.720 --> 00:10:01.260
out on the Embarcadero.

00:10:01.260 --> 00:10:03.890
Now I've been talking
a lot about exhibits.

00:10:03.890 --> 00:10:05.600
But as I said
before, that is just

00:10:05.600 --> 00:10:09.200
part of what the Exploratorium
is, an important part.

00:10:09.200 --> 00:10:10.970
But we are also
learning designers.

00:10:10.970 --> 00:10:16.000
We also teach professional
educators all around the world.

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:17.860
We have trained
thousands of teachers

00:10:17.860 --> 00:10:20.070
in the fundaments of
inquiry-based learning.

00:10:20.070 --> 00:10:24.160
And we take the same
approach to exhibits,

00:10:24.160 --> 00:10:27.200
and we apply it
using found objects

00:10:27.200 --> 00:10:30.510
for classroom exercises.

00:10:30.510 --> 00:10:32.220
We're also a cultural center.

00:10:32.220 --> 00:10:35.260
So the Exploratorium benefits
from being in San Francisco

00:10:35.260 --> 00:10:35.840
immensely.

00:10:35.840 --> 00:10:38.040
In large part, it is
who we are, the fact

00:10:38.040 --> 00:10:39.290
that we were born here.

00:10:39.290 --> 00:10:43.100
This is an example of an after
dark event in the evenings.

00:10:43.100 --> 00:10:44.240
It's just adults.

00:10:44.240 --> 00:10:47.170
And it's scientists, and
lectures, and artists.

00:10:47.170 --> 00:10:49.419
And it's actually
quite an event.

00:10:49.419 --> 00:10:50.960
You can have as many
as 5,000, 6,000,

00:10:50.960 --> 00:10:52.590
7,000 people in an evening.

00:10:52.590 --> 00:10:53.825
It's all adults.

00:10:53.825 --> 00:10:55.700
And it's a much different
kind of experience.

00:10:55.700 --> 00:10:57.820
But it shows the
power of community

00:10:57.820 --> 00:11:02.930
and the type of convening
space the Exploratorium can be.

00:11:02.930 --> 00:11:05.234
We also try to be
fearless whenever we can.

00:11:05.234 --> 00:11:06.900
Some of you who have
been to Burning Man

00:11:06.900 --> 00:11:08.970
will recognize El
Pulpo Mecanico.

00:11:08.970 --> 00:11:12.770
This was actually its final
performance, if you will,

00:11:12.770 --> 00:11:14.980
and part of our on the
move from the Palace

00:11:14.980 --> 00:11:18.190
of Fine Arts to the piers.

00:11:18.190 --> 00:11:21.460
And this was a group
called the Obscura Digital

00:11:21.460 --> 00:11:26.360
at our opening that projected on
the facade of the Exploratorium

00:11:26.360 --> 00:11:30.305
these wonderful images in
a project called Emergence.

00:11:30.305 --> 00:11:33.310
And it was something you can
see up and down the Embarcadero.

00:11:33.310 --> 00:11:38.170
Now, I'm here to talk
about our global impact.

00:11:38.170 --> 00:11:40.460
All of this has
been San Francisco.

00:11:40.460 --> 00:11:43.110
So how do you take
this and apply it?

00:11:43.110 --> 00:11:45.397
How do you take this
and make it extensible

00:11:45.397 --> 00:11:46.480
for the rest of the world?

00:11:49.850 --> 00:11:51.964
This Exploratorium
has a long history

00:11:51.964 --> 00:11:53.880
of working with partners
all around the world.

00:11:53.880 --> 00:11:55.505
And it started out
by and large with us

00:11:55.505 --> 00:11:57.730
reproducing our exhibits
that we were so famous for.

00:11:57.730 --> 00:12:00.530
In 1985, IBM approached
the Exploratorium

00:12:00.530 --> 00:12:03.300
about reproducing our exhibits
for a new gallery that

00:12:03.300 --> 00:12:04.309
was opening in New York.

00:12:04.309 --> 00:12:05.600
It's not something we had done.

00:12:05.600 --> 00:12:06.880
It's not something
we thought about.

00:12:06.880 --> 00:12:08.630
And we said, of
course, we'll do that.

00:12:08.630 --> 00:12:11.440
And that was the
beginning, the genesis,

00:12:11.440 --> 00:12:13.810
of a way in which
not only were we

00:12:13.810 --> 00:12:16.240
an inspiration to
institutions around the world

00:12:16.240 --> 00:12:18.260
and copied by institutions
around the world,

00:12:18.260 --> 00:12:20.340
we started formalizing
partnerships with them.

00:12:20.340 --> 00:12:22.830
That is the genesis of what
has become Global Studios.

00:12:22.830 --> 00:12:24.151
Global Studios is a new name.

00:12:24.151 --> 00:12:25.650
It's an outgrowth
of that work we've

00:12:25.650 --> 00:12:28.650
done over the years in exhibit
fabrication and replication.

00:12:28.650 --> 00:12:32.190
And there are a few
key aspects that

00:12:32.190 --> 00:12:36.110
make our relationship successful
and have allowed us to grow.

00:12:36.110 --> 00:12:37.690
The first is we'd
like to be as far

00:12:37.690 --> 00:12:40.210
upstream in the creative
process as possible.

00:12:40.210 --> 00:12:42.260
We don't like to just
reproduce what we've done.

00:12:42.260 --> 00:12:46.020
We like to have an understanding
of the unique and individual

00:12:46.020 --> 00:12:49.140
needs and circumstances of
anybody that we work with.

00:12:49.140 --> 00:12:51.580
We like to bring our
intellectual capital

00:12:51.580 --> 00:12:54.590
to bear and draw from as many
people within the Exploratorium

00:12:54.590 --> 00:12:56.680
as possible and make it a
two-way learning street.

00:12:56.680 --> 00:12:58.791
We don't presume, again,
to have the answers.

00:12:58.791 --> 00:13:01.040
So for us, one of the great
benefits of the work we do

00:13:01.040 --> 00:13:03.750
is not only are we
disseminating or sharing,

00:13:03.750 --> 00:13:06.720
we're learning and bringing in.

00:13:06.720 --> 00:13:13.220
And let me continue on and
talk about three projects

00:13:13.220 --> 00:13:16.850
that I think are exemplars of
our core approach for the wider

00:13:16.850 --> 00:13:18.410
world.

00:13:18.410 --> 00:13:22.550
The first is a partnership that
we have with Tubitak in Turkey.

00:13:22.550 --> 00:13:25.430
Tubitak is an analog to our
National Science Foundation

00:13:25.430 --> 00:13:26.560
in the United States.

00:13:26.560 --> 00:13:29.424
A number of years ago, they
decided in a rather bold move

00:13:29.424 --> 00:13:31.340
that they were going to
create science centers

00:13:31.340 --> 00:13:32.720
in every province in Turkey.

00:13:32.720 --> 00:13:34.700
So that would be
81 science centers.

00:13:34.700 --> 00:13:37.180
The government earmarked a
substantial amount of money.

00:13:37.180 --> 00:13:38.638
And one of the
first Science Center

00:13:38.638 --> 00:13:41.780
was in a province
called Kocaeli.

00:13:41.780 --> 00:13:45.870
Kocaeli, if you see Turkey
up here, is east by southeast

00:13:45.870 --> 00:13:47.690
from Istanbul.

00:13:47.690 --> 00:13:53.790
And the center, the capital of
Kocaeli is a town called Izmit.

00:13:53.790 --> 00:13:57.670
So the museum was going to be
created in an old paper mill

00:13:57.670 --> 00:13:58.170
factory.

00:13:58.170 --> 00:14:00.410
It's a really cool building.

00:14:00.410 --> 00:14:02.340
And the way we
partnered with them

00:14:02.340 --> 00:14:04.770
was not necessarily
just to create a museum.

00:14:04.770 --> 00:14:06.810
We actually expanded
our partnership

00:14:06.810 --> 00:14:09.450
to include professional
development capacity

00:14:09.450 --> 00:14:12.715
building, design, master
planning, and of course exhibit

00:14:12.715 --> 00:14:13.215
fabrication.

00:14:15.941 --> 00:14:18.440
So there's going to be a series
of these pictures, you know,

00:14:18.440 --> 00:14:20.130
where somebody's
looking at a drawing.

00:14:20.130 --> 00:14:21.560
And they're pointing,
and it looks like they're

00:14:21.560 --> 00:14:22.540
having important thoughts.

00:14:22.540 --> 00:14:23.350
This is the first.

00:14:23.350 --> 00:14:26.110
But around the table
is members of Tubitak,

00:14:26.110 --> 00:14:29.580
members of the municipality
from Kocaeli, and our own team.

00:14:29.580 --> 00:14:33.010
And we started off by
taking a 20,000 foot

00:14:33.010 --> 00:14:36.590
view of what they were trying
to accomplish from a science

00:14:36.590 --> 00:14:38.170
objective perspective.

00:14:38.170 --> 00:14:40.490
And we began laying out
what kinds of experiences

00:14:40.490 --> 00:14:42.637
would fit naturally
within their museum.

00:14:42.637 --> 00:14:46.047
Now, I include this
picture, because part

00:14:46.047 --> 00:14:47.630
of the work we do
all around the world

00:14:47.630 --> 00:14:50.350
means we have to
respond to the rhythms

00:14:50.350 --> 00:14:51.754
and tempo of our partners.

00:14:51.754 --> 00:14:53.170
We were just having
a conversation

00:14:53.170 --> 00:14:54.836
earlier about how we
tend to move slowly

00:14:54.836 --> 00:14:56.070
at the Exploratorium.

00:14:56.070 --> 00:14:59.280
Well, other projects tend
to move a lot more quickly.

00:14:59.280 --> 00:15:02.197
We had to design this entire
museum in three months right

00:15:02.197 --> 00:15:03.530
at the time that we were moving.

00:15:03.530 --> 00:15:05.850
So we created because
Kocaeli sweatshop.

00:15:05.850 --> 00:15:09.550
And in this room were
about 10 engineers,

00:15:09.550 --> 00:15:11.460
designers, education
professionals,

00:15:11.460 --> 00:15:14.100
all working pretty much around
the clock to try and meet

00:15:14.100 --> 00:15:18.060
what was a government deadline
in order to open their museum.

00:15:18.060 --> 00:15:21.170
That led, of course, to lay out
and plan for the museum broken

00:15:21.170 --> 00:15:24.520
out by content set,
creating 3D models of what

00:15:24.520 --> 00:15:26.730
the experience would look like.

00:15:26.730 --> 00:15:29.800
And I think it's also
important to point out that,

00:15:29.800 --> 00:15:33.056
as I said before, it wasn't just
about creating an experience

00:15:33.056 --> 00:15:33.930
and transplanting it.

00:15:33.930 --> 00:15:37.000
It was about the intersection
of cultures and human capital.

00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:39.276
So we created a professional
development program

00:15:39.276 --> 00:15:40.650
that would accompany
the exhibits

00:15:40.650 --> 00:15:43.520
and designs we created,
the experiences we created.

00:15:43.520 --> 00:15:46.350
And we did trainings
both at the Exploratorium

00:15:46.350 --> 00:15:48.300
and over in Kocaeli Turkey.

00:15:48.300 --> 00:15:50.510
There were trainings about
how you might facilitate

00:15:50.510 --> 00:15:52.620
the exhibits, how you
might scaffold them

00:15:52.620 --> 00:15:54.780
and do broader
learning experiences,

00:15:54.780 --> 00:15:57.940
and even workshops on the
nature of the organization

00:15:57.940 --> 00:16:06.080
and how you might create a
viable sustainable institution

00:16:06.080 --> 00:16:07.872
both here and in Turkey.

00:16:07.872 --> 00:16:09.330
And you can see
here these are some

00:16:09.330 --> 00:16:12.880
of the classic
Exploratorium activities.

00:16:12.880 --> 00:16:15.890
This is the cow eye dissection.

00:16:15.890 --> 00:16:19.280
And I always liked this
picture, because it shows

00:16:19.280 --> 00:16:21.430
a sense of play and wonder.

00:16:21.430 --> 00:16:24.340
It's very easy to turn this
into a mechanical process.

00:16:24.340 --> 00:16:27.090
And it's very easy to get
into layouts and designs.

00:16:27.090 --> 00:16:29.910
But the truth in the end
is it's about affect.

00:16:29.910 --> 00:16:32.170
And it's about the
wonder and the joy

00:16:32.170 --> 00:16:34.610
that comes with these
kinds of experiences.

00:16:34.610 --> 00:16:36.610
And if the staff
doesn't have that,

00:16:36.610 --> 00:16:38.180
if the culture
doesn't have that,

00:16:38.180 --> 00:16:40.400
then it's awfully hard to
translate that to visitors.

00:16:40.400 --> 00:16:43.427
So a big part of our
intersection of cultures

00:16:43.427 --> 00:16:45.010
and the professional
development we do

00:16:45.010 --> 00:16:49.700
is providing the opportunities
for that level of inspiration.

00:16:49.700 --> 00:16:52.105
We also sent a team over to
Turkey to build out a shop.

00:16:52.105 --> 00:16:53.730
It was our hope from
the very beginning

00:16:53.730 --> 00:16:56.104
when we were doing the master
planning that we would help

00:16:56.104 --> 00:16:58.510
them build the capacity
to develop and create

00:16:58.510 --> 00:17:00.260
and maintain their own exhibits.

00:17:00.260 --> 00:17:01.930
So we sent over a
team that started

00:17:01.930 --> 00:17:04.319
refurbishing a number
of exhibits on site

00:17:04.319 --> 00:17:06.119
in Turkey working
side by side with

00:17:06.119 --> 00:17:08.680
their Turkish counterparts.

00:17:08.680 --> 00:17:12.032
This was the opening of the
museum a couple months ago.

00:17:12.032 --> 00:17:13.490
And as you can tell
by the picture,

00:17:13.490 --> 00:17:15.349
it's a deeply political event.

00:17:15.349 --> 00:17:16.910
The government got
a chance to crow

00:17:16.910 --> 00:17:18.470
about the investment
that they made

00:17:18.470 --> 00:17:21.050
and the impact of
what they created.

00:17:21.050 --> 00:17:24.322
It's a very different culture
than ours in many ways.

00:17:24.322 --> 00:17:26.030
And the approach to
it is very different.

00:17:26.030 --> 00:17:27.770
And I'll touch on that
a little bit later

00:17:27.770 --> 00:17:30.356
that that had been a profound
learning experience for us.

00:17:30.356 --> 00:17:31.730
And we have so
much more to learn

00:17:31.730 --> 00:17:34.630
about the assumptions we
would make about our culture

00:17:34.630 --> 00:17:37.980
and the situation we have and
the benefits we have about how

00:17:37.980 --> 00:17:40.370
we create these kinds
of experiences, where

00:17:40.370 --> 00:17:42.840
another culture might have
an entirely different suite

00:17:42.840 --> 00:17:46.330
of obstacles and benefits.

00:17:46.330 --> 00:17:48.820
This is the President
of Turkey on the walk

00:17:48.820 --> 00:17:51.274
through with the
cohort around him.

00:17:51.274 --> 00:17:53.440
I think you can see myself
in the background, trying

00:17:53.440 --> 00:17:56.030
to keep a safe and respectful
distance and act casual.

00:17:59.380 --> 00:18:01.480
And this is some of
the final exhibition.

00:18:01.480 --> 00:18:04.860
It's actually still
being opened as we speak.

00:18:04.860 --> 00:18:08.600
But this was the optics
gallery, dark on purpose

00:18:08.600 --> 00:18:11.150
because of the phenomenon.

00:18:11.150 --> 00:18:13.820
And already you're starting
to see the kind of engagement

00:18:13.820 --> 00:18:17.610
that we hope to see and
ultimately the reason why

00:18:17.610 --> 00:18:20.810
we do what we do.

00:18:20.810 --> 00:18:21.310
All right.

00:18:21.310 --> 00:18:25.130
So that was Kocaeli, Turkey.

00:18:25.130 --> 00:18:25.910
Tinkering.

00:18:25.910 --> 00:18:29.670
We created a tinkering
studio in Saudi Arabia.

00:18:29.670 --> 00:18:32.950
Now I left out before one of
the most important aspects

00:18:32.950 --> 00:18:34.990
of the new direction
of Global Studios

00:18:34.990 --> 00:18:37.430
is we are looking to
create experiences

00:18:37.430 --> 00:18:42.170
beyond just museums and
informal centers of learning.

00:18:42.170 --> 00:18:44.320
This is not something
that we've created.

00:18:44.320 --> 00:18:46.750
We firmly believe
that there's learning

00:18:46.750 --> 00:18:49.067
happening in more and
more and more places.

00:18:49.067 --> 00:18:49.900
That's a good thing.

00:18:49.900 --> 00:18:53.170
There's a greater access to
tools, learning materials.

00:18:53.170 --> 00:18:55.310
There's a
democratization of ideas.

00:18:55.310 --> 00:18:58.550
So how do we do what we do
beyond the settings in which we

00:18:58.550 --> 00:19:01.460
are, in theory, so comfortable?

00:19:01.460 --> 00:19:03.670
So we created a
Tinkering program

00:19:03.670 --> 00:19:06.400
in Al Khobar,
Saudi Arabia, which

00:19:06.400 --> 00:19:08.820
is on the Gulf side
of Saudi Arabia.

00:19:08.820 --> 00:19:10.820
This is an audacious
project for us.

00:19:10.820 --> 00:19:13.790
This was not, on the surface,
an easy place to work.

00:19:13.790 --> 00:19:15.430
And our goals were huge.

00:19:15.430 --> 00:19:18.640
Once again, we did not want to
just create a Tinkering studio,

00:19:18.640 --> 00:19:20.190
lift it from the Exploratorium.

00:19:20.190 --> 00:19:22.190
This is a picture of our
Tinkering studio, which

00:19:22.190 --> 00:19:25.010
is hands on making an
exploration of materials

00:19:25.010 --> 00:19:26.500
on our floor.

00:19:26.500 --> 00:19:28.150
Already in a museum
setting, this

00:19:28.150 --> 00:19:32.070
is an innovative
approach to learning.

00:19:32.070 --> 00:19:35.330
And many museums
around the country

00:19:35.330 --> 00:19:36.960
are working to
figure out just how

00:19:36.960 --> 00:19:39.910
you might do this in a
museum environment, nevermind

00:19:39.910 --> 00:19:43.010
in a foreign country
without all of the amenities

00:19:43.010 --> 00:19:44.730
that you would have in a museum.

00:19:44.730 --> 00:19:47.450
And not only
creating a museum, we

00:19:47.450 --> 00:19:49.390
wanted to create the
capacity for people

00:19:49.390 --> 00:19:51.930
to facilitate and train and
lead the activities that

00:19:51.930 --> 00:19:56.030
are associated with Tinkering
on their own after we had left.

00:19:58.730 --> 00:20:00.520
Once again, in SketchUp
we created a model

00:20:00.520 --> 00:20:01.520
of what it might look like.

00:20:01.520 --> 00:20:03.728
The great challenge here
was, you'll see in a second,

00:20:03.728 --> 00:20:06.860
this is happening in a
tent in a big open area.

00:20:06.860 --> 00:20:10.090
And the activities
in Tinkering require

00:20:10.090 --> 00:20:12.510
a certain focus
and contemplation

00:20:12.510 --> 00:20:15.070
and a well-defined space.

00:20:15.070 --> 00:20:18.620
So we did our best to
try and create that.

00:20:18.620 --> 00:20:21.150
Right up here you can see
this big open patch of sand

00:20:21.150 --> 00:20:23.000
is where the event
was going to happen.

00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:25.040
It was sponsored
by Saudi Aramco.

00:20:25.040 --> 00:20:28.760
And their headquarters
are here in Al Khobar.

00:20:28.760 --> 00:20:32.190
And in a matter of
weeks what sprung up

00:20:32.190 --> 00:20:35.330
from this patch of sand was
nothing short of remarkable.

00:20:35.330 --> 00:20:36.705
First, the tents are erected.

00:20:40.690 --> 00:20:43.240
And this is our truck showing
up with a Tinkering studio

00:20:43.240 --> 00:20:44.740
in boxes.

00:20:44.740 --> 00:20:47.210
And our tinkering
studio sat outside

00:20:47.210 --> 00:20:50.400
in 120 degree heat and sand.

00:20:50.400 --> 00:20:55.300
So we had to do a serious amount
of remediation in the field,

00:20:55.300 --> 00:20:57.060
particularly for
the group that is

00:20:57.060 --> 00:21:00.080
very particular about the
nature of their experience,

00:21:00.080 --> 00:21:04.120
and the comfort level,
the accessibility,

00:21:04.120 --> 00:21:08.040
the invitation that exists by
creating a space like this.

00:21:08.040 --> 00:21:11.080
We found that just as a
side note that it was so hot

00:21:11.080 --> 00:21:13.640
that-- are you familiar with
butcher block like yea thick?

00:21:13.640 --> 00:21:15.640
It was cracking
that in half, which

00:21:15.640 --> 00:21:18.130
is not supposed to happen.

00:21:18.130 --> 00:21:20.820
So we needed a lot
of work in the field.

00:21:20.820 --> 00:21:23.240
Now I don't know if anybody
here can read Arabic,

00:21:23.240 --> 00:21:25.530
but I'll bet you know
that branding scheme.

00:21:25.530 --> 00:21:27.780
It's the same in Saudi
Arabia as it is here.

00:21:27.780 --> 00:21:30.060
There were a lot
of trips to Ikea

00:21:30.060 --> 00:21:32.274
in trying to turn
what we had created

00:21:32.274 --> 00:21:33.690
and what we hoped
would transplant

00:21:33.690 --> 00:21:38.110
nicely to a tent in Saudi Arabia
into a rather warm environment.

00:21:42.010 --> 00:21:44.620
Now as I mentioned before,
creating the physical space

00:21:44.620 --> 00:21:46.410
was just part of the program.

00:21:46.410 --> 00:21:49.010
We began immediately even as
we were setting up the space,

00:21:49.010 --> 00:21:52.210
training 16 Saudi
educators that were

00:21:52.210 --> 00:21:56.680
chosen to work alongside of
the educators there we sent.

00:21:56.680 --> 00:22:01.880
So we sent around 8 to 12
educators in pairs of two

00:22:01.880 --> 00:22:03.970
over the course of
this five week festival

00:22:03.970 --> 00:22:07.280
to work alongside their
counterparts for Saudi Arabia,

00:22:07.280 --> 00:22:10.170
thereby training them
hands-on in the facilitation

00:22:10.170 --> 00:22:12.370
of the Tinkering activities.

00:22:12.370 --> 00:22:14.925
This is what the tent looked
like on opening night.

00:22:14.925 --> 00:22:16.800
And remember how I said
we're trying to focus

00:22:16.800 --> 00:22:19.150
on contemplative activities?

00:22:19.150 --> 00:22:23.610
Very quickly the space
turned into this.

00:22:23.610 --> 00:22:25.000
And it was a zoo.

00:22:25.000 --> 00:22:29.310
There were over 5,000 people
that came on average every day.

00:22:29.310 --> 00:22:32.690
And yet, at the same
time if we zoom in,

00:22:32.690 --> 00:22:35.890
we actually were able to create
these intimate experiences,

00:22:35.890 --> 00:22:39.240
these moments of learning,
of inquiry, of joy.

00:22:39.240 --> 00:22:41.210
And some of the best
pictures I've ever seen

00:22:41.210 --> 00:22:42.900
came from this project
in Saudi Arabia.

00:22:46.340 --> 00:22:49.040
This is actually one of
my favorite pictures.

00:22:49.040 --> 00:22:51.500
If the eyes can
telegraph anything,

00:22:51.500 --> 00:22:56.200
you can see the joy, the wonder,
the sense of accomplishment,

00:22:56.200 --> 00:22:57.070
of agency.

00:22:57.070 --> 00:22:59.270
And these are things we
worked so hard to achieve.

00:22:59.270 --> 00:23:04.190
On the note of culture, maybe
even preempting some questions,

00:23:04.190 --> 00:23:06.240
working in a place
like Saudi Arabia that

00:23:06.240 --> 00:23:09.010
has such a profoundly
different culture from ours

00:23:09.010 --> 00:23:12.030
raised all kinds of
interesting considerations

00:23:12.030 --> 00:23:13.090
as you can imagine.

00:23:13.090 --> 00:23:15.080
It is not our place to
judge other cultures.

00:23:15.080 --> 00:23:17.760
And it's not our place to
say what is right or wrong.

00:23:17.760 --> 00:23:21.770
And at the same time, there
was one very specific question

00:23:21.770 --> 00:23:23.200
and that was gender.

00:23:23.200 --> 00:23:27.100
So working in Saudi Arabia,
it's a much different society.

00:23:27.100 --> 00:23:29.602
And from our perspective,
we had conversation

00:23:29.602 --> 00:23:31.310
about how we might
approach that, indeed,

00:23:31.310 --> 00:23:32.900
even if we would approach it.

00:23:32.900 --> 00:23:36.470
And in the end,
from what we figured

00:23:36.470 --> 00:23:39.800
is the impact of
doing what we do,

00:23:39.800 --> 00:23:44.450
which should be culture
agnostic, learning, inquiry,

00:23:44.450 --> 00:23:47.730
agency, all of these things,
we felt have their own merit

00:23:47.730 --> 00:23:48.804
and are important.

00:23:48.804 --> 00:23:50.220
There was one thing
that we wanted

00:23:50.220 --> 00:23:53.540
was that both the participants
in the booth and those

00:23:53.540 --> 00:23:56.620
that we trained would
be of mixed gender.

00:23:56.620 --> 00:23:59.870
It was the one stipulation
that we presumed to make.

00:23:59.870 --> 00:24:00.940
And it was OK.

00:24:00.940 --> 00:24:04.230
So in the end, we had both
men and women in the booth.

00:24:04.230 --> 00:24:06.880
And we had both men and women
being trained as facilitators.

00:24:09.845 --> 00:24:11.220
One of my favorite
pictures also.

00:24:16.200 --> 00:24:18.560
Now the professional
development didn't end just

00:24:18.560 --> 00:24:20.030
at the beginning of the project.

00:24:20.030 --> 00:24:22.950
We made it a point on a
daily and weekly basis

00:24:22.950 --> 00:24:25.430
to continue discussion
and dialogue

00:24:25.430 --> 00:24:28.610
about what we were doing and how
we were doing it with the goal

00:24:28.610 --> 00:24:30.540
by the end of the
five week festival

00:24:30.540 --> 00:24:34.390
transferring facilitation
of the booth 100%

00:24:34.390 --> 00:24:36.170
to the Saudi facilitators.

00:24:36.170 --> 00:24:38.621
And that's exactly what we did.

00:24:38.621 --> 00:24:40.620
They're wearing some of
the Exploratorium vests.

00:24:40.620 --> 00:24:42.890
And as you can see, by
the end of the festival,

00:24:42.890 --> 00:24:47.700
our facilitators had
receded into the background.

00:24:47.700 --> 00:24:50.100
And not only were they working
on facilitating the booth.

00:24:50.100 --> 00:24:51.808
They were maintaining,
as you can imagine

00:24:51.808 --> 00:24:53.960
in that kind of heat
and that kind of usage,

00:24:53.960 --> 00:24:58.270
it was a constant battle, if you
will, just to keep everything

00:24:58.270 --> 00:25:01.010
in working order.

00:25:01.010 --> 00:25:02.860
And then on an ongoing basis.

00:25:02.860 --> 00:25:05.610
This is just a picture
of a social media page.

00:25:05.610 --> 00:25:07.580
We had hoped, and it
turned out to be so,

00:25:07.580 --> 00:25:09.559
we would leave the
Tinkering studio behind.

00:25:09.559 --> 00:25:11.100
And we would leave
behind communities

00:25:11.100 --> 00:25:14.370
that were inspired to continue
these kinds of activities.

00:25:14.370 --> 00:25:17.814
And the Tinkering studio
is still in Saudi Arabia.

00:25:17.814 --> 00:25:19.480
And it's traveling
from cultural program

00:25:19.480 --> 00:25:23.240
to cultural program with a
permanent home in a museum

00:25:23.240 --> 00:25:25.410
in the capital of Riyadh.

00:25:25.410 --> 00:25:27.710
And the connections that
were made between us

00:25:27.710 --> 00:25:30.490
at the Exploratorium and our
counterparts in Saudi Arabia

00:25:30.490 --> 00:25:33.890
continue to this day.

00:25:33.890 --> 00:25:36.390
So the third project
I'd like to share

00:25:36.390 --> 00:25:44.350
is right here at home at UTSF
Benioff Children's Hospital.

00:25:44.350 --> 00:25:48.030
This was closer to home, but
also a radically new project

00:25:48.030 --> 00:25:50.040
for us with, as you
can imagine, it's

00:25:50.040 --> 00:25:53.010
own considerations
and constraints.

00:25:53.010 --> 00:25:56.010
The genesis of the project
was through a group

00:25:56.010 --> 00:25:59.190
called Child Life that
operates a learning

00:25:59.190 --> 00:26:01.170
center within the hospital.

00:26:01.170 --> 00:26:05.070
And they have San Francisco
unified accredited school

00:26:05.070 --> 00:26:05.970
as well.

00:26:05.970 --> 00:26:08.900
They had already worked
with the Exploratorium

00:26:08.900 --> 00:26:11.014
in outreach programs and
activities for years.

00:26:11.014 --> 00:26:12.430
So there was already
relationship.

00:26:12.430 --> 00:26:15.200
And they were moving themselves
from their Parnassus campus

00:26:15.200 --> 00:26:18.220
to their new campus
in Mission Bay.

00:26:18.220 --> 00:26:22.240
We had to step back and think
about visitorship, obviously,

00:26:22.240 --> 00:26:23.890
in a whole new way.

00:26:23.890 --> 00:26:27.290
And we had so much to
learn about what happens

00:26:27.290 --> 00:26:29.060
in that kind of environment.

00:26:29.060 --> 00:26:33.180
And so many of the assumptions
that we would have going in we

00:26:33.180 --> 00:26:35.730
were challenged with
right out of the gate.

00:26:35.730 --> 00:26:39.660
One example is, and this may
be obvious on the surface,

00:26:39.660 --> 00:26:43.820
but the people who use those
exhibits are not only patients.

00:26:43.820 --> 00:26:46.330
They're siblings of patients,
they're family members,

00:26:46.330 --> 00:26:48.910
they're people who come
to vision patients.

00:26:48.910 --> 00:26:53.100
And there's a wide variety,
as wide as you can imagine,

00:26:53.100 --> 00:27:01.680
of ability and presence
and state of being.

00:27:01.680 --> 00:27:03.280
And we couldn't
cater to just one.

00:27:03.280 --> 00:27:04.738
And in fact, that
would be a shame.

00:27:04.738 --> 00:27:07.890
How do you make it so
different levels of ability

00:27:07.890 --> 00:27:09.730
can experience what we create?

00:27:09.730 --> 00:27:14.870
The other aspect of the building
is-- the obligatory design

00:27:14.870 --> 00:27:17.040
picture.

00:27:17.040 --> 00:27:18.550
That hospital is immense.

00:27:18.550 --> 00:27:20.950
And there's way more opportunity
than we could possibly

00:27:20.950 --> 00:27:22.510
do in one project
or could possibly

00:27:22.510 --> 00:27:24.830
do before we learn
enough to do it.

00:27:24.830 --> 00:27:27.150
So we had to look at
the entire environment

00:27:27.150 --> 00:27:32.800
and choose where we would
start off with our experiences.

00:27:32.800 --> 00:27:35.670
This is our high
tech database system

00:27:35.670 --> 00:27:37.730
that's showing
exactly how we would

00:27:37.730 --> 00:27:40.540
approach the different exhibits
and different experiences.

00:27:40.540 --> 00:27:42.350
And then, of course,
we began sketching.

00:27:42.350 --> 00:27:44.880
And we were looking at hallways.

00:27:44.880 --> 00:27:49.090
We were looking at alcoves at
the edge of the museum, pieces

00:27:49.090 --> 00:27:53.640
in the lobby, and of
course in patients' rooms.

00:27:53.640 --> 00:27:56.180
Again, as you can imagine,
much different levels

00:27:56.180 --> 00:27:59.320
of activity and engagement
in each of these places.

00:28:01.635 --> 00:28:03.385
We began prototyping
with our counterparts

00:28:03.385 --> 00:28:05.720
at UCSF, who were just
a pleasure to work with.

00:28:05.720 --> 00:28:09.440
There was so much simpatico
about our approach to learning.

00:28:09.440 --> 00:28:13.370
Prototyping colored
shadows exhibit.

00:28:13.370 --> 00:28:15.610
And of course, we
got into the building

00:28:15.610 --> 00:28:18.580
and prototyped in
the room itself.

00:28:18.580 --> 00:28:21.360
This is an animation
station, where

00:28:21.360 --> 00:28:24.440
you're able to move different
pieces and materials

00:28:24.440 --> 00:28:27.860
and create your own animations.

00:28:27.860 --> 00:28:30.580
And in the end it led
to a piece in the lobby,

00:28:30.580 --> 00:28:35.620
which is a polarized
lenses going over scotch

00:28:35.620 --> 00:28:39.420
tape and glass or acrylic.

00:28:39.420 --> 00:28:42.120
And if you look at each
of these works of art,

00:28:42.120 --> 00:28:43.050
they're participatory.

00:28:43.050 --> 00:28:44.330
We didn't create them.

00:28:44.330 --> 00:28:48.080
They're actually being created
by patients up in their rooms

00:28:48.080 --> 00:28:49.710
or wherever they're
able to be working.

00:28:49.710 --> 00:28:51.070
So it can be done
in a classroom.

00:28:51.070 --> 00:28:53.153
It could be done in their
room if they can't move.

00:28:53.153 --> 00:28:55.840
Even some of the more ill
and long term patients

00:28:55.840 --> 00:28:58.930
can still be doing this
in their own spaces

00:28:58.930 --> 00:29:01.370
and have a way of
sharing what you do

00:29:01.370 --> 00:29:02.990
with the rest of the hospital.

00:29:02.990 --> 00:29:05.790
And I haven't talked
a lot about the goals.

00:29:05.790 --> 00:29:08.120
But in a setting
like this, it was

00:29:08.120 --> 00:29:09.910
really important to
the child life experts

00:29:09.910 --> 00:29:11.450
that it was indeed about that.

00:29:11.450 --> 00:29:14.600
It was about life and the
fact that learning is still

00:29:14.600 --> 00:29:17.290
continuing, and you are
able to explore and do

00:29:17.290 --> 00:29:18.810
whatever you are able to do.

00:29:18.810 --> 00:29:25.130
It was an incredibly
moving project to work on.

00:29:25.130 --> 00:29:27.020
We created exhibits
and experiences

00:29:27.020 --> 00:29:28.670
in a surgical waiting area.

00:29:28.670 --> 00:29:30.580
A lot of classical
Exploratorium exhibits

00:29:30.580 --> 00:29:32.900
chosen to be
contemplative in a space

00:29:32.900 --> 00:29:35.670
that you do not want to be
incredibly active in, because

00:29:35.670 --> 00:29:37.340
of the nature of the space.

00:29:37.340 --> 00:29:41.442
We created a time lapse exhibit
looking out over the bay.

00:29:41.442 --> 00:29:43.900
So there's a beautiful view
from the new Mission Bay campus

00:29:43.900 --> 00:29:45.450
looking out over the bay.

00:29:45.450 --> 00:29:49.610
And you can scrub through
a day at different speeds.

00:29:49.610 --> 00:29:51.610
And it's actually
quite fascinating.

00:29:51.610 --> 00:29:53.150
Ships are coming and going.

00:29:53.150 --> 00:29:54.430
Weather patterns are changing.

00:29:54.430 --> 00:29:56.471
And again, this is a way
of getting something out

00:29:56.471 --> 00:29:58.890
of what might feel like
the alternate reality

00:29:58.890 --> 00:30:00.680
of their confined
hospital environment,

00:30:00.680 --> 00:30:04.910
exploring phenomena
in the real world.

00:30:04.910 --> 00:30:06.879
We created images on the wall.

00:30:06.879 --> 00:30:08.420
Again, something
very simple, doesn't

00:30:08.420 --> 00:30:10.830
require a lot of
interactivity or hands-on,

00:30:10.830 --> 00:30:14.110
but still a
content-rich experience.

00:30:14.110 --> 00:30:16.890
We programmed the garage.

00:30:16.890 --> 00:30:22.070
Very simple here, we created
animals and pixelated dots

00:30:22.070 --> 00:30:23.685
for each floor of the garage.

00:30:26.390 --> 00:30:29.060
A scope in a patient's room.

00:30:29.060 --> 00:30:31.870
The animation station
that I just mentioned.

00:30:31.870 --> 00:30:34.090
And the final embodiment
of the colored shadows,

00:30:34.090 --> 00:30:38.180
which is just a wonderful
exhibit a very playful exhibit

00:30:38.180 --> 00:30:41.890
where really the only
goal is exploring

00:30:41.890 --> 00:30:43.710
the phenomenon of
light and optics

00:30:43.710 --> 00:30:49.140
and transforming an
environment into a work of art.

00:30:51.810 --> 00:30:55.670
So if you step back and
look at this body of work,

00:30:55.670 --> 00:30:57.630
you can tell that
from our perspective

00:30:57.630 --> 00:31:00.040
we're just scratching
the surface.

00:31:00.040 --> 00:31:02.040
Each of these areas
we chose because we

00:31:02.040 --> 00:31:03.780
hope that it's extensible.

00:31:03.780 --> 00:31:05.580
We worked in one hospital.

00:31:05.580 --> 00:31:09.240
Our hope and the hope of
the folks at Mission Bay

00:31:09.240 --> 00:31:11.660
is that we have
created a model for how

00:31:11.660 --> 00:31:13.180
you might work with hospitals.

00:31:13.180 --> 00:31:15.100
In Tinkering, we
created a model for how

00:31:15.100 --> 00:31:18.570
you might take something that
is in one sense something

00:31:18.570 --> 00:31:20.260
so particular to
the Exploratorium

00:31:20.260 --> 00:31:22.800
and relies on such
particular constraints

00:31:22.800 --> 00:31:25.080
and put it out into
the world in places

00:31:25.080 --> 00:31:28.250
where you do not have
controls on those constraints

00:31:28.250 --> 00:31:31.380
and create broader experiences.

00:31:31.380 --> 00:31:33.010
And our approach
to museum making,

00:31:33.010 --> 00:31:35.790
even though they might seem
conventional on the surface,

00:31:35.790 --> 00:31:39.350
that if you were to
create new science

00:31:39.350 --> 00:31:42.380
centers around the world,
can we take an approach that

00:31:42.380 --> 00:31:45.190
is as focused on
culture and learning

00:31:45.190 --> 00:31:49.330
and affect as it is on
design and exhibits?

00:31:49.330 --> 00:31:51.970
Over the last three years,
Global Studios breadth

00:31:51.970 --> 00:31:53.170
has grown.

00:31:53.170 --> 00:31:56.749
We are four times in
scope what we were before.

00:31:56.749 --> 00:31:59.290
I know that might be another
day in the office in the valley.

00:31:59.290 --> 00:32:01.850
But where we are,
that's profound growth.

00:32:01.850 --> 00:32:05.150
And we see that as just
the tip of the iceberg.

00:32:05.150 --> 00:32:07.910
So with that, I guess
I'll pause and see

00:32:07.910 --> 00:32:10.454
if there are any questions.

00:32:10.454 --> 00:32:12.370
FEMALE SPEAKER: Have you
ever worked with kids

00:32:12.370 --> 00:32:16.210
to come up with ideas
for your exhibit?

00:32:16.210 --> 00:32:17.700
ADAM TOBIN: That's
a good question.

00:32:17.700 --> 00:32:19.810
I mean, there's two
answers to that.

00:32:19.810 --> 00:32:22.930
The first is the way
that we prototype,

00:32:22.930 --> 00:32:25.210
the ideas are out
on the floor and so

00:32:25.210 --> 00:32:29.060
constantly refined, that it's
hard to say that they're not.

00:32:29.060 --> 00:32:29.670
Right?

00:32:29.670 --> 00:32:31.480
They're a part of
the team that allows

00:32:31.480 --> 00:32:32.880
us to create what we create.

00:32:32.880 --> 00:32:34.720
I didn't mention
this on the outset,

00:32:34.720 --> 00:32:37.380
but we see our floor as
a learning laboratory,

00:32:37.380 --> 00:32:39.670
as a research crucible.

00:32:39.670 --> 00:32:42.750
And the visitors are
a huge part of that.

00:32:42.750 --> 00:32:44.990
The other answer is one
of our great interests

00:32:44.990 --> 00:32:46.790
as part of the move
was finding a way

00:32:46.790 --> 00:32:50.140
of engaging more and more people
into our creative process.

00:32:50.140 --> 00:32:52.700
So you could say that
x% of the Exploratorium

00:32:52.700 --> 00:32:54.390
wasn't even created here.

00:32:54.390 --> 00:32:55.630
We still have a ways to go.

00:32:55.630 --> 00:32:59.574
But it's something that we're
very much interested in.

00:32:59.574 --> 00:33:01.740
AUDIENCE: What's the minimal
level of infrastructure

00:33:01.740 --> 00:33:06.320
required for you to do one of
these mobile Exploratoriums,

00:33:06.320 --> 00:33:08.980
electric power,
water, et cetera?

00:33:08.980 --> 00:33:10.920
ADAM TOBIN: That's
a great question.

00:33:10.920 --> 00:33:16.760
My knee jerk answer is I
want to say zero, right?

00:33:16.760 --> 00:33:18.290
If you look at the
Teacher Institute

00:33:18.290 --> 00:33:19.980
and you look at the
snacks that they've

00:33:19.980 --> 00:33:23.505
created that are very
lightweight versions

00:33:23.505 --> 00:33:25.560
of the phenomena rich
exhibits that we've

00:33:25.560 --> 00:33:27.930
created over the years, that
you could do it just with

00:33:27.930 --> 00:33:31.210
found objects and
a table, right?

00:33:31.210 --> 00:33:36.100
So really I think it's about the
scale and depth of engagement.

00:33:36.100 --> 00:33:37.980
For Global Studios, for
my particular group,

00:33:37.980 --> 00:33:42.220
we tend to be at a larger scale,
where our partners are often

00:33:42.220 --> 00:33:48.250
institutions or
countries or governments,

00:33:48.250 --> 00:33:50.640
educational groups that
have the resources to try

00:33:50.640 --> 00:33:53.180
and manifest something
at a larger scale.

00:33:53.180 --> 00:33:55.690
But we always try
and think small

00:33:55.690 --> 00:33:58.260
when it comes to the actual
experiences themselves.

00:33:58.260 --> 00:34:04.089
So I would hate to answer with
a threshold that would eliminate

00:34:04.089 --> 00:34:05.630
the kind of experiences
we would want

00:34:05.630 --> 00:34:09.739
to create in any given setting.

00:34:09.739 --> 00:34:13.300
AUDIENCE: Do you
ever have a mandate?

00:34:13.300 --> 00:34:17.020
So for example, perhaps
the museum in Turkey,

00:34:17.020 --> 00:34:20.719
you must cover-- I noticed
the solar system was on there.

00:34:20.719 --> 00:34:21.800
And that one struck me.

00:34:21.800 --> 00:34:24.800
Because I thought how do you
tinker about the solar system?

00:34:24.800 --> 00:34:28.400
You can't send people to Mars.

00:34:28.400 --> 00:34:32.489
And I guess my question was
did that come organically?

00:34:32.489 --> 00:34:34.618
Or was that kind of
part of the agreement

00:34:34.618 --> 00:34:36.659
was that that was something
they wanted to cover,

00:34:36.659 --> 00:34:39.421
and you had to figure out how
to approach that subject matter?

00:34:39.421 --> 00:34:40.920
ADAM TOBIN: That's
a great question.

00:34:40.920 --> 00:34:43.350
I mean, interestingly enough
the Exploratorium approach

00:34:43.350 --> 00:34:46.040
tends to be content agnostic.

00:34:46.040 --> 00:34:48.389
It's more important to
us to learning pathway

00:34:48.389 --> 00:34:51.600
than a particular
learning outcome.

00:34:51.600 --> 00:34:53.960
That said, that
isn't necessarily

00:34:53.960 --> 00:34:56.560
the point of departure
for our would-be partners

00:34:56.560 --> 00:34:58.420
and colleagues all
around the world.

00:34:58.420 --> 00:35:01.754
And it's a question that we
have to answer constantly.

00:35:01.754 --> 00:35:03.920
The further upstream we are
in the creative process,

00:35:03.920 --> 00:35:05.794
the easier it is for us
to have conversations

00:35:05.794 --> 00:35:09.240
about how important it is
to think about the learning

00:35:09.240 --> 00:35:12.100
culture you want to create,
the pedagogical approach

00:35:12.100 --> 00:35:13.790
to learning, as
opposed to saying

00:35:13.790 --> 00:35:15.370
that this is about
nuclear power,

00:35:15.370 --> 00:35:16.455
or it's about solar power.

00:35:16.455 --> 00:35:18.330
Power comes up a lot,
particularly as you can

00:35:18.330 --> 00:35:20.670
imagine, in the Middle East.

00:35:20.670 --> 00:35:24.930
Some projects it's already so
woven into their expectations

00:35:24.930 --> 00:35:27.280
that it's not something
that we could change.

00:35:27.280 --> 00:35:31.955
And then there's a question
of how literal we have to be.

00:35:31.955 --> 00:35:34.360
You can imagine that
if it's about power,

00:35:34.360 --> 00:35:36.460
there are a bunch of
exhibits at the Exploratorium

00:35:36.460 --> 00:35:36.950
that would work.

00:35:36.950 --> 00:35:38.880
Because of the fundamental
science below it

00:35:38.880 --> 00:35:43.040
as opposed to a didactic
demonstration of this

00:35:43.040 --> 00:35:43.990
is solar power.

00:35:43.990 --> 00:35:46.079
And here's a model
that shows solar power,

00:35:46.079 --> 00:35:48.120
so you can get excited
about solar power and care

00:35:48.120 --> 00:35:53.160
about maybe this company
that's behind the exhibition.

00:35:53.160 --> 00:35:56.030
We're very careful about
how we choose our partners.

00:35:56.030 --> 00:35:59.160
We don't think there's anything
wrong about having a content

00:35:59.160 --> 00:35:59.946
outcome.

00:35:59.946 --> 00:36:01.320
But we find that
are partnerships

00:36:01.320 --> 00:36:06.250
work best when we are not
restricted to a predetermined

00:36:06.250 --> 00:36:10.820
content set or at least the
embodiment of how you approach

00:36:10.820 --> 00:36:13.275
that content set from an
experiential standpoint

00:36:13.275 --> 00:36:14.406
if that makes sense.

00:36:14.406 --> 00:36:16.780
AUDIENCE: I saw, as you were
going through the galleries,

00:36:16.780 --> 00:36:18.330
you had the science of sharing.

00:36:18.330 --> 00:36:20.780
And then I was at
the Exploratorium

00:36:20.780 --> 00:36:23.860
and I saw a lot of the more
classic experiments that were

00:36:23.860 --> 00:36:25.559
from like the '70s let's say.

00:36:25.559 --> 00:36:27.100
I guess, when you're
looking forward,

00:36:27.100 --> 00:36:29.272
what do you think the
experiments of the future

00:36:29.272 --> 00:36:30.230
are going to look like?

00:36:30.230 --> 00:36:31.855
Because they do kind
of feel different,

00:36:31.855 --> 00:36:34.550
those Science of Sharing
exhibits from the earlier ones.

00:36:34.550 --> 00:36:36.700
I mean, where do you
kind of see things going?

00:36:36.700 --> 00:36:38.241
ADAM TOBIN: Yeah,
I mean, it's funny.

00:36:38.241 --> 00:36:41.240
As I was joking early on
about how hard it would

00:36:41.240 --> 00:36:44.382
be to try to get everything I
would want to say into a talk,

00:36:44.382 --> 00:36:45.840
the Science of
Sharing areas is one

00:36:45.840 --> 00:36:47.950
of the most interesting
areas we're working on.

00:36:47.950 --> 00:36:52.300
And I would start by saying that
even within the Exploratorium,

00:36:52.300 --> 00:36:55.334
when there was first dialogue
about approaching sociology

00:36:55.334 --> 00:36:57.250
as a content set in
Science and Sharing, there

00:36:57.250 --> 00:36:59.490
internal dialogue about
whether it could be done.

00:36:59.490 --> 00:37:02.690
And more specifically, whether
it could be done the way

00:37:02.690 --> 00:37:04.220
we like to do it.

00:37:04.220 --> 00:37:06.260
More specifically,
authentic phenomena.

00:37:06.260 --> 00:37:06.820
Right?

00:37:06.820 --> 00:37:10.824
So how do you translate
people and sharing

00:37:10.824 --> 00:37:12.240
into something
that would be other

00:37:12.240 --> 00:37:14.927
than a model or a simulation
of that or a computer screen

00:37:14.927 --> 00:37:17.260
that says here's how people
share and here's what it is?

00:37:17.260 --> 00:37:18.468
That was our great challenge.

00:37:21.090 --> 00:37:22.239
We've done it.

00:37:22.239 --> 00:37:23.530
And I think we've done it well.

00:37:23.530 --> 00:37:25.110
But we have a lot to learn.

00:37:25.110 --> 00:37:26.660
If you were to look
at that gallery,

00:37:26.660 --> 00:37:29.040
it has less of
that frenetic feel

00:37:29.040 --> 00:37:31.430
that you might see in our
central gallery, where

00:37:31.430 --> 00:37:34.880
people are bouncing from exhibit
and there's a lot of stimuli.

00:37:34.880 --> 00:37:37.171
In the West gallery,
the Science of Sharing,

00:37:37.171 --> 00:37:38.670
there's a little
more stepping back.

00:37:38.670 --> 00:37:40.190
It's a little more
contemplative.

00:37:40.190 --> 00:37:41.850
And interestingly
enough, our answer

00:37:41.850 --> 00:37:45.870
to how you make it authentic
phenomena is the visitors.

00:37:45.870 --> 00:37:47.510
are the exhibit.

00:37:47.510 --> 00:37:50.090
So a great example would
be our trust fountain,

00:37:50.090 --> 00:37:51.840
which is what we call
sip or squirt, which

00:37:51.840 --> 00:37:54.070
is a play on the
prisoner's dilemma,

00:37:54.070 --> 00:37:58.410
the classic sociological
phenomenon where

00:37:58.410 --> 00:38:03.191
if two people are arrested,
they're in cahoots.

00:38:03.191 --> 00:38:04.440
They're put in separate rooms.

00:38:04.440 --> 00:38:06.980
And basically you say, you rat
out your friend, you go free.

00:38:06.980 --> 00:38:08.845
You rat out your
friend, you go free.

00:38:08.845 --> 00:38:11.407
And if they both rat each other
out, they both go to jail.

00:38:11.407 --> 00:38:13.490
If neither one rats each
other, they both go free.

00:38:13.490 --> 00:38:15.630
And if one rats one out,
then one goes to jail

00:38:15.630 --> 00:38:17.650
and one doesn't, and vice versa.

00:38:17.650 --> 00:38:19.210
So we created a
water fountain, which

00:38:19.210 --> 00:38:21.850
is called sip or squirt, where
you can choose whether you

00:38:21.850 --> 00:38:23.700
give a sip of
water to the person

00:38:23.700 --> 00:38:25.000
across from you or a squirt.

00:38:25.000 --> 00:38:28.360
And it follows those same rules,
a squirt of water in the face.

00:38:28.360 --> 00:38:30.571
And so the nature of the
phenomena isn't so much--

00:38:30.571 --> 00:38:33.070
or I should say, isn't only the
two people playing the game.

00:38:33.070 --> 00:38:36.080
It's the people who are
standing around observing.

00:38:36.080 --> 00:38:37.420
And you get into game theory.

00:38:37.420 --> 00:38:41.260
And you get into the
actual phenomena itself

00:38:41.260 --> 00:38:43.170
in an observational way.

00:38:43.170 --> 00:38:44.670
So it is different for us.

00:38:44.670 --> 00:38:48.390
I think we have so
much more to learn.

00:38:48.390 --> 00:38:52.470
But it's also part of
our own growth in that

00:38:52.470 --> 00:38:54.500
for it to be an
authentic Exploratorium

00:38:54.500 --> 00:38:56.900
experience and a deep
learning experience,

00:38:56.900 --> 00:39:00.027
does it have to look
the way it always has?

00:39:00.027 --> 00:39:02.360
And one of the great promises,
again, of the move for us

00:39:02.360 --> 00:39:05.560
was perhaps getting us out
of our own comfort zone.

00:39:05.560 --> 00:39:07.280
It's one of the
reasons we presume

00:39:07.280 --> 00:39:09.390
to be able to work
with the world in ways

00:39:09.390 --> 00:39:11.880
that we do now,
where they don't have

00:39:11.880 --> 00:39:16.010
the same expectations that
we would for our experience.

00:39:16.010 --> 00:39:20.070
So I don't know where
that goes in time.

00:39:20.070 --> 00:39:22.940
But I think the fact that we're
pushing on those parameters

00:39:22.940 --> 00:39:25.900
and playing in that
way is actually us

00:39:25.900 --> 00:39:29.677
being true to ourselves in
some new and interesting ways.

00:39:29.677 --> 00:39:31.510
AUDIENCE: I'm curious
if you could talk more

00:39:31.510 --> 00:39:34.170
about what you said
about culture being

00:39:34.170 --> 00:39:37.830
sort of a hard road block when
you're going to a new country.

00:39:37.830 --> 00:39:40.144
How do you figure
out what you need

00:39:40.144 --> 00:39:42.310
to change about the exhibits
for different cultures?

00:39:42.310 --> 00:39:44.632
And how do you figure
out what's going to work?

00:39:44.632 --> 00:39:45.340
ADAM TOBIN: Yeah.

00:39:45.340 --> 00:39:46.720
We don't have an
answer for that one.

00:39:46.720 --> 00:39:47.219
Yeah.

00:39:47.219 --> 00:39:49.730
I mean, it has to start off
with an awful lot of humility.

00:39:49.730 --> 00:39:52.130
It has to start off with
an awful lot of listening.

00:39:52.130 --> 00:39:55.560
And it has to start off
with the presumption that

00:39:55.560 --> 00:39:59.740
doing it our way, which
we're a very thick culture.

00:39:59.740 --> 00:40:02.210
And we have very firm
understandings about the ways

00:40:02.210 --> 00:40:05.510
we like to do things.

00:40:05.510 --> 00:40:09.530
It requires a certain
flexibility in our approach.

00:40:09.530 --> 00:40:11.560
And knowing where
we think how we

00:40:11.560 --> 00:40:13.620
do something is very
important, and knowing

00:40:13.620 --> 00:40:16.050
how it's going to have to
adapt or change if it's

00:40:16.050 --> 00:40:18.530
going to be in a new place.

00:40:18.530 --> 00:40:21.820
It's been a lesson for
us to basically say

00:40:21.820 --> 00:40:27.020
if you can meet a certain
situation or culture part way

00:40:27.020 --> 00:40:31.220
and find an intersection of
expectations on their side

00:40:31.220 --> 00:40:34.040
and expectations on our
side, that's a toehold.

00:40:34.040 --> 00:40:35.940
And that toehold is
a wonderful thing.

00:40:35.940 --> 00:40:37.870
It may not be all
the way towards what

00:40:37.870 --> 00:40:39.230
we would hope and want.

00:40:39.230 --> 00:40:43.010
But you cannot recreate
San Francisco everywhere.

00:40:43.010 --> 00:40:45.530
A great concrete example is
we're doing work in China

00:40:45.530 --> 00:40:46.870
right now.

00:40:46.870 --> 00:40:51.360
And China has created some
of the largest and most

00:40:51.360 --> 00:40:55.070
magnificent museums and
Science Centers in the world.

00:40:55.070 --> 00:40:57.020
It's staggering
the scale and speed

00:40:57.020 --> 00:40:59.110
with which they built them.

00:40:59.110 --> 00:41:01.720
And now there is
dialogue about how

00:41:01.720 --> 00:41:03.960
you would create cultures
of innovation and cultures

00:41:03.960 --> 00:41:09.530
of learning and a sustainable
R&amp;D culture in China writ

00:41:09.530 --> 00:41:10.060
large.

00:41:10.060 --> 00:41:12.101
And as part of the Science
Center movement there,

00:41:12.101 --> 00:41:15.350
what would a second generation
of science centers look like?

00:41:15.350 --> 00:41:19.400
And the instinct will
be to go very quickly.

00:41:19.400 --> 00:41:21.070
How fast can you
build something?

00:41:21.070 --> 00:41:23.880
How can you have an immediate
transfer of knowledge such that

00:41:23.880 --> 00:41:25.850
were there?

00:41:25.850 --> 00:41:27.970
Done marvelous things
with that approach.

00:41:27.970 --> 00:41:29.490
But that's not our approach.

00:41:29.490 --> 00:41:31.350
We come in, and we
say, you realize

00:41:31.350 --> 00:41:33.560
this is going to take
a really long time.

00:41:33.560 --> 00:41:35.090
It's going to be messy.

00:41:35.090 --> 00:41:37.270
There will not be
immediately visible results.

00:41:37.270 --> 00:41:39.600
It's very longitudinal.

00:41:39.600 --> 00:41:41.990
So that can't be a reason
not to work together.

00:41:41.990 --> 00:41:45.220
And we can't come in thinking
the way we do it is right.

00:41:45.220 --> 00:41:47.369
And if you try and introduce
speed in the absolute

00:41:47.369 --> 00:41:49.410
or you try and introduce
scale on the absolutely,

00:41:49.410 --> 00:41:50.760
it can't work.

00:41:50.760 --> 00:41:53.400
We have to find a
way to say there's

00:41:53.400 --> 00:41:55.340
merit in working together.

00:41:55.340 --> 00:41:57.690
How do we find a
way at some scale

00:41:57.690 --> 00:42:02.010
to introduce what we do in a
way that can demonstrate impact

00:42:02.010 --> 00:42:04.160
faster?

00:42:04.160 --> 00:42:05.540
Just one example.

00:42:05.540 --> 00:42:10.440
But in the end, the truth is we
are just scratching the surface

00:42:10.440 --> 00:42:14.330
really of understanding
how, as an institution,

00:42:14.330 --> 00:42:15.575
we approach such questions.

00:42:18.205 --> 00:42:19.080
FEMALE SPEAKER: Cool.

00:42:19.080 --> 00:42:25.200
Any last message for tinkers and
makers and educators out there?

00:42:25.200 --> 00:42:27.780
ADAM TOBIN: Wow.

00:42:27.780 --> 00:42:30.340
I would just say that I think
it's an incredible time.

00:42:30.340 --> 00:42:33.650
I mean, anybody who's been a
participant the Maker Movement

00:42:33.650 --> 00:42:37.750
or education, whether
it's formal or informal,

00:42:37.750 --> 00:42:40.530
the resources that are out
there, the accessibility that

00:42:40.530 --> 00:42:42.590
exists, the ways
in which you can

00:42:42.590 --> 00:42:45.610
think in associative and
interesting ways, the fact

00:42:45.610 --> 00:42:47.900
that there are standards
changing from a government

00:42:47.900 --> 00:42:50.150
perspective, there's
ways in which countries

00:42:50.150 --> 00:42:53.200
can work together as
never before, it's just

00:42:53.200 --> 00:42:55.930
an extraordinary time.

00:42:55.930 --> 00:43:00.284
It's going to be fun to learn
over the next 10, 15, 20 years.

00:43:00.284 --> 00:43:01.700
