00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.410
- Have something in your life

00:00:01.410 --> 00:00:03.853
that's more important to you than acting.

00:00:04.854 --> 00:00:07.450
But something that's creative,

00:00:07.450 --> 00:00:10.880
something that gives you
a goal that's all yours

00:00:10.880 --> 00:00:12.560
and that doesn't depend on somebody

00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:14.830
calling you up and hiring you.

00:00:14.830 --> 00:00:17.494
So you're not sitting
around and waiting for that.

00:00:17.494 --> 00:00:21.990
You know, write, if
you want to play a role

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:23.580
produce it for yourself.

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:28.580
Try directing, lean tap
dancing, take voice lessons,

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:31.774
paint pictures, do
something that is creative.

00:00:31.774 --> 00:00:36.009
Give yourself a goal and
an aim and a project,

00:00:36.009 --> 00:00:39.570
chances are you'll never achieve it

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:43.883
and the reason will be
something will hire you to act.

00:00:43.883 --> 00:00:47.098
But in the meantime you've
got your creative juices,

00:00:47.098 --> 00:00:50.840
you're in charge of your own creative life

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:55.270
and I've followed exactly
that advice my entire career

00:00:55.270 --> 00:00:57.720
which is why I written children's books,

00:00:57.720 --> 00:01:00.250
and last week I performed with a bunch

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:04.480
of mad opera singers at the Carnegie Hall.

00:01:04.480 --> 00:01:08.630
I danced with the New York City ballet

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:11.093
in a ballet that I wrote myself.

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:17.270
You know, constantly, just make
like exciting for yourselves

00:01:18.751 --> 00:01:23.740
that does not depend on
other people's hiring you

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:27.823
because the hardest thing
to live with as an actor,

00:01:27.823 --> 00:01:29.370
the hardest thing to deal with

00:01:29.370 --> 00:01:34.019
is being rejected by people
you have contempt for.

00:01:34.019 --> 00:01:35.240
(audience laughing)

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:39.753
Find ways of avoiding
that, that's my advice.
