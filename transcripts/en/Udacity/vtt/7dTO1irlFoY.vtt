00:00:00.345 --> 00:00:03.370
Now, recall,
the concept of Epsilon Photography.

00:00:03.370 --> 00:00:05.160
Something by now,
you should be familiar with,

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:09.090
because you did an assignment of trying
to capture a sequence of pictures.

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:13.370
Epsilon Photography aims to capture
sequence of different pictures,

00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:17.500
where basically, we're changing one
parameter by just a minute amount.

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:21.950
Very small Epsilon amount to capture
the variations in a scene, and

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:24.810
then, of course, fuse the different
pictures together, to create

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:29.430
a richer representation that captures
a scene, and variety of conditions.

00:00:29.430 --> 00:00:34.120
And that could be used to synthesize
novel pictures, taking multiple captures

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:37.289
of the single scene, or the single
image to generate a newer image.

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:39.860
We looked at a variety of examples.

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:41.860
We can actually, change the exposure.

00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:46.090
If you recall, this was an example
of what we did to create HDR images.

00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:49.330
So, by fusing the three different
exposures of this image,

00:00:49.330 --> 00:00:51.770
we were able to generate an HDR image.

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:54.900
Another example could be,
the viewpoint, right?

00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:58.280
Where we change the camera parameters
by changing the viewpoint, and

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:01.240
then fusing them together,
we can create a panorama.

00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:03.250
Many other examples of this exist.

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:07.325
Here is an example of being able
to capture a focus stack, and

00:01:07.325 --> 00:01:12.495
then being able to generate a new image
that basically has no focus variations,

00:01:12.495 --> 00:01:16.385
or, of course, sometimes we can then
controllrably change the variation.

00:01:16.385 --> 00:01:19.605
But in Epsilon Photography,
the goal was to be able to capture

00:01:19.605 --> 00:01:23.985
all of those images, and in fact,
actually capture multiple images.

00:01:23.985 --> 00:01:27.630
Then those multiple images could be
then used to generate a newer image, or

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:31.350
perhaps, you want a controllable image
that could be generated on the fly.

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:34.872
Now, remember, part pipeline for
Computational Photography.

00:01:34.872 --> 00:01:38.100
We want to capture a 3D scene,
which is illuminated,

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:40.920
the optics focus a light onto a sensor.

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:45.520
We can process the images to generate
a new output display for a user.

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:49.150
If you recall this from our earlier
lectures, basically this was kind of

00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:54.140
showcased in the following manner,
we had a 3D scene, we can illuminate

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:59.170
the scene with the computer controlled
projector, a controllable light source.

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:03.420
And of course, we can control the light
source entirely, or also the parts of it

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:07.180
by creating some sort of,
a Modular Controllable Aperture.

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:09.900
Remember, again,
we have looked at this example

00:02:09.900 --> 00:02:13.750
in the previous lecture when we talked
about projector camera systems.

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:16.390
Another option, also was to
create a camera, and of course,

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:17.910
we would, knew how to do cameras.

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:21.823
We learned all there is to, about
the updates and the pinhole aspect of

00:02:21.823 --> 00:02:25.799
a camera, but we can also start thinking
that now I can put some sort of,

00:02:25.799 --> 00:02:28.186
a Controllable Aperture
in front of this,

00:02:28.186 --> 00:02:31.339
that not only controls the amount
of light that goes in.

00:02:31.339 --> 00:02:36.282
But also, which parts of the sensor
will be lit based on which parts I

00:02:36.282 --> 00:02:38.630
either restrict or open.

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:41.225
So, that's the basic pipeline
that we have looked at.

00:02:41.225 --> 00:02:43.290
We've looked up
projector camera systems.

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:46.740
We have looked at how illumination
source with a camera can be used to

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:49.000
extract, and
generate a newer types of images.

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:52.120
We have looked at the camera, but
we haven't actually looked at how

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:55.230
to control different aspects of it,
in this way, except,

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:58.320
in a few examples like the dual
photography example that we looked at.
