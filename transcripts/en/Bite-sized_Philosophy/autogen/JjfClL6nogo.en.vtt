00:00:00.900 --> 00:00:03.420
 this is the story of Peter Pan. 

00:00:03.420 --> 00:00:05.880
 Peter Pan is a magical boy. 

00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:10.040
 "Pan" means "God of all", approximately. 

00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:13.580
 and it is no coincidence that it is called "Pan". 

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:16.600
 and he is a boy who does not want to grow up and is magical. 

00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:18.540
 That's because children are magical. 

00:00:18.540 --> 00:00:21.800
 they can be anything. There is nothing but potential. 

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:25.620
 And Peter Pan doesn't want to lose it. Why? 

00:00:25.620 --> 00:00:27.860
 Well ... he's got a couple of adults around him, 

00:00:27.860 --> 00:00:30.140
 but the main adult is Captain Hook. 

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:32.640
 And who the hell wants to grow into Captain Hook? 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:34.160
 First ... you have a hook, 

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:36.480
 secondly, you are a tyrant, 

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:41.820
 and thirdly: you are being persecuted by a dragon of chaos with an alarm in your stomach. 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:45.040
 Crocodile ... already has your part. 

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:48.900
 Well ... that's what happens when you get older: time will have your part. 

00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:50.920
 Has a taste for you ... 

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:52.980
 and eventually devour you. 

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:58.100
 And so ... The hook is so traumatic that there can be nothing but a tyrant. 

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:01.360
 And then Peter Pan looks at the traumatized Hook 

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:04.500
 and says: No, I do not sacrifice my childhood for something like that. 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:09.300
 That's fine ... except that he ends up being the king of the lost boys in Nezemi Earth. 

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:12.980
 Well, it doesn't exist and who the hell wants to be the king of the lost boys? 

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:18.460
 And he also sacrifices the opportunity to have a real relationship with a woman - Wendy. 

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:23.900
 She's a rather conservative, middle-class girl from London. 

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:25.980
 He wants to grow up, have children and have a life. 

00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:29.540
 He accepts his mortality, accepts his maturity. 

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:33.020
 Peter Pan has to settle for the fairy Zvonilka 

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:35.740
 She doesn't even exist. She's kind of ... 

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:38.620
 She's something of a fairy pornography. 

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:40.580
 It does not exist. 

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:43.660
 She's a replacement for the real thing. 

00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:48.160
 But the dichotomy you're talking about is very tricky, 

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:51.240
 because sacrifice is part of adolescence. 

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:53.300
 You have to sacrifice 

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:56.800
 the pure potential of childhood 

00:01:56.800 --> 00:01:59.860
 in exchange for a real structure. 

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:02.080
 And why would you do that? 

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:05.160
 Well ... one reason may be: It will happen to you whether you do it or not. 

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:08.380
 Either you choose your damn restriction ... 

00:02:08.980 --> 00:02:12.280
 or you get caught off guard when you're 30. 

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:14.500
 Or - worse - when you're 40. 

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:17.820
 and then ... not a happy day. 

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:21.260
 I see such people and it seems to me more and more often in our culture, 

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:25.920
 because people can postpone their maturity without having to pay for it immediately. 

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:28.760
 but the "debt" will accumulate. 

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:31.560
 and when it comes to you, it will beat you, 

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:34.960
 because when you're 25, you can be an idiot, no problem. 

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:37.300
 even if you're looking for a job 

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:39.500
 you have no experience and you are pretty clueless ... 

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:42.040
 yeah, you're still young, no problem. 

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:44.540
 These are young people - they are full of potential. 

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:47.640
 Okay ... now you're the same person at age thirty. 

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:50.240
 People are not so excited about you at the moment. 

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:52.480
 What the hell have you been doing for the last 10 years? 

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:55.380
 Well ... I'm just as clueless as when I was 22. 

00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:57.920
 Yeah ... but you're not 22 anymore. 

00:02:57.920 --> 00:02:59.820
 You're an old child. 

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:03.180
 And that's an ugly thing ... old child. 

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:08.540
 a partial reason why you choose your damn victim ... 

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:12.020
 because the sacrifice is inevitable 

00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:13.480
 but at least you choose it. 

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:17.780
 and then there's something even more complicated in a sense ... 

00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:22.040
 The problem is, if you're a child, you're just a potential. 

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:26.240
 And very vague. You can be anything ... but you are nothing. 

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:30.820
 But you're going to learn something. 

00:03:30.820 --> 00:03:33.880
 and then at least you become something. 

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:37.500
 And when you are something, it reopens the world to you. 

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:40.460
 If you're a really good plumber, 

00:03:40.460 --> 00:03:44.080
 then you are much more than just a plumber. You will become a good employer ... 

00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:48.420
 I don't want to humiliate plumbers ... all the honor of plumbers. 

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:51.360
 They saved more lives than doctors. 

00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:53.340
 Hygiene. 

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:58.260
 If you are a really good plumber, you have employees, you run a business, 

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:01.560
 you teach other people, enrich their lives, 

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:04.680
 You are a community pillar, you have a family. 

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:09.520
 Once you get through this narrow learning period, 

00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:13.100
 which restricts and limits you while developing 

00:04:13.100 --> 00:04:17.880
 You can go to the other side with many new opportunities. 

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:20.680
 and Jung talked about it, he thought ... 

00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:25.380
 part of the good development in the second half of life 

00:04:25.380 --> 00:04:28.280
 is the rediscovery of the child 

00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:31.000
 you left when you were learning. 

00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:36.860
 So you are someone and you get the potential again. 

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:40.200
 Very, very clever ... Well, he was very, very smart. 

00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:42.300
 It's very wise. 

00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:43.740
 Very wise to know about it. 

00:04:47.540 --> 00:04:48.480
 Sacrifice. 

00:04:49.480 --> 00:04:51.760
 We'll also talk about that. 

00:04:51.760 --> 00:04:54.140
 You can choose your damn victim. 

00:04:54.140 --> 00:04:57.120
 That is all. You can't choose any. 

00:04:57.120 --> 00:05:00.160
 You sacrifice yourself, whether you like it or not. 

00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:02.200
 That's good to know. 

00:05:02.200 --> 00:05:03.780
 although ... 

00:05:03.780 --> 00:05:06.120
 it's hard to realize it. 

00:05:06.760 --> 00:05:08.180
 More questions? 

00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:18.420
 "I have one." 

00:05:18.700 --> 00:05:22.640
 "You've noticed that people are hanging out until they're 20 ..." 

00:05:23.300 --> 00:05:28.320
 "Where does it come from ... from the culture we live in?" 

00:05:28.320 --> 00:05:30.960
 I think universities are helping. 

00:05:31.620 --> 00:05:34.960
 Because you can go to university to be nothing. 

00:05:35.320 --> 00:05:38.500
 Instead of going to university to become someone. 

00:05:38.500 --> 00:05:40.440
 It's the Island of Pleasure. 

00:05:41.280 --> 00:05:44.780
 And the price you pay for it, especially in the States, is debt. 

00:05:45.340 --> 00:05:48.780
 And you're haunted because the university can rob you. 

00:05:49.320 --> 00:05:55.240
 So they rob your future self while allowing you to pretend you have an identity. 

00:05:55.960 --> 00:05:57.960
 Very ugly. 

00:05:57.960 --> 00:06:01.320
 And you can't report bankruptcy on your student loan in the United States. 

00:06:01.320 --> 00:06:02.780
 it is a contractual serfdom. 

00:06:03.420 --> 00:06:07.240
 And that's exactly Island of Pleasure ... exactly that. 

00:06:07.240 --> 00:06:10.220
 And tuition is extremely exorbitant. 

00:06:10.720 --> 00:06:14.120
 And a partial reason why universities do not put much pressure on students 

00:06:14.120 --> 00:06:17.320
 and let them do many things, 

00:06:17.320 --> 00:06:20.700
 basically ... why the hell would you drive them away? 

00:06:21.620 --> 00:06:24.260
 These are hundreds of thousands of dollars or more. 

00:06:24.920 --> 00:06:27.540
 So they can do what they want ... 

00:06:27.540 --> 00:06:30.420
 if you can sell them to salt mines. 

00:06:30.420 --> 00:06:31.420
 So. 

00:06:32.680 --> 00:06:36.340
 It's not the only reason, because the next thing is, 

00:06:36.340 --> 00:06:41.220
 the speed of technological change is now so great, and the amount of turnover ... 

00:06:41.220 --> 00:06:45.500
 It's really harder for people who are, say, 18-20 years old ... 

00:06:45.500 --> 00:06:47.740
 When I was a kid, more or less ... 

00:06:47.740 --> 00:06:53.240
 This difficult period of life was between 14 and 17 years. Somehow. 

00:06:53.240 --> 00:06:56.940
 Now I mean 18-25 years. Somehow. 

00:06:56.940 --> 00:06:59.260
 And I think the reason for this is ... 

00:06:59.260 --> 00:07:02.080
 that all the work that the damned hippies complained about 

00:07:02.080 --> 00:07:05.160
 that they were sentenced to them in the 1960s, disappeared. 

00:07:05.160 --> 00:07:09.120
 Their problem was: Oh God, I have to go to work for the corporation 

00:07:09.120 --> 00:07:11.460
 and get a salary for the rest of your life. 

00:07:11.460 --> 00:07:15.560
 And I will have a pension and it will be my whole life. 

00:07:15.560 --> 00:07:19.400
 It seems to me that this is a much better offer than ... 

00:07:19.400 --> 00:07:23.360
 an endless series of part-time jobs at Starbucks. 

00:07:23.360 --> 00:07:26.260
 So ... partly it is 

00:07:26.960 --> 00:07:31.760
 Now we have space in our culture 

00:07:31.760 --> 00:07:38.280
 missing people who change from children to adults. 

00:07:39.260 --> 00:07:41.940
 And the price we pay for it is postponed later. 

00:07:42.200 --> 00:07:46.000
 And that's not a good thing ... it's not a good thing.
