00:00:12.565 --> 00:00:14.914
There is a pastor in Baltimore.

00:00:14.938 --> 00:00:16.675
His name is Michael Phillips,

00:00:16.699 --> 00:00:18.794
he is the pastor of Kingdom Life Church,

00:00:18.818 --> 00:00:23.961
and he often talks about how problems
show up in our lives so arrogantly,

00:00:23.985 --> 00:00:28.108
with so much confidence, as if there is
just nothing we can do about them.

00:00:28.132 --> 00:00:30.609
And the murder rate in Baltimore
had been doing that.

00:00:30.633 --> 00:00:34.715
Year after year, it just
kept showing up as this big thing

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:37.860
that there was nothing any of us
could do anything about.

00:00:37.884 --> 00:00:40.106
But the thing about Baltimore

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:43.138
is that it has never been the one
to just be defeated.

00:00:43.982 --> 00:00:46.692
So the story about the Baltimore Ceasefire

00:00:46.716 --> 00:00:50.151
is that Baltimore looked
the murder rate in the eye

00:00:50.175 --> 00:00:54.181
and said, "What you're not going to do
is snatch our greatness."

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:58.641
So two years ago,
I'm at a 300 Man March meeting.

00:00:58.665 --> 00:01:00.762
At the time, I was a leader
in that movement.

00:01:00.786 --> 00:01:02.385
And this guy named Ogun --

00:01:02.409 --> 00:01:04.794
he's like a godfather
of hip-hop in Baltimore --

00:01:04.818 --> 00:01:06.386
he came over to me and he said,

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:09.921
"Yo, I have this idea about
calling a ceasefire in Baltimore,

00:01:09.945 --> 00:01:12.888
and I feel like you are somebody
I should talk to about that."

00:01:12.912 --> 00:01:16.246
And I was like, "I'm absolutely
somebody you should talk to about that,

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:18.128
because that's something we should do."

00:01:18.152 --> 00:01:20.197
And so we played phone tag
and meeting tag,

00:01:20.221 --> 00:01:24.527
and two years went by and we never
really sat down and talked about it.

00:01:24.551 --> 00:01:27.402
So now we're in May of 2017.

00:01:27.426 --> 00:01:31.377
My son Paul, he's 19 years old,
he's driving me home from work one day,

00:01:31.401 --> 00:01:34.402
and he says, "Ma, did you know
that the murder rate in Baltimore

00:01:34.426 --> 00:01:35.982
is higher than it's ever been?"

00:01:36.006 --> 00:01:38.951
And I said, "What you mean
it's higher than it's ever been?

00:01:38.975 --> 00:01:40.356
How is that possible?

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:44.001
Like, I mean, what about people who say
they have connections to the streets?

00:01:44.025 --> 00:01:47.507
Why won't they use those connections
and call a cease-fire or something?"

00:01:47.531 --> 00:01:48.773
And on and on I went

00:01:48.797 --> 00:01:53.237
from my own feelings of helplessness
about what other people weren't doing.

00:01:53.261 --> 00:01:55.019
The next morning I woke up

00:01:55.043 --> 00:01:57.409
and I realized that what I was
really angry about

00:01:57.433 --> 00:02:00.265
wasn't about what other people
weren't doing,

00:02:00.289 --> 00:02:03.075
it was that I had heard
this message years ago,

00:02:03.099 --> 00:02:04.472
and I hadn't moved on it.

00:02:04.496 --> 00:02:07.273
So it was about what I
was supposed to be doing.

00:02:07.297 --> 00:02:09.336
So I got up and I'm going,

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:11.474
"OK, if we could
just have three days

00:02:11.498 --> 00:02:14.140
where everybody in the city
was committing,

00:02:14.164 --> 00:02:16.979
nobody is going to kill anybody,

00:02:17.003 --> 00:02:19.435
and we're going to celebrate life instead,

00:02:19.459 --> 00:02:20.610
when can we do that?"

00:02:20.634 --> 00:02:22.365
So it's May, I look at my calendar,

00:02:22.389 --> 00:02:26.304
all right, I've got some free time
the first weekend in August,

00:02:26.328 --> 00:02:29.947
we'll do it August 4th
through August 6th, right?

00:02:29.971 --> 00:02:32.873
So I'm all excited,
I start driving to work,

00:02:32.897 --> 00:02:35.304
and the more I drive, the scareder I get.

00:02:36.685 --> 00:02:39.669
And so I start going, "Never mind ...

00:02:39.693 --> 00:02:40.694
(Laughter)

00:02:40.718 --> 00:02:42.296
I won't say this thing out loud.

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:45.141
Nobody will ever know
I was thinking it if I don't say it."

00:02:45.165 --> 00:02:47.325
But it wouldn't let me go,

00:02:47.349 --> 00:02:51.022
because God loves to show up as us,

00:02:51.046 --> 00:02:52.689
and because I look broken

00:02:52.713 --> 00:02:55.308
and I'm always called
to stand in my wholeness,

00:02:55.332 --> 00:02:58.174
there was a call on my life
to say this thing out loud.

00:02:58.198 --> 00:03:00.356
And because my city looks broken

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:03.420
and is always yearning
to show up in its wholeness,

00:03:03.444 --> 00:03:07.254
there were hearts that morning
calling all through my chest

00:03:07.278 --> 00:03:10.786
that people around this city
wanted to do something great together.

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:14.414
And people who had already
been killed in my city

00:03:14.438 --> 00:03:16.111
were calling to me

00:03:16.135 --> 00:03:18.683
up through my gut and my chest,

00:03:18.707 --> 00:03:23.803
as a knot in my throat, "Yo, E,
you cannot just let us be dead in vain

00:03:23.827 --> 00:03:26.134
when you know how to say
this thing out loud."

00:03:26.158 --> 00:03:28.871
And I responded to them with my fear.

00:03:28.895 --> 00:03:31.571
"But somebody might get killed
anyway that weekend."

00:03:31.595 --> 00:03:33.764
And that was the moment
where I had to accept

00:03:33.788 --> 00:03:36.638
that maybe while we're out
spreading this message --

00:03:36.662 --> 00:03:40.052
"Hey, nobody's going to kill anybody.
We're going to celebrate life!" --

00:03:40.076 --> 00:03:43.418
maybe somebody will be plotting
to take a life right then and there,

00:03:43.442 --> 00:03:47.508
but now they would have
a rumbling in their spirit.

00:03:47.532 --> 00:03:50.050
And so I knew it was time for my city

00:03:50.074 --> 00:03:53.669
to have a collective
rumbling in our spirit.

00:03:53.693 --> 00:03:56.486
So I got on the phone, got around to Ogun,

00:03:56.510 --> 00:03:59.150
and I said, "Yo, you said
you wanted to do a cease-fire?

00:03:59.174 --> 00:04:00.340
What is it? I'm ready."

00:04:00.364 --> 00:04:04.572
So he said, "You know, when I hear about
the Israelis and Palestinians at war,

00:04:04.596 --> 00:04:06.835
I'm like, that's too bad,
they should stop that,

00:04:06.859 --> 00:04:08.688
but when I hear the word 'cease-fire,'

00:04:08.712 --> 00:04:12.086
that makes me pause and stop
and really research what's going on."

00:04:12.110 --> 00:04:15.065
And he wanted Baltimore
to get that same kind of attention

00:04:15.089 --> 00:04:16.269
from the outside,

00:04:16.293 --> 00:04:20.122
but introspection from the inside
about what was going on with us.

00:04:20.146 --> 00:04:23.154
And we talked about how it couldn't
belong to one person.

00:04:23.178 --> 00:04:26.597
Not one person or one organization
should call a cease-fire.

00:04:26.621 --> 00:04:30.148
The whole city had to own it
and do it together.

00:04:30.172 --> 00:04:32.098
So we had our first meeting in May.

00:04:32.122 --> 00:04:34.676
About 12 or 15 people show up,

00:04:34.700 --> 00:04:37.849
and this is where it gets named
the Baltimore Ceasefire,

00:04:37.873 --> 00:04:41.164
because you know what that means
when you hear the word "cease-fire."

00:04:41.188 --> 00:04:42.523
Just don't kill nobody.

00:04:42.547 --> 00:04:46.192
And this is where the Baltimore
Peace Challenge was born.

00:04:46.216 --> 00:04:48.889
Because it's not just about
not being violent.

00:04:48.913 --> 00:04:52.142
It is about being purposefully peaceful.

00:04:52.166 --> 00:04:54.018
What is going on in your thoughts?

00:04:54.042 --> 00:04:57.162
What kind of petty things
are you not saying out of your mouth?

00:04:57.186 --> 00:05:00.725
How are you responding
in your behaviors to conflict?

00:05:00.749 --> 00:05:03.265
I grabbed up five people who I trusted,

00:05:03.289 --> 00:05:06.387
and the six of us became
the organizing squad.

00:05:06.411 --> 00:05:08.136
So let's give them props real quick.

00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:10.997
On the count of three,
I want you to yell "squad."

00:05:11.021 --> 00:05:13.012
One, two, three: squad! Audience: Squad!

00:05:13.116 --> 00:05:15.693
And it's Shellers's birthday.
Happy birthday, Shellers.

00:05:15.727 --> 00:05:16.997
Audience: Happy birthday!

00:05:17.021 --> 00:05:19.331
And so we put out a press release,

00:05:19.355 --> 00:05:22.125
and the media told us,
this is not really a story yet,

00:05:22.149 --> 00:05:25.506
we will get with you on August 7th
to see how the cease-fire went.

00:05:25.530 --> 00:05:28.146
So we went, "Oh, word?
Oh, all right then."

00:05:28.170 --> 00:05:29.484
And Baltimore got to work,

00:05:29.508 --> 00:05:32.825
and not only did people send money
to the PayPal account

00:05:32.849 --> 00:05:35.102
so we could buy flyers and posters,

00:05:35.126 --> 00:05:37.730
people came and got the flyers and posters

00:05:37.754 --> 00:05:39.849
and they put them all around the city,

00:05:39.873 --> 00:05:42.454
and people were having
conversations with each other.

00:05:42.478 --> 00:05:45.914
What kind of resources do you need?
What are you going through?

00:05:45.938 --> 00:05:47.159
What has happened to you?

00:05:47.183 --> 00:05:51.389
Because we understand the root causes
of violence in this country.

00:05:51.413 --> 00:05:54.191
People who said it wouldn't work
still ended their sentence

00:05:54.215 --> 00:05:57.993
with "but please keep trying.
Somebody needs to do something anyway."

00:05:58.017 --> 00:05:59.708
Teenagers who would tell us

00:05:59.732 --> 00:06:02.807
about the stuff they were doing
in the streets all day asked,

00:06:02.831 --> 00:06:05.726
"But can I have a poster
to put it on my wall at night

00:06:05.750 --> 00:06:08.116
so I can see it on my way to bed?"

00:06:08.140 --> 00:06:09.712
Gangsters were calling, saying,

00:06:09.736 --> 00:06:12.641
"I can tell you where
violence is not going to come from,

00:06:12.665 --> 00:06:15.041
because we're committing
to the Peace Challenge."

00:06:15.065 --> 00:06:16.316
And they kept their word.

00:06:16.340 --> 00:06:18.340
When people said, "It's not going to work,

00:06:18.364 --> 00:06:21.046
because somebody's going to kill
over West or over East,"

00:06:21.070 --> 00:06:24.637
we said, "That doesn't matter.
It's about self-determination, yo.

00:06:24.661 --> 00:06:28.083
You telling me you can't keep
this three- or six-block radius safe?"

00:06:28.107 --> 00:06:30.108
And they would say, "Don't get it twisted.

00:06:30.132 --> 00:06:33.695
It's going to stay safe around here."
And they kept their promise.

00:06:33.719 --> 00:06:40.719
(Applause)

00:06:41.031 --> 00:06:42.485
Four songs --

00:06:42.509 --> 00:06:45.048
and I know it looks like
I'm holding up five fingers,

00:06:45.072 --> 00:06:47.477
but I have four fingers,
so this is four for me --

00:06:47.501 --> 00:06:50.186
four songs got made
about the Baltimore Ceasefire,

00:06:50.210 --> 00:06:52.988
and the one that most exemplifies it,

00:06:53.012 --> 00:06:55.806
where a bunch of artists
came together and made a song,

00:06:55.830 --> 00:07:00.118
that one is currently nominated
for a Grammy out here. Right?

00:07:00.142 --> 00:07:02.777
And so now what was happening

00:07:02.801 --> 00:07:05.814
was from the most beautiful
corners of crack houses

00:07:05.838 --> 00:07:09.257
to the grimiest corners
of politicians' offices,

00:07:09.281 --> 00:07:10.470
everybody --

00:07:10.494 --> 00:07:12.106
(Laughter)

00:07:12.130 --> 00:07:16.119
was talking about this thing
Baltimore was doing together. Right?

00:07:16.762 --> 00:07:18.336
And then, the weekend came:

00:07:19.440 --> 00:07:22.806
events all over the city,
people yelling "Happy Ceasefire Day!"

00:07:22.830 --> 00:07:25.987
Over 200 people got their records
expunged and got jobs,

00:07:26.011 --> 00:07:28.686
and people went
into drug recovery programs

00:07:28.710 --> 00:07:31.845
because of what was happening
in our city that weekend.

00:07:31.869 --> 00:07:34.836
People were going, "But the air
feels different in Baltimore.

00:07:34.860 --> 00:07:37.062
Nobody's mother
got that phone call last night.

00:07:37.086 --> 00:07:38.491
I didn't hear any gunshots."

00:07:38.515 --> 00:07:41.586
And on Saturday, Trey went to go get a job

00:07:41.610 --> 00:07:42.915
and was excited about it.

00:07:42.939 --> 00:07:45.029
At 24 hours of no killing,

00:07:45.053 --> 00:07:50.364
we were singing Kendrick Lamar.
"We gon' be alright. We gon' be alright."

00:07:50.388 --> 00:07:53.237
And then at 4:59 on Saturday,

00:07:53.261 --> 00:07:55.282
we get a message that somebody was killed.

00:07:55.306 --> 00:07:58.242
We didn't know his name,
but it turned out to be Trey.

00:08:00.988 --> 00:08:03.083
So we rushed over to Sargeant Street,

00:08:04.181 --> 00:08:06.409
and we held hands in a circle

00:08:06.433 --> 00:08:08.096
and we looked at the pavement,

00:08:08.120 --> 00:08:12.214
and we said, "This is sacred ground
because we make it so,

00:08:12.238 --> 00:08:16.106
because everywhere in our city
where people lose their lives to violence

00:08:16.130 --> 00:08:18.175
needs to be sacred ground."

00:08:18.199 --> 00:08:22.466
And it wasn't just about
upholding Trey and his transition

00:08:22.490 --> 00:08:25.046
and sending love to his family.

00:08:25.070 --> 00:08:29.533
It was about us pausing to really
think about what must it feel like

00:08:29.557 --> 00:08:32.650
20 minutes after you kill somebody?

00:08:32.674 --> 00:08:35.092
Can't we pour love into that?

00:08:35.116 --> 00:08:39.083
Because until we do,
we will not heal this epidemic.

00:08:39.107 --> 00:08:42.257
Later on in the day, we get another call.

00:08:42.937 --> 00:08:44.581
Dante is murdered.

00:08:44.605 --> 00:08:47.137
So by the end of this day, we were shook.

00:08:47.898 --> 00:08:49.769
In real life, we were shook,

00:08:49.793 --> 00:08:52.263
because we had opened up
our hearts together

00:08:52.287 --> 00:08:54.193
and changed the atmosphere of this city,

00:08:54.217 --> 00:08:56.899
and now our hearts were broken together.

00:08:56.923 --> 00:09:00.257
And we had to be honest
about the fact that last weekend,

00:09:00.281 --> 00:09:02.502
when we lost six people to violence,

00:09:02.526 --> 00:09:06.203
it didn't feel the way it felt
this weekend when we lost these two,

00:09:06.227 --> 00:09:09.352
because now we were paying attention.

00:09:09.376 --> 00:09:11.750
Now we were all hoping together

00:09:11.774 --> 00:09:13.738
that nobody got killed.

00:09:13.762 --> 00:09:17.059
And so we had to make a vow with ourselves

00:09:17.083 --> 00:09:21.837
not to be numb anymore
when we lose people in our city.

00:09:21.861 --> 00:09:27.701
These two lives were going to remind us
to vibrate higher and to move forward.

00:09:27.725 --> 00:09:32.180
So as we move forward
into Baltimore Ceasefire 365,

00:09:32.204 --> 00:09:34.665
because there's work that needs
to be done all year,

00:09:34.689 --> 00:09:37.347
and there's another cease-fire
happening next weekend,

00:09:37.371 --> 00:09:40.379
November 3rd through 5th.
Mark your calendar.

00:09:40.403 --> 00:09:41.404
(Applause)

00:09:41.428 --> 00:09:43.467
Right? And we expect the same thing.

00:09:43.491 --> 00:09:45.630
It was news media
from all around the world,

00:09:45.654 --> 00:09:47.335
Australia and Norway and China.

00:09:47.359 --> 00:09:49.884
Everybody wanted to come
get this work from Baltimore,

00:09:49.908 --> 00:09:52.174
and y'all could come get it. Right?

00:09:52.198 --> 00:09:55.322
So as we push forward,
we don't need to keep asking now

00:09:55.346 --> 00:09:56.497
"What can we do?"

00:09:56.521 --> 00:10:00.005
We have seen the power
of collective consciousness.

00:10:00.029 --> 00:10:02.762
Y'all were the ones
who misunderstood Baltimore.

00:10:02.786 --> 00:10:05.739
Y'all thought Baltimore
was just "The Wire."

00:10:05.763 --> 00:10:07.541
When we lost Freddie Gray,

00:10:07.565 --> 00:10:09.550
y'all saw the Baltimore uprising,

00:10:09.574 --> 00:10:13.865
and people around this world
mischaracterized it and misunderstood it.

00:10:13.889 --> 00:10:19.517
What you failed to realize
is Baltimore is the power to rise up,

00:10:19.541 --> 00:10:21.825
and that is what we continue to do.

00:10:21.849 --> 00:10:22.942
(Applause)

00:10:22.966 --> 00:10:26.474
And so as we move forward,
we see you, America,

00:10:26.498 --> 00:10:30.903
with your systems of violent oppression
trying to beat us into the ground,

00:10:30.927 --> 00:10:33.030
and still, we rise.

00:10:33.054 --> 00:10:37.801
We rise and stand with cities
all over this country just like us

00:10:37.825 --> 00:10:40.420
who are handed,
through no fault of their own,

00:10:40.444 --> 00:10:42.833
criminal conditions in which to live,

00:10:42.857 --> 00:10:46.921
and then they get labeled savages
for how they live.

00:10:46.945 --> 00:10:48.929
We stand with them.

00:10:48.953 --> 00:10:52.963
We remind them we are an example
of what you can do when you say,

00:10:52.987 --> 00:10:56.059
"No, I don't have to accept
these conditions

00:10:56.083 --> 00:10:57.588
that you are trying to hand me.

00:10:57.612 --> 00:11:02.033
I get to decide what the greatest
vision of myself looks like.

00:11:02.956 --> 00:11:05.659
And so the next time

00:11:05.683 --> 00:11:09.021
you are faced with a dilemma,
with a problem,

00:11:09.045 --> 00:11:12.572
you can say, "Let me be like Baltimore,

00:11:12.596 --> 00:11:15.036
let me look it in the face,

00:11:15.060 --> 00:11:16.530
let me tell it."

00:11:16.554 --> 00:11:20.236
But what you're not going to do
is snatch my greatness.

00:11:20.260 --> 00:11:21.644
Please believe it.

00:11:22.141 --> 00:11:23.292
Thank you.

00:11:23.316 --> 00:11:26.046
(Applause)
