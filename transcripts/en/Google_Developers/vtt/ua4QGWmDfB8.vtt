[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:04.687 --> 00:00:05.270
IDO GREEN: Hi.

00:00:05.270 --> 00:00:08.830
I'm Ido Green, a developer
advocate for Actions on Google.

00:00:08.830 --> 00:00:11.040
We wondered what would
be the most helpful to

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:14.660
developers creating apps
for their Google Assistant.

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:16.877
Would you want a T-shirt?

00:00:16.877 --> 00:00:17.460
AUDIENCE: Ooh.

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:18.050
IDO GREEN: Maybe.

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:18.695
Access to Google engineers?

00:00:18.695 --> 00:00:19.370
AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:22.787
IDO GREEN: Definitely. $200
monthly Google Cloud credit?

00:00:22.787 --> 00:00:23.370
AUDIENCE: Yay.

00:00:23.370 --> 00:00:24.328
IDO GREEN: Yes, please.

00:00:24.328 --> 00:00:25.775
AUDIENCE: I want a T-shirt.

00:00:25.775 --> 00:00:28.820
IDO GREEN: We've created a new
Developer Community Program

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:30.590
to support your
efforts in building

00:00:30.590 --> 00:00:32.600
great apps for the
Google Assistant

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:34.520
and to celebrate
your accomplishments.

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:36.620
Making your first app
for the Google Assistant

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:40.230
available to users is definitely
something worth celebrating.

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:43.130
So we're going to give you $200
monthly Google Cloud credit.

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:45.200
AUDIENCE: How about a T-shirt?

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:46.010
IDO GREEN: OK.

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:49.070
We'll also give you a T-shirt.

00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:50.830
AUDIENCE: Yay!

00:00:50.830 --> 00:00:53.660
IDO GREEN: Make sure to wear
it when you meet our team

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:55.930
at events around the world.

00:00:55.930 --> 00:00:59.170
Ready to get started but
don't know what to build yet?

00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:01.450
We have a few good options.

00:01:01.450 --> 00:01:04.030
You can discover great apps by
browsing the Google Assistant

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:05.360
directory.

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:09.550
You could also check our docs
and log to the Action console

00:01:09.550 --> 00:01:10.810
to start building.

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:13.030
Or use one of our
existing templates

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:16.630
to finish your app in no
time and without any code.

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:19.210
Links to all those
resources and videos

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:22.360
about using Actions templates
can be found in the description

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:24.210
below.

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:27.990
Now, launching your first app
to users is half the battle.

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:30.300
We want to reward you
for all your hard work

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:33.000
and support those of you
who put in the extra effort

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.760
to build high-quality apps
that are getting traction

00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:38.010
from users globally.

00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:40.320
For every developer,
friends and family

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:42.600
are the first
users of their app.

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:44.760
To reach the next
milestone and gain traction

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:47.310
among global users,
you need to be

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:51.000
noticed by a community outside
your close group of friends--

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:55.260
or simply have incredibly
large social circle.

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:57.540
Getting users to try
your app is great.

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:00.510
Getting them to come back
again and again is even better.

00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:02.430
If you build a
quality experience

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:05.250
that users can't
get enough of, we

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:07.020
want to contribute
to your efforts

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:10.060
to improve and grow your app.

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:12.980
As Actions on Google
continues to grow and roll out

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:15.310
to new countries, we'd
like the Google Assistant

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:19.090
users to enjoy great quality
apps in their native language.

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:22.300
If you make your app available
in two languages, one of which

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:25.870
should be a non-English variant,
and a minimum amount of users

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:27.910
engage with it in
both languages,

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:30.010
we'll help you on
your journey to build

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:32.630
a global community of users.

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:35.560
If at least one of your apps
reaches one of these three

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:38.920
milestones, we'll invite you
to join our community program

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:40.240
Google group.

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:43.840
There, we send an exclusive,
[? group-members-only ?] invite

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:46.030
to meet and talk
with Google experts--

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:48.550
either through Hangouts
or at the small VIP

00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:50.930
events around the world.

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:52.690
We'll also ship
you a Google Home

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:55.559
to make it easier for you
to test and use your app.

00:02:55.559 --> 00:02:57.100
You have a chance
to be on the ground

00:02:57.100 --> 00:02:59.350
floor of a booming
community that's

00:02:59.350 --> 00:03:02.350
working on the cutting edge of
the Google Assistant platform.

00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:03.610
What more do you want?

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:06.354
AUDIENCE: Do you
have more T-shirts?

00:03:06.354 --> 00:03:08.020
IDO GREEN: Visit the
YouTube description

00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:10.540
below for more
information, including

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:13.920
links to our blog post about
the Developer Community Program.

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:16.469
Until next time, be wise
and create amazing apps

00:03:16.469 --> 00:03:17.510
for the Google Assistant.

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:20.560
