00:00:00.580 --> 00:00:02.710
So we just covered the first constraint, which is

00:00:02.710 --> 00:00:06.090
find that data and battery life. Now as developers,

00:00:06.090 --> 00:00:07.930
it's, I mean it's, it's easy for us to

00:00:07.930 --> 00:00:10.630
know that these constraints are very important not to violate.

00:00:10.630 --> 00:00:11.140
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:00:11.140 --> 00:00:12.940
&gt;&gt; But once you actually talk to a user

00:00:12.940 --> 00:00:15.980
that's feeling the pain. From when these constraints have

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:18.170
been violated, that really sheds a light on how

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:20.950
truly important this is. We cannot overstate this fact.

00:00:20.950 --> 00:00:22.890
&gt;&gt; So we talked to an actual Android user about

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:25.400
her experiences with her phone. Let's hear what she says.
