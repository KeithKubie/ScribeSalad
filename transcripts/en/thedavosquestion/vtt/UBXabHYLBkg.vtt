&gt;&gt; Hi, YouTube.

00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:05.730
This is Meghan Asha and, umm, I'm answering
the Davos question today.

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:10.700
I think that the No. 1 thing that we should
focus on for 2008 is, umm,

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:15.030
trying to get countries together to focus
on the global climate

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:18.440
change.
Umm, global warming is a huge, huge probable

00:00:18.440 --> 00:00:22.859
right now and, umm, I
think that we can start by obviously doing

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:26.039
personal actions but the
biggest thing is to actually pass laws for

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:33.390
CO2 emission.
So, umm, that's what I think it is.
