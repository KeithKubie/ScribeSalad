00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.140
PHIL: One person is going to
win, and they can choose to

00:00:02.140 --> 00:00:03.840
bring along somebody
of their choice.

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:38.914
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:38.914 --> 00:00:43.140
NARRATOR: Last time in 5.301,
the students just practiced

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:44.680
re-crystallization.

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:46.510
Now it's time for
the real thing.

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:50.430
PROFESSOR: You're actually going
to take your crystals,

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:53.910
and you're going to
re-crystallize them, to

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:57.420
produce one big crystal.

00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:58.820
And there's a prize.

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:05.010
Whoever gets this first is
going to lunch with me at

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:09.430
Legal Sea Foods, and you can
bring one of your friends, and

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:11.260
you can invite the TAs.

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:15.170
NARRATOR: The goal is to grow
a single, perfect, crystal.

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:18.920
But first, the students have to
actually make the compound

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:21.300
they're going to grow
their crystals from,

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:24.320
this chromium complex.

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:27.325
This is their first real
reaction in the lab.

00:01:30.555 --> 00:01:33.160
ANTHONY: It's a different
color and that's usually

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:34.585
pretty good in chemistry.

00:01:34.585 --> 00:01:37.740
NARRATOR: After they filter,
wash, and dry their product,

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:41.350
the students begin testing
solvents, and some start

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:42.160
teaming up.

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:45.542
PHIL: I actually saw an alliance
forming over here.

00:01:45.542 --> 00:01:47.290
YI-SHIUAN: I saw some
of them split up

00:01:47.290 --> 00:01:48.705
trying different solvents.

00:01:48.705 --> 00:01:52.390
We actually worked on find
the solvents together.

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:56.470
JULIE: We decided to use
dichloromethane and hexane for

00:01:56.470 --> 00:01:57.330
our solvents.

00:01:57.330 --> 00:02:01.672
ANTHONY: We're going to use
hexanes and methanol.

00:02:01.672 --> 00:02:01.758
Shh.

00:02:01.758 --> 00:02:04.590
We're going to win.

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:06.400
NARRATOR: Hansol seems
pretty driven.

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:09.530
HANSOL: I like competition.

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:11.130
I want to win, obviously.

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:14.266
NARRATOR: If you win, who will
you invite to lunch?

00:02:14.266 --> 00:02:17.580
HANSOL: I would probably
pick Dan.

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:18.795
I made a deal with
him earlier.

00:02:18.795 --> 00:02:21.580
NARRATOR: So, Hansol's been
working with Dan.

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:22.585
What about you, Emily?

00:02:22.585 --> 00:02:25.840
EMILY: Yeah, I worked with Dan
to figure out what solvent

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:27.366
system would work well.

00:02:27.366 --> 00:02:29.290
NARRATOR: Uh, OK.

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:30.435
Let's recap.

00:02:30.435 --> 00:02:31.200
HANSOL: Dan.

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:31.860
EMILY: Dan.

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:32.560
HANSOL: Dan.

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:33.195
EMILY: Dan

00:02:33.195 --> 00:02:33.970
HANSOL: Dan.

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:34.580
EMILY: Dan.

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:36.100
NARRATOR: Dan, what do you
have to say for yourself?

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:38.870
DAN: It was a loosely
formed alliance, we

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:40.410
didn't sign any papers.

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:43.820
NARRATOR: Ike meanwhile
has a different idea.

00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:45.420
IKE: I'm broke.

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:49.100
If I get the ticket I'm going
to sell it for money.

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:53.200
Because I know, these suckers
want it really bad.

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:54.880
PHIL: We have some people whose

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:56.390
samples look pretty good.

00:02:56.390 --> 00:03:00.620
They seem to be wanting to try
a lot of different solvent

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:03.250
systems, a lot of different
temperatures.

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:04.600
They're asking a lot
of questions.

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:06.710
They want to make sure that
everything is perfect.

00:03:06.710 --> 00:03:09.900
Because I think everyone wants
to get the biggest crystal.

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:11.330
They're very determined.

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:12.690
They're going for
all or nothing.

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:15.310
They don't want a bunch
of small crystals.

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:18.080
LINA: Next week, we're going
to win the biggest crystal

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:19.150
competition.

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:20.955
Because the winners get to take
the TAs and Professor

00:03:20.955 --> 00:03:23.130
Dolhun out to lunch.

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:24.785
JULIE: Legal Sea Foods,
for free.

00:03:24.785 --> 00:03:26.380
NARRATOR: So that's it.

00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:28.130
Everything's set and everyone's

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:30.080
excited about the prize.

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:32.000
But, who will win?

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:35.520
Find out next time on 5.301.

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:39.714
JULIE: Yeah, we're done.

00:03:39.714 --> 00:03:41.816
PHIL: I'm having this
re-occurring dream.

00:03:41.816 --> 00:03:44.790
It's like I'm jogging through
a park with a

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:45.320
fitness boot camp.

00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:47.950
And I stop to talk
to Kris Jenner.

00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:50.857
And I always say, no, no,
no, Kris, I can't talk

00:03:50.857 --> 00:03:52.770
to you right now.

00:03:52.770 --> 00:03:55.590
And she pours Kool-Aid on me.

00:03:55.590 --> 00:03:58.360
And I wake up drenched
in Kool-Aid.

00:03:58.360 --> 00:03:59.020
That's a dream.

00:03:59.020 --> 00:04:02.350
If it was Bruce Jenner pouring
Kool-Aid on me, that would be

00:04:02.350 --> 00:04:02.650
a nightmare.

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:09.259
