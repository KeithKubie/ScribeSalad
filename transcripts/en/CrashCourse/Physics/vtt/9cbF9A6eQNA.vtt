00:00:03.080 --> 00:00:06.019
The physics we’re going to talk about today
has SAVED your life.

00:00:06.020 --> 00:00:08.980
Whenever you step into a building, or walk
across a bridge --

00:00:08.980 --> 00:00:13.980
THIS is the science that keeps the building STANDING, the bridge STABLE, and you ALIVE.

00:00:13.990 --> 00:00:18.230
It’s STATICS -- the study of how objects
behave, when they are NOT accelerating.

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:21.980
Whether that means they’re standing completely still, or moving at a CONSTANT velocity.

00:00:21.989 --> 00:00:25.520
Statics can tell you a lot about the way things
behave, when you’re trying to balance them,

00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:27.880
or when they’re being COMPRESSED or STRETCHED.

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:32.460
So engineers use statics for things like...figuring
out where a building’s supports should go,

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:35.840
and how MANY of them there should be...Or
what type of bridge design would work BEST

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:37.160
to cross that river in town.

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:40.400
You can use it, too -- say...the next time
you climb a ladder.

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:45.680
If you do, you’ll find that, even though an object may not be moving, there are still, all kinds of things affecting it.

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:47.860
Like stress, and strain
and pressure.

00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:50.840
So who knows? Today’s episode may someday,
save your life!

00:00:50.850 --> 00:01:03.200
[Theme Music]

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:08.139
Objects that aren’t accelerating are said
to be in EQUILIBRIUM, a concept that we’ve touched on before.

00:01:08.139 --> 00:01:12.239
It means that there can be forces ON an
object, but there can’t be NET forces on it.

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:15.740
Otherwise, that net force m, would make
the object accelerate.

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:20.619
Torque affects equilibrium too, since an object
in equilibrium, can’t have rotational acceleration, either.

00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:25.260
So again, there can be torques on an object in equilibrium, but there can’t be NET torques on it.

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:28.340
In other words, the net torques must be equal to zero.

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:33.860
All of this means that for an object to be in equilibrium, all the forces AND torques on it have to balance out.

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:39.020
A classic example of forces and torques cancelling
each other out, is a ladder leaning against a wall.

00:01:39.029 --> 00:01:42.639
The ladder isn’t accelerating -- or even
moving -- so it must be in equilibrium.

00:01:42.639 --> 00:01:46.099
But, how much force is there on the ladder,
from both the wall and the floor?

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:47.499
That's pretty easy to figure out!

00:01:47.499 --> 00:01:51.069
Let’s say we know that the bottom of the
ladder is 3m from the wall, the top of the

00:01:51.069 --> 00:01:57.539
ladder is 4m from the floor, the ladder itself
is 5m long, and it has a mass of 10kg.

00:01:57.539 --> 00:02:00.079
The first thing we gotta do is draw a free-body
diagram.

00:02:00.079 --> 00:02:03.880
First, the force of gravity, mg, is pulling
down, on the center of the ladder.

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:08.440
And the force from the wall has only one component
-- it’s pushing sideways on the ladder.

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:11.400
Meanwhile, the force from the floor has
two components:

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:15.100
one pushing UP on the ladder,
equal and opposite to the force of gravity

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:19.740
and one pushing on the ladder toward the wall, equal and opposite to the force FROM the wall.

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:21.860
Let’s talk about the force from the wall
first.

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:26.660
We don’t know how strong it is. But we can figure that out, by thinking about the torques acting on the ladder.

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:31.159
The ladder isn’t rotating, so any torques
on it have to add up to zero.

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:35.620
And we know from our previous lessons that torque is caused by a force applied at a distance from an axis.

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:39.220
So, if we choose the point where the ladder
touches the floor as our axis,

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:42.719
we can see that there are two forces
applying a torque to the ladder.

00:02:42.719 --> 00:02:46.360
In this case, the ladder is leaning to the
RIGHT to meet the wall, so the force of gravity

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:47.989
is applying a clockwise torque.

00:02:47.989 --> 00:02:51.090
And the force from the wall is applying a
counterclockwise torque.

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:55.579
And we know that both of those torques equal each other, because the net torque on the ladder is zero.

00:02:55.579 --> 00:02:59.610
The torque from gravity is equal to the ladder’s
weight, times the perpendicular distance from

00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:04.150
our axis to the center of the ladder -- and
that’s 147 Newton meters.

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:09.590
Meaning that the torque from the WALL is also
147 Newton meters, in the opposite direction.

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:13.980
Divide that by the vertical distance from where the ladder hits the wall to our axis of rotation,

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:18.640
and we get 36.8 Newtons: the
force from the wall on the ladder.

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:20.319
That’s half of the problem done!

00:03:20.319 --> 00:03:22.909
But what about the force on the ladder from
the floor?

00:03:22.909 --> 00:03:27.540
Like we said, there are two components of
the force from the floor: horizontal and vertical.

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:33.140
The horizontal component will be equal to
the force from the wall -- so, 36.8 Newtons.

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:37.299
And the vertical component will be equal to
the ladder’s weight -- so, 98 Newtons.

00:03:37.299 --> 00:03:41.309
We’ve already talked about how to find the
total magnitude of a force from its components

00:03:41.309 --> 00:03:45.789
-- you square the components, add the results,
then take the square root of that number.

00:03:45.789 --> 00:03:49.740
Meaning that the total force from the floor
on the ladder is 105 Newtons.

00:03:49.749 --> 00:03:56.149
So, once you know that an object’s in equilibrium,
you can use that fact to find the forces and torques acting on it.

00:03:56.149 --> 00:04:00.799
That’s important, because those forces can
affect the object’s shape -- and maybe even break it.

00:04:00.799 --> 00:04:03.799
That’s why one of the main questions that
engineers consider is:

00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:06.840
When I apply a force to this thing, what will
happen to it?

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:10.000
And generally, whatever happens will be one
of three main things:

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:14.400
First, you can apply just enough force that
the object will either stretch or compress,

00:04:14.409 --> 00:04:19.920
but still spring back -- in that case, the
force is in a range known as the material’s elastic zone.

00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:24.420
But if you apply a little too much force,
the object might become permanently deformed

00:04:24.420 --> 00:04:27.610
-- meaning, the force has reached what’s
called the plastic zone.

00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:32.060
And apply WAY too much force, and you’ll get to the breaking point -- otherwise known as fracture.

00:04:32.060 --> 00:04:36.800
Ideally, engineers want to make sure that the objects they use to build things, like support beams,

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:40.100
stay within the range of Option
Number One: the elastic zone.

00:04:40.100 --> 00:04:45.520
Often, they’ll also want to know how an object’s shape changes based on the amount of force that’s being applied to it.

00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:50.540
And the amount that an object stretches or
compresses depends on a few different factors:

00:04:50.540 --> 00:04:55.740
First, there’s the original length of the object. The longer it is, the more it will stretch or compress.

00:04:55.740 --> 00:05:00.710
The strength of the applied force also matters.
More force means more stretching or compressing.

00:05:00.710 --> 00:05:03.630
Then there’s the area of a cross-section
of this object.

00:05:03.630 --> 00:05:07.280
Basically, the thicker it is, the less it will STRETCH or compress.

00:05:07.290 --> 00:05:12.450
Finally, there’s the type of material itself.
Wood, steel, aluminum, granite --

00:05:12.450 --> 00:05:15.140
they’re all going to have different amounts of elasticity.

00:05:15.140 --> 00:05:17.960
That’s why engineers use something called Young’s modulus.

00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:20.320
It’s a number, represented by a capital E,

00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:25.960
that tells you how hard it is to stretch or compress a given material, based on that material’s stiffness.

00:05:25.960 --> 00:05:29.860
The higher Young’s modulus is, for a certain
material, the less ELASTIC it is.

00:05:29.860 --> 00:05:32.580
And all of these factors combine into one
equation.

00:05:32.580 --> 00:05:36.810
It might look kind of messy, but this equation
is just saying that the change in length of

00:05:36.810 --> 00:05:40.210
something that’s being stretched or compressed
depends on:

00:05:40.210 --> 00:05:45.660
its original length, the force you apply,
its cross-sectional area, and Young’s modulus.

00:05:45.660 --> 00:05:51.320
And we can use this equation to help define a couple of terms that engineers use a lot: stress and strain.

00:05:51.320 --> 00:05:54.440
Now, these aren’t the same as the feelings you get the night before a huge exam.

00:05:54.450 --> 00:05:58.250
Instead, stress is the force on an object,
divided by its cross-sectional area --

00:05:58.250 --> 00:06:00.040
basically, that F over A term.

00:06:00.050 --> 00:06:03.430
And strain is the object’s change in length,
divided by its original length.

00:06:03.430 --> 00:06:06.990
This equation, and Young’s modulus, apply
for two types of stress:

00:06:06.990 --> 00:06:12.350
‘tensile stress’, which stretches objects out,
and ‘compressive stress’, which compresses them.

00:06:12.350 --> 00:06:16.180
But sometimes the forces you apply to objects
aren’t just compressing or stretching.

00:06:16.180 --> 00:06:19.220
For example: you could also apply what’s
known as shear stress.

00:06:19.220 --> 00:06:20.960
Maybe you’ve done this before:

00:06:20.960 --> 00:06:26.040
Say there’s a really thick book laying on a table -- say, Game of Thrones or a big dictionary.

00:06:26.040 --> 00:06:31.320
If you push the top of the book parallel to the table, the pages will all sort of slide over each other.

00:06:31.330 --> 00:06:35.940
Where before you had a nice rectangular-looking
book, now you have more of a … parallelogram.

00:06:35.940 --> 00:06:39.000
The sliding happens because you’re
applying a force to the top of the book,

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:42.060
while the table applies an equal and opposite force to the bottom.

00:06:42.070 --> 00:06:43.450
That’s shear stress.

00:06:43.450 --> 00:06:47.060
And the way an object deforms under shear
stress depends on the same kinds of factors

00:06:47.070 --> 00:06:49.380
that are involved when you compress or stretch
something.

00:06:49.380 --> 00:06:54.460
Like, if the original length were longer -- meaning you had a thicker, taller book: That would mean more sliding.

00:06:54.460 --> 00:06:56.080
More force? More sliding.

00:06:56.080 --> 00:07:00.680
More area perpendicular to the force -- in
other words, a book with bigger pages? Less sliding.

00:07:00.690 --> 00:07:04.370
And then there’s the inherent slidy-ness
of the material, that the object is made of,

00:07:04.370 --> 00:07:06.320
which we call the shear modulus.

00:07:06.320 --> 00:07:09.540
Just like Young’s modulus, the shear
modulus is different for every material,

00:07:09.540 --> 00:07:12.120
and is just a number, represented by a capital-G.

00:07:12.130 --> 00:07:15.410
The higher its shear modulus, the less the
object will deform.

00:07:15.410 --> 00:07:19.190
Put all those factors together, and you get
an equation that should look very familiar.

00:07:19.190 --> 00:07:22.430
It’s just like the equation we had before,
for stretching and compressing.

00:07:22.430 --> 00:07:26.450
The only differences are that the original
length, area, and change in length

00:07:26.450 --> 00:07:29.640
represent different parts of the object,
and that we use a different modulus.

00:07:29.650 --> 00:07:33.430
But we have one last type of shape-change
to consider: shrinking!

00:07:33.430 --> 00:07:38.490
This is what happens if you apply a force to all the parts of an object at once -- say, by putting it in water.

00:07:38.490 --> 00:07:41.200
The same factors affect the shape change here,
too.

00:07:41.200 --> 00:07:44.640
The more volume the object originally had,
the more it’ll shrink --

00:07:44.640 --> 00:07:46.800
In other words, the more its volume will change.

00:07:46.800 --> 00:07:51.620
When we’re talking about something submerged in a fluid, we give a different name to the force divided by area.

00:07:51.620 --> 00:07:54.260
And instead of stress,
we call it pressure.

00:07:54.260 --> 00:07:57.120
And the more pressure you apply to an object,
the more it will shrink.

00:07:57.120 --> 00:08:00.140
Finally, some materials are more resistant
to changes in volume --

00:08:00.140 --> 00:08:04.900
and that stiffness is measured by the bulk modulus, represented by a capital-B.

00:08:04.910 --> 00:08:09.260
Combined, these factors form an equation you
can use to predict how much an object will shrink.

00:08:09.260 --> 00:08:12.980
So now you know the three main ways that forces
affect an object’s shape:

00:08:12.980 --> 00:08:15.440
changing its length -- through tensile and
compressive stress,

00:08:15.440 --> 00:08:19.060
deforming it through shear stress,
and changing its volume through pressure.

00:08:19.060 --> 00:08:24.880
And hopefully, now you also have a better understanding of all the thought that goes into making sure buildings and bridges stay up.

00:08:24.880 --> 00:08:29.540
Today, you learned that the net force and torque on an object in equilibrium, must equal zero,

00:08:29.540 --> 00:08:33.620
and you saw how you can use that fact
to calculate individual forces and torques.

00:08:33.620 --> 00:08:39.260
We also talked about the way objects deform under tensile, compressive, and shear stress, as well as pressure.

00:08:39.270 --> 00:08:43.450
