â™ª

00:00:07.708 --> 00:00:10.010
both: OH, HELLO.

00:00:10.043 --> 00:00:13.080
- OKAY, SO, GIL--

00:00:13.113 --> 00:00:14.147
SO I LOOKED OVER
YOUR CHART--

00:00:14.181 --> 00:00:16.016
- OF COURSE,
I'M GIL FAIZON.

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:18.118
- AND I'M GEORGE ST. GEEGLAND
HIS ASSOCIATE.

00:00:18.151 --> 00:00:20.687
- SO I LOOKED OVER YOUR CHART,
AND YOU HAVE MERCURY POISONING.

00:00:20.721 --> 00:00:22.856
- THANK YOU.
- NO, ACTUALLY, IT'S TERRIBLE.

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:25.425
YOU HAVE HIGH LEVELS
OF MERCURY IN YOUR BLOOD,

00:00:25.459 --> 00:00:26.894
WHICH IS A VERY TOXIC POISON.

00:00:26.927 --> 00:00:29.363
- AND THAT'S WHAT
FREDDIE MERCURY DIED OF?

00:00:29.396 --> 00:00:31.365
- NO, HE DIED OF AIDS.

00:00:31.398 --> 00:00:32.933
- RIGHT.
HE WAS POISONED BY IT.

00:00:32.966 --> 00:00:34.568
SO IT WAS MERCURY'S
POISONING.

00:00:34.601 --> 00:00:36.403
- NO, ACTUALL--
- WE'RE SAYING THE SAME THING.

00:00:36.436 --> 00:00:38.105
- CAN I ASK YOU ABOUT
SOME OF YOUR SYMPTOMS?

00:00:38.138 --> 00:00:39.806
ARE YOU FEELING FATIGUE?
- YEAH.

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:41.308
- MUSCLE WEAKNESS?
- YEAH.

00:00:41.341 --> 00:00:43.744
- OKAY, ANY PEELING SKIN?
- YEAH, IT PEELS RIGHT OFF.

00:00:43.777 --> 00:00:45.212
- LIKE WALLPAPER.

00:00:45.245 --> 00:00:48.382
- WELL, THESE ARE ALL SYMPTOMS
OF MERCURY POISONING, SO...

00:00:48.415 --> 00:00:50.117
- I DON'T UNDERSTAND
HOW YOU COULD HAVE THIS.

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:51.451
YOU JUST GOT A CLEAN BILL
OF HEALTH.

00:00:51.485 --> 00:00:53.820
- YEAH. I JUST WENT THROUGH
A DOCTORS CHECKUP.

00:00:53.854 --> 00:00:54.888
- WHO WAS THE PHYSICIAN?

00:00:54.922 --> 00:00:57.124
- ABOUT A MONTH AGO,
I SAW DR. WONG.

00:00:57.157 --> 00:00:58.225
- LOU WONG. YEAH.

00:00:58.258 --> 00:01:00.093
- IS THAT YOUR PRIMARY
PHYSICIAN?

00:01:00.127 --> 00:01:03.430
- HE WAS THE PRIMARY SUSPECT
IN A BOTCHED C-SECTION.

00:01:03.463 --> 00:01:05.065
- YEAH.
- SO HE DIDN'T DO

00:01:05.098 --> 00:01:06.466
ANY BLOOD WORK
OR ANYTHING?

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:07.734
- LOU WONG?
- NO, NO, NO.

00:01:07.768 --> 00:01:10.137
HE WAS WAVING A GUN AROUND
AND SCREAMING.

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:12.573
RACE RIOT THIS, RACE RIOT THAT.
- YEAH.

00:01:12.606 --> 00:01:14.374
- I'M GONNA PRESCRIBE
A SUPPLEMENT FOR YOU

00:01:14.408 --> 00:01:15.909
OF SELENIUM,
AND I WOULD RECOMMEND

00:01:15.943 --> 00:01:17.911
THAT YOU STOP EATING
ALL FISH.

00:01:17.945 --> 00:01:19.680
- I MEAN, I EAT A LITTLE BIT
OF TUNA FISH.

00:01:19.713 --> 00:01:22.082
- OCCASIONALLY TUNA FISH.
- OCCASIONALLY.

00:01:22.082 --> 00:01:23.283
- OKAY, OCCASIONALLY.

00:01:23.317 --> 00:01:24.751
UM, WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?

00:01:24.785 --> 00:01:26.420
- I DON'T KNOW,
I DON'T HAVE MORE THAN

00:01:26.453 --> 00:01:29.556
THREE DOLLOPS OF TUNA,
YOU KNOW, PER MEAL.

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:30.891
- TWO, THREE ICE CREAM
SCOOP'S WORTH?

00:01:30.924 --> 00:01:33.527
- YEAH. I MEAN, ABOUT
A "HANDSFUL" IS ONE DOLLOP.

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:37.364
- YOU HAVE THREE MEALS
OF TUNA FISH PER DAY?

00:01:37.397 --> 00:01:39.132
- YOU GOTTA EAT BREAKFAST,
LUNCH, AND DINNER, DON'T YOU?

00:01:39.166 --> 00:01:40.834
- THREE SQUARES, OR ROUNDS,
IF YOU'RE TALKING

00:01:40.868 --> 00:01:42.803
ABOUT TUNA DOLLOPS.
- OKAY.

00:01:42.836 --> 00:01:44.872
- I DON'T THINK WE'VE BEEN
EATING TOO MUCH TUNA.

00:01:44.905 --> 00:01:47.374
- OKAY. I RECOMMEND
THAT YOU SHOULD REALLY

00:01:47.407 --> 00:01:49.443
STOP EATING TUNA ALTOGETHER.

00:01:49.476 --> 00:01:52.646
- I DON'T THINK
THAT'S TOO MUCH TUNA.

00:01:52.679 --> 00:01:54.948
- WELL, IT--IT IS.

00:01:54.982 --> 00:01:58.118
- I'VE BEEN EATING...
TOO MUCH TUNA.

00:01:58.118 --> 00:02:00.153
[clears throat]
- UH-OH.

00:02:00.187 --> 00:02:01.221
- OH, WHAT COULD THIS BE?
- WHAT IS THIS?

00:02:01.255 --> 00:02:02.222
- WHAT'S THIS?

00:02:02.256 --> 00:02:03.223
- WHAT IS THE MEANING
OF THIS?

00:02:03.257 --> 00:02:06.360
- WHAT'S THAT?

00:02:06.393 --> 00:02:08.161
- IT'S A VERY OLD SANDWICH.

00:02:08.195 --> 00:02:10.163
- YOU'VE JUST BEEN PRANKED.
- YOU IDIOT.

00:02:10.197 --> 00:02:11.532
YOU STUPID BITCH.

00:02:11.565 --> 00:02:13.767
THERE'S A SANDWICH
ON YOUR DESK NOW.

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:15.068
TOO MUCH TUNA.

00:02:15.068 --> 00:02:17.504
[orchestral wind up]

00:02:19.273 --> 00:02:21.675
- RIGHT. WELL, BESIDES
IT BEING MERCURY POISONING,

00:02:21.708 --> 00:02:23.410
IT'S ACTUALLY FOOD POISONING
BECAUSE

00:02:23.443 --> 00:02:24.978
THAT MAYONNAISE SEEMS WARM.

00:02:25.078 --> 00:02:26.880
- I MEAN,
THE MAYONNAISE IS CURDLED,

00:02:26.914 --> 00:02:28.549
BUT HE'S BUILT UP
A TOLERANCE.

00:02:28.582 --> 00:02:30.150
- WELL, IT DOESN'T SMELL GOOD.

00:02:30.184 --> 00:02:31.518
- IT'S TURNING, ISN'T IT?
- YEAH. AND I HAVE--

00:02:31.552 --> 00:02:34.254
- PLUS, I SWITCHED OFF THE A.C.
WHEN I CAME IN.
