00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:03.180
Last time I was in Pittsburgh.
Well,
the first time rather I said,

2
00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:06.060
well not even the first time.
One of the Times I was in Pittsburgh,

3
00:00:06.090 --> 00:00:08.250
I was there for a furry convention.
Oh,

4
00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:12.120
I was there for UFC and the UFC was in Pittsburgh at the same time a furry

5
00:00:12.121 --> 00:00:15.210
convention was on.
That's when I found out about furries.

6
00:00:15.510 --> 00:00:20.510
I had a nice long conversation with the dudes who work behind the desk at the

7
00:00:20.731 --> 00:00:24.030
hotel where they were telling me the firies were asking for their food in bowls

8
00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:26.190
so they can eat off the ground.
No.
Yeah,

9
00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:29.370
they were all furries except us like a fuck is going on.
Went with me.

10
00:00:29.371 --> 00:00:33.330
I forget who opened for me and my have been Duncan,
but um,
the,

11
00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:38.130
they were asking for a litter box so they could shit and piss in a box.

12
00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:41.910
I want to do that.
No you don't.
No,
I don't.
Just for a laugh.

13
00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:45.240
How are you going to wipe?
Where are you going to do to finish?
Well,

14
00:00:45.330 --> 00:00:46.800
it's like grown men who want to be a,

15
00:00:46.801 --> 00:00:50.070
they want to wear diapers and have somebody spank them and change them.
And,
well,

16
00:00:50.071 --> 00:00:54.120
here's what's interesting and there's a lot of people that think that,

17
00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:59.400
look,
I am 100% in support of people being trans.

18
00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:01.440
Don't get me wrong if you want,
I'm in sport.

19
00:01:01.441 --> 00:01:03.670
I'm just bored of you being whenever you want to being.
Um,

20
00:01:03.671 --> 00:01:06.900
I'm a person who believes in free will or your,

21
00:01:06.901 --> 00:01:09.780
your ability to freely express yourself,
I should say.

22
00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:13.650
But if you work for a corporation,
you work for a Tech Corporation,

23
00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:17.670
especially a particularly Progressive Tech Corporation.

24
00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:19.650
You run into some real problems.

25
00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:24.780
And I was talking to a guy who was telling me the,
you don't know the half of it,

26
00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:27.740
that we're dealing with a guy who,
uh,

27
00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:31.770
he identifies as an animal and that he,

28
00:01:31.870 --> 00:01:33.810
he believes that he's kin,

29
00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:38.760
like he's a fox can or a dog cat or something like that and he wants a litter

30
00:01:38.761 --> 00:01:40.080
box in his office.

31
00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:44.960
This guy wants to be able to shat in his fucking office into a,

32
00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:48.750
a box of now.
I appreciate that.

33
00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:52.410
Now I want to say this about him and I'm not a psychiatrist and I have no right

34
00:01:52.411 --> 00:01:57.240
to really diagnose,
but he's fucking crazy.
Yeah,
he is crazy.
But here's the thing,

35
00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:01.890
like you're letting people be crazy correctly when you're letting a six foot

36
00:02:01.891 --> 00:02:06.891
four man compete in women's weightlifting because he's decided that he's a woman

37
00:02:07.051 --> 00:02:12.051
now and now he's winning and he's wearing makeup and he looks like a gorilla and

38
00:02:12.151 --> 00:02:15.890
he's onstage lifting his arms up.
Yay.
Diversity.
You're,

39
00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:20.400
you're stealing from women's stealing.
You're stealing,
cheating,
you're cheating.

40
00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:24.720
You're fucking 100% cheating.
And then anybody says or not,
you're an asshole,

41
00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:29.190
you're an asshole.
But you know,
this is about humanness.
And when,
when,

42
00:02:29.191 --> 00:02:33.690
when someone's feelings,
how they identify in that moment,

43
00:02:33.691 --> 00:02:37.770
which of course are so transitory,
right?
I mean I'm,
I the whole my fucking,

44
00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:41.180
not to bring it back,
but the whole idea of complicated apes is,
was your,

45
00:02:41.181 --> 00:02:45.150
your new specialists and it's available basically everywhere.
Right?

46
00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:51.000
You could get it on iTunes.
He will have it.
It does.

47
00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:53.970
Oh my God,
this crew and wherever the fuck look under here,

48
00:02:53.971 --> 00:02:56.730
if I look in your sock drawer,
there's my Spanish stocked on the side.

49
00:02:56.900 --> 00:03:00.100
That's amazing.
But,
but,
but I,
but I do think that,
you know,

50
00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:03.700
we are complicated like were were bipolar apes,

51
00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:05.440
sinners and saints and everything in between.

52
00:03:05.441 --> 00:03:08.650
I'm not so it your feelings how you feel.

53
00:03:08.651 --> 00:03:11.470
Sometimes I feel like an asshole and other times I feel like a saint and

54
00:03:11.471 --> 00:03:15.400
everything in between you,
you know,
it's very difficult to,
you know,

55
00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:17.140
say well this is your a noun,

56
00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:19.870
which means you're this as opposed to sort of a verb,

57
00:03:19.871 --> 00:03:21.640
which is I'm always changing.
And that,

58
00:03:21.641 --> 00:03:25.150
that to me is the problem with when you identify,
when you,

59
00:03:25.151 --> 00:03:27.520
when you emotionally identify with something,

60
00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:32.590
well for now you do for now that that's what's important to you.
But I can't,

61
00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:36.610
I can't tailor my life and my entire corporation,

62
00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:39.430
this is what the part of the problem is and this is what you just hit on.

63
00:03:39.820 --> 00:03:42.310
Part of the problem is these people want to be special for no reason at all.

64
00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:44.650
Correct.
And so to be special for no reason at all.

65
00:03:44.651 --> 00:03:48.640
One of the best ways is to do a Bruce Jenner.
Did he become Caitlyn Jenner?

66
00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:49.720
And then he special?

67
00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:54.730
That guy was a fucking loser even though he was a gigantic superstar in the

68
00:03:54.731 --> 00:03:57.640
Olympics 40 years ago.
But from then on,

69
00:03:57.670 --> 00:04:01.690
they shat on that guy every fucking show.
That's right.
They shit on him.

70
00:04:01.691 --> 00:04:03.760
He was the buffoon of that show.

71
00:04:04.270 --> 00:04:08.080
And then all of a sudden he becomes a woman ever is like,
you're amazing.

72
00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:11.410
And we'll maybe go woman of the year and a woman for six months.

73
00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:14.320
All the women that do things like Christina [inaudible] came up with Christa

74
00:04:14.380 --> 00:04:18.580
because CRISPR cas nine and all those,
Oh,
is this the guy?
Okay,
this is hilarious.

75
00:04:18.850 --> 00:04:22.060
This is a dude who's a comic,
is the comics of browser rapper.

76
00:04:22.061 --> 00:04:24.580
He's a rapper and he's fucking jacked.

77
00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:28.600
So he decided to identify as a woman wanted me to.

78
00:04:28.601 --> 00:04:33.070
So it destroys the British women's deadlift record without even trying.
Wow.

79
00:04:33.190 --> 00:04:37.780
Ps identified as a woman whilst lifting weights don't be a bigot.
I love it.

80
00:04:39.110 --> 00:04:41.620
He's so jacked.
Imagine that.

81
00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:45.730
So two biological men don't have any physical strength advantage over women in

82
00:04:45.731 --> 00:04:49.890
2019 okay.
Anybody says that is a fool.
That's,
that's foolish.

83
00:04:49.900 --> 00:04:53.830
There's a reason why it,
yeah.
Good for him.
What's his name?
Zuby.
Zuby.

84
00:04:54.880 --> 00:04:59.200
Zuby is his stage name.
Shout out to Zubin Oxford graduate.

85
00:04:59.230 --> 00:05:03.130
It doesn't that mean you're a Rhode Scholar?
Zubie congratulations to you,
sir.

86
00:05:03.131 --> 00:05:04.240
I'm following you right now.

87
00:05:04.300 --> 00:05:08.530
I'm going to go right to my goddamn Twitter for all the shirt free.
Thank God.

88
00:05:08.531 --> 00:05:09.370
Bless you.
Look,

89
00:05:09.371 --> 00:05:14.371
it's like this is silliness for six and here's the problem with a lot of these

90
00:05:15.041 --> 00:05:18.530
progressive's is that they're really nice people.
That's what it is.

91
00:05:18.640 --> 00:05:21.790
Be follows me,
and now I follow him.
Shout out to Zubin.

92
00:05:21.830 --> 00:05:24.970
They're nice people as long as you have to with them.
Yes,
exactly.
If you don't,

93
00:05:24.971 --> 00:05:26.050
they try to DDI platform.
You.
