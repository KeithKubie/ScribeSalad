00:00:00.447 --> 00:00:01.677
- [Voiceover] So what we have here is

00:00:01.677 --> 00:00:03.637
x being defined in terms of t and

00:00:03.637 --> 00:00:06.129
y being defined in terms of t,

00:00:06.129 --> 00:00:08.172
and then if you were to plot
over all of the t values,

00:00:08.172 --> 00:00:10.683
you'd get a pretty cool
plot, just like this.

00:00:10.683 --> 00:00:13.281
So you try, t equals zero, and
figure out what x and y are,

00:00:13.281 --> 00:00:15.388
t is equal to one, figure
out what x and y are,

00:00:15.388 --> 00:00:16.818
and all of the other ts,

00:00:16.818 --> 00:00:20.262
and then you get this
pretty cool-looking graph.

00:00:20.262 --> 00:00:22.573
But the goal in this video
isn't just to appreciate

00:00:22.573 --> 00:00:24.977
the coolness of graphs or curves,

00:00:24.977 --> 00:00:27.194
defined by parametric equations.

00:00:27.194 --> 00:00:29.003
But we actually want to do some calculus,

00:00:29.003 --> 00:00:32.770
in particular, we wanna
find the derivative,

00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:37.406
we wanna find the derivative
of y, with respect to x,

00:00:37.406 --> 00:00:39.819
the derivative of y with respect to x,

00:00:39.819 --> 00:00:41.152
when t,

00:00:42.359 --> 00:00:44.182
when t is equal

00:00:44.182 --> 00:00:47.173
to negative one third.

00:00:47.173 --> 00:00:48.978
And if you are inspired, I encourage you

00:00:48.978 --> 00:00:51.580
to pause and try to solve this.

00:00:51.580 --> 00:00:52.787
And I am about to do it with you,

00:00:52.787 --> 00:00:55.645
in case you already did,
or you just want me to.

00:00:55.645 --> 00:00:57.369
(chuckles) All right, so the key is,

00:00:57.369 --> 00:01:00.147
is well, how do you find the
derivative with respect to x,

00:01:00.147 --> 00:01:01.569
derivative of y with respect to x,

00:01:01.569 --> 00:01:03.662
when they're both defined in terms of t?

00:01:03.662 --> 00:01:07.761
And the key realization
is the derivative of y

00:01:07.761 --> 00:01:11.351
with respect to x, with respect to x,

00:01:11.351 --> 00:01:15.413
is going to be equal to,
is going to be equal to,

00:01:15.413 --> 00:01:18.580
the derivative of y with respect to t,

00:01:19.472 --> 00:01:23.305
over the derivative of
x with respect to t.

00:01:24.619 --> 00:01:27.262
If you were to view these
differentials as numbers,

00:01:27.262 --> 00:01:30.109
well this would actually
work out mathematically.

00:01:30.109 --> 00:01:32.177
Now, it gets a little bit non-rigorous,

00:01:32.177 --> 00:01:33.602
when you start to do that,

00:01:33.602 --> 00:01:35.944
but, if you though of it that,
it's an easy way of thinking

00:01:35.944 --> 00:01:38.457
about why this actually might make sense.

00:01:38.457 --> 00:01:40.462
The derivative of something
versus something else,

00:01:40.462 --> 00:01:43.401
is equal to the derivative
of y with respect to t,

00:01:43.401 --> 00:01:45.629
over x with respect to t.

00:01:45.629 --> 00:01:47.623
All right, so how does that help us?

00:01:47.623 --> 00:01:48.634
Well, we can figure out

00:01:48.634 --> 00:01:50.123
the derivative of x with respect to t

00:01:50.123 --> 00:01:52.476
and the derivative of y with respect to t.

00:01:52.476 --> 00:01:55.754
The derivative of x with respect to t

00:01:55.754 --> 00:01:57.932
is just going to be equal to,

00:01:57.932 --> 00:01:59.514
let's see, the derivative of the outside,

00:01:59.514 --> 00:02:03.442
with respect to the inside,
it's going to be two sine

00:02:03.442 --> 00:02:06.189
whoops, the derivative of sign is cosine,

00:02:06.189 --> 00:02:08.772
two cosine of one plus three t,

00:02:09.620 --> 00:02:13.086
times the derivative of the
inside with respect to t.

00:02:13.086 --> 00:02:16.250
So that's going to be,
derivative of one is just zero.

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:19.023
Derivative of three t with
respect to t is three.

00:02:19.023 --> 00:02:22.917
So times three, that's the
derivative of x with respect to t

00:02:22.917 --> 00:02:24.455
I just used the Chain Rule here.

00:02:24.455 --> 00:02:28.455
Derivative of the outside
two sine of something,

00:02:29.319 --> 00:02:31.780
with respect to the inside,

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:34.596
so derivative of this outside,

00:02:34.596 --> 00:02:38.089
two sine of something with
respect to one plus three t,

00:02:38.089 --> 00:02:39.827
is that right over there.

00:02:39.827 --> 00:02:42.069
And the derivative of the
inside with respect to t,

00:02:42.069 --> 00:02:43.805
is just our three.

00:02:43.805 --> 00:02:45.752
Now, the derivative of y with respect to t

00:02:45.752 --> 00:02:47.798
is a little bit more straight-forward.

00:02:47.798 --> 00:02:49.385
Derivative of y with respect to t,

00:02:49.385 --> 00:02:52.026
we just apply the Power Rule here,

00:02:52.026 --> 00:02:56.221
three times two is six, t to
the three minus one power,

00:02:56.221 --> 00:02:57.388
six t squared.

00:02:58.310 --> 00:03:02.143
So this is going to be
equal to six t squared,

00:03:03.629 --> 00:03:06.046
six t squared, over,

00:03:07.615 --> 00:03:09.783
well, we have the two times the three,

00:03:09.783 --> 00:03:12.033
so we have six times cosine

00:03:13.253 --> 00:03:14.920
of one plus three t,

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:20.283
and then our sixes cancel
out, and we are left with,

00:03:20.283 --> 00:03:23.533
we are left with t squared over

00:03:24.583 --> 00:03:26.833
cosine of one plus three t.

00:03:28.184 --> 00:03:32.975
And if we care when t is
equal to negative one third,

00:03:32.975 --> 00:03:35.007
when t is equal to negative one third,

00:03:35.007 --> 00:03:37.826
this is going to be equal to, well,

00:03:37.826 --> 00:03:40.479
this is going to be equal to
negative one third squared.

00:03:40.479 --> 00:03:43.598
Negative one third squared,

00:03:43.598 --> 00:03:45.182
over,

00:03:45.182 --> 00:03:46.515
over,

00:03:47.587 --> 00:03:48.433
over

00:03:48.433 --> 00:03:51.520
the cosine of one plus three times

00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:52.895
negative one third is negative one.

00:03:52.895 --> 00:03:55.676
So it's one plus negative
one, so it's a cosine of zero.

00:03:55.676 --> 00:03:58.022
And the cosine of zero
is just going to be one.

00:03:58.022 --> 00:04:01.330
So this is going to be equal to positive,

00:04:01.330 --> 00:04:03.312
positive one ninth.

00:04:03.312 --> 00:04:05.868
Now let's see if we can
visualize what's going on here.

00:04:05.868 --> 00:04:08.832
So let me draw a little table here.

00:04:08.832 --> 00:04:11.707
So, I'm gonna plot,

00:04:11.707 --> 00:04:14.685
I'm gonna think about t, and x, and y.

00:04:14.685 --> 00:04:18.442
So t, and x, and y.

00:04:18.442 --> 00:04:21.859
So when t is equal to negative one third,

00:04:22.816 --> 00:04:25.242
well our x is going to
be, this is going to be

00:04:25.242 --> 00:04:28.773
sine of zero, so our
x is going to be zero,

00:04:28.773 --> 00:04:31.874
and our why is going
to be, what, two over,

00:04:31.874 --> 00:04:36.310
or negative two over 27.

00:04:36.310 --> 00:04:38.785
So, we're talking about,
we're talking about

00:04:38.785 --> 00:04:42.768
the point zero comma negative two over 27.

00:04:42.768 --> 00:04:45.971
So that is that point right over there.

00:04:45.971 --> 00:04:47.918
That's the point where
we're trying to find

00:04:47.918 --> 00:04:49.145
the slope of the tangent line.

00:04:49.145 --> 00:04:52.196
It's telling us that
that slope is one ninth,

00:04:52.196 --> 00:04:55.051
that slope is one ninth, so if we move,

00:04:55.051 --> 00:04:56.864
I guess one way to think
about it is if we move

00:04:56.864 --> 00:05:00.468
four, one, two, three, four and a half,

00:05:00.468 --> 00:05:02.736
we're gonna move up half.

00:05:02.736 --> 00:05:05.887
So, if I wanted to draw the
tangent line right there,

00:05:05.887 --> 00:05:08.444
it would look something like,

00:05:08.444 --> 00:05:10.111
something like that.

00:05:11.838 --> 00:05:15.488
Something, something,

00:05:15.488 --> 00:05:16.396
something like that.

00:05:16.396 --> 00:05:18.942
Let's see if we've got,
one, two, three, four,

00:05:18.942 --> 00:05:20.163
and a half, that's what we got,

00:05:20.163 --> 00:05:23.376
just like that is pretty close.

00:05:23.376 --> 00:05:24.458
So that's what we just figured out.

00:05:24.458 --> 00:05:26.317
We figured out that the
slope of the tangent line,

00:05:26.317 --> 00:05:28.440
right at that point is one ninth.

00:05:28.440 --> 00:05:31.509
So, it's not only neat to look at,

00:05:31.509 --> 00:05:33.842
but I guess somewhat useful.
