00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
Let's start by focusing on this positively charged particle.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
If it is positively charged particle, we know there are two forces acting on it.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
There is this horizontal force pulling it towards the negative charge

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.000
and there's this vertical force pulling it along the electric field

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.000
and we know that when we add this two vectors together,

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.000
we get a net force vector that makes this angle θ1 with the horizontal.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:24.000
And using our knowledge of trigonometry, we can conclude that the tangent of this angle θ1

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
must be equal to the force caused by the electric field

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
divided by the force pulling the positive charge towards the negative charge

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.000
and it turns out, I can write a similar equation for the negatively charged particle.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:40.000
Now I'm going to take this two equations and divide this equation by this equation

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.000
and doing that division, I get this equation here.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.000
Now, in order to clean things up a bit here, we need to make one key observation.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:50.000
We know from Newton's Third Law that when this positive charge

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.000
pulls on this negative charge that the negative charge

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.000
pulls back on the positive charge with an identical force.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.000
This means that this horizontal forces must be exactly the same.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.000
We can actually cancel out these two forces terms here.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.000
This gives us that the ratio of the tangents between the two angles

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:10.000
is equal to the ratio between the forces the two particles feel from the electric field,

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:13.000
and we can always write the forces the particles feel from our electric field

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.000
as just the electric field's strength times the charge on those particles.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:19.000
And we see here that the electric field strength will cancel

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:21.000
leaving just the ratio of the two charges.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:25.000
This means that the ratio of the charges on the two particles is exactly equal

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:31.000
to the ratio of the tangents of the angles that the net force vectors make with the horizontal.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:35.000
That's pretty cool and pointing in my known values for this angles here,

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:37.000
I can calculate the ratio of these two tangents.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:41.000
In this case, we got the ratio between these two charges is about equal to nine.

00:01:41.000 --> 99:59:59.000
If you're able to get this, great work.
