00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:02.110
Let's take a minute to check if we

00:00:02.110 --> 00:00:05.926
understood the relationship between latency and throughput. Suppose

00:00:05.926 --> 00:00:09.120
we are running a website for ordering penguin-shaped

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:12.960
USB drives. Our website has two servers and

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:15.960
it works as follows. An order request will

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:17.940
be assigned to one of the servers very

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:22.090
quickly. A server takes one millisecond to process

00:00:22.090 --> 00:00:25.210
a single order and a server cannot do anything

00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:29.180
else while processing an order. So the question for

00:00:29.180 --> 00:00:34.450
you is, what does this website have for throughput in

00:00:34.450 --> 00:00:38.010
orders per second, so how many orders per second, and

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:41.630
what's the latency for orders in this website in milliseconds?
