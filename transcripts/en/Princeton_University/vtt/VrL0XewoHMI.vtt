GORAN K. HANSSON: The Royal
Swedish Academy of Sciences

00:00:03.900 --> 00:00:08.560
has today decided to award
the Sveriges Riksbank

00:00:08.560 --> 00:00:12.760
Prize in Economic Sciences
in memory of Alfred Nobel

00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:19.430
to Angus Deaton for his analysis
of consumption, poverty,

00:00:19.430 --> 00:00:20.200
and welfare.

00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:28.140
ANGUS DEATON: 6:10 this
morning-- and I remember

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:32.060
the time pretty precisely-- the
phone rang and Ann picked it up

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:33.430
before I could
get through to it.

00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:35.190
We were both awake.

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:37.610
And she handed it
to me and there

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:43.520
was this very nice
Swedish lady saying,

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:45.030
is this Professor Angus Deaton?

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:47.600
I have an important call
for him from Stockholm.

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:50.450
So I had a pretty good
idea of what it was then.

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:52.050
This really seemed
like for real.

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:53.490
And I still feel
a little bit bit

00:00:53.490 --> 00:00:57.020
that we might pinch
ourselves and wake up.

00:00:57.020 --> 00:01:02.530
And I'll be back in bed and
it'll be an ordinary day.

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:05.370
I am pretty pleased, yes.

CHRISTOPHER L. EISGRUBER: I
myself first met Angus shortly

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:17.700
after I joined the Woodrow
Wilson School faculty

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:20.710
and was immediately
impressed with his leadership

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:22.670
in the school and
his willingness

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:24.810
to tackle important questions.

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:27.630
I am thrilled that this
year's Nobel Prize was awarded

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:30.230
to someone who is
both a great economist

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:32.600
and a great Princetonian.

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:35.020
CECILIA ROUSE: He's a
giant in this field,

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:37.240
but not one to wear
that on his sleeve.

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:38.830
He's a true gentleman.

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:41.110
He's kind to colleagues,
students, and staff

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:43.600
equally, and respected by all.

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:46.470
He's also a wonderful
friend and, Angus,

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:47.570
I couldn't be more proud.

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:48.920
Congratulations.

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:50.850
You do the school so very proud.

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:52.250
Thank you.

SHOUMITRO CHATTERJEE: This
is the news that all of us

00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:02.560
had been waiting
for for a long time.

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:06.000
We are all very, very excited.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.440
His contributions in
academia are tremendous.

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:11.400
We learned a lot
from his scholarship

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:15.330
so this is fantastic news.

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:17.290
JANET CURRIE: Angus has
had enormous influence

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:20.290
with or without the Nobel Prize.

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:23.570
And so, I want to raise
a toast to influencing

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:26.840
the world through your work
and through your students--

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:30.690
something we all aspire to.

SUBJECT 1: Would
it be OK if we take

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:47.160
one quick picture with you?

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:47.760
