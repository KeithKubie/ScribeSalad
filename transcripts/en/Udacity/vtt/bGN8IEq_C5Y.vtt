00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:03.160
Pictorially, the Kalman
filter looks like this.

00:00:03.160 --> 00:00:04.050
Nice Gaussian.

00:00:04.050 --> 00:00:05.040
I don't know why I'm drawing this.

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:05.860
It's already here.

00:00:05.860 --> 00:00:07.170
A Gaussian, I'll circle it.

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:08.710
We start off with that Gaussian.

00:00:08.710 --> 00:00:11.940
We then have the linear prediction part,
which does the shift.

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:14.120
We then say, but wait a minute,
there may be some noise,

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:15.470
so things get widened.

00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:17.689
We take our measurement,
and we sort of blend.

00:00:17.689 --> 00:00:21.305
Remember, it was that the Kalman
filter is a, a blending between your

00:00:21.305 --> 00:00:24.450
prediction, which was what our,
our prediction here was.

00:00:24.450 --> 00:00:29.231
And your measurement, and it creates
a new estimate that's a weighted average

00:00:29.231 --> 00:00:33.228
between those, depending upon
the relative uncertainties, and

00:00:33.228 --> 00:00:37.030
the uncertainty gets smaller
after we take the measurements.

00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:39.261
So uncertainty gets bigger
when we do our prediction,

00:00:39.261 --> 00:00:41.200
because we don't know
exactly what happened,

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:43.489
and it gets smaller again
when we take the measurement.

00:00:43.489 --> 00:00:47.948
We said nice things about it was
that it's simple, it's compact,

00:00:47.948 --> 00:00:50.810
it's efficient and
it's very easy to spell.

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:52.364
The cons of it are in fact,

00:00:52.364 --> 00:00:55.480
maybe I should have listed
these in the other order.

00:00:55.480 --> 00:00:59.075
Here it says, we'll say there's sort of
a restricted class of motions defined by

00:00:59.075 --> 00:01:00.320
the linear model.

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:04.250
Linear thing we can get around by using
what's called an extended Kalman filter.

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:06.850
A much bigger problem is, it's nice,

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:10.000
it's got this nice unimodel
distribution assumption.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:14.210
You're assuming the world really is
a nice Gaussian of some uncertainty.

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:19.650
And the question arises, what would you
do, if it, things are not a Gaussian?

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:23.290
So what's an example of when you
might need a non-Gaussian situation?

00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:24.910
Well you remember these videos?

00:01:24.910 --> 00:01:25.452
Okay, and

00:01:25.452 --> 00:01:29.139
again this comes from the Isard and
Blake condensation tracking paper.

00:01:29.139 --> 00:01:32.310
There's all sorts of dynamics going
on here with things jumping around.

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:34.670
Let's see if I do that again,
yeah there she goes.

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:39.540
And things move quickly, they they may
be able to be nice and smooth sometimes,

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:40.890
then something rapid will happen.

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:46.386
So like when the leaves are blowing in
the wind for a while they blow nicely.

00:01:46.386 --> 00:01:50.226
But basically, the problem here is
that things are moving smoothly and

00:01:50.226 --> 00:01:53.042
then all of a sudden you'll
get a perturbation, and

00:01:53.042 --> 00:01:55.410
you'd like to be able
to keep track of that.

00:01:55.410 --> 00:01:58.950
So graphically we're going to
show that like this, okay.

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:04.420
So now we have the same model
that we had before, okay?

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:07.080
We have a,
an estimate from the last time.

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:08.910
We have a deterministic shift.

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:13.010
We apply some smoothing because
we grow the uncertainty.

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:16.814
And then we take our measurement and
we update our estimate.

00:02:16.814 --> 00:02:19.994
But now these are not
Gaussian lumps all right.

00:02:19.994 --> 00:02:22.445
These are sort of arbitrary
distributions, and

00:02:22.445 --> 00:02:25.971
in fact this particular figure is
taken from the paper that introduced

00:02:25.971 --> 00:02:30.036
the particle filtering that we'll talk
about in a minute, to computer vision,

00:02:30.036 --> 00:02:32.990
that, that condensation paper,
I just mentioned.
