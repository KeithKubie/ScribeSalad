00:00:01.449 --> 00:00:07.009
KANNAN LAKMEEHARAN &gt;&gt; I think-ah-the economy
in 2009 will not recover as long as each government

00:00:07.009 --> 00:00:13.519
takes its own steps without consulting others.
It is important to have a dialog between nations.

00:00:13.519 --> 00:00:17.780
I think some of the issues also are not just
about how we recover about spending but also

00:00:17.780 --> 00:00:22.430
how we ought to live our lives. Ah-we have
to on the fundamental re-think. It's not sustainable.

00:00:22.430 --> 00:00:23.430
Ah-and as--

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:26.710
MYRIAM LAKMEEHARAN &gt;&gt; It's like the leaders
said this morning, we are all in this together.

00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:30.490
KANNAN LAKMEEHARAN &gt;&gt; Yeah. So I think those
are the issues. So it's-all the answers to

00:00:30.490 --> 00:00:35.620
questions that have been put to us at the
Davos debate is 'it depends.' We actually

00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:39.690
have to change the way we think about each
other, the way to relate to each other, and

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:44.760
then try to solve the problems. Ah-I think
we're still courting some old paradigms. Maybe

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:48.180
the crisis needs to deepen before we have
that dialog.

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:54.000
But-ah-I think there's enough people moving
in that direction and I'm positive about that.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:01:00.190
Ah-and I think it will push us probably to
solving the problems we've been talking about

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:04.379
and not getting around-climate change and
the like. There we are.
