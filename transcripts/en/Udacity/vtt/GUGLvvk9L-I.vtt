00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:04.010
Why collecting, modeling, and analyzing requirements? We might realize

00:00:04.010 --> 00:00:07.310
that the resources available for the project are not enough

00:00:07.310 --> 00:00:10.000
to satisfy all of them. For example, there's not

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.450
enough time, not enough money, not enough manpower. And therefore,

00:00:13.450 --> 00:00:15.590
there are some requirements that we won't be able

00:00:15.590 --> 00:00:19.760
to satisfy. In these cases, we must prioritize our requirements,

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:22.310
by classifying them in one of three classes. The

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:25.270
first class is mandatory requirements, and these are the requirements

00:00:25.270 --> 00:00:29.770
we must satisfy. Then there are the nice to have requirements that are the

00:00:29.770 --> 00:00:32.170
ones that we will satisfy if resources

00:00:32.170 --> 00:00:34.740
allow. And finally, there are the superfluous

00:00:34.740 --> 00:00:36.440
requirements, and those are the requirements that

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:37.770
we're going to keep around, but that we're

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:40.010
going to postpone. For example, we might decide

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:41.770
to satisfy them in the next release.
