00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:12.880
This is a philosopher who helps us think about money, capitalism, and our runaway consumer societies

00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:16.480
Epicurus was an Ancient Greek born in 341 BC.

00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:21.460
What made him famous was that he spent all his life trying to work out the largest puzzle there is:

00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:23.460
what makes people happy?

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:27.740
Philosophers before him had discussed at length what could make people good

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:30.660
Epicurus preferred to look at what is fun

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:33.760
Unfortunately, the world was bitter and bitchy even then

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:38.140
and when people heard that Epicurus had set up a school to study happiness

00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:40.140
the rumors went off the scale

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:44.320
There were tales that the school hosted ten course feasts, and orgies every night

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:50.540
Epicurus was said, by one critic, to have orgasmed 18 times in a single evening in a bed full of virgins

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:51.880
It wasn't true

00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:57.100
Epicurus and his team were studying happiness, but they were doing it very soberly

00:00:57.100 --> 00:01:02.900
The philosopher owned only two cloaks, and lived on bread, olives, and for a treat, an occasional slice of cheese

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:07.720
As for the bedroom, he merely responded demurely that he'd married philosophy

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:10.440
Having patiently studied happiness for many years

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:16.720
Epicurus came to a set of remarkable and revolutionary conclusions about what we actually need to be happy

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:21.180
He proposed that we typically make 3 mistakes when thinking about happiness:

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:25.580
Firstly, we think happiness means having romantic, sexual relationships

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:29.100
but Epicurus looked around and saw so many unhappy couples

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:32.940
their unions marred by jealousy, misunderstanding, cheating, and bitterness

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:36.500
at the same time, he observed how much nicer friendships are:

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:40.080
How people tend to be so decent and unpossessive with their friends

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:43.400
Friendship seemed to be where human nature was at its sweetest

00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:47.640
The only problem Epicurus noted was that we don't see our friends enough

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:51.960
The next thing we ordinary think that we need to be happy is a lot of money

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:57.680
but we tend not properly to factually the unbelievable sacraficies we gotta have to make to get this money:

00:01:57.680 --> 00:02:00.440
The jealousy, the backbiting, the long hours

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:04.540
What makes work really satisfying, Epicurus believed, ins't money

00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:09.720
but it was able to work alone, or in small groups, like in a bakery, or boat repair shop

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:11.720
and when we feel we helping others

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:14.320
in our own, minor way improving the world

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:16.440
Isn't really large sums or status

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:18.200
that we want deep down

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:20.280
Its a sense of making a diference

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:21.300
and lastely

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:24.040
Epicurus observes how obsessive we are with luxury

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:27.840
especially involving houses and beautiful serene locations

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:31.820
but beneath our love of luxury there is really something else we trying to get out

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:34.360
What we want is a feeling of calm

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:36.460
We want our minds pure, free...

00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:38.320
Not full of the normal boredom and chaos

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:42.480
But the great question is: Does luxury actually make us calm?

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:45.680
Epicurus wasn't so sure...

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:47.560
Having looked happiness in depth

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:50.840
Epicurus anounces a revolution reset of insights

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:55.020
That we really need only three things to be happy in this life

00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:56.240
Firstly

00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:57.920
You need your friends around

00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:00.440
No sex, no orgy, just your mates

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:02.460
Enough of seen them only now and then

00:03:02.460 --> 00:03:05.080
Its regularity of contact that counts

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:08.280
So he did that thing that most of us ocasionally dream of doing

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:10.020
but never actualy get around do

00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:13.680
He bought a big house and start living with all his friends

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:17.620
Everyone had your own quarters and there was pleasant share areas too

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:20.440
There's always someone nice to talk to you in the kitchen

00:03:20.460 --> 00:03:21.080
Secondly

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:23.120
Everyone downshifted

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:25.900
All the members of the comune stop working for other people

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:29.180
They took big pay cuts in return for doing their own stuff

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:32.160
some farming, some cooking, some potring or writing

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:33.440
And thirdly

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:38.620
Epicurus and his friends stop thinking you could be calm just by having a beautiful view to look out to

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:42.440
They devote themselfes to finding calm in their own minds

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:48.100
To spending time on their own, reflecting, writing stuff down, reading things, meditating

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:52.800
The experiment was so successful, the members of the comune so happy

00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:55.320
the idea spread like wildfire

00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:58.900
Epicurean communities open up all around the mediterranean

00:03:58.900 --> 00:03:59.880
at height of the movement

00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:04.580
there was four hundred thousand people living in comunes from Spain to Palestine

00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:08.340
It was only the christian church that ending things in the fifth century

00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:10.900
But in most of the respect to the community somehow

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:13.060
cause they converted all in to monasteries

00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:16.260
what we know as monasteries are really just epicurean comunes

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:18.260
with a christian top soil

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:22.860
Another interesting fact: Karl Marx it's Ph.D thesis on Epicurus

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:25.580
and what we call communism, a gigantic

00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:27.140
failed system

00:04:27.140 --> 00:04:32.600
it's really a grown up, corrupted, not very successful version of epicureanism

00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:38.420
The real Legacy of Epicurus is that human beings aren't very good make themselves happy

00:04:38.420 --> 00:04:40.460
especially because they think it's so easy

00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:43.060
We think we know, it's about sex, money, luxury

00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:45.220
We just want to how to secure all this

00:04:45.220 --> 00:04:46.540
but no, says Epicurus

00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:49.660
Reflect on the moments that truly bring you happiness

00:04:49.660 --> 00:04:51.380
and they are to do with this

00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:57.100
Have the courage to change your life, in accordance with the moments that actually delivery satisfaction

00:04:57.100 --> 00:04:59.840
You might end up living in a very different way

00:04:59.840 --> 00:05:04.240
Out in the country with just some cheese, a couple of clothes, a few philosophy books and

00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:06.940
some very good friends down the corridor
