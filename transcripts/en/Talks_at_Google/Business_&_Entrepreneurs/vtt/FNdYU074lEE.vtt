[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:11.130
JACK TEELING: Hi, guys.

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:12.340
Is this working?

00:00:12.340 --> 00:00:12.840
Yeah.

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:13.690
That's good.

00:00:13.690 --> 00:00:14.980
I'm delighted to be here.

00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:18.120
It's great to see that the
draw of some free whiskey

00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:21.164
on a Friday afternoon still
gets people interested.

00:00:21.164 --> 00:00:22.330
It's [INAUDIBLE] to be here.

00:00:22.330 --> 00:00:24.630
I'm here just to tell you
a little bit about who

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:28.470
we are, what we're trying to
do, and at the same time maybe

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:31.830
impart some nuggets
of information linked

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:35.550
into the rich provenance and
heritage of Dublin and Ireland

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:39.210
in the evolution
of global whiskey.

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:42.210
Because there's lots of
hidden stories and messages

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:44.120
that have been
lost along the way.

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:45.756
And we're lucky,
myself and my brother.

00:00:45.756 --> 00:00:47.130
We're just the
latest generations

00:00:47.130 --> 00:00:48.759
of Teelings involved
in the industry,

00:00:48.759 --> 00:00:50.550
and we're trying to
put our own mark on it.

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:53.140
And we like to say we're
respectful to the past,

00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:55.440
but we're confident
to forge a new future.

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:57.880
But to do that, you need to
know where you've come from.

00:00:57.880 --> 00:01:00.960
So just very, very
quickly people

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:03.690
don't know that, actually,
whiskey distillation

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:05.250
comes from Ireland.

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:08.640
It was actually the Irish monks
who traveled around the world

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:12.040
and they saw in the Middle
East and the Mediterranean

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:14.220
the curious process
of distillation

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:17.280
using alembic stills
making essential oils,

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:19.710
making eau de vie, and they
took that technology back

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:20.440
to Ireland.

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:23.090
And we didn't have the same
crops, but what there was,

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:24.400
there was lots of barley.

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:28.110
And they soon figured out that
the resulting spirit or liquid

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:32.070
had medicinal values, and
that technology moved all

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:32.830
around the world.

00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:34.290
So it went to Scotland and
it went everywhere else.

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:35.650
But it was very
much a mom and pop.

00:01:35.650 --> 00:01:37.025
It's very, very
small production.

00:01:37.025 --> 00:01:40.410
So it literally was on
farms and really catering

00:01:40.410 --> 00:01:41.880
for the local community.

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:44.100
But a couple of
different things changed

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:46.200
from the 18th and 19th century.

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:50.132
Our family first started in
1782 in a small craft distillery

00:01:50.132 --> 00:01:51.340
in the city center of Dublin.

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:52.950
One of 40 other ones.

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:54.480
And out of these
small distilleries

00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:57.270
came the giants that really
drove the last golden era

00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:59.190
for Irish whiskey
in the 19th century

00:01:59.190 --> 00:02:02.580
when Irish whiskey dominated.

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:03.724
Much bigger than scotch.

00:02:03.724 --> 00:02:05.140
Much bigger than
American whiskey.

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:05.681
We dominated.

00:02:05.681 --> 00:02:08.460
Around 70% of all
global exports came out

00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:10.259
of the islands of Ireland.

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:13.500
And there was a reason for
that because we had, even

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:16.515
back in the 17th, 18th
century, a quality reputation.

00:02:16.515 --> 00:02:20.280
It was always seen as smooth
and very, very drinkable.

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:23.500
And one thing happened at the
start of the 19th century--

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:26.460
it was the Act of Union with the
British empire, which was not

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:30.540
so good for the country, but
great for Irish whiskey sales

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:32.040
because all of a
sudden it opened up

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:36.315
all the markets around the
world to Irish whiskey.

00:02:36.315 --> 00:02:38.410
It also led to a lot of
foreign direct investment.

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:40.350
So a lot of money
came into Ireland.

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:43.050
And at that time, Dublin
was the second richest city

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:45.930
in the whole of the British
empire, and a lot of money

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:48.739
went into whiskey
distillation, in particular.

00:02:48.739 --> 00:02:50.280
Because of the
Industrial Revolution,

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:54.720
the smaller distilleries
could become much bigger.

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:56.700
And it was quite
interesting in that when

00:02:56.700 --> 00:02:58.950
you think of distillation,
you think of rolling hills,

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:00.570
you think of lochs,
and all that.

00:03:00.570 --> 00:03:02.330
In Ireland, it was urban.

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:05.819
It was in city centers because
it was linked to the ports

00:03:05.819 --> 00:03:07.360
and it could export
around the world.

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:09.630
So it was very, very
different than what

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:10.860
was happening in Scotland.

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:13.800
Well, unfortunately,
we lost our way.

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:16.830
I think success
breeds arrogance,

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:20.190
and we didn't adapt
to modern technology,

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:23.130
and one or two other things
happened in the 20th century.

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:26.370
The War of Independence,
which was great, again,

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:29.280
for the country, but dreadful
for Irish whiskey sales

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:32.910
because it stowed away all the
routes to market that we had.

00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:36.342
And from the 1930s
to the 1990s, it

00:03:36.342 --> 00:03:37.800
was the dark days
for Irish whiskey

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:40.590
because the last big
export market was the US,

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:41.760
and they had prohibition.

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:45.640
So it was like a car crash
and we fell off a cliff,

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:48.990
and a lot of the old brands and
a lot of the old distilleries

00:03:48.990 --> 00:03:52.260
slowly slipped away.

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:56.160
And what's interesting
and what's unique, really,

00:03:56.160 --> 00:03:58.500
about our city and the city
that you guys find yourself,

00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:01.910
this is the cradle of
urban whiskey distillation.

00:04:01.910 --> 00:04:03.750
It was here in the city.

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:06.870
Because, as I said, it wasn't
these rural distilleries that

00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:08.940
were driving that golden
era, it was distilleries

00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:10.700
in the city center of Dublin.

00:04:10.700 --> 00:04:12.900
And really, in the area
called The Liberties,

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:14.820
which was outside
of the city wall.

00:04:14.820 --> 00:04:16.019
And the reason why it
was called The liberties,

00:04:16.019 --> 00:04:18.435
because you're at liberty do
whatever the hell you wanted.

00:04:18.435 --> 00:04:20.010
It was famous for manufacturing.

00:04:20.010 --> 00:04:24.450
It was for breweries, it was for
distilleries, it was for linen,

00:04:24.450 --> 00:04:26.670
and for brothels, and so forth.

00:04:26.670 --> 00:04:29.340
But the one that
stood the test of time

00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:31.090
was distilleries and breweries.

00:04:31.090 --> 00:04:35.170
And there was so much production
in one square kilometer

00:04:35.170 --> 00:04:37.740
in The Liberties, it was
called the Golden Triangle.

00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:40.350
It was where majority
of the whiskey sold

00:04:40.350 --> 00:04:44.280
in the last golden era of
Irish whiskey came from.

00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:47.980
But it was a very
dark day in 1976

00:04:47.980 --> 00:04:52.440
when the last Dublin distillery
shut its doors, when Powers

00:04:52.440 --> 00:04:54.240
shut its doors, and
all the production

00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:57.870
was consolidated down into
one distillery in Cork--

00:04:57.870 --> 00:04:59.190
in the Midleton Distillery.

00:04:59.190 --> 00:05:02.760
So from the 1976 onwards,
all the rich heritage

00:05:02.760 --> 00:05:04.860
and provenance and all
the stories and characters

00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:07.750
that were linked into
making whiskey in our city

00:05:07.750 --> 00:05:12.380
slowly slipped away,
until recently.

00:05:12.380 --> 00:05:13.670
So where are we now?

00:05:13.670 --> 00:05:15.980
We are in a new golden
era for Irish whiskey.

00:05:15.980 --> 00:05:17.572
Irish whiskey,
since the 1990s, has

00:05:17.572 --> 00:05:19.280
been the fastest
growing spirits category

00:05:19.280 --> 00:05:22.220
in the world, as a new
generation of people

00:05:22.220 --> 00:05:25.199
discover the joys
of Irish whiskey.

00:05:25.199 --> 00:05:27.740
Irish whiskey, because of our
climate and the way we make it,

00:05:27.740 --> 00:05:30.380
it's a little bit lighter, it's
a little bit more accessible,

00:05:30.380 --> 00:05:35.630
and it's a perfect gateway
spirit into whiskey in general.

00:05:35.630 --> 00:05:37.200
Everything is cyclical.

00:05:37.200 --> 00:05:40.130
So they say you don't drink
what your parents drink,

00:05:40.130 --> 00:05:43.080
but you might drink what
your grandparents drink.

00:05:43.080 --> 00:05:46.880
And it's really Irish
whiskey's chance to shine.

00:05:46.880 --> 00:05:50.360
And it's still only at the
early stages of segmentation.

00:05:50.360 --> 00:05:52.940
For years, there's only been
a handful of distilleries.

00:05:52.940 --> 00:05:55.510
So in 2012 when I set up, there
was only four distilleries.

00:05:55.510 --> 00:05:58.130
Now there there's
20 plus, and more

00:05:58.130 --> 00:05:59.670
coming very quickly behind.

00:05:59.670 --> 00:06:01.015
So it's going to change.

00:06:01.015 --> 00:06:01.890
It's going to evolve.

00:06:01.890 --> 00:06:03.140
It's going to be
a proper category

00:06:03.140 --> 00:06:05.431
with lots of different styles
and expression for people

00:06:05.431 --> 00:06:06.620
to discover.

00:06:06.620 --> 00:06:11.180
And it's hopefully going to
double from where we are now

00:06:11.180 --> 00:06:12.910
over the next 10 years.

00:06:12.910 --> 00:06:13.910
And why is it happening?

00:06:13.910 --> 00:06:16.820
It's really down to
consumer behavior.

00:06:16.820 --> 00:06:21.240
Consumer younger people, like
all your good selves here,

00:06:21.240 --> 00:06:22.910
are much more progressive.

00:06:22.910 --> 00:06:24.170
They don't stick with brands.

00:06:24.170 --> 00:06:25.830
They like to discover
something new.

00:06:25.830 --> 00:06:27.621
They want to find
something that's relevant

00:06:27.621 --> 00:06:30.230
that can connect to themselves.

00:06:30.230 --> 00:06:34.640
And they're enjoying whiskey of
every kind in different ways.

00:06:34.640 --> 00:06:37.310
Before Irish whiskey
was very much

00:06:37.310 --> 00:06:39.560
Irish coffees
around the holidays

00:06:39.560 --> 00:06:43.530
for Irish American families,
and so forth, but it's changing.

00:06:43.530 --> 00:06:44.780
It's part of a cocktail.

00:06:44.780 --> 00:06:47.660
It's being used and drunk
in many different ways.

00:06:47.660 --> 00:06:50.870
And straight, of course.

00:06:50.870 --> 00:06:54.920
And the engine for that
growth is the US market.

00:06:54.920 --> 00:06:57.590
So it was the market
that put the final nail

00:06:57.590 --> 00:07:01.190
in the coffin of Irish
whiskey at the start

00:07:01.190 --> 00:07:04.220
of the 20th century, but
it's driving, let's say,

00:07:04.220 --> 00:07:07.280
the evolution and the
revolution of the category now.

00:07:07.280 --> 00:07:10.860
It's grown way over
600% the last 10 years.

00:07:10.860 --> 00:07:13.700
But for us, the premiumization
at the higher end of the market

00:07:13.700 --> 00:07:15.450
is the one that's
growing very, very fast.

00:07:15.450 --> 00:07:16.670
But why are people drinking it?

00:07:16.670 --> 00:07:17.420
I touched on that.

00:07:17.420 --> 00:07:19.490
It's a sense of discovery.

00:07:19.490 --> 00:07:22.670
It's become part
of popular culture.

00:07:22.670 --> 00:07:24.680
But at the core is the taste.

00:07:24.680 --> 00:07:27.560
People enjoy the taste
of Irish whiskey.

00:07:27.560 --> 00:07:32.330
Our lovely, miserable, temperate
climate is good for one thing,

00:07:32.330 --> 00:07:34.130
and that's producing--
as they say,

00:07:34.130 --> 00:07:37.090
a soft climate produces a
soft whiskey, but it's true.

00:07:37.090 --> 00:07:37.590
It's true.

00:07:37.590 --> 00:07:42.140
Because if you took a
distillery that's in Ireland

00:07:42.140 --> 00:07:44.150
and you made the spirits,
but you matured it

00:07:44.150 --> 00:07:48.380
in the highlands of Scotland,
or in Kentucky, or in Taiwan,

00:07:48.380 --> 00:07:51.380
or in Japan, anywhere else,
it would be totally different.

00:07:51.380 --> 00:07:54.530
The cask and the maturation
delivers 60% to 70%

00:07:54.530 --> 00:07:55.460
of the flavor.

00:07:55.460 --> 00:07:57.890
And what's distinctive
about Irish whiskey

00:07:57.890 --> 00:08:03.140
is the temperate, soft
climate that produces limited,

00:08:03.140 --> 00:08:05.150
let's say, movement of the wood.

00:08:05.150 --> 00:08:08.907
Because oak casks are porous
and they deliver majority of it.

00:08:08.907 --> 00:08:10.240
So it's environmental influence.

00:08:10.240 --> 00:08:12.380
So when you think
of Irish whiskey,

00:08:12.380 --> 00:08:15.290
it's because we don't get
to go to the beach too often

00:08:15.290 --> 00:08:18.290
and we have to always
carry a raincoat with us,

00:08:18.290 --> 00:08:22.640
but it delivers exceptional
quality whiskey.

00:08:22.640 --> 00:08:28.679
And when I set up in 2012,
I had worked in a company

00:08:28.679 --> 00:08:29.720
called Cooley Distillery.

00:08:29.720 --> 00:08:32.650
It had been set up
by my father in 1987.

00:08:32.650 --> 00:08:35.940
It was the first new distillery
in Ireland in over 100 years,

00:08:35.940 --> 00:08:41.096
and we tried to revive a
lot of old, famous brands.

00:08:41.096 --> 00:08:43.429
And I went around the US and
all around the world trying

00:08:43.429 --> 00:08:45.470
to promote them,
and I saw for myself

00:08:45.470 --> 00:08:49.940
the emergence of craft spirits,
craft beer, people going back

00:08:49.940 --> 00:08:52.970
into urban centers to try
and make things and create

00:08:52.970 --> 00:08:56.410
brands that were relevant to the
people that live around there.

00:08:56.410 --> 00:08:58.680
And it planted a
seed in my head.

00:08:58.680 --> 00:09:01.500
And when my father decided
to sell the company

00:09:01.500 --> 00:09:06.740
he was in in 2011,
2012, [INAUDIBLE]..

00:09:06.740 --> 00:09:09.389
But it allowed me a chance to
take all these little nuggets

00:09:09.389 --> 00:09:11.180
of information and the
things that I really

00:09:11.180 --> 00:09:15.540
wanted to do and really attack
the category in my own way.

00:09:15.540 --> 00:09:20.900
And my vision was to bring a
more contemporary, more modern

00:09:20.900 --> 00:09:24.200
representation of what
Dublin and Ireland is

00:09:24.200 --> 00:09:27.140
rather than the traditional
rolling hills, red setters,

00:09:27.140 --> 00:09:31.430
and all that kind of stuff
for me, as a modern Dubliner,

00:09:31.430 --> 00:09:32.810
didn't really connect to me.

00:09:32.810 --> 00:09:36.202
And it's kind of like going
to O'Carroll's gift shop

00:09:36.202 --> 00:09:37.910
and you see all that
paddywhackery stuff.

00:09:37.910 --> 00:09:38.510
It's not real.

00:09:38.510 --> 00:09:39.620
It's not really what's going on.

00:09:39.620 --> 00:09:41.330
So I thought there
was an opportunity

00:09:41.330 --> 00:09:45.850
to represent Ireland and
Dublin in a modern way

00:09:45.850 --> 00:09:47.480
and put my own mark
on it, but do it

00:09:47.480 --> 00:09:49.584
in a way that was
very relevant to me

00:09:49.584 --> 00:09:51.500
and to go right back to
where our family first

00:09:51.500 --> 00:09:54.207
started distilling, which
was in the city of Dublin.

00:09:54.207 --> 00:09:55.540
And these are the other players.

00:09:55.540 --> 00:09:58.640
Pernod Ricard, the biggest
player by a long way.

00:09:58.640 --> 00:10:01.850
Jameson is a phenomenal
success story.

00:10:01.850 --> 00:10:04.070
Absolutely amazing.

00:10:04.070 --> 00:10:05.910
But we won't go into
that because I already

00:10:05.910 --> 00:10:07.370
talked about that.

00:10:07.370 --> 00:10:10.150
William Grant and Sons,
they own Tullamore Dew.

00:10:10.150 --> 00:10:12.070
They bought that a
good few years ago now,

00:10:12.070 --> 00:10:14.470
but they're the
largest privately owned

00:10:14.470 --> 00:10:15.910
scotch whiskey company.

00:10:15.910 --> 00:10:18.160
And Diageo, the biggest
drinks company in the world,

00:10:18.160 --> 00:10:20.030
used to own Bushmills
at the time.

00:10:20.030 --> 00:10:23.410
They subsequently flipped it
and bought a premium tequila,

00:10:23.410 --> 00:10:26.790
but they're coming
back into it as well.

00:10:26.790 --> 00:10:29.744
So the concept was to
do something different.

00:10:29.744 --> 00:10:30.910
To do something very unique.

00:10:30.910 --> 00:10:33.990
And that was to come back
to the city center of Dublin

00:10:33.990 --> 00:10:34.490
and do it.

00:10:34.490 --> 00:10:37.600
So as I said, all of it
being contemporary, urban,

00:10:37.600 --> 00:10:40.860
innovative, celebrating
my own unique provenance

00:10:40.860 --> 00:10:42.830
and doing something a
little bit different.

00:10:42.830 --> 00:10:45.038
But at the core of it was
to get back into production

00:10:45.038 --> 00:10:46.080
as soon as possible.

00:10:46.080 --> 00:10:50.367
But also, as we said, whiskey
is a very traditional category.

00:10:50.367 --> 00:10:52.200
You can't treat whiskey
like a white spirit,

00:10:52.200 --> 00:10:56.304
like a vodka or gin because of
all the history and so forth.

00:10:56.304 --> 00:10:57.720
If you look at all
the old brands,

00:10:57.720 --> 00:10:59.470
they've been around
for hundreds of years.

00:10:59.470 --> 00:11:01.170
So you're competing
against that.

00:11:01.170 --> 00:11:03.510
And the certain
consumer expectations

00:11:03.510 --> 00:11:05.040
of what it should look like.

00:11:05.040 --> 00:11:08.790
So we see ourselves as the
disruptor of Irish whiskey,

00:11:08.790 --> 00:11:10.557
but at the same
time, we're quite--

00:11:10.557 --> 00:11:12.390
you'd probably go,
you're quite traditional.

00:11:12.390 --> 00:11:14.190
Because that's
what people expect.

00:11:14.190 --> 00:11:17.844
And if you go too far, people
actually lose credibility

00:11:17.844 --> 00:11:20.010
and they think you're
overcompensating for something

00:11:20.010 --> 00:11:21.570
crap in the bottle.

00:11:21.570 --> 00:11:24.810
So what we have done
is we are, let's say,

00:11:24.810 --> 00:11:25.860
celebrating the past.

00:11:25.860 --> 00:11:28.866
We've gone with an
old style dark bottle.

00:11:28.866 --> 00:11:30.240
It's the way that
they would have

00:11:30.240 --> 00:11:32.370
been able to make glass
back in the 19th century,

00:11:32.370 --> 00:11:33.250
early 20th century.

00:11:33.250 --> 00:11:34.960
They can't make
clear white flint.

00:11:34.960 --> 00:11:36.876
They just didn't have
the capability to do it.

00:11:36.876 --> 00:11:38.787
So if you see old
bottles, you'll

00:11:38.787 --> 00:11:39.870
see they're all like this.

00:11:39.870 --> 00:11:42.600
So I have to go to Italy to
find someone that made it.

00:11:42.600 --> 00:11:45.720
But then have a stand out
label that has modern cues

00:11:45.720 --> 00:11:47.000
that people would expect.

00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:51.090
And our symbolism is a
Phoenix rising from a pot

00:11:51.090 --> 00:11:54.780
still to symbolize the revival
of distilling in the city,

00:11:54.780 --> 00:11:58.020
but also revival of our family's
involvement in the category.

00:11:58.020 --> 00:12:00.172
And our tag line is
The Spirit of Dublin.

00:12:00.172 --> 00:12:02.130
And the reason why we
say The Spirit of Dublin,

00:12:02.130 --> 00:12:04.440
it's not about
making alcohol in it,

00:12:04.440 --> 00:12:07.830
it's trying to capture
that unique DNA that makes

00:12:07.830 --> 00:12:09.720
Dublin the city that it is.

00:12:09.720 --> 00:12:10.860
It's a bit gritty.

00:12:10.860 --> 00:12:12.300
It's got its own sense of humor.

00:12:12.300 --> 00:12:14.091
It's got its good, it's
got its bad points,

00:12:14.091 --> 00:12:15.330
but it's very resilient.

00:12:15.330 --> 00:12:17.490
And there's a reason
why you guys are here.

00:12:17.490 --> 00:12:22.710
There's a reason why Google have
the European, Middle Eastern

00:12:22.710 --> 00:12:23.740
headquarters here.

00:12:23.740 --> 00:12:26.640
It's because of the people
and the environments

00:12:26.640 --> 00:12:27.630
that it creates.

00:12:27.630 --> 00:12:29.340
And I wanted to capture
that and try and put that

00:12:29.340 --> 00:12:30.798
into a bottle of
whiskey, so that's

00:12:30.798 --> 00:12:34.530
what The Spirit of
Dublin means to us.

00:12:34.530 --> 00:12:37.290
And, as you said, we're urban
distillers through the ages.

00:12:37.290 --> 00:12:41.250
So that is not what our
family distillery looked like.

00:12:41.250 --> 00:12:43.252
What actually happened
was our family distillery

00:12:43.252 --> 00:12:45.210
went through a couple of
different generations.

00:12:45.210 --> 00:12:48.690
It got subsumed into a
much larger distillery that

00:12:48.690 --> 00:12:52.891
was set up by William Jameson,
who was John Jameson's son,

00:12:52.891 --> 00:12:54.640
and became the Marrowbone
Lane Distillery.

00:12:54.640 --> 00:12:56.550
So it's the site,
but a lot smaller.

00:12:56.550 --> 00:12:59.040
And this is our new
distillery today.

00:12:59.040 --> 00:13:03.450
First new distillery in
Dublin for over 125 years.

00:13:03.450 --> 00:13:07.050
It took me nearly three years to
get it built, just for planning

00:13:07.050 --> 00:13:08.050
reasons and so forth.

00:13:08.050 --> 00:13:11.430
Even though it has all that
history and all the kind

00:13:11.430 --> 00:13:13.300
of old distilleries
based around it,

00:13:13.300 --> 00:13:16.470
and one of the biggest breweries
in the world, Guinness,

00:13:16.470 --> 00:13:18.450
it still was exceedingly
difficult to get

00:13:18.450 --> 00:13:21.166
Dublin City Council
to back me to be

00:13:21.166 --> 00:13:22.290
able to build a distillery.

00:13:22.290 --> 00:13:23.831
Because they wanted
to move industry,

00:13:23.831 --> 00:13:26.070
like manufacturing,
dirty manufacturing,

00:13:26.070 --> 00:13:27.629
as they see it, out of the city.

00:13:27.629 --> 00:13:29.670
So it was a fight in our
hands, but lucky enough,

00:13:29.670 --> 00:13:32.850
it was worth the effort to get
it because it's our brand home.

00:13:32.850 --> 00:13:34.650
And as you can
see, we like to say

00:13:34.650 --> 00:13:37.470
we fit into the
palette of materials

00:13:37.470 --> 00:13:39.090
that are famous
around The Liberties,

00:13:39.090 --> 00:13:40.298
but it's a modern distillery.

00:13:40.298 --> 00:13:42.360
We didn't want to
create a pastiche.

00:13:42.360 --> 00:13:43.950
You can't recreate history.

00:13:43.950 --> 00:13:45.224
Let's create a new history.

00:13:45.224 --> 00:13:46.640
And that's more
interesting to me,

00:13:46.640 --> 00:13:48.598
and I think that's more
interesting for people.

00:13:48.598 --> 00:13:51.420
And if you come and see
us, that's where we are.

00:13:51.420 --> 00:13:53.070
Again, New Market
Square, where we are,

00:13:53.070 --> 00:13:54.980
is part of the old
part of the city.

00:13:54.980 --> 00:13:58.270
It has so much heritage and
stories I won't go into today.

00:13:58.270 --> 00:14:02.520
But our previous family
distillery was up around there.

00:14:02.520 --> 00:14:04.980
So not too far away.

00:14:04.980 --> 00:14:06.690
But we're urban
craft distillers.

00:14:06.690 --> 00:14:09.210
And when you come to
see our distillery,

00:14:09.210 --> 00:14:10.680
the hero is manufacturing.

00:14:10.680 --> 00:14:13.910
You actually see a real
manufacturing location.

00:14:13.910 --> 00:14:16.554
It's not a visitor
center with a distillery.

00:14:16.554 --> 00:14:18.220
It's a distillery
with a visitor center.

00:14:18.220 --> 00:14:20.550
So it's a medium
sized distillery

00:14:20.550 --> 00:14:22.800
with real people making
real whiskey seven days

00:14:22.800 --> 00:14:25.670
a week, bringing back
the smells, the sounds,

00:14:25.670 --> 00:14:27.310
and the environmental
experience.

00:14:27.310 --> 00:14:31.040
And once you see it, it's
a very simple process.

00:14:31.040 --> 00:14:33.150
It's been made the same
way for hundreds of years,

00:14:33.150 --> 00:14:35.500
if not thousands of years.

00:14:35.500 --> 00:14:38.600
It's literally make a
beer, and then you distill.

00:14:38.600 --> 00:14:41.890
You actually extract
impurities, extract water,

00:14:41.890 --> 00:14:44.680
and you're left with your
spirits, which then you

00:14:44.680 --> 00:14:47.750
have to mature for
three years and a day.

00:14:47.750 --> 00:14:50.950
And what we focus on
is being different.

00:14:50.950 --> 00:14:51.820
So we're small.

00:14:51.820 --> 00:14:53.890
We're tiny.

00:14:53.890 --> 00:14:55.620
We're like-- I
wouldn't say a pimple

00:14:55.620 --> 00:14:59.326
on the arse of an elephant,
but we're quite small.

00:14:59.326 --> 00:15:00.950
Maybe our competitors
see us like that.

00:15:00.950 --> 00:15:04.120
But what we want to do is
we don't want to take away.

00:15:04.120 --> 00:15:06.470
We're not trying to rob
volume from the market.

00:15:06.470 --> 00:15:08.650
We're trying to create
choice for people.

00:15:08.650 --> 00:15:10.150
When they want to
discover something

00:15:10.150 --> 00:15:12.651
interesting within the
category, they can come to us,

00:15:12.651 --> 00:15:13.900
and hopefully we're different.

00:15:13.900 --> 00:15:15.800
Our liquid is different.

00:15:15.800 --> 00:15:18.280
We take a lot of pride in
the liquid that goes into it.

00:15:18.280 --> 00:15:20.350
Because the one thing I
learned at an early age

00:15:20.350 --> 00:15:24.340
was you got to
create a world class

00:15:24.340 --> 00:15:25.900
whiskey to get in the game.

00:15:25.900 --> 00:15:29.530
To win the game, you have to
create a world class brand.

00:15:29.530 --> 00:15:30.710
And we're working on that.

00:15:30.710 --> 00:15:32.710
We're not there yet.

00:15:32.710 --> 00:15:36.460
But we wanted to create very,
very different tasting whiskeys

00:15:36.460 --> 00:15:39.550
so that you can have any
other brand's out there,

00:15:39.550 --> 00:15:41.560
and ours will stand out,
and hopefully stand out

00:15:41.560 --> 00:15:42.899
for the right reasons.

00:15:42.899 --> 00:15:45.190
And you have to have everything
else that goes with it.

00:15:45.190 --> 00:15:49.150
So we have a premium
price versus-- let's

00:15:49.150 --> 00:15:53.260
say we're around 25%, 30%
higher than the market leader.

00:15:53.260 --> 00:15:56.256
We've differentiated packaging,
and hopefully our story

00:15:56.256 --> 00:15:57.130
is different as well.

00:15:57.130 --> 00:15:59.920
And bring it all together,
hopefully we can create

00:15:59.920 --> 00:16:00.850
something that's--

00:16:00.850 --> 00:16:02.260
as we say, a little off center.

00:16:02.260 --> 00:16:04.210
So this is our small batch.

00:16:04.210 --> 00:16:05.830
This is our flagship product.

00:16:05.830 --> 00:16:07.330
And the reason why
we went with this

00:16:07.330 --> 00:16:11.020
because 90% of Irish whiskey
sales are blended whiskey.

00:16:11.020 --> 00:16:13.390
It's a blend of grain
and malt whiskey.

00:16:13.390 --> 00:16:16.390
Grain whiskey is made
from corn or maize.

00:16:16.390 --> 00:16:18.440
It's very light.

00:16:18.440 --> 00:16:21.175
And blending it with
heavier style pot

00:16:21.175 --> 00:16:24.550
stilled or single malt makes
it more accessible, easier

00:16:24.550 --> 00:16:26.980
to drink, and it's
cheaper as well.

00:16:26.980 --> 00:16:29.364
So 90% of all Irish
whiskey sold is that type,

00:16:29.364 --> 00:16:31.030
and that's what people
expect and that's

00:16:31.030 --> 00:16:32.140
what they get used to.

00:16:32.140 --> 00:16:33.822
But we came out a
little bit different.

00:16:33.822 --> 00:16:36.030
We said, well, look, let's
treat that blended whiskey

00:16:36.030 --> 00:16:38.140
with respect and put it
in interesting barrels

00:16:38.140 --> 00:16:40.810
and treat it like it
was a single malt,

00:16:40.810 --> 00:16:42.170
and our small batch was born.

00:16:42.170 --> 00:16:44.380
So we take a grain
and malt whiskey

00:16:44.380 --> 00:16:47.530
that's been aged for around
six years in bourbon barrels,

00:16:47.530 --> 00:16:49.000
we blend it
together, and then we

00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:52.720
let it marry in rum barrels
for an extra year or so,

00:16:52.720 --> 00:16:54.610
and it imparts this
extra layer of flavor.

00:16:54.610 --> 00:16:59.530
And we bottle it at 46% or
92 proof, which captures

00:16:59.530 --> 00:17:01.030
all the natural flavors.

00:17:01.030 --> 00:17:02.590
So it dials up that
taste experience.

00:17:02.590 --> 00:17:07.510
But it tastes like what people
expect and they enjoy already.

00:17:07.510 --> 00:17:11.079
So creating a ladder of
different things to get people

00:17:11.079 --> 00:17:12.430
discovering something new.

00:17:12.430 --> 00:17:15.880
And we create a whole range
of different expressions

00:17:15.880 --> 00:17:16.420
for people.

00:17:16.420 --> 00:17:20.290
So ranging from our Spirit of
Dublin poitin, which is new

00:17:20.290 --> 00:17:21.880
make spirits straight
off the still.

00:17:21.880 --> 00:17:25.089
So it's traditionally
very strong

00:17:25.089 --> 00:17:27.069
where you only bottle
it at 55%, but it still

00:17:27.069 --> 00:17:28.119
puts hair on your chest.

00:17:28.119 --> 00:17:29.910
Doesn't put it on your
head, unfortunately.

00:17:29.910 --> 00:17:32.320
I've tried many times.

00:17:32.320 --> 00:17:36.070
To our Teeling Trinity Range,
which is our small batch,

00:17:36.070 --> 00:17:38.110
and then we break the
individual components

00:17:38.110 --> 00:17:42.940
into a bottling of single grain
whiskey and single malt. Again,

00:17:42.940 --> 00:17:46.552
using very innovative casks
to impart unique flavor.

00:17:46.552 --> 00:17:48.010
And then we're
lucky-- we have some

00:17:48.010 --> 00:17:51.070
of the oldest Irish
single malt available,

00:17:51.070 --> 00:17:53.980
and we've created a range
of different expressions

00:17:53.980 --> 00:17:55.810
all the way up to a
33-year-old, which

00:17:55.810 --> 00:17:58.810
to me is a piece of
Irish whiskey history

00:17:58.810 --> 00:18:02.110
that we're just very lucky to
be able to celebrate, and ties

00:18:02.110 --> 00:18:04.870
into celebrating the past,
while at the same time doing

00:18:04.870 --> 00:18:07.270
something different.

00:18:07.270 --> 00:18:08.830
What have we achieved?

00:18:08.830 --> 00:18:12.130
You know, it's six
years now, so better

00:18:12.130 --> 00:18:14.020
have done something by now.

00:18:14.020 --> 00:18:16.820
So we're the fastest growing
Irish whiskey domestically,

00:18:16.820 --> 00:18:18.680
which I take a lot of pride in.

00:18:18.680 --> 00:18:20.200
So to be a real
brand, you've got

00:18:20.200 --> 00:18:22.905
to be relevant to
people in your backyard

00:18:22.905 --> 00:18:25.240
and put a lot of
time and effort in.

00:18:25.240 --> 00:18:28.150
Irish whiskey 10 years
ago, no one gave a damn.

00:18:28.150 --> 00:18:30.597
It was very much focused
on bigger brands.

00:18:30.597 --> 00:18:32.680
They didn't really want
to discover anything else.

00:18:32.680 --> 00:18:34.638
But it's totally evolved,
it's totally changed.

00:18:34.638 --> 00:18:36.670
Now every bar, every
restaurant takes

00:18:36.670 --> 00:18:40.392
pride in their back bar, and
particularly Irish whiskey,

00:18:40.392 --> 00:18:42.350
Irish gin, and everything
else that's going on.

00:18:42.350 --> 00:18:45.070
So it's changed a lot,
but we're delighted to be

00:18:45.070 --> 00:18:46.870
part of that evolution.

00:18:46.870 --> 00:18:49.330
We're exporting to over
60 international markets.

00:18:49.330 --> 00:18:51.250
But it's like the 80-20 rule.

00:18:51.250 --> 00:18:55.000
The US, global travel retail,
some bigger markets like that.

00:18:55.000 --> 00:18:59.590
That drives most of our volume
and will continue to do so.

00:18:59.590 --> 00:19:03.260
We're seeding in Asia and
some emerging markets,

00:19:03.260 --> 00:19:05.200
but we're probably
a little bit more

00:19:05.200 --> 00:19:07.240
for when people already
know Irish whiskey

00:19:07.240 --> 00:19:08.698
and want to discover
something new.

00:19:08.698 --> 00:19:09.880
That's where we come in.

00:19:09.880 --> 00:19:12.940
We've won over 175 international
awards, which definitely you

00:19:12.940 --> 00:19:15.330
take a lot of pride in.

00:19:15.330 --> 00:19:19.270
And we'll continue to focus
on one bottle at a time.

00:19:19.270 --> 00:19:23.641
And we like to say-- we put
our bottling date on it.

00:19:23.641 --> 00:19:25.890
And I get to put my signature
on it because I actually

00:19:25.890 --> 00:19:29.514
have the right, the joy,
the obligation to sign off

00:19:29.514 --> 00:19:30.680
every batch before we do it.

00:19:30.680 --> 00:19:33.028
So it sounds great, but
you had a busy weekend

00:19:33.028 --> 00:19:35.236
and you come in on a Monday
morning and they're like,

00:19:35.236 --> 00:19:36.152
oh, we have to bottle.

00:19:36.152 --> 00:19:36.720
Taste this.

00:19:36.720 --> 00:19:38.910
And you're drinking
castor and whiskey.

00:19:38.910 --> 00:19:42.260
Sounds a lot more romantic
than it actually is.

00:19:42.260 --> 00:19:45.880
But it's still not a bad
job, so I can't complain.

00:19:45.880 --> 00:19:46.380
But I do.

00:19:46.380 --> 00:19:47.380
I complain all the time.

00:19:49.860 --> 00:19:53.130
We've had over 300,000 visitors
through, which is amazing,

00:19:53.130 --> 00:19:55.350
which is great, because
we don't have money

00:19:55.350 --> 00:19:57.900
for global advertising budgets.

00:19:57.900 --> 00:20:00.340
What we want is that
experiential marketing.

00:20:00.340 --> 00:20:02.640
So people to come
and experience us;

00:20:02.640 --> 00:20:06.450
meet the young, passionate
people we have working for us;

00:20:06.450 --> 00:20:08.310
understand what we're
all about; and then

00:20:08.310 --> 00:20:09.450
take that home with
them, no matter

00:20:09.450 --> 00:20:10.575
where you are in the world.

00:20:10.575 --> 00:20:11.490
So it's a key thing.

00:20:11.490 --> 00:20:13.110
And that was part
of the reason we

00:20:13.110 --> 00:20:14.568
had to fight to
get our distillery,

00:20:14.568 --> 00:20:18.340
because we wanted that
experience side of the business

00:20:18.340 --> 00:20:19.360
as well.

00:20:19.360 --> 00:20:21.775
And you'll be
delighted to know--

00:20:21.775 --> 00:20:23.400
I'm talking a lot
about the small batch

00:20:23.400 --> 00:20:25.192
and I'm talking a lot
about the distillery.

00:20:25.192 --> 00:20:26.941
We have some free
passes and some whiskeys

00:20:26.941 --> 00:20:29.190
there for you guys to take
with you so you can really

00:20:29.190 --> 00:20:32.370
experience what we're
all about as well.

00:20:32.370 --> 00:20:35.250
And where are we now in 2018?

00:20:35.250 --> 00:20:38.020
Since I started the company,
the category has doubled.

00:20:38.020 --> 00:20:40.650
Well, nearly doubled.

00:20:40.650 --> 00:20:42.630
Segmentation is accelerating.

00:20:42.630 --> 00:20:45.420
And what we had before,
we were limited by supply.

00:20:45.420 --> 00:20:46.950
Going forward from
where we are now,

00:20:46.950 --> 00:20:48.720
it's going to be
limited by demand.

00:20:48.720 --> 00:20:52.570
So it puts a lot
more onus on us to

00:20:52.570 --> 00:20:54.690
perfect our digital
marketing and other tools

00:20:54.690 --> 00:20:57.450
that we can leverage
to connect and tell

00:20:57.450 --> 00:21:02.210
our story in a meaningful way
to our target demographic.

00:21:02.210 --> 00:21:04.770
Our goal for the next
three to four years

00:21:04.770 --> 00:21:09.270
is to really be that global
discovery Irish whiskey driving

00:21:09.270 --> 00:21:11.490
the premiumization
of Irish whiskey.

00:21:11.490 --> 00:21:13.994
Not trying to be the next
Jameson, or [INAUDIBLE],,

00:21:13.994 --> 00:21:14.910
or anything like that.

00:21:14.910 --> 00:21:16.669
It's to really help
the category evolve

00:21:16.669 --> 00:21:18.960
and to give that choice so
that when you go-- no matter

00:21:18.960 --> 00:21:20.739
where you go in the
world, rather than one

00:21:20.739 --> 00:21:23.280
bottle of Irish whiskey, you'll
see a range of Irish whiskey.

00:21:23.280 --> 00:21:25.080
And that's the
opportunity, but that's

00:21:25.080 --> 00:21:27.036
the charge at the same time.

00:21:27.036 --> 00:21:28.410
And it's getting
more challenging

00:21:28.410 --> 00:21:30.300
because this is
what's happening,

00:21:30.300 --> 00:21:32.465
and there's definitely
a revolution going on.

00:21:32.465 --> 00:21:34.590
There's no shortage of
entrepreneurship in Ireland.

00:21:34.590 --> 00:21:36.339
That's the one thing
I can definitely say,

00:21:36.339 --> 00:21:38.140
is that everyone
sees the opportunity.

00:21:38.140 --> 00:21:39.900
I'm not sure if they're all
going to be able to grasp it

00:21:39.900 --> 00:21:40.399
or not.

00:21:40.399 --> 00:21:44.040
So the ones in the red were
the original distilleries

00:21:44.040 --> 00:21:47.640
from when I set up that were
there, the ones in the green

00:21:47.640 --> 00:21:51.600
are the ones that are there
now, and the ones in the black

00:21:51.600 --> 00:21:53.667
are some of the ones,
there's even more,

00:21:53.667 --> 00:21:54.750
that are going to come up.

00:21:54.750 --> 00:21:56.690
So it's very exciting.

00:21:56.690 --> 00:21:58.540
It's very noisy.

00:21:58.540 --> 00:22:00.540
Hopefully if everyone
focuses on doing something

00:22:00.540 --> 00:22:02.790
a little bit different, a
little bit more interesting,

00:22:02.790 --> 00:22:05.490
and embrace their own
story and location,

00:22:05.490 --> 00:22:07.740
the future looks
very, very bright.

00:22:07.740 --> 00:22:10.781
So [INAUDIBLE].

00:22:10.781 --> 00:22:14.120
[APPLAUSE]

00:22:17.470 --> 00:22:18.462
Am I on track?

00:22:18.462 --> 00:22:19.670
Actually, I'm ahead of track.

00:22:19.670 --> 00:22:22.989
[INAUDIBLE] loads of questions.

00:22:22.989 --> 00:22:25.030
SPEAKER 1: So Jack, thank
you so much for coming.

00:22:25.030 --> 00:22:27.330
This has been a very
interesting talk

00:22:27.330 --> 00:22:30.450
that I've witnessed as part
of the Talks at Google team.

00:22:30.450 --> 00:22:31.740
I'm not talking about whiskey.

00:22:31.740 --> 00:22:34.800
But my first question, my
very serious first question

00:22:34.800 --> 00:22:37.170
is, have you ever been
drunk on Teeling whiskey,

00:22:37.170 --> 00:22:40.110
and would you
recommend experience?

00:22:40.110 --> 00:22:42.060
JACK TEELING: Oh, my god.

00:22:42.060 --> 00:22:44.370
Well, I can tell you my
first experience with whiskey

00:22:44.370 --> 00:22:46.704
was not the best.

00:22:46.704 --> 00:22:48.870
SPEAKER 1: Was it because
it wasn't Teeling whiskey?

00:22:48.870 --> 00:22:50.730
JACK TEELING: I
didn't know how to--

00:22:50.730 --> 00:22:54.305
the problem with people who
don't maybe know whiskey

00:22:54.305 --> 00:22:56.430
and how to drink it is that
if you try and drink it

00:22:56.430 --> 00:23:00.654
like wine or beer,
you'll drink it too fast.

00:23:00.654 --> 00:23:02.320
You have to drink it
in a different way.

00:23:02.320 --> 00:23:04.014
So you sip it,
you appreciate it.

00:23:04.014 --> 00:23:05.430
So if you drink
it too fast, it'll

00:23:05.430 --> 00:23:07.170
hit you like a steam train.

00:23:07.170 --> 00:23:08.730
Unfortunately, when
I was growing up,

00:23:08.730 --> 00:23:12.070
no one told me that.

00:23:12.070 --> 00:23:12.570
Yeah.

00:23:12.570 --> 00:23:15.920
It can really knock
your socks off.

00:23:15.920 --> 00:23:18.270
We're all about drinking
less and drinking better.

00:23:18.270 --> 00:23:23.360
So it's about more
flavor, more character,

00:23:23.360 --> 00:23:25.380
and enjoying and
appreciating the whiskey,

00:23:25.380 --> 00:23:28.050
rather than drinking
it just to get drunk.

00:23:28.050 --> 00:23:31.540
But the medicinal benefits
of it are very relaxing.

00:23:31.540 --> 00:23:33.290
It's good to have--

00:23:33.290 --> 00:23:35.400
especially after a
hard week in work.

00:23:35.400 --> 00:23:36.960
It's a good way to unwind.

00:23:36.960 --> 00:23:37.789
SPEAKER 1: Yeah.

00:23:37.789 --> 00:23:39.830
So it's about drinking
less, but drinking better.

00:23:39.830 --> 00:23:41.790
JACK TEELING: Yeah.

00:23:41.790 --> 00:23:44.332
SPEAKER 1: That's very
philosophical for whiskey, no?

00:23:44.332 --> 00:23:45.540
JACK TEELING: Well, it's not.

00:23:45.540 --> 00:23:47.820
It's happened a lot in
different categories.

00:23:47.820 --> 00:23:49.230
Let's say tequila.

00:23:49.230 --> 00:23:52.020
Tequila used to be
always just a shot.

00:23:52.020 --> 00:23:53.550
Part of the experience of--

00:23:53.550 --> 00:23:56.440
I wouldn't say college
experience for people.

00:23:56.440 --> 00:23:59.970
Now if you're trying
tequila, it's all about

00:23:59.970 --> 00:24:02.460
understanding the
care and effort that

00:24:02.460 --> 00:24:04.090
goes into creating the product.

00:24:04.090 --> 00:24:06.887
And if you understand
that, you'll appreciate it

00:24:06.887 --> 00:24:09.220
a little bit more and you'll
drink it in a different way

00:24:09.220 --> 00:24:10.045
as well.

00:24:10.045 --> 00:24:10.920
SPEAKER 1: Thank you.

00:24:10.920 --> 00:24:13.640
So you definitely recommend--

00:24:13.640 --> 00:24:14.520
I just want to know.

00:24:14.520 --> 00:24:15.300
So do you recommend--

00:24:15.300 --> 00:24:16.410
JACK TEELING: I
definitely recommend

00:24:16.410 --> 00:24:18.243
drinking continuing tea
and whiskey, but not

00:24:18.243 --> 00:24:22.150
too much that you make
poor life decisions.

00:24:22.150 --> 00:24:23.610
SPEAKER 1: OK.

00:24:23.610 --> 00:24:24.450
I'm really curious.

00:24:24.450 --> 00:24:27.590
I have a question
for you as a CEO.

00:24:27.590 --> 00:24:31.200
If you could describe for us
your worst or your best day

00:24:31.200 --> 00:24:33.420
in business, what would that be?

00:24:33.420 --> 00:24:34.420
JACK TEELING: Oh, geeze.

00:24:34.420 --> 00:24:37.120
Tough question.

00:24:37.120 --> 00:24:42.060
Well, I'm lucky that we've
had some key landmark

00:24:42.060 --> 00:24:45.840
days along the journey.

00:24:45.840 --> 00:24:50.370
This year, 2018, is a
key landmark year for us

00:24:50.370 --> 00:24:54.150
as a whiskey distillery because
it's three years and a day

00:24:54.150 --> 00:24:55.890
before you can legally sell it.

00:24:55.890 --> 00:24:59.430
So we're actually bottling
up our very first release

00:24:59.430 --> 00:25:02.100
of our Teeling Single Pot still,
which will be coming available

00:25:02.100 --> 00:25:03.210
later in the year.

00:25:03.210 --> 00:25:05.400
So it's amazing to have
just a concept that you've

00:25:05.400 --> 00:25:09.990
had floating around in your head
to actually build it, lay it

00:25:09.990 --> 00:25:12.870
down, and let it mature
over that period of time,

00:25:12.870 --> 00:25:14.520
and then see it come to life.

00:25:14.520 --> 00:25:17.310
So this year is a
big year for us.

00:25:17.310 --> 00:25:19.620
But also it's like the
original five year business

00:25:19.620 --> 00:25:23.400
plan has, let's say,
happened, and now we

00:25:23.400 --> 00:25:25.630
have to reinvigorate
ourselves and go again.

00:25:25.630 --> 00:25:29.370
So all the things we want to
do-- let's get distilling back,

00:25:29.370 --> 00:25:31.699
have a range of our
whiskeys, win awards,

00:25:31.699 --> 00:25:33.240
do all that kind of
stuff like that--

00:25:33.240 --> 00:25:34.260
we've done that.

00:25:34.260 --> 00:25:37.050
So how would you
refire the organization

00:25:37.050 --> 00:25:41.770
to aspire to something bigger
again, and even myself?

00:25:41.770 --> 00:25:43.560
That was a key challenge.

00:25:43.560 --> 00:25:49.110
In terms of bad days, I always
find the worst thing is around

00:25:49.110 --> 00:25:51.150
people and sometimes
the challenges

00:25:51.150 --> 00:25:55.470
that human resources can have.

00:25:55.470 --> 00:25:57.450
Some bad decisions
I've had at hiring

00:25:57.450 --> 00:26:00.600
to be negative for the company,
and so forth, and creating

00:26:00.600 --> 00:26:04.590
not the type of environment
for staff that you want.

00:26:04.590 --> 00:26:06.960
And there were some of
the worst times for us,

00:26:06.960 --> 00:26:10.260
but that's just normal
in an organization.

00:26:10.260 --> 00:26:11.310
But still, I'm lucky.

00:26:14.005 --> 00:26:16.380
I struggle sometimes to say,
what was your worst decision

00:26:16.380 --> 00:26:18.030
or what's the worst day?

00:26:18.030 --> 00:26:21.360
Thankfully, I don't
think I've had it yet.

00:26:21.360 --> 00:26:24.840
But it's been a real positive
and enjoyable experience for me

00:26:24.840 --> 00:26:27.330
so far.

00:26:27.330 --> 00:26:29.940
SPEAKER 1: My next
question is around legacy.

00:26:29.940 --> 00:26:31.410
So you're running
the company that

00:26:31.410 --> 00:26:34.627
has had a lot of history,
a lot of family history,

00:26:34.627 --> 00:26:36.210
but at the same time
you're running it

00:26:36.210 --> 00:26:40.720
in the 21st century where things
are changing very rapidly.

00:26:40.720 --> 00:26:43.620
So how have you been able
to marry the traditional

00:26:43.620 --> 00:26:44.880
with the contemporary?

00:26:44.880 --> 00:26:49.260
So retaining your core identity,
but then also adapting it

00:26:49.260 --> 00:26:52.479
for the youngins like us?

00:26:52.479 --> 00:26:53.770
JACK TEELING: I'm not that old.

00:26:53.770 --> 00:26:54.734
SPEAKER 1: No, not you.

00:26:54.734 --> 00:26:57.630
Not you.

00:26:57.630 --> 00:26:59.480
JACK TEELING: I'm
getting older, but--

00:26:59.480 --> 00:27:03.110
I used to say our target
demographic was 21 to 35.

00:27:03.110 --> 00:27:07.380
Now it has to be 21 to 45.

00:27:07.380 --> 00:27:10.920
But I suppose in
any kind of business

00:27:10.920 --> 00:27:13.890
where your name is
on the bottle or it's

00:27:13.890 --> 00:27:16.350
gone through lots of
different generations,

00:27:16.350 --> 00:27:18.730
there's a lot of pressure
and ownership on you

00:27:18.730 --> 00:27:20.110
to represent in the right way.

00:27:20.110 --> 00:27:22.207
Not screw it up.

00:27:22.207 --> 00:27:23.790
Ours is a little bit
different in that

00:27:23.790 --> 00:27:28.990
it's really a kind of revival of
the trademark and the history.

00:27:28.990 --> 00:27:32.650
So we're a little
bit more, let's say,

00:27:32.650 --> 00:27:36.200
not as hampered by some
of the legacy issues.

00:27:36.200 --> 00:27:40.115
But what we're trying to do is
when people think of Teeling

00:27:40.115 --> 00:27:42.870
or they hear the name, they
go, oh, like the whiskey.

00:27:42.870 --> 00:27:44.670
You know, so that's
where we want to go.

00:27:44.670 --> 00:27:48.400
And I think our wider family,
which is quite a small--

00:27:48.400 --> 00:27:51.190
Teeling is an
unusual Irish name.

00:27:51.190 --> 00:27:54.299
Actually came from
Vikings, Normans, when they

00:27:54.299 --> 00:27:55.590
came to Ireland many years ago.

00:27:55.590 --> 00:27:58.007
There's more Teelings in Holland
than anywhere else, which

00:27:58.007 --> 00:28:00.339
I only found out once I set
up the company when they all

00:28:00.339 --> 00:28:02.500
kept phoning up asking for
free bottles of whiskey.

00:28:06.070 --> 00:28:09.240
I think it's an
amazing opportunity

00:28:09.240 --> 00:28:15.930
that I've been given to put our
mark back on Dublin whiskey.

00:28:15.930 --> 00:28:19.300
And hopefully it can go through
a couple different generations

00:28:19.300 --> 00:28:22.840
and carry on that
legacy to [INAUDIBLE]..

00:28:22.840 --> 00:28:25.550
SPEAKER 1: My final question--
so if you have a question,

00:28:25.550 --> 00:28:27.610
just get ready.

00:28:27.610 --> 00:28:29.560
My final question is,
when you were speaking,

00:28:29.560 --> 00:28:33.800
you said that to date you've
had about 300,000 visitors

00:28:33.800 --> 00:28:34.870
at the distillery.

00:28:34.870 --> 00:28:36.980
That's a lot of people.

00:28:36.980 --> 00:28:39.430
And you also said something
around digital marketing,

00:28:39.430 --> 00:28:43.340
on trying to adapt
for the digital age.

00:28:43.340 --> 00:28:44.470
So really quick question.

00:28:44.470 --> 00:28:46.890
Do you have an AdWords account?

00:28:46.890 --> 00:28:47.640
JACK TEELING: Yes.

00:28:47.640 --> 00:28:48.345
SPEAKER 1: OK.

00:28:48.345 --> 00:28:49.470
JACK TEELING: Very much so.

00:28:49.470 --> 00:28:51.110
Yeah.

00:28:51.110 --> 00:28:53.760
It's a key--

00:28:53.760 --> 00:28:54.884
SPEAKER 1: I'm just joking.

00:28:54.884 --> 00:28:56.565
[LAUGHTER]

00:28:56.565 --> 00:28:58.491
JACK TEELING: [INAUDIBLE].

00:28:58.491 --> 00:28:58.990
It is.

00:28:58.990 --> 00:29:02.500
Because the hardest thing is
in our industry, just so many--

00:29:02.500 --> 00:29:04.810
we don't have our
own distributors.

00:29:04.810 --> 00:29:07.420
So we have distributors,
independent distributors

00:29:07.420 --> 00:29:08.335
around the world.

00:29:08.335 --> 00:29:10.150
And it's sometimes
like Chinese whispers,

00:29:10.150 --> 00:29:11.740
but you're telling your story.

00:29:11.740 --> 00:29:13.990
And you say to them-- and
they kind of go, yeah, yeah.

00:29:13.990 --> 00:29:14.250
Oh, yeah.

00:29:14.250 --> 00:29:14.860
I understand.

00:29:14.860 --> 00:29:16.280
They've no idea what
you're talking about.

00:29:16.280 --> 00:29:17.780
And then they tell
their sales guys,

00:29:17.780 --> 00:29:20.720
who then tells the barman,
who tells then the consumer,

00:29:20.720 --> 00:29:22.270
and they kind of
lose that impact.

00:29:22.270 --> 00:29:25.780
So modern digital communication
cuts through all the noise.

00:29:25.780 --> 00:29:27.580
So someone on their
phone could find you

00:29:27.580 --> 00:29:30.330
and hopefully understand what
your product is all about

00:29:30.330 --> 00:29:31.780
and what your
brand is all about.

00:29:31.780 --> 00:29:33.863
SPEAKER 1: Thanks for
pitching AdWords back to me.

00:29:33.863 --> 00:29:37.180
I'm going to use that in
my next client meetings.

00:29:37.180 --> 00:29:38.920
Are there questions from the--

00:29:38.920 --> 00:29:39.662
oh, perfect.

00:29:39.662 --> 00:29:41.370
JACK TEELING: And the
best question, I've

00:29:41.370 --> 00:29:42.146
got a big bottle.

00:29:42.146 --> 00:29:42.770
So no pressure.

00:29:42.770 --> 00:29:44.320
SPEAKER 1: I think
I should get it.

00:29:44.320 --> 00:29:48.647
JACK TEELING: [INAUDIBLE]

00:29:48.647 --> 00:29:50.230
AUDIENCE: Since we
are here at Google,

00:29:50.230 --> 00:29:52.396
I want to know, like, which
is your favorite YouTube

00:29:52.396 --> 00:29:54.460
channel talking about whiskey?

00:29:54.460 --> 00:29:57.180
And one less thing, what do you
think about Conor McGregor's

00:29:57.180 --> 00:29:58.040
new Proper Twelve?

00:30:01.270 --> 00:30:03.970
JACK TEELING: Probably the
first one is a guy called Ralfy.

00:30:03.970 --> 00:30:05.500
I don't know if you know Ralfy.

00:30:05.500 --> 00:30:07.780
He's a serious character.

00:30:07.780 --> 00:30:10.570
And he's been doing
it for a long time.

00:30:10.570 --> 00:30:14.960
He must be out there way
before the modern interest

00:30:14.960 --> 00:30:16.540
in online reviews.

00:30:16.540 --> 00:30:18.520
And he's very
independent as well.

00:30:18.520 --> 00:30:21.770
He's Scottish, which
is a bit of an issue.

00:30:21.770 --> 00:30:24.610
So he has this warped
view of Irish whiskey,

00:30:24.610 --> 00:30:28.825
but I enjoy the way he does
and his tasting [INAUDIBLE]..

00:30:28.825 --> 00:30:32.085
AUDIENCE: Do you
remember your score?

00:30:32.085 --> 00:30:33.610
JACK TEELING:
We've got a couple.

00:30:33.610 --> 00:30:36.520
I think we did reasonably
OK on the small batch.

00:30:36.520 --> 00:30:38.350
I think he likes the
older expressions.

00:30:38.350 --> 00:30:41.502
Our single malt in particular
he gave us a good score.

00:30:41.502 --> 00:30:46.280
And then Conor McGregor
is an interesting one

00:30:46.280 --> 00:30:49.694
because he sent in his
negotiator to us a couple of--

00:30:49.694 --> 00:30:50.860
I'd say maybe two years ago.

00:30:50.860 --> 00:30:54.360
A guy called Artem Lobov,
who is The Russian Hammer.

00:30:54.360 --> 00:30:55.630
He's an MMA fighter as well.

00:30:55.630 --> 00:30:59.152
But he is a friend of
Conor, and he was looking

00:30:59.152 --> 00:31:00.360
at getting supply of whiskey.

00:31:00.360 --> 00:31:01.570
AUDIENCE: Real negotiator.

00:31:01.570 --> 00:31:02.330
JACK TEELING: Real negotiator.

00:31:02.330 --> 00:31:04.496
It was funny because he had
no knuckles on his hand.

00:31:04.496 --> 00:31:05.880
I was like, oh.

00:31:05.880 --> 00:31:07.259
He's really small.

00:31:07.259 --> 00:31:08.800
Like, you know,
maybe I can take him.

00:31:08.800 --> 00:31:11.590
And I said, not a chance.

00:31:11.590 --> 00:31:14.119
And he'd just finished
a business degree,

00:31:14.119 --> 00:31:15.910
so he was going around
doing-- so Conor has

00:31:15.910 --> 00:31:17.080
had an interest for a while.

00:31:17.080 --> 00:31:19.537
We pitched an idea of doing
a very limited, high end

00:31:19.537 --> 00:31:21.370
kind of one for him,
but he wanted something

00:31:21.370 --> 00:31:24.496
that was a little bit more
entry level to kind of go

00:31:24.496 --> 00:31:25.870
after a wider
opportunity, and it

00:31:25.870 --> 00:31:28.090
was something we couldn't do.

00:31:28.090 --> 00:31:30.190
And his launch has
been phenomenal.

00:31:30.190 --> 00:31:34.140
It's definitely generated
a lot of interest.

00:31:34.140 --> 00:31:37.060
I would be interested to see
how that interest maintains

00:31:37.060 --> 00:31:38.630
over the weekends.

00:31:38.630 --> 00:31:42.437
But I was in a taxi and he's an
MMA fighter, the taxi driver,

00:31:42.437 --> 00:31:45.020
and he said, guaranteed going
to knock out in the first round.

00:31:45.020 --> 00:31:46.570
So he's putting his
own money on it.

00:31:46.570 --> 00:31:49.090
So it could be an extra
kick for his whiskey.

00:31:49.090 --> 00:31:51.820
But I think more people
talking about Irish whiskey,

00:31:51.820 --> 00:31:57.040
it's good because it's still at
the early stages of evolution.

00:31:57.040 --> 00:32:00.609
But we do something that's
quite different than Conor.

00:32:00.609 --> 00:32:01.150
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:32:01.150 --> 00:32:02.620
Thanks first for
your presentation.

00:32:02.620 --> 00:32:03.700
Really engaging.

00:32:03.700 --> 00:32:06.397
A question around this
distillery and what

00:32:06.397 --> 00:32:07.480
you're producing in there.

00:32:07.480 --> 00:32:09.760
So I've been to this
distillery in New Market.

00:32:09.760 --> 00:32:12.430
It's a very impressive set
up of the merchandise store.

00:32:12.430 --> 00:32:15.580
Not like the paddywhack
O'Carroll's you mentioned.

00:32:15.580 --> 00:32:19.640
But showed us an Irish family of
whiskeys, and one of them I saw

00:32:19.640 --> 00:32:20.970
was poitin.

00:32:20.970 --> 00:32:23.200
So I actually went to
the launch of this.

00:32:23.200 --> 00:32:25.277
It was paired with
Poachers, an Irish gin,

00:32:25.277 --> 00:32:27.110
which I thought was
really great that you're

00:32:27.110 --> 00:32:28.820
supporting Irish business.

00:32:28.820 --> 00:32:31.160
Where do you see this in
terms of your target market,

00:32:31.160 --> 00:32:34.430
and how can this become a
drink like a cocktail or--

00:32:34.430 --> 00:32:36.680
JACK TEELING: With poitin,
or just whiskey in general?

00:32:36.680 --> 00:32:37.860
AUDIENCE: With poitin, actually.

00:32:37.860 --> 00:32:38.120
JACK TEELING: Yeah.

00:32:38.120 --> 00:32:40.780
Well, poitin is-- I've been
interested in poitin for a long

00:32:40.780 --> 00:32:42.800
time because it is--

00:32:42.800 --> 00:32:46.500
everyone in Ireland
has some story about--

00:32:46.500 --> 00:32:49.570
mostly not good-- about poitin.

00:32:49.570 --> 00:32:53.510
It always comes out at special
occasions, wakes, or stags,

00:32:53.510 --> 00:32:55.010
or all this kind
of stuff like that.

00:32:55.010 --> 00:32:57.170
Or someone has a
bottle somewhere

00:32:57.170 --> 00:33:01.265
underneath the counter in
the 7-Up or whatever sort

00:33:01.265 --> 00:33:02.592
of bottle.

00:33:02.592 --> 00:33:04.550
And I always thought it
was a great opportunity

00:33:04.550 --> 00:33:07.600
to represent in a
more modern way,

00:33:07.600 --> 00:33:11.850
but it's hard because people
don't know how to drink,

00:33:11.850 --> 00:33:14.870
and it's a bit of a novelty
because it's so strong.

00:33:14.870 --> 00:33:17.960
And you're competing
against other white spirits,

00:33:17.960 --> 00:33:21.630
be it vodka or anything else.

00:33:21.630 --> 00:33:22.940
So it's a difficult one.

00:33:22.940 --> 00:33:26.390
And we've tried it and
it's part of the portfolio,

00:33:26.390 --> 00:33:31.070
but it's-- so much money would
go into changing consumer

00:33:31.070 --> 00:33:34.490
behaviors and education that
for us, it's nice to have,

00:33:34.490 --> 00:33:36.590
put our real opportunity
is in whiskey,

00:33:36.590 --> 00:33:40.280
which people already understand
and it's a global opportunity.

00:33:40.280 --> 00:33:43.220
And there's one or
two guys like Micil

00:33:43.220 --> 00:33:46.080
which is out in Galway,
which that's what he does.

00:33:46.080 --> 00:33:49.939
He's a poitin maker
and I think he's trying

00:33:49.939 --> 00:33:51.230
to do some good things as well.

00:33:51.230 --> 00:33:53.800
But I think it would
be in cocktails

00:33:53.800 --> 00:33:56.550
and understanding
maybe a signature drink

00:33:56.550 --> 00:33:59.180
that poitin can live
in to really give it--

00:33:59.180 --> 00:34:06.230
but it's up against gin,
which, again, it's gone crazy.

00:34:06.230 --> 00:34:10.550
But I'd like to see a
future because we have a GI.

00:34:10.550 --> 00:34:12.800
So it's a geographically
protected terminology

00:34:12.800 --> 00:34:14.280
that's solely from Ireland.

00:34:14.280 --> 00:34:15.949
So it's there to
be exploited, but I

00:34:15.949 --> 00:34:18.477
would like to see a
bigger company probably do

00:34:18.477 --> 00:34:21.500
a lot of the heavy lifting to
get it to where it needs to be.

00:34:21.500 --> 00:34:23.790
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:34:23.790 --> 00:34:25.780
My question is about,
how do you start

00:34:25.780 --> 00:34:28.050
or how do you
revive a distillery,

00:34:28.050 --> 00:34:30.679
presuming that you need
to have a whiskey that's

00:34:30.679 --> 00:34:33.380
been aged for 12 years
or 15, maybe even 25?

00:34:33.380 --> 00:34:36.020
And I know you're selling
some 25-year-old whiskeys.

00:34:36.020 --> 00:34:38.659
And then in the same way, how
do you deal with competition?

00:34:38.659 --> 00:34:41.270
How do you anticipate that
people who are kids today

00:34:41.270 --> 00:34:44.570
are going to love your
whiskey in 10 or 15 years

00:34:44.570 --> 00:34:46.560
and that some other
distillery is not

00:34:46.560 --> 00:34:48.920
going to come out with
something revolutionary

00:34:48.920 --> 00:34:51.980
that you couldn't
deal with later?

00:34:51.980 --> 00:34:54.590
For example, I was thinking
how Japan entered the whiskey

00:34:54.590 --> 00:34:57.800
market in 2010 or
2014 out of the blue,

00:34:57.800 --> 00:35:00.320
and now they're kind of leading
it, getting the rewards.

00:35:00.320 --> 00:35:01.659
How do you deal with that?

00:35:01.659 --> 00:35:02.450
JACK TEELING: Yeah.

00:35:02.450 --> 00:35:04.048
I said no tough questions.

00:35:10.130 --> 00:35:12.500
We got, how do you have
whiskeys and you're

00:35:12.500 --> 00:35:14.840
only a new distillery?

00:35:14.840 --> 00:35:16.460
That's a very good question.

00:35:16.460 --> 00:35:19.977
And I was the managing director
in Cooley when it was sold.

00:35:19.977 --> 00:35:21.560
I wasn't happy when
it was being sold,

00:35:21.560 --> 00:35:22.790
so I was a little
bit problematic

00:35:22.790 --> 00:35:24.350
and I demanded the
supply contract

00:35:24.350 --> 00:35:26.510
to be able to stay within
the industry, which

00:35:26.510 --> 00:35:30.140
they gave, which was great,
so there's no non-compete.

00:35:30.140 --> 00:35:32.240
Allowed me to get back
into the category.

00:35:32.240 --> 00:35:35.360
And in 2012 and
'13, an opportunity

00:35:35.360 --> 00:35:39.090
came to buy a big chunk of
inventory, which we acted on.

00:35:39.090 --> 00:35:40.290
And so we knew quite well.

00:35:40.290 --> 00:35:43.690
But what we focus on is changing
and making it different.

00:35:43.690 --> 00:35:45.890
And by using innovative
cask maturation

00:35:45.890 --> 00:35:47.801
to bring that extra
flavor onto it

00:35:47.801 --> 00:35:49.300
And I suppose where
we're coming now

00:35:49.300 --> 00:35:54.560
is full circle where we're
replacing that source whiskey

00:35:54.560 --> 00:35:56.280
with our own whiskey now.

00:35:56.280 --> 00:35:59.030
Now it allows us to be truly
innovative and doing things

00:35:59.030 --> 00:36:00.050
differently.

00:36:00.050 --> 00:36:03.860
In terms of when we set
up, were we producing

00:36:03.860 --> 00:36:06.830
whiskeys that people would like?

00:36:06.830 --> 00:36:09.860
I suppose we were our
target demographic.

00:36:09.860 --> 00:36:11.980
It was literally the
group that was involved

00:36:11.980 --> 00:36:13.220
with opening the distillery.

00:36:13.220 --> 00:36:16.094
We sat around and said, look
what do we find interesting?

00:36:16.094 --> 00:36:16.760
What do we like?

00:36:16.760 --> 00:36:18.593
If we like it, we hope
other people like it.

00:36:18.593 --> 00:36:20.540
So we're the toughest
critics, but we

00:36:20.540 --> 00:36:23.420
make whiskeys we like to drink,
and hopefully other people

00:36:23.420 --> 00:36:25.550
like to drink it as well.

00:36:25.550 --> 00:36:28.574
And going forward, how
can we keep it relevant?

00:36:28.574 --> 00:36:29.740
How can we keep it exciting?

00:36:29.740 --> 00:36:31.010
But innovating, if you ask me.

00:36:31.010 --> 00:36:34.730
And so we're laying down
whiskeys-- peated whiskeys,

00:36:34.730 --> 00:36:38.820
smoky whiskeys, rye whiskeys--
lots of different styles

00:36:38.820 --> 00:36:41.960
so that hopefully we
can respond to consumer

00:36:41.960 --> 00:36:43.900
interest for different things.

00:36:43.900 --> 00:36:45.710
But it's global.

00:36:45.710 --> 00:36:47.330
People make whiskey everywhere.

00:36:47.330 --> 00:36:49.440
Japanese whiskey's amazing.

00:36:49.440 --> 00:36:51.230
Taiwanese whiskeys are amazing.

00:36:51.230 --> 00:36:52.710
Australian whiskey
is everywhere.

00:36:52.710 --> 00:36:55.880
So I think people are more
interested what's in the bottle

00:36:55.880 --> 00:36:58.820
rather than it necessarily has
to be from a certain country.

00:36:58.820 --> 00:37:00.770
So that puts more
pressure, but also opens up

00:37:00.770 --> 00:37:02.780
a lot of opportunities
because Irish whiskey is still

00:37:02.780 --> 00:37:03.310
quite small.

00:37:03.310 --> 00:37:04.730
It used to be only scotch.

00:37:04.730 --> 00:37:05.770
Scotch, scotch, scotch.

00:37:05.770 --> 00:37:10.370
Now it's everyone is open
to trying different things.

00:37:10.370 --> 00:37:12.860
AUDIENCE: So a lot
of whiskey ends up

00:37:12.860 --> 00:37:18.080
getting around 45% proof.

00:37:18.080 --> 00:37:20.700
There have been some really
interesting products that

00:37:20.700 --> 00:37:22.580
are typically higher in proof.

00:37:22.580 --> 00:37:24.985
So 50%, 60% cask strength.

00:37:24.985 --> 00:37:27.170
Can you talk a
little bit about how

00:37:27.170 --> 00:37:31.130
that might be a potential
direction for you,

00:37:31.130 --> 00:37:33.069
or just in the
industry in general?

00:37:33.069 --> 00:37:33.860
JACK TEELING: Yeah.

00:37:33.860 --> 00:37:36.500
I think a lot of
American whiskeys

00:37:36.500 --> 00:37:40.220
will be quite high in
alcohol, and that's, again,

00:37:40.220 --> 00:37:41.820
because of the maturation.

00:37:41.820 --> 00:37:45.260
So because they mature in very
hot climates, they actually--

00:37:45.260 --> 00:37:48.350
rather than in Ireland
where you lose alcohol

00:37:48.350 --> 00:37:50.767
into the atmosphere, you lose--

00:37:50.767 --> 00:37:52.100
SPEAKER 1: So breathing alcohol.

00:37:52.100 --> 00:37:52.460
JACK TEELING: Yeah.

00:37:52.460 --> 00:37:53.710
It's called the angel's share.

00:37:53.710 --> 00:37:56.030
It's our profit
going up in the air.

00:37:56.030 --> 00:37:58.910
So the smell you get
at a whiskey warehouse

00:37:58.910 --> 00:38:01.880
is actually alcohol
disappearing into ether.

00:38:01.880 --> 00:38:04.210
Put it's that environmental
influence that

00:38:04.210 --> 00:38:05.780
makes whiskey what it is.

00:38:05.780 --> 00:38:09.240
So in hotter climates, it
goes up rather than goes down.

00:38:09.240 --> 00:38:11.120
So the longer you have
it in wood in Ireland,

00:38:11.120 --> 00:38:12.411
the lower the alcohol strength.

00:38:12.411 --> 00:38:16.040
In America and
Taiwan, it goes up.

00:38:16.040 --> 00:38:18.560
But I think also, people
want to have a fuller

00:38:18.560 --> 00:38:20.480
flavor, a stronger
flavor, and I think

00:38:20.480 --> 00:38:22.040
people's palates can evolve.

00:38:22.040 --> 00:38:24.460
And we do a lot of
single cask bottlings.

00:38:24.460 --> 00:38:27.380
You can come to our distillery,
fill a single cask directly

00:38:27.380 --> 00:38:29.990
from the cask, and
it could be anywhere

00:38:29.990 --> 00:38:34.910
from 62% all the way down
to-- we bottled a 34-year-old

00:38:34.910 --> 00:38:36.660
and it was at 43.1%.

00:38:36.660 --> 00:38:39.460
That was the actual cask
strength coming out of it.

00:38:39.460 --> 00:38:40.920
So it just depends.

00:38:40.920 --> 00:38:43.899
And what we like to do is cater
for a full range of tastes.

00:38:43.899 --> 00:38:45.440
And when you have
the casks strength,

00:38:45.440 --> 00:38:48.250
you can add water
to it to get it to--

00:38:48.250 --> 00:38:51.350
but all our whiskeys,
our signature is 46%.

00:38:51.350 --> 00:38:53.420
And the reason why we do
that is because if you

00:38:53.420 --> 00:38:55.750
bottle at 40%, which
is the legal limit--

00:38:55.750 --> 00:38:56.540
that's the lowest.

00:38:56.540 --> 00:38:58.190
It's obviously cheaper to also.

00:38:58.190 --> 00:38:59.930
But you also have
to do a process--

00:38:59.930 --> 00:39:01.610
it's called chill filtration.

00:39:01.610 --> 00:39:05.090
Because if you don't do that,
if you get it from hot to cold,

00:39:05.090 --> 00:39:09.030
you get this clouding and little
bits of esters and fatty acids

00:39:09.030 --> 00:39:09.710
coagulating.

00:39:09.710 --> 00:39:12.337
And so you go, geeze, what's
floating in my whiskey?

00:39:12.337 --> 00:39:14.420
But if you bottle it at a
higher alcohol strength,

00:39:14.420 --> 00:39:15.295
you can keep them in.

00:39:15.295 --> 00:39:17.605
So we're trying to
bring more flavor in.

00:39:17.605 --> 00:39:19.730
And our view is, why would
you take those naturally

00:39:19.730 --> 00:39:20.929
occurring flavors out?

00:39:20.929 --> 00:39:22.970
Because they give it a
lovely, velvety mouthfeel.

00:39:22.970 --> 00:39:24.480
So we're all over that.

00:39:24.480 --> 00:39:28.331
And one of our
Brabazon bottling,

00:39:28.331 --> 00:39:30.080
which is a single malt
bottling, again, we

00:39:30.080 --> 00:39:33.697
picked 49.5% alcohol because it
delivered the best [INAUDIBLE]..

00:39:36.380 --> 00:39:37.140
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:39:37.140 --> 00:39:38.700
Thank you.

00:39:38.700 --> 00:39:42.180
My question is actually
related to trends

00:39:42.180 --> 00:39:44.710
in new product development.

00:39:44.710 --> 00:39:47.190
So you've touched
upon the competition

00:39:47.190 --> 00:39:51.600
and the big brand trying to
steal within the category.

00:39:51.600 --> 00:39:56.620
But it's also happening is cross
category, major manufacturers

00:39:56.620 --> 00:40:00.180
and small brands competing and
coming up with great ideas.

00:40:00.180 --> 00:40:03.300
Like in the UK, they've
invented the collagen

00:40:03.300 --> 00:40:06.489
based gin, which is--

00:40:06.489 --> 00:40:07.530
JACK TEELING: I saw that.

00:40:07.530 --> 00:40:07.880
That was--

00:40:07.880 --> 00:40:08.310
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:40:08.310 --> 00:40:08.950
AUDIENCE: It was.

00:40:08.950 --> 00:40:09.450
Indeed.

00:40:09.450 --> 00:40:09.950
Yes.

00:40:09.950 --> 00:40:12.270
So I'm wondering, what
is happening in whiskey?

00:40:12.270 --> 00:40:15.540
Because it's quite
traditional in terms of taste.

00:40:15.540 --> 00:40:17.610
Are there any crazy
or interesting ideas

00:40:17.610 --> 00:40:18.940
coming around?

00:40:18.940 --> 00:40:21.520
JACK TEELING: Well, because
it's such an old industry,

00:40:21.520 --> 00:40:23.350
there's lots of
rules and regulations

00:40:23.350 --> 00:40:24.690
that you have to operate within.

00:40:24.690 --> 00:40:28.200
What's interesting in Ireland
is the rules and regulations

00:40:28.200 --> 00:40:32.550
say it has to be matured
in wooden barrels for three

00:40:32.550 --> 00:40:35.860
years and a day to be
legally called Irish whiskey.

00:40:35.860 --> 00:40:38.250
But if you go to Scotland,
it's oak barrels.

00:40:38.250 --> 00:40:40.020
So what you're
seeing now is people

00:40:40.020 --> 00:40:42.539
are using different
types of wood

00:40:42.539 --> 00:40:43.830
to try and impart extra flavor.

00:40:43.830 --> 00:40:46.350
So chestnut, acacia, cherrywood.

00:40:46.350 --> 00:40:48.690
We even have experimented
with Brazilian hardwood.

00:40:48.690 --> 00:40:52.050
Sustainably
forested, I must add.

00:40:52.050 --> 00:40:54.300
And it's weird.

00:40:54.300 --> 00:40:56.546
It's just a weird
thing because it

00:40:56.546 --> 00:40:58.170
tastes like you have
a grand piano when

00:40:58.170 --> 00:40:59.340
you put your nose into it.

00:40:59.340 --> 00:41:01.080
It tastes like that.

00:41:01.080 --> 00:41:03.020
Don't ask me how, but it does.

00:41:03.020 --> 00:41:04.250
It's really weird.

00:41:04.250 --> 00:41:06.840
But you can do that.

00:41:06.840 --> 00:41:08.670
What we are doing a
lot of is collaborating

00:41:08.670 --> 00:41:10.260
with other spirits producers.

00:41:10.260 --> 00:41:13.350
Be it craft breweries,
other spirits producers.

00:41:13.350 --> 00:41:19.470
So we've casks that would have
been used for aquavit, for gin,

00:41:19.470 --> 00:41:24.990
for vermouth, for craft beer,
for anything you can imagine.

00:41:24.990 --> 00:41:27.480
You can do it because that
imparts a certain flavor

00:41:27.480 --> 00:41:30.570
into the barrel that you can
then extract into the whiskey.

00:41:30.570 --> 00:41:34.622
You can't add any flavorings,
like natural flavorings

00:41:34.622 --> 00:41:36.080
or anything like
that, otherwise it

00:41:36.080 --> 00:41:37.730
can't be classified as whiskey.

00:41:37.730 --> 00:41:40.920
But you can basically
use a wooden vessel

00:41:40.920 --> 00:41:43.770
that has been used to age
or mature something else.

00:41:43.770 --> 00:41:46.980
And we do a lot with different
types of wines and stuff

00:41:46.980 --> 00:41:47.530
like that.

00:41:47.530 --> 00:41:49.320
So we're innovating
where we can.

00:41:49.320 --> 00:41:52.780
And also you can
innovate how you

00:41:52.780 --> 00:41:56.250
want raw materials used and
even the yeast strains you use.

00:41:56.250 --> 00:41:58.230
So we're using a
combination of white wine

00:41:58.230 --> 00:41:59.730
yeast and traditional
[INAUDIBLE]

00:41:59.730 --> 00:42:03.570
to produce a very
flavorsome base

00:42:03.570 --> 00:42:06.270
that you make your spirit from.

00:42:06.270 --> 00:42:07.560
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:42:07.560 --> 00:42:11.310
So you mentioned how
your challenges so far

00:42:11.310 --> 00:42:14.160
have been supply
based challenges,

00:42:14.160 --> 00:42:16.710
but they're now moving more
towards the demand side.

00:42:16.710 --> 00:42:20.070
So I'm guessing that
you are thinking

00:42:20.070 --> 00:42:23.970
about how to increase
demand, and one way to do

00:42:23.970 --> 00:42:26.290
that is by scaling globally.

00:42:26.290 --> 00:42:27.630
So I'm just curious.

00:42:27.630 --> 00:42:32.610
How do you maintain a local
brand and make that go global?

00:42:32.610 --> 00:42:36.810
Like, how do you stay
quintessentially Irish and true

00:42:36.810 --> 00:42:38.300
to your heritage?

00:42:38.300 --> 00:42:41.640
Because this is a business
that has been inherited, right?

00:42:41.640 --> 00:42:46.200
So how do you stay true to that
while having a global appeal?

00:42:46.200 --> 00:42:47.100
JACK TEELING: Yeah.

00:42:47.100 --> 00:42:50.220
That's a very good question.

00:42:50.220 --> 00:42:52.980
Like you guys know THE
local type of approach,

00:42:52.980 --> 00:42:56.157
in terms of what we
do here in Dublin.

00:42:56.157 --> 00:42:57.990
The different things
we do to try and engage

00:42:57.990 --> 00:42:59.640
with local communities.

00:42:59.640 --> 00:43:05.400
We try and foster a similar type
of behavior from our importers

00:43:05.400 --> 00:43:09.150
around the world to
bring the brand to life.

00:43:09.150 --> 00:43:13.572
So at the core, we
are definitely Irish

00:43:13.572 --> 00:43:14.280
and we're Dublin.

00:43:14.280 --> 00:43:15.960
And sometimes you
go around the world,

00:43:15.960 --> 00:43:17.168
they don't understand Dublin.

00:43:19.560 --> 00:43:21.851
You go to New York
and they still

00:43:21.851 --> 00:43:24.100
think there's, like, donkeys
going through the streets

00:43:24.100 --> 00:43:24.460
and stuff like that.

00:43:24.460 --> 00:43:25.240
No, no, no.

00:43:28.050 --> 00:43:29.300
It's a challenge.

00:43:29.300 --> 00:43:30.580
It is a challenge.

00:43:30.580 --> 00:43:33.960
And it's easy if you
live here to understand

00:43:33.960 --> 00:43:35.490
what the city is like.

00:43:35.490 --> 00:43:38.670
To try and capture
that in an emotive way

00:43:38.670 --> 00:43:41.650
and to bring us internationally,
it's a challenge.

00:43:41.650 --> 00:43:45.590
And I wouldn't say we've cracked
it, but we're working on it.

00:43:45.590 --> 00:43:48.090
What we do is we have
Irish people that we've

00:43:48.090 --> 00:43:50.250
sent around the world
to represent the brand

00:43:50.250 --> 00:43:51.680
to bring it to life.

00:43:51.680 --> 00:43:52.790
Brand ambassadors.

00:43:52.790 --> 00:43:54.540
Whiskey warriors, as
we like to call them,

00:43:54.540 --> 00:43:56.280
because they're at
the coalface fighting

00:43:56.280 --> 00:43:59.750
to go battle to spread the
gospel of all things Teeling.

00:43:59.750 --> 00:44:02.490
And that's going into probably
the right type of accounts

00:44:02.490 --> 00:44:04.720
where people take pride
in what they sell.

00:44:04.720 --> 00:44:06.270
They want to learn.

00:44:06.270 --> 00:44:08.310
And then they can tell
your story for you.

00:44:08.310 --> 00:44:12.360
So it's an ongoing battle.

00:44:12.360 --> 00:44:14.320
AUDIENCE: Increasingly,
purchasing whiskey

00:44:14.320 --> 00:44:15.910
is being driven by
investment decision

00:44:15.910 --> 00:44:17.820
rather than for consumption.

00:44:17.820 --> 00:44:20.970
And a couple of days
ago, there was an article

00:44:20.970 --> 00:44:23.220
going viral about
the Macallan selling

00:44:23.220 --> 00:44:25.500
for nearly a million euro.

00:44:25.500 --> 00:44:27.150
I was wondering,
for people like us

00:44:27.150 --> 00:44:31.860
who can hold whiskey for
another 30, 40 years at least,

00:44:31.860 --> 00:44:33.420
what sort of
recommendation would you

00:44:33.420 --> 00:44:35.265
have in terms of
what type of whiskey

00:44:35.265 --> 00:44:36.380
we should be purchasing?

00:44:36.380 --> 00:44:37.760
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:44:37.760 --> 00:44:38.340
JACK TEELING: Have
you all signed

00:44:38.340 --> 00:44:39.519
disclosures in this on one?

00:44:39.519 --> 00:44:40.560
I don't know [INAUDIBLE].

00:44:40.560 --> 00:44:42.480
AUDIENCE: And perhaps
just to relate back

00:44:42.480 --> 00:44:45.810
to your company, is there
any specific type of Teeling

00:44:45.810 --> 00:44:47.280
whiskey that maybe we should--

00:44:47.280 --> 00:44:52.360
or you would envisage surging
in price going forward?

00:44:52.360 --> 00:44:55.080
JACK TEELING: I always
encourage people to at least buy

00:44:55.080 --> 00:44:57.580
two bottles so they can drink
one and collect the other one.

00:44:57.580 --> 00:45:02.820
But at the core of our range,
we make whiskeys to be drunk.

00:45:02.820 --> 00:45:04.890
Whiskey is, for me--

00:45:04.890 --> 00:45:07.050
it's enjoyed with social.

00:45:07.050 --> 00:45:08.680
Buy it, open, and drink it.

00:45:08.680 --> 00:45:11.070
And we've positioned
our core range

00:45:11.070 --> 00:45:14.900
so that it wouldn't gather dust
in people's drinks cabinets.

00:45:14.900 --> 00:45:17.580
It's an affordable luxury.

00:45:17.580 --> 00:45:20.410
So at the core, that's
what we're all about.

00:45:20.410 --> 00:45:25.510
But as a category, Irish
whiskey is booming.

00:45:25.510 --> 00:45:27.430
It's growing ahead of
everyone's expectations.

00:45:27.430 --> 00:45:30.360
So the ability to
sell older expressions

00:45:30.360 --> 00:45:32.780
is going to become more limited.

00:45:32.780 --> 00:45:36.270
And as more and more
collectors come in,

00:45:36.270 --> 00:45:37.937
there's going to be
a high appreciation.

00:45:37.937 --> 00:45:39.686
And what we're seeing
is a lot of interest

00:45:39.686 --> 00:45:41.250
in the newer
distilleries like Dingle

00:45:41.250 --> 00:45:42.540
and older things like that.

00:45:42.540 --> 00:45:45.479
People are just buying to sell
on, and it seems to be working.

00:45:45.479 --> 00:45:48.020
But is it a house of cards that
they're selling to each other

00:45:48.020 --> 00:45:49.103
and it's going to implode?

00:45:49.103 --> 00:45:50.310
I don't know.

00:45:50.310 --> 00:45:52.650
But I think anything
that has-- it's

00:45:52.650 --> 00:45:55.230
like a bit of liquid history.

00:45:55.230 --> 00:45:58.930
And some of the older
expressions, I would expect--

00:45:58.930 --> 00:46:02.370
I can't guarantee-- that they
should appreciate in value

00:46:02.370 --> 00:46:05.490
as more and more collectors
come into the category

00:46:05.490 --> 00:46:06.780
as it gets bigger.

00:46:06.780 --> 00:46:08.470
So still at the early stages.

00:46:08.470 --> 00:46:09.990
I remember 5, 10
years ago, no one

00:46:09.990 --> 00:46:11.660
really collected Irish whiskey.

00:46:11.660 --> 00:46:14.400
Now you go online and there's
massive communities that

00:46:14.400 --> 00:46:16.110
are all talking about
it, but still small

00:46:16.110 --> 00:46:18.540
relative to Scotch or Japanese.

00:46:18.540 --> 00:46:22.440
And we auctioned off
our very first release

00:46:22.440 --> 00:46:24.480
from the distillery on
whiskeyauctioneer.com,

00:46:24.480 --> 00:46:25.410
a Scottish one.

00:46:25.410 --> 00:46:27.659
And we did it because we
wanted to achieve the highest

00:46:27.659 --> 00:46:30.270
price so we could give
all the proceeds back

00:46:30.270 --> 00:46:32.400
to local charities.

00:46:32.400 --> 00:46:34.860
So give something back.

00:46:34.860 --> 00:46:37.770
And our bottle number one, which
is a three-year-old whiskey,

00:46:37.770 --> 00:46:41.430
sold for 10,000 pounds sterling,
which I thought was great.

00:46:41.430 --> 00:46:44.130
But on average, they went
for 600 pounds as well.

00:46:44.130 --> 00:46:46.800
But that's a once off,
never to be repeated.

00:46:46.800 --> 00:46:48.835
Our commercial release
of our single pot

00:46:48.835 --> 00:46:51.520
still will be coming out
in October, November.

00:46:51.520 --> 00:46:54.170
Batch one will be priced
hopefully reasonably enough.

00:46:54.170 --> 00:46:56.310
Around 50, 55 euros.

00:46:56.310 --> 00:46:58.080
So again, drinkable.

00:46:58.080 --> 00:47:00.360
But if you were to
put away a bottle,

00:47:00.360 --> 00:47:01.518
I would recommend that one.

00:47:04.032 --> 00:47:05.490
SPEAKER 1: Thank
you so much, Jack.

00:47:05.490 --> 00:47:07.560
I never knew, like,
coming to a whiskey talk,

00:47:07.560 --> 00:47:09.060
I would take away
a nugget for life.

00:47:09.060 --> 00:47:11.021
Drink less, drink better.

00:47:11.021 --> 00:47:11.520
Yeah.

00:47:11.520 --> 00:47:14.160
So do less, do better.

00:47:14.160 --> 00:47:17.714
Just anything
less, do it better.

00:47:17.714 --> 00:47:20.130
JACK TEELING: I cannot choose
who asked the best question.

00:47:20.130 --> 00:47:21.463
Going to have leave that to you.

00:47:21.463 --> 00:47:22.650
SPEAKER 1: Yay!

00:47:22.650 --> 00:47:23.970
[APPLAUSE]

00:47:23.970 --> 00:47:26.250
Thank you so much, guys.

00:47:26.250 --> 00:47:27.930
Thank you.

00:47:27.930 --> 00:47:28.780
Thank you, Jack.

00:47:28.780 --> 00:47:30.630
Thank you.
