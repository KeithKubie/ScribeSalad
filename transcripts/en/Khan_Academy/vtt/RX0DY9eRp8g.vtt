00:00:00.634 --> 00:00:02.894
Voiceover:In Johannesburg
in June, the daily low

00:00:02.894 --> 00:00:05.588
temperature is usually
around 3 degrees Celsius

00:00:05.588 --> 00:00:09.208
and the daily high temperature
is around 18 degrees Celsius.

00:00:09.208 --> 00:00:11.489
The temperature is typically
halfway between the

00:00:11.489 --> 00:00:16.232
daily high and the daily low
at both 10 a.m. and 10 p.m.

00:00:16.232 --> 00:00:18.923
and the highest temperatures
are in the afternoon.

00:00:18.923 --> 00:00:21.517
Write a trigonometric
function that models the

00:00:21.517 --> 00:00:25.847
temperature capital T in
Johannesburg lowercase t

00:00:25.847 --> 00:00:28.218
hours after midnight.

00:00:28.218 --> 00:00:30.470
So let's see if we can
start to think about

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:33.152
what a graph might look
like of all of this.

00:00:33.376 --> 00:00:35.866
So this, let's say this
is our temperature axis

00:00:35.866 --> 00:00:37.821
in Celsius degrees.

00:00:37.821 --> 00:00:41.065
So that is temperature,
temperature, and I'm

00:00:41.065 --> 00:00:43.313
actually going to first, I'm going
to do two different functions.

00:00:43.989 --> 00:00:45.986
So that's my temperature axis.

00:00:45.986 --> 00:00:50.935
And this right over here
is my time in hours.

00:00:51.534 --> 00:00:56.855
So, that's lower case t, time in hours and

00:00:56.855 --> 00:00:59.460
lets think about the
range of temperatures.

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:02.867
So the daily low temperature
is around 3 degrees Celsius.

00:01:03.205 --> 00:01:05.201
So lets actually, and
the high is 18, so lets

00:01:05.201 --> 00:01:09.060
make this right over
here 18, this right over

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:12.487
here is 3 and we can also think about the

00:01:12.487 --> 00:01:15.119
midpoint between 18 and
3 that we hit at both

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:16.879
10 a.m. and 10 p.m.

00:01:16.879 --> 00:01:20.318
18 plus 3 is 21 divided by 2 is 10.5.

00:01:21.025 --> 00:01:23.899
So the midpoint, or we can
say the mid line of our

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:28.410
trigonometric function is going
to be 10.5 degrees Celsius.

00:01:29.301 --> 00:01:31.783
Let me draw the mid line.

00:01:31.783 --> 00:01:33.775
So we're going to
essentially oscillate around

00:01:33.775 --> 00:01:37.572
this right over here, we're
going to oscillate around this.

00:01:37.572 --> 00:01:40.807
The daily high is around
18 degrees Celsius.

00:01:41.268 --> 00:01:43.557
The daily high is around
18 degrees Celsius

00:01:43.557 --> 00:01:45.717
and the daily low is around 3 degrees,

00:01:45.717 --> 00:01:49.039
3 degrees Celsius, just like that.

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:50.857
So we're going to oscillate
around this mid line.

00:01:50.857 --> 00:01:54.270
We're going to hit the lows and the highs.

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:58.155
Now to simplify things
because we hit this 10.5

00:01:58.155 --> 00:02:01.752
degrees at 10 a.m. and
10 p.m., to simplify this

00:02:01.752 --> 00:02:04.350
I'm not going to tackle
their question that they

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:07.826
want immediately, the hour in
terms of t hours after midnight.

00:02:07.826 --> 00:02:09.979
I'm going to define a new function.

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:15.144
F of t, F of lowercase
t which is equal to the

00:02:15.144 --> 00:02:19.488
temperature, temperature
in Johannesburg, we're

00:02:19.488 --> 00:02:21.649
assuming everything is in Johannesburg.

00:02:21.649 --> 00:02:27.573
Temperature t hours
after, I'm going to say

00:02:27.573 --> 00:02:29.108
t hours after 10 a.m.

00:02:29.108 --> 00:02:30.612
The reason why I'm picking
10 a.m. is because we

00:02:30.612 --> 00:02:34.275
know that the temperature is
right at the mid line at 10 a.m.

00:02:34.275 --> 00:02:37.910
t hours after 10 a.m.

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:41.798
Because if I want a graph
F of t at t equals zero

00:02:41.798 --> 00:02:44.391
that means we're at 10
a.m., that means that we're

00:02:44.391 --> 00:02:47.305
halfway between, they tell
us, we're halfway between

00:02:47.305 --> 00:02:49.606
the daily low and the daily high.

00:02:49.606 --> 00:02:51.639
Now what is the period of this

00:02:51.639 --> 00:02:53.478
trigonometric function going to be?

00:02:53.478 --> 00:02:58.544
Well after 24 hours
we're back to 10 am, so

00:02:58.544 --> 00:03:01.063
our period is going to be 24 hours.

00:03:01.063 --> 00:03:03.212
So we put 24 hours there and then

00:03:03.212 --> 00:03:05.683
this is, halfway is 12 hours.

00:03:05.683 --> 00:03:07.275
So what happens after 12 hours?

00:03:07.275 --> 00:03:09.313
After 12 hours we're back at 10 p.m.

00:03:10.159 --> 00:03:14.426
where we're back at midway
between our lows and our highs.

00:03:14.426 --> 00:03:17.448
And then after 24 hours
we're back at 10 a.m. again

00:03:17.448 --> 00:03:20.505
so those are going to be points on F of t.

00:03:20.505 --> 00:03:22.521
And now lets think about
what will happen as we

00:03:22.521 --> 00:03:25.333
go beyond, as we start at
10 a.m. and go forward.

00:03:25.333 --> 00:03:27.420
So as we start at 10 a.m.
and go forward they tell

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:31.121
us that the hottest part,
the highest temperatures

00:03:31.121 --> 00:03:32.389
are in the afternoon.

00:03:32.389 --> 00:03:35.564
The afternoon is going to be around here.

00:03:35.564 --> 00:03:39.239
So we should be going up
in temperature and the

00:03:39.239 --> 00:03:41.095
highest point is actually
going to be halfway

00:03:41.095 --> 00:03:43.703
between these two so
it's going to be 6 hours

00:03:43.703 --> 00:03:46.180
after 10 a.m. which is 4 p.m. so that's

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:48.699
going to be the high at 4 p.m.

00:03:48.699 --> 00:03:53.113
So let me draw a curve,
draw our curve like this.

00:03:53.113 --> 00:03:56.364
So it'll look like this.

00:03:56.364 --> 00:03:59.765
And then our low, so
now we're at 10 p.m. and

00:03:59.765 --> 00:04:02.446
then you go 6 hours
after 10 p.m. you're now

00:04:02.446 --> 00:04:05.081
at 4 a.m. which is going to be the low.

00:04:05.081 --> 00:04:09.856
This is 18 hours after
10 a.m. you're going to

00:04:09.856 --> 00:04:13.159
be at your low temperature,
roughly right over there.

00:04:13.159 --> 00:04:18.962
And your curve will look
something like this.

00:04:18.962 --> 00:04:22.371
So what would be, before we
even try to model T of t,

00:04:22.371 --> 00:04:24.670
what would be an
expression, and obviously we

00:04:24.670 --> 00:04:29.182
keep going like that we can
even go hours before 10 a.m.

00:04:29.182 --> 00:04:33.465
This is obviously, just keeps
on cycling on and on forever.

00:04:33.465 --> 00:04:36.278
Now, what would be an
expression for F of t and I

00:04:36.278 --> 00:04:37.756
encourage you once
again to pause the video

00:04:37.756 --> 00:04:39.866
and try to think about that.

00:04:39.866 --> 00:04:42.175
Well, one thing that you
say, well this could be

00:04:42.175 --> 00:04:44.078
a sine or a co-sine
function, actually you could

00:04:44.078 --> 00:04:46.195
model it with either
of them but it's always

00:04:46.195 --> 00:04:47.846
easiest to do the simplest one.

00:04:47.846 --> 00:04:51.729
Which function is
essentially at it's midline

00:04:53.282 --> 00:04:56.745
when the argument to the function is zero.

00:04:56.745 --> 00:04:59.651
Well the sine of zero is
zero and if we didn't shift

00:04:59.651 --> 00:05:02.063
this function up or down
the mid line of just

00:05:02.063 --> 00:05:05.975
a sine function, without
it being shifted, is zero.

00:05:05.975 --> 00:05:08.056
So sine of zero, zero and then sine begins

00:05:08.056 --> 00:05:09.972
to increase and oscillate like this.

00:05:09.972 --> 00:05:16.626
So it feels like sine is a good
candidate to model it with.

00:05:16.626 --> 00:05:18.248
Once again you could
model it with either but

00:05:18.248 --> 00:05:20.313
I have a feeling that this is
going to be a little bit simpler.

00:05:20.313 --> 00:05:21.920
Now lets think about the amplitude.

00:05:21.920 --> 00:05:23.848
Well how much do we
vary, what's our maximum

00:05:23.848 --> 00:05:25.685
variance from our mid line?

00:05:25.685 --> 00:05:28.851
So here we are 7.5 above our mid line.

00:05:29.343 --> 00:05:32.761
Here we are 7.5 below our mid line.

00:05:32.761 --> 00:05:36.461
So our amplitude is
7.5 and actually let me

00:05:36.461 --> 00:05:38.022
just do that in a different
color just so you see

00:05:38.022 --> 00:05:39.846
where things are coming from.

00:05:39.846 --> 00:05:45.235
So this is 7.5, this is
7.5, so our amplitude

00:05:45.235 --> 00:05:47.838
looks like it's 7.5.

00:05:47.838 --> 00:05:49.945
And now, what is our period?

00:05:49.945 --> 00:05:52.252
Well we've already talked
about it, our period

00:05:52.252 --> 00:05:55.885
is 24, 24 hours.

00:05:55.885 --> 00:05:57.715
This distance right over
here is 24 hours which

00:05:57.715 --> 00:05:59.492
makes completes sense,
after 24 hours you're

00:05:59.492 --> 00:06:01.438
at the same point in the day.

00:06:01.438 --> 00:06:05.672
So we would divide 2 pie by the period,

00:06:05.672 --> 00:06:08.216
divided by 24 times t.

00:06:08.216 --> 00:06:10.465
And if you forget, hey
you know divide 2 pie by

00:06:10.465 --> 00:06:14.507
the period here, you could
just remind yourself that

00:06:14.507 --> 00:06:18.393
what t value will make
us go from, so when t

00:06:18.393 --> 00:06:20.742
is equal to zero the
whole argument to the sine

00:06:20.742 --> 00:06:23.601
function is going to be zero,
that's when we're over here.

00:06:23.601 --> 00:06:27.037
And then when t is equal
to 24 the whole argument

00:06:27.037 --> 00:06:28.037
is going to be 2 pie.

00:06:28.037 --> 00:06:30.141
So we would have made one
rotation around the unit

00:06:30.141 --> 00:06:32.950
circle if you think about the
input into the sine function.

00:06:33.256 --> 00:06:34.890
Now we're almost done.

00:06:34.890 --> 00:06:36.457
If I were to just graph
this, this would be,

00:06:37.210 --> 00:06:39.845
have a mid line around
zero but we see that we've

00:06:39.845 --> 00:06:45.207
shifted everything up by 10.5.

00:06:45.207 --> 00:06:49.676
So we have to shift everything up by 10.5.

00:06:49.676 --> 00:06:53.466
Now, this is, we've just
successfully modeled it

00:06:53.466 --> 00:06:55.121
and we could simplify a
little bit we could write

00:06:55.121 --> 00:06:57.646
this as pie over 12
instead of 2 pie over 24.

00:06:57.646 --> 00:07:00.063
But this right over here
models the temperature

00:07:00.063 --> 00:07:06.835
in Johannesburg, t hours
after 10 a.m., after 10 a.m.

00:07:06.835 --> 00:07:09.345
That's not what they wanted,
they want us to model

00:07:10.437 --> 00:07:15.218
the temperature t hours after midnight.

00:07:15.218 --> 00:07:17.106
So what would T of t be?

00:07:17.106 --> 00:07:19.114
We're going to have to
shift this a little bit.

00:07:19.114 --> 00:07:21.603
So lets just think about it a little
bit, let me just write it out.

00:07:21.603 --> 00:07:28.035
So T of t, this is now,
we're modeling t hours

00:07:28.035 --> 00:07:30.920
after, after midnight.

00:07:30.920 --> 00:07:33.106
So we're going to have
this same amplitude.

00:07:33.106 --> 00:07:35.414
We're still going to have the
same variance from the mid line.

00:07:35.414 --> 00:07:41.119
So it's going to be 7.5
times sine of, I should

00:07:41.119 --> 00:07:42.432
be doing it in the same color so you see

00:07:42.432 --> 00:07:44.181
what I'm changing and not changing.

00:07:44.181 --> 00:07:49.185
Times the sine of,
instead of 2 pie over 24

00:07:49.185 --> 00:07:53.409
I'll just write pie over
12, instead of writing t

00:07:53.409 --> 00:07:56.450
I'm going to shift t,
either to the right or left.

00:07:56.450 --> 00:07:57.742
Actually you can shift in
either direction because

00:07:57.742 --> 00:07:59.570
this is a periodic function
we're going to have to

00:07:59.570 --> 00:08:01.452
think about how much we're shifting it.

00:08:01.452 --> 00:08:05.239
So t is going to be plus or
minus something right over here.

00:08:05.239 --> 00:08:08.784
I'm going to shift it, plus 10.5.

00:08:08.784 --> 00:08:13.159
Plus 10.5, now this is
always a little bit, at

00:08:13.159 --> 00:08:14.583
least in my brain I have
to think about this in

00:08:14.583 --> 00:08:16.335
a lot of different ways
so that I can make sure

00:08:16.335 --> 00:08:18.187
that I'm shifting it
in the right direction.

00:08:18.187 --> 00:08:21.484
So here at 10 a.m. we were at this point.

00:08:21.484 --> 00:08:25.014
When t is equal to zero, this
is zero hours after 10 a.m.

00:08:25.014 --> 00:08:26.987
But in this function when is 10 a.m.

00:08:27.771 --> 00:08:30.947
Well in this function 10 a.m.,
let me write it this way.

00:08:30.947 --> 00:08:33.740
10 a.m. is ten hours after midnight.

00:08:33.740 --> 00:08:39.365
So T, capital T of 10, this
is 10 hours after midnight

00:08:39.365 --> 00:08:46.938
should be equal to F of
zero because here the

00:08:46.938 --> 00:08:50.010
argument is hours after
10 a.m. so this is 10 a.m.

00:08:50.010 --> 00:08:52.837
this right over here
represents temperature,

00:08:52.837 --> 00:08:58.892
temperature at 10 a.m.
and this over here, cause

00:08:58.892 --> 00:09:01.984
capital T function, this
is hours after midnight.

00:09:01.984 --> 00:09:06.709
This is also temperature at 10 a.m.

00:09:06.709 --> 00:09:11.065
So we want T of 10 to be
the same thing as F of zero.

00:09:11.065 --> 00:09:13.858
Or another way of thinking
about it, when F of zero,

00:09:13.858 --> 00:09:15.747
this whole argument is zero.

00:09:15.747 --> 00:09:19.050
So we want this whole
argument to be zero when

00:09:19.050 --> 00:09:21.850
T is equal to 10.

00:09:21.850 --> 00:09:23.124
So how would we do that?

00:09:23.124 --> 00:09:27.078
Well this is t minus 10,
notice T of 10, you put

00:09:27.078 --> 00:09:29.215
a 10 here this whole thing becomes a zero.

00:09:29.215 --> 00:09:30.887
This whole thing becomes
zero and you're left

00:09:30.887 --> 00:09:34.581
with 10.5 and over here F
of zero well the same thing,

00:09:34.581 --> 00:09:36.602
this whole thing becomes
a zero and all you're left

00:09:36.602 --> 00:09:38.426
with over here is 10.5.

00:09:38.426 --> 00:09:41.399
So T of 10 should be F of zero.

00:09:41.399 --> 00:09:42.725
So if we wanted to graph it, we've already

00:09:42.725 --> 00:09:43.590
answered their question.

00:09:43.590 --> 00:09:46.299
If we put a 10 here,
the argument to the sine

00:09:46.299 --> 00:09:48.581
becomes zero, these two things
are going to be equivalent.

00:09:48.581 --> 00:09:50.714
But lets actually graph this.

00:09:50.714 --> 00:09:54.736
So T of 10, so if we're
graphing capital T, T of 10

00:09:54.736 --> 00:09:58.593
so this is 6, 12 lets
see so this is maybe,

00:09:58.593 --> 00:10:02.262
so 10 is going to be
someplace around here.

00:10:02.262 --> 00:10:05.327
So T of 10 is going to be
the same thing as F of zero.

00:10:05.327 --> 00:10:07.841
So it's going to be like
that and then it's just

00:10:07.841 --> 00:10:10.497
going to, and then we've
essentially just shifted

00:10:10.497 --> 00:10:15.785
everything to the right,
everything to the right by 10.

00:10:15.785 --> 00:10:19.259
That makes sense because
zero after whatever hours

00:10:19.259 --> 00:10:22.337
you are after 10 a.m. is
going to be 10 more hours

00:10:22.337 --> 00:10:25.190
to get to that same point after midnight.

00:10:25.190 --> 00:10:27.472
So your curve is going
to look, so this is going

00:10:27.472 --> 00:10:29.915
to be shifted by 10, this
is going to be shifted

00:10:29.915 --> 00:10:32.505
by 10 and your curve is
going to look something

00:10:32.505 --> 00:10:35.169
like, let me see my, this
is going to be shifted by

00:10:35.169 --> 00:10:38.237
10 so you're going to get, this
is going to be at 16 hours,

00:10:38.237 --> 00:10:42.615
so it's going to look something like that.

00:10:42.615 --> 00:10:45.574
And of course it will keep
oscillating like that.

00:10:45.574 --> 00:10:47.755
So essentially we just have
to shift it to the right

00:10:47.755 --> 00:10:50.606
by 10, the argument we
have to replace t with

00:10:50.606 --> 00:10:54.456
t minus 10 to do it and
this was the logic y.
