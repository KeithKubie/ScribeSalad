So how could we not have noticed this gorilla walking through the group? Well,

00:00:03.740 --> 00:00:07.508
we explain this through Selective Attention. The students were so focused on

00:00:07.508 --> 00:00:11.500
paying attention to the ball passing that they weren't aware of the gorilla.

00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:17.334
The technical term for this type of situation is Inattentional Blindness. This

00:00:17.334 --> 00:00:20.974
happens when we're so engaged and paying attention to one thing, that we don't

00:00:20.974 --> 00:00:25.632
notice something. Even if it's as unusual as something as a gorilla in a place

00:00:25.632 --> 00:00:29.203
where it shouldn't be. Now, the take home message here is that, if we

00:00:29.203 --> 00:00:33.479
selectively pay attention to one thing. Our ability to pay attention to other

00:00:33.479 --> 00:00:37.790
things decreases. And we might not even be able to notice unusual stimuli.
