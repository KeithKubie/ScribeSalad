00:00:04.790 --> 00:00:13.400
As a child you might have wondered how a bowl
of punch could be pleased about anything.

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:16.520
Turns out, the saying has nothing to do with
the drink.

00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:20.570
Rather, “punch” refers to the character
in Punch and Judy, a puppet show that has

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:23.980
its roots in Italy’s 16th-century commedia
dell’arte.

00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:26.390
By the 17th century, the show had spread to
England.

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:30.230
The first known record of the English Punch
and Judy appears in the journal of Samuel

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:34.710
Pepys, who saw the show on May 9, 1662 in
Covent Garden, London.

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:35.710
He wrote,

00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:40.050
Thence to see an Italian puppet play that
is within the rayles there, which is very

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:43.830
pretty, the best that ever I saw, and great
resort of gallants.

00:00:43.830 --> 00:00:48.050
The show continued to gain popularity and,
by Victorian times, was being played in all

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:49.670
of the major cities in England.

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:54.090
Today, Punch and Judy is still performed,
though it is much more popular in the UK and

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:55.670
Europe than it is across the pond.

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:58.740
If you’re unfamiliar with the show, you
might be wondering what it’s all about.

00:00:58.740 --> 00:01:03.739
It’s a sort of “variety” puppet show
that acts as a living history—the show is

00:01:03.739 --> 00:01:08.360
always kept topical, which is a major reason
why it has remained so popular over the years.

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:10.380
No two shows are exactly alike.

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:15.280
Instead, they stay true to the issues of the
time, often mocking current political leaders.

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:19.070
For instance, Hitler was once featured in
the show, and more recently, former British

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:21.400
Prime Minister Tony Blair made an appearance.

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:24.450
But the main man of the show is, of course,
Punch.

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:29.310
Usually portrayed as a “hook-nosed, hump-backed
buffoon,” Punch is considered a somewhat

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:31.980
politically incorrect character to put it
lightly.

00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:37.040
He has been depicted beating his wife, murdering
people, and performing other unlawful, mischievous

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:38.040
acts.

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:43.250
Yes—a sadistic, evil, serial killer puppet
gave us the saying “pleased as Punch.”

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:46.040
So, how exactly is he “pleased” again?

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:50.820
Punch is always gleeful about the mayhem he
produces, and appears to be self-satisfied

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:52.780
by committing heinous crimes.

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:57.320
The first time the exact phrase, “pleased
as Punch”, was recorded was sometime in

00:01:57.320 --> 00:01:58.320
1797.

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:02.090
The phrase showed up in The Baviad, and Maeviad,
satires by William Gifford:

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:03.090
Oh!

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:04.770
how my fingers itch to pull thy nose!

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:08.140
As pleased as Punch, I’d hold it in my gripe.

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:11.700
That said, it used to be that “proud as
punch” was another phrase used as commonly

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:12.780
as “pleased.”

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:15.859
You can find an instance of this in Charles
Dickens’ works.

00:02:15.859 --> 00:02:19.310
For instance, in the 1850 publication of David
Copperfield, he wrote:

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:23.709
I am as proud as Punch to think that I once
had the honour of being connected with your

00:02:23.709 --> 00:02:24.709
family.

00:02:24.709 --> 00:02:28.739
Four years later, in Hard Times, Dickens wrote:
“When Sissy got into the school here…

00:02:28.739 --> 00:02:30.870
her father was as pleased as Punch.”

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:34.689
Today, “pleased as punch” is the much
more common phrase, while “proud as punch”

00:02:34.689 --> 00:02:37.150
has faded into the background.

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:47.620
It’s funny to think that we owe it all to
a wife-beating, serial killer puppet—but

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:59.120
the phrase certainly makes more sense when
you know it isn’t attributed to 

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:09.669
the stuff in your punch bowl.
