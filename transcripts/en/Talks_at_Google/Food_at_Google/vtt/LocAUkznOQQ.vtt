00:00:06.280 --> 00:00:07.770
ADAM WILLIAMS: Hello, everybody.

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:08.770
My name's Adam Williams.

00:00:08.770 --> 00:00:12.420
I'm the chef over at Grace
Hopper here in Cambridge.

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:16.270
And I am pleased to introduce
to you a local chef here

00:00:16.270 --> 00:00:20.200
in Boston, a
restaurateur recently

00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:27.280
named "Time's" Most
Influential People 2017,

00:00:27.280 --> 00:00:29.190
the pride of South Boston--

00:00:29.190 --> 00:00:31.430
I can easily say that--

00:00:31.430 --> 00:00:35.260
and author of her new
memoir, "Out of Line--

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:37.180
a Life of Playing with Fire."

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:40.042
Please welcome Chef Barbara
Lynch to Talks at Google.

00:00:40.042 --> 00:00:42.994
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:44.470 --> 00:00:47.340
BARBARA LYNCH: Thanks, Andrew.

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:49.330
Thanks for waiting.

00:00:49.330 --> 00:00:50.959
I'm a shitty driver.

00:00:50.959 --> 00:00:52.375
I think it's time
to get a driver.

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:59.650
Got a speeding ticket this trip.

00:00:59.650 --> 00:01:00.150
OK.

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:05.660
I'm just going to read
a little excerpt, when

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:08.630
I opened Menton, which was
just about 10 years ago.

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:16.460
"As 2009 wore on, I was
getting anxious to open Menton.

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:18.650
It's too soon, people
kept telling me.

00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:23.540
But I noticed that Boston,
like every other city

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:26.090
in the country, is
full of steakhouses

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:28.310
where it costs as
much to eat hunks

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:30.860
of meat from huge
commercial feedlots,

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:33.770
plain old baked potatoes,
and iceberg lettuce

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:37.840
while drinking ordinary booze
and wine at sky-high mark-ups

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:40.400
as it might cost
to dine at Menton.

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:42.410
Of course, some
steakhouses are special.

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:44.450
But often, you pay
top dollar for a meal

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:50.150
you could easily make at
home on the backyard grill.

00:01:50.150 --> 00:01:52.130
Compare that typical
steakhouse meal

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:54.530
with a fine dining experience--

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:56.630
with food that
awakens your palate

00:01:56.630 --> 00:02:00.050
paired with expertly
chosen wines delivered

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:04.220
through flawless service,
which is more worth the price.

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:07.550
During the recession,
the steakhouses

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:09.680
didn't go broke,
because people always

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:13.010
need a place where they
can celebrate with food.

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:16.780
They might be too intimidated
to choose a high-end restaurant,

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:20.660
fearing a stuffy atmosphere,
snooty service, or food

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:23.120
that's too fancy or weird.

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:25.820
I understand that, which
is why we need warm,

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:28.820
unpretentious places where
people can discover and delight

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:29.760
in the new.

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:32.630
I wanted Menton to be
one of those places--

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:36.750
a welcoming setting
with stimulating food.

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:41.120
And I also felt a sense of
responsibility to Boston.

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:44.390
A world class has restaurants
where innovation is always

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:46.110
going on.

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:50.660
They're in a central part
of the cultural landscape.

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:52.610
It was a sin that
we'd lost so many.

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:54.560
And young chefs
need kitchens where

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:57.640
they can observe and start
to experiment with flavors

00:02:57.640 --> 00:03:01.400
while stretching their
techniques beyond bistro food.

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:03.680
When I announced the
launch in December,

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:07.430
the "Boston Globe"
wondered if I was doomed.

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:10.640
In a piece called "The
Gambler in the Kitchen,"

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:13.430
Bella English ticked
off some reasons why.

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:17.210
I was launching an ultra-lavish
restaurant in a weak economy

00:03:17.210 --> 00:03:20.480
that has shuttered other upscale
establishments in the middle

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:21.530
of winter--

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:23.990
normally an off-time
in the industry--

00:03:23.990 --> 00:03:25.820
and in a four-point
channel neighborhood,

00:03:25.820 --> 00:03:30.260
an area that has yet to
truly take off commercially.

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:34.460
The upshot-- this time she's
defying convention as never

00:03:34.460 --> 00:03:36.400
before.

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:38.390
But I went ahead, and
I pulled the trigger.

00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:41.300
Menton opened in spring 2010.

00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:45.050
In April, the "Globe" gave us
a housewarming gift that still

00:03:45.050 --> 00:03:47.330
gives me a shiver of joy--

00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:52.330
a two-page review-- a rave
review in its Sunday magazine.

00:03:52.330 --> 00:03:56.270
Devra First, the
reviewer, praised,

00:03:56.270 --> 00:03:58.340
'The ravioli stuffed
with fava leaf,

00:03:58.340 --> 00:04:01.330
truffles flung about like
rose petals at a wedding,

00:04:01.330 --> 00:04:07.100
fois gras terrene richness
punctuated by sweet wine jelly,

00:04:07.100 --> 00:04:10.340
squiggles of rhubarb
[INAUDIBLE] exuberantly

00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:14.250
on the plate.'"
She's such a writer.

00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:18.320
"'A pea veloute the color
of Kermit pools around candy

00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:23.690
colors, tiny pink radishes,
bright carrots, asparagus tips,

00:04:23.690 --> 00:04:28.640
elephant mushrooms, spiced
with wisps of curry yogurt,

00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:32.660
fat langoustines with blunt,
pink tails wrapped in shredded

00:04:32.660 --> 00:04:35.840
phyllo dough.'" Wow,
she really did like it.

00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:38.420
"'It was downright poetic.

00:04:38.420 --> 00:04:43.040
A pool [INAUDIBLE], a menu
offering maximum pleasure.'

00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:46.880
And that was my goal, exactly
what I wanted to achieve.

00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:50.660
One paragraph that grabbed
me discussed the controversy

00:04:50.660 --> 00:04:52.250
about the opening--

00:04:52.250 --> 00:04:54.800
whether it was arrogant to
open an expensive high-end

00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:57.020
restaurant in tough times.

00:04:57.020 --> 00:05:01.040
Devra First didn't think so
and credited the nerve it took.

00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:04.070
'Chef Barbara Lynch,' she
wrote, 'has canals of steel.

00:05:08.420 --> 00:05:10.640
Men have balls of
steel, but how do

00:05:10.640 --> 00:05:13.700
you say that a woman
is bold for a chef?

00:05:13.700 --> 00:05:16.700
What expression
could be better?'

00:05:16.700 --> 00:05:21.245
I'd like 'she had canal of
steel' to be my epitaph.

00:05:23.890 --> 00:05:25.910
Menton would be listed
in the best restaurant

00:05:25.910 --> 00:05:29.170
round-ups in "Bon Apetit"
and end in "Esquire"

00:05:29.170 --> 00:05:32.420
and be nominated for the best
new restaurant at the 2011

00:05:32.420 --> 00:05:34.160
James Beard Awards.

00:05:34.160 --> 00:05:36.230
Then amazingly,
the restaurant was

00:05:36.230 --> 00:05:38.050
included into
Relais and Chateaux,

00:05:38.050 --> 00:05:41.300
the prestigious
international consortium

00:05:41.300 --> 00:05:45.410
of gourmet restaurants
and boutique hotels.

00:05:45.410 --> 00:05:49.250
Sophisticated travelers pay
a substantial fee to join,

00:05:49.250 --> 00:05:51.740
in order to ensure
that wherever they are,

00:05:51.740 --> 00:05:54.080
they can enjoy
the finest quality

00:05:54.080 --> 00:05:56.420
accommodations and meals.

00:05:56.420 --> 00:05:57.980
Restaurants are
admitted because of

00:05:57.980 --> 00:06:01.890
their innovative cuisine and
outstanding service, confirmed

00:06:01.890 --> 00:06:06.180
by surprise visits of
the 520 chefs scattered

00:06:06.180 --> 00:06:08.040
over five continents.

00:06:08.040 --> 00:06:12.120
Only 35 are in
the United States.

00:06:12.120 --> 00:06:14.910
And I was the only one in
Boston and one of the only six

00:06:14.910 --> 00:06:17.010
female chefs in the world.

00:06:17.010 --> 00:06:20.170
All I could say was, holy
shit, I really fucking did it."

00:06:20.170 --> 00:06:22.470
Sorry.

00:06:22.470 --> 00:06:25.110
"Then I went out, and I got
the heaviest, most beautiful,

00:06:25.110 --> 00:06:27.105
gold plaque I could
find to hang out

00:06:27.105 --> 00:06:30.570
front with the Relais
and Chateaux designation

00:06:30.570 --> 00:06:32.550
in bold lettering.

00:06:32.550 --> 00:06:34.890
I could just hear my mother
saying, Barbara, you better

00:06:34.890 --> 00:06:37.500
make sure no one steals
that, and what in God's name

00:06:37.500 --> 00:06:39.932
does it mean?

00:06:39.932 --> 00:06:41.640
What if I told her it
meant that I opened

00:06:41.640 --> 00:06:43.140
a world-renowned restaurant?

00:06:43.140 --> 00:06:45.960
Jesus Christ, what
a story, she'd say.

00:06:45.960 --> 00:06:48.540
Some kind of chateau.

00:06:48.540 --> 00:06:51.930
Just where the hell
did you come from?"

00:06:51.930 --> 00:06:52.620
Thanks.

00:06:52.620 --> 00:06:53.869
ADAM WILLIAMS: It was awesome.

00:06:53.869 --> 00:06:55.850
[APPLAUSE]

00:06:56.753 --> 00:06:57.794
BARBARA LYNCH: Thank you.

00:06:57.794 --> 00:06:59.260
ADAM WILLIAMS: Truthful.

00:06:59.260 --> 00:07:01.449
So you have seven
restaurants in total, right?

00:07:01.449 --> 00:07:02.740
BARBARA LYNCH: Well, eight now.

00:07:02.740 --> 00:07:03.615
ADAM WILLIAMS: Eight.

00:07:03.615 --> 00:07:08.540
BARBARA LYNCH: Well, I just
partnered with Mario Batali

00:07:08.540 --> 00:07:09.429
at Eataly.

00:07:09.429 --> 00:07:10.470
ADAM WILLIAMS: Beautiful.

00:07:10.470 --> 00:07:12.380
BARBARA LYNCH: It's
my first partnership.

00:07:12.380 --> 00:07:12.920
ADAM WILLIAMS: Great.

00:07:12.920 --> 00:07:15.020
BARBARA LYNCH: It's going
well, surprisingly so.

00:07:17.900 --> 00:07:20.750
ADAM WILLIAMS: How do you
carve out restaurant identities

00:07:20.750 --> 00:07:22.370
on the ones that you have?

00:07:22.370 --> 00:07:24.350
BARBARA LYNCH: How
do I carve out--

00:07:24.350 --> 00:07:25.160
what do you mean?

00:07:25.160 --> 00:07:28.280
ADAM WILLIAMS: So like, your
experiences would create you--

00:07:28.280 --> 00:07:30.410
like, you went to Italy
when you were younger.

00:07:30.410 --> 00:07:31.400
BARBARA LYNCH: Yeah.

00:07:31.400 --> 00:07:32.210
ADAM WILLIAMS: Was
that your reasoning

00:07:32.210 --> 00:07:33.835
for opening Sportello--
that you wanted

00:07:33.835 --> 00:07:34.877
to have this counter bar?

00:07:34.877 --> 00:07:37.335
BARBARA LYNCH: No, that was my
experience at Brigham's when

00:07:37.335 --> 00:07:38.010
I was a kid.

00:07:38.010 --> 00:07:40.370
I worked at Brigham's
on Park Street.

00:07:43.350 --> 00:07:45.837
It's the same formula
as the counter service.

00:07:45.837 --> 00:07:46.670
ADAM WILLIAMS: Yeah.

00:07:46.670 --> 00:07:49.130
BARBARA LYNCH: So I was
a waitress and a cook

00:07:49.130 --> 00:07:53.360
and a packer for the
gallons of ice cream.

00:07:53.360 --> 00:07:55.400
And literally, no one
would show up for work.

00:07:55.400 --> 00:08:00.080
So I would serve, flip
grilled cheese or a burger,

00:08:00.080 --> 00:08:03.980
pour tea, and then make ice
cream sundaes at the same time,

00:08:03.980 --> 00:08:06.440
and cash out, like cashier.

00:08:06.440 --> 00:08:07.600
So yeah.

00:08:07.600 --> 00:08:10.580
And that formula
is really fabulous.

00:08:10.580 --> 00:08:12.290
It really works.

00:08:12.290 --> 00:08:16.040
The Butcher Shop was
my first trip to Italy.

00:08:16.040 --> 00:08:17.780
You could actually go up--

00:08:17.780 --> 00:08:20.690
it was in a little town
called [? Teverina. ?]

00:08:20.690 --> 00:08:24.080
And the girl I worked with at
[? McHale's ?] in Cambridge,

00:08:24.080 --> 00:08:30.050
right around here, her parents
had bought a house in the '70s.

00:08:30.050 --> 00:08:31.220
And she invited me to Italy.

00:08:31.220 --> 00:08:32.678
And that was actually
my first trip

00:08:32.678 --> 00:08:35.539
where you could go up the
hill to this little bodega

00:08:35.539 --> 00:08:38.610
and buy-- well, go to
a wild boar butchering,

00:08:38.610 --> 00:08:43.400
buy your meats, fill up
bottles of wine, white or red,

00:08:43.400 --> 00:08:45.350
have a shot of
[? insanto, ?] get your gas,

00:08:45.350 --> 00:08:50.300
buy your cigarettes, and
then go to the market.

00:08:50.300 --> 00:08:51.720
That was the butcher shop.

00:08:51.720 --> 00:08:53.570
ADAM WILLIAMS: Nice.

00:08:53.570 --> 00:08:56.300
BARBARA LYNCH: B and G
Oysters is my Kelly's Landing

00:08:56.300 --> 00:08:58.180
experience in Southie.

00:08:58.180 --> 00:09:00.200
I would always go
to Kelly's Landing

00:09:00.200 --> 00:09:04.681
for fried clams and calamari.

00:09:04.681 --> 00:09:05.180
No.

00:09:05.180 --> 00:09:08.810
9 was my experience from
the St. Botolph Club.

00:09:08.810 --> 00:09:11.930
I used to be a server
at the St. Botolph Club

00:09:11.930 --> 00:09:13.060
where my mother worked--

00:09:13.060 --> 00:09:18.660
private club, like fine
dining, white tablecloth.

00:09:18.660 --> 00:09:22.569
Drink-- I always wanted a dive
bar, but that's way too cool.

00:09:22.569 --> 00:09:24.860
ADAM WILLIAMS: It's kind of
the opposite of a dive bar.

00:09:24.860 --> 00:09:25.550
BARBARA LYNCH: Yeah.

00:09:25.550 --> 00:09:28.210
My brother used to own the Quiet
Man Pub in Southie across from

00:09:28.210 --> 00:09:30.700
Triple O's.

00:09:30.700 --> 00:09:32.760
Menton is my travels--

00:09:32.760 --> 00:09:34.630
well, that was supposed
to be my swan song.

00:09:34.630 --> 00:09:38.770
So I guess that's not happening.

00:09:38.770 --> 00:09:39.780
What else do I have?

00:09:39.780 --> 00:09:42.377
ADAM WILLIAMS: What
else do I have.

00:09:42.377 --> 00:09:43.210
BARBARA LYNCH: Stir.

00:09:43.210 --> 00:09:44.569
ADAM WILLIAMS: Stir.

00:09:44.569 --> 00:09:47.110
BARBARA LYNCH: That's the same
kitchen as my kitchen at home,

00:09:47.110 --> 00:09:49.800
but just a smaller version.

00:09:49.800 --> 00:09:51.802
With severe ADD, I
just opened that,

00:09:51.802 --> 00:09:53.760
because I knew I was
opening three restaurants.

00:09:53.760 --> 00:09:58.030
So I could cook in that kitchen,
so I knew where everything was.

00:09:58.030 --> 00:09:59.102
And I think I got it all.

00:09:59.102 --> 00:10:00.810
ADAM WILLIAMS: And
they're all in Boston.

00:10:00.810 --> 00:10:01.690
BARBARA LYNCH: Yeah.

00:10:01.690 --> 00:10:03.606
ADAM WILLIAMS: You haven't
gone anywhere else?

00:10:03.606 --> 00:10:05.350
You haven't taken
your show to Vegas?

00:10:05.350 --> 00:10:06.100
BARBARA LYNCH: No.

00:10:06.100 --> 00:10:06.820
ADAM WILLIAMS: Is
there a reason why?

00:10:06.820 --> 00:10:08.440
Is there reason
why you just want

00:10:08.440 --> 00:10:10.065
to stay in Boston, or you--

00:10:10.065 --> 00:10:13.120
BARBARA LYNCH: I'd
gamble too much.

00:10:13.120 --> 00:10:15.880
Well, Boston, first of all,
I felt like it needed--

00:10:15.880 --> 00:10:20.090
I knew what I wanted.

00:10:20.090 --> 00:10:23.140
And Boston didn't
have it at the time.

00:10:23.140 --> 00:10:26.920
And I'm also a community girl.

00:10:26.920 --> 00:10:28.460
I have to have a purpose.

00:10:28.460 --> 00:10:31.120
And I love the city.

00:10:31.120 --> 00:10:32.597
So part of history.

00:10:32.597 --> 00:10:33.430
ADAM WILLIAMS: Yeah.

00:10:33.430 --> 00:10:35.930
Thank you for staying and not
taking your show anywhere else.

00:10:35.930 --> 00:10:37.596
BARBARA LYNCH: Thank
you for being here.

00:10:37.596 --> 00:10:39.640
This is great.

00:10:39.640 --> 00:10:42.350
ADAM WILLIAMS: So is there a
distinctive Barbara Lynch-style

00:10:42.350 --> 00:10:43.527
of food?

00:10:43.527 --> 00:10:45.110
BARBARA LYNCH: Yeah,
I would think so.

00:10:45.110 --> 00:10:50.370
I think it's like fucked
up Italian and French.

00:10:50.370 --> 00:10:52.710
I always say, it's like--

00:10:52.710 --> 00:10:57.720
ah, geez, I think it's
like Italian twisted

00:10:57.720 --> 00:11:02.100
or classical European
food with a flair.

00:11:02.100 --> 00:11:06.600
So Italians would never
put foie gras in a ravioli.

00:11:06.600 --> 00:11:10.782
That's just way too
out-of-the-box for them.

00:11:10.782 --> 00:11:12.990
And the French really don't
go out of the box either.

00:11:12.990 --> 00:11:16.630
So they're very generation,
generation, generation.

00:11:16.630 --> 00:11:20.150
So it's just my take
on their classics.

00:11:20.150 --> 00:11:21.900
ADAM WILLIAMS: Did
your Southie background

00:11:21.900 --> 00:11:27.147
and your rebellionous
kind of ways lead to that?

00:11:27.147 --> 00:11:29.730
BARBARA LYNCH: You could call
it a shortcut kid kind of style.

00:11:29.730 --> 00:11:31.650
ADAM WILLIAMS: Shortcut
kid kind of style.

00:11:35.450 --> 00:11:37.530
So I know that you're
really big in education.

00:11:37.530 --> 00:11:38.662
BARBARA LYNCH: Yeah.

00:11:38.662 --> 00:11:40.620
ADAM WILLIAMS: You didn't
graduate high school.

00:11:40.620 --> 00:11:41.869
You didn't finish high school.

00:11:41.869 --> 00:11:42.690
BARBARA LYNCH: No.

00:11:42.690 --> 00:11:45.150
I was like two points
shy of graduating.

00:11:45.150 --> 00:11:48.210
Plus, it was the height
of forced busing.

00:11:48.210 --> 00:11:55.750
So I was a really terrible
student in high school,

00:11:55.750 --> 00:11:58.510
but a young entrepreneur
in high school.

00:11:58.510 --> 00:12:01.610
I pretty much was a
boogie in high school.

00:12:01.610 --> 00:12:05.760
And I knew how to make
money at a young age.

00:12:05.760 --> 00:12:09.660
So my mom put me in
a parochial school

00:12:09.660 --> 00:12:13.410
that had just started because
of the forced busing era.

00:12:13.410 --> 00:12:14.980
And I wasn't doing so well.

00:12:14.980 --> 00:12:17.400
And so the second year,
she pulled me out.

00:12:17.400 --> 00:12:20.680
I got bused to Madison Park
High, which was really chaotic.

00:12:20.680 --> 00:12:22.630
It was like a war zone.

00:12:22.630 --> 00:12:24.510
So I would skip out
usually at 10:00

00:12:24.510 --> 00:12:29.400
and probably sold
some marijuana maybe.

00:12:29.400 --> 00:12:30.630
I don't know.

00:12:30.630 --> 00:12:33.110
ADAM WILLIAMS: It happens.

00:12:33.110 --> 00:12:35.610
BARBARA LYNCH: And so I had
a lot of time on my hands,

00:12:35.610 --> 00:12:39.510
and I was pretty
creative from 10:00 on.

00:12:39.510 --> 00:12:43.230
And then I had a really
great home ec teacher.

00:12:43.230 --> 00:12:48.000
And she saw talent in me.

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:49.590
So she went to my
guidance counselor

00:12:49.590 --> 00:12:53.410
and said, if this kid doesn't
take cooking for four years,

00:12:53.410 --> 00:12:55.510
then she won't even
stay in school.

00:12:55.510 --> 00:12:59.089
And so I literally stayed
in school for four years.

00:12:59.089 --> 00:13:00.630
But those two points
shy, they wanted

00:13:00.630 --> 00:13:02.296
me to come back and
go to summer school.

00:13:02.296 --> 00:13:04.950
And I'm like, oh,
no, no, no, I am way

00:13:04.950 --> 00:13:07.040
too busy for summer school.

00:13:07.040 --> 00:13:14.680
But later on, when I started
to get accolades as a chef,

00:13:14.680 --> 00:13:19.100
the headmaster Tom Hennessy
came by with [INAUDIBLE],

00:13:19.100 --> 00:13:23.199
who was the guidance counselor,
and gave me my diploma.

00:13:23.199 --> 00:13:24.240
So that was pretty lucky.

00:13:28.620 --> 00:13:30.840
ADAM WILLIAMS: So
you have a daughter.

00:13:30.840 --> 00:13:31.674
BARBARA LYNCH: I do.

00:13:31.674 --> 00:13:33.048
ADAM WILLIAMS: I
have a daughter.

00:13:33.048 --> 00:13:34.210
BARBARA LYNCH: How old?

00:13:34.210 --> 00:13:35.610
ADAM WILLIAMS: She's eight.

00:13:35.610 --> 00:13:38.990
She's crazy, as all
8-year-olds can be.

00:13:38.990 --> 00:13:41.010
BARBARA LYNCH: Mine's
13, and it's-- whew.

00:13:41.010 --> 00:13:42.510
ADAM WILLIAMS: So
I have five years.

00:13:42.510 --> 00:13:44.346
BARBARA LYNCH: Up and
down, up and down.

00:13:44.346 --> 00:13:46.720
ADAM WILLIAMS: What do you
teach your daughter about food

00:13:46.720 --> 00:13:50.100
and I guess in school and life?

00:13:50.100 --> 00:13:51.350
BARBARA LYNCH: She teaches me.

00:13:51.350 --> 00:13:52.016
Are you kidding?

00:13:52.016 --> 00:13:53.930
She's my toughest critic.

00:13:53.930 --> 00:13:56.400
She's been telling me since
four like, Mom, you don't even

00:13:56.400 --> 00:13:58.990
know how to cook popcorn right.

00:13:58.990 --> 00:14:03.270
She puts the Post-It
sticker on the microwave.

00:14:03.270 --> 00:14:06.110
And she points the arrow
to the Popcorn button.

00:14:06.110 --> 00:14:09.690
And I was like, oh,
this is how it is.

00:14:09.690 --> 00:14:13.560
And gently, she'll
take the pasta bowl

00:14:13.560 --> 00:14:16.890
and walks over to the
sink and just smiles at me

00:14:16.890 --> 00:14:18.480
and then empties
out the water, which

00:14:18.480 --> 00:14:21.330
means it's too much water in
the pasta, or it's too much oil.

00:14:21.330 --> 00:14:22.560
ADAM WILLIAMS: She teaches
you how to do pasta?

00:14:22.560 --> 00:14:22.890
BARBARA LYNCH: Huh?

00:14:22.890 --> 00:14:24.848
ADAM WILLIAMS: She teaches
you how to do pasta?

00:14:24.848 --> 00:14:27.660
BARBARA LYNCH: Well,
she'll just gently tell me

00:14:27.660 --> 00:14:31.590
how much she doesn't
like it right now.

00:14:31.590 --> 00:14:34.650
But she can filet a salmon.

00:14:34.650 --> 00:14:36.930
She makes the 45-minute
scrambled eggs.

00:14:41.730 --> 00:14:42.780
We go clamming.

00:14:42.780 --> 00:14:44.940
She can scrub clams, steam them.

00:14:44.940 --> 00:14:46.110
ADAM WILLIAMS: No fear.

00:14:46.110 --> 00:14:46.860
BARBARA LYNCH: No.

00:14:46.860 --> 00:14:47.985
ADAM WILLIAMS: That's good.

00:14:47.985 --> 00:14:50.460
That's a good thing to have.

00:14:50.460 --> 00:14:57.270
What about as far as teaching
her about how the farm-to-table

00:14:57.270 --> 00:15:03.720
movement is a big thing and
how we use our resources,

00:15:03.720 --> 00:15:11.430
as far as locally and as far as
how we treat the earth and how

00:15:11.430 --> 00:15:14.280
you as a chef could teach her--

00:15:14.280 --> 00:15:16.047
do you incorporate
any of that with her?

00:15:16.047 --> 00:15:17.130
BARBARA LYNCH: Yeah, yeah.

00:15:17.130 --> 00:15:18.600
She's taught that in school now.

00:15:18.600 --> 00:15:22.080
And actually, I put
her into a farm school

00:15:22.080 --> 00:15:23.820
during the summer vacation.

00:15:23.820 --> 00:15:25.980
It's called [? White Log ?]
Farm in Winchester.

00:15:25.980 --> 00:15:27.330
She loves it.

00:15:27.330 --> 00:15:30.000
So she knows more about
composting than I do

00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:32.730
and recycling.

00:15:32.730 --> 00:15:34.110
So we're on it.

00:15:34.110 --> 00:15:38.160
Farm-to-table--
yeah, she knows it.

00:15:38.160 --> 00:15:40.030
Well, my best
friend's Ana Sortun,

00:15:40.030 --> 00:15:41.580
so we vacation all summer.

00:15:41.580 --> 00:15:43.625
And Ana's really
earthy, crunchy.

00:15:46.620 --> 00:15:47.817
That's how we live.

00:15:47.817 --> 00:15:48.650
ADAM WILLIAMS: Yeah.

00:15:48.650 --> 00:15:49.440
Nice.

00:15:49.440 --> 00:15:54.600
And Ana Sortun, she wrote
a foreword for your book.

00:15:54.600 --> 00:15:56.370
BARBARA LYNCH:
Oh, she did, yeah.

00:15:56.370 --> 00:15:57.496
She did.

00:15:57.496 --> 00:15:59.120
And she wrote a quote
on the back, too.

00:15:59.120 --> 00:15:59.490
Yeah.

00:15:59.490 --> 00:16:00.323
ADAM WILLIAMS: Yeah.

00:16:00.323 --> 00:16:04.770
So how did your relationship
with her come about?

00:16:04.770 --> 00:16:07.110
You had a lot of great people
write forewords for you

00:16:07.110 --> 00:16:07.740
on your book.

00:16:07.740 --> 00:16:08.630
BARBARA LYNCH: Yeah,
[? Yotam, ?] too.

00:16:08.630 --> 00:16:09.380
Yeah.

00:16:09.380 --> 00:16:11.400
ADAM WILLIAMS: And
I think it's great

00:16:11.400 --> 00:16:15.427
that you had her, being from
Cambridge or around here.

00:16:15.427 --> 00:16:16.260
BARBARA LYNCH: Yeah.

00:16:16.260 --> 00:16:17.957
Ana started cooking at the--

00:16:17.957 --> 00:16:20.040
it's no longer here-- but
at the Trident Bookstore

00:16:20.040 --> 00:16:21.570
Cafe on Newbury Street.

00:16:21.570 --> 00:16:22.440
How old are you?

00:16:22.440 --> 00:16:22.930
ADAM WILLIAMS: I'm 38.

00:16:22.930 --> 00:16:23.540
I don't know it.

00:16:23.540 --> 00:16:24.090
BARBARA LYNCH: Oh, you
wouldn't even know.

00:16:24.090 --> 00:16:25.300
Yeah.

00:16:25.300 --> 00:16:27.240
So at the Trident
Bookstore Cafe,

00:16:27.240 --> 00:16:31.680
I think is now
Stephanie's on Newbury.

00:16:31.680 --> 00:16:34.880
And I didn't know Ana then.

00:16:34.880 --> 00:16:36.290
But I had just started cooking.

00:16:36.290 --> 00:16:38.460
But it was a place I
used to go for lunch,

00:16:38.460 --> 00:16:40.710
because I knew I could
have a bowl of soup

00:16:40.710 --> 00:16:42.270
and read cookbooks
at the same time.

00:16:42.270 --> 00:16:46.920
I was like, fuck, this
is delicious food.

00:16:46.920 --> 00:16:52.020
And then she started working
at Casablanca in Cambridge.

00:16:52.020 --> 00:16:54.720
And I was working
at the Harvest.

00:16:54.720 --> 00:16:56.170
And so then we met.

00:16:56.170 --> 00:16:58.880
And she was all of
like 20, and I was 21.

00:16:58.880 --> 00:17:03.020
So we have been
friends for 30 years.

00:17:03.020 --> 00:17:05.280
And then we used to vacation
together in Westport,

00:17:05.280 --> 00:17:12.180
Mass with [? Esan ?] and Steve
Johnson and [? Cat ?] Sleary

00:17:12.180 --> 00:17:16.160
and a guy called Charlie
Robinson who used to own Eat

00:17:16.160 --> 00:17:17.250
in Cambridge.

00:17:17.250 --> 00:17:21.540
And we vacationed for like 12
years Westport, same house.

00:17:21.540 --> 00:17:22.860
And now we vacation in Truro.

00:17:22.860 --> 00:17:25.380
And her daughter is a
year younger than mine.

00:17:25.380 --> 00:17:28.297
And now they just
Facebook each other.

00:17:28.297 --> 00:17:30.630
It's better than playdate,
because she lives in Sudbury,

00:17:30.630 --> 00:17:34.080
and I live in Winchester,
Gloucester kind of thing.

00:17:34.080 --> 00:17:35.840
Yeah.

00:17:35.840 --> 00:17:36.842
ADAM WILLIAMS: Nice.

00:17:36.842 --> 00:17:38.800
BARBARA LYNCH: And she
teaches me about spices,

00:17:38.800 --> 00:17:40.410
and I teach her
how to make pasta.

00:17:40.410 --> 00:17:41.540
ADAM WILLIAMS: She
teaches you about spices?

00:17:41.540 --> 00:17:41.750
BARBARA LYNCH: Yeah.

00:17:41.750 --> 00:17:42.583
ADAM WILLIAMS: Yeah.

00:17:42.583 --> 00:17:43.180
She is--

00:17:43.180 --> 00:17:45.470
BARBARA LYNCH: She's like
the mayor of Istanbul.

00:17:45.470 --> 00:17:47.650
You should go to Turkey
with her sometime.

00:17:47.650 --> 00:17:48.150
Fun.

00:17:52.535 --> 00:17:54.690
ADAM WILLIAMS: This book
that you've just written--

00:17:54.690 --> 00:17:56.380
BARBARA LYNCH: Yeah.

00:17:56.380 --> 00:17:57.412
ADAM WILLIAMS: Why now?

00:17:57.412 --> 00:17:58.870
It just seems like
you have so much

00:17:58.870 --> 00:18:03.550
going on with all
your restaurants, all

00:18:03.550 --> 00:18:06.470
your individual things
you have going on.

00:18:06.470 --> 00:18:09.440
And then to stop and write
a book, and this book--

00:18:09.440 --> 00:18:12.760
BARBARA LYNCH: Yeah, it
actually took like five years.

00:18:12.760 --> 00:18:17.650
But I had to Google
it, what's a memoir?

00:18:17.650 --> 00:18:20.860
Oh, my god, I did not
want to write this.

00:18:20.860 --> 00:18:24.130
Because first of all, I felt
too young to write this.

00:18:24.130 --> 00:18:26.770
And then what comes after this,
like the Lifetime Achievement

00:18:26.770 --> 00:18:27.270
Award?

00:18:32.387 --> 00:18:33.720
And I never had an agent before.

00:18:33.720 --> 00:18:35.400
But this woman
from New York read

00:18:35.400 --> 00:18:38.430
about a story that
was written about me

00:18:38.430 --> 00:18:40.980
in the business section
of the "New York Times"

00:18:40.980 --> 00:18:43.060
about five years ago.

00:18:43.060 --> 00:18:47.310
And man, did she hound
me to write a book,

00:18:47.310 --> 00:18:49.050
because I have a
story to tell, and it

00:18:49.050 --> 00:18:52.860
would be very powerful
and inspirational

00:18:52.860 --> 00:18:54.100
for other people--

00:18:54.100 --> 00:18:58.530
not just women, but for
underprivileged and just

00:18:58.530 --> 00:19:02.550
for people in general to--

00:19:02.550 --> 00:19:05.240
you can do anything you
want if you want it.

00:19:05.240 --> 00:19:08.310
And so she talked me into it.

00:19:08.310 --> 00:19:09.960
And then here it is.

00:19:09.960 --> 00:19:10.710
And you know what?

00:19:10.710 --> 00:19:12.840
I think the timing is
actually perfect right now

00:19:12.840 --> 00:19:14.060
with the way the world is.

00:19:14.060 --> 00:19:17.010
And so it is good timing.

00:19:17.010 --> 00:19:18.219
And it's doing great.

00:19:18.219 --> 00:19:19.260
ADAM WILLIAMS: Excellent.

00:19:19.260 --> 00:19:19.790
BARBARA LYNCH: Yeah.

00:19:19.790 --> 00:19:21.998
ADAM WILLIAMS: And what do
you hope your readers will

00:19:21.998 --> 00:19:23.152
take away from it?

00:19:23.152 --> 00:19:24.360
What do you want them to see?

00:19:28.257 --> 00:19:30.090
BARBARA LYNCH: I want
them to know that they

00:19:30.090 --> 00:19:31.500
can do anything they want.

00:19:31.500 --> 00:19:34.330
I want them to be inspired--

00:19:34.330 --> 00:19:42.240
that if I can do this with zero
education and pretty, really

00:19:42.240 --> 00:19:45.330
humble upbringing,
then they can do it.

00:19:45.330 --> 00:19:49.380
Not just open a restaurant, but
they can do anything they want.

00:19:49.380 --> 00:19:52.200
ADAM WILLIAMS: Have you
gotten over your insecurities?

00:19:52.200 --> 00:19:54.090
BARBARA LYNCH: No,
but most of them.

00:19:54.090 --> 00:19:56.450
Yeah.

00:19:56.450 --> 00:19:58.900
Now I'm kind of
happy who I am now.

00:19:58.900 --> 00:20:03.532
I'm pretty confident--
more confident, tougher.

00:20:03.532 --> 00:20:04.990
ADAM WILLIAMS:
Tougher than before?

00:20:04.990 --> 00:20:07.000
BARBARA LYNCH: And
gentler at the same time.

00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:08.666
ADAM WILLIAMS: I can
see how that works.

00:20:11.220 --> 00:20:12.415
Tough when you have to be.

00:20:12.415 --> 00:20:17.120
BARBARA LYNCH: I'm
smarter, put it that way.

00:20:17.120 --> 00:20:19.870
When I say I'm more
confident, I guess I'm more--

00:20:19.870 --> 00:20:23.860
now I love business part, too.

00:20:23.860 --> 00:20:26.470
I'm confident in cooking.

00:20:26.470 --> 00:20:27.220
I got it.

00:20:27.220 --> 00:20:28.720
ADAM WILLIAMS: Yeah,
I can't see how

00:20:28.720 --> 00:20:31.155
you'd have any insecurities,
from what well I've

00:20:31.155 --> 00:20:32.365
seen over your years.

00:20:32.365 --> 00:20:34.490
BARBARA LYNCH: Yeah, I come
across as really tough.

00:20:34.490 --> 00:20:37.824
But man, I'm like a teddy bear.

00:20:37.824 --> 00:20:38.740
ADAM WILLIAMS: Really?

00:20:38.740 --> 00:20:39.035
BARBARA LYNCH: Yeah.

00:20:39.035 --> 00:20:39.490
Soft.

00:20:39.490 --> 00:20:40.390
ADAM WILLIAMS: Oh, I was scared.

00:20:40.390 --> 00:20:41.598
BARBARA LYNCH: I got a heart.

00:20:42.629 --> 00:20:44.170
ADAM WILLIAMS: In
your book, you talk

00:20:44.170 --> 00:20:48.340
about cooking as the
drama of creation,

00:20:48.340 --> 00:20:51.460
even a miracle in the making.

00:20:51.460 --> 00:20:53.990
Can you describe a recent
miracle in your kitchen--

00:20:53.990 --> 00:20:56.770
in one of your kitchens or
in the kitchen-- whatever

00:20:56.770 --> 00:20:58.635
you call your kitchen.

00:20:58.635 --> 00:21:00.010
BARBARA LYNCH: I
say a miracle is

00:21:00.010 --> 00:21:03.100
like when you kind
of invent a dish,

00:21:03.100 --> 00:21:05.040
because food's
already been invented.

00:21:05.040 --> 00:21:10.000
So I'm not really
into molecular.

00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:13.900
But a dish like a
pruned-stuff gnocchi

00:21:13.900 --> 00:21:17.952
has never been made
before, that I know of.

00:21:17.952 --> 00:21:19.660
ADAM WILLIAMS: I've
never seen it before.

00:21:19.660 --> 00:21:20.535
BARBARA LYNCH: Right.

00:21:20.535 --> 00:21:22.899
You can't find it in a
recipe book, except for mine.

00:21:22.899 --> 00:21:24.440
ADAM WILLIAMS: I've
tried to copy it.

00:21:24.440 --> 00:21:25.210
BARBARA LYNCH: You did?

00:21:25.210 --> 00:21:26.030
ADAM WILLIAMS: I did.

00:21:26.030 --> 00:21:26.210
BARBARA LYNCH: How'd it go?

00:21:26.210 --> 00:21:26.830
ADAM WILLIAMS: Sorry.

00:21:26.830 --> 00:21:27.955
BARBARA LYNCH: That's fine.

00:21:27.955 --> 00:21:30.780
I'm flattered.

00:21:30.780 --> 00:21:33.530
ADAM WILLIAMS: Yeah, I used
prunes in a dish once--

00:21:33.530 --> 00:21:35.642
pasta dish.

00:21:35.642 --> 00:21:36.940
BARBARA LYNCH: How'd it go?

00:21:36.940 --> 00:21:37.740
ADAM WILLIAMS: I
thought it was OK.

00:21:37.740 --> 00:21:38.781
It definitely was not No.

00:21:38.781 --> 00:21:40.342
9 Park.

00:21:40.342 --> 00:21:41.550
BARBARA LYNCH: But that's OK.

00:21:41.550 --> 00:21:42.390
ADAM WILLIAMS: But
I tried, you know?

00:21:42.390 --> 00:21:43.723
BARBARA LYNCH: That's your dish.

00:21:43.723 --> 00:21:45.070
ADAM WILLIAMS: Yeah.

00:21:45.070 --> 00:21:47.590
But you definitely
inspired me to go out

00:21:47.590 --> 00:21:49.271
and try different things.

00:21:49.271 --> 00:21:50.770
BARBARA LYNCH: Well,
that's awesome.

00:21:50.770 --> 00:21:53.170
That's good.

00:21:53.170 --> 00:21:55.570
And then the butter
soup at Menton

00:21:55.570 --> 00:22:03.880
is just butter and shellfish
and milk and honey.

00:22:03.880 --> 00:22:07.980
But I don't think anybody made
butter soup before either.

00:22:07.980 --> 00:22:09.070
But it's good butter.

00:22:09.070 --> 00:22:10.690
It's like 87% butter.

00:22:10.690 --> 00:22:11.860
ADAM WILLIAMS: Wow.

00:22:11.860 --> 00:22:14.620
BARBARA LYNCH: Fat-- butter fat.

00:22:14.620 --> 00:22:16.260
But we have cows in Vermont.

00:22:16.260 --> 00:22:18.920
And she's absolutely brilliant.

00:22:18.920 --> 00:22:24.126
And it's the way she feeds
the cows-- so wild flowers

00:22:24.126 --> 00:22:24.625
and hops.

00:22:27.542 --> 00:22:29.250
ADAM WILLIAMS: And
you have your own cow?

00:22:29.250 --> 00:22:31.300
BARBARA LYNCH: Well,
we lease the cows.

00:22:31.300 --> 00:22:36.150
And it's the most
expensive butter ever.

00:22:36.150 --> 00:22:39.820
She makes butter for
me and Thomas Keller.

00:22:39.820 --> 00:22:43.420
I think we're the crazy
chefs that will do it.

00:22:43.420 --> 00:22:45.370
But it's also
supporting a farmer.

00:22:45.370 --> 00:22:46.561
She's a one-woman show.

00:22:46.561 --> 00:22:48.310
ADAM WILLIAMS: Yeah,
that's a great thing.

00:22:48.310 --> 00:22:50.000
BARBARA LYNCH: She's amazing.

00:22:50.000 --> 00:22:52.320
She's up in Orwell, Vermont--

00:22:52.320 --> 00:22:55.144
Animal Farm, Diane St. Clair.

00:22:55.144 --> 00:22:56.560
ADAM WILLIAMS: I
will look her up.

00:22:56.560 --> 00:22:59.244
BARBARA LYNCH: She makes
amazing buttermilk, too.

00:22:59.244 --> 00:23:01.410
ADAM WILLIAMS: Probably
really expensive buttermilk.

00:23:01.410 --> 00:23:02.410
BARBARA LYNCH: Probably.

00:23:04.330 --> 00:23:07.930
But she's always growing
and experimenting.

00:23:07.930 --> 00:23:10.790
And finally, she's
got some help.

00:23:10.790 --> 00:23:13.300
She trusts somebody to
help her make cheese.

00:23:13.300 --> 00:23:16.030
So she's starting to make
cheese and more things.

00:23:16.030 --> 00:23:18.832
She loves her cows.

00:23:18.832 --> 00:23:20.656
And it shows in the butter.

00:23:20.656 --> 00:23:23.072
ADAM WILLIAMS: Yeah, and if
you're going to just turn that

00:23:23.072 --> 00:23:24.340
into a butter soup--

00:23:24.340 --> 00:23:28.850
BARBARA LYNCH: Looks interesting
on the [INAUDIBLE], cows.

00:23:28.850 --> 00:23:31.970
ADAM WILLIAMS: Chefs on TV
and the public fascination

00:23:31.970 --> 00:23:35.000
with this--

00:23:35.000 --> 00:23:36.917
is it something you see
yourself trying to do?

00:23:36.917 --> 00:23:38.250
BARBARA LYNCH: What's the show--

00:23:38.250 --> 00:23:39.470
"Chef's Table" or something?

00:23:39.470 --> 00:23:44.610
I think that's like
the history of a chef.

00:23:44.610 --> 00:23:46.710
I don't really watch it.

00:23:46.710 --> 00:23:49.730
But the good and the
bad-- the good thing

00:23:49.730 --> 00:23:53.420
is that there's an
audience out there.

00:23:53.420 --> 00:23:57.050
The reality shows are crazy.

00:23:57.050 --> 00:24:01.820
But there is an audience
out there that watches it.

00:24:01.820 --> 00:24:08.270
I just wish that there were more
shows that are teaching people

00:24:08.270 --> 00:24:13.190
how to cook instead of judging
them how to cook because

00:24:13.190 --> 00:24:14.430
of the audience.

00:24:14.430 --> 00:24:16.260
And you would learn a lot more.

00:24:16.260 --> 00:24:16.760
Right?

00:24:16.760 --> 00:24:18.219
ADAM WILLIAMS: Definitely.

00:24:18.219 --> 00:24:20.510
BARBARA LYNCH: What I find
fascinating is the age group

00:24:20.510 --> 00:24:23.160
that is actually cooking,
which is the 13-,

00:24:23.160 --> 00:24:27.740
14-year-olds that want to cook
and want to learn how to cook.

00:24:27.740 --> 00:24:29.660
My daughter and her
group of friends

00:24:29.660 --> 00:24:31.800
are just friggin' crazy.

00:24:31.800 --> 00:24:33.470
They're doing their
own "Top Chefs"

00:24:33.470 --> 00:24:36.410
in the kitchen, which
I don't stop it,

00:24:36.410 --> 00:24:38.750
because although
they're making a mess,

00:24:38.750 --> 00:24:43.370
it's like, wow, they're
just experimenting.

00:24:43.370 --> 00:24:44.630
And they're making cakes.

00:24:44.630 --> 00:24:47.180
And they're just
crazy in the kitchen.

00:24:47.180 --> 00:24:52.550
That is a good thing, which if
there were better shows that

00:24:52.550 --> 00:24:55.760
were really kind of fun--

00:24:55.760 --> 00:24:59.600
like a Julia Child cooking
show again would be amazing.

00:24:59.600 --> 00:25:01.930
From beginning to
end would be great.

00:25:01.930 --> 00:25:02.960
ADAM WILLIAMS: Instead
of just showing off--

00:25:02.960 --> 00:25:04.501
BARBARA LYNCH: Yeah,
potato five ways

00:25:04.501 --> 00:25:08.750
or the basics and knife skills
would be amazing, from consomme

00:25:08.750 --> 00:25:10.930
to stocks, et cetera.

00:25:10.930 --> 00:25:12.650
It would be a great thing.

00:25:12.650 --> 00:25:16.320
But then we wouldn't be held
captive by packaged foods.

00:25:16.320 --> 00:25:22.550
And perhaps we wouldn't be
obese if we taught more cooking

00:25:22.550 --> 00:25:23.500
healthy.

00:25:23.500 --> 00:25:26.304
ADAM WILLIAMS: Well,
there's your next job.

00:25:26.304 --> 00:25:27.470
BARBARA LYNCH: I don't know.

00:25:27.470 --> 00:25:28.720
I'm not a really good teacher.

00:25:28.720 --> 00:25:30.420
But who knows?

00:25:30.420 --> 00:25:31.850
ADAM WILLIAMS: Who knows?

00:25:31.850 --> 00:25:32.280
BARBARA LYNCH: Who knows?

00:25:32.280 --> 00:25:33.050
ADAM WILLIAMS: I see it.

00:25:33.050 --> 00:25:33.420
BARBARA LYNCH: You do?

00:25:33.420 --> 00:25:33.840
ADAM WILLIAMS: I do.

00:25:33.840 --> 00:25:34.790
BARBARA LYNCH: Maybe me and you?

00:25:34.790 --> 00:25:35.690
ADAM WILLIAMS: That'd be nice.

00:25:35.690 --> 00:25:36.731
BARBARA LYNCH: All right.

00:25:36.731 --> 00:25:37.454
Let's do it.

00:25:37.454 --> 00:25:40.497
Live at Google--

00:25:40.497 --> 00:25:42.080
ADAM WILLIAMS: We're
going open up Q&amp;A

00:25:42.080 --> 00:25:44.269
if anybody has a question.

00:25:44.269 --> 00:25:45.185
AUDIENCE: Hi, Barbara.

00:25:45.185 --> 00:25:45.800
BARBARA LYNCH: Hi.

00:25:45.800 --> 00:25:46.400
AUDIENCE: Thanks for coming.

00:25:46.400 --> 00:25:47.608
BARBARA LYNCH: Oh, thank you.

00:25:47.608 --> 00:25:49.940
Thanks for waiting.

00:25:49.940 --> 00:25:51.940
AUDIENCE: Earlier
you said you're

00:25:51.940 --> 00:25:53.300
tougher, kinder, smarter.

00:25:53.300 --> 00:25:55.152
BARBARA LYNCH: Tougher,
kinder, smarter.

00:25:55.152 --> 00:25:56.360
AUDIENCE: Right, all at once.

00:25:56.360 --> 00:26:01.550
Do you have any people
who have inspired you,

00:26:01.550 --> 00:26:04.100
in terms of your
management style,

00:26:04.100 --> 00:26:07.197
either inside or outside of
your industry that maybe you've

00:26:07.197 --> 00:26:08.780
read about or that
you've met with who

00:26:08.780 --> 00:26:11.729
have helped you become smarter?

00:26:11.729 --> 00:26:13.520
BARBARA LYNCH: Yeah,
but I forget his name.

00:26:13.520 --> 00:26:16.066
He used to run the LA Lakers.

00:26:16.066 --> 00:26:16.940
AUDIENCE: Jerry Buss?

00:26:16.940 --> 00:26:18.590
ADAM WILLIAMS: Jerry Buss.

00:26:18.590 --> 00:26:20.631
BARBARA LYNCH: Was there
another one before that?

00:26:20.631 --> 00:26:22.100
AUDIENCE: Jerry
West, Jerry Buss.

00:26:22.100 --> 00:26:23.340
BARBARA LYNCH: I think so.

00:26:23.340 --> 00:26:25.650
AUDIENCE: OK, tell us why.

00:26:25.650 --> 00:26:27.400
BARBARA LYNCH: Well,
he was a team player.

00:26:27.400 --> 00:26:29.900
He wasn't just the coach.

00:26:29.900 --> 00:26:30.590
He really insp--

00:26:30.590 --> 00:26:31.589
AUDIENCE: Oh, Pat Riley.

00:26:31.589 --> 00:26:33.187
BARBARA LYNCH: Pat Riley, yeah.

00:26:33.187 --> 00:26:35.270
So when I first started
cooking, I don't know why,

00:26:35.270 --> 00:26:35.987
but I loved him.

00:26:35.987 --> 00:26:37.445
And I loved the
way he was a coach.

00:26:40.100 --> 00:26:41.450
He was just part of the team.

00:26:41.450 --> 00:26:44.300
And that really inspired
me from my first--

00:26:44.300 --> 00:26:47.930
I want to say my first
five restaurants.

00:26:47.930 --> 00:26:57.410
And then it was more about
kind of feeding the masses.

00:26:57.410 --> 00:27:03.560
So you can't really be
snobbish about what you want

00:27:03.560 --> 00:27:05.630
and what you want to cook.

00:27:05.630 --> 00:27:08.300
You have to feed what
the public wants.

00:27:08.300 --> 00:27:10.760
Throw a little bit
of creativity in it,

00:27:10.760 --> 00:27:14.210
so you can get the world in.

00:27:14.210 --> 00:27:16.992
And then you'll shine.

00:27:16.992 --> 00:27:18.950
Honestly, I could eat a
peanut butter and jelly

00:27:18.950 --> 00:27:19.950
sandwich every day.

00:27:19.950 --> 00:27:24.290
But I love the craft of cooking.

00:27:24.290 --> 00:27:26.180
I'm not a foodie-foodie.

00:27:26.180 --> 00:27:29.645
But I love the
process of cooking.

00:27:32.920 --> 00:27:39.040
So there's another book
that I read about creativity

00:27:39.040 --> 00:27:42.250
and how to survive it and
how to be successful at it.

00:27:42.250 --> 00:27:44.800
I forget the name
of the book, though.

00:27:44.800 --> 00:27:50.960
Management style-- probably
Danny Meyer, too, "Table Talk."

00:27:50.960 --> 00:27:54.290
AUDIENCE: You mentioned teaching
people to cook and things

00:27:54.290 --> 00:27:55.610
like knife skills.

00:27:55.610 --> 00:27:57.050
What other stuff
like knife skills

00:27:57.050 --> 00:28:03.230
should people learn who want
to actually learn how to cook?

00:28:03.230 --> 00:28:04.430
BARBARA LYNCH: At home, too?

00:28:04.430 --> 00:28:09.590
Yeah, sharpening stones-- do
you have a sharpening stone

00:28:09.590 --> 00:28:11.060
at home anyone?

00:28:11.060 --> 00:28:13.470
The whetstones?

00:28:13.470 --> 00:28:16.080
Yeah, I would say,
just take time.

00:28:16.080 --> 00:28:17.640
It's really
therapeutic, actually,

00:28:17.640 --> 00:28:19.810
if you use a whetstone.

00:28:19.810 --> 00:28:22.290
And it usually takes about
a half an hour a knife.

00:28:24.830 --> 00:28:28.340
But you can YouTube
it and Google it,

00:28:28.340 --> 00:28:30.680
and they'll show
you how to do it,

00:28:30.680 --> 00:28:32.990
because I think if your
knife is really sharp,

00:28:32.990 --> 00:28:35.510
it takes about a second
to chop a carrot.

00:28:35.510 --> 00:28:39.710
But if you don't, it
really is like torture.

00:28:39.710 --> 00:28:43.730
I think knife skills and really
prepping ahead mise en place

00:28:43.730 --> 00:28:45.540
is key.

00:28:45.540 --> 00:28:48.720
And then cooking is
so easy after that.

00:28:48.720 --> 00:28:50.090
And I'm a huge induction fan.

00:28:50.090 --> 00:28:52.550
I don't know if
anybody has induction.

00:28:52.550 --> 00:28:54.200
Yeah, love it.

00:28:54.200 --> 00:28:59.630
Fast, clean, really
clean, holds temperatures,

00:28:59.630 --> 00:29:02.470
and it's just awesome.

00:29:02.470 --> 00:29:05.410
But teaching to cook is like--

00:29:05.410 --> 00:29:07.720
I guess once you
get the basics down,

00:29:07.720 --> 00:29:10.970
then you can just
fly through it.

00:29:10.970 --> 00:29:12.460
And also, use your fridge.

00:29:12.460 --> 00:29:15.640
Clean out your fridge
and just use it up.

00:29:15.640 --> 00:29:18.640
And one pot wonders
are always fun, too.

00:29:18.640 --> 00:29:19.870
Just be creative.

00:29:23.410 --> 00:29:25.180
AUDIENCE: Hey, I
was wondering, what

00:29:25.180 --> 00:29:29.560
do you think has been more
a part of you-- being a chef

00:29:29.560 --> 00:29:31.210
or being an entrepreneur?

00:29:31.210 --> 00:29:32.750
BARBARA LYNCH: Chef first.

00:29:32.750 --> 00:29:34.937
Entrepreneur was crazy.

00:29:34.937 --> 00:29:36.520
I think I remember
when somebody said,

00:29:36.520 --> 00:29:37.805
she's a serial entrepreneur.

00:29:37.805 --> 00:29:38.680
I had to Google that.

00:29:38.680 --> 00:29:41.740
I was like, wow, what is that?

00:29:41.740 --> 00:29:43.780
But now I like being
an entrepreneur,

00:29:43.780 --> 00:29:47.940
because it just creates
more jobs within.

00:29:47.940 --> 00:29:50.500
And I love to see the staff.

00:29:50.500 --> 00:29:54.010
It's also fun to set
them up for success.

00:29:54.010 --> 00:29:55.510
It makes me feel
like a grandmother.

00:29:55.510 --> 00:29:57.760
But it's also really
fun to see them succeed.

00:30:00.310 --> 00:30:04.690
It's also fun to see some come
back when they leave too soon.

00:30:04.690 --> 00:30:06.730
And then they come back.

00:30:06.730 --> 00:30:10.330
And we're going to go through
another really big growth

00:30:10.330 --> 00:30:11.935
spurt, which is
going to be exciting.

00:30:14.680 --> 00:30:17.920
And this time, we might
go global, so even better.

00:30:20.850 --> 00:30:24.910
So yeah, it's
entrepreneurship now.

00:30:24.910 --> 00:30:26.500
Now I'm ready for it.

00:30:26.500 --> 00:30:28.200
Before, I wasn't.

00:30:28.200 --> 00:30:30.910
And before, I wasn't ready
to be a chef-chef, either.

00:30:30.910 --> 00:30:33.070
So you learn.

00:30:33.070 --> 00:30:35.290
I've been cooking
for 32 plus years.

00:30:35.290 --> 00:30:38.760
So you go through
that experiment stage

00:30:38.760 --> 00:30:40.100
and too much shit on a plate.

00:30:40.100 --> 00:30:42.880
Now it's just, perfection.

00:30:42.880 --> 00:30:48.610
And I'll never be happy
with what I'm cooking.

00:30:48.610 --> 00:30:52.360
I'll always learn--
always learning.

00:30:52.360 --> 00:30:58.900
But I know I don't want
molecular in my life.

00:30:58.900 --> 00:31:01.970
I just don't.

00:31:01.970 --> 00:31:02.695
I love textures.

00:31:06.538 --> 00:31:09.514
AUDIENCE: Have you considered
going outside your wheelhouse

00:31:09.514 --> 00:31:12.122
of French and Italian?

00:31:12.122 --> 00:31:13.330
BARBARA LYNCH: At home, I do.

00:31:13.330 --> 00:31:14.290
Yeah.

00:31:14.290 --> 00:31:20.990
Burmese, I love Thai,
I love Middle Eastern.

00:31:20.990 --> 00:31:22.610
Yeah.

00:31:22.610 --> 00:31:24.640
But I don't want a
restaurant like that,

00:31:24.640 --> 00:31:26.074
because that's just not--

00:31:26.074 --> 00:31:28.240
because I'll always fall
back on Italian and French.

00:31:31.460 --> 00:31:32.940
I love cooking Indian food.

00:31:32.940 --> 00:31:35.000
Oh, my god.

00:31:35.000 --> 00:31:37.070
It's all about the
pantry, really.

00:31:37.070 --> 00:31:41.900
If you have all the
ingredients, that's so fun.

00:31:41.900 --> 00:31:44.230
But I know I'll always go back.

00:31:44.230 --> 00:31:45.790
AUDIENCE: Can you
talk a little bit

00:31:45.790 --> 00:31:52.300
about the biggest differences in
what you learned or experienced

00:31:52.300 --> 00:31:54.700
in business between
your first restaurant

00:31:54.700 --> 00:31:56.020
and your last restaurant?

00:31:56.020 --> 00:32:01.480
How hard was it to
launch as a non-brand,

00:32:01.480 --> 00:32:04.440
compared to launching
now as a brand?

00:32:04.440 --> 00:32:05.920
BARBARA LYNCH: Hmm.

00:32:05.920 --> 00:32:08.000
It got a little easier.

00:32:08.000 --> 00:32:11.410
It just got more expensive.

00:32:11.410 --> 00:32:16.120
I'm kind of talk about the
development-wise or real

00:32:16.120 --> 00:32:19.000
estate.

00:32:19.000 --> 00:32:24.850
Brand-wise, I had to
realize that I'm the brand.

00:32:24.850 --> 00:32:26.440
And I think that
was really hard.

00:32:26.440 --> 00:32:30.050
I think it's hard to realize
that Barbara Lynch was

00:32:30.050 --> 00:32:31.450
the brand.

00:32:31.450 --> 00:32:38.950
And it was also hard to convince
my operations manager that it's

00:32:38.950 --> 00:32:47.200
ridiculous to try to brand a
single restaurant as, say, Stir

00:32:47.200 --> 00:32:51.010
and then try to brand the
chef who's running Stir,

00:32:51.010 --> 00:32:55.440
because after being
open for 12 years,

00:32:55.440 --> 00:32:59.530
Barbara Lynch's Stir would go
a lot farther than just Stir.

00:32:59.530 --> 00:33:05.290
So we are actually re-branding
the whole brand now.

00:33:05.290 --> 00:33:06.850
Instead of Barbara
Lynch [? Group, ?]

00:33:06.850 --> 00:33:10.510
it will be just Barbara Lynch's
Stir, Barbara Lynch's 9 Park,

00:33:10.510 --> 00:33:14.320
Barbara Lynch's Menton,
because believe it or not,

00:33:14.320 --> 00:33:16.360
a lot of people can
eat at the restaurants

00:33:16.360 --> 00:33:20.800
and really have no idea that
I own all of the restaurants.

00:33:20.800 --> 00:33:24.910
So it's kind of important to
really look at it every five

00:33:24.910 --> 00:33:27.310
years and make sure that--

00:33:27.310 --> 00:33:31.210
from afar-- step back and
kind of look at the brand

00:33:31.210 --> 00:33:35.050
again and make sure it's right.

00:33:35.050 --> 00:33:38.110
I had a catering company
called Niche Catour.

00:33:38.110 --> 00:33:40.530
That was awful.

00:33:40.530 --> 00:33:43.120
The phone call, Nicki Catouri--

00:33:43.120 --> 00:33:45.520
oh, my god, what did I do?

00:33:45.520 --> 00:33:49.505
And then 9 at Home was
actually much better,

00:33:49.505 --> 00:33:50.380
because they knew No.

00:33:50.380 --> 00:33:50.960
9.

00:33:50.960 --> 00:33:51.460
So No.

00:33:51.460 --> 00:33:58.165
9 at Home was a hit, although I
kind of put that one to sleep,

00:33:58.165 --> 00:34:02.771
because it was tough to run
a catering company that was--

00:34:02.771 --> 00:34:05.270
most of the catering companies
are already grandfathered in.

00:34:05.270 --> 00:34:08.710
And hard to run a
catering company

00:34:08.710 --> 00:34:11.350
if you don't have
a huge commissary

00:34:11.350 --> 00:34:14.800
and catering China,
glassware, silver

00:34:14.800 --> 00:34:17.500
in a huge warehouse with
all the rental equipment,

00:34:17.500 --> 00:34:19.239
because it's too costly.

00:34:19.239 --> 00:34:23.510
Another little "you learn from
your mistakes" kind of thing.

00:34:23.510 --> 00:34:25.239
AUDIENCE: So since
you've got a roomful

00:34:25.239 --> 00:34:26.610
of geeks here at Google--

00:34:26.610 --> 00:34:27.310
BARBARA LYNCH: I love geeks.

00:34:27.310 --> 00:34:27.820
I want to hang out.

00:34:27.820 --> 00:34:30.111
AUDIENCE: So I want to push
you on this molecular thing

00:34:30.111 --> 00:34:31.699
a little bit, because
I like to cook.

00:34:31.699 --> 00:34:34.449
But I also, not big on
foams or making spheres

00:34:34.449 --> 00:34:35.260
or stuff like that.

00:34:35.260 --> 00:34:37.989
But if I'm making
jam, I'll still

00:34:37.989 --> 00:34:40.090
pick up [? Terrence ?]
McGee "On Food and Cooking"

00:34:40.090 --> 00:34:44.230
and look at how the proteins
bind and the little acid helps.

00:34:44.230 --> 00:34:46.420
And I like my sous-vide.

00:34:46.420 --> 00:34:48.790
So aside from the mol--

00:34:48.790 --> 00:34:50.980
BARBARA LYNCH: I love my
Cryovac machine, though.

00:34:50.980 --> 00:34:52.320
AUDIENCE: So the question
is, do you still apprec--

00:34:52.320 --> 00:34:54.520
there has been this
huge trend in science

00:34:54.520 --> 00:34:56.929
and cooking and understanding
the science of food

00:34:56.929 --> 00:34:58.570
and what's happening,
which I think

00:34:58.570 --> 00:35:01.240
has made cooking a lot better.

00:35:01.240 --> 00:35:03.605
Do you sort of learn from
that and take from that?

00:35:03.605 --> 00:35:05.230
Or do you still go
by gut and instincts

00:35:05.230 --> 00:35:08.654
and what's worked and history?

00:35:08.654 --> 00:35:10.820
BARBARA LYNCH: Well, I'm
not saying the science of--

00:35:10.820 --> 00:35:14.740
I love the process
of putting vinegar

00:35:14.740 --> 00:35:17.770
in water for quail
eggs, blah, blah, blah,

00:35:17.770 --> 00:35:21.370
or why you put vinegar
to poach an egg.

00:35:21.370 --> 00:35:24.850
I love that process
of the science, yeah.

00:35:24.850 --> 00:35:26.185
I don't like adding--

00:35:28.980 --> 00:35:31.072
what the hell.

00:35:31.072 --> 00:35:32.530
AUDIENCE: You don't
glue your meat?

00:35:32.530 --> 00:35:34.779
ADAM WILLIAMS: [INAUDIBLE]
maltodextrin to everything?

00:35:34.779 --> 00:35:36.480
BARBARA LYNCH: No, I don't.

00:35:36.480 --> 00:35:37.930
You know what I mean?

00:35:37.930 --> 00:35:41.110
I don't like the shit that
goes on my tongue or the way

00:35:41.110 --> 00:35:44.530
it feels on my tongue.

00:35:44.530 --> 00:35:45.930
I don't like that.

00:35:45.930 --> 00:35:49.930
And I'm kind of over the
[? "noma" ?] plating of every

00:35:49.930 --> 00:35:51.140
dish.

00:35:51.140 --> 00:35:55.120
Everyone looks the same
in that plating world.

00:35:55.120 --> 00:35:57.189
That's just me.

00:35:57.189 --> 00:35:58.980
We have a round plate,
and everybody plates

00:35:58.980 --> 00:36:00.250
a little bit on the edge.

00:36:00.250 --> 00:36:03.280
It just fucking gets me mad.

00:36:03.280 --> 00:36:05.710
I'm sorry.

00:36:05.710 --> 00:36:09.460
Can we go back to the masters,
Jean-Louis Palladin even?

00:36:09.460 --> 00:36:12.780
Go back and plate
real food maybe.

00:36:12.780 --> 00:36:14.650
Try.

00:36:14.650 --> 00:36:16.966
That's just me.

00:36:16.966 --> 00:36:19.150
And I'm not knocking
it, because it

00:36:19.150 --> 00:36:22.810
would take me another 50 years
to learn how to cook that way.

00:36:22.810 --> 00:36:24.700
And I love Harry McGee.

00:36:24.700 --> 00:36:27.310
I love him and Wylie Dufresne.

00:36:27.310 --> 00:36:28.900
And I'm not knocking it at all.

00:36:31.960 --> 00:36:34.180
It takes about five
years to kind of come up

00:36:34.180 --> 00:36:37.260
with a dish that
actually works that way.

00:36:37.260 --> 00:36:41.100
And it's already been
invented by [? NASA ?] anyway.

00:36:41.100 --> 00:36:44.290
It's like, you're taking
chemicals and everything

00:36:44.290 --> 00:36:47.380
that they've invented and
trying to put a dish together

00:36:47.380 --> 00:36:49.780
that will actually work.

00:36:49.780 --> 00:36:52.510
That's torture, man.

00:36:52.510 --> 00:36:57.130
That's like a mad scientist
trying to invent something.

00:36:57.130 --> 00:36:57.940
I don't know.

00:36:57.940 --> 00:37:01.090
Let's spend some of
that time trying to make

00:37:01.090 --> 00:37:02.590
healthier food for kids, maybe.

00:37:02.590 --> 00:37:03.190
I don't know.

00:37:03.190 --> 00:37:06.313
It's kind of hard for me
to wrap my head around it.

00:37:06.313 --> 00:37:07.160
AUDIENCE: Cool

00:37:07.160 --> 00:37:08.770
BARBARA LYNCH: But
I love science.

00:37:08.770 --> 00:37:11.140
So I don't know.

00:37:11.140 --> 00:37:13.000
It's just not me.

00:37:13.000 --> 00:37:13.750
AUDIENCE: Awesome.

00:37:13.750 --> 00:37:15.010
BARBARA LYNCH: I'd
run out of time.

00:37:15.010 --> 00:37:15.790
AUDIENCE: Thanks.

00:37:15.790 --> 00:37:17.500
Sounds like you're not
into "see how tall you

00:37:17.500 --> 00:37:18.916
can make your
dishes on the plate"

00:37:18.916 --> 00:37:20.530
as well, which there
was that period--

00:37:20.530 --> 00:37:23.029
BARBARA LYNCH: By using the
most expensive Bernardaud China?

00:37:23.029 --> 00:37:26.255
No, I'm all right with that.

00:37:26.255 --> 00:37:28.630
AUDIENCE: When we talked about
the difference between you

00:37:28.630 --> 00:37:31.090
as a chef and an
entrepreneur, would you say,

00:37:31.090 --> 00:37:34.120
as an entrepreneur,
do you have a vision--

00:37:34.120 --> 00:37:36.500
like OK, five years,
10 years, I want x.

00:37:36.500 --> 00:37:38.860
Or are the new restaurants
a little bit more

00:37:38.860 --> 00:37:42.550
just like, OK,
inspiration, I need this?

00:37:42.550 --> 00:37:44.710
BARBARA LYNCH: As
an entrepreneur,

00:37:44.710 --> 00:37:46.142
I'm working on a--

00:37:46.142 --> 00:37:48.350
this formula for restaurants
right now has to change.

00:37:48.350 --> 00:37:51.200
It's not going to survive.

00:37:51.200 --> 00:37:54.640
So yeah, I'm working
on a new sort

00:37:54.640 --> 00:37:58.420
of idea of what a restaurant
formula would look like--

00:37:58.420 --> 00:38:00.730
self-sustainable restaurant.

00:38:00.730 --> 00:38:04.450
You might have to have
a whole building where

00:38:04.450 --> 00:38:09.490
indoor gardening,
slaughterhouse, retail--

00:38:09.490 --> 00:38:11.620
like a small Eataly, basically.

00:38:11.620 --> 00:38:18.420
But also, your staff,
apartments upstairs,

00:38:18.420 --> 00:38:20.930
stay, eat, and
shop kind of thing.

00:38:20.930 --> 00:38:24.510
That kind of thing, or
little mini agriturismos.

00:38:24.510 --> 00:38:26.250
Who knows?

00:38:26.250 --> 00:38:27.960
It's going to change.

00:38:27.960 --> 00:38:30.730
It can't sustain it this way.

00:38:30.730 --> 00:38:33.000
Or malls are declining.

00:38:33.000 --> 00:38:37.350
Maybe malls become the
new farmer's markets.

00:38:37.350 --> 00:38:40.440
But that's OK, because
it's evolution.

00:38:40.440 --> 00:38:42.220
So things are going to change.

00:38:42.220 --> 00:38:43.470
It's going to change.

00:38:43.470 --> 00:38:44.820
I love change.

00:38:44.820 --> 00:38:47.960
And I love
entrepreneurialship, too.

00:38:47.960 --> 00:38:52.250
So online banking for
women or under-privileged--

00:38:52.250 --> 00:38:53.300
let's get them started.

00:38:53.300 --> 00:38:55.184
I don't know.

00:38:55.184 --> 00:38:56.350
AUDIENCE: You've got seven--

00:38:56.350 --> 00:38:58.752
no, eight-- restaurants.

00:38:58.752 --> 00:38:59.710
You're an entrepreneur.

00:38:59.710 --> 00:39:00.584
You're starting more.

00:39:00.584 --> 00:39:04.030
How much do you actually
get to cook and where?

00:39:04.030 --> 00:39:05.740
BARBARA LYNCH: Good question.

00:39:05.740 --> 00:39:07.870
There's really no room
in the kitchen because

00:39:07.870 --> 00:39:08.980
of the chain of command.

00:39:08.980 --> 00:39:11.200
And if I'm in there
and get pulled away--

00:39:11.200 --> 00:39:13.840
if I start changing
menus on the line

00:39:13.840 --> 00:39:15.744
and get pulled away
for other projects,

00:39:15.744 --> 00:39:16.660
it's just a shit show.

00:39:16.660 --> 00:39:21.900
So I mentor the chefs at home.

00:39:21.900 --> 00:39:24.850
So I have them come
up like on a Tuesday.

00:39:24.850 --> 00:39:26.980
And I have a million cookbooks.

00:39:26.980 --> 00:39:33.190
So I get to hang out with one
from each restaurant alone.

00:39:33.190 --> 00:39:35.500
We pretty much will
read cookbooks all day.

00:39:35.500 --> 00:39:39.040
And I'll either cook with them,
or we'll go out to dinner.

00:39:39.040 --> 00:39:39.829
We'll go fishing.

00:39:39.829 --> 00:39:42.370
We'll go to the farmer's market,
or we'll go to certain farms

00:39:42.370 --> 00:39:44.800
that I like.

00:39:44.800 --> 00:39:46.690
And then the next
day, we'll generally

00:39:46.690 --> 00:39:49.344
cook for 10 random people.

00:39:49.344 --> 00:39:51.010
And then we hang out
again the next day,

00:39:51.010 --> 00:39:52.120
and we'll chit-chat more.

00:39:52.120 --> 00:39:58.380
And I get to really know
them heart and soul.

00:39:58.380 --> 00:40:02.560
And then we'll do it a few more
times from each restaurant.

00:40:02.560 --> 00:40:06.070
And that way, I get
a lot more out of it.

00:40:06.070 --> 00:40:09.310
I get to see how
they cook and where

00:40:09.310 --> 00:40:10.960
they want to go next
within the company

00:40:10.960 --> 00:40:13.180
or without, what
are their goals.

00:40:13.180 --> 00:40:16.810
And it's a much better way
to cook with them that way.

00:40:16.810 --> 00:40:18.970
I still love cooking.

00:40:18.970 --> 00:40:21.730
And I actually
entertain a lot at home.

00:40:21.730 --> 00:40:23.680
But my limit is six people.

00:40:23.680 --> 00:40:26.710
Six to eight is
the most to have--

00:40:26.710 --> 00:40:29.080
I like to have
good conversations.

00:40:29.080 --> 00:40:32.860
So I limit my china
and silverware.

00:40:32.860 --> 00:40:35.020
I don't want to have
any more than that.

00:40:35.020 --> 00:40:38.570
Usually 10 is the top.

00:40:38.570 --> 00:40:41.620
But that's just for
that dinner part--

00:40:41.620 --> 00:40:44.140
like that part of the dinner.

00:40:44.140 --> 00:40:45.160
Am I making sense?

00:40:45.160 --> 00:40:50.035
That's when we invite
the 10 people over max.

00:40:50.035 --> 00:40:53.559
So I'm picky like that.

00:40:53.559 --> 00:40:54.600
ADAM WILLIAMS: Good rule.

00:40:54.600 --> 00:40:54.980
BARBARA LYNCH: Yeah?

00:40:54.980 --> 00:40:55.390
ADAM WILLIAMS: Yeah.

00:40:55.390 --> 00:40:57.520
BARBARA LYNCH: Do you
like to cook at home?

00:40:57.520 --> 00:40:58.720
ADAM WILLIAMS: I do.

00:40:58.720 --> 00:41:00.240
I do.

00:41:00.240 --> 00:41:01.477
I'm sort of--

00:41:01.477 --> 00:41:02.310
BARBARA LYNCH: Busy?

00:41:02.310 --> 00:41:05.280
ADAM WILLIAMS: A little
bit, but also handcuffed.

00:41:05.280 --> 00:41:10.090
My wife is big
nutritional fan, so lot

00:41:10.090 --> 00:41:13.310
of quinoas and farros and stuff
like that and keep it simple.

00:41:13.310 --> 00:41:14.000
But I do.

00:41:14.000 --> 00:41:15.425
I love to cook at home.

00:41:15.425 --> 00:41:17.675
But I'm going to start
throwing out my silverware now.

00:41:17.675 --> 00:41:20.970
Like, I don't have
enough, sorry.

00:41:20.970 --> 00:41:22.470
Question?

00:41:22.470 --> 00:41:25.710
AUDIENCE: You mentioned
having humble upbringings

00:41:25.710 --> 00:41:28.110
and then having
a lot of success.

00:41:28.110 --> 00:41:31.170
Did you have to overcome
any guilt because of that?

00:41:33.840 --> 00:41:35.540
That make sense at all?

00:41:35.540 --> 00:41:37.050
BARBARA LYNCH: Guilt?

00:41:37.050 --> 00:41:38.550
I've always felt
like I'm a shortcut

00:41:38.550 --> 00:41:41.160
kid or, how do I get here?

00:41:41.160 --> 00:41:44.900
Like, oh, my god, yeah.

00:41:44.900 --> 00:41:48.870
Yeah, I still feel
a little shocked.

00:41:48.870 --> 00:41:50.880
I don't really
look at it anymore.

00:41:54.990 --> 00:41:58.590
I didn't really look at
what I've done up until now.

00:41:58.590 --> 00:42:00.320
But now I look at it
and go, oh, my god,

00:42:00.320 --> 00:42:04.530
I guess I've really
done a lot with--

00:42:04.530 --> 00:42:06.990
a lot of restaurants.

00:42:06.990 --> 00:42:11.320
And this whole time
thing, I was like, shit.

00:42:11.320 --> 00:42:14.010
An Uber guy said,
holy cow, there's

00:42:14.010 --> 00:42:17.280
70 billion people in the
world-- or 7 billion people

00:42:17.280 --> 00:42:18.534
in the world?

00:42:18.534 --> 00:42:19.950
I was like, oh,
god, don't tell me

00:42:19.950 --> 00:42:23.460
that, I really like my
world-- my really small world.

00:42:23.460 --> 00:42:26.270
So I can't think of--

00:42:26.270 --> 00:42:29.910
I don't think
about it like that.

00:42:29.910 --> 00:42:34.020
I think I still am in
a tunnel vision world.

00:42:34.020 --> 00:42:35.940
And I kind of like it.

00:42:35.940 --> 00:42:38.250
But I'm not done yet.

00:42:38.250 --> 00:42:40.290
So I guess that's it.

00:42:40.290 --> 00:42:42.100
I don't feel guilty
as much anymore.

00:42:42.100 --> 00:42:46.470
I feel more confident,
because I used

00:42:46.470 --> 00:42:50.040
to have those carrots
that I used to go after.

00:42:50.040 --> 00:42:54.600
Like I always wanted to be
Joel Robuchon or Alain Ducasse.

00:42:54.600 --> 00:42:57.910
And finally, finally, I
think at age 50, I said,

00:42:57.910 --> 00:42:59.910
I'm really happy to
be Barbara Lynch.

00:42:59.910 --> 00:43:03.800
So that's when you
know you're happy.

00:43:03.800 --> 00:43:05.920
But I'm not done.

00:43:05.920 --> 00:43:07.470
So yeah.

00:43:07.470 --> 00:43:10.620
So that's good-- good
to be not done yet.

00:43:10.620 --> 00:43:13.050
I haven't learned enough yet.

00:43:13.050 --> 00:43:19.818
So I love learning more,
if that makes sense.

00:43:19.818 --> 00:43:20.780
Hi.

00:43:20.780 --> 00:43:21.742
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:43:21.742 --> 00:43:22.704
Thank you for coming.

00:43:22.704 --> 00:43:24.680
BARBARA LYNCH: Oh, thank you.

00:43:24.680 --> 00:43:28.070
AUDIENCE: So as you've risen and
kind of expanded in your career

00:43:28.070 --> 00:43:30.740
and in Boston, what are
some of the hardest roles

00:43:30.740 --> 00:43:32.960
and jobs you've had
to give up to others

00:43:32.960 --> 00:43:34.750
or relinquish to your team?

00:43:34.750 --> 00:43:37.041
BARBARA LYNCH: Oh, I think
the hardest was stepping out

00:43:37.041 --> 00:43:38.010
of the kitchen.

00:43:38.010 --> 00:43:41.270
I think I felt like
a year, I was like--

00:43:41.270 --> 00:43:43.520
I floundered for a year.

00:43:43.520 --> 00:43:46.530
That's when I felt the
guiltiest-- leaving the kitchen

00:43:46.530 --> 00:43:51.350
and still wearing a chef's
coat and just walking

00:43:51.350 --> 00:43:53.970
around and feeling useless.

00:43:53.970 --> 00:43:58.670
When I say, there is
no room on the line,

00:43:58.670 --> 00:44:00.610
there were times I
jumped in on the line

00:44:00.610 --> 00:44:03.940
and would send somebody
out, get off the line.

00:44:03.940 --> 00:44:08.510
And it just kind of causes
a lot of chaos and stuff.

00:44:08.510 --> 00:44:09.710
But believe me, I did it.

00:44:09.710 --> 00:44:12.620
And I will do it if
I still feel like--

00:44:12.620 --> 00:44:18.020
if anyone's literally
not cooking correctly.

00:44:18.020 --> 00:44:20.810
But I think that's
just letting go.

00:44:20.810 --> 00:44:23.870
You have to let go and delegate.

00:44:23.870 --> 00:44:28.100
That's when you got to really
find your voice and be tougher.

00:44:28.100 --> 00:44:31.550
That's when you've got
to really find that voice

00:44:31.550 --> 00:44:36.680
to say, oh, my god, how many
times did I fucking tell you,

00:44:36.680 --> 00:44:42.730
Jesus, I hate mesclun salad.

00:44:42.730 --> 00:44:44.780
There are vegetable
salads you can--

00:44:44.780 --> 00:44:50.030
that is when you have
to say, third time, I'm

00:44:50.030 --> 00:44:54.140
not saying it again,
because I still

00:44:54.140 --> 00:44:56.540
do the menus with the chefs.

00:44:56.540 --> 00:45:04.700
And now I draw them and
paint them and write it out.

00:45:04.700 --> 00:45:07.285
And what part of that
did you not understand?

00:45:07.285 --> 00:45:09.410
Then you got to get tougher
and tougher and tougher

00:45:09.410 --> 00:45:11.970
and tougher.

00:45:11.970 --> 00:45:14.370
And that took a few years.

00:45:14.370 --> 00:45:18.380
So I think that was the
toughest challenge for me

00:45:18.380 --> 00:45:23.261
to really switch that position.

00:45:23.261 --> 00:45:25.010
But you have to do it
if you want to grow.

00:45:25.010 --> 00:45:26.300
And you have to delegate.

00:45:26.300 --> 00:45:29.630
And that's when you
have to get tough.

00:45:29.630 --> 00:45:31.620
So that was the tough part.

00:45:31.620 --> 00:45:32.120
And

00:45:32.120 --> 00:45:35.660
Accept it that you are
a businesswoman as well.

00:45:35.660 --> 00:45:38.840
Chef owner slash businesswoman--
but the chef owner

00:45:38.840 --> 00:45:41.800
comes first and
then businesswoman.

00:45:41.800 --> 00:45:44.690
And you have to remember it.

00:45:44.690 --> 00:45:46.600
AUDIENCE: Great.

00:45:46.600 --> 00:45:48.040
Thanks, everyone, for coming.

00:45:48.040 --> 00:45:49.840
BARBARA LYNCH: Oh,
my god, thank you.

00:45:49.840 --> 00:45:50.440
ADAM WILLIAMS: Thank you.

00:45:50.440 --> 00:45:50.790
BARBARA LYNCH: Thanks.

00:45:50.790 --> 00:45:51.456
Great questions.

00:45:51.456 --> 00:45:54.060
