00:00:01.254 --> 00:00:07.340
 I told you before that any number raised to force 0 equals 1 

00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:09.420
 If x ^ 0 = 1 

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:13.140
 I gave you a proof explaining this situation 

00:00:13.140 --> 00:00:16.910
 If we have 3 ^ 1 

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:19.250
 It will equal 3 

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:21.870
 3 ^ 2 = 9 

00:00:21.870 --> 00:00:24.940
 3 ^ 3 = 27 

00:00:24.940 --> 00:00:28.480
 If each time we lower the value of the force, we divide by 3 

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:30.170
 27 3 3 = 9 

00:00:30.170 --> 00:00:32.390
 9 3 3 = 3 

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:34.890
 Then 3 3 3 = 1 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:37.930
 So we get the output of 3 ^ 0 

00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:40.980
 This is the way we think 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:43.640
 We will need this way to think 

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:45.920
 How the characteristics of the foundations work 

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:52.840
 For example, I told you that a ^ b × a ^ c 

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:57.180
 = a ^ b + c 

00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:59.440
 Now, what will happen if it is c = 0 

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:04.430
 Or what happens if we have a ^ b × a ^ 0? 

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:08.210
 Well, according to this property, these will be equal 

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:13.670
 a ^ b + 0, which equals a ^ b 

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:18.850
 If a ^ b × a ^ 0 = a ^ b 

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:21.290
 If you divide the parties on a - let me rewrite 

00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:25.610
 This is - a ^ b × a ^ 0, if we use this property 

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:30.370
 The output would be a ^ b, would not it? b + 0 = b 

00:01:30.370 --> 00:01:37.460
 If you divide the two sides on a ^ b, what do you get? 

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:39.020
 In the left side, we will have 

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:41.450
 a ^ 0, right? 

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:42.900
 These are deleted 

00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:46.210
 a ^ 0 = 1 

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:48.570
 You can use a similar proof that applies to all 

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:51.400
 Characteristics of bases, in which the numbers are raised to the force 0 

00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:53.385
 Equal to 1 

00:01:53.385 --> 00:01:58.080
 This is logical when we divide on 3, every step we take 

00:01:58.080 --> 00:01:59.310
 Decrease the value of the exponent 

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:00.820
 And will always succeed 

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:04.610
 When we have 3 ^ -1, we have seen this in 

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:07.980
 The last offer is equal to 1/3 ^ 1 

00:02:07.980 --> 00:02:10.259
 Or 1/3 

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:12.360
 If again, move from 3 to 0 to 1/3 

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:13.710
 We divide by 3 at a time 

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:16.660
 If this is so logical to some degree where that 

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:19.100
 3 ^ 0 = 1 

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:21.570
 But that makes a gap 

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:24.930
 What is the output of 0 ^ 0? 

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:27.460
 This is a strange idea 

00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:30.700
 That is, we will beat 0 by itself 0 times 

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:32.890
 This depends on the context you use 

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:37.160
 Sometimes people can say that the value is not known, but others 

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:39.270
 They are many, at least in my area of ​​expertise, they will say that output 

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:40.525
 Equals 1 

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:45.440
 The reason - though this is not 

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:47.870
 Obviously, you can write 0 ^ 0 at 

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:49.920
 The search engine is online and will give you a result 

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:52.660
 Even if it is not obvious, the reason 

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:55.350
 The output ID in this way is 

00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:56.450
 The success of some formulas 

00:02:56.450 --> 00:03:00.130
 One formula is the two-edged equation 

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:02.190
 This will work when you find a double-edged equation, and I will not explain it 

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:05.630
 Now, if the bottom line is 0 ^ 0 = 1 

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:08.160
 This is interesting and you have to think about what 

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:11.020
 Means? 

00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:12.830
 Let us now talk a bit about other characteristics 

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:15.850
 So we can use them all when you do a group solution 

00:03:15.850 --> 00:03:18.250
 Of the questions, I have told you in the last offer what 

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:20.080
 It means that a number is raised to a negative force 

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:23.290
 a ^ -1, or maybe I should say 

00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:28.560
 a ^ -b = 1 / a ^ b 

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:32.570
 Let's apply this to a set of realistic examples 

00:03:32.570 --> 00:03:37.620
 3 ^ -3 = 1/3 ^ 3 

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:42.530
 It is equal to 1/3 × 3 × 3 

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:46.590
 Ie = 1/27 

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:55.490
 If I ask you what is the output of 1/3 ^ -2? 

00:03:55.490 --> 00:04:00.830
 Well, that's worth it 

00:04:00.830 --> 00:04:01.950
 1/1/3 ^ 2 

00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:04.130
 We get rid of the negative and turn it over 

00:04:04.130 --> 00:04:08.350
 1 / - 

00:04:08.350 --> 00:04:10.090
 How much output 1/3 × 1/3? 

00:04:10.090 --> 00:04:11.470
 1/9 

00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:14.090
 Equally - this is 1 1 1/9 = 

00:04:14.090 --> 00:04:17.870
 1 × 9, if = 9 

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:23.210
 This is very logical, because 1/3, remember, 1/3 

00:04:23.210 --> 00:04:27.010
 Is equal to 3 ^ -1, is not it? 

00:04:27.010 --> 00:04:31.930
 3 ^ -1 = 1/3 ^ 1 

00:04:31.930 --> 00:04:34.040
 Equal to 1/3 

00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:37.980
 If we compensate for 1/3 B3 ^ -1, the output is 

00:04:37.980 --> 00:04:41.670
 (3 ^ -1) ^ - 2 

00:04:41.670 --> 00:04:43.760
 These words are equal 

00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:46.850
 If we use one of the properties we learned in 

00:04:46.850 --> 00:04:48.410
 The first lesson, we will get an output 

00:04:48.410 --> 00:04:49.480
 These are the disadvantages 

00:04:49.480 --> 00:04:53.480
 If it equals 3 ^ -1, × -2 

00:04:53.480 --> 00:04:57.000
 It becomes positive 2, and the result is 9 

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:00.290
 This is something structured as all the characteristics of the foundations 

00:05:00.290 --> 00:05:03.840
 Connected to each other in a beautiful way, no 

00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:04.890
 Conflict with each other 

00:05:04.890 --> 00:05:07.330
 It does not matter which feature you use, in the end you'll get it 

00:05:07.330 --> 00:05:09.360
 On the right answer, as long as you do not 

00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:11.060
 No error 

00:05:11.060 --> 00:05:14.370
 Now, the last thing I would define is a concept 

00:05:14.370 --> 00:05:16.970
 Assi Al Kasri 

00:05:16.970 --> 00:05:21.980
 If we had a number raised to a breaking force - suppose that 

00:05:21.980 --> 00:05:27.040
 We have a ^ 1 / b 

00:05:27.040 --> 00:05:28.380
 I'll know that 

00:05:28.380 --> 00:05:33.150
 This equals the root of the b for a 

00:05:33.150 --> 00:05:36.690
 So let me be clearer here 

00:05:36.690 --> 00:05:38.520
 I will use the numbers here 

00:05:38.520 --> 00:05:44.250
 If I say 4 ^ 1/2, that means 

00:05:44.250 --> 00:05:49.920
 Square root of 4 

00:05:49.920 --> 00:05:54.180
 This is equal, if intended as the root of course 

00:05:54.180 --> 00:05:57.070
 Equals 2 

00:05:57.070 --> 00:06:02.460
 If I say, I'll be clear, MRI 

00:06:02.460 --> 00:06:05.020
 This is equivalent to Cubic root of 8 

00:06:05.020 --> 00:06:07.780
 And that, to some degree, is one of the things 

00:06:07.780 --> 00:06:09.560
 The nuisance in the foundations 

00:06:09.560 --> 00:06:12.740
 Here I say, what is the number that if hit him himself 3 times 

00:06:12.740 --> 00:06:15.720
 Will be 8? 

00:06:15.720 --> 00:06:23.540
 If you assume that x = 8 ^ 1/3, this is 

00:06:23.540 --> 00:06:27.520
 Equivalent to x ^ 3 

00:06:27.520 --> 00:06:30.320
 = 8 

00:06:30.320 --> 00:06:32.930
 How can I know that these two phrases are equal? 

00:06:32.930 --> 00:06:34.950
 Well, I can lift both ends of the equation 

00:06:34.950 --> 00:06:36.930
 Force 3 

00:06:36.930 --> 00:06:39.340
 If applied on the left side and raised to force 3 

00:06:39.340 --> 00:06:41.520
 And then the right side, what will I get? 

00:06:41.520 --> 00:06:43.710
 On the left side, I'll get x ^ 3 

00:06:43.710 --> 00:06:48.715
 The right side, get 8 ^ 1/3 × 3 

00:06:48.715 --> 00:06:52.130
 Ie 3/3, equal to 1 

00:06:52.130 --> 00:06:58.860
 If x = 8 ^ 1/3, what is x? 

00:06:58.860 --> 00:07:02.960
 Well, 2 × 2 × 2 = 8 

00:07:02.960 --> 00:07:05.160
 There is no easy way, especially when dealing with 

00:07:05.160 --> 00:07:07.540
 Root IV, or V, or when we have decimal numbers 

00:07:07.540 --> 00:07:08.260
 For her account 

00:07:08.260 --> 00:07:11.850
 You will probably need most of the time to calculator to help you calculate this 

00:07:11.850 --> 00:07:15.560
 But numbers such as 8 ^ 1/3, or 16 ^ 1/4, or 27 ^ 1/3 

00:07:15.560 --> 00:07:19.970
 Not difficult to calculate 

00:07:19.970 --> 00:07:23.250
 If this, I'll be clear, = 2 

00:07:23.250 --> 00:07:27.700
 Now, let's make things a little harder 

00:07:27.700 --> 00:07:35.390
 How much product 27 ^ -1 / 3? 

00:07:35.390 --> 00:07:37.120
 Do not worry too much 

00:07:37.120 --> 00:07:39.230
 I will solve it step by step 

00:07:39.230 --> 00:07:44.800
 When we have negative power, this is 

00:07:44.800 --> 00:07:52.560
 Equals 1/27 ^ 1/33 

00:07:52.560 --> 00:07:53.590
 These are equal 

00:07:53.590 --> 00:07:55.010
 We get rid of the negative signal and get the 

00:07:55.010 --> 00:07:56.380
 1 / All this 

00:07:56.380 --> 00:08:01.170
 Then what is the output of 27 ^ 1/3? 

00:08:01.170 --> 00:08:05.590
 Well, what is the number that if you hit it yourself 3 times you get 27? 

00:08:05.590 --> 00:08:06.690
 It's 3 

00:08:06.690 --> 00:08:10.330
 This is equal to 1/3 

00:08:10.330 --> 00:08:11.860
 Not bad 

00:08:11.860 --> 00:08:14.770
 Now I will be a little more difficult 

00:08:14.770 --> 00:08:17.280
 To become a bit arduous 

00:08:21.590 --> 00:08:22.980
 Let me solve an interesting example 

00:08:22.980 --> 00:08:32.289
 How much output 8 ^ 2/3? 

00:08:32.289 --> 00:08:35.700
 This sounds scary 

00:08:35.700 --> 00:08:39.770
 All you have to remember is that this is similar 

00:08:39.770 --> 00:08:42.490
 It can be solved using base rules 

00:08:42.490 --> 00:08:46.870
 It is the same (8 ^ 2) ^ 1/3 

00:08:46.870 --> 00:08:47.680
 How do I know this? 

00:08:47.680 --> 00:08:51.560
 Well, if you hit those two 

00:08:51.560 --> 00:08:55.690
 If 8 ^ 2/3 equals 8 ^ 2, then 

00:08:55.690 --> 00:08:57.250
 We raise the whole amount of force 3 

00:08:57.250 --> 00:08:58.450
 But we can imagine it in another way 

00:08:58.450 --> 00:09:04.200
 This is equal to (8 ^ 1/3) ^ 2 

00:09:04.200 --> 00:09:06.540
 Because any way we use it, when we hit the foundations 

00:09:06.540 --> 00:09:08.760
 We'll get 8 ^ 2/3 

00:09:08.760 --> 00:09:11.850
 Let's check that we are 

00:09:11.850 --> 00:09:13.310
 We will get the same value 

00:09:13.310 --> 00:09:15.840
 If 8 ^ 2 = 64 

00:09:15.840 --> 00:09:18.090
 Then we increase the amount of force 1/3 

00:09:18.090 --> 00:09:20.410
 We have here, 8 ^ 1/3 

00:09:20.410 --> 00:09:21.590
 We have already created the output 

00:09:21.590 --> 00:09:24.650
 Equals 2, because 2 ^ 3 = 8 

00:09:24.650 --> 00:09:29.050
 If it is 2 ^ 2 

00:09:29.050 --> 00:09:30.950
 Now, how much output is 64 ^ 1/3? 

00:09:30.950 --> 00:09:34.620
 What is the number that you hit yourself 3 times, giving you the output 64? 

00:09:34.620 --> 00:09:39.830
 Well, 4 × 4 × 4 = 64, or 4 ^ 3 

00:09:39.830 --> 00:09:46.230
 = 64, which means 4 = 

00:09:46.230 --> 00:09:49.360
 64/1/3 

00:09:49.360 --> 00:09:51.710
 Equals 4 

00:09:51.710 --> 00:09:55.400
 Luckily, 2 ^ 2 also equals 4 

00:09:55.400 --> 00:09:56.730
 So the way we follow is not important 

00:09:56.730 --> 00:09:59.760
 Where you can take the square root and then the cube root, or 

00:09:59.760 --> 00:10:02.200
 You can take the third root and then square it 

00:10:02.200 --> 00:10:05.740
 And you will get the same output 

00:10:05.740 --> 00:10:06.830
 Now, everything I have dealt with 

00:10:06.830 --> 00:10:07.920
 It was actual numbers 

00:10:07.920 --> 00:10:11.020
 Let me now deal with issues 

00:10:11.020 --> 00:10:14.662
 Contains variables 

00:10:14.662 --> 00:10:18.180
 So we want to take some phrases and 

00:10:18.180 --> 00:10:19.220
 Make sure that 

00:10:19.220 --> 00:10:20.980
 The output is non-negative 

00:10:20.980 --> 00:10:28.140
 So let me say x + 3 / x ^ -7 

00:10:28.140 --> 00:10:30.410
 This issue can be seen in several ways 

00:10:30.410 --> 00:10:35.460
 We can consider it x ^ 3 × 1 

00:10:35.460 --> 00:10:38.390
 / x ^ -7 

00:10:38.390 --> 00:10:42.150
 How much output 1 / x ^ -7? 

00:10:42.150 --> 00:10:49.890
 This equals x ^ 7, right? 

00:10:49.890 --> 00:10:52.570
 If we have 1 divided by a number, you can get rid of the 1 

00:10:52.570 --> 00:10:54.370
 By placing a negative signal against the exponent 

00:10:54.370 --> 00:10:55.630
 But if you put a negative signal against 

00:10:55.630 --> 00:10:58.020
 -7, you get x ^ 7 

00:10:58.020 --> 00:11:02.550
 This can be simplified to become x ^ -3 × 

00:11:02.550 --> 00:11:04.540
 x ^ 7 

00:11:04.540 --> 00:11:07.480
 And then we can gather the foundations, so we have 

00:11:07.480 --> 00:11:08.870
 x ^ 4 

00:11:08.870 --> 00:11:12.150
 Now we'll use another method, which is a really logical way 

00:11:12.150 --> 00:11:16.300
 Where we can lay the foundations 

00:11:16.300 --> 00:11:18.520
 Well, we have the same foundation 

00:11:18.520 --> 00:11:22.660
 So we have x ^ -3 

00:11:22.660 --> 00:11:24.390
 - - 7 

00:11:24.390 --> 00:11:27.390
 Well, 3 - 7, is equal 

00:11:27.390 --> 00:11:33.920
 3 + 7 = x ^ 4 

00:11:33.920 --> 00:11:36.600
 And the latter way, - I mean, it exists 

00:11:36.600 --> 00:11:38.275
 More than one way can be followed here 

00:11:38.275 --> 00:11:41.280
 We can say x ^ 3 / 

00:11:41.280 --> 00:11:46.140
 x ^ -7-- Sorry, not -x - 

00:11:46.140 --> 00:11:47.370
 / x ^ -7 

00:11:47.370 --> 00:11:50.220
 Well, x ^ -3 equals 1 / x ^ 3 

00:11:50.220 --> 00:11:55.710
 This phrase - x 1 / x ^ -7 

00:11:55.710 --> 00:11:59.330
 If this equals 

00:11:59.330 --> 00:12:03.350
 1 / x ^ 3 × x ^ -7 

00:12:03.350 --> 00:12:07.470
 You can collect the foundations, and become 

00:12:07.470 --> 00:12:10.350
 1/3 - 7 = x ^ -4 

00:12:10.350 --> 00:12:13.480
 And then - if we get rid of the inverse, we take 

00:12:13.480 --> 00:12:15.890
 Inverted, we can put a negative signal for this 

00:12:15.890 --> 00:12:18.480
 Negative, and becomes positive - so it is 

00:12:18.480 --> 00:12:20.510
 Output x ^ 4 

00:12:20.510 --> 00:12:22.960
 If it does not matter the way we follow, in case we are consistent with 

00:12:22.960 --> 00:12:27.150
 The rules, we'll get x ^ 4 

00:12:27.150 --> 00:12:29.770
 Let us now resolve a complex issue 

00:12:29.770 --> 00:12:32.710
 And then I thought we would have done what was required of us today 

00:12:32.710 --> 00:12:43.690
 To move: 3x ^ 2 × y ^ 3/2 

00:12:43.690 --> 00:12:51.250
 We will divide it by x × y ^ 1/2 

00:12:51.250 --> 00:12:56.130
 Again, this equates to 3 x x expressions 

00:12:56.130 --> 00:13:03.070
 If 3 × x ^ 2 / x × y ^ 3/2 

00:13:03.070 --> 00:13:04.690
 / y ^ 1/2 

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:14.260
 Well, this equals 3 × - how much value 

00:13:14.260 --> 00:13:15.920
 x ^ 2 / x? 

00:13:15.920 --> 00:13:18.910
 Or x ^ 2 / x ^ 1? 

00:13:18.910 --> 00:13:24.080
 This is equal to x ^ 2 - 1 

00:13:24.080 --> 00:13:31.520
 And then these become y ^ 3/2 - 1/2 

00:13:31.520 --> 00:13:32.790
 So what is the final product? 

00:13:32.790 --> 00:13:35.990
 It's 3 x x 

00:13:35.990 --> 00:13:41.520
 2 - 1 = 1 - and can type x here - × 3/2 

00:13:41.520 --> 00:13:43.980
 - 1/2 = 2/2 

00:13:43.980 --> 00:13:45.670
 If y ^ 2/2 equals 

00:13:45.670 --> 00:13:49.570
 2/2 are the same y 

00:13:49.570 --> 00:13:53.040
 This is worth 3xy 

00:13:53.040 --> 00:13:54.580
 However, I advise you to solve more 

00:13:54.580 --> 00:13:55.800
 Examples of this 

00:13:55.800 --> 00:13:57.880
 But you'll see that this is just the use of rules that 

00:13:57.880 --> 00:14:00.350
 I explained it in the final lessons, so that you can 

00:14:00.350 --> 00:14:03.760
 To simplify any exponential phrase 

99:59:59.999 --> 100:00:02.465
 That's all I have now, see you soon 

99:59:59.999 --> 100:00:04.999
 I have told you in many lessons that any number raised to 0 is equal to 1
