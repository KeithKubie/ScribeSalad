00:00:00.249 --> 00:00:02.980
(upbeat music)

00:00:02.980 --> 00:00:04.860
- It's Academy Award season which means

00:00:04.860 --> 00:00:06.440
that all of Hollywood is buzzing

00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:09.430
about that famous golden guy, Oscar.

00:00:09.430 --> 00:00:11.220
And this year there's
more reason than ever

00:00:11.220 --> 00:00:14.620
to want to get your hands on
one of the coveted statuettes.

00:00:14.620 --> 00:00:18.823
For the first time in 50
years, Oscar will have a penis.

00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:22.360
Meet Heinrich Baronowski,

00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:25.540
a man who has spent his life with Oscar.

00:00:25.540 --> 00:00:28.430
In 1929, his father handcrafted

00:00:28.430 --> 00:00:31.000
the first ever Oscar statuette.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:32.540
As soon as he was old enough,

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:34.870
Heinrich began sculpting
the statues himself.

00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:37.981
Stan, what would you say your
grandfather's specialty is?

00:00:37.981 --> 00:00:41.051
- (foreign language)

00:00:41.051 --> 00:00:44.010
- No doubt, it's the penis.

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:45.220
- Penis.

00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:47.120
- The lines of the penis,

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:48.840
the shape of the penis,

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:51.140
the shining of the penis.

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:54.360
The penis is his passion, his pride.

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:55.360
It's his everything.

00:00:58.193 --> 00:00:59.450
(chuckling)

00:00:59.450 --> 00:01:01.920
- [Host] From 1929 to 1950,

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:05.040
every Oscar was crafted
in the Baronowski style,

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:07.270
complete with a tiny penis.

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:09.000
- As you can see here,

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:10.878
this is a droopier-

00:01:10.878 --> 00:01:12.620
- (foreign language)

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:14.990
- European style penis.

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:16.776
From around 1933.

00:01:16.776 --> 00:01:17.709
- [Host] Mhmm.

00:01:17.709 --> 00:01:20.390
- (foreign language)

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:22.920
- Oh, this Oscar, which is from 1938,

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:24.669
has a corkscrew penis.

00:01:24.669 --> 00:01:25.502
- Okay.

00:01:25.502 --> 00:01:28.585
- (foreign language)

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:32.020
- Spun. Corkscrew. Yeah.

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:33.080
- Spun penis.

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:34.220
- Of course, yeah.

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:36.070
- Oh and this is a very rare Oscar

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:37.717
with a stiff erect penis.

00:01:37.717 --> 00:01:38.950
- Wow.

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:41.880
Which was only made for
one year and that was 1945.

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:44.059
- To celebrate the end of World War II?

00:01:44.059 --> 00:01:47.728
- (foreign language)

00:01:47.728 --> 00:01:49.368
- No.

00:01:49.368 --> 00:01:50.690
- No.

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:53.530
- [Host] Sadly, in 1950
Heinrich began to suffer

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:56.520
from arthritis, making it
difficult for him to perform

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:59.830
the precise delicate movements
necessary for sculpting

00:01:59.830 --> 00:02:01.875
Oscar's detailed penis.

00:02:01.875 --> 00:02:02.708
- (foreign language)

00:02:02.708 --> 00:02:04.700
- He says with his dexterity gone

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:07.796
it was difficult to craft the penis.

00:02:07.796 --> 00:02:09.880
- (foreign language)

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:12.430
- Oh, he said, dick-sterity.

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:14.270
- [Host] For years, it
seemed as though the world

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:16.640
would never again see Oscar's genitals.

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:18.700
But all that changed earlier this year

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:22.490
when Heinrich underwent an
experimental hand transplant.

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:24.732
With the new hand, Heinrich
could once again return

00:02:24.732 --> 00:02:26.960
to the penis sculpting he loved.

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:29.280
The Academy took notice and last winter

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:31.244
Heinrich got the call
he'd been waiting for.

00:02:31.244 --> 00:02:32.077
- (foreign language)

00:02:32.077 --> 00:02:35.881
- He said to me, hello are you
the sculptor of Oscar penis?

00:02:35.881 --> 00:02:38.590
- (foreign language)

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:41.870
- And I said, yes. Yes, I make
the penis for the golden man.

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:44.953
- (foreign language)

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:48.403
- And then they asked me to come back.

00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:54.312
(foreign language)

00:02:54.312 --> 00:02:55.969
Sorry.

00:02:55.969 --> 00:02:56.802
- (foreign language)

00:02:56.802 --> 00:03:01.280
- If he could make small
golden penises all day long

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:03.550
and into the night for
the rest of his days,

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:04.903
he would die happy.

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:07.307
- I hope you do die that way.

00:03:10.135 --> 00:03:11.420
I want you to die

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:12.860
that way.

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:13.910
- Thank you.

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:16.480
Heinrich, Stan, thank you both so much

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:17.990
for joining us.

00:03:17.990 --> 00:03:20.883
And for Entertainment
Spotlight, I'm Kay Donnely.

00:03:21.998 --> 00:03:24.581
