00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:02.531
All right,
we're rounding to two decimal places.

00:00:02.531 --> 00:00:04.356
So here's the second decimal place.

00:00:04.356 --> 00:00:06.600
Let's look to the right to 5.

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:08.390
The 5 means that we round up.

00:00:08.390 --> 00:00:13.774
So our answer is $67.58.
