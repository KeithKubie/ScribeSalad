00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:01.512
As we can see, one of the more

00:00:01.512 --> 00:00:05.130
important things about the processor is power consumption. There

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:08.400
are really two kinds of power that a processor

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:12.040
consumes. There is dynamic power which is the power

00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:15.680
consumed by actual activity in an electronic circuit.

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:18.840
But there is also static power which is consumed

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:21.684
when the circuit is powered on but idle, so

00:00:21.684 --> 00:00:25.272
it's not really doing much. We will discuss both

00:00:25.272 --> 00:00:27.978
the dynamic and static power and also how they are

00:00:27.978 --> 00:00:31.380
related to each other and how do they affect processor speed
