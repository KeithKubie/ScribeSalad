00:00:11.060 --> 00:00:12.380
 Maybe in the history of fine art 

00:00:12.380 --> 00:00:15.580
 Diego Velasquez's Menin (or "Flippin's Family") 

00:00:15.580 --> 00:00:19.940
 the table that needs to be analyzed 

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:21.600
 little ones 

00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:25.560
 Even though the painter lives at the end of his life, while the masterpiece we talk about 

00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:29.260
 He was at the highest point of his creations. Therefore, 

00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:33.500
 all his talents, experience, thoughts 

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:35.840
 skillfully skirt over the canvas. 

00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:40.400
 At that time, Velasquez was a court painter working for the Spanish king IV Philip, 

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:42.400
 He has been in this post for more than thirty years. 

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:44.400
 He was, of course, the Philippines's favorite artist, 

00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:46.100
 has repeatedly drawn his portrait, 

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:48.400
 both the salary and the rank of the president have gradually risen. 

00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:50.560
 The artist, who is the palace manager, 

00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:54.380
 The great Alkasar palace in Madriddin 

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:56.380
 decorated with his own works of art. 

00:00:56.380 --> 00:00:58.380
 Not surprisingly, for the masterpiece 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:01.860
 Velasquez himself is best known in the palace 

00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:03.380
 space - personally chosen 

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:08.740
 the workshop decorated with works. 

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:13.300
 At present, it is difficult to see what is described in these paintings, but it is well-known that the space conformity 

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:17.360
 and the selection of these works is not accidental. 

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:19.160
 But after a while ... 

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:22.360
 First, let's look at the general picture: 

00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:24.880
 Very detailed details; 

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:27.700
 Perhaps, first of all, the little girl draws attention, 

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:28.820
 Margaret Therese. 

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:31.660
 The only surviving king of the king. 

00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:36.360
 Or maybe you see the mirror of the king and the queen. 

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:42.960
 Or, first, six of the top 9 images are in focus, 

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:47.060
 They look at you in the background as if you were in the background. 

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:51.320
 This element alone gives the impression of painting, 

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:53.060
 you know, you've froze that moment ... 

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:57.280
 Velasquez described a moment as some of the figures 

00:01:57.280 --> 00:01:59.140
 he saw something and his attention was disturbed. 

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:01.500
 These three are still unaware ... 

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:06.300
 The little princess looks just at her eyes. 

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:09.580
 It involves spontaneity in the scene, 

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:12.860
 The entire composition of the image is interesting. 

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:16.500
 Every figure described in the group is unique. 

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:19.380
 What does Velasquez have in this 11-person team? 

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:21.720
 Including the mirror of the queen and the queen 

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:26.260
 unusual similarities and contradictions have been created. 

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:29.960
 This makes the eyes look more detailed on the canvas. 

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:35.280
 The first interesting point is the dual and triple groups. 

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:39.120
 Each figure, apart from the shahzad, is a couple. 

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:41.100
 Male and female dwarfs, 

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:43.060
 two backhanders standing behind, 

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:46.800
 The royal mausoleum, standing in the roof of the girl and the rear corridor, 

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:48.860
 the king and the queen on the mirror 

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:52.320
 and a girl who bows down with Velasquez and gives a drink to the queen. 

00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:56.180
 Each of these dual figures consists of women and men. 

00:02:56.180 --> 00:03:00.740
 The distinctive accent is the only lady in the center of the stage. 

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:04.660
 However, the images can also be grouped into three groups: 

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:11.100
 Prince and two assistants, dogs and two dwarfs, with two men in charge of the palace 

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:14.300
 the man in the corridor, the artist and the pair of mirrors. 

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:19.100
 There are two types of triangular shapes in both groups 

00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:21.780
 and all of them are described on the same horizontal surface. 

00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:27.360
 This 6-person group also creates a three-dimensional illustration by expanding the scope of the painting. 

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:32.400
 The views are moving from the Velaskes in the front to the court officer in the background, 

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:37.440
 because both are in the same black lipstick and are on the same line with the rear doors. 

00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:41.360
 The palace workers (escortists) are pictured at the same level as the kings and caricatures in the middle, 

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:47.200
 here we draw the imaginary Z axis along the entire drawing 

00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:50.000
 at first glance, the depth will be unseen. 

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:51.300
 This is vase ... 

00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:56.040
 Most people do not know that the dual and triple motifs are on the back wall 

00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:58.040
 in the drawing frame. 

00:03:58.040 --> 00:04:03.220
 The mirror between the two large canvas and two door frames above 

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:09.120
 The frames of the following three are matched with the prince and his two servants, 

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:13.500
 naturally, from the royal and queen to their daughter. 

00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:20.720
 However, at the same time, the views pass from the mirror to the illuminated corridor, where the officer stands. 

00:04:21.240 --> 00:04:27.040
 This illuminated rectangular part is on the same size as the mirror and is on the same line. 

00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:32.920
 Indeed, the brightness of the corridor differs from the light-reflecting image of the small martyrs 

00:04:32.920 --> 00:04:35.720
 and therefore relatively little attention. 

00:04:36.220 --> 00:04:41.260
 These three elements of the "Menin" are the main focal points. 

00:04:41.540 --> 00:04:48.120
 In contrast to the "Last Supper" in which all the figures are depicted around Jesus, 

00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:54.680
 "Menin" is tricky, leaving the audience unstable between a few center of gravity. 

00:04:54.980 --> 00:04:59.420
 The royal family of Velaskes, the court painter of the royal family, and their daughter 

00:04:59.420 --> 00:05:01.760
 it is clear why he does not focus on the whole. 

00:05:02.440 --> 00:05:05.020
 What is the importance of the corridor behind? 

00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:10.520
 There were long disputes around the mirror on the wall. 

00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:13.820
 What side does the autumn reflect? 

00:05:14.440 --> 00:05:18.700
 It is a natural reflection of the royal and queen, standing opposite to some of the critics, 

00:05:18.700 --> 00:05:24.200
 as if the artist had put the audience in their place. 

00:05:24.900 --> 00:05:29.160
 However, a thorough analysis from the other perspective shows that, 

00:05:29.160 --> 00:05:31.140
 where the other side is reflected. 

00:05:31.720 --> 00:05:36.780
 The weakening of the men is not here, but here - 

00:05:36.780 --> 00:05:39.680
 at the door of the illuminated corridor to the right. 

00:05:40.180 --> 00:05:46.240
 What does this mean? That is, the drawings are not in front of the mirror, 

00:05:46.240 --> 00:05:53.060
 they are facing the door. In the mirror, they are directly reflected, but not under a certain angle. 

00:05:53.380 --> 00:05:57.940
 That angle is a point of view of the Men from the invisible aspect - 

00:05:58.420 --> 00:06:01.140
 It reflects Velasquez's flax. 

00:06:02.020 --> 00:06:05.880
 Now let's go back to the two paintings above, as we mentioned earlier. 

00:06:06.540 --> 00:06:11.780
 These are the works of Velasquez's puppet, Peter Paul Rubens. 

00:06:11.780 --> 00:06:16.820
 Both reflect similar stories in Ovidi's Metamorphoses. 

00:06:16.820 --> 00:06:22.200
 In the painting on the right, the mortal Marsias entered the flute to the god Apollon. 

00:06:22.340 --> 00:06:27.620
 On the left, the divine Athina competes with the mortal Araxna. 

00:06:28.100 --> 00:06:34.540
 In other words, two races between humans and gods have been described. 

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:40.340
 Marsias is defeated, and Araxne is winning, but in the end both are punished by the gods. 

00:06:40.340 --> 00:06:44.980
 Because they do not understand the godliness of coping with craftsmanship. 

00:06:44.980 --> 00:06:49.700
 These stories also apply to Menin, which is a kind, 

00:06:49.700 --> 00:06:52.800
 painting on painting. 

00:06:53.400 --> 00:06:59.880
 During the Velasquez era, painting was not as high as poetry and music. 

00:06:59.880 --> 00:07:06.820
 "Menin" is one of the finest examples of fine art with all the bright effects, 

00:07:06.820 --> 00:07:12.460
 it is a divine inspiration, or the result of accumulated experience throughout life. 

00:07:13.480 --> 00:07:19.040
 All of this goes through the heart of the mirror - from the point of disappearance, multi-centric focus ... 

00:07:19.540 --> 00:07:23.460
 Velasquez tells the audience: "Look, my art is capable of ..." 

00:07:23.460 --> 00:07:28.820
 And to the king and to the rest, he said to them, "Behold, 

00:07:28.820 --> 00:07:33.040
 look at my beautiful look - the most beautiful of yours. " 

00:07:33.600 --> 00:07:37.760
 One of the most remarkable achievements of the Menin era. Impact is infinite. 

00:07:38.640 --> 00:07:45.140
 It is said that IV Philip often came to Velaskes' workshop, 

00:07:45.140 --> 00:07:46.740
 just look at how it works. 

00:07:47.160 --> 00:07:54.740
 In any case, the Men can be able to reflect its meaning after 360 years. 

00:07:55.540 --> 00:08:04.560
 Indeed, while looking at this table at any age, you will gradually be sure that, 

00:08:05.280 --> 00:08:10.940
 you are witnessing one of the most astonishing scenes inherited from medieval works ... 

00:08:16.140 --> 00:08:20.280
 Thank you for viewing :)
