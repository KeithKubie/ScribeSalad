00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:11.700
&gt;&gt; 

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:12.700
MALE: So, first off, could you introduce your
company, give a brief overview of your application

00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:13.700
and your motivations for creating it.
&gt;&gt; MALE: Well, we’re not a company actually,

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:18.910
we are just a project. I started with a friend
of mine about a year ago, part time. So we

00:00:18.910 --> 00:00:22.599
are still seeing it moving it forward. And
we’ve created Storyteller, because today,

00:00:22.599 --> 00:00:27.980
your life on the internet is fragmented across
many different place; pictures from Picasa,

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:32.180
video on YouTube, Google readers. That makes
it difficult for your friends to follow you.

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:38.370
It makes it difficult for you to search and
navigate that information. And more important,

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:41.930
it’s sort of, doesn’t help your online
identity. Your online identity is fragmented

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:45.390
across many different services. So when you
search for your name on Google, there’s

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:49.070
many different place that are showing up and
nothing that really shows who you really are.

00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:53.470
So Storytellers solved that problem by bringing
all your data together in one place, which

00:00:53.470 --> 00:00:58.739
is highly personal typically under the — your
own domain name so you can easily share it

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:03.930
with your friends. And we get our name Storyteller
because we enable people to mesh up, elements

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:09.930
these data together in sort of a story that
serves as a photo album that you can easily

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:13.920
share with your friends or keep as a memory.
So as an example, you’re going to a hike

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:19.329
or holiday, you tweet, post a pictures or
share a video, or you bring that together

00:01:19.329 --> 00:01:23.249
in a nicely packaged, nice visual that we
call a story.

00:01:23.249 --> 00:01:24.249
&gt;&gt; MALE: So, can you tell us a little bit
about how you came about, you know, choosing

00:01:24.249 --> 00:01:33.959
to use these different GD and APIs access
a person’s information? Can you tell us

00:01:33.959 --> 00:01:41.289
of how you came to this decision?
&gt;&gt; MALE: Well, the point of storyteller is

00:01:41.289 --> 00:01:46.020
to bring the users data together. So Google
is the market leader on a lot of these data

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:49.850
source, like, YouTube or Picasa pictures,
for example. So it was just natural to get

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:55.319
the data. And YouTube and Google is very open
on its data source, fantastic APIs that you

00:01:55.319 --> 00:02:01.329
could leverage. So it was natural first step
for us to first target the YouTube data APIs,

00:02:01.329 --> 00:02:04.959
but, of course, we’re adding also, also
services which are not Google properties because

00:02:04.959 --> 00:02:08.689
we really want to be able to cover the whole
range of data source on the internet.

00:02:08.689 --> 00:02:22.830
&gt;&gt; MALE: Okay. So, as developers we really
value being able to share war stories or lessons

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:26.439
from technical challenges. Can you tell us
about one particular difficult period of development

00:02:26.439 --> 00:02:27.439
that you faced and how you approached this
technical challenge?

00:02:27.439 --> 00:02:28.819
&gt;&gt; MALE: I think I would just share with you
my biggest mistake on this project because

00:02:28.819 --> 00:02:33.819
it’s a very good lesson learned. Initially,
we’ve developed this only for our own personal

00:02:33.819 --> 00:02:38.769
page. So we didn’t think about this as a
product, so we didn’t think at all about

00:02:38.769 --> 00:02:44.230
scalability, and we didn’t think at all
about internationalization. So I think for

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:47.000
a developer, if you believe in your product,
and if you believe what you’re building

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:52.390
is great, you should already think about being
huge, being large. I don’t mean you don’t

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:57.470
need to build a scale booth system first hand
but you need to think about it. Because, for

00:02:57.470 --> 00:03:02.159
example, retrofitting a localization framework
in your application, it’s just a nightmare.

00:03:02.159 --> 00:03:07.000
Today, I have to almost rewrite my whole code
base to be able to target different languages.

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:11.790
If I just have taken a few hours to think
through what framework I was going to use

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:16.410
for localization and translation, and to implement
that framework upfront, not to do all the

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:20.370
different languages, just to put the framework
in place, I think today would be okay but

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:24.689
right now we’re totally stuck. The same
thing with scalability, we have to rewrite

00:03:24.689 --> 00:03:29.069
a huge part of our data access because we
didn’t think about simple things that would

00:03:29.069 --> 00:03:33.120
have today save us a lot of time. So, if you
build something and you believe in it, it

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:37.349
is going to be big, think upfront of how you’re
going to make it scale, make it international,

00:03:37.349 --> 00:03:40.250
just think that upfront, it’s going to save
you a lot of time.

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:47.150
&gt;&gt; MALE: So what were the benefits to your
app of using the Google Data APIs?

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:51.430
&gt;&gt; MALE: Well, one thing I find fantastic
in Google Data API is that they are built

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:57.141
on a uniform foundation called the GData protocol.
So it makes it very easy to port codes. So

00:03:57.141 --> 00:04:00.870
if you build codes access to YouTube API,
for example, you can very easily then switch

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:05.341
to Picasa, for example, or the blogger APIs.
It's all built across this GData layer, it's

00:04:05.341 --> 00:04:10.250
all [INDISTINCT] and you have a lot of different
ways to get the data, it would be Atom or

00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:15.519
JSON. I think, honestly, it’s been one of
the simplest API to use amongst different

00:04:15.519 --> 00:04:32.880
services we've targeted.
&gt;&gt; MALE: So this next question is a follow

00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:33.880
up to that. Can you talk about how using Google
Data APIs has reduced the amount of work for

00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:34.880
you? And could you please elaborate on how
this has happened?

00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:37.442
&gt;&gt; MALE: Well, so as I mentioned earlier,
if you write codes to access YouTube and if

00:04:37.442 --> 00:04:42.890
you spent time to learn the YouTube API, all
the knowledge you can translate to any of

00:04:42.890 --> 00:04:47.130
the other Google API, because they are all
using the same foundation. So same thing with

00:04:47.130 --> 00:04:52.080
your code, you can have a common code base
then you will specify for specific data source.

00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:58.530
So that’s where, I think, you don’t have
to develop for each separate, it’s not like,

00:04:58.530 --> 00:05:03.050
you have to spend time on YouTube then spend
time on Picasa. You just spend time on preparing

00:05:03.050 --> 00:05:07.760
a foundation to access Google Data APIs, and
then you sort of get the rest for free. So

00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:13.910
if tomorrow, Google will have a new API for
a new services, like Google reader, I think

00:05:13.910 --> 00:05:19.720
it’s going to be, you know, very easy for
us to get it through. More important, another

00:05:19.720 --> 00:05:23.830
important aspect is that Google support a
lot of different standards in terms of how

00:05:23.830 --> 00:05:30.350
the data is expressed. All our code-base is
PHP, for example, so JSON was a very natural

00:05:30.350 --> 00:05:36.770
fit or a lot of JSON links in PHP that works
quite well. And I think, Google is going to

00:05:36.770 --> 00:05:41.660
introduce even more supports and more of this
kind of data description, so, you know, it's

00:05:41.660 --> 00:05:45.440
all good for us.
&gt;&gt; MALE: So my last question is, what are

00:05:45.440 --> 00:05:50.260
like, three things you’d like to see added
to Google Data APIs?

00:05:50.260 --> 00:05:56.890
&gt;&gt; MALE: In our case, we want data to be as
fast as possible brought into our user’s

00:05:56.890 --> 00:06:01.470
environment so we can display it but also
we can push it, for example, to social networks

00:06:01.470 --> 00:06:06.600
they use. We have a lot of users, so we cannot
ask YouTube every minute, you know, what,

00:06:06.600 --> 00:06:11.350
is there something new. So we want Google
to move forward in helping this real-time

00:06:11.350 --> 00:06:16.740
Web to happen. For example, there is a simple
protocol called SUP, Simple Update Protocol

00:06:16.740 --> 00:06:23.440
which simplifies a lot of this mechanism so
we don’t have to go back to YouTube all

00:06:23.440 --> 00:06:27.360
the time, asking for all our users what’s
new, we just have to go and say, “Hey, what

00:06:27.360 --> 00:06:31.460
happen on YouTube for the last five minutes?”
Maybe somebody there is one of our user, and

00:06:31.460 --> 00:06:36.330
then we can grab his data. So we hope Google
is going to move forward on SUP, not only

00:06:36.330 --> 00:06:41.490
for YouTube but across all its base, that’s
definitely one, one requirement. Two, I would

00:06:41.490 --> 00:06:46.710
love an API on Google Reader. Right now it's
just more of like, just an RSS Feeds. I would

00:06:46.710 --> 00:06:51.080
really like to be able to consume the Google
Reader Data, for example, with SUP, also having

00:06:51.080 --> 00:06:57.680
the tagging, the commands, all included, so
this to be really an API. And number three,

00:06:57.680 --> 00:07:03.800
you know, today was announcement of Wave,
so I just hope that it’s not a request,

00:07:03.800 --> 00:07:08.020
it’s more a wish, I just hope that API is
going to be open enough, so that we can take

00:07:08.020 --> 00:07:12.680
advantage of it but knowing Google, I know
my wish will be exhausted, so I’m looking

00:07:12.680 --> 00:07:16.720
back – I’m looking forward to next year
to show you what we’ll be building with

00:07:16.720 --> 00:07:18.250
Wave.
&gt;&gt; MALE: Awesome.

00:07:18.250 --> 00:07:19.360
&gt;&gt; MALE: Thank you very much.
