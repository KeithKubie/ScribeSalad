I'm Grant Tompson, the King of Random, and
I have accepted the ALS Ice bucket Challenge.

00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:08.799
Except instead of using a bucket of regular
ice, I'm using a bucket filled with dry ice

00:00:08.799 --> 00:00:12.929
which is about five times colder, and minus
109 degrees fahrenheit. I really have no idea

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:16.729
what to expect. So lets just put a little
more dry ice in here and see what happens.

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:24.300
It's pretty heavy.

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:30.680
Whoooo! Yeah!

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:33.760
Taste that carbonation!

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:45.780
Tadaaa!

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:47.700
So there you go, I've successfully completed

00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:50.720
the ice bucket challenge Obviously this is
something you don't wanna duplicate at home.

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:55.230
Because I had a few chunks of dry ice go down
my shirt, and burn my skin. So it is dangerous.

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:59.480
Don't try dry ice. I would like to nominate,
Ben with NightHawkInLight, Bryan Brushwood

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:04.870
from ScamSchool, and Destin from Smarter Everyday.
You have 24 hours to complete this challenge.

00:01:04.870 --> 00:01:05.330
GO!
