FOREIGN POLICY SPEECH FOCUSING

00:00:25.591 --> 00:00:27.126 align:start position:0% line:85%
ON THE MIDDLE EAST.

00:00:27.159 --> 00:00:28.895 align:start position:0% line:85%
SHOULD BE INTERESTING.

00:00:28.928 --> 00:00:30.730 size:81% position:41% line:85%
JEB IS A MAN OF THE WORLD.

00:00:30.763 --> 00:00:38.137 align:start position:0% line:91%
AFTER ALL, IN HALF OF HIS SIGNS,
HE'S KNOWN AS "YEB."

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:40.773 align:start position:0% line:85%
OKAY.

00:00:40.806 --> 00:00:44.243 align:start position:0% line:91%
HIT ME, UNNECESSARY PUNCTUATION
MAN.

00:00:44.276 --> 00:00:47.747 size:88% position:44% line:91%
&gt;&gt; NO LEADER OR POLICY-MAKER
INVOLVED WILL CLAIM TO HAVE

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:51.050 align:start position:0% line:91%
GOTTEN EVERYTHING RIGHT IN THE
REGION, IRAQ ESPECIALLY.

00:00:51.083 --> 00:00:55.621 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; Larry: OH, SNAP!

00:00:55.654 --> 00:01:00.726 line:91%
JEB EXCLAMATION POINT IS ABOUT
TO CALL OUT HIS OWN BROTHER.

00:01:00.759 --> 00:01:04.464 size:84% position:42% line:85%
THIS IS LIKE CAIN AND ABEL!

00:01:04.497 --> 00:01:06.899 align:start position:0% line:91%
WELL, IT'S THE BUSHES, SO IT'S
MORE LIKE THAT TIME NILES

00:01:06.932 --> 00:01:09.836 align:start position:0% line:91%
BETRAYED FRASIER BY REPLACING
HIS CAMEMBERT WITH AN

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:14.874 align:start position:0% line:85%
UNDERWHELMING BRIE.

00:01:14.907 --> 00:01:20.246 align:start position:0% line:91%
(APPLAUSE)
ALL RIGHT, THIS IS EXCITING.

00:01:20.279 --> 00:01:26.018 align:start position:0% line:91%
LET'S SEE HOW BRUTAL HE GETS
TOWARDS OLD W.

00:01:26.051 --> 00:01:27.687 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; YET, IN A LONG EXPERIENCE
THAT INCLUDES FAILURES OF

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:29.455 align:start position:0% line:91%
INTELLIGENCE AND MILITARY
SETBACKS, ONE MOMENT STANDS OUT

00:01:29.488 --> 00:01:31.023 line:91%
IN MEMORY AS THE TURNING POINT
WE HAD ALL BEEN WAITING FOR --

00:01:31.056 --> 00:01:35.061 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; Larry:... YOUR BROTHER
LEAVING OFFICE?

00:01:35.094 --> 00:01:40.666 align:start position:0% line:91%
(AUDIENCE REACTS)
DAMN, JEB, YOU COLD!

00:01:40.699 --> 00:01:44.570 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; -- AND THAT WAS THE SURGE OF
MILITARY AND DIPLOMATIC

00:01:44.603 --> 00:01:49.442 align:start position:0% line:91%
OPERATIONS THAT TURNED EVENTS
TOWARDS VICTORY.

00:01:49.475 --> 00:01:52.011 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; Larry: VICTORY?

00:01:52.044 --> 00:01:55.581 align:start position:0% line:91%
I DON'T, UH, REMEMBER --
&gt;&gt; Larry: REVISIONEST HISTORY

00:01:55.614 --> 00:01:56.616 align:start position:0% line:85%
ALERT.

00:01:56.649 --> 00:01:57.984 size:84% position:42% line:85%
HISTORY HAS BEEN REWRITTEN.

00:01:58.017 --> 00:02:01.320 align:start position:0% line:85%
HUH-OH, GUYS.

00:02:01.353 --> 00:02:03.356 align:start position:0% line:91%
WE'RE IN DANGER OF HISTORY BEING
REVISED.

00:02:03.389 --> 00:02:06.726 align:start position:0% line:91%
THAT'S OUR REVISIONIST HISTORY
ALERT.

00:02:06.759 --> 00:02:07.527 align:start position:0% line:85%
WHAT ARE WE IN FOR?

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:09.428 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; IT WAS A SUCCESS.

00:02:09.461 --> 00:02:16.002 line:91%
SO WHY WAS THE SUCCESS OF THE
SURGE FOLLOWED BY A WITHDRAWAL

00:02:16.035 --> 00:02:17.803 line:91%
FROM IRAQ, CREATING THE VOID
THAT I.S.I.S. MOVED IN TO FILL?

00:02:17.836 --> 00:02:19.438 align:start position:0% line:91%
WHERE WAS SECRETARY OF STATE
CLINTON IN ALL OF THIS?

00:02:19.471 --> 00:02:21.440 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; Larry: WHOA, WHOA, WHOA,
WHOA!

00:02:21.473 --> 00:02:26.212 align:start position:0% line:91%
SO GEORGE IS GONE, AND IT'S ALL
HILLARY'S PROBLEM NOW?

00:02:26.245 --> 00:02:29.916 align:start position:0% line:91%
WHAT KIND OF DISTORTED REALITY
ARE YOU LIVING IN?

00:02:29.949 --> 00:02:31.617 size:88% position:44% line:91%
THIS IS SOME DOC BROWN MARTY
McFLY TIME TRAVEL REALNESS

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:32.484 align:start position:0% line:85%
RIGHT NOW.

00:02:32.518 --> 00:02:39.192 align:start position:0% line:91%
"WHERE WE'RE GOING, WE DON'T
NEED FACTS!"

00:02:39.225 --> 00:02:42.228 align:start position:0% line:91%
(APPLAUSE)
&gt;&gt; LIKE THE PRESIDENT HIMSELF,

00:02:42.261 --> 00:02:44.130 line:91%
SHE HAD OPPOSED THE SURGE, THEN
JOINED IN CLAIMING CREDIT FOR

00:02:44.163 --> 00:02:46.365 align:start position:0% line:85%
ITS SUCCESS.

00:02:46.398 --> 00:02:48.434 size:88% position:44% line:91%
WHO CAN SERIOUSLY ARGUE THAT
AMERICA AND OUR FRIENDS ARE

00:02:48.467 --> 00:02:50.503 size:78% position:39% line:85%
SAFER TODAY THAN IN 2009?

00:02:50.536 --> 00:02:53.506 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; Larry: OH, YOU WANT TO PLAY
THE "SAFER THAN" GAME?

00:02:53.539 --> 00:02:55.741 align:start position:0% line:91%
YOU WANT THE PLAY THE "SAFER
THAN" GAME?

00:02:55.774 --> 00:02:58.144 line:91%
BECAUSE I THINK MOST AMERICANS
FELT A LOT SAFER IN THE CLINTON

00:02:58.177 --> 00:03:01.814 align:start position:0% line:91%
ADMINISTRATION THAN THE BUSH
ADMINISTRATION.

00:03:01.847 --> 00:03:03.216 align:start position:0% line:85%
2009?

00:03:03.249 --> 00:03:04.984 align:start position:0% line:91%
IF YOU'RE GOING TO DROP A
DATE -- I'VE GOT SEPTEMBER 11

00:03:05.017 --> 00:03:06.886 size:75% position:38% line:85%
RIGHT HERE IN MY POCKET.

00:03:06.919 --> 00:03:08.588 size:88% position:44% line:85%
YOU WANT ME TO TAKE IT OUT?!

00:03:08.621 --> 00:03:11.090 align:start position:0% line:85%
DIDN'T THINK SO.

00:03:11.123 --> 00:03:12.692 align:start position:0% line:91%
YOU WERE SAYING ABOUT THE
WITHDRAWAL FROM IRAQ,

00:03:12.725 --> 00:03:15.394 align:start position:0% line:85%
MR. EXCLAMATION POINT?

00:03:15.427 --> 00:03:19.198 line:91%
&gt;&gt; IT WAS A CASE OF BLIND HASTE
TO GET OUT AND CALL THE TRAGIC

00:03:19.231 --> 00:03:22.134 align:start position:0% line:91%
CONSEQUENCES SOMEBODY ELSE'S
PROBLEM.

00:03:22.167 --> 00:03:24.704 line:91%
RUSHING AWAY FROM DANGER CAN BE
EVERY BIT AS UNWISE AS RUSHING

00:03:24.737 --> 00:03:26.839 align:start position:0% line:85%
INTO DANGER.

00:03:26.872 --> 00:03:32.712 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; Larry: NO, IT CAN'T!

00:03:32.745 --> 00:03:36.048 align:start position:0% line:85%
THAT'S NOT A THING!

00:03:36.081 --> 00:03:38.884 line:91%
YOU DON'T RUN INTO A HOUSE FIRE
AND THEN TAKE YOUR TIME GETTING

00:03:38.917 --> 00:03:42.455 align:start position:0% line:85%
OUT.

00:03:42.488 --> 00:03:44.123 align:start position:0% line:91%
YOU DO THE THING YOU WENT IN
THERE TO DO -- SAVE YOUR

00:03:44.156 --> 00:03:50.363 align:start position:0% line:91%
COLLECTION OF VINTAGE
PORNOGRAPHY -- AND YOU GET OUT!

00:03:50.396 --> 00:03:52.331 align:start position:0% line:85%
EVERYBODY KNOWS THAT.

00:03:52.364 --> 00:03:56.135 line:91%
SO THEN YESTERDAY, WHEN JEB WAS
ASKED ABOUT HIS IRAQ ATTACK ON

00:03:56.168 --> 00:04:01.407 align:start position:0% line:91%
THE DEMOCRATIC CANDIDATE, HE
SAID THIS --

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:07.713 line:91%
"I'M NOT ATTACKING HER," BUSH
"I'M JUST POINTING OUT THAT THE

00:04:07.746 --> 00:04:09.415 align:start position:0% line:91%
FOREIGN POLICY THAT THEY HAVE
IMPLEMENTED WAS ONE THAT CREATED

00:04:09.448 --> 00:04:16.956 size:75% position:38% line:85%
A MORE DANGEROUS WORLD."

00:04:16.989 --> 00:04:17.957 align:start position:0% line:91%
YEAH,
 "I'M NOT ATTACKING HER, I'M

00:04:17.990 --> 00:04:19.258 align:start position:0% line:91%
HUGGING THE FACT THAT SHE'S
RESPONSIBLE FOR ALL 

00:04:19.291 --> 00:04:21.861 line:85%
THE EVIL IN THE WORLD."

00:04:21.894 --> 00:04:23.429 line:91%
THIS IS UNBELIEVABLE TO ME, THAT
JEB -- EXCLAMATION (BLEEP) POINT

00:04:23.462 --> 00:04:26.365 line:91%
BUSH -- ACTUALLY HAD THE GALL TO
MAKE IT SEEM LIKE THIS (BLEEP)

00:04:26.398 --> 00:04:31.737 align:start position:0% line:91%
IN THE MIDDLE EAST WAS NOT
STARTED BY HIS BROTHER.

00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:33.739 line:91%
AND FOR THE RECORD, JEB EVEN
ADMITS HE WOULD HAVE DONE IT,

00:04:33.772 --> 00:04:36.509 align:start position:0% line:85%
TOO.

00:04:36.542 --> 00:04:39.211 line:91%
&gt;&gt; ON THE SUBJECT OF IRAQ,
OBVIOUSLY VERY CONTROVERSIAL,

00:04:39.244 --> 00:04:40.546 align:start position:0% line:91%
KNOWING WHAT WE KNOW NOW, WOULD
YOU HAVE AUTHORIZED THE

00:04:40.579 --> 00:04:42.715 align:start position:0% line:85%
INVASION?

00:04:42.748 --> 00:04:44.550 line:91%
&gt;&gt; I WOULD HAVE, AND SO WOULD
HAVE HILLARY CLINTON, JUST TO

00:04:44.583 --> 00:04:45.685 align:start position:0% line:85%
REMIND EVERYBODY.

00:04:45.718 --> 00:04:48.254 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; Larry: NO, NO, NO.

00:04:48.287 --> 00:04:50.356 align:start position:0% line:91%
STOP TRYING TO DRAG HILLARY INTO
THIS.

00:04:50.389 --> 00:04:52.124 align:start position:0% line:85%
THAT'S HORRIBLE.

00:04:52.157 --> 00:05:02.101 line:91%
BASICALLY, YOUR BROTHER TOOK A
BIG STINKING DUMP, DIDN'T FLUSH,

00:05:02.134 --> 00:05:04.437 align:start position:0% line:91%
(APPLAUSE)
RIGHT?

00:05:04.470 --> 00:05:06.539 align:start position:0% line:85%
THAT'S WHAT IT'S LIKE!

00:05:06.572 --> 00:05:08.374 align:start position:0% line:91%
HATE TO BE GRAPHIC, LADIES, I
APOLOGIZE --

00:05:08.407 --> 00:05:13.913 line:91%
BROKE THE TOILET, YOU ADMIT YOU
WOULD HAVE DONE THE SAME -- AND

00:05:13.946 --> 00:05:15.948 line:91%
NOW YOU'RE TRYING TO BLAME IT ON
THE NICE LADY WHO'S DELETING HER

00:05:15.981 --> 00:05:17.850 align:start position:0% line:85%
E-MAILS DOWN THE HALL.

00:05:17.883 --> 00:05:19.285 align:start position:0% line:85%
THAT'S NOT RIGHT.

00:05:19.318 --> 00:05:20.451 align:start position:0% line:85%
THAT'S NOT RIGHT!
