00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:18.100
Whenever people hear the title "Alice in Wonderland," usually the first thing they think of is the Disney version.

00:00:18.100 --> 00:00:21.080
And...yeah, actually, that's not such a bad version to think of.

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:25.540
The story about a young girl who finds herself trapped in a very strange, mysterious land

00:00:25.540 --> 00:00:28.540
is much more based on the journey than finding twists or turns.

00:00:28.540 --> 00:00:30.740
The character of Alice is a bit of a blank slate.

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:35.120
She's the normal person that's supposed to play off all the weird, strange things that she comes across.

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:41.420
It plays very much like a road trip movie--you come across something strange, you have an encounter with it, and then you move on to the next strange thing.

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:45.500
Like I said, the focus is not the twists and turns, but all the oddities that she comes across.

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:49.660
It's like "Dante's Inferno;" it's more a study of what you're seeing than what you're experiencing.

00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:53.700
But with that said, the girl that got to play Alice is actually pretty good.

00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:59.160
Her name's Kathryn Beaumont, and she does a really good job actually giving some character to this person.

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:03.860
The dialogue from "Alice in Wonderland" is not easy to recite, and it's not easy to make casual.

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:05.780
But she does a pretty good job.

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:09.740
She's curious, she's polite, she's nice, but can be pushed to her limits.

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:13.020
She tries to join in the fun, but often finds herself too frustrated.

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:14.760
And she's also very logical.

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:19.020
Which makes a lot of sense in a story like this, because this is a world where logic almost has no place.

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:20.480
-"He went that way."

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:21.860
-"Who did?"
-"The White Rabbit."

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:23.220
-"He did?"
-"He did what?"

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:24.960
-"Went that way."
-"Who did?"

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:26.660
-"The White Rabbit!"
-"What rabbit?"

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:30.580
-"[slightly out of breath] But didn't you just say--I mean--oh, dear!"

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:33.220
-"Can you stand on your head?"
-[huffs]

00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:35.380
-My favorite characters are your favorite characters.

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:38.800
I love the Mad Hatter, I love the March Hare, I love the Cheshire Cat.

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:40.660
They're all absolutely crazy.

00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:44.680
But at the same time, I think the fun with them is that you never know if they're threatening or not.

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:50.640
Their mood swings are just so fast, and you never know if something really dangerous is gonna happen, or if they're just playing along.

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:53.080
Half the time, I don't even think THEY know.

00:01:53.080 --> 00:02:06.440
-[chuckles, laughs, then gasps] "You may have noticed that I'm not all there myself." [chuckles, then laughing fades]

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:09.220
-The Queen is one of my favorite funny villains.

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:13.760
Actually, watching her again, I realize I actually did take a lot of the Nostalgia Critic from this character.

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:18.080
Just how quickly she can turn from calm and collected to just screaming like a little child.

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:20.500
-[Queen yelling]

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:26.040
-I really do love pathetic, whiny brats in a grown-up body, but somehow have a ton of power.

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:33.200
And I love watching Alice trying to figure out what's the right thing to say and right thing to do because she knows that any second, her head could be gone.

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:35.840
And actually, that's a pretty dark aspect to the story, isn't it?

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:39.020
How many characters do actually get their heads chopped off in this movie?

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:41.400
Just because they don't show it doesn't mean it isn't happening.

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:43.220
It's pretty grim.

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:45.960
Wonderland itself is very different from other interpretations.

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:49.200
It doesn't have a bright, colorful background; it's very black.

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:50.880
Most of the backgrounds are black.

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:56.640
But that's always great, because when color DOES come in, it's always bright, it's always clashing, and it always pops.

00:02:56.640 --> 00:03:02.140
Some people have problems that they cut out too much from the original books, and, well, it's a Disney film.

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:03.760
And an animated one at that.

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:05.460
You sort of have to get whatever you're given.

00:03:05.460 --> 00:03:10.500
I will say, with all the forced Disney sequels out there, how come this never got one?

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:13.780
There is literally a sequel book to "Alice in Wonderland."

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:17.600
Why didn't they just change things around a bit and start putting in some of the other characters?

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:21.460
Like the Knight, the Turtle, the Griffin--there's a ton of areas you could go with this.

00:03:21.460 --> 00:03:22.180
But oh well.

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:27.240
What I do like about "Alice in Wonderland" is that it does make the transition into movie form.

00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:32.700
That's the trap I think a lot of other movie versions fall into, is that they try to follow the book a little too closely.

00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:37.360
Ironically, with the Tim Burton one, I don't think they followed it enough, but I've complained about that enough before.

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:41.940
"Alice in Wonderland" is creative, it looks great, it's a wonderful journey movie,

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:45.340
and the majority of it works because the main character is just so likable.

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:49.020
I have very few complaints about it, except honestly,  I would have liked to have seen more.

00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:50.920
But I guess that's a good complaint to have.

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:56.580
If you're looking for a movie that's big on story, surprises, and character development, this is probably not the place to look.

00:03:56.580 --> 00:04:00.140
But I think most people going into "Alice in Wonderland" know what they're gonna get.

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:03.620
And in my opinion, this is one of the better versions.

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:08.900
