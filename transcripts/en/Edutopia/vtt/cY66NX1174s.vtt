00:00:08.806 --> 00:00:10.396
&gt;&gt;Right now we're in the
middle of our DNA unit.

00:00:10.976 --> 00:00:12.246
We can get you caught
up but I need you

00:00:12.246 --> 00:00:14.686
in class every single day,
no ifs, ands, or buts.

00:00:14.806 --> 00:00:16.866
Actions speak louder words.

00:00:17.046 --> 00:00:18.566
&gt;&gt;Sarah Revis is in trouble.

00:00:19.036 --> 00:00:22.836
She's failing several classes because
she hasn't been to school in a month.

00:00:22.836 --> 00:00:25.196
&gt;&gt;I do think that you're one
of the most capable students.

00:00:25.826 --> 00:00:27.956
&gt;&gt;If she were part of
the general population

00:00:27.956 --> 00:00:31.726
at Andrew Hill High School, her
teachers might simply write her off.

00:00:32.566 --> 00:00:36.856
But she's a member of the school's
Biotech Academy, a close-knit family

00:00:36.856 --> 00:00:39.636
of at-risk students
and dedicated teachers

00:00:39.636 --> 00:00:41.876
for whom failure is not an option.

00:00:41.876 --> 00:00:43.186
&gt;&gt;This has got to change.

00:00:43.296 --> 00:00:44.136
Do I need to call mom?

00:00:44.376 --> 00:00:45.526
Honestly, if you want me to call mom.

00:00:45.526 --> 00:00:45.703
&gt;&gt;No.

00:00:45.703 --> 00:00:46.576
&gt;&gt;Then I won't okay?

00:00:46.846 --> 00:00:47.746
Is this going to change?

00:00:47.746 --> 00:00:48.666
&gt;&gt;Yes.

00:00:48.666 --> 00:00:49.636
&gt;&gt;Okay when?

00:00:49.636 --> 00:00:53.826
&gt;&gt;Today.

00:00:53.826 --> 00:00:54.386
&gt;&gt;And if not?

00:00:55.206 --> 00:00:56.816
&gt;&gt;Then I'll be out of Biotech.

00:00:56.816 --> 00:00:56.916
&gt;&gt;So?

00:00:56.916 --> 00:00:59.846
&gt;&gt;I want to go to college and
I probably won't graduate.

00:00:59.846 --> 00:00:59.913
&gt;&gt;So?

00:00:59.913 --> 00:01:01.506
&gt;&gt;And that matters to me.

00:01:01.746 --> 00:01:05.616
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Graduating from Biotech
has changed the lives of hundreds

00:01:05.616 --> 00:01:07.786
of students since the
academy was founded

00:01:07.786 --> 00:01:11.976
on Andrew Hill High School's
San Jose campus in 1999.

00:01:12.096 --> 00:01:13.616
&gt;&gt;Okay remember how it works.

00:01:13.616 --> 00:01:16.476
The [inaudible] if it's going left or
right is closed, up and down is open.

00:01:17.006 --> 00:01:19.686
&gt;&gt;Biotech Academy is
sort of the cornerstone

00:01:19.686 --> 00:01:21.166
of the school, our trademark.

00:01:21.466 --> 00:01:22.086
&gt;&gt;Forty-five.

00:01:22.086 --> 00:01:24.156
Forty-five minus.

00:01:24.336 --> 00:01:27.886
&gt;&gt;We wanted to provide opportunities
for students who were, you know,

00:01:27.886 --> 00:01:32.316
in that category of maybe marginal
or at-risk because our concept was

00:01:32.316 --> 00:01:36.386
if you have a program that these
students can be connected to,

00:01:36.516 --> 00:01:39.346
that's going to increase the
probability that they're going

00:01:39.346 --> 00:01:42.466
to stay in school and
matriculate to either a two-year

00:01:42.466 --> 00:01:44.126
or four-year college university.

00:01:44.916 --> 00:01:48.676
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Each fall 50 sophomores
enter the three-year academy program

00:01:48.976 --> 00:01:52.446
which features an interdisciplinary
curriculum focused on bioscience.

00:01:53.346 --> 00:01:57.236
Juniors are hooked up with mentors
at local biotechnology companies

00:01:57.566 --> 00:02:01.576
and as seniors they present the
results of self-designed experiments.

00:02:02.076 --> 00:02:04.726
&gt;&gt;Our first lab was
actually getting the rats

00:02:05.206 --> 00:02:06.986
and putting them in the tanks.

00:02:06.986 --> 00:02:10.326
&gt;&gt;While only 30 percent of the
school's general population goes

00:02:10.326 --> 00:02:15.566
on to college, the rate for Biotech
Academy students is 95 percent.

00:02:15.896 --> 00:02:17.206
&gt;&gt;Can you see that?

00:02:17.206 --> 00:02:17.416
&gt;&gt;No.

00:02:17.416 --> 00:02:20.226
&gt;&gt;Can you see the paper
in front of you?

00:02:20.226 --> 00:02:21.626
&gt;&gt;Yes.

00:02:21.626 --> 00:02:21.716
&gt;&gt;Good.

00:02:21.846 --> 00:02:24.246
&gt;&gt;Much of the credit for
the academy's success goes

00:02:24.276 --> 00:02:25.916
to a unique team of teachers.

00:02:26.266 --> 00:02:28.646
&gt;&gt;Imperialism in Africa.

00:02:28.646 --> 00:02:31.066
&gt;&gt;The teachers in this
program were hand-picked.

00:02:32.016 --> 00:02:37.396
Criteria was first that they
were high-energy communicators

00:02:37.916 --> 00:02:40.516
that understood how to reach kids.

00:02:40.726 --> 00:02:44.456
&gt;&gt;The English come down and
they're like "Move over"

00:02:44.456 --> 00:02:45.666
to the Dutch, "move over, move over."

00:02:45.666 --> 00:02:47.816
And the Dutch are like, go ahead,

00:02:47.816 --> 00:02:50.336
the Dutch are like
"Move back, move back."

00:02:50.336 --> 00:02:52.296
And so they're going
to end up doing what?

00:02:52.326 --> 00:02:53.616
What are the English and
the Dutch going to be doing?

00:02:53.646 --> 00:02:53.796
&gt;&gt;Student: Fighting.

00:02:53.826 --> 00:02:53.976
&gt;&gt;Christine: Fighting.

00:02:54.106 --> 00:02:58.966
&gt;&gt;The relationship that we have with
these kids is completely unique.

00:02:58.966 --> 00:03:00.956
The way we speak, the
"What are you doing?

00:03:01.016 --> 00:03:01.656
Where are you going?

00:03:01.656 --> 00:03:03.016
Why aren't you supposed
to be in class?

00:03:03.016 --> 00:03:03.976
Let me see your grades?

00:03:03.976 --> 00:03:04.466
What- what are you doing?"

00:03:04.466 --> 00:03:07.266
They respond; for some
reason it works for them.

00:03:07.576 --> 00:03:10.806
&gt;&gt;Matt: Okay so this is
what we're going to do.

00:03:10.986 --> 00:03:15.876
We have to figure out what is the
concentration of an unknown acid.

00:03:15.876 --> 00:03:16.156
Okay?

00:03:16.856 --> 00:03:21.696
&gt;&gt;It's kind of hard because basically
you have such a wide range from kid

00:03:21.796 --> 00:03:24.496
that are extremely intelligent
but just aren't trying to kids

00:03:24.496 --> 00:03:26.206
that need a lot of hand-holding.

00:03:26.206 --> 00:03:29.916
&gt;&gt;The last class still was
confused so we'll try it again.

00:03:29.916 --> 00:03:31.116
Unknown acid, okay.

00:03:31.786 --> 00:03:35.936
&gt;&gt;Coming from the suburbs of Chicago
I did not grow up the same way

00:03:35.936 --> 00:03:38.326
as these kids are growing
up so it's very difficult

00:03:38.326 --> 00:03:40.466
for me to relate lots of times.

00:03:40.466 --> 00:03:41.676
Like there was a time last year

00:03:41.676 --> 00:03:43.376
where a kid came in,
didn't do his homework.

00:03:43.506 --> 00:03:44.866
"Why didn't you do your homework?"

00:03:45.016 --> 00:03:46.026
"My family got evicted.

00:03:46.026 --> 00:03:46.946
We had to move to a car.

00:03:46.946 --> 00:03:47.626
We're living in a car."

00:03:47.866 --> 00:03:49.766
So you're like "Hand it in later."

00:03:49.766 --> 00:03:51.316
It's like what are you going to say?

00:03:51.316 --> 00:03:53.696
You can't be angry at the student,

00:03:53.696 --> 00:03:55.126
the child because it's
not their fault.

00:03:55.806 --> 00:03:59.266
&gt;&gt;Doug: McCarthy is a senator
so that's the Senate Hearings.

00:03:59.266 --> 00:04:02.106
What's the other part of our
government- or the congress?

00:04:02.506 --> 00:04:07.086
&gt;&gt;My role is more I think in some
respects the guns, the enforcer.

00:04:07.176 --> 00:04:09.766
I get to get in people's
faces, I get to yell.

00:04:10.136 --> 00:04:12.876
I chase them down.

00:04:12.876 --> 00:04:15.636
I'm checking on attendance
if they're cutting a class,

00:04:16.466 --> 00:04:17.896
I'm going to find them.

00:04:17.896 --> 00:04:20.856
&gt;&gt;I have high expectations of
their behavior, of your schoolwork

00:04:21.096 --> 00:04:23.256
and I'm going to do what it takes.

00:04:23.416 --> 00:04:24.436
&gt;&gt;These people really care.

00:04:24.436 --> 00:04:26.576
These teachers, you know,
they'll help you a lot.

00:04:26.706 --> 00:04:28.386
They never let your grades go down.

00:04:28.696 --> 00:04:30.726
If your grades go down
you get disciplined.

00:04:30.726 --> 00:04:34.966
I've had teachers chase me
because I try to cut class.

00:04:34.966 --> 00:04:36.656
Mr. Schaefer, my U.S.
History teacher,

00:04:36.656 --> 00:04:38.756
he's jumped a fence just to get me.

00:04:39.406 --> 00:04:42.116
&gt;&gt;Peace, love and granola.

00:04:42.316 --> 00:04:47.456
Adieu, adieu, adieu to
you and you and you!

00:04:48.916 --> 00:04:52.726
&gt;&gt;Just let me say that I
saw Ms. Fields last week.

00:04:53.346 --> 00:04:56.806
She had come in because
Keith had a C.

00:04:57.176 --> 00:04:58.776
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Since Biotech
teachers meet

00:04:58.776 --> 00:05:02.836
for lunch nearly every day they can
share impressions of their students

00:05:03.036 --> 00:05:06.086
and intervene early when they
see trouble on the horizon.

00:05:06.916 --> 00:05:07.966
&gt;&gt;Sorry that we're here.

00:05:08.276 --> 00:05:10.496
Keith is such a great
kid and he's smart

00:05:10.496 --> 00:05:12.466
but he's just not using
what he's got.

00:05:13.256 --> 00:05:14.686
&gt;&gt;You got support from home.

00:05:14.936 --> 00:05:18.186
You've got the ability, you've
got the support in this academy.

00:05:18.486 --> 00:05:21.926
There's no reason why you
shouldn't be getting As or Bs.

00:05:22.086 --> 00:05:27.806
&gt;&gt;I noticed my mom was mad at
me and she kind of explained

00:05:27.806 --> 00:05:32.856
that when we got home and after
that kind of clicked something

00:05:33.056 --> 00:05:36.736
and I brought my grades up.

00:05:36.736 --> 00:05:41.416
&gt;&gt;Keith is a very good example of
how you can really turn a student

00:05:41.416 --> 00:05:43.426
around by just paying
attention to them.

00:05:43.806 --> 00:05:46.376
&gt;&gt;This is allele Y.
This is allele X or one

00:05:46.376 --> 00:05:47.606
and two as we talked about them.

00:05:48.276 --> 00:05:50.356
&gt;&gt;Biotech students
get additional support

00:05:50.356 --> 00:05:53.476
and attention outside the
classroom from mentors

00:05:53.476 --> 00:05:56.196
at several biotech
companies in Silicon Valley.

00:05:57.076 --> 00:05:58.696
&gt;&gt;So we got an unexpected result

00:05:58.696 --> 00:06:00.176
so this is what happens
when you do science.

00:06:00.256 --> 00:06:01.976
Things happen that
you don't understand.

00:06:02.246 --> 00:06:04.836
You have a hypothesis, something
that we think is going to happen.

00:06:05.266 --> 00:06:08.706
We do the experiment to see what
actually happens and then you try

00:06:08.706 --> 00:06:11.256
to understand it to go back
and change your hypothesis.

00:06:11.656 --> 00:06:13.716
&gt;&gt;A lot of these students
are of Latino background

00:06:13.716 --> 00:06:17.506
so I think it helps them to see
someone who comes from their culture

00:06:17.506 --> 00:06:21.596
as well who has been able to
progress in this particular career

00:06:21.596 --> 00:06:24.756
so I think it makes it something
that's more of an option for them.

00:06:24.816 --> 00:06:26.846
&gt;&gt;Take ten microliters
from the small tube.

00:06:27.386 --> 00:06:31.386
&gt;&gt;As a freshman I just thought I was
going to be a single mother at my age

00:06:31.386 --> 00:06:34.666
at 16 or just be nothing.

00:06:34.996 --> 00:06:36.906
&gt;&gt;Narrator: For Erica
Diaz the decision

00:06:36.906 --> 00:06:39.006
to enter Biotech changed her life.

00:06:39.586 --> 00:06:43.096
&gt;&gt;Erika: As a sophomore I said
I want to become a doctor,

00:06:44.106 --> 00:06:46.156
but to become a doctor
what do you have to do?

00:06:46.156 --> 00:06:51.916
You have to go to school and I guess
that's- that goal started reaching

00:06:51.916 --> 00:06:53.976
out like started getting
bigger for me.

00:06:54.426 --> 00:06:59.056
&gt;&gt;And every day is like a goal for
me to be in class, to be in school

00:06:59.526 --> 00:07:00.916
so I can reach that goal.

00:07:01.166 --> 00:07:06.036
&gt;&gt;We had them in the light first
and then we covered the tank

00:07:06.036 --> 00:07:09.796
with like black paper so it could
look dark in there and then that's

00:07:09.796 --> 00:07:12.996
when they were more sexually active.

00:07:12.996 --> 00:07:15.996
&gt;&gt;As the semester drew to a
close, students came together

00:07:15.996 --> 00:07:17.946
to assist each other
with preparations

00:07:17.946 --> 00:07:19.376
for their final presentation.

00:07:20.056 --> 00:07:23.296
&gt;&gt;I think one thing in honors class
if you often see is real competition.

00:07:23.756 --> 00:07:25.026
I'm working for that A+.

00:07:25.026 --> 00:07:27.976
I got to-- whereas here I think
we've seen more cooperation.

00:07:28.056 --> 00:07:29.846
The students realize hey
we're in this together.

00:07:30.076 --> 00:07:33.036
And doing group work projects,
we got to do this together.

00:07:33.576 --> 00:07:35.036
I think that's a big advantage.

00:07:35.086 --> 00:07:38.156
&gt;&gt;The intimacy of this
school within a school

00:07:38.156 --> 00:07:42.496
and the group collaboration helped
Berenis Revuelta overcome her shyness

00:07:42.496 --> 00:07:43.956
to become a top student.

00:07:44.286 --> 00:07:45.956
&gt;&gt;We just wanted to
find out the easiest way

00:07:45.956 --> 00:07:47.796
to take DNA from a tarantula.

00:07:47.796 --> 00:07:50.016
&gt;&gt;I was like antisocial.

00:07:50.156 --> 00:07:52.316
Didn't really get along
with many people.

00:07:52.696 --> 00:07:57.396
But having all these kids
in the same like for three

00:07:57.396 --> 00:08:01.196
or more classes you kind
of get attached to them.

00:08:01.516 --> 00:08:02.976
&gt;&gt;After a summer internship

00:08:02.976 --> 00:08:05.956
at Genentech she plans
to enter Chico State.

00:08:06.176 --> 00:08:07.036
&gt;&gt;We wanted to see

00:08:07.116 --> 00:08:12.446
if over-the-counter steroids had the
same effect as prescribed steroids.

00:08:12.446 --> 00:08:15.796
&gt;&gt;Most of my family doesn't end
up like in college and stuff

00:08:15.856 --> 00:08:19.096
and all they know is like
Medical Assistants or something,

00:08:19.616 --> 00:08:23.776
and so me becoming like a biochemist
or something it will be like, wow,

00:08:24.016 --> 00:08:25.106
you're really doing something.

00:08:26.156 --> 00:08:28.876
&gt;&gt;Students: Whoo!

00:08:29.306 --> 00:08:31.686
&gt;&gt;These are the kind of folks that
have a commitment who are willing

00:08:31.686 --> 00:08:37.106
to put their time, their effort,
their hearts out to students

00:08:37.106 --> 00:08:41.146
because they understand that
these students will return

00:08:41.146 --> 00:08:42.716
that same sort of commitment to them.

00:08:43.246 --> 00:08:47.066
&gt;&gt;And these guys had a
difficult time coming to school.

00:08:47.066 --> 00:08:48.616
They had a difficult
time telling the truth.

00:08:48.996 --> 00:08:53.166
They had a difficult time
keeping focused and I'm so proud

00:08:53.386 --> 00:08:57.946
and I don't want to
cry right now but--

00:08:57.946 --> 00:08:58.126
&gt;&gt;Student: Griffin!

00:08:58.196 --> 00:09:01.316
