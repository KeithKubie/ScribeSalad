ANI LIU: I like to
challenge my audience

00:00:02.934 --> 00:00:06.333
with sensory experiences that
can almost feel threatening.

00:00:06.333 --> 00:00:07.667
[dramatic electronic music]

00:00:07.667 --> 00:00:11.433
I always use hair,
spit, semen, blood.

00:00:11.433 --> 00:00:13.333
Why do you find it disgusting?

00:00:13.333 --> 00:00:14.333
Why is that normal?

00:00:14.333 --> 00:00:15.767
Why are things so sanitized?

00:00:19.266 --> 00:00:23.500
I think as an artist I'm
really interested in all things

00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:26.834
sensory, especially as
it relates to perception.

00:00:26.834 --> 00:00:30.734
And with things like virtual
reality and augmented reality,

00:00:30.734 --> 00:00:32.900
it's so interesting
that you can kind

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:35.533
of reprogram that perception.

00:00:35.533 --> 00:00:39.500
So the empathy machines are a
set of headsets that allowed

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:41.266
two people to swap vision.

00:00:41.266 --> 00:00:44.333
They're equipped with
tiny cameras that they use

00:00:44.333 --> 00:00:46.700
for drones, actually,
and video glasses,

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:50.633
and they're programmed with
radio frequency to swap feeds.

00:00:50.633 --> 00:00:52.633
So you could look
out through my eyes

00:00:52.633 --> 00:00:53.867
and I would look
out through yours.

00:00:57.033 --> 00:01:00.500
When you look at something,
light bounces off that object

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:02.333
and reflects into
your retina and it

00:01:02.333 --> 00:01:03.900
becomes-- processes the image.

00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:07.066
But when you smell something,
a molecule of that substance

00:01:07.066 --> 00:01:11.667
binds into your receptor and, in
my mind, becomes a part of you.

00:01:11.667 --> 00:01:15.133
The project Human Perfume
started very ambitiously

00:01:15.133 --> 00:01:17.533
with the goal of
growing a plant that

00:01:17.533 --> 00:01:21.033
could always create the
scent profile of someone that

00:01:21.033 --> 00:01:22.500
had loved and lost.

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:24.867
And it turns out it was a
very complicated process.

00:01:24.867 --> 00:01:27.934
But along the way, I learned
a lot of other techniques

00:01:27.934 --> 00:01:32.033
which allowed me to create
a chemical reamalgamation

00:01:32.033 --> 00:01:34.100
of someone's smell.

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:37.333
First, I take someone's
shirt or garment

00:01:37.333 --> 00:01:39.500
that they've been wearing
for a really long time

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:43.967
and then I cut strips of
it that are the stinkiest

00:01:43.967 --> 00:01:46.333
and I put them in a solvent.

00:01:46.333 --> 00:01:50.166
And then I distill it from
very traditional ways,

00:01:50.166 --> 00:01:51.600
like with glassware.

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:56.166
There's something so
inherently sensual about smell.

00:01:56.166 --> 00:01:58.333
I think in the current
landscape that we're in,

00:01:58.333 --> 00:01:59.967
it's really important
to come back

00:01:59.967 --> 00:02:02.100
to these sensual experiences.

00:02:05.667 --> 00:02:08.300
I really love revealing
the invisible, actually,

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:12.300
everything from the microscopic
scale to the, I guess,

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:14.767
telescopic scale.

00:02:14.767 --> 00:02:18.767
With the microbial pieces that
are self-portraits that I grew

00:02:18.767 --> 00:02:22.433
from my body, I was really
interested in forces

00:02:22.433 --> 00:02:25.266
that co-make me beyond myself.

00:02:25.266 --> 00:02:27.900
I was talking to
a microbiologist

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:31.000
and he was telling me about the
microbiome for the first time

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:32.600
and I was so blown away.

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:36.000
For every 10 cells in your body,
nine of them are not your own.

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.433
They're invisible,
but basically live

00:02:38.433 --> 00:02:41.734
on every surface of your
body and influence everything

00:02:41.734 --> 00:02:46.700
from your behavior to your mood
and it's such an integral part

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:48.300
of who you are.

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:50.867
I started to grow
my own cultures

00:02:50.867 --> 00:02:52.567
just to see what they were.

00:02:52.567 --> 00:02:54.400
What do they look
like from my armpit?

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:55.734
What do they smell like?

00:02:55.734 --> 00:02:57.200
What do they look like
from my belly button?

00:02:57.200 --> 00:03:00.433
What does it look
like from my partner?

00:03:00.433 --> 00:03:03.467
You use agar,
which is a gelatin,

00:03:03.467 --> 00:03:07.033
and put in a bunch of nutrients
and you set into a jelly

00:03:07.033 --> 00:03:08.600
into a Petri dish.

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:12.667
I would dip a sterile Q-tip
in DI water and then plate it.

00:03:12.667 --> 00:03:14.734
And then you incubate it,
which means you keep it

00:03:14.734 --> 00:03:16.667
nice and toasty at the
perfect temperature

00:03:16.667 --> 00:03:18.066
that it wants to be at.

00:03:18.066 --> 00:03:21.000
I had always thought of myself
as a nature versus nurture kind

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:22.233
of paradigm.

00:03:22.233 --> 00:03:23.800
But the fact that
a totally different

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:29.567
organism could also co-make
me was really fascinating.

00:03:29.567 --> 00:03:32.367
I think it's especially
important in the technological

00:03:32.367 --> 00:03:35.900
landscape to include
artists because, you know,

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:39.166
scientists and technologists
strive so hard to make

00:03:39.166 --> 00:03:40.834
the world a better place.

00:03:40.834 --> 00:03:47.066
And so much of what I strive
to do is ask, what is better?

00:03:47.066 --> 00:03:48.266
Who is better?

00:03:48.266 --> 00:03:49.767
Who is it better for?

00:03:49.767 --> 00:03:54.900
Is it better for you, for
me, for a child, for a man?

00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:56.300
These are really
charged questions

00:03:56.300 --> 00:03:59.133
that I think artists
can fearlessly

00:03:59.133 --> 00:04:02.367
ask when they use these media.
