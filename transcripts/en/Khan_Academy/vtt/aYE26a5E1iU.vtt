00:00:01.120 --> 00:00:03.160
Welcome to level
three exponents.

00:00:03.160 --> 00:00:05.200
Let's get started.

00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:12.590
So if I asked you what 4 to the
1/2 power is, your immediate

00:00:12.590 --> 00:00:14.660
inclination is to view this
probably as like a

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:18.800
multiplication problem and try
to multiply it somehow or add

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:19.750
them or something.

00:00:19.750 --> 00:00:21.430
And you always have to
remind yourself this

00:00:21.430 --> 00:00:22.340
is not multiplication.

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:24.730
I know when I first learned it,
I always was tempted to do

00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:26.620
something with multiplication.

00:00:26.620 --> 00:00:29.820
Well, something to the 1/2
power might not be intuitive to

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:32.870
you, but it actually turns out
that this means the same thing

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:36.260
as the square root of 4.

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:40.390
Or another way, what times
itself is equal to 4,

00:00:40.390 --> 00:00:43.600
and we know that the
square root of 4 is 2.

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:47.090
It could actually be a positive
2 or a negative 2 because we

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:49.830
know that either of those
numbers when they're

00:00:49.830 --> 00:00:51.530
squared could equal 4.

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:54.090
But for the sake of this one
we'll assume it's always

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:55.110
the positive square root.

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:58.610
So 4 to the 1/2 is equal to 2.

00:00:58.610 --> 00:01:05.510
Similarly, 9 to the 1/2,
well that would be 3.

00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:09.710
16 to the 1/2 -- oops.

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:13.270
16 to the 1/2, my subconscious
gave away the answer.

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:15.920
16 to the 1/2 power is 4.

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:22.140
25 to the 1/2 power is 5.

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:24.170
I think that might make
sense to you now.

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:27.740
So what does it mean when
something is to the 1/3 power?

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:32.950
Well, if I say 8 to the
1/3 power, you might

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:34.260
already catch on.

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:36.522
In the 1/2 power we said
something times something

00:01:36.522 --> 00:01:38.190
is equal to 4.

00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:41.600
Well in the 1/3 power we have
to say that something to the

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:43.530
third power is equal to 8.

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:46.730
And if you've been practicing
your exponents you know that 2

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:50.060
to the third power
is equal to 8.

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:55.060
So we know that 8 to
the 1/3 is equal to 2.

00:01:55.060 --> 00:02:02.906
Similarly, 27 to the
1/3 is equal to 3.

00:02:02.906 --> 00:02:08.750
And 64 to the 1/3
is equal to 4.

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:10.920
You might notice that I'm
picking particular numbers,

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:13.050
like 8 and 27, 64.

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:15.060
That's because they have
clean, cube roots.

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:17.050
And then by the way, when
something is to the 1/3 power

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:20.480
that's the same thing as
saying the cube root.

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:22.190
I just used terminology
without explaining it,

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:25.250
which is very bad.

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:28.900
So I just used 8 and 27 and 64
because when I raised them to

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:31.010
the fractional exponents, they
actually come out to

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:31.740
be clean numbers.

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:34.290
You could use a calculator and
do something like 5 to the 1/3

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:36.710
power and you'll get
some weird decimal.

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:37.695
Let's do some more problems.

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:49.530
So we know that 9 to
the 1/2 is equal to 3.

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:54.930
Well what do you think 9
to the 2/3 is equal to?

00:02:54.930 --> 00:03:00.970
Well, it turns out that this is
equivalent to 9 to the -- oops,

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:05.580
I actually didn't want to do
those -- what do you think 9

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:08.860
to the 3/2 is equivalent to?

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:14.650
Well this is the same thing
as 9 to the 1/2 power

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:15.580
to the third power.

00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:20.400
And I'll do a whole
presentation on the actual

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:24.020
principles of exponents, but
it actually turns out you

00:03:24.020 --> 00:03:24.800
could just multiply.

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:26.920
When you have one exponent
to another is when you can

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:28.920
multiply the two and that's
where you get 3/2 .

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:32.950
But 9 to the 1/2 we know is 3.

00:03:32.950 --> 00:03:36.690
And you're raising it to the
third power, so that equals 27.

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:38.740
I'm sure at this point
I have confused you.

00:03:38.740 --> 00:03:42.050
Let's do more of these.

00:03:42.050 --> 00:03:47.370
So you know at this point
that 16 to the 1/4 power --

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:48.270
think about what that is.

00:03:48.270 --> 00:03:51.500
That means that some number
to the fourth power is 16.

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:54.030
If you've been practicing your
level one exponents, you'll

00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:58.820
probably know that well, that
equals 2, because 2 times 2

00:03:58.820 --> 00:04:01.920
times 2 times 2, well
that equals 16.

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:06.320
So we know that 16 to
the 1/4 is equal to 2.

00:04:06.320 --> 00:04:11.740
So what do you think 16
to the 2/4 is equal to?

00:04:11.740 --> 00:04:14.270
Well, we already know from that
last problem that that's the

00:04:14.270 --> 00:04:21.710
same thing as 16 to the 1/4
squared -- that's the 2 on both

00:04:21.710 --> 00:04:26.340
sides -- and we know 16 to the
1/4 is 2, so that equals 2

00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:29.600
squared and that equals 4.

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:32.790
And it all works out because we
know from fractions another way

00:04:32.790 --> 00:04:35.200
to write the fraction
2/4 is to write 1/2.

00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:40.270
So this is the same thing
as 16 to the 1/2 power.

00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:45.410
16 to the 1/2 power, well
that's just equal to 4.

00:04:45.410 --> 00:04:48.790
Now I'm going to mix it up real
good and do some negative

00:04:48.790 --> 00:04:50.790
fractional exponents.

00:04:50.790 --> 00:04:56.680
So what if I were to tell you
16 to the negative 1/2 power?

00:04:56.680 --> 00:04:59.400
Well this might seem very
daunting at first, but as we

00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:01.460
know with the negative
exponents level three,

00:05:01.460 --> 00:05:04.170
immediately we just say well
this is the same thing as 1

00:05:04.170 --> 00:05:11.170
over 16 to the positive 1/2.

00:05:11.170 --> 00:05:17.910
And that's the same thing as 1
to the 1/2 over 16 to the 1/2.

00:05:17.910 --> 00:05:20.640
Well the square root
of 1 is easy, it's 1.

00:05:20.640 --> 00:05:23.130
And 16 to the 1/2 is 4.

00:05:23.130 --> 00:05:24.300
So that wasn't too bad.

00:05:24.300 --> 00:05:26.500
It's a little daunting when you
see a negative exponent, but

00:05:26.500 --> 00:05:29.640
immediately when you see that
negative, just flip the 16 and

00:05:29.640 --> 00:05:33.320
then work it out like a regular
fractional exponent problem.

00:05:33.320 --> 00:05:34.070
Let's do another one.

00:05:38.480 --> 00:05:51.980
8 over 27 to the negative 1/3.

00:05:51.980 --> 00:05:53.660
Immediately when we
see that negative, we

00:05:53.660 --> 00:05:54.560
want to just flip it.

00:05:54.560 --> 00:06:03.440
So we'll say that equals 27
over 8 to the 1/3, and that

00:06:03.440 --> 00:06:11.060
equals 27 to the 1/3
over 8 to the 1/3.

00:06:11.060 --> 00:06:15.860
And we know that 27 to the
1/3, well that equals 3.

00:06:15.860 --> 00:06:20.720
And 8 to the 1/3,
well that equals 2.

00:06:20.720 --> 00:06:26.275
So we've got 8 over 27 to
the negative 1/3 is 3/2.

00:06:26.275 --> 00:06:28.170
The first problem probably
looked very intimidating to

00:06:28.170 --> 00:06:30.280
you, but it only took us two
steps to get there and as you

00:06:30.280 --> 00:06:32.330
do more practice, hopefully
it'll seem more and

00:06:32.330 --> 00:06:34.070
more intuitive to you.

00:06:34.070 --> 00:06:36.760
Let me give you
another problem.

00:06:36.760 --> 00:06:40.890
What's negative 8 to the
negative third power?

00:06:43.990 --> 00:06:44.710
Let me change that.

00:06:44.710 --> 00:06:51.250
What's negative 8 to the
negative 1/3 power?

00:06:51.250 --> 00:06:53.430
Once again, at first this might
confuse you, but when you see

00:06:53.430 --> 00:06:55.590
that negative in the exponent,
we just take the reciprocal of

00:06:55.590 --> 00:06:59.690
the base, so that we say that
that is equal to negative 1

00:06:59.690 --> 00:07:06.680
over 8 to the 1/3 power.

00:07:06.680 --> 00:07:13.650
And we say well that is equal
to, we could write it as 1

00:07:13.650 --> 00:07:16.770
over negative 8 to the 1/3.

00:07:16.770 --> 00:07:21.280
We say what number times itself
3 times is equal to negative 8?

00:07:21.280 --> 00:07:24.540
Well, we know from intuition
there's no real mechanical way

00:07:24.540 --> 00:07:28.440
to do this, but we know that
negative 2 times negative 2 is

00:07:28.440 --> 00:07:31.060
4 times negative
2 is negative 8.

00:07:31.060 --> 00:07:34.340
So we know that this is
equal to 1 over negative

00:07:34.340 --> 00:07:37.956
2 or negative 1/2.

00:07:37.956 --> 00:07:41.175
So negative eight to
the negative 1/3 is

00:07:41.175 --> 00:07:45.210
equal to minus 1/2.

00:07:45.210 --> 00:07:48.760
Let's do another one, one more
problem just to thoroughly

00:07:48.760 --> 00:07:51.070
melt your brain.

00:07:51.070 --> 00:08:03.260
Let's say 9 over 4 to
the negative 3 over 2.

00:08:03.260 --> 00:08:06.170
Well, immediately we see
that negative exponent,

00:08:06.170 --> 00:08:07.670
let's flip the base.

00:08:07.670 --> 00:08:13.250
We get 4 over 9 to the 3/2 .

00:08:13.250 --> 00:08:22.510
Well we know that that equals
4 over 9 to the 1/2, and all

00:08:22.510 --> 00:08:25.700
of that to the third power.

00:08:25.700 --> 00:08:28.100
4 over 9 to the 1/2, I think at
this point you know that's the

00:08:28.100 --> 00:08:31.470
same thing as 4 to the 1/2
which is 2 over 9 to

00:08:31.470 --> 00:08:33.400
the 1/2 which is 3.

00:08:33.400 --> 00:08:37.520
Now we have to just raise
everything to the third power.

00:08:37.520 --> 00:08:39.950
And that's the same thing as
2 the third power which is

00:08:39.950 --> 00:08:45.400
8 divided by 3 to
the third power.

00:08:45.400 --> 00:08:48.030
Well that's 27.

00:08:48.030 --> 00:08:52.470
There we have 9/4 to the
negative 3/2 power is

00:08:52.470 --> 00:08:55.090
equal to 8 over 27.

00:08:55.090 --> 00:08:57.410
Now hopefully you can at
least do these problems.

00:08:57.410 --> 00:09:00.920
You probably don't have a good
intuitive sense for exactly

00:09:00.920 --> 00:09:04.650
what a negative 3/2 power is,
and hopefully I can cover that

00:09:04.650 --> 00:09:06.580
for you in future modules.

00:09:06.580 --> 00:09:08.710
But I think you're ready to
try some of the level three

00:09:08.710 --> 00:09:10.310
exponent practice problems.

00:09:10.310 --> 00:09:11.830
Have fun.
