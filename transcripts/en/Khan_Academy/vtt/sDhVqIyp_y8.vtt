00:00:00.750 --> 00:00:03.990
Write a binomial to express
the difference between the

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:08.109
area of a rectangle with length
p and width 2r and the

00:00:08.109 --> 00:00:10.440
area of a circle with
diameter 4r.

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:13.610
And they tell us that p
is greater than 4r.

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:15.640
So the first thing that might
be a little confusing, say,

00:00:15.640 --> 00:00:16.600
write a binomial.

00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:17.750
You're like, what's
a binomial?

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:20.930
All a binomial is is an
expression with two terms. And

00:00:20.930 --> 00:00:22.560
really, just to do this,
you pretty much

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:23.720
have to write a binomial.

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:25.470
I'll show you what
that's all about.

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:30.400
So they want us to express the
difference between-- and I'll

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:31.220
color code this.

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:37.060
Between-- in pink-- the area of
a rectangle with length p

00:00:37.060 --> 00:00:45.590
and width 2r, and the area of
a circle with diameter 4r.

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:47.350
So let's think about each
of these independently.

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:50.710
So we have the area of a
rectangle first. So the area

00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:55.450
of a rectangle, let's say
that is our rectangle.

00:00:55.450 --> 00:00:58.300
And it has a length
p and width 2r.

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:04.830
So we know the area of a
rectangle is going to be the

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:06.530
length times the width.

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:10.800
So the area here is going
to be p times 2r.

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:13.220
We could say 2rp.

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:14.920
That is the area of
the rectangle.

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:18.220
Let's think about the area of
the circle with diameter 4r.

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:21.460
So let me draw a circle here.

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:22.840
That's our circle.

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:27.180
The diameter of the
circle is 4r.

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:32.050
And we know that the area
of a circle is 4pi

00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:34.440
times the radius squared.

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:36.130
Oh actually, I almost
have made a mistake.

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:38.390
The diameter is 4r,
not the radius.

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:39.650
Let me be very clear.

00:01:39.650 --> 00:01:40.880
Diameter 4r.

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:43.000
So diameter is two radiuses.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.970
This whole thing, this whole
distance-- I almost made a

00:01:45.970 --> 00:01:48.860
blunder-- this whole
distance is 4r.

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:50.780
The diameter is 4r.

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:52.970
So the radius is going
to be 1/2 that.

00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:54.560
The radius is going to be 2r.

00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:01.830
And we know that the area
of a circle is pi

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:03.720
times the radius squared.

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:06.110
In this case, the
radius is 2r.

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:13.820
pi times 2r squared, which is
equal to pi times 4r squared.

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:15.840
2 squared times r squared.

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:19.670
Or we could just say that's
4pi r squared.

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:23.300
Now, they want us to write
a binomial to express the

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:26.650
difference between this thing,
the difference between the

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:30.650
area of the rectangle and
the area of the circle.

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:32.790
And this thing right
over here.

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:33.760
So what's the difference?

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:36.050
Well, it's going to be this
thing minus that thing.

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:42.120
So it's going to be 2rp minus--
since I underlined

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:46.360
difference in orange, I'll put
the minus in orange as well--

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:51.260
minus 4pi r squared.

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:52.130
And we're done.

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:54.230
This is a binomial.

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:56.150
We have two terms here.

00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:57.070
That's why it's binomial.

00:02:57.070 --> 00:02:59.600
If it had three terms,
it'd be trinomial.

00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:01.470
If there was kind of an
arbitrary number of terms with

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:03.580
more than one, you'd call
it a polynomial.

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:06.750
If you only have one term here,
you call it a monomial.

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:09.850
So we are done.
