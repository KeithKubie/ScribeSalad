VINCENT VANHOUCKE:
So you've heard

00:00:01.250 --> 00:00:03.458
of deep learning, one of
the hottest areas in machine

00:00:03.458 --> 00:00:04.450
learning today.

00:00:04.450 --> 00:00:06.580
Wondering what the
buzz is all about?

00:00:06.580 --> 00:00:09.006
Problems you want to solve,
but not sure where to start?

00:00:09.006 --> 00:00:10.755
Take this Udacity
course on deep learning,

00:00:10.755 --> 00:00:12.325
and let's start exploring.

00:00:12.325 --> 00:00:14.450
Through hands-on
assignments, you

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:16.250
will learn how to build
progressively more

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:20.120
complex models using Google's
open source TensorFlow library.

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:22.410
Learn all about
deep nets, ConvNets,

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:25.090
embeddings, and
LSTMs, and use them

00:00:25.090 --> 00:00:28.280
to solve a variety of problems,
like classifying images

00:00:28.280 --> 00:00:29.850
and predicting
sequences of text.

00:00:29.850 --> 00:00:32.110
So what are you waiting for?

00:00:32.110 --> 00:00:33.740
Enroll in this
course and see what

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:36.110
deep learning can do for you.
