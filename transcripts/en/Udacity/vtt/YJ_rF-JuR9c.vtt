00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:02.250
We build a wider detail 
fragment layout,

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:04.260
using a horizontal LinearLayout

00:00:04.260 --> 00:00:06.270
composed of three vertical
LinearLayouts.

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:08.280
This is what the XML code looks like.

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:10.264
And you can see it linked below.

00:00:10.264 --> 00:00:12.248
Then we use layout aliasing
to override

00:00:12.248 --> 00:00:14.425
the fragment_detail layout.

00:00:14.425 --> 00:00:17.482
In the values-land
and values-sw600dp folders,

00:00:17.482 --> 00:00:19.570
we create res.xml files.

00:00:19.570 --> 00:00:21.916
In both files, we alias 
fragment_detail

00:00:21.916 --> 00:00:23.312
through fragment detail wide.

00:00:23.312 --> 00:00:26.000
And now we have a more
responsive layout to wider screens.
