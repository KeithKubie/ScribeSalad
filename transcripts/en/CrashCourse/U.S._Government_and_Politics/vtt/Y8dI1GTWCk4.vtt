00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:07.180
Hi, I'm Craig, and this is Crash Course
Government and Politics, and I'm excited.

00:00:07.180 --> 00:00:10.799
I'm excited because today, we start delving
into Supreme Court jurisprudence, with the

00:00:10.799 --> 00:00:14.900
totally controversial topic of freedom of
religion. Now, other than being fun to say,

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:19.060
jurisprudence means all the important cases
on a particular topic, but unfortunately,

00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:21.869
I'm only going to be talking about a couple
of them, because they demonstrate how the

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:27.580
Supreme Court reasons its way through a tricky
issue. Jurisprudence. Jurisprudence.

00:00:27.580 --> 00:00:36.460
[Theme Music]

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:40.160
So the Constitution deals with religion right
there in the First Amendment, which is also

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:44.270
the one that deals with speech and the press
and assembly and petitions. Here's what it

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:47.570
says: "Congress shall make no law respecting
an establishment of religion or prohibiting

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:51.300
the free exercise thereof." It's the first
clause in the First Amendment of the Bill

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:54.969
of Rights, so it's pretty darn important.
Notice it has two parts, and each one creates

00:00:54.969 --> 00:00:58.780
a separate religious liberty or freedom. The
first part, "no law respecting an establishment

00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:02.620
of religion" is caused the establishment clause;
can you guess what the second religious liberty

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:06.900
is? If you said free exercise, you're right.
What do these two freedoms mean, though?

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:09.750
Establishment of religion means that the US
can't create an official state church, like

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:13.600
England has with the church of England. This
means that the First Amendment ensures that the US

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:18.460
does not have any state endorsed religion nor does it
write its laws based on any religious edicts, and it's also

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:22.320
the clause in the Constitution that deals with religious
monuments and school prayers and stuff like that.

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:26.740
The free exercise clause in a way is more
straightforward, it means you can't pay for exercise.

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:30.840
Gym memberships are illegal. But freedom
isn't free. You're gonna pay with pain!

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:34.220
No pain, no gain. Actually, none of
that is what we're talking about.

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:37.980
What it means is you can't be prohibited from being
part of a certain religion, although it doesn't

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:41.470
mean that any religious practice is okay.
For example, if your religion requires human

00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:45.170
sacrifice, because you're an Aztec, state,
local, and federal law could prevent you from

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:49.090
practicing that aspect of religion, for obvious
reasons, although it couldn't prevent you

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:53.050
from believing that human sacrifices were
necessary to make the sun rise every day.

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:55.070
We are gonna anger a lot of Aztecs with this
video, Stan.

00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:58.670
There are a number of cases that establish
this distinction between religious belief

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:03.380
and religious practice, but my personal favorite
is Church of Lukumi Babalu Aye vs. Hialeah,

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:06.960
because I love saying Lukumi Babalu Aye. You
probably figured out that what these two clauses

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:10.849
mean in practice has been determined to some
degree by Supreme Court decisions. There's

00:02:10.849 --> 00:02:15.560
a bunch of them, but probably the most important
one is called Lemon v. Kurtzman, from 1971.

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:18.680
Right off the bat, the Lemon decision is a
little complicated because it combines two

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:22.450
sets of facts, although they both involve
public money and parochial schools. In one

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:25.969
case in Rhode Island, the state was using
taxpayer funds to pay teachers in parochial

00:02:25.969 --> 00:02:29.930
schools in an effort to educate Rhode Island
children, which is generally a good goal.

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:33.219
In the other case in Pennsylvania, the state
was paying teachers in private schools to

00:02:33.219 --> 00:02:37.219
provide secular education services, but enough
with the set-up, let's go to the Thought Bubble.

00:02:37.219 --> 00:02:42.099
The Supreme Court in Lemon vs. Kurtzman devised
a three prong test to see if the state law

00:02:42.099 --> 00:02:45.459
violates the First Amendment religious freedom
clauses. Under the first prong, the Court

00:02:45.459 --> 00:02:49.480
looks to see whether the law in question has
a secular legislative purpose. In this case,

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:53.170
the purpose of the law was educating children,
which you remember, is one of the powers reserved

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:55.909
to the states, and for the most part, is a
secular purpose.

00:02:55.909 --> 00:02:59.439
Under the second prong, the Court examines
whether or not the law's principal or primary

00:02:59.439 --> 00:03:03.319
effect neither enhances nor inhibits religion.
Here again, the Court found that paying private

00:03:03.319 --> 00:03:07.420
school teachers or using private school facilities
did not necessarily promote religion or prevent

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:09.329
students from worshipping as they wanted to.

00:03:09.329 --> 00:03:13.249
The third prong requires that the law under
consideration does not create excessive entanglement

00:03:13.249 --> 00:03:16.430
between a church and the state. This is the
one where both the Rhode Island and Pennsylvania

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:19.689
laws got into trouble. In Rhode Island, the
school buildings where the children were learning

00:03:19.689 --> 00:03:23.329
were full of religious imagery, and 2/3 of
the teachers were nuns. The Court paid close

00:03:23.329 --> 00:03:27.599
attention the fact that the people involved
were kids, ruling, "This process of inculcating

00:03:27.599 --> 00:03:31.290
religious doctrine is, of course, enhanced
by the impressionable age of the pupils in

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:35.680
primary schools particularly. In short, parochial
schools involve substantial religious activity

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:38.959
and purpose." In Pennsylvania, the problem
was different. The Court ruled that in order

00:03:38.959 --> 00:03:42.349
to make sure that the teachers were NOT teaching
religion, the state would have to monitor

00:03:42.349 --> 00:03:45.959
them so closely that it would be excessive
entanglement and give the state way too much

00:03:45.959 --> 00:03:49.980
control. They ruled that, "The very restrictions
in surveillance necessary to ensure that teachers

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:54.310
play a strictly non-ideological role give
rise to entanglements between church and state."

00:03:54.310 --> 00:03:58.550
Thanks, Thought Bubble. So it's pretty complicated,
and I'm not 100% sure that I find it convincing.

00:03:58.550 --> 00:04:03.000
First of all, the Justices engaged in some slippery
slope reasoning about the Pennsylvania case.

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:06.639
The Court argued that even if, in this situation,
the secular purpose was a good one, there's

00:04:06.639 --> 00:04:10.480
a tendency for states to take more and more
power for themselves. But my bigger concern

00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:13.639
is that all three prongs in this case were
given equal weight, and I'm not sure that

00:04:13.639 --> 00:04:17.470
they always should be. I mean, you got the
one round one and then the two like, you know,

00:04:17.470 --> 00:04:19.840
long ones, and you can pull that round one,
it's just for grounding.

00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:23.520
What the ruling in this case meant was that
the secular purpose, educating children, was

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:26.680
not gonna happen, or at least would be made
more difficult. Also, you could argue that

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:30.010
it was kind of paternalistic, assuming that
kids wouldn't be able to block out religious

00:04:30.010 --> 00:04:34.480
imagery, but since they are kids, maybe a little
paternalism is okay. You spit that gum out, Junior.

00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:38.840
So Lemon vs. Kurtzman built on an earlier
case, Engel vs. Vitale, which ruled that prayer

00:04:38.850 --> 00:04:42.480
in schools violated religious freedom. You
would think that, taken together, this issue

00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:45.870
would be pretty much put to bed, yet every
few years, a case comes along involving prayer

00:04:45.870 --> 00:04:49.980
in school, and now they apply the old three
prong Lemon test. For example, one state adopted

00:04:49.980 --> 00:04:53.730
a statute mandating a moment of silence at
the beginning of each school day. One of the

00:04:53.730 --> 00:04:57.440
purposes of this statute is to provide students
with an opportunity to pray in school. Another

00:04:57.440 --> 00:05:01.080
purpose is to create a calming atmosphere
in the classroom to better promote learning.

00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:04.950
The first purpose doesn't look so secular,
and as for the second prong, doesn't necessarily

00:05:04.950 --> 00:05:08.450
advance or inhibit a particular religion.
Students can choose not to pray at all. Is

00:05:08.450 --> 00:05:12.160
this excessive entanglement? That's always
gonna be difficult to say, especially since

00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:15.890
'excessive' is pretty subjective, but if you
go on the standard of the Pennsylvania case

00:05:15.890 --> 00:05:19.830
in Lemon, almost any religious practice in
school could be excessively entangling, because

00:05:19.830 --> 00:05:21.730
the state is going to have to step in and
monitor it.

00:05:21.730 --> 00:05:24.910
Some school systems have tried to get around
this by having the prayers led by students,

00:05:24.910 --> 00:05:28.140
because they aren't agents of the state. But
then you have the issue of how much a student-led

00:05:28.140 --> 00:05:31.670
prayer is really led by a student, and how
do you find out without more monitoring and

00:05:31.670 --> 00:05:35.300
more state entanglement? The Lemon test is
an attempt by the Court to set up a framework

00:05:35.300 --> 00:05:39.020
for analyzing future situations where religion
and the state might get mixed up. It's probably

00:05:39.020 --> 00:05:42.390
better than having what legal scholars like
to call "a bright line rule" about religion

00:05:42.390 --> 00:05:46.420
in public spaces like schools and courthouses,
but it does leave a lot of wiggle room and

00:05:46.420 --> 00:05:50.380
it seems that it encourages future cases because
we keep seeing them. The funny thing is, religious

00:05:50.380 --> 00:05:54.030
freedom is one of the less controversial protections
found in the First Amendment, if you don't

00:05:54.030 --> 00:06:00.310
believe me, wait until our next episode on
free speech. Just wait. You just -- you just wait.

00:06:01.300 --> 00:06:04.000
