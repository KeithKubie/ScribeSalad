many years ago many five six seven eight
years ago it was obvious to me and it

00:00:05.450 --> 00:00:05.460
years ago it was obvious to me and it
 

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:07.190
years ago it was obvious to me and it
was really obvious to my entire field

00:00:07.190 --> 00:00:07.200
was really obvious to my entire field
 

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:10.310

Collider was finally the experiment that
could go to the energy level where we

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:16.170
could go to the energy level where we
 

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:18.380
could go to the energy level where we
would answer questions that we've been

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:18.390
would answer questions that we've been
 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:21.140
would answer questions that we've been
basically asking our entire careers we

entire population of particle physicists
 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:28.279
entire population of particle physicists
were still active in the field had never

were still active in the field had never
 

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:30.980
were still active in the field had never
seen a discovery at this level and we

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:30.990
seen a discovery at this level and we
 

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:32.600
seen a discovery at this level and we
knew it was coming you could do the

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:32.610
knew it was coming you could do the
 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:35.389
knew it was coming you could do the
calculation and and decide immediately

film and the thing that is coming or was
 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:45.080
film and the thing that is coming or was
coming was really a statement about how

ideas that have been coming out in the
 

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:08.270
ideas that have been coming out in the
last ten years is the idea of a

as we measure them they're a reflection
 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:20.749
as we measure them they're a reflection
of one possible way the physical reality

of one possible way the physical reality
 

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:25.160
of one possible way the physical reality
could be and the multiverse is a much

more physical example of how you could

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.090
more physical example of how you could
 

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:29.270
more physical example of how you could
imagine different possibilities of

where we measure things in our entire

00:01:34.999 --> 00:01:35.009
where we measure things in our entire
 

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:37.190
where we measure things in our entire
observable universe and then what's

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:37.200
observable universe and then what's
 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:40.310
observable universe and then what's
outside of it and while that all sounds

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:40.320
outside of it and while that all sounds
 

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:45.700
outside of it and while that all sounds
very dramatic and exciting it is both

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:45.710
very dramatic and exciting it is both
 

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:48.080
very dramatic and exciting it is both
something that scientists can think

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:48.090
something that scientists can think
 

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:50.210
something that scientists can think
about in great detail and try to figure

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:50.220
about in great detail and try to figure
 

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:53.480
about in great detail and try to figure
out and sociologically it's a little bit

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:53.490
out and sociologically it's a little bit
 

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:56.840
out and sociologically it's a little bit
of a nightmare scenario which is are we

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:56.850
of a nightmare scenario which is are we
 

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:59.149
of a nightmare scenario which is are we
going to come to the point in this

00:01:59.149 --> 00:01:59.159
going to come to the point in this
 

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:01.399
going to come to the point in this
direction where the numbers we measure

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:01.409
direction where the numbers we measure
 

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:03.709
direction where the numbers we measure
and the equations that sort of describe

00:02:03.709 --> 00:02:03.719
and the equations that sort of describe
 

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:06.830
and the equations that sort of describe
as much of physics as possible were

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:06.840
as much of physics as possible were
 

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:09.260
as much of physics as possible were
really generated randomly that they

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:09.270
really generated randomly that they
 

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:11.180
really generated randomly that they
actually came out of a whole bath of

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:11.190
actually came out of a whole bath of
 

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:13.640
actually came out of a whole bath of
possible laws of physics

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:13.650
possible laws of physics
 

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:15.649
possible laws of physics
and the ones we measure are the ones

00:02:15.649 --> 00:02:15.659
and the ones we measure are the ones
 

00:02:15.659 --> 00:02:18.949
and the ones we measure are the ones
that generate structure in our universe

00:02:18.949 --> 00:02:18.959
that generate structure in our universe
 

00:02:18.959 --> 00:02:21.199
that generate structure in our universe
and therefore life and therefore human

00:02:21.199 --> 00:02:21.209
and therefore life and therefore human
 

00:02:21.209 --> 00:02:24.380
and therefore life and therefore human
beings and so we are biased by what we

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:24.390
beings and so we are biased by what we
 

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:26.300
beings and so we are biased by what we
measure by the fact that we're here and

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:26.310
measure by the fact that we're here and
 

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:29.449
measure by the fact that we're here and
we're measuring it that the universe or

00:02:29.449 --> 00:02:29.459
we're measuring it that the universe or
 

00:02:29.459 --> 00:02:31.520
we're measuring it that the universe or
part of the universe we're in has enough

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:31.530
part of the universe we're in has enough
 

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:34.089
part of the universe we're in has enough
structure and complexity to produce

structure and complexity to produce
 

00:02:34.099 --> 00:02:36.860

sort of drama the deep drama that was

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:46.440
sort of drama the deep drama that was
 

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:50.119
sort of drama the deep drama that was
actually going on in the mid 2000s when

00:02:50.119 --> 00:02:50.129
actually going on in the mid 2000s when
 

00:02:50.129 --> 00:02:52.039
actually going on in the mid 2000s when
I decided that somebody needed to record

00:02:52.039 --> 00:02:52.049
I decided that somebody needed to record
 

00:02:52.049 --> 00:02:54.680
I decided that somebody needed to record
this event and what I knew is whatever

the LHC saw or didn't see it would
 

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:01.399
the LHC saw or didn't see it would
inform us along those lines emotionally

00:03:01.399 --> 00:03:01.409
inform us along those lines emotionally
 

00:03:01.409 --> 00:03:03.349
inform us along those lines emotionally
it was going to be very dramatic no

00:03:03.349 --> 00:03:03.359
it was going to be very dramatic no
 

00:03:03.359 --> 00:03:05.119
it was going to be very dramatic no
matter what we didn't know we would

matter what we didn't know we would
 

00:03:05.129 --> 00:03:06.860
matter what we didn't know we would
discover the Higgs that that would be

discover the Higgs that that would be

we the community knew that this was so
big and this was generational that it's

00:03:17.119 --> 00:03:17.129
big and this was generational that it's
 

00:03:17.129 --> 00:03:20.030
big and this was generational that it's
going to affect everybody
