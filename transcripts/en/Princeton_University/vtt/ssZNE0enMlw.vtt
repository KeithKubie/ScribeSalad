NANCY WEISS MALKIEL: "Keep
the damned women out."

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:02.730
[LOCKING SOUND]

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:05.040
The Struggle for Coeducation.

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:07.470
I'm Nancy Weiss Malkiel.

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:10.300
When I was finishing up
as dean, President Tilghman

00:00:10.300 --> 00:00:13.650
asked me if I would be
interested in writing a history

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:16.350
of coeducation at Princeton.

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:19.080
And I said, sure.

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:24.390
After all, I had experienced
all of coeducation

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:27.180
at Princeton from
the very beginning,

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:31.680
in terms of chronology and
being here as a faculty member.

00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:35.220
I had had responsibility
for the education of women

00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:37.620
as well as the education of men.

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:40.680
And as an alumna and
trustee of Smith,

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:43.710
I was very interested
in women's education

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:45.990
from that point of view.

00:00:45.990 --> 00:00:48.930
I made up a timeline
of who went co-ed when.

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:51.750
I had a hard enough time keeping
this straight for myself,

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:54.180
and I figured that other
people would be even less

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:55.650
familiar with it than I would.

00:00:55.650 --> 00:01:01.740
And I saw this huge bunching
between 1969 and '74,

00:01:01.740 --> 00:01:07.290
and said to myself, that's a
much more interesting question.

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:12.270
Why did all of these
schools go co-ed all at once

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:15.210
in this very short
space of time?

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:19.230
So I thought, I really need
to locate Princeton much more

00:01:19.230 --> 00:01:24.060
firmly in the context of
this much broader movement

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:28.520
toward coeducation, which is
how I came to write the book.

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:32.700
It's a quote from a
Dartmouth alumnus writing

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:35.880
to the board of trustees
as Dartmouth was beginning

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:37.920
to discuss coeducation.

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:42.330
And he wrote, "For God's
sake, for Dartmouth's sake,

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:46.470
and for everyone's sake,
keep the damned women out."

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:52.330
It's a book about how very
traditional, very conservative,

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:57.450
very elite, very old colleges
and universities came

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:02.010
to decide that they would
undertake a major change,

00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:05.100
which is to say, the
admission of women.

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:10.710
And it's about how
complicated it is to engage

00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:12.600
in institutional change.

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:17.130
So I look at the
role of leadership

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:21.210
I look at the role of
process and planning.

00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:23.220
And there's quite
a lot of difference

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:25.260
among institutions
and the extent

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:27.990
to which process matters.

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:32.220
At Princeton, process
mattered hugely,

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:36.960
very careful planning
and analysis.

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:40.560
Bill was an
extraordinary leader.

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:43.800
When he was invited
by Bob Goheen

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:49.530
to become the first full-time
provost of the university,

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:52.230
he said it was clear
to him, to Bill,

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:55.250
that Princeton
needed to go co-ed,

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:59.650
to remain an institution
of the highest quality.

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:02.880
And that it would be unable to
continue to attract first-rate

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:06.000
students and faculty
if it didn't.

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:11.490
I think that for women
and men, going to school

00:03:11.490 --> 00:03:17.010
together enriches the
intellectual experience.

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:21.660
You do have different
perspectives in the classroom

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:24.510
when you have men
and women together.

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:31.620
And you do learn about the way
other people see the world when

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:33.470
you have those perspectives.

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:36.760
It's true when you have
students of different racial,

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:40.330
and ethnic, and economic
backgrounds as well.

00:03:40.330 --> 00:03:44.520
You learn more when the
people you're talking with

00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:48.690
are not all the same as you are.

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:51.240
Outside the classroom,
participating

00:03:51.240 --> 00:03:54.600
in extracurricular
activities together

00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:58.200
enlarges your sense
of who makes things

00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:01.170
happen, how leadership works,

00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:07.200
enlarges your respect for people
who are different than you are.

00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:13.070
So I think it -- I think
it's a good thing.
