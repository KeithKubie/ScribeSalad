00:00:00.868 --> 00:00:01.834
Shen: My name
is Shawn Shen.

00:00:01.834 --> 00:00:04.901
I'm a developer advocate
out of Google.

00:00:04.901 --> 00:00:06.000
I appreciate
everyone coming.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:07.133
During lunchtime,
especially.

00:00:07.133 --> 00:00:08.634
I think we have
another session.

00:00:08.634 --> 00:00:13.567
Great news about Wave.
Google walk around technology.

00:00:13.567 --> 00:00:15.100
So they're
making big waves,

00:00:15.100 --> 00:00:18.334
but we're interested
in making money here.

00:00:18.334 --> 00:00:22.467
Here with me
is Chewy Trewhella from--

00:00:22.467 --> 00:00:25.434
he's also a Google
developer advocate from UK.

00:00:25.434 --> 00:00:27.901
And we're gonna enjoy
his beautiful British accent

00:00:27.901 --> 00:00:29.601
and his beautiful humor.

00:00:29.601 --> 00:00:33.868
And also Gerardo Capiel
from Myspace.

00:00:33.868 --> 00:00:35.767
He's a vice president
of Platform--

00:00:35.767 --> 00:00:38.434
Open Platform
at Myspace.

00:00:38.434 --> 00:00:40.934
And previously...

00:00:40.934 --> 00:00:44.033
So he--
so he founded...

00:00:44.033 --> 00:00:46.667
Most recently he founded
a company called Gydget.

00:00:46.667 --> 00:00:48.000
And previously
he was a co-founder

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.267
of a public company called
Digital Impact.

00:00:51.267 --> 00:00:52.434
So we're gonna
have him to share

00:00:52.434 --> 00:00:53.901
some of the greater
experiences

00:00:53.901 --> 00:00:55.834
in this social
application space,

00:00:55.834 --> 00:00:57.701
best practices,
and he's gonna review

00:00:57.701 --> 00:01:00.968
some of the revenue models--
how to make money.

00:01:00.968 --> 00:01:03.601
Well, I'm having
a great time here at I/O.

00:01:03.601 --> 00:01:05.601
I'm sure you guys
are having a great time too

00:01:05.601 --> 00:01:10.400
because yesterday when
I was doing the usual things,

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:12.400
meeting people,
having a great time,

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:13.534
and all of a sudden
I saw everybody

00:01:13.534 --> 00:01:15.834
having a little white box.

00:01:15.834 --> 00:01:18.501
And everybody is getting
a Magic G2 phone.

00:01:18.501 --> 00:01:21.000
So I went downstairs--
I wanted to get one for myself--

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.734
and then I was told that
as a Google I don't get one.

00:01:23.734 --> 00:01:24.767
Dang.

00:01:24.767 --> 00:01:26.200
And you guys
are having a great time.

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:28.334
Not only that--
on Ebay, I see that people

00:01:28.334 --> 00:01:31.534
are selling the G phone
for $650 already.

00:01:31.534 --> 00:01:33.000
So I'm sure
people are happy

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:38.601
because you guys
are making a profit already.

00:01:38.601 --> 00:01:43.367
In my experience working as
a developer advocate at Google,

00:01:43.367 --> 00:01:44.567
I have the honor
and privilege

00:01:44.567 --> 00:01:46.834
of working with
a lot of developers.

00:01:46.834 --> 00:01:47.901
Developers who are not only

00:01:47.901 --> 00:01:50.400
talented in writing
applications,

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:52.901
but also very, you know,
smart businessmen.

00:01:52.901 --> 00:01:54.400
And we're gonna--

00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:57.167
in this talk, we're gonna look
at many great applications

00:01:57.167 --> 00:02:00.767
in social space.

00:02:00.767 --> 00:02:04.767
You're gonna be amazed how many
ingenious ways people devise

00:02:04.767 --> 00:02:06.868
in order to make
your users pay you,

00:02:06.868 --> 00:02:08.901
and how to monetize
your application.

00:02:08.901 --> 00:02:11.400
So that's what
this is about.

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:15.100
In the end, we're gonna show you
how much money we can make.

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:19.868
So as I was thinking about
everybody getting a G phone,

00:02:19.868 --> 00:02:22.334
I was not getting one.

00:02:22.334 --> 00:02:26.434
But we're Google,
so we're supposed to do no evil.

00:02:26.434 --> 00:02:28.100
And I was thinking,
how can we top that?

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:32.334
How can we make this talk
even better than a G2?

00:02:32.334 --> 00:02:36.300
The title is "How To Build
A Business With Social Apps."

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:38.634
I figured that
I'd change the title

00:02:38.634 --> 00:02:42.200
to "How to Make a Million Bucks
with Social Applications."

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:43.567
so that's our goal,
you know,

00:02:43.567 --> 00:02:47.267
to show some ways
how to make a lot of dollars.

00:02:47.267 --> 00:02:51.601
So this is a profile
of a fellow developer.

00:02:51.601 --> 00:02:54.567
Some 30 years ago when
he was out there, you know,

00:02:54.567 --> 00:02:59.033
writing his code,
most people thought that

00:02:59.033 --> 00:03:04.834
sharing of information would
lead to innovation in software.

00:03:04.834 --> 00:03:06.167
And this developer,
he insisted

00:03:06.167 --> 00:03:08.167
everybody should pay him
for his software.

00:03:08.167 --> 00:03:10.067
And in doing that,
he basically created

00:03:10.067 --> 00:03:12.734
this commercial software
industry as we know today.

00:03:12.734 --> 00:03:14.100
And we know who he is now.

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:16.200
He's the most fam--
the richest guy in the world,

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:18.200
Mr. Bill Gates.

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:20.968
The point I'm trying to drive
here is that sky's the limit.

00:03:20.968 --> 00:03:22.434
How much money
are we gonna make?

00:03:22.434 --> 00:03:23.834
Well, we're gonna
find out.

00:03:23.834 --> 00:03:25.868
In 30 years,
we're gonna find out--

00:03:25.868 --> 00:03:27.534
probably from this crowd--

00:03:27.534 --> 00:03:30.667
some billionaires
out of many great projects

00:03:30.667 --> 00:03:32.567
that we're gonna do.

00:03:32.567 --> 00:03:35.400
So here's the agenda
we're gonna talk about today.

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:38.267
Most people are probably
Web application developers.

00:03:38.267 --> 00:03:41.267
We are familiar
with typical Web applications.

00:03:41.267 --> 00:03:43.734
So we're gonna
talk about it first.

00:03:43.734 --> 00:03:45.901
What are the benefits
of taking your Web application

00:03:45.901 --> 00:03:47.200
to a social arena,

00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:49.467
and what are the advantages
of doing that?

00:03:49.467 --> 00:03:50.701
And then Chewy is gonna talk

00:03:50.701 --> 00:03:52.968
about the landscape
of social applications.

00:03:52.968 --> 00:03:55.133
And Gerardo will cover
the revenue models--

00:03:55.133 --> 00:03:57.701
various ways you can make money,
and Chewy will come back

00:03:57.701 --> 00:04:01.868
to talk about, you know,
costs, and operations.

00:04:01.868 --> 00:04:03.667
And Gerardo will cover--

00:04:03.667 --> 00:04:06.634
share some of the best
practices in this space.

00:04:06.634 --> 00:04:09.033
And then finally I will
come back to share with you

00:04:09.033 --> 00:04:11.067
some of the numbers
that we see in this industry.

00:04:11.067 --> 00:04:12.801
And it really show you
how much money

00:04:12.801 --> 00:04:16.167
you can make if you have
a small application,

00:04:16.167 --> 00:04:17.501
or a medium application,

00:04:17.501 --> 00:04:21.267
or really a big blockbuster hit
like a big application.

00:04:21.267 --> 00:04:23.267
And hopefully
with all that information,

00:04:23.267 --> 00:04:25.801
and I'm sure a lot of you
have some great ideas out there,

00:04:25.801 --> 00:04:28.167
you can combine
with the things that we have--

00:04:28.167 --> 00:04:31.100
the technologies that we have--
together with your great ideas,

00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:37.033
and then you can go out
and make some money.

00:04:37.033 --> 00:04:39.300
One thing
I forgot to mention

00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:42.267
is that we have
a Google Moderator tool.

00:04:42.267 --> 00:04:45.734
So you can enter questions--

00:04:45.734 --> 00:04:48.334
Let me go back.
I forgot to mention that.

00:04:48.334 --> 00:04:50.534
At the bottom here,
that tiny URL,

00:04:50.534 --> 00:04:52.467
you can enter questions
during the session,

00:04:52.467 --> 00:04:55.334
and at the end
we'll take the questions,

00:04:55.334 --> 00:04:57.667
and you can also
vote on these questions.

00:04:57.667 --> 00:05:01.400
But I guess it's much more fun
to not keep your heads down,

00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:05.734
and let's talk about
numbers and dollars.

00:05:05.734 --> 00:05:08.667
Okay, so just imagine that
we want to start a business.

00:05:08.667 --> 00:05:11.868
Easy way is, like,
to set up a lemonade stand.

00:05:11.868 --> 00:05:14.200
We need to have
customers that'll pay us

00:05:14.200 --> 00:05:15.868
to generate revenue.

00:05:15.868 --> 00:05:17.968
and then there's
the associated cost.

00:05:17.968 --> 00:05:20.868
The difference between
revenue and cost is your profit.

00:05:20.868 --> 00:05:22.934
In doing a Web application,

00:05:22.934 --> 00:05:25.133
we're gonna cover
all these areas later.

00:05:25.133 --> 00:05:26.434
Revenue, cost...

00:05:26.434 --> 00:05:30.400
In doing your Web application,
one key problem we face,

00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:31.934
the key challenge is that,

00:05:31.934 --> 00:05:33.701
how do we get
all these customers, right?

00:05:33.701 --> 00:05:36.467
In a real
brick and mortar business,

00:05:36.467 --> 00:05:37.934
that's what you face.

00:05:37.934 --> 00:05:39.968
In a Web application
that's also the challenge

00:05:39.968 --> 00:05:41.300
that you typically face.

00:05:41.300 --> 00:05:42.501
How do we get customers?

00:05:42.501 --> 00:05:45.467
Well, imagine that we have
a lemonade stand.

00:05:45.467 --> 00:05:48.734
And if one day President Obama
shows up at your stand,

00:05:48.734 --> 00:05:51.968
you know how much traffic that's
gonna bring to your stand.

00:05:51.968 --> 00:05:54.868
All that foot traffic
would probably convert

00:05:54.868 --> 00:05:56.367
into some kind of sales.

00:05:56.367 --> 00:05:58.601
So one way to do this--
to get customers--

00:05:58.601 --> 00:06:02.467
is to take your lemonade stand
maybe to Mr. Obama.

00:06:02.467 --> 00:06:04.400
In our case, I'm gonna
touch on, you know,

00:06:04.400 --> 00:06:06.767
what is the thing
that is sort of equivalent

00:06:06.767 --> 00:06:09.400
to somebody with star power?

00:06:09.400 --> 00:06:11.434
The other disadvantage

00:06:11.434 --> 00:06:13.267
of a typical
brick and mortar business

00:06:13.267 --> 00:06:16.767
is that you have to do
the sales pitch over and over.

00:06:16.767 --> 00:06:19.400
And you also have to--
to make a real ongoing business

00:06:19.400 --> 00:06:21.234
you have to build
one stand at a time.

00:06:21.234 --> 00:06:23.234
You have one stand,
you have to keep doing it,

00:06:23.234 --> 00:06:26.267
and you'll scale it
up to 1,000 stands.

00:06:26.267 --> 00:06:28.968
You know, after all,
you have to deliver real goods.

00:06:28.968 --> 00:06:31.234
You have to sell
real lemonade.

00:06:31.234 --> 00:06:33.734
Is there a better
mouse trap out there?

00:06:33.734 --> 00:06:35.200
That's what we're
trying to propose.

00:06:35.200 --> 00:06:36.567
Social applications.

00:06:36.567 --> 00:06:39.000
Take your Web application
and move into social arena,

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:40.834
and you have
a much better mouse trap.

00:06:40.834 --> 00:06:44.734
So here's a picture
you see...

00:06:44.734 --> 00:06:48.067
That ring of people
represents social networks.

00:06:48.067 --> 00:06:50.634
In the middle there
is the OpenSocial technology.

00:06:50.634 --> 00:06:52.868
So if you take
your Web application

00:06:52.868 --> 00:06:55.934
to a social arena
with social networks,

00:06:55.934 --> 00:06:58.567
what you gain
is millions of users,

00:06:58.567 --> 00:07:00.901
and those users,
they also have their friends,

00:07:00.901 --> 00:07:02.667
so you have the friend raft.

00:07:02.667 --> 00:07:04.367
What they'll do
for you is that

00:07:04.367 --> 00:07:07.734
they'll use the inherent
communication channels

00:07:07.734 --> 00:07:09.801
afforded by
the social networks,

00:07:09.801 --> 00:07:11.234
and inside your application,

00:07:11.234 --> 00:07:13.701
as they play and be engaged
with the application,

00:07:13.701 --> 00:07:16.767
they're gonna basically
spread the words for you.

00:07:16.767 --> 00:07:18.067
So in doing that,
you don't have to

00:07:18.067 --> 00:07:20.467
do the sales pitch yourself
over and over.

00:07:20.467 --> 00:07:23.934
And also we have open
technologies like OpenSocial

00:07:23.934 --> 00:07:26.734
that allows you
to build your application

00:07:26.734 --> 00:07:28.734
against one
social network.

00:07:28.734 --> 00:07:30.601
And then you can
pretty much

00:07:30.601 --> 00:07:33.100
just build it once
and use it everywhere.

00:07:33.100 --> 00:07:35.667
Deploy it to multiple
social networks.

00:07:35.667 --> 00:07:37.767
We have some
great applications

00:07:37.767 --> 00:07:41.534
that are running
on two-dozen social networks.

00:07:41.534 --> 00:07:45.167
And we also have--
which is not covered here--

00:07:45.167 --> 00:07:47.567
technology like
Google App Engine

00:07:47.567 --> 00:07:49.767
that allows you
to scale the back end

00:07:49.767 --> 00:07:52.767
from one server
to potentially 1,000 servers

00:07:52.767 --> 00:07:54.801
if you have
millions of hits every day.

00:07:54.801 --> 00:07:56.634
And these are the things
that help you

00:07:56.634 --> 00:07:59.167
to grow your business
really fast.

00:07:59.167 --> 00:08:02.968
With that I'm gonna turn to
Chewy, who's gonna cover the--

00:08:02.968 --> 00:08:04.701
do a quick survey
of the landscape

00:08:04.701 --> 00:08:05.901
of social applications.

00:08:05.901 --> 00:08:08.167
Trewhella: Thanks, Shawn.

00:08:08.167 --> 00:08:09.167
[mic thumps]

00:08:09.167 --> 00:08:10.434
Ah, there we go.

00:08:10.434 --> 00:08:12.400
Hello, everyone.
I'm Chewy. I'm from the UK.

00:08:12.400 --> 00:08:13.901
I get very excited
when I talk,

00:08:13.901 --> 00:08:16.434
and I'll probably end up
speaking very, very quickly,

00:08:16.434 --> 00:08:17.901
so if I'm going
too quickly for anyone,

00:08:17.901 --> 00:08:19.400
just throw something at me.

00:08:19.400 --> 00:08:21.701
I'll dodge it, and that's my cue
to slow down a little bit.

00:08:21.701 --> 00:08:25.601
We're gonna talk a little bit
about some of the areas

00:08:25.601 --> 00:08:27.367
you can work on
in OpenSocial.

00:08:27.367 --> 00:08:28.934
One of the cool things
about OpenSocial

00:08:28.934 --> 00:08:31.634
is you can build an application,
and with the same bit of code,

00:08:31.634 --> 00:08:33.367
or at least a very
similar piece of code,

00:08:33.367 --> 00:08:36.200
you can deploy it
to multiple social networks.

00:08:36.200 --> 00:08:37.200
So whatever application
you're building,

00:08:37.200 --> 00:08:38.501
you can get it out,

00:08:38.501 --> 00:08:40.601
you can get it to a number
of different people.

00:08:40.601 --> 00:08:42.801
If you have a look
at opensocial.org

00:08:42.801 --> 00:08:44.367
there's a list
of all the social networks

00:08:44.367 --> 00:08:46.534
that are currently
supported.

00:08:46.534 --> 00:08:48.601
And here's a list
of some of them.

00:08:48.601 --> 00:08:51.100
Myspace, Orkut, LinkedIn,
and obviously there's Facebook.

00:08:51.100 --> 00:08:52.434
They're not OpenSocial,

00:08:52.434 --> 00:08:54.133
but they're a kind of
the elephant in the room

00:08:54.133 --> 00:08:55.701
as far as OpenSocial
are concerned.

00:08:55.701 --> 00:08:56.801
If you're thinking about

00:08:56.801 --> 00:08:58.000
building an OpenSocial
application,

00:08:58.000 --> 00:08:59.467
you really have to
look at them.

00:08:59.467 --> 00:09:03.901
They've got so many users,
it would be rude not to, right?

00:09:03.901 --> 00:09:06.868
The Facebook Developer Platform
is obviously pretty robust.

00:09:06.868 --> 00:09:08.200
They developed
their own language,

00:09:08.200 --> 00:09:09.567
but the thinking
was with OpenSocial,

00:09:09.567 --> 00:09:12.133
rather than every platform
develop their own language,

00:09:12.133 --> 00:09:13.234
and leave developers going,

00:09:13.234 --> 00:09:15.300
"Oh, which platform
do I develop for?"

00:09:15.300 --> 00:09:17.834
We created
a standardized language,

00:09:17.834 --> 00:09:20.033
which we then handed out
to a foundation,

00:09:20.033 --> 00:09:22.100
the OpenSocial Foundation,
which has standardized this

00:09:22.100 --> 00:09:26.100
for use across any network
which would like to support it.

00:09:26.100 --> 00:09:27.567
There are a bunch of app
developers out there too

00:09:27.567 --> 00:09:30.367
who are building
OpenSocial applications

00:09:30.367 --> 00:09:32.334
and Facebook applications
right now.

00:09:32.334 --> 00:09:33.434
I don't know if you guys

00:09:33.434 --> 00:09:35.067
attended the Fireside Chat
yesterday.

00:09:35.067 --> 00:09:38.501
I didn't, but I heard that the
hot topic was virtual currency.

00:09:38.501 --> 00:09:40.634
It seems like users
on social networks

00:09:40.634 --> 00:09:42.334
are pretty happy
to use virtual currency

00:09:42.334 --> 00:09:46.667
but Gerardo's gonna talk a bit
more about that in his section.

00:09:46.667 --> 00:09:48.901
You also want to think
about payment providers.

00:09:48.901 --> 00:09:51.100
If you're not gonna be using
the built-in virtual currency

00:09:51.100 --> 00:09:53.801
you're gonna need to work out
a transaction somehow.

00:09:53.801 --> 00:09:55.868
Unless you're happy to set up
your own banking and merchant

00:09:55.868 --> 00:09:56.868
and payment
and clearance system,

00:09:56.868 --> 00:09:58.334
which you're probably not,

00:09:58.334 --> 00:10:00.367
you're gonna want to be looking
at an existing provider.

00:10:00.367 --> 00:10:03.234
It could be PayPal,
it could be Google Checkout,

00:10:03.234 --> 00:10:05.133
it might be a little bit
more integration

00:10:05.133 --> 00:10:07.534
with something
like DataCash or Netpay

00:10:07.534 --> 00:10:09.701
or any of the guys
that you can see here.

00:10:09.701 --> 00:10:11.167
And then you're gonna
want to look at tools

00:10:11.167 --> 00:10:14.434
to measure the success
of your application.

00:10:14.434 --> 00:10:16.567
Again, you might want
to use some free tools.

00:10:16.567 --> 00:10:18.734
We've got Website Optimizer
and Google Analytics,

00:10:18.734 --> 00:10:20.300
which will let you do
a certain amount

00:10:20.300 --> 00:10:22.701
of monitoring
and testing for free.

00:10:22.701 --> 00:10:24.567
But there are
paid for applications,

00:10:24.567 --> 00:10:28.667
which may deliver more
or better results for you.

00:10:28.667 --> 00:10:30.200
So these are things you want
to be thinking about too.

00:10:30.200 --> 00:10:31.868
Now, which application
should you build?

00:10:31.868 --> 00:10:34.200
I guess that's
the biggest question.

00:10:34.200 --> 00:10:37.801
This is the eCPM for different
types of applications.

00:10:37.801 --> 00:10:39.400
Gerardo's gonna
talk a little more

00:10:39.400 --> 00:10:40.767
about exactly
how that's calculated,

00:10:40.767 --> 00:10:43.334
but it's essentially
the cost per thousand views

00:10:43.334 --> 00:10:45.234
if you're just running
an AdSense-type model.

00:10:45.234 --> 00:10:48.868
You can see that card games
are probably the most valuable,

00:10:48.868 --> 00:10:50.400
Followed quickly by MMOs.

00:10:50.400 --> 00:10:53.567
I guess &lt;i&gt;Warcraft&lt;/i&gt; has really
helped drive awareness of those.

00:10:53.567 --> 00:10:54.834
And it goes down and down,

00:10:54.834 --> 00:10:57.601
so if you want to make
a racing game versus pets,

00:10:57.601 --> 00:11:01.167
or a green application, or just
something that's information,

00:11:01.167 --> 00:11:03.100
they're gonna be worth less,
but the maintenance,

00:11:03.100 --> 00:11:05.067
the security,
the work you're gonna have to do

00:11:05.067 --> 00:11:07.300
is less in conjunction
with that.

00:11:07.300 --> 00:11:08.834
You know, think about
building a poker game.

00:11:08.834 --> 00:11:11.200
The first thing people are gonna
do is try and cheat that system.

00:11:11.200 --> 00:11:12.367
They're gonna
try and break it,

00:11:12.367 --> 00:11:13.400
they're gonna try
and get the high score,

00:11:13.400 --> 00:11:14.534
they're gonna try
and get payouts

00:11:14.534 --> 00:11:16.267
where they don't
necessarily want them.

00:11:16.267 --> 00:11:19.734
Whereas if you're just providing
a customized news feed,

00:11:19.734 --> 00:11:22.501
people aren't really motivated
to try and hack that to death.

00:11:22.501 --> 00:11:24.033
You might still get people
trying to take it apart,

00:11:24.033 --> 00:11:26.767
but it's not gonna be
as serious if it breaks.

00:11:26.767 --> 00:11:30.234
So it gives you an idea
of where to focus.

00:11:30.234 --> 00:11:32.901
Gerardo's gonna have a look
at this Mouse Hunt app

00:11:32.901 --> 00:11:34.100
in a bit more detail
and talk

00:11:34.100 --> 00:11:36.801
about things like
what can be bought,

00:11:36.801 --> 00:11:39.300
do people pay real dollars,
and how to implement.

00:11:39.300 --> 00:11:41.000
But I just wanted to give
a quick overview.

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:42.400
There's a Mouse Hunt game
that's available,

00:11:42.400 --> 00:11:45.267
and the idea is you're
a mouse hunter for a kingdom,

00:11:45.267 --> 00:11:46.968
and you've just
got to catch mice.

00:11:46.968 --> 00:11:48.667
And you use different cheese
to bait them,

00:11:48.667 --> 00:11:51.934
and the goal is to be the best
mouse catcher in the kingdom

00:11:51.934 --> 00:11:54.567
and get to the top
of the high score charts.

00:11:54.567 --> 00:11:56.267
So in order to answer
some of those questions,

00:11:56.267 --> 00:12:00.267
here's Gerardo.

00:12:00.267 --> 00:12:03.334
Capiel: Thank you.
All right.

00:12:03.334 --> 00:12:07.968
Let's talk about making money
with OpenSocial.

00:12:07.968 --> 00:12:11.100
So there's a bunch of different
avenues that you can take

00:12:11.100 --> 00:12:14.767
to generate revenues
from your social application.

00:12:14.767 --> 00:12:18.701
You can do advertising,
you can build a virtual economy,

00:12:18.701 --> 00:12:20.033
you can build branded apps,

00:12:20.033 --> 00:12:21.968
and then there's
a number of other techniques

00:12:21.968 --> 00:12:23.734
that I'll dive into.

00:12:23.734 --> 00:12:25.067
So let's talk
about advertising,

00:12:25.067 --> 00:12:26.801
which is probably
the best-known technique,

00:12:26.801 --> 00:12:28.334
probably
the oldest technique

00:12:28.334 --> 00:12:31.367
with making money
on social applications.

00:12:31.367 --> 00:12:35.067
So for advertising you can run
either display or text link ads

00:12:35.067 --> 00:12:39.901
and then charge for those on
a CPM basis, CPI, or CPA basis.

00:12:39.901 --> 00:12:42.501
One of the more
popular ways

00:12:42.501 --> 00:12:45.934
of making money
with social applications today

00:12:45.934 --> 00:12:49.968
is actually advertising other
peoples' social applications.

00:12:49.968 --> 00:12:53.267
And in that type of case,

00:12:53.267 --> 00:12:55.734
you tend to get paid
on a cost per install,

00:12:55.734 --> 00:12:57.934
so some other
application provider

00:12:57.934 --> 00:13:00.067
that wants to promote
their application

00:13:00.067 --> 00:13:02.200
that knows
that your user base

00:13:02.200 --> 00:13:04.601
is obviously
application users--

00:13:04.601 --> 00:13:06.567
a very nicely
targeted base--

00:13:06.567 --> 00:13:09.434
is gonna pay you on a cost
per install, and that ranges--

00:13:09.434 --> 00:13:12.367
you know, it could be
as low as 75¢

00:13:12.367 --> 00:13:16.167
all the way up to,
let's say, $2.

00:13:16.167 --> 00:13:19.267
So implementing advertising
is also the easiest thing to do

00:13:19.267 --> 00:13:23.200
in terms of generating revenue
with your social application.

00:13:23.200 --> 00:13:28.767
It's simply cutting and pasting
some JavaScript code

00:13:28.767 --> 00:13:30.133
in either case here.

00:13:30.133 --> 00:13:33.968
So pretty easy
to implement.

00:13:33.968 --> 00:13:38.767
So it's easy,
but there are challenges.

00:13:38.767 --> 00:13:40.167
Can't--if it was--

00:13:40.167 --> 00:13:45.000
And one of the challenges is
that eCPMs have been declining.

00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:47.334
That is a function
of the economy,

00:13:47.334 --> 00:13:48.801
where there's less demand,

00:13:48.801 --> 00:13:50.167
it's also
a function of supply,

00:13:50.167 --> 00:13:52.267
so there are a lot
of social applications

00:13:52.267 --> 00:13:54.934
out there right now,
a lot of inventory.

00:13:54.934 --> 00:13:58.200
So it's harder today
than it used to be

00:13:58.200 --> 00:14:00.601
to actually monetize
your application

00:14:00.601 --> 00:14:02.133
purely through advertising,

00:14:02.133 --> 00:14:04.367
and a lot of the successful
companies in this base--

00:14:04.367 --> 00:14:07.334
advertising is only
a small fraction

00:14:07.334 --> 00:14:10.367
of their total revenue.

00:14:10.367 --> 00:14:12.868
But, that said,
the key to it

00:14:12.868 --> 00:14:15.534
is to be contextually
relevant with your ads.

00:14:15.534 --> 00:14:19.868
So if you're developing
an application around music,

00:14:19.868 --> 00:14:23.167
then you should be focusing
on ads around ring tones,

00:14:23.167 --> 00:14:24.934
which tend to pay
pretty well,

00:14:24.934 --> 00:14:28.968
music downloads,
and concert tickets.

00:14:28.968 --> 00:14:32.868
All right, so let's shift to
a different way to make money,

00:14:32.868 --> 00:14:35.901
which is by creating a virtual
economy with your game,

00:14:35.901 --> 00:14:37.834
and this is
actually probably

00:14:37.834 --> 00:14:40.701
one of the hottest
areas right now.

00:14:40.701 --> 00:14:42.601
It's a space, it's about
a year and a half old,

00:14:42.601 --> 00:14:46.267
but there are companies
that are already building,

00:14:46.267 --> 00:14:48.868
rumors are, 100 million-dollar
businesses a year

00:14:48.868 --> 00:14:51.934
based on, primarily,
virtual economies.

00:14:51.934 --> 00:14:54.234
And to illustrate this,

00:14:54.234 --> 00:14:57.100
let's talk about
this Mouse Hunt app game,

00:14:57.100 --> 00:14:59.200
where your goal
is to catch mice.

00:14:59.200 --> 00:15:01.434
And you can catch mice

00:15:01.434 --> 00:15:05.267
by actually having
cheese and traps.

00:15:05.267 --> 00:15:08.467
But you got to buy the cheese
and traps to catch the mice.

00:15:08.467 --> 00:15:10.300
And you do that
through a virtual currency

00:15:10.300 --> 00:15:13.667
that they--let's just
generically call it gold.

00:15:13.667 --> 00:15:16.100
So to get gold--

00:15:16.100 --> 00:15:19.934
you can actually do things
in the game to get gold,

00:15:19.934 --> 00:15:21.400
but if you want
to go the fast way,

00:15:21.400 --> 00:15:22.567
which is what happens

00:15:22.567 --> 00:15:25.267
with a large enough
percentage of people,

00:15:25.267 --> 00:15:27.133
you can buy the gold.

00:15:27.133 --> 00:15:32.834
So buying the gold is enabled
through a payment provider.

00:15:32.834 --> 00:15:35.901
PayPal is a very common
payment provider,

00:15:35.901 --> 00:15:39.868
but there are about a dozen
that I can probably name

00:15:39.868 --> 00:15:41.200
off of the top of my head

00:15:41.200 --> 00:15:43.334
in terms of payment providers
that are out there.

00:15:43.334 --> 00:15:44.734
And in this case
they're just taking

00:15:44.734 --> 00:15:46.567
direct payments
through a credit card.

00:15:46.567 --> 00:15:48.834
There are some providers
that actually allow you

00:15:48.834 --> 00:15:53.100
to bill--to charge your users
using a mobile phone,

00:15:53.100 --> 00:15:56.234
using premium SNS,
but primarily credit card

00:15:56.234 --> 00:15:58.734
is the main form
of direct payment,

00:15:58.734 --> 00:16:01.901
and like I said,
PayPal is a big provider.

00:16:01.901 --> 00:16:04.167
And here what you're seeing
from a revenue standpoint

00:16:04.167 --> 00:16:09.767
is anywhere from $1 to $10
per daily active user.

00:16:13.234 --> 00:16:16.968
So let's say your users don't
want to pay with a credit card.

00:16:16.968 --> 00:16:19.834
Well, there are other ways that
you can actually monetize these,

00:16:19.834 --> 00:16:22.901
and using virtual currency.

00:16:22.901 --> 00:16:24.167
And this is kind of a hybrid

00:16:24.167 --> 00:16:26.834
between advertising
and direct payment.

00:16:26.834 --> 00:16:30.133
And here what you're doing
is you're actually

00:16:30.133 --> 00:16:33.300
giving gold to users
when they fill out offers.

00:16:33.300 --> 00:16:36.467
and who you're gonna get paid by
is the offer provider.

00:16:36.467 --> 00:16:39.934
So it could be like Netflix
that's actually gonna pay you--

00:16:39.934 --> 00:16:41.367
let's say--I'm just
gonna pick a number,

00:16:41.367 --> 00:16:43.100
this is not actually
a realistic number--

00:16:43.100 --> 00:16:46.601
but let's say they'll
pay you $30 for every user

00:16:46.601 --> 00:16:48.567
that you get
to fill out an offer

00:16:48.567 --> 00:16:50.801
and sign up
for a Netflix subscription.

00:16:50.801 --> 00:16:54.534
And so here
the way this works

00:16:54.534 --> 00:16:58.567
is when a user wants
to get some gold,

00:16:58.567 --> 00:17:00.501
they are presented
with a set of offers,

00:17:00.501 --> 00:17:02.767
they choose which offer
they want to pick--

00:17:02.767 --> 00:17:05.901
there are numerous providers
in the offer space--

00:17:05.901 --> 00:17:07.300
they fill out the offer,

00:17:07.300 --> 00:17:09.701
and then the offer provider
pays you,

00:17:09.701 --> 00:17:13.534
and actually you give
the user the currency.

00:17:13.534 --> 00:17:15.868
And so one company
in this space, for example,

00:17:15.868 --> 00:17:19.467
is OfferPal that provides
this type of functionality,

00:17:19.467 --> 00:17:25.467
here the average revenue
per 100 DAUs is about $7.50.

00:17:25.467 --> 00:17:30.267
So it's a pretty
lucrative area as well.

00:17:30.267 --> 00:17:32.968
Implementation is just
a little bit harder.

00:17:32.968 --> 00:17:34.701
obviously you've got
to build a whole concept

00:17:34.701 --> 00:17:37.734
of virtual currency
into your application.

00:17:37.734 --> 00:17:41.734
But to integrate
the payment providers

00:17:41.734 --> 00:17:43.234
is pretty easy.

00:17:43.234 --> 00:17:47.701
You're essentially gonna bring
an iframe into your application

00:17:47.701 --> 00:17:50.467
that's bringing in all the
offers from the offer provider,

00:17:50.467 --> 00:17:51.901
in this case OfferPal,

00:17:51.901 --> 00:17:54.133
and then you're gonna
implement on your server

00:17:54.133 --> 00:17:58.567
some code to actually
handle a callback

00:17:58.567 --> 00:18:00.567
that OfferPal
is gonna do to tell you

00:18:00.567 --> 00:18:03.567
that the transaction
was completed, who it was,

00:18:03.567 --> 00:18:06.400
and how much currency you should
be giving to that person.

00:18:06.400 --> 00:18:08.834
So pretty easy
in terms of implementation.

00:18:08.834 --> 00:18:11.367
Probably the hardest part
is to figure out

00:18:11.367 --> 00:18:15.467
how to create that
virtual economy in your game.

00:18:15.467 --> 00:18:18.868
So let's talk about
a third way to make money,

00:18:18.868 --> 00:18:21.801
which is by creating
branded applications.

00:18:21.801 --> 00:18:24.033
Now this approach
is not--

00:18:24.033 --> 00:18:27.234
We haven't seen it
as much here in the U.S.,

00:18:27.234 --> 00:18:29.167
but it's pretty popular,

00:18:29.167 --> 00:18:32.200
particularly in Europe
and in Asia,

00:18:32.200 --> 00:18:34.968
and some examples of brands
that have been involved in this

00:18:34.968 --> 00:18:37.968
are Coke, Sony Ericsson,
Heineken.

00:18:37.968 --> 00:18:40.300
I'm gonna show you
a few examples here.

00:18:40.300 --> 00:18:43.801
One great example
is FooPets,

00:18:43.801 --> 00:18:47.534
where they actually
integrated a dog food brand

00:18:47.534 --> 00:18:49.100
very nicely into the game

00:18:49.100 --> 00:18:53.000
so the users don't feel like
they're really being hard sold.

00:18:53.000 --> 00:18:54.167
So here's an example--

00:18:54.167 --> 00:18:59.968
an application
that is featuring Coca Cola.

00:18:59.968 --> 00:19:02.767
Coke sponsored
this application.

00:19:02.767 --> 00:19:05.834
The application includes
ways to share and send

00:19:05.834 --> 00:19:09.200
virtual colas to your friends,
or weekly prizes,

00:19:09.200 --> 00:19:10.567
there's an area for users

00:19:10.567 --> 00:19:14.133
to submit input
and write their own stories.

00:19:14.133 --> 00:19:16.667
Here's the FooPets example,

00:19:16.667 --> 00:19:19.367
where, you know,
you can buy your pet some food.

00:19:19.367 --> 00:19:22.534
and you're gonna buy them
Purina Puppy Chow food.

00:19:22.534 --> 00:19:27.067
So very subtly integrated--
or not so subtle--into the game.

00:19:27.067 --> 00:19:29.234
Appssavvy is a company
that's out there

00:19:29.234 --> 00:19:32.067
that if you were a developer
or you're a brand,

00:19:32.067 --> 00:19:35.968
they can connect developers
and brands together.

00:19:35.968 --> 00:19:41.667
So those are kind of the three
probably most popular one--

00:19:41.667 --> 00:19:43.100
methods of making money.

00:19:43.100 --> 00:19:46.601
There's a few other techniques
that are out there.

00:19:46.601 --> 00:19:48.000
One is to create an app

00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:50.634
where it's free to use
in the beginning.

00:19:50.634 --> 00:19:52.667
Like, for example, Box.net.

00:19:52.667 --> 00:19:56.968
But as you start to require
more storage, let's say,

00:19:56.968 --> 00:19:59.167
in this application
where you're storing files,

00:19:59.167 --> 00:20:00.934
they're gonna
charge you for that,

00:20:00.934 --> 00:20:03.534
so it's a premium
model here.

00:20:03.534 --> 00:20:07.834
There's also donation
type of revenue models,

00:20:07.834 --> 00:20:12.601
where essentially people
are donating money to a cause.

00:20:12.601 --> 00:20:14.534
A cause is a very
popular example.

00:20:14.534 --> 00:20:17.968
You can also make money
by building custom applications

00:20:17.968 --> 00:20:19.934
for other companies.

00:20:19.934 --> 00:20:21.834
And then the last
way here--

00:20:21.834 --> 00:20:24.601
and this is really
in the early phases of this,

00:20:24.601 --> 00:20:27.834
but we are seeing
some third party applications

00:20:27.834 --> 00:20:31.200
developing special relationships
with social networks

00:20:31.200 --> 00:20:33.667
and then getting
featured placement,

00:20:33.667 --> 00:20:36.601
and in return
they're doing revenue share

00:20:36.601 --> 00:20:38.834
with those companies.

00:20:38.834 --> 00:20:41.367
It's kind of a long shot
probably for most companies,

00:20:41.367 --> 00:20:43.634
but it does exist
out there

00:20:43.634 --> 00:20:44.968
for companies
that have something

00:20:44.968 --> 00:20:47.267
really compelling
for a social network.

00:20:47.267 --> 00:20:49.968
that they want to
integrate in.

00:20:49.968 --> 00:20:51.300
So with that,

00:20:51.300 --> 00:20:55.234
let me turn it back to Chewy
to talk about cost.

00:20:55.234 --> 00:20:56.734
Trewhella:
Are we on? Yay. Okay.

00:20:56.734 --> 00:20:59.701
So how many people
have run their own business

00:20:59.701 --> 00:21:01.200
at one time or another?

00:21:01.200 --> 00:21:04.934
I have; before I was at Google,
I ran quite a lot of businesses

00:21:04.934 --> 00:21:07.334
or worked
at small companies.

00:21:07.334 --> 00:21:08.868
Obviously none of them
hugely successful

00:21:08.868 --> 00:21:10.334
or I'd be on a yacht
in the Caribbean

00:21:10.334 --> 00:21:12.033
as opposed to onstage
talking to you.

00:21:12.033 --> 00:21:13.167
But one of the things

00:21:13.167 --> 00:21:15.868
that almost always
tripped me up was cost.

00:21:15.868 --> 00:21:18.968
It's something you've got to
keep in the back of your mind.

00:21:18.968 --> 00:21:21.100
Cost is broadly broken up
into five areas,

00:21:21.100 --> 00:21:23.434
at least for the purpose
of this presentation.

00:21:23.434 --> 00:21:24.734
We've got development,
so actually, you know,

00:21:24.734 --> 00:21:25.868
building the thing,

00:21:25.868 --> 00:21:29.100
getting people into code
and design stuff.

00:21:29.100 --> 00:21:30.434
Hosting and operations.

00:21:30.434 --> 00:21:31.901
Where does the thing live,
what does it live on?

00:21:31.901 --> 00:21:33.067
Shawn's talked
a little bit about that,

00:21:33.067 --> 00:21:35.100
but I'm gonna go
into some more detail.

00:21:35.100 --> 00:21:37.534
You've got marketing
and advertising costs.

00:21:37.534 --> 00:21:39.501
I'd love to be able to say
that you're gonna get

00:21:39.501 --> 00:21:42.000
a bajillion users and make
a bajillion dollars

00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:43.968
without spending
a penny on--

00:21:43.968 --> 00:21:48.501
or I guess a cent on making
people aware of your app,

00:21:48.501 --> 00:21:49.968
but that's not really
the case anymore.

00:21:49.968 --> 00:21:52.200
You are gonna have to invest
something into that.

00:21:52.200 --> 00:21:53.200
Community management.

00:21:53.200 --> 00:21:54.367
Once you get
a bunch of users,

00:21:54.367 --> 00:21:56.501
you're gonna need
to support those users.

00:21:56.501 --> 00:21:58.534
There are some ways you can
save cash around doing that,

00:21:58.534 --> 00:21:59.567
and we'll have a look
at those too.

00:21:59.567 --> 00:22:00.801
And then finally others.

00:22:00.801 --> 00:22:02.100
I guess one of
the most important in there

00:22:02.100 --> 00:22:03.767
is, like, legal and office.

00:22:03.767 --> 00:22:05.300
And we'll talk about
some of those too.

00:22:05.300 --> 00:22:07.100
So first of all,
development.

00:22:07.100 --> 00:22:08.567
I'm guessing,
or at least I'm hoping

00:22:08.567 --> 00:22:09.834
everyone's hand'll go up
when I say this.

00:22:09.834 --> 00:22:11.501
How many developers
are in the room?

00:22:11.501 --> 00:22:14.367
Yeah, okay, how many
non-developers in the room?

00:22:14.367 --> 00:22:15.968
Okay, a few.

00:22:15.968 --> 00:22:18.367
That's all right.
We won't bite.

00:22:18.367 --> 00:22:21.167
But as a developer you've
probably worn many, many hats.

00:22:21.167 --> 00:22:22.601
You've probably
been a developer,

00:22:22.601 --> 00:22:24.367
you may at one time or another
have tried to design stuff.

00:22:24.367 --> 00:22:25.767
If you're anything like me,

00:22:25.767 --> 00:22:28.734
you'll have realized
very quickly that you can't.

00:22:28.734 --> 00:22:30.534
It's funny,
I know more designers

00:22:30.534 --> 00:22:32.267
who can do a bit of code
than coders

00:22:32.267 --> 00:22:33.501
who can do
a bit of design.

00:22:33.501 --> 00:22:35.667
Maybe that's just
my group of friends.

00:22:35.667 --> 00:22:37.234
But when you're
developing this product,

00:22:37.234 --> 00:22:40.701
it may be a simple app
that only requires you.

00:22:40.701 --> 00:22:41.968
And you may just
need some icons

00:22:41.968 --> 00:22:44.033
that you can source
from creative commons,

00:22:44.033 --> 00:22:47.267
and use Microsoft Paint
to knock up

00:22:47.267 --> 00:22:49.300
some basic graphics and convert
into pngs or whatever,

00:22:49.300 --> 00:22:50.601
but chances are
you're gonna need

00:22:50.601 --> 00:22:52.334
to invest in a designer
at some point.

00:22:52.334 --> 00:22:53.701
And also,
once your team grows,

00:22:53.701 --> 00:22:55.167
if it becomes a really
big application,

00:22:55.167 --> 00:22:58.167
you're gonna need someone
to manage these costs.

00:22:58.167 --> 00:22:59.968
Now with development
of any code--

00:22:59.968 --> 00:23:02.067
I was having a chat with
a couple of people last night,

00:23:02.067 --> 00:23:04.234
and we were saying
there's an 80-20-80 rule.

00:23:04.234 --> 00:23:05.501
I don't know how many
of you have heard this.

00:23:05.501 --> 00:23:06.801
You probably know it

00:23:06.801 --> 00:23:08.501
even if you haven't heard it
explained like this.

00:23:08.501 --> 00:23:10.334
And it's the idea
that 80% of the development

00:23:10.334 --> 00:23:12.367
will take 80%
of the time,

00:23:12.367 --> 00:23:15.701
and the last 20% will take
another 80% of the time.

00:23:15.701 --> 00:23:18.167
Because you're, you know,
you get nearly there,

00:23:18.167 --> 00:23:19.267
and then you're like,
"Oh, what if we just moved that?

00:23:19.267 --> 00:23:20.501
"And hey, that bit
doesn't work.

00:23:20.501 --> 00:23:22.400
And oh, we just need
to change that around."

00:23:22.400 --> 00:23:25.634
Feature creep--what if we
added this element?

00:23:25.634 --> 00:23:27.501
So think about that too.

00:23:27.501 --> 00:23:31.167
But one of the things also
to think about is iterate often.

00:23:31.167 --> 00:23:32.601
At Google we roll stuff out.

00:23:32.601 --> 00:23:34.701
It's why we have the beta tag
on so many products.

00:23:34.701 --> 00:23:36.000
But we want to get
stuff out there,

00:23:36.000 --> 00:23:38.200
and we want to see
how people are using it.

00:23:38.200 --> 00:23:39.968
And I've seen
big organizations

00:23:39.968 --> 00:23:41.734
that I've talked to
crippled by meetings.

00:23:41.734 --> 00:23:43.734
They want to get
everything perfect,

00:23:43.734 --> 00:23:46.167
so they wait a year and a half
before launching something,

00:23:46.167 --> 00:23:48.000
by which time it's
kind of obsolete anyway,

00:23:48.000 --> 00:23:49.100
especially on the Internet,

00:23:49.100 --> 00:23:51.300
and especially
in social networking.

00:23:51.300 --> 00:23:53.400
So think about creating
a small feature set

00:23:53.400 --> 00:23:56.167
that solves a real problem,
get it out the door quickly,

00:23:56.167 --> 00:23:59.667
see what users think, and then
iterate, fix it, update.

00:23:59.667 --> 00:24:03.567
Here's an example
of an application from iGoogle.

00:24:03.567 --> 00:24:07.000
It just shows a really nice way
to solve a user problem.

00:24:07.000 --> 00:24:08.901
All of you have probably
at one time or another

00:24:08.901 --> 00:24:11.534
needed to search
online for travel.

00:24:11.534 --> 00:24:13.434
If you just know that you
want to visit a friend--

00:24:13.434 --> 00:24:15.334
Let's say
I'm in San Francisco

00:24:15.334 --> 00:24:16.667
and I've got a friend
in L.A.,

00:24:16.667 --> 00:24:18.934
and I want to visit them
sometime in June.

00:24:18.934 --> 00:24:22.100
I don't necessarily
want to search 34 or 30 times--

00:24:22.100 --> 00:24:25.000
31 times for all
the different days

00:24:25.000 --> 00:24:26.968
to find
the cheapest flight.

00:24:26.968 --> 00:24:28.767
I install this gadget,
and I say I want to travel

00:24:28.767 --> 00:24:30.334
from here to here
in this month--Save.

00:24:30.334 --> 00:24:31.767
And then I don't know
if you can see it,

00:24:31.767 --> 00:24:34.033
but the cheapest flights
are outlined in yellow.

00:24:34.033 --> 00:24:36.200
And every time I come back
or reload this page,

00:24:36.200 --> 00:24:37.934
that's gonna do
a real-time search

00:24:37.934 --> 00:24:39.634
and show
the cheapest dates.

00:24:39.634 --> 00:24:41.467
And so instead of me
having to, you know,

00:24:41.467 --> 00:24:42.601
go and do these
searches every day

00:24:42.601 --> 00:24:43.767
or subscribe
to something,

00:24:43.767 --> 00:24:46.400
I just stick this gadget
on my homepage

00:24:46.400 --> 00:24:47.968
and it's giving me
the information I want.

00:24:47.968 --> 00:24:49.701
It's kind of like
a personal search agent,

00:24:49.701 --> 00:24:51.767
if that's what you want
to think about.

00:24:51.767 --> 00:24:53.934
This doesn't necessarily
make a lot of sense socially,

00:24:53.934 --> 00:24:55.501
but these are the sort of things
you want to be thinking about.

00:24:55.501 --> 00:24:56.734
Does this solve user need?

00:24:56.734 --> 00:24:58.400
Does this do something
users are gonna

00:24:58.400 --> 00:25:01.767
find useful
and want to engage with?

00:25:01.767 --> 00:25:03.934
Next, hosting
and operations.

00:25:03.934 --> 00:25:06.501
Does everyone know
what "LAMP" stands for?

00:25:06.501 --> 00:25:07.601
Okay, a few don't.

00:25:07.601 --> 00:25:10.734
It's Linux, Apache,
MySQL, and PHP.

00:25:10.734 --> 00:25:13.400
It's just a name for a kind of
server with some software on it.

00:25:13.400 --> 00:25:16.200
It could be Windows, IIS,
SQL Server, and .Net,

00:25:16.200 --> 00:25:18.834
but WISN is probably
not as easy to say.

00:25:18.834 --> 00:25:21.000
I mean, it could be Linux,
Apache, Postgres, and JSP,

00:25:21.000 --> 00:25:23.434
but again, LAPJ doesn't really
make a lot of sense.

00:25:23.434 --> 00:25:25.100
The point is it's
having some servers

00:25:25.100 --> 00:25:26.968
with some software on
that you manage.

00:25:26.968 --> 00:25:28.968
Either you own those servers
or you're leasing them

00:25:28.968 --> 00:25:30.901
in a data center somewhere.

00:25:30.901 --> 00:25:33.300
And that's gonna have
a cost associated with it.

00:25:33.300 --> 00:25:35.534
Not only the cost of actually
hiring the hardware,

00:25:35.534 --> 00:25:37.501
but then you're gonna need
sys admin skills.

00:25:37.501 --> 00:25:38.667
You're gonna need
to make sure

00:25:38.667 --> 00:25:40.200
that your server software
is patched.

00:25:40.200 --> 00:25:41.868
I don't know how many of you
went to Matt Cutts's talk

00:25:41.868 --> 00:25:44.734
about building
a good Web site,

00:25:44.734 --> 00:25:46.100
but one of the points
he made was, you know,

00:25:46.100 --> 00:25:47.567
Web sites now--it's PCs.

00:25:47.567 --> 00:25:49.801
Home PCs become more secure
as people switch to Apple,

00:25:49.801 --> 00:25:51.033
as Windows 7 rolls out,

00:25:51.033 --> 00:25:53.033
as people are starting
to use Linux.

00:25:53.033 --> 00:25:55.267
The hackers are going
off the Web sites

00:25:55.267 --> 00:25:56.834
because they're
easier to attack.

00:25:56.834 --> 00:25:59.634
People don't necessarily patch
Apache to the latest version,

00:25:59.634 --> 00:26:01.901
and then there'll be
vulnerabilities.

00:26:01.901 --> 00:26:04.067
So if you're running
your own servers,

00:26:04.067 --> 00:26:05.734
you need to make sure
they're up to date.

00:26:05.734 --> 00:26:08.734
And there's a cost there too.
Don't forget about that cost.

00:26:08.734 --> 00:26:12.501
Joyent and Sun off
a kind of hosted platform.

00:26:12.501 --> 00:26:15.968
That's scalable, that runs
for free for very low usage

00:26:15.968 --> 00:26:19.767
up to cost once you start
to get a bit of traffic,

00:26:19.767 --> 00:26:23.000
and it's on demand, so you can
scale them up and down.

00:26:23.000 --> 00:26:26.067
Some of you may know
of Amazon EC2.

00:26:26.067 --> 00:26:28.834
They basically let you
rent machines--virtual machines,

00:26:28.834 --> 00:26:30.267
and you build
an image and install it,

00:26:30.267 --> 00:26:32.033
but again you'll need
to think about sys admin

00:26:32.033 --> 00:26:34.234
and patching
and all that good stuff.

00:26:34.234 --> 00:26:38.801
They recently launched,
I think last week, on the 18th,

00:26:38.801 --> 00:26:40.868
a system that allows you
to auto-scale based on demand,

00:26:40.868 --> 00:26:43.501
so they just deploy
new servers as you need it.

00:26:43.501 --> 00:26:46.267
But you're still having to
provision the software yourself.

00:26:46.267 --> 00:26:47.601
Now I don't want
to sit here and go,

00:26:47.601 --> 00:26:48.934
"Well, Google have got
the solution for you,"

00:26:48.934 --> 00:26:50.133
'cause that's not
what this is about,

00:26:50.133 --> 00:26:51.901
but if I were
a developer in this age,

00:26:51.901 --> 00:26:53.167
I'd be looking at App Engine

00:26:53.167 --> 00:26:54.634
or something similar
pretty seriously.

00:26:54.634 --> 00:26:57.167
Because App Engine lets you
focus just on the software.

00:26:57.167 --> 00:26:58.400
You build the software,

00:26:58.400 --> 00:27:00.667
Google takes care
of scaling it up and down.

00:27:00.667 --> 00:27:03.868
And remember,
with social applications,

00:27:03.868 --> 00:27:05.200
things can go viral
very quickly.

00:27:05.200 --> 00:27:07.968
You get a few key people
who are interested in your app,

00:27:07.968 --> 00:27:09.467
they tell their friends,
and suddenly bang,

00:27:09.467 --> 00:27:11.100
you've got a million users,
it can happen.

00:27:11.100 --> 00:27:13.601
Here's a graph of growth.

00:27:13.601 --> 00:27:16.734
It's pretty simplistic, but it
should give you a basic idea.

00:27:16.734 --> 00:27:19.367
If you're using a LAMP stack,
if you're renting machines,

00:27:19.367 --> 00:27:20.934
your machines are gonna
be good to a certain point,

00:27:20.934 --> 00:27:22.467
and then you're gonna need
to deploy additional ones.

00:27:22.467 --> 00:27:24.801
So you're really gonna see
this step growth graph.

00:27:24.801 --> 00:27:26.133
And something
to think about there

00:27:26.133 --> 00:27:28.467
is if load
diminishes over time,

00:27:28.467 --> 00:27:30.067
how do you take
those servers offline?

00:27:30.067 --> 00:27:31.334
You're still gonna
be paying rental,

00:27:31.334 --> 00:27:32.567
and chances are
you're gonna be

00:27:32.567 --> 00:27:34.300
in for a minimum
contract period.

00:27:34.300 --> 00:27:37.200
So think carefully
about buying new servers.

00:27:37.200 --> 00:27:39.067
EC2 lets you scale
a little more smoothly.

00:27:39.067 --> 00:27:42.000
You can switch them
on and off as load requires.

00:27:42.000 --> 00:27:44.968
App Engine's a slightly
smoother graph.

00:27:44.968 --> 00:27:46.234
I don't want to sit here
and push App Engine,

00:27:46.234 --> 00:27:48.033
but because you're just
focusing on process,

00:27:48.033 --> 00:27:50.100
you're literally only
paying for what you use.

00:27:50.100 --> 00:27:51.501
The other advantage
of App Engine is you'll get

00:27:51.501 --> 00:27:53.767
up to five million page views
a month for free.

00:27:53.767 --> 00:27:56.701
So they'll let you experiment
with different services

00:27:56.701 --> 00:27:58.167
and see if your
business is viable

00:27:58.167 --> 00:28:01.901
before you actually have to
start paying hosting costs.

00:28:01.901 --> 00:28:03.534
There are a bunch
of talks on App Engine

00:28:03.534 --> 00:28:04.634
if you want to learn more,

00:28:04.634 --> 00:28:06.234
and there's some
office hours happening

00:28:06.234 --> 00:28:07.868
if you really want
to play grab the SDK,

00:28:07.868 --> 00:28:10.601
have a knock around, that's not
what we're here to talk about.

00:28:10.601 --> 00:28:12.934
Marketing and advertising.
So advertising.

00:28:12.934 --> 00:28:15.234
You've built your application,
you want to get it known.

00:28:15.234 --> 00:28:16.334
There's a few ways
to do this.

00:28:16.334 --> 00:28:18.734
Obviously AdWords--

00:28:18.734 --> 00:28:22.067
paid networks where you can
advertise your application--

00:28:22.067 --> 00:28:24.100
but then actually within
the social networks as well.

00:28:24.100 --> 00:28:27.067
You can do gallery sponsorship,
as Gerardo mentioned,

00:28:27.067 --> 00:28:29.000
there are even some ways
to get your app

00:28:29.000 --> 00:28:30.334
sponsored in exchange
for rev share,

00:28:30.334 --> 00:28:32.834
you know, get it featured
in gallery listings.

00:28:32.834 --> 00:28:34.000
There are app
ad networks too,

00:28:34.000 --> 00:28:35.567
so you can advertise
within other apps,

00:28:35.567 --> 00:28:37.133
you can advertise
on the social networks,

00:28:37.133 --> 00:28:39.367
you can advertise in places
where people would go,

00:28:39.367 --> 00:28:41.100
and advertise
in areas where people

00:28:41.100 --> 00:28:42.434
actually engage
in what you're doing.

00:28:42.434 --> 00:28:46.167
So if you're building
a virtual dog application,

00:28:46.167 --> 00:28:48.000
go to pet sites
and say, you know,

00:28:48.000 --> 00:28:49.367
if you're thinking
about buying a dog,

00:28:49.367 --> 00:28:51.234
why not try the app first to see
if you can look after one?

00:28:51.234 --> 00:28:53.200
There's no real, kind of,
you know, parallel to draw,

00:28:53.200 --> 00:28:54.868
but people who like dogs
in real life

00:28:54.868 --> 00:28:56.734
probably like
virtual dogs too.

00:28:56.734 --> 00:28:59.133
So think
about that as well.

00:28:59.133 --> 00:29:01.200
Then you've got
organic growth.

00:29:01.200 --> 00:29:03.667
So within the social network,
you've got a bunch of mechanisms

00:29:03.667 --> 00:29:05.567
for talking to people.

00:29:05.567 --> 00:29:06.767
You've got activity streams,

00:29:06.767 --> 00:29:08.100
so when someone
installs an application

00:29:08.100 --> 00:29:10.000
you can write to that
and advertise the fact.

00:29:10.000 --> 00:29:13.667
You've got installing the
application on a user's profile.

00:29:13.667 --> 00:29:15.634
You can send invitations out.

00:29:15.634 --> 00:29:18.033
But be smart
about sending invitations.

00:29:18.033 --> 00:29:19.434
One of the things
that really upsets me

00:29:19.434 --> 00:29:22.000
about applications
I see today is I install one,

00:29:22.000 --> 00:29:24.868
and it says, "Send an invitation
to all your friends."

00:29:24.868 --> 00:29:26.801
Probably most of my friends
aren't gonna like

00:29:26.801 --> 00:29:28.634
the same applications
that I do.

00:29:28.634 --> 00:29:30.634
And applications
have the ability

00:29:30.634 --> 00:29:32.300
to learn about my friends.

00:29:32.300 --> 00:29:33.667
Especially in OpenSocial.

00:29:33.667 --> 00:29:35.834
I can poll my friends,
learn about their interests,

00:29:35.834 --> 00:29:38.000
so if I'm installing
a snowboarding application,

00:29:38.000 --> 00:29:39.701
instead of just saying,
"Give this to all my friends,"

00:29:39.701 --> 00:29:42.133
why not find out which of my
friends also like snowboarding?

00:29:42.133 --> 00:29:43.534
And then intelligently say,

00:29:43.534 --> 00:29:45.400
"Hey, we see five of your
friends are also snowboarders,

00:29:45.400 --> 00:29:47.234
"do you think they'd
like this app too?

00:29:47.234 --> 00:29:48.601
Click here to send
an invite."

00:29:48.601 --> 00:29:51.334
It's a lot friendlier,
and users are gonna

00:29:51.334 --> 00:29:53.400
feel like your app's
a bit smarter,

00:29:53.400 --> 00:29:55.300
and that it's actually something
they'd want to pass on.

00:29:55.300 --> 00:29:58.033
And then of course
notifications.

00:29:58.033 --> 00:29:59.534
Once you install the app
or do something

00:29:59.534 --> 00:30:02.267
You can write to your wall, or
write to your activity stream,

00:30:02.267 --> 00:30:05.267
or, you know, send out mails,
or whatever it might be.

00:30:05.267 --> 00:30:08.868
But it's not just within
the social network itself.

00:30:08.868 --> 00:30:14.868
BuddyPoke is the most popular
application on OpenSocial.

00:30:14.868 --> 00:30:17.634
And there's about 3 1/2 thousand
videos on YouTube,

00:30:17.634 --> 00:30:19.767
and they're all kind of,
you know, a few thousand views,

00:30:19.767 --> 00:30:21.267
but even if each of them
were only 1,000,

00:30:21.267 --> 00:30:25.200
that's still, what, 3 1/2
million views of BuddyPoke.

00:30:25.200 --> 00:30:28.167
And if you are gonna put videos
of your content up on YouTube,

00:30:28.167 --> 00:30:29.534
think about the metadata.

00:30:29.534 --> 00:30:31.667
See in the red box? "Buddy Poke,
Buddy Poke, Buddy Poke..."

00:30:31.667 --> 00:30:33.567
Sure, if you search for "Buddy
Poke," that's the first result.

00:30:33.567 --> 00:30:36.000
Simply because they
cracked the metadata.

00:30:36.000 --> 00:30:37.567
But how many people
search for Buddy Poke?

00:30:37.567 --> 00:30:39.267
Probably not that many.

00:30:39.267 --> 00:30:40.634
Think about what
your application is,

00:30:40.634 --> 00:30:41.834
don't just put the name,

00:30:41.834 --> 00:30:43.901
but also put the types
of things that it is.

00:30:43.901 --> 00:30:45.801
So if it's a virtual pet app,
don't put, you know,

00:30:45.801 --> 00:30:48.367
"My V-Pet."
Put "virtual pet."

00:30:48.367 --> 00:30:51.701
You know,
"play with your dog online."

00:30:51.701 --> 00:30:53.133
Community management.
This is the next one.

00:30:53.133 --> 00:30:55.634
So you've got, you know,
100,000 users,

00:30:55.634 --> 00:30:58.167
and some of them are gonna
start breaking things,

00:30:58.167 --> 00:30:59.701
so you need to think
about security issues.

00:30:59.701 --> 00:31:02.634
Some of them are just
gonna be stupid.

00:31:02.634 --> 00:31:04.133
You know, users are dumb.

00:31:04.133 --> 00:31:07.033
Not every user, but guarantee,
lowest common denominator.

00:31:07.033 --> 00:31:08.734
My mom hitting
your application

00:31:08.734 --> 00:31:11.067
is gonna click in the wrong
place every single time,

00:31:11.067 --> 00:31:12.634
and bookmark places
that you didn't expect

00:31:12.634 --> 00:31:13.767
after submitting a form

00:31:13.767 --> 00:31:15.601
with something weird
in a query string,

00:31:15.601 --> 00:31:16.934
so that when she comes
back to that bookmark

00:31:16.934 --> 00:31:18.334
it breaks something.

00:31:18.334 --> 00:31:20.000
And it's something
you haven't thought about.

00:31:20.000 --> 00:31:21.534
So you're gonna want
to test all this stuff.

00:31:21.534 --> 00:31:23.200
But you're also gonna
want to make sure

00:31:23.200 --> 00:31:27.167
there's a feedback loop for
your users to report problems.

00:31:27.167 --> 00:31:28.868
The cool thing is because
of social networks,

00:31:28.868 --> 00:31:32.400
you can actually leverage users
who are using your apps

00:31:32.400 --> 00:31:34.334
and recruit power users
to help support.

00:31:34.334 --> 00:31:35.767
You know, people who actually
enjoy playing with it

00:31:35.767 --> 00:31:37.033
and have a bit
of time to spare

00:31:37.033 --> 00:31:38.667
and are really happy
to give their time.

00:31:38.667 --> 00:31:40.601
With the inclusion
of virtual currency,

00:31:40.601 --> 00:31:42.067
maybe you can reward them.

00:31:42.067 --> 00:31:43.834
So with the Mouse Hunt game,
people who are, you know,

00:31:43.834 --> 00:31:45.234
happy to support your forums

00:31:45.234 --> 00:31:47.501
with users who are
having install issues,

00:31:47.501 --> 00:31:50.200
maybe chuck them a few pieces
of gold or a new bit of cheese

00:31:50.200 --> 00:31:52.200
every time they help
someone out effectively.

00:31:52.200 --> 00:31:53.367
It's a really nice
way to do it,

00:31:53.367 --> 00:31:55.934
it's not costing
you anything overtly,

00:31:55.934 --> 00:32:00.567
but it's recruiting a great
bunch of people to help you out.

00:32:00.567 --> 00:32:03.267
And scale by
leveraging your users.

00:32:03.267 --> 00:32:04.934
So also forums.

00:32:04.934 --> 00:32:07.234
Where people can actually
post these messages.

00:32:07.234 --> 00:32:08.567
Most social networks
will have

00:32:08.567 --> 00:32:10.467
a discussion area
that you can use.

00:32:10.467 --> 00:32:12.000
But there are things
like Google Groups

00:32:12.000 --> 00:32:14.100
where you can set up
free discussion forums too,

00:32:14.100 --> 00:32:16.801
if that's what
you want to do.

00:32:16.801 --> 00:32:21.167
Now, other costs.
Ad sales.

00:32:21.167 --> 00:32:23.234
You've got some ads
running on your application.

00:32:23.234 --> 00:32:25.868
Maybe your application's
become so popular

00:32:25.868 --> 00:32:27.300
the ad network
you were using

00:32:27.300 --> 00:32:28.767
can't actually
deliver inventory.

00:32:28.767 --> 00:32:31.167
After a certain point, you know,
ads just stop showing.

00:32:31.167 --> 00:32:32.634
So you're gonna
have to either find

00:32:32.634 --> 00:32:34.100
a manual
or an automated solution

00:32:34.100 --> 00:32:35.634
that lets you switch
ad networks,

00:32:35.634 --> 00:32:38.367
possibly multiple times a day,
if your app's really popular.

00:32:38.367 --> 00:32:40.300
This is something
to think about early on

00:32:40.300 --> 00:32:42.567
so that you're ready
when it happens.

00:32:42.567 --> 00:32:43.567
Direct sales force.

00:32:43.567 --> 00:32:44.734
Maybe it gets to the point

00:32:44.734 --> 00:32:46.567
where you have built
this $100-million app,

00:32:46.567 --> 00:32:48.100
and you want to have
a direct sales force

00:32:48.100 --> 00:32:50.501
who are ringing people up to
advertise specifically with you.

00:32:50.501 --> 00:32:52.501
Again these are costs
you need to think about.

00:32:52.501 --> 00:32:53.701
One of the cool things
about salespeople, though,

00:32:53.701 --> 00:32:55.067
is they work for commission.

00:32:55.067 --> 00:32:57.701
So you can only pay them
if they're really successful.

00:32:57.701 --> 00:33:00.367
But it's still gonna be
a cost that's associated.

00:33:00.367 --> 00:33:01.567
Rev sharing, partnerships.

00:33:01.567 --> 00:33:02.968
If you're using
something like AdSense,

00:33:02.968 --> 00:33:04.300
don't forget a chunk
of money

00:33:04.300 --> 00:33:07.167
will actually go to
the network providing the ads.

00:33:07.167 --> 00:33:08.934
On fixed costs--
office, legal.

00:33:08.934 --> 00:33:10.267
So if you're
renting offices,

00:33:10.267 --> 00:33:11.934
don't forget rent
is a pretty big deal.

00:33:11.934 --> 00:33:14.133
Electricity,
things like that. Tax.

00:33:14.133 --> 00:33:16.467
But more importantly
legal costs.

00:33:16.467 --> 00:33:18.133
This is a social network
application you're building.

00:33:18.133 --> 00:33:21.434
You're gonna be
interacting with user data.

00:33:21.434 --> 00:33:23.133
The moment
you start to do that

00:33:23.133 --> 00:33:26.200
you want to have
a rock-solid privacy policy.

00:33:26.200 --> 00:33:27.567
You want to make it
absolutely clear

00:33:27.567 --> 00:33:28.968
what the terms
of service are,

00:33:28.968 --> 00:33:30.767
what you're gonna be doing
with peoples' data.

00:33:30.767 --> 00:33:32.634
You can try
and write this yourself.

00:33:32.634 --> 00:33:34.234
You might be
very successful,

00:33:34.234 --> 00:33:36.300
or you might get sued because
you didn't make it clear

00:33:36.300 --> 00:33:38.434
what was happening or
the language wasn't appropriate.

00:33:38.434 --> 00:33:40.767
One of the best things
you can do early on

00:33:40.767 --> 00:33:43.033
is invest a little bit
of money in getting

00:33:43.033 --> 00:33:46.300
a rock-solid legal disclaimer
or, you know, terms of service.

00:33:46.300 --> 00:33:47.834
From a professional.

00:33:47.834 --> 00:33:49.234
Make sure it's
from a professional.

00:33:49.234 --> 00:33:50.667
That's absolutely key.

00:33:50.667 --> 00:33:52.534
Tracking and optimizing.

00:33:52.534 --> 00:33:54.000
So they talked a little bit
about this earlier,

00:33:54.000 --> 00:33:58.567
but you want to look
at what your users are doing.

00:33:58.567 --> 00:34:02.200
I speak to so many big companies
in the UK and across Europe

00:34:02.200 --> 00:34:04.067
who have analytics
tools installed,

00:34:04.067 --> 00:34:05.634
and then you say, "Okay, so
how many users are you getting?"

00:34:05.634 --> 00:34:07.133
They'll turn around
and go,

00:34:07.133 --> 00:34:09.634
"Oh, we don't really know.
We don't look at the data."

00:34:09.634 --> 00:34:10.934
You're recording it.
It's there.

00:34:10.934 --> 00:34:12.100
That's actually
information

00:34:12.100 --> 00:34:13.534
about who's coming
to your Web site.

00:34:13.534 --> 00:34:15.801
If you're not looking
at this stuff every single day,

00:34:15.801 --> 00:34:17.133
you're missing a trick.

00:34:17.133 --> 00:34:19.567
This is a real-time
kind of health check.

00:34:19.567 --> 00:34:22.200
Pulse of who's interacting
with your Web site,

00:34:22.200 --> 00:34:24.367
or in this case,
your social application.

00:34:24.367 --> 00:34:27.300
So record data,
look at it, and react to it.

00:34:27.300 --> 00:34:28.701
If people are clicking
on the wrong button,

00:34:28.701 --> 00:34:30.968
if they're going through
the wrong path to get somewhere,

00:34:30.968 --> 00:34:32.567
it may be the fact that
your users are just clumsy

00:34:32.567 --> 00:34:34.100
and don't know
what they're doing,

00:34:34.100 --> 00:34:36.667
but it could also be possible
that it's not entirely clear.

00:34:36.667 --> 00:34:38.601
You know, we can sometimes
be so close to our apps

00:34:38.601 --> 00:34:40.968
that it seems really obvious
what people should be doing.

00:34:40.968 --> 00:34:42.300
A user comes in
from nowhere,

00:34:42.300 --> 00:34:43.834
clicks on things
that you just didn't expect,

00:34:43.834 --> 00:34:46.300
and ends up in a terrible,
terrible mess.

00:34:46.300 --> 00:34:48.701
So make sure that you're
monitoring this stuff too.

00:34:48.701 --> 00:34:50.968
Also test
different solutions.

00:34:50.968 --> 00:34:53.767
At Google, for Google Search,
at any given time,

00:34:53.767 --> 00:34:55.567
we have five to ten
experiments

00:34:55.567 --> 00:34:57.167
going on for
our search results.

00:34:57.167 --> 00:34:58.501
And I think we deployed
something like

00:34:58.501 --> 00:35:01.467
250 changes to our
search results last year.

00:35:01.467 --> 00:35:02.667
So we're always trying
to tweak

00:35:02.667 --> 00:35:04.501
just a little bit
to make things better.

00:35:04.501 --> 00:35:05.868
And whenever
you're thinking

00:35:05.868 --> 00:35:07.601
about building a Web site
or building an application,

00:35:07.601 --> 00:35:09.167
you should be thinking
about this too.

00:35:09.167 --> 00:35:10.334
I'm not suggesting you get

00:35:10.334 --> 00:35:11.868
that aggressive
with the number of changes,

00:35:11.868 --> 00:35:15.100
but I guarantee whatever you
launch isn't the best it can be.

00:35:15.100 --> 00:35:18.367
So you should always be
looking for better solutions.

00:35:18.367 --> 00:35:24.367
With that said,
we're on to best practices.

00:35:24.367 --> 00:35:27.968
Capiel: I think Chewy
mentioned it quite a bit,

00:35:27.968 --> 00:35:30.167
and I just want
to really bring this home

00:35:30.167 --> 00:35:33.200
that you got to measure
and you got to optimize

00:35:33.200 --> 00:35:34.667
what you're doing.

00:35:34.667 --> 00:35:38.801
And there's really kind of three
key metrics at a high level

00:35:38.801 --> 00:35:39.968
that you're gonna
be looking at.

00:35:39.968 --> 00:35:41.968
First is reach,

00:35:41.968 --> 00:35:46.434
which is how many people are
you able to reach and acquire?

00:35:46.434 --> 00:35:47.767
Then there's retention,

00:35:47.767 --> 00:35:50.234
so you've gotten a user
into your application.

00:35:50.234 --> 00:35:52.968
How often can you get them
to use the application

00:35:52.968 --> 00:35:54.133
and stay in there?

00:35:54.133 --> 00:35:56.067
So how often you
get 'em to come back,

00:35:56.067 --> 00:35:57.901
and how long
do you keep them for?

00:35:57.901 --> 00:36:01.367
And then finally if you do
a great job of those first two,

00:36:01.367 --> 00:36:03.400
then I would
highly encourage you

00:36:03.400 --> 00:36:06.267
to pay a lot of attention
to the next piece, which is--

00:36:06.267 --> 00:36:08.167
okay, I got all these users,
they're coming back,

00:36:08.167 --> 00:36:10.367
now how do I turn 'em
into dollars?

00:36:10.367 --> 00:36:13.300
And as you can see
from the ranges on this slide,

00:36:13.300 --> 00:36:17.667
there tend to be pretty wide
ranges in terms of, you know,

00:36:17.667 --> 00:36:21.000
your ability
to convert users,

00:36:21.000 --> 00:36:24.100
to acquire them,
and then also your ability

00:36:24.100 --> 00:36:28.400
to take users
and make them active users.

00:36:28.400 --> 00:36:30.033
And Google Analytics,
by the way,

00:36:30.033 --> 00:36:31.400
is a great tool for that.

00:36:31.400 --> 00:36:34.834
Looking at bounce rates
on your application is good,

00:36:34.834 --> 00:36:37.734
looking at time spent
on your application is good.

00:36:37.734 --> 00:36:39.834
Those are key metrics
that you want to look at

00:36:39.834 --> 00:36:42.100
in terms of determining
whether you have

00:36:42.100 --> 00:36:44.767
a return problem
or an acquisition problem.

00:36:44.767 --> 00:36:48.567
So what are the communication
channels that you can use?

00:36:48.567 --> 00:36:51.601
Well, Chewy talked
a little bit about those.

00:36:51.601 --> 00:36:54.234
There's activity streams,
and there's notifications,

00:36:54.234 --> 00:36:58.400
and those depend quite a bit
in terms of the social network

00:36:58.400 --> 00:37:00.834
about how they're
actually implemented,

00:37:00.834 --> 00:37:02.400
but almost all
the social networks

00:37:02.400 --> 00:37:05.000
have those
two basic channels.

00:37:05.000 --> 00:37:06.868
The key is,
to these channels--

00:37:06.868 --> 00:37:08.200
they can be very powerful,

00:37:08.200 --> 00:37:11.367
but they can also be
very detrimental to your app.

00:37:11.367 --> 00:37:14.100
Like in the case
of Myspace,

00:37:14.100 --> 00:37:16.767
a notification is not only
a way that you can get someone

00:37:16.767 --> 00:37:18.467
to reengage with
your application,

00:37:18.467 --> 00:37:19.634
but it's also a way
that you can

00:37:19.634 --> 00:37:21.467
get 'em to uninstall
your application

00:37:21.467 --> 00:37:22.834
if you're spamming them.

00:37:22.834 --> 00:37:26.734
So the key to not spam,

00:37:26.734 --> 00:37:29.701
or to make your messages
actually relevant

00:37:29.701 --> 00:37:32.601
and not perceived as spam,
is to do a lot of testing.

00:37:32.601 --> 00:37:35.567
And A/B testing is
a very common technique

00:37:35.567 --> 00:37:36.634
where you're gonna be
testing

00:37:36.634 --> 00:37:38.400
different types
of dynamic content,

00:37:38.400 --> 00:37:42.334
you're gonna test
different types of offers,

00:37:42.334 --> 00:37:46.934
different pieces of content
that you consider relevant.

00:37:46.934 --> 00:37:51.801
For an A/B test you're gonna
want to typically use

00:37:51.801 --> 00:37:53.367
some type of analytics tool.

00:37:53.367 --> 00:37:56.334
Kontagent provides
some great analytic tools

00:37:56.334 --> 00:37:58.167
for doing A/B testing.

00:37:58.167 --> 00:37:59.601
But there's really--

00:37:59.601 --> 00:38:01.067
also a lot of people have
homegrown tools,

00:38:01.067 --> 00:38:02.834
and you can even use
Google Analytics

00:38:02.834 --> 00:38:04.834
for doing some of this.

00:38:04.834 --> 00:38:06.834
The interesting thing
about A/B testing

00:38:06.834 --> 00:38:09.601
is that everyone
always kind of thinks

00:38:09.601 --> 00:38:12.100
what they think
users want to hear,

00:38:12.100 --> 00:38:13.367
what they're gonna
react to,

00:38:13.367 --> 00:38:14.834
and I guarantee
you, like,

00:38:14.834 --> 00:38:17.601
if you looked
at these two messages here,

00:38:17.601 --> 00:38:18.734
half of the crowd
would say

00:38:18.734 --> 00:38:20.267
the bottom one
is the most successful,

00:38:20.267 --> 00:38:23.634
and half the crowd
would say the top.

00:38:23.634 --> 00:38:25.968
You just don't know
unless you test things.

00:38:25.968 --> 00:38:28.934
So in this example,
these two messages here

00:38:28.934 --> 00:38:31.334
had a pretty huge
difference

00:38:31.334 --> 00:38:34.100
in terms of conversion
rates.

00:38:34.100 --> 00:38:35.567
The other day I was hearing

00:38:35.567 --> 00:38:39.934
one of the top application
developers on Myspace

00:38:39.934 --> 00:38:42.167
talk about,
and he was saying,

00:38:42.167 --> 00:38:43.934
"Don't get discouraged

00:38:43.934 --> 00:38:46.534
"if your application growth
is completely flat.

00:38:46.534 --> 00:38:49.400
"Just keep tweaking things.
Little things, little things.

00:38:49.400 --> 00:38:51.901
"Keep tweaking and measuring
back and forth,

00:38:51.901 --> 00:38:53.934
"and you're gonna find
that one little thing

00:38:53.934 --> 00:38:56.701
"that actually really
starts to kind of drive

00:38:56.701 --> 00:38:58.534
"viral growth
in your application,

00:38:58.534 --> 00:39:03.434
and then hopefully
also retention."

00:39:03.434 --> 00:39:05.100
So the other thing is
it's not only gonna be

00:39:05.100 --> 00:39:07.501
in the messaging that you
want to do your A/B testing,

00:39:07.501 --> 00:39:10.701
it's gonna be with what
revenue sources you're using.

00:39:10.701 --> 00:39:12.434
So you're gonna want
to do A/B testing

00:39:12.434 --> 00:39:14.834
on whether I should
use direct payment,

00:39:14.834 --> 00:39:17.701
whether I should charge people
directly with credit cards,

00:39:17.701 --> 00:39:19.300
or whether I should
present offers.

00:39:19.300 --> 00:39:20.968
And then even
within offers,

00:39:20.968 --> 00:39:24.067
you're gonna want
to be doing A/B testing

00:39:24.067 --> 00:39:27.334
to actually determine, of all
the companies that are out there

00:39:27.334 --> 00:39:29.467
that provide offer
solutions,

00:39:29.467 --> 00:39:32.133
which ones convert
the best for my audience?

00:39:32.133 --> 00:39:34.167
And that's really gonna
depend,

00:39:34.167 --> 00:39:37.133
from application
to application,

00:39:37.133 --> 00:39:40.467
which--
which offer provider--

00:39:40.467 --> 00:39:42.467
which payment provider
works best

00:39:42.467 --> 00:39:43.901
is gonna be very different

00:39:43.901 --> 00:39:48.100
because every application
has a very different audience.

00:39:48.100 --> 00:39:49.868
And a great tool is--

00:39:49.868 --> 00:39:53.868
Symmetrix has some great tools
for doing that as well.

00:39:53.868 --> 00:39:57.767
So the most
successful applications

00:39:57.767 --> 00:40:01.067
that we're seeing across
the social networks are games,

00:40:01.067 --> 00:40:02.567
particularly on Myspace.

00:40:02.567 --> 00:40:05.667
Games have done
very, very well.

00:40:05.667 --> 00:40:10.267
I think not every application
has to be a game,

00:40:10.267 --> 00:40:13.534
and not every one of you better
say, once I develop a game,

00:40:13.534 --> 00:40:16.033
but I would highly
encourage you to take a look

00:40:16.033 --> 00:40:18.868
at the design patterns that
the game providers are using

00:40:18.868 --> 00:40:21.300
because they've become
very smart about this

00:40:21.300 --> 00:40:24.334
in terms of the ways
that they get people

00:40:24.334 --> 00:40:26.734
to re-engage
with the applications

00:40:26.734 --> 00:40:30.334
by using leaderboards,
leveling up, point systems.

00:40:30.334 --> 00:40:32.534
Providing kind of
special offers that are--

00:40:32.534 --> 00:40:34.033
that are available--

00:40:34.033 --> 00:40:36.367
every day there's a new offer
that's available.

00:40:36.367 --> 00:40:39.300
These are all techniques
that any application

00:40:39.300 --> 00:40:42.634
can really
take advantage of.

00:40:42.634 --> 00:40:45.300
And here's
a great quote from--

00:40:45.300 --> 00:40:47.834
I'm guessing it's
from Dan Yue over at Playdom--

00:40:47.834 --> 00:40:51.467
in terms of what--
how they look at things.

00:40:51.467 --> 00:40:53.434
They don't assume anything,
as I was saying.

00:40:53.434 --> 00:40:55.601
They measure
and test everything,

00:40:55.601 --> 00:40:58.033
and that's--that's how they
listen to their customers.

00:40:58.033 --> 00:40:59.601
And community boards,
by the way,

00:40:59.601 --> 00:41:01.968
are also a great way
to listen to your customers.

00:41:01.968 --> 00:41:04.868
They're just typically
not as quantitative.

00:41:04.868 --> 00:41:08.234
They're a little bit more
qualitative in nature.

00:41:08.234 --> 00:41:09.634
So that's it.

00:41:09.634 --> 00:41:13.067
I'll let Shawn kind of wrap up
with some great stats.

00:41:13.067 --> 00:41:14.200
Shen: Thank you.

00:41:14.200 --> 00:41:16.601
Okay, so,
ready for some numbers.

00:41:16.601 --> 00:41:20.901
Let's look at some stats
from within the industry,

00:41:20.901 --> 00:41:23.033
how much money
we can make.

00:41:23.033 --> 00:41:24.767
It's estimated
that this space--

00:41:24.767 --> 00:41:28.100
it's been only around for, like,
almost just two years,

00:41:28.100 --> 00:41:29.901
and estimated revenue
stands around,

00:41:29.901 --> 00:41:31.734
like, more than
$1/2 million.

00:41:31.734 --> 00:41:35.234
Anywhere from $500
to 700 million.

00:41:35.234 --> 00:41:36.734
A lot of developers
out there--

00:41:36.734 --> 00:41:37.901
about the top ten
developers--

00:41:37.901 --> 00:41:40.367
they account
for almost 2/3 of the revenue.

00:41:40.367 --> 00:41:42.667
The big ones
that Chewy mentioned earlier,

00:41:42.667 --> 00:41:45.901
they account for, like,
2/3 of the total revenue.

00:41:45.901 --> 00:41:47.567
In terms of revenue split,

00:41:47.567 --> 00:41:51.067
you can see that ads
estimated to be 20%.

00:41:51.067 --> 00:41:52.300
The middle part,

00:41:52.300 --> 00:41:53.901
which is the virtual
economy-based models,

00:41:53.901 --> 00:41:56.200
they account for
a huge portion of it.

00:41:56.200 --> 00:41:59.200
Yesterday
at the Fireside Chat,

00:41:59.200 --> 00:42:01.200
if you guys heard
from the developers,

00:42:01.200 --> 00:42:04.434
most of them are heavily
moving into that area.

00:42:04.434 --> 00:42:07.634
Between direct pay, which is,
like, credit card or PayPal,

00:42:07.634 --> 00:42:11.033
and then offers,
is about a 40/30% split.

00:42:11.033 --> 00:42:15.234
And the rest of it
is about 10%.

00:42:15.234 --> 00:42:16.601
To that regard,

00:42:16.601 --> 00:42:20.567
because we have this huge
interest in virtual economy,

00:42:20.567 --> 00:42:24.667
there are two exciting news
in OpenSocial

00:42:24.667 --> 00:42:27.167
that I'd like
to just mention.

00:42:27.167 --> 00:42:30.701
One is hi5
that they recently used--

00:42:30.701 --> 00:42:34.567
this virtual currency API
and OpenSocial technology,

00:42:34.567 --> 00:42:38.701
and they implemented
a network-wide hi5 coin.

00:42:38.701 --> 00:42:42.000
The advantage of having
a network-wide coin--

00:42:42.000 --> 00:42:45.167
currency is that
developers--

00:42:45.167 --> 00:42:47.934
they can just hook into it
using some standard API,

00:42:47.934 --> 00:42:49.801
and right away
their application will be able

00:42:49.801 --> 00:42:52.067
to support payment
and transactions.

00:42:52.067 --> 00:42:55.701
And from the user's
standpoint,

00:42:55.701 --> 00:43:00.133
there is a very good advantage
of trust because, like,

00:43:00.133 --> 00:43:02.567
a lot of the
international markets--

00:43:02.567 --> 00:43:05.334
Brazil, you know, hi5
in Latin American countries,

00:43:05.334 --> 00:43:07.701
users--they are not really
comfortable paying

00:43:07.701 --> 00:43:10.234
any developer that they
don't have any idea about.

00:43:10.234 --> 00:43:12.367
So if you provide
a hi5 coin,

00:43:12.367 --> 00:43:13.634
right away people say,

00:43:13.634 --> 00:43:15.534
"Okay, I'm paying hi5,
I can trust that."

00:43:15.534 --> 00:43:17.400
The transaction's
a lot smoother.

00:43:17.400 --> 00:43:20.033
And the first application
that's done by RockYou--

00:43:20.033 --> 00:43:22.400
and they have
a Sandbox booth here

00:43:22.400 --> 00:43:25.133
if you want
to talk with them--

00:43:25.133 --> 00:43:26.734
This is the first
application

00:43:26.734 --> 00:43:30.701
that they did this
integration with hi5 coins.

00:43:30.701 --> 00:43:32.267
The next one is Cyworld.

00:43:32.267 --> 00:43:36.434
We announced that Cyworld
is gonna support OpenSocial.

00:43:36.434 --> 00:43:39.000
They have their Sandbox
open already.

00:43:39.000 --> 00:43:40.567
Some of the developers
are working with them.

00:43:40.567 --> 00:43:42.267
I'd just like to
call out that we have

00:43:42.267 --> 00:43:45.334
two representatives
from Cyworld here,

00:43:45.334 --> 00:43:48.000
so if you guys want
to come to talk with them later,

00:43:48.000 --> 00:43:49.367
please feel free.

00:43:49.367 --> 00:43:51.467
Also I'd like to take
this opportunity to mention

00:43:51.467 --> 00:43:54.534
that Hyves from Europe,
they are also here, right?

00:43:54.534 --> 00:43:56.634
And if you guys are interested
in talking with them,

00:43:56.634 --> 00:43:59.501
they are very much
like a Dutch--

00:43:59.501 --> 00:44:01.868
like a Netherland-focused
social network.

00:44:01.868 --> 00:44:03.334
Very active user base.

00:44:03.334 --> 00:44:04.767
So if you're interested
in talking with them,

00:44:04.767 --> 00:44:07.601
please go to them
after the talk.

00:44:07.601 --> 00:44:09.033
Earlier we also
mentioned

00:44:09.033 --> 00:44:11.200
there are various other
providers in the space.

00:44:11.200 --> 00:44:15.100
Symmetrix is one, Analytics,
and also Optimization Company.

00:44:15.100 --> 00:44:17.334
They have a Sandbox
demo booth out there,

00:44:17.334 --> 00:44:20.667
so feel free to go
to talk with them.

00:44:20.667 --> 00:44:23.934
This is some screenshots
that I took from Cyworld.

00:44:23.934 --> 00:44:27.133
Cyworld has been a pioneer
in this space for ten years.

00:44:27.133 --> 00:44:31.701
They basically pioneered
this virtual economy-based model

00:44:31.701 --> 00:44:34.067
along with some of
the great Chinese companies.

00:44:34.067 --> 00:44:37.400
It's really popular in China,
as you can see on the screen.

00:44:37.400 --> 00:44:39.467
There is the mini room
that you can set up,

00:44:39.467 --> 00:44:41.567
and then you can buy
all sorts of decorations,

00:44:41.567 --> 00:44:44.467
and there is the homepage,
and there is the mini stories

00:44:44.467 --> 00:44:48.467
that users can share,
and charge and pay each other.

00:44:48.467 --> 00:44:51.234
Okay, so I mentioned
earlier,

00:44:51.234 --> 00:44:54.667
from a developer's perspective,
how much money can we make?

00:44:54.667 --> 00:44:59.234
So here-this is sort of what
I call a small application.

00:44:59.234 --> 00:45:01.133
At the very top
you can see

00:45:01.133 --> 00:45:03.868
the number that I got
from Offerpal, for example.

00:45:03.868 --> 00:45:07.434
How much money are they paying
out to what they call publisher,

00:45:07.434 --> 00:45:08.767
which is really developer?

00:45:08.767 --> 00:45:11.167
How much money
are they paying out?

00:45:11.167 --> 00:45:12.601
The reported number,
average number,

00:45:12.601 --> 00:45:17.501
is about $75 per day
per 1,000 active users.

00:45:17.501 --> 00:45:19.067
So if we take
that number--

00:45:19.067 --> 00:45:23.067
I try to be conservative,
I only take $25.

00:45:23.067 --> 00:45:26.133
If you have an application
that has 10,000 users,

00:45:26.133 --> 00:45:27.334
how much money
would that be?

00:45:27.334 --> 00:45:30.000
25 x 10,000.

00:45:30.000 --> 00:45:33.501
We're talking
about $250 a day.

00:45:33.501 --> 00:45:36.534
That's about, say,
$90,000 a year.

00:45:36.534 --> 00:45:38.868
In terms of hosting cost,
like Chewy covered,

00:45:38.868 --> 00:45:40.267
you probably need,
like, two servers.

00:45:40.267 --> 00:45:41.734
One Web server on the front,

00:45:41.734 --> 00:45:43.334
and one database server
on the back,

00:45:43.334 --> 00:45:46.100
and at $100 apiece,
$200 a month,

00:45:46.100 --> 00:45:48.534
we're talking about
$2,400 a year.

00:45:48.534 --> 00:45:51.901
So even in a relatively
small application,

00:45:51.901 --> 00:45:53.801
the hosting cost
is not a big factor.

00:45:53.801 --> 00:45:55.868
Once you have the traffic,
you'll still be

00:45:55.868 --> 00:45:59.200
looking at a gross profit
of $80,000.

00:45:59.200 --> 00:46:01.100
One person,
you can probably hack away

00:46:01.100 --> 00:46:03.834
and create a lot of virtual
world for your happy users.

00:46:03.834 --> 00:46:06.501
If you have
a medium-sized application

00:46:06.501 --> 00:46:08.467
with, like, 100,000 users,

00:46:08.467 --> 00:46:10.200
then we're talking
about serious business

00:46:10.200 --> 00:46:14.000
because you're talking
about $2,500 a day,

00:46:14.000 --> 00:46:17.434
almost $1 million in revenue--
in gross revenue a year,

00:46:17.434 --> 00:46:19.367
and again the hosting cost,

00:46:19.367 --> 00:46:21.033
if I give it
a very generous number--

00:46:21.033 --> 00:46:22.501
$5,000 a month--

00:46:22.501 --> 00:46:25.000
that's still only $60,000
a year.

00:46:25.000 --> 00:46:27.968
That still leaves you
a lot of profit.

00:46:27.968 --> 00:46:31.067
I put down some
expenses for offices--

00:46:31.067 --> 00:46:34.067
$200,000 for just
general expenses--

00:46:34.067 --> 00:46:38.133
we're still looking
at $650,000 a year.

00:46:38.133 --> 00:46:41.834
You'll probably be able to hire
your own graphic designers,

00:46:41.834 --> 00:46:44.701
and quite a few
developers.

00:46:44.701 --> 00:46:50.100
If you really have a big hit,
with 1 million active users--

00:46:50.100 --> 00:46:52.067
a lot of applications
have that--

00:46:52.067 --> 00:46:54.601
then we're talking
about very serious money.

00:46:54.601 --> 00:46:58.734
$25,000 a day,
almost $10 million a year.

00:46:58.734 --> 00:47:01.367
Hosting cost again
is the smallest,

00:47:01.367 --> 00:47:04.767
insignificant part
of the equation.

00:47:04.767 --> 00:47:09.968
We're talking about $8.9 million
in gross profit.

00:47:09.968 --> 00:47:13.300
We take 2 million
out of expenses,

00:47:13.300 --> 00:47:15.634
we are left with $7 million.

00:47:15.634 --> 00:47:17.767
So that's the number
we are looking at.

00:47:17.767 --> 00:47:21.234
Now I hope I'm getting
your brain really fired up

00:47:21.234 --> 00:47:22.300
with your great ideas--

00:47:22.300 --> 00:47:24.033
go out and build
some great applications.

00:47:24.033 --> 00:47:26.200
So how profitable
is this space?

00:47:26.200 --> 00:47:28.067
If I put it in the grand scheme
of things, you know,

00:47:28.067 --> 00:47:30.267
we have a lot of big companies
like Yahoo and Google.

00:47:30.267 --> 00:47:31.934
These I took some
of the public numbers.

00:47:31.934 --> 00:47:35.334
You can just look at the
revenues of Yahoo and Google.

00:47:35.334 --> 00:47:37.801
So in the social space
we have--

00:47:37.801 --> 00:47:40.801
the market is about
$500-700 million.

00:47:40.801 --> 00:47:42.767
On average, across, you know,
all the networks,

00:47:42.767 --> 00:47:45.734
there are about 50-70 million
active users daily.

00:47:45.734 --> 00:47:50.968
So the payout is anywhere
from 5 to say $12, $15.

00:47:50.968 --> 00:47:54.100
Every user is worth
that much every year for you--

00:47:54.100 --> 00:47:55.467
every active user.

00:47:55.467 --> 00:47:58.167
If you take Yahoo's number,
$7 billion in revenue,

00:47:58.167 --> 00:48:00.901
they have about, say,
150 million active users,

00:48:00.901 --> 00:48:03.534
their user is worth
about $50 apiece.

00:48:03.534 --> 00:48:07.367
And Google is the most
profitable in this metric.

00:48:07.367 --> 00:48:09.200
Google has $22 billion,

00:48:09.200 --> 00:48:12.601
anywhere from 160
to 200 million users.

00:48:12.601 --> 00:48:14.968
Google's user--
every single user is worth $100.

00:48:14.968 --> 00:48:20.968
So what this means is that
it took us two years to grow

00:48:20.968 --> 00:48:24.767
the virtual economy-based model
of the social applications

00:48:24.767 --> 00:48:28.901
to get to the point where
each user is worth, say, $10.

00:48:28.901 --> 00:48:30.667
And then the Web portals

00:48:30.667 --> 00:48:32.968
has been around for,
what, 15 years,

00:48:32.968 --> 00:48:34.868
and each user is $50
to $100.

00:48:34.868 --> 00:48:37.234
There's still a lot
of room to grow,

00:48:37.234 --> 00:48:39.968
and earlier when Gerardo
shared with you

00:48:39.968 --> 00:48:41.167
some of
the revenue models,

00:48:41.167 --> 00:48:43.067
there are still a lot
of revenue streams

00:48:43.067 --> 00:48:46.267
that can potentially
generate a lot of money.

00:48:46.267 --> 00:48:47.334
So I want to leave you guys

00:48:47.334 --> 00:48:49.501
with one more example
of applications,

00:48:49.501 --> 00:48:50.934
because what I see
is this example

00:48:50.934 --> 00:48:53.200
is kind of like a template.

00:48:53.200 --> 00:48:56.901
One single developer,
Dave,

00:48:56.901 --> 00:48:59.234
he invented this concept
of Mob War.

00:48:59.234 --> 00:49:01.868
A lot of people probably
play these kind of games.

00:49:01.868 --> 00:49:06.334
And this is actually
a clone of Mob War on Myspace.

00:49:06.334 --> 00:49:08.100
Mobster.

00:49:08.100 --> 00:49:10.033
As you can see
in this application,

00:49:10.033 --> 00:49:11.300
there are things
that I can do.

00:49:11.300 --> 00:49:13.934
I can go out
and basically be a mobster,

00:49:13.934 --> 00:49:16.467
develop my gang,
and do some jobs.

00:49:16.467 --> 00:49:18.868
In this case, like, I was doing
a collection--protection--

00:49:18.868 --> 00:49:20.334
collect protection money--

00:49:20.334 --> 00:49:22.734
just go out and collect money
for my boss.

00:49:22.734 --> 00:49:24.868
If I try to click
the button to the job,

00:49:24.868 --> 00:49:27.400
it's gently reminding me
that I'm out of energy.

00:49:27.400 --> 00:49:31.167
Or sometimes I need extra item
in order to finish that job.

00:49:31.167 --> 00:49:34.300
And I can also go out and buy
properties and earn money.

00:49:34.300 --> 00:49:35.968
There are a lot
of things you can do.

00:49:35.968 --> 00:49:38.801
But the key here is that
at the very top you can see

00:49:38.801 --> 00:49:40.467
there are three
control levels.

00:49:40.467 --> 00:49:43.100
There's the energy, health,
and then stamina.

00:49:43.100 --> 00:49:45.801
So these are the things you want
to build into your game--

00:49:45.801 --> 00:49:48.767
little levels
that will control the pace

00:49:48.767 --> 00:49:52.434
that your users can really
engage with your application.

00:49:52.434 --> 00:49:56.000
By doing that,
what'll happen is the users--

00:49:56.000 --> 00:49:58.868
some users, they want
to really get into the game

00:49:58.868 --> 00:50:02.033
and be advanced in levels,
really get into this game,

00:50:02.033 --> 00:50:04.300
and they will
buy energy in this case.

00:50:04.300 --> 00:50:06.200
They will buy health
when they get hurt

00:50:06.200 --> 00:50:08.267
in fighting
with other players.

00:50:08.267 --> 00:50:10.434
So a lot of applications
are very much like that.

00:50:10.434 --> 00:50:13.968
This is kind of a great template
that you guys can use

00:50:13.968 --> 00:50:15.701
to build levels,

00:50:15.701 --> 00:50:18.601
control the pace
of the user, their activity,

00:50:18.601 --> 00:50:21.868
so they will pay you
in those virtual goods.

00:50:21.868 --> 00:50:25.133
So we've talked about

00:50:25.133 --> 00:50:27.234
the business opportunity
in the space.

00:50:27.234 --> 00:50:29.901
We've covered the landscape
with a brief survey,

00:50:29.901 --> 00:50:34.300
and we covered
revenue streams in the space.

00:50:34.300 --> 00:50:36.534
We also talked
about the cost side,

00:50:36.534 --> 00:50:39.234
and shared some of the best
practices with you guys.

00:50:39.234 --> 00:50:42.701
And I hope it's all making
good dollars and sense for you.

00:50:42.701 --> 00:50:44.734
And with the great
Mouse Trap--

00:50:44.734 --> 00:50:47.334
a lot of great ideas I'm sure
you guys are thinking about.

00:50:47.334 --> 00:50:50.534
And combine it
with technology like OpenSocial,

00:50:50.534 --> 00:50:53.701
I hope that'll translate
into dollars for you guys.

00:50:53.701 --> 00:50:55.434
And if you are
still not convinced

00:50:55.434 --> 00:50:57.367
that this is one way
to make money,

00:50:57.367 --> 00:50:59.534
and the least I hope
is that

00:50:59.534 --> 00:51:02.100
you guys can go out
and be mobsters.

00:51:02.100 --> 00:51:03.701
Okay, thank you.

00:51:03.701 --> 00:51:05.701
With that...

00:51:05.701 --> 00:51:08.267
So this is just attribution
to some of the creative contents

00:51:08.267 --> 00:51:09.934
that I used in this talk,

00:51:09.934 --> 00:51:12.467
and some great links
we have here

00:51:12.467 --> 00:51:14.033
At the bottom,
as you can see, again,

00:51:14.033 --> 00:51:16.634
is the Google Moderator tool
that if you have questions,

00:51:16.634 --> 00:51:18.801
please submit it
or vote it there.

00:51:18.801 --> 00:51:21.033
And with that,
I'll open up for some questions.

00:51:21.033 --> 00:51:23.534
We have two mics here,
so please come to the mic

00:51:23.534 --> 00:51:27.067
so everybody can hear
the questions.

00:51:27.067 --> 00:51:28.467
Thank you.

00:51:28.467 --> 00:51:31.400
[applause]

00:51:36.400 --> 00:51:39.434
Go ahead.

00:51:39.434 --> 00:51:41.767
audience member:
I was wondering whether there is

00:51:41.767 --> 00:51:43.100
an opportunity or a place

00:51:43.100 --> 00:51:47.033
for a subscription-based
revenue model.

00:51:47.033 --> 00:51:49.901
And what would be
the implications for,

00:51:49.901 --> 00:51:52.467
for example,
the target market?

00:51:52.467 --> 00:51:55.133
More discerning users--
users would like actually

00:51:55.133 --> 00:51:58.467
to engage
in specific activity.

00:51:58.467 --> 00:52:01.634
How could this
be organized--

00:52:01.634 --> 00:52:04.601
in sense of all
the methods

00:52:04.601 --> 00:52:06.267
that have been
described here--

00:52:06.267 --> 00:52:11.334
work also
for such a model?

00:52:11.334 --> 00:52:13.968
Shen:
You want to take that?

00:52:13.968 --> 00:52:15.501
So I'm sorry,
I couldn't hear

00:52:15.501 --> 00:52:17.200
the last part of
your question.

00:52:17.200 --> 00:52:19.167
audience member:
What of the methods

00:52:19.167 --> 00:52:22.100
that you have described here
for user retention,

00:52:22.100 --> 00:52:24.501
and some of the other methods,
would work also

00:52:24.501 --> 00:52:27.167
in the subscription-based
revenue model?

00:52:27.167 --> 00:52:29.133
Capiel: Right. So yeah.

00:52:29.133 --> 00:52:31.000
So on a subscription model,
obviously it's gonna be

00:52:31.000 --> 00:52:32.334
really important
for you to retain

00:52:32.334 --> 00:52:34.767
your users as long
as possible.

00:52:34.767 --> 00:52:36.567
audience member:
Would you a little bit louder?

00:52:36.567 --> 00:52:38.601
I cannot hear at all.
Capiel: Sorry.

00:52:38.601 --> 00:52:40.467
I was saying that with
the subscription-based models...

00:52:40.467 --> 00:52:42.033
Trewhella:
Is the mic on?

00:52:42.033 --> 00:52:43.367
Capiel: It's still
a little early.

00:52:43.367 --> 00:52:45.367
We're not seeing--
at least on Myspace

00:52:45.367 --> 00:52:48.167
we're not seeing
a monitor's model out there.

00:52:48.167 --> 00:52:51.534
I have seen them with some
of the other applications.

00:52:51.534 --> 00:52:54.667
I think LinkedIn
might even have one application

00:52:54.667 --> 00:52:56.901
that has
a subscription-based model.

00:52:56.901 --> 00:53:00.834
Trewhella: Dude, you turned
your mic off, I think.

00:53:00.834 --> 00:53:03.200
Capiel: No, it's on.

00:53:03.200 --> 00:53:05.934
Well, anyway,
I'll just talk louder.

00:53:05.934 --> 00:53:08.601
So it's early to say
with subscription-based models,

00:53:08.601 --> 00:53:10.467
but I think
that they will work.

00:53:10.467 --> 00:53:13.334
There's a company called
[indistinct], I think it is,

00:53:13.334 --> 00:53:16.267
that essentially
provides technology

00:53:16.267 --> 00:53:17.334
for companies that want

00:53:17.334 --> 00:53:20.267
to develop
subscription-based models

00:53:20.267 --> 00:53:22.968
with their applications.

00:53:22.968 --> 00:53:25.601
So I don't know if
I've answered your question.

00:53:25.601 --> 00:53:27.767
There's not that much
of it out there,

00:53:27.767 --> 00:53:29.100
but I think it is an area

00:53:29.100 --> 00:53:33.234
that we'll probably
start to see more activity.

00:53:33.234 --> 00:53:34.934
Trewhella:
There are, um...

00:53:34.934 --> 00:53:36.901
There are also traditional
kind of payment gateways

00:53:36.901 --> 00:53:38.400
like DataCash
and Net Pay

00:53:38.400 --> 00:53:40.767
that will let you set up
subscription payments

00:53:40.767 --> 00:53:43.968
so you can move outside
the social network

00:53:43.968 --> 00:53:45.434
to charge the money
that way.

00:53:45.434 --> 00:53:48.434
If that's what
you wanted to do.

00:53:48.434 --> 00:53:50.467
audience member:
Okay. Thanks.

00:53:50.467 --> 00:53:52.400
Shen: Okay. Thank you.
Go ahead.

00:53:52.400 --> 00:53:53.567
audience member: Hi.

00:53:53.567 --> 00:53:56.000
Chewy, I think,
mentioned...

00:53:56.000 --> 00:53:58.601
This is a legal question.

00:53:58.601 --> 00:54:04.267
So I guess for the E.U.
there are more restrictive...

00:54:04.267 --> 00:54:06.200
there are more restrictions
on privacy and things like that.

00:54:06.200 --> 00:54:07.701
How do you sort of--

00:54:07.701 --> 00:54:09.501
You don't have control
about who's coming to your site,

00:54:09.501 --> 00:54:12.400
so do you simply sort of choose
the most restrictive regime,

00:54:12.400 --> 00:54:16.167
or how do you keep
from running afoul of privacy

00:54:16.167 --> 00:54:17.367
and laws and things
like that?

00:54:17.367 --> 00:54:18.601
Trewhella: I mean,
it's gonna depend

00:54:18.601 --> 00:54:19.868
on the network
you're deployed on as well.

00:54:19.868 --> 00:54:22.067
So different networks
will have different rules.

00:54:22.067 --> 00:54:25.234
But, I mean, you can
set up your users

00:54:25.234 --> 00:54:28.834
to agree to a standard ULA
under, say, U.S. law,

00:54:28.834 --> 00:54:30.033
and then anyone
who's coming in

00:54:30.033 --> 00:54:32.133
is just restricted
by whatever terms you set.

00:54:32.133 --> 00:54:33.834
So you don't have to worry
about setting it up

00:54:33.834 --> 00:54:36.267
for each country
that everyone might come from.

00:54:36.267 --> 00:54:37.834
Because someone
subscribing to your app,

00:54:37.834 --> 00:54:39.767
because they're agreeing
to the terms and conditions,

00:54:39.767 --> 00:54:41.667
they're agreeing
under the law that you define.

00:54:41.667 --> 00:54:43.567
I mean, I'm not a lawyer,
so don't take that as read.

00:54:43.567 --> 00:54:45.133
You'll probably want
to confirm that with a lawyer,

00:54:45.133 --> 00:54:46.434
but certainly, like,
a lot of our services

00:54:46.434 --> 00:54:47.834
will launch in the States,

00:54:47.834 --> 00:54:49.267
and people from other
countries can come

00:54:49.267 --> 00:54:51.367
as long as they agree
to a U.S. law agreement,

00:54:51.367 --> 00:54:56.901
they're free to use them.

00:54:56.901 --> 00:54:59.934
[chuckles] We--So, um--
No, it's fine.

00:54:59.934 --> 00:55:01.501
For legal--

00:55:01.501 --> 00:55:04.367
So if you've got people coming
in from other jurisdictions,

00:55:04.367 --> 00:55:05.734
which restrict--

00:55:05.734 --> 00:55:08.701
or which privacy laws
do you choose to go with?

00:55:08.701 --> 00:55:11.067
Capiel: Um, I mean,
I think you can--

00:55:11.067 --> 00:55:13.300
the social network
is gonna have

00:55:13.300 --> 00:55:15.501
some pretty clear
guidelines by itself

00:55:15.501 --> 00:55:17.667
in terms of,
you know, how--

00:55:17.667 --> 00:55:21.501
what privacy constraints
you have to work within.

00:55:21.501 --> 00:55:23.968
And usually that social network,
like Myspace,

00:55:23.968 --> 00:55:25.968
is operating
in multiple countries.

00:55:25.968 --> 00:55:29.868
Then they will have actually
set up a privacy policy

00:55:29.868 --> 00:55:33.334
that's applicable
across regions.

00:55:33.334 --> 00:55:36.367
So you should be covered,
but that said, you know,

00:55:36.367 --> 00:55:37.667
I wouldn't--
I think if you have

00:55:37.667 --> 00:55:38.934
any kind of
substantial business,

00:55:38.934 --> 00:55:41.133
I would encourage you
to kind of

00:55:41.133 --> 00:55:46.667
check your own
privacy policy as well.

00:55:46.667 --> 00:55:48.300
Shen: Okay,
let me just take one--

00:55:48.300 --> 00:55:50.601
There's one question
on the Moderator tool.

00:55:50.601 --> 00:55:53.601
I think it's probably
how [indistinct]

00:55:53.601 --> 00:55:55.167
used OpenSocial
on his Web site,

00:55:55.167 --> 00:55:56.267
probably like GFC.

00:55:56.267 --> 00:55:58.400
You wanna say something
about GFC?

00:55:58.400 --> 00:55:59.934
Trewhella: Yeah, so I mean
OpenSocial is more

00:55:59.934 --> 00:56:02.634
about building an application
to put on a social network.

00:56:02.634 --> 00:56:04.133
We have another product
called Friend Connect.

00:56:04.133 --> 00:56:05.901
And there's some Friend Connect
dudes sitting right there.

00:56:05.901 --> 00:56:07.033
Wave your hands
in the air.

00:56:07.033 --> 00:56:08.834
Shen: The talk earlier
is Friend Connect.

00:56:08.834 --> 00:56:10.934
Trewhella: And that's
the idea of taking people--

00:56:10.934 --> 00:56:13.467
or taking the social graph
of an existing social network

00:56:13.467 --> 00:56:15.267
and deploying it
onto your Web site.

00:56:15.267 --> 00:56:16.667
There's a couple of ways
you can do that.

00:56:16.667 --> 00:56:18.267
There's some cut and paste code,
so it's as simple as

00:56:18.267 --> 00:56:21.868
putting a YouTube video onto
your Web site to integrate that.

00:56:21.868 --> 00:56:23.434
But there's also
a much deeper integration.

00:56:23.434 --> 00:56:28.467
You can start to talk
directly to the social sites

00:56:28.467 --> 00:56:30.300
with [indistinct]
interfaces.

00:56:30.300 --> 00:56:31.901
Kind of do a much
deeper-level integration.

00:56:31.901 --> 00:56:32.901
These guys can
help out with that.

00:56:32.901 --> 00:56:34.567
There was a talk
just before this

00:56:34.567 --> 00:56:36.934
that if you check out on YouTube
tomorrow you can have a look.

00:56:36.934 --> 00:56:39.968
And also
code.google.com/friendconnect.

00:56:39.968 --> 00:56:41.267
Shen: We're running
a little late.

00:56:41.267 --> 00:56:42.734
One more question
from Loren.

00:56:42.734 --> 00:56:44.100
Loren: Hi.
Just a question about--

00:56:44.100 --> 00:56:46.367
So it's been hammered into us
over the last two days,

00:56:46.367 --> 00:56:47.667
look at metrics,
look at metrics,

00:56:47.667 --> 00:56:48.734
look at metrics.

00:56:48.734 --> 00:56:50.701
So the quantitative part
is important.

00:56:50.701 --> 00:56:52.434
But if I'm looking
at A/B testing, right?

00:56:52.434 --> 00:56:55.234
And I look and I say
A has much better conversion,

00:56:55.234 --> 00:56:57.868
but I really want B because
maybe it's a payment method

00:56:57.868 --> 00:56:59.434
that's really,
really cheap,

00:56:59.434 --> 00:57:02.868
and I'd like to ask questions
about why they chose A over B,

00:57:02.868 --> 00:57:04.701
I can go to my community,
and that's good,

00:57:04.701 --> 00:57:06.367
but is there some way,
in your experience,

00:57:06.367 --> 00:57:08.200
when you guys have
worked with, you know,

00:57:08.200 --> 00:57:10.767
either as the developer
advocates or as Myspace,

00:57:10.767 --> 00:57:12.367
you've worked with people
that have been able

00:57:12.367 --> 00:57:15.501
to somehow reach out to that
population that's chosen A

00:57:15.501 --> 00:57:17.100
and been able to ask them
qualitative questions

00:57:17.100 --> 00:57:20.033
in a light way where you get
a little more input about,

00:57:20.033 --> 00:57:22.200
you know, having more control
over what happens

00:57:22.200 --> 00:57:23.868
once you have that data?

00:57:23.868 --> 00:57:26.033
Shen: Yeah, yeah.
Absolutely have a great point.

00:57:26.033 --> 00:57:28.067
I always--
I mean, metric is one thing.

00:57:28.067 --> 00:57:32.234
I always go with some anecdotes,
and to confirm the numbers,

00:57:32.234 --> 00:57:34.901
because numbers--
they tell you the picture

00:57:34.901 --> 00:57:37.033
maybe without
the story behind it.

00:57:37.033 --> 00:57:38.367
But that's a great point.

00:57:38.367 --> 00:57:39.634
You have anything to add?

00:57:39.634 --> 00:57:41.634
Capiel: Yeah, I mean,
I know our best developers

00:57:41.634 --> 00:57:44.501
definitely have, like,
a committee forums area

00:57:44.501 --> 00:57:48.634
where they can actually
interact in a qualitative way

00:57:48.634 --> 00:57:51.033
with users and kind of
learn those things,

00:57:51.033 --> 00:57:55.501
so I think, you know,
you would be wise to kind of

00:57:55.501 --> 00:57:57.934
make sure there's
an easy way for users

00:57:57.934 --> 00:58:00.234
to contact you
and ask questions.

00:58:00.234 --> 00:58:01.667
And that's a place where

00:58:01.667 --> 00:58:04.033
you can engage
and kind of talk to them

00:58:04.033 --> 00:58:05.334
and understand,
you know,

00:58:05.334 --> 00:58:09.000
why something may work
and may not work for them

00:58:09.000 --> 00:58:11.133
besides what
the numbers tell you.

00:58:11.133 --> 00:58:13.767
Trewhella: One other thing
I'd add is that

00:58:13.767 --> 00:58:16.334
because you're putting an
application on a social network,

00:58:16.334 --> 00:58:18.501
you immediately know
who these people are, right?

00:58:18.501 --> 00:58:21.567
So you can say, well,
we've got choice A and choice B,

00:58:21.567 --> 00:58:23.300
90% of people
go for choice A,

00:58:23.300 --> 00:58:25.000
let's look at
the 10% who chose B,

00:58:25.000 --> 00:58:28.100
get their e-mail addresses,
and just say,

00:58:28.100 --> 00:58:29.667
"Hey, why did you pick B?"

00:58:29.667 --> 00:58:31.100
Shen: Great. Okay.

00:58:31.100 --> 00:58:32.734
Since we're running over,
thank you again for coming,

00:58:32.734 --> 00:58:35.200
and enjoy the lunch now.

00:58:35.200 --> 00:58:36.467
Thank you.

00:58:36.467 --> 00:58:37.567
[applause]
