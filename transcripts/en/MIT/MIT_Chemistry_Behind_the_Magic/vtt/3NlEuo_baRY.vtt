[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:07.767 --> 00:00:09.100
JESSICA HARROP: Hi, I'm Jessica.

00:00:09.100 --> 00:00:11.516
And I'm going to be talking
about a chemical demonstration

00:00:11.516 --> 00:00:16.090
today that I like to call
bringin' home the bacon.

00:00:16.090 --> 00:00:18.220
Now, before we get
cooking let's take a look

00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:20.300
at the chemist's best friend.

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:22.510
This is the periodic table.

00:00:22.510 --> 00:00:26.460
It was created in 1869 by
the Russian chemist Dmitri

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:31.030
Mendeleev back when only
65 elements were known.

00:00:31.030 --> 00:00:32.770
Different elements
on the periodic table

00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:36.310
require different numbers
of electrons to be happy.

00:00:36.310 --> 00:00:39.700
Electrons live in the
shells surrounding atoms.

00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:43.400
And when an atom's outermost
shell is filled to capacity,

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:45.100
the atom is happy.

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:50.370
Now hydrogen, over here, has
one electron in its outer shell

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:53.110
and needs just one
more to fill it.

00:00:53.110 --> 00:00:56.650
Carbon has four electrons
in its outer shell

00:00:56.650 --> 00:01:00.970
and needs four more, a total
of eight electrons, to fill it.

00:01:00.970 --> 00:01:04.599
Now on the left and middle of
the table, we have the metals.

00:01:04.599 --> 00:01:07.060
To get to eight electrons
in their outer shell,

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:09.440
the metals lose electrons.

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:12.670
And on the right side of the
table, we have nonmetals.

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:16.480
To get to eight electrons,
these elements gain electrons.

00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:18.460
And hydrogen is
the only nonmetal

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:21.920
that's on the left hand
side of the periodic table.

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:24.940
Now one way atoms get eight
electrons in their outer shell

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:26.770
is through chemical bonds.

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:30.800
A bond is the sharing of two
electrons between two atoms.

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:32.530
So carbon likes to
have four bonds.

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:35.020
And hydrogen likes to have one.

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:37.090
Knowing about where
the electrons are

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:39.280
and how they
participate in bonding

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:42.770
is central to many important
things in the real world.

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:45.850
For example, unsaturated
fats have a double bond,

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:47.230
lots of electrons.

00:01:47.230 --> 00:01:49.790
And that gives them
special reactivity,

00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:51.580
which can lead to
the spoiling of food

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:53.927
when the bonds
react with oxygen.

00:01:53.927 --> 00:01:56.260
So we like to know if there
are double bonds in our food

00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:57.280
molecules.

00:01:57.280 --> 00:01:59.770
But how is that determined?

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:04.510
So this is what a happy carbon
hydrogen molecule looks like.

00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:07.690
But in some cases, there are
not enough hydrogen atoms.

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:09.400
And the carbon will
have to double bond

00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:13.900
with another carbon
to share electrons.

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:17.620
This molecule is more
reactive than this one

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:19.780
because a carbon-carbon
double bond is not

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:23.720
as stable as a
carbon-carbon single bond.

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:26.260
Now let's watch as
MIT's Dr. John Dolhun

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:29.230
uses bromine to test for
the presence of double bonds

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:31.240
in a big ol' slab of bacon.

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:33.520
Here he is at the
Cambridge Science Festival.

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:34.230
[WHOOSH]

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:36.271
JOHN DOLHUN: I'm going to
trun on my burner here.

00:02:42.210 --> 00:02:43.110
OK, there we go.

00:02:50.660 --> 00:03:03.704
So I'm going to take
my bacon, the fat.

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:14.010
Basically shake it up a bit.

00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:21.530
You can see the red color of
the bromine is going away.

00:03:27.991 --> 00:03:28.990
[WHOOSH]

00:03:28.990 --> 00:03:33.730
JESSICA HARROP: So Dr. Dolhun
heats up a piece of bacon

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:35.965
and adds it to a flask
filled with bromine.

00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:42.310
Bromine reacts with
anything that has

00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:44.260
a carbon-carbon double bond.

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:45.970
This includes the
acrolein that's

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:52.120
produced when you cook
bacon, which looks like this,

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:54.130
as well as the
unsaturated fat that's

00:03:54.130 --> 00:03:56.650
already present in the bacon.

00:03:56.650 --> 00:03:58.750
Unsaturated fats
are fats that have

00:03:58.750 --> 00:04:02.570
carbon-carbon double bonds.

00:04:02.570 --> 00:04:06.320
Fully saturated fats have no
carbon-carbon double bonds.

00:04:06.320 --> 00:04:08.690
They're all carbon-carbon
single bonds.

00:04:08.690 --> 00:04:11.150
And they're the ones
that are bad for you.

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:13.490
The breaking of the double
bond looks like this.

00:04:17.529 --> 00:04:20.220
We can tell that the reaction
happens because the red color

00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:21.390
disappears.

00:04:21.390 --> 00:04:24.480
That's the bromine reacting
with those carbon-carbon double

00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:26.280
bonds.

00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:28.390
In our video recording
of the experiment,

00:04:28.390 --> 00:04:30.190
it's hard to see
the color change.

00:04:30.190 --> 00:04:32.130
So watch again very closely.

00:04:32.130 --> 00:04:50.346
[WHOOSH]

00:04:50.346 --> 00:04:51.470
Hope you enjoyed the video.

00:04:51.470 --> 00:04:52.095
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:04:52.095 --> 00:04:53.840
I'll see you next time.
