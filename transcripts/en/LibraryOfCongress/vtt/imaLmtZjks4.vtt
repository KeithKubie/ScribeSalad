&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington, D.C.

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:10.410
&gt;&gt; Please, welcome to the
stage Mr. David McCollough

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:14.510
and Mr. David Rubenstein.

00:00:14.510 --> 00:00:59.080
[ Applause ]

00:00:59.080 --> 00:01:00.910
&gt;&gt; Thank you, then.

00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:02.700 position:56%
&gt;&gt; David Rubenstein: David, you were

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:05.570
at our first national book
festival, the very first one.

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:08.750
How many people here were
at the first one, anybody?

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:11.200
How many have been to every one?

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:14.070
How many this is the first time?

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:18.510
Okay. How many people like
the price of admission?

00:01:18.510 --> 00:01:22.040
[ Applause ]

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:24.230
So we're very honored
to have David McCollough

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:27.160
and let me just give you a
brief background of David.

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:35.000
David is a native of Pittsburgh,
grew up as one of four boys

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:41.780
in a family, where his father had
a small electrical supply company,

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:45.520
not quite General Electric
but very impressive you said.

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:51.360
David went to Yale, where he did
quite well, graduated in 1955.

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:55.370
He then went to New
York, did not go back

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:58.110
to Pittsburgh despite his
parent's interest in his doing so,

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:00.360
went to New York, joined
"Sports Illustrated,"

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:05.630 position:56%
which was then a novice, new
publication and then ultimately came

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:09.880
to work in Washington at the
USIA., and while at the USIA,

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:13.570
got interested in something that
he was interested in from his time

00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:17.150
in Pittsburgh at Johnstown Flood
and then wrote his first book

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:20.170
about the Johnstown flood,
which was a bestseller,

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:23.190
that was his first book.

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:25.850
He has now written, with this book
we're going to talk about today,

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:28.750
with "The American Spirit,"
he's now written 11 book.

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:30.200
He is now working on
his twelfth book,

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:32.090
which we'll talk about shortly.

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:35.120
Every single one of
his books is still

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:37.720
in print, which is very unusual.

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:40.950
His first book is now
almost fifty years old.

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:47.070
[ Applause ]

00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:49.750
David, has won the Pulitzer
Prize twice for his books

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:51.270
on Harry Truman and John Adams.

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:53.770
He has won National
Book Prize twice.

00:02:53.770 --> 00:02:56.070
He has been given the
presidential medal

00:02:56.070 --> 00:02:57.550
of freedom by President Clinton.

00:02:57.550 --> 00:03:00.500
He has been asked to speak to
a joint session of Congress

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:03.540
and given virtually every
honor a citizen can give.

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:08.720
He's been also give 55 honorary
degrees, which must be a record.

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:13.560
So that's very impressive, but
even more impressive is he has five

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:18.180
children, 19 grandchildren
and the love of his life,

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:20.640
Rosalie, his wife of 63 years.

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:22.940
Where's Rosalie?

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:32.040
[ Applause ]

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:39.300
Okay. So did you ever think when
you were growing up in Pittsburgh

00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:41.980
that you would one day become
the most famous chronicler

00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:43.500
of American History?

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:44.800
&gt;&gt; David McCollough: Of course.

00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:46.100
&gt;&gt; David Rubenstein: You did?

00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:47.400
&gt;&gt; David McCollough: No.

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:50.570
I never imagined such a thing.

00:03:50.570 --> 00:03:51.870
&gt;&gt; David Rubenstein:
What was your ambition

00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:53.170
as a young boy in Pittsburgh?

00:03:53.170 --> 00:03:54.880
What did you want to do?

00:03:54.880 --> 00:03:58.960
&gt;&gt; David McCollough: I wanted to
get good grades in school but not

00:03:58.960 --> 00:04:01.780
to spend too much of my
time worrying about that

00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:06.320
and then I got interested
in girls and took out a lot

00:04:06.320 --> 00:04:10.170
of my thought and preparations.

00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:15.400
And once I got to college,
I knew that I either wanted

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:25.090
to be an artist, or a writer,
or an architect, or an actor,

00:04:25.090 --> 00:04:28.450
but I couldn't make up my mind.

00:04:28.450 --> 00:04:31.830
So when I finished college, I
thought, "I know what I'll do.

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:34.480
I'll go to New York
and see what happens."

00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:36.650
So I went to New York
and a lot happened.

00:04:36.650 --> 00:04:38.280
&gt;&gt; David Rubenstein: Now, did
your family say, go to New York,

00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:39.680
or did they say come
back to Pittsburgh?

00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:40.980
&gt;&gt; Oh, no.

00:04:40.980 --> 00:04:42.920
My father would call
me after my second

00:04:42.920 --> 00:04:46.010 position:56%
or third book had been published, he
said, "Well, now it's time for you

00:04:46.010 --> 00:04:50.220
to come back to Pittsburgh
and get a real job."

00:04:50.220 --> 00:04:55.100
He never understood but I'd go
back to Pittsburgh all the time

00:04:55.100 --> 00:05:01.630 position:56%
and I'm very grateful I grew up when
I did then at that time in that city

00:05:01.630 --> 00:05:06.630
and it was a lesson
in history, in itself.

00:05:06.630 --> 00:05:12.900
It was a simulation for the
Arts and the literature,

00:05:12.900 --> 00:05:17.310
the principal by school,
leading the public school,

00:05:17.310 --> 00:05:22.360
was one of the founders of the
first PBS station in America,

00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:25.030
Carolyn [phonetically
spelled] D. Patterson

00:05:25.030 --> 00:05:32.310 position:56%
and KDKA was the first radio
station in America and I was invited

00:05:32.310 --> 00:05:37.660
to do a little voice over for KDKA
when I was still in high school,

00:05:37.660 --> 00:05:40.170
so that interested me too.

00:05:40.170 --> 00:05:42.250
&gt;&gt; David Rubenstein: So yo
went to "Sports Illustrated."

00:05:42.250 --> 00:05:46.030
That isn't American History
exactly, a very nice publication,

00:05:46.030 --> 00:05:48.320
but what did you work on there?

00:05:48.320 --> 00:05:49.620
&gt;&gt; David McCollough: Well, I worked

00:05:49.620 --> 00:05:54.420
in the circulation
promotion department

00:05:54.420 --> 00:06:00.100
and we had these test
mailers, as they called them,

00:06:00.100 --> 00:06:03.740
where they would four or
five different letters

00:06:03.740 --> 00:06:09.150
to people asking them to take an
interest in this new magazine,

00:06:09.150 --> 00:06:16.080
and I asked if I could contribute a
competitor in the test, and I told,

00:06:16.080 --> 00:06:18.750
"Yes, but you have to
do it on your own time.

00:06:18.750 --> 00:06:25.860
Don't waste office time doing this"
a ten-year job, I was a trainee.

00:06:25.860 --> 00:06:30.150
So I wrote the letter and
submitted it and they decided

00:06:30.150 --> 00:06:32.470
to use it, and it won the test.

00:06:32.470 --> 00:06:37.690
From that point on,
I was looking good.

00:06:37.690 --> 00:06:40.530
But the wonderful thing
about it was the

00:06:40.530 --> 00:06:44.760
"Sports Illustrated" was brand
new, and nobody really knew exactly

00:06:44.760 --> 00:06:47.180
where it was going
or how to make it go.

00:06:47.180 --> 00:06:51.080
It was a very exciting
time and the whole spirit

00:06:51.080 --> 00:06:54.620
of the city then was amazing.

00:06:54.620 --> 00:06:57.850
I went to work for
5000 dollars a year.

00:06:57.850 --> 00:07:06.040 position:56%
They allowed me an extra ten dollars
a week because I was married.

00:07:06.040 --> 00:07:11.210
The stereotype for women was not
just in salaries, it was expressed

00:07:11.210 --> 00:07:15.920
in other ways too, but I also found
right away how many wonderful there

00:07:15.920 --> 00:07:20.000
were working there and later
when I came to Washington,

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:22.010
I found some of the
best people I had worked

00:07:22.010 --> 00:07:25.730
with in my life were the women
at the U.S. Information Agency.

00:07:25.730 --> 00:07:32.480
What happened when Kennedy ran, I
thought this is really exciting.

00:07:32.480 --> 00:07:33.900
He was going to make a difference.

00:07:33.900 --> 00:07:37.230
He was going to give us
all a chance to take part,

00:07:37.230 --> 00:07:41.780
and when he gave his magnificent
inaugural address and said,

00:07:41.780 --> 00:07:45.290
"Do not ask what your country
can for you but what you can do

00:07:45.290 --> 00:07:47.890
for your country,"
I took that entirely

00:07:47.890 --> 00:07:51.710
to heart, and I quit my job.

00:07:51.710 --> 00:07:53.580
I knew no one in the Kennedy crowd,

00:07:53.580 --> 00:07:56.230
I knew no one in the
government here.

00:07:56.230 --> 00:08:00.180
I came down and went door to
door looking for some place

00:08:00.180 --> 00:08:02.840
in the federal government
where my training

00:08:02.840 --> 00:08:06.870
and my education would be
appropriate and wound up,

00:08:06.870 --> 00:08:11.930
luck would have it, and luck is a
big factor not just in our lives

00:08:11.930 --> 00:08:16.310
but in history -- it's not
sufficiently paid attention to,

00:08:16.310 --> 00:08:20.070
but as luck would have it, I
wound up working at the USIA

00:08:20.070 --> 00:08:25.010
when Kennedy had appointed Edward
R. Murrow to be the director,

00:08:25.010 --> 00:08:27.490
so it was a very exciting time.

00:08:27.490 --> 00:08:30.880
It stayed an exciting
time for the three years

00:08:30.880 --> 00:08:36.560
until the president was killed, but
during that time, I happen to be

00:08:36.560 --> 00:08:38.860
in the Library in Congress
doing some research

00:08:38.860 --> 00:08:41.570
for some articles we
were going to include

00:08:41.570 --> 00:08:47.450
in the magazine I was editing
and chanced upon this big table

00:08:47.450 --> 00:08:51.090
at the library in the
Princeton photograph's division

00:08:51.090 --> 00:08:54.520
of photographs taken
at Johnstown right

00:08:54.520 --> 00:08:59.100
after the famous disastrous
flood of 1889.

00:08:59.100 --> 00:09:02.290
And I had heard about the flood all
my life but I really knew nothing

00:09:02.290 --> 00:09:04.400
about it and I looked
at those photographs

00:09:04.400 --> 00:09:08.990
and saw the devastating destruction
and couldn't believe my life

00:09:08.990 --> 00:09:12.360
and I thought, "What happened?"

00:09:12.360 --> 00:09:16.360
So I took a book out of
the library, which was okay

00:09:16.360 --> 00:09:19.770
but the author didn't really
understand the geography

00:09:19.770 --> 00:09:23.180
of western Pennsylvania,
which I did understand.

00:09:23.180 --> 00:09:25.210
So I took another book
out of the library

00:09:25.210 --> 00:09:27.750
and it was pot boiler
written at the time,

00:09:27.750 --> 00:09:31.430
full of inaccuracies and so forth.

00:09:31.430 --> 00:09:36.780
But while I was in college, I had
the good fortune to cross paths

00:09:36.780 --> 00:09:41.720
with Thorn Wilder, the great
playwright and novelist,

00:09:41.720 --> 00:09:47.990
and he was asked, at one point,
why do you write the plays you do,

00:09:47.990 --> 00:09:51.800
the subjects you choose, why
do you write the novels you do

00:09:51.800 --> 00:09:53.420
and subjects you choose?

00:09:53.420 --> 00:09:57.630
He said, "I imagine a story
that I'd like to be able to read

00:09:57.630 --> 00:10:02.940
and if I find nobody's written it
so I can see it on stage or read it

00:10:02.940 --> 00:10:07.590
in a book, I write it myself
so I can read it in a book

00:10:07.590 --> 00:10:12.950
or see it performed on stage
and I thought, why don't you try

00:10:12.950 --> 00:10:14.610
and write the book you
wish you could read

00:10:14.610 --> 00:10:16.790
about the Johnstown flood?

00:10:16.790 --> 00:10:20.720
And I soon as I started working
on that book, here at the Library

00:10:20.720 --> 00:10:24.080
of Congress, primarily, I
knew this is what I want

00:10:24.080 --> 00:10:25.430
to do for the rest of my life?

00:10:25.430 --> 00:10:28.280
&gt;&gt; David Rubenstein: So did
you quit your job at USIA?

00:10:28.280 --> 00:10:29.580
&gt;&gt; David McCollough: I did not.

00:10:29.580 --> 00:10:33.460 position:56%
When Kennedy was killed, I was asked
to come back to New York to work

00:10:33.460 --> 00:10:37.020 position:56%
at "American Heritage," the
wonderful American History magazine,

00:10:37.020 --> 00:10:41.840
which was then published with
hard covers and no advertising.

00:10:41.840 --> 00:10:43.410
Bruce Catton was the editor.

00:10:43.410 --> 00:10:48.890
It was an exciting, marvelous and
adventurous time and I worked there

00:10:48.890 --> 00:10:54.520
for six years, and I wrote
"The Johnstown Flood" on nights

00:10:54.520 --> 00:11:00.880
and on weekends for three years,
carrying on my job as usual

00:11:00.880 --> 00:11:07.410
but after I had written the book
and then I after I got the idea

00:11:07.410 --> 00:11:12.360
for the next book on building
the Brooklyn Bridge, I thought,

00:11:12.360 --> 00:11:16.240
"I got to quit and see if
I can do it full-time,"

00:11:16.240 --> 00:11:18.330
and because I was married
and married

00:11:18.330 --> 00:11:21.510
to a very brave, wonderful woman --

00:11:21.510 --> 00:11:25.110
[ Applause ]

00:11:25.110 --> 00:11:28.110
-- she said, "If that's what
you want to do, we'll do it."

00:11:28.110 --> 00:11:29.860
We had no outside income.

00:11:29.860 --> 00:11:33.170
All we had was an advanced
on the new book,

00:11:33.170 --> 00:11:38.180
and after my Johnstown
book was published,

00:11:38.180 --> 00:11:41.420
several other publishers came
to me and one of them wanted me

00:11:41.420 --> 00:11:49.850
to do the Chicago Fire and the
other the San Francisco earthquake.

00:11:49.850 --> 00:11:53.670
So I was hardly 30 years old and
I was already being type casted

00:11:53.670 --> 00:11:58.220
as "bad news McCollough"
and I didn't want that.

00:11:58.220 --> 00:12:03.870
I wanted a symbol of affirmation,
a symbol of positive affirmation

00:12:03.870 --> 00:12:07.420
and I must say it took me a
while to come up with the idea.

00:12:07.420 --> 00:12:09.120
People say, "Where do
you get your ideas?"

00:12:09.120 --> 00:12:15.120
I get them from all over the
place and I was having lunch

00:12:15.120 --> 00:12:20.580
with two friends, one was a science
writer, the other an engineer.

00:12:20.580 --> 00:12:26.070
They started talking about
all that the builders

00:12:26.070 --> 00:12:29.800 position:56%
of the Brooklyn Bridge didn't know
they were in for when they first set

00:12:29.800 --> 00:12:34.080
out to do it and I thought,
"There's my subject."

00:12:34.080 --> 00:12:37.060
I came out of that lunch.

00:12:37.060 --> 00:12:39.830
It was down on the lower
eastside, and I went to straight

00:12:39.830 --> 00:12:47.030 position:56%
to the New York Public Library, the
marble stairs to the card catalog --

00:12:47.030 --> 00:12:53.300
the old card catalog days -- and
pulled out the draw and there were

00:12:53.300 --> 00:12:58.180
over 50 cards on the subject
of the Brooklyn Bridge

00:12:58.180 --> 00:13:03.750 position:56%
but not one describing a book of the
kind I intended already to write.

00:13:03.750 --> 00:13:05.280
And I knew this is it.

00:13:05.280 --> 00:13:11.400 position:56%
So it was on the basis of that idea
and the willingness of my publisher,

00:13:11.400 --> 00:13:15.640
Simon and Schuster, to go behind
me and give me an advance,

00:13:15.640 --> 00:13:20.310
that I was able to
stop working full-time.

00:13:20.310 --> 00:13:24.330
And I've never changed publishers.

00:13:24.330 --> 00:13:28.930
Simon and Schuster have published
all my books and I always figured

00:13:28.930 --> 00:13:32.100
if I was loyal and faithful
to them, they would be to me

00:13:32.100 --> 00:13:33.420
and they certainly have been.

00:13:33.420 --> 00:13:35.920
&gt;&gt; David Rubenstein: One wife
and one publisher for 63 years.

00:13:35.920 --> 00:13:40.650
&gt;&gt; David McCollough: One
wife and one publisher.

00:13:40.650 --> 00:13:41.950
&gt;&gt; David Rubenstein:
You might describe,

00:13:41.950 --> 00:13:44.410
as you might describe
elsewhere, your style of writing

00:13:44.410 --> 00:13:48.720
because it's a little unique in the
sense that your wife is involved

00:13:48.720 --> 00:13:51.750
in the process of helping
you with the writing.

00:13:51.750 --> 00:13:54.380
Can you describe how you do that?

00:13:54.380 --> 00:13:59.660 position:56%
&gt;&gt; David McCollough: Well, I've been
confessing to this truth more lately

00:13:59.660 --> 00:14:04.580
than before but I don't
consider myself an historian.

00:14:04.580 --> 00:14:06.190
I have no degree in History.

00:14:06.190 --> 00:14:07.490
I have no PhD.

00:14:07.490 --> 00:14:09.430
I didn't major in History.

00:14:09.430 --> 00:14:11.200
I majored in English.

00:14:11.200 --> 00:14:15.840
I only took the History
courses that were required

00:14:15.840 --> 00:14:19.610
and I've always believed that one
ought to write for the ear as well

00:14:19.610 --> 00:14:23.350
as the eye; all the great did
it, Dickens and all the others

00:14:23.350 --> 00:14:27.990
because when you hear what you've
written, you begin to hear words

00:14:27.990 --> 00:14:29.570
that you're using too often.

00:14:29.570 --> 00:14:34.920
You begin to hear sentence
structures that become repetitious

00:14:34.920 --> 00:14:41.990
and you hear when you are
starting to be boring and I had two

00:14:41.990 --> 00:14:45.560
or three wonderful writers help
me along the way, Conrad Richter,

00:14:45.560 --> 00:14:50.350
the great novelist, whose work
is really beyond imagining,

00:14:50.350 --> 00:14:58.130
still Paul Horgan, wonderful
writer and Charlton Ogburn,

00:14:58.130 --> 00:15:01.430
I don't know if any of you know his
work, a brilliant, wonderful band,

00:15:01.430 --> 00:15:06.630 position:56%
and writer, and nationalist and they
helped me a great deal understand

00:15:06.630 --> 00:15:08.420
you have to cut back.

00:15:08.420 --> 00:15:10.360
you have write and rewrite.

00:15:10.360 --> 00:15:11.660
I'm not a writer.

00:15:11.660 --> 00:15:15.220
I'm a rewriter and all the
best of them had been that way.

00:15:15.220 --> 00:15:20.890
Rosalie reads everything
that I write to me out loud

00:15:20.890 --> 00:15:25.470
and she sometimes reads a
chapter three or four times

00:15:25.470 --> 00:15:29.420
because I'm rewriting
it three or fours.

00:15:29.420 --> 00:15:31.860
When we were working on my book

00:15:31.860 --> 00:15:36.510
about Theodore Roosevelt
-- may I tell this story?

00:15:36.510 --> 00:15:40.040
[ Laughter ]

00:15:40.040 --> 00:15:42.570
-- we were in the next to
the last chapter, I think,

00:15:42.570 --> 00:15:44.670
and she was reading
aloud and she just said,

00:15:44.670 --> 00:15:46.730
"There's something wrong
with that sentence."

00:15:46.730 --> 00:15:50.340
I said, "Well, read it again."

00:15:50.340 --> 00:15:51.640
She read it again.

00:15:51.640 --> 00:15:53.640
I said, "No, there's nothing
wrong with that sentence."

00:15:53.640 --> 00:15:55.770
She said, "Yes, there is."

00:15:55.770 --> 00:15:57.290
I said, "Give me."

00:15:57.290 --> 00:16:00.380
I read it aloud to her.

00:16:00.380 --> 00:16:01.680
I said, "See?"

00:16:01.680 --> 00:16:03.030
She said, "No, there's something
wrong with that sentence."

00:16:03.030 --> 00:16:07.300
I said, "Just keep going, please."

00:16:07.300 --> 00:16:11.160
Well, she kept going and I didn't
do anything about that sentence

00:16:11.160 --> 00:16:13.560
and the book went to the publisher.

00:16:13.560 --> 00:16:16.450
The publisher published
it and it came out.

00:16:16.450 --> 00:16:20.260
It got wonderful reviews
including a very fine review

00:16:20.260 --> 00:16:25.900
in the New York Review of Books
by [inaudible], up until he was

00:16:25.900 --> 00:16:29.140
about to end the review, he
said "Sometimes, however,

00:16:29.140 --> 00:16:35.850
Mr. McCollough doesn't write very
well, consider this sentence --

00:16:37.510 --> 00:16:45.130
[ Laughter ]

00:16:45.130 --> 00:16:48.200
&gt;&gt; David Rubenstein:
Some historians do a lot

00:16:48.200 --> 00:16:50.460
of research and then they write.

00:16:50.460 --> 00:16:52.180
You perhaps do something different.

00:16:52.180 --> 00:16:54.150
You research and write,
research and write.

00:16:54.150 --> 00:16:56.140
Can you describe why
you do it that way?

00:16:56.140 --> 00:16:58.760
&gt;&gt; Well, for one thing,
I never undertake a book

00:16:58.760 --> 00:17:01.540
about a subject I know much about.

00:17:01.540 --> 00:17:03.870
If I knew all about it, I
wouldn't want to write the book

00:17:03.870 --> 00:17:09.500
because the search process would
not be an adventure, and, for me,

00:17:09.500 --> 00:17:12.220
each subject I undertake
is a new experience.

00:17:12.220 --> 00:17:16.100 position:56%
I'm setting foot on a continent I've
never been to before and working

00:17:16.100 --> 00:17:22.820
on a detective case, and I really
don't know much about the research

00:17:22.820 --> 00:17:26.630
for the last half of the book and
I don't want to know that yet.

00:17:26.630 --> 00:17:28.430
I want to be involved
with the people

00:17:28.430 --> 00:17:30.110
who were involved in the story.

00:17:30.110 --> 00:17:32.080
I want to be with them.

00:17:32.080 --> 00:17:33.380
I want to know them.

00:17:33.380 --> 00:17:35.150
I want to be inside their time.

00:17:35.150 --> 00:17:39.630
When you say to me, "You're working
on a new book," I say, "Yes,"

00:17:39.630 --> 00:17:42.590
but I really say, "I'm
working in a book."

00:17:42.590 --> 00:17:44.800
You have to get in that
other time and you have

00:17:44.800 --> 00:17:46.840
to understand those human beings.

00:17:46.840 --> 00:17:50.040
History is not about statistics

00:17:50.040 --> 00:17:53.270
and memorizing dates,
and boring quotations.

00:17:53.270 --> 00:17:55.300
History is about people.

00:17:55.300 --> 00:18:00.390
It's about human beings when in the
course of human events and we have

00:18:00.390 --> 00:18:03.500
to be able to put ourselves in
the shoes of those other people

00:18:03.500 --> 00:18:07.590
and know what the life that they
lived was like, what the hardships,

00:18:07.590 --> 00:18:12.200
adversities that they faced that
we don't even have to think about

00:18:12.200 --> 00:18:16.990
and what spoiled brats we are that
we have so much that we owe all

00:18:16.990 --> 00:18:20.660
to them, and yet we don't
bother to know who they were.

00:18:20.660 --> 00:18:23.510
It's not right.

00:18:23.510 --> 00:18:29.040
[ Applause ]

00:18:29.040 --> 00:18:32.470
So I do the research as I go
along and as you do the research

00:18:32.470 --> 00:18:35.420
and as you learn more, then
you have different questions.

00:18:35.420 --> 00:18:39.360
You have to ask questions
all the time.

00:18:39.360 --> 00:18:40.810
Why did this happen?

00:18:40.810 --> 00:18:42.110
Where was he?

00:18:42.110 --> 00:18:43.410
Who was he?

00:18:43.410 --> 00:18:46.870
What was he or she worried about?

00:18:46.870 --> 00:18:56.330
And you have to keep learning more
from the original sources, letters,

00:18:56.330 --> 00:19:01.070
diaries, unpublished memoires
and the like, and, of course,

00:19:01.070 --> 00:19:04.850
that's where the gold, all,
so much of it is right here

00:19:04.850 --> 00:19:06.940
in the Library of Congress.

00:19:06.940 --> 00:19:10.770
When I was working on the Wright
Brothers Book, all those letters

00:19:10.770 --> 00:19:14.190 position:56%
that they wrote to each other, and
to their father, and to their mother

00:19:14.190 --> 00:19:18.400
and sister, Katharine, are all
here in the Library of Congress

00:19:18.400 --> 00:19:23.090
and you read those letters,
these two young fellows who grew

00:19:23.090 --> 00:19:27.940
up in a house that had no
running water, no indoor plumbing,

00:19:27.940 --> 00:19:35.930
no central heat, no telephone
and you could put ten of them

00:19:35.930 --> 00:19:41.320
in this room, tiny little
house but it was full of books,

00:19:41.320 --> 00:19:43.590
and their father insisted
that they all read

00:19:43.590 --> 00:19:47.310
and that they read
above their level.

00:19:47.310 --> 00:19:52.340 position:56%
And those letters that they wrote
expressed what he drummed into them,

00:19:52.340 --> 00:19:57.940
learn how to use the English
language on paper and on your feet.

00:19:57.940 --> 00:20:01.390
Their vocabulary, their
handling of --

00:20:01.390 --> 00:20:05.400
is breathtaking and they never
even finished high school,

00:20:05.400 --> 00:20:09.100
and when I see the
writing that is produced

00:20:09.100 --> 00:20:10.700
by college students today --

00:20:10.700 --> 00:20:15.480
when I learn that nearly
all the law schools

00:20:15.480 --> 00:20:20.240
in our country are now requiring
incoming freshman, who, of course,

00:20:20.240 --> 00:20:24.520
are all college graduates, to
take a basic a writing course

00:20:24.520 --> 00:20:29.380
because they can't write a
respectable, presentable letter

00:20:29.380 --> 00:20:35.080
or report, or proposal
of some kind in the work

00:20:35.080 --> 00:20:37.510
that they are going
to have to be doing.

00:20:37.510 --> 00:20:43.280
We have to knuckle down and get
back to learning how to write,

00:20:43.280 --> 00:20:46.900
learning how to read
with concentration

00:20:46.900 --> 00:20:50.790
and understanding and
teaching history.

00:20:50.790 --> 00:20:55.200
We're raising a generation --
we're raising several generations

00:20:55.200 --> 00:21:00.060
of young Americans -- and I know
this because I lecture or teach

00:21:00.060 --> 00:21:03.850
at colleges and universities
constantly all over the country.

00:21:03.850 --> 00:21:07.100
We're raising young people
who are, by and large,

00:21:07.100 --> 00:21:14.150 position:56%
historically illiterate and it's not
their fault and I think that some

00:21:14.150 --> 00:21:16.600
of the brightest people I've
ever met are some of the students

00:21:16.600 --> 00:21:22.180
that I'm involved with in
colleges and university.

00:21:22.180 --> 00:21:26.300
And we have to stimulate curiosity,
ask questions, ask questions.

00:21:26.300 --> 00:21:29.270
don't think you always
have to have the answers.

00:21:29.270 --> 00:21:30.700
I don't have all the answers.

00:21:30.700 --> 00:21:34.520 position:56%
I hope I never reach the point where
I think I have all the answers,

00:21:34.520 --> 00:21:37.540
and curiosity, and I
forgotten who said this,

00:21:37.540 --> 00:21:40.350
and I wish I could remember.

00:21:40.350 --> 00:21:42.560
One of the great writers said,

00:21:42.560 --> 00:21:46.510
"Curiosity is what separates
us from the cabbages."

00:21:46.510 --> 00:21:50.310
[ Laughter ]

00:21:50.310 --> 00:21:52.130
&gt;&gt; David Rubenstein: So when
you are writing, do you type it?

00:21:52.130 --> 00:21:54.220
Do you use a typewriter,
a word processor?

00:21:54.220 --> 00:21:55.520
Do you use long hand?

00:21:55.520 --> 00:21:56.820
&gt;&gt; David McCollough: Are you ready?

00:21:56.820 --> 00:22:00.000
&gt;&gt; David Rubenstein:
What is the answer?

00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:04.650
&gt;&gt; David McCollough: I am proud to
say I work on a manual typewriter.

00:22:05.920 --> 00:22:07.260
&gt;&gt; David Rubenstein: Okay.

00:22:07.260 --> 00:22:09.440
When it breaks, where
do you get the parts?

00:22:09.440 --> 00:22:11.040
&gt;&gt; David McCollough:
It's never broken.

00:22:11.040 --> 00:22:12.340
&gt;&gt; David Rubenstein: Really.

00:22:12.340 --> 00:22:14.480
&gt;&gt; David McCollough: I bought
it second hand in order

00:22:14.480 --> 00:22:17.320
to write my first book,
"The Johnstown Flood."

00:22:17.320 --> 00:22:22.520
I'd always work at Time and
Life with the issued typewriter

00:22:22.520 --> 00:22:26.900
on the job, which was
manual Royal typewriter.

00:22:26.900 --> 00:22:30.030
We were living in White
Plains, New York.

00:22:30.030 --> 00:22:32.560
I went to a typewriter shop

00:22:32.560 --> 00:22:38.470 position:56%
and bought a second hand Royal
typewriter that was in 25 years old.

00:22:38.470 --> 00:22:42.470
I paid 75 dollars for it.

00:22:42.470 --> 00:22:45.520
I've written everything I've
ever written, every speech,

00:22:45.520 --> 00:22:51.630
every article, every book on
that typewriter for over 50 years

00:22:51.630 --> 00:22:56.430
and there is nothing wrong with
it and there never has been.

00:22:56.430 --> 00:22:57.730
&gt;&gt; David Rubenstein: Wow.

00:22:57.730 --> 00:22:59.780
&gt;&gt; David McCollough: Talk about --

00:22:59.780 --> 00:23:03.870
by no means was the notion
of planned obsolescence enter

00:23:03.870 --> 00:23:07.310
in to the minds of the
manufacturers of that machine.

00:23:07.310 --> 00:23:09.020
It's fantastic.

00:23:09.020 --> 00:23:11.210
Now, why this typewriter?

00:23:11.210 --> 00:23:15.140
Why not word processor?

00:23:15.140 --> 00:23:17.520
It goes too fast.

00:23:17.520 --> 00:23:22.960
I don't think all that fast and
if you hit the wrong button,

00:23:22.960 --> 00:23:26.190
you can eliminate months of work.

00:23:27.510 --> 00:23:31.050
[ Laughter ]

00:23:31.050 --> 00:23:33.190
I have a friend, Bill
Fowler, a very good historian,

00:23:33.190 --> 00:23:34.950
a very good book writer,
lost 5000 words

00:23:34.950 --> 00:23:38.080
because he hit the wrong button.

00:23:38.080 --> 00:23:41.950
Also I love to take the
paper out of the typewriter

00:23:41.950 --> 00:23:46.820
and after I finish the chapter,
put it up on the clipboard.

00:23:46.820 --> 00:23:50.150
If it's a good weather, find
a nice comfortable place

00:23:50.150 --> 00:23:55.750 position:56%
to take an outdoor chair and sit
under a tree and let the editor, me,

00:23:55.750 --> 00:23:59.420
show that mug who wrote that
stuff how it should really be done

00:23:59.420 --> 00:24:02.580
and you're editing
on the manuscript.

00:24:02.580 --> 00:24:05.200
With a machine, all
that it's eliminated.

00:24:05.200 --> 00:24:10.290
You never see that again, but with
this, you can see the process.

00:24:10.290 --> 00:24:16.130
Now the only other avid,
devoted typewriter man

00:24:16.130 --> 00:24:18.320
that I know is Tom Hanks.

00:24:18.320 --> 00:24:21.840 position:56%
And Tom Hanks writes all of this
letters, everything, on a typewriter

00:24:21.840 --> 00:24:24.040
and he has, what must be,

00:24:24.040 --> 00:24:26.960
the world's greatest typewriter
collection, more than, I'm sure,

00:24:26.960 --> 00:24:32.320
there are at the Smithsonian, and
he understands perfectly why I work

00:24:32.320 --> 00:24:38.090
on a typewriter, and I urge
others to do it and I urge others

00:24:38.090 --> 00:24:42.840
to remember how much work
goes into writing a book.

00:24:42.840 --> 00:24:45.510
&gt;&gt; David Rubenstein: I think Robert
Caro still uses his typewriter

00:24:45.510 --> 00:24:46.810
as well.

00:24:46.810 --> 00:24:48.110
&gt;&gt; David McCollough: Yes, he does.

00:24:48.110 --> 00:24:49.410
&gt;&gt; David Rubenstein: How many words
do you do a day before you say,

00:24:49.410 --> 00:24:51.760
"Okay, that's it."

00:24:51.760 --> 00:24:56.530
&gt;&gt; David McCollough: Well, in the
old days, when I was full of beams,

00:24:56.530 --> 00:25:01.490
I would do four pages a day
when I was growing underway.

00:25:01.490 --> 00:25:03.260
Now, I try to do two pages a day.

00:25:03.260 --> 00:25:08.530
Two pages a day is ten
pages a week or more

00:25:08.530 --> 00:25:12.260
because I often work seven days a
week and by the end of the month,

00:25:12.260 --> 00:25:15.940
you've got a chapter, or the
beginnings of the chapter.

00:25:15.940 --> 00:25:17.240
&gt;&gt; David Rubenstein: Right.

00:25:17.240 --> 00:25:20.090 position:56%
&gt;&gt; David McCollough: I'm often asked
how much of my time I spent writing

00:25:20.090 --> 00:25:23.170
and how much of my time
I spend doing research,

00:25:23.170 --> 00:25:25.280
perfectly good question.

00:25:25.280 --> 00:25:29.640
Nobody ever asked me how much
of your time you spend thinking.

00:25:29.640 --> 00:25:31.210
&gt;&gt; David Rubenstein: How much of
your time do you spend thinking?

00:25:31.210 --> 00:25:32.740
&gt;&gt; David McCollough: Yeah.

00:25:32.740 --> 00:25:34.040
&gt;&gt; David Rubenstein:
What's the answer?

00:25:34.040 --> 00:25:35.340
&gt;&gt; David McCollough: There you
are, David, you're the first man.

00:25:35.340 --> 00:25:38.900
&gt;&gt; David Rubenstein: All
right, so what's the answer:

00:25:38.900 --> 00:25:40.200
&gt;&gt; David McCollough: A lot.

00:25:40.200 --> 00:25:42.030
If you were looking in
the window where I work,

00:25:42.030 --> 00:25:48.090
you might think the guy's
asleep but I'm thinking deeply.

00:25:48.090 --> 00:25:52.790
&gt;&gt; David Rubenstein: Well, in
my roles at the Smithsonian,

00:25:52.790 --> 00:25:56.370
whenever you do retire, can
you give us that typewriter?

00:25:56.370 --> 00:25:57.670
&gt;&gt; David McCollough:
Well, I'm not sure.

00:25:57.670 --> 00:25:58.970
I have to talk to the boss.

00:25:58.970 --> 00:26:00.270
&gt;&gt; David Rubenstein: Okay.

00:26:00.270 --> 00:26:02.560
Let's talk about this book.

00:26:02.560 --> 00:26:04.640
You've written ten books before.

00:26:04.640 --> 00:26:05.940
This is your eleventh book.

00:26:05.940 --> 00:26:07.240
&gt;&gt; David McCollough: Yes.

00:26:07.240 --> 00:26:08.540
&gt;&gt; David Rubenstein: We're
going to talk shortly

00:26:08.540 --> 00:26:09.840
about your twelfth book
called, "The Pioneers,"

00:26:09.840 --> 00:26:11.140
which is going to be out in 2019.

00:26:11.140 --> 00:26:12.440
&gt;&gt; David McCollough: Yes.

00:26:12.440 --> 00:26:15.010
&gt;&gt; David Rubenstein: This book
is a compilation of your speeches

00:26:15.010 --> 00:26:19.060
and honorary degree
of commencement talks.

00:26:19.060 --> 00:26:21.010
You've got 55 honorary degrees.

00:26:21.010 --> 00:26:22.850
That must near a world record.

00:26:22.850 --> 00:26:26.100 position:56%
When you give a commencement
speech, what do you have left to say

00:26:26.100 --> 00:26:27.400
that you haven't said before.

00:26:27.400 --> 00:26:29.120
Do you get tired of saying
the same things to students?

00:26:29.120 --> 00:26:30.990
Are they really listening to
these commencement speeches?

00:26:30.990 --> 00:26:33.710
&gt;&gt; David McCollough: No, because
the setting of every talk,

00:26:33.710 --> 00:26:36.480
like everyone you meet,
is different.

00:26:36.480 --> 00:26:39.990 position:56%
So you want to know something about
the university where you're speaking

00:26:39.990 --> 00:26:42.880
or the college where you're
speaking, or if you're invited

00:26:42.880 --> 00:26:47.470
to speak let's say at some event
at the White House or capitol,

00:26:47.470 --> 00:26:48.770
you have to do the homework.

00:26:48.770 --> 00:26:50.070
&gt;&gt; David Rubenstein:
So you do the research.

00:26:50.070 --> 00:26:55.980
&gt;&gt; David McCollough: I do a lot of
research and I'm very conscientious

00:26:55.980 --> 00:26:59.300
that what I'm saying is
going to go on the record

00:26:59.300 --> 00:27:01.460
at the university or
at the -- [inaudible]

00:27:01.460 --> 00:27:02.910
&gt;&gt; David Rubenstein: All
right, so let's talk about some

00:27:02.910 --> 00:27:06.140
of these speeches and this
is a highly readable book.

00:27:06.140 --> 00:27:08.660
I highly recommend it
and let's talk about one

00:27:08.660 --> 00:27:10.490
of the first speeches in here.

00:27:10.490 --> 00:27:13.750
You were asked to give a speech
to the joint session of Congress.

00:27:13.750 --> 00:27:17.440 position:56%
Very few citizens, private
citizens, are ever asked to do that.

00:27:17.440 --> 00:27:20.130
How did that come about and
what did you want to talk

00:27:20.130 --> 00:27:22.700
about to the members of Congress?

00:27:22.700 --> 00:27:26.090
&gt;&gt; David McCollough: There
was a gathering of historians

00:27:26.090 --> 00:27:32.750
and biographers that spoke at a
conference here at the Library

00:27:32.750 --> 00:27:39.400
of Congress on the Congress
and after that was over,

00:27:39.400 --> 00:27:44.330
when it came time -- it
was the bicentennial, 1989,

00:27:44.330 --> 00:27:50.010 position:56%
I was asked to come and give a
shorter version of the speech I gave

00:27:50.010 --> 00:27:52.470
at that gathering at
the Library of Congress.

00:27:52.470 --> 00:27:53.870
&gt;&gt; David Rubenstein: Shorter
version because members

00:27:53.870 --> 00:27:56.730
of Congress don't like
long speeches or?

00:27:58.400 --> 00:28:00.540
&gt;&gt; David McCollough: I would
imagine they were afraid

00:28:00.540 --> 00:28:05.390
that I would run away with my
excitement and go on forever.

00:28:05.390 --> 00:28:06.690
&gt;&gt; David Rubenstein: All right.

00:28:06.690 --> 00:28:09.560 position:56%
&gt;&gt; David McCollough: But it was a
very, very high compliment and honor

00:28:09.560 --> 00:28:13.790
and I worked extremely
hard on preparing this.

00:28:13.790 --> 00:28:15.090
&gt;&gt; David Rubenstein: One
of the people you talk

00:28:15.090 --> 00:28:17.330 position:56%
about there was John Quincy Adams --

00:28:17.330 --> 00:28:18.630
&gt;&gt; David McCollough: Yes.

00:28:18.630 --> 00:28:19.930 position:56%
&gt;&gt; David Rubenstein: -- who had been
a member of Congress for 20 years

00:28:19.930 --> 00:28:21.530
after he left the presidency.

00:28:21.530 --> 00:28:23.630
Why did you talk about him
and what do you think is

00:28:23.630 --> 00:28:25.900
so appealing about
John Quincy Adams?

00:28:25.900 --> 00:28:32.760
&gt;&gt; David McCollough: John Quincy
Adams had been a diplomat,

00:28:32.760 --> 00:28:37.740
served in several diplomatic post,
very important diplomatic post.

00:28:37.740 --> 00:28:42.530
He'd been a senator and he'd been
president of the United States

00:28:42.530 --> 00:28:46.610
and after he left the
presidency, he was asked if he,

00:28:46.610 --> 00:28:48.370
by any chance, run for Congress.

00:28:48.370 --> 00:28:53.480
He said, "Certainly," so he
went back and served in Congress

00:28:53.480 --> 00:28:58.330
until his death and he died
on the floor of the Congress.

00:28:58.330 --> 00:29:02.090
He died in the, what
is now, Statuary Hall,

00:29:02.090 --> 00:29:04.420
in the little room off to the side.

00:29:04.420 --> 00:29:07.930
He died in "heinous,"
as they said then.

00:29:07.930 --> 00:29:09.580
He didn't have to do that.

00:29:09.580 --> 00:29:13.660
He didn't have to be a
congressman as he was,

00:29:13.660 --> 00:29:17.100
but he had a mission
not only to represent

00:29:17.100 --> 00:29:20.960
as best he could his
constituency in Massachusetts

00:29:20.960 --> 00:29:26.460
but to represent the country and
more than that the constituency,

00:29:26.460 --> 00:29:30.590 position:56%
and he was ardently against slavery.

00:29:30.590 --> 00:29:34.240
So he was battling slavery
on the floor of the Congress

00:29:34.240 --> 00:29:40.450
until the day he fell dead or fell
down and died a few days later.

00:29:40.450 --> 00:29:46.450
And talk about devotion, talk
about integrity, talk about truth

00:29:46.450 --> 00:29:55.510
and honesty and loyalty,
his father, John Adams,

00:29:55.510 --> 00:30:00.380
was the only founding father
present, only one in the presence

00:30:00.380 --> 00:30:07.260 position:56%
who was a founding father, who never
owned a slave out of principle,

00:30:07.260 --> 00:30:11.900
and his wife, Abigail, was even
more adamant on the subject.

00:30:11.900 --> 00:30:16.490
The next president who never owned
a slave was John Quincy Adams,

00:30:16.490 --> 00:30:20.020
so it ran in the family, as did
dedication to public service.

00:30:20.020 --> 00:30:22.400
It ran in the family.

00:30:22.400 --> 00:30:25.060
He was also brilliant.

00:30:25.060 --> 00:30:26.360
He was interested in everything.

00:30:26.360 --> 00:30:29.290
He spoke many languages.

00:30:29.290 --> 00:30:32.820
He was, in many ways, I think
he may have had the highest IQ,

00:30:32.820 --> 00:30:37.090
the most fertile, versatile mind
of anybody who has been president,

00:30:37.090 --> 00:30:41.350
even including the
greatest among the founders,

00:30:41.350 --> 00:30:45.460
but as chance would have it, he
was only a one-term president

00:30:45.460 --> 00:30:49.930
and one-term presidents don't
get the attention that others do.

00:30:49.930 --> 00:30:52.190
It's the same now as it was then.

00:30:52.190 --> 00:30:53.490
&gt;&gt; David Rubenstein: Let me ask you

00:30:53.490 --> 00:30:55.410
about another president
you've talked about.

00:30:55.410 --> 00:30:57.800
You spoke on the 4th of
July at an Immigration

00:30:57.800 --> 00:31:00.160
and Naturalization
ceremony at Monticello,

00:31:00.160 --> 00:31:02.050
which is held every 4th of July.

00:31:02.050 --> 00:31:04.810
Monticello is Thomas
Jefferson's home.

00:31:04.810 --> 00:31:09.690
Thomas Jefferson gave us the creed
that all men are created equal

00:31:09.690 --> 00:31:12.470
that he wrote in the Preamble to
the Declaration of Independence

00:31:12.470 --> 00:31:16.220
but how do you swear that with
the fact that he was a slave owner

00:31:16.220 --> 00:31:19.340
and how do you address that issue
and how do you think he addressed

00:31:19.340 --> 00:31:20.870
that issue of the fact
that he was a slave owner

00:31:20.870 --> 00:31:23.280
but he thought all men
should be created equal?

00:31:23.280 --> 00:31:24.580
&gt;&gt; David McCollough: I don't.

00:31:24.580 --> 00:31:28.690
I can't. I don't understand it,
nor do I understand the fact

00:31:28.690 --> 00:31:32.630
that he destroyed every letter
he ever wrote to his wife

00:31:32.630 --> 00:31:35.380
and every letter she
ever wrote to him.

00:31:35.380 --> 00:31:37.540
So we know nothing about her.

00:31:37.540 --> 00:31:42.120
We don't even know what she looked
like and I can't understand.

00:31:42.120 --> 00:31:46.880
I can't understand that he kept
very close track of every cent,

00:31:46.880 --> 00:31:50.230
every dime he ever
spent on anything.

00:31:50.230 --> 00:31:56.260
He has incredible financial
records but he never added it up.

00:31:56.260 --> 00:32:01.090
&gt;&gt; David Rubenstein: Well, that
was why he probably was bankrupt

00:32:01.090 --> 00:32:02.390
at the end.

00:32:02.390 --> 00:32:03.800
&gt;&gt; David McCollough: He
was never out of debt

00:32:03.800 --> 00:32:05.470
from the time he was a young man.

00:32:05.470 --> 00:32:07.030
He just kept spending.

00:32:07.030 --> 00:32:08.340
I don't understand it.

00:32:08.340 --> 00:32:11.990
But I also don't understand
where that genius came from.

00:32:11.990 --> 00:32:16.730
The man was a genius and if he'd
been nothing but an architect,

00:32:16.730 --> 00:32:18.480
now that alone would qualify him

00:32:18.480 --> 00:32:21.670
to be somebody we all
should know about.

00:32:21.670 --> 00:32:28.430
And he served a brilliant service
to all of us with this idea

00:32:28.430 --> 00:32:30.600
that all men are created equal,

00:32:30.600 --> 00:32:35.750
but he also said something I think
has not been sufficiently played

00:32:35.750 --> 00:32:37.050
out and given.

00:32:37.050 --> 00:32:40.690
He hasn't been given
sufficient credit for

00:32:40.690 --> 00:32:45.890
and that is his absolute
belief in education.

00:32:45.890 --> 00:32:49.800
He said, "Any nation that
expects to be ignorant and free,

00:32:49.800 --> 00:32:53.330
expects what never
was and never can be."

00:32:53.330 --> 00:32:54.870
We have to be educated.

00:32:54.870 --> 00:32:56.540
We have to be literate.

00:32:56.540 --> 00:33:01.120
We have to understand that there
are no easy answers to big problems

00:33:01.120 --> 00:33:08.030
and so forth and nobody has
glib solutions to big problems.

00:33:08.030 --> 00:33:09.330
They have to be worked out.

00:33:09.330 --> 00:33:13.690
I wish I'd have the
chance to know him.

00:33:13.690 --> 00:33:15.510
&gt;&gt; David Rubenstein:
Let's speak about that.

00:33:15.510 --> 00:33:19.840
If all the people you've written
about, John Adams, Harry Truman,

00:33:19.840 --> 00:33:23.280
John Quincy Adams, Thomas
Jefferson, if you could have dinner

00:33:23.280 --> 00:33:26.000
with any one president
who's not alive,

00:33:26.000 --> 00:33:28.300
who would you like
to have dinner with?

00:33:32.110 --> 00:33:33.410
&gt;&gt; David McCollough: John Adams.

00:33:33.410 --> 00:33:34.710
&gt;&gt; David Rubenstein: John Adams?

00:33:34.710 --> 00:33:36.010
&gt;&gt; David McCollough:
Because there are

00:33:36.010 --> 00:33:37.760 position:56%
so many questions I want to ask him.

00:33:37.760 --> 00:33:39.060
&gt;&gt; David Rubenstein: All right,

00:33:39.060 --> 00:33:40.360
let's talk about John
Adams for a moment.

00:33:40.360 --> 00:33:43.680
You gave a speech at the
University of Massachusetts.

00:33:43.680 --> 00:33:45.500
You talked about John Adams.

00:33:45.500 --> 00:33:49.830
Of the founding fathers, he
gets a little less attention

00:33:49.830 --> 00:33:52.810
than George Washington, Thomas
Jefferson, James Madison.

00:33:52.810 --> 00:33:55.800
Why do you think so few people
paid that much attention

00:33:55.800 --> 00:33:58.940 position:56%
until your book came out and why do
you think there is still no monument

00:33:58.940 --> 00:34:01.140
in John Adams in Washington D.C.?

00:34:01.140 --> 00:34:02.750
&gt;&gt; David McCollough: Yes, there is.

00:34:02.750 --> 00:34:04.050
&gt;&gt; David Rubenstein: Where?

00:34:04.050 --> 00:34:06.610
&gt;&gt; David McCollough: He's on the
mantle piece in the White House.

00:34:06.610 --> 00:34:07.910
&gt;&gt; David Rubenstein: Oh.

00:34:07.910 --> 00:34:09.210
&gt;&gt; David McCollough:
You know about that?

00:34:09.210 --> 00:34:10.920
&gt;&gt; David Rubenstein: I don't.

00:34:10.920 --> 00:34:13.060
&gt;&gt; David McCollough: John Adams
was the first [inaudible] president

00:34:13.060 --> 00:34:18.360
to reside in the White House and
his first night, he was alone,

00:34:18.360 --> 00:34:25.010 position:56%
Abigail had not arrived yet and the
next morning, after his first night,

00:34:25.010 --> 00:34:31.520 position:56%
he wrote her a letter in which he
said -- what he wrote in the letter,

00:34:31.520 --> 00:34:35.140
Franklin Roosevelt had carved
into the wooden part of the mantle

00:34:35.140 --> 00:34:40.390
in the east room, the
same dining room.

00:34:40.390 --> 00:34:43.460
When Truman was in charge
of redoing the White House,

00:34:43.460 --> 00:34:47.120
he made sure that that
quotation stayed there.

00:34:47.120 --> 00:34:51.700
When Kennedy became president,
he had it carved into the marble

00:34:51.700 --> 00:34:58.520 position:56%
of the mantle piece so that it would
stay forever and what Adams had said

00:34:58.520 --> 00:35:03.800
in the letter to Abigail was
this, "May none but honest

00:35:03.800 --> 00:35:06.850
and wise men ever rule
under this roof."

00:35:06.850 --> 00:35:09.150
&gt;&gt; David Rubenstein: Oh!

00:35:19.170 --> 00:35:23.480
&gt;&gt; David McCollough: I think it's
very important to understand,

00:35:23.480 --> 00:35:29.850
to think about, he put honesty
first ahead of wisdom, honesty.

00:35:29.850 --> 00:35:34.710
&gt;&gt; David Rubenstein: So in your
Pulitzer Prize-winning book

00:35:34.710 --> 00:35:38.990
on John Adams, which was also made
into an HBO series and won a lot

00:35:38.990 --> 00:35:42.720
of awards as well, you went
through about 1000 letter

00:35:42.720 --> 00:35:45.270
between John Adams
and Abigail Adams.

00:35:45.270 --> 00:35:49.060
Have you ever experienced like that
between a husband and wife before

00:35:49.060 --> 00:35:53.880
and what was it that struck you
so unusual about those letters?

00:35:53.880 --> 00:35:55.860
&gt;&gt; David McCollough: The quality
of the use of the English language,

00:35:55.860 --> 00:35:58.400
the quality of the use of the mind,

00:35:58.400 --> 00:36:02.200
how well read they both
were, superbly read.

00:36:02.200 --> 00:36:05.650
John Adams advised his
young son, at the time --

00:36:05.650 --> 00:36:10.890
he was about 10 years old when they
went off with his father to Europe

00:36:10.890 --> 00:36:18.120
to serve as a diplomatic -- he
said, "You'll never be alone

00:36:18.120 --> 00:36:23.390
if you have a poet in your pocket,"
in other words, carry a book

00:36:23.390 --> 00:36:29.550
and that was part of the
relationship attitude toward life.

00:36:29.550 --> 00:36:33.870
They were incredible readers
and Abigail was right there

00:36:33.870 --> 00:36:36.990
and her letters are phenomenal.

00:36:36.990 --> 00:36:39.500
&gt;&gt; David Rubenstein: She
was not college educated.

00:36:39.500 --> 00:36:40.800
&gt;&gt; David McCollough: No,
she never to college.

00:36:40.800 --> 00:36:42.100
She never went to school.

00:36:42.100 --> 00:36:47.620
She was tutored at home as it
were but she never stopped reading

00:36:47.620 --> 00:36:51.070
and she was brilliant and she was
brave, and patriotic and she put

00:36:51.070 --> 00:36:55.220
up with incredible
difficulties, running the family,

00:36:55.220 --> 00:36:58.360
running the household, trying
to stay afloat financially

00:36:58.360 --> 00:37:01.380
when he was off serving overseas.

00:37:01.380 --> 00:37:06.120
And those children were
raised by her in a way

00:37:06.120 --> 00:37:09.550
that they would never forget.

00:37:09.550 --> 00:37:15.790
At that dinner party you
were asking who would I have,

00:37:15.790 --> 00:37:19.300
I would definitely want
Abigail Adams there

00:37:19.300 --> 00:37:24.070
and I would definitely
want Katharine Wright,

00:37:24.070 --> 00:37:26.540
the sister of the Wright Brothers.

00:37:26.540 --> 00:37:30.960
You can't understand what
they did and how they did it

00:37:30.960 --> 00:37:35.620
if you don't understand the
part played by Katharine Wright.

00:37:35.620 --> 00:37:37.810
Oh was she something.

00:37:37.810 --> 00:37:44.710
She kept at them and made them
tell the line and behave themselves

00:37:44.710 --> 00:37:48.190
in a way that we all need.

00:37:48.190 --> 00:37:49.990
&gt;&gt; David Rubenstein: You
gave a speech at Dartmouth

00:37:49.990 --> 00:37:51.800
and there are two people
featured in that speech

00:37:51.800 --> 00:37:53.100
about whom you've written.

00:37:53.100 --> 00:37:54.400
One was Teddy Roosevelt.

00:37:54.400 --> 00:37:56.600
You wrote a book not
about his presidency

00:37:56.600 --> 00:38:00.030
but about the time he left New
York in the east and went west.

00:38:00.030 --> 00:38:03.220
Why did you find that such
an appealing part of his life

00:38:03.220 --> 00:38:07.410 position:56%
and what was the most important
lesson you took away from that book?

00:38:07.410 --> 00:38:08.860
&gt;&gt; David McCollough:
Theodore Roosevelt is

00:38:08.860 --> 00:38:13.360
like a caterpillar
turning into a butterfly.

00:38:13.360 --> 00:38:17.690
He was a child who was
not expected to live.

00:38:17.690 --> 00:38:24.270
He suffered terribly
of seizures of asthma,

00:38:24.270 --> 00:38:27.310
which were really life threatening.

00:38:27.310 --> 00:38:34.270 position:56%
He was afraid of everything, fearful
of everything and he outgrew it,

00:38:34.270 --> 00:38:42.150
and he outgrew it by
facing adversity.

00:38:42.150 --> 00:38:50.630
He took hold of himself and he
worked hard at it all the way

00:38:50.630 --> 00:38:54.760
through college but then onto life.

00:38:54.760 --> 00:38:59.040
His father's death was a
devastating experience for him.

00:38:59.040 --> 00:39:08.090 position:56%
Then his wife and mother died on the
same day and he was a shattered man

00:39:08.090 --> 00:39:11.840
and that's when he went west.

00:39:11.840 --> 00:39:17.290
And this whole idea of
going west is so American.

00:39:17.290 --> 00:39:18.590
It's a way of healing.

00:39:18.590 --> 00:39:19.890
It's a way of escaping.

00:39:19.890 --> 00:39:24.300
It's been traditionally and
many historians have written

00:39:24.300 --> 00:39:30.370
and quite profoundly about this
and he is the essence of that,

00:39:30.370 --> 00:39:34.010
but he never forgot who he was
and where he was going back to

00:39:34.010 --> 00:39:37.500
and when he comes back, he then
remarries and gets involved

00:39:37.500 --> 00:39:40.120
in politics in a big serious way.

00:39:40.120 --> 00:39:41.910
&gt;&gt; David Rubenstein: Now, you've
also spoken to Dartmouth --

00:39:41.910 --> 00:39:44.460
&gt;&gt; David McCollough:
He was brilliant --

00:39:44.460 --> 00:39:47.390
wonderful writer, and
he was a historian.

00:39:47.390 --> 00:39:50.790
None of our great presidents
has ever been one

00:39:50.790 --> 00:39:53.460
who had no interest
in history, true.

00:39:53.460 --> 00:39:57.110
So he wrote about 40 books.

00:39:57.110 --> 00:40:01.920
Theodore Roosevelt wrote many
books including a very good book,

00:40:01.920 --> 00:40:06.820
I still consider a good book on the
naval war of 1812, which he started

00:40:06.820 --> 00:40:09.330
when he was still in college.

00:40:09.330 --> 00:40:12.960
Woodrow Wilson, of course,
was a professor of History.

00:40:12.960 --> 00:40:16.750
Dwight Eisenhower's "Crusade in
Europe" is one of the best books

00:40:16.750 --> 00:40:20.890 position:56%
about World War II ever written and
he wrote every word of that himself.

00:40:20.890 --> 00:40:24.160
No ghostwriter did
anything to help him.

00:40:24.160 --> 00:40:28.720
And, of course, Kennedy wrote
several works of his, "Profiles

00:40:28.720 --> 00:40:32.630
and Courage," and kept referring
to history, citing history,

00:40:32.630 --> 00:40:35.860
bringing history into the
dialogue of the presidency

00:40:35.860 --> 00:40:39.590
of the executive office
again, and again, and again.

00:40:39.590 --> 00:40:40.980
&gt;&gt; David Rubenstein: Now, you
also in the "Darkness [inaudible]

00:40:40.980 --> 00:40:42.480
" talked about Harry Truman --

00:40:42.480 --> 00:40:43.780
&gt;&gt; David McCollough: Yes.

00:40:43.780 --> 00:40:45.080
&gt;&gt; David Rubenstein: -- about whom
you wrote another Pulitzer Prize

00:40:45.080 --> 00:40:46.380
winning book.

00:40:46.380 --> 00:40:48.890
Why was Harry Truman so unpopular
when he left the presidency,

00:40:48.890 --> 00:40:52.340
15% popularity rating, but now
he's everything favorite president.

00:40:52.340 --> 00:40:55.220
What changed in the years since
he left the presidency other

00:40:55.220 --> 00:40:57.520
than your book?

00:40:58.600 --> 00:41:04.200 position:56%
&gt;&gt; David McCollough: Well, it began
before I wrote the book, believe me.

00:41:04.200 --> 00:41:08.540
I grew up in a very old-fashioned
Republic family and the night

00:41:08.540 --> 00:41:13.230
of the 1948, I was a high school
student, and I was very interested

00:41:13.230 --> 00:41:16.990
in politics and I tried to
stay awake to hear who won but,

00:41:16.990 --> 00:41:21.540
as some of you may remember, the
final tally didn't come in until

00:41:21.540 --> 00:41:24.440
about two in the morning, and I
just couldn't stay up that late.

00:41:24.440 --> 00:41:26.000
I fell asleep.

00:41:26.000 --> 00:41:28.380
The father was in shaving
the next morning.

00:41:28.380 --> 00:41:31.860
I went in and I said,
"Dad, dad, who won?"

00:41:31.860 --> 00:41:37.200
He said, "Truman," like
the end of the world.

00:41:37.200 --> 00:41:40.370
Well, twenty or thirty
years later, I was back home

00:41:40.370 --> 00:41:44.640
and we were having a chat
after dinner and he started

00:41:44.640 --> 00:41:47.330
in on how the world was going to
hell and the country was going

00:41:47.330 --> 00:41:50.860
to hell, and he paused, he said,

00:41:50.860 --> 00:41:54.420
"Too bad old Harry isn't
still in the White House."

00:41:56.790 --> 00:42:01.840
But Harry Truman is a
great American story.

00:42:01.840 --> 00:42:05.080
This wonderful gathering here
is about the American story.

00:42:05.080 --> 00:42:08.810
If there was ever a story
that is so American,

00:42:08.810 --> 00:42:10.870
I don't know of another one.

00:42:10.870 --> 00:42:16.950
He is Harry True man from a
place called, "independence,"

00:42:16.950 --> 00:42:19.880
and he never went to college.

00:42:19.880 --> 00:42:22.620
He had to go on in as his own.

00:42:22.620 --> 00:42:30.880
He had all kinds of bad luck
and defeat but he never gave up.

00:42:30.880 --> 00:42:33.530
My favorite people are the
people that don't give up.

00:42:33.530 --> 00:42:37.180
George Washington in 1776
had every reason in the world

00:42:37.180 --> 00:42:38.480
to say, "Well, that's enough.

00:42:38.480 --> 00:42:42.330
We can't win this war, the hell
with it," but he would not give up

00:42:42.330 --> 00:42:45.030
and he knew how to convince
others; we're not going to give up.

00:42:45.030 --> 00:42:48.380
The Wright Brothers never gave up.

00:42:48.380 --> 00:42:50.460
Washington Roebling in the
building of the Brooklyn Bridge,

00:42:50.460 --> 00:42:52.900
they had many reasons to
say, "The hell with this.

00:42:52.900 --> 00:42:56.620
This is more than can be achieved,"
but they wouldn't give up.

00:42:56.620 --> 00:42:58.040
&gt;&gt; David Rubenstein: Talking
about never giving up,

00:42:58.040 --> 00:43:01.460
you gave a speech at
Ohio University --

00:43:01.460 --> 00:43:02.760
&gt;&gt; David McCollough: Yes.

00:43:02.760 --> 00:43:04.060 position:56%
&gt;&gt; David Rubenstein: -- about people

00:43:04.060 --> 00:43:07.110
who help build the northwest
territories and you are now working

00:43:07.110 --> 00:43:09.110
on a book called, "The
Pioneers," as I mentioned earlier,

00:43:09.110 --> 00:43:11.430
it's going to be out in
2019, what was so unique

00:43:11.430 --> 00:43:18.020
about the northwest territories and
why did those people not give up?

00:43:18.020 --> 00:43:21.830
&gt;&gt; David McCollough: I was invited
the speak at Ohio University

00:43:21.830 --> 00:43:27.420
at their 200th Anniversary
commencement

00:43:27.420 --> 00:43:31.950
and I thought I'd better learn
something about Ohio University

00:43:31.950 --> 00:43:37.480 position:56%
and I found out the oldest building
on campus was called, "Cutler Hall,"

00:43:37.480 --> 00:43:41.280
and I thought, who's Cutler.

00:43:41.280 --> 00:43:48.970
I was told it was oldest
university college building west

00:43:48.970 --> 00:43:51.270
of the Allegheny Mountains.

00:43:52.380 --> 00:43:54.750
Well, Cutler's name
was Manasseh Cutler.

00:43:54.750 --> 00:43:59.240
He was a classic 18th
century poly-math.

00:43:59.240 --> 00:44:04.050
He was a medical doctor,
a lawyer and a minister.

00:44:04.050 --> 00:44:08.000
He was a minister of a small
church in Ipswich, Massachusetts.

00:44:08.000 --> 00:44:16.210
And a group of war veterans
in Ipswich, Massachusetts,

00:44:16.210 --> 00:44:21.320 position:56%
revolutionary war veterans', had the
idea that because they had been paid

00:44:21.320 --> 00:44:25.030
with worthless money all the
time that they served for eight

00:44:25.030 --> 00:44:29.780
and a half years, one
way to compensate

00:44:29.780 --> 00:44:34.550
that would be propriety land in
this new northwest territory,

00:44:34.550 --> 00:44:41.550
seated through our country by the
British at the treaty in Paris,

00:44:41.550 --> 00:44:46.190
and that land was fertile
in a way that nobody

00:44:46.190 --> 00:44:49.960
in New England would have
even imagined, and it belonged

00:44:49.960 --> 00:44:54.930
to a government and there it was.

00:44:54.930 --> 00:45:01.420
This man, Cutler, was picked by
these officers from the war to go

00:45:01.420 --> 00:45:04.730
down to the capital, which
was then in New York,

00:45:04.730 --> 00:45:09.090
and sell them on the idea of
creating a northwest territory,

00:45:09.090 --> 00:45:12.980
ordinance, whereby new
states could be formed.

00:45:12.980 --> 00:45:17.310
Now, Manasseh Cutler had
never lobbied anything

00:45:17.310 --> 00:45:20.330
in anywhere in his life.

00:45:20.330 --> 00:45:22.730
The word "lobbyist" or "lobbying"
had never even entered the

00:45:22.730 --> 00:45:24.230
languages yet.

00:45:24.230 --> 00:45:27.900
He had never been to New York,
never had been to New England,

00:45:27.900 --> 00:45:31.830
but off he went in his
one-horse shay down to New York

00:45:31.830 --> 00:45:33.910
to convince the continental
congress --

00:45:33.910 --> 00:45:37.700
there was no constitution
yet -- to go ahead with this.

00:45:37.700 --> 00:45:41.990
This was the summer of 1787 and
they put the ordinance through.

00:45:41.990 --> 00:45:44.150
He did it -- one man.

00:45:44.150 --> 00:45:45.450
He did it.

00:45:45.450 --> 00:45:50.540
And the ordinance stipulated three
things of immense importance.

00:45:50.540 --> 00:45:53.090
It was one of the most
important bills ever passed

00:45:53.090 --> 00:45:57.060
by our congress even
before we had a president.

00:45:57.060 --> 00:45:59.300
One, there would be
complete freedom of religion,

00:45:59.300 --> 00:46:01.840
absolute complete freedom
of religion.

00:46:01.840 --> 00:46:05.370
The number two, the government
would be involved in education.

00:46:05.370 --> 00:46:09.250
There would public education
all the way through college.

00:46:09.250 --> 00:46:13.200
Hence, the beginning of the state
university system, for example.

00:46:13.200 --> 00:46:18.700
Third, and most important of
all, there would be no slavery.

00:46:18.700 --> 00:46:21.420
Now, what that meant --

00:46:21.420 --> 00:46:24.530
this territory was as big
as all the 13 colonies.

00:46:24.530 --> 00:46:27.060
There were slaves in every
one of the 13 colonies

00:46:27.060 --> 00:46:31.390
but it meant this new empire,
this wilderness empire,

00:46:31.390 --> 00:46:33.560
would be free to everyone.

00:46:33.560 --> 00:46:38.710 position:56%
All you had to do was get across the
Ohio River, the northwest territory

00:46:38.710 --> 00:46:42.910
and west of the Ohio River.

00:46:42.910 --> 00:46:46.620
It now constitutes the
states of Ohio, Indiana,

00:46:46.620 --> 00:46:49.750
Illinois, Michigan and Wisconsin.

00:46:49.750 --> 00:46:53.780
It's as big as all of
France, no slavery.

00:46:53.780 --> 00:46:56.420
So half of our country
would be no slavery.

00:46:56.420 --> 00:47:03.470
Imagine with one vote of congress,
one man put it through and

00:47:03.470 --> 00:47:07.000
yet I never knew anything about it,

00:47:07.000 --> 00:47:09.090
and most people know
nothing about it.

00:47:09.090 --> 00:47:14.010
Now, I go back again
to Thornton Wilder.

00:47:14.010 --> 00:47:24.350 position:56%
Thornton Wilder was once again about
how he got his ideas and so forth,

00:47:24.350 --> 00:47:26.690
but I thought our town was one

00:47:26.690 --> 00:47:29.110
of the greatest things
I ever saw on stage.

00:47:29.110 --> 00:47:33.250
I still love to see it when
it's big and done again.

00:47:33.250 --> 00:47:37.870 position:56%
And I've always wanted to write a
book about people you've never heard

00:47:37.870 --> 00:47:41.170
to see if I can get you
into the tent, as it were,

00:47:41.170 --> 00:47:45.200
without relying on
historic celebrities.

00:47:45.200 --> 00:47:48.540
So none of the characters,
expect one or two,

00:47:48.540 --> 00:47:55.470
are in periphery are people you've
ever heard, but all their letters

00:47:55.470 --> 00:47:59.780
and diaries have survived and their
in the archives at Marietta College

00:47:59.780 --> 00:48:04.400
in Marietta, Ohio and it was as
if I had come into King Tut's tomb

00:48:04.400 --> 00:48:07.400
or something, really and truly.

00:48:07.400 --> 00:48:10.880
And oh my goodness and what they
talk about, and what they reveal,

00:48:10.880 --> 00:48:16.100
and the adversities they faced
and they would not give up.

00:48:16.100 --> 00:48:18.060
&gt;&gt; David Rubenstein: So as we wind

00:48:18.060 --> 00:48:22.040 position:56%
down with the time we have
available, two final questions, one,

00:48:22.040 --> 00:48:25.090
what is the great pleasure of
your life today, as you look back

00:48:25.090 --> 00:48:28.010
on what you've achieved, is
it exposing all these things

00:48:28.010 --> 00:48:30.350
to Americans so they know
more about our history?

00:48:30.350 --> 00:48:32.830
What is it that has given you
the greatest in your life?

00:48:32.830 --> 00:48:35.520
Other than your relationship
with your wife and your children,

00:48:35.520 --> 00:48:37.790
what is the greatest
professional pleasure of your life?

00:48:37.790 --> 00:48:39.590
&gt;&gt; David McCollough:
Being an American.

00:48:39.590 --> 00:48:46.330
[ Applause ]

00:48:46.330 --> 00:48:47.630
&gt;&gt; David McCollough: Thank you.

00:48:47.630 --> 00:48:50.600 position:56%
&gt;&gt; David Rubenstein: And when people
talk about you, the legacy you would

00:48:50.600 --> 00:48:53.940 position:56%
like to have left behind -- not
that you're leaving any time soon --

00:48:53.940 --> 00:48:55.610
but what would say is the legacy

00:48:55.610 --> 00:48:58.370
that you would be most
proud of having achieved?

00:48:58.370 --> 00:49:01.790
&gt;&gt; David McCollough: He
tried to do his best.

00:49:01.790 --> 00:49:04.290
&gt;&gt; David Rubenstein: All right,
well, you've done a terrific job

00:49:04.290 --> 00:49:08.510
and a final thing about
the Library of Congress --

00:49:08.510 --> 00:49:11.430
The Library of Congress is a place
you've done a lot of your research.

00:49:11.430 --> 00:49:15.610
How important is the
Library of Congress to you?

00:49:15.610 --> 00:49:20.130
&gt;&gt; David McCollough: The Library of
Congress is indispensible for me,

00:49:20.130 --> 00:49:28.100 position:56%
professionally, but I also see it as
a shrine on our metropolis devoted

00:49:28.100 --> 00:49:33.560
to the idea of education
and it's available to all.

00:49:33.560 --> 00:49:39.740
Our whole public library system
is something that's a miracle

00:49:39.740 --> 00:49:42.510
of imagined creation.

00:49:42.510 --> 00:49:48.510
[ Applause ]

00:49:48.510 --> 00:49:51.450
The Library of Congress
is the greatest library

00:49:51.450 --> 00:49:54.910
in the world and we did it.

00:49:54.910 --> 00:49:56.210
We did it.

00:49:56.210 --> 00:50:01.700
And if you ever get down
about American culture,

00:50:01.700 --> 00:50:04.180
you might like to remember

00:50:04.180 --> 00:50:07.280
that there are still more
public libraries in this country

00:50:07.280 --> 00:50:08.580
than there are Starbucks.

00:50:08.580 --> 00:50:11.150
&gt;&gt; David Rubenstein:
All right, David,

00:50:11.150 --> 00:50:14.410
thank you very much for
a good conversation.

00:50:14.410 --> 00:50:17.510
&gt;&gt; David McCollough:
Thank you very much.

00:50:17.510 --> 00:50:29.040
[ Applause ]

00:50:29.040 --> 00:50:31.820
This has been a presentation
of the Library of Congress.
