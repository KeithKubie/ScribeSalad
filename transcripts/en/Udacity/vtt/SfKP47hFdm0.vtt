One area where interactive 3D graphics is used extensively is in what's called

00:00:03.905 --> 00:00:07.860
previsualization. That's where a director sets up a virtual world and sets his

00:00:07.860 --> 00:00:12.190
cameras lights and so on. Doing this can cut cost and speed delivery. What

00:00:12.190 --> 00:00:22.495
follows are some interviews with The Third Floor, a previsualization company.

00:00:22.495 --> 00:00:27.630
[MUSIC] The third is a previz studio. We specialize in pre-production of all

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:33.543
types. working with different directors in both commercials video game

00:00:33.543 --> 00:00:38.349
cinematics and feature films. The Third Floor originally was founded up at the

00:00:38.349 --> 00:00:42.780
Sky Walker Ranch. We actually referred to the third floor of that building

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:47.670
where we were. Sequestered for a number of years on Star Wars episode three.t

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:52.840
At the end of our tour duty, we decided to get together and form our own studio

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:59.310
down here in Los Angeles. And Action. We made it a mission of ours to create a

00:00:59.310 --> 00:01:04.849
room where we can have a virtual film making experience. Directors like to work

00:01:04.849 --> 00:01:10.290
with a virtual camera. So we have a system that allows them to manipulate a

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:15.540
camera with a sensor on it. That's fed live into Motion Builder that actually

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:20.525
let's them manipulate around the Motion Builder camera. We have actually added a

00:01:20.525 --> 00:01:26.840
Wacom tablet. And we use that as our viewer. And our input device for operating

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:32.010
a camera inside the virtual world. From there if we do integrate the motion

00:01:32.010 --> 00:01:36.330
capture suit. We can record this information and they can actually create their

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:41.170
own shots. It really is an exploratory process that, that opens up the

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:44.180
directors to whole host of new possibilities.
