program is presented by

00:00:04.323 --> 00:00:06.665
University of California Television.

00:00:18.699 --> 00:00:23.016
(inspirational piano music)

00:00:23.016 --> 00:00:25.896
- [Narrator] We are the paradoxical ape:

00:00:25.896 --> 00:00:28.229
bipedal, naked, large brain,

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:34.706
long the master of fire,
tools, and language,

00:00:34.706 --> 00:00:38.123
but still trying to understand ourselves.

00:00:39.238 --> 00:00:41.821
Aware that death is inevitable,

00:00:42.756 --> 00:00:44.839
yet filled with optimism.

00:00:46.119 --> 00:00:48.404
We grow up slowly.

00:00:48.404 --> 00:00:51.113
We hand down knowledge.

00:00:51.113 --> 00:00:53.196
We empathize and deceive.

00:00:54.501 --> 00:00:57.246
We shape the future from
our shared understanding

00:00:57.246 --> 00:00:58.329
for the past.

00:01:00.017 --> 00:01:03.717
CARTA brings together experts
from diverse disciplines

00:01:03.717 --> 00:01:07.884
to exchange insights on who
we are and how we got here.

00:01:09.783 --> 00:01:13.583
An exploration made possible
by the generosity of humans

00:01:13.583 --> 00:01:14.416
like you.

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:33.473
(bright piano music)

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:04.016
- I have been a professor of medicine

00:02:04.016 --> 00:02:08.522
and a clinical cardiologist
at UCLA for about 25 years,

00:02:08.522 --> 00:02:11.932
but about 12 years ago,
I got a telephone call

00:02:11.932 --> 00:02:14.713
that changed my life,
and that call came from

00:02:14.713 --> 00:02:17.846
one of the veterinarians
at the Los Angeles Zoo,

00:02:17.846 --> 00:02:21.656
and he called me because
one of their chimpanzees

00:02:21.656 --> 00:02:24.119
had woken up with a facial droop.

00:02:24.119 --> 00:02:27.163
They were concerned that
she might have had a stroke

00:02:27.163 --> 00:02:28.854
and he asked if I'd come to the zoo

00:02:28.854 --> 00:02:31.522
and image her heart to
look for blood clots

00:02:31.522 --> 00:02:33.538
and other things that
might've been the problem,

00:02:33.538 --> 00:02:36.257
and this was the hospital
at the zoo that I went to.

00:02:36.257 --> 00:02:40.456
And this is actually me with
my first non-human animal,

00:02:40.456 --> 00:02:43.131
and I'm gonna come back
to her in just a moment,

00:02:43.131 --> 00:02:46.451
but a few weeks after I
visited with this chimpanzee,

00:02:46.451 --> 00:02:51.095
I was asked to rule out a
torn aorta in a gorilla.

00:02:51.095 --> 00:02:55.468
And not long after that,
there was a California condor

00:02:55.468 --> 00:02:57.672
that they noted a heart murmur in

00:02:57.672 --> 00:02:59.389
and they asked if I would look to see

00:02:59.389 --> 00:03:01.903
whether one of the valves was torn,

00:03:01.903 --> 00:03:03.390
which in fact it was.

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:06.601
There was a California
sea lion whose lower body

00:03:06.601 --> 00:03:09.321
had filled with fluid
and they were concerned

00:03:09.321 --> 00:03:12.968
about congestive heart
failure and asked if I'd come,

00:03:12.968 --> 00:03:17.170
and in this picture, I'm
listening to the heart of a lion

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:22.053
who had had a collection
of over 700 cc's of fluid

00:03:22.053 --> 00:03:25.661
in the sac in which
her heart is contained,

00:03:25.661 --> 00:03:28.226
and in a collaborative procedure involving

00:03:28.226 --> 00:03:31.295
veterinarians and human cardiologists,

00:03:31.295 --> 00:03:34.004
we drained the fluid from her heart,

00:03:34.004 --> 00:03:35.963
and this, by the way, is a
procedure that I have done

00:03:35.963 --> 00:03:40.101
on hundreds of human
patients, but I must say that

00:03:40.101 --> 00:03:42.934
the procedure itself was identical

00:03:43.791 --> 00:03:46.239
to the procedure that I've done on humans,

00:03:46.239 --> 00:03:48.737
with the exception of this

00:03:48.737 --> 00:03:50.984
(audience laughs)

00:03:50.984 --> 00:03:53.908
and, where is it, there we go, and that.

00:03:53.908 --> 00:03:56.422
Let's get back to my first
patient, this chimpanzee

00:03:56.422 --> 00:03:58.446
who had had the suspected stroke.

00:03:58.446 --> 00:04:00.372
I remember when I first put the probe

00:04:00.372 --> 00:04:03.293
into her mouth and slid
it down the esophagus,

00:04:03.293 --> 00:04:06.496
I turned to the screen
and this is what I saw,

00:04:06.496 --> 00:04:08.351
a four-chambered beating heart,

00:04:08.351 --> 00:04:11.346
a left ventricle, a right
ventricle, two atria,

00:04:11.346 --> 00:04:14.044
but I noticed that there were blood clots

00:04:14.044 --> 00:04:16.442
moving these round, bouncing balls

00:04:16.442 --> 00:04:19.829
and that the upper chambers were enlarged.

00:04:19.829 --> 00:04:22.071
And as soon as I saw that picture,

00:04:22.071 --> 00:04:24.332
it reminded me of a human
patient I had imaged

00:04:24.332 --> 00:04:28.932
at UCLA some weeks before
who had the enlarged atria

00:04:28.932 --> 00:04:33.057
and the blood clots, and I
realized that these two patients,

00:04:33.057 --> 00:04:36.887
one human and one chimpanzee,
had spontaneously developed

00:04:36.887 --> 00:04:39.768
the same kind of
infiltrative heart failure

00:04:39.768 --> 00:04:44.369
that I had been treating for
years with high technology

00:04:44.369 --> 00:04:47.681
and advanced pharmaceuticals,
and I found myself

00:04:47.681 --> 00:04:49.750
being a little bit surprised.

00:04:49.750 --> 00:04:53.585
But then I was more curious
about why I was surprised.

00:04:53.585 --> 00:04:55.337
I mean I certainly knew that we shared

00:04:55.337 --> 00:04:58.045
a common ancestor with chimpanzees between

00:04:58.045 --> 00:04:59.957
five and seven million years ago,

00:04:59.957 --> 00:05:02.760
which of course is a blink in the scope

00:05:02.760 --> 00:05:06.340
of evolutionary time,
and as an undergraduate,

00:05:06.340 --> 00:05:07.635
I had worked for four years in

00:05:07.635 --> 00:05:10.477
a Museum of Comparative Zoology.

00:05:10.477 --> 00:05:12.031
But when I had gone to medical school,

00:05:12.031 --> 00:05:14.094
and like most medical students today,

00:05:14.094 --> 00:05:16.520
what I had learned the connection between

00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:20.103
animal and human health
was was infectious,

00:05:20.951 --> 00:05:22.701
pathogenic, zoonotic.

00:05:24.036 --> 00:05:25.816
And of course there is no question

00:05:25.816 --> 00:05:28.607
that animals play an important role

00:05:28.607 --> 00:05:30.732
in the transmission of diseases that have

00:05:30.732 --> 00:05:33.770
a high impact on human communities,

00:05:33.770 --> 00:05:36.680
even more so now, the One Health Community

00:05:36.680 --> 00:05:40.216
is helping us realize that
the majority of infections

00:05:40.216 --> 00:05:42.559
that will impact human populations

00:05:42.559 --> 00:05:45.883
are coming from animal reservoirs,

00:05:45.883 --> 00:05:48.797
but what I didn't learn, and
most medical students don't,

00:05:48.797 --> 00:05:52.522
is that the father of modern
medicine, Sir William Osler,

00:05:52.522 --> 00:05:56.910
is also considered the father
of modern veterinary medicine

00:05:56.910 --> 00:05:58.861
and that one of his teachers,

00:05:58.861 --> 00:06:01.926
the father of modern
pathology, Rudolf Virchow,

00:06:01.926 --> 00:06:04.244
wrote in the 19th century, "Between animal

00:06:04.244 --> 00:06:06.908
"and human medicine,
there is no dividing line,

00:06:06.908 --> 00:06:08.069
"nor should there be.

00:06:08.069 --> 00:06:10.508
"The object is different,
but the experience obtained

00:06:10.508 --> 00:06:13.676
"constitutes the basis of all medicine."

00:06:13.676 --> 00:06:16.482
But what I was finding
was that while I was

00:06:16.482 --> 00:06:20.090
taking care of my human patients at UCLA,

00:06:20.090 --> 00:06:22.299
I would go to the zoo and I would hear

00:06:22.299 --> 00:06:24.649
the veterinarians discuss the management

00:06:24.649 --> 00:06:27.012
of metastatic breast cancer,

00:06:27.012 --> 00:06:30.522
or the management of brittle diabetes,

00:06:30.522 --> 00:06:35.403
or the dosage of serotonin
reuptake inhibitor drugs

00:06:35.403 --> 00:06:38.545
like Prozac for some of their
patients who were anxious

00:06:38.545 --> 00:06:42.985
or compulsive, and I
realized that as much as

00:06:42.985 --> 00:06:45.780
I knew about human
medicine, I knew so little

00:06:45.780 --> 00:06:48.469
about veterinary
medicine, and it turns out

00:06:48.469 --> 00:06:53.127
there has been a gulf
between these two fields.

00:06:53.127 --> 00:06:54.613
Now there are many reasons for that,

00:06:54.613 --> 00:06:56.710
some are historical, some are cultural,

00:06:56.710 --> 00:06:59.522
but I'm gonna focus on two for a moment.

00:06:59.522 --> 00:07:02.715
This first, I believe, has to do with

00:07:02.715 --> 00:07:05.938
our essential ambivalence about embracing

00:07:05.938 --> 00:07:09.021
our own animal natures, but the other

00:07:10.895 --> 00:07:13.635
is human exceptionalism.

00:07:13.635 --> 00:07:16.940
We all are scientists, many
of us are scientists here,

00:07:16.940 --> 00:07:18.898
and we theoretically
accept that human beings

00:07:18.898 --> 00:07:22.883
are merely one species in a
spectrum of other species,

00:07:22.883 --> 00:07:26.592
not uniquely unique, but
unique like all others.

00:07:26.592 --> 00:07:27.425
Love this.

00:07:28.374 --> 00:07:31.374
We can zone in and see, here we are.

00:07:32.316 --> 00:07:36.450
And yet, and yet, even the most
scientifically-minded of us

00:07:36.450 --> 00:07:40.283
may harbor some residual
human exceptionalism.

00:07:41.858 --> 00:07:45.565
In fact, I believe there
is a medical expression

00:07:45.565 --> 00:07:48.249
of human exceptionalism
which is contributing

00:07:48.249 --> 00:07:51.045
to this gulf between the fields,

00:07:51.045 --> 00:07:53.317
and I became curious.

00:07:53.317 --> 00:07:56.048
What is the extent of the
overlap in the pathology

00:07:56.048 --> 00:07:58.219
of humans and animals, and so I asked,

00:07:58.219 --> 00:08:01.060
do non-human animals develop?

00:08:01.060 --> 00:08:02.671
Heart attacks or heart failure?

00:08:02.671 --> 00:08:04.615
Type I, Type II diabetes?

00:08:04.615 --> 00:08:06.684
Brain tumors, concussions, strokes,

00:08:06.684 --> 00:08:08.920
asthma, allergies,
breast cancer, leukemia,

00:08:08.920 --> 00:08:12.522
infertility, painful
periods, sexual dysfunction?

00:08:12.522 --> 00:08:13.856
And of course the answer to every one

00:08:13.856 --> 00:08:16.109
of those questions is yes.

00:08:16.109 --> 00:08:19.109
Now, of course, our bad human habits

00:08:20.095 --> 00:08:22.707
amplify the risk of disease.

00:08:22.707 --> 00:08:25.153
It is the basis of preventative medicine

00:08:25.153 --> 00:08:28.837
and I have spent 25 years
encouraging improved diets

00:08:28.837 --> 00:08:33.271
and more activity, and yet,
although our bad human habits

00:08:33.271 --> 00:08:35.722
may increase the risk of disease,

00:08:35.722 --> 00:08:40.604
the essential vulnerability
to disease is ancient.

00:08:40.604 --> 00:08:43.222
Let's quickly talk about two big killers:

00:08:43.222 --> 00:08:45.676
breast cancer and heart disease.

00:08:45.676 --> 00:08:48.858
We know that breast cancer
has a high human impact

00:08:48.858 --> 00:08:50.193
on the human community.

00:08:50.193 --> 00:08:53.193
It's the leading cancer among women,

00:08:54.192 --> 00:08:57.113
but breast cancer is not unique to humans.

00:08:57.113 --> 00:08:59.795
In fact, many of you who have cats

00:08:59.795 --> 00:09:01.483
may know that cats are at risk,

00:09:01.483 --> 00:09:03.001
dogs can be as well.

00:09:03.001 --> 00:09:05.232
This is a mastectomy scar from a cat

00:09:05.232 --> 00:09:09.160
whose owner felt a mass
when she was petting her,

00:09:09.160 --> 00:09:12.056
and in fact, breast cancer has been found

00:09:12.056 --> 00:09:14.973
in mammals of almost every variety,

00:09:16.618 --> 00:09:21.011
from polar bears, to
elephants, to marsupials,

00:09:21.011 --> 00:09:24.396
llamas, marine mammals, beluga whales.

00:09:24.396 --> 00:09:26.569
In fact, notably, there seems to be

00:09:26.569 --> 00:09:29.086
a particularly high rate of breast cancer

00:09:29.086 --> 00:09:31.574
among some big cats.

00:09:31.574 --> 00:09:33.312
We can talk about that another time,

00:09:33.312 --> 00:09:35.365
why that might be, but it's notable,

00:09:35.365 --> 00:09:38.335
one fascinating connection is that

00:09:38.335 --> 00:09:41.524
the reason that some
jaguars have a particularly

00:09:41.524 --> 00:09:45.356
elevated rate of breast
cancer is probably related

00:09:45.356 --> 00:09:48.053
to a mutation of the BRCA1 gene,

00:09:48.053 --> 00:09:51.945
and it is the same mutation
that makes some human females

00:09:51.945 --> 00:09:54.377
at elevated risk for breast cancer.

00:09:54.377 --> 00:09:56.453
Now of course there are
regions of the world

00:09:56.453 --> 00:10:00.861
where practices, habits,
genetics, diet are different

00:10:00.861 --> 00:10:04.398
and the rates of breast cancer are lower,

00:10:04.398 --> 00:10:06.818
but that merely underscores the fact

00:10:06.818 --> 00:10:09.299
that while our bad human
habits may increase

00:10:09.299 --> 00:10:13.011
the risk of our disease,
the essential vulnerability

00:10:13.011 --> 00:10:15.311
to disease is ancient.

00:10:15.311 --> 00:10:19.392
The age of mammals started
about 200 million years ago,

00:10:19.392 --> 00:10:22.579
and I suspect that the
vulnerability, therefore,

00:10:22.579 --> 00:10:25.949
to breast cancer can
be stated, in a sense,

00:10:25.949 --> 00:10:27.699
to be as old as that.

00:10:29.245 --> 00:10:31.374
What about heart attacks?

00:10:31.374 --> 00:10:34.831
So cardiovascular disease,
it is the number one cause

00:10:34.831 --> 00:10:36.765
of death globally.

00:10:36.765 --> 00:10:41.114
In the United States, those
statistics are amplified,

00:10:41.114 --> 00:10:43.346
and we know that most
heart attacks are caused

00:10:43.346 --> 00:10:46.653
by the progressive build
up of atherosclerosis

00:10:46.653 --> 00:10:50.137
in the arteries that
eventually that atherosclerosis

00:10:50.137 --> 00:10:53.533
breaks, there is a blood clot that ceases

00:10:53.533 --> 00:10:55.739
the flow of blood through the artery,

00:10:55.739 --> 00:10:57.460
and the muscle downstream dies.

00:10:57.460 --> 00:11:00.906
And in this section of an artery,

00:11:00.906 --> 00:11:03.563
you see the atherosclerosis, the plaque.

00:11:03.563 --> 00:11:06.114
It has fractured, there is a blood clot,

00:11:06.114 --> 00:11:09.510
and this individual died of a stroke.

00:11:09.510 --> 00:11:11.985
But this individual was not a human.

00:11:11.985 --> 00:11:15.154
What we see here is an Egyptian Vulture

00:11:15.154 --> 00:11:17.983
flying in the base of the Himalayans,

00:11:17.983 --> 00:11:21.409
and it turns out that if
you look at a phylogeny

00:11:21.409 --> 00:11:24.742
of atherosclerosis across avian species,

00:11:26.702 --> 00:11:28.627
every place that there is a star,

00:11:28.627 --> 00:11:31.310
there's at least one
species within this order

00:11:31.310 --> 00:11:34.058
in whom atherosclerosis, and stroke,

00:11:34.058 --> 00:11:38.225
heart attack, and other clinical
syndromes have been seen.

00:11:39.288 --> 00:11:42.910
Now, of course our bad
human habits amplify

00:11:42.910 --> 00:11:43.802
the risk of disease.

00:11:43.802 --> 00:11:46.994
I've spent my life as a
clinician helping patients

00:11:46.994 --> 00:11:49.067
modify their lifestyles.

00:11:49.067 --> 00:11:50.839
We know that.

00:11:50.839 --> 00:11:53.398
We know that bad human
habits do contribute

00:11:53.398 --> 00:11:57.933
to heart disease, but
recognizing that atherosclerosis,

00:11:57.933 --> 00:12:00.990
and heart attacks, and
strokes have been identified

00:12:00.990 --> 00:12:05.045
in animals as varied
as walruses, dolphins,

00:12:05.045 --> 00:12:09.378
camels, and of course
humans, suggests that

00:12:09.378 --> 00:12:12.747
while bad human habits may
amplify the risk of disease,

00:12:12.747 --> 00:12:15.842
the essential vulnerability is ancient.

00:12:15.842 --> 00:12:20.009
And again, the timeline
pointing to atherosclerosis.

00:12:20.902 --> 00:12:24.360
And if this is true of
the somatic diseases

00:12:24.360 --> 00:12:27.664
like heart attack and breast cancer,

00:12:27.664 --> 00:12:30.357
it is also true for mental illnesses.

00:12:30.357 --> 00:12:32.129
There is a hair-plucking
syndrome seen here

00:12:32.129 --> 00:12:34.840
in this picture where
people pluck out the hair

00:12:34.840 --> 00:12:38.909
of their eyelashes, of
any part of their body,

00:12:38.909 --> 00:12:40.750
but it is remarkable that this bears

00:12:40.750 --> 00:12:44.319
a similarity to a hair-plucking
and feather-plucking

00:12:44.319 --> 00:12:48.395
syndrome that is seen
in some bird species.

00:12:48.395 --> 00:12:51.188
You can see that this
parrot has plucked, denuded,

00:12:51.188 --> 00:12:52.105
his thorax.

00:12:52.953 --> 00:12:56.705
And it is notable that the
compulsive tail-chasing

00:12:56.705 --> 00:13:00.646
seen in bull terriers,
treatable with Prozac,

00:13:00.646 --> 00:13:03.605
or the flank-sucking, the
compulsive flank-sucking

00:13:03.605 --> 00:13:07.395
seen in dobermans, treatable with Prozac,

00:13:07.395 --> 00:13:11.829
bears similarities to
the compulsive behaviors

00:13:11.829 --> 00:13:16.278
we see in some humans with
obsessive-compulsive disorder.

00:13:16.278 --> 00:13:19.007
And it is notable, that
like some human beings

00:13:19.007 --> 00:13:22.538
with anorexia nervosa,
some non-human animals

00:13:22.538 --> 00:13:25.658
respond to social stress
by starving themselves,

00:13:25.658 --> 00:13:29.291
sometimes to death, while
others deal with stress

00:13:29.291 --> 00:13:32.377
by causing themselves to regurgitate.

00:13:32.377 --> 00:13:36.019
Our bad human habits may
increase our risk of disease,

00:13:36.019 --> 00:13:40.370
but the essential vulnerability
to disease is ancient.

00:13:40.370 --> 00:13:42.203
Why is this important?

00:13:43.385 --> 00:13:45.768
There are scientific and medical advances

00:13:45.768 --> 00:13:48.718
that can come of thinking comparatively,

00:13:48.718 --> 00:13:51.047
looking across species.

00:13:51.047 --> 00:13:54.126
Translational medicine traditionally means

00:13:54.126 --> 00:13:57.506
taking research that is
being done at the bench,

00:13:57.506 --> 00:14:00.559
in the laboratory, and
bringing it to the bedside.

00:14:00.559 --> 00:14:03.641
But I would suggest that
there is another way

00:14:03.641 --> 00:14:06.870
of working translationally, and that is by

00:14:06.870 --> 00:14:10.862
looking across species and
across time for connections

00:14:10.862 --> 00:14:14.187
that generate novel
hypotheses that can ultimately

00:14:14.187 --> 00:14:18.762
be translated into science
that can save lives.

00:14:18.762 --> 00:14:22.929
Furthermore, I believe these
insights have the potential

00:14:23.981 --> 00:14:27.999
to reduce stigma and increase compassion

00:14:27.999 --> 00:14:29.971
for people suffering from physical illness

00:14:29.971 --> 00:14:31.554
and mental illness.

00:14:32.949 --> 00:14:35.931
I would like to end by modifying the words

00:14:35.931 --> 00:14:38.614
of the late, great Susan Sontag

00:14:38.614 --> 00:14:43.270
to reflect the species-spanning
nature of health

00:14:43.270 --> 00:14:46.798
and disease, and the deep
and ancient connection

00:14:46.798 --> 00:14:50.491
we all share, not just
with other human beings,

00:14:50.491 --> 00:14:54.231
but with all of the
patients on the planet.

00:14:54.231 --> 00:14:58.064
She wrote, "Illness is
the night side of life.

00:14:59.547 --> 00:15:04.393
"More onerous citizenship,
everyone and everything

00:15:04.393 --> 00:15:07.349
"who is born holds dual citizenship

00:15:07.349 --> 00:15:11.582
"in the kingdom of the well
and in the kingdom of the sick,

00:15:11.582 --> 00:15:15.058
"and although we all prefer
to use the good passport,

00:15:15.058 --> 00:15:17.555
"sooner or later, each of us is obliged

00:15:17.555 --> 00:15:22.543
"to identify ourselves as
citizens of that other place."

00:15:22.543 --> 00:15:24.241
Thank you for your attention.

00:15:24.241 --> 00:15:27.324
