It was awesome, seeing all those users in those interviews

00:00:03.310 --> 00:00:05.924
because, as developers, when we write code, we just commit

00:00:05.924 --> 00:00:08.670
it to, some repository and we don't actually get to

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:11.620
see end users actually use the products that we make.

00:00:11.620 --> 00:00:13.660
&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's interesting to hear them describe the things

00:00:13.660 --> 00:00:16.180
they like and don't like about applications in their own words.

00:00:16.180 --> 00:00:16.670
&gt;&gt; Yeah, exactly.

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:18.640
&gt;&gt; I thought it was really cool that, although,

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:20.620
those users were very different they seemed to have a

00:00:20.620 --> 00:00:22.570
lot of things in common. I know. We're going to have

00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:25.324
a lot of fun, talking about this in Lesson Two.
