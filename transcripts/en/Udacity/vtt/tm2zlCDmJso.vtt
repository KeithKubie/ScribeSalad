00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:04.059
Well, if we want to send each of these four points 20 units to the right, we

00:00:04.059 --> 00:00:10.568
just set 20 to all the x coordinates. So this first point at 50, 0 will now be

00:00:10.568 --> 00:00:18.430
at 70, 0. This point at 0, -50 will now be at 20, -50. And this point, we'll

00:00:18.430 --> 00:00:23.928
move to negative 30, comma 0. And finally the point 0, 50, we'll move 20 units

00:00:23.928 --> 00:00:29.447
to the right, so we add 20 to 0, giving us the point 20, comma 50.
