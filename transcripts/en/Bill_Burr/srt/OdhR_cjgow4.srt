1
00:00:02,650 --> 00:00:06,070
Hey, what's going on? It's Bill Burr.
It's time for the Thursday afternoon.

2
00:00:06,071 --> 00:00:10,960
Just before Friday. Monday
morning podcasts. And I've
just checking in on you.

3
00:00:11,660 --> 00:00:15,940
All right? I can't even tell you what a
great mood I was in seven minutes ago,

4
00:00:17,170 --> 00:00:21,520
seven minutes ago. Everything was fucking
fine. And then what happens? What happens

5
00:00:23,360 --> 00:00:27,190
in my whole technology fucking
worlds? It just, you know,

6
00:00:27,280 --> 00:00:28,750
Internet's not working.

7
00:00:29,050 --> 00:00:32,530
I got to go into the one room in my house
where the Internet works for whatever

8
00:00:32,531 --> 00:00:37,120
fucking reason. Uh, you
know, it's a cloudy day.

9
00:00:38,110 --> 00:00:41,350
Uh, you gotta upgrade your fucking
something or other, you know,

10
00:00:42,970 --> 00:00:44,590
all I wanted to see,
you know,

11
00:00:44,591 --> 00:00:48,820
I found out that Liverpool lost the cup
final and I know what all you assholes

12
00:00:48,970 --> 00:00:52,230
and of folk do you find out
now you know why? You know,

13
00:00:52,250 --> 00:00:56,050
I just found out now because I
have American Internet. Okay?

14
00:00:56,920 --> 00:01:00,100
Do you know how many pages I have to
scroll through to find fucking soccer

15
00:01:00,101 --> 00:01:03,160
highlights? Immediates it's after
the German scat films. Okay.

16
00:01:03,190 --> 00:01:05,680
That's where the fuck it is in
this country. And by the way,

17
00:01:05,830 --> 00:01:07,450
I found out that most solid guy

18
00:01:08,980 --> 00:01:12,170
got his shoulder yank out by some
content on the other team. And,

19
00:01:12,440 --> 00:01:16,180
and good luck trying to find a
video of the actual goddamn play.

20
00:01:17,470 --> 00:01:18,131
I swear to God,

21
00:01:18,131 --> 00:01:22,180
I want to fucking find every content out
there that is acting like they have the

22
00:01:22,181 --> 00:01:22,901
video.
Do you don't,

23
00:01:22,901 --> 00:01:27,760
one of the websites I went to head
it had the silence of the crowd.

24
00:01:27,880 --> 00:01:30,850
That was the video. I don't
want to fucking see that.
I want to see the injury.

25
00:01:35,620 --> 00:01:39,580
Fuck. I will sit there and look at some
fat cunt crying over his fish and chips.

26
00:01:39,700 --> 00:01:41,860
I want to see what happened.
Cause this,

27
00:01:41,861 --> 00:01:46,270
the picture that I saw looked like that
guy grabbed it. Pulled the Kelly Olynyk.

28
00:01:47,310 --> 00:01:48,080
Yeah,

29
00:01:48,080 --> 00:01:50,630
you fucking grabbed onto the
thing and fucking yanked it out.

30
00:01:52,060 --> 00:01:53,200
MMM.
[inaudible]

31
00:01:54,150 --> 00:01:58,980
anyways, uh, let me look. What kind
of fucking world do you live in?

32
00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:00,490
Okay.

33
00:02:00,490 --> 00:02:03,840
We are trying to get more money off of
advertising by pulling some shit like

34
00:02:03,841 --> 00:02:08,730
that. Swear to fucking gold again. Legal.

35
00:02:08,930 --> 00:02:10,240
We'll have flooded edge babbled.

36
00:02:10,450 --> 00:02:13,720
We'll have them walking out of the
stadium with his fucking arm in a sling.

37
00:02:16,910 --> 00:02:21,530
Hey, yeah, you got, you got,
you got the Zapruder film.
Ah, yeah, we got it. You know,

38
00:02:21,531 --> 00:02:26,410
what do they do? Huh? They
show somebody fucking with the,

39
00:02:26,570 --> 00:02:30,170
their hand over their mouth. They don't
show the actual fucking assassination.

40
00:02:33,900 --> 00:02:37,990
Um, God, I was in such a good
fucking mood since such a great mood.

41
00:02:38,620 --> 00:02:42,370
You know, I woke up, daughter woke
me up. Who's kidding? Who Right.

42
00:02:42,371 --> 00:02:45,280
Made a breakfast as I always do.
We had a great time.

43
00:02:45,281 --> 00:02:49,090
We sang the Etsy petsy spider 5,000 times.
I was in a great mood.

44
00:02:50,260 --> 00:02:54,580
And then for whatever reason, my stupid
recorder, the metronome got turned on.

45
00:02:54,581 --> 00:02:56,620
I did not to turn that off. So, uh,

46
00:02:56,650 --> 00:03:00,340
rather than relaxing and trying to
figure it out, I broke my headphones.

47
00:03:01,780 --> 00:03:04,360
Can you believe it like this?
This all all unraveled. You don't,

48
00:03:04,361 --> 00:03:06,490
my wife loved me seven minutes ago.

49
00:03:10,090 --> 00:03:14,440
I'm turning 50 and I'm still behaving
like this. I just broke one of my toys,

50
00:03:15,130 --> 00:03:16,660
like a goddamn toddler.

51
00:03:17,320 --> 00:03:20,950
Do you guys realize that that's
you're listening to a child?

52
00:03:20,980 --> 00:03:24,280
Maybe that's why God had me go bald
because I was acting like a baby.

53
00:03:24,281 --> 00:03:27,910
He wanted me to look
like one big old baby,

54
00:03:28,690 --> 00:03:32,410
a big old bearded baby. I should
be down in Coney island. Right.

55
00:03:32,411 --> 00:03:36,310
And they should just have me and one of
the cages next to the bearded lady and

56
00:03:36,311 --> 00:03:40,000
just have me trying to fucking figure
out something that involves any remote

57
00:03:40,030 --> 00:03:44,950
basic technology. You know,
look at that big old angry baby.

58
00:03:45,010 --> 00:03:47,050
He's 50 years old,
but you wouldn't know it.

59
00:03:47,051 --> 00:03:50,500
And just watching me break in
fucking headphones and recorders.

60
00:03:52,570 --> 00:03:53,403
Ah God.

61
00:03:54,490 --> 00:03:58,060
And I'd love to tell you that turn 50th
is profound thing and that I'm going to

62
00:03:58,061 --> 00:04:00,280
change, but I swear to God
I'm not, I'm going to be,

63
00:04:00,281 --> 00:04:04,960
I'm going to be breaking my walkers when
I'm fucking 90 and I'm gonna sit 80 and

64
00:04:04,961 --> 00:04:07,280
then I bumped it up to 90
cause I just said walkers,

65
00:04:09,310 --> 00:04:11,310
there's no fucking way, you
know, speaking of which, um,

66
00:04:11,311 --> 00:04:14,560
I'm back to working out again yet another
time attempting with the shoulder.

67
00:04:14,820 --> 00:04:15,990
Cause I,
I'm impatient and I,

68
00:04:15,991 --> 00:04:20,770
I moved to up too quickly in weight
and I re aggravate my shoulder.

69
00:04:20,771 --> 00:04:24,790
I don't hurt it again. I just aggravate
it. But, uh, I really do miss,

70
00:04:25,690 --> 00:04:28,930
I miss working out and lifting
weights and all that shit.

71
00:04:28,931 --> 00:04:33,220
Getting a little pump going, you know.
So I'm doing it with very lightweight,

72
00:04:33,790 --> 00:04:38,290
like put it this way, this is
how light the dumbbells are. Uh,

73
00:04:38,350 --> 00:04:43,330
my dumbbells are,
are like pink baby blue.

74
00:04:44,140 --> 00:04:48,850
I have one pound, it's a girls. I have uh,

75
00:04:48,970 --> 00:04:53,720
three pounds. It's a boy,
right? Are those, no,

76
00:04:53,721 --> 00:04:56,950
I don't wait. No two pound,
two pounds or purple.

77
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:02,650
I got the purple rain to pounders
the, it's a girl, one pounder.

78
00:05:03,010 --> 00:05:03,791
And then I got the,

79
00:05:03,791 --> 00:05:08,791
it's a boy five pounder
and then I got a six pound

80
00:05:11,070 --> 00:05:15,130
that the color their orange.
Right.

81
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:19,870
It's like I'm living, I'm working
out with Fisher price weights here.

82
00:05:21,490 --> 00:05:22,930
Um,
anyways,

83
00:05:22,931 --> 00:05:26,480
but I got that TRX band and that things
kind of been saving me a little bit. Um,

84
00:05:27,430 --> 00:05:28,750
it's weird. I can't, like,

85
00:05:29,710 --> 00:05:32,830
I can't bring wait up to the
side out and up to the side.

86
00:05:32,860 --> 00:05:36,250
W like much more than three pounds
is Henri aggravate my shoulder.

87
00:05:36,490 --> 00:05:40,930
But for some reason I can do 50 pushups.
Um,

88
00:05:41,890 --> 00:05:44,350
and I don't know why I just told you
that because now every person who is even

89
00:05:44,351 --> 00:05:47,380
remotely a personal trainer, you know,
they're going to start giving me advice.

90
00:05:47,470 --> 00:05:52,470
You can't bring up dogs working out or uh,

91
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:56,110
I don't know. Something else. How
to shade your beaver. I don't,

92
00:05:56,111 --> 00:05:58,670
I don't fucking know. You always need
three examples. I'm sorry, I choked.

93
00:05:58,671 --> 00:06:01,630
I ran out of, out of thinks
they're anyways, did you,

94
00:06:01,631 --> 00:06:05,970
have you guys been watching the
Stanley Cup final? Not Finals,

95
00:06:05,990 --> 00:06:10,580
the NBA finals start tonight,
but the standing Stanley Cup final,

96
00:06:11,150 --> 00:06:12,620
the first two games in Las Vegas.

97
00:06:12,621 --> 00:06:17,621
And I got to tell you something I really
wanted to hate on the intro that the

98
00:06:18,051 --> 00:06:19,390
vikings, the Vikings, the,

99
00:06:19,460 --> 00:06:24,460
the nights the Vegas Knights had that
game of Thrones shit that they were doing.

100
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:31,040
Uh, but I get it. I get it. It's
Vegas. They got to put on a show.

101
00:06:31,070 --> 00:06:34,060
They can't have strippers out
there because there's kids there.

102
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:35,840
It was a kid friendly Vegas show.

103
00:06:35,870 --> 00:06:39,080
I thought that shit that they were
doing on the ice was amazing. But uh,

104
00:06:39,530 --> 00:06:44,330
it was kind of funny how, I remember
in the NBA when guys would dunk,

105
00:06:44,390 --> 00:06:47,470
Aka black guys would dunk and
then they would do make that,

106
00:06:47,471 --> 00:06:48,920
that motion across the neck.

107
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:50,900
Like we just slit your throat
and they will like that.

108
00:06:50,901 --> 00:06:53,870
Still violate that a is that a gang side?

109
00:06:54,110 --> 00:06:58,100
They can't deal that any by right.
And then you turn on hockey. It's a,

110
00:06:58,101 --> 00:07:02,270
basically a bunch of white people there
are out there dressed like nights than

111
00:07:02,271 --> 00:07:04,100
not even Miami and going across the neck,

112
00:07:04,250 --> 00:07:07,940
they literally have a fucking
sword right across the neck.

113
00:07:07,941 --> 00:07:10,100
Does all those kids there?
You know what I mean?

114
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:15,140
Maybe because he's dressed up like a,
a night or something. Maybe, you know,

115
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:20,000
I have no fucking idea. But anyways,
uh, the games have been outstanding.

116
00:07:21,050 --> 00:07:25,490
Uh, it's really hard to root against
the Vegas Knights with that story,

117
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:30,520
whatever that GM or that coach said at
the beginning of the year than being an

118
00:07:30,521 --> 00:07:32,690
expansion franchise.
He said to the players,

119
00:07:32,691 --> 00:07:34,740
all of you are here for the same reason.

120
00:07:35,540 --> 00:07:38,570
Whoever you were just playing with
didn't think you were worthy of being

121
00:07:38,571 --> 00:07:40,140
protected.
Something like that.

122
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:44,090
And that's like the beginning of all
those fucking movies. Well, you know,

123
00:07:44,091 --> 00:07:46,790
they're going to win the championship,
you know,

124
00:07:47,820 --> 00:07:51,470
sneak away from the Nazis like that
Sylvester Stallone movie where they played

125
00:07:51,471 --> 00:07:55,370
soccer. Right. That's what the, how
this whole thing's playing out. But

126
00:07:56,990 --> 00:08:00,980
uh, I've become a capitals fan just
because I've been hanging with Josh,

127
00:08:00,981 --> 00:08:02,600
Adam Meyers all these years,

128
00:08:03,290 --> 00:08:07,550
so I got to root for is capitals
plus they've been waiting since 1974.

129
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:13,220
Who gives a shit? It's been great. Hockey.
I loved, uh, the shootout in game one.

130
00:08:14,060 --> 00:08:16,460
Um,
as far as 10 goals being scored,

131
00:08:17,420 --> 00:08:19,790
I was blown away by how fast,
uh,

132
00:08:19,820 --> 00:08:24,080
Vegas was and just how relentless
there for check was. But, um,

133
00:08:25,790 --> 00:08:29,390
and I did like that the uh,
capitol stuck up for a Tj,

134
00:08:29,870 --> 00:08:32,540
Yoshi and knocked that one guy
in the nights on his fucking ass,

135
00:08:33,470 --> 00:08:35,180
which he got off easy by the way,

136
00:08:35,450 --> 00:08:40,370
compared to what the fuck you guys
had been doing at to a Tj Oci.

137
00:08:40,370 --> 00:08:43,550
They just decided that we're going to
going to fucking go after this guy. Huh?

138
00:08:45,170 --> 00:08:49,890
Is that what it is? Because he's getting
facewash slash boarded crosscheck.

139
00:08:50,030 --> 00:08:53,990
Then he finally fucking snaps and takes
a dump penalty. What's that guy? Well,

140
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:56,400
set needs to come out and
beat the fuck out of somebody.

141
00:08:56,520 --> 00:09:00,840
But I loved how the capitols in the
second game played a really physical game

142
00:09:00,841 --> 00:09:05,280
and they slowed them down and um,
and Jesus Christ,

143
00:09:05,281 --> 00:09:06,210
that fucking safe.

144
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:11,240
That is the save of that might've saved
like if the capital's win the Stanley

145
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:15,490
Cup, he got us to say right there that,
that, that fucking saved. They go,

146
00:09:15,540 --> 00:09:17,070
they go back to Washington.

147
00:09:18,780 --> 00:09:21,870
I'm going to go out on a limb here and
say really obvious stuff out there.

148
00:09:22,020 --> 00:09:24,000
They got a big uphill climb to skate.

149
00:09:26,730 --> 00:09:30,630
Although the Cavaliers were down o two
to the Celtics and came back and won four

150
00:09:30,631 --> 00:09:32,430
out of five.
Oh God,

151
00:09:32,790 --> 00:09:36,120
am I see when the red sox lost to
the mets in 86 we won the first two.

152
00:09:37,140 --> 00:09:38,610
You realize that if you win the first two,

153
00:09:38,611 --> 00:09:43,020
the other team has to have to win four
out of the next five and all you gotta do

154
00:09:43,021 --> 00:09:46,380
is go two and three and you're
fucking blow it. Oh, it hurts.

155
00:09:48,090 --> 00:09:51,330
Um, hats off to the Vegas crowd.
I got to give it up. You know,

156
00:09:51,810 --> 00:09:56,370
the NHL chose so many wrong
cities throughout the years,

157
00:09:57,510 --> 00:10:01,860
you know, to try to get excitement
going. You know, Carolina,

158
00:10:01,861 --> 00:10:06,090
Phoenix, Atlanta, I mean, you know, Miami,

159
00:10:07,560 --> 00:10:10,860
it just, you know, and I just was,

160
00:10:10,861 --> 00:10:13,800
I was of that mindset of
what the fuck are they doing?

161
00:10:15,510 --> 00:10:18,150
You know, why don't you just
put one in mobile, Alabama?

162
00:10:18,180 --> 00:10:20,100
Nobody gives a fuck about this shit.

163
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:23,910
You're going down into basketball
and football, country stock,

164
00:10:23,911 --> 00:10:27,240
car racing and moon moon,
Shannon w you know,

165
00:10:28,890 --> 00:10:29,421
I mean they,

166
00:10:29,421 --> 00:10:34,230
they would rather stand
along the Appalachian trail
and cheer on a hiker than go

167
00:10:34,231 --> 00:10:37,800
to a fucking hockey game south of
the Mason Dixon line. That was my,

168
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:43,620
my belief. Oh my God, am I
fucking a, I'm quoting Bon Scott.

169
00:10:43,650 --> 00:10:48,470
That's mad
damaged gym.

170
00:10:49,290 --> 00:10:51,900
Um, but I, I stand corrected
because I got to tell you something.

171
00:10:52,500 --> 00:10:56,340
Fucking Nashville in Las Vegas,

172
00:10:57,420 --> 00:11:01,890
the level that the fans are going crazy
in the stands that they'd go in more

173
00:11:01,891 --> 00:11:04,500
nuts than a,
anybody in the original six.

174
00:11:05,130 --> 00:11:09,510
Granted we understand the game more so
we don't have to fucking scream and yell

175
00:11:09,511 --> 00:11:09,871
like that,

176
00:11:09,871 --> 00:11:14,190
but I think the Trifecta is going to be
Seattle as much as I trashed him earlier.

177
00:11:14,191 --> 00:11:15,810
Those are great fans in Seattle.

178
00:11:16,020 --> 00:11:19,410
They don't need any help to be
any louder than they already are.

179
00:11:19,890 --> 00:11:24,060
But I will always contest the volume of
that football stadium cause I went to a

180
00:11:24,061 --> 00:11:26,940
home game there and people just chatting
before the game and I was like this is

181
00:11:26,941 --> 00:11:31,230
really fucking loud. And people
just talking normally. Um,

182
00:11:32,820 --> 00:11:32,821
anyways,

183
00:11:32,821 --> 00:11:36,450
it was like that fucking Metallica album
where they made it like louder than 10.

184
00:11:37,110 --> 00:11:40,350
The one that looked like a coffin in
a pussy on the, on the, on the, uh,

185
00:11:40,380 --> 00:11:44,400
the album cover you had to like halfway
up and it was still blowing your

186
00:11:44,401 --> 00:11:48,460
eardrums out to the owner of
the Seahawks produced that one

187
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:57,620
better. Um, anyways,

188
00:11:58,910 --> 00:12:00,370
uh, I don't know. I'm
just think that that's,

189
00:12:00,460 --> 00:12:03,410
that's gonna be this
resurgent and resurgence

190
00:12:04,910 --> 00:12:08,930
after some missteps and some
of these cities by the NHL in.

191
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:10,593
Yeah.

192
00:12:11,030 --> 00:12:14,660
I don't think that it will ever
quite go mainstream though. You know,

193
00:12:14,690 --> 00:12:18,860
I actually watch game one at this cigar
bar. Oh, look who's here. The lovely Nia.

194
00:12:18,890 --> 00:12:20,120
What's that?
Who's that from

195
00:12:22,310 --> 00:12:25,520
when the one of the batteries for
her little, uh, toy gonna come.

196
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:31,270
Okay.

197
00:12:31,270 --> 00:12:32,820
Yeah,
they like watch batteries.

198
00:12:32,821 --> 00:12:37,821
She has this little creepy little purple
monkey that she absolutely loves and it

199
00:12:38,561 --> 00:12:41,500
just freaks me out. It's like this, it's
something you'd see in a horror movie,

200
00:12:41,501 --> 00:12:45,240
right, with that high pitch voice. Yeah.

201
00:12:46,970 --> 00:12:50,800
It's fucking head spinning around.
Stays on your finger.

202
00:12:52,090 --> 00:12:54,710
Can you, can you close the door, Nia,
so she doesn't hear all my filthy,

203
00:12:54,730 --> 00:12:59,530
filthy talking here. Oh, bring
her in. Bring her rent. Oh,

204
00:12:59,531 --> 00:13:00,790
it's the kid hour

205
00:13:03,730 --> 00:13:05,890
she's coming in.
Oh,

206
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:10,750
the itsy bitsy spider went up the water
spout of saying this thousand times

207
00:13:10,751 --> 00:13:15,751
today down came the rain
and washed the spider out.

208
00:13:15,910 --> 00:13:20,140
Hi. Can you say hi? Can you say hi?

209
00:13:22,360 --> 00:13:26,140
There you go. Can you
say, can you say Dada?

210
00:13:28,330 --> 00:13:31,990
Say Mama. Yes. Right.

211
00:13:32,230 --> 00:13:34,780
You know where your bread's buttered.
Can you say Mama?

212
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:39,520
There you go.
Can you say baby,

213
00:13:41,300 --> 00:13:44,170
you go.
Can you say thanks?

214
00:13:45,980 --> 00:13:47,590
Can you say please?

215
00:13:49,990 --> 00:13:54,790
You say dog. What else should she, she got

216
00:13:58,660 --> 00:14:02,140
nice.
Very,

217
00:14:04,950 --> 00:14:09,040
yeah,
that's right.

218
00:14:11,290 --> 00:14:16,000
My favorite thing, I love that. That I
get the mornings of mine, but with her.

219
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:21,790
Ah, that's right. I wake, I wake
you wake me up a change your diaper.

220
00:14:21,791 --> 00:14:25,240
If we give you your Baba, right. And
then I always make her breakfast.

221
00:14:26,710 --> 00:14:29,760
She eats her breakfast and after
every bite she has to go. Mm.

222
00:14:31,820 --> 00:14:35,740
Yeah.
Um,

223
00:14:37,420 --> 00:14:40,810
yeah. What did you think about what the
capital's didn't game to how they, uh,

224
00:14:40,870 --> 00:14:42,040
oh my God,

225
00:14:42,220 --> 00:14:47,110
that was a real showing tell you they
got out there and they played that game

226
00:14:47,111 --> 00:14:50,900
and I was like, whoa. He say whoa.

227
00:14:53,540 --> 00:14:57,260
Wow. Yeah. She likes it. The
bubbles, those little bubble things.

228
00:14:57,261 --> 00:14:58,880
She likes you blow the bubbles.

229
00:14:59,180 --> 00:15:03,110
She likes to run into them and break
them with their face and go and go,

230
00:15:03,111 --> 00:15:06,980
whoa. Being bubbles, right?

231
00:15:07,630 --> 00:15:11,570
Like bubbles.
Yeah.

232
00:15:11,610 --> 00:15:16,310
Actually getting shy. Um,
all right, so nia, can you,

233
00:15:16,340 --> 00:15:18,290
can you break down for the white audience?

234
00:15:18,291 --> 00:15:23,240
What's going on with Drake and Pusha t?
I actually listened to the song,

235
00:15:23,330 --> 00:15:27,950
I'm like, all right. So you know, he
knocked up a porn star, allegedly,

236
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:32,180
allegedly,
uh,

237
00:15:32,750 --> 00:15:37,070
this isn't going to end with a gun
battle, is it? No, that is not, no,

238
00:15:37,071 --> 00:15:40,470
that's not who those guys are. Those
days are over by the, Oh, it is. Okay.

239
00:15:42,500 --> 00:15:46,850
No more gangster. You, you shot me in
my live or you shot me. You shot me.

240
00:15:47,060 --> 00:15:51,500
Oh Jeez. Like I, that guy
drives me up the wall. No,

241
00:15:51,730 --> 00:15:53,450
push it.
See had such,

242
00:15:53,490 --> 00:15:57,890
I can't listen to Drake
that took shots at Drake,

243
00:15:58,670 --> 00:16:00,200
Drake shop back,

244
00:16:01,030 --> 00:16:05,690
Pusha t shot back and Pusha t shot back
in a way that was even more devastating

245
00:16:05,691 --> 00:16:10,070
than Drake's. Okay. Do you ever listen
to white music when that happens? Uh,

246
00:16:10,071 --> 00:16:14,060
white music when, what happens?
Uh, answer songs in a whatever,

247
00:16:14,360 --> 00:16:15,980
giving each other crap at whatever.

248
00:16:16,190 --> 00:16:20,240
Do you know what the original one was
as far as I know, the original one?

249
00:16:21,710 --> 00:16:25,730
Uh, well maybe it was the Flinstones
when they had bugged music.

250
00:16:25,850 --> 00:16:30,260
Bug Music. I can't stand
bug music. Yeah. Yeah.

251
00:16:30,440 --> 00:16:33,410
He said, yeah. Yeah. You remember
episode? Yeah, they will.

252
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:35,830
They would trash in the Beatles
and the Beatles never answered it.

253
00:16:35,840 --> 00:16:39,110
They were above. I'm
kidding. The, uh, the first,

254
00:16:39,111 --> 00:16:43,900
the first one was a Neil young made
a song called southern man. Okay.

255
00:16:44,700 --> 00:16:48,710
And Tom Petty trashing them?
No, no, no, no, no, no.

256
00:16:48,711 --> 00:16:52,970
Sweet Home Alabama. Okay.
Is An answer song. Okay.

257
00:16:53,270 --> 00:16:55,850
It's all in the thing.
I hope Neil young will remember.

258
00:16:55,880 --> 00:17:00,290
Southern man don't need him around.
Anyhow. Sweet home, Alabama, you know,

259
00:17:00,530 --> 00:17:03,140
and they, they never, they never
shout at each other or anything. Why?

260
00:17:03,180 --> 00:17:07,250
Why are you being an asshole?
Because you're like wow. Yeah. Wow.

261
00:17:07,700 --> 00:17:10,340
Oh Huh.

00:17:10,341 --> 00:17:14,450
that's why are you being in a hole?
I don't know what happened.

263
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:18,720
Neil young and who's saying all
right, I'm done with you. Okay.

264
00:17:19,980 --> 00:17:23,140
Leonard Skinner. Oh, lynching

to like waitstaff, people
going out to eat with you.

267
00:17:34,911 --> 00:17:36,080

listened to the song,

the pusher t songs so I could be
informed about what was going on and uh,

280
00:18:23,590 --> 00:18:28,510

happened, right? Because I was thinking,

287
00:18:58,071 --> 00:19:01,220
how the hell do you separate
your shoulder playing soccer?

288
00:19:01,221 --> 00:19:02,840
You're not allowed to use your hands.

289
00:19:04,250 --> 00:19:07,460
I would think like the one thing that
never happens is you don't have any

290
00:19:08,120 --> 00:19:12,770
fingers, hands, wrists, any of that type
of stuff. Injuries in soccer, right.

291
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:17,330
Although with all the diving, I'm sure
you know, if you dove a little too hard,

292
00:19:17,390 --> 00:19:21,920
maybe you could break your wrist. Why
do I trust soccer? I actually really,

293
00:19:22,190 --> 00:19:26,390
I'm really starting to enjoy it. I have
no idea why. You know, why I started off?

294
00:19:26,391 --> 00:19:31,160
I was in a crabby mood. I just tease
my wife about the fact that she, um,

295
00:19:32,390 --> 00:19:35,120
you know,
is less than cordial to waitstaff.

296
00:19:36,740 --> 00:19:39,710
You know what's funny is when she goes
into a restaurant, she becomes me,

297
00:19:40,370 --> 00:19:44,840
which is she has expectations of people
and when they're not met, she like,

298
00:19:44,841 --> 00:19:47,120
you know,
gets a fucking attitude.

299
00:19:47,780 --> 00:19:51,170
I'm not saying she starts throwing plates
or anything like that, but good Lord.

300
00:19:52,070 --> 00:19:54,680
Um, anyways, uh,

301
00:19:55,880 --> 00:19:58,670
let me read some of the advertising
here for this this week.

302
00:20:00,110 --> 00:20:04,740
This is an offer Thursday,
isn't it? Hey. Hi. Hi.

303
00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:08,780
Hi. Do you have any respect for the
fact that I'm doing a podcast right now?

304
00:20:09,170 --> 00:20:10,790
I know cause I have to ask you something.

305
00:20:12,170 --> 00:20:15,670
What are you going to be
leaving after your podcast?

306
00:20:16,410 --> 00:20:19,860
Take an Uber to my appointment that I
have sent to come back and take my car.

307
00:20:20,190 --> 00:20:21,350
Because your car is blocking my,

308
00:20:21,960 --> 00:20:25,480
okay. No, I can move it if
you want right now. Yeah, no,

309
00:20:25,490 --> 00:20:27,140
I don't want to be talking
about this on the podcast.

310
00:20:27,141 --> 00:20:31,490
This is not interesting to people
that our driveway is so small.

311
00:20:31,491 --> 00:20:33,320
I have to move my car so you can move.

312
00:20:35,150 --> 00:20:37,330
Okay. Well, um,

313
00:20:37,490 --> 00:20:39,680
oh, it is for reads. All right. I
got to read the advertising here.

314
00:20:39,950 --> 00:20:41,330
When do you need me to do that now?

315
00:20:42,010 --> 00:20:45,310
Or I could take an Uber and just, you
know, if you're going to later on,

316
00:20:45,370 --> 00:20:46,390
be able to take a car later.

317
00:20:46,630 --> 00:20:50,740
Okay. Do that. Do that then.
All right. I'm almost done
with the pockets. All right.

318
00:20:50,741 --> 00:20:55,330
Four sigmatic Nif Sigmadek,
that was a big Nas album, right?

319
00:20:56,620 --> 00:20:59,440
No,
sorry for Sig Sigmadek.

320
00:20:59,441 --> 00:21:04,030
Four sigmatic mushroom
coffee forcing. Oh my God,

321
00:21:04,090 --> 00:21:06,550
you can be tripping.
Four sigmatic comes from Finland,

322
00:21:06,820 --> 00:21:10,270
the same country that gave us Santa Claus,
angry birds,

323
00:21:10,540 --> 00:21:13,960
Tuukka Rask and mushroom coffee.

324
00:21:16,750 --> 00:21:21,040
Uh, also, uh, what's his face?
Uh, um, from Formula One,

325
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:26,800
the hell's his name. They're
not Nico Rosberg. The guys
who's driving their note,

326
00:21:27,150 --> 00:21:28,660
uh, felt Terry Botox. Right?

327
00:21:29,710 --> 00:21:33,040
Finnish people consume more coffee
per capita than any other country,

328
00:21:33,070 --> 00:21:36,820
almost three times more than Americans,
you know,

329
00:21:36,821 --> 00:21:39,070
and they don't seem to be out of
their minds when I've been over there.

330
00:21:39,071 --> 00:21:41,380
They seem like really level headed people.

331
00:21:41,480 --> 00:21:45,460
You think they'd be all wired and shit
during World War II when there was a

332
00:21:45,461 --> 00:21:46,570
shortage of coffee,

333
00:21:46,571 --> 00:21:50,890
the finish boiled mushrooms that
grow on trees to make coffee.

334
00:21:51,130 --> 00:21:55,780
Mushroom coffee has half the
caffeine of regular coffee,

335
00:21:55,781 --> 00:21:59,650
but it's twice as magical
al magical,

336
00:22:00,100 --> 00:22:02,230
easy on the gut,
less acidic,

337
00:22:02,260 --> 00:22:05,140
and you don't get the jittery
feeling you get from regular coffee.

338
00:22:05,320 --> 00:22:07,330
I'm already ready to drink this stuff.
I love mushrooms.

339
00:22:07,780 --> 00:22:12,550
The flavor is add your thoughts on
the flavor. Will I haven't drank it,

340
00:22:12,551 --> 00:22:17,551
so I'm going to say it's like hot
mushrooms and definitely not as shrew.

341
00:22:17,711 --> 00:22:21,460
Me As the mushroom you take on spring
break or a Coachella. All right,

342
00:22:21,461 --> 00:22:25,240
so you don't start tripping.
This product is ideal for adult children.

343
00:22:25,810 --> 00:22:30,700

hippies that smell good, uh,

Some of us have it,

359
00:23:26,230 --> 00:23:29,320
some don't,
but it's just because the census,

360
00:23:29,500 --> 00:23:33,070
but just because a sense of style seems
elusive for some doesn't mean it's

361
00:23:33,071 --> 00:23:36,760
impossible to attain. Oh my God,
this feels like every eighties movie.

430
00:28:03,011 --> 00:28:03,580
you'll get a,

431
00:28:03,580 --> 00:28:08,580
have you seen that patriotic fucking
beer that Budweiser is making?

432
00:28:08,620 --> 00:28:11,590
I mean, how much money can
you make off for like it's,

433
00:28:12,190 --> 00:28:17,170
and then they had like the name of a
veteran on the side of it, you know,

434
00:28:17,171 --> 00:28:19,990
it's like, dude, I was already
going to drink your beer. Okay,

435
00:28:20,050 --> 00:28:23,560
I already support the troops.
You know,

436
00:28:25,090 --> 00:28:27,790
I don't support what the fuck we're
doing over there in the Middle East.

437
00:28:27,791 --> 00:28:32,470
So I can tell you that a w which is far
as I can tell is slowly going bankrupt.

438
00:28:33,880 --> 00:28:36,730
You know, I'm all for getting
these bastards, but can we,

439
00:28:36,731 --> 00:28:40,540
can we get like a fucking more
cost effective way of doing it?

440
00:28:43,460 --> 00:28:44,700
Can't you just drone it up?

441
00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:48,750
Me undies is so sure you'll love your
first pair that if you're not happy,

442
00:28:48,751 --> 00:28:53,460
they do whatever they can to get you
into the right pair. And if they can't,

443
00:28:54,420 --> 00:28:58,170
they can't keep them in the return,
they'll refund you.

444
00:28:59,880 --> 00:29:01,500
So it's really a,
it's a risk free.

445
00:29:02,170 --> 00:29:04,390
Try the best underwear ever
derails what a cheap best.

446
00:29:04,450 --> 00:29:07,530
If you have to be to order this
underwear and be like, I didn't like him.

447
00:29:08,610 --> 00:29:10,500
And if you keep them
and get your money back,

448
00:29:10,501 --> 00:29:15,090

Yeah, I feel like the u s government
right now with the money, you know,

461
00:29:58,270 --> 00:30:00,550
considering there's no
end in sight to this war,

462
00:30:00,551 --> 00:30:03,100
there's really no exit
strategy or any of that shit.

463
00:30:03,101 --> 00:30:04,840
And how much money is fucking costing.

464
00:30:05,400 --> 00:30:09,160
They're kind of the ever see like one of
those talk shows where the husband's at

465
00:30:09,161 --> 00:30:13,240
work or something. And he finds out his
wife ran up all this credit card debt,

466
00:30:13,810 --> 00:30:17,950
you know, then of course it's a talk show
so they still side with the woman. Ah,

467
00:30:17,980 --> 00:30:22,980
you need to work longer to
pay off all of her yoga pants.

468
00:30:24,360 --> 00:30:26,490
It's my doctor felt.
Um,

469
00:30:27,330 --> 00:30:32,010
right now I'm copying and
pasting that wine advice, uh,

470
00:30:32,070 --> 00:30:36,990
wine town advice to my wife too,
my wife.

471
00:30:38,690 --> 00:30:41,680
Um, why did I give a shit about being
rude to the wait staff? You know, why?

472
00:30:41,860 --> 00:30:43,540
Cause she always trashes
me and my behavior.

473
00:30:44,050 --> 00:30:46,960
I'm going to use that in the future when
you start treating the people and in

474
00:30:46,961 --> 00:30:51,330
and out burger a little nicer.
Maybe I will work on my attempt,

475
00:30:51,350 --> 00:30:55,140
but you know what's so weird about FTE
FTE a flip out and then you calm down and

476
00:30:55,141 --> 00:30:57,660
then you just looking at your
broken headphones on the floor.

477
00:31:00,930 --> 00:31:05,070
It's just that sadness, you
know, why did I do that?

478
00:31:05,850 --> 00:31:10,680
Where's the other piece of plastic
that used to hold this thing in? Um,

479
00:31:10,740 --> 00:31:15,420
anyways, that's 31 minutes. I
wouldn't say it was inspired,

480
00:31:15,810 --> 00:31:18,810
wasn't inspiring podcasting
today. It was kind of, you know,

481
00:31:18,811 --> 00:31:22,020
I kind of fed off the energy of the
weather, which is a little bit fat.

482
00:31:23,820 --> 00:31:27,990
Um, I'm going to be running my hour
around La, wherever I can get up.

483
00:31:28,620 --> 00:31:31,830
I'll be doing 10 minutes spots, 20
minutes, boy, fuck, I can do it.

484
00:31:32,280 --> 00:31:37,140
Getting ready next week
for Dublin in London,

485
00:31:37,141 --> 00:31:40,710
England. Um, some people have asked me,

486
00:31:40,711 --> 00:31:44,430
why aren't you playing
more cities over there? Uh,

487
00:31:44,790 --> 00:31:49,260
it's because I'm going over there
for my birthday. That's why.

488
00:31:49,261 --> 00:31:52,800
And I'm doing two quick shows and um,

489
00:31:53,550 --> 00:31:57,990
and then I'm going to just,
you know, turn 50, I guess.

490
00:31:59,520 --> 00:32:00,750
I don't know what the fuck I'm doing,

491
00:32:01,050 --> 00:32:05,840
but I'm definitely going to
come back and um, I dunno,

492
00:32:05,880 --> 00:32:09,840
maybe a next year or something like that.
I want to go back and do a,

493
00:32:11,010 --> 00:32:14,040
a toy like I did the last time.
Um,

494
00:32:14,070 --> 00:32:17,910
except I don't know, I just,
you know, I got the kid now,

495
00:32:17,911 --> 00:32:20,460
so I don't know how long
I could go over there for.

496
00:32:21,090 --> 00:32:24,900
And there is just something weird leaving
the country with your wife and kid,

497
00:32:26,130 --> 00:32:29,850
you know, maybe I could bring
them along. Maybe I'll do that.

498
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:35,130
Maybe that's the fucking move. Maybe
I'll, I'll, I'll, I'll do it that way. Um,

499
00:32:35,320 --> 00:32:38,160
you know what, I'm getting off the phone
and I'm talking to my agent right now.

500
00:32:38,161 --> 00:32:41,660
How about look at that. It just that
out right in front of you guys. Uh,

501
00:32:41,690 --> 00:32:43,340
that's how much thought
I put into my career.

502
00:32:43,370 --> 00:32:46,400
I just talked to myself while
talking to you guys and there you go.

503
00:32:46,401 --> 00:32:49,250
Look at my broken headphones.
I'm sorry, headphones.

504
00:32:49,700 --> 00:32:52,040
Now I'm going to have to throw
you out because you know,

505
00:32:52,041 --> 00:32:54,530
they don't make that plastic piece there.

506
00:32:54,530 --> 00:32:56,870
It's going to end up in the
fucking ocean floating around.

507
00:32:56,871 --> 00:32:58,010
They didn't even have to be out there.

508
00:32:58,160 --> 00:33:02,270
I kept these things so long that they
like, like the shit was flaking off,

509
00:33:02,271 --> 00:33:04,940
you know, that goes up and over your
head and people would always be like,

510
00:33:05,060 --> 00:33:07,040
you got something on
your head. It's like, oh,

511
00:33:07,320 --> 00:33:11,210
just the spongy shit from my old
headphones. I'm sorry, old headphones.

512
00:33:12,680 --> 00:33:15,230
You know, this is like when
somebody kills their wife,

513
00:33:15,231 --> 00:33:18,800
like fucking 50 years into the marriage,
you know,

514
00:33:19,390 --> 00:33:22,250
the fit of rage.
I feel really bad right now.

515
00:33:22,550 --> 00:33:25,610
Are you comparing women to
inanimate objects? Uh, yes, I am.

516
00:33:28,170 --> 00:33:30,270
All right, that's the podcast.
I have a great weekend.

517
00:33:30,370 --> 00:33:33,890
You [inaudible] can somebody please
send me the video d if you've got a flip

518
00:33:33,891 --> 00:33:36,290
phone video of most solid and
his fucking shoulder yanked out.

519
00:33:36,650 --> 00:33:41,060
I just want to see if it's his filthiest
the pictures look all right. That's it.

520
00:33:42,420 --> 00:33:47,020
Have a wonderful
day.

521
00:34:02,330 --> 00:34:05,240
[inaudible] back
is

522
00:34:07,330 --> 00:34:08,163
turned from

523
00:34:11,980 --> 00:34:16,660
[inaudible] said that it
was from Gazans masters,

524
00:34:17,070 --> 00:34:17,903
so

525
00:34:27,350 --> 00:34:28,183
[inaudible]

526
00:34:29,580 --> 00:34:30,413
mmm,

527
00:34:31,280 --> 00:34:34,980
here's something that I, uh, I actually
read a quote from one of these magazines.

528
00:34:35,070 --> 00:34:39,000
I guess evidently a Clint
Eastwood was hyping that movie.

529
00:34:39,001 --> 00:34:43,560
Gran Gran Torino. I don't know
if you guys have seen that movie.

530
00:34:43,680 --> 00:34:46,860
I'm sure you've seen the ads for it.
Where he basically is,

531
00:34:46,861 --> 00:34:50,460
I get up late a lot and you
fucking person of another race

532
00:34:52,240 --> 00:34:57,210
and I'm a white man and I represented
my car represents back when America was

533
00:34:57,211 --> 00:35:00,930
good and the early seventies.
Um,

534
00:35:02,010 --> 00:35:06,600
I guess when he was, uh, doing the
interview for that movie, uh, he calls,

535
00:35:06,601 --> 00:35:09,180
I guess the current generation,
the pussy generation.

536
00:35:10,200 --> 00:35:13,410
And at first it made me laugh
and I'm thinking like, yeah,

537
00:35:13,710 --> 00:35:17,670
Clint Eastwood obviously has earned
the right to call people pussies.

538
00:35:18,450 --> 00:35:23,130
And I'm thinking, wait a
minute, [inaudible] is an actor.

539
00:35:25,680 --> 00:35:30,130
Okay, who plays tough guys who
never loses a fight really?

540
00:35:31,170 --> 00:35:34,260
And even if he does lose a fight
in a movie, it's a fake fight.

541
00:35:35,550 --> 00:35:39,240
So at the risk of making
second sack religious comment,

542
00:35:39,241 --> 00:35:42,810
first trash in the Great Mickey Mantle,
uh,

543
00:35:42,811 --> 00:35:46,170
now I'm going to go out to Clint Eastwood.
Unlike where his Clint Eastwood,

544
00:35:47,070 --> 00:35:48,960
I want, this is my question
for you guys this week.

545
00:35:48,961 --> 00:35:53,961
Where's Clint Eastwood got off like
where's he earned the right that he's this

546
00:35:55,321 --> 00:35:59,130
tough guy.
Cause like he plays a tough guy.

547
00:35:59,600 --> 00:36:03,060
I've known understand that
with like actors. Like I
remember like after nine, 11,

548
00:36:03,540 --> 00:36:04,373
like,
um,

549
00:36:04,440 --> 00:36:09,030
for some reason they wheeled out Tom Hanks
and like that was supposed to make me

550
00:36:09,031 --> 00:36:10,860
feel relaxed as an American.

551
00:36:11,160 --> 00:36:14,880
And I remember during that time I was
doing a joke on stage going and talking

552
00:36:14,881 --> 00:36:19,470
about Tom Hanks saying he's done so many
army movies. He thinks he's a veteran.

553
00:36:20,610 --> 00:36:22,380
You know what I mean?
It's not like you did army movies,

554
00:36:22,381 --> 00:36:26,040
but he played an astronaut.
He was in saving private Ryan.

555
00:36:27,240 --> 00:36:30,570
You know what I mean? And like all
of a sudden, like, he becomes like a,

556
00:36:30,840 --> 00:36:34,890
all these guys, like I said,
you know, here's, here's one
for you. I've got fucking,

557
00:36:34,950 --> 00:36:36,180
you know,
friends out here.

558
00:36:36,640 --> 00:36:40,350
Some were doing the touristy shit out
here in La and I take them down to Mann's

559
00:36:40,351 --> 00:36:43,620
Chinese theater or grooming's,
whatever the fuck they calling it now.

560
00:36:43,980 --> 00:36:48,150
And they got those, uh, they
got the hand prints in the feet,

561
00:36:48,151 --> 00:36:52,620
prints in the, uh, footprints
there in the, uh, the cement.

562
00:36:53,430 --> 00:36:56,610
And I found John Wayne.
I swear to God,

563
00:36:56,640 --> 00:36:59,760
John Wayne had the smallest
fucking feet I've ever seen him.

564
00:36:59,790 --> 00:37:03,930
I couldn't believe it. This is the
Duke John Wayne. This is the guy.

565
00:37:04,220 --> 00:37:07,230
Everyone was one.
Just thought if even breathed on you,

566
00:37:07,231 --> 00:37:11,280
he fucking knocky into next week.
This guy had like,

567
00:37:11,310 --> 00:37:15,620
I think he went to fucking lady gap to
buy his cowboy boots. He's six fucking

568
00:37:17,240 --> 00:37:18,930
the smallest fucking things.

569
00:37:20,490 --> 00:37:22,830
He could've fit both his
boots and his cowboy hat.

570
00:37:22,831 --> 00:37:24,290
That's how small is fucking Fida.

571
00:37:24,450 --> 00:37:27,870
If you ever go to La and you
go to Mann's Chinese theater,

572
00:37:28,020 --> 00:37:31,080
it's on the right hand side.
He had tiny little ass feet,

573
00:37:33,250 --> 00:37:37,940
you know, actors are fucking annoying,
you know what I mean? Sit there.

574
00:37:37,941 --> 00:37:41,490
And they put on fucking leather jackets
and they play these bad asses and it's

575
00:37:41,491 --> 00:37:46,440
just like, dude, you're fucking, you're
an actor. If you had any real fights,

576
00:37:46,470 --> 00:37:50,630
Clint, Huh? Somebody of
a fucking rear engine,

577
00:37:50,670 --> 00:37:55,580
the drive through at Burger King and he
got out and you settled the score maybe.

578
00:37:55,950 --> 00:37:59,630
Yes. I don't know what,
but you know, I dunno.

579
00:37:59,970 --> 00:38:04,500
I don't fucking let it just fucking
annoyed me. And moving on from that,

580
00:38:04,530 --> 00:38:08,310
somebody actually sent me an email
that kind of ties into this, right?

581
00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:11,640
I'm not saying Clin isn't a tough guy.
The guy's fucking ridiculous.

582
00:38:11,641 --> 00:38:15,120
He's 80 years old. He's still
lifting weights, you know,

583
00:38:15,360 --> 00:38:19,080
the way his eyes are squinted.
He definitely seems like
a bad ass. But you know,

584
00:38:19,260 --> 00:38:23,430
I want to see his fight card. I want
to see his arrest record. You know,

585
00:38:23,431 --> 00:38:27,390
maybe he was a juvenile delinquent
before he came up. I Dunno.

586
00:38:28,110 --> 00:38:29,610
I haven't Wikipedia'd him yet.

587
00:38:35,400 --> 00:38:36,233
So,
and

588
00:38:36,470 --> 00:38:37,303
change with

589
00:39:04,900 --> 00:39:05,733
[inaudible].

590
00:39:15,850 --> 00:39:16,720
Hey,
what's going on?

591
00:39:16,721 --> 00:39:20,500
It's built burger and it is the
Monday morning podcast for Monday,

592
00:39:21,280 --> 00:39:23,590
May 31st,
2010.

593
00:39:24,190 --> 00:39:28,660
How the hell are you happy Memorial Day.
Let's start. Let's, let's start with that.

594
00:39:29,650 --> 00:39:33,430
Let's show a little bit of respect.
Okay. What are you doing right now?

595
00:39:33,431 --> 00:39:36,490
Why don't you get off the
fucking Treadmill, Huh?

596
00:39:37,100 --> 00:39:40,700
Stand at attention and give
a salute to the troops.

597
00:39:41,810 --> 00:39:44,050
Seriously do. Quick shout
out. Big shout out half.

598
00:39:44,051 --> 00:39:46,830
What am I a hip hop Gj over here.
Big Guy,

599
00:39:46,840 --> 00:39:51,370
big hello from America to
everybody over there. And uh, Iraq,

600
00:39:52,360 --> 00:39:56,710
Afghanistan. Where else do we
have troops? Germany, right.

601
00:39:57,280 --> 00:40:00,400
Still got people over there just
in case they start acting up again.

602
00:40:00,880 --> 00:40:05,530
You know them. That's what you get.
Germany starting a couple of world wars,

603
00:40:06,250 --> 00:40:08,650
you know, I'm glad you did
it. I'm glad you did it.

604
00:40:08,651 --> 00:40:12,790
It gave us a nice rain at the top
after you lost for the second time.

605
00:40:12,790 --> 00:40:13,571
And then us in Russia.

606
00:40:13,571 --> 00:40:17,710
We carved it up and stared at each other
for fucking 40 years going, oh yeah,

607
00:40:17,770 --> 00:40:22,570
yeah. Oh yeah, yeah, yeah. And
then we just like, all right,

608
00:40:22,571 --> 00:40:27,300
fuck it. Yeah. And Russia just to
forget it. I think my mom's calling me,

609
00:40:27,301 --> 00:40:31,950
I got to go, but you know, fuck you.

610
00:40:31,951 --> 00:40:35,580
Anyway. All right. And then they walk
away and then we're standing there like,

611
00:40:35,670 --> 00:40:37,960
Holy Shit.
You mean this is all ours

612
00:40:39,720 --> 00:40:43,170
may technically it's not ours, but
there's nobody stopping us. Right.

613
00:40:44,680 --> 00:40:47,980
It's like Bo Jackson when he comes around
and all of a sudden he just sees 80

614
00:40:47,981 --> 00:40:52,460
yards a fucking green. You know
Kenny Easley ain't gonna catch you,

615
00:40:52,580 --> 00:40:56,090
even though he's got the fucking
right angle. It ain't happening.

616
00:40:57,380 --> 00:40:59,270
That's what our corporations did.
They were like,

617
00:40:59,271 --> 00:41:02,800
we're going to put a fucking best
buy and every God damn corner,

618
00:41:02,820 --> 00:41:04,340
this fucking planet.

619
00:41:04,341 --> 00:41:08,090
And we're starting in Iraq because as
far as I can tell on my map that looks

620
00:41:08,091 --> 00:41:12,540
about the middle. Everybody go with that,
Huh? Show her hands. All right then.

621
00:41:13,680 --> 00:41:17,400
Oh, right. Dead. Let's
fucking rally the troops.

622
00:41:21,780 --> 00:41:23,470
This is the best one out of all the socks.

623
00:41:23,800 --> 00:41:25,960
No disrespect to the
air force army and Navy

624
00:41:30,280 --> 00:41:33,100
Udo shores of Tripoli.

625
00:41:34,850 --> 00:41:38,650
I'm a stupid fucking ah man.
Red Cans.

626
00:41:38,651 --> 00:41:43,490
So I don't know where triple Lee is.
What the fuck is Tripoli?

627
00:41:43,910 --> 00:41:45,320
That's it.
A fucking awesome name.

628
00:41:45,950 --> 00:41:50,950
They really picked the right fucking city
town or country when they said triple.

629
00:41:51,410 --> 00:41:54,950
I know it's not a country. Go
Fuck Yourself. A European snobs.

630
00:41:54,951 --> 00:41:57,950
Listen to this shit who think
you're better, right? Cause you had,

631
00:41:57,951 --> 00:42:00,530
you know more about geography
and your jeans are tighter.

632
00:42:00,590 --> 00:42:04,460
You think you're impressing me?
You're not all right.

633
00:42:04,690 --> 00:42:07,490
A bunch of fuck ups.
Really. Amy Winehouse,

634
00:42:07,730 --> 00:42:11,060
that fucking Pete Doherty Douche
bag who's never done anything.

635
00:42:12,080 --> 00:42:16,460
His big claim to fame is he looks like
paste stumbling down the fucking street

636
00:42:16,760 --> 00:42:20,330
and you guys can't get enough of them
and you have the fucking balls to look at

637
00:42:20,331 --> 00:42:24,620
us like we're a bunch of fat fucks.
All right.

638
00:42:24,621 --> 00:42:27,170
Stand Down Europe.
This is our day.

639
00:42:32,660 --> 00:42:36,650
Ah Shit. So anyways, I was actually
supposed to go over to Japan, right?

640
00:42:37,300 --> 00:42:41,540
Little fuck he sucky. No, I wouldn't
do that. I would not do that. Um,

641
00:42:41,570 --> 00:42:44,060
I was going to go over there to go
entertain the troops and I don't know what

642
00:42:44,061 --> 00:42:48,710
the fuck's going on with that Gig. It's
supposed to be a nice three base. Bing,

643
00:42:48,711 --> 00:42:51,500
Bang, boom. Brian. I was gonna
come land in, in a chopper.

644
00:42:51,501 --> 00:42:55,130
I was going to do it up just like an
apocalypse now have a couple of chicks

645
00:42:55,131 --> 00:42:59,690
coming out. These boots are made for
walking right tassels on their titties.

646
00:42:59,990 --> 00:43:03,560
America throw some place
stations out into the crowd,

647
00:43:05,480 --> 00:43:09,800
play a drum solo with some fucking
chop sticks, you know, little America.

648
00:43:10,160 --> 00:43:12,020
That's what I was going to do.
And I don't know what happened.

649
00:43:12,021 --> 00:43:16,550
All of a sudden now it's like I'm playing
a rec room on a fucking Navy reserve

650
00:43:16,551 --> 00:43:18,980
base in Rhode Island.
I don't know what happened to the tour,

651
00:43:18,981 --> 00:43:22,430
but I was supposed to be going over there
and I was going to go over there and I

652
00:43:22,431 --> 00:43:25,820
was going to give it my all and I was
going to hang for next to, you know,

653
00:43:26,020 --> 00:43:29,330
four or five days eating Sushi,
hanging out in Tokyo. You know,

654
00:43:29,331 --> 00:43:32,780
just looking at a city like what if all
of New York looked like times square.

655
00:43:32,781 --> 00:43:37,230
I want to see it go to what? Go
to a Japanese garden. You not,

656
00:43:37,260 --> 00:43:40,670
you probably don't call it
a Japanese garden. When you
go over to Japan, you know,

657
00:43:40,880 --> 00:43:43,370
kind of like when you go to Philadelphia,
you don't go,

658
00:43:43,371 --> 00:43:47,660
can I get a Philly cheese steak? It's
like, dude, you're in Philly. Just say,

659
00:43:47,661 --> 00:43:51,020
can I get a cheese steak? All right,
everything is officially here.

660
00:43:51,440 --> 00:43:55,820
See that yogurt? That's Philly
yogurt. How come it says, Yo play?

661
00:43:55,910 --> 00:43:59,390
I don't give a fuck what it says.
All right,

662
00:44:00,500 --> 00:44:05,300
you're in Philly. So all
this food is ours. Um, yeah.

663
00:44:05,301 --> 00:44:07,100
So I guess you say, I want,
I want to go see a garden.

664
00:44:08,190 --> 00:44:11,960
So I go see a garden and
then be like Eisai Dai, Dai,
Dai. I don't speak English.

665
00:44:12,500 --> 00:44:14,900
And then I'd be an asshole American.
Like he don't speak English.

666
00:44:14,930 --> 00:44:18,620
Learn the fucking language.
You know?

667
00:44:21,400 --> 00:44:22,233
How fucking,

668
00:44:22,690 --> 00:44:26,750
how bad would that be if you just
walk down the streets of Tokyo?

669
00:44:26,960 --> 00:44:31,220
Just sort of yelling out to nobody in
general and just sort of over everybody's

670
00:44:31,470 --> 00:44:35,610
English.
All right.

671
00:44:35,611 --> 00:44:37,710
I think I've been ignorant
enough on this podcast.

672
00:44:37,711 --> 00:44:39,570
I right now you're probably wondering,

673
00:44:39,571 --> 00:44:44,571
you're probably wondering going bill
last week according to the MM podcast.com

when I Talk About Yo play yogurt
and you want to look at the carton.

679
00:45:05,640 --> 00:45:09,570
Oh yeah, that is what it
looks like. It's all up on the

681
00:45:17,370 --> 00:45:20,460
Uh, let's see. Like Archie bunker. Hey
made a little bit, a little video there.

682
00:45:20,461 --> 00:45:24,630
Edith eating bad. I made
a video for the uh, um,

683
00:45:25,080 --> 00:45:27,690
it's a long story. You'll see I've
got, we have an exclusive video.

684
00:45:27,691 --> 00:45:30,570
It's not even up on youtube
or maybe it is. I don't know.

685
00:45:31,110 --> 00:45:32,250
I don't handle that shit.

686
00:45:33,120 --> 00:45:36,030
I just see the red light and I just
start talking to people cause I'm a

687
00:45:36,031 --> 00:45:40,230
professional just like all those band
members on fucking Lawrence Welk. Okay.

688
00:45:40,231 --> 00:45:41,220
The light comes on.

689
00:45:41,400 --> 00:45:45,240
I start doing whatever it is that
I do to pay the fucking rent.

690
00:45:45,270 --> 00:45:46,710
I didn't know what I'm talking about,
but anyways,

691
00:45:46,711 --> 00:45:50,280
I told you guys that I was going
to be interviewing the, uh,

692
00:45:50,281 --> 00:45:53,310
the wonderfully talented
Nicholas Swartzman.

693
00:45:54,210 --> 00:45:57,060
Is it Schwartzen or Swardson or Swartzman?

694
00:45:57,150 --> 00:46:01,440
I think it's Swartzman with the Real
Nicholas Swartz. And please stand up.

695
00:46:02,160 --> 00:46:06,840
Um, Minnesota's own nick
Swardson grandma's boy.

696
00:46:08,190 --> 00:46:13,140
Don't mess with the Zohan Blades of glory.
All those fucking,

697
00:46:13,350 --> 00:46:18,350
all those movies that fucking every
college kid and immature 41 year old,

698
00:46:18,541 --> 00:46:23,160
soon to be 42 year old like
myself. Absolutely fucking
loves. I love those movies.

699
00:46:23,700 --> 00:46:26,160
Okay. First of all, I didn't
even know, I didn't even,

700
00:46:26,161 --> 00:46:30,480
somehow grandma's boy went under my radar.
I Dunno what I was doing,

701
00:46:31,080 --> 00:46:34,080
but I miss when that movie came out and
I started watching some clips on it.

702
00:46:34,260 --> 00:46:38,520
It's fucking, it's funny as hell. And I'm
going to rent it this week. So anyways,

703
00:46:38,521 --> 00:46:41,700
I was supposed to, um, and
that's what I was doing.

704
00:46:41,701 --> 00:46:45,690
I was ready for an inside the
actor's studio. You know, I was,

705
00:46:45,691 --> 00:46:48,750
I was looking at his body of work and
all that Shit, getting ready, you know,

706
00:46:48,751 --> 00:46:51,990
I wanted to have a good
interview. And then, uh, you know,

707
00:46:51,991 --> 00:46:54,750
when you have everything all
planned out and then just, you know,

708
00:46:54,751 --> 00:46:58,260
this is what happened. Okay.
I called Nicholas and uh,

709
00:46:59,310 --> 00:47:03,330
and I said, you know, are we good for
today? He goes, yeah, no problem. Uh,

710
00:47:03,690 --> 00:47:05,760
gimme and whatever. We were supposed
to meet in like an hour or something.

711
00:47:05,761 --> 00:47:08,550
So I'm sitting there and my fucking,
you know,

712
00:47:08,551 --> 00:47:12,540
my boxers play in my guitar,
right? Doing what I do.

713
00:47:12,541 --> 00:47:16,110
I'm trying to learn these fucking
surfing, all that Surf Guitar, you know,

714
00:47:16,111 --> 00:47:18,780
for those of you trying to learn guitar,
you know, try to learn to play by ear,

715
00:47:18,810 --> 00:47:20,010
so then you're not like,
you know,

716
00:47:20,011 --> 00:47:22,410
borderline retarded in an
instrumental kind of way,

717
00:47:22,830 --> 00:47:27,690
instrumental in an instrument kind of way.
So, uh, you know, there's simple songs,

718
00:47:28,440 --> 00:47:30,090
Barron Aaron, Aaron, Aaron, Aaron on down

719
00:47:30,100 --> 00:47:31,300
there now, now, now, now, now

720
00:47:31,920 --> 00:47:35,650
salt, one fucking string. You
can figure it out. You know,
you'll learn some courts.

721
00:47:35,660 --> 00:47:38,600
I'm fucking doing that shit
and I'm a girl goes up.

722
00:47:38,860 --> 00:47:41,520
Okay.
How I get to take the dog out.

723
00:47:42,760 --> 00:47:47,020
So she walks down the street and just
like in life when tragedy strikes,

724
00:47:47,021 --> 00:47:50,410
you have no idea it's
coming. All right. Yeah.

725
00:47:50,430 --> 00:47:54,640
I'm sitting there trying to learn how to
play. Waiting on a friend went, Eh, Eh,

726
00:47:55,950 --> 00:47:59,990
eh, boo Doo Doo Doo, Doo doot
boop beauty you, you know,

727
00:48:00,050 --> 00:48:04,520
and knowing my neighbors, having the
window open, not giving a fuck, right.

728
00:48:04,700 --> 00:48:09,620
Trying to slowly kill the old man who
lives down below me on a holiday weekend.

729
00:48:09,621 --> 00:48:12,800
I might add fucking three minutes goes by.

730
00:48:12,830 --> 00:48:17,600
My girl is taking the dog around
the block. What could happen, right?

731
00:48:19,070 --> 00:48:20,570
All of a sudden she comes in

732
00:48:21,360 --> 00:48:26,160
opposite dawn. She looks, look at me and
she's like, I just got bit by a dog food,

733
00:48:26,330 --> 00:48:26,820
cheese

734
00:48:26,820 --> 00:48:29,450
freaking out. And I was like, I
couldn't even fucking, I couldn't,

735
00:48:29,480 --> 00:48:31,280
I couldn't process it.
I was like,

736
00:48:31,281 --> 00:48:34,230
you just walked outside to go
take the dog for walking out.

737
00:48:34,520 --> 00:48:37,120
You're bleeding on your leg. What?
What's, what's going on? She had a little,

738
00:48:37,480 --> 00:48:39,320
was a nip.
Fortunately she didn't need stitches,

739
00:48:39,650 --> 00:48:41,930
but now my whole day is in shambles.
It's like,

740
00:48:41,931 --> 00:48:46,370
what the f what did you get bit by?
Was it a coyote? Was Was it? What was,

741
00:48:46,371 --> 00:48:50,250
it was a dog. It was a dog. Okay.
Who's dog was it? I don't know.

742
00:48:50,350 --> 00:48:53,930
They weren't around. It was some lady
there. She helped me out all his shit.

743
00:48:54,770 --> 00:48:55,610
The next thing you know,

744
00:48:55,730 --> 00:48:59,690
I go from sitting in my underwear trying
to learn some bill Haley and the comets.

745
00:48:59,691 --> 00:49:01,250
Next seen on walking up the street.

746
00:49:01,490 --> 00:49:05,300
I fucking don't even have socks on him
walking up on my stupid old sneakers with

747
00:49:05,301 --> 00:49:09,890
my feet squishing in my old new balance.
Right. Why am, why are you staring at me?

748
00:49:10,160 --> 00:49:12,290
Nia and I talking about,

749
00:49:12,291 --> 00:49:15,140
I'm telling you the story as to why
Nick Schwartzen isn't on this podcast.

750
00:49:15,141 --> 00:49:20,060
Come over here. Huh? What did I do?

751
00:49:20,061 --> 00:49:24,980
What? Come here. What did I say? What?
Why did you go? Oh, I got bit by a dog.

752
00:49:24,981 --> 00:49:28,250
Like I'm some sort of jerk or
Dork or something. No, I wasn't.

753
00:49:28,251 --> 00:49:29,660
I was trying to act like you crying.

754
00:49:30,610 --> 00:49:32,680
Hey, let's go. Whoo dog.

755
00:49:33,360 --> 00:49:34,570
That's,
I'm making fun of me.

756
00:49:35,200 --> 00:49:39,340
I'm not making fun of you fucking
told Nick a goddamn movie star.

757
00:49:39,341 --> 00:49:40,510
I couldn't do the podcast.

758
00:49:40,511 --> 00:49:43,630
I have to take my girl to get her
to get up a little booster shot.

759
00:49:45,700 --> 00:49:48,870
Well, I mean, what the fuck is wrong? You
don't realize I'm recording right now.

760
00:49:50,520 --> 00:49:55,230
I'm sorry. Yes, yes. Easy. Why don't you
go over on your laptop and go on Youtube?

761
00:49:55,320 --> 00:49:59,520
He's clearly in more movies than I've ever
been in, so I should probably shut up.

762
00:49:59,650 --> 00:50:01,080
Right?
This is ladies and gentlemen.

763
00:50:01,110 --> 00:50:03,890
If you ever wanted to look up back
pedaling and the dictionary. Oh,

764
00:50:03,900 --> 00:50:08,820
that's my tetanus arm. Oh, sorry. Sorry,

765
00:50:09,150 --> 00:50:13,020
I'm just explaining this. All right. I
thought you were mocking me. I wasn't.

766
00:50:13,021 --> 00:50:16,590
I was mocking the situation where you
just sit there and like nothing's going on

767
00:50:16,760 --> 00:50:20,280
and you know, you walked out to to fucking
take the dog out. What could happen?

768
00:50:20,640 --> 00:50:25,510
Remember I was sitting in my underwears
oh, he's on my leg. Ripped out.

769
00:50:25,870 --> 00:50:26,171
Well,
yeah,

770
00:50:26,171 --> 00:50:30,890
not that chomped on chomped on what you
did was you broke up a rape in progress.

771
00:50:31,340 --> 00:50:32,173
Yes,
that's right.

772
00:50:32,460 --> 00:50:35,550
That's right. This dog
was trying to, you know,

773
00:50:35,551 --> 00:50:37,670
take advantage of my
dog's necessarily rape.

774
00:50:38,010 --> 00:50:42,360
She tried to rape her and she
wasn't having it. And you know,

775
00:50:42,690 --> 00:50:46,710
dogs can't hold pepper spray because
they don't have index fingers. Thumbs.

776
00:50:46,711 --> 00:50:50,460
That's right. And so they bare teeth
and they go at it and a fight ensued.

777
00:50:50,520 --> 00:50:51,360
I was proud of her.

778
00:50:52,040 --> 00:50:55,070
She's not one of those dogs that just lets
other dogs come up and have their way.

779
00:50:55,071 --> 00:50:57,440
She's a fucking slut.
She's not a slut.

780
00:50:57,441 --> 00:51:02,150
She's a dominant female and she's not
taking it. Right. Well that's what I was,

781
00:51:02,210 --> 00:51:04,060
that was the story I was telling.
Okay,

782
00:51:04,100 --> 00:51:08,210
well will you draw a parallel to what
happened to me earlier in the day at the

783
00:51:08,570 --> 00:51:10,970
farmer's market when you get to,
I know it's not about me.

784
00:51:11,470 --> 00:51:14,770
Oh, and the creepy homeless guy hit on
you. Yeah. You hadn't yet an awful day.

785
00:51:14,860 --> 00:51:18,120
I told him, you know, I, you know, this
guy came up to me, I was at the front,

786
00:51:18,250 --> 00:51:21,660
I'm sorry, I'm gee, you're really just
taking this over. And he came up to,

787
00:51:21,720 --> 00:51:23,580
it was like, Yo, yeah I was, I was,

788
00:51:23,590 --> 00:51:28,270
I was buying bread from the
farmer's market and this
guy comes up to me and he's

789
00:51:28,271 --> 00:51:31,960
right in my ear, like all breathing on
my neck really close. And he's like, Yo,

790
00:51:31,961 --> 00:51:34,260
can I get some bread or a
water or something like,

791
00:51:36,870 --> 00:51:39,370
like it was,
it was so awful.

792
00:51:40,770 --> 00:51:44,680
What is that? Some new
street slang for pussy. Yo,

793
00:51:44,681 --> 00:51:46,180
let me get someone at bread,
sugar,

794
00:51:47,920 --> 00:51:50,170
1972 slang solid.

795
00:51:50,540 --> 00:51:52,640
It was terrible. And so I'm like, what?

796
00:51:52,641 --> 00:51:54,230
And he kind of mumbled
something and I'm like, alright,

797
00:51:54,320 --> 00:51:57,800
you need to step off and whatever. Then
he's trades getting close to me again.

798
00:51:57,801 --> 00:52:00,080
And I said,
if you don't get out of my face,

799
00:52:00,081 --> 00:52:02,810
I'm going to punch you in the
fucking face. I was so pissed.

800
00:52:03,030 --> 00:52:05,520
You say face twice,
cause that really kills your momentum.

801
00:52:05,970 --> 00:52:07,440
If you don't get out of my face,

802
00:52:07,590 --> 00:52:12,090
I'm going to punch you in your face
because you're in my face with your face.

803
00:52:12,450 --> 00:52:14,340
And I'm not having that with your face.

804
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:17,730
No, I think I said, if you
don't get away from me,

805
00:52:17,731 --> 00:52:19,560
I'm gonna Punch you in your fucking face.
That's what I said.

806
00:52:19,650 --> 00:52:22,800
If you don't get away from me,
I'm gonna Punch you in your fucking face.

807
00:52:23,070 --> 00:52:27,570
And he was a Ho Ho you're not that pretty.
You are not that pretty in any way.

808
00:52:29,450 --> 00:52:32,420
Hang on, hang on one second.
You just sounded like you
don't get out away from me.

809
00:52:32,600 --> 00:52:34,340
I'm gonna Punch you in the fucking face.

810
00:52:34,520 --> 00:52:36,260
Do you remember the
cop and reservoir dogs?

811
00:52:36,261 --> 00:52:39,980
One of the most underrated performances
ever in the bathroom with Tim Roth is in

812
00:52:39,981 --> 00:52:41,330
there. I said, buddy,

813
00:52:42,980 --> 00:52:45,590
I am going to shoot you in the fights.

814
00:52:46,310 --> 00:52:48,260
You don't put your fucking
hands in that dashboard,

815
00:52:48,470 --> 00:52:52,150
that classic cop speak buddy.

816
00:52:52,640 --> 00:52:56,540
That's what you just sounded like. All
right, so, so you almost got raped.

817
00:52:56,810 --> 00:53:00,810
The dog almost got raped.
Go Nice.

818
00:53:02,210 --> 00:53:07,110
Both bared our teeth and fought off.
You know these fucking advances.

819
00:53:07,111 --> 00:53:07,944
You know what I'm saying?

820
00:53:08,150 --> 00:53:10,830
All right. I'll write, go
write the script. It's going
to be a nice lifetime movie.

821
00:53:10,890 --> 00:53:15,660
Okay. You taking over the podcast,
they want to hear about me.

822
00:53:15,690 --> 00:53:17,550
Yeah,
that's what happened to Johnny Carson.

823
00:53:17,551 --> 00:53:20,610
All of a sudden you let a couple
people, guest host, next thing you know,

824
00:53:20,611 --> 00:53:25,280
you're playing golf.
Wondering what happened. Yeah.

825
00:53:25,320 --> 00:53:29,760
Beat it. All right. So
anyway, so that was the story.

826
00:53:30,630 --> 00:53:35,570
Somebody tried to, uh, adult let
some person left the gate open, uh,

827
00:53:35,620 --> 00:53:39,390
up to street. And, uh, this
dog came out with another dog.

828
00:53:39,960 --> 00:53:44,340
One was the lookout and the
other one fucking, you know,
came running up, you know,

829
00:53:44,341 --> 00:53:48,030
probably there's a little pink
dog. He, Dick and, you know,

830
00:53:48,031 --> 00:53:51,930
tried to mount my dog. You
know, I gotta tell you,

831
00:53:51,931 --> 00:53:56,490
I got to respect the dog up the street
for its belief in itself that it could

832
00:53:56,491 --> 00:54:01,390
rape a pit bull.
You know,

833
00:54:01,670 --> 00:54:06,410
you know, when they make those movies
about the fucking, you know, the, uh, the,

834
00:54:06,411 --> 00:54:10,400
the white guy from the suburbs who
wrongly convicted, you know, and he,

835
00:54:10,401 --> 00:54:15,000
and he goes, uh, he goes to prison. You
know, I just realized in those movies,

836
00:54:15,120 --> 00:54:18,210
when it's the black guy
who wrongly goes to prison,

837
00:54:18,360 --> 00:54:20,010
who's wrongly convicted
and goes to prison,

838
00:54:20,011 --> 00:54:24,390
there's never any issues about him getting
raped. You know it, he's a black guy.

839
00:54:24,391 --> 00:54:27,090
He'll fucking, you know, kick the shit
out of everybody in there, you know,

840
00:54:27,091 --> 00:54:31,260
and then dunk on the fucking warden
when they have the annual fucking warden

841
00:54:31,920 --> 00:54:35,430
prison fucking whatever game. Right?
But the white guy goes to jail.

842
00:54:35,431 --> 00:54:37,920
It's always worried about
getting raped. So anyways, if,

843
00:54:38,310 --> 00:54:42,870
because they've made that movie so many
goddamn times and you couldn't make it

844
00:54:42,871 --> 00:54:46,590
any better than Shawshank redemption.
But Tom Selleck made that movie.

845
00:54:47,340 --> 00:54:48,500
Somebody else made them.

846
00:54:48,510 --> 00:54:51,750
I came up with who the fuck else made
it and Tom Selleck went to jail and he

847
00:54:51,751 --> 00:54:52,620
fucking,
you know,

848
00:54:52,680 --> 00:54:56,250
he ended up running shit and he respected
his intelligence and all in all this

849
00:54:56,251 --> 00:54:58,680
fucking stupid white guys
shit that they do. Right?

850
00:54:59,160 --> 00:55:03,060
So I'm saying if you want
to write that movie, okay,

851
00:55:03,061 --> 00:55:04,770
if you want to bring that genre back,

852
00:55:04,890 --> 00:55:09,890
if you're sick of seeing to a boyfriend
and a girlfriend who are actually

853
00:55:10,321 --> 00:55:13,530
secretly hit men are spies.
Okay?

854
00:55:13,560 --> 00:55:17,040
If you're not tired of that genre yet.
When the fuck did that start, by the way,

855
00:55:17,490 --> 00:55:20,460
was it Mr and Mrs. Smith and
they've made like 52 of them.

856
00:55:20,461 --> 00:55:24,390
Ashton Kutcher has one coming out with
some other broad and they're standing

857
00:55:24,391 --> 00:55:28,260
back to back with guns in the, in the
titles written in like pink lipstick.

858
00:55:30,150 --> 00:55:32,380
Okay, I'm digressing here.
But anyways, this is how you,

859
00:55:32,430 --> 00:55:34,230
this is how you take that
one to the next level.

860
00:55:34,230 --> 00:55:36,720
This is a tip for all you
Hollywood screenwriters out there.

861
00:55:36,721 --> 00:55:40,080
This is how you fucking do it. You, uh,

862
00:55:40,200 --> 00:55:44,430
you have the white guy not only be
able to handle himself in the prison,

863
00:55:44,670 --> 00:55:46,650
but he rapes the toughest guy

864
00:55:50,550 --> 00:55:55,320
in the prison. Basically the pit bull
version of, of, of a fucking human being,

865
00:55:55,321 --> 00:55:59,190
whatever, the big, the big
fucking just jacked, you know.

866
00:55:59,790 --> 00:56:04,070
Do you ever see a dude just so big?
It's like you look at the, you know,

867
00:56:04,280 --> 00:56:07,800
had an aluminum baseball bat
anywhere on his body that I hit.

868
00:56:07,900 --> 00:56:10,980
He wouldn't even feel it,
you know, even as head.

869
00:56:11,010 --> 00:56:14,190
It would be like three times he'd be like
banging them on the head as he slowly

870
00:56:14,191 --> 00:56:18,270
turned around doing that. That
cheesy Bruce Bruce Willis. Look,

871
00:56:19,050 --> 00:56:22,200
you know Bruce Willis has one.

872
00:56:22,201 --> 00:56:26,050
Look when something's going to happen,
he makes his eyes a little wide.

873
00:56:26,260 --> 00:56:29,800
He makes his eyebrows tents. One of
them goes up a little high and then he,

874
00:56:29,980 --> 00:56:34,270
he makes his mouth like a little
round. Oh. And he turns around.

875
00:56:34,271 --> 00:56:36,340
That's what he does. That's what
he did all through pulp fiction.

876
00:56:36,341 --> 00:56:40,060
He did it and die hard. And uh,
why am I shitting on Bruce Willis?

877
00:56:40,061 --> 00:56:42,420
I like his movies.
What am I trying to tell?

878
00:56:42,440 --> 00:56:46,840
I'm trying to explain why a Nick
Swardson's not on the podcast right now.

879
00:56:46,841 --> 00:56:51,430
So yeah, I was playing guitar. Try
and learn some fucking, you know,

880
00:56:53,350 --> 00:56:56,080
whatever the fire, you know, the names
of the bands. I'm so new to the shit.

881
00:56:56,081 --> 00:56:59,600
Next thing I'm going up
the fucking street and uh,

882
00:56:59,770 --> 00:57:03,550
with Nia who still bleeding.
Okay. I did try to, you know,

883
00:57:03,790 --> 00:57:06,190
clean it up a little bit, but we
also have to figure out, you know,

884
00:57:06,250 --> 00:57:09,310
if she's slowly getting rabies.
So long story short,

885
00:57:09,311 --> 00:57:13,750
we get in the vicinity now we have to
start knocking on fucking doors to try to

886
00:57:13,751 --> 00:57:15,220
figure out,
uh,

887
00:57:15,910 --> 00:57:19,700
whose dog it was and I'm opening
the gates and the gates of creaking,

888
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:22,600
easy to walk into these
people's house we live on,

889
00:57:22,601 --> 00:57:24,790
like one of those streets are everybody's
house looks like the monsters,

890
00:57:24,791 --> 00:57:26,350
you know, so we, you know,

891
00:57:26,351 --> 00:57:30,370
to a much lesser degree rather than the
gates being like, you know, 10 feet high,

892
00:57:30,520 --> 00:57:33,820
they're like sort of waist, chest height
depending on your height, you know.

893
00:57:34,750 --> 00:57:38,260
So I'm walking in there worrying that
this rapist dog is going to attack me,

894
00:57:38,261 --> 00:57:43,120
so I have this fucking stick
that has a ball on the end of it.

895
00:57:43,121 --> 00:57:46,360
I look like a fucking wizard that
doesn't know how to walk with the cane.

896
00:57:46,450 --> 00:57:48,400
You know,
I got it upside down.

897
00:57:48,401 --> 00:57:53,401
I basically look like some blue collar
guy who was wronged and he's about to

898
00:57:53,411 --> 00:57:56,890
take the law in his own hands, but I'm
not going to get fucking bit right.

899
00:57:57,370 --> 00:58:01,690
I got a weapon Memorial Day,
weekend, hand to hand combat.

900
00:58:02,200 --> 00:58:05,710
I grabbed the shovel out of my pack,
so I'm walking up,

901
00:58:06,040 --> 00:58:09,940
I ring the doorbell and I hear Wu on
the other side. I'm like fucking great.

902
00:58:09,941 --> 00:58:13,720
Right. And then this, you know, and then
I'm waiting for the sound of the feet.

903
00:58:13,721 --> 00:58:17,200
Boom, boom, boom. Come walking up on the
hardwood floors. This lady upstairs door.

904
00:58:17,530 --> 00:58:22,220
Hi, I'm Mike. Yeah, your uh, your
girl. Your dog just attacked my,

905
00:58:22,270 --> 00:58:25,990
my girlfriend and then she
does just, you know, ah,

906
00:58:26,230 --> 00:58:28,360
oh my God.
I'm thorough

907
00:58:30,250 --> 00:58:31,900
thigh that fucking la shit.

908
00:58:32,530 --> 00:58:35,920
We get lazy by the end of the sentence
and you can't even finish the word.

909
00:58:36,580 --> 00:58:41,170
Oh my God. That's my favorite.
You're what? My favorite.

910
00:58:42,290 --> 00:58:47,170
Your your favorite? Favorite.
Favorite? Yeah. Rit.

911
00:58:48,180 --> 00:58:51,160
Not Raw as my favorite anyways,

912
00:58:52,120 --> 00:58:55,300
so she wasn't really like that. You
know what she was, it's the way fucking,

913
00:58:56,050 --> 00:58:57,670
I don't know,
I can't speak for other countries,

914
00:58:57,671 --> 00:59:00,820
but the way this country is right now
where everybody is just so fucking sue

915
00:59:00,821 --> 00:59:01,654
happy,

916
00:59:01,690 --> 00:59:06,690
she can't even express concern or
like a sorrow or apology apologetic,

917
00:59:11,531 --> 00:59:14,440
whatever that fucking word is in
whatever tents and supposed to use that.

918
00:59:15,370 --> 00:59:19,270
She can't express it because
she's worried about a

919
00:59:20,200 --> 00:59:24,210
fucking, you know, yeah.
Incriminating yourself.

920
00:59:24,600 --> 00:59:27,060
Like we're just going to sue
the shit out of her because of,

921
00:59:27,270 --> 00:59:30,550
cause my girlfriends got bit,
you know,

922
00:59:30,551 --> 00:59:32,920
and all I'm trying to do is
find out if it has rabies.

923
00:59:33,070 --> 00:59:36,520
And my girlfriend told me that the dog
was either black and white or brown and

924
00:59:36,521 --> 00:59:38,290
black turned out was brown
and black that she said,

925
00:59:38,291 --> 00:59:39,970
and I couldn't remember
what the fuck she said.

926
00:59:40,090 --> 00:59:43,570
And I knew that she had two dogs
and now I can't say to her the

927
00:59:45,090 --> 00:59:47,730
black and white one. And then
she'd be like, I don't have one.

928
00:59:47,731 --> 00:59:48,660
You have the wrong dog.

929
00:59:48,820 --> 00:59:52,200
[inaudible] you just fucking
a unintimidated me and
that she slams the fucking

930
00:59:52,201 --> 00:59:55,320
door. So anyway, so I had to figure
it out. They had fucking rabies.

931
00:59:56,250 --> 00:59:58,980
Long story short then you know, and then
I got to call Nick and say, ah, you know,

932
00:59:59,510 --> 01:00:01,520
remember how we were going
to do that three seconds ago.

933
01:00:01,700 --> 01:00:06,620
Well since then my dog almost got raped
and my girlfriend got a chunk of her leg

934
01:00:06,621 --> 01:00:11,260
taken out so she's got to go
get a tetanus shot. Whatever.

935
01:00:11,261 --> 01:00:15,460
Long story short was, I cleaned up the
fucking cut, you know, little peroxide,

936
01:00:15,461 --> 01:00:17,440
little bass Treyson I'd
fucking covered the shit up.

937
01:00:17,441 --> 01:00:19,630
And then it went back up the street
cause I realized I didn't even get their

938
01:00:19,631 --> 01:00:20,980
names and their phone numbers and crap.

939
01:00:20,981 --> 01:00:22,690
And I know that the doctors
are going to be like,

940
01:00:22,691 --> 01:00:24,330
well did you get proof that
it doesn't have rabies?

941
01:00:24,340 --> 01:00:26,470
So I had to do that and the
next time I went up the street,

942
01:00:26,471 --> 01:00:29,590
the husband was there and he was actually
cool as hell. He said, sorry about that.

943
01:00:30,230 --> 01:00:30,520
Uh,

944
01:00:30,520 --> 01:00:31,660
don't worry about it.
You know,

945
01:00:31,780 --> 01:00:35,230
I'll pay for the trip to the hospital and
that's all I wanted to hear. You know,

946
01:00:36,370 --> 01:00:40,480
not trying to get in a second Prius
out of a Goddamn nip on, on the inside,

947
01:00:40,481 --> 01:00:44,440
you know of a kneecap. I'm not
trying to do that but I understand.

948
01:00:44,441 --> 01:00:49,360
I understand why the fuck they did it.
But that's basically the reason why um,

949
01:00:50,610 --> 01:00:53,760
the reason why that uh, Nicholas isn't
on it. And this week I'm going to try,

950
01:00:53,761 --> 01:00:56,520
I'm going to actually try to hook up and
do a very special version. You might,

951
01:00:56,521 --> 01:00:57,181
you might get lucky.

952
01:00:57,181 --> 01:01:00,000
It's either going to be next Monday or
maybe sometime this week you might get

953
01:01:00,001 --> 01:01:03,360
lucky. Am I doing next to one? Uh,

954
01:01:03,420 --> 01:01:07,120
and if I am going to do an extra one, just
keep checking in with the uh, the Mlm,

955
01:01:07,140 --> 01:01:09,450
podcast.com the second I've,

956
01:01:09,460 --> 01:01:11,850
I figured out that we are
going to do what I will let,

957
01:01:12,450 --> 01:01:17,330
I will let you know the powers that
be know over on that page and uh,

958
01:01:17,331 --> 01:01:20,770
they will put it up and you'll
have the inside fucking scoops.

959
01:01:20,771 --> 01:01:23,480
So maybe you'll get something on
a Thursday or a Friday this week.

960
01:01:23,680 --> 01:01:24,513
Huh?

961
01:01:24,910 --> 01:01:27,610
How much you guys love in life?
It's a short work week.

962
01:01:28,880 --> 01:01:32,150
Well you gotta do is Olympia way
through fucking Tuesday through Friday.

963
01:01:32,151 --> 01:01:35,960
You might get an extra podcast
with sliding into June here.

964
01:01:37,310 --> 01:01:42,020
Good Times, good fucking ties. But
I was really looking forward to, uh,

965
01:01:42,380 --> 01:01:43,790
I was actually watching a ton.
If you get,

966
01:01:43,840 --> 01:01:45,960
if you guys for some reason
are familiar with nick, uh,

967
01:01:46,340 --> 01:01:49,610
Swarts and you really should just youtube
some of his stuff and then go out by

968
01:01:49,611 --> 01:01:51,830
all this comedy DVDs because like I said,

969
01:01:51,831 --> 01:01:55,670
I'm not putting anybody on this podcast
that I don't think is a, you know,

970
01:01:56,190 --> 01:01:57,710
is fucking hilarious.

971
01:01:57,770 --> 01:02:02,770
And I was seriously watching his stuff
just fucking die laughing by myself.

972
01:02:04,261 --> 01:02:07,620
Even like the quick little videos that
he makes, he's just, he's hilarious.

973
01:02:07,621 --> 01:02:11,010
And I'm renting a, that's your homework
assignment this week. Rent Grandma's boy.

974
01:02:11,520 --> 01:02:15,540
So you're up to speed and a or any
of the other ones that he's in,

975
01:02:15,541 --> 01:02:19,830
but grandma's boy, it seems
like he has the most lines
in it. And uh, I don't know.

976
01:02:19,831 --> 01:02:21,750
He's got a bunch of movies coming out.
God dammit.

977
01:02:21,810 --> 01:02:25,230
I had a fucking movie star coming on
despite what my girlfriend, thanks.

978
01:02:25,590 --> 01:02:30,090
And I was just me sitting here
under my goddamn ceiling fan again.

979
01:02:30,120 --> 01:02:35,040
So anyways. Yeah. So what
do you guys disappointed?

980
01:02:35,190 --> 01:02:38,670
It's just me again. I understand
that. Think I'm fucking thrilled.

981
01:02:39,630 --> 01:02:41,880
Thought I'd get a God damn
week off somebody else talk.

982
01:02:42,570 --> 01:02:46,800
Somebody else talk for a while,
do some shit jokes. Um, anyways,

983
01:02:48,110 --> 01:02:51,600
anyway. Oh, I got an email this week. Um,

984
01:02:51,850 --> 01:02:55,140
remember the old Douche bag of the week
award number that I haven't given one of

985
01:02:55,141 --> 01:02:58,260
those out in awhile.
Um,

986
01:02:59,130 --> 01:03:03,920
I got this really bizarre email from
somebody the other day. He said, uh,

987
01:03:06,420 --> 01:03:07,590
it said,
hey man,

988
01:03:07,620 --> 01:03:11,850
I sent you an email about a year ago
and it was something to the effect of,

989
01:03:11,851 --> 01:03:14,940
fuck you, you really turned
into a pussy, et cetera.

990
01:03:16,740 --> 01:03:20,820
I think though that I was wrong for
saying that I will continue listening to

991
01:03:20,821 --> 01:03:24,390
your podcast and look and looking forward
to any new shit you come out with.

992
01:03:25,980 --> 01:03:29,700
Um, I wasn't thrilled with your
California dog loving bullshit. I mean,

993
01:03:29,701 --> 01:03:34,140
we all love dogs, but we really
don't, don't all talk about it.

994
01:03:34,800 --> 01:03:37,080
You know,
this is like one of these guys.

995
01:03:37,081 --> 01:03:39,090
This is what fucking annoying
me about those emails. You know,

996
01:03:39,230 --> 01:03:42,450
those people where they realize they're
wrong and then they apologize to you and

997
01:03:42,451 --> 01:03:43,480
it starts off as,

998
01:03:43,490 --> 01:03:48,300
as an apology and then you quickly
realize that it's really just an excuse to

999
01:03:48,301 --> 01:03:52,980
start reiterating the shit that fucking
pissed you off to begin with. Hey, listen,

1000
01:03:52,981 --> 01:03:57,300
dude, uh, you know, can I talk to
you for a second? Yeah. Listen, man,

1001
01:03:57,301 --> 01:04:01,890
I got am I got, don't know.
I was in, I was in a bad mood
yesterday. I was, you know,

1002
01:04:01,891 --> 01:04:04,700
I've been dealing with flood of stuff,
a lot of personal stuff and I,

1003
01:04:04,701 --> 01:04:08,790
I just figured, you know, I just,
I just want to say sorry. You know,

1004
01:04:09,540 --> 01:04:14,070
I, uh, got a little out of
line yesterday and, um, I,

1005
01:04:14,120 --> 01:04:18,650
you know, it was totally my fault and
nothing to do with you, you know, uh,

1006
01:04:19,140 --> 01:04:22,620
just, you know, you're doing that faggy
shit that I can't stand, you know,

1007
01:04:22,621 --> 01:04:26,020
acting like it was like, wait
a minute. Whoa, Whoa, wait,
what? This is an appalling,

1008
01:04:26,030 --> 01:04:29,970
just stop right there to say
you fucking sorry. Don't, don't,

1009
01:04:29,971 --> 01:04:34,560
don't bring it around again
and start shitting on me.
So the guy's like, you know,

1010
01:04:34,561 --> 01:04:38,400
but fuck it. Everyone's entitled to
their own opinions, speech, et Cetera.

1011
01:04:38,401 --> 01:04:41,970
What the fuck ever. I will think it's
cool. You actually write people back now.

1012
01:04:41,971 --> 01:04:44,640
He's being nice to me again.
And you're also out there.

1013
01:04:44,641 --> 01:04:49,080
I actually like your material.
Thanks again. You know,

1014
01:04:49,320 --> 01:04:52,260
and you won't really annoyed me about
his fucking email is that he wrote I'm

1015
01:04:52,261 --> 01:04:56,430
back. That was the name of the title.
Like I'm actually like, I fucking

1016
01:04:58,620 --> 01:05:01,020
like, he's the only guy
who shits on me in emails.

1017
01:05:01,021 --> 01:05:03,450
Like I've been sitting around going,
gee, whatever happened to that guy.

1018
01:05:03,810 --> 01:05:05,670
I don't even remember when
this fucking happened. Why not?

1019
01:05:05,671 --> 01:05:09,600
Why couldn't you just fucking come back
and start a listening to the podcast?

1020
01:05:09,601 --> 01:05:12,090
I don't give a shit what you're doing.
I mean, he told me to go fuck myself.

1021
01:05:12,091 --> 01:05:14,910
A called me a pussy,
you know?

1022
01:05:16,620 --> 01:05:18,010
Do you know how many of those I get?

1023
01:05:20,390 --> 01:05:23,300
The only one I remember was with
somebody gave me shit for supporting.

1024
01:05:23,510 --> 01:05:26,480
So take two for taking
the side of a celebrity.

1025
01:05:27,550 --> 01:05:32,410
He was like supporting celebrities
and what the fuck did he said, uh,

1026
01:05:34,020 --> 01:05:35,730
fuck you.
Bye.

1027
01:05:36,970 --> 01:05:41,760
Like he was all done with me
and I just wrote back, alright,

1028
01:05:41,840 --> 01:05:42,680
take it easy.

1029
01:05:47,690 --> 01:05:49,350
And I just cracked it.

1030
01:05:49,370 --> 01:05:51,350
We up. The people are so like, you know,

1031
01:05:51,410 --> 01:05:55,070
I'm the supposed to be the guy that
thinks the world is wrapped around him,

1032
01:05:55,500 --> 01:05:56,340
not you.

1033
01:05:56,980 --> 01:05:57,813
Right?

1034
01:05:59,190 --> 01:06:02,340
I mean, these people make
me feel better about myself.

1035
01:06:03,200 --> 01:06:07,110
It's fucking guys think like, you know.
Yeah. Listen, I know you're still fucking,

1036
01:06:07,370 --> 01:06:09,810
uh, you know, emotionally distraught
about that time. I told you,

1037
01:06:09,811 --> 01:06:13,470
go fuck yourself in November of 2006.
I don't remember that.

1038
01:06:15,080 --> 01:06:15,913
All right.

1039
01:06:16,490 --> 01:06:18,290
Or if you're going to apologize,
just apologize.

1040
01:06:18,390 --> 01:06:21,860
Just sales guys kind of being a
cunt. Sorry about that. All right.

1041
01:06:23,350 --> 01:06:25,030
And then, and then just
fucking star. Listen again.

1042
01:06:25,031 --> 01:06:27,310
I don't eat Annalise and you listen
to your fucking explanations.

1043
01:06:27,970 --> 01:06:32,170
Douche bag of the week right
there. God bless you. Welcome
back, sir. Welcome back.

1044
01:06:32,171 --> 01:06:34,900
Okay. And you became part of the
podcast. Is that stroke your ego?

1045
01:06:36,550 --> 01:06:39,380
Hope you get run over by that fire
truck at the end of the parade. Today.

1046
01:06:40,160 --> 01:06:41,580
I never understood the fire truck.

1047
01:06:41,600 --> 01:06:44,270
Is that because it's always during
the day and they don't have money for

1048
01:06:44,271 --> 01:06:46,520
fireworks or you couldn't
really see the fireworks?

1049
01:06:47,900 --> 01:06:51,980
So in the end they got to have those
poor fucking firemen in their raincoats

1050
01:06:53,360 --> 01:06:55,310
sweating their asses off.
Huh?

1051
01:06:56,600 --> 01:07:01,600
Sweating off that fucking hooker funk
that half of them have on their body,

1052
01:07:02,301 --> 01:07:03,440
those heroes.

1053
01:07:05,680 --> 01:07:08,980
That's one thing I've learned about
firemen after talking to the cops.

1054
01:07:08,981 --> 01:07:13,190
Firemen love hookers.
They love him.

1055
01:07:14,090 --> 01:07:16,220
You know?
I'm telling you right now,

1056
01:07:16,221 --> 01:07:19,640
half the time you see a fucking
fire truck going down the street.

1057
01:07:19,641 --> 01:07:22,810
Half the time they go on and get hookers.
So what they're doing,

1058
01:07:22,811 --> 01:07:26,200
I think they have all those extra seats.
Why do you think they have that?

1059
01:07:26,201 --> 01:07:28,480
That debt fucking intense.
Look in their face.

1060
01:07:29,510 --> 01:07:32,960
The site, the site, they're going
to go get their dick sucked.

1061
01:07:33,920 --> 01:07:37,310
You know what was the last
time you even saw a fire?

1062
01:07:37,730 --> 01:07:41,210
Every fucking three seconds. You see a
fire truck going down the Damn Street.

1063
01:07:41,960 --> 01:07:46,550
There's no fire. They're getting hookers,
but everybody comes down on the cops.

1064
01:07:50,920 --> 01:07:51,060
Happy

1065
01:07:51,060 --> 01:07:54,060
Memorial Day, everybody. I'm winging
this one. I'm winging this one.

1066
01:07:54,061 --> 01:07:58,230
I thought I was going to ask somebody
else talk for the entire fucking time. Um,

1067
01:07:58,260 --> 01:08:01,350
you know, in my, my youtube
research, everybody,

1068
01:08:01,351 --> 01:08:02,820
when I was sitting there in my lab coat,

1069
01:08:02,821 --> 01:08:07,800
my safety goggles doing
youtube research, um, you know,

1070
01:08:07,801 --> 01:08:09,300
lately we've been talking about,
you know,

1071
01:08:09,301 --> 01:08:12,960
bad covers and people actually started
sending me some covers that were bad,

1072
01:08:12,961 --> 01:08:15,290
but they actually thought were good.
Like A,

1073
01:08:15,291 --> 01:08:18,380
there's some Ukrainian group
that does like this sort of a,

1074
01:08:18,381 --> 01:08:22,370
I don't know what it is, old school,
old school, like European folk,

1075
01:08:23,960 --> 01:08:28,160
um, version of highway to hell. So
just search Ukrainian highway to hell,

1076
01:08:29,090 --> 01:08:29,923
you know,

1077
01:08:30,980 --> 01:08:35,900
the Malcolm and Angus parts or run
an accordion and Phil Rudd's part is

1078
01:08:35,901 --> 01:08:39,110
basically an empty suitcase
and somebody hitting a,

1079
01:08:39,111 --> 01:08:43,400
an empty water bottle against it and
somehow it's actually pretty bad ass,

1080
01:08:44,180 --> 01:08:46,130
pretty bad ass. Those
guys, like they really,

1081
01:08:46,190 --> 01:08:48,180
they bring a great energy
to it and I gotta admit,

1082
01:08:48,230 --> 01:08:51,740
I kind of enjoyed it because you
would think it would be a train wreck.

1083
01:08:51,741 --> 01:08:56,390
So that's your first video to watch
Ukrainian highway to hell. And,

1084
01:08:57,350 --> 01:08:59,570
um, anyway, so I was kind
of looking up that uh,

1085
01:08:59,600 --> 01:09:01,570
that some of that surf
guitar stuff and uh,

1086
01:09:01,580 --> 01:09:05,480
they all use those fender strats and
I got one of those this year and I was

1087
01:09:05,550 --> 01:09:08,660
never really a fan. I always
like the Gibson sound with
the Marshall amp cause I,

1088
01:09:08,661 --> 01:09:11,930
you know Zeppelin Ac DC like
that's what I came up on.

1089
01:09:12,800 --> 01:09:16,190
You know Joe Perry always had
that 59 Les Paul, he used,

1090
01:09:16,191 --> 01:09:20,840
you know the deal and um,
I don't know.

1091
01:09:20,841 --> 01:09:23,630
I was into the beach boys for like two
seconds and then they just annoyed the

1092
01:09:23,631 --> 01:09:28,550
shit out of me. Um, but I don't know,
just trying to learn how to play guitar.

1093
01:09:28,550 --> 01:09:30,410
I grabbed, you know, he
listened to a little blues.

1094
01:09:31,100 --> 01:09:34,700
It's funny when you go back and listen
to those old blues guys like Lightening

1095
01:09:34,700 --> 01:09:35,331
Hopkins is can,
you know,

1096
01:09:35,331 --> 01:09:39,530
called lightening cause he was so fast
and compared to how fast guys are today,

1097
01:09:40,160 --> 01:09:41,510
he's not that fast.

1098
01:09:42,140 --> 01:09:45,920
So you kind of go back to those guys
because you can at least figure out the

1099
01:09:45,921 --> 01:09:46,754
rhythm.

1100
01:09:46,940 --> 01:09:49,340
I'm just explaining if anybody out there
is trying to learn how to play guitar,

1101
01:09:49,341 --> 01:09:51,050
I'm really trying to
learn how to play by ear.

1102
01:09:51,051 --> 01:09:55,430
So I'm not like one of those Douche bags
you see on youtube where somebody shows

1103
01:09:55,431 --> 01:09:59,960
you how to play the guitar, but in they
still want the tabs, you know what I mean?

1104
01:10:00,980 --> 01:10:04,520
Um, so anyways, so then I graduated to
two other Surf Guitar and like I said,

1105
01:10:04,600 --> 01:10:06,710
he's a lot of the thought of
the rips are all on one string.

1106
01:10:07,310 --> 01:10:10,940
But what I noticed in it
was a,

1107
01:10:10,941 --> 01:10:15,941
I came across this group called the
shadows and they got a song called Fbi and

1108
01:10:16,191 --> 01:10:20,510
you just have to see the
synchronized dancing,

1109
01:10:20,511 --> 01:10:25,010
the choreography that
they're doing. Um, you know,

1110
01:10:25,011 --> 01:10:27,200
you guys can keep sending
me the bad covers.

1111
01:10:27,201 --> 01:10:32,201
But a whole nother level of funny is
some of the bad choreography because

1112
01:10:32,571 --> 01:10:37,290
nowadays when you look at the
choreography that people do, it's like a,

1113
01:10:37,520 --> 01:10:40,220
I mean the, the, the dancers
nowadays are so good.

1114
01:10:40,221 --> 01:10:45,221
They'll have 20 people on stage and you're
watching them and they're all moving.

1115
01:10:46,310 --> 01:10:49,010
They're doing the exact same
move at the exact same time.

1116
01:10:49,970 --> 01:10:53,360
And back then in the 60s it was basically,

1117
01:10:53,361 --> 01:10:58,361
as long as you were doing
the same movement within
three seconds of the person

1118
01:10:58,521 --> 01:11:03,320
to either side of you, it was
considered a, it's considered,

1119
01:11:03,321 --> 01:11:07,790
I guess, decent. So check
out a search shadows,

1120
01:11:07,850 --> 01:11:12,470
FBI, this is some of the worst
choreography I've seen. And a,

1121
01:11:12,471 --> 01:11:14,370
if you want some heavy metal,

1122
01:11:14,730 --> 01:11:19,590
this is a whole nother genre and I
haven't even tip even even like tapped the

1123
01:11:19,591 --> 01:11:20,424
surface of this.

1124
01:11:20,580 --> 01:11:25,580
Look up Brittany Fox and Brittany's
B R I t n y Fox girls' school live.

1125
01:11:26,280 --> 01:11:31,280
And just watch the first 10 seconds of
their stupid and back and forth that I

1126
01:11:31,501 --> 01:11:36,450
thought was fucking cool as hell. I
literally saw it and was like, oh my God,

1127
01:11:36,451 --> 01:11:41,130
this is, this is, uh, I
was like, oh my God. No.

1128
01:11:41,131 --> 01:11:43,080
I was like, I literally said, Oh my God,

1129
01:11:43,081 --> 01:11:47,220
I know a fucking ditzy girls have ruined
saying, oh my God. But it used to exist,

1130
01:11:47,550 --> 01:11:47,940
you know,

1131
01:11:47,940 --> 01:11:52,940
like when you saw a Zeppelin fucking
burning back to the goddamn earth with

1132
01:11:53,071 --> 01:11:57,930
people on fire jumping out of it.
Oh, that was all the humanity. Um,

1133
01:11:57,960 --> 01:12:00,630
and then the last one isn't
even synchronized dancing.

1134
01:12:00,630 --> 01:12:04,380
But this is the main reason
why it took me so long.

1135
01:12:05,700 --> 01:12:09,690
And I never really got into Dave
Matthews was that stupid dance,

1136
01:12:10,200 --> 01:12:15,150
that White Guy, James Brown fucking
dance that Dave Matthews used to do.

1137
01:12:15,180 --> 01:12:19,830
Just search Dave Matthews dance and it's,

1138
01:12:19,980 --> 01:12:20,910
it's,
you know,

1139
01:12:21,270 --> 01:12:25,920
you really just want John Belushi to come
back from the dead and do that animal

1140
01:12:25,921 --> 01:12:29,280
house scene where he smashes the
guy's guitar except you really want,

1141
01:12:29,340 --> 01:12:31,800
I'm just hit Dave right
over his fucking head.

1142
01:12:32,100 --> 01:12:37,100
And the only reason why I ever got
in to listening to Dave Matthews was,

1143
01:12:38,160 --> 01:12:41,730
uh, their drummer. And
then I really liked,

1144
01:12:41,731 --> 01:12:45,840
there was a saxophone solo that I just
thought was the shit on one of their

1145
01:12:45,841 --> 01:12:50,640
earlier, uh, earlier ones. Other
than that, I just, I don't know,

1146
01:12:51,090 --> 01:12:54,060
I just haven't been into them. So you
know a few, you know now, right there.

1147
01:12:54,061 --> 01:12:57,900
That's a lot of work. That's a lot of
shit to go look up. What? You know what?

1148
01:12:58,110 --> 01:13:01,080
Why don't you take the
express checkout line? Okay.

1149
01:13:01,081 --> 01:13:04,710
The automated checkout line and just
go to the [inaudible] podcast.com we'll

1150
01:13:04,711 --> 01:13:07,530
have all those fucking videos
right up there. You can watch them.

1151
01:13:07,740 --> 01:13:12,210
We'll have them in order. The highway
to hell, right? The Dave Matthews,

1152
01:13:12,840 --> 01:13:15,720
I mean very little times in life.

1153
01:13:15,721 --> 01:13:18,810
Do what would I ever be
on the side of a bully,

1154
01:13:19,320 --> 01:13:21,810
but I swear to God if right
in the middle of his dance,

1155
01:13:22,200 --> 01:13:26,610
if the stereotypical high school
football player walked up to him with his

1156
01:13:26,611 --> 01:13:27,121
jersey,

1157
01:13:27,121 --> 01:13:31,650
still on with two of his other meathead
friends and they just stuffed them into

1158
01:13:31,680 --> 01:13:35,370
some locker that they brought
on stage and smashed his guitar,

1159
01:13:35,730 --> 01:13:38,880
you could hear me laughing from the back
of the fucking stadium that they were

1160
01:13:38,881 --> 01:13:43,620
playing. I would completely enjoy it and
I don't know what that says about me.

1161
01:13:44,280 --> 01:13:45,570
Oh,
we're 34 minutes in.

1162
01:13:45,570 --> 01:13:47,880
I want to give a shout out to
all the joggers on the treadmill.

1163
01:13:47,881 --> 01:13:52,380
You only got another word or
another fucking 13 minutes left.

1164
01:13:52,950 --> 01:13:55,650
13 minutes left.
All right.

1165
01:13:56,190 --> 01:13:59,640
How smelly is the person next to you?
You know,

1166
01:14:00,030 --> 01:14:01,950
are you on a treadmill right now?
You know what I love is those,

1167
01:14:01,951 --> 01:14:06,900
those fucking people who don't even need
to do cardio and yet they still get on

1168
01:14:06,901 --> 01:14:10,170
the machines and they always get on
like that. That old school stair master,

1169
01:14:10,790 --> 01:14:12,280
you know those people who just cheat?

1170
01:14:12,820 --> 01:14:15,600
They have like a magazine open in
their reading and then they'll look,

1171
01:14:15,760 --> 01:14:19,530
they'll like hunched over looking like
a question mark and that just sort of

1172
01:14:19,540 --> 01:14:23,390
moving their feet like flip, flip, flip,
flip, flip, flip, flip that. It's like,

1173
01:14:23,550 --> 01:14:27,790
what do, what are you doing? Are you
trying to burn fat off of your ankles?

1174
01:14:27,880 --> 01:14:30,880
Is that all you're doing? You're not
doing anything. You have full makeup on?

1175
01:14:31,150 --> 01:14:35,500
Maybe that's just La.
Do you know one time I was at the gym,

1176
01:14:36,610 --> 01:14:41,020
I'm actually going to go outside the
outside the bounds of a, this podcast.

1177
01:14:41,021 --> 01:14:45,130
I actually did. I'm going to, I'm
going to sort of name a name here.

1178
01:14:45,131 --> 01:14:49,540
I was on a, I was on the fucking
the elliptical, you know,

1179
01:14:49,840 --> 01:14:52,000
cause I want to have a hip
replacement when I'm 55.

1180
01:14:52,001 --> 01:14:55,840
I wanted to dual the fucking Earl Campbell
special. That's what the fuck I want.

1181
01:14:56,140 --> 01:14:59,950
Right? Actually like don't,
I don't universe. I don't.
Okay. I've learned that.

1182
01:14:59,990 --> 01:15:02,740
Be careful what you say
your word is your wand. Um,

1183
01:15:04,480 --> 01:15:08,230
so I'm at the fucking
gym. All right. And uh,

1184
01:15:08,950 --> 01:15:11,230
there's this girl in front of me,
this beautiful girl,

1185
01:15:11,231 --> 01:15:13,660
but she's got tattoos all over
a cell phone. I'm just going,

1186
01:15:13,661 --> 01:15:18,350
why the fuck did this gorgeous girl get
all those goddamn tattoos right there.

1187
01:15:18,370 --> 01:15:20,860
Fucking sweatpants.
They're hanging down.

1188
01:15:22,210 --> 01:15:25,960
They can see about a 16th of
an inch of fucking ass crack.

1189
01:15:26,050 --> 01:15:28,510
And I'm just going like that girl,
I swear to God,

1190
01:15:28,580 --> 01:15:32,560
if you just erased all those tattoos,
okay.

1191
01:15:32,561 --> 01:15:36,670
And you put her in a address
that that showed off,

1192
01:15:37,420 --> 01:15:41,530
you know, the beauty of a
woman, but it wasn't trashy.

1193
01:15:41,560 --> 01:15:46,030
Like this girl is like a
classy gorgeous woman. Right.

1194
01:15:47,170 --> 01:15:49,270
But she didn't know.
She said you met sweating,

1195
01:15:49,271 --> 01:15:53,020
fucking sweat pants hanging off her and
everything. And like four days later,

1196
01:15:53,021 --> 01:15:55,890
she's in the exact same one. I'm fucking
sitting there, I'm doing the elliptical.

1197
01:15:56,000 --> 01:15:59,650
There she is against sweat pants hanging
off and just so happened I was done

1198
01:15:59,651 --> 01:16:02,290
before and I'm walking by or
cause I gotta go, you know,

1199
01:16:02,291 --> 01:16:05,800
get the little fucking bottle of whatever
and spray down the machine I just used

1200
01:16:05,800 --> 01:16:10,090
, I looked at her and it was a, Oh,
this is such a Kathy Griffin moment.

1201
01:16:11,740 --> 01:16:14,940
I can't add Jesus. I, you
know, I can't tell. I can't
fucking name names that would,

1202
01:16:14,941 --> 01:16:18,190
that would ruin the podcast. All right,
I can't do that. I can't do that.

1203
01:16:20,380 --> 01:16:22,210
I'll fucking annoying is
that I couldn't do it.

1204
01:16:23,920 --> 01:16:27,460
Kathy Griffin has already ruined
the reputation of redheads.

1205
01:16:27,820 --> 01:16:29,920
No one's ever going to trust
us with this secret again.

1206
01:16:30,010 --> 01:16:33,820
She fucking hangs out with famous people,
right? And they're all going, oh wow.

1207
01:16:33,821 --> 01:16:35,800
Isn't this cool?
I'm hanging out with a fucking comedian.

1208
01:16:35,920 --> 01:16:37,920
And then she goes on TV
and rats out everything.

1209
01:16:37,930 --> 01:16:41,320
Then she picked her nose
and I was like, ah man, God,

1210
01:16:41,350 --> 01:16:44,890
Michael Landon just picked his
fucking nose. I know he's dead.

1211
01:16:47,740 --> 01:16:51,640
What the fuck? Right. So what am I going
to do? I'm going to do that on my podcast.

1212
01:16:53,680 --> 01:16:57,790
I can't do it. All right. I gave
you enough of a description.

1213
01:16:58,400 --> 01:17:01,570
There's a beautiful girl with way
too many tattoos. Figure it out,

1214
01:17:03,490 --> 01:17:03,821
you know.

1215
01:17:03,821 --> 01:17:07,180
Do you know any movie stars who are
beautiful with way too many tattoos?

1216
01:17:07,181 --> 01:17:10,490
You don't. All right, so now
out we're out of the movies.

1217
01:17:12,320 --> 01:17:16,550
It wasn't a musician to TV star.
Beautiful.

1218
01:17:16,551 --> 01:17:20,310
Too many tattoos. There
you go. You figure out

1219
01:17:21,830 --> 01:17:26,420
what, are you laughing at me or am I
totally given it away? Now I'm not,

1220
01:17:26,480 --> 01:17:27,560
I don't name names.

1221
01:17:33,290 --> 01:17:34,790
She just said you're ridiculous.

1222
01:17:35,450 --> 01:17:39,290
The amateur thrill I get because I have
no idea if I'm making people laugh.

1223
01:17:39,291 --> 01:17:42,290
If you actually left knee,
I know that I'm not wasting my time here.

1224
01:17:44,000 --> 01:17:48,500
Yeah, let's see that. I just
got an AH, um, all right.

1225
01:17:48,501 --> 01:17:52,370
What am I reading here? Uh, all right.

1226
01:17:52,490 --> 01:17:54,350
He did anybody notice last
week when you watch that,

1227
01:17:54,351 --> 01:17:56,360
that Sabbath fan going crazy?

1228
01:17:56,390 --> 01:17:59,690
How much he sounded like he
could do a dead on Sam Kinison.

1229
01:18:00,860 --> 01:18:02,540
I really thought that
that guy was awesome.

1230
01:18:02,541 --> 01:18:07,460
Somebody actually sent me in a fucking
hilarious email going like, come on bill,

1231
01:18:07,461 --> 01:18:10,710
you think that that because I said that
that guy is actually probably a parent

1232
01:18:10,850 --> 01:18:12,890
cause he's at that age.
And he was like, dude,

1233
01:18:12,940 --> 01:18:17,180
do you really think anybody's fucking
that guy? I mean look at him. And uh,

1234
01:18:17,870 --> 01:18:21,860
I would say this, if there was an even
amount of men and women on this planet,

1235
01:18:22,610 --> 01:18:25,820
I would say that he would be in trouble.
All right?

1236
01:18:25,850 --> 01:18:29,960
There would be a pussy shortage in his
life that would rival what the fuck we

1237
01:18:29,961 --> 01:18:34,010
went through in the early seventies with
the gas, with the, with the gas crunch.

1238
01:18:34,350 --> 01:18:38,780
All right. There was a long
fucking way to go. Um, but no,

1239
01:18:38,840 --> 01:18:41,450
fortunately there's three
women to every one guy.

1240
01:18:42,320 --> 01:18:44,480
So as a man,

1241
01:18:44,481 --> 01:18:48,200
if you're dating a loser chick or
someone who's just a total content,

1242
01:18:48,210 --> 01:18:51,950
you really have no excuse. But women, they
actually, they have an excuse, you know,

1243
01:18:53,150 --> 01:18:55,910
when they say a good man is hard
to find out that they're right.

1244
01:18:56,390 --> 01:19:01,160
I would think a man would be hard to find
if there's fucking, you know, you know,

1245
01:19:01,161 --> 01:19:06,110
three who has every fucking a hang
down there paying down over there,

1246
01:19:06,140 --> 01:19:09,470
you know? All right, let's read this
fucking question here on, you know what?

1247
01:19:09,471 --> 01:19:11,930
I don't want to do that. I don't want
to do, I don't want to do that just yet.

1248
01:19:12,770 --> 01:19:16,730
Beautiful woman,
not a movie star with a lot of tet,

1249
01:19:18,000 --> 01:19:22,880
not a musician. She also does not own
an ice cream store. Okay. That's it.

1250
01:19:22,881 --> 01:19:26,360
I'm done with it. I'm done
with the hints. Um, anyways,

1251
01:19:27,050 --> 01:19:31,730
and I'm not going to confirm or deny him
either, but I do know the answer, Huh?

1252
01:19:31,850 --> 01:19:32,990
He like,
I just went political.

1253
01:19:33,810 --> 01:19:37,100
It was one of the greatest quotes ever
heard some lawyer for some fucking guy or

1254
01:19:37,101 --> 01:19:40,570
worked in Congress or whatever the fuck
it was. Came walking out and they go,

1255
01:19:40,730 --> 01:19:43,970
they go, is it true that blah,
blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

1256
01:19:43,971 --> 01:19:45,560
And this guy just looked at the camera.
He goes,

1257
01:19:45,561 --> 01:19:50,390
I can neither confirm nor denied it.
I can either. I fucked it up. He goes,

1258
01:19:50,450 --> 01:19:55,010
I can neither confirm nor deny that,
but I do know the answer.

1259
01:19:55,220 --> 01:19:58,520
And he walked away. All right.
Put that one in your back pocket.

1260
01:19:58,520 --> 01:19:59,900
Next time you're in a fucking jam.

1261
01:19:59,901 --> 01:20:03,650
When the cops are asking you a question
when your girlfriend or lay your, oh,

1262
01:20:03,660 --> 01:20:07,800
you're cheating on me. You
know, give her Bruce Willis.

1263
01:20:07,801 --> 01:20:11,250
Look from die hard. Just look over
your shoulder and then just do that.

1264
01:20:11,251 --> 01:20:14,730
Alec Baldwin sort of whisper.
I can neither confirm nor deny that,

1265
01:20:15,570 --> 01:20:20,190
but I do know the answer. And then just
sort of look off right over a shoulder,

1266
01:20:20,430 --> 01:20:23,850
staring at something and don't break a
gaze and just walk right by the side of

1267
01:20:23,851 --> 01:20:28,170
her face. And I'll tell you, yeah, you
completely mind fucked you. You know,

1268
01:20:28,620 --> 01:20:31,320
you mind fucked her.
Okay.

1269
01:20:31,560 --> 01:20:35,340
And then run down to the corner and try
when the fucking fire trucks come down

1270
01:20:35,341 --> 01:20:39,240
the street, grab the side and jump on. Go
down the street. Get yourself a blow job.

1271
01:20:39,600 --> 01:20:42,120
Celebrate Memorial Day weekend.
All right,

1272
01:20:42,121 --> 01:20:44,400
let's get into the
questions for this week. Um,

1273
01:20:46,170 --> 01:20:50,910
I want to remind me to talk
about the 1958 Oldsmobile 88.

1274
01:20:51,180 --> 01:20:55,730
That's my new fucking car, you know, fuck
it. You know what? I'm gonna, I'm gonna,

1275
01:20:55,860 --> 01:20:59,970
I'm gonna put some pictures up there
and some of my favorite old cars and uh,

1276
01:21:01,170 --> 01:21:04,890
the Malibu,
the fucking Chevy impalas,

1277
01:21:04,891 --> 01:21:08,100
those early 60 Chevy impalas,
the Lincoln continental error,

1278
01:21:08,790 --> 01:21:13,650
JFK getting his brains blown out.
That fucking Eric car. The uh,

1279
01:21:14,330 --> 01:21:18,360
I have never been a big Oldsmobile guy.
Even like the muscle cars.

1280
01:21:18,361 --> 01:21:21,930
For me it was either the Mustang and
there was certain years of the, uh,

1281
01:21:22,500 --> 01:21:25,470
certain years of the um,
the Camaro that I really liked.

1282
01:21:26,100 --> 01:21:28,260
Like as much as I liked
the late sixties one,

1283
01:21:28,261 --> 01:21:33,261
I think that 19 seventy's Camaro where
they get like death fucking sharp nose on

1284
01:21:33,271 --> 01:21:35,250
it is the meanest looking God damn car.

1285
01:21:35,251 --> 01:21:39,000
And it's got the corvette
round brake lights, the cars,

1286
01:21:39,050 --> 01:21:41,550
the shit and always seem like whenever,
I don't know,

1287
01:21:41,700 --> 01:21:42,570
cause it was a little bigger.

1288
01:21:42,570 --> 01:21:45,480
It always just seemed like the gear heads
always figure out how to put like some

1289
01:21:45,481 --> 01:21:50,430
fucking 700 cubic fucking whatever
the fuck. I don't know about engines.

1290
01:21:50,910 --> 01:21:54,900
They put a Goddamn jet engine in the
thing. Oh, and here's another thing too.

1291
01:21:56,310 --> 01:21:57,240
Jay Leno,

1292
01:21:58,920 --> 01:22:02,820
I'm fucking obsessed with
his car collection and I'm
always going on his website.

1293
01:22:03,090 --> 01:22:04,650
Jay Leno's garage or whatever.

1294
01:22:04,651 --> 01:22:08,160
We'll have the link on the
[inaudible] podcast.com. Um,

1295
01:22:09,660 --> 01:22:14,070
he has a fucking look up Jay Leno.
Here's another youtube video.

1296
01:22:14,071 --> 01:22:18,420
Look up Jay Leno tank car,
this fucking maniac.

1297
01:22:18,450 --> 01:22:22,350
But uh, uh, an engine,
he took it out of a tank,

1298
01:22:22,910 --> 01:22:26,250
never get dentally Chrysler
Dodge made it cause it's a Hemi,

1299
01:22:26,251 --> 01:22:30,870
but it's like a fucking 58 cylinder and
he made a hot rod out of it and open

1300
01:22:30,871 --> 01:22:34,830
wheel hot rod. The fucking car is like,
I swear to God, it's like 25 feet long.

1301
01:22:35,700 --> 01:22:39,750
It's longer than the 58 continental
right near one of the longest production

1302
01:22:39,751 --> 01:22:44,400
cars of all time. I was actually
talking to my dad about all cars.

1303
01:22:44,401 --> 01:22:46,920
He knows all about old cars.
You know,

1304
01:22:47,020 --> 01:22:50,830
he used to do that when we were kids all
the time. Be driving down the street.

1305
01:22:50,860 --> 01:22:52,470
We see a car [inaudible] car.
I'd be like,

1306
01:22:52,471 --> 01:22:56,550
dad is a 1955 Buick special

1307
01:22:58,050 --> 01:23:01,110
at a three 50 God, that was a beautiful
car. That's all we always ended with guy.

1308
01:23:01,111 --> 01:23:03,000
That was a beautiful car actually,

1309
01:23:03,140 --> 01:23:07,510
when one time watching one of those Dudley
movies where he plays a drunk and you

1310
01:23:07,511 --> 01:23:07,601
know,

1311
01:23:07,601 --> 01:23:11,800
he drives his Rolls Royce and he comes
screeching in hammered and he rear ends

1312
01:23:11,801 --> 01:23:15,160
another car.
And my dad loves cars so much.

1313
01:23:15,310 --> 01:23:17,110
He's literally watching it and as,

1314
01:23:17,111 --> 01:23:20,950
as the dude is coming in in that
screeching in the car and it's so clear,

1315
01:23:20,951 --> 01:23:25,090
he's going to hit a fire hydrant or
whatever with that, that $5,000 grill,

1316
01:23:25,360 --> 01:23:30,070
remember that 16 candles? You got five
grand and I've got five grand, right?

1317
01:23:30,370 --> 01:23:33,280
He comes flying.
My Dad is literally going,

1318
01:23:34,540 --> 01:23:36,850
making that noise, you know, liquid.

1319
01:23:36,851 --> 01:23:40,680
Something precious is going to break
and it fuck he rear ends the car.

1320
01:23:40,700 --> 01:23:44,170
Then my dad's like, well,
why did they have to do that?

1321
01:23:46,130 --> 01:23:48,460
I'm just sitting there laughing.
Go ahead dad.

1322
01:23:48,461 --> 01:23:53,290
It's probably a fake Royal Rolls Royce,
you know? And he goes, yes, but I know,

1323
01:23:53,291 --> 01:23:57,940
but whatever the fuck that means.
My Dad's hilarious and he and I and I,

1324
01:23:58,000 --> 01:24:02,560
whatever is in his DNA about
loving cars from the 50s,

1325
01:24:02,950 --> 01:24:07,390
forties and, and uh, the 60s I got that.

1326
01:24:07,450 --> 01:24:09,910
I don't know what happened. I tapped
into that shit. But like I said,

1327
01:24:10,010 --> 01:24:11,350
I'd never been an Oldsmobile guy,

1328
01:24:11,710 --> 01:24:16,710
but there is a fucking 1958 Oldsmobile
88 that this guy really did.

1329
01:24:17,590 --> 01:24:22,410
That is um,
it's gold and uh,

1330
01:24:22,450 --> 01:24:26,350
just if those front four headlights, it's
amazing because the Chevy's went from,

1331
01:24:26,770 --> 01:24:30,940
from two headlights to, for between
57 and 58. And I always hated that.

1332
01:24:30,941 --> 01:24:34,840
I hated how the Bel Air looked cause it
just ended up looking like a checker cab.

1333
01:24:35,020 --> 01:24:38,970
I like the 55 to 57 Bel air when
it had the single head light.

1334
01:24:39,070 --> 01:24:43,510
We want to just the classic, you know,
from Memorial Day American car designs,

1335
01:24:43,511 --> 01:24:46,480
how the fuck we went to that. And
I was actually thinking, you know,

1336
01:24:46,600 --> 01:24:48,850
I have a kid here,
you know,

1337
01:24:49,810 --> 01:24:51,850
am I really going to drive
down the street going,

1338
01:24:51,851 --> 01:24:55,720
that's a fucking 1987 Chevy Lumina.

1339
01:24:56,590 --> 01:24:59,410
God, that was a beautiful car. I'm not
even gonna know what the fuck it was.

1340
01:25:00,910 --> 01:25:04,690
Ford Astro. I'm not going to know
what it was. They all look the same,

1341
01:25:04,691 --> 01:25:07,540
but back then they had like,
it was a man like,

1342
01:25:07,541 --> 01:25:09,490
you know what I liked
about the cars back then,

1343
01:25:09,540 --> 01:25:13,990
and I might be wrong here because this
is a, you know, like I said, I'm not,

1344
01:25:13,991 --> 01:25:17,530
I'm not a fucking mechanic
obviously and shit,

1345
01:25:17,531 --> 01:25:22,150
but like back then the way they had
things broken down was, you know,

1346
01:25:22,151 --> 01:25:23,890
nowadays like,
um,

1347
01:25:25,290 --> 01:25:29,740
I like how can I put
this like it like Toyota,

1348
01:25:29,980 --> 01:25:34,420
we'll make everything from
uh, from a, uh, like a Prius,

1349
01:25:34,421 --> 01:25:35,650
low end car.
Like what?

1350
01:25:35,651 --> 01:25:40,651
I drive all the way up to a high
end car that'll still say Toyota.

1351
01:25:41,291 --> 01:25:45,490
I know they have Lexus and all that, but
Toyota we'll make like a, like a 50,000,

1352
01:25:46,410 --> 01:25:50,030
$60,000 car and they'll make like
an 18,000, $20,000 current and all.

1353
01:25:50,180 --> 01:25:51,730
It's all under the brand name.
Toyota,

1354
01:25:52,150 --> 01:25:55,850
we're back in the day as far as
my understanding of it was Canada.

1355
01:25:55,900 --> 01:26:00,550
They went Cadillac, Buick,
Oldsmobile, Plymouth,

1356
01:26:00,640 --> 01:26:05,270
Chevrolet,
and Chevy's were like bottom and cars,

1357
01:26:06,110 --> 01:26:10,820
you know, and then if you drove up, it's,
it was like the status was like, what? Uh,

1358
01:26:11,000 --> 01:26:12,830
what make you a drive?
And I believe,

1359
01:26:13,470 --> 01:26:16,010
at least that's the way I kind of
understand if you drove a Chevy,

1360
01:26:16,360 --> 01:26:19,730
you kind of a young guy, you know, um,

1361
01:26:19,731 --> 01:26:23,330
making your way up the ladder and you go
back to your high school reunion and be

1362
01:26:23,331 --> 01:26:26,060
like, what? What's he
driving? Striving a Plymouth,

1363
01:26:26,061 --> 01:26:30,140
a fucking shitty was driving a
Chevy in high school. The fuck,

1364
01:26:30,470 --> 01:26:33,830
how old is he? You know, but if
you, if you got up to, you know,

1365
01:26:34,100 --> 01:26:37,130
Buick and Oldsmobile, you're doing are
right, but if you're driving a Cadillac,

1366
01:26:37,131 --> 01:26:38,570
you will fucking run and shit.

1367
01:26:38,930 --> 01:26:42,920
And I think that work the same way with
like Chrysler where when Chrysler, the

1368
01:26:44,420 --> 01:26:47,690
Sodo Plymouth and then dodge, I don't
know, I just remember when I was in,

1369
01:26:47,691 --> 01:26:51,650
when I was sitting and was in a bar in
Colorado and they had this old school

1370
01:26:51,651 --> 01:26:56,450
poster that said, buy your
wife a Chevy, which is funny.

1371
01:26:56,451 --> 01:26:59,180
It's like, Hey, buy one of those low
end cars that'll shut her the fuck up.

1372
01:26:59,820 --> 01:27:00,820
Probably doesn't even mean that.

1373
01:27:00,950 --> 01:27:05,050
It's just how my chauvinist
stick mine took dead. Anyways,
let's, let's, uh, well,

1374
01:27:05,360 --> 01:27:08,450
well, we'll have a picture
of like, I'll say like, uh,

1375
01:27:08,780 --> 01:27:13,780
like three or four of my most favorite
American cars in celebration of a

1376
01:27:15,080 --> 01:27:19,910
memorial day weekend and all the troops,
you know, uh, you know what I mean?

1377
01:27:19,940 --> 01:27:22,010
I can barely handle being in Arizona.

1378
01:27:22,011 --> 01:27:25,250
I don't know how the fuck I
would ever survive. You know,

1379
01:27:25,310 --> 01:27:26,420
if I was ever going to go to war,

1380
01:27:26,421 --> 01:27:29,300
I should have gone to war back in
the day when we were, uh, well,

1381
01:27:29,330 --> 01:27:32,900
I guess we used to fight in the tropics.
Jesus Christ. That would have been,

1382
01:27:32,950 --> 01:27:35,750
you know, I probably could do they
let red heads into the fucking army.

1383
01:27:35,780 --> 01:27:39,880
You probably, that's is it,

1384
01:27:39,890 --> 01:27:43,940
can I get a deferment for having no
pigment? I've never seen an albino marine,

1385
01:27:43,941 --> 01:27:46,910
you know what I mean? Can I get,
that's like having flat feet.

1386
01:27:48,820 --> 01:27:51,770
I've got a bad back. I'm a red head.
What? W what are you going to stick me?

1387
01:27:52,480 --> 01:27:55,820
All right. You want to fucking have
hand to hand combat and Greenland?

1388
01:27:56,030 --> 01:28:00,260
I'm there baby. I'm fucking right
there. I'll have a knife from my teeth.

1389
01:28:00,261 --> 01:28:03,740
I'll take out a polar bear.
I swear to God I won't cower.

1390
01:28:04,180 --> 01:28:08,630
And my little fucking Igloo crying is
someone else's going private Burke.

1391
01:28:08,690 --> 01:28:13,130
Get your shit together.
I don't want to go out there.

1392
01:28:13,350 --> 01:28:17,780
It's scary
me.

1393
01:28:17,781 --> 01:28:19,400
I am killing with you this week.

1394
01:28:21,890 --> 01:28:25,400
I'm fucking funny today. See how
women, they always got to clarify it.

1395
01:28:25,460 --> 01:28:28,960
Why can't you just say your fucking
funny? I'm funny today. You know what?

1396
01:28:29,000 --> 01:28:30,370
That's what God made you.
So beautiful.

1397
01:28:30,410 --> 01:28:32,300
You'd come in here with your
hair looking all glamorous.

1398
01:28:32,540 --> 01:28:33,550
I was really mad at you twice.

1399
01:28:33,551 --> 01:28:37,480
I saw you come walking in here like
some old school movie star. See that?

1400
01:28:37,520 --> 01:28:38,270
See how I do that?

1401
01:28:38,270 --> 01:28:41,660
I insult him and then I quickly
compliment him and then I get the yard.

1402
01:28:41,960 --> 01:28:45,200
What do you have in your hand?
I am.

1403
01:28:45,920 --> 01:28:50,420
That's why you like me and women
like the assholes they do, right?

1404
01:28:51,130 --> 01:28:52,970
Cause you know we know how to fuck.
Wow.

1405
01:28:57,740 --> 01:29:01,680
Anyways. Oh, whatever. I'm shit talking.
It's a holiday. Somebody rubbing my balls.

1406
01:29:01,681 --> 01:29:04,860
Drinking a beer in a minute cause I'm an
American. You think I'm going to read,

1407
01:29:04,920 --> 01:29:07,770
I'm not that extra day.
Going to get dumber.

1408
01:29:07,830 --> 01:29:12,090
That's what I'm doing and be puking
in a fucking BFI. Been behind Dennis.

1409
01:29:12,240 --> 01:29:15,360
All right, here we go. Um, here's
a question for a week, a bill.

1410
01:29:15,660 --> 01:29:16,950
Let me start by saying this.

1411
01:29:17,010 --> 01:29:21,360
This question stems from event
spanning over the last six years or so.

1412
01:29:21,840 --> 01:29:23,880
About six years ago at the age of 20,

1413
01:29:23,940 --> 01:29:28,940
I was about a year and a half into what
at the time seem to be a really great

1414
01:29:29,311 --> 01:29:31,710
relationship.
Coincidentally,

1415
01:29:31,740 --> 01:29:34,890
my job and money situation
was also doing really well.

1416
01:29:36,750 --> 01:29:40,920
Um, so I decided instead of
throwing my money away on rent,

1417
01:29:40,950 --> 01:29:45,180
I buy a house. There you go. This guy's
making the moves. He's doing well in life.

1418
01:29:45,510 --> 01:29:50,460
He's buying a house. Everything's good.
So far, being that I always plan ahead.

1419
01:29:50,461 --> 01:29:53,610
I purchased a rather nice
house for a first home,

1420
01:29:54,180 --> 01:29:58,950
even though I thought, uh, he said,

1421
01:29:58,951 --> 01:30:02,570
even thought I knew it, even though I
knew it was a little too much money. Um,

1422
01:30:02,910 --> 01:30:06,570
now I didn't decide I didn't buy
this to start a family or for her.

1423
01:30:06,571 --> 01:30:08,490
I just wanted a fucking house.

1424
01:30:09,800 --> 01:30:12,860
I'm in the year or so after the
relationship really went downhill,

1425
01:30:12,870 --> 01:30:16,890
mainly because I was working more in
spending less time and money on her.

1426
01:30:18,510 --> 01:30:23,040
Um, okay. Uh, long story short,
we split about two years later.

1427
01:30:23,041 --> 01:30:26,760
Since then, I've had many encounters
with girls. Okay. So let me,

1428
01:30:27,630 --> 01:30:30,870
let me fix this with my awful
reading. All right. Basically,

1429
01:30:30,871 --> 01:30:32,910
this guy's dating a girl.
He's making good money.

1430
01:30:32,940 --> 01:30:35,700
He doesn't want to throw his money
down the toilet, pay in rent.

1431
01:30:35,701 --> 01:30:40,170
So he goes and he buys in house and then
now he's got a nut to fucking crack.

1432
01:30:40,170 --> 01:30:41,700
Every month he works a little bit more.

1433
01:30:41,701 --> 01:30:45,390
He's not spending time with his woman
and it goes downhill. Plus he's younger.

1434
01:30:45,720 --> 01:30:48,120
That's pretty normal,
except the fact that he owns a house.

1435
01:30:48,420 --> 01:30:50,160
So now he's in this situation,
he's single.

1436
01:30:50,161 --> 01:30:53,580
He has this really nice house and this is
what's been happening since. All right.

1437
01:30:53,581 --> 01:30:56,880
Since then,
I've had many encounters with girls.

1438
01:30:57,240 --> 01:31:02,240
The one thing they have all had in common
is their hatred and animosity towards

1439
01:31:03,001 --> 01:31:05,010
my ex-girlfriend and my house.

1440
01:31:05,730 --> 01:31:10,290
I've even heard them say things about
sleeping in a bed I bought with her or how

1441
01:31:10,291 --> 01:31:13,890
they don't like it that I did all
this with uh, with the other girl.

1442
01:31:14,430 --> 01:31:18,960
I'd been dating a girl for about two
years now and she's the same way. Uh,

1443
01:31:18,990 --> 01:31:23,760
she even has problems with my dogs
because she says they were her dogs,

1444
01:31:23,790 --> 01:31:28,740
meaning the ex. My question is this,
why is it never good enough? Well,

1445
01:31:28,741 --> 01:31:31,350
if you're a fan of this podcast,
you've already asked that question,

1446
01:31:31,351 --> 01:31:34,920
but I think it's timeless. So I'm going
to, that's why I'm reading this again.

1447
01:31:35,100 --> 01:31:38,430
Am I supposed to start my life over
every time I want to begin a new

1448
01:31:38,431 --> 01:31:42,690
relationship or is it that girls are
really always want to have what they can.

1449
01:31:42,750 --> 01:31:47,750
They cannot have half the country nowadays
are just waiting for some guy to put

1450
01:31:48,001 --> 01:31:50,040
them up in a house and
take care of everything.

1451
01:31:50,190 --> 01:31:51,690
But when you give them the chance,

1452
01:31:52,370 --> 01:31:56,190
the they bitch because they didn't
get to pick the fucking drapes.

1453
01:32:00,560 --> 01:32:03,120
Ah, this guy's making some good points
near, I'm going to need your help pair.

1454
01:32:03,121 --> 01:32:05,470
He said, uh, I don't, uh, I don't get it.

1455
01:32:05,790 --> 01:32:08,740
I've done really well for myself
and I've done it on my own.

1456
01:32:09,010 --> 01:32:11,980
None of that had anything to do
with who I was dating at the time.

1457
01:32:11,981 --> 01:32:14,470
And I hate the feeling bad
because I'm trying to make,

1458
01:32:14,860 --> 01:32:19,420
because I'm trying to better
myself. What's your take? All right,

1459
01:32:19,940 --> 01:32:22,720
Nia, what, what did you say on this? You
actually summed it up really well here.

1460
01:32:23,050 --> 01:32:25,570
What do you, what do you think about this
guy? Just to, just to reiterate, you know,

1461
01:32:25,571 --> 01:32:28,900
the deal. What, what, what
is, uh, what is his problem?

1462
01:32:29,950 --> 01:32:34,120
I think the problem is the kind of people
that he dates cause I don't think that

1463
01:32:34,540 --> 01:32:39,170
there mature enough. So like let go
of the past, you know what I mean?

1464
01:32:39,730 --> 01:32:42,550
It's like, of course he's dated other
women, of course. You know what I mean?

1465
01:32:42,551 --> 01:32:47,230
It's not, yeah, but let me ask you this.
If, if when I met you already had a house,

1466
01:32:47,290 --> 01:32:48,123
right.

1467
01:32:48,140 --> 01:32:51,890
And uh, it was, you know, it had a
little bit of the female touch to it,

1468
01:32:52,070 --> 01:32:54,140
you know what I mean?
Yeah. You know what I mean?

1469
01:32:54,141 --> 01:32:56,990
It's not like you walked in and there was
just a coffee table and like fucking a

1470
01:32:57,860 --> 01:33:00,650
playstation, you know, popcorn in
the cushions or whatever. Right.

1471
01:33:00,651 --> 01:33:02,170
I'm not saying this house looks like that,
but you know.

1472
01:33:02,260 --> 01:33:03,850
Right. Yeah. No. If it looked like,

1473
01:33:04,540 --> 01:33:07,640
and I still had the bed that I
used to bang the other one me,

1474
01:33:07,950 --> 01:33:10,600
then I'll say at least she can do it.
Dude, you can least switch out the bed.

1475
01:33:10,840 --> 01:33:13,870
You know what I mean? Bed though.
I thought, I think that's a little,

1476
01:33:13,990 --> 01:33:18,850
I think that's a little much, honestly.
What a little much to still have it. Yeah.

1477
01:33:18,970 --> 01:33:20,440
He's going to buy it.
Do you? How much bets?

1478
01:33:21,100 --> 01:33:24,440
Cause you don't have him buy a whole new
bed just cause he's slept with somebody

1479
01:33:24,441 --> 01:33:29,000
else on it. Ladies. Can you see why
this is my girl? You're the shit.

1480
01:33:29,150 --> 01:33:30,890
Yeah,
because I mean how many,

1481
01:33:30,950 --> 01:33:34,490
when you're dating somebody and you
have sex with them in their house,

1482
01:33:34,640 --> 01:33:38,180
chances are they've had sex with somebody
else in their bed before you anyway.

1483
01:33:38,630 --> 01:33:41,750
So now all of a sudden it's
like a big deal because no,

1484
01:33:42,040 --> 01:33:44,810
he needs to date some more mature girls,

1485
01:33:44,811 --> 01:33:48,260
but he's been dating someone for two
years. I don't know what he's been doing.

1486
01:33:48,470 --> 01:33:51,950
I thought you said he, I just
focus on saying the words, right?

1487
01:33:54,580 --> 01:33:58,270
Yeah. He says, you know what?
You know what this, this
house could be like the lock,

1488
01:33:58,300 --> 01:34:02,950
the lock, the door test in them in a
Bronx tale. Oh yeah, that's true. Yeah.

1489
01:34:02,951 --> 01:34:05,560
Like if they can't deal with it and they
start giving me shit and you give him

1490
01:34:05,561 --> 01:34:10,120
the heave Ho. Exactly. I think they
should get the heave Ho this is my house.

1491
01:34:10,210 --> 01:34:13,610
This is where I fuck you want in the,

1492
01:34:13,830 --> 01:34:18,130
not quite so asshole. But if
anything he could, you know,

1493
01:34:18,770 --> 01:34:22,220
get some new sheets or something,
you know, obviously. Yeah,

1494
01:34:22,400 --> 01:34:24,230
the bed bath and beyond.
I was thinking about some new sheets.

1495
01:34:24,231 --> 01:34:28,850
You want to help me pick out? Some
girl would love that. Love it. Yeah.

1496
01:34:28,851 --> 01:34:30,650
There you go. Yeah, there you go. Yeah,

1497
01:34:30,860 --> 01:34:33,450
and what point in the relationship
should he do that? You know,

1498
01:34:33,451 --> 01:34:36,600
cause we don't like being tied down.
I want to send the wrong message.

1499
01:34:36,630 --> 01:34:39,090
I don't want to say that I love you,
but I want you to still bang me.

1500
01:34:39,210 --> 01:34:43,950
Like at what point?
I think when it's like official date,

1501
01:34:43,980 --> 01:34:47,910
like a monogamous type thing is when
you can say, hey, let's you know.

1502
01:34:48,420 --> 01:34:52,830
Okay. All right. That's really, you
answered the question, don't oversell it.

1503
01:34:52,950 --> 01:34:57,060
You answered it. It gets really
annoying that these girls would be like,

1504
01:34:57,080 --> 01:34:58,100
oh my God,
I can't

1505
01:34:58,100 --> 01:35:03,100
believe you that you know this is already
decorated and these are her dogs and

1506
01:35:04,290 --> 01:35:07,840
this is her house. And I can tell that
she said that there. That's stupid.

1507
01:35:07,841 --> 01:35:09,730
That's really how la girls say.

1508
01:35:09,731 --> 01:35:13,100
Favorite after that fabric.

1509
01:35:16,680 --> 01:35:19,860
All right. All right. I think that's
going to be the podcast this week.

1510
01:35:19,861 --> 01:35:21,810
So I guess so that's your answer
right there when you know,

1511
01:35:21,811 --> 01:35:24,550
I'm not going to always
defer those, uh, Tinea,

1512
01:35:24,600 --> 01:35:28,350
but I just think sometimes you're really
asking me what women are thinking and I

1513
01:35:28,351 --> 01:35:32,610
think I've done enough trashing
of women and uh, shut up.

1514
01:35:33,960 --> 01:35:36,840
Um, I've done enough trash,
one of them. And you know,

1515
01:35:37,140 --> 01:35:40,170
that's actually a serious question here
because still you don't want to get that

1516
01:35:40,230 --> 01:35:43,250
in a situation where,
I mean you have to,

1517
01:35:43,550 --> 01:35:45,730
I mean literally sell the house.

1518
01:35:45,731 --> 01:35:50,460
What if it's a bad fucking market just to
appease her. That's ridiculous. But, uh,

1519
01:35:50,850 --> 01:35:52,490
I, I w I, you know something, yeah,

1520
01:35:52,491 --> 01:35:56,600
I would actually say that if they were
actually going to be getting married,

1521
01:35:57,830 --> 01:36:00,660
you know,
if they take it to that level and uh,

1522
01:36:00,980 --> 01:36:03,500
there'll be a weird thing because when
you do get married and you want to pick

1523
01:36:03,501 --> 01:36:07,010
out a house, it's the house that for
both of you that you want to live in.

1524
01:36:07,160 --> 01:36:10,100
And you know, this houses out there
that I just don't get like that though.

1525
01:36:10,430 --> 01:36:13,460
You know that gingerbread looking
house sits up to fucking street? Yeah.

1526
01:36:13,610 --> 01:36:14,150
Like you know,

1527
01:36:14,150 --> 01:36:17,300
if I met the girl and my dreams and she
lived in that house and every everyday

1528
01:36:17,301 --> 01:36:19,490
driving, ah, I hate this fucking house.

1529
01:36:20,240 --> 01:36:24,750
You know all those ones that look like
the castles, that employee. But they're,

1530
01:36:24,940 --> 01:36:27,800
they're just a house so it looks stupid.
You know,

1531
01:36:27,980 --> 01:36:30,980
Rapunzel let down your hair or
just sort of hop out that window.

1532
01:36:35,680 --> 01:36:39,920
No, I, I do. I know, I respect
that, but I'm saying I, this
is what I was saying like,

1533
01:36:40,010 --> 01:36:43,160
you know, come on in and live here.
I get that. But then you know,

1534
01:36:43,580 --> 01:36:45,980
I'm sure we didn't buy a house
that's big enough to have like a,

1535
01:36:46,040 --> 01:36:50,110
like a big family. I don't
know if he does. I don't know.

1536
01:36:50,111 --> 01:36:53,000
I'm just trying to kind of balance it out.

01:36:53,300 --> 01:36:55,250
Nia,

Because I'm going to get
hammered today. A drag. Why?

1539
01:36:58,730 --> 01:37:00,890
I was designated driver last time.

1540
01:37:02,490 --> 01:37:05,040
Last time when last time.
