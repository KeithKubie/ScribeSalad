00:00:07.979 --> 00:00:12.821
When Reverend Jim Jones founded
the Peoples Temple in 1955,

00:00:12.821 --> 00:00:16.352
few could have imagined 
its horrifying end.

00:00:16.352 --> 00:00:20.663
This progressive religious movement
rose in popularity and gained support

00:00:20.663 --> 00:00:24.682
from some of San Francisco's 
most prominent politicians.

00:00:24.682 --> 00:00:29.122
But in 1977, amidst revelations
of brainwashing and abuse,

00:00:29.122 --> 00:00:31.652
Jones moved with several hundred followers

00:00:31.652 --> 00:00:36.284
to establish the commune of Jonestown 
in Guyana.

00:00:36.284 --> 00:00:40.721
Billed as a utopian paradise,
the colony was more like a prison camp,

00:00:40.721 --> 00:00:44.952
and when a congressional delegation
arrived to investigate its conditions,

00:00:44.952 --> 00:00:48.183
Jones executed his final plan.

00:00:48.183 --> 00:00:54.242
On November 18, 1978, 909 men,
women, and children died

00:00:54.242 --> 00:00:58.361
after being forced to drink 
poisoned Flavor Aid.

00:00:58.361 --> 00:01:02.952
That grizzly image has since been
immortalized as shorthand slang

00:01:02.952 --> 00:01:06.013
for single-minded cult-like thinking,

00:01:06.013 --> 00:01:08.525
"They drank the Kool-aid."

00:01:08.525 --> 00:01:11.673
Today, there are thousands of cults
around the world.

00:01:11.673 --> 00:01:14.524
It's important to note two things
about them.

00:01:14.524 --> 00:01:17.412
First, not all cults are religious.

00:01:17.412 --> 00:01:18.622
Some are political,

00:01:18.622 --> 00:01:19.774
therapy-based,

00:01:19.774 --> 00:01:21.434
focused on self-improvement,

00:01:21.434 --> 00:01:22.974
or otherwise.

00:01:22.974 --> 00:01:23.994
And on the flip side,

00:01:23.994 --> 00:01:28.563
not all new religions are what 
we're referring to as cults.

00:01:28.563 --> 00:01:31.933
So what exactly defines our modern
understanding of cults,

00:01:31.933 --> 00:01:35.125
and why do people join them?

00:01:35.125 --> 00:01:37.754
Broadly speaking, a cult is a group
or movement

00:01:37.754 --> 00:01:41.944
with a shared commitment to a usually
extreme ideology

00:01:41.944 --> 00:01:45.591
that's typically embodied
in a charismatic leader.

00:01:45.591 --> 00:01:49.155
And while few turn out as deadly
as Jonestown or Heaven's Gate,

00:01:49.155 --> 00:01:53.754
which ended in a mass suicide 
of 39 people in 1997,

00:01:53.754 --> 00:01:58.095
most cults share some 
basic characteristics.

00:01:58.095 --> 00:02:01.592
A typical cult requires a high level
of commitment from its members

00:02:01.592 --> 00:02:04.033
and maintains a strict hierarchy,

00:02:04.033 --> 00:02:06.945
separating unsuspecting supporters
and recruits

00:02:06.945 --> 00:02:09.203
from the inner workings.

00:02:09.203 --> 00:02:12.344
It claims to provide answers
to life's biggest questions

00:02:12.344 --> 00:02:13.864
through its doctrine,

00:02:13.864 --> 00:02:16.245
along with the required recipe
for change

00:02:16.245 --> 00:02:20.076
that shapes a new member
into a true believer.

00:02:20.076 --> 00:02:24.106
And most importantly, it uses both
formal and informal systems

00:02:24.106 --> 00:02:28.106
of influence and control
to keep members obedient,

00:02:28.106 --> 00:02:33.506
with little tolerance for internal 
disagreement or external scrutiny.

00:02:33.506 --> 00:02:36.596
You might wonder whether 
some of these descriptions

00:02:36.596 --> 00:02:39.826
might also apply to established religions.

00:02:39.826 --> 00:02:42.677
In fact, the world "cultus" 
originally described

00:02:42.677 --> 00:02:46.154
people who cultivated
the worship of certain gods

00:02:46.154 --> 00:02:49.477
by performing rituals 
and maintaining temples.

00:02:49.477 --> 00:02:53.048
But in time, it came to mean 
excessive devotion.

00:02:53.048 --> 00:02:55.196
Many religions began as cults,

00:02:55.196 --> 00:02:59.846
but integrated into the fabric
of the larger society as they grew.

00:02:59.846 --> 00:03:03.987
A modern cult, by contrast, separates
its members from others.

00:03:03.987 --> 00:03:07.857
Rather than providing guidelines
for members to live better lives,

00:03:07.857 --> 00:03:10.448
a cult seeks to directly control them,

00:03:10.448 --> 00:03:12.378
from personal and family relationships,

00:03:12.378 --> 00:03:15.777
to financial assets 
and living arrangements.

00:03:15.777 --> 00:03:18.918
Cults also demand obedience 
to human leaders

00:03:18.918 --> 00:03:21.147
who tend to be highly persuasive people

00:03:21.147 --> 00:03:24.178
with authoritarian 
and narcissistic streaks

00:03:24.178 --> 00:03:29.539
motivated by money, sex, power,
or all three.

00:03:29.539 --> 00:03:33.698
While a cult leader uses personal charisma
to attract initial followers,

00:03:33.698 --> 00:03:37.438
further expansion works 
like a pyramid scheme,

00:03:37.438 --> 00:03:40.839
with early members recruiting new ones.

00:03:40.839 --> 00:03:43.599
Cults are skilled at knowing 
whom to target,

00:03:43.599 --> 00:03:46.189
often focusing on those new to an area,

00:03:46.189 --> 00:03:51.629
or who have recently undergone some
personal or professional loss.

00:03:51.629 --> 00:03:53.600
Loneliness and a desire for meaning

00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:58.149
make one susceptible to friendly people
offering community.

00:03:58.149 --> 00:04:00.098
The recruitment process can be subtle,

00:04:00.098 --> 00:04:03.489
sometimes taking months
to establish a relationship.

00:04:03.489 --> 00:04:07.521
In fact, more than two-thirds
of cult members are recruited by a friend,

00:04:07.521 --> 00:04:08.640
family member,

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:10.040
or co-worker

00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:13.410
whose invitations are harder to refuse.

00:04:13.410 --> 00:04:18.000
Once in the cult, members are subjected
to multiple forms of indoctrination.

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:24.239
Some play on our natural inclination to
mimic social behaviors or follow orders.

00:04:24.239 --> 00:04:26.209
Other methods may be more intense

00:04:26.209 --> 00:04:32.510
using techniques of coercive persuasion
involving guilt, shame, and fear.

00:04:32.510 --> 00:04:37.773
And in many cases, members may
willingly submit out of desire to belong

00:04:37.773 --> 00:04:40.981
and to attain the promised rewards.

00:04:40.981 --> 00:04:43.821
The cult environment discourages
critical thinking,

00:04:43.821 --> 00:04:45.631
making it hard to voice doubts

00:04:45.631 --> 00:04:50.103
when everyone around you is modeling
absolute faith.

00:04:50.103 --> 00:04:53.891
The resulting internal conflict,
known as cognitive dissonance,

00:04:53.891 --> 00:04:55.541
keeps you trapped,

00:04:55.541 --> 00:05:01.011
as each compromise makes it more 
painful to admit you've been deceived.

00:05:01.011 --> 00:05:03.602
And though most cults don't
lead members to their death,

00:05:03.602 --> 00:05:05.751
they can still be harmful.

00:05:05.751 --> 00:05:09.360
By denying basic freedoms of thought,
speech, and association,

00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:13.882
cults stunt their members'
psychological and emotional growth,

00:05:13.882 --> 00:05:16.223
a particular problem for children,

00:05:16.223 --> 00:05:20.672
who are deprived of normal
developmental activities and milestones.

00:05:20.672 --> 00:05:24.553
Nevertheless, many cult members
eventually find a way out,

00:05:24.553 --> 00:05:26.283
whether through their own realizations,

00:05:26.283 --> 00:05:27.833
the help of family and friends,

00:05:27.833 --> 00:05:33.323
or when the cult falls apart
due to external pressure or scandals.

00:05:33.323 --> 00:05:35.953
Many cults may be hard to identify,

00:05:35.953 --> 00:05:39.394
and for some, their beliefs,
no matter how strange,

00:05:39.394 --> 00:05:42.283
are protected under religious freedom.

00:05:42.283 --> 00:05:44.516
But when their practices 
involve harassment,

00:05:44.516 --> 00:05:45.390
threats,

00:05:45.390 --> 00:05:46.733
illegal activities,

00:05:46.733 --> 00:05:47.994
or abuse,

00:05:47.994 --> 00:05:50.713
the law can intervene.

00:05:50.713 --> 00:05:55.532
Believing in something should not come
at the cost of your family and friends,

00:05:55.532 --> 00:05:58.363
and if someone tells you to sacrifice
your relationships

00:05:58.363 --> 00:06:01.176
or morality for the greater good,

00:06:01.176 --> 00:06:04.795
they're most likely exploiting you
for their own.
