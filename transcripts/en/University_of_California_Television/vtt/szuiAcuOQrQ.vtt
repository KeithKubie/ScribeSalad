00:00:00.938 --> 00:00:03.887
- [Announcer] This UCSD-TV
program is presented by

00:00:03.887 --> 00:00:06.429
University of California Television.

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:22.851
(contemplative contemporary music)

00:00:22.851 --> 00:00:25.765
- [Narrator] We are the paradoxical ape.

00:00:25.765 --> 00:00:28.265
Bipedal, naked, large-brained,

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:35.088
long the master of fire,
tools, and language,

00:00:35.088 --> 00:00:38.505
but still trying to understand ourselves.

00:00:39.361 --> 00:00:42.588
Aware that death is inevitable,

00:00:42.588 --> 00:00:44.671
yet filled with optimism.

00:00:45.874 --> 00:00:47.374
We grow up slowly.

00:00:48.265 --> 00:00:50.878
We hand down knowledge.

00:00:50.878 --> 00:00:52.961
We empathize and deceive.

00:00:54.361 --> 00:00:56.125
We shape the future from our shared

00:00:56.125 --> 00:00:58.292
understanding of the past.

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:03.573
CARTA brings together experts
from diverse disciplines

00:01:03.573 --> 00:01:07.740
to exchange insights on who
we are and how we got here.

00:01:09.715 --> 00:01:11.363
An exploration made possible by

00:01:11.363 --> 00:01:14.196
the generosity of humans like you.

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:33.240
(piano music)

00:02:01.419 --> 00:02:04.333
- I'd like to begin by acknowledging

00:02:04.333 --> 00:02:06.658
and appreciating the
talk that we just heard,

00:02:06.658 --> 00:02:09.850
which really emphasizes
that animals and humans

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:12.509
can get the same diseases
and yet physicians

00:02:12.509 --> 00:02:16.561
and veterinarians rarely
consult with one another.

00:02:16.561 --> 00:02:19.022
And that human and non-human
animal commonalities

00:02:19.022 --> 00:02:21.762
can be used to diagnose, treat, and heal

00:02:21.762 --> 00:02:23.762
patients of all species.

00:02:25.292 --> 00:02:27.413
And I also would like to acknowledge

00:02:27.413 --> 00:02:30.234
that this comes as, Barbara pointed out,

00:02:30.234 --> 00:02:33.021
from a long lineage
that goes back to Osler,

00:02:33.021 --> 00:02:34.902
and one of those steps along the way

00:02:34.902 --> 00:02:36.376
was one of our own here.

00:02:36.376 --> 00:02:38.338
Kurt Benirschke unfortunately
couldn't be here

00:02:38.338 --> 00:02:40.753
because of an illness,
the founding director

00:02:40.753 --> 00:02:43.547
of CRESS and professor of pathology here

00:02:43.547 --> 00:02:46.716
who really emphasized one medicine.

00:02:46.716 --> 00:02:49.665
So, I'd like to flip the coin around,

00:02:49.665 --> 00:02:52.359
in science there's always
two sides to every coin,

00:02:52.359 --> 00:02:55.877
and say, are there
human-specific diseases?

00:02:55.877 --> 00:02:57.351
So what we've been hearing about is

00:02:57.351 --> 00:03:00.637
the evolution, biology, and diseases

00:03:00.637 --> 00:03:02.436
of a large variety of animals,

00:03:02.436 --> 00:03:05.664
mostly warm-blooded social
animals, vertebrates,

00:03:05.664 --> 00:03:08.532
and you can see an entire lineage here.

00:03:08.532 --> 00:03:10.784
Let's zoom in on the
group that we belong to,

00:03:10.784 --> 00:03:14.069
primates, and zoom in further.

00:03:14.069 --> 00:03:15.625
And among these primates we have

00:03:15.625 --> 00:03:18.162
New World monkeys, Old World monkeys,

00:03:18.162 --> 00:03:21.436
gibbons, various so-called great apes,

00:03:21.436 --> 00:03:23.019
and then us humans.

00:03:24.106 --> 00:03:26.649
If we zoom in further here, we can see

00:03:26.649 --> 00:03:29.226
that we shared common ancestors with

00:03:29.226 --> 00:03:33.150
orangutans, gorillas,
chimpanzees, bonobos,

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:36.796
just a very short time
ago in evolutionary time.

00:03:36.796 --> 00:03:38.421
And here's another way to look at it.

00:03:38.421 --> 00:03:40.104
In millions of years before present

00:03:40.104 --> 00:03:43.657
there's certainly some
discussion about the time frame.

00:03:43.657 --> 00:03:47.047
But a very important
point to make here is that

00:03:47.047 --> 00:03:49.009
while we classified all these species

00:03:49.009 --> 00:03:51.831
as great apes, the main difference between

00:03:51.831 --> 00:03:54.245
chimpanzees and bonobos is less than

00:03:54.245 --> 00:03:57.728
1% of their amino acid sequence level.

00:03:57.728 --> 00:03:59.400
In fact, we are closer to bonobos and

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:02.186
chimpanzees than they are to gorillas.

00:04:02.186 --> 00:04:04.357
In fact, we are closer to chimpanzees

00:04:04.357 --> 00:04:07.062
than mice and rats are to each other.

00:04:07.062 --> 00:04:09.674
So, really, the classification
should be like this.

00:04:09.674 --> 00:04:13.239
We are hominids and
then among the hominids

00:04:13.239 --> 00:04:16.199
the lineage leading to us are hominins.

00:04:16.199 --> 00:04:19.589
So, if you have a species that is 99%

00:04:19.589 --> 00:04:21.400
identical to us the protein level,

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:23.072
how could you possibly have anything

00:04:23.072 --> 00:04:24.419
that's different between them?

00:04:24.419 --> 00:04:26.056
And in fact, when I
first got into this field

00:04:26.056 --> 00:04:28.758
I found out that the veterinarians at

00:04:28.758 --> 00:04:30.859
the primate centers I went to were using

00:04:30.859 --> 00:04:33.019
Harrison's textbook of Internal Medicine.

00:04:33.019 --> 00:04:34.911
Same textbook I'd used.

00:04:34.911 --> 00:04:36.955
So that made sense.

00:04:36.955 --> 00:04:38.220
But if you want to say
there's such a thing

00:04:38.220 --> 00:04:40.635
as a human specific disease, it's gotta be

00:04:40.635 --> 00:04:43.723
very common in humans, rarely reported

00:04:43.723 --> 00:04:45.488
in closely related species.

00:04:45.488 --> 00:04:46.591
Now this is very important.

00:04:46.591 --> 00:04:48.182
I'm zooming in on this clade, not about

00:04:48.182 --> 00:04:50.271
things that happened or distant portions

00:04:50.271 --> 00:04:52.814
of evolution, even in captivity

00:04:52.814 --> 00:04:55.275
and could not be experimentally reproduced

00:04:55.275 --> 00:04:57.191
in such species, and I should warn you,

00:04:57.191 --> 00:04:59.559
I'm gonna talk about a few really horrible

00:04:59.559 --> 00:05:01.405
experiments that were done a long time ago

00:05:01.405 --> 00:05:03.193
that'll never be done again.

00:05:03.193 --> 00:05:04.912
So there's a caveat.

00:05:04.912 --> 00:05:06.386
Who do you compare with?

00:05:06.386 --> 00:05:08.023
In my opinion, reliable information

00:05:08.023 --> 00:05:10.055
is limited to data on a few thousand

00:05:10.055 --> 00:05:13.375
great apes in captivity,
which are cared for

00:05:13.375 --> 00:05:16.449
at NIH-funded facilities with full

00:05:16.449 --> 00:05:17.912
veterinary care, probably better

00:05:17.912 --> 00:05:20.570
medical care than most Americans get,

00:05:20.570 --> 00:05:22.532
and full necropsies.

00:05:22.532 --> 00:05:25.354
So this is a reasonable data
set to compare with humans.

00:05:25.354 --> 00:05:27.234
I think, comparing with wild chimpanzees

00:05:27.234 --> 00:05:31.151
and self-domesticated
humans isn't that useful,

00:05:32.366 --> 00:05:34.816
in this question that we're going to ask.

00:05:34.816 --> 00:05:37.033
So when I went to the
Yerkes Primate Center

00:05:37.033 --> 00:05:38.615
and other centers and asked, and said,

00:05:38.615 --> 00:05:39.927
what's the commonest cause of death

00:05:39.927 --> 00:05:43.479
in captive adult chimpanzees,
they said heart disease.

00:05:43.479 --> 00:05:45.000
Heart attacks, heart failures.

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:46.962
So I said, oh, it's the same thing.

00:05:46.962 --> 00:05:49.029
But then my wife, Nissi
Varki, who is a pathologist

00:05:49.029 --> 00:05:51.130
went to see what was going on,

00:05:51.130 --> 00:05:52.477
she came back and said, "You fool, it's

00:05:52.477 --> 00:05:55.565
"mostly a different disease."

00:05:55.565 --> 00:05:58.009
And so we got together with
various experts across,

00:05:58.009 --> 00:06:00.133
including Kurt, and wrote this article

00:06:00.133 --> 00:06:02.850
that says, heart disease
is common in humans

00:06:02.850 --> 00:06:05.509
and chimpanzees, but is mostly caused by

00:06:05.509 --> 00:06:08.585
different pathological processes.

00:06:08.585 --> 00:06:10.176
So in comparing these two species,

00:06:10.176 --> 00:06:11.767
amazingly it turns out that while

00:06:11.767 --> 00:06:13.938
we humans, essentially
all of our heart attacks

00:06:13.938 --> 00:06:16.260
are due to what you heard
about atherosclerotic

00:06:16.260 --> 00:06:18.558
coronary blockage in the arteries,

00:06:18.558 --> 00:06:20.393
chimpanzees do get atherosclerosis but

00:06:20.393 --> 00:06:23.713
it rarely ever leads
to coronary thrombosis.

00:06:23.713 --> 00:06:26.442
Instead, they get this
very peculiar kind of

00:06:26.442 --> 00:06:30.911
scarring in the myocardium,
the heart muscle,

00:06:30.911 --> 00:06:33.291
fibrosis, so-called interstitial

00:06:33.291 --> 00:06:35.462
myocardial fibrosis in great apes.

00:06:35.462 --> 00:06:38.249
This gives rise to abnormal rhythms,

00:06:38.249 --> 00:06:41.058
heart failure, and heart attacks.

00:06:41.058 --> 00:06:42.904
So it looks like humans but at autopsy

00:06:42.904 --> 00:06:45.145
it's a different disease.

00:06:45.145 --> 00:06:46.585
In fact, since we wrote this article

00:06:46.585 --> 00:06:48.837
and others put this out, it has become

00:06:48.837 --> 00:06:51.577
so well-recognized that interstitial

00:06:51.577 --> 00:06:54.561
myocardial fibrosis is such a major

00:06:54.561 --> 00:06:57.011
common in captive great
apes in all the zoos,

00:06:57.011 --> 00:06:59.344
that all the zoos led by Zoo Atlanta

00:06:59.344 --> 00:07:01.260
have gotten together and found a network

00:07:01.260 --> 00:07:03.501
to figure out what is this disease

00:07:03.501 --> 00:07:06.740
and why is it killing all our great apes?

00:07:06.740 --> 00:07:09.317
And so there are two
mysteries to be solved.

00:07:09.317 --> 00:07:12.138
One is, why do we humans not often

00:07:12.138 --> 00:07:14.553
get this fibrotic heart
disease that's so common

00:07:14.553 --> 00:07:17.131
in closest evolutionary cousins?

00:07:17.131 --> 00:07:19.917
Conversely, why do
great apes not often get

00:07:19.917 --> 00:07:21.071
the the kind of heart disease we get

00:07:21.071 --> 00:07:22.708
that's so common in humans?

00:07:22.708 --> 00:07:24.508
Since we're genetically so similar,

00:07:24.508 --> 00:07:27.294
there must be very
limited number of reasons.

00:07:27.294 --> 00:07:29.744
You'd immediately say,
ah, it's just cholesterol.

00:07:29.744 --> 00:07:33.227
In fact cholesterol is the leading thing

00:07:33.227 --> 00:07:35.479
that pushes atherosclerotic heart disease.

00:07:35.479 --> 00:07:36.965
But look at this figure here.

00:07:36.965 --> 00:07:39.150
And look at, above is the black line.

00:07:39.150 --> 00:07:41.078
The chimpanzee levels of cholesterol,

00:07:41.078 --> 00:07:43.040
even at birth and soon after birth

00:07:43.040 --> 00:07:44.561
in the first decade are so high that

00:07:44.561 --> 00:07:46.813
they should be on statins.

00:07:46.813 --> 00:07:49.646
And they have similar HDL levels.

00:07:49.646 --> 00:07:51.570
They have APOE4 ancestral allele,

00:07:51.570 --> 00:07:55.157
higher Lp(a) levels, sedentary lifestyles,

00:07:55.157 --> 00:07:57.329
hypertension, and so on.

00:07:57.329 --> 00:07:59.825
Now to be fair, there are some amino acid

00:07:59.825 --> 00:08:02.449
differences in those two
very important proteins

00:08:02.449 --> 00:08:04.538
and that may be part of the story.

00:08:04.538 --> 00:08:06.222
So based on this kind of work,

00:08:06.222 --> 00:08:08.265
Nissi Varki and I went to several of

00:08:08.265 --> 00:08:09.821
these primate centers and tried to learn

00:08:09.821 --> 00:08:12.561
more about these bio-medical differences.

00:08:12.561 --> 00:08:14.221
In this case we are
focusing on differences.

00:08:14.221 --> 00:08:16.440
I want to be clear, there
are many similarities,

00:08:16.440 --> 00:08:18.867
which I'm not gonna talk about.

00:08:18.867 --> 00:08:21.711
And so, we of course work
on sialic acid biology,

00:08:21.711 --> 00:08:23.476
that's another story for another day,

00:08:23.476 --> 00:08:27.031
but this article also talks
about those differences.

00:08:27.031 --> 00:08:28.703
So here's a list of candidates for

00:08:28.703 --> 00:08:31.512
human-specific diseases
that I call definite,

00:08:31.512 --> 00:08:34.066
meaning the data so far
suggests that long list.

00:08:34.066 --> 00:08:36.017
Obviously I'm not gonna
go through the whole list.

00:08:36.017 --> 00:08:37.782
I'll give you a few examples.

00:08:37.782 --> 00:08:39.128
The big one of course that I mentioned

00:08:39.128 --> 00:08:41.056
is this remarkable difference in

00:08:41.056 --> 00:08:43.145
the rates of coronary thrombosis was

00:08:43.145 --> 00:08:45.526
interstitial myocardial fibrosis.

00:08:45.526 --> 00:08:47.940
In fact, spontaneous coronary thrombosis

00:08:47.940 --> 00:08:49.496
due to atherosclerosis seems to be

00:08:49.496 --> 00:08:51.331
very rare in other animals in the absence

00:08:51.331 --> 00:08:54.767
of experimental genetic
or dietary manipulations.

00:08:54.767 --> 00:08:56.532
And the human-specific mechanisms,

00:08:56.532 --> 00:08:58.622
undoubtedly as mentioned,
have to do partly

00:08:58.622 --> 00:09:00.862
with behavioral and dietary changes,

00:09:00.862 --> 00:09:01.977
although I'm looking forward to

00:09:01.977 --> 00:09:04.194
the talk from Mike Gurven on this

00:09:04.194 --> 00:09:07.132
hunter gatherer heart disease.

00:09:07.132 --> 00:09:10.986
These amino acid changes
in these two proteins,

00:09:10.986 --> 00:09:12.426
and something I'm not gonna go into,

00:09:12.426 --> 00:09:15.050
genetic change in sialic acids that

00:09:15.050 --> 00:09:16.524
seems to have made our immune cells

00:09:16.524 --> 00:09:18.927
much more prone to inflammation

00:09:18.927 --> 00:09:20.262
and also contributes to the effects

00:09:20.262 --> 00:09:21.942
of red meat and heart attacks.

00:09:21.942 --> 00:09:25.013
But that's, of course, a specialized case.

00:09:25.013 --> 00:09:25.907
Here's another disease,

00:09:25.907 --> 00:09:28.519
malignant malaria, the big killer malaria.

00:09:28.519 --> 00:09:30.040
Horrible, horrible studies done in

00:09:30.040 --> 00:09:33.720
the 1920s and 1940s in
the the Belgian Congo.

00:09:33.720 --> 00:09:35.682
Two-way cross transfusions between

00:09:35.682 --> 00:09:37.598
chimpanzees and humans infected or

00:09:37.598 --> 00:09:39.990
non-infected with malaria.

00:09:39.990 --> 00:09:42.288
No evidence of cross-infection.

00:09:42.288 --> 00:09:43.515
Turned out the parasites looked

00:09:43.515 --> 00:09:46.011
the same but are different.

00:09:46.011 --> 00:09:48.148
Fast forward almost a century and work by

00:09:48.148 --> 00:09:50.672
CARTA member Francisco Ayala and others

00:09:50.672 --> 00:09:53.412
showed that all the
falciparum in the world,

00:09:53.412 --> 00:09:55.607
this killer malaria, belongs to a

00:09:55.607 --> 00:09:57.708
very small clade in the midst of

00:09:57.708 --> 00:10:00.657
many, many, many other ape malarias.

00:10:00.657 --> 00:10:02.375
In fact, Barbara Hahn later showed

00:10:02.375 --> 00:10:05.159
the plasma falciparum probably arose

00:10:05.159 --> 00:10:08.874
by a single transfer from
one gorilla to a human,

00:10:08.874 --> 00:10:11.335
some time, we don't know exactly when,

00:10:11.335 --> 00:10:13.169
a few tens of thousands of years ago.

00:10:13.169 --> 00:10:16.188
So Pascal Gagneux summarized it like this,

00:10:16.188 --> 00:10:17.871
ape malarias are very common,

00:10:17.871 --> 00:10:19.717
and because of the sialic acid change

00:10:19.717 --> 00:10:21.563
I'm not going to go into,

00:10:21.563 --> 00:10:25.859
we escaped the target
and we had a free ride

00:10:25.859 --> 00:10:28.437
for a million years or
so but the parasites

00:10:28.437 --> 00:10:30.270
always win in the end.

00:10:31.513 --> 00:10:34.288
And finally, the parasite
in that one transfer

00:10:34.288 --> 00:10:36.912
switched to bind the
human kind of sialic acid,

00:10:36.912 --> 00:10:38.050
and then, of course, we spread the

00:10:38.050 --> 00:10:40.105
mosquitoes in our environment

00:10:40.105 --> 00:10:42.612
and that rest is history.

00:10:42.612 --> 00:10:44.110
Here's another one.

00:10:44.110 --> 00:10:45.875
Typhoid fever, big killer throughout

00:10:45.875 --> 00:10:48.789
human history until very recently.

00:10:48.789 --> 00:10:53.461
And it turns out there's been
a host adaptation to humans.

00:10:53.461 --> 00:10:56.979
Again, most horrible
studies done in the 1960s.

00:10:56.979 --> 00:10:58.860
Large doses of Salmonella typhi

00:10:58.860 --> 00:11:01.647
were given to chimpanzees.

00:11:01.647 --> 00:11:05.257
Survival was much better and they were

00:11:05.257 --> 00:11:07.335
much less sensitive.

00:11:07.335 --> 00:11:09.843
It turns out we found
an explanation for this.

00:11:09.843 --> 00:11:12.037
There's a human kind
of sialic acid shown on

00:11:12.037 --> 00:11:14.000
this side of the screen,
and the other side

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:17.599
of the screen, Gc is the
chimpanzee type of sialic acid.

00:11:17.599 --> 00:11:19.398
And the typhoid toxin only binds to

00:11:19.398 --> 00:11:21.732
the human kind of sialic acid.

00:11:21.732 --> 00:11:24.797
And so, using most models, we can sort of

00:11:24.797 --> 00:11:26.712
show that this is what's going on,

00:11:26.712 --> 00:11:29.418
that you have the
sensitivity and resistance.

00:11:29.418 --> 00:11:30.323
Cholera.

00:11:30.323 --> 00:11:32.877
Robert Koch, the famous
microbiologist said,

00:11:32.877 --> 00:11:34.630
"Although these
experiments were constantly

00:11:34.630 --> 00:11:37.835
"repeated material from
fresh cholera cases,

00:11:37.835 --> 00:11:39.019
"our mice remained healthy.

00:11:39.019 --> 00:11:40.784
"We then made experiments on monkeys,

00:11:40.784 --> 00:11:42.862
"cats, poultry, dogs, and other animals,

00:11:42.862 --> 00:11:44.627
"and we're never able to arrive at

00:11:44.627 --> 00:11:47.827
"anything similar to a cholera process."

00:11:47.827 --> 00:11:51.566
So far, there's nothing
except a baby rabbit model.

00:11:51.566 --> 00:11:53.563
Of course, there's an
explanation for this.

00:11:53.563 --> 00:11:55.591
Now I've been talking mostly
about infectious disease,

00:11:55.591 --> 00:11:57.403
from Jared Diamond and
others, and if you look

00:11:57.403 --> 00:11:58.749
in the bottom of the screen you can see

00:11:58.749 --> 00:12:00.479
that certain diseases like rabies

00:12:00.479 --> 00:12:03.161
can spread throughout many animals.

00:12:03.161 --> 00:12:05.170
And then eventually a
disease makes its way

00:12:05.170 --> 00:12:07.550
into humans and, by what's
called a Red Queen effect,

00:12:07.550 --> 00:12:10.870
becomes highly specialized on one species.

00:12:10.870 --> 00:12:12.693
And so some of this is not surprising

00:12:12.693 --> 00:12:16.457
but the fact is, there are such diseases.

00:12:16.457 --> 00:12:18.465
There's one set of
definite diseases though

00:12:18.465 --> 00:12:19.650
that are kind of interesting.

00:12:19.650 --> 00:12:22.355
These are gonorrhea,
various other organisms

00:12:22.355 --> 00:12:24.725
that infect newborns.

00:12:24.725 --> 00:12:26.362
But it appears that what these bacteria

00:12:26.362 --> 00:12:28.522
have done is amend the human kind of

00:12:28.522 --> 00:12:31.029
sialic acid and quote themselves.

00:12:31.029 --> 00:12:34.791
In what my colleague Victor
Nizet calls molecular mimicry,

00:12:34.791 --> 00:12:35.891
(audience laughs)

00:12:35.891 --> 00:12:38.488
they are basically wolves
in sheep's clothing,

00:12:38.488 --> 00:12:41.228
and they are very successful pathogens.

00:12:41.228 --> 00:12:43.155
Okay, so that's some examples,

00:12:43.155 --> 00:12:44.467
I haven't gone through all of them,

00:12:44.467 --> 00:12:46.940
of human-specific diseases,

00:12:46.940 --> 00:12:48.949
that seem to be human-specific.

00:12:48.949 --> 00:12:50.893
What about probable ones?

00:12:50.893 --> 00:12:52.158
Alzheimer's disease.

00:12:52.158 --> 00:12:54.945
Another CARTA member, Tuck
Finch has written this,

00:12:54.945 --> 00:12:58.927
Commentary, is Alzheimer's
disease uniquely human?

00:12:58.927 --> 00:13:01.121
But Alzheimer's disease
may be a human-specific

00:13:01.121 --> 00:13:04.198
disease was hypothesized in 1989.

00:13:04.198 --> 00:13:06.903
"Apes accumulate
considerable amyloid plaques

00:13:06.903 --> 00:13:08.540
"after for 40, and age at which these are

00:13:08.540 --> 00:13:10.096
"uncommon in humans.

00:13:10.096 --> 00:13:12.836
"Despite this early
plaque buildup, ape brains

00:13:12.836 --> 00:13:15.286
"have not shown dystrophic
neurites near plaques.

00:13:15.286 --> 00:13:18.560
"Aging great ape brains
also have few tangles.

00:13:18.560 --> 00:13:21.381
"We cautiously support this hypothesis."

00:13:21.381 --> 00:13:24.156
And this is under further investigation.

00:13:24.156 --> 00:13:26.861
Carcinomas of epithelial origin.

00:13:26.861 --> 00:13:29.293
To date, of these few thousand apes

00:13:29.293 --> 00:13:31.417
cared for in captivity,
not a single case of

00:13:31.417 --> 00:13:33.542
carcinoma of the esophagus, lung, stomach,

00:13:33.542 --> 00:13:37.071
pancreas, colon, uterus,
ovary, or prostate.

00:13:37.071 --> 00:13:38.505
And so, Nissi and I looked into this

00:13:38.505 --> 00:13:41.129
and concluded that
"while relative carcinoma

00:13:41.129 --> 00:13:42.733
"risk is a likely difference between

00:13:42.733 --> 00:13:44.568
"humans and chimpanzees and other apes,

00:13:44.568 --> 00:13:48.445
"a more systematic survey is needed."

00:13:48.445 --> 00:13:52.009
Of course, age is a factor,
not just environment.

00:13:52.009 --> 00:13:54.006
And so you'd say, well,
a lot these diseases

00:13:54.006 --> 00:13:56.294
we're mentioning have to do with age.

00:13:56.294 --> 00:13:58.302
But in fact, chimpanzees in captivity

00:13:58.302 --> 00:14:01.332
can live up to the age of 45, 50,

00:14:01.332 --> 00:14:03.294
occasionally even up to 60.

00:14:03.294 --> 00:14:05.407
And so they're in the age
range, you're looking at

00:14:05.407 --> 00:14:07.126
the rates of human cancer here in

00:14:07.126 --> 00:14:09.369
human males and females,
well, you might expect

00:14:09.369 --> 00:14:12.306
to at least see a few carcinomas,

00:14:12.306 --> 00:14:14.756
a few heart attacks of the human kind,

00:14:14.756 --> 00:14:17.008
and a few early cases of Alzheimer's-like

00:14:17.008 --> 00:14:19.632
disease, but none have been seen.

00:14:19.632 --> 00:14:21.234
Possible examples.

00:14:21.234 --> 00:14:22.465
Another long list.

00:14:22.465 --> 00:14:23.695
And here we have what is called

00:14:23.695 --> 00:14:27.631
absence of evidence is
not evidence of absence.

00:14:27.631 --> 00:14:30.174
We really don't know.

00:14:30.174 --> 00:14:32.924
But it's kind of interesting that

00:14:34.864 --> 00:14:37.651
bronchial asthma, I've been looking for

00:14:37.651 --> 00:14:39.624
a case of bronchial asthma in a great ape,

00:14:39.624 --> 00:14:42.291
or for that matter, in a monkey,

00:14:43.746 --> 00:14:45.836
and there's no papers about this.

00:14:45.836 --> 00:14:47.844
Except there are papers like this.

00:14:47.844 --> 00:14:49.969
Here's a paper about the asthma-like

00:14:49.969 --> 00:14:52.465
syndrome in a single monkey that says,

00:14:52.465 --> 00:14:55.832
"The present case is remarkable in that

00:14:55.832 --> 00:14:57.411
"there's a paucity of reports of

00:14:57.411 --> 00:14:59.158
"naturally occurring allergy

00:14:59.158 --> 00:15:01.294
"airway disease in nonhuman primates."

00:15:01.294 --> 00:15:02.351
Now this could have to do with

00:15:02.351 --> 00:15:04.684
the hygiene hypothesis, other issues,

00:15:04.684 --> 00:15:06.077
remains to be seen.

00:15:06.077 --> 00:15:08.762
Anyway, to conclude, disease profiles

00:15:08.762 --> 00:15:11.246
of humans and chimpanzees
are rather different

00:15:11.246 --> 00:15:14.230
considering how
genetically similar we are.

00:15:14.230 --> 00:15:16.238
Chimpanzees, contrary to the original idea

00:15:16.238 --> 00:15:18.488
of NIH and health sciences,

00:15:20.255 --> 00:15:22.473
are poor models of many human disease,

00:15:22.473 --> 00:15:25.004
and should not be used
to model human diseases

00:15:25.004 --> 00:15:26.757
very often if at all.

00:15:26.757 --> 00:15:28.522
Humans, conversely, are likely to be

00:15:28.522 --> 00:15:31.796
poor models of many chimpanzee diseases.

00:15:31.796 --> 00:15:33.886
So there are huge ethical issues here.

00:15:33.886 --> 00:15:35.751
Chimpanzees are sentient beings.

00:15:35.751 --> 00:15:37.098
I wouldn't do anything to a chimpanzee

00:15:37.098 --> 00:15:39.942
I wouldn't do to a human, and with even

00:15:39.942 --> 00:15:42.485
greater care than with humans.

00:15:42.485 --> 00:15:45.236
And back in 2005, Jim
Moore, Pascal Gagneux,

00:15:45.236 --> 00:15:48.719
and I wrote this ethics
paper, which suggested

00:15:48.719 --> 00:15:50.438
that we conduct research on great apes

00:15:50.438 --> 00:15:52.237
following principles generally similar

00:15:52.237 --> 00:15:54.861
to those accepted for human research.

00:15:54.861 --> 00:15:56.777
And we even suggested that the researchers

00:15:56.777 --> 00:15:59.110
should volunteer to be
subjects in the same studies.

00:15:59.110 --> 00:16:01.397
(audience laughs)

00:16:01.397 --> 00:16:03.393
Since I wrote this, I keep getting

00:16:03.393 --> 00:16:06.586
these letters saying,
please sign this document

00:16:06.586 --> 00:16:10.185
banning all future
research on chimpanzees.

00:16:10.185 --> 00:16:11.984
And my answer is, that's a terrible idea.

00:16:11.984 --> 00:16:15.583
Would you ban all future
research on humans?

00:16:15.583 --> 00:16:17.255
But unfortunately that's what's happened,

00:16:17.255 --> 00:16:20.344
for other reasons, really good reasons of

00:16:20.344 --> 00:16:22.433
getting chimpanzees out of not very good

00:16:22.433 --> 00:16:25.580
facilities and avoiding invasive research.

00:16:25.580 --> 00:16:27.379
The NIH just threw up its hand and has

00:16:27.379 --> 00:16:29.957
stopped all chimpanzee research,

00:16:29.957 --> 00:16:31.884
practically speaking.

00:16:31.884 --> 00:16:33.196
And the question is will the ban on

00:16:33.196 --> 00:16:34.868
chimpanzee research actually do

00:16:34.868 --> 00:16:37.410
more harm than good to both species?

00:16:37.410 --> 00:16:39.210
And I'd add a final corollary,

00:16:39.210 --> 00:16:41.044
chimpanzees would benefit from

00:16:41.044 --> 00:16:44.249
more ethical studies
of their own diseases,

00:16:44.249 --> 00:16:45.758
and I'm hoping that we can still keep

00:16:45.758 --> 00:16:47.685
this area of research open because

00:16:47.685 --> 00:16:49.241
I think it's important both,

00:16:49.241 --> 00:16:52.399
for both humans and chimpanzees

00:16:52.399 --> 00:16:54.477
and the diseases that we both get.

00:16:54.477 --> 00:16:55.708
Thank you.
