00:00:05.469 --> 00:00:09.194
 Android Jetpack will provide modern application architecture 

00:00:09.578 --> 00:00:11.943
 Eliminate boilerplate file code and simplify complex tasks 

00:00:12.439 --> 00:00:14.056
 And providing strong backward compatibility 

00:00:14.495 --> 00:00:16.623
 Speed â€‹â€‹up the Android development process 

00:00:17.997 --> 00:00:19.644
 Architecture Guide in Jetpack 

00:00:20.229 --> 00:00:21.838
 Four key areas in Android development 

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:23.932
 Supported by a series of code libraries and tools 

00:00:24.483 --> 00:00:26.779
 The basis of the architecture UI behavior 

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:29.188
 Each Jetpack component can be used separately 

00:00:29.964 --> 00:00:31.439
 But they still work together smoothly 

00:00:32.239 --> 00:00:34.838
 On the critically acclaimed architecture component released last year 

00:00:35.321 --> 00:00:36.346
 We further improved and launched Jetpack 

00:00:36.663 --> 00:00:38.011
 These components help you develop 

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:40.466
 Highly testable robust application architecture 

00:00:40.848 --> 00:00:43.054
 At the same time, one point for the pain points of developers 

00:00:43.582 --> 00:00:45.947
 Such as life cycle management and data persistence, etc. 

00:00:47.139 --> 00:00:49.154
 We have added 3 architectural components: 

00:00:49.945 --> 00:00:51.901
 Paging navigation work manager 

00:00:52.486 --> 00:00:55.525
 Paging component allows you to source from a local or network source 

00:00:55.884 --> 00:00:57.697
 Step-by-step request-based data loading 

00:00:58.079 --> 00:00:59.946
 So that the application has the ability to handle large data 

00:01:00.486 --> 00:01:01.894
 This includes support for RecyclerView 

00:01:02.906 --> 00:01:04.178
 The navigation component provides a framework 

00:01:04.527 --> 00:01:06.947
 Can be used to build an application process that complies with the Android Design Guidelines 

00:01:07.589 --> 00:01:09.750
 The app flow also has the appropriate behavior for the up and back buttons 

00:01:10.154 --> 00:01:12.351
 Support deep link automatic fragment processing 

00:01:13.295 --> 00:01:16.750
 Support overflow menu navigation drawer and bottom navigation 

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:21.624
 It also comes with a powerful graphical editor from Android Studio. 

00:01:21.961 --> 00:01:25.304
 Allows you to visualize, design and test your app's navigation screens 

00:01:26.002 --> 00:01:30.020
 Work Manager components greatly simplify the process of planning one-time or periodic asynchronous tasks 

00:01:30.606 --> 00:01:35.490
 Tasks can be executed in order, at the same time, or even in more complex settings 

00:01:36.357 --> 00:01:39.635
 You can easily queue tasks and provide restrictions 

00:01:40.038 --> 00:01:42.244
 For example, it requires the use of non-billing network traffic or the use of toll traffic. 

00:01:42.874 --> 00:01:46.115
 Perhaps the most important thing is that the Work Manager component solves the compatibility issue. 

00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:48.895
 So you know what platform the user is on. 

00:01:49.543 --> 00:01:52.858
 Tasks are efficiently scheduled while taking into account the health of the entire system 

00:01:53.669 --> 00:01:56.043
 UI components such as animation, transition, layout, etc. 

00:01:56.515 --> 00:01:59.523
 Such as ConstraintLayout, text, emoticons, clips 

00:02:00.105 --> 00:02:01.997
 Also includes the TV Leanback code base 

00:02:02.335 --> 00:02:04.353
 Wear UI codebase, Auto codebase, etc. 

00:02:04.878 --> 00:02:06.185
 Now they are all members of Jetpack. 

00:02:06.701 --> 00:02:08.505
 Behavioral components support the constantly changing Android zone 

00:02:08.842 --> 00:02:10.653
 Such as notification, permission and sharing, etc. 

00:02:11.192 --> 00:02:12.689
 Jetpack also added support for Slices 

00:02:13.163 --> 00:02:16.302
 It allows your app to display several of its own templated parts separately 

00:02:16.924 --> 00:02:19.229
 For integration with apps like Google Search and Assistant 

00:02:19.847 --> 00:02:21.223
 The base component contains AppCompat 

00:02:21.806 --> 00:02:23.360
 Multiple code bases for automated testing 

00:02:23.855 --> 00:02:25.960
 And the new Android KTX Kotlin extension 

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:28.717
 It will let you use Kotlin for Android development. 

00:02:29.068 --> 00:02:30.474
 More concise, smooth, modern 

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:32.420
 Android Jetpack is just getting started 

00:02:33.117 --> 00:02:34.581
 We are developing a whole set of plans 

00:02:34.918 --> 00:02:35.920
 Utility code libraries and tools 

00:02:36.294 --> 00:02:37.937
 Help your Android project fly 

00:02:38.678 --> 00:02:42.314
