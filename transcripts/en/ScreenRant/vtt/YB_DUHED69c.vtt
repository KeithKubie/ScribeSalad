00:00:07.279 --> 00:00:11.179
After years of several stories on film, it’s
hard to find a narrative that’s 100 percent

00:00:11.179 --> 00:00:17.170
original. Everything seems to take inspiration
from something that’s come before. But sometimes,

00:00:17.170 --> 00:00:21.010
Hollywood hits rock bottom creatively, and
two different studios work on movies that

00:00:21.010 --> 00:00:24.850
have nearly identical plots. The phenomenon
is known as Twin Films!

00:00:24.850 --> 00:00:29.050
Here are Screen Rant’s 10 Movies That Stole
Their Stories From Other Films.

00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:31.230
White House Down and Olympus Has Fallen

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:35.309
We never got to see John McClane in his prime
protect the US President in a Die Hard sequel,

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:39.800
so the studios overcompensated for that in
2013. Dueling action films – Olympus Has

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:43.719
Fallen and White House Down – featured a
lone action hero fighting off a terrorist

00:00:43.719 --> 00:00:47.600
attack at the White House. Olympus went for
the R-rating, and that decision paid off.

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:51.039
It was better received critically and ended
up being more profitable than the “flashier”

00:00:51.039 --> 00:00:55.320
Roland Emmerich flick, which underperformed
at the box office despite its A-list cast.

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:58.000
Out of the two, Olympus was the only one to
warrant a sequel.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.460
Antz and a Bug’s Life

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:04.420
Pixar’s second feature, A Bug’s Life,
is a mostly forgotten entry on their stellar

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:08.500
filmography, but it’s still a strong offering
that has beautiful visuals and a powerful

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:13.000
message. But its premise wasn’t as unique
as some of Pixar’s other films. DreamWorks’

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:17.650
Antz also dealt with a freethinking ant that
falls for a princess and fights to save his

00:01:17.650 --> 00:01:21.810
colony – and even beat Pixar to theaters
by a month. There’s added drama here, as

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:25.880
some feel DreamWorks’ Jeffrey Katzenberger
stole the idea when he left Disney’s animation

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:31.189
department. Both received positive reviews,
but A Bug’s Life won the box office war.

00:01:31.189 --> 00:01:32.900
Deep Impact and Armageddon

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:37.460
Hollywood loves to blow things up, and worldwide
destruction is a staple of the action genre.

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:41.960
Still, the coincidences between Deep Impact
and Armageddon were too big to not notice.

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:46.700
Separated by just two months, they both feature
a large space object flying towards Earth,

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:50.700
with only a team of unexpected heroes able
to stop it before it’s too late. Though

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:55.100
Michael Bay’s Armageddon had more hype and
posted higher box office totals, many believe

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:58.759
Deep Impact to be the winner here. It was
felt to be the more emotional and sentimental

00:01:58.759 --> 00:02:02.420
of the two, while Armageddon was thought to
be just brainless fun.

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:04.829
Ed TV and The Truman Show

00:02:04.829 --> 00:02:09.539
With today’s society obsessed with reality
TV and insta-celebrity culture, The Truman

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:13.300
Show seemed awfully prophetic when it was
released in 1998. But maybe that’s because

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:18.110
it executed its premise better than the similar
Ed TV, which came out in 1999. Both explored

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:22.090
the oddity of having cameras record your everyday
life for the world and the toll that takes

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:26.569
on its subjects, but Truman Show was a bona
fide Oscar contender and rode Jim Carrey’s

00:02:26.569 --> 00:02:30.989
popularity to box office gold. Ed TV was a
commercial dud and received mixed reviews,

00:02:30.989 --> 00:02:34.569
making it an afterthought before its run was
over.

00:02:34.569 --> 00:02:36.840
The Prestige and The Illusionist

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:40.790
Everyone loves the magic of movies, but what
about movies about magic?

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:45.160
Hollywood double-dipped in this genre in 2006,
when The Prestige and The Illusionist came

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:50.129
out. Both were period pieces that dealt with
supernatural magic in deadly magician rivalries.

00:02:50.129 --> 00:02:53.690
It’s hard to say which one was the true
winner here, as each one received positive

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:57.830
reviews and scored modest box office success
and were even nominated for the same Academy

00:02:57.830 --> 00:03:02.409
Award. If anything, The Prestige has the upper
hand, as director Christopher Nolan’s touch

00:03:02.409 --> 00:03:05.870
and the star-studded cast instantly grabbed
the viewer and gave them something they’ll

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:09.150
never forget. We’re always watching closely.

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:11.560
Saving Private Ryan and The Thin Red Line

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:16.080
In 1998, Steven Spielberg’s Saving Private
Ryan was one of the defining films of the

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:20.790
year and captivated audiences with its heart-wrenching
story and realistic portrayal of World War

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:25.629
II. The epic dealt with the bravery soldiers
had to complete their mission – no matter

00:03:25.629 --> 00:03:29.730
how foolish it seemed on paper. After Ryan
made a fortune at the box office and scored

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:34.549
11 Oscar nods, The Thin Red Line had to be
seen as a poor imitation by comparison. Though

00:03:34.549 --> 00:03:40.099
it was no slouch, the other WWII film featured
similar themes and setup, causing moviegoers

00:03:40.099 --> 00:03:43.980
to gloss over it when it was released in January
1999.

00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:46.549
No Strings Attached and Friends With Benefits

00:03:46.549 --> 00:03:51.150
With rare exceptions, rom-coms typically follow
the same formula and can come across as clichéd.

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:55.299
That’s exactly how moviegoers felt when
No Strings Attached and Friends With Benefits

00:03:55.299 --> 00:03:58.700
were released just months apart from each
other. The premise of both is so similar;

00:03:58.700 --> 00:04:02.220
it’s hard for even the most devout movie
follower to keep them straight. It doesn’t

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:05.909
help that the two were seen as middling offerings
that failed to bring anything new to the genre,

00:04:05.909 --> 00:04:10.650
making it difficult for either one to truly
stand out. Still, with their charming leads,

00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:12.730
the two films make a harmless choice for date
night.

00:04:12.730 --> 00:04:15.930
Mirror, Mirror and Snow White and the Huntsman

00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:19.829
When something as recognizable as Snow White
is in the public domain, you can bet that

00:04:19.829 --> 00:04:24.360
studios will be scrambling to get their own
adaptation out. In 2012, Hollywood treated

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:28.180
us to Mirror, Mirror and Snow White and the
Huntsman, both using the classic fairy tale

00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:32.199
as inspiration. Fortunately, the differences
largely stopped there. Mirror, Mirror was

00:04:32.199 --> 00:04:36.139
a more light-hearted family friendly affair,
while Huntsman strayed towards the darker

00:04:36.139 --> 00:04:40.410
blockbuster template for older fantasy fans.
The only problem is that neither one completely

00:04:40.410 --> 00:04:44.620
pulled off the trick, so fans will still have
to settle for Disney’s famous animated version.

00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:46.280
Not that we’re complaining.

00:04:46.280 --> 00:04:48.669
The Legend of Hercules and Hercules

00:04:48.669 --> 00:04:52.800
Once again, Hollywood tried the same thing
twice in the same year and the results were

00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:57.380
hardly impressive. Two films based on the
Hercules mythology came out in 2014, and neither

00:04:57.380 --> 00:05:01.669
one blew audiences away. If there’s a winner,
it is Hercules, which gave the well-known

00:05:01.669 --> 00:05:05.850
story enough narrative twists to keep audiences
guessing. Legend of Hercules was a straightforward

00:05:05.850 --> 00:05:09.350
origins picture while skipping over elements
that may have made it more interesting. Plus,

00:05:09.350 --> 00:05:13.830
it’s hard to go wrong with the Rock in an
action role, regardless of what it is. He

00:05:13.830 --> 00:05:16.800
oozes charisma, especially when compared to
Kellan Lutz.

00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:19.639
Dante’s Peak and Volcano

00:05:19.639 --> 00:05:23.720
There are too many similarities between these
two volcano movies to list. They both feature

00:05:23.720 --> 00:05:27.830
experienced, but troubled heroes tasked with
saving their loved ones before a volcanic

00:05:27.830 --> 00:05:32.729
eruption destroys their home city. They even
end the same way, with the volcano being deemed

00:05:32.729 --> 00:05:36.789
an on-going threat. It’s a shame that neither
one was able to pull off that exciting premise,

00:05:36.789 --> 00:05:41.789
as the two films suffered identical fates
of being critically panned, box office flops.

00:05:41.789 --> 00:05:46.539
Dante’s Peak at least offered the intriguing
pairing of Pierce Brosnan and Linda Hamilton,

00:05:46.539 --> 00:05:48.770
so there’s that if you’re stuck on which
one to watch.

00:05:48.770 --> 00:05:53.139
Those are our picks for instances where two
studios made the same film. Are there any

00:05:53.139 --> 00:05:54.139
we missed?
