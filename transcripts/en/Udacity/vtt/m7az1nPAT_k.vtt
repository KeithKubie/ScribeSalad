00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:02.542
To do real tracking,
we have to specify these things.

00:00:02.542 --> 00:00:07.580
In particular, we've got state and state
dynamics and we've got a sensor model.

00:00:07.580 --> 00:00:09.000
So in the math, it's easy.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.820
We just write x and
we say, x is the state.

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:12.958
But the state of what?

00:00:12.958 --> 00:00:14.810
Montana, what, Missouri, you know, what?

00:00:14.810 --> 00:00:15.542
No.

00:00:15.542 --> 00:00:16.510
Is state of the object.

00:00:16.510 --> 00:00:17.792
Everybody says, oh,
it's state of the object?

00:00:17.792 --> 00:00:18.875
Well, what does that mean?

00:00:18.875 --> 00:00:21.480
It's obviously some
representation of the object.

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:23.125
Its position, its velocity.

00:00:23.125 --> 00:00:26.780
Maybe something about whether it's happy
or sad and that sounds like a joke.

00:00:26.780 --> 00:00:29.942
But actually, if you can think about
tracking the state of the object,

00:00:29.942 --> 00:00:32.958
there's no requirement that the state
be a purely physical thing.

00:00:32.958 --> 00:00:37.116
It's anything that can have an influence
on a sensor measurement that you want

00:00:37.116 --> 00:00:38.570
to know.

00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:41.500
Speaking of sensor measurements or
speaking of z.

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:43.850
That's the measurement, but
the measurement of what?

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:45.623
What measurement are you
going to use and

00:00:45.623 --> 00:00:47.792
how does the measurement
relate to the state?

00:00:47.792 --> 00:00:50.930
So, if we're going to do real tracking
we have to know these things.

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:53.417
And finally,
where do you get your dynamics from?

00:00:53.417 --> 00:00:57.326
Do you go to the, the, the, the dynamics
shelf at Home Depot and say, I,

00:00:57.326 --> 00:00:59.092
l need some dynamics please?

00:00:59.092 --> 00:01:02.080
You know, where are you going to
get these for computer vision?

00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:06.550
The discussion we're going to use
today comes a bit from this paper and,

00:01:06.550 --> 00:01:09.549
and the idea of using particles and

00:01:09.549 --> 00:01:13.250
sample based representations
of densities, that wasn't new.

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:15.384
That was known in a variety
of mathematics and, and

00:01:15.384 --> 00:01:16.583
other engineering fields.

00:01:16.583 --> 00:01:20.030
But this is this is the paper that
really brought it to computer vision.
