00:00:00.315 --> 00:00:02.096
- [Voiceover] So we have
a f of x right over here

00:00:02.096 --> 00:00:04.860
and it's defined piecewise
for x less than zero,

00:00:04.860 --> 00:00:06.358
f of x is x plus one,

00:00:06.358 --> 00:00:08.535
for x is greater than or equal to zero,

00:00:08.535 --> 00:00:10.936
f of x is cosine of pi x.

00:00:10.936 --> 00:00:12.664
And we want to evaluate
the definite integral

00:00:12.664 --> 00:00:15.564
from negative one to one of f of x dx.

00:00:15.564 --> 00:00:16.397
And you might immediately say,

00:00:16.397 --> 00:00:19.647
well, which of these versions of f of x

00:00:20.598 --> 00:00:22.851
am I going to take the
antiderivative from,

00:00:22.851 --> 00:00:24.866
because from negative one to zero,

00:00:24.866 --> 00:00:27.213
I would think about x plus one,

00:00:27.213 --> 00:00:28.190
but then from zero to one

00:00:28.190 --> 00:00:30.747
I would think about cosine pi x.

00:00:30.747 --> 00:00:31.751
And if you were thinking that,

00:00:31.751 --> 00:00:33.205
you're thinking in the right direction.

00:00:33.205 --> 00:00:35.125
And the way that we can make this

00:00:35.125 --> 00:00:36.177
a little bit more straightforward

00:00:36.177 --> 00:00:38.866
is to actually split up
this definite integral.

00:00:38.866 --> 00:00:40.481
This is going to be equal
to the definite integral

00:00:40.481 --> 00:00:42.564
from negative one to zero

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:44.780
of f of x dx

00:00:48.492 --> 00:00:49.740
plus the integral

00:00:49.740 --> 00:00:51.400
from zero to one

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:52.733
of f of x dx.

00:00:53.797 --> 00:00:56.320
Now why was it useful for
me to split it up this way,

00:00:56.320 --> 00:00:58.413
in particular to split the integral

00:00:58.413 --> 00:00:59.658
from negative one to one,

00:00:59.658 --> 00:01:01.908
split it into two intervals
from negative one to zero,

00:01:01.908 --> 00:01:03.295
and zero to one?

00:01:03.295 --> 00:01:05.605
Well, I did that because x equals zero

00:01:05.605 --> 00:01:06.438
is where we switch,

00:01:06.438 --> 00:01:08.406
where f of x switches
from being x plus one

00:01:08.406 --> 00:01:09.656
to cosine pi x.

00:01:10.626 --> 00:01:13.490
So if you look at the interval
from negative one to zero,

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:15.776
f of x is x plus one.

00:01:15.776 --> 00:01:19.415
So f of x here is x plus one.

00:01:19.415 --> 00:01:21.280
And then when you go from zero to one,

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:23.363
f of x is cosine pi x.

00:01:24.402 --> 00:01:25.902
So cosine of pi x.

00:01:28.802 --> 00:01:31.576
And so now we just have to
evaluate each of these separately

00:01:31.576 --> 00:01:33.461
and add them together.

00:01:33.461 --> 00:01:36.365
So let's take the definite
integral from negative one

00:01:36.365 --> 00:01:38.698
to zero of x plus one dx.

00:01:41.093 --> 00:01:41.926
Well, let's see.

00:01:41.926 --> 00:01:44.512
The antiderivative x plus one is...

00:01:44.512 --> 00:01:48.455
antiderivative x is x squared over two.

00:01:48.455 --> 00:01:50.393
I'm just incrementing the exponent

00:01:50.393 --> 00:01:52.121
and then dividing by that value.

00:01:52.121 --> 00:01:53.999
And then plus x,

00:01:53.999 --> 00:01:55.768
and you could view it as
I'm doing the same thing.

00:01:55.768 --> 00:01:58.208
If this is x to the zero,
it'll be x to the first,

00:01:58.208 --> 00:02:00.018
x to the first over one,

00:02:00.018 --> 00:02:01.351
which is just x.

00:02:02.309 --> 00:02:05.219
And I'm gonna evaluate that at zero

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:06.108
and subtract from that,

00:02:06.108 --> 00:02:07.581
it evaluated at one.

00:02:07.581 --> 00:02:09.667
Sorry, it evaluated at negative one.

00:02:09.667 --> 00:02:11.741
And so this is going to be equal to...

00:02:11.741 --> 00:02:13.824
If I evaluate it at zero,

00:02:14.866 --> 00:02:16.634
let me do this in another color.

00:02:16.634 --> 00:02:18.118
If I evaluate it at zero,

00:02:18.118 --> 00:02:21.501
it's going to be zero squared over two,

00:02:21.501 --> 00:02:22.992
which is, well, I'll just write it.

00:02:22.992 --> 00:02:26.136
Zero squared over two plus zero.

00:02:26.136 --> 00:02:30.136
Well, all of that's just
gonna be equal to zero.

00:02:31.817 --> 00:02:34.471
It evaluated at negative one.

00:02:34.471 --> 00:02:37.608
So minus negative one squared.

00:02:37.608 --> 00:02:41.719
Negative one squared over
two plus negative one.

00:02:41.719 --> 00:02:44.549
So negative one squared is just one.

00:02:44.549 --> 00:02:48.527
So it's 1/2 plus negative one.

00:02:48.527 --> 00:02:51.277
1/2 plus negative one,

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:53.727
or 1/2 minus one,

00:02:53.727 --> 00:02:54.742
is negative 1/2.

00:02:54.742 --> 00:02:56.960
So all of that is negative 1/2.

00:02:56.960 --> 00:02:58.607
But then we're subtracting negative 1/2.

00:02:58.607 --> 00:03:00.828
Zero minus negative 1/2

00:03:00.828 --> 00:03:03.613
is going to be equal to positive 1/2.

00:03:03.613 --> 00:03:08.211
So this is going to be
equal to positive 1/2.

00:03:08.211 --> 00:03:10.364
So this first part right over here

00:03:10.364 --> 00:03:13.305
is positive 1/2.

00:03:13.305 --> 00:03:15.910
And now let's evaluate the integral

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:18.410
from zero to one of cosine pi,

00:03:21.099 --> 00:03:22.731
I don't need that first parentheses,

00:03:22.731 --> 00:03:24.731
of cosine of pi x dx.

00:03:27.967 --> 00:03:29.774
What is this equal to?

00:03:29.774 --> 00:03:31.190
Now, if we were just trying to find

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:33.092
the antiderivative of cosine of x,

00:03:33.092 --> 00:03:34.109
it's pretty straightforward.

00:03:34.109 --> 00:03:36.593
We know that the derivative
with respect to x

00:03:36.593 --> 00:03:38.184
of sine of x

00:03:38.184 --> 00:03:40.184
is equal to cosine of x.

00:03:44.104 --> 00:03:45.128
But that's not what we have here,

00:03:45.128 --> 00:03:47.490
we have cosine of pi x.

00:03:47.490 --> 00:03:49.297
So there is a technique here,

00:03:49.297 --> 00:03:50.675
you can call it u-substitution.

00:03:50.675 --> 00:03:52.131
You can say u is equal to pi x.

00:03:52.131 --> 00:03:52.964
If you don't know how to do that,

00:03:52.964 --> 00:03:55.319
you can still try to think this through,

00:03:55.319 --> 00:03:56.603
where we could say, alright,

00:03:56.603 --> 00:04:00.314
well, maybe it involves
sine of pi x somehow.

00:04:00.314 --> 00:04:02.308
So the derivative with respect to x

00:04:02.308 --> 00:04:03.558
of sine of pi x

00:04:06.025 --> 00:04:07.329
would be what?

00:04:07.329 --> 00:04:08.764
Well, we would use the chain rule.

00:04:08.764 --> 00:04:10.363
It would be the derivative
of the outside function

00:04:10.363 --> 00:04:12.187
with respect to the inside

00:04:12.187 --> 00:04:14.455
or sine of pi x with respect to pi x,

00:04:14.455 --> 00:04:16.955
which would be cosine of pi x,

00:04:18.085 --> 00:04:20.643
and then times the derivative
of the inside function

00:04:20.643 --> 00:04:22.142
with respect to x.

00:04:22.142 --> 00:04:24.377
So it would be times pi.

00:04:24.377 --> 00:04:26.493
Or you could say the
derivative of sine pi x

00:04:26.493 --> 00:04:28.243
is pi cosine of pi x.

00:04:30.465 --> 00:04:32.320
Now, we almost have that here,

00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:34.418
except we just need a pi.

00:04:34.418 --> 00:04:36.235
So what if we were to
throw a pi right over here,

00:04:36.235 --> 00:04:37.424
but so we don't change the value

00:04:37.424 --> 00:04:39.745
we also multiply by one over pi?

00:04:39.745 --> 00:04:42.474
So if you divide and
multiply by the same number,

00:04:42.474 --> 00:04:44.577
you're not changing its value.

00:04:44.577 --> 00:04:46.947
One over pi times pi is just equal to one.

00:04:46.947 --> 00:04:48.998
But this is useful.

00:04:48.998 --> 00:04:53.165
This is useful because we
now know that pi cosine pi x

00:04:54.374 --> 00:04:56.773
is the derivative of sine pi x.

00:04:56.773 --> 00:04:58.945
So this is all going to be equal to...

00:04:58.945 --> 00:05:00.695
This is equal to one.

00:05:01.947 --> 00:05:03.874
Let me take that one over pi.

00:05:03.874 --> 00:05:06.404
So this is equal to one over pi

00:05:06.404 --> 00:05:07.237
times...

00:05:08.332 --> 00:05:10.080
Now we're going to evaluate.

00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:11.747
So the antiderivative here we just said

00:05:11.747 --> 00:05:13.080
is sine of pi x,

00:05:17.972 --> 00:05:22.139
and we're going to evaluate
that at one and at zero.

00:05:23.553 --> 00:05:27.900
So this is going to be
equal to one over pi.

00:05:27.900 --> 00:05:29.831
One over pi, not pi.

00:05:29.831 --> 00:05:31.819
My hand is not listening to my mouth.

00:05:31.819 --> 00:05:34.152
One over pi times sine of pi

00:05:41.921 --> 00:05:46.428
minus sine of pi times
zero, which is just zero.

00:05:46.428 --> 00:05:49.379
Well, sine of pi, that's zero.

00:05:49.379 --> 00:05:51.431
Sine of zero is zero.

00:05:51.431 --> 00:05:52.447
So you're gonna have one over pi

00:05:52.447 --> 00:05:53.917
times zero minus zero.

00:05:53.917 --> 00:05:56.869
So this whole thing is just
all going to be equal to zero.

00:05:56.869 --> 00:05:59.278
So this first part was 1/2,

00:05:59.278 --> 00:06:02.563
this second part right
over here is equal to zero,

00:06:02.563 --> 00:06:05.953
so the whole definite integral
is gonna be 1/2 plus zero,

00:06:05.953 --> 00:06:08.797
which is equal to 1/2.

00:06:08.797 --> 00:06:12.862
So all of that together is equal to 1/2.
