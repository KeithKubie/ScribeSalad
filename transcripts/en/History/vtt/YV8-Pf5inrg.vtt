00:00:01.376 --> 00:00:03.169
- Bladesmiths, this

00:00:03.169 --> 00:00:05.171
The wooden ramrod chop.

00:00:05.171 --> 00:00:07.298
To test the strength and
durability of your edge,

00:00:07.298 --> 00:00:09.509
as well as the overall
construction of your knives,

00:00:09.509 --> 00:00:12.929
I'll be chopping into
this ramrod 10 times.

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:14.681
Bob, you're up first, you ready?

00:00:14.681 --> 00:00:15.557
No, but let's do it.

00:00:15.557 --> 00:00:18.727
BEN ABBOTT: All right.

00:00:18.727 --> 00:00:19.978
BOB: Naturally I'm nervous.

00:00:19.978 --> 00:00:21.604
My concern on the
wooden ramrod chop

00:00:21.604 --> 00:00:24.649
is that the edge rolls or
maybe the blade breaks.

00:00:24.649 --> 00:00:26.276
Steel is a finicky
little critter.

00:00:26.276 --> 00:00:28.236
Sometimes it works
real good, sometimes

00:00:28.236 --> 00:00:29.988
it just snaps in your face.

00:00:29.988 --> 00:00:34.117
You'll never know
until you test it.

00:00:34.117 --> 00:00:37.912
[chops ramrod] [music playing]

00:00:37.912 --> 00:00:40.957
There she goes.

00:00:40.957 --> 00:00:43.668
Feel like a punch in the gut.

00:00:43.668 --> 00:00:45.712
BEN ABBOTT: Well, Bob, quite
obviously your plane broke.

00:00:45.712 --> 00:00:46.963
Whoops.

00:00:46.963 --> 00:00:48.298
BEN ABBOTT: And
looking at your grain,

00:00:48.298 --> 00:00:49.966
I would like to have
seen thermal cycling

00:00:49.966 --> 00:00:51.217
done to your blade.

00:00:51.217 --> 00:00:52.677
The grain that
I'm seeing in here

00:00:52.677 --> 00:00:54.679
is a lot more coarse
than I would like to see.

00:00:54.679 --> 00:00:56.848
And that blends to a
more brittle blade.

00:00:59.809 --> 00:01:01.060
WIL WILLIS: Bob,
your blade suffered

00:01:01.060 --> 00:01:02.812
a critical failure
in the very first

00:01:02.812 --> 00:01:05.023
strike of the very first test.

00:01:05.023 --> 00:01:09.152
However, in order to proceed,
two more bladesmith's still

00:01:09.152 --> 00:01:10.570
have to make it
through this test.

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:12.781
Bob, you're not out yet.

00:01:12.781 --> 00:01:17.035
Gentlemen, your blades are made
out of the exact same steel.

00:01:17.035 --> 00:01:18.745
Let's see if they hold up.

00:01:18.745 --> 00:01:19.996
Ben?

00:01:19.996 --> 00:01:21.289
BEN ABBOTT: Daniel,
you're up next.

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:22.999
Feeling lucky?
- I reckon so.

00:01:22.999 --> 00:01:23.917
BEN ABBOTT: All right.

00:01:23.917 --> 00:01:27.045
[music playing]

00:01:28.546 --> 00:01:31.007
DANIEL: Everything about
the steel in my blade

00:01:31.007 --> 00:01:33.468
and in Bob's blade is identical.

00:01:33.468 --> 00:01:36.971
The thing that scares me right
now is if I got this thing too

00:01:36.971 --> 00:01:39.349
hard, the first time he
hits that ramrod it's

00:01:39.349 --> 00:01:41.518
going to shatter like glass.
[chops ramrod]

00:01:41.518 --> 00:01:44.854
[music playing]

00:01:56.991 --> 00:01:58.868
BEN ABBOTT: Well, Daniel,
it held up very well.

00:01:58.868 --> 00:02:01.454
The edge is just not quite
as sharp as it was before.

00:02:01.454 --> 00:02:03.581
But there's no rolls,
there's no chipping.

00:02:03.581 --> 00:02:04.958
This was impressive
to watch you do.

00:02:04.958 --> 00:02:06.334
This is your second blade.

00:02:06.334 --> 00:02:07.210
DANIEL: Thank you sir.
- Collin, you're up.

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:07.919
You ready?

00:02:07.919 --> 00:02:09.212
I'm jealous.

00:02:09.212 --> 00:02:09.963
I want to swing it.

00:02:13.925 --> 00:02:17.345
And I'm just like, oh.

00:02:17.345 --> 00:02:19.639
[beep] You can't look away.

00:02:19.639 --> 00:02:20.807
It's like a car wreck.

00:02:20.807 --> 00:02:25.311
You just lock in.
[chops ramrod]

00:02:25.311 --> 00:02:28.606
[music playing]

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:37.740
[beep] Well, we're
in the same camp now.

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:41.077
[slow intense music playing]

00:02:44.163 --> 00:02:47.667
BEN ABBOTT: Well Collin,
your knife broke, obviously.

00:02:47.667 --> 00:02:50.253
The grain structure in
here is sort of in between.

00:02:50.253 --> 00:02:51.880
It's not quite as
coarse as I've seen,

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:54.591
but it's certainly not the
finest grain I've ever seen.

00:02:54.591 --> 00:02:56.342
The thing that's
really telling is

00:02:56.342 --> 00:02:58.761
there was a Mig weld that went
across here to hold this piece

00:02:58.761 --> 00:03:00.430
of mild steel on the side.

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:03.141
Right next to it there is this
bronze line, and what that

00:03:03.141 --> 00:03:05.101
tells me is that that
was a surface crack

00:03:05.101 --> 00:03:07.312
there before the heat treat.

00:03:07.312 --> 00:03:08.897
That's why it broke,
where it broke.

00:03:13.985 --> 00:03:16.070
WIL WILLIS: Daniel, you'll be
moving on to the final round.

00:03:16.070 --> 00:03:17.947
Congratulations.

00:03:17.947 --> 00:03:22.660
Collin, Bob, both of your blades
suffered catastrophic failures

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:24.120
in our strength test.

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:26.789
Collin, your blade
lasted longer than Bob.

00:03:26.789 --> 00:03:30.251
Bob, your blade suffered
that catastrophic failure

00:03:30.251 --> 00:03:31.502
in one stroke.

00:03:31.502 --> 00:03:33.171
And for that reason
I have to ask

00:03:33.171 --> 00:03:34.297
you to please leave the forge.

00:03:34.297 --> 00:03:37.884
[music playing]

00:03:37.884 --> 00:03:40.345
BOB: If you've never broken
a blade as a bladesmith,

00:03:40.345 --> 00:03:42.347
you have a bladesmith.

00:03:42.347 --> 00:03:43.556
I have no regrets.

00:03:43.556 --> 00:03:44.599
This is merely a
stumbling block when

00:03:44.599 --> 00:03:46.184
you're walking down the street.

00:03:46.184 --> 00:03:48.061
You get up, you dust yourself
off, and you move on.

00:03:48.061 --> 00:03:49.854
I came here to prove
that I can make

00:03:49.854 --> 00:03:52.523
a knife under strenuous
conditions in three hours.

00:03:52.523 --> 00:03:54.025
I did that.

00:03:54.025 --> 00:03:54.859
Win or lose.

00:03:54.859 --> 00:03:55.860
I did it.
