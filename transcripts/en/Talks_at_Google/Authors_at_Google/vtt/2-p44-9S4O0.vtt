JASON SANDERS: Without any
further ado, John Cleese.

00:00:08.359 --> 00:00:10.150
JOHN CLEESE: I'm going
to sit on that side.

00:00:10.150 --> 00:00:10.983
JASON SANDERS: Yeah.

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:17.160
JOHN CLEESE: The awful
thing about getting old

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:20.200
is that I have to say to Jason
I want to sit on this side

00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:24.090
because this is my good ear.

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:26.790
Sad, isn't it?

00:00:26.790 --> 00:00:28.840
It's not so bad getting old.

00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:29.845
It's not so bad.

00:00:29.845 --> 00:00:31.250
JASON SANDERS: Well,
beats the alternative.

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:32.833
JOHN CLEESE: It beats
the alternative.

00:00:32.833 --> 00:00:38.110
But also as you get older you
realize that as somebody once

00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:40.935
said to me-- it was a
general in the British Army--

00:00:40.935 --> 00:00:46.450
he said very little matters
much and most things

00:00:46.450 --> 00:00:48.070
don't matter at all.

00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:50.280
And I think now
that that's sunk in,

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:53.370
I think it's hard when you're
younger to realize that very

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:55.994
little matters really.

00:00:55.994 --> 00:00:59.630
And that's why I can look at
the current political scene here

00:00:59.630 --> 00:01:04.519
and in the rest of the world
and have a good giggle about it.

00:01:04.519 --> 00:01:08.290
I suppose the alternative
is bursting into tears.

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:11.080
Now, Jason, your name
is an anagram of Sonja.

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:13.720
Did you know that?

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:17.655
JASON SANDERS: I think that's
where my parents got it from.

00:01:17.655 --> 00:01:22.240
Yes, that's what they
tell me, I think.

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:24.470
You often get
philosophical about life

00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:27.645
and I was going to ask you
what does it all means?

00:01:27.645 --> 00:01:28.716
JOHN CLEESE: Oh.

00:01:28.716 --> 00:01:30.090
JASON SANDERS:
You made a movie--

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:31.040
JOHN CLEESE: Yeah,
I made a movie--

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:33.540
JASON SANDERS: --if you recall
called "The Meaning of Life."

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:36.080
It sounds maybe like you've
revised some of those theories

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:36.580
since then.

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:39.650
JOHN CLEESE: I remember doing an
interview on Danish television

00:01:39.650 --> 00:01:42.640
once live-- course they
speak perfect English.

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:48.376
And one of them
said to me, well,

00:01:48.376 --> 00:01:49.500
what's the meaning of life?

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:51.041
And I say it's really
interesting you

00:01:51.041 --> 00:01:53.040
should ask that because
I actually realized it

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:55.360
this morning.

00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:56.130
And he said, what?

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:58.177
And I said, yes, it was
just after breakfast.

00:01:58.177 --> 00:01:59.885
I had this moment of
absolute revelation.

00:01:59.885 --> 00:02:01.100
He said, well, can you tell us?

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:02.641
And I said no, I've
forgotten it now.

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:10.150
He really believed me.

00:02:10.150 --> 00:02:13.160
I think the main thing is
to understand that happiness

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:15.690
or adjustment is much
more an emotional state

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:19.070
than an intellectual
state, and I

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:21.480
think that any kind
of practice that's

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:27.780
vaguely meditation or even--
not as effective, but still--

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:28.720
therapy.

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:34.380
I think the more that we
have a disrespectful attitude

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:38.730
towards our own egos, I think
the happier life becomes.

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:41.070
And I think the great
problem of growing up

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:43.050
at the moment, particularly
for young people,

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:45.930
is that you're told that if
you're not rich and famous,

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:47.860
your life is not
really worthwhile.

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:52.920
And that is such
pernicious crap.

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:54.670
JASON SANDERS: So I
think it's interesting

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:57.960
that you find introspection
and meditation so important

00:02:57.960 --> 00:03:00.330
because you've made your
name and career partly

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:02.320
for performance.

00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:04.740
And so how do you think show
business and performance fits

00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:05.680
into all of this?

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:07.138
JOHN CLEESE: Well,
I think that you

00:03:07.138 --> 00:03:09.550
can be-- somebody
once said to me,

00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:12.100
you can be an introverted
exhibitionist.

00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:14.080
I think there's truth in that.

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:19.270
But I think on the whole, very
few people are purely extrovert

00:03:19.270 --> 00:03:20.630
or purely introvert.

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:26.570
The American society is
much more extroverted

00:03:26.570 --> 00:03:28.510
and I don't think Americans
are aware of that.

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:32.550
There is an absolutely
fabulous book called "Quiet,"

00:03:32.550 --> 00:03:33.940
completely white cover.

00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:38.100
It's written by a woman
called Susan Cain, C-A-I-N,

00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:40.940
and it's called "Quiet," and
it's about being an introvert.

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:44.180
And I read that three years ago
and it was very helpful to me

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:46.880
because in an
extroverted society

00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:50.090
you can start feeling that
there's something a bit

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:52.960
wrong with you if
you're an introvert.

00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:54.220
I don't believe that at all.

00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:56.410
I think if you sat down
with Jesus and the Buddha

00:03:56.410 --> 00:03:59.090
you'd find that they
were both introverts.

00:03:59.090 --> 00:04:04.060
And extroverted values which
are to do with fame and money

00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:06.280
and status and positions--
these are all things

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:07.637
you have no control over.

00:04:07.637 --> 00:04:08.595
Do you see what I mean?

00:04:08.595 --> 00:04:10.840
Whereas you have a certain
amount of control over

00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:13.020
your inner life because
you can somehow--

00:04:13.020 --> 00:04:15.040
you cannot control
your thoughts,

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:19.260
but you can decide how much
energy to give to a specific

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:20.515
thought.

00:04:20.515 --> 00:04:21.605
So that's a bit profound.

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:27.146
JASON SANDERS: This is
exactly how I saw this going.

00:04:27.146 --> 00:04:28.020
JOHN CLEESE: Oh dear.

00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:30.210
Is that a bad thing?

00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:31.640
Sonja, come on.

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:40.810
JASON SANDERS: So
how early can you

00:04:40.810 --> 00:04:43.300
trace back this sort
of philosophy on life?

00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:44.062
And I know that--

00:04:44.062 --> 00:04:45.020
JOHN CLEESE: Which bit?

00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:49.400
JASON SANDERS: Well, the quiet
stillness, the introversion.

00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:54.360
I know that you did-- I'll say
your experiences in childhood

00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:55.582
would not necessarily--

00:04:55.582 --> 00:04:57.290
JOHN CLEESE: Oh, no,
I was not gregarious

00:04:57.290 --> 00:05:00.190
at all because my parents
were older parents.

00:05:00.190 --> 00:05:03.150
Dad was 46 when I was
born and Mum was 40,

00:05:03.150 --> 00:05:06.340
and that was a lot
in 1939, you know.

00:05:06.340 --> 00:05:08.450
And we moved continuously.

00:05:08.450 --> 00:05:13.940
I mean, during the war we
were bombed just a few months

00:05:13.940 --> 00:05:16.510
after I was born,
and my father who

00:05:16.510 --> 00:05:19.970
had fought the First World War
was out of there like a shot.

00:05:19.970 --> 00:05:22.350
Some people say, well, what
are you running away for?

00:05:22.350 --> 00:05:24.725
And he said, well, if you're
going to run away then do it

00:05:24.725 --> 00:05:26.274
quickly, don't do it--

00:05:26.274 --> 00:05:28.810
And we went and I
started life on a farm,

00:05:28.810 --> 00:05:31.960
and we moved house 13 times
in 14 years or something

00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:34.290
ridiculous, so I
didn't have a chance

00:05:34.290 --> 00:05:36.454
to make very close
friendships with friends

00:05:36.454 --> 00:05:38.620
because the moment I got
to know someone, we'd move.

00:05:38.620 --> 00:05:41.980
And when I went to school I
didn't fit in very well but I'd

00:05:41.980 --> 00:05:45.190
spent a lot of my
life amusing myself,

00:05:45.190 --> 00:05:49.450
playing little games on my
own with my stuffed animals,

00:05:49.450 --> 00:05:49.950
you know?

00:05:49.950 --> 00:05:53.270
And Sammy Davis Jr.
once said that he

00:05:53.270 --> 00:05:58.660
thought boredom was a
great help to creativity

00:05:58.660 --> 00:06:00.950
because when you
start getting bored

00:06:00.950 --> 00:06:04.440
without a constant external
stimulation, that's

00:06:04.440 --> 00:06:08.160
when stuff starts coming up
from the inside, which is really

00:06:08.160 --> 00:06:09.920
what creativity is about.

00:06:09.920 --> 00:06:11.460
I'm very interested
in creativity

00:06:11.460 --> 00:06:15.210
because no one ever spotted
I had any until I was 22.

00:06:15.210 --> 00:06:17.190
And when I think
back, I think, well,

00:06:17.190 --> 00:06:20.412
that was a big comment on the
educational system in Britain

00:06:20.412 --> 00:06:22.120
at the time because
I remember being told

00:06:22.120 --> 00:06:24.220
to write an essay on the time.

00:06:24.220 --> 00:06:27.670
And it was quite a long
essay and I wrote it

00:06:27.670 --> 00:06:31.624
about how I didn't have
time to write the essay.

00:06:31.624 --> 00:06:32.540
You see what you mean?

00:06:32.540 --> 00:06:35.530
It's quite neat
for a 17-year-old.

00:06:35.530 --> 00:06:38.230
But nobody ever said, oh, you
have ability in is this area,

00:06:38.230 --> 00:06:41.070
so when I started to
discover at Cambridge

00:06:41.070 --> 00:06:43.870
I could write stuff
that made people laugh,

00:06:43.870 --> 00:06:45.950
then I began to
watch the process

00:06:45.950 --> 00:06:47.750
and I'm quite
convinced that anything

00:06:47.750 --> 00:06:52.410
of importance creatively
comes up from the unconscious.

00:06:52.410 --> 00:06:54.330
There's a lot of
very, very bright,

00:06:54.330 --> 00:06:57.900
highly intellectual,
immensely smart people,

00:06:57.900 --> 00:07:00.000
but they're left-brained.

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:04.960
And they'll never-- I
think-- be very creative.

00:07:04.960 --> 00:07:07.400
And Albert Einstein said the
most extraordinary things,

00:07:07.400 --> 00:07:11.460
like he said that muscular
feelings were a major part

00:07:11.460 --> 00:07:12.505
of his creative process.

00:07:12.505 --> 00:07:15.090
I mean, that surprises people.

00:07:15.090 --> 00:07:18.140
But when your unconscious
gives you an idea

00:07:18.140 --> 00:07:20.640
it doesn't give it
neatly printed out

00:07:20.640 --> 00:07:21.830
on a piece of paper.

00:07:21.830 --> 00:07:25.020
It'll just give you an image
or a feeling or something,

00:07:25.020 --> 00:07:28.060
and if you can stay with
that and move around,

00:07:28.060 --> 00:07:30.190
eventually it'll make sense.

00:07:30.190 --> 00:07:34.850
Like a guy called Kekule
von Stradonitz who

00:07:34.850 --> 00:07:37.220
invented-- or discovered,
I mean-- the structure

00:07:37.220 --> 00:07:39.280
of the carbon atom.

00:07:39.280 --> 00:07:41.290
He had been working
on it for years

00:07:41.290 --> 00:07:43.880
and one day he was dosing
and looking into the fire.

00:07:43.880 --> 00:07:49.310
And as he was dosing like this
he started watching the flames

00:07:49.310 --> 00:07:53.852
and he had this little
image that they were snakes

00:07:53.852 --> 00:07:56.862
and that they were biting
their own tales, you see?

00:07:59.820 --> 00:08:00.430
Carbon atom.

00:08:03.070 --> 00:08:04.301
You see what I mean?

00:08:04.301 --> 00:08:07.598
[LAUGHTER]

00:08:07.598 --> 00:08:08.480
It's not a direct.

00:08:08.480 --> 00:08:11.240
Not it's a carbon atom,
you see what I mean?

00:08:11.240 --> 00:08:12.615
You just get an
image of a snake.

00:08:12.615 --> 00:08:15.092
So it's very indirect,
the information

00:08:15.092 --> 00:08:17.300
you get from your unconscious
because there's so much

00:08:17.300 --> 00:08:19.030
information down there.

00:08:19.030 --> 00:08:21.300
I mean, there was a very
interesting experiment

00:08:21.300 --> 00:08:26.700
and psychologists
showed a group of people

00:08:26.700 --> 00:08:29.467
some Chinese
ideograms-- characters--

00:08:29.467 --> 00:08:32.050
and they came back next week and
they said to the people, now,

00:08:32.050 --> 00:08:34.250
we're going to show you
some more-- some of the ones

00:08:34.250 --> 00:08:35.840
you saw last week, some are new.

00:08:35.840 --> 00:08:37.860
Will you tell us which
ones you saw last week?

00:08:37.860 --> 00:08:40.900
And they were
absolutely hopeless.

00:08:40.900 --> 00:08:42.050
Nobody could do it at all.

00:08:42.050 --> 00:08:44.640
It was exactly chance.

00:08:44.640 --> 00:08:46.340
And then they repeated
the experiment.

00:08:46.340 --> 00:08:50.590
The second time they said--
on the second showing-- we're

00:08:50.590 --> 00:08:53.910
going to show you
some more ideograms,

00:08:53.910 --> 00:08:57.610
will you tell us
which ones you like?

00:08:57.610 --> 00:09:00.170
And the ones they
liked were the ones

00:09:00.170 --> 00:09:03.020
they'd seen the week before.

00:09:03.020 --> 00:09:06.760
So the information was in
there, in the unconscious,

00:09:06.760 --> 00:09:11.730
but it couldn't be accessed
in a straightforward way.

00:09:11.730 --> 00:09:15.880
JASON SANDERS:
That's-- I think it--

00:09:15.880 --> 00:09:18.520
JOHN CLEESE: I want people to
know that because you guys are

00:09:18.520 --> 00:09:20.100
in a very creative
business and you

00:09:20.100 --> 00:09:24.200
have to learn how to contact
your unconscious and use it.

00:09:24.200 --> 00:09:25.840
And what I spend a
lot of time doing

00:09:25.840 --> 00:09:29.830
is teaching people that
you've got to be quiet.

00:09:29.830 --> 00:09:32.360
You can't have a creative
idea while you're

00:09:32.360 --> 00:09:34.440
rushing around, answering
your cell phone,

00:09:34.440 --> 00:09:36.640
looking at your watch,
sending off email.

00:09:36.640 --> 00:09:38.090
It's not going to happen.

00:09:38.090 --> 00:09:39.330
You've got to get quieter.

00:09:39.330 --> 00:09:43.060
And Edison-- who I
think has more patience

00:09:43.060 --> 00:09:45.280
than any other
American in history--

00:09:45.280 --> 00:09:46.910
he had an extraordinary
way of working.

00:09:46.910 --> 00:09:51.360
He would sit and he would
hold ball bearings in his hand

00:09:51.360 --> 00:09:54.980
and he would have a metal
plate down there, a metal bowl,

00:09:54.980 --> 00:09:56.660
because he thought
he got his best

00:09:56.660 --> 00:09:59.445
ideas in that sort of
hinterland between being awaken

00:09:59.445 --> 00:10:01.170
and actually being asleep.

00:10:01.170 --> 00:10:03.590
And, well, reason he did that
is that as he fell asleep

00:10:03.590 --> 00:10:06.695
he would drop the ball
bearings into the metal bowl

00:10:06.695 --> 00:10:09.470
and they would wake him up again
and he'd pick it up and go.

00:10:09.470 --> 00:10:12.400
And he liked to stay in
that very, very dreamy state

00:10:12.400 --> 00:10:15.439
because that's when he
got the most of his ideas.

00:10:15.439 --> 00:10:16.980
JASON SANDERS: The
reason I hesitated

00:10:16.980 --> 00:10:20.420
before is because I find it so
interesting the link you make

00:10:20.420 --> 00:10:22.480
between left brain
and right brain,

00:10:22.480 --> 00:10:25.120
because I know growing up you
were quite good at mathematics.

00:10:25.120 --> 00:10:26.820
JOHN CLEESE: Oh, I
was all left brain.

00:10:26.820 --> 00:10:28.120
I was completely left brain.

00:10:28.120 --> 00:10:29.200
I was good at maths.

00:10:29.200 --> 00:10:30.100
I was good at Latin.

00:10:30.100 --> 00:10:33.040
I got into Cambridge on
science and switched to law.

00:10:33.040 --> 00:10:35.880
You don't get any more
left brain than that.

00:10:35.880 --> 00:10:38.970
JASON SANDERS:
Right, and so what

00:10:38.970 --> 00:10:42.469
happened then that suddenly
you started doing this other--

00:10:42.469 --> 00:10:44.010
JOHN CLEESE: I just
discovered that I

00:10:44.010 --> 00:10:47.115
could write sketches
that made people laugh

00:10:47.115 --> 00:10:49.850
and I discovered
that at Cambridge.

00:10:49.850 --> 00:10:52.000
I mean, I knew I had
a facility for making

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:55.450
my classmates laugh--
that's when I discovered it.

00:10:55.450 --> 00:10:57.900
And then as I went on
and on and on and on--

00:11:00.750 --> 00:11:02.750
I was very lucky
because early on I

00:11:02.750 --> 00:11:05.180
met a professor of
psychology from Sussex

00:11:05.180 --> 00:11:07.850
called Brian [? Bateson. ?]
Brian told me

00:11:07.850 --> 00:11:10.690
that the best bit of research
that had ever been done

00:11:10.690 --> 00:11:16.970
was done in America at
Berkeley in the late '60s-- no,

00:11:16.970 --> 00:11:21.010
yes, the '60s-- by a guy called
MacKinnon who was fascinated

00:11:21.010 --> 00:11:25.030
by creativity in-- not
in creative people,

00:11:25.030 --> 00:11:29.496
so-called-- but in professions--
journalism, engineers.

00:11:29.496 --> 00:11:31.496
But he was particularly
interested in architects

00:11:31.496 --> 00:11:34.700
because architects have got
to be good at creativity

00:11:34.700 --> 00:11:37.760
but they've also got to be
good at the left brain stuff

00:11:37.760 --> 00:11:41.580
so that the buildings actually
stay up after they look nice,

00:11:41.580 --> 00:11:42.460
you see what I mean?

00:11:42.460 --> 00:11:45.667
And he went around
all the architects

00:11:45.667 --> 00:11:47.125
and said who are
the creative ones?

00:11:47.125 --> 00:11:49.020
And he got a list of names.

00:11:49.020 --> 00:11:50.630
And then he went
and talked to them

00:11:50.630 --> 00:11:52.910
and said, what do you do
from the moment you get up

00:11:52.910 --> 00:11:55.700
in the morning to the moment
you go to bed at night?

00:11:55.700 --> 00:11:56.650
And they told him.

00:11:56.650 --> 00:12:00.960
And then he went off and asked
the uncreative architects.

00:12:00.960 --> 00:12:04.760
Of course, he didn't
tell them that that

00:12:04.760 --> 00:12:06.590
was why he was
asking them-- what

00:12:06.590 --> 00:12:10.050
do you do first thing
you get up, going to bed.

00:12:10.050 --> 00:12:12.780
And what he discovered, there
were two huge differences

00:12:12.780 --> 00:12:15.320
between the creative ones
and the uncreative ones.

00:12:15.320 --> 00:12:18.540
And the huge
differences were one,

00:12:18.540 --> 00:12:22.420
the creative architects
knew how to play.

00:12:22.420 --> 00:12:25.919
And he said the play
was almost childlike.

00:12:25.919 --> 00:12:28.460
Because when you see children
really absorbed into something,

00:12:28.460 --> 00:12:30.418
thinking, you know, what's
going to happen if I

00:12:30.418 --> 00:12:33.032
pull this wing off, you know?

00:12:33.032 --> 00:12:36.160
And if I pull this leg, what
would-- see what I mean?

00:12:36.160 --> 00:12:39.250
And there's no sense
of time, you know?

00:12:39.250 --> 00:12:40.280
It's sort of eternal.

00:12:40.280 --> 00:12:42.860
And they're completely
absorbed in it

00:12:42.860 --> 00:12:46.730
because they're interested
in it for its own sake,

00:12:46.730 --> 00:12:50.390
not because they have to
solve it in order to move on.

00:12:50.390 --> 00:12:51.920
And they had this
ability to play.

00:12:51.920 --> 00:12:54.086
And the other thing which
will probably surprise you

00:12:54.086 --> 00:12:56.710
is that they deferred
taking decisions

00:12:56.710 --> 00:12:58.610
as long as they could.

00:12:58.610 --> 00:13:01.660
And people are surprised
because the whole idea

00:13:01.660 --> 00:13:04.181
of the efficient executive
is someone who's like this.

00:13:04.181 --> 00:13:04.680
No.

00:13:04.680 --> 00:13:06.730
It's bullshit.

00:13:06.730 --> 00:13:08.742
When you have to
have take it or make

00:13:08.742 --> 00:13:09.950
a decision-- what do you say?

00:13:09.950 --> 00:13:11.245
You say take or make?

00:13:11.245 --> 00:13:11.580
JASON SANDERS: Make.

00:13:11.580 --> 00:13:12.330
JOHN CLEESE: Make.

00:13:12.330 --> 00:13:14.170
When you have to
make a decision,

00:13:14.170 --> 00:13:16.530
the first question you've
got to ask yourself

00:13:16.530 --> 00:13:21.070
is when does this question
have to be answered?

00:13:21.070 --> 00:13:24.840
And then you answer it then.

00:13:24.840 --> 00:13:27.370
But you don't answer it
before for two reasons.

00:13:27.370 --> 00:13:29.260
One is you may get
new information.

00:13:29.260 --> 00:13:30.510
Well, that's obvious.

00:13:30.510 --> 00:13:32.550
But the other is the
longer you leave it,

00:13:32.550 --> 00:13:34.975
the more chance
your unconscious has

00:13:34.975 --> 00:13:37.185
of coming up with some stuff.

00:13:37.185 --> 00:13:38.220
You see what I mean?

00:13:38.220 --> 00:13:39.053
JASON SANDERS: Yeah.

00:13:39.053 --> 00:13:41.030
JOHN CLEESE: So
it's take your time.

00:13:41.030 --> 00:13:42.510
But of course it's
the real world.

00:13:42.510 --> 00:13:45.480
So if somebody says I
need to know by 3 o'clock,

00:13:45.480 --> 00:13:47.670
then you've got to give
them an answer by 3 o'clock.

00:13:47.670 --> 00:13:49.790
But if somebody says we
want you to work on this,

00:13:49.790 --> 00:13:52.900
then most people want to
sort it out and come up

00:13:52.900 --> 00:13:56.240
with an answer, because
being in a state of limbo

00:13:56.240 --> 00:13:57.940
leaves you slightly anxious.

00:13:57.940 --> 00:13:59.640
You haven't resolved
it, you know?

00:13:59.640 --> 00:14:01.230
You'd like to say tick!

00:14:01.230 --> 00:14:02.810
Get on with it.

00:14:02.810 --> 00:14:04.730
And if you don't
resolve it, if you

00:14:04.730 --> 00:14:10.880
stay with that uncertainty,
the lack of resolution,

00:14:10.880 --> 00:14:13.380
then you come up with
better answers in the end.

00:14:13.380 --> 00:14:14.880
And that's the other
thing MacKinnon

00:14:14.880 --> 00:14:16.830
said about the
creative architects is

00:14:16.830 --> 00:14:20.720
they could tolerate that
sense of dissatisfaction

00:14:20.720 --> 00:14:25.260
when you can't actually
solve something yet.

00:14:25.260 --> 00:14:28.220
JASON SANDERS: You talk some
about the creative process,

00:14:28.220 --> 00:14:31.800
both here and in the
book, and you mentioned

00:14:31.800 --> 00:14:34.184
getting your start
at Cambridge in terms

00:14:34.184 --> 00:14:35.600
of performing with
the Footlights,

00:14:35.600 --> 00:14:37.070
and that's also
around the time you

00:14:37.070 --> 00:14:39.820
started developing a creative
process with Graham Chapman,

00:14:39.820 --> 00:14:40.635
right?

00:14:40.635 --> 00:14:43.220
Can you talk a little bit about
what your process was like

00:14:43.220 --> 00:14:44.980
and how it changed
over the years?

00:14:44.980 --> 00:14:47.990
JOHN CLEESE: Yes, well, when
I first sat down with Gray

00:14:47.990 --> 00:14:50.270
I was the engine room.

00:14:50.270 --> 00:14:52.220
I was the one who
pushed it forward

00:14:52.220 --> 00:14:54.925
and Gray would sit there
puffing on his pipe, staring out

00:14:54.925 --> 00:14:57.120
of the window, and
every now and again

00:14:57.120 --> 00:15:01.800
he would throw something in
and it was always off the wall

00:15:01.800 --> 00:15:04.390
or didn't quite follow from
what had been going before,

00:15:04.390 --> 00:15:08.380
so I tended to get too
sucked into a left brain.

00:15:08.380 --> 00:15:11.149
I know those terms are very
rough but-- from Sperry

00:15:11.149 --> 00:15:11.690
and all that.

00:15:11.690 --> 00:15:14.080
But, I mean, basically
it does mean something.

00:15:14.080 --> 00:15:15.690
I would get sucked
into that and I'd

00:15:15.690 --> 00:15:18.970
become a little bit predictable
because I was so logical.

00:15:18.970 --> 00:15:24.376
And Graham is the one who
would say, I don't know,

00:15:24.376 --> 00:15:25.250
bananas or something.

00:15:25.250 --> 00:15:29.050
He would say, oh, oh
that's interesting.

00:15:29.050 --> 00:15:32.190
So it worked very well because
the great thing about a team

00:15:32.190 --> 00:15:34.770
is that the members
of the team need

00:15:34.770 --> 00:15:38.349
to have completely different
skills, not the same one.

00:15:38.349 --> 00:15:40.140
There's no point in
having a team if people

00:15:40.140 --> 00:15:41.820
have the same skills.

00:15:41.820 --> 00:15:44.210
One of the things that
creativity psychologists have

00:15:44.210 --> 00:15:47.530
discovered is that if you put
a lot of middle-aged, white men

00:15:47.530 --> 00:15:50.720
together and give them
a creative problem,

00:15:50.720 --> 00:15:54.100
then they will report afterwards
what a profitable experience

00:15:54.100 --> 00:15:56.860
it was, how much they
enjoyed it, how much they'd

00:15:56.860 --> 00:16:00.060
like to do it in the future, and
it was all totally worthwhile,

00:16:00.060 --> 00:16:02.929
and they come up with fuck all.

00:16:02.929 --> 00:16:04.970
JASON SANDERS: So Congress
is what you're saying?

00:16:04.970 --> 00:16:10.770
JOHN CLEESE: Well you-- the
thing is-- that's very good.

00:16:10.770 --> 00:16:14.175
[LAUGHS] Fuck all.

00:16:14.175 --> 00:16:16.347
Anyway, keep going.

00:16:16.347 --> 00:16:18.180
JASON SANDERS: I didn't
mean to steal your--

00:16:18.180 --> 00:16:18.880
JOHN CLEESE: No, no, no, no.

00:16:18.880 --> 00:16:20.255
I forgot what I
was going to say.

00:16:20.255 --> 00:16:21.850
This happens because
I'm very tired.

00:16:21.850 --> 00:16:23.910
I've been traveling
for six weeks.

00:16:23.910 --> 00:16:28.010
I've done 30 shows in
40 days, and that's just

00:16:28.010 --> 00:16:29.000
the stage shows.

00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:31.480
I mean, I'm doing
"Stephen Colbert" tonight.

00:16:31.480 --> 00:16:32.570
JASON SANDERS: Wow.

00:16:32.570 --> 00:16:33.890
JOHN CLEESE: I get to where--

00:16:33.890 --> 00:16:36.708
JASON SANDERS: I didn't get this
before when I told them that I

00:16:36.708 --> 00:16:37.958
was going to be interviewing--

00:16:37.958 --> 00:16:38.810
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:16:38.810 --> 00:16:40.434
JOHN CLEESE: Well,
Colbert has asked me

00:16:40.434 --> 00:16:42.030
to do the furry hat with him.

00:16:42.030 --> 00:16:44.000
You know about the furry hat?

00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:45.680
So I'm being proud-- I'm proud.

00:16:45.680 --> 00:16:48.470
I'm the first person
to do the furry hat.

00:16:48.470 --> 00:16:50.180
So I'm looking to
him-- which means

00:16:50.180 --> 00:16:51.800
you make stupid pronouncements.

00:16:51.800 --> 00:16:53.070
JASON SANDERS: OK.

00:16:53.070 --> 00:16:54.320
JOHN CLEESE: So where were we?

00:16:54.320 --> 00:16:55.050
Can you remind--

00:16:55.050 --> 00:16:56.910
JASON SANDERS: Graham Chapman
and the process of writing.

00:16:56.910 --> 00:16:58.576
JOHN CLEESE: Yes,
well, he was-- you see

00:16:58.576 --> 00:17:01.340
and we worked well
together because we

00:17:01.340 --> 00:17:03.070
complemented each other.

00:17:03.070 --> 00:17:04.930
But we also-- which
really helped--

00:17:04.930 --> 00:17:06.625
had exactly the
same sense of humor.

00:17:06.625 --> 00:17:07.500
JASON SANDERS: Right.

00:17:07.500 --> 00:17:09.150
JOHN CLEESE: And when
you start writing

00:17:09.150 --> 00:17:12.850
comedy you're always wondering
to yourself, is this is funny?

00:17:12.850 --> 00:17:15.682
I mean, you laugh and then you
look at it again and think,

00:17:15.682 --> 00:17:17.180
well, I'm not sure it is funny.

00:17:17.180 --> 00:17:20.990
And what I discovered with
Gray is that if Gray laughed,

00:17:20.990 --> 00:17:22.530
it was funny.

00:17:22.530 --> 00:17:23.839
The audience would laugh.

00:17:23.839 --> 00:17:26.790
And it was extraordinarily
lucky to find someone

00:17:26.790 --> 00:17:29.370
like that because it was
like the big solution--

00:17:29.370 --> 00:17:30.190
big question.

00:17:30.190 --> 00:17:30.980
Is it funny?

00:17:30.980 --> 00:17:31.707
He answered it.

00:17:31.707 --> 00:17:33.540
JASON SANDERS: Did you
wonder that while you

00:17:33.540 --> 00:17:34.498
were writing this book?

00:17:34.498 --> 00:17:37.360
Because it is not meant
to be just comedy,

00:17:37.360 --> 00:17:39.200
but it's quite funny.

00:17:39.200 --> 00:17:41.685
JOHN CLEESE: Oh I'm trying
to be as funny as I can--

00:17:41.685 --> 00:17:44.487
JASON SANDERS: Did you worry at
all that it wasn't funny with--

00:17:44.487 --> 00:17:46.820
JOHN CLEESE: Well, no, I
thought it's all right provided

00:17:46.820 --> 00:17:49.500
it's-- I don't have to make
people laugh all the time

00:17:49.500 --> 00:17:51.570
provided I make them
laugh some of the time

00:17:51.570 --> 00:17:53.850
because that's
their expectation.

00:17:53.850 --> 00:17:56.156
So when I was writing
the book, I kind of

00:17:56.156 --> 00:17:57.530
thought sometimes,
well, this has

00:17:57.530 --> 00:18:00.020
been a bit serious for a bit,
so I'll now make it lighter.

00:18:00.020 --> 00:18:03.240
But it's very interesting being
interviewed about the book.

00:18:03.240 --> 00:18:05.120
Nobody says it's funny.

00:18:05.120 --> 00:18:07.220
They ask about your
relationship with your mother

00:18:07.220 --> 00:18:09.550
and all this kind of
stuff because that's

00:18:09.550 --> 00:18:11.626
what journalists write about.

00:18:11.626 --> 00:18:13.500
And then I say, yeah,
and what did you think?

00:18:13.500 --> 00:18:15.333
They say, oh, they
thought it was hilarious.

00:18:15.333 --> 00:18:18.830
I say, well, could you say so?

00:18:18.830 --> 00:18:20.580
JASON SANDERS: I thought
it was hilarious.

00:18:20.580 --> 00:18:22.220
[LAUGHTER]

00:18:22.220 --> 00:18:23.470
JOHN CLEESE: Thank you, Sonja.

00:18:23.470 --> 00:18:25.880
JASON SANDERS: And I put down
the card that had the question

00:18:25.880 --> 00:18:28.060
about your mother on it so we
won't-- we don't need to get

00:18:28.060 --> 00:18:28.420
into that.

00:18:28.420 --> 00:18:29.440
JOHN CLEESE: Well, I
don't mind doing it

00:18:29.440 --> 00:18:31.544
because there's a lot of
humor in the question.

00:18:31.544 --> 00:18:33.960
But what I mean is there's
certain things that journalists

00:18:33.960 --> 00:18:35.160
want to write about.

00:18:35.160 --> 00:18:36.706
There's a guy called
Sir David Hare

00:18:36.706 --> 00:18:37.830
who writes very good plays.

00:18:37.830 --> 00:18:40.180
But I never thought they were
as good as everyone else,

00:18:40.180 --> 00:18:43.080
although I like the man
immensely and he's very bright.

00:18:43.080 --> 00:18:45.580
And I say to someone,
why is he so successful?

00:18:45.580 --> 00:18:48.040
And the journalist said,
oh, he writes plays

00:18:48.040 --> 00:18:49.880
about all the things
that journalists

00:18:49.880 --> 00:18:51.800
want to write about.

00:18:51.800 --> 00:18:52.860
You see what I mean?

00:18:55.526 --> 00:18:56.900
JASON SANDERS:
You haven't always

00:18:56.900 --> 00:18:59.483
gotten on well with journalists,
especially in Britain, right?

00:18:59.483 --> 00:19:01.735
JOHN CLEESE: Oh, what a rabble.

00:19:05.280 --> 00:19:08.665
They're as stupid as the
Republican candidates

00:19:08.665 --> 00:19:10.359
at the present--

00:19:10.359 --> 00:19:15.090
[APPLAUSE]

00:19:15.090 --> 00:19:18.240
--and a lot more unpleasant.

00:19:18.240 --> 00:19:19.825
I mean, it is
extraordinary what's

00:19:19.825 --> 00:19:21.200
going on at the
moment, isn't it?

00:19:21.200 --> 00:19:24.030
When I came here in
'64, I was so impressed

00:19:24.030 --> 00:19:25.670
by everything American.

00:19:25.670 --> 00:19:28.885
I was here for 18 months,
and you were more efficient.

00:19:28.885 --> 00:19:30.540
You were more thoughtful.

00:19:30.540 --> 00:19:32.150
You were better organized.

00:19:32.150 --> 00:19:34.090
Everything was better.
"New York Times"

00:19:34.090 --> 00:19:36.210
the best newspaper I ever read.

00:19:36.210 --> 00:19:39.700
And now it's almost
the opposite,

00:19:39.700 --> 00:19:41.760
because what I
admired in '64 was

00:19:41.760 --> 00:19:45.000
that the Democrats
and the Republicans,

00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:47.030
they had friendships
across the aisle.

00:19:47.030 --> 00:19:48.280
They could talk to each other.

00:19:48.280 --> 00:19:50.000
They could do business.

00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:52.450
And it was so different from
England where the Labour

00:19:52.450 --> 00:19:54.790
or socialists and the
conservatives were always

00:19:54.790 --> 00:19:55.560
butting.

00:19:55.560 --> 00:19:59.480
And now you've got exactly
what we had in the mid '60s

00:19:59.480 --> 00:20:01.080
and what do you do about it?

00:20:01.080 --> 00:20:05.430
The answer is
democracy has failed.

00:20:05.430 --> 00:20:07.540
Some people when I
say that go, [GASPS].

00:20:07.540 --> 00:20:09.990
It's clearly failed
because it's predicated

00:20:09.990 --> 00:20:12.490
on an intelligent and
well-informed electorate.

00:20:12.490 --> 00:20:13.680
Doesn't exist.

00:20:13.680 --> 00:20:14.930
It doesn't exist here.

00:20:14.930 --> 00:20:16.500
It doesn't exist in England.

00:20:16.500 --> 00:20:18.170
So I kind of think, what's next?

00:20:18.170 --> 00:20:21.590
A benevolent
dictatorship I hope.

00:20:21.590 --> 00:20:23.582
Or even a malevolent
dictatorship.

00:20:23.582 --> 00:20:25.540
JASON SANDERS: Are you
putting yourself forward

00:20:25.540 --> 00:20:26.300
as a candidate?

00:20:26.300 --> 00:20:27.341
JOHN CLEESE: I'm too old.

00:20:27.341 --> 00:20:31.860
No, I'm too old, and I
couldn't-- I don't care about

00:20:31.860 --> 00:20:34.334
anything anymore,
you-- it's lovely.

00:20:34.334 --> 00:20:36.250
You know you're going
to be dead in 10 years--

00:20:36.250 --> 00:20:38.460
JASON SANDERS: Maybe
that's exactly who we need.

00:20:38.460 --> 00:20:42.050
JOHN CLEESE: Well, Reagan
was a bit like that.

00:20:42.050 --> 00:20:43.690
People have forgotten
this, but I'm

00:20:43.690 --> 00:20:46.980
so old I can remember that
when Reagan started his press

00:20:46.980 --> 00:20:50.645
conferences, the American
press corps were astonished

00:20:50.645 --> 00:20:54.340
at his ignorance and they
were scandalized by it.

00:20:54.340 --> 00:20:57.460
They started to write about
it, and the readership

00:20:57.460 --> 00:20:59.436
did not want to hear this.

00:20:59.436 --> 00:21:01.310
So after a time they
stopped writing about it

00:21:01.310 --> 00:21:03.190
because it was a
time after-- you'd

00:21:03.190 --> 00:21:07.260
had a series of very
ineffectual presidents or maybe

00:21:07.260 --> 00:21:09.460
unlucky presidents,
and they wanted

00:21:09.460 --> 00:21:11.860
to have someone in there that
made them feel comfortable.

00:21:11.860 --> 00:21:14.318
You know, somebody who's nice
and in charge, and it's fine,

00:21:14.318 --> 00:21:15.860
we can forget about it.

00:21:15.860 --> 00:21:17.580
And so the fact that
he was so ignorant

00:21:17.580 --> 00:21:20.730
was hushed up eventually by the
presses as a matter of policy.

00:21:20.730 --> 00:21:22.994
But in England, I mean, we
had ourself the worst press

00:21:22.994 --> 00:21:23.910
I've ever come across.

00:21:23.910 --> 00:21:28.775
I mean, "The Daily
Mail" is the very worst.

00:21:28.775 --> 00:21:32.940
But when you consider that a
woman called Rebekah Brooks was

00:21:32.940 --> 00:21:36.430
on trial for all
sorts of illegal acts

00:21:36.430 --> 00:21:41.181
but mostly to do with hacking,
that she was on trial--

00:21:41.181 --> 00:21:43.180
but she'd been editor of
the "News of the World"

00:21:43.180 --> 00:21:44.380
after Andy Coulson.

00:21:44.380 --> 00:21:47.650
She was on trial
with Andy Coulson.

00:21:47.650 --> 00:21:52.670
Andy Coulson was found
guilty of hacking

00:21:52.670 --> 00:21:56.950
and being aware of all the
malignant practices that

00:21:56.950 --> 00:21:58.830
were going on at the time.

00:21:58.830 --> 00:22:03.560
She was his lover over
quite a long course of time.

00:22:03.560 --> 00:22:12.050
She had ordered her staff to
delete three million emails.

00:22:12.050 --> 00:22:15.570
And at the end of it all
she was found innocent.

00:22:15.570 --> 00:22:18.450
She's guilty as hell.

00:22:18.450 --> 00:22:21.730
And there was such an outcry
she was withdrawn from Britain.

00:22:21.730 --> 00:22:26.240
She's now been put back in there
by Rupert Murdoch in charge

00:22:26.240 --> 00:22:28.450
of his four main titles.

00:22:28.450 --> 00:22:33.170
And the woman is
certainly a sociopath.

00:22:33.170 --> 00:22:42.200
I mean, addresses her employees
as cunts and fucking cunts,

00:22:42.200 --> 00:22:46.660
threw telephones at people,
and completely unscrupulous.

00:22:46.660 --> 00:22:49.150
Saying to people things like,
if you don't get this story,

00:22:49.150 --> 00:22:50.474
you're fired.

00:22:50.474 --> 00:22:52.890
Well, of course they're going
to go off and break the law,

00:22:52.890 --> 00:22:53.850
you know?

00:22:53.850 --> 00:22:55.950
It's like Hitler
or Himmler saying,

00:22:55.950 --> 00:22:58.680
[GERMAN ACCENT] oh, we had no
idea about the SS, you know.

00:22:58.680 --> 00:23:01.620
We knew they didn't
really like some people,

00:23:01.620 --> 00:23:05.910
but we had no idea they were
doing nasty things to them.

00:23:05.910 --> 00:23:07.690
All this going on
behind our back.

00:23:07.690 --> 00:23:11.620
Anyway, moving forward, because
we've got enough of this Monday

00:23:11.620 --> 00:23:14.364
night quarterbacking, you know?

00:23:14.364 --> 00:23:16.280
JASON SANDERS: Who hasn't
made a few mistakes?

00:23:16.280 --> 00:23:17.370
JOHN CLEESE: Exactly.

00:23:17.370 --> 00:23:17.900
Exactly.

00:23:17.900 --> 00:23:18.860
Mistakes were made.

00:23:18.860 --> 00:23:19.652
JASON SANDERS: Yes.

00:23:19.652 --> 00:23:21.318
JOHN CLEESE: There's
a book called that.

00:23:21.318 --> 00:23:22.180
I've just bought it.

00:23:22.180 --> 00:23:23.200
JASON SANDERS:
Yes, I've read it.

00:23:23.200 --> 00:23:23.530
It's quite good actually.

00:23:23.530 --> 00:23:24.446
JOHN CLEESE: Have you?

00:23:24.446 --> 00:23:25.510
JASON SANDERS: Yes.

00:23:25.510 --> 00:23:27.350
JOHN CLEESE: We'll
talk about that later.

00:23:27.350 --> 00:23:28.886
So what else can
I say that won't

00:23:28.886 --> 00:23:30.010
bore these people to death?

00:23:30.010 --> 00:23:32.051
JASON SANDERS: Well, you
mentioned Ronald Reagan.

00:23:32.051 --> 00:23:35.660
His counterpart in
Britain, Margaret Thatcher,

00:23:35.660 --> 00:23:37.760
I've read-- and is
it true-- that she

00:23:37.760 --> 00:23:40.220
put on a performance
of the parrot sketch?

00:23:40.220 --> 00:23:42.570
JOHN CLEESE: [LAUGHS]
You're right.

00:23:42.570 --> 00:23:44.570
JASON SANDERS: Was that
a good segue back into--

00:23:44.570 --> 00:23:46.403
JOHN CLEESE: It was
very good because that's

00:23:46.403 --> 00:23:47.360
exactly what she did.

00:23:47.360 --> 00:23:50.795
She was advised
by her colleagues

00:23:50.795 --> 00:23:53.620
that it would be nice to have
a little humor in her speech

00:23:53.620 --> 00:23:56.000
and she wanted to say
the Liberal Democrat

00:23:56.000 --> 00:23:59.350
party-- which incidentally
I support-- was dead

00:23:59.350 --> 00:24:00.010
and finished.

00:24:00.010 --> 00:24:01.470
And she did the parrot sketch.

00:24:01.470 --> 00:24:04.800
And I knew her foreign affairs
adviser, Charles Powell,

00:24:04.800 --> 00:24:10.130
very well, and he said, the
hours we spent rehearsing.

00:24:10.130 --> 00:24:13.740
She still just couldn't do it.

00:24:13.740 --> 00:24:16.880
And that's fascinating, isn't
it, that somebody that bright--

00:24:16.880 --> 00:24:18.200
because she was very bright.

00:24:18.200 --> 00:24:20.870
I mean, she was mad,
but she was bright.

00:24:20.870 --> 00:24:25.800
That somebody that bright
just had no idea how to do it.

00:24:25.800 --> 00:24:26.300
Funny.

00:24:26.300 --> 00:24:28.341
But I'll tell you something
else about the sketch

00:24:28.341 --> 00:24:30.180
because I told
this this morning.

00:24:30.180 --> 00:24:31.470
Absolutely true, this story.

00:24:31.470 --> 00:24:34.610
I'd done the sketch
on tour-- Monty Python

00:24:34.610 --> 00:24:38.950
tour with Michael Palin--
and we came off just

00:24:38.950 --> 00:24:43.060
before the end of the show
doing that as the finale.

00:24:43.060 --> 00:24:47.340
And I saw an anxious and
earnest young man standing

00:24:47.340 --> 00:24:48.010
in the wings.

00:24:48.010 --> 00:24:49.389
And he said-- and I said yeah?

00:24:49.389 --> 00:24:51.430
And he said, Mr. Cleese,
can I ask you something?

00:24:51.430 --> 00:24:52.610
I said, yes.

00:24:52.610 --> 00:24:54.190
He said, the parrot sketch.

00:24:54.190 --> 00:24:58.880
He said, it is about the
Vietnam War, isn't it?

00:24:58.880 --> 00:25:02.110
Is that what-- [LAUGHS]

00:25:02.110 --> 00:25:04.130
JASON SANDERS: We all
know it's about Korea.

00:25:04.130 --> 00:25:08.770
JOHN CLEESE: Well, actually,
it's Boer War, but still.

00:25:08.770 --> 00:25:11.440
JASON SANDERS: So the parrot
sketch-- everyone knows this.

00:25:11.440 --> 00:25:14.110
It's one of the most
well-known and hilarious bits

00:25:14.110 --> 00:25:14.860
from Monty Python.

00:25:14.860 --> 00:25:17.624
And you've mentioned
in the process

00:25:17.624 --> 00:25:20.290
of creating these things, you're
always wondering is this funny,

00:25:20.290 --> 00:25:21.642
are people going to like it.

00:25:21.642 --> 00:25:23.600
When you look back at
your career, which you've

00:25:23.600 --> 00:25:25.740
done through the process
of writing this book,

00:25:25.740 --> 00:25:28.712
what are the pieces
that you'd say, gosh,

00:25:28.712 --> 00:25:30.170
the answer to that
question was no?

00:25:30.170 --> 00:25:32.090
Like, that really
wasn't that funny

00:25:32.090 --> 00:25:34.267
and I wish I could go back.

00:25:34.267 --> 00:25:36.350
JOHN CLEESE: Well, I think
sometimes you just make

00:25:36.350 --> 00:25:40.480
things that aren't any good
and particularly with movies,

00:25:40.480 --> 00:25:43.360
it's not that surprising
because you assemble

00:25:43.360 --> 00:25:46.390
a team of 30 people
like that who may not

00:25:46.390 --> 00:25:47.950
know each other very well.

00:25:47.950 --> 00:25:50.210
And whether there's
good chemistry,

00:25:50.210 --> 00:25:52.550
as there was on "A Fish
Called Wanda," or not,

00:25:52.550 --> 00:25:54.190
it's really just a toss up.

00:25:54.190 --> 00:25:56.380
You can't control
that kind of thing.

00:25:56.380 --> 00:25:59.900
And also there's so many of
the people in charge of movies

00:25:59.900 --> 00:26:01.510
have no idea what they're doing.

00:26:01.510 --> 00:26:05.120
There's a fellow-- I'm a
phony professor at Cornell

00:26:05.120 --> 00:26:07.620
and I sometimes do
psychology stuff

00:26:07.620 --> 00:26:10.610
with a lovely professor
there called David Dunning.

00:26:10.610 --> 00:26:13.460
And David has discovered
something that's very relevant.

00:26:13.460 --> 00:26:15.920
He's discovered that in
order to know how good you

00:26:15.920 --> 00:26:20.200
are at something requires
almost exactly the same skills

00:26:20.200 --> 00:26:21.930
and aptitude as it
does to actually

00:26:21.930 --> 00:26:26.670
be good at it, which means
that if you're absolutely no

00:26:26.670 --> 00:26:30.620
good at something, you
lack exactly the skills

00:26:30.620 --> 00:26:35.250
and aptitudes that you need to
know that you're no good at it.

00:26:35.250 --> 00:26:38.624
Now that's tremendously
funny, I think.

00:26:42.420 --> 00:26:45.790
The worse you are, the
less chance you have

00:26:45.790 --> 00:26:48.110
of knowing how good
you are at something.

00:26:48.110 --> 00:26:52.140
And that explains a lot of life,
but particularly the Hollywood

00:26:52.140 --> 00:26:55.640
studios, because these people
have no idea what they're

00:26:55.640 --> 00:26:59.760
doing, but they have
absolutely no idea

00:26:59.760 --> 00:27:03.540
that they have no idea what--
and that just fills them

00:27:03.540 --> 00:27:04.510
with confidence.

00:27:04.510 --> 00:27:07.060
And that's the dangerous thing.

00:27:07.060 --> 00:27:09.471
JASON SANDERS: It's confidence
mixed with the anxiety

00:27:09.471 --> 00:27:10.220
over not feeling--

00:27:10.220 --> 00:27:11.520
JOHN CLEESE: Oh,
and the anxiety.

00:27:11.520 --> 00:27:13.270
And I think at a deep
level, they actually

00:27:13.270 --> 00:27:16.520
know they don't know, but
they can never say that.

00:27:16.520 --> 00:27:21.560
I remember sitting in the office
of an executive at Disney.

00:27:21.560 --> 00:27:23.020
And I'd written
a script to which

00:27:23.020 --> 00:27:26.280
she'd said we don't get
first drafts like this.

00:27:26.280 --> 00:27:28.910
This is 75% of the way there.

00:27:28.910 --> 00:27:31.530
And then she started telling
me what we wanted to do with

00:27:31.530 --> 00:27:35.010
the script, and I said
to her, let me explain,

00:27:35.010 --> 00:27:41.580
I cannot do that because I don't
know how to sit down at my desk

00:27:41.580 --> 00:27:45.420
to make the script worse.

00:27:45.420 --> 00:27:47.562
You see what I mean?

00:27:47.562 --> 00:27:48.770
I don't know how you do that.

00:27:48.770 --> 00:27:50.478
I suppose you have
lots of ideas and then

00:27:50.478 --> 00:27:53.580
you say that's the worst
one so let's do that.

00:27:53.580 --> 00:27:54.940
So I walked away from the movie.

00:27:54.940 --> 00:27:57.077
But they have no idea
what they're doing.

00:27:57.077 --> 00:27:58.910
JASON SANDERS: You ever
have another project

00:27:58.910 --> 00:28:01.850
like that I'm sure I
could help make it worse.

00:28:01.850 --> 00:28:03.310
JOHN CLEESE: Right.

00:28:03.310 --> 00:28:05.930
JASON SANDERS: You mentioned
"A Fish Called Wanda."

00:28:05.930 --> 00:28:09.620
It's one of your biggest
successes, especially in films.

00:28:09.620 --> 00:28:10.847
You're working on a musical?

00:28:10.847 --> 00:28:12.680
JOHN CLEESE: Well, I'm
working on a musical.

00:28:12.680 --> 00:28:17.360
I wrote the first
draft of the book--

00:28:17.360 --> 00:28:22.470
the story, the dialogue--
with my lovely daughter.

00:28:22.470 --> 00:28:24.422
And we'll have
to-- the trouble is

00:28:24.422 --> 00:28:26.380
we're trying to do a deal
with MGM because they

00:28:26.380 --> 00:28:27.010
own the rights.

00:28:27.010 --> 00:28:29.224
And of course they
want 99% of everything.

00:28:29.224 --> 00:28:30.640
So I don't know
if that will work.

00:28:30.640 --> 00:28:31.880
But I'd love to do a musical.

00:28:31.880 --> 00:28:33.380
I mean, I'm actually terrible.

00:28:33.380 --> 00:28:37.980
I mean, I'm so bad at
singing and anything musical

00:28:37.980 --> 00:28:43.550
that when I actually got into
a Broadway musical by accident

00:28:43.550 --> 00:28:48.730
I was told by the musical
director not to sing.

00:28:48.730 --> 00:28:51.780
He said just learn
the lines and mime.

00:28:51.780 --> 00:28:53.190
I'm that bad at music.

00:28:53.190 --> 00:28:55.400
But I would like to do a
musical because that's not

00:28:55.400 --> 00:28:56.930
an experience I've ever had.

00:28:56.930 --> 00:29:00.800
And I've actually just been
offered a possible sitcom here

00:29:00.800 --> 00:29:01.420
in America.

00:29:01.420 --> 00:29:02.420
Very offbeat.

00:29:02.420 --> 00:29:06.080
A sort of Larry
David type of thing.

00:29:06.080 --> 00:29:07.360
So that's around.

00:29:07.360 --> 00:29:11.630
And I've also recently adapted
a wonderful French farce.

00:29:11.630 --> 00:29:14.200
Americans, I think
you don't know

00:29:14.200 --> 00:29:16.140
so much about French farces.

00:29:16.140 --> 00:29:20.820
It's not so much of your
culture as it is in England.

00:29:20.820 --> 00:29:25.468
But the one I've adapted
was written in 1890

00:29:25.468 --> 00:29:29.480
by a guy called Georges
Feydeau and it's

00:29:29.480 --> 00:29:31.820
better constructed
than any comedy

00:29:31.820 --> 00:29:34.320
I've seen in the last 20 years.

00:29:34.320 --> 00:29:36.290
They understood
in those days how

00:29:36.290 --> 00:29:40.310
to create these wonderfully
complex plots that were always

00:29:40.310 --> 00:29:42.950
like bits of clockwork,
you know what I mean?

00:29:42.950 --> 00:29:45.300
And they're just
superbly created.

00:29:45.300 --> 00:29:50.000
So I pinched that because
it's out of copyright.

00:29:50.000 --> 00:29:52.080
And I've turned that
into a stage play.

00:29:52.080 --> 00:29:53.650
So I've got various
things going.

00:29:53.650 --> 00:29:54.660
JASON SANDERS: OK, you've
got some things going.

00:29:54.660 --> 00:29:57.619
Do you find yourself watching
television these days?

00:29:57.619 --> 00:29:58.660
JOHN CLEESE: No, I don't.

00:29:58.660 --> 00:30:01.080
And I'll tell you why,
because I've realized

00:30:01.080 --> 00:30:06.240
I think I have become extremely
wise because-- no, seriously--

00:30:06.240 --> 00:30:13.020
because Socrates said
that wisdom was really

00:30:13.020 --> 00:30:15.360
knowing how little you know.

00:30:15.360 --> 00:30:20.460
And I sincerely believe now
that I know almost nothing.

00:30:20.460 --> 00:30:22.350
And I think that I'm
sitting in a room

00:30:22.350 --> 00:30:24.430
with people who do
think they know things.

00:30:28.720 --> 00:30:32.936
Well, you know, and I'm
very skeptical about it all.

00:30:32.936 --> 00:30:35.720
I think we don't know
anything important.

00:30:35.720 --> 00:30:37.920
And if you follow the
history of science,

00:30:37.920 --> 00:30:40.410
it's terribly funny
that scientists

00:30:40.410 --> 00:30:43.670
keep announcing either that
they've discovered something

00:30:43.670 --> 00:30:46.250
or they're very, very close
to discovering something

00:30:46.250 --> 00:30:48.620
except it never happens.

00:30:48.620 --> 00:30:55.860
There was a professor
of philosophy-- sorry,

00:30:55.860 --> 00:30:59.790
a guy called Karl
Popper who is the best,

00:30:59.790 --> 00:31:03.420
I think, the best philosopher
of science in the last century.

00:31:03.420 --> 00:31:06.870
And he called it promissory
materialism, which

00:31:06.870 --> 00:31:09.860
is it's going to be there
any moment but just--

00:31:09.860 --> 00:31:13.550
and then I remember the AI
stuff coming 15 years ago.

00:31:13.550 --> 00:31:16.336
Oh, we're just on the edge of
cracking-- what is that noise?

00:31:16.336 --> 00:31:17.960
[METALLIC NOISE]

00:31:17.960 --> 00:31:19.470
JASON SANDERS: Must
be construction.

00:31:19.470 --> 00:31:21.600
JOHN CLEESE: Oh, really?

00:31:21.600 --> 00:31:22.960
Oh.

00:31:22.960 --> 00:31:25.460
I thought it was a micro--

00:31:25.460 --> 00:31:34.300
And he said, and you see-- he
said that scientific progress

00:31:34.300 --> 00:31:36.310
is all about falsification.

00:31:36.310 --> 00:31:38.940
That if you can't
falsify something then

00:31:38.940 --> 00:31:40.500
you can't prove it either.

00:31:40.500 --> 00:31:41.410
See what I mean?

00:31:41.410 --> 00:31:42.640
You have a theory.

00:31:42.640 --> 00:31:46.290
That theory has got to be
tested and is falsifiable.

00:31:46.290 --> 00:31:48.340
And I think people
don't understand that

00:31:48.340 --> 00:31:53.270
and they constantly think that
scientists are cracking it

00:31:53.270 --> 00:31:54.640
and they're never cracking it.

00:31:54.640 --> 00:31:56.620
They're just improving
things bit by bit.

00:31:56.620 --> 00:32:00.301
But often they go down an
absolutely, completely wrong

00:32:00.301 --> 00:32:00.800
road.

00:32:00.800 --> 00:32:05.900
I mean, there was a physicist
called Lord Kelvin who,

00:32:05.900 --> 00:32:12.460
I think it was about 1898-- yes,
I think it was 1898-- announced

00:32:12.460 --> 00:32:16.540
that all the problems in physics
have now been solved that were

00:32:16.540 --> 00:32:19.120
important and that all
they were doing now

00:32:19.120 --> 00:32:22.610
is arguing about the
fourth decimal point.

00:32:22.610 --> 00:32:23.110
All right?

00:32:23.110 --> 00:32:28.110
That was seven years before
Einstein discovered relativity.

00:32:28.110 --> 00:32:31.180
And that world-- the
predictable, materialist

00:32:31.180 --> 00:32:34.326
world-- fell apart, but they
were absolutely convinced

00:32:34.326 --> 00:32:35.200
that they were there.

00:32:35.200 --> 00:32:36.860
And I think that's
the question now.

00:32:36.860 --> 00:32:41.040
I was talking to a very clever
man called Rupert Sheldrake

00:32:41.040 --> 00:32:42.460
recently, and he
said they're now

00:32:42.460 --> 00:32:46.480
trying to replicate a lot of
experiments that have been

00:32:46.480 --> 00:32:50.460
done that are not replicating.

00:32:50.460 --> 00:32:53.800
That 60% of the experiments
in social science

00:32:53.800 --> 00:32:57.400
that have been part of the
knowledge of social science,

00:32:57.400 --> 00:32:59.050
they're not able
to replicate them.

00:32:59.050 --> 00:33:01.190
And a smaller
percentage, like 45,

00:33:01.190 --> 00:33:04.160
is true of medical research.

00:33:04.160 --> 00:33:05.764
So everything's
beginning to change.

00:33:05.764 --> 00:33:07.680
There are all sorts of
odd theories out there.

00:33:07.680 --> 00:33:12.030
Maybe the physical laws
of the universe evolve.

00:33:12.030 --> 00:33:14.050
And I think we
don't know, you see.

00:33:14.050 --> 00:33:15.960
What I notice
about scientists is

00:33:15.960 --> 00:33:20.140
they don't want to know about
the philosophy of science.

00:33:20.140 --> 00:33:22.400
They want to just do science.

00:33:22.400 --> 00:33:25.970
Well, I say, well, you
don't want to examine

00:33:25.970 --> 00:33:28.982
your own assumptions?

00:33:28.982 --> 00:33:30.690
This is an extraordinary
arrogance there.

00:33:30.690 --> 00:33:34.530
I once had dinner with
Stephen Jay Gould, right?

00:33:34.530 --> 00:33:36.140
You know him?

00:33:36.140 --> 00:33:38.030
Famous, famous biologist.

00:33:38.030 --> 00:33:42.035
And I was chatting to him-- a
bit arrogant, but I liked him.

00:33:42.035 --> 00:33:45.340
And I said to him,
what are you doing?

00:33:45.340 --> 00:33:47.890
And he told me about four books
that he was about to write

00:33:47.890 --> 00:33:49.598
and he knew exactly
what was in the book.

00:33:49.598 --> 00:33:52.930
And I said, now, if God called
you into his office, Stephen,

00:33:52.930 --> 00:33:55.410
and he sat you down
and said you can

00:33:55.410 --> 00:33:59.060
ask me one question about
something that's been puzzling

00:33:59.060 --> 00:34:02.720
you all your life and you
would love to understand,

00:34:02.720 --> 00:34:04.400
what would it be?

00:34:04.400 --> 00:34:08.580
And Gould said, I
can't think of one.

00:34:08.580 --> 00:34:09.665
This is a scientist.

00:34:12.380 --> 00:34:15.330
You're obviously unimpressed.

00:34:15.330 --> 00:34:18.460
To me that is
absolutely appalling.

00:34:18.460 --> 00:34:22.030
And so I'm kind of
deliberately needling you guys

00:34:22.030 --> 00:34:26.420
because I think you've got to
understand that we don't know

00:34:26.420 --> 00:34:28.640
as much as we think we know.

00:34:28.640 --> 00:34:31.179
I'm waiting for a moment
when somebody in a white coat

00:34:31.179 --> 00:34:33.639
one day stands up and
says, we scientists

00:34:33.639 --> 00:34:36.800
now know that we know
less than we thought.

00:34:40.300 --> 00:34:43.280
JASON SANDERS: Results show--

00:34:43.280 --> 00:34:46.093
JOHN CLEESE: Yes, well, Rupert
Murdoch-- Rupert Murdoch,

00:34:46.093 --> 00:34:48.409
what am I saying!

00:34:48.409 --> 00:34:53.540
Rupert Sheldrake and I
are working on something

00:34:53.540 --> 00:34:55.909
to tease scientists
to be a little less

00:34:55.909 --> 00:34:58.380
sure about what they're doing.

00:34:58.380 --> 00:35:04.270
For example, the professor of
psychology emeritus at Cornell

00:35:04.270 --> 00:35:07.950
has done an experiment
and it has been replicated

00:35:07.950 --> 00:35:09.520
and it's very
similar to one done

00:35:09.520 --> 00:35:13.570
by a guy called
Dean Raving-- Dean

00:35:13.570 --> 00:35:17.500
Radin at the Institute
of Noetic Sciences

00:35:17.500 --> 00:35:19.600
across the bridge
in San Francisco.

00:35:19.600 --> 00:35:21.850
And what Dean did, which
is a very simple version

00:35:21.850 --> 00:35:24.100
of the experiment,
is he sat people down

00:35:24.100 --> 00:35:27.120
in front of a television
screen and he showed them

00:35:27.120 --> 00:35:29.330
three categories of pictures.

00:35:29.330 --> 00:35:30.830
He showed them
pictures that were

00:35:30.830 --> 00:35:33.160
of everyday objects
like a telephone

00:35:33.160 --> 00:35:36.440
or a glass of water or a boot.

00:35:36.440 --> 00:35:40.460
Then showed them
nice, very slightly

00:35:40.460 --> 00:35:43.120
pornographic things, but
nothing hard or shocking.

00:35:43.120 --> 00:35:46.950
Just rather sort of sexy,
nice, warm, makes you feel hm,

00:35:46.950 --> 00:35:48.320
you know, sort of pictures.

00:35:48.320 --> 00:35:50.420
And then he had a series
of pictures of things

00:35:50.420 --> 00:35:56.640
like accidents and operations
that make people go [SQUEAK].

00:35:56.640 --> 00:35:59.160
And he would send these
pictures into the room

00:35:59.160 --> 00:36:01.110
where the subject was
sitting looking up

00:36:01.110 --> 00:36:03.650
at them on the screen,
and what we discovered,

00:36:03.650 --> 00:36:05.240
because the subjects
were wired up

00:36:05.240 --> 00:36:07.760
with that sort of lie
detection so if you

00:36:07.760 --> 00:36:10.260
know how they-- what is it?

00:36:10.260 --> 00:36:14.905
When you sweat, the resistance
of the-- what's it called?

00:36:14.905 --> 00:36:15.888
AUDIENCE: Polygraph.

00:36:15.888 --> 00:36:16.386
JOHN CLEESE: Oh?

00:36:16.386 --> 00:36:16.884
AUDIENCE: Polygraph--

00:36:16.884 --> 00:36:17.967
AUDIENCE: Skin resistance.

00:36:17.967 --> 00:36:20.860
JOHN CLEESE: Yes, that's right.

00:36:20.860 --> 00:36:24.230
And what he discovered
was that about two seconds

00:36:24.230 --> 00:36:27.310
before they saw
the nasty pictures,

00:36:27.310 --> 00:36:31.020
they started to sweat.

00:36:31.020 --> 00:36:34.170
There was no way that
they could have known

00:36:34.170 --> 00:36:35.630
what picture was coming up.

00:36:35.630 --> 00:36:39.340
They didn't sweat if they were
going to get a nice picture.

00:36:39.340 --> 00:36:42.570
Well, they were
generated randomly.

00:36:42.570 --> 00:36:45.760
Now, you can't explain that.

00:36:45.760 --> 00:36:48.480
And this is a professor
who carries it out

00:36:48.480 --> 00:36:51.190
and other people
have replicated it.

00:36:51.190 --> 00:36:53.770
So there's an awful
lot going on for--

00:36:53.770 --> 00:36:57.330
Oh, somebody's leaving.

00:36:57.330 --> 00:36:58.040
Bye.

00:36:58.040 --> 00:36:58.830
Have a nice lunch.

00:36:58.830 --> 00:37:00.000
[LAUGHTER]

00:37:00.000 --> 00:37:03.040
There's an awful lot going on
that I think we think we know

00:37:03.040 --> 00:37:03.890
about and we don't.

00:37:03.890 --> 00:37:06.100
And you guys are
particularly prone to it

00:37:06.100 --> 00:37:09.810
because you do highly, highly
intellectual work, you know?

00:37:09.810 --> 00:37:11.660
Don't forget the right brain.

00:37:11.660 --> 00:37:13.860
Don't forget that
instinctive thing,

00:37:13.860 --> 00:37:19.900
because if you read what
Nobel Prize winning scientists

00:37:19.900 --> 00:37:22.160
say about the moment
of inspiration,

00:37:22.160 --> 00:37:25.160
you'll discover that
it's not logical.

00:37:25.160 --> 00:37:27.120
It's nothing to do with logic.

00:37:27.120 --> 00:37:30.510
It's to do with some idea
that sometimes comes in

00:37:30.510 --> 00:37:32.960
from left field, and
they've become very famous

00:37:32.960 --> 00:37:35.660
and some of them actually
feel they don't deserve it

00:37:35.660 --> 00:37:38.760
because they don't really
feel it was their idea.

00:37:38.760 --> 00:37:42.309
It just seemed to come to
them from somewhere else.

00:37:42.309 --> 00:37:43.100
JASON SANDERS: So--

00:37:43.100 --> 00:37:44.160
JOHN CLEESE: Let's
take some questions--

00:37:44.160 --> 00:37:45.050
JASON SANDERS: I was
just going to say,

00:37:45.050 --> 00:37:48.240
speaking of how little everyone
here knows about everything,

00:37:48.240 --> 00:37:52.259
if you make your way to one of
the two microphones, you'll--

00:37:52.259 --> 00:37:53.050
JOHN CLEESE: Hello.

00:37:53.050 --> 00:37:55.200
AUDIENCE: Thank
you for being here.

00:37:55.200 --> 00:37:59.680
So, given that the way that
people can produce and create

00:37:59.680 --> 00:38:03.200
and share comedy,
creativity in general,

00:38:03.200 --> 00:38:09.030
I would love to hear your take
on the new-- having YouTube,

00:38:09.030 --> 00:38:12.130
et cetera, to produce
comedy and produce content,

00:38:12.130 --> 00:38:13.370
and where you see that going.

00:38:13.370 --> 00:38:15.078
JOHN CLEESE: Well, I
don't know because I

00:38:15.078 --> 00:38:17.130
don't think anywhere sees it.

00:38:17.130 --> 00:38:19.630
It's impossible to see what's
happening technologically

00:38:19.630 --> 00:38:20.820
at the moment.

00:38:20.820 --> 00:38:24.190
And I was thinking just recently
how lucky the Monty Pythons

00:38:24.190 --> 00:38:29.040
were that our two best films
were set in historical periods

00:38:29.040 --> 00:38:30.590
and can't date.

00:38:30.590 --> 00:38:32.950
And it was an
extraordinary piece of luck

00:38:32.950 --> 00:38:34.970
because we didn't know that.

00:38:34.970 --> 00:38:36.970
It wasn't intentional.

00:38:36.970 --> 00:38:42.790
So, let me think, let
me think, let me think.

00:38:42.790 --> 00:38:44.665
I just don't know
what's going on

00:38:44.665 --> 00:38:47.480
and I don't understand
what's going on.

00:38:47.480 --> 00:38:51.480
By which I mean I sometimes
understand the words.

00:38:51.480 --> 00:38:53.920
You know, like when
there's some people who

00:38:53.920 --> 00:38:57.330
dress up in latex
rubber in order

00:38:57.330 --> 00:39:00.430
to become sexually excited.

00:39:00.430 --> 00:39:02.860
Now, I know what all
those words mean--

00:39:02.860 --> 00:39:07.126
[LAUGHTER]

00:39:09.022 --> 00:39:13.010
I mean, the idea that
anybody seriously

00:39:13.010 --> 00:39:18.560
is interested in
the Kardashians,

00:39:18.560 --> 00:39:22.010
I'm utterly mystified.

00:39:22.010 --> 00:39:25.230
You see, that's how I feel
about most of technology.

00:39:25.230 --> 00:39:27.800
I'm reading a lot of stuff
at the moment about how

00:39:27.800 --> 00:39:29.520
is it affecting us all.

00:39:29.520 --> 00:39:31.550
I've certainly come
to the conclusion

00:39:31.550 --> 00:39:34.050
that all this stuff
about multitasking

00:39:34.050 --> 00:39:37.820
has been shown by
research it doesn't work.

00:39:37.820 --> 00:39:40.110
You get less done and
it takes you longer,

00:39:40.110 --> 00:39:42.610
but people run around
talking about the fact they

00:39:42.610 --> 00:39:43.540
can multitask.

00:39:43.540 --> 00:39:45.110
So I think we have to look.

00:39:45.110 --> 00:39:46.320
There's a great book.

00:39:46.320 --> 00:39:48.537
If you haven't read this
book, please read it.

00:39:48.537 --> 00:39:49.670
Written by a New Yorker.

00:39:49.670 --> 00:39:52.050
He was a professor
of communications,

00:39:52.050 --> 00:39:54.780
but he liked anonymity so
he'd never say where he was,

00:39:54.780 --> 00:39:58.310
but his name was Neil
Postman, as in mailman.

00:39:58.310 --> 00:39:59.160
Neil Postman.

00:39:59.160 --> 00:40:02.620
It's called "Technopoly."

00:40:02.620 --> 00:40:05.600
And I honestly suggest
you run out and read it

00:40:05.600 --> 00:40:08.090
because you'll be
absolutely fascinated

00:40:08.090 --> 00:40:10.580
because it's about the
skepticism that I feel

00:40:10.580 --> 00:40:13.330
about technology because
people always invent

00:40:13.330 --> 00:40:15.550
a bit of great technology
and they see all

00:40:15.550 --> 00:40:17.620
the positive benefits
but because we're

00:40:17.620 --> 00:40:20.600
such flawed creatures
then everyone comes along

00:40:20.600 --> 00:40:22.405
as a second stage and
there's a whole lot

00:40:22.405 --> 00:40:24.700
of negative benefits--
or negative whatever.

00:40:24.700 --> 00:40:25.990
You see what I mean.

00:40:25.990 --> 00:40:27.570
And people never see that.

00:40:27.570 --> 00:40:30.577
Sir, ask your question.

00:40:30.577 --> 00:40:32.160
AUDIENCE: I was
wondering if you would

00:40:32.160 --> 00:40:35.720
tell the story of how the
Ministry of Funny Walks

00:40:35.720 --> 00:40:36.717
sketch came about.

00:40:36.717 --> 00:40:38.550
JOHN CLEESE: Oh, yes,
well I can't because I

00:40:38.550 --> 00:40:40.310
didn't write it.

00:40:40.310 --> 00:40:44.900
It was presented to me by
Michael Palin and Terry Jones.

00:40:44.900 --> 00:40:47.880
They had written it and
they said will you do it

00:40:47.880 --> 00:40:50.385
and I said yeah, I will.

00:40:50.385 --> 00:40:52.450
I wasn't very keen on the piece.

00:40:52.450 --> 00:40:54.540
I never thought it was
anything like as funny

00:40:54.540 --> 00:40:56.166
as everyone else did.

00:40:56.166 --> 00:40:57.860
Seriously.

00:40:57.860 --> 00:41:01.020
And I remember my disappointment
on the theatrical tour

00:41:01.020 --> 00:41:03.140
of Python when they
pleaded with me to do it

00:41:03.140 --> 00:41:05.210
at the beginning of the tour.

00:41:05.210 --> 00:41:07.110
We opened in--
where did we open?

00:41:07.110 --> 00:41:07.960
Southampton.

00:41:07.960 --> 00:41:11.200
And to my great
delight as I capered

00:41:11.200 --> 00:41:15.070
around the stage throwing
my legs in all directions

00:41:15.070 --> 00:41:19.040
to complete silence.

00:41:19.040 --> 00:41:20.750
Utterly humiliating.

00:41:20.750 --> 00:41:24.500
When I got off stage, I said,
there, see, it's no good.

00:41:24.500 --> 00:41:27.710
I'm never doing the
fucking thing again.

00:41:27.710 --> 00:41:30.870
And they say, one more
night, do it one more night.

00:41:30.870 --> 00:41:32.750
And I did it in
Brighton the next night.

00:41:32.750 --> 00:41:35.300
And the buggers laughed.

00:41:35.300 --> 00:41:37.570
And I was stuck with
it from then on.

00:41:37.570 --> 00:41:41.650
It's quite an energetic sketch
that Mike and Terry came up

00:41:41.650 --> 00:41:42.329
with.

00:41:42.329 --> 00:41:43.870
AUDIENCE: Graham
Chapman told a story

00:41:43.870 --> 00:41:49.530
that there was a person walking
by the hedge at your house

00:41:49.530 --> 00:41:52.550
and his head was
aligned strangely

00:41:52.550 --> 00:41:54.600
and you came up with
the walk that way.

00:41:54.600 --> 00:41:56.225
JOHN CLEESE: No, I
don't remember that.

00:41:56.225 --> 00:41:57.660
AUDIENCE: You don't remember.

00:41:57.660 --> 00:41:59.900
JOHN CLEESE: Graham had
a very tenuous connection

00:41:59.900 --> 00:42:00.455
with reality.

00:42:03.560 --> 00:42:04.440
But he was wonderful.

00:42:04.440 --> 00:42:06.780
I mean, the funniest thing-- I
mean, this is absolutely true,

00:42:06.780 --> 00:42:07.279
what he did.

00:42:07.279 --> 00:42:09.400
The Oxford Union at
Oxford University

00:42:09.400 --> 00:42:12.920
was a place where all the
British prime ministers came

00:42:12.920 --> 00:42:14.860
through the Oxford
system and they all

00:42:14.860 --> 00:42:17.760
did these speeches
in the great chamber

00:42:17.760 --> 00:42:19.560
and they all pretend
to be politicians.

00:42:19.560 --> 00:42:20.820
They're about 19.

00:42:20.820 --> 00:42:23.600
You know, they put waistcoats
on and they stand like that

00:42:23.600 --> 00:42:24.475
and they pontificate.

00:42:24.475 --> 00:42:27.320
It was ridiculous.

00:42:27.320 --> 00:42:29.190
Absolutely ridiculous.

00:42:29.190 --> 00:42:33.330
Anyway, they decided to have
a big debate, high profile,

00:42:33.330 --> 00:42:36.210
on nuclear disarmament,
and they invited Graham

00:42:36.210 --> 00:42:39.050
because he was a bright
and very educated guy.

00:42:39.050 --> 00:42:41.647
And they invited-- there
was a general there

00:42:41.647 --> 00:42:43.480
and there were a couple
of politicians there

00:42:43.480 --> 00:42:46.140
and a couple of top
television pundits.

00:42:46.140 --> 00:42:50.130
And Graham turned up for this
extremely important debate

00:42:50.130 --> 00:42:51.400
dressed as a carrot.

00:42:51.400 --> 00:42:55.740
[LAUGHTER]

00:42:55.740 --> 00:42:58.095
So you have a general
sitting next to a guy dressed

00:42:58.095 --> 00:42:59.746
as a carrot.

00:42:59.746 --> 00:43:01.740
And when it was
his turn to speak,

00:43:01.740 --> 00:43:04.610
he got up and refused
to say anything.

00:43:04.610 --> 00:43:06.240
He just stood there
for 12 minutes.

00:43:06.240 --> 00:43:08.270
Of course, the Oxford
people got very upset

00:43:08.270 --> 00:43:10.120
because they felt they
were losing dignity

00:43:10.120 --> 00:43:12.580
and they sort of shouting
rude stuff at him

00:43:12.580 --> 00:43:16.010
and he just stood
there for 12 minutes

00:43:16.010 --> 00:43:20.410
and then sat down really
proud he ruined the debate.

00:43:20.410 --> 00:43:22.830
He was an extraordinary chap.

00:43:22.830 --> 00:43:23.524
Yes, sir?

00:43:23.524 --> 00:43:25.440
AUDIENCE: I was wondering
if you could comment

00:43:25.440 --> 00:43:29.830
on the differences of senses of
humor between British audiences

00:43:29.830 --> 00:43:30.850
and American audiences.

00:43:30.850 --> 00:43:32.720
JOHN CLEESE: Yes, I don't
think it's that great, you see,

00:43:32.720 --> 00:43:34.840
but then you immediately
get into sense of humor.

00:43:34.840 --> 00:43:38.970
One of the things you realize
is that people's sense of humor

00:43:38.970 --> 00:43:42.320
is much more subjective
and much more individual.

00:43:42.320 --> 00:43:45.359
When I do my stage show I
show these clips on the screen

00:43:45.359 --> 00:43:46.775
and from the light
of the screen I

00:43:46.775 --> 00:43:48.230
can watch the first four rows.

00:43:48.230 --> 00:43:52.030
And what's extraordinary is how
different their reactions are.

00:43:52.030 --> 00:43:54.250
One guy over here
would be falling about.

00:43:54.250 --> 00:43:58.640
One will look as though he's
just been told he's got cancer.

00:43:58.640 --> 00:44:00.500
Two or three people
will be smiling

00:44:00.500 --> 00:44:01.960
quite in an amused away.

00:44:01.960 --> 00:44:04.900
Somebody over there's laughing
OK, but not falling around.

00:44:04.900 --> 00:44:07.040
And then as you go on
watching the stuff,

00:44:07.040 --> 00:44:09.610
suddenly the silent guy
starts to laugh at something

00:44:09.610 --> 00:44:12.280
that the guy who was falling
about doesn't laugh at.

00:44:12.280 --> 00:44:15.210
So the sense of humor's much
more subjective than you think.

00:44:15.210 --> 00:44:18.120
And the question is it
funny is meaningless,

00:44:18.120 --> 00:44:21.490
because what it really says
is do you think it's funny?

00:44:21.490 --> 00:44:24.530
And when I was doing
Python with the other guys,

00:44:24.530 --> 00:44:28.535
I used to say if we
laugh then we just hope

00:44:28.535 --> 00:44:30.610
that there's enough
people out there who

00:44:30.610 --> 00:44:31.970
also think it's funny.

00:44:31.970 --> 00:44:34.810
But we're not going to try
and work out, you know,

00:44:34.810 --> 00:44:36.390
what the demographic is.

00:44:36.390 --> 00:44:38.369
We're just going to do
what we think is funny.

00:44:38.369 --> 00:44:39.660
Does that answer your question?

00:44:39.660 --> 00:44:40.370
AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:44:40.370 --> 00:44:40.630
JOHN CLEESE: Yes?

00:44:40.630 --> 00:44:41.492
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:44:41.492 --> 00:44:42.354
JOHN CLEESE: Hello.

00:44:42.354 --> 00:44:43.220
AUDIENCE: Hello.

00:44:43.220 --> 00:44:45.280
This quietness
that you discuss--

00:44:45.280 --> 00:44:49.070
there is this pressure in
whatever we do to produce very,

00:44:49.070 --> 00:44:52.320
very quickly, and I think
we see that a lot in comedy.

00:44:52.320 --> 00:44:56.430
There's so much pressure
to create very frequently.

00:44:56.430 --> 00:44:58.430
Some people are very
gifted improvisers

00:44:58.430 --> 00:45:01.660
whereas others succeed more
with more long term projects.

00:45:01.660 --> 00:45:04.090
But how can we
balance that quietness

00:45:04.090 --> 00:45:06.660
with still pushing ourselves
to improvise quickly

00:45:06.660 --> 00:45:08.510
to just produce better overall?

00:45:08.510 --> 00:45:10.990
JOHN CLEESE: Well, I once asked
a very famous screenwriter

00:45:10.990 --> 00:45:14.990
and I'm trying to think of his
name, but he wrote "Chinatown."

00:45:14.990 --> 00:45:16.112
Hm?

00:45:16.112 --> 00:45:17.277
AUDIENCE: Robert Towne.

00:45:17.277 --> 00:45:18.360
JOHN CLEESE: Robert Towne.

00:45:18.360 --> 00:45:19.110
Thank you.

00:45:19.110 --> 00:45:20.699
I was presenting
an award to him,

00:45:20.699 --> 00:45:22.740
as I was asked if I would
present an award to him

00:45:22.740 --> 00:45:25.930
at a big writers get-together,
writers award ceremony, which

00:45:25.930 --> 00:45:28.240
I accepted immediately
because I knew

00:45:28.240 --> 00:45:31.590
there would be no journalists
or photographers there.

00:45:31.590 --> 00:45:34.880
And I talked to
Towne and I said--

00:45:34.880 --> 00:45:36.890
and he was talking
about a particular time

00:45:36.890 --> 00:45:39.240
when they realized
a scene didn't work

00:45:39.240 --> 00:45:40.950
and the pressure
was on, and I said,

00:45:40.950 --> 00:45:46.990
but, Robert, how did you manage
to produce that brilliant idea

00:45:46.990 --> 00:45:48.120
under that pressure?

00:45:48.120 --> 00:45:54.530
And he said, I seem to be able
to forget that there's a time

00:45:54.530 --> 00:45:59.700
pressure, because normally
time pressure makes you anxious

00:45:59.700 --> 00:46:01.550
and anything that
makes you anxious

00:46:01.550 --> 00:46:07.034
creatively pushes you back
in a stereotypical direction.

00:46:07.034 --> 00:46:07.700
See what I mean?

00:46:07.700 --> 00:46:09.390
Because we don't
like anxiety so we

00:46:09.390 --> 00:46:11.930
do what we can to get rid of it.

00:46:11.930 --> 00:46:16.515
And if we go back to what's
familiar, we feel less anxious,

00:46:16.515 --> 00:46:17.645
do you see what I mean?

00:46:17.645 --> 00:46:17.910
AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:46:17.910 --> 00:46:19.493
JOHN CLEESE: So I
think the only thing

00:46:19.493 --> 00:46:21.860
is if you've got a boss who
doesn't understand this,

00:46:21.860 --> 00:46:24.610
you're fucked.

00:46:24.610 --> 00:46:25.110
You know?

00:46:25.110 --> 00:46:26.910
But if the boss
understands it then

00:46:26.910 --> 00:46:30.570
they'll understand why
Einstein at Princeton

00:46:30.570 --> 00:46:34.240
was famous for sitting in
his study with his feet

00:46:34.240 --> 00:46:37.010
on the desk staring
out the window.

00:46:37.010 --> 00:46:39.050
And it was all
right for Einstein,

00:46:39.050 --> 00:46:40.720
you know, because
people always thought,

00:46:40.720 --> 00:46:43.650
oh, he's having
profound thoughts.

00:46:43.650 --> 00:46:46.470
But if you did that,
people would think,

00:46:46.470 --> 00:46:48.010
lazy person, let's fire her.

00:46:48.010 --> 00:46:48.970
You see what I mean?

00:46:48.970 --> 00:46:51.660
See, it's essential
in organizations

00:46:51.660 --> 00:46:53.990
that you have people who
understand the process,

00:46:53.990 --> 00:46:56.950
and I think because of
this constant pressure

00:46:56.950 --> 00:46:58.840
that the people in
charge frequently

00:46:58.840 --> 00:47:04.010
don't understand anxiety
makes people go along

00:47:04.010 --> 00:47:06.717
more conventional lines.

00:47:06.717 --> 00:47:07.550
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:47:07.550 --> 00:47:08.280
JOHN CLEESE: OK.

00:47:08.280 --> 00:47:10.470
So you have to find a
way of cutting yourself

00:47:10.470 --> 00:47:15.430
off and creating what I call
a space by creating boundaries

00:47:15.430 --> 00:47:18.180
of time and boundaries of space.

00:47:18.180 --> 00:47:22.220
I will now be in this-- might
be in the middle of a park,

00:47:22.220 --> 00:47:22.860
you know?

00:47:22.860 --> 00:47:24.220
I had a friend at
Cambridge used to go--

00:47:24.220 --> 00:47:26.386
he had four brothers-- he
used to go into the toilet

00:47:26.386 --> 00:47:27.990
when he wanted to think.

00:47:27.990 --> 00:47:29.885
You've got to create a
space where you're not

00:47:29.885 --> 00:47:33.490
going to be interrupted because
interruptions are absolutely

00:47:33.490 --> 00:47:35.140
fatal for creativity.

00:47:35.140 --> 00:47:38.380
And you've got to give yourself
a certain space of time.

00:47:38.380 --> 00:47:41.140
And the first thing that
happens when you sit down

00:47:41.140 --> 00:47:43.390
is you start having all
these thoughts about things

00:47:43.390 --> 00:47:46.160
you should have been doing--
should've called Frank,

00:47:46.160 --> 00:47:47.340
got to remember to buy that.

00:47:47.340 --> 00:47:48.620
You see what I mean?

00:47:48.620 --> 00:47:49.529
It's like meditation.

00:47:49.529 --> 00:47:51.070
You have to do it
for a time and then

00:47:51.070 --> 00:47:55.220
as the thoughts settle, then
slowly you get into a calmer,

00:47:55.220 --> 00:47:58.490
rather nice, relaxed
meditative state which I like,

00:47:58.490 --> 00:48:00.930
and that's where the
ideas start to come.

00:48:00.930 --> 00:48:02.240
But you can't do that.

00:48:02.240 --> 00:48:05.800
That's why I think reading Susan
Cain's book about introversion,

00:48:05.800 --> 00:48:08.917
you can't do that in
one of those offices

00:48:08.917 --> 00:48:10.500
where there's someone
every four feet.

00:48:13.220 --> 00:48:14.590
But then, who would know that?

00:48:14.590 --> 00:48:16.312
Because the people in
charge have no idea

00:48:16.312 --> 00:48:17.520
what they're doing, remember?

00:48:21.910 --> 00:48:23.010
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:48:23.010 --> 00:48:24.180
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:48:24.180 --> 00:48:26.530
I'd love to hear about
your writing process

00:48:26.530 --> 00:48:28.410
and how you think
about, you know,

00:48:28.410 --> 00:48:30.490
when you're a creating
character, just

00:48:30.490 --> 00:48:31.637
sort of like the elements.

00:48:31.637 --> 00:48:33.720
JOHN CLEESE: Well, in
creating the character, what

00:48:33.720 --> 00:48:38.740
happens after a time if
you've got a character in mind

00:48:38.740 --> 00:48:42.780
is that you start thinking would
he do this, would he do that?

00:48:42.780 --> 00:48:44.532
And you think, yes,
he would do that.

00:48:44.532 --> 00:48:45.365
Yes, yes, yes.

00:48:45.365 --> 00:48:47.365
And you think, no,
he wouldn't do that.

00:48:47.365 --> 00:48:48.930
No, that doesn't feel right.

00:48:48.930 --> 00:48:50.610
And it's like points on a graph.

00:48:50.610 --> 00:48:53.680
You begin to find points--
but, ah, he would do that.

00:48:53.680 --> 00:48:56.740
And you begin--
that he becomes more

00:48:56.740 --> 00:49:00.030
of a character in
your own mind and then

00:49:00.030 --> 00:49:04.320
I began to understand that some
novelists say sometimes they're

00:49:04.320 --> 00:49:06.260
writing a character
and he-- it's

00:49:06.260 --> 00:49:09.680
almost as though the character
they're writing becomes alive

00:49:09.680 --> 00:49:11.240
and takes the novel over.

00:49:11.240 --> 00:49:13.290
They sort of have to
follow the character.

00:49:13.290 --> 00:49:14.860
And I think that's
what happened.

00:49:14.860 --> 00:49:16.920
I think when you're
an actor doing a part

00:49:16.920 --> 00:49:19.490
and you're not just playing
a stereotypical role

00:49:19.490 --> 00:49:21.970
you've done before, you
try different things.

00:49:21.970 --> 00:49:24.330
You think, no, no.

00:49:24.330 --> 00:49:26.800
Ah, that feels right.

00:49:26.800 --> 00:49:29.930
And you slowly build
the picture up,

00:49:29.930 --> 00:49:32.550
and as the picture becomes
more comprehensive,

00:49:32.550 --> 00:49:34.570
you feel more and more
strongly that this

00:49:34.570 --> 00:49:36.550
is right for this
character and this is not

00:49:36.550 --> 00:49:38.030
right for the character.

00:49:38.030 --> 00:49:41.680
As far as my process is, what's
really different from anyone

00:49:41.680 --> 00:49:44.050
else-- because I've talked
a bit about the creativity

00:49:44.050 --> 00:49:45.800
with that young
lady we just spoke

00:49:45.800 --> 00:49:52.950
to-- what I think is so
important to do is the plot.

00:49:52.950 --> 00:49:54.922
The story is everything.

00:49:54.922 --> 00:49:56.880
I can't remember if I
mentioned William Goldman

00:49:56.880 --> 00:49:58.360
but he was a great
friend of mine

00:49:58.360 --> 00:50:01.200
and he won two Oscars
from "Butch Cassidy"

00:50:01.200 --> 00:50:02.570
and "All the President's Men."

00:50:02.570 --> 00:50:07.960
And he says if the story's
right then everything follows.

00:50:07.960 --> 00:50:10.780
And if the story
isn't quite right,

00:50:10.780 --> 00:50:13.247
then it doesn't matter how
brilliant everyone else is,

00:50:13.247 --> 00:50:14.930
it will never quite work.

00:50:14.930 --> 00:50:17.360
So I say if you're
writing a comedy--

00:50:17.360 --> 00:50:19.640
and this is
specifically comedy--

00:50:19.640 --> 00:50:22.430
get a funny story
with funny situations.

00:50:22.430 --> 00:50:24.570
Most people create
a story that's

00:50:24.570 --> 00:50:28.640
not really funny at all, only
very, very slightly funny,

00:50:28.640 --> 00:50:30.660
and then they have to
put lots of jokes in.

00:50:30.660 --> 00:50:34.300
But if you can create a story
that has funny scenes then

00:50:34.300 --> 00:50:37.800
all you have to do
is write the scenes

00:50:37.800 --> 00:50:41.090
in a reasonably authentic
way and you've got a comedy.

00:50:41.090 --> 00:50:44.930
So never-- people sit
down at their typewriter

00:50:44.930 --> 00:50:46.110
and they do scene one.

00:50:46.110 --> 00:50:47.930
You know, forget it.

00:50:47.930 --> 00:50:50.300
Connie and I, when we were
writing "Fawlty Towers,"

00:50:50.300 --> 00:50:53.200
we never started to write
dialogue until about two

00:50:53.200 --> 00:50:55.950
and a half weeks into the
process, by which time

00:50:55.950 --> 00:50:58.280
we had a big pad of
that sketch paper

00:50:58.280 --> 00:51:01.201
that you can get at artist's
materials shops and a plot

00:51:01.201 --> 00:51:03.700
because you think of an idea
and you think, where would that

00:51:03.700 --> 00:51:03.950
come?

00:51:03.950 --> 00:51:06.449
That would come about there and
then you write that in there

00:51:06.449 --> 00:51:08.430
and you get an
idea for the ending

00:51:08.430 --> 00:51:11.450
and over two and a half weeks
you've actually got a plot.

00:51:11.450 --> 00:51:13.160
And then you clean
it up a little bit

00:51:13.160 --> 00:51:15.597
and then you start writing it.

00:51:15.597 --> 00:51:16.430
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:51:16.430 --> 00:51:17.150
JOHN CLEESE: OK.

00:51:17.150 --> 00:51:18.762
Yes, sir?

00:51:18.762 --> 00:51:20.720
AUDIENCE: I think in the
beginning few chapters

00:51:20.720 --> 00:51:22.345
of your book, you
mentioned getting bit

00:51:22.345 --> 00:51:24.277
by a bunny as a
child in a garden.

00:51:24.277 --> 00:51:26.360
JOHN CLEESE: Oh, yes, I
thought it was very funny.

00:51:26.360 --> 00:51:28.240
My first experience
of being on a farm

00:51:28.240 --> 00:51:29.340
was that a rabbit bit me.

00:51:29.340 --> 00:51:32.010
AUDIENCE: So, I didn't finish
the book yet so I'm wondering--

00:51:32.010 --> 00:51:34.125
maybe you answered this-- but
does this have any inspiration

00:51:34.125 --> 00:51:34.390
for--

00:51:34.390 --> 00:51:34.950
JOHN CLEESE: I know what
you're going to ask.

00:51:34.950 --> 00:51:35.450
Did the--

00:51:35.530 --> 00:51:36.905
AUDIENCE: --for
the killer bunny?

00:51:36.905 --> 00:51:40.050
JOHN CLEESE: --when I was
writing "The Holy Grail."

00:51:40.050 --> 00:51:42.490
I don't think so.

00:51:42.490 --> 00:51:44.430
I don't think so.

00:51:44.430 --> 00:51:46.201
Let's have another
one from there.

00:51:46.201 --> 00:51:47.700
AUDIENCE: My question
would be about

00:51:47.700 --> 00:51:50.360
whether you think there
should be any limits to what

00:51:50.360 --> 00:51:53.930
is considered comedy and
what the role, if any,

00:51:53.930 --> 00:51:56.280
political correctness
should play in comedy?

00:51:56.280 --> 00:51:58.620
JOHN CLEESE: I think political
correctness started out

00:51:58.620 --> 00:52:00.700
as a very good
idea which is let's

00:52:00.700 --> 00:52:02.640
not make mean
jokes, particularly

00:52:02.640 --> 00:52:06.550
about groups that can't
look after themselves so

00:52:06.550 --> 00:52:08.180
well yet because
of their position

00:52:08.180 --> 00:52:10.700
in the socioeconomic scale.

00:52:10.700 --> 00:52:12.280
I thought it was a good idea.

00:52:12.280 --> 00:52:16.930
Then it got extended
and absurdum.

00:52:16.930 --> 00:52:19.490
And I now think it's become
quite pernicious, which

00:52:19.490 --> 00:52:22.654
is what happens with good
ideas if they're taken too far.

00:52:22.654 --> 00:52:24.070
And I think what
we've reached now

00:52:24.070 --> 00:52:27.260
is a point where
anything that seems

00:52:27.260 --> 00:52:32.010
to be the slightest bit critical
of any group or individual

00:52:32.010 --> 00:52:33.090
is out of bounds.

00:52:33.090 --> 00:52:37.380
And what people don't
understand is all humor

00:52:37.380 --> 00:52:40.590
is essentially critical.

00:52:40.590 --> 00:52:45.290
Every joke that's ever been made
is about stupidity or prejudice

00:52:45.290 --> 00:52:46.700
or something like that.

00:52:46.700 --> 00:52:47.740
You see what I mean?

00:52:47.740 --> 00:52:48.970
It's always critical.

00:52:48.970 --> 00:52:51.930
Now, this isn't harmful.

00:52:51.930 --> 00:52:54.700
I was with a
wonderful psychiatrist

00:52:54.700 --> 00:52:59.090
who said that the moment that
he knew someone in the group

00:52:59.090 --> 00:53:01.660
was getting more
healthy was they started

00:53:01.660 --> 00:53:04.320
laughing at their own behavior.

00:53:04.320 --> 00:53:07.950
It was a little daylight between
themselves and their ego.

00:53:07.950 --> 00:53:10.410
So if we can laugh
at ourselves, that

00:53:10.410 --> 00:53:13.160
can't be a particularly
cruel thing to do, can it?

00:53:13.160 --> 00:53:18.740
So to laugh at other people
when there's affection around

00:53:18.740 --> 00:53:19.380
is fine.

00:53:19.380 --> 00:53:23.530
That's what good, humorous,
affectionate teasing is about.

00:53:23.530 --> 00:53:26.700
It's about teasing people
gently and pointing things

00:53:26.700 --> 00:53:27.740
out to them.

00:53:27.740 --> 00:53:30.927
Now, when it gets nasty,
not only is it nasty,

00:53:30.927 --> 00:53:32.260
but they'll never listen to you.

00:53:32.260 --> 00:53:34.950
But if teasing is done
in an affectionate way

00:53:34.950 --> 00:53:39.430
then people can hear
the implicit criticism

00:53:39.430 --> 00:53:40.320
that's in there.

00:53:40.320 --> 00:53:42.370
And it's at an acceptable level.

00:53:42.370 --> 00:53:43.077
Is that a--

00:53:43.077 --> 00:53:44.410
AUDIENCE: Absolutely, thank you.

00:53:44.410 --> 00:53:45.256
JOHN CLEESE: Yeah?

00:53:45.256 --> 00:53:45.881
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:53:45.881 --> 00:53:48.820
I mean, I guess the
question would be like,

00:53:48.820 --> 00:53:49.860
is it a distance thing?

00:53:49.860 --> 00:53:50.950
Is it a time thing?

00:53:50.950 --> 00:53:52.575
JOHN CLEESE: Oh,
there is a time thing.

00:53:52.575 --> 00:53:53.990
That's a very good point.

00:53:53.990 --> 00:53:55.410
You're absolutely right.

00:53:55.410 --> 00:54:01.390
I mean, absolutely
right, because time

00:54:01.390 --> 00:54:04.320
ameliorates everything.

00:54:04.320 --> 00:54:06.780
I remember at
school people said,

00:54:06.780 --> 00:54:09.055
oh god, it was like the
Black Hole of Calcutta.

00:54:09.055 --> 00:54:11.180
Now, I don't suppose you've
ever heard of the Black

00:54:11.180 --> 00:54:12.554
Hole of Calcutta,
but it happened

00:54:12.554 --> 00:54:15.970
during the Indian mutiny--
the British call it

00:54:15.970 --> 00:54:20.390
and the Indians call it the
first War of Liberation.

00:54:20.390 --> 00:54:24.970
And so the Indians--
I mean, Asian Indians

00:54:24.970 --> 00:54:30.140
put some British people
into a very, very small room

00:54:30.140 --> 00:54:33.125
and there was so little space
or air that many of them

00:54:33.125 --> 00:54:33.625
suffocated.

00:54:33.625 --> 00:54:36.292
Now, that's not something
we can laugh at,

00:54:36.292 --> 00:54:38.760
but 100 years later,
people were saying

00:54:38.760 --> 00:54:41.390
it was like the Black Hole of
Calcutta, you see what I mean?

00:54:41.390 --> 00:54:46.740
So that as time goes
away, as time passes,

00:54:46.740 --> 00:54:49.950
we feel more distant so we
can make things-- rather,

00:54:49.950 --> 00:54:51.160
make things--

00:54:51.160 --> 00:54:55.740
I don't think-- well, an example
which I thought was terribly

00:54:55.740 --> 00:54:58.494
funny, was-- did I
tell them about--

00:54:58.494 --> 00:54:59.910
JASON SANDERS: I
wasn't listening.

00:54:59.910 --> 00:55:01.993
JOHN CLEESE: Yeah, well,
I've done four interviews

00:55:01.993 --> 00:55:04.450
this morning.

00:55:04.450 --> 00:55:08.050
It reminds me of my favorite
psychiatrist joke, you know?

00:55:08.050 --> 00:55:10.140
Guy says to a psychiatrist,
but how do you do it?

00:55:10.140 --> 00:55:14.260
How do you manage to sit
there all day with people

00:55:14.260 --> 00:55:18.530
moaning about their problems
and being miserable and unhappy

00:55:18.530 --> 00:55:20.680
and telling you how they
want to kill themselves,

00:55:20.680 --> 00:55:23.722
and the psychiatrist
says, who listens?

00:55:23.722 --> 00:55:26.620
[LAUGHTER]

00:55:26.620 --> 00:55:27.485
Thank you.

00:55:27.485 --> 00:55:28.860
Thank you very
much for laughing.

00:55:28.860 --> 00:55:30.530
I thought it was funny.

00:55:30.530 --> 00:55:32.050
This is a slightly
weird audience.

00:55:32.050 --> 00:55:34.260
[LAUGHTER]

00:55:34.260 --> 00:55:38.161
I never ever quite know what
you're going to laugh at.

00:55:38.161 --> 00:55:39.660
JASON SANDERS: Well,
unfortunately I

00:55:39.660 --> 00:55:40.800
think that's all
the time we have.

00:55:40.800 --> 00:55:41.450
JOHN CLEESE: Oh, all right.

00:55:41.450 --> 00:55:42.320
Nevermind.

00:55:42.320 --> 00:55:43.849
One more question.

00:55:43.849 --> 00:55:44.890
Oh, no, there's no more--

00:55:44.890 --> 00:55:46.514
JASON SANDERS: Come
up with a question.

00:55:46.514 --> 00:55:49.090
JOHN CLEESE: All I'd say
is get Neil Postman's book,

00:55:49.090 --> 00:55:53.390
"Technology," and read
something of Rupert Sheldrake

00:55:53.390 --> 00:55:57.120
because the people who
think they know everything

00:55:57.120 --> 00:55:59.220
scientifically they don't.

00:55:59.220 --> 00:55:59.979
All right.

00:55:59.979 --> 00:56:01.020
JASON SANDERS: Thank you.

00:56:01.020 --> 00:56:05.270
[APPLAUSE]
