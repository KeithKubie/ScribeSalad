00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
The answer is to improve efficiency.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:07.000
If message m is very long, RSA could be a very expensive operation,

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
so we only want to run the encryption on the hashed message,

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
which wold be smaller.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
The first option is not true.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000
The security of this scheme depends on the encryption function, not on the hash function.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.000
The third option is not true.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.000
Asymmetric decryption is necessary in both schemes.

00:00:22.000 --> 99:59:59.000
The fourth option is not true, because we haven't done anything to increase the message space.
