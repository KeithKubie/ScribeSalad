00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:01.200
What was your answer David?

00:00:01.200 --> 00:00:05.110
&gt;&gt; So means-ends analysis always
chooses the state that most

00:00:05.110 --> 00:00:08.060
reduces the distance to the goal state.

00:00:08.060 --> 00:00:10.045
In this case,
that would be the third option,

00:00:10.045 --> 00:00:12.130
because it reduces
the distance down to two.

00:00:12.130 --> 00:00:13.020
&gt;&gt; That's correct David.
