00:00:00.434 --> 00:00:01.534
[applause]

00:00:01.534 --> 00:00:02.801
Woollen: Thanks, Kevin.

00:00:02.801 --> 00:00:04.167
My name is Mark Woollen.

00:00:04.167 --> 00:00:06.400
I'm responsible for our
Social CRM products at Oracle.

00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:08.534
Today, we have
over 5 million customers

00:00:08.534 --> 00:00:11.100
using our CRM applications
all around the world.

00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:14.000
Now our customers
do use a large variety

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:15.801
of personal productivity tools.

00:00:15.801 --> 00:00:17.601
And they're also
always looking

00:00:17.601 --> 00:00:19.267
for open standards-based ways

00:00:19.267 --> 00:00:21.234
that they can connect
their Oracle data

00:00:21.234 --> 00:00:23.701
to the growing set
of third party applications

00:00:23.701 --> 00:00:25.200
that reside in the cloud.

00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:26.734
Now the Google
Secure Data Connector

00:00:26.734 --> 00:00:28.267
helps us solve this problem.

00:00:28.267 --> 00:00:29.734
If you look at the slide
over here,

00:00:29.734 --> 00:00:31.901
what you'll see is the Google
Secure Data Connector

00:00:31.901 --> 00:00:33.934
interacting with
a Siebel CRM server

00:00:33.934 --> 00:00:35.634
that sits behind
the firewall.

00:00:35.634 --> 00:00:37.767
and it's doing this
via Siebel's REST APIs.

00:00:37.767 --> 00:00:41.200
And all of this then powers
a user experience in the cloud.

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:43.300
Let's take a look now
at some live code

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:46.133
that'll show us how we can use
the Secure Data Connector

00:00:46.133 --> 00:00:47.934
in conjunction with Siebel.

00:00:47.934 --> 00:00:49.734
And as we do this,
we'll do it in the context

00:00:49.734 --> 00:00:51.968
of a channel sale scenario.

00:00:51.968 --> 00:00:55.200
Now as a channel sales rep,
typically to get

00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:57.133
even the most basic information
like my leads,

00:00:57.133 --> 00:00:59.801
I have to log into
a large enterprise application.

00:00:59.801 --> 00:01:01.767
Instead,
what you see here today

00:01:01.767 --> 00:01:04.367
is a streamlined,
personalized home page

00:01:04.367 --> 00:01:06.367
comprised of a series
of gadgets.

00:01:06.367 --> 00:01:09.400
Now this home page
is actually a Google site.

00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:11.767
A Google site
is basically a gadget container,

00:01:11.767 --> 00:01:14.467
but what it does
is it houses private gadgets.

00:01:14.467 --> 00:01:17.467
So it meets the critical
user access security needs

00:01:17.467 --> 00:01:19.434
for IT
in a business environment.

00:01:19.434 --> 00:01:21.100
Now as a salesperson,

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:23.100
these gadgets provide me
with very useful information

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:24.901
in a very simple manner.

00:01:24.901 --> 00:01:26.467
So all the critical
information I need--

00:01:26.467 --> 00:01:28.868
my leads, my customers
I'm calling on, et cetera--

00:01:28.868 --> 00:01:30.567
are all pulled
into these gadgets

00:01:30.567 --> 00:01:33.467
from the Siebel CRM server
that sits behind the firewall.

00:01:33.467 --> 00:01:35.434
Now we're able to do this

00:01:35.434 --> 00:01:37.601
because the appropriate
access control list

00:01:37.601 --> 00:01:40.133
had been defined on
the secure data connector agent.

00:01:40.133 --> 00:01:42.167
This allows me then,
as a result,

00:01:42.167 --> 00:01:44.167
to use a standard
Google Apps account

00:01:44.167 --> 00:01:45.567
to access this information

00:01:45.567 --> 00:01:47.968
as you can see here
in the upper right-hand side.

00:01:47.968 --> 00:01:49.267
Now what's really great

00:01:49.267 --> 00:01:51.100
is not only can I view
the information,

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:52.767
I can interact with it
as well.

00:01:52.767 --> 00:01:54.534
So again, in a channel sales
environment,

00:01:54.534 --> 00:01:56.200
the business partners
I work with

00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:57.567
may forward leads to me,

00:01:57.567 --> 00:01:59.133
leads that I may choose
to reject

00:01:59.133 --> 00:02:00.767
or in some cases accept.

00:02:00.767 --> 00:02:02.400
And I may say that this deal
here at Erikson

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:04.133
looks like one I'd like
to take on my own.

00:02:04.133 --> 00:02:05.834
I'm gonna register
this deal.

00:02:05.834 --> 00:02:07.667
I can simply select it,
hit the "submit" button,

00:02:07.667 --> 00:02:09.167
and now this is my deal.

00:02:09.167 --> 00:02:11.300
I'm gonna work this deal
and try and drive it to closure.

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:13.367
Now the Secure Data Connector

00:02:13.367 --> 00:02:15.367
has the ability
to provide access

00:02:15.367 --> 00:02:16.868
to a number
of cloud-based resources,

00:02:16.868 --> 00:02:18.200
not just these gadgets.

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:20.000
So let's continue
the demonstration here

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:21.567
by showing how we can use
a Google Spreadsheet

00:02:21.567 --> 00:02:24.200
to collaborate
on deal pricing.

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:25.968
Now just like
Kevin showed you earlier,

00:02:25.968 --> 00:02:27.367
this is a Google Spreadsheet,

00:02:27.367 --> 00:02:28.901
very simple, very
straightforward.

00:02:28.901 --> 00:02:30.534
What we're doing here though
is we're loading information

00:02:30.534 --> 00:02:34.200
from a Siebel CRM server
that sits behind the firewall.

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:36.167
Now as a salesperson,
this is useful to me,

00:02:36.167 --> 00:02:37.734
because one of the things
I might have to do

00:02:37.734 --> 00:02:39.234
to close this deal
at Erikson

00:02:39.234 --> 00:02:41.467
is take pricing information
from behind the firewall

00:02:41.467 --> 00:02:43.234
but use it
in a collaborative manner

00:02:43.234 --> 00:02:44.534
with other people,
other parties,

00:02:44.534 --> 00:02:45.868
to close the business.

00:02:45.868 --> 00:02:47.534
Again, we're able to do this

00:02:47.534 --> 00:02:49.667
because the very same account
we used to view the gadgets,

00:02:49.667 --> 00:02:51.601
my mwoollen@testoracle.com
account,

00:02:51.601 --> 00:02:53.133
that Google Apps account,

00:02:53.133 --> 00:02:55.501
you've already granted access
to view this information

00:02:55.501 --> 00:02:57.167
on the SDC agent.

00:02:57.167 --> 00:02:58.667
What this then does

00:02:58.667 --> 00:03:00.467
is dynamically
and in real time,

00:03:00.467 --> 00:03:02.734
it pulls the information in
from the Siebel CRM server

00:03:02.734 --> 00:03:04.734
on products
and the prices,

00:03:04.734 --> 00:03:06.534
and it then allows me
as a salesperson

00:03:06.534 --> 00:03:08.534
to use this information
to collaborate with other people

00:03:08.534 --> 00:03:10.467
and hopefully close
this business.

00:03:10.467 --> 00:03:12.501
The result, critical
sales leads in pricing

00:03:12.501 --> 00:03:14.100
for a specific user

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:16.367
from a Siebel CRM server
that's behind the firewall

00:03:16.367 --> 00:03:19.834
are securely tunneled through
to the spreadsheet.

00:03:19.834 --> 00:03:21.334
So just to recap,

00:03:21.334 --> 00:03:23.000
there's really
three things I've showed you.

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:25.667
Number one was a set
of very simple private gadgets,

00:03:25.667 --> 00:03:28.501
and again, private gadgets
that allow you to control

00:03:28.501 --> 00:03:30.167
the security
in a business environment.

00:03:30.167 --> 00:03:31.501
Unlike maybe the public gadgets

00:03:31.501 --> 00:03:33.200
we've seen pop up
on the web everywhere.

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:34.901
Number two,
we've used these gadgets

00:03:34.901 --> 00:03:36.701
combined with the
Secure Data Connector

00:03:36.701 --> 00:03:38.701
to provide a simple,
personalized user experience

00:03:38.701 --> 00:03:41.534
based on consuming information
from a Siebel CRM server

00:03:41.534 --> 00:03:43.501
behind the firewall.

00:03:43.501 --> 00:03:46.067
Number three,
this data that we consumed

00:03:46.067 --> 00:03:48.133
is interactive,
available in real time,

00:03:48.133 --> 00:03:50.267
and it can be shared
amongst a number

00:03:50.267 --> 00:03:52.133
of cloud-based
applications and resources,

00:03:52.133 --> 00:03:53.834
including the Google App
engine.

00:03:53.834 --> 00:03:55.467
And from a user point of view,

00:03:55.467 --> 00:03:57.467
it gives me all the security
I need around my data,

00:03:57.467 --> 00:03:59.000
but it also gives me
the ease of use

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:01.501
and flexibility
in collaborating and sharing it.

00:04:01.501 --> 00:04:03.601
Secure Data Connector
for Oracle Siebel CRM

00:04:03.601 --> 00:04:06.033
is gonna be available
in May of 2009.

00:04:06.033 --> 00:04:08.167
We're working on using
the Secure Data Connector

00:04:08.167 --> 00:04:09.834
with a variety
of our other applications

00:04:09.834 --> 00:04:12.167
in the HCM and the supply chain
space at Oracle.

00:04:12.167 --> 00:04:13.834
And for those
Siebel CRM customers

00:04:13.834 --> 00:04:15.267
that want
to take advantage of this

00:04:15.267 --> 00:04:16.501
prior to its availability
in May,

00:04:16.501 --> 00:04:19.100
you can do that
as part of our beta program.
