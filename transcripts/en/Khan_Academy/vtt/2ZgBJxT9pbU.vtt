00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:04.030
What I want to do in this video
is answer an age-old question,

00:00:04.030 --> 00:00:06.630
or at least an interesting
question to me.

00:00:06.630 --> 00:00:10.280
And the question is, let's
say I have a ledge here--

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:12.510
I have a ledge or
cliff, or maybe

00:00:12.510 --> 00:00:14.630
this is a building of some kind.

00:00:14.630 --> 00:00:17.230
And let's say it has height, h.

00:00:17.230 --> 00:00:21.970
So let's say it has a height
of h, right over here.

00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:25.480
And what I'm curious about is
if I were to either-- Let's

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:29.690
say that this is me over
here, so this is me.

00:00:29.690 --> 00:00:32.560
If I were to either
jump, myself--

00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:35.310
that's not recommended
for very large h's.

00:00:35.310 --> 00:00:38.530
Or If I were to throw something,
maybe a rock off of this

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:42.530
ledge, how fast would
either myself or that rock

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:48.110
be going right before
it hits the ground?

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:49.980
And like all of the
other videos we're

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:52.110
doing on projectile
motion right now,

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:54.490
we're going to ignore
air resistance.

00:00:54.490 --> 00:00:57.390
And for small h's and
for small velocities,

00:00:57.390 --> 00:00:59.200
that's actually reasonable.

00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:02.250
Or if the object
is very aerodynamic

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:04.200
and is kind of dense,
then the air resistance

00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:05.220
will matter less.

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:08.110
If it's me kind of belly
flopping from a high altitude,

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:10.840
then the air resistance
will start to matter a lot.

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:15.670
But for the sake of simplicity,
we're going to assume no air.

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:17.650
Or we're not going
to take into effect

00:01:17.650 --> 00:01:19.382
the effects of air resistance.

00:01:19.382 --> 00:01:20.840
Or we could assume
that we're doing

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:24.380
this on an Earth-like planet
that has no atmosphere.

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:25.480
However you want to do it.

00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:27.100
So let's just think
about the problem.

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:28.730
And just so you know,
some of you might say,

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:29.670
that's not realistic.

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:32.410
But this actually would be
realistic for a small h.

00:01:32.410 --> 00:01:35.920
If you were to jump off of the
roof of a one-story building,

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:37.922
air resistance will not
be a major component

00:01:37.922 --> 00:01:39.130
in determining your speed if.

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:41.620
It was to be a much larger
building, then all of a sudden

00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:42.120
it matters.

00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:43.800
And I don't recommend you
do any of these things.

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:45.300
Those are all very
dangerous things.

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:46.700
Much better to do
it with a rock.

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:49.490
So that's actually the example
we're going to be considering.

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:52.190
So let's just think
about this a little bit.

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:56.474
We want to figure
out-- So at the top,

00:01:56.474 --> 00:01:57.890
right when the
thing gets dropped,

00:01:57.890 --> 00:01:59.540
right when the
rock gets dropped,

00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:05.021
you have an initial
velocity of 0.

00:02:05.021 --> 00:02:07.270
And once again, we're going
to use the convention here

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:11.120
that positive velocity
means upwards,

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:16.230
or a positive vector means up,
a negative vector means down.

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:18.650
So we're going to have an
initial velocity over here

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:19.630
of 0.

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:21.720
And then at the
bottom we're going

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:30.650
to have some final
velocity here that

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:33.400
is going to be a
negative number.

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:36.680
So it's going to have some
negative value over here.

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:39.290
So this is going to be negative.

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:43.340
This is going to be a negative
number right over there.

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:46.070
And we know that the
acceleration of gravity

00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:49.400
for an object on free
fall, an object in free

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:51.580
fall near the
surface of the earth.

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:54.500
We know it, and we're going
to assume that it's constant.

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:56.740
So our constant
acceleration is going

00:02:56.740 --> 00:03:01.440
to be negative 9.8 meters
per second squared.

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:03.380
So what we're going
to do is given an h,

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:05.480
and given that their
initial velocity is 0

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:07.810
and that our acceleration
is negative 9.8 meters per

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:11.870
squared, we want to figure
out what our final velocity is

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:14.120
going to be right before
we hit the ground.

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:15.640
We're going to
assume that this h is

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:17.120
given in meters,
right over here.

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:18.495
And we'll get an
answer in meters

00:03:18.495 --> 00:03:20.390
per second for that
final velocity.

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:22.190
So let's see how we
can figure it out.

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:24.703
So we know some basic things.

00:03:24.703 --> 00:03:26.786
And the whole point of
these is to really show you

00:03:26.786 --> 00:03:29.680
that you can always derive
these more interesting questions

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:32.410
from very basic
things that we know.

00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:41.450
So we know that displacement is
equal to average velocity times

00:03:41.450 --> 00:03:42.270
change in time.

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:48.510
And we know that
average velocity--

00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:50.690
if we assume
acceleration is constant,

00:03:50.690 --> 00:03:53.090
which we are doing--
average velocity

00:03:53.090 --> 00:04:01.770
is the final velocity plus
the initial velocity over 2.

00:04:01.770 --> 00:04:06.940
And then our change in time,
the amount of elapsed time

00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:10.940
that goes by-- this is
our change in velocity.

00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:12.750
So elapsed time
is the same thing.

00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:16.870
I write it over here--
is our change in velocity

00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:20.160
divided by our acceleration.

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:22.120
And just to make sure
you understand this,

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:24.230
it just comes
straight from the idea

00:04:24.230 --> 00:04:26.300
that acceleration-- or
let me write it this way--

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:32.280
that change in velocity is
just acceleration times time.

00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:36.310
Or I should say, acceleration
times change in time.

00:04:36.310 --> 00:04:39.780
So if you divide both sides of
this equation by acceleration,

00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:42.107
you get this right over here.

00:04:42.107 --> 00:04:43.940
So that is what our
displacement-- Remember,

00:04:43.940 --> 00:04:45.830
I want an expression
for displacement

00:04:45.830 --> 00:04:48.040
in terms of the things
we know and the one

00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:50.180
thing that we want to find out.

00:04:50.180 --> 00:04:55.240
Well, for this example
right over here,

00:04:55.240 --> 00:04:56.490
we know a couple of things.

00:04:56.490 --> 00:04:58.680
Well actually, let me
take it step by step.

00:04:58.680 --> 00:05:00.585
We know that our
initial velocity is 0.

00:05:03.130 --> 00:05:06.290
So this first expression
for the example we're doing,

00:05:06.290 --> 00:05:10.760
the average velocity is going
to be our final velocity divided

00:05:10.760 --> 00:05:13.270
by 2, since our
initial velocity is 0.

00:05:13.270 --> 00:05:19.480
Our change in velocity
is the same thing

00:05:19.480 --> 00:05:22.420
as final velocity
minus initial velocity.

00:05:25.070 --> 00:05:28.489
And once again, we know that
the initial velocity is 0 here.

00:05:28.489 --> 00:05:30.280
So our change in velocity
is the same thing

00:05:30.280 --> 00:05:32.040
as our final velocity.

00:05:32.040 --> 00:05:33.589
So once again,
this will be times.

00:05:33.589 --> 00:05:35.380
Instead of writing
change in velocity here,

00:05:35.380 --> 00:05:37.624
we could just write
our final velocity

00:05:37.624 --> 00:05:38.790
because we're starting at 0.

00:05:38.790 --> 00:05:39.930
Initial velocity is 0.

00:05:39.930 --> 00:05:46.421
So times our final velocity
divided by our acceleration.

00:05:46.421 --> 00:05:48.670
Final velocity is the same
thing as change in velocity

00:05:48.670 --> 00:05:51.230
because initial velocity was 0.

00:05:51.230 --> 00:05:56.080
And all of this is going
to be our displacement.

00:05:56.080 --> 00:05:59.460
And now it looks like
we have everything

00:05:59.460 --> 00:06:01.040
written in things we know.

00:06:01.040 --> 00:06:04.270
So if we multiply both
sides of this expression

00:06:04.270 --> 00:06:11.620
or both sides of this equation
by 2 times our acceleration

00:06:11.620 --> 00:06:12.840
on that side.

00:06:12.840 --> 00:06:14.300
And we multiply
the left-hand side

00:06:14.300 --> 00:06:18.300
by-- I'll do the same colors--
2 times our acceleration.

00:06:21.720 --> 00:06:27.140
On the left hand side, we
get 2 times our acceleration

00:06:27.140 --> 00:06:35.070
times our displacement
is going to be equal to,

00:06:35.070 --> 00:06:38.084
on the right hand side, the
2 cancels out with the 2,

00:06:38.084 --> 00:06:40.250
the acceleration cancels
out with the acceleration--

00:06:40.250 --> 00:06:42.410
it will be equal
to the velocity,

00:06:42.410 --> 00:06:43.920
our final velocity squared.

00:06:49.280 --> 00:06:52.480
Final velocity times
final velocity.

00:06:52.480 --> 00:06:56.380
And so we can just solve
for final velocity here.

00:06:56.380 --> 00:07:01.090
So we know our acceleration
is negative 9.8 meters

00:07:01.090 --> 00:07:02.840
per second squared.

00:07:02.840 --> 00:07:04.750
So let me write this over here.

00:07:04.750 --> 00:07:07.450
So this is negative 9.8.

00:07:07.450 --> 00:07:10.870
So we have 2 times
negative 9.8--

00:07:10.870 --> 00:07:12.290
let me just multiply that out.

00:07:12.290 --> 00:07:19.080
So that's negative 19.6
meters per second squared.

00:07:19.080 --> 00:07:21.640
And then what's our
displacement going to be?

00:07:21.640 --> 00:07:23.470
What's the displacement
over the course

00:07:23.470 --> 00:07:27.534
of dropping this rock off of
this ledge or off of this roof?

00:07:27.534 --> 00:07:29.950
So you might be tempted to say
that our displacement is h.

00:07:29.950 --> 00:07:32.010
But remember, these
are vector quantities,

00:07:32.010 --> 00:07:34.540
so you want to make sure
you get the direction right.

00:07:34.540 --> 00:07:39.080
From where the rock started to
where it ends, what's it doing?

00:07:39.080 --> 00:07:41.470
It's going to go
a distance of h,

00:07:41.470 --> 00:07:44.210
but it's going to go a
distance of h downwards.

00:07:44.210 --> 00:07:48.170
And our convention
is down is negative.

00:07:48.170 --> 00:07:52.150
So in this example,
our displacement

00:07:52.150 --> 00:07:55.730
from when it leaves your hand
to when it hits the ground,

00:07:55.730 --> 00:07:58.800
the displacement is going
to be equal to negative h.

00:07:58.800 --> 00:08:00.600
It's going to travel
a distance of h,

00:08:00.600 --> 00:08:02.996
but it's going to travel
that distance downwards.

00:08:02.996 --> 00:08:05.370
And that's why this vector
notion is very important here.

00:08:05.370 --> 00:08:07.610
Our convention is
very important here.

00:08:07.610 --> 00:08:14.690
So our displacement over here is
going to be negative h meters.

00:08:17.730 --> 00:08:19.270
So this is the
variable, and this

00:08:19.270 --> 00:08:20.640
is the shorthand for meters.

00:08:20.640 --> 00:08:22.630
So when you multiply
these two things out,

00:08:22.630 --> 00:08:24.930
lucky for us these
negatives cancel out,

00:08:24.930 --> 00:08:37.330
and you get 19.6h meters squared
per second squared is equal

00:08:37.330 --> 00:08:39.535
to our final velocity squared.

00:08:44.219 --> 00:08:45.760
And notice, when
you square something

00:08:45.760 --> 00:08:47.130
you lose the sign information.

00:08:47.130 --> 00:08:49.359
If our final velocity was
positive, you square it,

00:08:49.359 --> 00:08:50.650
you still get a positive value.

00:08:50.650 --> 00:08:52.191
If it was negative
and you square it,

00:08:52.191 --> 00:08:53.521
you still get a positive value.

00:08:53.521 --> 00:08:55.020
But remember, in
this example, we're

00:08:55.020 --> 00:08:56.270
going to be moving downward.

00:08:56.270 --> 00:08:58.350
So we want the negative
version of this.

00:08:58.350 --> 00:09:01.000
So to really figure
out our final velocity,

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:03.640
we take, essentially,
the negative square root

00:09:03.640 --> 00:09:07.480
of both sides of this equation.

00:09:07.480 --> 00:09:10.380
So if we were to take the square
root of both sides of this,

00:09:10.380 --> 00:09:12.000
you take the square
root of that side,

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:14.330
you take the square root of
that side, you will get--

00:09:14.330 --> 00:09:21.870
and I'll flip them around-- your
final velocity, we could say,

00:09:21.870 --> 00:09:25.444
is equal to the
square root of 19.6h.

00:09:25.444 --> 00:09:27.860
And you can even take the
square root of the meter squared

00:09:27.860 --> 00:09:30.590
per second squared, treat
them almost like variables,

00:09:30.590 --> 00:09:31.700
even though they're units.

00:09:31.700 --> 00:09:33.241
And then outside of
the radical sign,

00:09:33.241 --> 00:09:35.616
you will get a
meters per second.

00:09:35.616 --> 00:09:37.240
And the thing I want
to be careful here

00:09:37.240 --> 00:09:39.031
is if we just take the
principal root here,

00:09:39.031 --> 00:09:41.600
the principal root here is
the positive square root.

00:09:41.600 --> 00:09:44.180
But we know that our velocity
is going to be downwards here,

00:09:44.180 --> 00:09:45.930
because that is our convention.

00:09:45.930 --> 00:09:50.627
So we want to make sure we
get the negative square root.

00:09:50.627 --> 00:09:52.210
So let's try it out
with some numbers.

00:09:52.210 --> 00:09:54.230
We've essentially
solved what we set out

00:09:54.230 --> 00:09:56.460
to solve at the
beginning of this video,

00:09:56.460 --> 00:09:59.997
how fast would we be falling,
as a function of the height.

00:09:59.997 --> 00:10:01.580
Well, let's try it
out with something.

00:10:01.580 --> 00:10:03.910
So let's say that the
height is-- I don't know,

00:10:03.910 --> 00:10:09.550
let's say the height
is 5 meters, which

00:10:09.550 --> 00:10:12.400
would be probably
jumping off of a

00:10:12.400 --> 00:10:14.910
or throwing a rock off
of a one-story, maybe

00:10:14.910 --> 00:10:18.270
a commercial one-story building.

00:10:18.270 --> 00:10:20.730
That's about 5 meters,
would be about 15 feet.

00:10:20.730 --> 00:10:23.170
So yeah, about the roof
of a commercial building,

00:10:23.170 --> 00:10:24.850
give or take.

00:10:24.850 --> 00:10:27.090
So let's turn it on.

00:10:27.090 --> 00:10:28.470
And so what do we get?

00:10:28.470 --> 00:10:38.420
If we put 5 meters in here, we
get 19.6 times 5 gives us 98.

00:10:38.420 --> 00:10:41.070
So almost 100.

00:10:41.070 --> 00:10:43.610
And then, we want to take
the square root of that,

00:10:43.610 --> 00:10:45.140
so it's going to be almost 10.

00:10:45.140 --> 00:10:51.020
So the square root of
98 gives us roughly 9.9.

00:10:51.020 --> 00:10:53.330
And we want the negative
square root of that.

00:10:53.330 --> 00:10:56.410
in that situation, when
the height is 5 meters-- So

00:10:56.410 --> 00:10:59.492
if you jump off of a
one-story commercial building,

00:10:59.492 --> 00:11:01.950
right at the bottom, or if you
throw a rock off that, right

00:11:01.950 --> 00:11:03.908
at the bottom, right
before it hits the ground,

00:11:03.908 --> 00:11:11.160
it will have a velocity of
negative 9.9 meters per second.

00:11:11.160 --> 00:11:15.590
So negative 9.9
meters per second.

00:11:15.590 --> 00:11:17.650
I'll leave it up to
you, as an exercise,

00:11:17.650 --> 00:11:20.020
to figure out how fast
this is either kilometers

00:11:20.020 --> 00:11:23.490
per hour or miles per hour
because it's pretty fast.

00:11:23.490 --> 00:11:24.990
It's not something
you's want to do.

00:11:24.990 --> 00:11:26.550
And this is just off of
a one-story building.

00:11:26.550 --> 00:11:28.170
But you can usually
figure this out.

00:11:28.170 --> 00:11:30.250
You could use this for,
really, any height as

00:11:30.250 --> 00:11:33.370
long as we're reasonably close
to the surface of the earth

00:11:33.370 --> 00:11:35.820
and you ignore the
effects of air resistance.

00:11:35.820 --> 00:11:38.280
At really high heights,
especially if the object is not

00:11:38.280 --> 00:11:40.380
that aerodynamic,
then air resistance

00:11:40.380 --> 00:11:42.930
will start to matter a lot.
