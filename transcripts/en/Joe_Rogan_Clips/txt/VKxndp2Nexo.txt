Speaker 1:          00:00          Tweet, like first of all, what is it about Nigerians that do so well in this country? That's one of the things, if you look at like Nigerian immigrants, like successful ratios of, of different immigration groups. Nigerians in particular are extraordinarily successful upon immigrating to America. I think it's a family. A family thing is like when, when your family's decided and we get the opportunity to move to a better place, right? The thing is that the whole persona is we're going to be able to sustain this forever. So my kids are not going to just play around in sports. Cause that's not guarantee. What is guaranteed is the fact that you're going to go to school and you're gonna become a doctor because you're going to get a job anywhere world that you want. That's why majority of them are doctors, right? Majority of doctors engineered because these are jobs that high demand jobs.

Speaker 1:          00:47          You always going to get a job anywhere. Yeah. And so that's all. That's all we push. You're going to be a doctor or are you going to be a a Nigeria? I'm an engineer. None of them are saying, you're going to be a professional athlete. My parents, hell no. They didn't care for that. Like I lied to them the first couple of years that I was wrestling. I didn't tell him that. You know, my brother is a doctorate in pharmacy in Dallas. My little brother, you know, could have gotten the NFL who was a s l a football player played at University of Houston and University of Arizona. You know, my sister now is in college. She's in nursing school in college. Like that's just what we push. We want you to get a job that you can provide for your family forever. Yeah. They remind me of Koreans and a lot of ways.

Speaker 1:          01:31          Absolutely. Yeah. Super hardworking and appreciate once they've gotten to a place like America where there really is no ceiling on the possibility. You could do anything you want once you get here, if you work hard. Absolutely. And then this is, that's another thing that's dear to my heart is one of your Nigeria, like when you're in a situation that we were sad, my mom was a teacher. My mom owned a store to to a little convenience store there and we did little jobs on the side were told certain things on the side and on top of it raising three boys, rowdy boys like that. That's what we, and in the school we did, it wasn't like, oh there's the card. The bus is going to pick you up at three 7:00 AM to go to school. Nah, the school was two miles away. Three miles away.

Speaker 1:          02:19          You walk in, you got get going. Don't be late cause if you got, if he was late he was going to get a whooping before school started. That's how it was and especially the education system is so high because you miss, you miss a couple of answers on the tests. You had to go out and get a sweat and you are going to get whipped in school for the answers that you missed. That would be you in school. Yeah, absolutely. The teacher, the teacher, the teacher was on, first of all, it's not teacher, his uncle and aunt, that's your uncle and your aunt in school. They knew your parents did to your family. They were going to whip you in school if you decided to, to mess up. And that's how it was. So that's why there's a lot of these smart Nigerians. They'd get out and if there is no freaking job or we've got to somehow make money, it's so fucked up cause I don't want people to beat kids, but God damn when you put kids under that kind of pressure, my parents put me in Catholic school for one year and I got excellent grades and afterwards I was fucking terrible, terrible man.

Speaker 1:          03:20          And I remember my stepfather said something to me, he said, your grades were only good when you were in Catholic school. I was like, this guy was fucking terrified down. I'm like, I'm like, it ain't a good move. I mean, it's like they were threatening me all the time. They wanted to beat me and make me sit on a nail in the closet.
