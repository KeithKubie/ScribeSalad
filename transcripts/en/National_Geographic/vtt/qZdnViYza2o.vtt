00:00:01.433 --> 00:00:02.734
BRADLEY WHITFORD: I want
to know why there aren't

00:00:02.734 --> 00:00:04.934
more Republicans in
Congress willing to come

00:00:04.934 --> 00:00:07.400
forward on climate.

00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:09.000
So I'm going to
meet the GOP's most

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.500
outspoken critic, Democratic
Senator Sheldon Whitehouse.

00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:14.333
SHELDON WHITEHOUSE: I
am back to again urge

00:00:14.333 --> 00:00:17.834
my colleagues to wake
up to the stark reality

00:00:17.834 --> 00:00:19.433
of climate change.

00:00:19.433 --> 00:00:22.133
BRADLEY WHITFORD: Nearly every
week for the last four years,

00:00:22.133 --> 00:00:24.300
Whitehouse has taken
to the Senate floor.

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:25.934
SHELDON WHITEHOUSE: I
am here today for now

00:00:25.934 --> 00:00:29.367
the 50th time, 64th, 73rd.

00:00:29.367 --> 00:00:30.700
I'm going to keep doing this.

00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:33.633
I'm never going to walk
away from this issue.

00:00:33.633 --> 00:00:38.133
Today is my 103rd,
107th, 145th time.

00:00:38.133 --> 00:00:39.667
Hi.

00:00:39.667 --> 00:00:43.000
If this is uncomfortable for
my colleagues, I apologize.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:44.367
But basically, I don't

00:00:44.367 --> 00:00:45.667
BRADLEY WHITFORD: Care.

00:00:45.667 --> 00:00:47.367
Whitehouse pulls no
punches when it comes

00:00:47.367 --> 00:00:48.967
to calling out Republicans.

00:00:48.967 --> 00:00:51.500
SHELDON WHITEHOUSE: They'd just
as soon wash their hands of it.

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:53.133
BRADLEY WHITFORD: For
being the last remaining

00:00:53.133 --> 00:00:55.500
conservative party
on Earth to deny

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:57.333
the science of climate change.

00:00:57.333 --> 00:00:59.266
SHELDON WHITEHOUSE: It is time.

00:00:59.266 --> 00:01:03.400
It is well past time.

00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:04.834
BRADLEY WHITFORD:
Like a lot of people,

00:01:04.834 --> 00:01:07.600
this situation drives me nuts.

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:09.934
That what should not
be a partisan issue

00:01:09.934 --> 00:01:12.467
has become a partisan issue.

00:01:12.467 --> 00:01:14.367
SHELDON WHITEHOUSE: But it
really isn't a partisan issue.

00:01:14.367 --> 00:01:17.033
You've got to look
behind the partisanship

00:01:17.033 --> 00:01:18.633
and see who's
pulling the strings.

00:01:18.633 --> 00:01:23.934
The truly evil story is what the
fossil fuel industry is doing.

00:01:23.934 --> 00:01:28.200
They've taken power centers
of the Republican Party

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:29.767
and grabbed them all.

00:01:29.767 --> 00:01:32.567
And if they pull their support
from a Republican candidate,

00:01:32.567 --> 00:01:34.700
that's a very serious threat.

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:36.567
BRADLEY WHITFORD: Do you
see any Republicans who want

00:01:36.567 --> 00:01:38.333
to do the right thing on this?

00:01:38.333 --> 00:01:41.500
SHELDON WHITEHOUSE: I would say
12 to 20 Republican senators

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:43.734
would like to be
involved in a serious

00:01:43.734 --> 00:01:46.967
piece of climate legislation,
and feel they can't.

00:01:46.967 --> 00:01:50.100
Talking to Republican
senators about climate change

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:53.934
is like talking to
prisoners about escape.

00:01:53.934 --> 00:01:55.266
They look around.

00:01:55.266 --> 00:01:56.934
And the whole
conversation is how

00:01:56.934 --> 00:02:00.100
are we going to get safely over
the fence or under the fence.

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:01.233
Have you've got a tunnel?

00:02:01.233 --> 00:02:02.533
These are people
who've got essentially

00:02:02.533 --> 00:02:04.000
a political gun to their heads.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:05.533
BRADLEY WHITFORD: Right.

00:02:05.533 --> 00:02:06.433
SHELDON WHITEHOUSE: And they
are being told, you do this

00:02:06.433 --> 00:02:07.667
and it's a career ender.

00:02:07.667 --> 00:02:08.734
BRADLEY WHITFORD:
Do you see any hope?

00:02:08.734 --> 00:02:09.500
Any daylight there?

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:10.734
SHELDON WHITEHOUSE: A lot.

00:02:10.734 --> 00:02:12.533
What I'm buoyed by
is the conversations

00:02:12.533 --> 00:02:15.166
from Republican senators saying,
I know I can't get there yet.

00:02:15.166 --> 00:02:16.567
But keep doing
what you're doing.

00:02:16.567 --> 00:02:18.233
BRADLEY WHITFORD: What
does it take to turn them?

00:02:18.233 --> 00:02:19.333
SHELDON WHITEHOUSE:
Safe passage.

00:02:19.333 --> 00:02:21.000
Some form of safe passage.

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.767
BRADLEY WHITFORD: I'm amazed by
what Whitehouse is telling me.

00:02:23.767 --> 00:02:25.967
Despite the threat of
the fossil fuel lobby,

00:02:25.967 --> 00:02:28.367
there may be enough
Republican votes in the Senate

00:02:28.367 --> 00:02:30.433
to pass a climate bill.
