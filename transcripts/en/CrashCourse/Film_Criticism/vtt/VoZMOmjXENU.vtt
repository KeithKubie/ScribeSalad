00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:07.910
While it’s easy to love a straight-up superhero
movie or car chase flick, not all films fit

00:00:07.910 --> 00:00:09.200
neatly into one genre.

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:11.260
Take the Alien series, for instance.

00:00:11.260 --> 00:00:15.130
You’ve got some sci-fi thriller movies with
action and horror elements thrown in.

00:00:15.130 --> 00:00:20.540
And, not to mention, a protagonist who arguably
helped pioneer the trope of a “strong female character.”

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:24.700
In this episode, we’re gonna focus on the
second film in the series, James Cameron’s

00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:27.840
Aliens—the theatrical cut, not the extended
special edition.

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:32.000
With its carefully-crafted plot points and
ensemble cast of characters, this sci-fi action

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:33.630
classic rewards a deeper look.

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:37.810
On the one hand, you can think about Aliens
as a war movie, and unpack the battle between

00:00:37.810 --> 00:00:41.510
human Marines and vicious aliens through a
racial and cultural lens.

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:42.969
Whether or not that’s what Cameron intended.

00:00:42.969 --> 00:00:46.190
Or you can look at it as an action movie,
and analyze Ellen Ripley as a hero through

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:47.359
a feminist lens.

00:00:47.359 --> 00:00:50.230
Because her character is part of what’s
really special about this film, both for fans

00:00:50.230 --> 00:00:51.469
and historically in cinema.

00:00:51.469 --> 00:00:55.500
I’m Michael Aranda, and this is Crash Course
Film Criticism.

00:00:55.500 --> 00:01:07.740
[intro music plays]

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:15.540
The original Alien came out in 1979. Directed by Ridley Scott, it’s slow, methodical, and spooky—a horror movie in space.

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:20.540
Whereas Aliens is a different kind of film—an
intense war movie… in space.

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:24.940
Alien starred Sigourney Weaver as Ellen Ripley,
a space trucker whose crew responds to a distress

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:30.260
call that brings them to LV-426, a desolate
planet with an alien life form that incubates

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:31.420
inside humans.

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:36.170
Through her smarts and tenacity, Ripley survives,
blows the alien into space, and seals herself

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:38.540
into a hypersleep pod with her cat, Jones.

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:43.030
Because Alien straddles the science fiction
and horror genres, Ripley’s sort of a combination

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:46.660
of an action hero and the “final girl”
movie trope.

00:01:46.660 --> 00:01:49.900
The term “final girl” was first used by
the film scholar Carol J. Clover to describe

00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:51.280
a pattern in slasher movies.

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:55.360
A typically-virginal woman tends to be the
only survivor of a killer’s murdering spree,

00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:57.210
fights them, and lives to tell the story.

00:01:57.210 --> 00:01:59.830
And James Cameron’s Aliens picks up her
story later…

00:01:59.830 --> 00:02:01.150
57 years later.

00:02:01.150 --> 00:02:04.810
Ripley is found by a salvage ship and brought
back to a Gateway station near Earth.

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:08.420
She has to defend herself in a room full of
suits for destroying a ship while fighting

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:11.760
an alien she can’t prove existed, which
doesn’t go well.

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:14.320
Ripley: But I'm telling you that those things exist.

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:16.120
Van Luen:  Thank you Officer Ripley, that will be all.

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:17.500
Ripley: Please, you're not listening to me.

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:20.520
So she gets demoted and is forced to work
in a loading dock.

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:24.500
Eventually The Weyland-Yutani Corporation,
a sinister conglomerate also known as The

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:29.940
Company, asks her to be a consultant on a
military expedition that’s being sent back to LV-426.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:34.480
Now there’s a colony there that—surprise—they’ve
lost contact with.

00:02:34.489 --> 00:02:38.819
Suffering from PTSD, Ripley rejects their
request, following the pattern of most characters

00:02:38.819 --> 00:02:39.959
on a hero’s journey.

00:02:39.959 --> 00:02:44.760
But she eventually agrees to go back, feeling
a special duty to protect any survivors and

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:48.900
eradicate the aliens, an enemy no one knows
better than she does.

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:58.920
Ripley: Just tell me one thing, Burke. You're going out there to destroy them, right? Not to study... not to bring back.

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:01.340
...but to wipe them out.

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:07.320
Burke: That's the plan. You have my word on it.

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:08.380
Ripley: All right, I'm in.

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:13.260
These become the two instincts that most define
her as a character: the drive to protect and

00:03:13.279 --> 00:03:14.379
the duty to kill.

00:03:14.379 --> 00:03:17.989
The basic plot is similar to the original
film: the aliens get loose, people run, and

00:03:17.989 --> 00:03:21.159
most of the Marines die in a lopsided fight
early in the film’s second act.

00:03:21.159 --> 00:03:25.219
But after an intense battle with the alien
queen, Ripley survives, along with her found

00:03:25.219 --> 00:03:29.579
family: a surrogate daughter named Newt who’s
the only surviving colonist, a Corporal named

00:03:29.579 --> 00:03:31.629
Hicks, and an android named Bishop.

00:03:31.629 --> 00:03:34.419
The plot of Aliens came from the brain of
James Cameron.

00:03:34.419 --> 00:03:38.139
He was given the opportunity to write a treatment
by 20th Century Fox producers David Giler

00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:40.900
and Walter Hill on the strength of his original
Terminator script.

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:45.319
His treatment hit every note they hoped for
in a sequel, so he was given 18 million dollars

00:03:45.319 --> 00:03:47.980
and sent to Pinewood Studios in England to
make it.

00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:52.469
The British film crew buckled under Cameron’s
exhaustive shooting schedule and inexperience.

00:03:52.469 --> 00:03:57.090
Cameron had guerrilla filmmaking expectations,
where 12 hour days were normal to finish projects

00:03:57.090 --> 00:03:58.390
on time and under budget.

00:03:58.390 --> 00:04:02.370
The 1st A.D. even led a revolt against Cameron
that was eventually put down by Producer Gale

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:04.969
Ann Hurd and effects guru Stan Winston.

00:04:04.969 --> 00:04:10.269
After the movie was finished, it had massive
success, with a worldwide gross of 130 million

00:04:10.269 --> 00:04:13.109
dollars off of an 18 million dollar initial
investment.

00:04:13.109 --> 00:04:17.799
Plus, the awards and accolades piled up, from
Oscar nominations to wins for visual effects

00:04:17.799 --> 00:04:19.180
and sound effect editing.

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:23.620
Aliens is now considered a seminal classic
in sci-fi, horror, and 80s pop culture.

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:27.610
Its structure and themes are incredibly effective
and stand the test of time.

00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:31.530
You can look at the original Alien as a haunted
house film set on a spaceship.

00:04:31.530 --> 00:04:35.900
Ripley was the lone survivor after her companions
were picked off one-by-one by a horrific alien

00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:36.900
monster.

00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:39.683
The same as any Halloween or Friday the 13th
film, really.

00:04:39.683 --> 00:04:41.910
But Aliens takes the basic elements in a different
direction.

00:04:41.910 --> 00:04:45.949
It’s more of an action or war movie, where
a squad of marines is pitted against a squad

00:04:45.949 --> 00:04:46.949
of aliens.

00:04:46.949 --> 00:04:51.180
Roger Ebert wrote of Aliens in his 1986 review,
“...when I walked out of the theater, there

00:04:51.180 --> 00:04:54.590
were knots in my stomach from the film's roller-coaster
ride of violence.”

00:04:54.590 --> 00:04:57.590
He gave it a “Thumbs Up” but also couldn’t
really recommend it.

00:04:57.590 --> 00:04:59.870
So it’s intense, at least for 1986.

00:04:59.870 --> 00:05:03.060
Cameron has said that the marines in this
film were meant to parallel a group of American

00:05:03.060 --> 00:05:06.229
Army soldiers toward the end of their tour
in the Vietnam era.

00:05:06.229 --> 00:05:08.870
He wanted to make it feel like a gritty, realistic
expedition.

00:05:08.870 --> 00:05:12.259
With a fairly tight budget, he used story
elements like the beeping motion-tracker to

00:05:12.259 --> 00:05:13.310
build tension.

00:05:13.310 --> 00:05:17.590
Like the shark in Jaws, sometimes not seeing
the monster is even scarier.

00:05:17.590 --> 00:05:19.260
It’s classic horror storytelling!

00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:23.320
Hudson: Six!
Ripley: That can't be that's inside the room!

00:05:23.320 --> 00:05:24.880
Hudson: It's readin' right, man. Look!

00:05:24.880 --> 00:05:29.220
Not to mention, he didn’t have to spend
money he didn’t have on huge swarms of alien creatures.

00:05:29.300 --> 00:05:32.639
Cameron also says he was trying to show how
cockiness and over-reliance on technology

00:05:32.639 --> 00:05:35.240
can bring about the downfall of large military
institutions.

00:05:35.240 --> 00:05:39.540
And it’s true that his space Marines are
basically a tool of The Company, and don’t

00:05:39.540 --> 00:05:40.540
come off so well.

00:05:40.540 --> 00:05:43.669
He mentions how Americans’ advanced weapons
didn’t matter in the Vietnam war, because

00:05:43.669 --> 00:05:47.360
they didn’t understand how to fight their
low-tech but very stealthy and determined enemy.

00:05:47.360 --> 00:05:51.280
But, whether or not Cameron intended this,
painting both military adversaries and other

00:05:51.290 --> 00:05:54.550
races as savage aliens is not uncommon in
media.

00:05:54.550 --> 00:05:57.310
Especially when you look at texts through
a cultural or racial critical lens.

00:05:57.310 --> 00:06:00.939
There are lots of examples of narrative fiction
where aliens are described as faceless, dangerous

00:06:00.939 --> 00:06:04.030
enemies that are pitted against our usually
white, Western-coded heroes.

00:06:04.030 --> 00:06:08.610
During the Cold War, for instance, alien invasion
was a common plot point in sci-fi and horror

00:06:08.610 --> 00:06:09.720
in the United States.

00:06:09.720 --> 00:06:13.009
Think of films like The Invasion of the Body
Snatchers, which really struck a nerve at

00:06:13.009 --> 00:06:14.009
the time.

00:06:14.009 --> 00:06:18.000
People were afraid of foreign invaders sneaking
into our society, attacking us, and robbing

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:19.889
us of our identities and way of life.

00:06:19.889 --> 00:06:22.389
Other aliens in fiction are much more primitive
than humans.

00:06:22.389 --> 00:06:26.570
Think of A Princess of Mars, which was adapted
into the film John Carter, or even James Cameron’s

00:06:26.570 --> 00:06:27.759
later film, Avatar.

00:06:27.759 --> 00:06:31.950
These aliens can be seen as stereotypical
portrayals of non-white racial others, especially

00:06:31.950 --> 00:06:33.120
native peoples.

00:06:33.120 --> 00:06:36.470
And they usually either end up fighting the
heroes or depending on them to swoop in and

00:06:36.470 --> 00:06:38.190
save their troubled societies.

00:06:38.190 --> 00:06:42.200
So, by one interpretation, Cameron’s choice
to compare his vicious aliens to the Vietnamese

00:06:42.200 --> 00:06:45.910
army makes this another film that parallels
xenophobia in the real world.

00:06:45.910 --> 00:06:49.629
And even though his main intent was to criticize
The Company, and he might not have been trying

00:06:49.629 --> 00:06:53.250
to make a racial commentary, it’s definitely
worth looking at the way Aliens and many other

00:06:53.250 --> 00:06:56.009
sci-fi and horror stories portray alien enemies.

00:06:56.009 --> 00:07:00.280
Now, despite Aliens being a gritty war movie,
the camaraderie and one-liners from the Marines

00:07:00.280 --> 00:07:03.480
are part of what make the film so memorable
and entertaining.

00:07:03.480 --> 00:07:05.380
Hudson: Man, get it on!!! You know it!!!

00:07:05.380 --> 00:07:08.840
And another huge part of that is the setups
and payoffs in the screenplay.

00:07:08.840 --> 00:07:12.470
You can think of Aliens as a series of well-crafted
chain reactions.

00:07:12.470 --> 00:07:16.979
A leads to B which leads to C. There’s always
a reason for what’s happening on screen.

00:07:16.979 --> 00:07:19.919
By today’s standards, these plot points
might be a little obvious.

00:07:19.919 --> 00:07:24.230
But by planting ideas that will come back
around, Cameron lets us anticipate and appreciate

00:07:24.230 --> 00:07:26.190
his cohesive vision for the story.

00:07:26.190 --> 00:07:30.569
For instance, because the compound is basically
a big bomb, the Marines dump all their high-tech

00:07:30.569 --> 00:07:34.759
bullets into Private Frost’s bag and are
told to only use flamethrowers.

00:07:34.759 --> 00:07:39.900
But when the aliens attack, Frost is accidentally
set on fire and the satchel explodes, killing

00:07:39.900 --> 00:07:43.069
another marine and leaving the survivors with
very little ammo.

00:07:43.069 --> 00:07:46.469
Or like when Farrow, the pilot, doesn’t
let her co-pilot explain that something’s

00:07:46.469 --> 00:07:47.469
wrong.

00:07:47.469 --> 00:07:50.530
Then an alien gets on board and kills her,
so the drop ship crashes.

00:07:50.530 --> 00:07:55.229
This strands our heroes, damages the compound—which is a big bomb, as we already know—and forces

00:07:55.229 --> 00:07:58.330
a ticking clock that motivates everyone for
the rest of the film.

00:07:58.330 --> 00:08:02.569
Overall, a lot of Cameron’s setups and payoffs
work to build up Ellen Ripley’s character,

00:08:02.569 --> 00:08:04.110
especially her humanity and heroism.

00:08:04.110 --> 00:08:08.230
She’s at the heart of the film, and at the
heart of her story is love, which is one

00:08:08.230 --> 00:08:11.110
of Cameron’s self-proclaimed favorite themes
to explore.

00:08:11.110 --> 00:08:13.439
And that’s really unusual for an action
movie.

00:08:13.439 --> 00:08:17.530
Like, lots of action-packed stories revolve
around traditionally masculine ideals.

00:08:17.530 --> 00:08:20.870
There are beefy cars and gearheads in films
like The Fast and the Furious, or brooding

00:08:20.870 --> 00:08:22.620
old men in movies like Logan.

00:08:22.620 --> 00:08:25.960
Things like anger, vengeance, or power tend
to be at the center of conflicts.

00:08:25.960 --> 00:08:29.370
Now, in the Alien series, power is still a
major theme.

00:08:29.370 --> 00:08:33.409
But, partially because these movies ultimately
focus on a female hero, it’s interesting

00:08:33.409 --> 00:08:35.649
to unpack them through a feminist critical
lens.

00:08:35.649 --> 00:08:39.820
There have been countless essays written about
 the Alien frankchise from this critical perspective, like

00:08:39.820 --> 00:08:43.770
how the aliens could represent fears of sexual
power, rape, or female reproduction.

00:08:43.770 --> 00:08:47.040
One of the most horrifying parts of these
movies is also what Ripley has nightmares

00:08:47.040 --> 00:08:51.300
about: humans are violated and essentially
become pregnant with aliens, which ultimately

00:08:51.300 --> 00:08:52.300
kill them.

00:08:52.300 --> 00:08:57.050
Like, the facehugger aliens implant babies
into human chests, which incubate and burst

00:08:57.050 --> 00:08:58.200
out in bloody explosions.

00:08:58.200 --> 00:08:59.200
Plus…

00:08:59.200 --> 00:09:00.620
I mean… it’s a penis.

00:09:00.620 --> 00:09:01.620
Just look at it.

00:09:01.620 --> 00:09:05.350
So throughout the first film, Ripley can be
seen as a version of the maiden archetype,

00:09:05.350 --> 00:09:08.029
a damsel-in-distress running from a horrible
monster.

00:09:08.029 --> 00:09:11.320
She fits right into the “final girl” movie
trope, where the last woman standing goes

00:09:11.320 --> 00:09:13.579
from helpless victim to defeating the murderer.

00:09:13.579 --> 00:09:18.850
By the time Aliens happens, Ripley is a traumatized
action hero, who is haunted by alien implantation

00:09:18.850 --> 00:09:21.840
and chest-bursting gore—a very specific
kind of violence.

00:09:21.840 --> 00:09:25.860
A sense of duty compels her to return to LV-426
and fight the aliens.

00:09:25.860 --> 00:09:30.300
But when she discovers Newt on the base, protectiveness
becomes an even bigger motivator.

00:09:30.300 --> 00:09:33.810
You immediately get the sense that Newt becomes
her surrogate daughter, and that the force

00:09:33.810 --> 00:09:35.720
of motherly love is powerful.

00:09:35.720 --> 00:09:39.850
It compels Ripley to survive in the compound
and fight off the aliens, not only for herself

00:09:39.850 --> 00:09:42.029
and for the Marines, but for this young girl.

00:09:42.029 --> 00:09:46.680
So, in a way, Ripley transitions from the
maiden archetype in Alien to the mother archetype

00:09:46.680 --> 00:09:47.880
in Aliens.

00:09:47.880 --> 00:09:52.389
Her character is allowed to be feminine, and
embrace the idea of motherhood and family,

00:09:52.389 --> 00:09:55.660
but she’s not excessively weak or emotional,
or made to be the butt of a joke.

00:09:55.660 --> 00:10:00.740
This perfectly sets up Ripley and the alien
queen in direct conflict: two mothers are

00:10:00.740 --> 00:10:04.370
both protective of their children, and they’re
locked in combat because their goals are in

00:10:04.370 --> 00:10:05.370
opposition.

00:10:05.370 --> 00:10:08.110
That’s very basic, but also very effective
screenwriting.

00:10:08.110 --> 00:10:11.730
And it leads us to one of the ultimate payoffs
of the film: Ripley getting into the power

00:10:11.730 --> 00:10:13.440
loader suit to fight off the queen.

00:10:13.440 --> 00:10:16.960
This is Cameron planting the seeds for the
climax of the movie, when Ripley’s skill

00:10:17.040 --> 00:10:21.540
is the key to protecting her newfound family—Newt,
and an injured Corporal Hicks.

00:10:21.540 --> 00:10:22.880
As Ripley yells...

00:10:22.880 --> 00:10:26.900
Ripley: Get away from her you *JERK*!!!

00:10:26.960 --> 00:10:29.600
we’re all cheering for her and the strength of motherly love.

00:10:29.610 --> 00:10:31.529
And audiences weren’t the only ones cheering.

00:10:31.529 --> 00:10:36.060
Sigourney Weaver was nominated for the 1987
Oscar for Best Actress for this role—an

00:10:36.060 --> 00:10:38.840
honor that hadn’t been given to an action
movie heroine before.

00:10:38.840 --> 00:10:42.320
And it was for a protagonist motivated by
love for her found family.

00:10:42.320 --> 00:10:45.910
So you’ve got to give Aliens some credit,
whether you appreciate it as a well-constructed

00:10:45.910 --> 00:10:50.110
sci-fi classic or for Ellen Ripley’s impact
on female heroes in decades to come.

00:10:50.110 --> 00:10:54.839
But it’s also a great example of using film
criticism to look at genre-transcending stories

00:10:54.839 --> 00:10:58.690
in multiple ways, which directors may or may
not have intended.

00:10:58.690 --> 00:11:02.829
Next time, we’ll talk about the critically-acclaimed
Selma, a historical drama film about the life

00:11:02.829 --> 00:11:07.190
of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., and the role
that media can play in shaping our idea of

00:11:07.190 --> 00:11:09.100
what actually happened in 
the past.

00:11:09.100 --> 00:11:16.580
Crash Course Film Criticism is produced in association with PBS Digital Studios. You can head over to their channel and check out a playlist of their latest shows,

00:11:16.580 --> 00:11:19.440
like Eons, PBS Infinite Series, and PBS Space Time.

00:11:19.440 --> 00:11:23.060
This episode of Crash Course was filmed in
the Doctor Cheryl C. Kinney Crash Course Studio

00:11:23.079 --> 00:11:26.309
