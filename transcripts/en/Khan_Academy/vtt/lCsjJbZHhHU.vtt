00:00:00.689 --> 00:00:02.230
When you get into
higher mathematics,

00:00:02.230 --> 00:00:03.870
you might see a
professor write something

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:05.411
like this on a board,
where it's just

00:00:05.411 --> 00:00:08.730
this R with this extra
backbone right over here.

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:10.790
And maybe they write R2.

00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:12.540
Or if you're looking
at it in a book,

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:14.260
it might just be
a bolded capital

00:00:14.260 --> 00:00:17.790
R with a 2
superscript like this.

00:00:17.790 --> 00:00:19.490
And if you see this,
they're referring

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:22.570
to the two-dimensional
real coordinate

00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:27.190
space, which sounds very fancy.

00:00:30.362 --> 00:00:31.820
But one way to
think about it, it's

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:33.950
really just the
two-dimensional space

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:37.400
that you're used to dealing
with in your coordinate plane.

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:39.020
To go a little
bit more abstract,

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:42.870
this isn't necessarily
this visual representation.

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:45.470
This visual
representation is one way

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:47.830
to think about this
real coordinate space.

00:00:47.830 --> 00:00:50.340
If we were to think about it
a little bit more abstractly,

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:54.800
the real R2, the two-dimensional
real coordinate space--

00:00:54.800 --> 00:01:00.750
let me write this down-- and the
two-dimensional real coordinate

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:01.250
space.

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:03.090
And just to break
down the notation,

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:05.420
the 2 tells us how many
dimensions we're dealing with,

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:09.020
and then the R tells us this
is a real coordinate space.

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:11.010
The two-dimensional
real coordinate space

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:15.870
is all the possible
real-valued 2-tuples.

00:01:15.870 --> 00:01:17.950
Let me write that down.

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:30.830
This is all possible
real-valued 2-tuples.

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:33.030
So what is a 2-tuple?

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:37.160
Well, a tuple is an
ordered list of numbers.

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:38.910
And since we're talking
about real values,

00:01:38.910 --> 00:01:41.180
it's going to be ordered
list of real numbers,

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:44.960
and a 2-tuple just says it's
an ordered list of 2 numbers.

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:47.750
So this is an ordered list
of 2 real-valued numbers.

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:49.540
Well, that's exactly
what we did here

00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:51.990
when we thought about a
two-dimensional vector.

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:53.690
This right over
here is a 2-tuple,

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:55.780
and this is a
real-valued 2-tuple.

00:01:55.780 --> 00:01:58.590
Neither of these have
any imaginary parts.

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:00.290
So you have a 3 and a 4.

00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:01.200
Order matters.

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:08.990
We view this as a different
2-tuple than, say, 4, 3.

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:12.740
And even if we were trying
to represent them in our axes

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:15.260
right over here,
this vector, 4, 3,

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:18.130
would be 4 along
the horizontal axis,

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:22.220
and then 3 along
the vertical axis.

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:24.339
And so it would look
something like this.

00:02:24.339 --> 00:02:26.630
And remember, we don't have
to draw it just over there.

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:28.840
We just care about its
magnitude and direction.

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:32.230
We could draw it
right over here.

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:38.489
This would also be 4, 3,
the column vector, 4 3.

00:02:38.489 --> 00:02:40.030
So when we're talking
about R2, we're

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:43.610
talking about all of the
possible real-valued 2-tuples.

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:47.660
So all the possible
vectors that you can have,

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:50.380
where each of its components--
and the components

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:52.190
are these numbers
right over here--

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:56.000
where each of its components
are a real number.

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:57.780
So you might have 3, 4.

00:02:57.780 --> 00:02:59.580
You could have
negative 3, negative 4.

00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:04.640
So that would be 1,
2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 4,

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:06.567
might look something
like-- actually,

00:03:06.567 --> 00:03:08.400
I should make the scale
a little bit bigger,

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:12.040
so it looks the
same-- 1, 2, 3, 4.

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:16.060
So it might look
something like that.

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:18.660
So that would be the
vector, negative 3--

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:22.630
let me write a little bit
better than that-- negative 3,

00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:24.210
and negative 4.

00:03:24.210 --> 00:03:27.040
So if you were to take all
of the possible 2-tuples,

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:30.960
including the vector 0,
0-- so it has no magnitude,

00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:34.240
and you could debate what its
direction is right over there--

00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:36.550
you take all of those
combined, and then

00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:39.690
you have created your
two-dimensional real coordinate

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:40.300
space.

00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:43.440
And that is referred to as R2.

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:44.830
Now, as you can
imagine, the fact

00:03:44.830 --> 00:03:46.246
that we wrote this
2 here-- we had

00:03:46.246 --> 00:03:48.680
to specify-- it's like, hey,
well, could I put a 3 there?

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:51.470
And I would say, absolutely,
you could put a 3 there.

00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:54.920
So R3 would be the
three-dimensional real

00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:56.170
coordinate space.

00:03:56.170 --> 00:04:02.750
So 3D real coordinate space.

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:04.840
And so you would
view this as all

00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:06.780
the possible
real-valued 3-tuples.

00:04:13.170 --> 00:04:20.436
So, for example, that
would be a member of R3.

00:04:20.436 --> 00:04:22.060
And let me actually
label these vectors

00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:23.476
just so we get in
the habit of it.

00:04:23.476 --> 00:04:26.570
So let's say we
call this vector x.

00:04:26.570 --> 00:04:31.210
Let's say we have a vector
b, that looks like this.

00:04:31.210 --> 00:04:34.970
Negative 1, 5, 3.

00:04:34.970 --> 00:04:38.200
Both of these would
be members of R3.

00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:41.090
And if you want to see some
fancy notation, a member

00:04:41.090 --> 00:04:47.510
of a set-- so this
is a member of R3--

00:04:47.510 --> 00:04:51.030
it is a real-valued 3-tuple.

00:04:51.030 --> 00:04:53.600
Now you say, well, what
would not be a member of R3?

00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:55.450
Well, this right over
here isn't a 3-tuple.

00:04:55.450 --> 00:04:57.260
This right over here
is a member of R2.

00:04:57.260 --> 00:04:59.260
Now, you might be able
to extend it in some way,

00:04:59.260 --> 00:05:01.470
add a zero or
something, but formally,

00:05:01.470 --> 00:05:03.500
this is not a 3-tuple.

00:05:03.500 --> 00:05:06.910
Another thing that would not
be a member of R3-- let's say

00:05:06.910 --> 00:05:11.130
someone wanted to make
some type of vector that

00:05:11.130 --> 00:05:12.810
had some imaginary parts in it.

00:05:12.810 --> 00:05:15.980
So let's say it had i, 0, 1.

00:05:15.980 --> 00:05:18.350
This is no longer real-valued.

00:05:18.350 --> 00:05:22.260
We have put an imaginary--
this number up here

00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:23.840
has an imaginary part.

00:05:23.840 --> 00:05:28.690
So this is no longer
a real-valued 3-tuple.

00:05:28.690 --> 00:05:30.380
And what's neat about
linear algebra is,

00:05:30.380 --> 00:05:31.546
we don't have to stop there.

00:05:31.546 --> 00:05:35.800
R3 we can visualize, we
can plot these things.

00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:37.342
In your previous
mathematical career,

00:05:37.342 --> 00:05:39.841
especially if you have some
type of a hologram or something,

00:05:39.841 --> 00:05:42.500
it's not hard to visualize
things in three dimensions.

00:05:42.500 --> 00:05:44.860
But what's neat is that we
can keep extending this.

00:05:44.860 --> 00:05:48.430
We can go into 4, 5, 6,
7, 20, 100 dimensions.

00:05:48.430 --> 00:05:51.120
And obviously there it becomes
much harder, if not impossible,

00:05:51.120 --> 00:05:52.360
to visualize it.

00:05:52.360 --> 00:05:55.450
But then we can at least
represent it mathematically

00:05:55.450 --> 00:05:57.879
with an n-tuple of vectors.

00:05:57.879 --> 00:06:00.170
And so if we were to talk
about a real coordinate space

00:06:00.170 --> 00:06:04.840
generally, you'll often
see the notation Rn,

00:06:04.840 --> 00:06:06.380
with n as a superscript.

00:06:06.380 --> 00:06:12.670
So this right over here is an
n-dimensional real coordinate

00:06:12.670 --> 00:06:14.220
space.
