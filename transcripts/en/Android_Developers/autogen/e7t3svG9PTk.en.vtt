 [Funny Music] 

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:07.533
 Herond: When I start my company 

00:00:07.533 --> 00:00:08.700
 With two of my friends 

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:10.366
 I decided to try Edjing 

00:00:10.366 --> 00:00:12.433
 It was the first free DJ application last week. 

00:00:12.433 --> 00:00:14.433
 The idea came from my passion for music. 

00:00:14.433 --> 00:00:17.833
 I used to play DJ during student concerts 

00:00:17.833 --> 00:00:21.566
 At the moment I do not see great ease in using 

00:00:21.566 --> 00:00:23.466
 Another solution to create a mix of songs. 

00:00:23.466 --> 00:00:26.600
 Today we have more than 60 million USD. 

00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:29.400
 The edjing application is the most likely to bring in dollar profits. 

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:32.300
 There are branches of our company in 182 countries 

00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:35.033
 So I'm very proud of my team. 

00:00:35.033 --> 00:00:37.600
 When we launched our apps on Android 

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:40.966
 This system has become the biggest contributor to our company's prosperity. 

00:00:40.966 --> 00:00:44.833
 We earn 50% of our revenue on the Android platform 

00:00:44.833 --> 00:00:49.833
 We also earn over 70% of our earnings in dollars via Android. 

00:00:51.066 --> 00:00:53.000
 Piet: Our mission is 

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.333
 Provide great musical instruments for music lovers. 

00:00:56.333 --> 00:01:01.066
 We think that's why we're successful on Android 

00:01:01.066 --> 00:01:03.900
 Is the fact of our dedication in 

00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:07.666
 Design great and high quality applications for users. 

00:01:07.666 --> 00:01:09.966
 The other reason is tools 

00:01:09.966 --> 00:01:13.600
 Provided by Google Play Publishers. 

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:18.333
 The multidimensional design was a big breakthrough for the design team. 

00:01:18.333 --> 00:01:23.400
 It is more integrated and easier to use. 

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:28.133
 This has really encouraged designers to discover Android features and enthusiasm. 

00:01:28.133 --> 00:01:30.866
 We really care about the voice response time factor. 

00:01:30.866 --> 00:01:33.666
 We design music apps 

00:01:33.666 --> 00:01:36.300
 These applications must be very responsive 

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:38.533
 The efficiency is also very great. 

00:01:38.533 --> 00:01:42.866
 For DJ applications, the response time should be as low as possible. 

00:01:42.866 --> 00:01:45.400
 Dilipin: Represents voice time response time 

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:47.700
 Between song play time 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:50.200
 And actually broadcast the music from the loudspeaker. 

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:53.066
 And the new Android Marshmallow devices 

00:01:53.066 --> 00:01:56.166
 Such as Nexus 9, Nexus 5X, and Nexus 6P 

00:01:56.166 --> 00:01:58.933
 The response time is less than 20 milliseconds. 

00:01:58.933 --> 00:02:03.033
 Thus, we can provide an application 

00:02:03.033 --> 00:02:04.766
 More stable and faster response 

00:02:04.766 --> 00:02:08.066
 Which improves the experience for DJs. 

00:02:08.066 --> 00:02:11.066
 BAYET: We created the Mixfader this year. 

00:02:11.066 --> 00:02:12.400
 It lets you mix songs and play them 

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:14.600
 Directly from your smartphone or tablet 

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:16.433
 Via Bluetooth. 

00:02:16.433 --> 00:02:18.400
 Dilipin: Our Marshmallow software developers 

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:21.133
 Are able to handle large communication processes 

00:02:21.133 --> 00:02:25.033
 Between an Android device and a Mixfader. 

00:02:25.033 --> 00:02:28.833
 In other platforms the minimum is 20 milliseconds 

00:02:28.833 --> 00:02:31.033
 For Bluetooth connections. 

00:02:31.033 --> 00:02:35.233
 We were able to reach a response time of 7.5 milliseconds. 

00:02:35.233 --> 00:02:39.300
 So the Android platform provides us with the best experience to use. 

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:42.633
 BAYET: At first we provided free trial applications 

00:02:42.633 --> 00:02:45.233
 But we started experimenting with ads. 

00:02:45.233 --> 00:02:47.966
 Our revenue has doubled through AdMob 

00:02:47.966 --> 00:02:50.566
 At a rate of two or three times as applicable. 

00:02:50.566 --> 00:02:54.566
 We prefer Google Play because it makes it easier to interact with users. 

00:02:54.566 --> 00:02:57.233
 When they add reviews about our apps to the store 

00:02:57.233 --> 00:02:58.633
 We can respond directly to them. 

00:02:58.633 --> 00:03:02.433
 As well as uploading an update very quickly. 

00:03:02.433 --> 00:03:05.766
 This is very useful to us in fact. 

00:03:05.766 --> 00:03:07.100
 Herond: Today, DJiT occupies the company 

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:09.100
 Ranked 10th among the largest successful music application companies. 

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:11.966
 We aspire to be ranked first 

00:03:11.966 --> 00:03:13.566
 Over the next two years. 

00:03:13.566 --> 00:03:16.433
 Thanks to improved voice response time on Android 

00:03:16.433 --> 00:03:18.900
 We can create new music apps for users 

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:21.100
 We are very excited about that. 

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:26.100
