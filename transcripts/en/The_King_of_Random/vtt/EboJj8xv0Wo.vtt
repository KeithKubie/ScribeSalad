00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:03.120
[Captions by Y Translator]
Let's take a look at how to
build your very own floating faucet.

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:06.300
A cool optical illusion that makes
it look like a faucet head is

00:00:06.300 --> 00:00:08.180
floating on a stream of water.

00:00:08.180 --> 00:00:17.160
[Music]

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:20.040
We got a common request
from Menachem Roubini,

00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:22.480
and I'm almost certainly
pronouncing that incorrectly,

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:26.650
but it was asking if we could
please make a magic/floating faucet.

00:00:26.650 --> 00:00:29.480
Yes, we can, and we're
going to show you how to do it.

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:30.460
Here's what I was thinking.

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:34.640
A clear plastic tube will lead
from a small pump up to our faucet above.

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:37.480
The water flowing down out of
the faucet should cover the tube,

00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:40.540
giving the illusion that the water
itself is holding the faucet up.

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:43.140
To get started, we're going to need
a small submersible water pump,

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:44.559
a spigot or faucet.

00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:46.840
I prefer the kind of looks
like it's a garden hose attachment.

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:50.020
Some 1/2 inch outer diameter clear tube.

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:52.320
This is rigid tube, not flexible vinyl.

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:53.160
This one's acrylic.

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:56.480
You might be able to find it
in polycarbonate as well, and a bucket,

00:00:56.480 --> 00:00:58.620
or any other waterproof
container that's about the right

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:01.780
size and shape, and matches the look
that you want for your fountain.

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:06.280
And my bucket is also full of
these clear glass beads,

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:08.780
and I'm using these
because I like the look of it.

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:10.040
There's other things you can use.

00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:12.160
If you want to use just
natural rocks, you can do that.

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:13.940
It looks good in all sorts
of different colors.

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:17.040
I do have a reason I'm using the
clear glass, and I'll get to that later.

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:19.200
But there's lots of options
like I was saying.

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:21.960
Our pump is going to end up
going down inside of this bucket,

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:24.050
but we don't want our cord
coming up over the edge.

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:25.992
So, like we did with
our small Vortex Fountain,

00:01:25.992 --> 00:01:28.800
we're going to drill
a small hole into the bucket.

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:32.220
We're going to cut our chord,
and then solder it back together

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:34.160
once we've run it through the bucket.

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:37.780
For this chord, we're going to
solder one of the sides together,

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:41.060
but the other side, were going to
leave unattached because we want to add

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:43.490
an inline switch that lets us
turn the pump on and off

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:44.620
without unplugging it.

00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:56.700
[Music]

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:00.000
Now, let's trim off the extra
cord so it gets divided.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.200
This little piece of plastic is
designed to keep the two pieces separate.

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:08.380
This other side that we poke on top
of that has prongs on both sides,

00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:11.120
and these are designed to stab
through the rubber of the cord,

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:13.460
and make a connection
between the two sides.

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:21.540
[Music]

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:23.600
Now, we've got our pump
inside of our bucket,

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:25.220
the cord comes out to the outside,

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:28.100
and eventually, we are going
to stop that hole up entirely.

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:29.400
We're going to use some hot glue for that.

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:31.700
But it's not time to do that quite
yet, because we don't want to

00:02:31.709 --> 00:02:33.249
limit the movement on the pump.

00:02:33.249 --> 00:02:37.220
So, let's grab our 1/2 inch
outer diameter acrylic tube,

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:39.560
and let's figure out the length that we need.

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:42.820
The faucets going to be
somewhere up here.

00:02:42.820 --> 00:02:43.819
We can fit this down.

00:02:43.819 --> 00:02:45.360
Now, the pump I'm using,

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:47.720
it actually fits perfectly over the nozzle

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:48.859
that comes with the pump.

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:50.560
It kind of snaps into place even.

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:52.280
It's a watertight seal.

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:53.480
It's just what we're looking for.

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:57.420
So we have to figure out how
high we want our spigot to go.

00:02:57.430 --> 00:02:59.940
I mean, if we put it up too high,
then the pumps not going to have

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:02.860
enough power to really get
the water all the way up there.

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:05.480
If we put it too low, it's not
really going to look very cool.

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:08.480
So we're just going for a
few inches above the bucket.

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:11.000
[Music]

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:14.060
Now, we're going to use a
hacksaw to carefully cut that off.

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:18.569
Our tube cut, but acrylic is pretty
fragile stuff, and right at the end,

00:03:18.569 --> 00:03:20.340
it did crack just a little bit.

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:22.950
We're going to use a belt
sander just smooth that off.

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:25.840
Give us a nice clean edge that
doesn't have any ridges in it like that.

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:40.220
[Music]

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:43.359
There's the edge of the tube, and we're
going to want to glue that right

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:45.400
down into the middle of the spigot.

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:48.819
But once we've glued it down, it's going
to be sealing off a lot of the opening,

00:03:48.819 --> 00:03:51.540
and we want water to be
able to come out of the top,

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:55.040
and sort of pour back down, like
it was coming out of the spigot itself.

00:03:55.520 --> 00:04:00.000
So what we need to do now is drill
some small holes in the top of the tube.

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:02.719
We've got quite a small drill bit here,
and we're now going to drill

00:04:02.719 --> 00:04:06.169
eight holes into the top of this tube,
and we're going to try and make

00:04:06.169 --> 00:04:07.380
it really close to the top.

00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:09.860
Maybe only an eighth of an inch away.

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:12.520
Of course, since we do want all the holes

00:04:12.520 --> 00:04:14.860
spaced evenly directly
across from each other,

00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:17.960
we're going to drill right down
through one side, and then out the other.

00:04:17.960 --> 00:04:33.120
[Music]

00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:36.420
Running a little bit of sandpaper
over the top helps remove any burrs,

00:04:36.420 --> 00:04:40.880
and it roughs up the plastic just
a little bit to help the glue bond to it.

00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:43.300
Now, we need to attach
this onto our faucet,

00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:46.600
and to do that, we're going
to be using some two-part epoxy.

00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:51.300
This is J-B Weld, the Kwik version
of it that takes five to six minutes

00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:53.320
to cure, instead of four or five hours.

00:04:54.580 --> 00:04:56.640
You don't have to use this kind of glue.

00:04:56.640 --> 00:04:59.320
Other strong types of glue
should work as well.

00:04:59.320 --> 00:05:03.160
But I like this stuff because it is
designed to bond really well to metal.

00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:11.800
[Music]

00:05:11.860 --> 00:05:16.260
We want glue to get about as high as it
can get without reaching the holes.

00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:18.220
That will help it grip a lot better.

00:05:18.220 --> 00:05:24.460
[Music]

00:05:24.470 --> 00:05:25.269
The epoxy's cured,

00:05:25.269 --> 00:05:28.200
which means the faucet is now
holding itself onto the acrylic tube

00:05:28.200 --> 00:05:29.710
without any assistance.

00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:31.300
It doesn't fall off.

00:05:31.760 --> 00:05:32.720
Not really wiggling.

00:05:32.720 --> 00:05:33.420
Just what we want.

00:05:33.420 --> 00:05:36.220
So now, we need to attach
this onto our pump,

00:05:36.220 --> 00:05:37.840
and as I was saying before,

00:05:37.860 --> 00:05:41.420
this size of acrylic tube, this is
1/2 inch outer diameter tube,

00:05:41.420 --> 00:05:43.800
actually fits just perfectly
onto the nozzle that came

00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:46.540
with this particular pump,
which is pretty convenient.

00:05:46.780 --> 00:05:51.220
Now, I'm holding the pump, but I'm not
touching the tube or the faucet itself.

00:05:51.220 --> 00:05:53.940
And as you can see, it
stays up right where we wanted.

00:05:54.360 --> 00:05:57.896
One other thing that we want to do
before we add all of our stones back in

00:05:57.900 --> 00:06:02.620
is I have this battery
powered waterproof LED light.

00:06:02.620 --> 00:06:05.420
This thing's pretty nifty,
it's controlled by remote control,

00:06:05.420 --> 00:06:07.340
and you can just change the colors.

00:06:07.340 --> 00:06:09.480
It's not going to be hurt
by being underwater,

00:06:09.480 --> 00:06:13.580
and it is battery powered so you don't
need any sort of cord running to it.

00:06:13.580 --> 00:06:16.700
We're actually going to take this light
and put it underneath our pump,

00:06:16.700 --> 00:06:19.120
so it's just resting
on the bottom of our bucket,

00:06:19.120 --> 00:06:21.120
and the pump is going to sit on top of it.

00:06:21.120 --> 00:06:24.100
Now that we have that there,
we can see how much of our cord

00:06:24.100 --> 00:06:25.920
we need for to be able to reach.

00:06:25.920 --> 00:06:27.720
So at this point,
we can take some hot glue,

00:06:27.720 --> 00:06:29.840
and seal off the hole,
where the cord is running out.

00:06:29.840 --> 00:06:38.080
[Music]

00:06:38.080 --> 00:06:39.480
With the hot glue seal in place,

00:06:39.480 --> 00:06:41.560
we can now put the light down
at the bottom of the bucket,

00:06:41.560 --> 00:06:43.020
the pump on top of the light,

00:06:43.020 --> 00:06:46.300
attach our pipe and faucet
on top of the pump,

00:06:46.300 --> 00:06:47.940
and then start piling the stones in

00:06:47.940 --> 00:06:50.000
because that's what's
going to hold everything in place.

00:06:51.860 --> 00:06:53.220
Now, let's add some water.

00:06:53.220 --> 00:06:55.180
How much water
you add is kind of up to you.

00:06:55.180 --> 00:06:58.660
I like to bring it up to just
below the surface of the stones.

00:07:00.540 --> 00:07:04.780
Random fact: A leaky faucet that drips
at the rate of one drip per second

00:07:04.780 --> 00:07:07.540
can waste more than
3000 gallons a year,

00:07:07.540 --> 00:07:09.860
which is equal to like 180 showers.

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:14.100
Okay, we've got our bucket plugged in.

00:07:15.780 --> 00:07:17.380
Let's turn it on and see how this goes.

00:07:17.900 --> 00:07:22.280
Now, ideally, the water will come up
out the holes in the top of the pipes,

00:07:22.280 --> 00:07:24.680
and distribute themselves
around the sides.

00:07:24.680 --> 00:07:28.000
Sometimes I've found that the water
kind of doesn't stick very well

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:30.030
to the pipe, and you kind of
need to just touch it to get

00:07:30.030 --> 00:07:31.620
it start flowing everywhere.

00:07:31.980 --> 00:07:33.220
Let's see what we can get.

00:07:33.760 --> 00:07:34.740
Ooh!

00:07:35.660 --> 00:07:37.580
Didn't need much encouragement at all.

00:07:37.960 --> 00:07:40.700
Perfect. That means we did a pretty
good job of lining everything up,

00:07:40.700 --> 00:07:43.890
so the water is being distributed
evenly all around, and look at this!

00:07:43.890 --> 00:07:47.080
We've now got water
flowing out of the faucet,

00:07:47.220 --> 00:07:49.640
and that's what's holding
the faucet up in the first place.

00:07:49.640 --> 00:07:50.320
That's...

00:07:51.600 --> 00:07:54.100
It's a really cool like, just illusion,

00:07:54.100 --> 00:07:57.200
and makes it look like, Oh,
the waters holding the spigot up.

00:07:57.780 --> 00:07:59.160
Very fun to look at.

00:07:59.160 --> 00:08:02.780
[Music]

00:08:02.780 --> 00:08:06.540
One of the main reasons I like using
these glass stones is that the signal

00:08:06.550 --> 00:08:09.020
from my remote control has
an easier time getting down

00:08:09.020 --> 00:08:10.560
into the bucket, so I can turn it on.

00:08:10.560 --> 00:08:13.320
Now, it's really hard to
see in this bright daylight.

00:08:13.580 --> 00:08:15.580
Let's take it somewhere
a little bit more visible.

00:08:15.580 --> 00:08:31.120
[Music]

00:08:31.120 --> 00:08:34.980
One more small modification
we can make is to take some very fine

00:08:34.980 --> 00:08:39.700
grit sandpaper, and lightly, gently
sand of the tube from top to bottom.

00:08:39.700 --> 00:08:42.720
This should leave some very
light white marks on the outside,

00:08:42.720 --> 00:08:45.920
which can help enhance
the illusion of flowing water.

00:08:45.920 --> 00:08:50.460
[Music]

00:08:50.460 --> 00:08:52.360
It's not a major difference,
but you may decide

00:08:52.360 --> 00:08:54.040
you like that look a little bit better.

00:08:54.940 --> 00:08:56.420
Once again, I'm sure
I'm saying this wrong,

00:08:56.420 --> 00:08:59.360
but Menachem Roubini,
thank you for your suggestion.

00:08:59.360 --> 00:09:01.180
This is a fun build,
a fun project,

00:09:01.180 --> 00:09:02.890
and it's definitely something
that you can do at home.

00:09:02.890 --> 00:09:05.240
It doesn't take too long,
and it doesn't cost that much.

00:09:05.240 --> 00:09:06.500
Check the links in the description

00:09:06.500 --> 00:09:08.660
for where to buy
some of these pieces online.

00:09:08.660 --> 00:09:10.400
Mr. Roubini, check your YouTube inbox.

00:09:10.400 --> 00:09:11.800
We're going to be sending you 25 bucks.

00:09:11.800 --> 00:09:15.120
Guys, remember, if you've got any cool
ideas of things you want to see us do,

00:09:15.120 --> 00:09:16.280
let us know down in the comments,

00:09:16.280 --> 00:09:18.960
and if we use your idea to
make a video, we'll send you $25.

00:09:22.860 --> 00:09:23.760
Hmm...

00:09:23.760 --> 00:09:24.720
