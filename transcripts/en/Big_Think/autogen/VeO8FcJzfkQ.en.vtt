have the delivery the next day think of
 

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:00.500
have the delivery the next day think of
the vulnerabilities right that exist in

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:00.510
the vulnerabilities right that exist in
 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:02.299
the vulnerabilities right that exist in
just that one moment right you got to

00:01:02.299 --> 00:01:02.309
just that one moment right you got to
 

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:04.310

move something from here to there to get
 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:06.560
move something from here to there to get
to my house and we have to think of

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:06.570
to my house and we have to think of
 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:08.660
to my house and we have to think of
ourselves and our own vulnerabilities as

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:08.670
ourselves and our own vulnerabilities as
 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:12.230
ourselves and our own vulnerabilities as
not only desirable but also choices

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:12.240
not only desirable but also choices
 

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:14.929
not only desirable but also choices
we've made and so that's how I now think

00:01:14.929 --> 00:01:14.939
we've made and so that's how I now think
 

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:17.570
we've made and so that's how I now think
about risk right that we are going to

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:17.580
about risk right that we are going to
 

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:21.410
about risk right that we are going to
accept a level of risk from whatever

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:21.420
accept a level of risk from whatever
 

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:24.350
accept a level of risk from whatever
harms come our way and we can try to

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:24.360
harms come our way and we can try to
 

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:26.899
harms come our way and we can try to
prevent them and prepare for if they

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:26.909
prevent them and prepare for if they
 

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:29.030
prevent them and prepare for if they
happen but we also should get better

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:29.040
happen but we also should get better
 

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:31.760
happen but we also should get better
about responding and thinking about how

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:31.770
about responding and thinking about how
 

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:33.649
about responding and thinking about how
we would protect our own families and

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:33.659
we would protect our own families and
 

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:36.469
we would protect our own families and
communities if something were to happen

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:36.479
communities if something were to happen
 

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:39.830
communities if something were to happen
but this idea that you know the idea

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:39.840
but this idea that you know the idea
 

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:42.469
but this idea that you know the idea
after nine eleven that never again was

00:01:42.469 --> 00:01:42.479
after nine eleven that never again was
 

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:43.910
after nine eleven that never again was
going to be our standard right never

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:43.920
going to be our standard right never
 

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:45.260
going to be our standard right never
again I understand that we were

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:45.270
again I understand that we were
 

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:48.310
again I understand that we were
traumatized and it was delusional and

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:48.320
traumatized and it was delusional and
 

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:51.109
traumatized and it was delusional and
we've been successful at stopping that

00:01:51.109 --> 00:01:51.119
we've been successful at stopping that
 

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:53.149
we've been successful at stopping that
kind of attack but you know the idea

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:53.159
kind of attack but you know the idea
 

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:56.510
kind of attack but you know the idea
that we're going to stop every in a sort

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:56.520
that we're going to stop every in a sort
 

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:59.120

00:02:08.389 --> 00:02:08.399
soft target the idea that any security
 

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:10.400
soft target the idea that any security

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:10.410
apparatus is going to stop that guy it's
 

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:12.050
apparatus is going to stop that guy it's
just it's delusional and I

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:12.060
just it's delusional and I
 

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:14.270
just it's delusional and I
think we have to sort of accept that

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:14.280
think we have to sort of accept that
 

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:16.309
think we have to sort of accept that
while there are risks out there they are

00:02:16.309 --> 00:02:16.319
while there are risks out there they are
 

00:02:16.319 --> 00:02:21.020
while there are risks out there they are
they far outweighed by the lack of

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:21.030
they far outweighed by the lack of
 

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:23.570
they far outweighed by the lack of
violence in our society but that those

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:23.580
violence in our society but that those
 

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:25.100
violence in our society but that those
risks are just ones that we have to

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:25.110
risks are just ones that we have to
 

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:28.460
risks are just ones that we have to
accept I also think that from those who

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:28.470
accept I also think that from those who
 

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:30.830
accept I also think that from those who

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:38.120
created a sort of counter narrative
right that the reaction to it was to

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:38.130
right that the reaction to it was to
 

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:39.740
right that the reaction to it was to
think it was all a bunch of BS right

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:39.750
think it was all a bunch of BS right
 

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:41.330

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:14.760
so focused on sort of never again right
 

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:16.490

city and and let it drown and I think
 

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:24.830

that we have to sort of find that space

00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:24.840
that we have to sort of find that space
 

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:27.729
that we have to sort of find that space
in between those two extremes and

00:03:27.729 --> 00:03:27.739
in between those two extremes and
 

00:03:27.739 --> 00:03:31.490
in between those two extremes and
recognize that there are risks but that

00:03:31.490 --> 00:03:31.500
recognize that there are risks but that
 

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:34.580
recognize that there are risks but that
we actually can do a lot to minimize

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:34.590
we actually can do a lot to minimize
 

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:36.440
we actually can do a lot to minimize
those risks to ourselves and so like one

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:36.450
those risks to ourselves and so like one
 

00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:38.330
those risks to ourselves and so like one
perfect example is look I'm a

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:38.340
perfect example is look I'm a

our in our security and safety discourse

00:04:16.420 --> 00:04:16.430
our in our security and safety discourse
 

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:20.750
our in our security and safety discourse
maybe we can start to make some progress
