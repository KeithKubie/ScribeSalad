00:00:00.291 --> 00:00:01.571
- What we're going to do in this video

00:00:01.571 --> 00:00:05.341
is talk about a special
class of random variables

00:00:05.341 --> 00:00:07.674
known as binomial variables.

00:00:09.533 --> 00:00:12.882
And as we will see as we build
up our understanding of them,

00:00:12.882 --> 00:00:15.085
not only are they interesting
in their own right,

00:00:15.085 --> 00:00:16.675
but there's a lot of very powerful

00:00:16.675 --> 00:00:18.359
probability and statistics

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:21.035
that we can do based on our understanding

00:00:21.035 --> 00:00:23.288
of binomial variables.

00:00:23.288 --> 00:00:26.123
So to make things concrete
as quickly as possible,

00:00:26.123 --> 00:00:28.592
I'll start with a very tangible example

00:00:28.592 --> 00:00:29.734
of a binomial variable

00:00:29.734 --> 00:00:31.434
and then we'll think a
little bit more abstractly

00:00:31.434 --> 00:00:34.097
abut what makes it binomial.

00:00:34.097 --> 00:00:36.089
So let's say that I have a coin.

00:00:36.089 --> 00:00:38.106
This is my coin here.

00:00:38.106 --> 00:00:40.922
It doesn't even have to be a fair coin.

00:00:40.922 --> 00:00:42.410
Let me just draw this really fast.

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:43.478
So that's my coin.

00:00:43.478 --> 00:00:46.224
And let's say on a
given flip of that coin,

00:00:46.224 --> 00:00:50.504
the probability that I get
heads is zero point six

00:00:50.504 --> 00:00:52.604
and the probability that I'd get tails,

00:00:52.604 --> 00:00:54.496
well it'd be one minus zero point six

00:00:54.496 --> 00:00:56.079
or zero point four.

00:00:58.453 --> 00:01:00.911
And what I'm going to do
is I'm going to define

00:01:00.911 --> 00:01:03.277
a random variable X

00:01:03.277 --> 00:01:06.058
as being equal to the number

00:01:06.058 --> 00:01:06.891
of heads

00:01:09.314 --> 00:01:10.147
after

00:01:11.958 --> 00:01:12.791
after

00:01:13.881 --> 00:01:15.038
ten

00:01:15.038 --> 00:01:15.871
flips

00:01:17.161 --> 00:01:18.078
of my coin.

00:01:20.319 --> 00:01:23.736
Now, what makes this a binomial variable?

00:01:24.814 --> 00:01:26.289
Well, one of the first conditions

00:01:26.289 --> 00:01:28.845
that's often given for a binomial variable

00:01:28.845 --> 00:01:31.324
is that it's made up of a finite number

00:01:31.324 --> 00:01:33.930
of independent trials.

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:34.928
So,

00:01:34.928 --> 00:01:35.928
it's made up

00:01:36.934 --> 00:01:37.767
made up of

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:40.657
independent

00:01:43.471 --> 00:01:45.862
independent trials.

00:01:45.862 --> 00:01:49.535
Now, what do I mean by independent trials?

00:01:49.535 --> 00:01:52.505
Well, a trial is each flip of my coin.

00:01:52.505 --> 00:01:53.338
So a flip

00:01:54.548 --> 00:01:56.741
is equal to a trial

00:01:56.741 --> 00:01:59.694
in the language of this
statement that I just made.

00:01:59.694 --> 00:02:02.836
And what do I mean by each flip

00:02:02.836 --> 00:02:06.233
or each trial being independent?

00:02:06.233 --> 00:02:09.123
Well the probability of
whether I get heads or tails

00:02:09.123 --> 00:02:10.904
on each flip

00:02:10.904 --> 00:02:14.322
are independent of whether
I just got heads or tails

00:02:14.322 --> 00:02:16.201
on some previous flip.

00:02:16.201 --> 00:02:17.977
So, in this case, we are made up of

00:02:17.977 --> 00:02:19.560
independent trials.

00:02:20.514 --> 00:02:22.114
Now, another condition is

00:02:22.114 --> 00:02:25.179
each trial can be clearly classified

00:02:25.179 --> 00:02:27.190
as either a success or failure.

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:28.460
Or another way of thinking about it:

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:33.386
Each trial clearly has one
of two discreet outcomes.

00:02:33.386 --> 00:02:34.553
So each trial,

00:02:36.003 --> 00:02:37.337
and the example I'm giving,

00:02:37.337 --> 00:02:39.254
the flip is a trial,

00:02:39.254 --> 00:02:40.671
can be classified

00:02:44.197 --> 00:02:45.030
classified

00:02:46.089 --> 00:02:47.715
as

00:02:47.715 --> 00:02:48.548
either

00:02:49.632 --> 00:02:50.465
success

00:02:52.365 --> 00:02:53.282
or failure.

00:02:55.139 --> 00:02:57.867
So, in the context of
this random variable X,

00:02:57.867 --> 00:03:00.416
we could define heads as a success

00:03:00.416 --> 00:03:03.564
because that's what we
are happening to count up.

00:03:03.564 --> 00:03:06.267
And so you're either going
to have success or failure.

00:03:06.267 --> 00:03:09.007
You're either going to have heads or tails

00:03:09.007 --> 00:03:11.686
on each of these trials.

00:03:11.686 --> 00:03:15.111
Now another condition for
being a binomial variable

00:03:15.111 --> 00:03:17.902
is that you have a fixed number of trials.

00:03:17.902 --> 00:03:19.036
Fixed

00:03:19.036 --> 00:03:20.312
number

00:03:20.312 --> 00:03:21.712
of

00:03:21.712 --> 00:03:22.889
trials.

00:03:22.889 --> 00:03:23.911
So in this case,

00:03:23.911 --> 00:03:26.555
we're saying that we have ten trials,

00:03:26.555 --> 00:03:28.388
ten flips of our coin.

00:03:29.533 --> 00:03:33.366
And then the last condition
is the probability

00:03:36.129 --> 00:03:37.046
of success,

00:03:38.654 --> 00:03:40.779
in this context success is a heads,

00:03:40.779 --> 00:03:41.946
on each trial,

00:03:44.482 --> 00:03:45.399
each trial,

00:03:46.362 --> 00:03:47.362
is constant.

00:03:49.224 --> 00:03:50.163
And we've already talked about it.

00:03:50.163 --> 00:03:51.948
On each trial on each flip,

00:03:51.948 --> 00:03:53.061
the probability of heads

00:03:53.061 --> 00:03:55.958
is going to stay at zero point six.

00:03:55.958 --> 00:03:57.756
If for some reason that were to change

00:03:57.756 --> 00:03:59.434
from trial to trial,

00:03:59.434 --> 00:04:01.277
maybe if you were to swap the coin

00:04:01.277 --> 00:04:03.803
and each coin had a different probability

00:04:03.803 --> 00:04:08.006
then this would no longer
be a binomial variable.

00:04:08.006 --> 00:04:08.839
And so you might say,

00:04:08.839 --> 00:04:09.761
"Okay, that's reasonable,

00:04:09.761 --> 00:04:12.477
I get why this is a binomial variable.

00:04:12.477 --> 00:04:13.310
Can you give me an example

00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:16.157
of something that is not
a binomial variable?"

00:04:16.157 --> 00:04:20.083
Well let's say that I were
to define the variable Y

00:04:20.083 --> 00:04:23.166
and it's equal to the number of kings

00:04:27.197 --> 00:04:28.030
after

00:04:29.355 --> 00:04:30.188
taking

00:04:31.648 --> 00:04:32.481
two cards

00:04:34.072 --> 00:04:35.443
from

00:04:35.443 --> 00:04:38.126
a standard deck of cards.

00:04:38.126 --> 00:04:39.293
Standard deck.

00:04:40.737 --> 00:04:42.377
Without replacement.

00:04:42.377 --> 00:04:44.044
Without replacement.

00:04:46.392 --> 00:04:47.395
So you might immediately say,

00:04:47.395 --> 00:04:50.645
"Well, this feels like
it could be binomial."

00:04:50.645 --> 00:04:53.472
We have...each trial can be classified

00:04:53.472 --> 00:04:55.342
as either a success or failure.

00:04:55.342 --> 00:04:58.030
Each trial is when I take a card out.

00:04:58.030 --> 00:05:00.937
If I get a king that looks
like that would be a success.

00:05:00.937 --> 00:05:03.650
If I don't get a king
that would be a failure.

00:05:03.650 --> 00:05:06.619
So it seems to meet that right over there.

00:05:06.619 --> 00:05:08.524
It has a fixed number of trials.

00:05:08.524 --> 00:05:10.533
I'm taking two cards out of the deck

00:05:10.533 --> 00:05:12.951
so it seems to meet that.

00:05:12.951 --> 00:05:14.586
But what about these conditions

00:05:14.586 --> 00:05:16.778
that it's made up of independent trials

00:05:16.778 --> 00:05:19.147
or that the probability
of success on each trial

00:05:19.147 --> 00:05:20.147
is constant?

00:05:21.059 --> 00:05:22.102
Well,

00:05:22.102 --> 00:05:23.335
if I get a king

00:05:23.335 --> 00:05:25.786
the probability of king
on the first trial,

00:05:25.786 --> 00:05:27.647
probability I say king

00:05:27.647 --> 00:05:28.814
on first trial

00:05:31.037 --> 00:05:32.703
would be equal to, well,

00:05:32.703 --> 00:05:34.909
out of a deck of 52 cards,

00:05:34.909 --> 00:05:37.438
you're going to have four kings in it.

00:05:37.438 --> 00:05:40.300
So the probability of a
king on the first trial

00:05:40.300 --> 00:05:42.789
would be four out of 52.

00:05:42.789 --> 00:05:45.646
But what about the
probability of getting a king

00:05:45.646 --> 00:05:46.729
on the second

00:05:47.932 --> 00:05:50.053
on the second trial?

00:05:50.053 --> 00:05:51.907
What would this be equal to?

00:05:51.907 --> 00:05:55.969
Well, it depends on what
happened on the first trial.

00:05:55.969 --> 00:05:58.710
If the first trial you had a king,

00:05:58.710 --> 00:05:59.850
well then you would have,

00:05:59.850 --> 00:06:01.735
so let's see, this would be the situation

00:06:01.735 --> 00:06:03.824
given first trial,

00:06:03.824 --> 00:06:05.518
first king,

00:06:05.518 --> 00:06:08.375
well now there would be three kings left

00:06:08.375 --> 00:06:10.208
in a deck of 51 cards.

00:06:12.154 --> 00:06:14.419
But if you did not get a
king on the first trial,

00:06:14.419 --> 00:06:18.769
now you have four kings
in a deck of 51 cards

00:06:18.769 --> 00:06:20.666
because, remember, we're
doing it without replacement.

00:06:20.666 --> 00:06:22.933
You're just taking that
first card, whatever you did,

00:06:22.933 --> 00:06:25.424
and you're taking it aside.

00:06:25.424 --> 00:06:27.090
So what's interesting here is

00:06:27.090 --> 00:06:29.590
this is not made up of independent trials.

00:06:29.590 --> 00:06:31.426
It does not meet this condition.

00:06:31.426 --> 00:06:33.338
The probability on your second trial

00:06:33.338 --> 00:06:37.194
is dependent on what
happens on your first trial.

00:06:37.194 --> 00:06:38.279
And another way to think about it

00:06:38.279 --> 00:06:41.430
is because we aren't replacing
each card that we're picking,

00:06:41.430 --> 00:06:43.399
the probability of success on each trial

00:06:43.399 --> 00:06:45.824
also is not constant.

00:06:45.824 --> 00:06:48.594
And so that's why this right over here

00:06:48.594 --> 00:06:50.844
is not a binomial variable.

00:06:52.204 --> 00:06:53.650
Now, if Y,

00:06:53.650 --> 00:06:55.564
if we got rid of

00:06:55.564 --> 00:06:56.868
without replacement

00:06:56.868 --> 00:07:00.818
and if we said we did replace
every card after we picked it

00:07:00.818 --> 00:07:02.905
then things would be different.

00:07:02.905 --> 00:07:06.228
Then we actually would be
looking at a binomial variable.

00:07:06.228 --> 00:07:08.050
So instead of without replacement

00:07:08.050 --> 00:07:10.736
if I just said with replacement,

00:07:10.736 --> 00:07:14.216
well then your probability
of a king on each trial

00:07:14.216 --> 00:07:17.271
is going to be four out of 52.

00:07:17.271 --> 00:07:19.427
You have a finite number of trials.

00:07:19.427 --> 00:07:22.490
You're probability of success
is going to stay constant

00:07:22.490 --> 00:07:24.971
and they would be independent.

00:07:24.971 --> 00:07:27.664
And obviously each trial
could easily be classified

00:07:27.664 --> 00:07:30.393
as either a success or a failure.
