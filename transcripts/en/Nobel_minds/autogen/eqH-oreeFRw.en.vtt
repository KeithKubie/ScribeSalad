in my high school days I didn't find the

in my high school days I didn't find the
 

00:00:05.879 --> 00:00:08.750
in my high school days I didn't find the
physics that I was talk very interesting

00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:08.760
physics that I was talk very interesting

physics that I was talk very interesting
I was I was better at mathematics and

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:13.500
I was I was better at mathematics and

level and gradually I came to know that
 

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:32.749
level and gradually I came to know that
there were deeper levels and that these

00:00:32.749 --> 00:00:32.759
there were deeper levels and that these
 

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:36.229
there were deeper levels and that these
these were classified as physics and

00:00:36.229 --> 00:00:36.239
these were classified as physics and
 

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:38.720
these were classified as physics and
there was an interesting thing we're

were lectures for the public to tell

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:04.409
were lectures for the public to tell
 

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:05.929
were lectures for the public to tell
them what what was the background of

00:02:05.929 --> 00:02:05.939
them what what was the background of
 

00:02:05.939 --> 00:02:08.479
them what what was the background of
these these the development of these

these these the development of these
 

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:12.860
these these the development of these
bombs and it is a great success

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:12.870
bombs and it is a great success
 

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:16.460
bombs and it is a great success
series of lectures and the experimental

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:16.470
series of lectures and the experimental
 

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:20.000

in experimental particle physics in

00:02:22.369 --> 00:02:22.379
in experimental particle physics in
 

00:02:22.379 --> 00:02:24.619
in experimental particle physics in
those days it involves sending packages

00:02:24.619 --> 00:02:24.629
those days it involves sending packages
 

00:02:24.629 --> 00:02:27.380
those days it involves sending packages
of photographic emulsion up into the

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:27.390
of photographic emulsion up into the
 

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:28.820
of photographic emulsion up into the
upper atmosphere with the help of

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:28.830
upper atmosphere with the help of
 

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:33.110
upper atmosphere with the help of
balloons and he decided to give some

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:33.120
balloons and he decided to give some
 

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:35.660
balloons and he decided to give some
lectures about his own work which I then

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:35.670
lectures about his own work which I then
 

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:38.960
lectures about his own work which I then
went to when I learned from him a lot

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:38.970
went to when I learned from him a lot
 

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:41.149
went to when I learned from him a lot
about the current state of experiment in

00:02:41.149 --> 00:02:41.159
about the current state of experiment in
 

00:02:41.159 --> 00:02:43.610
about the current state of experiment in
particle physics and that helped me to

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:43.620
particle physics and that helped me to
 

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:47.450
particle physics and that helped me to
see what I wanted to do
