[inaudible]

2
00:00:08.660 --> 00:00:11.090
<v 1>in the last lesson I proposed that the nouns,</v>

3
00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:16.070
cases and the thematic rules of arguments might be two different things.

4
00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:16.881
Now,

5
00:00:16.881 --> 00:00:21.110
I'd like to illustrate that distinction with some examples and make this really

6
00:00:21.111 --> 00:00:23.630
clear as we move on to considering alignment.

7
00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:27.110
Let's look at some sentences in Katelyn,

8
00:00:27.530 --> 00:00:31.460
a language spoken in eastern Spain and some sentences in Basque,

9
00:00:31.670 --> 00:00:36.670
which is a completely separate language spoken in northern Spain in Basque.

10
00:00:36.771 --> 00:00:41.771
The sentence Unic Bailey could see [inaudible] means John has seen Peter the

11
00:00:42.501 --> 00:00:44.150
sentence be your CUNY.

12
00:00:44.151 --> 00:00:49.151
Goosey do means Peter has seen John will translate those sentences into Katelyn

13
00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:55.520
as one by they will look better and and better by Belden one.

14
00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:57.620
In all of those sentences,

15
00:00:57.950 --> 00:01:02.600
we can see that the subject and the object are clearly marked. They're distinct.

16
00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:04.610
This is something we'd expect,

17
00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:08.690
but something different happens when we look at in transitive verbs in the two

18
00:01:08.691 --> 00:01:13.550
languages in Basque, let's use the example your narrowed eda

19
00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:18.440
and in Katelyn, the parallel example is one bug elder.

20
00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:24.280
Both of these sentences mean John fell in English in Catalan.

21
00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:29.870
The subject of this sentence works exactly like the subject of the transitive

22
00:01:29.871 --> 00:01:32.000
sentence in Basque.

23
00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:35.570
It works exactly like the object of the transitive sentence.

24
00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:38.300
This supports the idea I put forth earlier,

25
00:01:38.301 --> 00:01:41.930
which is that cases and roles are treated as distinct.

26
00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:46.190
If we look at the roles of those sentences with the verb C,

27
00:01:46.191 --> 00:01:49.340
we have an agent in a patient with the verb fell.

28
00:01:49.341 --> 00:01:52.070
We have an experiencer in Catalan.

29
00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:55.460
The agent and the experience or role are treated identically.

30
00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:57.800
They're filled with a noun. In this same case,

31
00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:01.700
while the patient role is filled with a different case in Basque,

32
00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:05.510
the agent role is filled with a different case than the patient and the

33
00:02:05.511 --> 00:02:10.511
experience or roles we ended with now in roles filled with nouns from different

34
00:02:10.761 --> 00:02:14.120
cases in different languages. Of course,

35
00:02:14.121 --> 00:02:18.560
there are names for these two alignments. The first gets called nominative,

36
00:02:18.561 --> 00:02:21.710
accusative and the second is [inaudible]. Absolutely,

37
00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:25.580
and these aren't the only ways languages have of handling alignment either.

38
00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:29.840
I hope you've been able to strengthen your understanding of grammar.

39
00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:34.610
Take the time to review my other linguistics lessons and subscribe to learn some

40
00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:37.880
interesting stuff about language. Thanks for learning with me.
