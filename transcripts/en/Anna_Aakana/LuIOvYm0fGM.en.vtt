00:00:00.333 --> 00:00:02.556
Every girl wakes up knowing that someday,

00:00:02.556 --> 00:00:04.741
death's sweet embrace will come for her.

00:00:04.741 --> 00:00:07.477
And we hope that he'll look like a 
well-oiled muscle machine.

00:00:07.477 --> 00:00:10.038
But if not, maybe a cat on a unicorn.

00:00:10.038 --> 00:00:12.046
You'll wanna spend a majority of your life

00:00:12.046 --> 00:00:14.206
fearing growing older, and adamantly

00:00:14.206 --> 00:00:17.568
fighting it with anti-aging serums, 
cosmetic enhancements,

00:00:17.568 --> 00:00:19.392
and healthy eating and exercise.

00:00:19.392 --> 00:00:21.915
Make sure you're driven by the 
fear of becoming unfuckable

00:00:21.915 --> 00:00:24.007
and fading into irrelevant obscurity.

00:00:24.007 --> 00:00:27.757
Frantically try to find a partner in life so you can
avoid the fearsome nursing homes and solitude

00:00:27.757 --> 00:00:31.162
and old age that you witness being shoved under
the rug in society.

00:00:31.162 --> 00:00:31.946
Eventually,

00:00:31.946 --> 00:00:33.298
you'll have periods of rest.

00:00:33.298 --> 00:00:35.690
Where you fully believe that you are invincible,

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:38.874
immortal, and that death happens to everyone else.

00:00:38.874 --> 00:00:39.892
But not you.

00:00:39.892 --> 00:00:41.270
(dramatic music)
Then, just as quickly,

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:44.455
you'll realize that everything is meaningless, 
since our lives are nothing but a blink of an eye

00:00:44.455 --> 00:00:47.976
in the universe, and you'll be fueled with the 
desire to make your mark on the world

00:00:47.976 --> 00:00:50.447
and fulfill a purpose or destiny.

00:00:50.447 --> 00:00:52.634
This is often workaholicism.

00:00:52.634 --> 00:00:55.206
As you get older, perhaps you'll see death,

00:00:55.206 --> 00:00:58.253
riding on by on his cat-controlled unicorn,

00:00:58.253 --> 00:01:00.266
winking and waving and whispering,

00:01:00.266 --> 00:01:01.767
"You're next."

00:01:01.767 --> 00:01:05.237
These encounters will simultaneously 
calm and scare you shitless.

00:01:05.237 --> 00:01:08.128
You will spend so many nights in an existential crisis,

00:01:08.128 --> 00:01:11.267
questioning everything and receiving no answers..

00:01:11.267 --> 00:01:16.139
The best course of action here is to just accept
the inevitable darkness that consumes us all.

00:01:16.139 --> 00:01:18.308
(light music)
The best way any girl can get ready for death

00:01:18.308 --> 00:01:21.860
is not necessarily to live like 
life is short, because it's not,

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:27.013
but you also don't wanna err on the side of being
overly cautious, and regret not taking risks.

00:01:27.013 --> 00:01:28.893
The happy medium is between the two.

00:01:28.893 --> 00:01:32.298
Not being afraid of the trivial, like 
confessing your love to someone,

00:01:32.298 --> 00:01:34.038
but being cautious in a good way,

00:01:34.038 --> 00:01:37.675
such as cutting out people in your life 
who don't truly care for you.

00:01:37.675 --> 00:01:41.391
Though death should be kept somewhere in the back
of your mind as a little reminder to cherish

00:01:41.391 --> 00:01:43.296
what and who you have now,

00:01:43.296 --> 00:01:45.069
don't let it be a force of fear.

00:01:45.069 --> 00:01:47.416
All bad things, all good things,

00:01:47.416 --> 00:01:48.507
all things,

00:01:48.507 --> 00:01:49.829
come to an end.

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:51.343
So have some fun.

00:01:51.343 --> 00:02:00.917
