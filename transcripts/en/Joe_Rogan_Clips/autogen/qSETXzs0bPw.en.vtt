choice about half and half I would say
mmm overall on average across traits how

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:07.680
mmm overall on average across traits how
 

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:09.229
mmm overall on average across traits how
much do you think gets passed down

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:09.239
much do you think gets passed down
 

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:12.030

through genetics and terms

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:12.040
through genetics and terms
 

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:15.000
through genetics and terms
inclinations like like the new

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:15.010
inclinations like like the new
 

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:18.630
inclinations like like the new
transition yes about half on average so

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:18.640
transition yes about half on average so
 

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:20.670
transition yes about half on average so
for example about half the very you know

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:20.680
for example about half the very you know
 

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:23.100

how religious you are or how risk-averse

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:23.110
how religious you are or how risk-averse
 

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:26.399
how religious you are or how risk-averse
you are like I can I can about half the

00:02:26.399 --> 00:02:26.409
you are like I can I can about half the
 

00:02:26.409 --> 00:02:27.990
you are like I can I can about half the
variation and how if you look at a group

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:28.000
variation and how if you look at a group
 

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:29.970
variation and how if you look at a group
of people and some are more risk-averse

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:29.980
of people and some are more risk-averse
 

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:31.860
of people and some are more risk-averse
than others about about half of that has

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:31.870
than others about about half of that has
 

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:33.270
than others about about half of that has
to do with their genes and half has to

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:33.280
to do with their genes and half has to
 

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:34.440
to do with their genes and half has to
do with how they were raised or what

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:34.450
do with how they were raised or what
 

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:37.199
do with how they were raised or what
environments they grew up in so you know

qualities and you can shape them you

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:41.650
qualities and you can shape them you
 

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:43.170
qualities and you can shape them you
know for example you can't you couldn't

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:43.180

both yeah always almost in every single
trait actually well that's the case of

00:04:08.909 --> 00:04:08.919
trait actually well that's the case of
 

00:04:08.919 --> 00:04:10.860
trait actually well that's the case of
so many things in this life we wanted

into two categories but in fact many
 

00:04:46.190 --> 00:04:48.550
into two categories but in fact many
times not always like up and down is

00:04:48.550 --> 00:04:48.560
times not always like up and down is
 

00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:50.920
times not always like up and down is
sort of clear right but many times it

00:04:50.920 --> 00:04:50.930
sort of clear right but many times it
