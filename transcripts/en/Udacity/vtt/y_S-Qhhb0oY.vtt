Now, unlike our usual ending to the lesson with a recap, let's try to meditate

00:00:03.964 --> 00:00:10.050
and see if you can do it and you can leave in a stress free, relaxed state.

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:15.232
First, you want to sit with your eyes closed in a comfortable position. Slowly

00:00:15.232 --> 00:00:21.313
breathe in for a count of four. Hold for two seconds and then breath through

00:00:21.313 --> 00:00:27.102
your nose releasing. You want to take long breaths in and then long breaths

00:00:27.102 --> 00:00:31.904
out. While you're breathing, remember to try to not let anything pop into your

00:00:31.904 --> 00:00:35.384
head, it maybe helpful to think about the ocean waves coming in as you're

00:00:35.384 --> 00:00:42.127
breathing. And then as your exhaling, the wave's going back out. Try to do this

00:00:42.127 --> 00:00:47.152
for five minutes a day, moving up to fifty minutes a day. Research has shown

00:00:47.152 --> 00:00:50.600
that if you can meditate, you may be able to reduce your stress levels
