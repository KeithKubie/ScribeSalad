00:00:00.340 --> 00:00:01.810
3D printing is so cool.

00:00:01.810 --> 00:00:05.610
As the technology gets cheaper and better,
it won’t cost an arm and leg, but it certainly

00:00:05.610 --> 00:00:07.770
could make one!

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:12.482
Hey guys Julia here for DNews

00:00:12.482 --> 00:00:17.180
3D printing technology is getting crazier
by the day, from ballgowns, to bicycles, to

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:20.070
instruments, seems like anything can be printed
out of plastic.

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:24.680
One of the best things to come from this technology
is it’s ability to improve the design of

00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:25.730
artificial limbs.

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:29.380
We’ve talked before on DNews about how 3D
printed limbs could help people.

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:30.710
But what about animals?

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:34.350
Oh yes here’s some adorable ways 3D printing
has saved animals.

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:38.610
Derby the dog can play fetch with his best
friends thanks to 3D printed legs.

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:41.780
You see this particular pooch was born with
deformed front legs.

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:46.059
His foster mom rescued him from a shelter
and refused to let his disability define him.

00:00:46.059 --> 00:00:49.790
He first got fitted with a cute little cart
which supported his upper body, but unfortunately

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:53.360
limited his movement, he had to stick to sidewalks
and he couldn’t use stairs.

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:57.899
3D Systems, a company based out of South Carolina
designed artificial legs for Derby.

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:00.940
But unlike a cart system, these prosthetics
are designed for running!

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:04.050
They look like the blades paralympic athletes
might wear.

00:01:04.050 --> 00:01:06.939
Now this lucky dog can frolic through the
grass with the best of them.

00:01:06.939 --> 00:01:08.990
And 3D printing is for the birds too!

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:13.249
Tieta, a female tucan lost a huge chunk of
her beak while being trafficked in Rio de

00:01:13.249 --> 00:01:14.249
Janeiro.

00:01:14.249 --> 00:01:18.130
Leaving her unable to eat properly or fend
for herself, she could only eat by throwing

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:20.200
food into the air trying to catch it.

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:21.759
Which didn’t work so well.

00:01:21.759 --> 00:01:23.479
Only about a third of the time.

00:01:23.479 --> 00:01:24.479
Thankfully she was rescued.

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:29.189
In a team effort between a wildlife management
group Instituto Vida Livre and three Brazilian

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:31.280
universities, Tieta got a new lease on life.

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:35.289
The team used a deceased bird’s beak as
a model to design a new one for Tieta.

00:01:35.289 --> 00:01:38.829
In just two hours of printing and 40 minutes
of surgery she was almost as good as new.

00:01:38.829 --> 00:01:40.680
It’s a light beak, weighing only 4g.

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:44.740
It’s basically a small 3D printed plastic
piece that’s then, covered with nail polish

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:47.740
and sealed with a special polymer made from
the castor oil plant.

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:51.039
She’s still unfortunately not fit enough
to survive in the wild, but she’s a lot

00:01:51.039 --> 00:01:52.149
better than she was!

00:01:52.149 --> 00:01:55.350
Now she can eat normally and even use her
beak to clean herself.

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:58.819
Beauty the Bald Eagle lost the top of her
beak thanks to a shot from a poacher.

00:01:58.819 --> 00:02:02.929
Left to die in Alaska, she was rescued by
raptor biologist Janie (Fink) Veltkamp.

00:02:02.929 --> 00:02:07.240
While some birds can regrow their beaks, experts
didn’t think hers would, and many recommended

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:08.459
the bird be euthanized.

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:10.750
But Veltkamp wasn’t ready to give up hope
yet.

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:15.060
In a fateful meeting with engineer Nate Calvin,
the two hatched a plan to help get Beauty

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:16.060
a new beak.

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:19.150
Thanks to a volunteer team of specialists,
Beauty was fitted with a 3D printed upper

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:20.450
beak in 2008.

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:23.000
She could feed herself and preen and just
be a big happy bird.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:26.120
But in the past 7 years, her natural beak
has partially regrown!

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:29.610
While it’s still not at it’s original
shape and size, she can now eat salmon all

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:31.530
by herself without the prosthetic.

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:35.140
Probably my favorite though is the story of
Winter.

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:38.819
Nearly ten years ago a young dolphin was found
caught up in a crab fishing net.

00:02:38.819 --> 00:02:42.050
Suffering extensive damage to her tail, it
had to be amputated.

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:45.250
For two years she depended on her human caretakers
for nearly everything.

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:49.640
But a great team of handlers and scientists
came together design her a new tail in 2007.

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:53.690
Since then a movie WITH MORGAN FREEMAN was
made about her story.

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:57.219
She lives at the Clearwater Marine Aquarium
in Clearwater, Fla. where she continues to

00:02:57.219 --> 00:02:58.670
inspire millions today.

00:02:58.670 --> 00:03:01.609
It doesn’t take an expert to help an animal
in need.

00:03:01.609 --> 00:03:03.560
Stumpy the turtle lost her leg due to infection.

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:08.140
But rather than let her spend her remaining
years hobbling around, a group of six elementary

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:10.829
students in Savannah Georgia had a better
idea.

00:03:10.829 --> 00:03:14.870
After being inspired by another lucky turtle
with a lego prosthetic, the students designed

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:17.819
a ball caster like leg that attaches to her
shell.

00:03:17.819 --> 00:03:20.749
A design which can help her easily move in
any direction.

00:03:20.749 --> 00:03:23.980
Using their school’s 3D printer, and a little
help from their teacher, they helped Stumpy

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:27.269
be not so stumpy anymore, maybe she should
be called Rolly.

00:03:27.269 --> 00:03:33.901
While most of these are heart warming stories,
3D printing is insanely awesome.

00:03:33.901 --> 00:03:38.030
Not only does the technology enable a faster,
cheaper, and easier way to make things, it

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:39.620
allows for custom designs.

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:41.190
A game changer for prosthetics.

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:45.459
It can be super expensive if prosthetics wear
out and break and need a replacement part.

00:03:45.459 --> 00:03:47.810
Now a new part can be printed in a number
of hours!

00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:51.410
And as the technology gets easier and more
affordable, now almost anyone can help an

00:03:51.410 --> 00:03:52.410
animal in need.

00:03:52.410 --> 00:03:56.260
You know what else makes us feel all warm
and fuzzy about the future?

00:03:56.260 --> 00:04:00.340
Intel creates the breakthrough technologies
that make amazing experiences possible.

00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:03.560
Having Intel inside makes for better experiences
outside.

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:07.600
Intel drives innovation with products like
processors, wearables and IOT devices, and

00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:08.969
within data centers.

00:04:08.969 --> 00:04:10.739
In the PC and beyond.

00:04:10.739 --> 00:04:14.269
So what do you think the coolest thing ever
printed was? have you ever used one?

00:04:14.269 --> 00:04:16.510
