00:00:00.900 --> 00:00:02.700
Neutron stars, other densities,

2
00:00:02.710 --> 00:00:07.710
things that are not black holes in there cause we might find the most dangerous

3
00:00:08.221 --> 00:00:12.970
substance in existence. Strange matter, a bizarre thing.

4
00:00:13.210 --> 00:00:18.210
So extreme that it bends the rules of the universe and could infect and destroy

5
00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:20.350
everything it comes into contact with.

6
00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:25.600
Or it could teach us about how the universe began. Maybe both.

7
00:00:36.490 --> 00:00:39.160
To understand how extreme strange matter already is,

8
00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:41.140
we first need to get a few basics.

9
00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:46.030
What is a neutron star and how does strange matter break the rules of the

10
00:00:46.031 --> 00:00:49.030
universe? To get all of this into one video,

11
00:00:49.031 --> 00:00:51.220
we'll grossly over simplify a few things,

12
00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:54.550
but we'll provide you with further reading if you want more details.

13
00:00:55.450 --> 00:00:59.650
The neutron star is what remains after a very massive star explodes in a

14
00:00:59.651 --> 00:01:02.050
Supernova. When this happens,

15
00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:06.790
the stars core collapses under its own gravity with such a strong Inwood force

16
00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:11.940
that it squeezes nuclei and particles together violently electrons are pushed

17
00:01:12.071 --> 00:01:15.070
into protons, so they merge and turn into neutrons.

18
00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:20.020
All the nothing inside of atoms is suddenly completely filled with particles

19
00:01:20.021 --> 00:01:23.050
that really don't want to be close to each other but have no choice.

20
00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:27.190
They desperately pushed back against gravity against the collapse.

21
00:01:27.790 --> 00:01:31.660
If gravity wins, they will become a black hole. If they win,

22
00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:33.220
they become a neutron star.

23
00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:38.710
This makes neutron stars like giant atomic nuclei the size of a city,

24
00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:43.300
but holding the mass of our sun and here things get weird.

25
00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:48.100
The environment in the core of neutron stars is so extreme that the rules of

26
00:01:48.101 --> 00:01:53.101
nuclear physics change and this could lead to a strange and extremely dangerous

27
00:01:53.621 --> 00:01:56.830
substance, but let's not get ahead of ourselves.

28
00:01:57.610 --> 00:02:01.000
We first need to know the rules before we learn how they can be broken.

29
00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:03.220
Protons and neutrons,

30
00:02:03.221 --> 00:02:07.030
the particles making up the nuclei of atoms are made up of smaller particles

31
00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:11.020
called quarks. Quarks really don't want to be alone.

32
00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:15.490
They are what we call confined. You can try to separate them,

33
00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:19.360
but the harder you pull, the harder they try to pull themselves back together.

34
00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:24.130
If you use a lot of energy, they just use this energy to create new quarks.

35
00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:29.020
Quarks only exist together as the building blocks of other particles and have

36
00:02:29.021 --> 00:02:30.640
never been observed by themselves.

37
00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:34.900
They come in many types but only to appear to make stable matter.

38
00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:39.130
The up and down quarks found in protons and neutrons.

39
00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:42.160
All other quarks seem to decay away quickly,

40
00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:45.700
but this may be different inside neutron stars.

41
00:02:46.570 --> 00:02:50.620
The forces operating in their cause are so extreme that they are actually

42
00:02:50.621 --> 00:02:55.621
similar to the universe that shortly after the big bang neutron star cores are

43
00:02:55.901 --> 00:02:59.590
like fossils which can let us peer back in time to the beginning. Everything.

44
00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:05.230
So learning how quarks behave inside a neutron star is a way of understanding

45
00:03:05.231 --> 00:03:07.630
the very nature of the universe itself.

46
00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:11.080
One hypothesis is that inside a neutron star,

47
00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:14.100
call protons and neutrons d confinement,

48
00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:18.760
all the particles cram shoulder to shoulder dissolve and melt into a sort of

49
00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:19.870
Barth of quarks.

50
00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:26.010
Uncountable numbers of particles become one giant thing made purely from quarks.

51
00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:31.210
Quark matter, a star made from this is called a quark star.

52
00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:34.810
Though from the outside it may not look any different than a regular neutron

53
00:03:34.811 --> 00:03:39.760
star. Now we can finally talk about the most dangerous substance.

54
00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:42.880
If the pressure and cited quark star is great enough,

55
00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:47.970
it may get stranger literally in the cause of neutron stars.

56
00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:51.880
Some of the quarks may be converted into strange quarks.

57
00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:57.070
Strange quarks have bizarre nuclear properties and they are heavier and for the

58
00:03:57.071 --> 00:04:00.820
lack of a better word, stronger. If they turn up,

59
00:04:00.850 --> 00:04:02.470
they could create strange matter.

60
00:04:03.130 --> 00:04:07.300
Strange matter might be the ideal state of matter, perfectly dense,

61
00:04:07.570 --> 00:04:08.560
perfectly stable,

62
00:04:08.810 --> 00:04:13.030
indestructable more stable than any other matter in the universe,

63
00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:17.170
so stable that it can exist outside neutron stars.

64
00:04:18.070 --> 00:04:22.210
If this is the case, we have a problem, it might be infectious.

65
00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:27.070
Every piece of matter at touches might be so impressed by its stability that it

66
00:04:27.071 --> 00:04:29.380
would immediately turn it into a strange matter. Two,

67
00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:34.720
protons and neutrons would dissolve and become part of the quark bath,

68
00:04:34.750 --> 00:04:37.660
which frees energy and creates more strange matter.

69
00:04:38.890 --> 00:04:42.250
The only way to get rid of it would be to throw it into a black hole,

70
00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:46.960
but then again, who cares? All of it is inside neutron stars,

71
00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:52.000
except when neutron stars collide with other neutron stars, all black holes,

72
00:04:52.330 --> 00:04:54.970
they spew out tremendous amounts of their insights,

73
00:04:55.150 --> 00:04:58.960
some of which could include little droplets of strange matter called strange

74
00:04:59.290 --> 00:05:03.220
lifts. Strange lids are as dense as the core of a neutron star.

75
00:05:04.180 --> 00:05:07.150
They could be really small, maybe even Subatomic,

76
00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:10.630
but even the largest strangely, it's wouldn't be any bigger than a rocket.

77
00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:14.740
These strange lifts would drift through the galaxy for millions or billions of

78
00:05:14.741 --> 00:05:17.740
years until they meet a star or planet. By chance,

79
00:05:18.550 --> 00:05:20.050
if one were to strike earth,

80
00:05:20.140 --> 00:05:23.350
it would immediately start converting it into strange matter.

81
00:05:23.890 --> 00:05:27.280
The more it converts, the more it would grow. Ultimately,

82
00:05:27.340 --> 00:05:29.980
all of the atoms making up earth would be converted.

83
00:05:30.790 --> 00:05:34.840
Earth would become a hot clump of strange matter the size of an astroid.

84
00:05:35.860 --> 00:05:37.690
If a strange lit strikes the sun,

85
00:05:37.930 --> 00:05:42.130
it would collapse into a strange style eating through it like fire through a dry

86
00:05:42.131 --> 00:05:45.730
forest. This would not change the sun's mass mage,

87
00:05:46.030 --> 00:05:47.620
but it will become way less bright.

88
00:05:47.800 --> 00:05:51.520
So earth would freeze to death and like a tiny virus,

89
00:05:51.730 --> 00:05:56.730
we'd have no way to see a strangely coming worse still some theories suggest

90
00:05:57.110 --> 00:06:01.250
strange lifts are more than common outnumbering all stars in the galaxy.

91
00:06:02.240 --> 00:06:06.080
The strange lids could have formed very early after the big bang when it was as

92
00:06:06.081 --> 00:06:11.000
hot and dense as a neutron star core everywhere they might be clumping around.

93
00:06:11.001 --> 00:06:14.840
The gravity of Ganache says as the universe expanded and evolved,

94
00:06:16.010 --> 00:06:20.030
strange Litz could even be so new rose and massive that they might actually be

95
00:06:20.031 --> 00:06:24.200
the dark matter we suspect holds galaxies together. But then again,

96
00:06:24.500 --> 00:06:25.333
maybe not.

97
00:06:25.940 --> 00:06:30.140
This is speculation and the earth and sun and planets haven't been consumed in a

98
00:06:30.141 --> 00:06:32.780
wildfire of strange let's in the past few billion years.

99
00:06:32.990 --> 00:06:35.840
So the odds seem good that it won't happen anytime soon.

<v 0>understanding these strange objects today,</v>

102
00:06:40.480 --> 00:06:44.650
maybe the key to understanding the birth of our universe and why it grew to look

103
00:06:44.651 --> 00:06:45.640
the way it does now.

104
00:06:46.750 --> 00:06:50.920
When scientists first started playing with magnets and wise and thinking about

105
00:06:50.921 --> 00:06:51.754
electrons,

106
00:06:51.790 --> 00:06:55.510
they had no idea how technology would evolve in the next hundred years.

107
00:06:56.380 --> 00:07:00.100
The scientists thinking about the cause of neutron stars and strange matter

108
00:07:00.101 --> 00:07:05.101
today may be setting up humans for a future beyond our wildest imaginations.

109
00:07:05.920 --> 00:07:08.050
Oh, maybe not ton will tell.

110
00:07:09.910 --> 00:07:12.820
So while you're waiting to see if the universe gets destroyed,

111
00:07:13.090 --> 00:07:15.220
you might still want to find out more about it.
