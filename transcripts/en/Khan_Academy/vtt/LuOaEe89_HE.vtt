00:00:00.640 --> 00:00:01.909
- We're now going to talk about one

00:00:01.909 --> 00:00:04.078
of the most famous operons,

00:00:04.078 --> 00:00:06.023
and this is the lac operon,

00:00:06.023 --> 00:00:09.576
and it is part of E. coli's genome

00:00:09.576 --> 00:00:10.543
and it is involved.

00:00:10.543 --> 00:00:14.160
And the lac right over here
is referring to lactose,

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:16.299
and so you can imagine that it codes

00:00:16.299 --> 00:00:20.227
for genes involved in the
metabolism of lactose.

00:00:20.227 --> 00:00:23.146
And the word lactose might
already be familiar to you.

00:00:23.146 --> 00:00:25.611
It is a sugar found in milk.

00:00:25.611 --> 00:00:28.955
Some of us, including myself,
are lactose intolerant.

00:00:28.955 --> 00:00:31.266
I have trouble digesting lactose,

00:00:31.266 --> 00:00:33.432
so I have mixed feelings regarding this.

00:00:33.432 --> 00:00:36.141
But in general, for a
cell to make use of it,

00:00:36.141 --> 00:00:39.173
it needs to be able to absorb the lactose.

00:00:39.173 --> 00:00:41.912
It needs to be able to split
it up into simpler sugars

00:00:41.912 --> 00:00:44.729
that it can actually use for fuel,

00:00:44.729 --> 00:00:46.425
and that is what the genes

00:00:46.425 --> 00:00:49.538
in the lac operon actually do code for.

00:00:49.538 --> 00:00:53.254
So just as an example, the
lac Z gene right over here,

00:00:53.254 --> 00:00:55.017
this codes for an enzyme

00:00:55.017 --> 00:00:59.397
that helps cleave the
lactose into simpler sugars.

00:00:59.397 --> 00:01:02.230
The lac Y gene codes for an enzyme

00:01:03.195 --> 00:01:06.903
that allows for the absorption of lactose

00:01:06.903 --> 00:01:08.435
through cellular membranes.

00:01:08.435 --> 00:01:10.154
Lac A is a little bit more interesting

00:01:10.154 --> 00:01:11.680
and a little less understood,

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:14.957
but the general idea here is
all three of these are involved

00:01:14.957 --> 00:01:18.756
in the metabolism and the
absorption of lactose.

00:01:18.756 --> 00:01:19.939
And it is an operon,

00:01:19.939 --> 00:01:21.393
so we have our promoter here

00:01:21.393 --> 00:01:23.906
where our RNA polymerase would attach,

00:01:23.906 --> 00:01:25.725
and I've also drawn some other sites.

00:01:25.725 --> 00:01:28.528
I've drawn the operator right over here

00:01:28.528 --> 00:01:30.286
where you can imagine a repressor,

00:01:30.286 --> 00:01:34.027
indeed the lac repressor could bind,

00:01:34.027 --> 00:01:37.501
and over here, this CAP
site, or C-A-P site.

00:01:37.501 --> 00:01:41.168
CAP stands for Catabolite
Activator Protein.

00:01:42.077 --> 00:01:43.607
Catabolite,

00:01:43.607 --> 00:01:44.440
Catabolite

00:01:46.106 --> 00:01:47.606
Activator, whoops,

00:01:50.752 --> 00:01:51.585
Activator

00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:54.373
Protein.

00:01:55.287 --> 00:01:56.595
And so this is, you can imagine,

00:01:56.595 --> 00:02:00.994
where a protein, called the
Catabolite Activator Protein,

00:02:00.994 --> 00:02:04.185
can bind and perhaps be an activator.

00:02:04.185 --> 00:02:06.139
So with that out of the way,

00:02:06.139 --> 00:02:08.724
let's think about different scenarios.

00:02:08.724 --> 00:02:11.057
Let's think about a scenario

00:02:12.233 --> 00:02:13.920
where the E. coli is an environment

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:16.087
where there is no lactose.

00:02:17.933 --> 00:02:20.421
So what do you think
should happen over here?

00:02:20.421 --> 00:02:22.208
And a lot of these things are very logical

00:02:22.208 --> 00:02:23.773
if you just assume that a lot

00:02:23.773 --> 00:02:26.067
of biological organisms are quite stingy.

00:02:26.067 --> 00:02:28.552
They don't wanna just waste resources.

00:02:28.552 --> 00:02:30.061
Well, if there's no lactose,

00:02:30.061 --> 00:02:34.804
well, why transcribe the
genes that can be translated

00:02:34.804 --> 00:02:38.001
into enzymes for the
metabolism of lactose?

00:02:38.001 --> 00:02:40.014
So if there's no lactose,
you can almost do this

00:02:40.014 --> 00:02:41.958
as a default state right over here.

00:02:41.958 --> 00:02:46.662
You actually have the lac
repressor protein being bound

00:02:46.662 --> 00:02:48.723
to the operator.

00:02:48.723 --> 00:02:51.140
So this is the lac repressor,

00:02:53.543 --> 00:02:55.894
lac repressor right over there,

00:02:55.894 --> 00:02:59.991
and so you won't be able
to transcribe these things.

00:02:59.991 --> 00:03:03.490
The RNA polymerase won't be
able to get anything done.

00:03:03.490 --> 00:03:05.807
No transcription is going to occur.

00:03:05.807 --> 00:03:08.474
So no lactose, no transcription,

00:03:11.958 --> 00:03:13.941
which makes a lot of sense.

00:03:13.941 --> 00:03:16.486
The bacteria, or the bacterium,

00:03:16.486 --> 00:03:17.465
this is singular,

00:03:17.465 --> 00:03:19.543
doesn't wanna waste resources.

00:03:19.543 --> 00:03:22.942
So what do you think should
happen if there is lactose?

00:03:22.942 --> 00:03:25.235
So I'll keep this up
here so you can see it.

00:03:25.235 --> 00:03:26.818
So lactose present,

00:03:29.929 --> 00:03:31.565
lactose

00:03:31.565 --> 00:03:32.429
present,

00:03:32.429 --> 00:03:33.344
well, you can imagine,

00:03:33.344 --> 00:03:35.297
well, you don't want that
repressor around anymore,

00:03:35.297 --> 00:03:37.437
and that is indeed what happens,

00:03:37.437 --> 00:03:41.637
that you have an isomer of
lactose, called Allolactose.

00:03:41.637 --> 00:03:42.876
So if lactose is present,

00:03:42.876 --> 00:03:45.385
you're going to have
also Allolactose present,

00:03:45.385 --> 00:03:46.802
right over here,

00:03:46.802 --> 00:03:47.969
and so that is

00:03:50.483 --> 00:03:51.483
Allolactose,

00:03:52.711 --> 00:03:56.328
which can act as an
inducer of transcription.

00:03:56.328 --> 00:03:58.558
And the way that it acts as an inducer is

00:03:58.558 --> 00:04:01.848
if it binds to the lac repressor,

00:04:01.848 --> 00:04:06.015
the lac repressor can no longer
bind to the operator site.

00:04:08.258 --> 00:04:10.076
When the Allolactose is present,

00:04:10.076 --> 00:04:12.095
it will bind to the repressor,

00:04:12.095 --> 00:04:17.085
and then the repressor is going
to leave the operator site.

00:04:17.085 --> 00:04:19.206
It's not going to be able to bind as well,

00:04:19.206 --> 00:04:20.240
and so let me draw that.

00:04:20.240 --> 00:04:23.190
So in this case, the operator,

00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:24.652
sorry, the repressor I should say.

00:04:24.652 --> 00:04:26.897
The operator is where the repressor binds.

00:04:26.897 --> 00:04:29.459
So this is the repressor right over here.

00:04:29.459 --> 00:04:32.257
You have some Allolactose.

00:04:32.257 --> 00:04:34.127
We do that in white.

00:04:34.127 --> 00:04:37.330
You have some Allolactose
that has bound to it,

00:04:37.330 --> 00:04:38.201
and because of that,

00:04:38.201 --> 00:04:40.733
it's not going to bind to the operator,

00:04:40.733 --> 00:04:43.145
and since it's not bound to the operator,

00:04:43.145 --> 00:04:43.978
well now,

00:04:43.978 --> 00:04:48.231
the RNA polymerase can actually
transcribe these genes,

00:04:48.231 --> 00:04:49.732
and that's valuable

00:04:49.732 --> 00:04:52.474
because by transcribing these genes,

00:04:52.474 --> 00:04:56.793
we are going to be able to
metabolize this lactose.

00:04:56.793 --> 00:05:00.376
So lactose present,
you have transcription.

00:05:03.163 --> 00:05:04.913
Transcription occurs.

00:05:06.512 --> 00:05:10.450
Now that's a very high level
simple view of the lac operon,

00:05:10.450 --> 00:05:11.990
but there's more involved,

00:05:11.990 --> 00:05:14.525
because there's other sugars,
in particular glucose,

00:05:14.525 --> 00:05:17.905
which is preferred by the cell.

00:05:17.905 --> 00:05:19.304
So, whoops,

00:05:19.304 --> 00:05:20.576
moving the wrong part.

00:05:20.576 --> 00:05:21.737
There you go.

00:05:21.737 --> 00:05:23.144
So let's think about what will happen

00:05:23.144 --> 00:05:24.614
in the presence of glucose

00:05:24.614 --> 00:05:26.888
and not in the presence of glucose.

00:05:26.888 --> 00:05:28.818
So let me write here.

00:05:28.818 --> 00:05:29.735
So glucose,

00:05:34.574 --> 00:05:36.270
and no glucose,

00:05:36.270 --> 00:05:38.103
actually let me do it,

00:05:39.193 --> 00:05:41.431
I'll do no glucose first.

00:05:41.431 --> 00:05:44.159
So let's see, we have no glucose.

00:05:44.159 --> 00:05:47.855
And remember, glucose
is preferred to lactose.

00:05:47.855 --> 00:05:49.200
Simpler sugar.

00:05:49.200 --> 00:05:51.455
If you have glucose around,
why worry about the lactose?

00:05:51.455 --> 00:05:53.955
And then here we have glucose.

00:05:55.712 --> 00:05:58.203
We have glucose around.

00:05:58.203 --> 00:06:01.366
And we could talk about
both of these situations

00:06:01.366 --> 00:06:02.688
in the presence of lactose

00:06:02.688 --> 00:06:04.417
or not in the presence of lactose,

00:06:04.417 --> 00:06:06.970
but if we don't any lactose around,

00:06:06.970 --> 00:06:08.901
then were not gonna have
the Allolactose around,

00:06:08.901 --> 00:06:10.732
and then you're just gonna
have the repressor sit

00:06:10.732 --> 00:06:11.565
on the operator,

00:06:11.565 --> 00:06:14.145
and you're not going to
have any transcription,

00:06:14.145 --> 00:06:16.622
and that's going to be whether
or not we have glucose.

00:06:16.622 --> 00:06:18.597
So I'm gonna think about no glucose,

00:06:18.597 --> 00:06:20.796
but we do have lactose,

00:06:20.796 --> 00:06:21.879
plus lactose,

00:06:23.250 --> 00:06:26.833
and in here, you have
glucose plus lactose.

00:06:28.783 --> 00:06:30.595
Well, the lactose part,

00:06:30.595 --> 00:06:32.407
if we have lactose around then we're going

00:06:32.407 --> 00:06:34.694
to have the Allolactose around,

00:06:34.694 --> 00:06:36.850
and we just covered this scenario.

00:06:36.850 --> 00:06:40.433
The Allolactose binds
to the lac repressor,

00:06:41.821 --> 00:06:45.988
keeps the lac repressor from
binding to the operator,

00:06:47.637 --> 00:06:50.554
and so you have your RNA polymerase

00:06:51.844 --> 00:06:55.375
is able to actually
perform the transcription.

00:06:55.375 --> 00:06:57.587
But that's not it.

00:06:57.587 --> 00:06:59.619
In a situation with no glucose,

00:06:59.619 --> 00:07:02.500
you actually are going to
also involve the CAP site.

00:07:02.500 --> 00:07:04.135
You're going to have an
activator that's going

00:07:04.135 --> 00:07:05.850
to make this happen even more,

00:07:05.850 --> 00:07:07.748
because if you don't have glucose around,

00:07:07.748 --> 00:07:10.868
man, you really need that lactose.

00:07:10.868 --> 00:07:13.803
And so, what you have is something called,

00:07:13.803 --> 00:07:15.224
so let me draw this,

00:07:15.224 --> 00:07:18.205
the Catabolite Activator Protein,

00:07:18.205 --> 00:07:20.080
right over here.

00:07:20.080 --> 00:07:23.089
The Catabolite Activator Protein,

00:07:23.089 --> 00:07:25.922
and in the presence of Cyclic AMP,

00:07:28.924 --> 00:07:30.566
Adenosine Monophosphate.

00:07:30.566 --> 00:07:33.281
It's a derivative of ATP,

00:07:33.281 --> 00:07:34.817
and so this is that right over there,

00:07:34.817 --> 00:07:35.734
Cyclic AMP.

00:07:37.240 --> 00:07:40.175
You'll see that come up a lot in biology.

00:07:40.175 --> 00:07:44.186
So this is the Catabolite
Activator Protein,

00:07:44.186 --> 00:07:46.611
in the presence of C AMP,

00:07:46.611 --> 00:07:49.638
and we'll talk about
how Cyclic AMP relates

00:07:49.638 --> 00:07:51.372
to glucose in a second.

00:07:51.372 --> 00:07:52.704
In that presence,

00:07:52.704 --> 00:07:56.565
it is going to bind to this, the CAP site,

00:07:56.565 --> 00:08:00.505
and it is going to further
activate the transcription.

00:08:00.505 --> 00:08:03.659
So in this situation,
no glucose plus lactose,

00:08:03.659 --> 00:08:06.191
you're going to have
even more transcription.

00:08:06.191 --> 00:08:07.396
So let me write this down.

00:08:07.396 --> 00:08:09.229
Lots of transcription.

00:08:16.080 --> 00:08:18.028
Lots of transcription.

00:08:18.028 --> 00:08:19.413
Now, I know what you're probably asking.

00:08:19.413 --> 00:08:20.833
This is what I first asked myself

00:08:20.833 --> 00:08:23.383
when people told me about Cyclic AMP,

00:08:23.383 --> 00:08:26.367
"Well, how does Cyclic
AMP relate to glucose?"

00:08:26.367 --> 00:08:29.860
Well, I'm not gonna go into
a huge amount of detail here,

00:08:29.860 --> 00:08:31.232
but what you need to know here,

00:08:31.232 --> 00:08:32.390
and it makes sense,

00:08:32.390 --> 00:08:35.010
is that if you have glucose,

00:08:35.010 --> 00:08:36.512
so let me write it this way.

00:08:36.512 --> 00:08:38.610
If you have high glucose,

00:08:38.610 --> 00:08:40.323
high glucose.

00:08:40.323 --> 00:08:41.685
I'm having trouble writing.

00:08:41.685 --> 00:08:43.498
High glucose,

00:08:43.498 --> 00:08:47.784
then that's going to inhibit
the production of Cyclic AMP,

00:08:47.784 --> 00:08:50.951
so low Cyclic adenosine monophosphate.

00:08:53.561 --> 00:08:57.565
And if you have low
glucose, or no glucose,

00:08:57.565 --> 00:08:58.851
it's like a tongue twister.

00:08:58.851 --> 00:09:00.045
If you have low glucose,

00:09:00.045 --> 00:09:01.712
well, you're not going
to inhibit the creation

00:09:01.712 --> 00:09:02.908
of Cyclic AMP,

00:09:02.908 --> 00:09:06.575
and so you're going to
have high Cyclic AMP.

00:09:07.970 --> 00:09:10.172
So if you have no glucose, or low glucose,

00:09:10.172 --> 00:09:12.461
we are in this scenario right over here.

00:09:12.461 --> 00:09:16.345
You're going to have higher
concentrations of Cyclic AMP,

00:09:16.345 --> 00:09:21.060
which can bind to the
Catabolite Activator Protein,

00:09:21.060 --> 00:09:23.255
which then acts as an activator

00:09:23.255 --> 00:09:27.344
to allow even more
transcription of the lac operon.

00:09:27.344 --> 00:09:28.995
Which, once again, why is it important?

00:09:28.995 --> 00:09:30.679
Well, if there's no
glucose or low glucose,

00:09:30.679 --> 00:09:32.550
you're really going to need that lactose.

00:09:32.550 --> 00:09:37.249
You really wanna transcribe
these genes as much as possible.

00:09:37.249 --> 00:09:38.793
Now, what about the situation

00:09:38.793 --> 00:09:41.807
where there is glucose and lactose?

00:09:41.807 --> 00:09:43.719
Well once again, if there is lactose,

00:09:43.719 --> 00:09:45.583
then you are going to have Allolactose,

00:09:45.583 --> 00:09:49.453
which is going to be able to
bind to the lac repressor,

00:09:49.453 --> 00:09:51.917
and by it binding to the lac repressor,

00:09:51.917 --> 00:09:53.333
the lac repressor is not going

00:09:53.333 --> 00:09:56.600
to be able to bind to the operator.

00:09:56.600 --> 00:09:58.669
And so you do have, once again,

00:09:58.669 --> 00:10:03.631
the RNA polymerase is going
to be able to transcribe.

00:10:03.631 --> 00:10:06.714
But because you have glucose present,

00:10:08.070 --> 00:10:10.346
you're going to have low or,

00:10:10.346 --> 00:10:12.805
well I'll just write low,

00:10:12.805 --> 00:10:13.722
Cyclic AMP.

00:10:15.680 --> 00:10:18.647
And since you have low
or no Cyclic AMP around,

00:10:18.647 --> 00:10:20.664
well, that Cyclic AMP
isn't going to be able

00:10:20.664 --> 00:10:24.166
to bind to the Catabolite
Activator Protein,

00:10:24.166 --> 00:10:28.198
and so the Catabolite
Activator Protein isn't going

00:10:28.198 --> 00:10:29.690
to be able to act as an activator.

00:10:29.690 --> 00:10:31.924
I know I'm using a lot
of words multiple times.

00:10:31.924 --> 00:10:35.893
And so it's not going to
bond to the activator site,

00:10:35.893 --> 00:10:38.211
or to the CAP site,

00:10:38.211 --> 00:10:41.500
and so you're going to
have less transcription.

00:10:41.500 --> 00:10:43.083
Less transcription,

00:10:46.717 --> 00:10:47.890
which once again makes sense.

00:10:47.890 --> 00:10:49.651
You've got glucose and lactose around.

00:10:49.651 --> 00:10:51.540
The cell would prefer to use glucose.

00:10:51.540 --> 00:10:52.501
Simpler sugar.

00:10:52.501 --> 00:10:53.923
Why waste resources?

00:10:53.923 --> 00:10:55.235
You have plenty of energy around,

00:10:55.235 --> 00:10:56.830
just go straight to the glucose.

00:10:56.830 --> 00:10:58.438
But if you don't have glucose around,

00:10:58.438 --> 00:11:00.410
well then use more resources

00:11:00.410 --> 00:11:03.327
so that you can digest the lactose.
