00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:13.460
From a director whose main qualification for Spider-Man is his last name

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:17.420
comes a Spider-Man 2 with the Spider-Man 3 level of quality

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:19.160
"(Whispering) Now dig on this"

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:21.160
"(crowd cheering)"

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.720
The Amazing Spider-Man 2.

00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:27.060
Hey didn't Cinemasins already do this one?

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:27.980
(ding)

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:32.020
You've already seen that premature reboot to the original trilogy.

00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:35.880
Now, before you see the solo spin off to the soft reboot crossover,

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.480
revisit the crappy sequel to the premature reboot

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:41.720
that failed so hard spidey swung back over to Marvel.

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:44.640
Then unfortunately back over to Sony again.

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:45.840
(sigh in disappointment)

00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:47.180
"Not a great plan."

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:49.080
Lower your expectations,

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:51.760
because the same guys who wrote Star Trek Into Darkness,

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:54.000
and a bunch of bad Michael Bay movies are back

00:00:54.060 --> 00:00:57.000
and you can bet they'll be ruining something you loved as a kid,

00:00:57.100 --> 00:00:59.160
while including magic blood at some point.

00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:02.880
"Once we caught him, I synthesize the serum from his super blood."

00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:05.640
"You need Spider-Man's blood?"

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:07.420
"It will save my life."

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:09.280
In a movie that's so bloated,

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:11.840
Black Cat and Spider Slayer only get cameos,

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:14.140
while Aunt May's nursing career has its own plot line.

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:15.460
"Double shift on Thursday."

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:20.440
"Who has to take nursing classes with 22 year old kids so I can pay for you to go to colleague."

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:22.240
Who asked for this!?

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:26.680
Return to a New York where everyone exclusively uses Sony products,

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:28.980
crowds cheer while violent crimes play out,

00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:31.560
"(crowd screaming and cheering in excitement)"

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:34.520
and everyone in the city is a scientific genius.

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:35.680
Except Aunt May.

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:39.400
"Me? Your stupid non-scientific aunt."

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:43.980
And say hello hello to Peter Parker, who's corrected his stutter from the first movie.

00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:45.880
"Um.. so you... wanna uh..."

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:46.880
"Wanna what?"

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:49.700
"I don't know we could... I don't we could uh..."

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:52.220
And replaced it with constantly repeating himself.

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:54.140
"I ask the question..."

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:56.160
"I ask the question."

00:01:56.160 --> 00:01:58.260
"Wait, wait, wait!" "Listen. No."

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:02.100
"Stay with me, stay with me, stay with me, you stay with me."

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:05.680
Watch his relationship with Gwen Stacy grow, from loving her so much,

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:08.640
they have to stay together against her dead dad's wishes.

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:10.740
"Don't make promises you can't keep, Mr. Parker."

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:12.640
"(Whispering) Yeah, but those are the best kind."

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:15.000
To loving her so much that they have to stay apart.

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:16.960
"I can't. I'm sorry Gwen."

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:20.040
To loving her so much that they had to stay together again...

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:22.360
with a healthy dose of stalking in between.

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:23.800
"Have you been following me?"

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:25.360
"Just once a day."

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:26.780
"Sometimes more."

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:30.220
"I'm following you now. I'm just gonna follow you everywhere."

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:33.720
Thrill as spider-Man faces off against Electro,

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:36.200
A villain who combines Milton from "Office Space",

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:38.160
with a Tumblr slash fiction blog.

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:40.160
"You like that spidey?"

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:41.380
"I like it a lot, Max."

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:43.240
When he falls into a tank of eels,

00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:45.960
he'll get a random grab bag of electric powers like Magneto. Like...

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:48.300
Magneto-ing. Force lightning.

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:49.920
Invisibility?

00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:52.200
And electric cosmetic dentistry?

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:54.960
But for some reason no actual eel powers.

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:58.380
I paid good money to watch Jamie Foxx built a nest for his eggs out of his own saliva.

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:00.620
That's an eel fact. Look it up.

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:04.280
Thrill as everyone forgets the lesson of "Spider-Man 3",

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:07.620
and crams even more villains into an already packed movie like

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:10.020
The Green Goblin. Again,

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:13.820
who's in a frantic rush to cure the diseases dad lived with for 60 years.

00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:15.600
"I do not have time!"

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:17.260
Stacy's Ghosts Dad.

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:18.480
And The Rhino.

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:21.540
"I am The Rhino!"

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:26.700
A ridiculous Russian transformer who begins in in fulfill my crab bread on a poop sandwich

00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:31.480
So settle in for a spider-Man movie with a good performance by Andrew Garfield,

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:33.480
that was so bogged down by subplots,

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:36.540
underwhelming action, trailer moments with no payoff,

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:40.180
and the constant stink of desperation to create a cinematic universe.

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:41.860
That writer Alex Kurtzman.

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:44.340
Did it all over again with "The Mummy (Reboot)"?!

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:46.840
Seriously?! How does that happen?!

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:06.740
Tom Holland is great but I'll miss Andrew Garfield.

00:04:06.860 --> 00:04:10.240
Maybe he could be cooling uncle Ben and get shot by Tobey Maguire?

00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:12.500
And then he can fly away in the Japanese Spider Zord.

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:14.480
(Imitating weapons and missiles firing noises)

00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:16.860
Now that's the Cinematic Universe I could get behind!

00:04:16.860 --> 00:04:19.020
