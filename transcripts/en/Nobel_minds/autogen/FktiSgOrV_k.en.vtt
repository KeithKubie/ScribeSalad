hello I'm Elliot's truck I'm 14 I'm

00:00:03.860 --> 00:00:03.870
hello I'm Elliot's truck I'm 14 I'm
 

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:06.740

taking physics petite CSE I'd like to

00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:06.750
taking physics petite CSE I'd like to
 

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:08.930
taking physics petite CSE I'd like to
ask you who is your physics inspiration

00:00:08.930 --> 00:00:08.940
ask you who is your physics inspiration
 

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:11.470
ask you who is your physics inspiration
and who inspired you to take physics on

00:00:11.470 --> 00:00:11.480
and who inspired you to take physics on
 

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:14.600
and who inspired you to take physics on
well it I think I got my inspiration to

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:14.610
well it I think I got my inspiration to
 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:17.359
well it I think I got my inspiration to
go into science from from Charles Darwin

00:00:17.359 --> 00:00:17.369
go into science from from Charles Darwin
 

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:20.660
go into science from from Charles Darwin
and Galileo Galilei they were working on

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:20.670
and Galileo Galilei they were working on
 

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:22.279
and Galileo Galilei they were working on
very hard problems they made tremendous

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:22.289
very hard problems they made tremendous
 

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:24.830
very hard problems they made tremendous
accomplishments and they made science

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:24.840
accomplishments and they made science
 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:27.200
accomplishments and they made science
look really exciting and very important

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:27.210
look really exciting and very important
 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:28.820
look really exciting and very important
they're so important that people didn't

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:28.830
they're so important that people didn't
 

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:32.389
they're so important that people didn't
like what they found out so I think that

00:00:32.389 --> 00:00:32.399
like what they found out so I think that
 

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:33.979
like what they found out so I think that
they were my first inspiration when I

00:00:33.979 --> 00:00:33.989
they were my first inspiration when I
 

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:36.740
they were my first inspiration when I
was quite young after that there were

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:36.750
was quite young after that there were
 

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:38.330
was quite young after that there were
many individual people my parents

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:38.340
many individual people my parents
 

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:41.290
many individual people my parents
certainly helped out with my scientific

00:00:41.290 --> 00:00:41.300
certainly helped out with my scientific
 

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:44.990
certainly helped out with my scientific
education by giving me opportunities but

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:45.000
education by giving me opportunities but
 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.540
education by giving me opportunities but
especially I would say when I got to

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:47.550
especially I would say when I got to
 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:49.430
especially I would say when I got to
graduate school and I met my thesis

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:49.440
graduate school and I met my thesis
 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:51.500
graduate school and I met my thesis
advisor who showed me really how to do

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:51.510
advisor who showed me really how to do
 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:54.260
advisor who showed me really how to do
physics as a research program that was

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:54.270
physics as a research program that was
 

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:56.029
physics as a research program that was
the main thing that made it possible for

00:00:56.029 --> 00:00:56.039
the main thing that made it possible for
 

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:58.819
the main thing that made it possible for
me to do what I'm doing today I credit

00:00:58.819 --> 00:00:58.829
me to do what I'm doing today I credit
 

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:02.090
me to do what I'm doing today I credit
many people thank you
