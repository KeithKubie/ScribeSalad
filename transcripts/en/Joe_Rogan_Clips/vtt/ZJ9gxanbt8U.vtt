00:00:01.990 --> 00:00:06.760
Here we go in five,
four,
three,
two,
one.

2
00:00:09.430 --> 00:00:14.160
Yes.
And all the fucking people that make me feel lazy in this world is to,

3
00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:18.400
okay.
It made me feel you and the rock you fuckers don't look like.

4
00:00:18.401 --> 00:00:20.860
Do you ever sleep?
And not enough.
No.
Days off.

5
00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:25.150
That's what I love is unattractive ass.
He's a,
he's a,

6
00:00:25.510 --> 00:00:26.890
he's a person that,

7
00:00:26.891 --> 00:00:31.090
that motivates me and inspires me in the fact that we're,

8
00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:35.890
we're coworkers.
We're friends.
Um,
I think is a,
I think it's like a,

9
00:00:35.891 --> 00:00:40.150
it's a blessing.
It's a blessing to be around that.
Yeah.
Because it truly,
it's,

10
00:00:40.151 --> 00:00:43.570
it's uplifting.
You know,
it makes you,
it just makes you weed out to circle.

11
00:00:43.571 --> 00:00:47.490
When you're around people that truly give you,
like,
uh,

12
00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:52.240
give you some good [inaudible] a good value to you in your life,

13
00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:57.070
you then look at those that don't,
and you can,
you can then push away.

14
00:00:57.071 --> 00:01:01.270
So I'm big on,
I'm big on personality.

15
00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:05.290
I'm big on energy.
I'm big on will.
And once,

16
00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:08.500
uh,
I believe that is contagious.
So if you have a,

17
00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:11.110
a bunch of laziness and a bunch of bullshit around you,

18
00:01:11.111 --> 00:01:12.250
naturally is going to feed off.

19
00:01:12.251 --> 00:01:15.070
You're gonna find yourself becoming what's in your environment.

20
00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:19.240
So I feel the exact same way.
And when I see it go,
can I see that in you?

21
00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:24.220
I see that in you.
I feel like it's a scene that avatar.
I see you.

22
00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:28.510
I see you.
Yeah.
But a guy like that,
I always wonder like,
how much of that is,

23
00:01:28.660 --> 00:01:31.390
look,
I've had sleep experts on the podcast and tell you like,

24
00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:34.770
like this real problems.
If you don't get enough sleep like you could,

25
00:01:34.771 --> 00:01:38.320
you have a much higher risk of Alzheimer's on this other serious issues.

26
00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:41.710
But I see a guy like the rock,
I'm like,
how the fuck does he sleep?
Well,

27
00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:45.520
where's the room for sleep?
You know that,
that's true.
I can't say that,
um,

28
00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:50.590
that I've witnessed the sleep patterns,
but he's,
he's a late ass,

29
00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:55.480
so he does,
I know he's sleeping at some point because like,

30
00:01:55.650 --> 00:01:58.600
you should play on where are we writing on these?
God Damn it,

31
00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:03.370
he's getting his rest,
which is well deserved.
Um,
but you know,
when you,

32
00:02:03.371 --> 00:02:05.500
when you say you had these sleep experts and stuff on,

33
00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:10.750
it's always a thing that I go back and forth about because what is enough sleep

34
00:02:10.751 --> 00:02:11.584
like I'm a person.

35
00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:16.240
I function high off of six to seven hours.

36
00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:20.950
Yeah.
Six seven hours.
I'm,
I'm functioning.
Yeah,
five hours.

37
00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:25.630
I'm great.
Do I do the five hour thing all the time?
No,
but if I have to,

38
00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:29.440
I'm fine.
Um,
I don't need the eight and a nine.

39
00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:32.740
I thought that's too much for me.
Like I'm,
I'm,

40
00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:36.370
I'm an early riser and now,
and I'm getting older,
you know,

41
00:02:36.371 --> 00:02:40.840
if I can get in that bed by nine 30 or 10 on a day off work day,

42
00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:44.770
I'm very happy with that.
But then I'm up at five 30 I'm up at five.

43
00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:47.000
So what is enough sleep?
What did they tell you is enough?

44
00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:48.520
So really depends on the person.

45
00:02:48.521 --> 00:02:52.040
There are people that have a gene where they can just sleep four hours at night.

46
00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:55.360
That's fine.
You might call it.
I got that.
Is that a,
does it,
what does that,

47
00:02:55.930 --> 00:02:58.720
does that mean motherhood is gold?
What does that,
what does it means?

48
00:02:58.721 --> 00:03:02.190
You've got gene [inaudible].
I got some shit,
but there are,

49
00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:04.780
there are people that just don't need as much.
They can,

50
00:03:04.781 --> 00:03:07.450
they can go a long time without sleep diagnosed me,

51
00:03:07.451 --> 00:03:09.250
I'm one of those people he brought you might be,

52
00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:11.020
I bet a lot of high functioning people are,

53
00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:15.000
cause your body tends to get more efficient.
You know,
like you're,

54
00:03:15.001 --> 00:03:18.310
you're always going,
you're always burning and hard so your body's like,

55
00:03:18.311 --> 00:03:22.270
when it's time to shut down,
it's like shut down.
Get that five,
six hours in.

56
00:03:22.271 --> 00:03:25.600
All right.
I will,
I will confess this.

57
00:03:25.601 --> 00:03:30.430
I am an amazing Catnapper.
Uh,
yeah,
I'm,

58
00:03:30.431 --> 00:03:35.140
I'm,
I'm one of those guys,
if you stop talking to me long enough,

59
00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:38.590
I'm a fault slip right here.

60
00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:42.790
I something about silence and just not doing anything and I just,

61
00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:46.270
well it's probably,
you're probably going on momentum all the time.
You probably,

62
00:03:46.271 --> 00:03:48.810
you're probably going on motivation and momentum.
Okay.

63
00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:51.180
Then when your body has his break,
you probably was like,

64
00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:55.310
we could use a little sleep right here.
It's 100% right.
I'm dead serious.
That's,

65
00:03:55.480 --> 00:03:59.350
I know for sure that that's accurate cause I'm catnapping heartbeat.

66
00:03:59.380 --> 00:04:01.750
Do you feel like you've hit a good balance?

67
00:04:01.751 --> 00:04:04.690
So this is why I was wondering about with guys like you or guys like the rock.

68
00:04:04.691 --> 00:04:06.460
When I look at your Instagram,
your social media,

69
00:04:06.461 --> 00:04:08.440
and you're just constantly going like,
God damn.
