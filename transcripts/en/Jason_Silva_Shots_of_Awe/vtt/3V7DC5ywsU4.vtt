[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:16.780 --> 00:00:19.590
There's a fascinating new
book by Diana Slattery called

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:23.990
Xenolinguistics-- Psychedelics
and the Evolution of Language,

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:25.940
which builds on
McKenna's notions

00:00:25.940 --> 00:00:28.483
that the world is
made of language.

00:00:28.483 --> 00:00:31.381
And if you know the words
the world is made of,

00:00:31.381 --> 00:00:33.510
you can make of it
whatever you wish,

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:37.435
kind of like Neo in The
Matrix when he sees the code.

00:00:37.435 --> 00:00:40.285
And so what does this mean,
this notion that reality

00:00:40.285 --> 00:00:41.720
is made of language?

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:44.080
Is it mere metaphor,
is it mere poetry?

00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:48.170
McKenna and Diana Slattery
say that actually the metaphor

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:49.571
is literalized,
when you actually

00:00:49.571 --> 00:00:50.570
look at the big picture.

00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:53.550
Even biology is
made of language.

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:55.240
Biology is code.

00:00:55.240 --> 00:00:56.930
DNA is code.

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:59.820
It's software that
writes its own hardware.

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:04.297
The words come before
the matter emerges.

00:01:04.297 --> 00:01:06.510
Just think about that,
because it resonates

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:08.010
in all kinds of
transcendental ways,

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:11.340
this notion that mind
came before matter.

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:13.610
That mind didn't emerge
from matter, but rather

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:15.600
that mind preceded matter.

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:17.723
It's a wild idea,
but it does seem

00:01:17.723 --> 00:01:20.500
to be that everything can be
described in terms of words,

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:22.480
whether it's music,
whether it's the atoms that

00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:24.590
describe the laws of physics.

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:26.420
It's all describeable.

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:28.450
It's all information.

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:30.340
It's a wild idea.

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:32.790
It's worth thinking about.
