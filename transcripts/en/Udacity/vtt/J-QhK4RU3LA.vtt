00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:04.550
Following the pattern we see up here, and should be the coefficient in front of

00:00:04.550 --> 00:00:11.134
log base 10 of 5. So we should have n log base 10 of 5. This property that

00:00:11.134 --> 00:00:14.851
we've been using is called the power property, and as we can see, it allows us

00:00:14.851 --> 00:00:19.109
to write the log without the exponent of the input.
