00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:03.020
&gt;&gt; My name is Russ Altman, I am on the faculty

00:00:03.020 --> 00:00:04.680
at Stanford in a number of

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:08.112
departments, including Bio-engineering and Genetics. they

00:00:08.112 --> 00:00:10.650
pay me, and then I have an appointment in medicine and in

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:14.530
computer science and I live nearby at Stanford, from New York originally.

00:00:14.530 --> 00:00:16.139
&gt;&gt; That's great. And you are one of

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:20.030
the creators, the creator, I guess of Pharmgkb.

00:00:20.030 --> 00:00:20.960
&gt;&gt; It's a team.

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:21.617
&gt;&gt; It's a team.

00:00:21.617 --> 00:00:23.380
&gt;&gt; I wrote the original proposal and have continued

00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:25.348
to be the principal investigator. It's now in its

00:00:25.348 --> 00:00:27.450
13th year. We started back in 2000.

00:00:27.450 --> 00:00:29.845
&gt;&gt; Great, and so for somebody who's just seen

00:00:29.845 --> 00:00:33.620
Pharmgkb for the first time, what is it all about?

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:38.620
&gt;&gt; So, we are totally excited about the how genetics can influence

00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:42.560
your drug response. And, back in 2000 the NIH and others realized

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:45.800
there needed to be a centralized repository to gather all that information

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:51.080
together. So, the mission of Pharmgkb, simply put, is to understand all

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:55.470
human genetic variation that, that impacts drug response and to

00:00:55.470 --> 00:00:59.560
catalog it to make it available to researchers, and eventually practitioners.

00:00:59.560 --> 00:01:01.740
So that they can use it in their work. And it's

00:01:01.740 --> 00:01:04.870
a one stop shop for the genetic influences on drug response.

00:01:04.870 --> 00:01:07.320
&gt;&gt; That sounds like a mountain of information.

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:11.230
&gt;&gt; We have, we do, we do this in two ways. We have human curators

00:01:11.230 --> 00:01:13.830
who are experts in pharmacogenomics. And they read

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:16.340
the literature literally every week as the journals

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:19.570
come out. They scan them looking for genes and drugs. And

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:22.610
their relationships being discussed. And then put them on a queue

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:26.580
for human curation. This has become difficult, and so the second

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:29.350
effort in the lab are software tools to do this. So

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:32.900
we do a lot of natural language processing, data mining and

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:36.330
stuff like that, to try to help put good articles in

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:39.030
front of the curators so that they can be more efficient.

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:41.400
We do still want humans in the loop, because this is

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:45.090
sufficiently tricky and the end goal being it might

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:47.660
actually affect patients. So we're not ready to close

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:50.030
the loop and just have computers doing it all.

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:51.620
So there's always a human in the loop so far.

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:54.480
&gt;&gt; Well, who's the intended audience for this? Is this sort

00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:58.170
of opened up mainly to clinicians or science people or anyone?

00:01:58.170 --> 00:01:59.040
&gt;&gt; It's a great question, and that

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:01.890
has evolved. For the first five, seven years

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:04.060
of the database. It was specifically just

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:06.530
for pharmacogenetic researchers. To let them know what

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:08.770
was known and what was not known. Really, so

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:10.520
that it could pick the problems to work on.

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:13.110
And not reinvent a wheel, or be unaware of

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:16.930
some important discoveries that have been made. With the success

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:20.880
of the field, however, it has become, increasingly apparent

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:23.030
that some of this stuff is ready to roll out

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:26.720
in clinical practice. And so, we are now, involved

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:31.760
in consortia. Where we're actually writing clinical practice guidelines for,

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:34.530
clinicians, to actually use pharmacogenomics in

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:36.450
practice. And, and that's probably where

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:38.960
we'll stop. We'll probably go all the way from the raw data.

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:39.480
&gt;&gt; Mm hm.

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:42.960
&gt;&gt; all the way up to the clinical advice that you

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:46.920
would give to a physician who's making a decision about drug prescribing.

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:47.090
&gt;&gt; Wow.

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:49.632
&gt;&gt; And that's really exciting because that's how

00:02:49.632 --> 00:02:52.090
you actually impact patients. And that's why we do

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:54.140
this. We do this because we all believed that

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:56.990
the genome was going to be important for health.

00:02:56.990 --> 00:03:00.090
And your response to drugs turns out to be one of the key,

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:04.130
early uses of the genome that we'll be able to benefit patients with.

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:06.640
&gt;&gt; So if you were an individual, just a layperson,

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:11.550
who had personal genetic information about, let's say, a gene that

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:14.400
affects the metabolism of a certain drug, you could take

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:19.010
your variation and go Pharmgkb, and what would you find out?

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:22.250
&gt;&gt; So, at Pharmgkb you would find a couple of things.

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:24.760
You would find the entire literature on that drug

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:27.822
gene pair. indexed as to how good was the study,

00:03:27.822 --> 00:03:30.480
not how good was the study, but how big

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:33.880
was the study? How compelling were the statistics when they

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:36.420
did the analysis? And you'll find all the individual

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:39.900
papers, but what you'll also find is products that our

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:42.718
team has created to kind of integrate that data. So

00:03:42.718 --> 00:03:45.380
these clinical guidelines are one thing that you may find.

00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:45.750
&gt;&gt;

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:47.440
&gt;&gt; these require a lot of evidence,

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:50.720
so there is not as many of them as there are things for weaker

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:52.290
evidence. There's about 12 of them. Where

00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:54.220
we can really put down clinical advice,

00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:54.730
&gt;&gt; Mm-hmm.

00:03:54.730 --> 00:03:58.710
&gt;&gt; But our, our curators also put together pathways of drug response to show

00:03:58.710 --> 00:04:00.740
what's happening in the liver or what's

00:04:00.740 --> 00:04:03.250
happening in the effector cells. That are

00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:05.880
affected by all of these genetic variations,

00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:07.910
they also write summaries. This gene is

00:04:07.910 --> 00:04:10.860
important because and they actually publish these

00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:12.460
summaries so that somebody who wants to learn

00:04:12.460 --> 00:04:14.430
about a particularly important gene.

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:14.710
&gt;&gt; Mm-hmm.

00:04:14.710 --> 00:04:17.670
&gt;&gt; So a, a patient unless they have

00:04:17.670 --> 00:04:20.820
scientific background would not find too much. A

00:04:20.820 --> 00:04:23.640
physician would find those clinical guidelines and the

00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:27.061
supporting evidence. And a researcher would find, well,

00:04:27.061 --> 00:04:31.818
a candy land of the raw, the raw published literature and then what we hope are

00:04:31.818 --> 00:04:34.161
very useful summaries of it to help them

00:04:34.161 --> 00:04:37.570
think about what the next research questions should be.

00:04:37.570 --> 00:04:39.610
&gt;&gt; Yeah. It sounds like, a great, amalgamation of

00:04:39.610 --> 00:04:41.900
the information that exists, but in a centralized place.

00:04:41.900 --> 00:04:43.350
&gt;&gt; We call it a knowledge pyramid. We, in

00:04:43.350 --> 00:04:46.320
fact, if you look at the site, Pharmgkb.org. Please visit

00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:50.430
it. pharmgkb.org has this knowledge pyramid where we have

00:04:50.430 --> 00:04:53.120
the raw data that's published in the literature. And then

00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:55.310
we have aggregations of it. And then we have

00:04:55.310 --> 00:04:57.470
filtering of it, and then we have the clinical advice

00:04:57.470 --> 00:04:59.140
that we give to doctors. And that's really how it

00:04:59.140 --> 00:05:02.990
works, you have all this research that eventually Impacts patients.

00:05:02.990 --> 00:05:04.990
&gt;&gt; Do you keep of how many entries

00:05:04.990 --> 00:05:08.060
you have? Like, how many drug, genetic variation responses?

00:05:08.060 --> 00:05:10.360
&gt;&gt; Absolutely. So I do annual reports for the NIH.

00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:10.800
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:12.830
&gt;&gt; And so over the le-, years, we have totally

00:05:12.830 --> 00:05:16.140
instrumented the site. We know how many hits every page gets.

00:05:16.140 --> 00:05:16.390
&gt;&gt; Wow.

00:05:16.390 --> 00:05:18.760
&gt;&gt; We know the most popular pathways

00:05:18.760 --> 00:05:20.610
that people look at. The most popular genes.

00:05:20.610 --> 00:05:21.250
&gt;&gt; Name one.

00:05:21.250 --> 00:05:24.173
&gt;&gt; so people love codeine. And people

00:05:24.173 --> 00:05:25.096
[CROSSTALK]

00:05:25.096 --> 00:05:26.300
&gt;&gt; Don't they, don't they though.

00:05:26.300 --> 00:05:28.340
&gt;&gt; Exactly, it's a pain reliever. People

00:05:28.340 --> 00:05:31.150
are very interested in Warfarin. For the

00:05:31.150 --> 00:05:34.700
pathways, those are the ones they like, for the genes, they like some of

00:05:34.700 --> 00:05:35.840
the genes that are involved, there's a

00:05:35.840 --> 00:05:41.780
gene called cyp2d6, terrible name, cytochrome p4502d6,

00:05:41.780 --> 00:05:45.120
which is very important for hundreds of drugs. And that's one of our top hits.

00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:47.850
&gt;&gt; What other resources would you recommend? I mean,

00:05:47.850 --> 00:05:50.140
is, is, do you want Pharmgkb to sort of be

00:05:50.140 --> 00:05:52.670
the one stop shop or are there other useful resources that

00:05:52.670 --> 00:05:54.880
you would recommend to people sort of in conjunction with this?

00:05:54.880 --> 00:05:58.290
&gt;&gt; Absolutely. So couple things. we have

00:05:58.290 --> 00:06:02.290
this tab based display format right now. One

00:06:02.290 --> 00:06:05.870
of the tabs is Other Resources. And it's very important because what we can do

00:06:05.870 --> 00:06:09.560
is since we know the drug or the gene that the user is currently looking

00:06:09.560 --> 00:06:12.730
at. We can have super specific links to

00:06:12.730 --> 00:06:15.310
other information sources about those drugs, about those

00:06:15.310 --> 00:06:18.410
genes, about the diseases that they treat. And so

00:06:18.410 --> 00:06:21.420
we have those links and we are always looking for

00:06:21.420 --> 00:06:23.580
more links. because this is the beauty of the

00:06:23.580 --> 00:06:26.310
world wide web, is you can make these connections. In

00:06:26.310 --> 00:06:28.710
addition to that, sometimes a data source is so

00:06:28.710 --> 00:06:31.120
valuable that we, with the permission of the people who

00:06:31.120 --> 00:06:34.220
are creating it, bring it into the Pharmgkb so

00:06:34.220 --> 00:06:36.840
we can more tightly integrate that data with our data

00:06:36.840 --> 00:06:37.231
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.

00:06:37.231 --> 00:06:38.400
&gt;&gt; So there's kind of two phases

00:06:38.400 --> 00:06:40.370
of the relationship, the, we'll definitely link to

00:06:40.370 --> 00:06:42.900
you phase, and then the, we love you so

00:06:42.900 --> 00:06:44.310
much that if it's okay with you, we'd like

00:06:44.310 --> 00:06:45.930
to bring you in and make you part of

00:06:45.930 --> 00:06:49.010
our interface, part of the way we represent information.

00:06:49.010 --> 00:06:53.460
And these include Basic biological databases like GenBank, which holds DNA

00:06:53.460 --> 00:06:57.430
sequence. There's a very valuable drug resource called Drug Bank, which we link

00:06:57.430 --> 00:07:05.470
to. There are the DB Gap, which holds G-WOSS studies, and a

00:07:05.470 --> 00:07:07.870
long list of other links that you would find on this site.
