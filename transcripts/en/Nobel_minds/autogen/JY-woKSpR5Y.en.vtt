hi David gross my questions for you are

00:00:04.900 --> 00:00:04.910
hi David gross my questions for you are
 

00:00:04.910 --> 00:00:07.599
hi David gross my questions for you are
is the notion of time a necessary

00:00:07.599 --> 00:00:07.609
is the notion of time a necessary
 

00:00:07.609 --> 00:00:09.879
is the notion of time a necessary
component of string theory and do you

00:00:09.879 --> 00:00:09.889
component of string theory and do you
 

00:00:09.889 --> 00:00:11.799
component of string theory and do you
think it is even possible for the human

00:00:11.799 --> 00:00:11.809
think it is even possible for the human
 

00:00:11.809 --> 00:00:13.419
think it is even possible for the human
brain to ever really understand the

00:00:13.419 --> 00:00:13.429
brain to ever really understand the
 

00:00:13.429 --> 00:00:15.450
brain to ever really understand the
universe

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:15.460
universe

hi Meredith so you asked is the notion

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:19.240
hi Meredith so you asked is the notion
 

00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:22.019
hi Meredith so you asked is the notion
of time a necessary component of string

00:00:22.019 --> 00:00:22.029
of time a necessary component of string
 

00:00:22.029 --> 00:00:25.160
of time a necessary component of string
theory and the answer is so far

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:25.170
theory and the answer is so far
 

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:30.870
theory and the answer is so far
absolutely in fact it's a bit

00:00:30.870 --> 00:00:30.880
absolutely in fact it's a bit
 

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:33.660
absolutely in fact it's a bit
frustrating that it is hard to give up

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:33.670
frustrating that it is hard to give up
 

00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:35.700
frustrating that it is hard to give up
the notion of time in string theory we

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:35.710
the notion of time in string theory we
 

00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:38.280
the notion of time in string theory we
have examples now which are really

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:38.290
have examples now which are really
 

00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:43.520
have examples now which are really
intriguing in which space some

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:43.530
intriguing in which space some
 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:46.650

approaches to constructing solutions of

00:00:46.650 --> 00:00:46.660
approaches to constructing solutions of
 

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:52.080
approaches to constructing solutions of
string theory give are better described

00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:52.090
string theory give are better described
 

00:00:52.090 --> 00:00:55.439
string theory give are better described
in terms of a framework in which there

00:00:55.439 --> 00:00:55.449
in terms of a framework in which there
 

00:00:55.449 --> 00:01:00.180
in terms of a framework in which there
are fewer or no spatial dimensions so

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:00.190
are fewer or no spatial dimensions so
 

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:04.760
are fewer or no spatial dimensions so
there's spaces and emergent property of

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:04.770
there's spaces and emergent property of
 

00:01:04.770 --> 00:01:08.640
there's spaces and emergent property of
physics at large distances and that's a

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:08.650
physics at large distances and that's a
 

00:01:08.650 --> 00:01:10.830
physics at large distances and that's a
very exciting concept that the notions

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:10.840
very exciting concept that the notions
 

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:14.280
very exciting concept that the notions
of space that space is not a fundamental

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:14.290
of space that space is not a fundamental
 

00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:17.490
of space that space is not a fundamental
component of our description of nature

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:17.500
component of our description of nature
 

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:20.429
component of our description of nature
but rather an emergent concept it might

00:01:20.429 --> 00:01:20.439
but rather an emergent concept it might
 

00:01:20.439 --> 00:01:23.179
but rather an emergent concept it might
even solve certain problems that we face

00:01:23.179 --> 00:01:23.189
even solve certain problems that we face
 

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:28.440
even solve certain problems that we face
but it has not been possible so far to

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:28.450
but it has not been possible so far to
 

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:31.709
but it has not been possible so far to
do that with time time is very special

00:01:31.709 --> 00:01:31.719
do that with time time is very special
 

00:01:31.719 --> 00:01:34.139
do that with time time is very special
very different than space physics is

00:01:34.139 --> 00:01:34.149
very different than space physics is
 

00:01:34.149 --> 00:01:38.010
very different than space physics is
about time you know in a sense physics

00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:38.020
about time you know in a sense physics
 

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:39.959
about time you know in a sense physics
the job of physics is to predict the

00:01:39.959 --> 00:01:39.969
the job of physics is to predict the
 

00:01:39.969 --> 00:01:42.630
the job of physics is to predict the
future given the present so it would be

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:42.640
future given the present so it would be
 

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:45.450
future given the present so it would be
hard to do way without time to do away

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:45.460
hard to do way without time to do away
 

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:47.789
hard to do way without time to do away
with time and to have a description

00:01:47.789 --> 00:01:47.799
with time and to have a description
 

00:01:47.799 --> 00:01:51.749
with time and to have a description
without conventional time because we

00:01:51.749 --> 00:01:51.759
without conventional time because we
 

00:01:51.759 --> 00:01:53.100
without conventional time because we
wouldn't know what the purpose of

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:53.110
wouldn't know what the purpose of
 

00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:55.679
wouldn't know what the purpose of
physics was there was no time what would

00:01:55.679 --> 00:01:55.689
physics was there was no time what would
 

00:01:55.689 --> 00:01:57.569
physics was there was no time what would
it mean to predict the future given the

00:01:57.569 --> 00:01:57.579
it mean to predict the future given the
 

00:01:57.579 --> 00:02:02.039
it mean to predict the future given the
present and yet I tend to suspect that

00:02:02.039 --> 00:02:02.049
present and yet I tend to suspect that
 

00:02:02.049 --> 00:02:05.550
present and yet I tend to suspect that
our notions of time will eventually be

00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:05.560
our notions of time will eventually be
 

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:07.540
our notions of time will eventually be
modified as we learn more and more

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:07.550
modified as we learn more and more
 

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:09.990
modified as we learn more and more
about what string theory really is and

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:10.000
about what string theory really is and
 

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:14.310
about what string theory really is and
believe me we don't truly know yet and

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:14.320
believe me we don't truly know yet and
 

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:18.010
believe me we don't truly know yet and
but how it will I will be able to do

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:18.020
but how it will I will be able to do
 

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:20.950
but how it will I will be able to do
without over to regard time itself as an

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:20.960
without over to regard time itself as an
 

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:24.340
without over to regard time itself as an
emerging concept is beyond me at the

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:24.350
emerging concept is beyond me at the
 

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:27.340
emerging concept is beyond me at the
moment you had a second question is it

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:27.350
moment you had a second question is it
 

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:29.800
moment you had a second question is it
even possible for the human brain to

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:29.810
even possible for the human brain to
 

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:33.970
even possible for the human brain to
comprehend the universe it could be that

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:33.980
comprehend the universe it could be that
 

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:38.110
comprehend the universe it could be that
our brain is limited you know I have two

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:38.120
our brain is limited you know I have two
 

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:40.060
our brain is limited you know I have two
dogs and I've tried to teach them

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:40.070
dogs and I've tried to teach them
 

00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:42.490
dogs and I've tried to teach them
quantum mechanics and they just don't

00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:42.500
quantum mechanics and they just don't
 

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:45.370
quantum mechanics and they just don't
get it no matter how hard I try they're

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:45.380
get it no matter how hard I try they're
 

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:47.560
get it no matter how hard I try they're
unable to understand quantum mechanics

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:47.570
unable to understand quantum mechanics
 

00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:50.290
unable to understand quantum mechanics
and so we we understand that some

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:50.300
and so we we understand that some
 

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:54.880
and so we we understand that some
species are it's beyond their capacity

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:54.890
species are it's beyond their capacity
 

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:57.640
species are it's beyond their capacity
to comprehend certain things that we

00:02:57.640 --> 00:02:57.650
to comprehend certain things that we
 

00:02:57.650 --> 00:02:59.650
to comprehend certain things that we
understand and it might be beyond our

00:02:59.650 --> 00:02:59.660
understand and it might be beyond our
 

00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:03.190
understand and it might be beyond our
capacity to understand the principles

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:03.200
capacity to understand the principles
 

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:08.710
capacity to understand the principles
that governed the universe I'm not sure

00:03:08.710 --> 00:03:08.720
that governed the universe I'm not sure
 

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:10.510
that governed the universe I'm not sure
that that's the case because there are

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:10.520
that that's the case because there are
 

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:13.600
that that's the case because there are
certain tools that we possess like

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:13.610
certain tools that we possess like
 

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:17.560
certain tools that we possess like
language and an advanced form of

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:17.570
language and an advanced form of
 

00:03:17.570 --> 00:03:20.170
language and an advanced form of
language which is mathematics that

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:20.180
language which is mathematics that
 

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:23.050
language which is mathematics that
seemed to have infinite capability they

00:03:23.050 --> 00:03:23.060
seemed to have infinite capability they
 

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:25.000
seemed to have infinite capability they
then they might not be enough to

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:25.010
then they might not be enough to
 

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:26.770
then they might not be enough to
understand the universe but they do have

00:03:26.770 --> 00:03:26.780
understand the universe but they do have
 

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:30.970
understand the universe but they do have
a lot perhaps infinite capability we can

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:30.980
a lot perhaps infinite capability we can
 

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:34.570
a lot perhaps infinite capability we can
you can in fact compose sentences and

00:03:34.570 --> 00:03:34.580
you can in fact compose sentences and
 

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:36.220
you can in fact compose sentences and
utter them that have never been uttered

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:36.230
utter them that have never been uttered
 

00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:39.300
utter them that have never been uttered
before so language itself already has a

00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:39.310
before so language itself already has a
 

00:03:39.310 --> 00:03:42.010
before so language itself already has a
kind of infinite capability and

00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:42.020
kind of infinite capability and
 

00:03:42.020 --> 00:03:46.590
kind of infinite capability and
mathematics appears to build on that so

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:46.600
mathematics appears to build on that so
 

00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:50.979
mathematics appears to build on that so
we might be able to we don't know and

00:03:50.979 --> 00:03:50.989
we might be able to we don't know and
 

00:03:50.989 --> 00:03:52.600
we might be able to we don't know and
the only way we're going to find out is

00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:52.610
the only way we're going to find out is
 

00:03:52.610 --> 00:03:55.990
the only way we're going to find out is
to try if we sense at some point that

00:03:55.990 --> 00:03:56.000
to try if we sense at some point that
 

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:57.640
to try if we sense at some point that
the questions are getting too hard for

00:03:57.640 --> 00:03:57.650
the questions are getting too hard for
 

00:03:57.650 --> 00:04:00.340
the questions are getting too hard for
us to answer and that people young

00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:00.350
us to answer and that people young

people entering a field are faced with
 

00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:06.330
people entering a field are faced with
difficulties that they cannot surmount

difficulties that they cannot surmount
 

00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:10.150
difficulties that they cannot surmount
then we might begin to wonder whether we

00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:10.160
then we might begin to wonder whether we
 

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:13.839
then we might begin to wonder whether we
like dogs have a limit or capabilities

00:04:13.839 --> 00:04:13.849
like dogs have a limit or capabilities
 

00:04:13.849 --> 00:04:16.330
like dogs have a limit or capabilities
and will not be able to understand the

00:04:16.330 --> 00:04:16.340
and will not be able to understand the
 

00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:20.650
and will not be able to understand the
universe there's no evidence of that

00:04:20.650 --> 00:04:20.660
universe there's no evidence of that
 

00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:23.350
universe there's no evidence of that
happening yet if it does happen we

00:04:23.350 --> 00:04:23.360
happening yet if it does happen we
 

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:25.450
happening yet if it does happen we
always have another out we can start

00:04:25.450 --> 00:04:25.460
always have another out we can start
 

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:28.810
always have another out we can start
modifying ourselves and we're gonna

00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:28.820
modifying ourselves and we're gonna
 

00:04:28.820 --> 00:04:31.300
modifying ourselves and we're gonna
probably do so anyway in order to

00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:31.310
probably do so anyway in order to
 

00:04:31.310 --> 00:04:33.339
probably do so anyway in order to
improve our capabilities so I'm

00:04:33.339 --> 00:04:33.349
improve our capabilities so I'm
 

00:04:33.349 --> 00:04:35.530
improve our capabilities so I'm
optimistic
