00:00:00.070 --> 00:00:04.400
Coral reefs are like the rainforests of the
sea, and like those here on land, they're

00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:05.620
being destroyed.

00:00:05.620 --> 00:00:13.000
But why should you care?

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.750
Howdy friends under the sea, Trace here for
DNews.

00:00:16.750 --> 00:00:20.590
When you picture coral you probably see it
like THIS[a] right?

00:00:20.590 --> 00:00:23.080
But coral aren't just colorful rocks.

00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:25.390
Tiny living things live in there.

00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:29.779
Those "rocks" are actually the skeletons of
polyps, which look like this[b].

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:34.039
Polyps constantly secrete calcium carbonate
to build these protective skeletons.

00:00:34.039 --> 00:00:38.640
This is why people say coral reefs are living,
not because the calcium structures are alive,

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:43.820
but because the polyps live inside those structures
-- like a turtle in a shell -- only popping

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:46.899
out to feed or occasionally fight with one
another.

00:00:46.899 --> 00:00:52.379
Coral are related to jellyfish, and sea anemones
and are not mobile animals, instead they anchor

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:54.980
and live their whole lives in one place.

00:00:54.980 --> 00:00:59.230
Polyps can be as small as the head of a pin
or as large as a foot across (30 cm) and while

00:00:59.230 --> 00:01:02.050
some grow in groups, others are solitary.

00:01:02.050 --> 00:01:07.400
The varied colors in their bodies comes from
symbiotic algae that live inside of them.

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:12.811
As they grow and die, more coral grow on top
of them, and over millions of years, coral

00:01:12.811 --> 00:01:20.050
pile together to form giant coral reefs that
create the basis for 25 percent of ALL ocean

00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:25.491
life, even though they're only point-one percent
of the area of the ocean -- again, rainforest

00:01:25.491 --> 00:01:26.979
of the sea.

00:01:26.979 --> 00:01:31.030
Coral appeared in the fossil record 400 million
years ago.

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:35.259
As the polyps grow through their life cycle,
the calcium carbonate they secrete will sometimes

00:01:35.259 --> 00:01:37.850
merge with the secretions of other polyps
around them, forming shapes.

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:45.420
The polyps can form tables, pillars, spiral
wires, staghorns, and brain coral.

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:50.360
They're all rigid structures with living polyps,
but they live in different places and require

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:51.450
different conditions.

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:56.990
These shapes are affected by weather, currents
and of course human and large animal activity.

00:01:56.990 --> 00:02:01.310
When coral like this band together, they're
called "reef building coral," and they form

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:03.630
some of the most diverse ecosystems on our
planet.

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:07.479
If you're like me, you grew up hearing the
reefs were important, but I was never sure

00:02:07.479 --> 00:02:08.479
WHY.

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:10.340
After researching, I get it.

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:13.739
I could list all the animals living in a coral
reef, but to be honest, this DNews episode

00:02:13.739 --> 00:02:14.750
would never end.

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:19.450
There are literally millions of species that
subsist in, on and around coral reefs.

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:24.300
They've been around for millions of years,
so it's safe to say there are likely fish,

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:30.280
crustaceans and algae that evolved to live
on reefs and nowhere else, just like insects,

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:32.300
mammals and birds in the Amazon.

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:33.370
It's mind-boggling.

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:34.500
Thats not all they do.

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:37.220
Coral also control how much carbon dioxide
is in the ocean.

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:41.420
They take the carbon dioxide out of the water,
and use it to build their calcium carbonate

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:42.420
skeletons.

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:46.650
Without coral, the amount of CO2 in the water
would affect the whole planet, but luckily,

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:48.730
they trap that in stone for us all.

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:52.560
And if housing species, looking awesome, and
saving the planet wasn't enough...

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:55.860
Coral reefs alter how the ocean affects the
shore.

00:02:55.860 --> 00:03:00.180
Because they build up over millions of years,
and can survive live in warm shallow water

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:06.150
as well as colder deeper water, reefs can
span massive areas and undulate like mountain

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:07.150
ranges.

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:10.660
They build themselves to withstand typhoons,
hurricanes and other tropical storms, and

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:14.840
therefore buffer the shore against waves,
storms, and floods!

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:18.720
These tiny animals evolved long before we
did, and their existence in areas like Australia

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:24.360
and Florida can prevent loss of life, property
damage, and erosion by tempering the rushing

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:25.360
ocean.

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:26.370
Today, coral are in trouble.

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:32.060
Because coral are so sensitive to water temperature,
global warming/climate change, ocean acidification,

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:36.220
ecotourism and commercial overfishing are
beginning to kill off these tiny animals.

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:40.590
In fact, when the animal is stressed, they
release their symbiotic colorful algae into

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:43.120
the water, turn white and die.

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:48.540
Which is why it's important to think of coral
not as pretty rocks but as living things like

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:49.720
a dog or an elephant.

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:55.230
A new 42 year study of coral has found we've
only got about a sixth of the coral left on

00:03:55.230 --> 00:04:00.040
our planet -- with the Caribbean losing 50-percent
of their coral since 1970.

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:05.270
But all hope is not lost, the parrotfish might
be a coral savior.

00:04:05.270 --> 00:04:09.730
Where parrotfish live, coral are thriving,
so new sanctions on the protection of parrotfish

00:04:09.730 --> 00:04:10.750
are being considered.

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:15.950
With a bit of effort we can help these little
animals continue another 400 million years,

00:04:15.950 --> 00:04:18.370
and it helps to get to know them a bit better,
right?

00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:21.630
Do you know more about coral now?

00:04:21.630 --> 00:04:24.340
