00:00:00.421 --> 00:00:03.327
- Drag the lines up or down.

00:00:03.327 --> 00:00:05.927
Order them from longest to shortest.

00:00:05.927 --> 00:00:08.589
Put the longest line on top.

00:00:08.589 --> 00:00:10.295
So, alright, out of these three lines,

00:00:10.295 --> 00:00:11.433
the longest one is this one.

00:00:11.433 --> 00:00:12.896
So, I click on this

00:00:12.896 --> 00:00:15.801
and I move it to the top.

00:00:15.801 --> 00:00:17.041
And they want us to order

00:00:17.041 --> 00:00:19.032
from longest to shortest.

00:00:19.032 --> 00:00:20.738
So, we want the longest on top,

00:00:20.738 --> 00:00:22.811
and the shortest on the bottom

00:00:22.811 --> 00:00:24.253
and the medium one in the middle.

00:00:24.253 --> 00:00:25.107
And, that's what we have.

00:00:25.107 --> 00:00:27.626
Longest, less long and the least long,

00:00:27.626 --> 00:00:29.521
or the shortest, right over there.

00:00:30.381 --> 00:00:31.344
Let's keep going.

00:00:32.314 --> 00:00:33.477
Alright.

00:00:33.477 --> 00:00:36.423
Is it taller or shorter?

00:00:36.423 --> 00:00:38.170
So, let's see this whale,

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:39.694
even if we don't count the water

00:00:39.694 --> 00:00:41.320
that's coming out of its spout,

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:44.448
is taller than these three blocks.

00:00:44.448 --> 00:00:45.220
So, I would say,

00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:49.873
the whale is taller than three blocks.

00:00:49.873 --> 00:00:53.063
If I said the whale is
shorter than three blocks

00:00:53.063 --> 00:00:54.261
it wouldn't make sense.

00:00:54.261 --> 00:00:57.817
'Cause a whale is more
than three blocks tall.

00:00:57.817 --> 00:01:00.418
So, it's taller than the three blocks.

00:01:00.418 --> 00:01:02.043
The squirrel is, well,

00:01:02.043 --> 00:01:04.522
the squirrel is clearly shorter

00:01:04.522 --> 00:01:05.476
than the three blocks.

00:01:05.476 --> 00:01:07.833
It looks like it's about two blocks tall.

00:01:07.833 --> 00:01:11.998
So, the squirrel is shorter
than the two blocks.

00:01:11.998 --> 00:01:14.233
You scroll down because
there's another question.

00:01:14.233 --> 00:01:17.728
So, the whale is blank the squirrel.

00:01:17.728 --> 00:01:18.926
Well, the whale's gonna be taller

00:01:18.926 --> 00:01:20.186
than the squirrel,

00:01:20.186 --> 00:01:22.705
and you can see that if
you just compare the whale

00:01:22.705 --> 00:01:23.721
straight to the squirrel,

00:01:23.721 --> 00:01:25.062
or you can say, "look,
if the whale is more

00:01:25.062 --> 00:01:26.484
"than three blocks,

00:01:26.484 --> 00:01:28.557
"the whale is taller than three blocks,

00:01:28.557 --> 00:01:30.893
"the squirrel is shorter
than three blocks,

00:01:30.893 --> 00:01:33.697
"so the whale must be
taller than the squirrel."

00:01:33.697 --> 00:01:35.464
Because the whale is
taller than the blocks

00:01:35.464 --> 00:01:37.029
which are taller than the squirrel.

00:01:37.029 --> 00:01:40.097
So, the whale is gonna be
taller than the squirrel.

00:01:40.097 --> 00:01:41.702
Let's keep going.

00:01:41.702 --> 00:01:43.693
Is it taller or shorter?

00:01:43.693 --> 00:01:47.655
The cookie is shorter
than these five blocks.

00:01:47.655 --> 00:01:49.849
The ice cream cone is, well it looks,

00:01:49.849 --> 00:01:52.002
it's taller than the five blocks.

00:01:52.002 --> 00:01:54.501
So, the cookie is, well,

00:01:54.501 --> 00:01:56.310
the cookie's shorter than the five blocks

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:58.097
which is shorter than the ice cream cone.

00:01:58.097 --> 00:02:00.089
The ice cream cone is
taller than the blocks

00:02:00.089 --> 00:02:01.998
which are taller than the cookie.

00:02:01.998 --> 00:02:03.217
So, the cookie is, for sure,

00:02:03.217 --> 00:02:05.188
shorter than the ice cream cone.

00:02:05.188 --> 00:02:06.204
It's shorter than this

00:02:06.204 --> 00:02:07.707
which is shorter than the ice cream cone.

00:02:07.707 --> 00:02:10.390
So, it's definitely shorter
than the ice cream cone.

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:12.116
Let's do one more.

00:02:12.116 --> 00:02:13.335
Is it taller or shorter?

00:02:13.335 --> 00:02:16.200
Well, the penguin is taller
than the four blocks.

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:18.699
The turtle is shorter than the 10 blocks,

00:02:18.699 --> 00:02:20.487
sorry, the four blocks.

00:02:20.487 --> 00:02:22.417
The penguin is taller than four blocks.

00:02:22.417 --> 00:02:24.244
The turtle is shorter than four blocks.

00:02:24.244 --> 00:02:26.277
So, the penguin is, well,

00:02:26.277 --> 00:02:27.801
it's gonna be taller than a turtle.

00:02:27.801 --> 00:02:29.243
The penguin is taller than the blocks

00:02:29.243 --> 00:02:30.808
which are taller than the turtle.

00:02:30.808 --> 00:02:34.201
So, the penguin is taller than the turtle.

00:02:34.201 --> 00:02:35.324
Lots of fun.
