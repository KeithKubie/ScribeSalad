00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:03.470
PROFESSOR: Welcome to the
applet Amplitude and Phase:

00:00:03.470 --> 00:00:06.270
Second Order II.

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:09.810
This applet is a sibling of
the applet Amplitude and Phase:

00:00:09.810 --> 00:00:13.260
First Order, which I used
to introduce the MIT Mathlet

00:00:13.260 --> 00:00:14.380
collection.

00:00:14.380 --> 00:00:17.170
Its color coding,
placement conventions,

00:00:17.170 --> 00:00:20.750
and its functionalities
are identical to that one.

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:23.590
This applet represents
a mechanical system

00:00:23.590 --> 00:00:29.410
driven by the motion of
the far end of the dashpot.

00:00:29.410 --> 00:00:34.460
Let's begin by animating the
system to see how this works.

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:36.090
You can see the
dashpot is moving

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:40.420
up and down sinusoidally,
driving a mass in yellow.

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:42.970
And the mass is also
constrained by a spring

00:00:42.970 --> 00:00:46.390
at the top, attached to
a fixed wall at the top.

00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:48.130
Perhaps we should
animate this again,

00:00:48.130 --> 00:00:49.860
so you can see the
whole thing at work.

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:58.060
This applet, and its siblings,
show only the steady state

00:00:58.060 --> 00:01:00.710
or periodic solutions
to these equations.

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:03.380
They don't allow you to
pick initial conditions.

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:07.490
They don't represent the
effect of transients.

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:11.290
In the applet, x represents
the position of the mass,

00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:14.430
and you can see it
read off on this scale.

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:19.980
It's represented in yellow
on the graphing window here.

00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:26.670
And we declare x to be
zero when the spring is

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:30.150
exerting no force on the mass.

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:32.480
It's at rest.

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:34.710
We declare x to be
the output signal

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:38.280
of the system in the mathlet.

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:40.310
y denotes the position
of the plunger,

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:44.100
and it's read off
by this scale here.

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:48.680
We declare y to be the
input signal of the system.

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:50.510
Now the force
exerted by a dashpot

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:53.040
is proportional to
the relative velocity

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:57.050
of the cylinder and the
piston sliding inside of it.

00:01:57.050 --> 00:02:00.230
The proportionality
constant is called b.

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:03.340
As a consequence,
the right-hand side

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:05.790
of the equation controlling
the position of the mass

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:10.669
is b y dot, b times the
time derivative of y.

00:02:10.669 --> 00:02:13.000
This is a good example in
which the right-hand side

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.230
of a linear equation
in standard form

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:17.490
is not just the input signal.

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:20.940
In this case, it's not even a
multiple of the input signal.

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:24.751
It's a multiple of the
derivative of the input signal.

00:02:24.751 --> 00:02:26.790
The most important
case to study is

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:28.840
that in which the input
signal is sinusoidal,

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:31.400
and that's what is
represented here.

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:33.862
In the applet, we take the
amplitude of the input signal

00:02:33.862 --> 00:02:35.910
to be one.

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:38.460
If the amplitude of the
input signal is doubled,

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:41.780
so is its derivative,
and so by superposition

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:44.970
the amplitude of the output
signal would also be doubled.

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:47.830
So setting the input's
amplitude equal to one

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:51.270
isn't really a restriction.

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:54.630
In this situation, when
the input amplitude is one,

00:02:54.630 --> 00:03:00.690
the output amplitude is the
same as the gain of the system.

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:03.350
We can see how this
output amplitude depends

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:06.500
upon the input frequency
by opening the Bode Plot

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:08.850
window here.

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:10.600
This opens two windows.

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:14.300
The top one represents
the amplitude

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:19.400
of the system response, the
gain, as a function of omega.

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:22.200
And we can start
with omega small.

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:26.420
When omega equals zero, the
plunger isn't moving at all,

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:30.570
and the mass has no
reason to move either.

00:03:30.570 --> 00:03:36.980
So x equals zero, the spring
is relaxed, there's no motion.

00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:43.510
When omega increases, the
system response becomes greater.

00:03:43.510 --> 00:03:45.300
But you'll notice
something interesting.

00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:48.510
In this system,
when omega is small,

00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:52.170
the system response
leads the input signal.

00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:56.370
That is to say, the
phase lag is negative.

00:03:56.370 --> 00:03:58.380
And that's represented here.

00:03:58.380 --> 00:03:59.730
This is a little confusing.

00:03:59.730 --> 00:04:03.350
This is a graph of the negative
of the phase lag or the phase

00:04:03.350 --> 00:04:04.300
gain.

00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:13.130
And that's a positive angle, in
this system, for omega small.

00:04:13.130 --> 00:04:15.320
You can see the effect.

00:04:15.320 --> 00:04:17.630
The mass seems to be
pulling the plunger,

00:04:17.630 --> 00:04:20.579
although that's not
actually what's happening.

00:04:20.579 --> 00:04:24.710
When omega increases,
the amplitude

00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:29.000
of the system response increases
until a critical moment

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:33.750
when omega takes on
some critical value.

00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:37.080
This is the resonant
frequency of the system.

00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:39.230
And at this point,
the system response

00:04:39.230 --> 00:04:41.750
is identical to
the input signal.

00:04:41.750 --> 00:04:46.000
Shall we see what this looks
like by animating the system?

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:50.000
Now the plunger seems to
be locked to the piston.

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:53.710
That's not actually the case,
but the system is simply

00:04:53.710 --> 00:04:55.650
operating in harmony here.

00:04:55.650 --> 00:04:58.500
It's the resonant frequency.

00:04:58.500 --> 00:05:00.930
When omega increases
still further,

00:05:00.930 --> 00:05:04.080
then the system
response falls off.

00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:07.110
The phase lag becomes
positive, the response

00:05:07.110 --> 00:05:10.720
falls behind the input signal.

00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:15.030
And that's all visible from
the Bode plot pictures.

00:05:15.030 --> 00:05:17.500
As I look at this, I notice
something interesting.

00:05:20.540 --> 00:05:28.540
When the system response
reaches a maximum or a minimum,

00:05:28.540 --> 00:05:32.150
that's exactly the same moment
as when the system response

00:05:32.150 --> 00:05:36.220
curve crosses the
input signal curve.

00:05:36.220 --> 00:05:40.910
So in other words, the
amplitude of the output signal

00:05:40.910 --> 00:05:44.260
equals the value
of the input signal

00:05:44.260 --> 00:05:46.470
at the moment when they cross.

00:05:46.470 --> 00:05:48.700
Let's see if that is
always the case when

00:05:48.700 --> 00:05:50.430
I change the frequency here.

00:05:50.430 --> 00:05:53.230
That always seems
to be the case.

00:05:53.230 --> 00:05:55.450
Very interesting.

00:05:55.450 --> 00:06:00.760
And in fact, perhaps we should
change the values of b and k

00:06:00.760 --> 00:06:03.270
to see whether that
continues to be the case.

00:06:03.270 --> 00:06:07.380
Yes it just seems to
drag up and down there.

00:06:07.380 --> 00:06:11.920
And similarly, if I change the
value of the spring constant k,

00:06:11.920 --> 00:06:15.710
again that peak seems to move up
and down along the blue curve.

00:06:15.710 --> 00:06:16.340
Very odd.

00:06:16.340 --> 00:06:18.780
We'll come back to that.

00:06:18.780 --> 00:06:21.450
Here are some
further observations

00:06:21.450 --> 00:06:25.630
that you can see from
experimenting with this applet.

00:06:25.630 --> 00:06:27.890
First of all, let's
watch what happens

00:06:27.890 --> 00:06:31.920
if I change the value of
the damping constant b.

00:06:31.920 --> 00:06:36.184
I'm going to watch the Bode plot
over here, the amplitude Bode

00:06:36.184 --> 00:06:37.660
plot.

00:06:37.660 --> 00:06:41.080
Well, it changes, but one
thing that doesn't change

00:06:41.080 --> 00:06:44.800
is the position of the
resonant peak there.

00:06:44.800 --> 00:06:46.530
In other words, the
resonant frequency

00:06:46.530 --> 00:06:49.710
seems to be independent
of the value of b,

00:06:49.710 --> 00:06:52.032
of the damping constant.

00:06:52.032 --> 00:06:55.410
The second thing you can
observe, as I vary b,

00:06:55.410 --> 00:06:59.300
is when b is large, the
resonant hump is quite broad,

00:06:59.300 --> 00:07:04.360
but as b becomes smaller,
that spike becomes narrower

00:07:04.360 --> 00:07:07.680
and narrower and narrower.

00:07:07.680 --> 00:07:10.410
And the third thing you can
notice from looking at this

00:07:10.410 --> 00:07:13.380
is as b gets to
be small, the flip

00:07:13.380 --> 00:07:20.730
between phase lag of close
to minus pi over 2 to a phase

00:07:20.730 --> 00:07:25.070
lag of close to plus pi over 2
happens more and more abruptly

00:07:25.070 --> 00:07:29.820
as I change the frequency
from something small

00:07:29.820 --> 00:07:33.880
and cross through
that resonant peak.

00:07:33.880 --> 00:07:37.380
Now the system response is
ahead of the input signal.

00:07:37.380 --> 00:07:39.950
But it very quickly
flips to being

00:07:39.950 --> 00:07:43.250
behind it as you cross
the resonant frequency.

00:07:43.250 --> 00:07:46.040
And that transition happens
more and more rapidly

00:07:46.040 --> 00:07:48.530
as b gets to be small.

00:07:48.530 --> 00:07:50.170
Each one of these
three observations

00:07:50.170 --> 00:07:54.670
can be verified by calculation.

00:07:54.670 --> 00:07:58.610
The relationship between
the gain and the phase lag

00:07:58.610 --> 00:08:02.940
can be illustrated very well
using the Nyquist plot, which

00:08:02.940 --> 00:08:04.570
I'll open using this key.

00:08:07.260 --> 00:08:09.710
This is a plot of
the complex plane,

00:08:09.710 --> 00:08:14.850
and on it is drawn a
complex number in yellow.

00:08:14.850 --> 00:08:24.130
And that complex number has
a magnitude and an angle.

00:08:24.130 --> 00:08:29.240
The magnitude is the gain.

00:08:29.240 --> 00:08:35.750
This yellow strut is the same
length as this radius vector.

00:08:35.750 --> 00:08:41.400
And the angle is the
negative of the phase lag.

00:08:41.400 --> 00:08:42.270
It's the phase gain.

00:08:42.270 --> 00:08:46.880
So when the angle's positive
here, it goes through zero here

00:08:46.880 --> 00:08:49.450
and becomes negative
down here, when

00:08:49.450 --> 00:08:51.650
the phase lag becomes positive.

00:08:51.650 --> 00:08:59.240
So you can see why it is
that the resonant peak occurs

00:08:59.240 --> 00:09:03.030
at exactly the same instant
as when the phase lag is zero.

00:09:03.030 --> 00:09:08.629
That says that this
trajectory, this Nyquist plot,

00:09:08.629 --> 00:09:10.420
goes through this point,
which is the point

00:09:10.420 --> 00:09:14.990
1 in the complex plane,
where the angle is zero

00:09:14.990 --> 00:09:17.880
and the magnitude is 1.

00:09:17.880 --> 00:09:22.180
This trajectory is in fact
independent of either, both,

00:09:22.180 --> 00:09:23.610
of the system parameters.

00:09:23.610 --> 00:09:28.350
If I change them,
many things change,

00:09:28.350 --> 00:09:31.320
but the shape of this
trajectory, the Nyquist plot,

00:09:31.320 --> 00:09:34.480
is independent of those
two system parameters.

00:09:34.480 --> 00:09:39.530
And in fact, it's a circle
of radius 1/2 and center 1/2.

00:09:39.530 --> 00:09:43.600
You can verify that by
calculation as well.

00:09:43.600 --> 00:09:46.860
That fact explains
the observation

00:09:46.860 --> 00:09:51.920
we made earlier, that the
amplitude of the system

00:09:51.920 --> 00:10:00.190
response, the gain, seems to be
equal to the value of the input

00:10:00.190 --> 00:10:05.100
signal when that
maximum is achieved.

00:10:05.100 --> 00:10:09.880
In other words, the claim
is that the gain equals

00:10:09.880 --> 00:10:16.810
the cosine of the phase lag.

00:10:16.810 --> 00:10:22.370
The gain is the cosine
of the phase lag.

00:10:22.370 --> 00:10:29.240
This curve is given by the
equation the radius equals

00:10:29.240 --> 00:10:32.320
the cosine of the angle.

00:10:32.320 --> 00:10:35.460
r equals cosine theta
is a polar equation

00:10:35.460 --> 00:10:37.690
for this particular circle.

00:10:37.690 --> 00:10:41.710
And so the fact that this is a
circle is the same as the fact

00:10:41.710 --> 00:10:47.120
that we observed earlier, that
the solution curve crosses

00:10:47.120 --> 00:10:53.690
the input curve just when it
reaches a maximum or a minimum.

00:10:53.690 --> 00:10:56.950
Well, in addition to the spring
system shown in this applet,

00:10:56.950 --> 00:10:58.895
this very same equation
models the response

00:10:58.895 --> 00:11:01.170
of an AM radio receiver.

00:11:01.170 --> 00:11:03.640
The input signal is the
incoming radio signal,

00:11:03.640 --> 00:11:06.040
which contains
electromagnetic waves

00:11:06.040 --> 00:11:07.930
of many different frequencies.

00:11:07.930 --> 00:11:11.630
The output signal
feeds to the amplifier.

00:11:11.630 --> 00:11:13.970
You tune the radio to a
particular angular frequency

00:11:13.970 --> 00:11:17.400
by adjusting k, the spring
constant, which in the circle

00:11:17.400 --> 00:11:23.810
model is the capacitance, so
that the resonant frequency is

00:11:23.810 --> 00:11:27.160
the desired frequency
that you want to tune to.

00:11:27.160 --> 00:11:29.470
Then the output generated
by the other frequencies

00:11:29.470 --> 00:11:33.530
is much less than the output
generated by frequency omega_R.

00:11:33.530 --> 00:11:36.900
How much less depends on how
sharp the resonance spike is.

00:11:36.900 --> 00:11:39.540
The sharper the spike,
the better the tuning.

00:11:39.540 --> 00:11:41.820
You can make the spike
sharper by decreasing

00:11:41.820 --> 00:11:47.400
the value of b, which in the AM
radio model, is the resistance.
