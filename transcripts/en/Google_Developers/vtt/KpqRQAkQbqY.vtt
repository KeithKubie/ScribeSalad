TIMOTHY JORDAN: Hello!

00:00:00.916 --> 00:00:03.120
I'm Timothy Jordan, and
I'm back in the studio

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:04.504
in Mountain View, California.

00:00:04.504 --> 00:00:06.420
Let's get caught up with
the coolest developer

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:09.630
news from Google in
the last week or so.

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:11.970
You can now register for
Google Developer Days Europe,

00:00:11.970 --> 00:00:15.510
taking place on September
5 and 6 in Poland.

00:00:15.510 --> 00:00:18.000
We'll showcase our latest
developer product and platform

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.370
updates to help you
develop high-quality apps,

00:00:20.370 --> 00:00:22.410
grow and retain an
active user base,

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:25.230
and tap into tools to earn more.

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:27.960
There'll be technical talks,
hands-on training sessions,

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:30.150
and one-on-one time with
Googlers and members

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:32.860
of our Google Developer
Experts community.

00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:35.800

Festival in San
Francisco on the 23rd.

00:00:41.380 --> 00:00:44.260
If you're an indie developer
based in the US or Canada

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:47.650
and want to submit your
game, you have until August 6

00:00:47.650 --> 00:00:48.550
to do so.

00:00:48.550 --> 00:00:51.160
Just head on over to the post
linked in the description

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:52.357
below.

00:00:52.357 --> 00:00:54.940
We recently launched a developer
preview of the Android Things

00:00:54.940 --> 00:00:57.640
console, which allows you to
manage the software running

00:00:57.640 --> 00:01:00.880
on your fleet of Android
Things IOT devices,

00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:02.950
including creating
factory images

00:01:02.950 --> 00:01:04.989
as well as updating
the operating system

00:01:04.989 --> 00:01:07.570
and developer-provided APKs.

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:09.940
A tour of the console and
the features it offers

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:12.080
are on the post.

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:14.380
The Google People API
now has write endpoints

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:16.570
that allow you to create,
delete, and update

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:21.190
a single contact as well as
contact group endpoints to read

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:22.930
and write contact groups.

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:25.660
Code and screenshots
are on the post.

00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:30.280
Starting with the Firebase
functions module version 0.5.9,

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:32.650
there are now three
new types of database

00:01:32.650 --> 00:01:34.180
triggers you can write--

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:37.090
OnCreate, OnUpdate,
and OnDelete.

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:39.430

your code more efficient,

You can now use the Google
Cloud Platform region in London

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:47.080
to run applications and
store data in London.

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:49.240
This is our 10th region
and joins our existing

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:51.220
European region in Belgium.

00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:53.980

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:00.970
and includes
differentiated features

00:02:00.970 --> 00:02:03.400
for enterprise
security, extensibility,

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:06.370
hybrid networking, and
developer efficiency.

00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:08.680
Details are on the post.

00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:11.540
As developers, when starting a
new project on the Google Cloud

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:13.750
Platform, you may
find yourself trying

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:16.330
to decide between
different compute options--

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:20.020
Google Compute Engine, Google
Container Engine, App Engine,

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:22.570
or even Google Cloud
Functions and Firebase.

00:02:22.570 --> 00:02:23.740
Sound familiar?

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:27.310
If so, this handy
decision tree is for you.
