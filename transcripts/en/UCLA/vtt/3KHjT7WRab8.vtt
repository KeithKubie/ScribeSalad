00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:31.680
Family and friends of our graduates,
I present to you the graduating class of 2018

00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:34.560
from UCLA's College of Letters and Science

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:46.660
In the 99 year history of the
University of California at Los Angeles,

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:56.380
you are the most talented and most accomplished
and best-looking class to ever graduate.

00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:05.260
As we depart from our beloved home at
UCLA, I encourage you all to think about

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:08.140
how you have impacted your communities on campus.

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:12.400
The cloudless skies and 75 degree days 
will never change,

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:16.880
but something you did, something you participated in,

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:22.060
or a time when you exhibited leadership has
influenced the climate of our campus for the better.

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:27.560
More than anything, I hope that your experience at UCLA

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:31.340
has opened up some windows to the world
and leaves you yearning to know more.

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:34.900
Your undergraduate experience, 
obviously it's just the beginning,

00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:38.820
this is a commencement exercise
not a graduation exercise.

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:42.860
It's a life of continuing discovery.
Hopefully the skills you've acquired here,

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:46.780
the knowledge inside and outside the classroom

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:48.780
will serve you well in a rapidly changing world.

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:56.580
Bachelors, turn your tassels.

00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:02.480
Congratulations!  Go Bruins!
