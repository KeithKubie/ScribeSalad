00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.063
Hi. I'm Peter Norvig, and I'll be teaching  "the Design of Computer Programs" or CS212.

00:00:05.063 --> 00:00:09.024
This class is a follow up to CS101, or the equivalent

00:00:09.024 --> 00:00:13.074
in this class you will learn how to look at the description of a problem

00:00:13.075 --> 00:00:16.008
and come up with a good solution.

00:00:16.008 --> 00:00:18.039
You will learn that there are many choices along the way

00:00:18.039 --> 00:00:20.087
and that some of these choices are just a matter of taste

00:00:20.087 --> 00:00:23.097
and other choices have important repercussions.

00:00:23.097 --> 00:00:27.039
In short this class is about setting you on the path

00:00:27.039 --> 00:00:29.097
to developing good taste as a programmer.

00:00:29.097 --> 00:00:31.071
I hope you'll join me.

00:00:31.072 --> 00:00:34.019
"You said on your blog that it can take 10 years to be

00:00:34.019 --> 00:00:36.025
an expert programmer. What can students learn in 7 weeks?

00:00:36.025 --> 00:00:38.038
That's a great question. If you want to be

00:00:38.038 --> 00:00:41.010
a world-class expert at anything, whether it's computer programming

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:45.035
playing the violin, basketball, whatever, it is going to take years.

00:00:45.035 --> 00:00:49.021
But, that just means it's a great time to get started now.

00:00:49.021 --> 00:00:52.033
And if you're deliberative and think about what you're doing

00:00:52.033 --> 00:00:55.031
and keep on practicing, you can make a lot of progress

00:00:55.031 --> 00:00:57.036
in as short a time as seven weeks.

00:00:57.036 --> 00:01:00.008
CS212: The design of computer programs.

00:01:00.008 --> 99:59:59.000
Taught by Professor Peter Norvig
