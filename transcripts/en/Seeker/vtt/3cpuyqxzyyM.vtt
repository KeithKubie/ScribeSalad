00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:06.320
Chastity belts aren’t just a terrible contraption
medieval men used to ensure abstinence in

00:00:06.320 --> 00:00:07.830
their female partners.

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:13.339
They’re also prevalent in the animal kingdom,
in the form of mating plugs.

00:00:13.339 --> 00:00:18.840
The most common use of mating plugs in mammals
like rats, is for a male to ‘fortify’

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:26.910
his female fortress against invasions of foreign
sperm (aka any sperm that isn’t his).

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:31.610
Male rats have a few tricks that serve to
increase the likelihood of their own reproductive

00:00:31.610 --> 00:00:35.860
success - even after they’ve had sex with
a female.

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:42.030
When a rat ejaculates, in addition to sperm,
he will deliver an amorphous material with

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:44.330
a very sinister function.

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:51.440
This blobby gel-like plug starts off in liquid
form, and fills a female's’ vagina, blocking

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:55.610
it off to minimize sperm competition from
other males.

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:58.090
Basically, sealing the deal.

00:00:58.090 --> 00:01:03.410
As if having your genitals gummed up with
some kind of sticky substance wasn’t enough,

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:08.830
mating plugs can also contain ‘appeasement
substances’, which are chemical cues that

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:12.920
serve to decrease a female's’ sexual receptivity.

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:18.350
In other words, the mating plug works to block
a female from future sexual encounters both

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:21.760
physically and psychologically.

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:27.670
The whole notion of mate plugging seems horribly
unfair to females, and frankly, in a lot of

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:28.930
cases, it is.

00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:33.460
However, where there’s a will there’s
a way, and males that have not yet had the

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:40.240
opportunity to mate with a specific (plugged)
female will often work tirelessly to dislodge

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:45.000
her current plug before copulating and then
depositing one of their own.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:51.330
A female herself may also ‘groom out’
a mating plug by repeatedly licking, chewing,

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:53.430
or consuming it directly.

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:55.680
It IS high in protein after all!

00:01:55.680 --> 00:02:01.270
A female that is HAPPY with her sexual partner
may actually be on board with having her vagina

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:02.720
sealed up.

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:07.860
Indeed, females sometimes solicit something
called ‘post-ejaculatory mounting’ from

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:13.910
their male partners - which involves mounting
(not sex) and gives the plug more time to

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:18.620
harden while protecting it from being displaced
by another male.

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:24.910
As the female gives birth the plug is also
pushed out and she is once again free to mate...and

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:25.970
be re-plugged.

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:39.730
Again, and again, and again.
