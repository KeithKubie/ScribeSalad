00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:04.920
We know by instinct that humour is pretty important in relationships

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:07.940
But the reasons are often left a little vague

00:00:07.940 --> 00:00:13.000
It isn't that we crudely want entertainment, there are enough comedians on the TV

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:21.280
We don't just want to laugh per se. For 2 people to be able to tolerate one another over time, we need to laugh

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:25.980
in the nicest way, at our partner and at ourselves.

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:34.420
Spending time closely around someone inevitably exposes us to constant departures from what we could call normality or balance.

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:40.620
Our partners will be a little crazy in many areas and we will be too, of course.

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:47.380
They might turn out to ring their mother 5 times a day, clean the kitchen as if the surgery was gonna be performed there

00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:49.160
always insist on inviting friends around

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:53.420
or want to ride to the airport 6 hours before a flight

00:00:53.640 --> 00:01:00.040
We need to say something but doing so directly and in a serious voice can be painfully counterproductive

00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:08.320
Too often, the partner just feel swiftly attacked and refused from inside leading to spiceful irritation and bitterness

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:11.500
And this is where humour comes in

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:17.700
Humour is the most effective way to criticizing another person without arousing their irritation or self-righteousness

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:24.140
Their laughter isn't just fun, it's a sign that they've have acknowledged and attempted to reform them.

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:29.040
If people tend to get annoyed when critisism is delivered in a serious tone

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:34.900
it's that they can't see the extent to which their attitudes have abandoned proportion and balance

00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:38.480
They are unable to spot their deviation from mature mean

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:46.520
So the comedic gesture involve subjecting the troublesome aspect of the other to extreme exaggeration

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:48.720
which then jolts them to the recognition of the problem

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:56.000
while at the same time offering them a relief of feeling that they are of course quite that bad.

00:01:56.100 --> 00:02:04.260
In the late 1980s, the then Bristish Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher grew increasingly authoritarian with her colleagues and fellow politicians

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:09.740
Serious-minded articles appeared in newspapers urging the Prime Minister to be more .. and impathetic.

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:13.320
It didn't work at all, Mrs. Thatcher simply got offended and dug in

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:17.560
But then a comedy show using puppets called Spitiing Image

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:25.260
turned the Prime Minister in to a deep voice psychopathic matron with a tendency to whack a naughty colleague over the head with a truncheon

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:27.980
This obviously wasn't what Mrs. Thatcher actually behaved

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:33.540
and yet it was a 10-fold of exaggeration of a real and painful truth about her

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:39.100
Remarkably, presented in this form, the Prime Minister can see the point

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:43.500
felt assuage by the wildness of exaggeration and was in a position to laugh at herself

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:48.140
In her mermoir, she recalled tuning into the program and chuckling,

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:53.860
realizing that she would henceforth need to learn to reign in a tendency that clearly have gotten out of hand.

00:02:54.220 --> 00:03:00.080
The comedy show was a rehearsing move we all need constantly to make in our relationships

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:06.000
Here to we should use the tactic of kindly comic exaggeration to point out the failing of another person

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:13.000
Imagine responding to a partner who become a little too agitate to any sign of dust in the kitchen

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:20.440
In answer, we might massively overplace the gravity of the issue and insist: "Let's commit suicide over the breadcrums by the sink,

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:23.000
you are right, life is no longer worth living on this term.

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:29.660
We can nip round to the late night pharmacy get a bottle of sleeping pill or else I'll just take the bread knife to those larger veins in our ankle.

00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:33.760
Soon we will have to worry about these messy world any longer.

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:35.880
Come on it could even be fun."

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:43.080
One word, during this speech you need to be chirpy, relaxed with just a playful twitch of the lips as on elaborated of technical details

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:46.360
The comedians know tone is everything.

00:03:46.460 --> 00:03:52.040
The comic move is the blow up departure from the norm to such manifesting absurd proportion

00:03:52.240 --> 00:03:57.000
that even the partner can see them for what they always were: overreaction.

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:02.460
Comedy skillfully teaches us that the way to get someone to see that have overreacted

00:04:02.460 --> 00:04:05.400
is not to sound matured and reasonable

00:04:05.460 --> 00:04:10.600
It is continue to pump up the problems until the overreaction becomes so clear

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:15.980
so benign by its outside dimension that our audiences start to laugh

00:04:15.980 --> 00:04:23.400
We have learned to critize through humour and our relationship will be a whole lot more secured as a result

00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:31.360
especially when we allow our lovers to magnify our own feelings into jokes in turn.
