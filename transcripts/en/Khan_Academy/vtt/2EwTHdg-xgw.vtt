00:00:00.236 --> 00:00:03.575
- Christine works in a
movie store in her hometown.

00:00:03.575 --> 00:00:05.956
Using the store's total selection,

00:00:05.956 --> 00:00:09.009
she documented the price
of each movie title

00:00:09.009 --> 00:00:11.537
and how many years it has been since

00:00:11.537 --> 00:00:13.893
it was featured in movie theatres.

00:00:13.893 --> 00:00:16.424
She plotted the points below.

00:00:16.424 --> 00:00:18.970
So let's see what's going on below here.

00:00:19.554 --> 00:00:21.279
Looks like there's two
curves that she tries to fit.

00:00:21.279 --> 00:00:23.718
I'm assuming we're going to
read about it in a second.

00:00:23.718 --> 00:00:25.877
But these blue points are the data points.

00:00:25.877 --> 00:00:29.457
So, for example, this
data point right over here

00:00:29.457 --> 00:00:33.852
shows a movie that the
title costs six dollars,

00:00:33.852 --> 00:00:37.076
and it has been released
for almost two years,

00:00:37.076 --> 00:00:38.526
a little under two years.

00:00:38.526 --> 00:00:40.551
This data point right
over here, this is a movie

00:00:40.551 --> 00:00:43.543
that has been released
for almost four years,

00:00:43.543 --> 00:00:46.076
looks like maybe three
and three quarters years.

00:00:46.076 --> 00:00:49.355
And they're selling that,
looks like for a dollar

00:00:49.355 --> 00:00:50.748
or even a little bit less than a dollar.

00:00:50.748 --> 00:00:52.648
So those are her data points.

00:00:52.648 --> 00:00:53.958
So once, again, she documented the price

00:00:53.958 --> 00:00:58.958
of each movie title as
a function of how many

00:00:59.539 --> 00:01:03.043
years it's been since it was
featured in movie theatres.

00:01:03.043 --> 00:01:05.856
She is looking for a function
that models her data.

00:01:05.856 --> 00:01:08.586
Since the trend of the data
is decreasing and convex,

00:01:08.586 --> 00:01:11.430
and you see it here, it's
definitely decreasing,

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:15.361
and convex, it's opening
upwards, if you imagine a curve,

00:01:15.361 --> 00:01:18.378
it looks like it's opening
upwards a little bit like that,

00:01:18.378 --> 00:01:22.883
so decreasing and convex,
she found a decreasing convex

00:01:22.883 --> 00:01:27.883
exponential model and a
decreasing convex quadratic model.

00:01:27.899 --> 00:01:32.243
Which of the following
functions better fits the data?

00:01:32.703 --> 00:01:34.851
Function A, this is an exponential.

00:01:34.851 --> 00:01:37.999
This is the one in green right over here.

00:01:37.999 --> 00:01:42.999
And Function B, this one right
over here is a quadratic.

00:01:43.747 --> 00:01:48.180
And you can see this one in purple.

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:51.612
And so, which one of those
better fits the data?

00:01:52.642 --> 00:01:55.098
If we look at what's going on here,

00:01:55.098 --> 00:01:58.083
the green function, the exponential one,

00:01:58.083 --> 00:02:00.764
most of the data points
for any given duration,

00:02:00.764 --> 00:02:02.899
for how long the title's been out,

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:05.601
it looks like it's
consistently underestimating.

00:02:05.601 --> 00:02:09.123
That it's always, the model's guess,

00:02:09.123 --> 00:02:11.816
or what the model would say the price is,

00:02:11.816 --> 00:02:16.530
is always, essentially except
for only one data point

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:18.822
right over here, for all
of these other data points

00:02:18.822 --> 00:02:21.313
it's underestimating
what the price would be.

00:02:21.313 --> 00:02:25.173
The purple model or the purple
function right over here,

00:02:26.033 --> 00:02:29.090
it has more of a balance
between overestimating,

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:33.060
right over here, it's
overestimating by a little bit,

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:34.639
and underestimating.

00:02:34.639 --> 00:02:36.333
And its underestimates are closer,

00:02:36.333 --> 00:02:39.844
and its overestimates are
closer than this green model.

00:02:39.844 --> 00:02:44.844
So I would say that Function B
is definitely a better model.

00:02:45.657 --> 00:02:47.977
Use the function of best
fit, so we're going to say

00:02:47.977 --> 00:02:50.907
Function B, to predict
the price of a movie

00:02:50.907 --> 00:02:54.281
that was featured in
theatres 5.5 years ago.

00:02:54.281 --> 00:02:56.604
Round your answer to the nearest cent.

00:02:56.604 --> 00:02:59.677
So 5.5 years ago, that's
going to be right over here.

00:02:59.677 --> 00:03:02.477
We're going to go to Function
B, which is this purple one.

00:03:02.477 --> 00:03:05.307
So it's going to be under a dollar.

00:03:05.307 --> 00:03:07.083
But we want to get something
to the nearest cent,

00:03:07.083 --> 00:03:11.417
so let's actually use the actual
definition of the function.

00:03:11.417 --> 00:03:14.486
So this is price as a function of how long

00:03:14.486 --> 00:03:16.229
the movie has been released.

00:03:16.229 --> 00:03:18.320
Where x is how long it's been released,

00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:20.283
and y is its price.

00:03:21.652 --> 00:03:25.475
If x is 5.5, let's figure
out what y is going to be.

00:03:26.628 --> 00:03:31.628
So y is going to be equal
to 0.5 times x squared.

00:03:32.688 --> 00:03:37.688
So x is 5.5 squared.

00:03:40.388 --> 00:03:43.957
So then we have minus five times x again.

00:03:43.957 --> 00:03:46.427
So minus five times 5.5.

00:03:46.427 --> 00:03:48.890
And then we have plus 13.

00:03:48.890 --> 00:03:51.189
And what does that get us?

00:03:51.189 --> 00:03:53.790
That gets us 62 1/2 cents.

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:56.448
If we were to round our
answer to the nearest cent,

00:03:56.448 --> 00:04:00.053
that's going to be 63 cents.

00:04:00.391 --> 00:04:02.298
And we got it right.
