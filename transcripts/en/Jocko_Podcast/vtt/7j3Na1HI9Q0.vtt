00:00:00.640 --> 00:00:03.220
Dakota, do you still respect people without discipline?

2
00:00:06.160 --> 00:00:08.590
Interesting. Okay. So first of all,

3
00:00:08.591 --> 00:00:13.540
my baseline as a person is to respect people. That's my baseline. Now,

4
00:00:13.570 --> 00:00:17.440
that is not the same as something we've talked now about before,

5
00:00:17.441 --> 00:00:20.800
which is that doesn't mean I expect a lot from them. Okay?

6
00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:23.880
You see the big difference there? I respect people. Hey, I respect you,

7
00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:24.611
Spec what you're doing.

8
00:00:24.611 --> 00:00:28.930
That doesn't mean I expect that you're going to be humble or you're going to be

9
00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:30.430
hardworking or you're going to be brave,

10
00:00:30.431 --> 00:00:33.310
or you're going to even be a slightly diff, decent human being.

11
00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:36.130
I don't expect any of that, but yeah,

12
00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:40.540
but I w and let me, let me phrase this carefully.

13
00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:43.840
That doesn't mean I don't treat them with respect.

14
00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:45.960
Now you notice I just changed this. Yes.

15
00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:49.030
It's not just about I actually respect you. It's,

16
00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:52.750
I'm going to treat you with respect. There's a big difference, right?

17
00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:55.660
I'm going to, I'm going to treat everyone with respect.

18
00:00:55.900 --> 00:00:59.650
But as far as actually respecting someone,

19
00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:04.660
um, no, no, I'm not just automatically respecting people.

20
00:01:04.690 --> 00:01:07.360
Now I'll treat them with respect because I don't know who they are.

21
00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:11.050
I don't know what struggles they've had in their life.

22
00:01:11.110 --> 00:01:13.660
I don't know what they've been through. I don't know that.

23
00:01:13.661 --> 00:01:15.310
So I'm going to treat him with respect.

24
00:01:15.311 --> 00:01:20.050
And it's very similar to Jujitsu perspective. You don't know. Okay.

25
00:01:20.410 --> 00:01:24.130
Do you do to perspective Nogi, right? You don't know how good someone is.

26
00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:29.980
You don't. You don't. And this is another thing, when do you,

27
00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:33.070
when do you know how good someone is? And let's say you're better than them.

28
00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:35.530
If you really understand Jujitsu,

29
00:01:36.010 --> 00:01:39.130
you realize that you're better than them because you've been training longer.

30
00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:41.410
Yeah, fundamentally. Right? Of course.

31
00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:44.590
Are there some people that are just amazing athletes? Sure, sure.

32
00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:48.100
But 98% of the people, you've just been training longer than them,

33
00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:53.110
or you just were born a lot bigger than them or a lot stronger than them.

34
00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:56.410
But you look at them and say, you know what, if this person, hey,

35
00:01:56.411 --> 00:01:58.840
if we flip this around and this person been training longer,

36
00:01:58.900 --> 00:02:01.260
I'd be the one getting crushed. Right?

37
00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:05.860
So there's that now. So, so yes,

38
00:02:05.861 --> 00:02:10.780
I treat people with respect and my, my attitude is generally to say,

39
00:02:10.781 --> 00:02:12.250
look, I don't know what they've been through so I'm going to,

40
00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:16.690
I'm going to treat him that way. Now that being said,

41
00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:21.780
when someone just throws away their potential because they lack discipline,

42
00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:29.480
that kind of bothers me. I mean, it doesn't mean that I don't respect them,

43
00:02:29.481 --> 00:02:31.670
but I am definitely disappointed.

44
00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:38.450
And in conditions where there is a gross lack of discipline,

45
00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:40.940
just a gross lack of discipline,

46
00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:46.480
I do move beyond just mere disappointment and I do get into the realm of,

47
00:02:46.521 --> 00:02:50.570
I do not respect that person because they lacked discipline. So

48
00:02:52.070 --> 00:02:52.903
there you go.

49
00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:57.020
So it's like a respect meter kind of thing and you're starting at the base line.

50
00:02:57.050 --> 00:03:00.610
Yeah. Yeah. I always start with everyone with respect.

51
00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:05.350
You're to treat everyone with respect. And if you don't,

52
00:03:06.490 --> 00:03:10.750
you don't know who you're disrespecting. Right? Who are you disrespect? I mean,

53
00:03:10.751 --> 00:03:11.920
you could be disrespecting, first of all,

54
00:03:11.921 --> 00:03:15.910
you could be disrespecting someone that is been through a lot that maybe you

55
00:03:15.911 --> 00:03:18.270
should learn from. You could be, you know,

56
00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:19.810
you're walking down the street and you disrespect.

57
00:03:19.811 --> 00:03:23.020
You could disrespect someone that's a psychopath with a gun. Yeah.

58
00:03:23.770 --> 00:03:27.280
And now you're in a shootout with them. People are getting, you know, I mean,

59
00:03:27.281 --> 00:03:31.840
you're probably gonna win if you train hard, but still ugly innocence might be,

60
00:03:31.841 --> 00:03:33.780
you know, by standards, you know, just don't know here.

61
00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:35.390
You just know who people are. Yeah.

62
00:03:35.570 --> 00:03:37.930
That's a good lesson to learn from his Jitsu man.

63
00:03:38.020 --> 00:03:39.820
You don't know how good people are. You don't know,

64
00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:41.630
not just how well they train,

65
00:03:41.631 --> 00:03:44.950
but what are they been through that day in their life. You know,

66
00:03:44.951 --> 00:03:48.580
you meet some people in the wrong day and there could be really a real problem.

67
00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:48.970
Yeah.
