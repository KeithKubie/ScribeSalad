00:00:01.280 --> 00:00:03.740
Whales Don’t Spray Water Out of Their Blowholes

00:00:03.740 --> 00:00:04.740
Myth: Whales spray water out of their blowholes.

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:09.099
Contrary to what you may have seen in such
movies as Pixar’s otherwise extremely entertaining

00:00:09.099 --> 00:00:12.900
Finding Nemo, whales don’t spray water out
of their blowholes.

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:17.300
Further, the whale’s trachea doesn’t connect
to the esophagus of the whale; so when Dory

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:21.590
and Marlin went down the whale’s throat,
in real life, they’d have simply been eaten.

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:25.580
(Another interesting thing about Finding Nemo
is that when the mother died, the father would

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:30.370
have turned into a female and become the mother-
clownfish are all born male with the dominate

00:00:30.370 --> 00:00:33.550
male of a group becoming female when the female
of the group dies.

00:00:33.550 --> 00:00:38.170
Also, Coral, Marlin’s wife, should have
been bigger than Marlin, not smaller as depicted

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:39.170
in the movie.)

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:43.410
Whales, of course, are mammals that live in
the ocean, but scientists believe that whales

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:47.589
were once land mammals that adapted to live
in the sea, likely because the sea held a

00:00:47.589 --> 00:00:51.879
more bountiful supply of food than the land
did at the time that they made the switch.

00:00:51.879 --> 00:00:56.219
Whatever the case, when whales inhale, they
flex a muscle which opens the blowhole and

00:00:56.219 --> 00:00:57.800
take in a big gulp of air.

00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:01.820
Then, they relax the muscle to close the blowhole,
leaving them free to dive down beneath the

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:05.010
surface of the water once more without drowning
themselves.

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:08.060
It’s exhaling that’s the interesting part.

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:12.310
When the whale resurfaces, they have to release
the used up air back into the atmosphere just

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:13.719
like all other mammals do.

00:01:13.719 --> 00:01:18.140
This results in a spout, but it isn’t water
(at least not at first).

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:21.799
The air inside the whale is typically quite
warm from the whale’s body heat.

00:01:21.799 --> 00:01:25.969
When it’s exhaled, it meets the much cooler
temperature of the air outside and immediately

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:28.680
condenses, making it look like a spout of
water.

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:33.289
(This is also often mixed with mucus —it
is a nose, after all!)

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:37.020
The great thing for avid whale watchers is
that every species of whale has a differently

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:42.100
shaped blowhole (some even have two!) which
results in differently shaped spouts.

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:46.159
Because of this, an experienced whale watcher
can tell what species of whale is nearby just

00:01:46.159 --> 00:01:47.619
by seeing their spouts.

00:01:47.619 --> 00:01:51.689
For instance, a humpback whale’s spout looks
like a column; orcas’ spouts are somewhat

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:56.640
more bushy; and gray whales’ two blowholes
are positioned in such a way that their exhalation

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:59.640
results in something of a heart-shaped spout.

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:03.649
As a rule, baleen whales—those whales who
don’t have teeth, but rather have baleen

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:08.340
plates to filter food out of the water—have
two blowholes, while toothed whales have just

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:09.390
one blowhole.

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:12.790
Types of baleen whales include the humpback,
blue, and gray whales.

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:17.251
(This is, of course, another inaccuracy in
Finding Nemo as that was a humpback whale

00:02:17.251 --> 00:02:19.690
that they showed having only one blowhole.)

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:24.260
Meanwhile, toothed whales include sperm whales
and beluga whales, among others.

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:28.650
Interestingly, the blowhole of a sperm whale
is actually located on its left side rather

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:30.200
than right on top of its head.

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:32.360
It’s technically a “left nostril.”

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:36.799
While they don’t have a right nostril, they
do have a right nasal passage that is fully

00:02:36.799 --> 00:02:39.099
developed; it just lacks an opening.

00:02:39.099 --> 00:02:42.790
Luckily for whales, they don’t have to keep
coming up for air every few minutes like we’d

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:43.790
have to.

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:47.260
Sperm whales, for instance, can hold their
breath for about an hour and a half.

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:51.470
Part of their ability to stay underwater so
long comes down to the size of their lungs

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:56.011
which are, as you can imagine, pretty large
(to give you an idea, a blue whale’s lung

00:02:56.011 --> 00:03:00.099
capacity is 5000 litres, or 1320 gallons).

00:03:00.099 --> 00:03:04.900
However, it also has to do with the way whales
are able to process the air that goes in.

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:09.540
It’s estimated that whales use about 90%
of the oxygen that enters their lungs, making

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:10.890
the most of each breath.

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:16.450
In comparison, humans are estimated to use
only about 15% of the oxygen we breathe.

00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:19.950
Bonus Facts:
• Another whale of an error in Finding Nemo

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:24.849
is when they depict the humpback whale as
having a uvula- whales don’t have those.

00:03:24.849 --> 00:03:32.660
• “Mr. Ray” in Finding Nemo was depicted
as a female, lacking claspers used for mating.

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:36.310
• Dory and Marlin should have never been
able to encounter an angler fish, as they

00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:40.890
are found in depths of greater than 1,000
meters- an environment the stalwart pair could

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:41.890
not have survived in.

00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:47.860
• After a female clownfish lays her eggs,
neither she nor the male fish that fertilized

00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:52.129
the eggs have anything further to do with
their offspring.

00:03:52.129 --> 00:03:56.730
• An episode of Seinfeld features Kramer
accidentally hitting a golf ball into a whale’s

00:03:56.730 --> 00:03:58.760
blowhole—a “blowhole in one.”

00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:02.810
The whale washes up on shore and George has
to pretend to be a marine biologist to save

00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:05.569
it by simply plucking the ball out of the
blowhole.

00:04:05.569 --> 00:04:09.239
This would have been impossible, trained marine
biologist or not.

00:04:09.239 --> 00:04:12.890
First off, a golf ball likely wouldn’t have
been an obstruction, as it would have landed

00:04:12.890 --> 00:04:17.489
atop the nasal plug used to keep seawater
out during dives, and then blasted off when

00:04:17.489 --> 00:04:18.880
the whale exhaled.

00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:23.039
If somehow it did get past the nasal plug,
it’s doubtful the whale would have tolerated

00:04:23.039 --> 00:04:27.470
George sticking his whole arm in and even
if it did, his arm wouldn’t have fit into

00:04:27.470 --> 00:04:31.750
the nasal cavity and into the larnyx, nor
would a golf ball likely be big enough to

00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:33.280
block the larnyx.

00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:37.490
If one did get down that far, the whale would
simply eject it, according to marine biologist

00:04:37.490 --> 00:04:38.900
Dr. Joy Reidenberg.

00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:44.220
(For reference, humpback whales can sneeze
air at over 300 mph, which would have shot

00:04:44.220 --> 00:04:47.750
that golf ball out quicker than Kramer hit
it, even if sucked in.)

00:04:47.750 --> 00:04:53.100
Finally, the whale depicted was a baleen whale,
meaning it had two nostrils so if one nostril

00:04:53.100 --> 00:04:57.060
was clogged, they could still breathe.

00:04:57.060 --> 00:05:00.820
• As a consequence of the fact that the
whale’s trachea and esophagus are not connected,

00:05:00.820 --> 00:05:04.759
it’s next to impossible for them to choke
on food, unless they somehow suck something

00:05:04.759 --> 00:05:08.599
in through their blowhole that they can’t
get out.

00:05:08.599 --> 00:05:11.430
• If whales have to breathe consciously,
how do they sleep?

00:05:11.430 --> 00:05:14.900
They can’t fall fully asleep because they
wouldn’t get up to breathe otherwise.

00:05:14.900 --> 00:05:17.860
Instead, they allow one half of the brain
to sleep at a time.

00:05:17.860 --> 00:05:34.840
That way, they’re able to rest but can also
make the decision to go up for air when necessary.
