Steve: Phones are the the main way that people
access satellite navigation data nowadays.

00:00:05.069 --> 00:00:10.650
We have all sorts of other
receivers but this is what we'll tend to

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:15.470
have and so that's the illustration I'm
going to be using today.

00:00:15.640 --> 00:00:17.940
Brady: There are satellites up there your phone works out

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:19.980
where's one and it goes "how far am I from it."

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:21.680
Is it something like that?

00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:23.680
Steve: It's
pretty much like that and but the

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:27.000
details are a little bit more
interesting.

00:00:29.180 --> 00:00:33.951
We have a series of satellites traveling
above our heads about 22,000 kilometers

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:40.559
away, broadcasting a signal; and the main
part of that signal is the time; so if

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:44.879
you think of the satellite as a giant
clock in space about the size of a

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:49.770
double wardrobe with huge great wings on
either side with solar panels, that's what

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:56.190
our satellites look like, and they're
broadcasting 24-7 the time and with that

00:00:56.190 --> 00:01:01.890
time signal it's also broadcasting a little
bit of information about the health of

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:06.210
the satellite, whether it is on the right
orbit, whether it's clock is as accurate

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:10.560
it could be and they're constantly
comparing the time on the satellite

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:17.549
clock with a much more accurate, I say much
more accurate, and another atomic clock

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:23.700
on on the ground which it will tell the
satellite that it's clocks are running

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:29.790
either slightly slow or slightly fast or
they're gaining X number of nanoseconds a

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:35.400
week or a year or whatever, and
that will be broadcast down to the

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:39.689
receiver and it will tell the receiver
all the information it needs to know to

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:45.180
go to calculate the time precisely. It
will also add a little bit extra

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:49.920
information it will tell the the
receiver where to see and where to find

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:53.820
the other satellites in the
constellation, so that once you found one,

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:59.620
that will tell you how far it is away
from one particular satellite.

00:01:59.620 --> 00:02:04.220
Imagine that in the middle of here is a
satellite, and it's broadcasting the time.

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:08.789
The surface of the balloon is an
equidistant time from the satellite.

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:11.431
We know cause we've picked up the signal at somewhere

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:18.340
on the surface of this balloon is us; but
without a little bit more information we

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:22.940
could be anywhere within the radius of tens of
thousands of kilometers perhaps.

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:29.400
So, this is where it all gets complicated, but I need
about three hands, but if we did it take

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:34.900
a second satellite broadcasting the time.
Brady: Do you want me to hold one for you?

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:41.530
Steve: I think I might just be able to manage it.
But, we then have a circle of

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:50.260
intersection, and I now know the time i'm
somewhere along that circle. That's still

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:58.570
an awful lot of room to play with so I
ask another satellite to tell me

00:02:58.570 --> 00:03:05.920
the time, and that satellite we interact
on a circle like that, so now i know that

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:11.050
I could be either of those two places.
Still not very good because being in two

00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:13.210
places at once doesn't really help
anyone.

00:03:13.210 --> 00:03:20.380
So we take information from another
satellite, and that will give us one

00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:24.670
single point where I could be. This is
the point is probably thousands of miles

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:28.720
in outer space. That is the way in which
we use the time signal from the

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:31.720
satellites to tell us exactly where we
are.

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:34.720
If only it was as easy as that, it
would be great. Brady:  I was going to say so

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:38.050
surely you know, I'm driving on the
motorway that's going to be out-of-date

00:03:38.050 --> 00:03:44.260
quite quickly Steve: That is refreshed
several times every second, then the

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:46.720
refresh rate is about 50 times a second,

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:50.830
so even if you're traveling along in a
motorway the jet fighter it will keep up

00:03:50.830 --> 00:03:54.190
with you, don't worry. I've mentioned we
have an accurate time coming from the

00:03:54.190 --> 00:04:00.400
satellite. The satellite is broadcasting
on a radio wave which is traveling at

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:05.830
the speed of light; over 22,000
kilometers it's going to hit you about

00:04:05.830 --> 00:04:12.970
0.07 of a second after it's released from
the satellite. The satellite has accurate

00:04:12.970 --> 00:04:18.070
clocks, you don't. If you were able to
stick an atomic clock for around about

00:04:18.070 --> 00:04:22.240
50k into your mobile phone you will be
able to

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:26.199
compete with satellites for accuracy of
timing. The trick is to make the

00:04:26.199 --> 00:04:32.650
satellites share the time and make this
into an atomic accuracy clock. If we want

00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:37.300
to know the height, the distances West
the distant North sounds, that's three

00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:41.470
unknowns, two unknowns, three civil
taneous equations can solve it by

00:04:41.470 --> 00:04:45.280
putting the fourth one and we get four
dimensions, the fourth dimension being

00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:54.130
time; and so all of a sudden my gps
receiver, my phone is showing the

00:04:54.130 --> 00:05:01.389
same level of nanosecond precision and
timing that the satellites are.

00:05:01.389 --> 00:05:04.990
We're pretty good at working out what an orbit looks like, and even though the

00:05:04.990 --> 00:05:09.610
satellite is traveling at about seven
kilometers a second, we know where they

00:05:09.610 --> 00:05:14.770
are; but even though we think of space is
fairly empty there are influences that

00:05:14.770 --> 00:05:18.460
might not that satellite off its exact
orbit
