00:00:08.466 --> 00:00:11.726
Ann: Where as many of the abstract
expressionist artists began

00:00:11.726 --> 00:00:17.022
as figurative painters, Ad Reindhart
began as a geometric painter.

00:00:17.052 --> 00:00:20.681
Very much following in the
footsteps like many American artists

00:00:20.681 --> 00:00:25.791
at that time of Piet
Mondrian and the geometric,

00:00:25.791 --> 00:00:29.984
almost rhythmic patterns
of his early work.

00:00:30.231 --> 00:00:34.758
He limited his palette to
a very few select colors:

00:00:34.758 --> 00:00:40.516
white, red, blue and ultimately
by the end of the 50s black.

00:00:40.914 --> 00:00:44.278
A color to which he
devoted himself exclusively

00:00:44.293 --> 00:00:46.952
through up until his death
at the end of his 60s.

00:00:46.952 --> 00:00:49.956
The sensibility of his
pictures is a mystical one.

00:00:49.956 --> 00:00:53.782
Like most of the abstract expressionist
painters there's no figures

00:00:53.782 --> 00:00:57.954
or any indication of landscape
that the viewer can connect to.

00:00:58.338 --> 00:01:02.960
Instead it's really the painting
itself, the making of the painting

00:01:03.083 --> 00:01:07.102
and perhaps even more important
the perception of the painting

00:01:07.132 --> 00:01:08.636
that matters to Reinhardt.

00:01:08.636 --> 00:01:14.142
With the black paintings especially,
his interests are very clear.

00:01:14.295 --> 00:01:18.616
When you first look at a black
square painting by Reinhardt

00:01:18.616 --> 00:01:20.714
you really just see a black square.

00:01:21.729 --> 00:01:26.454
But when you continue to focus and
look at it a little while longer

00:01:27.115 --> 00:01:31.130
what you'll see emerging from
the depths of that black surface

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:36.474
is a cross going from top
to bottom and side to side

00:01:36.474 --> 00:01:38.607
in the center of the canvass.

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:43.635
In which you can read different
colors embedded in that black

00:01:43.635 --> 00:01:49.488
and emerging through the black,
rewarding the viewer who takes the time

00:01:49.581 --> 00:01:53.339
to really look and really
be patient with the picture.

00:01:53.815 --> 00:01:58.169
For all of the abstract
expressionists, this is a key priority.

00:01:58.215 --> 00:02:02.077
They're making paintings
that take time to unfold.

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:05.344
They're making paintings
that can't be glanced at

00:02:05.344 --> 00:02:07.679
or walked passed quickly.

00:02:08.263 --> 00:02:12.845
In this way the abstract expressionists
I think thought of their works

00:02:12.845 --> 00:02:15.763
almost as the holders of secrets.

00:02:15.763 --> 00:02:18.644
One can initiate one's
self into those secrets

00:02:18.644 --> 00:02:24.145
without having to say any magic
password or anything like that,

00:02:24.145 --> 00:02:27.288
but just by spending time.

00:02:27.626 --> 00:02:32.781
For those Philistines, the abstract
expressionists would have said

00:02:32.781 --> 00:02:37.924
who did not even know enough or
care enough to spend the time.

00:02:38.416 --> 00:02:43.805
They would walk right by these
canvasses with no idea of what treasures

00:02:43.805 --> 00:02:45.630
lay within them.

00:02:45.906 --> 00:02:50.180
I think that just pleased
these artists totally fine.

00:02:50.656 --> 00:02:54.417
Their work was made to
communicate with a certain level

00:02:54.417 --> 00:03:02.346
of like-minded or like-spirited
viewers who were ready

00:03:02.346 --> 00:03:04.674
for what they were providing them.

00:03:04.674 --> 00:03:07.721
If those viewers had to
do something to prove it

00:03:07.721 --> 00:03:12.298
like stand in front of the painting
a little while, all the better.
