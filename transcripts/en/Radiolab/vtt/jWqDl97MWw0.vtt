1
00:00:01.060 --> 00:00:01.110
Alright.

2
00:00:01.110 --> 00:00:04.980
Latif if you can rewind your mind back to a time when your life wasn't dominated

3
00:00:04.981 --> 00:00:09.440
by Alan Fund and Candy Camera. Like how did, how does it start? So I first, I,

4
00:00:09.441 --> 00:00:14.280
I di unlike a lot of people, I did not grow up watching candid camera.

5
00:00:14.281 --> 00:00:18.360
I had never heard of candid camera when I was younger. Never. Or candid camera.

6
00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:19.280
No. Well,

7
00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:22.320
how have you heard of the declaration of independence that ring the bell?

8
00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:25.890
Did Allen Funt right there? No, but it's sort of, he's up there with it.

9
00:00:25.891 --> 00:00:28.920
It's very noticeable. Okay. Okay, cool.

10
00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:32.100
He is actually a no, no BS,

11
00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:35.760
a founding father in a way of, of a different story. Hey,

12
00:00:35.761 --> 00:00:40.260
I'm Jad Abumrad I'm Robert Krulwich Radiolab when you least expect it.

13
00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:44.520
Your executive order, the one today. Just to set that up.

14
00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:49.380
So there used to be a time in our media history where like the line between show

15
00:00:49.381 --> 00:00:51.300
and life was really clear.

16
00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:56.040
Then along came a guy named Allen Funt who muddied that line in a way that was

17
00:00:56.041 --> 00:00:59.340
fascinating and would bite him in the butt. In fact, uh, spiritually speaking,

18
00:00:59.341 --> 00:01:01.290
I think those bite marks are on all of our butts.

19
00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:05.490
So check your Tush and listen to the story from our producer Latif Nasser.

20
00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:09.680
So I first heard about cannon camera a few years ago and I, when I did,

21
00:01:09.681 --> 00:01:14.570
I just dove in deep. Like I just binged all of,

22
00:01:14.571 --> 00:01:17.180
I watched every single clip I could get my hands on.

23
00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:21.380
And then that's around the time when I found out that it started as a radio

24
00:01:21.381 --> 00:01:25.040
show, which was even more interesting to me cause I was like a radio show.

25
00:01:25.041 --> 00:01:28.100
I was like w like how does that even make sense? Like what does that even,

26
00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:29.390
what would that be?

27
00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:33.770
So I called up one of the few people who have studied this.

28
00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:36.920
That's right. Um, so I'm Jacob Smith,

29
00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:41.240
an associate professor at Northwestern University School of communication and

30
00:01:41.241 --> 00:01:44.420
the director of Northwestern's masters in sound arts and industries.

31
00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:48.980
And it turns out there's this kind of wonderful, kind of creepy backstory.

32
00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:52.090
Do you just want to start with World War Two? Yeah.

33
00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:55.060
So during World War Two,

34
00:01:55.630 --> 00:02:00.010
Alan Funt was working in the signal corps is known as the nerves of the, uh,

35
00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:04.060
the kind of communications arm for the armed forces at that time. So fun.

36
00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:06.130
He's a, a few years out of college by this point.

37
00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:09.280
He is stationed in Oklahoma at Camp Gruber.

38
00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:14.140
And his job there is to make radio shows for the armed forces radio.

39
00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:19.090
One of these shows, it's called the great booth. The Gripe GRI p.

40
00:02:19.091 --> 00:02:22.300
E the gripe booth. Yeah. Basically the show worked like this.

41
00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:26.530
Fun would get told your station at the camp to come into his studio and talk

42
00:02:26.531 --> 00:02:30.550
about their gripes, about like their barracks and about the food and about,

43
00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:33.460
you know, their girlfriend is cheating on them back home or whatever, you know,

44
00:02:33.461 --> 00:02:37.330
things that were bothering them. Thinks it's a very good idea for morale. Oh,

45
00:02:37.331 --> 00:02:39.340
I think it's a great idea from her. I really,

46
00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:42.850
I would imagine it would bring the soldiers down. It would bring them down,

47
00:02:42.851 --> 00:02:45.760
but maybe it would bring them together. Fair enough. Anyhow,

48
00:02:45.761 --> 00:02:49.720
so he's bringing these soldiers into his little recording studio and one of the

49
00:02:49.721 --> 00:02:53.800
things that he found was that as soon as the red light would go on to indicate

50
00:02:53.801 --> 00:02:57.550
that recording was going on, they'd clam up.

51
00:02:57.880 --> 00:03:01.440
They would get tongue tied. This idea was actually called Mike Fright, Mike,

52
00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:02.520
Right? Mike Fry.

53
00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:07.350
<v 1>And he tells these stories about how it was amazing to see these soldiers who</v>

54
00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:11.640
would go out into battle without maybe blinking an eye but break into a cold

55
00:03:11.641 --> 00:03:15.220
sweat at the thought of sitting in front of a microphone. So what was,

56
00:03:15.221 --> 00:03:16.500
what's he do? What does he do? Well,

57
00:03:16.501 --> 00:03:21.420
so his solution was to disconnect the red light and record them secretly.

58
00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:25.240
<v 0>So basically he'd bring them in and say, okay, let's just do a practice around,</v>

59
00:03:25.241 --> 00:03:26.560
let's just talk over the things that,

60
00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:30.940
the kinds of things you will talk about just for practice. And then when,

61
00:03:30.941 --> 00:03:33.820
then finally they were ready to start, he'd be like, no, no, I already got it.

62
00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:37.770
<v 1>He would get better material when they didn't know they were being recorded.</v>

63
00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:39.600
Would they be okay with that? Like you said,

64
00:03:39.601 --> 00:03:43.050
well you would get like a mission afterwards. So is that a lie? No,

65
00:03:43.051 --> 00:03:47.190
I don't think it's lie anymore. It's a sort of truth deferred, you might say

66
00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:52.980
<v 0>[inaudible] but according to Jacob Smith Fund was like, this is a great trick.</v>

67
00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:56.010
<v 1>Yes. You know, the red light goes off in the great booth,</v>

68
00:03:56.011 --> 00:03:59.610
but a red light goes on in funds mind. And so after the war,

69
00:03:59.670 --> 00:04:02.190
he pitches this idea as candid microphone.

70
00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:03.580
<v 0>What kind of microphone,</v>

71
00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:06.720
<v 1>which goes on the air on ABC in 1947</v>

72
00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:09.780
<v 0>no program that brings you the secretly recorded conversation live.</v>

73
00:04:09.781 --> 00:04:13.020
All kinds of people as they react in real life.

74
00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:17.680
Do all kinds of situations. No one ever knows when he's talking.

75
00:04:20.130 --> 00:04:22.730
[inaudible] me, me, me, me, me, me.

76
00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:26.670
Mm. No.

77
00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:28.430
Alright,

78
00:04:28.430 --> 00:04:33.430
so this is Sonny Fox and he was one of the original guys to work with Alan on

79
00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:39.380
candidate microphone. And it just so happened when he came into our studio,

80
00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:44.330
we managed to catch him on our candid microphone. Can you hear me?

81
00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:49.420
I can. That is tepid water. Tepid water. I'm, I'm sorry the water's not, uh,

82
00:04:49.550 --> 00:04:52.610
you know, not to my life up to snuff and my standards.

83
00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:55.730
Why is my throat so tidy? That's the tepid water.

84
00:04:55.731 --> 00:04:59.140
Now all of a sudden that's not so a bourbon would've helped.

85
00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:03.860
All right. Okay. We're here to talk about much more exciting things I think.

86
00:05:04.580 --> 00:05:08.230
So when you were working with Alan on candidate microphone, what was he like?

87
00:05:08.230 --> 00:05:11.330
Like how did you see him like, yeah, that was a very able,

88
00:05:11.331 --> 00:05:15.230
very bright young guy at, he had a face of an every man.

89
00:05:15.260 --> 00:05:19.370
These big chipmunk cheeks rather short and a little plump probably was about

90
00:05:19.371 --> 00:05:22.390
five, 10. And uh,

91
00:05:22.430 --> 00:05:27.430
he could charm you when he wanted to show me right out of your shoes or he could

92
00:05:27.831 --> 00:05:31.730
be wildly maniacal,

93
00:05:31.850 --> 00:05:34.550
overwrought person. I mean, he had this huge temp,

94
00:05:34.970 --> 00:05:38.810
Tony says when they were just starting to show sometimes Alan would get so mad,

95
00:05:38.960 --> 00:05:42.860
he would throw things sometimes like throwing pencils at other producers. Well,

96
00:05:42.861 --> 00:05:45.740
there were only four of us and the secretary, that was it.

97
00:05:46.040 --> 00:05:50.790
That was the core of what we did. And we all had to do everything. I mean, Alan,

98
00:05:51.300 --> 00:05:52.190
the hidden microphone,

99
00:05:53.930 --> 00:05:57.170
that man was Allen Allen was the auditor obviously of whether we did something

100
00:05:57.260 --> 00:06:00.650
didn't just happen. You feel what was like, what was the goal for the show?

101
00:06:00.720 --> 00:06:01.970
The goal was to,

102
00:06:02.140 --> 00:06:06.950
I was to reflect people as they are in their unguarded Amish.

103
00:06:07.310 --> 00:06:10.460
We try to bring you the real Macaulay on candid microphone.

104
00:06:10.520 --> 00:06:13.790
That's what fascinated fun. The beauty of everyday conversation.

105
00:06:14.100 --> 00:06:17.930
We go out of the studio into the world everyday life kept your rock handed

106
00:06:17.950 --> 00:06:19.310
glimpses of people like you.

107
00:06:19.460 --> 00:06:23.840
What the sociologist Erving Goffman calls bugging the backstage, right?

108
00:06:23.841 --> 00:06:27.920
So what we would do is every day Sonny and crew would go to their office in

109
00:06:28.540 --> 00:06:32.870
Manhattan's room office, sit down at their desks and think up ideas separately,

110
00:06:32.871 --> 00:06:34.940
scratching our heads and say the Allan, what about

111
00:06:35.470 --> 00:06:39.300
<v 2>I have, I gave every day if I'm gay, my wife gets right after me.</v>

112
00:06:39.380 --> 00:06:42.320
<v 0>Like, what if we bugged a barbershop or a magazine stand? Oh,</v>

113
00:06:42.350 --> 00:06:43.950
maybe that's something we could, you know?

114
00:06:44.080 --> 00:06:46.960
<v 2>Yeah, things are green or green,</v>

115
00:06:47.030 --> 00:06:49.310
<v 0>a restaurant or shoe store. I don't know where.</v>

116
00:06:50.180 --> 00:06:53.840
So what they do is they take this big clunky portable recorder.

117
00:06:53.870 --> 00:06:58.280
It was like a suitcase. It weighed, I think maybe 60 pounds,

118
00:06:58.340 --> 00:07:00.680
but they put a handle on top and said it's supportable.

119
00:07:01.010 --> 00:07:05.870
He says that they would lug around this massive suitcase to wherever it was they

120
00:07:05.871 --> 00:07:09.200
were recording and they try to hide it so that no one would see it.

121
00:07:09.201 --> 00:07:11.810
So they could record this tape, which they did

122
00:07:13.710 --> 00:07:17.870
in all these different locations, including the women's bathroom.

123
00:07:17.930 --> 00:07:20.180
<v 2>I don't know. I could say I really don't.</v>

124
00:07:20.500 --> 00:07:21.980
<v 0>But by and large, uh,</v>

125
00:07:21.981 --> 00:07:25.700
the tape they gathered front was disappointed to discover that it was the most

126
00:07:25.701 --> 00:07:30.530
uninteresting garbage you could imagine. Yeah. It was frustrating.

127
00:07:30.650 --> 00:07:35.180
It doesn't have, you know, the nice shape, the rise and fall,

128
00:07:35.660 --> 00:07:38.420
the climax that, um, is gonna keep listeners hooked.

129
00:07:38.960 --> 00:07:39.793
<v 3>No,</v>

130
00:07:40.060 --> 00:07:43.180
<v 0>that presented us with indeed problem. They had a half hour show,</v>

131
00:07:43.360 --> 00:07:46.870
prime time that they needed to fill. Here's how desperate I was.

132
00:07:46.900 --> 00:07:50.830
I was having a date first date with a young woman. Yeah.

133
00:07:51.010 --> 00:07:55.870
I bugged my car and try to see how she would sound on a first date.

134
00:07:56.230 --> 00:07:58.960
She found out about that it was not amused. And that was the last day.

135
00:07:59.260 --> 00:08:01.690
How did it go though? I was not very interesting.

136
00:08:02.560 --> 00:08:06.220
You got to that point where anything was, you were so desperate to get stuff,

137
00:08:06.710 --> 00:08:08.500
you did unlikely things like that.

138
00:08:08.530 --> 00:08:12.400
So here they had this show that was supposed to be about real people,

139
00:08:12.401 --> 00:08:15.250
real talk everyday conversation, but turned out that sucked.

140
00:08:15.310 --> 00:08:18.850
So then the question became, how can we mix it up? How can we stir it up?

141
00:08:18.851 --> 00:08:22.930
How can we, um, change this into something more spectacular?

142
00:08:23.110 --> 00:08:26.320
And that's when Ellen Fun added a little wrinkle.

143
00:08:26.440 --> 00:08:29.740
It's something that Jacob Smith has called. I was calling it the Rhio.

144
00:08:32.350 --> 00:08:35.660
So the basic idea of the [inaudible] is that instead of just letting people

145
00:08:35.661 --> 00:08:39.650
Yammer on, which didn't seem to work, you gotta get in there,

146
00:08:39.980 --> 00:08:43.440
you've gotta juice the action to get that right shape.

147
00:08:43.740 --> 00:08:46.500
<v 2>My man with a hitting Mike had a good one when he dropped in the tailor shop.</v>

148
00:08:46.860 --> 00:08:50.230
<v 0>What'd you start to hearing? Candid. Mike is like these strange situation.</v>

149
00:08:50.410 --> 00:08:55.410
Like he would go into a tailor shop with a microphone up his sleeve and would

150
00:08:56.101 --> 00:08:56.934
ask the guy,

151
00:08:56.990 --> 00:09:01.650
<v 2>I have to have food and clothes made up for kangaroo kangaroo. That's right.</v>

152
00:09:03.140 --> 00:09:04.160
Oh, you can handle that.

153
00:09:04.390 --> 00:09:07.510
<v 0>Like here's another one. Play the moaning Trump. This is sunny, his favorite.</v>

154
00:09:07.570 --> 00:09:08.780
He says that, uh,

155
00:09:08.800 --> 00:09:12.580
one day they called a mover to come over to their office to move this trunk

156
00:09:14.710 --> 00:09:15.880
and inside the trunk.

157
00:09:15.881 --> 00:09:20.881
The mover did know this was a guy and his job was to sound Erie to basically

158
00:09:21.700 --> 00:09:23.830
moon. Every time they move or tried to move that trunk,

159
00:09:24.010 --> 00:09:25.620
just be very gentle or where they were there.

160
00:09:28.440 --> 00:09:33.380
<v 2>What did you nevermind. Just just take it by the makeup. Nice. I wondered a lot.</v>

161
00:09:34.320 --> 00:09:38.240
Just forget it. I'm blessing now. We've been trying to get rid of those things.

162
00:09:39.890 --> 00:09:44.210
[inaudible] delivered to 180 I give us mass slip. What do you mean a slip?

163
00:09:44.450 --> 00:09:46.080
I want to have a sickness. You're not delivered there.

164
00:09:46.081 --> 00:09:48.680
I want to have to take an aside for that. My goddess look for man.

165
00:09:49.800 --> 00:09:50.170
<v 0>Oh,</v>

166
00:09:50.170 --> 00:09:55.170
the Phil's got off such great mo classic format that works for Alan.

167
00:09:56.400 --> 00:09:59.890
We're just getting people into situations where they were fresh.

168
00:10:00.110 --> 00:10:03.500
<v 2>No, it's not your business whatsoever, which makes up kind of noise.</v>

169
00:10:03.560 --> 00:10:07.610
There's no noise. You don't hear anything said to me and I don't hear anything.

170
00:10:08.300 --> 00:10:10.460
Come on. Oh, we've been waiting since last night.

171
00:10:10.461 --> 00:10:11.720
Let's get this thing out of here.

172
00:10:11.990 --> 00:10:14.780
<v 0>It just keeps going and going and going. Gives me the three.</v>

173
00:10:15.080 --> 00:10:19.770
<v 2>Did the ambulance come on? Don't in mind what it is now.</v>

174
00:10:19.860 --> 00:10:23.430
<v 0>Just driving them nuts. What's in a drunk until finally</v>

175
00:10:26.480 --> 00:10:27.030
<v 4>[inaudible]</v>

176
00:10:27.030 --> 00:10:29.310
<v 2>here's your $20 they look for another man.</v>

177
00:10:29.420 --> 00:10:31.850
<v 0>They lose their temper and we get cue the music</v>

178
00:10:37.650 --> 00:10:37.900
<v 4>[inaudible]</v>

179
00:10:37.900 --> 00:10:41.890
<v 0>the climax. That's the closure. Now the whole thing has a shape.</v>

180
00:10:41.980 --> 00:10:45.490
It starts slow and then crescendo, crescendo, crescendo, boom.

181
00:10:45.550 --> 00:10:49.180
He's inventing this new kind of new format of entertainment.

182
00:10:49.690 --> 00:10:51.070
It sounds totally obvious,

183
00:10:51.130 --> 00:10:54.700
but this is basically like reality TV in a nutshell.

184
00:10:54.820 --> 00:10:59.820
Like this is one of the first times where you have that familiar hybrid of this

185
00:11:00.040 --> 00:11:03.430
highly artificial and constructed situation.

186
00:11:03.670 --> 00:11:06.460
But then inside of it of snippet of life,

187
00:11:07.540 --> 00:11:10.960
we've all been there situations where we've been frustrated where we don't

188
00:11:10.961 --> 00:11:12.250
understand what's going. Yeah.

189
00:11:12.690 --> 00:11:16.660
Situations where we'd be welded to fun would start pushing this format,

190
00:11:16.690 --> 00:11:19.690
tweaking it, changing it, trying out new permutations.

191
00:11:19.691 --> 00:11:23.950
And sometimes it's very much like a fly on the wall. You know, these,

192
00:11:24.010 --> 00:11:28.840
these kind of poignant segments of listening to,

193
00:11:29.580 --> 00:11:31.480
<v 2>Huh. Um, it's time to get up</v>

194
00:11:31.690 --> 00:11:33.300
<v 0>a wife trying to wake up her husband. Yes.</v>

195
00:11:33.980 --> 00:11:38.430
<v 2>Ah, delving the clock nine 15 minutes ago. Hi Evan. Right up.</v>

196
00:11:38.540 --> 00:11:42.170
<v 0>Yeah. That one's kind of beautiful. Uh, the temporary Zermatt guilty.</v>

197
00:11:42.230 --> 00:11:44.450
So intimate is what's so incredible, right?

198
00:11:44.530 --> 00:11:46.770
<v 2>Got a lot to do today. You're supposed to be in early</v>

199
00:11:47.150 --> 00:11:49.130
<v 0>and this one fund got the wife to be in on the gag.</v>

200
00:11:49.290 --> 00:11:52.760
<v 2>Come on darling. You can keep it. That's all stolen. Huh?</v>

201
00:11:53.890 --> 00:11:55.920
What was your wrap on? I wrote this,

202
00:11:55.960 --> 00:12:00.400
I'll bring up this three along with your please get up. Please go away.

203
00:12:03.490 --> 00:12:07.820
Tom. I think if you take a shower, you feel good. I think if you go here,

204
00:12:09.160 --> 00:12:12.310
I don't like you talking to me that way once and for all.

205
00:12:12.311 --> 00:12:16.720
I insist that you get up out of the bed. All right, I'm up.

206
00:12:17.070 --> 00:12:21.460
I'm awake. Let's say you move, it's very late. It's nine o'clock,

207
00:12:21.550 --> 00:12:22.420
nine o'clock.

208
00:12:23.490 --> 00:12:28.440
<v 1>So you know, you get this beautiful backstage glimpse of everyday life,</v>

209
00:12:28.470 --> 00:12:30.060
but where do we stop?

210
00:12:30.480 --> 00:12:34.350
And obviously it did prompts letters that you hit this and cap called.

211
00:12:34.590 --> 00:12:37.980
Have you heard the one where I was just listening to it the other day where, um,

212
00:12:38.490 --> 00:12:41.940
where listener writes in to complain about that one? Yeah. Yeah.

213
00:12:41.941 --> 00:12:44.790
That was actually really cool. Yeah. But tell us, tell us, tell us about it.

214
00:12:44.820 --> 00:12:45.510
Well, so

215
00:12:45.510 --> 00:12:49.230
<v 2>one lady took us at our word and wrote us a few well chosen ones that really</v>

216
00:12:49.231 --> 00:12:50.064
made our ears,

217
00:12:50.200 --> 00:12:53.590
<v 1>she's writing into complaint that this was, you know, crossing the line. Right?</v>

218
00:12:53.710 --> 00:12:56.590
So what Funt does is he goes up to her door to talk to her,

219
00:12:57.010 --> 00:12:58.450
but he goes with a hidden mic.

220
00:12:58.630 --> 00:13:00.660
<v 2>I wear the American Broadcasting Company.</v>

221
00:13:00.661 --> 00:13:03.330
And I wonder if I could have just a couple of minutes of your time.

222
00:13:04.310 --> 00:13:06.360
Is that all right? Yeah. Uh,

223
00:13:06.420 --> 00:13:10.140
you wrote the letter the other day about one of our program called a candid

224
00:13:10.141 --> 00:13:14.100
microphone and I got it from your letter that you don't like it very much. No,

225
00:13:14.101 --> 00:13:18.690
I don't. Well why, what are some of the things you find objectionable about it?

226
00:13:20.860 --> 00:13:24.560
Well, I don't like it because I think it's snooping. I don't know anything

227
00:13:24.690 --> 00:13:25.530
<v 1>out notes.</v>

228
00:13:26.090 --> 00:13:26.923
<v 2>Is that right?</v>

229
00:13:27.540 --> 00:13:31.680
In your letter you said you said a Lillian instead of a little more strongly.

230
00:13:31.681 --> 00:13:35.780
Is that you thought were a bunch of dirty sneaking fine. Well, um,

231
00:13:36.750 --> 00:13:40.650
I suppose at the time, and I was listening to the program, I felt that way.

232
00:13:40.820 --> 00:13:45.420
You get these people in their homes extemporaneously. I had that one program,

233
00:13:45.810 --> 00:13:50.100
uh, about the, the, you went into the man bedroom. Oh,

234
00:13:50.101 --> 00:13:53.510
you mean the one where I wear a white, uh, awakened the hardest wagon,

235
00:13:53.550 --> 00:13:55.410
the husband and never depart fellow.

236
00:13:56.010 --> 00:13:59.490
He didn't know who he was talking for thinking for the public.

237
00:13:59.570 --> 00:14:02.070
If they sort of put him in a bad light, don't you think?

238
00:14:02.300 --> 00:14:03.300
Well you might have something. Yeah,

239
00:14:03.301 --> 00:14:06.940
but don't you think it's funny that the man make money awakened? Yeah.

240
00:14:07.050 --> 00:14:07.591
That's funny.

241
00:14:07.591 --> 00:14:11.070
But there are only for him though and his own bedroom and I'm sure he doesn't

242
00:14:11.071 --> 00:14:12.800
enjoy having the whole world know about it.

243
00:14:13.270 --> 00:14:18.180
You or do you think most people are [inaudible] from top countries in front of a

244
00:14:18.181 --> 00:14:21.210
microphone? Not Anymore. I think most people take to,

245
00:14:21.211 --> 00:14:25.390
and I could talk very nicely. Do you feel, you talked at about the same way.

246
00:14:25.500 --> 00:14:28.350
If you know you knew you were talking about Michael Ball right now,

247
00:14:29.610 --> 00:14:32.560
that'd be no different. What do I know different? Well now look,

248
00:14:32.580 --> 00:14:35.900
let me show you. This is the microphone and what you've just said is,

249
00:14:36.280 --> 00:14:39.470
is ready to go out from coast to coast. Does that make any difference?

250
00:14:41.460 --> 00:14:45.910
Then I said, good, fine. Thanks. Good away

251
00:14:47.500 --> 00:14:49.980
your mind I coming in here and talking to you this way.

252
00:14:50.100 --> 00:14:53.870
Do you think we took unfair advantage of you? I think so. At the moment,

253
00:14:54.200 --> 00:14:56.270
the conversation may not be worth the nickel,

254
00:14:56.271 --> 00:14:58.190
but would you like to have it on the air?

255
00:15:01.810 --> 00:15:05.480
Yes. Gosh, I would.

256
00:15:05.930 --> 00:15:08.450
Because I want the whole world to know.

257
00:15:09.270 --> 00:15:11.910
I have my opinion on this presence.

258
00:15:12.390 --> 00:15:16.120
<v 0>Oh my God, that's amazing. She just switched. Exactly. And, and,</v>

259
00:15:16.130 --> 00:15:19.710
and you can hear in her voice this, this weird tension, right?

260
00:15:20.070 --> 00:15:23.640
I have this one advisor, her name is Sheila Porsche. She has this idea,

261
00:15:23.641 --> 00:15:25.860
I'm bastardizing it. But to put it crudely,

262
00:15:25.861 --> 00:15:29.010
like we all kind of have these two drives,

263
00:15:29.340 --> 00:15:32.190
one drive for privacy.

264
00:15:32.340 --> 00:15:36.360
We don't want people in our bedrooms listening to us.

265
00:15:36.390 --> 00:15:40.650
That is the height of creepiness. And then on the other hand,

266
00:15:40.680 --> 00:15:45.210
we have this drive for publicity. It's exciting to be the star,

267
00:15:45.211 --> 00:15:47.610
and it's exciting to have people pay attention to you.

268
00:15:47.910 --> 00:15:52.170
And these two drives to drive for privacy and the drive for publicity are sort

269
00:15:52.171 --> 00:15:56.200
of competing in us. So coming up that tension,

270
00:15:57.130 --> 00:15:58.930
well, it just takes off. Literally.

271
00:15:59.120 --> 00:16:02.100
<v 5>No, actually, literally have takes up. Yes. Yeah. And it gets super interesting.</v>

<v 0>Hey, I'm Jad Abumrad. I'm Robert Krulwich Radiolab.</v>

295
00:17:40.871 --> 00:17:44.880
Let's get back to our story from a producer Latif Nasser about Alan Funt,

296
00:17:44.890 --> 00:17:46.870
the man with a hidden microphone where we left off.

297
00:17:46.900 --> 00:17:51.200
He had just made a radio show called candid Mike. Well, so is it,

298
00:17:51.210 --> 00:17:55.380
did in fact people like this program? Was it a hit? Oh yeah. Yeah.

299
00:17:55.530 --> 00:17:57.290
It moves pretty quickly to television.

300
00:17:57.610 --> 00:17:59.670
<v 8>Adam, good camera with Allan. Fun</v>

301
00:17:59.720 --> 00:18:02.480
<v 0>in the spring of 1949 the show premiers on NBC.</v>

302
00:18:02.530 --> 00:18:04.300
<v 8>Welcome to the candid camera program</v>

303
00:18:04.570 --> 00:18:08.240
<v 0>in the show. It's the exact same premise, setup weird or frustrating situations.</v>

304
00:18:08.241 --> 00:18:11.660
Try and catch people's reactions. But when the show goes out on TV,

305
00:18:11.690 --> 00:18:15.710
here's the man who, according to Jacob Smith, it just doesn't catch on.

306
00:18:16.180 --> 00:18:18.670
A lot of viewers think that it's mean-spirited,

307
00:18:19.540 --> 00:18:23.290
that the subjects are being somehow, um, mistreated.

308
00:18:23.320 --> 00:18:27.600
There were critics who were very unnerved and upset by it.

309
00:18:27.601 --> 00:18:30.660
There were people certainly, but what, what did the critics say? Oh Man,

310
00:18:30.661 --> 00:18:32.430
I made a list here of,

311
00:18:32.550 --> 00:18:36.960
of a whole bunch of the criticisms from the forties and fifties and there are

312
00:18:36.961 --> 00:18:41.580
great. They're like, so like they're so sweeping. So, okay. So, um,

313
00:18:41.700 --> 00:18:46.680
so there was this one guy in the New Yorker, this is in 1950, um, who said,

314
00:18:46.710 --> 00:18:50.040
and I love this, I love this for my money.

315
00:18:50.070 --> 00:18:53.610
Candid camera is sadistic, poisonous,

316
00:18:53.820 --> 00:18:58.590
anti human and sneaky. Uh, there was another,

317
00:18:58.620 --> 00:19:00.900
hold on, there was another kind of great string of adjectives.

318
00:19:00.900 --> 00:19:05.370
Let me just find it. Um, there's so many of these here. Uh,

319
00:19:05.380 --> 00:19:09.060
another guy for different guy from the New Yorker. He, he found, uh,

320
00:19:09.840 --> 00:19:14.840
Allen Funt course nagging suspicious and misanthropic and to make matters worst

321
00:19:15.990 --> 00:19:17.520
zestfully so,

322
00:19:21.540 --> 00:19:25.050
wow. But I mean, I think that becomes kind of a PR problem that he has to fix.

323
00:19:25.380 --> 00:19:28.350
And according to Jacob Smith, it was not a small problem. No.

324
00:19:28.410 --> 00:19:31.080
When it first aired, and even all through the 50s,

325
00:19:31.110 --> 00:19:35.040
the show it's on and off doesn't really get its audience.

326
00:19:35.120 --> 00:19:40.120
It moves around different networks and all the while he's tweaking it and

327
00:19:40.291 --> 00:19:42.810
changing it, adapting it. And in the early sixties,

328
00:19:44.100 --> 00:19:49.100
he hits on some [inaudible] a second little tweak that would make them all the

329
00:19:49.911 --> 00:19:53.120
different funds. Term was the reveal,

330
00:19:55.580 --> 00:19:58.610
the reveal. Now he'd done it here and there,

331
00:19:58.611 --> 00:20:00.790
but by 1962 he locks it in.

332
00:20:00.800 --> 00:20:04.130
You start to see this thing happen over and over at the end of segments. It's,

333
00:20:04.220 --> 00:20:08.510
it's so commonplace now that it seems crazy. Someone even had to invent it.

334
00:20:08.600 --> 00:20:12.330
Classic reveal is like [inaudible] the killing. Uh,

335
00:20:12.510 --> 00:20:17.510
the gag is in a diner and they're serving this guy a tiny little teacup and what

336
00:20:17.711 --> 00:20:18.544
is it?

337
00:20:20.740 --> 00:20:25.450
And he wanted a big coffee mug and they serve in this tiny little tea cup and

338
00:20:25.451 --> 00:20:29.880
he's like, what, what's going on? So this guy gets pissed off and,

339
00:20:29.881 --> 00:20:33.490
and previously front would have let that keep going. But now

340
00:20:35.070 --> 00:20:39.850
as the guy is about to blow fund either walks out himself or he sent someone out

341
00:20:40.150 --> 00:20:42.100
and they, they kinda grabbed the guy and they're like,

342
00:20:42.460 --> 00:20:43.300
do the camera in the back.

343
00:20:44.860 --> 00:20:47.790
They show him the hidden camera on camera.

344
00:20:47.791 --> 00:20:51.410
And as he's looking at that hidden here and he's like, Huh,

345
00:20:51.930 --> 00:20:56.470
the camera zooms in on his face and Jacob Smith says a bit.

346
00:20:56.490 --> 00:21:00.540
Sometimes fun would even actually have to hold the people in place for that very

347
00:21:00.541 --> 00:21:04.110
moment because one of their first reactions are to turn away or to cover their

348
00:21:04.111 --> 00:21:04.944
face.

349
00:21:05.040 --> 00:21:08.310
So he would sometimes have to physically restrain them and turning them towards

350
00:21:08.311 --> 00:21:12.690
the camera so that they can capture that one fleeting moment.

351
00:21:13.200 --> 00:21:17.200
And in that moment you see so much on their face. They're, they're angry,

352
00:21:17.201 --> 00:21:19.150
they're embarrassed, they're ashamed, they're confused,

353
00:21:19.420 --> 00:21:22.120
they don't know how to feel. And then right at that moment,

354
00:21:22.600 --> 00:21:25.650
font says the magic words smile.

355
00:21:25.980 --> 00:21:30.570
You're on candid camera. And it's all, everything's Abdullah,

356
00:21:30.630 --> 00:21:34.560
all the sudden aide. Okay. Everything is it. Okay. And then the core is,

357
00:21:34.561 --> 00:21:38.610
but what you least expected, you did, you're the star today.

358
00:21:39.690 --> 00:21:43.290
Smile. You're on candid camera. Yeah.

359
00:21:45.720 --> 00:21:50.490
Something, something hocus pocus. You're in focused. Yes. It's your lucky day.

360
00:21:51.780 --> 00:21:53.840
That's interesting. So it went from being like who you are.

361
00:21:53.850 --> 00:21:56.670
You've been creeping bio to like, Oh,

362
00:21:56.671 --> 00:22:01.170
thank you Alan Fund and this works much better. I take, yeah,

363
00:22:01.171 --> 00:22:02.690
it was hugely successful. Well,

364
00:22:02.710 --> 00:22:07.570
it was one of the top ranked shows from basically all of the early 1960s

365
00:22:07.720 --> 00:22:11.170
millions, if not tens of millions of people watched it. Uh,

366
00:22:11.350 --> 00:22:15.880
and I think part of the reason why was that without that sort of meanness,

367
00:22:16.070 --> 00:22:21.070
they'd bled out the meanness and people could now sort of freely see it as what

368
00:22:21.941 --> 00:22:22.840
it really was,

369
00:22:22.841 --> 00:22:27.580
which were these kind of little people's into human nature.

370
00:22:27.610 --> 00:22:31.060
Like the first one I ever saw was the elevator sketch.

371
00:22:31.120 --> 00:22:35.050
Do you know the elevator to walk me through? Oh, the elevator sketch.

372
00:22:35.080 --> 00:22:39.940
It's just really simple. It's really simple and it's so beautiful.

373
00:22:40.720 --> 00:22:44.330
The gentleman in the elevator now is a candid star.

374
00:22:44.450 --> 00:22:48.340
The basic setup is guy walks into an elevator. There's a hidden camera.

375
00:22:48.430 --> 00:22:52.150
He doesn't know it is a fellow with his hat on in the elevator.

376
00:22:52.810 --> 00:22:56.410
He is like everybody else wearing his overcoat and a hat and he stands in the

377
00:22:56.411 --> 00:22:57.340
middle of the elevator.

378
00:22:57.520 --> 00:23:02.260
And then all of the other people in the elevator who we later learned our

379
00:23:02.470 --> 00:23:05.050
confederate, uh, they, um,

380
00:23:06.340 --> 00:23:10.940
take off their hat and one by one by one, one hand off, two hats off,

381
00:23:11.120 --> 00:23:11.953
five hats off,

382
00:23:12.310 --> 00:23:14.900
and you're watching them through the open elevator door and he's just sort of

383
00:23:14.901 --> 00:23:17.750
standing there awkwardly. And then he'd just sort of

384
00:23:19.490 --> 00:23:23.540
hesitantly is he just takes off his hat and then holds it in front of his,

385
00:23:23.560 --> 00:23:27.530
you know, chest procedure.

386
00:23:28.070 --> 00:23:31.460
Then all of the people around him, they put their hats back on.

387
00:23:33.610 --> 00:23:36.950
Then the knees are sort of, is looking around and like it's almost,

388
00:23:36.951 --> 00:23:40.370
it's happening at this, it's somewhere between conscious and subconscious level.

389
00:23:40.371 --> 00:23:43.310
And then he sort of just puts his hat back on.

390
00:23:44.570 --> 00:23:48.890
It's funny, it's really, really sky wasn't in order. It was not in on it.

391
00:23:49.070 --> 00:23:53.060
You clearly just was trying to, to fit in, in this weird way.

392
00:23:53.120 --> 00:23:57.680
It's interestingly though, like I never watched the TV show when I was young,

393
00:23:58.010 --> 00:24:00.890
but it's weird. Like we, uh, when I was seven, we still,

394
00:24:01.460 --> 00:24:04.970
we would say all the time like, smile, you're on candid camera.

395
00:24:05.000 --> 00:24:06.800
Even though I'd never seen the show.

396
00:24:07.190 --> 00:24:09.740
So it was like the idea of the show was like in a way,

397
00:24:09.741 --> 00:24:14.240
way bigger than the actual show. Yeah, you kind of became a meme but,

398
00:24:14.270 --> 00:24:19.270
but it was less about kind of investigating human behavior and more about vanity

399
00:24:20.661 --> 00:24:21.291
in this weird way.

400
00:24:21.291 --> 00:24:26.291
It was like this idea that you dis tiny sliver of your private life could be

401
00:24:27.410 --> 00:24:31.070
excised and then broadcast to the world. Um,

402
00:24:31.760 --> 00:24:32.900
and that idea,

403
00:24:33.140 --> 00:24:37.820
that idea would get away from Alan Font and it would go all over the world and

404
00:24:37.821 --> 00:24:42.320
then it would come right back and bite him in the butt in this really funny and

405
00:24:42.321 --> 00:24:46.990
strange way. What, what happened? Well, okay.

406
00:24:46.991 --> 00:24:51.490
It starts like this. Hi there.

407
00:24:51.520 --> 00:24:55.840
Hi. How are you? Good. Come on in. We'll start this story with this woman. Oh,

408
00:24:55.841 --> 00:24:57.990
we are now Marilyn Fun.

409
00:24:58.600 --> 00:25:01.590
<v 5>Uh, the x y for Valen Fund and we're on,</v>

410
00:25:01.690 --> 00:25:04.900
do you want me to start when we're on the plane? Okay.

411
00:25:05.300 --> 00:25:08.420
<v 0>February 3rd, 1969, New York airport.</v>

412
00:25:08.570 --> 00:25:13.340
That's Maryland funds daughter Allan Funds Daughter Juliet Fund. My Mom, my dad,

413
00:25:13.341 --> 00:25:14.780
my baby brother and I are on a flight

414
00:25:15.860 --> 00:25:20.630
<v 5>straight fly to Miami and I'm about one and a half so I don't have any personal</v>

415
00:25:20.631 --> 00:25:22.100
recollection of it, but she does,

416
00:25:22.101 --> 00:25:24.680
she knows this story because it's like a family Lord.

417
00:25:24.710 --> 00:25:27.620
So we were in first class and we were on the flight.

418
00:25:27.680 --> 00:25:32.570
Oh largely uneventful flight for one's replying on that for about the first 20

419
00:25:32.571 --> 00:25:34.220
minutes. It'd be an hour. Who knows?

420
00:25:34.460 --> 00:25:37.640
There are about a hundred miles or so off shore and you know,

421
00:25:37.641 --> 00:25:41.020
they get their meals and go to the bathroom and all of a sudden

422
00:25:42.770 --> 00:25:46.760
<v 0>a man stood up in the back of the flight end. He took out a knife</v>

423
00:25:48.650 --> 00:25:51.410
and he put it to the throat of the one of the flight attendants and he walked

424
00:25:51.411 --> 00:25:53.860
her all the way down the center island into the cock

425
00:25:55.290 --> 00:25:57.180
<v 5>passing every passenger on the flight.</v>

426
00:25:59.920 --> 00:26:03.940
<v 10>I did hear noises, which were a little bit different in the back.</v>

427
00:26:04.030 --> 00:26:06.980
That's Fred Weaver, retired eastern airlines pilots,

428
00:26:07.430 --> 00:26:12.200
<v 0>one of the flight crew and next to him. Yes sir. Copilot, Lowell Miller.</v>

429
00:26:12.260 --> 00:26:13.550
They were expecting breakfast.

430
00:26:13.600 --> 00:26:13.901
<v 10>You know,</v>

431
00:26:13.901 --> 00:26:18.160
I hear the knock on the door and I just opened the door and I turned around to

432
00:26:18.161 --> 00:26:19.090
see who it was.

433
00:26:19.280 --> 00:26:23.500
There she is a flight attendant with the hijacker behind her with a knife up

434
00:26:23.501 --> 00:26:28.120
against her throat. He was agitated saying a Cuba, Cuba.

435
00:26:28.480 --> 00:26:32.620
He also was saying that his friend had a bomb in the back of the chair.

436
00:26:36.350 --> 00:26:36.590
<v 9>[inaudible]</v>

437
00:26:36.590 --> 00:26:39.590
<v 10>I knew right then I said, oh, here we go.</v>

438
00:26:41.770 --> 00:26:43.590
<v 0>The stewardess was walking around</v>

439
00:26:44.220 --> 00:26:45.690
<v 11>talking with all the passengers,</v>

440
00:26:45.691 --> 00:26:49.680
asking them if anybody knew how to speak Spanish. That's Jim. Zack.

441
00:26:49.681 --> 00:26:52.140
He was back in coach. He was 11 years old at the time.

442
00:26:52.170 --> 00:26:54.750
I didn't think much of it until, uh,

443
00:26:55.440 --> 00:26:57.930
until the announcement came on the loudspeaker.

444
00:26:58.120 --> 00:27:00.700
<v 5>Pilot gets on and says, Ladies and Gentlemen,</v>

445
00:27:00.720 --> 00:27:04.500
<v 11>Ladies and Gentlemen, we have some gentlemen up here that want to go to Cuba.</v>

446
00:27:04.530 --> 00:27:07.020
So we're going to Ivana.

447
00:27:08.620 --> 00:27:12.160
<v 5>And then came the part of the story that I've been told was the waiting,</v>

448
00:27:12.310 --> 00:27:16.000
the frozen silent,

449
00:27:16.300 --> 00:27:18.670
staring at each other waiting portion.

450
00:27:25.740 --> 00:27:29.070
But then this one woman a few rows away,

451
00:27:29.130 --> 00:27:34.130
began to recognize my father and she began to look and look back and forth to

452
00:27:34.771 --> 00:27:38.940
other folks and point a little bit and there was a slow building of her

453
00:27:38.941 --> 00:27:39.810
certainty.

454
00:27:40.290 --> 00:27:44.640
And then all of a sudden she pulled it up and said,

455
00:27:45.240 --> 00:27:49.470
wait a second, we are not being hijacked.

456
00:27:49.500 --> 00:27:51.330
It's a candid camera stunt.

457
00:27:54.430 --> 00:27:58.360
I'm quoting him. The plane went absolutely crazy.

458
00:27:58.990 --> 00:28:01.860
Everyone started laughing. People begin cheering.

459
00:28:02.140 --> 00:28:05.030
<v 9>Oh well, look, goes here. He's pulling me out of this done</v>

460
00:28:05.060 --> 00:28:09.350
<v 5>stamping their feet and attention dripped off of the, everyone's so relieved.</v>

461
00:28:09.351 --> 00:28:12.800
People were lined up with their air sickness bags to get autographs from my

462
00:28:12.801 --> 00:28:17.030
father. Then they relaxed and through all of this,

463
00:28:17.031 --> 00:28:18.520
my dad is begging.

464
00:28:18.610 --> 00:28:21.970
<v 9>No, I know it's not me. I'm not involved.</v>

465
00:28:22.450 --> 00:28:23.950
We are being hijacked.

466
00:28:24.780 --> 00:28:26.460
<v 5>And they said, come on out.</v>

467
00:28:28.770 --> 00:28:31.980
So Alan Funt is trying to persuade people. He's not getting any purchase.

468
00:28:31.981 --> 00:28:35.190
He sees uh, a behind him.

469
00:28:35.900 --> 00:28:38.590
He sees a priest, right?

470
00:28:39.610 --> 00:28:41.800
He runs over to the priest and said, father,

471
00:28:41.801 --> 00:28:45.040
will you please help me convince these people? Tell them, this is no joke.

472
00:28:45.041 --> 00:28:49.150
This is not a stunt up maniac is for real and what is the guy say,

473
00:28:49.960 --> 00:28:54.880
you can't get me Allan. Oh No,

474
00:28:55.060 --> 00:28:55.893
you're down.

475
00:28:56.200 --> 00:28:58.840
I always wants to see a guy with a kid with a cleric with a little collar and

476
00:28:58.841 --> 00:29:02.770
everything. Oh No, you're not having fun. Right, right, right. Meanwhile,

477
00:29:02.771 --> 00:29:06.520
where is the hijack terrifying people up in the cockpit?

478
00:29:07.120 --> 00:29:11.740
He stayed in the cockpit but eventually at some point he hears this kind of

479
00:29:11.741 --> 00:29:16.420
commotion from First-class and so he does open the door and he pokes his head

480
00:29:16.421 --> 00:29:17.440
out and

481
00:29:19.550 --> 00:29:24.260
everybody begins to applaud and applaud and we're done.

482
00:29:24.350 --> 00:29:26.600
Totally sure about that last detail. It might be an embellishment,

483
00:29:26.900 --> 00:29:30.500
but what seems clear is that around this time Allen Fund

484
00:29:33.310 --> 00:29:36.690
is starting to feel kind of trap.

485
00:29:37.350 --> 00:29:42.350
He'd been so successful at bugging the backstage at mussing up the line between

486
00:29:43.270 --> 00:29:48.010
private and public and real life and Showbiz that he couldn't when he needed to,

487
00:29:48.011 --> 00:29:50.110
he couldn't reassert that clear line.

488
00:29:50.320 --> 00:29:55.320
I was worried that he was going to come up with some idea to try to mitigate the

489
00:29:55.941 --> 00:29:57.730
situation and deal with it.

490
00:29:57.760 --> 00:30:01.780
Actually what she says ended up happening was he got so frustrated that he

491
00:30:01.781 --> 00:30:05.530
decided to just deal with the hijackers himself. Yes.

492
00:30:05.830 --> 00:30:10.030
So he starts formulating a plan to grab the guy and knock him to the floor and

493
00:30:10.031 --> 00:30:13.060
my mother saying, don't you do anything? You idiot.

494
00:30:13.061 --> 00:30:16.510
I have two babies on this plane. Leave that alone. Sit down.

495
00:30:16.750 --> 00:30:18.490
So he's going to be like Zorro. Yes.

496
00:30:19.490 --> 00:30:21.950
<v 0>Apparently the flight attendants had to tell them to sit down</v>

497
00:30:22.030 --> 00:30:23.170
<v 12>like what happens now?</v>

498
00:30:23.300 --> 00:30:27.100
Will you have you took it to the point where now the plane is landing in what?

499
00:30:27.101 --> 00:30:29.590
I guess the people in the plane think is Florida.

500
00:30:29.980 --> 00:30:32.650
So you put on the front of the plane known as Cuba, Cuba. Correct.

501
00:30:32.680 --> 00:30:34.600
When we taxied into the terminal,

502
00:30:34.830 --> 00:30:38.390
<v 0>greeted as the plane is opened by Cuban military officers,</v>

503
00:30:39.920 --> 00:30:44.350
<v 12>I saw a Cuban soldier had a gun in his hand and he had bandoliers, you know,</v>

504
00:30:44.360 --> 00:30:47.460
with lots of bullets on it and they'd been circled, lear applying.

505
00:30:47.750 --> 00:30:52.310
And it seems at this point everyone on the plane from maybe the first time with

506
00:30:52.311 --> 00:30:53.144
like,

507
00:30:54.300 --> 00:30:57.930
<v 0>oh, everybody really got it. That it was a hijacking.</v>

508
00:30:58.380 --> 00:31:01.590
That was finally the reveal just really late.

509
00:31:01.990 --> 00:31:04.260
And the story goes when they're getting off the plane.

510
00:31:04.261 --> 00:31:06.810
When these Cuban soldiers are escorting them off the plane,

511
00:31:06.840 --> 00:31:11.840
he was standing at his seat and through a twisty aspect of human psychology,

512
00:31:12.870 --> 00:31:16.710
all the passengers were filing down the aisle past him.

513
00:31:16.740 --> 00:31:19.720
They began to take their feelings out on him. Huh?

514
00:31:19.860 --> 00:31:24.860
And they became angry at him and each one of them had sort of their own grab bag

515
00:31:25.321 --> 00:31:30.120
of curses for him as if he had tricked them as if he had set them up in some

516
00:31:30.121 --> 00:31:34.650
way. And the last person in that line turned to my father and said,

517
00:31:36.550 --> 00:31:38.170
smile my ass.

518
00:31:39.520 --> 00:31:40.570
<v 5>That did happen.</v>

519
00:31:43.000 --> 00:31:48.000
Smile my ass was the closing remark on no business smile,

520
00:31:49.930 --> 00:31:51.790
my ass [inaudible]

521
00:31:55.150 --> 00:32:00.150
<v 12>to me the meaning of this scene is that here's a man who he has helped create a</v>

522
00:32:03.011 --> 00:32:07.660
situation where people in some kind of peril don't know that they are in peril,

523
00:32:07.661 --> 00:32:11.830
that they've been blinded by the device that he created.

524
00:32:12.600 --> 00:32:17.600
It suggest that's the beginning of something blurry,

525
00:32:17.861 --> 00:32:19.960
which didn't use to be as much.

526
00:32:20.190 --> 00:32:23.710
<v 0>It's funny like when I hear that plane scene it's like I'm almost nostalgic for</v>

527
00:32:23.711 --> 00:32:27.550
that kind of confusion cause what we have now is like actually way more

528
00:32:27.551 --> 00:32:29.020
confusing and I think yeah,

529
00:32:29.200 --> 00:32:33.160
because we all have these cameras so we're always taking these candid pictures

530
00:32:33.161 --> 00:32:33.911
of ourselves.

531
00:32:33.911 --> 00:32:37.900
But like obviously in theory they're candid but they're not really candid

532
00:32:37.901 --> 00:32:40.430
because we've taken like four of them and the one we choose,

533
00:32:40.431 --> 00:32:44.420
we put a filter on and I think it's interesting nowadays is what Jacob Smith

534
00:32:44.421 --> 00:32:48.140
talks about as being interesting, which is that a desperate user,

535
00:32:48.141 --> 00:32:50.840
Matt Kielty again, he was sort of off of mine because we were hashing this out.

536
00:32:50.900 --> 00:32:55.900
Now what becomes fun to look at isn't looking for people and they're the faces

537
00:32:56.031 --> 00:32:57.830
they make when they find out that they're on camera.

538
00:32:58.160 --> 00:33:00.410
It's like poking and pulling apart.

539
00:33:00.860 --> 00:33:04.430
People who know that know that they know that they're on camera.

540
00:33:04.690 --> 00:33:07.940
Like what I do and I read people's Facebook pages and Twitter like Twitter is

541
00:33:07.941 --> 00:33:08.660
like I'm,

542
00:33:08.660 --> 00:33:12.470
I'm trying to figure out what they were thinking when they crafted that sentence

543
00:33:12.650 --> 00:33:15.740
and how they were trying to represent themselves and present themselves to the

544
00:33:15.741 --> 00:33:18.710
world. You're trying to figure out what part of that post is real. Yeah,

545
00:33:18.711 --> 00:33:20.300
exactly. Cool. Yeah.

546
00:33:20.830 --> 00:33:24.520
<v 12>Well what he's really saying is that is that everyone who becomes an Allan Fund</v>

547
00:33:24.580 --> 00:33:28.900
and the and the people on the plane, like the confusion is very basic.

548
00:33:29.170 --> 00:33:31.090
Like if you're going to go on Facebook,

549
00:33:31.091 --> 00:33:33.520
then you are a little bit of an Allen Fund. If you're going to go on Twitter,

550
00:33:33.521 --> 00:33:35.410
if you're going to do that, then you're producing these shows.

551
00:33:35.740 --> 00:33:38.740
Then if you're actually trying to figure out how the other people are reacting

552
00:33:38.741 --> 00:33:41.890
to you or how you read them or how they're reading you. Yeah.

553
00:33:41.891 --> 00:33:44.500
Then you're a little bit like you're stuck on the plane cause you don't know

554
00:33:44.501 --> 00:33:47.320
what's real and what's show. Yeah. In a way,

555
00:33:49.620 --> 00:33:54.620
if you split Allan Front and half as opposed the showman and the audience.

556
00:33:54.880 --> 00:33:58.720
Now everyone is in the showman and the audience. I could both part. Yeah.

557
00:33:58.930 --> 00:34:01.990
It's like, I think we're Helen fonting ourselves.

558
00:34:06.960 --> 00:34:09.770
<v 13>[inaudible] star dude smile.</v>

559
00:34:10.190 --> 00:34:12.490
You're on candid camera.

560
00:34:13.550 --> 00:34:17.630
<v 12>Enormous thanks to our producer. Lots of Nasser also co-producer, Matt Kielty,</v>

561
00:34:17.840 --> 00:34:20.390
and a special thanks to the fund family.

562
00:34:20.720 --> 00:34:24.230
They couldn't have been more accommodating and were generous. Also, Jim,

563
00:34:24.560 --> 00:34:26.910
Zack and the Eastern Airlines employee association. Yeah.

564
00:34:27.720 --> 00:34:32.720
<v 14>I just want to close by wishing our producer Lynn Levy a heartfelt thanks and</v>

565
00:34:32.731 --> 00:34:37.731
good luck as she walks down the hall to work with our colleagues at studio three

566
00:34:37.891 --> 00:34:38.940
60 we love you, Lynn.
