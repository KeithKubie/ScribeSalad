00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:25.819
Saburō Sakai is perhaps one of the most famous
Japanese air aces to emerge from WWII, credited

00:00:25.819 --> 00:00:31.619
with at least 28 aerial victories and shooting
down or severely damaging well over 60 Allied

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:37.070
aircraft, despite later in the war flying
a plane that was vastly inferior to his opponents’

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:38.070
planes.

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:43.920
Saburō Sakai was born one of seven children
in a poor farming family in 1916 just outside

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:45.940
of the city of Saga in Japan.

00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:49.810
Despite his limited upbringing, Sakai was
reportedly very studious and was considered

00:00:49.810 --> 00:00:53.960
one of the best students at his school; so
much so that his uncle paid for him to come

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:57.270
to Tokyo to study there when he was 12 years
old.

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:01.970
However, despite his best efforts, Sakai was
unable to keep up with his peers in Tokyo

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:04.559
and after two years, his uncle sent him back
home.

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:09.630
It’s stated that on this fateful train journey
home, Sakai saw a poster advertising recruitment

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:15.109
for the Japanese Imperial Navy; two years
later when Sakai turned 16, he enlisted and

00:01:15.109 --> 00:01:16.450
began his training.

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:20.929
Sakai quickly rose through the ranks of the
Imperial Navy serving aboard two Japanese

00:01:20.929 --> 00:01:25.079
battleships and eventually earning the rank
of Petty Officer Third Class.

00:01:25.079 --> 00:01:29.549
In 1937, he applied for pilot training school,
from which he graduated at the top of his

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:35.920
class of 70, of which only 25 managed to successfully
complete the required course of training in

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:37.689
a satisfactory manner.

00:01:37.689 --> 00:01:42.080
For his performance, Sakai was given yet another
promotion, this time to the rank of Petty

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:47.439
Officer Second Class and a silver watch, presented
to him personally by the Emperor.

00:01:47.439 --> 00:01:52.090
It’s from this point on that Sakai story
gets interesting.

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:58.420
Prior to WWII, Sakai flew several combat missions
during the Second Sino-Japanese War and it’s

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:02.819
noted that during his first ever mission,
he annoyed his commanding officer by using

00:02:02.819 --> 00:02:06.619
all of his ammunition to shoot down a single
plane.

00:02:06.619 --> 00:02:10.030
Something he made up for a short while later
when the airfield he was stationed at was

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:12.690
bombed by the Chinese in 1939.

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:18.130
According to historical consultant, Mark Barber,
despite being injured by the explosion, Sakai:

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:22.330
“sprinted through burning aircraft to find
an undamaged fighter before taking to the

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:24.760
skies to chase the fleeing bombers.”

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:29.070
Sakai was unable to shoot down the bomber
that had attacked his airfield, but his actions

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:31.330
didn’t go unnoticed by his superiors.

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:34.810
Although they did not give him any sort of
medal for his heroism, a theme that would

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:39.940
be consistent throughout Sakai’s impressive
career, he was promoted to Petty Officer First

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:40.940
Class.

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:45.660
As WWII heated up, Sakai’s skills as a pilot
became more and more apparent and, as mentioned,

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:51.900
he’s credited with downing over 60 Allied
aircraft, including one dogfight in 1942 where

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:58.680
Sakai shot down a confirmed three aircraft
in the span of a mere 15 seconds.

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:00.790
That said, Sakai didn’t always get his target.

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:06.200
For example, in 1942, Sakai tried and failed
to shoot down a B-26 near the coast of New

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:07.400
Guinea.

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:09.090
Why is this significant?

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:13.240
Future U.S. President Lyndon B. Johnson was
aboard that B-26.

00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:18.800
Though Sakai was indeed unflinching in his
sense of duty, he was prone to bouts of disobedience

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:20.790
which often bordered on the hilarious.

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:25.620
For example, he would openly smoke comically
huge, illegally obtained cigars in front of

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:30.610
his superiors and once fired his pistol at
the feet of an officer administering a beating

00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:31.870
to one of his wingmen.

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:35.360
However, the incident that got Sakai in the
most hot water was when he, along with two

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:39.900
of his wingmen, flew over the Port Moreseby
Airfield in their Zeroes after an aerial skirmish

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:43.570
and did a number of loop the loops just to
annoy the Allies.

00:03:43.570 --> 00:03:48.260
A few hours later, a bomber flew over Sakai’s
base and dropped a note thanking the Japanese

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:52.430
for their “wonderful display of acrobatics”
and informing them that the next time they

00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:56.400
tried a stunt like that they’d have a “warm
welcome” waiting for them.

00:03:56.400 --> 00:04:00.140
Sakai’s most famous exploit came during
that same year when he was shot in the face

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:03.400
by an enemy plane he was in the process of
trying to shoot down.

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:08.040
The shot destroyed the vision in Sakai’s
right eye and crippled the entire left side

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:09.040
of his body.

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:13.770
Disoriented from the wound, Sakai lost control
of his plane which went into a steep dive.

00:04:13.770 --> 00:04:17.610
In a stroke of luck, the dive actually ended
up helping him by extinguishing the flames

00:04:17.610 --> 00:04:19.810
threatening to consume the cockpit.

00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:23.540
Using his one good arm, Sakai was able to
clean away some of the blood from his face

00:04:23.540 --> 00:04:25.340
using his fetching silk scarf.

00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:29.350
When asked to later recall that day, Sakai
notes that his first thought was that he wanted

00:04:29.350 --> 00:04:33.850
to die taking at least one enemy with him
and he immediately began looking for an Allied

00:04:33.850 --> 00:04:36.500
ship into which he could crash his damaged
plane.

00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:40.540
Despite this, Sakai would later become one
of the most critical opponents of the controversial

00:04:40.540 --> 00:04:41.540
Kamikaze technique.

00:04:41.540 --> 00:04:42.540
(See: How Were Kamikaze Pilots Chosen?)

00:04:42.540 --> 00:04:44.910
In the end, once he found his plane was still
airworthy, he changed his mind and managed

00:04:44.910 --> 00:04:46.900
to make it back to base, barely.

00:04:46.900 --> 00:04:50.960
What makes this trip back even more remarkable
was that Sakai famously flew almost the entire

00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:54.830
1040 kilometre journey back to base UPSIDE
DOWN to stop the blood from his wounds getting

00:04:54.830 --> 00:04:57.270
into his good eye and memorably refused medical
treatment until he made his mission report.

00:04:57.270 --> 00:05:00.720
Despite losing the sight in his right eye,
he did eventually return to the skies towards

00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:05.030
the end of the war and due to his status as
one Japan’s top flying aces, there were

00:05:05.030 --> 00:05:09.020
literal fights between younger pilots about
who would be his wingman.

00:05:09.020 --> 00:05:12.930
In later interviews, Sakai maintained that
the loss of his eye never affected his flying

00:05:12.930 --> 00:05:17.840
ability, something he proved in a dogfight
in 1944 that vaulted him from flying ace,

00:05:17.840 --> 00:05:19.690
to legend.

00:05:19.690 --> 00:05:24.240
At this time, he was ambushed by no less than
15 Allied Hellcats near Iwo Jima.

00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:29.610
In a dogfight that lasted some 20 minutes,
Sakai wasn’t hit by a single enemy round,

00:05:29.610 --> 00:05:33.770
despite thousands of rounds being shot at
him and his craft being vastly inferior to

00:05:33.770 --> 00:05:35.880
those he was up against at this point in the
war.

00:05:35.880 --> 00:05:39.960
In fact, the combination of the Japanese pilots
being largely outnumbered and in outdated

00:05:39.960 --> 00:05:43.390
planes near the end of the war resulted in
the Battle of the Philippine Sea in June of

00:05:43.390 --> 00:05:47.830
1944 getting nicknamed “The Great Marianas
Turkey Shoot” by the Allies.

00:05:47.830 --> 00:05:53.030
Further, two years before this, in June of
1942, Japan lost more airmen in a single day

00:05:53.030 --> 00:05:56.860
than they had managed to train in an entire
year just before the war.

00:05:56.860 --> 00:05:59.820
This might have you wondering how Sakai survived
the fight.

00:05:59.820 --> 00:06:03.460
He simply dodged bullets the best he could
while making sure the battle drifted towards

00:06:03.460 --> 00:06:07.970
Iwo Jima, where anti-aircraft guns could do
what he could not in that situation.

00:06:07.970 --> 00:06:11.550
It worked and, once in range of the guns,
the Hellcats were driven off.

00:06:11.550 --> 00:06:15.960
After the war, Sakai became a Buddhist and
vowed to never harm another living thing.

00:06:15.960 --> 00:06:19.610
He also went on to become good friends with
some of the men he’d previously called his

00:06:19.610 --> 00:06:23.360
enemy, including Harold Jones, the man who
fired the round that cost him the sight in

00:06:23.360 --> 00:06:28.370
his eye, as well as Paul Tibbets, the pilot
of the plane that dropped the atomic bomb

00:06:28.370 --> 00:06:29.370
on Hiroshima.

00:06:29.370 --> 00:06:33.910
Saburō Sakai died in 2000 at the age of 84
while attending a formal dinner at a U.S.

00:06:33.910 --> 00:06:36.610
Navy airbase, in which Sakai was a guest of
honour.

00:06:36.610 --> 00:06:40.570
As the New York Times noted shortly after
his death, Sakai “suffered a heart attack

00:06:40.570 --> 00:06:46.960
as he leaned across the table to shake hands
with an American; he died later in a hospital.”

00:06:46.960 --> 00:06:50.760
The only medal Sakai was ever awarded in his
life actually came from the American military

00:06:50.760 --> 00:06:54.050
for defeating two US pilots… in a golf tournament.

00:06:54.050 --> 00:06:55.723
Sakai eventually reached the rank of Sub-lieutenant,
making him one of only a handful of Japanese

00:06:55.723 --> 00:06:56.723
men to become officers after starting out
as enlisted men.

00:06:56.723 --> 00:06:57.723
Ever the rebel, Sakai often kept his lunch
in his standard issue reconnaissance bag in

00:06:57.723 --> 00:06:58.723
case he got hungry during flights.

00:06:58.723 --> 00:07:00.040
When Sakai learned about the dropping of the
Atomic bomb and Japan’s surrender, he took

00:07:00.040 --> 00:07:03.669
to the skies and shot down a B-29 bomber in
retaliation.

00:07:03.669 --> 00:07:22.600
This is believed to be the last Allied plane
shot down by Japanese forces during WWII.
