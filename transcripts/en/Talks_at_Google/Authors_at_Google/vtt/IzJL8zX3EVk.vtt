00:00:05.874 --> 00:00:07.290
THERON TINGSTAD:
Hello, everybody.

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:08.690
Welcome to Talks at Google.

00:00:08.690 --> 00:00:11.120
We've got an incredible
speaker today.

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:14.060
I'd like to introduce
Captain David Marquet.

00:00:14.060 --> 00:00:16.850
Captain Marquet is
best known for his work

00:00:16.850 --> 00:00:19.760
that he did with
the USS Santa Fe,

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:22.940
where he took that nuclear
powered submarine from worst

00:00:22.940 --> 00:00:23.810
to first.

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:27.170
And it ended up generating
the most leaders

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:30.320
that the Navy has ever seen
out of the submarine program.

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:32.210
He's going to share
some of his insights

00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:35.690
today of what he has learned
over his time in the Navy.

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:39.350
How he has an alternative
take on leadership.

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:42.800
And he shares these
insights with companies

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:44.054
around the world.

00:00:44.054 --> 00:00:45.470
And I think we're
very lucky today

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:46.594
to have him here at Google.

00:00:49.085 --> 00:00:51.620
He's documented a
lot of his story

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:54.620
and his insights in the
book, "Turn the Ship Around--

00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:57.310
A True Story of Turning
Followers into Leaders."

00:00:57.310 --> 00:00:58.977
So without further
ado, Captain Marquet.

00:00:58.977 --> 00:01:00.018
DAVID MARQUET: Thank you.

00:01:00.018 --> 00:01:00.786
Thank you.

00:01:00.786 --> 00:01:01.958
[APPLAUSE]

00:01:01.958 --> 00:01:03.131
Thanks!

00:01:03.131 --> 00:01:06.550
It's great to be here.

00:01:06.550 --> 00:01:08.230
So thanks a lot,
thanks for having me.

00:01:08.230 --> 00:01:13.170
Yeah, we advertise the
book on AdWords a lot.

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:15.070
Sell a bunch.

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:19.644
So what does having to run a
nuclear submarine have anything

00:01:19.644 --> 00:01:21.060
to do with working
here at Google?

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:23.972
Well, hopefully by the
end of this session,

00:01:23.972 --> 00:01:25.180
you'll have some connections.

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:28.060
What I want to talk today about
are seven myths of leadership,

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:29.770
seven things that
I thought I was

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:32.650
dead sure I knew about
leadership, which I now think

00:01:32.650 --> 00:01:35.740
are actually unhelpful
or just basically wrong.

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:38.950
So here we are with the
crew on the submarine.

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:41.050
Submarines spend most of
their time underwater.

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:43.540
And even when the submarine is
on the surface, most of it's

00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:44.710
underwater, like an iceberg.

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:46.900
But here, the
submarine's in dry dock.

00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:51.146
There's a crew of about 135,
the average age is 27 years old.

00:01:51.146 --> 00:01:53.020
So it's probably not
much different than what

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:54.610
we have here.

00:01:54.610 --> 00:01:55.660
These are the officers.

00:01:55.660 --> 00:01:57.630
These are the only guys
with college degrees.

00:01:57.630 --> 00:01:59.800
Then the technicians,
the blue shirts,

00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:01.572
are the guys who
do all the work.

00:02:01.572 --> 00:02:03.280
And then over here,
these are the chiefs,

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:04.450
so they've been technicians.

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:06.074
They did a good job,
they got promoted.

00:02:06.074 --> 00:02:08.115
They've been in the
Navy for 6, 8, 10 years.

00:02:08.115 --> 00:02:09.490
We promote them,
we let them wear

00:02:09.490 --> 00:02:13.270
the same brown, highly
fashionable brown uniform

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:14.980
that the officers wear.

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:16.540
And we turn them into leaders.

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:19.150
We say they're leaders.

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:21.070
So there's not a lot
of room on a submarine,

00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:22.630
because we're going to
put all these people

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:24.546
inside the submarine and
most of the submarine

00:02:24.546 --> 00:02:27.110
is taken up by equipment.

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:29.210
So there's not a lot
of exercise space.

00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:31.030
So for example, one
of the things we do

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:32.750
is we take a SEAL
team, and we have

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:34.750
to deliver them to wherever
they're going to do.

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:37.810
Any SEALs out here,
Special Forces people?

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:39.400
I know I've got at
least one Marine.

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:45.960
OK, so these SEALs are
super fit individuals.

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:48.070
They in the gym all the time.

00:02:48.070 --> 00:02:49.840
But there's no gym
on a submarine,

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:52.420
so their bodies deteriorate
every passing day.

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:54.879
So the Navy says, you can't
bring these SEALs on board

00:02:54.879 --> 00:02:56.920
until the very last minute,
because the submarine

00:02:56.920 --> 00:03:01.420
is a toxic environment for
these elite individuals,

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:02.495
these elite athletes.

00:03:02.495 --> 00:03:04.120
Now this was always
troublesome for me,

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:07.000
because we'd live
there for 180 days.

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:10.940
No one cared about that!

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:11.920
So here's what happens.

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:13.930
They say, we've got to
pick up a SEAL team.

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:17.060
So we take the submarine
away from the shoreline.

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:18.850
We surface it, which
we don't like to do.

00:03:18.850 --> 00:03:20.920
It puts us in a
vulnerable position.

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:24.421
And we want to be there as
short a time as possible.

00:03:24.421 --> 00:03:26.420
Then the helicopter shows
up with the SEAL team.

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:28.510
They're going to
come down this rope.

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:31.330
These guys in orange, this
is the submarine crew.

00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:36.034
I'm up here, in charge
of this deal, right?

00:03:36.034 --> 00:03:38.200
And then we've got to find
some young guy to go back

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:40.630
here and hold on to this rope.

00:03:40.630 --> 00:03:43.750
Because it's important to
tether the rope at the bottom.

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:45.500
SEAL team comes
down one at a time.

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:49.240
Now this young man, in my
case there were all men.

00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:51.860
We now have women on submarines,
which I think is great.

00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:54.580
But this young man has got to
make a bunch of snap decisions.

00:03:54.580 --> 00:03:56.930
Because we're moving together.

00:03:56.930 --> 00:04:00.417
And if the helicopter hovers
and it starts moving away,

00:04:00.417 --> 00:04:02.500
do I let go of the rope,
do I hold on to the rope.

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:05.030
A wave comes, could
knock someone overboard.

00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:07.280
And this person is going to
make a bunch of decisions.

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:09.750
They've got a helicopter
hovering right over their head.

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:11.110
[MAKING HELICOPTER SOUNDS]

00:04:11.110 --> 00:04:13.475
Even if they had time,
no one can hear him.

00:04:13.475 --> 00:04:14.850
What do you want
me to do about--

00:04:14.850 --> 00:04:16.920
[MAKING HELICOPTER SOUNDS]

00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:19.220
And he couldn't
hear the response.

00:04:19.220 --> 00:04:21.190
So for this to be
successful, we need

00:04:21.190 --> 00:04:23.470
to train a team
that needs to know

00:04:23.470 --> 00:04:28.060
what they need to do and make
decisions without being told.

00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:30.530
Without being told
and oh, by the way,

00:04:30.530 --> 00:04:34.270
this is my view from
up there on the bridge.

00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:37.000
I can't even see
what's going on.

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:43.060
And we think oh, when I get
into the moment of crisis,

00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:46.254
when the disruption comes, we're
going to really want to win,

00:04:46.254 --> 00:04:47.920
and we're going to
win because we really

00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:50.500
want to win has nothing
to do with winning.

00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:52.450
It's are you willing
to do the hard work

00:04:52.450 --> 00:04:54.280
before you get to here.

00:04:54.280 --> 00:04:57.070
Have you created a team
that when this happens,

00:04:57.070 --> 00:04:58.930
you don't need to
tell them what to do.

00:04:58.930 --> 00:05:02.270
That's going to determine
success in this event.

00:05:02.270 --> 00:05:06.970
But this picture I think is
exactly relevant for you guys.

00:05:06.970 --> 00:05:10.246
Exactly relevant, because you
can walk down the hallway,

00:05:10.246 --> 00:05:11.620
you can stand
behind an engineer,

00:05:11.620 --> 00:05:14.210
you can stand behind one of
the people, one of the sales

00:05:14.210 --> 00:05:15.460
people.

00:05:15.460 --> 00:05:18.460
And you can watch them, move
the mouse right, move it left,

00:05:18.460 --> 00:05:22.320
click enter, closed bracket.

00:05:22.320 --> 00:05:24.730
We get a sense, oh,
I can control it.

00:05:24.730 --> 00:05:26.140
But for the most
important things

00:05:26.140 --> 00:05:28.140
that you all bring to
work with every day, which

00:05:28.140 --> 00:05:33.490
is your creativity and your
passion, it's just like this.

00:05:33.490 --> 00:05:34.250
It's invisible.

00:05:34.250 --> 00:05:36.583
And the degree to which we
go out there and try and tell

00:05:36.583 --> 00:05:39.280
people what to do, we're
just throwing cold water

00:05:39.280 --> 00:05:42.070
on that spark that comes
inside of every human being

00:05:42.070 --> 00:05:42.610
to do this.

00:05:42.610 --> 00:05:45.100
We're throwing cold
water on their passion.

00:05:45.100 --> 00:05:46.660
This is a hard lesson
that I learned.

00:05:46.660 --> 00:05:48.580
Because for me,
leadership was all

00:05:48.580 --> 00:05:52.600
about telling people what
to do for a long time.

00:05:52.600 --> 00:05:55.970
Seven myths of leadership,
what is leadership?

00:05:55.970 --> 00:06:00.414
Now I hope to have this be
a little bit interactive.

00:06:00.414 --> 00:06:02.830
I know we're broadcasting it,
so everyone can participate,

00:06:02.830 --> 00:06:05.510
including the remote people.

00:06:05.510 --> 00:06:06.980
Hopefully you have phones.

00:06:09.680 --> 00:06:15.440
And we're going to go to this
website called P-O-L-L-E-V.

00:06:15.440 --> 00:06:17.960
And I've got about half a
dozen of these throughout

00:06:17.960 --> 00:06:21.950
the presentation, just to get
a sense of what we all think

00:06:21.950 --> 00:06:25.680
here, or any web enabled device
here, like the computers.

00:06:25.680 --> 00:06:27.530
So go ahead and type this in.

00:06:27.530 --> 00:06:30.231
P-O-L-L-E-V.com/intent.

00:06:30.231 --> 00:06:32.105
And I'm going to bring
up the first question.

00:06:36.930 --> 00:06:38.319
Here's a warm up question.

00:06:38.319 --> 00:06:39.860
All right, good,
we're getting there.

00:06:39.860 --> 00:06:44.225
OK, so you see it right up
here, P-O-L-L-E-V.com/intent.

00:06:44.225 --> 00:06:45.100
What's your hometown?

00:06:45.100 --> 00:06:46.308
What city did you grow up in?

00:06:49.088 --> 00:06:49.588
Good.

00:06:55.890 --> 00:06:58.080
Good, good, good.

00:06:58.080 --> 00:07:02.100
I figured you guys at Google
would figure this out.

00:07:02.100 --> 00:07:03.820
[LAUGHTER]

00:07:03.820 --> 00:07:07.480
I have some audiences
that need a little help.

00:07:07.480 --> 00:07:10.220
Let's see.

00:07:10.220 --> 00:07:11.190
I'm guess Anarbor.

00:07:11.190 --> 00:07:12.360
Don't put a space in it.

00:07:12.360 --> 00:07:16.940
It treats every word
like a separate response.

00:07:16.940 --> 00:07:19.530
Now we're building a word
cloud, which I know you've seen.

00:07:19.530 --> 00:07:22.317
The idea is the more people type
in the same word, the bigger

00:07:22.317 --> 00:07:23.400
that particular word gets.

00:07:23.400 --> 00:07:27.900
So we see Detroit, which makes
sense, I'm here in Anarbor.

00:07:27.900 --> 00:07:32.370
Anarbor, Chicago, Dunes,
Ogden, Boston, Burlington.

00:07:32.370 --> 00:07:33.150
Da Nang, I saw.

00:07:33.150 --> 00:07:35.655
Johannesberg,
Pittsburgh, Lambertville.

00:07:35.655 --> 00:07:36.780
All right, so that's great.

00:07:36.780 --> 00:07:37.220
We got that.

00:07:37.220 --> 00:07:38.386
That's our warm up question.

00:07:38.386 --> 00:07:41.640
Now I'm going to ask you
a very serious question,

00:07:41.640 --> 00:07:42.930
serious question.

00:07:42.930 --> 00:07:46.480
And I'd like you to take a stand
here, one side or the other.

00:07:46.480 --> 00:07:51.600
If you had to, which
is, business value

00:07:51.600 --> 00:07:53.680
here at Google,
more business value

00:07:53.680 --> 00:07:56.664
be created either A, people
independently thinking, or B,

00:07:56.664 --> 00:07:58.080
better at doing
what they're told.

00:08:00.890 --> 00:08:02.700
So we're gonna get a
bunch of results here

00:08:02.700 --> 00:08:05.780
and then we'll go ahead
and expose the results.

00:08:05.780 --> 00:08:06.280
OK.

00:08:09.160 --> 00:08:11.690
You guys are pretty far over
on the displaying independent

00:08:11.690 --> 00:08:12.190
thinking.

00:08:12.190 --> 00:08:14.606
That's good, because that's
what this whole talk is about.

00:08:14.606 --> 00:08:19.090
Creating a team that displays
independent thinking.

00:08:19.090 --> 00:08:22.990
Now it didn't used
to be like this.

00:08:22.990 --> 00:08:26.700
For your parents, grandparents,
great, great grandparents,

00:08:26.700 --> 00:08:29.740
work used to look like this for
the last several hundred years

00:08:29.740 --> 00:08:31.330
of our human existence.

00:08:31.330 --> 00:08:33.460
We've come through this
thing called the Industrial

00:08:33.460 --> 00:08:34.539
Revolution.

00:08:34.539 --> 00:08:36.669
And work during the
Industrial Revolution

00:08:36.669 --> 00:08:40.280
was what we called for
most people neck down.

00:08:40.280 --> 00:08:42.580
It's what I do with my hands.

00:08:42.580 --> 00:08:45.770
This is a radio factory
outside of Philadelphia

00:08:45.770 --> 00:08:47.116
just before World War II.

00:08:47.116 --> 00:08:48.490
These people are
hired for what's

00:08:48.490 --> 00:08:52.030
happening here with their hands,
not what's happening up here.

00:08:52.030 --> 00:08:53.740
One person in the
back of the factory

00:08:53.740 --> 00:08:56.320
has done the thinking and the
deciding for these people,

00:08:56.320 --> 00:09:00.010
and these people are
all in the doing part.

00:09:00.010 --> 00:09:05.440
And it turns out that this
legacy of work is an anchor.

00:09:05.440 --> 00:09:07.810
Because the language
and the structure

00:09:07.810 --> 00:09:10.270
that we use for
our organizations

00:09:10.270 --> 00:09:14.920
still, in many ways,
hearken back to this legacy.

00:09:14.920 --> 00:09:20.145
So when we say we come
to work and do our jobs,

00:09:20.145 --> 00:09:21.520
like the fact that
we even say we

00:09:21.520 --> 00:09:23.561
come to work and do our
jobs, because most of you

00:09:23.561 --> 00:09:25.090
actually don't do anything.

00:09:25.090 --> 00:09:28.180
Like you think your
jobs, I would say, right?

00:09:28.180 --> 00:09:30.130
But we don't say, because
that sounds weird.

00:09:30.130 --> 00:09:34.570
But that's because this has
influenced the way we talk.

00:09:34.570 --> 00:09:38.800
And so that's influencing
our behaviors.

00:09:38.800 --> 00:09:40.720
And schools were
designed to create

00:09:40.720 --> 00:09:42.554
people who were
comfortable going

00:09:42.554 --> 00:09:43.720
into environments like that.

00:09:43.720 --> 00:09:46.660
So the schools were about
conformity and compliance.

00:09:46.660 --> 00:09:51.220
Now this group of sad people is
the 1977 Concord-Carlisle High

00:09:51.220 --> 00:09:53.680
School math team.

00:09:53.680 --> 00:09:55.090
And this is me.

00:09:55.090 --> 00:09:56.560
I was a mathlete.

00:09:56.560 --> 00:09:59.320
[LAUGHTER]

00:09:59.320 --> 00:10:00.777
Yeah, I have some weird--

00:10:00.777 --> 00:10:02.110
I can't even look at the camera.

00:10:02.110 --> 00:10:06.430
I have weird social issues.

00:10:06.430 --> 00:10:09.460
Any mathletes out there?

00:10:09.460 --> 00:10:10.030
Yes?

00:10:10.030 --> 00:10:10.750
All right!

00:10:10.750 --> 00:10:12.610
Thanks for-- good!

00:10:12.610 --> 00:10:14.600
Yes!

00:10:14.600 --> 00:10:19.480
I knew Google would have at
least a couple brave people.

00:10:19.480 --> 00:10:21.430
So I was in the math
team and the chess team

00:10:21.430 --> 00:10:23.057
and I was in the computer club.

00:10:23.057 --> 00:10:25.390
And my high school was one
of a few public high schools.

00:10:25.390 --> 00:10:28.720
We got our computers
back in 1976.

00:10:28.720 --> 00:10:30.610
It was this big machine.

00:10:30.610 --> 00:10:34.180
And we fed in these
tapes, this pink tape

00:10:34.180 --> 00:10:36.080
that was punched holes in it.

00:10:36.080 --> 00:10:37.840
And we had the computer
do amazing things,

00:10:37.840 --> 00:10:40.990
like count to 10 and
calculate square roots.

00:10:40.990 --> 00:10:43.830
And you'd feed the
tape in in the evening,

00:10:43.830 --> 00:10:44.920
and you'd push play.

00:10:44.920 --> 00:10:45.810
You'd watch it--

00:10:45.810 --> 00:10:46.750
[MAKING WORKING SOUND]

00:10:46.750 --> 00:10:48.550
And then you'd go home and you'd
come back the next morning,

00:10:48.550 --> 00:10:50.440
and find like it
hung two minutes

00:10:50.440 --> 00:10:52.920
after you left and you'd
have to start over again.

00:10:52.920 --> 00:10:56.860
And that was me in high school.

00:10:56.860 --> 00:11:00.280
And it was the 70s, and
we were in this tough time

00:11:00.280 --> 00:11:01.570
in the country.

00:11:01.570 --> 00:11:04.390
I felt I wanted to do
something about that.

00:11:04.390 --> 00:11:08.139
If you're a geeky
introverted kid, so for me

00:11:08.139 --> 00:11:09.430
I wanted to go in the military.

00:11:09.430 --> 00:11:11.010
I had no military
in my family, but I

00:11:11.010 --> 00:11:15.280
was like, I'm going to
be a submarine commander.

00:11:15.280 --> 00:11:15.880
Like, why?

00:11:15.880 --> 00:11:16.421
I don't know.

00:11:16.421 --> 00:11:18.310
It popped in my head.

00:11:18.310 --> 00:11:20.380
I think it was because
if you're an introvert

00:11:20.380 --> 00:11:21.838
and you want to go
in the military,

00:11:21.838 --> 00:11:23.960
it's where you can hide.

00:11:23.960 --> 00:11:26.181
So I set myself down that path.

00:11:26.181 --> 00:11:26.930
And you know what?

00:11:26.930 --> 00:11:29.210
It actually happened.

00:11:29.210 --> 00:11:31.120
So here's my book.

00:11:31.120 --> 00:11:35.570
Now remember, as a geek, I
took my studies very seriously.

00:11:35.570 --> 00:11:37.990
Here's my leadership book
from the United States Naval

00:11:37.990 --> 00:11:38.580
Academy.

00:11:38.580 --> 00:11:40.060
Here is what it says.

00:11:40.060 --> 00:11:42.610
Leadership can be defined as
directing the thoughts, plans,

00:11:42.610 --> 00:11:45.069
and actions of others, so
as to obtain and command

00:11:45.069 --> 00:11:47.110
their obedience, their
confidence, their respect,

00:11:47.110 --> 00:11:50.440
and their loyal cooperation.

00:11:50.440 --> 00:11:52.584
Now what do you think of that?

00:11:52.584 --> 00:11:54.250
I want you to just
talk to your neighbor

00:11:54.250 --> 00:11:55.814
for 30 seconds about this.

00:11:55.814 --> 00:11:57.730
How would it feel to
work in this environment.

00:11:57.730 --> 00:11:58.645
Then we're gonna have
a short conversation.

00:11:58.645 --> 00:12:00.070
Then we're gonna keep going.

00:12:00.070 --> 00:12:02.270
Go.

00:12:02.270 --> 00:12:04.025
OK, five, four, three, two, one.

00:12:04.025 --> 00:12:05.650
Does anyone have any
words that kind of

00:12:05.650 --> 00:12:07.600
come to mind to describe this?

00:12:07.600 --> 00:12:09.136
I'll repeat them.

00:12:09.136 --> 00:12:11.530
Just shout them out.

00:12:11.530 --> 00:12:13.750
Micromanage, good.

00:12:13.750 --> 00:12:15.410
Rigid.

00:12:15.410 --> 00:12:17.510
Prescriptive.

00:12:17.510 --> 00:12:20.170
Dead weight loss.

00:12:20.170 --> 00:12:21.130
Intimidating.

00:12:21.130 --> 00:12:23.760
Tell me more about intimidating.

00:12:23.760 --> 00:12:25.271
Scary, don't mess up, right.

00:12:25.271 --> 00:12:26.520
It's a fear based environment.

00:12:26.520 --> 00:12:28.900
Very good, what else?

00:12:28.900 --> 00:12:31.360
So this is predicated
on the assumption

00:12:31.360 --> 00:12:34.420
that first of all, the
leader knows all the answers.

00:12:34.420 --> 00:12:38.736
And your job is just to show
up and do what you're told.

00:12:38.736 --> 00:12:40.360
Then we say, well
where's your passion?

00:12:40.360 --> 00:12:43.870
Where's your engagement?

00:12:43.870 --> 00:12:47.590
Do you guys do these
employee engagement surveys?

00:12:47.590 --> 00:12:48.090
You do?

00:12:48.090 --> 00:12:48.920
Yeah, OK.

00:12:51.700 --> 00:12:53.590
I'm not engaged.

00:12:53.590 --> 00:12:56.620
You made me feel this way!

00:12:56.620 --> 00:12:57.880
So we're going to fix this.

00:12:57.880 --> 00:12:59.620
I call it know all,
tell all leadership.

00:12:59.620 --> 00:13:01.870
And one of the questions
that I'm gonna leave you with

00:13:01.870 --> 00:13:04.000
is where here in
this quadrant do you

00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:06.280
want to operate as a leader.

00:13:06.280 --> 00:13:07.960
I thought it was
know all, tell all.

00:13:07.960 --> 00:13:10.085
Leader knows all the answers,
gives all the orders.

00:13:10.085 --> 00:13:13.360
That was the best place
you could be as a leader.

00:13:13.360 --> 00:13:16.690
I got ordered to be the
captain of the USS Olympia

00:13:16.690 --> 00:13:18.820
17 years after I graduated
from the Naval Academy.

00:13:18.820 --> 00:13:20.802
I was super excited about it.

00:13:20.802 --> 00:13:22.760
The Navy took me out of
my job and they sent me

00:13:22.760 --> 00:13:26.010
to school for 12 months so I
could learn every single detail

00:13:26.010 --> 00:13:27.275
of this ship.

00:13:27.275 --> 00:13:30.050
It'd be like having
the CEO come in here

00:13:30.050 --> 00:13:35.235
and stand behind your
desk and fix your code.

00:13:35.235 --> 00:13:35.735
Freaky.

00:13:39.380 --> 00:13:42.970
Anyway, there was another
submarine, the USS Santa Fe.

00:13:42.970 --> 00:13:45.830
And the Santa Fe was
the Enron of submarines.

00:13:45.830 --> 00:13:49.240
The Santa Fe was a
submarine where you

00:13:49.240 --> 00:13:50.979
see that picture of sailors?

00:13:50.979 --> 00:13:53.270
Every year, a quarter of them
come and a quarter leave.

00:13:53.270 --> 00:13:55.580
And then when they leave,
so that's about 35 people,

00:13:55.580 --> 00:13:57.530
they say, hey, how was
your Navy experience?

00:13:57.530 --> 00:13:59.180
Would you like to stay in?

00:13:59.180 --> 00:14:01.010
Three of them said yes.

00:14:01.010 --> 00:14:02.987
That's how bad it was.

00:14:02.987 --> 00:14:04.820
And the captain on the
Santa Fe was supposed

00:14:04.820 --> 00:14:06.028
to be there for another year.

00:14:06.028 --> 00:14:08.120
So we were all like
oh, who's gonna

00:14:08.120 --> 00:14:10.984
get the poor job of being
the Santa Fe's captain.

00:14:10.984 --> 00:14:12.900
Because it was a year
ahead of time and that's

00:14:12.900 --> 00:14:13.940
when the Navy
announced the captain.

00:14:13.940 --> 00:14:14.870
But you know what?

00:14:14.870 --> 00:14:17.150
He quit early, and
they said well,

00:14:17.150 --> 00:14:20.170
we can't have a sumbarine
without a captain, so

00:14:20.170 --> 00:14:23.990
Marquet, Santa Fe.

00:14:23.990 --> 00:14:27.830
That was my oh, sugar moment.

00:14:27.830 --> 00:14:31.802
Because now I'm about
to be a know not leader.

00:14:31.802 --> 00:14:34.260
Because the problem wasn't the
bad morale and [INAUDIBLE]..

00:14:34.260 --> 00:14:37.580
The problem was the Santa Fe was
a totally different submarine,

00:14:37.580 --> 00:14:41.220
one of the newest
submarines in the fleet.

00:14:41.220 --> 00:14:43.370
So my question here is.

00:14:48.280 --> 00:14:50.860
Because I'm going to
take over a broken team.

00:14:50.860 --> 00:14:53.620
And my question is, and
this is quoting some work

00:14:53.620 --> 00:14:55.210
that you guys have
done here at Google

00:14:55.210 --> 00:14:58.540
is, what's the most
important determinant of team

00:14:58.540 --> 00:14:59.170
performance?

00:14:59.170 --> 00:15:01.460
Who's on the team,
what positions

00:15:01.460 --> 00:15:05.300
they're in, or how
the team interacts.

00:15:05.300 --> 00:15:09.310
So let's see if you guys read
your own, eat your own dog

00:15:09.310 --> 00:15:10.274
food on this one.

00:15:13.120 --> 00:15:15.460
Yes, very good.

00:15:15.460 --> 00:15:16.450
Exactly.

00:15:16.450 --> 00:15:18.880
And it turned out for me,
I didn't know any of this.

00:15:18.880 --> 00:15:21.400
Because Google wasn't
even invented then.

00:15:21.400 --> 00:15:24.910
But I couldn't control
who came to the ship.

00:15:24.910 --> 00:15:26.497
The Navy decided who
came to the ship.

00:15:26.497 --> 00:15:28.330
And I couldn't put
change to the provisions.

00:15:28.330 --> 00:15:30.940
The only thing I could
play with was basically

00:15:30.940 --> 00:15:32.980
how we talked about
it to each other.

00:15:32.980 --> 00:15:34.690
That was the only
variable I had.

00:15:34.690 --> 00:15:36.820
And it turned out, just by
luck, that it turned out

00:15:36.820 --> 00:15:38.536
to be the most important one.

00:15:38.536 --> 00:15:39.910
And the other cool
thing about it

00:15:39.910 --> 00:15:43.780
is it's the thing that
everybody on the team can do.

00:15:43.780 --> 00:15:45.970
Everyone participates.

00:15:45.970 --> 00:15:48.100
Everyone participates.

00:15:48.100 --> 00:15:51.340
So here I am, I didn't know
how this was going to work.

00:15:51.340 --> 00:15:55.400
Because I'd never taken over
a situation where I didn't

00:15:55.400 --> 00:15:57.340
basically know all the answers.

00:15:57.340 --> 00:15:59.582
So my world was turned
upside down here.

00:16:03.340 --> 00:16:06.340
My hatch would fall off.

00:16:06.340 --> 00:16:07.570
Down in the sonar room.

00:16:07.570 --> 00:16:09.599
So there's no windows
on the submarine.

00:16:09.599 --> 00:16:11.890
What we learn about in the
outside world, we listen to.

00:16:11.890 --> 00:16:14.320
You hear and see in the movies
like this pinging, pinging,

00:16:14.320 --> 00:16:15.490
that sonar?

00:16:15.490 --> 00:16:17.290
We don't do any of that pinging.

00:16:17.290 --> 00:16:19.180
That pinging would give us away.

00:16:19.180 --> 00:16:22.330
We convert the sound
to these yellow lines.

00:16:22.330 --> 00:16:24.400
And we analyze it
and we say, oh,

00:16:24.400 --> 00:16:26.600
that's a surface ship,
that's a school of shrimp.

00:16:26.600 --> 00:16:27.730
That's a distant oil well.

00:16:27.730 --> 00:16:29.270
That's a submarine.

00:16:29.270 --> 00:16:32.242
And it's important
to know what's what.

00:16:32.242 --> 00:16:33.700
And then we have
all these buttons.

00:16:33.700 --> 00:16:36.569
And this is how we interact
with our equipment.

00:16:36.569 --> 00:16:38.110
Now on the Olympia
I would have known

00:16:38.110 --> 00:16:39.276
how every button dip worked.

00:16:39.276 --> 00:16:41.350
But on the Santa
Fe, I didn't know.

00:16:41.350 --> 00:16:43.850
So I walked down the ship, I
just took over, and I said hey,

00:16:43.850 --> 00:16:45.190
tell me about your buttons here.

00:16:45.190 --> 00:16:47.360
And the sailors would be like,
well, this button does this,

00:16:47.360 --> 00:16:48.276
this button does that.

00:16:48.276 --> 00:16:50.320
They're all confident
about what they're doing.

00:16:50.320 --> 00:16:52.319
And then there'd by this
button off to the side,

00:16:52.319 --> 00:16:54.100
like over here.

00:16:54.100 --> 00:16:55.505
OK, what about this one?

00:16:55.505 --> 00:16:57.380
I noticed the sailor
would avoid that button,

00:16:57.380 --> 00:16:59.580
so I knew hey, what
about this one.

00:17:03.850 --> 00:17:05.530
I forget.

00:17:05.530 --> 00:17:06.730
That was a no, no.

00:17:06.730 --> 00:17:09.700
Because they expected
this, well, I'll tell you.

00:17:09.700 --> 00:17:11.690
But I didn't know either.

00:17:11.690 --> 00:17:14.140
So the first thing was,
oh man, I shouldn't

00:17:14.140 --> 00:17:15.470
have asked that question.

00:17:15.470 --> 00:17:17.440
Because now they're
all looking at me.

00:17:17.440 --> 00:17:19.359
And it was very scary.

00:17:19.359 --> 00:17:24.140
Going into combat for me was not
scary, but this was very scary.

00:17:24.140 --> 00:17:27.400
I wanted to pretend I
knew, but I couldn't.

00:17:27.400 --> 00:17:30.480
First of all, the clock
was ticking in my head.

00:17:30.480 --> 00:17:34.030
I was finally like,
I don't know either.

00:17:34.030 --> 00:17:36.640
But you're a submarine captain.

00:17:36.640 --> 00:17:37.812
Yeah, go figure.

00:17:37.812 --> 00:17:40.294
[LAUGHTER]

00:17:40.294 --> 00:17:42.460
And I said hey, let's press
it and see what happens.

00:17:45.590 --> 00:17:48.760
So I'm going start getting
to some of these myths now.

00:17:48.760 --> 00:17:51.670
Myth number one, good
leaders know all the answers.

00:17:51.670 --> 00:17:52.570
Wrong.

00:17:52.570 --> 00:17:55.030
Fact, good leaders
say I don't know.

00:17:55.030 --> 00:17:56.740
I don't know opens
the door to learning.

00:17:56.740 --> 00:17:59.150
Even when you know,
it's helpful, I think,

00:17:59.150 --> 00:18:02.470
to just say I don't know,
what do you guys think.

00:18:02.470 --> 00:18:04.480
For as long as
you think you know

00:18:04.480 --> 00:18:06.340
and you keep saying
you know stuff,

00:18:06.340 --> 00:18:09.040
you're not going to create a
team that's curious and has

00:18:09.040 --> 00:18:10.430
a learning mindset.

00:18:10.430 --> 00:18:12.871
So it's OK to say you
don't know something.

00:18:12.871 --> 00:18:14.870
It's going to break the
paradigm from the normal

00:18:14.870 --> 00:18:16.752
know all tell all paradigm.

00:18:16.752 --> 00:18:19.002
The next thing that happened
had to do with this knob.

00:18:19.002 --> 00:18:22.171
This is how we control the
speed of the submarine.

00:18:22.171 --> 00:18:24.670
Now I just took over the worst
performing ship in the fleet.

00:18:24.670 --> 00:18:26.860
And what we're going to do
is our favorite exercise,

00:18:26.860 --> 00:18:28.720
we're going to shut
down a reactor,

00:18:28.720 --> 00:18:30.990
and we're going to run on
an electric backup motor.

00:18:30.990 --> 00:18:33.430
This is not like a Tesla, right?

00:18:33.430 --> 00:18:35.950
This is a 300 horsepower
electric motor,

00:18:35.950 --> 00:18:37.870
but it's in a 6,000
ton submarine.

00:18:37.870 --> 00:18:40.510
So this electric motor just
barely pushes the submarine

00:18:40.510 --> 00:18:41.650
through the water.

00:18:41.650 --> 00:18:42.660
And there's two speeds.

00:18:42.660 --> 00:18:43.780
So what's happening
is when you're

00:18:43.780 --> 00:18:46.150
operating the electric motor
with the reactor shut down,

00:18:46.150 --> 00:18:48.490
you're draining the
battery pretty quickly.

00:18:48.490 --> 00:18:52.450
And there's a race to
get the reactor started.

00:18:52.450 --> 00:18:54.220
So here we are,
we're running on.

00:18:54.220 --> 00:18:56.020
We're at 1/3.

00:18:56.020 --> 00:18:58.790
We shut down the reactors,
the very first drill.

00:18:58.790 --> 00:19:01.439
I'm standing in
the control room.

00:19:01.439 --> 00:19:02.980
The officer has been
on the submarine

00:19:02.980 --> 00:19:06.669
the longest, Bill Green is
his name, is controlling this.

00:19:06.669 --> 00:19:07.960
And he's doing the right thing.

00:19:07.960 --> 00:19:10.261
He's ahead 1/3,
conserving the battery.

00:19:10.261 --> 00:19:12.010
Now in every other
submarine I've been on,

00:19:12.010 --> 00:19:14.110
there was two speeds
to this electric motor.

00:19:14.110 --> 00:19:18.790
But unbeknownst to me, on the
Santa Fe, there's only one.

00:19:18.790 --> 00:19:20.445
So I'm thinking,
hey, if we speed up,

00:19:20.445 --> 00:19:22.070
it's going to drain
the battery faster,

00:19:22.070 --> 00:19:24.320
it's gonna put some
stress on the team.

00:19:24.320 --> 00:19:25.600
Train harder.

00:19:25.600 --> 00:19:27.550
And so I suggest, hey,
why don't we speed up

00:19:27.550 --> 00:19:29.770
on this electric motor?

00:19:29.770 --> 00:19:31.240
And he gives the order.

00:19:31.240 --> 00:19:32.740
But the sailor
sitting at this panel

00:19:32.740 --> 00:19:36.190
does nothing, actually
kind of goes like this.

00:19:36.190 --> 00:19:38.010
I said, hey, what's going on?

00:19:38.010 --> 00:19:40.900
He says captain, on this
ship, unlike your other ships,

00:19:40.900 --> 00:19:43.360
it's just one speed motoring.

00:19:43.360 --> 00:19:44.771
That was embarrassing.

00:19:44.771 --> 00:19:46.270
And I thought about
Bill, and I said

00:19:46.270 --> 00:19:47.590
Bill, do you know about this.

00:19:47.590 --> 00:19:51.100
And he said, yes, sir I did.

00:19:51.100 --> 00:19:52.750
Really?

00:19:52.750 --> 00:19:54.520
Well, riddle me this.

00:19:54.520 --> 00:19:55.990
Why did you order it?

00:19:55.990 --> 00:19:57.545
What do you guys think he said?

00:19:57.545 --> 00:19:59.920
Exactly, because it's all
about telling people what to do

00:19:59.920 --> 00:20:02.800
and doing what you're told.

00:20:02.800 --> 00:20:05.050
And this was like a
hammer blow to my head.

00:20:05.050 --> 00:20:06.550
Because my whole
leadership training

00:20:06.550 --> 00:20:10.030
was about being really good
at telling people what to do.

00:20:10.030 --> 00:20:12.464
So I said, look,
I'm going to stop

00:20:12.464 --> 00:20:13.630
telling you guys what to do.

00:20:13.630 --> 00:20:15.213
I'm gonna stop giving
you guys orders.

00:20:15.213 --> 00:20:17.120
I'm never going to
give another order

00:20:17.120 --> 00:20:18.790
as a captain of a submarine.

00:20:18.790 --> 00:20:21.017
And they were like, OK.

00:20:21.017 --> 00:20:22.600
No one knew what
that would look like,

00:20:22.600 --> 00:20:24.610
but it was better than
dying, which is what

00:20:24.610 --> 00:20:26.320
would have happened eventually.

00:20:26.320 --> 00:20:29.800
So we say, good leaders give
good orders, that's the myth.

00:20:29.800 --> 00:20:32.050
I now think good leaders
actually don't give orders.

00:20:32.050 --> 00:20:36.516
They create a team that doesn't
need to be told what to do.

00:20:36.516 --> 00:20:38.890
So now I've decided not to
give my guys any instructions.

00:20:38.890 --> 00:20:40.265
I still don't know
the submarine.

00:20:40.265 --> 00:20:43.600
So now I'm a know
not, tell not leader.

00:20:43.600 --> 00:20:45.460
If you're brand new
to an organization,

00:20:45.460 --> 00:20:48.810
maybe this is where you need
to live for a few days, weeks,

00:20:48.810 --> 00:20:49.310
or months.

00:20:49.310 --> 00:20:50.500
But eventually people
are going to stop

00:20:50.500 --> 00:20:52.110
paying you for being down here.

00:20:52.110 --> 00:20:54.950
So it's not a good
long term strategy.

00:20:54.950 --> 00:20:57.617
Now the torpedoes,
here's how they work.

00:20:57.617 --> 00:20:59.200
First of all, there's
a long wire that

00:20:59.200 --> 00:21:00.450
pays out through the ocean.

00:21:00.450 --> 00:21:03.970
So when we shoot the torpedo, it
connects back to the submarine

00:21:03.970 --> 00:21:05.680
and it sends signals
back saying, here's

00:21:05.680 --> 00:21:08.860
what I'm seeing as I'm out
here looking for the bad guy.

00:21:08.860 --> 00:21:10.940
And we can steer it.

00:21:10.940 --> 00:21:13.610
We can say turn
right 20 degrees.

00:21:13.610 --> 00:21:14.470
Turn left, whatever.

00:21:14.470 --> 00:21:18.349
We can chase down the enemy.

00:21:18.349 --> 00:21:19.390
So they're pretty potent.

00:21:19.390 --> 00:21:22.810
Then they don't hit the ship
like you see in the movies.

00:21:22.810 --> 00:21:26.510
They actually go under,
and then they detonate.

00:21:26.510 --> 00:21:29.480
And what we're doing is
blowing a hole in the ocean.

00:21:29.480 --> 00:21:30.070
Why?

00:21:30.070 --> 00:21:33.250
Because then the ship
falls into that hole.

00:21:33.250 --> 00:21:34.030
Breaks in half.

00:21:36.850 --> 00:21:39.760
And you end up right here.

00:21:39.760 --> 00:21:41.290
So that's what sinks the ship.

00:21:41.290 --> 00:21:44.590
So these torpedoes
are big deals.

00:21:44.590 --> 00:21:47.380
Here, we're loading
a torpedo in Japan.

00:21:47.380 --> 00:21:49.510
Now I was all about
empowering my team.

00:21:49.510 --> 00:21:52.450
I got on this kick of I'm
not going to give any orders.

00:21:52.450 --> 00:21:55.270
Like what do you think,
and it was all about that.

00:21:55.270 --> 00:21:57.940
I was really good about it, in
fact I was really bad about it.

00:21:57.940 --> 00:22:01.000
Because I did it so well
that we were setting up

00:22:01.000 --> 00:22:04.387
to do this and they
made a mistake.

00:22:04.387 --> 00:22:05.970
And before we did
it with the torpedo,

00:22:05.970 --> 00:22:08.340
we do it with a shape,
a concrete shape, which

00:22:08.340 --> 00:22:10.490
is the same shape and weight.

00:22:10.490 --> 00:22:13.110
But it's inert, and
we end up dropping it.

00:22:13.110 --> 00:22:15.210
We almost could've
killed somebody.

00:22:15.210 --> 00:22:17.460
And I was really scared, I
was like oh, this is wrong.

00:22:17.460 --> 00:22:19.140
This is the wrong
way to do business.

00:22:19.140 --> 00:22:21.360
I need to go back and be
in control of everything.

00:22:21.360 --> 00:22:22.860
But I talked to my
team and we said,

00:22:22.860 --> 00:22:24.870
you know what, it's not that.

00:22:24.870 --> 00:22:26.610
We're just missing something.

00:22:26.610 --> 00:22:28.330
And here's the model
we came up with.

00:22:28.330 --> 00:22:31.500
We said, I've given
too much control.

00:22:31.500 --> 00:22:34.380
I was irresponsibly
giving control.

00:22:34.380 --> 00:22:37.260
And what I really needed to do
was tune the level of control

00:22:37.260 --> 00:22:41.730
to how much they knew about
their jobs and the clarity

00:22:41.730 --> 00:22:42.870
of purpose.

00:22:42.870 --> 00:22:45.672
This is the why that
Simon Sineks talks about.

00:22:45.672 --> 00:22:47.130
Because if you say,
you get to make

00:22:47.130 --> 00:22:48.713
a decision on which
customer you call,

00:22:48.713 --> 00:22:52.380
you could talk, forget the
script, just talk to him.

00:22:52.380 --> 00:22:55.590
You need to know what
we're trying to achieve.

00:22:55.590 --> 00:22:58.912
And so we now say leaders tune.

00:22:58.912 --> 00:22:59.620
The word is tune.

00:22:59.620 --> 00:23:02.600
We tune the level of control
and we invite the team

00:23:02.600 --> 00:23:04.840
to higher and higher levels.

00:23:04.840 --> 00:23:06.831
So we don't empower teams.

00:23:06.831 --> 00:23:08.580
First of all, teams
are already empowered.

00:23:08.580 --> 00:23:11.119
It's inside every human being.

00:23:11.119 --> 00:23:13.410
But what we do is we tune
the empowerment to the levels

00:23:13.410 --> 00:23:15.450
of competence and control.

00:23:15.450 --> 00:23:17.950
Otherwise, it's just
irresponsibility.

00:23:17.950 --> 00:23:19.740
Now, this is Dr. Stephen Covey.

00:23:19.740 --> 00:23:22.000
He wrote "7 Habits of Highly
Effective People," which

00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:24.654
is an awesome book and
I was a huge Covey fan.

00:23:24.654 --> 00:23:26.070
And what happened
on the submarine

00:23:26.070 --> 00:23:28.170
was things started going
really, really well.

00:23:28.170 --> 00:23:29.900
Every single sailor
in the next 12 months

00:23:29.900 --> 00:23:32.460
re-enlisted, 35 out of 35.

00:23:32.460 --> 00:23:34.547
And we were evaluated
by the Navy,

00:23:34.547 --> 00:23:36.630
and the crew of the Santa
Fe got the highest score

00:23:36.630 --> 00:23:38.700
in the history of
the inspection team.

00:23:38.700 --> 00:23:41.440
They never had records
that had a higher score.

00:23:41.440 --> 00:23:43.560
And everyone was
really confused.

00:23:43.560 --> 00:23:47.400
How did that crew that
was so bad get so good?

00:23:47.400 --> 00:23:50.160
And the rest of the Navy
thought I was just giving some

00:23:50.160 --> 00:23:53.520
really great orders.

00:23:53.520 --> 00:23:57.250
My peers would call me
and say, congratulations,

00:23:57.250 --> 00:24:00.070
you must be making some
really good orders.

00:24:00.070 --> 00:24:02.700
I'd just be like, I'm actually
trying this new thing.

00:24:02.700 --> 00:24:06.660
I'm not giving orders, not
telling them what to do.

00:24:06.660 --> 00:24:07.990
They're like, what?

00:24:07.990 --> 00:24:10.170
Like, yeah, nevermind.

00:24:10.170 --> 00:24:13.540
Because from their paradigm,
it just didn't work.

00:24:13.540 --> 00:24:16.470
But what we had done, I realized
that later what we'd done

00:24:16.470 --> 00:24:20.070
is gone from one leader
and 134 followers,

00:24:20.070 --> 00:24:22.320
and one thinker
and 134 doers, just

00:24:22.320 --> 00:24:26.100
like that picture of the
factory to 135 active thinking,

00:24:26.100 --> 00:24:29.940
passionate, creative people,
which I call leadership.

00:24:29.940 --> 00:24:33.707
My role as the
captain was simply

00:24:33.707 --> 00:24:35.790
to create this environment
where people could come

00:24:35.790 --> 00:24:37.360
to work and just be their best.

00:24:37.360 --> 00:24:38.430
That's all I did.

00:24:38.430 --> 00:24:41.410
All day long, all day long.

00:24:41.410 --> 00:24:42.870
And it worked amazing.

00:24:42.870 --> 00:24:46.320
And so Dr. Covery
watched the ship.

00:24:46.320 --> 00:24:47.670
And now we were about intent.

00:24:47.670 --> 00:24:49.170
I'm stopping telling
you what to do,

00:24:49.170 --> 00:24:52.855
but you've got to come to me to
tell me what you intend to do.

00:24:52.855 --> 00:24:54.380
If I'm not telling
you what to do

00:24:54.380 --> 00:24:56.550
and you're not doing anything,
then I'm leaning back

00:24:56.550 --> 00:24:58.230
and you're not leaning in to me.

00:24:58.230 --> 00:25:00.240
So I actually think
leaders lean back

00:25:00.240 --> 00:25:02.850
and the team leans forward.

00:25:02.850 --> 00:25:06.540
So Dr. Covey saw how
we talked to each other

00:25:06.540 --> 00:25:09.540
and he said this is how I
think you guys are doing it.

00:25:09.540 --> 00:25:11.790
When people come up and say,
well, tell me what to do,

00:25:11.790 --> 00:25:14.275
we resist telling
them what to do.

00:25:14.275 --> 00:25:16.650
The instinct is you want to,
because you know the answer,

00:25:16.650 --> 00:25:21.060
and it's so psychologically
fulfilling to say yes, do this.

00:25:21.060 --> 00:25:23.460
Boy, I solved so many
people's problems today.

00:25:23.460 --> 00:25:25.900
Well, don't I feel
good about that.

00:25:25.900 --> 00:25:27.810
And we say, well,
what do you see?

00:25:27.810 --> 00:25:30.050
This is description.

00:25:30.050 --> 00:25:31.320
What do you think?

00:25:31.320 --> 00:25:32.670
What do you think we should do?

00:25:32.670 --> 00:25:33.920
Hey, what do you intend to do?

00:25:33.920 --> 00:25:35.620
Maybe you should just do it.

00:25:35.620 --> 00:25:36.690
Depends on what it is.

00:25:36.690 --> 00:25:39.420
We would just invite people
and we'd have close the latter,

00:25:39.420 --> 00:25:42.270
and you guys have a card
that describes how this went.

00:25:42.270 --> 00:25:43.620
But this is how you tune it.

00:25:43.620 --> 00:25:46.795
This is why you can
dial it exactly.

00:25:50.400 --> 00:25:52.320
Question for you.

00:25:52.320 --> 00:25:56.010
So you've got
someone on your team

00:25:56.010 --> 00:25:59.700
and they're down there,
tell me what to do.

00:26:01.830 --> 00:26:04.080
You probably don't have any
of these people at Google,

00:26:04.080 --> 00:26:05.527
but just imagine you did.

00:26:05.527 --> 00:26:07.110
They're like, well,
what do I do here?

00:26:07.110 --> 00:26:08.165
And you're inviting them.

00:26:08.165 --> 00:26:09.540
You say, well,
what do you think?

00:26:09.540 --> 00:26:11.220
What should we do?

00:26:11.220 --> 00:26:13.500
And they just seem stuck
at tell me what to do.

00:26:13.500 --> 00:26:15.868
What keeps people stuck
at tell me what to do.

00:26:15.868 --> 00:26:18.284
Go ahead and send a bunch of
words, let's see what we get.

00:26:21.060 --> 00:26:22.560
And you can type
in a bunch of words

00:26:22.560 --> 00:26:24.665
and hit enter and have
all the words come up.

00:26:24.665 --> 00:26:25.790
Get a whole bunch of words.

00:26:32.729 --> 00:26:33.770
Let's see what we've got.

00:26:33.770 --> 00:26:37.850
Confusion, confidence,
disillusionment, understanding,

00:26:37.850 --> 00:26:42.230
inexperience, mistakes, pride,
misunderstanding, status,

00:26:42.230 --> 00:26:43.130
superiority.

00:26:46.280 --> 00:26:49.910
And fear.

00:26:49.910 --> 00:26:53.570
Fear is always the
biggest problem.

00:26:53.570 --> 00:26:56.420
I've done this to
over 100 audiences

00:26:56.420 --> 00:26:59.269
in 20 different countries
and every single time,

00:26:59.269 --> 00:27:00.560
fear has been the biggest word.

00:27:00.560 --> 00:27:03.500
In fact, if I aggregate
those 100 speeches,

00:27:03.500 --> 00:27:05.941
this is what it looks like.

00:27:05.941 --> 00:27:07.940
The reason people are not
saying what they think

00:27:07.940 --> 00:27:09.339
is not because they don't know.

00:27:09.339 --> 00:27:11.130
It's because they're
afraid of being wrong,

00:27:11.130 --> 00:27:12.500
they're afraid of
being laughed at,

00:27:12.500 --> 00:27:14.180
they're afraid of being the
person who thinks differently

00:27:14.180 --> 00:27:16.460
from everybody else, afraid
of taking responsibility,

00:27:16.460 --> 00:27:17.930
whatever it happens to be.

00:27:17.930 --> 00:27:22.340
And this gets me to the
next leadership myth.

00:27:22.340 --> 00:27:25.250
I thought my job as a leader
was to quote "motivate" my team.

00:27:25.250 --> 00:27:28.370
And a lot of times,
motivate meant add stress.

00:27:28.370 --> 00:27:29.780
Come on, guys, we can do it.

00:27:32.900 --> 00:27:35.290
What leaders need to do
is make it feel safe.

00:27:35.290 --> 00:27:37.010
Because fear is the problem.

00:27:37.010 --> 00:27:40.070
So the antidote
to fear is safety.

00:27:40.070 --> 00:27:44.770
So my job all day long
was to say yeah, it's OK.

00:27:44.770 --> 00:27:46.400
Express that in probabilities.

00:27:49.020 --> 00:27:53.140
Just give me a scale, 1 to 10,
how do you think about that.

00:27:53.140 --> 00:27:55.790
And really ask questions in
a way that made it feel safe.

00:27:55.790 --> 00:27:57.459
I'll give you a
very small example.

00:27:57.459 --> 00:27:59.000
People would come
up to me and they'd

00:27:59.000 --> 00:28:01.790
say, well, I think we should
do this, are you sure.

00:28:01.790 --> 00:28:04.520
No, that doesn't feel safe.

00:28:04.520 --> 00:28:09.170
No, I'm not sure to be honest.

00:28:09.170 --> 00:28:11.440
Or they have this
false bravado, yes, I'm

00:28:11.440 --> 00:28:14.580
sure, which is always wrong.

00:28:14.580 --> 00:28:19.040
So what's your sense of
enthusiasm over this.

00:28:19.040 --> 00:28:21.300
And we'd ask
questions, if you want

00:28:21.300 --> 00:28:23.120
a clue for asking a
question, always try

00:28:23.120 --> 00:28:25.250
to put how at the beginning.

00:28:25.250 --> 00:28:27.640
How likely it is we're going
to launch a product on time.

00:28:27.640 --> 00:28:30.406
Not will we launch on time.

00:28:30.406 --> 00:28:31.280
We just make it safe.

00:28:31.280 --> 00:28:34.160
And all day long, trying to
make it safe for my people

00:28:34.160 --> 00:28:36.080
to share what they
thought, even if it was

00:28:36.080 --> 00:28:38.340
potentially wrong or different.

00:28:38.340 --> 00:28:40.796
Especially if it were different.

00:28:40.796 --> 00:28:42.620
Here we are, we're
fighting a fire.

00:28:42.620 --> 00:28:45.506
We were not very good at this
when I first got to the ship.

00:28:45.506 --> 00:28:46.880
And then we'd sit
in a room, we'd

00:28:46.880 --> 00:28:51.920
do a retrospective or a critique
or a fact finding, whatever

00:28:51.920 --> 00:28:53.210
you want to call it.

00:28:53.210 --> 00:28:54.665
And I heard a lot of that.

00:28:54.665 --> 00:28:56.790
I was listening to the
language and they would say,

00:28:56.790 --> 00:28:59.649
well, they didn't
pressurize the hose,

00:28:59.649 --> 00:29:01.940
they didn't change the
batteries on the thermal imager.

00:29:01.940 --> 00:29:04.280
They hung the gear up
twisted, so it took me

00:29:04.280 --> 00:29:06.320
longer to get there
than it should have.

00:29:06.320 --> 00:29:07.850
There was all this
they, referring

00:29:07.850 --> 00:29:11.050
to all these other people
on board the submarine.

00:29:11.050 --> 00:29:14.230
There was they by rank,
there was they by department.

00:29:14.230 --> 00:29:18.050
And I got upset one
day with this they.

00:29:18.050 --> 00:29:19.940
Because it didn't
feel like a team.

00:29:19.940 --> 00:29:22.730
I said there's no
more they on Santa Fe.

00:29:22.730 --> 00:29:24.920
It rhymed.

00:29:24.920 --> 00:29:26.570
So that was good.

00:29:26.570 --> 00:29:27.827
You can only use the word we.

00:29:27.827 --> 00:29:29.660
Very next day, the
engineer walked up to me.

00:29:29.660 --> 00:29:32.630
Now he wants to tell me
that the supply department,

00:29:32.630 --> 00:29:35.360
he's in charge of engineering,
that the supply department

00:29:35.360 --> 00:29:38.317
has ordered the wrong part.

00:29:38.317 --> 00:29:39.650
You know what I'm talking about.

00:29:39.650 --> 00:29:40.580
So he comes up to me.

00:29:40.580 --> 00:29:42.197
He says, Captain,
I've got bad news.

00:29:42.197 --> 00:29:44.030
I'm kind of hanging out
in the control room,

00:29:44.030 --> 00:29:45.030
like I would usually do.

00:29:45.030 --> 00:29:46.890
He says, Captain,
I've got bad news.

00:29:46.890 --> 00:29:49.020
I said yeah, what do you got?

00:29:49.020 --> 00:29:54.680
Says, Captain, we can't
fix the pump, because th--

00:29:54.680 --> 00:29:59.160
th-- he wants to say
they, but he can't.

00:29:59.160 --> 00:30:04.520
So he says because we
ordered the wrong part.

00:30:04.520 --> 00:30:08.540
I kind of look at him, he
looks at me, I look at him,

00:30:08.540 --> 00:30:11.180
and he just goes like.

00:30:11.180 --> 00:30:13.520
It was super awesome.

00:30:13.520 --> 00:30:15.230
There's no blame
in recommendations.

00:30:15.230 --> 00:30:17.030
So when I go into
organizations, I

00:30:17.030 --> 00:30:19.160
listen for what I call
the we they boundary.

00:30:19.160 --> 00:30:21.490
Like where is it we?

00:30:21.490 --> 00:30:25.719
Like we're in the engineering,
but they're in marketing.

00:30:25.719 --> 00:30:27.260
And where does it
go from we to they?

00:30:27.260 --> 00:30:28.490
Because as soon as you
go from we to they,

00:30:28.490 --> 00:30:30.410
that's where the
team boundary ends.

00:30:30.410 --> 00:30:32.870
And so the problem is
most people say well,

00:30:32.870 --> 00:30:34.790
think like a team.

00:30:34.790 --> 00:30:38.660
Here's some posters
that tell us.

00:30:38.660 --> 00:30:42.000
Send some emails to
encourage people, whatever.

00:30:42.000 --> 00:30:44.540
That doesn't make team
performance happen.

00:30:44.540 --> 00:30:45.980
We just said the word we.

00:30:45.980 --> 00:30:48.770
And six months later, we
had rewired our brains

00:30:48.770 --> 00:30:49.930
and it felt like a team.

00:30:49.930 --> 00:30:51.670
People would come down the
ship and say oh, it's amazing,

00:30:51.670 --> 00:30:52.850
it feels like a team.

00:30:52.850 --> 00:30:54.830
They wouldn't even know why.

00:30:54.830 --> 00:30:57.810
But it was because we
now became one big we.

00:30:57.810 --> 00:31:01.100
And so this gets me to there's
the no they on Santa Fe.

00:31:01.100 --> 00:31:06.260
Myth number five, which is teams
think their way to new action.

00:31:06.260 --> 00:31:08.516
Any change management that
I've seen starts with well,

00:31:08.516 --> 00:31:10.890
we've got to create a mindset
and blah, blah, blah, blah,

00:31:10.890 --> 00:31:11.390
blah.

00:31:11.390 --> 00:31:14.120
That's I'm going to think my way
to new behavior, which I don't

00:31:14.120 --> 00:31:15.500
think is the way it works.

00:31:15.500 --> 00:31:17.840
We behave our way
to new thinking.

00:31:17.840 --> 00:31:20.150
A perfect example is
in your lunchroom.

00:31:20.150 --> 00:31:23.210
Because Google did a study,
because they wanted more team

00:31:23.210 --> 00:31:23.732
interaction.

00:31:23.732 --> 00:31:25.940
They found out they had all
these little small tables

00:31:25.940 --> 00:31:26.979
in all the lunchrooms.

00:31:26.979 --> 00:31:28.395
So when people go
to lunch, they'd

00:31:28.395 --> 00:31:31.010
only sit with two or
three people at most.

00:31:31.010 --> 00:31:33.279
You replace them and now
you have those long tables.

00:31:33.279 --> 00:31:34.820
It's because of when
you go to lunch,

00:31:34.820 --> 00:31:36.980
now you can sit with
bigger groups of people.

00:31:36.980 --> 00:31:39.079
We don't give people a lecture.

00:31:39.079 --> 00:31:41.120
We don't annoy them with
a whole bunch of emails.

00:31:41.120 --> 00:31:42.867
We just put some big tables in.

00:31:42.867 --> 00:31:45.200
They sit with more people,
they get to know more people.

00:31:45.200 --> 00:31:46.544
It feels like more of a team.

00:31:46.544 --> 00:31:47.960
So we act our way
to new thinking.

00:31:51.350 --> 00:31:53.510
So at the end of the
day, partly because I

00:31:53.510 --> 00:31:55.540
was curious and not afraid
to say I don't know,

00:31:55.540 --> 00:31:57.140
I learned the ship.

00:31:57.140 --> 00:31:59.030
I learned it pretty well.

00:31:59.030 --> 00:32:01.550
My temptation was to
go back to be the old

00:32:01.550 --> 00:32:02.910
know all, tell all leader.

00:32:02.910 --> 00:32:06.010
Because I was firmly
rooted in that behavior.

00:32:06.010 --> 00:32:07.640
When I got stressed
out, I would always

00:32:07.640 --> 00:32:08.890
default back to that behavior.

00:32:08.890 --> 00:32:11.520
That was my default wiring.

00:32:11.520 --> 00:32:13.850
If I hadn't slept
well, didn't eat well.

00:32:13.850 --> 00:32:15.590
My boss yelled at
me, so of course,

00:32:15.590 --> 00:32:18.680
I had to yell at my people.

00:32:18.680 --> 00:32:21.680
But I'd seen the power of not
telling my people what to do.

00:32:21.680 --> 00:32:26.030
Because I'd seen this explosion
in creativity and performance

00:32:26.030 --> 00:32:26.540
in the team.

00:32:26.540 --> 00:32:29.420
I saw the excitement
in their eyes.

00:32:29.420 --> 00:32:30.890
So I really resisted it.

00:32:30.890 --> 00:32:34.580
So now I tried as much as
possible to live over here.

00:32:34.580 --> 00:32:37.080
Even when I knew the answer and
they came up to me and said,

00:32:37.080 --> 00:32:38.600
well what do you
want us to do here,

00:32:38.600 --> 00:32:40.400
I would really
resist telling them.

00:32:40.400 --> 00:32:43.100
Because over here, you
focus on ownership.

00:32:43.100 --> 00:32:44.764
Over here, you focus
on the long term.

00:32:44.764 --> 00:32:46.430
Over here you're
focusing on your people

00:32:46.430 --> 00:32:48.900
and developing
them into leaders.

00:32:48.900 --> 00:32:52.070
And yeah, some days you might
need to operate over here.

00:32:52.070 --> 00:32:53.790
But here's task accomplishment.

00:32:53.790 --> 00:32:54.774
This is short term.

00:32:54.774 --> 00:32:56.690
This is where, unfortunately,
a lot of leaders

00:32:56.690 --> 00:32:58.520
live all the time.

00:32:58.520 --> 00:33:01.820
You should decide where
you want to be here.

00:33:01.820 --> 00:33:02.574
You should decide.

00:33:02.574 --> 00:33:04.490
It shouldn't be determined
just by whether you

00:33:04.490 --> 00:33:05.450
know the answer or not.

00:33:05.450 --> 00:33:07.824
Most leaders, if they know
the answer, they operate here.

00:33:07.824 --> 00:33:09.710
If they don't,
they operate here.

00:33:09.710 --> 00:33:11.145
They're down here, right?

00:33:11.145 --> 00:33:12.770
I can't tell you,
because I don't know.

00:33:12.770 --> 00:33:14.850
Or sometimes they operate here.

00:33:14.850 --> 00:33:19.190
I don't know, but I'm
still going to tell you.

00:33:19.190 --> 00:33:22.250
Myth number six, leaders
know all, tell all.

00:33:22.250 --> 00:33:24.650
The fact is the right
place for a leader

00:33:24.650 --> 00:33:27.290
to be is to still know your job.

00:33:27.290 --> 00:33:30.732
I'm not saying the lesson
is not don't know your job.

00:33:30.732 --> 00:33:33.190
That's what it took for me to
understand the power of this,

00:33:33.190 --> 00:33:34.090
though.

00:33:34.090 --> 00:33:37.170
But to resist giving
your team the answer.

00:33:37.170 --> 00:33:39.360
So one last poll, one last poll.

00:33:39.360 --> 00:33:43.702
A lot of what I'm talking about
is about giving up control.

00:33:43.702 --> 00:33:46.160
So I want you to think, and
again push in a bunch of words.

00:33:46.160 --> 00:33:48.118
In fact take 30 seconds,
talk to your neighbor.

00:33:48.118 --> 00:33:50.900
And then together, let's put in
a bunch of words about what it

00:33:50.900 --> 00:33:52.820
feels like to give up control.

00:33:52.820 --> 00:33:57.470
Here's the thing I tell my
CEOs that I'm coaching to do.

00:33:57.470 --> 00:33:58.700
I say, you can go to dinner.

00:33:58.700 --> 00:34:01.322
Next time you go out to
eat, you don't get to order.

00:34:01.322 --> 00:34:03.530
I want you to just turn to
the waiter or the waitress

00:34:03.530 --> 00:34:06.590
and say, pick my meal.

00:34:06.590 --> 00:34:09.071
They're all control freaks,
so this freaks them out.

00:34:09.071 --> 00:34:11.570
So I want you to get that in
your head and think about that,

00:34:11.570 --> 00:34:12.879
and set up a bunch of words.

00:34:12.879 --> 00:34:13.670
See what we've got.

00:34:32.020 --> 00:34:33.650
Yeah, this is coming out.

00:34:33.650 --> 00:34:34.179
I love it.

00:34:34.179 --> 00:34:35.800
Because look what we got.

00:34:35.800 --> 00:34:42.340
Scary, risk, losing.

00:34:42.340 --> 00:34:44.960
We're going to lose control.

00:34:44.960 --> 00:34:50.469
At the same time, I
have trust and freedom

00:34:50.469 --> 00:34:57.780
and other good things.

00:34:57.780 --> 00:35:01.440
They're all coming
up on the screen.

00:35:01.440 --> 00:35:05.552
These words here, this
is how I felt every day

00:35:05.552 --> 00:35:06.510
as a submarine captain.

00:35:06.510 --> 00:35:09.240
Every day when I was
trusting my team,

00:35:09.240 --> 00:35:12.150
every day when I was saying
you guys get to choose,

00:35:12.150 --> 00:35:16.770
this is how I felt. I
felt for a long time

00:35:16.770 --> 00:35:20.040
that these were
the wrong feelings.

00:35:20.040 --> 00:35:25.170
That I was doing something
wrong, because I felt this way.

00:35:25.170 --> 00:35:26.940
I was a little bit
nervous and scared.

00:35:26.940 --> 00:35:32.880
I call it the suck air
through teeth maneuver.

00:35:32.880 --> 00:35:34.390
That's your call.

00:35:34.390 --> 00:35:36.697
See what you guys do with that.

00:35:36.697 --> 00:35:39.030
But I now think this is
actually the way you're supposed

00:35:39.030 --> 00:35:41.600
to feel every day as a leader.

00:35:41.600 --> 00:35:43.920
Every day, if you
don't feel like you're

00:35:43.920 --> 00:35:46.536
on the verge of
this, then you're

00:35:46.536 --> 00:35:47.910
playing it too
close to the vest.

00:35:47.910 --> 00:35:48.940
You're too in control.

00:35:48.940 --> 00:35:50.730
You're too comfortable and
you're not building a team.

00:35:50.730 --> 00:35:51.563
It's just about you.

00:35:54.000 --> 00:35:57.570
So the final thing here is we
talk about oh, trust your gut,

00:35:57.570 --> 00:35:58.980
trust your instincts.

00:35:58.980 --> 00:36:01.740
But part of
leadership is feeling

00:36:01.740 --> 00:36:04.050
the way you're programmed
as a human to feel.

00:36:04.050 --> 00:36:06.540
Because you're program
to want to be in control

00:36:06.540 --> 00:36:09.090
and to reduce uncertainty.

00:36:09.090 --> 00:36:13.710
It's wading into that,
leaning into that discomfort

00:36:13.710 --> 00:36:19.710
and acting contrary to how your
gut might take you many times.

00:36:19.710 --> 00:36:23.070
Because it's not normal to
put your life in the hands

00:36:23.070 --> 00:36:25.380
of some other person.

00:36:25.380 --> 00:36:30.450
You're not biologically
wired to like that.

00:36:30.450 --> 00:36:33.139
But I think this
is the real way.

00:36:33.139 --> 00:36:34.430
This is why leadership is hard.

00:36:34.430 --> 00:36:36.762
That's why we have so
few really good leaders.

00:36:36.762 --> 00:36:38.470
Because you have to
act contrary to that.

00:36:43.300 --> 00:36:44.290
So we go back to this.

00:36:47.560 --> 00:36:52.180
Here's my plug to you guys, OK?

00:36:52.180 --> 00:37:00.040
You guys are some of the most
creative, talented, smart

00:37:00.040 --> 00:37:06.250
people on the planet, working
for an amazing organization.

00:37:06.250 --> 00:37:10.750
What I worry about
when I interact with--

00:37:10.750 --> 00:37:13.000
you're young people
to me, sorry--

00:37:13.000 --> 00:37:17.350
young people,
millennials, or coders

00:37:17.350 --> 00:37:19.930
is like, I don't care about
that leadership stuff.

00:37:19.930 --> 00:37:22.870
Because we've associated a
bad word with leadership.

00:37:22.870 --> 00:37:25.390
Because leadership means
telling people what to do.

00:37:25.390 --> 00:37:28.000
We have so much baggage
over leadership.

00:37:28.000 --> 00:37:30.940
So I don't want to be a leader,
I just want to be a coder.

00:37:30.940 --> 00:37:34.450
I just want to do my job.

00:37:34.450 --> 00:37:36.830
The world needs you.

00:37:36.830 --> 00:37:39.110
The world needs
you to be leaders,

00:37:39.110 --> 00:37:41.230
not in the traditional,
so I'm going

00:37:41.230 --> 00:37:43.990
to go out and tell a bunch
of people what to do.

00:37:43.990 --> 00:37:46.957
But in the way of everybody
in the organization where

00:37:46.957 --> 00:37:48.790
I'm going to listen to
the diverse opinions,

00:37:48.790 --> 00:37:51.310
I'm going to encourage
someone to say something.

00:37:51.310 --> 00:37:52.840
I'm going to be
part of making it

00:37:52.840 --> 00:37:56.634
safe to say something
that's different than what

00:37:56.634 --> 00:37:57.550
everybody else thinks.

00:38:00.430 --> 00:38:05.260
So that's my ask of you guys.

00:38:05.260 --> 00:38:07.284
Is don't shy away from that.

00:38:07.284 --> 00:38:09.700
Yeah, you've got to do your
job and you've got to do that.

00:38:09.700 --> 00:38:13.840
But start bringing in
this leadership piece.

00:38:13.840 --> 00:38:16.300
You're all leaders,
and we need it.

00:38:16.300 --> 00:38:18.250
The world needs it,
the planet needs it.

00:38:18.250 --> 00:38:23.729
Problems are too complex, too
hard, too sticky, too thorny.

00:38:23.729 --> 00:38:25.270
If you're not
convinced at this point

00:38:25.270 --> 00:38:26.810
that no group of
quote "experts" is

00:38:26.810 --> 00:38:28.670
gonna solve these
problems [INAUDIBLE],,

00:38:28.670 --> 00:38:30.110
I don't know what's going to.

00:38:30.110 --> 00:38:32.410
So we need you.

00:38:32.410 --> 00:38:33.690
The world needs you guys.

00:38:36.310 --> 00:38:38.830
One other thing,
we have a channel.

00:38:38.830 --> 00:38:41.630
It's on YouTube, of course.

00:38:41.630 --> 00:38:46.630
It's called "Leadership
Nudges" where you can

00:38:46.630 --> 00:38:48.420
see there's 150 of them now.

00:38:48.420 --> 00:38:51.010
They're typically
60 to 90 seconds.

00:38:51.010 --> 00:38:52.770
I just talk about
one little thing,

00:38:52.770 --> 00:38:55.060
one of the things we
talked about today.

00:38:55.060 --> 00:38:58.880
And sometimes weird things,
I'm going to show you one.

00:38:58.880 --> 00:39:01.760
I'm going to tell you how
you can enroll in these.

00:39:01.760 --> 00:39:10.480
But I taped this when I was in
[INAUDIBLE] a couple weeks ago.

00:39:10.480 --> 00:39:12.850
In the hotel bathroom,
I saw something that

00:39:12.850 --> 00:39:14.090
was really interesting to me.

00:39:14.090 --> 00:39:16.090
So I'm in a bathroom here.

00:39:16.090 --> 00:39:17.620
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:39:17.620 --> 00:39:19.446
- Today I'm going to
talk about mechanisms.

00:39:19.446 --> 00:39:22.606
Mechanisms are a greay way
for influencing human behavior

00:39:22.606 --> 00:39:24.160
in organizations.

00:39:24.160 --> 00:39:26.580
The way mechanisms
work is the system

00:39:26.580 --> 00:39:29.520
is designed so that you
can't help but comply

00:39:29.520 --> 00:39:31.280
with the desired behavior.

00:39:31.280 --> 00:39:34.470
In this case, it's putting
the toilet seat down.

00:39:34.470 --> 00:39:35.990
[INAUDIBLE]

00:39:35.990 --> 00:39:38.812
It works like this.

00:39:38.812 --> 00:39:40.270
The toilet seat,
when you raise it,

00:39:40.270 --> 00:39:42.202
covers the button
to flush the toilet.

00:39:42.202 --> 00:39:45.088
So you can't push the
button to flush the toilet

00:39:45.088 --> 00:39:47.040
without putting the seat down.

00:39:47.040 --> 00:39:48.130
I love it.

00:39:48.130 --> 00:39:50.992
I'm David Marquet, and
that's your Leadership Nudge.

00:39:50.992 --> 00:39:51.946
[LAUGHTER]

00:39:51.946 --> 00:39:53.854
[END PLAYBACK]

00:39:56.136 --> 00:39:58.890
DAVID MARQUET: Yeah, so I had
fun with that one obviously.

00:40:04.600 --> 00:40:06.310
You've got your phones
out, you can just

00:40:06.310 --> 00:40:10.060
text the word Nudge to 44144.

00:40:10.060 --> 00:40:12.970
You'll get on our Nudge, we'll
enroll you in the nudges.

00:40:12.970 --> 00:40:16.180
You can also send up
for them on the website,

00:40:16.180 --> 00:40:19.190
because I think this
texting is a US only thing.

00:40:19.190 --> 00:40:21.300
So you go to 44144,
type the word nudge.

00:40:21.300 --> 00:40:23.050
We're not even going
to ask for your name.

00:40:23.050 --> 00:40:25.270
All we need is your
email, and then you're

00:40:25.270 --> 00:40:27.970
going to get on the nudge list.

00:40:27.970 --> 00:40:30.370
But also, you can go back
to the YouTube channel

00:40:30.370 --> 00:40:32.619
and look at some
of the old ones.

00:40:32.619 --> 00:40:34.660
If you want to share some
of what we talked about

00:40:34.660 --> 00:40:37.720
today with your team
or anybody else,

00:40:37.720 --> 00:40:42.400
they're all on that little
YouTube channel with little 60,

00:40:42.400 --> 00:40:43.480
90 second things.

00:40:48.670 --> 00:40:50.207
That's it.

00:40:50.207 --> 00:40:52.540
I'm going to have a short
conversation here with Theron.

00:40:52.540 --> 00:40:55.420
Are you going to come on up?

00:40:55.420 --> 00:40:59.497
But remember, my ask, I
need you guys to be leaders.

00:40:59.497 --> 00:41:00.580
I need you to think of it.

00:41:00.580 --> 00:41:07.160
Don't shy away from stepping
up and being leaders.

00:41:07.160 --> 00:41:10.052
[APPLAUSE]

00:41:14.164 --> 00:41:15.580
THERON TINGSTAD:
We just have time

00:41:15.580 --> 00:41:18.509
here for about one question
for the film piece.

00:41:18.509 --> 00:41:20.050
So I wanted to ask
you, you mentioned

00:41:20.050 --> 00:41:23.980
that the average age on the
Santa Fe was 27 years old.

00:41:23.980 --> 00:41:25.570
The average age
on our sales floor

00:41:25.570 --> 00:41:31.020
here if you average in people
like me is about 27 years old.

00:41:31.020 --> 00:41:33.610
So I skew the average
up a little bit.

00:41:33.610 --> 00:41:36.491
The tech industry on
the whole skews younger.

00:41:36.491 --> 00:41:38.740
Do you feel that there are,
you mentioned millennials,

00:41:38.740 --> 00:41:41.230
do you feel that there are
generational differences as far

00:41:41.230 --> 00:41:45.160
as how the leadership
philosophy should be applied.

00:41:45.160 --> 00:41:46.840
Actually, no.

00:41:46.840 --> 00:41:50.080
I think just like all these
myths there's another myth.

00:41:50.080 --> 00:41:51.940
One of the myths
is millennials are

00:41:51.940 --> 00:41:54.280
different than
everybody else, somehow

00:41:54.280 --> 00:41:58.275
they're aliens or weird.

00:41:58.275 --> 00:42:00.400
So I have three kids,
they're all in their 20s now.

00:42:00.400 --> 00:42:02.020
So they're all millennials.

00:42:02.020 --> 00:42:06.610
So I speak a little millennial.

00:42:06.610 --> 00:42:07.480
Here's what I think.

00:42:07.480 --> 00:42:09.622
I think millennials are
just like our parents

00:42:09.622 --> 00:42:11.830
and our grandparents and
our great great grandparents

00:42:11.830 --> 00:42:14.680
in terms of their
genetic wiring and what

00:42:14.680 --> 00:42:16.390
they want as human beings.

00:42:16.390 --> 00:42:19.300
What I think has changed
is that the ability

00:42:19.300 --> 00:42:23.290
to say this job isn't
worth being treated badly

00:42:23.290 --> 00:42:24.187
has changed.

00:42:24.187 --> 00:42:26.020
In the United States,
when I was growing up,

00:42:26.020 --> 00:42:28.670
the average new house
was 1,500 square feet.

00:42:28.670 --> 00:42:31.700
The average new house size
today is 2,500 square feet.

00:42:31.700 --> 00:42:35.350
The average family size in
household went from 2.5 to 1.5.

00:42:35.350 --> 00:42:38.080
I grew up in a family of four.

00:42:38.080 --> 00:42:40.510
I couldn't wait to
get out of there.

00:42:40.510 --> 00:42:43.540
Now it's changed a little bit.

00:42:43.540 --> 00:42:49.480
So I would have put up
with any amount of pain

00:42:49.480 --> 00:42:52.920
to be gone and be out on my own.

00:42:52.920 --> 00:42:55.330
Now it's different, because
there's not so much pain back

00:42:55.330 --> 00:42:57.790
home, which I think is awesome.

00:42:57.790 --> 00:43:01.040
So my deal is the way that
millennials are saying,

00:43:01.040 --> 00:43:03.824
look, I want a job that matters.

00:43:03.824 --> 00:43:04.740
I want to feel valued.

00:43:04.740 --> 00:43:05.906
I want to be part of a team.

00:43:05.906 --> 00:43:08.230
I want some degree of control
over when and how I work

00:43:08.230 --> 00:43:09.340
and what I work on.

00:43:09.340 --> 00:43:12.350
That's how we should
treat everyone.

00:43:12.350 --> 00:43:17.660
So they're just telling us
how we should treat everybody.

00:43:17.660 --> 00:43:19.160
THERON TINGSTAD:
Well, I just wanted

00:43:19.160 --> 00:43:22.730
to thank Captain Marquet
for coming here today.

00:43:22.730 --> 00:43:24.950
Please feel free to
come up and ask him

00:43:24.950 --> 00:43:26.340
some questions in person here.

00:43:26.340 --> 00:43:29.570
But as far as the film portion.

00:43:29.570 --> 00:43:31.280
Again, Captain David
Marquet, author

00:43:31.280 --> 00:43:33.080
of "Turn the Ship Around."

00:43:33.080 --> 00:43:37.130
Featured by Steven Covey on
just an incredible example

00:43:37.130 --> 00:43:39.770
of leadership in what
he's done and what

00:43:39.770 --> 00:43:42.170
he continues to do with
companies around the world.

00:43:42.170 --> 00:43:43.790
Thank you so much
for coming today.

00:43:43.790 --> 00:43:45.706
DAVID MARQUET: Thanks
everyone for coming out.

00:43:45.706 --> 00:43:48.340
