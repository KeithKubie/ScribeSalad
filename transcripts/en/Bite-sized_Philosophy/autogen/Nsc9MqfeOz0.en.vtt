I came upon a paragraph in his chapter
on scholars that really really bothered

00:00:18.769 --> 00:00:18.779
on scholars that really really bothered
 

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:20.300
on scholars that really really bothered
me and it actually bothers me to this

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:20.310
me and it actually bothers me to this
 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:23.210

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:23.220
day he talked about this kind of person
 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:26.060
day he talked about this kind of person
like they were just a mirror-like they

of information that they took on and

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:33.270
of information that they took on and
 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:35.150
of information that they took on and
that all they ever were was just an

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:35.160
that all they ever were was just an
 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:36.740
that all they ever were was just an
instrument they were just a mirror on

reflecting what they had learned never
actually having generated anything on

actually having generated anything on
 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:43.100
actually having generated anything on
their own and it's it's bothered me

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:43.110
their own and it's it's bothered me
 

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:44.750
their own and it's it's bothered me
because I feel like in a way it's sort

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:44.760
because I feel like in a way it's sort
 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:47.750
because I feel like in a way it's sort
of like it's it's it's impacted my

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:47.760
of like it's it's it's impacted my
 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:49.580
of like it's it's it's impacted my
identity a lot because I don't know how

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:49.590
identity a lot because I don't know how
 

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:52.189
identity a lot because I don't know how
are you supposed to create something you

00:00:52.189 --> 00:00:52.199
are you supposed to create something you
 

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:52.939
are you supposed to create something you
know

00:00:52.939 --> 00:00:52.949
know
 

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:54.740
know
okay well that's okay that that's a

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:54.750
okay well that's okay that that's a
 

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:57.200
okay well that's okay that that's a
really good question I mean Nietzsche is

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:57.210
really good question I mean Nietzsche is
 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:00:59.150
really good question I mean Nietzsche is
often classed with the existentialists

00:00:59.150 --> 00:00:59.160
often classed with the existentialists
 

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:01.310
often classed with the existentialists
right and so one of the tenants of

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:01.320
right and so one of the tenants of
 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:03.290
right and so one of the tenants of
existentialist there's two real tenants

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:03.300
existentialist there's two real tenants
 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:05.899
existentialist there's two real tenants
of existentialism there's more but

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:05.909
of existentialism there's more but
 

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:08.660
of existentialism there's more but
obviously we're oversimplifying but one

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:08.670
obviously we're oversimplifying but one
 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:11.330
obviously we're oversimplifying but one
is that life is a problem it isn't

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:11.340
is that life is a problem it isn't
 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:13.090
is that life is a problem it isn't
because there's something wrong with you

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:13.100
because there's something wrong with you
 

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:16.249
because there's something wrong with you
it's that life is a problem and so

00:01:16.249 --> 00:01:16.259
it's that life is a problem and so
 

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:17.870
it's that life is a problem and so
that's often contrasted with the

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:17.880
that's often contrasted with the
 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:20.300
that's often contrasted with the
Freudian view which is that if you have

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:20.310
Freudian view which is that if you have
 

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:22.219
Freudian view which is that if you have
a problem it's because something went

00:01:22.219 --> 00:01:22.229
a problem it's because something went
 

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:24.260
a problem it's because something went
wrong during your development the

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:24.270
wrong during your development the
 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:27.649
wrong during your development the
existentialist said no no it's like life

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:27.659
existentialist said no no it's like life
 

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:29.600
existentialist said no no it's like life
is a problem make no mistake about it

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:29.610
is a problem make no mistake about it
 

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:38.740
is a problem make no mistake about it
and that

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:38.750
 

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:43.069
the purpose of the purpose of

00:01:43.069 --> 00:01:43.079
the purpose of the purpose of
 

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:45.050
the purpose of the purpose of
scholarship is in some sense to solve

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:45.060
scholarship is in some sense to solve
 

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:48.950
scholarship is in some sense to solve
that problem and so for Nietzsche like

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:48.960
that problem and so for Nietzsche like
 

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:50.929
that problem and so for Nietzsche like
he said all truths are bloody truth to

00:01:50.929 --> 00:01:50.939
he said all truths are bloody truth to
 

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:54.109
he said all truths are bloody truth to
me and what he meant by that was that if

00:01:54.109 --> 00:01:54.119
me and what he meant by that was that if
 

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:57.139
me and what he meant by that was that if
an idea didn't incarnate itself in you

00:01:57.139 --> 00:01:57.149
an idea didn't incarnate itself in you
 

00:01:57.149 --> 00:01:59.600
an idea didn't incarnate itself in you
and transform your perceptions and your

00:01:59.600 --> 00:01:59.610
and transform your perceptions and your
 

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:01.910
and transform your perceptions and your
actions then you were merely possessed

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:01.920
actions then you were merely possessed
 

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:03.169
actions then you were merely possessed
by the idea you were merely a

00:02:03.169 --> 00:02:03.179
by the idea you were merely a
 

00:02:03.179 --> 00:02:05.749
by the idea you were merely a
spokesperson for the idea or you could

00:02:05.749 --> 00:02:05.759
spokesperson for the idea or you could
 

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:07.730
spokesperson for the idea or you could
say that the idea possessed you you're a

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:07.740
say that the idea possessed you you're a
 

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:11.809
say that the idea possessed you you're a
puppet for the idea it's not you it's

00:02:11.809 --> 00:02:11.819
puppet for the idea it's not you it's
 

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:14.539
puppet for the idea it's not you it's
the idea is in you and it has you you

00:02:14.539 --> 00:02:14.549
the idea is in you and it has you you
 

00:02:14.549 --> 00:02:16.580
the idea is in you and it has you you
haven't taken the idea and incorporated

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:16.590
haven't taken the idea and incorporated
 

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:18.050
haven't taken the idea and incorporated
with you and made it part of your life

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:18.060
with you and made it part of your life
 

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:21.050
with you and made it part of your life
and so there's a romanticism that's

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:21.060
and so there's a romanticism that's
 

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:22.670
and so there's a romanticism that's
associated with that right that's the

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:22.680
associated with that right that's the
 

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:25.069
associated with that right that's the
passionate scholar the person for whom

00:02:25.069 --> 00:02:25.079
passionate scholar the person for whom
 

00:02:25.079 --> 00:02:29.119
passionate scholar the person for whom
ideas are not merely they're not merely

00:02:29.119 --> 00:02:29.129
ideas are not merely they're not merely
 

00:02:29.129 --> 00:02:32.110
ideas are not merely they're not merely
what would you call abstracted

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:32.120
what would you call abstracted
 

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:34.850
what would you call abstracted
representations that can be tossed about

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:34.860
representations that can be tossed about
 

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:38.300
representations that can be tossed about
as if they're commodities they're

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:38.310
as if they're commodities they're
 

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:40.339
as if they're commodities they're
they're they're more like pert they're

they're they're more like pert they're
 

00:02:40.349 --> 00:02:41.809
they're they're more like pert they're
more like personalities that might be

00:02:41.809 --> 00:02:41.819
more like personalities that might be
 

00:02:41.819 --> 00:02:44.979
more like personalities that might be
another way of thinking about it and so

00:02:44.979 --> 00:02:44.989
another way of thinking about it and so
 

00:02:44.989 --> 00:02:48.110
another way of thinking about it and so
if you're if if those ideas are

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:48.120
if you're if if those ideas are
 

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:52.099
if you're if if those ideas are
compelling then you don't like one thing

00:02:52.099 --> 00:02:52.109
compelling then you don't like one thing
 

00:02:52.109 --> 00:02:54.440
compelling then you don't like one thing
I learned a long time ago and I think

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:54.450
I learned a long time ago and I think
 

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:56.750
I learned a long time ago and I think
this is probably relevant I know when I

00:02:56.750 --> 00:02:56.760
this is probably relevant I know when I
 

00:02:56.760 --> 00:02:59.360
this is probably relevant I know when I
was a kid I liked to argue and I liked

00:02:59.360 --> 00:02:59.370
was a kid I liked to argue and I liked
 

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:02.150
was a kid I liked to argue and I liked
to win arguments or or or lose them

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:02.160
to win arguments or or or lose them
 

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:03.470
to win arguments or or or lose them
although I liked winning them a lot

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:03.480
although I liked winning them a lot
 

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:06.080
although I liked winning them a lot
better but I didn't really mind so much

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:06.090
better but I didn't really mind so much
 

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:08.870
better but I didn't really mind so much
what the content of the argument was you

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:08.880
what the content of the argument was you
 

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:11.120
what the content of the argument was you
know I could engage in it like a

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:11.130
know I could engage in it like a
 

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:13.849
know I could engage in it like a
sparring match and it was in some sense

00:03:13.849 --> 00:03:13.859
sparring match and it was in some sense
 

00:03:13.859 --> 00:03:15.500
sparring match and it was in some sense
to establish dominance right to

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:15.510
to establish dominance right to
 

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:17.420
to establish dominance right to
establish intellectual dominance I quit

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:17.430
establish intellectual dominance I quit
 

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:19.120
establish intellectual dominance I quit
doing that when I was in my mid-20s

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:19.130
doing that when I was in my mid-20s
 

00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:23.180
doing that when I was in my mid-20s
because I thought that that was too

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:23.190
because I thought that that was too
 

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:25.370
because I thought that that was too
shallow an approach to the ideas they

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:25.380
shallow an approach to the ideas they
 

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:29.479
shallow an approach to the ideas they
they're not commodities of that sort

00:03:29.479 --> 00:03:29.489
they're not commodities of that sort
 

00:03:29.489 --> 00:03:32.300
they're not commodities of that sort
they're there they have tendrils that

00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:32.310
they're there they have tendrils that
 

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:34.460
they're there they have tendrils that
reach down into the living that's the

00:03:34.460 --> 00:03:34.470
reach down into the living that's the
 

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:36.319
reach down into the living that's the
right way to think about it and so

00:03:36.319 --> 00:03:36.329
right way to think about it and so
 

00:03:36.329 --> 00:03:38.390
right way to think about it and so
Nietzsche's criticism of scholars and he

00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:38.400
Nietzsche's criticism of scholars and he
 

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:41.030
Nietzsche's criticism of scholars and he
did this a lot was that they were

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:41.040
did this a lot was that they were
 

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:43.789
did this a lot was that they were
bloodless you know they didn't they were

00:03:43.789 --> 00:03:43.799
bloodless you know they didn't they were
 

00:03:43.799 --> 00:03:45.740
bloodless you know they didn't they were
full of performative contradictions

00:03:45.740 --> 00:03:45.750
full of performative contradictions
 

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:46.910
full of performative contradictions
that's another way of thinking about

00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:46.920
that's another way of thinking about

what that means is they haven't taken

00:04:44.090 --> 00:04:44.100
what that means is they haven't taken
 

00:04:44.100 --> 00:04:46.219
what that means is they haven't taken
the ideas and integrated them into their

00:04:46.219 --> 00:04:46.229

a sense they haven't incarnated the

little tiny midget with a gigantic ear
and so he's a hyper specialist right and

00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:17.370
and so he's a hyper specialist right and
 

00:05:17.370 --> 00:05:19.219
and so he's a hyper specialist right and
so he has a pretty impressive year but

00:05:19.219 --> 00:05:19.229
so he has a pretty impressive year but
 

00:05:19.229 --> 00:05:21.650
so he has a pretty impressive year but
he's only this big and that was

danger of hyperspecialization
 

00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:28.159

hyperspecialization
 

00:05:29.370 --> 00:05:31.670
hyperspecialization
and and because he thought about it as a

00:05:31.670 --> 00:05:31.680
and and because he thought about it as a
 

00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:32.900

kind of deformity

00:05:32.900 --> 00:05:32.910
kind of deformity
 

00:05:32.910 --> 00:05:38.260
kind of deformity
now Nietzsche was a pretty harsh guy but

00:05:38.260 --> 00:05:38.270
 

00:05:38.270 --> 00:05:40.790
but he did address the issue of the

but he did address the issue of the
 

00:05:40.800 --> 00:05:43.100
but he did address the issue of the
relationship between intellectual

00:05:43.100 --> 00:05:43.110
relationship between intellectual
 

00:05:43.110 --> 00:05:45.680

those things are not to be separated in
 

00:05:48.389 --> 00:05:52.969
those things are not to be separated in
some sense so yes so maybe I don't know

00:05:52.969 --> 00:05:52.979
some sense so yes so maybe I don't know

some sense so yes so maybe I don't know
why it maybe it bothered you like it's

why it maybe it bothered you like it's
 

00:05:56.820 --> 00:05:58.760
why it maybe it bothered you like it's
hard to say why I bothered you it might

00:05:58.760 --> 00:05:58.770
hard to say why I bothered you it might
 

00:05:58.770 --> 00:06:00.440
hard to say why I bothered you it might
have bothered you because it's sort of

00:06:00.440 --> 00:06:00.450
have bothered you because it's sort of
 

00:06:00.450 --> 00:06:02.750
have bothered you because it's sort of
undermined the idea of scholar but the

undermined the idea of scholar but the
 

00:06:02.760 --> 00:06:04.130
undermined the idea of scholar but the
other possibility and this isn't an

00:06:04.130 --> 00:06:04.140
other possibility and this isn't an
 

00:06:04.140 --> 00:06:05.250
other possibility and this isn't an
accusation because

00:06:05.250 --> 00:06:05.260
accusation because
 

00:06:05.260 --> 00:06:06.240
accusation because
obviously I don't know anything about

00:06:06.240 --> 00:06:06.250
obviously I don't know anything about
 

00:06:06.250 --> 00:06:08.640
obviously I don't know anything about
you but it might also be that it struck

00:06:08.640 --> 00:06:08.650
you but it might also be that it struck
 

00:06:08.650 --> 00:06:11.280
you but it might also be that it struck
a chord you know and that maybe you were

00:06:11.280 --> 00:06:11.290
a chord you know and that maybe you were
 

00:06:11.290 --> 00:06:14.900
a chord you know and that maybe you were
doubtful or questioning how tightly

00:06:14.900 --> 00:06:14.910

mean that's a really good thing to think

00:06:27.390 --> 00:06:27.400
mean that's a really good thing to think
 

00:06:27.400 --> 00:06:29.400
mean that's a really good thing to think
about because generally speaking that

00:06:29.400 --> 00:06:29.410
