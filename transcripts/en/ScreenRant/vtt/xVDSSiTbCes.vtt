00:00:03.620 --> 00:00:07.720
Since casting is such an integral part of
any film, directors will typically hold auditions

00:00:07.720 --> 00:00:08.720
for key roles.

00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:12.309
This means that even some of the biggest stars
in the industry have to try out before they

00:00:12.309 --> 00:00:15.480
sign on for a project – regardless of how
talented they are.

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:17.660
Sometimes, these screen tests don’t always
go so well.

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:21.590
It doesn’t matter if the thespian in question
has won numerous awards throughout their career;

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:24.970
there’s always a chance they’re just not
the best fit for a certain role.

00:00:24.970 --> 00:00:26.440
And they find that hard the hard way.

00:00:26.440 --> 00:00:29.760
Here are 10 talented actors with the scariest
audition stories.

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:34.390
Eddie Redmayne

00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:38.660
Eddie Redmayne has received an Oscar for playing
Steven Hawking and is now a part of J.K.

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:42.910
Rowling’s famed wizarding world, but there
is one thing we know he can’t do: be a villain

00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:44.300
in a Star Wars film.

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:47.859
Redmayne was one of the actors who read for
Kylo Ren during pre-production on The Force

00:00:47.859 --> 00:00:50.550
Awakens, and it’s safe to say he bombed
his audition.

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:55.030
Due to the secrecy of the project, Redmayne
was reciting lines from other movies and only

00:00:55.030 --> 00:00:57.129
knew his would-be character was a bad guy.

00:00:57.129 --> 00:01:01.840
He started doing a poor Darth Vader impression
and spoke in a funny voice, which didn’t

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:03.489
win over the casting directors.

00:01:03.489 --> 00:01:04.930
At least he has Newt Scamander.

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:06.430
Aaron Paul

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:10.790
The Breaking Bad star had a minor role in
J.J. Abrams’ Mission: Impossible 3, so it’s

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:14.580
no surprise he met with the filmmaker again
while Abrams was working on Cloverfield.

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:18.120
When Paul arrived for the audition, Abrams
had the actor tell a story of a cool card

00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:22.890
trick he performed during M:I 3, which caused
Paul to lose his train of thought.

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:26.170
Instead of delivering a three-page monologue
he memorized, Paul had to stop in the middle

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:27.910
of it and apologize.

00:01:27.910 --> 00:01:29.920
All Abrams said was ‘That’s OK.

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:32.350
Thanks for coming in.’ and Paul left without
the part.

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:35.780
But shortly after he became Jesse Pinkman,
so it all worked out.

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:37.320
Blake Lively

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:41.410
Lively looked to make movies at a very young
age, trying out for the hit comedy Mrs. Doubtfire

00:01:41.410 --> 00:01:43.230
when she was just 5-years old.

00:01:43.230 --> 00:01:48.590
Blake’s mom didn’t want her daughter to
get star struck by Robin Williams, so she

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:51.420
told Blake that she’d be reading with the
comedian’s twin brother.

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:56.560
When Lively walked in, the filmmakers introduced
her to the one and only Robin Williams, and

00:01:56.560 --> 00:01:58.740
Blake’s response was, “You’re not his
twin?”

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:01.070
You can probably guess how things went after
that.

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:05.000
When Blake came out of the room, she told
mom that Williams had morning breath and moved

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:06.000
on.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:13.520
Now that Lively is a successful actress, she
can laugh about that mishap.

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:14.520
Chris Evans

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:19.299
These days, people are in awe to meet Captain
America, but prior to the actor’s Marvel

00:02:19.299 --> 00:02:20.939
days, it was the other way around.

00:02:20.939 --> 00:02:24.931
Evans met with Ben Affleck to audition for
the Boston legend’s directorial debut, Gone

00:02:24.931 --> 00:02:25.931
Baby Gone.

00:02:25.931 --> 00:02:30.709
Upon arriving, Evans became nervous and asked
Affleck if the parking spot he chose was OK.

00:02:30.709 --> 00:02:35.299
After an awkward conversation about parking
meters ensued, Evans was mortified and couldn’t

00:02:35.299 --> 00:02:36.299
wait to leave the room.

00:02:36.299 --> 00:02:40.690
He was so upset that he gave Affleck one-word
answers to any question asked and kept rocking

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:41.989
in the chair he was sitting in.

00:02:41.989 --> 00:02:45.299
Now that they’re both established superheroes,
maybe Affleck and Evans can work together

00:02:45.299 --> 00:02:46.299
one day.

00:02:46.299 --> 00:02:47.709
Chris Pine

00:02:47.709 --> 00:02:51.620
Chris Pine made a name for himself as the
new Captain Kirk in the rebooted Star Trek

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:55.780
series, but he could have had a role in a
different 2009 sci-fi blockbuster.

00:02:55.780 --> 00:03:00.280
Pine was in the running for James Cameron’s
Avatar, but his audition went horribly.

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:04.019
Recalling the experience, Pine mentioned that
he went into the room not believing in himself

00:03:04.019 --> 00:03:07.150
as he tried to picture Cameron’s ambitious
vision for the film.

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:10.680
He stopped halfway through his reading, and
the casting director was either smiling or

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:11.959
laughing at him.

00:03:11.959 --> 00:03:16.360
Neither one would be ideal, and the role of
Jake Sully eventually went to Sam Worthington.

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:21.090
Pine has led three successful Star Trek movies,
so it’s clear he’s got talent.

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:22.529
Jake Gyllenhaal

00:03:22.529 --> 00:03:26.840
Jake Gyllenhaal has emerged as a chameleon
actor capable of completing transforming himself

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:29.569
for a role, but he’s steered clear of big-budget
productions.

00:03:29.569 --> 00:03:32.920
Maybe his awful experience auditioning for
Lord of the Rings played a role in that.

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:36.969
Gyllenhaal read for Frodo, but nobody told
the actor that the character had an English

00:03:36.969 --> 00:03:39.659
accent.

00:03:39.659 --> 00:03:43.870
Gyllenhaal recited his lines in an American
accent, which didn’t please Peter Jackson.

00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:47.739
The director told Gyllenhaal to fire his agents
and felt it was one of the worst auditions

00:03:47.739 --> 00:03:48.739
he’d seen.

00:03:48.739 --> 00:03:52.450
This is why it’s always best to prepare
as much as possible, a lesson Gyllenhaal seems

00:03:52.450 --> 00:03:56.889
to have learned.

00:03:56.889 --> 00:03:58.779
Leonardo DiCaprio

00:03:58.779 --> 00:04:03.719
Leo has played everything from a sleazy stockbroker
to a dream thief to a vicious slave owner

00:04:03.719 --> 00:04:06.739
in his career, so there’s very little he
can’t do.

00:04:06.739 --> 00:04:11.690
Director Baz Luhrmann discovered one limitation
of DiCaprio while casting Moulin Rouge: singing.

00:04:11.690 --> 00:04:16.169
Leo admitted he feels he has a horrible singing
voice, but tried out for the musical anyway.

00:04:16.169 --> 00:04:19.730
Luhrmann played piano while DiCaprio sang
a tune, and when the Oscar winner reached

00:04:19.730 --> 00:04:23.470
a high note, Luhrmann stopped and said, “I
don’t know if this conversation should continue.”

00:04:23.470 --> 00:04:28.580
Leo has acted in numerous genres, but this
is one he probably won’t audition for again.

00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:30.520
Some people just aren’t cut out for singing.

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:31.900
Bradley Cooper

00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:36.080
Bradley Cooper quickly rose to the top of
the A-list thanks to a trio of Oscar nominated

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:40.020
performances that made him an awards season
mainstay, but before he became a critical

00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:43.060
darling, his career could have taken a different
trajectory.

00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:46.780
Cooper was one of the names considered for
2011’s Green Lantern, but the actor didn’t

00:04:46.780 --> 00:04:48.310
really take his audition seriously.

00:04:48.310 --> 00:04:52.610
His screen test amounted to doing an impersonation
of Christian Bale’s gravely voiced Batman,

00:04:52.610 --> 00:04:54.870
when the casting people wanted him to just
talk normally.

00:04:54.870 --> 00:04:57.740
Cooper didn’t get the role, and that turned
out to be a bullet dodged.

00:04:57.740 --> 00:05:02.180
Now, we’re just wondering when he’ll win
his Academy Award instead of how he’ll recover

00:05:02.180 --> 00:05:03.180
from a flop.

00:05:03.180 --> 00:05:04.180
Daniel Radcliffe

00:05:04.180 --> 00:05:07.770
You know the old saying, “if you don’t
have anything nice to say, don’t say it?”

00:05:07.770 --> 00:05:11.180
Even a kind-hearted hero like Harry Potter
forgets that sometimes.

00:05:11.180 --> 00:05:14.919
While in an audition, Daniel Radcliffe was
gossiping about somebody when another person

00:05:14.919 --> 00:05:16.150
came walking in the room.

00:05:16.150 --> 00:05:19.750
Radcliffe continued his story and when he
finished, he came to the sobering realization

00:05:19.750 --> 00:05:23.371
that the person he was talking about was a
good friend of who Radcliffe had to audition

00:05:23.371 --> 00:05:24.371
for.

00:05:24.371 --> 00:05:27.430
We don’t know which movie this was, but
it’s safe to say it’s not a project on

00:05:27.430 --> 00:05:28.950
the actor’s IMDb page.

00:05:28.950 --> 00:05:30.061
Talk about an awkward situation.

00:05:30.061 --> 00:05:31.061
Channing Tatum

00:05:31.061 --> 00:05:32.061
Channing Tatum has gone from a pretty boy
to a go-to actor who has worked with respected

00:05:32.061 --> 00:05:33.061
auteurs like Steven Soderbergh, Quentin Tarantino,
and the Coen brothers, but he had a rocky

00:05:33.061 --> 00:05:34.061
journey to the top.

00:05:34.061 --> 00:05:35.061
Earlier in his career, Tatum auditioned for
a role in Fast and Furious: Tokyo Drift, but

00:05:35.061 --> 00:05:36.061
he forgot the most important lesson: remember
your lines.

00:05:36.061 --> 00:05:37.061
Yes.

00:05:37.061 --> 00:05:38.061
Tatum could not remember the dialogue he was
supposed to say during the screen test and

00:05:38.061 --> 00:05:39.061
ended up freaking out and sweating profusely.

00:05:39.061 --> 00:05:40.061
He obviously didn’t get that part, but he
managed to turn things around down the road

00:05:40.061 --> 00:05:41.061
and become a Hollywood leading man.

00:05:41.061 --> 00:05:42.061
Chloe Grace-Moretz

00:05:42.061 --> 00:05:43.061
The legendary Martin Scorsese is a director
every actor dreams of working with, and when

00:05:43.061 --> 00:05:45.940
auditioning for him, there’s no limits to
what people will attempt to get in his favor.

00:05:45.940 --> 00:05:49.639
When trying out for one of the lead roles
in Scorsese’s love letter to cinema Hugo,

00:05:49.639 --> 00:05:53.280
Chloe Grace-Moretz rolled the dice and told
the filmmaker a little lie.

00:05:53.280 --> 00:05:57.129
The Georgia-born actress told Marty that she
was British and tried to pass it off so she

00:05:57.129 --> 00:05:58.150
could get the part.

00:05:58.150 --> 00:06:02.360
Apparently, Chloe is good at fudging up the
truth, since Scorsese cast her in Hugo.

00:06:02.360 --> 00:06:04.780
If he was impressed, Moretz did something
right.

00:06:04.780 --> 00:06:05.780
Conclusion

00:06:05.780 --> 00:06:07.889
Those are just some of the worst audition
stories from the A-listers.

00:06:07.889 --> 00:06:08.889
Which ones did we miss?
