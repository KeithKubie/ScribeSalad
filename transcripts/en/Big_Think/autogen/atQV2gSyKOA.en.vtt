sight I see in that country the obesity
epidemic is one that's taken us a couple

00:07:14.790 --> 00:07:14.800
epidemic is one that's taken us a couple
 

00:07:14.800 --> 00:07:17.400

of decades or longer to get to it's

of decades or longer to get to it's
 

00:07:17.410 --> 00:07:20.100
of decades or longer to get to it's
multifactorial so there are lots of

00:07:20.100 --> 00:07:20.110
multifactorial so there are lots of
 

00:07:20.110 --> 00:07:22.340

similarly it's going to take us a number

similarly it's going to take us a number
 

00:07:24.910 --> 00:07:27.029

this and the perfect storm of factors
that have led to obesity include what we
