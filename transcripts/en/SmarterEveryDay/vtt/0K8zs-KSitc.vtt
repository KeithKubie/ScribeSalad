00:00:00.105 --> 00:00:01.266
Hey it's me Destin

00:00:01.266 --> 00:00:02.833
welcome back to Smarter Every Day.

00:00:02.833 --> 00:00:07.896
I am in Chicago. Anthony picked me up in his awesome mustang

00:00:07.896 --> 00:00:10.033
and told me to come to this building

00:00:10.033 --> 00:00:12.533
because we're gonna film acoustic levitation.

00:00:12.533 --> 00:00:14.168
What, is this?

00:00:14.168 --> 00:00:15.753
- This is an acoustic levitator

00:00:15.753 --> 00:00:20.059
It's single axis, which means that we only control things on one axis here.

00:00:20.059 --> 00:00:23.401
So we have two horns or transducers..

00:00:23.401 --> 00:00:25.900
- Any time I see an oscilloscope I get excited.

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:27.286
So am I gonna hear it on the camera?

00:00:27.286 --> 00:00:30.591
- You'll.. so the main frequency we're using again is 22kHz

00:00:30.591 --> 00:00:32.419
which is higher than human hearing.

00:00:32.419 --> 00:00:35.271
What you'll be hearing are sub-harmonic around 17-18kHz.

00:00:35.271 --> 00:00:38.230
- But I can just put a low pass filter on the audio and I can..

00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:39.159
- I'm guessing that you cut it out, yeah.

00:00:39.159 --> 00:00:39.545
- OK

00:00:39.545 --> 00:00:42.531
- Turn it up.. And on the oscilloscope you'll see

00:00:42.531 --> 00:00:45.321
the two waves from each of the two horns. [high pitched erratic noise]

00:00:45.481 --> 00:00:47.213
- Well let's stinking levitate something dude.

00:00:47.213 --> 00:00:48.813
- Yeah, so that's just a Styrofoam ball.

00:00:48.813 --> 00:00:53.083
And the spoon has all those slots and so sound passes right through it.

00:00:53.083 --> 00:00:56.654
- No way. And by sound you mean pressure.

00:00:56.654 --> 00:00:59.522
- Yeah the sound waves, which are pressure waves I mean.

00:00:59.522 --> 00:01:02.495
But you can see the wave length spacing basically between these.

00:01:04.945 --> 00:01:06.110
- That's stinking awesome.

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:07.723
You may have seen sound drawn like this.

00:01:07.723 --> 00:01:09.303
But it's a bit too simplified.

00:01:09.303 --> 00:01:11.873
A real sound wave actually looks like this.

00:01:11.873 --> 00:01:14.812
The bright parts are the higher pressure and the darker parts are the low pressure.

00:01:14.812 --> 00:01:17.247
These ripples move along at the speed of sound.

00:01:17.247 --> 00:01:20.604
When you have two identical sound waves and you line them up just right

00:01:20.604 --> 00:01:23.179
they no longer act like waves moving across the room.

00:01:23.179 --> 00:01:24.681
If you have a wave coming from this side,

00:01:24.681 --> 00:01:26.412
and another wave coming from the other side,

00:01:26.412 --> 00:01:28.610
they become what's called a standing wave.

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:31.424
You get a spot right here where there's a pressure flipping on and off,

00:01:31.424 --> 00:01:34.259
and a spot right here where the pressure isn't changing at all,

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:35.561
there's no oscillation.

00:01:35.561 --> 00:01:39.796
If you flip this thing upright, and then you put something tiny right inside that little pocket,

00:01:39.796 --> 00:01:44.012
you can use that air pressure to bump something up against the force of gravity.

00:01:44.012 --> 00:01:45.907
So it ends up looking like this ping pong paddle.

00:01:45.907 --> 00:01:48.467
The particle wants to drop but it keeps getting knocked back up

00:01:48.467 --> 00:01:50.013
by the high pressure wave below it.

00:01:50.013 --> 00:01:52.881
And that is acoustic levitation.

00:01:52.881 --> 00:01:55.142
So if it works with foam it should work with water, right?

00:01:55.142 --> 00:02:00.008
Anthony uses a syringe to balance little drops of water on top of that oscillating wave.

00:02:00.008 --> 00:02:02.614
Just like the ping pong ball you can see it bouncing up and down.

00:02:02.614 --> 00:02:05.456
Look at the one on the bottom, bouncing up and down trying to find its spot.

00:02:05.456 --> 00:02:08.394
Another cool thing is the fact that if I make the water drops too big

00:02:08.394 --> 00:02:09.882
they always seem to explode.

00:02:09.882 --> 00:02:11.060
Why would it do that?

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:13.631
It happens just a little too fast to see with the naked eye.

00:02:13.631 --> 00:02:18.702
I flew home wishing I had some way of bringing together the acoustic levitation machine and a high speed camera.

00:02:18.702 --> 00:02:19.838
Ten months went by.

00:02:19.838 --> 00:02:23.093
I had no way of doing this, but then I got a call from Ford.

00:02:23.093 --> 00:02:27.363
They wanted to know if I could do any sound experiments on American Idol out in Hollywood.

00:02:27.363 --> 00:02:30.937
We have two hours with the most amazing setup I've ever worked with,

00:02:30.937 --> 00:02:36.452
an ultrasonic levitation device and two really fast high speed cameras.

00:02:36.452 --> 00:02:40.225
We're gonna do 20,000 frames per second with the V2511

00:02:40.225 --> 00:02:43.527
and we're gonna do 7,500 frames per second with the V711.

00:02:43.527 --> 00:02:45.431
I didn't want to just make a TV segment.

00:02:45.431 --> 00:02:49.094
I actually wanted to hang out with these guys and teach them something new about sound.

00:02:49.094 --> 00:02:50.071
- Hi I'm Jax.

00:02:50.071 --> 00:02:50.878
- I'm Rayvon.

00:02:50.878 --> 00:02:51.878
- I'm Clark.

00:02:51.878 --> 00:02:52.613
- I'm Tyanna

00:02:52.613 --> 00:02:53.449
- I'm Nick.

00:02:53.449 --> 00:02:56.134
- Alright, so we're not gonna pretend like these guys don't know what's up

00:02:56.134 --> 00:02:58.170
because we've already done a segment and they're actually..

00:02:58.170 --> 00:02:59.574
You know how this works now right?

00:02:59.574 --> 00:03:00.579
- Yeah. [all agree]

00:03:00.579 --> 00:03:03.613
- OK. Come over here and let's show everybody how it works.

00:03:03.613 --> 00:03:06.014
- It looks to me like just an amp.

00:03:06.014 --> 00:03:06.925
- OK.

00:03:06.925 --> 00:03:12.156
- And when I turn up the amplitude, sound waves through the horns

00:03:12.156 --> 00:03:15.928
will come down against each other and will make a column

00:03:15.928 --> 00:03:21.332
where you can actually suspend liquid or things of physical..

00:03:21.332 --> 00:03:24.805
- [laughter] Yes, that's right, that's right.

00:03:24.805 --> 00:03:25.603
(Destin) Did he get it right?

00:03:25.603 --> 00:03:26.437
- I think he did.

00:03:26.437 --> 00:03:29.712
- There's an equation that dictates how big a raindrop can be, OK.

00:03:29.712 --> 00:03:33.185
So the pressure that's on the inside of the drop is determined by two times

00:03:33.185 --> 00:03:36.285
the surface tension divided by the radius.

00:03:36.285 --> 00:03:37.813
If the drop gets too big, what happens?

00:03:37.813 --> 00:03:39.348
- It explodes.

00:03:39.348 --> 00:03:42.965
- It explodes. We're recording high speed video of these drops that we're levitating,

00:03:42.965 --> 00:03:45.353
and then we're ramping up the amplitude

00:03:45.353 --> 00:03:48.659
which is the same as changing the pressure, right?

00:03:48.659 --> 00:03:51.363
So once we do that, the pressure gets so great

00:03:51.363 --> 00:03:54.267
that the surface tension can't hold the drop together any more

00:03:54.267 --> 00:03:55.856
and then it just ruptures.

00:03:55.856 --> 00:03:58.958
It overcomes that internal pressure and you get an explosion.

00:03:58.958 --> 00:04:01.643
[music]

00:05:45.779 --> 00:05:47.892
Alright I hope you enjoyed this episode of Smarter Every Day.

00:05:47.892 --> 00:05:50.443
I'm not obligated to say anything about any product

00:05:50.443 --> 00:05:53.908
but Ford was awesome, seriously, they let me do awesome science

00:05:53.908 --> 00:05:56.191
on national TV and they made all that happen.

00:05:56.191 --> 00:05:57.858
So thank you very much Ford, I appreciate that.

00:05:57.858 --> 00:06:00.394
Also, I did not have to get a Ford Focus at the airport

00:06:00.394 --> 00:06:02.433
but I wanted to check it out, and I'm happy with it.

00:06:02.433 --> 00:06:03.902
So, there you go.

00:06:03.902 --> 00:06:06.360
Please support Ford. They supported Smarter Every Day.

00:06:06.360 --> 00:06:08.663
I don't have to say that. I hope you believe me.

00:06:08.663 --> 00:06:11.431

00:06:14.636 --> 00:06:16.739
I'm Destin, you're getting Smarter Every Day.

00:06:16.739 --> 00:06:17.908
Have a good one.

00:06:18.638 --> 00:06:21.071
[music]

00:06:24.750 --> 00:06:26.891
I'm with you. OK teach me something else.

00:06:26.891 --> 00:06:29.376
- So one kind of cool thing, if I put my hand under I take them all out.

00:06:29.376 --> 00:06:30.292
My hand blocks the sound.

00:06:30.292 --> 00:06:34.462
(Destin) What could you be possibly doing that's more important than acoustic levitation?

00:06:35.467 --> 00:06:36.827
