00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:00.989
So if you're anything like me,

00:00:00.989 --> 00:00:04.888
there's a good chance you got so caught up in the everyday business of life and Father's Day

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:09.149
just sprung up on you, and you're not prepared, but don't worry because I'm in the same boat, and for this video,

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:13.740
I'm going to show you a quick and easy way you can still save the day by making your dad an awesome looking shirt

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:16.590
and tie out of money. Now for this tutorial

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:20.399
I'm gonna use a $20 bill and you can see there's a light green side and a darker green side,

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:22.980
and I personally like the darker green side for my shirts,

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:27.779
it just looks a little bit more classy and if you want to do the same start with that side facing up then take the

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:29.260
bottom edge and

00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:34.500
carefully fold it up to meet the top making sure the corner is lined up, and then giving it a crease with your thumbnail.

00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:39.180
Using your thumbnail is going to make that crease really nice and solid and once you've got that set,

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:42.809
you can go ahead and open it up with the crease side facing up.

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:45.900
Let's go ahead and take the other edges and fold them into the middle.

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:50.440
[ MUSIC ]

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:54.880
Let's go ahead and flip the bill around, then take the other bottom edge and fold that up to meet the middle again.

00:00:55.080 --> 00:00:58.800
[ MUSIC ]

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:00.660
Now go ahead and unravel your bill,

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:04.889
and it should look something like this and the next step is going to be very similar to building an airplane.

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:08.939
We're going to take these top corners and fold them down into the center then use your

00:01:09.189 --> 00:01:11.519
fingernail to go ahead and crease that edge over and

00:01:11.650 --> 00:01:16.469
once that's set we're going to take the other corner and fold it down to meet the point on the other one,

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:18.930
making sure that that lines up in the middle as well,

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:24.119
and when it does we're going to crease that line to make a nice sharp triangle point.

00:01:24.759 --> 00:01:27.479
Now when you've got the top of your bill folded into a triangle,

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:29.700
we need to go ahead and crease it down the center again.

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:33.689
We're going to focus on this edge right here because that's what we're going to use to make our tie.

00:01:33.939 --> 00:01:38.249
Place one of your fingers on the inside corner of the triangle and then using the other hand,

00:01:38.799 --> 00:01:45.688
fold it gently sideways and crease it off to the sides that's about half the width that you want your final tie to be.

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:47.040
Looking at it from this angle,

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:49.319
you should kind of get an idea of how this is going to come together.

00:01:49.509 --> 00:01:53.669
Now once you've made that crease it's going to be really helpful just to flip it over and bend it back

00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:57.580
the other way, and that's just going to help make that paper a little more flexible.

00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:03.399
Unfold your bill back to the triangle position then take the bottom of the triangle and fold it inward,

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:07.330
increase it along the center now if you look very closely at the creases,

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:09.369
we just made you can see it resembles a tie

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:14.679
Now place one of your fingers on the right side of the triangle and then fold the tie in half and

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:16.330
hold that in place with your finger,

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:20.199
you can see how it makes the billfold off to the edge and we want to take your finger and

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:23.469
crease that down at that angle while we're here,

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:27.339
it's also a good idea to take this bottom corner and fold it up to the center and

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:29.510
come out to look very nice like that.

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:32.559
Now just to give you a quick replay on that this bottom corner here

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:35.529
goes up to touch the middle when we make that fold and

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:38.740
everything lines up with that fold that we made earlier.

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:42.970
Once you've got that set you can take your little tie flap and fold it back on top,

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:47.889
exposing the other side of the tie, and then we're just going to repeat that process on the other side this time

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:51.880
we're going to fold the tie in half from the other direction and use your left finger to hold that in place,

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:55.689
we're going to use the other finger just to gently smooth down the bill at the top there and

00:02:56.209 --> 00:02:59.769
once again take this corner and line it up with the center now,

00:02:59.770 --> 00:03:03.549
this really is the trickiest part so I'm going to show you one more time how it works just so you get it,

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:09.609
but this corner down here needs to end up in the middle and this line here needs to transition to go vertical.

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:15.040
So when we fold that vertically you can see how that corner transitions up to meet the top and

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:17.880
everything aligns with that side fold.

00:03:18.350 --> 00:03:21.609
Now with that second fold may we can go ahead and unfold the tie,

00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:26.110
and you should see that it sticks out on top of the shirt now. The next step is to make the collar.

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:31.359
To make the collar we want to focus on the very bottom end, take about a quarter of an inch

00:03:31.850 --> 00:03:34.029
of material and fold it straight upward,

00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:38.519
and crease it very nicely and then go ahead flip the whole thing over.

00:03:39.069 --> 00:03:42.269
This will be your pointed part at the top and the flat part at the bottom.

00:03:42.270 --> 00:03:47.309
We're going to start with this bottom right corner and fold it in at an angle so that meets the middle line and then do

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:50.250
the same thing with the left side grab the bottom right corner,

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:56.399
and just guide that corner right into the center at a bit of an angle, and this will leave you a long narrow strip.

00:03:56.950 --> 00:03:59.099
Now flip your bill over the other way then grab the

00:03:59.230 --> 00:04:03.599
left-hand corner and fold that in so that it meets the corner from the other direction,

00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:07.319
hold that in place with your finger, and then go ahead and crease it so that it matches.

00:04:08.019 --> 00:04:13.139
What this does is create the neck and the collar of the shirt, and you'll see how that comes together in just a minute but for

00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:18.959
now flip it over so that the tie side is facing back up then take this collar and fold it up so that it hangs

00:04:18.959 --> 00:04:24.629
just underneath the tie by about three millimeters or so, and crease the bottom to lock it into place.

00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:29.280
Now this next part is going to be a little bit tricky as well because it's going to be where we form the arms.

00:04:29.380 --> 00:04:33.209
We need to just tilt the collar forward so we can see this crease line on the inside,

00:04:33.700 --> 00:04:40.109
we're going to pull that crease line out and recrease it the opposite direction and then fold the collar back in.

00:04:40.450 --> 00:04:46.799
Now hold the collar gently in place with your thumb and grab the sleeve and gently pull it out until it's about the size that

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:51.870
you want. When it is go ahead and crease it down in place, and you've got one sleeve for your shirt done,

00:04:51.870 --> 00:04:54.090
we can move on to doing the next one the same way:

00:04:54.640 --> 00:04:57.299
gently pull the collar forward look for that crease line

00:04:58.090 --> 00:05:00.359
pull it out and pinch it, so that's the opposite direction,

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:06.479
gently replace the collar in the center with your thumb and grab that other sleeve and just pull it out until it's about

00:05:06.479 --> 00:05:11.459
where you want it, and go ahead and crease it in place, you might even want to put it down the table and just flatten everything.

00:05:12.039 --> 00:05:17.188
Make sure it's about as secure as it can get. Right now your shirt should be looking something like this,

00:05:17.189 --> 00:05:20.669
and if it is you want to flip it over and lay it down on the table with the flat side facing

00:05:20.739 --> 00:05:26.279
up and we're going to take this bottom part with the shirt sleeves and fold it up to meet the shoulders on the back of

00:05:26.279 --> 00:05:29.759
the neck here. When those two points align, crease it at the bottom

00:05:30.489 --> 00:05:35.969
to secure it, then take the collar and fold it up so that it meets the top of the shirt,

00:05:35.969 --> 00:05:39.719
but before you crease it turn the shirt over and just make sure the top of your tie

00:05:39.999 --> 00:05:44.609
lines up with the collar first, if it does then use your fingers to pinch the back of the shirt

00:05:44.649 --> 00:05:46.539
maybe put it on a table and

00:05:46.539 --> 00:05:51.928
crease it as tightly as you can and if you've done everything right the back of your shirt should look something like this. Now

00:05:52.269 --> 00:05:54.269
there's only one step left to finishing up,

00:05:54.269 --> 00:05:57.809
and that's to take the collar and fold it over and around the front of the shirt.

00:05:58.119 --> 00:06:02.759
That'll help lock it in place and hold everything together and just like that your little money shirt is done,

00:06:02.949 --> 00:06:05.609
with the three dimensional tie and little sleeves that stick out.

00:06:06.519 --> 00:06:09.419
So now you know how to turn any dollar bill into a cool-looking shirt

00:06:09.419 --> 00:06:11.669
and tie that your dad is going to love this Father's Day.

00:06:11.669 --> 00:06:17.098
And if he doesn't then don't worry about it because he can still use it to go buy himself something else. Well guys, thanks for

00:06:17.100 --> 00:06:21.680
joining me for this video, and I'll be looking for you the next one. Talk to you then, and happy Father's Day, Dad.

00:06:21.680 --> 00:06:23.680
I'm going to go put this in the mail for you right now.
