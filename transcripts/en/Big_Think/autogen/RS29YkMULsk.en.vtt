undergo certain predictable changes
which might change the the actual

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:56.070

which does don't preclude it and
sometimes just knowing what those

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:03.420
sometimes just knowing what those
 

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:05.810
sometimes just knowing what those
changes are for instance you know for

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:05.820
changes are for instance you know for
 

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:07.789
changes are for instance you know for
men just that they need to have actual

00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:07.799
men just that they need to have actual
 

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:09.770

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:13.250
thinking about things the way they might
have in the past there has to be actual

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:13.260
have in the past there has to be actual
 

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:15.230

think part of that so probably it's
 

00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:27.770
think part of that so probably it's
going to just become more prevalent that

00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:27.780
going to just become more prevalent that
 

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:30.770

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:42.420
there there are there are actually some
data that suggest that for instance men

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:42.430
data that suggest that for instance men
 

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:45.690
data that suggest that for instance men

that's I don't know how good that
 

00:04:00.849 --> 00:04:02.880
that's I don't know how good that
research data is it may very well be

00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:02.890
research data is it may very well be
 

00:04:02.890 --> 00:04:05.009
research data is it may very well be
that men who are able to have sexual

00:04:05.009 --> 00:04:05.019
that men who are able to have sexual
 

00:04:05.019 --> 00:04:07.710
that men who are able to have sexual
