00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:04.280
Social learning is a learning theory
that puts very explicit emphasis on

00:00:04.280 --> 00:00:08.280
the interaction and collaboration among
people during the learning process.

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:11.558
It was derived from Albert Bandura's
work and just like Jean Piaget

00:00:11.558 --> 00:00:15.355
suggested, that authentic experiences
are really important for developing

00:00:15.355 --> 00:00:19.096
a real understanding, or constructing
a real understanding of some topic,

00:00:19.096 --> 00:00:22.663
Bandura suggested that part of that
authenticity is the authentic social

00:00:22.663 --> 00:00:24.879
interactions that
happen during learning.

00:00:24.879 --> 00:00:26.243
That we learn together and

00:00:26.243 --> 00:00:29.282
we develop our concepts of
different material together.

00:00:29.282 --> 00:00:33.019
And it's really important to preserve
that in any learning environment, but

00:00:33.019 --> 00:00:35.460
this presents a real problem for
online learning.

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:40.360
Because in online learning,
we lose the most accessible device for

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:41.930
facilitating this kind
of social learning.

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:43.570
And that's the physical classroom.

00:00:43.570 --> 00:00:45.800
In a physical classroom we can
actually talk to one another,

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:47.320
interact face to face.

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:49.470
Online we don't have that as much.

00:00:49.470 --> 00:00:51.860
So how do we develop that for
the online environment?

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:53.220
So this really brings up two questions.

00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:57.160
First of all, how does the loss
of that physical environment,

00:00:57.160 --> 00:00:59.810
that physical classroom
impact online learning?

00:00:59.810 --> 00:01:01.350
How does it change what students learn?

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:03.270
Does it actually hurt us?

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:06.584
And secondly, how do we develop devices,
develop technologies,

00:01:06.584 --> 00:01:08.515
that can actually resolve this issue.

00:01:08.515 --> 00:01:11.689
Assuming that it does damage the
learning if we don't have access to this

00:01:11.689 --> 00:01:14.200
kind of interpersonal collaboration and
interaction?

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:17.379
Can we develop devices that
actually help alleviate that,

00:01:17.379 --> 00:01:19.740
that facilitate that interaction online?

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:22.916
Now I'm obviously very biased,
because I work on this program and

00:01:22.916 --> 00:01:23.946
I love this program.

00:01:23.946 --> 00:01:25.949
I think that with technology,

00:01:25.949 --> 00:01:30.280
not only can we develop ways
to overcome this difficulty.

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:31.730
Honestly, I think in
the online environment,

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:33.980
we can develop technologies
that make it even better.

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:36.900
One of my favorite experiences in
this program has been that, I can

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:41.170
logon to the class forum and interact
with ten students in five minutes.

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:43.237
And then come back an hour later and
do it again.

00:01:43.237 --> 00:01:44.977
And that's a level of interaction,

00:01:44.977 --> 00:01:48.465
a level of collaboration that I could
never have in a physical classroom.

00:01:48.465 --> 00:01:52.042
And so, I really think that with
the right effort and the right designs,

00:01:52.042 --> 00:01:54.975
we can create and leverage
social learning in a way online,

00:01:54.975 --> 00:01:57.520
that actually goes beyond
what we can do in person.
