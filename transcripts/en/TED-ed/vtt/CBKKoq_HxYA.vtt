00:00:07.089 --> 00:00:08.455
Just a minute ago,

00:00:08.455 --> 00:00:11.246
this oil helped make a delicious meal possible.

00:00:11.246 --> 00:00:13.794
But now, it's just some nasty goop.

00:00:13.794 --> 00:00:15.045
What should we do with it?

00:00:15.045 --> 00:00:16.329
Well, the easiest thing would be

00:00:16.329 --> 00:00:17.495
to pour it down the drain;

00:00:17.495 --> 00:00:19.495
that makes it seem like it's gone,

00:00:19.495 --> 00:00:20.579
but it's not really gone.

00:00:20.579 --> 00:00:22.913
Instead, it's collecting bits of food

00:00:22.913 --> 00:00:24.413
and other random stuff,

00:00:24.413 --> 00:00:26.639
producing monstrous, greasy blockages

00:00:26.639 --> 00:00:28.516
that clog not only your own drain

00:00:28.516 --> 00:00:30.352
but entire sewage systems,

00:00:30.352 --> 00:00:33.259
causing flooding and pollution.

00:00:33.259 --> 00:00:36.606
Many places have laws for proper disposal of grease,

00:00:36.606 --> 00:00:39.236
but we can go one step further.

00:00:39.236 --> 00:00:41.068
Instead of just throwing it away safely,

00:00:41.068 --> 00:00:43.114
we can turn it into something useful.

00:00:43.114 --> 00:00:44.176
And if you're wondering

00:00:44.176 --> 00:00:45.650
what anyone could possibly want

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:47.817
with a bunch of digusting, used cooking oil,

00:00:47.817 --> 00:00:50.067
the answer is: biodiesel.

00:00:50.067 --> 00:00:52.205
You've probably heard of diesel engines.

00:00:52.205 --> 00:00:54.567
They power farming and construction equipment,

00:00:54.567 --> 00:00:58.210
trucks, buses, ships, trains, backup generators,

00:00:58.210 --> 00:00:59.983
and even some cars.

00:00:59.983 --> 00:01:01.798
Most of the fuel that feeds these engines

00:01:01.798 --> 00:01:03.401
is refined from petroleum,

00:01:03.401 --> 00:01:05.429
which comes from long-dead dinosaurs

00:01:05.429 --> 00:01:07.263
and other ancient fossils.

00:01:07.263 --> 00:01:09.266
But diesel fuel can also be derived from

00:01:09.266 --> 00:01:10.816
more recently-dead organisms,

00:01:10.816 --> 00:01:12.269
like plants and animals.

00:01:12.269 --> 00:01:14.744
And this type of fuel is what we call biodiesel.

00:01:14.744 --> 00:01:18.106
Biodiesel is a biodegradable energy source,

00:01:18.106 --> 00:01:20.443
made from plant oils or animal fats,

00:01:20.443 --> 00:01:23.566
that can usually be burned in regular diesel engines.

00:01:23.566 --> 00:01:24.598
You guessed it,

00:01:24.598 --> 00:01:26.649
it's the 'bio' version of diesel.

00:01:26.649 --> 00:01:28.149
It's cleaner than normal diesel,

00:01:28.149 --> 00:01:30.066
so there has been a push to generate it

00:01:30.066 --> 00:01:32.039
from crops like soybeans.

00:01:32.039 --> 00:01:33.817
Now, growing plants for fuel,

00:01:33.817 --> 00:01:36.168
instead of food, comes with its own problems.

00:01:36.168 --> 00:01:40.900
But fortunately, we already have some oils and fats right here.

00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:42.483
Preparing your used cooking grease for recycling

00:01:42.483 --> 00:01:43.842
is easy.

00:01:43.842 --> 00:01:46.233
First, let it cool down to room temperature.

00:01:46.233 --> 00:01:48.484
Then, transfer it to a clean container.

00:01:48.484 --> 00:01:50.513
You can use any old bottles you have lying around,

00:01:50.513 --> 00:01:51.816
like milk jugs,

00:01:51.816 --> 00:01:53.183
as long as they're completely empty,

00:01:53.183 --> 00:01:54.815
rinsed, and dried.

00:01:54.815 --> 00:01:56.479
Use a funnel to avoid spills

00:01:56.479 --> 00:01:59.568
and a sieve to filter out any small food particles.

00:01:59.568 --> 00:02:01.026
You can even add bacon grease

00:02:01.026 --> 00:02:02.193
and other animal fats

00:02:02.193 --> 00:02:03.278
or the excess oil from canned food,

00:02:03.278 --> 00:02:05.863
like tuna or sardines,

00:02:05.863 --> 00:02:08.566
just make sure it's really oil and not brine.

00:02:08.566 --> 00:02:11.369
So, what happens now that your oil is safely contained?

00:02:11.369 --> 00:02:13.955
Well, many cities have recycling services

00:02:13.955 --> 00:02:15.817
that will pick up large amounts of grease

00:02:15.817 --> 00:02:17.874
from restaurants and other establishments.

00:02:17.874 --> 00:02:18.960
But there are locations

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:21.754
where individuals can drop off their containers, as well.

00:02:21.754 --> 00:02:24.131
All of this grease will end up at a processing plant,

00:02:24.131 --> 00:02:27.428
where it can be converted to useable biodiesel.

00:02:27.428 --> 00:02:29.173
How does this conversion work?

00:02:29.173 --> 00:02:31.722
Well, all these oils and fats you donated

00:02:31.722 --> 00:02:33.483
are made up of triglycerides,

00:02:33.483 --> 00:02:35.066
a glycerol molecule connected to

00:02:35.066 --> 00:02:37.315
three fatty acid chains.

00:02:37.315 --> 00:02:38.898
To convert fats to fuel,

00:02:38.898 --> 00:02:40.523
they react with an alcohol,

00:02:40.523 --> 00:02:42.483
usually methanol or ethanol,

00:02:42.483 --> 00:02:45.484
which produces long-chain esters and glycerol.

00:02:45.484 --> 00:02:47.484
To compare, here are some molecules

00:02:47.484 --> 00:02:49.149
of regular diesel fuel.

00:02:49.149 --> 00:02:51.483
Now, here are the molecules we created

00:02:51.483 --> 00:02:53.452
by breaking apart the triglycerides.

00:02:53.452 --> 00:02:55.317
Glycerol is the odd man out,

00:02:55.317 --> 00:02:57.816
so it's removed at the end of the process.

00:02:57.816 --> 00:02:59.500
But look at these esters!

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:01.798
If you squint, their structures look pretty similar

00:03:01.798 --> 00:03:05.590
to those of the long-chain hydrocarbons in regular diesel.

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:08.067
And diesel engines, with a few small modifications,

00:03:08.067 --> 00:03:10.567
can also be made to squint

00:03:10.567 --> 00:03:14.014
and burn these esters like regular diesel fuel.

00:03:14.014 --> 00:03:16.093
Et voila! Biodiesel.

00:03:16.093 --> 00:03:18.586
Now, you might be wondering whether all this hassle

00:03:18.586 --> 00:03:20.233
over recycling used cooking oil

00:03:20.233 --> 00:03:21.898
is even worth it.

00:03:21.898 --> 00:03:24.983
After all, how much energy can it possibly generate?

00:03:24.983 --> 00:03:28.899
Well, if all the grease that New Yorkers throw away in one day

00:03:28.899 --> 00:03:30.783
were converted to jet fuel,

00:03:30.783 --> 00:03:33.701
it would be enough to power several hundred flights

00:03:33.701 --> 00:03:35.869
from New York to Los Angeles.

00:03:35.869 --> 00:03:37.816
And let's not forget that using waste oil

00:03:37.816 --> 00:03:39.816
instead of burning more fossil fuels

00:03:39.816 --> 00:03:43.066
will limit our negative effects on the environment.

00:03:43.066 --> 00:03:44.706
Recycling used cooking grease

00:03:44.706 --> 00:03:46.529
turns goop into good.

00:03:46.529 --> 00:03:48.131
By contributing a little bit,

00:03:48.131 --> 00:03:49.969
individuals and businesses can help create

00:03:49.969 --> 00:03:52.444
an alternative, stable source of diesel oil,

00:03:52.444 --> 00:03:53.945
while protecting the environment

00:03:53.945 --> 00:03:55.682
and keeping our cities cleaner.

00:03:55.682 --> 00:03:59.682
And that's pretty slick.
