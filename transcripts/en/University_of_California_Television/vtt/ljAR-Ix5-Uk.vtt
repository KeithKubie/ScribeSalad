(click)

00:00:01.768 --> 00:00:03.935
(beeping)

00:00:09.520 --> 00:00:14.520
- Who's an assistant professor
of ophthalmology at UCSF.

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:18.910
Got her ophthalmology training
here at Boston Children's

00:00:18.910 --> 00:00:21.990
and Massachusets Eye Hospital,

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:26.990
and I first heard you
speak at the advances

00:00:28.247 --> 00:00:30.510
and pediatrics course and want to

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:33.190
thank Dr. Andrea Cello for bringing you

00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:35.510
there so we could bring you here.

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:38.207
- It's my pleasure, thank you.

00:00:38.207 --> 00:00:40.457
(applause)

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:45.130
Alright, I'm gonna set up a backup timer

00:00:45.130 --> 00:00:47.402
on my phone also, just
in case I lose sight

00:00:47.402 --> 00:00:50.100
of the green button here, but it's

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:52.830
absolutely my pleasure to
be here this afternoon,

00:00:52.830 --> 00:00:54.910
thank you so much for having me to

00:00:54.910 --> 00:00:58.310
speak to you about vision impairments,

00:00:58.310 --> 00:01:02.330
and the appropriate way
to do vision screening

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:04.620
in patients with
developmental disabilities,

00:01:04.620 --> 00:01:07.500
especially the pediatric patients

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:09.150
with developmental disabilities.

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:10.557
As I am a pediatric ophthalmologist,

00:01:10.557 --> 00:01:12.983
I will be focusing my talk mostly on that.

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:16.580
So just to begin, I have no disclosures

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:19.779
to report just yet, as an overview today,

00:01:19.779 --> 00:01:21.440
I'm going to be speaking to you first

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:22.880
about the importance of vision screening

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:25.690
in general and the impact that it has.

00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:28.160
Secondly, talking to you about the vision

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:30.110
problems that we often see in children,

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:33.870
especially those that have
developed mental disabilities.

00:01:33.870 --> 00:01:35.220
Then I'll speak to you about some

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:37.231
conventional screening tasks that we have

00:01:37.231 --> 00:01:39.624
readily available at our disposal just

00:01:39.624 --> 00:01:42.650
in our normal clinic that
I'll show you how to do,

00:01:42.650 --> 00:01:45.548
and hopefully you can implement
in your own practices.

00:01:45.548 --> 00:01:47.360
And then lastly, I'll talk to you about

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:48.900
some of the new technologies that we

00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:51.580
have for automated vision screening

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:54.410
so that you might be able to use

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:56.133
these modalities as well.

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:00.160
So to go through our learning objectives,

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:02.700
number one, to understand
the impact of vision

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:05.780
screening in children with
developmental disabilities.

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:07.890
Number two, to learn two conventional

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:09.520
methods of vision screening.

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:11.330
Three, to learn the four different

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:12.430
types of automated screenings,

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:14.490
and finally, you know, every test

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:18.360
is not without it's
pitfalls or it's negative

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:20.610
implications or it's cons,

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:22.390
and so I sort of wanna go through the pros

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:24.480
and cons in each of these different

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:25.980
modalities that you can make your

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:27.270
best informed decision about what

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:29.070
would work for you in your practice.

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:32.127
Okay, so to begin, why do we even

00:02:32.127 --> 00:02:35.130
need to perform vision screening?

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:37.760
About one in four
American school children,

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:40.070
which is a very, very high statistic,

00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:42.450
actually have some form of vision

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:44.200
disability or vision problem.

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:46.730
And then this percentage is much higher,

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:48.110
as you can imagine, in children

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:50.410
with developmental disabilities.

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:52.980
This is often due to the fact that

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:54.998
the underlying etiology that explains

00:02:54.998 --> 00:02:57.559
their developmental delay or disability

00:02:57.559 --> 00:03:00.610
can also affect the visual system,

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:04.270
so factors such as prenatal
or perinatal insults

00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:06.521
or acquired injuries can also affect

00:03:06.521 --> 00:03:10.143
the neurosensory pathway
that affects vision.

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:14.210
Patients that are developmentally delayed

00:03:14.210 --> 00:03:16.605
and also are very, very
young pediatric patients

00:03:16.605 --> 00:03:20.260
often don't realize that they
have a visual impairment,

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:21.900
or if they do, they don't have a way

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:26.030
to convey that message to their
parents or to their doctors.

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:29.260
And so it's important that
we, as the practitioners,

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:31.100
are the ones that actually
are being proactive

00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:32.673
and screening these patients.

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:36.140
And then finally, these patients,

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:38.830
when they have many other
medical comorbidities,

00:03:38.830 --> 00:03:40.330
or a lot of other things going on,

00:03:40.330 --> 00:03:43.574
parents often are often overlooking

00:03:43.574 --> 00:03:46.420
the vision impairments or the potential

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:48.175
vision disabilities that they also have

00:03:48.175 --> 00:03:50.490
just because there's so many other things

00:03:50.490 --> 00:03:51.670
that they're sort of dealing with,

00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:53.500
and many other doctor's appointments.

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:56.420
So it's really our prerogative as the

00:03:56.420 --> 00:03:57.840
pediatric ophthalmologists and as

00:03:57.840 --> 00:03:59.790
primary care doctors to be the first line

00:03:59.790 --> 00:04:01.143
of defense for these patients when

00:04:01.143 --> 00:04:02.970
it comes to vision screening,

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:04.950
and then appropriately refer it to us

00:04:04.950 --> 00:04:07.693
as the more subspecialized
care when it's needed.

00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:12.432
So visiual disabilities,
as you might guess,

00:04:12.432 --> 00:04:17.010
has a lot of impact on people's lives.

00:04:17.010 --> 00:04:20.880
Firstly, it can impact
someone's ability to learn,

00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:24.393
also their career
opportunities down the line.

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:27.390
There's a couple of studies that sort of

00:04:27.390 --> 00:04:31.460
try to quantify the actual monetary

00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:33.870
or economic burden of
unilateral vision loss,

00:04:33.870 --> 00:04:36.470
and I would probably argue that the values

00:04:36.470 --> 00:04:37.947
that are sort of mentioned
in this one paper

00:04:37.947 --> 00:04:40.850
are under-balling it a little bit.

00:04:40.850 --> 00:04:42.910
So this one paper had described

00:04:42.910 --> 00:04:45.670
unilateral vision loss by the age of ten

00:04:45.670 --> 00:04:50.670
can result in upwards of
$67,000 of cost over a lifetime,

00:04:51.190 --> 00:04:54.116
and about a 10% decrease
in quality of life.

00:04:54.116 --> 00:04:56.750
That's, I think, is the underestimate of

00:04:56.750 --> 00:04:58.090
what we can sort of imagine.

00:04:58.090 --> 00:05:00.521
Because, especially in patients that have

00:05:00.521 --> 00:05:04.520
other forms of developmental
of neurologic disability,

00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:07.330
it can impact other aspects of their life.

00:05:07.330 --> 00:05:09.760
Vision is so important in the development

00:05:09.760 --> 00:05:14.440
of motor advancement, social interaction,

00:05:14.440 --> 00:05:19.440
self care, so if there isn't
appropriate vision established,

00:05:20.030 --> 00:05:21.906
these patients sort of fall short in these

00:05:21.906 --> 00:05:25.653
other aspects of their development.

00:05:27.610 --> 00:05:29.150
So the most common vision problems

00:05:29.150 --> 00:05:31.030
that we see in all children at large,

00:05:31.030 --> 00:05:33.480
and I'll sort of go
through the specific issues

00:05:33.480 --> 00:05:35.360
that we see in patients
with developmental delay,

00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:37.230
are number one, amblyopia.

00:05:37.230 --> 00:05:38.870
So this is the one major thing that

00:05:38.870 --> 00:05:42.390
a lot of our vision screening
testing is looking for.

00:05:42.390 --> 00:05:44.680
I'll describe what amblyopia actually is

00:05:44.680 --> 00:05:46.512
in the subsequent slides, but basically,

00:05:46.512 --> 00:05:49.570
it is a failure of the development

00:05:49.570 --> 00:05:53.170
of the neurosensory pathway that allows

00:05:53.170 --> 00:05:56.800
one to see, and it's due to problems

00:05:56.800 --> 00:06:00.130
that occur during early
development that impair vision.

00:06:00.130 --> 00:06:02.300
So these risk factors
that can impair vision

00:06:02.300 --> 00:06:05.100
include a refractive
error, so needing glasses,

00:06:05.100 --> 00:06:09.360
so having a constant blur
in vision can therefore

00:06:09.360 --> 00:06:11.710
decrease the visual input
that the brain is receiving

00:06:11.710 --> 00:06:13.350
and therefore the development of

00:06:13.350 --> 00:06:15.800
that eye doesn't occur normally.

00:06:15.800 --> 00:06:19.260
Secondly, strabismus, or
misalignment of the eyes.

00:06:19.260 --> 00:06:20.869
When the eyes are not
actually working together,

00:06:20.869 --> 00:06:24.360
there is what we call
competitive inhibition.

00:06:24.360 --> 00:06:27.152
So one eye takes over as the dominant eye,

00:06:27.152 --> 00:06:30.800
leaving the other eye to
become lazy or amblyopic.

00:06:30.800 --> 00:06:32.635
And then finally, something that blocks

00:06:32.635 --> 00:06:34.780
visual input from entering into the eye,

00:06:34.780 --> 00:06:37.630
and then therefore, being
translated into the brain,

00:06:37.630 --> 00:06:39.895
such as a cataract or some
sort of a pacification

00:06:39.895 --> 00:06:43.760
in the front of the eye
can result in amblyopia.

00:06:43.760 --> 00:06:45.120
Aside from amblyopia, though,

00:06:45.120 --> 00:06:46.238
there are several other factors

00:06:46.238 --> 00:06:48.470
that can result in visual impairments.

00:06:48.470 --> 00:06:51.460
This is number one, just
needing glasses in general.

00:06:51.460 --> 00:06:53.610
Run of the mill refractive error.

00:06:53.610 --> 00:06:56.170
Number two, strabismus, or
misalignment of the eyes,

00:06:56.170 --> 00:06:58.220
doesn't necessarily need to cause

00:06:58.220 --> 00:07:00.048
a decrease in vision
in one eye or another,

00:07:00.048 --> 00:07:03.433
but it can cause a
decrease in visual ability,

00:07:06.070 --> 00:07:08.450
because it can limit depth perception.

00:07:08.450 --> 00:07:09.833
And then finally, any other structural

00:07:09.833 --> 00:07:11.453
abnormalities of the eye.

00:07:12.480 --> 00:07:15.010
So just to go through
amblyopia a little bit more,

00:07:15.010 --> 00:07:16.750
it's defined in the reduction of

00:07:16.750 --> 00:07:18.760
best-corrected visual
acuity, so this means

00:07:18.760 --> 00:07:20.657
with appropriate glasses that cannot

00:07:20.657 --> 00:07:23.760
be attributed to any structural
abnormality of the eyes.

00:07:23.760 --> 00:07:26.963
This neurosensory abnormality.

00:07:28.010 --> 00:07:29.551
It's because the brain is not receiving

00:07:29.551 --> 00:07:31.911
the normal amount of
stimuli that it should

00:07:31.911 --> 00:07:34.530
as the visual stem is developing.

00:07:34.530 --> 00:07:36.560
It's actually quite common amongst

00:07:36.560 --> 00:07:38.060
the general population of children,

00:07:38.060 --> 00:07:41.560
it's about two to 3% of the population,

00:07:41.560 --> 00:07:44.010
it is the most common
referral to my practice

00:07:44.010 --> 00:07:45.440
as a pediatric ophthalmologist,

00:07:45.440 --> 00:07:49.150
and most pediatric ophthalmology
practices at large,

00:07:49.150 --> 00:07:51.810
but this percentage I
would argue is much higher

00:07:51.810 --> 00:07:53.800
in patients with developmental delay,

00:07:53.800 --> 00:07:55.083
because these patients actually have

00:07:55.083 --> 00:07:57.770
a much higher incidence of those three

00:07:57.770 --> 00:07:59.970
risk factors that can result in amblyopia.

00:07:59.970 --> 00:08:02.007
Needing glasses, having strabismus,

00:08:02.007 --> 00:08:05.400
or having some sort of structural
abnormality of the eye.

00:08:05.400 --> 00:08:07.833
It's important that we
screen for amblyopia,

00:08:10.055 --> 00:08:11.290
and the incidence of amblyopia can

00:08:11.290 --> 00:08:16.290
actually increase by about
2.5, 2.6 fold by age eight

00:08:16.640 --> 00:08:18.270
if screening is not done by age two.

00:08:18.270 --> 00:08:20.550
So that's a substantial amount of burden

00:08:20.550 --> 00:08:21.930
that we can be decreasing by

00:08:21.930 --> 00:08:23.673
doing early screening of patients.

00:08:25.540 --> 00:08:28.160
And why do we wanna screen
for amblyopia early?

00:08:28.160 --> 00:08:29.960
It's because like I mentioned before,

00:08:29.960 --> 00:08:32.190
it's caused by risk factors that

00:08:32.190 --> 00:08:33.740
happen during early development.

00:08:33.740 --> 00:08:35.733
So that's before the age of seven.

00:08:37.776 --> 00:08:39.740
So if someone develops a need for glasses

00:08:39.740 --> 00:08:41.460
or strabismus after that age,

00:08:41.460 --> 00:08:44.980
amblyopia may not develop, which is good,

00:08:44.980 --> 00:08:46.450
because then it means that there might

00:08:46.450 --> 00:08:48.750
not be a long-term impact on vision.

00:08:48.750 --> 00:08:52.110
However, it still might
result in a visual impairment.

00:08:52.110 --> 00:08:54.067
So amblyopia also is reversible when

00:08:54.067 --> 00:08:56.340
it's treated within this sensitive period,

00:08:56.340 --> 00:08:58.620
so between birth and seven years of age.

00:08:58.620 --> 00:09:00.824
So while 90% can be treated by age three,

00:09:00.824 --> 00:09:05.040
this goes down to
virtually 0% if a patient

00:09:05.040 --> 00:09:08.173
presents to us at age 10 with
a diagnosis of amblyopia.

00:09:10.520 --> 00:09:11.980
So when we think about patients

00:09:11.980 --> 00:09:13.160
with developmental disability,

00:09:13.160 --> 00:09:15.050
I'm sorry for that
small font on the slide,

00:09:15.050 --> 00:09:17.650
but I wanted to include
this particular chart,

00:09:17.650 --> 00:09:18.790
because I thought it was a very nice

00:09:18.790 --> 00:09:22.470
summary of the types of vision impairment

00:09:22.470 --> 00:09:24.650
that we see in patients with various forms

00:09:24.650 --> 00:09:28.070
of developmental disability compared to

00:09:28.070 --> 00:09:30.037
the general pediatric population.

00:09:30.037 --> 00:09:32.336
And so sort of going through several forms

00:09:32.336 --> 00:09:34.580
of developmental disability such as

00:09:34.580 --> 00:09:36.590
intellectual disability, cerebral palsy,

00:09:36.590 --> 00:09:40.420
preterm birth, Down's Syndrome,

00:09:40.420 --> 00:09:42.391
all of these different forms actually

00:09:42.391 --> 00:09:47.260
have a higher rate of just
vision impairment in general.

00:09:47.260 --> 00:09:50.080
So vision under 220, significantly higher

00:09:50.080 --> 00:09:55.080
than the general population,
which is about 0.06%.

00:09:55.350 --> 00:09:56.680
Refractive errors are largest,

00:09:56.680 --> 00:10:00.451
so about over 50% of this
population actually need glasses.

00:10:00.451 --> 00:10:03.950
Similarly, over 50% of this population

00:10:03.950 --> 00:10:06.260
also have misalignment of their eyes.

00:10:06.260 --> 00:10:08.090
So that's a significant difference

00:10:08.090 --> 00:10:10.433
compared to about the six to 7%

00:10:10.433 --> 00:10:13.290
that we see in a general
pediatric population.

00:10:13.290 --> 00:10:14.700
So this is why vision screening

00:10:14.700 --> 00:10:16.179
might be even more important when

00:10:16.179 --> 00:10:18.020
we're talking about children who

00:10:18.020 --> 00:10:20.293
have developmental disabilities.

00:10:21.310 --> 00:10:23.150
So our current recommendations
for vision screening

00:10:23.150 --> 00:10:25.656
are to perform vision screening on all

00:10:25.656 --> 00:10:28.210
patients between the age of three to five

00:10:28.210 --> 00:10:31.400
to detect the presence of
amblyopia or it's risk factors,

00:10:31.400 --> 00:10:34.230
and this is something that
was agreed upon by many, many

00:10:34.230 --> 00:10:37.153
large organizations such at the
U.S Presentative Task Force,

00:10:37.153 --> 00:10:40.640
the American Academy of Ophthalmology,

00:10:40.640 --> 00:10:41.670
and then my organization,

00:10:41.670 --> 00:10:43.010
The American Academy of Pediatric

00:10:43.010 --> 00:10:44.563
Ophthalmology and Strabismus.

00:10:45.720 --> 00:10:47.900
And then in addition to that,

00:10:47.900 --> 00:10:49.470
the American Academy of Pediatric

00:10:49.470 --> 00:10:50.920
Ophthalmology and Strabismus actually

00:10:50.920 --> 00:10:54.380
recommends that patients that
have a neurodevelopmental

00:10:54.380 --> 00:10:56.096
disability actually be referred to

00:10:56.096 --> 00:11:00.450
an eye care provider, an
optometrist or an ophthalmologist

00:11:00.450 --> 00:11:01.977
for a comprehensive eye exam regardless

00:11:01.977 --> 00:11:05.019
of what the vision
screening testing shows.

00:11:05.019 --> 00:11:07.820
This is because oftentimes,
these patients may not

00:11:07.820 --> 00:11:12.710
have a positive test on
the vision screening,

00:11:12.710 --> 00:11:14.622
or even if they do, they might qualify

00:11:14.622 --> 00:11:18.463
for a general ophthalmology exam to enable

00:11:18.463 --> 00:11:21.513
them to be enrolled in
early intervention services.

00:11:23.660 --> 00:11:25.840
But this isn't what actually happens,

00:11:25.840 --> 00:11:28.560
unfortunately the
requirements of preventative

00:11:28.560 --> 00:11:31.850
eye care vary very broadly
throughout the country.

00:11:31.850 --> 00:11:34.025
Only 40 out of our 50 states require any

00:11:34.025 --> 00:11:36.920
vision screening for any children,

00:11:36.920 --> 00:11:39.740
and only 16 require vision screening

00:11:39.740 --> 00:11:41.540
for preschool age of children.

00:11:41.540 --> 00:11:43.350
This is the age that it's important to do

00:11:43.350 --> 00:11:47.146
before amblyopia becomes
irreversible, that's a minority.

00:11:47.146 --> 00:11:51.780
And then in 2011, only 40% of
children below the age of five

00:11:51.780 --> 00:11:53.989
actually underwent some
form of vision screening.

00:11:53.989 --> 00:11:57.110
While this is up from the 21% in the 80's,

00:11:57.110 --> 00:11:59.243
we still have quite a way to go.

00:12:00.370 --> 00:12:02.380
And then only one in five children

00:12:02.380 --> 00:12:04.810
with some form of developmental disability

00:12:04.810 --> 00:12:07.560
that should qualify for
early intervention programs

00:12:07.560 --> 00:12:11.133
are actually enrolled in
these before the age of three.

00:12:12.280 --> 00:12:14.420
So obviously, there is a good need

00:12:14.420 --> 00:12:16.990
for a standardized protocol,

00:12:16.990 --> 00:12:19.290
and more widespread and efficient

00:12:19.290 --> 00:12:21.150
approach for vision screening.

00:12:21.150 --> 00:12:24.087
So in order to sort of
answer what that might be,

00:12:24.087 --> 00:12:25.220
you sort of have to ask what is

00:12:25.220 --> 00:12:26.900
vision screening actually looking for?

00:12:26.900 --> 00:12:29.240
So number one, wanna look for amblyopia,

00:12:29.240 --> 00:12:31.884
which is sort of in the
center of this Venn diagram,

00:12:31.884 --> 00:12:33.650
and then also the risk factors

00:12:33.650 --> 00:12:35.900
that can contribute to amblyopia,

00:12:35.900 --> 00:12:38.500
but also can result in vision
loss in it's own right.

00:12:38.500 --> 00:12:41.480
So this is the need for
glasses or refractive error,

00:12:41.480 --> 00:12:43.580
having any structural
abnormality of the eye,

00:12:43.580 --> 00:12:45.380
or having a misalignment of the eye.

00:12:46.800 --> 00:12:48.840
Our conventional screening
tests that we have

00:12:48.840 --> 00:12:51.610
and are very easy to do and are readily

00:12:51.610 --> 00:12:53.180
available and cheap because we have

00:12:53.180 --> 00:12:55.060
this equipment already in our clinics,

00:12:55.060 --> 00:12:57.800
are vision testing with optotype acuity,

00:12:57.800 --> 00:13:00.230
and then something that's
called a red reflux test

00:13:00.230 --> 00:13:01.900
with the direct ophthalmoscope,

00:13:01.900 --> 00:13:04.000
that's the Bruckner Red Reflex Test.

00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:06.360
And these can look for all three

00:13:06.360 --> 00:13:11.360
of these different components
that can result in amblyopia.

00:13:13.870 --> 00:13:16.320
So before we talk about
visual acuity measurements,

00:13:16.320 --> 00:13:18.050
we have to know that the normal

00:13:18.050 --> 00:13:20.150
visual acuity does vary by age.

00:13:20.150 --> 00:13:21.870
We don't actually expect our children

00:13:21.870 --> 00:13:23.337
to develop 20/20 vision until

00:13:23.337 --> 00:13:25.817
they're at least five years old.

00:13:25.817 --> 00:13:28.500
Part of this has to do with the actual

00:13:28.500 --> 00:13:30.840
development of their visual pathway,

00:13:30.840 --> 00:13:33.570
but also their ability
to perform the tests.

00:13:33.570 --> 00:13:36.010
So our cutoffs for screening is usually

00:13:36.010 --> 00:13:39.530
around the age of 20/40
by age three to four,

00:13:39.530 --> 00:13:41.670
and 20/30 by age five, and this is with

00:13:41.670 --> 00:13:44.763
their standard optotype
recognition testing.

00:13:45.840 --> 00:13:47.530
And children that have disability,

00:13:47.530 --> 00:13:50.550
they will oftentimes, that form
of testing is not possible.

00:13:50.550 --> 00:13:51.660
Especially if they're not able

00:13:51.660 --> 00:13:53.841
to name or if they're nonverbal.

00:13:53.841 --> 00:13:56.650
So if a patient is able to have some

00:13:56.650 --> 00:13:58.561
level of cognitive skill, such as the

00:13:58.561 --> 00:14:00.601
ability to match and recognize shapes,

00:14:00.601 --> 00:14:04.060
one test that we often do
is called Lea matching.

00:14:04.060 --> 00:14:06.000
You show a single optotype on the screen

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:07.930
that has a varying size, so that

00:14:07.930 --> 00:14:09.700
sort of tells you their acuity,

00:14:09.700 --> 00:14:11.480
and then they have a
sheet in front of them

00:14:11.480 --> 00:14:13.920
with the same shapes, there's four

00:14:13.920 --> 00:14:15.150
different shapes in the test,

00:14:15.150 --> 00:14:18.360
and they point to which
one they see on the screen.

00:14:18.360 --> 00:14:19.780
This actually works very, very well

00:14:19.780 --> 00:14:22.020
in some of our patients are uncooperative.

00:14:22.020 --> 00:14:24.297
Even if they don't have a
developmental disability,

00:14:24.297 --> 00:14:26.778
if they're just shy,
but we often found this

00:14:26.778 --> 00:14:28.820
to be very, very helpful in our patients

00:14:28.820 --> 00:14:31.200
that are nonverbal for severe autism,

00:14:31.200 --> 00:14:35.610
or cerebral palsy, or any
other developmental disability.

00:14:35.610 --> 00:14:37.499
And then if that isn't even possible,

00:14:37.499 --> 00:14:39.379
if a patient isn't even able to have

00:14:39.379 --> 00:14:42.610
that ability to match,
to look on the screen,

00:14:42.610 --> 00:14:47.170
to point, we also have
resolution-based visual acuity tests.

00:14:47.170 --> 00:14:49.702
This is called the
teller-card acuity test.

00:14:49.702 --> 00:14:52.583
Basically with this test, we show a board

00:14:52.583 --> 00:14:55.400
of stripes on one side and a plain

00:14:55.400 --> 00:14:58.960
sort of screen on the other side,

00:14:58.960 --> 00:15:02.200
and we look to see if there's
a saccade towards the shape,

00:15:02.200 --> 00:15:03.890
towards the striped pattern.

00:15:03.890 --> 00:15:04.960
That would sort of indicate that

00:15:04.960 --> 00:15:06.880
there is acuity of that level.

00:15:06.880 --> 00:15:09.310
And then, the gradient of those stripes

00:15:09.310 --> 00:15:12.050
can actually decrease,
become finer and finer,

00:15:12.050 --> 00:15:13.530
and then you're able to determine

00:15:13.530 --> 00:15:16.410
whether someone is able
to resolve the difference

00:15:16.410 --> 00:15:19.750
between a striped pattern
versus a blank side,

00:15:19.750 --> 00:15:21.750
and that sort of gives
you a sense of acuity.

00:15:21.750 --> 00:15:24.459
So for this test, there's
no talking that's needed,

00:15:24.459 --> 00:15:26.180
there's no pointing that's needed,

00:15:26.180 --> 00:15:27.899
so virtually all of our patients,

00:15:27.899 --> 00:15:31.120
so long as they're able to
fixate or look at something,

00:15:31.120 --> 00:15:32.520
they're able to perform this test,

00:15:32.520 --> 00:15:35.070
and we're actually able to
get an objective acuity.

00:15:37.250 --> 00:15:39.570
So any type of optotype visual acuity

00:15:39.570 --> 00:15:41.940
is a good form of
testing, and sort of just

00:15:41.940 --> 00:15:44.760
looking at the value
of doing this testing,

00:15:44.760 --> 00:15:45.593
there's been a couple of different

00:15:45.593 --> 00:15:47.950
validation studies that have shown that

00:15:47.950 --> 00:15:49.401
the positive prediction value for

00:15:49.401 --> 00:15:52.564
doing any form of optotype
visual acuity testing

00:15:52.564 --> 00:15:55.820
is 60% when it comes to experienced users,

00:15:55.820 --> 00:15:58.450
those who know how to
do a visual acuity test.

00:15:58.450 --> 00:16:00.420
But when it comes to lay screeners,

00:16:00.420 --> 00:16:02.490
you know, if it was to
be done in a drug store,

00:16:02.490 --> 00:16:05.400
or sometimes in day cares, the positive

00:16:05.400 --> 00:16:08.889
predictive value falls
substantially to about 27%,

00:16:08.889 --> 00:16:09.970
so that's sort of something to keep in our

00:16:09.970 --> 00:16:11.894
back pocket when we think about

00:16:11.894 --> 00:16:14.423
the utility of this form of testing.

00:16:16.210 --> 00:16:17.940
So the second form of conventional testing

00:16:17.940 --> 00:16:20.181
is called the Bruckner Red Reflex Test.

00:16:20.181 --> 00:16:23.221
This is a test where a
direct ophthalmoscope is used

00:16:23.221 --> 00:16:27.100
to shine a light into
both of the patient's eyes

00:16:27.100 --> 00:16:29.800
from a distance of about
two to three feet away.

00:16:29.800 --> 00:16:30.720
So you don't have to actually

00:16:30.720 --> 00:16:32.540
approach the patient very close,

00:16:32.540 --> 00:16:34.270
which is very, very helpful in a lot

00:16:34.270 --> 00:16:36.637
of our patients that have sensory issues,

00:16:37.743 --> 00:16:41.300
or just feel uncomfortable
with bright lights by them,

00:16:41.300 --> 00:16:43.600
or won't let you occlude
one eye or another,

00:16:43.600 --> 00:16:45.520
'cause this is a binocular test.

00:16:45.520 --> 00:16:49.903
And basically, by shining
this light in both eyes,

00:16:49.903 --> 00:16:51.563
you are able to tell two things.

00:16:51.563 --> 00:16:55.080
Number one, is there a visual
access of pacification,

00:16:55.080 --> 00:16:57.530
so is there a structural
abnormality of the eye?

00:16:57.530 --> 00:16:58.810
You can tell that by seeing if

00:16:58.810 --> 00:17:00.200
there's an abnormal red reflex.

00:17:00.200 --> 00:17:02.050
And then secondly, you
can actually compare

00:17:02.050 --> 00:17:05.290
the quality of the red
reflex between the two eyes,

00:17:05.290 --> 00:17:08.610
and determine if one
eye is the fixating eye

00:17:08.610 --> 00:17:10.380
versus the amblyopic eye.

00:17:10.380 --> 00:17:12.170
So here in this picture, this patient

00:17:12.170 --> 00:17:13.350
is looking straight at you with

00:17:13.350 --> 00:17:15.352
the direct ophthalmoscope, and you can see

00:17:15.352 --> 00:17:18.950
here that one of the eyes
has a brighter crescent

00:17:18.950 --> 00:17:20.970
than the other eye, which is dimmer.

00:17:20.970 --> 00:17:22.580
It's actually that dimmer eye that's

00:17:22.580 --> 00:17:24.690
the one that's fixating on you,

00:17:24.690 --> 00:17:28.030
and it's the brighter eye that
has some sort of abnormality.

00:17:28.030 --> 00:17:29.720
You don't necessarily
need to know what that is,

00:17:29.720 --> 00:17:30.970
but you know at this point that you

00:17:30.970 --> 00:17:33.750
can refer to an ophthalmologist
or an optometrist

00:17:33.750 --> 00:17:35.160
to have a comprehensive eye exam,

00:17:35.160 --> 00:17:37.320
because almost assuredly, this patient

00:17:37.320 --> 00:17:39.570
has either a refractive error or

00:17:39.570 --> 00:17:41.993
a strabismus, or some form of amblyopia.

00:17:43.080 --> 00:17:44.802
With an experienced user,
which most practitioners

00:17:44.802 --> 00:17:47.160
would be very quite easily,

00:17:47.160 --> 00:17:50.160
this has a very high
predictive value of about 89%.

00:17:50.160 --> 00:17:52.453
So I think this is an underutilized test,

00:17:54.689 --> 00:17:56.769
but these conventional approaches

00:17:56.769 --> 00:17:58.880
do have substantial barriers.

00:17:58.880 --> 00:18:00.970
As we saw from the visual acuity testing,

00:18:00.970 --> 00:18:04.050
the positive predictive
value is quite dependent

00:18:04.050 --> 00:18:06.980
on the experience of the person

00:18:06.980 --> 00:18:09.249
who's taking the measurements.

00:18:09.249 --> 00:18:11.489
Part of this is because
these tests do work

00:18:11.489 --> 00:18:13.930
in better and more cooperative children,

00:18:13.930 --> 00:18:15.510
oftentimes when they're older.

00:18:15.510 --> 00:18:17.540
We do tend to have difficulty, even

00:18:17.540 --> 00:18:19.241
with the Bruckner Red
Reflux sometimes on children

00:18:19.241 --> 00:18:23.100
who are developmentally delayed,

00:18:23.100 --> 00:18:26.620
or who are younger or just
not cooperative in general.

00:18:26.620 --> 00:18:30.130
The visual acuity test does need

00:18:30.130 --> 00:18:32.900
to be done monocularly, to
test one eye, then the other,

00:18:32.900 --> 00:18:34.350
which is very time consuming.

00:18:34.350 --> 00:18:36.360
And so for that reason, people find this

00:18:36.360 --> 00:18:39.067
to be inefficient, and perhaps more

00:18:39.067 --> 00:18:41.668
cost-inefficient for the physicians.

00:18:41.668 --> 00:18:44.348
So because of that,
there's been a big push

00:18:44.348 --> 00:18:46.188
for automated vision screeners.

00:18:46.188 --> 00:18:49.210
And there's two different
types I wanna talk about.

00:18:49.210 --> 00:18:50.760
Number one is the photorefractors,

00:18:50.760 --> 00:18:52.730
which many of you might have already seen,

00:18:52.730 --> 00:18:54.650
and then a new technology that I sort

00:18:54.650 --> 00:18:56.308
of want to touch upon just a bit.

00:18:56.308 --> 00:18:58.588
So our photorefractors, there's three

00:18:58.588 --> 00:19:00.550
different types that I'll go through.

00:19:00.550 --> 00:19:03.320
But these are designed to
be operated by lay users.

00:19:03.320 --> 00:19:07.030
So, librarians, someone
who's in a daycare,

00:19:07.030 --> 00:19:09.325
anyone can use this
test because it's quick,

00:19:09.325 --> 00:19:11.480
it can be done at a distance,

00:19:11.480 --> 00:19:14.247
it doesn't have as much user variability,

00:19:14.247 --> 00:19:16.470
and it has sort of checks in place

00:19:16.470 --> 00:19:18.600
that you get an accurate result.

00:19:18.600 --> 00:19:19.990
It's a binocular test, you don't need

00:19:19.990 --> 00:19:21.290
to cover one eye or another, it takes

00:19:21.290 --> 00:19:23.290
about five seconds to do, and it can

00:19:23.290 --> 00:19:25.870
detect amblyopia risk factor, so normally

00:19:25.870 --> 00:19:27.220
a refractive error so it can sort

00:19:27.220 --> 00:19:28.480
of do a gross measurement of what

00:19:28.480 --> 00:19:29.870
a glasses prescription would be,

00:19:29.870 --> 00:19:31.700
and then also if there's a strabismus,

00:19:31.700 --> 00:19:33.870
or a misalignment of the eye.

00:19:33.870 --> 00:19:38.870
So before I did my talk last
year at Advances in Pediatrics,

00:19:39.930 --> 00:19:42.277
I actually had all of
these vision screeners

00:19:42.277 --> 00:19:44.118
sent to my office so I can try them out

00:19:44.118 --> 00:19:46.460
and sort of get my own feeling,

00:19:46.460 --> 00:19:48.150
'cause I'm gonna be validating them

00:19:48.150 --> 00:19:50.630
anyway in my clinic, the
comprehensive eye exam,

00:19:50.630 --> 00:19:52.540
just to see how accurate they were,

00:19:52.540 --> 00:19:53.877
what our experience was and what we

00:19:53.877 --> 00:19:56.490
felt our patients felt about it.

00:19:56.490 --> 00:19:57.870
So the first one we tested was a

00:19:57.870 --> 00:19:59.850
Spot Vision Screener by Welch Allyn,

00:19:59.850 --> 00:20:02.640
it's an infrared screener,
it's used at a distance

00:20:02.640 --> 00:20:06.140
away from the patient and can
measure a refractive error

00:20:06.140 --> 00:20:08.040
and strabismus, and then it gives you

00:20:08.040 --> 00:20:10.091
an instant interpretation
with pass or fail

00:20:10.091 --> 00:20:13.030
for whether to refer to an optometrist

00:20:13.030 --> 00:20:14.260
or an ophthalmologist or not,

00:20:14.260 --> 00:20:16.700
and then this is based
off of standard guidelines

00:20:16.700 --> 00:20:18.720
that were set forth by
the American Academy

00:20:18.720 --> 00:20:21.098
of Pediatric Ophthalmology and Strabismus,

00:20:21.098 --> 00:20:23.800
and this is our technician sort of

00:20:23.800 --> 00:20:25.720
holding this device testing it on me,

00:20:25.720 --> 00:20:28.370
and it sort of played
these flashing lights.

00:20:28.370 --> 00:20:30.640
It sort of moved in an undulating slow way

00:20:30.640 --> 00:20:33.490
with these bird chirping
sounds, it was quite soothing.

00:20:33.490 --> 00:20:34.970
Our patients actually said that they

00:20:34.970 --> 00:20:36.230
liked it very much and they

00:20:36.230 --> 00:20:38.470
were sort of enthralled by
it, so we thought it had

00:20:38.470 --> 00:20:41.453
a positive experience in that regard.

00:20:42.830 --> 00:20:44.320
And then the second one that we looked at

00:20:44.320 --> 00:20:46.930
was the plusoptiX
screener, it's very similar

00:20:46.930 --> 00:20:48.792
to the Spot Vision Screener as well,

00:20:48.792 --> 00:20:52.140
an infrared screener that
can be used at a distance,

00:20:52.140 --> 00:20:55.170
can measure refractive
error and strabismus.

00:20:55.170 --> 00:20:56.353
The one advantage to this one is that

00:20:56.353 --> 00:20:59.393
you can modify your referral criteria.

00:20:59.393 --> 00:21:01.074
Here in the U.S., we most always

00:21:01.074 --> 00:21:03.320
will be using the same criteria,

00:21:03.320 --> 00:21:05.860
but this would be allow it to be

00:21:05.860 --> 00:21:07.450
more applicable in different countries

00:21:07.450 --> 00:21:08.930
because there are different guidelines

00:21:08.930 --> 00:21:11.635
for one to refer to an
ophthalmologist or not.

00:21:11.635 --> 00:21:14.750
Likewise, it gives you
a pass or fail result.

00:21:14.750 --> 00:21:16.440
The one difference that we sort of

00:21:16.440 --> 00:21:19.370
felt and experienced was here there

00:21:19.370 --> 00:21:21.100
was sort of this clown shape with

00:21:21.100 --> 00:21:24.960
a strobe light and a louder, almost

00:21:24.960 --> 00:21:26.177
like a laughing, cackling noise,

00:21:26.177 --> 00:21:28.138
which while it drew attention,

00:21:28.138 --> 00:21:30.698
a lot of our patients
were quite scared of it,

00:21:30.698 --> 00:21:34.150
and I was a little scared of it as well.

00:21:34.150 --> 00:21:36.620
But specifically, for this population,

00:21:36.620 --> 00:21:39.980
for our autistic population
or those with sensory issues,

00:21:39.980 --> 00:21:43.100
it was quite a difficult
test for them to tolerate,

00:21:43.100 --> 00:21:44.723
at least in our experience.

00:21:46.170 --> 00:21:48.240
And then finally, the third test that we

00:21:48.240 --> 00:21:49.800
looked at was the GoCheck Kids.

00:21:49.800 --> 00:21:52.575
This is a cellphone-based vision screener.

00:21:52.575 --> 00:21:54.110
It works a little bit differently

00:21:54.110 --> 00:21:55.660
than the other two vision screeners

00:21:55.660 --> 00:21:58.016
in that it takes a photograph of

00:21:58.016 --> 00:22:00.840
the reflex that's admitted out of

00:22:00.840 --> 00:22:02.736
the two patients' eyes with a fixation,

00:22:02.736 --> 00:22:05.020
and then based off of that photograph,

00:22:05.020 --> 00:22:06.380
they're able to give an estimate

00:22:06.380 --> 00:22:09.337
of refractive error from the crescent

00:22:09.337 --> 00:22:12.177
of the light that's seen
from that photograph.

00:22:12.177 --> 00:22:15.010
It's not able to tell
strabismus like the other ones,

00:22:15.010 --> 00:22:16.450
but it's able to at least
give you a measurement

00:22:16.450 --> 00:22:18.700
of refractive error, and then similarly,

00:22:18.700 --> 00:22:20.480
give you a pass or fail and when to

00:22:20.480 --> 00:22:23.370
refer to a pediatric ophthalmologist.

00:22:23.370 --> 00:22:25.153
Because it's on your phone, it's a lot

00:22:25.153 --> 00:22:26.960
easier to use, you just sort of

00:22:26.960 --> 00:22:29.020
subscribe to a monthly subscription.

00:22:29.020 --> 00:22:32.410
I think our UCSF pediatricians

00:22:32.410 --> 00:22:34.394
are actually using this device.

00:22:34.394 --> 00:22:38.320
The one thing though, is that
it requires perfect fixation,

00:22:38.320 --> 00:22:39.440
it doesn't really give you that

00:22:39.440 --> 00:22:41.120
same sort of feedback that the other two

00:22:41.120 --> 00:22:44.570
do in terms of ensuring that
you have that perfect fixation,

00:22:44.570 --> 00:22:45.870
'cause otherwise you'll have a very, very

00:22:45.870 --> 00:22:48.340
high false positive rate.

00:22:48.340 --> 00:22:50.380
And then the one advantage that we felt

00:22:50.380 --> 00:22:52.020
was that because it's cell phones,

00:22:52.020 --> 00:22:53.380
and unfortunately in this day

00:22:53.380 --> 00:22:55.000
and age with millennial parents,

00:22:55.000 --> 00:22:56.820
everyone's taking photos and selfies,

00:22:56.820 --> 00:22:58.740
our kids are very used to having

00:22:58.740 --> 00:23:00.410
photos taken of them with a phone,

00:23:00.410 --> 00:23:01.960
so they're ready to cheese and

00:23:01.960 --> 00:23:04.010
be ready to look at this photo screen

00:23:04.010 --> 00:23:05.523
or to have the test be done.

00:23:07.840 --> 00:23:09.870
So I do wanna go through,
like I mentioned,

00:23:09.870 --> 00:23:11.900
some of the pros and cons of these tests.

00:23:11.900 --> 00:23:13.276
I sort of mentioned the advantages

00:23:13.276 --> 00:23:15.473
of automated vision screening in general

00:23:15.473 --> 00:23:19.123
that it allows anyone to be
able to use very, very quickly,

00:23:19.123 --> 00:23:23.480
and be done in a relatively accurate way.

00:23:23.480 --> 00:23:26.164
There are sort of downsides to these

00:23:26.164 --> 00:23:28.470
vision screening devices as well,

00:23:28.470 --> 00:23:31.000
and a lot of them has to
do with their positive

00:23:31.000 --> 00:23:32.940
and negative predictive values.

00:23:32.940 --> 00:23:34.125
So I wanna go through, first of all,

00:23:34.125 --> 00:23:36.910
just as a review,
positive predictive value

00:23:36.910 --> 00:23:40.270
is the percent of the time that a positive

00:23:40.270 --> 00:23:42.270
value is actually a true positive value

00:23:42.270 --> 00:23:44.150
that we see as ophthalmologists

00:23:44.150 --> 00:23:46.520
when we were doing our
confirmatory eye exam.

00:23:46.520 --> 00:23:47.774
So that's important to us, we want

00:23:47.774 --> 00:23:50.030
a high positive predictive value,

00:23:50.030 --> 00:23:52.640
because we don't want to
have too many referrals

00:23:52.640 --> 00:23:55.200
that then end up being negative.

00:23:55.200 --> 00:23:56.932
However, as a screener, the
negative predictive value

00:23:56.932 --> 00:23:59.860
is more important to you, because you

00:23:59.860 --> 00:24:01.650
want to ensure that a negative test

00:24:01.650 --> 00:24:03.223
is truly negative, and it's not truly

00:24:03.223 --> 00:24:05.380
missing an actual positive test.

00:24:05.380 --> 00:24:07.440
So as a screener, the
negative predictive value,

00:24:07.440 --> 00:24:09.630
having a high value for
that is important to you.

00:24:09.630 --> 00:24:11.880
So ideally, you would have
a high value for both,

00:24:11.880 --> 00:24:13.463
oftentimes we can't get that.

00:24:15.020 --> 00:24:16.773
So, one of the things that I looked for

00:24:16.773 --> 00:24:18.500
specifically when I was looking for

00:24:18.500 --> 00:24:21.050
validation testing was the use of these

00:24:21.050 --> 00:24:23.630
devices in the general population.

00:24:23.630 --> 00:24:25.460
Not in an ophthalmologist's office,

00:24:25.460 --> 00:24:27.100
which is where a lot of these validation

00:24:27.100 --> 00:24:28.470
tests were actually done.

00:24:28.470 --> 00:24:31.129
Because, as ophthalmologists
and as ophthalmic technicians,

00:24:31.129 --> 00:24:32.971
our staff are very, very trained

00:24:32.971 --> 00:24:34.930
with all of these different devices.

00:24:34.930 --> 00:24:36.940
So we're gonna always get a higher value

00:24:36.940 --> 00:24:37.957
for the positive predictive value

00:24:37.957 --> 00:24:39.730
and the negative predictive value.

00:24:39.730 --> 00:24:40.852
But that's not reflective of what

00:24:40.852 --> 00:24:43.700
the general use of what
this device would be.

00:24:43.700 --> 00:24:46.650
So I specifically sought
out community-based

00:24:46.650 --> 00:24:48.510
usages of these devices.

00:24:48.510 --> 00:24:51.190
So the first one I looked at
was the Spot Vision Screener.

00:24:51.190 --> 00:24:52.702
This was a study that
was done in the community

00:24:52.702 --> 00:24:56.710
in over 7,000 children of various ages,

00:24:56.710 --> 00:25:00.190
and the screener was
used by lay personnel.

00:25:00.190 --> 00:25:01.820
The positive predictive value for

00:25:01.820 --> 00:25:05.400
any amblyogenic risk factor was 65%.

00:25:05.400 --> 00:25:07.580
It's okay, they didn't check the negative

00:25:07.580 --> 00:25:09.760
predictive value, 'cause only the patients

00:25:09.760 --> 00:25:10.910
that had the positive predictive value

00:25:10.910 --> 00:25:13.130
were then referred to a
pediatric ophthalmologist

00:25:13.130 --> 00:25:15.290
to have a confirmatory eye exam, so we

00:25:15.290 --> 00:25:16.620
don't know if the negative values

00:25:16.620 --> 00:25:18.730
were truly negative or not.

00:25:18.730 --> 00:25:20.420
And then, specifically for

00:25:20.420 --> 00:25:22.130
patients with developmental delay,

00:25:22.130 --> 00:25:24.780
I found this study that again, was used

00:25:25.920 --> 00:25:27.609
by lay screeners in patients that had

00:25:27.609 --> 00:25:30.830
all forms of intellectual or neurologic

00:25:30.830 --> 00:25:32.532
or developmental disabilities.

00:25:32.532 --> 00:25:34.810
They had 100 children that were

00:25:34.810 --> 00:25:38.590
included in the study,
again, various age ranges.

00:25:38.590 --> 00:25:40.490
And here they mentioned both the positive

00:25:40.490 --> 00:25:41.820
and the negative predictive values

00:25:41.820 --> 00:25:43.653
because all of these
patients were screened

00:25:43.653 --> 00:25:45.653
by a pediatric
ophthalmologist or optometrist

00:25:45.653 --> 00:25:47.570
as they should have been since

00:25:47.570 --> 00:25:49.600
they do have these disabilities.

00:25:49.600 --> 00:25:51.950
They found though, that
the spot vision screener

00:25:51.950 --> 00:25:53.850
had a slightly lower
positive predictive value

00:25:53.850 --> 00:25:56.251
in this population of about 58%,

00:25:56.251 --> 00:25:58.450
with a negative predictive value

00:25:58.450 --> 00:26:01.120
is very, very high, of about 86%.

00:26:01.120 --> 00:26:02.900
So I think you can feel assured that

00:26:02.900 --> 00:26:05.310
a negative test, even in a developmentally

00:26:05.310 --> 00:26:08.093
delayed population is
actually truly negative.

00:26:09.186 --> 00:26:11.440
And then, sort of
similarly, when I'm looking

00:26:11.440 --> 00:26:13.509
at the plusoptiX screener, this is a study

00:26:13.509 --> 00:26:17.500
in all children, but this study included

00:26:17.500 --> 00:26:20.030
over 1,000 children of various ages

00:26:20.030 --> 00:26:22.750
using the Spot Vision
Screener by lay operators.

00:26:22.750 --> 00:26:24.930
The positive predictive value of

00:26:24.930 --> 00:26:27.210
this screening test was much higher

00:26:27.210 --> 00:26:29.135
than the Welch Allyn test at 81%,

00:26:29.135 --> 00:26:31.330
but again, this study didn't calculate

00:26:31.330 --> 00:26:32.580
the negative predictive value for

00:26:32.580 --> 00:26:34.970
the same reason as the previous study.

00:26:34.970 --> 00:26:37.540
And then I found this one for the

00:26:37.540 --> 00:26:39.960
use of the plusoptiX screener in

00:26:39.960 --> 00:26:42.274
patients with intellectual disability,

00:26:42.274 --> 00:26:45.460
which includes at least
a subset of patients

00:26:45.460 --> 00:26:47.520
that have some sort of developmental

00:26:47.520 --> 00:26:50.190
disability, and they
found here that again,

00:26:50.190 --> 00:26:52.383
when used by non medical personnel,

00:26:54.010 --> 00:26:55.845
this screening test had a lower

00:26:55.845 --> 00:26:58.950
positive predictive
value in this population,

00:26:58.950 --> 00:27:01.260
though the negative predictive
value is quite high.

00:27:01.260 --> 00:27:02.731
So I think we can feel assured that

00:27:02.731 --> 00:27:05.172
with either one of these
automated vision screeners,

00:27:05.172 --> 00:27:07.780
a negative predictive
value is truly negative,

00:27:07.780 --> 00:27:10.800
but even still for other social

00:27:10.800 --> 00:27:13.640
reasons or coordination reasons,

00:27:13.640 --> 00:27:15.010
will most likely will actually still

00:27:15.010 --> 00:27:16.713
need it at an actual eye exam.

00:27:18.430 --> 00:27:20.990
And then looking at the
GoCheck Kids device,

00:27:20.990 --> 00:27:23.300
this is unfortunately a newer technology,

00:27:23.300 --> 00:27:26.160
so they don't have a lot
of validation studies.

00:27:26.160 --> 00:27:27.700
So they have one in the community,

00:27:27.700 --> 00:27:29.040
and they don't have one in the

00:27:29.040 --> 00:27:32.030
developmentally disabled population,

00:27:32.030 --> 00:27:33.810
however, in this particular study,

00:27:33.810 --> 00:27:36.363
looking at the GoCheck
Kids Screening device,

00:27:36.363 --> 00:27:38.180
this was used in eye centers,

00:27:38.180 --> 00:27:39.883
this was used by eye personnel.

00:27:39.883 --> 00:27:41.420
The positive predictive value was

00:27:41.420 --> 00:27:43.650
actually quite low, at 57%,

00:27:43.650 --> 00:27:45.446
and then preliminary data from RUCSF

00:27:45.446 --> 00:27:49.950
sort of we're looking back
at our population here,

00:27:49.950 --> 00:27:52.459
is even lower and can
get even lower than that

00:27:52.459 --> 00:27:56.090
if it's used in patients that
are under 12 months of age.

00:27:56.090 --> 00:28:00.243
The negative predictive value,
however, is high, it's 83%.

00:28:01.440 --> 00:28:04.100
So all of these different
forms of vision screeners

00:28:04.100 --> 00:28:06.570
are looking for different
risk factors for amblyopia.

00:28:06.570 --> 00:28:10.100
They're looking for need for
glasses, or subtle strabismus.

00:28:10.100 --> 00:28:12.592
But they're not actually
looking for amblyopia itself.

00:28:12.592 --> 00:28:14.580
So the question is, is there some form

00:28:14.580 --> 00:28:16.290
of technology that can actually just

00:28:16.290 --> 00:28:18.194
look for that directly without sort

00:28:18.194 --> 00:28:19.770
of beating around the bush and give

00:28:19.770 --> 00:28:22.840
us a more accurate test result.

00:28:22.840 --> 00:28:24.610
So yes, there is this new technology

00:28:24.610 --> 00:28:25.770
that's just been created.

00:28:25.770 --> 00:28:28.439
It's not out in the market
yet, but it will be soon.

00:28:28.439 --> 00:28:32.030
This is called the Blinq by Rebion.

00:28:32.030 --> 00:28:34.210
It's a device that uses something

00:28:34.210 --> 00:28:36.410
that's called neural performance scanning,

00:28:36.410 --> 00:28:38.180
which basically means it uses a specific

00:28:38.180 --> 00:28:40.280
type of laser that rather than taking

00:28:40.280 --> 00:28:43.550
a photo of the reflex
that's generated by the eye,

00:28:43.550 --> 00:28:45.130
it actually sends a laser to the fovea,

00:28:45.130 --> 00:28:46.780
which is the back part of the eye,

00:28:46.780 --> 00:28:48.420
the central part of vision.

00:28:48.420 --> 00:28:51.542
And then based off of the birefringence

00:28:51.542 --> 00:28:56.143
that's received back from
the laser reflection,

00:28:56.143 --> 00:28:58.065
between the two eyes they can tell

00:28:58.065 --> 00:28:59.787
if there's a subtle misalignment

00:28:59.787 --> 00:29:02.507
or a subtle discrepancy, and thereby tell

00:29:02.507 --> 00:29:05.300
if there's actually truly amblyopia,

00:29:05.300 --> 00:29:08.270
or even a strabismus of about one degree,

00:29:08.270 --> 00:29:09.550
which is something that even us

00:29:09.550 --> 00:29:12.293
as eye professionals can't
do on our general eye exam.

00:29:15.390 --> 00:29:16.790
This is, again, a very new technology,

00:29:16.790 --> 00:29:18.440
so there's only one validation study

00:29:18.440 --> 00:29:20.784
and again, this one is
used in an eye care center.

00:29:20.784 --> 00:29:24.100
Here they found that when this particular

00:29:24.100 --> 00:29:26.950
technology was used in this population

00:29:26.950 --> 00:29:28.673
of 300 patients, it had a very, very high

00:29:28.673 --> 00:29:30.713
sensitivity, specificity, and a very

00:29:30.713 --> 00:29:33.830
high positive and
negative predictive value.

00:29:33.830 --> 00:29:37.280
So this could very well
be the future of vision

00:29:37.280 --> 00:29:39.373
screening in our patient populations.

00:29:40.790 --> 00:29:42.450
So I sort of put this chart together

00:29:42.450 --> 00:29:43.797
just in our last minute or so of

00:29:43.797 --> 00:29:47.400
going through the vision screening

00:29:47.400 --> 00:29:49.040
modalities that we've talked about,

00:29:49.040 --> 00:29:52.564
sort of thinking about the
pros and cons of each of them.

00:29:52.564 --> 00:29:54.500
The biggest thing that we wanna look at

00:29:54.500 --> 00:29:56.970
is the negative predictive value high,

00:29:56.970 --> 00:29:58.880
and is the positive predictive value high.

00:29:58.880 --> 00:30:00.367
Unfortunately when we look at our patients

00:30:00.367 --> 00:30:01.900
with developmental disabilities,

00:30:01.900 --> 00:30:03.540
that positive predictive value is

00:30:03.540 --> 00:30:06.248
a little bit lower than the
general pediatric population,

00:30:06.248 --> 00:30:08.568
but so long as the negative
predictive value is high,

00:30:08.568 --> 00:30:10.890
I would argue that it's a good

00:30:10.890 --> 00:30:13.683
screening test to be
used and can be trusted.

00:30:14.600 --> 00:30:17.000
When it comes to the cost though,
which is the big question,

00:30:17.000 --> 00:30:18.910
that's where the difference really lies.

00:30:18.910 --> 00:30:20.520
When you're thinking about vision testing,

00:30:20.520 --> 00:30:22.212
or the Bruckner Red Reflex,
these are things that

00:30:22.212 --> 00:30:24.190
you can do in your clinic with equipment

00:30:24.190 --> 00:30:25.570
that you already most likely have,

00:30:25.570 --> 00:30:27.290
so it's about a cost of zero.

00:30:27.290 --> 00:30:30.060
So for the automated vision screeners,

00:30:30.060 --> 00:30:33.600
these roughly cost about
$7,000 one time each.

00:30:33.600 --> 00:30:35.990
The GoCheck Kids, which
is the phone screener,

00:30:35.990 --> 00:30:38.240
costs about $60 a month, and then

00:30:38.240 --> 00:30:39.950
this new technology, we don't know.

00:30:39.950 --> 00:30:41.620
We'll see how much it
actually ends up costing,

00:30:41.620 --> 00:30:42.770
hopefully not too much.

00:30:43.670 --> 00:30:45.600
So just in conclusion, early vision

00:30:45.600 --> 00:30:47.790
screening is needed for
all pediatric patients,

00:30:47.790 --> 00:30:50.750
especially those with
developmental disabilities.

00:30:50.750 --> 00:30:52.650
Conventional methods such as visual

00:30:52.650 --> 00:30:54.250
acuity testing and Bruckner Reflex

00:30:54.250 --> 00:30:56.559
are very, very viable
options in this population,

00:30:56.559 --> 00:31:00.800
and should still be trusted.

00:31:00.800 --> 00:31:02.880
However, in order to make our screening

00:31:02.880 --> 00:31:05.720
more efficient for the general population

00:31:05.720 --> 00:31:07.450
from a public health standpoint,

00:31:07.450 --> 00:31:10.630
automated vision testing
can improve our efficiency.

00:31:10.630 --> 00:31:12.370
And then finally, newer technology

00:31:12.370 --> 00:31:15.014
can provide better results potentially.

00:31:15.014 --> 00:31:16.420
Thank you.

00:31:16.420 --> 00:31:18.670
(applause)
