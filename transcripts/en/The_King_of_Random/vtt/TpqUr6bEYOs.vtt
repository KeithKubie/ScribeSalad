00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:00.660
Hey guys.

00:00:00.660 --> 00:00:03.399
Today we're going to be taking
a look at DIY air conditioning.

00:00:03.399 --> 00:00:04.979
We're going to be
putting to the test of design

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:06.840
made popular by the HouseholdHacker,

00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:09.320
and then we're going to see if we
can tweak that design just a little bit

00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:10.800
to make it a little more effective.

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:12.800

00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:15.880
[Music]

00:00:15.880 --> 00:00:18.440
One of the things I like best about
the HouseholdHacker's air conditioner

00:00:18.450 --> 00:00:19.849
is how quickly it goes together.

00:00:19.849 --> 00:00:21.720
You can make the whole
thing in just a few minutes.

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:23.380
As the HouseholdHacker's design show,

00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:24.980
we've got a styrofoam cooler,

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:26.750
and a fan that we had lying around the house,

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:28.820
or one that we had the pick up at Walmart,

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:30.320
because we don't have many fans.

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:33.080
His original design showed
using two dryer vents,

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:36.360
angling the air out of the cooler
to wherever we wanted it to point.

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:39.360
However, I couldn't find those for
the low price he said he found his,

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:42.660
so instead, I've got
two 2-inch PVC elbows.

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:44.480
These should work
pretty much the same way,

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:46.720
allowing our air
to be angled up and out,

00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:48.440
and when these choose
where to point it.

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:50.020
Here's the basic idea.

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:52.940
We'll build the air conditioner
with the fan and two elbows

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:55.400
following the design given
to us by HouseholdHacker.

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:58.540
We'll then see if we can improve
on the design using cubed ice,

00:00:58.540 --> 00:01:01.720
and a few methods to try and improve
the circulation within the container.

00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:02.580
To get started,

00:01:02.580 --> 00:01:05.380
let's get our fan prepped,
and ready to go on our cooler.

00:01:05.380 --> 00:01:08.660
We want to remove this front
grill and this base clip as well,

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:10.620
so we just have the fan by itself,

00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:11.659
and we'll have the blades exposed,

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:14.580
which will let us put the
fan closer down onto the cooler

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:16.600
without losing
any air off to the sides.

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:17.520
With our fan prepped,

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:20.680
it's time to cut a hole in our lid that
will let the air flow into our cooler.

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:23.040
The lids on this particular
styrofoam container

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:25.220
are not quite as flat as
the one he was using,

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:26.900
but it should work pretty well anyway.

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:30.500
We want to cut a hole that's just
barely bigger than our fan blades.

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:31.939
You can see that on this cooler,

00:01:31.939 --> 00:01:35.439
that's going to involve cutting down
into the sloped portion of the lid.

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:37.220
I'm pretty sure
it's still going to work.

00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:40.300
Got that circle traced,
let's cut it out with a razor blade.

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:47.940
[Music]

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:49.220
We've measured this correctly.

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:51.810
We should be able to
place our fan onto our lid,

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:52.460
turn it on,

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:55.320
and not have the blades hit any
of the sides of the container.

00:01:56.940 --> 00:01:58.040
Hey, I think we did it.

00:01:58.940 --> 00:02:01.300
I think we've also invented
a super cheap hovercraft...

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:06.640
[Music]

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:11.200
Which only works if you're
actively blowing a fan into it,

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:12.820
by holding the fan above it.

00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:16.620
We now need to cut
two holes for our PVC elbows,

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:19.220
and those are going to go
on the sides of the center hole.

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:27.340
[Music]

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:28.800
Because of the slope,
I think it is going to be

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:32.180
just a little bit tricky to get
our hole cut to the perfect shape,

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:33.600
but I'm not too worried.

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:35.980
It's just gonna take a
little bit of trial and error.

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:41.240
[Music]

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:42.720
It's a pretty good fit right there.

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:46.080
Our tube is coming up out
of the inside of the box,

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:47.920
pointing at a 90 degree angle,

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:50.360
and if we want to change the
direction that it points in,

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:51.700
it spins quite easily.

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:54.320
Let's do the same
thing on the other side.

00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:56.100
[Music]

00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:59.880
We've got all the holes we need
for both the fan and the elbows.

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:02.740
We should now be able to put
this lid onto our container,

00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:05.700
place the fan on top with
some cooling elements inside,

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:08.760
and get some nice cold
air conditioned air flowing out.

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:10.280
In the HouseholdHacker's video,

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:13.260
he used frozen water bottles
as the source of the cold air.

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:15.540
So let's load up seven
of them into our cooler,

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:16.940
put the lid and the fan on,

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:20.200
and see what kind of cooled air
we can get blowing out of the elbows.

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:23.620
[Music]

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:25.040
We've got air flow.

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:27.290
I attached these little
strips of plastic on there,

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:29.240
not because they're
important to the function,

00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:32.220
but just because they show
when the fan is on or off.

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:35.000
Although there's enough
static electricity on this styrofoam

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:37.590
that they still like
to just hang out sometimes,

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:40.980
you can see how much it's
being drawn to my glove here.

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:43.920
Now, by putting my hand
or my face in front of this,

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:46.680
I can say that it does feel
like the air coming out

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:48.100
is colder than what's around,

00:03:48.100 --> 00:03:50.540
or even if I just had
a normal fan blowing on me.

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:54.020
But just to make sure I've got
some actual measurements,

00:03:54.020 --> 00:03:55.880
I have here a little thermometer,

00:03:55.880 --> 00:03:58.260
and this is actually a food thermometer,

00:03:58.260 --> 00:03:59.380
but it should work pretty well.

00:03:59.380 --> 00:04:03.060
Right now, it says that it's
about 72 degrees in this room.

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:05.500
Let's see what happens
if I place the temperature probe

00:04:05.510 --> 00:04:08.580
in front of the air
coming out of our cooled box.

00:04:08.580 --> 00:04:13.040
[Music]

00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:13.920
On this thermometer,

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:17.760
it seems to have stabilized
at about 65 degrees.

00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:18.780
That's certainly cooler.

00:04:18.780 --> 00:04:23.220
That's about seven or eight degrees
cooler than the ambient temperature.

00:04:23.220 --> 00:04:24.740
So, if it were 75,

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:26.520
and you thought that
was a little too warm,

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:29.420
you could bring it down
to maybe almost 65 degrees.

00:04:29.420 --> 00:04:30.879
That wouldn't be too bad.

00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:33.000
10 degrees colder is
nothing to be upset about,

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:34.720
but I think by adjusting the design,

00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:36.600
we can get some better results.

00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:38.960
With the current design
on this air conditioner,

00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:42.420
all of the air moves from
the fan over to the vents,

00:04:42.420 --> 00:04:43.380
and then leaves,

00:04:43.380 --> 00:04:46.760
and hopefully circulates down
among the ice before it does that.

00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:49.620
But I think we might be able to get some
better results if we force the issue.

00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:54.260
If the air had to travel down past all
of our ice before it got to the vents,

00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:56.000
we might get some colder air out of it.

00:04:56.440 --> 00:04:59.300
Here, I've got a piece
of 2-inch ABS tubing,

00:04:59.300 --> 00:05:01.580
which is designed to fit
right into these elbows.

00:05:01.580 --> 00:05:04.340
I want to cut this ABS pipe
to just the right length,

00:05:04.340 --> 00:05:07.140
so that it almost reaches
the bottom of our container,

00:05:07.140 --> 00:05:10.140
forcing the air to go
down past all the icy bottles

00:05:10.150 --> 00:05:12.009
before it goes into the tube,

00:05:12.009 --> 00:05:13.260
and then out the top.

00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:19.300
[Music]

00:05:19.300 --> 00:05:22.180
You can see that now the air
will have to flow down past

00:05:22.180 --> 00:05:24.380
the ice bottles into
the entry at the bottom,

00:05:24.380 --> 00:05:25.920
up out the top vent,

00:05:25.920 --> 00:05:28.400
where it should be a
little colder than before.

00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:33.800
Ambient temperature measuring just about
72 - 72 and 1/2 degrees Fahrenheit.

00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:37.620
For any interested,
that is 22 and 1/2 degrees Celsius.

00:05:37.620 --> 00:05:39.820
Let's try and measure
the air in front of the vent

00:05:39.820 --> 00:05:41.180
that doesn't have the extension,

00:05:41.180 --> 00:05:43.180
and then the vent that
does have the extension.

00:05:43.180 --> 00:05:44.960
We'll see if there's a
difference in the temperature.

00:05:44.960 --> 00:05:52.060
[Music]

00:05:52.060 --> 00:05:52.940
All right.

00:05:53.360 --> 00:05:54.660
Seems to be leveling off.

00:05:54.660 --> 00:05:55.740
It's not a huge difference,

00:05:55.740 --> 00:05:57.199
but we are looking at 3,

00:05:57.200 --> 00:06:02.660
3 and 1/2 degrees Fahrenheit cooler
on the one that vents down below the ice.

00:06:02.660 --> 00:06:04.920
So, we definitely
have a proof of concept.

00:06:04.920 --> 00:06:08.069
It is colder when it has
to travel down past the ice

00:06:08.069 --> 00:06:09.800
before it can vent out to us.

00:06:09.800 --> 00:06:11.139
Well, that worked on one side.

00:06:11.139 --> 00:06:13.280
I'm going to put another pipe
on the other side to see

00:06:13.280 --> 00:06:16.220
if we can just get that same
effect out of both vents.

00:06:17.180 --> 00:06:20.159
We're getting pretty good results
with our vents being fed by pipes

00:06:20.160 --> 00:06:23.020
that reach all the way
down past the cooling ice.

00:06:23.020 --> 00:06:25.400
But I think we can probably
do a little bit better.

00:06:25.400 --> 00:06:28.140
Frozen water bottles certainly
have some advantages.

00:06:28.140 --> 00:06:30.400
They're cheap, they're easy,
and they're reusable.

00:06:30.400 --> 00:06:31.260
Once they melt,

00:06:31.260 --> 00:06:32.779
you can pop them
back in the freezer,

00:06:32.779 --> 00:06:33.779
and refreeze them again.

00:06:33.780 --> 00:06:35.660
Then they're ready
to go a second time.

00:06:35.660 --> 00:06:39.620
However, because of their
shape and the plastic around them,

00:06:39.620 --> 00:06:43.139
they don't conduct the heat quite
as well as some plain ice cubes.

00:06:43.139 --> 00:06:45.520
So, I want to try this test
using some ice cubes

00:06:45.520 --> 00:06:47.020
rather than the frozen bottles.

00:06:47.020 --> 00:06:59.860
[Music]

00:06:59.860 --> 00:07:02.999
Our thermometer is now reading
under 50 degrees Fahrenheit

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:06.520
when the air has to travel through
the ice to get to the vents.

00:07:06.520 --> 00:07:09.080
I would say that's quite an improvement.

00:07:09.080 --> 00:07:10.720
We're getting some pretty good results.

00:07:10.720 --> 00:07:11.839
Less than 50 degrees Fahrenheit,

00:07:11.840 --> 00:07:15.120
is going to keep you cool on
pretty much even hottest of days.

00:07:15.120 --> 00:07:17.199
There does need to be a fair
bit of the ice down in there

00:07:17.199 --> 00:07:19.030
for the air to
really circulate through it.

00:07:19.030 --> 00:07:21.930
So, I have one more modification
I want to try that hopefully

00:07:21.930 --> 00:07:25.120
will let us circulate the air
through the ice without having

00:07:25.120 --> 00:07:26.760
to have quite so much of it in there.

00:07:27.340 --> 00:07:32.300
I got this sink mat at a
dollar store for you guessed it, $1,

00:07:32.300 --> 00:07:36.720
and I want to try using it
to suspend the ice up off the ground

00:07:36.720 --> 00:07:39.140
with the pipes passing down past it,

00:07:39.140 --> 00:07:42.199
so all of the air has to
travel through the ice,

00:07:42.200 --> 00:07:43.600
down below the mat,

00:07:43.600 --> 00:07:45.820
and then enter the vents from below.

00:07:46.080 --> 00:07:48.439
I'm gonna go for about halfway down,

00:07:48.440 --> 00:07:50.260
and it looks like right there,

00:07:50.260 --> 00:07:52.920
we have a width of about 8 inches.

00:07:52.920 --> 00:07:54.780
So, that's what we'll trim our mat to.

00:07:54.780 --> 00:08:03.500
[Music]

00:08:03.500 --> 00:08:05.300
That's a pretty good fit right there.

00:08:05.300 --> 00:08:07.089
Although with the weight of all the ice,

00:08:07.089 --> 00:08:09.000
I'm pretty sure that
would still fall down.

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:10.669
So, one more thing that
I do want to do is

00:08:10.669 --> 00:08:14.419
use a couple of thin dowels stabbed
through the size of our carton

00:08:14.419 --> 00:08:16.600
to support that weight.

00:08:16.600 --> 00:08:29.520
[Music]

00:08:29.520 --> 00:08:30.180
Lovely.

00:08:30.180 --> 00:08:33.260
Look at that little tray,
all ready to suspend ice,

00:08:33.260 --> 00:08:35.980
and just let air flow
right down through it.

00:08:35.980 --> 00:08:37.560
Of course, we're going
to need our pipes to reach

00:08:37.570 --> 00:08:38.570
down through there as well.

00:08:38.570 --> 00:08:39.640
So, let's throw our lid on,

00:08:39.640 --> 00:08:40.640
drop these down,

00:08:40.640 --> 00:08:42.540
and then mark off where
we need to cut some holes.

00:08:42.540 --> 00:08:53.340
[Music]

00:08:53.340 --> 00:08:54.720
Let's fill it up with ice.

00:08:54.720 --> 00:09:07.420
[Music]

00:09:07.420 --> 00:09:11.880
All right, ambient temperature
of about 72 degrees.

00:09:11.880 --> 00:09:13.480
See what this drops down to.

00:09:14.420 --> 00:09:15.940
46...

00:09:16.600 --> 00:09:17.500
Bam!

00:09:17.500 --> 00:09:20.890
46 degrees Fahrenheit,
that is pretty chilly.

00:09:20.890 --> 00:09:23.960
You're almost down to the temperature
of a refrigerator right there.

00:09:23.960 --> 00:09:25.600
That's not bad at all.

00:09:25.600 --> 00:09:27.760
There's one more thing
I do want to try though,

00:09:27.769 --> 00:09:30.110
and that's just see what
happens if we also put ice

00:09:30.110 --> 00:09:31.620
on the very bottom of the cooler.

00:09:31.620 --> 00:09:34.080
So, we've got ice,
and then the vent opening,

00:09:34.080 --> 00:09:36.220
and then more ice suspended above it,

00:09:36.220 --> 00:09:38.520
so the air has to travel down through ice,

00:09:38.520 --> 00:09:40.760
and then there's still
even more ice below.

00:09:40.760 --> 00:09:42.620
I think this could give us
our best result yet.

00:09:42.620 --> 00:09:43.560
Let's give it a shot.

00:09:46.080 --> 00:09:47.380
And it's just going to fall on its own.

00:09:48.240 --> 00:09:51.160
Shake it to get it evenly dispersed.

00:09:51.160 --> 00:09:56.800
[Music]

00:09:56.800 --> 00:10:00.520
We are leveling off right
about in the 42 degree range,

00:10:00.520 --> 00:10:02.340
that's in Fahrenheit of course.

00:10:02.660 --> 00:10:03.920
Switch this over to Celsius,

00:10:03.920 --> 00:10:09.680
and we can see that we are measuring
at less than 6 degrees Celsius,

00:10:10.160 --> 00:10:11.860
5 and 1/2 approximately.

00:10:11.860 --> 00:10:14.120
That is nice and chilly.

00:10:14.580 --> 00:10:18.640
Now, as for whether or not one
of these will cool down a whole room,

00:10:18.640 --> 00:10:19.640
it's hard to say.

00:10:19.640 --> 00:10:23.720
I don't have a perfectly enclosed room
that I can do side-by-side test with.

00:10:23.720 --> 00:10:27.300
But this is the kind of thing you probably
want to set on the couch next to you,

00:10:27.300 --> 00:10:28.840
while you're just
sitting watching something.

00:10:29.200 --> 00:10:32.320
That is some very nice cold air
blowing on there right now.

00:10:32.660 --> 00:10:35.400
The original version of this
DIY air conditioner was

00:10:35.400 --> 00:10:36.750
designed by HouseholdHacker,

00:10:36.750 --> 00:10:39.759
and he called it an
$8 air conditioning system.

00:10:39.760 --> 00:10:40.260
Now, of course,

00:10:40.260 --> 00:10:43.380
that assumes that you have a little
fan that's just the right size,

00:10:43.380 --> 00:10:44.640
and some water bottles.

00:10:44.640 --> 00:10:47.340
Water bottles are very cheap,
but you do still have to get them.

00:10:47.340 --> 00:10:49.960
This version does cost a little bit more.

00:10:49.960 --> 00:10:51.300
I had to actually go out and buy a fan,

00:10:51.300 --> 00:10:52.980
because I didn't have one lying around.

00:10:52.980 --> 00:10:57.960
These elbows were a little over $2,
each I think about $2.20.

00:10:57.960 --> 00:10:58.780
The fan was $10.

00:10:58.780 --> 00:11:00.900
The elbows together were about 5.

00:11:00.900 --> 00:11:02.580
The cooler was less than $3,

00:11:02.580 --> 00:11:05.700
I think it was $2.80 at Target,

00:11:05.700 --> 00:11:08.080
and then added the plastic
grate which cost $1,

00:11:08.089 --> 00:11:09.329
and the two pieces of the dowel.

00:11:09.329 --> 00:11:11.520
I think that dowel was about 60 cents.

00:11:11.520 --> 00:11:12.940
So altogether,
after buying everything,

00:11:12.940 --> 00:11:14.780
including the fan and the ice,

00:11:14.780 --> 00:11:17.340
this air conditioner costs about $20.

00:11:17.340 --> 00:11:18.660
That's a pretty good price.

00:11:18.660 --> 00:11:19.940
If you live somewhere hot,

00:11:19.940 --> 00:11:21.389
and you don't happen to
have air conditioning,

00:11:21.389 --> 00:11:23.459
or maybe there's just
that one room in your house

00:11:23.460 --> 00:11:25.380
where the AC doesn't quite do it,

00:11:25.380 --> 00:11:26.820
this might be a good solution for you.

00:11:26.820 --> 00:11:28.740
It's pumping out very cold air,

00:11:28.740 --> 00:11:30.220
and it should last quite a while.

00:11:30.960 --> 00:11:33.020
Guys, that's not all,
we've got more for you to see.

00:11:33.021 --> 00:11:35.990
That little box up at the top
will transport you directly to our last video,

00:11:35.990 --> 00:11:37.310
and you should go check that out.

00:11:37.310 --> 00:11:39.000
The box of the button
will show you what YouTube thinks

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:40.460
you need to be watching now.

00:11:40.460 --> 00:11:42.580
This bomb here in the middle
will subscribe you to the channel

00:11:42.580 --> 00:11:44.240
so you never miss a video.

00:11:44.240 --> 00:11:45.240
Don't forget to ring that bell,

00:11:45.240 --> 00:11:46.300
and we'll see you in the next one.

00:11:46.300 --> 00:11:47.100
Talk to you then.
