NICK: Hi, everyone, and welcome
again to the San

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:05.250
Francisco office, to another
Talks at Google event.

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:07.970
We're very pleased to welcome
George Packer here today to

00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:12.750
talk about his new book, "The
Unwinding." And George is

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:15.100
currently a staff writer and has
been for "The New Yorker"

00:00:15.100 --> 00:00:16.149
since 2003.

00:00:16.149 --> 00:00:18.940
He's covered the Iraq War for
the magazine and has also

00:00:18.940 --> 00:00:22.180
written about the atrocities
committed in Sierra Leone,

00:00:22.180 --> 00:00:25.650
civil unrest in the Ivory Coast,
the mega city of Lagos,

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:27.770
and global counter insurgency.

00:00:27.770 --> 00:00:30.950
His book "The Assassins' Gate:
America in Iraq" was named one

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:34.360
of the 10 best books of 2005
by "The New York Times" and

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:36.710
won the New York Public
Library's Helen Bernstein Book

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:39.680
Award and an Overseas Press
Club Book Award.

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:41.860
He's authored several nonfiction
books and two

00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:45.580
novels, contributed numerous
articles, essays, and reviews

00:00:45.580 --> 00:00:48.930
on foreign affairs, American
politics, and literature to

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:52.090
"The New York Times Magazine,"
"Dissent," "Mother Jones,"

00:00:52.090 --> 00:00:54.040
"Harper's," and another
publications.

00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:55.620
He's taught writing at Harvard,

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:56.150
Bennington, and Columbia.

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:58.110
And he currently lives in
Brooklyn, in New York.

00:00:58.110 --> 00:01:00.020
But this is a homecoming
of sorts, because he

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:01.430
grew up in Palo Alto.

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:03.020
So welcome back to
the left coast.

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:04.769
Please welcome George
Packer to Google.

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:06.717
[APPLAUSE]

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:11.870
GEORGE PACKER: Thank
you, Nick.

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:14.090
It is wonderful to
be at Google.

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:16.170
There was no Google when
I was growing up here.

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:18.330
Google has changed everything.

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:20.780
And it's great always
to come back and see

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:21.670
what's happening here.

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:25.500
It always feels like if I get
depressed in other parts of

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:28.580
the country, to come back to
the Bay Area and sit out on

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:31.240
the Bay with my macchiato, ,
nothing could possibly be

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:33.440
wrong anywhere in the world.

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:35.930
And this is where you
live and work.

00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:39.260
So lucky, you.

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:42.050
I'm going to talk a bit about
"The Unwinding: An Inner

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:44.990
History of the New America,"
and read a bit from it.

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:48.300
And then I'd love to answer
questions about it.

00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:52.790
But the book began, in a way,
back in Iraq, which I covered

00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:59.860
for "The New Yorker." And as
Iraq imploded in the early

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:03.590
years of the war, I went from
seeing it as a failure of

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:04.580
leadership--

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:10.850
we know their names, people
in Washington, generals,

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:14.140
politicians, people
in the media--

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:15.480
to seeing it more as an

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:17.380
institutional failure, as well.

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:19.790
You couldn't just pin it
on this or that person.

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:24.100
It seemed like whole American
institutions were put to this

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:27.000
stress test in Iraq, like we
tried to do something really

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.770
hard, harder than we'd done in
a very long time, and it

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:35.360
turned out the body politic was
in really bad shape from

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:40.010
government to media, the
military intelligence.

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:42.350
And I began to wonder,
how did this happen?

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:44.000
Has it been happening
for a long time?

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:49.520
Why has it happened that we were
able to rebuild postwar

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:53.450
Europe and we weren't able to
bring electricity to Baghdad

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:56.880
to the level it had been
at before the war?

00:02:56.880 --> 00:03:00.880
And then I came home from Iraq
and covered the 2008

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:04.270
presidential election, and
suddenly institutions were

00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:05.940
collapsing all around us.

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:07.370
Wall Street was collapsing.

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:08.680
General Motors.

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:11.920
It seemed as if all the pillars
of American life, one

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:17.270
after another, were eroding or
absolutely falling to pieces.

00:03:17.270 --> 00:03:21.810
And that was the beginning
of my thinking about "The

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:30.100
Unwinding." I decided that I
wanted to tell the story of

00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:33.240
how and why this happened, but
not to do it in the usual way.

00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:37.820
There'd been lots and lots of
great books written about the

00:03:37.820 --> 00:03:41.320
decline of the middle class in
the last generation, income

00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:45.170
inequality, political
polarization, globalization

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:47.150
and its effect on the economy.

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:49.050
I didn't want to write
a policy book.

00:03:49.050 --> 00:03:52.840
I wanted to write a narrative,
a book that would feel like

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:56.550
reading a novel, except that all
of it would be true, or as

00:03:56.550 --> 00:03:58.400
true as I could make it.

00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:02.020
And it would tell the story
of the past generation.

00:04:02.020 --> 00:04:06.840
Because my view is that since
around the late '70s, which

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:09.890
happens to be when I graduated
from high school and Palo Alto

00:04:09.890 --> 00:04:11.550
for good-- so everything
has gone to hell

00:04:11.550 --> 00:04:14.160
since I left Palo Alto--

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:18.209
there's been a kind of undoing
of the deal that used to exist

00:04:18.209 --> 00:04:23.630
between Americans, which was
if you did your part and

00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:26.350
worked hard and held up your
end, there would be a place

00:04:26.350 --> 00:04:29.990
for you in American life
and an even better

00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:31.110
place for your children.

00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:34.340
It was the dream of upward
mobility and equal

00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:35.300
opportunity.

00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:40.060
And although that dream was
never true for all Americans,

00:04:40.060 --> 00:04:42.820
the circle of inclusion widened
to include more and

00:04:42.820 --> 00:04:44.080
more of us.

00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:49.040
And the reality of equal
opportunity was paid

00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:50.550
off, was made good.

00:04:50.550 --> 00:04:53.430
And I think in the last
generation, we've seen that

00:04:53.430 --> 00:04:55.280
begin to come apart.

00:04:55.280 --> 00:05:01.210
And instead there's a sense in
which rather than institutions

00:05:01.210 --> 00:05:05.240
like the ones I named earlier
supporting the aspirations of

00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:08.650
ordinary Americans, more and
more people feel like they're

00:05:08.650 --> 00:05:11.330
in it on their own and have
to find their own way.

00:05:11.330 --> 00:05:14.430
It's an age of entrepreneurs
rather than of structures and

00:05:14.430 --> 00:05:16.090
institutions.

00:05:16.090 --> 00:05:18.230
For some people, that's
been very good.

00:05:18.230 --> 00:05:22.580
And for other people, that's
been destabilizing and even

00:05:22.580 --> 00:05:25.060
devastating.

00:05:25.060 --> 00:05:32.180
So to tell this story in this
novelistic way, I wanted to

00:05:32.180 --> 00:05:34.920
write about the whole
country in a way.

00:05:34.920 --> 00:05:36.740
It was a preposterous
ambition.

00:05:36.740 --> 00:05:38.610
I think I've reached the point
in my career where I just got

00:05:38.610 --> 00:05:45.050
tired of doing things in sort
of the way that would be

00:05:45.050 --> 00:05:49.050
easiest for me or most
successful or following in a

00:05:49.050 --> 00:05:50.420
template that had
worked before.

00:05:50.420 --> 00:05:54.170
I wanted to try something
completely new in my own work.

00:05:54.170 --> 00:05:56.500
And this book is a departure
from everything

00:05:56.500 --> 00:05:57.750
I've written before.

00:05:59.920 --> 00:06:03.120
I wanted to tell the story of
the most successful and the

00:06:03.120 --> 00:06:07.000
least, the power centers like
Washington, Wall Street,

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:09.960
Silicon Valley, and
also the forgotten

00:06:09.960 --> 00:06:12.570
places of the country.

00:06:12.570 --> 00:06:16.680
The celebrities, and they're
portraits of everyone from

00:06:16.680 --> 00:06:21.330
Jay-Z and Newt Gingrich to Alice
waters and Elizabeth

00:06:21.330 --> 00:06:23.440
Warren in the book.

00:06:23.440 --> 00:06:27.260
And also obscure people whom
you've never heard of, and who

00:06:27.260 --> 00:06:28.580
are the main characters
in the book.

00:06:28.580 --> 00:06:30.960
There's about four
or five of them.

00:06:30.960 --> 00:06:34.050
And so this was this big
panoramic and yet very

00:06:34.050 --> 00:06:37.590
intimate picture of the country
as it's evolved in the

00:06:37.590 --> 00:06:39.110
last generation.

00:06:39.110 --> 00:06:41.960
So first I'm going to read the
prologue, which will give you

00:06:41.960 --> 00:06:48.260
a sense of the ambitions of the
book and the themes of the

00:06:48.260 --> 00:06:51.360
book, and then talk a little
bit more about some of the

00:06:51.360 --> 00:06:52.610
characters in it.

00:06:55.300 --> 00:06:59.250
No one can say when the
unwinding began, when the coil

00:06:59.250 --> 00:07:02.590
that held Americans together
in its secure and sometimes

00:07:02.590 --> 00:07:05.580
stifling grip first gave way.

00:07:05.580 --> 00:07:08.980
Like any great change, the
unwinding began at countless

00:07:08.980 --> 00:07:13.280
times, in countless ways, and at
some moment, the country--

00:07:13.280 --> 00:07:15.600
always the same country--

00:07:15.600 --> 00:07:17.550
crossed a line of history
and became

00:07:17.550 --> 00:07:20.000
irretrievably different.

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:23.630
If you were born around 1960 or
afterward, you spent your

00:07:23.630 --> 00:07:26.860
adult life in the vertigo
of that unwinding.

00:07:26.860 --> 00:07:29.620
You watched structures that have
been in place before your

00:07:29.620 --> 00:07:33.880
birth collapse like pillars of
salt across the vast visible

00:07:33.880 --> 00:07:35.100
landscape--

00:07:35.100 --> 00:07:38.270
the farms of the Carolina
Piedmont, the factories of the

00:07:38.270 --> 00:07:40.230
Mahoning Valley, Florida

00:07:40.230 --> 00:07:43.420
subdivisions, California schools.

00:07:43.420 --> 00:07:47.280
And other things harder to
see but no less vital in

00:07:47.280 --> 00:07:50.580
supporting the order of everyday
life changed beyond

00:07:50.580 --> 00:07:51.560
recognition--

00:07:51.560 --> 00:07:55.270
ways and means in Washington
caucus rooms, taboos on New

00:07:55.270 --> 00:07:59.870
York trading desks, manners
and morals everywhere.

00:07:59.870 --> 00:08:03.300
When the norms that made the old
institutions useful began

00:08:03.300 --> 00:08:06.810
to unwind and the leaders
abandoned their posts, the

00:08:06.810 --> 00:08:09.430
Roosevelt republic that had
reined for almost half a

00:08:09.430 --> 00:08:11.530
century came undone.

00:08:11.530 --> 00:08:14.620
The void was filled by the
default force in American

00:08:14.620 --> 00:08:17.480
life-- organized money.

00:08:17.480 --> 00:08:19.520
The unwinding is nothing new.

00:08:19.520 --> 00:08:22.550
There have been unwindings every
generation or two, the

00:08:22.550 --> 00:08:25.610
fall to earth of the Founders'
Heavenly Republic in a noisy

00:08:25.610 --> 00:08:29.050
marketplace of quarrelsome
factions, the war that tore

00:08:29.050 --> 00:08:31.900
the United States apart and
turned them from plural to

00:08:31.900 --> 00:08:35.289
singular, the crash that laid
waste to the business of

00:08:35.289 --> 00:08:37.919
America, making way
for a democracy of

00:08:37.919 --> 00:08:40.480
bureaucrats and everymen.

00:08:40.480 --> 00:08:42.470
Each decline brought renewal.

00:08:42.470 --> 00:08:45.070
Each implosion released
energy.

00:08:45.070 --> 00:08:49.150
Out of each unwinding
came a new cohesion.

00:08:49.150 --> 00:08:52.370
The unwinding brings freedom
more than the world has ever

00:08:52.370 --> 00:08:56.170
granted and to more kinds of
people than ever before.

00:08:56.170 --> 00:08:59.850
Freedom to go away, freedom to
return, freedom to change your

00:08:59.850 --> 00:09:05.470
story, get your facts, get
hired, get fired, get high,

00:09:05.470 --> 00:09:10.910
marry, divorce, go broke, begin
again, start a business,

00:09:10.910 --> 00:09:14.880
have it both ways, take it to
the limit, walk away from the

00:09:14.880 --> 00:09:18.860
ruins, succeed beyond your
dreams and boast about it,

00:09:18.860 --> 00:09:22.550
fail abjectly and try again.

00:09:22.550 --> 00:09:24.940
And with freedom, the
unwinding brings its

00:09:24.940 --> 00:09:28.860
illusions, for all these
pursuits are as fragile as

00:09:28.860 --> 00:09:32.630
thought balloons popping
against circumstances.

00:09:32.630 --> 00:09:35.090
Winning and losing are
All-American games.

00:09:35.090 --> 00:09:38.490
And in the unwinding, winners
win bigger than ever, floating

00:09:38.490 --> 00:09:40.950
away like bloated dirigibles.

00:09:40.950 --> 00:09:43.930
And losers have a long way to
fall before they hit bottom,

00:09:43.930 --> 00:09:46.810
and sometimes they never do.

00:09:46.810 --> 00:09:50.200
This much freedom leaves
you on your own.

00:09:50.200 --> 00:09:53.460
More Americans than ever before
live alone, but even a

00:09:53.460 --> 00:09:57.040
family can exist in isolation,
just managing to survive in

00:09:57.040 --> 00:09:59.700
the shadow of a huge military
base without a

00:09:59.700 --> 00:10:01.850
soul to lend a hand.

00:10:01.850 --> 00:10:05.080
A shiny new community can spring
up overnight miles from

00:10:05.080 --> 00:10:08.370
anywhere, then fade
away just as fast.

00:10:08.370 --> 00:10:12.160
And old city can lose its
industrial foundation and 2/3

00:10:12.160 --> 00:10:14.390
of its people while all
its mainstays--

00:10:14.390 --> 00:10:15.490
churches, government,

00:10:15.490 --> 00:10:17.920
businesses, charities, unions--

00:10:17.920 --> 00:10:20.860
fall like building flats
in a strong wind

00:10:20.860 --> 00:10:23.840
hardly making a sound.

00:10:23.840 --> 00:10:28.000
Alone on a landscape without
solid structures, Americans

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:31.290
have to improvise their own
destinies, plot their own

00:10:31.290 --> 00:10:34.420
stories of success
and salvation.

00:10:34.420 --> 00:10:37.560
A North Carolina boy clutching
a Bible in the sunlight grows

00:10:37.560 --> 00:10:40.310
up to receive a new vision of
how the countryside could be

00:10:40.310 --> 00:10:42.200
resurrected.

00:10:42.200 --> 00:10:44.880
A young man goes to Washington
and spends the rest of his

00:10:44.880 --> 00:10:48.000
career trying to recall the idea
that drew him there in

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:49.810
the first place.

00:10:49.810 --> 00:10:52.800
An Ohio girl has to hold her
life together as everything

00:10:52.800 --> 00:10:56.180
around her falls apart until
in middle age she finally

00:10:56.180 --> 00:11:00.220
seizes the chance to do more
than just survive.

00:11:00.220 --> 00:11:02.670
As these obscure Americans
find their way in the

00:11:02.670 --> 00:11:06.840
unwinding, they pass alongside
new monuments where the old

00:11:06.840 --> 00:11:11.190
institutions one stood, the
outsized lives of their most

00:11:11.190 --> 00:11:15.600
famous countryman, celebrities
who only grow more exalted as

00:11:15.600 --> 00:11:17.810
other things recede.

00:11:17.810 --> 00:11:20.930
These icons sometimes occupy
the personal place of

00:11:20.930 --> 00:11:22.770
household gods.

00:11:22.770 --> 00:11:25.670
And they offer themselves as
answers to the riddle of how

00:11:25.670 --> 00:11:28.690
to live a good or better life.

00:11:28.690 --> 00:11:32.350
In the unwinding, everything
changes and nothing lasts

00:11:32.350 --> 00:11:34.130
except for the voices--

00:11:34.130 --> 00:11:35.570
American voices--

00:11:35.570 --> 00:11:39.940
open sentimental, angry, matter
of fact, inflected with

00:11:39.940 --> 00:11:45.190
borrowed ideas, God, TV, and
the dimly remembered past,

00:11:45.190 --> 00:11:48.520
telling a joke above the noise
of the assembly line,

00:11:48.520 --> 00:11:50.890
complaining behind window
shades drawn against the

00:11:50.890 --> 00:11:55.130
world, thundering justice to
a crowded park or an empty

00:11:55.130 --> 00:11:59.590
chamber, closing a deal on the
phone, dreaming aloud late at

00:11:59.590 --> 00:12:01.930
night on a front
porch as trucks

00:12:01.930 --> 00:12:03.180
rush by in the darkness.

00:12:05.630 --> 00:12:09.610
That just gave you a map
of the entire book.

00:12:09.610 --> 00:12:14.610
That Ohio girl who grows up to
be an assembly line worker is

00:12:14.610 --> 00:12:17.520
a woman named Tammy Thomas, a
black woman in Youngstown,

00:12:17.520 --> 00:12:21.080
Ohio, who grew up while
Youngstown, this great old

00:12:21.080 --> 00:12:23.820
steel city, lost its
mills, lost its

00:12:23.820 --> 00:12:26.400
jobs, lost itself really.

00:12:26.400 --> 00:12:29.280
And, yet, she somehow raised
three kids on their own

00:12:29.280 --> 00:12:32.090
because you had one of the last
good blue collar jobs

00:12:32.090 --> 00:12:38.040
until it was off-shored in a
bankruptcy that managed to gut

00:12:38.040 --> 00:12:41.060
the company while making a
few people very wealthy.

00:12:41.060 --> 00:12:44.680
And she remade herself into a
community organizer just in

00:12:44.680 --> 00:12:47.530
time for Obama's election.

00:12:47.530 --> 00:12:49.980
Jeff Connaughton is this
Washington operative in the

00:12:49.980 --> 00:12:53.350
book who starts out as a Biden
guy, becomes disillusioned

00:12:53.350 --> 00:12:55.460
with Biden, becomes a
lobbyist, becomes

00:12:55.460 --> 00:12:57.740
disillusioned with lobbying,
and then goes back into

00:12:57.740 --> 00:13:01.700
government to try to make Wall
Street pay for the financial

00:13:01.700 --> 00:13:05.980
crisis, and doesn't
quite succeed.

00:13:05.980 --> 00:13:12.660
Dean Price is the North Carolina
boy who grows up in

00:13:12.660 --> 00:13:13.440
the Bible Belt.

00:13:13.440 --> 00:13:16.510
His father is a
fire-and-brimstone preacher.

00:13:16.510 --> 00:13:21.830
It is as red as a red America
gets anywhere.

00:13:21.830 --> 00:13:24.020
He wants to be an
entrepreneur.

00:13:24.020 --> 00:13:29.130
And so he opens a chain of truck
stops along Route 220

00:13:29.130 --> 00:13:31.260
between North Carolina
and Virginia--

00:13:31.260 --> 00:13:34.120
fast food, convenience
stores--

00:13:34.120 --> 00:13:38.840
and finds that it's harder and
harder to make it as the big

00:13:38.840 --> 00:13:44.040
box stores move in and squeeze
out local businesses, and

00:13:44.040 --> 00:13:49.460
multinational oil companies
and national gas chains

00:13:49.460 --> 00:13:51.690
undercut his price.

00:13:51.690 --> 00:13:55.900
And so Dean is really
one of the main

00:13:55.900 --> 00:13:56.990
characters in the book.

00:13:56.990 --> 00:14:00.800
You follow these stories in the
book through the course of

00:14:00.800 --> 00:14:03.970
this generation from the late
'70s to the present.

00:14:03.970 --> 00:14:06.840
You move back and forth between
these main characters.

00:14:06.840 --> 00:14:09.880
And I should also mention
someone relevant here, Peter

00:14:09.880 --> 00:14:13.410
Thiel, who is sort of our guide
to Silicon Valley in the

00:14:13.410 --> 00:14:16.450
book and who was obviously the
founder of PayPal and the

00:14:16.450 --> 00:14:19.680
first outside investor
and Facebook and

00:14:19.680 --> 00:14:22.730
noted contrarian thinker.

00:14:22.730 --> 00:14:26.110
Tampa is a big part of the book,
so the dream of a house

00:14:26.110 --> 00:14:28.220
in the exurbs which turned
into a nightmare when the

00:14:28.220 --> 00:14:31.100
housing market collapsed.

00:14:31.100 --> 00:14:34.120
You follow all their stories
over the course of these three

00:14:34.120 --> 00:14:38.200
decades while taking little
detours into the lives of the

00:14:38.200 --> 00:14:42.810
celebrities who were sort of
shaping the culture that these

00:14:42.810 --> 00:14:45.970
ordinary people were growing up
in and living in and trying

00:14:45.970 --> 00:14:48.110
to make their way in.

00:14:48.110 --> 00:14:53.790
Dean Price ended up feeling that
he could not make it as

00:14:53.790 --> 00:14:56.780
an independent truck
stop operator and

00:14:56.780 --> 00:14:57.980
had a kind of epiphany.

00:14:57.980 --> 00:15:00.530
His whole life was like a series
of epiphanies, very

00:15:00.530 --> 00:15:04.780
religious in a somewhat
unorthodox way.

00:15:04.780 --> 00:15:05.700
His life was a quest.

00:15:05.700 --> 00:15:07.420
It is a quest.

00:15:07.420 --> 00:15:10.430
And the turning point came
when he realized that the

00:15:10.430 --> 00:15:13.870
answer to the problems
in his area.

00:15:13.870 --> 00:15:19.030
Because his area was tobacco
country, textile country.

00:15:19.030 --> 00:15:20.360
It had mainstays.

00:15:20.360 --> 00:15:25.320
And they went away one by one
in the '90s and early 2000s

00:15:25.320 --> 00:15:29.180
leaving behind a kind of
despoiled landscape.

00:15:29.180 --> 00:15:33.000
And all the problems of the
inner city transferred to

00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:35.130
rural America--

00:15:35.130 --> 00:15:38.810
multiple generations on public
assistance, drug abuse,

00:15:38.810 --> 00:15:43.080
unemployment, out-of-wedlock
birth.

00:15:43.080 --> 00:15:49.410
Dean decided that the answer to
the decline in his corner

00:15:49.410 --> 00:15:52.370
of America was alternative
energy.

00:15:52.370 --> 00:15:56.960
And he became a kind of Johnny
Appleseed for biodiesel, first

00:15:56.960 --> 00:16:01.520
trying out canola seeds as the
source and finally turning to

00:16:01.520 --> 00:16:05.120
waste oil from the many barbecue
restaurants and other

00:16:05.120 --> 00:16:07.710
sources of oil in
North Carolina.

00:16:07.710 --> 00:16:10.510
So I'm just going to finish by
reading one passage that

00:16:10.510 --> 00:16:14.690
catches Dean Price just as he's
making this conversion

00:16:14.690 --> 00:16:19.990
from being a failed truck stop
entrepreneur to a local

00:16:19.990 --> 00:16:21.610
prophet of biodiesel.

00:16:28.250 --> 00:16:32.410
A two-lane asphalt road ran
past the woods, white oak,

00:16:32.410 --> 00:16:35.000
shag bark hickory,
Carolina ash.

00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:37.970
And in the shadows of the trees,
a tobacco barn was year

00:16:37.970 --> 00:16:42.710
by year collapsing on itself,
the metal roof sloping inward,

00:16:42.710 --> 00:16:46.400
pieces of bare siding hanging
loose from nails.

00:16:46.400 --> 00:16:49.420
Nearby, a white clapboard
house with empty windows

00:16:49.420 --> 00:16:52.070
squatted at the roadside
half-smothered in tree

00:16:52.070 --> 00:16:55.930
branches and vines while a
fire-scorched handwritten sign

00:16:55.930 --> 00:16:59.900
on the outside wall still
advertised Crush.

00:16:59.900 --> 00:17:03.970
Farther along, the road took a
turn, and a tidy brick ranch

00:17:03.970 --> 00:17:07.069
house with a big satellite dish
mounted on top stood in

00:17:07.069 --> 00:17:10.130
the golden sunlight of
a red-brown field.

00:17:10.130 --> 00:17:14.119
Another bend, a gentle hill,
deep woods again, then an

00:17:14.119 --> 00:17:17.780
abandoned metal warehouse
alone in a clearing.

00:17:17.780 --> 00:17:20.339
The road straightened and
flattened and came to a

00:17:20.339 --> 00:17:23.460
stoplight where a pair of strip
malls faced each other,

00:17:23.460 --> 00:17:24.520
parking lots full.

00:17:24.520 --> 00:17:29.580
A Walgreen's across from a
McDonald's, shell opposing BP.

00:17:29.580 --> 00:17:30.390
Another light.

00:17:30.390 --> 00:17:31.920
A shuttered car dealership.

00:17:31.920 --> 00:17:35.150
A vast scrapyard with a mountain
of twisted metal and

00:17:35.150 --> 00:17:38.360
stacked timbers next door to a
spinning mill that was being

00:17:38.360 --> 00:17:41.640
methodically gutted like a great
whale and sold off one

00:17:41.640 --> 00:17:43.690
part of the time.

00:17:43.690 --> 00:17:46.610
Then downtown, the lonely
little Main Street, a

00:17:46.610 --> 00:17:50.910
taekwondo studio, a government
benefits office, a closed

00:17:50.910 --> 00:17:54.070
restaurant, a nameless corner
store for rent, two

00:17:54.070 --> 00:17:57.550
pedestrians in four blocks, a
Dollar General that marked the

00:17:57.550 --> 00:17:59.520
far end of town.

00:17:59.520 --> 00:18:03.790
On the other side, the country
opened up at once, the road

00:18:03.790 --> 00:18:07.950
passing fields, corn planted on
one, nothing on the next.

00:18:07.950 --> 00:18:10.050
Weeds and clods of dirt.

00:18:10.050 --> 00:18:13.000
Then a residential development
with two-story look-alike

00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:16.220
houses in neat rows laid out
across someone's former

00:18:16.220 --> 00:18:18.290
tobacco farm.

00:18:18.290 --> 00:18:21.740
And beyond the subdivision,
isolated on acres of grass

00:18:21.740 --> 00:18:24.690
behind a split-rail fence
and a man-made lake, the

00:18:24.690 --> 00:18:30.250
super-sized faux chateau of
a celebrity NASCAR driver.

00:18:30.250 --> 00:18:32.950
The landscape Dean had returned
to, where he planned

00:18:32.950 --> 00:18:37.250
to live out his life, was very
old and also new, as

00:18:37.250 --> 00:18:40.810
particular as anything in
America, and also as generic,

00:18:40.810 --> 00:18:43.460
as beautiful and as ugly.

00:18:43.460 --> 00:18:47.280
In his imagination, it had
become a nightmare, so

00:18:47.280 --> 00:18:50.170
profoundly wrong that
he called it sinful.

00:18:50.170 --> 00:18:53.620
And he hated the sin more than
any casual visitor or distant

00:18:53.620 --> 00:18:55.670
critic possibly could.

00:18:55.670 --> 00:18:59.600
Yet, he also saw here a dream of
redemption so unlikely and

00:18:59.600 --> 00:19:02.820
glorious that it could only
fill the mind's eye of a

00:19:02.820 --> 00:19:05.510
visionary native son.

00:19:05.510 --> 00:19:08.950
Once driving through Cleveland
County, Dean happened to pass

00:19:08.950 --> 00:19:12.000
the hard-shell Baptist church
that his father had once tried

00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:14.730
to get, but failed, the failure
that had broken his

00:19:14.730 --> 00:19:16.790
father's will.

00:19:16.790 --> 00:19:19.520
Dean had gone down with his
father to Cleveland County and

00:19:19.520 --> 00:19:22.310
heard the sermon that he'd given
for his audition back

00:19:22.310 --> 00:19:25.860
around 1975, so that
decades later, he

00:19:25.860 --> 00:19:27.550
recognized the church.

00:19:27.550 --> 00:19:31.250
And he also noticed that there
was now a fucking Bojangles

00:19:31.250 --> 00:19:33.440
right next door.

00:19:33.440 --> 00:19:36.430
For Dean, Bojangles had come to
represent everything that

00:19:36.430 --> 00:19:38.640
was wrong with the way Americans
lived-- how they

00:19:38.640 --> 00:19:41.190
raise their food and transported
it across the

00:19:41.190 --> 00:19:44.130
country, how they grew the crops
to feed the animals they

00:19:44.130 --> 00:19:47.240
ate, the way they employed the
people who worked in the

00:19:47.240 --> 00:19:50.700
restaurants, the way the money
left the community, everything

00:19:50.700 --> 00:19:52.680
about it was wrong.

00:19:52.680 --> 00:19:55.500
Dean's own business, gas
and fast food, had

00:19:55.500 --> 00:19:57.020
become hateful to him.

00:19:57.020 --> 00:20:00.480
And he saw the error of his ways
as his father never had.

00:20:00.480 --> 00:20:03.520
And the conjunction of his
father's legacy and his own

00:20:03.520 --> 00:20:07.340
struck him with bitter irony
as he drove past.

00:20:07.340 --> 00:20:10.140
He was seeing beyond the
surfaces of the land to its

00:20:10.140 --> 00:20:11.970
hidden truths.

00:20:11.970 --> 00:20:15.530
Some nights, he sat up late on
his front porch with a glass

00:20:15.530 --> 00:20:19.310
of Jack and listened to the
trucks heading south on 220,

00:20:19.310 --> 00:20:21.630
carrying crates of live chickens
to the slaughter

00:20:21.630 --> 00:20:25.480
houses always under cover of
darkness like a vast and

00:20:25.480 --> 00:20:29.550
shameful trafficking, chickens
pumped full of hormones that

00:20:29.550 --> 00:20:31.990
left them too big to walk.

00:20:31.990 --> 00:20:34.500
And he thought how these same
chickens might return from

00:20:34.500 --> 00:20:38.050
their destination as pieces of
meat to the floodlit Bojangles

00:20:38.050 --> 00:20:39.920
up the hill from his house.

00:20:39.920 --> 00:20:43.200
And that meat would be drowned
in the bubbling fryers by

00:20:43.200 --> 00:20:45.710
employees whose hatred
of the job would leak

00:20:45.710 --> 00:20:47.530
into the cooked food.

00:20:47.530 --> 00:20:50.610
And that food would be served up
and eaten by customers who

00:20:50.610 --> 00:20:53.940
would grow obese and end up in
the hospital in Greensboro

00:20:53.940 --> 00:20:56.120
with diabetes or heart
failure, a

00:20:56.120 --> 00:20:57.840
burden to the public.

00:20:57.840 --> 00:21:00.820
And later Dean would see them
riding around the Mayodan

00:21:00.820 --> 00:21:03.770
Walmart in electric carts
because they were too heavy to

00:21:03.770 --> 00:21:06.520
walk the aisles of the
super-center, just like a

00:21:06.520 --> 00:21:09.770
hormone-fed chickens.

00:21:09.770 --> 00:21:11.460
So that's Dean Price's vision.

00:21:11.460 --> 00:21:12.920
And it's a dark one.

00:21:12.920 --> 00:21:17.550
But it contains these seeds of
renewal, which he is, as we

00:21:17.550 --> 00:21:21.790
speak, out there pursuing
and selling every day.

00:21:21.790 --> 00:21:25.107
And although there's a dark edge
to this vision of America

00:21:25.107 --> 00:21:30.770
in my book, when I think about
Washington or Wall Street or

00:21:30.770 --> 00:21:32.360
corporate America,
I get depressed.

00:21:32.360 --> 00:21:36.070
But when I'm with someone like
Dean or Tammy Thomas or the

00:21:36.070 --> 00:21:40.880
other characters, I feel more
hopeful because they have this

00:21:40.880 --> 00:21:45.610
resilience and this
resourcefulness that I think

00:21:45.610 --> 00:21:47.810
may not be uniquely American,
but that you find everywhere

00:21:47.810 --> 00:21:50.010
in this country, in the most
out of the way places where

00:21:50.010 --> 00:21:52.630
the media never goes and no
one's paying attention.

00:21:52.630 --> 00:21:56.510
And I wanted to bring those
stories to light as well as to

00:21:56.510 --> 00:21:59.240
describe the larger darkness
in which they're unfolding.

00:21:59.240 --> 00:22:02.090
And that's what "The Unwinding"
is about.

00:22:02.090 --> 00:22:05.600
And if you have any questions
on your lunch hour here, I

00:22:05.600 --> 00:22:06.900
would be very happy
to hear them.

00:22:06.900 --> 00:22:13.140
[APPLAUSE]

00:22:13.140 --> 00:22:13.900
GEORGE PACKER: Yes?

00:22:13.900 --> 00:22:14.960
AUDIENCE: So--

00:22:14.960 --> 00:22:15.794
GEORGE PACKER: Wait
for the mic.

00:22:15.794 --> 00:22:17.610
AUDIENCE: Oh, OK.

00:22:17.610 --> 00:22:20.570
So I think you anticipated my
question with your closing.

00:22:20.570 --> 00:22:23.780
But I'm just curious how
much of a tragic story

00:22:23.780 --> 00:22:24.470
you think this is.

00:22:24.470 --> 00:22:29.080
Because when I hear you describe
this, what really

00:22:29.080 --> 00:22:32.190
comes across, the main threads,
would be class,

00:22:32.190 --> 00:22:34.420
wealth, power, morality.

00:22:34.420 --> 00:22:37.750
And I think back to the story my
grandmother told me growing

00:22:37.750 --> 00:22:38.990
up in the Depression.

00:22:38.990 --> 00:22:42.170
And frankly some of the tragedy
and some of the gross

00:22:42.170 --> 00:22:45.720
injustice that we hear about
today pales in comparison to

00:22:45.720 --> 00:22:46.700
those stories.

00:22:46.700 --> 00:22:50.070
So I'm curious how you think
this compares to historical

00:22:50.070 --> 00:22:50.490
precedence.

00:22:50.490 --> 00:22:50.980
GEORGE PACKER: Right.

00:22:50.980 --> 00:22:52.270
It's a good question.

00:22:52.270 --> 00:22:55.590
I'm really glad to talk about
history because we don't talk

00:22:55.590 --> 00:22:57.510
about it enough in
this country.

00:22:57.510 --> 00:22:59.010
Americans were much
poorer then.

00:22:59.010 --> 00:23:00.230
Life was harder.

00:23:00.230 --> 00:23:01.630
There was no air conditioning.

00:23:01.630 --> 00:23:04.620
Imagine being Dean Price in
North Carolina and having no

00:23:04.620 --> 00:23:08.470
air conditioning, which
transformed the South.

00:23:08.470 --> 00:23:11.990
The food may have been locally
produced, but there probably

00:23:11.990 --> 00:23:14.650
wasn't enough of it, which is
a different problem from

00:23:14.650 --> 00:23:17.840
eating at Bojangles.

00:23:17.840 --> 00:23:22.630
Emaciation may have been more
the problem than obesity.

00:23:22.630 --> 00:23:24.500
A lot of people didn't even
go to school, let

00:23:24.500 --> 00:23:27.630
alone go to bad schools.

00:23:27.630 --> 00:23:33.570
So no one should say this
is as bad as the worst.

00:23:33.570 --> 00:23:37.130
What I feel is that we have
taken a big step back toward

00:23:37.130 --> 00:23:41.990
that by undoing the structures
that were put in place in the

00:23:41.990 --> 00:23:45.100
Depression and afterward, in
the postwar period, which

00:23:45.100 --> 00:23:52.400
supported middle class
aspirations, which gave some

00:23:52.400 --> 00:23:54.870
help and sort of channelled the

00:23:54.870 --> 00:23:56.940
ambitions of ordinary people.

00:23:56.940 --> 00:24:00.330
Those structures have begun
to fold, as I've

00:24:00.330 --> 00:24:02.250
described in the book.

00:24:02.250 --> 00:24:06.230
And although it's created this
tremendous opportunity and

00:24:06.230 --> 00:24:09.010
freedom for people with the
ability, the talent, and the

00:24:09.010 --> 00:24:12.150
luck to take advantage, it's
also left countless Americans

00:24:12.150 --> 00:24:15.550
behind, which is something that
we can forget here in the

00:24:15.550 --> 00:24:19.450
Bay Area, which is one of the
very few parts of the country

00:24:19.450 --> 00:24:22.600
that has really done well over
the last generation.

00:24:22.600 --> 00:24:28.540
So my feeling is we don't need
to look to the Great

00:24:28.540 --> 00:24:31.250
Depression for comparisons.

00:24:31.250 --> 00:24:33.420
I'm worried about the direction
we're going in.

00:24:33.420 --> 00:24:36.510
And it seems to me that if
you've seen "The Great Gatsby"

00:24:36.510 --> 00:24:39.660
or if you've, better yet, read
the novel, which I would

00:24:39.660 --> 00:24:45.070
recommend over the movie any
day, we're getting closer to

00:24:45.070 --> 00:24:50.120
that America where life is lived
through the people at

00:24:50.120 --> 00:24:53.370
the top and through the
celebrities and their stories.

00:24:53.370 --> 00:24:59.840
And ordinary people no longer
see themselves rising with the

00:24:59.840 --> 00:25:00.760
top of society.

00:25:00.760 --> 00:25:03.090
It's more like the top
has risen from

00:25:03.090 --> 00:25:04.590
the rest of the country.

00:25:04.590 --> 00:25:09.360
And the worship of celebrity is
one symptom of the failure

00:25:09.360 --> 00:25:10.150
of institutions.

00:25:10.150 --> 00:25:12.550
As I wrote in the prologue,
celebrities are taking the

00:25:12.550 --> 00:25:13.800
place of institutions.

00:25:16.950 --> 00:25:20.280
Tech billionaires are funding
school systems.

00:25:20.280 --> 00:25:24.220
TV hostesses are floating
the publishing industry.

00:25:24.220 --> 00:25:28.870
And I worry that when these
core institutions are

00:25:28.870 --> 00:25:32.330
personalized that way and depend
so much on the private

00:25:32.330 --> 00:25:37.330
whims and ideals of the most
successful, they're very

00:25:37.330 --> 00:25:39.680
vulnerable.

00:25:39.680 --> 00:25:41.630
AUDIENCE: I was just wondering,
did you learn

00:25:41.630 --> 00:25:43.720
anything from any of your
characters that you weren't

00:25:43.720 --> 00:25:44.680
expecting to learn?

00:25:44.680 --> 00:25:47.420
Or did you come in trying to
tell a narrative that you had

00:25:47.420 --> 00:25:50.350
already had an opinion towards,
and then just pick

00:25:50.350 --> 00:25:52.650
and choose from what they
told you to help you

00:25:52.650 --> 00:25:53.720
tell you that narrative?

00:25:53.720 --> 00:25:54.080
GEORGE PACKER: Right.

00:25:54.080 --> 00:25:56.850
So I'll tell you a little
about my method.

00:25:56.850 --> 00:26:00.650
It's the method of total
immersion, so that I would run

00:26:00.650 --> 00:26:02.330
across someone like
Dean Price.

00:26:02.330 --> 00:26:04.650
I'm working on another
"New Yorker" story.

00:26:04.650 --> 00:26:08.720
And 30 seconds after hearing
him talk on the phone about

00:26:08.720 --> 00:26:12.560
biodiesel, I knew that I needed
to get to know this guy

00:26:12.560 --> 00:26:16.510
because he had both this passion
and articulateness,

00:26:16.510 --> 00:26:22.340
but also admittedly kind of
a salesman's brilliance in

00:26:22.340 --> 00:26:23.590
conveying his vision.

00:26:26.400 --> 00:26:30.280
I went down to North Carolina,
lived in his house, maybe half

00:26:30.280 --> 00:26:33.710
a dozen or eight times, met his
family, hung out with him,

00:26:33.710 --> 00:26:36.270
traveled around the back woods
of North Carolina in his

00:26:36.270 --> 00:26:39.000
beat-up Honda while he went from
county to county trying

00:26:39.000 --> 00:26:42.520
to get local schools to buy
into the idea of using

00:26:42.520 --> 00:26:44.850
biodiesel for school buses.

00:26:44.850 --> 00:26:47.490
And there's no way I could have
had an opinion about any

00:26:47.490 --> 00:26:50.060
of that before I went because
I didn't know any of it.

00:26:50.060 --> 00:26:52.310
It was all discovery.

00:26:52.310 --> 00:26:55.390
Admittedly, I was looking for
stories of Americans who were

00:26:55.390 --> 00:27:00.500
in some way struggling both to
remake themselves and to come

00:27:00.500 --> 00:27:03.460
up with a new vision of their
own part of the country.

00:27:03.460 --> 00:27:06.230
I was interested in people who
are rooted in one place and

00:27:06.230 --> 00:27:09.290
were still focused on that place
rather than had some

00:27:09.290 --> 00:27:12.960
giant idea that applied
everywhere and nowhere.

00:27:12.960 --> 00:27:15.080
And it wasn't always
easy to find them.

00:27:15.080 --> 00:27:20.100
But once you do, you really
get out of the way because

00:27:20.100 --> 00:27:22.460
they're so much more interesting
than whatever

00:27:22.460 --> 00:27:25.670
preconceived ideas I or you
could have about them.

00:27:25.670 --> 00:27:28.360
And the other point about the
method is there's no first

00:27:28.360 --> 00:27:30.620
person anywhere in this book.

00:27:30.620 --> 00:27:34.200
The word I coming from me does
not appear, which is a

00:27:34.200 --> 00:27:36.930
complete departure from my
earlier work and was a really

00:27:36.930 --> 00:27:37.830
important decision.

00:27:37.830 --> 00:27:40.840
And I think it had the great
benefit of giving you the

00:27:40.840 --> 00:27:43.670
feeling that you're
watching a movie.

00:27:43.670 --> 00:27:46.140
And you don't want to be
distracted from that movie.

00:27:46.140 --> 00:27:48.170
If I were to start saying
something about these

00:27:48.170 --> 00:27:51.010
characters in my own voice, it
would be like the guy next to

00:27:51.010 --> 00:27:52.470
you talking in the
middle the film.

00:27:52.470 --> 00:27:53.920
You'd want to shut me up.

00:27:53.920 --> 00:27:57.420
So there's more of a sense, I
think, of discovery and of the

00:27:57.420 --> 00:27:59.620
characters and their language.

00:27:59.620 --> 00:28:01.730
You can kind of hear in that
Dean Price passage, these are

00:28:01.730 --> 00:28:03.370
not really my words
so much as his.

00:28:03.370 --> 00:28:04.820
The word sinful is not a word I

00:28:04.820 --> 00:28:07.190
would've used about Bojangles.

00:28:07.190 --> 00:28:09.060
That's Dean Price.

00:28:09.060 --> 00:28:10.510
Yes?

00:28:10.510 --> 00:28:14.010
AUDIENCE: You were mentioning
how the unwielding was sort of

00:28:14.010 --> 00:28:18.600
setting us back to a time when
these icons were sort of

00:28:18.600 --> 00:28:19.380
leading us.

00:28:19.380 --> 00:28:23.510
And one of the things that
interested me in coming here

00:28:23.510 --> 00:28:25.980
is just the fact that you work
at "The New Yorker." And I

00:28:25.980 --> 00:28:29.440
find that sometimes "The New
Yorker" and a few other

00:28:29.440 --> 00:28:36.240
publications are the ones that
present these sort of reality

00:28:36.240 --> 00:28:38.400
news stories.

00:28:38.400 --> 00:28:42.430
I was wondering, back in the
day when the icons were

00:28:42.430 --> 00:28:46.370
leading, they were the
newspaper owners.

00:28:46.370 --> 00:28:49.140
They were giving us--

00:28:49.140 --> 00:28:50.580
or people who lived then--

00:28:50.580 --> 00:28:51.600
the news.

00:28:51.600 --> 00:28:54.220
So I was wondering, from your
perspective, how much of that

00:28:54.220 --> 00:28:56.020
is happening today, again?

00:28:56.020 --> 00:29:01.600
Is there a return to where the
wealthy, the icons, are

00:29:01.600 --> 00:29:05.310
determining what information
is being delivered?

00:29:05.310 --> 00:29:08.490
And even, I mean, maybe even
at "The New Yorker"--

00:29:08.490 --> 00:29:09.720
I don't know.

00:29:09.720 --> 00:29:11.460
GEORGE PACKER: I'd say two
things are happening at once.

00:29:11.460 --> 00:29:12.640
It's a really good question.

00:29:12.640 --> 00:29:15.440
On the one hand, there's this
tremendous diffusion of

00:29:15.440 --> 00:29:19.390
information, which maybe your
company as much as any other

00:29:19.390 --> 00:29:21.850
force in our society
is responsible for.

00:29:21.850 --> 00:29:25.610
So that more people have more
access to more information

00:29:25.610 --> 00:29:27.060
than at any time in
human history.

00:29:27.060 --> 00:29:33.580
It's the most radical change in
how we think and interact

00:29:33.580 --> 00:29:37.660
with information in,
maybe, ever.

00:29:37.660 --> 00:29:41.880
And I think that is partly a
good thing because it has

00:29:41.880 --> 00:29:44.400
given people who used to
not have any access

00:29:44.400 --> 00:29:46.190
to it a lot of access.

00:29:46.190 --> 00:29:49.500
Google is laying fiber optic
cable in towns around the

00:29:49.500 --> 00:29:52.390
country that don't have it.

00:29:52.390 --> 00:29:55.590
It has also done what
my book describes.

00:29:55.590 --> 00:29:59.560
It has broken up and sort of
fragmented the idea that

00:29:59.560 --> 00:30:04.570
there's a common world we live
in and a common set of facts.

00:30:04.570 --> 00:30:07.110
When I had that long list of
what you're now free to do,

00:30:07.110 --> 00:30:08.760
you're free to get
your own facts.

00:30:08.760 --> 00:30:13.480
Everyone has their own facts
and their own websites and

00:30:13.480 --> 00:30:16.060
Twitter feeds that reinforce
those facts.

00:30:16.060 --> 00:30:20.450
And although that seems
empowering and liberating, it

00:30:20.450 --> 00:30:26.090
also has a negative effect of
fracturing us so that there's

00:30:26.090 --> 00:30:31.020
no place where we can all meet
and have an argument the way

00:30:31.020 --> 00:30:34.490
"Time Magazine" and the "CBS
Evening News" used to kind of

00:30:34.490 --> 00:30:39.330
command the belief of enough
people that there was a world

00:30:39.330 --> 00:30:42.860
in which everyone agreed
they were living in.

00:30:42.860 --> 00:30:46.720
Your question about money and
the news is really well taken.

00:30:46.720 --> 00:30:50.720
I don't know if you've read that
David Koch of the Koch

00:30:50.720 --> 00:30:56.970
brothers, the oil fortune, is
perhaps going to buy Times

00:30:56.970 --> 00:30:57.750
Mirror Company--

00:30:57.750 --> 00:31:00.300
the "LA Times," "Chicago
Tribune," and countless other

00:31:00.300 --> 00:31:02.475
newspapers, radio stations,
TV stations.

00:31:05.080 --> 00:31:07.920
Some of this was made possible
by a law, the 1996

00:31:07.920 --> 00:31:12.720
Telecommunications Act, which
took the lid off how many news

00:31:12.720 --> 00:31:14.340
outlets one company could own.

00:31:14.340 --> 00:31:16.310
And that inevitably led
to consolidation.

00:31:16.310 --> 00:31:22.690
So we have this Google-driven
dispersion and then this

00:31:22.690 --> 00:31:26.680
concentrated wealth-driven
consolidation.

00:31:26.680 --> 00:31:31.110
And I'm not sure, you know,
if there's going to

00:31:31.110 --> 00:31:32.190
be a winner in that.

00:31:32.190 --> 00:31:37.350
But I do think that there was
a period when corporations

00:31:37.350 --> 00:31:41.580
owned news organizations but did
not use them in the same

00:31:41.580 --> 00:31:45.720
way that David Koch will use the
"LA Times" if he gets it.

00:31:45.720 --> 00:31:48.180
Fortunately, "The New Yorker,"
although it's owned by a

00:31:48.180 --> 00:31:50.740
family, is owned by family that
doesn't seem to want to

00:31:50.740 --> 00:31:53.510
tell "The New Yorker"
what to write.

00:31:53.510 --> 00:31:56.500
And that's, I think, a good
thing, because I like what I

00:31:56.500 --> 00:31:58.520
read in "The New Yorker." And
I want it to continue.

00:31:58.520 --> 00:32:00.420
I want to continue
to have a job.

00:32:00.420 --> 00:32:03.350
None of us can ever be sure
of that in this world.

00:32:03.350 --> 00:32:10.800
But it's a very confused and
tumultuous period in the news.

00:32:10.800 --> 00:32:16.250
And there's a reporter in my
book from the "St. Petersburg

00:32:16.250 --> 00:32:18.160
Times" that kind
of represents--

00:32:18.160 --> 00:32:21.670
he's just an old-fashioned shoe
leather reporter in the

00:32:21.670 --> 00:32:25.760
age of Facebook and Twitter,
where his whole job may no

00:32:25.760 --> 00:32:28.680
longer be necessary in the
eyes of his readers.

00:32:28.680 --> 00:32:31.100
And he's still trying
to do what

00:32:31.100 --> 00:32:33.440
reporters have always done.

00:32:33.440 --> 00:32:36.630
AUDIENCE: So you seem to be
referring to this ethos that

00:32:36.630 --> 00:32:41.350
held the country together
pre-1970s, which I think most

00:32:41.350 --> 00:32:44.820
of us recognize as, you know,
that was often a Judeo

00:32:44.820 --> 00:32:48.740
Christian, WASP-y, rather
bigoted ethos.

00:32:48.740 --> 00:32:53.090
And when it's we've liberated
more and more groups to have

00:32:53.090 --> 00:32:57.005
their voice heard or what have
you, I think, you know, some

00:32:57.005 --> 00:32:59.040
would call that action itself a
tipping point, but that was

00:32:59.040 --> 00:33:01.520
more indicative of, like, as you
got more freedoms, as we

00:33:01.520 --> 00:33:04.460
all got more freedoms, we now
have greater responsibilities.

00:33:04.460 --> 00:33:05.940
And there are more people
at the table.

00:33:05.940 --> 00:33:06.890
And it's easier to be

00:33:06.890 --> 00:33:08.980
anonymous when making decisions.

00:33:08.980 --> 00:33:12.880
So do we need a return
to that ethos?

00:33:12.880 --> 00:33:13.600
Do we need a new ethos?

00:33:13.600 --> 00:33:15.410
And who gets to decide that?

00:33:15.410 --> 00:33:17.520
I mean, how does this country
move towards cohesion again

00:33:17.520 --> 00:33:19.330
after this massive fracturing?

00:33:19.330 --> 00:33:20.550
GEORGE PACKER: That's
a great question.

00:33:20.550 --> 00:33:23.630
I think what you're pointing
to is the fact that two

00:33:23.630 --> 00:33:25.930
seemingly contradictory things
have been happening over the

00:33:25.930 --> 00:33:27.730
course of the period
in the unwinding.

00:33:27.730 --> 00:33:31.200
One, greater and greater social
equality, more and more

00:33:31.200 --> 00:33:36.820
groups admitted into the circle
of opportunity, power,

00:33:36.820 --> 00:33:38.300
a place near the top.

00:33:38.300 --> 00:33:40.540
Oprah gave the Harvard
commencement

00:33:40.540 --> 00:33:42.490
address last week.

00:33:42.490 --> 00:33:48.500
Gay boys had just been allowed
to become Boy Scouts.

00:33:48.500 --> 00:33:52.900
And no one would want to go
back to 1960 if that's

00:33:52.900 --> 00:33:53.790
what we would get.

00:33:53.790 --> 00:33:58.180
I would say that that period had
in its own structures the

00:33:58.180 --> 00:33:59.880
tools of self-correction.

00:33:59.880 --> 00:34:02.800
The civil rights period is
a great example of that.

00:34:02.800 --> 00:34:07.540
Within the institutions of
Congress, the media, and

00:34:07.540 --> 00:34:11.639
social movements, there was the
ability to correct this

00:34:11.639 --> 00:34:14.360
gross historical injustice.

00:34:14.360 --> 00:34:18.440
I don't know that we have the
tools to correct what's

00:34:18.440 --> 00:34:21.730
happened alongside this widening
inclusiveness, which

00:34:21.730 --> 00:34:24.060
is widening disparities.

00:34:24.060 --> 00:34:27.980
More and more people can get to
the top, but more and more

00:34:27.980 --> 00:34:30.870
people are never going to get
to the top because we are

00:34:30.870 --> 00:34:32.550
becoming more stratified.

00:34:32.550 --> 00:34:35.040
And where you're born is more
and more where you're going to

00:34:35.040 --> 00:34:40.850
end up, which is to me, such a
threat to a basic conviction

00:34:40.850 --> 00:34:43.060
of Americans and our democracy,
which is equal

00:34:43.060 --> 00:34:43.550
opportunity.

00:34:43.550 --> 00:34:47.739
I mean if there's a bedrock
value alongside freedom, it's

00:34:47.739 --> 00:34:48.780
equality of opportunity.

00:34:48.780 --> 00:34:52.389
I think anyone who looks at the
way the country is going

00:34:52.389 --> 00:34:57.060
today has to admit that
is less and less real.

00:34:57.060 --> 00:34:59.560
So who gets to decide
how we fix that?

00:34:59.560 --> 00:35:00.440
I mean, you do.

00:35:00.440 --> 00:35:01.850
We all do.

00:35:01.850 --> 00:35:06.610
All I want to do was hold up a
mirror and say, read this and

00:35:06.610 --> 00:35:09.740
get a feeling for what it's like
to be in America today,

00:35:09.740 --> 00:35:13.010
and for the years that have kind
of proceeded this moment

00:35:13.010 --> 00:35:14.630
and led to it.

00:35:14.630 --> 00:35:17.650
And I'm not going to tell you,
here are the 10 policy

00:35:17.650 --> 00:35:18.025
prescriptions.

00:35:18.025 --> 00:35:22.050
You will not find an epilogue
that gives you, you know,

00:35:22.050 --> 00:35:25.120
let's get rid of the carried
interest exemption for hedge

00:35:25.120 --> 00:35:26.640
fund manager, although
I think we should.

00:35:29.280 --> 00:35:30.810
It's not that kind of book.

00:35:30.810 --> 00:35:33.870
I hope it reaches you on a
deeper level and tells you

00:35:33.870 --> 00:35:36.660
more like, this is what it feels
like to be alive and in

00:35:36.660 --> 00:35:39.330
America at this moment.

00:35:39.330 --> 00:35:44.720
And maybe that can give readers
a more useful way of

00:35:44.720 --> 00:35:48.240
thinking about your question,
who gets to decide and how do

00:35:48.240 --> 00:35:52.330
we find some new cohesion than
another policy prescription

00:35:52.330 --> 00:35:54.025
book would give you.

00:35:54.025 --> 00:35:59.980
AUDIENCE: Do you think people
would have had a harder time

00:35:59.980 --> 00:36:00.990
empathizing--

00:36:00.990 --> 00:36:03.930
or not really empathizing,
but awareness, right?

00:36:03.930 --> 00:36:05.620
Because you're trying to find
a bunch of different people

00:36:05.620 --> 00:36:06.875
with very different backgrounds
in different

00:36:06.875 --> 00:36:09.470
places in the country that are
in many ways very isolated

00:36:09.470 --> 00:36:11.640
from each other, that maybe
would never run into each

00:36:11.640 --> 00:36:13.660
other that are very different
experiences.

00:36:13.660 --> 00:36:16.550
Do you think, in terms of
people's ability to even

00:36:16.550 --> 00:36:19.725
comprehend that those worlds
exist in our country, do you

00:36:19.725 --> 00:36:22.820
think that is lesser or greater
now than it would have

00:36:22.820 --> 00:36:25.112
been in like the time period
you're pointing to, 25 years

00:36:25.112 --> 00:36:25.720
ago [INAUDIBLE]?

00:36:25.720 --> 00:36:26.830
GEORGE PACKER: I love
that question.

00:36:26.830 --> 00:36:28.760
First of all, it makes
me think--

00:36:28.760 --> 00:36:32.300
two weeks ago, Dean Price and
Tammy Thomas were both staying

00:36:32.300 --> 00:36:33.750
in my house.

00:36:33.750 --> 00:36:36.450
They actually met to
go to a party for

00:36:36.450 --> 00:36:37.560
the book in New York.

00:36:37.560 --> 00:36:40.070
And it was one of
the weirdest--

00:36:40.070 --> 00:36:43.710
imagine the contents of my head
was staying in my house

00:36:43.710 --> 00:36:46.260
and talking to each other.

00:36:46.260 --> 00:36:49.660
It was really crazy
and really fun.

00:36:49.660 --> 00:36:51.800
But your question is more
serious than that.

00:36:51.800 --> 00:36:57.380
And I think it is harder for
Americans to know how other

00:36:57.380 --> 00:36:59.760
Americans live than it used to
be, even though we have all

00:36:59.760 --> 00:37:00.670
kinds of tools--

00:37:00.670 --> 00:37:02.510
YouTube, et cetera--

00:37:02.510 --> 00:37:06.640
just to see it from every
part of the country.

00:37:06.640 --> 00:37:10.550
I found when I was researching
this book, going from Brooklyn

00:37:10.550 --> 00:37:14.080
to Stokesdale, North Carolina
felt in some ways like a

00:37:14.080 --> 00:37:17.910
longer trip than going from
Brooklyn to Rangoon, Burma,

00:37:17.910 --> 00:37:21.120
which I did in 2008,
or Baghdad, even.

00:37:21.120 --> 00:37:23.920
Partly because we are
in the same country.

00:37:23.920 --> 00:37:25.730
We have these common
reference points.

00:37:25.730 --> 00:37:27.550
And yet we're living such
different lives.

00:37:27.550 --> 00:37:28.940
What we eat is different.

00:37:28.940 --> 00:37:30.140
The way we talk is different.

00:37:30.140 --> 00:37:31.920
The way we think--

00:37:31.920 --> 00:37:35.970
not to say homogenization and
the suburbanization of life

00:37:35.970 --> 00:37:37.640
after the war was such
a wonderful thing.

00:37:37.640 --> 00:37:40.080
But you look back and kind of
feel a little nostalgic for an

00:37:40.080 --> 00:37:42.610
America where everyone went
to public school.

00:37:42.610 --> 00:37:45.410
And the quality of public
schools was actually not

00:37:45.410 --> 00:37:48.150
wildly different unless you were
in a really, really poor

00:37:48.150 --> 00:37:49.620
place or a really, really
rich place.

00:37:49.620 --> 00:37:53.470
I went to high school in Palo
Alto in the '70s right before

00:37:53.470 --> 00:37:57.630
Proposition 13 began the gutting
of the tax base for

00:37:57.630 --> 00:37:59.300
education in California.

00:37:59.300 --> 00:38:01.770
Everybody I knew went to public
school except the

00:38:01.770 --> 00:38:04.730
screw-ups who got sent
to a private school.

00:38:04.730 --> 00:38:09.080
Now, I know that private schools
have become a major

00:38:09.080 --> 00:38:12.130
avenue for the new elite
of the Bay Area.

00:38:12.130 --> 00:38:17.080
And I can't help feeling that
we're losing something.

00:38:17.080 --> 00:38:18.540
That our lives-- sorry?

00:38:18.540 --> 00:38:19.910
AUDIENCE: Not just
the Bay Area.

00:38:19.910 --> 00:38:20.940
GEORGE PACKER: I know,
everywhere.

00:38:20.940 --> 00:38:21.920
Everywhere.

00:38:21.920 --> 00:38:27.450
I feel like here, the schools
were so good and were so

00:38:27.450 --> 00:38:31.990
egalitarian in a way that, to
me, it's like a model that has

00:38:31.990 --> 00:38:36.010
been lost right here in our
own neck of the woods.

00:38:36.010 --> 00:38:41.390
But I do think we're divided
and separate in so many

00:38:41.390 --> 00:38:43.190
different ways.

00:38:43.190 --> 00:38:47.570
And it's just a shock when
you leave one of the more

00:38:47.570 --> 00:38:50.630
successful parts of the country
to one of the less.

00:38:50.630 --> 00:38:51.100
AUDIENCE: Two things.

00:38:51.100 --> 00:38:53.780
First, that I think the collapse
of the textile

00:38:53.780 --> 00:38:56.670
industry is one of the
untold stories.

00:38:56.670 --> 00:38:59.100
My wife is from Cleveland
County, North Carolina.

00:38:59.100 --> 00:39:01.240
And so thank you for
telling that.

00:39:01.240 --> 00:39:03.270
GEORGE PACKER: It's a big part
of Dean Price's life, because

00:39:03.270 --> 00:39:05.260
that was the job that was
waiting for you out of high

00:39:05.260 --> 00:39:06.640
school, right?

00:39:06.640 --> 00:39:08.155
AUDIENCE: And all those plants
are just, you know, they're

00:39:08.155 --> 00:39:09.550
empty, closed.

00:39:09.550 --> 00:39:12.050
I mean, you've been
there and seen it.

00:39:12.050 --> 00:39:15.040
But I was wondering, as you're
riding around with Dean Price

00:39:15.040 --> 00:39:18.436
or other people, you know,s and
he's talking to people, do

00:39:18.436 --> 00:39:20.880
any of them say, who's this
guy and what's he doing?

00:39:20.880 --> 00:39:21.820
What are you doing?

00:39:21.820 --> 00:39:22.870
What are you doing
with that pad?

00:39:22.870 --> 00:39:23.836
GEORGE PACKER: Hell, yes.

00:39:23.836 --> 00:39:24.320
Hell, yes.

00:39:24.320 --> 00:39:26.100
AUDIENCE: What are you doing
with that tape recorder?

00:39:26.100 --> 00:39:28.940
GEORGE PACKER: I had to
explain it every time.

00:39:28.940 --> 00:39:34.020
Fortunately, most people,
especially in small towns and

00:39:34.020 --> 00:39:39.750
rural America, are less
suspicious of journalists than

00:39:39.750 --> 00:39:44.630
the White House, Facebook,
and Goldman Sachs.

00:39:44.630 --> 00:39:48.350
So rather than having to set a
whole bunch of ground rules

00:39:48.350 --> 00:39:51.340
and then run quotes by them for
their approval, which is

00:39:51.340 --> 00:39:54.180
what reporters routinely do
now-- and it's actually quite

00:39:54.180 --> 00:39:57.540
a corrupt system where the
source gets to rewrite the

00:39:57.540 --> 00:40:00.630
quote as per the original ground
rules, but that's like

00:40:00.630 --> 00:40:05.900
the power that institutions
we want to cover have--

00:40:05.900 --> 00:40:09.640
if you're a decent person and
are truly interested--

00:40:09.640 --> 00:40:11.780
not just pretending, because
they'll pick that up-- if

00:40:11.780 --> 00:40:15.160
you're truly interested and
have some empathy, I have

00:40:15.160 --> 00:40:19.230
always found whether it's in
Surry County, North Carolina

00:40:19.230 --> 00:40:23.460
or Kirkuk, Iraq, people want
to tell their story.

00:40:23.460 --> 00:40:27.360
And it's only when they're in
a sort of quasi official

00:40:27.360 --> 00:40:29.740
position that they get nervous
that it's going to come back

00:40:29.740 --> 00:40:30.920
to bite them.

00:40:30.920 --> 00:40:33.390
Most of the people Dean was
talking to were, like, tobacco

00:40:33.390 --> 00:40:38.330
farmers, former textile
or furniture workers.

00:40:38.330 --> 00:40:39.270
They were OK with it.

00:40:39.270 --> 00:40:43.790
And so far, I haven't heard
anyone telling me that I

00:40:43.790 --> 00:40:44.690
destroyed their life.

00:40:44.690 --> 00:40:46.420
And I hope I haven't.

00:40:46.420 --> 00:40:48.870
AUDIENCE: So clearly you wrote
the book from a very

00:40:48.870 --> 00:40:49.790
US-centric--

00:40:49.790 --> 00:40:51.550
you're telling a story about
the United States.

00:40:51.550 --> 00:40:56.330
But I'm curious if there were
any problems or themes that

00:40:56.330 --> 00:40:59.950
you think could be applied at
a more global scale, like

00:40:59.950 --> 00:41:02.550
things you've seen in your
travels or solutions that you

00:41:02.550 --> 00:41:04.510
thought might be applied
globally?

00:41:04.510 --> 00:41:07.430
GEORGE PACKER: You know, you're
getting at perhaps a

00:41:07.430 --> 00:41:11.700
weakness in the book, which is
it is so much about the US and

00:41:11.700 --> 00:41:17.130
my literary model was John Dos
Passos trilogy "U.S.A.," which

00:41:17.130 --> 00:41:21.450
is about the first decades
of the 20th century,

00:41:21.450 --> 00:41:23.170
a trilogy of novels.

00:41:23.170 --> 00:41:28.440
That the Iraq War has a little
place in my book, but I'd

00:41:28.440 --> 00:41:30.260
already written a book
about the Iraq War.

00:41:30.260 --> 00:41:31.820
Do I need to do that again?

00:41:31.820 --> 00:41:33.270
Iran Contra is mentioned.

00:41:33.270 --> 00:41:36.780
It's like you're seeing the
world and the big events of

00:41:36.780 --> 00:41:41.460
history out of your peripheral
vision while you're living

00:41:41.460 --> 00:41:43.030
through the lives of
these characters.

00:41:43.030 --> 00:41:48.320
And I guess I'd say I learned
how insular Americans are.

00:41:48.320 --> 00:41:53.150
My characters were not talking
about the wars very much.

00:41:53.150 --> 00:41:55.430
They weren't talking
about globalization

00:41:55.430 --> 00:41:57.150
and India and China.

00:41:57.150 --> 00:41:59.260
They were talking about what
was happening in their

00:41:59.260 --> 00:42:00.030
neighborhood.

00:42:00.030 --> 00:42:03.260
And that, it may be a human
trait, b but I think it's also

00:42:03.260 --> 00:42:04.140
an American trait.

00:42:04.140 --> 00:42:07.110
We're so big and surrounded
by oceans.

00:42:07.110 --> 00:42:08.910
And there's so much
going on here.

00:42:08.910 --> 00:42:13.240
And we're so obsessed with
ourselves that honestly the

00:42:13.240 --> 00:42:15.440
rest of the world kind of
disappeared during these

00:42:15.440 --> 00:42:16.850
conversations I had.

00:42:16.850 --> 00:42:20.570
And so, in being true to
the point of view of my

00:42:20.570 --> 00:42:25.820
characters, I let the world
sort of slip away.

00:42:25.820 --> 00:42:30.100
I think the best point of
comparison is Europe where

00:42:30.100 --> 00:42:34.750
there have been unwindings
across the continent,

00:42:34.750 --> 00:42:37.370
especially since the
financial crisis.

00:42:37.370 --> 00:42:40.560
But where a country like Germany
has somehow decided to

00:42:40.560 --> 00:42:44.620
hold on to certain institutional
constraints that

00:42:44.620 --> 00:42:49.180
keep society from completely
fracturing.

00:42:49.180 --> 00:42:53.080
So that after the financial
crisis and the recession, they

00:42:53.080 --> 00:42:56.450
had these job-share plans where
people worked fewer

00:42:56.450 --> 00:42:58.190
days, but more people
got to work.

00:42:58.190 --> 00:43:00.420
And that was a decision the
German government made in

00:43:00.420 --> 00:43:02.110
order to make sure unemployment

00:43:02.110 --> 00:43:03.030
didn't get out of control.

00:43:03.030 --> 00:43:06.420
That's just one of many policy
decisions that tell you

00:43:06.420 --> 00:43:09.350
globalization is not the only
cause of these things.

00:43:09.350 --> 00:43:12.790
There are also decisions made
by governments and by

00:43:12.790 --> 00:43:19.320
businesses that drive the forces
that are causing this

00:43:19.320 --> 00:43:20.160
falling apart.

00:43:20.160 --> 00:43:22.870
And Germany's a very good
counter example to the path

00:43:22.870 --> 00:43:23.680
that we've taken.

00:43:23.680 --> 00:43:24.720
But it's not in the book.

00:43:24.720 --> 00:43:28.960
The book is very much, as you
can see, about our country.

00:43:28.960 --> 00:43:30.870
One more question here?

00:43:30.870 --> 00:43:32.640
AUDIENCE: You talked a bit
about Silicon Valley

00:43:32.640 --> 00:43:34.960
entrepreneurs benefiting
from this.

00:43:34.960 --> 00:43:39.190
Can you talk a bit about how
you feel, if any, Silicon

00:43:39.190 --> 00:43:41.820
Valley has contributed to
the unwinding at all?

00:43:41.820 --> 00:43:42.880
GEORGE PACKER: That's
a great question.

00:43:42.880 --> 00:43:45.280
You might have heard that I
wrote an article in "The New

00:43:45.280 --> 00:43:47.400
Yorker" a couple weeks ago
that's kind of about how

00:43:47.400 --> 00:43:50.870
Silicon Valley is getting more
involved in politics and

00:43:50.870 --> 00:43:52.120
what's driving that.

00:43:54.550 --> 00:43:57.890
My feeling about Silicon Valley
is it's good, but it's

00:43:57.890 --> 00:43:59.140
not enough.

00:43:59.140 --> 00:44:03.470
It's done great things for
a lot of individuals.

00:44:03.470 --> 00:44:06.360
But in the grand scheme of
things, the employment level

00:44:06.360 --> 00:44:10.100
is so small compared
to General Motors.

00:44:10.100 --> 00:44:14.200
Twitter, which dominates my
world of media, has-- what--

00:44:14.200 --> 00:44:17.380
like 900 employees here
in San Francisco.

00:44:17.380 --> 00:44:23.350
Google is far bigger, and not to
curry any favor here, but I

00:44:23.350 --> 00:44:29.630
think Google may be the one of
the new tech companies that

00:44:29.630 --> 00:44:32.470
sort of is looking more
like the economy

00:44:32.470 --> 00:44:34.820
that has been replaced.

00:44:34.820 --> 00:44:37.510
I don't think social
networking--

00:44:37.510 --> 00:44:38.660
I'm a skeptic.

00:44:38.660 --> 00:44:42.340
I don't think it's going
to drive middle-class

00:44:42.340 --> 00:44:43.305
standard of living up.

00:44:43.305 --> 00:44:47.090
I think what it does is gives us
lots and lots of wonderful

00:44:47.090 --> 00:44:51.760
tools and massive distraction,
even addiction.

00:44:51.760 --> 00:44:54.630
I know that for my own life,
this thing owns me.

00:44:54.630 --> 00:44:57.830
And it may be that it--

00:44:57.830 --> 00:45:00.120
I walk around the streets here
and everyone is staring at

00:45:00.120 --> 00:45:00.940
their phone.

00:45:00.940 --> 00:45:04.260
It's kind of like a picture of
the unwinding, like no one is

00:45:04.260 --> 00:45:06.340
talking to each other, no one
is looking at each other.

00:45:06.340 --> 00:45:14.490
I think virtual technology has
sort of created conditions

00:45:14.490 --> 00:45:21.280
where we are more divided from
each other in life and maybe

00:45:21.280 --> 00:45:24.960
were connected in all kinds
of ways, as well.

00:45:24.960 --> 00:45:27.650
Peter Thiel is in my book
because he's one big figure

00:45:27.650 --> 00:45:30.830
out here, a libertarian,
not my politics at all.

00:45:30.830 --> 00:45:34.100
But he's a critic of
the boosterism of

00:45:34.100 --> 00:45:34.890
the Information Age.

00:45:34.890 --> 00:45:36.340
He says it just hasn't
raised living

00:45:36.340 --> 00:45:37.490
standards across the country.

00:45:37.490 --> 00:45:39.670
In fact, it's coincided with
the hollowing out of the

00:45:39.670 --> 00:45:40.300
middle class.

00:45:40.300 --> 00:45:41.900
It's a very hard thing
to explain.

00:45:41.900 --> 00:45:45.530
How is it that this revolution
that has changed life in the

00:45:45.530 --> 00:45:48.230
way Americans and people around
the world live has not

00:45:48.230 --> 00:45:53.220
changed or improved the fortunes
of the broad middle

00:45:53.220 --> 00:45:56.870
class in America the way
the Automobile Age did?

00:45:56.870 --> 00:45:57.630
And that's something--

00:45:57.630 --> 00:45:59.890
I don't have an answer, but it
may be something that you all

00:45:59.890 --> 00:46:03.030
will want to think about and
talk to each other about.

00:46:03.030 --> 00:46:07.900
Because to me, it's very much a
question for Silicon Valley.

00:46:07.900 --> 00:46:09.380
Thanks so much for coming.

00:46:09.380 --> 00:46:10.280
I appreciate you taking
the time.

00:46:10.280 --> 00:46:14.807
[APPLAUSE]
