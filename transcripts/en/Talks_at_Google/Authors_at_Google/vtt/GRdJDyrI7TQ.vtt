SACHIT EGAN: Hello everyone.

00:00:04.240 --> 00:00:05.470
Welcome to Talks at Google.

00:00:05.470 --> 00:00:06.740
My name is Sachit Egan.

00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:09.270
Thanks for being out here today.

00:00:09.270 --> 00:00:11.910
I'm really excited about the
hour we have ahead of us.

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:16.260
And it's my privilege today
to introduce Karan Bajaj.

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:18.680
Karan has been the
Chief Marketing Officer

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:20.820
at Aden &amp; Anais in New York.

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:23.820
He's also worked as a director
for Kraft Foods, a brand

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:27.070
manager for Procter and Gamble,
and is a management consultant

00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:30.240
for Boston Consulting Group
in India, the Philippines,

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:32.400
Singapore, and here in the US.

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:36.330
In 2007, he was named a top
40 under 40 marketer in the US

00:00:36.330 --> 00:00:37.990
by "Advertising Age."

00:00:37.990 --> 00:00:40.290
And he was selected as one
of the top 10 young business

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:44.450
leaders in India by the
Aditya Birla Foundation.

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:47.450
Karan has authored three
novels-- "Keep Off the Grass"

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:50.420
in 2008, which was a
semifinalist for the Amazon

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:54.269
Breakthrough Novel Award,
"Johnny Gone Down" in 2010,

00:00:54.269 --> 00:00:55.810
and "The Seeker,"
which was published

00:00:55.810 --> 00:00:58.400
in India this past year.

00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:01.160
And "The Seeker" has now
just been published in the US

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:04.560
this past month as "the
Yoga of Max's Discontent."

00:01:04.560 --> 00:01:06.080
And also worth
noting that Karan is

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:09.090
going to take over as CEO of
a major media company in India

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:11.680
later this year.

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:13.920
Before I invite Karan
up, I'd be really remiss

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:17.250
if I didn't say I've been really
fortunate with Talks at Google

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:20.040
to read a lot of books, many
of them "New York Times"

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:22.310
bestsellers, number
one bestsellers.

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:24.384
But the "Yoga of Max's
Discontent," far and away

00:01:24.384 --> 00:01:25.550
the best one that I've read.

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:27.840
So we've got it for sale here.

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:29.876
I highly encourage
you to check it out.

00:01:29.876 --> 00:01:32.169
Karan will talk for
about 15 minutes.

00:01:32.169 --> 00:01:33.460
Then I'll do some Q&amp;A with him.

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:35.560
And then we'll take
questions from the audience.

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:38.900
Without further ado, please help
me welcome Karan to the stage.

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:40.490
KARAN BAJAJ: Thank you.

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:40.990
Thank you.

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:41.500
Thank you, Sachit.

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:42.350
Thank you for having me.

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:44.183
Does he say that for
every talk, by the way,

00:01:44.183 --> 00:01:48.089
like it's the best book
I've ever read in my life?

00:01:48.089 --> 00:01:49.130
I'm delighted to be here.

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:52.230
So I'll speak for a few minutes
before we go into the Q&amp;A.

00:01:52.230 --> 00:01:54.270
So I wanted to start
with a question.

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:56.190
How many of you
have ever fantasized

00:01:56.190 --> 00:01:58.773
about leaving it all
behind-- your job,

00:01:58.773 --> 00:02:00.170
your career, everybody?

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:02.440
So my goal really in
the next 20 minutes

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:05.690
is to convince you
to do it today.

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:07.280
So bear with me as
I speak to this.

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:09.269
I'm going to talk a
little bit about what

00:02:09.269 --> 00:02:11.060
I've been doing over
the last decade, which

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:13.900
is what I call a four, one, four
model in which I work for four

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:15.600
years, take a year off,
then work for four years,

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:16.266
take a year off.

00:02:16.266 --> 00:02:18.480
I'm going to talk
about why I do it,

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:21.520
and then perhaps why it might
be an interesting idea for you

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:23.230
to consider.

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:25.480
So that was the
purpose of this talk.

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:28.380
And this idea came to me
like about a decade ago

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:34.510
when I was thinking that
me, like many people,

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:37.330
wanted my life to be like this.

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:41.199
I wanted every career move
that I made, every job location

00:02:41.199 --> 00:02:42.740
I changed, from
India to Philippines,

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:44.920
I wanted everything
to just work out.

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:47.760
I wanted everything to
be successful and right.

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:50.980
And I wanted my life to be
one linear line of growth

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:52.380
and progression.

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:54.280
That's what I realized
that I wanted.

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:56.200
But then you look at
successful people--

00:02:56.200 --> 00:02:59.340
and many of you in this
room are successful-- you

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:02.520
see that this is what successful
people's lives look like.

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:07.420
They do some great things, then
they stumble badly, like Steve

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:09.360
Jobs or whoever you think of.

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:11.770
Then they pick up the pieces
again and then do something

00:03:11.770 --> 00:03:13.181
again, then this jumble again.

00:03:13.181 --> 00:03:15.430
And then they reach kind of
like a height of greatness

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:19.424
that the linear line
never reaches you to.

00:03:19.424 --> 00:03:21.340
So obviously we all know
failure is important.

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:22.480
It makes you humble again.

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:23.480
It makes you a beginner.

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:27.309
It makes you try out new
things and expand your horizons

00:03:27.309 --> 00:03:28.100
and all that stuff.

00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:32.820
And I was wondering, how
do I almost build failure

00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:36.350
into my life rather than
waiting for external events

00:03:36.350 --> 00:03:39.660
to make me feel almost-- so
I was almost thinking on,

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:41.740
is there a way to build
this into your life,

00:03:41.740 --> 00:03:45.550
this idea of being
a beginner again,

00:03:45.550 --> 00:03:49.060
this deconstructing completely,
losing your sense of I

00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:52.660
know anything at all, and
feeling that kind of bottom--

00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:54.020
hit the bottom almost willfully.

00:03:54.020 --> 00:03:57.249
So I started this idea, and it
didn't start like this four,

00:03:57.249 --> 00:03:58.290
one, four perfect system.

00:03:58.290 --> 00:04:00.690
But I was like
every few years, I'm

00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:02.970
going to leave
everything behind.

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:04.210
I'm going to leave my job.

00:04:04.210 --> 00:04:06.230
I'm going to leave
my comfortable house.

00:04:06.230 --> 00:04:09.930
I'm going to leave everything
behind and be a beginner once

00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:11.030
again.

00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:12.540
So I started to
play with this idea.

00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:15.819
And about, I think, 12 years
ago I took my first sabbatical,

00:04:15.819 --> 00:04:18.110
in which I did exactly that
with these three principles

00:04:18.110 --> 00:04:19.915
that have actually
surprisingly not changed all

00:04:19.915 --> 00:04:20.920
that much in all these years.

00:04:20.920 --> 00:04:22.760
The content of the
sabbaticals have changed,

00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:25.400
but the principles
haven't changed.

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:28.050
My first idea was that I
want to be a beginner, so

00:04:28.050 --> 00:04:31.580
let me learn something that
is completely new for me

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:34.662
and feel the humility of
being a beginner again.

00:04:34.662 --> 00:04:36.370
And that was kind of
the first principle.

00:04:36.370 --> 00:04:39.510
The second idea was that I
want to be physically very

00:04:39.510 --> 00:04:42.640
uncomfortable, because what I
was noticing with my life is

00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:46.120
that the moment you reach
a basic level of comfort--

00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:47.830
I guess you have a house, a job.

00:04:47.830 --> 00:04:51.150
You start adding layers
and layers on top of it.

00:04:51.150 --> 00:04:53.270
You know, you're like, I
want to be in this school

00:04:53.270 --> 00:04:56.240
district for my kids.

00:04:56.240 --> 00:04:57.230
I'm a vegetarian.

00:04:57.230 --> 00:04:58.370
I love organic food.

00:04:58.370 --> 00:04:59.590
I have to have green juices.

00:04:59.590 --> 00:05:01.298
There has to be a
Whole Foods next to me.

00:05:01.298 --> 00:05:03.700
You start adding all these
layers into your life.

00:05:03.700 --> 00:05:07.120
And I wanted to break
that construct completely

00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:10.280
and ask myself, what do
I really need to survive.

00:05:10.280 --> 00:05:13.230
And so the idea that
I was playing with

00:05:13.230 --> 00:05:18.420
is, how do I become
completely poor again almost,

00:05:18.420 --> 00:05:20.270
and see what it takes.

00:05:20.270 --> 00:05:22.900
So for example in
the last sabbatical,

00:05:22.900 --> 00:05:26.030
my wife and I spent six months
in an ashram in the Himalayas

00:05:26.030 --> 00:05:28.494
living on the
floor of the ashram

00:05:28.494 --> 00:05:29.910
and taking cold
showers every day.

00:05:29.910 --> 00:05:30.952
And it's very liberating.

00:05:30.952 --> 00:05:33.285
I was playing with this idea
and I found again and again

00:05:33.285 --> 00:05:35.630
that it's very liberating,
that when you do that,

00:05:35.630 --> 00:05:37.316
you come back with
a very heightened

00:05:37.316 --> 00:05:38.940
sense of perspective
about what matters

00:05:38.940 --> 00:05:39.940
and what doesn't matter.

00:05:39.940 --> 00:05:42.040
And you make very authentic
choices to yourself.

00:05:42.040 --> 00:05:43.790
And we'll talk a little
bit more about it.

00:05:43.790 --> 00:05:45.756
But that was the other idea.

00:05:45.756 --> 00:05:47.380
And then the third
idea was that we all

00:05:47.380 --> 00:05:49.760
have this impulse to create.

00:05:49.760 --> 00:05:54.110
And that's what makes us leave
companies and open our startups

00:05:54.110 --> 00:05:55.270
and all that stuff.

00:05:55.270 --> 00:05:58.490
And I wanted to, again,
feel that impulse to create,

00:05:58.490 --> 00:06:01.230
but without any goals associated
with that creation at all.

00:06:01.230 --> 00:06:03.920
So I didn't want to-- I
wanted to play with things

00:06:03.920 --> 00:06:07.130
without having this idea
that I have to get VC funding

00:06:07.130 --> 00:06:08.090
or make it successful.

00:06:08.090 --> 00:06:10.550
I wanted to be
consciously goalless

00:06:10.550 --> 00:06:14.190
and just feel creation
in its purest form.

00:06:14.190 --> 00:06:15.820
And so that's why
this idea was that I

00:06:15.820 --> 00:06:17.967
would take a year off
and come back again, so

00:06:17.967 --> 00:06:19.800
that I have no goals
tied with this creation

00:06:19.800 --> 00:06:22.970
apart from just feeling it.

00:06:22.970 --> 00:06:25.950
So I've done three of these
over the period of the last 12

00:06:25.950 --> 00:06:26.450
years.

00:06:26.450 --> 00:06:27.900
And they've ended up
being four, one, four.

00:06:27.900 --> 00:06:29.733
I wasn't that mathematical
at the beginning,

00:06:29.733 --> 00:06:31.920
but it ended up being this
every three, four years,

00:06:31.920 --> 00:06:35.090
I have this feeling that my
life has too many attachments.

00:06:35.090 --> 00:06:37.800
I'm weighed down by
my views about things.

00:06:37.800 --> 00:06:39.850
I'm forming a very
solid sense of myself,

00:06:39.850 --> 00:06:41.890
and let me break
that down completely

00:06:41.890 --> 00:06:45.160
and become zero again.

00:06:45.160 --> 00:06:49.860
So over the last decade,
this is what's happened.

00:06:49.860 --> 00:06:51.880
I started with the usual stuff.

00:06:51.880 --> 00:06:53.770
I quit my job at Procter
&amp; Gamble that time

00:06:53.770 --> 00:06:54.790
and started traveling.

00:06:54.790 --> 00:06:57.151
And I went backpacking
and the usual stuff.

00:06:57.151 --> 00:06:59.650
Basically I lived in places
that I'd always fantasized about

00:06:59.650 --> 00:07:02.241
like Bhutan and Mongolia,
for no apparent reason,

00:07:02.241 --> 00:07:03.240
but I just should do it.

00:07:03.240 --> 00:07:06.200
And then I started to write.

00:07:06.200 --> 00:07:09.730
And this is funny because
till 27 years of my life,

00:07:09.730 --> 00:07:12.210
I had probably not written
a single creative word.

00:07:12.210 --> 00:07:14.960
And at 28, I started
writing a novel.

00:07:14.960 --> 00:07:18.416
And kind of like
it just happened,

00:07:18.416 --> 00:07:20.040
and then I wrote a
novel which actually

00:07:20.040 --> 00:07:21.081
did pretty well in India.

00:07:21.081 --> 00:07:23.610
And things started to change.

00:07:23.610 --> 00:07:25.520
And then that kind of
planted this idea to me

00:07:25.520 --> 00:07:28.180
that you just don't
even know what you're

00:07:28.180 --> 00:07:31.202
capable of until you kind of
break down the structures that

00:07:31.202 --> 00:07:33.660
surround you, because I'd never
even knew that I could even

00:07:33.660 --> 00:07:34.300
write a novel.

00:07:34.300 --> 00:07:37.690
Like I had no impulse
as a kid to write.

00:07:37.690 --> 00:07:39.460
But I had the space
that opened up.

00:07:39.460 --> 00:07:42.230
I realized that I was feeling
a little empty while traveling,

00:07:42.230 --> 00:07:43.605
because I just
didn't want to see

00:07:43.605 --> 00:07:45.410
the 15th cathedral in Germany.

00:07:45.410 --> 00:07:48.209
Like I just didn't have any--
and that opened up the space.

00:07:48.209 --> 00:07:49.000
I started to write.

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:51.060
It became something.

00:07:51.060 --> 00:07:53.010
And then I started
see that I was

00:07:53.010 --> 00:07:55.430
getting even attached
to this idea of writing.

00:07:55.430 --> 00:07:57.270
And every sabbatical
I would write a novel.

00:07:57.270 --> 00:07:59.436
So I kind of broke that
down in the last sabbatical.

00:07:59.436 --> 00:08:04.197
I even broke this idea that I
had to write anything at all.

00:08:04.197 --> 00:08:06.030
For the first nine
months of this 12 months,

00:08:06.030 --> 00:08:06.960
I was just drifting.

00:08:06.960 --> 00:08:09.370
And I became a yoga teacher,
a meditation teacher,

00:08:09.370 --> 00:08:11.172
or learned yoga and
meditation rather.

00:08:11.172 --> 00:08:12.630
And in the last
two or three months

00:08:12.630 --> 00:08:15.570
I wrote this novel, which
I completed once I actually

00:08:15.570 --> 00:08:16.100
came back.

00:08:20.330 --> 00:08:22.900
Like every time I
do that, I learn

00:08:22.900 --> 00:08:24.800
things in completely new space.

00:08:24.800 --> 00:08:26.086
Like I learned writing.

00:08:26.086 --> 00:08:26.710
I learned yoga.

00:08:26.710 --> 00:08:29.789
I learned meditation, in
very, very great depth.

00:08:29.789 --> 00:08:31.830
The funny part that I
wanted to talk about though

00:08:31.830 --> 00:08:36.169
was something else, which
is through all of this time,

00:08:36.169 --> 00:08:41.250
I felt that my career would
really derail completely,

00:08:41.250 --> 00:08:43.886
because I was like, who wants
this guy who they can't trust

00:08:43.886 --> 00:08:46.510
because he works for four years
and then he disappears and goes

00:08:46.510 --> 00:08:47.649
to the Himalayas.

00:08:47.649 --> 00:08:49.440
And I thought my career
would either derail

00:08:49.440 --> 00:08:51.156
or at best I'd be
like, please give me

00:08:51.156 --> 00:08:52.280
a job back sort of a thing.

00:08:52.280 --> 00:08:54.370
But the funny phenomenon
that I started

00:08:54.370 --> 00:08:57.570
to notice-- with
all my humility I

00:08:57.570 --> 00:09:00.140
guess-- but the funny
phenomenon I started to notice

00:09:00.140 --> 00:09:03.144
was that my career was actually
quite stable before that.

00:09:03.144 --> 00:09:04.560
I was working for
Procter &amp; Gamble

00:09:04.560 --> 00:09:06.850
and I was doing reasonably well.

00:09:06.850 --> 00:09:09.770
And suddenly when I started
doing these sabbaticals,

00:09:09.770 --> 00:09:12.129
I came back and
just accelerated.

00:09:12.129 --> 00:09:13.670
The first time it
happened, I thought

00:09:13.670 --> 00:09:15.990
it was very lucky,
like I had not

00:09:15.990 --> 00:09:18.427
paid the dues of
taking this time off.

00:09:18.427 --> 00:09:20.510
And then the next time I
did it, I came back again

00:09:20.510 --> 00:09:24.350
and I saw that my promotions
were happening faster than I

00:09:24.350 --> 00:09:26.170
ever was being promoted before.

00:09:26.170 --> 00:09:28.360
I was just on this
very accelerated

00:09:28.360 --> 00:09:29.280
curve again and again.

00:09:29.280 --> 00:09:32.530
So at P&amp;G, I was like a
manager, assistant manager.

00:09:32.530 --> 00:09:35.210
And then suddenly I
came back, joined BCG,

00:09:35.210 --> 00:09:37.309
got promoted quickly,
became director, then

00:09:37.309 --> 00:09:38.600
became chief marketing officer.

00:09:38.600 --> 00:09:40.266
Now I'm taking on the
CEO kind of thing.

00:09:40.266 --> 00:09:44.230
Every time I've come back
from these sabbaticals--

00:09:44.230 --> 00:09:46.020
so I started in the
last few as kind

00:09:46.020 --> 00:09:48.780
of starting to reflect on why
this is happening, which is I

00:09:48.780 --> 00:09:50.655
think the reason I wanted
to talk to you guys

00:09:50.655 --> 00:09:53.310
about because you guys are
all-- obviously you're here

00:09:53.310 --> 00:09:54.410
in this prestigious place.

00:09:54.410 --> 00:09:57.330
You're very ambitious
and career focused.

00:09:57.330 --> 00:09:59.030
And this is not like
the hippie track.

00:09:59.030 --> 00:10:02.220
I almost feel it's a brilliant
thing that can actually

00:10:02.220 --> 00:10:03.706
transform every
part of your life.

00:10:03.706 --> 00:10:06.080
Not just the new skills that
you're learning as a writer,

00:10:06.080 --> 00:10:07.496
as a yoga teacher,
but it actually

00:10:07.496 --> 00:10:10.080
impacts your career in the
most positive way possible.

00:10:10.080 --> 00:10:14.107
And I have some hypothesis
on why that has happened,

00:10:14.107 --> 00:10:15.690
which could be
interesting-- and these

00:10:15.690 --> 00:10:17.780
are just hypothesis
right now-- is

00:10:17.780 --> 00:10:20.870
that the first hypothesis
that you actually

00:10:20.870 --> 00:10:24.410
deepen a lot as a person.

00:10:24.410 --> 00:10:26.227
For example, taking
just one activity

00:10:26.227 --> 00:10:28.310
of the sabbatical, when I
think of writing novels,

00:10:28.310 --> 00:10:32.480
every time I write one
book, it completely

00:10:32.480 --> 00:10:35.870
draws into the well
of everything I know.

00:10:35.870 --> 00:10:37.370
And I put all of
that into a book,

00:10:37.370 --> 00:10:40.450
and I'm completely dry
and empty after that.

00:10:40.450 --> 00:10:43.270
And then my natural impulse
is to fill that well

00:10:43.270 --> 00:10:45.556
with a whole breadth of
new experiences again.

00:10:45.556 --> 00:10:47.930
And if I had never done that
creative activity of writing

00:10:47.930 --> 00:10:50.930
a book or something like that,
I would never have had the,

00:10:50.930 --> 00:10:54.560
I guess, impulse
to try a hundred

00:10:54.560 --> 00:10:57.350
different new experiences in
order to fill the well again.

00:10:57.350 --> 00:11:01.309
And again and again I'm seeing
that with this kind of model,

00:11:01.309 --> 00:11:03.350
when you're doing an
activity which is completely

00:11:03.350 --> 00:11:04.160
different from your
work and you're

00:11:04.160 --> 00:11:06.830
putting all your kind of
creative energy into it,

00:11:06.830 --> 00:11:08.550
you need to replenish it.

00:11:08.550 --> 00:11:11.720
And that gives your life
a natural kind of depth

00:11:11.720 --> 00:11:15.810
because you are always seeking
growth, seeking experiences,

00:11:15.810 --> 00:11:19.160
and it becomes a very
important part of your life.

00:11:19.160 --> 00:11:22.440
And then what starts to happen
is that over a period of time,

00:11:22.440 --> 00:11:26.470
all these dots start to connect,
because obviously learning

00:11:26.470 --> 00:11:29.910
yoga and meditation does have
an effect on your personality.

00:11:29.910 --> 00:11:31.670
And that shows up in work.

00:11:31.670 --> 00:11:34.520
And then even small things like
if I'm marketing my novel, what

00:11:34.520 --> 00:11:35.644
I learned from that helped.

00:11:35.644 --> 00:11:38.126
Like you see like life is
just one interconnected stream

00:11:38.126 --> 00:11:39.500
in which you are
kind of learning

00:11:39.500 --> 00:11:42.370
in very, very different
dimensions all the time.

00:11:42.370 --> 00:11:44.290
So that's one kind
of idea that happens.

00:11:44.290 --> 00:11:47.440
The second idea, there is
this beautiful human concept

00:11:47.440 --> 00:11:52.680
of dharma which means that
everything has a natural trust.

00:11:52.680 --> 00:11:55.500
Like the trust of the trees
to grow and bear fruit,

00:11:55.500 --> 00:11:57.480
it's not to flow like a river.

00:11:57.480 --> 00:11:58.730
That's the thrust of the tree.

00:11:58.730 --> 00:12:02.550
And every human has a certain
thrust, a certain tendency.

00:12:02.550 --> 00:12:04.640
And what happens is
that our-- call it

00:12:04.640 --> 00:12:09.750
that gut or the tendency gets
enveloped with a lot of-- greed

00:12:09.750 --> 00:12:12.110
is not the right word, but
it gets a little bit greed

00:12:12.110 --> 00:12:15.340
in the sense that you start
to put too many layers on what

00:12:15.340 --> 00:12:15.986
you need.

00:12:15.986 --> 00:12:17.860
And that's where you're
like, I can't do this

00:12:17.860 --> 00:12:20.020
because I need this
for my kids' education,

00:12:20.020 --> 00:12:20.980
my kids' college fund.

00:12:20.980 --> 00:12:23.180
You start putting all
these layers around you.

00:12:23.180 --> 00:12:24.550
With all of these
sabbaticals, what happens

00:12:24.550 --> 00:12:26.049
is then when you're
pushing yourself

00:12:26.049 --> 00:12:28.730
to physical discomfort, if
you spend nine months sleeping

00:12:28.730 --> 00:12:31.410
on the floor of an ashram,
guess what, when you come back,

00:12:31.410 --> 00:12:35.250
you're not like, what's the best
school district and the best

00:12:35.250 --> 00:12:36.170
house that I can buy.

00:12:36.170 --> 00:12:38.360
You're like, oh, I can
survive with nothing,

00:12:38.360 --> 00:12:40.280
so let me just come back
and do what's right.

00:12:40.280 --> 00:12:42.540
And I felt that my
choices have become

00:12:42.540 --> 00:12:45.280
extremely authentic,
and very true to what

00:12:45.280 --> 00:12:49.380
I want to do based on again
and again reminding myself

00:12:49.380 --> 00:12:50.800
that I need.

00:12:50.800 --> 00:12:53.624
My wife and I need very
little to go back on.

00:12:53.624 --> 00:12:55.290
That's the other thing
that I've started

00:12:55.290 --> 00:12:57.929
to see has led to much more
authentic decision making.

00:12:57.929 --> 00:12:59.720
And then the final
thing is this whole idea

00:12:59.720 --> 00:13:03.480
that you become very intuitive.

00:13:03.480 --> 00:13:05.550
Like for me, I'm an
engineer, business school,

00:13:05.550 --> 00:13:06.690
very left brained.

00:13:06.690 --> 00:13:09.980
My whole way of operating
things is analysis and models

00:13:09.980 --> 00:13:11.290
and thinking.

00:13:11.290 --> 00:13:15.090
And when you're on this kind of
a completely surrendered year.

00:13:15.090 --> 00:13:17.520
And so we'll talk a little
bit about going from Europe

00:13:17.520 --> 00:13:19.640
to India by road
without any plan at all.

00:13:19.640 --> 00:13:21.950
You just learn to become
very intuitive about how

00:13:21.950 --> 00:13:23.290
you make decisions.

00:13:23.290 --> 00:13:25.550
And I've seen again and
again once I come back,

00:13:25.550 --> 00:13:28.510
my decision making have left
that rational part of me

00:13:28.510 --> 00:13:29.010
behind.

00:13:29.010 --> 00:13:32.250
Or like I'd be very
comfortable making

00:13:32.250 --> 00:13:34.340
very big strategic
decisions on work

00:13:34.340 --> 00:13:36.066
based on just what
my heart is saying.

00:13:36.066 --> 00:13:37.690
And I'm not that kind
of person at all.

00:13:37.690 --> 00:13:40.930
So I've always seen your
intuitive side comes back

00:13:40.930 --> 00:13:45.220
when you're out on these
long trips of surrender.

00:13:45.220 --> 00:13:48.260
So these are things
that I feel have really

00:13:48.260 --> 00:13:52.360
given my career a deep three
dimensional angle that actually

00:13:52.360 --> 00:13:55.300
didn't exist before I
started doing these trips.

00:13:55.300 --> 00:13:59.040
So that's why I thought it would
be an interesting thing for you

00:13:59.040 --> 00:13:59.540
to consider.

00:13:59.540 --> 00:14:02.000
I'm going to wrap
up with this idea

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:05.150
that if you're thinking of doing
this, a couple of sample years

00:14:05.150 --> 00:14:07.706
that I created for you.

00:14:07.706 --> 00:14:09.892
This was the last
about sabbatical, which

00:14:09.892 --> 00:14:11.100
is very special in many ways.

00:14:11.100 --> 00:14:14.090
We went from Europe to India
by road for three months,

00:14:14.090 --> 00:14:17.510
in pretty harsh conditions
like sleeping on train

00:14:17.510 --> 00:14:18.570
stations and all of that.

00:14:18.570 --> 00:14:20.410
So very intuitively
deciding where

00:14:20.410 --> 00:14:22.840
to go when and how to do next.

00:14:22.840 --> 00:14:26.307
And then we spent six
months in an ashram in India

00:14:26.307 --> 00:14:27.390
doing yoga and meditation.

00:14:27.390 --> 00:14:30.100
And then we came back and
lived in an artist retreat

00:14:30.100 --> 00:14:31.270
in Portugal.

00:14:31.270 --> 00:14:33.360
All of this, surprisingly
enough, like it costs

00:14:33.360 --> 00:14:37.930
so less, because you are
in ashram in India-- I

00:14:37.930 --> 00:14:40.690
mean, you're talking
like $300 a month

00:14:40.690 --> 00:14:42.700
for two people sort of a thing.

00:14:42.700 --> 00:14:46.110
Your costs are so
low, and yet I guess

00:14:46.110 --> 00:14:48.820
your experiences are very,
very interesting and deep.

00:14:48.820 --> 00:14:51.320
The thing that I keep hearing
is that what if you have kids,

00:14:51.320 --> 00:14:52.520
you can't do it.

00:14:52.520 --> 00:14:55.000
You're going to do it in
a couple of years now.

00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:57.310
And what we've seen
is that with kids you

00:14:57.310 --> 00:14:59.210
just need a solid routine.

00:14:59.210 --> 00:15:01.560
And you can reconstruct
that routine anywhere.

00:15:01.560 --> 00:15:04.524
So again in the same
principle, what we've seen

00:15:04.524 --> 00:15:06.690
is people do, they spend
four months in an orphanage

00:15:06.690 --> 00:15:09.541
in Cambodia, spend four months
in Spain learning something,

00:15:09.541 --> 00:15:11.040
spent four months
in an [INAUDIBLE].

00:15:11.040 --> 00:15:12.950
You can just reconstruct
that routine anywhere.

00:15:12.950 --> 00:15:14.366
And we kind of
plan to do that now

00:15:14.366 --> 00:15:16.860
that we have two kids each time.

00:15:16.860 --> 00:15:18.980
So very possible
in every scenario.

00:15:18.980 --> 00:15:22.096
And you'll benefit a lot
I guess is the message.

00:15:22.096 --> 00:15:23.970
Very counterintuitively
you do benefit a lot.

00:15:23.970 --> 00:15:25.880
And we kind of
experience some models.

00:15:25.880 --> 00:15:30.050
And I'm kind of in this idea
now that the first time you

00:15:30.050 --> 00:15:32.821
take this leap of faith,
first it's very hard.

00:15:32.821 --> 00:15:34.570
Like the first time I
took it, I was like,

00:15:34.570 --> 00:15:37.330
will I be broke and
destitute for all my life?

00:15:37.330 --> 00:15:39.120
And I used to think
that, how did I

00:15:39.120 --> 00:15:41.950
become this American who was
taking a year to find himself?

00:15:41.950 --> 00:15:45.355
Like I was this guy
from India who--

00:15:45.355 --> 00:15:46.730
when we were
growing up in India,

00:15:46.730 --> 00:15:48.530
we would always
have this concept

00:15:48.530 --> 00:15:50.994
of this American backpacker
who took a year to find himself

00:15:50.994 --> 00:15:51.660
sort of a thing.

00:15:51.660 --> 00:15:54.710
And we'd be like, that's
not a life at all.

00:15:54.710 --> 00:15:57.786
We just have to get
a job and stay to it.

00:15:57.786 --> 00:15:59.160
When I took the
first sabbatical,

00:15:59.160 --> 00:16:01.800
I was just thinking
that this just isn't me.

00:16:01.800 --> 00:16:02.660
I was very nervous.

00:16:02.660 --> 00:16:04.951
I was like, I don't want to
be this American hippie who

00:16:04.951 --> 00:16:05.910
was finding himself.

00:16:05.910 --> 00:16:09.570
And I was always kind
of thinking about that.

00:16:09.570 --> 00:16:13.904
Anyway, the point being that
it's possible for everyone.

00:16:13.904 --> 00:16:16.070
And then when I came back
from the first sabbatical,

00:16:16.070 --> 00:16:18.110
it's like you're a little
bit in the crossroads.

00:16:18.110 --> 00:16:20.790
You don't come back with
this great sense of centered.

00:16:20.790 --> 00:16:23.290
I came back with being like
oh, I love this novel thing.

00:16:23.290 --> 00:16:24.280
I love my career thing.

00:16:24.280 --> 00:16:25.340
I love this yoga stuff.

00:16:25.340 --> 00:16:26.889
What should I do?

00:16:26.889 --> 00:16:27.680
And I've seen that.

00:16:27.680 --> 00:16:29.596
What I've seen with my
progressive sabbaticals

00:16:29.596 --> 00:16:32.850
is that I have no longer left--
like that conflict has just

00:16:32.850 --> 00:16:34.422
gone away.

00:16:34.422 --> 00:16:36.880
You just start to view life as
just this one interconnected

00:16:36.880 --> 00:16:37.380
stream.

00:16:37.380 --> 00:16:39.996
I'm going to take up a job
now, going to give it my best.

00:16:39.996 --> 00:16:41.370
And then after a
couple of years,

00:16:41.370 --> 00:16:43.442
I might take time-- if
that feeling arises,

00:16:43.442 --> 00:16:44.900
I'm going to take
the time to write

00:16:44.900 --> 00:16:47.170
and I'm going to write
the next novel or whatever

00:16:47.170 --> 00:16:48.680
and do something.

00:16:48.680 --> 00:16:51.120
And then once that's done,
I'm going to look for a job.

00:16:51.120 --> 00:16:54.650
You just start to feel like life
is just one continuous stream

00:16:54.650 --> 00:16:55.884
of growth and learning.

00:16:55.884 --> 00:16:57.300
And it doesn't
really matter which

00:16:57.300 --> 00:16:58.930
vector you're learning
from, all of it

00:16:58.930 --> 00:17:01.920
is making you wider
and broader and deeper.

00:17:01.920 --> 00:17:02.860
And that's fine.

00:17:02.860 --> 00:17:06.665
And I think that's kind
of like a beautiful thing.

00:17:06.665 --> 00:17:08.470
It just gives you a
lot of flow with life

00:17:08.470 --> 00:17:10.440
without hanging on
to that you need

00:17:10.440 --> 00:17:13.660
this thing to grow
this particular job,

00:17:13.660 --> 00:17:14.869
this particular role.

00:17:14.869 --> 00:17:16.960
And I've seen that
start to happen a lot,

00:17:16.960 --> 00:17:21.250
that everything feels like
one interconnected stream.

00:17:21.250 --> 00:17:24.894
So I guess that's
the conclusion of it.

00:17:24.894 --> 00:17:27.060
I wanted to end with something
very different, which

00:17:27.060 --> 00:17:30.910
is whenever I'm nowadays
making tough decisions,

00:17:30.910 --> 00:17:35.590
I borrow a lot from
storytelling-- this whole idea

00:17:35.590 --> 00:17:40.910
in a good story, the hero always
leaves the known world behind

00:17:40.910 --> 00:17:42.452
to enter an unknown world.

00:17:42.452 --> 00:17:44.160
So think of "The
Alchemist," "Moby Dick."

00:17:44.160 --> 00:17:45.910
Any good story you'll
always have the hero

00:17:45.910 --> 00:17:50.330
leave the known world behind,
enter the unknown world,

00:17:50.330 --> 00:17:52.450
choosing this very
lofty, unattainable goal

00:17:52.450 --> 00:17:54.359
which can't be articulated
almost sometimes.

00:17:54.359 --> 00:17:55.900
Or it can be
articulated, but there's

00:17:55.900 --> 00:17:58.040
chasing somebody, lofty
unattainable goal.

00:17:58.040 --> 00:18:01.160
And even if they
slip and stumble,

00:18:01.160 --> 00:18:03.450
you always think that the
story's really successful

00:18:03.450 --> 00:18:06.030
because the character has
transformed in the process.

00:18:06.030 --> 00:18:07.130
So if I think of
all my novels, they

00:18:07.130 --> 00:18:08.671
follow the same
construct of the hero

00:18:08.671 --> 00:18:10.980
has left the known world,
gone into the unknown world,

00:18:10.980 --> 00:18:12.440
faced conflict after conflict.

00:18:12.440 --> 00:18:14.300
It makes the story
really interesting.

00:18:14.300 --> 00:18:15.230
And then I started
to play around

00:18:15.230 --> 00:18:16.430
with like life is like that.

00:18:16.430 --> 00:18:18.585
If you are leaving the
known world behind and going

00:18:18.585 --> 00:18:20.960
into the unknown world, there
is no guarantee of success.

00:18:20.960 --> 00:18:24.310
Most likely you will face that
death, rebirth kind of moment

00:18:24.310 --> 00:18:27.400
in which all is lost.

00:18:27.400 --> 00:18:29.120
But it's a damn
interesting story.

00:18:29.120 --> 00:18:31.135
So I think life is a
little bit like that.

00:18:31.135 --> 00:18:33.995
Leave the known world behind
and hopefully it will come out.

00:18:33.995 --> 00:18:35.870
And if it doesn't, it's
a great story anyway.

00:18:35.870 --> 00:18:37.590
So with that, thank you.

00:18:37.590 --> 00:18:47.150
[APPLAUSE]

00:18:47.150 --> 00:18:48.650
SACHIT EGAN: Thanks
for that, Karan.

00:18:48.650 --> 00:18:49.200
KARAN BAJAJ: Thank you.

00:18:49.200 --> 00:18:50.658
SACHIT EGAN: Let's
begin with this.

00:18:50.658 --> 00:18:53.080
You've said you do so
much work with encouraging

00:18:53.080 --> 00:18:54.930
aspiring authors to get started.

00:18:54.930 --> 00:18:57.460
You've said that writing a
book is almost like life.

00:18:57.460 --> 00:18:59.570
Why is that?

00:18:59.570 --> 00:19:02.290
KARAN BAJAJ: Writing
a book is like life--

00:19:02.290 --> 00:19:05.680
so I think every book
that I at least write

00:19:05.680 --> 00:19:09.850
is constructed on two pillars,
entertainment and meaning.

00:19:09.850 --> 00:19:12.720
And if I crack those two,
then I know that I've

00:19:12.720 --> 00:19:13.750
cracked a great story.

00:19:13.750 --> 00:19:16.457
If I'm very clear on, if
I'm able to articulate what

00:19:16.457 --> 00:19:19.040
is that meaning in this novel--
so in this novel, for example,

00:19:19.040 --> 00:19:22.821
the meaning comes from what
is enlightenment, what is

00:19:22.821 --> 00:19:24.070
the nature of human suffering.

00:19:24.070 --> 00:19:26.067
Those are the meaning questions.

00:19:26.067 --> 00:19:27.650
But if I write only
meaning, then I'll

00:19:27.650 --> 00:19:30.170
write some PhD thesis
on the nature of life

00:19:30.170 --> 00:19:31.300
that nobody wants to write.

00:19:31.300 --> 00:19:34.632
Then I balance it out with,
what is the entertainment here.

00:19:34.632 --> 00:19:36.340
And the entertainment
for me in this book

00:19:36.340 --> 00:19:38.170
was that every
inner question has

00:19:38.170 --> 00:19:42.230
to be reflected in a
dramatic external journey.

00:19:42.230 --> 00:19:45.010
So going from these surreal
night markets to hidden ashrams

00:19:45.010 --> 00:19:46.500
to caves high in the Himalayas.

00:19:46.500 --> 00:19:48.439
It's a very page
turning adventure.

00:19:48.439 --> 00:19:49.980
And if I crack those
two, then I know

00:19:49.980 --> 00:19:52.830
that I've got a novel
that I can construct.

00:19:52.830 --> 00:19:56.880
So in a sense I feel like life
is a little bit like that.

00:19:56.880 --> 00:19:58.635
It's a constant
quest for meaning.

00:20:01.200 --> 00:20:04.200
The way to answer that quest for
meaning is not to be cerebral,

00:20:04.200 --> 00:20:06.650
but to thrust yourself
into the action.

00:20:06.650 --> 00:20:09.230
And my guess is that combination
of entertainment and meaning

00:20:09.230 --> 00:20:11.320
makes for a good
story and a good life.

00:20:11.320 --> 00:20:14.390
If you stand on only one
foundation, it wobbles.

00:20:14.390 --> 00:20:16.862
The story wobbles,
and life wobbles

00:20:16.862 --> 00:20:18.820
if you're asking too many
meaningful questions,

00:20:18.820 --> 00:20:20.680
not doing enough to act on that.

00:20:20.680 --> 00:20:21.310
So yes.

00:20:21.310 --> 00:20:22.226
SACHIT EGAN: For sure.

00:20:22.226 --> 00:20:24.100
And I've seen online,
you give authors--

00:20:24.100 --> 00:20:25.800
aspiring authors--
ideas about how

00:20:25.800 --> 00:20:28.434
to find the entertainment and
the meaning in their stories.

00:20:28.434 --> 00:20:30.350
Can you talk a little
bit about how you advise

00:20:30.350 --> 00:20:31.150
authors to go about that?

00:20:31.150 --> 00:20:32.480
KARAN BAJAJ: Oh, great question.

00:20:32.480 --> 00:20:33.563
Thank you for asking that.

00:20:33.563 --> 00:20:38.670
So for entertainment, I always
say, think of a secret world

00:20:38.670 --> 00:20:42.910
that you have some access to
or a deep interest that nobody

00:20:42.910 --> 00:20:43.510
has access to.

00:20:43.510 --> 00:20:46.010
Like you guys are in a perfect
place right now, right?

00:20:46.010 --> 00:20:48.857
Silicon Valley's
so much in culture.

00:20:48.857 --> 00:20:51.190
It's not a secret world for
you, but it's a secret world

00:20:51.190 --> 00:20:53.560
for the rest of the world.

00:20:53.560 --> 00:20:55.430
If you're constructing
a story based

00:20:55.430 --> 00:20:58.020
on the inner workings of
a secret society-- which

00:20:58.020 --> 00:21:00.900
in this case is Google,
Silicon Valley-- that's

00:21:00.900 --> 00:21:02.576
very interesting.

00:21:02.576 --> 00:21:03.950
That's really good
entertainment.

00:21:03.950 --> 00:21:06.150
So the secret world is
my kind of like theory

00:21:06.150 --> 00:21:06.900
for entertainment.

00:21:06.900 --> 00:21:07.649
It's hard to pick.

00:21:07.649 --> 00:21:09.660
Like in this story for
example, the secret world

00:21:09.660 --> 00:21:11.660
is like these hidden
ashrams in India

00:21:11.660 --> 00:21:14.370
that at least is interesting
to a subsection of society.

00:21:14.370 --> 00:21:16.320
So that's my
entertainment philosophy.

00:21:16.320 --> 00:21:20.320
And then meaning of all this
is, what is the deepest question

00:21:20.320 --> 00:21:22.845
that you've struggled with.

00:21:22.845 --> 00:21:24.470
It could be the death
of a relationship

00:21:24.470 --> 00:21:27.600
or it could be finding meaning.

00:21:27.600 --> 00:21:29.610
What is the deepest,
most personal question

00:21:29.610 --> 00:21:31.222
you're struggling with?

00:21:31.222 --> 00:21:33.180
For the most part, if
you kind of explore that,

00:21:33.180 --> 00:21:35.305
you will find a lot of
connect with a lot of people

00:21:35.305 --> 00:21:37.670
because the human condition
is very, very similar.

00:21:37.670 --> 00:21:40.120
SACHIT EGAN: Fair enough.

00:21:40.120 --> 00:21:41.890
Something else on this point.

00:21:41.890 --> 00:21:44.840
You mentioned you said
live an interesting life.

00:21:44.840 --> 00:21:46.640
This is a way you
collect experiences.

00:21:46.640 --> 00:21:48.210
You were just
talking about this.

00:21:48.210 --> 00:21:49.460
Push yourself.

00:21:49.460 --> 00:21:50.820
Go out into the world.

00:21:50.820 --> 00:21:52.480
Make things difficult.
Mix things up.

00:21:52.480 --> 00:21:54.188
It gives you these
collective experiences

00:21:54.188 --> 00:21:56.700
that you can then use
to tell this narrative.

00:21:56.700 --> 00:22:00.320
At the same time, you also
mentioned at some point in life

00:22:00.320 --> 00:22:03.150
you don't need the 15th
cathedral in Germany,

00:22:03.150 --> 00:22:05.560
that experience has almost
become a little cheaper.

00:22:05.560 --> 00:22:07.450
Can you talk about
that conflict?

00:22:07.450 --> 00:22:09.250
KARAN BAJAJ: Yeah, absolutely.

00:22:09.250 --> 00:22:11.140
So in the "Yoga
Sutras of Patanjali,"

00:22:11.140 --> 00:22:14.135
which is like a Bible
of yoga in a way,

00:22:14.135 --> 00:22:16.610
there's this beautiful idea
that life is a little bit

00:22:16.610 --> 00:22:20.590
like the journey of-- it's
like the flight of an eagle.

00:22:20.590 --> 00:22:26.970
So an eagle spreads its wings
high and enjoys flight fully.

00:22:26.970 --> 00:22:30.210
Grows, enjoys-- and
kind of the human life

00:22:30.210 --> 00:22:32.940
is like that, that there is
a time in which you spread

00:22:32.940 --> 00:22:35.980
your wings unboundedly and
experience everything that you

00:22:35.980 --> 00:22:37.016
can in flight.

00:22:37.016 --> 00:22:38.390
But then to complete
the journey,

00:22:38.390 --> 00:22:40.951
you have to kind of bring
the wings down and complete

00:22:40.951 --> 00:22:41.450
the journey.

00:22:41.450 --> 00:22:45.596
I feel a little bit like life
is over a series of lifetimes,

00:22:45.596 --> 00:22:47.470
if you believe in that,
or even in this life,

00:22:47.470 --> 00:22:49.120
it's a little bit
like you have a period

00:22:49.120 --> 00:22:50.369
in which you are experiencing.

00:22:50.369 --> 00:22:53.094
And then you'll reach a
little bit of a disenchantment

00:22:53.094 --> 00:22:54.260
with the world, if you will.

00:22:54.260 --> 00:22:59.170
And then you have to go inner
to complete the journey almost.

00:22:59.170 --> 00:23:01.370
SACHIT EGAN: Are
those periods, I

00:23:01.370 --> 00:23:04.310
guess, where your reach
that disenchantment,

00:23:04.310 --> 00:23:07.137
are those the hiccups on that
trajectory that you talk about?

00:23:07.137 --> 00:23:09.220
Are they a necessary part
of the creative process?

00:23:09.220 --> 00:23:09.960
KARAN BAJAJ: Yeah, I think so.

00:23:09.960 --> 00:23:11.600
Because I think for me
at least, what happened

00:23:11.600 --> 00:23:13.433
was that when I was
doing these sabbaticals,

00:23:13.433 --> 00:23:14.796
the first one was very external.

00:23:14.796 --> 00:23:16.420
Like I was traveling
to all the spaces.

00:23:16.420 --> 00:23:17.870
The second one
was also external,

00:23:17.870 --> 00:23:20.762
and I started to feel
like a bit of emptiness

00:23:20.762 --> 00:23:22.220
through that whole
process of like,

00:23:22.220 --> 00:23:26.536
I really don't want to
see the Colosseum in Rome.

00:23:26.536 --> 00:23:27.910
It's just not
interesting at all.

00:23:27.910 --> 00:23:30.500
I don't want to
see this cathedral.

00:23:30.500 --> 00:23:33.345
And I think there's a little
bit of this bump period.

00:23:33.345 --> 00:23:34.970
And then that's why
the last sabbatical

00:23:34.970 --> 00:23:37.880
has been so internal,
like six months in one

00:23:37.880 --> 00:23:40.050
small little ashram in
the middle of nowhere,

00:23:40.050 --> 00:23:41.390
and then an [INAUDIBLE].

00:23:41.390 --> 00:23:43.650
It was very internal.

00:23:43.650 --> 00:23:45.050
Plus it's happened like that.

00:23:45.050 --> 00:23:47.754
SACHIT EGAN: I'm wondering, I
find this analogy of the eagle

00:23:47.754 --> 00:23:49.670
spreading its wings and
then coming to a place

00:23:49.670 --> 00:23:52.130
where it starts to close,
I find it very relevant.

00:23:52.130 --> 00:23:55.691
But perhaps to folks who may
not have a similar experience

00:23:55.691 --> 00:23:58.190
of what it's like to close those
wings of feel that calling,

00:23:58.190 --> 00:24:00.450
how would you
quantify that moment,

00:24:00.450 --> 00:24:02.999
or could you describe that?

00:24:02.999 --> 00:24:04.540
KARAN BAJAJ: I think
you know, right?

00:24:04.540 --> 00:24:07.340
Like you feel a little
bit of the disenchantment

00:24:07.340 --> 00:24:09.140
with your setup, as you will.

00:24:09.140 --> 00:24:10.870
I think all the
physical signs start

00:24:10.870 --> 00:24:14.240
to feel that you-- for
me, those physical signs

00:24:14.240 --> 00:24:16.510
were very intense.

00:24:16.510 --> 00:24:17.700
I wouldn't enjoy traveling.

00:24:17.700 --> 00:24:19.325
I would be with
friends and then people

00:24:19.325 --> 00:24:22.080
would talk about, I don't
know, like this dinner

00:24:22.080 --> 00:24:22.990
and that restaurant.

00:24:22.990 --> 00:24:26.510
And it just felt very empty.

00:24:26.510 --> 00:24:28.890
I felt very disconnected
with the world around me.

00:24:28.890 --> 00:24:32.370
And I knew that there was
some stronger, inner calling.

00:24:32.370 --> 00:24:33.950
That's the first
thing that prompted

00:24:33.950 --> 00:24:36.170
me to get really serious
about my meditation and all

00:24:36.170 --> 00:24:37.869
that stuff.

00:24:37.869 --> 00:24:39.660
SACHIT EGAN: Let's talk
about dharma again.

00:24:39.660 --> 00:24:40.701
It's a beautiful concept.

00:24:43.190 --> 00:24:44.739
Can you elaborate
on dharma and how

00:24:44.739 --> 00:24:47.030
it might apply to Googlers
or people in Silicon Valley?

00:24:47.030 --> 00:24:48.990
KARAN BAJAJ: Yeah, absolutely.

00:24:48.990 --> 00:24:52.280
So the idea of dharma
really is that, like I said,

00:24:52.280 --> 00:24:53.410
every being has a thrust.

00:24:53.410 --> 00:24:55.810
Like the trees [INAUDIBLE]
to grow and bear fruit.

00:24:55.810 --> 00:25:00.760
And the same way, you as a human
have a little bit of a thrust.

00:25:00.760 --> 00:25:04.740
Like you might be pulled
more towards business,

00:25:04.740 --> 00:25:06.350
and that's kind of your thrust.

00:25:06.350 --> 00:25:09.800
And then even if you start doing
yoga and meditation and all

00:25:09.800 --> 00:25:12.210
that stuff, that
doesn't go away.

00:25:12.210 --> 00:25:13.880
And it's just like
what they say,

00:25:13.880 --> 00:25:15.940
before enlightenment,
chop wood, carry water.

00:25:15.940 --> 00:25:18.036
After enlightenment,
chop wood, carry water.

00:25:18.036 --> 00:25:19.410
So it's really
the dharma doesn't

00:25:19.410 --> 00:25:22.446
change, your way of acting
in that environment changes.

00:25:22.446 --> 00:25:24.070
And I think what I've
seen in the US is

00:25:24.070 --> 00:25:27.050
that people want
to go from point A

00:25:27.050 --> 00:25:30.190
to point B very quickly.

00:25:30.190 --> 00:25:32.770
They are like lawyers, they
go to a few yoga classes,

00:25:32.770 --> 00:25:34.660
and then they want to
become yoga teachers.

00:25:34.660 --> 00:25:37.020
The concept of dharma would
be that if you are a lawyer

00:25:37.020 --> 00:25:39.944
and you are thriving
in it, don't

00:25:39.944 --> 00:25:42.110
wear the robes of the monk
before you become a monk.

00:25:42.110 --> 00:25:44.650
Like kind of keep
wearing your robes

00:25:44.650 --> 00:25:47.470
and do it in a purified
way, the action.

00:25:47.470 --> 00:25:49.247
That's more in line
with the thrust,

00:25:49.247 --> 00:25:50.580
and that's what the world needs.

00:25:50.580 --> 00:25:54.447
And that's what you will
act in accordance with.

00:25:54.447 --> 00:25:55.280
So that's beautiful.

00:25:55.280 --> 00:25:57.654
So if your thrust is to be an
engineer, that's beautiful.

00:25:57.654 --> 00:25:59.660
Go take all this time
off and come back,

00:25:59.660 --> 00:26:00.530
and you'll still be an engineer.

00:26:00.530 --> 00:26:02.660
You won't become a yoga
teacher at the end of it.

00:26:02.660 --> 00:26:04.530
You will just be
a more, I guess,

00:26:04.530 --> 00:26:06.660
silent engineer, more
silent in your mind

00:26:06.660 --> 00:26:08.290
while still doing
the same activity.

00:26:08.290 --> 00:26:09.206
SACHIT EGAN: For sure.

00:26:09.206 --> 00:26:12.390
I think it's worth mentioning at
this point is one way the book,

00:26:12.390 --> 00:26:14.390
"The Yoga of Max's
Discontent," or "The Seeker,"

00:26:14.390 --> 00:26:16.880
has been described as a
modern day "Siddhartha."

00:26:16.880 --> 00:26:18.390
And probably many
in the room knows

00:26:18.390 --> 00:26:21.980
"Siddhartha" by Hermann Hesse
is just a very foundational

00:26:21.980 --> 00:26:24.510
spiritual novel for the West.

00:26:24.510 --> 00:26:27.320
And it's that
comparison that actually

00:26:27.320 --> 00:26:29.910
convinced me to read the book.

00:26:29.910 --> 00:26:31.890
"Siddhartha," not
to give anything

00:26:31.890 --> 00:26:33.640
away-- spoiler
alert-- it kind of

00:26:33.640 --> 00:26:35.250
describes life as being stages.

00:26:35.250 --> 00:26:37.744
That you might begin
chop wood, carry water,

00:26:37.744 --> 00:26:39.410
but then tomorrow
you're a business man.

00:26:39.410 --> 00:26:41.690
And then tomorrow you're
a yogi, an ascetic living

00:26:41.690 --> 00:26:44.840
somewhere else--
big, drastic changes

00:26:44.840 --> 00:26:46.360
over the course of a life.

00:26:46.360 --> 00:26:49.341
And I guess your vision with
dharma is a little different.

00:26:49.341 --> 00:26:50.840
KARAN BAJAJ: A
little bit, because I

00:26:50.840 --> 00:26:53.420
think "Siddhartha" is also
a little bit of a metaphor

00:26:53.420 --> 00:26:55.040
for multiple lives.

00:26:55.040 --> 00:26:58.810
And obviously since multiple
lives is a very metaphysical

00:26:58.810 --> 00:27:01.177
concept, that can take
away from storytelling,

00:27:01.177 --> 00:27:03.010
because people have to
believe in something.

00:27:03.010 --> 00:27:04.520
So obviously he
kind of charts out

00:27:04.520 --> 00:27:07.990
the whole of human
life in one book.

00:27:07.990 --> 00:27:11.370
I think dharma would say that
there is gradual movement.

00:27:11.370 --> 00:27:13.200
So you know, if
you're an engineer

00:27:13.200 --> 00:27:16.350
and you go into
the spiritual life,

00:27:16.350 --> 00:27:18.660
you will still be an
engineer with a silent mind.

00:27:18.660 --> 00:27:21.830
And then slowly, maybe
slowly, slowly, slowly, you

00:27:21.830 --> 00:27:25.510
will become the
meditation like teacher.

00:27:25.510 --> 00:27:29.250
But you don't have to like--
life is a slow unfolding

00:27:29.250 --> 00:27:30.210
and not as dramatic.

00:27:30.210 --> 00:27:32.830
I have to go from
becoming this to-- it's

00:27:32.830 --> 00:27:35.030
not always a
journey of becoming.

00:27:35.030 --> 00:27:36.490
It's a slow journey
of unfolding.

00:27:36.490 --> 00:27:38.448
SACHIT EGAN: Something
that I was curious about

00:27:38.448 --> 00:27:40.600
is the main character in
your latest book is Max.

00:27:40.600 --> 00:27:43.500
And Max starts in New
York, and he goes to India,

00:27:43.500 --> 00:27:45.180
ends up in India, Himalayas.

00:27:45.180 --> 00:27:47.210
You started Himalayas,
go to New York,

00:27:47.210 --> 00:27:49.750
go to Himalayas, but then
now back to New York.

00:27:49.750 --> 00:27:50.561
Why the difference?

00:27:50.561 --> 00:27:52.560
It seems like you and Max
have a different path.

00:27:52.560 --> 00:27:55.680
KARAN BAJAJ: Yeah, and it
really happened, little bit

00:27:55.680 --> 00:28:01.520
almost consciously that in
this particular book also,

00:28:01.520 --> 00:28:04.800
I really wanted to eliminate all
sense of authorship completely.

00:28:04.800 --> 00:28:07.640
I really wanted the story
to take on its own--

00:28:07.640 --> 00:28:09.724
when you read the book,
I just wanted the person

00:28:09.724 --> 00:28:11.890
to be transported into
effective dream in which they

00:28:11.890 --> 00:28:14.420
can sense no presence
of an author at all.

00:28:14.420 --> 00:28:16.630
And really kind of his
journey became his own

00:28:16.630 --> 00:28:20.470
and became more and more
leave the world behind.

00:28:20.470 --> 00:28:22.540
And my journey is not that.

00:28:22.540 --> 00:28:23.590
SACHIT EGAN: Sure, OK.

00:28:23.590 --> 00:28:25.980
Could you maybe
talk a little bit

00:28:25.980 --> 00:28:28.920
about how when you realized
that that journey was different,

00:28:28.920 --> 00:28:32.090
that the people who were at this
ashram, some of them wanted,

00:28:32.090 --> 00:28:33.660
I guess, enlightenment
in this life,

00:28:33.660 --> 00:28:35.700
and you decided that's a
different path for you?

00:28:35.700 --> 00:28:36.470
KARAN BAJAJ: Yeah.

00:28:36.470 --> 00:28:39.550
So when I was living in
this ashram for six months,

00:28:39.550 --> 00:28:42.754
during the time that I
left, I felt this time

00:28:42.754 --> 00:28:45.170
that there's a very strong
likelihood that my girlfriend--

00:28:45.170 --> 00:28:45.992
who is my wife now.

00:28:45.992 --> 00:28:47.700
At that point I talked
to her about that,

00:28:47.700 --> 00:28:52.970
that there's a strong likelihood
that I might never come back.

00:28:52.970 --> 00:28:55.610
I grew up in the Indian
tradition in which

00:28:55.610 --> 00:28:57.170
people became ascetics.

00:28:57.170 --> 00:29:00.640
And it was kind of like you
did watch lawyers, doctors,

00:29:00.640 --> 00:29:02.880
engineers become ascetics
up in the Himalayas,

00:29:02.880 --> 00:29:04.990
become these cave
dwelling yogis.

00:29:04.990 --> 00:29:07.620
And I was feeling
that I would become--

00:29:07.620 --> 00:29:09.620
I was comfortable with
this idea that at the end

00:29:09.620 --> 00:29:10.995
of this sabbatical,
I would never

00:29:10.995 --> 00:29:15.000
want to come back and become
a cave dweller in some form.

00:29:15.000 --> 00:29:18.606
And during the course
of living in the ashram,

00:29:18.606 --> 00:29:20.670
this idea of dharma
became very clear to me

00:29:20.670 --> 00:29:23.040
because I was not in my element.

00:29:23.040 --> 00:29:24.630
I was in the ashram.

00:29:24.630 --> 00:29:25.820
I was enjoying myself.

00:29:25.820 --> 00:29:27.695
I could see how I
was transforming.

00:29:27.695 --> 00:29:29.820
I was deepening in my yoga
and meditation practice.

00:29:29.820 --> 00:29:32.895
But I always knew that I
was kind of out of sorts.

00:29:32.895 --> 00:29:34.520
And on the other
hand, I started to see

00:29:34.520 --> 00:29:37.300
people who were out of
sorts before in their world

00:29:37.300 --> 00:29:41.620
becoming completely in line,
in rhythm in the ashram.

00:29:41.620 --> 00:29:43.620
It was very interesting
to see that I felt out

00:29:43.620 --> 00:29:48.120
of sorts despite learning
a lot, and people suddenly

00:29:48.120 --> 00:29:49.880
felt that they were
completely in rhythm

00:29:49.880 --> 00:29:52.090
and this is what they
were meant to be.

00:29:52.090 --> 00:29:56.320
And there are so many people who
just lived in ashram forever.

00:29:56.320 --> 00:29:58.901
And I just knew that it
was just not my thrust.

00:29:58.901 --> 00:29:59.650
SACHIT EGAN: Sure.

00:29:59.650 --> 00:30:00.750
Thanks for sharing that.

00:30:00.750 --> 00:30:02.710
Something I find interesting
about the message

00:30:02.710 --> 00:30:05.510
that you share now
is it seems like you

00:30:05.510 --> 00:30:08.150
postulate that you can't
have it all, at some levels.

00:30:08.150 --> 00:30:12.430
What I mean by that is, a lot
of self-help books or even

00:30:12.430 --> 00:30:15.410
spiritual books,
they suggest that you

00:30:15.410 --> 00:30:18.840
don't have to pick between
spirituality and your thrust

00:30:18.840 --> 00:30:20.596
and the material world.

00:30:20.596 --> 00:30:21.970
That if you take
that sabbatical,

00:30:21.970 --> 00:30:24.660
you take that year every
three to four years,

00:30:24.660 --> 00:30:27.720
you not only become a better
yogi, a better author, you also

00:30:27.720 --> 00:30:29.895
become a better
business, a better CEO.

00:30:29.895 --> 00:30:31.520
And I've always been
skeptical of that.

00:30:31.520 --> 00:30:34.220
It feels like you kind of have
to pick what your life is about

00:30:34.220 --> 00:30:36.190
and forget about
the consequences.

00:30:36.190 --> 00:30:38.270
But you think you
could have both?

00:30:38.270 --> 00:30:39.147
KARAN BAJAJ: Yeah.

00:30:39.147 --> 00:30:40.230
I think you can have both.

00:30:40.230 --> 00:30:45.415
But I think it's fine if
you slip down one path.

00:30:45.415 --> 00:30:46.790
I think the biggest
difference is

00:30:46.790 --> 00:30:50.500
that I think the Western
culture is all about becoming.

00:30:50.500 --> 00:30:53.820
Go from point A to point B. Go
from lawyer to yoga teacher,

00:30:53.820 --> 00:30:55.836
from business profession
to self-help coach.

00:30:55.836 --> 00:30:56.960
People are always becoming.

00:30:56.960 --> 00:31:00.980
And I guess my model is
more like, it has to unfold.

00:31:00.980 --> 00:31:02.320
Let it unpeel and unfold.

00:31:02.320 --> 00:31:03.920
Let me just keep
purifying where I am.

00:31:03.920 --> 00:31:06.530
And slowly and
slowly and slowly--

00:31:06.530 --> 00:31:10.940
For example, in this classic
example of my own career,

00:31:10.940 --> 00:31:13.570
when I was at Procter &amp;
Gamble, I was very linear.

00:31:13.570 --> 00:31:15.800
I was working in my
brand management job.

00:31:15.800 --> 00:31:18.470
If I think of in the
last five, seven years,

00:31:18.470 --> 00:31:21.580
as my art has deepened, as
I've really become serious

00:31:21.580 --> 00:31:23.960
about writing and
become more and more,

00:31:23.960 --> 00:31:27.817
at least in my opinion,
more purer to the art form,

00:31:27.817 --> 00:31:28.900
my career has transformed.

00:31:28.900 --> 00:31:31.410
Now I'm running a
media company in India,

00:31:31.410 --> 00:31:34.830
which is like a perfect balance
of business and creativity.

00:31:34.830 --> 00:31:38.230
My whole job there is
to commission shows.

00:31:38.230 --> 00:31:39.984
And that requires me
to be very intuitive

00:31:39.984 --> 00:31:41.400
and [INAUDIBLE]
oriented on what's

00:31:41.400 --> 00:31:43.870
going to be in zeitgeist.

00:31:43.870 --> 00:31:45.291
In P&amp;G, that's not your job.

00:31:45.291 --> 00:31:47.540
And then BCG, definitely it
was a very analytical job.

00:31:47.540 --> 00:31:51.380
So what I've seen is that life
slowly unpeels and unfolds,

00:31:51.380 --> 00:31:53.960
versus me there being like OK,
I'm going to quit everything

00:31:53.960 --> 00:31:56.020
and I'm going to
become [INAUDIBLE].

00:31:56.020 --> 00:31:57.290
And I wasn't ready yet.

00:31:57.290 --> 00:31:59.338
So I think slow unfolding.

00:31:59.338 --> 00:32:00.296
SACHIT EGAN: Thank you.

00:32:00.296 --> 00:32:02.369
To pivot, something
that we're fortunate

00:32:02.369 --> 00:32:04.160
here as Googlers to
have is we occasionally

00:32:04.160 --> 00:32:06.076
have authors like yourself
who come in and are

00:32:06.076 --> 00:32:08.614
very encouraging of
other aspiring authors.

00:32:08.614 --> 00:32:11.030
A few weeks ago we had Anna
Quindlen actually sitting here

00:32:11.030 --> 00:32:12.397
in this chair in this room.

00:32:12.397 --> 00:32:14.730
And one of the questions that
was posed from an audience

00:32:14.730 --> 00:32:17.600
member was, this Googler,
she wanted to be an author.

00:32:17.600 --> 00:32:19.530
And she took two years
off, somehow managed

00:32:19.530 --> 00:32:21.604
to get a sabbatical,
rented a cabin,

00:32:21.604 --> 00:32:23.270
wanted to do the
Walden thing and really

00:32:23.270 --> 00:32:25.010
kind of focus on the writing.

00:32:25.010 --> 00:32:27.240
And it didn't work out.

00:32:27.240 --> 00:32:28.920
She mentioned that
she got distracted

00:32:28.920 --> 00:32:30.840
and it was very hard
to just kind of dive

00:32:30.840 --> 00:32:34.360
into the creative process
sort of on demand.

00:32:34.360 --> 00:32:37.230
And yet you'll jump for six
months here, take a year there,

00:32:37.230 --> 00:32:39.050
and you find that
it's easy to commit

00:32:39.050 --> 00:32:42.187
to a certain number
of words per day.

00:32:42.187 --> 00:32:43.020
Can you talk about--

00:32:43.020 --> 00:32:45.186
KARAN BAJAJ: Yeah, I think
the biggest difference is

00:32:45.186 --> 00:32:49.007
that because my
vision is not to make

00:32:49.007 --> 00:32:51.340
money from my writing, become
a full-time writer-- if it

00:32:51.340 --> 00:32:53.230
happens, great, but
that's not my vision

00:32:53.230 --> 00:32:58.787
I guess-- I am writing only
when I can't help but write.

00:32:58.787 --> 00:33:00.370
So it's almost like
I am treating life

00:33:00.370 --> 00:33:03.740
as a ground to gain experience.

00:33:03.740 --> 00:33:07.890
And then when the well fills
up and reaches a point where

00:33:07.890 --> 00:33:09.750
I just can't help but write--

00:33:09.750 --> 00:33:12.750
And so for example,
on this third novel,

00:33:12.750 --> 00:33:17.620
I quit my job six weeks before
my second baby was born.

00:33:17.620 --> 00:33:20.869
And it was the most
irrational thing, right?

00:33:20.869 --> 00:33:23.410
Why can't you wait six weeks
and get your company's insurance

00:33:23.410 --> 00:33:25.010
to have your kid being born?

00:33:25.010 --> 00:33:28.250
It's silly to
self-destruct like that.

00:33:28.250 --> 00:33:30.510
But I reach a point
where I'm like,

00:33:30.510 --> 00:33:34.230
I can't help but
start writing today.

00:33:34.230 --> 00:33:37.809
And I just wait for
that point to happen.

00:33:37.809 --> 00:33:39.100
And now that's what I'm seeing.

00:33:39.100 --> 00:33:40.558
The beautiful thing
now is that I'm

00:33:40.558 --> 00:33:43.550
starting to see that
it's all one stream view.

00:33:43.550 --> 00:33:45.560
In a way like it's OK
if I have to quit a job

00:33:45.560 --> 00:33:47.437
six weeks before my
baby's born, because I

00:33:47.437 --> 00:33:49.520
want to write because I'm
going to learn something

00:33:49.520 --> 00:33:50.030
through that writing.

00:33:50.030 --> 00:33:52.030
And then I'll come back
and find some other job.

00:33:52.030 --> 00:33:54.620
It will all work out eventually.

00:33:54.620 --> 00:33:57.920
But I think the difference is
that when people want to write,

00:33:57.920 --> 00:34:00.340
when they go to write, I
don't know if their well is

00:34:00.340 --> 00:34:01.570
full enough to overflow.

00:34:01.570 --> 00:34:04.150
And I feel like you should use
life to overflow your well,

00:34:04.150 --> 00:34:07.089
and then like you can't
help but get the story down.

00:34:07.089 --> 00:34:07.880
SACHIT EGAN: I see.

00:34:07.880 --> 00:34:10.489
If we return to the example
of you having a second child

00:34:10.489 --> 00:34:13.670
on the way in six weeks, I
gather that a lot of folks

00:34:13.670 --> 00:34:18.449
will feel very conflicted to
be the responsible parent,

00:34:18.449 --> 00:34:22.270
or to kind of, in a way, pursue
this dream or this calling--

00:34:22.270 --> 00:34:24.520
feelings of guilt,
perhaps, which is a very

00:34:24.520 --> 00:34:26.610
self-defeating sort of feeling.

00:34:26.610 --> 00:34:28.690
How would you advise
people to get over that,

00:34:28.690 --> 00:34:30.523
or would you advise
people to get over that?

00:34:30.523 --> 00:34:33.159
KARAN BAJAJ: I would
say as you keep

00:34:33.159 --> 00:34:36.820
doing more and more such stuff,
the conclusion that you draw

00:34:36.820 --> 00:34:41.550
is that as long as you are
honestly choosing growth

00:34:41.550 --> 00:34:43.610
as a human being, it
always kind of works out.

00:34:45.812 --> 00:34:47.520
But you just have to
get-- like somewhere

00:34:47.520 --> 00:34:50.480
that mindset has to break
that I'm leaving my job

00:34:50.480 --> 00:34:53.000
and I'm not doing the
right thing for my baby.

00:34:53.000 --> 00:34:55.650
I'm like, I'm leaving this
job to work very, very

00:34:55.650 --> 00:34:59.410
intensely on a different job,
which is to write this novel.

00:34:59.410 --> 00:35:02.230
And then I'm going to leave
that job to work very intensely,

00:35:02.230 --> 00:35:07.100
or to work full honesty
on my media company role.

00:35:07.100 --> 00:35:10.304
And you kind of start to see
that everything is like, as

00:35:10.304 --> 00:35:11.720
long as your
intentions are honest

00:35:11.720 --> 00:35:19.324
and you are-- you don't see
that demarcation that much.

00:35:19.324 --> 00:35:20.740
My wife was saying,
are you crazy?

00:35:20.740 --> 00:35:23.140
Sort of a thing like, why
can't you wait for six weeks?

00:35:23.140 --> 00:35:24.410
And I'm like, no, this
is the time to write.

00:35:24.410 --> 00:35:25.620
I'm going to do it.

00:35:25.620 --> 00:35:27.656
And hopefully it will all work.

00:35:27.656 --> 00:35:28.624
It does.

00:35:28.624 --> 00:35:29.540
SACHIT EGAN: For sure.

00:35:29.540 --> 00:35:31.373
I think one thing you
said really resonates.

00:35:31.373 --> 00:35:33.800
You talk about if your
intentions are pure.

00:35:33.800 --> 00:35:36.550
And I think that's profound.

00:35:36.550 --> 00:35:39.480
Here in Silicon Valley-- you
can relate to this-- everything

00:35:39.480 --> 00:35:40.180
is analyzed.

00:35:40.180 --> 00:35:41.760
Everything is overanalyzed.

00:35:41.760 --> 00:35:44.491
For every point there
is a counterpoint.

00:35:44.491 --> 00:35:45.990
For every one person
who thinks, hey

00:35:45.990 --> 00:35:48.710
you're doing great by growing
as a human, nine people

00:35:48.710 --> 00:35:50.540
will say you're
being irresponsible.

00:35:50.540 --> 00:35:54.779
How do you find that
self-assuredness to know, hey,

00:35:54.779 --> 00:35:55.695
I trust my intentions?

00:35:59.480 --> 00:36:01.360
KARAN BAJAJ: The first
time it's hardest.

00:36:01.360 --> 00:36:02.590
Second time, not so hard.

00:36:02.590 --> 00:36:05.880
Third time-- by the
fifth time, you're like,

00:36:05.880 --> 00:36:07.580
my life is my own model.

00:36:07.580 --> 00:36:10.290
There's no model left anymore.

00:36:10.290 --> 00:36:12.860
So I think the first
time-- especially

00:36:12.860 --> 00:36:14.150
we all have our own concerns.

00:36:14.150 --> 00:36:16.620
Like my mom would be
like, are you depressed?

00:36:16.620 --> 00:36:18.520
Why are you leaving
your job to travel?

00:36:18.520 --> 00:36:20.445
Is something wrong in
your-- like you know,

00:36:20.445 --> 00:36:24.130
I was telling you should
have been married by now.

00:36:24.130 --> 00:36:26.470
There's always some
external pressure.

00:36:26.470 --> 00:36:28.630
But now nobody even
questions anything.

00:36:28.630 --> 00:36:31.180
They're just like, he's
on his own mad path.

00:36:31.180 --> 00:36:35.010
By now, there's no sense of
waiting for anybody's judgment

00:36:35.010 --> 00:36:35.670
left anymore.

00:36:35.670 --> 00:36:37.030
So I think the first
time is the hardest.

00:36:37.030 --> 00:36:37.904
So you keep doing it.

00:36:37.904 --> 00:36:40.960
And then by the fifth
time, it's like, there's

00:36:40.960 --> 00:36:42.390
nobody to explain to anymore.

00:36:42.390 --> 00:36:43.348
SACHIT EGAN: Very cool.

00:36:43.348 --> 00:36:43.986
Appreciate it.

00:36:43.986 --> 00:36:45.860
I'd love to turn it over
to you guys as well.

00:36:45.860 --> 00:36:48.525
Angela, if you don't mind
being the mic person.

00:36:48.525 --> 00:36:49.670
Just raise your hand.

00:37:00.060 --> 00:37:06.640
AUDIENCE: Are there any
practical or logistical things

00:37:06.640 --> 00:37:11.320
that you've had to give up
to prepare for your next

00:37:11.320 --> 00:37:12.110
sabbatical?

00:37:12.110 --> 00:37:14.580
Like a small one
might be like, I'm

00:37:14.580 --> 00:37:17.830
not going to own a pet because
then the logistics of leaving

00:37:17.830 --> 00:37:21.420
are going to be too hard,
or something more serious.

00:37:21.420 --> 00:37:24.890
KARAN BAJAJ: It's such
a beautiful question

00:37:24.890 --> 00:37:27.050
because I do want to
[INAUDIBLE] like so.

00:37:27.050 --> 00:37:29.080
So why I think it's a
very interesting question

00:37:29.080 --> 00:37:30.370
is because I think
my wife and have I

00:37:30.370 --> 00:37:31.911
talked a little bit
about that, which

00:37:31.911 --> 00:37:37.540
is to just jump into
life fully and not think

00:37:37.540 --> 00:37:40.816
about almost the next step.

00:37:40.816 --> 00:37:43.735
So for example we're moving
to India now on October 2

00:37:43.735 --> 00:37:44.610
to take on this role.

00:37:44.610 --> 00:37:46.650
We have a five-month-old
and a two-year-old

00:37:46.650 --> 00:37:49.209
and all that stuff.

00:37:49.209 --> 00:37:51.750
And we have a pet which we're
leaving with my wife's parents.

00:37:51.750 --> 00:37:53.790
It's a little heart wrenching.

00:37:53.790 --> 00:37:56.130
But would I have not had
the pet because of that?

00:37:56.130 --> 00:37:56.630
No.

00:37:56.630 --> 00:38:00.040
But it's almost like we're
just diving in and saying

00:38:00.040 --> 00:38:03.320
yes, yes, yes, and not thinking
too much about-- it always

00:38:03.320 --> 00:38:05.342
has a way of working out.

00:38:05.342 --> 00:38:06.300
But it's to your point.

00:38:06.300 --> 00:38:07.394
It's a very great point.

00:38:07.394 --> 00:38:08.810
But there's some
things that I do.

00:38:08.810 --> 00:38:10.770
I don't buy a house ever.

00:38:10.770 --> 00:38:12.390
That's just a philosophy.

00:38:12.390 --> 00:38:15.272
At this age, everybody
in India has five houses.

00:38:15.272 --> 00:38:15.980
But I don't know.

00:38:15.980 --> 00:38:18.070
People invest in this
land and that property.

00:38:18.070 --> 00:38:21.890
I don't invest in anything
which can weigh me down at all.

00:38:21.890 --> 00:38:23.390
So there's some
choices that I make.

00:38:23.390 --> 00:38:25.681
But for the most part, we're
diving into the experience

00:38:25.681 --> 00:38:27.690
of being.

00:38:27.690 --> 00:38:31.090
So we decided to have
a-- for example, anybody

00:38:31.090 --> 00:38:34.720
would question why go to Mumbai
with a five-month-old American

00:38:34.720 --> 00:38:36.900
kid who's going to
be like obviously

00:38:36.900 --> 00:38:39.660
assaulted from the
senses completely

00:38:39.660 --> 00:38:42.600
and is going to have obviously
have some digestion problems.

00:38:42.600 --> 00:38:44.940
But we're just like,
let's just dive in

00:38:44.940 --> 00:38:48.489
and see what it takes you.

00:38:48.489 --> 00:38:50.280
Perhaps we should think
more, but we don't.

00:39:03.729 --> 00:39:06.270
AUDIENCE: How do you bring your
partner or girlfriend or wife

00:39:06.270 --> 00:39:09.170
at the time to join you
in those sabbaticals?

00:39:09.170 --> 00:39:10.455
Or do you go on your own?

00:39:10.455 --> 00:39:12.330
KARAN BAJAJ: No, the
first two were because I

00:39:12.330 --> 00:39:13.538
was single for the most part.

00:39:13.538 --> 00:39:14.480
So I went on my own.

00:39:14.480 --> 00:39:17.560
But the next one, like we
were in a relationship.

00:39:17.560 --> 00:39:22.472
And I think what happens is once
you start building the muscle--

00:39:22.472 --> 00:39:24.430
the first one, when you
do it even on your own,

00:39:24.430 --> 00:39:26.820
it's difficult. It's not as
hunky dory as I make it here.

00:39:26.820 --> 00:39:28.510
I guess you are very conflicted.

00:39:28.510 --> 00:39:29.880
You do it.

00:39:29.880 --> 00:39:32.340
And even when you're doing
it, I had those moments

00:39:32.340 --> 00:39:34.460
when I was like, how
did I become a hippie?

00:39:34.460 --> 00:39:36.390
I was supposed to
be this and that.

00:39:36.390 --> 00:39:38.810
So you go through those
self-doubts and stuff.

00:39:38.810 --> 00:39:40.860
The next one is you
build the muscle.

00:39:40.860 --> 00:39:43.110
Then the same thing what
happens is with your partner.

00:39:43.110 --> 00:39:45.020
It's harder to do,
because you have

00:39:45.020 --> 00:39:46.690
to have two jobs that
have to be planned

00:39:46.690 --> 00:39:48.260
and sabbaticals and stuff.

00:39:48.260 --> 00:39:50.169
But eventually you do
that, and you kind of

00:39:50.169 --> 00:39:51.460
build the muscle for next time.

00:39:51.460 --> 00:39:52.920
And you do it for the kids.

00:39:52.920 --> 00:39:59.150
So I think what happens is that
progressively, the journey gets

00:39:59.150 --> 00:39:59.920
easier.

00:39:59.920 --> 00:40:01.860
You just keep
building the muscle.

00:40:01.860 --> 00:40:05.310
So my recommendation on that is
to try a month off rather than

00:40:05.310 --> 00:40:06.900
just jump into a year.

00:40:06.900 --> 00:40:10.170
Do something which builds
your guys [INAUDIBLE].

00:40:10.170 --> 00:40:12.680
And then slowly that one
month will become three.

00:40:12.680 --> 00:40:16.740
And then the next you both will
be aligned to take the plunge.

00:40:16.740 --> 00:40:19.496
You can you keep building
the muscle, and yeah-- yeah.

00:40:22.840 --> 00:40:25.210
AUDIENCE: I have a follow
on to that question.

00:40:25.210 --> 00:40:28.220
Can you talk about the pros and
cons of doing a sabbatical solo

00:40:28.220 --> 00:40:31.620
versus with your partner?

00:40:31.620 --> 00:40:36.990
KARAN BAJAJ: For me they were
mostly pros, this time over.

00:40:36.990 --> 00:40:39.647
But there was a lot of merit
that I was doing it on my own

00:40:39.647 --> 00:40:40.147
also.

00:40:43.680 --> 00:40:46.530
I don't know if there is
a straight answer to-- I

00:40:46.530 --> 00:40:48.370
don't know if it's a choice.

00:40:48.370 --> 00:40:51.090
If you have a partner,
would you guys

00:40:51.090 --> 00:40:55.990
be comfortable taking a year
off away from each other?

00:40:55.990 --> 00:41:00.420
Like for me, we never even
contemplated that question

00:41:00.420 --> 00:41:02.160
and we just did it
together, if you will.

00:41:02.160 --> 00:41:03.874
AUDIENCE: Yeah, I
was just wondering

00:41:03.874 --> 00:41:06.742
is it-- I personally,
I can see it both ways.

00:41:06.742 --> 00:41:08.176
I can see it being
very fulfilling

00:41:08.176 --> 00:41:11.009
going by yourself, if you have
that trust with a partner,

00:41:11.009 --> 00:41:13.300
leaving the partner behind
if it doesn't work for them.

00:41:13.300 --> 00:41:16.855
But I was curious, was
one experience better

00:41:16.855 --> 00:41:17.584
than the other?

00:41:17.584 --> 00:41:19.250
KARAN BAJAJ: Very
different experiences.

00:41:19.250 --> 00:41:23.580
I think the difference though
is that you grow so much

00:41:23.580 --> 00:41:25.220
in that year, grow so much.

00:41:25.220 --> 00:41:28.080
And it's very apparent,
but so many aspects of you

00:41:28.080 --> 00:41:30.210
change that when
you come back, it'll

00:41:30.210 --> 00:41:32.050
be a little hard if
the other person hasn't

00:41:32.050 --> 00:41:33.800
gone through the same
experience with you.

00:41:33.800 --> 00:41:37.200
So I won't have worried
too much about the year.

00:41:37.200 --> 00:41:40.180
But after spending six
months in an ashram,

00:41:40.180 --> 00:41:42.682
writing a novel in the
Portuguese artist retreat,

00:41:42.682 --> 00:41:44.140
going from Europe
to India by road,

00:41:44.140 --> 00:41:47.030
through that whole experience,
a very different form of you

00:41:47.030 --> 00:41:47.530
emerges.

00:41:47.530 --> 00:41:49.905
And then if that other person
hasn't had that experience,

00:41:49.905 --> 00:41:52.837
it's a very big, I
would say, disconnect.

00:41:52.837 --> 00:41:54.920
I don't think our relationship
would have survived

00:41:54.920 --> 00:41:56.170
if I'd just done it on my own.

00:42:05.887 --> 00:42:07.470
AUDIENCE: I was
wondering if you could

00:42:07.470 --> 00:42:09.770
talk a little bit about
your writing process, things

00:42:09.770 --> 00:42:14.695
like same kind of block
of time during each day.

00:42:14.695 --> 00:42:17.785
Do you outline the
whole thing first?

00:42:17.785 --> 00:42:20.480
Do you write very
quick first drafts

00:42:20.480 --> 00:42:23.640
and then edit over and
over and over again?

00:42:23.640 --> 00:42:26.840
KARAN BAJAJ: The writing
process, for me, it

00:42:26.840 --> 00:42:29.740
is a good combination of
tight and slack, almost

00:42:29.740 --> 00:42:31.210
like my life in
some ways that I'm

00:42:31.210 --> 00:42:33.280
very goal driven
and disciplined,

00:42:33.280 --> 00:42:36.000
and then I completely let
loose when the goal driven

00:42:36.000 --> 00:42:39.440
and discipline period-- I'm
kind of a bit of a maniac.

00:42:39.440 --> 00:42:42.520
I know that I'm going to write
Monday, Tuesday and Thursday,

00:42:42.520 --> 00:42:45.170
one hour each after work, or 1
and 1/2 hours each after work,

00:42:45.170 --> 00:42:47.430
and produce 400 words.

00:42:47.430 --> 00:42:49.880
So it's almost very
mathematical to a science.

00:42:49.880 --> 00:42:52.690
And then I like one weekend,
either Saturday or Sunday,

00:42:52.690 --> 00:42:54.920
and I'll write a thousand words.

00:42:54.920 --> 00:42:57.760
If you do that, for
example, in six months

00:42:57.760 --> 00:42:59.010
you'll complete a whole novel.

00:42:59.010 --> 00:43:00.290
That's 80,000 words.

00:43:00.290 --> 00:43:03.240
If you're continuously showing
up and doing that-- and I'm

00:43:03.240 --> 00:43:04.680
very mathematical
almost about it.

00:43:04.680 --> 00:43:06.280
So Monday, Tuesday,
Thursday, so that

00:43:06.280 --> 00:43:09.344
allows me the slack to play
on Wednesday and Friday.

00:43:09.344 --> 00:43:11.510
It allows me to spend one
full weekend with my kids.

00:43:11.510 --> 00:43:14.135
But the second weekend, we call
a babysitter and for five hours

00:43:14.135 --> 00:43:16.270
I'm working on my
book or whatever.

00:43:16.270 --> 00:43:17.940
And then I complete the novel.

00:43:17.940 --> 00:43:22.700
But what I notice then is that
the work is very workman like

00:43:22.700 --> 00:43:24.630
and is not magical.

00:43:24.630 --> 00:43:26.542
And then the sabbatical
kind of somehow

00:43:26.542 --> 00:43:28.250
shows up somewhere in
the middle of that,

00:43:28.250 --> 00:43:32.010
and that's when the work
starts to-- I slacken a lot,

00:43:32.010 --> 00:43:34.500
and then the work
becomes magical.

00:43:34.500 --> 00:43:37.020
So I think of this novel, I
had written two drafts before I

00:43:37.020 --> 00:43:39.530
even went on the year off.

00:43:39.530 --> 00:43:42.820
And those drafts
were very linear

00:43:42.820 --> 00:43:45.960
and like a predictable
story, very outline driven.

00:43:45.960 --> 00:43:48.920
And then in the sabbatical, I
didn't write for the first nine

00:43:48.920 --> 00:43:49.420
months.

00:43:49.420 --> 00:43:51.110
As I said, I was in Europe
to India, then in the ashram.

00:43:51.110 --> 00:43:52.485
Then I wrote in
this Portuguese--

00:43:52.485 --> 00:43:54.680
I completed the novel
in this artist retreat.

00:43:54.680 --> 00:43:58.190
And what I've written in that
period is very transcendental.

00:43:58.190 --> 00:43:59.780
I can't even
recognize it anymore.

00:43:59.780 --> 00:44:00.650
If you asked me
to write it again,

00:44:00.650 --> 00:44:02.066
I would never be
able to write it.

00:44:02.066 --> 00:44:03.680
It just took on
its own-- it came

00:44:03.680 --> 00:44:05.660
from a place of deep silence.

00:44:05.660 --> 00:44:08.290
No goals because in this
artist retreat, I was not like,

00:44:08.290 --> 00:44:10.100
I'm going to clock
these number of words.

00:44:10.100 --> 00:44:11.850
I was just being very
inspired in writing.

00:44:11.850 --> 00:44:15.080
So it's a combination of
very much a lot of discipline

00:44:15.080 --> 00:44:18.190
and then a lot of free slack.

00:44:18.190 --> 00:44:20.800
And that combination I
think really cracks it.

00:44:20.800 --> 00:44:24.300
If it was like leaning
too much in one direction,

00:44:24.300 --> 00:44:27.700
I would not get the work done,
like in this free flow thing.

00:44:27.700 --> 00:44:31.860
Or I would be so workman like
that it doesn't inspire me

00:44:31.860 --> 00:44:32.360
at all.

00:44:36.282 --> 00:44:37.990
SACHIT EGAN: One quick
follow up to that.

00:44:37.990 --> 00:44:39.531
You talked about
this briefly before.

00:44:39.531 --> 00:44:43.000
To me, creativity
feels hard to box.

00:44:43.000 --> 00:44:45.150
If I set out for
Monday, Tuesday,

00:44:45.150 --> 00:44:48.280
Thursday to write 100,
200, 300, 400 words,

00:44:48.280 --> 00:44:50.500
it's hard to predict,
will the idea

00:44:50.500 --> 00:44:54.500
for the rest of this
chapter come to me now?

00:44:54.500 --> 00:44:56.010
How do you take breaks?

00:44:56.010 --> 00:44:57.061
How you stop for the day?

00:44:57.061 --> 00:44:59.310
Do you just write down the
rest of your ideas quickly?

00:44:59.310 --> 00:44:59.920
What do you do?

00:44:59.920 --> 00:45:01.753
KARAN BAJAJ: No, I just
keep-- like I almost

00:45:01.753 --> 00:45:04.520
feel like it's my duty
to show up in this period

00:45:04.520 --> 00:45:08.860
and work for 1 and 1/2 hours.

00:45:08.860 --> 00:45:11.660
And typically that
means producing 300,

00:45:11.660 --> 00:45:12.960
400 words is what I've noticed.

00:45:12.960 --> 00:45:14.790
So I'm almost like
very-- then obviously

00:45:14.790 --> 00:45:17.460
some days when it
doesn't come at all.

00:45:17.460 --> 00:45:19.630
But I'm more committed to
the idea of let me show up

00:45:19.630 --> 00:45:21.726
and do that, and then
maybe delete it later.

00:45:21.726 --> 00:45:24.350
Very comfortable with this idea,
to your question, first drafts

00:45:24.350 --> 00:45:25.637
and stuff.

00:45:25.637 --> 00:45:27.220
But I think it's
very important for me

00:45:27.220 --> 00:45:30.270
to show up and not be like,
I'm not feeling inspired today.

00:45:30.270 --> 00:45:32.770
SACHIT EGAN: I guess what I
mean is let's say you do show up

00:45:32.770 --> 00:45:34.020
and you feel super inspired.

00:45:34.020 --> 00:45:36.890
And hour and a half passes and
you just feel like, keep going.

00:45:36.890 --> 00:45:38.479
How do you contain--

00:45:38.479 --> 00:45:40.270
KARAN BAJAJ: No,
actually, if that happens,

00:45:40.270 --> 00:45:41.710
then I'm really
inspired to keep going.

00:45:41.710 --> 00:45:42.751
Then I don't stop myself.

00:45:42.751 --> 00:45:44.950
The opposite I do.

00:45:44.950 --> 00:45:46.890
But once you have a
couple of kids and stuff

00:45:46.890 --> 00:45:50.150
and you've done a full time
job and you come back at home,

00:45:50.150 --> 00:45:51.920
it's very hard to
feel that inspired

00:45:51.920 --> 00:45:55.420
to just keep plugging
away after-- I

00:45:55.420 --> 00:45:56.415
start to swim a little.

00:46:03.294 --> 00:46:05.749
AUDIENCE: So you mentioned
you have two kids.

00:46:05.749 --> 00:46:07.720
So when you would do
those sabbaticals,

00:46:07.720 --> 00:46:09.866
did you bring them with you?

00:46:09.866 --> 00:46:12.240
KARAN BAJAJ: Because we had
it after the last sabbatical.

00:46:12.240 --> 00:46:15.880
But we tried out an experiment
of taking six weeks off

00:46:15.880 --> 00:46:22.540
in Costa Rica recently, with the
kids, to see how it would work.

00:46:22.540 --> 00:46:24.290
And it worked very well.

00:46:24.290 --> 00:46:26.770
The whole point was that
if you can construct-- kids

00:46:26.770 --> 00:46:28.780
are like pets in a way.

00:46:28.780 --> 00:46:31.560
If you construct a
routine for them,

00:46:31.560 --> 00:46:34.770
if you just take that routine--
if you leave it unstructured,

00:46:34.770 --> 00:46:36.360
then obviously
they won't thrive.

00:46:36.360 --> 00:46:38.070
But if you go to
Costa Rica you're

00:46:38.070 --> 00:46:40.470
creating a similar routine
that you drop them in--

00:46:40.470 --> 00:46:42.310
so it's a small preparation.

00:46:42.310 --> 00:46:43.970
Like to look for
daycares in Costa Rica

00:46:43.970 --> 00:46:45.930
and do exactly the same routine.

00:46:45.930 --> 00:46:48.535
The goal, you drop them to a
daycare and you do your work

00:46:48.535 --> 00:46:49.410
and you pick them up.

00:46:49.410 --> 00:46:50.250
So it's very--

00:46:50.250 --> 00:46:51.500
AUDIENCE: Was there in school?

00:46:51.500 --> 00:46:53.029
I'm not sure how that--

00:46:53.029 --> 00:46:54.320
KARAN BAJAJ: Yeah, that's true.

00:46:54.320 --> 00:46:56.490
But I have friends
who are doing it now,

00:46:56.490 --> 00:46:59.660
they just shift to
a-- so my friend

00:46:59.660 --> 00:47:02.760
just did it with kids
who are 13, 11, and 10.

00:47:02.760 --> 00:47:06.660
And they basically shifted
from the US to Spain,

00:47:06.660 --> 00:47:10.260
and shifted them for
one year in that school.

00:47:10.260 --> 00:47:12.120
And apparently the
kids loved it so

00:47:12.120 --> 00:47:13.896
much they didn't want to leave.

00:47:13.896 --> 00:47:15.520
And then they did
that three years ago,

00:47:15.520 --> 00:47:16.750
and they're doing it again.

00:47:16.750 --> 00:47:19.204
They're doing one more year
at a very funny stage, 17,

00:47:19.204 --> 00:47:21.370
when they're just about, I
guess, go to [INAUDIBLE].

00:47:21.370 --> 00:47:25.480
So they're doing it at
17, 15, and 14 now, again.

00:47:25.480 --> 00:47:27.891
So they just constructed
like the exact life

00:47:27.891 --> 00:47:28.765
in a different place.

00:47:33.815 --> 00:47:35.190
AUDIENCE: How did
you decide what

00:47:35.190 --> 00:47:36.410
you want in your sabbatical?

00:47:36.410 --> 00:47:38.970
Did you preplan that
you want to spend

00:47:38.970 --> 00:47:41.490
three months at this place and
three months at that place?

00:47:41.490 --> 00:47:43.489
KARAN BAJAJ: It's a very
good question actually.

00:47:43.489 --> 00:47:47.670
What I felt is that anchored
events are very good.

00:47:47.670 --> 00:47:51.750
So for us, we knew that the
anchor event was yoga teachers

00:47:51.750 --> 00:47:53.040
training in India in November.

00:47:53.040 --> 00:47:55.706
But we didn't know what we would
do between August and November.

00:47:55.706 --> 00:47:59.470
So it was good to have the
sense that we would reach India,

00:47:59.470 --> 00:48:02.070
but how we would reach
India, what would happen

00:48:02.070 --> 00:48:04.600
in those three months-- like
we just had this idea that we

00:48:04.600 --> 00:48:07.790
would take the cheapest
mode of transport and living

00:48:07.790 --> 00:48:08.855
everywhere.

00:48:08.855 --> 00:48:10.230
And that was the
whole construct.

00:48:10.230 --> 00:48:13.744
So that meant never having a
car, never taking a flight,

00:48:13.744 --> 00:48:15.910
just being on the road or
ferries or all that stuff,

00:48:15.910 --> 00:48:18.810
and just kept drifting along
and reach India eventually,

00:48:18.810 --> 00:48:20.830
through China and all
this like random places

00:48:20.830 --> 00:48:22.130
and just keep drifting,
drifting, drifting

00:48:22.130 --> 00:48:22.520
until we reached.

00:48:22.520 --> 00:48:24.728
But then it was good to have
the anchor that we would

00:48:24.728 --> 00:48:26.259
do yoga teachers training.

00:48:26.259 --> 00:48:27.800
Then there was
another anchor that we

00:48:27.800 --> 00:48:29.508
would do the Camino
de Santiago, which is

00:48:29.508 --> 00:48:31.051
this wonderful hike in Spain.

00:48:31.051 --> 00:48:32.550
And there was another
anchor that we

00:48:32.550 --> 00:48:34.820
would do it in five months
time around March, April.

00:48:34.820 --> 00:48:36.570
That's very good
timing to do it.

00:48:36.570 --> 00:48:38.507
So that was the
other anchor event.

00:48:38.507 --> 00:48:40.340
So there are anchor
events, but then there's

00:48:40.340 --> 00:48:41.131
a lot of free flow.

00:48:51.010 --> 00:48:53.520
AUDIENCE: Are there any day to
day or week to week practices

00:48:53.520 --> 00:48:57.410
that you do to help sort of
align with this lifestyle

00:48:57.410 --> 00:49:01.234
while you're unfolding versus
trying to become something?

00:49:01.234 --> 00:49:02.400
KARAN BAJAJ: Like the usual.

00:49:02.400 --> 00:49:05.170
I do try to meditate.

00:49:05.170 --> 00:49:09.135
Definitely I meditate in the
night before I hit to bed.

00:49:09.135 --> 00:49:10.510
The morning is
very unpredictable

00:49:10.510 --> 00:49:12.490
with two young kids,
can be unpredictable.

00:49:12.490 --> 00:49:16.010
But I do definitely meditate.

00:49:16.010 --> 00:49:17.710
I think there are
three things, really,

00:49:17.710 --> 00:49:23.280
to answer that question,
like meditation, creation.

00:49:23.280 --> 00:49:24.989
I think creation always
keeps you honest.

00:49:24.989 --> 00:49:26.571
So even if I'm not
working on a novel,

00:49:26.571 --> 00:49:29.140
I'm blogging and doing my-- I
just do my five minute YouTube

00:49:29.140 --> 00:49:30.050
videos.

00:49:30.050 --> 00:49:31.550
I think creation
has a beautiful way

00:49:31.550 --> 00:49:35.406
of synthesizing your thoughts.

00:49:35.406 --> 00:49:38.030
When you write a blog post, you
are forced to almost synthesize

00:49:38.030 --> 00:49:38.520
your thoughts.

00:49:38.520 --> 00:49:40.478
And I have a good audience
who reads the blogs.

00:49:40.478 --> 00:49:42.250
I get a lot of feedback to them.

00:49:42.250 --> 00:49:46.180
So I think it's meditation,
creation, and then hiking,

00:49:46.180 --> 00:49:48.355
like kind of a tough
hike or something.

00:49:48.355 --> 00:49:49.730
Basically the idea
is that you're

00:49:49.730 --> 00:49:53.530
doing an activity that
completely breaks down

00:49:53.530 --> 00:49:56.500
your world and transports you
to a different world on a more

00:49:56.500 --> 00:49:57.560
regular basis.

00:49:57.560 --> 00:49:59.530
So same with a tough
hike, you just completely

00:49:59.530 --> 00:50:01.340
forget yourself
when you're hiking.

00:50:01.340 --> 00:50:03.423
So I think those are the
three kind of activities.

00:50:08.389 --> 00:50:08.930
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:50:08.930 --> 00:50:10.730
This is a little offbeat.

00:50:10.730 --> 00:50:12.430
It's related to the book.

00:50:12.430 --> 00:50:16.140
So you talk about how
doing meditation sort of

00:50:16.140 --> 00:50:18.770
brings you more
realizations and awareness,

00:50:18.770 --> 00:50:21.280
and answers a lot of
questions that you have.

00:50:21.280 --> 00:50:23.370
So I wanted to know,
what kind of meditation

00:50:23.370 --> 00:50:24.960
did you start off with?

00:50:24.960 --> 00:50:27.530
And even when you start
off with something,

00:50:27.530 --> 00:50:30.240
your thought is a
certain practice.

00:50:30.240 --> 00:50:31.870
So you start practicing it.

00:50:31.870 --> 00:50:34.100
And do you just
continue doing that,

00:50:34.100 --> 00:50:38.670
and do these realizations
start anew in the process?

00:50:38.670 --> 00:50:40.700
KARAN BAJAJ: Excellent question.

00:50:40.700 --> 00:50:45.709
I think the pyramid of the
meditation experience, which

00:50:45.709 --> 00:50:48.000
I found worked and has worked
obviously in the Buddhist

00:50:48.000 --> 00:50:51.260
scripture as well is that
you start with what they call

00:50:51.260 --> 00:50:55.397
morality, which is a basic
level of love for yourself

00:50:55.397 --> 00:50:56.230
and love for others.

00:50:56.230 --> 00:51:00.450
That means changing
your diet to be

00:51:00.450 --> 00:51:03.469
like less agitating,
less caffeine,

00:51:03.469 --> 00:51:05.010
less alcohol, all
that kind of stuff.

00:51:05.010 --> 00:51:06.830
You kind of lay the
foundation of that.

00:51:06.830 --> 00:51:09.030
Then you go over to
concentration based meditation

00:51:09.030 --> 00:51:11.690
where you use a
form as a surrogate

00:51:11.690 --> 00:51:15.940
to build that ability of the
mind to go from scattered

00:51:15.940 --> 00:51:17.090
to one pointed.

00:51:17.090 --> 00:51:19.880
And then the concentration based
meditation evolves by itself

00:51:19.880 --> 00:51:21.790
to the awareness,
mindfulness states

00:51:21.790 --> 00:51:23.840
where there is no form at all.

00:51:23.840 --> 00:51:26.130
You are comfortable with
formlessness, if you will.

00:51:28.730 --> 00:51:31.490
But what I've seen
is that they just

00:51:31.490 --> 00:51:32.930
happen on their own accord.

00:51:32.930 --> 00:51:35.000
I didn't have this
construct in the beginning.

00:51:35.000 --> 00:51:37.730
Later when I started to
see why-- in the beginning,

00:51:37.730 --> 00:51:39.080
I was very form based.

00:51:39.080 --> 00:51:44.280
I would meditate on an image,
use my breadth, use a mantra.

00:51:44.280 --> 00:51:47.000
I had a very form based
practice to build concentration.

00:51:47.000 --> 00:51:50.210
And then the forms started
to disappear on their own.

00:51:50.210 --> 00:51:51.460
I no longer needed forms.

00:51:51.460 --> 00:51:53.418
But I didn't make this
choice that OK, now I've

00:51:53.418 --> 00:51:55.790
achieved some greatness in
form, I'll go to formless.

00:51:55.790 --> 00:51:57.289
But I think that's
what I've noticed

00:51:57.289 --> 00:51:59.540
is the pattern that happened
is that the moment I

00:51:59.540 --> 00:52:04.172
became more one pointed, the
forms disappeared on their own.

00:52:04.172 --> 00:52:06.222
AUDIENCE: How much
did you meditate?

00:52:06.222 --> 00:52:08.430
KARAN BAJAJ: In the beginning
I was very disciplined.

00:52:08.430 --> 00:52:10.640
So in the beginning I was
very, very disciplined

00:52:10.640 --> 00:52:12.889
about putting 30 minutes in
the morning and 30 minutes

00:52:12.889 --> 00:52:14.240
in the night every day.

00:52:14.240 --> 00:52:15.970
And in the beginning
I actually started

00:52:15.970 --> 00:52:17.270
to construct a similar
thing that I'll

00:52:17.270 --> 00:52:19.590
do Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday,
Thursday, not Friday.

00:52:19.590 --> 00:52:23.040
But I started to see the
benefits of it very quickly.

00:52:23.040 --> 00:52:24.870
And so I did it
every day almost.

00:52:24.870 --> 00:52:27.410
And so I almost did
that for a year or two

00:52:27.410 --> 00:52:29.810
before taking the sabbatical
to kind of deep dive

00:52:29.810 --> 00:52:31.140
into things and stuff.

00:52:31.140 --> 00:52:33.515
I would highly recommend, if
you haven't done it already,

00:52:33.515 --> 00:52:36.950
Vipassana is a beautiful--
which everybody should do.

00:52:36.950 --> 00:52:40.520
It's a ten day silent
meditation retreat.

00:52:40.520 --> 00:52:43.842
It's beautiful because
it's fully funded, that you

00:52:43.842 --> 00:52:44.800
don't pay for anything.

00:52:44.800 --> 00:52:47.800
You're going to a place
where the lodging is free,

00:52:47.800 --> 00:52:49.290
the food is free.

00:52:49.290 --> 00:52:52.000
And you are given this very
rigorous instruction from 4:00

00:52:52.000 --> 00:52:54.180
in the morning till
10:00 in the night,

00:52:54.180 --> 00:52:57.262
and you don't speak at all
for nine out of those 10 days.

00:52:57.262 --> 00:52:58.720
The beauty of
everything being paid

00:52:58.720 --> 00:53:02.670
for is that you don't complain
and mourn because you truly

00:53:02.670 --> 00:53:04.680
approach that whole
experience like a monk

00:53:04.680 --> 00:53:07.551
with a begging bowl, because
you're like somebody's

00:53:07.551 --> 00:53:08.800
just paying for me to do this.

00:53:08.800 --> 00:53:10.216
I can't just sit
here and complain

00:53:10.216 --> 00:53:11.370
about how difficult it is.

00:53:11.370 --> 00:53:13.550
You just surrender
to it completely.

00:53:13.550 --> 00:53:14.800
I would highly recommend that.

00:53:14.800 --> 00:53:16.240
There are many
centers all around

00:53:16.240 --> 00:53:18.350
and they're very
consistent everywhere.

00:53:18.350 --> 00:53:19.772
They do the same practice.

00:53:19.772 --> 00:53:21.480
It's a beautiful way
to start meditating.

00:53:21.480 --> 00:53:23.396
That's also very
concentration based approach.

00:53:30.460 --> 00:53:32.170
AUDIENCE: Very, provoking.

00:53:32.170 --> 00:53:34.934
So I can see why blood pressure
going up in your speech,

00:53:34.934 --> 00:53:36.850
thinking if I should
take a sabbatical or not.

00:53:36.850 --> 00:53:40.496
So you mentioned about the
word [INAUDIBLE] a few times.

00:53:42.882 --> 00:53:44.590
They were in your
sabbatical, [INAUDIBLE]

00:53:44.590 --> 00:53:46.400
out in that one year.

00:53:46.400 --> 00:53:48.730
But when you go back,
we see your graph

00:53:48.730 --> 00:53:51.820
showing your career
progression to the right,

00:53:51.820 --> 00:53:54.035
going from manager
to director and being

00:53:54.035 --> 00:53:57.190
a CEO, which for me is
a sign that you have

00:53:57.190 --> 00:54:02.030
that ambition of progression,
getting rewarded accordingly,

00:54:02.030 --> 00:54:03.660
making more money probably.

00:54:03.660 --> 00:54:06.250
So I wonder if,
before everything

00:54:06.250 --> 00:54:08.960
started, if you had some
financial goals in your mind.

00:54:08.960 --> 00:54:12.170
So at a certain age, I
want to be at this point,

00:54:12.170 --> 00:54:15.730
and if that changed at all,
or if you still have it?

00:54:15.730 --> 00:54:19.610
KARAN BAJAJ: Great question,
because I can't even believe

00:54:19.610 --> 00:54:20.760
how much it's transformed.

00:54:20.760 --> 00:54:23.140
To give you an example,
when my wife and I climbed

00:54:23.140 --> 00:54:26.680
Kilimanjaro-- that was
like about five years ago,

00:54:26.680 --> 00:54:29.000
four years ago.

00:54:29.000 --> 00:54:30.620
And she mentions that now.

00:54:30.620 --> 00:54:32.420
She was girlfriend
then obviously.

00:54:32.420 --> 00:54:37.412
I had this red diary in which
I was noting down my plans,

00:54:37.412 --> 00:54:39.120
because I was so
inspired in Kilimanjaro,

00:54:39.120 --> 00:54:41.030
I was just like noting
down how I would,

00:54:41.030 --> 00:54:44.310
what I would do two years from
now, three years from now,

00:54:44.310 --> 00:54:46.130
by age this, this, this.

00:54:46.130 --> 00:54:48.860
Now I look at it,
I mean, nothing.

00:54:48.860 --> 00:54:50.850
No goals are left at all.

00:54:50.850 --> 00:54:51.560
Nothing is left.

00:54:51.560 --> 00:54:53.870
I mean, till one month
ago, we didn't even

00:54:53.870 --> 00:54:56.440
know that I would take
up a job in Mumbai.

00:54:56.440 --> 00:54:57.510
It came cup.

00:54:57.510 --> 00:54:59.080
I was looking at
a job in Mumbai,

00:54:59.080 --> 00:55:01.700
and at the same time in
New York, in Connecticut.

00:55:01.700 --> 00:55:03.440
And it just was like,
well this is great,

00:55:03.440 --> 00:55:05.565
and we just jumped into--
like I have no idea where

00:55:05.565 --> 00:55:06.770
this role takes me.

00:55:06.770 --> 00:55:08.710
It's completely
changed completely now.

00:55:08.710 --> 00:55:10.541
Now it's really
truly that living

00:55:10.541 --> 00:55:11.790
in the moment sort of a thing.

00:55:11.790 --> 00:55:13.540
Its just like, do your
best in the moment.

00:55:13.540 --> 00:55:15.160
But it's changed dramatically.

00:55:15.160 --> 00:55:18.120
Through all of this, I think
the goallessness has become

00:55:18.120 --> 00:55:20.830
very sound, because I
think some day you realize

00:55:20.830 --> 00:55:25.320
that if your intentions
are right, it all comes,

00:55:25.320 --> 00:55:27.880
all of these things come.

00:55:27.880 --> 00:55:29.930
And you changed so
much in the journey

00:55:29.930 --> 00:55:32.550
that you have lost--
like I know that you're

00:55:32.550 --> 00:55:35.330
going to change so much
going to Mumbai as a family

00:55:35.330 --> 00:55:37.060
and working in this
thing, I'm going

00:55:37.060 --> 00:55:40.120
to change so much that I can
have no static goals at all.

00:55:40.120 --> 00:55:41.940
What I want six months
to one year from now

00:55:41.940 --> 00:55:44.200
is going to be very different
than what I want now.

00:55:44.200 --> 00:55:48.572
So that has disappeared
a lot, yeah.

00:55:48.572 --> 00:55:51.030
SACHIT EGAN: Any other questions
in the audience, maybe one

00:55:51.030 --> 00:55:54.720
more, time for one more?

00:55:54.720 --> 00:55:57.470
If not, I'll throw
one last one at you.

00:55:57.470 --> 00:55:58.850
You exude this positivity.

00:55:58.850 --> 00:56:01.450
I guess it's implicit
in the way you

00:56:01.450 --> 00:56:03.990
are willing to jump
without a plan,

00:56:03.990 --> 00:56:05.560
not worried about
taking the kids

00:56:05.560 --> 00:56:07.893
on a sabbatical, which would
freak, I think, a lot of us

00:56:07.893 --> 00:56:09.040
out.

00:56:09.040 --> 00:56:11.530
I guess I'm curious, is that
an implicit positivity that's

00:56:11.530 --> 00:56:12.613
always been there for you?

00:56:12.613 --> 00:56:13.594
Have you developed it?

00:56:13.594 --> 00:56:14.600
Has it grown?

00:56:14.600 --> 00:56:16.640
KARAN BAJAJ: No,
exactly like that.

00:56:16.640 --> 00:56:18.640
Think of this obviously,
like not negative.

00:56:18.640 --> 00:56:20.000
I was reasonably a positive guy.

00:56:20.000 --> 00:56:23.542
But I was a regular worrier.

00:56:23.542 --> 00:56:25.500
You come from an Indian
family, most of us come

00:56:25.500 --> 00:56:27.975
from very ethnic background.

00:56:27.975 --> 00:56:30.100
Obviously we're here, so
we've come from people who

00:56:30.100 --> 00:56:31.729
are very kind of regimented.

00:56:31.729 --> 00:56:33.270
You come from those
kind of families,

00:56:33.270 --> 00:56:38.850
you're obviously very
worried about life.

00:56:38.850 --> 00:56:42.100
You want it to be a certain way.

00:56:42.100 --> 00:56:45.630
And I remember at
age 31 reaching

00:56:45.630 --> 00:56:48.850
a point when I'd just come
back from my first sabbatical.

00:56:48.850 --> 00:56:52.230
And at age 31, I
didn't have money.

00:56:52.230 --> 00:56:52.785
I was single.

00:56:56.207 --> 00:56:58.540
The recession hit, so I was
very close to losing my job.

00:56:58.540 --> 00:57:01.210
And I was like, how
did this happen?

00:57:01.210 --> 00:57:05.280
At age 31 I was supposed
to be like this Indian guy,

00:57:05.280 --> 00:57:07.250
not this random loser like--

00:57:09.729 --> 00:57:10.270
I don't know.

00:57:10.270 --> 00:57:16.470
So the thing is that now I've
started to believe that it all

00:57:16.470 --> 00:57:17.710
works out.

00:57:17.710 --> 00:57:19.350
As long as your
intentions are pure,

00:57:19.350 --> 00:57:23.780
it always has a way of
connecting to each other.

00:57:23.780 --> 00:57:28.030
That experience at age 31 led
to a very, very good novel,

00:57:28.030 --> 00:57:30.540
because I felt the
depth of despair, which

00:57:30.540 --> 00:57:33.292
lead to great art, which
opened the doors to new things,

00:57:33.292 --> 00:57:35.750
and then life just took off to
a whole different direction.

00:57:35.750 --> 00:57:36.552
So I don't know.

00:57:36.552 --> 00:57:38.260
So I've become more
positive in the sense

00:57:38.260 --> 00:57:41.754
that now I trust completely
that it's going to work out.

00:57:41.754 --> 00:57:43.170
SACHIT EGAN: And
just to piggyback

00:57:43.170 --> 00:57:44.100
with one last thing
about that, something

00:57:44.100 --> 00:57:46.390
that I've seen you
mention on your website

00:57:46.390 --> 00:57:49.060
is on the one hand,
detachment is important

00:57:49.060 --> 00:57:51.100
and you have to find
comfort in being alone.

00:57:51.100 --> 00:57:54.840
In fact in the book, I think
there's a European seeker who

00:57:54.840 --> 00:57:56.520
says that all the
problems in the world

00:57:56.520 --> 00:57:58.770
are because man is
unable to sit alone

00:57:58.770 --> 00:58:01.010
by himself in a room,
which I really liked.

00:58:01.010 --> 00:58:04.740
But you also mentioned
the value of connecting

00:58:04.740 --> 00:58:06.950
with other positive people
or like minded people.

00:58:06.950 --> 00:58:08.950
That community is
really powerful.

00:58:08.950 --> 00:58:10.950
When you are outside that
community, when you're

00:58:10.950 --> 00:58:14.580
working in the corporate
world, that positivity

00:58:14.580 --> 00:58:16.470
is perhaps less present.

00:58:16.470 --> 00:58:18.460
How do you deal with that?

00:58:18.460 --> 00:58:23.550
KARAN BAJAJ: It's a
good point, because-- I

00:58:23.550 --> 00:58:25.940
mean, it's a good-- when you
are on these sabbaticals,

00:58:25.940 --> 00:58:27.900
you actually end
up meeting people.

00:58:27.900 --> 00:58:30.530
Like I was just telling you just
before this conversation also,

00:58:30.530 --> 00:58:32.160
like in a ten day
silent retreat,

00:58:32.160 --> 00:58:34.784
of which nine days you're silent
and not speaking with anybody.

00:58:34.784 --> 00:58:36.570
On the 10th day you're
speaking to people.

00:58:36.570 --> 00:58:38.530
You actually end
up meeting people

00:58:38.530 --> 00:58:41.430
that you feel more
connected to than people

00:58:41.430 --> 00:58:44.120
you've known all your lives,
or friends that you've

00:58:44.120 --> 00:58:45.040
talked to every day.

00:58:45.040 --> 00:58:47.830
Because there's something
about the seeking community,

00:58:47.830 --> 00:58:51.051
if you will, who are all kind of
like dabblers on the same path,

00:58:51.051 --> 00:58:53.300
asking these questions,
struggling with their answers.

00:58:53.300 --> 00:58:55.860
And you feel like that image,
like love and bond for them.

00:58:55.860 --> 00:58:58.580
Yoga teachers training, which
again, I recommend everybody

00:58:58.580 --> 00:59:01.810
do, the six week,
living in an ashram.

00:59:01.810 --> 00:59:05.232
It's like living in college
but completely your people.

00:59:05.232 --> 00:59:06.690
They're all asking
the same things.

00:59:06.690 --> 00:59:08.110
And it's very beautiful.

00:59:08.110 --> 00:59:09.840
And then when you
come back obviously,

00:59:09.840 --> 00:59:11.480
those experiences
are few and far

00:59:11.480 --> 00:59:14.500
in between of that
complete connection.

00:59:14.500 --> 00:59:19.710
I don't know how I-- I guess I
don't come-- it's OK, you know?

00:59:19.710 --> 00:59:23.030
Part of the journey is
silence and aloneness

00:59:23.030 --> 00:59:26.180
and learning through
reading and reflection

00:59:26.180 --> 00:59:27.340
and your own practice.

00:59:27.340 --> 00:59:30.520
And part of the
journey is communal.

00:59:30.520 --> 00:59:31.829
You can't wish for it.

00:59:31.829 --> 00:59:33.620
I guess the bigger
point is that any time I

00:59:33.620 --> 00:59:36.520
start feeling any kind
of a lack in my life,

00:59:36.520 --> 00:59:38.840
I know that my meditation
practice is not working.

00:59:38.840 --> 00:59:42.100
Because the moment that feelings
of lack start to come-- I

00:59:42.100 --> 00:59:45.130
don't have friends,
or I don't have this,

00:59:45.130 --> 00:59:47.875
I don't have that-- I know
that the fundamental assumption

00:59:47.875 --> 00:59:49.250
of this whole
meditation practice

00:59:49.250 --> 00:59:56.740
is that there's a
completeness that exists.

00:59:56.740 --> 00:59:59.170
And you have to kind
of like form oneness

00:59:59.170 --> 01:00:00.490
with that completeness.

01:00:00.490 --> 01:00:02.900
So the moment I'm starting
to think in those thought

01:00:02.900 --> 01:00:04.840
patterns, I know that
I'm slipping somewhere

01:00:04.840 --> 01:00:05.430
in the meditation.

01:00:05.430 --> 01:00:08.096
So I just redouble my meditation
practice I guess is the answer.

01:00:08.096 --> 01:00:09.760
SACHIT EGAN: Well
thanks for that.

01:00:09.760 --> 01:00:13.046
Karan Bajaj's "The Yoga of Max's
Discontent," available now.

01:00:13.046 --> 01:00:15.045
I can't promise you'll
love it as much as I did,

01:00:15.045 --> 01:00:16.482
but it's pretty good.

01:00:16.482 --> 01:00:17.690
Karan, thanks for being here.

01:00:17.690 --> 01:00:18.250
KARAN BAJAJ: It was wonderful.

01:00:18.250 --> 01:00:19.285
Thank you very much.

01:00:19.285 --> 01:00:20.890
[APPLAUSE]
