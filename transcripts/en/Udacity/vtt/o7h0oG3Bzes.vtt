00:00:00.660 --> 00:00:03.870
So today we've talked about scripts, a complex way of understanding stories in

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:06.790
the natural world. Stories aren't just narratives, though.

00:00:06.790 --> 00:00:09.710
Painting, songs, buildings are all stories of different kinds.

00:00:09.710 --> 00:00:14.190
Stories are around us every single day. We started off by defining scripts.

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:17.480
Scripts are causally coherent series of events. They give a prototype for

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:20.270
what to expect in certain situations. The form of

00:00:20.270 --> 00:00:23.238
the general script shows us the form of the overall prototype for the situation.

00:00:23.238 --> 00:00:28.190
A specific instantiation of the script then specifies the content. Scripts can

00:00:28.190 --> 00:00:31.620
have different tracks as well. At a high level, any kind of restaurant involves

00:00:31.620 --> 00:00:35.570
entering, ordering, paying, and leaving. More narrowly though, fast food and

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:38.050
drive through restaurants involve different scripts from casual or

00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:41.890
formal dining. This concludes our unit on common sense reasoning, but

00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:44.690
note that some of what we cover in the future will be applicable to learning,

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:46.510
differentiating, and refining scripts.
