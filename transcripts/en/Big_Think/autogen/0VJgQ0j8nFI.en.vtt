we humans live on earth that we all know

00:00:08.629 --> 00:00:08.639
we humans live on earth that we all know
 

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:11.629
we humans live on earth that we all know
and we can look up at the stars there

00:00:11.629 --> 00:00:11.639
and we can look up at the stars there
 

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:14.659
and we can look up at the stars there
are stars that are close to us and there

00:00:14.659 --> 00:00:14.669
are stars that are close to us and there
 

00:00:14.669 --> 00:00:16.159
are stars that are close to us and there
are stars that are further away

00:00:16.159 --> 00:00:16.169
are stars that are further away
 

00:00:16.169 --> 00:00:18.679
are stars that are further away
belonging to other galaxies and there

00:00:18.679 --> 00:00:18.689
belonging to other galaxies and there
 

00:00:18.689 --> 00:00:20.630
belonging to other galaxies and there
are stars that are extremely far away

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:20.640
are stars that are extremely far away
 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:23.089
are stars that are extremely far away
belonging to extremely far away galaxies

00:00:23.089 --> 00:00:23.099
belonging to extremely far away galaxies
 

00:00:23.099 --> 00:00:27.740
belonging to extremely far away galaxies
now for about a century we know that we

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:27.750
now for about a century we know that we
 

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:31.339
now for about a century we know that we
see that far away galaxies which are

00:00:31.339 --> 00:00:31.349
see that far away galaxies which are
 

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:35.900
see that far away galaxies which are
islands of billions of stars far away

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:35.910
islands of billions of stars far away
 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:38.750
islands of billions of stars far away
galaxies seem to move away from us we

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:38.760
galaxies seem to move away from us we
 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:40.939
galaxies seem to move away from us we
see that the light that reaches us

00:00:40.939 --> 00:00:40.949
see that the light that reaches us
 

00:00:40.949 --> 00:00:43.729
see that the light that reaches us
coming from those galaxies is what they

00:00:43.729 --> 00:00:43.739
coming from those galaxies is what they
 

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:46.070
coming from those galaxies is what they
were the scientists called redshifted

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:46.080
were the scientists called redshifted
 

00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:49.100
were the scientists called redshifted
meaning something has been stretched in

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:49.110
meaning something has been stretched in
 

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:52.009
meaning something has been stretched in
between those galaxies and us what has

00:00:52.009 --> 00:00:52.019
between those galaxies and us what has
 

00:00:52.019 --> 00:00:55.520
between those galaxies and us what has
been stretched is the distance that

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:55.530
been stretched is the distance that
 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:58.880
been stretched is the distance that
separates us from those galaxies as time

00:00:58.880 --> 00:00:58.890
separates us from those galaxies as time
 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:02.350
separates us from those galaxies as time
goes by all the distances in space

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:02.360
goes by all the distances in space
 

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:06.980
goes by all the distances in space
stretch they expand that's what we call

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:06.990
stretch they expand that's what we call
 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:09.859
stretch they expand that's what we call
the expansion of the universe it is not

00:01:09.859 --> 00:01:09.869
the expansion of the universe it is not
 

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:11.870
the expansion of the universe it is not
actually that those faraway stars or

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:11.880
actually that those faraway stars or
 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:14.480
actually that those faraway stars or
galaxies move away from us it is the

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:14.490
galaxies move away from us it is the
 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:17.569
galaxies move away from us it is the
distance in itself that increases there

00:01:17.569 --> 00:01:17.579
distance in itself that increases there
 

00:01:17.579 --> 00:01:20.510
distance in itself that increases there
is more space and time in between them

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:20.520
is more space and time in between them
 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:24.830
is more space and time in between them
now than there was before just to make

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:24.840
now than there was before just to make
 

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:27.800
now than there was before just to make
that point clear that's when you when

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:27.810
that point clear that's when you when
 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:29.510
that point clear that's when you when
you are from on earth and look at the

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:29.520
you are from on earth and look at the
 

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:31.489
you are from on earth and look at the
Stars the expansion of the universe

makes all the faraway galaxies look as

00:01:34.489 --> 00:01:34.499
makes all the faraway galaxies look as
 

00:01:34.499 --> 00:01:38.200
makes all the faraway galaxies look as
if they were moving away but if you

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:38.210
if they were moving away but if you
 

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:40.249
if they were moving away but if you
imagined that you were living somewhere

00:01:40.249 --> 00:01:40.259
imagined that you were living somewhere
 

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:42.469
imagined that you were living somewhere
else in another galaxy far away in the

00:01:42.469 --> 00:01:42.479
else in another galaxy far away in the
 

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:45.889
else in another galaxy far away in the
universe from there all the stars and

universe from there all the stars and
 

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:48.080
universe from there all the stars and
galaxies that are far away would again

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:48.090
galaxies that are far away would again
 

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:51.230

be moving away from you to summarize the

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:51.240
be moving away from you to summarize the
 

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:54.010
be moving away from you to summarize the
expansion of the universe means that

00:01:54.010 --> 00:01:54.020
expansion of the universe means that
 

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:58.520
expansion of the universe means that
distances increase with time that's not

00:01:58.520 --> 00:01:58.530
distances increase with time that's not
 

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:01.209
distances increase with time that's not
something that is completely crazy to

00:02:01.209 --> 00:02:01.219
something that is completely crazy to
 

00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:04.789
something that is completely crazy to
understand if you imagine that the

00:02:04.789 --> 00:02:04.799
understand if you imagine that the
 

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:07.010
understand if you imagine that the
universe started with a big bang meaning

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:07.020
universe started with a big bang meaning
 

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:09.350
universe started with a big bang meaning
that everything we can see in outer

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:09.360
that everything we can see in outer
 

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:12.170
that everything we can see in outer
space right now was condensed in a very

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:12.180
space right now was condensed in a very
 

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:15.860
space right now was condensed in a very
much smaller volume a long time ago then

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:15.870
much smaller volume a long time ago then
 

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:18.590
much smaller volume a long time ago then
somehow some energy got released and

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:18.600
somehow some energy got released and
 

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:19.220
somehow some energy got released and
every

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:19.230
every
 

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:22.930
every
thing expanded okay the universe grew

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:22.940
thing expanded okay the universe grew
 

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:25.070
thing expanded okay the universe grew
but if you think about that carefully

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:25.080
but if you think about that carefully
 

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:28.789
but if you think about that carefully
what that means is that somehow this

00:02:28.789 --> 00:02:28.799
what that means is that somehow this
 

00:02:28.799 --> 00:02:31.789
what that means is that somehow this
expansion this blow-up this Big Bang

00:02:31.789 --> 00:02:31.799
expansion this blow-up this Big Bang
 

00:02:31.799 --> 00:02:35.960
expansion this blow-up this Big Bang

you have an explosion on earth the
objects that are thrown away they slow

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:40.920
objects that are thrown away they slow
 

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:43.369
objects that are thrown away they slow
down because there is friction but

00:02:43.369 --> 00:02:43.379
down because there is friction but
 

00:02:43.379 --> 00:02:44.890
down because there is friction but
because there is something happening

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:44.900
because there is something happening
 

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:47.900
because there is something happening
objects don't keep moving and flying

objects don't keep moving and flying
 

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:51.229
objects don't keep moving and flying
forever they slow down the universe it

00:02:51.229 --> 00:02:51.239
forever they slow down the universe it
 

00:02:51.239 --> 00:02:54.289
forever they slow down the universe it

in 1998 astronomers discovered that it

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:10.890
in 1998 astronomers discovered that it
 

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:12.710
in 1998 astronomers discovered that it
is actually the other way around

00:03:12.710 --> 00:03:12.720
is actually the other way around
 

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:15.559
is actually the other way around
in space looking at faraway galaxies

00:03:15.559 --> 00:03:15.569
in space looking at faraway galaxies
 

00:03:15.569 --> 00:03:18.860
in space looking at faraway galaxies
they realized that the expansion the

they realized that the expansion the
 

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:21.589
they realized that the expansion the
rate of expansion is accelerating so

00:03:21.589 --> 00:03:21.599
rate of expansion is accelerating so
 

00:03:21.599 --> 00:03:23.569
rate of expansion is accelerating so
there is a force pushing away the

00:03:23.569 --> 00:03:23.579
there is a force pushing away the
 

00:03:23.579 --> 00:03:27.319
there is a force pushing away the
faraway galaxies faster and faster with

faraway galaxies faster and faster with
 

00:03:27.329 --> 00:03:30.140
faraway galaxies faster and faster with
time and that's something that gravity

our universe did change something

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:48.150
our universe did change something

our universe did change something
already in the way we picture the future

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:50.430
already in the way we picture the future
 

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:53.360
already in the way we picture the future
of our universe for a long time since we

00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:53.370
of our universe for a long time since we
 

00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:55.460
of our universe for a long time since we
know of the Big Bang there were

00:03:55.460 --> 00:03:55.470
know of the Big Bang there were
 

00:03:55.470 --> 00:03:57.589
know of the Big Bang there were
basically two possibilities for the

00:03:57.589 --> 00:03:57.599
basically two possibilities for the
 

00:03:57.599 --> 00:03:59.659
basically two possibilities for the
future of our universe the first one is

00:03:59.659 --> 00:03:59.669
future of our universe the first one is
 

00:03:59.669 --> 00:04:01.610
future of our universe the first one is
that there is so much matter in there

00:04:01.610 --> 00:04:01.620
that there is so much matter in there
 

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:05.900
that there is so much matter in there
that despite the expansion gravity would

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:05.910
that despite the expansion gravity would
 

00:04:05.910 --> 00:04:08.509
that despite the expansion gravity would
work like some kind of rubberband and

00:04:08.509 --> 00:04:08.519
work like some kind of rubberband and
 

00:04:08.519 --> 00:04:11.449
work like some kind of rubberband and
would bring everything back into what we

00:04:11.449 --> 00:04:11.459
would bring everything back into what we
 

00:04:11.459 --> 00:04:13.940
would bring everything back into what we
call a Big Crunch that everything will

00:04:13.940 --> 00:04:13.950
call a Big Crunch that everything will
 

00:04:13.950 --> 00:04:16.699
call a Big Crunch that everything will
be pulled towards each other at some

00:04:16.699 --> 00:04:16.709
be pulled towards each other at some
 

00:04:16.709 --> 00:04:19.520
be pulled towards each other at some
stage and the expansion would go the

00:04:19.520 --> 00:04:19.530
stage and the expansion would go the
 

00:04:19.530 --> 00:04:21.140
stage and the expansion would go the
other way around and we would have the

00:04:21.140 --> 00:04:21.150
other way around and we would have the
 

00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:23.990
other way around and we would have the
the precise opposite as a Big Bang which

00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:24.000
the precise opposite as a Big Bang which
 

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:26.570
the precise opposite as a Big Bang which
was called Big Crunch the discovery of

00:04:26.570 --> 00:04:26.580
was called Big Crunch the discovery of
 

00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:29.930
was called Big Crunch the discovery of
the accelerated expansion kind of ruled

expanding will keep being getting bigger
and bigger forever that is what we can
