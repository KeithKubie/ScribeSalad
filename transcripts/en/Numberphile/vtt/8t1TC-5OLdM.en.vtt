00:00:02.020 --> 00:00:02.040
JAMES GRIME: 0.

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:03.520
That's our friend.

00:00:03.520 --> 00:00:04.160
Yes.

00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:06.010
To a mathematician
this is a number.

00:00:06.010 --> 00:00:08.400
But it wasn't always obvious.

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:11.720
ROGER BOWLEY: Math existed to do
financial transactions, to

00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:15.580
sell sheep, to buy copper
things, whatever.

00:00:15.580 --> 00:00:17.780
And you would use coins.

00:00:17.780 --> 00:00:19.540
And there would be values
to the coins.

00:00:19.540 --> 00:00:21.965
So you would say this
costs 5 pounds 20

00:00:21.965 --> 00:00:24.020
shillings, or whatever.

00:00:24.020 --> 00:00:26.440
You don't do any trading
with the number 0.

00:00:26.440 --> 00:00:27.900
I've got no sheep here.

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:30.830
Oh, I'm gonna buy no sheep,
I'll give you no pounds.

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:33.250
It doesn't make any sense.

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:36.200
So there was no need
for shopkeepers to

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:37.530
invent the number 0.

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:43.180
JAMES GRIME: They had
the idea of 5 cows.

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:46.760
But the idea of 5,
not so much.

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:49.850
The idea of 5-ness they didn't
quite understand.

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:53.400
So a number like 0, which
is the absence of--

00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:56.430
well, whatever, cows,
whatever it was--

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:57.930
made no sense to them.

00:00:57.930 --> 00:00:59.620
I'm going ask Brady
a question.

00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:01.660
See if I can catch him out.

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:03.800
Brady, is 0 an even number?

00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:08.900
BRADY HARAN: I think
the answer is no.

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:12.470
But it feels like it is
because it is round.

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:14.250
JAMES GRIME: So this
is an interesting--

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:15.170
OK, let me ask another
question.

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:16.820
Is 16 an even number?

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:17.180
BRADY HARAN: Yes.

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:17.680
JAMES GRIME: Yes.

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:20.550
So people have studied this.

00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:22.570
People have a delayed
reaction.

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:25.570
People are not sure whether
0 is an even number.

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:27.190
Now I can tell you that 0,

00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:30.180
categorically, is an even number.

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:34.680
It will follow every definition
of an even number.

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:39.100
ROGER BOWLEY: So there was an
Indian called Brahmagupta who

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:44.200
invented the idea of nothing not
being nothing but existing

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:46.540
as an abstract quantity
in the mathematics.

00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:50.110
Well, then it goes
to North Africa.

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:53.180
And there's a guy called
Al Qasimi.

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:56.780
And he writes a book about the
art of Hindu mathematics and

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:58.910
reckoning by Hindu
mathematics.

00:01:58.910 --> 00:02:03.070
And that spreads through North
Africa to Spain and so forth.

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:05.710
And it becomes, they think,
Arabic numbers.

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:09.789
So you have all the
numbers plus 0.

00:02:09.789 --> 00:02:10.789
That was fine.

00:02:10.789 --> 00:02:16.600
Until 1200 when Leonardo of
Pisa, also known as Fibonacci,

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:18.550
translates this book.

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:20.350
It's a wonderful idea.

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:23.550
But this is in the period
of the Crusades.

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:26.330
So people think these are Arabic
numbers, not Hindu

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:29.800
numbers because it's come
from North Africa.

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:35.200
So the Catholic church objects
to this because there are

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:37.810
Crusades going on and this
is the work of the enemy.

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:41.160
So in Florence, for example,
they banned the use of this

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:43.070
Arabic number 0.

00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:45.720
And it was thought to be
the work of the devil.

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:47.320
BRADY HARAN: Because my
definition of an even number

00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:49.800
is something that can
be divided by 2.

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:53.850
JAMES GRIME: So Brady's just
told me an even number is a

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:55.270
number that can be
divided by 2.

00:02:55.270 --> 00:02:57.980
Well, 0 can be divided by 2.

00:02:57.980 --> 00:03:00.670
0 divided by 2 is 0.

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:04.940
In fact, in that sense, it
is the most even number.

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:08.030
In ancient times they had this
idea of things being singly

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:09.230
even or doubly even.

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:13.420
So 12 would be doubly even
because you can divide by 2

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:14.810
and then 2 again.

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:19.140
Well, by that sense, 0 can be
divided by 2 and 2 and 2 and

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:21.850
2-- it is the most
even number.

00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:25.410
The correct definition of
an even number is it's

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:27.380
a multiple of 2.

00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:29.130
Something times 2.

00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:30.330
Something times 2.

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:31.240
Well, it is.

00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:32.080
There's no problem with that.

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:33.800
It's 0 times 2.

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:35.320
Great.

00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:37.600
Brady said it had to
be divisible by 2.

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:39.560
Well, that works.

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:42.790
0 divide by 2 is 0.

00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:45.025
OK, so it fits between
two odd numbers.

00:03:45.025 --> 00:03:46.930
That might be a definition
for even.

00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:48.100
Let's do that.

00:03:48.100 --> 00:03:49.145
There's 0.

00:03:49.145 --> 00:03:50.855
And over here that's 1.

00:03:50.855 --> 00:03:52.760
Over here that's minus 1.

00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:55.142
And then you get 2 over
here, minus 2.

00:03:55.142 --> 00:03:56.665
Perfectly fits.

00:03:56.665 --> 00:03:58.310
There are some rules
for numbers.

00:03:58.310 --> 00:03:59.630
Some arithmetic rules.

00:03:59.630 --> 00:04:03.170
Two even numbers, if you add two
even numbers together, you

00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:04.610
get an even number.

00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:06.270
Well, that works.

00:04:06.270 --> 00:04:09.480
0 plus 4 is 4, an even
number again.

00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:10.420
That's what we want.

00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:11.920
We're saying 0 is even.

00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:14.470
It follows every definition.

00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:19.540
In fact, if it wasn't even, then
it would break our rules

00:04:19.540 --> 00:04:22.520
of arithmetic, which would
be a disaster.

00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:27.210
It is true to say that 0 is
neither positive or negative.

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:30.720
It sits here between the
positive numbers and the

00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:31.835
negative numbers.

00:04:31.835 --> 00:04:34.930
So it is neither positive
or negative.

00:04:34.930 --> 00:04:37.890
ROGER BOWLEY: The discovery of
0 was the most important

00:04:37.890 --> 00:04:41.430
advance in mathematics of all,
because it made mathematics

00:04:41.430 --> 00:04:43.470
capable of being understood
by everybody.

00:04:43.470 --> 00:04:45.310
Everybody could do
this mathematics.

00:04:45.310 --> 00:04:47.570
JAMES GRIME: The Babylonians,
the Greeks, they had the idea

00:04:47.570 --> 00:04:49.030
of a space.

00:04:49.030 --> 00:04:51.560
So there was a difference
between 26, 2

00:04:51.560 --> 00:04:55.630
and 6, and 206, 2-0-6.

00:04:55.630 --> 00:04:56.630
They had a space there.

00:04:56.630 --> 00:04:59.340
They didn't use the symbol
0, but they had a space.

00:04:59.340 --> 00:05:01.780
It was more like a
punctuation mark.

00:05:01.780 --> 00:05:04.100
So the Babylonians would
understand the difference

00:05:04.100 --> 00:05:09.810
between 26 and 206.

00:05:09.810 --> 00:05:12.840
But instead of using the symbol
for 0, they would just

00:05:12.840 --> 00:05:14.480
have a space.

00:05:14.480 --> 00:05:19.046
However, if they wanted
to write 260, 260 was

00:05:19.046 --> 00:05:19.980
written like this.

00:05:19.980 --> 00:05:23.030
And to us, that looks like 26.

00:05:23.030 --> 00:05:25.810
To them and in context,
that would make sense.

00:05:25.810 --> 00:05:29.640
But they didn't have this
idea of 0 by itself.

00:05:29.640 --> 00:05:33.000
In the 9th century, the
first instance--

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:36.110
or the first recorded
instance of 0--

00:05:36.110 --> 00:05:36.760
was found.

00:05:36.760 --> 00:05:40.180
It was actually found by a
gardener keeping track of the

00:05:40.180 --> 00:05:42.610
number of flowers that his
garden would produce.

00:05:42.610 --> 00:05:45.500
And he used the number 50 as
we would recognize it.

00:05:45.500 --> 00:05:47.460
5, 0.

00:05:47.460 --> 00:05:50.590
After that point, they started
to experiment with 0.

00:05:50.590 --> 00:05:52.680
What could it do?

00:05:52.680 --> 00:05:55.220
If you add 0, it makes
no difference.

00:05:55.220 --> 00:05:58.670
If you times by 0, you get 0.

00:05:58.670 --> 00:06:00.850
Dividing by 0--

00:06:00.850 --> 00:06:03.960
that caused them some problems
as it still does today.

00:06:03.960 --> 00:06:06.080
ROGER BOWLEY: In this sense,
the mathematical sense, the

00:06:06.080 --> 00:06:08.890
number 0 does not
mean nothing.

00:06:08.890 --> 00:06:11.830
It means a quantity which you
can manipulate in the

00:06:11.830 --> 00:06:12.590
mathematics.

00:06:12.590 --> 00:06:16.310
And so it's better to call
it 0 rather than nothing.

00:06:16.310 --> 00:06:18.050
Nothing is when you're
counting.

00:06:18.050 --> 00:06:19.340
There's nothing there.

00:06:19.340 --> 00:06:22.530
0 is the abstract mathematical
quantity.

00:06:22.530 --> 00:06:25.980
CGP GREY: I'm CGP Grey and
my favorite number is 0.

00:06:25.980 --> 00:06:29.830
I like 0 because it's not
an obvious number.

00:06:29.830 --> 00:06:32.740
You can have counting systems
where there's one thing, two

00:06:32.740 --> 00:06:34.680
things, three things,
four things.

00:06:34.680 --> 00:06:38.560
But mathematics existed for a
long time without having a 0

00:06:38.560 --> 00:06:39.210
as part of it.

00:06:39.210 --> 00:06:42.220
So it's a number, but
it also isn't

00:06:42.220 --> 00:06:43.680
anything in and of itself.
