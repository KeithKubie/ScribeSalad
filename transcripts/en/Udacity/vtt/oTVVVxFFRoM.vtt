00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:03.290
To recap today's lesson, data science is a discipline

00:00:03.290 --> 00:00:06.390
that incorporates methods and expertise from a variety of different

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:10.160
fields, to glean insights from large data sets, and then

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:13.170
use those insights to build data driven products, or to

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:16.590
create action items. There's no cookie cutter way to become

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:19.220
a data scientist, but a lot of data scientists have

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:23.010
a very strong background in mathematics and statistics, and also

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:25.580
have the programming skills to handle these data sets and

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:29.980
also to perform analysis. Currently, data science is most closely

00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:32.560
associated with the tech field, but more and more data

00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:34.660
science is being used all over the world in a

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:37.570
variety of different fields. In order to solve new and

00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:41.920
old problems, more efficiently and effectively. Now I know what

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:45.190
you're thinking. This sounds awesome, data science sounds really cool,

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:46.680
I want to work on a project get me some

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:51.470
data. Unfortunately, data seldom comes in formats that we want.

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:54.150
It might be in a format we've never seen, it might come from a

00:00:54.150 --> 00:00:56.220
weird source. There might be missing or

00:00:56.220 --> 00:00:59.520
erroneous values. Because of this, any data

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:01.350
scientist worth their salt is skilled at

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:03.750
acquiring data. And then massaging it into

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:07.340
a workable format. That's what we're going to be covering in the next lesson.
