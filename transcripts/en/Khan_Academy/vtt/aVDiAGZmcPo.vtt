00:00:00.610 --> 00:00:04.130
Let's do a couple of problems
where we estimate or predict

00:00:04.130 --> 00:00:07.390
answers to questions using
linear models.

00:00:10.270 --> 00:00:12.030
It sounds very fancy.

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:16.550
But what a linear model is is
just using a line to describe

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:19.000
some trend in data.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.490
With our linear models we
will do a little bit of

00:00:21.490 --> 00:00:27.390
interpolation and a little
bit of extrapolation.

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:29.280
You might have already heard
these words before in your

00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:30.530
everyday life.

00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:38.830
Interpolation means trying to
estimate what happened between

00:00:38.830 --> 00:00:39.620
two data points.

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:41.700
We're going to do a couple
of examples of

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:42.890
that in this video.

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:46.680
Extrapolation means we'll see
what the last few data points

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:49.950
were, and see what that trend
would look like, and then keep

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:53.720
on continuing that trend and see
what might happen if that

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:54.950
trend were to continue.

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:57.380
I'll show you some
examples of that.

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:59.990
So let's do some example
questions here.

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:02.050
So I have this chart here.

00:01:02.050 --> 00:01:04.650
Median age, remember median
is the middle.

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:14.310
So if I have the numbers 3, 7,
and 9, the median is the 7.

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:17.390
It's the middle age.

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:21.900
So this is the median age of
males and females at first

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:23.750
marriage by year.

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:26.650
So if we just look at this data
right here, if we look at

00:01:26.650 --> 00:01:31.200
1900, the average man was
getting married, not the

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:32.730
average, the median male.

00:01:32.730 --> 00:01:36.080
So the middle man was getting
married at looks like at

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:40.930
around the age a little over
25, almost 26, while the

00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:47.030
median woman was getting married
looks at around 22 or

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:48.790
23 years old.

00:01:48.790 --> 00:01:51.160
As we went through the century,
those ages got lower,

00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:53.830
and lower, and lower, until
we got to about 1960.

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:55.410
This problem is interesting
irrespective

00:01:55.410 --> 00:01:57.010
of the actual problem.

00:01:57.010 --> 00:02:00.330
It's just interesting to see
this trend that at the

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:03.970
beginning of the century, people
got married reasonably

00:02:03.970 --> 00:02:06.020
similar to when they're getting
married right now.

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:07.950
But there was a minimum point.

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:11.070
Around the 1960s, people got
married at a younger age.

00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:12.870
This was true for males
and females.

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:17.420
You can also see back here the
age difference between the

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:19.400
median male and the
median female.

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:22.370
That's just gotten smaller
and smaller over time.

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:23.580
Now it's really small.

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:24.910
So these are just
all interesting

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:25.820
things from this chart.

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:28.720
This is the actual data
from that chart.

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:30.160
So actually I didn't even have
to estimate it here.

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:36.620
In 1900, the median age of
males getting married was

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:41.570
25.9, that's that right there,
and the median age of women

00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:44.520
getting married was 21.9,
that's that over there.

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:47.060
So this is just a scatter
plot of this data.

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:50.220
We've just plotted each of these
points over here, these

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:52.660
in blue, these in red.

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:55.230
Let's do the questions.

00:02:55.230 --> 00:03:00.020
Use the data from example 1--
this is example 1 up here-- to

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:05.850
estimate the age at marriage
for females in 1946.

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:10.750
Fit a line by hand to the
data before 1970.

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:12.660
So what they want to do, is they
want me to look at all of

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:14.370
the data before 1970.

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:18.200
So let's see, this is
1970 right here.

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:20.460
That's 1970 right there.

00:03:20.460 --> 00:03:26.420
They want to fit a line by hand
to the data before 1970.

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:29.650
What they mean is-- and I'm just
going to eyeball -- but

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:34.830
they want me to draw a line that
gets as close to all of

00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:38.390
this data before 1970
as possible.

00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:40.200
So it can't go through
all of these points.

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:43.680
Because all these points don't
sit exactly on one line.

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:47.710
But let me try to draw a line,
or a linear model, for the

00:03:47.710 --> 00:03:53.040
data from, what is this, 1890
all the way to 1970.

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:57.370
So I'm going to try my best to
draw a line here that gets

00:03:57.370 --> 00:03:59.030
close to all of these points.

00:03:59.030 --> 00:04:01.090
It won't be able to go
through all of them.

00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:04.780
So all the way to 1970, maybe
a line would look

00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:07.310
something like that.

00:04:07.310 --> 00:04:09.296
Let me draw a better
one than that.

00:04:09.296 --> 00:04:11.600
I'll draw it in red because
we're dealing

00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:12.810
with the red data.

00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:15.620
So I want to go all
the way to 1970.

00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:18.130
It would have been nice to
have a line drawing tool.

00:04:18.130 --> 00:04:20.329
Maybe the line might look
something like that.

00:04:20.329 --> 00:04:23.880
There are actual mathematical
ways to figure out the best

00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:25.040
fit line on this.

00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:26.530
We won't go into
that right now.

00:04:26.530 --> 00:04:28.100
That's called linear
regression.

00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:29.130
But I just eyeballed it.

00:04:29.130 --> 00:04:31.930
That line looks like a pretty
good fit for all of that data.

00:04:31.930 --> 00:04:34.810
None of the data is too far
away from that line.

00:04:34.810 --> 00:04:37.960
So that's what they mean by fit
a line by hand to the data

00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:39.330
before 1970.

00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:42.540
This is the data before 1970.

00:04:42.540 --> 00:04:46.080
If we assume that this is a
good linear model for that

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:53.340
data, we can use it to estimate
the age at marriage

00:04:53.340 --> 00:04:57.340
for females in 1946.

00:04:57.340 --> 00:04:59.380
Let's see, this is 1950.

00:04:59.380 --> 00:05:02.200
This would be 1945.

00:05:02.200 --> 00:05:04.060
1945 would be right over here.

00:05:04.060 --> 00:05:07.740
So 1946 would be right
over there.

00:05:07.740 --> 00:05:11.840
So if we wanted to estimate
that, if I were to figure out

00:05:11.840 --> 00:05:15.380
where that hits the vertical
axis, it seems to hit the

00:05:15.380 --> 00:05:22.695
vertical axis at around-- I
don't know, my best to guess

00:05:22.695 --> 00:05:26.015
is, I should have zoomed
in more-- it hits

00:05:26.015 --> 00:05:27.780
it right about there.

00:05:27.780 --> 00:05:31.260
This is 22.5.

00:05:31.260 --> 00:05:34.740
So this looks like maybe 20.5.

00:05:34.740 --> 00:05:38.520
Because this would be
maybe 20.5 years.

00:05:38.520 --> 00:05:41.300
So I'll call it twenty
20.5 years.

00:05:41.300 --> 00:05:43.550
Obviously I can't do it exact,
but you get the idea.

00:05:43.550 --> 00:05:44.800
I am interpolating.

00:05:47.090 --> 00:05:49.510
Here I'm using the
model to do.

00:05:49.510 --> 00:05:51.620
I won't use necessarily the
word interpolation yet.

00:05:51.620 --> 00:05:55.530
We're going to do a much more
direct form of interpolation

00:05:55.530 --> 00:05:56.700
later on in this video.

00:05:56.700 --> 00:06:00.040
But here I fit a line, and then
I just use that line as a

00:06:00.040 --> 00:06:06.425
model to estimate what was the
median age of women in 1946.

00:06:06.425 --> 00:06:08.090
Let's do part 2.

00:06:08.090 --> 00:06:10.890
Use the data from example 1 to
estimate the age of marriage

00:06:10.890 --> 00:06:13.280
for females in 1984.

00:06:13.280 --> 00:06:17.220
Fit a line by hand to the data
from 1970 on in order to

00:06:17.220 --> 00:06:18.700
estimate this accurately.

00:06:18.700 --> 00:06:21.050
So now they want us to fit
a line from the data on.

00:06:21.050 --> 00:06:22.220
So let me make a line.

00:06:22.220 --> 00:06:26.750
So fit a line by hand from
the data 1970 on.

00:06:26.750 --> 00:06:29.340
So let me draw a line that gets
close to all of these

00:06:29.340 --> 00:06:31.680
points, that gets close
to describing

00:06:31.680 --> 00:06:32.470
all of these points.

00:06:32.470 --> 00:06:35.520
Maybe it looks like something
like that.

00:06:35.520 --> 00:06:38.080
Not all of them sit exactly on
the line, but they're all

00:06:38.080 --> 00:06:39.520
pretty close.

00:06:39.520 --> 00:06:42.110
If we assume that this is a
good a linear model-- I

00:06:42.110 --> 00:06:44.970
haven't done this
mathematically, I'm eyeballing

00:06:44.970 --> 00:06:47.660
it-- but let's see what
it would be in 1984.

00:06:47.660 --> 00:06:50.410
This is 1990.

00:06:50.410 --> 00:06:55.540
So 1984 is going to be
right around there.

00:06:58.370 --> 00:07:02.340
Actually it looks amazingly
similar to the median age of

00:07:02.340 --> 00:07:04.340
men in 1970.

00:07:04.340 --> 00:07:06.170
So we can actually get
the exact number.

00:07:06.170 --> 00:07:08.020
It's about 23.2.

00:07:08.020 --> 00:07:14.550
So this looks to be
about 23.2 years.

00:07:14.550 --> 00:07:18.890
Part 3, use the data from
example 1 to estimate the age

00:07:18.890 --> 00:07:21.870
at marriage for males in 1995.

00:07:21.870 --> 00:07:23.160
Use linear interpolation.

00:07:23.160 --> 00:07:25.750
Now we're going to do more
direct form of interpolation.

00:07:25.750 --> 00:07:27.270
We're not going to use a linear
model or we're not

00:07:27.270 --> 00:07:28.220
going to fit a line.

00:07:28.220 --> 00:07:33.600
We're going to use linear
interpolation between 1990 and

00:07:33.600 --> 00:07:35.180
2000 data points.

00:07:35.180 --> 00:07:36.270
We're looking at men now.

00:07:36.270 --> 00:07:37.530
So I'll do it in blue.

00:07:37.530 --> 00:07:43.140
Between 1990, that is 1990
and that is 2000 for men.

00:07:43.140 --> 00:07:46.810
So if I were to draw just a line
there, we could assume

00:07:46.810 --> 00:07:48.650
that the trend would have looked
something like that

00:07:48.650 --> 00:07:51.030
between 1990 and 2000.

00:07:51.030 --> 00:07:54.330
They want us to interpolate
what happened in 1995.

00:07:54.330 --> 00:07:57.280
So 1995 is that point
right there.

00:07:57.280 --> 00:07:59.320
So this is pure interpolation.

00:07:59.320 --> 00:08:01.940
We're using the data point
in 1990 and the

00:08:01.940 --> 00:08:03.225
data point in 2000.

00:08:03.225 --> 00:08:07.340
We're drawing a line between
them and assuming that 1995

00:08:07.340 --> 00:08:08.970
would have been right
in between them.

00:08:08.970 --> 00:08:12.130
We're interpolating between
the 1990 data

00:08:12.130 --> 00:08:13.910
and the 2000 data.

00:08:13.910 --> 00:08:19.150
So if you were to try to
estimate where that is, it

00:08:19.150 --> 00:08:22.710
looks like it's a little
bit over 26.

00:08:22.710 --> 00:08:25.550
Actually if we say that it's
right in between these two

00:08:25.550 --> 00:08:31.900
values right there, it'll
be 26.45 years.

00:08:31.900 --> 00:08:35.330
If it's exactly in between,
1995 is exactly

00:08:35.330 --> 00:08:36.600
5 years from each.

00:08:36.600 --> 00:08:40.080
So 26.45 looks pretty good.

00:08:40.080 --> 00:08:44.010
So let's do another example So
here's a percentage of women

00:08:44.010 --> 00:08:45.160
smokers by year.

00:08:45.160 --> 00:08:47.580
I have to say these charts
are interesting in and of

00:08:47.580 --> 00:08:48.510
themselves.

00:08:48.510 --> 00:08:52.420
You'll notice in 1990 there were
a good number of women

00:08:52.420 --> 00:08:54.660
who were pregnant who smoked.

00:08:54.660 --> 00:09:00.270
Almost 18% or 19% of pregnant
women smoked in 1990.

00:09:00.270 --> 00:09:01.050
Now that's down.

00:09:01.050 --> 00:09:05.070
Well this is 2004 so hopefully
this trend is continuing to go

00:09:05.070 --> 00:09:06.710
down eventually to 0%.

00:09:06.710 --> 00:09:08.090
But it went down to 10%.

00:09:08.090 --> 00:09:11.060
So there still are a percentage
of pregnant women

00:09:11.060 --> 00:09:14.870
who unfortunately smoke.

00:09:14.870 --> 00:09:17.260
Let's do these problems. Use
the data from example 2--

00:09:17.260 --> 00:09:19.870
that's this right here-- to
estimate the percentage of

00:09:19.870 --> 00:09:22.130
pregnant smokers in 1997.

00:09:22.130 --> 00:09:23.790
Use linear interpolation
between the

00:09:23.790 --> 00:09:28.650
1996 and 2000 data.

00:09:28.650 --> 00:09:30.850
We're going to use linear
interpolation.

00:09:30.850 --> 00:09:34.220
So let me draw a line.

00:09:34.220 --> 00:09:36.820
You could always do this much
more exact if you have better

00:09:36.820 --> 00:09:37.950
tools or a spreadsheet.

00:09:37.950 --> 00:09:47.480
But I'm going to draw a line,
and I want to get 1997.

00:09:47.480 --> 00:09:48.530
This is 1997.

00:09:48.530 --> 00:09:51.350
It's going to be right
over there.

00:09:51.350 --> 00:09:53.220
If we use linear interpolation,
we are

00:09:53.220 --> 00:09:54.620
interpolating between
that data point

00:09:54.620 --> 00:09:55.500
and that data point.

00:09:55.500 --> 00:09:56.355
It's a linear interpolation.

00:09:56.355 --> 00:09:59.530
We assume It's a linear
trend between the two.

00:09:59.530 --> 00:10:04.700
So this looks like it's-- let me
go all the way over here--

00:10:04.700 --> 00:10:06.850
looks a little bit more
than 12, maybe

00:10:06.850 --> 00:10:11.810
13% is my best estimate.

00:10:11.810 --> 00:10:13.260
Now part 5.

00:10:13.260 --> 00:10:16.060
Use the data from example 2--
same example right here-- to

00:10:16.060 --> 00:10:21.030
estimate the percentage of
pregnant smokers in 2006.

00:10:21.030 --> 00:10:22.450
There isn't any 2006.

00:10:22.450 --> 00:10:24.290
This chart ends at 2004.

00:10:24.290 --> 00:10:28.440
So we have to use linear
extrapolation with the final

00:10:28.440 --> 00:10:29.190
two data points.

00:10:29.190 --> 00:10:30.580
So this here you're going to
see the difference between

00:10:30.580 --> 00:10:32.520
interpolation and
extrapolation.

00:10:32.520 --> 00:10:35.050
Interpolation, you are
estimating between two data

00:10:35.050 --> 00:10:36.290
points you already knew.

00:10:36.290 --> 00:10:40.300
Extrapolation, we're going to
take the final two data points

00:10:40.300 --> 00:10:41.790
and we're going to continue
that line.

00:10:41.790 --> 00:10:43.610
We're going to extrapolate
that line.

00:10:43.610 --> 00:10:45.990
So if you were to just continue
this line between the

00:10:45.990 --> 00:10:47.400
final two data points,
it might look

00:10:47.400 --> 00:10:48.830
something like that.

00:10:48.830 --> 00:10:52.300
So if you had 2006 out here--
these are going up by two, so

00:10:52.300 --> 00:10:59.830
2004, 2006-- we extrapolate
this line.

00:10:59.830 --> 00:11:03.020
The percentage of women smoking
might be, well it

00:11:03.020 --> 00:11:07.160
looks a little bit under 10%.

00:11:07.160 --> 00:11:09.980
So maybe 9.5%.

00:11:09.980 --> 00:11:11.520
Once again, it's just
an estimate.

00:11:11.520 --> 00:11:13.290
But we're just extrapolating
the trend.

00:11:13.290 --> 00:11:15.000
We're assuming the
trend of the last

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:16.660
two data points continues.

00:11:16.660 --> 00:11:20.370
Then using that, it would
be around 9.5% in 2006.

00:11:20.370 --> 00:11:24.300
Now maybe, that's not definitely
the only prediction

00:11:24.300 --> 00:11:24.730
you could make.

00:11:24.730 --> 00:11:28.390
You could extrapolate based on
all of the data and get a line

00:11:28.390 --> 00:11:31.010
that looks something-- let me
try to do it a little bit

00:11:31.010 --> 00:11:35.060
better than that-- that looks
something like that.

00:11:35.060 --> 00:11:37.620
Then this line would predict
a lower smoking rate.

00:11:37.620 --> 00:11:40.080
So it depends on what data you
use, what you're using to do

00:11:40.080 --> 00:11:42.760
your linear model with, and
how you're extrapolating.

00:11:42.760 --> 00:11:45.580
But anyway, hopefully you
found this useful.
