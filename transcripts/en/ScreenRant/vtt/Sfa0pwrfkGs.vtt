00:00:03.370 --> 00:00:07.660
Fourteen years after Disney Pixar released
their 2004 animated film, The Incredibles

00:00:07.660 --> 00:00:10.809
they will be releasing a sequel about the
family with superpowers.

00:00:10.809 --> 00:00:14.500
The plot is kept under wraps and there is
much speculation as to what the plot will

00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:15.500
be.

00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:19.540
With speculation comes theories and there
is one theory that focuses on the petite fashion

00:00:19.540 --> 00:00:21.410
designer, Edna Mode’s past.

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:25.770
The popular theory suggests that Edna is a
reformed supervillain and the reasons this

00:00:25.770 --> 00:00:29.369
theory is in speculation are not only fun
but intriguing.

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:36.810

00:00:36.810 --> 00:00:47.660
Here is Screen Rant’s look into an 'Incredibles'
Theory That Pixar Might Be Hiding From Us.

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:48.870
Villainous Facility

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:54.359
Her home or dare we say liar looked oddly
similar to a villain’s home in a James Bond

00:00:54.359 --> 00:00:55.620
film.

00:00:55.620 --> 00:01:01.030
Her entrance gate has lasers instead of bars
and when her security system thought Elastigirl

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:05.070
was not invited they almost took her out.

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:08.240
Then when she showed Elastigirl her design
for Jack-Jack’s outfit she tested the durability

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:10.460
with flamethrowers and automatic weapons.

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:14.870
Now, we know many of you would love to have
those installed in your house but you have

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:22.540
to admit it’s from your villainous side.

00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:23.870
Love for Danger

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:27.770
In scenes of The Incredibles Edna showed a
love for danger and she missed seeing her

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:29.360
superhero clients working.

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:33.250
When they were working there was a sense of
danger and she enjoyed every minute of it.

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:38.390
She longed for the old days but more importantly
she wasn’t afraid to get feisty with superheroes.

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:43.880
She didn’t back down from them and pushed
them to do her will.

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:47.530
These are characters that could crush her
in a moment and that is probably why she confronted

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:50.640
them.

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:52.730
Contempt for Her Guards

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:56.450
Her guards seemed to get on her nerves, almost
as if she didn’t want them to be there.

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:59.430
Are her guards put there by the government
to ensure she doesn’t come up with any new

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:02.060
technological advances that could hurt the
country?

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:05.380
What if they are put there to guard her like
the superheroes are being looked over.

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:09.140
Why are these guards living with her and no
one else and why would a simple designer even

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:10.200
need guards?

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:13.110
Think about the Emperor’s Guards in Star
Wars, do you ever see Luke Skywalker with

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:15.290
a guard or how about his costume designer?

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:17.609
What have you been up to Edna?

00:02:17.609 --> 00:02:19.799
Jack-Jack’s Outfit

00:02:19.799 --> 00:02:23.709
Edna designed an outfit for Jack-Jack with
all of the bells and whistles claiming that

00:02:23.709 --> 00:02:27.340
she gave him all of those retardants because
she didn’t know his powers yet.

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:31.240
How did she know he would need to be able
to withstand 1000 degrees of heat?

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:36.040
She seemed very certain that he had superhero
powers when his mother, who raised him, didn’t

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:37.090
even know he had them.

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:42.329
Luckily she did see into the future because
Jack-Jack did have a use for that new outfit.

00:02:42.329 --> 00:02:46.019
A Villain’s Mind

00:02:46.019 --> 00:02:49.920
Even if Edna didn’t know Jack-Jack would
have superpowers she prepared an outfit for

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:52.439
him to be protected when Syndrome goes after
him.

00:02:52.439 --> 00:02:55.969
She knew how a villain thought and was one
step ahead of him.

00:02:55.969 --> 00:02:59.719
Villains are prone to disliking boredom and
so is Edna, she wanted the thrill again and

00:02:59.719 --> 00:03:02.319
mentioned her need for a thrill many times.

00:03:02.319 --> 00:03:08.500
Remember she used to design for Gods and supermodels
bore her.

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:09.659
Dressed to Kill

00:03:09.659 --> 00:03:13.129
Edna was dressed like a villain, look at her
outfit and compare it to villains in other

00:03:13.129 --> 00:03:14.310
Disney films.

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:18.469
Lined up next to Cruella de Vil or Maleficent
you can see where she could get her inspiration

00:03:18.469 --> 00:03:19.469
from them.

00:03:19.469 --> 00:03:22.989
Maybe she designed her clothes after watching
a Disney movie or after a meeting with fellow

00:03:22.989 --> 00:03:24.189
Disney villains.

00:03:24.189 --> 00:03:25.959
That would be an interesting meeting to be
a part of.

00:03:25.959 --> 00:03:27.840
What do you think about the theory on Edna?

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:31.639
Is Edna Mode a former villain turned good
guy who started to design superhero outfits

00:03:31.639 --> 00:03:33.499
to atone for her evil ways?

00:03:33.499 --> 00:03:37.090
If she is a reformed supervillain we hope
those glasses have special powers and we get

00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:38.209
to see them in the sequel.

00:03:38.209 --> 00:03:45.859
There you have it an 'Incredibles' Theory
That Pixar Might Be Hiding From Us.
