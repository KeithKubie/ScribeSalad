[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:05.522 --> 00:00:07.730
DANIEL ALEGRE: Ladies and
gentlemen, Secretary Perez.

00:00:07.730 --> 00:00:09.122
Please welcome hm.

00:00:09.122 --> 00:00:12.340
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:13.380
THOMAS PEREZ: Thank you, Daniel.

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:14.270
DANIEL ALEGRE: Thank
you for coming.

00:00:14.270 --> 00:00:15.550
THOMAS PEREZ: Buenas tardes.

00:00:15.550 --> 00:00:15.890
DANIEL ALEGRE: Beunas tardes.

00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:17.056
THOMAS PEREZ: Beunas tardes.

00:00:20.157 --> 00:00:21.740
DANIEL ALEGRE: Buffalo
Bills-- I don't

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:23.406
think we're here to
talk about football,

00:00:23.406 --> 00:00:25.690
but why your affinity
for the Buffalo Bills?

00:00:25.690 --> 00:00:27.148
THOMAS PEREZ: I
grew up in Buffalo.

00:00:27.148 --> 00:00:28.630
I'm a Buffalo-minican.

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:33.880
My parents got to Buffalo
because of the similarities

00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:37.630
in the weather between
DR and Buffalo.

00:00:37.630 --> 00:00:41.800
Actually, they had to leave
the Dominican Republic,

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:44.430
because there was a
pretty bad dictator there,

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:49.400
and my father went into
the US Army, served

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:53.930
as a legal immigrant,
and so when he got out,

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:55.960
he was stationed in
Atlanta, Georgia.

00:00:55.960 --> 00:01:00.290
And by then, three of
the five of us were born.

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:02.560
He got a job at the VA
Hospital in Buffalo,

00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:04.030
and that's where he moved.

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:05.870
And so my sister and
I were born there.

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:08.340
So I'm the caboose of five,
and they settled there,

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:10.030
and Buffalo is a great town.

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:14.020
We were the Dominican Chamber
of Commerce when I was a kid.

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:17.180
There were three Dominican
families, actually.

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:18.410
Now there are many more.

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:22.520
But at the time, there
were just three families.

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:25.210
DANIEL ALEGRE: And I think a lot
of Hispanics here in the United

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:26.880
States have similar stories.

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:32.900
I grew up in Mexico, and
then we emigrated to Toronto,

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:35.610
and we were one of three
Mexican families in Toronto.

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:38.430
But I remember
watching the news.

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:40.570
The only American news
we would get in Canada

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:43.570
would be the Buffalo
news, and whenever

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:46.010
it would snow an
inch in Toronto,

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:48.130
it would snow 10
feet in Buffalo.

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:49.725
So I felt for the
poor Dominicans

00:01:49.725 --> 00:01:51.800
who were freezing out there.

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:54.170
THOMAS PEREZ: It's a
great place to grow up.

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:55.545
DANIEL ALEGRE: If
you don't mind,

00:01:55.545 --> 00:01:58.007
I'd like to talk a little bit
about your family background.

00:01:58.007 --> 00:02:00.340
You mentioned your family's
from the Dominican Republic.

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:02.662
I believe your grandfather
was involved in politics.

00:02:02.662 --> 00:02:03.453
THOMAS PEREZ: Yeah.

00:02:03.453 --> 00:02:05.869
DANIEL ALEGRE: Can you talk a
little bit about that story?

00:02:05.869 --> 00:02:08.630
THOMAS PEREZ: My grandfather
was in the diplomatic service

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:11.590
there starting in
the early 1920s.

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:17.710
And then when Trujillo came to
power around the early '30s,

00:02:17.710 --> 00:02:22.490
he became the ambassador
to the United States.

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:27.730
And then in 1935,
at first, Trujillo

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:29.520
was trained by
the United States,

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:32.500
so when he came to
power, there was a hope

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:36.900
that maybe some of that
training would provide him

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:39.290
with a sense of values.

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:41.380
And it turned out
not to be the case.

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:48.410
So by '35, my
grandfather spoke out.

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:55.320
He was removed from his
job, and then in '37

00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:58.150
after the massacre
of the Haitians,

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:00.580
he had already been
removed from his job,

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:07.050
but then he was kind of formally
declared non-grata by Trujillo.

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:11.260
So my family moved
to New York City.

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:14.510
My mom lived most of
her life in the States,

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:18.140
even though she was
born in Santo Domingo.

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:20.690
So it was basically the
height of the Depression,

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:22.740
and my mom was the
second youngest of nine,

00:03:22.740 --> 00:03:24.550
and they were in the States.

00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:27.690
And that's how our
love for this country

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:33.920
came about, because this country
gave my family opportunity.

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:38.470
And so it was-- they
grew up in Mecca

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:41.420
for most Dominicans
is Washington Heights,

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:43.670
so that's where they grew up.

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:47.510
My father left as
well, because he

00:03:47.510 --> 00:03:51.380
was part of sort of
a student movement,

00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:53.060
for lack of a better term.

00:03:53.060 --> 00:03:55.840
And so he left the
Dominican Republic,

00:03:55.840 --> 00:04:00.970
and they met, got married, and
settled ultimately in Buffalo,

00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:01.890
as I described.

00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:03.850
And so you learn
a lot of lessons

00:04:03.850 --> 00:04:08.390
from that, including make sure
the ladder's down for others.

00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:11.670
DANIEL ALEGRE: What was
it like being one of three

00:04:11.670 --> 00:04:13.250
Dominican families in Buffalo?

00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:15.196
Was there a big
Hispanic community,

00:04:15.196 --> 00:04:17.320
or was it essentially the
three Dominican families?

00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:21.142
THOMAS PEREZ: No, there
was not a large community

00:04:21.142 --> 00:04:22.350
at all when I was growing up.

00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:26.730
I was actually back
there in Buffalo eight

00:04:26.730 --> 00:04:29.290
or nine months ago doing
some work on a weekend,

00:04:29.290 --> 00:04:33.610
and I was at a
restaurant at an event,

00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:36.950
and it was just remarkable
how the community has grown,

00:04:36.950 --> 00:04:39.121
not just the Dominican
community, but the Latino

00:04:39.121 --> 00:04:39.620
community.

00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:44.990
A lot of Puerto Ricans,
more Dominicans,

00:04:44.990 --> 00:04:49.250
and frankly, it's very
affordable to live in Buffalo.

00:04:49.250 --> 00:04:55.270
And so you look at places like
Bucks County, Pennsylvania,

00:04:55.270 --> 00:04:58.090
which is about maybe three
hours from New York City,

00:04:58.090 --> 00:05:01.674
and you see this immense Puerto
Rican and Dominican community.

00:05:01.674 --> 00:05:03.090
And basically,
they were folks who

00:05:03.090 --> 00:05:05.890
settled in New York, got priced
out of the New York market.

00:05:05.890 --> 00:05:11.030
You can have a $14, $15 an
hour job in that community

00:05:11.030 --> 00:05:15.760
and own a home and live a
really solid middle class life.

00:05:15.760 --> 00:05:19.360
So you see in these communities
that have sprouted up.

00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:22.330
Reading, Pennsylvania
is 70% Latino.

00:05:22.330 --> 00:05:27.550
I mean it's remarkable how
immigration patterns have

00:05:27.550 --> 00:05:29.980
transformed communities,
urban, suburban,

00:05:29.980 --> 00:05:34.160
and rural, across the country,
and Buffalo is no different.

00:05:34.160 --> 00:05:36.850
So I no longer need my hands.

00:05:36.850 --> 00:05:39.630
I need much more than my hands
to count the number of Latino

00:05:39.630 --> 00:05:41.999
families in Western New York.

00:05:41.999 --> 00:05:44.290
DANIEL ALEGRE: Now it's
obviously not a job description

00:05:44.290 --> 00:05:49.360
to be of Hispanic heritage
to be the Secretary of Labor,

00:05:49.360 --> 00:05:53.470
but what do you think
your background,

00:05:53.470 --> 00:05:55.590
how your family came here
to the United States,

00:05:55.590 --> 00:05:57.800
how has that
influenced you in terms

00:05:57.800 --> 00:06:02.280
of your thinking about your
job as a Secretary of Labor

00:06:02.280 --> 00:06:06.720
with the definition that I
had of Americans' livelihood?

00:06:06.720 --> 00:06:08.360
THOMAS PEREZ: Well,
my parents taught

00:06:08.360 --> 00:06:12.280
all five of us that to whom
much is given, much is expected.

00:06:12.280 --> 00:06:15.357
And so actually, all of
my siblings are doctors,

00:06:15.357 --> 00:06:16.940
and I'm the black
sheep of the family.

00:06:16.940 --> 00:06:19.523
And I had to promise never to
be a plaintiff's personal injury

00:06:19.523 --> 00:06:23.040
lawyer, and I kept that promise.

00:06:23.040 --> 00:06:29.130
And what I love about
my job is that it really

00:06:29.130 --> 00:06:31.520
is consistent with the
values that I was taught,

00:06:31.520 --> 00:06:34.440
which are the values
of making sure

00:06:34.440 --> 00:06:36.730
there's a level playing
field for everyone.

00:06:36.730 --> 00:06:39.700
And the thing I love about my
job at the Department of Labor

00:06:39.700 --> 00:06:42.190
is we help people at scale.

00:06:42.190 --> 00:06:46.930
I've worked with so many
different businesses, who

00:06:46.930 --> 00:06:52.970
understand that when workers
succeed and businesses succeed,

00:06:52.970 --> 00:06:53.595
we all succeed.

00:06:56.170 --> 00:06:59.580
I've been very involved in this
conscious capitalism movement,

00:06:59.580 --> 00:07:02.080
which is really a movement of
a lot of business leaders, who

00:07:02.080 --> 00:07:04.780
understand that when
you have a stakeholder

00:07:04.780 --> 00:07:06.680
model of governance--
in other words,

00:07:06.680 --> 00:07:10.610
shareholders are best served
when all stakeholders are

00:07:10.610 --> 00:07:11.620
well-served.

00:07:11.620 --> 00:07:13.930
It's not I either take
care of my workers,

00:07:13.930 --> 00:07:15.950
or I take care of
my customer, or I

00:07:15.950 --> 00:07:20.180
take care of my shareholder, or
I take care of my supply chain.

00:07:20.180 --> 00:07:23.540
You can create a virtuous cycle,
and there are so many employers

00:07:23.540 --> 00:07:24.400
who are doing that.

00:07:24.400 --> 00:07:25.899
And I spent a lot
of time with them,

00:07:25.899 --> 00:07:30.150
and we spent a lot of
time bringing together

00:07:30.150 --> 00:07:33.410
people who work to ensure
that workers have a voice,

00:07:33.410 --> 00:07:37.380
with employers who understand
that when workers have a voice,

00:07:37.380 --> 00:07:40.710
that's good for workers,
good for business,

00:07:40.710 --> 00:07:41.730
good for communities.

00:07:41.730 --> 00:07:45.670
So it's been a
remarkably fun job.

00:07:45.670 --> 00:07:47.524
I feel like I'm getting
an MBA on the job.

00:07:47.524 --> 00:07:48.940
DANIEL ALEGRE:
Yeah, that's great.

00:07:48.940 --> 00:07:51.012
THOMAS PEREZ: And
that's exciting.

00:07:51.012 --> 00:07:52.470
DANIEL ALEGRE: I
think the question

00:07:52.470 --> 00:07:56.250
of who is a shareholder
has come up many times

00:07:56.250 --> 00:07:58.340
during this election.

00:07:58.340 --> 00:08:01.690
Are illegal immigrants
considered a shareholder

00:08:01.690 --> 00:08:03.606
in this economy or not?

00:08:03.606 --> 00:08:04.480
How do you view that?

00:08:04.480 --> 00:08:08.710
How do you view the--
obviously, the discussion

00:08:08.710 --> 00:08:10.600
that's happening
during the campaign,

00:08:10.600 --> 00:08:13.580
but more specifically,
who do you represent

00:08:13.580 --> 00:08:15.187
as Secretary of Labor?

00:08:15.187 --> 00:08:16.270
Who are your shareholders?

00:08:16.270 --> 00:08:17.894
THOMAS PEREZ: Well,
we enforce a number

00:08:17.894 --> 00:08:21.280
of laws that are really at
the heart of what it means

00:08:21.280 --> 00:08:25.070
to be a worker in
America and what it means

00:08:25.070 --> 00:08:26.910
to be middle class in America.

00:08:26.910 --> 00:08:29.440
The Fair Labor Standards
Act, for instance,

00:08:29.440 --> 00:08:35.770
was, in the words of FDR, the
second most important piece

00:08:35.770 --> 00:08:38.590
of legislation after the
Social Security Act ever

00:08:38.590 --> 00:08:40.929
passed to help workers.

00:08:40.929 --> 00:08:45.660
And the Fair Labor
Standards Act doesn't say,

00:08:45.660 --> 00:08:48.504
you have to help all Americans.

00:08:48.504 --> 00:08:49.920
The Fair Labor
Standards Act says,

00:08:49.920 --> 00:08:54.072
if you worked eight hours, you
should be paid for eight hours.

00:08:54.072 --> 00:08:55.530
At the Civil Rights
Division, where

00:08:55.530 --> 00:08:59.970
I was before the
Department of Labor,

00:08:59.970 --> 00:09:01.410
we enforced a number of laws.

00:09:01.410 --> 00:09:05.780
If you were the victim
of a hate crime,

00:09:05.780 --> 00:09:10.240
or if you were the victim of
an act of police misconduct,

00:09:10.240 --> 00:09:14.730
it didn't matter what your
citizenship or immigration

00:09:14.730 --> 00:09:16.510
status was.

00:09:16.510 --> 00:09:20.210
And that's because that
really fundamentally reflects

00:09:20.210 --> 00:09:23.160
the values of who
we are as a nation.

00:09:23.160 --> 00:09:26.780
And we're having a
serious conversation

00:09:26.780 --> 00:09:30.326
right now about whether
e pluribus unum still

00:09:30.326 --> 00:09:31.450
has meaning in our country.

00:09:31.450 --> 00:09:35.480
I think our diversity is our
greatest strength as a nation.

00:09:35.480 --> 00:09:38.980
Our diversity is what has
made us a great nation,

00:09:38.980 --> 00:09:43.034
and our immigrants
enrich our nation.

00:09:43.034 --> 00:09:44.700
When I was the Maryland
labor secretary,

00:09:44.700 --> 00:09:49.370
we commissioned a study to
document the contributions

00:09:49.370 --> 00:09:51.900
that foreign-born
Marylanders make.

00:09:51.900 --> 00:09:55.230
And foreign-born Marylanders
are more likely in Maryland

00:09:55.230 --> 00:09:58.290
to have a college degree
than native-born Marylanders.

00:09:58.290 --> 00:10:01.880
And our health profession
in Maryland and frankly

00:10:01.880 --> 00:10:06.570
across America would
be in much worse shape,

00:10:06.570 --> 00:10:10.220
but for the contributions of
immigrants, who are working

00:10:10.220 --> 00:10:11.910
in the health profession.

00:10:11.910 --> 00:10:17.170
So I believe that
our immigrant history

00:10:17.170 --> 00:10:21.120
is such a remarkable part
of the American fabric.

00:10:21.120 --> 00:10:25.600
And this isn't the first
time in our nation's history

00:10:25.600 --> 00:10:28.060
that we've had this debate.

00:10:28.060 --> 00:10:30.440
Those of you who study the
know-nothing movement, that

00:10:30.440 --> 00:10:33.780
was an anti-immigrant,
anti-Catholic movement,

00:10:33.780 --> 00:10:40.030
and that movement faded
because of the same reason

00:10:40.030 --> 00:10:41.880
that these movements
today will fade.

00:10:41.880 --> 00:10:45.790
It's because the collective
power of we came together,

00:10:45.790 --> 00:10:49.050
and folks were able to
summon our better angels.

00:10:49.050 --> 00:10:49.800
And I'm confident.

00:10:49.800 --> 00:10:51.790
I have chronic
optimism, because I

00:10:51.790 --> 00:10:56.050
see workers and businesses
and other stakeholders

00:10:56.050 --> 00:10:59.940
working together day in and day
out understanding that we all

00:10:59.940 --> 00:11:01.710
succeed only when
we all succeed.

00:11:01.710 --> 00:11:02.600
DANIEL ALEGRE: Right.

00:11:02.600 --> 00:11:06.260
Well, I'm going to continue
asking a few questions,

00:11:06.260 --> 00:11:09.380
but we'll leave time
for any questions.

00:11:09.380 --> 00:11:11.681
If you feel just impassioned
that you really want

00:11:11.681 --> 00:11:14.180
to interrupt and ask a question
now, please lift your hands,

00:11:14.180 --> 00:11:18.750
and obviously, we'll
be able to answer.

00:11:18.750 --> 00:11:21.340
Just going back again
to your history,

00:11:21.340 --> 00:11:24.740
how did you end up in civil
rights and a civil rights

00:11:24.740 --> 00:11:25.240
attorney?

00:11:25.240 --> 00:11:27.449
What led you to that field?

00:11:27.449 --> 00:11:29.490
THOMAS PEREZ: Well, I
wanted to change the world.

00:11:29.490 --> 00:11:31.220
I looked around, and
I was looking at,

00:11:31.220 --> 00:11:34.240
who are some of the
change agents around?

00:11:34.240 --> 00:11:37.330
And they seemed to be a
lot of people involved

00:11:37.330 --> 00:11:39.100
in the civil rights space.

00:11:39.100 --> 00:11:45.140
And I have a portrait in my
office, a picture of myself

00:11:45.140 --> 00:11:46.840
with John Lewis, who's
one of my heroes,

00:11:46.840 --> 00:11:49.690
along with another
photo with myself

00:11:49.690 --> 00:11:51.890
and Senator Kennedy,
for whom I worked.

00:11:51.890 --> 00:11:56.020
And these were
folks who understood

00:11:56.020 --> 00:11:57.830
what Hubert Humphrey
once said when

00:11:57.830 --> 00:12:00.270
he said that the moral test
of our strength as a nation

00:12:00.270 --> 00:12:04.330
is how we treat those in the
dawn of life, our children,

00:12:04.330 --> 00:12:07.610
how we treat those in the
twilight of life, our seniors,

00:12:07.610 --> 00:12:09.850
and how we treat those
in the shadows of life.

00:12:09.850 --> 00:12:13.340
And I've derived
incredible fulfillment

00:12:13.340 --> 00:12:16.100
from a career in
which we've been

00:12:16.100 --> 00:12:19.770
able to expand opportunity,
and both economic opportunity

00:12:19.770 --> 00:12:23.820
an opportunity to participate
in the democratic process.

00:12:23.820 --> 00:12:27.270
And we have to fortify
our infrastructure

00:12:27.270 --> 00:12:28.800
of economic
opportunity, and we have

00:12:28.800 --> 00:12:31.000
to fortify our
infrastructure of democracy.

00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:33.760
So I feel-- no disrespect
to Lou Gehrig--

00:12:33.760 --> 00:12:35.850
I feel kind of like
the luckiest person

00:12:35.850 --> 00:12:37.880
on the face of the
Earth, because I've

00:12:37.880 --> 00:12:41.110
had these opportunities both
in local, federal, state

00:12:41.110 --> 00:12:45.420
government to help
people at scale.

00:12:45.420 --> 00:12:48.840
DANIEL ALEGRE: The National
Hispanic Heritage Month,

00:12:48.840 --> 00:12:52.070
I guess, was originally the
National Hispanic Heritage

00:12:52.070 --> 00:12:56.120
Week enacted during the
time of Lyndon Johnson,

00:12:56.120 --> 00:12:59.387
then got expanded to
a month during Reagan.

00:12:59.387 --> 00:13:01.970
When do you think it's going be
the National Hispanic Heritage

00:13:01.970 --> 00:13:02.670
Year?

00:13:02.670 --> 00:13:04.000
When is that legislation
going to pass?

00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:06.000
THOMAS PEREZ: Well, I've
said a number of times,

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:10.050
we need to make every day
Martin Luther King Day.

00:13:10.050 --> 00:13:12.560
So I'm always ambivalent
about celebrating months,

00:13:12.560 --> 00:13:16.330
but I do think it's
great to call attention

00:13:16.330 --> 00:13:18.580
to the remarkable
contributions of.

00:13:18.580 --> 00:13:25.180
Latinos I'm going to be
hosting an event this week

00:13:25.180 --> 00:13:27.860
at the Department of
Labor very similar to this

00:13:27.860 --> 00:13:32.012
with the President of
the United Farm Workers,

00:13:32.012 --> 00:13:37.060
Arturo Rodriguez, whose
father-in-law was Cesar Chavez.

00:13:37.060 --> 00:13:41.620
And so we're using that as
an opportunity to talk about

00:13:41.620 --> 00:13:44.270
where we've been, where we've
come, and where we need to go.

00:13:44.270 --> 00:13:47.410
And I think these moments
are good reflections

00:13:47.410 --> 00:13:53.430
and to look at the remarkable
contributions of Latinos

00:13:53.430 --> 00:13:55.590
and to hold events so
that other people who

00:13:55.590 --> 00:14:00.140
are out there wondering, is
Google a place that I can

00:14:00.140 --> 00:14:02.860
aspire to, or is the
Department of Labor

00:14:02.860 --> 00:14:05.540
a place I can aspire to?

00:14:05.540 --> 00:14:09.810
Sandra Day O'Connor once said
in a very important opinion

00:14:09.810 --> 00:14:13.600
on affirmative action,
people across the country

00:14:13.600 --> 00:14:16.660
need to see that
pathways to leadership

00:14:16.660 --> 00:14:19.670
are visibly
available, and if they

00:14:19.670 --> 00:14:21.710
don't see people
who look like them,

00:14:21.710 --> 00:14:24.360
then those pathways
don't look very visible.

00:14:24.360 --> 00:14:27.290
So I think months like
this are pretty important.

00:14:27.290 --> 00:14:28.415
DANIEL ALEGRE: And I agree.

00:14:28.415 --> 00:14:32.879
We had every Thursday,
it's called TGIF, thank god

00:14:32.879 --> 00:14:34.670
it's, I guess it should
be called Thursday,

00:14:34.670 --> 00:14:35.820
but Thank Good it's Friday.

00:14:35.820 --> 00:14:36.800
THOMAS PEREZ: To get--

00:14:36.800 --> 00:14:41.610
DANIEL ALEGRE: To get to Friday,
a celebration of Hispanics

00:14:41.610 --> 00:14:42.340
at Google.

00:14:42.340 --> 00:14:44.360
And one of the things,
the feedback that we

00:14:44.360 --> 00:14:46.810
got from Googlers
all around actually

00:14:46.810 --> 00:14:48.450
was great to even
just talk about it,

00:14:48.450 --> 00:14:50.940
because it gave
Hispanics within Google

00:14:50.940 --> 00:14:52.480
a feeling that
they could belong,

00:14:52.480 --> 00:14:55.280
and they could actually
be part of a community.

00:14:55.280 --> 00:14:59.410
How important is that to you
in your role as a Hispanic,

00:14:59.410 --> 00:15:04.600
as a very prominent Hispanic
in the Obama administration?

00:15:04.600 --> 00:15:08.890
Does that carry a lot of
burden for you as a role model?

00:15:08.890 --> 00:15:10.151
How does that impact you?

00:15:10.151 --> 00:15:12.150
THOMAS PEREZ: I don't see
it as a burden at all.

00:15:12.150 --> 00:15:15.410
I see it as a privilege
and a responsibility.

00:15:15.410 --> 00:15:18.970
So this Thursday, when
we're doing this event

00:15:18.970 --> 00:15:20.390
at the Department
of Labor, we're

00:15:20.390 --> 00:15:25.910
going to have roughly 40
students from my son's

00:15:25.910 --> 00:15:27.280
high school.

00:15:27.280 --> 00:15:32.560
They're all Latino
students, and they're all

00:15:32.560 --> 00:15:37.240
living in some economically
challenging circumstances.

00:15:37.240 --> 00:15:38.930
And one of the
things I've observed

00:15:38.930 --> 00:15:40.596
in the course of the
work that I've done

00:15:40.596 --> 00:15:45.160
is that a lot of
people who haven't

00:15:45.160 --> 00:15:48.040
had the good fortune that
I've had, one of the things

00:15:48.040 --> 00:15:52.090
that they lack is mentors.

00:15:52.090 --> 00:15:55.210
Some people call
it social capital.

00:15:55.210 --> 00:15:58.860
People older than 50
call it a Rolodex.

00:15:58.860 --> 00:16:03.600
People like you all don't
know what a Rolodex is.

00:16:03.600 --> 00:16:06.790
And if you want to be a
nurse, but you've never

00:16:06.790 --> 00:16:11.900
met someone who's a nurse, it's
hard to carry that aspiration.

00:16:11.900 --> 00:16:17.530
And so we're bringing
these students

00:16:17.530 --> 00:16:20.930
so that they can see what
the Department of Labor

00:16:20.930 --> 00:16:25.160
is, so that they can meet
an iconic figure like Artie.

00:16:25.160 --> 00:16:27.920
And then afterward,
we can talk about some

00:16:27.920 --> 00:16:29.790
of the other
opportunities that exist.

00:16:29.790 --> 00:16:33.420
For instance, we were on the job
corps, which the job corps is--

00:16:33.420 --> 00:16:36.780
we just celebrated our 50th
anniversary a couple of years

00:16:36.780 --> 00:16:37.280
ago.

00:16:37.280 --> 00:16:39.030
It's a great
society program that

00:16:39.030 --> 00:16:43.330
has helped literally tens
of thousands of people,

00:16:43.330 --> 00:16:47.820
whose life path was
not linear, but who

00:16:47.820 --> 00:16:51.980
have as much talent as folks
who follow the linear path.

00:16:51.980 --> 00:16:54.350
It helped them to get
access to opportunity.

00:16:54.350 --> 00:16:58.780
And so the more you can do that,
then the greater the likelihood

00:16:58.780 --> 00:17:02.950
that folks who have talent
can harness that talent.

00:17:02.950 --> 00:17:05.900
DANIEL ALEGRE: And again,
any questions, please

00:17:05.900 --> 00:17:09.579
line up at the microphone.

00:17:09.579 --> 00:17:15.339
I'm curious in your view,
how important is technology

00:17:15.339 --> 00:17:17.550
for Hispanics in the US?

00:17:17.550 --> 00:17:20.480
You talked about education and
getting access to education.

00:17:20.480 --> 00:17:22.585
Where does technology
fit into all of it?

00:17:22.585 --> 00:17:23.710
THOMAS PEREZ: Oh, enormous.

00:17:23.710 --> 00:17:28.150
I mean we were just talking,
and I recall one of the slides

00:17:28.150 --> 00:17:30.880
said that Latinos are
something like three times

00:17:30.880 --> 00:17:32.280
more likely to
have a smartphone.

00:17:32.280 --> 00:17:35.640
Is that the right data point?

00:17:35.640 --> 00:17:36.560
And I see that.

00:17:36.560 --> 00:17:40.760
I mean we have 5.9 million
job openings right now

00:17:40.760 --> 00:17:42.660
across America,
which is the highest

00:17:42.660 --> 00:17:45.760
number we've had since we've
been keeping this data series.

00:17:45.760 --> 00:17:50.840
And about 1/10 of those job
openings are in the IT space.

00:17:50.840 --> 00:17:55.240
And a substantial
subset of those

00:17:55.240 --> 00:17:58.940
don't require a college degree,
so when I talk about IT,

00:17:58.940 --> 00:18:01.260
sometimes people's first
reaction is, well, I

00:18:01.260 --> 00:18:05.230
don't have time to get
a Ph.D. And the response

00:18:05.230 --> 00:18:06.790
is, you don't need a Ph.D.

00:18:06.790 --> 00:18:09.820
And we've made a
lot of investments

00:18:09.820 --> 00:18:12.660
and formed a lot of partnerships
with public school systems

00:18:12.660 --> 00:18:17.010
to translate that fluency
that a lot of young people,

00:18:17.010 --> 00:18:19.060
including but not
limited to young Latinos,

00:18:19.060 --> 00:18:22.560
have with their gadgets,
and translate that

00:18:22.560 --> 00:18:27.880
into a pipeline to
a middle class job.

00:18:27.880 --> 00:18:30.530
And so it's really
exciting to go and see

00:18:30.530 --> 00:18:33.200
these coding camps and other
things that are available.

00:18:33.200 --> 00:18:37.980
So I mean technology, and I
wouldn't limit it to Latinos.

00:18:37.980 --> 00:18:40.650
I mean if you're not
tech savvy, you're

00:18:40.650 --> 00:18:44.110
just not going to succeed
in a 21st century economy.

00:18:44.110 --> 00:18:46.290
And we still have
this digital divide,

00:18:46.290 --> 00:18:49.765
and so we have more work
to do in that space.

00:18:49.765 --> 00:18:50.890
DANIEL ALEGRE: And I agree.

00:18:50.890 --> 00:18:54.240
I think the incredible access
to mobile and mobile telephony

00:18:54.240 --> 00:18:56.740
and mobile phones and
getting cheaper and cheaper

00:18:56.740 --> 00:19:00.280
is really just opening up the
entire world of information

00:19:00.280 --> 00:19:02.534
and access to
education to anybody.

00:19:02.534 --> 00:19:03.700
I'll ask the first question.

00:19:03.700 --> 00:19:04.510
You mind introducing yourself?

00:19:04.510 --> 00:19:06.090
AUDIENCE: My question's
actually really into--

00:19:06.090 --> 00:19:07.300
DANIEL ALEGRE: Do you mind
introducing yourself, please?

00:19:07.300 --> 00:19:08.950
AUDIENCE: Yeah,
my name is Jorge,

00:19:08.950 --> 00:19:15.110
and my question is related
to the automation of jobs

00:19:15.110 --> 00:19:16.500
in America.

00:19:16.500 --> 00:19:19.260
Specifically, I was
looking at an article

00:19:19.260 --> 00:19:24.270
on Planet Money on NPR that was
published last year that said

00:19:24.270 --> 00:19:28.810
that the most common job across
most states was truck driving,

00:19:28.810 --> 00:19:32.000
and with the advent of
self-driving cars, which Google

00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:35.830
is also developing here,
probably all those jobs

00:19:35.830 --> 00:19:37.040
are going to be automated.

00:19:37.040 --> 00:19:38.990
So we're going to have
self-driving trucks,

00:19:38.990 --> 00:19:42.714
and then we also have the
CEO of Carl's Jr. saying

00:19:42.714 --> 00:19:45.130
that he's going to replace a
lot of the jobs in Carl's Jr.

00:19:45.130 --> 00:19:48.930
restaurants with automated
robots or machines.

00:19:48.930 --> 00:19:52.640
And for example, my own dad
just lost his job recently

00:19:52.640 --> 00:19:55.770
and was working as an Uber
driver, which is probably

00:19:55.770 --> 00:19:58.980
also going to be a job that's
going to get automated away

00:19:58.980 --> 00:20:01.180
with Uber testing
out self-driving cars

00:20:01.180 --> 00:20:02.270
in Pittsburgh.

00:20:02.270 --> 00:20:05.620
So how is Labor
Department looking

00:20:05.620 --> 00:20:09.540
at this automation of
jobs and planning ahead

00:20:09.540 --> 00:20:11.190
to make sure that
a lot of people

00:20:11.190 --> 00:20:13.090
aren't left out in
the cold when we

00:20:13.090 --> 00:20:14.900
have structural changes
in the labor laws?

00:20:14.900 --> 00:20:16.650
THOMAS PEREZ: Well,
it's a great question,

00:20:16.650 --> 00:20:18.650
and as someone who grew
up in Buffalo, New York,

00:20:18.650 --> 00:20:21.770
I have firsthand
knowledge of what happens

00:20:21.770 --> 00:20:23.400
when you're not prepared.

00:20:23.400 --> 00:20:25.800
I was a kid when my
father passed away,

00:20:25.800 --> 00:20:31.120
and my surrogate father had the
ninth or 10th grade education.

00:20:31.120 --> 00:20:33.740
He was the wisest person
I met, and I've actually

00:20:33.740 --> 00:20:36.450
grown to wonder whether
there's an inverse correlation

00:20:36.450 --> 00:20:38.320
between the number
of years you have

00:20:38.320 --> 00:20:41.380
of education and your wisdom.

00:20:41.380 --> 00:20:43.530
But that's an aside.

00:20:43.530 --> 00:20:47.540
And he was a teamster,
and he lost his job

00:20:47.540 --> 00:20:49.980
when the economy
tanked in Buffalo.

00:20:49.980 --> 00:20:54.540
And because he had
a lot of talent,

00:20:54.540 --> 00:20:57.590
but he never had access
to opportunity to upskill.

00:20:57.590 --> 00:21:03.020
So he ended up pumping gas,
working as a security guard,

00:21:03.020 --> 00:21:05.160
doing anything to
make ends meet.

00:21:05.160 --> 00:21:09.320
And so what I learned from
that very personal message

00:21:09.320 --> 00:21:11.330
of watching them suffer
and lose their home

00:21:11.330 --> 00:21:15.110
and lose their dignity
was that we always

00:21:15.110 --> 00:21:16.590
have to be one step ahead.

00:21:16.590 --> 00:21:18.800
This is not the first time
in our nation's history

00:21:18.800 --> 00:21:22.530
that the very important question
you asked has been asked.

00:21:22.530 --> 00:21:26.500
And the key is not only to
provide people with the skills

00:21:26.500 --> 00:21:29.340
to succeed today, but
with the core competencies

00:21:29.340 --> 00:21:34.340
to thrive tomorrow so
that today it's the cloud.

00:21:34.340 --> 00:21:37.940
In a few years, the cloud
will become the abacus.

00:21:37.940 --> 00:21:40.790
And so you want to equip
people with the fluency

00:21:40.790 --> 00:21:44.150
to do IT work at the Department
of Labor today with the cloud,

00:21:44.150 --> 00:21:47.200
but also with that competency
to keep moving forward.

00:21:47.200 --> 00:21:52.380
Learning is lifelong, and
the Republic Steel plant,

00:21:52.380 --> 00:21:55.770
which employed 20,000 people
when I was a kid in Buffalo,

00:21:55.770 --> 00:22:00.270
is being replaced by the largest
solar panel manufacturing

00:22:00.270 --> 00:22:03.710
facility in the Western
hemisphere, a Solar City plant.

00:22:03.710 --> 00:22:06.830
And that will
probably employ 4,000,

00:22:06.830 --> 00:22:09.720
something like that, a fraction
of what it used to employ.

00:22:09.720 --> 00:22:11.400
And we've got to
make sure, and you'll

00:22:11.400 --> 00:22:15.800
see tablets, not
folks running around

00:22:15.800 --> 00:22:18.600
with hammers, because that's
the world in which we live.

00:22:18.600 --> 00:22:20.960
And so I think the key
there is to make sure

00:22:20.960 --> 00:22:24.050
that we are always equipped
with the skills that

00:22:24.050 --> 00:22:25.190
will enable us to thrive.

00:22:25.190 --> 00:22:26.720
And for some people,
thriving will

00:22:26.720 --> 00:22:30.770
mean entering a new line
of work, a steel worker

00:22:30.770 --> 00:22:33.440
that we helped to
retrain and retool,

00:22:33.440 --> 00:22:35.680
so now he's in
advanced manufacturing.

00:22:35.680 --> 00:22:37.450
And so today's
drivers, I still think

00:22:37.450 --> 00:22:40.310
they have a good glide
path ahead of them

00:22:40.310 --> 00:22:42.660
for a number of years to
come, but we will always

00:22:42.660 --> 00:22:46.510
make sure they're
prepared for whatever

00:22:46.510 --> 00:22:51.114
happens in the next iteration
of technological advance.

00:22:51.114 --> 00:22:51.780
AUDIENCE: Great.

00:22:51.780 --> 00:22:53.810
Thank you.

00:22:53.810 --> 00:22:55.812
AUDIENCE: Good afternoon,
Secretary Perez.

00:22:55.812 --> 00:22:57.080
This is Javier Gonzales.

00:22:57.080 --> 00:23:00.290
I just wanted to ask you, what
are some of the key moments

00:23:00.290 --> 00:23:02.790
with President Barack Obama
that you've had that you'll be

00:23:02.790 --> 00:23:05.335
sharing in your
memoir once you're--

00:23:05.335 --> 00:23:06.710
THOMAS PEREZ:
Well, I don't think

00:23:06.710 --> 00:23:08.780
I can get enough people
to read my memoir,

00:23:08.780 --> 00:23:12.560
so my memoir is going
to stick in my head.

00:23:12.560 --> 00:23:15.220
It's incredible--
it's always helpful--

00:23:15.220 --> 00:23:18.410
just like this is sort
of a basic moment,

00:23:18.410 --> 00:23:20.269
and I don't think
it's groundbreaking.

00:23:20.269 --> 00:23:22.060
It's always nice when
you have the smartest

00:23:22.060 --> 00:23:24.540
person in the room on
your side, because we've

00:23:24.540 --> 00:23:26.240
been in a lot of
tense situations,

00:23:26.240 --> 00:23:32.340
and his command of the
issues is remarkable.

00:23:32.340 --> 00:23:36.010
And when I think about
my memories with him,

00:23:36.010 --> 00:23:38.730
I think about really,
I think the courage

00:23:38.730 --> 00:23:43.180
that he's had to
do things that have

00:23:43.180 --> 00:23:45.970
people, a lot of naysayers.

00:23:45.970 --> 00:23:48.880
History will judge the
Affordable Care Act as one

00:23:48.880 --> 00:23:53.510
of the most important
additions to our social safety

00:23:53.510 --> 00:23:56.890
net in our nation's
history, but we

00:23:56.890 --> 00:23:58.390
have a number of
challenges now that

00:23:58.390 --> 00:24:01.090
are borne in no small
measure from the fact

00:24:01.090 --> 00:24:05.920
that there has been a
relentless campaign of people

00:24:05.920 --> 00:24:10.210
to make it fail,
and governors who

00:24:10.210 --> 00:24:14.410
are leaving billions
of dollars on the table

00:24:14.410 --> 00:24:18.980
so that they don't give
Barack Obama a victory,

00:24:18.980 --> 00:24:22.720
even though they're hurting
literally tens of thousands,

00:24:22.720 --> 00:24:24.750
if not more of
their constituents.

00:24:24.750 --> 00:24:26.510
So I guess number
one is just watching

00:24:26.510 --> 00:24:30.570
him understand that
I don't care as much

00:24:30.570 --> 00:24:32.590
about how I'm judged tomorrow.

00:24:32.590 --> 00:24:36.440
I will look at this through
a long term prism of history.

00:24:36.440 --> 00:24:39.870
And I've seen that in the ACA.

00:24:39.870 --> 00:24:45.110
I've seen it in some work we
did enacting an overtime rule.

00:24:45.110 --> 00:24:47.240
I've seen it in work
we've done to make sure

00:24:47.240 --> 00:24:49.480
that people who
save for retirement

00:24:49.480 --> 00:24:53.850
have access to advice that's
in their best interest.

00:24:53.850 --> 00:24:57.820
We take a lot of heat
when you do those things,

00:24:57.820 --> 00:25:02.390
but frankly, I think every
day he's motivated as I am by,

00:25:02.390 --> 00:25:06.270
how can I strengthen and grow
the middle class in America?

00:25:06.270 --> 00:25:09.910
And I am absolutely-- he
has a lot more gray hair

00:25:09.910 --> 00:25:12.100
than he had eight years ago.

00:25:12.100 --> 00:25:14.620
I'm jealous,
because he has hair.

00:25:14.620 --> 00:25:17.940
So that's for me
what I will remember

00:25:17.940 --> 00:25:22.520
is those individual examples
of when we did the right thing.

00:25:22.520 --> 00:25:25.230
And I can go home to
my kid and say, hey,

00:25:25.230 --> 00:25:28.510
we helped 2 million home
health workers today

00:25:28.510 --> 00:25:32.940
get access to a decent
standard of living

00:25:32.940 --> 00:25:36.650
because of a final
rule we put in place.

00:25:36.650 --> 00:25:38.260
That's kind of cool.

00:25:38.260 --> 00:25:41.160
And it wouldn't
happen but for him.

00:25:41.160 --> 00:25:42.410
AUDIENCE: Thank you very much.

00:25:42.410 --> 00:25:44.826
AUDIENCE: Thank you for coming
in and taking our questions

00:25:44.826 --> 00:25:46.210
today, Secretary Perez.

00:25:46.210 --> 00:25:48.450
So my name is Benjamin Clark.

00:25:48.450 --> 00:25:51.180
For obvious reasons, much of
the focus on the labor market

00:25:51.180 --> 00:25:53.720
is on helping the
unemployed find jobs.

00:25:53.720 --> 00:25:56.420
However, it is also important
to help those currently employed

00:25:56.420 --> 00:25:58.020
who want a better job find it.

00:25:58.020 --> 00:25:59.710
This includes those
working part time,

00:25:59.710 --> 00:26:02.370
but want full time work, those
working in positions which

00:26:02.370 --> 00:26:05.000
don't utilize their
training or education,

00:26:05.000 --> 00:26:07.380
and those simply looking
for a higher paid job.

00:26:07.380 --> 00:26:10.070
Surfing LinkedIn and
other job aggregator sites

00:26:10.070 --> 00:26:13.970
and submitting dozens of resumes
isn't a great or scalable

00:26:13.970 --> 00:26:16.550
approach, especially
with 10 million employers

00:26:16.550 --> 00:26:18.420
in the United States today.

00:26:18.420 --> 00:26:20.760
So what changes can be made
to increase labor market

00:26:20.760 --> 00:26:23.180
efficiency for these
workers, and what

00:26:23.180 --> 00:26:25.857
role is there for government
and technology in doing so?

00:26:25.857 --> 00:26:27.440
THOMAS PEREZ: That's
a great question,

00:26:27.440 --> 00:26:30.610
and about two
years ago, Congress

00:26:30.610 --> 00:26:33.250
in one of the
regrettably few pieces

00:26:33.250 --> 00:26:36.670
of impactful
bipartisan legislation

00:26:36.670 --> 00:26:38.765
passed a bill called
the Workforce Innovation

00:26:38.765 --> 00:26:40.130
and Opportunity Act.

00:26:40.130 --> 00:26:43.850
And it was a
modernization of the rules

00:26:43.850 --> 00:26:46.410
of engagement for our
public workforce system.

00:26:46.410 --> 00:26:49.680
We have 2,500 American job
centers around the country.

00:26:49.680 --> 00:26:51.820
So if you lose your
job or you have a job,

00:26:51.820 --> 00:26:53.370
and you want to
get a better job,

00:26:53.370 --> 00:26:56.270
you can go to an American
Job Center free of cost,

00:26:56.270 --> 00:26:59.150
and we help literally
millions of people.

00:26:59.150 --> 00:27:01.440
These American Job
Centers were basically

00:27:01.440 --> 00:27:05.570
the nation's emergency room
during the Great Recession.

00:27:05.570 --> 00:27:08.430
And what the Workforce
Innovation and Opportunity

00:27:08.430 --> 00:27:10.460
Act has done is,
among other things,

00:27:10.460 --> 00:27:15.360
it has placed a focus on
not only folks who are out

00:27:15.360 --> 00:27:17.330
of a job who want
a job, but folks

00:27:17.330 --> 00:27:20.710
who are looking for incumbent
worker opportunities.

00:27:20.710 --> 00:27:22.240
So you're in the
job, but you want

00:27:22.240 --> 00:27:23.470
the skills for a better job.

00:27:23.470 --> 00:27:26.250
So a lot of the funding
streams that are

00:27:26.250 --> 00:27:28.980
coming through the Workforce
Innovation and Opportunity Act,

00:27:28.980 --> 00:27:32.680
before they were
focused more on someone

00:27:32.680 --> 00:27:34.320
who's looking for a job.

00:27:34.320 --> 00:27:35.750
Now there's still
a focus on that,

00:27:35.750 --> 00:27:37.480
but there's a lot
more flexibility.

00:27:37.480 --> 00:27:41.360
So in some markets,
really the issue

00:27:41.360 --> 00:27:44.370
is not getting people
in, because unemployment

00:27:44.370 --> 00:27:46.080
is really low.

00:27:46.080 --> 00:27:49.050
But it is upskilling
people, because there's

00:27:49.050 --> 00:27:50.950
a skills mismatch.

00:27:50.950 --> 00:27:52.690
There's a lot of
demand in one area,

00:27:52.690 --> 00:27:54.560
but we don't have the pipeline.

00:27:54.560 --> 00:27:56.900
So the Workforce Innovation
and Opportunity Act I think

00:27:56.900 --> 00:28:00.740
is a real key indicator.

00:28:00.740 --> 00:28:02.980
I'm actually going to
Glassdoor tomorrow,

00:28:02.980 --> 00:28:05.520
and part of what we're
going to discuss there

00:28:05.520 --> 00:28:09.690
is really about your question,
because the more information

00:28:09.690 --> 00:28:12.150
people have, the
more power they have.

00:28:12.150 --> 00:28:16.210
And I've really appreciated not
only data we get through you,

00:28:16.210 --> 00:28:21.610
but things that we've been
doing with Glassdoor to make

00:28:21.610 --> 00:28:23.280
the process more transparent.

00:28:23.280 --> 00:28:26.870
There's still too much
opaqueness to the job search

00:28:26.870 --> 00:28:31.570
process, and you still are
flying a little bit blind.

00:28:31.570 --> 00:28:35.590
You go into
somewhere, and we need

00:28:35.590 --> 00:28:39.245
to do more than just
Yelp for jobseekers.

00:28:39.245 --> 00:28:40.995
We need to, I think,
get more information,

00:28:40.995 --> 00:28:44.460
and Glassdoor-- we have
data that we collect.

00:28:44.460 --> 00:28:46.420
Glassdoor is a great
data aggregator,

00:28:46.420 --> 00:28:49.430
and so we're trying to figure
out what else we can do,

00:28:49.430 --> 00:28:53.790
because the market is shifting
from what it was before.

00:28:53.790 --> 00:28:56.040
AUDIENCE: Thank you very much.

00:28:56.040 --> 00:28:57.290
AUDIENCE: Hi, Secretary Perez.

00:28:57.290 --> 00:28:58.224
Bienvenido a Google.

00:28:58.224 --> 00:28:59.140
THOMAS PEREZ: Gracias.

00:28:59.140 --> 00:29:00.810
AUDIENCE: My name is Alberto,
and I'm an engineer here

00:29:00.810 --> 00:29:01.650
at Google.

00:29:01.650 --> 00:29:03.390
My question is,
lately there's been

00:29:03.390 --> 00:29:08.870
a lot of focus and narrative
around bringing jobs back,

00:29:08.870 --> 00:29:11.540
specifically manufacturing jobs.

00:29:11.540 --> 00:29:13.970
So given that the US
economy is actually

00:29:13.970 --> 00:29:18.050
greatly services-based, why
is the focus and the narrative

00:29:18.050 --> 00:29:19.740
around manufacturing jobs?

00:29:19.740 --> 00:29:22.060
Shouldn't it be around services?

00:29:22.060 --> 00:29:23.690
And if so, what
are the initiatives

00:29:23.690 --> 00:29:28.040
that the administration is
doing to amplify and increase

00:29:28.040 --> 00:29:32.230
the availability of jobs in
the service industry or sector?

00:29:32.230 --> 00:29:34.637
THOMAS PEREZ: Well, actually,
it's not an either/or.

00:29:34.637 --> 00:29:36.220
And when you look
at what we're doing,

00:29:36.220 --> 00:29:38.520
it's really both and then some.

00:29:38.520 --> 00:29:41.830
The emphasis on manufacturing
is a function of the fact

00:29:41.830 --> 00:29:44.930
that manufacturing has great
multiplier opportunities.

00:29:44.930 --> 00:29:50.370
When you create a manufacturing
job, I own a Ford Escape,

00:29:50.370 --> 00:29:52.650
and it was built in
Louisville, Kentucky.

00:29:52.650 --> 00:29:57.252
And now that they were 800
employees in the depths

00:29:57.252 --> 00:29:58.210
of the Great Recession.

00:29:58.210 --> 00:30:01.150
They're up to over 4,000
now, and that doesn't

00:30:01.150 --> 00:30:03.180
include their supply chain.

00:30:03.180 --> 00:30:06.650
And so when you create
good manufacturing jobs,

00:30:06.650 --> 00:30:12.980
you're able to have that very
remarkable multiplier effect,

00:30:12.980 --> 00:30:15.700
and also give opportunity--
in relationship

00:30:15.700 --> 00:30:17.640
to another question,
folks who've

00:30:17.640 --> 00:30:20.420
lost their job at
the steel mill,

00:30:20.420 --> 00:30:23.180
they're incredibly
capable of working

00:30:23.180 --> 00:30:26.130
in an advanced
manufacturing context.

00:30:26.130 --> 00:30:28.040
And what we're seeing
from our outreach

00:30:28.040 --> 00:30:30.910
to businesses is that the
reason why businesses are

00:30:30.910 --> 00:30:34.140
bullish about making things
in America is number one,

00:30:34.140 --> 00:30:38.300
we are the best consumer
in the world right now,

00:30:38.300 --> 00:30:42.630
and our economy is better
than basically everybody else.

00:30:42.630 --> 00:30:45.980
And number two, there's IT
stability in the United States.

00:30:45.980 --> 00:30:47.580
You make things
in China, and you

00:30:47.580 --> 00:30:52.790
employ a lot of lawyers who
are dealing with IT issues

00:30:52.790 --> 00:30:56.730
and intellectual property
issues of that nature.

00:30:56.730 --> 00:31:00.430
And I talk to a lot
of businesses, who

00:31:00.430 --> 00:31:02.620
talk a lot about cube footage.

00:31:02.620 --> 00:31:05.390
So if you're making
big things overseas,

00:31:05.390 --> 00:31:06.800
it costs a lot to
ship them home.

00:31:06.800 --> 00:31:10.690
I spent a lot of time here
during the ports dispute that

00:31:10.690 --> 00:31:12.980
really tied up the
West Coast port system,

00:31:12.980 --> 00:31:15.250
and the president sent me
here to try to resolve that.

00:31:15.250 --> 00:31:18.580
And I learned a lot about
why more and more folks who

00:31:18.580 --> 00:31:22.120
make things overseas are
thinking about making them here

00:31:22.120 --> 00:31:22.820
at home.

00:31:22.820 --> 00:31:27.600
And you look at the
Trans-Pacific Partnership,

00:31:27.600 --> 00:31:29.100
which is one of the
trade agreements

00:31:29.100 --> 00:31:34.080
that has been the focus of a
lot of discussion and debate,

00:31:34.080 --> 00:31:36.220
and trade agreements
always are the focus

00:31:36.220 --> 00:31:37.810
of discussion and debate.

00:31:37.810 --> 00:31:44.060
And there are entire chapters
on the services industry,

00:31:44.060 --> 00:31:47.430
because there's a recognition
that in our global economy,

00:31:47.430 --> 00:31:53.470
we don't simply make products
like airplanes for exports.

00:31:53.470 --> 00:31:56.380
The service sector
is a remarkable set

00:31:56.380 --> 00:32:00.380
of opportunities, of which
you've already availed yourself

00:32:00.380 --> 00:32:00.880
of.

00:32:00.880 --> 00:32:03.670
But as the president
has outlined,

00:32:03.670 --> 00:32:06.200
a properly done trade
agreement can even

00:32:06.200 --> 00:32:07.370
open up even more doors.

00:32:07.370 --> 00:32:11.580
So we're doing both and then
some is, I think, the upshot.

00:32:11.580 --> 00:32:13.974
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:32:13.974 --> 00:32:16.390
AUDIENCE: Thank you for joining
us today, Secretary Perez.

00:32:16.390 --> 00:32:17.580
My name Ana Dias Hernandez.

00:32:17.580 --> 00:32:20.190
I work at Udacity, which is
an online education company.

00:32:20.190 --> 00:32:22.950
And I work on workforce
development partnerships, as

00:32:22.950 --> 00:32:24.370
well as employer partnerships.

00:32:24.370 --> 00:32:27.680
So I help our students get jobs
after they take our courses.

00:32:27.680 --> 00:32:29.722
And so my question
is really aligned

00:32:29.722 --> 00:32:32.180
on so a part of our strategy
is that we work with companies

00:32:32.180 --> 00:32:34.388
to create courses that are
relevant for the workforce

00:32:34.388 --> 00:32:37.320
so that people can take
the course and get a job.

00:32:37.320 --> 00:32:40.250
And sometimes those companies
even help fund scholarships

00:32:40.250 --> 00:32:43.250
so that the students out there
in the workforce can take them

00:32:43.250 --> 00:32:45.640
and then aspire to get
a job in that sector.

00:32:45.640 --> 00:32:47.220
And so my question
to you would be,

00:32:47.220 --> 00:32:48.970
where do you think
companies could take

00:32:48.970 --> 00:32:51.270
some leadership around
funding courses,

00:32:51.270 --> 00:32:53.870
where there's a current
market gap, where there aren't

00:32:53.870 --> 00:32:55.830
enough people trained
to do something,

00:32:55.830 --> 00:32:58.940
and that could really
be thinking, one, two,

00:32:58.940 --> 00:33:02.520
five years ahead and start
training people right away?

00:33:02.520 --> 00:33:05.090
THOMAS PEREZ: We're
starting to see, I think,

00:33:05.090 --> 00:33:08.890
a very promising
evolution in that space.

00:33:08.890 --> 00:33:11.130
I mean we do a lot of
work in this space.

00:33:11.130 --> 00:33:14.940
We have an entire office
of workforce development

00:33:14.940 --> 00:33:18.630
that is all about the work
that you're describing.

00:33:18.630 --> 00:33:22.390
And the old model
of HR I describe

00:33:22.390 --> 00:33:25.390
as the cannibalism model of HR.

00:33:25.390 --> 00:33:28.320
You've got talent here, so
I'll cherry pick your talent,

00:33:28.320 --> 00:33:32.590
and then you cherry pick my
talent, and that's zero sum HR.

00:33:32.590 --> 00:33:35.480
What we're seeing now in
today's paradigm, which

00:33:35.480 --> 00:33:38.560
is very exciting, is that
sectors are coming together

00:33:38.560 --> 00:33:41.070
recognizing that we've
got to grow the pie.

00:33:41.070 --> 00:33:47.240
We've got to create a
virtuous cycle, and the way we

00:33:47.240 --> 00:33:53.330
do that is through aggregating
our collective wisdom,

00:33:53.330 --> 00:33:59.090
coming together around
working with people who train,

00:33:59.090 --> 00:34:01.320
so community colleges
and colleges.

00:34:01.320 --> 00:34:05.680
And you go to-- I spent a lot
of time with community colleges.

00:34:05.680 --> 00:34:08.659
And the reason why they're
having so much success

00:34:08.659 --> 00:34:15.500
is because they have
business representation

00:34:15.500 --> 00:34:16.480
in their department.

00:34:16.480 --> 00:34:19.010
So when you're taking a course,
you're getting a degree,

00:34:19.010 --> 00:34:22.870
you're getting a certificate,
that business has a lot more

00:34:22.870 --> 00:34:28.320
confidence that that degree
has the requisite competencies

00:34:28.320 --> 00:34:33.020
to thrive in my company,
because I helped create it.

00:34:33.020 --> 00:34:35.250
And I've talked to a lot
of business owners, who

00:34:35.250 --> 00:34:38.610
are kind of a little bit ripped,
frankly, at four-year higher

00:34:38.610 --> 00:34:41.300
ed, because I'm getting these
people who have a computer

00:34:41.300 --> 00:34:43.120
science degree.

00:34:43.120 --> 00:34:46.250
But then they come in,
and they don't really

00:34:46.250 --> 00:34:48.590
have a lot of the basics.

00:34:48.590 --> 00:34:50.010
I've heard this in the sciences.

00:34:50.010 --> 00:34:51.920
People who have a
degree, but they

00:34:51.920 --> 00:34:54.199
don't know how to work in
a lab, because they never

00:34:54.199 --> 00:34:55.650
had the practical experience.

00:34:55.650 --> 00:34:58.590
So I think what we're
seeing now through what

00:34:58.590 --> 00:35:02.560
we call sector strategies,
where we get an IT sector,

00:35:02.560 --> 00:35:06.080
and we understand, what are
your needs projected forward,

00:35:06.080 --> 00:35:09.890
and how do we do a better job
of working with our institutions

00:35:09.890 --> 00:35:13.250
so that they are producing that
pipeline of folks that don't

00:35:13.250 --> 00:35:16.900
simply have the degree, but they
have the core competencies that

00:35:16.900 --> 00:35:19.710
come with that degree
that are necessary?

00:35:19.710 --> 00:35:22.930
And that's, to me, what's
exciting about today's-- I call

00:35:22.930 --> 00:35:26.860
it the-- we're constructing
a skill superhighway.

00:35:26.860 --> 00:35:29.629
And we need new and
different on ramps.

00:35:29.629 --> 00:35:31.670
We're doing a lot in the
world of apprenticeship.

00:35:31.670 --> 00:35:33.170
When you think of
an apprentice, you

00:35:33.170 --> 00:35:35.200
think of a plumber
and a carpenter.

00:35:35.200 --> 00:35:38.380
An apprenticeship has
obvious application there,

00:35:38.380 --> 00:35:41.510
but if you go to Europe,
which I have done,

00:35:41.510 --> 00:35:44.190
you will see 18 and
19-year-olds and 16

00:35:44.190 --> 00:35:47.310
and 17-year-old
apprentices, who are

00:35:47.310 --> 00:35:50.130
going to be tomorrow's CEOs.

00:35:50.130 --> 00:35:53.640
The most recent CEO of Zurich
Insurance, a Fortune 500

00:35:53.640 --> 00:35:55.390
company, started out
as an apprentice.

00:35:55.390 --> 00:35:59.070
So we're trying to build these
new on ramps and off ramps that

00:35:59.070 --> 00:36:00.500
address exactly
what you're doing,

00:36:00.500 --> 00:36:02.990
because the good news--
we have a great problem,

00:36:02.990 --> 00:36:06.280
but it is a problem, which is
that businesses are bullish.

00:36:06.280 --> 00:36:07.930
They want to grow
their business.

00:36:07.930 --> 00:36:11.310
And we've got to make sure
that the pipeline of folks,

00:36:11.310 --> 00:36:13.510
especially the pipeline
living in communities that

00:36:13.510 --> 00:36:16.130
have been historically
underserved,

00:36:16.130 --> 00:36:18.804
is ready for that task.

00:36:18.804 --> 00:36:20.220
I'm confident we
can do it, but it

00:36:20.220 --> 00:36:24.762
does take that much more
collaboration at scale.

00:36:24.762 --> 00:36:25.699
Yes, sir.

00:36:25.699 --> 00:36:26.240
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:36:26.240 --> 00:36:27.880
Thank you, Secretary
Perez for coming.

00:36:27.880 --> 00:36:29.650
My name is David Moulton.

00:36:29.650 --> 00:36:31.880
Despite the fact
that people have

00:36:31.880 --> 00:36:36.530
been talking about the
gender wage gap for decades,

00:36:36.530 --> 00:36:39.720
women are still
making less money

00:36:39.720 --> 00:36:41.060
for doing equivalent jobs.

00:36:41.060 --> 00:36:43.140
So what do you think are
the kind of best ways

00:36:43.140 --> 00:36:45.430
that we as a country
can move forward

00:36:45.430 --> 00:36:48.310
to get to a point, where women
are making the same money

00:36:48.310 --> 00:36:49.887
for doing the same things?

00:36:49.887 --> 00:36:51.470
THOMAS PEREZ: That's
a great question.

00:36:51.470 --> 00:36:53.820
I'm looking at your
t-shirt, and I'm

00:36:53.820 --> 00:36:56.340
reflecting on a visit I
made to one of my friends

00:36:56.340 --> 00:36:58.420
in college to
Princeton, and it was

00:36:58.420 --> 00:37:01.540
the first time I had seen an
orange squirrel in my life.

00:37:01.540 --> 00:37:03.364
So I wanted to comment
on your t-shirt.

00:37:03.364 --> 00:37:04.280
AUDIENCE: A black one.

00:37:04.280 --> 00:37:05.446
THOMAS PEREZ: But I digress.

00:37:07.930 --> 00:37:10.820
I mean there's no one
quick answer to that.

00:37:10.820 --> 00:37:12.510
But one thing we've
been doing lately,

00:37:12.510 --> 00:37:14.520
and we were having this
conversation today,

00:37:14.520 --> 00:37:17.450
is pay transparency.

00:37:17.450 --> 00:37:21.600
When Lilly Ledbetter-- the first
law that the president signed

00:37:21.600 --> 00:37:23.670
was the Lilly
Ledbetter Fair Pay Act.

00:37:23.670 --> 00:37:27.070
And she was working
at her job in Alabama,

00:37:27.070 --> 00:37:30.470
and doing identical work to
men, making less than them,

00:37:30.470 --> 00:37:33.190
and the way she found
out was because someone

00:37:33.190 --> 00:37:34.905
slipped her an anonymous note.

00:37:34.905 --> 00:37:35.530
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:37:35.530 --> 00:37:36.446
Happened to my mother.

00:37:36.446 --> 00:37:39.730
THOMAS PEREZ: You know,
you all understand

00:37:39.730 --> 00:37:42.110
the importance of data,
and data shouldn't just

00:37:42.110 --> 00:37:43.460
be collected and hidden.

00:37:43.460 --> 00:37:45.800
Data should be collected
and made available.

00:37:45.800 --> 00:37:47.380
So that's one thing.

00:37:47.380 --> 00:37:50.030
Another thing we
need to do is to make

00:37:50.030 --> 00:37:55.040
sure we have 21st century paid
leave and childcare policies.

00:37:55.040 --> 00:37:58.320
If you compare labor
force participation

00:37:58.320 --> 00:38:02.850
of women in the US and
Canada in the year 2000,

00:38:02.850 --> 00:38:04.100
it was virtually identical.

00:38:04.100 --> 00:38:04.790
You look now.

00:38:04.790 --> 00:38:06.789
Canada is about eight
points higher than we are,

00:38:06.789 --> 00:38:10.242
because they've invested in
paid leave and childcare.

00:38:10.242 --> 00:38:11.700
And so if we'd have
kept pace, we'd

00:38:11.700 --> 00:38:15.600
have 5 and 1/2 million more
women in the workplace,

00:38:15.600 --> 00:38:17.930
5 and 1/2 million more
women contributing

00:38:17.930 --> 00:38:20.860
to the social security trust
fund, the Medicare trust fund,

00:38:20.860 --> 00:38:25.110
and contributing to making,
whether it's the Silicon

00:38:25.110 --> 00:38:28.640
Valley, Wall Street, or Main
Street look more like America.

00:38:28.640 --> 00:38:32.750
I think those two issues
are absolutely huge.

00:38:32.750 --> 00:38:36.390
And so when you leave the
market, you end up coming back,

00:38:36.390 --> 00:38:38.400
and you've fallen behind.

00:38:38.400 --> 00:38:42.840
And so then you see
these gaps exacerbated.

00:38:42.840 --> 00:38:46.220
And then finally, you've
got to enforce the laws,

00:38:46.220 --> 00:38:49.930
because I've seen some textbook
examples of nuts and bolts

00:38:49.930 --> 00:38:51.150
discrimination.

00:38:51.150 --> 00:38:55.770
And so I'm heartened by the fact
that more and more employers

00:38:55.770 --> 00:38:58.730
are understanding, and we're
seeing a lot more leadership

00:38:58.730 --> 00:39:03.230
on this issue, because we're
leaving too much talent

00:39:03.230 --> 00:39:05.060
on the sideline with this.

00:39:05.060 --> 00:39:10.820
And it just is not right.

00:39:10.820 --> 00:39:12.239
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:39:12.239 --> 00:39:12.780
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:39:12.780 --> 00:39:14.280
My name is Julissa
Ramirez, and I

00:39:14.280 --> 00:39:16.010
am a Dominicana from New York.

00:39:16.010 --> 00:39:18.000
So happy to have you here.

00:39:18.000 --> 00:39:21.320
My question is, as
you know, the number

00:39:21.320 --> 00:39:24.420
of STEM jobs, a very
small percentage of those

00:39:24.420 --> 00:39:26.340
are held by Latinos.

00:39:26.340 --> 00:39:28.830
What is your department
doing to increase

00:39:28.830 --> 00:39:32.534
the number of Latinas and
Latinos in STEM jobs in the US?

00:39:32.534 --> 00:39:34.950
THOMAS PEREZ: Well, that's an
all hands on deck enterprise

00:39:34.950 --> 00:39:37.150
across the
administration working

00:39:37.150 --> 00:39:40.460
with the Department of Energy,
the Department of Education.

00:39:40.460 --> 00:39:43.960
I was convening earlier today
with the California Endowment

00:39:43.960 --> 00:39:49.440
talking about how we increased
the pipeline of minority

00:39:49.440 --> 00:39:51.770
students in the
health professions.

00:39:51.770 --> 00:39:53.650
That's a public
health challenge,

00:39:53.650 --> 00:39:57.250
because there's too many
under-served communities.

00:39:57.250 --> 00:39:59.370
And there's a
robust body of data

00:39:59.370 --> 00:40:02.540
showing that health
care providers of color

00:40:02.540 --> 00:40:04.690
are more likely to serve
communities of color.

00:40:04.690 --> 00:40:08.775
And so that's why
it starts at pre-K.

00:40:08.775 --> 00:40:12.190
One of the reasons the
president has supported

00:40:12.190 --> 00:40:14.580
dramatic investments
in early childhood

00:40:14.580 --> 00:40:17.290
is because the research
is overwhelming.

00:40:17.290 --> 00:40:20.190
All too many people, by the
time they're three years old,

00:40:20.190 --> 00:40:23.690
because of
opportunity gaps, they

00:40:23.690 --> 00:40:27.520
have not heard nearly
the number of words

00:40:27.520 --> 00:40:29.540
that other folks have heard.

00:40:29.540 --> 00:40:32.100
And so you start out when
you're three years old,

00:40:32.100 --> 00:40:34.050
and you're already up
against the eight ball.

00:40:34.050 --> 00:40:38.530
So your question calls for,
I think, a very holistic set

00:40:38.530 --> 00:40:41.310
of investments starting
from pre-K, making sure

00:40:41.310 --> 00:40:43.810
that pipeline-- the
pipeline springs leaks

00:40:43.810 --> 00:40:45.200
in so many different places.

00:40:45.200 --> 00:40:48.950
We still have too many
schools that are not

00:40:48.950 --> 00:40:50.500
where they need to be.

00:40:50.500 --> 00:40:53.250
And we still have
too many young kids

00:40:53.250 --> 00:40:55.290
of color, who
don't have mentors.

00:40:55.290 --> 00:40:57.850
And there's a lot
of evidence showing

00:40:57.850 --> 00:41:01.430
that the absence of mentors is
a big deal for folks as well.

00:41:01.430 --> 00:41:05.370
So there's really a soup to
nuts, cradle to grave approach

00:41:05.370 --> 00:41:07.830
that we have to take
to this, because we've

00:41:07.830 --> 00:41:09.090
got a lot more work to do.

00:41:09.090 --> 00:41:11.170
And it's a public health
imperative in the health

00:41:11.170 --> 00:41:12.350
professions context.

00:41:12.350 --> 00:41:14.300
It's an economic
imperative for all of us,

00:41:14.300 --> 00:41:17.450
and frankly, it's
a moral imperative.

00:41:17.450 --> 00:41:18.110
Last question.

00:41:18.110 --> 00:41:18.950
DANIEL ALEGRE: Last
question, yeah.

00:41:18.950 --> 00:41:19.250
AUDIENCE: Last question.

00:41:19.250 --> 00:41:20.370
OK.

00:41:20.370 --> 00:41:22.170
Secretary Perez,
thank you for being

00:41:22.170 --> 00:41:23.940
here with us this afternoon.

00:41:23.940 --> 00:41:26.060
My name is Michael
Wooley-Ousdahl.

00:41:26.060 --> 00:41:28.230
I'm on Google's
transportation team.

00:41:28.230 --> 00:41:30.600
Climate change is
really important to me

00:41:30.600 --> 00:41:32.470
and being energy independent.

00:41:32.470 --> 00:41:35.450
I'm curious your
thoughts on coal country.

00:41:35.450 --> 00:41:38.640
My great-grandfather was a
coal miner in Pennsylvania.

00:41:38.640 --> 00:41:40.850
You heard this at
the debate yesterday.

00:41:40.850 --> 00:41:44.380
This ongoing kind of
disconnect with the narrative

00:41:44.380 --> 00:41:45.930
of folks that are
in coal country

00:41:45.930 --> 00:41:49.750
that their livelihood is
based on fossil fuels,

00:41:49.750 --> 00:41:52.590
and our need to become
energy independent

00:41:52.590 --> 00:41:54.400
and invest in clean energy.

00:41:54.400 --> 00:41:56.230
And there seems
to be a disconnect

00:41:56.230 --> 00:41:59.110
in that narrative with
the Democratic Party

00:41:59.110 --> 00:42:03.090
and folks in coal country and
whose livelihood is based on,

00:42:03.090 --> 00:42:08.350
their labor pool is based
on fossil fuels and coal.

00:42:08.350 --> 00:42:12.190
How do you hope the future
administration going forward,

00:42:12.190 --> 00:42:15.710
whoever's elected, a
Democrat or a Republican,

00:42:15.710 --> 00:42:19.260
how do you hope they approach
that narrative of investing

00:42:19.260 --> 00:42:22.220
in clean energy and
climate change with this

00:42:22.220 --> 00:42:25.300
disconnect with folks
that livelihoods are

00:42:25.300 --> 00:42:28.100
based on fossil fuels and coal?

00:42:28.100 --> 00:42:31.540
THOMAS PEREZ: Well, I hope we
can have honest dialogue that

00:42:31.540 --> 00:42:33.020
is evidence-based.

00:42:33.020 --> 00:42:36.160
When I hear about
the war on coal,

00:42:36.160 --> 00:42:40.510
one of the biggest forces that
has created a challenge in coal

00:42:40.510 --> 00:42:43.110
country is natural gas.

00:42:43.110 --> 00:42:45.960
But that's not
what is discussed.

00:42:45.960 --> 00:42:49.449
One of my favorite visits
in this job-- and it

00:42:49.449 --> 00:42:51.240
really goes to the
heart of your question--

00:42:51.240 --> 00:42:54.440
I was in coal country
Kentucky, Pipeville.

00:42:54.440 --> 00:42:57.930
And there was a
company that we helped

00:42:57.930 --> 00:43:01.590
to seed called Bitsource.

00:43:01.590 --> 00:43:03.440
And I went to a
training program.

00:43:03.440 --> 00:43:06.940
There were about
15 people there,

00:43:06.940 --> 00:43:08.870
and what they all had
in common is that they

00:43:08.870 --> 00:43:10.290
were generational coal miners.

00:43:10.290 --> 00:43:12.220
And as a guy who
grew up in Buffalo,

00:43:12.220 --> 00:43:16.200
I understand Buffalo's
manufacturing base wasn't

00:43:16.200 --> 00:43:17.770
simply a pipeline for jobs.

00:43:17.770 --> 00:43:19.700
It was part of our identity.

00:43:19.700 --> 00:43:22.820
And when you have
generational coal miners,

00:43:22.820 --> 00:43:26.270
and you say, well,
sorry, market forces

00:43:26.270 --> 00:43:30.020
are working against
you, that's not simply

00:43:30.020 --> 00:43:31.150
an economic statement.

00:43:31.150 --> 00:43:34.250
You're really going
at people's identity.

00:43:34.250 --> 00:43:37.070
But we have realities,
and in a lot

00:43:37.070 --> 00:43:39.880
of the places in Kentucky
and West Virginia,

00:43:39.880 --> 00:43:43.200
the cost of extraction
has become very expensive,

00:43:43.200 --> 00:43:46.600
because they've mined out all
the easy to mine out stuff.

00:43:46.600 --> 00:43:52.160
And given our environmental
necessities, et cetera,

00:43:52.160 --> 00:43:55.020
these folks were
learning how to code.

00:43:55.020 --> 00:43:59.280
And the motto of Bitsource
was from coal to code.

00:43:59.280 --> 00:44:05.820
And I remember vividly one
of the guys, who said to me,

00:44:05.820 --> 00:44:09.270
my company called me
last week to offer me

00:44:09.270 --> 00:44:11.260
a job back at the
mine, and I said no,

00:44:11.260 --> 00:44:13.970
because I feel like I have
more of a future here.

00:44:13.970 --> 00:44:17.770
Another guy said-- he had a
screenshot of his newborn,

00:44:17.770 --> 00:44:20.400
and he said, when my
son gets to be 10 or 12,

00:44:20.400 --> 00:44:22.810
and he says, Daddy,
I can't do this.

00:44:22.810 --> 00:44:24.760
I got a hard assignment school.

00:44:24.760 --> 00:44:27.460
I'm going to tell him, I
got out of the coal mine,

00:44:27.460 --> 00:44:28.590
because I did that.

00:44:28.590 --> 00:44:29.420
I lost my job.

00:44:29.420 --> 00:44:30.830
Your grandfather had that job.

00:44:30.830 --> 00:44:32.519
Your great-grandfather
had that job.

00:44:32.519 --> 00:44:35.060
And I lost my job, and I thought
I couldn't do anything else.

00:44:35.060 --> 00:44:38.100
I'd never turned a computer on
in my life, and now I'm coding.

00:44:38.100 --> 00:44:40.002
You can do anything, son.

00:44:40.002 --> 00:44:41.710
That's what he's going
to say to his son.

00:44:41.710 --> 00:44:44.620
And if there's one thing
I've learned in this job,

00:44:44.620 --> 00:44:48.870
it is how resilient people
are, because one constant

00:44:48.870 --> 00:44:52.550
that my father always
taught me is change.

00:44:52.550 --> 00:44:54.670
We are not a static country.

00:44:54.670 --> 00:44:57.630
Today there are
tens of thousands

00:44:57.630 --> 00:45:02.290
of good middle class
jobs for truck drivers.

00:45:02.290 --> 00:45:05.520
I don't know where that will be,
that world in 20 or 30 years.

00:45:05.520 --> 00:45:08.870
If you look at the studies,
sometimes the predictions

00:45:08.870 --> 00:45:13.330
of the impact of automation
prove not exactly

00:45:13.330 --> 00:45:15.230
to bear out as they might.

00:45:15.230 --> 00:45:17.620
But you always got
to prepare for it.

00:45:17.620 --> 00:45:21.110
And the thing that we have
going for us as a nation

00:45:21.110 --> 00:45:24.070
is that we've got a
resilient group of folks,

00:45:24.070 --> 00:45:28.910
and those folks in coal
country, they're now coding.

00:45:28.910 --> 00:45:33.770
And so what we are doing
as an administration, what

00:45:33.770 --> 00:45:36.940
we need to continue to do is
to make sure we say to folks,

00:45:36.940 --> 00:45:40.000
honestly, you know what?

00:45:40.000 --> 00:45:43.750
Our goal here is to make sure
that you can punch your ticket

00:45:43.750 --> 00:45:45.130
to the middle class.

00:45:45.130 --> 00:45:46.710
I can't look you
in the eye and say

00:45:46.710 --> 00:45:50.340
it's going to be in a coal mine,
because there's a lot of stuff

00:45:50.340 --> 00:45:51.810
happening out there.

00:45:51.810 --> 00:45:54.370
But what I can do is look
you in the eye and say,

00:45:54.370 --> 00:45:57.390
we're going to do
everything in our power

00:45:57.390 --> 00:46:02.720
to make sure that you have those
core competencies to thrive,

00:46:02.720 --> 00:46:04.970
and continue to punch your
ticket to the middle class.

00:46:04.970 --> 00:46:07.110
So it could be the
coders, or it can

00:46:07.110 --> 00:46:08.960
be the guy who came
to one of our meetings

00:46:08.960 --> 00:46:11.730
at the White House, drove
all night with his wife,

00:46:11.730 --> 00:46:15.590
generational coal
miner, who's now an EMT.

00:46:15.590 --> 00:46:17.750
And again, resilient.

00:46:17.750 --> 00:46:19.520
This is a resilient workforce.

00:46:19.520 --> 00:46:21.650
This is a resilient country.

00:46:21.650 --> 00:46:25.270
And when I hear folks
bad mouth this country

00:46:25.270 --> 00:46:29.030
and say the gloom
and doom stuff,

00:46:29.030 --> 00:46:30.700
you just haven't
made house calls,

00:46:30.700 --> 00:46:34.800
because I've met folks who
have been down on their luck

00:46:34.800 --> 00:46:36.140
through no fault of their own.

00:46:36.140 --> 00:46:39.566
And what always amazes me
is that stick-to-itiveness

00:46:39.566 --> 00:46:40.190
that they have.

00:46:40.190 --> 00:46:42.750
And we have to be part
of the connective tissue.

00:46:42.750 --> 00:46:46.650
That's why I love my job,
because part of what we do

00:46:46.650 --> 00:46:48.330
is we're match.com.

00:46:48.330 --> 00:46:51.590
We help connect
them to-- it might

00:46:51.590 --> 00:46:54.330
be a job in the same
industry, or it might

00:46:54.330 --> 00:46:57.360
be a totally different job.

00:46:57.360 --> 00:47:01.700
The good news is that employers
tell me everywhere I go,

00:47:01.700 --> 00:47:03.000
I'm bullish about the future.

00:47:03.000 --> 00:47:04.400
I want to grow my business.

00:47:04.400 --> 00:47:08.950
And what I need most, Tom, is
I need that skilled workforce,

00:47:08.950 --> 00:47:11.520
so I can continue to grow.

00:47:11.520 --> 00:47:14.260
I'm chronically optimistic
as a result of all

00:47:14.260 --> 00:47:16.080
of these conversations,
and we've

00:47:16.080 --> 00:47:18.779
been able to stay
at 5% unemployment.

00:47:18.779 --> 00:47:20.320
And you look at the
rest of the world

00:47:20.320 --> 00:47:22.540
where they're at, because
we've got this resilient

00:47:22.540 --> 00:47:25.070
workforce, resilient
business community,

00:47:25.070 --> 00:47:27.314
and some great partnerships.

00:47:27.314 --> 00:47:28.480
Thank you for your question.

00:47:28.480 --> 00:47:30.850
It's a great way to
end this conversation.

00:47:30.850 --> 00:47:33.526
[APPLAUSE]

00:47:36.340 --> 00:47:39.100
DANIEL ALEGRE: The energy with
which the secretary speaks

00:47:39.100 --> 00:47:39.910
is just infectious.

00:47:39.910 --> 00:47:42.900
I feel like I should go
and learn coding right now.

00:47:42.900 --> 00:47:43.680
I should.

00:47:43.680 --> 00:47:44.582
THOMAS PEREZ: Me too.

00:47:44.582 --> 00:47:46.790
DANIEL ALEGRE: But I think
your example of you owning

00:47:46.790 --> 00:47:49.850
a Ford and the
trickle effect that it

00:47:49.850 --> 00:47:53.320
has of being able to manufacture
here in the United States

00:47:53.320 --> 00:47:56.970
I think is also an example
of you as a Hispanic leader,

00:47:56.970 --> 00:47:59.820
the fact that you've
made it as far as you had

00:47:59.820 --> 00:48:01.320
in your career and
the impact you've

00:48:01.320 --> 00:48:03.574
had not only to your
family, your community,

00:48:03.574 --> 00:48:05.240
but everyone who looks
up to you I think

00:48:05.240 --> 00:48:07.300
is an inspiration
for many Hispanics

00:48:07.300 --> 00:48:09.440
all in the United States
and around the world.

00:48:09.440 --> 00:48:11.640
So on behalf of Google,
on behalf of Hola,

00:48:11.640 --> 00:48:12.670
thank you for coming.

00:48:12.670 --> 00:48:12.820
THOMAS PEREZ: Thank you.

00:48:12.820 --> 00:48:13.520
Muchas gracias.

00:48:13.520 --> 00:48:17.180
DANIEL ALEGRE: And best of
luck in this next few months,

00:48:17.180 --> 00:48:21.790
and obviously, in
2017 going forward.

00:48:21.790 --> 00:48:24.680
[APPLAUSE]

00:48:25.180 --> 00:48:26.860
Muchas gracias.
