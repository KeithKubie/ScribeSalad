[APPLAUSE]

00:00:02.761 --> 00:00:04.260
JAKOB KALBFELL:
Thank you very much.

00:00:04.260 --> 00:00:08.220
Welcome everybody to
our very own sauna here.

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:10.650
Bear with me for this
second last question

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:15.250
of the day, which is about
a kind of important topic.

00:00:15.250 --> 00:00:19.170
It's about the Holy
Grail of app developers,

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:20.939
because it's about revenues.

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:22.980
And if it's about revenues,
it's about money that

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:25.830
will make your business grow.

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:29.190
So we do the good
old hands up game one

00:00:29.190 --> 00:00:32.580
more time just to keep you a
bit moving after the break.

00:00:32.580 --> 00:00:38.163
Hands up if you optimize and
measure lifetime value already.

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:43.370
That's not-- that's
like 20% maybe.

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:45.170
Out of those--
keep your hands up.

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:47.360
Out of those who measure
and optimize lifetime value

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:51.110
already, how many of you would
say you do it really well

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:55.140
and you wouldn't change
a thing if you could.

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:55.640
Oh, OK.

00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:57.598
I think we haven't had
that in London or Paris.

00:00:57.598 --> 00:00:59.917
So that's 0% of
the audience, which

00:00:59.917 --> 00:01:02.000
in turn means the presentation
is highly relevant.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:03.980
So that's good.

00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:07.950
Lifetime value in the apps
world is quite a heavy topic,

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:09.890
especially in the
late afternoon hours.

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:13.700
We're going to try to get it
to you with this structure.

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:16.850
First of all, a little bit
like in driving school,

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:19.430
we're going to go into the
theoretical foundations

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:22.580
of lifetime value modeling
and of predictive analysis.

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:25.400
And secondly, we're going to
go into a bit more practical

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:28.225
perspective, applying
your theoretical knowledge

00:01:28.225 --> 00:01:30.350
and going into best practices
that you can actually

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:33.150
use in your own businesses.

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:37.160
Now, let's start directly
with the first part.

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:41.090
Predictive analysis is
the underlying theory

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:44.684
that helps you answer any kind
of question you ask yourself

00:01:44.684 --> 00:01:46.100
about the future
of your business.

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:50.390
It helps you answer or to
prove any kind of hypothesis

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:51.630
right or wrong.

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:54.440
So predictive analysis
is really a theory.

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:58.040
Lifetime value is a part of
this theory, but by far not

00:01:58.040 --> 00:01:59.000
the only one.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:02.120
Now, it enables you to
forecast users' behavior.

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:03.770
And as you can see
on the slide here,

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:06.050
this woman seems to
have a retail shop.

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:08.930
So she's asking herself
what products should I

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:11.150
put in my shop.

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:13.610
Where should I put the
products in my shop?

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:16.310
How many products
should I put in my shop?

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:18.770
How frequent will
users or buyers

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:21.170
come to my shop
and purchase goods?

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:24.110
What's the cost of acquiring
customers to my shop?

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:30.140
And what's the lifetime
value of my users in my shop?

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:34.220
Now, for predictive analysis,
there are very simple models

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:36.410
that you can apply to
answer those business

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:38.780
critical questions, and
there are very complex ones.

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:40.880
Simple models could
really be let's

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:44.180
say you have a social app,
and you're asking a specialist

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:47.570
to give you an analysis of how
much revenue you could actually

00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:49.590
make using ad monetization.

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:51.560
That's fairly
simple and helps you

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:53.169
understand that
question or to give

00:02:53.169 --> 00:02:54.335
the answer to that question.

00:02:54.335 --> 00:02:57.740
There are also extremely
complex models, some of which

00:02:57.740 --> 00:02:58.940
are really higher maths.

00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:01.310
So I'm not going to go
in-depth into those.

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:04.730
But be aware that
some structures like

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:07.400
Pareto, net by nominal
value, and so on could

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:08.150
be important here.

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:11.220
If you want to read up on that,
please feel free to do so.

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:15.350
To run predictive analysis,
who would have thought so?

00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:17.090
We need data.

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:19.490
And if we want
data, we need tools.

00:03:19.490 --> 00:03:24.320
So if you want to answer
those business questions,

00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:27.290
you have to be able to
put the right data in.

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:29.060
There are three things
to remember here.

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:32.690
First of all, choose
the right metrics.

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:34.280
Comes kind of obvious.

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:37.080
Typical metrics would be
engagement data, retention

00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:39.530
data, like Nico and Maxine
talked about before.

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:41.990
Number of active users
you might be expecting,

00:03:41.990 --> 00:03:44.570
frequency of visits,
recency of the last purchase

00:03:44.570 --> 00:03:46.582
or the last visit, and
so on and so forth.

00:03:46.582 --> 00:03:48.290
Make sure that you
put the variables that

00:03:48.290 --> 00:03:49.310
answer the question.

00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:52.910
Secondly, the importance
of those variables

00:03:52.910 --> 00:03:54.590
that you're feeding
into the data models

00:03:54.590 --> 00:03:57.750
actually depends on
several questions.

00:03:57.750 --> 00:03:59.870
First of all, type of the app.

00:03:59.870 --> 00:04:02.510
If you're a social app,
you care about engagement.

00:04:02.510 --> 00:04:04.370
Whereas if you're
a real estate app,

00:04:04.370 --> 00:04:06.570
you assume that engagement
is kind of cyclical.

00:04:06.570 --> 00:04:09.740
So users will only look
for apartments or houses

00:04:09.740 --> 00:04:14.510
in a very, very few months
of a year or of a decade.

00:04:14.510 --> 00:04:16.760
Lastly, depending on
the analytical model

00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:19.172
that you're actually using,
importance very as well.

00:04:19.172 --> 00:04:21.380
So if you're using a very
complex mathematical model,

00:04:21.380 --> 00:04:24.090
you will need a lot
more data than if you're

00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:25.670
using a simple one.

00:04:25.670 --> 00:04:29.900
Also the treatment of data
and the ability of your tool

00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:31.890
to process it is
highly important.

00:04:31.890 --> 00:04:33.724
So it has to be able
to import data quickly.

00:04:33.724 --> 00:04:35.431
It has to be able to
cluster it according

00:04:35.431 --> 00:04:37.850
to the question or the
hypothesis you're feeding in.

00:04:37.850 --> 00:04:41.480
And it has to be able to treat
the data quickly and give

00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:43.695
the output to you as
soon as you need it.

00:04:43.695 --> 00:04:46.930
So That's data.

00:04:46.930 --> 00:04:48.910
Predictive analysis,
however doesn't only

00:04:48.910 --> 00:04:53.200
depend on the data you have
from your analytical tools.

00:04:53.200 --> 00:04:56.230
It also depends on some
contextual factors.

00:04:56.230 --> 00:04:59.997
One example being, do you have a
contractual or a noncontractual

00:04:59.997 --> 00:05:01.080
relationship to your user?

00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:05.110
A contractual relationship
could be your electricity bill.

00:05:05.110 --> 00:05:07.270
Or it could be a
subscription in a news app.

00:05:07.270 --> 00:05:09.010
That's contractual relationship.

00:05:09.010 --> 00:05:11.860
It gives you already
the lifetime of how long

00:05:11.860 --> 00:05:15.754
will you get your fees or the
money you charge from the user.

00:05:15.754 --> 00:05:17.170
Whereas a
noncontractual, the user

00:05:17.170 --> 00:05:20.140
can just bounce or churn
whenever he or she wants to.

00:05:20.140 --> 00:05:23.190
Stop playing a game, stop buying
your retail app, and so on.

00:05:23.190 --> 00:05:24.969
So this factor will
obviously influence

00:05:24.969 --> 00:05:27.010
the predictive analysis
as soon as you're talking

00:05:27.010 --> 00:05:29.290
about for instance revenues.

00:05:29.290 --> 00:05:31.600
Also, predictive
analysis will be

00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:33.890
influenced by the stage
in which you're in.

00:05:33.890 --> 00:05:37.090
So if you're a startup, and
you're very new to the market,

00:05:37.090 --> 00:05:39.100
you have to persuade
a lot of people

00:05:39.100 --> 00:05:40.900
that your startup is
actually a good idea.

00:05:40.900 --> 00:05:44.120
Investors, stakeholders,
your users, and so on.

00:05:44.120 --> 00:05:47.080
So you might make more
aggressive assumptions.

00:05:47.080 --> 00:05:50.320
That will reflect in your
predictive analysis model.

00:05:50.320 --> 00:05:51.917
If you're a mature
business, you've

00:05:51.917 --> 00:05:54.250
been around for a couple of
years, you know your market,

00:05:54.250 --> 00:05:56.800
you know your
users, you will take

00:05:56.800 --> 00:05:59.230
more conservative assumptions.

00:05:59.230 --> 00:06:01.480
That also influences.

00:06:01.480 --> 00:06:04.600
Now like I said in the
beginning, predictive analysis,

00:06:04.600 --> 00:06:07.870
that's just a theory because
it underlies lifetime value.

00:06:07.870 --> 00:06:10.450
It's the theory on
which this built.

00:06:10.450 --> 00:06:12.190
Why are we talking
about lifetime value?

00:06:12.190 --> 00:06:14.830
Why are we giving 45 minutes
of our time to lifetime value?

00:06:14.830 --> 00:06:17.200
And why is it the last
session of the day?

00:06:17.200 --> 00:06:19.070
Well, because it's
really important.

00:06:19.070 --> 00:06:21.850
So that's why you need to give
me your last bit of attention

00:06:21.850 --> 00:06:23.410
that you're having.

00:06:23.410 --> 00:06:26.320
Lifetime value makes
you understand the value

00:06:26.320 --> 00:06:28.644
that users have for you.

00:06:28.644 --> 00:06:30.310
It makes you understand
what revenue you

00:06:30.310 --> 00:06:31.690
will generate in the future.

00:06:31.690 --> 00:06:34.930
It makes you understand which
channels are the right channels

00:06:34.930 --> 00:06:35.890
to invest in.

00:06:35.890 --> 00:06:37.897
Where should you
put your resources.

00:06:37.897 --> 00:06:39.730
And what's actually
going to be the outcome.

00:06:39.730 --> 00:06:41.563
What's going to be the
dividend for yourself

00:06:41.563 --> 00:06:42.546
or for your investors?

00:06:47.380 --> 00:06:50.110
Those questions can give
you a whole lot of answers.

00:06:50.110 --> 00:06:53.010
A popular example is many
newspaper apps ask me

00:06:53.010 --> 00:06:56.350
should we invest in mobile web
or should we invest in apps?

00:06:56.350 --> 00:06:58.972
Well essentially, you should
think about lifetime value.

00:06:58.972 --> 00:06:59.680
It will help you.

00:06:59.680 --> 00:07:04.210
It's one of the metrics, but
it's a good one to look at.

00:07:04.210 --> 00:07:06.550
If you calculate lifetime
value, there are some pitfalls

00:07:06.550 --> 00:07:08.591
and I wanted to point them
out before we actually

00:07:08.591 --> 00:07:10.450
go into the math itself.

00:07:10.450 --> 00:07:15.250
First of all, make sure your
growth strategy is not just

00:07:15.250 --> 00:07:17.680
focused on maximizing
lifetime value.

00:07:17.680 --> 00:07:19.810
Like I said, it's one metric.

00:07:19.810 --> 00:07:23.180
But it should be rather
an effect than a cause.

00:07:23.180 --> 00:07:24.760
So lifetime value,
if it increases,

00:07:24.760 --> 00:07:26.230
it should be the
result of actions

00:07:26.230 --> 00:07:28.300
that you take on your
product, on your marketing

00:07:28.300 --> 00:07:30.400
strategy and your
communication strategy,

00:07:30.400 --> 00:07:32.230
and so on and so forth.

00:07:32.230 --> 00:07:37.210
Lifetime value should also not
be your competitive advantage.

00:07:37.210 --> 00:07:39.640
Let's assume you
have a lifetime value

00:07:39.640 --> 00:07:46.120
of $100, and your competitor,
why ever you know that has $50.

00:07:46.120 --> 00:07:49.094
Don't get lazy on that because
it's a temporary snapshot.

00:07:49.094 --> 00:07:51.760
So if you get lazy in the higher
lifetime value you get, and you

00:07:51.760 --> 00:07:55.100
don't continue to
develop for your users,

00:07:55.100 --> 00:07:57.820
this might have
bad repercussions.

00:07:57.820 --> 00:08:01.150
A second point is a too
optimistic lifetime value

00:08:01.150 --> 00:08:03.080
would lead you to an
excess in investment.

00:08:03.080 --> 00:08:04.330
And we all know what it means.

00:08:04.330 --> 00:08:06.670
That means you go
into the red numbers.

00:08:06.670 --> 00:08:10.120
Remember lifetime value
is based on assumptions.

00:08:10.120 --> 00:08:12.040
So assumptions can be wrong.

00:08:12.040 --> 00:08:14.797
And so a lifetime value
shouldn't be the only criteria,

00:08:14.797 --> 00:08:16.630
and you should look
into different scenarios

00:08:16.630 --> 00:08:17.629
and how to calculate it.

00:08:17.629 --> 00:08:20.330
Conservative versus aggressive.

00:08:20.330 --> 00:08:23.690
Let's make an example of
cost of acquiring customers.

00:08:23.690 --> 00:08:26.500
In theory, the cost
of acquiring customers

00:08:26.500 --> 00:08:30.299
could be equal to
lifetime value.

00:08:30.299 --> 00:08:32.049
If it's higher, you're
in the red numbers,

00:08:32.049 --> 00:08:32.890
which is a bad sign.

00:08:32.890 --> 00:08:35.640
Only very few investors
actually allow that if it's

00:08:35.640 --> 00:08:38.030
your growth strategy.

00:08:38.030 --> 00:08:41.559
A rule of thumb that was
told to us is 30% to 40%

00:08:41.559 --> 00:08:44.560
of your lifetime value should
be the maximum that you spend

00:08:44.560 --> 00:08:45.730
on custom acquisition costs.

00:08:45.730 --> 00:08:47.229
Now we get to the
calculation later.

00:08:47.229 --> 00:08:51.147
And there are some other
things to look out for,

00:08:51.147 --> 00:08:52.480
but that's the basic assumption.

00:08:52.480 --> 00:08:53.521
That's the rule of thumb.

00:08:56.250 --> 00:08:57.010
Maths.

00:08:57.010 --> 00:09:01.750
So the formula you
see here is the basis

00:09:01.750 --> 00:09:03.700
of every other
lifetime value formula

00:09:03.700 --> 00:09:05.770
you're going to find around.

00:09:05.770 --> 00:09:09.250
Lifetime value depends
on engagement, retention,

00:09:09.250 --> 00:09:09.850
monetization.

00:09:09.850 --> 00:09:12.670
I think it was Maxine who had
that on his slides as well.

00:09:12.670 --> 00:09:15.370
So he took my message
away, but it's true.

00:09:15.370 --> 00:09:17.140
It depends on those
three variables.

00:09:17.140 --> 00:09:19.590
Lifetime value, for
a certain period,

00:09:19.590 --> 00:09:25.000
equals lifetime times
average revenues per user.

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:27.430
Sounds very simple.

00:09:27.430 --> 00:09:30.830
Now let's look into the
different variables.

00:09:30.830 --> 00:09:33.410
First, the lifetime
value period.

00:09:33.410 --> 00:09:36.140
So the lifetime
value you're going

00:09:36.140 --> 00:09:38.360
to get out of your
equations will heavily

00:09:38.360 --> 00:09:41.540
depend on the time frame
for which you calculated.

00:09:41.540 --> 00:09:44.780
A user that has a certain
lifetime value for 180 days

00:09:44.780 --> 00:09:50.165
LTV calculation we have a very
different value for a 365 day

00:09:50.165 --> 00:09:53.330
lifetime period calculation.

00:09:53.330 --> 00:09:56.582
What factors influence your
lifetime period decision?

00:09:56.582 --> 00:09:58.540
Sorry, I'm going to say
LTV, because I'm really

00:09:58.540 --> 00:10:00.750
too lazy to say lifetime
value every time.

00:10:00.750 --> 00:10:03.530
So what factors influence this?

00:10:03.530 --> 00:10:07.360
First of all, the
business nature.

00:10:07.360 --> 00:10:10.100
Is your business nature
long or is it shorter?

00:10:10.100 --> 00:10:12.770
Is it an Olympic Games, which
is relevant for a couple

00:10:12.770 --> 00:10:16.250
of months, or is it in a
software as a service business,

00:10:16.250 --> 00:10:19.170
which users might be
using for years and years?

00:10:19.170 --> 00:10:20.840
Secondly, business model.

00:10:20.840 --> 00:10:24.460
Advertising, non contextual
business model, subscriptions,

00:10:24.460 --> 00:10:25.700
contextual business model.

00:10:25.700 --> 00:10:28.820
You'll choose a different
[INAUDIBLE] or period.

00:10:28.820 --> 00:10:31.370
And stage of company,
again will influence that.

00:10:31.370 --> 00:10:33.680
So startups tend to make
aggressive assumptions,

00:10:33.680 --> 00:10:37.276
so they go for a
longer lifecycle.

00:10:37.276 --> 00:10:39.150
Mature businesses would
go for a shorter one.

00:10:41.780 --> 00:10:46.110
La Matinale, on this example
has an average lifetime

00:10:46.110 --> 00:10:47.790
of their subscriptions
of 15 months.

00:10:47.790 --> 00:10:50.836
So that's the lifetime
variable, not the period.

00:10:50.836 --> 00:10:52.710
However, they decided
to calculate the period

00:10:52.710 --> 00:10:54.240
for one and for two years.

00:10:54.240 --> 00:10:55.260
Why do they do that?

00:10:55.260 --> 00:10:56.926
Because they want to
see how the numbers

00:10:56.926 --> 00:10:58.740
change between those two models.

00:10:58.740 --> 00:10:59.820
They funnel it together.

00:10:59.820 --> 00:11:01.980
They look at the aggregate,
and they take decisions

00:11:01.980 --> 00:11:03.900
based on the two
isolated to each other.

00:11:03.900 --> 00:11:07.650
That's for them to understand
how it actually differs.

00:11:07.650 --> 00:11:09.780
That's a nice example here.

00:11:09.780 --> 00:11:11.100
Lifetime calculation.

00:11:11.100 --> 00:11:12.810
Now, this curve.

00:11:12.810 --> 00:11:14.680
The retention, the
survival curve.

00:11:14.680 --> 00:11:19.290
So for lifetime,
retention is critical.

00:11:19.290 --> 00:11:22.080
Because it essentially
tells you the opportunities

00:11:22.080 --> 00:11:26.460
that you have to convert
a user into a pay user.

00:11:26.460 --> 00:11:29.640
So lifetimes also highly
correlated to engagement.

00:11:29.640 --> 00:11:31.980
Because the more engaged
the user is, the more likely

00:11:31.980 --> 00:11:35.670
he is to reach to be retained,
the more lifetime he will have.

00:11:35.670 --> 00:11:39.450
Again, there are very different
ways of calculating lifetime.

00:11:39.450 --> 00:11:42.030
Some very simple ones and
some very complex ones.

00:11:42.030 --> 00:11:44.430
We heard that before I, know.

00:11:44.430 --> 00:11:46.420
First, for the simple
model for instance,

00:11:46.420 --> 00:11:48.690
you would define
a moment of churn.

00:11:48.690 --> 00:11:50.790
When is churn actually
happening for you?

00:11:50.790 --> 00:11:55.260
Let's say you say if a
user is two weeks inactive,

00:11:55.260 --> 00:11:57.360
he's turned that's
my definition of it.

00:11:57.360 --> 00:11:59.820
Let's say you look
at your curves,

00:11:59.820 --> 00:12:01.410
and you find out
well on average,

00:12:01.410 --> 00:12:04.770
after six months that's when
users are getting inactive.

00:12:04.770 --> 00:12:05.910
Hence, that's my churn.

00:12:05.910 --> 00:12:09.780
And hence that's my
average lifetime.

00:12:09.780 --> 00:12:11.460
Now there are also
very complex ones

00:12:11.460 --> 00:12:13.620
which are based on
those survival curves.

00:12:13.620 --> 00:12:16.830
We're going to get to
that later, I promise.

00:12:16.830 --> 00:12:21.840
Lastly, our monetization
metric where prices come in.

00:12:21.840 --> 00:12:22.944
Average revenue per user.

00:12:22.944 --> 00:12:25.110
Now that's typically not
that difficult to determine

00:12:25.110 --> 00:12:28.740
because it's usually total
monthly revenues divided

00:12:28.740 --> 00:12:29.880
by monthly active users.

00:12:29.880 --> 00:12:31.650
Giving you the average
revenues per month.

00:12:31.650 --> 00:12:36.339
Make sure that you're
taking the right units.

00:12:36.339 --> 00:12:38.130
So you should have the
same units then when

00:12:38.130 --> 00:12:39.530
you do lifetime calculation.

00:12:43.050 --> 00:12:44.580
That's the basic
calculation of it.

00:12:44.580 --> 00:12:46.500
Now you might ask--
I have to drink in

00:12:46.500 --> 00:12:49.350
between because otherwise
I can't bear it.

00:12:49.350 --> 00:12:51.270
You might ask
yourself, what's cost?

00:12:51.270 --> 00:12:54.060
What about cost?

00:12:54.060 --> 00:12:56.760
Many developers in fact,
don't only look at revenues,

00:12:56.760 --> 00:12:58.590
they do look at costs as well.

00:12:58.590 --> 00:13:02.070
Because in real life you want
to know how your net lifetime

00:13:02.070 --> 00:13:03.610
value actually looks like.

00:13:03.610 --> 00:13:06.630
So what you would do is
typically top down method,

00:13:06.630 --> 00:13:10.020
you take the revenue you earned,
you deduct all variable costs,

00:13:10.020 --> 00:13:12.990
and you get into
variable contribution.

00:13:12.990 --> 00:13:15.990
So be aware that variable
contribution can vary

00:13:15.990 --> 00:13:18.139
for different user segments.

00:13:18.139 --> 00:13:19.680
And that's something
also to look at.

00:13:19.680 --> 00:13:21.300
Obviously, the more user
segments you define,

00:13:21.300 --> 00:13:22.716
and for the more
user segments you

00:13:22.716 --> 00:13:24.660
make this analysis,
the more tricky

00:13:24.660 --> 00:13:28.020
it will be in the end to
calculate your lifetime value.

00:13:28.020 --> 00:13:30.680
But it's worth it.

00:13:30.680 --> 00:13:35.190
Also you might ask yourself,
well if I am a very long cycle

00:13:35.190 --> 00:13:38.550
app, how should I do it
with future revenues that

00:13:38.550 --> 00:13:41.310
occur far out in the future?

00:13:41.310 --> 00:13:43.770
That's when the
discount rate comes in.

00:13:43.770 --> 00:13:45.960
So like some of you might
have learned in investment

00:13:45.960 --> 00:13:49.740
calculations, you
discount future cash flows

00:13:49.740 --> 00:13:51.540
into net present value.

00:13:51.540 --> 00:13:54.620
So that's very important because
if you think about the example,

00:13:54.620 --> 00:13:57.600
if you have 10 euros
today, those 10 euros

00:13:57.600 --> 00:14:01.050
won't buy you the same amount of
goods in five years, inflation.

00:14:01.050 --> 00:14:03.270
So that's something to take
into consideration here,

00:14:03.270 --> 00:14:05.476
because your investments
today will be impacted

00:14:05.476 --> 00:14:06.600
by those revenues tomorrow.

00:14:06.600 --> 00:14:09.300
In the best case scenario,
it would be refinanced.

00:14:09.300 --> 00:14:11.620
That's something to take
into account as well.

00:14:14.540 --> 00:14:16.650
So that's it for the theory.

00:14:16.650 --> 00:14:21.210
Like I said in the introduction,
we will take the theory first.

00:14:21.210 --> 00:14:24.030
And we will then apply
it into practice.

00:14:24.030 --> 00:14:30.550
Now as you see, I am a
passionate motor biker.

00:14:30.550 --> 00:14:32.450
You can see that here.

00:14:32.450 --> 00:14:33.840
I'm a very passionate
motorbiker.

00:14:33.840 --> 00:14:37.620
And together with
some of my biker pals,

00:14:37.620 --> 00:14:41.070
we came up with the
idea to develop an app,

00:14:41.070 --> 00:14:43.170
specifically for motorbikers.

00:14:43.170 --> 00:14:46.170
We want to showcase the
nicest routes across Europe,

00:14:46.170 --> 00:14:47.970
the nicest hotels,
the best places

00:14:47.970 --> 00:14:50.850
to drink your non-alcoholic
beers with your biker pals.

00:14:50.850 --> 00:14:53.280
So we came up with
this app idea.

00:14:53.280 --> 00:14:55.500
And we're
bootstrapping this app.

00:14:55.500 --> 00:14:57.310
Hence, we want to
know what's going

00:14:57.310 --> 00:14:58.560
to happen with our investment.

00:14:58.560 --> 00:15:01.770
And how can we refinance it
and where should we invest it.

00:15:01.770 --> 00:15:05.400
So in order to determine which
monetization model we choose,

00:15:05.400 --> 00:15:08.130
we talked to some contacts
we have across the industry,

00:15:08.130 --> 00:15:10.360
and we wanted to figure
out how they do it

00:15:10.360 --> 00:15:14.160
with their LTV calculations.

00:15:14.160 --> 00:15:17.940
First of all, we found that it's
essentially four pure business

00:15:17.940 --> 00:15:21.750
models and many hybrid
business models prevailing

00:15:21.750 --> 00:15:22.744
in the industry.

00:15:22.744 --> 00:15:24.660
You have premium apps,
you have subscriptions,

00:15:24.660 --> 00:15:27.226
you have in-app purchases
of freemium, you have ads,

00:15:27.226 --> 00:15:28.350
and you have hybrid models.

00:15:28.350 --> 00:15:31.260
In reality, hybrid models
are the most common ones

00:15:31.260 --> 00:15:33.330
in the industry.

00:15:33.330 --> 00:15:35.280
Let's start with premium.

00:15:35.280 --> 00:15:37.020
The good news is
premium is the easiest

00:15:37.020 --> 00:15:40.200
to calculate lifetime value
because your LTV essentially

00:15:40.200 --> 00:15:42.090
equals the price.

00:15:42.090 --> 00:15:44.250
Now the user acquisition
costs also tend

00:15:44.250 --> 00:15:47.760
to be very accurately calculated
because you can just base it

00:15:47.760 --> 00:15:49.990
on the LTV you're having,
or best case scenario

00:15:49.990 --> 00:15:51.780
on the net LTV [INAUDIBLE].

00:15:51.780 --> 00:15:54.560
Now that being said,
that is a priori.

00:15:54.560 --> 00:15:57.330
It means usually you
will have hybrid models

00:15:57.330 --> 00:16:00.210
especially with premium.

00:16:00.210 --> 00:16:02.730
We talked to some
contacts at Cameringo.

00:16:02.730 --> 00:16:06.540
And they're one of the
most popular photography

00:16:06.540 --> 00:16:08.260
apps in Play.

00:16:08.260 --> 00:16:10.530
So they're having a
premium business model.

00:16:10.530 --> 00:16:14.810
And they told us that the
price is the key for them

00:16:14.810 --> 00:16:16.140
and the price has to be right.

00:16:16.140 --> 00:16:18.840
You have to be able to offer the
user the exact price point he

00:16:18.840 --> 00:16:20.130
or she is willing to buy.

00:16:20.130 --> 00:16:23.860
They're doing loads of testing
around these two pounds

00:16:23.860 --> 00:16:28.070
99 using price elasticity
testing methods,

00:16:28.070 --> 00:16:32.130
using indices like the Big Mac
Index or certain purchasing

00:16:32.130 --> 00:16:35.400
power indexes in order
to set the right price.

00:16:35.400 --> 00:16:37.200
Also, for Cameringo
when it comes

00:16:37.200 --> 00:16:40.650
to maximizing lifetime
value, they're

00:16:40.650 --> 00:16:44.540
looking into two main things,
store ratings and reviews,

00:16:44.540 --> 00:16:46.150
and story listing.

00:16:46.150 --> 00:16:48.150
We heard a lot about those
topics already today,

00:16:48.150 --> 00:16:50.570
but this actually confirms it.

00:16:50.570 --> 00:16:53.670
If the moment of truth
comes, and the user

00:16:53.670 --> 00:16:56.520
is supposed to buy in
your app, before he's ever

00:16:56.520 --> 00:16:58.610
seen it or seen
anything that maybe

00:16:58.610 --> 00:17:00.990
a promotional video
or a screenshots,

00:17:00.990 --> 00:17:04.890
you have to have good ratings,
even more than any other model.

00:17:04.890 --> 00:17:09.900
And you have to have reviews
that give direct feedback.

00:17:09.900 --> 00:17:11.786
The best camera app
out there, period.

00:17:11.786 --> 00:17:12.619
I've tried them all.

00:17:12.619 --> 00:17:14.369
Go ahead, buy it.

00:17:14.369 --> 00:17:16.014
You like it.

00:17:16.014 --> 00:17:17.430
So they need those
kind of reviews

00:17:17.430 --> 00:17:21.040
because that's the word
of mouth that you need.

00:17:21.040 --> 00:17:22.829
So what are they
doing to optimize it?

00:17:22.829 --> 00:17:25.770
First of all, they are super
protective with custom service.

00:17:25.770 --> 00:17:28.924
It goes without saying they're
responding to bad reviews.

00:17:28.924 --> 00:17:30.590
They're also responding
to good reviews.

00:17:30.590 --> 00:17:34.370
But they're actionally it.

00:17:34.370 --> 00:17:35.520
That's tricky.

00:17:35.520 --> 00:17:38.460
So that means whenever they get
feedback, it's real feedback.

00:17:38.460 --> 00:17:39.660
So they worked on it.

00:17:39.660 --> 00:17:41.970
And whenever they
get praise, they

00:17:41.970 --> 00:17:44.730
ask the guy to keep up
with his engagement.

00:17:44.730 --> 00:17:47.460
Also they're trying to
maximize the ratings.

00:17:47.460 --> 00:17:49.710
So what they're doing is
the typical user prompt.

00:17:49.710 --> 00:17:52.260
But they don't just
prompt the user whenever.

00:17:52.260 --> 00:17:55.170
They look at loyal users
that they prompt first.

00:17:55.170 --> 00:17:58.020
They look at prompting them
only when they have good network

00:17:58.020 --> 00:18:00.810
coverage, so that they
can actually fill it out.

00:18:00.810 --> 00:18:03.060
They have a nice
mechanism in the message

00:18:03.060 --> 00:18:05.190
that the user, if they
doesn't want to be bothered

00:18:05.190 --> 00:18:07.580
can just click don't
bother me again.

00:18:07.580 --> 00:18:10.020
And they will try everything
not to annoy the user.

00:18:10.020 --> 00:18:12.579
Because nothing is worse than
being prompted the entire time,

00:18:12.579 --> 00:18:14.370
and in the end you're
like, OK, screw that.

00:18:14.370 --> 00:18:17.330
I'm going to give
you a one star.

00:18:17.330 --> 00:18:19.070
So that's very important.

00:18:19.070 --> 00:18:22.700
Also their store listing.

00:18:22.700 --> 00:18:24.307
They would never
use spot translators

00:18:24.307 --> 00:18:25.140
or Google translate.

00:18:25.140 --> 00:18:27.150
They would always use humans.

00:18:27.150 --> 00:18:30.510
Because in the end,
that has to be natural.

00:18:30.510 --> 00:18:32.970
Store listing experiments
is key ingredient.

00:18:32.970 --> 00:18:37.620
Fergus talked to beforehand,
talked about it beforehand.

00:18:37.620 --> 00:18:40.450
According to Cameringo,
actually the first time,

00:18:40.450 --> 00:18:42.390
they optimized
this entire funnel

00:18:42.390 --> 00:18:43.950
or this part of
the funnel, it led

00:18:43.950 --> 00:18:47.670
to a 25% increase in downloads.

00:18:47.670 --> 00:18:50.300
That's very interesting.

00:18:50.300 --> 00:18:54.430
Now we learned about premium.

00:18:54.430 --> 00:18:56.540
The next business model
we wanted to look at

00:18:56.540 --> 00:18:58.140
was the subscription business.

00:18:58.140 --> 00:19:00.180
Because we wanted
to take away this

00:19:00.180 --> 00:19:01.800
pay without having seen it.

00:19:01.800 --> 00:19:04.020
And wanted to increase
maybe installs.

00:19:04.020 --> 00:19:05.520
So we looked at subscriptions.

00:19:05.520 --> 00:19:09.320
Now a good friend of mine
explained me the following.

00:19:09.320 --> 00:19:12.560
In subscriptions, the
ARPU is straightforward

00:19:12.560 --> 00:19:13.980
because it's fixed.

00:19:13.980 --> 00:19:16.190
You're having your
monthly, your quarterly,

00:19:16.190 --> 00:19:18.660
your annual subscription,
and the rate is fixed.

00:19:18.660 --> 00:19:21.000
So you know that beforehand.

00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:22.830
The LTV and
subscriptions is really

00:19:22.830 --> 00:19:25.200
driven by lifetime,
which is equal to

00:19:25.200 --> 00:19:27.080
the average subscription rate.

00:19:27.080 --> 00:19:29.300
That again depends
on the renewal rates

00:19:29.300 --> 00:19:31.360
that you're having at
the end of the term.

00:19:31.360 --> 00:19:35.707
And that again depends on churn.

00:19:35.707 --> 00:19:37.040
I hope everybody's following me.

00:19:37.040 --> 00:19:40.380
So churn rates and
renewal rates are crucial.

00:19:40.380 --> 00:19:43.290
That's why lifetime
here in this example

00:19:43.290 --> 00:19:45.030
is 1 divided by churn ratio.

00:19:45.030 --> 00:19:45.960
So this changed.

00:19:45.960 --> 00:19:47.040
And it's very concrete.

00:19:47.040 --> 00:19:49.440
You have to have your
rate or your churn ratio,

00:19:49.440 --> 00:19:52.020
which is the opposite
of your renewal rates.

00:19:52.020 --> 00:19:54.830
Now ARPU is fixed.

00:19:54.830 --> 00:19:56.790
Lifetime is 1 divided
by churn ratio.

00:19:56.790 --> 00:19:58.800
What about the
lifetime value period?

00:19:58.800 --> 00:20:00.450
Now usually lifetime
value period

00:20:00.450 --> 00:20:03.240
should be your average
subscription length.

00:20:03.240 --> 00:20:05.040
Because you can
take this assumption

00:20:05.040 --> 00:20:06.457
a priority because
you know what's

00:20:06.457 --> 00:20:08.331
the average length
because you have this kind

00:20:08.331 --> 00:20:09.660
of contextual relationship.

00:20:09.660 --> 00:20:15.720
Now in practice, many of the
subscription-based developers

00:20:15.720 --> 00:20:17.940
or businesses would
also calculate

00:20:17.940 --> 00:20:21.380
based on 180 days
or 365 days, just

00:20:21.380 --> 00:20:26.460
like we've seen before in
the example with La Matinale.

00:20:26.460 --> 00:20:29.760
There are certain caveats to
calculating lifetime value

00:20:29.760 --> 00:20:32.300
for subscription-based apps.

00:20:35.120 --> 00:20:38.390
First, exclude free trials.

00:20:38.390 --> 00:20:40.470
Those are not revenues
so exclude them.

00:20:40.470 --> 00:20:43.590
Second, exclude any form
of promotional introductory

00:20:43.590 --> 00:20:45.240
pricing that you might be doing.

00:20:45.240 --> 00:20:47.430
Or at least take the
revenue that you're actually

00:20:47.430 --> 00:20:49.340
going to get from it.

00:20:49.340 --> 00:20:51.510
Secondly, segment by cohorts.

00:20:51.510 --> 00:20:55.424
It's worth it to compare the
different lifetimes that you're

00:20:55.424 --> 00:20:56.090
actually having.

00:20:56.090 --> 00:21:00.750
So the quarterly subscription
versus the annual at least.

00:21:00.750 --> 00:21:03.646
Thirdly, discount
future cash flows.

00:21:03.646 --> 00:21:05.520
Because you're having
a contractual business,

00:21:05.520 --> 00:21:07.170
your lifetime might
be much longer,

00:21:07.170 --> 00:21:10.640
hence you need to discount
the net present value.

00:21:10.640 --> 00:21:13.260
Fourth, crossplatform
attribution.

00:21:13.260 --> 00:21:16.150
Now let's take the example
of a newspaper app.

00:21:16.150 --> 00:21:18.140
Your business is
across many platforms.

00:21:18.140 --> 00:21:20.760
So you have to be able to
attribute for lifetime value

00:21:20.760 --> 00:21:22.640
across those platforms
to compare it.

00:21:22.640 --> 00:21:24.480
So that means you
should be measuring,

00:21:24.480 --> 00:21:27.720
in the best scenario, with the
same formula on mobile web,

00:21:27.720 --> 00:21:29.300
on apps, on desktop.

00:21:29.300 --> 00:21:31.850
What's the lifetime value
of the monetization forum

00:21:31.850 --> 00:21:34.230
that you're actually using?

00:21:34.230 --> 00:21:36.690
Take the formula, do it the
percentage in terms of usage,

00:21:36.690 --> 00:21:39.650
and you get an average to
have-- that's like as a basis.

00:21:39.650 --> 00:21:41.940
So measurement and
subscription app

00:21:41.940 --> 00:21:45.370
LTV equals subscription
fee times churn,

00:21:45.370 --> 00:21:48.570
which is subscription fee
times 1 divided by churn.

00:21:51.960 --> 00:21:54.690
There is an interesting
paradox for subscription apps.

00:21:54.690 --> 00:21:56.790
And I'm not sure how
many of you met it.

00:21:56.790 --> 00:21:59.570
And I'm not going to do
a show of hands again.

00:21:59.570 --> 00:22:02.650
It's the native churn paradox.

00:22:02.650 --> 00:22:06.110
So let's assume my
motorbike app only

00:22:06.110 --> 00:22:08.890
has two paying subscribers.

00:22:08.890 --> 00:22:11.970
One of them is Maxine,
my colleague here,

00:22:11.970 --> 00:22:15.350
who's a biker as well, and
the other is my girlfriend.

00:22:15.350 --> 00:22:18.129
Now for whatever reason,
Maxine decides after one year

00:22:18.129 --> 00:22:20.670
that he is not going to prolong
his subscription because he's

00:22:20.670 --> 00:22:22.610
sick and tired of motorbiking.

00:22:22.610 --> 00:22:25.530
So the only customer I
have left is my girlfriend.

00:22:25.530 --> 00:22:28.880
Now 50% of my revenue
in theory is gone

00:22:28.880 --> 00:22:32.630
and 50% of my users
in theory are gone.

00:22:32.630 --> 00:22:37.440
However, I managed to upsell to
super duper extraordinary VIP

00:22:37.440 --> 00:22:40.740
package to my
girlfriend for $10 more

00:22:40.740 --> 00:22:44.190
than the actual subscription
cost of Maxine was.

00:22:44.190 --> 00:22:47.760
I have 50% user
churn, but I have

00:22:47.760 --> 00:22:50.610
but I have 110% of revenue.

00:22:50.610 --> 00:22:53.010
So that's the native
churn paradox.

00:22:53.010 --> 00:22:56.617
You upsell to the users
that are the most engaged

00:22:56.617 --> 00:22:58.950
and renew their subscriptions
because you can offer them

00:22:58.950 --> 00:23:02.190
additional content that's worth
it for them to pay for it.

00:23:02.190 --> 00:23:05.340
And that's what most successful
software services or utilities

00:23:05.340 --> 00:23:07.310
apps are actually trying to do.

00:23:07.310 --> 00:23:10.200
Upselling to the
users that are core.

00:23:10.200 --> 00:23:11.060
Read up on that.

00:23:11.060 --> 00:23:14.060
I think it's a very
interesting framework.

00:23:14.060 --> 00:23:16.670
We're not going to go deeper
here, but read up on this.

00:23:19.470 --> 00:23:20.940
DramaFever.

00:23:20.940 --> 00:23:23.250
I talked to a guy at DramaFever.

00:23:23.250 --> 00:23:27.170
Korean TV series streaming app.

00:23:27.170 --> 00:23:31.530
And they analyze it in
very different cohorts

00:23:31.530 --> 00:23:34.170
when it comes to measuring
their lifetime value.

00:23:34.170 --> 00:23:36.630
They're looking at user
life, because for them it's

00:23:36.630 --> 00:23:40.546
really obvious that there is
a certain moment like after 1

00:23:40.546 --> 00:23:43.740
to 2 months of having
subscribed in the app,

00:23:43.740 --> 00:23:46.400
this user will stick
around forever.

00:23:46.400 --> 00:23:48.310
So they built this
loyalty fairly quickly.

00:23:48.310 --> 00:23:50.940
So they will look at
this point of time

00:23:50.940 --> 00:23:52.610
when they define their cohorts.

00:23:52.610 --> 00:23:54.990
They will also look
after for instance,

00:23:54.990 --> 00:23:58.670
churn via payment methods.

00:23:58.670 --> 00:24:01.740
Visa debit, Visa
credit, bank debit.

00:24:01.740 --> 00:24:04.530
This seems to have an
impact on their measurement.

00:24:04.530 --> 00:24:06.650
Think about it if
might have for yours.

00:24:06.650 --> 00:24:11.360
And they analyze monthly and
annual passes separately,

00:24:11.360 --> 00:24:13.290
because they see a
whole different lifetime

00:24:13.290 --> 00:24:15.940
value come around there.

00:24:15.940 --> 00:24:18.840
Some other interesting
points for DramaFever,

00:24:18.840 --> 00:24:21.220
churn rates are based
on the last three

00:24:21.220 --> 00:24:23.440
months, or the average
of the last three months.

00:24:23.440 --> 00:24:26.170
They don't take a very
short term metric like one

00:24:26.170 --> 00:24:29.352
month, just because of data
reliability and significance.

00:24:29.352 --> 00:24:31.060
And they don't take
very long churn rates

00:24:31.060 --> 00:24:33.143
because they're changing
the product continuously.

00:24:33.143 --> 00:24:34.830
So this will change as well.

00:24:34.830 --> 00:24:38.020
Secondly, they calculate
net lifetime value

00:24:38.020 --> 00:24:40.590
because they want
to know about cost.

00:24:40.590 --> 00:24:43.410
They apply at current rate
going to the net present value,

00:24:43.410 --> 00:24:45.780
because of the long cycle.

00:24:45.780 --> 00:24:48.190
They're trying not to
spend more than 30% to 40%

00:24:48.190 --> 00:24:51.082
of their LTV on custom
acquisition costs.

00:24:51.082 --> 00:24:52.540
So this kind of
confirms everything

00:24:52.540 --> 00:24:54.400
that I was saying before.

00:24:54.400 --> 00:24:58.180
But it's interesting to see
that being put in practice.

00:24:58.180 --> 00:25:00.330
Tactics that maximize
lifetime value.

00:25:00.330 --> 00:25:02.560
Now I think we've heard
a lot about tactics

00:25:02.560 --> 00:25:05.860
to maximize engagement
and retention already.

00:25:05.860 --> 00:25:07.510
They are essentially
the same tactics

00:25:07.510 --> 00:25:09.260
that you would apply
for LTV, because it's

00:25:09.260 --> 00:25:10.480
depending on those variables.

00:25:10.480 --> 00:25:13.660
Now for DramaFever,
interestingly free trials

00:25:13.660 --> 00:25:17.230
had little to no impact.

00:25:17.230 --> 00:25:19.090
On the opposite, it
actually sometimes had

00:25:19.090 --> 00:25:21.550
a negative impact, because
a user would download an app

00:25:21.550 --> 00:25:23.269
following a specific series.

00:25:23.269 --> 00:25:25.060
Now the season would
run out of that series

00:25:25.060 --> 00:25:28.000
before the user actually
ever had to pay for the app.

00:25:28.000 --> 00:25:30.060
So it backfired very often.

00:25:30.060 --> 00:25:34.390
DramaFever also tries to
make their promotions really

00:25:34.390 --> 00:25:35.330
impactful.

00:25:35.330 --> 00:25:37.451
So they're offering
very few promotions.

00:25:37.451 --> 00:25:39.700
But they're making sure that
if they offer promotions,

00:25:39.700 --> 00:25:43.300
they are very good promotions
and very appealing to the user.

00:25:43.300 --> 00:25:44.440
They offer multiple tiers.

00:25:44.440 --> 00:25:47.500
I think many subscription-based
apps do that.

00:25:47.500 --> 00:25:50.800
Giving different levels
of access and features

00:25:50.800 --> 00:25:53.200
to the different users,
and having different prices

00:25:53.200 --> 00:25:55.480
which they test for
any user segment

00:25:55.480 --> 00:25:56.710
that they might observe.

00:25:56.710 --> 00:26:00.160
As I mentioned before, they're
segmenting quite a lot.

00:26:00.160 --> 00:26:02.560
And two very important points.

00:26:02.560 --> 00:26:04.840
They're minimizing passive
churn and they're trying

00:26:04.840 --> 00:26:06.060
to discourage active churn.

00:26:06.060 --> 00:26:10.210
Now passive churn is churn
that users encounter because

00:26:10.210 --> 00:26:11.670
of some technical difficulty.

00:26:11.670 --> 00:26:14.260
Let's say your credit card has
expired, so you can't renew.

00:26:14.260 --> 00:26:16.300
Let's say you don't have
sufficient funds in your bank

00:26:16.300 --> 00:26:17.725
account, so you
won't be renewing.

00:26:17.725 --> 00:26:18.764
So that's passive churn.

00:26:18.764 --> 00:26:20.680
They're trying to have
really proactive custom

00:26:20.680 --> 00:26:24.430
service realizing as soon
as there is a complication

00:26:24.430 --> 00:26:25.630
and counteracting it.

00:26:25.630 --> 00:26:28.090
They're also trying to
discourage active churn, which

00:26:28.090 --> 00:26:31.390
is users just choosing not
to renew their subscriptions.

00:26:31.390 --> 00:26:33.310
How do they do that?

00:26:33.310 --> 00:26:37.300
They put special deals in front
of the user whose subscription

00:26:37.300 --> 00:26:38.770
will run out in
the next two weeks,

00:26:38.770 --> 00:26:40.735
and try to get him
back into the service.

00:26:45.730 --> 00:26:48.630
Next up, freemium.

00:26:48.630 --> 00:26:51.840
My pals and I were discussing
and we say all of the games

00:26:51.840 --> 00:26:53.740
are kind of doing
it, maybe we should

00:26:53.740 --> 00:26:57.310
look into them, in-app purchases
and making some of our content

00:26:57.310 --> 00:26:59.980
free and having to
use to pay for others.

00:26:59.980 --> 00:27:03.610
Now freemium apps,
LTV it depends

00:27:03.610 --> 00:27:05.470
a lot of end user engagement.

00:27:05.470 --> 00:27:09.460
And we see again the
survival curve here.

00:27:09.460 --> 00:27:12.409
When you talk about
lifetime for freemium apps,

00:27:12.409 --> 00:27:14.200
you're taking a slightly
different approach

00:27:14.200 --> 00:27:15.690
than with subscriptions.

00:27:15.690 --> 00:27:18.110
In the lifetime calculation
for freemium apps,

00:27:18.110 --> 00:27:21.300
you're picking reference
dates on the survival curve.

00:27:21.300 --> 00:27:25.380
You're picking one day for
instance, 7 days, and 28 days.

00:27:25.380 --> 00:27:27.760
You're then looking how
does my historical data

00:27:27.760 --> 00:27:31.180
for various user cohorts,
what data points do

00:27:31.180 --> 00:27:33.810
I get on those dates, on
those reference dates?

00:27:33.810 --> 00:27:35.230
You will get out
an equation which

00:27:35.230 --> 00:27:39.760
looks like the one up
there, where p is the day,

00:27:39.760 --> 00:27:41.800
and ABC are the coefficients.

00:27:41.800 --> 00:27:46.540
Now you will have lots
of various equations.

00:27:46.540 --> 00:27:48.190
So as the next
step, you're trying

00:27:48.190 --> 00:27:54.430
to get out the accumulative
deviation of those equations

00:27:54.430 --> 00:27:56.050
in order to get to an average.

00:27:56.050 --> 00:27:58.621
And that average will
be your lifetime.

00:27:58.621 --> 00:28:01.120
That sounds a little complex,
but in the end it makes sense.

00:28:01.120 --> 00:28:04.860
It's the accurate average
of your lifetime here.

00:28:04.860 --> 00:28:08.310
Now your ARPU, that will really
be depending on the units

00:28:08.310 --> 00:28:11.130
you sold during a certain
time, the price of the units

00:28:11.130 --> 00:28:12.280
you sold.

00:28:12.280 --> 00:28:15.670
So the calculation is
total average revenue

00:28:15.670 --> 00:28:17.950
in a period divided by
the active users you

00:28:17.950 --> 00:28:19.270
have in this period.

00:28:19.270 --> 00:28:22.540
Again, look at the
same time units please.

00:28:22.540 --> 00:28:26.340
Lastly, the period
usually is a standard.

00:28:26.340 --> 00:28:30.260
You're looking at 180 days, or
you're looking the 365 days.

00:28:30.260 --> 00:28:34.650
So it's fairly standard
because in the end

00:28:34.650 --> 00:28:37.420
you're having very flexible
churn dates, most presumably,

00:28:37.420 --> 00:28:41.950
in your non contractual
business model.

00:28:41.950 --> 00:28:44.209
So the formula, as we
have it, is the one

00:28:44.209 --> 00:28:46.000
that we actually saw
in the very beginning.

00:28:46.000 --> 00:28:51.570
LTV period equals
lifetime times ARPU.

00:28:51.570 --> 00:28:57.520
OkCupid is one of the biggest
dating apps in Google Play.

00:28:57.520 --> 00:28:59.890
They're actually using
two business models.

00:28:59.890 --> 00:29:02.314
So it's kind of a
hybrid app, but we're

00:29:02.314 --> 00:29:04.105
going to focus on in-app
purchases for them

00:29:04.105 --> 00:29:06.720
for the moment.

00:29:06.720 --> 00:29:09.970
OkCupid uses an in-house
customized formula.

00:29:09.970 --> 00:29:11.880
So we're not really
giving it on that slide,

00:29:11.880 --> 00:29:13.963
because it includes both
of those business models.

00:29:13.963 --> 00:29:17.100
However, there are certain
variables or certain let's say

00:29:17.100 --> 00:29:21.600
factors, that impact how to set
the variables in a crucial way.

00:29:21.600 --> 00:29:24.890
First of all, they're looking
at signals that show engagement.

00:29:24.890 --> 00:29:27.240
So if a user is in an
active messaging thread,

00:29:27.240 --> 00:29:30.190
if he's having conversations
with people in their app,

00:29:30.190 --> 00:29:31.440
that's a signal of engagement.

00:29:31.440 --> 00:29:33.420
So they would be
looking at those

00:29:33.420 --> 00:29:36.870
to define engagement,
retention, and churn rates.

00:29:36.870 --> 00:29:39.990
Secondly, they're also
looking at various cohorts.

00:29:39.990 --> 00:29:46.260
Again, OkCupid they look for
instance below 35 and above 35

00:29:46.260 --> 00:29:49.890
of age, because it shows that
there is major differences

00:29:49.890 --> 00:29:51.020
between those user cohorts.

00:29:51.020 --> 00:29:52.740
They're also looking
into genders,

00:29:52.740 --> 00:29:56.910
and they're also
looking at geographies.

00:29:56.910 --> 00:30:02.010
Lastly, they see that churn
levels typically are very high,

00:30:02.010 --> 00:30:05.530
but beyond the first usage,
retention gets a lot higher.

00:30:05.530 --> 00:30:09.870
So for them, their main job
is to actually get users

00:30:09.870 --> 00:30:12.061
over this first
week, because then

00:30:12.061 --> 00:30:14.352
that's where they get the
engagement that retains them.

00:30:17.610 --> 00:30:20.190
Now when it comes
to maximizing LTV,

00:30:20.190 --> 00:30:24.780
OkCupid told us that for
them, optimizing conversions

00:30:24.780 --> 00:30:28.000
for in-app purchases mainly
depends on a couple of factors.

00:30:28.000 --> 00:30:32.670
First of all, they're trying to
optimize creatives, messaging,

00:30:32.670 --> 00:30:34.770
calls to action
in their messages.

00:30:34.770 --> 00:30:37.220
On those prompts like
you see here, one of them

00:30:37.220 --> 00:30:39.720
they're trying to customize
that into a whole lot of testing

00:30:39.720 --> 00:30:42.789
for different cohorts, for
different geographies, genders,

00:30:42.789 --> 00:30:45.330
ages, and so on, in order to
get the best possible conversion

00:30:45.330 --> 00:30:46.830
rate.

00:30:46.830 --> 00:30:51.060
They're also trying to optimize
when they put the prompt based

00:30:51.060 --> 00:30:53.640
on the context in which
the user is in right now.

00:30:53.640 --> 00:30:56.780
So if you're in a
conversation, or if you're

00:30:56.780 --> 00:30:59.207
in the kind of who
visited my profile view,

00:30:59.207 --> 00:31:00.540
that's where you get the prompt.

00:31:00.540 --> 00:31:02.248
Because that's the
premium functionality,

00:31:02.248 --> 00:31:03.390
so they want to sell that.

00:31:03.390 --> 00:31:05.940
So that's how they put you
up to the miracle of who

00:31:05.940 --> 00:31:09.120
was the person who actually
viewed your profile.

00:31:09.120 --> 00:31:13.050
And again, also like
DramaFever beforehand,

00:31:13.050 --> 00:31:16.000
they're very selective
with the promotions.

00:31:16.000 --> 00:31:17.980
So they will only
offer promotions again,

00:31:17.980 --> 00:31:19.350
if they're on high impact.

00:31:19.350 --> 00:31:22.000
They typically give either
limited time, 48-hour maximum

00:31:22.000 --> 00:31:24.780
to give this kind of
urgency to the user.

00:31:24.780 --> 00:31:27.870
Or they do it with
a percentage off,

00:31:27.870 --> 00:31:30.600
in terms of 20% as a minimum.

00:31:30.600 --> 00:31:32.490
Usually quite
impactful promotions.

00:31:32.490 --> 00:31:35.900
With this kind of
testing, OkCupid

00:31:35.900 --> 00:31:40.520
claimed that they've increased
20% in purchases for their IPs.

00:31:43.650 --> 00:31:45.510
I think I'm going to
speed up a little bit.

00:31:45.510 --> 00:31:46.800
Ads.

00:31:46.800 --> 00:31:48.070
Ads, everybody's doing it.

00:31:48.070 --> 00:31:50.870
So we figured we'd
look into that.

00:31:50.870 --> 00:31:54.800
Now "The Guardian" gave us
some interesting insights here.

00:31:54.800 --> 00:31:58.705
Typically, they choose one year
as a period for lifetime value

00:31:58.705 --> 00:32:00.490
calculation because
it's a good way

00:32:00.490 --> 00:32:03.920
to find out if an investment
has actually has an ROI,

00:32:03.920 --> 00:32:05.515
and which projects
they should choose

00:32:05.515 --> 00:32:07.460
and which they should focus on.

00:32:07.460 --> 00:32:11.207
Lifetime is different
for ads monetization,

00:32:11.207 --> 00:32:13.540
because generally you're
interested in user impressions.

00:32:13.540 --> 00:32:15.612
Because every impression
on every screen

00:32:15.612 --> 00:32:17.570
gives you an opportunity
to monetize that user,

00:32:17.570 --> 00:32:18.910
as you know.

00:32:18.910 --> 00:32:23.470
So retention is important--
but this session like visits,

00:32:23.470 --> 00:32:25.330
sessions per visits,
screens per visit,

00:32:25.330 --> 00:32:30.340
and so on-- that is really the
key of lifetime calculations.

00:32:30.340 --> 00:32:33.880
"The Guardian" has a custom
formula, also in-house

00:32:33.880 --> 00:32:36.389
for this, where they essentially
look at those factors.

00:32:36.389 --> 00:32:38.680
And they're trying to get
kind of a normal distribution

00:32:38.680 --> 00:32:40.330
across all of those
factors in order

00:32:40.330 --> 00:32:41.930
to determine their lifetime.

00:32:41.930 --> 00:32:46.330
They won't share that formula,
but that's how they do it.

00:32:46.330 --> 00:32:48.950
ARPU, again, that's
different here.

00:32:48.950 --> 00:32:52.300
Because with ads, as you know,
the price varies quite a lot.

00:32:52.300 --> 00:32:56.110
It's based on the sales channel,
direct sales, indirect sales.

00:32:56.110 --> 00:32:57.100
The ads [INAUDIBLE].

00:32:57.100 --> 00:32:57.946
Is it a native ad?

00:32:57.946 --> 00:32:59.210
Is it an interstitial?

00:32:59.210 --> 00:33:00.490
It depends on the geographies.

00:33:00.490 --> 00:33:01.570
It depends on the buyers.

00:33:01.570 --> 00:33:04.387
It depends on the users you're
having, to the audiences,

00:33:04.387 --> 00:33:06.470
it depends on the context
of where the ads appear,

00:33:06.470 --> 00:33:07.460
and so on and so forth.

00:33:07.460 --> 00:33:10.060
So loads of different factors.

00:33:10.060 --> 00:33:12.250
Be aware, bring it
down to one price.

00:33:12.250 --> 00:33:13.570
That goes without saying.

00:33:13.570 --> 00:33:16.640
You have cost per day, cost
per mile, cost per whatever.

00:33:16.640 --> 00:33:20.890
Bring it down to
most commonly CPM.

00:33:20.890 --> 00:33:24.460
And then fit it
into your equation.

00:33:24.460 --> 00:33:29.500
Lifetime value period
maybe 360 days or 180 days

00:33:29.500 --> 00:33:34.000
equals lifetime times average
CPM times average number of ads

00:33:34.000 --> 00:33:36.130
per month.

00:33:36.130 --> 00:33:39.260
Again, that's the simple,
that's a basic formula.

00:33:39.260 --> 00:33:43.240
"The Guardian" adapts this one.

00:33:43.240 --> 00:33:44.680
Segment by cohorts.

00:33:44.680 --> 00:33:47.080
So "The Guardian" usually
takes four different cohorts

00:33:47.080 --> 00:33:50.740
for different user segments,
based on loyalty of those users

00:33:50.740 --> 00:33:54.280
and the number of
impressions they cost.

00:33:54.280 --> 00:33:56.800
Also the cohort, they
segment those cohorts

00:33:56.800 --> 00:33:58.402
into the geographies.

00:33:58.402 --> 00:34:00.610
And they're using the same
lifetime value calculation

00:34:00.610 --> 00:34:03.050
for mobile web and
for apps to compare.

00:34:06.700 --> 00:34:10.145
Last model of the day
and then we're done.

00:34:10.145 --> 00:34:11.520
That's by the way,
the last model

00:34:11.520 --> 00:34:13.960
is also where the bike
gets much more fancy.

00:34:13.960 --> 00:34:19.540
So hybrid models are arguably
the most complex models

00:34:19.540 --> 00:34:22.060
in life time value calculation
because you combine.

00:34:22.060 --> 00:34:25.000
You combine different formulas.

00:34:25.000 --> 00:34:27.500
Now many of the apps
and most of the apps

00:34:27.500 --> 00:34:29.530
do that because that's
how you maximize it.

00:34:29.530 --> 00:34:33.400
You try to have a certain
variety of monetization options

00:34:33.400 --> 00:34:35.469
that you give to your
user, because you

00:34:35.469 --> 00:34:38.920
want to actually let the user
choose what fits for him,

00:34:38.920 --> 00:34:40.909
what works for him or her.

00:34:40.909 --> 00:34:43.929
So here you see for
instance, a matrix

00:34:43.929 --> 00:34:46.060
that Wooga shared with us.

00:34:46.060 --> 00:34:48.159
Popular gaming developer.

00:34:48.159 --> 00:34:51.659
Now you can see on the
x-axis, progression

00:34:51.659 --> 00:34:52.870
of the player in the game.

00:34:52.870 --> 00:34:55.230
And on the y-axis,
the spending level.

00:34:55.230 --> 00:34:59.520
Now if a new player
comes in, and he

00:34:59.520 --> 00:35:03.720
plays for a very long time,
he ends up in that quadrant.

00:35:03.720 --> 00:35:07.007
That quadrant, Wooga will serve
him video interstitial apps

00:35:07.007 --> 00:35:08.590
because that's where
they get the best

00:35:08.590 --> 00:35:11.560
price as an apps monetizer,
because he never spent a dime

00:35:11.560 --> 00:35:13.200
on their in-app purchases.

00:35:13.200 --> 00:35:17.371
Now on the other hand,
if there is a new player

00:35:17.371 --> 00:35:19.620
installing and downloading,
downloading and installing

00:35:19.620 --> 00:35:23.020
the app, and he spends a lot
of money in very early stages,

00:35:23.020 --> 00:35:25.200
he will be immediately
offered VIP packages

00:35:25.200 --> 00:35:28.900
because that's where games
will try to upsell and include

00:35:28.900 --> 00:35:31.870
the user further and further.

00:35:31.870 --> 00:35:33.310
That's an interesting model.

00:35:33.310 --> 00:35:35.770
And I think it shows
very well, which

00:35:35.770 --> 00:35:40.140
user you would want to offer
which kind of monetization.

00:35:40.140 --> 00:35:42.360
Now I'm a big fan of
Ultimate Guitar Tabs,

00:35:42.360 --> 00:35:43.890
and we had a Hangout with them.

00:35:43.890 --> 00:35:46.020
For them, they combine
two business model.

00:35:46.020 --> 00:35:50.730
One premium and one
is in-app purchases.

00:35:50.730 --> 00:35:53.080
Premium, lifetime
value equals price.

00:35:53.080 --> 00:35:56.375
in-app purchases, they are
tiering it down as well.

00:35:56.375 --> 00:35:58.000
It's interesting
actually, they told us

00:35:58.000 --> 00:36:03.100
that they're having tiers
of $9.99, $7.99, and $2.99,

00:36:03.100 --> 00:36:06.644
depending on how long the
user has been having the app.

00:36:06.644 --> 00:36:09.060
Paid for it, downloaded, but
only using the basic version.

00:36:09.060 --> 00:36:11.520
So the longer you have it,
actually the cheaper it gets.

00:36:11.520 --> 00:36:15.700
It's interesting to remember
if any of you play the guitar.

00:36:15.700 --> 00:36:17.710
They claim that 40% of
the users are actually

00:36:17.710 --> 00:36:20.620
upgrading within the app.

00:36:20.620 --> 00:36:25.390
And 65% of their revenues come
from the in-app purchases.

00:36:25.390 --> 00:36:27.480
That's an interesting number.

00:36:27.480 --> 00:36:30.040
They say that 20% of
their premium upgrades

00:36:30.040 --> 00:36:31.440
occur in the on-boarding stage.

00:36:31.440 --> 00:36:35.640
So two hours after downloading
and installing the app,

00:36:35.640 --> 00:36:37.660
they then get the
VIP branding in.

00:36:37.660 --> 00:36:40.220
They give the user an
insight into which content

00:36:40.220 --> 00:36:43.720
he will be able to consume
after he paid for the premium

00:36:43.720 --> 00:36:44.730
segment.

00:36:44.730 --> 00:36:49.230
That increased their in-app
purchase conversion by 53%.

00:36:49.230 --> 00:36:51.170
They again also
adjust the prices

00:36:51.170 --> 00:36:54.730
per country using those indices
that I mentioned before,

00:36:54.730 --> 00:36:56.580
plus 8% in downloads.

00:36:56.580 --> 00:36:59.996
And again, store listing,
it's like a message

00:36:59.996 --> 00:37:01.620
we're trying to hammer
into your heads.

00:37:01.620 --> 00:37:04.930
But store listing experiments
for them is very critical,

00:37:04.930 --> 00:37:09.520
localizing the entire funnel
makes them more successful.

00:37:09.520 --> 00:37:11.460
14% increase in downloads.

00:37:14.020 --> 00:37:15.810
So theory?

00:37:15.810 --> 00:37:16.480
Check.

00:37:16.480 --> 00:37:17.100
Practices?

00:37:17.100 --> 00:37:17.770
Check.

00:37:17.770 --> 00:37:21.700
Five business models that
I discussed right now.

00:37:21.700 --> 00:37:23.430
There's a lot of information.

00:37:23.430 --> 00:37:28.750
And for me and my pals, in
developing this app now,

00:37:28.750 --> 00:37:31.274
we first have to kind of get
our heads together and think

00:37:31.274 --> 00:37:33.190
a little bit what we do
with that information.

00:37:33.190 --> 00:37:35.140
Crunch some numbers
in order to be

00:37:35.140 --> 00:37:37.556
able to choose which
monetization we want to do,

00:37:37.556 --> 00:37:39.930
and where we want to invest
our money, and which segments

00:37:39.930 --> 00:37:41.730
we want to invest our money in.

00:37:41.730 --> 00:37:45.040
But I think for us and
for you as well, there

00:37:45.040 --> 00:37:50.410
are three main takeaways
of that presentation.

00:37:50.410 --> 00:37:54.140
First of all, lifetime value
is not an end in itself.

00:37:54.140 --> 00:37:56.200
It's not a strategy.

00:37:56.200 --> 00:37:59.766
When you calculate lifetime
value, be realistic.

00:37:59.766 --> 00:38:02.140
Make sure that you take into
account the cost that you're

00:38:02.140 --> 00:38:03.600
actually having, variable cost.

00:38:03.600 --> 00:38:06.639
Make sure you're discounting
if you have a long sales cycle.

00:38:06.639 --> 00:38:08.430
And make sure that your
cost of acquisition

00:38:08.430 --> 00:38:10.350
is at a fairly decent level.

00:38:10.350 --> 00:38:12.810
Secondly, the formula.

00:38:12.810 --> 00:38:17.370
Lifetime value depends on
your lifetime times your ARPU,

00:38:17.370 --> 00:38:19.080
the basis of everything.

00:38:19.080 --> 00:38:22.690
Thirdly, and that's where
I have to agree if Nico,

00:38:22.690 --> 00:38:25.890
engagement is the new
black because engagement

00:38:25.890 --> 00:38:30.760
is the metric that is much
harder to optimize than ARPUs.

00:38:30.760 --> 00:38:35.440
So if you get to a high
engagement and high retention,

00:38:35.440 --> 00:38:36.890
and a low churn
rate, that's where

00:38:36.890 --> 00:38:38.140
you're going to be successful.

00:38:38.140 --> 00:38:39.430
So work on that.

00:38:39.430 --> 00:38:42.167
And then you optimize
for monetization.

00:38:42.167 --> 00:38:43.000
Thank you very much.

00:38:46.000 --> 00:38:49.350
