00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:04.750
Okay. Let's get started with Knowledge PCI. Today we'll talk about

00:00:04.750 --> 00:00:09.910
semantic networks. This is the kind of knowledge representation scheme. This is

00:00:09.910 --> 00:00:14.970
the first lesson in our fundamental topics part of the course. We'll start

00:00:14.970 --> 00:00:18.950
talking about knowledge representations, then we'll focus on semantic networks.

00:00:19.950 --> 00:00:24.470
We'll illustrate how semantic networks can be used to address two by one matrix

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:30.716
problems. You can think of this like a represent and reason modality.

00:00:30.716 --> 00:00:35.822
Represent the knowledge, represent the problem, then use that knowledge to

00:00:35.822 --> 00:00:41.980
address the problem. As simple as that. At the end, we'll close this lesson

00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:45.800
by connecting this topic with human cognition and with modern research in AI.
