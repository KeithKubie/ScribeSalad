00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:01.980
My name is Gregor Mendel, and I think

00:00:01.980 --> 00:00:05.000
I can explain what Hypocrites' blending inheritance model cannot.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:06.840
&gt;&gt; Okay how's that?

00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:10.300
&gt;&gt; Well, as a monk, I have quite a bit of quiet time, so I did some breeding

00:00:10.300 --> 00:00:13.590
experiments with pea plants that were published in 1866,

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:16.170
which I think have some serious implications on human traits.

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:17.960
&gt;&gt; Well, what was your model called?

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:23.290
&gt;&gt; I call it Particulate inheritance.

00:00:23.290 --> 00:00:25.650
Particulate inheritance means that characteristics can

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:28.010
be passed down from generation to generation through

00:00:28.010 --> 00:00:31.250
individual units. I believe you call them genes nowadays?

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:35.480
&gt;&gt; Wow! I can't believe you figured all that out using just pea plants!

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:40.130
&gt;&gt; Why does everybody doubt the pea plants? Think about organisms collection

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:43.460
of genes, being more like a deck of cards rather than a pail

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:46.660
of paint. A red and white paint can be mixed and the result

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:51.100
would be pink, but passing that down, you'll never get true red again.

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:53.370
Genes are more like cards, that can be sorted and

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:58.790
passed along, generation after generation in an undiluted form. Sometimes,

00:00:58.790 --> 00:01:00.720
the cards can be covered up so that they don't

00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:03.570
appear at all until they're passed down to the following generation.

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:06.830
&gt;&gt; That's a pretty clever description. Which

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:08.550
of the following examples do you think

00:01:08.550 --> 00:01:11.500
can be explained by particulate, but not

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:14.260
blended inheritance? Check all the boxes that apply.
