00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.606
All right.
We are in the middle of acids

00:00:19.606 --> 00:00:24.448
and bases.
And we are just going to finish

00:00:24.448 --> 00:00:30.000
up the handout from Monday,
starting first.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:36.000
And we were talking about
relative strengths of acids.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:48.411
If you have an equation such as
this, there is acid-base

00:00:48.411 --> 00:00:52.723
chemistry going on in both
directions.

00:00:52.723 --> 00:00:59.251
In the forward direction,
HNO three is acting as

00:00:59.251 --> 00:01:02.933
the acid.
It is giving up its hydrogen

00:01:02.933 --> 00:01:05.211
ion or proton to NH three.

00:01:05.211 --> 00:01:08.802
And when it gives it up,
it is forming its conjugate,

00:01:08.802 --> 00:01:12.254
NH three minus.
And when NH three

00:01:12.254 --> 00:01:15.776
accepts a hydrogen atom or
proton, it is forming its

00:01:15.776 --> 00:01:18.400
conjugate acid,
NH four plus.

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:22.335
That is what is happening in
the forward direction of this

00:01:22.335 --> 00:01:24.821
reaction.
In the reverse direction of

00:01:24.821 --> 00:01:27.514
this reaction,
NH four plus is

00:01:27.514 --> 00:01:32.196
acting as the acid.
It is giving up a proton to NH

00:01:32.196 --> 00:01:35.858
three minus.
When it gives up the proton,

00:01:35.858 --> 00:01:39.154
it is forming NH three,
the conjugate.

00:01:39.154 --> 00:01:42.669
And when this accepts the
hydrogen ion or proton,

00:01:42.669 --> 00:01:45.012
it is forming its conjugate
acid.

00:01:45.012 --> 00:01:47.502
In this direction this is the
acid.

00:01:47.502 --> 00:01:50.797
And in the reverse direction
this is the acid.

00:01:50.797 --> 00:01:55.045
You can predict something about
where the equilibrium lies,

00:01:55.045 --> 00:01:59.000
whether it is to the right or
the left.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:03.062
If you have a big K or a small
K for this reaction based on

00:02:03.062 --> 00:02:06.985
whether this is the stronger
acid or this is the stronger

00:02:06.985 --> 00:02:09.297
acid.
If this is the stronger acid

00:02:09.297 --> 00:02:11.888
the equilibrium will lie to the
right.

00:02:11.888 --> 00:02:15.881
If this is a stronger acid the
equilibrium will lie to the

00:02:15.881 --> 00:02:18.193
left.
And so we can take a look at

00:02:18.193 --> 00:02:22.185
this and work out which is the
stronger acid and where the

00:02:22.185 --> 00:02:24.987
equilibrium lies.
Here is the equilibrium

00:02:24.987 --> 00:02:30.466
constant for this reaction.
Again, it would be products

00:02:30.466 --> 00:02:34.302
over reactants.
And so to find this number,

00:02:34.302 --> 00:02:39.235
we can work through it by
getting information about the

00:02:39.235 --> 00:02:44.259
the Ka or acid ionization
constant for this acid and for

00:02:44.259 --> 00:02:47.822
this acid.
We can consider the reactions

00:02:47.822 --> 00:02:51.567
separately.
We can consider this acting as

00:02:51.567 --> 00:02:56.591
an acid and also this one.
Let's start here and consider

00:02:56.591 --> 00:03:01.889
the forward direction of the
reaction and consider how good

00:03:01.889 --> 00:03:08.765
an acid HNO three is.
You all should be able to write

00:03:08.765 --> 00:03:13.940
reactions of acid in water or
bases in water and figure out

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:17.598
what the products are going to
be of that.

00:03:17.598 --> 00:03:22.862
If we have NH three in
water then we are going to be

00:03:22.862 --> 00:03:28.304
forming hydronium ion and the
conjugate base of this conjugate

00:03:28.304 --> 00:03:32.009
acid here.
And then we can write a Ka.

00:03:32.009 --> 00:03:36.476
And it is a Ka because we are
talking about an acid in water.

00:03:36.476 --> 00:03:41.091
The Ka is going to be equal to
the products over the reactants.

00:03:41.091 --> 00:03:45.483
And here water is not included
because it is the solvent and

00:03:45.483 --> 00:03:49.950
its concentration really isn't
changing through the course of

00:03:49.950 --> 00:03:52.555
this reaction.
And we can look up an

00:03:52.555 --> 00:03:56.277
equilibrium constant for this
acid, and that is 20.

00:03:56.277 --> 00:04:00.000
Is that a strong acid or a weak
acid?

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:03.427
How did we define strong acid
last time?

00:04:03.427 --> 00:04:06.678
It was a Ka if it is greater
than one.

00:04:06.678 --> 00:04:10.896
20 is greater than one,
so this is a strong acid.

00:04:10.896 --> 00:04:15.642
Now we can do the same thing
for the reverse direction.

00:04:15.642 --> 00:04:19.948
In the reverse direction,
the acid is NH four plus.

00:04:19.948 --> 00:04:23.024
We can write NH four plus

00:04:23.024 --> 00:04:27.330
in water.
And that would go to hydronium

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:31.810
ions.
And the conjugate of this acid,

00:04:31.810 --> 00:04:36.072
which is NH three.
We can write out a Ka

00:04:36.072 --> 00:04:40.333
expression for this.
Again, it would be products

00:04:40.333 --> 00:04:43.144
over reactants.
And here the Ka,

00:04:43.144 --> 00:04:46.680
which could be looked up,
is 5.6x10^-10.

00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:51.213
Is that a strong or weak acid?
That is a weak acid,

00:04:51.213 --> 00:04:54.658
so the Ka is quite a bit less
than one.

00:04:54.658 --> 00:05:00.098
Already we can predict that for
this overall reaction it will

00:05:00.098 --> 00:05:05.219
lie to the right.
This is a much stronger acid

00:05:05.219 --> 00:05:08.708
than this one.
We can prove that that is true

00:05:08.708 --> 00:05:13.306
by using these two Ka values to
get the overall equilibrium

00:05:13.306 --> 00:05:18.301
constant for this reaction here.
If we took those two individual

00:05:18.301 --> 00:05:21.869
reactions that we wrote out and
subtract them,

00:05:21.869 --> 00:05:25.833
we can get our overall
expression for the reaction.

00:05:25.833 --> 00:05:30.273
And if we subtract them then we
can come up with the K by

00:05:30.273 --> 00:05:34.000
dividing the Ka's from each
other.

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:37.875
Remember we talked about Ks,
if you add together you

00:05:37.875 --> 00:05:41.674
multiply, if you subtract
reactions you can divide?

00:05:41.674 --> 00:05:46.386
And so we could prove that this
is true, that if we have the Ka

00:05:46.386 --> 00:05:50.565
up here and the Ka down here,
it will cancel to form the

00:05:50.565 --> 00:05:54.136
equilibrium expression for the
overall reaction.

00:05:54.136 --> 00:05:59.000
And we can substitute our Ka's
in, 20 over 5.6x10^-10.

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:03.029
And we get a K for the overall
reaction of 3.6x10^10,

00:06:03.029 --> 00:06:07.292
which is an enormous number.
And so this would lie very,

00:06:07.292 --> 00:06:10.160
very far to the right.
This is a much,

00:06:10.160 --> 00:06:13.725
much stronger acid than NH four
plus.

00:06:13.725 --> 00:06:17.677
If you know something,
if you have acid-base on both

00:06:17.677 --> 00:06:22.095
sides of the equilibrium and you
know about the strengths,

00:06:22.095 --> 00:06:26.125
you could predict where the
equilibrium of an overall

00:06:26.125 --> 00:06:30.000
reaction is going to lie.
All right.

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:32.721
This is still on the handout
from Monday.

00:06:32.721 --> 00:06:36.122
We mentioned that there are
five different types of

00:06:36.122 --> 00:06:40.408
acid-base problems that you are
going to encounter in this unit.

00:06:40.408 --> 00:06:44.625
And there are problems of salt
and water, which we are going to

00:06:44.625 --> 00:06:48.571
see today break down to a weak
acid or a weak base in water

00:06:48.571 --> 00:06:51.020
problem.
It is really not a different

00:06:51.020 --> 00:06:54.489
type of problem at all.
There is weak acid in water,

00:06:54.489 --> 00:06:56.870
weak base, strong acid,
strong base,

00:06:56.870 --> 00:07:01.692
and there are buffer problems.
And when we do titrations it

00:07:01.692 --> 00:07:04.048
will seem like that is a
different kind,

00:07:04.048 --> 00:07:06.768
but it also breaks down into
these categories.

00:07:06.768 --> 00:07:10.393
One trick that I have learned
from teaching this for a number

00:07:10.393 --> 00:07:13.596
of years is to get people
starting to think about what

00:07:13.596 --> 00:07:17.161
type of problem it is whenever
they see it and figuring out,

00:07:17.161 --> 00:07:19.760
then, they know how to address
that problem.

00:07:19.760 --> 00:07:22.962
Always be thinking about what
type of problem is this,

00:07:22.962 --> 00:07:25.077
and so how do I go about
solving it.

00:07:25.077 --> 00:07:28.099
We are going to look at the
first, number one here,

00:07:28.099 --> 00:07:35.181
a weak acid in water problem.
And the weak acid that I picked

00:07:35.181 --> 00:07:42.330
to look at is vitamin C.
In this particular problem we

00:07:42.330 --> 00:07:50.288
are going to ask what the pH
would be if I take this vitamin

00:07:50.288 --> 00:07:57.841
C tablet, a 50 mg tablet,
and put it into 100 milliliters

00:07:57.841 --> 00:08:01.810
of water.
And usually when you try to

00:08:01.810 --> 00:08:05.298
swallow vitamin tablets you try
not to dissolve them,

00:08:05.298 --> 00:08:08.115
but if we did then we could
look at the pH.

00:08:08.115 --> 00:08:11.804
I actually tried to do the
calculation and do the actual

00:08:11.804 --> 00:08:15.426
experiment one year and
discovered that these vitamin C

00:08:15.426 --> 00:08:19.585
tablets are coated really well.
You cannot get them to dissolve

00:08:19.585 --> 00:08:22.402
very easily.
That is because you don't want

00:08:22.402 --> 00:08:25.353
the bad taste in your mouth.
Nature's Bounty,

00:08:25.353 --> 00:08:29.378
if you don't want this table to
dissolve in your mouth before

00:08:29.378 --> 00:08:33.000
you swallow it,
I guarantee it won't.

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:37.452
You have to go to extreme
lengths to get this to dissolve

00:08:37.452 --> 00:08:40.951
in your mouth.
We cannot actually measure the

00:08:40.951 --> 00:08:44.608
pH of this because it is not
going to dissolve,

00:08:44.608 --> 00:08:49.220
the coating is pretty good,
but we can do the calculations,

00:08:49.220 --> 00:08:53.831
if the coating was less good,
what the pH of that would be.

00:08:53.831 --> 00:08:57.091
All right.
The first thing we need to know

00:08:57.091 --> 00:09:00.915
is molarity.
And so you can do this

00:09:00.915 --> 00:09:03.875
calculation.
You know the number of

00:09:03.875 --> 00:09:06.575
milligrams.
Convert it to grams.

00:09:06.575 --> 00:09:11.625
Look up the molecular weight.
Calculate how many moles that

00:09:11.625 --> 00:09:14.411
is.
And then that number of moles

00:09:14.411 --> 00:09:17.546
in your 0.1 liters or 100
milligrams.

00:09:17.546 --> 00:09:22.422
And you can get the molarity of
a vitamin C tablet in 100

00:09:22.422 --> 00:09:26.688
milliliters of water.
Then you would need to write

00:09:26.688 --> 00:09:32.000
the equation for a weak acid in
water problem.

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:35.875
And so here is our weak acid in
water.

00:09:35.875 --> 00:09:41.006
It is forming hydronium ions
and a conjugate base.

00:09:41.006 --> 00:09:46.662
Then you can set this up and
figure out what happens as

00:09:46.662 --> 00:09:52.945
initially the change and then
what the concentration would be

00:09:52.945 --> 00:09:57.658
at equilibrium.
In the beginning you just have

00:09:57.658 --> 00:10:03.000
this molarity,
the 0.0284 molar solution.

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:06.830
And you don't have any of these
initially.

00:10:06.830 --> 00:10:11.595
The change would be minus x and
then plus x, plus x.

00:10:11.595 --> 00:10:14.958
At equilibrium,
we're 0.0284 minus x,

00:10:14.958 --> 00:10:18.508
and, again, plus x.
Now to solve for x,

00:10:18.508 --> 00:10:23.553
which is what we want to solve,
we want to find out pH.

00:10:23.553 --> 00:10:30.000
And pH is the minus log of the
hydronium ion concentration.

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:33.579
We need to find x to be able to
find pH.

00:10:33.579 --> 00:10:37.433
And to get x,
we can do that if we know the

00:10:37.433 --> 00:10:41.563
Ka for the solution,
write out the expression,

00:10:41.563 --> 00:10:45.142
hydronium ion,
conjugate base over acid,

00:10:45.142 --> 00:10:50.556
we are leaving out the water
again, that would be equal to x

00:10:50.556 --> 00:10:55.604
squared, 0.0284 minus x.
Now

00:10:55.604 --> 00:11:01.262
we can try an assumption.
And this will be useful to you

00:11:01.262 --> 00:11:03.827
on exams.
First you can try to say,

00:11:03.827 --> 00:11:07.296
what if x was really small?
What if x was much,

00:11:07.296 --> 00:11:11.746
much smaller than this 0.0284?
Then this term just collapses

00:11:11.746 --> 00:11:15.065
into the number.
You can make that assumption

00:11:15.065 --> 00:11:19.515
and try it and see if it works.
And I will tell you what the

00:11:19.515 --> 00:11:23.739
rule will be to check that out.
If we try the assumption,

00:11:23.739 --> 00:11:27.058
then we have just x squared
over this number.

00:11:27.058 --> 00:11:32.183
That is easier to solve.
And we can solve for x.

00:11:32.183 --> 00:11:36.170
Here x is 0.00151.
And I am

00:11:36.170 --> 00:11:39.588
carrying an extra significant
figure.

00:11:39.588 --> 00:11:44.430
Then we can go and check,
is this true that that is,

00:11:44.430 --> 00:11:47.373
in fact, much smaller than
this?

00:11:47.373 --> 00:11:50.696
And the rule that we will use
is 5%.

00:11:50.696 --> 00:11:54.683
You can calculate whether the
number is 5%.

00:11:54.683 --> 00:12:00.000
Take x over your initial number
times 100%.

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:01.898
In this case,
it was 5.3%,

00:12:01.898 --> 00:12:05.468
which is more than 5%,
and so you should use the

00:12:05.468 --> 00:12:07.974
quadratic equation to solve for
x.

00:12:07.974 --> 00:12:12.075
Most of you normally use
calculators, which there is no

00:12:12.075 --> 00:12:15.265
problem in doing quadratic.
But, of course,

00:12:15.265 --> 00:12:19.594
the calculators we use on the
exams are not so amenable to

00:12:19.594 --> 00:12:22.025
doing this.
I suggest on an exam,

00:12:22.025 --> 00:12:26.506
you always try the assumption
that you can make it a simpler

00:12:26.506 --> 00:12:31.195
problem to save yourself time.
The rule is 5%.

00:12:31.195 --> 00:12:35.497
It has to be less than 5%.
I will just mention that the

00:12:35.497 --> 00:12:40.596
book talks about this expression
and refers to percent ionized to

00:12:40.596 --> 00:12:43.384
percent deprotonated.
This equation,

00:12:43.384 --> 00:12:47.368
which is really x over the
number minus the initial

00:12:47.368 --> 00:12:50.953
molarity minus x,
is how much you have gone to

00:12:50.953 --> 00:12:55.494
that side of the equation,
how much you have deprotonated,

00:12:55.494 --> 00:13:01.553
what the percent ionization is.
You will see those terms in the

00:13:01.553 --> 00:13:05.837
problem set and in the book.
If you use the quadratic

00:13:05.837 --> 00:13:10.615
equation then you get 0.00147.
And we are still carrying an

00:13:10.615 --> 00:13:15.146
extra significant figure.
That is really two significant

00:13:15.146 --> 00:13:18.359
figures.
The Ka just had two significant

00:13:18.359 --> 00:13:21.654
figures that were given.
If we now solve,

00:13:21.654 --> 00:13:25.938
this is x when x was the
hydronium ion concentration,

00:13:25.938 --> 00:13:30.304
so pH is minus log of the
hydronium ion concentration,

00:13:30.304 --> 00:13:35.000
which would be 2.83.

00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:38.465
And since this was really two
significant figures,

00:13:38.465 --> 00:13:42.709
now you have two significant
figures after the decimal point.

00:13:42.709 --> 00:13:46.529
That would be the correct
significant figure number for

00:13:46.529 --> 00:13:48.934
this.
Remember this 5% rule to make

00:13:48.934 --> 00:13:51.834
your life easier,
and also in all of these

00:13:51.834 --> 00:13:55.512
problems you want to pay
attention to the significant

00:13:55.512 --> 00:13:58.058
figures.
Again, the rules for logs in

00:13:58.058 --> 00:14:02.302
significant figures are a little
complicated and require some

00:14:02.302 --> 00:14:04.704
thought.
All right.

00:14:04.704 --> 00:14:07.591
That is a weak acid in water
type problem.

00:14:07.591 --> 00:14:11.746
And the weak base is going to
be very, very similar to that.

00:14:11.746 --> 00:14:16.112
And so today we are going to be
going on and talking about weak

00:14:16.112 --> 00:14:18.718
bases.
We are going to talk about salt

00:14:18.718 --> 00:14:21.535
solutions.
And I will try to prove to you

00:14:21.535 --> 00:14:26.042
that salt solution problems just
break down to weak acid problems

00:14:26.042 --> 00:14:29.000
and weak base problems.
Yeah?

00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:36.000
No, that is the same X.

00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:47.332
It is just a question of this,
is it smaller than the number,

00:14:47.332 --> 00:14:49.859
so back here,
it's not that it is an

00:14:49.859 --> 00:14:53.108
incredibly small number.
It is just within the

00:14:53.108 --> 00:14:57.296
significant figures smaller than
this number so that if you

00:14:57.296 --> 00:15:01.483
subtracted it from that number
it would not really make any

00:15:01.483 --> 00:15:03.000
difference.

00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:11.000
This one?

00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:25.474
This is the assumption that the
number x is going to be enough

00:15:25.474 --> 00:15:30.769
smaller than 0.028 that if you
subtracted x from that number

00:15:30.769 --> 00:15:34.000
you would still get that number.

00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:41.090
Here you are getting plus x.

00:15:41.090 --> 00:15:43.796
You are forming this amount of
hydronium ion,

00:15:43.796 --> 00:15:47.239
this amount of the conjugate,
and that is the same amount

00:15:47.239 --> 00:15:50.867
that is forming here that what
you are taking away from your

00:15:50.867 --> 00:15:53.019
initial over here.
It is the same x.

00:15:53.019 --> 00:15:56.831
You are not really saying that
this is an infinitesimally small

00:15:56.831 --> 00:16:00.031
number.
You are just saying that it is

00:16:00.031 --> 00:16:04.026
smaller than this to the degree
that it is not changing this

00:16:04.026 --> 00:16:08.088
very much, so you don't have to
actually do that subtraction.

00:16:08.088 --> 00:16:11.000
And so the rule we use for that
is 5%.

00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:18.666
Again, there are these types of
problems.

00:16:18.666 --> 00:16:22.000
Now we are going to look at a
weak base problem.

00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:29.030
Let's look at a weak base
problem.

00:16:29.030 --> 00:16:31.000
I need better chalk than that.

00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:40.000
All right.
Weak base in water.

00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:53.230
If we have NH three
plus water, it will go to the

00:16:53.230 --> 00:16:58.181
conjugate of NH three,
which is NH four plus

00:16:58.181 --> 00:17:02.758
and hydroxide ion.

00:17:02.758 --> 00:17:07.175
If you are talking about a weak

00:17:07.175 --> 00:17:10.824
base in water problem,
you are going to expect to see

00:17:10.824 --> 00:17:15.105
hydronium ion on the other side.
And this is just a check that

00:17:15.105 --> 00:17:19.385
you want to make sure you are
asking yourself as you are doing

00:17:19.385 --> 00:17:22.192
these problems.
If you write the equation

00:17:22.192 --> 00:17:25.421
wrong, you are going to be in a
lot of trouble.

00:17:25.421 --> 00:17:29.000
Weak base should yield a basic
solution.

00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:33.918
You should be getting hydroxide
ions out.

00:17:33.918 --> 00:17:38.467
All right.
If we look at this problem,

00:17:38.467 --> 00:17:44.122
we have an initial
concentration of 0.15 molar.

00:17:44.122 --> 00:17:51.500
And we don't have any of this,
and we don't have any of that.

00:17:51.500 --> 00:17:59.000
The change is going to be minus
x, plus x and plus x.

00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:05.054
Then, at equilibrium,
we will have 0.15 minus x,

00:18:05.054 --> 00:18:08.274
and we will have x,
and x.

00:18:08.274 --> 00:18:16.261
Now it is a weak base in water,
so we are going to talk about a

00:18:16.261 --> 00:18:19.352
Kb.
And so Kb is the base

00:18:19.352 --> 00:18:25.922
ionization constant.
Kb is also going to be equal to

00:18:25.922 --> 00:18:32.362
the products because it is an
equilibrium constant,

00:18:32.362 --> 00:18:40.702
products over reactants.
And we are not including water

00:18:40.702 --> 00:18:47.736
because it is the solvent.
This will be equal to x squared

00:18:47.736 --> 00:18:53.536
over 0.15 minus x.
And

00:18:53.536 --> 00:19:01.063
we can try this assumption again
that that might be equal to x

00:19:01.063 --> 00:19:06.000
squared over 0.15.

00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:11.841
The Kb is given.
And for a lot of the problems,

00:19:11.841 --> 00:19:19.206
you will be able to look this
up in your book of 1.8x10^-5.

00:19:19.206 --> 00:19:24.920
Again, it is a weak base.
It is less than one.

00:19:24.920 --> 00:19:30.000
It has a Kb that is less than
one.

00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:37.920
And so if we solve for x here,
we get x as 0.00164.

00:19:37.920 --> 00:19:46.316
And now, we can check our
assumption that that is okay

00:19:46.316 --> 00:19:53.445
using the 5% rule.
0.00164 over 0.15 times 100

00:19:53.445 --> 00:19:59.782
gives you 1.1%.

00:19:59.782 --> 00:20:03.714
You are checking the

00:20:03.714 --> 00:20:06.799
assumption, and the assumption
is OK.

00:20:06.799 --> 00:20:11.000
It is less than 5%,
so we can use that number.

00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:22.887
Now we want to find out the pH
of this mixture at equilibrium.

00:20:22.887 --> 00:20:27.967
And we have x.
x is equal to the hydroxide ion

00:20:27.967 --> 00:20:31.650
concentration.
We can calculate,

00:20:31.650 --> 00:20:36.990
first, pOH minus log of the
hydroxide ion concentration.

00:20:36.990 --> 00:20:42.038
And so we have minus log of
0.00164, and we get 2.79.

00:20:42.038 --> 00:20:47.669
This only had

00:20:47.669 --> 00:20:53.398
two real significant figures.
We were carrying an extra one.

00:20:53.398 --> 00:20:57.669
We only had 0.15.
We only had two significant

00:20:57.669 --> 00:21:04.166
figures here.
This is going to get two after

00:21:04.166 --> 00:21:09.861
the decimal point.
Since we have two here,

00:21:09.861 --> 00:21:14.583
we get two sig fig's after
decimal.

00:21:14.583 --> 00:21:20.000
Now we have pOH.
How do we get pH?

00:21:25.000 --> 00:21:29.989
We can subtract from 14,
so the pH is going to equal

00:21:29.989 --> 00:21:34.000
14.00 minus 2.79.

00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:37.304
And it will be 11.21,
that will be the pH.

00:21:37.304 --> 00:21:41.737
And I just want to remind
people, sometimes when you are

00:21:41.737 --> 00:21:46.492
in a hurry on a test and you get
to this point and have this

00:21:46.492 --> 00:21:49.797
number of 2.79 and you say,
oh, I am done.

00:21:49.797 --> 00:21:53.826
But that is the pOH.
And, if you think about it for

00:21:53.826 --> 00:21:58.501
a minute, a weak base in water,
a base in water should give

00:21:58.501 --> 00:22:03.096
rise to a basic pH.
i.e., a pH greater than 7.

00:22:03.096 --> 00:22:05.919
Below 7 is acidic.
Above 7 is basic.

00:22:05.919 --> 00:22:08.903
You have to remember to convert
to pH.

00:22:08.903 --> 00:22:11.403
The pH should be a basic
number.

00:22:11.403 --> 00:22:14.870
Just keep it in mind,
as you are doing these

00:22:14.870 --> 00:22:18.258
problems, think about what the
problem was.

00:22:18.258 --> 00:22:22.854
Oh, it is a weak base in water,
does my answer make sense,

00:22:22.854 --> 00:22:26.887
to kind of double-check that
you have gone the full

00:22:26.887 --> 00:22:31.000
direction.
OK, so that is weak base.

00:22:31.000 --> 00:22:36.376
Now we are going to talk about
salts in solution for a minute.

00:22:36.376 --> 00:22:41.928
And salts in solution are going
to break down into weak acid and

00:22:41.928 --> 00:22:45.277
weak base problems.
If you have a salt,

00:22:45.277 --> 00:22:49.508
a salt can be formed by mixing
an acid in a base,

00:22:49.508 --> 00:22:53.738
as shown up here,
but the pH of salt water is not

00:22:53.738 --> 00:22:58.579
always going to be neutral.
If the salt contains,

00:22:58.579 --> 00:23:01.588
for example,
the conjugate acid of a weak

00:23:01.588 --> 00:23:04.522
base, then it contains a
conjugate acid,

00:23:04.522 --> 00:23:07.305
so it will produce an acidic
solution.

00:23:07.305 --> 00:23:11.592
Also, salts that contain some
small highly charged metals,

00:23:11.592 --> 00:23:15.730
like iron three plus,
will also affect the pH.

00:23:15.730 --> 00:23:18.889
This is something that you
should remember.

00:23:18.889 --> 00:23:23.252
Group 1 and Group 2 metals or
metal cations with charges of

00:23:23.252 --> 00:23:26.938
plus one, we have lithium,
calcium plus two,

00:23:26.938 --> 00:23:31.000
silver plus one.

00:23:31.000 --> 00:23:35.212
These are all going to be
neutral, but other things like

00:23:35.212 --> 00:23:38.045
iron three plus will
not be.

00:23:38.045 --> 00:23:42.411
Or, if you have a salt that
contains a conjugate base of a

00:23:42.411 --> 00:23:46.929
weak acid, it is a conjugate
base, so it can produce a basic

00:23:46.929 --> 00:23:49.610
solution.
If you remember on Monday,

00:23:49.610 --> 00:23:54.205
we measured the pH of MIT tap
water and found that it was not

00:23:54.205 --> 00:23:56.809
neutral.
It was pH 6 rather than 7,

00:23:56.809 --> 00:24:01.175
so that would suggest that
there was some salt in that tap

00:24:01.175 --> 00:24:06.000
water that was giving rise to a
non-neutral pH.

00:24:11.000 --> 00:24:13.248
This is also review from last
time.

00:24:13.248 --> 00:24:17.018
There is this relationship
between the conjugate acids and

00:24:17.018 --> 00:24:19.267
bases.
This is not in your handout,

00:24:19.267 --> 00:24:22.507
but just to remind you what we
were talking about,

00:24:22.507 --> 00:24:26.277
if you have a strong acid,
its conjugate is ineffective as

00:24:26.277 --> 00:24:28.526
a base.
If you have an acid that is

00:24:28.526 --> 00:24:32.626
moderately weak to weak then it
will have a conjugate base that

00:24:32.626 --> 00:24:36.000
is also moderately weak to very
weak.

00:24:36.000 --> 00:24:42.923
And if you have a really strong
base then its conjugate will be

00:24:42.923 --> 00:24:48.954
ineffective as an acid.
So, there is this relationship.

00:24:48.954 --> 00:24:53.756
Let's take a look at some
examples of salts.

00:24:53.756 --> 00:24:58.000
If we have NH four Cl.

00:24:58.000 --> 00:25:02.779
If you are asked whether
putting some amount of this in

00:25:02.779 --> 00:25:08.002
water will lead to an acidic
solution or a basic solution or

00:25:08.002 --> 00:25:12.339
a neutral solution,
this is how you would approach

00:25:12.339 --> 00:25:15.880
the problem.
First you are going to break

00:25:15.880 --> 00:25:20.748
this compound through the middle
and consider two sides.

00:25:20.748 --> 00:25:25.882
This salt will be composed of
NH four plus and Cl

00:25:25.882 --> 00:25:29.511
minus.
Then, you are going to ask

00:25:29.511 --> 00:25:35.000
whether this is a conjugate acid
of a weak base.

00:25:35.000 --> 00:25:40.539
Is this a conjugate acid of a
weak base?

00:25:40.539 --> 00:25:49.346
If it is a conjugate acid of a
weak base, then that will affect

00:25:49.346 --> 00:25:56.448
the pH of the solution.
What is the conjugate of NH

00:25:56.448 --> 00:26:02.146
four plus?
The conjugate of this is

00:26:02.146 --> 00:26:05.186
ammonia.
If you take the weak base,

00:26:05.186 --> 00:26:08.674
the conjugate,
the weak base is NH three.

00:26:08.674 --> 00:26:11.894
And if you added a proton to

00:26:11.894 --> 00:26:17.260
this you would get the conjugate
acid NH four plus.

00:26:17.260 --> 00:26:21.731
This is a weak base,
so the answer to that question

00:26:21.731 --> 00:26:24.861
was yes.
You could look it up in the

00:26:24.861 --> 00:26:26.829
table.
Here is ammonia.

00:26:26.829 --> 00:26:33.000
It has a Kb that is fairly
small so it is a weak base.

00:26:33.000 --> 00:26:37.593
And we also had it on this
chart.

00:26:37.593 --> 00:26:42.473
You had NH three over
here.

00:26:42.473 --> 00:26:50.081
And so you could see that it
is, in fact, a weak base.

00:26:50.081 --> 00:26:54.961
And we can look up the Kb for
that.

00:26:54.961 --> 00:27:03.000
And so the Kb is 1.8x10^-5.
That is a weak base.

00:27:03.000 --> 00:27:08.188
Because the conjugate is a weak
base, that means that the

00:27:08.188 --> 00:27:11.338
conjugate acid is also a weak
acid.

00:27:11.338 --> 00:27:15.044
And so this should be acidic in
solution.

00:27:15.044 --> 00:27:17.916
That should be acid in
solution.

00:27:17.916 --> 00:27:21.530
And let's just write that out
over here.

00:27:21.530 --> 00:27:26.533
If we have NH four plus,
that has got to be a

00:27:26.533 --> 00:27:32.000
weak acid because its conjugate
is a weak base.

00:27:32.000 --> 00:27:36.990
And if we put the weak acid in
water, we should get the

00:27:36.990 --> 00:27:40.501
conjugate base back plus
hydronium ion.

00:27:40.501 --> 00:27:45.584
And the presence of the

00:27:45.584 --> 00:27:51.036
hydronium ion is going to make
that acidic, and so this is a

00:27:51.036 --> 00:27:55.564
weak base over here.
Its conjugate is a weak base.

00:27:55.564 --> 00:28:00.000
And we can look up a Ka number
for it.

00:28:00.000 --> 00:28:03.248
5.6x10^-10.
That is, in fact,

00:28:03.248 --> 00:28:07.539
a weak acid.
And so here it is on this

00:28:07.539 --> 00:28:10.324
table.
We can look it up.

00:28:10.324 --> 00:28:16.240
And it is less than 1 and is
definitely a weak acid.

00:28:16.240 --> 00:28:23.316
This part on this side of the
compound, we have something that

00:28:23.316 --> 00:28:29.000
is going to produce an acidic
solution.

00:28:29.000 --> 00:28:35.395
Now we have to ask,
well, what about this side over

00:28:35.395 --> 00:28:38.593
here?
And so we would ask,

00:28:38.593 --> 00:28:43.581
is this a conjugate base of a
weak acid?

00:28:43.581 --> 00:28:50.232
Is Cl minus a
conjugate base of a weak acid?

00:28:50.232 --> 00:28:57.011
What would be the conjugate
acid of Cl minus?

00:28:57.011 --> 00:29:02.000
HCl.
So the conjugate is HCl.

00:29:02.000 --> 00:29:03.687
Is that weak?
No.

00:29:03.687 --> 00:29:09.064
This is a strong acid.
And that is one that you will

00:29:09.064 --> 00:29:13.809
encounter a bunch,
so you will definitely have

00:29:13.809 --> 00:29:19.608
that memorized by the time you
get through the problems.

00:29:19.608 --> 00:29:25.513
It has a Ka over here of 10^-7.
If you put that in water,

00:29:25.513 --> 00:29:30.891
if you had HCl in water,
it is a really strong acid,

00:29:30.891 --> 00:29:35.929
Ka 10^7.
And so it would go pretty much

00:29:35.929 --> 00:29:41.299
all the way to completion.
That means that this would be

00:29:41.299 --> 00:29:45.986
ineffective as a base,
if you have a strong acid.

00:29:45.986 --> 00:29:50.868
Again, there are these
relationships that we talked

00:29:50.868 --> 00:29:54.481
about.
If something is a really strong

00:29:54.481 --> 00:30:00.437
acid up here then its conjugate
is completely ineffective as a

00:30:00.437 --> 00:30:04.169
base.
This then is going to be

00:30:04.169 --> 00:30:07.422
neutral.
Because this is not going to

00:30:07.422 --> 00:30:11.941
change the pH anymore,
it is ineffective as a base.

00:30:11.941 --> 00:30:16.370
It is not going to make the
solution basic at all.

00:30:16.370 --> 00:30:21.250
Whereas, on the other side,
NH four plus is a

00:30:21.250 --> 00:30:26.311
conjugate acid of a weak base,
so it will produce an acid

00:30:26.311 --> 00:30:29.927
solution.
The answer is that this salt in

00:30:29.927 --> 00:30:33.000
water will be acidic.

00:30:38.000 --> 00:30:42.313
If you were given an amount of
this compound,

00:30:42.313 --> 00:30:45.745
if you said 0.15 molar,
for example,

00:30:45.745 --> 00:30:50.254
what is the pH,
you could work that out by just

00:30:50.254 --> 00:30:55.745
doing a weak acid type problem
and solving for x here and

00:30:55.745 --> 00:31:00.319
calculating pH.
This particular salt in water

00:31:00.319 --> 00:31:04.000
problem is just a weak acid in
water problem.

00:31:12.000 --> 00:31:15.000
OK.
Let's look at another example.

00:31:26.000 --> 00:31:32.024
Again, we are going to take
this compound and break it up.

00:31:32.024 --> 00:31:37.203
And we will form Na plus
and CH3COO minus.

00:31:37.203 --> 00:31:44.516
Then we ask is this a conjugate

00:31:44.516 --> 00:31:52.169
acid of a weak base?
And what is the answer?

00:31:52.169 --> 00:32:00.000
Where do you think it probably
came from?

00:32:00.000 --> 00:32:03.850
Yeah.
It probably came from NaOH.

00:32:03.850 --> 00:32:07.580
This one, the answer here is
no.

00:32:07.580 --> 00:32:14.439
And we talked about rules that
all Group 1 and Group 2 are

00:32:14.439 --> 00:32:18.410
neutral.
Group 1 ions are neutral.

00:32:18.410 --> 00:32:24.547
Group 1 and Group 2 are
neutral, so this in solution

00:32:24.547 --> 00:32:29.000
will be neutral.
All right.

00:32:29.000 --> 00:32:36.508
Let's look at the other side
and ask, is this the conjugate

00:32:36.508 --> 00:32:42.464
base of a weak acid?
And what would be the acid

00:32:42.464 --> 00:32:45.441
here?
Yeah, acidic acid.

00:32:45.441 --> 00:32:51.397
We have CH3COOH.
And we can look to see if that

00:32:51.397 --> 00:32:58.000
is a weak acid.
And we can look it up here.

00:32:58.000 --> 00:33:04.000
And so we have,
get the right line,

00:33:04.000 --> 00:33:10.000
1.76x10^-5.
Is that a weak acid?

00:33:15.000 --> 00:33:18.111
Is that a weak acid?
Yes.

00:33:18.111 --> 00:33:26.148
If it is a conjugate base of a
weak acid then in solution it is

00:33:26.148 --> 00:33:31.272
going to be basic.
And we can work that out.

00:33:31.272 --> 00:33:34.818
If we wrote it out,
we have CH3COO minus

00:33:34.818 --> 00:33:40.363
in water is going
to yield hydroxide ions and the

00:33:40.363 --> 00:33:44.909
conjugate acid over here,
and the presence of this,

00:33:44.909 --> 00:33:49.363
of the hydroxide ion will make
the solution basic,

00:33:49.363 --> 00:33:52.545
so this is a weak base on this
side.

00:33:57.000 --> 00:34:00.374
And so if you were asked,
given an amount,

00:34:00.374 --> 00:34:05.064
you could solve the problem
using the Kb of the weak base,

00:34:05.064 --> 00:34:08.521
solving for OH minus,
finding pOH,

00:34:08.521 --> 00:34:11.977
and then pH.
Overall, this salt in solution

00:34:11.977 --> 00:34:14.775
will give rise to a basic
solution.

00:34:14.775 --> 00:34:19.548
You should have a pH greater
than 7, so this salt and water

00:34:19.548 --> 00:34:22.428
would give rise to a basic
solution.

00:34:22.428 --> 00:34:27.531
And this salt and water problem
breaks down into a weak base in

00:34:27.531 --> 00:34:36.000
water problem.
Let's just do the generic --

00:34:41.000 --> 00:34:47.020
-- type of problem.
In the general case,

00:34:47.020 --> 00:34:56.436
if we have made-up compound XZ.
Made-up compound XZ will break

00:34:56.436 --> 00:35:04.000
down into X plus and Z
minus.

00:35:04.000 --> 00:35:13.655
And you are going to ask is
this a conjugate acid of weak

00:35:13.655 --> 00:35:22.965
base, or you are asking,
basically, is this going to be

00:35:22.965 --> 00:35:29.000
acidic?
If the answer is yes --

00:35:29.000 --> 00:35:34.762
If you have a conjugate of a
weak base, which is a weak acid,

00:35:34.762 --> 00:35:37.836
you will have an acidic
solution.

00:35:37.836 --> 00:35:42.062
If the answer is no,
you will have a neutral,

00:35:42.062 --> 00:35:46.384
at least in terms of the X.
On the other side,

00:35:46.384 --> 00:35:51.378
for the Z minus,
you are asking the question,

00:35:51.378 --> 00:35:55.124
is this a conjugate base of a
weak acid?

00:35:55.124 --> 00:36:01.079
If it is a conjugate base of a
weak acid then it is going to be

00:36:01.079 --> 00:36:04.814
basic.
It will be a weak base.

00:36:04.814 --> 00:36:08.994
And so the answer is yes,
you are going to get a basic

00:36:08.994 --> 00:36:11.833
solution.
If the answer is no here it

00:36:11.833 --> 00:36:14.830
will be neutral.
And in these problems,

00:36:14.830 --> 00:36:19.563
in the short answer type format
here, you are not going to be

00:36:19.563 --> 00:36:24.295
given a case where one side will
be acidic and the other side

00:36:24.295 --> 00:36:28.949
will be basic because then you
cannot give a short answer to

00:36:28.949 --> 00:36:32.656
that problem.
You would have to figure out

00:36:32.656 --> 00:36:35.791
which one is more acidic and
which one was more basic.

00:36:35.791 --> 00:36:39.222
In these types of problems one
side will always be neutral,

00:36:39.222 --> 00:36:42.594
or they could both be neutral,
you will see examples where

00:36:42.594 --> 00:36:45.670
both of them are neutral,
but you are looking at each

00:36:45.670 --> 00:36:47.740
side and asking a question about
it.

00:36:47.740 --> 00:36:52.000
That is how you go about doing
these salt and water problems.

00:36:59.000 --> 00:37:02.233
All right.
This leads us right into

00:37:02.233 --> 00:37:05.751
buffers.
Buffers, this is another type

00:37:05.751 --> 00:37:11.171
of problem that we will have.
Again, you are talking about

00:37:11.171 --> 00:37:16.877
weak acids and weak bases here.
A buffer is any solution that

00:37:16.877 --> 00:37:22.582
maintains pretty much a constant
pH despite the addition of a

00:37:22.582 --> 00:37:28.573
small amount of acids and bases.
Buffering is all about constant

00:37:28.573 --> 00:37:32.015
pH.
An acidic buffer is just a

00:37:32.015 --> 00:37:36.744
buffer that is going to pH or
stay at sort of a constant pH in

00:37:36.744 --> 00:37:40.077
the acid range,
so the acid side of neutral,

00:37:40.077 --> 00:37:44.496
and it would consist of a weak
acid and its conjugate base

00:37:44.496 --> 00:37:48.372
supplied as a salt.
A basic buffer will have a weak

00:37:48.372 --> 00:37:51.937
base and its conjugate acid
supplied as a salt,

00:37:51.937 --> 00:37:56.124
and it is going to buffer on
the basic side of neutral.

00:37:56.124 --> 00:38:00.000
That makes a lot of sense.
All right.

00:38:00.000 --> 00:38:03.844
Let's look at a buffer example.
In all buffers,

00:38:03.844 --> 00:38:08.857
you are going to have an acid
mixed with its conjugate in the

00:38:08.857 --> 00:38:12.451
form of a salt to get a dynamic
equilibrium.

00:38:12.451 --> 00:38:16.378
And so if we have this,
we have the acid and its

00:38:16.378 --> 00:38:20.640
conjugate added here.
And we ask what happens if you

00:38:20.640 --> 00:38:23.481
add a strong acid to this
solution?

00:38:23.481 --> 00:38:28.579
Again, what we want to have a
buffer do is maintain a constant

00:38:28.579 --> 00:38:32.720
pH.
You need to have about the same

00:38:32.720 --> 00:38:37.109
amount of this guy as this guy
for that to be true.

00:38:37.109 --> 00:38:42.375
If you added strong acid and
you had some of this and some of

00:38:42.375 --> 00:38:47.904
this, the acid is going to react
with a conjugate base and drive

00:38:47.904 --> 00:38:53.082
it in this direction using up
the amount of strong acid that

00:38:53.082 --> 00:38:55.276
was added.
The added acid,

00:38:55.276 --> 00:39:00.630
hydronium ions are effectively
removed and the pH stays pretty

00:39:00.630 --> 00:39:05.409
much constant.
Now what happens if you add a

00:39:05.409 --> 00:39:08.982
strong base?
Well, a strong base is going to

00:39:08.982 --> 00:39:11.808
react with the weak acid over
here.

00:39:11.808 --> 00:39:16.461
And it will also be consumed.
And so the OH is removing a

00:39:16.461 --> 00:39:21.696
proton, it is reacting with the
weak acid, and it will form more

00:39:21.696 --> 00:39:25.186
conjugate base and it will also
form water.

00:39:25.186 --> 00:39:29.756
Again, it is effectively
removed and the pH stays pretty

00:39:29.756 --> 00:39:34.222
much constant.
A buffer should be a source in

00:39:34.222 --> 00:39:37.259
a sink for added problems to the
reaction.

00:39:37.259 --> 00:39:41.407
It is going to use up either
the acid or the base that is

00:39:41.407 --> 00:39:44.518
added and keep the pH pretty
much constant.

00:39:44.518 --> 00:39:48.888
Again, what is happening is
that the weak acid that you use,

00:39:48.888 --> 00:39:53.407
and you can have anyone there,
is going to transfer protons to

00:39:53.407 --> 00:39:55.481
this.
And that will cause the

00:39:55.481 --> 00:40:00.000
reaction to happen and use up
the hydroxide ion.

00:40:00.000 --> 00:40:04.628
A conjugate base that is added
as a form of a salt would then

00:40:04.628 --> 00:40:08.639
be able to accept protons from
any acid that is used.

00:40:08.639 --> 00:40:13.344
So you need both the weak acid
and the conjugate base added in

00:40:13.344 --> 00:40:17.046
the form of salt.
One will react if you add extra

00:40:17.046 --> 00:40:19.360
acid.
One will react if you add

00:40:19.360 --> 00:40:22.600
excess base.
Why wouldn't a strong acid and

00:40:22.600 --> 00:40:28.000
the conjugate base of that
strong acid make a good buffer?

00:40:41.000 --> 00:40:42.865
Right.
Because the conjugate base

00:40:42.865 --> 00:40:46.481
would be ineffective as a base.
And so the strong acid would go

00:40:46.481 --> 00:40:48.755
to completion,
would drive to the right.

00:40:48.755 --> 00:40:52.311
This is ineffective as a base,
so you are not going to push it

00:40:52.311 --> 00:40:55.052
back the other way.
You are only going to have a

00:40:55.052 --> 00:40:58.551
good buffering system with a
weak something and its conjugate

00:40:58.551 --> 00:41:03.047
that is also a weak something.
A weak acid and its conjugate

00:41:03.047 --> 00:41:06.576
weak base, a weak base and its
conjugate weak acid.

00:41:06.576 --> 00:41:10.176
That will buffer because it
will go both directions.

00:41:10.176 --> 00:41:13.635
Both conjugates have to work as
an acid or a base.

00:41:13.635 --> 00:41:17.941
If you have a strong acid then
its conjugate is ineffective as

00:41:17.941 --> 00:41:19.423
a base.
It won't work.

00:41:19.423 --> 00:41:23.729
If you have a strong base then
its conjugate is ineffective as

00:41:23.729 --> 00:41:26.270
an acid and it won't work.
All right.

00:41:26.270 --> 00:41:31.000
Base buffering example,
the same stuff applies here.

00:41:31.000 --> 00:41:35.076
If you add a strong acid,
it will react with the base.

00:41:35.076 --> 00:41:39.307
The base will accept the
protons and make more of the NH

00:41:39.307 --> 00:41:41.923
four.
And it will use up the strong

00:41:41.923 --> 00:41:44.461
acid.
When a strong base is added,

00:41:44.461 --> 00:41:48.538
it will react with the
conjugate acid and go the other

00:41:48.538 --> 00:41:51.461
direction.
And so you will form more of

00:41:51.461 --> 00:41:55.846
the conjugate base and water.
Again, the pH is staying the

00:41:55.846 --> 00:41:58.307
same.
You are using up the strong

00:41:58.307 --> 00:42:03.131
base that is added.
In a buffer action you have a

00:42:03.131 --> 00:42:07.394
weak base accepting protons
supplied by the strong acid and

00:42:07.394 --> 00:42:11.510
you have the conjugate acid of
the weak base transferring

00:42:11.510 --> 00:42:15.478
protons to the hydroxide,
the strong base that is added

00:42:15.478 --> 00:42:19.227
using that up as well.
Again, it is about going both

00:42:19.227 --> 00:42:23.195
directions of the reaction.
That makes something a good

00:42:23.195 --> 00:42:25.621
buffer.
A buffer mixture of a weak

00:42:25.621 --> 00:42:29.516
conjugate acid and base
stabilize the pH of a solution

00:42:29.516 --> 00:42:34.000
by providing a source or sink
for the protons.

00:42:34.000 --> 00:42:38.358
Either they are providing a
source to neutralize the OH that

00:42:38.358 --> 00:42:42.791
is minus or a sink for
the protons that are added in

00:42:42.791 --> 00:42:46.337
the form of acid,
so the pH stays pretty much the

00:42:46.337 --> 00:42:48.923
same.
You need something that can do

00:42:48.923 --> 00:42:52.174
this dynamic equilibrium to be a
good buffer.

00:42:52.174 --> 00:42:55.720
Let me just give you,
in the last couple minutes,

00:42:55.720 --> 00:43:00.079
an example of why buffering is
important from a human health

00:43:00.079 --> 00:43:02.840
perspective.
All right.

00:43:02.840 --> 00:43:06.623
Your blood is buffered around a
neutral range,

00:43:06.623 --> 00:43:09.901
and the buffering agents are
shown here.

00:43:09.901 --> 00:43:14.524
Carbonic acid and bicarbonate
are effective as buffering

00:43:14.524 --> 00:43:17.634
agents.
They can provide the source or

00:43:17.634 --> 00:43:22.594
sink for added stress to the
system, for added acid or added

00:43:22.594 --> 00:43:27.637
base, so you blood is buffered.
And this is really important.

00:43:27.637 --> 00:43:33.456
If your blood pH changes --
Enzymes are designed to work at

00:43:33.456 --> 00:43:36.942
particular pHs.
Molecules are not necessarily

00:43:36.942 --> 00:43:41.142
stable at certain pHs.
Our body would not work well if

00:43:41.142 --> 00:43:43.756
it was not appropriately
buffered.

00:43:43.756 --> 00:43:48.590
Let me give you an example of a
genetic defect that overwhelms

00:43:48.590 --> 00:43:53.344
the buffering capacity of the
blood and leads to a condition.

00:43:53.344 --> 00:43:56.830
This is an enzyme that you have
in your body.

00:43:56.830 --> 00:44:01.798
It is in your mitochondria.
And it requires vitamin B12.

00:44:01.798 --> 00:44:04.239
This is what the enzyme is
involved in.

00:44:04.239 --> 00:44:07.965
It is involved in breaking down
fatty acids to form energy.

00:44:07.965 --> 00:44:11.691
Most people like this enzyme.
They are very happy with this

00:44:11.691 --> 00:44:13.811
enzyme.
Most people want their fat

00:44:13.811 --> 00:44:16.895
converted to energy,
and so this enzyme helps out

00:44:16.895 --> 00:44:18.758
with that going on.
All right.

00:44:18.758 --> 00:44:22.355
What happens if you have a
genetic defect or if you don't

00:44:22.355 --> 00:44:25.503
have enough vitamin B12,
but in this case they are

00:44:25.503 --> 00:44:30.000
talking about a genetic defect,
this step is blocked.

00:44:30.000 --> 00:44:33.829
Your body is making a lot of
Methylmalonyl-CoA and it doesn't

00:44:33.829 --> 00:44:36.638
know what to do with it.
It is a huge amount,

00:44:36.638 --> 00:44:39.957
and so it actually gets
excreted from the body in the

00:44:39.957 --> 00:44:42.382
form of an acid.
And so this leads to a

00:44:42.382 --> 00:44:45.000
condition known as methylmalonic
aciduria.

00:44:45.000 --> 00:44:48.702
There is so much of this made
that you are excreting like a

00:44:48.702 --> 00:44:52.085
gram of this acid every day.
The blood is overwhelmed.

00:44:52.085 --> 00:44:54.063
It cannot handle that much
acid.

00:44:54.063 --> 00:44:56.553
Its buffering capacity is not
that good.

00:44:56.553 --> 00:45:00.000
All right.
What causes this problem?

00:45:00.000 --> 00:45:04.018
I will tell you that this now
is the amino acid sequence of

00:45:04.018 --> 00:45:06.928
the enzyme.
Enzymes are made up of multiple

00:45:06.928 --> 00:45:10.392
amino acids strung together in a
polypeptide chain.

00:45:10.392 --> 00:45:14.341
And down here is the number
721, so this is a lot of amino

00:45:14.341 --> 00:45:16.558
acids.
And at the time there were

00:45:16.558 --> 00:45:20.508
these babies born with this
condition, and the doctors did

00:45:20.508 --> 00:45:24.387
not know what to do to treat
them and a lot of the babies

00:45:24.387 --> 00:45:26.743
died.
A number of them got together

00:45:26.743 --> 00:45:30.982
and tried to sequence the gene.
Now, of course,

00:45:30.982 --> 00:45:34.650
there is the Human Genome
Project so we know a lot of the

00:45:34.650 --> 00:45:38.122
sequences of the genes.
But the doctors sequenced this

00:45:38.122 --> 00:45:40.938
gene and sat down with the
parents and said,

00:45:40.938 --> 00:45:44.737
OK, there is a mistake right
here, where that red arrow is.

00:45:44.737 --> 00:45:48.340
It should be a glycine residue
but it is something else.

00:45:48.340 --> 00:45:50.633
All right.
Imagine you are a parent.

00:45:50.633 --> 00:45:54.366
You have a kid and the doctor
tells you there is a mistake

00:45:54.366 --> 00:45:56.659
right here.
Well, that is fantastic.

00:45:56.659 --> 00:46:00.000
What are you going to do about
it?

00:46:00.000 --> 00:46:03.387
Well, at the time,
the doctors had no idea what to

00:46:03.387 --> 00:46:07.534
do about it because they didn't
really know what was going on

00:46:07.534 --> 00:46:10.023
here.
This answer partly came through

00:46:10.023 --> 00:46:13.548
structure determination.
They found that vitamin B12

00:46:13.548 --> 00:46:16.313
changes shape when it binds to a
protein.

00:46:16.313 --> 00:46:19.700
Here is vitamin B12.
It has this group attached to

00:46:19.700 --> 00:46:23.709
the cobalt when it is free.
When it is bound to the protein

00:46:23.709 --> 00:46:26.889
it looks like this.
This long group is extended

00:46:26.889 --> 00:46:32.231
into the core of the protein.
The protein needs a big hole to

00:46:32.231 --> 00:46:35.470
put this group.
And so this is a model of what

00:46:35.470 --> 00:46:39.573
the protein looks like and here
is a model of vitamin B12.

00:46:39.573 --> 00:46:42.164
We discovered that it fits like
this.

00:46:42.164 --> 00:46:45.259
It is fantastic.
There is a huge hole in the

00:46:45.259 --> 00:46:48.282
protein into which you can put
the vitamin.

00:46:48.282 --> 00:46:52.529
How did nature create a hole?
How did it make this space for

00:46:52.529 --> 00:46:58.000
the vitamin to fit and then with
the vitamin bond it is active?

00:46:58.000 --> 00:47:01.671
What it did was put the
smallest amino acids it could

00:47:01.671 --> 00:47:04.496
find over here.
Now, what happens in this

00:47:04.496 --> 00:47:08.451
mutant protein is that one of
those small amino acids was

00:47:08.451 --> 00:47:11.840
converted into something larger
in the dark blue.

00:47:11.840 --> 00:47:14.806
This was the protein that these
babies had.

00:47:14.806 --> 00:47:17.701
And the doctors kept giving
them more B12,

00:47:17.701 --> 00:47:21.302
more B12, more B12 and it
didn't do any good at all,

00:47:21.302 --> 00:47:25.045
because no matter how much you
gave, it couldn't bind.

00:47:25.045 --> 00:47:29.000
It was blocked.
The binding was blocked.

00:47:29.000 --> 00:47:33.127
This suggested to doctors that
instead of giving them the full

00:47:33.127 --> 00:47:37.052
vitamin B12, basically take a
pair of scissors and chop off

00:47:37.052 --> 00:47:41.180
part of it and create something
that looked more like this and

00:47:41.180 --> 00:47:44.766
then try to see if that would
then bind to the mutated

00:47:44.766 --> 00:47:47.338
protein.
That is the kind of thing that

00:47:47.338 --> 00:47:50.383
they were looking at,
trying to alleviate this

00:47:50.383 --> 00:47:54.714
particular condition because the
buffering of the blood is pretty

00:47:54.714 --> 00:47:57.708
good.
If could you restore some

00:47:57.708 --> 00:48:02.012
activity, get rid of some of the
acid, you might be able to have

00:48:02.012 --> 00:48:03.515
a more normal pH.
Okay.

00:48:03.515 --> 00:48:04.848
Have a good weekend.
