00:00:01.100 --> 00:00:03.469
Look, in honor
of you coming to my show,

00:00:03.502 --> 00:00:06.005
I-I wanted
to make you feel at home,

00:00:06.038 --> 00:00:07.774
and so I prepared

00:00:07.807 --> 00:00:10.176
a little bit
of authentic Mexican cuisine

00:00:10.209 --> 00:00:12.011
from one of our best taquerias,

00:00:12.044 --> 00:00:13.813
uh, the Trump Grill.

00:00:13.846 --> 00:00:15.515
(laughter)

00:00:15.548 --> 00:00:19.419
These are actual bowls
from the Trump Grill.

00:00:19.452 --> 00:00:22.422
Uh, I've been told it's, uh...

00:00:22.455 --> 00:00:24.557
-it's divine.
-(laughs)

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:27.093
Yes.

00:00:27.126 --> 00:00:28.294
I think Hispanics love it,

00:00:28.327 --> 00:00:29.796
-is what I've heard.
-This is a fake.

00:00:29.829 --> 00:00:31.464
-What?
-This is fake.

00:00:31.497 --> 00:00:33.433
-That's fake? That is...
-Can I throw it on the floor?

00:00:33.466 --> 00:00:35.368
-What? I...
-Yes?

00:00:35.401 --> 00:00:36.869
-No, are you...? No!
-Okay.

00:00:36.902 --> 00:00:39.205
-(cheering and applause)
-Wow.

00:00:41.774 --> 00:00:44.477
Okay.

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:46.780
I'm sorry.

00:00:49.582 --> 00:00:52.151
All right, you know what?
I see what you're gonna do.

00:00:52.184 --> 00:00:53.886
I'm here to talk about
your book, because you want

00:00:53.919 --> 00:00:55.088
to move on. That's what
this book is all about,

00:00:55.121 --> 00:00:56.422
-is that right?
-Yes, sir.

00:00:56.455 --> 00:00:58.157
 Let's Move On. 
I assume this is about the...

00:00:58.190 --> 00:00:59.959
the Russian hoax?
Is that correct?

00:00:59.992 --> 00:01:02.228
-Let's move on.
-Let's move on beyond this.

00:01:02.261 --> 00:01:04.230
-Yes. -What message... You know,
so you're gonna come on

00:01:04.263 --> 00:01:06.499
to my show. You're gonna...
you're gonna take a dump

00:01:06.532 --> 00:01:08.434
on my stage, apparently.
Thanks a lot.

00:01:08.467 --> 00:01:10.436
Thanks a lot, Mr. President.

00:01:10.469 --> 00:01:13.439
The message... the message is,

00:01:13.472 --> 00:01:17.443
if you're president,
behave like a president.

00:01:17.476 --> 00:01:19.445
If you are leader of the world,

00:01:19.478 --> 00:01:22.515
behave like the leader
of the world.

00:01:22.548 --> 00:01:25.184
This is nonsense,
what we have here today.

00:01:25.217 --> 00:01:26.786
It's a total mess.

00:01:26.819 --> 00:01:29.655
Just look at that shutdown
of government.

00:01:29.688 --> 00:01:34.160
Look at his, uh...
his comments around DACA.

00:01:34.193 --> 00:01:39.098
I mean, a million kids
that have university degrees,

00:01:39.131 --> 00:01:40.833
that been living in this nation,

00:01:40.866 --> 00:01:43.970
that are a massive...
that are very powerful force.

00:01:44.003 --> 00:01:47.173
I wish I can take them down
to Mexico,

00:01:47.206 --> 00:01:48.841
the one million of them.

00:01:48.874 --> 00:01:51.711
But I respect that they want
to live in this nation

00:01:51.744 --> 00:01:55.648
because they have been here
for a long, long time.

00:01:55.681 --> 00:01:58.985
But it's... that shows what kind
of a guy we have there.

00:01:59.018 --> 00:02:01.387
Uh, I'm talking
about Trump, yes.

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:03.222
I understand
you're talking about Trump.

00:02:03.255 --> 00:02:07.760
No, but, really, really,
I-I guess I'm trying to explain

00:02:07.793 --> 00:02:11.631
to American public opinion
what Mexico's all about.

00:02:11.664 --> 00:02:14.634
We're the 12th largest economy
in the world.

00:02:14.667 --> 00:02:17.970
We have the largest
manufacturing block anywhere

00:02:18.003 --> 00:02:19.972
in the world,
the most competitive.

00:02:20.005 --> 00:02:22.375
We are partners
of this great nation.

00:02:22.408 --> 00:02:25.511
And we have made this region--
Canada, United States,

00:02:25.544 --> 00:02:29.916
and Mexico-- the most
competitive region in the world.

00:02:29.949 --> 00:02:32.919
Otherwise, the four motor
companies-- the Chryslers--

00:02:32.952 --> 00:02:34.453
would not be alive.

00:02:34.486 --> 00:02:36.189
They went broke five years ago.

00:02:36.222 --> 00:02:39.992
And the only way they came back
to business and to market

00:02:40.025 --> 00:02:43.996
was by becoming
NAFTA corporations.

00:02:44.029 --> 00:02:47.200
And this region is the only one
prepared to compete

00:02:47.233 --> 00:02:49.602
with the East--
with Asia, with China.

00:02:49.635 --> 00:02:52.738
We have to save
the Western values right here

00:02:52.771 --> 00:02:55.007
-in North America.
-Okay, now...

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:56.976
(cheering and applause)

00:03:01.313 --> 00:03:04.283
This book is focused on America.

00:03:04.316 --> 00:03:06.219
-Yes, sir. -You're an outsider,
who, obviously,

00:03:06.252 --> 00:03:08.487
has a lot of love and care
for this country.

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:11.090
I love hearing
about how great America is.

00:03:11.123 --> 00:03:13.626
What... Why write a book
about America?

00:03:13.659 --> 00:03:16.229
What-what is it that you see
here that makes you want

00:03:16.262 --> 00:03:18.364
to-to help, as you put it?

00:03:18.397 --> 00:03:20.166
Uh, I would say harm,

00:03:20.199 --> 00:03:22.501
but-but I think you call it help
in this book.

00:03:22.534 --> 00:03:24.170
What is it?

00:03:24.203 --> 00:03:27.106
This half you see here
in front of you

00:03:27.139 --> 00:03:29.041
has American blood.

00:03:29.074 --> 00:03:32.311
My grandfather
was born in Cincinnati, Ohio,

00:03:32.344 --> 00:03:35.848
and he came as a migrant
down to Mexico.

00:03:35.881 --> 00:03:37.917
He rode all along,

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:41.187
and he settled in Guanajuato,
where we are.

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:44.857
And his dream became true
by coming to Mexico.

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:46.859
We've been there
for five generations.

00:03:46.892 --> 00:03:49.462
I love this nation.
America's great.

00:03:49.495 --> 00:03:51.264
It's already great.

00:03:51.297 --> 00:03:53.399
And it will keep on being great,

00:03:53.432 --> 00:03:56.335
as soon as you get rid
of this guy.

00:03:56.368 --> 00:03:57.403
(laughter)

00:03:57.436 --> 00:03:59.372
(cheering and applause)

00:04:03.175 --> 00:04:04.744
Is what you're trying to say,

00:04:04.777 --> 00:04:07.546
we need to make America great
 again?

00:04:07.579 --> 00:04:08.414
(laughter)
