00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.740
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:08.520
So now that we're all experts in
OAuth 2.0, we know that the

00:00:08.520 --> 00:00:11.060
first thing we want to do
to sign the user in is

00:00:11.060 --> 00:00:12.500
create a client ID.

00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:14.300
So let's start doing that.

00:00:14.300 --> 00:00:17.530
Now, if you've created any
client IDs before for any

00:00:17.530 --> 00:00:20.050
other Google services in the
past, you know that the thing

00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:24.930
to do is you go to
code.google.com/api/console,

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:27.425
and you create a new
project here.

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:36.560
Call it Screencast Example,
because I'm really creative.

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:39.040
And maybe we turn on
some services like

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:39.920
the Calendar API.

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:41.970
And we'll accept terms
of service.

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:48.060
And then we go to the API Access
section, and we create

00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:49.810
an OAuth 2.0 client ID.

00:00:49.810 --> 00:00:53.195
We'd add our product name,
My Calendar project.

00:00:56.420 --> 00:01:00.010
And we might create one for a
web application where we would

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:04.180
create a client ID to find a
redirect URI or maybe an

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:06.910
installed application where you
could set up something for

00:01:06.910 --> 00:01:10.135
an iOS device like this.

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:18.500
And look at that.

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:19.700
We got a client ID.

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:21.420
And everything is good, right?

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:22.350
Wrong.

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:24.650
This is not the way you would
set up a client ID

00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:26.190
using the Games API.

00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:29.710
So if you've been following
along with the last minute of

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:32.870
what I've been doing, stop and
erase everything you just did.

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:37.120
In fact, I'm going to go ahead
and delete this project.

00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:38.340
Yes, I want to delete.

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:39.260
All right.

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:43.710
So let's close this window
here and start again.

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:46.460
The reason I'm not asking you
to go to that Google APIs

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:49.180
Console is that when you
create a game in Game

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:52.160
Services, you're enabling a
bunch of features such as

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:53.870
leaderboards and achievements.

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:56.680
And those need to be set
up and associated

00:01:56.680 --> 00:01:57.990
with a client ID.

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:00.700
And so we're going to create
our OAuth 2.0 client ID

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:03.470
through the Google Play
Developer Console instead.

00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:05.180
So let's look at that.

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:07.300
To get to the Google Play
Developer Console, you're

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:12.470
going to go to
play.google.com/apps/publish.

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:15.260
When we get there, you should
see a screen that maybe looks

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:17.170
a little something like this.

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:20.070
If you have never used the
Google Play Developer Console

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:23.190
before, you'll be prompted to
create an account, which is

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:25.130
something you are going
to have to do.

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:29.920
You do have to pay a one-time
fee of $25, and that's to, I

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:31.330
guess, queue out the spammers.

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:33.490
And no, there's no way
around it, even

00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:34.610
if you're just testing.

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:38.630
So if that's you, go ahead and
pause this video, create an

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:42.320
account, and I'll see you back
here in a couple minutes.

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:42.630
OK.

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:44.980
Now that we all have accounts
set up on the Google Play

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:47.830
Developer Console, the thing
we're going to do is click on

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:50.880
this Use Google Play game
services button.

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:53.090
This takes us to the tab here
on the left with this little

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:54.560
controller icon.

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:56.700
And we're going to click on
this button to set up Play

00:02:56.700 --> 00:03:00.590
game services on a new game.

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:04.170
So because this is a brand new
project, we are going to say,

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:06.640
we don't use any Google
APIs in our game yet.

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:10.140
This other tab, I already used
Google APIs in my game, would

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:14.740
be useful if, say, you had
created APIs in the past on

00:03:14.740 --> 00:03:17.390
the Google APIs Console that
I showed you earlier.

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:19.630
Maybe you added maps to your
game or something.

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:22.940
And this would successfully
import that project and

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:26.100
associate that client ID with
whatever leaderboards and

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:28.140
achievements you create
in the future.

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:29.750
In our case, it's
much simpler.

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:32.350
We don't have any Google
APIs in our game yet.

00:03:32.350 --> 00:03:34.430
And so we're just going to
create one from scratch.

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:37.760
So the name of our game I am
going to call "Guess My

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:41.080
Number." And we'll give
it a category.

00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:43.860
I think this is really
Brain and Puzzle.

00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:46.190
And you'll notice this fine
print underneath says, hey,

00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:49.760
we're going to turn on Cloud
Save, Google+, Google Play

00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:52.300
game services for you.

00:03:52.300 --> 00:03:55.520
All those switches on the Google
APIs Console, we don't

00:03:55.520 --> 00:03:56.530
need to do that.

00:03:56.530 --> 00:04:02.280
So we'll just click Continue
and let it do its thing.

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:05.460
And now we're left with
our Game Details page.

00:04:05.460 --> 00:04:08.330
This name and description will
inform how your game appears

00:04:08.330 --> 00:04:11.230
throughout our system, including
on the Play Games

00:04:11.230 --> 00:04:13.650
app that is available
on Android devices.

00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:15.350
So make this somewhat
user friendly.

00:04:15.350 --> 00:04:17.070
Maybe you could use
your Play Store

00:04:17.070 --> 00:04:19.490
description here as well.

00:04:19.490 --> 00:04:22.369
In our case, we're just going
to make something--

00:04:22.369 --> 00:04:24.930
you know, actually, we can just
leave this blank because

00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:27.420
we don't really care for
testing purposes.

00:04:27.420 --> 00:04:30.090
The high-res icon, the feature
graphics, again, this is what

00:04:30.090 --> 00:04:32.485
would appear throughout our
system, including the Play

00:04:32.485 --> 00:04:33.720
Games destination app.

00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:35.980
So you'll want to make sure that
you use a nice icon and

00:04:35.980 --> 00:04:36.910
graphic here.

00:04:36.910 --> 00:04:39.360
Again, for testing purposes,
we don't need any of this.

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:42.790
So I'm just going to click Save
and leave this blank.

00:04:42.790 --> 00:04:44.960
The next thing we're going to
want to do is create a linked

00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:46.920
application.

00:04:46.920 --> 00:04:50.420
This panel here is where we
create our OAuth 2.0 client

00:04:50.420 --> 00:04:54.620
IDs as well as associate them--
or I guess link them--

00:04:54.620 --> 00:04:56.945
with any achievements and
leaderboards that we create in

00:04:56.945 --> 00:04:57.760
the future.

00:04:57.760 --> 00:05:01.190
Because we are creating an iOS
app, we're going to click this

00:05:01.190 --> 00:05:03.870
Link an iOS app button.

00:05:03.870 --> 00:05:05.510
And we've got the
name of our app.

00:05:05.510 --> 00:05:08.120
We're going to say Yes to iPhone
and iPad here even

00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:11.400
though our game is really only
optimized for the iPhone.

00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:14.730
You really only set this to No
if you didn't want users

00:05:14.730 --> 00:05:17.920
playing this particular game
on a particular device.

00:05:17.920 --> 00:05:20.920
In our case, I'm happy to
have users playing games

00:05:20.920 --> 00:05:23.200
on my iPad as well.

00:05:23.200 --> 00:05:26.600
So I'm going to add our bundle
identifier, which would be

00:05:26.600 --> 00:05:27.850
com.google.GuessMyNumber.

00:05:32.810 --> 00:05:36.620
And I'm going to leave the
iTunes app ID blank for now.

00:05:36.620 --> 00:05:39.260
Hit Save and Continue.

00:05:39.260 --> 00:05:41.790
And we're going to get a button
saying, click this to

00:05:41.790 --> 00:05:43.360
authorize your app now.

00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:45.480
So I'm going to click
that button.

00:05:45.480 --> 00:05:47.380
And this is branding
information.

00:05:47.380 --> 00:05:49.540
You might ask yourself, hey,
wait a minute, I just added

00:05:49.540 --> 00:05:50.600
branding information.

00:05:50.600 --> 00:05:52.040
What is this stuff?

00:05:52.040 --> 00:05:55.170
This is basically the name and
the logo that would appear in

00:05:55.170 --> 00:05:59.590
that OAuth 2.0 dialog that pops
up when the user first

00:05:59.590 --> 00:06:01.270
signs into your application.

00:06:01.270 --> 00:06:02.770
So you'll want to make sure
it looks legitimate.

00:06:02.770 --> 00:06:04.140
You want to make sure
your product name

00:06:04.140 --> 00:06:05.650
says something real.

00:06:05.650 --> 00:06:10.660
For a product logo, well, I'm
going to enter in a fantastic

00:06:10.660 --> 00:06:12.320
Google logo.

00:06:12.320 --> 00:06:14.550
In your case, you probably
want to add something

00:06:14.550 --> 00:06:17.550
associated with your own product
or company and/or

00:06:17.550 --> 00:06:18.800
homepage URL.

00:06:21.370 --> 00:06:23.650
We'll do google.com.

00:06:23.650 --> 00:06:26.280
On this section, you'll notice
your choices are very limited.

00:06:26.280 --> 00:06:28.890
It's an installed application,
and it's iOS.

00:06:28.890 --> 00:06:30.580
Confirm that this bundle
ID is correct.

00:06:30.580 --> 00:06:31.640
It should be.

00:06:31.640 --> 00:06:34.610
And if you have an App Store ID,
you can add it right here.

00:06:34.610 --> 00:06:36.450
In our case, we can
leave it blank.

00:06:36.450 --> 00:06:37.700
And we can hit Create Client.

00:06:40.450 --> 00:06:41.320
And look at that.

00:06:41.320 --> 00:06:43.830
We now have a client ID.

00:06:43.830 --> 00:06:48.410
So now, if you remember back to
our presentation, remember

00:06:48.410 --> 00:06:51.750
how we said that Google keeps
a database of client IDs and

00:06:51.750 --> 00:06:53.030
authorized redirects.

00:06:53.030 --> 00:06:55.740
Well, for our "Guess My Number"
game, we now have a

00:06:55.740 --> 00:06:58.440
client ID, which we just got
back from the Google Play

00:06:58.440 --> 00:07:01.770
Developer Console as well as an
authorized redirect, which

00:07:01.770 --> 00:07:03.830
is based on the bundle
identifier that

00:07:03.830 --> 00:07:05.910
we gave to the system.

00:07:05.910 --> 00:07:10.460
So this com.google.Guess
MyNumber:/oauth2callback, that

00:07:10.460 --> 00:07:12.600
is now associated with
our application.

00:07:12.600 --> 00:07:15.290
And you'll see how we use
that very shortly.

00:07:15.290 --> 00:07:16.280
So there we go.

00:07:16.280 --> 00:07:17.830
We now have a client ID.

00:07:17.830 --> 00:07:18.670
Keep a note of this.

00:07:18.670 --> 00:07:21.890
Maybe copy and paste it into a
text file somewhere because

00:07:21.890 --> 00:07:22.860
you're going to need this.

00:07:22.860 --> 00:07:25.490
However, if you forget to and
you need it again at some

00:07:25.490 --> 00:07:29.440
point, in your Linked Apps
listings, if you just click on

00:07:29.440 --> 00:07:32.790
this, you'll see
it right here.

00:07:32.790 --> 00:07:36.210
So you can always get to your
client ID if you ever need it.

00:07:36.210 --> 00:07:38.640
By the way, let's look at
our other panels here.

00:07:38.640 --> 00:07:40.030
You'll see Achievements.

00:07:40.030 --> 00:07:42.510
This is where we'll be able to
set up achievements at some

00:07:42.510 --> 00:07:43.950
point in the future.

00:07:43.950 --> 00:07:46.760
Leaderboards, where we'll be
able to set up leaderboards.

00:07:46.760 --> 00:07:50.720
And Testing, which is where we
can add test accounts that are

00:07:50.720 --> 00:07:54.510
allowed to access these game
services before we publish.

00:07:54.510 --> 00:07:57.310
Definitely go to the testing
panel if you haven't and

00:07:57.310 --> 00:07:59.790
confirm that the account that
you're planning on testing

00:07:59.790 --> 00:08:01.520
with is added here.

00:08:01.520 --> 00:08:04.230
By default, it should add the
account that you're using to

00:08:04.230 --> 00:08:07.920
develop with along with any
other accounts on your team,

00:08:07.920 --> 00:08:10.580
unless they don't have a G+
account set up, in which case,

00:08:10.580 --> 00:08:11.940
they won't get added.

00:08:11.940 --> 00:08:14.520
But again, you might be using
a different account to test

00:08:14.520 --> 00:08:16.570
with than the one you're
developing with.

00:08:16.570 --> 00:08:20.380
And if that is the case, click
this Add Testers button, and

00:08:20.380 --> 00:08:24.300
you can add, for example,
example@gmail.com.

00:08:24.300 --> 00:08:25.600
That's probably not
a real address.

00:08:25.600 --> 00:08:26.710
We won't actually add this.

00:08:26.710 --> 00:08:29.110
But if you did add some
addresses, they would be

00:08:29.110 --> 00:08:30.670
listed here as well.

00:08:30.670 --> 00:08:32.870
By the way, you might also
notice that we've got some

00:08:32.870 --> 00:08:36.080
green icons next to each
of our sections.

00:08:36.080 --> 00:08:38.340
And they signify different
things.

00:08:38.340 --> 00:08:41.460
If an icon is a half-green
circle like this, that

00:08:41.460 --> 00:08:44.100
basically means that you've
provided enough information to

00:08:44.100 --> 00:08:46.400
start testing the game but
not enough to have

00:08:46.400 --> 00:08:47.610
published the game.

00:08:47.610 --> 00:08:50.060
If you provide enough
information to publish this

00:08:50.060 --> 00:08:53.430
particular section, it will have
a green check like this.

00:08:53.430 --> 00:08:56.170
And if there's really a problem,
you'll see this grey

00:08:56.170 --> 00:08:57.800
triangle icon.

00:08:57.800 --> 00:09:01.350
So we can see here that
everything is set up enough

00:09:01.350 --> 00:09:03.030
for us to at least test.

00:09:03.030 --> 00:09:04.900
However, we're not allowed
to publish yet.

00:09:04.900 --> 00:09:07.230
And if you click on this
section, you'll see that it

00:09:07.230 --> 00:09:09.730
gives you a number of things
that are missing.

00:09:09.730 --> 00:09:13.060
So we don't have an icon for
Game Details, we don't have an

00:09:13.060 --> 00:09:16.450
iTunes app ID, and we need
to provide at least five

00:09:16.450 --> 00:09:17.770
achievements for our game.

00:09:17.770 --> 00:09:20.040
So we're good enough for
testing, not enough for

00:09:20.040 --> 00:09:20.700
publishing.

00:09:20.700 --> 00:09:23.290
But that's OK, because really,
testing is all we need for our

00:09:23.290 --> 00:09:24.880
development purposes.

00:09:24.880 --> 00:09:27.700
So now that we've gotten our
very first client ID, let's

00:09:27.700 --> 00:09:31.140
make use of it and really
add that Sign In button.

00:09:31.140 --> 00:09:32.810
And we're going to do that
in the next lesson.

00:09:32.810 --> 00:09:43.215
