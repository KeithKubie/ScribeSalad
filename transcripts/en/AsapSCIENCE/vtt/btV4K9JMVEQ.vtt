00:00:00.299 --> 00:00:04.160
You may have laughed at the idea of 'Silent
But Deadly' farts.

00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:08.740
But is this faint flatulence really more potent
than the boisterous wind you let loose?

00:00:08.740 --> 00:00:10.430
Are silent farts worse?

00:00:10.430 --> 00:00:14.950
It may surprise you to find out that a large
portion of farts are the result of swallowed

00:00:14.950 --> 00:00:15.950
air.

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:19.929
Whether from chewing a lot of gum, drinking
pop, or simply from eating food, excess air

00:00:19.929 --> 00:00:22.429
enters your body and has to go somewhere.

00:00:22.429 --> 00:00:26.029
And while some is released through burping,
the rest ends up in the digestive system and

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:28.329
eventually comes out your other end.

00:00:28.329 --> 00:00:32.890
But when expelled, this gas is made of mostly
nitrogen, hydrogen and carbon dioxide -- all

00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:34.550
of which are odourless.

00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:38.840
Which explains why some farts are obnoxiously
loud, but contain little to no smell.

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:42.039
The second half of the equation is gas from
the large intestine.

00:00:42.039 --> 00:00:46.600
After travelling through 25 feet of small
intestine, the indigestible portions of food

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:48.079
make their way to the colon.

00:00:48.079 --> 00:00:51.730
Here, millions of bacteria feast on the remaining
food, and ferment it.

00:00:51.730 --> 00:00:53.399
And this is where things can get...stinky!

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:58.350
Though the bacteria do release some useful
vitamins, they also produce chemicals containing

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:01.499
sulfur, which is responsible for the smell
in flatulence.

00:01:01.499 --> 00:01:06.060
Add to that a sulfur rich diet with things
like eggs, meat or broccoli, and you're likely

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:08.460
to produce some interesting odours.

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:11.650
The longer these foods stay in the gut, the
more they ferment and smell.

00:01:11.650 --> 00:01:16.170
Still, this smelly portion accounts for around
only 1% of most farts.

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:20.620
In the absence of the other odourless gases,
however, these farts are concentrated with

00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:23.630
smell and generally quiet because there is
less volume.

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:25.650
Silent, but deadly!

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:30.460
Having said that, loud gas can be just as
smelly as the quiet ones, if the sulfur components

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:31.670
are there.

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:36.090
Simply put, your loud farts likely contain
a higher proportion airborne, odourless gases,

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:40.420
whereas the quieter flatulence tends to have
a higher proportion of the smell.

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:42.160
