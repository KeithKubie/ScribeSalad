1
00:00:00,340 --> 00:00:02,050
Feign madness,

2
00:00:03,160 --> 00:00:06,520
but keep your balance hide
behind the mask of a fool,

3
00:00:06,580 --> 00:00:11,580
a drunk or a mad man to create confusion
about your intentions and motivations.

4
00:00:12,490 --> 00:00:17,210
Lower your opponent into underestimating
your ability until overcompensate

5
00:00:17,380 --> 00:00:21,730
overconfident. He drops his
guard, then you may attack.

6
00:00:22,580 --> 00:00:25,900
Yeah, that like the movie white
men can't jump your see that.

7
00:00:27,040 --> 00:00:30,670
So he did it. Woody. Oh, I mean he
made it like he couldn't play ball.

8
00:00:30,920 --> 00:00:34,300
Like he was just this Dork, Jeet,
what he call a chump, whatever.

9
00:00:34,301 --> 00:00:37,150
That's what they'd call him
chump. Like he's Super Dorky.

10
00:00:37,151 --> 00:00:39,790
He goes and everyone else is just so
cool and boom, flashy and all this stuff.

11
00:00:39,791 --> 00:00:43,720
He comes in, he said he's
super nerdy and you know, boom.

12
00:00:43,721 --> 00:00:47,860
Of course they pay a Kim, you know,
kind of thing. And then he beats him.

13
00:00:48,430 --> 00:00:53,050
Would he beat them with flashiness or
would he beat them with, with traditional,

14
00:00:53,770 --> 00:00:58,690
let's call it just who's your style?
Hardworking. Yeah. Basket. Well,

15
00:00:59,080 --> 00:01:03,640
no, he had legitimate skill. He was
like this. So yeah, he'd come in,

16
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:07,680
he'd be Super Dorky. And then, um, he,

17
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:10,930
at first he tricked them. So he
came in the introduction to him,

18
00:01:11,020 --> 00:01:14,590
he was like the acting all Dorky. And
then the guys, the Wesley snipes in them,

19
00:01:14,680 --> 00:01:16,300
they're all playing
basketball in there, you know,

20
00:01:16,330 --> 00:01:17,980
get into a little arguments or whatever.

21
00:01:18,100 --> 00:01:21,670
One guy gets hurt where's Bunyan on and
off something and they're like, hey,

22
00:01:21,671 --> 00:01:24,570
we need another guy. And then the guy
who's like, you know, let's, you know,

23
00:01:24,700 --> 00:01:29,140
get him or whatever. So they're like,
ha ha ha. You know? Yeah, you got him.

24
00:01:29,141 --> 00:01:33,190
Whatever they play, he ends up to
be pretty good, doesn't show a lot,

25
00:01:33,191 --> 00:01:36,580
but he's like pretty solid. And then
they're like, yeah, you guys lucked out.

26
00:01:36,581 --> 00:01:39,670
You had this Dorky guy, you guys kind
of lucked out. And he's like, Oh yeah,

27
00:01:39,671 --> 00:01:42,610
you know, maybe you did look up
or maybe I'm just better than you.

28
00:01:42,760 --> 00:01:45,120
But they're already convinced he's
the stork you got in there like cough,

29
00:01:45,430 --> 00:01:48,160
I'm better than you. He's like, all
right, well let's bet kind of thing.

30
00:01:48,290 --> 00:01:52,120
They're already convinced. Pool sharks
are scenario. Yeah, exactly right.

31
00:01:52,121 --> 00:01:56,740
Same exact thing. Yeah. Yup.
That's pretty obvious one.

32
00:01:56,950 --> 00:01:57,580
And I think,

33
00:01:57,580 --> 00:02:02,580
I think one thing that again to take away
from this is if you know these things,

34
00:02:04,030 --> 00:02:08,740
you're less likely to be suckered
in by them. Yeah, that's,

35
00:02:08,770 --> 00:02:12,010
that's the most important thing. Yeah.
That you see the pool shark thing,

36
00:02:12,220 --> 00:02:15,520
I saw a guy who really
clumsily tried to do that.

37
00:02:15,970 --> 00:02:17,380
He'd worked in night club,

38
00:02:17,381 --> 00:02:21,700
we had a pool table in there and this
guy came in and he like acts like he's

39
00:02:21,701 --> 00:02:23,530
like, he comes in and just a normal guy,

40
00:02:23,531 --> 00:02:28,270
he comes in with his own cue
by the way, his own pool stick,

41
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:32,050
which is an indicator like total giveaway.

42
00:02:32,410 --> 00:02:37,410
And then he comes in and then immediately
when like he kind of enters the little

43
00:02:38,891 --> 00:02:39,611
scene, you know,

44
00:02:39,611 --> 00:02:43,690
the little area where he acts like
he's just kinda drunk and just real

45
00:02:43,691 --> 00:02:46,900
oblivious, you know, he just total
just switches to a different guy.

46
00:02:47,350 --> 00:02:51,910
And here's the thing, we, you can't let
drunk people walk around in the bar.

47
00:02:52,270 --> 00:02:55,630
So you know, when waitresses or
other, or the manager would come by,

48
00:02:55,640 --> 00:02:57,430
they'd be like, Hey, is that
guy that guy's do junk? Like,

49
00:02:57,431 --> 00:03:00,970
why are you kind of like, keep an eye
him? And I'm like, he's not drunk.

50
00:03:00,971 --> 00:03:04,970
He's like acting drunk. I go talk
to him just to sort of make sure,

51
00:03:05,020 --> 00:03:08,410
and he's just like all normal talking
and then like, oh man. But yeah,

52
00:03:08,411 --> 00:03:11,500
he tried no one. I mean, it wasn't
like normal to get money from he,

53
00:03:11,650 --> 00:03:14,470
he wouldn't get money from anyone.
Well, here's the thing. No,

54
00:03:14,530 --> 00:03:18,820
because it was like a nightclub.
It wasn't a competitive pool hall.

55
00:03:18,940 --> 00:03:22,210
No one cares. No one's going to take
his, no one's even going to bet.

56
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:24,490
They're like, Bro, we're just
cruising. Like, why are you, you know,

57
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:26,380
wanting to be that kind of thing.
I'm not saying that happens,

58
00:03:26,381 --> 00:03:28,720
but I'm saying that's the
attitude. In this day and age,

59
00:03:28,721 --> 00:03:32,650
you'd have to be pretty dumb to fall
for this in a pool hall scenario.

60
00:03:33,490 --> 00:03:37,600
Beat this guy. You gotta really think
you could beat him, right? Just be dumb.

61
00:03:38,950 --> 00:03:39,760
All right, next.
