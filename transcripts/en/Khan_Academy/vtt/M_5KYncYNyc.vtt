00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:02.970
I'm now going to introduce
you to the notion of the

00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:04.505
efficiency of an engine.

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:13.900
And it's represented by
the Greek letter eta.

00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:16.360
Even though it sounds like an
e, it looks like a kind of

00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:17.820
funny-looking n.

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:19.920
So Greek letter eta,
this is efficiency.

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:23.060
And efficiency as applies to
engines is kind of similar to

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:24.940
the way we use the word
in our everyday life.

00:00:24.940 --> 00:00:28.160
If I said, how efficient are
you with your time, I care

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:30.610
about, what are you doing with
that hour that I gave you?

00:00:30.610 --> 00:00:32.520
Or if I said, how efficient are
you with your money, I'd

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:35.570
say, how much were you able to
buy with that $100 I gave you?

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:37.770
So efficiency with an engine
is the same thing.

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:41.360
What were you able to do with
the stuff that I gave you?

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:46.100
So in the engine world, we
define efficiency to be, the

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:50.470
work you did with the energy
that I gave you to do the

00:00:50.470 --> 00:00:51.780
work, essentially.

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:54.860
And in our Carnot world, up
here, this is all the stuff

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:58.560
I'd done before, what was the
energy that I had given you?

00:00:58.560 --> 00:01:00.710
Well, the energy that I'd given
you was the energy that

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:03.280
came from this first
reservoir up here.

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:07.690
Remember, when we were moving
the pebbles from A to B, we

00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:10.730
were moving the pebbles to
keep it as a quasistatic

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:14.520
process, so that we can go back,
if we had to, and so

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:16.420
that the system stayed in
equilibrium the whole time.

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:17.980
If we didn't have this
reservoir here, the

00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:19.970
temperature would have gone
down, because we're expanding

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:21.550
the volume, and all of that.

00:01:21.550 --> 00:01:23.070
So we had to keep that
reservoir there.

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:25.580
The added heat to the system,
we figured out this multiple

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:28.540
times, was Q1.

00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:31.250
It was equivalent to the work we
did over that time period,

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:33.210
so it would have been the whole
shaded region, not just

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:34.760
what's inside the circle.

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:37.460
But so the heat that
we gave you was Q1.

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:39.540
You later gave some heat
back, when some work

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:41.310
was done for you.

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:44.950
But what we care about is the
heat that we were given.

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:48.030
So in this case,
it would be Q1.

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:49.720
And what was the work
that you did?

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:53.320
Well, the net work that you
did was the shaded area.

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:56.160
It was the area inside
of our Carnot cycle.

00:01:56.160 --> 00:01:58.240
So that's our definition
for efficiency.

00:01:58.240 --> 00:01:59.630
It's always going to
be a fraction.

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:01.970
Sometimes it's given as a
percentage, where you just,

00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:03.380
you know, this is 0.56.

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:05.500
You would call that
56% efficient.

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:08.800
Which is essentially saying, you
were able to transfer 56%

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:12.690
of the heat energy that you were
given, and turn that into

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:13.720
useful work.

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:17.320
And so it makes sense, at least
in my head, that that

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:20.020
would be the definition
for efficiency.

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:23.550
Now le'ts see if we can play
around with this, and see how

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:25.720
efficiency would play out with
some of the variables we're

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:27.720
dealing with in the
Carnot cycle.

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:30.310
So what was the work
that we did?

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:32.960
Well, we know our definition
of internal energy.

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:36.370
Our definition of internal
energy has been more useful

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:39.380
than you would have thought,
for such a simple equation.

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:46.840
Our change in internal energy is
the net heat applied to the

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:55.640
system minus the work
done by the system.

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:56.420
Right?

00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:59.910
Now, when you complete one
Carnot cycle, when you go from

00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:03.430
a all the way around back to a,
and actually, I'll make a

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:04.060
little aside here.

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:05.020
You could have actually
gone the other

00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:05.910
way around the cycle.

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:09.090
But when you go the way we went
the first time, when you

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:10.980
go clockwise, you're
a Carnot engine.

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:13.330
You're doing work, and
you're transferring

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:16.940
heat from T1 to T2.

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:20.450
If you went the other way
around the circle,

00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:23.430
essentially, you'd be a Carnot
refrigerator, where you would

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:26.080
have work being done to you,
and I'll touch on this in a

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:27.610
second, and you'd
be transferring

00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:28.680
energy the other way.

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:31.690
And this will be important to
our proof of why the Carnot

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:34.980
engine is the best engine, at
least theoretically, from an

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:36.070
efficiency point of view.

00:03:36.070 --> 00:03:38.510
If efficiency is all
you cared about.

00:03:38.510 --> 00:03:39.080
But anyway.

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:40.110
That's what I was
talking about.

00:03:40.110 --> 00:03:43.670
So if I go a complete cycle in
this PV diagram and I end up

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:47.260
back at A, what's my change
in internal energy?

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:48.280
It's 0.

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:51.360
My internal energy is a state
variable, so my change in

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:52.070
internal energy is 0.

00:03:52.070 --> 00:03:53.570
My change in entropy
would also be 0.

00:03:53.570 --> 00:03:57.160
It's another state variable,
when I get from A back to A.

00:03:57.160 --> 00:03:59.950
So over the course of this
cycle, we know that my change

00:03:59.950 --> 00:04:02.220
in internal energy is 0.

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:06.855
What's the net heat applied
to the system?

00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:15.690
Well, we applied Q1 to the
system, and then we

00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:17.720
took out Q2, right?

00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:19.839
We gave that to the
second reservoir.

00:04:19.839 --> 00:04:24.140
We gave that down there to T2,
to that second reservoir.

00:04:24.140 --> 00:04:28.540
And then minus work-- and all
of this is equal to 0.

00:04:28.540 --> 00:04:31.400
This is the net, i just want to
make it clear, this is the

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:33.210
net heat applied
to our system.

00:04:33.210 --> 00:04:38.080
So the work done by the system--
we just add W to both

00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:44.210
sides of this equation, you get
W is equal to Q1 minus Q2.

00:04:44.210 --> 00:04:44.980
So there we have it.

00:04:44.980 --> 00:04:47.440
Let's just substitute
that back here.

00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:53.050
And instead of W, we can write
Q1 minus Q2 as the numerator

00:04:53.050 --> 00:04:56.050
in our in our efficiency
definition, and then the

00:04:56.050 --> 00:04:59.700
denominator is still Q1.

00:04:59.700 --> 00:05:01.280
And we can do a little
bit of math.

00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:03.090
This simplifies-- this is Q1.

00:05:03.090 --> 00:05:04.890
This is the heat
we put into it.

00:05:04.890 --> 00:05:08.040
So it's the net heat we applied
to the system divided

00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:10.070
by the heat we put into it.

00:05:10.070 --> 00:05:14.460
So this is equal to-- Q1
divided by Q1 is 1,

00:05:14.460 --> 00:05:18.960
minus Q2 over Q1.

00:05:18.960 --> 00:05:23.040
So once again, this is another
interesting definition of

00:05:23.040 --> 00:05:23.590
efficiency.

00:05:23.590 --> 00:05:25.730
They're all algebraic
manipulations using the

00:05:25.730 --> 00:05:28.810
definition of internal energy,
and whatever else.

00:05:28.810 --> 00:05:30.900
Now let's see if we can somehow
relate efficiency to

00:05:30.900 --> 00:05:32.760
our temperatures.

00:05:32.760 --> 00:05:35.240
Now, let me-- this is
Q1 right there.

00:05:35.240 --> 00:05:37.920
So what were Q2 and Q1?

00:05:37.920 --> 00:05:38.600
What were they?

00:05:38.600 --> 00:05:41.420
What were their absolute values,
not looking at the

00:05:41.420 --> 00:05:42.150
signs of them?

00:05:42.150 --> 00:05:46.670
I mean, we know that Q2 was
transferred out of the system,

00:05:46.670 --> 00:05:50.200
so if we said Q2 in terms of
the energy applied to the

00:05:50.200 --> 00:05:51.360
system, it would be
a negative number.

00:05:51.360 --> 00:05:53.320
But if we just wanted to know
the magnitude of Q2, what

00:05:53.320 --> 00:05:55.240
would it be, and the
magnitude of Q1?

00:05:55.240 --> 00:05:59.070
Well, the magnitude of Q1--
let me draw a new Carnot

00:05:59.070 --> 00:06:02.730
cycle, just for cleanliness.

00:06:02.730 --> 00:06:05.570
I'll draw a little small
one over here.

00:06:05.570 --> 00:06:06.970
That's my volume axis.

00:06:06.970 --> 00:06:10.360
That's my pressure axis.

00:06:10.360 --> 00:06:12.790
PV.

00:06:12.790 --> 00:06:16.170
I start here at some state, and
then I go isothermally.

00:06:16.170 --> 00:06:19.410
What's a good color for an
isothermal expansion?

00:06:19.410 --> 00:06:20.100
Maybe purple.

00:06:20.100 --> 00:06:21.196
It's kind of-- let's see.

00:06:21.196 --> 00:06:22.850
An isothermal expansion.

00:06:22.850 --> 00:06:25.050
I'm on an isotherm here.

00:06:25.050 --> 00:06:29.290
So I go down there, and I
go to state, and I went

00:06:29.290 --> 00:06:30.300
down to state B.

00:06:30.300 --> 00:06:31.910
So this is A to B.

00:06:31.910 --> 00:06:33.750
And we know we are
an isotherm.

00:06:33.750 --> 00:06:37.830
This is when Q1 was added.

00:06:37.830 --> 00:06:38.910
This is an isotherm.

00:06:38.910 --> 00:06:41.330
If your temperature didn't
change, your internal energy

00:06:41.330 --> 00:06:42.200
didn't change.

00:06:42.200 --> 00:06:46.110
And like I said before, if your
internal energy is 0,

00:06:46.110 --> 00:06:48.970
then the heat applied to the
system is the same as

00:06:48.970 --> 00:06:49.700
the work you did.

00:06:49.700 --> 00:06:50.760
They cancel each other out.

00:06:50.760 --> 00:06:51.880
That's why you got to 0.

00:06:51.880 --> 00:06:55.220
So this Q1 that we apply to the
system, it must be equal

00:06:55.220 --> 00:06:56.520
to the work we did.

00:06:56.520 --> 00:07:01.270
And the work we did is just
the area under this curve.

00:07:01.270 --> 00:07:02.810
We did this multiple times.

00:07:02.810 --> 00:07:04.350
And why is it the area
under the curve?

00:07:04.350 --> 00:07:06.120
Because it's a bunch
of rectangles of

00:07:06.120 --> 00:07:09.770
pressure times volume.

00:07:09.770 --> 00:07:12.320
And then you just add up all
the rectangles, an infinite

00:07:12.320 --> 00:07:13.990
number of infinitely
narrow rectangles,

00:07:13.990 --> 00:07:15.300
and you get the area.

00:07:15.300 --> 00:07:16.540
And what is that?

00:07:16.540 --> 00:07:18.970
Just a review-- pressure times
volume was the work, right?

00:07:18.970 --> 00:07:22.100
Because we're expanding
the cylinder.

00:07:22.100 --> 00:07:23.520
We're moving up that piston.

00:07:23.520 --> 00:07:25.040
We're doing force
times distance.

00:07:25.040 --> 00:07:29.050
So the amount Q1 is equal to
that integral-- the amount of

00:07:29.050 --> 00:07:34.260
work we did as well-- is equal
to the integral from V final--

00:07:34.260 --> 00:07:36.160
I shouldn't say V final.

00:07:36.160 --> 00:07:40.980
from VB, from our volume
at B-- oh sorry.

00:07:40.980 --> 00:07:44.400
From our volume at A
to our volume at B.

00:07:44.400 --> 00:07:48.080
We're starting here, and we're
going to our volume at B.

00:07:48.080 --> 00:07:52.010
And we're taking the integral
of pressure-- and I've done

00:07:52.010 --> 00:07:55.490
this multiple times, but
I'll do it again.

00:07:55.490 --> 00:07:57.080
So the pressure, our
height, times our

00:07:57.080 --> 00:07:59.930
change in volume, dv.

00:07:59.930 --> 00:08:06.270
We go back to our ideal gas
formula, PV is equal to nRT,

00:08:06.270 --> 00:08:08.740
divide both sides by
V, and you get P is

00:08:08.740 --> 00:08:13.050
equal to nRT over V.

00:08:13.050 --> 00:08:20.190
And so you have Q1 is equal to
the integral of VA from VA to

00:08:20.190 --> 00:08:23.560
VB of this little
thing over here.

00:08:23.560 --> 00:08:27.750
nRT over V dv.

00:08:27.750 --> 00:08:29.950
All of this stuff up here,
these are all constants.

00:08:29.950 --> 00:08:31.210
Remember, we're an isotherm.

00:08:31.210 --> 00:08:32.200
Our temperature isn't
changing.

00:08:32.200 --> 00:08:34.260
We could write T1 there,
because that's our

00:08:34.260 --> 00:08:34.950
temperature.

00:08:34.950 --> 00:08:35.820
We're at T1.

00:08:35.820 --> 00:08:38.770
We're on a T1 isotherm right
there, because we're touching

00:08:38.770 --> 00:08:39.980
the T1 reservoir.

00:08:39.980 --> 00:08:41.370
But this is all a constant,
so we can take

00:08:41.370 --> 00:08:42.870
it out of the equation.

00:08:42.870 --> 00:08:46.130
And then we've evaluated this
multiple times, so I won't go

00:08:46.130 --> 00:08:47.600
into the mechanics
of the integral.

00:08:47.600 --> 00:08:55.970
But so this is Q1 is equal to
our constant terms, nRT1 times

00:08:55.970 --> 00:08:56.790
this definite integral.

00:08:56.790 --> 00:08:59.220
All we have left in the integral
is 1 over V The

00:08:59.220 --> 00:09:01.720
antiderivative of that is
natural log, and then you

00:09:01.720 --> 00:09:03.390
evaluated the two boundaries.

00:09:03.390 --> 00:09:11.040
So you get the natural log of VB
minus VA, which is the same

00:09:11.040 --> 00:09:15.450
thing as the natural
log of VB over VA.

00:09:15.450 --> 00:09:16.480
Fair enough.

00:09:16.480 --> 00:09:18.510
This right here is Q1.

00:09:18.510 --> 00:09:18.860
All right.

00:09:18.860 --> 00:09:20.500
Now what is Q2?

00:09:20.500 --> 00:09:23.220
Q2 was this part of
the Carnot cycle.

00:09:23.220 --> 00:09:25.720
Q2 is when we went
from C to D.

00:09:28.540 --> 00:09:33.080
So the magnitude of Q2 is
the area under this

00:09:33.080 --> 00:09:34.330
curve, right here.

00:09:36.680 --> 00:09:39.650
Now this is the work done to of
the system, so that's why

00:09:39.650 --> 00:09:41.770
we subtracted it out when we
wanted to know the net work

00:09:41.770 --> 00:09:43.050
done by the system.

00:09:43.050 --> 00:09:45.510
And we ended up with this area
over here, when you subtracted

00:09:45.510 --> 00:09:47.460
this as well, over here
on this side.

00:09:47.460 --> 00:09:50.180
But if we just want to know the
magnitude of Q2, we just

00:09:50.180 --> 00:09:55.150
take the integral under
this curve.

00:09:55.150 --> 00:09:58.350
And what's the integral
under that curve?

00:09:58.350 --> 00:10:01.370
This is the heat out of the
system, the heat that had to

00:10:01.370 --> 00:10:04.520
be pushed out of the system
as work was done to it.

00:10:04.520 --> 00:10:07.300
So that integral-- so we could
just say, the magnitude of

00:10:07.300 --> 00:10:16.980
Q2-- I'll do it over here-- is
equal to-- the same exact

00:10:16.980 --> 00:10:19.470
logic applies, just the
boundaries are different.

00:10:19.470 --> 00:10:22.240
We're now going from-- and
remember, when we cared about

00:10:22.240 --> 00:10:25.090
the direction, I would say,
I'm going from VC to VD.

00:10:25.090 --> 00:10:28.140
But if I just want to know the
absolute value of that area,

00:10:28.140 --> 00:10:31.900
because I just want to know the
magnitude, I could go from

00:10:31.900 --> 00:10:34.900
VC to VD and just take the
absolute value of it, or I

00:10:34.900 --> 00:10:38.610
could just go from VD to VC, and
I'd get a positive area.

00:10:38.610 --> 00:10:41.350
So let me just do that.

00:10:41.350 --> 00:10:45.910
So it's the integral
from VD to VC.

00:10:45.910 --> 00:10:49.600
Remember, the cycle we went from
VC to VD, but I just want

00:10:49.600 --> 00:10:50.270
the absolute value.

00:10:50.270 --> 00:10:51.550
I want this to be positive.

00:10:51.550 --> 00:10:54.810
So I'm turning it
the other way.

00:10:54.810 --> 00:10:57.580
Of P dv.

00:10:57.580 --> 00:11:00.200
And we do the exact
same math there.

00:11:00.200 --> 00:11:06.050
You get Q2 is equal to
nR-- this time the

00:11:06.050 --> 00:11:07.070
temperature is T2.

00:11:07.070 --> 00:11:09.130
We're on a T2 reservoir.

00:11:09.130 --> 00:11:14.260
Times the natural log--
and this time,

00:11:14.260 --> 00:11:15.420
what's it going to be?

00:11:15.420 --> 00:11:21.150
Times the natural log of--
instead of VB over VA, it's

00:11:21.150 --> 00:11:28.800
going to be VC divided by VD.

00:11:31.900 --> 00:11:34.680
Now let's use these two pieces
of information and substitute

00:11:34.680 --> 00:11:38.450
them back into that results for
efficiency we just got.

00:11:38.450 --> 00:11:41.220
We just learned that you could
also write the efficiency of

00:11:41.220 --> 00:11:46.170
an engine to be equal
to 1 minus Q-- let's

00:11:46.170 --> 00:11:46.930
look back at it.

00:11:46.930 --> 00:11:48.350
1 minus Q2 over Q1.

00:11:53.070 --> 00:11:56.390
So let's substitute Q2 there
and Q1 over here.

00:11:56.390 --> 00:11:57.820
And what do you get?

00:11:57.820 --> 00:12:01.590
You get the efficiency of your
engine is equal to 1 minus--

00:12:01.590 --> 00:12:08.090
Q2 is this expression over
here-- nRT2 times the natural

00:12:08.090 --> 00:12:20.100
log of VC over VD, all of that
divided by Q1, which is this

00:12:20.100 --> 00:12:21.186
one over here.

00:12:21.186 --> 00:12:29.720
nRT1 times the natural
log of VB over VA.

00:12:29.720 --> 00:12:31.680
Now we can do a little
bit of canceling.

00:12:31.680 --> 00:12:34.800
Obviously the n and
the r is cancel.

00:12:34.800 --> 00:12:36.930
And we have these natural
logs and all of that.

00:12:36.930 --> 00:12:41.300
But I had a whole video
dedicated to show you that VC

00:12:41.300 --> 00:12:46.370
over dv is equal
to VB over VA.

00:12:46.370 --> 00:12:48.450
Now, if we know that these
are equal, then

00:12:48.450 --> 00:12:49.460
this is equal to this.

00:12:49.460 --> 00:12:50.840
So the natural logs
of them are equal,

00:12:50.840 --> 00:12:52.260
so we can just divide.

00:12:52.260 --> 00:12:53.850
And what are we left with?

00:12:53.850 --> 00:12:57.350
We're left with the fact that
efficiency can also be written

00:12:57.350 --> 00:13:08.550
as 1 minus T2 over T1
for a Carnot engine.

00:13:08.550 --> 00:13:11.980
Remember, this time, what we did
over here, this applied to

00:13:11.980 --> 00:13:12.970
any engine.

00:13:12.970 --> 00:13:16.130
This was just a little bit of
math and the definition of

00:13:16.130 --> 00:13:20.950
what work is, and-- well,
I won't go too much

00:13:20.950 --> 00:13:21.850
into it right now.

00:13:21.850 --> 00:13:24.490
But this is for a Carnot
engine, right?

00:13:24.490 --> 00:13:26.580
Because we did a little bit of
work here that involved the

00:13:26.580 --> 00:13:28.020
Carnot cycle.

00:13:28.020 --> 00:13:30.850
But this is a pretty bit
important outcome, because

00:13:30.850 --> 00:13:33.600
we're going to show that the
Carnot engine, in the next

00:13:33.600 --> 00:13:36.800
video, is actually the most
efficient engine that can ever

00:13:36.800 --> 00:13:37.870
be attained.

00:13:37.870 --> 00:13:40.150
Well, you have to be very
careful about that, that when

00:13:40.150 --> 00:13:42.940
we say efficient, it means that
between two temperature

00:13:42.940 --> 00:13:48.430
sources, you can't get a more
efficient engine than the

00:13:48.430 --> 00:13:49.070
Carnot engine.

00:13:49.070 --> 00:13:50.620
Now, I'm not saying it's the
best engine, or it's a

00:13:50.620 --> 00:13:53.630
practical engine, or you'd want
it to power your lawn

00:13:53.630 --> 00:13:56.050
mower or your jet plane.

00:13:56.050 --> 00:13:59.320
I'm just saying that it's the
most efficient engine between

00:13:59.320 --> 00:14:01.340
these two temperature
reservoirs.

00:14:01.340 --> 00:14:03.770
And I'll show you that
in the next video.
