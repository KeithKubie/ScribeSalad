CHERIE HANNOUCHE: Good
afternoon, everyone.

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:04.400
And thank you guys so
much for coming out, even

00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:05.860
with the weather.

00:00:05.860 --> 00:00:07.730
My name is Cherie
Hannouche, and I

00:00:07.730 --> 00:00:11.950
work in the education team in
Large Customer Sales for GBO.

00:00:11.950 --> 00:00:15.480
And I am thrilled today to
introduce two-time Pulitzer

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:19.230
Prize winner, Nicholas Kristof,
and award-winning producer

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:22.780
and head of Show of
Force, Mira Chang.

00:00:22.780 --> 00:00:26.130
Today we're going to talk a
little bit about their newest

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:30.090
documentary, "A Path Appears--
Transforming Lives and Creating

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:33.600
Opportunity," which is based
on the book of the same title

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:37.349
that Nicholas wrote with
his wife, Sheryl WuDunn.

00:00:37.349 --> 00:00:38.890
So I'm going to tell
you a little bit

00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:40.030
about the documentary.

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:43.430
We're going to play a quick
clip and then bring them up.

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:47.980
So the actual documentary
follows advocates and actors,

00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:51.830
including Malin Akerman,
Blake Lively, Jennifer Garner,

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:57.420
Mia Farrow, Alfre Woodard, as
they travel to Kenya, Colombia,

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:00.290
Haiti, as well as
the United States.

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:02.890
And they uncovered different
parts of human rights

00:01:02.890 --> 00:01:05.440
violations and the
effective solutions

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:08.870
being implemented
to combat them.

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:11.700
Nicholas Kristof is an
award-winning journalist,

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:14.760
a recognized humanitarian,
a bestselling author,

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:17.310
and a "New York
Times" columnist.

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:20.760
In 1990, he won a Pulitzer
with his wife Sheryl WuDunn,

00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:23.880
for their coverage of
China's Tiananmen Square.

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:28.070
He won a second Pulitzer
in 2006 for his columns

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:30.290
on the genocide in
Darfur, that are

00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:32.910
said to have single-handedly
focused Americans

00:01:32.910 --> 00:01:36.650
on the attention and atrocities
committed during that time.

00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:40.170
Nicholas has been credited for
reshaping the field of opinion

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:42.850
journalism and for
being, and I quote,

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:46.159
"the conscience of
international journalism."

00:01:46.159 --> 00:01:47.700
Through his writings
and initiatives,

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:50.480
he's done a lot to shine a
light on gender oppression,

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:54.240
human rights violations, and
social and economic justice

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:56.930
around the world, and
call on us to do our share

00:01:56.930 --> 00:01:59.890
to make the world
a better place.

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:02.740
Mira Chang is a producer,
director, and director

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:04.970
of photography of
nonfiction content

00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:07.370
for domestic and
international television,

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:10.060
and several full-length
documentaries, as well.

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:13.990
Her work can be seen regularly
on ABC, National Geographic,

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:17.250
A&amp;E, and Discovery, and
she's been nominated

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:20.620
for several Emmys, as
well as Academy Awards.

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:24.615
Mira also produced the landmark
four-hour PBS documentary,

00:02:24.615 --> 00:02:28.010
"Half the Sky-- Turning
Oppression Into Opportunity

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:30.090
for Women Worldwide,"
which was based

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:31.950
on the bestselling book
with the same title

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:34.510
that Nicholas and
his wife wrote.

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:37.560
She's currently heading up the
development at Show of Force.

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:39.640
And we've got some of
them here with us today.

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:41.920
So welcome.

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:45.680
And they are the creative
enterprise behind two PBS

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:47.970
documentaries with
Kristof, and a number

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:51.080
of Emmy-winning
projects, as well.

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:54.730
So I'm going to just show
a quick clip of the trailer

00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:58.660
of the three-part series,
which is airing tonight on PBS,

00:02:58.660 --> 00:03:00.331
as well as next Monday.

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:09.120
-Our new project is
called, "A Path Appears."

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:12.980
The title is from Lu Xun,
a prominent Chinese writer,

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:16.240
who said that hope is like
a path in the countryside.

00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:17.910
At first, there is no path.

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:20.010
But as more and
more people walk,

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:23.216
again and again, a path appears.

00:03:23.216 --> 00:03:24.680
Meaning a solution appears.

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:29.360
It's about innovative strategies
for making a difference.

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:30.770
In "Half the Sky,"
we were asking

00:03:30.770 --> 00:03:33.100
how do you begin
to tackle seemingly

00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:34.360
insurmountable problems?

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:37.400
Is that red door-- is that
a brothel, do we think?

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:38.216
-Yes, it is.

00:03:38.216 --> 00:03:39.590
-She doesn't have
a radial pulse.

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:40.250
-Just stay safe, OK?

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:42.420
-In "A Path Appears," we
take it to a new level.

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:44.785
We actually look at the
roots of vulnerability.

00:03:44.785 --> 00:03:47.750
And we talk about solutions
that really address those roots.

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:50.430
-It's easier to look at
problems outside the country

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:53.100
than it is to look at
stuff in our own backyard.

00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:55.534
-More than 300,000 girls
go missing each year.

00:03:55.534 --> 00:03:56.450
-In the United States?

00:03:56.450 --> 00:03:57.220
-In the US.

00:03:57.220 --> 00:04:00.800
And 100,000 of them are
sold for sex in some form.

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:04.560
-Nick and Sheryl use stories
to capture attention.

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:08.030
-Police.

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:08.900
You're under arrest.

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:09.570

-That's not the reality.

This is the reality.

00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:21.548
-Like, every day.

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:27.020
-Because stories are powerful.

-That's her.

we see it, is poverty.

just not having enough money.

I don't know if I've seen
this much despair before.

00:08:32.070 --> 00:08:35.481
Where does the actual
title come from?

00:08:35.481 --> 00:08:36.980
NICHOLAS KRISTOF:
So let me tell you

00:08:36.980 --> 00:08:38.840
about the origins of the book.

00:08:38.840 --> 00:08:47.320
After Sheryl and I-- and
Sheryl sends her regrets--

00:08:47.320 --> 00:08:50.840
I hate to admit this in the
discussion of gender equality,

00:08:50.840 --> 00:08:53.940
but she's actually
at home, probably

00:08:53.940 --> 00:08:57.680
right now shoveling
our driveway.

00:08:57.680 --> 00:09:01.200
So I got the better end
of the stick right here.

00:09:01.200 --> 00:09:03.450
And so she sends her regards.

00:09:03.450 --> 00:09:06.850
She would much rather, I
think, be here, as well.

00:09:06.850 --> 00:09:08.410
But after we wrote
"Half the Sky,"

00:09:08.410 --> 00:09:10.290
and after the "Half
the Sky" documentary

00:09:10.290 --> 00:09:13.524
that Mira had also
worked on, then that

00:09:13.524 --> 00:09:15.440
had really focused on
empowering women abroad.

00:09:15.440 --> 00:09:17.689
And after that, we got a
couple of kinds of questions.

00:09:17.689 --> 00:09:20.710
One, what about the situation
right here in the US?

00:09:20.710 --> 00:09:23.200
And secondly, so what can I do?

00:09:23.200 --> 00:09:24.460
What are the solutions?

00:09:24.460 --> 00:09:28.260
And we wanted to
come back and look

00:09:28.260 --> 00:09:31.410
at ways one can
make a difference.

00:09:31.410 --> 00:09:35.900
It does seem to us that,
by and large, people

00:09:35.900 --> 00:09:40.480
do want to find a little
more purpose in life,

00:09:40.480 --> 00:09:43.540
make a difference-- especially
millennials, for that matter.

00:09:43.540 --> 00:09:46.160
And that there really is
evidence now about what works,

00:09:46.160 --> 00:09:48.040
what doesn't work.

00:09:48.040 --> 00:09:50.920
And that there
are-- sometimes it

00:09:50.920 --> 00:09:55.280
becomes a little bit too easy
to point to problems abroad,

00:09:55.280 --> 00:09:59.000
when we also have huge
problems right here.

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:01.290
It's too easy to pit
them against each other

00:10:01.290 --> 00:10:05.390
and say, either we should
solve our own problems first,

00:10:05.390 --> 00:10:11.820
before worrying about Tanzania,
or to say the opposite--

00:10:11.820 --> 00:10:13.900
that we should just
focus on problems abroad.

00:10:13.900 --> 00:10:16.070
There are huge problems
both here and abroad,

00:10:16.070 --> 00:10:18.560
and we wanted to
offer some windows

00:10:18.560 --> 00:10:22.330
into how to address them.

00:10:22.330 --> 00:10:24.950
MIRA CHANG: And a lot of those
problems people just don't see.

00:10:24.950 --> 00:10:26.700
When we were talking
about "Half the Sky,"

00:10:26.700 --> 00:10:29.870
and were talking about maternal
mortality, and trafficking,

00:10:29.870 --> 00:10:32.610
violence against women,
people don't even

00:10:32.610 --> 00:10:35.260
know the extent of what
happens here in the US.

00:10:35.260 --> 00:10:38.170
And even back when "Half
the Sky" was being produced,

00:10:38.170 --> 00:10:40.370
we kept thinking
about it would be

00:10:40.370 --> 00:10:42.710
amazing to be able to
shed light on what's

00:10:42.710 --> 00:10:43.960
happening here in our country.

00:10:43.960 --> 00:10:46.920
Because I don't think it's
really discussed a lot.

00:10:46.920 --> 00:10:50.590
So that was one of our hopes
for "A Path Appears," as well.

00:10:50.590 --> 00:10:53.397
And then hopefully, people
walk away with that.

00:10:53.397 --> 00:10:55.980
CHERIE HANNOUCHE: I like, also,
the different ways that you're

00:10:55.980 --> 00:10:57.610
also reaching those audiences.

00:10:57.610 --> 00:10:58.700
You mention Millennials.

00:10:58.700 --> 00:11:00.740
And I think, of
course, Millenials

00:11:00.740 --> 00:11:04.530
do get this bad rap of being
lazy or not as involved.

00:11:04.530 --> 00:11:07.000
And yet, even in 2014,
there were reports

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:08.770
from the Millennial
path report that

00:11:08.770 --> 00:11:13.100
talked about the high
percentages of Millennials

00:11:13.100 --> 00:11:15.620
who have given back, and who
have volunteered their time,

00:11:15.620 --> 00:11:17.620
and have made contributions.

00:11:17.620 --> 00:11:19.420
What are some of
the ways that we

00:11:19.420 --> 00:11:24.420
can communicate to Millennials
to encourage them to give back?

00:11:24.420 --> 00:11:28.380
NICHOLAS KRISTOF: So there
is apathappears.org website

00:11:28.380 --> 00:11:31.360
that does list some
ways of engaging.

00:11:31.360 --> 00:11:34.090
And likewise, in
the back of the book

00:11:34.090 --> 00:11:36.247
there are a bunch of
great organizations,

00:11:36.247 --> 00:11:38.830
as well as a list of things you
can do in the next 10 minutes,

00:11:38.830 --> 00:11:40.950
for example.

00:11:40.950 --> 00:11:44.672
And what you choose,
there's no one right answer

00:11:44.672 --> 00:11:45.380
about what to do.

00:11:45.380 --> 00:11:48.160
It depends a little bit
what you care about,

00:11:48.160 --> 00:11:50.092
what your passions are.

00:11:50.092 --> 00:11:51.800
Broadly, there are
three kinds of things.

00:11:51.800 --> 00:11:53.940
You can donate,
you can volunteer,

00:11:53.940 --> 00:11:57.019
or you can engage in advocacy.

00:11:57.019 --> 00:11:58.560
On the issue of
Millenials, though, I

00:11:58.560 --> 00:12:03.350
think one of the things that
corporate America hasn't woken

00:12:03.350 --> 00:12:06.580
up to is that corporations
really can do,

00:12:06.580 --> 00:12:09.970
I think, a much better job with
corporate social responsibility

00:12:09.970 --> 00:12:11.190
programs.

00:12:11.190 --> 00:12:14.390
And so far, CSR has
been kind of a joke--

00:12:14.390 --> 00:12:16.280
really window dressing, largely.

00:12:16.280 --> 00:12:20.710
And it would be great
if the tech sector

00:12:20.710 --> 00:12:23.690
showed some real
leadership here.

00:12:23.690 --> 00:12:25.330
Partly because so
many of the employees

00:12:25.330 --> 00:12:28.770
are millennials,
because companies

00:12:28.770 --> 00:12:31.630
tend to emphasize values,
have brands they care about.

00:12:31.630 --> 00:12:35.980
And in fact, the tech sector
has underperformed, I'd say,

00:12:35.980 --> 00:12:36.967
in CSR.

00:12:36.967 --> 00:12:38.550
CHERIE HANNOUCHE:
And it's interesting

00:12:38.550 --> 00:12:41.780
because, at Google, I think we
are very fortunate that we have

00:12:41.780 --> 00:12:44.750
different ways to give
back-- our GoogleServe, which

00:12:44.750 --> 00:12:46.900
is a week dedicated
to giving back,

00:12:46.900 --> 00:12:48.780
as well as a Google
match program.

00:12:48.780 --> 00:12:51.220
But as you mentioned,
not all tech companies

00:12:51.220 --> 00:12:53.870
have that on par, and that
has been very important

00:12:53.870 --> 00:12:54.540
for Millennials.

00:12:54.540 --> 00:12:57.470
They really do care about
the type of organization

00:12:57.470 --> 00:12:59.770
that they work for and
what they stand for.

00:12:59.770 --> 00:13:02.040
What are some ways-- can
you talk a little bit more

00:13:02.040 --> 00:13:05.040
about some ways that Silicon
Valley or tech companies

00:13:05.040 --> 00:13:06.940
can stand up?

00:13:06.940 --> 00:13:12.930
NICHOLAS KRISTOF: Well, I
think that a CSR program that

00:13:12.930 --> 00:13:18.140
actually involved employees,
that gave them a choice,

00:13:18.140 --> 00:13:19.980
gave them a vote--
do you want to adopt

00:13:19.980 --> 00:13:22.140
this cause, or that
cause, gave them

00:13:22.140 --> 00:13:27.574
a chance to volunteer in East
Palo Alto-- where I don't what

00:13:27.574 --> 00:13:29.490
proportion of kids are
below the poverty line,

00:13:29.490 --> 00:13:34.160
but is right next door to so
many very successful companies.

00:13:34.160 --> 00:13:37.180
And on some of
the issues that we

00:13:37.180 --> 00:13:41.410
talk about in the documentary or
in the book-- sex trafficking.

00:13:41.410 --> 00:13:45.610
It would be incredibly powerful
if there were tools addressed

00:13:45.610 --> 00:13:49.230
to-- I mean, these kids
are advertised on the web.

00:13:49.230 --> 00:13:54.571
And I think that reflects kind
of an acquiescence on our part

00:13:54.571 --> 00:13:55.820
that these girls don't matter.

00:13:55.820 --> 00:14:01.720
We would not allow fully
automatic machine guns,

00:14:01.720 --> 00:14:05.450
or RPGs to be sold on the web,
or large quantities of meth.

00:14:05.450 --> 00:14:08.490
Silk Road is now closed
down for that reason.

00:14:08.490 --> 00:14:11.910
But we do allow 100,000 girls
each year, approximately--

00:14:11.910 --> 00:14:14.520
underage girls-- to
be sold on the web,

00:14:14.520 --> 00:14:16.010
on organizations like BackPage.

00:14:16.010 --> 00:14:17.361
.

00:14:17.361 --> 00:14:18.860
I think it's a
function of priority.

00:14:18.860 --> 00:14:22.560
So I'd love to see
companies get involved

00:14:22.560 --> 00:14:25.540
to try to provide tools to
address this, provide volunteer

00:14:25.540 --> 00:14:30.230
opportunities, and ways of
engaging employees in such

00:14:30.230 --> 00:14:33.410
that that would, I
think, boost the brand,

00:14:33.410 --> 00:14:37.110
and boost morale, and
create a-- and I think

00:14:37.110 --> 00:14:38.990
it used to be that
the way we engage

00:14:38.990 --> 00:14:41.031
was we would write checks
at the end of the year.

00:14:41.031 --> 00:14:43.971
I think that, more and
more, for your generation,

00:14:43.971 --> 00:14:45.470
you are trying to
make a difference,

00:14:45.470 --> 00:14:48.240
not just by writing checks
but in the consumer decisions

00:14:48.240 --> 00:14:51.350
you're making-- what you buy,
and the company that you work

00:14:51.350 --> 00:14:54.500
for, in the
investments you make.

00:14:54.500 --> 00:14:57.710
And I don't think the corporate
sector has fully woken up

00:14:57.710 --> 00:15:00.690
to the benefits
from really engaging

00:15:00.690 --> 00:15:03.230
in ways that would help
recruitment and retention,

00:15:03.230 --> 00:15:05.430
and actually be in
their own as well.

00:15:05.430 --> 00:15:06.680
CHERIE HANNOUCHE: Interesting.

00:15:06.680 --> 00:15:10.290
I think one of things on that,
because the three-part series--

00:15:10.290 --> 00:15:13.480
it actually aired, the
first part, last Monday.

00:15:13.480 --> 00:15:16.530
And we had a small
Google session

00:15:16.530 --> 00:15:20.130
of people who talked
about the first part

00:15:20.130 --> 00:15:21.890
the next day at breakfast.

00:15:21.890 --> 00:15:23.890
And one of the things
that actually surprised me

00:15:23.890 --> 00:15:28.720
was how many people shared
the same sentiments of some

00:15:28.720 --> 00:15:31.440
of the advocates and
actors in the piece,

00:15:31.440 --> 00:15:33.490
of not knowing that
this is happening

00:15:33.490 --> 00:15:38.830
in your backyard in the US--
Boston, Nashville, right there.

00:15:38.830 --> 00:15:40.479
I think that's one
of the things that--

00:15:40.479 --> 00:15:42.770
NICHOLAS KRISTOF: Or Times
Square, if we're right here.

00:15:42.770 --> 00:15:44.310
CHERIE HANNOUCHE: Exactly.

00:15:44.310 --> 00:15:45.810
What are some of
the things that you

00:15:45.810 --> 00:15:48.226
think-- what are some of the
reasons you think that that's

00:15:48.226 --> 00:15:50.950
not being shared or
broadcasted as much?

00:15:50.950 --> 00:15:53.490
And people are thinking it's
happening in India, or very far

00:15:53.490 --> 00:15:53.989
away.

00:15:56.400 --> 00:16:00.926
NICHOLAS KRISTOF: And I think
there are two misunderstandings

00:16:00.926 --> 00:16:02.800
that we have about sex
trafficking in the US.

00:16:02.800 --> 00:16:05.095
One is we tend to think it
involves foreign women being

00:16:05.095 --> 00:16:05.970
smuggled into the US.

00:16:05.970 --> 00:16:06.636
And that's real.

00:16:06.636 --> 00:16:09.730
That happens, especially both
with Asians and with Latinas,

00:16:09.730 --> 00:16:10.550
in particular.

00:16:10.550 --> 00:16:13.000
But the bigger part
of the problem,

00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:15.810
and especially involving
underage girls,

00:16:15.810 --> 00:16:17.260
is homegrown American girls.

00:16:17.260 --> 00:16:21.710
And this is-- obviously, it
involves all kinds of girls.

00:16:21.710 --> 00:16:25.140
But often, it's girls
who have grown up

00:16:25.140 --> 00:16:27.210
in disadvantaged communities.

00:16:27.210 --> 00:16:29.940
They may have endured sexual
abuse at a very young age

00:16:29.940 --> 00:16:32.370
and they have
self-esteem issues.

00:16:32.370 --> 00:16:34.960
And then, typically, they have
maybe a tough relationship

00:16:34.960 --> 00:16:36.010
with their mom.

00:16:36.010 --> 00:16:37.730
Then Mom's boyfriend
is hitting on them.

00:16:37.730 --> 00:16:41.020
They run away at age 13 to
say, the Port Authority.

00:16:41.020 --> 00:16:43.260
And who's looking
for them there?

00:16:43.260 --> 00:16:44.800
It's the pimps.

00:16:44.800 --> 00:16:52.570
And so 100,000 underage kids
a year-- well, 1.6 million

00:16:52.570 --> 00:16:54.800
are runaway each
year in the US--

00:16:54.800 --> 00:16:58.860
and of those, about 100,000 are
trafficked into the sex trade.

00:16:58.860 --> 00:17:01.550
And I think the other
misunderstanding we have is we

00:17:01.550 --> 00:17:06.520
see a 15-year-old girl
out on the street.

00:17:06.520 --> 00:17:09.200
She's wearing
inappropriate clothing.

00:17:09.200 --> 00:17:12.010
Nobody's holding
a gun to her head.

00:17:12.010 --> 00:17:16.140
We assume that she is there
because she wants to be.

00:17:16.140 --> 00:17:19.210
And it is so much more
complicated than that.

00:17:19.210 --> 00:17:24.430
And it's true that
it's not as if she

00:17:24.430 --> 00:17:27.770
is physically being
handcuffed to a radiator,

00:17:27.770 --> 00:17:31.364
or locked up in a closet
somewhere-- and that happens,

00:17:31.364 --> 00:17:32.530
but that's much less common.

00:17:32.530 --> 00:17:36.520
But the kinds of control, and
coercion, and intimidation,

00:17:36.520 --> 00:17:42.710
and violence that control these
teenage girls are very real

00:17:42.710 --> 00:17:47.100
and make it far from this sort
of happy, voluntary situation

00:17:47.100 --> 00:17:49.150
that we tend to impute to it.

00:17:49.150 --> 00:17:49.850
Do you--

00:17:49.850 --> 00:17:51.349
MIRA CHANG: I think
that a lot of it

00:17:51.349 --> 00:17:53.760
is changing for the better,
in terms of awareness.

00:17:53.760 --> 00:17:55.350
But there's still
a long way to go.

00:17:55.350 --> 00:17:57.950
I think, maybe 10 years
ago, I did a documentary

00:17:57.950 --> 00:18:00.550
about teen prostitutes,
where today we

00:18:00.550 --> 00:18:03.740
would call it trafficking.

00:18:03.740 --> 00:18:06.070
So I think a lot of
it is that there's

00:18:06.070 --> 00:18:11.050
some perception from the public
that the idea of prostitution

00:18:11.050 --> 00:18:13.160
has a lot of choice
involved in it.

00:18:13.160 --> 00:18:16.617
But when you speak to
the trafficking survivors

00:18:16.617 --> 00:18:18.450
or prostitutes who have
been arrested, like,

00:18:18.450 --> 00:18:21.990
160 times, it always goes
back-- if you peel back

00:18:21.990 --> 00:18:24.750
the layers-- to some
really common roots

00:18:24.750 --> 00:18:30.400
about difficult home lives,
and a great deal of abuse,

00:18:30.400 --> 00:18:33.240
sexual and otherwise,
from an early age.

00:18:33.240 --> 00:18:35.740
So we have to start thinking
about it differently, and also

00:18:35.740 --> 00:18:38.380
understanding that there's
not one thing to do.

00:18:38.380 --> 00:18:41.530
We worked a lot with law
enforcement, and all of them

00:18:41.530 --> 00:18:44.030
are trying to figure out
now how to approach it.

00:18:44.030 --> 00:18:46.740
And they realize it's
not just one thing.

00:18:46.740 --> 00:18:48.350
They need to work
with survivors.

00:18:48.350 --> 00:18:51.530
They need to work with
the justice system.

00:18:51.530 --> 00:18:54.290
And they need to treat the
demand side differently.

00:18:54.290 --> 00:18:55.760
So yeah.

00:18:55.760 --> 00:18:56.960
I think things are changing.

00:18:56.960 --> 00:19:01.340
But it's a lot about
awareness and understanding

00:19:01.340 --> 00:19:03.100
that these issues
are taking place,

00:19:03.100 --> 00:19:05.806
and how you could, just
by understanding it

00:19:05.806 --> 00:19:08.849
in a different way,
help move it a bit.

00:19:08.849 --> 00:19:10.890
CHERIE HANNOUCHE: It seems
like awareness is key.

00:19:10.890 --> 00:19:13.590
But then also, as you
mentioned, those complications.

00:19:13.590 --> 00:19:16.700
That it's not something that
you might see on the street,

00:19:16.700 --> 00:19:18.480
what's actually really there.

00:19:18.480 --> 00:19:21.280
And in the documentary
from last Monday,

00:19:21.280 --> 00:19:23.020
there was one scene
that-- we'd love

00:19:23.020 --> 00:19:24.680
to just show a clip of that.

00:19:24.680 --> 00:19:27.590
That just really painted
a very clear picture

00:19:27.590 --> 00:19:29.020
of what's happening.

00:19:29.020 --> 00:19:32.550
And it tells the story of a
young girl named Savannah.

00:19:32.550 --> 00:19:35.356
I just want to show
that clip real quick.

00:19:35.356 --> 00:19:36.344
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:19:36.344 --> 00:19:38.814
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:19:49.188 --> 00:19:53.660
-Thank you, guys, for sitting
down and talking to to me, too.

00:19:53.660 --> 00:19:54.160
-Sure.

00:19:54.160 --> 00:19:55.732
-I really appreciate it.

00:19:55.732 --> 00:19:57.190
-Ms. Savannah's
just got back home.

00:19:57.190 --> 00:20:00.400
She was in a group
home for a while.

00:20:00.400 --> 00:20:01.260
For--

00:20:01.260 --> 00:20:03.850
-Well, I was in a
hospital for nine months.

00:20:03.850 --> 00:20:05.735
And then a group home
for, like, three.

00:20:05.735 --> 00:20:08.800
-When we have visits this
is kind of what we do.

00:20:08.800 --> 00:20:11.440
We'll meet at, like,
a coffee shop--

00:20:11.440 --> 00:20:13.944
-Savannah is a
17-year-old girl who

00:20:13.944 --> 00:20:15.360
turned out to have
been trafficked

00:20:15.360 --> 00:20:19.530
when she was just 13, and
who ultimately was locked up

00:20:19.530 --> 00:20:23.100
in a house by a pimp,
and truly enslaved,

00:20:23.100 --> 00:20:24.440
in any sense of that word.

00:20:24.440 --> 00:20:27.830
-So one day, I think I
was 13, I didn't really

00:20:27.830 --> 00:20:29.580
know a lot about anything.

00:20:29.580 --> 00:20:32.622
So I went online
and I wanted to-- I

00:20:32.622 --> 00:20:34.080
don't know how I
came across, like,

00:20:34.080 --> 00:20:37.219
this website for,
like, sugar daddies.

00:20:37.219 --> 00:20:38.760
Guys would pay for
your stuff and you

00:20:38.760 --> 00:20:40.320
would have sex with them.

00:20:40.320 --> 00:20:42.659
I didn't know that I would
have to have sex with them.

00:20:42.659 --> 00:20:44.200
I just thought they
were going to-- I

00:20:44.200 --> 00:20:45.491
don't know what I was thinking.

00:20:45.491 --> 00:20:49.370
But I just thought that
they would buy me stuff,

00:20:49.370 --> 00:20:50.800
just because I was pretty.

00:20:50.800 --> 00:20:51.920
I don't know.

00:20:51.920 --> 00:20:53.440
But yeah, he took me shopping.

00:20:53.440 --> 00:20:56.530
And then we went--
and I still did not

00:20:56.530 --> 00:20:59.600
understand what was
happening, like, completely.

00:20:59.600 --> 00:21:04.030
Even when we went to the
hotel room, until it happened.

00:21:04.030 --> 00:21:07.100
And then I was still a virgin.

00:21:07.100 --> 00:21:09.400
But that was my first
time with an old guy.

00:21:09.400 --> 00:21:13.770
And he said he was
taking some pictures.

00:21:13.770 --> 00:21:18.760
And I knew-- like, I knew what
kind of pictures they would be,

00:21:18.760 --> 00:21:19.900
like, I thought.

00:21:19.900 --> 00:21:24.230
But I didn't really know that
they would be put it online

00:21:24.230 --> 00:21:27.040
and I would be doing
all this other stuff.

00:21:27.040 --> 00:21:30.930
-Society's idea of what a
woman is that sells her body--

00:21:30.930 --> 00:21:34.150
you think of this woman who
is, like, hardened and callous,

00:21:34.150 --> 00:21:35.840
and she doesn't care.

00:21:35.840 --> 00:21:38.590
But when you think of that,
you don't think of someone

00:21:38.590 --> 00:21:40.980
like Savannah, who's
done all of those things

00:21:40.980 --> 00:21:43.520
that we think of a
prostitute as doing.

00:21:43.520 --> 00:21:46.210
You don't ever think of someone
being vulnerable, and being

00:21:46.210 --> 00:21:48.760
broken, and wanting to
get out of that life,

00:21:48.760 --> 00:21:50.500
and wanting to be a
little girl again.

00:21:50.500 --> 00:21:52.300
You don't think of
them as little girls.

00:21:52.300 --> 00:21:55.630
-He hit me a few times.

00:21:55.630 --> 00:21:58.380
And then he had a gun
and he pointed it at me.

00:21:58.380 --> 00:22:00.630
And he was, like, you
need to do what I say.

00:22:00.630 --> 00:22:02.500
He was, like, I will kill you.

00:22:02.500 --> 00:22:06.330
He thought that the moment
he put the gun to my head,

00:22:06.330 --> 00:22:11.630
like, he had me-- that
I wasn't going to leave.

00:22:11.630 --> 00:22:14.750
-To see Savannah
was to see the face

00:22:14.750 --> 00:22:17.900
of the reality of what
it is in our country.

00:22:17.900 --> 00:22:20.950
And that was the most
profound thing for me.

00:22:20.950 --> 00:22:23.070
-You think about
your partner, who

00:22:23.070 --> 00:22:27.600
you love and love
having sex with.

00:22:27.600 --> 00:22:30.070
You think about having to
have sex with that person

00:22:30.070 --> 00:22:35.280
that you love and adore,
10 to 20 times a day.

00:22:35.280 --> 00:22:39.170
Now think about survivors
and kids in the life.

00:22:39.170 --> 00:22:43.960
They have to sleep with 10
to 20 strangers per night.

00:22:43.960 --> 00:22:46.030
Who would ever choose to
do something like that?

00:22:46.030 --> 00:22:47.030
[END PLAYBACK]

00:22:48.212 --> 00:22:50.170
CHERIE HANNOUCHE: I think
when we look at that,

00:22:50.170 --> 00:22:53.640
that in itself shows some of the
differences of those subtleties

00:22:53.640 --> 00:22:56.980
and complexities we see
happening in the US versus some

00:22:56.980 --> 00:22:58.570
of the other parts of the world.

00:22:58.570 --> 00:23:03.570
But the documentary does explore
Kenya, and Haiti, and Colombia.

00:23:03.570 --> 00:23:05.760
What are some of the
differences, when we're

00:23:05.760 --> 00:23:09.692
looking at those global issues
and gender inequalities,

00:23:09.692 --> 00:23:10.900
between the different places?

00:23:15.840 --> 00:23:19.100
NICHOLAS KRISTOF: There's no
doubt that poverty in America

00:23:19.100 --> 00:23:22.200
starts at a material
level and an education

00:23:22.200 --> 00:23:23.770
level that is much greater.

00:23:23.770 --> 00:23:25.820
So there are plenty
of people who

00:23:25.820 --> 00:23:32.970
are poor in America who have a
vehicle, who have a home that

00:23:32.970 --> 00:23:38.169
is more than just a shack,
that has electricity,

00:23:38.169 --> 00:23:38.960
this kind of thing.

00:23:38.960 --> 00:23:42.670
They're probably going
to go to school, at least

00:23:42.670 --> 00:23:45.000
until high school.

00:23:45.000 --> 00:23:46.750
While in much of the
rest of the world,

00:23:46.750 --> 00:23:48.166
they may be
completely illiterate,

00:23:48.166 --> 00:23:51.130
have no electricity,
this kind of thing.

00:23:51.130 --> 00:23:53.590
But there is a commonality.

00:23:53.590 --> 00:23:57.250
And I think that too often,
we tend to measure poverty

00:23:57.250 --> 00:24:01.010
with metrics of
income or wealth.

00:24:01.010 --> 00:24:04.240
In many ways, the
best metric of poverty

00:24:04.240 --> 00:24:10.392
is something like
hopelessness, or maybe it's

00:24:10.392 --> 00:24:11.850
whether you have
books in the home,

00:24:11.850 --> 00:24:13.920
or whether you're ever
read to, whether there's

00:24:13.920 --> 00:24:17.000
any affection in the home
as you're growing up.

00:24:17.000 --> 00:24:20.210
And there are an awful
lot of kids growing up

00:24:20.210 --> 00:24:23.420
in America that,
by that measure,

00:24:23.420 --> 00:24:26.310
are as poor as any in the world.

00:24:26.310 --> 00:24:27.770
There are all kinds
of pathologies

00:24:27.770 --> 00:24:32.000
that come with poverty that
make it a lot harder to address

00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:33.950
than just a money issue.

00:24:33.950 --> 00:24:35.760
And it was
heartbreaking reporting

00:24:35.760 --> 00:24:36.760
on some of these things.

00:24:36.760 --> 00:24:38.680
There was one-- in
the opening clip

00:24:38.680 --> 00:24:41.640
you saw there was one little
boy, a four-year-old boy named

00:24:41.640 --> 00:24:42.220
Johnny.

00:24:42.220 --> 00:24:43.600
He can't speak.

00:24:43.600 --> 00:24:44.870
Why can't he speak?

00:24:44.870 --> 00:24:50.520
Because he had a hearing
problem early on in life,

00:24:50.520 --> 00:24:53.130
probably from untreated
ear infections.

00:24:53.130 --> 00:24:56.270
And so they weren't caught.

00:24:56.270 --> 00:24:59.150
He wouldn't get a
hearing screening.

00:24:59.150 --> 00:25:02.150
And so as his brain
is developing,

00:25:02.150 --> 00:25:05.310
he's not getting
any auditory input,

00:25:05.310 --> 00:25:07.660
so that he doesn't
develop speech.

00:25:07.660 --> 00:25:11.550
And finally, it's caught
later on by Save the Children.

00:25:11.550 --> 00:25:13.800
Thank God they were
there to do it.

00:25:13.800 --> 00:25:16.200
And we still don't know
whether he will ever fully

00:25:16.200 --> 00:25:17.640
be able to recover.

00:25:17.640 --> 00:25:21.610
An idea that this happens,
that a kid like Johnny

00:25:21.610 --> 00:25:23.860
can fall through the
cracks in this country,

00:25:23.860 --> 00:25:29.370
through something as simple as
missing a hearing screening,

00:25:29.370 --> 00:25:32.970
is just shattering when you
see a little kid like that.

00:25:32.970 --> 00:25:37.136
And I hope that one thing that
viewers will get from "A Path

00:25:37.136 --> 00:25:38.510
Appears" when they
see them is we

00:25:38.510 --> 00:25:40.922
have this narrative in this
country about how poverty

00:25:40.922 --> 00:25:42.380
is about personal
irresponsibility.

00:25:45.330 --> 00:25:48.046
There's no doubt that
that is sometimes true,

00:25:48.046 --> 00:25:49.920
that there are certainly
some poor people who

00:25:49.920 --> 00:25:53.140
are irresponsible, and there
is self-destructive behavior

00:25:53.140 --> 00:25:55.320
that sometimes
goes with poverty.

00:25:55.320 --> 00:25:57.310
But not always.

00:25:57.310 --> 00:26:01.520
And you get a four-year-old
kid who has done nothing wrong.

00:26:01.520 --> 00:26:05.110
And yet he is going to
be disadvantaged, perhaps

00:26:05.110 --> 00:26:08.360
for the rest of his life,
because we dropped the ball.

00:26:08.360 --> 00:26:10.439
We as a society dropped
the ball in providing

00:26:10.439 --> 00:26:11.230
hearing screenings.

00:26:11.230 --> 00:26:14.780
And that's an irresponsibility
that is not Johnny's.

00:26:14.780 --> 00:26:16.970
It's ours.

00:26:16.970 --> 00:26:18.780
CHERIE HANNOUCHE:
I think that story

00:26:18.780 --> 00:26:22.970
and obviously, Savannah's story,
as well, are so shattering.

00:26:22.970 --> 00:26:27.610
And they are so overwhelming
that a lot of times people

00:26:27.610 --> 00:26:28.750
wonder, what can I do?

00:26:28.750 --> 00:26:31.810
How can I actually
make a real difference?

00:26:31.810 --> 00:26:35.440
And you mentioned before, there
are many different levels where

00:26:35.440 --> 00:26:38.572
people can actually effectively
participate and join

00:26:38.572 --> 00:26:39.280
the conversation.

00:26:39.280 --> 00:26:42.050
What I love about the
documentary, but also the book,

00:26:42.050 --> 00:26:44.440
is that there are clear
stats that you have,

00:26:44.440 --> 00:26:47.490
which speak to what
people can actually do.

00:26:47.490 --> 00:26:51.180
One that I keep
with me every day

00:26:51.180 --> 00:26:54.370
is that if everyone just
gave up their morning coffee,

00:26:54.370 --> 00:26:58.160
$220 billion would go
back into these issues.

00:27:01.460 --> 00:27:03.520
I'd love to hear from
you guys, and I'm sure

00:27:03.520 --> 00:27:06.510
the audience, as well--
just other stats or things

00:27:06.510 --> 00:27:09.440
that are really eye-opening,
that can talk to certain change

00:27:09.440 --> 00:27:11.070
that we can make.

00:27:11.070 --> 00:27:15.600
MIRA CHANG: You should talk
to that, from in the book.

00:27:15.600 --> 00:27:20.010
NICHOLAS KRISTOF: You know, some
of the stats that really struck

00:27:20.010 --> 00:27:23.690
me are just about the
cost-effectiveness

00:27:23.690 --> 00:27:25.890
of addressing some
of these issues.

00:27:25.890 --> 00:27:28.704
We tend to think
that it's hopeless.

00:27:28.704 --> 00:27:30.620
And I think that's one
reason why we tune out.

00:27:30.620 --> 00:27:33.240
Maybe one problem of
us as journalists,

00:27:33.240 --> 00:27:34.870
and also the
humanitarian community ,

00:27:34.870 --> 00:27:37.360
is we focus so much on the
problems that we lead people

00:27:37.360 --> 00:27:39.627
to think that all
there are is problems.

00:27:39.627 --> 00:27:40.710
That there isn't progress.

00:27:40.710 --> 00:27:42.180
There has been
progress, and we do

00:27:42.180 --> 00:27:44.720
have some evidence-based
interventions that will work.

00:27:44.720 --> 00:27:47.280
And so one of the things we
emphasize, both in the book

00:27:47.280 --> 00:27:49.940
and in the
documentary, is what's

00:27:49.940 --> 00:27:52.360
called home visitation
programs, which basically

00:27:52.360 --> 00:27:56.630
work with at-risk
parents and at-risk kids

00:27:56.630 --> 00:27:58.820
very early in life,
beginning in pregnancy,

00:27:58.820 --> 00:28:01.660
up to the first
few years of life.

00:28:01.660 --> 00:28:04.690
And it's to encourage
pregnant women

00:28:04.690 --> 00:28:10.360
to try to avoid alcohol,
try to avoid drugs.

00:28:10.360 --> 00:28:15.010
After the birth, think about
if you want birth control, then

00:28:15.010 --> 00:28:18.010
here's how you might go about
getting it for a next child.

00:28:18.010 --> 00:28:19.130
Encourage breastfeeding.

00:28:19.130 --> 00:28:21.970
Encourage talking to a child.

00:28:21.970 --> 00:28:27.110
A child on welfare will
have heard 30 million

00:28:27.110 --> 00:28:31.720
fewer words by age four than
a child of professionals.

00:28:31.720 --> 00:28:33.540
30 million more words.

00:28:33.540 --> 00:28:37.750
And so they begin to
speak at the same time,

00:28:37.750 --> 00:28:41.840
but because of that gap
that child on welfare

00:28:41.840 --> 00:28:45.350
is going to be less
prepared for school.

00:28:45.350 --> 00:28:47.030
The verbal parts of
that child's brain

00:28:47.030 --> 00:28:48.321
are going to be less developed.

00:28:48.321 --> 00:28:49.590
It's a huge impediment.

00:28:49.590 --> 00:28:52.390
And so there are these
home visitation programs

00:28:52.390 --> 00:28:59.610
that coach these parents
on these elements

00:28:59.610 --> 00:29:01.940
of early childhood rearing.

00:29:01.940 --> 00:29:05.000
And the result is
that, even though they

00:29:05.000 --> 00:29:09.040
end at-- the one that was
studied most ends at age two.

00:29:09.040 --> 00:29:11.070
By age 15, those
kids are only half as

00:29:11.070 --> 00:29:13.360
likely to have been arrested.

00:29:13.360 --> 00:29:15.500
And because juvenile
incarceration

00:29:15.500 --> 00:29:20.230
is incredibly expensive,
$110,000 a year,

00:29:20.230 --> 00:29:23.190
this program, every
dollar invested in it

00:29:23.190 --> 00:29:25.760
pays for itself
seven times over.

00:29:25.760 --> 00:29:29.140
And so we would not only
be doing a huge benefit

00:29:29.140 --> 00:29:32.010
to these kids and
to these moms, we

00:29:32.010 --> 00:29:35.894
would be saving public
money on a major scale.

00:29:35.894 --> 00:29:37.310
And yet this
program-- it's called

00:29:37.310 --> 00:29:39.310
Nurse-Family Partnership--
it still only reaches

00:29:39.310 --> 00:29:42.470
that 2% of the kids
who need it in the US.

00:29:42.470 --> 00:29:47.190
And that's another example
where poverty is indeed,

00:29:47.190 --> 00:29:49.780
in some sense, about
personal responsibility.

00:29:49.780 --> 00:29:55.230
But that irresponsibility,
in part, is that of society

00:29:55.230 --> 00:30:00.175
and not actually implementing
evidence-based programs

00:30:00.175 --> 00:30:01.550
that would make
a real difference

00:30:01.550 --> 00:30:04.460
and would pay for themselves
multiple times over.

00:30:04.460 --> 00:30:05.960
MIRA CHANG: And
just to add on that,

00:30:05.960 --> 00:30:08.940
because I'm big on the early
intervention part, also--

00:30:08.940 --> 00:30:11.720
is that a lot of the
issues that we talk about,

00:30:11.720 --> 00:30:14.200
both in "Half the Sky"
and "A Path Appears"--

00:30:14.200 --> 00:30:17.980
sex trafficking, domestic
violence, teenage pregnancy--

00:30:17.980 --> 00:30:21.860
we tend to think about them
as very discreet issues.

00:30:21.860 --> 00:30:24.200
OK, let's just talk about
domestic violence right now.

00:30:24.200 --> 00:30:25.480
Let's just talk about this.

00:30:25.480 --> 00:30:27.650
But actually, if you
really think about

00:30:27.650 --> 00:30:30.790
where these women, and
men, and kids come from,

00:30:30.790 --> 00:30:34.020
and what their backgrounds are,
there are so many similarities.

00:30:34.020 --> 00:30:38.130
And a lot of them
have to do with what

00:30:38.130 --> 00:30:40.620
if you could intervene
a little earlier?

00:30:40.620 --> 00:30:43.220
What if you can remove
some of the vulnerability

00:30:43.220 --> 00:30:45.170
that they're facing
as a young child?

00:30:45.170 --> 00:30:48.380
What if the moms, when
they're having the babies,

00:30:48.380 --> 00:30:50.515
know how to raise their
babies, or give them

00:30:50.515 --> 00:30:53.460
a better shot at both
medical care or education?

00:30:53.460 --> 00:30:56.430
I think it has an impact on
all of these different things

00:30:56.430 --> 00:31:00.060
that we are talking about
and are worried about.

00:31:00.060 --> 00:31:03.650
So we should invest earlier.

00:31:03.650 --> 00:31:04.650
CHERIE HANNOUCHE: Great.

00:31:04.650 --> 00:31:07.191
Well, before-- I want to make
sure we have time to open it up

00:31:07.191 --> 00:31:11.410
to Q&amp;A-- before we do
that, I just wanted to ask,

00:31:11.410 --> 00:31:15.260
can you share with us what's
the secret to maintaining

00:31:15.260 --> 00:31:16.380
the optimism?

00:31:16.380 --> 00:31:21.470
And looking at any secrets
that-- when you read or watch

00:31:21.470 --> 00:31:25.040
the film, you can see that with
all of the different advocates.

00:31:25.040 --> 00:31:27.460
And you can see it even in
the trailer, as well-- some

00:31:27.460 --> 00:31:31.147
of those happy moments, as well.

00:31:31.147 --> 00:31:32.730
NICHOLAS KRISTOF:
People always think,

00:31:32.730 --> 00:31:37.030
because I spend a lot of time
covering genocide, and poverty,

00:31:37.030 --> 00:31:39.660
and sex trafficking,
that I must be

00:31:39.660 --> 00:31:45.360
kind of deeply depressed, and
greatly traumatized, and very

00:31:45.360 --> 00:31:45.860
fragile.

00:31:45.860 --> 00:31:49.890
And the truth is that, sure--
in reporting these things,

00:31:49.890 --> 00:31:52.380
you see some really
terrible things.

00:31:52.380 --> 00:31:54.497
But side by side with
the worst of humanity,

00:31:54.497 --> 00:31:55.830
you typically see the very best.

00:31:55.830 --> 00:31:59.550
You see incredible courage,
incredible resilience.

00:31:59.550 --> 00:32:01.510
You see people who are
making a difference

00:32:01.510 --> 00:32:04.030
and empowering people,
providing opportunity,

00:32:04.030 --> 00:32:07.470
and you also see an
element of progress.

00:32:07.470 --> 00:32:10.310
When I first-- and
I think this maybe

00:32:10.310 --> 00:32:12.110
is something that
we in journalism

00:32:12.110 --> 00:32:14.526
need to figure out better, how
to tell the story of-- when

00:32:14.526 --> 00:32:18.390
I first began traveling around
Africa as a backpacking law

00:32:18.390 --> 00:32:21.560
student, what really struck
me was the blindness.

00:32:21.560 --> 00:32:24.370
And there were so many
middle-aged people who,

00:32:24.370 --> 00:32:28.950
from river blindness, cataracts,
trachoma, could not see,

00:32:28.950 --> 00:32:32.050
could not work, could not
look after their kids.

00:32:32.050 --> 00:32:37.750
And for the book, we
talked to a woman in Mali

00:32:37.750 --> 00:32:41.150
who had had trachoma, which
is an incredibly painful way

00:32:41.150 --> 00:32:43.990
to go blind, for eight
years, had lost two kids

00:32:43.990 --> 00:32:46.230
because she couldn't
raise food for them.

00:32:46.230 --> 00:32:49.330
And then she got a $40
surgery through Helen Keller

00:32:49.330 --> 00:32:51.970
International, which is
right here in New York. $40

00:32:51.970 --> 00:32:56.680
surgery from a nurse,
20 minute operation.

00:32:56.680 --> 00:33:00.750
And then they're helping
her up off the table.

00:33:00.750 --> 00:33:02.560
And so, are you OK?

00:33:02.560 --> 00:33:04.560
Do you want us to walk
you back to your home?

00:33:04.560 --> 00:33:05.750
She says, get out of my way.

00:33:05.750 --> 00:33:06.760
I can see now.

00:33:06.760 --> 00:33:08.590
I can look after myself.

00:33:08.590 --> 00:33:10.900
$40-- I mean, that's
not depressing.

00:33:10.900 --> 00:33:14.920
That's inspiring,
what we can do.

00:33:14.920 --> 00:33:18.550
And on the whole,
that is happening.

00:33:18.550 --> 00:33:21.059
It's just not
happening fast enough.

00:33:21.059 --> 00:33:22.100
CHERIE HANNOUCHE: Thanks.

00:33:22.100 --> 00:33:22.800
Great.

00:33:22.800 --> 00:33:26.280
Let's open it up to the audience
to ask a couple questions.

00:33:26.280 --> 00:33:28.580
The mics are on both sides.

00:33:28.580 --> 00:33:30.890
AUDIENCE: Thank you guys,
both, for being here.

00:33:30.890 --> 00:33:32.580
Incredibly inspiring work.

00:33:32.580 --> 00:33:37.760
I watched the first installment
last Tuesday, streaming on PBS.

00:33:37.760 --> 00:33:39.400
I Chromecasted it to my TV.

00:33:39.400 --> 00:33:41.210
[LAUGHTER]

00:33:41.210 --> 00:33:42.820
AUDIENCE: So I
actually-- Nick, I

00:33:42.820 --> 00:33:43.720
come from "The New York Times."

00:33:43.720 --> 00:33:45.740
My background is on the business
side of "The New York Times,"

00:33:45.740 --> 00:33:47.574
and I've been at Google
for three years now.

00:33:47.574 --> 00:33:49.989
NICHOLAS KRISTOF: You've got
a better business model here.

00:33:49.989 --> 00:33:50.520
[LAUGHTER]

00:33:50.520 --> 00:33:52.610
AUDIENCE: Well, yeah-- a
developing business model

00:33:52.610 --> 00:33:53.984
at "The New York
Times," as well.

00:33:53.984 --> 00:33:57.590
But being at Google,
we know a lot

00:33:57.590 --> 00:34:00.170
about the laws of
supply and demand,

00:34:00.170 --> 00:34:02.000
understanding that
where the demand is,

00:34:02.000 --> 00:34:03.490
the supply will flow.

00:34:03.490 --> 00:34:05.070
You talk a lot about that.

00:34:05.070 --> 00:34:08.570
I'm excited to read this book
and look at it from a hopeful

00:34:08.570 --> 00:34:10.790
perspective of what we
can do across a myriad

00:34:10.790 --> 00:34:13.650
of different intervention
techniques, one of which

00:34:13.650 --> 00:34:16.290
is the early childhood
intervention.

00:34:16.290 --> 00:34:19.350
But what struck me as different
in the first installment

00:34:19.350 --> 00:34:21.040
was the focus on
the johns, right?

00:34:21.040 --> 00:34:23.870
This idea that if you
focus on the demand side,

00:34:23.870 --> 00:34:26.572
that that is the nice
way to kind of circumvent

00:34:26.572 --> 00:34:29.030
what you've been doing for
years and years and years, which

00:34:29.030 --> 00:34:32.670
hasn't worked clearly-- which
is focusing on the supply side.

00:34:32.670 --> 00:34:36.639
What did you see in your travels
and work around this book,

00:34:36.639 --> 00:34:39.340
and in the
documentary, that gives

00:34:39.340 --> 00:34:43.530
you hope that that is actually
a nice way to kind of buttress

00:34:43.530 --> 00:34:46.270
out the work that's been done
for years by law enforcement

00:34:46.270 --> 00:34:47.960
by focusing on the demand side?

00:34:47.960 --> 00:34:51.860
And are you hopeful that
that's an innovation that

00:34:51.860 --> 00:34:54.960
may be helpful in stemming
the tide of the trafficking

00:34:54.960 --> 00:34:56.594
trend in the US and abroad?

00:34:56.594 --> 00:34:58.260
NICHOLAS KRISTOF:
It's a great question.

00:34:58.260 --> 00:35:01.390
And indeed, I think that
focusing on the demand side

00:35:01.390 --> 00:35:03.860
is-- there's no
silver bullet here.

00:35:03.860 --> 00:35:05.300
But there's silver buckshot.

00:35:05.300 --> 00:35:07.471
And that's one of the
elements of silver buckshot

00:35:07.471 --> 00:35:09.220
that can make a
difference on trafficking.

00:35:09.220 --> 00:35:13.660
I'm generally a believer that
ending impunity for problems

00:35:13.660 --> 00:35:17.300
is hugely important.

00:35:17.300 --> 00:35:19.844
One of the things that
isn't much realized

00:35:19.844 --> 00:35:22.260
is that there has actually
been, over the last generation,

00:35:22.260 --> 00:35:27.010
huge progress in the US on both
domestic violence and rape,

00:35:27.010 --> 00:35:28.330
as best we can measure them.

00:35:28.330 --> 00:35:30.280
And the numbers are problematic.

00:35:30.280 --> 00:35:34.130
But using victimization surveys
it looks as if both of them

00:35:34.130 --> 00:35:37.250
have fallen by more than 50%
over the last generation.

00:35:37.250 --> 00:35:38.260
And why is that?

00:35:38.260 --> 00:35:41.050
A generation ago, there
was 100% impunity.

00:35:41.050 --> 00:35:42.920
A husband could completely
beat up his wife,

00:35:42.920 --> 00:35:44.510
a boyfriend completely
beat up his girlfriend.

00:35:44.510 --> 00:35:46.260
The police just
would not intervene.

00:35:46.260 --> 00:35:49.750
And most rapes are people
who know each other.

00:35:49.750 --> 00:35:53.069
It's a boyfriend/girlfriend
situation, or former boyfriend,

00:35:53.069 --> 00:35:53.860
whatever it may be.

00:35:53.860 --> 00:35:55.400
And again, there,
in that situation

00:35:55.400 --> 00:35:57.200
was almost complete impunity.

00:35:57.200 --> 00:35:59.610
Now we know that
there is still a lot

00:35:59.610 --> 00:36:01.800
of impunity in that situation.

00:36:01.800 --> 00:36:08.180
But now there are enough guys
who, even though they've drunk

00:36:08.180 --> 00:36:14.750
too much, they-- when this
girl says, no, stop here,

00:36:14.750 --> 00:36:16.530
something still goes
on in their brain.

00:36:16.530 --> 00:36:18.240
And they think there
might be a risk.

00:36:18.240 --> 00:36:22.240
And that's why those
victimization rates

00:36:22.240 --> 00:36:23.360
have gone down.

00:36:23.360 --> 00:36:26.780
In the case of
trafficking, again, we

00:36:26.780 --> 00:36:27.780
don't have good numbers.

00:36:27.780 --> 00:36:30.930
But a rough estimate
is about 300,000 men

00:36:30.930 --> 00:36:33.600
will buy sex today
somewhere in the US.

00:36:33.600 --> 00:36:36.970
Virtually none of
them will be arrested.

00:36:36.970 --> 00:36:39.000
You're more likely to
be hit by lightning

00:36:39.000 --> 00:36:41.350
than you are to be
arrested while buying sex.

00:36:41.350 --> 00:36:44.560
So there is essentially
no risk to you.

00:36:44.560 --> 00:36:47.970
A lot of those men
have a lot to lose

00:36:47.970 --> 00:36:52.210
if they were arrested
for buying sex.

00:36:52.210 --> 00:36:54.060
They have reputations.

00:36:54.060 --> 00:36:55.600
It would be a very bad thing.

00:36:55.600 --> 00:36:59.290
If there were just a 1% or 2%
risk that they might actually

00:36:59.290 --> 00:37:01.840
be arrested, I think
they wouldn't buy sex.

00:37:01.840 --> 00:37:04.560
And I think you
would, in that case,

00:37:04.560 --> 00:37:08.110
see a significant
drop in demand.

00:37:08.110 --> 00:37:12.580
And in that case, there would
be fewer women trafficked.

00:37:12.580 --> 00:37:16.390
And going after johns
is actually pretty easy.

00:37:16.390 --> 00:37:19.050
We have a segment in the
doc where we, essentially--

00:37:19.050 --> 00:37:21.700
the police department
posts an ad on Backpage

00:37:21.700 --> 00:37:24.420
and books a hotel room.

00:37:24.420 --> 00:37:27.630
And guys show up, and
show up, and show up,

00:37:27.630 --> 00:37:29.080
and you arrest
them as they come.

00:37:29.080 --> 00:37:34.510
And then it's
pretty basic stuff.

00:37:34.510 --> 00:37:37.490
And I think that wouldn't
solve the problem.

00:37:37.490 --> 00:37:39.357
But boy, I think it
would make a difference.

00:37:39.357 --> 00:37:40.940
MIRA CHANG: I just
want to add, also--

00:37:40.940 --> 00:37:43.310
so that was in Cook
County, Chicago.

00:37:43.310 --> 00:37:46.077
And they've done a lot
in terms of trafficking

00:37:46.077 --> 00:37:47.660
and also working
with survivor groups.

00:37:47.660 --> 00:37:49.980
And they just finished
another Johns Day.

00:37:49.980 --> 00:37:51.900
So there are numbers available.

00:37:51.900 --> 00:37:55.570
And I will also say it's
a lot about what we all

00:37:55.570 --> 00:37:58.190
think about johns
and whether or not

00:37:58.190 --> 00:38:00.410
we think prostitution
is OK or not.

00:38:00.410 --> 00:38:04.500
I've been to john schools
now, where people walk out,

00:38:04.500 --> 00:38:06.140
or the johns walk
out, and they just

00:38:06.140 --> 00:38:08.500
had no idea that A,
it was dangerous,

00:38:08.500 --> 00:38:12.830
or B, that's the backgrounds
of some of the women

00:38:12.830 --> 00:38:15.270
that they're engaging
in prostitution with.

00:38:15.270 --> 00:38:17.600
And I will say,
something that I love

00:38:17.600 --> 00:38:19.600
is there are certain
district attorney's offices

00:38:19.600 --> 00:38:22.930
that will post the pictures
of the johns it arrests,

00:38:22.930 --> 00:38:24.580
as it's public record.

00:38:24.580 --> 00:38:30.050
And it's part of that idea
that if you just-- you know,

00:38:30.050 --> 00:38:31.740
it's a shameful thing.

00:38:31.740 --> 00:38:36.960
So if we, as a society,
understand that idea,

00:38:36.960 --> 00:38:38.655
it'll make a dent.

00:38:44.729 --> 00:38:45.270
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:38:45.270 --> 00:38:46.276
Thank you for coming in.

00:38:46.276 --> 00:38:47.775
You talked about
early intervention.

00:38:47.775 --> 00:38:49.240
And I was just
wondering if you had

00:38:49.240 --> 00:38:52.800
any comments about parental
leave in this country,

00:38:52.800 --> 00:38:55.120
as comparison with
other places, and how

00:38:55.120 --> 00:38:58.395
that might have an effect
on early intervention.

00:39:01.970 --> 00:39:03.470
NICHOLAS KRISTOF:
You know, we don't

00:39:03.470 --> 00:39:05.500
have good research on that.

00:39:05.500 --> 00:39:10.144
It makes sense that
parental leave would help.

00:39:10.144 --> 00:39:12.060
Maternal attachment--
there was one study that

00:39:12.060 --> 00:39:16.400
found that maternal attachment
at 18 months to a child

00:39:16.400 --> 00:39:20.290
was a better predictor of high
school graduation than IQ was.

00:39:20.290 --> 00:39:23.965
So there's pretty good evidence
that there is a correlation.

00:39:23.965 --> 00:39:29.070
It would make sense that
a mom or a dad to who

00:39:29.070 --> 00:39:30.817
is going to be
around is going to be

00:39:30.817 --> 00:39:32.650
more likely to have
that kind of attachment.

00:39:32.650 --> 00:39:34.900
But we don't have,
to my knowledge,

00:39:34.900 --> 00:39:36.850
rigorous evidence on that.

00:39:36.850 --> 00:39:40.430
What we do know is that
access to parental leave

00:39:40.430 --> 00:39:48.640
seems to leave working class
moms more likely to stay

00:39:48.640 --> 00:39:54.010
in the labor force, which is a
good way of fighting poverty.

00:39:54.010 --> 00:39:58.590
I mean, a job-- I don't quote
President Reagan very much,

00:39:58.590 --> 00:40:01.670
but one thing he was right on
is that the best social program

00:40:01.670 --> 00:40:02.650
is a job.

00:40:02.650 --> 00:40:06.950
And I think there's
been a misperception

00:40:06.950 --> 00:40:12.490
that things like parental
leave will reduce employment.

00:40:12.490 --> 00:40:15.890
And in fact, the best evidence
from Europe, for example,

00:40:15.890 --> 00:40:19.560
is they actually boost
employment and likewise things

00:40:19.560 --> 00:40:22.370
like paid sick leave, this kind
of thing, that they actually

00:40:22.370 --> 00:40:24.820
boost employment by
making employment

00:40:24.820 --> 00:40:28.120
more compatible with parenthood,
and especially single

00:40:28.120 --> 00:40:28.620
parenthood.

00:40:31.439 --> 00:40:31.980
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:40:31.980 --> 00:40:32.850
My name's Carlie.

00:40:32.850 --> 00:40:35.380
I haven't read the book, but
I didn't read "Half the Sky"

00:40:35.380 --> 00:40:38.880
and I found it incredibly
inspiring years ago.

00:40:38.880 --> 00:40:41.990
My question is about, when
you say early intervention,

00:40:41.990 --> 00:40:43.410
how does-- I don't
know if there's

00:40:43.410 --> 00:40:45.600
any research on the
foster care system,

00:40:45.600 --> 00:40:47.550
specifically in New York City.

00:40:47.550 --> 00:40:49.830
Do you find that a lot of
children who get caught up

00:40:49.830 --> 00:40:54.290
in the trafficking are runaways,
or perhaps in foster care

00:40:54.290 --> 00:40:55.810
that is inadequate?

00:40:55.810 --> 00:40:59.477
Just curious how that plays
a role in the equation.

00:40:59.477 --> 00:41:00.560
MIRA CHANG: Oh, it's huge.

00:41:00.560 --> 00:41:01.390
Absolutely.

00:41:01.390 --> 00:41:05.310
I mean, a lot of the
organizations that we feature

00:41:05.310 --> 00:41:12.070
in the series deal specifically
with foster care kids,

00:41:12.070 --> 00:41:15.330
or throwaways, or runaways,
because those are definitely

00:41:15.330 --> 00:41:17.530
the most vulnerable demographic.

00:41:17.530 --> 00:41:20.360
Because they don't have the
guidance, or the mentorship,

00:41:20.360 --> 00:41:23.880
or the confidence,
really, to be able to know

00:41:23.880 --> 00:41:28.280
what to do in a situation when
they're approached by someone.

00:41:28.280 --> 00:41:30.300
Runaways, in particular.

00:41:30.300 --> 00:41:33.010
If you're on the street,
you don't have any money,

00:41:33.010 --> 00:41:34.640
you don't have any
place to go to,

00:41:34.640 --> 00:41:38.590
and it is a dangerous,
dangerous world out there.

00:41:38.590 --> 00:41:40.140
Because there are
a lot of people

00:41:40.140 --> 00:41:44.380
that know how easy it
is to sell other people.

00:41:44.380 --> 00:41:47.089
Do you want to say
anything about it?

00:41:47.089 --> 00:41:48.630
NICHOLAS KRISTOF:
One of the programs

00:41:48.630 --> 00:41:54.360
that has a really good
record-- and again, it's

00:41:54.360 --> 00:41:56.110
been done with randomized
control trials,

00:41:56.110 --> 00:41:57.900
really a kind of
evidence-based attempt--

00:41:57.900 --> 00:41:59.230
is called Youth Villages.

00:41:59.230 --> 00:42:05.380
And what it does is, because
often, foster parent success

00:42:05.380 --> 00:42:07.530
rates aren't great, and
institutional rates aren't

00:42:07.530 --> 00:42:11.310
great, that what they
do is try to provide

00:42:11.310 --> 00:42:15.780
strong support to
that child's family.

00:42:15.780 --> 00:42:19.380
Or if the mom and dad aren't
appropriate, or in jail,

00:42:19.380 --> 00:42:22.160
or whatever, then to find
some other relative who

00:42:22.160 --> 00:42:24.599
may be willing to
take that child in.

00:42:24.599 --> 00:42:26.640
So that it's at least part
of the extended family

00:42:26.640 --> 00:42:30.350
and then provide them
support and coaching

00:42:30.350 --> 00:42:31.530
to make it more feasible.

00:42:31.530 --> 00:42:36.050
And that has worked much better.

00:42:36.050 --> 00:42:40.700
There does seem to be this
yearning for family ties.

00:42:40.700 --> 00:42:46.250
And it's now being introduced
by more and more states

00:42:46.250 --> 00:42:47.650
because it saves money, again.

00:42:47.650 --> 00:42:49.316
Because then they're
spending less money

00:42:49.316 --> 00:42:51.250
on these juvenile
detention centers,

00:42:51.250 --> 00:42:53.690
which are incredibly expensive.

00:42:53.690 --> 00:42:58.550
And the outcomes are also
better for these kind

00:42:58.550 --> 00:43:00.450
of extended
family-based programs.

00:43:04.409 --> 00:43:04.950
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:43:04.950 --> 00:43:06.220
My name's Bianca Levy.

00:43:06.220 --> 00:43:09.050
I'm a fan of yours
and Charles's work.

00:43:09.050 --> 00:43:10.970
My question's about
the Super Bowl.

00:43:10.970 --> 00:43:13.140
It's one of the most
dangerous times of year,

00:43:13.140 --> 00:43:16.180
in terms of sex
trafficking, yet there

00:43:16.180 --> 00:43:18.160
seems to be very little
awareness about it.

00:43:18.160 --> 00:43:21.450
So what do we know about human
trafficking around the Super

00:43:21.450 --> 00:43:24.620
Bowl, and what preventative
measures are being done,

00:43:24.620 --> 00:43:29.570
or do you think should
be done, to prevent this?

00:43:29.570 --> 00:43:32.110
There's actually something
of a debate about this.

00:43:32.110 --> 00:43:35.860
And the conventional
wisdom has been

00:43:35.860 --> 00:43:38.780
that there's a lot
of trafficking,

00:43:38.780 --> 00:43:43.240
that Super Bowl tends to
be a hub for trafficking.

00:43:43.240 --> 00:43:45.010
And it makes intuitive
sense, but there

00:43:45.010 --> 00:43:49.450
have been some studies of
trying to look at ads for sex

00:43:49.450 --> 00:43:54.160
on Backpage.com in cities where
the Super Bowl is being held.

00:43:54.160 --> 00:44:00.260
And I think I've come across
three different studies

00:44:00.260 --> 00:44:03.910
of this, and they come to
somewhat mixed results.

00:44:03.910 --> 00:44:07.820
But they don't seem to suggest
that it is nearly as much

00:44:07.820 --> 00:44:15.800
of a hub for trafficking as
the conventional wisdom is.

00:44:15.800 --> 00:44:18.320
And I don't know enough
about the underlying reasons

00:44:18.320 --> 00:44:19.410
for that.

00:44:19.410 --> 00:44:23.590
It is true that, generally,
convention cities

00:44:23.590 --> 00:44:28.410
tend to be a time
when people go online

00:44:28.410 --> 00:44:33.950
and buy-- 10% of American men
in one survey had purchased sex

00:44:33.950 --> 00:44:35.530
online in the previous year.

00:44:35.530 --> 00:44:38.530
It's a huge thing.

00:44:38.530 --> 00:44:41.007
But that connection with the
Super Bowl, at least to me,

00:44:41.007 --> 00:44:41.840
is somewhat elusive.

00:44:46.587 --> 00:44:47.800
AUDIENCE: Hi there.

00:44:47.800 --> 00:44:48.950
Thanks for being here.

00:44:48.950 --> 00:44:50.140
My name's Eleanor.

00:44:50.140 --> 00:44:53.030
And as an avid "Law
and Order" fan,

00:44:53.030 --> 00:44:59.610
I'm curious about how we can use
and leverage popularized media.

00:44:59.610 --> 00:45:02.470
Be it like movies
or a television

00:45:02.470 --> 00:45:07.140
and to educate
America and elsewhere

00:45:07.140 --> 00:45:09.740
about these very pressing
issues around domestic violence,

00:45:09.740 --> 00:45:12.222
around sex
trafficking, and rape.

00:45:12.222 --> 00:45:14.430
And I'm curious if you've
done work with that before,

00:45:14.430 --> 00:45:17.920
or what your thoughts are on
leveraging and media as a way

00:45:17.920 --> 00:45:21.220
to shift the mindset, where
maybe law and policy might

00:45:21.220 --> 00:45:23.529
be slower to do so.

00:45:23.529 --> 00:45:25.070
NICHOLAS KRISTOF:
I'm a huge believer

00:45:25.070 --> 00:45:26.640
in exactly what you're saying.

00:45:26.640 --> 00:45:28.680
And I come to this
reluctantly, because I

00:45:28.680 --> 00:45:33.050
have-- a scribbler is a
kind of disdain for TV,

00:45:33.050 --> 00:45:33.950
oh, we're above that.

00:45:33.950 --> 00:45:40.885
And yet-- and then I came
across a pretty amazing pair

00:45:40.885 --> 00:45:43.557
of studies, one in
Brazil and one in India.

00:45:43.557 --> 00:45:45.890
And I've always really believed
that girls' education is

00:45:45.890 --> 00:45:48.390
the way you really
transform a society.

00:45:48.390 --> 00:45:52.990
That is the incredible
elixir of changing minds.

00:45:52.990 --> 00:45:54.930
And then there was
one study in India

00:45:54.930 --> 00:45:58.590
that looked at what happens
when television arrives

00:45:58.590 --> 00:46:00.280
in a rural village
for the first time,

00:46:00.280 --> 00:46:02.390
and change in attitudes
in that village.

00:46:02.390 --> 00:46:06.760
And it found that six months
of television in a village

00:46:06.760 --> 00:46:10.390
is equivalent to-- I forget--
four years of education,

00:46:10.390 --> 00:46:12.470
or something, in
terms of attitudes.

00:46:12.470 --> 00:46:14.345
Towards domestic violence.

00:46:14.345 --> 00:46:15.720
Towards whether
a woman should be

00:46:15.720 --> 00:46:17.610
able to leave the house
without her husband.

00:46:17.610 --> 00:46:18.401
This kind of thing.

00:46:18.401 --> 00:46:22.780
And it seemed to be that people
had very traditional attitudes

00:46:22.780 --> 00:46:23.970
in these villages.

00:46:23.970 --> 00:46:28.660
And then these TV shows
essentially showed middle class

00:46:28.660 --> 00:46:31.820
urban families, where
the woman was educated,

00:46:31.820 --> 00:46:33.590
where she was not
getting beaten up,

00:46:33.590 --> 00:46:34.990
where she was leaving the house.

00:46:34.990 --> 00:46:39.220
And that because it was kind
of high status families,

00:46:39.220 --> 00:46:41.740
that tended to-- villagers
kind of respected it.

00:46:41.740 --> 00:46:44.430
And something similar in Brazil.

00:46:44.430 --> 00:46:46.967
And then here, in
this country, one

00:46:46.967 --> 00:46:48.800
of the things that has
particularly vexed me

00:46:48.800 --> 00:46:50.280
is the problem of
teen pregnancy--

00:46:50.280 --> 00:46:52.090
that 30% of American
teenage girls

00:46:52.090 --> 00:46:53.930
become pregnant by age 19.

00:46:53.930 --> 00:46:54.880
30%.

00:46:54.880 --> 00:47:02.360
And that is down now 51%,
since the modern peak in 1991.

00:47:02.360 --> 00:47:06.610
Well, what brought it down
from that modern peak?

00:47:06.610 --> 00:47:11.430
One of the factors was "16
and Pregnant," the TV show,

00:47:11.430 --> 00:47:16.090
by essentially showing teenage
girls this is what pregnancy

00:47:16.090 --> 00:47:18.590
and being a mom is like.

00:47:18.590 --> 00:47:20.090
I can't say that I
watched the show,

00:47:20.090 --> 00:47:25.110
but I gather that
was the takeaway.

00:47:25.110 --> 00:47:32.590
And so I love my perch on the
Op Ed page of "The New York

00:47:32.590 --> 00:47:34.660
Times," but I do think
that people come up

00:47:34.660 --> 00:47:38.990
with plot lines on
some of these shows

00:47:38.990 --> 00:47:42.720
in ways that aren't didactic,
and aren't heavy-handed,

00:47:42.720 --> 00:47:46.800
but maybe it can send a message.

00:47:46.800 --> 00:47:49.280
And Neal Baer has done
this incredibly well

00:47:49.280 --> 00:47:53.530
with some of his TV shows.

00:47:53.530 --> 00:47:55.680
I think that may be
a really powerful way

00:47:55.680 --> 00:47:58.740
to open minds and hearts.

00:47:58.740 --> 00:48:00.140
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:48:00.140 --> 00:48:02.841
CHERIE HANNOUCHE: We've got
time for one more question.

00:48:02.841 --> 00:48:05.090
AUDIENCE: So you said at the
beginning of the trailer,

00:48:05.090 --> 00:48:07.620
how poverty is at the
root of all of this.

00:48:07.620 --> 00:48:09.970
I Can you explain more about
how poverty plays a role?

00:48:13.010 --> 00:48:14.800
MIRA CHANG: I can
start with the idea

00:48:14.800 --> 00:48:17.955
that one thing that we
kept trying to unveil,

00:48:17.955 --> 00:48:20.930
this idea that
poverty is not just

00:48:20.930 --> 00:48:24.610
a financial or
dollar kind of idea.

00:48:24.610 --> 00:48:29.360
It's really a vicious cycle
that is difficult to get out of,

00:48:29.360 --> 00:48:34.220
whether you're in Colombia
or you're in West Virginia.

00:48:34.220 --> 00:48:36.699
And so as we-- you've
known this for a long time,

00:48:36.699 --> 00:48:37.990
you've been telling me stories.

00:48:37.990 --> 00:48:40.240
But as we were filming
and actually collecting

00:48:40.240 --> 00:48:46.140
these stories, you just heard
the same patterns over and over

00:48:46.140 --> 00:48:46.860
again.

00:48:46.860 --> 00:48:48.720
Whether our story
was trafficking

00:48:48.720 --> 00:48:53.590
or whether our story
was domestic violence,

00:48:53.590 --> 00:48:56.800
there were similarities
in terms of how

00:48:56.800 --> 00:48:59.490
poverty and the
lack of opportunity

00:48:59.490 --> 00:49:01.890
contributed to that kind
of vulnerability that

00:49:01.890 --> 00:49:06.382
led to certain abuses.

00:49:06.382 --> 00:49:07.340
NICHOLAS KRISTOF: Yeah.

00:49:07.340 --> 00:49:12.260
In Tulsa, Oklahoma,
we met a family.

00:49:12.260 --> 00:49:15.300
The girl-- it was a small girl.

00:49:15.300 --> 00:49:18.245
Her mom was 13 when she had her.

00:49:20.890 --> 00:49:25.610
Her mom, the grandmother,
was 14 when she had her.

00:49:25.610 --> 00:49:28.410
The great-grandmother was
13 when she'd had her.

00:49:28.410 --> 00:49:35.780
You had this cycle and when
you have babies having babies,

00:49:35.780 --> 00:49:40.340
then that's not good for either
the mom or for the child.

00:49:40.340 --> 00:49:45.885
It's more likely to lead to
a lack of maternal attachment

00:49:45.885 --> 00:49:49.840
in childhood to
the child hearing

00:49:49.840 --> 00:49:54.280
fewer of these words being
spoken, less talking--

00:49:54.280 --> 00:49:56.010
MIRA CHANG: Nutrition--

00:49:56.010 --> 00:49:58.340
NICHOLAS KRISTOF: To
the nutrition issues,

00:49:58.340 --> 00:50:01.970
to sometimes self-medication.

00:50:01.970 --> 00:50:05.110
In West Virginia,
20% of kids now

00:50:05.110 --> 00:50:08.160
are born with alcohol or
narcotics in their system.

00:50:08.160 --> 00:50:10.070
20%.

00:50:10.070 --> 00:50:16.880
And those kids, they're
not at the starting line.

00:50:16.880 --> 00:50:24.180
And so then people, partly
because they self-medicate,

00:50:24.180 --> 00:50:27.380
they get an arrest.

00:50:27.380 --> 00:50:30.340
And then once you have
a criminal record,

00:50:30.340 --> 00:50:32.970
you become even less employable.

00:50:32.970 --> 00:50:37.340
You get then-- one thing the
conservatives were essentially

00:50:37.340 --> 00:50:39.180
right about and
liberals wrong about,

00:50:39.180 --> 00:50:41.200
over the last
generation or two, was

00:50:41.200 --> 00:50:43.990
the importance of
families for raising kids.

00:50:43.990 --> 00:50:46.950
And there's evidence that
boys, in particular-- it really

00:50:46.950 --> 00:50:49.160
matters if a dad is at home.

00:50:49.160 --> 00:50:52.660
And I think conservatives
were right on that.

00:50:52.660 --> 00:50:55.360
They were absolutely wrong
about mass incarceration.

00:50:55.360 --> 00:50:57.180
Mass incarceration--
by quintupling

00:50:57.180 --> 00:51:00.010
the number of
people behind bars,

00:51:00.010 --> 00:51:04.096
we dramatically reduce the
number of dads at home.

00:51:04.096 --> 00:51:11.610
And so you have all
these issues swirling

00:51:11.610 --> 00:51:18.360
around that make it a lot
harder for these kids.

00:51:18.360 --> 00:51:23.030
And it's not exactly poverty
in the sense of low income,

00:51:23.030 --> 00:51:25.800
but poverty in its
broader sense of just not

00:51:25.800 --> 00:51:28.510
seeing a trajectory out.

00:51:28.510 --> 00:51:34.300
Not getting the support,
not having that access

00:51:34.300 --> 00:51:39.380
to economic and social mobility
and access to education

00:51:39.380 --> 00:51:43.780
that is the best
escalator out of poverty.

00:51:43.780 --> 00:51:46.260
CHERIE HANNOUCHE: I know
that whole the focus on that

00:51:46.260 --> 00:51:48.700
is also something that
will be airing tonight,

00:51:48.700 --> 00:51:50.700
and a big part of
tonight's episode.

00:51:50.700 --> 00:51:53.700
So I encourage everybody
to watch tonight,

00:51:53.700 --> 00:51:57.430
and also next Monday,
at 10 PM on PBS.

00:51:57.430 --> 00:51:59.010
Thank you so much,
Nicholas and Mira.

00:51:59.010 --> 00:52:02.430
There are books that
Nicholas signed in the back,

00:52:02.430 --> 00:52:04.280
as well, if you're interested.

00:52:04.280 --> 00:52:06.530
But thank you so much
for joining us today.

00:52:06.530 --> 00:52:07.780
NICHOLAS KRISTOF: Thanks a lot

00:52:07.780 --> 00:52:08.430
MIRA CHANG: Thanks
for having us.

00:52:08.430 --> 00:52:09.330
Appreciate it.

00:52:09.330 --> 00:52:12.080
