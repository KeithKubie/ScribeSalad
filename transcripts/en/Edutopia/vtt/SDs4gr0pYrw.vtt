00:00:03.346 --> 00:00:05.816
&gt;&gt;Mary Jean: Ontario is an
incredibly diverse province.

00:00:06.316 --> 00:00:09.396
And so if our goal is going to be
to improve student achievement,

00:00:09.396 --> 00:00:12.706
so our children will grow into
successful and happy adults,

00:00:13.156 --> 00:00:14.686
we need to deal with that diversity.

00:00:15.256 --> 00:00:17.466
And so it's not seen as a barrier,

00:00:17.626 --> 00:00:34.386
it's seen as an opportunity
and a challenge.

00:00:40.006 --> 00:00:43.636
&gt;&gt;Avis: From the outset,
we agreed that we had

00:00:43.696 --> 00:00:46.626
to have special interventions
in place

00:00:47.046 --> 00:00:49.496
in order to bring the bottom up.

00:00:49.746 --> 00:00:52.946
The students who traditionally
had not done well.

00:01:25.516 --> 00:01:28.056
&gt;&gt;Pat: So are you going
to join our sports teams?

00:01:28.056 --> 00:01:28.476
&gt;&gt;Student: Yeah, I will.

00:01:28.986 --> 00:01:30.576
&gt;&gt;Pat: And what's your
favorite sport?

00:01:31.026 --> 00:01:32.186
&gt;&gt;Student: Track and field.

00:01:32.186 --> 00:01:34.436
&gt;&gt;Pat: Oh, track and field; Oh, yeah,
we have a great track and field.

00:01:34.476 --> 00:01:36.326
But that's not till this spring,

00:01:36.326 --> 00:01:37.876
are you going to play
something in-between?

00:01:38.296 --> 00:01:39.956
&gt;&gt;Susan: A lot of the
students that do come new

00:01:39.956 --> 00:01:44.466
to the country have a variety of
needs and that may be academic,

00:01:44.536 --> 00:01:47.926
it may be social, it
may be language-based.

00:01:47.926 --> 00:01:51.576
it may be family-based, it
could be just survival skills.

00:01:51.606 --> 00:01:53.036
You know, "How do I get transit?

00:01:53.036 --> 00:01:54.686
Where is extra help available?"

00:01:54.966 --> 00:01:58.766
And a student's success person
is a critical piece in a school

00:01:58.916 --> 00:02:00.976
to help support that child.

00:02:01.126 --> 00:02:02.306
&gt;&gt;Pat: Okay, how far did you get?

00:02:02.306 --> 00:02:03.606
Did you get to the end of the book.

00:02:04.386 --> 00:02:04.566
&gt;&gt;Student: Almost.

00:02:05.326 --> 00:02:07.386
&gt;&gt;Pat: Okay, what's happened
since I read with you?

00:02:07.656 --> 00:02:10.826
&gt;&gt;Pat: Students that are new to
Canada, there's a large transition.

00:02:11.086 --> 00:02:13.056
The expectation is
that they read quickly.

00:02:13.996 --> 00:02:18.366
That they process in English, and
that they can make inferences.

00:02:19.006 --> 00:02:21.516
And those are skills
they may not have learned

00:02:21.516 --> 00:02:23.046
in their own schooling system.

00:02:23.626 --> 00:02:27.116
So we work with students
to bridge that gap.

00:02:27.636 --> 00:02:30.826
&gt;&gt;Pat: Semester 1,
he has Period 1 off.

00:02:31.096 --> 00:02:33.086
he has art Period 2.

00:02:33.086 --> 00:02:35.126
He is good at strings.

00:02:35.126 --> 00:02:37.376
His music mark is good.

00:02:37.376 --> 00:02:39.616
So he will also get a
credit after school.

00:02:39.736 --> 00:02:42.166
&gt;&gt;Pat: We have weekly meetings.

00:02:42.166 --> 00:02:45.526
It brings our team
together, and it allow us

00:02:45.526 --> 00:02:49.416
to track the students
that we are watching.

00:02:49.796 --> 00:02:52.076
&gt;&gt;Teacher: Would a
support for him be--

00:02:52.076 --> 00:02:55.736
there's going to be a new drama
class created, and it's going

00:02:55.736 --> 00:02:57.836
to be a nine/ten split drama.

00:02:57.836 --> 00:03:01.246
That might be a good place for
him to acquire some language.

00:03:01.416 --> 00:03:04.146
&gt;&gt;Susan: Generally, the entire
school staff needs to be involved.

00:03:04.146 --> 00:03:05.606
This is a collaborative effort.

00:03:05.606 --> 00:03:10.326
Although, one person has the time
dedicated towards making sure it all

00:03:10.326 --> 00:03:13.216
comes together, really it
is a full-school initiative.

00:03:13.706 --> 00:03:18.076
&gt;&gt;Pat: We've been working in Success
with Janice since she was in Grade 9.

00:03:18.076 --> 00:03:19.196
She came on her own.

00:03:19.876 --> 00:03:21.216
She came from Hong Kong.

00:03:21.726 --> 00:03:23.306
&gt;&gt;Susan: Some students
come across the table,

00:03:23.526 --> 00:03:25.436
they're failing all four subjects.

00:03:25.716 --> 00:03:28.426
They don't have money
for a transit pass.

00:03:28.426 --> 00:03:30.566
They're living with no
parents in the country.

00:03:30.566 --> 00:03:32.326
Their parents might
be living in China.

00:03:32.786 --> 00:03:36.446
&gt;&gt;Pat: Last year, Dave and
I worked with the family

00:03:36.516 --> 00:03:39.606
to move the guardianship
to another family.

00:03:40.866 --> 00:03:43.446
She wasn't progressing
well without family.

00:03:43.446 --> 00:03:45.846
She was not even allowed to
stay after school to see me.

00:03:46.466 --> 00:03:47.076
Mm hm.

00:03:47.076 --> 00:03:49.176
&gt;&gt;Susan: And that team
will network everything

00:03:49.176 --> 00:03:53.346
from the cultural settlement
worker to the administrator to say,

00:03:53.566 --> 00:03:56.886
an Alt. Ed. teacher,
to make connections and set

00:03:56.886 --> 00:03:58.326
up that program for success.

00:03:58.536 --> 00:04:02.466
That's the best example of a student
success team is looking at the child,

00:04:02.586 --> 00:04:05.606
and looking holistically
how we can support them.

00:04:05.606 --> 00:04:09.266
&gt;&gt;Pat: It's funny they say,
"I actually felt awake."

00:04:11.046 --> 00:04:13.916
So maybe she-- this was
something new to me?

00:04:13.916 --> 00:04:16.786
Mornings look a lot better
after nine hours of sleep.

00:04:17.326 --> 00:04:19.396
&gt;&gt;Pat: The one-on-one
that's needed for some kids

00:04:19.396 --> 00:04:23.136
to be successful can't be done when
you have another job happening.

00:04:23.766 --> 00:04:28.036
You can't sit and take the
time to read with a student.

00:04:28.496 --> 00:04:30.126
And they really need that extra time.

00:04:31.156 --> 00:04:35.876
We don't want to be seen
as a disciplinarian.

00:04:36.566 --> 00:04:39.996
When I introduce myself to the
new staff this year, I said,

00:04:39.996 --> 00:04:41.156
"Don't use me as a threat."

00:04:42.586 --> 00:04:45.596
Even my room, it doesn't
look like a classroom.

00:04:46.256 --> 00:04:47.726
I didn't put desks in it.

00:04:48.486 --> 00:04:49.656
I didn't want desks.

00:04:49.996 --> 00:04:52.676
If it's an uncomfortable environment,
they're not going to come

00:04:52.736 --> 00:04:56.316
after school for help or on their
lunch hour if it's more school.

00:04:56.626 --> 00:05:00.576
So they may sit in a chair and read
their book that they're behind in,

00:05:00.826 --> 00:05:02.686
because they get to sit
in a comfortable chair.

00:05:08.036 --> 00:05:09.036
&gt;&gt;Mary Jean: We're succeeding!

00:05:09.286 --> 00:05:11.636
In the five or six years that
we've been working at this,

00:05:12.156 --> 00:05:14.706
the performance gap for our
new English-language learners

00:05:14.706 --> 00:05:18.626
in this province has been closed
by about half of that gap.

00:05:18.956 --> 00:05:22.726
And that's absolutely critical in
a province where up to 40 percent

00:05:22.726 --> 00:05:26.906
of our children are, in fact, coming
from places outside of our province.
