00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:02.310
- [Interviewer] What kind of
levers does the Speaker have

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:05.090
in relation to the other
House representatives?

00:00:05.090 --> 00:00:07.270
- The Speaker has all kinds of levers,

00:00:07.270 --> 00:00:10.090
both formal and informal.

00:00:10.090 --> 00:00:11.760
In fact, a lot of them are informal.

00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:14.255
So, the Speaker can, Speaker
names a lot of people

00:00:14.255 --> 00:00:18.070
to the committees,
particularly to the, quote,

00:00:18.070 --> 00:00:19.590
the Rules Committee in the House.

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:20.830
And what does the Rules Committee do?

00:00:20.830 --> 00:00:23.300
The Rules Committee sets
the rules for what's debated

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:24.980
and what comes onto the floor.

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:27.620
And so, through controlling
the Rules Committee,

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:30.550
you can control what kinds
of amendments come up,

00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:34.070
how much debate there
is for unpopular ideas,

00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:37.740
and you can help get legislation through

00:00:37.740 --> 00:00:40.520
by managing the rules
under which it's debated.

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:43.110
There's a famous instance
in which Dennis Hastert,

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:45.880
who was Speaker of the
House under George W. Bush,

00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:48.620
held open a vote on Medicare Part D.

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:51.820
This was adding prescription
drugs to the Medicare Plan.

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:53.850
And what holding open
a vote means is you set

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:56.220
a certain time for the
number of votes that come in.

00:00:56.220 --> 00:00:58.120
And at the end of that
time, you count the votes,

00:00:58.120 --> 00:00:59.410
are they in, does it pass.

00:00:59.410 --> 00:01:00.920
Well, it wasn't passing.

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:04.760
And so, Hastert let the vote
stay open while he went around

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:08.580
and strong-armed individual
members of the Republican side,

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:11.050
he was a Republican
Speaker, strong-armed them,

00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:12.550
said, "You really gotta vote for this,"

00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:14.120
and finally got enough votes,

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:16.170
and just when it went over the threshold,

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:17.190
boom, he closed the window,

00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:19.660
said, "The vote's over," and it passed.

00:01:19.660 --> 00:01:21.580
And what did he do to
get those extra votes?

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:24.290
Well, you can give people
plum committee assignments,

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:26.570
you can help their
legislation get to the floor

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:29.000
that maybe wasn't getting
there fast enough.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.710
And the other powers you have
is you can go raise money

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:35.140
for them or get the people
you know on the political side

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:37.870
to make their run for reelection easier.

00:01:37.870 --> 00:01:40.480
So, there are lot of gifts
you can give to your members

00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:42.630
or things you can withhold from them

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:44.130
to make them do what you want.
