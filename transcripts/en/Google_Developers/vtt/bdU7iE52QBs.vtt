00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:06.080
Store locators are among the
most popular applications built

00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:07.982
today using Google Maps API.

00:00:07.982 --> 00:00:10.190
Whether you're building a
site to help customers find

00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:12.440
the nearest store
or book a hotel,

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:15.670
your application needs a place
to store and query location

00:00:15.670 --> 00:00:16.550
data.

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:18.700
That's where a Google
Cloud Platform can help.

00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:21.450
By building your application
using Google Cloud's SQL

00:00:21.450 --> 00:00:23.560
and App Engine, you
can scale your maps

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:24.910
to millions of customers.

00:00:24.910 --> 00:00:28.000
No need to buy and maintain your
own infrastructure, hardware,

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:28.970
or software.

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:31.330
For developers looking to
migrate their store locators

00:00:31.330 --> 00:00:34.090
to Google's cloud, we've created
a helpful guide that shows you

00:00:34.090 --> 00:00:38.060
how to, one, create a cloud
SQL database table, two,

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:40.720
perform geospatial
queries, and three,

00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:44.560
visualize the data using
GeoJSON and our APIs.

00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:46.890
We also have a sample
code library in Python

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:48.870
to help you quickly get started.

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:52.360
