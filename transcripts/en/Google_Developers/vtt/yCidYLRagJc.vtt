RICHARD HYNDMAN: Next up
we have Mr. Dan Galpin,

00:00:03.430 --> 00:00:06.180
developer advocate on
the games team here.

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:08.560
He's the very model of
a modern multi-tasker.

00:00:08.560 --> 00:00:10.392
And with that he's
going to teach you

00:00:10.392 --> 00:00:13.890
how to find success on Play and
play games at the same time.

00:00:13.890 --> 00:00:14.893
Dan Galpin.

00:00:14.893 --> 00:00:15.839
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:21.500
That's from his Google+ bio.

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:23.774
I don't think he knows that.

00:00:23.774 --> 00:00:24.940
DAN GALPIN: Thank you, Rich.

00:00:24.940 --> 00:00:26.564
It is great to be
here in London again.

00:00:26.564 --> 00:00:29.870
So how many of you actually
were at GDC last week,

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:31.700
and saw some of
these presentations?

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:32.259
All right.

00:00:32.259 --> 00:00:35.880
For some of you this
is going to be review.

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:38.440
Don't worry, there will
be a quiz at the end.

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:40.310
It is great to be
here in London.

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:44.310
I love a chance to wear a
pea-coat this time of year.

00:00:44.310 --> 00:00:47.410
It's been about 75 or
80 degrees actually now

00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:49.790
in the valley in California.

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:55.380
So I wanted to start off talking
about the great momentum we

00:00:55.380 --> 00:00:56.820
have on Google Play.

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:59.000
And it's pretty exciting,
because right now,

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.250
the last number we released--
and this was a long time

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:04.180
ago-- talked about over one
billion activated Android

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:05.349
devices.

00:01:05.349 --> 00:01:09.090
And the other thing we know is
that three in four, in fact,

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:13.370
over three in four
Android users play games.

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:19.570
So this is just an
incredible opportunity

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:21.670
to grow an engaged
audience for your game.

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:24.050
But here is something
even cooler.

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:26.540
In the last six months
on Google Play games,

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:30.970
we've added over 75
million new users.

00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:33.470
So rapidly, rapidly
growing audience

00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:37.720
base that's very, very
engaged with gaming content.

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:40.030
So what is Google Play games?

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:42.690
All right, so we have
Achievements, Leaderboards,

00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:45.200
Cloud Save, and Multiplayer.

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:46.810
All the basic stuff
you would need.

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:49.300
Multiplayer we actually
have both real time

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:51.870
and turn-based multiplayer.

00:01:51.870 --> 00:01:53.780
And these are all
things that we've

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:58.060
proven to be really
valuable for gamers.

00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:01.270
So there's much
more to this network

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:03.750
though, than just a
collection of game services.

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:07.040
Ultimately, Play Games
is a concentrated network

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:09.410
of people who enjoy games.

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:12.350
In an ecosystem this large, it's
essential to bring the people

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:16.206
together and help you
connect them to your content.

00:02:16.206 --> 00:02:18.080
For those of you who
have adopted Play Games,

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:21.210
we review the data
that you've given us,

00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:25.952
and we've come up with these
kinds of basic statistics.

00:02:25.952 --> 00:02:27.660
We're talking about
high quality players.

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:32.420
We're talking about people who
are playing longer, more often,

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:34.370
and are more likely to monetize.

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:38.010
So again, Google Play
users fit this profile.

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:40.440
That's what we see
time and time again.

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:43.090
Now whether this is correlation
or causation is unclear,

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:46.590
but people who sign into Games
fit these characteristics.

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:49.170
They are your best game players.

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:52.010
But the question is, how do
you engage these players?

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:53.520
With such a diverse
audience, it's

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:55.700
important to think about
the thematics of your title

00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:58.790
and who it resonates with, and
what type of engagement appeals

00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:00.900
to them.

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:03.420
So one way to think about
engaging your audience

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:05.850
is, how open they are
to social interaction.

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:11.490
And which techniques are useful
for different gaming personas.

00:03:11.490 --> 00:03:15.299
Here at Android labs, we've
done extensive research.

00:03:15.299 --> 00:03:17.090
Which leads us to the
conclusion that there

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:20.000
are three fundamental
gamer archetypes.

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:20.930
We actually did this.

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:22.580
This is seriously
research that we did,

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:23.746
and we actually had a study.

00:03:23.746 --> 00:03:26.440
And we've named these
things multiple things,

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:29.750
but I like to refer to them as
the competitor, the achiever,

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:31.940
and the stealth gamer.

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:34.810
And you can plot these
on a graph-- again,

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:38.930
this is a highly scientific
study-- based upon openness.

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:41.790
So we have our least open
gamer to our most open gamer,

00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:46.480
in terms of being open
to social interaction.

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:50.150
At the open end of our scale,
the competitor archetype

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:51.630
engages in everything.

00:03:51.630 --> 00:03:54.050
Achievements, Leaderboards,
and Multiplayer.

00:03:54.050 --> 00:03:57.160
They thrive in competitive and
deep cooperative experiences.

00:03:57.160 --> 00:03:59.570
They own every console,
their personal home page

00:03:59.570 --> 00:04:01.760
lists their achievements.

00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:03.880
They play games on mobile
for the same reason

00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:06.990
that Captain Kirk climbed
mountains in Star Trek four,

00:04:06.990 --> 00:04:09.500
because they are there.

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:12.740
Achiever is on the other side
of the openness spectrum.

00:04:12.740 --> 00:04:15.300
They thrive in progression,
solving problems,

00:04:15.300 --> 00:04:16.476
revealing story.

00:04:16.476 --> 00:04:18.809
But they don't really want
to play in social situations.

00:04:18.809 --> 00:04:20.211
They're like OK, hold on.

00:04:20.211 --> 00:04:22.210
This is the mobile
equivalent of the people that

00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:24.310
work to earn a million
points in geometry wars

00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:27.057
without dying, just to
get the final achievement.

00:04:27.057 --> 00:04:28.515
The people who
played Final Fantasy

00:04:28.515 --> 00:04:31.930
VIII to get the two-minute
long Eden animation.

00:04:31.930 --> 00:04:33.900
Yes, like the
competitor, these guys

00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:37.440
are also looking for deeper
phone and tablet experiences.

00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:38.550
And this is our third one.

00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:39.883
This is kind of a funny persona.

00:04:39.883 --> 00:04:42.180
We actually refer to it
as the wolf, the stealth.

00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:44.900
They're like, I'm not a gamer!

00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:48.060
But they actually play
games every single day.

00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:50.350
And while they're
less likely to engage

00:04:50.350 --> 00:04:52.050
in direct social
interaction, they

00:04:52.050 --> 00:04:54.140
welcome passive interaction.

00:04:54.140 --> 00:04:56.620
This means they can be
engaged to help a friend,

00:04:56.620 --> 00:04:58.470
or compare themselves
to another player,

00:04:58.470 --> 00:05:00.984
so long as the social
interaction is fast,

00:05:00.984 --> 00:05:02.150
and the impact is immediate.

00:05:05.060 --> 00:05:08.090
So with these three
personas in mind,

00:05:08.090 --> 00:05:10.220
let's cover how
Play Games Services

00:05:10.220 --> 00:05:12.460
can help you reach each of them.

00:05:12.460 --> 00:05:14.890
So this guy's kind
of obvious, OK?

00:05:14.890 --> 00:05:16.130
Social Leaderboards.

00:05:16.130 --> 00:05:18.950
He wants to compete with
his friends, real-time

00:05:18.950 --> 00:05:20.450
and turn-based multiplayer.

00:05:20.450 --> 00:05:23.180
This guy's the competitor.

00:05:23.180 --> 00:05:25.750
So this is a game I've
been playing a lot,

00:05:25.750 --> 00:05:28.750
and these scores are
actually out of date.

00:05:28.750 --> 00:05:32.530
And I've been playing Smash
Hit not just because it's

00:05:32.530 --> 00:05:35.980
an awesome game, but because my
friends are playing the game.

00:05:35.980 --> 00:05:38.150
And I can't tell you
the countless hours

00:05:38.150 --> 00:05:40.420
I've put in, trying
to beat these scores.

00:05:40.420 --> 00:05:43.400
And even with all
of that, I'm still

00:05:43.400 --> 00:05:46.400
actually kind of suffering.

00:05:46.400 --> 00:05:47.150
And this is great.

00:05:47.150 --> 00:05:51.050
Because this is how this
engage player actually uses

00:05:51.050 --> 00:05:55.872
their social graph to both
compete within the game,

00:05:55.872 --> 00:05:57.580
but also to reach out
to friends and say,

00:05:57.580 --> 00:05:59.210
this is an awesome game.

00:05:59.210 --> 00:06:01.350
And by the way, I love the
way this game monetizes.

00:06:01.350 --> 00:06:03.665
It actually monetizes
based upon checkpoints,

00:06:03.665 --> 00:06:04.790
which is kind of brilliant.

00:06:04.790 --> 00:06:06.130
So you can play the
game from the start,

00:06:06.130 --> 00:06:07.570
but if you actually want
to progress in the game,

00:06:07.570 --> 00:06:08.736
you actually have to buy it.

00:06:11.420 --> 00:06:16.720
So real-time multiplayer is
also great for the competitor.

00:06:16.720 --> 00:06:19.030
All right, there
are how many games

00:06:19.030 --> 00:06:21.580
that are calling the same basic
game, sitting on Play Games

00:06:21.580 --> 00:06:22.320
right now.

00:06:22.320 --> 00:06:25.440
But this game was set apart,
because Clumsy Bird actually

00:06:25.440 --> 00:06:28.070
uses real-time auto-matching
to drive a tournament

00:06:28.070 --> 00:06:29.740
system between players.

00:06:29.740 --> 00:06:31.660
And this encourages
and rewards them

00:06:31.660 --> 00:06:35.100
to play together,
and more often.

00:06:35.100 --> 00:06:36.940
Auto-matching provides
instant access

00:06:36.940 --> 00:06:38.700
to both their own
social graph, as well as

00:06:38.700 --> 00:06:40.955
the entire set of
players that are actually

00:06:40.955 --> 00:06:41.830
playing the game now.

00:06:41.830 --> 00:06:44.390
So people get matched up
really, really quickly.

00:06:44.390 --> 00:06:46.930
But of course they also have
a way of inviting friends

00:06:46.930 --> 00:06:49.260
directly, which allows
them to not only grow

00:06:49.260 --> 00:06:50.830
the players in the
game, but it also

00:06:50.830 --> 00:06:54.710
allows people to actually
grow their graph of players.

00:06:54.710 --> 00:06:56.890
And in this game, they
actually further encourage me

00:06:56.890 --> 00:06:58.810
to compare myself to others.

00:06:58.810 --> 00:07:01.010
So how did my friend
beat my score?

00:07:01.010 --> 00:07:03.600
And where did they get that
awesome hat for their bird?

00:07:06.340 --> 00:07:08.160
And turn-based
multiplayer is another way

00:07:08.160 --> 00:07:10.400
to accomplish this kind
of social interaction,

00:07:10.400 --> 00:07:12.040
especially for
gameplay sessioms that

00:07:12.040 --> 00:07:14.760
can be completed incrementally
over a course of days.

00:07:14.760 --> 00:07:16.780
So in a similar way to
real-time multiplayer,

00:07:16.780 --> 00:07:18.930
matches can be played
by inviting friends,

00:07:18.930 --> 00:07:21.900
or auto-picking people
who are playing right now.

00:07:21.900 --> 00:07:24.590
And what makes the invite system
effective in encouraging repeat

00:07:24.590 --> 00:07:27.480
gameplay is showing players who
you've played with recently,

00:07:27.480 --> 00:07:29.800
or who are actively
playing the game.

00:07:29.800 --> 00:07:33.070
So for example, this
person, who is not me,

00:07:33.070 --> 00:07:34.910
is reminded that I
am playing the game.

00:07:34.910 --> 00:07:38.039
And yes, that is
me with long hair.

00:07:38.039 --> 00:07:39.580
And this is Frozen
Front, by the way.

00:07:39.580 --> 00:07:41.544
I just want to call
out to our friends

00:07:41.544 --> 00:07:43.960
at Handy Games for putting
together an awesome [INAUDIBLE]

00:07:43.960 --> 00:07:44.459
for us.

00:07:44.459 --> 00:07:47.300
Thank you.

00:07:47.300 --> 00:07:50.190
So when you receive a
notification to play a game,

00:07:50.190 --> 00:07:51.755
it's an opportunity
to install a game

00:07:51.755 --> 00:07:53.310
you weren't playing previously.

00:07:53.310 --> 00:07:55.619
In the next update with
Play Games Services, which

00:07:55.619 --> 00:07:57.410
is rolling out in the
next couple of weeks,

00:07:57.410 --> 00:08:01.240
we're introducing expanded
notifications for Play Games.

00:08:01.240 --> 00:08:03.100
And the goal of
these changes are

00:08:03.100 --> 00:08:05.070
to deliver multiplayer
and other requested game

00:08:05.070 --> 00:08:08.080
actions between users across
Google's social graph.

00:08:08.080 --> 00:08:10.490
The main change that users
are notified differently,

00:08:10.490 --> 00:08:13.920
based upon the priority
settings on their device.

00:08:13.920 --> 00:08:16.270
So what is actually
look like in real life?

00:08:16.270 --> 00:08:18.810
Once again, using Frozen
Front as an example,

00:08:18.810 --> 00:08:21.410
we've got a new
game action here.

00:08:21.410 --> 00:08:25.425
And so this first
example is a game action

00:08:25.425 --> 00:08:29.490
that came in from someone who
is actually in my circles.

00:08:29.490 --> 00:08:31.340
So it pops up, I can
see their picture,

00:08:31.340 --> 00:08:32.840
I see everything about them.

00:08:32.840 --> 00:08:35.252
The second one we've actually
aggregated a game action

00:08:35.252 --> 00:08:36.835
from someone who
wasn't in my circles.

00:08:36.835 --> 00:08:38.731
These show up silently.

00:08:38.731 --> 00:08:40.814
They show up along with
the rest of notifications,

00:08:40.814 --> 00:08:42.480
you see I've got one more.

00:08:42.480 --> 00:08:44.850
And then we actually
go into the screen,

00:08:44.850 --> 00:08:47.230
we now have the
ability to go and add

00:08:47.230 --> 00:08:49.240
this person to my circles.

00:08:49.240 --> 00:08:52.680
So one, you can directly
grow your game graph

00:08:52.680 --> 00:08:55.157
through these invitations,
your social gaming graph

00:08:55.157 --> 00:08:56.240
through these invitations.

00:08:56.240 --> 00:08:58.630
And two, we actually
aggregate these

00:08:58.630 --> 00:09:01.930
in a way that's very, very
low bandwidth for the user

00:09:01.930 --> 00:09:02.855
to deal with.

00:09:02.855 --> 00:09:05.450
I think both of those are
really critical to making people

00:09:05.450 --> 00:09:08.830
engage with, and
love, the service.

00:09:08.830 --> 00:09:12.300
So here's something that's
very near and dear to my heart.

00:09:12.300 --> 00:09:14.200
And these are actually
two of my friends.

00:09:14.200 --> 00:09:17.510
She has an Android device,
and he has an iPhone.

00:09:17.510 --> 00:09:20.400
And they do all sorts
of things together.

00:09:20.400 --> 00:09:23.420
They send each
other text messages,

00:09:23.420 --> 00:09:26.373
they send each
other emails, they

00:09:26.373 --> 00:09:27.623
can send each other snapchats.

00:09:30.780 --> 00:09:34.240
They can even make phone
calls with each other.

00:09:34.240 --> 00:09:39.530
But if they actually want to
play a game together, you know,

00:09:39.530 --> 00:09:40.770
it just doesn't happen.

00:09:40.770 --> 00:09:43.420
And the reason why is
that these games often

00:09:43.420 --> 00:09:45.460
use services that are
not cross-platform.

00:09:45.460 --> 00:09:48.740
So I wanted to really
emphasize this.

00:09:48.740 --> 00:09:51.690
From the very start
of Google Play Games,

00:09:51.690 --> 00:09:54.640
we have thought about this
as a cross-platform service.

00:09:54.640 --> 00:09:57.830
We support Android,
iOS, and the web

00:09:57.830 --> 00:09:59.630
for the vast majority
of our services.

00:09:59.630 --> 00:10:04.920
And we support Android and iOS
for things like multi-player.

00:10:04.920 --> 00:10:09.410
Because the truth is,
both of these platforms

00:10:09.410 --> 00:10:11.930
are really, really
important to our audience.

00:10:11.930 --> 00:10:14.430
And what's most important
to us is making sure

00:10:14.430 --> 00:10:16.630
that our audience
gets what they want.

00:10:16.630 --> 00:10:18.930
That our users are happy.

00:10:18.930 --> 00:10:24.830
So let's talk a
little bit about this.

00:10:24.830 --> 00:10:27.390
So for a long time
on Android we've had,

00:10:27.390 --> 00:10:30.820
and iOS, from day one we've
supported achievements,

00:10:30.820 --> 00:10:32.660
Cloud Save, and Leaderboards.

00:10:32.660 --> 00:10:34.390
And Cloud Save is
really, really awesome.

00:10:34.390 --> 00:10:36.420
Because there are
people that have,

00:10:36.420 --> 00:10:40.390
for example, an Android phone,
an iOS tablet, and vice versa.

00:10:40.390 --> 00:10:41.640
And it's really, really great.

00:10:41.640 --> 00:10:43.473
It's almost magical to
bring that experience

00:10:43.473 --> 00:10:47.060
from one device to the other,
and just have it carry over.

00:10:47.060 --> 00:10:49.440
And but for a long
time, multiplayer

00:10:49.440 --> 00:10:51.310
has been an
Android-only feature.

00:10:51.310 --> 00:10:53.540
So last week we
actually announced

00:10:53.540 --> 00:10:57.810
that full-blown both turn-based
and real-time multiplayer

00:10:57.810 --> 00:10:58.980
is coming to iOS.

00:10:58.980 --> 00:11:03.080
And let's start with
why you should care.

00:11:03.080 --> 00:11:06.970
Because in some ways, we know
this is going to be more work.

00:11:06.970 --> 00:11:11.060
You have to care about
different clients being in sync.

00:11:11.060 --> 00:11:13.830
But for starters, it's
a really cool trick.

00:11:16.650 --> 00:11:18.590
And we've been saying
forever that games

00:11:18.590 --> 00:11:20.240
are the original social.

00:11:20.240 --> 00:11:21.916
I mean, this is the
right thing to do.

00:11:21.916 --> 00:11:23.540
People want to play
with their friends,

00:11:23.540 --> 00:11:26.750
no matter what
devices they have.

00:11:26.750 --> 00:11:29.240
And frankly, you're going
to get a better matchmaking

00:11:29.240 --> 00:11:29.910
experience.

00:11:29.910 --> 00:11:33.470
I mean think about it this way,
a typical mobile multiplayer

00:11:33.470 --> 00:11:37.100
set up is a peer-to-peer network
that looks kind of like this.

00:11:37.100 --> 00:11:39.050
Well, I mean, with people.

00:11:39.050 --> 00:11:45.010
And basically all these
people are interconnected

00:11:45.010 --> 00:11:49.290
as you're playing
a real-time game.

00:11:49.290 --> 00:11:51.165
But if you have fewer
players-- look around--

00:11:51.165 --> 00:11:53.260
you've got fewer options.

00:11:53.260 --> 00:11:56.300
So for example,
our system might be

00:11:56.300 --> 00:11:58.680
matching some players
in San Francisco

00:11:58.680 --> 00:12:00.770
with a third player
in London, which

00:12:00.770 --> 00:12:03.662
has a slow connection to
those other two players

00:12:03.662 --> 00:12:04.370
in San Francisco.

00:12:04.370 --> 00:12:06.810
Not that London has slow
connections in general.

00:12:06.810 --> 00:12:10.475
And this may take longer to get
a fourth player into the match,

00:12:10.475 --> 00:12:11.630
so they might drop out.

00:12:11.630 --> 00:12:15.100
But the more devices you have
running your real-time game,

00:12:15.100 --> 00:12:16.870
the better chance
you have of actually

00:12:16.870 --> 00:12:19.280
getting fast, real-time
connections, which

00:12:19.280 --> 00:12:20.520
means more engaged players.

00:12:22.937 --> 00:12:24.520
Because if we take
our pool of players

00:12:24.520 --> 00:12:29.251
and we double it-- wait
for it-- double it!

00:12:29.251 --> 00:12:30.750
Oh wait, I clicked
the wrong button.

00:12:30.750 --> 00:12:33.060
There we are.

00:12:33.060 --> 00:12:35.790
We have not only that, not
only can we find more players,

00:12:35.790 --> 00:12:37.640
we can get them into
sessions faster.

00:12:37.640 --> 00:12:39.340
But they also have
better ping times,

00:12:39.340 --> 00:12:40.925
so they have a
better experience.

00:12:40.925 --> 00:12:42.175
I mean, don't they look happy?

00:12:46.370 --> 00:12:48.160
So that's what we
announced last week.

00:12:48.160 --> 00:12:49.890
This is a demo of a
game that's actually

00:12:49.890 --> 00:12:51.500
running on two separate devices.

00:12:51.500 --> 00:12:54.880
This is Battle Pillars, which
I think is really funny.

00:12:54.880 --> 00:12:58.150
And this is a real-time
game play session

00:12:58.150 --> 00:13:02.642
going between an iOS device
and an Android device.

00:13:02.642 --> 00:13:03.600
So this is pretty cool.

00:13:03.600 --> 00:13:08.317
You start it on one, and you
play it on both, together.

00:13:08.317 --> 00:13:10.150
And the experience is
actually really great.

00:13:10.150 --> 00:13:11.330
And it's really, really fun.

00:13:11.330 --> 00:13:13.780
And we want to see
more games like this.

00:13:13.780 --> 00:13:16.010
So the worked with us during
our early access program

00:13:16.010 --> 00:13:17.468
to actually make
this happen, so we

00:13:17.468 --> 00:13:20.445
could show there was one real
game that actually did this.

00:13:20.445 --> 00:13:21.830
But we want to see a lot more.

00:13:24.760 --> 00:13:28.520
OK, so that's what
we're announcing.

00:13:28.520 --> 00:13:32.980
Again, we attack this gamer
with cross-platform social

00:13:32.980 --> 00:13:35.260
discovery, with real-time
and turn-based multiplayer.

00:13:35.260 --> 00:13:36.950
We're going back to
our archetype here,

00:13:36.950 --> 00:13:38.000
this is our competitor.

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:39.791
We spend a lot of time
with the competitor,

00:13:39.791 --> 00:13:43.340
because it's a lot like me.

00:13:43.340 --> 00:13:45.910
But I'm also a
lot like this guy.

00:13:45.910 --> 00:13:51.090
And this is our
achievement-based guy.

00:13:51.090 --> 00:13:53.900
He likes to go into
deep gaming experiences.

00:13:53.900 --> 00:13:55.380
And so social
leaderboards actually

00:13:55.380 --> 00:13:56.420
work really, really
well for him,

00:13:56.420 --> 00:13:58.440
because he's always
looking for the next thing.

00:13:58.440 --> 00:14:01.450
But he also is really
into games that are deep.

00:14:01.450 --> 00:14:02.950
And so we want
quality achievements.

00:14:02.950 --> 00:14:04.408
And what do I mean
when I say this?

00:14:04.408 --> 00:14:06.590
Well I mean really
designing good achievements.

00:14:06.590 --> 00:14:09.180
And this is not something
that's specific to mobile.

00:14:09.180 --> 00:14:12.420
This is something that
actually works everywhere.

00:14:12.420 --> 00:14:14.430
So this is a great game, OK?

00:14:14.430 --> 00:14:17.390
I don't know who here
has played Plague, Inc.

00:14:17.390 --> 00:14:20.590
But when you finish the
game, you're not done.

00:14:20.590 --> 00:14:22.550
Because it turns out
there's a whole bunch more

00:14:22.550 --> 00:14:25.470
to do once you've destroyed
the world with plague.

00:14:25.470 --> 00:14:28.392
For example, here
are the acheivements,

00:14:28.392 --> 00:14:30.940
and it's a guideline
of what I can do.

00:14:30.940 --> 00:14:32.932
I can cause World War III.

00:14:32.932 --> 00:14:36.910
I can infect astronauts
with a plague in space.

00:14:36.910 --> 00:14:38.380
And this is awesome.

00:14:38.380 --> 00:14:40.780
And that's what
achievements are all about.

00:14:40.780 --> 00:14:43.339
They're all about, hey, I
finished the core experience,

00:14:43.339 --> 00:14:44.880
but there's so much
more that I could

00:14:44.880 --> 00:14:49.070
have done during the game that
will take so much more time.

00:14:49.070 --> 00:14:51.779
And it gives you a guideline,
it gives your users

00:14:51.779 --> 00:14:53.570
a guideline to know
exactly how to do this.

00:14:53.570 --> 00:14:56.741
How am I going to waste the
next 40 hours of my life?

00:14:56.741 --> 00:14:57.240
OK?

00:14:57.240 --> 00:14:59.330
That's it, right there.

00:14:59.330 --> 00:15:02.290
And it's going to be fun.

00:15:02.290 --> 00:15:06.530
OK, so the point is that
achievements actually matter.

00:15:06.530 --> 00:15:09.890
And I love this slide,
just because it's

00:15:09.890 --> 00:15:10.770
so incredibly goofy.

00:15:10.770 --> 00:15:12.620
The guy's like, gameficiation!

00:15:12.620 --> 00:15:15.250
And she's like, well, have
some Series A funding.

00:15:15.250 --> 00:15:18.900
But this is actually
a great presentation

00:15:18.900 --> 00:15:20.280
that Todd put together.

00:15:20.280 --> 00:15:22.689
You can see it here,
at this short link,

00:15:22.689 --> 00:15:23.980
which I'll keep up for a while.

00:15:23.980 --> 00:15:25.170
But you can also hunt it.

00:15:25.170 --> 00:15:26.878
So this is our Play
Games best practices.

00:15:26.878 --> 00:15:28.450
This is a slide we
did at GDC Next,

00:15:28.450 --> 00:15:31.145
down in Los Angeles last year.

00:15:31.145 --> 00:15:31.770
And it's great.

00:15:31.770 --> 00:15:34.260
It goes through not just
talking about achievements,

00:15:34.260 --> 00:15:36.010
but it actually talks
about all the things

00:15:36.010 --> 00:15:37.900
we've learned about
the services, why we've

00:15:37.900 --> 00:15:40.360
changed some of
the things we do.

00:15:40.360 --> 00:15:42.380
For example, this
talk actually goes

00:15:42.380 --> 00:15:45.670
into great detail about
why it actually turned out

00:15:45.670 --> 00:15:49.525
to be better to immediately
pop up a dialogue saying,

00:15:49.525 --> 00:15:51.400
hey, would you like to
play with your friends

00:15:51.400 --> 00:15:53.390
when the game first
launched, rather than just

00:15:53.390 --> 00:15:55.990
using the sign-in button.

00:15:55.990 --> 00:15:57.859
And this is again,
this explains all

00:15:57.859 --> 00:15:59.650
of our logic behind
the changes we've made.

00:15:59.650 --> 00:16:00.983
It's a really, really good deck.

00:16:00.983 --> 00:16:04.540
So you should
definitely check it out.

00:16:04.540 --> 00:16:07.250
All right, let's
talk about how we

00:16:07.250 --> 00:16:11.170
find this guy, this not
particularly social gamer, how

00:16:11.170 --> 00:16:13.180
we help them find games.

00:16:13.180 --> 00:16:15.640
So let's talk about all the
things we do to help people

00:16:15.640 --> 00:16:16.530
find games.

00:16:16.530 --> 00:16:20.087
So first of all, everyone
knows about reviews.

00:16:20.087 --> 00:16:22.420
And what's cool about this
is, you can see first of all,

00:16:22.420 --> 00:16:23.920
this is actually from my device.

00:16:23.920 --> 00:16:28.370
And you can see I see the
reviews by my friends, OK?

00:16:28.370 --> 00:16:30.220
And you see they all
really like this game,

00:16:30.220 --> 00:16:32.890
which made me go
and download it.

00:16:32.890 --> 00:16:35.690
Then of course we
also have the badges

00:16:35.690 --> 00:16:37.120
that appear in the Play store.

00:16:37.120 --> 00:16:39.570
So when you integrate
Play Games Services,

00:16:39.570 --> 00:16:42.290
you get multiplayer,
achievement, leaderboard badges

00:16:42.290 --> 00:16:44.720
showing up for your game, OK?

00:16:44.720 --> 00:16:47.080
And what we find
out is that people

00:16:47.080 --> 00:16:51.490
who don't integrate Play Games
Services get lower reviews.

00:16:51.490 --> 00:16:54.570
You'll get reviews saying,
one star, I want Cloud Save.

00:16:54.570 --> 00:16:57.120
One star, where are
my achievements?

00:16:57.120 --> 00:16:58.890
So it actually is
really, really cool.

00:16:58.890 --> 00:17:03.660
People like having
access to this.

00:17:03.660 --> 00:17:06.079
In addition, of course
you have recently played.

00:17:06.079 --> 00:17:08.040
So you can look at any
one of your friends

00:17:08.040 --> 00:17:10.770
and see what they're
actually playing.

00:17:10.770 --> 00:17:14.210
So I know, for example, Rich
is always playing a good game.

00:17:14.210 --> 00:17:18.129
In this case I know that Greg
is always playing cool games.

00:17:18.129 --> 00:17:20.170
Well, I mean, well, OK,
he's playing Clumsy Bird.

00:17:20.170 --> 00:17:22.020
But other than that.

00:17:22.020 --> 00:17:23.884
Not to bag on the
Clumsy Bird guys,

00:17:23.884 --> 00:17:25.300
they've actually
done a great job.

00:17:25.300 --> 00:17:29.170
I'm just not a huge fan of
that particular game play.

00:17:29.170 --> 00:17:30.840
And as well as
recommended games.

00:17:30.840 --> 00:17:33.530
Here are your popular
multiplayer games, for example.

00:17:33.530 --> 00:17:36.070
So I can find out all the
other cool multiplayer

00:17:36.070 --> 00:17:38.720
games that are
going on that people

00:17:38.720 --> 00:17:41.750
are playing in Play
Games Services.

00:17:41.750 --> 00:17:45.710
As well as actual search.

00:17:45.710 --> 00:17:46.759
So this is pretty cool.

00:17:46.759 --> 00:17:48.300
When I search, once
again, I can find

00:17:48.300 --> 00:17:50.350
these titles are integrating
Play Game Services.

00:17:50.350 --> 00:17:52.110
And then of course
within Google Play

00:17:52.110 --> 00:17:54.300
we have revamped all of
our gaming categories,

00:17:54.300 --> 00:17:55.950
so they make sense.

00:17:55.950 --> 00:17:57.410
So that was
something we've done.

00:17:57.410 --> 00:17:59.577
We finally are
rolling it out now.

00:17:59.577 --> 00:18:00.660
So you're seeing that now.

00:18:00.660 --> 00:18:02.220
You're seeing the
impact of that now.

00:18:02.220 --> 00:18:03.740
People are able
to find the games

00:18:03.740 --> 00:18:06.410
that they want, in the
categories they want, much more

00:18:06.410 --> 00:18:08.040
easily than before.

00:18:08.040 --> 00:18:11.220
18 new categories.

00:18:11.220 --> 00:18:14.377
So we've got this guy.

00:18:14.377 --> 00:18:16.210
And the question is,
how do we approach him?

00:18:16.210 --> 00:18:18.960
And yes, we know that
sign in with Cloud Save

00:18:18.960 --> 00:18:20.480
is really important to this guy.

00:18:20.480 --> 00:18:23.210
It's important to everyone.

00:18:23.210 --> 00:18:25.920
And I can't stress this, we
stressed it in the first talk

00:18:25.920 --> 00:18:26.690
as well.

00:18:26.690 --> 00:18:31.870
But sign in with Cloud Save
is really, really important.

00:18:31.870 --> 00:18:36.540
Because people are often
buying things within your game.

00:18:36.540 --> 00:18:38.830
And if they feel like
their purchases are

00:18:38.830 --> 00:18:41.270
going to be lost because
they lost their phone,

00:18:41.270 --> 00:18:43.800
or because they upgrade
to a new device,

00:18:43.800 --> 00:18:46.460
that makes them less
likely to want to purchase.

00:18:46.460 --> 00:18:48.330
And we actually have
this anecdotally.

00:18:48.330 --> 00:18:51.410
So one of our good
friends actually

00:18:51.410 --> 00:18:54.059
kept getting request
after request

00:18:54.059 --> 00:18:56.100
after request from gamers,
please, please, please

00:18:56.100 --> 00:18:57.400
put in Cloud Save.

00:18:57.400 --> 00:18:59.380
They integrated it, and boom.

00:18:59.380 --> 00:19:03.240
The next day they saw
massive increases in sales.

00:19:03.240 --> 00:19:05.700
People were literally
waiting for that.

00:19:05.700 --> 00:19:08.420
So again, Cloud Save is
really, really important.

00:19:08.420 --> 00:19:10.260
But for these guys,
we really have

00:19:10.260 --> 00:19:13.480
anything for social
discovery, until last week.

00:19:13.480 --> 00:19:14.870
So this is cool.

00:19:14.870 --> 00:19:18.240
We've actually added a
new feature to play games.

00:19:18.240 --> 00:19:19.670
Which is game gifts.

00:19:19.670 --> 00:19:21.350
Which is exciting.

00:19:21.350 --> 00:19:23.350
A lot of people have asked
us, how do I do this?

00:19:23.350 --> 00:19:24.933
In fact there are
people who are using

00:19:24.933 --> 00:19:26.707
multiplayer that try to do this.

00:19:26.707 --> 00:19:28.790
This is really, if you
want to actually get people

00:19:28.790 --> 00:19:31.270
into the social
graph of your game,

00:19:31.270 --> 00:19:33.030
this is actually a
great way of doing it.

00:19:33.030 --> 00:19:34.450
I'm going to talk about it.

00:19:34.450 --> 00:19:36.675
So here's how it actually looks.

00:19:36.675 --> 00:19:39.050
And I'm actually going to put
some code up on the screen,

00:19:39.050 --> 00:19:41.216
since I know a bunch of you
are actually developers.

00:19:41.216 --> 00:19:44.210
So don't be scared.

00:19:44.210 --> 00:19:46.330
And of course an extra
life looks like a mushroom.

00:19:46.330 --> 00:19:50.460
It's the universal
symbol for an extra life.

00:19:50.460 --> 00:19:52.130
So here's what the
flow looks like.

00:19:52.130 --> 00:19:54.190
OK, first of all,
someone in the game

00:19:54.190 --> 00:19:56.570
says, I want to send an extra
life to one of my friends.

00:19:56.570 --> 00:19:59.254
And this is the code
that you use to do that.

00:19:59.254 --> 00:20:00.920
And it's really,
really straightforward.

00:20:00.920 --> 00:20:03.545
You say, give me an
intent, start an activity.

00:20:03.545 --> 00:20:08.000
And that Intent contains a
payload of whatever you want,

00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:10.625
how long you want to
live, in days, an icon,

00:20:10.625 --> 00:20:13.142
and a description.

00:20:13.142 --> 00:20:13.725
And that's it.

00:20:13.725 --> 00:20:15.180
That's all you have
to do to actually send

00:20:15.180 --> 00:20:17.690
a gift, one line of code,
two lines of code, actually.

00:20:17.690 --> 00:20:19.620
I lied.

00:20:19.620 --> 00:20:21.200
And then, from
there, we actually

00:20:21.200 --> 00:20:22.980
pop up this screen
saying, hey, who

00:20:22.980 --> 00:20:24.500
do you want to send a gift to?

00:20:24.500 --> 00:20:25.740
In this screen it's me.

00:20:25.740 --> 00:20:27.320
Everyone send gifts to me.

00:20:27.320 --> 00:20:30.130
That's a subtle hint.

00:20:30.130 --> 00:20:32.020
Finally it goes into our cloud.

00:20:32.020 --> 00:20:36.300
And then from there we
actually send a notification.

00:20:36.300 --> 00:20:38.840
In this case from me to me.

00:20:38.840 --> 00:20:40.480
And then, aha!

00:20:40.480 --> 00:20:42.690
I get an aggregate list of
all the gifts and requests

00:20:42.690 --> 00:20:43.606
that people have made.

00:20:43.606 --> 00:20:44.830
So this is not just gifts.

00:20:44.830 --> 00:20:48.510
This actually shows other
social interactions as well.

00:20:48.510 --> 00:20:50.440
And then finally I
can accept the gift.

00:20:50.440 --> 00:20:51.910
And then, if the
game's installed,

00:20:51.910 --> 00:20:53.743
I just go to the game
and I accept the gift.

00:20:53.743 --> 00:20:55.440
Otherwise I go to
Google Play Store,

00:20:55.440 --> 00:20:57.060
and then I can install the game.

00:20:57.060 --> 00:20:58.700
So I can then accept the gift.

00:20:58.700 --> 00:21:00.820
And then this is what
actually happens.

00:21:00.820 --> 00:21:04.540
So after I sign in, what
I'm going to want to do

00:21:04.540 --> 00:21:06.530
is actually get any
requests that are pending.

00:21:06.530 --> 00:21:08.530
And that's how I actually
go to accept the gift.

00:21:08.530 --> 00:21:09.700
Again, not a lot of code here.

00:21:09.700 --> 00:21:11.449
If you're already using
Play Game Services

00:21:11.449 --> 00:21:14.370
this is just like
one extra line.

00:21:14.370 --> 00:21:17.200
And then I actually
handle the requests.

00:21:17.200 --> 00:21:19.610
And then finally, it comes back.

00:21:19.610 --> 00:21:21.700
It calls me back and says,
yes indeed, these gifts

00:21:21.700 --> 00:21:22.640
have been accepted.

00:21:22.640 --> 00:21:25.330
And I can put whatever code
I have right here in order

00:21:25.330 --> 00:21:25.830
to accept.

00:21:25.830 --> 00:21:27.160
And I can do just
more than gifts,

00:21:27.160 --> 00:21:28.201
I can actually do wishes.

00:21:28.201 --> 00:21:30.735
So you can see this little
guy here is going help!

00:21:30.735 --> 00:21:33.000
So I can also ask for
extra life, for example.

00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:34.242
Or ask for help.

00:21:34.242 --> 00:21:35.950
So I can actually send
a gift to someone,

00:21:35.950 --> 00:21:40.420
or I can do a
request for a gift.

00:21:40.420 --> 00:21:44.860
So once again,
one up successful.

00:21:44.860 --> 00:21:46.210
All right.

00:21:46.210 --> 00:21:48.735
Now the other thing, this is
kind of a complicated flow.

00:21:48.735 --> 00:21:50.710
So you can actually
register for a note

00:21:50.710 --> 00:21:54.230
to be notified that gifts
have come to your app.

00:21:54.230 --> 00:21:57.220
So you'll just get a
notification when they come in.

00:21:57.220 --> 00:22:01.440
And you can show the request
inbox from within your game.

00:22:01.440 --> 00:22:03.570
But you can actually
use the gifting system

00:22:03.570 --> 00:22:04.930
for much more than just that.

00:22:04.930 --> 00:22:09.294
You can also use it to
trade items between players.

00:22:09.294 --> 00:22:10.710
Because I didn't
actually show you

00:22:10.710 --> 00:22:14.322
everything when I showed
you this first graph.

00:22:14.322 --> 00:22:15.780
There's something
missing, which is

00:22:15.780 --> 00:22:17.350
that after you've
accepted the gift,

00:22:17.350 --> 00:22:19.830
you actually get a
notification back saying,

00:22:19.830 --> 00:22:21.470
yes, this person
accepted the gift.

00:22:21.470 --> 00:22:23.500
Which means you can
use the same gifting

00:22:23.500 --> 00:22:25.739
system to actually
do things like trade.

00:22:25.739 --> 00:22:28.280
So instead of accepting the gift
here, I could have said hey,

00:22:28.280 --> 00:22:29.720
do you want to make this trade?

00:22:29.720 --> 00:22:32.581
And then it actually says
sure, and now it trades it.

00:22:32.581 --> 00:22:34.580
You can even have it go
through multiple rounds.

00:22:34.580 --> 00:22:36.140
You could actually
have hey, no I

00:22:36.140 --> 00:22:38.390
don't want to accept
that gift, so I say no.

00:22:38.390 --> 00:22:40.794
But then I actually want to
say but I'll do this instead.

00:22:40.794 --> 00:22:42.710
And you can actually
have these really complex

00:22:42.710 --> 00:22:45.150
social interactions going
in loops, between people

00:22:45.150 --> 00:22:48.710
negotiating for gifts that they
might want to have or trade.

00:22:48.710 --> 00:22:51.000
So again, this is pretty cool.

00:22:51.000 --> 00:22:53.980
And again, it allows you
to grow your social graph.

00:22:53.980 --> 00:22:56.600
If they don't have the
game, they can get the game.

00:22:56.600 --> 00:22:58.200
If they're not in
your circles, they

00:22:58.200 --> 00:23:00.150
can become part of your circles.

00:23:00.150 --> 00:23:01.400
So that's both very important.

00:23:01.400 --> 00:23:03.140
You can actually do this
just by an email address.

00:23:03.140 --> 00:23:04.848
If you've got a email
address of someone,

00:23:04.848 --> 00:23:07.870
you can actually start
this whole process off.

00:23:07.870 --> 00:23:11.990
All right, so those are
our three archetypes.

00:23:11.990 --> 00:23:16.980
And the question is, how do you
know whether you're actually

00:23:16.980 --> 00:23:19.520
being successful
in targeting them?

00:23:19.520 --> 00:23:21.476
We talked about
analytics, and everyone

00:23:21.476 --> 00:23:23.100
should be integrating
Google Analytics,

00:23:23.100 --> 00:23:25.120
and we're going to talk more
about that later on today.

00:23:25.120 --> 00:23:27.578
But what I'm talking about is
something slightly different.

00:23:27.578 --> 00:23:29.960
Just by using Play
Games you actually

00:23:29.960 --> 00:23:32.285
get free statistics
and analytics

00:23:32.285 --> 00:23:34.140
of how your game is performing.

00:23:34.140 --> 00:23:35.140
And this is pretty cool.

00:23:35.140 --> 00:23:39.950
So we actually give you
these zero effort statistics

00:23:39.950 --> 00:23:42.620
as part of the daily dashboard.

00:23:42.620 --> 00:23:45.350
So let's take a
closer look at that.

00:23:45.350 --> 00:23:48.890
All right, that's
a little too close.

00:23:48.890 --> 00:23:53.710
But in all seriousness,
we give you

00:23:53.710 --> 00:23:55.700
key metrics for
signed-in games players.

00:23:55.700 --> 00:23:58.830
So including recent metrics
around new and active players,

00:23:58.830 --> 00:24:01.180
and how well you're
retaining them.

00:24:01.180 --> 00:24:03.620
So this is really
cool, check this out.

00:24:03.620 --> 00:24:05.960
Right in the service
you can see whoa,

00:24:05.960 --> 00:24:07.460
those are my retention numbers.

00:24:07.460 --> 00:24:09.080
That's really, really awesome.

00:24:09.080 --> 00:24:11.940
Like, makes me super happy.

00:24:11.940 --> 00:24:15.080
You can also see, what
are my top achievements?

00:24:15.080 --> 00:24:20.670
And to see if your players
are actually staying engaged.

00:24:20.670 --> 00:24:23.320
So once again, all this stuff
I wish we had from day one,

00:24:23.320 --> 00:24:24.480
we have now.

00:24:24.480 --> 00:24:28.270
So not only do you get,
with Play Games Services,

00:24:28.270 --> 00:24:30.860
do you get actual people, more
people in your social graph,

00:24:30.860 --> 00:24:32.943
you get more people playing
the game and engaging,

00:24:32.943 --> 00:24:34.870
and you can actually see
whether it's working.

00:24:34.870 --> 00:24:37.650
Which is really cool.

00:24:37.650 --> 00:24:39.700
And there's more
than this, of course.

00:24:39.700 --> 00:24:42.320
You can also see
how many new users

00:24:42.320 --> 00:24:43.680
started playing your game.

00:24:43.680 --> 00:24:45.760
Which ones remain
active, and how well

00:24:45.760 --> 00:24:47.210
you're retaining
them days later.

00:24:47.210 --> 00:24:49.180
So imagine you released
an update to your game

00:24:49.180 --> 00:24:51.690
with brand new levels and
characters, in an effort

00:24:51.690 --> 00:24:53.910
to attract an
existing player back.

00:24:53.910 --> 00:24:56.610
This active player report
and these trend lines

00:24:56.610 --> 00:24:59.104
will actually show you if
you accomplished that goal.

00:24:59.104 --> 00:25:00.770
And how that compared
to the game update

00:25:00.770 --> 00:25:01.811
you released a month ago.

00:25:05.460 --> 00:25:10.900
This is also another critical
tool, the retention dashboard.

00:25:10.900 --> 00:25:14.320
So this helps you understand
your ever-critical new player

00:25:14.320 --> 00:25:15.304
return rate.

00:25:15.304 --> 00:25:17.220
So this will show your
new player return rates

00:25:17.220 --> 00:25:19.381
after 1, 2, 7, and 30 days.

00:25:19.381 --> 00:25:21.380
So let's say you updated
your game on March 8th,

00:25:21.380 --> 00:25:23.150
with a new game tutorial flow.

00:25:23.150 --> 00:25:25.490
You can easily see that
your game increased day two

00:25:25.490 --> 00:25:28.580
conversion, by more than
10% after that update.

00:25:28.580 --> 00:25:32.080
Validating that you've improved
your game for early players.

00:25:32.080 --> 00:25:34.135
Now come on, is this not cool?

00:25:34.135 --> 00:25:36.260
Does anyone think this is
not cool in the audience?

00:25:36.260 --> 00:25:38.600
I mean this is really cool.

00:25:38.600 --> 00:25:40.890
You can see someone who
started playing here,

00:25:40.890 --> 00:25:42.390
and what percentage
of them is still

00:25:42.390 --> 00:25:45.310
playing day 2 and
day 7 and day 30.

00:25:49.220 --> 00:25:52.015
And our engagement dashboard
rounds out the new updates.

00:25:52.015 --> 00:25:53.390
So now you get
trend line reports

00:25:53.390 --> 00:25:55.800
across all of your achievements,
and the scores post

00:25:55.800 --> 00:25:57.320
across your leaderboards.

00:25:57.320 --> 00:25:59.060
This comes in
handy to understand

00:25:59.060 --> 00:26:01.509
how you're appealing to
the achievers of the world.

00:26:01.509 --> 00:26:04.050
Now you'll see that achievement
you added last week is really

00:26:04.050 --> 00:26:06.720
getting players to finish the
final dungeon of your game.

00:26:06.720 --> 00:26:08.460
Or that new tournament
mode is actually

00:26:08.460 --> 00:26:10.730
succeeding, by looking
at the increased

00:26:10.730 --> 00:26:13.720
activity on a new leaderboard.

00:26:13.720 --> 00:26:16.850
So enhanced Play Games
Statistics is just rolled out.

00:26:16.850 --> 00:26:19.360
You should all see
it in your dashboards

00:26:19.360 --> 00:26:21.120
now if you're already
using Play Games.

00:26:21.120 --> 00:26:22.890
And again, we think this is
going to be really, really

00:26:22.890 --> 00:26:25.120
useful to help you not only
understand your players,

00:26:25.120 --> 00:26:27.170
but also understand how
these services are actually

00:26:27.170 --> 00:26:27.794
being valuable.

00:26:30.410 --> 00:26:33.100
All right, so let's
do a quick recap.

00:26:33.100 --> 00:26:35.154
We learned today that
Google Play games

00:26:35.154 --> 00:26:36.570
can help your game
perform better.

00:26:36.570 --> 00:26:39.110
And it does this by connecting
your game to higher quality

00:26:39.110 --> 00:26:41.960
users who play more often,
play longer, and are

00:26:41.960 --> 00:26:43.900
more likely to monetize.

00:26:43.900 --> 00:26:46.570
You can gauge the most
competitive of our users

00:26:46.570 --> 00:26:48.490
through social capabilities.

00:26:48.490 --> 00:26:51.490
And we announced game gifts
to help reach players who

00:26:51.490 --> 00:26:53.891
enjoy passive
social experiences.

00:26:53.891 --> 00:26:55.890
You can improve the
discoverability of your game

00:26:55.890 --> 00:26:58.270
with Play Games
through notifications,

00:26:58.270 --> 00:27:01.070
and through additional
exposure in the Play Games App.

00:27:01.070 --> 00:27:03.470
And with enhanced play
games statistics-- oh sorry,

00:27:03.470 --> 00:27:05.450
I forget about this,
guys-- and of course,

00:27:05.450 --> 00:27:08.620
you guys should always consider
cross-platform multiplayer

00:27:08.620 --> 00:27:11.100
to help engage your
most important players.

00:27:11.100 --> 00:27:12.070
Help!

00:27:12.070 --> 00:27:14.960
And then finally, we introduce
Play Games Statistics.

00:27:14.960 --> 00:27:17.320
So it's now easier than
ever to measure your success

00:27:17.320 --> 00:27:20.990
through player and
engagement analytics.

00:27:20.990 --> 00:27:24.400
OK, there is one more
thing I wanted to mention.

00:27:24.400 --> 00:27:29.150
And that is no Java required.

00:27:29.150 --> 00:27:32.680
We have a complete
Unity plug-in,

00:27:32.680 --> 00:27:37.010
and we are working on a
C++-based integration.

00:27:37.010 --> 00:27:38.910
And these are both
really, really cool.

00:27:38.910 --> 00:27:42.530
Because we have heard from
you that not all of you

00:27:42.530 --> 00:27:47.680
use Java as your primary
programming language.

00:27:47.680 --> 00:27:50.180
So let's talk about Unity.

00:27:50.180 --> 00:27:52.990
So up until last week, you
had Achievements, Cloud Save,

00:27:52.990 --> 00:27:56.330
and Leaderboards in Unity, and
that's totally cross-platform.

00:27:56.330 --> 00:27:59.440
Now we have both turn-based and
real-time multiplayer as well,

00:27:59.440 --> 00:28:01.030
as part of our
own Unity plug-in.

00:28:01.030 --> 00:28:05.310
This is an open source plug-in
that's available on GitHub.

00:28:05.310 --> 00:28:06.900
So once again, you
can download this.

00:28:06.900 --> 00:28:09.990
You can modify it, you can
do whatever you want with it.

00:28:09.990 --> 00:28:13.540
It is just a cool way of
talking to our services.

00:28:13.540 --> 00:28:15.550
Here's an example
of a game that we

00:28:15.550 --> 00:28:18.920
wrote using our Unity plug-in.

00:28:18.920 --> 00:28:21.160
It takes the excitement
out of car racing,

00:28:21.160 --> 00:28:22.470
and replaces it with math.

00:28:25.610 --> 00:28:28.270
But what's really,
really cool is

00:28:28.270 --> 00:28:30.690
that there were no code
changes between this

00:28:30.690 --> 00:28:32.520
to run cross platform.

00:28:32.520 --> 00:28:34.460
This is exactly the same code.

00:28:34.460 --> 00:28:36.660
It's using real-time
multiplayer.

00:28:36.660 --> 00:28:39.160
It's just that easy
with our Unity plug-in.

00:28:39.160 --> 00:28:41.410
How many of you out there
are using Unity, by the way?

00:28:41.410 --> 00:28:43.060
Show of hands.

00:28:43.060 --> 00:28:43.952
OK, that's good.

00:28:43.952 --> 00:28:45.660
It's always nice to
know we did something

00:28:45.660 --> 00:28:47.712
that people might find useful.

00:28:47.712 --> 00:28:49.170
And it's really,
really easy to do.

00:28:49.170 --> 00:28:51.020
You just import
a custom package.

00:28:51.020 --> 00:28:52.980
On Android you just put
in the application ID.

00:28:52.980 --> 00:28:54.710
That's the only
Android-specific work

00:28:54.710 --> 00:28:56.550
you have to do to use
our Unity plug-in.

00:28:56.550 --> 00:28:59.610
On iOS you have to put in an
OAuth client ID and bundle

00:28:59.610 --> 00:29:00.450
identifier.

00:29:00.450 --> 00:29:01.530
And that's it.

00:29:01.530 --> 00:29:03.480
That is the only
specific code that

00:29:03.480 --> 00:29:07.650
was done to make that
game run cross-platform,

00:29:07.650 --> 00:29:11.830
with real-time
multiplayer on Unity.

00:29:11.830 --> 00:29:16.500
So that's hugely,
hugely powerful.

00:29:16.500 --> 00:29:19.240
And it's a single API.

00:29:19.240 --> 00:29:23.570
Again, so this is actually
how you go and invite people.

00:29:23.570 --> 00:29:25.189
Boom.

00:29:25.189 --> 00:29:26.730
And that's what it
looks like on iOS,

00:29:26.730 --> 00:29:28.540
by the way, for people who
haven't actually seen it.

00:29:28.540 --> 00:29:29.940
It looks really good on iOS.

00:29:29.940 --> 00:29:31.430
They've done a nice job.

00:29:31.430 --> 00:29:34.060
This is the call to
invite my friends.

00:29:34.060 --> 00:29:36.730
But what about you who
don't use game engines,

00:29:36.730 --> 00:29:37.850
or have build your own?

00:29:37.850 --> 00:29:40.560
How many out here have actually
built your own game engine,

00:29:40.560 --> 00:29:44.260
or use something other
than Unity out there?

00:29:44.260 --> 00:29:44.790
All right.

00:29:44.790 --> 00:29:46.130
So more people.

00:29:46.130 --> 00:29:48.797
OK, so we have
recognized that there's

00:29:48.797 --> 00:29:51.130
an inordinate number of people
who want to do this, too.

00:29:51.130 --> 00:29:55.750
So before, in the old world,
you took your C++ game engine,

00:29:55.750 --> 00:29:58.410
then you add some #IFDEFs, then
you had some JNI and you talked

00:29:58.410 --> 00:30:01.000
to a Java library, which
would then talk to Play Games

00:30:01.000 --> 00:30:01.880
Searches underneath.

00:30:01.880 --> 00:30:03.940
And then under iOS
you would use #IFDEFs

00:30:03.940 --> 00:30:05.957
and you would talk to
our Objective C library.

00:30:05.957 --> 00:30:07.540
And that was a lot
of work, and people

00:30:07.540 --> 00:30:08.623
complained about it a lot.

00:30:08.623 --> 00:30:11.460
And it's easy to get JNI wrong
if you haven't done it before.

00:30:11.460 --> 00:30:14.160
And it turns out most people
who build game engines are not

00:30:14.160 --> 00:30:16.156
necessarily JNI experts.

00:30:16.156 --> 00:30:18.030
And then different
versions of Android, we've

00:30:18.030 --> 00:30:21.014
actually made our stuff more
JNI compliant over time.

00:30:21.014 --> 00:30:23.180
So unless you're testing
against the latest version,

00:30:23.180 --> 00:30:24.680
you might not
realized your JNI code

00:30:24.680 --> 00:30:27.620
doesn't work, et
cetera, et cetera.

00:30:27.620 --> 00:30:29.960
And then there's art
VM that's thrown in,

00:30:29.960 --> 00:30:31.530
which has added even more fun.

00:30:31.530 --> 00:30:34.120
Because we've ratcheted down
our JNI even more for that.

00:30:34.120 --> 00:30:35.549
So we've made this easy.

00:30:35.549 --> 00:30:37.965
We've actually created a C++
library that your game engine

00:30:37.965 --> 00:30:40.510
can talk to that's
completely cross-platform.

00:30:40.510 --> 00:30:42.560
So the API is entirely
cross-platform,

00:30:42.560 --> 00:30:46.810
it's exactly the same on
iOS as it is on Android.

00:30:46.810 --> 00:30:49.339
And the great thing
about that is, again, you

00:30:49.339 --> 00:30:50.630
don't have to modify your code.

00:30:50.630 --> 00:30:53.020
You can talk straight
to our C++ library.

00:30:53.020 --> 00:30:56.240
Now this is still
an early release.

00:30:56.240 --> 00:30:59.480
And does a lot more than just
talking to our REST endpoints.

00:30:59.480 --> 00:31:03.410
So our C++ library automatically
does all the OAuth 2.0

00:31:03.410 --> 00:31:04.540
management for you.

00:31:04.540 --> 00:31:05.920
If you're on
Android, it actually

00:31:05.920 --> 00:31:10.150
makes calls through JNI to
our actual Play Games Services

00:31:10.150 --> 00:31:10.870
stack.

00:31:10.870 --> 00:31:13.960
If you're on iOS it actually
has a full-blown interface

00:31:13.960 --> 00:31:16.850
to do OAuth 2.0 management
that's quite nice.

00:31:16.850 --> 00:31:19.410
It handles things
like network retries.

00:31:19.410 --> 00:31:22.110
It has local caching
for offline play.

00:31:22.110 --> 00:31:23.750
It has its own
built-in UI widgets.

00:31:23.750 --> 00:31:26.110
And it has a much, much
better threading model

00:31:26.110 --> 00:31:28.550
than even the standard
Play Games Services.

00:31:28.550 --> 00:31:30.280
You don't have to
worry about calling it

00:31:30.280 --> 00:31:31.865
from the main
thread, for example.

00:31:31.865 --> 00:31:33.495
It actually has its own threads.

00:31:33.495 --> 00:31:35.620
And of course you'll have
to worry about calling it

00:31:35.620 --> 00:31:38.600
from those other threads,
but at least it's

00:31:38.600 --> 00:31:42.810
not threadbound the way the
standard JNI version is,

00:31:42.810 --> 00:31:45.410
the standard Java version is.

00:31:45.410 --> 00:31:50.270
So what else would I
want to say about that?

00:31:50.270 --> 00:31:50.930
Yes.

00:31:50.930 --> 00:31:53.200
So version 1.0 of this,
all we're providing

00:31:53.200 --> 00:31:58.000
is sign in, leaderboards,
and achievements,

00:31:58.000 --> 00:32:00.790
which was supposed to the
third thing on that slide.

00:32:00.790 --> 00:32:02.920
So it's not for everyone.

00:32:02.920 --> 00:32:06.140
I recognize that this
is a work in progress.

00:32:06.140 --> 00:32:08.820
We're putting out there so
that people can start using it.

00:32:08.820 --> 00:32:10.530
We want to get your feedback.

00:32:10.530 --> 00:32:15.040
Did we do-- are we making the
right decisions with our C++

00:32:15.040 --> 00:32:17.270
native API for Play Games?

00:32:17.270 --> 00:32:20.784
So please, please let us know.

00:32:20.784 --> 00:32:23.200
We're really, really looking
for feedback on this product.

00:32:23.200 --> 00:32:25.440
We're going to be
expanding it going forward.

00:32:25.440 --> 00:32:27.320
I expect to see a
new version certainly

00:32:27.320 --> 00:32:30.794
in the Google I/O time frame
that does more and more stuff.

00:32:30.794 --> 00:32:32.460
But we're very, very
excited about this.

00:32:32.460 --> 00:32:34.376
We've put a lot of effort
in to make it great.

00:32:34.376 --> 00:32:38.870
And to make it really be
seamless and cross-platform.

00:32:38.870 --> 00:32:42.920
All right, let's do the
actual recap one more time.

00:32:42.920 --> 00:32:45.620
So once again, if you
missed it the first time,

00:32:45.620 --> 00:32:47.610
we find great users.

00:32:47.610 --> 00:32:50.330
We can appeal to
hardcore stereotypes

00:32:50.330 --> 00:32:51.560
for gaming archetypes.

00:32:51.560 --> 00:32:54.570
We also can appeal to
more casual archetypes.

00:32:54.570 --> 00:32:56.400
We have services
that do all of that.

00:32:56.400 --> 00:32:58.530
We actually help you
engage your users

00:32:58.530 --> 00:33:00.620
through social interactions.

00:33:00.620 --> 00:33:02.340
Consider doing everything
cross-platform,

00:33:02.340 --> 00:33:03.840
because it makes
your users happier.

00:33:03.840 --> 00:33:05.730
It's the right thing to do.

00:33:05.730 --> 00:33:08.150
Don't make my friends sad.

00:33:08.150 --> 00:33:10.720
And of course we added
these great statistics

00:33:10.720 --> 00:33:14.300
that you get for free, just
by integrating Play Games

00:33:14.300 --> 00:33:15.740
Services.

00:33:15.740 --> 00:33:16.700
All right?

00:33:16.700 --> 00:33:18.840
Oh yes, and we also
have Unity and C++.

00:33:18.840 --> 00:33:22.530
So you have to do
even less work.

00:33:22.530 --> 00:33:24.380
So that is my presentation.

00:33:24.380 --> 00:33:27.880
If you want to contact me, you
can contact me at +dangalpin,

00:33:27.880 --> 00:33:29.804
or Twitter @dagalpin.

00:33:29.804 --> 00:33:31.970
And I can now take some
questions for a few minutes,

00:33:31.970 --> 00:33:34.386
if you have any questions on
anything I just talked about.

00:33:34.386 --> 00:33:36.690
And I might even be able
to give you answers.

00:33:36.690 --> 00:33:40.726
And I'll repeat your questions
so that everyone else can hear.

00:33:40.726 --> 00:33:42.100
Oh, we're getting
you even a mic!

00:33:42.100 --> 00:33:43.290
This is so sophisticated.

00:33:43.290 --> 00:33:44.706
I love it.

00:33:44.706 --> 00:33:46.330
AUDIENCE: A really
simple one to start.

00:33:46.330 --> 00:33:49.110
How do you access
the statistics?

00:33:49.110 --> 00:33:51.000
DAN GALPIN: So the
statistics are actually

00:33:51.000 --> 00:33:53.760
available on the Google
Play publisher site,

00:33:53.760 --> 00:33:55.780
under the games tab.

00:33:55.780 --> 00:33:57.580
So it's actually under
the Play Games area.

00:34:01.388 --> 00:34:05.200
AUDIENCE: What are the options
for HTML5 game developers?

00:34:05.200 --> 00:34:07.360
DAN GALPIN: So for
HTML5 game developers,

00:34:07.360 --> 00:34:09.949
currently we support
leaderboards, achievements,

00:34:09.949 --> 00:34:11.789
sign in, and Cloud Save.

00:34:11.789 --> 00:34:13.830
And those are all supported
through standard REST

00:34:13.830 --> 00:34:15.370
endpoints.

00:34:15.370 --> 00:34:16.989
We're looking to
see what we can do

00:34:16.989 --> 00:34:19.280
to bring some of
the other services.

00:34:19.280 --> 00:34:21.154
Turn-based is kind
of partially there.

00:34:21.154 --> 00:34:22.820
Real-time we need to
do a bunch of work,

00:34:22.820 --> 00:34:24.530
because real-time
relies on a bunch

00:34:24.530 --> 00:34:28.790
of sophisticated networking
that we don't have really yet,

00:34:28.790 --> 00:34:31.139
in a standard way
across web browsers.

00:34:31.139 --> 00:34:34.908
But I think that we'll see
turn-based next, probably.

00:34:34.908 --> 00:34:36.949
It's still all about, how
do we get notifications

00:34:36.949 --> 00:34:38.259
in the best way to users?

00:34:38.259 --> 00:34:40.550
And making sure that experience
is really, really good.

00:34:40.550 --> 00:34:43.945
But we're very, very close
on turn-based actually.

00:34:43.945 --> 00:34:44.945
AUDIENCE: Over here now.

00:34:49.990 --> 00:34:51.739
DAN GALPIN: There's
two out there, I know.

00:34:51.739 --> 00:34:55.170
It's the blue one.

00:34:55.170 --> 00:34:58.410
AUDIENCE: We are in the
progress of integrating

00:34:58.410 --> 00:35:01.000
real-time multiplayer
in our game,

00:35:01.000 --> 00:35:03.305
and we have some pretty
detailed stuff, where

00:35:03.305 --> 00:35:06.190
we have some issues how
to solve some problems.

00:35:06.190 --> 00:35:09.360
And we're not sure whether
the API supports them.

00:35:09.360 --> 00:35:12.460
Where would you recommend
we go to find questions

00:35:12.460 --> 00:35:14.300
to such detailed questions?

00:35:14.300 --> 00:35:16.060
DAN GALPIN: So there's
kind of two things.

00:35:16.060 --> 00:35:20.290
One is that Stack Overflow is
actually our primary support

00:35:20.290 --> 00:35:21.820
site for Play Games Services.

00:35:21.820 --> 00:35:23.320
We actually have out own tag.

00:35:23.320 --> 00:35:26.370
So that's certainly a
great place to start.

00:35:26.370 --> 00:35:28.090
Obviously, you know
people at Google.

00:35:28.090 --> 00:35:30.001
You can also ask us.

00:35:30.001 --> 00:35:31.750
If Stack Overflow
doesn't have the answer,

00:35:31.750 --> 00:35:33.250
you can always ask
another question.

00:35:33.250 --> 00:35:36.330
We actually do try to monitor
that on a semi-regular basis

00:35:36.330 --> 00:35:37.030
as well.

00:35:37.030 --> 00:35:41.160
But since you know us, you can
certainly ask us as directly.

00:35:41.160 --> 00:35:45.150
While you're here, just
find one of us afterwards.

00:35:45.150 --> 00:35:48.330
AUDIENCE: That would mean,
if I make a question on Stack

00:35:48.330 --> 00:35:50.750
Overflow, and nobody
answers it, then I

00:35:50.750 --> 00:35:53.240
could send an email to
you and then you would--

00:35:53.240 --> 00:35:54.540
DAN GALPIN: You can actually
send it to both of us

00:35:54.540 --> 00:35:55.280
at the same time.

00:35:55.280 --> 00:35:56.000
That works, too.

00:35:56.000 --> 00:35:57.749
You could say, I just
posted this question

00:35:57.749 --> 00:35:59.640
on Stack Overflow, link.

00:35:59.640 --> 00:36:00.350
Can you help?

00:36:00.350 --> 00:36:04.760
And I'll make sure to send
it to someone on our team who

00:36:04.760 --> 00:36:06.967
might be able to
answer that question.

00:36:06.967 --> 00:36:08.550
But I really like
using Stack Overflow

00:36:08.550 --> 00:36:09.780
because I like
making sure that once

00:36:09.780 --> 00:36:12.040
we give out an answer, as
many people as possible

00:36:12.040 --> 00:36:13.289
can get access to that answer.

00:36:13.289 --> 00:36:15.139
So unless it's
something proprietary,

00:36:15.139 --> 00:36:16.180
it's be great to do that.

00:36:16.180 --> 00:36:17.221
To go through that route.

00:36:19.930 --> 00:36:22.420
AUDIENCE: I just wondered
what the economics are

00:36:22.420 --> 00:36:25.950
for using this new
cross-platform multiplayer.

00:36:25.950 --> 00:36:28.080
Like, how much
does that cost us?

00:36:28.080 --> 00:36:30.230
DAN GALPIN: All these
services are all free.

00:36:30.230 --> 00:36:33.190
They have generous quotas.

00:36:33.190 --> 00:36:36.289
If for some reason those
quotas aren't good enough,

00:36:36.289 --> 00:36:36.830
just tell us.

00:36:36.830 --> 00:36:38.050
We'll give you more quota.

00:36:38.050 --> 00:36:41.400
We just need to know why our
services are getting picked on.

00:36:41.400 --> 00:36:42.500
I didn't mention that.

00:36:42.500 --> 00:36:44.945
Yeah, like all this
stuff, we're providing

00:36:44.945 --> 00:36:46.320
all this infrastructure
for free.

00:36:46.320 --> 00:36:48.160
We want to actually
improve games.

00:36:48.160 --> 00:36:52.780
We see a lot of upside to games
being better and more engaging,

00:36:52.780 --> 00:36:55.010
with a stronger player pool.

00:36:55.010 --> 00:36:57.332
So that's why we're doing this.

00:36:57.332 --> 00:36:59.665
And we really, really feel
that the cross-platform story

00:36:59.665 --> 00:37:02.994
is very, very important
to our gamers.

00:37:02.994 --> 00:37:04.660
To the most important
people, the people

00:37:04.660 --> 00:37:08.237
who are actually playing games.

00:37:08.237 --> 00:37:09.070
Any other questions?

00:37:11.870 --> 00:37:15.780
AUDIENCE: How is Apple
is reacting to that?

00:37:15.780 --> 00:37:19.960
DAN GALPIN: You know, I don't
have any friends at Apple

00:37:19.960 --> 00:37:23.550
that have told me anything
negative about it.

00:37:23.550 --> 00:37:29.260
I think that we feel
that this kind of service

00:37:29.260 --> 00:37:31.250
is the best thing for users.

00:37:31.250 --> 00:37:33.580
And that's the
way we look at it.

00:37:33.580 --> 00:37:38.120
It's kind of a philosophy we
have at Google, in general way,

00:37:38.120 --> 00:37:40.350
is to put our users first.

00:37:40.350 --> 00:37:43.580
That's why we've gone to
such lengths to do this.

00:37:43.580 --> 00:37:45.330
I actually think we're
going to go farther

00:37:45.330 --> 00:37:47.735
in terms of cross-platform
support in the future.

00:37:47.735 --> 00:37:49.980
I mean, right now we
have again, REST APIs.

00:37:49.980 --> 00:37:51.350
That's pretty platform agnostic.

00:37:51.350 --> 00:37:54.075
I'd like to see us even do
one step better than that.

00:37:54.075 --> 00:37:56.200
So hopefully you'll see
more from us in the future.

00:37:56.200 --> 00:37:59.311
But again, this is all about
giving users what they want.

00:37:59.311 --> 00:38:01.310
Which is the ability to
play with their friends.

00:38:01.310 --> 00:38:04.350
And for me, the ability to
play on any device I choose.

00:38:04.350 --> 00:38:07.290
Whether or not it's an Android
device or an iOS device

00:38:07.290 --> 00:38:09.754
or even some other device
from another manufacturer.

00:38:09.754 --> 00:38:11.420
And there's no reason
you can't actually

00:38:11.420 --> 00:38:13.586
use these services anywhere
you have REST endpoints.

00:38:18.247 --> 00:38:19.080
RICHARD HYNDMAN: OK?

00:38:19.080 --> 00:38:19.910
DAN GALPIN: All right.

00:38:19.910 --> 00:38:20.840
RICHARD HYNDMAN: Thank
you very much, Dan Galpin.

00:38:20.840 --> 00:38:21.890
DAN GALPIN: Thank you.

00:38:21.890 --> 00:38:23.999
[APPLAUSE]
