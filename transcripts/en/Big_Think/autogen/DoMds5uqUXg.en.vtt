going to die out there die within the

00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:28.530
going to die out there die within the
 

00:00:28.530 --> 00:00:31.160
going to die out there die within the
first 24 to 48 hours this is an

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:31.170
first 24 to 48 hours this is an
 

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:33.650
first 24 to 48 hours this is an
interesting phenomenon because I get a
