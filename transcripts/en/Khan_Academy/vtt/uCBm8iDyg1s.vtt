00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:04.470
Let's divide 9,815
by 65, or figure out

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:07.950
how many times the
65 go into 9,815.

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:09.640
And I encourage you
to pause this video

00:00:09.640 --> 00:00:11.950
and try this on your own.

00:00:11.950 --> 00:00:21.557
So let me just rewrite this
as 9,815 divided by 65.

00:00:21.557 --> 00:00:23.390
And we write it this
way because it's easier

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:25.200
to manipulate the
numbers, kind of doing

00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:27.170
the standard process here.

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:29.180
And as we'll see,
whenever we divide

00:00:29.180 --> 00:00:31.289
by a number that has
more than one digit,

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:32.830
there's a little
bit of an art to it.

00:00:32.830 --> 00:00:34.660
And hopefully you'll
get an appreciation

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:36.822
for that art over the
course of this video.

00:00:36.822 --> 00:00:38.280
So first we could
think about well,

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:41.577
how many times
does 65 go into 9?

00:00:41.577 --> 00:00:43.160
Well it doesn't go
into 9 at all so we

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:44.760
can move one digit to the right.

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:49.200
How many times does it go
into 98 without going over it?

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:53.170
Well 65 times 1 is 65 so
that doesn't go over it.

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:55.920
And 65 times 2, well
that would be 130 so

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:57.540
that would go over 98.

00:00:57.540 --> 00:01:00.520
So it only goes one time.

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:04.819
We multiply 1 times
65, which is 65.

00:01:04.819 --> 00:01:08.210
And then we could subtract to
see how much we have left over.

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:13.760
So 8 minus 5 is 3
and 9 minus 6 is 3.

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:18.477
And now we can bring down
the next digit, this 1 here.

00:01:18.477 --> 00:01:20.060
And now this is where
the art is going

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:22.018
to come into play because
we need to figure out

00:01:22.018 --> 00:01:28.685
how many times does 65 go into
331 without going over it.

00:01:28.685 --> 00:01:31.020
And you might just try
to look at these numbers,

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:33.030
try to approximate
them a little bit.

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:36.950
You might say, well, maybe 65,
let me round this thing up.

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:38.730
Maybe this is close to 70.

00:01:38.730 --> 00:01:43.170
And let's see, this
is close to 300.

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:46.560
So maybe we say, well,
70 would go into 300.

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:50.760
So maybe we think about how
many times does 70 go into 300?

00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:52.330
And we say without
going over it,

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:53.980
it doesn't go exactly into 300.

00:01:53.980 --> 00:01:57.400
Well you could say, well how
many times does 7 go into 30?

00:01:57.400 --> 00:02:01.640
Well we know 7 goes
into 30 four times.

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:03.520
4 times 7 is 28.

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:06.010
So maybe try a 4 right
over here because then this

00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:08.777
will be 280, 4 times 70 is 280.

00:02:08.777 --> 00:02:10.860
You're still going to have
a little bit left over,

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:13.890
but what you have left over
is going to be less than 70.

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:15.520
It's going to be 20.

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:17.680
So you say, well, if
this is roughly 70

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:20.090
and if this is roughly
300, then maybe it's

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:21.410
going to be the same thing.

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:22.750
So let's try that out.

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:25.590
Let's see if it goes four times.

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:31.440
So 4 times 5 is 20, carry the 2.

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:35.810
4 times 6 is 24 plus 2 is 26.

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:38.070
And now let's see how
much we had left over.

00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:42.663
So when we subtract,
we are left with-- I'll

00:02:42.663 --> 00:02:46.260
do this in a new
color-- 1 minus 0 is 1.

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:47.980
We have a 3 here and
a 6 here so we're

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:49.080
going to have to do
a little regrouping.

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:50.960
Let's take 100 from
the hundreds place.

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:52.290
It becomes 200.

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:56.170
Give those 10 tens, that
100, to the tens place.

00:02:56.170 --> 00:02:58.030
So now we have 13 tens.

00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:02.540
13 minus 6 is 7 and
then 2 minus 2 is 1.

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:04.410
So did this work out?

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:07.270
Well no, our remainder, after
we said it went in four times,

00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:09.480
we actually had 71 left over.

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:13.717
71, this right over
here, is larger than 65.

00:03:13.717 --> 00:03:16.050
You don't want a situation
where what you have left over

00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:17.425
is larger than
what you're trying

00:03:17.425 --> 00:03:18.630
to divide into the number.

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:20.180
You could have gone
into it one more

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:23.980
time because you had
so much left over.

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:26.270
So this 4 was actually too low.

00:03:26.270 --> 00:03:28.900
We should have probably
approximated this as 60,

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:31.930
and 60 goes into 300,
if we were to estimate,

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:34.360
we'd say, well that might
be closer to five times.

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:37.230
So this is where the art
of this comes into play.

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:40.600
So it was very reasonable to
do what I just did, but it just

00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:43.680
turned out to not be the
right way to think about it.

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:45.640
I could just say, well
the 4 wasn't enough.

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:46.740
I had too much left over.

00:03:46.740 --> 00:03:49.050
Let me try 5 now.

00:03:49.050 --> 00:03:53.110
5 times 5 is 25, carry the 2.

00:03:53.110 --> 00:03:56.360
5 times 6 is 30, plus 2 is 32.

00:03:56.360 --> 00:03:56.930
There you go.

00:03:56.930 --> 00:04:00.390
We got much closer to
331 without going over.

00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:04.010
Now we can subtract.

00:04:04.010 --> 00:04:06.070
And once again, we could
do a little regrouping.

00:04:06.070 --> 00:04:07.860
Take a 10 from the tens place.

00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:09.240
This becomes two tens.

00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:11.270
This becomes an 11.

00:04:11.270 --> 00:04:15.460
11 minus 5 is 6, 2 minus
2 is 0, 3 minus 3 is 0.

00:04:15.460 --> 00:04:17.440
So we only have 6
left over, which

00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:19.370
is obviously less than 65.

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:20.640
So we're all good.

00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:24.070
And if we put a 6 here, we
would have gone over 331.

00:04:24.070 --> 00:04:26.460
And so that wouldn't
have been cool either.

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:29.480
But anyway, let's bring
down the next digit.

00:04:29.480 --> 00:04:31.260
Let's bring down the 5.

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:33.826
So how many times
does 65 go into 65?

00:04:33.826 --> 00:04:35.530
Well, it goes one time.

00:04:35.530 --> 00:04:36.920
1 times 65,-- OK.

00:04:36.920 --> 00:04:39.220
Ignore this, that's from
a previous step-- 1 times

00:04:39.220 --> 00:04:41.620
65 is 65.

00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:46.740
And then you subtract,
and we have no remainder.

00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:57.272
So we see that 65 goes into
9,815 exactly 150-- let me

00:04:57.272 --> 00:05:00.650
just that in that
same blue color,

00:05:00.650 --> 00:05:08.800
I don't want to do all these
arbitrary colors-- 151 times.
