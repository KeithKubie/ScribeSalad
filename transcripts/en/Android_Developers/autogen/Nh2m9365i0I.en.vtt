with me when I say that
 

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:15.680
with me when I say that
one of the important factors in why

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:15.690
one of the important factors in why
 

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:17.630
one of the important factors in why
growth or achieving sustainable growth

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:17.640
growth or achieving sustainable growth
 

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:20.750
growth or achieving sustainable growth
in the long run is so difficult is that

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:20.760
in the long run is so difficult is that
 

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:24.290
in the long run is so difficult is that
the individual tactics and tools and

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:24.300
the individual tactics and tools and
 

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:26.240
the individual tactics and tools and
techniques that people are using using

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:26.250
techniques that people are using using
 

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:28.850
techniques that people are using using
and not only complex in themselves but

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:28.860
and not only complex in themselves but
 

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:31.970
and not only complex in themselves but
importantly they're also very

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:31.980
importantly they're also very
 

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:35.180
importantly they're also very
interconnected and so it's tempting to

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:35.190
interconnected and so it's tempting to
 

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:38.740
interconnected and so it's tempting to
obsess about one or two or three

00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:38.750
obsess about one or two or three
 

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:41.900
obsess about one or two or three
individual tactics and master them but

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:41.910
individual tactics and master them but
 

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:44.180
individual tactics and master them but
kind of you know lose sight over the big

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:44.190
kind of you know lose sight over the big
 

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:48.230
kind of you know lose sight over the big
picture and so for example let's look at

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:48.240
picture and so for example let's look at
 

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:51.200
picture and so for example let's look at
performance marketing so there's a

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:51.210
performance marketing so there's a
 

00:02:51.210 --> 00:02:53.960
performance marketing so there's a
recent study that showed that marketers

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:53.970
recent study that showed that marketers
 

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:57.230
recent study that showed that marketers
are using dozens of channels and ad

00:02:57.230 --> 00:02:57.240
are using dozens of channels and ad
 

00:02:57.240 --> 00:03:01.640
are using dozens of channels and ad
formats to reach their users so this is

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:01.650
formats to reach their users so this is
 

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:05.240
formats to reach their users so this is
just looking at paid marketing and for

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:05.250
just looking at paid marketing and for
 

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:07.160
just looking at paid marketing and for
me that already looks like a very very

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:07.170
me that already looks like a very very
 

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:10.160
me that already looks like a very very
complicated subject to master so just

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:10.170
complicated subject to master so just
 

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:12.530
complicated subject to master so just
performance marketing but of course we

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:12.540
performance marketing but of course we
 

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:14.240
performance marketing but of course we
haven't even thought about or haven't

00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:14.250
haven't even thought about or haven't
 

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:17.090
haven't even thought about or haven't
even looked at all of the organic ways

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:17.100
even looked at all of the organic ways
 

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:21.250
even looked at all of the organic ways
of driving users to your app and the

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:21.260
of driving users to your app and the
 

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:26.030
of driving users to your app and the
interdependencies between those also for

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:26.040
interdependencies between those also for
 

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:27.890
interdependencies between those also for
acidly so when I think about growth

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:27.900
acidly so when I think about growth
 

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:30.740
acidly so when I think about growth
growth involves much much more than user

00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:30.750
growth involves much much more than user
 

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:35.900
growth involves much much more than user
acquisition so in fact I'm certain that

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:35.910
acquisition so in fact I'm certain that
 

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:38.240
acquisition so in fact I'm certain that
almost all of you here in the audience

00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:38.250
almost all of you here in the audience
 

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:41.390
almost all of you here in the audience
today are working on strategies to

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:41.400
today are working on strategies to
 

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:44.780
today are working on strategies to
better engage and retain users in fact

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:44.790
better engage and retain users in fact
 

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:47.750
better engage and retain users in fact
at a recent Play event earlier in the

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:47.760
at a recent Play event earlier in the
 

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:50.300
at a recent Play event earlier in the
year we did roundtable discussions and

00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:50.310
year we did roundtable discussions and
 

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:52.160
year we did roundtable discussions and
there developed almost every single

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:52.170
there developed almost every single
 

00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:54.860
there developed almost every single
person I talked to told me that they

00:03:54.860 --> 00:03:54.870
person I talked to told me that they
 

00:03:54.870 --> 00:03:57.320
person I talked to told me that they
obsess about the onboarding experience

00:03:57.320 --> 00:03:57.330
obsess about the onboarding experience
 

00:03:57.330 --> 00:04:00.290
obsess about the onboarding experience
in their app to make sure that people or

00:04:00.290 --> 00:04:00.300
in their app to make sure that people or
 

00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:02.990
in their app to make sure that people or
that new users sign up or activate push

00:04:02.990 --> 00:04:03.000
that new users sign up or activate push
 

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:05.660
that new users sign up or activate push
notifications to then later be able to

00:04:05.660 --> 00:04:05.670
notifications to then later be able to
 

00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:07.760
notifications to then later be able to
target them better with lifecycle

00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:07.770
target them better with lifecycle
 

00:04:07.770 --> 00:04:11.390
target them better with lifecycle
marketing campaigns now those are just

00:04:11.390 --> 00:04:11.400
marketing campaigns now those are just
 

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:14.300
marketing campaigns now those are just
two things so onboarding experienced a

00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:14.310
two things so onboarding experienced a
 

00:04:14.310 --> 00:04:16.460
two things so onboarding experienced a
first time user experience and life

00:04:16.460 --> 00:04:16.470
first time user experience and life
 

00:04:16.470 --> 00:04:18.979
first time user experience and life
cycle marketing but there a lot of other

00:04:18.979 --> 00:04:18.989
cycle marketing but there a lot of other
 

00:04:18.989 --> 00:04:21.500
cycle marketing but there a lot of other
things that people are doing to drive

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:21.510
things that people are doing to drive
 

00:04:21.510 --> 00:04:23.950
things that people are doing to drive
growth in engagement and retention

00:04:23.950 --> 00:04:23.960
growth in engagement and retention
 

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:27.310
growth in engagement and retention
ultimately usage of their app and of

00:04:27.310 --> 00:04:27.320
ultimately usage of their app and of
 

00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:30.760
ultimately usage of their app and of
course eventually all of us will care

00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:30.770
course eventually all of us will care
 

00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:34.210
course eventually all of us will care
about revenue and our growing revenue

00:04:34.210 --> 00:04:34.220
about revenue and our growing revenue
 

00:04:34.220 --> 00:04:36.760
about revenue and our growing revenue
but of course how much you focus on

00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:36.770
but of course how much you focus on
 

00:04:36.770 --> 00:04:38.350
but of course how much you focus on

optimizing or growing their revenue is
 

00:04:47.590 --> 00:04:50.950
optimizing or growing their revenue is
by optimizing their pricing strategy but

by optimizing their pricing strategy but
 

00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:53.170
by optimizing their pricing strategy but
it's much more than just deciding on a

00:04:53.170 --> 00:04:53.180
it's much more than just deciding on a
 

00:04:53.180 --> 00:04:56.230
it's much more than just deciding on a
price so developers like top developers

00:04:56.230 --> 00:04:56.240
price so developers like top developers
 

00:04:56.240 --> 00:04:58.060

like Netflix they're using a lot of very
 

00:04:58.070 --> 00:05:00.330
like Netflix they're using a lot of very
subtle strategies and they're

00:05:00.330 --> 00:05:00.340
subtle strategies and they're
 

00:05:00.340 --> 00:05:02.920
subtle strategies and they're
experimenting with things like a price

00:05:02.920 --> 00:05:02.930

about growing revenue you know you have
 

00:05:17.660 --> 00:05:19.719
about growing revenue you know you have
to think about how do you capture value

on stage later Andy and a couple of

00:06:16.300 --> 00:06:16.310
on stage later Andy and a couple of
 

00:06:16.310 --> 00:06:18.010
on stage later Andy and a couple of
people around him in the growth hacking

00:06:18.010 --> 00:06:18.020
people around him in the growth hacking
 

00:06:18.020 --> 00:06:20.379
people around him in the growth hacking
community have been thinking a lot about

00:06:20.379 --> 00:06:20.389
community have been thinking a lot about
 

00:06:20.389 --> 00:06:22.870
community have been thinking a lot about
one of these tools to structure growth

00:06:22.870 --> 00:06:22.880
one of these tools to structure growth
 

00:06:22.880 --> 00:06:25.300
one of these tools to structure growth
and I want to give you a very brief

00:06:25.300 --> 00:06:25.310
and I want to give you a very brief
 

00:06:25.310 --> 00:06:28.270
and I want to give you a very brief
introduction to a growth hacking

00:06:28.270 --> 00:06:28.280
introduction to a growth hacking
 

00:06:28.280 --> 00:06:32.409
introduction to a growth hacking
framework so the first thing that you

00:06:32.409 --> 00:06:32.419
framework so the first thing that you
 

00:06:32.419 --> 00:06:34.600
framework so the first thing that you
should do is actually to stake to take a

00:06:34.600 --> 00:06:34.610
should do is actually to stake to take a
 

00:06:34.610 --> 00:06:37.989
should do is actually to stake to take a
step back and so just

00:06:37.989 --> 00:06:37.999
step back and so just
 

00:06:37.999 --> 00:06:39.759
step back and so just
before looking at any of the tools

00:06:39.759 --> 00:06:39.769
before looking at any of the tools
 

00:06:39.769 --> 00:06:42.519
before looking at any of the tools
tactics and techniques think about your

00:06:42.519 --> 00:06:42.529
tactics and techniques think about your
 

00:06:42.529 --> 00:06:44.469
tactics and techniques think about your
high-level business objectives whatever

00:06:44.469 --> 00:06:44.479
high-level business objectives whatever
 

00:06:44.479 --> 00:06:46.389
high-level business objectives whatever
they are so if you're early in your in

00:06:46.389 --> 00:06:46.399
they are so if you're early in your in
 

00:06:46.399 --> 00:06:48.539
they are so if you're early in your in
your venture maybe you're just trying to

00:06:48.539 --> 00:06:48.549
your venture maybe you're just trying to
 

00:06:48.549 --> 00:06:52.329
your venture maybe you're just trying to
validate a minimum and viable product or

00:06:52.329 --> 00:06:52.339
validate a minimum and viable product or
 

00:06:52.339 --> 00:06:55.029
validate a minimum and viable product or
you're trying to double sales on mobile

00:06:55.029 --> 00:06:55.039
you're trying to double sales on mobile
 

00:06:55.039 --> 00:06:57.129
you're trying to double sales on mobile
or you're you know maybe looking for

00:06:57.129 --> 00:06:57.139
or you're you know maybe looking for
 

00:06:57.139 --> 00:06:59.319
or you're you know maybe looking for
investment and you want to raise a round

00:06:59.319 --> 00:06:59.329
investment and you want to raise a round
 

00:06:59.329 --> 00:07:04.209
investment and you want to raise a round
of investment now think about how those

00:07:04.209 --> 00:07:04.219
of investment now think about how those
 

00:07:04.219 --> 00:07:08.259
of investment now think about how those
high-level business objectives what do

00:07:08.259 --> 00:07:08.269
high-level business objectives what do
 

00:07:08.269 --> 00:07:11.649
high-level business objectives what do
they mean for your growth strategy for

00:07:11.649 --> 00:07:11.659
they mean for your growth strategy for
 

00:07:11.659 --> 00:07:14.279
they mean for your growth strategy for
how you define growth for yourself and

00:07:14.279 --> 00:07:14.289
how you define growth for yourself and
 

00:07:14.289 --> 00:07:17.439
how you define growth for yourself and
you will start to notice that you're

00:07:17.439 --> 00:07:17.449
you will start to notice that you're
 

00:07:17.449 --> 00:07:20.139
you will start to notice that you're
probably without looking at anything

00:07:20.139 --> 00:07:20.149
probably without looking at anything
 

00:07:20.149 --> 00:07:22.749
probably without looking at anything
individual you probably be interested to

00:07:22.749 --> 00:07:22.759
individual you probably be interested to
 

00:07:22.759 --> 00:07:25.600
individual you probably be interested to
focus more strongly on one of these

00:07:25.600 --> 00:07:25.610
focus more strongly on one of these
 

00:07:25.610 --> 00:07:26.319
focus more strongly on one of these
three things

00:07:26.319 --> 00:07:26.329
three things
 

00:07:26.329 --> 00:07:29.649
three things
maybe you'll focus on all but it will

00:07:29.649 --> 00:07:29.659
maybe you'll focus on all but it will
 

00:07:29.659 --> 00:07:32.079
maybe you'll focus on all but it will
sort of give you an initial idea on

00:07:32.079 --> 00:07:32.089
sort of give you an initial idea on
 

00:07:32.089 --> 00:07:34.899
sort of give you an initial idea on
where you might want to where you might

00:07:34.899 --> 00:07:34.909
where you might want to where you might
 

00:07:34.909 --> 00:07:38.229
where you might want to where you might
want to focus also of course important

00:07:38.229 --> 00:07:38.239
want to focus also of course important
 

00:07:38.239 --> 00:07:40.029
want to focus also of course important
not just your business objectives but

00:07:40.029 --> 00:07:40.039
not just your business objectives but
 

00:07:40.039 --> 00:07:41.919
not just your business objectives but
also your resources and your gun strains

00:07:41.919 --> 00:07:41.929
also your resources and your gun strains
 

00:07:41.929 --> 00:07:43.269
also your resources and your gun strains
and I'll think about that a little bit

00:07:43.269 --> 00:07:43.279
and I'll think about that a little bit
 

00:07:43.279 --> 00:07:45.249
and I'll think about that a little bit
I'll talk about that a little bit later

00:07:45.249 --> 00:07:45.259
I'll talk about that a little bit later
 

00:07:45.259 --> 00:07:50.319
I'll talk about that a little bit later
on so let's talk about how to apply that

00:07:50.319 --> 00:07:50.329
on so let's talk about how to apply that
 

00:07:50.329 --> 00:07:55.239
on so let's talk about how to apply that
so tactics all the things I mentioned

00:07:55.239 --> 00:07:55.249
so tactics all the things I mentioned
 

00:07:55.249 --> 00:07:59.259
so tactics all the things I mentioned
earlier are you kind of tools tactics

00:07:59.259 --> 00:07:59.269
earlier are you kind of tools tactics
 

00:07:59.269 --> 00:08:01.359
earlier are you kind of tools tactics
strategies that are available for you

00:08:01.359 --> 00:08:01.369
strategies that are available for you
 

00:08:01.369 --> 00:08:04.179
strategies that are available for you
that to you so when you and these this

00:08:04.179 --> 00:08:04.189
that to you so when you and these this
 

00:08:04.189 --> 00:08:06.459
that to you so when you and these this
by the way is not an exhaustive list

00:08:06.459 --> 00:08:06.469
by the way is not an exhaustive list
 

00:08:06.469 --> 00:08:08.229
by the way is not an exhaustive list
there many many other things that people

00:08:08.229 --> 00:08:08.239
there many many other things that people
 

00:08:08.239 --> 00:08:11.350
there many many other things that people
are doing but when you're evaluating an

00:08:11.350 --> 00:08:11.360
are doing but when you're evaluating an
 

00:08:11.360 --> 00:08:13.809
are doing but when you're evaluating an
activity think about how does this

00:08:13.809 --> 00:08:13.819
activity think about how does this
 

00:08:13.819 --> 00:08:16.629
activity think about how does this
particular activity fit into my overall

00:08:16.629 --> 00:08:16.639
particular activity fit into my overall
 

00:08:16.639 --> 00:08:21.149
particular activity fit into my overall
strategy so you can do that for the

00:08:21.149 --> 00:08:21.159
strategy so you can do that for the
 

00:08:21.159 --> 00:08:24.129
strategy so you can do that for the
activities that foster user acquisition

00:08:24.129 --> 00:08:24.139
activities that foster user acquisition
 

00:08:24.139 --> 00:08:27.069
activities that foster user acquisition
or accelerate user acquisition you can

00:08:27.069 --> 00:08:27.079
or accelerate user acquisition you can
 

00:08:27.079 --> 00:08:29.679
or accelerate user acquisition you can
do that for activities that increase

00:08:29.679 --> 00:08:29.689
do that for activities that increase
 

00:08:29.689 --> 00:08:33.100
do that for activities that increase
engagement and retention and you can do

00:08:33.100 --> 00:08:33.110
engagement and retention and you can do
 

00:08:33.110 --> 00:08:35.679
engagement and retention and you can do
that for growing revenue and I'm not

00:08:35.679 --> 00:08:35.689
that for growing revenue and I'm not
 

00:08:35.689 --> 00:08:37.600
that for growing revenue and I'm not
saying you should be doing all of these

00:08:37.600 --> 00:08:37.610
saying you should be doing all of these
 

00:08:37.610 --> 00:08:39.699
saying you should be doing all of these
things you should be looking at every

00:08:39.699 --> 00:08:39.709
things you should be looking at every
 

00:08:39.709 --> 00:08:41.889
things you should be looking at every
single tactic in light of your overall

00:08:41.889 --> 00:08:41.899
single tactic in light of your overall
 

00:08:41.899 --> 00:08:45.040
single tactic in light of your overall
objectives your resources and maybe your

00:08:45.040 --> 00:08:45.050
objectives your resources and maybe your
 

00:08:45.050 --> 00:08:48.249
objectives your resources and maybe your
constraints but then once you have sort

00:08:48.249 --> 00:08:48.259
constraints but then once you have sort
 

00:08:48.259 --> 00:08:50.679
constraints but then once you have sort
of assembled your toolset for growth

00:08:50.679 --> 00:08:50.689
of assembled your toolset for growth
 

00:08:50.689 --> 00:08:52.090
of assembled your toolset for growth
there's another

00:08:52.090 --> 00:08:52.100
there's another
 

00:08:52.100 --> 00:08:54.780
there's another
thing that you need to do and that is

little play listing experiments to
 

00:12:33.840 --> 00:12:36.800
little play listing experiments to
increase the conversion rate and over

00:12:36.800 --> 00:12:36.810
increase the conversion rate and over
 

00:12:36.810 --> 00:12:38.780
increase the conversion rate and over
the course of about six months they

00:12:38.780 --> 00:12:38.790
the course of about six months they
 

00:12:38.790 --> 00:12:41.470
the course of about six months they
increased the conversion rate by 24% and

00:12:41.470 --> 00:12:41.480
increased the conversion rate by 24% and
 

00:12:41.480 --> 00:12:45.830
increased the conversion rate by 24% and
that's huge so that means that 24% more

00:12:45.830 --> 00:12:45.840
that's huge so that means that 24% more

the left one on your left okay so that's
 

00:13:16.440 --> 00:13:19.129
the left one on your left okay so that's
the black one okay and the others

00:13:19.129 --> 00:13:19.139
the black one okay and the others
 

00:13:19.139 --> 00:13:21.109
the black one okay and the others
okay yeah so the white one there's

00:13:21.109 --> 00:13:21.119
okay yeah so the white one there's
 

00:13:21.119 --> 00:13:22.970
okay yeah so the white one there's
actually two factors there that got

00:13:22.970 --> 00:13:22.980
actually two factors there that got
 

00:13:22.980 --> 00:13:26.059
actually two factors there that got
tested individually and the white phone

00:13:26.059 --> 00:13:26.069
tested individually and the white phone
 

00:13:26.069 --> 00:13:29.299
tested individually and the white phone
was much more and drove drove a higher

00:13:29.299 --> 00:13:29.309
was much more and drove drove a higher
 

00:13:29.309 --> 00:13:31.729
was much more and drove drove a higher
conversion rate and the larger image so

00:13:31.729 --> 00:13:31.739
conversion rate and the larger image so
 

00:13:31.739 --> 00:13:33.710
conversion rate and the larger image so
that's a really really cool and cool

00:13:33.710 --> 00:13:33.720
that's a really really cool and cool
 

00:13:33.720 --> 00:13:39.199
that's a really really cool and cool
inside here the next thing I want to

00:13:39.199 --> 00:13:39.209
inside here the next thing I want to
 

00:13:39.209 --> 00:13:40.699
inside here the next thing I want to
talk about in terms of the tool sets

00:13:40.699 --> 00:13:40.709
talk about in terms of the tool sets
 

00:13:40.709 --> 00:13:43.939
talk about in terms of the tool sets
that you have available is an example

00:13:43.939 --> 00:13:43.949
that you have available is an example
 

00:13:43.949 --> 00:13:45.859
that you have available is an example
from a non-profit which is share the

00:13:45.859 --> 00:13:45.869
from a non-profit which is share the
 

00:13:45.869 --> 00:13:49.249
from a non-profit which is share the
meal also based here in Berlin and these

00:13:49.249 --> 00:13:49.259
meal also based here in Berlin and these
 

00:13:49.259 --> 00:13:51.590
meal also based here in Berlin and these
guys I'm sure also did a very

00:13:51.590 --> 00:13:51.600
guys I'm sure also did a very
 

00:13:51.600 --> 00:13:54.229
guys I'm sure also did a very
sophisticated growth analysis but one of

00:13:54.229 --> 00:13:54.239
sophisticated growth analysis but one of
 

00:13:54.239 --> 00:13:56.599
sophisticated growth analysis but one of
the restrictions that they have is that

00:13:56.599 --> 00:13:56.609
the restrictions that they have is that
 

00:13:56.609 --> 00:13:58.340
the restrictions that they have is that
there are nonprofit so they can't

00:13:58.340 --> 00:13:58.350
there are nonprofit so they can't
 

00:13:58.350 --> 00:14:00.549
there are nonprofit so they can't
actually spend any money on advertising

00:14:00.549 --> 00:14:00.559
actually spend any money on advertising
 

00:14:00.559 --> 00:14:04.340
actually spend any money on advertising
so they sort of evaluated their

00:14:04.340 --> 00:14:04.350
so they sort of evaluated their
 

00:14:04.350 --> 00:14:06.619
so they sort of evaluated their
constraints and then third well one of

00:14:06.619 --> 00:14:06.629
constraints and then third well one of
 

00:14:06.629 --> 00:14:08.269
constraints and then third well one of
the things we can do and we can do very

00:14:08.269 --> 00:14:08.279
the things we can do and we can do very
 

00:14:08.279 --> 00:14:10.579
the things we can do and we can do very
well as public relations and I think

00:14:10.579 --> 00:14:10.589
well as public relations and I think
 

00:14:10.589 --> 00:14:13.280
well as public relations and I think
it's a tool that's often overlooked

00:14:13.280 --> 00:14:13.290
it's a tool that's often overlooked
 

00:14:13.290 --> 00:14:15.379
it's a tool that's often overlooked
because it's hard to do well but when

00:14:15.379 --> 00:14:15.389
because it's hard to do well but when
 

00:14:15.389 --> 00:14:17.419
because it's hard to do well but when
you do it well it can be very very

00:14:17.419 --> 00:14:17.429
you do it well it can be very very
 

00:14:17.429 --> 00:14:21.109
you do it well it can be very very
powerful so they it's also hard to track

00:14:21.109 --> 00:14:21.119
powerful so they it's also hard to track
 

00:14:21.119 --> 00:14:23.359
powerful so they it's also hard to track
but they they have to track the impact

00:14:23.359 --> 00:14:23.369
but they they have to track the impact
 

00:14:23.369 --> 00:14:25.999
but they they have to track the impact
so they estimate about 50% of all so

00:14:25.999 --> 00:14:26.009
so they estimate about 50% of all so
 

00:14:26.009 --> 00:14:28.789
so they estimate about 50% of all so
total installs and we're driven by

00:14:28.789 --> 00:14:28.799
total installs and we're driven by
 

00:14:28.799 --> 00:14:32.689
total installs and we're driven by
public relations and a couple of the the

00:14:32.689 --> 00:14:32.699
public relations and a couple of the the
 

00:14:32.699 --> 00:14:34.400
public relations and a couple of the the
insights there is you need to really

00:14:34.400 --> 00:14:34.410
insights there is you need to really
 

00:14:34.410 --> 00:14:36.470
insights there is you need to really
focus on excellent messaging and having

00:14:36.470 --> 00:14:36.480
focus on excellent messaging and having
 

00:14:36.480 --> 00:14:39.650
focus on excellent messaging and having
the right hooks and also to combine

00:14:39.650 --> 00:14:39.660
the right hooks and also to combine
 

00:14:39.660 --> 00:14:41.720
the right hooks and also to combine
public relations with other initiatives

00:14:41.720 --> 00:14:41.730
public relations with other initiatives
 

00:14:41.730 --> 00:14:46.669
public relations with other initiatives
such as partnerships work or maybe fresh

00:14:46.669 --> 00:14:46.679
such as partnerships work or maybe fresh
 

00:14:46.679 --> 00:14:50.150
such as partnerships work or maybe fresh
press work partnerships and maybe viral

00:14:50.150 --> 00:14:50.160
press work partnerships and maybe viral
 

00:14:50.160 --> 00:14:53.809
press work partnerships and maybe viral
hooks something like that I also want to

00:14:53.809 --> 00:14:53.819
hooks something like that I also want to
 

00:14:53.819 --> 00:14:57.669
hooks something like that I also want to
talk a little bit about a virality so um

00:14:57.669 --> 00:14:57.679
talk a little bit about a virality so um
 

00:14:57.679 --> 00:15:00.319
talk a little bit about a virality so um
I'm sure you guys all know dubsmash I

00:15:00.319 --> 00:15:00.329
I'm sure you guys all know dubsmash I
 

00:15:00.329 --> 00:15:01.729
I'm sure you guys all know dubsmash I
don't know if anyone from dubsmash is

00:15:01.729 --> 00:15:01.739
don't know if anyone from dubsmash is
 

00:15:01.739 --> 00:15:06.439
don't know if anyone from dubsmash is
here today I think so no and maybe you

00:15:06.439 --> 00:15:06.449
here today I think so no and maybe you
 

00:15:06.449 --> 00:15:08.329
here today I think so no and maybe you
don't want to you don't want to say and

00:15:08.329 --> 00:15:08.339
don't want to you don't want to say and
 

00:15:08.339 --> 00:15:12.319
don't want to you don't want to say and
so dubsmash is a social video messaging

00:15:12.319 --> 00:15:12.329
so dubsmash is a social video messaging
 

00:15:12.329 --> 00:15:14.900
so dubsmash is a social video messaging
platform and basically what it does it

00:15:14.900 --> 00:15:14.910
platform and basically what it does it
 

00:15:14.910 --> 00:15:17.029
platform and basically what it does it
it allows you to create videos of

00:15:17.029 --> 00:15:17.039
it allows you to create videos of
 

00:15:17.039 --> 00:15:19.369
it allows you to create videos of
yourself that are dubbed and you can

00:15:19.369 --> 00:15:19.379
yourself that are dubbed and you can
 

00:15:19.379 --> 00:15:22.009
yourself that are dubbed and you can
lip-sync two songs and this is really

00:15:22.009 --> 00:15:22.019
lip-sync two songs and this is really
 

00:15:22.019 --> 00:15:25.909
lip-sync two songs and this is really
really fun and in a waver ality is built

00:15:25.909 --> 00:15:25.919
really fun and in a waver ality is built
 

00:15:25.919 --> 00:15:28.159
really fun and in a waver ality is built
into the product right it's it's not

00:15:28.159 --> 00:15:28.169
into the product right it's it's not
 

00:15:28.169 --> 00:15:30.169
into the product right it's it's not
very fun looking at your own at yourself

00:15:30.169 --> 00:15:30.179
very fun looking at your own at yourself
 

00:15:30.179 --> 00:15:32.419
very fun looking at your own at yourself
singing along to songs so you kind of

00:15:32.419 --> 00:15:32.429
singing along to songs so you kind of
 

00:15:32.429 --> 00:15:32.930
singing along to songs so you kind of
you know

00:15:32.930 --> 00:15:32.940
you know
 

00:15:32.940 --> 00:15:34.700
you know
sharing and reaching other users is

00:15:34.700 --> 00:15:34.710
sharing and reaching other users is
 

00:15:34.710 --> 00:15:37.370
sharing and reaching other users is
built-in and it has been hugely

00:15:37.370 --> 00:15:37.380
built-in and it has been hugely
 

00:15:37.380 --> 00:15:38.600
built-in and it has been hugely
successful and growth has been

00:15:38.600 --> 00:15:38.610
successful and growth has been
 

00:15:38.610 --> 00:15:41.510
successful and growth has been
phenomenal but the point I want to make

00:15:41.510 --> 00:15:41.520
phenomenal but the point I want to make
 

00:15:41.520 --> 00:15:45.500
phenomenal but the point I want to make
is that even if virality isn't built

00:15:45.500 --> 00:15:45.510
is that even if virality isn't built
 

00:15:45.510 --> 00:15:47.300
is that even if virality isn't built
into your product so if your product

00:15:47.300 --> 00:15:47.310
into your product so if your product
 

00:15:47.310 --> 00:15:49.520
into your product so if your product
isn't the perfect fit for viral

00:15:49.520 --> 00:15:49.530
isn't the perfect fit for viral
 

00:15:49.530 --> 00:15:52.130
isn't the perfect fit for viral
mechanics and there is a couple of

00:15:52.130 --> 00:15:52.140
mechanics and there is a couple of
 

00:15:52.140 --> 00:15:54.380
mechanics and there is a couple of
things that you can look out for to make

00:15:54.380 --> 00:15:54.390
things that you can look out for to make
 

00:15:54.390 --> 00:15:57.680
things that you can look out for to make
sure that and you make sharing as easy

00:15:57.680 --> 00:15:57.690
sure that and you make sharing as easy
 

00:15:57.690 --> 00:15:59.660
sure that and you make sharing as easy
as possible so there are really two

00:15:59.660 --> 00:15:59.670
as possible so there are really two
 

00:15:59.670 --> 00:16:02.570
as possible so there are really two
factors one is called it has a very fun

00:16:02.570 --> 00:16:02.580
factors one is called it has a very fun
 

00:16:02.580 --> 00:16:05.030
factors one is called it has a very fun
name it's called the K factor and it

00:16:05.030 --> 00:16:05.040
name it's called the K factor and it
 

00:16:05.040 --> 00:16:08.060
name it's called the K factor and it
basically means it describes how many

00:16:08.060 --> 00:16:08.070
basically means it describes how many
 

00:16:08.070 --> 00:16:11.180
basically means it describes how many
new users does one user bring into the

00:16:11.180 --> 00:16:11.190
new users does one user bring into the
 

00:16:11.190 --> 00:16:13.190
new users does one user bring into the
app so that's something that you might

00:16:13.190 --> 00:16:13.200
app so that's something that you might
 

00:16:13.200 --> 00:16:16.100
app so that's something that you might
want to that you might want to work on

00:16:16.100 --> 00:16:16.110
want to that you might want to work on
 

00:16:16.110 --> 00:16:18.290
want to that you might want to work on
improving by making it easier to share

00:16:18.290 --> 00:16:18.300
improving by making it easier to share
 

00:16:18.300 --> 00:16:21.230
improving by making it easier to share
and with other users so that can have a

00:16:21.230 --> 00:16:21.240
and with other users so that can have a
 

00:16:21.240 --> 00:16:23.180
and with other users so that can have a
really nice impact on your sort of

00:16:23.180 --> 00:16:23.190
really nice impact on your sort of
 

00:16:23.190 --> 00:16:26.180
really nice impact on your sort of
organic growth another factor that you

00:16:26.180 --> 00:16:26.190
organic growth another factor that you
 

00:16:26.190 --> 00:16:28.850
organic growth another factor that you
might want to look at is the cycle time

00:16:28.850 --> 00:16:28.860
might want to look at is the cycle time
 

00:16:28.860 --> 00:16:32.210
might want to look at is the cycle time
and that just means how short or how

00:16:32.210 --> 00:16:32.220
and that just means how short or how
 

00:16:32.220 --> 00:16:34.820
and that just means how short or how
long is the interval between me sharing

00:16:34.820 --> 00:16:34.830
long is the interval between me sharing
 

00:16:34.830 --> 00:16:36.770
long is the interval between me sharing
with friends and those friends coming

00:16:36.770 --> 00:16:36.780
with friends and those friends coming
 

00:16:36.780 --> 00:16:38.690
with friends and those friends coming
back to the app or installing the app

00:16:38.690 --> 00:16:38.700
back to the app or installing the app
 

00:16:38.700 --> 00:16:40.130
back to the app or installing the app
for the first time and then sharing

00:16:40.130 --> 00:16:40.140
for the first time and then sharing
 

00:16:40.140 --> 00:16:43.100
for the first time and then sharing
again so shortening that time can also

00:16:43.100 --> 00:16:43.110
again so shortening that time can also
 

00:16:43.110 --> 00:16:46.130
again so shortening that time can also
be a very very very powerful factor of

00:16:46.130 --> 00:16:46.140
be a very very very powerful factor of
 

00:16:46.140 --> 00:16:48.380
be a very very very powerful factor of
increasing the viral growth of your app

00:16:48.380 --> 00:16:48.390
increasing the viral growth of your app
 

00:16:48.390 --> 00:16:50.590
increasing the viral growth of your app
so think about making sharing easy

00:16:50.590 --> 00:16:50.600
so think about making sharing easy
 

00:16:50.600 --> 00:16:53.120
so think about making sharing easy
accessible and encouraging and

00:16:53.120 --> 00:16:53.130
accessible and encouraging and
 

00:16:53.130 --> 00:16:58.730

principles at runtastic so one of the
 

00:29:58.010 --> 00:30:00.190

encapsulated in these principles and
 

00:30:12.050 --> 00:30:13.980
encapsulated in these principles and
these principles then inform all the

00:30:13.980 --> 00:30:13.990
these principles then inform all the
 

00:30:13.990 --> 00:30:17.740
these principles then inform all the

their app so and I think it and it

00:30:40.660 --> 00:30:40.670
their app so and I think it and it
 

00:30:40.670 --> 00:30:42.850
their app so and I think it and it
encapsulates well the principles at work

00:30:42.850 --> 00:30:42.860
encapsulates well the principles at work
 

00:30:42.860 --> 00:30:46.690
encapsulates well the principles at work
so it applies data but it doesn't rely

00:30:46.690 --> 00:30:46.700
so it applies data but it doesn't rely
 

00:30:46.700 --> 00:30:49.180
so it applies data but it doesn't rely
on data and entirely the feedback is

00:30:49.180 --> 00:30:49.190
on data and entirely the feedback is
 

00:30:49.190 --> 00:30:52.480
on data and entirely the feedback is
also qualitative and it also means that

00:30:52.480 --> 00:30:52.490
also qualitative and it also means that
 

00:30:52.490 --> 00:30:53.950
also qualitative and it also means that
growth has never done so you have these

00:30:53.950 --> 00:30:53.960
growth has never done so you have these
 

00:30:53.960 --> 00:30:55.990
growth has never done so you have these
continuous feedback loops of how they do

00:30:55.990 --> 00:30:56.000
continuous feedback loops of how they do
 

00:30:56.000 --> 00:30:57.220
continuous feedback loops of how they do

another key thing I think that that you

00:31:00.279 --> 00:31:00.289
another key thing I think that that you
 

00:31:00.289 --> 00:31:01.659
another key thing I think that that you
need to remind yourself is is that

00:31:01.659 --> 00:31:01.669
need to remind yourself is is that
 

00:31:01.669 --> 00:31:04.629
need to remind yourself is is that
growth strategy is very cross-functional

00:31:04.629 --> 00:31:04.639
growth strategy is very cross-functional
 

00:31:04.639 --> 00:31:07.149
growth strategy is very cross-functional
it's a cross-functional endeavor and so

00:31:07.149 --> 00:31:07.159
it's a cross-functional endeavor and so
 

00:31:07.159 --> 00:31:09.460
it's a cross-functional endeavor and so

00:31:09.470 --> 00:31:12.220
the quality of your execution will
depend on assembling the right skill set

00:31:12.220 --> 00:31:12.230
depend on assembling the right skill set
 

00:31:12.230 --> 00:31:14.669
depend on assembling the right skill set
and the right people in your team to

on and II just want to give you a very
 

00:32:11.149 --> 00:32:14.649
on and II just want to give you a very
quick summary so first we looked at how

00:32:14.649 --> 00:32:14.659
quick summary so first we looked at how
 

00:32:14.659 --> 00:32:17.139
quick summary so first we looked at how
complex the whole topic of growth is but

00:32:17.139 --> 00:32:17.149
complex the whole topic of growth is but
 

00:32:17.149 --> 00:32:19.450
complex the whole topic of growth is but
then we likely introduced a very simple

00:32:19.450 --> 00:32:19.460
then we likely introduced a very simple
 

00:32:19.460 --> 00:32:22.509
then we likely introduced a very simple
tool the growth framework to deal with

tool the growth framework to deal with
 

00:32:22.519 --> 00:32:24.730
tool the growth framework to deal with
this and the first step is to look at

00:32:24.730 --> 00:32:24.740
this and the first step is to look at
 

00:32:24.740 --> 00:32:26.440
this and the first step is to look at
your high-level business objectives to

00:32:26.440 --> 00:32:26.450
your high-level business objectives to
 

00:32:26.450 --> 00:32:28.690
your high-level business objectives to
define what growth means to you for you

going to talk about a little bit today
and tell you why I think it's the the

00:34:19.320 --> 00:34:19.330
and tell you why I think it's the the
 

00:34:19.330 --> 00:34:22.770
and tell you why I think it's the the
most important growth metric and just

00:34:22.770 --> 00:34:22.780
most important growth metric and just
 

00:34:22.780 --> 00:34:24.060
most important growth metric and just
give you a little bit of insight into

00:34:24.060 --> 00:34:24.070
give you a little bit of insight into
 

00:34:24.070 --> 00:34:26.669
give you a little bit of insight into
like some of the things that we we did

00:34:26.669 --> 00:34:26.679
like some of the things that we we did

at SoundCloud to to increase retention
 

00:34:30.270 --> 00:34:36.030
at SoundCloud to to increase retention
so retention it's really scary when you

look at this graph on the right this is
the graph that I often refer to it was

00:34:40.320 --> 00:34:40.330
the graph that I often refer to it was

like apps in the top 10 and what you see
 

00:34:57.040 --> 00:35:01.070
like apps in the top 10 and what you see
on this curve is that even a top 10 app

00:35:01.070 --> 00:35:01.080
on this curve is that even a top 10 app
 

00:35:01.080 --> 00:35:04.530
on this curve is that even a top 10 app

ten it's it's likely to be retaining
 

00:35:09.369 --> 00:35:10.920

users significantly poorer than that
 

00:35:10.930 --> 00:35:13.410

it's it's a really tough game to retain

00:35:13.410 --> 00:35:13.420
it's it's a really tough game to retain
 

00:35:13.420 --> 00:35:16.920
it's it's a really tough game to retain

00:35:25.510 --> 00:35:28.650
it's a constant challenge to keep your
users engaged and retained and of course

00:35:28.650 --> 00:35:28.660
users engaged and retained and of course
 

00:35:28.660 --> 00:35:30.000
users engaged and retained and of course
if you're spending money on marketing

00:35:30.000 --> 00:35:30.010
if you're spending money on marketing
 

00:35:30.010 --> 00:35:32.040
if you're spending money on marketing
it's it's really scary to think that

00:35:32.040 --> 00:35:32.050
it's it's really scary to think that
 

00:35:32.050 --> 00:35:34.320
it's it's really scary to think that
actually you're paying to acquire users

00:35:34.320 --> 00:35:34.330
actually you're paying to acquire users
 

00:35:34.330 --> 00:35:35.550
actually you're paying to acquire users
who are probably not going to stick

00:35:35.550 --> 00:35:35.560
who are probably not going to stick
 

00:35:35.560 --> 00:35:38.340
who are probably not going to stick
around so anything you can do to improve

00:35:38.340 --> 00:35:38.350
around so anything you can do to improve
 

00:35:38.350 --> 00:35:40.620
around so anything you can do to improve
retention gives you compound growth over

00:35:40.620 --> 00:35:40.630
retention gives you compound growth over
 

00:35:40.630 --> 00:35:42.150
retention gives you compound growth over
the long term and yeah it's going to

00:35:42.150 --> 00:35:42.160
the long term and yeah it's going to
 

00:35:42.160 --> 00:35:44.220
the long term and yeah it's going to
also be a multiplier on your acquisition

00:35:44.220 --> 00:35:44.230
also be a multiplier on your acquisition
 

00:35:44.230 --> 00:35:49.230
also be a multiplier on your acquisition
efforts so at Sound Cloud the way that

00:35:49.230 --> 00:35:49.240
efforts so at Sound Cloud the way that
 

00:35:49.240 --> 00:35:51.300
efforts so at Sound Cloud the way that
we looked at retention was I mean you

00:35:51.300 --> 00:35:51.310
we looked at retention was I mean you
 

00:35:51.310 --> 00:35:54.570
we looked at retention was I mean you
can think about retention in terms of

00:35:54.570 --> 00:35:54.580
can think about retention in terms of
 

00:35:54.580 --> 00:35:56.510
can think about retention in terms of
like when you when you look at your

00:35:56.510 --> 00:35:56.520
like when you when you look at your
 

00:35:56.520 --> 00:36:00.570
like when you when you look at your
users in any given period so for example

00:36:00.570 --> 00:36:00.580
users in any given period so for example
 

00:36:00.580 --> 00:36:03.780
users in any given period so for example
here is a example from the the may users

00:36:03.780 --> 00:36:03.790
here is a example from the the may users
 

00:36:03.790 --> 00:36:05.760
here is a example from the the may users
at SoundCloud they broke into these

00:36:05.760 --> 00:36:05.770
at SoundCloud they broke into these
 

00:36:05.770 --> 00:36:07.320
at SoundCloud they broke into these
these three different buckets so you can

00:36:07.320 --> 00:36:07.330
these three different buckets so you can
 

00:36:07.330 --> 00:36:08.940
these three different buckets so you can
think about you always have some new

00:36:08.940 --> 00:36:08.950
think about you always have some new
 

00:36:08.950 --> 00:36:12.480
think about you always have some new
users who've just arrived and then at

00:36:12.480 --> 00:36:12.490
users who've just arrived and then at
 

00:36:12.490 --> 00:36:14.520
users who've just arrived and then at
some time we talked about repeat and

00:36:14.520 --> 00:36:14.530
some time we talked about repeat and
 

00:36:14.530 --> 00:36:16.050
some time we talked about repeat and
returning users so I'm going to just

00:36:16.050 --> 00:36:16.060
returning users so I'm going to just
 

00:36:16.060 --> 00:36:18.660
returning users so I'm going to just
take a moment to explain the difference

00:36:18.660 --> 00:36:18.670
take a moment to explain the difference
 

00:36:18.670 --> 00:36:21.030
take a moment to explain the difference
between those two buckets so a repeat

00:36:21.030 --> 00:36:21.040
between those two buckets so a repeat
 

00:36:21.040 --> 00:36:22.650
between those two buckets so a repeat
user is someone who was here in the last

00:36:22.650 --> 00:36:22.660
user is someone who was here in the last
 

00:36:22.660 --> 00:36:25.380
user is someone who was here in the last
period and he's here again this period

00:36:25.380 --> 00:36:25.390
period and he's here again this period
 

00:36:25.390 --> 00:36:27.570
period and he's here again this period
or she is here again this period so this

00:36:27.570 --> 00:36:27.580
or she is here again this period so this
 

00:36:27.580 --> 00:36:31.410
or she is here again this period so this
is a oil user who is currently engaged

00:36:31.410 --> 00:36:31.420
is a oil user who is currently engaged
 

00:36:31.420 --> 00:36:35.310
is a oil user who is currently engaged
and is using your app regularly what you

00:36:35.310 --> 00:36:35.320
and is using your app regularly what you
 

00:36:35.320 --> 00:36:36.780
and is using your app regularly what you
often find is that there's also a large

00:36:36.780 --> 00:36:36.790
often find is that there's also a large
 

00:36:36.790 --> 00:36:38.880
often find is that there's also a large
bucket of what what we referred to as

00:36:38.880 --> 00:36:38.890
bucket of what what we referred to as
 

00:36:38.890 --> 00:36:42.030
bucket of what what we referred to as
returning users so these are users who

00:36:42.030 --> 00:36:42.040
returning users so these are users who
 

00:36:42.040 --> 00:36:44.400
returning users so these are users who
were not seen in the last period so the

00:36:44.400 --> 00:36:44.410
were not seen in the last period so the
 

00:36:44.410 --> 00:36:46.710
were not seen in the last period so the
period that said they were not seen last

00:36:46.710 --> 00:36:46.720
period that said they were not seen last
 

00:36:46.720 --> 00:36:48.660
period that said they were not seen last
month but they're here this month but

00:36:48.660 --> 00:36:48.670
month but they're here this month but
 

00:36:48.670 --> 00:36:50.280
month but they're here this month but
they signed up more than one month ago

00:36:50.280 --> 00:36:50.290
they signed up more than one month ago
 

00:36:50.290 --> 00:36:52.710
they signed up more than one month ago
and this bucket actually is usually

00:36:52.710 --> 00:36:52.720
and this bucket actually is usually
 

00:36:52.720 --> 00:36:54.120
and this bucket actually is usually
pretty large particularly few apps been

00:36:54.120 --> 00:36:54.130
pretty large particularly few apps been
 

00:36:54.130 --> 00:36:56.280
pretty large particularly few apps been
around for a while and these users

00:36:56.280 --> 00:36:56.290
around for a while and these users
 

00:36:56.290 --> 00:36:58.740
around for a while and these users
haven't necessarily turned in the case

00:36:58.740 --> 00:36:58.750
haven't necessarily turned in the case
 

00:36:58.750 --> 00:37:00.810
haven't necessarily turned in the case
in the sense of like that they've really

00:37:00.810 --> 00:37:00.820
in the sense of like that they've really
 

00:37:00.820 --> 00:37:02.250
in the sense of like that they've really
abandoned your app they might just be

00:37:02.250 --> 00:37:02.260
abandoned your app they might just be
 

00:37:02.260 --> 00:37:04.530
abandoned your app they might just be
very casual users who you know maybe

00:37:04.530 --> 00:37:04.540
very casual users who you know maybe
 

00:37:04.540 --> 00:37:06.870
very casual users who you know maybe
they use use your app you know once or

00:37:06.870 --> 00:37:06.880
they use use your app you know once or
 

00:37:06.880 --> 00:37:09.840
they use use your app you know once or
twice a month or you know a few times a

00:37:09.840 --> 00:37:09.850
twice a month or you know a few times a
 

00:37:09.850 --> 00:37:12.420
twice a month or you know a few times a
year and depending on your app and the

00:37:12.420 --> 00:37:12.430
year and depending on your app and the
 

00:37:12.430 --> 00:37:14.130
year and depending on your app and the
particular kind of use case that you're

00:37:14.130 --> 00:37:14.140
particular kind of use case that you're
 

00:37:14.140 --> 00:37:15.750
particular kind of use case that you're
solving maybe that's that's okay but

00:37:15.750 --> 00:37:15.760
solving maybe that's that's okay but
 

00:37:15.760 --> 00:37:17.760
solving maybe that's that's okay but
probably most apps you really want users

00:37:17.760 --> 00:37:17.770
probably most apps you really want users
 

00:37:17.770 --> 00:37:19.920
probably most apps you really want users
coming back every week or even every day

00:37:19.920 --> 00:37:19.930
coming back every week or even every day
 

00:37:19.930 --> 00:37:22.950
coming back every week or even every day
or even multiple times per day so really

00:37:22.950 --> 00:37:22.960
or even multiple times per day so really
 

00:37:22.960 --> 00:37:24.480
or even multiple times per day so really
the way that we approached it at

00:37:24.480 --> 00:37:24.490
the way that we approached it at
 

00:37:24.490 --> 00:37:25.920
the way that we approached it at
SoundCloud was that we wanted people

00:37:25.920 --> 00:37:25.930
SoundCloud was that we wanted people
 

00:37:25.930 --> 00:37:28.800
SoundCloud was that we wanted people
listening to music on SoundCloud every

00:37:28.800 --> 00:37:28.810
listening to music on SoundCloud every
 

00:37:28.810 --> 00:37:30.480
listening to music on SoundCloud every
day preferably for many hours and so

00:37:30.480 --> 00:37:30.490
day preferably for many hours and so
 

00:37:30.490 --> 00:37:31.740
day preferably for many hours and so
really it was all about growing that

00:37:31.740 --> 00:37:31.750
really it was all about growing that
 

00:37:31.750 --> 00:37:34.440
really it was all about growing that
repeat user bucket turning new users

00:37:34.440 --> 00:37:34.450
repeat user bucket turning new users
 

00:37:34.450 --> 00:37:36.280
repeat user bucket turning new users
into repeat users and then keeping

00:37:36.280 --> 00:37:36.290
into repeat users and then keeping
 

00:37:36.290 --> 00:37:39.880
into repeat users and then keeping
there and then yeah reactivating users

00:37:39.880 --> 00:37:39.890
there and then yeah reactivating users
 

00:37:39.890 --> 00:37:42.490
there and then yeah reactivating users
who who had lapsed but reactivation is

00:37:42.490 --> 00:37:42.500
who who had lapsed but reactivation is
 

00:37:42.500 --> 00:37:43.900
who who had lapsed but reactivation is
really tough and I'll talk a bit more

00:37:43.900 --> 00:37:43.910
really tough and I'll talk a bit more
 

00:37:43.910 --> 00:37:48.090
really tough and I'll talk a bit more
about that later so how do we like

00:37:48.090 --> 00:37:48.100
about that later so how do we like
 

00:37:48.100 --> 00:37:52.360
about that later so how do we like
approach this idea of like keeping users

00:37:52.360 --> 00:37:52.370
approach this idea of like keeping users
 

00:37:52.370 --> 00:37:54.730
approach this idea of like keeping users
engaged keeping keeping users from

00:37:54.730 --> 00:37:54.740
engaged keeping keeping users from
 

00:37:54.740 --> 00:37:56.710
engaged keeping keeping users from
dropping out of this loop and it's like

00:37:56.710 --> 00:37:56.720
dropping out of this loop and it's like
 

00:37:56.720 --> 00:37:59.370
dropping out of this loop and it's like
the way that the way that I sort of

00:37:59.370 --> 00:37:59.380
the way that the way that I sort of
 

00:37:59.380 --> 00:38:01.120
the way that the way that I sort of
conceptualize it is that you're building

00:38:01.120 --> 00:38:01.130
conceptualize it is that you're building
 

00:38:01.130 --> 00:38:02.880
conceptualize it is that you're building
growth machines you want to build

00:38:02.880 --> 00:38:02.890
growth machines you want to build
 

00:38:02.890 --> 00:38:06.610
growth machines you want to build
repeatable loops processes which through

00:38:06.610 --> 00:38:06.620
repeatable loops processes which through
 

00:38:06.620 --> 00:38:09.580
repeatable loops processes which through
testing you've proven to like have a

00:38:09.580 --> 00:38:09.590
testing you've proven to like have a
 

00:38:09.590 --> 00:38:12.730
testing you've proven to like have a
strong impact or a positive impact at

00:38:12.730 --> 00:38:12.740
strong impact or a positive impact at
 

00:38:12.740 --> 00:38:14.440
strong impact or a positive impact at
least on on your your retention numbers

00:38:14.440 --> 00:38:14.450
least on on your your retention numbers
 

00:38:14.450 --> 00:38:17.740
least on on your your retention numbers
so this could be I'll talk about

00:38:17.740 --> 00:38:17.750
so this could be I'll talk about
 

00:38:17.750 --> 00:38:19.720
so this could be I'll talk about
activity notifications as a prime

00:38:19.720 --> 00:38:19.730
activity notifications as a prime
 

00:38:19.730 --> 00:38:21.340
activity notifications as a prime
example of this in a minute but there

00:38:21.340 --> 00:38:21.350
example of this in a minute but there
 

00:38:21.350 --> 00:38:23.440
example of this in a minute but there
are other things you can do

00:38:23.440 --> 00:38:23.450
are other things you can do
 

00:38:23.450 --> 00:38:25.900
are other things you can do
could be a loyalty scheme that sort of

00:38:25.900 --> 00:38:25.910
could be a loyalty scheme that sort of
 

00:38:25.910 --> 00:38:27.700
could be a loyalty scheme that sort of
fear with point or gamification

00:38:27.700 --> 00:38:27.710
fear with point or gamification
 

00:38:27.710 --> 00:38:29.500
fear with point or gamification
something like this anything you can do

00:38:29.500 --> 00:38:29.510
something like this anything you can do
 

00:38:29.510 --> 00:38:33.160
something like this anything you can do
that basically you can put it on sort of

00:38:33.160 --> 00:38:33.170
that basically you can put it on sort of
 

00:38:33.170 --> 00:38:35.080
that basically you can put it on sort of
autopilot once if you test it and

00:38:35.080 --> 00:38:35.090
autopilot once if you test it and
 

00:38:35.090 --> 00:38:36.700
autopilot once if you test it and
optimize it and iterate it on it to a

00:38:36.700 --> 00:38:36.710
optimize it and iterate it on it to a
 

00:38:36.710 --> 00:38:38.560
optimize it and iterate it on it to a
certain level that it just keeps going

00:38:38.560 --> 00:38:38.570
certain level that it just keeps going
 

00:38:38.570 --> 00:38:40.810
certain level that it just keeps going
and it keeps like pushing some users

00:38:40.810 --> 00:38:40.820
and it keeps like pushing some users
 

00:38:40.820 --> 00:38:42.310
and it keeps like pushing some users
into a higher engaged State and

00:38:42.310 --> 00:38:42.320
into a higher engaged State and
 

00:38:42.320 --> 00:38:44.620
into a higher engaged State and
basically interacting with users ideally

00:38:44.620 --> 00:38:44.630
basically interacting with users ideally
 

00:38:44.630 --> 00:38:49.780
basically interacting with users ideally
before they churn and so I'll talk a

00:38:49.780 --> 00:38:49.790
before they churn and so I'll talk a
 

00:38:49.790 --> 00:38:52.300
before they churn and so I'll talk a
little bit about activity notifications

00:38:52.300 --> 00:38:52.310
little bit about activity notifications
 

00:38:52.310 --> 00:38:55.120
little bit about activity notifications
which was actually one of the projects

00:38:55.120 --> 00:38:55.130
which was actually one of the projects
 

00:38:55.130 --> 00:38:56.830
which was actually one of the projects
that I spent most of the last year

00:38:56.830 --> 00:38:56.840
that I spent most of the last year
 

00:38:56.840 --> 00:38:59.050
that I spent most of the last year
really building up at SoundCloud was to

00:38:59.050 --> 00:38:59.060
really building up at SoundCloud was to
 

00:38:59.060 --> 00:39:01.950
really building up at SoundCloud was to
build out a new activity notification

00:39:01.950 --> 00:39:01.960
build out a new activity notification
 

00:39:01.960 --> 00:39:05.560
build out a new activity notification
infrastructure for the company so what

infrastructure for the company so what
our activity notifications they're sort

00:39:07.780 --> 00:39:07.790
our activity notifications they're sort
 

00:39:07.790 --> 00:39:10.870
our activity notifications they're sort
of real-time notifications could be push

which was actually the first channel
 

00:39:12.440 --> 00:39:14.470
which was actually the first channel
that we deployed them to but can also be

getting in touch with the user to tell

00:39:22.330 --> 00:39:22.340
getting in touch with the user to tell
 

00:39:22.340 --> 00:39:24.490
getting in touch with the user to tell
them something hopefully interesting and

00:39:24.490 --> 00:39:24.500
them something hopefully interesting and
 

00:39:24.500 --> 00:39:27.060
them something hopefully interesting and
relevant to them in a timely fashion

00:39:27.060 --> 00:39:27.070
relevant to them in a timely fashion
 

00:39:27.070 --> 00:39:29.050
relevant to them in a timely fashion
about something that's happened when

00:39:29.050 --> 00:39:29.060
about something that's happened when
 

00:39:29.060 --> 00:39:30.760
about something that's happened when
they're they're not in the app now it's

scenario but at Sound Cloud for example
 

00:39:34.700 --> 00:39:35.830

there are plenty of things that happen

00:39:35.830 --> 00:39:35.840
there are plenty of things that happen
 

00:39:35.840 --> 00:39:37.390
there are plenty of things that happen
when you're not in the app that you

00:39:37.390 --> 00:39:37.400
when you're not in the app that you
 

00:39:37.400 --> 00:39:38.740
when you're not in the app that you
might be interested in it could be that

00:39:38.740 --> 00:39:38.750
might be interested in it could be that
 

00:39:38.750 --> 00:39:40.330
might be interested in it could be that
artist that you're following have

artist that you're following have
 

00:39:40.340 --> 00:39:42.400
artist that you're following have
released new tracks and you might want

00:39:42.400 --> 00:39:42.410
released new tracks and you might want
 

00:39:42.410 --> 00:39:43.660
released new tracks and you might want
to be told about them because you might

00:39:43.660 --> 00:39:43.670
to be told about them because you might
 

00:39:43.670 --> 00:39:44.710
to be told about them because you might
want to come and listen to them

00:39:44.710 --> 00:39:44.720
want to come and listen to them
 

00:39:44.720 --> 00:39:46.510
want to come and listen to them
it could be that I've created a playlist

00:39:46.510 --> 00:39:46.520
it could be that I've created a playlist
 

00:39:46.520 --> 00:39:49.270
it could be that I've created a playlist
and somebody has interacted with it

00:39:49.270 --> 00:39:49.280
and somebody has interacted with it
 

00:39:49.280 --> 00:39:49.640
and somebody has interacted with it
somebody

00:39:49.640 --> 00:39:49.650
somebody
 

00:39:49.650 --> 00:39:52.460
somebody
liked it or reposted it somewhere and so

00:39:52.460 --> 00:39:52.470
liked it or reposted it somewhere and so
 

00:39:52.470 --> 00:39:54.349
liked it or reposted it somewhere and so
these kind of like social interaction

00:39:54.349 --> 00:39:54.359
these kind of like social interaction
 

00:39:54.359 --> 00:39:57.740
these kind of like social interaction
social signals or just new content new

00:39:57.740 --> 00:39:57.750
social signals or just new content new
 

00:39:57.750 --> 00:39:59.059
social signals or just new content new
content is a great one and it's

00:39:59.059 --> 00:39:59.069
content is a great one and it's
 

00:39:59.069 --> 00:40:01.250
content is a great one and it's
definitely was the highest performer for

00:40:01.250 --> 00:40:01.260
definitely was the highest performer for
 

00:40:01.260 --> 00:40:04.130
definitely was the highest performer for
for SoundCloud in terms of being able to

00:40:04.130 --> 00:40:04.140
for SoundCloud in terms of being able to
 

00:40:04.140 --> 00:40:05.599
for SoundCloud in terms of being able to
tell people that there's hey there's new

00:40:05.599 --> 00:40:05.609
tell people that there's hey there's new
 

00:40:05.609 --> 00:40:06.589
tell people that there's hey there's new
music that you might want to come and

00:40:06.589 --> 00:40:06.599
music that you might want to come and
 

00:40:06.599 --> 00:40:09.230
music that you might want to come and
listen to was fantastic

00:40:09.230 --> 00:40:09.240
listen to was fantastic
 

00:40:09.240 --> 00:40:11.870
listen to was fantastic
in terms of performance so I mean just

00:40:11.870 --> 00:40:11.880
in terms of performance so I mean just
 

00:40:11.880 --> 00:40:13.880
in terms of performance so I mean just
to give you some idea with the new

00:40:13.880 --> 00:40:13.890
to give you some idea with the new
 

00:40:13.890 --> 00:40:15.380
to give you some idea with the new
notifications that we rolled out we

00:40:15.380 --> 00:40:15.390
notifications that we rolled out we
 

00:40:15.390 --> 00:40:18.230
notifications that we rolled out we
built out like five new notification

00:40:18.230 --> 00:40:18.240
built out like five new notification
 

00:40:18.240 --> 00:40:21.079
built out like five new notification
types and like between that combination

00:40:21.079 --> 00:40:21.089
types and like between that combination
 

00:40:21.089 --> 00:40:23.210
types and like between that combination
we were able to increase retention by

00:40:23.210 --> 00:40:23.220
we were able to increase retention by
 

00:40:23.220 --> 00:40:26.329
we were able to increase retention by
around 5% like absolute percentage

00:40:26.329 --> 00:40:26.339
around 5% like absolute percentage
 

00:40:26.339 --> 00:40:28.819
around 5% like absolute percentage
points which is which is yeah pretty

00:40:28.819 --> 00:40:28.829
points which is which is yeah pretty
 

00:40:28.829 --> 00:40:33.049
points which is which is yeah pretty
significant so like what do we actually

00:40:33.049 --> 00:40:33.059
significant so like what do we actually
 

00:40:33.059 --> 00:40:38.750
significant so like what do we actually
build it's more than just coding like

00:40:38.750 --> 00:40:38.760
build it's more than just coding like
 

00:40:38.760 --> 00:40:40.490
build it's more than just coding like
these these notifications to say okay

00:40:40.490 --> 00:40:40.500
these these notifications to say okay
 

00:40:40.500 --> 00:40:42.019
these these notifications to say okay
tell the user that something happened

00:40:42.019 --> 00:40:42.029
tell the user that something happened
 

00:40:42.029 --> 00:40:43.220
tell the user that something happened
like what we actually wanted to build

00:40:43.220 --> 00:40:43.230
like what we actually wanted to build
 

00:40:43.230 --> 00:40:46.640
like what we actually wanted to build
was a measurement and experimental

00:40:46.640 --> 00:40:46.650
was a measurement and experimental
 

00:40:46.650 --> 00:40:49.430
was a measurement and experimental
framework around that such that we're

00:40:49.430 --> 00:40:49.440
framework around that such that we're
 

00:40:49.440 --> 00:40:51.710
framework around that such that we're
actually able to test and iterate on

00:40:51.710 --> 00:40:51.720
actually able to test and iterate on
 

00:40:51.720 --> 00:40:53.089
actually able to test and iterate on
these notifications and to measure the

00:40:53.089 --> 00:40:53.099
these notifications and to measure the
 

00:40:53.099 --> 00:40:55.160
these notifications and to measure the
impact measurement is really a tough

00:40:55.160 --> 00:40:55.170
impact measurement is really a tough
 

00:40:55.170 --> 00:40:57.250
impact measurement is really a tough
thing with retention because everything

00:40:57.250 --> 00:40:57.260
thing with retention because everything
 

00:40:57.260 --> 00:41:00.019
thing with retention because everything
affects retention like you know any

00:41:00.019 --> 00:41:00.029
affects retention like you know any
 

00:41:00.029 --> 00:41:01.309
affects retention like you know any
product change that you make is likely

00:41:01.309 --> 00:41:01.319
product change that you make is likely
 

00:41:01.319 --> 00:41:02.809
product change that you make is likely
to affect your attention your

00:41:02.809 --> 00:41:02.819
to affect your attention your
 

00:41:02.819 --> 00:41:04.609
to affect your attention your
acquisition mix will also affect your

00:41:04.609 --> 00:41:04.619
acquisition mix will also affect your
 

00:41:04.619 --> 00:41:06.920
acquisition mix will also affect your
attention so it's really important when

00:41:06.920 --> 00:41:06.930
attention so it's really important when
 

00:41:06.930 --> 00:41:10.370
attention so it's really important when
you're you know running any initiative

00:41:10.370 --> 00:41:10.380
you're you know running any initiative
 

00:41:10.380 --> 00:41:11.870
you're you know running any initiative
that you you hope to improve retention

00:41:11.870 --> 00:41:11.880
that you you hope to improve retention
 

00:41:11.880 --> 00:41:13.970
that you you hope to improve retention
that you're always have some kind of

00:41:13.970 --> 00:41:13.980
that you're always have some kind of
 

00:41:13.980 --> 00:41:16.819
that you're always have some kind of
control group that is not exposed to

00:41:16.819 --> 00:41:16.829
control group that is not exposed to
 

00:41:16.829 --> 00:41:17.870
control group that is not exposed to
whatever change that you're going to

00:41:17.870 --> 00:41:17.880
whatever change that you're going to
 

00:41:17.880 --> 00:41:19.220
whatever change that you're going to
make and that that control group is

00:41:19.220 --> 00:41:19.230
make and that that control group is
 

00:41:19.230 --> 00:41:21.470
make and that that control group is
basically representing everything else

00:41:21.470 --> 00:41:21.480
basically representing everything else
 

00:41:21.480 --> 00:41:22.789
basically representing everything else
that's going on in the platform because

00:41:22.789 --> 00:41:22.799
that's going on in the platform because
 

00:41:22.799 --> 00:41:24.170
that's going on in the platform because
it's it's quite a volatile number

00:41:24.170 --> 00:41:24.180
it's it's quite a volatile number
 

00:41:24.180 --> 00:41:26.630
it's it's quite a volatile number
typically so we always had a group of

00:41:26.630 --> 00:41:26.640
typically so we always had a group of
 

00:41:26.640 --> 00:41:28.160
typically so we always had a group of
users who never received any

00:41:28.160 --> 00:41:28.170
users who never received any
 

00:41:28.170 --> 00:41:31.190
users who never received any
notifications and then we would test our

00:41:31.190 --> 00:41:31.200
notifications and then we would test our
 

00:41:31.200 --> 00:41:33.109
notifications and then we would test our
new notifications with with with test

00:41:33.109 --> 00:41:33.119
new notifications with with with test
 

00:41:33.119 --> 00:41:35.450
new notifications with with with test
groups an a/b test all the while with

00:41:35.450 --> 00:41:35.460
groups an a/b test all the while with
 

00:41:35.460 --> 00:41:40.970
groups an a/b test all the while with
copy with timing with yeah the different

00:41:40.970 --> 00:41:40.980
copy with timing with yeah the different
 

00:41:40.980 --> 00:41:42.470
copy with timing with yeah the different
kind of mix and combination of

00:41:42.470 --> 00:41:42.480
kind of mix and combination of
 

00:41:42.480 --> 00:41:45.109
kind of mix and combination of
notifications that we would send so this

00:41:45.109 --> 00:41:45.119
notifications that we would send so this
 

00:41:45.119 --> 00:41:46.880
notifications that we would send so this
there's a lot of experiments to run and

00:41:46.880 --> 00:41:46.890
there's a lot of experiments to run and
 

00:41:46.890 --> 00:41:49.160
there's a lot of experiments to run and
and just as Max was saying it's

00:41:49.160 --> 00:41:49.170
and just as Max was saying it's
 

00:41:49.170 --> 00:41:50.720
and just as Max was saying it's
something that's never really done it's

00:41:50.720 --> 00:41:50.730
something that's never really done it's
 

00:41:50.730 --> 00:41:55.089
something that's never really done it's
never really finished so yeah like

00:41:55.089 --> 00:41:55.099
never really finished so yeah like
 

00:41:55.099 --> 00:41:57.140
never really finished so yeah like
SoundCloud will continue to iterate on

00:41:57.140 --> 00:41:57.150
SoundCloud will continue to iterate on
 

00:41:57.150 --> 00:41:58.819
SoundCloud will continue to iterate on
these notifications to build out new

00:41:58.819 --> 00:41:58.829
these notifications to build out new
 

00:41:58.829 --> 00:42:01.579
these notifications to build out new
types and I think they're the next phase

00:42:01.579 --> 00:42:01.589
types and I think they're the next phase
 

00:42:01.589 --> 00:42:03.370
types and I think they're the next phase
now that we have

00:42:03.370 --> 00:42:03.380
now that we have
 

00:42:03.380 --> 00:42:04.810
now that we have
sort of a pretty pretty cool

00:42:04.810 --> 00:42:04.820
sort of a pretty pretty cool
 

00:42:04.820 --> 00:42:07.420
sort of a pretty pretty cool
notification system is that they'll

00:42:07.420 --> 00:42:07.430
notification system is that they'll
 

00:42:07.430 --> 00:42:08.560
notification system is that they'll
start to add like a layer of

00:42:08.560 --> 00:42:08.570
start to add like a layer of
 

00:42:08.570 --> 00:42:10.750
start to add like a layer of
intelligence on top of that so getting

00:42:10.750 --> 00:42:10.760
intelligence on top of that so getting
 

00:42:10.760 --> 00:42:13.840
intelligence on top of that so getting
smarter about optimizing for relevance

00:42:13.840 --> 00:42:13.850
smarter about optimizing for relevance
 

00:42:13.850 --> 00:42:15.190
smarter about optimizing for relevance
of notifications which is super

00:42:15.190 --> 00:42:15.200
of notifications which is super
 

00:42:15.200 --> 00:42:17.530
of notifications which is super
important

00:42:17.530 --> 00:42:17.540
important
 

00:42:17.540 --> 00:42:19.930
important
and yeah so sort of final points just on

00:42:19.930 --> 00:42:19.940
and yeah so sort of final points just on
 

00:42:19.940 --> 00:42:22.270
and yeah so sort of final points just on
like how to build good notifications

00:42:22.270 --> 00:42:22.280
like how to build good notifications
 

00:42:22.280 --> 00:42:24.210
like how to build good notifications
it's really all about personalization

00:42:24.210 --> 00:42:24.220
it's really all about personalization
 

00:42:24.220 --> 00:42:26.680
it's really all about personalization
and again this kind of comes back to the

00:42:26.680 --> 00:42:26.690
and again this kind of comes back to the
 

00:42:26.690 --> 00:42:32.380
and again this kind of comes back to the
point about iteration so we have we have

00:42:32.380 --> 00:42:32.390
point about iteration so we have we have
 

00:42:32.390 --> 00:42:34.480
point about iteration so we have we have
a reactivation notification that we do

00:42:34.480 --> 00:42:34.490
a reactivation notification that we do
 

00:42:34.490 --> 00:42:36.460
a reactivation notification that we do
we send to users when we haven't seen

00:42:36.460 --> 00:42:36.470
we send to users when we haven't seen
 

00:42:36.470 --> 00:42:38.200
we send to users when we haven't seen
them in the app for five days at Sound

00:42:38.200 --> 00:42:38.210
them in the app for five days at Sound
 

00:42:38.210 --> 00:42:42.340
them in the app for five days at Sound
Cloud because we we figured out again

00:42:42.340 --> 00:42:42.350
Cloud because we we figured out again
 

00:42:42.350 --> 00:42:44.200
Cloud because we we figured out again
through testing that five days was a

00:42:44.200 --> 00:42:44.210
through testing that five days was a
 

00:42:44.210 --> 00:42:45.340
through testing that five days was a
good time to interact with the user

00:42:45.340 --> 00:42:45.350
good time to interact with the user
 

00:42:45.350 --> 00:42:47.620
good time to interact with the user
before they really likely to churn

00:42:47.620 --> 00:42:47.630
before they really likely to churn
 

00:42:47.630 --> 00:42:49.570
before they really likely to churn
completely but there it's already sort

00:42:49.570 --> 00:42:49.580
completely but there it's already sort
 

00:42:49.580 --> 00:42:52.720
completely but there it's already sort
of risk of churn at that point so we'd

00:42:52.720 --> 00:42:52.730
of risk of churn at that point so we'd
 

00:42:52.730 --> 00:42:54.190
of risk of churn at that point so we'd
send them a notification and and

00:42:54.190 --> 00:42:54.200
send them a notification and and
 

00:42:54.200 --> 00:42:56.590
send them a notification and and
probably like a lot of people who who

00:42:56.590 --> 00:42:56.600
probably like a lot of people who who
 

00:42:56.600 --> 00:42:58.690
probably like a lot of people who who
start off with with reactivation we

00:42:58.690 --> 00:42:58.700
start off with with reactivation we
 

00:42:58.700 --> 00:43:00.220
start off with with reactivation we
started with something very basic it was

00:43:00.220 --> 00:43:00.230
started with something very basic it was
 

00:43:00.230 --> 00:43:03.340
started with something very basic it was
like hey come back and find more music

00:43:03.340 --> 00:43:03.350
like hey come back and find more music
 

00:43:03.350 --> 00:43:05.320
like hey come back and find more music
on soundcloud like basically just a very

00:43:05.320 --> 00:43:05.330
on soundcloud like basically just a very
 

00:43:05.330 --> 00:43:07.360
on soundcloud like basically just a very
generic like we miss you kind of message

00:43:07.360 --> 00:43:07.370
generic like we miss you kind of message
 

00:43:07.370 --> 00:43:10.450
generic like we miss you kind of message
and yeah perhaps unsurprisingly that the

00:43:10.450 --> 00:43:10.460
and yeah perhaps unsurprisingly that the
 

00:43:10.460 --> 00:43:13.090
and yeah perhaps unsurprisingly that the
click ride was was super poor the impact

00:43:13.090 --> 00:43:13.100
click ride was was super poor the impact
 

00:43:13.100 --> 00:43:14.830
click ride was was super poor the impact
was you know it was still worth having

00:43:14.830 --> 00:43:14.840
was you know it was still worth having
 

00:43:14.840 --> 00:43:18.250
was you know it was still worth having
but it was pretty minimal and so we

00:43:18.250 --> 00:43:18.260
but it was pretty minimal and so we
 

00:43:18.260 --> 00:43:19.570
but it was pretty minimal and so we
thought okay how can we iterate on that

00:43:19.570 --> 00:43:19.580
thought okay how can we iterate on that
 

00:43:19.580 --> 00:43:22.300
thought okay how can we iterate on that
so we what we ended up with which is

00:43:22.300 --> 00:43:22.310
so we what we ended up with which is
 

00:43:22.310 --> 00:43:24.610
so we what we ended up with which is
performing way better was a kind of a

00:43:24.610 --> 00:43:24.620
performing way better was a kind of a
 

00:43:24.620 --> 00:43:26.050
performing way better was a kind of a
three tiered approach where we look at

00:43:26.050 --> 00:43:26.060
three tiered approach where we look at
 

00:43:26.060 --> 00:43:29.290
three tiered approach where we look at
like okay has this user shown some kind

00:43:29.290 --> 00:43:29.300
like okay has this user shown some kind
 

00:43:29.300 --> 00:43:31.210
like okay has this user shown some kind
of engagement within the app that we can

00:43:31.210 --> 00:43:31.220
of engagement within the app that we can
 

00:43:31.220 --> 00:43:33.910
of engagement within the app that we can
use in you know reactivation message so

00:43:33.910 --> 00:43:33.920
use in you know reactivation message so
 

00:43:33.920 --> 00:43:36.670
use in you know reactivation message so
we looked at how the user liked the

00:43:36.670 --> 00:43:36.680
we looked at how the user liked the
 

00:43:36.680 --> 00:43:38.410
we looked at how the user liked the
track because that's a really high level

00:43:38.410 --> 00:43:38.420
track because that's a really high level
 

00:43:38.420 --> 00:43:39.520
track because that's a really high level
of engagement if they've actually hit

00:43:39.520 --> 00:43:39.530
of engagement if they've actually hit
 

00:43:39.530 --> 00:43:43.030
of engagement if they've actually hit
the like button and so if a user liked a

00:43:43.030 --> 00:43:43.040
the like button and so if a user liked a
 

00:43:43.040 --> 00:43:45.190
the like button and so if a user liked a
track in the past we look at that the

00:43:45.190 --> 00:43:45.200
track in the past we look at that the
 

00:43:45.200 --> 00:43:46.630
track in the past we look at that the
last track that they liked and in that

00:43:46.630 --> 00:43:46.640
last track that they liked and in that
 

00:43:46.640 --> 00:43:50.380
last track that they liked and in that
reactivation message we say hey not just

00:43:50.380 --> 00:43:50.390
reactivation message we say hey not just
 

00:43:50.390 --> 00:43:52.600
reactivation message we say hey not just
come back and find some more music on

00:43:52.600 --> 00:43:52.610
come back and find some more music on
 

00:43:52.610 --> 00:43:54.190
come back and find some more music on
sampler but we say hey come back and

00:43:54.190 --> 00:43:54.200
sampler but we say hey come back and
 

00:43:54.200 --> 00:43:56.230
sampler but we say hey come back and
find some more music from artist X

00:43:56.230 --> 00:43:56.240
find some more music from artist X
 

00:43:56.240 --> 00:43:59.110
find some more music from artist X
artist X being the creator of the track

00:43:59.110 --> 00:43:59.120
artist X being the creator of the track
 

00:43:59.120 --> 00:44:01.480
artist X being the creator of the track
that they liked and if they haven't

00:44:01.480 --> 00:44:01.490
that they liked and if they haven't
 

00:44:01.490 --> 00:44:03.730
that they liked and if they haven't
liked to track then we look at the last

00:44:03.730 --> 00:44:03.740
liked to track then we look at the last
 

00:44:03.740 --> 00:44:04.990
liked to track then we look at the last
track that they played and we use that

00:44:04.990 --> 00:44:05.000
track that they played and we use that
 

00:44:05.000 --> 00:44:06.880
track that they played and we use that
as a signal and we personalize it in the

00:44:06.880 --> 00:44:06.890
as a signal and we personalize it in the
 

00:44:06.890 --> 00:44:08.110
as a signal and we personalize it in the
same way so if I listen to a Britney

00:44:08.110 --> 00:44:08.120
same way so if I listen to a Britney
 

00:44:08.120 --> 00:44:10.360
same way so if I listen to a Britney
Spears track my last track then we'd say

00:44:10.360 --> 00:44:10.370
Spears track my last track then we'd say
 

00:44:10.370 --> 00:44:11.710
Spears track my last track then we'd say
hey come back and find more music from

00:44:11.710 --> 00:44:11.720
hey come back and find more music from
 

00:44:11.720 --> 00:44:13.960
hey come back and find more music from
Britney Spears and we found that these

00:44:13.960 --> 00:44:13.970
Britney Spears and we found that these
 

00:44:13.970 --> 00:44:16.480
Britney Spears and we found that these
you know by by using what you know about

00:44:16.480 --> 00:44:16.490
you know by by using what you know about
 

00:44:16.490 --> 00:44:17.080
you know by by using what you know about
the users

00:44:17.080 --> 00:44:17.090
the users
 

00:44:17.090 --> 00:44:20.230
the users
usage history in those messages you can

00:44:20.230 --> 00:44:20.240
usage history in those messages you can
 

00:44:20.240 --> 00:44:22.000
usage history in those messages you can
really increase the click rate

00:44:22.000 --> 00:44:22.010
really increase the click rate
 

00:44:22.010 --> 00:44:23.440
really increase the click rate
dramatically I mean I think it was

00:44:23.440 --> 00:44:23.450
dramatically I mean I think it was
 

00:44:23.450 --> 00:44:25.510
dramatically I mean I think it was
something like a 5x increase in our

00:44:25.510 --> 00:44:25.520
something like a 5x increase in our
 

00:44:25.520 --> 00:44:28.950
something like a 5x increase in our
click rate albeit from a very low base

00:44:28.950 --> 00:44:28.960
click rate albeit from a very low base
 

00:44:28.960 --> 00:44:31.390
click rate albeit from a very low base
yeah time of day can also be pretty

00:44:31.390 --> 00:44:31.400
yeah time of day can also be pretty
 

00:44:31.400 --> 00:44:33.910
yeah time of day can also be pretty
important probably a good idea not to be

00:44:33.910 --> 00:44:33.920
important probably a good idea not to be
 

00:44:33.920 --> 00:44:35.320
important probably a good idea not to be
sending push notifications to people in

00:44:35.320 --> 00:44:35.330
sending push notifications to people in
 

00:44:35.330 --> 00:44:38.680
sending push notifications to people in
the middle of the night of course if

00:44:38.680 --> 00:44:38.690
the middle of the night of course if
 

00:44:38.690 --> 00:44:40.060
the middle of the night of course if
it's a real-time notification if it's

00:44:40.060 --> 00:44:40.070
it's a real-time notification if it's
 

00:44:40.070 --> 00:44:41.920
it's a real-time notification if it's
important enough maybe some people want

00:44:41.920 --> 00:44:41.930
important enough maybe some people want
 

00:44:41.930 --> 00:44:45.220
important enough maybe some people want
to be woken up but yeah it's like again

00:44:45.220 --> 00:44:45.230
to be woken up but yeah it's like again
 

00:44:45.230 --> 00:44:48.730
to be woken up but yeah it's like again
it's something to test and yeah really

00:44:48.730 --> 00:44:48.740
it's something to test and yeah really
 

00:44:48.740 --> 00:44:50.410
it's something to test and yeah really
importantly also to give users like

00:44:50.410 --> 00:44:50.420
importantly also to give users like
 

00:44:50.420 --> 00:44:52.450
importantly also to give users like
granular control over notifications if

00:44:52.450 --> 00:44:52.460
granular control over notifications if
 

00:44:52.460 --> 00:44:54.310
granular control over notifications if
they can just opt in or out of

00:44:54.310 --> 00:44:54.320
they can just opt in or out of
 

00:44:54.320 --> 00:44:57.310
they can just opt in or out of
notifications in general that's going to

00:44:57.310 --> 00:44:57.320
notifications in general that's going to
 

00:44:57.320 --> 00:45:00.820
notifications in general that's going to
really limit your like boldness when

00:45:00.820 --> 00:45:00.830
really limit your like boldness when
 

00:45:00.830 --> 00:45:02.890
really limit your like boldness when
you're testing new things because like

00:45:02.890 --> 00:45:02.900
you're testing new things because like
 

00:45:02.900 --> 00:45:04.240
you're testing new things because like
you'll be worried about people opting

00:45:04.240 --> 00:45:04.250
you'll be worried about people opting
 

00:45:04.250 --> 00:45:05.590
you'll be worried about people opting
out of push notifications altogether

00:45:05.590 --> 00:45:05.600
out of push notifications altogether
 

00:45:05.600 --> 00:45:08.800
out of push notifications altogether
which is a valid concern if you give

00:45:08.800 --> 00:45:08.810
which is a valid concern if you give
 

00:45:08.810 --> 00:45:10.810
which is a valid concern if you give
users the option to opt out of every

00:45:10.810 --> 00:45:10.820
users the option to opt out of every
 

00:45:10.820 --> 00:45:13.300
users the option to opt out of every
individual class of notifications so in

00:45:13.300 --> 00:45:13.310
individual class of notifications so in
 

00:45:13.310 --> 00:45:15.370
individual class of notifications so in
other words say I want to be told about

00:45:15.370 --> 00:45:15.380
other words say I want to be told about
 

00:45:15.380 --> 00:45:17.110
other words say I want to be told about
new tracks but I don't care if people

00:45:17.110 --> 00:45:17.120
new tracks but I don't care if people
 

00:45:17.120 --> 00:45:19.210
new tracks but I don't care if people
are following me I don't want to be be

00:45:19.210 --> 00:45:19.220
are following me I don't want to be be
 

00:45:19.220 --> 00:45:20.980
are following me I don't want to be be
notified about that by giving people

00:45:20.980 --> 00:45:20.990
notified about that by giving people
 

00:45:20.990 --> 00:45:23.140
notified about that by giving people
that granular level of control you can

00:45:23.140 --> 00:45:23.150
that granular level of control you can
 

00:45:23.150 --> 00:45:25.630
that granular level of control you can
be like more experimental and try bigger

00:45:25.630 --> 00:45:25.640
be like more experimental and try bigger
 

00:45:25.640 --> 00:45:27.520
be like more experimental and try bigger
ideas because you can that you likely

00:45:27.520 --> 00:45:27.530
ideas because you can that you likely
 

00:45:27.530 --> 00:45:28.720
ideas because you can that you likely
that they'll just opt out of that

00:45:28.720 --> 00:45:28.730
that they'll just opt out of that
 

00:45:28.730 --> 00:45:30.310
that they'll just opt out of that
particular type of notification rather

00:45:30.310 --> 00:45:30.320
particular type of notification rather
 

00:45:30.320 --> 00:45:31.990
particular type of notification rather
than all of your notifications so you

00:45:31.990 --> 00:45:32.000
than all of your notifications so you
 

00:45:32.000 --> 00:45:34.360
than all of your notifications so you
can minimize and mitigate against

00:45:34.360 --> 00:45:34.370
can minimize and mitigate against
 

00:45:34.370 --> 00:45:38.820
can minimize and mitigate against
negative impact yep that's it that's my

00:45:38.820 --> 00:45:38.830
negative impact yep that's it that's my
 

00:45:38.830 --> 00:45:41.920
negative impact yep that's it that's my
short lessons learned on building an

00:45:41.920 --> 00:45:41.930
short lessons learned on building an
 

00:45:41.930 --> 00:45:44.260
short lessons learned on building an
activity notification system and yeah

00:45:44.260 --> 00:45:44.270
activity notification system and yeah
 

00:45:44.270 --> 00:46:05.750
activity notification system and yeah
thanks very much

00:46:05.750 --> 00:46:05.760
 
 

00:46:05.760 --> 00:46:07.820
 
you
