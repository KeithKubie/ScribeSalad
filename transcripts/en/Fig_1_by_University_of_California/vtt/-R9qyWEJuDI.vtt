[Do high fives help sports teams win]

00:00:03.320 --> 00:00:04.830
You know, non-human primates

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:08.040
— the closest ones to us — they touch each other all the time

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:11.099
to spread goodwill and to build up
friendships, right

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:16.619
Touch is this very old system by
which we communicate to other people

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:20.730
and we're finding in our lab that, wow, we have this rich vocabulary

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:25.269
of goodwill and, and also we can communicate negative emotions with touch

00:00:25.269 --> 00:00:28.769
you know, how do we use that to build up
cooperative communities

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:32.079
so we studied the National Basketball
Association. If you just

00:00:32.079 --> 00:00:36.260
look at a basketball court, there's all and this touch going on: High fives, fist bumps,

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:37.380
embraces.

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:41.110
I love how basketball players, like when
they shoot a free throw they have to

00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:41.670
now

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:44.700
they all have to like reach for touch two guys,

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:48.420
step back,touch two guys. I mean,
that's incredible, right

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:51.480
and so we took one game of

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:55.199
every team in the NBA at the start of
the year and we coded

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:58.699
allof the touch that happened during
that game. It took us

00:00:58.699 --> 00:01:02.949
eight months. Here's what we found, which is that a game is 48 minutes and there's

00:01:02.949 --> 00:01:03.460
kind of

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:07.070
summed up about a minute and a half
of touch during that game.

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:11.210
The more that a team touched each other
at the start of the year,

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:14.750
controlling for how much money they're
making, the

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:18.170
expectations that they would do well
during that season, how well they're

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:19.380
doing in that game

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:23.740
that we coded — at the end of the year not
only did they win more games,

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:27.180
but they're really nice basketball
statistics of how

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:31.329
selfless the play is, do they help on
defense, do they set a screen

00:01:31.329 --> 00:01:35.329
and the were playing more efficiently

00:01:35.329 --> 00:01:38.590
and cooperatively, right, so we think that
touch

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:43.270
is really part have how teams do well.
