00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:03.600
It should be clear now that the first
question to consider, in terms of,

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:08.540
Botnet C&amp;C Design is, how can
the bots contact their master safely?

00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:11.440
In other words,
in a stealthy and robust way.

00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:15.980
And as we have just discussed,
a naive approach is not adequate.

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:19.520
For example, if we have
hard-coded the malware to include

00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:22.840
a single IP address of our
command control server,

00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:28.055
then when this IP address has been
identified by security admins.

00:00:28.055 --> 00:00:31.665
The network admins such
as admins in the ISP

00:00:31.665 --> 00:00:34.485
can block all traffic to this server.

00:00:34.485 --> 00:00:36.725
Therefore, no command
control traffic for

00:00:36.725 --> 00:00:40.392
the bots can be reached to
the file master's server.

00:00:40.392 --> 00:00:43.532
And as a result,
the whole botnet's intercepted.

00:00:43.532 --> 00:00:47.832
For example, if all the bots come to
a single IP address that's hard-coded in

00:00:47.832 --> 00:00:53.472
the bot malware, then when this IP
address is identified by secured admins,

00:00:53.472 --> 00:00:59.190
the network admins, for example those at
ISP, can block all traffic to this IP.

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:01.770
Therefore, blocking all
command control traffic and

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:04.569
disrupting the operations of the botnet.

00:01:04.569 --> 00:01:08.820
And because such naive approach
is not stealthy nor robust,

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:13.290
it is only used by script-kiddies and
first-time malware authors.

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:17.850
In addition to safety, utility is
also very important to the Botmaster.

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:22.290
In other words, a Botmaster wants
efficient and reliable communications,

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:27.770
so that he can reach and coordinate
enough bots to perform a specific task.

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:30.860
So to summarize the design
considerations of Botnet C&amp;C,

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:35.120
the Botmaster would want efficient and
reliable communication.

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:40.250
That is the ability to reach a sizable
set of bots within certain time limit.

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:44.940
Stealthy communication, so
that it is hard to detect C&amp;C traffic.

00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:49.440
Resilient or robust communication, so
that it is very hard to disable or

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:51.446
block C&amp;C traffic.
