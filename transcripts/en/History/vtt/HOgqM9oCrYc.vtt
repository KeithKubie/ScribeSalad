00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:02.040
[music playing]

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:05.380
NARRATOR: September,
2003, Clemson University,

00:00:05.380 --> 00:00:07.500
South Carolina.

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:11.670
Dr. Thomas Boland files
the first patent for inkjet

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:15.040
3D printing of viable cells.

00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:18.540
Already a multi-billion
dollar industry,

00:00:18.540 --> 00:00:22.710
this process involves
placing biological materials

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:26.670
into modified ink cartridges
and printing onto bio

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:29.880
paper made of soy and collagen.

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:32.670
What we see is little
Petri dishes with a culture

00:00:32.670 --> 00:00:34.420
medium like agar in them.

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:36.330
And then you have a little
nozzle that comes over

00:00:36.330 --> 00:00:40.420
and spray paints these little
hexagons onto the agar.

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:44.250
And within only a few minutes,
they start growing cells,

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:47.420
and they become these
brown spots, which are

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:51.540
the beginnings of human livers.

00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:53.080
NIC RADFORD: Dr.
Boland has some very

00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:57.540
interesting research looking
at printing cell tissue.

00:00:57.540 --> 00:01:02.380
I think that opens up some very
interesting ideas about how

00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:04.750
to bio-manufacture things.

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:06.620
At some point, it
will have application

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:08.620
in the field of
robotics, especially

00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:12.790
as we start combining
devices with the human body.

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:21.210
NARRATOR: Many believe this is
the first step in constructing

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:24.040
engineered human organs.

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:28.710
Ultimately, the goal is to do
the same for every other part

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:30.790
of the human body.

00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:34.120
But there is a movement to
go much further in merging

00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:36.960
biology with technology.

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:41.040
It is called transhumanism.

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:43.290
The ultimate goal
of the transhumanists

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:46.920
is to become an immortal god.

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:48.790
And literally,
these people believe

00:01:48.790 --> 00:01:54.120
that they will merge with
technology and become cyborgs.

00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:56.290
They believe that
they will unlock

00:01:56.290 --> 00:02:00.250
the immortality,
anti-aging systems encoded

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:02.120
into the human
race, and that that

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:06.000
will be the supposed final
evolution of human beings

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:07.830
as they ascend into godhood.

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:13.500
NARRATOR: Some experts
believe that by the year

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:19.460
2050 scientists and engineers
will have unlocked the secrets

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:24.330
of immortality through the
production of artificial organs

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:27.540
and silicone-based structures.

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:30.120
Ancient astronaut
theorists suggest

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:33.040
that, considering the fact
that we are experimenting

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:38.170
with transhumanism today, it is
very possible a more advanced

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:40.670
extraterrestrial
race has already

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:46.040
achieved similar
technological advancements.

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:50.040
A civilization millions of
years older than us could have

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:52.830
actually evolved
much beyond the baby

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:56.210
steps that we're
taking right now.

00:02:56.210 --> 00:02:57.790
GIORGIO TSOUKALOS:
If we are doing this,

00:02:57.790 --> 00:03:01.170
is it possible that another
civilization has done

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:04.540
the same thing, but
perhaps thousands,

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:08.830
if not hundreds of thousands
of years before us?

00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:13.540
When we look at some of these
ancient texts that we have,

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:16.250
we're always talking
about ancient astronauts

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:18.080
that came to visit us.

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:22.330
But what if we were
visited by machines?

00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:28.080
And so the idea then
arises, will we, ourselves,

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:31.000
be able to become cyborgs?

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:32.330
MARK DICE: Companies
have actually

00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:34.710
built what are called
narrow interfaces,

00:03:34.710 --> 00:03:39.420
where they have wired
computers into people's brains.

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:42.380
They believe that they can map
the entire human brain and all

00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:45.920
of the data that's stored
in it, and then replicate it

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:49.960
into an artificial, intelligent,
silicon-based system

00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:52.880
where it can then be stored
and essentially never die.

00:03:57.210 --> 00:04:00.460
NARRATOR: Is it possible that
an entirely non-biological

00:04:00.460 --> 00:04:04.290
being could have sentience?

00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:07.620
And if extraterrestrials
have been visiting Earth

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:11.790
for thousands of years, might
it be more likely that they are

00:04:11.790 --> 00:04:14.080
actually fully robotic beings?

00:04:17.710 --> 00:04:20.290
NICK POPE: Biological
entities may actually

00:04:20.290 --> 00:04:22.080
be a rarity in the cosmos.

00:04:22.080 --> 00:04:24.790
We may be largely
living in a universe

00:04:24.790 --> 00:04:28.120
where the real intelligences
out there, and perhaps

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:29.750
coming down here, are robots.

00:04:33.170 --> 00:04:37.120
There are some who believe
that machines may have already

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:41.790
achieved a level of intelligence
vastly in excess of our own

00:04:41.790 --> 00:04:46.170
and that they may be giving us a
trail of breadcrumbs to help us

00:04:46.170 --> 00:04:50.080
rebuild the technology that
would get us to become enough

00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:52.330
like them that we
could eventually

00:04:52.330 --> 00:04:55.670
be merged into their
society in some fashion.
