00:00:00.970 --> 00:00:01.550
Welcome back.

00:00:01.550 --> 00:00:03.460
We're now ready for Newton's
second law.

00:00:03.460 --> 00:00:05.970
And Newton's second law can
simply be stated-- and you've

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:12.310
probably seen this before as
force is equal to mass times

00:00:12.310 --> 00:00:13.100
acceleration.

00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:18.480
This is probably, if not the
most famous formula in all of

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:20.730
time or all of physics,
it's up there.

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:23.190
It's probably up there with
E equals mc squared.

00:00:23.190 --> 00:00:24.810
But that one's a little
bit more complicated.

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:26.030
So what does this tell us?

00:00:26.030 --> 00:00:29.550
This tells us that the force,
the net force upon an object,

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:33.520
is equal to the object's mass
times its acceleration.

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:35.490
So let's stay in the metric
system because most of what

00:00:35.490 --> 00:00:37.660
you'll do in physic class is in
the metric system, and that

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:40.160
tends to be because the metric
system makes more sense.

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:42.390
So let's say that I have
a 1 kilogram object.

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:50.430
So its mass is 1 kilogram.

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:53.450
And it's being pulled down
at-- let's say its

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:54.850
acceleration.

00:00:54.850 --> 00:01:01.040
It's being accelerated downward
at 9.8 meters per

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:02.290
second squared.

00:01:05.209 --> 00:01:06.850
These kind of units should be
familiar with you from all the

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:08.380
projectile motion problems.

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:11.380
So the force applied on that
object in order to get this

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:16.820
type of acceleration would be--
you just multiply mass

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:17.570
times acceleration.

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:25.610
The force would have had to be
9.8 kilogram times the meter.

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:26.250
kilogram.

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:29.540
times meter over
second square.

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:31.240
That's the force applied
on the object.

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:33.950
And you're saying, sal,
this is very messy.

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:36.340
I don't like writing kilogram
meters per second squared.

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:39.315
And you are in luck because
there is a unit and that unit

00:01:39.315 --> 00:01:40.450
is the Newton.

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:46.490
1 Newton is equal to 1 kilogram

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:49.400
meter per second squared.

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:57.740
So if I'm pulling down on an
object at 9.8 Newtons, that's

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:58.440
just this, right?

00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:00.340
This is 1 Newton.

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:05.050
If I'm pulling down at 9.8
Newtons on an object that is 1

00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:12.230
kilogram, its acceleration is
going to be 9.8 meters per

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:14.340
second squared down.

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:17.200
And notice I said the word down,
but I didn't write it

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:19.300
anywhere in the formula.

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:22.690
And I guess we can imply that
both force and acceleration

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:28.700
have direction by writing
this in the formula.

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:32.620
That force is a vector and
acceleration is a vector.

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:36.500
And so we could have written
9.8 Newtons-- I don't know.

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:38.250
You'll never see this
convention.

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:43.990
We could say Newtons down is
equal to 1 kilogram times 9.8

00:02:43.990 --> 00:02:47.340
meters per second down.

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:49.010
So what can we do with
this formula?

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:54.300
Well we can solve problems.
So let's say

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:55.490
that I have an object.

00:02:55.490 --> 00:02:58.350
So my object weighs--
not weighs.

00:02:58.350 --> 00:03:00.400
The mass of my object.

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:03.190
And I'll differentiate between
weight and mass in a second.

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:07.110
Let's say the mass of some
object is-- I don't know-- 50

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:12.085
kilograms. That's how much a
normal person might weigh or a

00:03:12.085 --> 00:03:13.480
light person.

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:19.300
Mass weighs 50 kilograms. And
let's say we're in an inertial

00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:20.100
frame of reference.

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:23.390
We're in deep space, so we don't
have all these other--

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:26.130
the force of wind and
the force of gravity

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:27.380
acting on us, et cetera.

00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:34.260
My force, let's say I apply
it to the right.

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:36.530
So we know that force
is a vector.

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:43.686
Let's say I apply a force of--
I don't know-- 100 Newtons.

00:03:43.686 --> 00:03:45.400
And let's say I apply
it to the right.

00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:56.820
So this is the object, 50
kilograms. And I'm applying a

00:03:56.820 --> 00:04:02.220
force to the right
of 100 Newtons.

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:05.060
So what's going to happen
to this object?

00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:07.410
Well, let's use the formula.

00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:12.640
Force is equal to mass
times acceleration.

00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:14.790
The force is 100 Newtons.

00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:18.730
100 Newtons is equal
to the mass.

00:04:18.730 --> 00:04:24.260
The mass is 50 kilograms.
50 kilograms times the

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:26.700
acceleration.

00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:33.830
So we can divide both sides by
50 and you get 100 Newtons

00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:40.580
over 50 kilograms is equal
to the acceleration.

00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:42.930
And it's 100 Newtons
to the right.

00:04:42.930 --> 00:04:43.950
I'll use this little
arrow here.

00:04:43.950 --> 00:04:46.160
That's not a traditional
convention, but that's how we

00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:47.220
know it's to the right.

00:04:47.220 --> 00:04:48.770
So it's 100 divided by 50.

00:04:48.770 --> 00:04:51.150
So it's 2.

00:04:51.150 --> 00:04:56.010
We get this weird units here,
Newtons per kilogram is equal

00:04:56.010 --> 00:04:58.250
to the acceleration
to the right.

00:04:58.250 --> 00:04:59.590
This is also going to be to
the right because the

00:04:59.590 --> 00:05:02.380
direction of the force is going
to be the same as the

00:05:02.380 --> 00:05:04.540
direction of the acceleration.

00:05:04.540 --> 00:05:06.400
So what is this, 2 Newtons
per kilogram?

00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:09.210
Well, if you remember-- well you
could just guess that the

00:05:09.210 --> 00:05:10.730
unit of acceleration is meters
per second squared.

00:05:10.730 --> 00:05:12.590
But let's show that this
simplifies to that.

00:05:12.590 --> 00:05:15.060
So we said earlier that-- let
me just switch colors.

00:05:15.060 --> 00:05:22.270
That a Newton is kilogram meter
per second squared.

00:05:22.270 --> 00:05:27.470
And we're taking this Newton
over this kilogram over

00:05:27.470 --> 00:05:29.140
kilogram, right?

00:05:29.140 --> 00:05:31.680
So that will cancel out with
that and you get meters per

00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:32.850
second squared.

00:05:32.850 --> 00:05:35.900
And you wouldn't have to do this
on a test. Essentially,

00:05:35.900 --> 00:05:37.690
if you did everything right, you
would know that the unit

00:05:37.690 --> 00:05:40.000
acceleration is meters
per second squared.

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:42.170
So you would have the
acceleration-- I'm just

00:05:42.170 --> 00:05:46.620
switching the two sides--
is equal to 2

00:05:46.620 --> 00:05:50.000
meters per second squared.

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:51.250
And it'll be to the right.

00:05:54.600 --> 00:05:55.630
So that's useful.

00:05:55.630 --> 00:06:00.720
We just figured out based on how
hard I push something, how

00:06:00.720 --> 00:06:03.760
fast it's going to accelerate
while I push it.

00:06:03.760 --> 00:06:04.990
And you could use the
same formula to

00:06:04.990 --> 00:06:05.850
figure out other things.

00:06:05.850 --> 00:06:11.820
Let's say I know that an object
is accelerating-- let's

00:06:11.820 --> 00:06:16.430
say my acceleration is
3 meters per second

00:06:16.430 --> 00:06:18.600
squared to the right.

00:06:18.600 --> 00:06:20.910
Let's say to the left, just
to switch things.

00:06:20.910 --> 00:06:26.880
And let's say that I know the
force being applied on it is--

00:06:26.880 --> 00:06:31.950
I don't know-- 30 Newtons
to the left.

00:06:31.950 --> 00:06:33.520
And I want to figure
out the mass.

00:06:33.520 --> 00:06:34.520
Well you use the same thing.

00:06:34.520 --> 00:06:39.740
You say force, 30 Newtons to
the left is equal to mass

00:06:39.740 --> 00:06:41.440
times acceleration.

00:06:41.440 --> 00:06:45.530
Times 3 meters per second
squared to the left.

00:06:45.530 --> 00:06:49.660
Divide both sides by the 3
meters per second and you get

00:06:49.660 --> 00:06:54.370
30 Newtons over 3 meters
per second squared is

00:06:54.370 --> 00:06:56.030
equal to the mass.

00:06:56.030 --> 00:06:59.520
30 divided by 3 is 10.

00:06:59.520 --> 00:07:02.050
You can figure out that Newtons
is kilogram meters per

00:07:02.050 --> 00:07:02.750
second squared.

00:07:02.750 --> 00:07:05.370
So you're just left with
10 kilograms is

00:07:05.370 --> 00:07:07.580
equal to the mass.

00:07:07.580 --> 00:07:10.590
It's very important that if you
see a problem where the

00:07:10.590 --> 00:07:14.060
answer's given in-- I don't
know-- kilometers per second

00:07:14.060 --> 00:07:17.410
squared or you know, instead of
giving it in kilograms it's

00:07:17.410 --> 00:07:20.110
giving it in grams or decagrams,
you should convert

00:07:20.110 --> 00:07:24.360
back to kilograms or meters just
so you make sure you're

00:07:24.360 --> 00:07:25.210
using the right units.

00:07:25.210 --> 00:07:27.180
And that tends to be frankly,
I think, the

00:07:27.180 --> 00:07:28.120
hardest thing for people.

00:07:28.120 --> 00:07:32.750
And we'll do all of that when
we tackle harder problems.

00:07:32.750 --> 00:07:35.020
I think now is a good time back
to actually differentiate

00:07:35.020 --> 00:07:37.220
between mass and weight.

00:07:37.220 --> 00:07:39.340
And you've probably thought the
two were interchangeable,

00:07:39.340 --> 00:07:40.710
but they're not.

00:07:40.710 --> 00:07:46.100
Mass is how much of an
object there is.

00:07:46.100 --> 00:07:48.440
You can almost view it as how
much of the stuff there is or

00:07:48.440 --> 00:07:50.300
you can almost it view it--
how many atoms there are.

00:07:50.300 --> 00:07:51.435
But even atoms have mass.

00:07:51.435 --> 00:07:54.050
So just how much
stuff there is.

00:07:54.050 --> 00:07:57.530
And another way to view mass is,
how much does the object

00:07:57.530 --> 00:07:58.880
resist change?

00:07:58.880 --> 00:08:02.250
And that actually falls
out of F equals ma.

00:08:02.250 --> 00:08:07.260
Because if our mass is bigger,
it's going to take a lot more

00:08:07.260 --> 00:08:09.220
force to make it accelerate
a certain amount.

00:08:09.220 --> 00:08:11.760
If the mass is smaller it'll
take less force.

00:08:11.760 --> 00:08:15.340
So mass can be viewed as how
much stuff there is, of an

00:08:15.340 --> 00:08:16.400
object there is.

00:08:16.400 --> 00:08:20.440
Or you can view it as how hard
is it to change what that

00:08:20.440 --> 00:08:21.040
object is doing.

00:08:21.040 --> 00:08:24.480
If it's stationary, how hard
is it to accelerate it?

00:08:24.480 --> 00:08:27.190
If it's moving, how hard
is it to maybe stop it?

00:08:27.190 --> 00:08:28.930
Which would essentially
be decelerating.

00:08:28.930 --> 00:08:31.400
How hard is it to accelerate
an object?

00:08:31.400 --> 00:08:35.600
Weight is actually how much
is-- what is the force of

00:08:35.600 --> 00:08:37.650
earth upon an object?

00:08:37.650 --> 00:08:39.840
So you're weight would actually
change if you go from

00:08:39.840 --> 00:08:42.600
one planet to another because
the force of gravity changes.

00:08:42.600 --> 00:08:46.760
So your weight is 1/6 on the
moon as it is on earth because

00:08:46.760 --> 00:08:48.310
the pull of gravity is 1/6.

00:08:48.310 --> 00:08:49.450
But your mass doesn't change.

00:08:49.450 --> 00:08:51.810
There's still the same amount
of Sal on earth as

00:08:51.810 --> 00:08:54.400
there is on the moon.

00:08:54.400 --> 00:08:57.550
So your weight really-- when you
ask someone in Europe and

00:08:57.550 --> 00:08:59.950
they say hey, you know, I weigh
50 kilograms. You should

00:08:59.950 --> 00:09:03.190
say, no, you don't weigh 50
kilograms. You weigh whatever

00:09:03.190 --> 00:09:04.870
50 times 9.8 is.

00:09:04.870 --> 00:09:08.890
That's like 400 something--
you weigh

00:09:08.890 --> 00:09:11.860
490 Newtons or something.

00:09:11.860 --> 00:09:14.450
This is mass.

00:09:14.450 --> 00:09:17.400
And it's interesting because in
the English system, and all

00:09:17.400 --> 00:09:18.860
of us Americans, we use
the English system.

00:09:18.860 --> 00:09:21.790
When we say that we weigh 10
pounds, we're actually using

00:09:21.790 --> 00:09:25.680
the correct terminology
because pounds

00:09:25.680 --> 00:09:28.730
are a unit of force.

00:09:28.730 --> 00:09:32.390
We're saying, if I weigh-- and
I do weigh about 150 pounds.

00:09:32.390 --> 00:09:33.940
That means the earth is this
pulling on me with

00:09:33.940 --> 00:09:36.280
150 pounds of force.

00:09:36.280 --> 00:09:39.770
And actually, turns out that
my mass is measured in the

00:09:39.770 --> 00:09:41.880
unit called a slug, which
we might discuss later.

00:09:41.880 --> 00:09:43.485
Actually, we'll do some problems
where we do it in the
