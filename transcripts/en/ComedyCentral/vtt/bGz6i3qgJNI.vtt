a bunch of assholes,

00:00:07.574 --> 00:00:09.542
I put up with this
shit long enough.

00:00:09.542 --> 00:00:11.244
You haven't paid
rent in four months

00:00:11.244 --> 00:00:12.979 align:start size:84% position:16%
You broke down your
own door 'cause

00:00:12.979 --> 00:00:14.247
you locked yourself out again.

00:00:14.247 --> 00:00:17.017
You stole a neighbors
dog, it had a collar!

00:00:17.017 --> 00:00:18.451
- We said sorry about that

00:00:18.451 --> 00:00:20.286 align:start size:94% position:6%
- This is the last straw,
get me the money by

00:00:20.286 --> 00:00:22.622

00:01:13.073 --> 00:01:14.307

give 'em a note.

00:01:22.348 --> 00:01:23.817
Give them a note
