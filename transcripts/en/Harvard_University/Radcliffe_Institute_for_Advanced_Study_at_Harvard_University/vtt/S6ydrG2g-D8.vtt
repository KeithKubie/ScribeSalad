00:00:00.996 --> 00:00:03.486
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:10.820
- Welcome back, everybody.

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:13.260
So now we're going to hear
from two young investigators.

00:00:13.260 --> 00:00:15.580
So the first will
be Sonja Swanson

00:00:15.580 --> 00:00:18.580
who's an assistant professor in
the Department of Epidemiology

00:00:18.580 --> 00:00:23.110
at the Erasmus Medical Center
in Rotterdam, the Netherlands.

00:00:23.110 --> 00:00:25.630
She also holds an adjunct
affiliation with us

00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:29.110
at the Harvard Chan
School of Public Health.

00:00:29.110 --> 00:00:32.170
A lot of her work is on
estimating causal effects

00:00:32.170 --> 00:00:34.450
in epidemiology, so a
little bit of a continuation

00:00:34.450 --> 00:00:36.820
of this theme, but in
the particular domain

00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:42.440
of neuropsychiatric disorders
and related health outcomes

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:45.160
and has a particular interest
in prevention and treatment

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:46.450
strategies.

00:00:46.450 --> 00:00:49.630
And so she's going to talk about
biological and social processes

00:00:49.630 --> 00:00:52.840
underlying mental health, and
how epidemiologists can help

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:55.810
articulate
patient-centered questions

00:00:55.810 --> 00:00:59.250
and combine appropriate data and
analyzes to try to answer them.

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:01.270
And then we'll hear
from John Jackson, who's

00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:03.880
assistant professor who
holds a dual appointment

00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:07.690
in epidemiology and mental
health at Johns Hopkins.

00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:11.740
His methods research focuses
on identifying, refining,

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:15.430
and evaluating interventions
to eliminate health and health

00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:18.940
care disparities, and
developing methods

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:23.310
to improve the transparency and
conduct of occupational studies

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:25.510
and post hoc analyzes
of clinical trials.

00:01:25.510 --> 00:01:28.060
That's after the clinical
trial is done and you go back

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:31.210
and you mine it for data
that wasn't necessarily

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:35.500
the focus of the
randomized intervention.

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:39.250
His work focuses on
understanding and reducing

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:41.680
the excess morbidity and
mortality in patients

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:45.310
with mental illness using
state of the art methods

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:47.380
to provide insight
about effectiveness

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:49.720
of potential interventions.

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:52.480
And today's talk will focus,
I think in particular,

00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:57.324
on reducing health
disparities in this domain.

00:01:57.324 --> 00:01:58.740
And I'll leave it
at that thought.

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:01.050
Why don't you guys come on up.

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:03.395
[APPLAUSE]

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:07.070
- Great.

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:09.389
So thank you so much
for having me here.

00:02:09.389 --> 00:02:11.160
I'm thrilled to be
part of this event.

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:13.730
And I just want to thank
the Radcliffe Institute

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:16.010
in particular for
hosting not just today's

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:19.160
event, but this entire series.

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:21.350
So as Janet mentioned,
I'm going to be talking

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:24.050
about the epidemiology of
neurological and psychiatric

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:26.930
disorders, and I wanted
to start with just

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:30.745
going through what I see as the
big questions in this field.

00:02:30.745 --> 00:02:32.870
And these are probably not
unlike the big questions

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:36.060
in any sort of subfield
of epidemiology.

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:39.590
So we want to know, how many
people suffer from dementia?

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:42.290
Who is at highest risk
of bipolar disorder?

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:44.270
How can we prevent
schizophrenia?

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:46.190
How can we treat depression?

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:48.170
How can we reduce the
negative consequences

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:49.940
of eating disorders?

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:51.740
And so these are the
big kinds of questions

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:54.154
that motivated me to
get into epidemiology,

00:02:54.154 --> 00:02:56.570
and the kinds of questions
that underlie a lot of the work

00:02:56.570 --> 00:03:00.692
that I do and my colleagues
do across the world.

00:03:00.692 --> 00:03:02.900
However, a lot of the work--
as Janet kind of alluded

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:05.330
to already-- that I work
on is actually also getting

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:06.650
into the methods of this.

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:09.680
So not just how do we answer
these questions, but how

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:10.920
do we answer them better.

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:14.610
How do we improve the ways
that we answer these questions.

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:17.270
I didn't want this to be a
very mathematical talk, though,

00:03:17.270 --> 00:03:19.895
so what I'm going to do is kind
of go through a little bit more

00:03:19.895 --> 00:03:23.560
of the philosophy of doing
that in a sound manner.

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:25.490
And in particular, I
want to try to walk us

00:03:25.490 --> 00:03:29.340
through a couple of steps
in this scientific process.

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:32.120
So how do we start with one
of those really big questions

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:34.180
and try to tackle that?

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:36.680
And what we want to do is we
have to distill it down to some

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:40.460
more precise, more manageable,
but still quite relevant

00:03:40.460 --> 00:03:41.750
questions.

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:44.210
And once we have a more
precise question stated,

00:03:44.210 --> 00:03:46.430
we can go on to collect
and analyze data,

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:49.340
to obtain some answer
to that question,

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:51.290
and then discuss
the results of that

00:03:51.290 --> 00:03:53.450
as transparently as we can.

00:03:53.450 --> 00:03:55.820
Now the last up iteration
I just want to underscore

00:03:55.820 --> 00:03:57.170
is really important here.

00:03:57.170 --> 00:03:59.160
Science is a process.

00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:01.340
It's not an end
result. I'm not going

00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:03.460
to talk as much about the
iteration part of this,

00:04:03.460 --> 00:04:06.230
but I just want us to be mindful
that this sometimes means going

00:04:06.230 --> 00:04:08.210
back up to that big question.

00:04:08.210 --> 00:04:10.510
Sometimes refining
our sub-question,

00:04:10.510 --> 00:04:14.220
sometimes collecting new
data, sometimes re-analyzing

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:18.070
and reinterpreting the
results of that data.

00:04:18.070 --> 00:04:20.760
And so what I'm going to do
is go through this process

00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:22.950
together with two
questions that I've kind of

00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:24.880
worked with in my research.

00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:26.610
And the first big
question I want to ask

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:29.100
is just, how many
adolescents in the US

00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:30.630
actually have an
eating disorder?

00:04:30.630 --> 00:04:35.560
How would we try to obtain an
estimate for this question?

00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:38.639
Now before I go into making
that a more precise question,

00:04:38.639 --> 00:04:40.180
I want to give just
a little bit more

00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:42.280
background on eating
disorders for those that

00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:44.290
are less familiar with them.

00:04:44.290 --> 00:04:47.140
So traditionally, there were
two types of eating disorders

00:04:47.140 --> 00:04:50.650
that were recognized by
medical professionals, anorexia

00:04:50.650 --> 00:04:52.384
and bulimia nervosa.

00:04:52.384 --> 00:04:53.800
There's specific
criteria that you

00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:57.194
need to meet in order to get a
diagnosis of either of these.

00:04:57.194 --> 00:04:59.110
I'm not going to go
through all the specifics,

00:04:59.110 --> 00:05:01.210
but essentially anorexia
is characterized

00:05:01.210 --> 00:05:03.430
by this low weight,
fear of weight gain,

00:05:03.430 --> 00:05:05.620
and a disturbance in how
one experiences their shape

00:05:05.620 --> 00:05:06.860
and weight.

00:05:06.860 --> 00:05:10.300
Whereas bulimia is characterized
by having binge eating,

00:05:10.300 --> 00:05:12.790
so overeating with
loss of control,

00:05:12.790 --> 00:05:17.290
and compensatory behaviors
such as self-induced vomiting.

00:05:17.290 --> 00:05:20.830
More recently there was another
eating disorder recognized,

00:05:20.830 --> 00:05:23.560
a binge eating disorder, and
then everything else kind of

00:05:23.560 --> 00:05:26.890
falls under this other category,
this catchall, not otherwise

00:05:26.890 --> 00:05:30.610
specified diagnosis for
eating disorders that don't

00:05:30.610 --> 00:05:33.370
meet these strict criteria.

00:05:33.370 --> 00:05:36.029
So one thing to keep in mind
is that with eating disorders

00:05:36.029 --> 00:05:38.320
the majority of patients that
present for care actually

00:05:38.320 --> 00:05:42.800
fall under this not
otherwise specified category.

00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:45.560
So with that in mind, let's
go back to our big question--

00:05:45.560 --> 00:05:48.104
how many adolescents in the
US have an eating disorder--

00:05:48.104 --> 00:05:49.520
and try to distill
it to some more

00:05:49.520 --> 00:05:51.900
precise manageable questions.

00:05:51.900 --> 00:05:54.770
And here I think it's important
to think through our motivation

00:05:54.770 --> 00:05:57.420
for asking that question
in the first place.

00:05:57.420 --> 00:05:59.690
So one possible
motivation is that we're

00:05:59.690 --> 00:06:03.170
trying to get some estimate
at how many individuals would

00:06:03.170 --> 00:06:05.490
benefit from some sort of care.

00:06:05.490 --> 00:06:07.250
And this is already
sort of fuzzy.

00:06:07.250 --> 00:06:09.390
This is not a precise
enough question yet,

00:06:09.390 --> 00:06:10.790
but this gets at
the idea that we

00:06:10.790 --> 00:06:13.640
might want to know about any
eating disorder, or maybe even

00:06:13.640 --> 00:06:15.730
anyone with a symptom
of an eating disorder.

00:06:15.730 --> 00:06:18.230
And that's the kind of number
that we're kind of setting out

00:06:18.230 --> 00:06:20.066
to get.

00:06:20.066 --> 00:06:21.440
Another possibility
is that we're

00:06:21.440 --> 00:06:23.570
interested in getting the
proportion of individuals

00:06:23.570 --> 00:06:25.220
with one of the
specific subtypes

00:06:25.220 --> 00:06:27.810
or a couple different
listed subtypes.

00:06:27.810 --> 00:06:30.410
So we might want to know how
many have anorexia or bulimia,

00:06:30.410 --> 00:06:32.540
for example.

00:06:32.540 --> 00:06:35.374
And then finally, another reason
we might be motivated for this

00:06:35.374 --> 00:06:36.790
is that we're
trying to understand

00:06:36.790 --> 00:06:40.150
how to allocate resources
for care as it's currently

00:06:40.150 --> 00:06:41.172
being sought.

00:06:41.172 --> 00:06:42.880
And in this case, we
wouldn't necessarily

00:06:42.880 --> 00:06:44.620
want to know how
many individuals

00:06:44.620 --> 00:06:49.130
have an eating disorder, but
how many seek treatment for it.

00:06:49.130 --> 00:06:50.589
So when I put
these side by side,

00:06:50.589 --> 00:06:52.880
hopefully it's obvious that
they're different questions

00:06:52.880 --> 00:06:55.070
and we're going to get
different answers to them.

00:06:55.070 --> 00:06:56.540
And that'd be true
if we did this

00:06:56.540 --> 00:06:58.190
with any other
psychiatric disorder.

00:06:58.190 --> 00:07:00.650
That'd be true if we did
this with cancer, with HIV,

00:07:00.650 --> 00:07:02.710
or anything else.

00:07:02.710 --> 00:07:04.840
One of the challenges in
psychiatric disorders,

00:07:04.840 --> 00:07:06.940
though, is that there
can be huge differences

00:07:06.940 --> 00:07:09.130
between these three questions.

00:07:09.130 --> 00:07:11.620
That's a very different
issue between A and B

00:07:11.620 --> 00:07:13.690
there because of
these fuzzy boundaries

00:07:13.690 --> 00:07:16.300
of what the definitions
of our disorders are,

00:07:16.300 --> 00:07:18.430
and there's a huge
difference between B and C

00:07:18.430 --> 00:07:20.110
because there's
a lot of barriers

00:07:20.110 --> 00:07:25.820
to treatment like stigma, having
a lack of insurance coverage,

00:07:25.820 --> 00:07:27.370
and so on.

00:07:27.370 --> 00:07:28.750
And so actually
in work that I've

00:07:28.750 --> 00:07:30.708
done trying to answer
these questions with some

00:07:30.708 --> 00:07:34.150
of my colleagues, we get
very different estimates.

00:07:34.150 --> 00:07:37.900
We'd say that something like 1
in 10 for the first question,

00:07:37.900 --> 00:07:41.170
1 in 100 for the second
question, and one in 1,000

00:07:41.170 --> 00:07:42.250
for the third.

00:07:42.250 --> 00:07:46.670
So just absolutely
enormous differences here.

00:07:46.670 --> 00:07:49.062
Now, again, you might say,
of course they're different.

00:07:49.062 --> 00:07:50.270
I see that they're different.

00:07:50.270 --> 00:07:52.710
This is the end
of the story here.

00:07:52.710 --> 00:07:54.500
But part of the
process of science

00:07:54.500 --> 00:07:56.660
is understanding where
these numbers get used

00:07:56.660 --> 00:07:58.840
for the next question we ask.

00:07:58.840 --> 00:08:00.860
So if we're asking
who is at highest risk

00:08:00.860 --> 00:08:02.630
for eating disorder,
it's important

00:08:02.630 --> 00:08:04.190
that we know which
kind of category

00:08:04.190 --> 00:08:07.880
we're starting to dissect from.

00:08:07.880 --> 00:08:11.180
In particular, if we turn to
research as it was historically

00:08:11.180 --> 00:08:14.120
done in eating disorders,
most of the research

00:08:14.120 --> 00:08:16.820
was done in just clinical
or specialty care settings.

00:08:16.820 --> 00:08:18.680
So they were only
recruiting patients

00:08:18.680 --> 00:08:20.720
from these settings
who by definition were

00:08:20.720 --> 00:08:22.287
seeking treatment.

00:08:22.287 --> 00:08:23.870
What this means is
that we were really

00:08:23.870 --> 00:08:26.619
missing the full picture of
who is most vulnerable to have

00:08:26.619 --> 00:08:27.410
an eating disorder.

00:08:27.410 --> 00:08:30.109
We were missing
out on who actually

00:08:30.109 --> 00:08:32.150
has an eating disorder,
because we were actually,

00:08:32.150 --> 00:08:34.880
by definition, looking at who
is most likely to seek care

00:08:34.880 --> 00:08:36.309
for it.

00:08:36.309 --> 00:08:37.850
And so what I want
to do next is just

00:08:37.850 --> 00:08:39.710
go through some
misconceptions that

00:08:39.710 --> 00:08:43.256
followed from that line of
research, and many of these

00:08:43.256 --> 00:08:44.630
are probably
familiar to you when

00:08:44.630 --> 00:08:48.590
you think of the prototypical
eating disorder patient.

00:08:48.590 --> 00:08:51.590
So first, it's been
kind of long thought

00:08:51.590 --> 00:08:54.380
that eating disorders
don't affect males.

00:08:54.380 --> 00:08:57.110
Indeed, when we look at
treatment seeking samples,

00:08:57.110 --> 00:08:58.880
it's almost a 10 to 1 ratio.

00:08:58.880 --> 00:09:00.890
And this is such a
predominant belief

00:09:00.890 --> 00:09:02.970
that's quoted in most
medical textbooks.

00:09:02.970 --> 00:09:06.170
It's quoted in the
DSM, and this is really

00:09:06.170 --> 00:09:08.224
this propagated belief.

00:09:08.224 --> 00:09:10.390
When we look at some of the
community-based samples,

00:09:10.390 --> 00:09:13.835
however, the ratio of females
to males is closer to two

00:09:13.835 --> 00:09:14.780
to three to one.

00:09:14.780 --> 00:09:16.910
And for some of the
specific subtypes,

00:09:16.910 --> 00:09:19.070
it's actually close to 1 to 1.

00:09:19.070 --> 00:09:21.330
So yes, they may affect
females more generally,

00:09:21.330 --> 00:09:23.540
but there's such a
bigger discrepancy

00:09:23.540 --> 00:09:25.400
in terms of the
treatment-seeking numbers

00:09:25.400 --> 00:09:29.150
than the
community-based numbers.

00:09:29.150 --> 00:09:30.440
The same could be true--

00:09:30.440 --> 00:09:34.790
said for minorities for
looking across Western cultures

00:09:34.790 --> 00:09:36.500
versus non-western
cultures, looking

00:09:36.500 --> 00:09:38.930
across socioeconomic status.

00:09:38.930 --> 00:09:42.740
So when we look at who
actually in a community sample

00:09:42.740 --> 00:09:45.470
meets criteria for
an eating disorder,

00:09:45.470 --> 00:09:47.180
there aren't as
big of differences

00:09:47.180 --> 00:09:51.780
as we get in the
treatment-seeking samples.

00:09:51.780 --> 00:09:54.240
And then finally, based on
treatment-seeking samples,

00:09:54.240 --> 00:09:57.090
we tend to believe that
eating disorders onset in late

00:09:57.090 --> 00:09:59.260
adolescence or early adulthood.

00:09:59.260 --> 00:10:02.280
This is actually more
in line with when

00:10:02.280 --> 00:10:04.710
they start seeking
care, but the symptoms

00:10:04.710 --> 00:10:06.925
may start occurring
many years before.

00:10:06.925 --> 00:10:08.550
And so this just
underscores that we're

00:10:08.550 --> 00:10:11.370
missing an opportunity
to intervene much earlier

00:10:11.370 --> 00:10:14.640
in the process based on this
kind of misinterpretation

00:10:14.640 --> 00:10:15.170
of the data.

00:10:17.690 --> 00:10:19.400
Now another thing
to keep in mind

00:10:19.400 --> 00:10:22.010
when we are trying to
refine our question

00:10:22.010 --> 00:10:24.020
is to think about when
we're asking about.

00:10:24.020 --> 00:10:26.750
In particular, when we're
thinking about specific eating

00:10:26.750 --> 00:10:28.740
disorders subtypes.

00:10:28.740 --> 00:10:30.950
So I know this is a
very colorful graph,

00:10:30.950 --> 00:10:35.840
but just to orient you each row
represents a particular patient

00:10:35.840 --> 00:10:38.480
who at the beginning of
the 12 year follow-up

00:10:38.480 --> 00:10:41.910
met criteria for one
specific eating disorder.

00:10:41.910 --> 00:10:45.260
And so if we look across just
one particular row, every time

00:10:45.260 --> 00:10:47.210
we see the color
change in that row that

00:10:47.210 --> 00:10:50.570
means that the diagnosis that
we would give to that patient

00:10:50.570 --> 00:10:53.220
at that moment in
time would change.

00:10:53.220 --> 00:10:55.820
And so if you wanted to get an
estimate of how many patients

00:10:55.820 --> 00:10:58.220
have anorexia in
this sample, you

00:10:58.220 --> 00:11:00.350
get very different estimates
if you looked at one

00:11:00.350 --> 00:11:03.830
particular time, or if you
asked about their entire history

00:11:03.830 --> 00:11:05.589
or just the past year.

00:11:05.589 --> 00:11:07.130
And so this is just
something we have

00:11:07.130 --> 00:11:10.160
to be mindful of when we're
asking these kinds of questions

00:11:10.160 --> 00:11:12.050
is what is the precise
question that we're

00:11:12.050 --> 00:11:13.760
trying to obtain from our data.

00:11:17.470 --> 00:11:19.690
So then let's go back
to our step-by-step.

00:11:19.690 --> 00:11:22.480
We started with this
really big question,

00:11:22.480 --> 00:11:25.580
how many adolescents
have an eating disorder?

00:11:25.580 --> 00:11:28.270
And one possible way that we
could distill this question

00:11:28.270 --> 00:11:31.060
would be to ask, well, what
proportion of US adolescents

00:11:31.060 --> 00:11:34.891
have ever met criteria for
any eating disorder subtype?

00:11:34.891 --> 00:11:36.640
And then this, again,
is just one example.

00:11:36.640 --> 00:11:38.470
There's lots of other
questions that we

00:11:38.470 --> 00:11:41.140
could have asked as well.

00:11:41.140 --> 00:11:42.880
But with this question
in mind, then we

00:11:42.880 --> 00:11:45.160
can think about collecting
data and analyzing

00:11:45.160 --> 00:11:47.650
that data judiciously
to obtain our best

00:11:47.650 --> 00:11:50.000
answer to that question.

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:52.540
So I worked with the National
Co-morbidity Survey Adolescent

00:11:52.540 --> 00:11:57.130
Supplement, which was a survey
of about 10,000 US adolescents.

00:11:57.130 --> 00:12:00.160
And in doing interviews on
different eating disorders,

00:12:00.160 --> 00:12:03.850
we were able to obtain an
estimate of about 5% meeting

00:12:03.850 --> 00:12:06.730
criteria for the
subtypes we measured.

00:12:06.730 --> 00:12:08.980
Now I say on the slide
there that that's

00:12:08.980 --> 00:12:10.946
sort of a lower bound
estimate, and that's

00:12:10.946 --> 00:12:12.820
because we were very
mindful that we couldn't

00:12:12.820 --> 00:12:15.500
measure all types of subtypes.

00:12:15.500 --> 00:12:18.040
So when we discuss
the results, we've

00:12:18.040 --> 00:12:20.590
made clear that we were only
getting certain subtypes.

00:12:20.590 --> 00:12:24.550
We were being very clear about
the quality of our measurements

00:12:24.550 --> 00:12:26.257
and issues with
the measurements.

00:12:26.257 --> 00:12:28.090
But the point is that
we were putting it out

00:12:28.090 --> 00:12:30.459
there as a dialogue
to keep on refining.

00:12:30.459 --> 00:12:32.500
And indeed, since then
there's been a lot of work

00:12:32.500 --> 00:12:34.120
that I've been a
part of where we

00:12:34.120 --> 00:12:35.800
are able to measure
some of the subtypes

00:12:35.800 --> 00:12:38.350
that we didn't get and try
to get better triangulation

00:12:38.350 --> 00:12:41.090
of these estimates.

00:12:41.090 --> 00:12:44.780
So now I want to turn to a
different kind of big question,

00:12:44.780 --> 00:12:49.520
a causal question in a
sense, which is asking rather

00:12:49.520 --> 00:12:52.520
than just trying to count who
has an eating disorder, who

00:12:52.520 --> 00:12:55.400
meets criteria for these
different outcomes,

00:12:55.400 --> 00:12:56.970
we want to do
something about it.

00:12:56.970 --> 00:12:59.180
How could we prevent
an eating disorder?

00:12:59.180 --> 00:13:01.760
How could we treat eating
disorders in our populations?

00:13:01.760 --> 00:13:05.150
How could we reduce the
negative consequences of them?

00:13:05.150 --> 00:13:06.770
And I'm not going
to boil this down

00:13:06.770 --> 00:13:08.520
to one specific
sub-question, but I

00:13:08.520 --> 00:13:10.610
want to give just kind of
a feel of the philosophy

00:13:10.610 --> 00:13:15.614
of this causal inference
approach in these settings.

00:13:15.614 --> 00:13:17.030
So again, we're
going to try first

00:13:17.030 --> 00:13:23.100
to distill this down to a more
precise, relevant question.

00:13:23.100 --> 00:13:26.554
And as we heard in the
previous session, ideally

00:13:26.554 --> 00:13:27.970
we would have our
causal questions

00:13:27.970 --> 00:13:30.490
like this answered with
well-conducted, large,

00:13:30.490 --> 00:13:32.120
randomized trials.

00:13:32.120 --> 00:13:33.790
So if we were
interested in looking

00:13:33.790 --> 00:13:36.370
at an anti-bullying
campaign in schools,

00:13:36.370 --> 00:13:38.560
we would randomize
some schools to receive

00:13:38.560 --> 00:13:41.950
that campaign, some schools to
not, and follow that over time

00:13:41.950 --> 00:13:44.350
and see if mental health
improves in those schools.

00:13:44.350 --> 00:13:46.780
If we're interested in some
treatment for depression

00:13:46.780 --> 00:13:48.680
like a new therapy,
we'd want to randomize

00:13:48.680 --> 00:13:51.370
some patients to get it,
some patients to get standard

00:13:51.370 --> 00:13:52.330
of care--

00:13:52.330 --> 00:13:57.870
follow them over time
and see what is going on.

00:13:57.870 --> 00:14:00.350
There's a lot of times, though,
where our questions are not

00:14:00.350 --> 00:14:02.690
going to be feasibly
or ethically answered

00:14:02.690 --> 00:14:04.010
with randomized trials.

00:14:04.010 --> 00:14:05.940
And, in fact, for a lot
of pressing questions,

00:14:05.940 --> 00:14:07.850
we also just don't want
to necessarily wait

00:14:07.850 --> 00:14:09.770
for those trials to happen.

00:14:09.770 --> 00:14:11.510
It might take decades
before we really

00:14:11.510 --> 00:14:14.450
learned the long term
consequences of what

00:14:14.450 --> 00:14:20.390
happens to a fetus prenatally,
just as one example.

00:14:20.390 --> 00:14:22.580
And so because of
this, we have to rely

00:14:22.580 --> 00:14:23.754
on observational studies.

00:14:23.754 --> 00:14:25.670
And this comes back again
to some of the talks

00:14:25.670 --> 00:14:28.670
that we heard earlier where
we have to somehow rely

00:14:28.670 --> 00:14:32.645
on having our causal inferences
based on observational data.

00:14:32.645 --> 00:14:34.520
What this means is that
we need to have a way

00:14:34.520 --> 00:14:37.760
to link or observe data
to causal questions.

00:14:37.760 --> 00:14:40.310
We need some sort of formal
mathematical language

00:14:40.310 --> 00:14:45.050
for saying why our observed data
is linked to these questions

00:14:45.050 --> 00:14:46.882
that we're trying to ask.

00:14:46.882 --> 00:14:48.590
Now I don't want to
go into the specifics

00:14:48.590 --> 00:14:50.340
of these different
mathematical languages.

00:14:50.340 --> 00:14:52.210
There's a lot going on there.

00:14:52.210 --> 00:14:54.860
In fact, maybe that could be an
entire next in science series

00:14:54.860 --> 00:14:58.480
is just all the languages
of causal inference.

00:14:58.480 --> 00:15:00.230
But one of the
commonalities that comes up

00:15:00.230 --> 00:15:02.480
from really thinking
about these approaches

00:15:02.480 --> 00:15:04.910
is that in order to
estimate a causal effect,

00:15:04.910 --> 00:15:07.482
you have to have a precise
idea of the definition

00:15:07.482 --> 00:15:08.690
that you're trying to obtain.

00:15:08.690 --> 00:15:11.360
You have to know what
that starting question was

00:15:11.360 --> 00:15:13.324
as precisely as you can.

00:15:13.324 --> 00:15:14.990
Another way to think
of this is that you

00:15:14.990 --> 00:15:17.680
have to have a really good
idea of what the protocol is

00:15:17.680 --> 00:15:20.840
of that hypothetical trial you
wish you could have conducted

00:15:20.840 --> 00:15:24.060
and you're using the
observed data for instead.

00:15:24.060 --> 00:15:26.400
What we see is that if we
have ill-defined questions,

00:15:26.400 --> 00:15:28.032
we end up with
ill-defined answers.

00:15:28.032 --> 00:15:29.490
And so to the extent
that we really

00:15:29.490 --> 00:15:33.240
do want to prevent eating
disorders from onsetting

00:15:33.240 --> 00:15:37.200
or treat them better or improve
the lives of the patients who

00:15:37.200 --> 00:15:39.270
have it, it's really
fundamental that we

00:15:39.270 --> 00:15:43.380
start by making these
questions clear.

00:15:43.380 --> 00:15:46.220
So when we're thinking
about this step-by-step

00:15:46.220 --> 00:15:48.060
and we're trying to
take this big question

00:15:48.060 --> 00:15:50.390
and distill it down, I
think it's really important

00:15:50.390 --> 00:15:52.490
that we're mindful of
how we're distilling

00:15:52.490 --> 00:15:56.120
this down to manageable
but very precise questions.

00:15:56.120 --> 00:15:58.580
So what is that target trial
that we're trying to do?

00:15:58.580 --> 00:16:01.160
What is the protocol exactly?

00:16:01.160 --> 00:16:02.870
And then once
we've done that, we

00:16:02.870 --> 00:16:05.420
can think through how we're
going to collect and analyze

00:16:05.420 --> 00:16:07.742
data to answer that question.

00:16:07.742 --> 00:16:09.200
And that might mean
doing something

00:16:09.200 --> 00:16:11.900
like propensity score matching
or regression discontinuity

00:16:11.900 --> 00:16:12.920
as we heard earlier.

00:16:12.920 --> 00:16:16.160
That could be many other
kinds of statistical methods.

00:16:16.160 --> 00:16:18.800
But I think the other thing
we need to be mindful of

00:16:18.800 --> 00:16:21.710
is that these questions
or these analyses

00:16:21.710 --> 00:16:24.290
are always tied back
to that question--

00:16:24.290 --> 00:16:26.690
that there should be a
link between the analysis

00:16:26.690 --> 00:16:29.240
we did and the question
that we're trying to ask.

00:16:29.240 --> 00:16:32.090
And otherwise, we're
losing this opportunity

00:16:32.090 --> 00:16:34.119
where we have
counterproductive answers

00:16:34.119 --> 00:16:35.660
to questions that
we haven't actually

00:16:35.660 --> 00:16:39.370
asked with our studies.

00:16:39.370 --> 00:16:41.590
So with that in mind, I
wanted to just reflect

00:16:41.590 --> 00:16:45.070
a little bit on the future of
epidemiology, or at least some

00:16:45.070 --> 00:16:48.970
of the themes that I
really see set out there

00:16:48.970 --> 00:16:52.780
by a lot of my colleagues,
including bigger data, better

00:16:52.780 --> 00:16:56.020
data, and then novel uses of
some of the newer kinds of data

00:16:56.020 --> 00:16:59.430
that we have access to.

00:16:59.430 --> 00:17:01.530
So first in terms of big data.

00:17:01.530 --> 00:17:03.320
We heard a little bit
about the promises

00:17:03.320 --> 00:17:05.569
of electronic medical records.

00:17:05.569 --> 00:17:07.640
We've thought through
things like registries.

00:17:07.640 --> 00:17:09.829
There's a lot of
web-based data out there.

00:17:09.829 --> 00:17:13.160
You can use Google searches
to predict flu epidemics.

00:17:13.160 --> 00:17:17.569
You can use Facebook networks
to understand social contagion.

00:17:17.569 --> 00:17:19.170
There's a lot of app-based data.

00:17:19.170 --> 00:17:22.730
So if you're wearing a Fitbit,
we can, in research settings,

00:17:22.730 --> 00:17:28.294
use that information to really
get an idea of your behaviors.

00:17:28.294 --> 00:17:29.960
And then some of the
newer kinds of data

00:17:29.960 --> 00:17:31.860
are big just by definition.

00:17:31.860 --> 00:17:34.130
Genetics and
epigenetics and imaging

00:17:34.130 --> 00:17:37.340
collects huge amounts
of data points.

00:17:37.340 --> 00:17:38.950
So this is all really
exciting, and I

00:17:38.950 --> 00:17:41.800
feel thrilled to be an
epidemiologist at an era

00:17:41.800 --> 00:17:43.596
when these resources exist.

00:17:43.596 --> 00:17:45.970
But I think we have to be
mindful that the big data alone

00:17:45.970 --> 00:17:47.720
is not why it's exciting.

00:17:47.720 --> 00:17:49.210
It's exciting
because we can tie it

00:17:49.210 --> 00:17:51.260
to the questions
we're trying to ask,

00:17:51.260 --> 00:17:54.520
and we can find a way to
answer those questions using

00:17:54.520 --> 00:17:56.890
this data.

00:17:56.890 --> 00:17:59.170
The same kind of thing could
be said for better data

00:17:59.170 --> 00:18:01.090
that I think we're
getting better and better

00:18:01.090 --> 00:18:02.680
about having more
valid measurements,

00:18:02.680 --> 00:18:06.340
having repeated
measurements in individuals,

00:18:06.340 --> 00:18:09.130
and then certainly getting
kinds of measurements that

00:18:09.130 --> 00:18:11.140
let us peer into
human biology in a way

00:18:11.140 --> 00:18:15.460
that we just weren't
able to decades before.

00:18:15.460 --> 00:18:17.380
As just one example
of this, I work

00:18:17.380 --> 00:18:20.170
with a couple of cohort
studies in the Netherlands

00:18:20.170 --> 00:18:22.330
where we have
repeated brain imaging

00:18:22.330 --> 00:18:24.250
on individuals in our studies.

00:18:24.250 --> 00:18:29.410
So across childhood development
all the way through the elderly

00:18:29.410 --> 00:18:32.350
we're able to kind of
see how the brains change

00:18:32.350 --> 00:18:34.510
in these large studies.

00:18:34.510 --> 00:18:36.340
And this is really
exciting and it really

00:18:36.340 --> 00:18:39.070
opens these opportunities to
understand what healthy aging

00:18:39.070 --> 00:18:41.500
looks like, how we can
prevent cognitive decline,

00:18:41.500 --> 00:18:44.830
how we could promote
better brain development

00:18:44.830 --> 00:18:46.960
during childhood, and so on.

00:18:46.960 --> 00:18:48.700
But it's exciting
because we can tie

00:18:48.700 --> 00:18:52.530
that data to these questions.

00:18:52.530 --> 00:18:54.360
And then finally,
some of the newer data

00:18:54.360 --> 00:18:58.080
allows us to have new
uses for this data.

00:18:58.080 --> 00:19:00.630
And one example that's similar
to the quasi-experimental

00:19:00.630 --> 00:19:02.190
designs we heard
about earlier is

00:19:02.190 --> 00:19:03.960
this idea that
our genes could be

00:19:03.960 --> 00:19:06.409
leveraged as a
natural experiment.

00:19:06.409 --> 00:19:08.700
That, for example, if you
started with a question about

00:19:08.700 --> 00:19:11.280
whether obesity affects
mental health outcomes,

00:19:11.280 --> 00:19:14.310
you could look at
obesity-related genes

00:19:14.310 --> 00:19:17.080
as a proxy for leveraging
this natural experiment

00:19:17.080 --> 00:19:20.272
to try to answer that question.

00:19:20.272 --> 00:19:21.730
And, again, that's
really exciting,

00:19:21.730 --> 00:19:24.250
but these advanced
methods as well as

00:19:24.250 --> 00:19:25.720
the bigger data
and the better data

00:19:25.720 --> 00:19:27.760
alone are not going
to save us from having

00:19:27.760 --> 00:19:29.050
imprecise questions.

00:19:29.050 --> 00:19:30.490
That we need to
think through how

00:19:30.490 --> 00:19:33.340
we're using this to get
back to those big questions,

00:19:33.340 --> 00:19:35.830
back to the more precise
versions of them,

00:19:35.830 --> 00:19:37.150
and really tie it all together.

00:19:40.630 --> 00:19:43.090
And so what is the
future of epidemiology?

00:19:43.090 --> 00:19:45.040
Well, when I think
about these big themes,

00:19:45.040 --> 00:19:48.710
I think about them all as
fitting into this whole process

00:19:48.710 --> 00:19:49.969
that I was going through.

00:19:49.969 --> 00:19:51.760
That we're starting
with this big question.

00:19:51.760 --> 00:19:53.950
We're distilling it down
to these more manageable

00:19:53.950 --> 00:19:57.220
questions, collecting
and analyzing data,

00:19:57.220 --> 00:19:59.620
and discussing the
results transparently.

00:19:59.620 --> 00:20:02.350
And so these are offering
us huge opportunities

00:20:02.350 --> 00:20:04.294
to kind of get at
this middle step,

00:20:04.294 --> 00:20:05.710
but we need to be
mindful of where

00:20:05.710 --> 00:20:08.030
it fits in the whole process.

00:20:08.030 --> 00:20:10.300
So finally, I just wanted
to talk a little bit

00:20:10.300 --> 00:20:13.360
about one of the key roles
of epidemiologists here,

00:20:13.360 --> 00:20:16.520
which is being communicators
about all of this.

00:20:16.520 --> 00:20:19.990
So part of the themes of what I
just went through highlight how

00:20:19.990 --> 00:20:22.780
we communicate our results
to fellow epidemiologists

00:20:22.780 --> 00:20:24.820
and fellow scientists,
but we also

00:20:24.820 --> 00:20:26.980
have to be mindful
that this conversation

00:20:26.980 --> 00:20:29.440
is much bigger than just
the scientific community.

00:20:29.440 --> 00:20:33.850
We want our research to
be informing policies

00:20:33.850 --> 00:20:35.140
at some level.

00:20:35.140 --> 00:20:37.600
We want health care providers,
patients in communities,

00:20:37.600 --> 00:20:41.200
to understand the
impact of these findings

00:20:41.200 --> 00:20:44.546
and use that to inform
their decisions.

00:20:44.546 --> 00:20:46.420
And ultimately, I see
that this communication

00:20:46.420 --> 00:20:50.140
is improved by specifically
tie into questions

00:20:50.140 --> 00:20:52.930
that we want to answer to the
way that we answer to them.

00:20:52.930 --> 00:20:54.490
So the way we
collect and use data

00:20:54.490 --> 00:20:57.670
to answer them as directly
and best as we can

00:20:57.670 --> 00:21:00.117
and keep that process going.

00:21:00.117 --> 00:21:01.700
And so with that, I
just want to thank

00:21:01.700 --> 00:21:05.060
the numerous collaborators that
have shaped many of the ideas

00:21:05.060 --> 00:21:07.262
that I went through
here, and thank you

00:21:07.262 --> 00:21:08.220
all for your attention.

00:21:08.220 --> 00:21:10.710
[APPLAUSE]

00:21:15.700 --> 00:21:20.230
- So I would like to thank all
of my co-presenters for just

00:21:20.230 --> 00:21:24.930
beautifully setting up my talk.

00:21:24.930 --> 00:21:28.220
No, I really want to
give you guys a big hug.

00:21:28.220 --> 00:21:29.030
Let me know--

00:21:29.030 --> 00:21:29.530
OK.

00:21:29.530 --> 00:21:30.250
There we go.

00:21:30.250 --> 00:21:33.420
So most of my work is--

00:21:33.420 --> 00:21:37.300
I'm really interested in how
we as epidemiologists can

00:21:37.300 --> 00:21:40.480
use data to make
progress in actually

00:21:40.480 --> 00:21:42.770
reducing health disparities.

00:21:42.770 --> 00:21:45.717
So I just started at
Johns Hopkins, and lo

00:21:45.717 --> 00:21:47.800
and behold I found out
that a lot of my colleagues

00:21:47.800 --> 00:21:50.320
are actually developing
and evaluating

00:21:50.320 --> 00:21:52.990
interventions to reduce
disparities in health.

00:21:52.990 --> 00:21:56.260
So, for example, reducing
differences in hypertension

00:21:56.260 --> 00:21:58.610
control between
blacks and whites.

00:21:58.610 --> 00:22:00.190
And a lot of these
interventions are

00:22:00.190 --> 00:22:02.290
based on our current
understanding

00:22:02.290 --> 00:22:04.600
of the epidemiology
and about logic models,

00:22:04.600 --> 00:22:07.120
and so I'm wondering about
the sorts of questions

00:22:07.120 --> 00:22:09.580
that we're asking
when we're informing

00:22:09.580 --> 00:22:12.290
those sorts of interventions,
and what those interventions

00:22:12.290 --> 00:22:13.420
should target.

00:22:13.420 --> 00:22:15.878
So that's really what I'm going
to talk to you about today.

00:22:15.878 --> 00:22:17.750
In my mind, I think
of it as a work

00:22:17.750 --> 00:22:20.930
that's helping to
extend and further build

00:22:20.930 --> 00:22:24.450
an epidemiology of
health disparities.

00:22:24.450 --> 00:22:25.870
So before I begin,
I think there's

00:22:25.870 --> 00:22:29.140
some background material
that needs to be covered.

00:22:29.140 --> 00:22:31.360
And what do I mean by
a health disparity?

00:22:31.360 --> 00:22:36.010
It's not just a difference
in diseases across groups.

00:22:36.010 --> 00:22:38.740
The one definition that
really resonates with me

00:22:38.740 --> 00:22:41.590
is one that was put forth
by Margaret Whitehead

00:22:41.590 --> 00:22:43.690
for the World
Health Organization,

00:22:43.690 --> 00:22:45.640
later updated by
Paula Braveman that

00:22:45.640 --> 00:22:49.420
says that it's a disparity
in outcomes across socially

00:22:49.420 --> 00:22:51.940
defined groups that results
through some mechanism

00:22:51.940 --> 00:22:57.430
of injustice or a process
of marginalization.

00:22:57.430 --> 00:23:01.080
So, for example, in the United
States racial ethnic minorities

00:23:01.080 --> 00:23:04.540
because of the history
of Jim Crow, slavery,

00:23:04.540 --> 00:23:07.210
structural racism,
segregation, housing

00:23:07.210 --> 00:23:10.780
policy, interpersonal
discrimination, and also

00:23:10.780 --> 00:23:15.220
lately implicit bias,
this has erected

00:23:15.220 --> 00:23:18.880
significant political and
economic barriers which have,

00:23:18.880 --> 00:23:22.300
number one, predisposed
racial ethnic minorities

00:23:22.300 --> 00:23:26.560
to a higher likelihood
of being exposed

00:23:26.560 --> 00:23:28.420
to environmental
toxins, psychological

00:23:28.420 --> 00:23:31.630
stresses, impeded their
ability to lead and engage

00:23:31.630 --> 00:23:36.010
in healthier lifestyles,
and also erected barriers

00:23:36.010 --> 00:23:40.000
to quality care.

00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:42.130
Just to make things a
little bit more concrete

00:23:42.130 --> 00:23:45.850
about incorporating
this notion of justice

00:23:45.850 --> 00:23:49.540
into our measurement
of other disparities,

00:23:49.540 --> 00:23:51.490
it's actually useful
to look at the way

00:23:51.490 --> 00:23:54.490
the Institute of Medicine
defines a disparity

00:23:54.490 --> 00:23:56.320
in the receipt of health care.

00:23:56.320 --> 00:24:00.940
They would define a disparity
in receipt of health care

00:24:00.940 --> 00:24:04.060
that should capture differences
that arise in access to care,

00:24:04.060 --> 00:24:06.390
or differences that arise
in the ability to pay,

00:24:06.390 --> 00:24:09.190
or differences that arise
because perhaps the clinician

00:24:09.190 --> 00:24:10.960
in the face of
clinical uncertainty

00:24:10.960 --> 00:24:14.530
is relying on poor
provider-patient communication,

00:24:14.530 --> 00:24:17.530
or perhaps
stereotypes associated

00:24:17.530 --> 00:24:20.350
with the social group
that a patient belongs to.

00:24:20.350 --> 00:24:22.780
But if there were
actual differences

00:24:22.780 --> 00:24:25.840
in the clinical need
between the populations

00:24:25.840 --> 00:24:27.814
and there were differences
because of that,

00:24:27.814 --> 00:24:30.230
that's not something that would
contribute to a disparity.

00:24:30.230 --> 00:24:34.450
So, for example, in the
same psychiatric studies

00:24:34.450 --> 00:24:36.550
that Sonya was
talking about, you

00:24:36.550 --> 00:24:41.770
see a 60% lower prevalence of
major depression for blacks.

00:24:41.770 --> 00:24:45.460
And so if you see
disparities in treatment

00:24:45.460 --> 00:24:47.860
that may not necessarily
constitute a disparity.

00:24:47.860 --> 00:24:50.470
You would want to estimate
disparities in anti-depressant

00:24:50.470 --> 00:24:52.660
use among those who
have a clinical need

00:24:52.660 --> 00:24:54.460
for antidepressants.

00:24:54.460 --> 00:24:57.250
So it's clear that our
measures of disparity

00:24:57.250 --> 00:25:00.890
should be capturing processes
that involve marginalization

00:25:00.890 --> 00:25:02.350
and also injustice.

00:25:02.350 --> 00:25:04.150
So in thinking of the health--

00:25:04.150 --> 00:25:07.630
of the epidemiology
of health disparities,

00:25:07.630 --> 00:25:09.880
I think it's also good
to go back to the basics.

00:25:09.880 --> 00:25:12.460
Even though this has
been a central theme

00:25:12.460 --> 00:25:15.130
throughout the day,
we're essentially

00:25:15.130 --> 00:25:18.640
charged with understanding
how diseases are

00:25:18.640 --> 00:25:21.370
distributed in the population.

00:25:21.370 --> 00:25:23.680
And one of the major
hallmarks of epidemiology

00:25:23.680 --> 00:25:26.710
has been to identify what
are the causal factors that

00:25:26.710 --> 00:25:31.150
are actually influencing
disease with the ultimate goal

00:25:31.150 --> 00:25:35.870
that we develop interventions
to improve population health.

00:25:35.870 --> 00:25:39.070
This is a conceptual model by
the late Brian MacMahon, who

00:25:39.070 --> 00:25:42.010
first chaired the
Department of Epidemiology

00:25:42.010 --> 00:25:45.276
at the Harvard T.H Chan
School of Public Health.

00:25:45.276 --> 00:25:51.520
And what-- and in
this model it reflects

00:25:51.520 --> 00:25:55.686
the current thinking at the
time where chronic diseases--

00:25:55.686 --> 00:25:58.060
it was realized that chronic
diseases weren't just caused

00:25:58.060 --> 00:26:01.750
by a single agent but actually
a constellation of factors.

00:26:01.750 --> 00:26:04.120
And a key insight of
his was that it's not

00:26:04.120 --> 00:26:07.750
necessary to map out the entire
causal structure of a disease

00:26:07.750 --> 00:26:13.450
or how all of these factors
coordinate and orchestrate

00:26:13.450 --> 00:26:14.690
to cause disease.

00:26:14.690 --> 00:26:17.830
But rather, it's important
to identify the particularly

00:26:17.830 --> 00:26:20.440
salient causes that
intervening on them,

00:26:20.440 --> 00:26:26.030
we could reduce a substantial
amount of disease and morbidity

00:26:26.030 --> 00:26:28.220
in the population.

00:26:28.220 --> 00:26:29.950
Now this aspect
of multi-causation

00:26:29.950 --> 00:26:32.460
has been discussed
quite a bit today.

00:26:32.460 --> 00:26:35.200
It's been a thorn in the
side of many epidemiologists,

00:26:35.200 --> 00:26:39.750
because these causes are
correlated with each other.

00:26:39.750 --> 00:26:42.190
And so in the absence
of a randomized trial--

00:26:42.190 --> 00:26:45.760
say, if I was going to look
at the effect of eating

00:26:45.760 --> 00:26:50.240
a healthier diet and whether I
could control my hypertension--

00:26:50.240 --> 00:26:53.680
well, it might be that
patients like me also

00:26:53.680 --> 00:26:56.680
live in neighborhoods
that are food deserts

00:26:56.680 --> 00:27:00.070
and don't have opportunities
to buy healthier foods,

00:27:00.070 --> 00:27:03.820
but the streets also may
not be safe to exercise on.

00:27:03.820 --> 00:27:07.720
There may not be facilities
where I can go and exercise.

00:27:07.720 --> 00:27:09.880
So you have this
correlation between being

00:27:09.880 --> 00:27:15.650
able to eat a nutritious meal
and also exercise regularly.

00:27:15.650 --> 00:27:19.550
And so without going into it,
we've heard about this today,

00:27:19.550 --> 00:27:22.240
but I spent the last five
to eight years of my life

00:27:22.240 --> 00:27:27.010
learning how to tease out this
association between causes

00:27:27.010 --> 00:27:29.710
to try to map towards
a randomized trial.

00:27:29.710 --> 00:27:32.710
Some of that involves tools
like propensity score matching,

00:27:32.710 --> 00:27:37.410
regression discontinuity,
statistical adjustment.

00:27:37.410 --> 00:27:41.460
This is a figure showing the
life expectancy in the United

00:27:41.460 --> 00:27:48.270
States from 1975 to 2003 for
blacks and whites segregated

00:27:48.270 --> 00:27:50.460
by sex.

00:27:50.460 --> 00:27:53.580
What you see here is you
see that for all groups

00:27:53.580 --> 00:27:57.150
you see an improvement in life
expectancy by at least six

00:27:57.150 --> 00:28:02.220
to eight years, but you also
see that the racial difference

00:28:02.220 --> 00:28:05.280
in life expectancy
over that period

00:28:05.280 --> 00:28:07.925
has persisted for both
males and females.

00:28:07.925 --> 00:28:12.030
And so the implication
of this figure to me

00:28:12.030 --> 00:28:15.990
is that simply understanding
and intervening

00:28:15.990 --> 00:28:19.290
on the determinants of health
or determinants of disease

00:28:19.290 --> 00:28:21.900
may improve population health,
but it may not necessarily

00:28:21.900 --> 00:28:27.310
translate into the
reduction of disparities.

00:28:27.310 --> 00:28:31.260
One of the major thinkers
of health disparities

00:28:31.260 --> 00:28:33.210
and their genesis
is Sherman James.

00:28:33.210 --> 00:28:37.890
He was the pioneer of
studying health disparities.

00:28:37.890 --> 00:28:42.450
And what-- in this model
what I particularly like

00:28:42.450 --> 00:28:45.330
is that he's linking a
determinant of disease

00:28:45.330 --> 00:28:47.520
to disparities and
outcomes, and he's

00:28:47.520 --> 00:28:49.490
shown this in a very
comprehensive way.

00:28:49.490 --> 00:28:54.890
So you see determinants
[INAUDIBLE] disease organized

00:28:54.890 --> 00:28:59.807
as environmental factors also as
behavioral factors, the issues

00:28:59.807 --> 00:29:00.890
of quality in health care.

00:29:00.890 --> 00:29:04.080
Now in the text, you can't
really see this in the figure,

00:29:04.080 --> 00:29:06.000
but in the text what
he goes on to say

00:29:06.000 --> 00:29:09.090
is that actually the disparities
and these determinants

00:29:09.090 --> 00:29:12.790
of the outcome that are driving
disparities in these outcomes.

00:29:12.790 --> 00:29:15.610
So, for example,
disparities in incidence,

00:29:15.610 --> 00:29:18.640
he's arguing, as you can see
by the weight of this arrow,

00:29:18.640 --> 00:29:22.440
are driven largely
by disparities

00:29:22.440 --> 00:29:24.720
in the environment and
air and housing quality

00:29:24.720 --> 00:29:29.040
and in social relationships,
experiencing discrimination,

00:29:29.040 --> 00:29:33.150
living in areas where there's
high concentrations of poverty.

00:29:33.150 --> 00:29:34.770
Disparities in
prognosis, though,

00:29:34.770 --> 00:29:36.720
are driven more by
disparities in the access

00:29:36.720 --> 00:29:39.670
to and the utilization
of health care

00:29:39.670 --> 00:29:42.810
whereas disparities in mortality
are driven more by prognosis

00:29:42.810 --> 00:29:47.940
and also disparities in
care, with the acknowledgment

00:29:47.940 --> 00:29:50.250
that all of these disparities
and these causal factors

00:29:50.250 --> 00:29:55.410
are shaped by a larger political
and economic structures.

00:29:55.410 --> 00:29:59.095
Now in thinking of
designing an intervention,

00:29:59.095 --> 00:30:00.720
if we had a particular
outcome in mind,

00:30:00.720 --> 00:30:05.350
well, we could target so many
different disparities here.

00:30:05.350 --> 00:30:08.010
So how do we actually choose?

00:30:08.010 --> 00:30:09.570
How do we do that?

00:30:09.570 --> 00:30:13.440
And there are numerous
things that we

00:30:13.440 --> 00:30:15.900
have to consider and trade off.

00:30:15.900 --> 00:30:18.180
For example, how
much will it cost?

00:30:18.180 --> 00:30:19.110
Is it feasible?

00:30:19.110 --> 00:30:21.600
Do we have a window
of opportunity?

00:30:21.600 --> 00:30:23.250
Do we have the political will?

00:30:23.250 --> 00:30:25.470
Do we think that these
interventions are sustainable?

00:30:25.470 --> 00:30:27.930
But I think the key
ingredient to all of this

00:30:27.930 --> 00:30:31.170
is solid evidence
that intervening

00:30:31.170 --> 00:30:34.470
to remove disparities
in a particular target

00:30:34.470 --> 00:30:37.590
that we're pretty confident
that it will result in reducing

00:30:37.590 --> 00:30:38.990
disparities in the outcomes.

00:30:38.990 --> 00:30:42.390
So I would call
that effectiveness.

00:30:42.390 --> 00:30:46.260
So how do we actually
use data to understand

00:30:46.260 --> 00:30:48.500
how removing
disparities in a target

00:30:48.500 --> 00:30:51.570
will actually lead to a
reduction in disparities

00:30:51.570 --> 00:30:52.800
of outcomes?

00:30:52.800 --> 00:30:55.140
Without going into the
specifics of this today,

00:30:55.140 --> 00:30:58.020
I would say that most
of what we do today

00:30:58.020 --> 00:31:01.530
is to quantify how disparities
in a particular target

00:31:01.530 --> 00:31:05.400
statistically explain
disparities and outcomes.

00:31:05.400 --> 00:31:08.010
The problem is is that
most of these approaches

00:31:08.010 --> 00:31:12.120
are not explicitly accounting
for potential confounding

00:31:12.120 --> 00:31:14.070
factors of those targets.

00:31:14.070 --> 00:31:17.010
And so we're not ruling
out alternate explanations

00:31:17.010 --> 00:31:20.320
of why those disparities
in those targets

00:31:20.320 --> 00:31:23.572
may statistically explain
disparities and outcomes.

00:31:23.572 --> 00:31:25.530
So if you think back to
that graph I showed you

00:31:25.530 --> 00:31:27.810
about diet and nutrition, there
are these other compounding

00:31:27.810 --> 00:31:28.309
factors.

00:31:28.309 --> 00:31:32.040
And that's really what I'm
going to talk to you about today

00:31:32.040 --> 00:31:34.950
is how we can improve these
methods to incorporate

00:31:34.950 --> 00:31:37.740
explicit assumptions
about confounding control.

00:31:37.740 --> 00:31:41.460
I'm going to do that by
walking through a very--

00:31:41.460 --> 00:31:45.870
what I hope is an easy to
digest example analysis.

00:31:45.870 --> 00:31:51.210
I'm going to re-use data from
a seminal paper by Roland Fryer

00:31:51.210 --> 00:31:54.990
who's actually a renowned
economist here at Harvard

00:31:54.990 --> 00:31:58.170
University, who showed that
if you look at the association

00:31:58.170 --> 00:31:59.890
between race--

00:31:59.890 --> 00:32:02.490
and some key outcomes,
including race, incarceration,

00:32:02.490 --> 00:32:03.900
and unemployment--

00:32:03.900 --> 00:32:06.780
if you adjust for
educational attainment,

00:32:06.780 --> 00:32:10.090
you see that those disparities
reduce substantially.

00:32:10.090 --> 00:32:13.850
And in the case of health, you
see that the disparity actually

00:32:13.850 --> 00:32:15.720
vanishes.

00:32:15.720 --> 00:32:18.560
And so essentially
what the data shows

00:32:18.560 --> 00:32:20.910
is that disparities in
educational attainment or test

00:32:20.910 --> 00:32:25.410
scores statistically explain
disparities in wages,

00:32:25.410 --> 00:32:28.570
disparities in incarceration,
and disparities in health.

00:32:28.570 --> 00:32:32.160
But there are alternate
explanations we could consider.

00:32:32.160 --> 00:32:35.520
For example, it may
be that disparities

00:32:35.520 --> 00:32:37.180
in educational
attainment are merely

00:32:37.180 --> 00:32:39.430
a reflection of
disparities in childhood

00:32:39.430 --> 00:32:41.410
socioeconomic conditions.

00:32:41.410 --> 00:32:45.010
And so it begs the question,
will we see those same results

00:32:45.010 --> 00:32:48.520
if we repeat the analyses to
actually control for childhood

00:32:48.520 --> 00:32:50.380
socioeconomic conditions?

00:32:50.380 --> 00:32:55.660
Another question is, well,
maybe the attractive target

00:32:55.660 --> 00:32:57.520
could be test scores,
but maybe the target

00:32:57.520 --> 00:33:00.010
could be to actually remove
disparities in childhood

00:33:00.010 --> 00:33:01.750
socioeconomic conditions.

00:33:01.750 --> 00:33:03.610
It's another question
we could ask.

00:33:03.610 --> 00:33:05.320
A third question
is, well, what if we

00:33:05.320 --> 00:33:07.150
could remove disparities
in both childhood

00:33:07.150 --> 00:33:10.090
socioeconomic conditions
and test scores?

00:33:10.090 --> 00:33:11.770
And so what I would
like to do is just

00:33:11.770 --> 00:33:18.370
to walk through a couple of
example questions in this data,

00:33:18.370 --> 00:33:23.110
incorporating, again, clear
assumptions about confounding.

00:33:23.110 --> 00:33:26.670
And even though the
methods are going

00:33:26.670 --> 00:33:29.370
to be really pretty
accessible and pretty simple,

00:33:29.370 --> 00:33:32.100
they do draw on a power
counterfactual framework that

00:33:32.100 --> 00:33:34.530
does map to a
hypothetical trial, which

00:33:34.530 --> 00:33:38.520
allows you to really say if you
believe that you've measured

00:33:38.520 --> 00:33:41.550
and adjusted for all the
appropriate confounders

00:33:41.550 --> 00:33:44.250
that you can interpret it
as an intervention effect.

00:33:44.250 --> 00:33:47.490
And so really what you're
asking is if we could intervene

00:33:47.490 --> 00:33:51.900
to equalize these risk factors,
if we could intervene to remove

00:33:51.900 --> 00:33:55.170
disparities in this target, how
would that impact disparities

00:33:55.170 --> 00:33:56.940
in the outcome?

00:33:56.940 --> 00:34:01.142
And so I'm going to run
through four analyses.

00:34:01.142 --> 00:34:02.600
One, I'm going to
ask, what's going

00:34:02.600 --> 00:34:05.570
to happen to the disparities
in wages, incarceration,

00:34:05.570 --> 00:34:08.210
and in health if we could
remove disparities in childhood

00:34:08.210 --> 00:34:10.219
socioeconomic conditions?

00:34:10.219 --> 00:34:14.799
Then I'm going to ask, what
would happen to disparities

00:34:14.799 --> 00:34:18.440
in our outcomes if among
those with the same childhood

00:34:18.440 --> 00:34:21.860
socioeconomic status, we
could remove disparities

00:34:21.860 --> 00:34:24.139
in educational attainment
as reflected in test scores?

00:34:24.139 --> 00:34:26.630
And, again, I'm changing
the population here,

00:34:26.630 --> 00:34:29.150
because I want to rule out
differences in childhood

00:34:29.150 --> 00:34:30.159
socioeconomic status.

00:34:30.159 --> 00:34:32.179
I'm going to account
for confounding.

00:34:32.179 --> 00:34:34.779
The third one is, what if
we could intervene jointly

00:34:34.779 --> 00:34:37.070
to remove disparities in
childhood socioeconomic status

00:34:37.070 --> 00:34:38.370
and test scores?

00:34:38.370 --> 00:34:42.080
And the last one is really, what
if we could remove disparities

00:34:42.080 --> 00:34:45.330
overall irrespective of
childhood socioeconomic status,

00:34:45.330 --> 00:34:49.820
which may be something that
we're more interested in.

00:34:49.820 --> 00:34:52.760
So consider our
first intervention

00:34:52.760 --> 00:34:55.610
to remove disparities in
childhood socioeconomic status.

00:34:55.610 --> 00:34:57.560
Under some pretty
strong assumptions

00:34:57.560 --> 00:34:59.570
and in this
simplified example, we

00:34:59.570 --> 00:35:01.490
could estimate this
by fitting a model

00:35:01.490 --> 00:35:05.880
for our outcome given race and
the covariate's age, gender,

00:35:05.880 --> 00:35:07.460
and ethnicity.

00:35:07.460 --> 00:35:09.620
And the race coefficient
in that model

00:35:09.620 --> 00:35:11.990
would simply describe
the disparity

00:35:11.990 --> 00:35:14.580
in the population
as we we've observed

00:35:14.580 --> 00:35:17.690
for people the same age,
gender, and ethnicity.

00:35:17.690 --> 00:35:20.540
Now if we refit that model and
we include a term for childhood

00:35:20.540 --> 00:35:23.660
socioeconomic conditions, again,
under some strong assumptions

00:35:23.660 --> 00:35:29.060
we would interpret that
as the remaining disparity

00:35:29.060 --> 00:35:31.330
in our outcomes
after an intervention

00:35:31.330 --> 00:35:36.170
to remove disparities in
childhood socioeconomic status.

00:35:36.170 --> 00:35:38.420
The key assumption
here is that we've

00:35:38.420 --> 00:35:40.940
adjusted for all the
confounders of childhood

00:35:40.940 --> 00:35:43.820
socioeconomic status, and we've
heard a lot about that those

00:35:43.820 --> 00:35:46.760
are usually pre-treatment
variables that

00:35:46.760 --> 00:35:49.940
are also determinants
of whatever outcomes

00:35:49.940 --> 00:35:51.240
that you're studying.

00:35:51.240 --> 00:35:55.070
So conceptually, what
does this really mean?

00:35:55.070 --> 00:35:58.240
So to help us sort through
this, I created some figures.

00:35:58.240 --> 00:36:01.370
So on this top line here,
you see the distributions

00:36:01.370 --> 00:36:05.300
of childhood
socioeconomic conditions,

00:36:05.300 --> 00:36:08.225
educational attainment as
measured by test scores,

00:36:08.225 --> 00:36:12.266
and the distributions
of our outcome.

00:36:12.266 --> 00:36:14.765
And on the bottom, we have the
counterfactual distributions.

00:36:14.765 --> 00:36:17.170
And this is for blacks
and then for whites.

00:36:17.170 --> 00:36:19.080
So we have the
counterfactual distributions.

00:36:19.080 --> 00:36:21.790
And so what the yellow
arrow represents

00:36:21.790 --> 00:36:24.470
is the effect of
our intervention

00:36:24.470 --> 00:36:27.230
to actively remove
disparities in childhood

00:36:27.230 --> 00:36:28.730
socioeconomic conditions.

00:36:28.730 --> 00:36:31.630
Namely, to shift the
distribution of childhood

00:36:31.630 --> 00:36:33.410
socioeconomic conditions
such that they

00:36:33.410 --> 00:36:35.840
align with the
distribution of childhood

00:36:35.840 --> 00:36:38.750
socioeconomic
conditions for whites.

00:36:38.750 --> 00:36:42.590
The faint dotted arrow
represents the propagation

00:36:42.590 --> 00:36:46.590
of this effect to reduce
disparities in test scores

00:36:46.590 --> 00:36:50.390
and also reduce disparities
in our outcomes finally.

00:36:50.390 --> 00:36:52.310
So that was our
first intervention

00:36:52.310 --> 00:36:53.790
to remove disparities
in childhood

00:36:53.790 --> 00:36:56.390
socioeconomic conditions.

00:36:56.390 --> 00:36:59.600
Our second intervention
is to remove disparities

00:36:59.600 --> 00:37:03.230
in our outcomes among
those of the same childhood

00:37:03.230 --> 00:37:07.790
socioeconomic conditions
and by removing disparities

00:37:07.790 --> 00:37:12.020
in educational attainment
as reflected in test scores.

00:37:12.020 --> 00:37:14.360
So, again, under some
pretty strong assumptions,

00:37:14.360 --> 00:37:18.470
we could estimate this by
fitting a model for our outcome

00:37:18.470 --> 00:37:21.172
given race on the covariate's
age, gender, and ethnicity,

00:37:21.172 --> 00:37:23.630
but we also want to include in
this initial model childhood

00:37:23.630 --> 00:37:25.422
socioeconomic conditions,
because we want

00:37:25.422 --> 00:37:27.110
to account for confounding.

00:37:27.110 --> 00:37:29.780
So, again, now the race
coefficient in that model

00:37:29.780 --> 00:37:32.390
is going to give us our
observed disparity among people

00:37:32.390 --> 00:37:37.820
who share the same socioeconomic
status in childhood.

00:37:37.820 --> 00:37:41.440
Now we're going to add to that
model a term for test scores.

00:37:41.440 --> 00:37:43.820
And what this and
the race coefficient

00:37:43.820 --> 00:37:46.520
in this new model would equal--

00:37:46.520 --> 00:37:49.130
again, under some
strong assumptions--

00:37:49.130 --> 00:37:53.000
what the disparity we would
observe after an intervention

00:37:53.000 --> 00:37:57.170
to remove disparities
in test scores

00:37:57.170 --> 00:38:00.740
among those who have the same
childhood socioeconomic status.

00:38:00.740 --> 00:38:02.240
Again, this is
under an assumption

00:38:02.240 --> 00:38:05.564
that we've measured all the
confounders of test scores

00:38:05.564 --> 00:38:06.480
and adjusted for them.

00:38:06.480 --> 00:38:11.420
So heuristically what's
going on here is we're--

00:38:11.420 --> 00:38:13.580
I'm showing you the
distributions of childhood

00:38:13.580 --> 00:38:16.520
socioeconomic
conditions, and then I'm

00:38:16.520 --> 00:38:20.300
showing you the black and white
distributions for test scores

00:38:20.300 --> 00:38:22.250
among those with low
socioeconomic status

00:38:22.250 --> 00:38:24.500
and among those with high
socioeconomic status,

00:38:24.500 --> 00:38:26.240
and then also for the outcomes.

00:38:26.240 --> 00:38:30.850
Again, conditional on
childhood socioeconomic status.

00:38:30.850 --> 00:38:35.280
And on the bottom line, we have
our counterfactual disparities.

00:38:35.280 --> 00:38:38.000
So the intervention doesn't
touch socioeconomic status

00:38:38.000 --> 00:38:41.390
at all, but rather
it's within levels

00:38:41.390 --> 00:38:43.490
or among those who
share the same childhood

00:38:43.490 --> 00:38:44.580
socioeconomic status.

00:38:44.580 --> 00:38:47.279
So there are some details
I put into this figure

00:38:47.279 --> 00:38:48.320
that I want to point out.

00:38:48.320 --> 00:38:51.440
The first detail is that for
those with lower childhood

00:38:51.440 --> 00:38:54.170
socioeconomic status,
it's highly plausible

00:38:54.170 --> 00:38:56.430
that the distribution of
test scores for both blacks

00:38:56.430 --> 00:39:00.930
and whites is actually lower
than the population average.

00:39:00.930 --> 00:39:04.470
And then, again, for those with
high childhood socioeconomic

00:39:04.470 --> 00:39:07.140
conditions, their distributions
are going to be higher.

00:39:07.140 --> 00:39:10.200
The implication of this is that
when we do our intervention

00:39:10.200 --> 00:39:14.010
to shift the black distribution
to where the white distribution

00:39:14.010 --> 00:39:16.140
is, for those with low
socioeconomic status

00:39:16.140 --> 00:39:18.030
we're not going to
move it that far.

00:39:18.030 --> 00:39:20.400
But this is problematic,
because this is where

00:39:20.400 --> 00:39:22.440
blacks are overrepresented.

00:39:22.440 --> 00:39:25.620
And so our intervention
to reduce disparities

00:39:25.620 --> 00:39:28.440
in educational attainment among
those with the same childhood

00:39:28.440 --> 00:39:30.810
socioeconomic status
is probably not

00:39:30.810 --> 00:39:34.020
going to achieve as much
as we would like it to.

00:39:34.020 --> 00:39:35.730
But yet this is
the very analysis,

00:39:35.730 --> 00:39:38.070
this is the principal
analysis that we have to do,

00:39:38.070 --> 00:39:41.280
because we want to
count for confounding.

00:39:41.280 --> 00:39:43.110
My childhood
socioeconomic status.

00:39:43.110 --> 00:39:45.300
So our third
intervention is to look

00:39:45.300 --> 00:39:48.810
at what could happen if we could
intervene to reduce disparities

00:39:48.810 --> 00:39:53.730
in both childhood socioeconomic
conditions and also

00:39:53.730 --> 00:39:56.410
educational attainment as
reflected in test scores.

00:39:56.410 --> 00:39:58.200
So as similar to
before, we're going

00:39:58.200 --> 00:40:00.300
to start with a model
for outcome given race

00:40:00.300 --> 00:40:02.400
and the covariate's initial.

00:40:02.400 --> 00:40:04.170
Race coefficient
is the disparity

00:40:04.170 --> 00:40:05.970
we observe in the population.

00:40:05.970 --> 00:40:10.650
If we add in terms for childhood
socioeconomic status and also

00:40:10.650 --> 00:40:13.740
test scores, the
new race coefficient

00:40:13.740 --> 00:40:17.070
is going to-- we could interpret
that as the residual disparity

00:40:17.070 --> 00:40:19.680
we would see under an
intervention to jointly remove

00:40:19.680 --> 00:40:22.620
disparities in childhood
socioeconomic status

00:40:22.620 --> 00:40:24.130
and also test scores.

00:40:24.130 --> 00:40:26.130
Here, we have a stronger
confounding assumptions

00:40:26.130 --> 00:40:27.360
that we need to meet.

00:40:27.360 --> 00:40:30.360
We need to ensure that there
is no unmeasured confounding

00:40:30.360 --> 00:40:32.820
for childhood socioeconomic
status, and also

00:40:32.820 --> 00:40:35.410
no unmeasured confounding
for test scores.

00:40:35.410 --> 00:40:39.090
So this is a stronger
assumption that we need than we

00:40:39.090 --> 00:40:42.350
used for our other analyses.

00:40:42.350 --> 00:40:45.810
And so heuristically, these
are observed distributions

00:40:45.810 --> 00:40:48.330
for childhood socioeconomic
status test scores and outcome,

00:40:48.330 --> 00:40:49.788
and you can see
our intervention is

00:40:49.788 --> 00:40:54.120
to shift the distributions of
childhood socioeconomic status

00:40:54.120 --> 00:40:58.800
and test scores for blacks to
their respective distributions

00:40:58.800 --> 00:41:02.400
among whites and observe some
reduction in the disparity

00:41:02.400 --> 00:41:03.600
in the outcomes.

00:41:03.600 --> 00:41:06.390
So I've described to you
so far three interventions.

00:41:06.390 --> 00:41:09.660
The first intervention would
be to reduce disparities

00:41:09.660 --> 00:41:11.886
in childhood
socioeconomic status.

00:41:11.886 --> 00:41:13.260
The second one is
where we wanted

00:41:13.260 --> 00:41:16.380
to look at the impact
of removing disparities

00:41:16.380 --> 00:41:18.180
in test scores,
but we had to do it

00:41:18.180 --> 00:41:21.157
among a special group of people
who share the same childhood

00:41:21.157 --> 00:41:22.740
socioeconomic status
because we wanted

00:41:22.740 --> 00:41:24.630
to control for confounding.

00:41:24.630 --> 00:41:26.190
And this third one
was we said, well,

00:41:26.190 --> 00:41:28.530
let's just try to
intervene on both.

00:41:28.530 --> 00:41:30.960
But really an intervention
that we might think about

00:41:30.960 --> 00:41:34.320
is, well, what if we could just
move disparities in test scores

00:41:34.320 --> 00:41:37.590
without even
looking at childhood

00:41:37.590 --> 00:41:41.200
socioeconomic conditions but
account for the confounding

00:41:41.200 --> 00:41:41.700
there?

00:41:41.700 --> 00:41:43.680
That's the real trick.

00:41:43.680 --> 00:41:45.642
That's the real tough one there.

00:41:45.642 --> 00:41:47.100
And we're interested
in doing this,

00:41:47.100 --> 00:41:49.590
because it may be more
feasible to remove disparities

00:41:49.590 --> 00:41:52.140
in educational attainment
than to remove disparities

00:41:52.140 --> 00:41:55.030
in economic conditions.

00:41:55.030 --> 00:41:57.180
So without getting into
too much of the math,

00:41:57.180 --> 00:42:00.330
it turns out to
estimate this, to answer

00:42:00.330 --> 00:42:04.200
this sort of question, we can't
rely on the typical subtraction

00:42:04.200 --> 00:42:06.120
of race coefficients.

00:42:06.120 --> 00:42:10.500
And the reason why is that
an intervention to remove

00:42:10.500 --> 00:42:12.690
disparities in
test scores overall

00:42:12.690 --> 00:42:15.840
is going to partially block
the effects of disparities

00:42:15.840 --> 00:42:18.660
in childhood
socioeconomic conditions.

00:42:18.660 --> 00:42:22.500
And so without-- so if we
think of it another way,

00:42:22.500 --> 00:42:24.510
the effect of childhood
socioeconomic status

00:42:24.510 --> 00:42:28.000
on our outcomes is partially
mediated by test scores.

00:42:28.000 --> 00:42:30.210
So if we intervene,
we're going to block

00:42:30.210 --> 00:42:32.220
part of the effect of
disparities in childhood

00:42:32.220 --> 00:42:34.560
socioeconomic conditions.

00:42:34.560 --> 00:42:38.310
And in English the way
that this is estimated

00:42:38.310 --> 00:42:42.570
in these linear models
is simply to first start

00:42:42.570 --> 00:42:48.090
with the disparity reduction
upon equalizing test scores

00:42:48.090 --> 00:42:50.490
among those with the same
childhood socioeconomic status.

00:42:50.490 --> 00:42:52.290
That was our second
intervention.

00:42:52.290 --> 00:42:54.930
Then we're going to add to that
how much the disparity would

00:42:54.930 --> 00:42:57.490
be reduced under removing
disparities in childhood

00:42:57.490 --> 00:42:58.710
socioeconomic status.

00:42:58.710 --> 00:43:00.390
That was our first intervention.

00:43:00.390 --> 00:43:02.460
But we're not going to
add all of that back in.

00:43:02.460 --> 00:43:05.010
We're only going to
add in the amount

00:43:05.010 --> 00:43:09.000
by which the effect of childhood
socioeconomic status is not--

00:43:09.000 --> 00:43:13.650
well, is mediated
by test scores.

00:43:13.650 --> 00:43:16.590
And so heuristically
all we're doing here

00:43:16.590 --> 00:43:19.206
is intervening to shift the
entire distribution of test

00:43:19.206 --> 00:43:20.830
scores among blacks
to where whites is,

00:43:20.830 --> 00:43:24.050
but we're not doing anything to
the distribution of childhood

00:43:24.050 --> 00:43:25.960
socioeconomic conditions.

00:43:25.960 --> 00:43:30.180
So in our re-analysis of
the data, what do we see?

00:43:30.180 --> 00:43:33.270
Well, we see as we would
expect that the most effective

00:43:33.270 --> 00:43:39.930
intervention is to remove
disparities in both childhood

00:43:39.930 --> 00:43:42.590
socioeconomic conditions
and also test scores.

00:43:42.590 --> 00:43:46.710
So it would removed 74% of
the disparities in wages,

00:43:46.710 --> 00:43:48.900
81% of disparities
in incarceration,

00:43:48.900 --> 00:43:54.000
and completely eliminates all
the disparities in health.

00:43:54.000 --> 00:43:57.030
What's fascinating,
though, is that if we just

00:43:57.030 --> 00:44:00.210
were to remove disparities in
educational attainment alone

00:44:00.210 --> 00:44:02.760
as measured in test scores,
it's not that far behind.

00:44:02.760 --> 00:44:06.090
We could remove two
thirds of the disparities

00:44:06.090 --> 00:44:09.930
in wages, two thirds of the
disparities in incarceration,

00:44:09.930 --> 00:44:12.720
and once you account
for the standard errors,

00:44:12.720 --> 00:44:14.550
all of the disparity in health.

00:44:14.550 --> 00:44:17.580
What's also interesting
is that it's

00:44:17.580 --> 00:44:20.490
as effective or more
effective than intervening

00:44:20.490 --> 00:44:22.350
to reduce disparities
in childhood

00:44:22.350 --> 00:44:24.120
socioeconomic conditions.

00:44:24.120 --> 00:44:26.550
And so just looking at
wage-- disparities in wages

00:44:26.550 --> 00:44:29.430
here, if we removed
disparities in childhood

00:44:29.430 --> 00:44:31.650
socioeconomic conditions
we remove about a quarter

00:44:31.650 --> 00:44:32.880
of the disparity.

00:44:32.880 --> 00:44:35.910
But if we were to intervene
to remove disparities

00:44:35.910 --> 00:44:39.420
in educational attainment
as reflected in test scores,

00:44:39.420 --> 00:44:43.350
we would remove two
thirds of the disparity.

00:44:43.350 --> 00:44:47.370
And finally, our--
and eventually we're

00:44:47.370 --> 00:44:49.495
going to remove disparities
among those who have

00:44:49.495 --> 00:44:51.260
the same socioeconomic status.

00:44:51.260 --> 00:44:53.960
Remove 65% of the
disparity among those

00:44:53.960 --> 00:44:56.910
who have the same socioeconomic
status, but it bears pointing

00:44:56.910 --> 00:45:01.290
out that this is a
less ambitious goal

00:45:01.290 --> 00:45:03.815
because the initial
disparity is smaller.

00:45:03.815 --> 00:45:06.380
And so if you just
look at that--

00:45:06.380 --> 00:45:09.270
the difference between where
you start and where you end up,

00:45:09.270 --> 00:45:14.510
you can see that it's a
less effective intervention.

00:45:14.510 --> 00:45:18.560
Also, the nature of what we
mean by educational attainment

00:45:18.560 --> 00:45:22.130
is important, which gets back
to Sonja's point about what

00:45:22.130 --> 00:45:23.210
question are we asking.

00:45:23.210 --> 00:45:26.320
If we were to try to equalize
total years of education,

00:45:26.320 --> 00:45:29.720
we see that the
disparity is actually

00:45:29.720 --> 00:45:33.320
as effective as equalizing
childhood socioeconomic status,

00:45:33.320 --> 00:45:37.020
or in some cases less effective.

00:45:37.020 --> 00:45:40.650
So there are some limitations.

00:45:40.650 --> 00:45:43.930
We used really simple models and
worked with Tyler VanderWeele,

00:45:43.930 --> 00:45:45.360
which this is based on.

00:45:45.360 --> 00:45:48.200
We've extended these to
more general outcomes,

00:45:48.200 --> 00:45:49.730
non-linear outcomes.

00:45:49.730 --> 00:45:51.290
We have non-parametric
formulae that

00:45:51.290 --> 00:45:54.350
can incorporate interactions,
account for confounders that

00:45:54.350 --> 00:45:57.380
are descendants of race
or whatever social status

00:45:57.380 --> 00:45:58.760
that you're using.

00:45:58.760 --> 00:46:01.970
In future work, we hope
to extend these out

00:46:01.970 --> 00:46:04.520
to longitudinal outcomes,
including repeated measures

00:46:04.520 --> 00:46:08.090
and time to event outcomes.

00:46:08.090 --> 00:46:11.690
And also in other work,
it's of great interest today

00:46:11.690 --> 00:46:14.720
you hear a lot of people
talking about intersectionality.

00:46:14.720 --> 00:46:16.940
So people are not just
marginalized in one way.

00:46:16.940 --> 00:46:19.880
They may be marginalized because
of their socioeconomic position

00:46:19.880 --> 00:46:21.170
and also their race.

00:46:21.170 --> 00:46:23.390
In other work, I've
talked about the notion

00:46:23.390 --> 00:46:26.420
of joint disparities and also
intersectional disparities,

00:46:26.420 --> 00:46:30.380
and it is definitely possible
to map these sorts of analyses

00:46:30.380 --> 00:46:34.760
to disparities
along multiple axes.

00:46:34.760 --> 00:46:37.490
The implications of our study,
though-- what we found is we

00:46:37.490 --> 00:46:39.260
actually confirmed
the results of Fryer,

00:46:39.260 --> 00:46:40.850
but we've added
important information.

00:46:40.850 --> 00:46:43.970
Number one, we've
ruled out disparities

00:46:43.970 --> 00:46:45.620
in childhood
socioeconomic status

00:46:45.620 --> 00:46:46.880
as an alternate explanation.

00:46:46.880 --> 00:46:48.920
It really does look
like disparities

00:46:48.920 --> 00:46:52.130
in educational attainment
as reflected in test scores

00:46:52.130 --> 00:46:55.580
is really the
important target here.

00:46:58.950 --> 00:47:02.840
So what are the implications
for the next steps

00:47:02.840 --> 00:47:04.890
in health disparities research?

00:47:04.890 --> 00:47:08.280
And I think Sonya
stole my thunder here,

00:47:08.280 --> 00:47:13.620
but what I would like to say is
that we have a real opportunity

00:47:13.620 --> 00:47:16.680
here to do these sorts of
analyses very carefully.

00:47:16.680 --> 00:47:20.310
This was a toy example
here, but when we actually

00:47:20.310 --> 00:47:23.280
have cohort data or
exquisite medical records,

00:47:23.280 --> 00:47:25.500
we can actually look at
what is the thing that we're

00:47:25.500 --> 00:47:27.834
trying to intervene to
reduce disparities in.

00:47:27.834 --> 00:47:29.750
For example, if we're
looking at it adherence,

00:47:29.750 --> 00:47:31.650
or if we're looking
at nutrition,

00:47:31.650 --> 00:47:34.650
or if we're looking
at whatever target

00:47:34.650 --> 00:47:36.750
that we're interested
in, we should

00:47:36.750 --> 00:47:39.600
think about what are the
confounders of that target.

00:47:39.600 --> 00:47:41.400
And then we should
also try to ensure

00:47:41.400 --> 00:47:42.777
that we have longitudinal data.

00:47:42.777 --> 00:47:44.610
We should also try to
ensure that we respect

00:47:44.610 --> 00:47:46.860
the temporality
of our confounders

00:47:46.860 --> 00:47:48.690
in our targets and
our outcomes, just

00:47:48.690 --> 00:47:52.350
like we do in careful and
rigorous epidemiologic studies.

00:47:52.350 --> 00:47:56.250
We have a real
opportunity to do this.

00:47:56.250 --> 00:47:59.150
Now all this talk
about confounding,

00:47:59.150 --> 00:48:01.960
the big elephant in the room
is unmeasured confounding.

00:48:01.960 --> 00:48:05.216
Which our first speaker
eloquently pointed out

00:48:05.216 --> 00:48:06.840
that sometimes you
have these variables

00:48:06.840 --> 00:48:09.780
measured, but many times
they're not measured.

00:48:09.780 --> 00:48:12.000
But what I would argue
is that epidemiology

00:48:12.000 --> 00:48:13.620
of health disparities
is actually

00:48:13.620 --> 00:48:17.655
in a better position than a
de novo study in epidemiology.

00:48:17.655 --> 00:48:22.890
And the reason is is because
usually health disparities

00:48:22.890 --> 00:48:26.110
analyses are built on existing
knowledge about epidemiology.

00:48:26.110 --> 00:48:27.975
So, for example, if
we're just starting out

00:48:27.975 --> 00:48:32.150
where we're trying to identify
how diseases distribute

00:48:32.150 --> 00:48:33.870
in the population,
well, that's the step

00:48:33.870 --> 00:48:36.640
where we're actually describing
disparities in disease.

00:48:36.640 --> 00:48:38.610
When epidemiology is
doing the hard work

00:48:38.610 --> 00:48:41.700
of trying to identify the
causal factors, teasing out

00:48:41.700 --> 00:48:43.560
what are the other
risk factors, are we

00:48:43.560 --> 00:48:47.010
doing the best adjustments
for confounding?

00:48:47.010 --> 00:48:50.130
This is really where
the field of disparities

00:48:50.130 --> 00:48:52.380
would still be
determining what are

00:48:52.380 --> 00:48:54.660
the disparities in
those determinants that

00:48:54.660 --> 00:48:57.450
are being identified by
those epidemiologic studies.

00:48:57.450 --> 00:49:01.320
When we go onto
designing strategies

00:49:01.320 --> 00:49:03.960
to improve population
health, part of that we're

00:49:03.960 --> 00:49:06.180
thinking about, well, how
can we actually reduce

00:49:06.180 --> 00:49:06.960
these disparities?

00:49:06.960 --> 00:49:09.600
But we have all this
knowledge that we've

00:49:09.600 --> 00:49:11.400
gleaned from these
epidemiologic studies.

00:49:11.400 --> 00:49:13.757
So when I would go and
pull these medical records

00:49:13.757 --> 00:49:15.840
and think about what are
the variables that I need

00:49:15.840 --> 00:49:19.560
to adjust for, well,
for disease areas

00:49:19.560 --> 00:49:21.990
like cardiovascular disease,
we know what the major risk

00:49:21.990 --> 00:49:23.040
factors are.

00:49:23.040 --> 00:49:25.224
We know what needs
to be adjusted for.

00:49:25.224 --> 00:49:26.890
And even if our cohorts
don't have them,

00:49:26.890 --> 00:49:29.220
it at least gives
us a clear list

00:49:29.220 --> 00:49:31.260
of things that
need to be measured

00:49:31.260 --> 00:49:35.810
in whatever cohorts or synthetic
cohorts that we're designing.

00:49:35.810 --> 00:49:39.780
So I'd argue that, yes, the
confounding structures are

00:49:39.780 --> 00:49:41.550
something to be concerned
about, but we're

00:49:41.550 --> 00:49:45.210
in a much better
position when trying

00:49:45.210 --> 00:49:48.420
to do these sorts of analyses
that I'm describing here.

00:49:48.420 --> 00:49:52.440
And hopefully these
sorts of robust analyses

00:49:52.440 --> 00:49:54.960
are what's going to be used
to build conceptual models

00:49:54.960 --> 00:49:58.620
for designing interventions.

00:49:58.620 --> 00:50:03.000
Another application of the
work that I'm presenting here

00:50:03.000 --> 00:50:08.310
is that how we
define a disparity

00:50:08.310 --> 00:50:10.620
matters exquisitely
for its explanation.

00:50:10.620 --> 00:50:15.031
As I said before, a disparity
measure, particularly when

00:50:15.031 --> 00:50:16.530
it comes to treatment
of care, would

00:50:16.530 --> 00:50:19.500
condition on certain things
and not others, right?

00:50:19.500 --> 00:50:23.670
So in the case of disparities
in anti-depressant treatment,

00:50:23.670 --> 00:50:25.950
we would condition
on clinical need.

00:50:25.950 --> 00:50:28.479
If we went on to condition
on access to care,

00:50:28.479 --> 00:50:30.270
we're going to miss
some of the disparities

00:50:30.270 --> 00:50:33.730
among people who aren't
able to access treatment.

00:50:33.730 --> 00:50:35.490
And so what that
means is when we

00:50:35.490 --> 00:50:37.830
have our covariates that
need to be adjusted for,

00:50:37.830 --> 00:50:39.180
we have a choice.

00:50:39.180 --> 00:50:41.640
So we can condition on
things like age and family

00:50:41.640 --> 00:50:44.545
history and gender
and prognostics score,

00:50:44.545 --> 00:50:46.920
and we can adjust for them
that way through conditioning.

00:50:46.920 --> 00:50:48.420
But for all of the
other things that

00:50:48.420 --> 00:50:51.920
are sort of tied to injustice,
like socioeconomic status,

00:50:51.920 --> 00:50:55.620
health literacy and
insurance, where you live,

00:50:55.620 --> 00:50:57.287
we don't have to
adjust on those things.

00:50:57.287 --> 00:50:59.411
I mean, we don't have to
condition on those things.

00:50:59.411 --> 00:51:01.640
We can adjust for them
without changing our disparity

00:51:01.640 --> 00:51:04.740
measure, which is important.

00:51:04.740 --> 00:51:07.220
So really, it's the hope
that with these sorts

00:51:07.220 --> 00:51:10.790
of careful principled
analyses that we can develop

00:51:10.790 --> 00:51:15.770
refined conceptual models that
will help us provide better

00:51:15.770 --> 00:51:17.390
estimates of how
effective it might

00:51:17.390 --> 00:51:20.570
be to intervene on
one particular target

00:51:20.570 --> 00:51:22.220
versus another.

00:51:22.220 --> 00:51:26.457
Thank you for listening, and
I welcome your questions.

00:51:26.457 --> 00:51:28.892
[APPLAUSE]

00:51:35.542 --> 00:51:36.250
- Thank you both.

00:51:36.250 --> 00:51:37.930
Those were really
terrific talks.

00:51:37.930 --> 00:51:41.350
I learned a bunch
of stuff from them.

00:51:41.350 --> 00:51:44.590
So we'll open up for
questions, and maybe--

00:51:44.590 --> 00:51:46.480
anybody's got a burning
one, you can start.

00:51:46.480 --> 00:51:51.310
But if not, I will
ask a couple of mine.

00:51:51.310 --> 00:51:53.230
So Sonya.

00:51:53.230 --> 00:51:56.510
So partly because I'm
fascinated by these studies,

00:51:56.510 --> 00:51:58.090
could you talk a little bit--

00:51:58.090 --> 00:52:01.360
you flashed up the picture
of the cell phone study.

00:52:01.360 --> 00:52:04.060
Can you tell folks a little
bit about those kind of studies

00:52:04.060 --> 00:52:05.840
and what you're doing and--

00:52:05.840 --> 00:52:06.340
- Sure.

00:52:06.340 --> 00:52:07.272
- --how those work?

00:52:07.272 --> 00:52:08.980
I think it's a really
interesting example

00:52:08.980 --> 00:52:10.250
of better data.

00:52:10.250 --> 00:52:10.750
- Sure.

00:52:10.750 --> 00:52:11.120
- Yeah.

00:52:11.120 --> 00:52:13.670
- And I'm happy to hear that
you have some experience with it

00:52:13.670 --> 00:52:14.170
as well.

00:52:14.170 --> 00:52:15.770
- Barely.

00:52:15.770 --> 00:52:16.270
- Yeah.

00:52:16.270 --> 00:52:18.250
So one of the main
starting points

00:52:18.250 --> 00:52:21.060
in this cohort study I
mentioned based in Rotterdam

00:52:21.060 --> 00:52:23.560
that I work with
is we're starting

00:52:23.560 --> 00:52:25.720
to have these kind
of app-based studies

00:52:25.720 --> 00:52:29.339
where we give participants
in our studies these

00:52:29.339 --> 00:52:31.630
prompts on their cell phone
to answer certain questions

00:52:31.630 --> 00:52:32.200
over time.

00:52:32.200 --> 00:52:33.700
And so just thinking
about something

00:52:33.700 --> 00:52:35.325
like eating disorders,
if you're trying

00:52:35.325 --> 00:52:37.150
to understand what
causes someone

00:52:37.150 --> 00:52:41.120
to engage in a compensatory
behavior today,

00:52:41.120 --> 00:52:43.630
and you're trying to
understand that behavior today,

00:52:43.630 --> 00:52:46.510
you want the context of
what happened on that day.

00:52:46.510 --> 00:52:48.400
And so these app-based
kind of things

00:52:48.400 --> 00:52:50.920
allow you to get real time
collection of that data

00:52:50.920 --> 00:52:53.080
rather than asking a
survey every two or three

00:52:53.080 --> 00:52:54.616
years or something like that.

00:52:54.616 --> 00:52:55.740
And so I think that-- yeah.

00:52:55.740 --> 00:52:58.690
There's a lot of opportunities
to refine your questions

00:52:58.690 --> 00:53:03.060
to ideas of what's happening
at the hourly limit,

00:53:03.060 --> 00:53:04.810
or the daily limit,
or things like that

00:53:04.810 --> 00:53:06.551
with these kinds of studies.

00:53:06.551 --> 00:53:07.050
- Yeah.

00:53:07.050 --> 00:53:09.010
So some of the things you can--

00:53:09.010 --> 00:53:12.220
we're doing a study that's
sort of similar to that,

00:53:12.220 --> 00:53:14.020
also looking at some
eating behaviors.

00:53:14.020 --> 00:53:17.440
You can look at perhaps what was
the potential emotional trigger

00:53:17.440 --> 00:53:20.560
that day, or you
can use GPS data--

00:53:20.560 --> 00:53:23.230
obviously with everybody's
permission to use it--

00:53:23.230 --> 00:53:28.930
and see was-- were they
walking by a Dunkin' Donuts?

00:53:28.930 --> 00:53:33.300
You can really get down to
a very fine-grained level.

00:53:33.300 --> 00:53:35.790
I see Burt's got
a question, too.

00:53:35.790 --> 00:53:36.790
Specific to this.

00:53:36.790 --> 00:53:38.194
Yeah?

00:53:38.194 --> 00:53:39.130
- Two great talks.

00:53:39.130 --> 00:53:41.470
Thank you very much.

00:53:41.470 --> 00:53:46.290
I have a question--
a question for Sonya.

00:53:46.290 --> 00:53:50.850
You say I would
like to basically do

00:53:50.850 --> 00:53:54.030
a trial to study efficacy,
but I can't very often.

00:53:54.030 --> 00:53:59.130
So let's design a study
to mimic then the trial.

00:53:59.130 --> 00:54:03.450
So that is what you want
to do to do a good study.

00:54:03.450 --> 00:54:08.160
And you also say I would like
to refine the question in such

00:54:08.160 --> 00:54:13.830
a way that I have a meaningful
answer to a good question.

00:54:13.830 --> 00:54:17.580
Now very often-- in
the past-- what is it,

00:54:17.580 --> 00:54:19.740
five to 10 years--
clinical trials

00:54:19.740 --> 00:54:22.950
are being criticized for
being not relevant in terms

00:54:22.950 --> 00:54:24.390
of the question they address.

00:54:24.390 --> 00:54:28.170
This tension between what you
want from a design viewpoint

00:54:28.170 --> 00:54:29.730
and from a relevance viewpoint.

00:54:29.730 --> 00:54:31.630
Can you discuss that a bit?

00:54:31.630 --> 00:54:32.650
- Sure.

00:54:32.650 --> 00:54:34.830
So I'll just take
one of the criticisms

00:54:34.830 --> 00:54:37.620
I know for trials,
which is that they often

00:54:37.620 --> 00:54:41.640
are focused on really
select patient populations.

00:54:41.640 --> 00:54:45.190
So just to stick with the
eating disorder example--

00:54:45.190 --> 00:54:48.420
if you want them to meet exactly
the criteria for anorexia

00:54:48.420 --> 00:54:51.660
nervosa, and you want to rule
out co-morbidities and things

00:54:51.660 --> 00:54:54.180
like that, you might
really restrict the ages.

00:54:54.180 --> 00:54:57.290
You might really restrict
it to females and so on.

00:54:57.290 --> 00:54:59.250
And so you might get
a really good estimate

00:54:59.250 --> 00:55:01.080
in that population
in that trial,

00:55:01.080 --> 00:55:04.870
but it doesn't generalize
to larger populations.

00:55:04.870 --> 00:55:07.260
What I would argue is actually
in observational studies,

00:55:07.260 --> 00:55:10.770
you have this opportunity to
make it exactly the population

00:55:10.770 --> 00:55:11.530
you care about.

00:55:11.530 --> 00:55:14.100
So like when we have
electronic medical records

00:55:14.100 --> 00:55:17.040
or we have big data
opportunities, if we think

00:55:17.040 --> 00:55:20.010
about the population we want
to ask the question for,

00:55:20.010 --> 00:55:23.110
we can make it more relevant
and tie it to that population.

00:55:23.110 --> 00:55:26.409
So I see it sort of
as maybe not the trial

00:55:26.409 --> 00:55:28.200
that we would have
conducted, but the trial

00:55:28.200 --> 00:55:30.090
we really wish we
could have conducted

00:55:30.090 --> 00:55:31.774
is what you're
trying to emulate.

00:55:31.774 --> 00:55:32.274
Yeah.

00:55:35.650 --> 00:55:37.900
- I've got a question for John.

00:55:37.900 --> 00:55:44.380
This is in the fantasy
baseball camp kind of realm.

00:55:44.380 --> 00:55:47.510
You talked about those
unmeasured confounders,

00:55:47.510 --> 00:55:49.090
and I think very
often when we're

00:55:49.090 --> 00:55:52.900
talking about social
disparities there's

00:55:52.900 --> 00:55:55.420
a lot of elephants
in the room and a lot

00:55:55.420 --> 00:55:57.910
of unmeasured confounders.

00:55:57.910 --> 00:56:02.450
And I think my question
for you would be, you had--

00:56:02.450 --> 00:56:05.240
for that analysis you had the
National Longitudinal Survey

00:56:05.240 --> 00:56:10.220
of Youth, which is actually
a pretty detailed data set.

00:56:10.220 --> 00:56:13.704
What would you ideally want
to answer the question-- first

00:56:13.704 --> 00:56:15.620
of all, what are the
particular questions that

00:56:15.620 --> 00:56:17.570
are most pressing to you?

00:56:17.570 --> 00:56:22.010
And then to get at those, what
are some of the pieces of data

00:56:22.010 --> 00:56:24.490
you'd really love to have?

00:56:24.490 --> 00:56:26.190
- Well, I think--

00:56:26.190 --> 00:56:28.690
so one area that I'm
actually starting to work in

00:56:28.690 --> 00:56:31.660
is in hypertension control.

00:56:31.660 --> 00:56:36.610
So I'm really interested
in lifestyle behaviors

00:56:36.610 --> 00:56:43.360
versus disparities in adherence.

00:56:43.360 --> 00:56:48.010
I think what I tried to stress
in the talk was that it's not

00:56:48.010 --> 00:56:50.350
really that you need the
confounders to be balanced

00:56:50.350 --> 00:56:51.850
across racial groups.

00:56:51.850 --> 00:56:55.510
You need them to be balanced
across exposure groups

00:56:55.510 --> 00:56:57.910
within racial groups

00:56:57.910 --> 00:57:00.460
So it's actually
the same assumption

00:57:00.460 --> 00:57:04.440
that we use in our standard
epidemiologic cohort analyses.

00:57:04.440 --> 00:57:06.620
It's no different.

00:57:06.620 --> 00:57:08.050
It's the same thing.

00:57:08.050 --> 00:57:11.710
So in terms of those,
I really just want

00:57:11.710 --> 00:57:13.930
to make sure that the
major risk factors

00:57:13.930 --> 00:57:17.080
for cardiovascular disease
are actually measured well

00:57:17.080 --> 00:57:18.130
among both groups.

00:57:18.130 --> 00:57:23.560
I think the challenges is
finding cohorts or follow-up

00:57:23.560 --> 00:57:28.507
studies where you have adequate
data on all social groups

00:57:28.507 --> 00:57:29.590
that you're interested in.

00:57:29.590 --> 00:57:31.090
I think that's the challenge.

00:57:31.090 --> 00:57:32.502
- Yep.

00:57:32.502 --> 00:57:33.002
Yep.

00:57:39.680 --> 00:57:40.180
- Hi.

00:57:40.180 --> 00:57:42.220
I have a question for
Dr. Jackson as well.

00:57:42.220 --> 00:57:45.880
So again, like with unmeasured
confounding and everything

00:57:45.880 --> 00:57:47.780
like that, and I was--

00:57:47.780 --> 00:57:49.870
kept thinking about
the first example

00:57:49.870 --> 00:57:53.400
you gave about depression
and clinical need.

00:57:53.400 --> 00:57:55.630
I guess like every
disparity that you

00:57:55.630 --> 00:57:57.730
see doesn't necessarily
mean necessarily

00:57:57.730 --> 00:58:00.610
like a difference
in people getting

00:58:00.610 --> 00:58:02.880
what they need
essentially when it comes

00:58:02.880 --> 00:58:04.150
between blacks and whites.

00:58:04.150 --> 00:58:05.380
But I think--

00:58:05.380 --> 00:58:08.140
I guess I would push on
that, because when it comes--

00:58:08.140 --> 00:58:10.000
I mean, isn't that
still a symptom

00:58:10.000 --> 00:58:12.020
of disparities in,
say, health care?

00:58:12.020 --> 00:58:14.110
So just because there's
a higher prevalence

00:58:14.110 --> 00:58:16.130
in, say, depression among--

00:58:16.130 --> 00:58:18.970
or at least clinical depression
among whites, I mean,

00:58:18.970 --> 00:58:21.970
does that still mean that
there can still potentially

00:58:21.970 --> 00:58:25.060
be the same level prevalence
of depression in blacks

00:58:25.060 --> 00:58:27.309
or even more so, but
it's because of stigma

00:58:27.309 --> 00:58:29.600
in mental health in the
community and things like that,

00:58:29.600 --> 00:58:31.540
and also barriers
to health care.

00:58:31.540 --> 00:58:34.120
That's like another unmeasured
thing we're not looking at.

00:58:34.120 --> 00:58:36.450
So even if you do a condition
on it in your analysis,

00:58:36.450 --> 00:58:39.100
it doesn't necessarily
account for it.

00:58:39.100 --> 00:58:40.690
- Well, there's a lot there.

00:58:40.690 --> 00:58:43.480
I think-- so there are--

00:58:43.480 --> 00:58:47.590
so in the Psych EPU literature,
you see a couple of things.

00:58:47.590 --> 00:58:51.370
Like, you see a lower prevalence
of both current and lifetime

00:58:51.370 --> 00:58:55.840
depression among blacks, but
you see a worse prognosis.

00:58:55.840 --> 00:58:58.060
So you see more--

00:58:58.060 --> 00:59:00.700
you see a higher prevalence
of recurrent depression

00:59:00.700 --> 00:59:04.240
and also chronic
forms of depression,

00:59:04.240 --> 00:59:07.480
and you see poorer function.

00:59:07.480 --> 00:59:09.160
So I'm not--

00:59:09.160 --> 00:59:14.180
I think if you are
thinking about clinical--

00:59:14.180 --> 00:59:15.680
once you condition
on clinical need,

00:59:15.680 --> 00:59:18.502
I'm not sure that you're
missing disparities in treatment

00:59:18.502 --> 00:59:20.960
if you're talking about people
who are showing up initially

00:59:20.960 --> 00:59:25.450
on a first episode, or if
it's a recurrent episode.

00:59:25.450 --> 00:59:29.180
I'm not sure if I'm answering
your question adequately,

00:59:29.180 --> 00:59:32.790
but I'm not sure how
you would be missing

00:59:32.790 --> 00:59:34.920
the disparity by really--

00:59:34.920 --> 00:59:38.090
so if you think about
a disparate treatment,

00:59:38.090 --> 00:59:42.520
you're saying that people
who need the medication

00:59:42.520 --> 00:59:46.040
are getting it less
often than someone who's

00:59:46.040 --> 00:59:48.760
in all other instances
clinically like them

00:59:48.760 --> 00:59:50.280
but of a different race.

00:59:50.280 --> 00:59:52.990
And the key issues
with that is that they

00:59:52.990 --> 00:59:55.430
both need the medication.

00:59:55.430 --> 00:59:57.670
Whether or not--
there's a lot of debate

00:59:57.670 --> 01:00:00.591
about our estimates in the
psychiatric epidemiology

01:00:00.591 --> 01:00:01.090
studies.

01:00:01.090 --> 01:00:03.160
Is it because of selection bias?

01:00:03.160 --> 01:00:05.620
There's a large chunks of the
African-American population

01:00:05.620 --> 01:00:08.500
missing from household surveys.

01:00:08.500 --> 01:00:11.560
Is it because of
differences in how

01:00:11.560 --> 01:00:15.640
people are answering
the tools that we use

01:00:15.640 --> 01:00:16.840
to measure depression?

01:00:16.840 --> 01:00:20.410
Is it because of differences in
reporting to somatic symptoms

01:00:20.410 --> 01:00:24.160
versus more
psychological symptoms?

01:00:24.160 --> 01:00:28.840
But none of those
alternate explanations

01:00:28.840 --> 01:00:31.030
have been compelling, at
least up to this point.

01:00:31.030 --> 01:00:36.610
So most people believe
estimates that the prevalence

01:00:36.610 --> 01:00:39.670
of major depression is, in fact,
lower among African-Americans

01:00:39.670 --> 01:00:41.770
So really the
disparities in treatment

01:00:41.770 --> 01:00:44.192
should really be conditional
on clinical need.

01:00:53.960 --> 01:00:57.730
- Sonya, something that you
put up during your talk really

01:00:57.730 --> 01:01:02.710
resonated with me, and that's
the notion of epidemiologists

01:01:02.710 --> 01:01:05.030
communicating with
non-epidemiologists,

01:01:05.030 --> 01:01:08.470
which is the focus
of this session here.

01:01:08.470 --> 01:01:10.960
And I'd love for both
of you to reflect

01:01:10.960 --> 01:01:13.930
on that, because I felt
like in my training,

01:01:13.930 --> 01:01:16.630
I wasn't trained
on how to do that.

01:01:16.630 --> 01:01:19.900
I can write a scientific
article like nobody's business,

01:01:19.900 --> 01:01:23.120
but I can't communicate
with the public.

01:01:23.120 --> 01:01:28.210
And yet so many of our public
health messages are known.

01:01:28.210 --> 01:01:29.640
Like, people know wear a condom.

01:01:29.640 --> 01:01:31.660
People know get vaccinated.

01:01:31.660 --> 01:01:34.800
And our approach-- my
impression of our approach

01:01:34.800 --> 01:01:40.550
has just been to lambaste the
public with more and more data.

01:01:40.550 --> 01:01:43.420
But so-- is it a
function of our training?

01:01:43.420 --> 01:01:45.730
Like, how do you think
we can go about doing

01:01:45.730 --> 01:01:46.911
a better job of this?

01:01:50.577 --> 01:01:51.910
- You know, this is a tough one.

01:01:51.910 --> 01:01:57.210
I think-- I don't know.

01:01:57.210 --> 01:01:59.322
Part of it's a challenge
of just the history

01:01:59.322 --> 01:02:00.780
of how we've
conducted the science,

01:02:00.780 --> 01:02:03.390
and that I think earlier
on we were really getting

01:02:03.390 --> 01:02:04.840
at just pure associations.

01:02:04.840 --> 01:02:06.900
And so we've really
trained the public

01:02:06.900 --> 01:02:11.100
to view a risk factor as
sort of being associated

01:02:11.100 --> 01:02:16.800
with a disease, but maybe
not necessarily thinking

01:02:16.800 --> 01:02:20.250
through in terms of gradations
about the particular type

01:02:20.250 --> 01:02:22.790
of question that we're asking.

01:02:22.790 --> 01:02:25.450
So, for instance,
duration of exposure

01:02:25.450 --> 01:02:30.651
to a particular risk factor
or among a certain subgroup.

01:02:30.651 --> 01:02:32.650
I'm not sure I actually
have an answer for that.

01:02:32.650 --> 01:02:35.980
I mean, part of it has to do
with the state of our science

01:02:35.980 --> 01:02:38.410
when it goes out to
the public, and how

01:02:38.410 --> 01:02:40.600
much control we have over
that to actually build

01:02:40.600 --> 01:02:41.740
in qualifiers.

01:02:44.590 --> 01:02:45.764
I'm not sure I have--

01:02:45.764 --> 01:02:47.430
to be honest, I just
don't have a good--

01:02:47.430 --> 01:02:49.950
it's a problem, I
think, in that we

01:02:49.950 --> 01:02:52.230
have a lot of
over-interpretation

01:02:52.230 --> 01:02:54.750
of our scientific results.

01:02:54.750 --> 01:02:57.240
I think most people,
when you explain

01:02:57.240 --> 01:02:59.340
the limitations of
epidemiology in terms

01:02:59.340 --> 01:03:01.120
of trying to make
fair comparisons,

01:03:01.120 --> 01:03:05.920
most people really
do understand that.

01:03:05.920 --> 01:03:13.650
But in terms of communicating
really finely detailed

01:03:13.650 --> 01:03:18.000
granular answers to
questions, I'm not sure

01:03:18.000 --> 01:03:22.342
that we're really there yet.

01:03:22.342 --> 01:03:23.300
- Yeah.

01:03:23.300 --> 01:03:26.630
I'd probably echo
some of that that--

01:03:26.630 --> 01:03:28.310
I think of--
certainly like when I

01:03:28.310 --> 01:03:31.750
talk to my parents or
non-epidemiologists

01:03:31.750 --> 01:03:35.330
in my friendship
or family circles.

01:03:35.330 --> 01:03:39.080
Everyone is very trained to
know that correlation is not

01:03:39.080 --> 01:03:39.960
causation, right?

01:03:39.960 --> 01:03:41.320
And that that's like--

01:03:41.320 --> 01:03:44.240
we get that from a high
school statistics course

01:03:44.240 --> 01:03:46.950
or middle school science class.

01:03:46.950 --> 01:03:52.160
And I think that's built
as this level of skepticism

01:03:52.160 --> 01:03:54.290
where you can just kind
of pick the studies you

01:03:54.290 --> 01:03:57.947
want to believe if they support
your beliefs about the world.

01:03:57.947 --> 01:04:00.530
And I think maybe something the
epidemiologist could do better

01:04:00.530 --> 01:04:03.740
is try to train people
to think through how

01:04:03.740 --> 01:04:05.510
if our question
really is causal.

01:04:05.510 --> 01:04:07.880
If I'm trying to decide,
should I take that treatment

01:04:07.880 --> 01:04:11.630
or should I recommend
this change in the schools

01:04:11.630 --> 01:04:13.940
or change in my
hospital policies

01:04:13.940 --> 01:04:18.830
or whatever it might be, how
can I support that empirically,

01:04:18.830 --> 01:04:20.390
and how can I
understand really what

01:04:20.390 --> 01:04:24.110
the assumptions are underlying
that empirical estimate?

01:04:24.110 --> 01:04:26.750
I'm not sure if that can
happen in high schools.

01:04:26.750 --> 01:04:29.660
I don't know if that's just--
when we convey our studies

01:04:29.660 --> 01:04:32.510
to really be transparent about
all the assumptions upon which

01:04:32.510 --> 01:04:34.070
they rest, because
maybe that just

01:04:34.070 --> 01:04:35.810
makes more skeptics
about it because they

01:04:35.810 --> 01:04:36.860
are strong assumptions.

01:04:36.860 --> 01:04:40.340
But I think that's probably
where I would start

01:04:40.340 --> 01:04:44.450
is just trying to revisit that
when our question is causal,

01:04:44.450 --> 01:04:46.820
we should be explicit
that that's the question

01:04:46.820 --> 01:04:49.897
and then how confident
we are in those answers.

01:04:49.897 --> 01:04:51.230
- If I could add one more thing.

01:04:51.230 --> 01:04:53.650
I think what would be--

01:04:53.650 --> 01:04:56.300
in addition to what
Sonya talked about--

01:04:56.300 --> 01:04:58.110
would be really
helpful is perhaps

01:04:58.110 --> 01:05:00.140
as epidemiologists
instead of saying

01:05:00.140 --> 01:05:01.940
what the question
has answered, maybe

01:05:01.940 --> 01:05:03.630
list out what it
hasn't answered.

01:05:03.630 --> 01:05:04.130
- Yeah.

01:05:04.130 --> 01:05:05.600
- So for a lot of
medications, we

01:05:05.600 --> 01:05:08.550
don't have data
on long term use.

01:05:08.550 --> 01:05:12.260
So for psychotropics, what's
the actual effectiveness

01:05:12.260 --> 01:05:14.870
five years out, six
years out, 10 years out?

01:05:14.870 --> 01:05:17.542
Do we actually have
good data on that?

01:05:17.542 --> 01:05:20.000
I think a lot of times when
we're thinking about these risk

01:05:20.000 --> 01:05:22.149
factors or things
that we encounter,

01:05:22.149 --> 01:05:23.690
there are certain
assumptions that we

01:05:23.690 --> 01:05:25.356
make about how we're
using them and what

01:05:25.356 --> 01:05:28.920
the risks are without
any data to support that.

01:05:28.920 --> 01:05:32.690
So I think pointing out
perhaps what the questions are

01:05:32.690 --> 01:05:34.970
that aren't being answered.

01:05:34.970 --> 01:05:37.179
If we list those all
along with the question

01:05:37.179 --> 01:05:38.720
that we did answer,
it would probably

01:05:38.720 --> 01:05:44.300
help frame what we know
and what we don't know.

01:05:44.300 --> 01:05:47.030
- Maybe just one other
thing I would add just

01:05:47.030 --> 01:05:50.000
thinking about this more
is among epidemiologists,

01:05:50.000 --> 01:05:52.610
I think we're good at doing
sensitivity analyses to try

01:05:52.610 --> 01:05:54.860
to understand how robust
our conclusions are,

01:05:54.860 --> 01:05:57.560
but that could be communicated
better as well, right?

01:05:57.560 --> 01:06:02.070
There's a lot of times
that we show something

01:06:02.070 --> 01:06:03.800
and we say there's
an effect, and then

01:06:03.800 --> 01:06:05.630
that makes some New
York Times headline

01:06:05.630 --> 01:06:09.200
and it gets lost in the noise
of how confident we are in that.

01:06:09.200 --> 01:06:12.020
But, I mean, we're confident
that vaccines save lives.

01:06:12.020 --> 01:06:14.990
We're confident that
vaccines do not cause autism.

01:06:14.990 --> 01:06:16.730
That smoking causes lung cancer.

01:06:16.730 --> 01:06:19.820
That safe storage practices
of guns saves lives.

01:06:19.820 --> 01:06:22.310
Like, we know those things,
and we know those things

01:06:22.310 --> 01:06:24.770
because we've done a lot
of sensitivity analyses.

01:06:24.770 --> 01:06:29.061
And I wonder if there's a way
to communicate that better too.

01:06:29.061 --> 01:06:29.561
Yeah.

01:06:34.292 --> 01:06:35.000
- Thank you both.

01:06:35.000 --> 01:06:37.150
I think just piggybacking
on the conversation

01:06:37.150 --> 01:06:39.980
about communicating results,
and also specifically John,

01:06:39.980 --> 01:06:42.609
you invoked this third part of
the definition of epidemiology.

01:06:42.609 --> 01:06:44.900
It's not just describing the
distribution determinants.

01:06:44.900 --> 01:06:48.920
It's using that knowledge to
apply to improve the health.

01:06:48.920 --> 01:06:51.560
So a question
specifically for you,

01:06:51.560 --> 01:06:53.030
John, and then for both of you--

01:06:53.030 --> 01:06:56.060
what is our role in the context
of your findings with test

01:06:56.060 --> 01:06:56.780
scores?

01:06:56.780 --> 01:06:59.750
It's easy to now have
this take home message

01:06:59.750 --> 01:07:01.610
after that complicated
mythologic kind

01:07:01.610 --> 01:07:04.100
of decomposition of the
effect to point to that,

01:07:04.100 --> 01:07:06.380
but obviously that's
also multi-factorial what

01:07:06.380 --> 01:07:08.150
goes into test scores,
and that's still

01:07:08.150 --> 01:07:10.430
kind of a proxy for
many other things

01:07:10.430 --> 01:07:13.380
that also intersect with
many different planes

01:07:13.380 --> 01:07:14.300
of our experience.

01:07:14.300 --> 01:07:17.120
But just can you guys
both speak to kind

01:07:17.120 --> 01:07:19.750
of what our role is
as epidemiologists

01:07:19.750 --> 01:07:21.710
in that next step of
moving things forward,

01:07:21.710 --> 01:07:23.724
or if you have
ideas of what that

01:07:23.724 --> 01:07:26.140
could look like within your
specific research [INAUDIBLE].

01:07:26.140 --> 01:07:27.350
- So in terms of--

01:07:27.350 --> 01:07:29.630
like in terms of
being a methodologist,

01:07:29.630 --> 01:07:32.600
I'm not an expert in
education by any means.

01:07:32.600 --> 01:07:35.080
But in terms of,
like, where I see

01:07:35.080 --> 01:07:37.580
the work that I'm
doing methodologically

01:07:37.580 --> 01:07:39.830
is really a first step.

01:07:39.830 --> 01:07:41.390
I haven't said
anything about how

01:07:41.390 --> 01:07:43.370
you're going to go about
reducing disparities,

01:07:43.370 --> 01:07:47.330
but if you know exactly what the
boundaries like what you could

01:07:47.330 --> 01:07:49.250
achieve then you
can actually start

01:07:49.250 --> 01:07:52.790
to think about how can I
design observational studies

01:07:52.790 --> 01:07:56.660
to actually get at more
detailed interventions

01:07:56.660 --> 01:07:58.140
that I could perhaps map out.

01:07:58.140 --> 01:08:01.100
So if you designed a
target trial to say,

01:08:01.100 --> 01:08:03.140
if we intervened on
these two social groups

01:08:03.140 --> 01:08:06.890
in particular ways, what would
the reduction and the disparity

01:08:06.890 --> 01:08:11.140
be, and have very explicit
intervention strategies.

01:08:11.140 --> 01:08:14.800
And that-- so sort of I
see as a winnowing down.

01:08:14.800 --> 01:08:16.760
So we have all these
targets, and then

01:08:16.760 --> 01:08:18.620
given sort of an
upper bound of what

01:08:18.620 --> 01:08:20.569
we could achieve by
removing disparities then

01:08:20.569 --> 01:08:24.620
we can actually get to finer
intervention strategies.

01:08:24.620 --> 01:08:28.520
Along the way, I think it's
important to also leverage

01:08:28.520 --> 01:08:32.779
actual policy changes
and actual interventions

01:08:32.779 --> 01:08:36.140
in natural experiments
to actually see

01:08:36.140 --> 01:08:39.630
what real interventions
have accomplished.

01:08:39.630 --> 01:08:42.170
And so I sort of take
these sorts of analyses

01:08:42.170 --> 01:08:46.778
as guiding our focus about what
to do follow-up studies on.

01:08:46.778 --> 01:08:48.319
And at the end of
the day, it's going

01:08:48.319 --> 01:08:51.680
to take real experiments
to actually get

01:08:51.680 --> 01:08:54.721
robust evidence for this.

01:08:54.721 --> 01:08:55.220
- Yeah.

01:08:55.220 --> 01:08:57.761
I'm not sure I can add anything
better to what you just said,

01:08:57.761 --> 01:08:58.600
so I won't even try.

01:09:04.490 --> 01:09:05.050
- Hi.

01:09:05.050 --> 01:09:09.430
I have multiple questions,
but I'll limit it to one.

01:09:09.430 --> 01:09:11.569
Well, actually maybe two.

01:09:11.569 --> 01:09:15.100
First, I was very interested
in the disparity in general

01:09:15.100 --> 01:09:18.790
for black males versus
white males [INAUDIBLE]

01:09:18.790 --> 01:09:23.050
going on and seeing not that
black males life expectancy

01:09:23.050 --> 01:09:26.229
is going up, but the
white males is going down.

01:09:26.229 --> 01:09:28.274
The big issue that's
being made about that.

01:09:28.274 --> 01:09:29.649
One of the things
that I'm really

01:09:29.649 --> 01:09:31.689
interested in when you
mentioned about test

01:09:31.689 --> 01:09:33.399
scores and education--

01:09:33.399 --> 01:09:36.010
recently, Mrs. Obama
was shocked that they

01:09:36.010 --> 01:09:40.090
want to roll back the standards
for the food, the quality

01:09:40.090 --> 01:09:41.979
of food that
students have, which

01:09:41.979 --> 01:09:45.310
is [INAUDIBLE] to brain which
contributes to test scores.

01:09:45.310 --> 01:09:48.340
And I don't know if there's an
opportunity for you to-- not

01:09:48.340 --> 01:09:50.260
you personally, but
you in the general--

01:09:50.260 --> 01:09:56.470
to speak about the correlation
between being fed well

01:09:56.470 --> 01:09:59.230
and being able to perform
to get to a higher

01:09:59.230 --> 01:10:00.330
socioeconomic status.

01:10:03.016 --> 01:10:04.890
- I think there's been
a lot of research that

01:10:04.890 --> 01:10:10.080
shows that providing
lunch and food programs

01:10:10.080 --> 01:10:16.150
actually improve
outcomes in education.

01:10:16.150 --> 01:10:20.340
But one thing that I think
there is an opportunity

01:10:20.340 --> 01:10:23.160
to sort of use is
to look at the data

01:10:23.160 --> 01:10:25.980
of the effect of
this policy change

01:10:25.980 --> 01:10:29.280
on outcomes for both whites and
blacks across different sectors

01:10:29.280 --> 01:10:31.190
of the nation.

01:10:31.190 --> 01:10:34.078
That's a first step of
something that we could do.

01:10:37.830 --> 01:10:39.842
- Was there a second question?

01:10:39.842 --> 01:10:40.800
Oh, we've got another--

01:10:44.630 --> 01:10:46.610
- Thank you very much.

01:10:46.610 --> 01:10:50.570
I was very struck-- especially
Sonya-- but on all four

01:10:50.570 --> 01:10:53.960
of your presentations today
about how accessible it

01:10:53.960 --> 01:10:57.530
was to non-epidemiologists.

01:10:57.530 --> 01:11:01.550
And I guess I wanted to go
back to the communications

01:11:01.550 --> 01:11:08.660
theme that has been talked about
a little bit in so much as,

01:11:08.660 --> 01:11:12.200
do you see that there are
natural partners or people

01:11:12.200 --> 01:11:14.680
in the public that you should--

01:11:14.680 --> 01:11:16.790
that you should
look at as advocates

01:11:16.790 --> 01:11:20.000
or develop different
types of partnerships

01:11:20.000 --> 01:11:23.510
so that the messages
that you're bringing out

01:11:23.510 --> 01:11:27.086
can be more
effectively delivered?

01:11:27.086 --> 01:11:28.310
- That's a great question.

01:11:28.310 --> 01:11:30.480
- That's a great question.

01:11:30.480 --> 01:11:33.140
So without having thought
about it before you asked

01:11:33.140 --> 01:11:35.150
that question at least,
off the top of my head

01:11:35.150 --> 01:11:37.760
I would say certainly there's
a lot of opportunities

01:11:37.760 --> 01:11:40.280
to work with more
nonprofit organizations,

01:11:40.280 --> 01:11:42.320
or maybe like the
heads of hospitals,

01:11:42.320 --> 01:11:46.490
if you're a researcher targeting
how we deliver treatment

01:11:46.490 --> 01:11:48.170
or something like that.

01:11:48.170 --> 01:11:50.180
I'd say the other
big partnership

01:11:50.180 --> 01:11:53.110
that I see is just the media.

01:11:53.110 --> 01:11:55.640
The media is not necessarily
that great at reporting

01:11:55.640 --> 01:11:59.180
on scientific findings, because
there is this balance of you

01:11:59.180 --> 01:12:01.310
don't want sensationalism.

01:12:01.310 --> 01:12:04.580
You don't actually want media
to be all about one study.

01:12:04.580 --> 01:12:07.280
As I tried to emphasize,
it's about this whole process

01:12:07.280 --> 01:12:10.460
and about continuing a
conversation about where

01:12:10.460 --> 01:12:12.470
we are with the science.

01:12:12.470 --> 01:12:14.450
But maybe that'd
be a place to start

01:12:14.450 --> 01:12:17.540
that if you get
newspaper articles or TV

01:12:17.540 --> 01:12:21.380
coverage of these studies
to be better articulated

01:12:21.380 --> 01:12:23.530
in the context of where
they're coming from.

01:12:23.530 --> 01:12:27.560
That might propagate further
into the communities more.

01:12:27.560 --> 01:12:30.200
I don't know if you
have other thoughts.

01:12:30.200 --> 01:12:32.340
- I don't have too
many other thoughts.

01:12:32.340 --> 01:12:35.120
I think it's important
to partner with the end

01:12:35.120 --> 01:12:38.240
users of your research.

01:12:38.240 --> 01:12:40.700
And so I think
getting them on board

01:12:40.700 --> 01:12:43.620
early on helps you ask
better questions that

01:12:43.620 --> 01:12:44.840
are more informed.

01:12:44.840 --> 01:12:48.220
So I'm primarily
work and methods,

01:12:48.220 --> 01:12:52.220
and so I have to partner
with clinicians and hospital

01:12:52.220 --> 01:12:54.320
administrators to
see exactly what are

01:12:54.320 --> 01:12:56.570
the types of interventions
that they're interested in,

01:12:56.570 --> 01:12:59.450
and how can the analyses that
I'm doing actually [INAUDIBLE].

01:12:59.450 --> 01:13:01.340
And if they're there
at the ground level,

01:13:01.340 --> 01:13:04.550
then I have an opportunity
to also educate them

01:13:04.550 --> 01:13:08.870
about what's possible with these
results and what they mean,

01:13:08.870 --> 01:13:12.350
what they answer and also
what they don't answer.

01:13:12.350 --> 01:13:15.800
I think sometimes
things can fall short

01:13:15.800 --> 01:13:19.220
when you do your
analyses in a vacuum,

01:13:19.220 --> 01:13:22.280
and then take them to
a stakeholder or a user

01:13:22.280 --> 01:13:26.510
and try to explain all
the intricacies of what

01:13:26.510 --> 01:13:28.880
you're doing.

01:13:28.880 --> 01:13:31.220
It could be problematic.

01:13:31.220 --> 01:13:33.390
- Maybe just to go with
that a little bit more--

01:13:33.390 --> 01:13:38.540
I could see too using a paradigm
that I was walking through

01:13:38.540 --> 01:13:40.790
with the step-by-step to
get the end users more

01:13:40.790 --> 01:13:43.370
to help with the precise
questions at the beginning,

01:13:43.370 --> 01:13:45.320
too, so that they're
actually engaging

01:13:45.320 --> 01:13:49.060
in the whole process with you.

01:13:49.060 --> 01:13:52.340
- This is a question for
all four of our presenters.

01:13:52.340 --> 01:13:55.520
We've talked about the
conclusions that epidemiology

01:13:55.520 --> 01:13:59.690
can reach, the importance
that these conclusions have

01:13:59.690 --> 01:14:05.300
on policy, and the importance
of communicating properly

01:14:05.300 --> 01:14:07.930
to be able to affect policy.

01:14:07.930 --> 01:14:09.860
Communication,
however, also depends

01:14:09.860 --> 01:14:12.590
on the receptivity
of your audience,

01:14:12.590 --> 01:14:15.710
and we have a great
difference in the audiences

01:14:15.710 --> 01:14:17.270
that you're addressing.

01:14:17.270 --> 01:14:19.550
Our first presenter
is addressing

01:14:19.550 --> 01:14:23.720
a audience which is very
receptive in general

01:14:23.720 --> 01:14:24.620
to the ideas.

01:14:24.620 --> 01:14:29.540
Our last presenter is addressing
the current political power

01:14:29.540 --> 01:14:33.380
structure, which is not going
to be receptive necessarily

01:14:33.380 --> 01:14:34.880
to these ideas.

01:14:34.880 --> 01:14:39.860
How did the four of you in
both your collective realms

01:14:39.860 --> 01:14:42.740
and your individual
specialized realms

01:14:42.740 --> 01:14:47.270
deal with these difficulties
of communicating effectively

01:14:47.270 --> 01:14:50.624
and productively?

01:14:50.624 --> 01:14:54.470
- That's a great question.

01:14:54.470 --> 01:14:57.020
- I'll start.

01:14:57.020 --> 01:14:57.560
Well, no.

01:14:57.560 --> 01:15:00.810
First, I would-- I really want
to thank you for that question.

01:15:00.810 --> 01:15:04.400
It's a challenge, because you
have to master so many things.

01:15:04.400 --> 01:15:06.590
Not just the methods,
the statistics, but also

01:15:06.590 --> 01:15:09.530
the history, the
policies, and there

01:15:09.530 --> 01:15:12.640
are a lot of things that are
areas where you can learn more.

01:15:15.800 --> 01:15:17.375
I think for me--

01:15:21.230 --> 01:15:25.070
that's a really tough question
of communicating effectively.

01:15:25.070 --> 01:15:27.950
I think part of it is learning
that I can't really do this

01:15:27.950 --> 01:15:30.170
alone and partnering
with other people who

01:15:30.170 --> 01:15:33.410
are doing this work who are also
doing this on the ground level,

01:15:33.410 --> 01:15:37.370
partnering with people who
are engaged in the community,

01:15:37.370 --> 01:15:39.290
people who are actually
developing policy.

01:15:39.290 --> 01:15:44.280
And maybe that's an
opportunity for me

01:15:44.280 --> 01:15:47.440
to sort of understand
how to frame

01:15:47.440 --> 01:15:53.911
my analyses in a way that's
both clear and also effective.

01:15:53.911 --> 01:15:55.410
I think the subtext
to your question

01:15:55.410 --> 01:16:03.630
is the weight on facts
today, especially facts

01:16:03.630 --> 01:16:15.270
that you don't agree with, it's
a lot harder now to come with--

01:16:15.270 --> 01:16:18.390
to come and present data,
especially when it challenges

01:16:18.390 --> 01:16:22.620
someone's preconceived notions.

01:16:22.620 --> 01:16:25.890
I'm not sure I have the best
answer for that at this moment.

01:16:25.890 --> 01:16:27.930
I think what I've
decided to do is

01:16:27.930 --> 01:16:33.570
to try to do the best
science that I can do,

01:16:33.570 --> 01:16:40.080
and if someone's mind is not
amenable or open to data,

01:16:40.080 --> 01:16:42.630
there's not really
much that I can do.

01:16:42.630 --> 01:16:46.320
But I can be persuasive
to people around them,

01:16:46.320 --> 01:16:53.230
or I can also be persuasive
to things on other dimensions,

01:16:53.230 --> 01:16:58.450
such as costs or other things
that they might care about.

01:17:01.030 --> 01:17:01.530
- Yeah.

01:17:01.530 --> 01:17:04.740
I guess I might add
some of my heroes

01:17:04.740 --> 01:17:07.830
in epidemiology work
in firearm safety

01:17:07.830 --> 01:17:13.380
and looking at how we can save
lives by storing guns safer,

01:17:13.380 --> 01:17:15.090
treating them safer,
things like that.

01:17:15.090 --> 01:17:18.037
Obviously, a very
hot political topic.

01:17:18.037 --> 01:17:19.620
I think, though,
some of the successes

01:17:19.620 --> 01:17:22.990
that I see in how they engage
in the science there is first

01:17:22.990 --> 01:17:24.990
just acknowledging
that they're doing

01:17:24.990 --> 01:17:27.150
these scientific
estimates-- that they're not

01:17:27.150 --> 01:17:29.040
giving a moral argument to it.

01:17:29.040 --> 01:17:34.020
They're not part of the
larger questions of liberties

01:17:34.020 --> 01:17:35.760
versus safety and all of that.

01:17:35.760 --> 01:17:38.160
They're just trying to
give these estimates

01:17:38.160 --> 01:17:40.890
of how many lives could be
saved or how many injuries

01:17:40.890 --> 01:17:44.110
could be prevented
and trying to do that.

01:17:44.110 --> 01:17:46.980
And then I think when they
communicate that they really

01:17:46.980 --> 01:17:52.350
look for people in
the communities that

01:17:52.350 --> 01:17:54.472
can start having
that conversation

01:17:54.472 --> 01:17:56.430
and propagating the
conversation a little more.

01:17:56.430 --> 01:17:59.700
So focusing on parents of
kids, because everybody

01:17:59.700 --> 01:18:04.830
wants our kids to be safe, or
focusing on the instructors

01:18:04.830 --> 01:18:06.270
of gun safety courses.

01:18:06.270 --> 01:18:08.160
And I think that
that's maybe how

01:18:08.160 --> 01:18:11.790
you do it is it's an incremental
conversation that you have.

01:18:11.790 --> 01:18:14.040
But recognizing that you're
doing the best science

01:18:14.040 --> 01:18:17.520
you can do, and that's part
of a larger story of how

01:18:17.520 --> 01:18:18.830
we function as communities.

01:18:18.830 --> 01:18:21.758
Yeah.

01:18:21.758 --> 01:18:27.810
- [INAUDIBLE] with myself and
my colleagues [INAUDIBLE] So

01:18:27.810 --> 01:18:30.310
in South Africa, we worked with
the South African government

01:18:30.310 --> 01:18:30.810
quite a bit.

01:18:30.810 --> 01:18:33.400
So what has required
us to actually build

01:18:33.400 --> 01:18:37.260
that relationship well
is listening to them

01:18:37.260 --> 01:18:38.830
and not going in
there as a foreigner

01:18:38.830 --> 01:18:41.740
and forcing whatever
we've believed

01:18:41.740 --> 01:18:44.020
to be either an association
or something that's

01:18:44.020 --> 01:18:46.450
causal on them.

01:18:46.450 --> 01:18:48.750
So it is really listening
and having a conversation.

01:18:48.750 --> 01:18:54.310
And like you said, Sonya, is
doing it incrementally and not

01:18:54.310 --> 01:18:56.260
overloading people
with information,

01:18:56.260 --> 01:18:58.390
because it doesn't help.

01:18:58.390 --> 01:19:00.220
But we have-- it Took.

01:19:00.220 --> 01:19:02.497
A long time for us to
develop these relationships

01:19:02.497 --> 01:19:04.330
with the South African
government and people

01:19:04.330 --> 01:19:07.570
specifically in there
who will help to actually

01:19:07.570 --> 01:19:09.400
have an effect on policy.

01:19:09.400 --> 01:19:12.160
It's that conversation
that's been over the last

01:19:12.160 --> 01:19:14.470
probably decade that has
helped us really kind of

01:19:14.470 --> 01:19:19.414
communicate effectively and
change policy at that level.

01:19:19.414 --> 01:19:21.660
Yeah.

01:19:21.660 --> 01:19:24.210
- I just-- I have a
couple of thoughts.

01:19:24.210 --> 01:19:27.540
I don't have anything additional
to what's already been shared.

01:19:27.540 --> 01:19:29.680
I agree with that.

01:19:29.680 --> 01:19:33.780
At the hospital
where I work, the IRB

01:19:33.780 --> 01:19:36.120
has community members
that sit on it

01:19:36.120 --> 01:19:38.890
as well as studies
that we enroll.

01:19:38.890 --> 01:19:42.150
We usually try to have community
representation to ensure

01:19:42.150 --> 01:19:46.120
that it's asking a question
that people actually care about

01:19:46.120 --> 01:19:48.720
and that it's
represented accurately.

01:19:48.720 --> 01:19:52.080
And some-- just an
anecdote from my own work.

01:19:52.080 --> 01:19:54.390
Before I was doing
this, my dissertation

01:19:54.390 --> 01:19:59.040
was on vaccination and
vaccine-preventable diseases.

01:19:59.040 --> 01:20:02.370
And naive me thought that
everyone would just get

01:20:02.370 --> 01:20:05.250
vaccinated once they
saw this science, right?

01:20:05.250 --> 01:20:08.770
How can you argue against that?

01:20:08.770 --> 01:20:10.830
I'm no longer naive to that.

01:20:10.830 --> 01:20:14.320
And so one thing I think
we can do a better job--

01:20:14.320 --> 01:20:16.770
and I started to do
this-- was let's reach out

01:20:16.770 --> 01:20:19.260
to the anti-vaccination
community

01:20:19.260 --> 01:20:23.310
rather than just scoff at them.

01:20:23.310 --> 01:20:25.717
So I engaged one of
their representatives

01:20:25.717 --> 01:20:26.550
and said, all right.

01:20:26.550 --> 01:20:27.990
What do you propose?

01:20:27.990 --> 01:20:30.810
What do you want to have happen?

01:20:30.810 --> 01:20:34.740
If you are so adamant about
not getting vaccinated,

01:20:34.740 --> 01:20:35.670
what's your proposal?

01:20:35.670 --> 01:20:39.140
Because one thing we can all
agree on is that this is--

01:20:39.140 --> 01:20:41.160
I mean, we don't want--

01:20:41.160 --> 01:20:44.070
we don't want otherwise
preventable diseases

01:20:44.070 --> 01:20:46.471
from making a resurgence
as they're doing now.

01:20:46.471 --> 01:20:47.720
So what are your alternatives?

01:20:47.720 --> 01:20:50.760
It was really an
enlightening conversation

01:20:50.760 --> 01:20:53.490
that I had with this
person, and I actually

01:20:53.490 --> 01:20:56.730
wanted to write this
up and publish it

01:20:56.730 --> 01:20:57.840
in just like a magazine.

01:20:57.840 --> 01:20:59.730
Unfortunately I didn't
get permission from them,

01:20:59.730 --> 01:21:00.480
but it was still--

01:21:00.480 --> 01:21:02.210
I think that's
something that we can do

01:21:02.210 --> 01:21:03.900
is just reach out
and ensure that we

01:21:03.900 --> 01:21:07.470
have a balanced
viewpoint on things, too.

01:21:07.470 --> 01:21:09.420
That we're not just--
because in some ways,

01:21:09.420 --> 01:21:13.980
it is kind of insular in the
community that I work in.

01:21:13.980 --> 01:21:17.430
Like, everyone kind of thinks
alike in the public health

01:21:17.430 --> 01:21:20.180
program, and we all believe
that these are the interventions

01:21:20.180 --> 01:21:21.180
that people should have.

01:21:21.180 --> 01:21:24.030
But it's really interesting
when you get outside of that

01:21:24.030 --> 01:21:27.660
and talk to other people
that have just as strong--

01:21:27.660 --> 01:21:30.780
and are very eloquent
speakers as well--

01:21:30.780 --> 01:21:31.920
opinions to the contrary.

01:21:31.920 --> 01:21:36.030
It's very-- it's helpful to kind
of humble your work in a way

01:21:36.030 --> 01:21:36.550
as well.

01:21:36.550 --> 01:21:37.680
So I think that's--

01:21:37.680 --> 01:21:40.230
to me, at least, like having
community representation

01:21:40.230 --> 01:21:42.120
and having a
dialogue with people

01:21:42.120 --> 01:21:47.040
that are just outside
of your direct role.

01:21:47.040 --> 01:21:48.460
- Well, thank you all very much.

01:21:48.460 --> 01:21:52.329
We've got a reception
outside, so please first

01:21:52.329 --> 01:21:53.870
join me in thanking
actually all four

01:21:53.870 --> 01:21:56.130
of our speakers [INAUDIBLE].

01:21:56.130 --> 01:21:57.630
[APPLAUSE]

01:21:58.230 --> 01:22:00.980
[MUSIC PLAYING]
