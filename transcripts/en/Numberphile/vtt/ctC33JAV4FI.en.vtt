00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:02.700
JAMES GRIME: So recently, we had
big maths news, didn't we?

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:05.100
We had that new prime number
that was found.

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:08.370
And it was the biggest prime
number ever found.

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:09.770
And it was big news.

00:00:09.770 --> 00:00:11.500
And we were all quite
excited about it.

00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:12.700
It was lots of fun.

00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:17.380
But it got me thinking about one
of the classic proofs in

00:00:17.380 --> 00:00:19.960
mathematics, and that is the
proof that there are

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:21.620
infinitely many primes.

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:25.900
So even though we found this
huge, 17-million-digit prime

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:30.090
number, it is still not the
biggest prime number of all.

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:32.590
Because there's infinitely
many of them.

00:00:32.590 --> 00:00:37.190
So shall we do this
classic proof?

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:40.470
So I'll say before I start that
many of you may have seen

00:00:40.470 --> 00:00:41.440
this proof before.

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:42.910
It goes way back.

00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:45.650
But for those who haven't seen
it before, this is what

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:49.630
mathematicians consider an
elegant and a beautiful proof.

00:00:49.630 --> 00:00:52.160
So we're going to prove
infinitely many primes.

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:54.240
To do that, first of
all, we're going

00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:56.130
to assume the opposite.

00:00:56.130 --> 00:00:58.980
So I'm going to say there are
finitely many primes.

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:02.160
So if there's finitely many of
them, we can write a list.

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:03.230
And let's do that.

00:01:03.230 --> 00:01:05.224
And I'm going to call
them prime 1.

00:01:05.224 --> 00:01:07.500
Don't know what it is
particularly, but let's call

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:08.400
it prime 1.

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:14.110
Prime 2, prime 3, and I'll just
go on until I get to the

00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:18.060
last one, which I'll
call prime n.

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:20.340
The point I want to make,
though, is that this is a

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:21.370
complete list.

00:01:21.370 --> 00:01:22.750
So that's important.

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:25.300
OK, the next thing
I'm going to do--

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:26.690
I'm going to make
a new number.

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:27.650
It's a whole number.

00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:32.280
I'm going to call it Q. So let's
call it Q. And to make

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:35.000
this number, I'm going to
multiply all these together--

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:41.110
prime 1 times prime 2 times
prime 3, all the way up to the

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:43.290
last one there, prime n.

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:47.910
So there'll be only one way to
write Q. As a product of

00:01:47.910 --> 00:01:51.410
primes, it's a unique
expression.

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:54.420
So there's only one way
you can write Q.

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:57.330
And then I'm going to add 1.

00:01:57.330 --> 00:01:59.950
Q is either prime,
or it's not.

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:02.230
That's the only options
it has.

00:02:02.230 --> 00:02:06.250
If Q is prime, then it's a new
prime that's not on this list.

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:07.200
That's bad.

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:09.610
So hopefully, it's
not a prime.

00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:13.460
If it's not a prime, then it
is made up from primes by

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:15.620
multiplying primes together.

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:20.550
Now, those prime factors of
Q will divide Q exactly.

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:22.510
And here's the problem--

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:26.420
none of these primes on my
list divide Q exactly.

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:29.720
They'll divide this number
perfectly, but

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:31.620
not this plus 1 number.

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:33.820
You'll always have
1 left over.

00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:38.100
So the prime factors are
not on this list.

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:41.010
So this list is not complete.

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:43.550
I said if there's finitely many
of them, I can have a

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:44.830
complete list.

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:45.980
You cannot.

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:47.290
And that's the proof
that there are

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:49.310
infinitely many primes.

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:51.710
So the definition of a prime
is that it's the building

00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:53.730
blocks of other numbers.

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:55.690
So all other whole numbers
are made by

00:02:55.690 --> 00:02:57.500
multiplying primes together.

00:02:57.500 --> 00:03:00.630
So Q is a whole number,
and it is made by

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:02.740
multiplying primes together.

00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:06.570
And in this case, the problem
is none of the primes on my

00:03:06.570 --> 00:03:08.465
list do that trick.

00:03:08.465 --> 00:03:11.290
They don't divide the
number exactly.

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:12.520
So there's primes missing.

00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:16.910
What I've got here is a copy
of a book called "Euclid's

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:20.720
Elements." And this is a
textbook written by a Greek

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:22.790
mathematician called Euclid.

00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:25.620
Now, Euclid lived in 300 BC.

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:29.920
So this textbook is
2,300 years old.

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:31.840
It's never been out of print.

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:35.090
And it's second only to the
Bible in that respect.

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:38.550
It's one of the most important
books in mathematics.

00:03:38.550 --> 00:03:41.620
It's one of the most important
books in human history.

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:43.930
And the proof that there
are infinitely many

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:45.790
primes is in here.

00:03:45.790 --> 00:03:48.280
And I checked it out earlier.

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:54.580
It was on page 227, which is
Book Nine, Proposition 20.

00:03:54.580 --> 00:03:57.600
And it is right there, the
proof that there are

00:03:57.600 --> 00:03:59.450
infinitely many primes.

00:03:59.450 --> 00:04:01.905
There's a couple of differences
from this proof to

00:04:01.905 --> 00:04:03.440
what I did.

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:07.060
One difference is my proof there
was something called a

00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:08.820
proof by contradiction.

00:04:08.820 --> 00:04:10.690
It's something that
mathematicians do a lot.

00:04:10.690 --> 00:04:12.200
It's really useful.

00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:15.750
What Euclid did was slightly
different.

00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:19.339
He assumed that there was
a list of primes.

00:04:19.339 --> 00:04:21.800
And he said, but you can
keep adding to it.

00:04:21.800 --> 00:04:23.730
So you can never complete
the list, which is the

00:04:23.730 --> 00:04:25.710
same sort of idea.

00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:29.250
The other difference is that
this book was written in the

00:04:29.250 --> 00:04:31.350
days before algebra.

00:04:31.350 --> 00:04:34.750
So he didn't have algebra
to use like I did.

00:04:34.750 --> 00:04:40.090
So all his proofs are using
straight lines and circles.

00:04:40.090 --> 00:04:43.830
So it looks quite different, but
it's actually quite easy

00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:46.680
to translate into
modern terms.

00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:50.290
You see, mathematics is
the search for truth.

00:04:50.290 --> 00:04:55.740
And this book is as true today
as it was 2,300 years ago.

00:04:55.740 --> 00:04:58.510
We know a prime number can
only be divided by 1 and

00:04:58.510 --> 00:05:03.330
itself, by no other factors, so
how did Euclid define it?

00:05:03.330 --> 00:05:04.680
It's actually in here.

00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:07.020
I was quite excited
when I found this.

00:05:07.020 --> 00:05:08.360
So let's have a look.

00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:09.690
In Definitions--

00:05:09.690 --> 00:05:11.000
look here-- at the
beginning of Book

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:12.950
Seven, he defines terms.

00:05:12.950 --> 00:05:14.020
Look at that.

00:05:14.020 --> 00:05:19.040
"A prime number is that which is
measured by a unit alone."

00:05:19.040 --> 00:05:22.930
So only units fit into
the prime number.

00:05:22.930 --> 00:05:27.940
It was all measured with lines,
so a line with length a

00:05:27.940 --> 00:05:30.960
prime can only fit
units into it.

00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:35.740
You can't fit 2's and 3's and
other lengths into it.

00:05:35.740 --> 00:05:38.650
So if we had something that
was prime length--

00:05:38.650 --> 00:05:41.280
let's make it 7.

00:05:41.280 --> 00:05:42.690
There we go--

00:05:42.690 --> 00:05:46.420
then you can fit 1's into it--

00:05:46.420 --> 00:05:52.880
2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7.

00:05:52.880 --> 00:05:55.080
But you wouldn't be able
to fit 2's into it.

00:05:55.080 --> 00:05:56.750
So here's a 2.

00:05:56.750 --> 00:06:03.270
And that would not fit
into my length 7.

00:06:03.270 --> 00:06:08.310
Or if I tried 4's or 3's, it
wouldn't fit into my length 7.

00:06:08.310 --> 00:06:13.320
So a prime length would only fit
units into it and itself.

00:06:13.320 --> 00:06:15.950
And that's the definition
of primes we have today.

00:06:15.950 --> 00:06:18.690
BRADY HARAN: So what does that
mean for that new prime number

00:06:18.690 --> 00:06:20.470
that was found?

00:06:20.470 --> 00:06:21.230
It's just--

00:06:21.230 --> 00:06:21.850
JAMES GRIME: It's tiny.

00:06:21.850 --> 00:06:24.680
That new prime number, 17
million digits long?

00:06:24.680 --> 00:06:25.220
Tiny.

00:06:25.220 --> 00:06:25.670
Nothing.

00:06:25.670 --> 00:06:26.760
Insignificant.

00:06:26.760 --> 00:06:30.800
To the whole infinity of prime
numbers, it is small fry.

00:06:30.800 --> 00:06:32.330
BRADY HARAN: My understanding
is that prime numbers become

00:06:32.330 --> 00:06:34.640
less frequent the
higher you go.

00:06:34.640 --> 00:06:37.285
Their density becomes lower.

00:06:37.285 --> 00:06:40.600
Does that mean the next prime
number is likely to be a long

00:06:40.600 --> 00:06:43.340
way away from those
17 million digits?

00:06:43.340 --> 00:06:44.920
JAMES GRIME: They become
more spaced out.

00:06:44.920 --> 00:06:46.310
You are right about that.

00:06:46.310 --> 00:06:47.350
And there's--

00:06:47.350 --> 00:06:49.640
we're getting into other
things here.

00:06:49.640 --> 00:06:53.810
But there are some fantastic
theories, or theorems, about

00:06:53.810 --> 00:06:57.360
how the prime numbers are spaced
out, the density of

00:06:57.360 --> 00:06:58.860
prime numbers.

00:06:58.860 --> 00:07:01.500
But we are slipping into
other realms there.

00:07:01.500 --> 00:07:02.820
BRADY HARAN: Sounds like
another video.

00:07:02.820 --> 00:07:04.150
JAMES GRIME: It does sound
like another video.

00:07:04.150 --> 00:07:05.400
It'll be a good one, as well.
