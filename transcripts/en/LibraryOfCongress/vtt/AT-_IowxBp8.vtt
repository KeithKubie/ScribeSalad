00:00:00.700 --> 00:00:04.680
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington, DC.

00:00:22.620 --> 00:00:24.350
&gt;&gt; STEPHANIE MARCUS: Good
morning and welcome to the sixth

00:00:24.350 --> 00:00:28.200
of our eight lectures this
year in our NASA series.

00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:30.970
We've got a couple of exciting
ones coming up, but I'm not going

00:00:30.970 --> 00:00:33.690
to tell you about them because
we have a little sheet outside

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:36.530
on the table that tells
you what they are.

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:38.560
I'm Stephanie Marcus
from the Science,

00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:40.810
Technology and Business division.

00:00:40.810 --> 00:00:44.340
And Sean Bryant and I
coordinate this series.

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:45.640
And it's our tenth year.

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:48.890
So, we're having a great time
and we're never going to stop.

00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:51.990
I imagine nobody here
today is too pleased

00:00:51.990 --> 00:00:55.710
with the weather we're having, but
our speaker Alex Young is going

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:59.050
to tell us about the really
nasty weather you might encounter

00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:02.340
when you book your trip to Mars.

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:06.150
Dr. Young's educational
background includes a BS in Physics

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:09.600
from Florida State University,
a Master's in Physics

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:13.660
from the University of New
Hampshire, and also his PhD

00:01:13.660 --> 00:01:16.910
in Physics is from the
University of New Hampshire.

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:22.650
After grad school, he came
to NASA at some point,

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:25.470
and was a solar astrophysicist
and worked

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:29.270
on the NASA European
Space Agency SOHO Mission.

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:31.100
I love the way they
name these missions,

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:32.790
they're always pretty cool.

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:37.700
The SOHO was the Solar and
Heliospheric Observatory.

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:41.260
His current position is
associate director for science

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:44.820
in the Heliophysics Science
Division at NASA Goddard

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:46.940
and he is responsible
there for overseeing

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:48.530
and coordinating the education

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:50.990
and public outreach
team for the division.

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:53.140
But he says now they
pretty much reach

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:57.550
out for all the space sciences
divisions as well as his.

00:01:57.550 --> 00:02:00.790
But he continues his research
in the science of space weather.

00:02:00.790 --> 00:02:04.470
And he's very much into
solar image processing.

00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:07.870
Besides giving lectures,
like this one, and doing TV

00:02:07.870 --> 00:02:12.220
and radio interviews and also
Discovery Channel documentaries,

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:16.920
Dr. Young has established
a website, thesuntoday.org

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:19.620
and it has a companion
Facebook page.

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:21.540
And he's also on Twitter
and YouTube.

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:23.680
So, check him out.

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:24.980
The suntoday.

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:27.500
And now let's get on with
the space weather report.

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:28.800
And welcome Dr. Young.

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:30.100
&gt;&gt; C. ALEX YOUNG: All right.

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:31.400
Thank you.

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:32.790
&gt;&gt; STEPHANIE MARCUS:
You're welcome [applause].

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:34.090
&gt;&gt; C. ALEX YOUNG: Thank
you everyone.

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:36.100
I have to say it's going to be
a little bit difficult for me.

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:37.770
I'm used to moving around.

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:40.050
I don't really stand
still when I give talks.

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:45.020
But I was told because they're
doing the webcast, I have to force

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:48.470
in the urge to get out
and express myself.

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:50.240
So, hopefully I won't
knock anything over.

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:54.000
Because I tend to talk about
big explosions and use my arms.

00:02:54.000 --> 00:03:01.920
But I want to give you a little
bit of perspective into weather,

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:04.200
not here on earth,
but weather in space

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:07.450
in an area we call space weather.

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:12.210
My area of research is
in solar astrophysics.

00:03:12.210 --> 00:03:19.240
I've, for about 12 years, studies
large explosions on the sun,

00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:21.880 position:56%
other starts as well as their impact

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:24.750
through the solar system
and here on earth.

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:28.950
And then after that, as was
mentioned, I got more involved

00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:31.650
in education and public outreach.

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:33.880
But I still do some research.

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:39.100
Right now, for example, I'm looking
at the impacts of space weather

00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:44.590
on data centers, working with, for
example, Google to see what sort

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:47.640
of possible impacts it could
have here, on the ground.

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:53.160 position:56%
But what I want to do today is just
give you a little bit of an overview

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:59.190
and a look at the whole aerospace
weather, where the sun comes

00:03:59.190 --> 00:04:04.950 position:56%
into play, and what sort of
implications that has for the earth,

00:04:04.950 --> 00:04:07.800
for us here on earth,
but in addition

00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:09.930
through the entire solar system.

00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:12.960
Because one of the things that's
really important for NASA,

00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:17.010
in addition to just human
spaceflight is the fact

00:04:17.010 --> 00:04:21.880
that we have a lot of technology
scattered through the solar system.

00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:24.480
Because we're interested in
looking at all sorts of things.

00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:27.800
Everything from planets,
to comets and asteroids.

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:31.830
And the impacts of space
weather, not just here on earth,

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:35.330
but also on the technology that we
have throughout the solar system.

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:39.020
And so, that's one of the areas
that's very important to NASA.

00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:44.990
But to start off, so I want
you to indulge me for a second

00:04:44.990 --> 00:04:49.440
and think a little bit about what
is it you think about the sun.

00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:54.040
You know what is your thought
of the sun on a daily basis.

00:04:54.040 --> 00:05:00.210 position:56%
Close your eyes, maybe, and when you
think about the sun, maybe you think

00:05:00.210 --> 00:05:04.930
about sunrise or sunset, or
you know, what's your sort

00:05:04.930 --> 00:05:09.110
of general thoughts about it.

00:05:09.110 --> 00:05:15.500
Now, this may be the kind
of image that comes to mind.

00:05:15.500 --> 00:05:19.110
Or even let's say you
put a camera up,

00:05:19.110 --> 00:05:21.310
you might get something like this.

00:05:21.310 --> 00:05:23.940
There's all kinds of
cool things you can see.

00:05:23.940 --> 00:05:25.980
Sometimes you can see
halos around the sun

00:05:25.980 --> 00:05:29.040
from ice crystals,
that sort of stuff.

00:05:29.040 --> 00:05:33.020
But also, you may think about it
as, let's say you have a telescope

00:05:33.020 --> 00:05:37.660
and you do some safe solar
viewing, with appropriate kind

00:05:37.660 --> 00:05:39.530
of filter, look at the sun.

00:05:39.530 --> 00:05:41.960
You may see something
a little bit like this.

00:05:41.960 --> 00:05:43.920
Still, it's not really
that exciting.

00:05:43.920 --> 00:05:45.220
It's kind of boring.

00:05:45.220 --> 00:05:47.220
Sort of a yellow disk.

00:05:47.220 --> 00:05:49.570
If you look at it long enough,
you'll notice there are things

00:05:49.570 --> 00:05:51.970
that are moving across the surface.

00:05:51.970 --> 00:05:53.820
These are called sunspots.

00:05:53.820 --> 00:05:57.690
You can sometimes see them with
the naked eye with solar glasses

00:05:57.690 --> 00:05:59.140
like the ones that are outside.

00:05:59.140 --> 00:06:00.530
If you look up at the sun,

00:06:00.530 --> 00:06:03.540
when there's a large enough
sunspot, you can see these.

00:06:03.540 --> 00:06:07.770
To give you some perspective, this
is about the size of the earth,

00:06:07.770 --> 00:06:09.330
that sunspot right there, okay?

00:06:09.330 --> 00:06:11.880
That's a decent size sunspot.

00:06:11.880 --> 00:06:15.010
Not too big, not too small.

00:06:15.010 --> 00:06:16.790
The other thing you notice here,

00:06:16.790 --> 00:06:18.410
which you don't necessarily
notice maybe

00:06:18.410 --> 00:06:21.280
on a daily basis is we see
the sun move through the sky,

00:06:21.280 --> 00:06:23.220
but you may not even
think about the fact

00:06:23.220 --> 00:06:26.140
that it rotates, just
like other planets.

00:06:26.140 --> 00:06:27.470
The sun is spinning.

00:06:27.470 --> 00:06:30.760
We're rotating around it,
but it is also spinning.

00:06:30.760 --> 00:06:35.200
Now, there is one time when you
can really see something more

00:06:35.200 --> 00:06:41.210
interesting on the sun and that
is during a total solar eclipse.

00:06:41.210 --> 00:06:45.780
So, the first time
that humans realized

00:06:45.780 --> 00:06:47.820
that there's a little bit
more interesting stuff going

00:06:47.820 --> 00:06:53.040
on is not just these sunspots,
but something like this.

00:06:53.040 --> 00:07:00.680
Okay. So here the moon has blocked
out the sun almost completely.

00:07:00.680 --> 00:07:03.270
And you will see there's
a little spot there.

00:07:03.270 --> 00:07:06.230
This actually doesn't quite show
up, but this is in fact red.

00:07:06.230 --> 00:07:10.090
If you look at that, that
little piece that's sticking

00:07:10.090 --> 00:07:12.620
out on the edge there is red.

00:07:12.620 --> 00:07:14.750
You see all this structure.

00:07:14.750 --> 00:07:16.460
Now, this is cheating a little bit,

00:07:16.460 --> 00:07:18.820
they've taken a couple
images and overlaid them.

00:07:18.820 --> 00:07:24.360
You will see this wispy structure
if you look at it from the ground,

00:07:24.360 --> 00:07:27.670
you don't quite see
this fine detail.

00:07:27.670 --> 00:07:32.210
But you will see this sort of
wispy halo structure that comes

00:07:32.210 --> 00:07:36.880
out of the sun during this
brief period we call totality,

00:07:36.880 --> 00:07:39.260
when it is in fact safe
to look at the sun.

00:07:39.260 --> 00:07:43.450
If you are, I'm sure you've
all heard you should never look

00:07:43.450 --> 00:07:47.140
at the sun without the
appropriate equipment or glasses,

00:07:47.140 --> 00:07:49.830
or filters if you're
using a telescope.

00:07:49.830 --> 00:07:53.570
But in fact, during a total
solar eclipse, usually a period

00:07:53.570 --> 00:07:55.290
of somewhere between
a couple minutes,

00:07:55.290 --> 00:07:58.200
maybe the longest one
recently was about 7 minutes,

00:07:58.200 --> 00:08:00.800
it is safe to look at the sun.

00:08:00.800 --> 00:08:04.440
And this is something you would
see only with your naked eye.

00:08:04.440 --> 00:08:07.500
You would not see this if
you used those solar glasses.

00:08:07.500 --> 00:08:08.800
They would completely
block this out.

00:08:08.800 --> 00:08:12.790
As a matter of fact, you wouldn't
see anything with the solar glasses

00:08:12.790 --> 00:08:14.380
on during the total solar eclipse.

00:08:14.380 --> 00:08:16.330
But you see all this
structure, and this was sort

00:08:16.330 --> 00:08:19.900 position:56%
of the first indication that there's
something interesting going on.

00:08:19.900 --> 00:08:21.950
The sun is a little bit
more exciting than this sort

00:08:21.950 --> 00:08:25.000
of this yellow disk in the sky.

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:30.400
But if we step outside
of our atmosphere.

00:08:30.400 --> 00:08:35.070
Let's go up into space, use a
spacecraft, and telescopes in space

00:08:35.070 --> 00:08:40.310
to look at the sun, we get
a different perspective.

00:08:40.310 --> 00:08:42.950
This is what we see.

00:08:42.950 --> 00:08:47.410
This is a lot different than
what it looks like on the ground.

00:08:47.410 --> 00:08:53.040
Now, in this case you see there's
all of this amazing structure

00:08:53.040 --> 00:08:57.500
and everywhere you look on the
sun there's something happening.

00:08:57.500 --> 00:09:00.460
From the tiniest scales you can see

00:09:00.460 --> 00:09:03.870
to the things almost the
size of the entire sun.

00:09:03.870 --> 00:09:07.270
You see, when there is this
flash, you'll see this flash

00:09:07.270 --> 00:09:09.550
of light when it recycles.

00:09:09.550 --> 00:09:12.740
And you see this structure
that looks like it's moving

00:09:12.740 --> 00:09:16.480
across the whole sun,
that is in fact a wave.

00:09:16.480 --> 00:09:20.460
There is an explosion that sends
a wave across the entire surface

00:09:20.460 --> 00:09:24.680
of the sun traveling several
million miles an hour.

00:09:24.680 --> 00:09:27.010
That's a result of
that explosion you saw.

00:09:27.010 --> 00:09:30.930
So, that flash you
saw was a solar flare.

00:09:30.930 --> 00:09:35.480
An extremely intense
release of energy of light

00:09:35.480 --> 00:09:37.830
over the entire spectrum.

00:09:37.830 --> 00:09:42.130 position:56%
Okay, not just the visible
spectrum that we see, but everything

00:09:42.130 --> 00:09:47.020
from infrared, to radio
to do microwave,

00:09:47.020 --> 00:09:49.910
or in the other direction,
ultraviolet,

00:09:49.910 --> 00:09:52.770
extreme ultraviolet,
x-rays, even gamma rays.

00:09:52.770 --> 00:09:57.570 position:56%
So, the sun puts out energy through
the entire electromagnetic spectrum.

00:09:57.570 --> 00:09:59.780
So, that was a solar flare.

00:09:59.780 --> 00:10:04.060
But you also see all of this
stuff moving and wiggling around.

00:10:04.060 --> 00:10:06.630
And you see right here
something moves.

00:10:06.630 --> 00:10:09.640
There's a big structure that
actually erupts from the sun.

00:10:09.640 --> 00:10:12.100
We're going to look at it shortly
from a different perspective.

00:10:12.100 --> 00:10:14.560
It's kind of hard to see
from this perspective.

00:10:14.560 --> 00:10:19.350
But you're actually going to see
things flying away from the sun.

00:10:19.350 --> 00:10:23.320
What's happening here is not
only is the sun exploding

00:10:23.320 --> 00:10:25.790
and releasing this
light, the solar flare.

00:10:25.790 --> 00:10:30.520
But it's actually throwing off
billions of tons of its material

00:10:30.520 --> 00:10:33.100
at many millions of miles an hour.

00:10:33.100 --> 00:10:36.720
It's traveling away from the
sun through the solar system.

00:10:36.720 --> 00:10:40.600
Sometimes to us, sometimes
to other parts.

00:10:40.600 --> 00:10:43.730
The other thing, and this is where
I tend to want to run out and try

00:10:43.730 --> 00:10:45.080
to show you with my arms.

00:10:45.080 --> 00:10:46.890
I'll try to do this
without going anywhere.

00:10:46.890 --> 00:10:52.240
But, when that big blast of
material comes away from the sun,

00:10:52.240 --> 00:10:54.280
it's traveling so fast,

00:10:54.280 --> 00:10:57.090
it's scooping up everything
in front of it.

00:10:57.090 --> 00:10:59.300 position:56%
Because space is actually not empty.

00:10:59.300 --> 00:11:00.840
And I'll talk more about that.

00:11:00.840 --> 00:11:03.640
There's particles and
there's material out there

00:11:03.640 --> 00:11:08.320 position:56%
and it get scooped up like a
snowplow and pushed incredibly fast.

00:11:08.320 --> 00:11:13.030
And there's also this huge blast
of particles that get accelerated

00:11:13.030 --> 00:11:15.380
to near the speed of light.

00:11:15.380 --> 00:11:18.360
And I'll show you what
that looks like shortly.

00:11:18.360 --> 00:11:21.560
But those are three
parts of space weather.

00:11:21.560 --> 00:11:26.380
So, there's the flash, the solar
flare, enough energy is released

00:11:26.380 --> 00:11:30.040
in a moderate size solar
flare to power the world,

00:11:30.040 --> 00:11:34.810
the entire globe for 100,000 years.

00:11:34.810 --> 00:11:38.630
Okay? And now if you want to
get in terms of explosions,

00:11:38.630 --> 00:11:42.260
that billions of atomic bombs.

00:11:42.260 --> 00:11:44.970
Of World War II size atomic bombs.

00:11:44.970 --> 00:11:48.290
That's the amount of
energy released in that.

00:11:48.290 --> 00:11:51.290
The amount of energy released
in that stuff that's thrown out,

00:11:51.290 --> 00:11:53.740
we call that a coronal
mass ejection.

00:11:53.740 --> 00:11:56.450
The outer atmosphere of the
sun is called the corona.

00:11:56.450 --> 00:11:58.920
And this is just mass,
stuff that's thrown out.

00:11:58.920 --> 00:12:02.650
It's not just material, but it's
also magnetic fields and I'll talk

00:12:02.650 --> 00:12:07.760
about that soon, because that's a
very key feature, magnetic fields.

00:12:07.760 --> 00:12:10.330
That coronal mass ejection
has almost as much,

00:12:10.330 --> 00:12:14.110
or if not more energy
sometimes than that flare.

00:12:14.110 --> 00:12:17.840
And then there's those particles
that are accelerated away.

00:12:17.840 --> 00:12:20.610
So, those are three
parts of space weather.

00:12:20.610 --> 00:12:24.260
And we'll talk a little bit
about what the implications

00:12:24.260 --> 00:12:25.970
of those are, what they do.

00:12:25.970 --> 00:12:30.820
But why do we want to look
at the sun from space?

00:12:30.820 --> 00:12:32.500
Well, you can see here,
there's an awful lot

00:12:32.500 --> 00:12:34.650
of structure you see
that's happening.

00:12:34.650 --> 00:12:40.730
It turns out that when you go
into space and you use a set

00:12:40.730 --> 00:12:44.050
of telescopes that look at
different wavelengths of light,

00:12:44.050 --> 00:12:47.390
you can see the sun is
vastly different depending

00:12:47.390 --> 00:12:49.250
on the wavelength of
light you look at.

00:12:49.250 --> 00:12:54.820
So, this yellow part is the
visible sun, you see the sunspots.

00:12:54.820 --> 00:12:58.510
But as we move around
we go from ultraviolet

00:12:58.510 --> 00:13:03.200
to extreme ultraviolet,
to near x-ray energies.

00:13:03.200 --> 00:13:07.230
And you see as you're cycling
around, you see that depending

00:13:07.230 --> 00:13:11.480
on the wavelength of light,
what you see is very different.

00:13:11.480 --> 00:13:16.070 position:56%
Now, these colors are artificial,
because really we're looking at part

00:13:16.070 --> 00:13:17.610
of light that's not visible.

00:13:17.610 --> 00:13:20.460 position:56%
So, color, there really is no color.

00:13:20.460 --> 00:13:22.900
They're actually black and
white or grayscale images,

00:13:22.900 --> 00:13:27.130
but we've colored them, because
that tells us as a scientist,

00:13:27.130 --> 00:13:29.190
I can look at any one of
those colors and I know

00:13:29.190 --> 00:13:31.160
which wavelength of light that is.

00:13:31.160 --> 00:13:32.740
And why is that important?

00:13:32.740 --> 00:13:37.190
Because each one of these not only
shows us different structures,

00:13:37.190 --> 00:13:41.780
what it in fact is showing is
different temperatures of the sun.

00:13:41.780 --> 00:13:47.400
So, the surface of the sun
here is about 10,000 degrees,

00:13:47.400 --> 00:13:51.320
but as we move up this
is about 20,000.

00:13:51.320 --> 00:13:55.110
This is somewhere between
40 to 80,000.

00:13:55.110 --> 00:13:57.790
This is a million.

00:13:57.790 --> 00:14:01.770
This is 10 million degrees.

00:14:01.770 --> 00:14:10.290 position:56%
So, as you move out from the surface
of the sun, the visible surface,

00:14:10.290 --> 00:14:12.650
you're actually going
up in temperature.

00:14:12.650 --> 00:14:16.880
So, you're also moving
higher in the atmosphere.

00:14:16.880 --> 00:14:22.120
Okay. So, this outer part, all of
this part here, this is the corona.

00:14:22.120 --> 00:14:25.700
The part that you saw during
the total solar eclipse.

00:14:25.700 --> 00:14:32.350
But now, we're seeing all of
those wispy structures and detail,

00:14:32.350 --> 00:14:35.030
you're seeing it actually
connect back to the sun,

00:14:35.030 --> 00:14:38.500
because before you were just
seeing, not the disk of the sun,

00:14:38.500 --> 00:14:40.570
but sort of the outer atmosphere.

00:14:40.570 --> 00:14:42.950
Okay. So, that's why
we go out in space.

00:14:42.950 --> 00:14:44.880
Because for example,
watch that sunspot

00:14:44.880 --> 00:14:48.950
and see how it changes
as you move around.

00:14:48.950 --> 00:14:54.140
It actually gets brighter right
here, it's brighter there.

00:14:54.140 --> 00:14:58.710
Here's another thing, you'll
notice these loop like structures

00:14:58.710 --> 00:15:02.430
and we're going to come back to
that, but in fact those are related

00:15:02.430 --> 00:15:04.840
to these magnetic fields
that I was talking about.

00:15:04.840 --> 00:15:08.160
So, let's look at some detail
in these different wavelengths.

00:15:08.160 --> 00:15:10.830
I'm going to pick a couple
of them, one that's going

00:15:10.830 --> 00:15:13.470
to show us the million degrees
and one that's going to show us

00:15:13.470 --> 00:15:17.120
about the 80,000, 100,000 degrees.

00:15:17.120 --> 00:15:20.690
So, this is roughly
a million degrees.

00:15:21.730 --> 00:15:25.000
All of these bright patches
are where the sunspots are.

00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:29.880
We're now looking in extreme
ultraviolet, not visible light,

00:15:29.880 --> 00:15:34.390 position:56%
and where they were dark in visible
light, they're actually very bright,

00:15:34.390 --> 00:15:36.610
because they're very hot.

00:15:36.610 --> 00:15:40.310
And so, that the material
is glowing.

00:15:40.310 --> 00:15:42.290
It is so hot that it's glowing.

00:15:42.290 --> 00:15:43.870
Millions of degrees.

00:15:43.870 --> 00:15:47.530
And then you see these loops.

00:15:47.530 --> 00:15:50.020
Those are magnetic fields.

00:15:50.020 --> 00:15:54.100
Now, magnetic fields you know
the invisible force that you feel

00:15:54.100 --> 00:15:57.760 position:56%
when you take a magnet and stick it
on your refrigerator and it holds it

00:15:57.760 --> 00:16:03.650
to the refrigerator, that's
an invisible force, but here,

00:16:03.650 --> 00:16:06.470
we're not actually seeing
the magnetic fields directly,

00:16:06.470 --> 00:16:10.440
we're seeing the material follow
along the magnetic fields.

00:16:10.440 --> 00:16:13.960
Magnetic fields are invisible,
but the material the sun is made

00:16:13.960 --> 00:16:16.070
up of is electromagnetic.

00:16:16.070 --> 00:16:18.830
It responds to magnetic fields.

00:16:18.830 --> 00:16:26.190 position:56%
And so, the magnetic fields collect
that stuff, that material on the sun

00:16:26.190 --> 00:16:29.370
and it traces them out,
so you can see them.

00:16:29.370 --> 00:16:32.660
Normally you wouldn't
be able to see them.

00:16:32.660 --> 00:16:35.930
Now, just so you know that
material is called a plasma.

00:16:35.930 --> 00:16:38.090
We won't go into the
details of that,

00:16:38.090 --> 00:16:40.940
but that's actually what
happens when you heat something

00:16:40.940 --> 00:16:43.380
up to super, super
high temperatures.

00:16:43.380 --> 00:16:48.750 position:56%
It actually goes from, if you take
for example water, starts off as ice

00:16:48.750 --> 00:16:51.150 position:56%
when it's very cold, that's a solid.

00:16:51.150 --> 00:16:53.780
You heat it up a little
bit, it turns into a liquid.

00:16:53.780 --> 00:16:57.010
You heat it up even more
it turns into a gas.

00:16:57.010 --> 00:17:01.580
Well, if you heat it up a lot more,
it actually turns into a plasma

00:17:01.580 --> 00:17:03.660
and that's the fourth
state of matter.

00:17:03.660 --> 00:17:06.350 position:56%
So, there are four states of matter.

00:17:06.350 --> 00:17:08.490
We, here on earth live
in an environment

00:17:08.490 --> 00:17:14.150
where plasma is actually rare,
but in fact, through the universe.

00:17:14.150 --> 00:17:17.900
All of the visible material
that we see is mostly plasma.

00:17:17.900 --> 00:17:21.930
Plasma is the predominant form
of matter in the universe,

00:17:21.930 --> 00:17:24.100
visible matter that we see.

00:17:24.100 --> 00:17:28.060
That's not getting into the kind
of crazy stuff like dark matter.

00:17:28.060 --> 00:17:30.570
But the visible matter that we see.

00:17:30.570 --> 00:17:34.570
Stars and nebulas and
galaxies and all that.

00:17:34.570 --> 00:17:35.940
It's all plasma.

00:17:35.940 --> 00:17:37.490
And that's what the
sun is made up of.

00:17:37.490 --> 00:17:41.200
And the cool thing about plasma,
it acts like a liquid in a gas,

00:17:41.200 --> 00:17:43.150
but it's electromagnetic.

00:17:43.150 --> 00:17:45.820
It responds to electricity
and magnetism.

00:17:45.820 --> 00:17:48.260
And that's really a
key feature to it.

00:17:48.260 --> 00:17:51.910
And here it acts as a tracer
for these magnetic fields.

00:17:51.910 --> 00:17:54.560
Let's look at slightly
cooler temperature.

00:17:54.560 --> 00:17:57.720
Slightly lower down
in the atmosphere.

00:17:57.720 --> 00:18:02.390
This is about 100,000.

00:18:02.390 --> 00:18:06.420
Somewhere between 40
to 100,000 degrees.

00:18:06.420 --> 00:18:11.760 position:56%
And, here, you're seeing something
similar to those loops that you saw.

00:18:11.760 --> 00:18:15.780
But what you're seeing here is
material that's being supported

00:18:15.780 --> 00:18:18.140
above the surface of the
sun by magnetic fields.

00:18:18.140 --> 00:18:22.430
So, if you remember back
when I mentioned during

00:18:22.430 --> 00:18:25.850
that total solar eclipse at the
very top there's this little stuff

00:18:25.850 --> 00:18:27.150
sticking out.

00:18:27.150 --> 00:18:30.180
And I said actually it's really
red, it's kind of hard to see.

00:18:30.180 --> 00:18:31.920
This is the material.

00:18:31.920 --> 00:18:34.240
That's actually why they
choose to color this red.

00:18:34.240 --> 00:18:38.010
This is a false color, but
this is the same material shown

00:18:38.010 --> 00:18:39.690
in a different wavelength.

00:18:39.690 --> 00:18:42.100
And it is in fact red
in visible light.

00:18:42.100 --> 00:18:45.730
It's called a prominence.

00:18:45.730 --> 00:18:49.530
And that's something you can see
during a total solar eclipse,

00:18:49.530 --> 00:18:53.900
but now you can also see when
you look at the sun from space.

00:18:53.900 --> 00:19:01.550 position:56%
Again, here is a sunspot and you see
there are these little tiny loops

00:19:01.550 --> 00:19:03.420
they are connecting the sunspots.

00:19:03.420 --> 00:19:08.660
So, I won't go into to a detail but
the thing to think about sunspots,

00:19:08.660 --> 00:19:11.950
now if you're at all familiar
with the idea of a bar magnet.

00:19:11.950 --> 00:19:15.910
Okay if you've ever seen a
bar magnet, or even seen,

00:19:15.910 --> 00:19:18.860
maybe in a class where you take
a bar magnet and you put it next

00:19:18.860 --> 00:19:22.780
to some iron filing, and it sort of
traces out these invisible lines.

00:19:22.780 --> 00:19:26.170
That's really what's happening
when you saw those loops.

00:19:26.170 --> 00:19:29.530
Same sort of principle.

00:19:29.530 --> 00:19:32.870
And a magnet, like a
bar magnet is a type

00:19:32.870 --> 00:19:35.010
of magnet that's a
very simple structure,

00:19:35.010 --> 00:19:37.010 position:56%
and it has a positive or a negative.

00:19:37.010 --> 00:19:41.340 position:56%
It has a north or a south, depending
on how you want to label it.

00:19:41.340 --> 00:19:48.350
And so, the magnetic field lines
go from one pole plus or north

00:19:48.350 --> 00:19:51.620
to the other pole, minus or south.

00:19:51.620 --> 00:19:53.250
And the earth is the same way.

00:19:53.250 --> 00:19:55.940
You can think of the earth
as a sort of a bar magnet.

00:19:55.940 --> 00:19:59.200
It has a north pole and a south
pole, that's where it spins.

00:19:59.200 --> 00:20:01.520
But it also has a magnetic pole.

00:20:01.520 --> 00:20:05.410
And so, the magnetic field lines
go from one pole to the other.

00:20:05.410 --> 00:20:06.710
They connect them.

00:20:06.710 --> 00:20:08.600
And that's why you see these loops.

00:20:08.600 --> 00:20:11.810
Because the sunspots
are actually connected.

00:20:11.810 --> 00:20:14.790
One sunspot has a magnetic
field line that's going

00:20:14.790 --> 00:20:16.310
to another sunspot.

00:20:16.310 --> 00:20:19.990
And they're almost like
bar magnets on the side.

00:20:19.990 --> 00:20:24.330
So, on the surface you'll see, you
know magnetic fields do like this,

00:20:24.330 --> 00:20:27.310
they make these loops that
you see coming out of the sun.

00:20:27.310 --> 00:20:32.060 position:56%
And the reason that I wanted to
bring that up, is that is the driver

00:20:32.060 --> 00:20:34.580
of all of this energy that's
coming away from the sun.

00:20:34.580 --> 00:20:35.880
It's magnetic fields.

00:20:35.880 --> 00:20:39.200
I'm going to show you
a cartoon animation

00:20:39.200 --> 00:20:41.840
to give you some more
detail what's happening.

00:20:41.840 --> 00:20:44.700
But magnetic fields are
kind of like rubber bands.

00:20:44.700 --> 00:20:48.470
They have tension,
they have pressure.

00:20:48.470 --> 00:20:51.740
You take a rubber band you
take it, twist it, twist it,

00:20:51.740 --> 00:20:53.470
twist it it's going
to start to knot up.

00:20:53.470 --> 00:20:56.250
I actually used to give the analogy

00:20:56.250 --> 00:20:59.190
of phone cords, but
then nobody knows.

00:20:59.190 --> 00:21:02.040
At a certain age, nobody knows
what a phone cord is anymore.

00:21:02.040 --> 00:21:05.730
But we all remember when
we had long phone cords

00:21:05.730 --> 00:21:07.780
and over time they
would get all knotted up

00:21:07.780 --> 00:21:09.470
and become very difficult.

00:21:09.470 --> 00:21:11.660
Well that's actually a
similar sort of thing.

00:21:11.660 --> 00:21:15.540
So, these magnetic fields on
the sun are getting all twisted.

00:21:15.540 --> 00:21:20.280 position:56%
So, when you saw the sunspots
moving across the sun, as they move,

00:21:20.280 --> 00:21:22.820
they actually get all
twisted and knotted up.

00:21:22.820 --> 00:21:25.720
And if they get knotted up
enough, if you take rubber band

00:21:25.720 --> 00:21:27.020
and you twist it, and twist it,

00:21:27.020 --> 00:21:29.320
and twist it eventually
it's going to pop.

00:21:29.320 --> 00:21:31.000
That energy's got to go somewhere.

00:21:31.000 --> 00:21:33.480
It can only hold so much.

00:21:33.480 --> 00:21:36.890
Magnetic fields are very
similar in that way.

00:21:36.890 --> 00:21:41.280
As they get twisted and they
build up energy at some point

00:21:41.280 --> 00:21:43.220
that energy's got to go somewhere.

00:21:43.220 --> 00:21:44.880
And what happens?

00:21:44.880 --> 00:21:47.850 position:56%
That energy is released explosively.

00:21:47.850 --> 00:21:50.680
And bam. You see the solar
flare and you see all

00:21:50.680 --> 00:21:52.770
that material come flying away.

00:21:52.770 --> 00:21:57.370
So, that's what's happening when
we have those eruptions on the sun.

00:21:57.370 --> 00:22:01.790
They're releasing this magnetic
energy that's getting built

00:22:01.790 --> 00:22:05.990
up as the magnetic fields are
getting all twisted and knotted.

00:22:05.990 --> 00:22:11.250
So, I love this this little, this
actually got cut off because I had

00:22:11.250 --> 00:22:14.860
to change the aspect
ratio of the talk,

00:22:14.860 --> 00:22:17.140
but I love this little cartoon.

00:22:17.140 --> 00:22:20.400
Basically, it says, an increase
in sunspots is an indicator

00:22:20.400 --> 00:22:23.150
of potentially dangerous
solar activity.

00:22:23.150 --> 00:22:25.780
And at the very end the
guy looks at it and says,

00:22:25.780 --> 00:22:28.090
I don't like the looks of this.

00:22:28.090 --> 00:22:31.490
So, it's actually not
so far from the truth.

00:22:31.490 --> 00:22:35.510
As you start to see more
sunspots, bigger sunspots,

00:22:35.510 --> 00:22:38.960
very complicated sunspots, that
means they have more energy built

00:22:38.960 --> 00:22:43.980
up inside of them and
more potential to explode.

00:22:43.980 --> 00:22:50.820 position:56%
And in fact, we see the number of
sunspots over time goes up and down.

00:22:50.820 --> 00:22:55.290
Goes from very low number of
sunspots, to high number back

00:22:55.290 --> 00:22:59.270
down to low, roughly
every 11 years from low,

00:22:59.270 --> 00:23:01.480
high to low is roughly
every 11 years.

00:23:01.480 --> 00:23:04.710
Sometimes it's shorter,
maybe 10 and a half, 10.

00:23:04.710 --> 00:23:06.430
Sometimes it's a little bit longer.

00:23:06.430 --> 00:23:08.510
But that's called the solar cycle.

00:23:08.510 --> 00:23:10.480
Solar activity cycle.

00:23:10.480 --> 00:23:13.220
And people have been
watching sunspots

00:23:13.220 --> 00:23:16.660
since the mid to early 1700s.

00:23:16.660 --> 00:23:18.840
Actually, they've been watching
them much longer than that.

00:23:18.840 --> 00:23:22.340
They've been watching them for
hundreds, potentially thousands

00:23:22.340 --> 00:23:25.250
of years, but we've
been recording them.

00:23:25.250 --> 00:23:29.980
In Europe, they started recording
them back in the early 1700s.

00:23:29.980 --> 00:23:35.270 position:56%
And, though the data got better over
time, they did a pretty good job

00:23:35.270 --> 00:23:37.930 position:56%
and they kept really decent records.

00:23:37.930 --> 00:23:41.910
We can go back and we
see this up and down.

00:23:41.910 --> 00:23:47.660
We see some peaks are higher, you
know one solar cycle may be higher

00:23:47.660 --> 00:23:49.520
than the next one,
a little bit lower.

00:23:49.520 --> 00:23:52.060
Some are a little bit
longer, a little bit shorter.

00:23:52.060 --> 00:23:55.000
As a matter of fact, right
now, we're in what we call,

00:23:55.000 --> 00:23:59.480
since we started numbering
them, we're in cycle 24.

00:23:59.480 --> 00:24:03.070
And we're coming down off the peak.

00:24:03.070 --> 00:24:10.010
Somewhere around 2012, 2013 was
the peak of the current cycle, 24.

00:24:10.010 --> 00:24:14.910
And this cycle turns out to be
the smallest cycle in 100 years.

00:24:14.910 --> 00:24:16.960
So, it's a relatively small cycle.

00:24:16.960 --> 00:24:18.690
But we still see solar activity.

00:24:18.690 --> 00:24:21.900
It's just compared
to the previous one.

00:24:21.900 --> 00:24:23.530
And they go up and down.

00:24:23.530 --> 00:24:26.270
Sometimes we see a big
one and another big one,

00:24:26.270 --> 00:24:29.710
and another big one, and then
a little bit smaller one.

00:24:29.710 --> 00:24:33.300
We don't really have a good handle
of what pattern exists there.

00:24:33.300 --> 00:24:35.420
You're going to hear in the news
every so often somebody's going

00:24:35.420 --> 00:24:38.420
to say, we're going to go into
this next great solar minimum

00:24:38.420 --> 00:24:39.890
and everything's going to freeze up

00:24:39.890 --> 00:24:42.520
and you know the sun
is doing this and that.

00:24:42.520 --> 00:24:44.870
Well, the reality is they
don't really know what they're

00:24:44.870 --> 00:24:46.170
talking about.

00:24:46.170 --> 00:24:47.470
Because nobody knows.

00:24:47.470 --> 00:24:49.490
Because the sun's been doing
this for billions of years.

00:24:49.490 --> 00:24:51.350
And we've only been watching it

00:24:51.350 --> 00:24:53.650
for a couple hundred years
in that kind of detail.

00:24:53.650 --> 00:24:59.230 position:56%
So, there's no way we can truly
understand what that pattern is yet.

00:24:59.230 --> 00:25:00.820
We get a little bit
of a handle on it

00:25:00.820 --> 00:25:03.080
and we start trying to
put some physics in.

00:25:03.080 --> 00:25:05.310
But we really don't
understand that too well.

00:25:05.310 --> 00:25:09.720
Now, I'm going to show you a couple
of quick examples of sunspots.

00:25:09.720 --> 00:25:12.860
This is zooming in with a very
high resolution telescope.

00:25:12.860 --> 00:25:16.220
Happened to be one that I worked
for in Japan called Hinoday.

00:25:16.220 --> 00:25:23.190 position:56%
And just to give you some size
scale again, so those little dimples

00:25:23.190 --> 00:25:26.800
that you see wiggling,
okay that's real.

00:25:26.800 --> 00:25:33.040
Turns out that the energy from
inside the sun moves to the surface

00:25:33.040 --> 00:25:34.340
and when it gets close

00:25:34.340 --> 00:25:37.360
to the surface it actually does
what's called a convection cell,

00:25:37.360 --> 00:25:39.920
just like boiling water.

00:25:39.920 --> 00:25:44.450
The energy rises to the surface,
releases, cool back down.

00:25:44.450 --> 00:25:48.030
And it makes these, what we call
convection cells, these bubbles.

00:25:48.030 --> 00:25:49.630
So, you see those little wiggles.

00:25:49.630 --> 00:25:50.980
Those are real.

00:25:50.980 --> 00:25:56.560
And they're all about the size of
Texas just to give you some scale.

00:25:56.560 --> 00:25:58.180
So, that's a sunspot.

00:25:58.180 --> 00:26:01.980
You saw this flash there, there
was actually a visible flash.

00:26:01.980 --> 00:26:04.420
That actually is an indication
it was a very strong solar flare.

00:26:04.420 --> 00:26:08.400
We don't generally see solar
flares very well in visible light.

00:26:08.400 --> 00:26:09.700
This is visible light.

00:26:09.700 --> 00:26:12.990 position:56%
So, when you see that flash over it,
that actually means it's pretty big.

00:26:12.990 --> 00:26:17.370
Here's another idea of
the scale of sunspots.

00:26:17.370 --> 00:26:20.170
Again, you see these
sunspots are very complicated.

00:26:20.170 --> 00:26:22.060
They're messy.

00:26:22.060 --> 00:26:23.360
And that's actually an indication

00:26:23.360 --> 00:26:26.750
that the there's energy
stored up in them.

00:26:26.750 --> 00:26:31.240
When you see a nice simple
round sunspot, it's boring.

00:26:31.240 --> 00:26:32.540
There's really not much to it.

00:26:32.540 --> 00:26:33.840
It means there's not
a lot of energy.

00:26:33.840 --> 00:26:37.780
But as they start to get
elongated and get kind of gnarly

00:26:37.780 --> 00:26:40.500
and broken up, that's
actually a sin of complexity

00:26:40.500 --> 00:26:44.280 position:56%
and that means there's energy there.

00:26:44.280 --> 00:26:48.840
Now, I mentioned that one of
the keys is magnetic fields.

00:26:48.840 --> 00:26:54.800
But there's another key about the
energy that's stored up in the sun

00:26:54.800 --> 00:26:58.110
and what creates the dynamics
that makes space weather.

00:26:58.110 --> 00:27:02.170
And it's something, I'm going
to show you a cartoon animation,

00:27:02.170 --> 00:27:04.770
but it's something called
differential rotation.

00:27:04.770 --> 00:27:07.300 position:56%
So, think for a second about planets

00:27:07.300 --> 00:27:10.570
like Jupiter, Saturn,
the gas giants.

00:27:10.570 --> 00:27:12.760
Okay. These are not solid planets.

00:27:12.760 --> 00:27:16.600 position:56%
When they rotate, they rotate faster

00:27:16.600 --> 00:27:22.020
as they get towards the
equator they rotate faster.

00:27:22.020 --> 00:27:24.660
As you move towards the
poles they rotate slower.

00:27:24.660 --> 00:27:26.410
That's why you see
those bands for example.

00:27:26.410 --> 00:27:27.950
Because they're not solid.

00:27:27.950 --> 00:27:29.420
Well, the sun is not solid.

00:27:29.420 --> 00:27:31.930
The sun is a plasma as I mentioned.

00:27:31.930 --> 00:27:37.030
And so, that means that it doesn't
rotate at the same rate when you're

00:27:37.030 --> 00:27:39.480
at the equator versus the poles.

00:27:39.480 --> 00:27:41.630
So, it's a plasma.

00:27:41.630 --> 00:27:45.850
Plasma are attracted to
electricity and magnetism.

00:27:45.850 --> 00:27:49.150
So, what happens is it means
that when this plasma moves,

00:27:49.150 --> 00:27:52.690
it drags magnetic fields with it.

00:27:52.690 --> 00:27:54.710
Okay. So, they're connected.

00:27:54.710 --> 00:27:56.800
They're coupled to each other.

00:27:56.800 --> 00:28:00.710
Now the sun, in its
simplest state is also

00:28:00.710 --> 00:28:02.480
like the earth, like
a giant bar magnet.

00:28:02.480 --> 00:28:06.790
So, it has magnetic fields
that go from north to south,

00:28:06.790 --> 00:28:08.280
south to north through it.

00:28:08.280 --> 00:28:10.600
And so, they're kind of this way.

00:28:10.600 --> 00:28:12.650
Now, watch this little animation.

00:28:12.650 --> 00:28:17.740
So, you see the magnetic fields
are going to start off up and down.

00:28:17.740 --> 00:28:20.980
But the equator's moving faster.

00:28:20.980 --> 00:28:23.920 position:56%
And plasma drags the magnetic field.

00:28:23.920 --> 00:28:26.870 position:56%
So, it drags the middle part faster.

00:28:26.870 --> 00:28:32.230
So, inside the sun, the magnetic
fields are getting all twisted up.

00:28:32.230 --> 00:28:34.660
So, this is, you're
actually looking inside.

00:28:34.660 --> 00:28:36.410 position:56%
So, you see how they get all knotted

00:28:36.410 --> 00:28:39.320
and they start popping
through the surface?

00:28:39.320 --> 00:28:41.290
That's the sunspots.

00:28:41.290 --> 00:28:43.500
That's where the sunspots are.

00:28:43.500 --> 00:28:46.680
The magnetic fields
are getting twisted up.

00:28:46.680 --> 00:28:50.330
They're rising up from
underneath, and they're popping

00:28:50.330 --> 00:28:54.440
through the visible surface,
and that's the sunspot.

00:28:54.440 --> 00:28:57.030
So, I'm going to show
you another animation

00:28:57.030 --> 00:29:00.340
from a different perspective to
show you what I'm talking about.

00:29:07.330 --> 00:29:10.950
See if this will go.

00:29:12.550 --> 00:29:14.930
Come on. Well it's
supposed to, there we go.

00:29:14.930 --> 00:29:16.480
Okay. So, there are the sunspots

00:29:16.480 --> 00:29:18.620
and the magnetic fields
coming through it.

00:29:18.620 --> 00:29:21.220
So, from underneath,
the magnetic fields

00:29:21.220 --> 00:29:23.970
that have gotten twisted start
popping through the surface.

00:29:23.970 --> 00:29:28.870
And where they pop
through, they suppress heat.

00:29:28.870 --> 00:29:30.830
So, that means that they look dark.

00:29:30.830 --> 00:29:32.420
They're not actually dark,

00:29:32.420 --> 00:29:35.200
but they're dark compared
to what's around them.

00:29:35.200 --> 00:29:39.800
And then eventually you
see that it gets so knotted

00:29:39.800 --> 00:29:43.410
that they flash their
releasing energy.

00:29:43.410 --> 00:29:47.100
That flash was the solar flare,
and then you saw this little blob

00:29:47.100 --> 00:29:51.570
of stuff coming off the top,
that's the coronal mass ejection.

00:29:51.570 --> 00:29:54.920
So, I'll let this run
through one more time.

00:29:57.370 --> 00:30:00.230
So, they're popping through.

00:30:00.230 --> 00:30:02.240
They're getting pushed together.

00:30:02.240 --> 00:30:07.640
And then all the sudden,
there goes a piece of it

00:30:07.640 --> 00:30:09.660
and solar material flying away.

00:30:09.660 --> 00:30:13.510
Okay, so that's an animation
of these complex eruptions.

00:30:13.510 --> 00:30:17.610 position:56%
So, here's sort of a static graphic.

00:30:17.610 --> 00:30:20.370
Now, for the moment ignore the
earth, of course this is not

00:30:20.370 --> 00:30:22.580
to scale, but ignore
the earth on the right.

00:30:22.580 --> 00:30:27.530
But what I want you to see is
again, these are the three parts.

00:30:27.530 --> 00:30:30.710
So, there's actually a flash here,

00:30:30.710 --> 00:30:33.100
there's a bright and
that's the flare.

00:30:33.100 --> 00:30:38.200
All of this stuff here is the
CME, the coronal mass ejection.

00:30:38.200 --> 00:30:41.860
But remember it's pushing
stuff in front of it.

00:30:41.860 --> 00:30:45.270
It's actually creating what's
called a shock, shock wave.

00:30:45.270 --> 00:30:48.620
Just like a sonic boom when
an aircraft travels faster

00:30:48.620 --> 00:30:51.960 position:56%
than the speed of sound, it actually
creates this shock in front of it,

00:30:51.960 --> 00:30:55.060
that actually makes
the noise the boom.

00:30:55.060 --> 00:30:56.360
There's a shock here.

00:30:56.360 --> 00:30:58.230 position:56%
So, here is the shock wave in front.

00:30:58.230 --> 00:31:01.240
And those are those
particles that I mentioned.

00:31:01.240 --> 00:31:05.060
And I'm going to show you what
those particles actually look

00:31:05.060 --> 00:31:06.460
like shortly.

00:31:06.460 --> 00:31:11.570
But those are again, the sort
of three parts of space weather.

00:31:11.570 --> 00:31:15.640
The flare, the release
of light, the stuff,

00:31:15.640 --> 00:31:18.190
the material and magnetic field.

00:31:18.190 --> 00:31:22.500
The coronal mass ejection, and then
all the things that plows ahead

00:31:22.500 --> 00:31:28.130
of it, the things that pushes ahead
of it, which are these particles.

00:31:28.130 --> 00:31:32.170
So, the sun is always
spinning stuff out.

00:31:32.170 --> 00:31:33.720
It has these big explosions,

00:31:33.720 --> 00:31:39.070
but also there is a constant
stream of solar particles.

00:31:39.070 --> 00:31:40.750
So, as I mentioned, as you move

00:31:40.750 --> 00:31:43.820
up in the solar atmosphere
it's getting hotter and hotter

00:31:43.820 --> 00:31:50.180
and it is literally boiling off,
it is escape, so much energy

00:31:50.180 --> 00:31:53.610
that material from the
sun escapes into space.

00:31:53.610 --> 00:31:58.080
And it is streaming away
from the sun all the time.

00:31:58.080 --> 00:31:59.820
And it fills the entire
solar system.

00:31:59.820 --> 00:32:02.480
It's called the solar wind.

00:32:02.480 --> 00:32:06.130
So, there's sort of this
background material that's always

00:32:06.130 --> 00:32:07.430
streaming away.

00:32:07.430 --> 00:32:10.850
And these big explosions are
like waves on top of the ocean.

00:32:10.850 --> 00:32:12.150
You know the ocean is sort

00:32:12.150 --> 00:32:14.940
of this background ocean
that's always there.

00:32:14.940 --> 00:32:17.450
And then you have these
huge explosions

00:32:17.450 --> 00:32:20.940
which are releasing additional
material on top of that.

00:32:20.940 --> 00:32:25.390
Kind of riding on top of this solar
wind that's always moving away

00:32:25.390 --> 00:32:26.690
from the sun.

00:32:26.690 --> 00:32:31.830
So, that solar wind is always
moving away, sort of ebb and flow.

00:32:31.830 --> 00:32:35.650
And we see that in our
entire solar system.

00:32:35.650 --> 00:32:38.500
In fact, all of that
material streams

00:32:38.500 --> 00:32:42.930
out way past the farthest
planets in the solar system

00:32:42.930 --> 00:32:48.830 position:56%
and creates this bubble around the
solar system called the heliosphere.

00:32:48.830 --> 00:32:52.110
It's kind of the realm
of influence of the sun.

00:32:52.110 --> 00:32:57.460
And here's a little animation
of what that looks like.

00:32:57.460 --> 00:33:01.590
So, you see the solar system is
actually kind of small in there.

00:33:01.590 --> 00:33:03.950
There's this big bubble.

00:33:03.950 --> 00:33:07.060
There are all these particles
streaming away from the sun.

00:33:07.060 --> 00:33:10.030
And as solar activity
goes up and down,

00:33:10.030 --> 00:33:12.240
that bubble expands and contracts.

00:33:12.240 --> 00:33:16.830
So, this, expansion and contraction
is on the order of years.

00:33:16.830 --> 00:33:19.930
It's moving out, coming back in.

00:33:19.930 --> 00:33:24.760
And the reason you see this sort
of elongated thing here so is

00:33:24.760 --> 00:33:28.790
because this whole structure,
the whole solar system,

00:33:28.790 --> 00:33:31.950
is traveling through the galaxy.

00:33:31.950 --> 00:33:34.810
And so, you can think of it like
a ship traveling through water

00:33:34.810 --> 00:33:38.010
and it leaves this wake around it.

00:33:38.010 --> 00:33:41.000
And as a matter of fact, we've
looked at other start systems

00:33:41.000 --> 00:33:44.350
with the Hubble Space Telescope
and we see this exact thing,

00:33:44.350 --> 00:33:46.660
we call those astrospheres.

00:33:46.660 --> 00:33:51.880
We see this kind of teardrop
structure that's the bubble

00:33:51.880 --> 00:33:56.510
of a star traveling
through the galaxy.

00:33:56.510 --> 00:34:00.310
That's why it's not just a perfect
circle you see this stuff coming

00:34:00.310 --> 00:34:01.610
out this way.

00:34:01.610 --> 00:34:05.070
We're going to see the
same effect with the earth.

00:34:05.070 --> 00:34:07.130
The earth actually
has the similar sort

00:34:07.130 --> 00:34:11.460
of structure called the
magnetosphere, as it's travelling

00:34:11.460 --> 00:34:12.760
through the solar system
and I'm going

00:34:12.760 --> 00:34:14.950
to show you what that looks like.

00:34:14.950 --> 00:34:22.330
But the key here is really
that space is not empty.

00:34:22.330 --> 00:34:26.600
We're living inside
of this environment

00:34:26.600 --> 00:34:31.190
that fills the whole solar
system, that's created by the sun.

00:34:31.190 --> 00:34:33.160
See there was an explosion there.

00:34:33.160 --> 00:34:36.220
Now, we're moving away.

00:34:36.220 --> 00:34:40.020
There's the solar wind, these
particles that are always there.

00:34:40.020 --> 00:34:43.040
But then there was an
explosion and there's going

00:34:43.040 --> 00:34:45.470
to be this blast of material.

00:34:45.470 --> 00:34:50.380
It's like driving into
a blinding rainstorm.

00:34:50.380 --> 00:34:54.020 position:56%
Now, these particles you're seeing
this visualization is actually based

00:34:54.020 --> 00:34:55.320
on real data.

00:34:55.320 --> 00:34:58.170
This is not an animation;
this is real data.

00:34:58.170 --> 00:35:01.510
So, there's the blob of stuff

00:35:01.510 --> 00:35:05.430
that is the coronal mass
ejection, traveling through space.

00:35:05.430 --> 00:35:08.680
Now, it's about to hit Venus.

00:35:08.680 --> 00:35:15.790
So, those particles, the CME,
coronal mass ejection also

00:35:15.790 --> 00:35:18.160
with magnetic field,
is hitting Venus.

00:35:18.160 --> 00:35:21.600
Now, notice it's sort of
hitting Venus directly on.

00:35:21.600 --> 00:35:23.930
And I'm going to go
back to that point.

00:35:23.930 --> 00:35:29.380
Now, we're getting to the earth.

00:35:29.380 --> 00:35:31.850
Now, notice the particles.

00:35:31.850 --> 00:35:34.850
They're kind of moving
around the earth.

00:35:34.850 --> 00:35:40.450
See, some of them are kind of
deflected here, above and below.

00:35:40.450 --> 00:35:43.790
And the reason is because the
earth has a magnetic field.

00:35:43.790 --> 00:35:45.740
Venus does not have
a magnetic field.

00:35:45.740 --> 00:35:48.440
And that's why the particles
were hitting Venus directly.

00:35:48.440 --> 00:35:50.360
Because these particles, this stuff

00:35:50.360 --> 00:35:53.150
from the sun is electromagnetic
in nature.

00:35:53.150 --> 00:35:56.300
It response to electricity
and magnetism.

00:35:56.300 --> 00:36:04.470
So, the earth's magnetic
field is deflecting that.

00:36:04.470 --> 00:36:08.250
And actually, I don't, there's a
cool animation and I don't want

00:36:08.250 --> 00:36:11.360
to go into it, but I was
supposed to cut that off.

00:36:11.360 --> 00:36:13.060
But, what I wanted to just point

00:36:13.060 --> 00:36:17.900
out is the earth has a magnetic
field, just like the sun does.

00:36:17.900 --> 00:36:19.200
It's kind of a bar magnet.

00:36:19.200 --> 00:36:20.570
It's a little more complicated.

00:36:20.570 --> 00:36:23.370
So, all of this stuff coming
off the sun is interacting

00:36:23.370 --> 00:36:25.120
with the earth's magnetic field.

00:36:25.120 --> 00:36:26.790
In this case, deflected by it.

00:36:26.790 --> 00:36:29.050
And it actually creates
this similar kind

00:36:29.050 --> 00:36:33.330
of tear-dropped stretched bubble
structure that I was talking to you

00:36:33.330 --> 00:36:34.660
about for the heliosphere.

00:36:34.660 --> 00:36:37.790
And we call that the magnetosphere.

00:36:37.790 --> 00:36:41.270
And so, what happens when
all that stuff interacts

00:36:41.270 --> 00:36:43.830
with the earth's magnetic field?

00:36:43.830 --> 00:36:46.830
You get this.

00:36:46.830 --> 00:36:49.650
You get all of this stuff.

00:36:49.650 --> 00:36:51.950
This is the Aurora.

00:36:53.150 --> 00:36:56.030
Sometimes called the
Northern or Southern Lights.

00:36:56.030 --> 00:36:58.910
In this case, we're actually
looking at the Southern Lights

00:36:58.910 --> 00:37:01.860
because this is the International
Space Station traveling

00:37:01.860 --> 00:37:04.160
over the Indian Ocean.

00:37:07.090 --> 00:37:09.460
But you see all of that
crazy dynamic structure.

00:37:09.460 --> 00:37:12.510
That's because there are
particles interacting

00:37:12.510 --> 00:37:14.630
with the earth's magnetic field.

00:37:14.630 --> 00:37:17.580 position:56%
In fact, those particles are
hitting the atmosphere of the earth.

00:37:17.580 --> 00:37:20.880 position:56%
They're hitting oxygen and nitrogen.

00:37:20.880 --> 00:37:28.510
And they're exciting those
elements and causing them to glow

00:37:28.510 --> 00:37:31.620
in greens, blues, sometimes red.

00:37:31.620 --> 00:37:33.600
So, it depends on which element.

00:37:33.600 --> 00:37:38.720
It also depends on
how high up they are.

00:37:38.720 --> 00:37:40.460
So, what's really happening there?

00:37:40.460 --> 00:37:41.760
Okay what's happening?

00:37:41.760 --> 00:37:45.040
So, I mentioned that the
earth has a magnetic field.

00:37:45.040 --> 00:37:46.560
It's kind of like a bar magnet,

00:37:46.560 --> 00:37:48.520
but it's a little more
complicated than that.

00:37:48.520 --> 00:37:51.600
But remember, all this
stuff is coming off the sun.

00:37:51.600 --> 00:37:52.930
It's interacting with
the magnetic field

00:37:52.930 --> 00:37:57.250
and it stretches the
earth's magnetic field

00:37:57.250 --> 00:38:04.450
from this kind spherical structure
into this long elongated thing.

00:38:04.450 --> 00:38:08.480
So, I'm going to show you
another computer visualization.

00:38:08.480 --> 00:38:10.050
This is real data connected

00:38:10.050 --> 00:38:16.210
with a computer model showing
the magnetic field of the earth.

00:38:16.210 --> 00:38:17.510
To show you what's happening.

00:38:17.510 --> 00:38:18.810
So, we're looking from the side.

00:38:18.810 --> 00:38:24.650
So, you see in this case, the sun
is actually over here to the left.

00:38:24.650 --> 00:38:29.200 position:56%
So, there's stuff traveling,
hitting, you see that it starts off,

00:38:29.200 --> 00:38:32.100
it's almost kind of a
little bit more symmetric.

00:38:32.100 --> 00:38:34.740
But it's dragging it
all out this way.

00:38:34.740 --> 00:38:39.720
But when you see that blast that's
hitting and pulling everything,

00:38:39.720 --> 00:38:41.480
that's the coronal mass ejection.

00:38:41.480 --> 00:38:46.000
That's the CME that billions
of tons of material slamming

00:38:46.000 --> 00:38:49.180
into the earth's magnetosphere.

00:38:49.180 --> 00:38:54.130
Now, this case we're actually
looking at data that was taken

00:38:54.130 --> 00:38:59.210
from an event that went off to the
side of the sun, because it was one

00:38:59.210 --> 00:39:02.440
of the largest events we'd ever
seen and we're projecting it

00:39:02.440 --> 00:39:04.530
onto the earth to see
what would actually happen

00:39:04.530 --> 00:39:06.530
if that event hit the earth.

00:39:06.530 --> 00:39:11.470
So, this is an event that didn't in
fact hit the earth, but if it had,

00:39:11.470 --> 00:39:14.250
we wanted to see what would happen.

00:39:14.250 --> 00:39:23.250 position:56%
So, notice here, right about here is
where satellites in lower orbit sit.

00:39:23.250 --> 00:39:28.300 position:56%
And you see they sit inside the
magnetic field until that thing hits

00:39:28.300 --> 00:39:32.690
and pushes it all and all
the sudden, spacecraft,

00:39:32.690 --> 00:39:37.050
which were sitting inside the
magnetic field are now outside the

00:39:37.050 --> 00:39:38.350
magnetic field.

00:39:38.350 --> 00:39:41.960
Because all this stuff
coming off the sun pushes it

00:39:41.960 --> 00:39:45.580
and is pushing the atmosphere
and the magnetic structure

00:39:45.580 --> 00:39:49.120
of the earth, away from the sun.

00:39:49.120 --> 00:39:52.450
So, this is a very extreme event.

00:39:52.450 --> 00:40:01.550
So, let me show you a real
example of space weather, okay?

00:40:01.550 --> 00:40:06.050
March 7, 2012.

00:40:06.050 --> 00:40:07.600
Keep an eye right there.

00:40:07.600 --> 00:40:13.380 position:56%
There was a flare, here it is again.

00:40:13.380 --> 00:40:15.020
There's actually two flares.

00:40:15.020 --> 00:40:17.700
One, and two.

00:40:17.700 --> 00:40:19.770
You see all that stuff moving?

00:40:19.770 --> 00:40:22.750
That's material being blasted away.

00:40:22.750 --> 00:40:27.040
You can see the magnetic
fields are actually wiggling.

00:40:27.040 --> 00:40:30.190
Those loops are actually wiggling.

00:40:30.190 --> 00:40:35.770 position:56%
So, that is, the flare is that flash
of light and it is throwing away,

00:40:35.770 --> 00:40:40.200
it's spitting, the sun is spitting
out billions of tons of material.

00:40:40.200 --> 00:40:43.370
Now, it's very difficult to
see that from this perspective,

00:40:43.370 --> 00:40:45.460
to see that material
leaving the sun.

00:40:45.460 --> 00:40:46.760
So, what do we do?

00:40:46.760 --> 00:40:51.430
We actually create an
artificial eclipse.

00:40:51.430 --> 00:40:55.210
So, we take a telescope that
looks at the sun in white light,

00:40:55.210 --> 00:41:00.900
in visible light, and we put a disk
in front of the telescope to block

00:41:00.900 --> 00:41:03.530
out the bright disk of the sun.

00:41:03.530 --> 00:41:05.800
Because what's happening
during an eclipse?

00:41:05.800 --> 00:41:09.100
The disk of the sun is
a million times brighter

00:41:09.100 --> 00:41:12.180
than that wispy structure you
saw during a total solar eclipse.

00:41:12.180 --> 00:41:16.040
So, when the moon blocks the disk
of the sun out, it's allowing us

00:41:16.040 --> 00:41:19.590
to see things that are a million
times fainter than the surface.

00:41:19.590 --> 00:41:21.590
It's just like looking
at a bright light.

00:41:21.590 --> 00:41:23.340
If there's a little dim light
next to it, you're not going

00:41:23.340 --> 00:41:25.830
to see it unless you put
your hand up in front

00:41:25.830 --> 00:41:27.710
and sort of block it out.

00:41:27.710 --> 00:41:30.800
So, we're going to do that.

00:41:30.800 --> 00:41:36.140
Now, the sun is actually
in this little circle here.

00:41:36.140 --> 00:41:39.060
The reason being, we
can't an eclipse as good

00:41:39.060 --> 00:41:42.770
as the moon and the sun system can.

00:41:42.770 --> 00:41:45.880
So, we can't get the
eclipse to block all the way

00:41:45.880 --> 00:41:47.440
down to the surface of the sun.

00:41:47.440 --> 00:41:50.080
So, that's why this
disk blocking the sun

00:41:50.080 --> 00:41:54.090
out is exactly much
bigger than the sun.

00:41:54.090 --> 00:41:58.780
But, you'll see there's a
wispy structure that came.

00:41:58.780 --> 00:42:01.380
There's this kind of
smoke ring like thing.

00:42:01.380 --> 00:42:06.130
That's the coronal mass
ejection, or the CME,

00:42:06.130 --> 00:42:09.720
but then remember that's pushing
all this stuff in front of it.

00:42:09.720 --> 00:42:14.060
Particles; super, super high-energy
particles traveling close

00:42:14.060 --> 00:42:15.380
to the speed of light.

00:42:15.380 --> 00:42:20.350
Well you see all the snow, that's
the particles hitting the camera.

00:42:20.350 --> 00:42:21.750
Hitting the CCD.

00:42:21.750 --> 00:42:25.600
This camera has a CCD which
is almost identical to what's

00:42:25.600 --> 00:42:28.830
in your cellphone, or
your digital camera.

00:42:28.830 --> 00:42:31.270
And when those high-energy
particles travel

00:42:31.270 --> 00:42:35.160
through that CCD they
leave these little tracks

00:42:35.160 --> 00:42:37.870
because they're depositing energy.

00:42:37.870 --> 00:42:40.000
And so, that's the
snow you're seeing.

00:42:40.000 --> 00:42:42.680
So, this is actually
a really big event.

00:42:42.680 --> 00:42:43.980
That's a lot of snow.

00:42:43.980 --> 00:42:47.180
That's a very, very
huge particle event.

00:42:47.180 --> 00:42:49.370
Now, why do we care about that?

00:42:49.370 --> 00:42:54.120
If you're an astronaut in
space, those particles,

00:42:54.120 --> 00:42:57.970
that's a blast of radiation.

00:42:57.970 --> 00:43:00.770
When you're on earth, we
are very well protected

00:43:00.770 --> 00:43:03.350
by not just the magnetic
field of the earth,

00:43:03.350 --> 00:43:06.110
but actually more importantly,
the atmosphere.

00:43:06.110 --> 00:43:08.070
We live in a very thick atmosphere.

00:43:08.070 --> 00:43:10.320
It doesn't feel very
thick, but there's a lot

00:43:10.320 --> 00:43:13.820
of atmosphere between us and space.

00:43:13.820 --> 00:43:17.240 position:56%
And it stops all of those particles.

00:43:17.240 --> 00:43:20.490
Unless you're on top of a mountain,
or traveling in an airplane,

00:43:20.490 --> 00:43:23.270
you can't really measure much
of these types of particles.

00:43:23.270 --> 00:43:25.220
They don't make it to the ground.

00:43:25.220 --> 00:43:30.060
But if you're an astronaut
and if you're out in the ISS

00:43:30.060 --> 00:43:35.180
or even traveling to the moon,
then you're no longer protected.

00:43:35.180 --> 00:43:38.720
And even worse if you're
traveling to Mars.

00:43:38.720 --> 00:43:41.660 position:56%
The moon is even sometimes protected
by the magnetic field of the earth.

00:43:41.660 --> 00:43:43.590
Because sometimes the
moon actually orbits

00:43:43.590 --> 00:43:45.800
in the magnetic field of the earth.

00:43:45.800 --> 00:43:49.920
So, it just so happens that in 1972

00:43:49.920 --> 00:43:57.110
between the last two Apollo
missions, there was a solar storm

00:43:57.110 --> 00:44:00.750
that produced the largest particle
event, particle storm like this,

00:44:00.750 --> 00:44:03.200
all this snow that
we've ever recorded.

00:44:03.200 --> 00:44:06.120
So, if either of those
Apollo missions had,

00:44:06.120 --> 00:44:09.680
if the second to last one
had gone a little bit later,

00:44:09.680 --> 00:44:12.180
or the last one had gone
a little bit earlier,

00:44:12.180 --> 00:44:15.910 position:56%
on a scale of about a month,
astronauts would have been traveling

00:44:15.910 --> 00:44:21.230
to the moon and a storm 10 times or
more than this would have hit them.

00:44:21.230 --> 00:44:26.190
And they probably would've gotten
a lethal dose of radiation.

00:44:26.190 --> 00:44:29.520
Because they're not
particularly protected

00:44:29.520 --> 00:44:33.560
in literally the tin can they
were flying in to the moon.

00:44:33.560 --> 00:44:36.190 position:56%
So, that's a really critical aspect.

00:44:36.190 --> 00:44:39.450
And that is one of the biggest
challenges of traveling to,

00:44:39.450 --> 00:44:41.520
especially to some place like Mars.

00:44:41.520 --> 00:44:45.860
Now, when you go to Mars, Mars
doesn't have the magnetic field,

00:44:45.860 --> 00:44:49.500
but it also has an
extremely thin atmosphere.

00:44:49.500 --> 00:44:54.210 position:56%
To put that in perspective, the
atmosphere of Mars is about as thick

00:44:54.210 --> 00:44:57.600
as our atmosphere at 100,000 feet.

00:44:57.600 --> 00:45:02.650
Higher than any of the
commercial airplanes flying.

00:45:02.650 --> 00:45:05.110
You know you've see
the movie "The Martian"

00:45:05.110 --> 00:45:06.410
which is actually pretty good.

00:45:06.410 --> 00:45:09.100
There's a lot that's
really quite accurate in it.

00:45:09.100 --> 00:45:12.460
But one thing that's not
accurate in it is the storm.

00:45:12.460 --> 00:45:18.550
You could barely blow
a tissue over with Mars

00:45:18.550 --> 00:45:20.070
because the atmosphere is so thin.

00:45:20.070 --> 00:45:21.980
There's just, there's
no pressure there,

00:45:21.980 --> 00:45:24.760
much less a spaceship or a rocket.

00:45:24.760 --> 00:45:28.150 position:56%
But, because there is no atmosphere,

00:45:28.150 --> 00:45:33.250
that means you're almost
unprotected from these particles.

00:45:33.250 --> 00:45:34.550
So, that would mean you need

00:45:34.550 --> 00:45:38.510
to build your enclosure
either underground,

00:45:38.510 --> 00:45:40.280
or you have to have materials

00:45:40.280 --> 00:45:42.850
that are thick enough
to protect you from it.

00:45:42.850 --> 00:45:47.290
So, this is one of the biggest
challenges of traveling in space.

00:45:47.290 --> 00:45:49.520
The environment is quite harsh

00:45:49.520 --> 00:45:53.740
and the biggest issue
are these particles.

00:45:53.740 --> 00:45:56.570
I'm going to talk a little bit more
about some of the other types of

00:45:56.570 --> 00:45:58.200
and aspect of space weather,

00:45:58.200 --> 00:46:01.230
in particular how it
impacts our technology.

00:46:01.230 --> 00:46:05.770
But in terms of flying
through the solar system,

00:46:05.770 --> 00:46:09.600 position:56%
these particle events are really the
most critical part of space weather

00:46:09.600 --> 00:46:11.260
that we have to pay attention to.

00:46:11.260 --> 00:46:12.720
And this is the biggest challenge

00:46:12.720 --> 00:46:17.890
that we have going
to a place like Mars.

00:46:17.890 --> 00:46:22.660
And for the moon also, it's
still a huge challenge.

00:46:22.660 --> 00:46:24.200
But especially Mars.

00:46:24.200 --> 00:46:26.700
Because really it's
the long-term exposure

00:46:26.700 --> 00:46:28.230
to radiation that is an issue.

00:46:28.230 --> 00:46:31.100
Now one of the things,
I'm not going to go into,

00:46:31.100 --> 00:46:33.900
but there is another aspect to it.

00:46:33.900 --> 00:46:37.730
We are also, our solar system
is filled with particles

00:46:37.730 --> 00:46:41.290
from outside the solar
system called cosmic rays.

00:46:41.290 --> 00:46:43.480
So, huge explosions that happen

00:46:43.480 --> 00:46:47.390
around the galaxy called
supernova; stars exploding.

00:46:47.390 --> 00:46:50.620
They treated particles even
more energetic than this.

00:46:50.620 --> 00:46:53.390
They're incredibly
powerful explosions.

00:46:53.390 --> 00:46:57.900 position:56%
And so, those particles are
everywhere and they actually make it

00:46:57.900 --> 00:47:01.380
into the solar system through
the magnetic field of the sun.

00:47:01.380 --> 00:47:04.690
But they are somewhat
deflected by that.

00:47:04.690 --> 00:47:07.040
So, when the sun is really active,

00:47:07.040 --> 00:47:10.060
these cosmic rays are
actually less of them.

00:47:10.060 --> 00:47:11.610
The sun actually pushes so when

00:47:11.610 --> 00:47:15.250
that heliosphere I
showed you pushes outward,

00:47:15.250 --> 00:47:20.030 position:56%
it actually pushes these cosmic rays
out and away from the solar system.

00:47:20.030 --> 00:47:22.380
And as the sun gets quieter,

00:47:22.380 --> 00:47:26.020
and that heliosphere shrinks,
more cosmic rays get in.

00:47:26.020 --> 00:47:30.970
So, when solar activity is
low, cosmic rays are high.

00:47:30.970 --> 00:47:35.430
And we actually see, if you look
at the sunspots, and cosmic rays,

00:47:35.430 --> 00:47:38.590 position:56%
they're exactly opposite each other.

00:47:38.590 --> 00:47:41.340
So, that's the other challenge.

00:47:41.340 --> 00:47:43.630
That I'm not going to talk
about in any detail here,

00:47:43.630 --> 00:47:45.960
but that's the other
part of traveling.

00:47:45.960 --> 00:47:48.040
It actually may turn
out, strangely enough

00:47:48.040 --> 00:47:52.110
that traveling during high
solar activity may be better

00:47:52.110 --> 00:47:53.410
in the long run.

00:47:53.410 --> 00:47:56.840
Because it's really the long-term
exposure that's the issue.

00:47:56.840 --> 00:47:58.520
But, these are still a problem.

00:47:58.520 --> 00:48:02.000
The other part of this, you see
all those particles are hitting the

00:48:02.000 --> 00:48:06.790
telescope and leaving
all this snow in there.

00:48:06.790 --> 00:48:10.780
Well, those particles also do the
same kind of thing to electronics.

00:48:10.780 --> 00:48:12.970
They're traveling through memory.

00:48:12.970 --> 00:48:17.340
So, one of the biggest issues is
when one of those particles travels

00:48:17.340 --> 00:48:20.300
through a piece of
memory, solid-state memory.

00:48:20.300 --> 00:48:25.270
So, remember we work in what's
called binary; zeros and ones.

00:48:25.270 --> 00:48:29.680 position:56%
All of our computers are using
zeros and ones to carry information.

00:48:29.680 --> 00:48:33.030
And if one of those
particles travels through,

00:48:33.030 --> 00:48:36.280
if it has enough energy,
it can actually flip.

00:48:36.280 --> 00:48:40.210
Turn a zero into a one,
or a one into a zero.

00:48:40.210 --> 00:48:43.770
You've got a whole bunch of
those, they make up an instruction

00:48:43.770 --> 00:48:47.060
that tells the telescope,
take a picture.

00:48:47.060 --> 00:48:49.430
Stay on. Turn off.

00:48:49.430 --> 00:48:52.330
Or tells the spacecraft,
keep going forward.

00:48:52.330 --> 00:48:53.720
Go to the left, go to the right.

00:48:53.720 --> 00:48:57.610
There are all these commands
inside the computer that are made

00:48:57.610 --> 00:48:59.310
up of these zeros and ones.

00:48:59.310 --> 00:49:03.660
You've got this command and all of
the sudden a zero changes to a one.

00:49:03.660 --> 00:49:08.840 position:56%
The spacecraft has all the sudden
been told, oh turn off your engines.

00:49:08.840 --> 00:49:11.840
You know, shut off life
support, or something like that.

00:49:11.840 --> 00:49:14.410
I mean. So fortunately,
it's not quite,

00:49:14.410 --> 00:49:15.710
it's a little more
complicated that than.

00:49:15.710 --> 00:49:17.050
But that is a problem.

00:49:17.050 --> 00:49:20.060
So, this is the other
challenge when we go

00:49:20.060 --> 00:49:23.850
out into this harsh environment,
is that we have to deal with this.

00:49:23.850 --> 00:49:25.740
And so, we have to do
all kinds of things,

00:49:25.740 --> 00:49:28.330
like use software to
make corrections.

00:49:28.330 --> 00:49:31.440 position:56%
But when there's a really big storm,
one of the things we have to do

00:49:31.440 --> 00:49:33.880
for our spacecraft, is we
actually turn them off.

00:49:33.880 --> 00:49:36.300
We basically put them
in a safe mode.

00:49:36.300 --> 00:49:38.490
It's sort of like, there's
a thunderstorm coming,

00:49:38.490 --> 00:49:42.200
there's lightening, so you unplug
your stereo, or your TV so that

00:49:42.200 --> 00:49:45.290
if lightening hits it
doesn't kind of overload it.

00:49:45.290 --> 00:49:47.770
We sort of do something
similar to that.

00:49:47.770 --> 00:49:49.830
Basically, we put them
in a safe mode

00:49:49.830 --> 00:49:52.730
so that these things
don't have an impact.

00:49:52.730 --> 00:49:56.700 position:56%
Here's another example, this is just
another corona graph showing you

00:49:56.700 --> 00:49:59.000
slightly different perspective.

00:50:00.340 --> 00:50:04.340
Actually, there's a slight, you'll
see the sun actually disappear.

00:50:04.340 --> 00:50:07.970
So, I've actually overlaid
an image of the sun

00:50:07.970 --> 00:50:10.030
on top of the chronograph.

00:50:10.030 --> 00:50:12.740
There actually is an
eclipse of the moon.

00:50:12.740 --> 00:50:15.420
And you can see if you look
at it closely you see the disk

00:50:15.420 --> 00:50:18.780
in the center all the sudden
gets black for a second.

00:50:18.780 --> 00:50:21.030
If you blink, you'll miss it.

00:50:21.030 --> 00:50:25.670
And this is one of the
impacts of that storm.

00:50:25.670 --> 00:50:27.680
We had an amazing Aurora, all

00:50:27.680 --> 00:50:33.480
over the northern US,
Michigan, Scandinavia.

00:50:33.480 --> 00:50:36.590
So, this incredible Aurora.

00:50:36.590 --> 00:50:39.340
But I'm going to show you
really quickly what are some

00:50:39.340 --> 00:50:41.690
of the thing we have to think
about for space weather.

00:50:41.690 --> 00:50:45.670
So, remember that all of
this stuff is happening,

00:50:45.670 --> 00:50:47.660
because again it's electromagnetic.

00:50:47.660 --> 00:50:50.810
All of that material is
plasma, which response

00:50:50.810 --> 00:50:52.960
to electricity and magnetism.

00:50:52.960 --> 00:50:55.560
And it's carrying magnetic
fields with it.

00:50:55.560 --> 00:50:59.570
So, all of the phenomena
that we're talking

00:50:59.570 --> 00:51:02.410
about is electromagnetic in nature.

00:51:02.410 --> 00:51:04.530
And so, what does that mean?

00:51:04.530 --> 00:51:08.820
That means that it
impacts technology.

00:51:08.820 --> 00:51:10.550
So, a couple of things happen.

00:51:10.550 --> 00:51:13.650
So, I mentioned those particles.

00:51:13.650 --> 00:51:18.740
The flare and the CME create those
high-energy particles you saw

00:51:18.740 --> 00:51:20.040
on the camera.

00:51:20.040 --> 00:51:24.410
Those impact spacecraft,
they can damage electronics.

00:51:24.410 --> 00:51:26.460
There should be an astronaut
floating around up here

00:51:26.460 --> 00:51:28.650
who would also be in danger.

00:51:28.650 --> 00:51:35.240
The other thing is that when you
saw that model of the magnetosphere

00:51:35.240 --> 00:51:38.670
and this big blast hit it, and
it starts wiggling like this

00:51:38.670 --> 00:51:40.100
and everything starts moving.

00:51:40.100 --> 00:51:43.000
Magnetic fields when
they move quickly,

00:51:43.000 --> 00:51:44.700
they create electrical currents.

00:51:44.700 --> 00:51:49.790
That's the physics behind
generators and motors.

00:51:49.790 --> 00:51:55.060
You're moving a magnetic field very
quickly it generates electricity.

00:51:55.060 --> 00:51:59.020
Well, that happens in the
outer atmosphere of the earth.

00:51:59.020 --> 00:52:01.420
So, there are currents
that are generated up here.

00:52:01.420 --> 00:52:04.490
Now, those currents
also give us the Aurora.

00:52:04.490 --> 00:52:07.720
They help to create, and
accelerate the particles

00:52:07.720 --> 00:52:09.020
and give us the Aurora.

00:52:09.020 --> 00:52:13.260
But, it impacts communications.

00:52:13.260 --> 00:52:14.790
It's disrupts GPS.

00:52:14.790 --> 00:52:19.040
It doesn't necessarily stop GPS,
but it makes it less accurate.

00:52:19.040 --> 00:52:24.310
So, if your GPS is telling
you something is right here,

00:52:24.310 --> 00:52:27.110 position:56%
the accuracy could be 10 times worse

00:52:27.110 --> 00:52:30.210
and it could actually be
you know a couple of meters,

00:52:30.210 --> 00:52:33.020 position:56%
or even a couple of kilometers away.

00:52:33.020 --> 00:52:40.110
That may not be as big a deal for
us, but these days we have farming

00:52:40.110 --> 00:52:44.160
that uses automated tractors
that are running on GPS.

00:52:44.160 --> 00:52:46.410
We even have, this is crazy.

00:52:46.410 --> 00:52:48.830
I talked to a friend of
mine who drives trucks.

00:52:48.830 --> 00:52:53.060
We even have people who drive
trucks around dangerous mountains

00:52:53.060 --> 00:52:56.740
in bad weather using GPS.

00:52:56.740 --> 00:53:01.810
But we drill in the ocean
for oil, or things like that.

00:53:01.810 --> 00:53:06.660
Doing even complicated construction
we use GPS for where things are.

00:53:06.660 --> 00:53:09.150
So, that's a huge issue.

00:53:09.150 --> 00:53:12.300
It impacts communications
on airplanes.

00:53:12.300 --> 00:53:18.270 position:56%
One of the issues is airplanes can't
be out of contact for less than,

00:53:18.270 --> 00:53:20.020
somewhere on the scale of minutes,

00:53:20.020 --> 00:53:26.110
when it's talking to
various airports.

00:53:26.110 --> 00:53:29.620
These storms, these occurrence,

00:53:29.620 --> 00:53:31.780
they're generated closer
to the poles.

00:53:31.780 --> 00:53:35.100
So, the magnetic fields
go from pole to pole.

00:53:35.100 --> 00:53:37.560
So, they go like this in this loop.

00:53:37.560 --> 00:53:41.070
When they come into the
North Pole or the South Pole,

00:53:41.070 --> 00:53:42.990
that's where the magnetic
field is weakest.

00:53:42.990 --> 00:53:45.040
And that's where the
storms are the strongest.

00:53:45.040 --> 00:53:49.210
That's why we see Aurora mostly
near the North and South Pole.

00:53:49.210 --> 00:53:53.630
As a storm becomes stronger, we
see these Aurora move farther

00:53:53.630 --> 00:53:55.720
and farther, closer to the equator.

00:53:55.720 --> 00:53:58.340
The storms are actually
moving down the equator.

00:53:58.340 --> 00:53:59.680
That's what's happening.

00:53:59.680 --> 00:54:02.360
But if you're in an airplane
and you're traveling from DC

00:54:02.360 --> 00:54:06.000
to Hong Kong you want to
travel over the poles.

00:54:06.000 --> 00:54:10.110
That's the shortest distance,
but you can travel over the poles

00:54:10.110 --> 00:54:13.840
if the communications are
out because of a solar storm.

00:54:13.840 --> 00:54:17.230
So, they have to travel
around instead,

00:54:17.230 --> 00:54:20.250
which means that they spend
a lot more fuel and a lot

00:54:20.250 --> 00:54:22.310
of money, and a lot more time.

00:54:22.310 --> 00:54:24.820
So, that's an issue for them.

00:54:24.820 --> 00:54:30.410
Also, if you're traveling as a
pilot or an airline attendant

00:54:30.410 --> 00:54:34.590
for long periods of time
over, you know many years,

00:54:34.590 --> 00:54:36.270
you are exposed to more radiation.

00:54:36.270 --> 00:54:38.220
Because you're higher up.

00:54:38.220 --> 00:54:40.270
So, that's an issue too.

00:54:40.270 --> 00:54:42.180
They don't want people
to be traveling

00:54:42.180 --> 00:54:44.870
through the poles during a storm.

00:54:44.870 --> 00:54:48.060
One of those particle storms.

00:54:48.060 --> 00:54:52.550
And then one of the other issues
is these currents are generated

00:54:52.550 --> 00:54:54.160
up in the atmosphere.

00:54:54.160 --> 00:54:57.420
They're also generated
down on the ground.

00:54:57.420 --> 00:55:02.390
Because when currents run
near a transmission line,

00:55:02.390 --> 00:55:04.360
okay near a conductor.

00:55:04.360 --> 00:55:08.780
In this case, let's say
between two electrical poles

00:55:08.780 --> 00:55:10.400
that are a kilometer apart.

00:55:10.400 --> 00:55:12.070
That's a long transmission line.

00:55:12.070 --> 00:55:14.040
That actually picks
up those currents

00:55:14.040 --> 00:55:16.030
and currents are generated in that.

00:55:16.030 --> 00:55:18.790 position:56%
If those currents are strong enough,

00:55:18.790 --> 00:55:20.640
and this is actually
much more analogous

00:55:20.640 --> 00:55:23.210
to the storm hitting your house.

00:55:23.210 --> 00:55:26.070
Those currents can
overload transformers,

00:55:26.070 --> 00:55:27.770
and they can take out power grids.

00:55:27.770 --> 00:55:29.350
And we've seen this happen,

00:55:29.350 --> 00:55:35.350
1989 we had the entire
Quebec power grid went out.

00:55:35.350 --> 00:55:39.740
And there have been other
storms that have hit.

00:55:39.740 --> 00:55:49.880
Generally, mostly communities in
places like a Sweden or Norway

00:55:49.880 --> 00:55:51.580
or something like that because
they're close to the poles.

00:55:51.580 --> 00:55:52.990
But, if they're strong enough,

00:55:52.990 --> 00:55:55.930
they can reach farther south,
and they can impact us.

00:55:55.930 --> 00:55:59.090
So, that's another area that
we have to be concerned on.

00:55:59.090 --> 00:56:03.730
Now, one thing to think about is
that the good thing is that all

00:56:03.730 --> 00:56:06.060
of these industries
are well aware of this.

00:56:06.060 --> 00:56:09.060
So, they pay close attention
to the weather report

00:56:09.060 --> 00:56:11.240
when it comes to space weather.

00:56:11.240 --> 00:56:13.700
And they take certain actions.

00:56:13.700 --> 00:56:15.610
As I said, they reroute planes,

00:56:15.610 --> 00:56:19.110
or they may change transformer
settings and things like that.

00:56:19.110 --> 00:56:22.370
So, it's something that they
do pay close attention to.

00:56:22.370 --> 00:56:26.320 position:56%
Now, I'm going to quickly go through
a few things just to show you.

00:56:26.320 --> 00:56:28.320
So, what do we do to keep an eye

00:56:28.320 --> 00:56:31.460
on the space weather,
how do we do this?

00:56:31.460 --> 00:56:32.760
How do we keep an eye on that?

00:56:32.760 --> 00:56:37.160
Well, it turns out we have
a huge fleet of spacecraft.

00:56:37.160 --> 00:56:41.040
We have 18 missions
just in heliophysics,

00:56:41.040 --> 00:56:43.260 position:56%
the study of the sun and its impact.

00:56:43.260 --> 00:56:46.150
Just in heliophysics we have
18 missions that study all

00:56:46.150 --> 00:56:50.770
of these different aspects of what
comes off the sun, what's traveling

00:56:50.770 --> 00:56:53.870
through space, and
what reaches earth.

00:56:53.870 --> 00:56:56.430
But as I mentioned for
NASA, we're also interested

00:56:56.430 --> 00:56:58.910
in all the other planets.

00:56:58.910 --> 00:57:01.830
So, we put instruments
on even things like Juno,

00:57:01.830 --> 00:57:04.230
which has just reached
Jupiter, or New Horizon,

00:57:04.230 --> 00:57:07.710
which recently, last
year passed Pluto.

00:57:07.710 --> 00:57:11.140
All of them measure space weather
phenomenon as they're traveling

00:57:11.140 --> 00:57:12.820
through the solar system.

00:57:12.820 --> 00:57:17.790
Now, this is just the spacecraft
that are around the earth.

00:57:17.790 --> 00:57:21.540
This elongated structure
is the magnetosphere.

00:57:21.540 --> 00:57:23.780 position:56%
So, again, the sun is now over here.

00:57:23.780 --> 00:57:26.510
And it's pulling this
big long structure back.

00:57:26.510 --> 00:57:28.980
But these are all of the
different spacecraft that we have

00:57:28.980 --> 00:57:30.280
that are looking at that.

00:57:30.280 --> 00:57:35.740
When we have all that
data, we actually make; so,

00:57:35.740 --> 00:57:39.320
here's just an example, there's
a big storm that we measured.

00:57:39.320 --> 00:57:40.910
This actually went off
the side of the sun

00:57:40.910 --> 00:57:43.560
because we have spacecraft
around the sun.

00:57:43.560 --> 00:57:46.970
We have spacecraft on the
backside of the sun and we're able

00:57:46.970 --> 00:57:49.180
to see things that happen
everywhere on the sun,

00:57:49.180 --> 00:57:50.790
not just stuff that goes to earth.

00:57:50.790 --> 00:57:53.140
So, you can see, this
was a really big event.

00:57:53.140 --> 00:57:55.430
See how much snow there was there.

00:57:55.430 --> 00:58:02.000
This was the biggest event ever
recorded with modern spacecraft.

00:58:02.000 --> 00:58:08.870
And so, we actually put that into
a computer model with real physics.

00:58:08.870 --> 00:58:11.540
And just like we have
a hurricane tracking,

00:58:11.540 --> 00:58:15.790
just like we track hurricanes to
figure out where are they going to,

00:58:15.790 --> 00:58:18.450
you know how far are they going
to be, where are they going

00:58:18.450 --> 00:58:21.590
to make landfall, when are
they going to make landfall.

00:58:21.590 --> 00:58:25.150
We do the same thing
with solar storms.

00:58:25.150 --> 00:58:27.160
So, there's one, there's the earth.

00:58:27.160 --> 00:58:29.340
There's the sun.

00:58:29.340 --> 00:58:31.650
Now, wait for it.

00:58:31.650 --> 00:58:34.580
There's the one you just saw.

00:58:34.580 --> 00:58:36.030
It travelled off this way.

00:58:36.030 --> 00:58:37.330
So, there's a couple
of smaller ones.

00:58:37.330 --> 00:58:38.690
There's Mars.

00:58:38.690 --> 00:58:41.680
That was the spacecraft
stereo, there's a stereo here

00:58:41.680 --> 00:58:45.300
and a stereo here that are
actually seeing the sun,

00:58:45.300 --> 00:58:46.850
not just from head on.

00:58:46.850 --> 00:58:51.230
So, just to let you
know our generation,

00:58:51.230 --> 00:58:57.450 position:56%
all of us are the first humans to be
able to see the entire sun at once.

00:58:57.450 --> 00:59:01.490 position:56%
Because we have spacecraft
everywhere, we actually see the sun.

00:59:01.490 --> 00:59:04.330
All of it at one time.

00:59:04.330 --> 00:59:06.960
We don't just see the
part that's facing us.

00:59:06.960 --> 00:59:09.910
And that's the first time
that's ever happened.

00:59:11.860 --> 00:59:16.900
And so, as I mentioned, we
use space weather forecasting

00:59:16.900 --> 00:59:18.330
for all the way out to Pluto.

00:59:18.330 --> 00:59:19.630
So, here's New Horizon.

00:59:19.630 --> 00:59:23.590
So, when the New Horizon Mission
was getting close to Pluto,

00:59:23.590 --> 00:59:26.730
they contacted the NASA space
weather forecasters and said,

00:59:26.730 --> 00:59:28.730
all right we want you
to give us six months

00:59:28.730 --> 00:59:31.240
of all the stuff that's
coming off the sun,

00:59:31.240 --> 00:59:34.980
so we know what we
should expect out here.

00:59:34.980 --> 00:59:38.280
Because we have instruments,
but we have no idea.

00:59:38.280 --> 00:59:42.600
So, it's like being somewhere
and actually having rain gages

00:59:42.600 --> 00:59:47.720
and things like that on your
car, but you don't actually have,

00:59:47.720 --> 00:59:50.230
you don't actually have the
Weather Channel and the radar maps

00:59:50.230 --> 00:59:52.330
to know what's happening
where you are.

00:59:52.330 --> 00:59:53.670
So, you call somebody
and you say, hey,

00:59:53.670 --> 00:59:57.070
can you tell me what it's
going to be like where I am.

00:59:57.070 --> 00:59:59.370
And so, that's what they did.

00:59:59.370 --> 01:00:02.070
And so, we make these kinds
of forecasts that are just

01:00:02.070 --> 01:00:06.720
like a hurricane forecast
for the entire solar system,

01:00:06.720 --> 01:00:08.860 position:56%
to know what's happening everywhere.

01:00:08.860 --> 01:00:15.140
So, I want to end, this is
actually a kind of a cool,

01:00:15.140 --> 01:00:17.580
this is just to show you;
it's a little bit hard to see,

01:00:17.580 --> 01:00:20.730
it's kind of dim but just to show
you how dynamic the Aurora is.

01:00:20.730 --> 01:00:27.280
So, this is on a scale
of tens of minutes.

01:00:27.280 --> 01:00:29.970
So, it's moving pretty fast.

01:00:29.970 --> 01:00:33.740
But I want to end with
one last thing.

01:00:33.740 --> 01:00:37.220
So, I hope everyone gets a
chance to experience this.

01:00:37.220 --> 01:00:43.860
Next year, 2017, August 21st there
will be a total solar eclipse.

01:00:43.860 --> 01:00:48.550
And that path of totality,
which is about 60 miles wide,

01:00:48.550 --> 01:00:53.980 position:56%
is going to start here in Oregon and
travel down through South Carolina.

01:00:53.980 --> 01:00:59.570
Now, we're going to be over here,
we're going to see about 85%

01:00:59.570 --> 01:01:05.750
of a partial eclipse, 85%
of the sun will be covered.

01:01:05.750 --> 01:01:10.550
But, this is the first time
we've had a total solar eclipse

01:01:10.550 --> 01:01:13.700
since the late seventies in the US.

01:01:13.700 --> 01:01:15.470
It's first time we've
had one that's gone

01:01:15.470 --> 01:01:19.740
across the entire US
since the early 1900s.

01:01:19.740 --> 01:01:22.520
the next time this will happen
that it's going to go all the way

01:01:22.520 --> 01:01:26.230
across the US will be 2045.

01:01:26.230 --> 01:01:30.010
We will have another total solar
eclipse that's going to start here

01:01:30.010 --> 01:01:38.690
and move like this in 2024.

01:01:38.690 --> 01:01:40.780
We are not going to get totality.

01:01:40.780 --> 01:01:42.490
We're again going to
be really close.

01:01:42.490 --> 01:01:43.790
But it will be easier for us.

01:01:43.790 --> 01:01:45.460
It's going to go like this I think.

01:01:45.460 --> 01:01:50.050
So, you can drive just up in
Northern Pennsylvania I think.

01:01:50.050 --> 01:01:54.580
The interesting thing is that
this totality in 2024 passes

01:01:54.580 --> 01:01:58.170
over the one that's
happening next year.

01:01:58.170 --> 01:02:01.810
But I highly recommend,
if you can take the time

01:02:01.810 --> 01:02:04.980
to travel somewhere along this line

01:02:04.980 --> 01:02:07.930
because you will not
be disappointed.

01:02:07.930 --> 01:02:10.120
So, if you want more
information about this,

01:02:10.120 --> 01:02:16.730
go to eclipse2017.nasa.gov.

01:02:16.730 --> 01:02:19.690
But this is a really
spectacular event.

01:02:19.690 --> 01:02:21.880
And I hope everyone
gets to participate.

01:02:21.880 --> 01:02:25.660
And even if you can't go, there
are going to be broadcasts

01:02:25.660 --> 01:02:27.620 position:56%
from numerous folks, including NASA,

01:02:27.620 --> 01:02:30.870
but also for example
Exploratorium in San Francisco.

01:02:30.870 --> 01:02:34.600
Other organizations are going to
have live broadcasts and webcasts

01:02:34.600 --> 01:02:37.030
from all over the country.

01:02:37.030 --> 01:02:39.870
Now, anywhere along here
you will see totality

01:02:39.870 --> 01:02:42.290
for just over two minutes.

01:02:42.290 --> 01:02:45.860
Roughly about two and
a half minutes.

01:02:45.860 --> 01:02:48.850
Which doesn't seem like that long,
but it actually is pretty long.

01:02:48.850 --> 01:02:52.050
It will be almost like night.

01:02:52.050 --> 01:02:56.000
It's an amazing experience.

01:02:56.000 --> 01:03:00.580
So, I hope everybody gets a chance
to take a look and try it out.

01:03:00.580 --> 01:03:10.670
So, at this point, I want to
end it and open up the floor

01:03:10.670 --> 01:03:12.500
for questions [applause].

01:03:12.500 --> 01:03:13.870
&gt;&gt; STEPHANIE MARCUS: Well, first

01:03:13.870 --> 01:03:17.360
of all [inaudible] thank
you very much Dr. Jones.

01:03:17.360 --> 01:03:19.420
And what's your questions?

01:03:19.420 --> 01:03:21.790
We could go on and on.

01:03:21.790 --> 01:03:23.090
&gt;&gt; C. ALEX YOUNG: So,
in the very back

01:03:23.090 --> 01:03:26.880
of the room a gentleman
had a question.

01:03:26.880 --> 01:03:28.180
&gt;&gt; Two questions.

01:03:28.180 --> 01:03:30.170
[Inaudible] and one more abstract.

01:03:30.170 --> 01:03:36.150
[Inaudible] question how do you
specifically define the word field,

01:03:36.150 --> 01:03:38.270
f-i-e-l-d.

01:03:38.270 --> 01:03:40.710
&gt;&gt; C. ALEX YOUNG: How do you
specifically define field

01:03:40.710 --> 01:03:42.220
in physics okay.

01:03:42.220 --> 01:03:46.720
&gt;&gt; Second question, what
is a Wolf-Rayet star.

01:03:46.720 --> 01:03:49.740
&gt;&gt; C. ALEX YOUNG: What is
a Wolf-Rayet star, okay.

01:03:52.040 --> 01:04:03.340
Okay. Well, a field is
something that, let's see.

01:04:03.340 --> 01:04:06.420
That's a tough one.

01:04:06.420 --> 01:04:08.480
It describes.

01:04:08.480 --> 01:04:16.150
Yeah, a field describes some
phenomenon that is continuous.

01:04:16.150 --> 01:04:23.530
That is, it has every point
you can pick any point

01:04:23.530 --> 01:04:27.430
and that field describes
the strength

01:04:27.430 --> 01:04:29.390
of this phenomenon at that point.

01:04:29.390 --> 01:04:32.350 position:56%
Like magnetic field, electric field.

01:04:32.350 --> 01:04:37.340 position:56%
So, but it is a continuous structure

01:04:37.340 --> 01:04:42.780
that defines some sort
of force or quantity.

01:04:42.780 --> 01:04:45.410
Flow of fluid something like that.

01:04:45.410 --> 01:04:49.900
Wolf-Rayet star is, my
astronomy's a little rusty on this.

01:04:49.900 --> 01:04:54.870
I believe a Wolf-Rayet
star is a young,

01:04:54.870 --> 01:04:57.540
a very, very young active star.

01:04:57.540 --> 01:05:00.090
But I honestly don't remember
I'd have to look it up.

01:05:00.090 --> 01:05:02.720
I'm a little rusty
on my star physics.

01:05:02.720 --> 01:05:06.570 position:56%
&gt;&gt; I'm familiar with Wolf-Rayet 104.

01:05:06.570 --> 01:05:09.820
&gt;&gt; C. ALEX YOUNG: Well,
that's from "Star Trek."

01:05:09.820 --> 01:05:14.770
&gt;&gt; STEPHANIE MARCUS: Let's
give somebody else a chance.

01:05:14.770 --> 01:05:18.460
You can come up later and
ask a few more questions.

01:05:18.460 --> 01:05:19.760
&gt;&gt; C. ALEX YOUNG: Okay.

01:05:19.760 --> 01:05:21.060
Go ahead.

01:05:21.060 --> 01:05:30.120 position:56%
&gt;&gt; About what time of day will this
solar eclipse happen on August 21st?

01:05:30.120 --> 01:05:31.420 position:56%
&gt;&gt; C. ALEX YOUNG: Yeah so it starts,

01:05:31.420 --> 01:05:35.470
let's see on the west coast
it starts around 10:30.

01:05:35.470 --> 01:05:39.620
You know what I've got little
thing here, a little brochure

01:05:39.620 --> 01:05:48.450
that actually has the
details, let me pull it out.

01:05:48.450 --> 01:05:51.570
So, let's see well
central time for example

01:05:51.570 --> 01:05:53.900
in Alabama, it's around noon.

01:05:53.900 --> 01:05:59.580
So, it's going to be just at
about 1:30 I think around here.

01:05:59.580 --> 01:06:01.100
Yeah. So, it's going to go

01:06:01.100 --> 01:06:05.690
on for several hours starting
over on the west coast.

01:06:05.690 --> 01:06:07.330
But if you go

01:06:07.330 --> 01:06:11.360
to eclipse2017.nasa.gov you can
get more details about that.

01:06:11.360 --> 01:06:13.200
And we have these maps too, so.

01:06:13.200 --> 01:06:14.500
Yes, sir?

01:06:14.500 --> 01:06:16.640
&gt;&gt; In terms of the
effects on astronauts

01:06:16.640 --> 01:06:18.580
who are outside of [inaudible].

01:06:18.580 --> 01:06:23.810
I know there's been specific
studies on the astronauts

01:06:23.810 --> 01:06:27.660 position:56%
in the Space Station for long
periods as to the effects of gravity

01:06:27.660 --> 01:06:31.130
and you know biological type.

01:06:31.130 --> 01:06:36.790
Have there been any actual studies
of the effects of the space litter

01:06:36.790 --> 01:06:39.420
in general or the increased
radiation on them.

01:06:39.420 --> 01:06:44.380
Have there been any increased
incidence of cancer or?

01:06:44.380 --> 01:06:45.680
&gt;&gt; C. ALEX YOUNG: There have.

01:06:45.680 --> 01:06:48.950
Well, all of the astronauts, for
example wear radiation badges.

01:06:48.950 --> 01:06:51.170
Because they're basically
considered radiation workers.

01:06:51.170 --> 01:06:56.700
Just like many airline workers
are considered radiation workers.

01:06:56.700 --> 01:06:58.340
So, they do monitor that.

01:06:58.340 --> 01:06:59.870
They do have various
kinds of equipment

01:06:59.870 --> 01:07:04.840
to monitor, as a proxy for humans.

01:07:04.840 --> 01:07:10.610
I don't know what the long-term
studies are on ISS astronauts.

01:07:10.610 --> 01:07:14.320
But I do know that there have been
a lot of studies recently related

01:07:14.320 --> 01:07:16.920
to Apollo astronauts
and they do have,

01:07:16.920 --> 01:07:22.710
it's my understanding there's
statistically significant increase

01:07:22.710 --> 01:07:27.510
in cancer and impact
amongst Apollo astronauts.

01:07:27.510 --> 01:07:33.310 position:56%
And they of course were exposed to
the most radiation, more so than ISS

01:07:33.310 --> 01:07:36.730
because ISS still gets some of
the magnetic field protection.

01:07:36.730 --> 01:07:40.440
And the materials are better now.

01:07:40.440 --> 01:07:43.380
But I do know this is an
active area of research.

01:07:43.380 --> 01:07:47.800
And there's a group for example
at Johnson Space Center in Houston

01:07:47.800 --> 01:07:51.780
that actively works with
the NASA forecasters,

01:07:51.780 --> 01:07:55.590
but they study the impacts
specifically for our astronauts.

01:07:55.590 --> 01:07:58.410
&gt;&gt; Just as a quick follow up,
if you look at that effect

01:07:58.410 --> 01:08:03.960
and the gravity effects and
all the rest, does it make you

01:08:03.960 --> 01:08:07.510
as a NASA scientist, does it
make you wonder if we talk

01:08:07.510 --> 01:08:11.940
about increasing man flights or
starting man flights to Mars,

01:08:11.940 --> 01:08:15.220
if this is really a feasible idea?

01:08:15.220 --> 01:08:16.520
&gt;&gt; C. ALEX YOUNG: It does.

01:08:16.520 --> 01:08:18.770
I mean I'm not an expert on
it, so I certainly don't speak

01:08:18.770 --> 01:08:21.150
from a NASA point of view.

01:08:21.150 --> 01:08:23.110
But, yeah it worries me.

01:08:23.110 --> 01:08:28.020
I mean it is a huge, huge issue.

01:08:28.020 --> 01:08:33.060
We do know that you know astronauts
experience anywhere from ten

01:08:33.060 --> 01:08:37.180
to more times the normal
radiation levels.

01:08:37.180 --> 01:08:39.910
I mean everybody experiences
radiation all the time.

01:08:39.910 --> 01:08:42.590
And that's there's normal
background radiation.

01:08:42.590 --> 01:08:46.130
But astronauts certainly
get significantly higher,

01:08:46.130 --> 01:08:47.430
and they know that.

01:08:47.430 --> 01:08:49.200
They're well aware of that.

01:08:49.200 --> 01:08:54.020 position:56%
But yeah, it's going to be really,
really harsh on a nine-month journey

01:08:54.020 --> 01:08:59.190
to Mars with cosmic rays, not
even necessarily the solar aspect,

01:08:59.190 --> 01:09:02.180
but just the continuous
amount of cosmic rays.

01:09:02.180 --> 01:09:05.210
Because again, these sorts
of things, we're not really,

01:09:05.210 --> 01:09:10.840
the issues is not as much
acute, short-term huge impacts,

01:09:10.840 --> 01:09:12.430
which is certainly still a problem.

01:09:12.430 --> 01:09:14.360
It's really that long term

01:09:14.360 --> 01:09:18.440
because the way radiation is
measured is your cumulative dose

01:09:18.440 --> 01:09:19.740
over time.

01:09:19.740 --> 01:09:22.480
Because the same thing with
pilots and with astronauts.

01:09:22.480 --> 01:09:25.440
They have a limit as to how
much radiation they can get.

01:09:25.440 --> 01:09:28.090
And they will be grounded,
and many have been grounded,

01:09:28.090 --> 01:09:30.300
after they have reached
that threshold.

01:09:30.300 --> 01:09:35.470
So, they're going to have to
change those thresholds for Mars

01:09:35.470 --> 01:09:37.860
because it's going to
be much, much different.

01:09:37.860 --> 01:09:40.300
Yes, sir?

01:09:40.300 --> 01:09:46.530
&gt;&gt; Given the current measurements
of solar activity at the surface

01:09:46.530 --> 01:09:51.120
of the sun, is it possible
to predict solar flares,

01:09:51.120 --> 01:09:53.540
and if so how far in
advance and with what kind

01:09:53.540 --> 01:09:54.840
of [inaudible] resolution?

01:09:54.840 --> 01:09:58.880
&gt;&gt; C. ALEX YOUNG: Okay, so the
question is basically are we able

01:09:58.880 --> 01:10:01.930
to predict solar flares
and with what kind

01:10:01.930 --> 01:10:04.760
of for resolution,
timescale resolution.

01:10:04.760 --> 01:10:07.150
That's a great question.

01:10:07.150 --> 01:10:10.530
That's a really, really,
really hard problem.

01:10:10.530 --> 01:10:16.470
Right now, we are only able
to forecast solar flares

01:10:16.470 --> 01:10:20.090
on a statistical basis,
about the same

01:10:20.090 --> 01:10:23.900
as how we forecast
precipitation percentages.

01:10:23.900 --> 01:10:29.730 position:56%
So, the way right now precipitation,
when you see 80% is that they look

01:10:29.730 --> 01:10:35.430
at equivalent conditions in the
same location over a certain amount

01:10:35.430 --> 01:10:38.180
of time and say 8 out of 10 times

01:10:38.180 --> 01:10:41.310
when the day was like
today, it rained.

01:10:41.310 --> 01:10:43.350
So, there's 80% chance
it's going to rain.

01:10:43.350 --> 01:10:46.570
And that's really about the best
we can do with solar flares.

01:10:46.570 --> 01:10:51.650
We look at the sunspots and
the structure of the sunspots,

01:10:51.650 --> 01:10:52.970
and the magnetic field strengths.

01:10:52.970 --> 01:10:57.350
And we look at that particular
type of sunspot configuration.

01:10:57.350 --> 01:11:02.040
And we look at past examples of
that over multiple solar cycles

01:11:02.040 --> 01:11:06.750
and we say, well 8 out of 10 times
we say this particular shaped

01:11:06.750 --> 01:11:11.700
sunspot with this magnificent
field configuration and it produced

01:11:11.700 --> 01:11:14.370
so many flares of a certain size.

01:11:14.370 --> 01:11:16.330
And that's the way the
percentages are done.

01:11:16.330 --> 01:11:21.580
So, that's a really, it's not a
really very strongly way to do it.

01:11:21.580 --> 01:11:25.920
Because we're not able to currently
do it based on the physics.

01:11:25.920 --> 01:11:27.750
I mean ideally that's what
you want to be able to do.

01:11:27.750 --> 01:11:31.800
You want to really be able to
look at the physics and say,

01:11:31.800 --> 01:11:34.050
we measured these physical
parameters

01:11:34.050 --> 01:11:40.290
and we can give you some
sort of robust estimate

01:11:40.290 --> 01:11:43.680
of what's the probability
of a flare.

01:11:43.680 --> 01:11:47.490
Right now, for example, the best
measure of whether we're going

01:11:47.490 --> 01:11:50.220
to have a flare is if
we've already had one.

01:11:50.220 --> 01:11:52.700
Yeah. So, it is a tough problem.

01:11:52.700 --> 01:11:54.650
And unfortunately, I don't
really have a very good answer

01:11:54.650 --> 01:11:56.430
because there isn't one.

01:11:56.430 --> 01:11:57.730
Yeah. Yes, ma'am.

01:11:57.730 --> 01:12:04.160
&gt;&gt; Is it possible that we can
feel the sunspot explosion?

01:12:04.160 --> 01:12:07.420
&gt;&gt; C. ALEX YOUNG: As far as
we've been able, now you will see

01:12:07.420 --> 01:12:12.310
in different types of
literature and folks will say,

01:12:12.310 --> 01:12:17.720
well you know I'm affected by
solar activity blah, blah, blah.

01:12:17.720 --> 01:12:20.650
As far as we can tell no.

01:12:20.650 --> 01:12:24.160
No. because one of the
things is we are, again,

01:12:24.160 --> 01:12:26.350
fortunately very well protected

01:12:26.350 --> 01:12:30.360
by our atmosphere and
our magnetic field.

01:12:30.360 --> 01:12:35.990
The thing about physics when
you talk about impacts, I mean,

01:12:35.990 --> 01:12:39.200
honestly almost everything
affects everything else

01:12:39.200 --> 01:12:41.160
to some degree, but how much.

01:12:41.160 --> 01:12:44.030
And is it at all significant.

01:12:44.030 --> 01:12:45.890
And that's really the
way physics works.

01:12:45.890 --> 01:12:51.190
I mean if I have a magnet across
that room, like a small bar magnet,

01:12:51.190 --> 01:12:54.740
there is a measurable, there
is a magnetic field here

01:12:54.740 --> 01:12:57.870
from that magnet across the room.

01:12:57.870 --> 01:13:02.700
But it may, it will be
extremely, extremely weak.

01:13:02.700 --> 01:13:06.390
And probably I will not
be able to measure it.

01:13:06.390 --> 01:13:09.230
But I can tell you based on
what I know about physics,

01:13:09.230 --> 01:13:13.420 position:56%
there is a magnetic field here from
that magnetic field across the room.

01:13:13.420 --> 01:13:16.170
But, there's also magnetic
fields from everything else

01:13:16.170 --> 01:13:18.260
around me that's being produced

01:13:18.260 --> 01:13:21.190
that are probably significantly
stronger than that.

01:13:21.190 --> 01:13:25.050
And so, more than likely, even
though there is a field here,

01:13:25.050 --> 01:13:26.800
it really isn't affecting me.

01:13:26.800 --> 01:13:29.320
Not in any sort of measurable way.

01:13:29.320 --> 01:13:32.560
And this is the same sort of
thing with space weather impact.

01:13:32.560 --> 01:13:37.510 position:56%
And as space weather becomes sort of
more popular and in the public eye,

01:13:37.510 --> 01:13:43.560
I do hear a lot more about that,
about the impact to all sorts

01:13:43.560 --> 01:13:47.840
of physical aspects and there
just really is no evidence

01:13:47.840 --> 01:13:49.700
that that's the case.

01:13:49.700 --> 01:13:54.980
I would be much more worried about
you know walking by a hospital

01:13:54.980 --> 01:13:58.950
with an MRI machine than I
would about the sun in terms

01:13:58.950 --> 01:14:01.730
of magnetic fields and
that sort of stuff.

01:14:01.730 --> 01:14:03.270
Yes, ma'am?

01:14:03.270 --> 01:14:07.980
&gt;&gt; Has anybody ever
worked at NASA if they have

01:14:07.980 --> 01:14:10.650
to reignite the sun if it went out?

01:14:10.650 --> 01:14:11.950
&gt;&gt; C. ALEX YOUNG: Oh,
that's a cool question.

01:14:11.950 --> 01:14:15.600
So, has anyone ever worked to if
they have to reignite the sun.

01:14:15.600 --> 01:14:16.990
I don't know.

01:14:16.990 --> 01:14:20.220
I mean I certainly, being a
science fiction fan have seen lots

01:14:20.220 --> 01:14:21.560
of cool stuff about that.

01:14:21.560 --> 01:14:26.000
I don't know if anybody would
think about it too much,

01:14:26.000 --> 01:14:29.300
because I think most people would
sort of feel like well if we had

01:14:29.300 --> 01:14:31.600
to reignite the sun it
would mean the sun was out,

01:14:31.600 --> 01:14:34.230
and if the sun was out,
we'd really be in bad shape.

01:14:34.230 --> 01:14:40.030 position:56%
So, probably most people who thought
about that first thought that if

01:14:40.030 --> 01:14:42.970
that was the situation, I
wouldn't really be here,

01:14:42.970 --> 01:14:45.670
so there really wouldn't be
much I could do about it.

01:14:45.670 --> 01:14:49.040 position:56%
But, I think that's a cool question.

01:14:49.040 --> 01:14:50.340
&gt;&gt; STEPHANIE MARCUS:
Well, thanks again.

01:14:50.340 --> 01:14:52.270
I guess we better stop and
if you want to come up,

01:14:52.270 --> 01:14:54.910
he's got a few more minutes
before he has to get to a meeting.

01:14:54.910 --> 01:14:59.840
Thank you [applause].

01:14:59.840 --> 01:15:03.490
&gt;&gt; This has been a presentation
of the Library of Congress.
