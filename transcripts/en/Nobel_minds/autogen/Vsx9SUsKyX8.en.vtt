00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:01.730
 
so the way that I like to describe my

00:00:01.730 --> 00:00:01.740
so the way that I like to describe my
 

00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:05.889
so the way that I like to describe my
work is that it's it's developing

00:00:05.889 --> 00:00:05.899
work is that it's it's developing
 

00:00:05.899 --> 00:00:08.900
work is that it's it's developing
statistical methods to do something

00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:08.910
statistical methods to do something
 

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:11.030
statistical methods to do something
without having to do everything so let

00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:11.040
without having to do everything so let
 

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:13.030
without having to do everything so let
me elaborate a little bit on that I'm

00:00:13.030 --> 00:00:13.040
me elaborate a little bit on that I'm
 

00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:15.110
me elaborate a little bit on that I'm
particularly interested in is linkages

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:15.120
particularly interested in is linkages
 

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:18.109
particularly interested in is linkages
between the overall macro economy and

00:00:18.109 --> 00:00:18.119
between the overall macro economy and
 

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:21.320
between the overall macro economy and
financial markets and so one could

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:21.330
financial markets and so one could
 

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:23.120
financial markets and so one could
imagine that to do this with a model

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:23.130
imagine that to do this with a model
 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:24.590
imagine that to do this with a model
you've got to have a detailed model the

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:24.600
you've got to have a detailed model the
 

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:26.060
you've got to have a detailed model the
macro economy you've got to have a

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:26.070
macro economy you've got to have a
 

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:29.240
macro economy you've got to have a
detailed inside that a detailed model of

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:29.250
detailed inside that a detailed model of
 

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:30.919
detailed inside that a detailed model of
the how financial markets work inside

00:00:30.919 --> 00:00:30.929
the how financial markets work inside
 

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:33.110
the how financial markets work inside
that economy in order to kind of get off

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:33.120
that economy in order to kind of get off
 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:36.620
that economy in order to kind of get off
the ground and it's very handy is to

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:36.630
the ground and it's very handy is to
 

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:38.690
the ground and it's very handy is to
instead just be able to do pieces of

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:38.700
instead just be able to do pieces of
 

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:40.490
instead just be able to do pieces of
that without having to do the whole

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:40.500
that without having to do the whole
 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:42.830
that without having to do the whole
thing simultaneously and so the methods

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:42.840
thing simultaneously and so the methods
 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:44.869
thing simultaneously and so the methods
that that I developed were aimed at

00:00:44.869 --> 00:00:44.879
that that I developed were aimed at
 

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:47.209
that that I developed were aimed at
being able to understand that piece

00:00:47.209 --> 00:00:47.219
being able to understand that piece
 

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:48.500
being able to understand that piece
without having to have a full-blown

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:48.510
without having to have a full-blown
 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:52.130
without having to have a full-blown
model of both financial markets and the

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:52.140
model of both financial markets and the
 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:54.200
model of both financial markets and the
entire economy eventually one has to put

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:54.210
entire economy eventually one has to put
 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:56.029
entire economy eventually one has to put
all the pieces together but but it's

00:00:56.029 --> 00:00:56.039
all the pieces together but but it's
 

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:58.069
all the pieces together but but it's
nice to be able to kind of look at a

00:00:58.069 --> 00:00:58.079
nice to be able to kind of look at a
 

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:01.459
nice to be able to kind of look at a
portion of it and then when we come back

00:01:01.459 --> 00:01:01.469
portion of it and then when we come back
 

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:03.049
portion of it and then when we come back
and add much more detail along these

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:03.059
and add much more detail along these
 

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:05.989
and add much more detail along these
various different dimensions
