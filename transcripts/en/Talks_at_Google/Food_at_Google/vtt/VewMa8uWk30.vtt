00:00:02.260 --> 00:00:05.040
SHANNON: She's a fourth
generation Argentine vintner

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:11.080
and an emergency physician in
San Francisco at UCSF and CPMC

00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:12.820
Children's Hospital.

00:00:12.820 --> 00:00:15.880
She grew up in Argentina during
the military dictatorship,

00:00:15.880 --> 00:00:17.750
finished high school
in the East Bay,

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:21.970
and studied biology at Harvard
and medicine at Stanford.

00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:25.210
Today, she's managing director
of her family winery, Bodega

00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:28.630
Catena Zapata, and makes
her own wines in Argentina

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:32.590
under the Luca label, and is a
practicing emergency physician

00:00:32.590 --> 00:00:36.010
in San Francisco
at CPMC and UCSF.

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:39.620
She's the author of "Vino
Argentino, an Insider's Guide

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:42.150
to Wines and the Wine
Country of Argentina,"

00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:45.440
which was published by Chronicle
Books at the end of 2010.

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:47.510
It's the first
English language book

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:49.475
about Argentine food and wine.

00:00:49.475 --> 00:00:51.629
With that, I'll turn
it over to Laura.

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:53.420
LAURA CATENA: Thank
you very much, Shannon.

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:56.840
I think I'm speaking with this.

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:58.590
I feel like I don't
to say anything now,

00:00:58.590 --> 00:00:59.600
but thank you very much.

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:01.130
Shannon.

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:04.200
So today we're going to talk
a little bit about my book,

00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:07.550
"Vino Argentino," about
Argentina, my country, my wine

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:10.830
region, Mendoza, a
little bit about Malbec,

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:13.450
a little bit about my
family's 100-year-old history

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:19.560
making wine, and also I'll share
a bit of my personal story.

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:25.120
These are the main principles
that we live by at our winery.

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:26.170
Compete with the best.

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:28.720
Although we are in a
developing country,

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:31.500
we try to make
wines that can stand

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:33.160
with the best of the world.

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:34.350
Be academic.

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:37.440
When we don't know something,
we study, we do research,

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:40.600
and we're humble about what we
know and what we don't know.

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:43.600
And believe fiercely
in what we do,

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:47.100
so that others will
also believe in us.

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:50.830
So this is my father,
Nicolas Catena and my uncle,

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:53.290
Jorge and my tia, Silvia.

00:01:53.290 --> 00:01:57.650
My father grew up in a very
tiny village in Mendoza.

00:01:57.650 --> 00:02:00.580
And at the age of
five, he started

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:03.030
working in the vineyard
with his father.

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:06.650
At the age of five, my kids were
working on their PlayStation

00:02:06.650 --> 00:02:08.990
skills, like probably
some of you were.

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:14.440
This is my great-grandfather,
Nicola Catena,

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:18.710
that came to Argentina
from Italy in 1898

00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:21.230
with the dream of planting
a vineyard of his own.

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:25.490
I imagine some of you, your
parents, your grandparents,

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:30.310
immigrated to the United
States with great dreams.

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:33.350
And this is my grandmother,
Angelica Zapata.

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:36.100
We have a vineyard and
a wine named after her.

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:37.780
And unfortunately,
I never met her

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:41.510
because she died in a car
accident when my father was 18.

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:45.150
But she is a very important
part of our family folklore.

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:47.680
She was the headmaster
of the local school.

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:51.150
And she was a very tough
mother, according to my father.

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:54.360
And she believed
that education was

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:57.960
the way to progress and
to improving our society.

00:02:57.960 --> 00:03:01.854
And she was known to go
get kids at their home

00:03:01.854 --> 00:03:02.770
if they missed school.

00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:05.061
Because many times, the
parents would keep them at home

00:03:05.061 --> 00:03:06.181
so that they would work.

00:03:06.181 --> 00:03:07.930
And she would actually
drive to the house,

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:12.000
sometimes even pay the parents
and bring the kid to school.

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:16.000
And my father tells a story of
when he was 18 years old, right

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:17.870
before she died, and
he went to her saying

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:20.400
that he wanted to study
physics, and said to her,

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:22.640
what should I do with
a degree in physics?

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:26.500
And she said, you should
try to win the Nobel Prize.

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:28.880
And maybe you guys talk
about winning the Nobel Prize

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:34.230
at Google, but he was a child
in a very small village.

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:36.630
And to have this
sort of expectation

00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:39.120
explains a lot of
what happened after.

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:44.200
And it also explains possibly
some of my childhood traumas.

00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:47.500
So this is actually
a framed copy

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:52.270
of a review from Robert
Parker's, the wine advocate.

00:03:52.270 --> 00:03:54.460
Does anybody know--
does everybody

00:03:54.460 --> 00:03:55.640
know who is Robert Parker?

00:03:55.640 --> 00:03:58.910
So he's this very
famous wine reviewer.

00:03:58.910 --> 00:04:02.600
And he gave one of our
wines 98 plus points.

00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:05.020
And this was the first time
that an Argentine wine,

00:04:05.020 --> 00:04:06.860
or a South American
wine actually,

00:04:06.860 --> 00:04:08.330
had received such a high rating.

00:04:08.330 --> 00:04:10.800
So I put it in a frame
for my winemaker.

00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:12.870
And the next day,
I came over and I

00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:14.660
saw that he'd crossed
it off and he said,

00:04:14.660 --> 00:04:17.370
quiero cien, which
means, I want 100.

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:20.180
And at first I thought well,
this guy's a little ungrateful.

00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:21.920
And then I thought,
you know, no.

00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:24.190
This is the kind of
person that will actually

00:04:24.190 --> 00:04:25.970
make 100 point wine.

00:04:25.970 --> 00:04:30.060
Because he won't be happy
until he achieves the top.

00:04:33.030 --> 00:04:35.310
So Argentina is an
amazing country.

00:04:35.310 --> 00:04:38.060
Those of you who've been
there or who were born there,

00:04:38.060 --> 00:04:40.190
know what a beautiful
place it is.

00:04:40.190 --> 00:04:42.070
We have monkeys in
the north, penguins

00:04:42.070 --> 00:04:45.010
in the south, beautiful
plains with cattle.

00:04:45.010 --> 00:04:46.840
We are one of the
largest producers

00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:47.930
of soybean in the world.

00:04:47.930 --> 00:04:49.010
We have tango.

00:04:49.010 --> 00:04:51.340
We're my tango dancer?

00:04:51.340 --> 00:04:54.130
We have such incredible
culture there.

00:04:54.130 --> 00:04:57.720
But it's also a country
with an incredible economic

00:04:57.720 --> 00:04:58.930
instability.

00:04:58.930 --> 00:05:03.170
So during my childhood, this
is what inflation looked like.

00:05:03.170 --> 00:05:05.890
So imagine living
in a country where

00:05:05.890 --> 00:05:09.880
you have 30, 40, 50,
3,000% inflation.

00:05:09.880 --> 00:05:12.830
And one thing I remember as
a child is that you always

00:05:12.830 --> 00:05:15.070
spent your money,
because you never

00:05:15.070 --> 00:05:19.380
knew how much it would
be worth a week later.

00:05:19.380 --> 00:05:21.230
And believe me,
it's very difficult.

00:05:21.230 --> 00:05:23.550
Currently, the inflation
rate is about 30%.

00:05:23.550 --> 00:05:27.200
And it's not easy to do
business in this environment.

00:05:27.200 --> 00:05:29.420
And it's also a
country where there's

00:05:29.420 --> 00:05:31.600
been a lot of political turmoil.

00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:34.980
During my childhood, there
were two military coups.

00:05:34.980 --> 00:05:39.460
And more recently in 2001,
we had riots in the streets.

00:05:39.460 --> 00:05:42.420
And we had five
presidents in one week.

00:05:42.420 --> 00:05:44.700
These are all the presidents.

00:05:44.700 --> 00:05:46.370
We currently have
a female president.

00:05:49.620 --> 00:05:55.660
So in the late
'70s, we were living

00:05:55.660 --> 00:05:57.810
in a militarized country.

00:05:57.810 --> 00:06:01.760
And my father had to negotiate
the release of my uncle

00:06:01.760 --> 00:06:02.630
by kidnappers.

00:06:02.630 --> 00:06:04.900
He had been kept in
a closet for a week.

00:06:04.900 --> 00:06:06.860
And my brother and
I had been sent

00:06:06.860 --> 00:06:09.110
to a boarding school
in the countryside.

00:06:09.110 --> 00:06:11.210
And it wasn't like the
fancy boarding schools

00:06:11.210 --> 00:06:12.090
that you have here.

00:06:12.090 --> 00:06:14.730
It was really in a village
in the countryside.

00:06:14.730 --> 00:06:16.584
And when I was 10
years old-- I was

00:06:16.584 --> 00:06:18.500
five when I started--
when I was 10 years old,

00:06:18.500 --> 00:06:20.000
I was once sitting
in a classroom

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:23.860
and some guys in big
military gear kicked the door

00:06:23.860 --> 00:06:25.770
and pointed guns at us.

00:06:25.770 --> 00:06:27.350
And the reason
they were there was

00:06:27.350 --> 00:06:30.120
because they thought that
there were [INAUDIBLE], which

00:06:30.120 --> 00:06:33.769
is our word for terrorist,
hiding in our school.

00:06:33.769 --> 00:06:35.060
And our school was closed down.

00:06:35.060 --> 00:06:36.910
We came back to Buenos Aires.

00:06:36.910 --> 00:06:38.830
And at that time,
my father decided

00:06:38.830 --> 00:06:41.530
to take a sabbatical
in Berkeley.

00:06:41.530 --> 00:06:43.580
And the one thing I
wanted to talk about,

00:06:43.580 --> 00:06:46.360
and recently I was reading
a book called "I Am Malala."

00:06:46.360 --> 00:06:48.810
I don't if any of
you have read it.

00:06:48.810 --> 00:06:50.950
Anybody here read "I Am Malala?"

00:06:50.950 --> 00:06:54.560
It's a book about this
young girl in Pakistan

00:06:54.560 --> 00:06:56.930
who is shot by the Taliban.

00:06:56.930 --> 00:06:59.740
And she has this horrible
story of how she's shot.

00:06:59.740 --> 00:07:03.020
But most of the book is
this joyful celebration

00:07:03.020 --> 00:07:06.890
of living in this country where
there's bombs and shootings.

00:07:06.890 --> 00:07:10.200
But she celebrates her life
with family and friends.

00:07:10.200 --> 00:07:12.930
And actually, when my father
said we were leaving Argentina,

00:07:12.930 --> 00:07:15.110
I was very upset, because
I was very happy there,

00:07:15.110 --> 00:07:17.310
despite all the
things are happening.

00:07:17.310 --> 00:07:20.050
But I was dragged to Berkeley.

00:07:20.050 --> 00:07:23.300
And there's a picture of
our family in Berkeley.

00:07:23.300 --> 00:07:26.560
This is my father holding my
baby sister who was born there,

00:07:26.560 --> 00:07:29.060
my mother, myself, and
my older brother who

00:07:29.060 --> 00:07:30.880
went off to college.

00:07:30.880 --> 00:07:35.140
And my father was a visiting
scholar at UC Berkeley.

00:07:35.140 --> 00:07:36.760
But more importantly,
what he learned

00:07:36.760 --> 00:07:39.040
about was this incredible
revolution that

00:07:39.040 --> 00:07:41.390
was going on in the Napa Valley.

00:07:41.390 --> 00:07:43.850
These crazy
Californians were saying

00:07:43.850 --> 00:07:47.210
that they were going to make
wines in California that

00:07:47.210 --> 00:07:49.500
could compete with
the best French wines.

00:07:49.500 --> 00:07:52.400
And I just want to take a little
survey of the room, who here

00:07:52.400 --> 00:07:55.870
thinks that California
can make wine that's

00:07:55.870 --> 00:07:57.780
as good as the
best French wines?

00:07:57.780 --> 00:07:59.210
Can we see some arms?

00:07:59.210 --> 00:07:59.710
OK.

00:07:59.710 --> 00:08:01.250
Who thinks, and
you guys, there's

00:08:01.250 --> 00:08:03.890
no military regime at
Google, I understand.

00:08:03.890 --> 00:08:08.010
Who here thinks that the
top French wines are still

00:08:08.010 --> 00:08:09.924
the best in the world?

00:08:09.924 --> 00:08:10.810
Oh, yeah.

00:08:10.810 --> 00:08:11.740
We got one.

00:08:11.740 --> 00:08:12.510
Excellent.

00:08:12.510 --> 00:08:13.310
[INAUDIBLE]

00:08:13.310 --> 00:08:14.430
Good for you.

00:08:14.430 --> 00:08:18.420
So anyhow, the Californians
have done a good job

00:08:18.420 --> 00:08:19.930
at convincing people.

00:08:19.930 --> 00:08:23.950
But at that time, for my father
to hear this was revolutionary.

00:08:23.950 --> 00:08:27.330
Because he had grown up
in a world where you never

00:08:27.330 --> 00:08:31.020
challenged the French, where
they dominated fine wine,

00:08:31.020 --> 00:08:33.840
and where he could never
imagine that somebody

00:08:33.840 --> 00:08:35.559
could compete with them.

00:08:35.559 --> 00:08:39.000
And then he heard about
the Judgment of Paris.

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:42.270
Have any of you seen the
movie "Bottle Shock?"

00:08:42.270 --> 00:08:46.430
So basically, this was a tasting
ran by an English man, Steven

00:08:46.430 --> 00:08:49.130
Spurrier, right here, with
a bunch of French judges,

00:08:49.130 --> 00:08:51.890
where they compared--
it was in 1976-- they

00:08:51.890 --> 00:08:55.510
compared California wine
against French wine.

00:08:55.510 --> 00:08:57.800
Does anybody know
who won the tasting?

00:08:57.800 --> 00:08:59.580
Anybody?

00:08:59.580 --> 00:09:00.080
?

00:09:00.080 --> 00:09:01.250
Yes?

00:09:01.250 --> 00:09:03.830
Chateau Montelena for
the chardonnay and Stag's

00:09:03.830 --> 00:09:05.590
Leap for the Cabernet Sauvignon.

00:09:05.590 --> 00:09:07.940
And actually, the
French people are still

00:09:07.940 --> 00:09:10.370
denying that this
tasting ever happened.

00:09:10.370 --> 00:09:12.880
But the Americans were
smart and made a movie.

00:09:12.880 --> 00:09:16.170
So that proves everything.

00:09:16.170 --> 00:09:18.170
So my father went
back to Argentina.

00:09:18.170 --> 00:09:22.090
And he said, if the
Californians can do it,

00:09:22.090 --> 00:09:26.010
why not me in Argentina.

00:09:26.010 --> 00:09:27.300
And this is just a side line.

00:09:27.300 --> 00:09:30.890
While my father was planning
this revolution in Argentina,

00:09:30.890 --> 00:09:34.626
I was actually perfecting
the Berkeley hippie look.

00:09:34.626 --> 00:09:37.150
I thought that was pretty good.

00:09:37.150 --> 00:09:38.800
I had a good time in Berkeley.

00:09:38.800 --> 00:09:41.520
Anybody here live in Berkeley?

00:09:41.520 --> 00:09:42.020
You guys?

00:09:42.020 --> 00:09:42.786
Yeah?

00:09:42.786 --> 00:09:44.020
It's a great place.

00:09:44.020 --> 00:09:49.070
So why was what my father was
trying to do so difficult?

00:09:49.070 --> 00:09:52.470
At that time, South
America was equivalent

00:09:52.470 --> 00:09:54.310
with cheap Chilean wine.

00:09:54.310 --> 00:09:56.580
And you guys seem kind
of young, so you may not

00:09:56.580 --> 00:09:59.120
have been drinking wine.

00:09:59.120 --> 00:10:02.360
This is the mid '80s.

00:10:02.360 --> 00:10:06.300
And at that time, South
America was cheap wine.

00:10:06.300 --> 00:10:08.910
And most people in
Argentina were saying,

00:10:08.910 --> 00:10:10.520
we need to do what
Chile's doing.

00:10:10.520 --> 00:10:11.870
They're doing very well with it.

00:10:11.870 --> 00:10:14.150
We should go along with
what they're doing.

00:10:14.150 --> 00:10:16.790
And when my father
said to his colleagues,

00:10:16.790 --> 00:10:18.696
I want to make these
wines that can stand

00:10:18.696 --> 00:10:21.120
with the best of the world,
they said first of all,

00:10:21.120 --> 00:10:22.420
we don't know if it's possible.

00:10:22.420 --> 00:10:24.220
But even if you
made those wines,

00:10:24.220 --> 00:10:28.350
no one will believe
that they're good.

00:10:28.350 --> 00:10:31.460
But my father was
not easily dissuaded.

00:10:31.460 --> 00:10:34.410
And I want to talk a
little bit about what

00:10:34.410 --> 00:10:35.910
I call the academic approach.

00:10:35.910 --> 00:10:39.580
This is actually my father
and my sister, Adrianna,

00:10:39.580 --> 00:10:41.830
she was the baby in
the Berkeley picture.

00:10:41.830 --> 00:10:46.470
She's getting a PhD in medieval
history at Oxford University.

00:10:46.470 --> 00:10:51.310
And I was in the car with my
sister, telling her, you know,

00:10:51.310 --> 00:10:54.410
I think it's funny when
dad talks about your thesis

00:10:54.410 --> 00:10:56.660
as if he knows as much
as you do about it.

00:10:56.660 --> 00:10:59.750
And my sister said, well he
actually knows more than I do.

00:10:59.750 --> 00:11:03.240
And my father is the kind of
person that loves to learn.

00:11:03.240 --> 00:11:05.800
And any time he sets his mind
to learning something new,

00:11:05.800 --> 00:11:06.640
he does.

00:11:06.640 --> 00:11:10.230
And actually here, my sister's
put him to work at the archives

00:11:10.230 --> 00:11:13.970
in [INAUDIBLE], studying
medieval Spanish history.

00:11:13.970 --> 00:11:15.690
So this kind of
academic approach

00:11:15.690 --> 00:11:18.290
is what he applied
to figuring out

00:11:18.290 --> 00:11:22.750
how to make these
wines in Argentina.

00:11:22.750 --> 00:11:25.640
And the first thing
he did was hire

00:11:25.640 --> 00:11:27.270
some well-known consultants.

00:11:27.270 --> 00:11:29.220
And his first
consultant was a guy

00:11:29.220 --> 00:11:31.580
from California
named Paul Hobbs.

00:11:31.580 --> 00:11:34.260
Has anybody had
Paul Hobb's wines?

00:11:34.260 --> 00:11:35.020
Yeah.

00:11:35.020 --> 00:11:37.560
Yeah, so he's a very
talented winemaker.

00:11:37.560 --> 00:11:39.100
He had made wine in France.

00:11:39.100 --> 00:11:41.200
He was making wine
in California.

00:11:41.200 --> 00:11:43.640
And when he came
to Argentina, we

00:11:43.640 --> 00:11:46.250
worked on how could
we go from the bottom

00:11:46.250 --> 00:11:48.110
up to make these wines.

00:11:48.110 --> 00:11:50.130
And the way wines
were being made

00:11:50.130 --> 00:11:52.400
in Argentina at that
time was in what

00:11:52.400 --> 00:11:55.820
we call the Italian
oxidative method.

00:11:55.820 --> 00:11:57.940
And what we would do is
we would press the grapes.

00:11:57.940 --> 00:12:01.770
And we would put them in these
huge old French oak barriques.

00:12:01.770 --> 00:12:03.960
And the wines would
receive oxygen.

00:12:03.960 --> 00:12:06.370
And what happens when
a wine gets oxygen

00:12:06.370 --> 00:12:09.080
is that it loses its
characteristics, its flavors.

00:12:09.080 --> 00:12:11.820
So imagine that you
leave a bottle out

00:12:11.820 --> 00:12:13.510
on the countertop for five days.

00:12:13.510 --> 00:12:14.629
You drink it.

00:12:14.629 --> 00:12:15.920
It doesn't taste like anything.

00:12:15.920 --> 00:12:17.045
Everything tastes the same.

00:12:17.045 --> 00:12:18.680
And that's how wine
was being made.

00:12:18.680 --> 00:12:22.050
So he realized that he
had to change everything

00:12:22.050 --> 00:12:25.310
from the vineyard, studying the
terroir, the soil, the climate,

00:12:25.310 --> 00:12:28.230
and the winery, we were the
first to bring to Argentina

00:12:28.230 --> 00:12:32.090
small French oak barriques,
and also the plant sources.

00:12:32.090 --> 00:12:35.130
So if you-- does anybody
have a little vineyard

00:12:35.130 --> 00:12:37.590
in their backyard here?

00:12:37.590 --> 00:12:38.140
There you go.

00:12:38.140 --> 00:12:40.860
So if you want to
plant your vineyard,

00:12:40.860 --> 00:12:43.580
you go to a vine nursery
and you buy some plants.

00:12:43.580 --> 00:12:46.620
And you ask for A quality
plants, B quality plants,

00:12:46.620 --> 00:12:47.640
C quality plants.

00:12:47.640 --> 00:12:50.580
A quality is small
production high quality.

00:12:50.580 --> 00:12:55.780
C quality is high yielding,
maybe not as interesting.

00:12:55.780 --> 00:12:57.760
So what my father
did is he started

00:12:57.760 --> 00:13:03.250
bringing some of these top
level, high quality, plant

00:13:03.250 --> 00:13:05.560
selections to Argentina
for the first time.

00:13:08.540 --> 00:13:10.770
And I'm going to explain
to you in a minute why

00:13:10.770 --> 00:13:13.360
I'm having a light
saber fight here.

00:13:13.360 --> 00:13:16.400
But first of all, I want to
talk about Jacques Luton who

00:13:16.400 --> 00:13:20.820
is Darth Vader here, who
was our French consultant.

00:13:20.820 --> 00:13:24.990
And has anybody had any of
the Luton wines from France?

00:13:24.990 --> 00:13:27.630
So has anybody had Chavel Blanc?

00:13:27.630 --> 00:13:29.790
So Chavel Blanc is
a very famous wine.

00:13:29.790 --> 00:13:33.270
And Jacques's cousin is the
winemaker at Chavel Blanc.

00:13:33.270 --> 00:13:35.900
And they're this very well
known Bourdeaux family

00:13:35.900 --> 00:13:37.380
that make wine.

00:13:37.380 --> 00:13:41.460
And my father, when I was
still at Harvard undergrad,

00:13:41.460 --> 00:13:45.030
invited me to go with him
to France as his translator.

00:13:45.030 --> 00:13:46.850
And we went to see Jacques.

00:13:46.850 --> 00:13:50.050
And we brought a bottle of
some Cabernet Sauvignon,

00:13:50.050 --> 00:13:54.250
this is in the late '80s,
of some Cabernet Sauvignon

00:13:54.250 --> 00:13:58.500
from one of the traditional
areas in Argentina in the east.

00:13:58.500 --> 00:14:00.109
And we brought this
bottle of wine.

00:14:00.109 --> 00:14:01.150
And we poured it for him.

00:14:01.150 --> 00:14:04.050
I remember we were in
this very fancy chateau.

00:14:04.050 --> 00:14:06.460
I was so impressed
by everything.

00:14:06.460 --> 00:14:09.382
And he said, Nicola [INAUDIBLE].

00:14:09.382 --> 00:14:11.930
This is a very nice
Cabernet Sauvignon.

00:14:11.930 --> 00:14:15.446
Like one from the [INAUDIBLE].

00:14:15.446 --> 00:14:18.700
And I heard this, and I thought
oh, that sounds wonderful.

00:14:18.700 --> 00:14:21.350
And then my father
was very serious.

00:14:21.350 --> 00:14:23.760
And I said, what's going on.

00:14:23.760 --> 00:14:26.190
And he said this is
the worst insult.

00:14:26.190 --> 00:14:28.010
This would be like
somebody saying

00:14:28.010 --> 00:14:29.950
this tastes like a
very nice Cabernet

00:14:29.950 --> 00:14:31.820
from the Central Valley.

00:14:31.820 --> 00:14:33.855
So anyhow, so we have
this opportunity.

00:14:33.855 --> 00:14:36.200
Jacques and I were
both invited to what

00:14:36.200 --> 00:14:39.580
was called the Jedi Tour
by our importer in Canada.

00:14:39.580 --> 00:14:40.920
And I said, let's have some fun.

00:14:40.920 --> 00:14:43.980
Let's have a light saber fight.

00:14:43.980 --> 00:14:46.000
And I said, but I
have to kill you

00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:49.940
at the end in revenge for
what you said to us, to my dad

00:14:49.940 --> 00:14:52.120
and I. Because now he
thinks we make great wine.

00:14:52.120 --> 00:14:55.560
But anyhow, the main concept
that came from Jacques

00:14:55.560 --> 00:14:57.985
was about cool climate.

00:14:57.985 --> 00:14:59.890
And this could have
been a death sentence.

00:14:59.890 --> 00:15:02.090
Because maybe we didn't
have any cool climate.

00:15:02.090 --> 00:15:04.520
But we were fortunate
that as you go up

00:15:04.520 --> 00:15:08.320
towards the mountains, it gets
colder and colder and colder.

00:15:08.320 --> 00:15:11.850
So we actually had a
location with cooler climate

00:15:11.850 --> 00:15:14.910
within our region.

00:15:14.910 --> 00:15:17.880
So this is my grandfather,
who I call Nonno.

00:15:17.880 --> 00:15:21.210
That's what you call your
grandfather in Italian.

00:15:21.210 --> 00:15:24.250
And the slide is
named Why Malbec?

00:15:24.250 --> 00:15:28.520
So my grandfather used to do to
France and Italy, and come back

00:15:28.520 --> 00:15:31.950
and say to my dad,
Nicolas, you're

00:15:31.950 --> 00:15:34.175
paying way too much attention
to Cabernet Sauvignon

00:15:34.175 --> 00:15:35.240
and chardonnay.

00:15:35.240 --> 00:15:37.610
The greatest variety
that we have is Malbec.

00:15:37.610 --> 00:15:39.660
And my father wasn't
sure, because most

00:15:39.660 --> 00:15:43.450
of the Malbecs he tasted back
then weren't that interesting.

00:15:43.450 --> 00:15:46.000
But then in the late '80s,
my grandfather passed away

00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:49.510
and my dad got a little
sentimental, said you know,

00:15:49.510 --> 00:15:50.820
I got to try this.

00:15:50.820 --> 00:15:52.330
It got to do this for my father.

00:15:52.330 --> 00:15:55.060
And the interesting thing
when I was working on my book,

00:15:55.060 --> 00:15:57.860
I did a lot of
research on Malbec.

00:15:57.860 --> 00:16:01.920
And actually, Malbec was one of
the most prestigious varieties

00:16:01.920 --> 00:16:05.040
in France in the Middle Ages
and in the 19th century.

00:16:05.040 --> 00:16:07.240
In the Middle Ages, it
was called the black wine.

00:16:07.240 --> 00:16:09.930
And actually it was drank
and the wedding of Eleanor

00:16:09.930 --> 00:16:12.690
of Acquitaine and also
is famous in the court

00:16:12.690 --> 00:16:14.760
of Peter the Great.

00:16:14.760 --> 00:16:19.520
And then in Bordeaux, in
the 19th century, 40 to 60%

00:16:19.520 --> 00:16:22.510
of the first growths,
all these famous wines,

00:16:22.510 --> 00:16:25.510
first, second, third growth,
the grand crus from France

00:16:25.510 --> 00:16:26.700
had Malbec in them.

00:16:26.700 --> 00:16:28.820
But the French don't
like to talk about it.

00:16:28.820 --> 00:16:31.010
Because now they replace
the Malbec with Merlot,

00:16:31.010 --> 00:16:33.910
so they don't want to
make the Malbec famous.

00:16:33.910 --> 00:16:38.480
But this was a variety with a
very good pedigree in quality

00:16:38.480 --> 00:16:39.480
and also in ageability.

00:16:42.460 --> 00:16:44.610
So this is the
Adrianna Vineyard,

00:16:44.610 --> 00:16:45.920
named after my sister.

00:16:45.920 --> 00:16:48.670
And so what my
father did at first

00:16:48.670 --> 00:16:51.610
was to study the
climate and the soil.

00:16:51.610 --> 00:16:54.040
And he put weather
stations all over Mendoza.

00:16:54.040 --> 00:16:57.130
This took about 10 years
to do all this research.

00:16:57.130 --> 00:16:59.440
And he found this
place in Gualtallary

00:16:59.440 --> 00:17:00.730
in a place called Tupungato.

00:17:00.730 --> 00:17:02.739
Have you heard of
the Uco Valley?

00:17:02.739 --> 00:17:04.780
So the Uco Valley is where
some very high quality

00:17:04.780 --> 00:17:05.960
wines come in Argentina.

00:17:05.960 --> 00:17:07.560
And this was a vineyard.

00:17:07.560 --> 00:17:10.319
Kelsey, your mother's
vineyard's in the Uco Valley.

00:17:10.319 --> 00:17:12.263
Yeah, we have somebody
with a vineyard

00:17:12.263 --> 00:17:14.960
in the family in the Uco valley.

00:17:14.960 --> 00:17:17.880
So he went to this place.

00:17:17.880 --> 00:17:20.150
He put these weather stations .

00:17:20.150 --> 00:17:23.410
And this place was
as cold as Burgundy.

00:17:23.410 --> 00:17:25.652
Has anybody here
been to Burgundy?

00:17:25.652 --> 00:17:26.910
A few people, yeah.

00:17:26.910 --> 00:17:30.590
So Burgundy, you would never
ever plant Malbec in Burgundy.

00:17:30.590 --> 00:17:32.520
Because Malbec is
a Bordeaux variety.

00:17:32.520 --> 00:17:33.890
And it would be too cold.

00:17:33.890 --> 00:17:36.110
But my father thought,
hey it's cold.

00:17:36.110 --> 00:17:37.680
But it's very sunny.

00:17:37.680 --> 00:17:40.570
So Malbec might ripen there.

00:17:40.570 --> 00:17:42.505
And it did.

00:17:42.505 --> 00:17:44.630
And you're going to get to
taste some of the Malbec

00:17:44.630 --> 00:17:46.587
from Adrianna.

00:17:46.587 --> 00:17:48.420
So he planted this
vineyard despite the fact

00:17:48.420 --> 00:17:50.460
that all his
viticulturalists said

00:17:50.460 --> 00:17:52.530
grapes will never ripen here.

00:17:52.530 --> 00:17:54.262
But they did.

00:17:54.262 --> 00:17:55.720
And then the next
thing that he had

00:17:55.720 --> 00:17:57.800
to work on what the
plant selection.

00:17:57.800 --> 00:18:00.520
Because you could go to the
divine nurseries in France

00:18:00.520 --> 00:18:04.040
and get fantastic cuttings
for Cabernet or chardonnay.

00:18:04.040 --> 00:18:06.090
But you couldn't get
good quality Malbec.

00:18:06.090 --> 00:18:07.630
So he went to our
oldest vineyard

00:18:07.630 --> 00:18:11.330
which is named Angelica
after my grandmother.

00:18:11.330 --> 00:18:15.330
And he made a selection
of 145 different plans.

00:18:15.330 --> 00:18:18.770
And one important thing
to know about vines

00:18:18.770 --> 00:18:20.440
is that although
in the wild, they

00:18:20.440 --> 00:18:22.780
would reproduce by
seeds, if you were

00:18:22.780 --> 00:18:26.330
to plant the seed of
a grape, of Cabernet,

00:18:26.330 --> 00:18:28.440
the new plant would
not be Cabernet.

00:18:28.440 --> 00:18:29.940
It would create a
different variety.

00:18:29.940 --> 00:18:32.560
So if you want to plant
a Cabernet vineyard,

00:18:32.560 --> 00:18:36.070
you actually use the
cuttings after pruning.

00:18:36.070 --> 00:18:39.160
And a cutting from
one plant will

00:18:39.160 --> 00:18:42.330
make another plant that's
exact to the mother plant.

00:18:42.330 --> 00:18:46.230
And so he made a selection of
145 plants and studied them.

00:18:46.230 --> 00:18:48.690
And then, we call these
the Catena cuttings,

00:18:48.690 --> 00:18:51.920
and we plant these cuttings
in all our vineyards.

00:18:51.920 --> 00:18:55.340
And this is just to
show you how different

00:18:55.340 --> 00:18:59.420
the grapes can be from
four different cuttings.

00:18:59.420 --> 00:19:01.670
So they're completely different.

00:19:01.670 --> 00:19:03.800
And they have completely
different flavors.

00:19:03.800 --> 00:19:04.870
But they are all Malbec.

00:19:07.970 --> 00:19:11.320
So this is my
mother, Elena Catena.

00:19:11.320 --> 00:19:16.890
So 10 years of research, we
now go from the early '80s

00:19:16.890 --> 00:19:20.680
to the late '80s, I
think it was about '91.

00:19:20.680 --> 00:19:24.050
And my father has made some
wines, Cabernet, chardonnay,

00:19:24.050 --> 00:19:27.670
Malbec, that the consultants,
people who come down

00:19:27.670 --> 00:19:31.620
to the winery say, wow, you've
hit a great level of quality.

00:19:31.620 --> 00:19:35.380
But he has a big problem, which
is that he's a total geek.

00:19:35.380 --> 00:19:39.940
And he likes to spend time
in a library or alone.

00:19:39.940 --> 00:19:43.380
There might be some of you
like that, but maybe not.

00:19:43.380 --> 00:19:47.350
And he realizes that he
is not the right person

00:19:47.350 --> 00:19:50.000
to go out to the world
and tell our story.

00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:52.000
And my mom was actually
running a high tech

00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:54.200
company in Argentina back then.

00:19:54.200 --> 00:19:56.840
And she went back actually to
running her high tech company.

00:19:56.840 --> 00:19:58.330
That's what she does now.

00:19:58.330 --> 00:20:02.330
But so my dad asked my mom
if she would go to the US

00:20:02.330 --> 00:20:03.940
and to Europe and
present our wines.

00:20:03.940 --> 00:20:06.580
And just to tell you a little
bit about my mom's personality,

00:20:06.580 --> 00:20:09.190
everybody in their
family has the parent

00:20:09.190 --> 00:20:11.360
that arrives early to the
airport and the one that

00:20:11.360 --> 00:20:13.390
arrives late, right.

00:20:13.390 --> 00:20:16.370
And so obviously my dad
arrives about five hours early,

00:20:16.370 --> 00:20:18.630
and my mom 30 minutes earlier.

00:20:18.630 --> 00:20:21.740
And so one time we were running
to the gate with my brother,

00:20:21.740 --> 00:20:24.180
my mother, and I. And
we get to the gate.

00:20:24.180 --> 00:20:25.960
And there is the pilot.

00:20:25.960 --> 00:20:28.370
And the plane is pulling off.

00:20:28.370 --> 00:20:31.880
And my mom drops to her
knees and starts praying.

00:20:31.880 --> 00:20:33.120
And the guy comes back.

00:20:33.120 --> 00:20:34.560
And we get on the plane.

00:20:34.560 --> 00:20:40.500
So my mom told me how this
went, her trip to the US.

00:20:40.500 --> 00:20:42.470
She said, Laurita,
that's what she calls me,

00:20:42.470 --> 00:20:44.930
I went to the store.

00:20:44.930 --> 00:20:46.350
I show them our wine.

00:20:46.350 --> 00:20:50.010
They said, I will not by an
Argentenian wine for $20.

00:20:50.010 --> 00:20:51.480
And I said, OK, Give me.

00:20:51.480 --> 00:20:53.610
What is your best
wine in the store?

00:20:53.610 --> 00:20:54.985
And they would pull some wine.

00:20:54.985 --> 00:20:55.610
I would buy it.

00:20:55.610 --> 00:20:57.026
I would say, let's
taste it blind.

00:20:57.026 --> 00:21:01.160
And we always won the
blind competition.

00:21:01.160 --> 00:21:04.430
So my mother sold
one bottle at a time.

00:21:04.430 --> 00:21:07.500
And we will always
be grateful to her,

00:21:07.500 --> 00:21:11.150
because I don't think that
anybody else in our family

00:21:11.150 --> 00:21:12.210
could have done this.

00:21:15.270 --> 00:21:18.960
So the New York Wine Experience.

00:21:18.960 --> 00:21:20.690
This is why I'm here today.

00:21:20.690 --> 00:21:23.770
Because I went to
medical school.

00:21:23.770 --> 00:21:27.500
I had absolutely no intention
of ever working for my family.

00:21:27.500 --> 00:21:29.059
But it was the '90s.

00:21:29.059 --> 00:21:30.850
I had just finished
med school at Stanford.

00:21:30.850 --> 00:21:33.770
I was doing my residency
in emergency medicine.

00:21:33.770 --> 00:21:35.570
And my dad called
me and said, we've

00:21:35.570 --> 00:21:37.660
been invited to this
very prestigious thing.

00:21:37.660 --> 00:21:40.270
Has anybody been to the
New York Wine Experience?

00:21:40.270 --> 00:21:41.130
Oh, you have been.

00:21:41.130 --> 00:21:41.720
Great.

00:21:41.720 --> 00:21:44.870
So the New York Wine Experience
is this amazing tasting

00:21:44.870 --> 00:21:47.770
where the Wine
Spectator invites some

00:21:47.770 --> 00:21:50.220
of the top winers of the world.

00:21:50.220 --> 00:21:51.290
It's kind of expensive.

00:21:51.290 --> 00:21:53.070
But you get to taste wines.

00:21:53.070 --> 00:21:55.430
Did you not think it was
incredible-- the wines?

00:21:55.430 --> 00:21:58.370
You get to taste wines that you
would never be able to taste.

00:21:58.370 --> 00:22:00.540
It would take you years to
go visit all those places

00:22:00.540 --> 00:22:02.440
and to get that kind of quality.

00:22:02.440 --> 00:22:05.720
You get old vintages from some
of the best wines in France,

00:22:05.720 --> 00:22:07.550
and Italy, and all
over the world.

00:22:07.550 --> 00:22:08.540
So we were invited.

00:22:08.540 --> 00:22:10.670
We were the first
Argentine winery

00:22:10.670 --> 00:22:13.000
to be invited to this tasting.

00:22:13.000 --> 00:22:15.650
And so I'm standing
in my little booth.

00:22:15.650 --> 00:22:18.000
And I'm watching these
big crowds standing

00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:21.310
behind the Italian, the
Californian, the French.

00:22:21.310 --> 00:22:23.970
And this is what it
looked like at my stand.

00:22:23.970 --> 00:22:26.080
So people and walk by.

00:22:26.080 --> 00:22:30.200
They'd kind of look over me
because I have heels now,

00:22:30.200 --> 00:22:31.800
but normally I'm pretty short.

00:22:31.800 --> 00:22:33.420
And so they would see Catena.

00:22:33.420 --> 00:22:34.482
They would see Argentina.

00:22:34.482 --> 00:22:35.940
And they would make
no eye contact.

00:22:35.940 --> 00:22:37.224
They'd keep on walking.

00:22:37.224 --> 00:22:39.890
And what really pissed me off is
that some people would actually

00:22:39.890 --> 00:22:43.560
spit at my spittoon
somebody else's wine.

00:22:43.560 --> 00:22:45.460
And then they'd move on.

00:22:45.460 --> 00:22:49.490
So I had very few people
coming to my stand.

00:22:49.490 --> 00:22:50.900
And it made me so angry.

00:22:50.900 --> 00:22:54.580
So the minute I got back to
California, I called my dad.

00:22:54.580 --> 00:22:55.884
And I said, I want in.

00:22:55.884 --> 00:22:57.050
I'm coming to work with you.

00:22:57.050 --> 00:22:57.870
I want to go to the winery.

00:22:57.870 --> 00:22:58.750
I want to go to the vineyards.

00:22:58.750 --> 00:23:00.380
I want to help you
sell the wines.

00:23:00.380 --> 00:23:02.940
Because I realized that
he needed some major help,

00:23:02.940 --> 00:23:06.900
that what he was trying
to do was so difficult.

00:23:06.900 --> 00:23:08.140
This is important.

00:23:08.140 --> 00:23:10.010
So I started
working with my dad.

00:23:10.010 --> 00:23:12.260
And I knew a lot
about wine tasting.

00:23:12.260 --> 00:23:13.530
And I tasted some great wines.

00:23:13.530 --> 00:23:16.560
But I knew very little
of the wine lingo.

00:23:16.560 --> 00:23:19.170
And I didn't really know which
varieties were from where.

00:23:19.170 --> 00:23:21.810
And this is actually one of
the first books that I read.

00:23:21.810 --> 00:23:24.100
And probably none of
you have read this book.

00:23:24.100 --> 00:23:25.260
But it's a great book.

00:23:25.260 --> 00:23:27.390
I highly recommend
it, especially

00:23:27.390 --> 00:23:30.150
if you've tasted a lot
but you kind of forget,

00:23:30.150 --> 00:23:31.780
oh what's the grape
from Piedmont?

00:23:31.780 --> 00:23:33.830
And what's the grape
from this place?

00:23:33.830 --> 00:23:34.660
You read this book.

00:23:34.660 --> 00:23:37.440
And you actually know
more than most winemakers

00:23:37.440 --> 00:23:39.760
about some of the
basics about wine.

00:23:39.760 --> 00:23:42.490
So I highly recommend it.

00:23:42.490 --> 00:23:48.260
So when I went back, I realized
that all these consultants

00:23:48.260 --> 00:23:51.420
were giving us advice
about how to make

00:23:51.420 --> 00:23:53.990
great wine in other
parts of the world.

00:23:53.990 --> 00:23:56.260
But our region was
completely different.

00:23:56.260 --> 00:24:00.550
There is no other region in the
world as high as our region.

00:24:00.550 --> 00:24:03.480
And also, they didn't know a
lot about Malbec wine making.

00:24:03.480 --> 00:24:06.200
In fact, most of us would
tell us to make Malbec the way

00:24:06.200 --> 00:24:07.410
you make Cabernet.

00:24:07.410 --> 00:24:10.490
And actually, you need to treat
Malbec totally differently.

00:24:10.490 --> 00:24:13.470
And they would also give
us advice like, you know,

00:24:13.470 --> 00:24:14.950
in order to remove
green flavors,

00:24:14.950 --> 00:24:17.170
you need to remove all
the leaves from the vines.

00:24:17.170 --> 00:24:19.750
And actually, if you remove all
the leaves at high altitude,

00:24:19.750 --> 00:24:22.980
there's so much sunlight that
you get burning of the grapes.

00:24:22.980 --> 00:24:24.730
And you get pruney flavors.

00:24:24.730 --> 00:24:25.964
And that's not what you want.

00:24:25.964 --> 00:24:27.630
So I realized that
we were going to have

00:24:27.630 --> 00:24:30.680
to do our own research if we
wanted to improve quality.

00:24:30.680 --> 00:24:33.620
And that's why I founded
the Catena Institute that

00:24:33.620 --> 00:24:36.350
does over 1,000
microvinifications per year.

00:24:36.350 --> 00:24:38.930
And we study everything
about our climate,

00:24:38.930 --> 00:24:40.800
high altitude, Malbec.

00:24:40.800 --> 00:24:43.540
And also we study new
varieties, new regions,

00:24:43.540 --> 00:24:47.310
sort of whatever
we think is fun.

00:24:47.310 --> 00:24:49.660
This is one of the
studies that we did.

00:24:49.660 --> 00:24:53.710
So this is the Angelica
vineyard at 2,700 elevation,

00:24:53.710 --> 00:24:55.900
La Piramide,
Adrianna, the vineyard

00:24:55.900 --> 00:24:58.930
you saw the picture of,
5,000 feet elevation.

00:24:58.930 --> 00:25:01.750
You can see the
temperature is a lot lower.

00:25:01.750 --> 00:25:04.860
You go from 15, average
15 Celsius, to 12.

00:25:04.860 --> 00:25:07.960
This in viticulture
is a huge difference.

00:25:07.960 --> 00:25:10.850
And the sun is a
lot more intense.

00:25:10.850 --> 00:25:13.430
And we found that these
grapes at high altitude,

00:25:13.430 --> 00:25:16.630
and these are all the same
plant selections of Malbec,

00:25:16.630 --> 00:25:19.790
had more than twice the amount
of tannins in the skins.

00:25:19.790 --> 00:25:23.690
And tannins are what give
you a flavor and ageability.

00:25:23.690 --> 00:25:28.740
So we found that there was a
very big impact from altitude

00:25:28.740 --> 00:25:34.185
on great quality and also on
the kind of flavors we got.

00:25:34.185 --> 00:25:35.810
And this is a group
of our researchers.

00:25:35.810 --> 00:25:39.080
They're measuring
photosynthesis in the plants.

00:25:39.080 --> 00:25:43.410
And I imagine you think that
wine research is, you just walk

00:25:43.410 --> 00:25:45.300
around with a glass
of wine and have fun.

00:25:45.300 --> 00:25:46.810
But actually, it's
pretty hard work.

00:25:46.810 --> 00:25:48.810
And there's a lot of sun.

00:25:48.810 --> 00:25:50.270
But it's still really fun.

00:25:52.860 --> 00:25:56.390
And this is a recent article
that we published about Malbec

00:25:56.390 --> 00:25:59.070
in "The American Journal of the
Viticulture and Technology."

00:25:59.070 --> 00:26:00.780
And this made me really proud.

00:26:00.780 --> 00:26:02.810
This professor at
Davis said that it

00:26:02.810 --> 00:26:06.430
was the largest of its
magnitude ever undertaken

00:26:06.430 --> 00:26:09.650
of a single variety in multiple
countries and hemispheres.

00:26:09.650 --> 00:26:12.240
And I was very proud
that our institute

00:26:12.240 --> 00:26:15.660
was able to publish in probably
the most reputable journal

00:26:15.660 --> 00:26:17.300
and our industry.

00:26:17.300 --> 00:26:18.950
And this research
was done by our head

00:26:18.950 --> 00:26:21.910
of research, Fernando Buscema.

00:26:21.910 --> 00:26:25.370
OK, so a little Argentina facts.

00:26:25.370 --> 00:26:27.300
So does anybody
know who this is?

00:26:31.170 --> 00:26:33.710
Messi, muy bien.

00:26:33.710 --> 00:26:35.600
Goal!

00:26:35.600 --> 00:26:36.100
OK.

00:26:36.100 --> 00:26:40.560
So Lionel Messi, four times
number one soccer player

00:26:40.560 --> 00:26:41.130
in the world.

00:26:41.130 --> 00:26:44.800
I was going to say futbol
but here it's soccer.

00:26:44.800 --> 00:26:48.190
So Lionel Messi.

00:26:48.190 --> 00:26:49.924
And then, OK.

00:26:49.924 --> 00:26:51.090
I'm telling you who that is.

00:26:51.090 --> 00:26:52.410
That's Manu Ginobili.

00:26:52.410 --> 00:26:54.380
Do you know who he plays for?

00:26:54.380 --> 00:26:55.930
It's on his t-shirt.

00:26:55.930 --> 00:26:57.130
The San Antonio Spurs.

00:26:57.130 --> 00:27:01.550
So one fun fact is
that Argentina-- and he

00:27:01.550 --> 00:27:06.670
was part of the team-- won the
Olympics in basketball in 2004.

00:27:06.670 --> 00:27:08.950
Did anybody know this?

00:27:08.950 --> 00:27:11.190
And they actually
beat the US team.

00:27:11.190 --> 00:27:12.840
But don't feel too
bad, because we

00:27:12.840 --> 00:27:14.510
took only two gold that year.

00:27:14.510 --> 00:27:15.620
And you guys took 36.

00:27:15.620 --> 00:27:20.670
And the US has a one the
basketball Olympics, men's 14

00:27:20.670 --> 00:27:21.850
times and the women's seven.

00:27:21.850 --> 00:27:22.974
And we've only won it once.

00:27:22.974 --> 00:27:25.750
But I thought I'd share
this fun fact, because I'm

00:27:25.750 --> 00:27:27.760
really proud of these
two guys because they

00:27:27.760 --> 00:27:29.490
are at the top of their game.

00:27:29.490 --> 00:27:31.470
And they're trying
to do in their field

00:27:31.470 --> 00:27:33.100
the same thing that we're doing.

00:27:33.100 --> 00:27:36.590
And it's very cool
that they're Argentine.

00:27:36.590 --> 00:27:40.330
And I think that they both drink
Catena wines, I've been told.

00:27:40.330 --> 00:27:43.290
So that's another
plus for them too.

00:27:43.290 --> 00:27:45.390
This is a map of our
Adrianna vineyard.

00:27:45.390 --> 00:27:48.130
And it would probably take
me about an hour or two

00:27:48.130 --> 00:27:50.410
to explain this map.

00:27:50.410 --> 00:27:52.050
But I want to tell you a story.

00:27:52.050 --> 00:27:55.790
About 15 years ago, I was
at the Adrianna vineyard

00:27:55.790 --> 00:27:58.150
up there, almost
5,000 feet elevation.

00:27:58.150 --> 00:28:01.124
And I was talking to the
viticulturist in charge.

00:28:01.124 --> 00:28:03.540
And I was seeing that there
was some areas of the vineyard

00:28:03.540 --> 00:28:05.373
that some browning that
didn't look so good.

00:28:05.373 --> 00:28:10.530
And I said, hey, what can we do
in these parts of the vineyard,

00:28:10.530 --> 00:28:14.024
because this is the vineyard
are we getting our best quality.

00:28:14.024 --> 00:28:16.440
And he said, you should take
a bulldozer to this vineyard.

00:28:16.440 --> 00:28:18.430
You should take
all the vines out.

00:28:18.430 --> 00:28:21.010
You should take all the
topsoil, mix it all up,

00:28:21.010 --> 00:28:22.140
and put it back on.

00:28:22.140 --> 00:28:25.040
Because there's too much
diversity in this vineyard.

00:28:25.040 --> 00:28:28.130
And this really pissed
me off obviously,

00:28:28.130 --> 00:28:30.720
because I'm thinking this
is our best vineyard.

00:28:30.720 --> 00:28:32.050
What are you talking about?

00:28:32.050 --> 00:28:34.580
But I kind of realized
talking to him

00:28:34.580 --> 00:28:37.230
that we needed to go a lot
more micro in this vineyard,

00:28:37.230 --> 00:28:39.950
that we needed to separate lots
and treat them all differently.

00:28:39.950 --> 00:28:42.320
Not only in the vineyard,
but then in the winery.

00:28:42.320 --> 00:28:46.430
And based on that, we actually
changed our whole approach

00:28:46.430 --> 00:28:50.630
to dividing our vineyards and
harvesting at different times.

00:28:50.630 --> 00:28:53.740
And this vineyard actually
this recent harvest

00:28:53.740 --> 00:28:57.020
was harvested in
137 different lots.

00:28:57.020 --> 00:28:59.120
There were all
harvested separately.

00:28:59.120 --> 00:29:02.800
Each lot was treated separately
and vinified separately.

00:29:02.800 --> 00:29:06.340
So that's why you see so many
marks and things on this map.

00:29:06.340 --> 00:29:10.260
And although this viticulturist
is no longer with us,

00:29:10.260 --> 00:29:12.310
I'm actually-- I
always remember him,

00:29:12.310 --> 00:29:15.870
because he taught me something.

00:29:15.870 --> 00:29:17.700
And this is just for you to see.

00:29:17.700 --> 00:29:20.750
You could have these three
completely different kinds

00:29:20.750 --> 00:29:23.690
of soils within this space.

00:29:23.690 --> 00:29:26.950
These are calcareous soils.

00:29:26.950 --> 00:29:29.080
They're also called
limestone soils.

00:29:29.080 --> 00:29:30.950
You might have heard
in Burgundy they

00:29:30.950 --> 00:29:32.402
have a lot of limestone soils.

00:29:32.402 --> 00:29:34.110
And they're considered
very high quality.

00:29:34.110 --> 00:29:36.340
We also like them
very much for Malbec.

00:29:36.340 --> 00:29:39.010
This is a deep soil that
has a little bit of clay,

00:29:39.010 --> 00:29:42.340
retains a little more
moisture, maybe a little better

00:29:42.340 --> 00:29:45.360
for Cabernet which does
not like too much stress.

00:29:45.360 --> 00:29:49.730
And this is a stony soil, which
we love for Malbec, because it

00:29:49.730 --> 00:29:52.990
has excellent drainage and it
actually stresses the vine.

00:29:52.990 --> 00:29:56.580
And Malbec does very well
with a little bit of stress.

00:29:56.580 --> 00:30:00.010
We get great
quality with stress.

00:30:00.010 --> 00:30:03.050
So this is our winemaker,
Alejandro Vigil.

00:30:03.050 --> 00:30:05.320
And I love this guy.

00:30:05.320 --> 00:30:07.320
He's been working
with us since 2002,

00:30:07.320 --> 00:30:10.290
because he is, to me
the winemaker that I've

00:30:10.290 --> 00:30:14.710
met that best mixes the art
and the science of wine making.

00:30:14.710 --> 00:30:16.540
And we actually
hired him when he

00:30:16.540 --> 00:30:18.380
was the head of
the soils division

00:30:18.380 --> 00:30:19.950
at the local
agriculture institute.

00:30:19.950 --> 00:30:21.770
And he first came in research.

00:30:21.770 --> 00:30:24.460
But then I realized that he
had such an amazing palette

00:30:24.460 --> 00:30:26.360
that he became our
head winemaker.

00:30:26.360 --> 00:30:28.590
And he and I love
to taste together.

00:30:28.590 --> 00:30:34.190
And watching him taste,
what I realize every time

00:30:34.190 --> 00:30:37.640
is that there is no
chemical measurement that

00:30:37.640 --> 00:30:40.530
can be better than
a good tongue.

00:30:40.530 --> 00:30:44.444
Because if you measure acidity,
if you measure alcohol,

00:30:44.444 --> 00:30:46.610
you can measure tannins,
there's all kinds of things

00:30:46.610 --> 00:30:48.210
that you can measure.

00:30:48.210 --> 00:30:52.470
But a good taster will
give you better information

00:30:52.470 --> 00:30:56.197
about the quality of a wine that
any kind of chemical analysis.

00:30:56.197 --> 00:30:58.280
And that's why I love
working with him, because he

00:30:58.280 --> 00:30:59.654
has such an
extraordinary palate.

00:30:59.654 --> 00:31:02.360
And this is a
tattoo that he has.

00:31:02.360 --> 00:31:04.850
And I love the story
about this tattoo.

00:31:04.850 --> 00:31:07.670
He was at a tasting in Brazil.

00:31:07.670 --> 00:31:09.830
And he had been invited
to this collector's house.

00:31:09.830 --> 00:31:10.110
Oh, yeah.

00:31:10.110 --> 00:31:10.940
You're the Brazil guy.

00:31:10.940 --> 00:31:11.440
Yeah.

00:31:11.440 --> 00:31:13.880
OK, so he was invited
to this tasting.

00:31:13.880 --> 00:31:16.720
And this guy was opening one
amazing bottle after another.

00:31:16.720 --> 00:31:18.220
And then the next
thing he remembers

00:31:18.220 --> 00:31:20.460
is he's in his
hotel room sleeping.

00:31:20.460 --> 00:31:21.410
He wakes up.

00:31:21.410 --> 00:31:23.025
And he's got this tattoo.

00:31:23.025 --> 00:31:24.250
It says Malbec.

00:31:24.250 --> 00:31:27.980
And fortunately, Juan
Cruz and not Rosita,

00:31:27.980 --> 00:31:30.010
because Juan Cruz is his son.

00:31:30.010 --> 00:31:32.510
So that was OK with
his wife, Maria.

00:31:32.510 --> 00:31:36.760
But I love the story
about the tattoo.

00:31:36.760 --> 00:31:40.850
So here we are,
aspiring to make wines

00:31:40.850 --> 00:31:43.250
that can stand with
the best of the world.

00:31:43.250 --> 00:31:47.210
And with the 1997 vintage of
the Nicolas Catena Zapata.

00:31:47.210 --> 00:31:50.232
And that's a wine that
I named after my father.

00:31:50.232 --> 00:31:51.190
It's a Cabernet Malbec.

00:31:51.190 --> 00:31:53.990
That that's his favorite blend.

00:31:53.990 --> 00:31:55.130
I thought we were ready.

00:31:55.130 --> 00:31:57.470
And my father agreed, although
he kept on backing off,

00:31:57.470 --> 00:32:00.460
that we were ready to do blind
tastings around the world,

00:32:00.460 --> 00:32:02.220
comparing our wines to others.

00:32:02.220 --> 00:32:05.580
And this is actually a tasting
that was published online.

00:32:05.580 --> 00:32:11.590
We did this tasting in
London and look at the date.

00:32:11.590 --> 00:32:13.512
So it was September 10, 2001.

00:32:13.512 --> 00:32:14.970
So actually, none
of our winemakers

00:32:14.970 --> 00:32:17.230
could get back home
back after the tasting.

00:32:17.230 --> 00:32:20.870
But we did this tasting where we
compared to Latour, [INAUDIBLE]

00:32:20.870 --> 00:32:23.230
Caymus special
selection, Opus One.

00:32:23.230 --> 00:32:25.070
And we were mostly
hoping that we

00:32:25.070 --> 00:32:27.400
wouldn't be last in the tasting.

00:32:27.400 --> 00:32:28.980
But we actually came in first.

00:32:28.980 --> 00:32:30.922
And people like
Jancis Robinson--

00:32:30.922 --> 00:32:32.630
does anybody know who
Jancis Robinson is?

00:32:32.630 --> 00:32:35.480
She's probably the most
famous female wine person.

00:32:35.480 --> 00:32:37.970
She organized the tasting.

00:32:37.970 --> 00:32:40.380
And there were many other
very good palates from England

00:32:40.380 --> 00:32:40.910
there.

00:32:40.910 --> 00:32:42.097
And we came in first.

00:32:42.097 --> 00:32:43.430
There were three small tastings.

00:32:43.430 --> 00:32:44.767
We came in first.

00:32:44.767 --> 00:32:46.350
And the interesting
thing is that they

00:32:46.350 --> 00:32:48.810
were supposed to write
which wine they thought

00:32:48.810 --> 00:32:50.820
was which wine.

00:32:50.820 --> 00:32:53.480
And nobody guessed that
our wine was our wine.

00:32:53.480 --> 00:32:57.250
Because they could not imagine
that a wine from Argentina

00:32:57.250 --> 00:32:58.500
would be that good.

00:32:58.500 --> 00:33:00.280
And that was in 2001.

00:33:00.280 --> 00:33:06.050
And this is a little review that
Robert Parker's "Wine Advocate"

00:33:06.050 --> 00:33:07.480
that our importer prepared.

00:33:07.480 --> 00:33:10.250
And it was basically
comparing average ratings

00:33:10.250 --> 00:33:13.100
from 2004 to 2009.

00:33:13.100 --> 00:33:15.500
These are some of
the top rated wines.

00:33:15.500 --> 00:33:20.870
And Romanee-Conti, I've only
had it once, it's about $10,000

00:33:20.870 --> 00:33:21.970
plus a bottle.

00:33:21.970 --> 00:33:23.840
Has anybody here had it?

00:33:23.840 --> 00:33:24.340
OK.

00:33:24.340 --> 00:33:28.010
So you have to find some rich
person to share it with you.

00:33:28.010 --> 00:33:31.060
That's-- or like my winemaker.

00:33:31.060 --> 00:33:32.920
Go to some collector's house.

00:33:32.920 --> 00:33:34.460
So we're right after.

00:33:34.460 --> 00:33:37.210
And then you might know some of
these wines-- Harlan, Shafer,

00:33:37.210 --> 00:33:40.320
Hillside Select,
Gaia, Chateaubriand.

00:33:40.320 --> 00:33:42.480
So these are amazing reviews.

00:33:42.480 --> 00:33:45.460
But the reality is
that people still

00:33:45.460 --> 00:33:48.330
don't know about
the kind of quality

00:33:48.330 --> 00:33:49.810
we can get in Argentina.

00:33:49.810 --> 00:33:54.150
So I need you guys, all of
you here, to taste these wines

00:33:54.150 --> 00:33:55.290
and talk about them.

00:33:55.290 --> 00:33:58.910
Because we still have a lot of
work to do for our whole region

00:33:58.910 --> 00:34:01.160
to show the kind of
quality we can make.

00:34:03.730 --> 00:34:06.560
And this is Chateau Lafite.

00:34:06.560 --> 00:34:09.239
And in 1998, the owners
of Chateau Lafite,

00:34:09.239 --> 00:34:12.350
Eric de Rothschild, came to
our cantina, tasted our wines,

00:34:12.350 --> 00:34:15.440
fell in love with our
Malbec and our Cabernet.

00:34:15.440 --> 00:34:18.380
And we formed a partnership
with them that is called Caro.

00:34:18.380 --> 00:34:20.780
Has anybody had this wine.

00:34:20.780 --> 00:34:23.159
So it's a really--- oh, Shannon.

00:34:23.159 --> 00:34:24.250
Very good.

00:34:24.250 --> 00:34:26.880
So it's a great wine. it
also ages beautifully.

00:34:26.880 --> 00:34:29.290
And the best thing
is that when I

00:34:29.290 --> 00:34:32.360
go to Vinexpo, which
is the big wine fair.

00:34:32.360 --> 00:34:33.400
Have you been?

00:34:33.400 --> 00:34:34.100
Anybody?

00:34:34.100 --> 00:34:35.889
So it's actually pretty boring.

00:34:35.889 --> 00:34:36.770
Don't go to that.

00:34:36.770 --> 00:34:39.350
But the New York Wine
Experience is worth it.

00:34:39.350 --> 00:34:41.850
But anyhow, I get
to-- that's my hotel.

00:34:41.850 --> 00:34:44.580
So that makes the
whole project worth it.

00:34:44.580 --> 00:34:46.780
It's pretty fun.

00:34:46.780 --> 00:34:49.030
So this is my father
when he received

00:34:49.030 --> 00:34:51.429
the Decanter Man
of the Year Award.

00:34:51.429 --> 00:34:56.679
And this award is kind of
like the lifetime achievement

00:34:56.679 --> 00:34:58.980
that they give to
actors at the Oscars.

00:34:58.980 --> 00:35:01.710
And he's also received a similar
award, Distinguished Service

00:35:01.710 --> 00:35:04.070
Award in 2012, from
Wine Spectator.

00:35:04.070 --> 00:35:08.610
He's received awards from Wine
Enthusiast, Der Feinschmecker.

00:35:08.610 --> 00:35:11.110
And this'll be the
equivalent of standing

00:35:11.110 --> 00:35:15.110
next to Sergey Brin, Larry
Page, Steve Jobs-- what's

00:35:15.110 --> 00:35:19.340
the Tesla guy-- Elon
Musk, Mark Zuckerberg.

00:35:19.340 --> 00:35:23.960
Although they'd be a lot
younger and no women.

00:35:23.960 --> 00:35:25.400
I almost didn't
want to show this.

00:35:25.400 --> 00:35:29.740
But next time we'll
get women on the slide.

00:35:29.740 --> 00:35:34.150
But this is a big deal for us,
for a winery, for my father,

00:35:34.150 --> 00:35:35.680
to receive this award.

00:35:35.680 --> 00:35:38.900
And a really fun
thing was in 2013

00:35:38.900 --> 00:35:42.170
when he went to receive this
award at Wine Spectator,

00:35:42.170 --> 00:35:45.650
we went back and we had
long lines on our booth.

00:35:45.650 --> 00:35:47.760
And then actually
at the gala event

00:35:47.760 --> 00:35:49.540
where they give
the awards, we were

00:35:49.540 --> 00:35:52.340
sitting at the head table with
Francis Ford Coppola and Angelo

00:35:52.340 --> 00:35:53.240
Gaja.

00:35:53.240 --> 00:35:56.610
And I was saying to my
dad, 20 years ago-- I mean,

00:35:56.610 --> 00:35:59.110
there is no way I
would have predicted

00:35:59.110 --> 00:36:00.450
sitting on this table.

00:36:00.450 --> 00:36:02.800
We almost felt like
cheats or fakes,

00:36:02.800 --> 00:36:05.039
that we were actually sitting
in that table with all

00:36:05.039 --> 00:36:05.580
these people.

00:36:05.580 --> 00:36:08.180
Because we would have
never pictured being there

00:36:08.180 --> 00:36:10.100
or getting there.

00:36:10.100 --> 00:36:12.910
So this book, "Vino
Argentino," and the reason I

00:36:12.910 --> 00:36:14.510
wrote this book
was because I got

00:36:14.510 --> 00:36:16.755
tired of going to taste
things and I'd ask people,

00:36:16.755 --> 00:36:19.440
well when do you think
Argentina started making wine?

00:36:19.440 --> 00:36:21.230
And they'd say 20 years ago.

00:36:21.230 --> 00:36:22.910
And we've been making
wine in Argentina

00:36:22.910 --> 00:36:24.600
since the 16th century.

00:36:24.600 --> 00:36:26.790
We are the fifth largest
of wine in the world.

00:36:26.790 --> 00:36:29.330
We have all these Italian
and Spanish immigrants

00:36:29.330 --> 00:36:31.030
that came to Argentina.

00:36:31.030 --> 00:36:33.510
We drink wine the way
the Italians, the French,

00:36:33.510 --> 00:36:34.850
the Spanish, now the Americans.

00:36:34.850 --> 00:36:38.750
Actually, America keeps on
moving up in wine consumption.

00:36:38.750 --> 00:36:40.570
So this book has a
lot of information

00:36:40.570 --> 00:36:41.880
about the wine country.

00:36:41.880 --> 00:36:42.960
There are some recipes.

00:36:42.960 --> 00:36:44.750
It also has a chapter
on Buenos Aires,

00:36:44.750 --> 00:36:46.430
which restaurants to go to.

00:36:46.430 --> 00:36:47.590
So I hope that you get it.

00:36:47.590 --> 00:36:50.150
And you have a really
cheap price, by the way.

00:36:50.150 --> 00:36:52.390
Because it's normally
sold for $25.

00:36:52.390 --> 00:36:54.472
And apparently there's
a Google discount.

00:36:54.472 --> 00:36:55.430
And you get it for $10.

00:36:55.430 --> 00:36:59.380
I-- actually, my author
copies cost me $11.

00:36:59.380 --> 00:37:03.120
So you have a really good deal.

00:37:03.120 --> 00:37:07.960
So just to review the principles
that we live by at Catena.

00:37:07.960 --> 00:37:09.520
Compete with the best.

00:37:09.520 --> 00:37:11.550
We always aspire
to make wines that

00:37:11.550 --> 00:37:15.250
stand with the
best of the world.

00:37:15.250 --> 00:37:17.220
The academic-- if you
don't know something,

00:37:17.220 --> 00:37:20.367
study it, research it, be
humble about what you know

00:37:20.367 --> 00:37:22.700
and what you don't know.

00:37:22.700 --> 00:37:24.460
Believe and make others believe.

00:37:24.460 --> 00:37:26.320
Sometimes I'll tell
people at the winery,

00:37:26.320 --> 00:37:29.160
find the Elena
Cartena in you, when

00:37:29.160 --> 00:37:31.280
I think they need some guts.

00:37:31.280 --> 00:37:32.780
And home is where the heart is.

00:37:32.780 --> 00:37:35.460
That's a little more
of a personal note.

00:37:35.460 --> 00:37:38.940
When I studied medicine,
I had this idea

00:37:38.940 --> 00:37:40.699
that business people
were bad, that I

00:37:40.699 --> 00:37:42.740
was going to be a doctor
because that was the way

00:37:42.740 --> 00:37:43.740
to help people.

00:37:43.740 --> 00:37:46.150
And sorry, because you
work for a business.

00:37:46.150 --> 00:37:47.690
But I changed my mind.

00:37:47.690 --> 00:37:50.000
And once I started
working with my dad

00:37:50.000 --> 00:37:53.050
and I saw how the rural
communities were changing

00:37:53.050 --> 00:37:57.530
because of wine, how people
now had gardens and had better

00:37:57.530 --> 00:37:59.090
schools and had more wealth.

00:37:59.090 --> 00:38:01.870
And also watching the people
I work, our winemakers,

00:38:01.870 --> 00:38:04.840
who are so inspired
by our daily work

00:38:04.840 --> 00:38:07.260
to make these great
Argentine wines,

00:38:07.260 --> 00:38:08.850
I actually came
to the realization

00:38:08.850 --> 00:38:12.050
that I have a much bigger
impact on the world

00:38:12.050 --> 00:38:13.320
through my wine region.

00:38:13.320 --> 00:38:15.330
And actually, the
work my father has

00:38:15.330 --> 00:38:17.260
done in promoting the
whole region, not just

00:38:17.260 --> 00:38:21.600
our own winery, that is probably
a lot more significant in terms

00:38:21.600 --> 00:38:25.280
of a contribution that
what I do as a physician.

00:38:25.280 --> 00:38:27.470
And so I have kind
of full circle

00:38:27.470 --> 00:38:29.870
changed my mind
about how one can

00:38:29.870 --> 00:38:33.620
make a contribution
to this world.

00:38:33.620 --> 00:38:36.720
And this is just some of the
work that our foundation does.

00:38:36.720 --> 00:38:40.460
It's named after-- that's
my grandmother, Angelica.

00:38:40.460 --> 00:38:42.430
We support some of
the-- we're almost done,

00:38:42.430 --> 00:38:44.030
guys-- three more slides.

00:38:44.030 --> 00:38:50.040
We support some of the local
schools, some of the trade

00:38:50.040 --> 00:38:51.800
schools, because
we feel it's very

00:38:51.800 --> 00:38:53.810
important for the
traditional trades

00:38:53.810 --> 00:38:56.170
to be maintained
in the countryside.

00:38:56.170 --> 00:38:59.790
This is our head of research who
we sponsored to go to UC Davis

00:38:59.790 --> 00:39:01.310
to study.

00:39:01.310 --> 00:39:03.090
And this is our pyramid.

00:39:03.090 --> 00:39:04.930
And the last slide.

00:39:04.930 --> 00:39:07.980
So why we have a pyramid
on all our labels--

00:39:07.980 --> 00:39:11.020
when my father was moving
the vineyards to the higher

00:39:11.020 --> 00:39:14.040
altitude, he wanted to find
an architectural style that

00:39:14.040 --> 00:39:16.190
would symbolize South America.

00:39:16.190 --> 00:39:19.520
And so he didn't want to
make an Italian, or French,

00:39:19.520 --> 00:39:21.470
or a Spanish style building.

00:39:21.470 --> 00:39:23.630
And he was inspired
by the Mayans, who

00:39:23.630 --> 00:39:26.100
were the most advanced
civilization of the Americas

00:39:26.100 --> 00:39:30.840
in terms of astronomy, and
language, and mathematics.

00:39:30.840 --> 00:39:36.670
And so he designed the winery in
the shape of the Mayan pyramid.

00:39:36.670 --> 00:39:39.100
So thank you very much.

00:39:39.100 --> 00:39:40.150
Any questions?

00:39:40.150 --> 00:39:40.650
OK.

00:39:40.650 --> 00:39:42.630
Well, thank you.

00:39:42.630 --> 00:39:46.590
[APPLAUSE]

00:39:46.590 --> 00:39:48.250
AUDIENCE: It might
be a basic question.

00:39:48.250 --> 00:39:51.675
But I'm a very big fan of
Carmeneres and Malbecs.

00:39:51.675 --> 00:39:53.620
Why Carmenere never
makes to Argentina,

00:39:53.620 --> 00:39:55.930
Malbecs never make to Chile?

00:39:55.930 --> 00:39:57.790
LAURA CATENA: That's
a very good question.

00:39:57.790 --> 00:40:01.020
Well, Malbec-- actually,
I don't know the answer

00:40:01.020 --> 00:40:03.760
to the question of why they
were brought initially.

00:40:03.760 --> 00:40:07.440
So Malbec was brought
to Argentina in 1852.

00:40:07.440 --> 00:40:10.600
And it came with many
of the French varieties.

00:40:10.600 --> 00:40:13.550
And actually, nobody
knows why Malbec

00:40:13.550 --> 00:40:15.960
became the most important
variety in Argentina.

00:40:15.960 --> 00:40:19.910
My theory is that it adapted
so well to the climate.

00:40:19.910 --> 00:40:23.570
And I still think that Malbec
and Mendoza especially,

00:40:23.570 --> 00:40:26.070
are such a great
combination, because Malbec

00:40:26.070 --> 00:40:28.480
likes the sunlight, it
likes the kind of soils,

00:40:28.480 --> 00:40:31.550
that I think that people
saw that it gave great wine.

00:40:31.550 --> 00:40:33.470
And that's why they
kept on replanting it.

00:40:33.470 --> 00:40:36.510
And if you actually think of the
climate of Argentina and Chile,

00:40:36.510 --> 00:40:38.590
they are more different
than the climate

00:40:38.590 --> 00:40:40.440
of Burgundy and Bordeaux.

00:40:40.440 --> 00:40:42.460
Because we have these mountains.

00:40:42.460 --> 00:40:46.110
And we have this high
altitude, semi-desert.

00:40:46.110 --> 00:40:48.010
And they have the
ocean influence.

00:40:48.010 --> 00:40:49.270
And they're much lower.

00:40:49.270 --> 00:40:51.690
So actually, the
soil and the climate

00:40:51.690 --> 00:40:53.830
are so different
that you would not

00:40:53.830 --> 00:40:57.026
expect the same varieties to
do well in both countries.

00:40:57.026 --> 00:40:58.400
So I think probably
what happened

00:40:58.400 --> 00:41:01.210
is Carmenere did well there and
Malbec did well in Argentina.

00:41:01.210 --> 00:41:03.340
And then that became
a historic fact.

00:41:03.340 --> 00:41:04.280
But that's my theory.

00:41:04.280 --> 00:41:08.390
I don't actually know
the for sure answer.

00:41:08.390 --> 00:41:11.340
But great question-- I've
never been asked that before.

00:41:11.340 --> 00:41:12.340
Yeah.

00:41:12.340 --> 00:41:14.840
AUDIENCE: Do you have to make
reservations so far in advance

00:41:14.840 --> 00:41:16.381
when you're in
Argentina than in Napa

00:41:16.381 --> 00:41:17.892
and Chile and other places?

00:41:17.892 --> 00:41:18.600
LAURA CATENA: OK.

00:41:18.600 --> 00:41:22.340
So the question is why is the
reservation system so formal

00:41:22.340 --> 00:41:25.680
in Argentina, and you have
to make reservations so far

00:41:25.680 --> 00:41:26.986
in advance?

00:41:26.986 --> 00:41:29.360
Did you have a hard time making
reservation at my winery?

00:41:29.360 --> 00:41:29.957
AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:41:29.957 --> 00:41:31.290
LAURA CATENA: You didn't get in?

00:41:31.290 --> 00:41:32.830
You know, I'll
tell you one story.

00:41:32.830 --> 00:41:35.400
I once got in a
taxi in Argentina.

00:41:35.400 --> 00:41:36.360
And I asked the guy.

00:41:36.360 --> 00:41:37.420
He didn't know who I was.

00:41:37.420 --> 00:41:41.160
I said, where do you
take people wine tasting?

00:41:41.160 --> 00:41:43.655
And he says, oh this
winery, that winery.

00:41:43.655 --> 00:41:45.130
He's not mentioning my winery.

00:41:45.130 --> 00:41:47.430
So I said, what
about Catena Zapata.

00:41:47.430 --> 00:41:49.100
He said, oh I never
take them there.

00:41:49.100 --> 00:41:51.490
It's impossible to get
an appointment there.

00:41:51.490 --> 00:41:53.350
And so I go back to my guy.

00:41:53.350 --> 00:41:55.300
And I say, open up more spots.

00:41:55.300 --> 00:41:59.741
And actually we maximize
how many spots we have.

00:41:59.741 --> 00:42:01.490
But I think what happens
is that everybody

00:42:01.490 --> 00:42:03.420
goes at the same time.

00:42:03.420 --> 00:42:09.200
So if you go during the peak,
Thanksgiving, Christmas,

00:42:09.200 --> 00:42:10.107
the holidays here.

00:42:10.107 --> 00:42:11.190
I don't know, when you go?

00:42:11.190 --> 00:42:12.600
What time-- Christmas.

00:42:12.600 --> 00:42:14.560
So what ends up-- first
of, all Argentines

00:42:14.560 --> 00:42:16.440
don't like to work at Christmas.

00:42:16.440 --> 00:42:18.330
So that might have
been a problem.

00:42:18.330 --> 00:42:20.530
But even if you
go that week, they

00:42:20.530 --> 00:42:23.938
get booked up so, so early.

00:42:23.938 --> 00:42:25.930
Yeah, it is a problem.

00:42:25.930 --> 00:42:27.850
Maybe there's not
enough wineries,

00:42:27.850 --> 00:42:30.240
although there's
over 1,000 wineries.

00:42:30.240 --> 00:42:33.390
But give me your name--
next time-- wait.

00:42:33.390 --> 00:42:36.020
Anybody here, I have
this rule that anybody

00:42:36.020 --> 00:42:38.560
who comes to my talk is VIP.

00:42:38.560 --> 00:42:40.880
Especially somebody
who reads my book.

00:42:40.880 --> 00:42:44.780
So if it's signed by me,
it's even more of a plus.

00:42:44.780 --> 00:42:45.920
So you write to the winery.

00:42:45.920 --> 00:42:47.850
And you say that
you met me, and I

00:42:47.850 --> 00:42:49.500
said that you should get a tour.

00:42:49.500 --> 00:42:52.521
And my email-- well, my email.

00:42:52.521 --> 00:42:53.520
It's licatena@gmail.com.

00:42:56.144 --> 00:42:57.060
You can write it down.

00:42:57.060 --> 00:42:58.789
Or just say that I
gave you my email

00:42:58.789 --> 00:43:00.580
and you lost it if you
can't write it down.

00:43:00.580 --> 00:43:01.970
And you will get a tour.

00:43:01.970 --> 00:43:02.470
OK.

00:43:02.470 --> 00:43:04.840
So you just have to say that you
met me and you'll get a tour.

00:43:04.840 --> 00:43:06.260
But I'm sorry that
that happened to you.

00:43:06.260 --> 00:43:07.470
That's really sad for me.

00:43:07.470 --> 00:43:08.590
I'm serious.

00:43:08.590 --> 00:43:10.710
I hate it when
people tell me that.

00:43:10.710 --> 00:43:13.050
Any other questions?

00:43:13.050 --> 00:43:15.440
AUDIENCE: I was curious how
you feel about your winery's

00:43:15.440 --> 00:43:18.230
interaction with say Wine
Spectator or other critics who

00:43:18.230 --> 00:43:21.489
seem to fairly carefully control
who is successful and was not?

00:43:21.489 --> 00:43:22.280
LAURA CATENA: Yeah.

00:43:22.280 --> 00:43:25.930
So this is a big question in
wine about the wine critics.

00:43:25.930 --> 00:43:28.190
And some people think
they have too much power.

00:43:28.190 --> 00:43:31.540
Some people criticize
their kind of palates.

00:43:31.540 --> 00:43:34.180
Some other people think
you can buy ratings.

00:43:34.180 --> 00:43:37.670
Well, I can tell you for sure
that if you could buy ratings,

00:43:37.670 --> 00:43:39.850
I would have been the first
one to try to buy one.

00:43:39.850 --> 00:43:42.010
Sorry, but you can't.

00:43:42.010 --> 00:43:43.030
You can't buy ratings.

00:43:43.030 --> 00:43:44.300
You send your wines.

00:43:44.300 --> 00:43:45.510
They taste them blind.

00:43:45.510 --> 00:43:48.570
And I know people that
work at these magazines.

00:43:48.570 --> 00:43:51.260
And they said it is
completely blind.

00:43:51.260 --> 00:43:58.271
So it's-- I don't know why some
wines get rated higher than

00:43:58.271 --> 00:43:58.770
others.

00:43:58.770 --> 00:44:00.050
Hopefully it's the quality.

00:44:00.050 --> 00:44:03.950
I do think that some reviewers
have certain palates.

00:44:03.950 --> 00:44:06.460
And so you might do better
with a certain style.

00:44:06.460 --> 00:44:09.440
But I don't think, like many
people say Robert Parker likes

00:44:09.440 --> 00:44:11.230
huge oaky wines,
and I've actually

00:44:11.230 --> 00:44:13.290
seen him review
highly some wines that

00:44:13.290 --> 00:44:15.320
are very elegant and delicate.

00:44:15.320 --> 00:44:21.870
So my view is there's--
consumers like ratings.

00:44:21.870 --> 00:44:25.940
And for me as a
developing country,

00:44:25.940 --> 00:44:29.330
I would have had a hard
time proving to anybody

00:44:29.330 --> 00:44:32.170
that my wine was good
without these ratings.

00:44:32.170 --> 00:44:34.990
So for us, they've
worked really well.

00:44:34.990 --> 00:44:36.940
Does it seem unfair sometimes?

00:44:36.940 --> 00:44:38.472
I'll taste a really great wine.

00:44:38.472 --> 00:44:39.930
And it doesn't have
a great review.

00:44:39.930 --> 00:44:41.304
And I feel like,
wow this I would

00:44:41.304 --> 00:44:43.670
have given this wine 95 points.

00:44:43.670 --> 00:44:45.390
And it got 85.

00:44:45.390 --> 00:44:49.220
And if I were that wine
maker, I'd be pretty sad.

00:44:49.220 --> 00:44:53.530
But for us, it's given
us this opportunity

00:44:53.530 --> 00:44:55.610
to compete with the first world.

00:44:55.610 --> 00:45:01.020
So-- and I can tell you that
these people are totally legit.

00:45:01.020 --> 00:45:04.490
You cannot buy a score.

00:45:04.490 --> 00:45:05.950
You send your wine.

00:45:05.950 --> 00:45:06.800
They review it.

00:45:06.800 --> 00:45:08.680
And we've got mostly
great reviews.

00:45:08.680 --> 00:45:11.260
But we had a few bad reviews.

00:45:11.260 --> 00:45:18.176
And my dad sends us all
kinds of emails when we do.

00:45:18.176 --> 00:45:20.550
But thank you for that question,
very important question.

00:45:20.550 --> 00:45:20.710
Yeah.

00:45:20.710 --> 00:45:23.260
But in the end, I think you
should follow your own palate.

00:45:23.260 --> 00:45:24.760
If you taste a wine
and you love it,

00:45:24.760 --> 00:45:28.270
obviously ignore whatever
the reviewer said.

00:45:28.270 --> 00:45:31.470
But if you find a reviewer
that shares your palate.

00:45:31.470 --> 00:45:35.440
If you find that they generally
rate highly wines that you

00:45:35.440 --> 00:45:37.620
like, then you might
want to follow them.

00:45:37.620 --> 00:45:38.780
Especially if it's my wine.

00:45:41.550 --> 00:45:42.050
OK.

00:45:42.050 --> 00:45:43.770
Any other questions?

00:45:43.770 --> 00:45:45.130
Everybody's desperate to drink.

00:45:45.130 --> 00:45:47.290
We can keep on talking
about the wines.

00:45:47.290 --> 00:45:49.280
Oh, so the wines we're
going to drink today,

00:45:49.280 --> 00:45:50.956
we have the Catena
Alta chardonnay,

00:45:50.956 --> 00:45:52.580
which comes from the
Adrianna vineyard.

00:45:52.580 --> 00:45:54.580
We also have some
chardonnay planted there.

00:45:54.580 --> 00:45:56.440
And I brought the
Adrianna Malbec,

00:45:56.440 --> 00:45:58.420
which is a very
limited supply wine.

00:45:58.420 --> 00:46:01.800
We only make between 200
and 300 cases of that wine.

00:46:01.800 --> 00:46:05.920
So I had it actually shipped
specially for this tasting.

00:46:05.920 --> 00:46:08.620
And then we are also
having the Catena Malbec,

00:46:08.620 --> 00:46:10.660
which is more widely available.

00:46:10.660 --> 00:46:12.620
And it's a blend of
different altitudes.

00:46:12.620 --> 00:46:14.400
And it's really delicious.

00:46:14.400 --> 00:46:16.255
And so I hope you
enjoy the tasting.

00:46:16.255 --> 00:46:17.380
Was there another question?

00:46:17.380 --> 00:46:18.260
AUDIENCE: I have a question.

00:46:18.260 --> 00:46:19.009
LAURA CATENA: Yes.

00:46:19.009 --> 00:46:21.780
AUDIENCE: So speaking
about blends,

00:46:21.780 --> 00:46:25.970
would you agree that a blend is
when you get a wine blend, what

00:46:25.970 --> 00:46:30.632
you're getting is kind of the
chemistry of the winemaker.

00:46:30.632 --> 00:46:32.840
Like you're-- it's kind of
like going to a restaurant

00:46:32.840 --> 00:46:33.520
for a cook.

00:46:33.520 --> 00:46:34.270
LAURA CATENA: Yes.

00:46:34.270 --> 00:46:35.140
AUDIENCE: Because of the chef.

00:46:35.140 --> 00:46:36.960
To chef, the way the chef
puts the meals together

00:46:36.960 --> 00:46:37.543
and the foods.

00:46:37.543 --> 00:46:38.870
And I've always liked blends.

00:46:38.870 --> 00:46:40.911
And I'm wondering if that
has to do with the fact

00:46:40.911 --> 00:46:44.170
that what you're experiencing
is the taste of the winemaker,

00:46:44.170 --> 00:46:46.850
rather than the actual
purity of the varietal.

00:46:46.850 --> 00:46:48.910
LAURA CATENA: That is
just an awesome question.

00:46:48.910 --> 00:46:50.840
It's almost a half hour answer.

00:46:50.840 --> 00:46:52.890
But I won't do a half hour.

00:46:52.890 --> 00:46:56.680
So you can do blends within
a vineyard of different lots.

00:46:56.680 --> 00:46:59.920
You can do altitude blend, which
is what the Catena Malbec is.

00:46:59.920 --> 00:47:01.860
You can do blends
of many varieties.

00:47:01.860 --> 00:47:04.570
So for example, in
many parts of France,

00:47:04.570 --> 00:47:07.430
you're only allowed to
plant certain varieties.

00:47:07.430 --> 00:47:10.049
So in Bordeaux, you can
only find five varieties.

00:47:10.049 --> 00:47:11.590
And every wine from
Bordeaux is going

00:47:11.590 --> 00:47:15.100
to be a blend of one
or five of those.

00:47:15.100 --> 00:47:18.210
I think that traditional
blends like Bordeaux, people

00:47:18.210 --> 00:47:21.030
spend 400 years planting
these different varieties

00:47:21.030 --> 00:47:23.150
and figuring out what goes well.

00:47:23.150 --> 00:47:25.680
So generally, a blend
is going to be a wine

00:47:25.680 --> 00:47:28.100
that's very balanced
and that makes sense.

00:47:28.100 --> 00:47:31.380
Because somebody spent a lot
of time making that wine.

00:47:31.380 --> 00:47:35.770
And it might be a little
more elegant and smooth.

00:47:35.770 --> 00:47:38.300
Sometimes though, it's fun to
try a single vineyard wine.

00:47:38.300 --> 00:47:39.800
And you'll taste
the Adrianna, where

00:47:39.800 --> 00:47:41.460
you get a little edginess.

00:47:41.460 --> 00:47:45.140
And maybe it's not that perfect
of a wine, or not that smooth,

00:47:45.140 --> 00:47:47.134
but it has a very
distinctive style.

00:47:47.134 --> 00:47:48.550
So it's almost
like the difference

00:47:48.550 --> 00:47:50.610
between wearing something
that looks really good

00:47:50.610 --> 00:47:52.130
and wearing something crazy.

00:47:52.130 --> 00:47:53.520
Both are good.

00:47:53.520 --> 00:47:55.540
But it depends on what you like.

00:47:55.540 --> 00:47:59.870
And I do think that in blends,
the winemaker's palate is key.

00:47:59.870 --> 00:48:02.540
And one of things I tell
people about a family winery

00:48:02.540 --> 00:48:05.390
is that the only
guarantee I can give you

00:48:05.390 --> 00:48:07.660
is that my father and
I taste all the wines.

00:48:07.660 --> 00:48:10.090
And we like to
drink what we make.

00:48:10.090 --> 00:48:12.780
But I can't tell you the my wine
is better than my neighbor's.

00:48:12.780 --> 00:48:16.550
I can only tell you that I
am making a wine that I like.

00:48:16.550 --> 00:48:17.117
Yeah.

00:48:17.117 --> 00:48:17.950
Thank you very much.

00:48:17.950 --> 00:48:18.850
Gracias.

00:48:18.850 --> 00:48:20.400
[APPLAUSE]
