00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:01.080
Welcome.

00:00:01.080 --> 00:00:05.292
Thank you for coming
on this dreary day.

00:00:05.292 --> 00:00:07.500
Yesterday was so beautiful,
but I guess yesterday you

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:08.670
wouldn't have been here.

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:10.920
You might have wanted to
stay out in the nice weather.

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:15.270
So maybe it's an incentive
to come inside and share

00:00:15.270 --> 00:00:18.330
in the great pleasure of
having Min Jin Lee with us

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:20.349
this evening.

00:00:20.349 --> 00:00:22.140
So I'm going to read
a little introduction.

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:25.350
Min is going to read.

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:27.900
And then we'll have
a conversation.

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:31.470
I think we're nearing the
end of the academic year.

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:35.400
I just want to thank one more
time Professor Homi Bhabha,

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:39.420
Professor Steve Beal, and the
inimitable Sarah Raiser, who

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:42.409
makes everything happen,
who and everybody

00:00:42.409 --> 00:00:43.950
at the Mahindra
Humanities Center who

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:48.472
have organized these events
over the course of the year.

00:00:48.472 --> 00:00:49.680
And thank you all for coming.

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:53.830
Without you, we wouldn't
have any events.

00:00:53.830 --> 00:00:58.770
So I'm carrying a
microphone I don't need,

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:00.350
because there's one here.

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:02.340
Whatever.

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:05.370
It's been an amazing year for
Min Jin Lee and her highly

00:01:05.370 --> 00:01:08.520
acclaimed novel, Pachinko,
a New York Times best seller

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:12.540
for the better
part of this year.

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:14.490
By which I mean a whole year.

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:16.830
It was chosen by that
paper as one of the 10 best

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:21.000
books of 2017, was a finalist
for last year's National Book

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.690
Award, and has been lauded
by fellow writers as diverse

00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:28.290
as Junot Diaz, Colson Whitehead,
David Mitchell, and Roxanne

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:33.570
Gaye, who named Pachinko as
her favorite book of 2017.

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:35.880
Min is a recipient of
a Guggenheim Foundation

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:38.160
Fellowship for the
upcoming year and also,

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:41.010
wonderfully for us, of
a Radcliffe Fellowship

00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:45.030
thanks to Dean Liz Cohen, who
I think is, if she's not here,

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:46.540
she's on her way.

00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:49.800
This means that Min will be here
in Cambridge from September,

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:53.100
hopefully able at last to
work on her current project

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:55.800
after a long year on the
road, during which time

00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:58.860
she has visited more cities
than I know the names of and has

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:00.930
spoken to more
enthusiastic readers

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:04.200
than many writers
have in a lifetime.

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:07.670
But what this panoply of amazing
accolades, toasts, and treats

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:10.460
does not show is the rigorous
effort and commitment

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:12.500
behind the writing of this book.

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:14.660
Min's first novel, Free
Food For Millionaires

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:16.670
was published in 2007.

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:18.390
Also very well
received and translated

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:21.410
into numerous languages, it's a
scintillating and witty comedy

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:23.540
of manners that follows
the travails of Casey

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:26.240
Han, a young Korean American
Princeton graduate who

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:29.700
makes her way in New York at
the turn of the 21st century.

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:32.390
There was a full decade between
that book and the publication

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:35.150
of Pachinko, a sign of
the intense labor involved

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:38.120
in producing this rich
historical narrative.

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:41.450
But Min has explained that the
origins of Pachinko in fact

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:44.540
go back 30 years to her
undergraduate studies

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:47.810
at Yale, when she first learned
about the Korean community

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:49.130
in Japan.

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:50.960
She wrote an initial
version of the novel

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:52.760
in the late '90s,
a portion of which

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:56.480
was published in the
Missouri Review in 2002.

00:02:56.480 --> 00:03:00.230
In 2007, Min moved to Japan,
where she lived for four years,

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:02.190
and there she
discovered that quote,

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:05.930
"I had to change everything
and start again."

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:08.060
Pachinko is the
result, the marriage,

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:10.670
of many years of
research and revision

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:13.500
influenced by the realities
of the lives of the Korean

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:18.570
Japanese that Min encountered
when living in Japan.

00:03:18.570 --> 00:03:21.530
Dickensian in its scale and
in its roving omniscient

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:24.560
perspective, Pachinko also
offers a contemporary reader

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:27.200
the rich pleasures of
a 19th century novel,

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:30.680
an expansive cast of characters,
a broad sweep of time,

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:34.100
the flow of relationships
across borders and decades.

00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:37.100
At the center of the plot is
Sunja, a young Korean woman

00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:39.080
whose affair with an
older married businessman

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:40.640
will shape her future.

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:42.980
After she falls pregnant,
a young Christian minister

00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:44.870
marries her as an
act of charity,

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:46.340
and the couple
move to Japan where

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:48.770
we will follow their fates
and those of their relatives

00:03:48.770 --> 00:03:51.800
and offspring from the early
part of the 20th century

00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:53.870
through 1989.

00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:56.030
This bustling canvas
covers everything

00:03:56.030 --> 00:03:58.520
from the oppression of
Christians in pre-war Japan

00:03:58.520 --> 00:04:00.664
to the effects of AIDS.

00:04:00.664 --> 00:04:02.330
Part of Min's triumph
is to have written

00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:04.400
a novel that in spite
of its dark themes

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:05.780
is eminently readable.

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:09.420
Indeed, addictive is a word
many have used to describe it,

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:11.120
including myself.

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:13.850
She informs us about a
largely unknown chapter

00:04:13.850 --> 00:04:17.870
of Asian history, unknown that
is, to we ignorant Americans,

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:20.839
and addresses questions of
national and cultural identity,

00:04:20.839 --> 00:04:23.660
migration, disenfranchisement,
ambition, religion,

00:04:23.660 --> 00:04:24.860
and selfhood.

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:27.530
But this novel is
no worthy textbook.

00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:29.870
In an era of autofiction
and interiority,

00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:33.200
Pachinko marks a return to an
older form of storytelling,

00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:35.480
the broad tapestry
of social drama

00:04:35.480 --> 00:04:39.180
which affords the reader
enormous pleasure.

00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:42.850
Please join me in
welcoming Min Jin Lee.

00:04:42.850 --> 00:04:45.300
[APPLAUSE]

00:04:57.885 --> 00:04:58.385
Wow.

00:05:05.020 --> 00:05:07.580
Good evening.

00:05:07.580 --> 00:05:08.990
It's such a pleasure to be here.

00:05:08.990 --> 00:05:09.740
Thank you so much.

00:05:09.740 --> 00:05:12.950
I had no idea if
anybody would come.

00:05:12.950 --> 00:05:14.510
So thank you for
not embarrassing me

00:05:14.510 --> 00:05:15.845
in front of Claire.

00:05:15.845 --> 00:05:18.706
[LAUGHS] I wanted to thank--

00:05:18.706 --> 00:05:19.960
where's Sarah?

00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:22.520
I want to thank Sarah for
all the heavy lifting.

00:05:22.520 --> 00:05:24.800
I want to thank Claire
for this invitation.

00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:26.720
If anybody else
would have asked,

00:05:26.720 --> 00:05:28.610
I would have thought
about coming sometime

00:05:28.610 --> 00:05:29.670
this year or next year.

00:05:29.670 --> 00:05:33.500
But because Claire asked me
to come, I came immediately.

00:05:33.500 --> 00:05:34.880
I moved everything to come.

00:05:34.880 --> 00:05:36.710
Because you don't
know this, but I

00:05:36.710 --> 00:05:39.830
am such an incredible fan
of Claire Messud's fiction.

00:05:39.830 --> 00:05:41.100
She's an incredible writer.

00:05:41.100 --> 00:05:43.099
She's probably one of the
most important writers

00:05:43.099 --> 00:05:44.940
that we have produced
in this country.

00:05:44.940 --> 00:05:47.420
And I'm so full of
admiration for her fiction.

00:05:47.420 --> 00:05:51.670
The fact that she introduced
me is like, I'm just agog.

00:05:51.670 --> 00:05:54.110
[LAUGHS] So thank you, Claire.

00:05:54.110 --> 00:05:57.290
Thank you so much.

00:05:57.290 --> 00:06:01.010
Well, it's true, I'm
a very fast writer.

00:06:01.010 --> 00:06:03.117
This book only took me 30 years.

00:06:03.117 --> 00:06:05.840
[LAUGHS] It's so embarrassing.

00:06:05.840 --> 00:06:07.032
Oh my god.

00:06:07.032 --> 00:06:10.910
[LAUGHS] Every time I have to
explain why I took so long,

00:06:10.910 --> 00:06:13.550
I keep thinking,
couldn't you have thought

00:06:13.550 --> 00:06:15.750
of this in a different way?

00:06:15.750 --> 00:06:17.720
I think I should share
with you that I did not

00:06:17.720 --> 00:06:19.880
intend to be a fiction writer.

00:06:19.880 --> 00:06:23.210
I did not intend to
write a historical novel.

00:06:23.210 --> 00:06:25.430
I did not intend to be here.

00:06:25.430 --> 00:06:28.400
This is all quite a
big surprise to me.

00:06:28.400 --> 00:06:31.760
I did intend always,
however, to tell the truth.

00:06:31.760 --> 00:06:34.280
And I think that when you
are committed to the truth,

00:06:34.280 --> 00:06:36.650
there's something
that keeps you going

00:06:36.650 --> 00:06:38.720
and makes you pay
attention, and it

00:06:38.720 --> 00:06:41.570
makes you care about the
way you present the truth.

00:06:41.570 --> 00:06:45.050
And the truth that
happened to me in my life

00:06:45.050 --> 00:06:47.600
was that in 1989, when
I was in university,

00:06:47.600 --> 00:06:51.500
I was 19 years old,
I was very lost,

00:06:51.500 --> 00:06:54.020
because I didn't know
what to do with my life.

00:06:54.020 --> 00:06:57.140
I had applied to Yale
College because where

00:06:57.140 --> 00:06:58.680
Claire and I had
gone to college,

00:06:58.680 --> 00:07:00.680
but I think I'm older
than you, Claire aren't I?

00:07:00.680 --> 00:07:01.971
No, I think I'm older than you.

00:07:01.971 --> 00:07:02.870
OK.

00:07:02.870 --> 00:07:04.370
You look good.

00:07:04.370 --> 00:07:06.050
[LAUGHTER]

00:07:06.050 --> 00:07:10.160
So I applied to
college because I

00:07:10.160 --> 00:07:14.120
had fallen in love with an
author named Sinclair Lewis who

00:07:14.120 --> 00:07:18.500
wrote books like Main
Street, Arrowsmith, Babbitt,

00:07:18.500 --> 00:07:22.730
and most recently quite
relevant, It Can't Happen Here,

00:07:22.730 --> 00:07:27.410
where a fascist,
basically, and a dictator

00:07:27.410 --> 00:07:32.190
gets elected to
lead the government.

00:07:32.190 --> 00:07:37.670
Anyway, so I read these
books by Sinclair Lewis

00:07:37.670 --> 00:07:39.530
and it really just
kind of opened my head,

00:07:39.530 --> 00:07:41.270
and I really couldn't
quite figure out

00:07:41.270 --> 00:07:43.190
why he was so important to me.

00:07:43.190 --> 00:07:45.160
And I did a little
research on him,

00:07:45.160 --> 00:07:50.070
and back then, this was 1984
when I was in high school,

00:07:50.070 --> 00:07:52.730
I thought that I would
go to the library,

00:07:52.730 --> 00:07:55.220
because this before Google when
you can just type in a name

00:07:55.220 --> 00:07:57.530
and somebody's
biography just shows up,

00:07:57.530 --> 00:07:59.060
I researched into
Sinclair Lewis.

00:07:59.060 --> 00:08:03.920
And Sinclair Lewis was the
third son of a Minnesota doctor.

00:08:03.920 --> 00:08:06.560
And his mother had died,
and his father really

00:08:06.560 --> 00:08:10.100
didn't want him around because
he was kind of annoying.

00:08:10.100 --> 00:08:11.900
He was very tall.

00:08:11.900 --> 00:08:17.020
He had terrible skin and
really bad social manners.

00:08:17.020 --> 00:08:19.380
He had no friends.

00:08:19.380 --> 00:08:23.100
So of course, I
identified with him

00:08:23.100 --> 00:08:25.709
because I was like,
that's like me.

00:08:25.709 --> 00:08:27.750
And then after I read all
those books, I thought,

00:08:27.750 --> 00:08:29.880
I have to go to this
college that he went to,

00:08:29.880 --> 00:08:31.980
because he had gone there.

00:08:31.980 --> 00:08:36.030
And when I somehow miraculously
got into this other college

00:08:36.030 --> 00:08:40.350
in Connecticut, I
was so surprised

00:08:40.350 --> 00:08:43.679
because he wasn't there.

00:08:43.679 --> 00:08:47.430
It turned out that he
had graduated in 1908.

00:08:47.430 --> 00:08:50.800
So clearly math is
not my strong point.

00:08:50.800 --> 00:08:52.390
But I think there's
a part of me that

00:08:52.390 --> 00:08:55.350
thought the spirit of
Sinclair Lewis would be there.

00:08:55.350 --> 00:08:57.720
And in a way, it was.

00:08:57.720 --> 00:09:00.090
Because I think I
started to understand

00:09:00.090 --> 00:09:01.740
how writing was made.

00:09:01.740 --> 00:09:03.990
And I think that's what I
really learned in college.

00:09:03.990 --> 00:09:09.660
However, it never ever occurred
to me that I could be a writer.

00:09:09.660 --> 00:09:12.540
There wasn't anyone who looked
like me who was a writer.

00:09:12.540 --> 00:09:15.330
All the people that I
read didn't look like me.

00:09:15.330 --> 00:09:17.880
And of course, I wasn't
like Sinclair Lewis.

00:09:17.880 --> 00:09:21.600
I could admire Sinclair
Lewis, but it wasn't something

00:09:21.600 --> 00:09:22.860
that I thought I could do.

00:09:25.970 --> 00:09:29.130
Anyway, I did take an Asian
American literature class,

00:09:29.130 --> 00:09:32.940
because I thought maybe Asian
Americans do write literature.

00:09:32.940 --> 00:09:36.780
And then I read two books
by Korean Americans.

00:09:36.780 --> 00:09:39.990
One was a book called
Dictee by Theresa Hak Kyung

00:09:39.990 --> 00:09:44.310
Cha, which is a kind of an
experimental, incredible work.

00:09:44.310 --> 00:09:46.130
It's kind of fiction
and nonfiction,

00:09:46.130 --> 00:09:48.970
and it has every
single language.

00:09:48.970 --> 00:09:51.360
And it was really brilliant
and I really admired it.

00:09:51.360 --> 00:09:53.340
I don't think I
understood all of it.

00:09:53.340 --> 00:09:55.770
But I was like, wow,
somebody could make this,

00:09:55.770 --> 00:09:57.270
and she could be
Korean American.

00:09:57.270 --> 00:09:59.910
And then I researched,
again, pre Google,

00:09:59.910 --> 00:10:03.180
and it turned out that she was
violently raped and murdered

00:10:03.180 --> 00:10:06.410
right after she published
this book in 1985.

00:10:06.410 --> 00:10:08.970
And I thought, that's not good.

00:10:08.970 --> 00:10:12.870
And then I read another book,
the other book in the syllabus

00:10:12.870 --> 00:10:14.280
by a Korean American.

00:10:14.280 --> 00:10:17.730
It was called Clay
Walls by Kim Ronyoung.

00:10:17.730 --> 00:10:20.610
A really fantastic
historical novel which nobody

00:10:20.610 --> 00:10:22.290
reads anymore, but
I really encourage

00:10:22.290 --> 00:10:23.340
you to take a look at it.

00:10:23.340 --> 00:10:25.020
It's published by an
independent press.

00:10:25.020 --> 00:10:27.090
You can get it anywhere.

00:10:27.090 --> 00:10:30.794
And after I read it, I thought,
wow, look, it can be done.

00:10:30.794 --> 00:10:33.210
And then it turned out that
she had died from cancer right

00:10:33.210 --> 00:10:35.190
after publishing that book.

00:10:35.190 --> 00:10:36.440
So I went to law school.

00:10:36.440 --> 00:10:38.192
[LAUGHTER]

00:10:39.179 --> 00:10:40.970
I thought it was wise
on multiple accounts.

00:10:45.135 --> 00:10:47.790
But before I went
to law school, I

00:10:47.790 --> 00:10:49.770
decided that I was going
to major in history.

00:10:49.770 --> 00:10:53.160
And I was invited to a lecture
by the university chaplain

00:10:53.160 --> 00:10:54.020
Harry Adams.

00:10:54.020 --> 00:10:55.361
Do you know Harry Adams?

00:10:55.361 --> 00:10:55.860
OK.

00:10:55.860 --> 00:10:59.620
So I was one of the few kids
who went to church at Yale.

00:10:59.620 --> 00:11:00.841
And it was odd.

00:11:00.841 --> 00:11:03.090
I don't know what it is, but
I feel really comfortable

00:11:03.090 --> 00:11:03.900
at church.

00:11:03.900 --> 00:11:09.460
I don't really like Christians
that much, but I like church.

00:11:09.460 --> 00:11:12.390
It's like the most honest
thing I can tell you.

00:11:12.390 --> 00:11:15.780
So I think I was one of the very
few undergraduates who attended

00:11:15.780 --> 00:11:17.390
services at Battell Chapel.

00:11:17.390 --> 00:11:20.719
And it was always me and
all these empty pews,

00:11:20.719 --> 00:11:22.260
because no one really
went to church,

00:11:22.260 --> 00:11:24.840
because it was completely
not a cool thing to do.

00:11:24.840 --> 00:11:27.240
And I think Harry Adams
University chaplain, who

00:11:27.240 --> 00:11:31.890
also taught sermonology,
that's actually a topic,

00:11:31.890 --> 00:11:34.439
at the Divinity School, gave
these incredibly cool sermons.

00:11:34.439 --> 00:11:36.730
And I would just sit there
going, wow, this is so neat.

00:11:36.730 --> 00:11:38.280
And none of my friends
ever want to go to church.

00:11:38.280 --> 00:11:39.210
All right, whatever.

00:11:39.210 --> 00:11:40.330
But I sat there.

00:11:40.330 --> 00:11:42.660
But I think he felt sorry
for me, and at the same time

00:11:42.660 --> 00:11:45.240
I was probably his
only constituent.

00:11:45.240 --> 00:11:47.670
So I was his parish.

00:11:47.670 --> 00:11:50.670
And one day he
asked me if I would

00:11:50.670 --> 00:11:53.305
go to a master's tea, which
they don't have anymore.

00:11:53.305 --> 00:11:55.680
They have college teas, but
they don't have master's teas

00:11:55.680 --> 00:11:56.180
anymore.

00:11:56.180 --> 00:11:59.700
And they invite people to
come in and talk about things

00:11:59.700 --> 00:12:01.420
that are going on in the world.

00:12:01.420 --> 00:12:04.050
And I said yes, because
I could not imagine

00:12:04.050 --> 00:12:06.810
saying no to Harry Adams.

00:12:06.810 --> 00:12:08.680
So I go to this thing.

00:12:08.680 --> 00:12:14.780
And it turns out that there
are four people in the room.

00:12:14.780 --> 00:12:19.280
The speaker, Harry Adams, me,
and another undergraduate,

00:12:19.280 --> 00:12:21.470
Wilson.

00:12:21.470 --> 00:12:23.750
You can't leave.

00:12:23.750 --> 00:12:26.660
So I just sat there
and I ate cookies

00:12:26.660 --> 00:12:29.390
and I listened to this
American missionary talk.

00:12:29.390 --> 00:12:31.640
And I thought, oh my gosh,
an American missionary.

00:12:31.640 --> 00:12:33.380
How dreadful.

00:12:33.380 --> 00:12:34.550
How colonialist.

00:12:34.550 --> 00:12:36.470
[LAUGHS]

00:12:39.410 --> 00:12:41.226
And all I could think
of are these kind

00:12:41.226 --> 00:12:43.100
of ideas that I would
read in history classes

00:12:43.100 --> 00:12:48.170
about Christianizing the savages
and just all these things that

00:12:48.170 --> 00:12:49.670
really offended me politically.

00:12:49.670 --> 00:12:51.336
And I'm sitting there
thinking, I'm just

00:12:51.336 --> 00:12:53.457
going to eat my cookies
and it'll be 45 minutes

00:12:53.457 --> 00:12:54.290
and it will be over.

00:12:54.290 --> 00:12:56.480
How bad could it be?

00:12:56.480 --> 00:12:59.510
And then the American missionary
worked with the Koreans

00:12:59.510 --> 00:13:01.070
in Japan.

00:13:01.070 --> 00:13:08.010
And he told the three of us the
history of the Koreans in Japan

00:13:08.010 --> 00:13:10.860
and how what an incredibly
troubling history this was.

00:13:10.860 --> 00:13:13.290
And I thought,
this is quite sad,

00:13:13.290 --> 00:13:16.290
and I didn't know
anything about it.

00:13:16.290 --> 00:13:20.410
None of this was taught to me
at any part of my education,

00:13:20.410 --> 00:13:21.600
including at home.

00:13:21.600 --> 00:13:24.372
I knew that the Koreans were
colonized by the Japanese,

00:13:24.372 --> 00:13:25.830
but I didn't really
understand what

00:13:25.830 --> 00:13:28.920
it meant to be Korean
living in Japan

00:13:28.920 --> 00:13:32.220
and having stayed there for
four or five generations.

00:13:32.220 --> 00:13:33.780
And then he mentioned
this one story

00:13:33.780 --> 00:13:37.800
about a little boy
who was in his parish.

00:13:37.800 --> 00:13:40.230
This 13-year-old
child had climbed up

00:13:40.230 --> 00:13:44.010
to an apartment building
and he jumped to his death.

00:13:44.010 --> 00:13:46.890
And then his parents--

00:13:46.890 --> 00:13:48.330
I'm losing somebody already.

00:13:50.940 --> 00:13:55.410
So the parents were
really so traumatized

00:13:55.410 --> 00:13:58.470
by this little boy's death, and
they went through his things

00:13:58.470 --> 00:14:02.940
to try to figure out why
this boy would kill himself.

00:14:02.940 --> 00:14:04.770
And they found his
middle school yearbook,

00:14:04.770 --> 00:14:06.770
because a boy had
just graduated.

00:14:06.770 --> 00:14:08.550
And in the middle
school yearbook,

00:14:08.550 --> 00:14:12.090
his Japanese
classmates had written,

00:14:12.090 --> 00:14:15.840
go back to where you
belong, I hate you,

00:14:15.840 --> 00:14:18.630
you smell like garlic,
you smell like kimchi.

00:14:18.630 --> 00:14:23.610
And they wrote the
words die, die, die.

00:14:23.610 --> 00:14:26.940
And that story basically
changed the course of my life.

00:14:26.940 --> 00:14:30.370
I didn't know that it was
changing the course of my life.

00:14:30.370 --> 00:14:33.540
And I think that there should
be a public service announcement

00:14:33.540 --> 00:14:36.660
that says that when you attend
lectures at universities

00:14:36.660 --> 00:14:39.120
with guest speakers,
your life could change.

00:14:39.120 --> 00:14:42.630
[LAUGHS]

00:14:42.630 --> 00:14:44.780
I couldn't forget the story.

00:14:44.780 --> 00:14:46.150
It was so troubling to me.

00:14:46.150 --> 00:14:48.880
And even though I did
graduate as a history major,

00:14:48.880 --> 00:14:51.060
even though I did go to
law school and practice

00:14:51.060 --> 00:14:54.150
for two years, I
knew that somehow I

00:14:54.150 --> 00:14:57.210
needed to understand
this truth for this child

00:14:57.210 --> 00:14:59.200
and for this family.

00:14:59.200 --> 00:15:01.800
And then after I
quit being a lawyer,

00:15:01.800 --> 00:15:05.760
I wrote one novel called
Revival of the Senses, which

00:15:05.760 --> 00:15:11.090
was really pretentious, and
it was rejected by everybody.

00:15:11.090 --> 00:15:12.020
Everybody.

00:15:12.020 --> 00:15:15.590
Like, on beautiful,
creamy stationery.

00:15:15.590 --> 00:15:18.290
And there wasn't a
single encouraging word

00:15:18.290 --> 00:15:20.040
like continue, revise.

00:15:20.040 --> 00:15:22.710
[LAUGHS] It wasn't there.

00:15:22.710 --> 00:15:25.815
And I have copies to prove it.

00:15:25.815 --> 00:15:28.190
And then I thought I would
write a book about the Koreans

00:15:28.190 --> 00:15:29.280
in Japan.

00:15:29.280 --> 00:15:32.790
So I sat down, and
like a good student,

00:15:32.790 --> 00:15:34.920
I did all the research
that was necessary

00:15:34.920 --> 00:15:36.230
and that was available to me.

00:15:36.230 --> 00:15:39.200
I read a great deal of
immense, tremendous scholarship

00:15:39.200 --> 00:15:42.900
by people in the disciplines
of sociology, history,

00:15:42.900 --> 00:15:45.050
anthropology, and
immigration law.

00:15:45.050 --> 00:15:47.600
And I put together this kind
of idea about the Koreans

00:15:47.600 --> 00:15:48.170
in Japan.

00:15:48.170 --> 00:15:51.980
And I wrote a book
between 1996 to 2003.

00:15:51.980 --> 00:15:56.340
And then after I finished it,
I realized it too was dreadful.

00:15:56.340 --> 00:15:57.410
So I didn't send it out.

00:15:57.410 --> 00:16:00.440
And at that point, I was very
discouraged with my life.

00:16:00.440 --> 00:16:04.550
And then I decided that I
would write about the Koreans

00:16:04.550 --> 00:16:06.320
in America.

00:16:06.320 --> 00:16:09.860
Today I'm going to read to
you a very, very short section

00:16:09.860 --> 00:16:13.580
of this book Pachinko,
which eventually came out

00:16:13.580 --> 00:16:16.400
of the earlier
version that I wrote.

00:16:16.400 --> 00:16:19.280
We are going to have--
it's a very brief reading.

00:16:19.280 --> 00:16:22.100
It's about six minutes total.

00:16:22.100 --> 00:16:26.360
And we are not in
Cambridge right now.

00:16:26.360 --> 00:16:27.470
We are in Yokohama.

00:16:27.470 --> 00:16:29.840
It is 1976.

00:16:29.840 --> 00:16:32.330
And in this scene, there
are three characters

00:16:32.330 --> 00:16:33.650
that we can be mindful of.

00:16:33.650 --> 00:16:39.620
We have Moses, a pachinko
parlor owner, his son, Solomon,

00:16:39.620 --> 00:16:42.160
who is a teenage
boy, and then we also

00:16:42.160 --> 00:16:46.390
have Etsuko, who is Japanese,
and she is a restaurant owner.

00:16:46.390 --> 00:16:48.190
And I wanted to read
this to you today

00:16:48.190 --> 00:16:52.600
because I think that right now
I am heartbroken, as many of you

00:16:52.600 --> 00:16:56.600
may be, about the way we treat
outsiders in this country.

00:16:56.600 --> 00:16:59.470
I know that it doesn't represent
the best of who we are,

00:16:59.470 --> 00:17:01.840
but I know that there are
many pockets of resistance

00:17:01.840 --> 00:17:06.700
in this country that really
believe that outsiders are also

00:17:06.700 --> 00:17:09.280
part of our family.

00:17:09.280 --> 00:17:11.020
So I share this with you.

00:17:11.020 --> 00:17:12.700
Right now we are
not in Cambridge.

00:17:12.700 --> 00:17:14.230
It's 1976.

00:17:14.230 --> 00:17:16.089
We're in Yokohama, and
I hope that you will

00:17:16.089 --> 00:17:17.770
do what we readers do best.

00:17:17.770 --> 00:17:19.660
I hope that you will
imagine with me.

00:17:25.060 --> 00:17:29.720
The Yokohama ward office
was a giant gray box

00:17:29.720 --> 00:17:31.800
with an obscure sign.

00:17:31.800 --> 00:17:33.980
And the first
clerk that they saw

00:17:33.980 --> 00:17:37.580
was a very tall man
with a narrow face

00:17:37.580 --> 00:17:41.300
and a shock of black hair
buzzed off at the sides.

00:17:41.300 --> 00:17:44.120
And he stared at
Etsuko shamelessly,

00:17:44.120 --> 00:17:48.050
his eyes darting across
her breasts, her hips,

00:17:48.050 --> 00:17:51.300
and her jeweled fingers.

00:17:51.300 --> 00:17:54.720
She was overdressed compared
to Moses and Solomon, who

00:17:54.720 --> 00:17:59.820
wore white dress shirts, dark
slacks, and black dress shoes.

00:17:59.820 --> 00:18:02.490
And they looked like the
gentle Mormon missionaries

00:18:02.490 --> 00:18:06.532
who used to glide through
her village on their bicycles

00:18:06.532 --> 00:18:07.365
when she was a girl.

00:18:12.760 --> 00:18:15.820
"Your name."

00:18:15.820 --> 00:18:22.820
The clerk squinted at the form
that Solomon was filling out.

00:18:22.820 --> 00:18:25.400
"Solomon."

00:18:25.400 --> 00:18:27.095
"What kind of name is that?"

00:18:31.370 --> 00:18:33.750
"It's from the Bible.

00:18:33.750 --> 00:18:40.380
He was a King and the son of
David, a man of great wisdom.

00:18:40.380 --> 00:18:44.000
My great uncle named me."

00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:49.360
And the boy smiled at the clerk
as if he were sharing a secret.

00:18:49.360 --> 00:18:52.110
He was a very polite
boy, but because he

00:18:52.110 --> 00:18:54.690
had gone to school
with Americans

00:18:54.690 --> 00:18:59.130
and other kinds of foreigners
at his international schools,

00:18:59.130 --> 00:19:03.720
he sometimes said things that a
Japanese would never have said.

00:19:08.700 --> 00:19:10.870
"Solomon.

00:19:10.870 --> 00:19:12.670
King.

00:19:12.670 --> 00:19:13.880
Great wisdom.

00:19:17.030 --> 00:19:19.920
Koreans don't have
kings anymore."

00:19:23.370 --> 00:19:25.780
"What did you say?"

00:19:25.780 --> 00:19:27.960
Etsuko asked.

00:19:27.960 --> 00:19:32.150
And quickly Moses
pulled her back.

00:19:32.150 --> 00:19:34.460
And she glanced at Moses.

00:19:34.460 --> 00:19:37.280
His temper was far
worse than hers.

00:19:37.280 --> 00:19:43.100
Once when a restaurant guest had
tried to make her sit with him,

00:19:43.100 --> 00:19:46.490
Moses, who happened to
be there that night,

00:19:46.490 --> 00:19:49.550
walked over, picked
him up bodily,

00:19:49.550 --> 00:19:51.680
and threw him outside
the restaurant,

00:19:51.680 --> 00:19:54.770
breaking the man's ribs.

00:19:54.770 --> 00:19:59.551
And she was expecting no
less of a reaction now.

00:19:59.551 --> 00:20:04.690
But Moses averted his
eyes from the clerk

00:20:04.690 --> 00:20:09.510
and stared at
Solomon's right hand.

00:20:09.510 --> 00:20:10.335
And Moses smiled.

00:20:14.830 --> 00:20:17.870
"Excuse me, sir.

00:20:17.870 --> 00:20:22.650
We're in a hurry to
return home, because it's

00:20:22.650 --> 00:20:25.340
the boy's birthday.

00:20:25.340 --> 00:20:29.820
Is there anything else
that we should do?

00:20:29.820 --> 00:20:33.510
Thank you very much
for understanding."

00:20:33.510 --> 00:20:37.890
And confused, Solomon
turned to Etsuko,

00:20:37.890 --> 00:20:42.070
and she flashed
him a warning look.

00:20:42.070 --> 00:20:46.240
And the clerk pointed
to the back of the room

00:20:46.240 --> 00:20:51.450
and told Moses and
Etsuko to sit down.

00:20:51.450 --> 00:20:56.280
And Solomon remained
standing opposite the clerk.

00:20:56.280 --> 00:21:01.440
And in the long, rectangular
room shaped like a train car,

00:21:01.440 --> 00:21:06.540
with bank teller windows running
parallel along opposite walls,

00:21:06.540 --> 00:21:10.080
half a dozen people
sat on benches reading

00:21:10.080 --> 00:21:12.780
their newspapers and manga.

00:21:12.780 --> 00:21:18.060
And Etsuko wondered if
they were all Korean.

00:21:18.060 --> 00:21:21.630
And Moses sat down, and
then he got up again,

00:21:21.630 --> 00:21:23.980
and he asked if she
wanted a can of tea

00:21:23.980 --> 00:21:26.620
from the vending machine,
and she nodded yes.

00:21:29.270 --> 00:21:33.900
She felt like slapping
the clerk's face.

00:21:33.900 --> 00:21:41.120
In middle school, she had
once slapped a gossipy girl,

00:21:41.120 --> 00:21:42.800
and it had been very satisfying.

00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:49.940
When Moses returned with
their tea, she thanked him.

00:21:54.020 --> 00:21:56.700
"You must have known.

00:21:56.700 --> 00:21:59.460
You must have warned him.

00:21:59.460 --> 00:22:03.570
I mean, you told him that today
would not be so easy, no?"

00:22:06.460 --> 00:22:11.600
And after the words came
out, they sounded harsh

00:22:11.600 --> 00:22:12.625
and she felt sorry.

00:22:16.810 --> 00:22:19.270
"No.

00:22:19.270 --> 00:22:20.195
I didn't say anything.

00:22:22.760 --> 00:22:26.010
I didn't say anything to him."

00:22:26.010 --> 00:22:30.640
And he opened and he closed
his fists rhythmically.

00:22:30.640 --> 00:22:33.670
"I came here with my
mother and brother

00:22:33.670 --> 00:22:38.640
Noa for my first
registration papers.

00:22:38.640 --> 00:22:42.700
The clerk was normal, nice even.

00:22:45.430 --> 00:22:48.090
So I asked you to come.

00:22:48.090 --> 00:22:55.870
I thought maybe having a woman,
a Japanese woman, would help."

00:22:58.950 --> 00:23:00.565
And he exhaled
through his nostrils.

00:23:03.460 --> 00:23:05.950
"It was stupid to
wish for a kindness."

00:23:08.610 --> 00:23:10.080
"No, no, no.

00:23:10.080 --> 00:23:13.320
You couldn't have warned him.

00:23:13.320 --> 00:23:14.980
I shouldn't have
said it like that."

00:23:19.890 --> 00:23:22.250
"It is hopeless.

00:23:22.250 --> 00:23:24.470
I cannot change his fate.

00:23:24.470 --> 00:23:26.570
He is Korean.

00:23:26.570 --> 00:23:29.800
He has to get
those papers and he

00:23:29.800 --> 00:23:35.590
has to follow all the
steps of the law perfectly.

00:23:35.590 --> 00:23:40.160
Once at a ward's
office, a clerk told me

00:23:40.160 --> 00:23:41.735
that I was a guest
in his country."

00:23:45.120 --> 00:23:46.975
"You and Solomon
were born here."

00:23:50.628 --> 00:23:53.050
"Yes.

00:23:53.050 --> 00:23:55.980
My brother Noa was
born here too."

00:23:55.980 --> 00:24:01.590
And Moses covered his
face with his hands.

00:24:01.590 --> 00:24:06.960
"Anyway, the clerk wasn't
wrong, and this is something

00:24:06.960 --> 00:24:10.350
that Solomon must understand.

00:24:13.640 --> 00:24:17.140
We can be deported.

00:24:17.140 --> 00:24:20.600
We have no motherland.

00:24:20.600 --> 00:24:26.450
And life is full of things
that he cannot control.

00:24:26.450 --> 00:24:27.550
So he must adapt.

00:24:30.770 --> 00:24:32.210
My boy has to survive."

00:24:34.830 --> 00:24:38.310
And Solomon returned to them.

00:24:38.310 --> 00:24:40.920
And next he had his
photograph taken.

00:24:40.920 --> 00:24:44.280
And afterward, he had
to go to another room

00:24:44.280 --> 00:24:46.410
to get fingerprinted.

00:24:46.410 --> 00:24:49.520
And then they can go home.

00:24:49.520 --> 00:24:54.860
She took Solomon's
left index finger

00:24:54.860 --> 00:25:01.290
and gently dipped into the pot
filled with thick, black ink.

00:25:01.290 --> 00:25:04.430
And the clerk
watched him do this.

00:25:04.430 --> 00:25:08.570
Solomon depressed his
finger onto a white card,

00:25:08.570 --> 00:25:10.295
as if he was a child painting.

00:25:13.050 --> 00:25:18.740
And Moses looked away,
and he sighed audibly.

00:25:18.740 --> 00:25:21.800
The clerk told him to
pick up the registration

00:25:21.800 --> 00:25:24.340
papers in the next room.

00:25:29.920 --> 00:25:34.450
"Let's get your dog
tags," Moses said.

00:25:37.140 --> 00:25:39.220
Solomon faced his father.

00:25:39.220 --> 00:25:39.720
"Hm?"

00:25:42.690 --> 00:25:46.720
"It's what we dogs must have."

00:25:46.720 --> 00:25:51.210
And the clerk looked
furious suddenly.

00:25:51.210 --> 00:25:54.000
"The fingerprints and
the registration cards

00:25:54.000 --> 00:25:57.120
are vitally important
for government records.

00:25:57.120 --> 00:26:00.660
There is no need to
feel insulted by this.

00:26:00.660 --> 00:26:05.290
It is an immigration regulation
required for foreign--"

00:26:05.290 --> 00:26:09.670
And Etsuko stepped forward.

00:26:09.670 --> 00:26:13.600
But you don't make your
children get fingerprinted

00:26:13.600 --> 00:26:17.480
on their birthday, do you?

00:26:17.480 --> 00:26:19.480
And the clerk's neck turned red.

00:26:22.790 --> 00:26:23.680
"My son is dead."

00:26:27.990 --> 00:26:31.530
And Etsuko bit her lip.

00:26:31.530 --> 00:26:35.380
She didn't want to feel
anything for this woman.

00:26:35.380 --> 00:26:39.300
But she knew what it was
like to lose your children.

00:26:39.300 --> 00:26:44.220
It was like you're cursed,
and nothing would ever restore

00:26:44.220 --> 00:26:45.870
the desolation in your life.

00:26:49.010 --> 00:26:53.900
"Koreans do a lot of good for
this country," Etsuko said.

00:26:53.900 --> 00:26:57.350
"They do the difficult jobs that
the Japanese don't want to do.

00:26:57.350 --> 00:27:00.770
They pay taxes, they obey
laws, they raise good families,

00:27:00.770 --> 00:27:01.810
they create jobs."

00:27:06.250 --> 00:27:08.650
"You Koreans always
tell me this."

00:27:13.350 --> 00:27:18.030
And Etsuko touched his
arm and the three of them

00:27:18.030 --> 00:27:21.210
walked out of the building.

00:27:21.210 --> 00:27:27.080
She wanted to crawl
outside of the gray box

00:27:27.080 --> 00:27:31.160
and see the light
of outdoors again.

00:27:31.160 --> 00:27:34.610
She long for the white
mountains of Hokkaido

00:27:34.610 --> 00:27:38.720
and though she had never
done so in her childhood,

00:27:38.720 --> 00:27:43.100
she wanted to walk in
the cold, snowy forests

00:27:43.100 --> 00:27:47.800
beneath the flanks of
the dark, leafless trees.

00:27:47.800 --> 00:27:53.020
In life there was so
much insult and injury,

00:27:53.020 --> 00:27:57.450
and she had no choice but
to collect what was hers.

00:27:57.450 --> 00:28:03.150
But now she wished to
take Solomon's shame

00:28:03.150 --> 00:28:10.080
and add it to her pile although
she was already so overwhelmed.

00:28:10.080 --> 00:28:11.520
Thank you.

00:28:11.520 --> 00:28:13.995
[APPLAUSE]

00:28:28.360 --> 00:28:31.510
I have never had people
give me paper before.

00:28:31.510 --> 00:28:32.890
And you can take it home.

00:28:32.890 --> 00:28:34.360
Oh my.

00:28:34.360 --> 00:28:36.140
Don't tell anyone I said so.

00:28:36.140 --> 00:28:38.140
You can take it home.

00:28:38.140 --> 00:28:39.060
Is that OK, Sarah?

00:28:39.060 --> 00:28:40.210
Can I take it?

00:28:40.210 --> 00:28:42.412
What did I do with my glasses?

00:28:42.412 --> 00:28:44.340
Did I lose my glasses?

00:28:47.240 --> 00:28:48.820
Well, I lost my glasses.

00:28:48.820 --> 00:28:49.700
They're right there.

00:28:49.700 --> 00:28:50.400
Oh, thank you.

00:28:50.400 --> 00:28:51.400
Thank you, young person.

00:28:51.400 --> 00:28:52.790
I stood up and they fell down.

00:28:52.790 --> 00:28:53.790
That's very kind of you.

00:28:53.790 --> 00:28:54.710
Thank you.

00:28:54.710 --> 00:28:57.410
Thank you.

00:28:57.410 --> 00:29:00.020
Thank you for that
beautiful reading.

00:29:00.020 --> 00:29:07.650
It makes me want to-- perhaps
a place to start is to ask you,

00:29:07.650 --> 00:29:13.470
I mean, all the research in
the world couldn't give you--

00:29:13.470 --> 00:29:15.160
I mean, you used
statistics on that,

00:29:15.160 --> 00:29:17.110
but it couldn't give you that.

00:29:17.110 --> 00:29:21.130
And to ask how things
changed when you actually

00:29:21.130 --> 00:29:24.520
went and spent time in Japan.

00:29:24.520 --> 00:29:26.440
You know, everybody
wants to know.

00:29:26.440 --> 00:29:29.110
And this is a really
important question,

00:29:29.110 --> 00:29:31.060
because we're trying
to understand how

00:29:31.060 --> 00:29:34.540
does this history affect today.

00:29:34.540 --> 00:29:39.575
And I was really struck because
Japan is an amazing country.

00:29:39.575 --> 00:29:41.200
And for those of you
who've been there,

00:29:41.200 --> 00:29:43.030
you're going to like it if you--

00:29:43.030 --> 00:29:44.410
I'm sure you like it a lot.

00:29:44.410 --> 00:29:46.120
You should visit if
you have not been.

00:29:46.120 --> 00:29:48.180
The food there is
better than France.

00:29:48.180 --> 00:29:49.150
Really.

00:29:49.150 --> 00:29:52.150
French people say this.

00:29:52.150 --> 00:29:53.470
I have quotes.

00:29:53.470 --> 00:29:57.070
And I loved living
there in part.

00:29:57.070 --> 00:29:58.990
But the part that was
really hard for me

00:29:58.990 --> 00:30:04.060
is that it's not a culture in
which you are meant to stay.

00:30:04.060 --> 00:30:06.130
You are meant to visit.

00:30:06.130 --> 00:30:12.520
And if you stay, you will
never, ever, ever be Japanese.

00:30:12.520 --> 00:30:14.810
So you could stay
there for 100 years.

00:30:14.810 --> 00:30:18.280
But if you're not by blood
Japanese, you are not Japanese.

00:30:18.280 --> 00:30:22.150
And in their defense, and I
can't believe I'm saying this,

00:30:22.150 --> 00:30:24.970
in their defense, I understand.

00:30:24.970 --> 00:30:26.980
Most of the world
actually believes

00:30:26.980 --> 00:30:31.430
that you do not have citizenship
or acceptance as a birthright.

00:30:31.430 --> 00:30:36.010
The United States, Canada,
Australia, the United Kingdom,

00:30:36.010 --> 00:30:38.410
that's a very special
idea that we're

00:30:38.410 --> 00:30:40.930
going to give you
citizenship and acceptance

00:30:40.930 --> 00:30:43.300
just because you're
born in that country.

00:30:43.300 --> 00:30:45.040
Most other places in
the world, actually

00:30:45.040 --> 00:30:48.290
the majority of the countries
in the world, it is by blood.

00:30:48.290 --> 00:30:51.760
So I do understand
it, and I think

00:30:51.760 --> 00:30:54.190
that it's not necessarily
something that I admire

00:30:54.190 --> 00:30:59.620
or want to have in my
paradigm of the ideal utopia,

00:30:59.620 --> 00:31:02.200
but it is what it is.

00:31:02.200 --> 00:31:04.450
And you have to take
the consequences for it.

00:31:04.450 --> 00:31:09.640
So when you have all these
advanced economies basically

00:31:09.640 --> 00:31:12.940
limiting immigration,
you have the consequences

00:31:12.940 --> 00:31:15.460
of not having people who are
going to take care of you

00:31:15.460 --> 00:31:16.780
when you get older too.

00:31:16.780 --> 00:31:20.310
And you don't have
social surpluses in terms

00:31:20.310 --> 00:31:21.560
of taxes and things like that.

00:31:21.560 --> 00:31:25.510
But to go back to your
question, even today in 2018,

00:31:25.510 --> 00:31:28.540
you could be ethnically
Korean, and you are not

00:31:28.540 --> 00:31:29.740
considered Japanese.

00:31:29.740 --> 00:31:31.870
Even if you're a
third generation or?

00:31:31.870 --> 00:31:35.050
You could be fifth generation
with legal citizenship, which

00:31:35.050 --> 00:31:36.490
is not easy to get.

00:31:36.490 --> 00:31:37.930
You can get it.

00:31:37.930 --> 00:31:39.430
And if you were to
get it, you still

00:31:39.430 --> 00:31:41.179
would not be considered
a Japanese person.

00:31:41.179 --> 00:31:44.860
You would have the rights and
liberties in a legal sense,

00:31:44.860 --> 00:31:46.770
but not really.

00:31:46.770 --> 00:31:52.240
But so people like
Moses and Solomon.

00:31:52.240 --> 00:31:52.830
They wouldn't?

00:31:52.830 --> 00:31:54.070
What passport would they get?

00:31:54.070 --> 00:31:56.360
They would have a South
Korean passport, most likely.

00:31:56.360 --> 00:31:58.110
So right now there's
three different kinds

00:31:58.110 --> 00:31:59.290
of Koreans in Japan.

00:31:59.290 --> 00:32:01.420
You could be a North
Korean Japanese.

00:32:01.420 --> 00:32:03.370
And there are North
Korean Japanese today

00:32:03.370 --> 00:32:06.160
who are fourth or fifth
generation Korean Japanese.

00:32:06.160 --> 00:32:08.890
And they don't have a passport,
because Japan and North

00:32:08.890 --> 00:32:11.050
Korea do not have a
diplomatic relationship.

00:32:11.050 --> 00:32:12.970
They have a little
card, and they would

00:32:12.970 --> 00:32:14.980
register on a regular basis.

00:32:14.980 --> 00:32:19.750
And the years change, whatever
term it is for that year.

00:32:19.750 --> 00:32:22.450
You would go register
in the [KOREAN] office.

00:32:22.450 --> 00:32:24.190
It was a North Korean
office in which

00:32:24.190 --> 00:32:26.170
you have to register yourself.

00:32:26.170 --> 00:32:28.630
Or you would be a South
Korean Japanese citizen,

00:32:28.630 --> 00:32:30.640
much like my characters.

00:32:30.640 --> 00:32:33.010
And you would have a
South Korean passport.

00:32:33.010 --> 00:32:35.600
You don't have a
Japanese passport.

00:32:35.600 --> 00:32:37.600
And even if you've never
been to South Korea,

00:32:37.600 --> 00:32:39.824
you have a South
Korean passport.

00:32:39.824 --> 00:32:40.990
You're a permanent resident.

00:32:40.990 --> 00:32:41.260
Right.

00:32:41.260 --> 00:32:42.801
But it would indicate
somewhere in it

00:32:42.801 --> 00:32:44.800
that you were a
Japanese resident?

00:32:44.800 --> 00:32:45.430
That's right.

00:32:45.430 --> 00:32:46.690
You're a permanent resident
and you have the right

00:32:46.690 --> 00:32:48.940
to travel because you have
a South Korean passport,

00:32:48.940 --> 00:32:52.220
and South Korea and Japan
have a normalization treaty.

00:32:52.220 --> 00:32:54.160
And consequently,
they can travel.

00:32:54.160 --> 00:32:57.490
However, they're not
really South Koreans.

00:32:57.490 --> 00:33:02.200
I mean, most of them
don't speak Korean.

00:33:02.200 --> 00:33:06.490
And it's one of the elements
in the novel is that over time,

00:33:06.490 --> 00:33:09.070
the languages that people
write, the language that people

00:33:09.070 --> 00:33:10.480
write and speak changes.

00:33:10.480 --> 00:33:13.670
And so Noa, for
example, becomes--

00:33:13.670 --> 00:33:15.660
I mean, he tries to
become fully Japanese.

00:33:15.660 --> 00:33:16.675
He even passes.

00:33:16.675 --> 00:33:17.960
He even tells people.

00:33:17.960 --> 00:33:22.210
He tells his own wife and his
children that he's Japanese.

00:33:22.210 --> 00:33:25.182
But then it's noted, which I've
also found interesting that--

00:33:25.182 --> 00:33:26.890
That's actually quite
common, by the way.

00:33:26.890 --> 00:33:29.120
The people around him--

00:33:29.120 --> 00:33:30.870
I don't want to give
any of the plot away.

00:33:30.870 --> 00:33:34.125
But later on say, oh I
suspected that he might be

00:33:34.125 --> 00:33:36.260
or I thought that he might be.

00:33:36.260 --> 00:33:40.420
So I mean, that even that
is an element of society.

00:33:40.420 --> 00:33:41.020
Even today.

00:33:41.020 --> 00:33:43.580
There's a kind of murmuring
that's always going on.

00:33:43.580 --> 00:33:45.250
I think she's really Korean.

00:33:45.250 --> 00:33:47.492
Well, you know, she's Korean.

00:33:47.492 --> 00:33:49.450
And then all of a sudden,
that sort of explains

00:33:49.450 --> 00:33:52.640
why she's tacky or wears
too much glitter or I mean,

00:33:52.640 --> 00:33:54.640
whatever it is there's
something wrong with you,

00:33:54.640 --> 00:33:57.730
it can be explained by,
well, you know, she's Korean.

00:33:57.730 --> 00:33:59.060
She talks too much.

00:33:59.060 --> 00:34:00.010
She's Korean.

00:34:00.010 --> 00:34:01.210
She's too aggressive.

00:34:01.210 --> 00:34:02.380
She's Korean.

00:34:02.380 --> 00:34:04.780
So it's really quite
shocking, because I

00:34:04.780 --> 00:34:06.990
didn't know these negative
stereotypes existed

00:34:06.990 --> 00:34:09.060
about the Koreans
until I went to Japan.

00:34:09.060 --> 00:34:11.760
Because in America, you have
the other false stereotype

00:34:11.760 --> 00:34:12.730
of the model minority.

00:34:12.730 --> 00:34:14.242
Like I'm really good at math.

00:34:14.242 --> 00:34:16.540
I'm not.

00:34:16.540 --> 00:34:17.880
I'm really hard working.

00:34:17.880 --> 00:34:18.780
Sometimes.

00:34:18.780 --> 00:34:20.100
Not on everything.

00:34:20.100 --> 00:34:20.840
Whatever it is.

00:34:20.840 --> 00:34:22.469
You have these
false stereotypes.

00:34:22.469 --> 00:34:24.840
But then in Japan,
Koreans are considered

00:34:24.840 --> 00:34:29.848
criminal, deceitful,
aggressive, agitators.

00:34:29.848 --> 00:34:31.889
Very often that's the
thing that always comes up.

00:34:31.889 --> 00:34:33.560
Agitators.

00:34:33.560 --> 00:34:35.820
They stir up trouble.

00:34:35.820 --> 00:34:38.250
I'm a little proud of that one.

00:34:38.250 --> 00:34:41.159
Well, maybe we need to send
some Korean Japanese this way

00:34:41.159 --> 00:34:43.770
to stir up some trouble
in this country.

00:34:43.770 --> 00:34:45.520
I don't know.

00:34:45.520 --> 00:34:47.010
But I'm curious.

00:34:47.010 --> 00:34:48.989
So way back in 1980--

00:34:48.989 --> 00:34:49.489
Nine.

00:34:49.489 --> 00:34:52.949
Nine when you heard this
missionary speak and you

00:34:52.949 --> 00:34:56.820
discovered something
about your nation's

00:34:56.820 --> 00:35:01.710
past and present that you
hadn't known, or your parents--

00:35:01.710 --> 00:35:07.080
so did you go home and say,
mom, dad, what's up with this?

00:35:07.080 --> 00:35:08.430
I don't have those parents.

00:35:08.430 --> 00:35:09.210
No.

00:35:09.210 --> 00:35:12.510
I didn't talk
about it with them.

00:35:12.510 --> 00:35:15.120
My father is a war refugee.

00:35:15.120 --> 00:35:18.870
So he lost his whole
family in 1950.

00:35:18.870 --> 00:35:23.910
He was 16 and he was sent away
by his mother with his older

00:35:23.910 --> 00:35:28.020
half brother to the south
saying, go away for a few days,

00:35:28.020 --> 00:35:29.520
because a communist
army is coming,

00:35:29.520 --> 00:35:31.360
and they're doing
a sweep of boys.

00:35:31.360 --> 00:35:32.910
So you need to get out of here.

00:35:32.910 --> 00:35:34.410
And somehow through
her connections,

00:35:34.410 --> 00:35:36.319
he got passage in
an American ship,

00:35:36.319 --> 00:35:37.860
and he was sent all
the way to Pusan.

00:35:37.860 --> 00:35:40.193
He thought he was going to
be gone for three days, maybe

00:35:40.193 --> 00:35:41.370
a week tops.

00:35:41.370 --> 00:35:42.870
He never saw his parents again.

00:35:42.870 --> 00:35:44.119
He never saw his mother again.

00:35:44.119 --> 00:35:46.170
He never saw his sisters again.

00:35:46.170 --> 00:35:48.550
Anybody or his home.

00:35:48.550 --> 00:35:51.190
He was 16, and he kind of
made his life that way.

00:35:51.190 --> 00:35:54.780
So when he told us
stories about his past,

00:35:54.780 --> 00:35:57.960
it was almost like this
kind of picaresque, oh,

00:35:57.960 --> 00:36:01.200
and then I sold food in the
street and I became a pirate.

00:36:01.200 --> 00:36:02.940
My father was actually
a fabric pirate

00:36:02.940 --> 00:36:05.240
at one point in his life.

00:36:05.240 --> 00:36:09.540
Because it was illegal to
sell certain kinds of fabrics

00:36:09.540 --> 00:36:11.040
after the war.

00:36:11.040 --> 00:36:12.750
Because you had this
American government

00:36:12.750 --> 00:36:15.539
that would take over
both Korea and Japan

00:36:15.539 --> 00:36:17.580
and they had all these
rules about certain things

00:36:17.580 --> 00:36:18.660
that you couldn't trade.

00:36:18.660 --> 00:36:20.430
So he would go to
Japan, buy this fabric,

00:36:20.430 --> 00:36:24.180
and then sell it in South Korea.

00:36:24.180 --> 00:36:26.860
And then so he would make a
profit and things like that.

00:36:26.860 --> 00:36:28.680
So he had a lot
of ventures going.

00:36:28.680 --> 00:36:31.720
And he's a very
resourceful person.

00:36:31.720 --> 00:36:33.390
So I would hear
stories about that,

00:36:33.390 --> 00:36:35.610
very sort of
uplifting, positive,

00:36:35.610 --> 00:36:37.470
you can solve your problems.

00:36:37.470 --> 00:36:40.200
But we didn't get a lot
of big historical stories

00:36:40.200 --> 00:36:43.350
of how Korea, in many
ways, was humiliated.

00:36:43.350 --> 00:36:45.870
And I think that very often,
Korean families do not

00:36:45.870 --> 00:36:48.510
like to talk about
this aspect, because it

00:36:48.510 --> 00:36:51.300
was such a painful period.

00:36:51.300 --> 00:36:54.180
And the stories of
resistance, they do exist,

00:36:54.180 --> 00:36:57.110
but most kids don't know them.

00:36:57.110 --> 00:37:01.120
Do you think in
retrospect that that sense

00:37:01.120 --> 00:37:04.230
of untold stories
even growing up

00:37:04.230 --> 00:37:10.030
was part of what drove
you to be a writer?

00:37:10.030 --> 00:37:11.890
I definitely think
that all of us

00:37:11.890 --> 00:37:16.090
suffer from the untold
stories in our families.

00:37:16.090 --> 00:37:17.710
And I think sometimes
you can even

00:37:17.710 --> 00:37:20.530
look at people acting out
because there some secret two

00:37:20.530 --> 00:37:21.430
generations ago.

00:37:21.430 --> 00:37:23.020
I really believe in
all of that stuff

00:37:23.020 --> 00:37:26.950
about intergenerational
trauma being carried down

00:37:26.950 --> 00:37:27.970
in our cells.

00:37:27.970 --> 00:37:29.720
I really, really believe that.

00:37:29.720 --> 00:37:30.910
Somebody was explaining.

00:37:30.910 --> 00:37:33.520
I was at a talk
just the other day

00:37:33.520 --> 00:37:35.605
at the LA Festival of Books.

00:37:35.605 --> 00:37:37.480
Forgive me, because
there's probably somebody

00:37:37.480 --> 00:37:39.160
here in this room
who did the research.

00:37:39.160 --> 00:37:46.210
But something where
with mice they--

00:37:46.210 --> 00:37:47.890
what was it that
they associated?

00:37:47.890 --> 00:37:52.150
Was it the scent of cherry
blossoms was associated with--

00:37:52.150 --> 00:37:55.240
they did something to the mice
that made the mice terrified.

00:37:55.240 --> 00:37:59.380
And three generations
later of mice, the mice

00:37:59.380 --> 00:38:02.770
were terrified by the
scent of cherry blossoms.

00:38:02.770 --> 00:38:06.850
Which is actually, I guess
that's scientific proof.

00:38:06.850 --> 00:38:07.850
Well, I think so.

00:38:07.850 --> 00:38:10.630
And I think there's a part of
us that has these questions.

00:38:10.630 --> 00:38:12.700
Why am I afraid of this?

00:38:12.700 --> 00:38:14.650
Why does this upset me?

00:38:14.650 --> 00:38:17.170
And it's not that every
child that you have

00:38:17.170 --> 00:38:18.550
is going to be upset by it.

00:38:18.550 --> 00:38:21.430
But you will have one child
somewhere in the family who

00:38:21.430 --> 00:38:22.420
really wants to know.

00:38:22.420 --> 00:38:25.420
And I think I became really
obsessed with this idea

00:38:25.420 --> 00:38:28.210
that children
could hate children

00:38:28.210 --> 00:38:30.040
and that a social norm
could be constructed

00:38:30.040 --> 00:38:32.450
that would say that it's
OK to hate those children,

00:38:32.450 --> 00:38:36.010
that somehow those children
were dirty or criminal or

00:38:36.010 --> 00:38:36.640
untrustworthy.

00:38:36.640 --> 00:38:38.140
You can't have them
into your house,

00:38:38.140 --> 00:38:41.260
because they would somehow
contaminate the furniture.

00:38:41.260 --> 00:38:43.810
I heard so many stories
from the Korean Japanese

00:38:43.810 --> 00:38:48.070
where they weren't allowed to
go to their friends' homes.

00:38:48.070 --> 00:38:51.460
Or if you fell in love with
somebody who was Japanese,

00:38:51.460 --> 00:38:53.380
then you couldn't
get married and you

00:38:53.380 --> 00:38:54.800
couldn't meet their families.

00:38:54.800 --> 00:38:58.070
So I did, I don't know, dozens
upon dozens of interviews.

00:38:58.070 --> 00:39:00.320
And I would ask questions
like, oh, what do you think?

00:39:00.320 --> 00:39:02.020
Do you think
discrimination exists?

00:39:02.020 --> 00:39:05.116
I would just be plain old
American asking this question.

00:39:05.116 --> 00:39:06.490
And they would
say, oh, depending

00:39:06.490 --> 00:39:09.640
upon which affiliation,
North Korean, South Korean,

00:39:09.640 --> 00:39:12.400
or legally Japanese, they
would have different answers.

00:39:12.400 --> 00:39:15.387
But very often I would
have them say, oh no, no.

00:39:15.387 --> 00:39:16.720
Things are really good in Japan.

00:39:16.720 --> 00:39:18.100
I really love it here.

00:39:18.100 --> 00:39:21.310
And they just really didn't
want to cause any trouble.

00:39:21.310 --> 00:39:24.370
But then about 45
minutes into the lunch,

00:39:24.370 --> 00:39:27.970
they would tell me a story
about how they fell in love.

00:39:27.970 --> 00:39:30.460
It was always a love story.

00:39:30.460 --> 00:39:34.030
So interpersonal discrimination
is always so interesting,

00:39:34.030 --> 00:39:38.780
because they reject you
for really who you are.

00:39:38.780 --> 00:39:42.230
So they're saying that I am
willing to have sex with you,

00:39:42.230 --> 00:39:45.530
but I can't present
you to other people.

00:39:45.530 --> 00:39:50.970
That kind of social rejection
and sexual objectification

00:39:50.970 --> 00:39:54.920
is so traumatic for people
that they kind of repress it

00:39:54.920 --> 00:39:57.560
as kind of an
anecdote after saying

00:39:57.560 --> 00:39:59.510
in a kind of blanket
statement, no, no,

00:39:59.510 --> 00:40:00.996
discrimination doesn't exist.

00:40:00.996 --> 00:40:02.870
And I'd be like, well,
isn't that interesting

00:40:02.870 --> 00:40:07.010
how that family wouldn't meet
with you because you're Korean?

00:40:07.010 --> 00:40:10.010
And they would say, yes,
but you know, I understand.

00:40:10.010 --> 00:40:12.600
We have different cultures
and that's why it's not OK.

00:40:15.700 --> 00:40:19.070
It's interesting though, because
even as you're telling me this,

00:40:19.070 --> 00:40:21.205
I feel that perhaps less--

00:40:24.040 --> 00:40:27.810
I hope much less in the United
States than 30 or 50 years ago.

00:40:27.810 --> 00:40:31.060
But certainly in the past, this
happened in the United States

00:40:31.060 --> 00:40:36.422
all the time, and it
still to some degree does.

00:40:36.422 --> 00:40:38.380
I had friends of mine
who are white Anglo-Saxon

00:40:38.380 --> 00:40:42.070
Protestant who grew up
in upstate New York.

00:40:42.070 --> 00:40:44.170
And he was very well
off and he said across

00:40:44.170 --> 00:40:48.130
the street were these very
lovely Jewish families.

00:40:48.130 --> 00:40:51.340
And he said he wasn't
allowed to talk to them.

00:40:51.340 --> 00:40:54.080
He's only like 65.

00:40:54.080 --> 00:40:56.380
So that's not a
very long time ago.

00:40:56.380 --> 00:40:56.940
No.

00:40:56.940 --> 00:40:59.415
Well, I remember when I--

00:40:59.415 --> 00:41:00.660
But it troubled him.

00:41:00.660 --> 00:41:02.480
He was like, why
can't I talk to them?

00:41:02.480 --> 00:41:04.010
But his parents said, you
can't talk to those kids

00:41:04.010 --> 00:41:04.968
because they're Jewish.

00:41:04.968 --> 00:41:06.440
And he's like why?

00:41:06.440 --> 00:41:08.000
There was no why.

00:41:08.000 --> 00:41:09.690
He just couldn't do it.

00:41:09.690 --> 00:41:11.600
And that kind of
information is so hard

00:41:11.600 --> 00:41:15.290
to comprehend and
accept, obviously.

00:41:15.290 --> 00:41:18.470
One of the things that comes up
in the later part of the novel

00:41:18.470 --> 00:41:20.450
is that Solomon gets
a girlfriend who

00:41:20.450 --> 00:41:22.320
is Korean American.

00:41:22.320 --> 00:41:23.000
Yes.

00:41:23.000 --> 00:41:29.450
And I mean, the divide between
their cultural experiences

00:41:29.450 --> 00:41:30.695
is pretty profound.

00:41:30.695 --> 00:41:31.320
Huge.

00:41:31.320 --> 00:41:33.470
And problematic.

00:41:33.470 --> 00:41:35.720
Is that something--
Did you feel as you--

00:41:35.720 --> 00:41:37.460
I mean, you were
compelled by this story.

00:41:37.460 --> 00:41:40.550
Did you also feel
that in some way

00:41:40.550 --> 00:41:43.820
this novel is bringing the news?

00:41:43.820 --> 00:41:47.915
That you're opening the eyes
of all ignorant Americans,

00:41:47.915 --> 00:41:50.866
but including Korean
Americans in this country?

00:41:50.866 --> 00:41:52.490
Well, I don't think
anyone is ignorant.

00:41:52.490 --> 00:41:55.700
I mean, ignorance makes it
seem as if we consciously

00:41:55.700 --> 00:41:56.780
try not to learn it.

00:41:56.780 --> 00:41:57.812
It's just not taught.

00:41:57.812 --> 00:42:00.020
It's kind of like when you
look at a biology textbook

00:42:00.020 --> 00:42:04.800
today versus when I took
biology 35 years ago.

00:42:04.800 --> 00:42:05.970
Wow.

00:42:05.970 --> 00:42:09.650
[LAUGHS] It was a
much slimmer book.

00:42:09.650 --> 00:42:12.105
There's all of this stuff
that happened in biology.

00:42:12.105 --> 00:42:13.730
The idea of genetics,
which was kind of

00:42:13.730 --> 00:42:15.475
like a cute idea in 1985.

00:42:15.475 --> 00:42:17.690
Now it's like, genetics.

00:42:17.690 --> 00:42:19.580
So it's like that with history.

00:42:19.580 --> 00:42:21.840
There's so much more history
that we need to know.

00:42:21.840 --> 00:42:23.548
So people are constantly
making decisions

00:42:23.548 --> 00:42:25.040
about what can we teach.

00:42:25.040 --> 00:42:28.610
What is really troubling to
me is the Eurocentric nature

00:42:28.610 --> 00:42:31.940
of the way history
is taught when

00:42:31.940 --> 00:42:33.800
the arenas and the
theaters of where

00:42:33.800 --> 00:42:35.930
historical conflicts
and political conflicts

00:42:35.930 --> 00:42:39.440
are taking place today
are not just Europe.

00:42:39.440 --> 00:42:43.280
So the fact that we know
nothing about the Middle East.

00:42:43.280 --> 00:42:45.530
It's shocking how little we
know about the Middle East

00:42:45.530 --> 00:42:47.290
or how we know so
little about Asia

00:42:47.290 --> 00:42:49.970
when almost all
the Cold War proxy

00:42:49.970 --> 00:42:52.200
wars took place in
the theater of Asia

00:42:52.200 --> 00:42:54.080
and still we don't know.

00:42:54.080 --> 00:42:54.920
And it's not taught.

00:42:54.920 --> 00:42:57.410
So I kind of think it should
be kind of like genetics.

00:42:57.410 --> 00:43:01.840
It should be moved a bit more
center when we teach history.

00:43:01.840 --> 00:43:03.680
I think we would
all benefit from it.

00:43:03.680 --> 00:43:06.320
I think our policymakers
would benefit from it.

00:43:06.320 --> 00:43:08.620
I think our policymakers
would benefit from it.

00:43:08.620 --> 00:43:10.820
[LAUGHTER]

00:43:10.820 --> 00:43:13.850
I'm interested, because
I read an interview

00:43:13.850 --> 00:43:17.210
where you said you had
no intention, I mean,

00:43:17.210 --> 00:43:19.560
that you didn't want to
read a historical novel.

00:43:19.560 --> 00:43:20.060
No.

00:43:20.060 --> 00:43:20.900
It's really hard.

00:43:20.900 --> 00:43:24.260
I read something else that said
that the first version started

00:43:24.260 --> 00:43:25.520
in the '70s.

00:43:25.520 --> 00:43:27.710
So what happened?

00:43:27.710 --> 00:43:29.630
Well, I interviewed
all these people

00:43:29.630 --> 00:43:31.970
who were like Solomon in Japan.

00:43:31.970 --> 00:43:33.650
I interviewed all
these Korean Japanese

00:43:33.650 --> 00:43:34.860
who worked in Wall Street.

00:43:34.860 --> 00:43:37.790
So I met these guys from
Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley

00:43:37.790 --> 00:43:39.710
and all these other
really fancy banks.

00:43:39.710 --> 00:43:42.230
Really very good
looking, very well

00:43:42.230 --> 00:43:45.320
put together young
people who worked,

00:43:45.320 --> 00:43:47.960
who were kind of
basically Solomon avatars.

00:43:47.960 --> 00:43:53.570
And I talked to them and I
thought, you are so boring.

00:43:53.570 --> 00:43:57.380
You cannot carry a long novel.

00:43:57.380 --> 00:44:00.860
You can definitely carry
two to three chapters.

00:44:00.860 --> 00:44:02.819
Right?

00:44:02.819 --> 00:44:04.610
And I'd like you for
two to three chapters,

00:44:04.610 --> 00:44:08.442
but I don't think I would
inflict that on you, Claire.

00:44:08.442 --> 00:44:09.650
And I think about this a lot.

00:44:09.650 --> 00:44:12.740
I think about how things
should be interesting.

00:44:12.740 --> 00:44:16.190
The people that I want you to
meet should be interesting.

00:44:16.190 --> 00:44:18.050
And very often
what I realized was

00:44:18.050 --> 00:44:19.627
that it wasn't that
those characters,

00:44:19.627 --> 00:44:21.710
the people that I interviewed
weren't interesting.

00:44:21.710 --> 00:44:25.700
It's that they had such
incredible polish and grooming

00:44:25.700 --> 00:44:30.110
that they had lost
something of a rawness.

00:44:30.110 --> 00:44:34.100
And I needed to figure out,
why did you lose your rawness?

00:44:34.100 --> 00:44:36.610
Who told you that you
couldn't have it anymore?

00:44:36.610 --> 00:44:38.360
And I think in these
kinds of environments

00:44:38.360 --> 00:44:41.150
where we're very elite and
polished and successful,

00:44:41.150 --> 00:44:46.580
it's really scary to cry and to
be upset and to have troubles.

00:44:46.580 --> 00:44:50.000
To say I don't have money
or that I don't have access

00:44:50.000 --> 00:44:52.100
or that I got rejected.

00:44:52.100 --> 00:44:54.290
Those things make
people really nervous.

00:44:54.290 --> 00:44:56.880
Aren't we supposed to
be having a good time?

00:44:56.880 --> 00:44:59.870
And I think that when I
met these young people who

00:44:59.870 --> 00:45:03.590
were already so successful,
so launched so early in life,

00:45:03.590 --> 00:45:05.570
they weren't willing
to talk about what

00:45:05.570 --> 00:45:07.460
really was upsetting them.

00:45:07.460 --> 00:45:10.580
So then invariably I
realized, oh, they're

00:45:10.580 --> 00:45:14.330
this way because they have had
to carry so much of the pain

00:45:14.330 --> 00:45:15.722
of the other generations.

00:45:15.722 --> 00:45:17.180
And I thought, oh
my god, I'm going

00:45:17.180 --> 00:45:20.040
to have to write a
historical novel.

00:45:20.040 --> 00:45:21.000
So I did.

00:45:21.000 --> 00:45:23.810
But it took me freaking forever.

00:45:23.810 --> 00:45:26.330
So you had how many versions?

00:45:26.330 --> 00:45:28.760
This is the-- because
there was the first one

00:45:28.760 --> 00:45:29.760
that you wrote from '96.

00:45:29.760 --> 00:45:32.030
Which is garbage now.

00:45:32.030 --> 00:45:34.820
Part that I read is
something that I saved.

00:45:34.820 --> 00:45:38.720
So what percentage
overlap would you say?

00:45:38.720 --> 00:45:41.291
Five.

00:45:41.291 --> 00:45:41.790
Right.

00:45:41.790 --> 00:45:42.331
So and then--

00:45:42.331 --> 00:45:44.220
[INAUDIBLE] didn't exist.

00:45:44.220 --> 00:45:45.080
Moses didn't exist.

00:45:45.080 --> 00:45:46.680
Noa didn't exist.

00:45:46.680 --> 00:45:51.680
Sunja was born in Japan
in 2008 in my mind.

00:45:51.680 --> 00:45:52.640
Wow.

00:45:52.640 --> 00:45:54.475
She's pretty important
in this book.

00:45:54.475 --> 00:45:55.350
Well, she carries it.

00:45:55.350 --> 00:45:56.100
She's [INAUDIBLE].

00:45:56.100 --> 00:45:57.460
Exactly.

00:45:57.460 --> 00:45:58.400
And Hansu.

00:45:58.400 --> 00:45:59.050
And Hansu.

00:45:59.050 --> 00:46:00.745
He didn't exist either.

00:46:00.745 --> 00:46:02.645
Wow.

00:46:02.645 --> 00:46:03.600
Wow.

00:46:03.600 --> 00:46:04.470
I know.

00:46:04.470 --> 00:46:05.930
So it was a very different book.

00:46:05.930 --> 00:46:07.110
A very, very different book.

00:46:07.110 --> 00:46:11.650
And I was so happy when
I found these characters.

00:46:11.650 --> 00:46:12.150
How did you?

00:46:12.150 --> 00:46:14.036
Did they just come to you?

00:46:14.036 --> 00:46:15.660
Was it from stories
that you were told?

00:46:15.660 --> 00:46:19.380
It was all the interviews,
photographs, archival research.

00:46:19.380 --> 00:46:21.180
So Hansu came out
of a photograph

00:46:21.180 --> 00:46:24.240
that I saw, a black and white
photograph of fish brokers.

00:46:24.240 --> 00:46:27.990
And there was this guy
wearing a white linen suit.

00:46:27.990 --> 00:46:30.260
He's a fish broker.

00:46:30.260 --> 00:46:31.950
And white patent leather shoes.

00:46:31.950 --> 00:46:33.990
And it said he's an
important fish broker.

00:46:33.990 --> 00:46:36.090
And I was like, there's my guy.

00:46:36.090 --> 00:46:36.840
There's my guy.

00:46:36.840 --> 00:46:39.795
Because imagine everybody
else is filthy and smelly,

00:46:39.795 --> 00:46:42.600
but he's looking pristine.

00:46:42.600 --> 00:46:44.830
And you guys are
probably too young,

00:46:44.830 --> 00:46:46.290
but remember Fantasy Island?

00:46:46.290 --> 00:46:47.100
I do.

00:46:47.100 --> 00:46:48.060
Ricardo Montalban.

00:46:48.060 --> 00:46:48.560
Right.

00:46:48.560 --> 00:46:49.630
He was like Mr. Roarke.

00:46:49.630 --> 00:46:52.590
And I was like, Mr.
Roarke is in Korea.

00:46:52.590 --> 00:46:54.630
I'm going to write about him.

00:46:54.630 --> 00:46:55.830
And what about her?

00:46:55.830 --> 00:46:56.940
Where did she come from?

00:46:56.940 --> 00:46:58.980
She came from the markets.

00:46:58.980 --> 00:47:00.810
So I did a lot of
market research.

00:47:00.810 --> 00:47:01.763
Not market research.

00:47:01.763 --> 00:47:02.846
But I went to [INAUDIBLE].

00:47:02.846 --> 00:47:05.960
I was like, that's
actually a term, isn't it?

00:47:05.960 --> 00:47:07.095
No.

00:47:07.095 --> 00:47:08.550
Some sort of UX experience.

00:47:08.550 --> 00:47:12.060
So I went to the
markets, the open markets

00:47:12.060 --> 00:47:14.010
where Koreans were working.

00:47:14.010 --> 00:47:16.620
And I looked at all these
ajummas, these sort of women

00:47:16.620 --> 00:47:18.030
who work in these markets.

00:47:18.030 --> 00:47:25.810
And they were so feisty
and funny and resourceful.

00:47:25.810 --> 00:47:28.140
I would interview
them about things

00:47:28.140 --> 00:47:29.670
and they would
kind of look at me

00:47:29.670 --> 00:47:32.610
like, why are you bothering me?

00:47:32.610 --> 00:47:35.206
And they had this kind of, they
were just going to fix stuff

00:47:35.206 --> 00:47:37.080
and they were going to
get on with their day,

00:47:37.080 --> 00:47:40.830
and they would not be disturbed
by the likes of me or anything

00:47:40.830 --> 00:47:41.710
else.

00:47:41.710 --> 00:47:43.410
And they also had
this vulnerability.

00:47:43.410 --> 00:47:47.580
Because at one point,
I tried to pretend

00:47:47.580 --> 00:47:49.620
to be one of those people.

00:47:49.620 --> 00:47:52.680
So I would to the markets and
I would sort of stand there.

00:47:52.680 --> 00:47:55.320
And you realize just
how terrifying it is.

00:47:55.320 --> 00:47:57.810
Because you don't have walls.

00:47:57.810 --> 00:47:59.460
You're just in the stall.

00:47:59.460 --> 00:48:01.507
And you have something
in front of you.

00:48:01.507 --> 00:48:03.090
And somehow you have
to sell the thing

00:48:03.090 --> 00:48:04.900
that you have in front of you.

00:48:04.900 --> 00:48:07.060
And anybody could approach you.

00:48:07.060 --> 00:48:09.810
And you can't go
to the bathroom.

00:48:09.810 --> 00:48:11.670
You just can't just
leave your stuff.

00:48:11.670 --> 00:48:14.070
So you have all these kind
of diurnal requirements

00:48:14.070 --> 00:48:15.630
of being a peddler.

00:48:15.630 --> 00:48:19.770
And doing that
for a while really

00:48:19.770 --> 00:48:26.390
made me realize just how
convenient my life is.

00:48:26.390 --> 00:48:27.650
I have doors.

00:48:27.650 --> 00:48:29.150
I could close my door.

00:48:29.150 --> 00:48:29.840
Bathrooms.

00:48:29.840 --> 00:48:31.970
I could go to a clean bathroom.

00:48:31.970 --> 00:48:36.200
I mean, a clean
bathroom is a big deal.

00:48:36.200 --> 00:48:37.790
To not have deal
with the scents.

00:48:37.790 --> 00:48:39.680
The smells were so overwhelming.

00:48:39.680 --> 00:48:41.320
What'd you sell?

00:48:41.320 --> 00:48:43.392
Oh, I didn't actually
sell anything.

00:48:43.392 --> 00:48:45.350
Well, I mean, I've worked
in my parents' store.

00:48:45.350 --> 00:48:46.610
So I have that experience.

00:48:46.610 --> 00:48:48.080
But they had a
little tiny store.

00:48:48.080 --> 00:48:49.610
So I know what
that's like to work

00:48:49.610 --> 00:48:50.310
in that kind of environment.

00:48:50.310 --> 00:48:52.640
So when you were pretending to
be one of those [INAUDIBLE]??

00:48:52.640 --> 00:48:54.020
I would just sort of
stand there and then

00:48:54.020 --> 00:48:55.910
I would try to figure
out what they would do.

00:48:55.910 --> 00:48:58.310
And just that feeling
of standing there

00:48:58.310 --> 00:49:00.020
beside these women.

00:49:00.020 --> 00:49:03.980
And also you're working
while you're selling.

00:49:03.980 --> 00:49:05.487
So you're frying
dough and you're

00:49:05.487 --> 00:49:07.070
covering it up with
something and then

00:49:07.070 --> 00:49:08.540
you have to find packaging.

00:49:08.540 --> 00:49:10.670
Even something like
packaging was something

00:49:10.670 --> 00:49:11.780
that I didn't understand.

00:49:11.780 --> 00:49:14.090
But of course that makes sense.

00:49:14.090 --> 00:49:17.030
When you get a cup of
coffee at some place,

00:49:17.030 --> 00:49:18.110
they have a paper cup.

00:49:18.110 --> 00:49:21.300
But if you're selling
something at that moment,

00:49:21.300 --> 00:49:25.630
you don't have these
convenient disposable packages.

00:49:25.630 --> 00:49:27.800
Right.

00:49:27.800 --> 00:49:29.571
You couldn't have
learned it from a book?

00:49:29.571 --> 00:49:30.070
No.

00:49:30.070 --> 00:49:31.160
No, no.

00:49:31.160 --> 00:49:33.410
I want to ask you too
about Christianity.

00:49:33.410 --> 00:49:39.410
And it's very important
to the characters and down

00:49:39.410 --> 00:49:42.860
through the generations also.

00:49:42.860 --> 00:49:44.920
It's in their names, right?

00:49:44.920 --> 00:49:48.680
It's something that people
know immediately about them.

00:49:48.680 --> 00:49:51.230
And I wonder what--

00:49:51.230 --> 00:49:53.680
you yourself are a Christian,
your family's Christian.

00:49:53.680 --> 00:49:54.840
I'm Presbyterian.

00:49:57.400 --> 00:50:00.460
Because I know that Casey
Han is Christian too.

00:50:00.460 --> 00:50:01.800
And she's agnostic.

00:50:01.800 --> 00:50:02.300
Right.

00:50:02.300 --> 00:50:07.040
But she comes from a
very religious family.

00:50:07.040 --> 00:50:11.270
And I think it was something
that I was wondering about

00:50:11.270 --> 00:50:14.630
as I was reading
the novel is how

00:50:14.630 --> 00:50:17.090
much a particular
experience that is

00:50:17.090 --> 00:50:20.100
within the Korean
Japanese experience.

00:50:20.100 --> 00:50:24.200
What percentage of that
population is Christian

00:50:24.200 --> 00:50:27.830
and what are the particular
trials that people--

00:50:27.830 --> 00:50:30.470
I mean, some of them
are in the novel.

00:50:30.470 --> 00:50:34.910
And how and why that's
important to you novelistically.

00:50:34.910 --> 00:50:39.410
Oh, it's important
historically and politically.

00:50:39.410 --> 00:50:42.890
So when I learned about
the story of the Koreans

00:50:42.890 --> 00:50:46.950
in Japan and my anxiety
about missionaries,

00:50:46.950 --> 00:50:49.625
I came out of a very
clear political stance

00:50:49.625 --> 00:50:52.190
that I had as a
progressive person.

00:50:52.190 --> 00:50:54.340
So I felt very defensive.

00:50:54.340 --> 00:50:56.346
I didn't think that
Koreans were savages that

00:50:56.346 --> 00:50:57.470
needed to be Christianized.

00:50:57.470 --> 00:50:59.789
So I had this kind
of, my back was up.

00:50:59.789 --> 00:51:01.580
And then the more I
studied Korean history,

00:51:01.580 --> 00:51:03.140
I realized I'm an idiot.

00:51:03.140 --> 00:51:08.390
Because Christianity has been
part of the Korean peninsula

00:51:08.390 --> 00:51:11.750
since actually the 14th century.

00:51:11.750 --> 00:51:15.110
And if you look at the
end of the 19th century

00:51:15.110 --> 00:51:18.750
and the 20th century of
the peninsula of Korea,

00:51:18.750 --> 00:51:22.070
there were so many aspects
of Christianity which

00:51:22.070 --> 00:51:24.170
affected the caste system.

00:51:24.170 --> 00:51:27.050
Because Korea had a very
unjust caste system.

00:51:27.050 --> 00:51:28.850
They even had
untouchables in Korea.

00:51:28.850 --> 00:51:31.250
So I'm sure there are
people in this audience who

00:51:31.250 --> 00:51:33.020
probably know better than I do.

00:51:33.020 --> 00:51:35.870
And what Christianity did,
this Western religion,

00:51:35.870 --> 00:51:37.670
was to break down
the caste system.

00:51:37.670 --> 00:51:39.500
Because they made this
idea that all of us

00:51:39.500 --> 00:51:41.624
are united as brothers
and sisters in Christ.

00:51:41.624 --> 00:51:43.790
So then all of a sudden,
you had to kind of rethink.

00:51:43.790 --> 00:51:47.310
It's like, oh, that person that
I can't talk to because they're

00:51:47.310 --> 00:51:49.820
[KOREAN],, which means
that they are untouchable

00:51:49.820 --> 00:51:53.000
and they work with the dead or
butchers or leather workers,

00:51:53.000 --> 00:51:54.519
you couldn't really
deal with them.

00:51:54.519 --> 00:51:56.060
You'd have to because
you're supposed

00:51:56.060 --> 00:51:58.190
to worship the same God.

00:51:58.190 --> 00:52:00.440
The other radical thing
that was important to me

00:52:00.440 --> 00:52:02.540
is the education of women.

00:52:02.540 --> 00:52:05.090
Because you could be
very high born in Korea

00:52:05.090 --> 00:52:08.630
and still in the Yi
dynasty you could not

00:52:08.630 --> 00:52:10.940
learn how to go-- you
couldn't go to school.

00:52:10.940 --> 00:52:15.650
So if any of you here have
a grandparent, a grandmother

00:52:15.650 --> 00:52:18.350
or a great grandmother,
who was literate,

00:52:18.350 --> 00:52:22.280
I could bet you $1,000
today that somehow they were

00:52:22.280 --> 00:52:25.520
attached to some missionary.

00:52:25.520 --> 00:52:27.110
There's no other way.

00:52:27.110 --> 00:52:29.859
Because whatever
class that she was in,

00:52:29.859 --> 00:52:31.650
she would not have been
encouraged to read.

00:52:31.650 --> 00:52:34.670
It would have been considered
really shameful to actually

00:52:34.670 --> 00:52:35.900
make your daughter read.

00:52:35.900 --> 00:52:36.830
What's your problem?

00:52:36.830 --> 00:52:38.870
Why would your daughter
know how to read?

00:52:38.870 --> 00:52:39.920
So that was important.

00:52:39.920 --> 00:52:44.150
So you have these two aspects
of breaking down castes,

00:52:44.150 --> 00:52:46.970
breaking down gender barriers
in education of women.

00:52:46.970 --> 00:52:50.120
And the other big thing
is that Christians

00:52:50.120 --> 00:52:53.390
were the big agitators against
the Japanese government

00:52:53.390 --> 00:52:56.030
and the colonialization
of Korea.

00:52:56.030 --> 00:53:00.020
And consequently, you have
this legacy of civil rights

00:53:00.020 --> 00:53:00.830
that occurred.

00:53:00.830 --> 00:53:05.960
And even today with the most
recent candlelight vigil,

00:53:05.960 --> 00:53:10.610
a lot of that has a kind of
a hat tipping to Catholicism.

00:53:10.610 --> 00:53:13.820
Because a lot of Catholic
priests were very involved

00:53:13.820 --> 00:53:15.890
in protecting union leaders.

00:53:15.890 --> 00:53:17.810
And if people were
taken into prison,

00:53:17.810 --> 00:53:20.090
they would often do
hostage negotiations

00:53:20.090 --> 00:53:23.240
to save the union agitators.

00:53:23.240 --> 00:53:28.657
And they would give them refuge
and sanctuary to union leaders

00:53:28.657 --> 00:53:29.990
who were fighting for democracy.

00:53:29.990 --> 00:53:34.550
Because the way Korea
has developed so quickly,

00:53:34.550 --> 00:53:38.030
there were some very
corrupt and unfair things

00:53:38.030 --> 00:53:41.630
that were done to the Korean
people by capitalists.

00:53:41.630 --> 00:53:43.820
And the government
worked very closely

00:53:43.820 --> 00:53:45.770
with the industrialists,
and therefore

00:53:45.770 --> 00:53:50.540
huge swathes of poor
Koreans were exploited.

00:53:50.540 --> 00:53:52.530
And very often,
churches were involved.

00:53:52.530 --> 00:53:54.800
So it's not to say that
churches are perfect.

00:53:54.800 --> 00:53:58.070
But you can't really erase
the role of Christianity

00:53:58.070 --> 00:53:59.220
in Korean history.

00:53:59.220 --> 00:54:01.790
So I'm going to
take people to task.

00:54:01.790 --> 00:54:03.770
So whenever I do meet
Koreans and they're

00:54:03.770 --> 00:54:05.360
talking about
Christianity and they're

00:54:05.360 --> 00:54:06.984
looking at it from
the lens of I looked

00:54:06.984 --> 00:54:10.310
at when I was 19 of just
having your [INAUDIBLE] saying,

00:54:10.310 --> 00:54:13.070
oh, you don't need
this Western religion.

00:54:13.070 --> 00:54:15.440
I think, actually, if
you study Korean history

00:54:15.440 --> 00:54:18.830
or you know Korean people,
Christianity is not

00:54:18.830 --> 00:54:20.690
necessarily always a bad thing.

00:54:20.690 --> 00:54:23.120
In the same way if you look
at the civil rights movement

00:54:23.120 --> 00:54:25.400
in America, the role of church.

00:54:25.400 --> 00:54:28.250
You can't take out the fact
that Dr. Martin Luther King

00:54:28.250 --> 00:54:31.340
Jr. was a minister.

00:54:31.340 --> 00:54:35.490
You can't take that away from
Representative John Lewis.

00:54:35.490 --> 00:54:37.070
He's actually a minister.

00:54:37.070 --> 00:54:40.670
So these theologies give
inspiration to people

00:54:40.670 --> 00:54:43.850
to do very, very
risky, scary things.

00:54:43.850 --> 00:54:47.400
So for me, I mean, we know
we have to study motivation.

00:54:47.400 --> 00:54:51.770
What motivates a character to do
things that are so terrifying?

00:54:51.770 --> 00:54:52.617
To have the courage.

00:54:52.617 --> 00:54:53.450
To have the courage.

00:54:53.450 --> 00:54:56.210
So I had to put that in.

00:54:56.210 --> 00:54:57.015
What about form?

00:54:59.570 --> 00:55:02.360
This is, in many
ways, reminiscent

00:55:02.360 --> 00:55:05.240
of a 19th century novel.

00:55:05.240 --> 00:55:08.450
In that sense, it's
immensely popular,

00:55:08.450 --> 00:55:14.330
but it could be unpopular,
because it isn't fashionable.

00:55:14.330 --> 00:55:17.470
Your novel isn't
fashionable in its approach.

00:55:17.470 --> 00:55:19.700
And I wondered--

00:55:19.700 --> 00:55:22.360
I remembered it must be--

00:55:22.360 --> 00:55:24.680
Claire Messud just said
my book's not fashionable.

00:55:24.680 --> 00:55:25.976
[LAUGHTER]

00:55:25.976 --> 00:55:27.350
Well, I'm not
fashionable either.

00:55:27.350 --> 00:55:29.040
No, but you're absolutely right.

00:55:29.040 --> 00:55:30.820
I've been told this a lot.

00:55:30.820 --> 00:55:36.900
But it must be 25 years ago, I
remember, maybe it's even 30,

00:55:36.900 --> 00:55:37.910
I was at a reading.

00:55:37.910 --> 00:55:40.935
Allan Gurganus, who wrote Oldest
Living Confederate Widow Tells

00:55:40.935 --> 00:55:43.310
All was reading from that
book, which was new then, which

00:55:43.310 --> 00:55:44.600
if you remember will date.

00:55:44.600 --> 00:55:45.890
I have a first edition.

00:55:45.890 --> 00:55:47.120
Which will date the novel.

00:55:47.120 --> 00:55:49.460
And he stood up and
he gave his reading

00:55:49.460 --> 00:55:51.219
and then he was talking.

00:55:51.219 --> 00:55:53.010
Somebody asked him
about the point of view.

00:55:53.010 --> 00:55:54.385
And he said, well,
of course it's

00:55:54.385 --> 00:55:57.800
the first person, because
the third person is finished.

00:55:57.800 --> 00:55:59.800
It's not possible
any longer to write

00:55:59.800 --> 00:56:01.050
in an omniscient third person.

00:56:01.050 --> 00:56:06.030
This has to do with the
fragmentation of our society.

00:56:06.030 --> 00:56:07.740
It has to do with
secularization.

00:56:07.740 --> 00:56:09.380
It has to do with our--

00:56:09.380 --> 00:56:10.250
God is dead.

00:56:10.250 --> 00:56:14.060
Loss of the faith in the divine.

00:56:14.060 --> 00:56:16.760
All we have is
subjectivity now, so all we

00:56:16.760 --> 00:56:18.170
have is the first person.

00:56:18.170 --> 00:56:22.050
I was very distressed by
that at age whatever, 23.

00:56:22.050 --> 00:56:23.780
Really, can that be?

00:56:23.780 --> 00:56:25.450
And I puzzled over
it for a long time.

00:56:25.450 --> 00:56:28.340
But it's certainly true that
anecdotally, you look around

00:56:28.340 --> 00:56:30.500
and I realize how few.

00:56:30.500 --> 00:56:34.400
And certainly you
speak to young writers.

00:56:34.400 --> 00:56:35.150
No one doing it.

00:56:35.150 --> 00:56:36.733
I prefer to write
in the first person.

00:56:36.733 --> 00:56:39.740
Or they do third person
shifting by chapters, which

00:56:39.740 --> 00:56:41.260
is basically first person.

00:56:41.260 --> 00:56:42.260
With [INAUDIBLE] style.

00:56:42.260 --> 00:56:42.760
Right.

00:56:45.510 --> 00:56:46.940
Or second person.

00:56:46.940 --> 00:56:48.390
Yes, occasionally second person.

00:56:48.390 --> 00:56:49.760
Which is also first person.

00:56:49.760 --> 00:56:51.360
Right, which is
also first person.

00:56:51.360 --> 00:56:54.940
And so the question is, did
it feel like a radical choice?

00:56:54.940 --> 00:56:58.820
Did it feel like
the only choice?

00:56:58.820 --> 00:57:00.870
Your other novel is also
in the third person.

00:57:00.870 --> 00:57:04.220
It's the only form that
I want to write in.

00:57:04.220 --> 00:57:07.760
And it's because the people
that I love to read so much

00:57:07.760 --> 00:57:10.310
were these omniscient narrators.

00:57:10.310 --> 00:57:11.660
And I like them.

00:57:11.660 --> 00:57:13.820
I love the idea that you
can create a book out

00:57:13.820 --> 00:57:15.860
of every person in this room.

00:57:15.860 --> 00:57:17.540
Every single person would--

00:57:17.540 --> 00:57:19.310
actually, my books
have enough space

00:57:19.310 --> 00:57:20.960
for everybody in this book.

00:57:20.960 --> 00:57:25.270
And maybe there will be
eight central characters.

00:57:25.270 --> 00:57:27.130
And somehow each of
you would somehow

00:57:27.130 --> 00:57:29.200
kinetically affect each other.

00:57:29.200 --> 00:57:32.410
In the same way, that's
how it works in life.

00:57:32.410 --> 00:57:35.500
And I wanted to have
that canvas and to have

00:57:35.500 --> 00:57:37.120
that kind of
freedom, because I'm

00:57:37.120 --> 00:57:39.190
interested in building a world.

00:57:39.190 --> 00:57:40.630
I'm a world builder.

00:57:40.630 --> 00:57:42.700
And that means that I
need to know everything

00:57:42.700 --> 00:57:43.810
about this entire world.

00:57:43.810 --> 00:57:46.270
But the thing that
really upsets me

00:57:46.270 --> 00:57:49.840
about the omniscient narration
is that it takes a long time

00:57:49.840 --> 00:57:53.530
to do it accurately
and to tell it honestly

00:57:53.530 --> 00:57:54.730
about people's roles.

00:57:54.730 --> 00:57:57.080
And I'm obsessed with work.

00:57:57.080 --> 00:57:59.700
So I'm constantly interviewing
people about their work.

00:57:59.700 --> 00:58:01.019
So when I meet a guy who can--

00:58:01.019 --> 00:58:02.810
It's another wonderful
thing in this novel.

00:58:02.810 --> 00:58:04.500
You learn a lot
about people's work.

00:58:04.500 --> 00:58:05.000
Right.

00:58:05.000 --> 00:58:05.506
I love work.

00:58:05.506 --> 00:58:06.880
So when I meet
somebody who knows

00:58:06.880 --> 00:58:10.810
how to fix the microphone,
I really want to know.

00:58:10.810 --> 00:58:12.310
Andy, what do you do?

00:58:12.310 --> 00:58:14.254
See, there's Andy back there.

00:58:14.254 --> 00:58:15.670
And how do you
know the difference

00:58:15.670 --> 00:58:18.460
between a lav versus a
stand mic versus a boom?

00:58:18.460 --> 00:58:20.440
I mean, I'm interested
in how that works,

00:58:20.440 --> 00:58:24.130
because that's how
we earn our living.

00:58:24.130 --> 00:58:26.050
And I want to
understand how we make

00:58:26.050 --> 00:58:28.150
a living, because
earning a living is

00:58:28.150 --> 00:58:30.310
how we get on with our day.

00:58:30.310 --> 00:58:33.400
So much of the way we
spend our time is work.

00:58:33.400 --> 00:58:34.990
And I'm interested
in it, and I'm

00:58:34.990 --> 00:58:36.940
interested in why
you chose that work

00:58:36.940 --> 00:58:38.730
or why that work chose you.

00:58:38.730 --> 00:58:41.050
And what happens when
you don't have that work?

00:58:41.050 --> 00:58:42.850
That's interesting too.

00:58:42.850 --> 00:58:45.790
So I'm interested in things
like love and betrayal

00:58:45.790 --> 00:58:47.929
and all those things
are so important.

00:58:47.929 --> 00:58:49.720
But I want to know how
you spend your time.

00:58:49.720 --> 00:58:51.820
And then I wanted
to write my comment

00:58:51.820 --> 00:58:55.330
on how we spend our time
and how we make our money

00:58:55.330 --> 00:58:59.860
and how we lose our money.

00:58:59.860 --> 00:59:02.850
So there are two questions.

00:59:02.850 --> 00:59:06.190
In time I want before too
long to open it up to others.

00:59:06.190 --> 00:59:09.550
But I want to ask
you about the title.

00:59:09.550 --> 00:59:15.540
But before we get to the
title, I want to ask you.

00:59:15.540 --> 00:59:17.900
You were saying about
eight major characters

00:59:17.900 --> 00:59:20.530
and then the minor ones.

00:59:20.530 --> 00:59:25.090
Structurally, how do you
set about tackling something

00:59:25.090 --> 00:59:26.440
with such a big canvas?

00:59:26.440 --> 00:59:29.800
Do you have a big white
board with lots of--

00:59:29.800 --> 00:59:31.630
I use Scrivener.

00:59:31.630 --> 00:59:33.040
What's that?

00:59:33.040 --> 00:59:35.590
Scrivener.

00:59:35.590 --> 00:59:37.480
So I didn't use it
for my first book,

00:59:37.480 --> 00:59:38.867
because it's a
much shorter book.

00:59:38.867 --> 00:59:40.450
So I don't mind
having lots of people.

00:59:40.450 --> 00:59:41.940
I do lots and lots of outlines.

00:59:41.940 --> 00:59:44.644
I'm constantly writing outlines.

00:59:44.644 --> 00:59:46.060
And whenever I
talk to students, I

00:59:46.060 --> 00:59:49.130
recommend that they use
really inexpensive paper

00:59:49.130 --> 00:59:50.620
and to not get attached.

00:59:50.620 --> 00:59:54.850
So do not buy a leather
tooled bound journal

00:59:54.850 --> 00:59:57.790
and think that you have to
write something lapidary in it.

00:59:57.790 --> 00:59:58.870
Do not do that.

00:59:58.870 --> 01:00:01.400
You should have half
used legal pads,

01:00:01.400 --> 01:00:04.690
ideal, that somebody
else is throwing away.

01:00:04.690 --> 01:00:06.850
And you should doodle
and it should be playful.

01:00:06.850 --> 01:00:08.830
But I believe in having
lots of outlines.

01:00:08.830 --> 01:00:10.870
But then the Scrivener
thing was very helpful

01:00:10.870 --> 01:00:12.760
for this book because
of the history.

01:00:12.760 --> 01:00:14.290
So Scrivener is
a tool that a lot

01:00:14.290 --> 01:00:17.950
of academics and journalists
use to write nonfiction work.

01:00:17.950 --> 01:00:19.430
And you could see--

01:00:19.430 --> 01:00:21.370
it's just an
organizing software.

01:00:21.370 --> 01:00:23.500
Very helpful if you
have many chapters.

01:00:23.500 --> 01:00:26.740
And I always have
over 50 chapters.

01:00:26.740 --> 01:00:29.380
But you knew that you would
have over 50 chapters?

01:00:29.380 --> 01:00:31.450
Oh yeah, I could see
it in my head for sure.

01:00:31.450 --> 01:00:33.540
OK.

01:00:33.540 --> 01:00:37.150
And were there minor
characters along the way

01:00:37.150 --> 01:00:39.220
that surprised you?

01:00:39.220 --> 01:00:40.450
Oh yes.

01:00:40.450 --> 01:00:42.040
I love that.

01:00:42.040 --> 01:00:43.800
I mean, I was surprised by--

01:00:43.800 --> 01:00:47.390
But I'm the kind of person who
falls in love with an elevator.

01:00:47.390 --> 01:00:50.140
I'll be in an elevator and I'll
do think, oh my god, you're

01:00:50.140 --> 01:00:51.720
amazing.

01:00:51.720 --> 01:00:54.330
Can I just follow you?

01:00:54.330 --> 01:00:56.080
I'm not going to be a
stalker or anything.

01:00:56.080 --> 01:01:03.160
But I'm just very vulnerable
to people's beauty and charm

01:01:03.160 --> 01:01:07.510
and earnestness.

01:01:07.510 --> 01:01:11.050
I definitely feel so vulnerable
to people's earnestness.

01:01:11.050 --> 01:01:13.791
Sincerity and authenticity.

01:01:13.791 --> 01:01:15.790
And I hate that word,
because it's been co-opted

01:01:15.790 --> 01:01:17.440
by the business people.

01:01:17.440 --> 01:01:23.722
But when someone seems true
to me, there's nothing sexier.

01:01:23.722 --> 01:01:25.930
There's nothing sexier than
someone who is very true.

01:01:25.930 --> 01:01:26.700
And I think, ah.

01:01:26.700 --> 01:01:29.360
It has nothing to do
with their appearances.

01:01:29.360 --> 01:01:31.590
And I want to put
them in a book.

01:01:31.590 --> 01:01:34.340
So have you ever set out
to put minor characters

01:01:34.340 --> 01:01:37.690
in a book in that way and
then had to kill them off?

01:01:37.690 --> 01:01:39.370
Sure.

01:01:39.370 --> 01:01:44.110
But I also find that
if I like something,

01:01:44.110 --> 01:01:49.000
then somebody who likes my
work will like that person.

01:01:49.000 --> 01:01:53.500
So I mean, how do you
feel about your readers?

01:01:53.500 --> 01:01:55.450
The way I look at
my readers is that I

01:01:55.450 --> 01:01:59.510
think I don't know if I'll
have that many readers.

01:01:59.510 --> 01:02:01.030
Now you'll know.

01:02:01.030 --> 01:02:03.850
But whoever my
readers are, I think

01:02:03.850 --> 01:02:06.640
they'll want to be with me.

01:02:06.640 --> 01:02:08.585
In the same way, there
are certain readers

01:02:08.585 --> 01:02:09.460
who don't want to be.

01:02:09.460 --> 01:02:10.840
I want to be with George Eliot.

01:02:10.840 --> 01:02:13.960
Whatever George Eliot writes,
I want to be with her.

01:02:13.960 --> 01:02:15.294
She could write anything.

01:02:15.294 --> 01:02:17.460
In the same way Annie Dillard
could write about sand

01:02:17.460 --> 01:02:18.876
and I'm like, I
want to read that.

01:02:18.876 --> 01:02:20.092
I need to read that.

01:02:20.092 --> 01:02:21.550
Other people may
not feel that way.

01:02:21.550 --> 01:02:24.986
And I think when Claire Messud
comes out with a new book,

01:02:24.986 --> 01:02:25.860
I get really excited.

01:02:25.860 --> 01:02:29.010
I order it in first edition
hardcover, and so should you.

01:02:29.010 --> 01:02:32.490
But there's a kind of you
get excited because you're

01:02:32.490 --> 01:02:34.230
with a person's moral vision.

01:02:34.230 --> 01:02:38.130
And I use that word moral
vision very specifically.

01:02:38.130 --> 01:02:39.180
And I like that.

01:02:39.180 --> 01:02:41.170
It makes me feel comfortable.

01:02:41.170 --> 01:02:44.220
So I think I don't worry too
much about the aesthetics.

01:02:44.220 --> 01:02:45.840
Because if I'm true
to my aesthetic,

01:02:45.840 --> 01:02:46.914
somehow it will cohere.

01:02:50.520 --> 01:02:51.020
Yeah.

01:02:51.020 --> 01:02:54.590
I mean, one of the things that
I sort of come back to often

01:02:54.590 --> 01:02:56.870
as a writer, in
teaching certainly,

01:02:56.870 --> 01:03:01.610
is the degree to which
it's a balance of freedom

01:03:01.610 --> 01:03:02.900
and constraint.

01:03:02.900 --> 01:03:06.560
So there's the outline,
but you will stray from it.

01:03:06.560 --> 01:03:08.917
There's the shape that you
envisage, but you will be--

01:03:08.917 --> 01:03:11.000
there's what you envisage,
but you will inevitably

01:03:11.000 --> 01:03:13.140
be surprised along the way.

01:03:13.140 --> 01:03:16.100
And if you aren't
surprised, why do it?

01:03:16.100 --> 01:03:18.420
Also what do you
think about pleasure?

01:03:18.420 --> 01:03:20.240
I think pleasure
is very important.

01:03:20.240 --> 01:03:21.820
Me too.

01:03:21.820 --> 01:03:23.630
I think that pleasure
is so important.

01:03:23.630 --> 01:03:26.120
Because it's not
like we get paid

01:03:26.120 --> 01:03:28.190
to write these
books in a big way.

01:03:28.190 --> 01:03:30.500
I mean, it would make more
sense if we did other things

01:03:30.500 --> 01:03:31.230
with our lives.

01:03:31.230 --> 01:03:31.730
Always.

01:03:31.730 --> 01:03:32.360
Right?

01:03:32.360 --> 01:03:34.280
So I think that for
me, the pleasure

01:03:34.280 --> 01:03:38.900
has to be in the playfulness of
my vision and in the reworking.

01:03:38.900 --> 01:03:42.170
And if certain characters
show up and they surprise me,

01:03:42.170 --> 01:03:45.500
I think, oh, I get
to play some more.

01:03:45.500 --> 01:03:48.120
And that gives me an
enormous sense of pleasure.

01:03:48.120 --> 01:03:49.910
I think what takes
the pleasure out

01:03:49.910 --> 01:03:54.340
of writing books is
all the other stuff.

01:03:54.340 --> 01:03:55.610
The expectations.

01:03:58.670 --> 01:04:00.350
We had a class
earlier today where

01:04:00.350 --> 01:04:03.290
I met very talented writers,
some of whom are here.

01:04:03.290 --> 01:04:08.400
I always worry that they have
a feeling that they have to--

01:04:08.400 --> 01:04:10.790
they expect things
from this book.

01:04:10.790 --> 01:04:13.250
They expect things from
their publications.

01:04:13.250 --> 01:04:17.440
And I think that's
what causes heartbreak.

01:04:17.440 --> 01:04:23.630
Yeah, I mean, I do think there's
a longer conversation that you

01:04:23.630 --> 01:04:26.090
spoke of it a bit
at lunchtime saying

01:04:26.090 --> 01:04:28.550
you do this because it
matters to you and not

01:04:28.550 --> 01:04:30.050
for any other reason.

01:04:30.050 --> 01:04:33.980
I mean, no rational person
spends 30 years on a book.

01:04:33.980 --> 01:04:35.590
I mean, you can't
be very bright.

01:04:35.590 --> 01:04:38.690
[LAUGHTER]

01:04:38.690 --> 01:04:40.420
I beg to differ.

01:04:40.420 --> 01:04:41.360
You know what I mean.

01:04:41.360 --> 01:04:43.130
You can't be very practical.

01:04:43.130 --> 01:04:44.570
I'm not a practical person.

01:04:44.570 --> 01:04:46.700
It's not a practical decision.

01:04:46.700 --> 01:04:48.350
And there's always
something else

01:04:48.350 --> 01:04:51.020
that the world thinks
you should be doing.

01:04:51.020 --> 01:04:51.832
It's always yeah.

01:04:51.832 --> 01:04:52.790
Like paying your taxes.

01:04:52.790 --> 01:04:55.680
I had to get an
extension this year.

01:04:55.680 --> 01:04:56.810
I can imagine.

01:04:56.810 --> 01:04:58.960
Min has been on
the road nonstop.

01:04:58.960 --> 01:05:01.610
Freaking forever, yeah.

01:05:01.610 --> 01:05:06.530
So just quickly, so the
title, which refers to a game.

01:05:06.530 --> 01:05:11.940
And you've spoken about
the choice of that game.

01:05:11.940 --> 01:05:15.460
I mean, that game has
become central to the novel.

01:05:15.460 --> 01:05:20.740
But it's almost more
metaphorically important too,

01:05:20.740 --> 01:05:21.240
I think.

01:05:21.240 --> 01:05:22.100
Oh, it's really important.

01:05:22.100 --> 01:05:23.840
And I wondered if you wanted
to talk a little about that.

01:05:23.840 --> 01:05:24.410
Sure.

01:05:24.410 --> 01:05:26.576
No, my publisher's always
asking me to talk about it

01:05:26.576 --> 01:05:27.710
and I always forget.

01:05:27.710 --> 01:05:30.335
So I wonder if my
editor called you today.

01:05:30.335 --> 01:05:31.325
No.

01:05:31.325 --> 01:05:32.810
No.

01:05:32.810 --> 01:05:35.760
So pachinko is a $203
billion business,

01:05:35.760 --> 01:05:38.330
which is a cornerstone
of the Japanese economy.

01:05:38.330 --> 01:05:43.710
It is twice the export revenues
of the Japanese auto industry.

01:05:43.710 --> 01:05:44.600
That's enormous.

01:05:44.600 --> 01:05:48.350
So when you think about $203
billion, for the lay person,

01:05:48.350 --> 01:05:50.610
it's really hard to
imagine what that means.

01:05:50.610 --> 01:05:52.526
But if you know that you
have something called

01:05:52.526 --> 01:05:55.160
the Subaru or the
Toyota or the Honda,

01:05:55.160 --> 01:05:58.200
then you realize,
oh, $203 billion.

01:05:58.200 --> 01:05:59.450
And that's a declining number.

01:05:59.450 --> 01:06:00.325
It used to be bigger.

01:06:00.325 --> 01:06:02.730
Every year that
number gets smaller.

01:06:02.730 --> 01:06:04.800
However, it's still
twice export revenues.

01:06:04.800 --> 01:06:07.940
So it isn't like when you and
I think about going to Vegas

01:06:07.940 --> 01:06:09.680
or going to a gambling hall.

01:06:09.680 --> 01:06:13.020
So you'll find a pachinko parlor
in pretty much every street,

01:06:13.020 --> 01:06:16.280
every train station, every bus
station, every shopping center

01:06:16.280 --> 01:06:17.570
you'll see a pachinko parlor.

01:06:17.570 --> 01:06:19.190
Even in the most
rural areas, you'll

01:06:19.190 --> 01:06:21.200
find even bigger
pachinko parlors

01:06:21.200 --> 01:06:23.390
with like 5,000 machines.

01:06:23.390 --> 01:06:26.090
So pachinko is a
vertical pinball game.

01:06:26.090 --> 01:06:27.210
It is not for children.

01:06:27.210 --> 01:06:30.410
It is only for adults,
and it's gambling.

01:06:30.410 --> 01:06:32.120
And you can make money from it.

01:06:32.120 --> 01:06:35.480
This business became really
important after the war,

01:06:35.480 --> 01:06:39.830
and it is dominated by the
Korean Japanese, mostly men.

01:06:39.830 --> 01:06:42.350
And the reason why the
Korean Japanese men

01:06:42.350 --> 01:06:44.420
went into this industry
is because they could not

01:06:44.420 --> 01:06:47.690
find jobs elsewhere.

01:06:47.690 --> 01:06:50.250
And the women usually went
into the yakiniku business,

01:06:50.250 --> 01:06:51.860
which is a Korean BBQ.

01:06:51.860 --> 01:06:53.450
So women went into
food, men went

01:06:53.450 --> 01:06:55.310
into this gambling business.

01:06:55.310 --> 01:06:57.470
Pachinko is played
by the Japanese

01:06:57.470 --> 01:07:02.240
once a week by one out of 11
Japanese play it once a week.

01:07:02.240 --> 01:07:03.200
So it's pretty normal.

01:07:03.200 --> 01:07:05.366
It isn't like when you and
I go to Vegas, let's say,

01:07:05.366 --> 01:07:08.630
once every lifetime and kind
of go, whoo-hoo, we did that.

01:07:08.630 --> 01:07:10.580
It's part of your life.

01:07:10.580 --> 01:07:15.530
And what I should
say here, it's very

01:07:15.530 --> 01:07:19.910
important, is that unlike the
way we think about going to,

01:07:19.910 --> 01:07:21.950
let's say, Atlantic
City or Vegas, we

01:07:21.950 --> 01:07:25.670
don't say that the people
who work there are dirty,

01:07:25.670 --> 01:07:29.210
low class, criminal,
supporters of North Korean

01:07:29.210 --> 01:07:32.690
nuclear armament building.

01:07:32.690 --> 01:07:33.980
We don't say those things.

01:07:33.980 --> 01:07:39.300
We think my cousin John might be
dealing cards in Atlantic City.

01:07:39.300 --> 01:07:41.460
That's just his job.

01:07:41.460 --> 01:07:44.060
Unfortunately, people who
work in the pachinko industry

01:07:44.060 --> 01:07:46.850
are considered low
class, dirty, and all

01:07:46.850 --> 01:07:49.490
the negative stereotypes
of the business

01:07:49.490 --> 01:07:52.320
are imputed to ethnic Koreans.

01:07:52.320 --> 01:07:55.800
So even if you
weren't in pachinko,

01:07:55.800 --> 01:07:58.200
you're considered those things.

01:07:58.200 --> 01:08:00.870
I have not yet met a
single Korean person

01:08:00.870 --> 01:08:03.780
from Japan who doesn't have
somebody in his or her family

01:08:03.780 --> 01:08:06.270
that has some
connection to pachinko.

01:08:06.270 --> 01:08:09.540
There's an uncle,
a cousin, somebody.

01:08:09.540 --> 01:08:13.200
I wanted to argue, because
pachinko, like gambling,

01:08:13.200 --> 01:08:14.940
is a rigged business.

01:08:14.940 --> 01:08:18.000
There's no way that
you'll win every time.

01:08:18.000 --> 01:08:21.149
The odds will always
favor the house.

01:08:21.149 --> 01:08:23.740
And yet you play.

01:08:23.740 --> 01:08:27.300
And I wanted to argue that
life is like pachinko.

01:08:27.300 --> 01:08:29.069
That it's rigged,
but we still play.

01:08:31.840 --> 01:08:33.960
Well, what's the alternative?

01:08:33.960 --> 01:08:35.500
Thank you.

01:08:35.500 --> 01:08:37.500
[LAUGHTER]

01:08:37.500 --> 01:08:40.580
I mean, I feel with the pachinko
parlor, you could just go home.

01:08:40.580 --> 01:08:41.700
Right, yeah.

01:08:41.700 --> 01:08:44.220
But in life, not
so many choices.

01:08:44.220 --> 01:08:45.529
No, there aren't.

01:08:45.529 --> 01:08:49.934
And I guess it really
depends on how you play.

01:08:49.934 --> 01:08:51.819
I mean, one last
question and then--

01:08:51.819 --> 01:08:52.319
Sure.

01:08:52.319 --> 01:08:55.680
I mean, it's interesting
because there's so

01:08:55.680 --> 01:08:58.200
much in this book that is dark.

01:08:58.200 --> 01:09:00.870
And yet the book is not
a dark book to read.

01:09:00.870 --> 01:09:05.100
It's actually exhilarating
and vital and full

01:09:05.100 --> 01:09:06.319
of all sorts of--

01:09:06.319 --> 01:09:08.649
I mean, it's just constantly.

01:09:08.649 --> 01:09:10.050
And sometimes very funny too.

01:09:13.733 --> 01:09:15.149
Do you think that's
something that

01:09:15.149 --> 01:09:20.430
just arises from your worldview,
your vision as a writer?

01:09:20.430 --> 01:09:21.990
Was that conscious
or deliberate?

01:09:21.990 --> 01:09:25.859
Did you think, oh, I must
leaven this dark stretch.

01:09:25.859 --> 01:09:29.850
I must put something
happy after something sad?

01:09:29.850 --> 01:09:33.300
Oh, this is really important.

01:09:33.300 --> 01:09:37.170
I found my conversation
with the Korean Japanese

01:09:37.170 --> 01:09:42.300
to be so moving, to be so
delightful, so humorous

01:09:42.300 --> 01:09:45.420
that everything that I had
in my first book I realized

01:09:45.420 --> 01:09:49.859
was trash because it was
so dark and so depressing

01:09:49.859 --> 01:09:51.510
and so self righteous.

01:09:51.510 --> 01:09:54.149
So Motherland, this book
that I had written before,

01:09:54.149 --> 01:09:57.000
which was factually
incredibly accurate,

01:09:57.000 --> 01:10:01.320
was a very indignant
book, and it was dull.

01:10:01.320 --> 01:10:03.120
Oh my god, it was so dull.

01:10:03.120 --> 01:10:05.040
And I didn't send it
out because I knew

01:10:05.040 --> 01:10:07.410
that it wouldn't have a chance.

01:10:07.410 --> 01:10:09.330
And then when I
was writing this,

01:10:09.330 --> 01:10:10.720
I kept hearing the voices.

01:10:10.720 --> 01:10:13.650
So when I read, I try
to sound like the way

01:10:13.650 --> 01:10:15.571
I heard my interviewees speak.

01:10:15.571 --> 01:10:17.070
And that's the
reason why interviews

01:10:17.070 --> 01:10:19.560
are so important to me,
because I could hear them,

01:10:19.560 --> 01:10:22.410
and then I try to
understand their melody

01:10:22.410 --> 01:10:24.940
as well as the rhythm
of their speech.

01:10:24.940 --> 01:10:26.574
Because everybody
is so different.

01:10:26.574 --> 01:10:27.990
But the Korean
Japanese, depending

01:10:27.990 --> 01:10:30.360
upon which region
that you grew up

01:10:30.360 --> 01:10:33.480
in or which
political affiliation

01:10:33.480 --> 01:10:35.700
you had, actually
talked differently

01:10:35.700 --> 01:10:37.560
in terms of their meter.

01:10:37.560 --> 01:10:40.170
So I tried really
hard to get that.

01:10:40.170 --> 01:10:41.390
That's wonderful.

01:10:41.390 --> 01:10:44.370
I have a friend who's
a playwright who

01:10:44.370 --> 01:10:46.800
speaks about how when
he's writing a part,

01:10:46.800 --> 01:10:48.240
it's always for him embodied.

01:10:48.240 --> 01:10:50.130
And he's picturing
is it somebody

01:10:50.130 --> 01:10:53.110
who's big and barrel chested
who speaks from the chest

01:10:53.110 --> 01:10:57.060
or is it anybody who
speaks from the front?

01:10:57.060 --> 01:11:00.450
We're animals and we
live in our bodies.

01:11:00.450 --> 01:11:01.680
I like that.

01:11:01.680 --> 01:11:05.880
Until you have that embodied
sense of your characters, which

01:11:05.880 --> 01:11:09.060
that's what you're saying in a
way about hearing their voices.

01:11:09.060 --> 01:11:10.220
I like that so much.

01:11:10.220 --> 01:11:12.960
When I was a kid, I didn't
talk until I was almost

01:11:12.960 --> 01:11:15.420
at the end of middle school.

01:11:15.420 --> 01:11:17.970
And I took all these
speech classes.

01:11:17.970 --> 01:11:22.560
And I think during that
time when I wasn't talking,

01:11:22.560 --> 01:11:25.260
I was really paying
attention to how people talk,

01:11:25.260 --> 01:11:28.764
because I wanted to
learn how to talk.

01:11:28.764 --> 01:11:29.930
I know it sounds really odd.

01:11:29.930 --> 01:11:31.300
I don't even know what I had.

01:11:31.300 --> 01:11:33.090
But my sisters were fine.

01:11:33.090 --> 01:11:34.840
So it wasn't that I
couldn't speak English

01:11:34.840 --> 01:11:36.715
or I couldn't speak
Korean or couldn't speak.

01:11:36.715 --> 01:11:38.440
It was like I just
couldn't figure out

01:11:38.440 --> 01:11:40.540
how to have a conversation
with another person.

01:11:40.540 --> 01:11:42.460
I didn't know how to
break in a conversation.

01:11:42.460 --> 01:11:44.050
I didn't know how to listen.

01:11:44.050 --> 01:11:48.440
And also middle school
girls were just so puzzling.

01:11:48.440 --> 01:11:51.670
I think everybody
feels that way.

01:11:51.670 --> 01:11:58.810
So in that context, I think I
have become a very good mimic.

01:11:58.810 --> 01:12:00.970
Because I have been
really paying attention

01:12:00.970 --> 01:12:04.270
to how people talk and I
want to understand, oh,

01:12:04.270 --> 01:12:06.820
is that what a ruling
class person does?

01:12:06.820 --> 01:12:09.100
Is that what a working
class person does

01:12:09.100 --> 01:12:12.550
from Queens versus a ruling
class person who grew up in,

01:12:12.550 --> 01:12:13.780
let's say, Connecticut?

01:12:13.780 --> 01:12:16.650
Everybody has a
different kind of stance.

01:12:16.650 --> 01:12:20.320
So I've been watching
people's body language.

01:12:20.320 --> 01:12:21.580
I study body language a lot.

01:12:21.580 --> 01:12:22.870
I mean, you do too right?

01:12:22.870 --> 01:12:24.370
You can't not.

01:12:24.370 --> 01:12:25.540
And I like it.

01:12:25.540 --> 01:12:27.670
Again, it gives me pleasure.

01:12:27.670 --> 01:12:29.200
It makes me feel safe.

01:12:29.200 --> 01:12:32.452
I think that safety is very
important for foreigners.

01:12:32.452 --> 01:12:33.910
I definitely feel
like a foreigner,

01:12:33.910 --> 01:12:35.960
even though that makes no sense.

01:12:35.960 --> 01:12:39.130
And part of that alienation
from other people,

01:12:39.130 --> 01:12:43.780
I think I manage it
through study of behavior.

01:12:43.780 --> 01:12:45.280
And that makes a
lot of sense to me.

01:12:45.280 --> 01:12:48.610
And I oddly feel
like a foreigner too.

01:12:48.610 --> 01:12:50.480
But you lived in
other countries.

01:12:50.480 --> 01:12:50.980
Yeah.

01:12:50.980 --> 01:12:55.270
And I had a friend who once
said to me, oh, in America,

01:12:55.270 --> 01:12:57.070
there's no social class.

01:12:57.070 --> 01:12:57.970
And I said, what?

01:12:57.970 --> 01:12:58.820
Rubbish.

01:12:58.820 --> 01:13:00.020
[LAUGHS]

01:13:00.020 --> 01:13:02.190
Have you not been
paying attention?

01:13:02.190 --> 01:13:05.440
But anyway, but I think
part of it is not reading,

01:13:05.440 --> 01:13:07.690
actually, as you say, the
way people move in the world

01:13:07.690 --> 01:13:11.637
and how differently
people move in the world.

01:13:11.637 --> 01:13:12.970
There are many people, I'm sure.

01:13:12.970 --> 01:13:14.720
Yes, I know some people
may need to leave.

01:13:14.720 --> 01:13:16.570
If you do, that's fine.

01:13:16.570 --> 01:13:19.150
I will miss you.

01:13:19.150 --> 01:13:22.690
But now is the time
for you guys to ask

01:13:22.690 --> 01:13:25.070
what questions you may have.

01:13:25.070 --> 01:13:26.110
We don't have a mic?

01:13:26.110 --> 01:13:27.360
We do have a mic happening.

01:13:27.360 --> 01:13:31.030
Sir, a mic is on its way.

01:13:31.030 --> 01:13:31.900
Yes sir.

01:13:31.900 --> 01:13:34.282
Hang on one second.

01:13:34.282 --> 01:13:38.700
In terms of language and
rhythm and that sort of thing,

01:13:38.700 --> 01:13:44.010
when you were there speaking
with the Japanese Koreans,

01:13:44.010 --> 01:13:46.750
some of them may not have
spoken Korean if they were there

01:13:46.750 --> 01:13:49.130
for generations.

01:13:49.130 --> 01:13:51.970
Did you learn Japanese
before you went there?

01:13:51.970 --> 01:13:53.882
What did you conduct
your interviews in?

01:13:53.882 --> 01:13:55.090
That's an excellent question.

01:13:55.090 --> 01:13:56.090
Your name is?

01:13:56.090 --> 01:13:56.590
Phil.

01:13:56.590 --> 01:13:59.260
So Phil's question is, how
did I conduct my interviews?

01:13:59.260 --> 01:14:01.450
And so depending upon
who my subject was,

01:14:01.450 --> 01:14:03.280
I would have to
hire interviewers.

01:14:03.280 --> 01:14:06.100
I do have some working
knowledge of Korean

01:14:06.100 --> 01:14:09.430
and some tiny working
knowledge of Japanese.

01:14:09.430 --> 01:14:11.680
But it's not enough
in any way to conduct

01:14:11.680 --> 01:14:13.240
a thoughtful interview.

01:14:13.240 --> 01:14:16.810
I conducted a lot of interviews
with translators as well as

01:14:16.810 --> 01:14:19.810
in English, depending
upon who I could talk to.

01:14:19.810 --> 01:14:21.820
But the way I
conduct interviews.

01:14:21.820 --> 01:14:25.400
For example, Phil,
may I ask what you do?

01:14:25.400 --> 01:14:25.900
Great.

01:14:25.900 --> 01:14:26.733
You're a headhunter.

01:14:26.733 --> 01:14:27.310
Perfect.

01:14:27.310 --> 01:14:30.100
So you actually interview
all the time, right?

01:14:30.100 --> 01:14:30.880
In English.

01:14:30.880 --> 01:14:34.567
So if I had to have a
headhunter in my book,

01:14:34.567 --> 01:14:36.900
and for those of you who don't
know what headhunting is,

01:14:36.900 --> 01:14:39.550
it's people who help
other people find jobs.

01:14:39.550 --> 01:14:42.080
That's probably the
safest way to look at it.

01:14:42.080 --> 01:14:44.980
So they're actually assessing
personalities constantly.

01:14:44.980 --> 01:14:48.040
So if I had to have a
headhunter in my book,

01:14:48.040 --> 01:14:51.560
I would probably interview
maybe six or seven.

01:14:51.560 --> 01:14:53.477
So let's say I have Phil.

01:14:53.477 --> 01:14:54.310
I would talk to you.

01:14:54.310 --> 01:14:55.240
We would have lunch.

01:14:55.240 --> 01:14:57.460
And then for about
three hours or so,

01:14:57.460 --> 01:14:59.260
I would ask you a
lot of questions.

01:14:59.260 --> 01:15:04.600
I would probably use about
2% of what we talk about.

01:15:04.600 --> 01:15:08.050
So very often it isn't
just what you say,

01:15:08.050 --> 01:15:12.210
because most of what
people say isn't true.

01:15:12.210 --> 01:15:13.680
Right?

01:15:13.680 --> 01:15:16.360
I mean, unfortunately.

01:15:16.360 --> 01:15:19.330
Whether it's out of
politeness or whether it's

01:15:19.330 --> 01:15:22.391
because of ignorance or
whether it's because of--

01:15:22.391 --> 01:15:23.890
I don't think it's
always malicious.

01:15:23.890 --> 01:15:25.780
I don't think it's
always malicious.

01:15:25.780 --> 01:15:28.600
I think people don't
say what they really

01:15:28.600 --> 01:15:32.620
feel because we have
certain laws in society that

01:15:32.620 --> 01:15:34.810
says we can't say those things.

01:15:34.810 --> 01:15:37.240
Which is kind of in some ways
unfortunate but in some ways

01:15:37.240 --> 01:15:38.781
very fortunate,
because I don't think

01:15:38.781 --> 01:15:41.170
I really want to know everything
that you think about me.

01:15:41.170 --> 01:15:43.720
It may not be good.

01:15:43.720 --> 01:15:46.810
So I really need to
spend time with a person.

01:15:46.810 --> 01:15:48.400
So part of my
interview isn't what's

01:15:48.400 --> 01:15:50.320
actually what I write down.

01:15:50.320 --> 01:15:55.060
And also I never record
anything on a tape recorder.

01:15:55.060 --> 01:15:57.850
Because it makes
a person freeze.

01:15:57.850 --> 01:16:01.960
So I use, again, a
half used legal pad.

01:16:01.960 --> 01:16:04.090
I scrawl a couple
of things down.

01:16:04.090 --> 01:16:07.870
But mostly I'm looking at, oh,
does he nod when I say this?

01:16:07.870 --> 01:16:09.640
Or does he touch his hair?

01:16:09.640 --> 01:16:11.500
Or why does he fiddle
with his glasses

01:16:11.500 --> 01:16:13.000
when I asked a
troubling question?

01:16:13.000 --> 01:16:14.920
I'm looking for your tells.

01:16:14.920 --> 01:16:16.090
That's kind of what I do.

01:16:16.090 --> 01:16:18.810
Because a tell of a headhunter
may be different than a

01:16:18.810 --> 01:16:22.370
tell of a person who's
looking for a job.

01:16:22.370 --> 01:16:25.720
So I'm really studying that.

01:16:25.720 --> 01:16:27.840
And then I might spend
time at your office

01:16:27.840 --> 01:16:30.460
to see what do other
headhunters think about Phil.

01:16:30.460 --> 01:16:32.860
Why is he considered
a leader in his job?

01:16:32.860 --> 01:16:34.530
Does that make sense?

01:16:34.530 --> 01:16:39.220
And then doing that 360
takes a lot of time.

01:16:39.220 --> 01:16:40.960
But it does give me
a lot of confidence

01:16:40.960 --> 01:16:45.160
though when I write about
that subject, which is nice,

01:16:45.160 --> 01:16:49.870
because I'm not a very confident
person about different kinds

01:16:49.870 --> 01:16:52.142
of work.

01:16:52.142 --> 01:16:53.040
Interesting.

01:16:53.040 --> 01:16:55.840
I remember having a conversation
with Jennifer Egan where

01:16:55.840 --> 01:16:59.390
she talked about the
insanely labor intensive way

01:16:59.390 --> 01:17:01.540
that she has of working.

01:17:01.540 --> 01:17:02.280
And it's true.

01:17:02.280 --> 01:17:05.870
Similarly, when you're
saying you might interview

01:17:05.870 --> 01:17:07.010
six or seven, did you say?

01:17:07.010 --> 01:17:07.790
Yeah, absolutely.

01:17:07.790 --> 01:17:08.290
Right.

01:17:08.290 --> 01:17:10.970
That's three hours apiece.

01:17:10.970 --> 01:17:14.030
That's a lot of time.

01:17:14.030 --> 01:17:14.945
It's a lot.

01:17:14.945 --> 01:17:16.881
It's a good way to
avoid writing too.

01:17:16.881 --> 01:17:17.380
Yeah, I bet.

01:17:20.420 --> 01:17:22.510
Yes ma'am, in the back.

01:17:22.510 --> 01:17:23.010
Yes.

01:17:27.720 --> 01:17:28.220
Hi.

01:17:28.220 --> 01:17:30.180
Thank you for coming
and being with us.

01:17:30.180 --> 01:17:32.900
My name's Anna, and I'm
a graduate student here.

01:17:32.900 --> 01:17:35.960
And I have a follow up
question to his question

01:17:35.960 --> 01:17:39.140
and then I had one
other short question.

01:17:39.140 --> 01:17:41.360
Thinking about the translation
for your interviews,

01:17:41.360 --> 01:17:43.580
I'm wondering about
the translation

01:17:43.580 --> 01:17:46.700
of the book and kind of
what the plans are for that.

01:17:46.700 --> 01:17:51.140
Or for some of your interviewees
or Japanese Koreans,

01:17:51.140 --> 01:17:56.600
Japanese, what has the reception
been to your book there?

01:17:56.600 --> 01:17:57.740
That's my first question.

01:17:57.740 --> 01:18:00.500
And my second question
was just knowing

01:18:00.500 --> 01:18:03.042
that this story is based
on a series of interviews

01:18:03.042 --> 01:18:04.500
and a lot of research
that you did,

01:18:04.500 --> 01:18:06.208
I wondered if you
could talk a little bit

01:18:06.208 --> 01:18:09.350
about the relationship
between Sunja and her mother

01:18:09.350 --> 01:18:12.260
and where that story came from.

01:18:12.260 --> 01:18:13.680
So Anna's question.

01:18:13.680 --> 01:18:17.960
The first one is that
it's sold 24 countries.

01:18:17.960 --> 01:18:21.050
And last month it sold to Japan.

01:18:21.050 --> 01:18:22.610
So that was really
exciting for me,

01:18:22.610 --> 01:18:25.160
because I had kind of given up.

01:18:25.160 --> 01:18:27.560
And it's being published
by Bungeishunju, which is

01:18:27.560 --> 01:18:29.630
a very prestigious publisher.

01:18:29.630 --> 01:18:32.600
But they really came in
after every single person

01:18:32.600 --> 01:18:34.760
said it's OK.

01:18:34.760 --> 01:18:37.400
So that's really surprising,
because the greatest audience,

01:18:37.400 --> 01:18:39.140
I think, would be in Japan.

01:18:39.140 --> 01:18:43.160
I never thought you guys
would read this book.

01:18:43.160 --> 01:18:44.960
It just wasn't part
of my consciousness.

01:18:44.960 --> 01:18:48.790
I figured I'll finish it
and if nobody buys it,

01:18:48.790 --> 01:18:51.110
then I thought I
would approach maybe

01:18:51.110 --> 01:18:54.560
a third tier academic press
and publish it for free.

01:18:54.560 --> 01:18:57.920
Because I knew that there was a
need for the book because it's

01:18:57.920 --> 01:19:01.160
the first book about the Korean
Japanese written in English

01:19:01.160 --> 01:19:01.940
as a novel.

01:19:01.940 --> 01:19:04.070
So I figured
somebody may want it.

01:19:04.070 --> 01:19:06.230
Some grad student,
some poor grad student

01:19:06.230 --> 01:19:07.822
may read this thing.

01:19:07.822 --> 01:19:09.530
And I thought that
would be the end of it

01:19:09.530 --> 01:19:10.904
and I could move
on with my life.

01:19:10.904 --> 01:19:15.170
And I really did think
about selling real estate.

01:19:15.170 --> 01:19:16.250
I did.

01:19:16.250 --> 01:19:16.940
I did.

01:19:16.940 --> 01:19:18.330
I think I'd be good.

01:19:18.330 --> 01:19:19.250
[LAUGHTER]

01:19:19.250 --> 01:19:21.410
It's always open to you.

01:19:21.410 --> 01:19:25.070
Wouldn't you buy
a house from me?

01:19:25.070 --> 01:19:27.914
And not that it's
an easy job, but I

01:19:27.914 --> 01:19:30.080
had interviewed enough real
estate brokers thinking,

01:19:30.080 --> 01:19:31.560
I think I can make that work.

01:19:31.560 --> 01:19:35.480
So anyhow, so that's
my first question.

01:19:35.480 --> 01:19:39.140
I think I covered it about
all these different countries.

01:19:39.140 --> 01:19:42.290
And in terms of its reception,
it has been received very well.

01:19:42.290 --> 01:19:46.310
I have been fortunate enough to
be on tour for a year and eight

01:19:46.310 --> 01:19:48.200
months around the world.

01:19:48.200 --> 01:19:50.780
So I have met a lot of
Korean Japanese people.

01:19:50.780 --> 01:19:55.340
I have been incredibly so
fortunate to meet them.

01:19:55.340 --> 01:19:57.080
And it's terrifying for me.

01:19:57.080 --> 01:20:00.590
It's terrifying because they
usually come with the book

01:20:00.590 --> 01:20:07.160
and they'll hold it and they'll
say, I heard about this book.

01:20:07.160 --> 01:20:09.440
And I heard that you
are Korean American

01:20:09.440 --> 01:20:13.360
and you are not Korean Japanese.

01:20:13.360 --> 01:20:17.690
That's when your stomach lurches
and you just want to die.

01:20:17.690 --> 01:20:19.760
And I just stand there
waiting for that decision.

01:20:19.760 --> 01:20:23.620
And I have yet to have
a negative review.

01:20:23.620 --> 01:20:27.250
Every single one has been
so overwhelmingly emotional

01:20:27.250 --> 01:20:28.660
and positive.

01:20:28.660 --> 01:20:32.360
And they have said that it has
reflected their family stories.

01:20:32.360 --> 01:20:35.380
So they cry, I cry, we all cry.

01:20:35.380 --> 01:20:36.710
It's very emotional.

01:20:36.710 --> 01:20:37.870
There's a lot of hugging.

01:20:37.870 --> 01:20:41.230
And it's very gratifying
because, again, I

01:20:41.230 --> 01:20:43.741
didn't think that
anybody would read it.

01:20:43.741 --> 01:20:44.990
So that's question number one.

01:20:44.990 --> 01:20:46.990
And the second question was?

01:20:46.990 --> 01:20:48.430
About Sunja and her mother.

01:20:48.430 --> 01:20:52.480
Oh yes, this is troubling.

01:20:52.480 --> 01:20:57.340
The way Korean women, especially
the women that I interviewed,

01:20:57.340 --> 01:21:02.740
have been told by their culture
to think about their roles

01:21:02.740 --> 01:21:04.840
is one primarily
where the virtue

01:21:04.840 --> 01:21:08.200
arises from being sacrificial.

01:21:08.200 --> 01:21:10.150
So this is a very serious thing.

01:21:10.150 --> 01:21:13.150
So if you look at all
the folktales of Korea,

01:21:13.150 --> 01:21:14.950
the girls who are
virtuous are the ones

01:21:14.950 --> 01:21:19.210
who will sacrifice their
lives, their bodies, and all

01:21:19.210 --> 01:21:23.770
their time for the
benefit of their families.

01:21:23.770 --> 01:21:26.380
And so one of the things
that I did hear repeatedly

01:21:26.380 --> 01:21:28.930
in all my interviews is that
a woman's lot is to suffer,

01:21:28.930 --> 01:21:30.910
which becomes sort of
a refrain in this book.

01:21:30.910 --> 01:21:34.420
And it came out of the mouths
of my interview subjects.

01:21:34.420 --> 01:21:37.220
And in it one of the
things that I did realize

01:21:37.220 --> 01:21:39.520
is that between
generations, there's

01:21:39.520 --> 01:21:41.740
a lot of resentment
with this idea.

01:21:41.740 --> 01:21:44.530
Of course, I'm going
to be 50 this year.

01:21:44.530 --> 01:21:46.710
I don't want to
suffer all the time.

01:21:46.710 --> 01:21:49.210
And I can't imagine
a young woman

01:21:49.210 --> 01:21:52.180
who goes to Harvard would say,
I want to suffer all the time

01:21:52.180 --> 01:21:54.730
and that she should
always expect it.

01:21:54.730 --> 01:21:58.930
However, I did
think in some ways

01:21:58.930 --> 01:22:03.040
America has a romance with
not wanting to suffer,

01:22:03.040 --> 01:22:05.260
and it causes
Americans to suffer

01:22:05.260 --> 01:22:09.750
a lot in this quest for
happiness and this quest

01:22:09.750 --> 01:22:11.660
to feel good all the time.

01:22:11.660 --> 01:22:14.460
And the quest to not have
suffering, to eliminate it,

01:22:14.460 --> 01:22:16.200
to pretend that it
doesn't exist also

01:22:16.200 --> 01:22:18.930
causes people an
enormous amount of shame

01:22:18.930 --> 01:22:20.800
when they are suffering.

01:22:20.800 --> 01:22:26.000
So I found that wisdom from
these usually poor women

01:22:26.000 --> 01:22:27.480
to be fascinating.

01:22:27.480 --> 01:22:29.280
And of course, the
more I researched,

01:22:29.280 --> 01:22:32.840
all around the world,
they expect suffering.

01:22:32.840 --> 01:22:34.196
History is long.

01:22:34.196 --> 01:22:35.320
There's a lot of suffering.

01:22:35.320 --> 01:22:36.990
And I think that was
very helpful to me.

01:22:36.990 --> 01:22:39.660
But to talk about that
relationship between Sunja

01:22:39.660 --> 01:22:43.170
and Yangjin, I think Yangjin
felt really furious because all

01:22:43.170 --> 01:22:45.690
her life she did sacrifice.

01:22:45.690 --> 01:22:47.940
And then she
realized, what was it

01:22:47.940 --> 01:22:52.230
all for if I can't
have my daughter?

01:22:52.230 --> 01:22:54.576
So there is an
eruption that occurs

01:22:54.576 --> 01:22:56.325
at some point in the
book because of that.

01:22:58.919 --> 01:23:00.210
There's a young man over there.

01:23:08.160 --> 01:23:08.880
Thank you.

01:23:08.880 --> 01:23:10.380
My name is Zia.

01:23:10.380 --> 01:23:13.480
My question is much, much less
interesting than the preceding

01:23:13.480 --> 01:23:13.980
one.

01:23:16.870 --> 01:23:20.220
What kind of attributes
does the reader

01:23:20.220 --> 01:23:23.700
have, the reader in your mind,
if you have a reader in mind?

01:23:26.410 --> 01:23:29.580
What do you expect of
them when you're writing?

01:23:32.800 --> 01:23:37.530
I have a very specific
reader in mind when I draft.

01:23:37.530 --> 01:23:39.730
I think of my sister.

01:23:39.730 --> 01:23:42.360
My younger sister
thinks I'm wonderful.

01:23:42.360 --> 01:23:43.800
[LAUGHTER]

01:23:43.800 --> 01:23:45.910
That's a nice reader to have.

01:23:45.910 --> 01:23:48.360
She thinks that everything
that I say is interesting.

01:23:48.360 --> 01:23:51.300
She thinks I'm a brave person.

01:23:51.300 --> 01:23:53.779
And I'm a very fearful person.

01:23:53.779 --> 01:23:56.070
So I just think it's amazing
that my younger sister can

01:23:56.070 --> 01:23:58.440
actually see this about me.

01:23:58.440 --> 01:24:02.250
So whenever I write, I think,
oh, I think Sang will like it,

01:24:02.250 --> 01:24:05.400
because she likes
everything that I do.

01:24:05.400 --> 01:24:07.590
It's very helpful for drafting.

01:24:07.590 --> 01:24:12.210
When I edit, I come back
and I'm quite serious.

01:24:12.210 --> 01:24:16.440
I become my little legal person
and I can do all my editing.

01:24:16.440 --> 01:24:19.300
But when I draft, when I
actually let the stuff happen,

01:24:19.300 --> 01:24:20.760
I think of my sister.

01:24:20.760 --> 01:24:24.180
That said, when I think about
publication, the final thing,

01:24:24.180 --> 01:24:27.570
when I think about
Zia or Anna or Phil,

01:24:27.570 --> 01:24:29.910
when I think about
you guys, I think

01:24:29.910 --> 01:24:33.510
I owe you something
that's worth your time.

01:24:33.510 --> 01:24:35.460
That's very important.

01:24:35.460 --> 01:24:39.930
Because to ask you to pay
$27, it is a lot of money.

01:24:39.930 --> 01:24:41.730
And from my working
class background,

01:24:41.730 --> 01:24:43.417
I didn't grow up with
a family of books.

01:24:43.417 --> 01:24:44.250
We didn't own books.

01:24:44.250 --> 01:24:45.510
We had to borrow them.

01:24:45.510 --> 01:24:48.640
So the idea that you
pay $27 is a big deal.

01:24:48.640 --> 01:24:51.990
However, I know that
for entertainment, we

01:24:51.990 --> 01:24:53.610
spend a lot of money.

01:24:53.610 --> 01:24:56.230
So $27 may not be
a lot of money.

01:24:56.230 --> 01:24:58.800
However, the thing that's
really valuable to me

01:24:58.800 --> 01:25:03.630
is that if you are willing to
spend 14 to 16 hours with me,

01:25:03.630 --> 01:25:10.560
I think it should be edifying,
and it must give you pleasure.

01:25:10.560 --> 01:25:12.030
If it does not
give you pleasure,

01:25:12.030 --> 01:25:13.950
then I think I have failed.

01:25:13.950 --> 01:25:15.630
So I think that
when I give myself

01:25:15.630 --> 01:25:19.020
pleasure in creating
this work, I also

01:25:19.020 --> 01:25:23.490
have to have aesthetic standards
in which I know what will work.

01:25:23.490 --> 01:25:26.250
I mean, I've studied Aristotle.

01:25:26.250 --> 01:25:28.890
I know that sounded
so pretentious.

01:25:28.890 --> 01:25:29.600
Forgive me.

01:25:29.600 --> 01:25:31.850
Always saying to the students,
start with the poetics.

01:25:31.850 --> 01:25:32.540
Start with the poetics.

01:25:32.540 --> 01:25:33.790
Right, start with the poetics.

01:25:33.790 --> 01:25:36.570
But if you have this idea
of recognition, reversal,

01:25:36.570 --> 01:25:38.280
and catharsis, you
know that there

01:25:38.280 --> 01:25:41.329
is a rule that can make
the reader feel seen

01:25:41.329 --> 01:25:42.870
or the viewer feel
seen, because he's

01:25:42.870 --> 01:25:44.890
writing about plays, obviously.

01:25:44.890 --> 01:25:47.820
So I think that the
bond that you and I have

01:25:47.820 --> 01:25:51.360
for the 14, 16 hours
is a really sacred one

01:25:51.360 --> 01:25:53.070
in which you trust me.

01:25:53.070 --> 01:25:56.980
So if you trust me, I
have to deliver something.

01:25:56.980 --> 01:25:59.320
And I think that bond
is really important.

01:25:59.320 --> 01:26:01.830
And I've been very
fortunate in my travels

01:26:01.830 --> 01:26:05.340
to meet a lot of readers who
feel very burned by the fact

01:26:05.340 --> 01:26:08.880
that writers are showing
off, but they're not

01:26:08.880 --> 01:26:12.090
thinking about their
edification plus pleasure.

01:26:12.090 --> 01:26:13.886
I'm not just
interested in pleasure.

01:26:13.886 --> 01:26:15.510
I'm not just interested
in edification.

01:26:15.510 --> 01:26:16.860
But it has to be both.

01:26:16.860 --> 01:26:19.020
Those are the books
that I like to read.

01:26:19.020 --> 01:26:22.740
They must have the insight
that was very hard earned

01:26:22.740 --> 01:26:24.120
by the author.

01:26:24.120 --> 01:26:25.530
And I think that's
the reason why

01:26:25.530 --> 01:26:28.560
I'm willing to pound
the pavement for it.

01:26:28.560 --> 01:26:31.830
Because if I don't
necessarily earn it myself,

01:26:31.830 --> 01:26:34.740
I have to get it from other
people who are wiser than me.

01:26:34.740 --> 01:26:38.490
So that's my long answer to
your reader question, which

01:26:38.490 --> 01:26:40.290
was not a bad questions, Zia.

01:26:43.181 --> 01:26:43.680
Yes.

01:26:46.610 --> 01:26:47.110
Hi.

01:26:52.160 --> 01:26:53.851
You were in class
today, weren't you?

01:26:53.851 --> 01:26:54.350
I was.

01:26:54.350 --> 01:26:55.580
I was at the lunch.

01:26:55.580 --> 01:26:57.530
Yes, but you didn't talk.

01:26:57.530 --> 01:26:59.900
No, but I cried in front of you.

01:26:59.900 --> 01:27:01.010
I guess that's something.

01:27:01.010 --> 01:27:02.720
Well, I cry too.

01:27:02.720 --> 01:27:05.670
It means that we have
our feelings left.

01:27:05.670 --> 01:27:06.690
I'm Emily.

01:27:06.690 --> 01:27:07.900
I'm an undergrad.

01:27:07.900 --> 01:27:11.720
In a workshop right now we're
talking a lot about revision

01:27:11.720 --> 01:27:13.610
and going through
different ways to revise.

01:27:13.610 --> 01:27:15.440
And it sounds like the
process of drafting

01:27:15.440 --> 01:27:19.430
for you is extremely pleasurable
and you said you don't really

01:27:19.430 --> 01:27:20.270
get writer's block.

01:27:20.270 --> 01:27:21.728
And so I was
wondering in revision,

01:27:21.728 --> 01:27:23.330
how do you get to
the point where

01:27:23.330 --> 01:27:29.330
you can see the story anew,
where you can step out of it

01:27:29.330 --> 01:27:31.700
and figure out what needs
to be changed around,

01:27:31.700 --> 01:27:35.530
figure out what the next
version of the story is?

01:27:35.530 --> 01:27:37.960
Especially with such
long manuscripts.

01:27:37.960 --> 01:27:39.550
Well, it's kind of
what we discussed

01:27:39.550 --> 01:27:40.530
in class a little bit.

01:27:40.530 --> 01:27:42.530
And for those of you who
weren't in class today,

01:27:42.530 --> 01:27:45.740
I do this thing called
finding your theme.

01:27:45.740 --> 01:27:49.240
So I make the students tell
me what they're working on,

01:27:49.240 --> 01:27:52.690
and then I ask them to do a
very emotional essay in about

01:27:52.690 --> 01:27:55.120
10 minutes in which
I'm trying to make sure

01:27:55.120 --> 01:27:57.400
that you bypass your censors.

01:27:57.400 --> 01:28:00.370
Because the censors, that's
what ruins all of us.

01:28:00.370 --> 01:28:02.620
And that's the reason why I
think of my lovely sister,

01:28:02.620 --> 01:28:06.070
because I think she
thinks I'm wonderful.

01:28:06.070 --> 01:28:09.340
And so I don't have to think
about a forbidding voice.

01:28:09.340 --> 01:28:12.040
I don't have a forbidding
voice when I draft.

01:28:12.040 --> 01:28:13.570
And then there's
always a disconnect

01:28:13.570 --> 01:28:15.390
between usually the
project that the person

01:28:15.390 --> 01:28:17.916
is working on versus what
they really care about.

01:28:17.916 --> 01:28:19.540
But once you find
out what the theme is

01:28:19.540 --> 01:28:23.650
and the question that you
want to ask from that theme,

01:28:23.650 --> 01:28:26.770
you will have the courage
to work on that revision,

01:28:26.770 --> 01:28:29.560
and you'll be able to shape it
exactly the way you want to.

01:28:29.560 --> 01:28:30.676
I really believe that.

01:28:30.676 --> 01:28:32.050
And I think very
often people get

01:28:32.050 --> 01:28:35.950
lost when they stay very
true to their almost

01:28:35.950 --> 01:28:37.900
like what do you call that?

01:28:37.900 --> 01:28:39.250
The abstract.

01:28:39.250 --> 01:28:41.135
You know when you
read an academic text

01:28:41.135 --> 01:28:43.510
and it's really great and they
have this little abstract.

01:28:43.510 --> 01:28:45.290
Very often I think
the best abstracts

01:28:45.290 --> 01:28:48.094
are written after the
entire thing is written.

01:28:48.094 --> 01:28:49.510
But if you start
with the abstract

01:28:49.510 --> 01:28:52.264
and you try to create
an entire paper,

01:28:52.264 --> 01:28:53.680
you're going to
fail in some ways,

01:28:53.680 --> 01:28:57.310
because you're too
attached to your thesis.

01:28:57.310 --> 01:28:59.090
You could be wrong.

01:28:59.090 --> 01:29:01.480
So what I'm trying to
encourage you to do,

01:29:01.480 --> 01:29:03.260
and this is going of
sound really nutty,

01:29:03.260 --> 01:29:05.750
but maybe you've
never had an affair.

01:29:09.070 --> 01:29:09.760
Don't tell me.

01:29:12.970 --> 01:29:15.700
Maybe somebody in this
room has had an affair

01:29:15.700 --> 01:29:18.190
or has thought about
having an affair.

01:29:18.190 --> 01:29:20.849
And I'm not encouraging
you to do that.

01:29:20.849 --> 01:29:21.640
They're very messy.

01:29:21.640 --> 01:29:24.770
I have interviewed so many
people who've had affairs.

01:29:24.770 --> 01:29:28.510
It's not pretty and very rarely
is it worthwhile that I have

01:29:28.510 --> 01:29:30.380
learned from these interviews.

01:29:30.380 --> 01:29:32.650
But let's say you're
about to have an affair

01:29:32.650 --> 01:29:37.300
and you feel the
sense of penalty

01:29:37.300 --> 01:29:40.030
that's swinging like the sword
of Damocles over your head.

01:29:40.030 --> 01:29:42.700
I should not have this affair.

01:29:42.700 --> 01:29:44.560
And yet you want to.

01:29:44.560 --> 01:29:47.770
I want you to be attracted
to your manuscript like that.

01:29:52.310 --> 01:29:55.250
So forget the affair.

01:29:55.250 --> 01:30:00.080
I want you to be so
hot about your work

01:30:00.080 --> 01:30:02.420
that you want to go back to it.

01:30:02.420 --> 01:30:05.220
That you would get up early in
the morning and go to the gym.

01:30:05.220 --> 01:30:08.600
That you would save your pennies
and buy yourself a negligee.

01:30:08.600 --> 01:30:13.630
I want you to have this kind of
sense of it has to be worth it.

01:30:13.630 --> 01:30:17.780
It has to be so incredibly
scintillating and pleasurable

01:30:17.780 --> 01:30:20.420
and attractive to you.

01:30:20.420 --> 01:30:23.870
And then you will work
out a lot of stuff.

01:30:23.870 --> 01:30:25.820
So you'll have the
drafting, but you'll

01:30:25.820 --> 01:30:27.350
have the metaphysical questions.

01:30:27.350 --> 01:30:29.690
And I think that you
will create a good shape.

01:30:29.690 --> 01:30:32.450
And if you're that
into it, I assure you,

01:30:32.450 --> 01:30:35.120
you will have readers.

01:30:35.120 --> 01:30:37.490
And that really comes down
to managing expectations.

01:30:37.490 --> 01:30:41.420
I think that whether you have
10 readers, 50 readers, 500

01:30:41.420 --> 01:30:44.090
readers, or 10,000
readers, I think

01:30:44.090 --> 01:30:46.820
you're really lucky if you
have passionate readers.

01:30:46.820 --> 01:30:47.750
It's not the number.

01:30:47.750 --> 01:30:49.760
It's the quality.

01:30:49.760 --> 01:30:55.190
So that's my suggestion
for revision.

01:30:55.190 --> 01:30:57.920
Maybe we have time
for one last question.

01:30:57.920 --> 01:31:00.890
Goodness, and now
there are 15 hands.

01:31:00.890 --> 01:31:02.335
It was the affair.

01:31:02.335 --> 01:31:04.460
[LAUGHTER]

01:31:04.460 --> 01:31:05.000
Yes ma'am.

01:31:08.080 --> 01:31:10.690
Hi, my name is Gina.

01:31:10.690 --> 01:31:12.730
I'm an undergrad as well.

01:31:12.730 --> 01:31:16.900
I was wondering how your
experience as a Korean American

01:31:16.900 --> 01:31:21.220
influenced you in
writing the book.

01:31:21.220 --> 01:31:24.340
Because even though it's
a separate very different

01:31:24.340 --> 01:31:27.430
experiences, like Korean
American and Korean Japanese,

01:31:27.430 --> 01:31:30.730
you're both I guess
sort of foreigners

01:31:30.730 --> 01:31:33.280
in a place where a
majority of people

01:31:33.280 --> 01:31:36.804
are not of your ethnicity.

01:31:36.804 --> 01:31:38.970
So I was wondering if you
speak a little about that.

01:31:38.970 --> 01:31:40.090
Sure.

01:31:40.090 --> 01:31:42.820
I feel really outside.

01:31:42.820 --> 01:31:46.640
And when I was growing up, I
thought that I was outside,

01:31:46.640 --> 01:31:51.940
not just because my sisters
and I were immigrants

01:31:51.940 --> 01:31:55.030
and we were basically
working class.

01:31:55.030 --> 01:32:00.190
I think I felt outside because I
had all these social anxieties.

01:32:00.190 --> 01:32:03.520
I just really could not
fit in with other kids.

01:32:03.520 --> 01:32:06.880
So I thought that when I grew
up and if I became educated,

01:32:06.880 --> 01:32:09.130
I would find my tribe.

01:32:09.130 --> 01:32:10.520
Does that make sense?

01:32:10.520 --> 01:32:13.240
And then the only tribe that
I really made sense with

01:32:13.240 --> 01:32:14.710
were books.

01:32:14.710 --> 01:32:17.330
Like with dead people.

01:32:17.330 --> 01:32:21.430
Those books where you have the
finest version of yourself.

01:32:21.430 --> 01:32:25.061
I felt really comfortable
and safe around them.

01:32:25.061 --> 01:32:26.560
And then when I got
older, I thought

01:32:26.560 --> 01:32:30.040
maybe if I find the right
Koreans, I'll belong.

01:32:30.040 --> 01:32:32.290
And it turned out
that that's not true.

01:32:32.290 --> 01:32:35.772
I thought if I hung out with
the right kinds of people

01:32:35.772 --> 01:32:37.230
who are interested
in the world who

01:32:37.230 --> 01:32:38.980
are progressive I would belong.

01:32:38.980 --> 01:32:42.620
And that turned out that
was not true either.

01:32:42.620 --> 01:32:45.970
And then finally
I decided, oh, I'm

01:32:45.970 --> 01:32:51.530
going to have this existential
alienation, and that's OK.

01:32:51.530 --> 01:32:53.270
That's OK.

01:32:53.270 --> 01:32:56.480
And as a matter of fact,
it's a really useful lens.

01:32:56.480 --> 01:32:59.130
Because you could
take that condition.

01:32:59.130 --> 01:33:00.980
And all of us actually have it.

01:33:00.980 --> 01:33:04.190
All of us feel
existential alienation.

01:33:04.190 --> 01:33:05.690
We don't like to
admit it because it

01:33:05.690 --> 01:33:07.970
makes us feel flawed.

01:33:07.970 --> 01:33:12.110
But I have never met a person
who doesn't have that sense.

01:33:12.110 --> 01:33:14.210
Especially at some stage
in his or her life,

01:33:14.210 --> 01:33:16.940
they have that
feeling of why am I

01:33:16.940 --> 01:33:20.930
not fitting in with the
person who loves me even?

01:33:20.930 --> 01:33:22.530
You can be married
and have families

01:33:22.530 --> 01:33:27.080
and you can still feel
the sense of unease.

01:33:27.080 --> 01:33:29.150
But going back to what
you said is that it

01:33:29.150 --> 01:33:30.530
does provide this sort of lens.

01:33:30.530 --> 01:33:35.160
Because when you figure that
out, it could make you angry.

01:33:35.160 --> 01:33:36.650
It could make you
so angry that you

01:33:36.650 --> 01:33:39.245
will kill 10 people in Toronto.

01:33:42.620 --> 01:33:46.580
Or it could make you identify
with other people and say,

01:33:46.580 --> 01:33:48.110
I'm lonely.

01:33:48.110 --> 01:33:50.840
It takes great courage
to say I'm lonely.

01:33:50.840 --> 01:33:53.870
But it shouldn't, because
everybody is fucking lonely.

01:33:56.780 --> 01:33:58.472
So I always find that
to be interesting

01:33:58.472 --> 01:33:59.930
when I meet younger
people and they

01:33:59.930 --> 01:34:02.840
have that sense of discomfort.

01:34:02.840 --> 01:34:07.250
You're actually totally
normal, and you're

01:34:07.250 --> 01:34:10.460
supposed to feel this,
and we have a name for it.

01:34:13.640 --> 01:34:16.370
And it can be a super power.

01:34:16.370 --> 01:34:20.990
It can make you radically
sympathetic and empathic

01:34:20.990 --> 01:34:25.040
with other people in the world.

01:34:25.040 --> 01:34:30.920
So I do feel different
because of my--

01:34:30.920 --> 01:34:31.940
I did feel different.

01:34:31.940 --> 01:34:34.250
And I really thought it
was the obvious things

01:34:34.250 --> 01:34:37.670
like class and race,
ethnicity, citizenship.

01:34:37.670 --> 01:34:40.856
But then I just realized
no, I'm just odd.

01:34:40.856 --> 01:34:44.030
[LAUGHS] And it was
sort of a relief.

01:34:47.440 --> 01:34:49.685
That seems like a
great place to stop.

01:34:49.685 --> 01:34:51.230
Min, thank you so much.

01:34:51.230 --> 01:34:51.830
Thank you.

01:34:51.830 --> 01:34:54.580
[APPLAUSE]
