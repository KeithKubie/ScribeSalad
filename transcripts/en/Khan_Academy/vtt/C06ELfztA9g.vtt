00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:02.080
- [Voiceover] Consider
the differential equation,

00:00:02.080 --> 00:00:03.780
the derivative of y with respect to x

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:05.662
is equal to 2x minus y.

00:00:05.662 --> 00:00:07.420
"On the axes provided,

00:00:07.420 --> 00:00:10.570
"sketch a slope field for the
given differential equation

00:00:10.570 --> 00:00:12.400
"at the six points indicated."

00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:16.140
And we see one, two, three,
four, five, six points.

00:00:16.140 --> 00:00:18.080
And so what I can do is,

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:19.922
let me set up a table, actually.

00:00:19.922 --> 00:00:22.320
Let me set up a table with three columns.

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:25.133
One for x,

00:00:25.133 --> 00:00:27.880
one for y,

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:31.040
and then one for the derivative of y

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:32.640
with respect to x,

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:34.570
which this differential equation tells us

00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:36.182
in terms of x and y.

00:00:36.182 --> 00:00:37.920
And so we can look at
the different points,

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:39.360
this point right over here

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:42.440
when x is one

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:44.750
and y is two.

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:47.430
x is one, y is two.

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:51.160
Well, the derivative, they
tell us is two times x minus y.

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:54.350
So this is 2x minus y.

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:58.560
So it's gonna be two times one minus two,

00:00:58.560 --> 00:01:02.001
which is equal to zero.

00:01:02.001 --> 00:01:04.990
And so, if the derivative
there is equal to zero,

00:01:04.990 --> 00:01:07.840
then if I were to draw a line

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:11.100
that indicates the slope at that point,

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:13.440
well I would draw a
line with a zero slope.

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:17.881
It would look something like,

00:01:17.881 --> 00:01:19.649
let me draw it a little bit,

00:01:19.649 --> 00:01:22.911
it would look something like that.

00:01:22.911 --> 00:01:24.430
All right, let's keep going.

00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:25.540
Let's look at this point.

00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:28.040
Where x is equal to
zero, y is equal to two.

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:30.350
x is equal to zero, y is equal to two.

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:35.350
The derivative is going
to be two times x minus y.

00:01:35.541 --> 00:01:38.880
So it's going to be zero minus two,

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:41.376
which is equal to negative two.

00:01:41.376 --> 00:01:43.870
So how do we draw a slope of negative two?

00:01:43.870 --> 00:01:45.420
Well, it's going to go from the top left

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:48.020
to the bottom right, it's
going to be pretty steep.

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:53.440
It might look something like that.

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:56.540
That looks like a slope of negative,

00:01:56.540 --> 00:01:59.889
let me try to draw it a little bit better.

00:01:59.889 --> 00:02:02.920
So I could draw it...

00:02:04.150 --> 00:02:05.864
Well, that's pretty good.

00:02:05.864 --> 00:02:08.140
Maybe I shouldn't use my line tool,

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:10.712
let me just try to draw a reasonable,

00:02:10.712 --> 00:02:12.610
so if I have a slope of negative two

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:13.740
as I move one to the right,

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:15.070
I move two down.

00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:17.810
So it should look something like,

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:20.829
something like that.

00:02:20.829 --> 00:02:22.430
All right, let's keep going.

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:23.860
x one, y one.

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:25.570
x is one, y is one.

00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:28.991
It's gonna be two times one minus one.

00:02:28.991 --> 00:02:30.850
So this is two minus one.

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:33.292
It's gonna have a slope of one.

00:02:33.292 --> 00:02:37.940
And so that would look something like,

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:40.400
a slope of one looks something like that.

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:42.780
Let me just draw it by hand.

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:44.142
That's actually easier.

00:02:44.142 --> 00:02:46.920
And then we have x is zero, y is one.

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:48.750
x is zero, y is one.

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:53.230
Slope is gonna be two
times zero minus one,

00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:55.750
which is equal to negative one.

00:02:55.750 --> 00:02:59.330
So now the slope is negative one.

00:02:59.330 --> 00:03:02.200
And just like that,
notice it's less negative

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:04.910
than up here, it's less steep.

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:08.450
And then let's go to x is one,

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:10.080
y is negative one.

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:12.420
x is one, y is negative one.

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:16.851
So it's gonna be two times
one minus negative one.

00:03:16.851 --> 00:03:19.820
So this is two plus one.

00:03:19.820 --> 00:03:22.080
This is equal to positive three.

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:25.940
So here, the slope, it's
going to be even steeper,

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:27.935
but now in the positive sense.

00:03:27.935 --> 00:03:31.835
So a slope of three would
look something like that.

00:03:31.835 --> 00:03:36.658
And then finally, we have x
is zero, y is negative one.

00:03:36.658 --> 00:03:40.550
It's gonna be two times
zero minus negative one,

00:03:40.550 --> 00:03:42.870
which is going to be
equal to a slope of one,

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:45.330
which is going to look like this.

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:46.920
It should be the same,
it should be parallel

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:49.053
to what we have right over there.

00:03:49.053 --> 00:03:50.330
And we're done.

00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:52.067
All right, let's do part B now.

00:03:52.067 --> 00:03:54.960
Find the second derivative
of y with respect to x

00:03:54.960 --> 00:03:56.340
in terms of x and y.

00:03:56.340 --> 00:03:59.160
Determine the concavity of all solutions

00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:02.190
for the given differential
equation in quadrant two.

00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:04.921
Give a reason for your answer.

00:04:04.921 --> 00:04:07.150
All right, so first let's just
find the second derivative.

00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:10.514
So we already know that dy,

00:04:10.514 --> 00:04:13.350
let me give myself a little
bit more space, actually.

00:04:13.350 --> 00:04:17.180
We already know that the
derivative of y with respect to x

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:21.331
is equal to 2x minus y.

00:04:21.331 --> 00:04:22.700
Now, to find the second derivative,

00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:25.010
I just wanna take the
derivative of both sides of this

00:04:25.010 --> 00:04:26.577
with respect to x.

00:04:26.577 --> 00:04:27.738
So let's do that.

00:04:27.738 --> 00:04:31.302
So I could take the derivative
of the left-hand side

00:04:31.302 --> 00:04:35.736
with respect to x, and the
derivative of the right-hand side

00:04:35.736 --> 00:04:38.463
with respect to x.

00:04:38.463 --> 00:04:39.960
And so what is this going to be?

00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:41.090
Well, on the left-hand side,

00:04:41.090 --> 00:04:44.350
the notation would just
be the second derivative

00:04:44.350 --> 00:04:47.899
of y with respect to x.

00:04:47.899 --> 00:04:49.920
And then over here,
let's take the derivative

00:04:49.920 --> 00:04:51.450
of each of these with respect to x.

00:04:51.450 --> 00:04:53.910
The derivative of 2x with respect to x

00:04:53.910 --> 00:04:55.944
is going to be equal to two,

00:04:55.944 --> 00:04:58.760
and then minus the derivative
of y with respect to x,

00:04:58.760 --> 00:05:03.580
well, it's just gonna be
minus the derivative of y

00:05:03.580 --> 00:05:06.910
with respect to x.

00:05:08.660 --> 00:05:10.410
So we could say, okay, we
found the second derivative,

00:05:10.410 --> 00:05:13.480
but remember, they're
saying in terms of x and y.

00:05:13.480 --> 00:05:16.830
Right now I've found the
second derivative in terms of,

00:05:16.830 --> 00:05:18.560
well, in terms of a constant,

00:05:18.560 --> 00:05:20.950
and in terms of the first derivative.

00:05:20.950 --> 00:05:22.930
And so we can substitute our expression

00:05:22.930 --> 00:05:24.580
for the first derivative back here

00:05:24.580 --> 00:05:27.133
to have this expression
in terms of x and y.

00:05:27.133 --> 00:05:29.540
And so, this is all going to be equal to,

00:05:29.540 --> 00:05:30.280
let me write it over here.

00:05:30.280 --> 00:05:34.196
The second derivative
of y with respect to x

00:05:34.196 --> 00:05:38.074
is going to be equal to two minus,

00:05:38.074 --> 00:05:39.980
well, the derivative
of y with respect to x,

00:05:39.980 --> 00:05:42.160
we already know is 2x minus y.

00:05:42.160 --> 00:05:44.940
2x minus y.

00:05:44.940 --> 00:05:47.480
And so this is going to be equal to

00:05:47.480 --> 00:05:52.056
two minus 2x plus y.

00:05:52.056 --> 00:05:53.633
Plus y.

00:05:53.633 --> 00:05:56.260
And then they say, determine the concavity

00:05:56.260 --> 00:05:58.840
of all solutions for the
given differential equation

00:05:58.840 --> 00:06:00.180
in quadrant two.

00:06:00.180 --> 00:06:02.856
Remember, if you're thinking
about our coordinate axes,

00:06:02.856 --> 00:06:04.610
if you think about our coordinate axes,

00:06:04.610 --> 00:06:07.270
so if that's our y-axis,
that is our x-axis,

00:06:07.270 --> 00:06:08.680
this is quadrant one,

00:06:08.680 --> 00:06:10.280
this is quadrant two,

00:06:10.280 --> 00:06:11.910
this is quadrant three,

00:06:11.910 --> 00:06:13.760
and this is quadrant four.

00:06:13.760 --> 00:06:15.460
So they're talking about quadrant two.

00:06:15.460 --> 00:06:18.190
What do we know about x
and y in quadrant two?

00:06:18.190 --> 00:06:20.710
We know x is less than zero,

00:06:20.710 --> 00:06:23.734
and we know y is greater than zero.

00:06:23.734 --> 00:06:26.350
So quadrant two, let's write like this.

00:06:26.350 --> 00:06:29.720
Quadrant two.

00:06:29.720 --> 00:06:32.390
We know x is less than zero,

00:06:32.390 --> 00:06:36.173
and y is greater than zero.

00:06:36.173 --> 00:06:40.370
And so, if that is the case, so if we get,

00:06:40.370 --> 00:06:43.943
so we have two minus 2x plus y.

00:06:43.943 --> 00:06:46.340
So this is going to be,
this right over here

00:06:46.340 --> 00:06:47.983
is gonna be greater than zero.

00:06:47.983 --> 00:06:52.790
And negative two times a negative value,

00:06:52.790 --> 00:06:55.394
well, this is also going
to be greater than zero.

00:06:55.394 --> 00:06:58.000
So quadrant two, because of this,

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:00.320
that means if this is,

00:07:00.320 --> 00:07:02.040
this whole expression
is going to be positive,

00:07:02.040 --> 00:07:04.500
negative two times a negative
number is gonna be positive,

00:07:04.500 --> 00:07:05.980
plus a positive, plus a positive

00:07:05.980 --> 00:07:07.235
is going to be positive.

00:07:07.235 --> 00:07:09.302
So the second derivative

00:07:09.302 --> 00:07:13.300
second derivative with
respect to x is positive.

00:07:13.300 --> 00:07:14.480
Positive.

00:07:16.230 --> 00:07:18.100
Which means that our slope

00:07:18.100 --> 00:07:20.820
is increasing over that interval,

00:07:20.820 --> 00:07:23.220
which means that we have positive,

00:07:23.220 --> 00:07:26.660
we could say that our
con-kuh, our concavity,

00:07:26.660 --> 00:07:28.240
I always have trouble saying that.

00:07:30.270 --> 00:07:33.913
Concavity is upwards.

00:07:33.913 --> 00:07:35.080
Upwards.

00:07:35.080 --> 00:07:37.480
And if you ever forget whether, okay,

00:07:37.480 --> 00:07:39.010
a second derivative being positive,

00:07:39.010 --> 00:07:40.900
is that concavity upwards or downwards?

00:07:40.900 --> 00:07:44.260
I always just like to draw kind of our,

00:07:44.260 --> 00:07:46.490
you know, the canonical concave upwards

00:07:46.490 --> 00:07:48.150
or concave downwards,

00:07:48.150 --> 00:07:50.510
and you can see here that your slope,

00:07:50.510 --> 00:07:52.890
your slope here is turning less negative.

00:07:52.890 --> 00:07:55.580
Or you could say it's
becoming more positive.

00:07:55.580 --> 00:07:56.630
It's increasing.

00:07:56.630 --> 00:08:00.320
And it continues to increase
when you are concave upwards.

00:08:00.320 --> 00:08:02.060
So second derivative positive?

00:08:02.060 --> 00:08:04.100
You are concave upwards.

00:08:04.100 --> 00:08:05.600
Second derivative negative?

00:08:05.600 --> 00:08:08.964
You are going to be concave downwards.

00:08:08.964 --> 00:08:11.100
I'll get rid of this 'cause
you wouldn't put that

00:08:11.100 --> 00:08:12.960
on the actual AP test.
