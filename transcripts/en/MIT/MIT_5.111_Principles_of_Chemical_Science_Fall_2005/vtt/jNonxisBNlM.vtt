00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.655
All right.
Let's get going.

00:00:08.655 --> 00:00:13.048
Where were we?
We were at the point where we

00:00:13.048 --> 00:00:19.586
started out the course wondering
about the structure of the atom,

00:00:19.586 --> 00:00:25.000
how the electron and the
nucleus hung together.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:29.491
And we saw that we could not
explain how that nucleus and

00:00:29.491 --> 00:00:33.021
electron hung together using
classical ideas,

00:00:33.021 --> 00:00:36.310
classical physics,
classical mechanics and

00:00:36.310 --> 00:00:40.802
classical electromagnetism.
And so we put that discussion

00:00:40.802 --> 00:00:45.534
aside and started to talk about
the wave-particle duality of

00:00:45.534 --> 00:00:49.304
light and matter.
And we saw that both light and

00:00:49.304 --> 00:00:55.000
matter can behave as a wave or
it can behave as a particle.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:59.891
And we needed that discussion
in order to come back to talk

00:00:59.891 --> 00:01:04.192
about the structure of the atom.
And, in particular,

00:01:04.192 --> 00:01:09.337
what was so important last time
that we met is that we saw the

00:01:09.337 --> 00:01:12.626
results of an experiment,
that Davidson,

00:01:12.626 --> 00:01:17.265
Germer, and George Thompson
experiment that demonstrated

00:01:17.265 --> 00:01:21.903
that massive particles could
exhibit wave-like behavior.

00:01:21.903 --> 00:01:26.963
We saw the interference pattern
of electrons reflected from a

00:01:26.963 --> 00:01:32.678
nickel single crystal.
An actual original paper that

00:01:32.678 --> 00:01:36.095
reports that result is on our
website.

00:01:36.095 --> 00:01:39.328
You're welcome to take a look
at it.

00:01:39.328 --> 00:01:44.407
But that really was the
impetus, this observation of the

00:01:44.407 --> 00:01:49.764
wave-like behavior of matter.
That was the impetus for this

00:01:49.764 --> 00:01:54.012
gentleman here,
Erwin Schrödinger in 1926-27 to

00:01:54.012 --> 00:01:59.000
write down an equation of motion
for waves.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:04.644
That is, he thought maybe the
answer here is that if particles

00:02:04.644 --> 00:02:09.549
can behave like waves,
then maybe we have to treat the

00:02:09.549 --> 00:02:14.453
wave-like nature of particles,
the wave-like nature of

00:02:14.453 --> 00:02:19.635
electrons, in particular in the
case when the wavelength,

00:02:19.635 --> 00:02:24.910
the de Broglie wavelength of
the particle or the electron,

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:30.000
is comparable to the size of
its environment.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:34.960
Maybe in those cases we have to
use a different kind of equation

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:37.795
of motion, a wave equation of
motion.

00:02:37.795 --> 00:02:41.417
And that is what he did.
So, he wrote down this

00:02:41.417 --> 00:02:44.330
equation.
We briefly looked at it last

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:47.086
time.
This equation has some kind of

00:02:47.086 --> 00:02:50.236
operator called the Hamiltonian
operator.

00:02:50.236 --> 00:02:53.779
It has a hat on it,
a carrot on the top of it.

00:02:53.779 --> 00:02:58.425
That tells us it is an operator
that operates on this thing,

00:02:58.425 --> 00:03:02.271
psi.
That psi is what's going to

00:03:02.271 --> 00:03:05.803
represent our particle.
That psi is a wave.

00:03:05.803 --> 00:03:10.850
Since we're going to give it a
functional form in another day

00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:14.635
or so, we're going to call it a
wave function.

00:03:14.635 --> 00:03:18.000
Somehow that psi represents our
particle.

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:22.710
Exactly how it represents our
particle is something we're

00:03:22.710 --> 00:03:27.000
going to talk about again in a
few days.

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:31.771
But right now the important
thing is to realize that this

00:03:31.771 --> 00:03:36.714
psi represents the presence of a
particle, in this case the

00:03:36.714 --> 00:03:39.952
electron.
And when H operates on psi we

00:03:39.952 --> 00:03:43.446
get back psi.
We do this operation and out

00:03:43.446 --> 00:03:47.110
comes psi again,
the original wave function,

00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:49.837
but it's multiplied by
something.

00:03:49.837 --> 00:03:54.353
That something is the energy.
It's the binding energy.

00:03:54.353 --> 00:03:58.954
It's the energy with which the
electron is bound to the

00:03:58.954 --> 00:04:03.966
nucleus.
This equation is an equation of

00:04:03.966 --> 00:04:06.453
motion.
This wave equation,

00:04:06.453 --> 00:04:10.759
Schršdinger's equation,
is to this new kind of

00:04:10.759 --> 00:04:15.447
mechanics, called quantum
mechanics, like Newton's

00:04:15.447 --> 00:04:20.135
equation of motion,
and I show you just the second

00:04:20.135 --> 00:04:23.580
law here, are to classical
mechanics.

00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:29.320
This equation here tells us how
psi changes with position and

00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:34.432
also with time.
It tells us something about

00:04:34.432 --> 00:04:39.837
where the electron is and also
tells us where the electron is

00:04:39.837 --> 00:04:44.252
as a function of time.
It's an equation of motion.

00:04:44.252 --> 00:04:49.657
And this is what Schrödinger
realized, is that maybe when the

00:04:49.657 --> 00:04:54.882
wavelength of a particle is on
the order of the size of its

00:04:54.882 --> 00:05:00.378
environment, you have to treat
it with a different equation of

00:05:00.378 --> 00:05:04.634
motion. You can 
no longer use F equals ma,

00:05:04.634 --> 00:05:08.147
this classical equation of

00:05:08.147 --> 00:05:11.133
motion.
You have to use a different

00:05:11.133 --> 00:05:14.909
equation of motion.
And that's Schršdinger's

00:05:14.909 --> 00:05:20.002
equation, this wave equation.
Can we dim the front lights a

00:05:20.002 --> 00:05:23.427
little bit?
Because the screen is just a

00:05:23.427 --> 00:05:26.150
little bit hard to see,
I think.

00:05:26.150 --> 00:05:30.892
We are going to let our
electron be represented by this

00:05:30.892 --> 00:05:35.980
wave psi.
And so psi, since it's going to

00:05:35.980 --> 00:05:41.173
be representing the electron,
this psi is going to be a

00:05:41.173 --> 00:05:45.596
function of some position
coordinates and also,

00:05:45.596 --> 00:05:49.538
in the broadest sense,
a function of time.

00:05:49.538 --> 00:05:54.826
Now we of course can label psi
in Cartesian coordinates,

00:05:54.826 --> 00:05:58.000
giving it an x,
y and z.

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:01.470
If I gave you x,
y and z for this electron in

00:06:01.470 --> 00:06:05.966
this kind of coordinate system
where the nucleus is at the

00:06:05.966 --> 00:06:10.068
origin of the coordinate system,
if I give you the x,

00:06:10.068 --> 00:06:13.933
y and z coordinates,
you'd know where the electron

00:06:13.933 --> 00:06:16.300
was.
But it turns out that this

00:06:16.300 --> 00:06:21.190
problem of the hydrogen atom is
really impossible to solve if I

00:06:21.190 --> 00:06:23.793
use a Cartesian coordinate
system.

00:06:23.793 --> 00:06:29.000
So, I am going to use a
spherical coordinate system.

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:33.862
How many of you are familiar
and have used a spherical

00:06:33.862 --> 00:06:37.348
coordinate system before?
A few of you.

00:06:37.348 --> 00:06:40.743
Not all of you.
Well, it's not hard to

00:06:40.743 --> 00:06:44.321
understand.
And it is important that you

00:06:44.321 --> 00:06:48.449
understand it.
So, instead of giving you an x,

00:06:48.449 --> 00:06:52.853
y and z to locate this
electron, this particle in

00:06:52.853 --> 00:06:59.000
space, we're going to give you
an r, a theta and a phi.

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:03.374
And the definitions of r,
theta and phi are the

00:07:03.374 --> 00:07:06.987
following.
If here is my nucleus at the

00:07:06.987 --> 00:07:12.407
origin and here is the electron,
r is the distance of that

00:07:12.407 --> 00:07:17.542
electron from the nucleus.
It's just the length of this

00:07:17.542 --> 00:07:21.156
line right here.
That's one coordinate.

00:07:21.156 --> 00:07:26.766
A second coordinate is theta.
Theta is the angle that this r

00:07:26.766 --> 00:07:32.525
makes from the Z-axis.
And then the third coordinate

00:07:32.525 --> 00:07:34.963
is phi.
Phi is the following.

00:07:34.963 --> 00:07:40.276
If I take that electron and I
just drop a perpendicular to the

00:07:40.276 --> 00:07:45.414
x,y-plane, and I then draw a
line in the x,y-plane from that

00:07:45.414 --> 00:07:50.639
point of intersection to the
origin, the angle that that line

00:07:50.639 --> 00:07:53.513
makes with the x-axis here is
phi.

00:07:53.513 --> 00:07:59.000
So, I am going to give you an
r, a theta, and a phi.

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:04.358
r is just the distance of the
electron from the nucleus.

00:08:04.358 --> 00:08:10.008
Theta and phi tell us something
about the angular position.

00:08:10.008 --> 00:08:14.002
And then, as I said,
in the largest sense,

00:08:14.002 --> 00:08:18.484
there is also time.
But we'll talk about time a

00:08:18.484 --> 00:08:22.868
little bit later.
Psi represents our electron.

00:08:22.868 --> 00:08:27.934
Now, what does the Schrödinger
equation specifically,

00:08:27.934 --> 00:08:33.000
for a hydrogen atom,
actually look like?

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:38.518
This H psi times E psi is the
kind of generic Schrödinger

00:08:38.518 --> 00:08:42.164
equation.
And now we've got to write a

00:08:42.164 --> 00:08:46.302
specific one,
one specific for the hydrogen

00:08:46.302 --> 00:08:49.653
atom.
We need to know what this is,

00:08:49.653 --> 00:08:52.116
H.
That's our Hamiltonian,

00:08:52.116 --> 00:08:56.156
our operator.
And so the operator here for

00:08:56.156 --> 00:09:02.665
that hydrogen atom is this.
What is it is essentially three

00:09:02.665 --> 00:09:06.879
second derivatives,
one here is with respect to r,

00:09:06.879 --> 00:09:11.867
a second is a second derivative
effectively with respect to

00:09:11.867 --> 00:09:15.995
theta, and another one,
the final one is a second

00:09:15.995 --> 00:09:19.950
derivative with respect to phi.
In other words,

00:09:19.950 --> 00:09:23.820
if this whole Hamiltonian is
operating on psi,

00:09:23.820 --> 00:09:28.292
what you're going to do is
essentially take the first

00:09:28.292 --> 00:09:33.538
derivative of psi with respect
to r, multiply it by r squared,

00:09:33.538 --> 00:09:36.566
--
-- and then take a first

00:09:36.566 --> 00:09:40.417
derivative with respect to r
again and multiple it by 1 over

00:09:40.417 --> 00:09:42.702
r squared.

00:09:42.702 --> 00:09:46.357
And add to that the
first derivative of psi with

00:09:46.357 --> 00:09:49.229
respect to theta multiplied by
psi and theta, etc.

00:09:51.449 --> 00:09:55.300
You don't have to know this.
I'm just showing this to you so

00:09:55.300 --> 00:09:58.433
you recognize it later on.
This is a differential

00:09:58.433 --> 00:10:01.875
equation.
In 18.03, you learned how to

00:10:01.875 --> 00:10:04.151
solve these differential
equations.

00:10:04.151 --> 00:10:07.500
And then there is another very
important term here,

00:10:07.500 --> 00:10:09.977
so it's all of this plus this,
u of r.

00:10:09.977 --> 00:10:12.120
What is u(r)?
Potential energy of

00:10:12.120 --> 00:10:14.732
interaction.
And the potential energy of

00:10:14.732 --> 00:10:18.348
interaction, of course,
is the Coulomb potential energy

00:10:18.348 --> 00:10:20.959
right here, 1 over r
dependence.

00:10:20.959 --> 00:10:23.370
We've talked about the Coulomb
force.

00:10:23.370 --> 00:10:27.522
This is the potential energy of
interaction that corresponds to

00:10:27.522 --> 00:10:32.307
the Coulomb force.
So, that's the specific

00:10:32.307 --> 00:10:36.522
Schrödinger equation for the
hydrogen atom.

00:10:36.522 --> 00:10:42.543
Now, what we have got to do is
we have to solve this equation

00:10:42.543 --> 00:10:47.259
for the hydrogen atom.
And when I say solve this

00:10:47.259 --> 00:10:52.678
equation, what I mean is we're
going to have to find E,

00:10:52.678 --> 00:10:59.000
these binding energies of the
electron to the nucleus.

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:04.221
That is part of our goal when
we say solve this differential

00:11:04.221 --> 00:11:09.176
equation is knowing what E is,
is figuring out what E is.

00:11:09.176 --> 00:11:13.070
And, actually,
this is what we're going to do

00:11:13.070 --> 00:11:18.380
today, finding those energies.
But then the second goal is to

00:11:18.380 --> 00:11:21.566
find psi.
We want to find what is the

00:11:21.566 --> 00:11:26.699
functional form of psi that
represents the electron and the

00:11:26.699 --> 00:11:31.526
hydrogen atom?
Therefore, we're going to want

00:11:31.526 --> 00:11:34.389
to find the wave functions for
psi.

00:11:34.389 --> 00:11:38.010
And, you know what,
those wave functions are

00:11:38.010 --> 00:11:42.052
nothing other than what you
already sort of know,

00:11:42.052 --> 00:11:46.431
and that is orbitals.
You talked in high school about

00:11:46.431 --> 00:11:49.799
s orbitals and p orbitals and d
orbitals.

00:11:49.799 --> 00:11:54.178
Those orbitals are nothing
other than wave functions.

00:11:54.178 --> 00:11:58.557
They come from solving
Schršdinger's equation for the

00:11:58.557 --> 00:12:03.418
hydrogen atom.
That's where they come from.

00:12:03.418 --> 00:12:07.651
Now, specifically,
the orbital is something called

00:12:07.651 --> 00:12:12.747
the spatial part of the wave
function as opposed to the spin

00:12:12.747 --> 00:12:15.166
part.
But for all intents and

00:12:15.166 --> 00:12:19.830
purposes they are the same.
We're actually going to use

00:12:19.830 --> 00:12:24.149
these terms interchangeably,
orbital wave function,

00:12:24.149 --> 00:12:29.237
wave function orbital.
The bottom line is that when

00:12:29.237 --> 00:12:33.952
you solve Schršdinger's equation
for the energy and the wave

00:12:33.952 --> 00:12:38.667
function, it makes predictions
for the energies and the wave

00:12:38.667 --> 00:12:42.023
functions that agree with our
observations,

00:12:42.023 --> 00:12:46.578
as we're going to see today,
in particular for the case of

00:12:46.578 --> 00:12:50.654
the binding energies of the
electron to the nucleus.

00:12:50.654 --> 00:12:54.809
This equation predicts having a
stable hydrogen atom,

00:12:54.809 --> 00:12:59.444
a hydrogen atom that seemingly
lives forever in contrast to

00:12:59.444 --> 00:13:04.000
when we use classical equations
of motion.

00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:07.757
When we used classical
equations of motion we got a

00:13:07.757 --> 00:13:11.514
hydrogen atom that lived for all
of 10^-10 seconds.

00:13:11.514 --> 00:13:16.023
But here we finally have some
way to understand the stability

00:13:16.023 --> 00:13:19.404
of the hydrogen atom.
It makes the Schrödinger

00:13:19.404 --> 00:13:24.063
equation, it makes predictions
that agree with our observations

00:13:24.063 --> 00:13:26.994
of the world we live in.
And, therefore,

00:13:26.994 --> 00:13:30.975
we believe it to be correct.
That is it.

00:13:30.975 --> 00:13:34.879
It agrees with the observations
that we make.

00:13:34.879 --> 00:13:38.693
Let's start.
And we're actually not going to

00:13:38.693 --> 00:13:42.951
solve the equation,
as I said, but you will do so

00:13:42.951 --> 00:13:47.120
if you take 5.61,
which is the quantum course in

00:13:47.120 --> 00:13:50.048
chemistry, or 8.04,
I think it is,

00:13:50.048 --> 00:13:54.661
which is the quantum course in
physics after you take

00:13:54.661 --> 00:13:59.274
differential equations,
so that you know how to solve

00:13:59.274 --> 00:14:05.724
the differential equations.
But we're going to write down

00:14:05.724 --> 00:14:11.456
the solution in particular here
for E, the binding energies of

00:14:11.456 --> 00:14:16.906
the electrons to the nucleus.
Now we're going to need this.

00:14:16.906 --> 00:14:22.543
We've got H psi equals E psi.
And when we

00:14:22.543 --> 00:14:27.335
solve that equation,
we get the following expression

00:14:27.335 --> 00:14:33.837
for E, these binding energies.
E is equal to 1 over n squared

00:14:33.837 --> 00:14:39.229
times m e^4 over 8 epsilon
nought squared times h squared.

00:14:39.229 --> 00:14:44.810
That is what we get out of it.
And there is a minus sign out

00:14:44.810 --> 00:14:47.837
in front.

00:14:47.837 --> 00:14:51.054
Now, what is m?

00:14:51.054 --> 00:14:54.837
m is the mass of the electron.
What is e?

00:14:54.837 --> 00:14:57.770
e is the charge on the
electron.

00:14:57.770 --> 00:15:02.689
Epsilon nought is this
permittivity of vacuum that we

00:15:02.689 --> 00:15:08.148
talked about before.
It's really just a unit

00:15:08.148 --> 00:15:12.633
conversation factor here.
h is Planck's constant.

00:15:12.633 --> 00:15:15.809
Here comes Planck's constant
again.

00:15:15.809 --> 00:15:18.892
It is ubiquitous.
It's everywhere.

00:15:18.892 --> 00:15:23.750
And what we do is that we
typically take all of these

00:15:23.750 --> 00:15:28.795
constants and group them
together into another constant

00:15:28.795 --> 00:15:33.000
that we call the Rydberg
constant.

00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:38.581
And we denote it as a capital R
sub capital H.

00:15:38.581 --> 00:15:45.155
All of that is equal to RH,
so this is over n squared,

00:15:45.155 --> 00:15:48.627
minus 1.
And the value of RH,

00:15:48.627 --> 00:15:54.829
that Rydberg constant,
and this is something you're

00:15:54.829 --> 00:16:00.782
going to need to use a lot in
the next few weeks,

00:16:00.782 --> 00:16:07.205
is 2.17987x10^-8 joules.
But you also see,

00:16:07.205 --> 00:16:14.728
in this expression for the
binding energies of the electron

00:16:14.728 --> 00:16:20.046
to the nucleus,
that there is this n here.

00:16:20.046 --> 00:16:23.288
What's n?
N is an integer.

00:16:23.288 --> 00:16:28.606
When you solve that
differential equation,

00:16:28.606 --> 00:16:36.000
you find that n has only
certain allowed values.

00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:42.594
N can be as low as 1,
2, 3, and n can go all the way

00:16:42.594 --> 00:16:48.543
up to infinity.
N is what we call the principal

00:16:48.543 --> 00:16:51.000
quantum number.

00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:05.787
I am going to explain that a
little bit more by looking right

00:17:05.787 --> 00:17:10.996
now at an energy level diagram.
That is the expression.

00:17:10.996 --> 00:17:16.591
But now let's plot it out so
that we can understand what is

00:17:16.591 --> 00:17:21.897
going on here a little more.
We are going to be plotting

00:17:21.897 --> 00:17:26.141
this expression as n goes from 1
to infinity.

00:17:26.141 --> 00:17:33.137
I have the energy access here.
Energy is going to be going up

00:17:33.137 --> 00:17:37.215
in that direction.
When n is equal to 1,

00:17:37.215 --> 00:17:42.653
the binding energy of that
electron to the nucleus is

00:17:42.653 --> 00:17:46.000
effectively the Rydberg
constant.

00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:50.496
Here I rounded it off,
-2.180x10^-18 joules.

00:17:50.496 --> 00:17:56.039
But our expression here says
that there can be another

00:17:56.039 --> 00:18:02.000
binding energy of the electron
to the nucleus.

00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:04.706
It says that n can be equal to
2.

00:18:04.706 --> 00:18:09.105
And if n is equal to 2,
well, then the binding energy

00:18:09.105 --> 00:18:13.673
of the electron is one-quarter
of the Rydberg constant,

00:18:13.673 --> 00:18:17.818
because it is the Rydberg
constant over 2 squared.

00:18:17.818 --> 00:18:21.963
If n is equal to 3,
well, our expression says that

00:18:21.963 --> 00:18:26.954
the binding energy is minus a
ninth of the Rydberg constant.

00:18:26.954 --> 00:18:31.567
If n is equal to 4,

00:18:31.567 --> 00:18:35.445
it is minus a sixteenth of the
Rydberg constant,

00:18:35.445 --> 00:18:38.498
n is equal to 5,
minus a twenty-fifth,

00:18:38.498 --> 00:18:41.303
n equal to 6,
minus a thirty-sixth,

00:18:41.303 --> 00:18:44.026
n equal to 7,
minus a forty-ninth,

00:18:44.026 --> 00:18:46.914
all the way up to n equals
infinity.

00:18:46.914 --> 00:18:51.947
And you know what the value of
the binding energy is when n is

00:18:51.947 --> 00:18:55.000
equal to infinity?
Zero.

00:18:55.000 --> 00:19:00.186
Our equation says that the
electron can be bound to the

00:19:00.186 --> 00:19:06.045
nucleus with this much energy or
this much energy or this much

00:19:06.045 --> 00:19:10.463
energy and so on,
but it cannot be bound to the

00:19:10.463 --> 00:19:15.361
nucleus with this much energy,
somewhere in between,

00:19:15.361 --> 00:19:19.107
or this much energy or that
much energy.

00:19:19.107 --> 00:19:22.853
It has to be exactly this,
exactly this,

00:19:22.853 --> 00:19:25.926
exactly this,
so on and so forth.

00:19:25.926 --> 00:19:31.900
That is important.
What we see here is that the

00:19:31.900 --> 00:19:38.220
binding energies of the electron
to the nucleus are quantized,

00:19:38.220 --> 00:19:43.815
that that binding energy can
only have specific allowed

00:19:43.815 --> 00:19:47.648
values.
It doesn't have a continuum of

00:19:47.648 --> 00:19:52.000
values for the binding energy.
Yes?

00:19:57.000 --> 00:20:00.429
Those are identically the same
size.

00:20:00.429 --> 00:20:03.760
Because this is an operator,
right?

00:20:03.760 --> 00:20:09.051
I left the hat off here.
Remember that we took a second

00:20:09.051 --> 00:20:13.461
derivative of psi?
So, you cannot cancel this.

00:20:13.461 --> 00:20:18.164
This is an operator taking the
derivative of psi.

00:20:18.164 --> 00:20:23.553
You cannot just cancel that.
This isn't a multiply by on

00:20:23.553 --> 00:20:25.806
this side.
This side is.

00:20:25.806 --> 00:20:31.000
This is E times psi,
but not over here.

00:20:31.000 --> 00:20:35.883
That's really important.
We have these quantization of

00:20:35.883 --> 00:20:41.320
the allowed binding energies of
the electron to the nucleus.

00:20:41.320 --> 00:20:44.730
Where did that quantization
come from?

00:20:44.730 --> 00:20:49.337
That quantization came from
solving the Schrödinger

00:20:49.337 --> 00:20:52.839
equation.
It drops right out of solving

00:20:52.839 --> 00:20:58.000
the Schrödinger equation.
How did that happen?

00:20:58.000 --> 00:21:02.726
Well, in differential
equations, as you will see,

00:21:02.726 --> 00:21:08.732
when you solve a differential
equation, what you have to do to

00:21:08.732 --> 00:21:13.950
solve it so that it adequately
describes your physical

00:21:13.950 --> 00:21:19.956
situation is you have to often
impose boundary conditions onto

00:21:19.956 --> 00:21:23.796
the problem.
And it's that imposition of

00:21:23.796 --> 00:21:30.000
boundary conditions that gives
you that quantization.

00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:33.716
That is where it comes from
mathematically.

00:21:33.716 --> 00:21:37.522
In other words,
remember one of those angles

00:21:37.522 --> 00:21:40.353
that I showed you,
the phi angle?

00:21:40.353 --> 00:21:44.690
You can see it would run from
zero to 360 degrees.

00:21:44.690 --> 00:21:49.026
But you also know,
if you go 90 degrees beyond 360

00:21:49.026 --> 00:21:53.185
degrees, suppose you to go to
450 degrees, well,

00:21:53.185 --> 00:21:58.495
that should give you the same
result as if you had phi equals

00:21:58.495 --> 00:22:02.540
90.
What you have to do is you have

00:22:02.540 --> 00:22:05.737
to cut off your solution at 360
degrees.

00:22:05.737 --> 00:22:10.409
When you cut off that solution,
well, then that gives you,

00:22:10.409 --> 00:22:14.590
in these differential
equations, these quantization.

00:22:14.590 --> 00:22:17.704
That is physically where it
comes from.

00:22:17.704 --> 00:22:21.885
Again, this is not something
you're responsible for,

00:22:21.885 --> 00:22:26.475
but when you do differential
equations later on in 18.03,

00:22:26.475 --> 00:22:33.292
you will see how that happens.
Let's talk some more about

00:22:33.292 --> 00:22:38.737
these loud energy levels.
When the electron,

00:22:38.737 --> 00:22:45.576
or when n is equal to 1,
the language we use is that we

00:22:45.576 --> 00:22:52.794
say that the hydrogen atom,
or we say that the electron of

00:22:52.794 --> 00:22:59.000
the hydrogen atom,
is in the ground state.

00:22:59.000 --> 00:23:03.219
We call this the ground state
because this is the lowest

00:23:03.219 --> 00:23:06.365
energy state.
It has got the most negative

00:23:06.365 --> 00:23:09.127
energy.
It's the lowest energy state.

00:23:09.127 --> 00:23:13.731
We call n equals 1
the ground state of the hydrogen

00:23:13.731 --> 00:23:16.877
atom or the ground state for the
electron.

00:23:16.877 --> 00:23:21.020
We use those terms of the
electron or the hydrogen atom

00:23:21.020 --> 00:23:24.626
interchangeably.
Now, what's the significance of

00:23:24.626 --> 00:23:29.000
this binding energy?
And this is important.

00:23:29.000 --> 00:23:34.409
The significance is that the
binding energy is minus the

00:23:34.409 --> 00:23:38.245
ionization energy for the
hydrogen atom,

00:23:38.245 --> 00:23:43.950
because if I put this energy in
from here to there into the

00:23:43.950 --> 00:23:50.049
system, then I will be ripping
off the electron and will have a

00:23:50.049 --> 00:23:54.180
free electron.
So, the ionization energy is

00:23:54.180 --> 00:23:59.000
minus the value of this binding
energy.

00:23:59.000 --> 00:24:02.360
The ionization energy is always
positive.

00:24:02.360 --> 00:24:06.308
The binding energy,
the way we're going to treat

00:24:06.308 --> 00:24:11.265
this, is going to be negative
because the electron is bound.

00:24:11.265 --> 00:24:16.222
And then the separated limit,
the electron far away from the

00:24:16.222 --> 00:24:19.078
nucleus, well,
that energy is zero.

00:24:19.078 --> 00:24:23.531
So, the binding energy is minus
the ionization energy,

00:24:23.531 --> 00:24:27.227
or conversely,
the ionization energy is minus

00:24:27.227 --> 00:24:32.162
the binding energy.
That is the physical

00:24:32.162 --> 00:24:36.270
significance of these binding
energies.

00:24:36.270 --> 00:24:42.216
And when we talk about an
ionization energy for an atom,

00:24:42.216 --> 00:24:48.702
we are typically talking about
the ionization energy when the

00:24:48.702 --> 00:24:54.864
atom is in the ground state.
This is the ionization energy

00:24:54.864 --> 00:24:59.860
we're talking about.
But we also said that the

00:24:59.860 --> 00:25:03.358
binding energy of the electron
can be this much,

00:25:03.358 --> 00:25:06.781
meaning it's in the n equals 2
state.

00:25:06.781 --> 00:25:11.023
That can be possible also.
Not at the same time as it's in

00:25:11.023 --> 00:25:14.595
the n equals 1 state,
but you can have a hydrogen

00:25:14.595 --> 00:25:18.018
atom in a state,
which is the n equals 2 state.

00:25:18.018 --> 00:25:21.888
What that means is that the
electron is bound by less

00:25:21.888 --> 00:25:24.046
energy.
When that is the case,

00:25:24.046 --> 00:25:28.288
we talk about the hydrogen atom
being in the first excited

00:25:28.288 --> 00:25:32.178
state.
This is the ground,

00:25:32.178 --> 00:25:38.140
this is the first excited
state, but n is equal to 2.

00:25:38.140 --> 00:25:43.184
In that case,
the electron is not as strongly

00:25:43.184 --> 00:25:49.949
bound because it is going to
require less energy to rip that

00:25:49.949 --> 00:25:54.878
electron off.
The binding energy in n equals

00:25:54.878 --> 00:26:01.987
2 is minus the ionization energy
if you have a hydrogen atom in

00:26:01.987 --> 00:26:07.471
the first excited state.
Make sense to you?

00:26:07.471 --> 00:26:10.251
Yeah.
Okay, so we can have atoms in

00:26:10.251 --> 00:26:13.930
this state, too.
Then the ionization energy is

00:26:13.930 --> 00:26:16.628
less.
It takes less energy to pull

00:26:16.628 --> 00:26:19.000
the electron off.
Yes?

00:26:27.000 --> 00:26:30.953
In everything that we are going
to deal with,

00:26:30.953 --> 00:26:35.894
we are going to have binding
energies that are negative.

00:26:35.894 --> 00:26:38.859
Let's do that.
You can, of course,

00:26:38.859 --> 00:26:43.980
have a binding energy that is
positive, but the problem is

00:26:43.980 --> 00:26:47.125
that isn't a stable situation.
Okay.

00:26:47.125 --> 00:26:50.000
Good.
Other questions?

00:27:02.000 --> 00:27:04.514
Yes.
When we're dealing with a

00:27:04.514 --> 00:27:09.023
solid, we talk about a work
function as opposed to an

00:27:09.023 --> 00:27:13.271
ionization energy.
When we're dealing with an atom

00:27:13.271 --> 00:27:16.826
or a molecule,
we talk about an ionization

00:27:16.826 --> 00:27:20.121
energy as opposed to the work
function.

00:27:20.121 --> 00:27:23.589
It's really the same thing.
Historically,

00:27:23.589 --> 00:27:28.705
there is a reason for calling
the ionization energy off of a

00:27:28.705 --> 00:27:34.533
solid the work function.
Oh, one other thing.

00:27:34.533 --> 00:27:39.981
I just wanted to point out
again right here,

00:27:39.981 --> 00:27:47.203
is that when n is equal to
infinity, the binding energy is

00:27:47.203 --> 00:27:51.511
zero.
That is the ionization limit.

00:27:51.511 --> 00:28:00.000
That is when the electron is no
longer bound to the nucleus.

00:28:00.000 --> 00:28:04.926
Now, one other point here is
that this solution to the

00:28:04.926 --> 00:28:09.388
Schrödinger equation for the
hydrogen atom works.

00:28:09.388 --> 00:28:14.687
It predicts the allowed energy
levels for any one electron

00:28:14.687 --> 00:28:17.940
atom.
What do I mean by one electron

00:28:17.940 --> 00:28:21.101
atom?
Well, helium plus is

00:28:21.101 --> 00:28:25.563
one electron atom.
Because helium usually has two

00:28:25.563 --> 00:28:31.233
electrons, but if you take one
away you have only one electron

00:28:31.233 --> 00:28:35.159
left.
And so this helium plus ion,

00:28:35.159 --> 00:28:39.478
that's a one electron atom,
or if you want to say it more

00:28:39.478 --> 00:28:43.412
precisely, one electron ion.
Or, lithium double plus,

00:28:43.412 --> 00:28:47.962
that's a one electron
atom or a one electron ion.

00:28:47.962 --> 00:28:51.279
Because lithium usually has
three electrons,

00:28:51.279 --> 00:28:55.212
but if you take two away and
you only have one left,

00:28:55.212 --> 00:28:59.609
that's a one electron atom.
Uranium plus 91 is a

00:28:59.609 --> 00:29:03.804
one electron atom.
Because you took 92 of them

00:29:03.804 --> 00:29:06.946
away, one is left,
that's a one electron atom or

00:29:06.946 --> 00:29:09.218
an ion.
And the bottom line is that

00:29:09.218 --> 00:29:12.961
this expression for the energy
levels predicts all of the

00:29:12.961 --> 00:29:16.503
binding energies for one
electron atoms as long as you

00:29:16.503 --> 00:29:19.712
remember to put in the Z squared
up here.

00:29:19.712 --> 00:29:23.053
For a hydrogen atom that is,
of course, Z equals 1,

00:29:23.053 --> 00:29:28.000
so we just have minus R sub H
over n squared.

00:29:28.000 --> 00:29:31.555
But for these other one
electron atoms,

00:29:31.555 --> 00:29:36.140
you have to have the Z in
there, the charge on the

00:29:36.140 --> 00:29:37.263
nucleus.
Why?

00:29:37.263 --> 00:29:42.315
Well, because that Z comes from
the potential energy of

00:29:42.315 --> 00:29:46.339
interaction.
The Coulomb potential energy of

00:29:46.339 --> 00:29:51.672
interaction is the charge on the
electron times Z times e,

00:29:51.672 --> 00:29:57.005
the charge on the nucleus.
That is where the Z comes from.

00:29:57.005 --> 00:30:01.760
That is important.
How do we know that the

00:30:01.760 --> 00:30:06.429
Schrödinger equation is making
predictions that agree with our

00:30:06.429 --> 00:30:09.261
observations?
Well, we've got to do an

00:30:09.261 --> 00:30:12.400
experiment.
And the experiment we're going

00:30:12.400 --> 00:30:16.303
to do is we're going to take a
glass tube like this.

00:30:16.303 --> 00:30:20.666
We're going to pump it out and
we're going to fill it with

00:30:20.666 --> 00:30:24.493
hydrogen, H two.
And then in this glass tube

00:30:24.493 --> 00:30:28.397
there are two electrodes,
a positive electrode and a

00:30:28.397 --> 00:30:33.727
negative electrode.
And what I am going to do here

00:30:33.727 --> 00:30:39.363
is that I am going to crank up
the potential difference between

00:30:39.363 --> 00:30:43.545
these positive and negative
electrodes, higher,

00:30:43.545 --> 00:30:48.818
higher, higher until at a point
we're going to have the gas

00:30:48.818 --> 00:30:53.000
break down, a discharge is going
to be ignited,

00:30:53.000 --> 00:30:56.272
just like I am going to do over
here.

00:30:56.272 --> 00:31:00.000
Did I ignite a discharge?
Yes.

00:31:00.000 --> 00:31:03.658
There it is.
And the gas is going to glow.

00:31:03.658 --> 00:31:07.316
We are going to have a plasma
formed here.

00:31:07.316 --> 00:31:12.581
Oh, and what happens in this
plasma is that the H two

00:31:12.581 --> 00:31:15.615
is broken down into hydrogen
atoms.

00:31:15.615 --> 00:31:20.255
And these hydrogen atoms are
going to emit radiation.

00:31:20.255 --> 00:31:25.609
That is some of the radiation
that you're seeing here in this

00:31:25.609 --> 00:31:30.737
particular discharge lamp.
We are going to take that

00:31:30.737 --> 00:31:33.517
radiation and we're going to
disperse it.

00:31:33.517 --> 00:31:37.271
That is, we're going to send
the light to a diffraction

00:31:37.271 --> 00:31:39.495
grating.
This is kind of like the

00:31:39.495 --> 00:31:42.970
two-slit experiment.
And when you look at it you're

00:31:42.970 --> 00:31:46.724
going to see constructive and
destructive interference.

00:31:46.724 --> 00:31:50.338
But when you look at the bright
spots of constructive

00:31:50.338 --> 00:31:54.508
interference you're going to
find that those bright spots now

00:31:54.508 --> 00:31:57.636
are broken down into different
colors, purple,

00:31:57.636 --> 00:32:00.000
blue, green,
etc.

00:32:00.000 --> 00:32:03.694
And that is because the
different colors of light have

00:32:03.694 --> 00:32:07.041
different wavelengths.
And if they have different

00:32:07.041 --> 00:32:10.178
wavelengths, well,
then the points in space of

00:32:10.178 --> 00:32:13.664
maximum constructive
interference are going to be a

00:32:13.664 --> 00:32:17.010
little different.
And so we're going to literally

00:32:17.010 --> 00:32:20.984
separate the light out in space
depending on their colors.

00:32:20.984 --> 00:32:24.540
And we're going to see what
colors come out of this.

00:32:24.540 --> 00:32:28.374
And so now, in order to help
you do that, we've got some

00:32:28.374 --> 00:32:32.000
diffraction grating glasses for
you.

00:32:32.000 --> 00:32:36.492
You should put them on and look
into this light.

00:32:36.492 --> 00:32:42.227
And you will be able to see off
to your left and to the right

00:32:42.227 --> 00:32:45.000
some very distinct lines.

00:32:51.000 --> 00:32:55.064
And if you look into the lights
above, you can see all different

00:32:55.064 --> 00:32:57.000
colors from the white light.

00:33:37.000 --> 00:33:40.931
All right.
Do you see the hydrogen lamp?

00:33:40.931 --> 00:33:46.072
I know that the white lights
above the room are more

00:33:46.072 --> 00:33:51.112
interesting because there is a
whole rainbow there.

00:33:51.112 --> 00:33:57.262
I am going to turn the lamp a
little bit since not all of you,

00:33:57.262 --> 00:34:02.000
if you are way on the side,
can see it.

00:34:02.000 --> 00:34:07.299
I am going to start over here
and I am going to turn the lamp

00:34:07.299 --> 00:34:09.684
a bit.
Can you see that now?

00:34:09.684 --> 00:34:14.984
You should see a bunch of lines
here to your left and some to

00:34:14.984 --> 00:34:17.722
your right.
And then, of course,

00:34:17.722 --> 00:34:21.962
you will see some up here.
But they will probably

00:34:21.962 --> 00:34:25.936
dispersed best to your left and
to your right.

00:34:25.936 --> 00:34:30.000
Pardon?
Can we dim the bay lights?

00:34:30.000 --> 00:34:35.428
Can we dim those big lights
over there?

00:34:35.428 --> 00:34:41.000
Probably not.
I am going to turn it over

00:34:41.000 --> 00:34:43.857
here.
Can you see it?

00:34:43.857 --> 00:34:52.285
The spectrum that you should
see is what I am showing on the

00:34:52.285 --> 00:34:56.571
center board there.
You see it?

00:34:56.571 --> 00:35:02.559
Pardon?
You have to look at the light.

00:35:02.559 --> 00:35:06.593
Oh, thank you.
Thank you very much.

00:35:06.593 --> 00:35:13.000
Can you see that better?
I will turn it back there.

00:35:23.000 --> 00:35:27.271
Do you see the emission
spectrum now?

00:35:27.271 --> 00:35:30.000
It's a little better.

00:35:43.000 --> 00:35:49.250
Let's see if we can try to
understand this emission

00:35:49.250 --> 00:35:55.625
spectrum that you're seeing.
What you should see the

00:35:55.625 --> 00:36:00.000
brightest is a purple line.
No?

00:36:00.000 --> 00:36:05.397
Well, let's see.
The purple line is actually

00:36:05.397 --> 00:36:12.301
rather weak, I have to say.
If you come really close you

00:36:12.301 --> 00:36:17.573
can see it.
And you're invited to come up a

00:36:17.573 --> 00:36:23.096
little bit closer.
The purple line is kind of

00:36:23.096 --> 00:36:25.481
weak.
What did I do?

00:36:25.481 --> 00:36:27.991
[LAUGHTER] Oh,
I see.

00:36:27.991 --> 00:36:32.616
Yes.
Interference phenomena work.

00:36:32.616 --> 00:36:36.261
Hey, look at that.
[LAUGHTER] Fantastic.

00:36:36.261 --> 00:36:39.626
All right.
The purple line is kind of

00:36:39.626 --> 00:36:43.364
weak, but the blue line is
really strong.

00:36:43.364 --> 00:36:48.691
And then there is a green line,
which is also a little bit

00:36:48.691 --> 00:36:51.495
weak.
And I can see because I'm

00:36:51.495 --> 00:36:55.607
really close,
well, I'm not going to tell you

00:36:55.607 --> 00:37:00.000
that.
There is a green line there.

00:37:00.000 --> 00:37:02.711
And then there is this red
line.

00:37:02.711 --> 00:37:07.784
Let's see if we can understand
where these lines are coming

00:37:07.784 --> 00:37:10.845
from.
What is happening is that this

00:37:10.845 --> 00:37:15.655
discharge, not only does it pull
the H two apart,

00:37:15.655 --> 00:37:18.454
break bonds,
make hydrogen atoms,

00:37:18.454 --> 00:37:22.827
but it puts some of those
hydrogen atoms into these

00:37:22.827 --> 00:37:26.851
excited states.
And so a hydrogen atom might be

00:37:26.851 --> 00:37:32.151
in this excited state.
This initial excited state,

00:37:32.151 --> 00:37:34.781
high energy state.
And, of course,

00:37:34.781 --> 00:37:38.128
that's a high energy state.
It is unstable.

00:37:38.128 --> 00:37:42.431
The system wants to relax.
It wants to relax to a lower

00:37:42.431 --> 00:37:45.061
energy state.
And when it does so,

00:37:45.061 --> 00:37:48.249
because it's going to lower
energy state,

00:37:48.249 --> 00:37:52.632
it has to emit radiation.
And that radiation is going to

00:37:52.632 --> 00:37:56.935
come out as a photon whose
energy is exactly the energy

00:37:56.935 --> 00:38:01.000
difference between these two
states.

00:38:01.000 --> 00:38:05.109
That's the quantum nature,
here, of the hydrogen atom.

00:38:05.109 --> 00:38:08.754
The photon that comes out has
to have an energy,

00:38:08.754 --> 00:38:13.096
delta E, which is exactly the
energy of the initial state

00:38:13.096 --> 00:38:16.585
minus that of the final state.
And, therefore,

00:38:16.585 --> 00:38:21.470
the frequency of that radiation
is going to have one value given

00:38:21.470 --> 00:38:25.812
by this energy difference
divided by Planck's constant h.

00:38:25.812 --> 00:38:30.000
That is what's happening in the
discharge.

00:38:30.000 --> 00:38:34.009
What we've got is some hydrogen
atoms excited to say,

00:38:34.009 --> 00:38:35.937
for example,
this B state,

00:38:35.937 --> 00:38:40.641
which is a lower energy state,
and so when it relaxes there is

00:38:40.641 --> 00:38:44.728
a small energy difference
between here and this bottom

00:38:44.728 --> 00:38:47.273
state.
Therefore, you are going to

00:38:47.273 --> 00:38:49.818
have a low frequency of
radiation.

00:38:49.818 --> 00:38:54.599
If you have some other hydrogen
atoms in the discharge that are

00:38:54.599 --> 00:38:58.917
excited to this state up here,
well, this is a big energy

00:38:58.917 --> 00:39:02.915
difference.
And so delta E is going to be

00:39:02.915 --> 00:39:04.301
large.
And, therefore,

00:39:04.301 --> 00:39:07.867
you're going to have some
radiation emitted that's at a

00:39:07.867 --> 00:39:10.443
high frequency because delta E
is large.

00:39:10.443 --> 00:39:14.009
If it's at a high frequency,
it's going to have a short

00:39:14.009 --> 00:39:16.716
wavelength.
These hydrogen atoms are going

00:39:16.716 --> 00:39:18.830
to have a low frequency
emission.

00:39:18.830 --> 00:39:21.075
It's going to be a long
wavelength.

00:39:21.075 --> 00:39:24.773
So, we've got a mixture of
atoms in this state or in this

00:39:24.773 --> 00:39:29.000
state or in any other states in
this discharge.

00:39:29.000 --> 00:39:32.549
Now, let's try to understand
this spectrum.

00:39:32.549 --> 00:39:37.450
And to do that I have drawn an
energy level diagram for the

00:39:37.450 --> 00:39:40.746
hydrogen atom.
Here is n equals 1 state,

00:39:40.746 --> 00:39:45.309
n equals 2, n equals 3,
n equals 4, all the way up to n

00:39:45.309 --> 00:39:49.619
equals 0 here on the top.
They get closer and closer

00:39:49.619 --> 00:39:52.830
together as we go up.
This purple line,

00:39:52.830 --> 00:39:56.464
it turns out,
or the purple color comes from

00:39:56.464 --> 00:40:01.112
a transition made from a
hydrogen atom in the n equals 6

00:40:01.112 --> 00:40:07.022
state to the n equals 2 state.
The final n here is 2.

00:40:07.022 --> 00:40:12.077
The blue line comes from a
hydrogen atom that has made a

00:40:12.077 --> 00:40:16.213
transition from n equals 5 also
to n equals 2.

00:40:16.213 --> 00:40:20.808
The green line is from a
hydrogen atom that makes a

00:40:20.808 --> 00:40:26.415
transition from n equals 4 to n
equals 2 and then the red line

00:40:26.415 --> 00:40:32.576
from n equals 3 to n equals 2.
Of course, the transition from

00:40:32.576 --> 00:40:36.613
n equals 3 to n equals 2 is the
smallest energy.

00:40:36.613 --> 00:40:40.993
Therefore, it is going to be
the longest wavelength.

00:40:40.993 --> 00:40:44.343
n equals 6 to n equals 2
largest energy.

00:40:44.343 --> 00:40:48.981
Therefore, it is going to have
the smallest wavelength.

00:40:48.981 --> 00:40:53.877
Now, how do we know that these
frequencies agree with what

00:40:53.877 --> 00:40:58.000
Schrödinger predicted they
should be?

00:40:58.000 --> 00:41:01.434
Well, to know that,
what we're going to do is we're

00:41:01.434 --> 00:41:04.044
going to write down this
equation here,

00:41:04.044 --> 00:41:08.096
which is just telling us what
the frequency of the radiation

00:41:08.096 --> 00:41:12.080
should be, it is delta E over H.
But we're going to use the

00:41:12.080 --> 00:41:16.476
predictions from the Schrödinger
equation and plug them into here

00:41:16.476 --> 00:41:19.292
to calculate what the frequency
should be.

00:41:19.292 --> 00:41:22.933
We were told here that the
energy, say, of the initial

00:41:22.933 --> 00:41:27.054
state given by the Schrödinger
equation is minus R sub H over

00:41:27.054 --> 00:41:29.389
the initial quantum number
squared.

00:41:29.389 --> 00:41:34.009
We're going to plug that into

00:41:34.009 --> 00:41:35.534
there.
The final state,

00:41:35.534 --> 00:41:38.792
well, that's also the
expression for the energy,

00:41:38.792 --> 00:41:41.217
we're going to plug that into
there.

00:41:41.217 --> 00:41:44.198
We're then going to rearrange
that equation,

00:41:44.198 --> 00:41:48.287
so we get the frequency is the
Rydberg constant over H times

00:41:48.287 --> 00:41:52.237
this quantity (1 over n sub f
squared minus 1 over n sub i

00:41:52.237 --> 00:41:54.524
squared).

00:41:54.524 --> 00:42:00.000
And since I told you
here that all of these lines --

00:42:00.000 --> 00:42:04.090
The final quantum number is 2.
We can plug that in.

00:42:04.090 --> 00:42:07.772
And then we can just go in and
put in 3, 4, 5,

00:42:07.772 --> 00:42:12.190
6 and get predictions for what
nu is for the frequency.

00:42:12.190 --> 00:42:17.018
And what you would find is that
predictions that this makes,

00:42:17.018 --> 00:42:22.009
the Schrödinger equation makes
agrees with the observations of

00:42:22.009 --> 00:42:27.000
the frequencies of these lines
to one part in 10^8.

00:42:27.000 --> 00:42:32.638
There is really just remarkable
agreement between the energies

00:42:32.638 --> 00:42:38.369
or the frequencies predicted by
Schršdinger's equation and what

00:42:38.369 --> 00:42:41.974
we actual observe for the
hydrogen atom.

00:42:41.974 --> 00:42:47.613
Here is another diagram of the
energies of the hydrogen atom n

00:42:47.613 --> 00:42:50.571
equals 1, n equals 2,
n equals 3.

00:42:50.571 --> 00:42:56.025
And the four lines that we were
looking at where shown right

00:42:56.025 --> 00:43:00.000
here.
These are the four lines.

00:43:00.000 --> 00:43:04.980
Here is n equals 6 to n equals
2, n equals 5 to n equals 2.

00:43:04.980 --> 00:43:09.188
These lines are actually called
the Balmer series.

00:43:09.188 --> 00:43:13.997
I want you to know that there
is also a transition from n

00:43:13.997 --> 00:43:17.346
equals 6 to n equals 1.
It is over here.

00:43:17.346 --> 00:43:22.240
But you can see that that
transition is a very high energy

00:43:22.240 --> 00:43:25.675
transition.
That transition occurs in the

00:43:25.675 --> 00:43:31.000
ultraviolet range of the
electromagnetic spectrum.

00:43:31.000 --> 00:43:33.433
And, therefore,
you cannot see it,

00:43:33.433 --> 00:43:36.751
but it is there.
Actually, what you can see is

00:43:36.751 --> 00:43:41.175
that there are transitions from
these higher energy states to

00:43:41.175 --> 00:43:44.714
the ground state,
transitions from all of them to

00:43:44.714 --> 00:43:47.589
the ground state,
but they're all in the

00:43:47.589 --> 00:43:51.202
ultraviolet range of the
electromagnetic spectrum.

00:43:51.202 --> 00:43:54.225
That is why you cannot see that
right now.

00:43:54.225 --> 00:43:57.396
But those lines are called the
Lyman series.

00:43:57.396 --> 00:44:03.000
And then there are transitions
here to the n equals 3 state.

00:44:03.000 --> 00:44:07.863
These transitions from the
larger quantum number to n

00:44:07.863 --> 00:44:11.417
equals 3 are called the Paschen
series.

00:44:11.417 --> 00:44:14.316
They occur in the near
infrared.

00:44:14.316 --> 00:44:17.215
Brackett series in the
infrared.

00:44:17.215 --> 00:44:20.208
Pfund series in the far
infrared.

00:44:20.208 --> 00:44:24.978
I got that backwards.
And these different series are

00:44:24.978 --> 00:44:30.990
all labeled by the final state.
And they're labeled by the

00:44:30.990 --> 00:44:34.970
names of the discoverers.
And the reason there are so

00:44:34.970 --> 00:44:39.256
many different discoverers is
because in order to see the

00:44:39.256 --> 00:44:43.619
different kinds of radiation,
you have to have a different

00:44:43.619 --> 00:44:47.217
kind of detector.
And, depending on what kind of

00:44:47.217 --> 00:44:51.580
a detector an experimentalist
had, well, that will dictate

00:44:51.580 --> 00:44:55.637
then what he actually can see,
what kind of radiation,

00:44:55.637 --> 00:45:00.000
which ones of these transitions
he can view.

00:45:00.000 --> 00:45:04.858
Now, we looked at emission.
But it is also possible for

00:45:04.858 --> 00:45:09.807
there to be absorption between
these allowed states of a

00:45:09.807 --> 00:45:13.856
hydrogen atom.
That is, we can have a hydrogen

00:45:13.856 --> 00:45:18.984
atom here in a low energy state,
the initial state E sub i.

00:45:18.984 --> 00:45:22.403
And if there is a photon around

00:45:22.403 --> 00:45:27.712
whose energy matches the energy
difference between these two

00:45:27.712 --> 00:45:31.041
states, well,
then, that photon can be

00:45:31.041 --> 00:45:36.832
absorbed by the hydrogen atom.
Again, the energy of that

00:45:36.832 --> 00:45:40.938
photon has to be exactly the
difference in energy between

00:45:40.938 --> 00:45:44.310
those two states.
It cannot be a little larger.

00:45:44.310 --> 00:45:48.343
If it is a little larger,
that photon is not going to be

00:45:48.343 --> 00:45:50.249
absorbed.
That's important.

00:45:50.249 --> 00:45:54.208
That's the quantum nature,
again, of the hydrogen atom.

00:45:54.208 --> 00:45:58.460
There are specific energies
that are allowed and nothing in

00:45:58.460 --> 00:46:02.071
between.
And then, from knowing the

00:46:02.071 --> 00:46:05.895
energy of the photon,
you can get that frequency.

00:46:05.895 --> 00:46:10.118
And then in the case of
absorption, the frequencies of

00:46:10.118 --> 00:46:14.579
the radiation that can be
absorbed by a hydrogen atom are

00:46:14.579 --> 00:46:18.802
given by this expression.
This expression differs from

00:46:18.802 --> 00:46:23.582
the frequencies for emission
only in that I've reversed these

00:46:23.582 --> 00:46:26.769
two terms.
This is 1 over n sub i squared.

00:46:26.769 --> 00:46:31.943
This is 1 over n sub f squared.

00:46:31.943 --> 00:46:36.161
I have reversed them so that

00:46:36.161 --> 00:46:41.556
you come out with a frequency
that is a positive number.

00:46:41.556 --> 00:46:44.892
Frequencies do have to be
positive.

00:46:44.892 --> 00:46:49.895
So, we've got two different
expressions here for the

00:46:49.895 --> 00:46:55.487
frequency depending on whether
we're absorbing a photon or

00:46:55.487 --> 00:47:00.000
we're emitting a photon.
Questions?

00:47:00.000 --> 00:47:02.656
I cannot see anybody.
There.

00:47:02.656 --> 00:47:08.657
Epsilon nought is a conversion
factor for electrostatic units.

00:47:08.657 --> 00:47:12.002
That is all you need at the
moment.

00:47:12.002 --> 00:47:17.315
In 8.02 maybe you will go
through the unit conversation

00:47:17.315 --> 00:47:19.248
there to get you to SI units.
