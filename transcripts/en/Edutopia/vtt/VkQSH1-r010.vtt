00:00:01.553 --> 00:00:02.386
(metal clicks)

00:00:02.386 --> 00:00:03.430
- [Student] That one won't go.

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:06.710
- When we turn on the
hoverboard, what's gonna happen?

00:00:06.710 --> 00:00:09.240
- [Student] It's gonna hit.

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:10.930
- Because our students participate in

00:00:10.930 --> 00:00:13.370
meaningful projects, they are able to

00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:15.440
think outside of the box.

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:18.790
They learn empathy and
realize that their dreams

00:00:18.790 --> 00:00:20.922
may become a reality.

00:00:20.922 --> 00:00:22.010
(clapping)

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:23.530
- Are you excited?

00:00:23.530 --> 00:00:24.363
- Yeah!

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:35.510
- Part of the fabric of Eminence culture

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:38.520
is contributing to the larger society.

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:40.970
So we really try to encourage kids

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:42.730
to plug into what is a problem,

00:00:42.730 --> 00:00:44.928
or an issue, or a gap
that needs to be filled,

00:00:44.928 --> 00:00:48.261
and then how can you contribute to that?

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:53.800
So Wheels for Tate really
starts with this idea

00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:57.240
that there is a kid in our
building who has a need,

00:00:57.240 --> 00:01:00.180
and we feel like we can
take a shot at solving that.

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:02.360
- The fifth grade classroom
is at the other end

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:03.300
of our building.

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:05.840
Tate can't walk that really,
really, long distance,

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:08.330
so my Special Ed. Director
said, "Hey, wouldn't it

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:11.920
be cool if we could design
a hoverboard chair?"

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:14.090
We had about 27 kids sign up.

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:16.030
We'll talk about our parts and pieces,

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:19.440
and what we need to do
today to get it started.

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:20.810
- I said, "Well, how
are you gonna do that?

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:23.570
You know, a mobilized
wheelchair might be $15,000."

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:25.470
They started scouring the internet,

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:28.710
and they came back and said,
"We're gonna do it for $400."

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:32.300
- We had this picture and
a video it was based on.

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:33.133
- [Kelli] The kids came up with

00:01:33.133 --> 00:01:34.730
the idea to sell advertisements

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:36.950
to go on back of the
hoverboard wheelchair.

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:39.180
So when you see any of those businesses,

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:41.160
make sure that you give
them a big thank you.

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:43.870
Tate, can you tell us how
does this make you Feel?

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:45.990
- Happy.

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:48.710
- After we had the funding
in place, the next step

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:50.850
was to actually design the vehicle.

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:53.900
We had to take Tate's
measurements to figure out

00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:55.688
the dimensions for the frame.

00:01:55.688 --> 00:01:58.870
We wanted to make sure
that we could make it safe.

00:01:58.870 --> 00:02:00.608
Why did we chose to go with aluminum?

00:02:00.608 --> 00:02:03.780
- It's light and very strong.

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:05.440
- [Kelli] This morning the students worked

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:07.390
on putting the vehicle together.

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:10.135
So they had to file the aluminum,

00:02:10.135 --> 00:02:13.453
create the frame, attach all the pieces.

00:02:13.453 --> 00:02:15.250
- It's really cool.

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:16.660
I've never done this before.

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:19.185
It's really helping me with math.

00:02:19.185 --> 00:02:21.890
- [Student] Just measure
the actuals to make sure

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:25.660
it's centered and the bolts are on tight.

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:28.265
- [Bridget] We had to put
the wheels on the axle

00:02:28.265 --> 00:02:30.560
and the chair on top of it.

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:33.020
We also had to think about the hoverboard

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:34.476
and it's placement.

00:02:34.476 --> 00:02:37.090
- [Kelli] Guys, I see a
problem with that hoverboard.

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:38.690
I'm gonna wait and see if you guys can

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:40.476
problem solve and figure it out yourself.

00:02:40.476 --> 00:02:41.309
- [Student] It's backwards.

00:02:41.309 --> 00:02:42.142
- [Kelli] It's backwards.

00:02:42.142 --> 00:02:43.690
- [Student] It's backwards?!

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:46.360
- And I tightened that thing really hard.

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:49.030
- [Kelli] We ran into a lot
of problems, but once they

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:50.130
figured it out on their own,

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:52.546
they have so much more
pride in their work.

00:02:52.546 --> 00:02:54.546
- Once the plastic zip ties are secure,

00:02:54.546 --> 00:02:56.680
the chair should be secure.

00:02:56.680 --> 00:02:57.990
It's secure.

00:02:57.990 --> 00:03:00.400
- So, moving forward, we need
to make sure it works, right?

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:02.190
So we're gonna test drive.

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:04.640
- [Kelli] Let's explain
to Tate, a refresher on

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:05.930
what he needs to do.

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:07.940
- [Student] He needs
to put equal weight on

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:09.805
both feet and lean forward.

00:03:09.805 --> 00:03:11.270
- [Kelli] There you go.

00:03:11.270 --> 00:03:13.285
Tate was so excited to hop on to

00:03:13.285 --> 00:03:15.050
the hoverboard wheel chair.

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:16.540
He was able to sit down,

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:18.100
and he was able to get his feet aligned.

00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:19.429
- [Group] Here we go!

00:03:19.429 --> 00:03:20.420
(claps)

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:21.330
- [Student] Good job, Tate.

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:23.200
- [Student] So we're
trying to get handlebars

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:25.663
so Tate can steer.

00:03:25.663 --> 00:03:26.496
- [Kelli] Those handlebars are going to be

00:03:26.496 --> 00:03:28.170
so helpful for you.

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:29.477
- Yeah!

00:03:29.477 --> 00:03:30.669
- [Kelli] You did good!

00:03:30.669 --> 00:03:31.928
- [Student] Good job, Tate!

00:03:31.928 --> 00:03:33.470
(claps)

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:36.429
- This project taught them
more than I ever could

00:03:36.429 --> 00:03:38.549
in a 30 minute lecture.

00:03:38.549 --> 00:03:41.000
It allows the hands on experience.

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:45.230
Also, building empathy
was a really key piece.

00:03:45.230 --> 00:03:47.300
- Once you've made a
difference for another

00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:49.690
human being, it's really
hard to stop that.

00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:54.250
When I see the kid who I
built a mobility device for,

00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:56.724
and his eyes light up,
and I've made his day

00:03:56.724 --> 00:03:59.690
that gets in you and you
want to do more of that.

00:03:59.690 --> 00:04:02.010
- It makes me feel good inside,

00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:04.010
because I'm doing something good,

00:04:04.010 --> 00:04:06.880
and no one gets left out.
