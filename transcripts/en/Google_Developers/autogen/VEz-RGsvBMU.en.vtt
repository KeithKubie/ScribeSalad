00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:35.590 align:start position:0%
of their friends so a four player mesh
 

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:37.229 align:start position:0%
of their friends so a four player mesh
network<00:03:35.980><c> okay</c><00:03:36.250><c> and</c><00:03:36.400><c> then</c><00:03:36.579><c> it's</c><00:03:36.819><c> real</c><00:03:37.000><c> time</c>

00:03:37.229 --> 00:03:37.239 align:start position:0%
