&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington, D.C.

00:00:19.940 --> 00:00:23.330
&gt;&gt; Juan Manuel Perez: The
topic of today is a topic

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:26.800
that has been largely forgotten.

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:32.190
When we think of Spaniards in the
U.S., the first thing that comes

00:00:32.190 --> 00:00:38.600
to mind are the Conquerors and
the explorers of the 16th century,

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:44.340 position:56%
17th century and even 18th century,
but contemporary Spanish immigration

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:47.490
to the U.S. has been
largely forgotten.

00:00:47.490 --> 00:00:54.660
And, except maybe for the work by
Herman Breda [phonetic] in 1992,

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:57.970
published by the Murphy Foundation.

00:00:57.970 --> 00:01:03.630
It is a subject that is,
you know, basically unknown.

00:01:03.630 --> 00:01:09.030
That's why, when I was
contacted this spring and told

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:13.470
about the research that our
speaker today has been doing

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:20.740
for the last 7 years, I got
real excited because, obviously,

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:24.700
immigration is, for obvious
reasons, is of interest

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:26.830
to me since I am an immigrant.

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:30.250
I was born and raised in Spain.

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:36.020
Professor Fernandez is
professor of Spanish History

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:38.890
and Literature at New
York University.

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:47.580
He received his BA from Dartmouth
College in 1983 and his MA and PhD

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:54.090
in Romance Languages in Literature
from Princeton University in 1988.

00:01:54.090 --> 00:02:01.950
He taught at Yale University
from 1988 to 1995 before moving

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:06.050
to New York University where
he has been ever since.

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:11.970
At NYU, he served for 12 years
as the Inaugural Director

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:16.790
of University's King Juan
Carlos Center of Spain.

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:19.850
He is author or editor
of several books

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:23.320
on Spanish literature,
history and culture.

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:26.090
And, for the last 7
years, he has been working

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:30.170
on a major project aimed
at documenting the history

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:35.140
of Spanish immigration to the
United States in the late 19th

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:37.400
and early 20th centuries.

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:43.090
Together with Luis Argeo in
2014, he coauthored the book

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:49.600
that he will talk to us about
today, "Invisible Immigrants:

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:54.510
Spaniards in the U.S. 1868-1945".

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:56.310
Professor.

[ Applause ]

00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:03.530
&gt;&gt; James D. Fernandez: Thank
you so much, Juan Manuel.

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:08.100 position:56%
I'd like to express, or repeat, the
expressions of gratitude to everyone

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:12.960
who has made this event possible,
the Library of Congress, Mariel,

00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:16.060
Catalina and Juan Manuel Perez.

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:19.660
I'd also like to acknowledge the
support of the Consul General

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:21.630
of Spain in Washington
who's not here yet.

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:23.680
I think he might be on his way,

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:28.480
but Enrique Sarda Valls has been
very supportive of this project

00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:30.020
and I'd like to recognize that.

00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:33.380
And, also, thank Maria
Molina Alvarez de Toledo,

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:35.840
recently appointed cultural head

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:39.010
of the Embassy's cultural
office, for joining us today.

00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:40.310
Thank you so much.

00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:47.700
Many of you have been supporting
this project over the years.

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:50.310
And, actually, I've had
the incredible privilege

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:53.730
of just meeting, today
here, some people that,

00:03:53.730 --> 00:03:57.920
over the last few years, have been
sending photographs and information

00:03:57.920 --> 00:04:02.430
and even money [laughter] to
support, to support this project.

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:05.890
And it really is, it's a
pleasure and an honor to be here.

00:04:05.890 --> 00:04:07.910
It's kind of daunting to be
in the Library of Congress

00:04:07.910 --> 00:04:12.010
and it's daunting, also, to
start meeting old friends,

00:04:12.010 --> 00:04:14.360
or seeing old friends
and meeting new friends,

00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:18.950
some of which have been Facebook
friends for several years.

00:04:18.950 --> 00:04:20.990
So, thank you all,
really, for being here

00:04:20.990 --> 00:04:24.380
and for your support
of this project.

00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:27.500
I'm going to begin
by invoking a speech

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:31.250
that might seem very
familiar to many of you.

00:04:31.250 --> 00:04:35.530
In the midst of a profound
economic and social crisis,

00:04:35.530 --> 00:04:38.790
an aspiring politician
attacks the immigrants

00:04:38.790 --> 00:04:44.250
of a certain nation portraying
that nation as a lawless mess

00:04:44.250 --> 00:04:46.020
and accusing that nation's
government

00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:49.310
of intentionally sending its
most undesirable citizens

00:04:49.310 --> 00:04:52.020
to the United States.

00:04:52.020 --> 00:04:53.320
Sound familiar?

00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:57.330
[Laughter] They are not
sending us their best.

00:04:59.090 --> 00:05:01.390
But the speech that I'm
thinking of might sound familiar,

00:05:01.390 --> 00:05:06.100
but I don't think any of you
have ever heard it before.

00:05:06.100 --> 00:05:09.790 position:56%
Because the discourse that I'm
referencing was delivered just a few

00:05:09.790 --> 00:05:16.500
steps from here, was delivered just
a few steps from here on the Floor

00:05:16.500 --> 00:05:19.860
of the House of Representatives
in 1920.

00:05:19.860 --> 00:05:24.770
The speaker was Congressman Harold
Knutson, Republican of Minnesota,

00:05:24.770 --> 00:05:27.370
and his exact words were these.

00:05:27.370 --> 00:05:31.490
Spain is a seething mess of anarchy

00:05:31.490 --> 00:05:34.640
and the Spanish government
is gathering these anarchists

00:05:34.640 --> 00:05:39.060
and dumping them on
us, 1920 on the Floor

00:05:39.060 --> 00:05:41.110
of the House of Representatives.

00:05:41.110 --> 00:05:47.360 position:56%
In the speech, this Norwegian born
Congressman Knutson [laughter] talks

00:05:47.360 --> 00:05:51.340
about having recently visited
Ellis Island where he claims

00:05:51.340 --> 00:05:56.680
to have witnessed the arrival on
a single day of 2,000 Spaniards.

00:05:56.680 --> 00:06:00.940
It is in the face of this perceived
invasion that Knutson and many

00:06:00.940 --> 00:06:03.090
of his colleagues,
anti-immigrant colleagues,

00:06:03.090 --> 00:06:07.630
proposed the construction, not of
a physical wall, but of a legal,

00:06:07.630 --> 00:06:10.770
statistical obstacle, a funnel.

00:06:10.770 --> 00:06:13.650
And, within a few years, the
United States would enact a series

00:06:13.650 --> 00:06:18.910
of very strict national quotas
limiting the immigration of many,

00:06:18.910 --> 00:06:23.670
especially Asians, but also
Southern and Eastern Europeans.

00:06:23.670 --> 00:06:27.980
So, by 1924, the annual
quota for Spaniards

00:06:27.980 --> 00:06:33.260
who could legally enter
the United States was 131

00:06:33.260 --> 00:06:36.300
from the whole country,
for the whole year.

00:06:37.890 --> 00:06:43.960
See if I can talk and
chew gum at the same time.

00:06:43.960 --> 00:06:49.650 position:56%
I cite this example of -- unpleasant
example of Hispanophobia directed,

00:06:49.650 --> 00:06:55.450 position:56%
in this case, against, specifically
against Spaniards from 100 years ago

00:06:55.450 --> 00:06:58.350
because I think it will surprise
many of you that citizens

00:06:58.350 --> 00:07:02.760
of Spain were generating such
anxiety among anti-immigrant folks

00:07:02.760 --> 00:07:06.520
like the good Congressman from
Minnesota, or not so good.

00:07:06.520 --> 00:07:09.820
It tends to surprise because
very few people know that,

00:07:09.820 --> 00:07:14.160
in the last decades of the 19th and
early decades of the 20th century,

00:07:14.160 --> 00:07:17.430
tens of thousands of
Spaniards ended up settling

00:07:17.430 --> 00:07:21.390
in tightly knit enclaves all over
the United States from Tampa,

00:07:21.390 --> 00:07:24.450
Florida to Boise, Idaho,
from Sacramento,

00:07:24.450 --> 00:07:27.860
California to Barre, Vermont.

00:07:27.860 --> 00:07:32.000 position:56%
As Juan Manuel said, I've made these
invisible immigrants the subject

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:35.770
of my research for the last 7
or 8 years, and I'd like, today,

00:07:35.770 --> 00:07:44.790
to briefly present some of
the findings of this work.

00:07:44.790 --> 00:07:48.820 position:56%
Spaniards in the Americas, Juan
Manuel also alluded to this already,

00:07:48.820 --> 00:07:51.840
for many people in the U.S. and
probably for many people in Spain

00:07:51.840 --> 00:07:55.160
as well, this phrase,
Spaniards in the Americas,

00:07:55.160 --> 00:08:00.200
almost certainly will evoke images
of the Conquistadores, explorers

00:08:00.200 --> 00:08:04.220
and friars who, in the name of the
Spanish crown, mapped, explored,

00:08:04.220 --> 00:08:08.520
conquered and settled vast swaths
of the Americas, south, central

00:08:08.520 --> 00:08:12.460
and north during the 16th, 17th
and 18th centuries, including,

00:08:12.460 --> 00:08:16.060
of course, very large portions
of the territory that, today,

00:08:16.060 --> 00:08:19.050
forms part of the United States.

00:08:19.050 --> 00:08:22.670
Very few people realize, however,
that the number of Spaniards

00:08:22.670 --> 00:08:26.080
who left the Iberian Peninsula
to come to the Americas

00:08:26.080 --> 00:08:29.280
in the latter half of the 19th
century and the first decades

00:08:29.280 --> 00:08:34.460
of the 20, is vastly greater than
the number of all of the Spaniards

00:08:34.460 --> 00:08:37.920
who made that same trip in
the previous 4 centuries.

00:08:37.920 --> 00:08:39.220
Now think about that.

00:08:39.220 --> 00:08:42.250
You can add up -- if we add up the
Spaniards who came to the Americas

00:08:42.250 --> 00:08:48.880
between 1850 and 1930, the estimate
made by historians is 4 million.

00:08:48.880 --> 00:08:52.970
Four million Spaniards in that 80
year period came to the Americas,

00:08:52.970 --> 00:08:56.270
whereas, between Columbus's
first voyage in 1850,

00:08:56.270 --> 00:08:58.230
we're talking about
a different scale,

00:08:58.230 --> 00:09:00.780
hundreds of thousands,
and not millions.

00:09:00.780 --> 00:09:06.950
So the implications of this are
that the massive demographic,

00:09:06.950 --> 00:09:12.510
cultural presence of Spaniards
in the Americas is really a 19th

00:09:12.510 --> 00:09:15.180
and 20th century phenomenon.

00:09:15.180 --> 00:09:19.120 position:56%
And, when we start thinking this
way, pretty much everything changes.

00:09:20.170 --> 00:09:24.280
Here's Consul General Enrique,
thank you so much for joining us.

00:09:24.280 --> 00:09:25.580
&gt;&gt; Enrique Sarda Valls:
Sorry to be late.

00:09:25.580 --> 00:09:26.880
&gt;&gt; James D. Fernandez:
No, I hope you'll -- .

00:09:26.880 --> 00:09:28.690 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Enrique Sarda Valls: -- I'm sorry
to be late, ladies and gentlemen,

00:09:28.690 --> 00:09:32.250
but I wasn't, I couldn't find
the right building [laughter].

00:09:33.310 --> 00:09:37.470
So I prayed, I apologize.

00:09:37.470 --> 00:09:38.770
&gt;&gt; James D. Fernandez:
Thank you so much.

00:09:38.770 --> 00:09:40.070
&gt;&gt; Enrique Sarda Valls: Go on.

00:09:40.070 --> 00:09:43.160
&gt;&gt; James D. Fernandez: Thank you.

00:09:43.160 --> 00:09:47.570
Yeah, so the implications of this
statistic, right, are that --

00:09:47.570 --> 00:09:50.300
and it should, I think it
should change the way we think

00:09:50.300 --> 00:09:52.060
about the history of Spain,

00:09:52.060 --> 00:09:55.570
the history of Spain's
presence in the Americas.

00:09:55.570 --> 00:10:00.390
The massive presence of Spaniards
on these continents is a modern,

00:10:00.390 --> 00:10:02.420
almost contemporary phenomenon.

00:10:02.420 --> 00:10:07.330
And it occurs mainly after
Spain has lost sovereignty

00:10:07.330 --> 00:10:09.930
over most of the Americas.

00:10:09.930 --> 00:10:13.390
Those millions of Spaniards are
traveling, for the most part,

00:10:13.390 --> 00:10:16.490
to countries that have achieved
their independence from Spain

00:10:16.490 --> 00:10:18.640
with the exception, of
course, of Cuba and Puerto Rico

00:10:18.640 --> 00:10:22.540
which also continue to receive
massive number of immigrants

00:10:22.540 --> 00:10:24.720
through the late 19th century.

00:10:24.720 --> 00:10:27.340
But a lot of people don't
know that immigration to Cuba

00:10:27.340 --> 00:10:32.960
from Spain actually accelerated
and intensified after 1898, okay.

00:10:32.960 --> 00:10:36.840
It seems like a paradox, but we can
talk about that, and it's actually,

00:10:36.840 --> 00:10:38.560
it can be explained, okay?

00:10:38.560 --> 00:10:43.030
It's in the context of the
waning of the Spanish Empire

00:10:43.030 --> 00:10:46.450
in the American Hemisphere and
the emergence of the United States

00:10:46.450 --> 00:10:49.990
as an interventionist
imperialist world power

00:10:49.990 --> 00:10:52.910
in this late 19th,
early 20th century.

00:10:52.910 --> 00:10:57.040 position:56%
And, especially here in what came to
be called the American Hemisphere,

00:10:57.040 --> 00:11:00.060
it's that context, it's
within that context

00:11:00.060 --> 00:11:03.340
that roughly 4 million
Spaniards came to the Americas.

00:11:03.340 --> 00:11:06.730
And, of course as we know, the vast
majority of those Spaniards went

00:11:06.730 --> 00:11:09.230
to Spanish speaking
countries for obvious reasons,

00:11:09.230 --> 00:11:12.550
cultural, linguistic affinity.

00:11:12.550 --> 00:11:17.010
But a significant number of them
ended up in the United States.

00:11:18.210 --> 00:11:21.230
Did that work?

00:11:21.230 --> 00:11:23.440
[ Inaudible Comment ]

00:11:23.440 --> 00:11:26.090 position:56%
Okay, it's the same picture I think.

00:11:26.090 --> 00:11:30.170
So, for several years, I've been
working with Luis Argeo, a writer

00:11:30.170 --> 00:11:32.510
and filmmaker from Asturias.

00:11:32.510 --> 00:11:34.310
We have been crisscrossing the U.S.

00:11:34.310 --> 00:11:37.020
and Spain interviewing
the descendants

00:11:37.020 --> 00:11:40.500
of these intrepid immigrants,
filming their oral histories and,

00:11:40.500 --> 00:11:43.300
whenever possible, scanning
their family albums.

00:11:43.300 --> 00:11:46.230
Our long term goal
is to create a vast,

00:11:46.230 --> 00:11:50.740
digital online archive available
to anyone, historians or families,

00:11:50.740 --> 00:11:54.490
or anyone interested in this little
known chapter of the shared history

00:11:54.490 --> 00:11:59.040
of Spain and the U.S. Along the
way, as we build this archive,

00:11:59.040 --> 00:12:03.380
we're producing documentary
films, we've completed 2,

00:12:03.380 --> 00:12:08.020
online exhibitions and physical
exhibitions and, also, books.

00:12:08.020 --> 00:12:09.830
The first book is the
one I'd like to talk

00:12:09.830 --> 00:12:12.400 position:56%
about today, "Invisible Immigrants".

00:12:12.400 --> 00:12:16.410
It was just over a year ago
that we realized, Luis and I,

00:12:16.410 --> 00:12:19.190
that we had already
amassed an archive of more

00:12:19.190 --> 00:12:21.760
than 7,000 photographs, most

00:12:21.760 --> 00:12:24.400
of them never seen beyond
the immediate context

00:12:24.400 --> 00:12:26.580
of the family that owned them.

00:12:26.580 --> 00:12:30.810
And we realized that those
photos are an invaluable resource

00:12:30.810 --> 00:12:33.220
for the reconstruction
of this history,

00:12:33.220 --> 00:12:37.280
and decided that the time had come
to try to tell the general story

00:12:37.280 --> 00:12:39.990
of this diaspora through
those photographs.

00:12:39.990 --> 00:12:44.140
And the book is the
product of that decision.

00:12:44.140 --> 00:12:52.100
So this is the map that
we developed as part

00:12:52.100 --> 00:12:56.890
of the project of developing
the book.

00:12:56.890 --> 00:13:00.340
We've marked enclaves where
we've either conducted research,

00:13:00.340 --> 00:13:01.710
or intend to conduct research.

00:13:01.710 --> 00:13:03.010
It's not complete.

00:13:03.010 --> 00:13:06.030
The book has been out for,
I guess, 6 or 8 months now.

00:13:06.030 --> 00:13:09.950
We've already got lots of angry
E-mails saying, "Bethlehem,

00:13:09.950 --> 00:13:11.900
Pennsylvania's not
on there" [laughter]

00:13:11.900 --> 00:13:15.400
and so we'll be adding to it.

00:13:15.400 --> 00:13:18.690
But, in general terms,
I have, you know,

00:13:18.690 --> 00:13:20.790
I'm going to give you
a very quick overview

00:13:20.790 --> 00:13:24.170
of the diaspora and of the book.

00:13:24.170 --> 00:13:26.840
In general terms, we can
think that the Spaniards

00:13:26.840 --> 00:13:31.460
who came here either came via
formal recruitment efforts

00:13:31.460 --> 00:13:36.100
where an American company would
actually go to Spain and put

00:13:36.100 --> 00:13:40.270
up signs and actively
recruit Spanish laborers

00:13:40.270 --> 00:13:42.750
for specific industry or task.

00:13:42.750 --> 00:13:47.580 position:56%
And then, what's more common, are
more informal networks that develop.

00:13:47.580 --> 00:13:51.060
This is typical in Spanish
immigration to Latin America

00:13:51.060 --> 00:13:56.180
as well, these informal networks of
families and towns and industries

00:13:56.180 --> 00:14:02.590
and sectors of the economy develop
where countrymen from one part

00:14:02.590 --> 00:14:06.450
of Spain settle themselves in
a certain place and involved

00:14:06.450 --> 00:14:07.980
in a certain sector of the economy.

00:14:07.980 --> 00:14:12.480
And they start bringing cousins
and nephews and uncles and such.

00:14:12.480 --> 00:14:15.410
So there are formal
arrangements, formal recruitment,

00:14:15.410 --> 00:14:18.330
and a lot of informal networking.

00:14:18.330 --> 00:14:22.370
In terms of the formal
arrangements, by far, the largest

00:14:22.370 --> 00:14:27.460
and most interesting and
bizarre episode in the history

00:14:27.460 --> 00:14:33.310
of Spanish immigration to the U.S.
occurred between 1907 and 1913

00:14:33.310 --> 00:14:38.340
when the Hawaiian sugarcane
planters association wanted

00:14:38.340 --> 00:14:43.640
to recruit white workers to work

00:14:43.640 --> 00:14:48.000
on the sugarcane plantations
of the Hawaiian Islands.

00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:52.650
And they started this vast campaign
of recruiting, they recruited many,

00:14:52.650 --> 00:14:55.440
the recruited many
people from Puerto Rico.

00:14:55.440 --> 00:14:59.540
They recruited many, probably
the largest number from Portugal.

00:14:59.540 --> 00:15:02.340
But, for this 6 year period
between 1907 and 1913,

00:15:02.340 --> 00:15:06.460
they also concentrated on southern
Spain where, in the provinces

00:15:06.460 --> 00:15:09.370
of Malaga and Granada,
they've been growing sugarcane

00:15:09.370 --> 00:15:11.130
for over a thousand years.

00:15:11.130 --> 00:15:14.670
The sugarcane planters
in Hawaii knew this.

00:15:14.670 --> 00:15:19.580
Remember, the United States
took over Hawaii in 1898 and so,

00:15:19.580 --> 00:15:25.180
we're in 1907, there's
explicit attempt to whiten

00:15:25.180 --> 00:15:29.080
and improve the gene stock
of the Hawaiian Islands

00:15:29.080 --> 00:15:32.210
by recruiting white
European workers.

00:15:32.210 --> 00:15:34.340
And so the planters look
around the globe and see

00:15:34.340 --> 00:15:37.480
where are there white folk that
know how to work with sugarcane,

00:15:37.480 --> 00:15:39.980
and the Madeira, the Azores,

00:15:39.980 --> 00:15:43.630
Southern Spain and
the Caribbean also.

00:15:43.630 --> 00:15:48.160
Within 6 years, they recruited
8,000 Spaniards to make the more

00:15:48.160 --> 00:15:54.090
than 50 day voyage to Hawaii from
-- the first ship left from Malaga,

00:15:54.090 --> 00:15:57.130
the next 6 left from Gibraltar.

00:15:57.130 --> 00:15:59.940
Remember, the Panama
Canal was not open yet,

00:15:59.940 --> 00:16:02.640
it was actually being
constructed, so it was a journey

00:16:02.640 --> 00:16:06.580
across the Atlantic
around South America

00:16:06.580 --> 00:16:09.050
into the Pacific and up to Hawaii.

00:16:09.050 --> 00:16:13.390
Eight thousand Spaniards took
that journey and, roughly,

00:16:13.390 --> 00:16:15.290
two-thirds of them,
within a few years,

00:16:15.290 --> 00:16:18.390
realized that Hawaii was not
what they were looking for.

00:16:18.390 --> 00:16:20.920
And they were not satisfied
with the conditions

00:16:20.920 --> 00:16:26.080
and made a quick second
emigration to California

00:16:26.080 --> 00:16:27.780
where they settled
around Sacramento.

00:16:27.780 --> 00:16:31.630
And many of the dots that you
see there correspond to enclaves

00:16:31.630 --> 00:16:34.610
of Spaniards who are
actually rebounding

00:16:34.610 --> 00:16:35.910
from the Hawaiian Islands.

00:16:35.910 --> 00:16:39.770
And they work predominantly
in agriculture, in fruit

00:16:39.770 --> 00:16:47.000
and nut harvesting and also
in fishing and fish canneries.

00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:49.210
So that's sort of the
biggest and clearest example

00:16:49.210 --> 00:16:51.230
of direct, active recruiting.

00:16:51.230 --> 00:16:56.800
Most of the other examples
are less direct.

00:16:56.800 --> 00:17:02.060
But I'll point out, because we
have some members in the audience

00:17:02.060 --> 00:17:08.740
from Tampa, Tampa, Florida became a
crucial enclave of Spaniards vast.

00:17:08.740 --> 00:17:12.530
By far, if we want to find
a place in the United States

00:17:12.530 --> 00:17:16.680
where this history that I'm talking
about has left a visible trace,

00:17:16.680 --> 00:17:20.100
Tampa, Florida is the
place we need to go.

00:17:20.100 --> 00:17:27.450
In 1886, a Valencian born cigar
maker, Vicente Martinez Ybor,

00:17:27.450 --> 00:17:34.560
decided to move his cigar
making center from Key West,

00:17:34.560 --> 00:17:37.390
where he had moved in
1869, that's another story.

00:17:37.390 --> 00:17:39.490 position:56%
The book has the date 1868 in there,

00:17:39.490 --> 00:17:42.350
if I had more time, I'd
explain why that is.

00:17:42.350 --> 00:17:47.370
In any case, Tampa, Florida becomes
the center of the cigar trade,

00:17:47.370 --> 00:17:50.320
Cuban cigar trade, in 1886.

00:17:50.320 --> 00:17:52.630
And, within a few decades
-- I should point out,

00:17:52.630 --> 00:17:56.830
Tampa had a population
of 700 in 1886

00:17:56.830 --> 00:18:02.060
when Vicente Martinez Ybor opened
his factory in the part of --

00:18:02.060 --> 00:18:04.520
now part of Tampa called Ybor City.

00:18:04.520 --> 00:18:08.410
Within a couple of decades, it
had a population of over 100,000.

00:18:08.410 --> 00:18:13.010
And, at its peak, Tampa had more
than 200 cigar factories and turned

00:18:13.010 --> 00:18:15.450
out a million cigars a day.

00:18:15.450 --> 00:18:18.940
It was the capital of cigar
production in the world.

00:18:18.940 --> 00:18:21.290
And the owners of most
of those factories were

00:18:21.290 --> 00:18:23.740
from Spain, Spanish born.

00:18:23.740 --> 00:18:26.530
Many of the workers were Spanish
born, there were also a lot

00:18:26.530 --> 00:18:29.530
of Cuban cigar makers, but the
owners of the factories were,

00:18:29.530 --> 00:18:33.260
for the most part, immigrants
themselves from Spain.

00:18:33.260 --> 00:18:35.330
So that's the story of Tampa.

00:18:35.330 --> 00:18:38.590
The presence of Spaniards in
Tampa got so big that, of course,

00:18:38.590 --> 00:18:43.760
many Spaniards could make livings
having restaurants and cafes

00:18:43.760 --> 00:18:46.570
and dairies catering to
the Spaniards, all right.

00:18:46.570 --> 00:18:48.590
It was a community so large

00:18:48.590 --> 00:18:52.150
that it generated a diverse
economy of Spaniards.

00:18:52.150 --> 00:18:55.660 position:56%
Something similar happens in the New
York area, whereas, in California,

00:18:55.660 --> 00:18:59.150
we can say almost all of the
immigrants devoted themselves

00:18:59.150 --> 00:19:01.800
to agriculture and fishing.

00:19:01.800 --> 00:19:05.260
In the case of New York and
Tampa, to a certain extent,

00:19:05.260 --> 00:19:07.000
where the economy was very diverse,

00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:09.970
we have Spaniards in
all walks of life.

00:19:09.970 --> 00:19:14.850
Entertainment, food, hardly
anyone knows this, but the founder

00:19:14.850 --> 00:19:19.700
of Goya Foods which most Americans
associate with its consumers

00:19:19.700 --> 00:19:22.650
which are largely not
Spanish, but the founder

00:19:22.650 --> 00:19:24.950
of Goya Foods was from Burgos.

00:19:24.950 --> 00:19:28.540
Prudencio Unanue was a
Spaniard who formed part

00:19:28.540 --> 00:19:30.820 position:56%
of this same story that I'm telling.

00:19:30.820 --> 00:19:34.380
Gregorio Bustelo, you guys drink
-- before there was Starbucks,

00:19:34.380 --> 00:19:37.440
the only good coffee you
could get was Café Bustelo,

00:19:37.440 --> 00:19:40.300
dark roasted Latin style coffee.

00:19:40.300 --> 00:19:43.270
Gregorio Bustelo was
from Galicia, okay?

00:19:43.270 --> 00:19:45.820
We associate that brand with
Puerto Ricans and Cubans

00:19:45.820 --> 00:19:47.330
who are the main consumers,

00:19:47.330 --> 00:19:51.150
and to whom the product has
been marketed the most, okay?

00:19:51.150 --> 00:19:53.010
There are lots of dots

00:19:53.010 --> 00:19:56.650
in the western mountain states
corresponding mostly to enclaves

00:19:56.650 --> 00:19:59.790
of basks who were brought
over to work as shepherds

00:19:59.790 --> 00:20:05.540
on the vast ranches and shepherd
ranges of the Montana, Nevada,

00:20:05.540 --> 00:20:09.060
Idaho and Washington State.

00:20:09.060 --> 00:20:13.530
There's also in the
audience, I just today,

00:20:13.530 --> 00:20:15.590
met someone who I've
been corresponding

00:20:15.590 --> 00:20:20.390
with for some years now who's
a representative of Spaniards

00:20:20.390 --> 00:20:22.560
in the area of St. Louis, Missouri.

00:20:22.560 --> 00:20:27.850
And there's a whole archipelago
of enclaves around the center

00:20:27.850 --> 00:20:33.260 position:56%
of the country, most of which have
something to do with metal industry.

00:20:33.260 --> 00:20:36.050
Again, I can't go into
the details of the story,

00:20:36.050 --> 00:20:41.080
but there was a zinc foundry in
a part of Asturias in the county

00:20:41.080 --> 00:20:45.600
of Castile Leon which is actually
where my grandfather is from.

00:20:45.600 --> 00:20:49.300
A zinc foundry that
exported thousands of workers

00:20:49.300 --> 00:20:52.540
to similar factories
wherever there was zinc.

00:20:52.540 --> 00:20:55.350
So Luis and I have learned
this in our research,

00:20:55.350 --> 00:20:58.310
if we want to identify
enclaves of Spaniards,

00:20:58.310 --> 00:21:01.170
one of the things we can do is to
go to guides of industry and find

00:21:01.170 --> 00:21:03.880
out where there was
zinc in, say, 1910.

00:21:03.880 --> 00:21:07.340
Wherever there was zinc,
there were Spaniards.

00:21:07.340 --> 00:21:10.760
Unlikely places like West Virginia.

00:21:10.760 --> 00:21:15.150
There were so many Spanish
workers in West Virginia in 1910

00:21:15.150 --> 00:21:19.070
that an honorary Spanish
consulate was set up in Clarksburg,

00:21:19.070 --> 00:21:23.550
West Virginia to attend
to the Spanish workers.

00:21:23.550 --> 00:21:28.750
So West Virginia, the St. Louis
area on both sides of the river,

00:21:28.750 --> 00:21:34.900
many Spanish immigrants,
mostly from Asturias and mostly

00:21:34.900 --> 00:21:39.300
from this very region around Arnaud
[phonetic] right near Aviles,

00:21:39.300 --> 00:21:42.210
Consejo de Castilla y Leon.

00:21:42.210 --> 00:21:45.930
So all those dots in Donora,
Pennsylvania, Spelter,

00:21:45.930 --> 00:21:50.620
West Virginia, Kent in
Ohio, those all correspond

00:21:50.620 --> 00:21:53.200
to what we call the zinc circuit.

00:21:53.200 --> 00:21:57.410
So just to give a rough idea of
where these, how this map was made

00:21:57.410 --> 00:22:00.120
and where these folks settled.

00:22:00.120 --> 00:22:08.070
So the book, we analyzed the oral
histories that we had collected,

00:22:08.070 --> 00:22:14.770 position:56%
and we looked over this vast archive
of images, and came up with a story

00:22:14.770 --> 00:22:17.780
that it's not any one
immigrant's story,

00:22:17.780 --> 00:22:21.690
but it's kind of a composite
average story based on all

00:22:21.690 --> 00:22:24.210
of the information
that we've gathered.

00:22:24.210 --> 00:22:28.280
And we created 6 chapters in the
book, each chapter corresponded

00:22:28.280 --> 00:22:31.590
to one of the sentences
of the story, which,

00:22:31.590 --> 00:22:33.600
as you can see, is very simple.

00:22:33.600 --> 00:22:39.350
In time of great upheavals among
millions of other immigrants,

00:22:39.350 --> 00:22:42.040
they were but a drop in the bucket.

00:22:42.040 --> 00:22:46.560
In chapter 1, contains photographs
that we scanned from family albums

00:22:46.560 --> 00:22:53.040
of life in Spain prior,
immediately prior to the departure

00:22:53.040 --> 00:22:54.390
and also the kinds of images

00:22:54.390 --> 00:22:58.020
that the immigrants brought
with them from Spain.

00:22:58.020 --> 00:23:00.370
They arrived and spread
out all over the country

00:23:00.370 --> 00:23:02.480
in search of opportunities.

00:23:02.480 --> 00:23:05.720
Chapter 2 is devoted to work,
the kinds of work that they did

00:23:05.720 --> 00:23:09.160
and the photographs that
they made of their work.

00:23:09.160 --> 00:23:12.970
Chapter 3, together
they laughed and cried,

00:23:12.970 --> 00:23:14.980
together they lived and loved.

00:23:14.980 --> 00:23:20.240
This is the longest chapter of the
book that looks at social customs,

00:23:20.240 --> 00:23:25.690
leisure time, cultural
activities, courtship, marriage,

00:23:25.690 --> 00:23:29.620
children and the fabric of life.

00:23:29.620 --> 00:23:35.050 position:56%
Chapter 4 is about the organizations
that the Spaniards formed,

00:23:35.050 --> 00:23:40.260
I'll talk a little bit about
that when we get to that chapter.

00:23:40.260 --> 00:23:43.870
But they formed vast networks
of very diverse organizations

00:23:43.870 --> 00:23:46.510
to take care of each other.

00:23:46.510 --> 00:23:53.900
Chapter 5, they got organized and
rallied behind a cause that lost.

00:23:53.900 --> 00:23:56.650
The impact of the Spanish Civil War

00:23:56.650 --> 00:23:59.250
on this community cannot
be underestimated,

00:23:59.250 --> 00:24:02.510
and it played a crucial role in
the kinds of decisions they made

00:24:02.510 --> 00:24:06.500
about where they were from and
where they wanted to be from.

00:24:06.500 --> 00:24:09.260
And, finally, they were here
to stay, the last chapter,

00:24:09.260 --> 00:24:11.680
contains images of assimilation,

00:24:11.680 --> 00:24:19.220
those images of becoming
permanently American.

00:24:21.900 --> 00:24:28.870
So chapter 1, we have lots
of photographs like this one

00:24:28.870 --> 00:24:32.590
which is a picture
of those left behind.

00:24:32.590 --> 00:24:35.000
Many family albums
contain photographs

00:24:35.000 --> 00:24:37.480
of the loved ones who
didn't emigrate.

00:24:37.480 --> 00:24:43.410
This is a family in Alicante in
the village of Casas del Senor.

00:24:43.410 --> 00:24:46.900
And these are the folks
who didn't come, okay.

00:24:46.900 --> 00:24:50.410
It's from an album in
Monterey, California.

00:24:50.410 --> 00:24:55.970 position:56%
The relatives of these folks went to
Hawaii and ended up in California.

00:24:57.080 --> 00:25:01.280
The grandson of these folks would
become the Mayor of Monterey,

00:25:01.280 --> 00:25:03.820
California and serve for
20 years as the Mayor

00:25:03.820 --> 00:25:06.970
of Monterey from 1986 to 2006.

00:25:06.970 --> 00:25:11.020
Our first documentary film is
a portrait of Daniel Albert

00:25:11.020 --> 00:25:13.970
in his original Valenciano name,

00:25:13.970 --> 00:25:20.110
Dan Albert in perfect English
[laughter], an amazing character.

00:25:20.110 --> 00:25:30.490
Let's see, this is the house that
those people lived in in Alicante.

00:25:33.010 --> 00:25:36.830 position:56%
This is a typical portrait of
immigrant on the eve of immigration.

00:25:36.830 --> 00:25:41.000
This is from Lugo.

00:25:41.000 --> 00:25:44.150
Jose Vasquez was about
to leave for Cuba.

00:25:44.150 --> 00:25:48.120
We'll see him later in New York
in front of his clothes store.

00:25:49.190 --> 00:25:55.930
The family saved many documents,
including this incredible poster

00:25:55.930 --> 00:25:58.200
that was put up all
over southern Spain.

00:25:58.200 --> 00:26:04.780 position:56%
This is a scan of an original poster
promising [inaudible] to Spaniards

00:26:04.780 --> 00:26:08.610
who were willing to get on
the ship and go to Hawaii.

00:26:08.610 --> 00:26:12.040
It lays out the conditions
and describes Hawaii

00:26:12.040 --> 00:26:17.640
in these terms of paradise.

00:26:17.640 --> 00:26:23.110
Also, a lot of pictures in family
albums are, as I said before,

00:26:23.110 --> 00:26:25.720
like relics from the old country.

00:26:25.720 --> 00:26:29.390
These 2 pictures are, especially
interesting because, on the left,

00:26:29.390 --> 00:26:32.830
is Juan Sanchez Aricon
[phonetic] of Cadiz,

00:26:32.830 --> 00:26:38.730
of San Roque in his army outfit
which he wore when he was sent

00:26:38.730 --> 00:26:43.200
to fight in the Spanish
American War in 1896.

00:26:43.200 --> 00:26:46.320
And we see the same Juan
Sanchez Aricon on the right

00:26:46.320 --> 00:26:51.370
at a photographic studio at La
Limia shortly before embarking,

00:26:51.370 --> 00:26:53.870
once again to cross the Atlantic,
but this time to continue

00:26:53.870 --> 00:27:00.030 position:56%
on to the Pacific and become a sugar
cane worker on the Hawaiian islands.

00:27:00.030 --> 00:27:02.180
He'd serve in the army
of the country

00:27:02.180 --> 00:27:05.500
that he fought against
in World War I.

00:27:05.500 --> 00:27:06.880
And it's not that uncommon.

00:27:06.880 --> 00:27:09.730
These folks, they were in the
Spanish American War fighting

00:27:09.730 --> 00:27:13.160
for Spain in the late
1800s and drafted to fight

00:27:13.160 --> 00:27:16.960
in the U.S. Army in World War I.

00:27:19.550 --> 00:27:22.170
The descendants of this
photograph are in the audience.

00:27:22.170 --> 00:27:24.770
I've just met them.

00:27:24.770 --> 00:27:30.420 position:56%
This is a portrait of Santa Maria
del Mar in the county of Castrillon.

00:27:30.420 --> 00:27:34.260
This is the Fernandez
Menendez family,

00:27:34.260 --> 00:27:37.940
the entire family emigrated
to the Saint Louis area.

00:27:37.940 --> 00:27:42.360
And this is the typical, kind
of portrait on the vispera,

00:27:42.360 --> 00:27:43.930
the eve of departure,

00:27:43.930 --> 00:27:49.720
kind of documenting this is what
we look like just before we go.

00:27:53.050 --> 00:27:56.760
The second chapter, they arrived
and spread out all over the country

00:27:56.760 --> 00:27:58.060
in search of opportunities.

00:27:58.060 --> 00:28:00.870
This is a group of Galician
immigrants aboard the ship

00:28:00.870 --> 00:28:05.470
that brought them, Ocupania
[phonetic] in the family album

00:28:05.470 --> 00:28:08.160
of Valego [phonetic]
in Newark, New Jersey.

00:28:08.160 --> 00:28:10.830
This is the exploration
of their places of work.

00:28:10.830 --> 00:28:16.080 position:56%
We realized, as we did this chapter,
that there are some work places

00:28:16.080 --> 00:28:17.880
where you don't take your camera.

00:28:17.880 --> 00:28:23.310
So people that worked inside
mines or digging tunnels

00:28:23.310 --> 00:28:27.290 position:56%
or in the engine room of a ship
which are vast amounts of Spaniards,

00:28:27.290 --> 00:28:30.400
those are very typical occupation,

00:28:30.400 --> 00:28:32.420
we don't really have
photographs of that.

00:28:32.420 --> 00:28:36.790 position:56%
Whereas, we have a preponderance of
photos of Spaniards proudly standing

00:28:36.790 --> 00:28:38.610
in front of their businesses.

00:28:38.610 --> 00:28:41.710
So the small business person,
the guy who owned a cigar factory

00:28:41.710 --> 00:28:47.000
or a hardware store or a boarding
house or a café, we have many,

00:28:47.000 --> 00:28:49.200
many beautiful pictures
of that genre.

00:28:49.200 --> 00:28:52.250
But we should keep in mind that a
lot of these folks were in places

00:28:52.250 --> 00:28:54.830
where cameras didn't go, okay.

00:28:54.830 --> 00:29:02.560
Documents like passports or visas,
like this one, here's a picture

00:29:02.560 --> 00:29:12.270
of -- I'm sorry, that's
a passport I guess, yeah.

00:29:12.270 --> 00:29:16.540
This is a photograph
of Tampa cigar workers

00:29:16.540 --> 00:29:19.130
at a boarding house in Ybor City.

00:29:20.610 --> 00:29:24.720
These are recently arrived
immigrants from Galicia,

00:29:24.720 --> 00:29:30.220
from Sava in the province of A
Coruna on the house of the tenement

00:29:30.220 --> 00:29:32.460
where they lived on
the Lower East Side

00:29:32.460 --> 00:29:36.190
with the Manhattan
Bridge in the background.

00:29:36.190 --> 00:29:41.140
Again, this photograph which looks
like it should be in a museum is

00:29:41.140 --> 00:29:45.650
in the family album of the Sanchez
Alonso family in Astoria Queens.

00:29:45.650 --> 00:29:48.810
And, like this, hundreds
of documents

00:29:48.810 --> 00:29:54.300
that we're doing everything
we can to preserve.

00:29:54.300 --> 00:30:00.480
These are, this is the staff
of a legendary Basque hotel

00:30:00.480 --> 00:30:03.590
in the West Village,
Valentina Gira, crucial figure

00:30:03.590 --> 00:30:06.670
in the history of Spanish
immigration.

00:30:06.670 --> 00:30:11.280
Valentina Gira had several sons,
he'd send them to the docks.

00:30:11.280 --> 00:30:15.110
When the ships bearing Spaniards
would come in, they would shout

00:30:15.110 --> 00:30:17.940
in Basque and in Spanish
[foreign language spoken], oh,

00:30:17.940 --> 00:30:22.390
if you follow me, all Basques
and Spaniards, he'd take them

00:30:22.390 --> 00:30:27.190
to 82 Bank Street where they'd
get a room and a meal and advice

00:30:27.190 --> 00:30:28.980 position:56%
about where to find work, very often

00:30:28.980 --> 00:30:31.200
in those sheep ranches
out in the west.

00:30:31.200 --> 00:30:35.430 position:56%
Valentina Gira was in constant
contact with his Basque compatriots.

00:30:35.430 --> 00:30:39.560 position:56%
He had a vast network, and he worked
basically an employment agency

00:30:39.560 --> 00:30:41.410
out of this location.

00:30:41.410 --> 00:30:44.970
The building still stands
in the West Village.

00:30:46.230 --> 00:30:47.870
Here's that same fellow
we saw before,

00:30:47.870 --> 00:30:50.290
Jose Vasquez on the
eve of his departure.

00:30:50.290 --> 00:30:52.880
He was in Cuba for some
years, then came to New York,

00:30:52.880 --> 00:30:56.700
ended up owning a woman's
clothing store on 14th Street

00:30:56.700 --> 00:30:58.000
which was the heart

00:30:58.000 --> 00:31:03.020
of a neighborhood once called
Little Spain, La Vernia [phonetic].

00:31:06.570 --> 00:31:11.460
A grocery store in West Tampa
which had rooms above it

00:31:11.460 --> 00:31:15.720
for single cigar workers,
bachelor cigar workers.

00:31:15.720 --> 00:31:23.700
This is a factory crew at the zinc
foundry in Spelter, West Virginia.

00:31:25.490 --> 00:31:29.870
The Basque Hotel in San Francisco,

00:31:29.870 --> 00:31:32.490
I'm pretty sure this is prior
to the great earthquake.

00:31:32.490 --> 00:31:36.340
I think this hotel
burned down in 1906.

00:31:38.820 --> 00:31:44.920
Migrant Spanish farmworkers
near Vacaville in California,

00:31:44.920 --> 00:31:49.030 position:56%
notice the tents in the
background, these Spaniards traveled

00:31:49.030 --> 00:31:52.140
around like many people do today,

00:31:52.140 --> 00:31:54.030
many Spanish speaking
people do today

00:31:54.030 --> 00:31:56.380 position:56%
in California still, mostly Mexican.

00:31:56.380 --> 00:32:00.770 position:56%
Traveling up and down the
California Valley based on the cycle

00:32:00.770 --> 00:32:03.360
of the harvest of the crops.

00:32:03.360 --> 00:32:06.210
There were Spaniards doing
this in the '20s and '30s.

00:32:06.210 --> 00:32:09.590
And here's a group of Spanish
children and those tents are

00:32:09.590 --> 00:32:12.940
where they would sleep
in harvest season.

00:32:17.510 --> 00:32:23.890
Uh-oh. Okay, I don't
know what happened there.

00:32:23.890 --> 00:32:25.190
That's okay.

00:32:25.190 --> 00:32:29.100
This is a very moving picture of
the burial of a cannery worker

00:32:29.100 --> 00:32:32.080
in Monterey, California,
a young Spaniard who died

00:32:32.080 --> 00:32:34.640
in an industrial accident.

00:32:34.640 --> 00:32:39.480
Next chapter, living la vida,
in Spanglish, because that sort

00:32:39.480 --> 00:32:42.460
of started becoming the
language spoken by this community

00:32:42.460 --> 00:32:46.800
as they had children and adapted
to life in the United States.

00:32:46.800 --> 00:32:52.600
Chapter devoted to, as I said
before, leisure, fun, courtship,

00:32:52.600 --> 00:32:54.490
marriage, things like that.

00:32:54.490 --> 00:32:57.490
Again, beautiful photographs.

00:32:57.490 --> 00:32:59.610
The beach, this is
Rye Beach, New York,

00:32:59.610 --> 00:33:02.050
bunch of Asturian girls [laughter].

00:33:04.380 --> 00:33:10.600
It was very common to take
these kind of gag photographs,

00:33:10.600 --> 00:33:14.130
especially a newly arrived
Spanish immigrant would think,

00:33:14.130 --> 00:33:16.840
oh what a joke, I'm driving a car.

00:33:16.840 --> 00:33:19.930
It was like it was so outlandish,
especially if they sent this back

00:33:19.930 --> 00:33:22.770
to the village, that it was funny.

00:33:22.770 --> 00:33:25.680
But the remarkable thing
is that 3 or 5 years later,

00:33:25.680 --> 00:33:29.110
they'll be sending back photos
of them actually driving cars.

00:33:29.110 --> 00:33:33.480
But, yeah, right now it's a gag.

00:33:33.480 --> 00:33:36.160
Many beautiful studio
portraits often taken

00:33:36.160 --> 00:33:38.830
to send back to the relatives.

00:33:38.830 --> 00:33:42.930
This is a pool room in Ybor
City, not a place you'd want

00:33:42.930 --> 00:33:47.940
to get caught late at night,
if you're not from Ybor City.

00:33:47.940 --> 00:33:52.340
This is a gorgeous photograph,
it looks like Asturias.

00:33:52.340 --> 00:33:58.490
The Asturian born Angel Alonso
[phonetic] who lost his job

00:33:58.490 --> 00:34:00.560
in New York during the Depression,

00:34:00.560 --> 00:34:03.720
and went back to doing what he knew
how to do best which was farming.

00:34:03.720 --> 00:34:07.880
He moved to upstate New York and
rented a farm and grew apples

00:34:07.880 --> 00:34:13.830
and made hay and had cows and
he's in Walk Hill, New York,

00:34:13.830 --> 00:34:16.950
and it looks like he's
back in Navares Asturias

00:34:16.950 --> 00:34:20.440
which was his hometown
near Arriondas.

00:34:20.440 --> 00:34:24.060
His children were born in New
York and Manuel is still alive,

00:34:24.060 --> 00:34:27.490
one of my main informants,
the fellow on the right.

00:34:27.490 --> 00:34:33.420
He's 95. That farm that they
set up became, eventually,

00:34:33.420 --> 00:34:35.650
a kind of boarding house, a
hotel, where they would take

00:34:35.650 --> 00:34:38.010
in other Spanish families in the
summer months who were trying

00:34:38.010 --> 00:34:39.410
to get away from the
heat of the city

00:34:39.410 --> 00:34:43.500
and eat some fresh
food and speak Spanish.

00:34:43.500 --> 00:34:45.400
My family's actually
in this photograph,

00:34:45.400 --> 00:34:49.340
my father's the little boy in
the very center of the picture,

00:34:49.340 --> 00:34:52.000
because his family would
occasionally spend a week there

00:34:52.000 --> 00:34:56.050
in the summer, again, to get out
of the sweltering heat of the city.

00:34:56.050 --> 00:35:02.380
It's so moving to find photographs
of one family in the album

00:35:02.380 --> 00:35:05.820
of another family, but it's
happening to us more and more.

00:35:05.820 --> 00:35:08.650
So I was looking through the
photographs of the Alonso family

00:35:08.650 --> 00:35:11.150
and came across this
photo of my grandfather

00:35:11.150 --> 00:35:14.060
and grandmother and parents.

00:35:14.060 --> 00:35:19.280
Some photographs, like this,
have almost allegorical value

00:35:19.280 --> 00:35:22.770
because this is a family
of Sevillanos who went

00:35:22.770 --> 00:35:25.180
to Hawaii and then to California.

00:35:25.180 --> 00:35:28.200 position:56%
And it's almost as if their stringed
instruments were allegorically

00:35:28.200 --> 00:35:29.670
telling the story [laughter].

00:35:29.670 --> 00:35:33.200
They've got the Spanish
guitar, the Hawaiian ukulele

00:35:33.200 --> 00:35:35.500
and the American banjo [laughter].

00:35:38.670 --> 00:35:42.380
The next chapter is about the
organizations that they formed.

00:35:42.380 --> 00:35:45.890
Like all other immigrants who came
to the U.S. before the New Deal,

00:35:45.890 --> 00:35:49.240
the Spaniards landed in a country
where there was no safety net,

00:35:49.240 --> 00:35:52.310
no ready-made welfare state,
there was no social security,

00:35:52.310 --> 00:35:55.120
no unemployment insurance,
no medical insurance.

00:35:55.120 --> 00:35:58.460
And these Spaniards all over the
U.S. responded to this situation

00:35:58.460 --> 00:36:02.570
with an astounding spirit of
entrepreneurship and solidarity,

00:36:02.570 --> 00:36:05.560
forming all manners of
clubs and organizations

00:36:05.560 --> 00:36:07.380
to help them care for one another.

00:36:07.380 --> 00:36:09.490
So this is a picnic,
this is one-fourth

00:36:09.490 --> 00:36:13.450
of a vast panoramic picture
of the Spanish community

00:36:13.450 --> 00:36:16.680
in Cleveland, Ohio, 1930.

00:36:16.680 --> 00:36:24.370 position:56%
Another Saint Louis picture, this is
the -- the building still exists --

00:36:24.370 --> 00:36:29.520
this is the Sociedad Espanola
of Saint Louis, Missouri.

00:36:29.520 --> 00:36:32.480
They brought with them a game,
El Hoyo Del La Jave [phonetic]

00:36:32.480 --> 00:36:36.780
which many Spaniards probably don't
know because it's very peculiar

00:36:36.780 --> 00:36:39.050
to the area of Asturias
where they're from.

00:36:39.050 --> 00:36:41.210
But the guy in the front
is holding this pole

00:36:41.210 --> 00:36:44.430
with these aspas [phonetic]
and the game consisted

00:36:44.430 --> 00:36:47.640
of throwing these metal discs
from a certain distance and trying

00:36:47.640 --> 00:36:53.250
to hit those blades on that stick.

00:36:53.250 --> 00:36:56.820
There's still a league of La Jave
in Saint Louis, I've been told,

00:36:56.820 --> 00:37:04.990
and you can still go there and play
and probably gamble, I would guess.

00:37:04.990 --> 00:37:10.390 position:56%
Canton, Ohio, I mentioned it before,
had a very active social club.

00:37:10.390 --> 00:37:14.870 position:56%
And Canton is unusual because, as I
mentioned before, one of the streams

00:37:14.870 --> 00:37:18.920 position:56%
of immigrants are the Asturianos
who come following the zinc circuit.

00:37:18.920 --> 00:37:21.860
The other stream are on
the [inaudible] who come

00:37:21.860 --> 00:37:25.330
from the Rio Tinto, Rio Tinto mines

00:37:25.330 --> 00:37:27.340
in the province of
Nuerva [phonetic].

00:37:27.340 --> 00:37:30.890 position:56%
There's a lot of labor unrest and
people are being laid off their jobs

00:37:30.890 --> 00:37:32.700
in the teens and into the twenties.

00:37:32.700 --> 00:37:36.820
And there's a mini diaspara of
[inaudible] from the province

00:37:36.820 --> 00:37:40.530
of Huelva to Canton where
they mix with the Spaniards.

00:37:40.530 --> 00:37:45.120
And so their annual picnics have
both flamenco guitar and gaita.

00:37:45.120 --> 00:37:48.040
And we've documented cases
of Asturian boys who learned

00:37:48.040 --> 00:37:52.560
to become flamenco musicians
because of this mingling,

00:37:52.560 --> 00:37:56.650
something that is not likely
to happen on the peninsula.

00:37:56.650 --> 00:38:00.760
This is the Centro Vasco
Americano in New York.

00:38:00.760 --> 00:38:03.090
The picture's taken
in the club's fronton.

00:38:03.090 --> 00:38:08.830
They had an indoor handball
jai alai court from 1930.

00:38:11.180 --> 00:38:18.210
Soccer teams, again from
Saint Louis, [inaudible] 1934.

00:38:18.210 --> 00:38:24.220
And in other places
like Tampa, Florida,

00:38:24.220 --> 00:38:27.420
where there was more
contact with the Cuban world,

00:38:27.420 --> 00:38:31.010 position:56%
baseball took precedence over soccer

00:38:31.010 --> 00:38:33.230
and baseball was bigger
in Tampa than soccer.

00:38:33.230 --> 00:38:36.580
And the Centro Asturiano
had its own ball team.

00:38:36.580 --> 00:38:41.450
Some very famous professional
baseball players

00:38:41.450 --> 00:38:44.330
of Spanish descent emerged.

00:38:44.330 --> 00:38:47.750
I'll mention a couple
in my conclusion.

00:38:47.750 --> 00:38:50.260
Families conserved
a lot of documents,

00:38:50.260 --> 00:38:53.800
like this membership
book, actually a dues book

00:38:53.800 --> 00:38:59.120
from the Union Benefica
Espanola De Hollister California.

00:38:59.120 --> 00:39:03.500
This is the Majestic Theater

00:39:03.500 --> 00:39:06.980
of Tampa's Centro Asturiano
which still stands.

00:39:06.980 --> 00:39:10.610
I think there's 1400
seats in that auditorium.

00:39:10.610 --> 00:39:14.100
It hosted artists like Enrico
Caruso and other greats.

00:39:14.100 --> 00:39:18.140
It was, for many years, one of
the best venues in all of Florida,

00:39:18.140 --> 00:39:21.440
in terms of its acoustics
for music and theater.

00:39:21.440 --> 00:39:25.020 position:56%
And this is a celebration, or the --

00:39:25.020 --> 00:39:29.190
it's a meeting commemorating the
6 months of a workers' strike,

00:39:29.190 --> 00:39:32.780
a cigar workers' strike in 1920.

00:39:34.680 --> 00:39:41.060
The Spanish Civil War, by the time
the war breaks out in July of 1936,

00:39:41.060 --> 00:39:44.130
the colonies of Spanish immigrants
all over the United States are

00:39:44.130 --> 00:39:47.940
at their peak in terms of
numbers and cohesiveness.

00:39:47.940 --> 00:39:52.660
So they've been arriving
steadily from 1898 to 1920, 22,

00:39:52.660 --> 00:39:55.060
when those quota laws
are put in place

00:39:55.060 --> 00:39:57.130
and it becomes much
harder to get in.

00:39:57.130 --> 00:40:01.360
But they still get, continue to
get it in, lest everyone think

00:40:01.360 --> 00:40:05.160
that they were all legal, uh-unh.

00:40:06.280 --> 00:40:12.680
And, actually, the Cuba,
Tampa entry was a lot easier

00:40:12.680 --> 00:40:15.760
than Ellis Island for, after
the quota laws were enacted

00:40:15.760 --> 00:40:17.240
for Spaniards.

00:40:17.240 --> 00:40:22.390
So the community is at
its highest point in terms

00:40:22.390 --> 00:40:24.180
of cohesiveness and numbers.

00:40:24.180 --> 00:40:27.660
If you think about it, the
Great Depression forced them

00:40:27.660 --> 00:40:29.440
into helping each other.

00:40:29.440 --> 00:40:32.140
So those organizations that they
founded, maybe at the beginning,

00:40:32.140 --> 00:40:36.230
they were supporting our cultural
organizations but, after 1929,

00:40:36.230 --> 00:40:39.890
they become mutual aid
societies or burial societies.

00:40:39.890 --> 00:40:42.560
There's a real need for the
community to help each other.

00:40:42.560 --> 00:40:47.140 position:56%
So throughout the early 1930s, those
clubs get stronger and stronger and,

00:40:47.140 --> 00:40:51.270
when the war breaks out in
Spain in 1936, the vast majority

00:40:51.270 --> 00:40:54.710
of these working class
immigrants were pro-Republican.

00:40:54.710 --> 00:40:58.640
And most of their clubs, in
fact, I can't find many examples

00:40:58.640 --> 00:41:04.500
of any clubs that were
pro-Insurgents, pro-Franco, right.

00:41:04.500 --> 00:41:06.550
So the vast majority of the
immigrants, and almost all

00:41:06.550 --> 00:41:12.520 position:56%
of their organizations, turned their
efforts to the raising supply --

00:41:12.520 --> 00:41:15.750
raising support for
the loyalist cause.

00:41:15.750 --> 00:41:21.150
And the family albums are
full of these documents.

00:41:21.150 --> 00:41:26.820
Stunning pictures like this
on 14th Street, outside of --

00:41:26.820 --> 00:41:30.780
it was actually they're picketing
a Spanish business which is proof

00:41:30.780 --> 00:41:34.040
that there were Spaniards
who were pro-Franco.

00:41:34.040 --> 00:41:35.340
That was Casa Moneo,

00:41:35.340 --> 00:41:38.650
a very important grocery
store on 14th Street.

00:41:38.650 --> 00:41:41.640
But this is, it looks
like a newspaper picture,

00:41:41.640 --> 00:41:44.340
but it's actually -- the person
who showed me this says, "Oh,

00:41:44.340 --> 00:41:48.810
that's my Aunt Zazi", so this
is a family picture [laughter].

00:41:52.430 --> 00:41:56.460
Fantastic portraits like this one,

00:41:56.460 --> 00:42:02.270
[foreign language spoken]
Canton, Ohio, 1937.

00:42:07.360 --> 00:42:12.360
Assorted pictures from the
album of a family in New Jersey.

00:42:12.360 --> 00:42:16.370
These are children in Tampa,
Florida dressed up like milicianas

00:42:16.370 --> 00:42:19.730
with the popular front salute.

00:42:19.730 --> 00:42:22.850
A mass meeting in Manhattan's
Center.

00:42:25.370 --> 00:42:29.260
A family in Canton, Ohio has
preserved all of the programs,

00:42:29.260 --> 00:42:33.210
since the 1930s, of the annual
Spanish Picnic organized

00:42:33.210 --> 00:42:36.500 position:56%
by the Spanish colonies of the area.

00:42:36.500 --> 00:42:39.620
In this juxtaposition of
2 of the program covers,

00:42:39.620 --> 00:42:42.890
the one on the left is from
1937, and the one on the right is

00:42:42.890 --> 00:42:47.040
from 1946, I think this
juxtaposition provides a perfect

00:42:47.040 --> 00:42:51.610
illustration of the process I'm
trying to document and describe

00:42:51.610 --> 00:42:55.750
in which the Spanish Civil
War marks a point of no return

00:42:55.750 --> 00:42:59.490
for the immigrants in the U.S.
The language and the design

00:42:59.490 --> 00:43:03.420
of these 2 covers shows that
something catastrophic has occurred

00:43:03.420 --> 00:43:06.050
between 1 cover and
the other, right.

00:43:06.050 --> 00:43:07.820
From a Spanish speaking community

00:43:07.820 --> 00:43:13.280 position:56%
on the left still looking back
towards Spain, still living in Spain

00:43:13.280 --> 00:43:17.770
in some ways, still deeply involved
in the affairs of the old country.

00:43:17.770 --> 00:43:23.530
In 9 years, we move to a community
that's English speaking and that,

00:43:23.530 --> 00:43:27.030
this very forward looking
American family which seems well

00:43:27.030 --> 00:43:29.210
on its way to assimilation.

00:43:29.210 --> 00:43:34.090
So I think that this is a perfect
example of how, in our research,

00:43:34.090 --> 00:43:38.640 position:56%
we've learned that the Spanish Civil
War was really the point where most

00:43:38.640 --> 00:43:41.140
of these folks realized that,
if they dreamt about going back,

00:43:41.140 --> 00:43:46.330
it wasn't going to happen, or it
certainly wasn't going to be easy.

00:43:46.330 --> 00:43:49.550
I'll start wrapping up.

00:43:49.550 --> 00:43:51.270
They were here to stay.

00:43:51.270 --> 00:43:55.320
One of our standard questions,
when we interview the descendants

00:43:55.320 --> 00:43:58.530
of immigrants, is, if their
parents or grandparents had come

00:43:58.530 --> 00:44:02.220
to the U.S. knowing that they
would permanently stay here,

00:44:02.220 --> 00:44:06.590
or if they had come hoping to make
some money and return to Spain.

00:44:06.590 --> 00:44:11.180
And our informants, often, respond
with firmness, sometimes mixed

00:44:11.180 --> 00:44:14.220
with surprise, almost
annoyance at the question.

00:44:14.220 --> 00:44:17.930
Oh, no, they came here because
they wanted to become American.

00:44:17.930 --> 00:44:21.620
It's kind of the standard line
that we get from descendants

00:44:21.620 --> 00:44:25.410
of immigrants which
is really not true

00:44:25.410 --> 00:44:27.620
and has never historically
been true of any immigrant

00:44:27.620 --> 00:44:30.340
that ever left any country,
any time in the history

00:44:30.340 --> 00:44:32.710
of immigration [laughter].

00:44:32.710 --> 00:44:36.560
And those same people who, without
thinking about it, say, "Oh, no,

00:44:36.560 --> 00:44:40.350
they came knowing that they would
become Americans", they then start

00:44:40.350 --> 00:44:42.380
to tell us stories
and, in some cases,

00:44:42.380 --> 00:44:44.950
they share their archives with us.

00:44:44.950 --> 00:44:47.310
In many cases, those archives
have letters in Spanish

00:44:47.310 --> 00:44:49.010
that they haven't read,
or can't read,

00:44:49.010 --> 00:44:50.850
because they don't have Spanish.

00:44:50.850 --> 00:44:53.100
And it's always a much
more complicated picture

00:44:53.100 --> 00:44:56.950
and there's almost always
a burning desire to,

00:44:56.950 --> 00:45:00.350
at some point, go back to Spain.

00:45:00.350 --> 00:45:04.680
The Spanish Civil War is what
really kind of shuts that door.

00:45:04.680 --> 00:45:06.760
And we find this in
family after family.

00:45:06.760 --> 00:45:12.650
It's really only then that
that dream is put aside or,

00:45:12.650 --> 00:45:14.950
at least, postponed.

00:45:14.950 --> 00:45:18.220
Those same families that say,
"Oh, no, our parents came

00:45:18.220 --> 00:45:22.560
to become Americans", then we go
through the archive and we come

00:45:22.560 --> 00:45:26.130
across the Certificates
of Naturalization

00:45:26.130 --> 00:45:30.320
and it's 1939, 1940, 1941.

00:45:30.320 --> 00:45:34.310
And I'm thinking, okay,
your mother came in 1911.

00:45:34.310 --> 00:45:38.680
She registered in the Spanish
Consul every year, 1912, 13, 14,

00:45:38.680 --> 00:45:42.920
she'd go to San Francisco
to affirm her Spanishness

00:45:42.920 --> 00:45:45.400 position:56%
because she needed the assistance
of the Consulate and because, maybe,

00:45:45.400 --> 00:45:48.050
she dreamt of going back to Spain.

00:45:48.050 --> 00:45:52.950 position:56%
All those years, she was
maintaining her Spanish citizenship.

00:45:52.950 --> 00:45:57.310 position:56%
And, only in '39, '40, '41, does she
go and become an American citizen.

00:45:57.310 --> 00:45:59.410
I think, maybe, she was
hoping that maybe she would,

00:45:59.410 --> 00:46:01.520
someday, go back to Spain.

00:46:01.520 --> 00:46:06.510
This is a beautiful Thanksgiving
dinner in San Leandro, California.

00:46:06.510 --> 00:46:09.300
These were folks that had
passed through Hawaii.

00:46:11.710 --> 00:46:16.400 position:56%
I love these pictures of
multi-generations where you can see,

00:46:16.400 --> 00:46:18.300 position:56%
almost, the process of assimilation.

00:46:18.300 --> 00:46:22.430
The Spanish grandmother in the
dress and the Spanish granddaughter

00:46:22.430 --> 00:46:25.010
in the bathing suit, and
the mother kind of in

00:46:25.010 --> 00:46:26.980
between these worlds, right.

00:46:26.980 --> 00:46:31.200
In some ways, the whole
process is there.

00:46:31.200 --> 00:46:35.310
Actually the mother of this picture
was born in the Panama Canal zone.

00:46:35.310 --> 00:46:38.750
Her parents were operating
a funda there.

00:46:40.920 --> 00:46:45.190
Lovely portraits of these
children assimilating.

00:46:46.260 --> 00:46:48.950
That's Dan Albert, Daniel Albert.

00:46:48.950 --> 00:46:53.240
Born in 1930, his parents
didn't allow him

00:46:53.240 --> 00:46:57.240
to play American sports during
the early years of his life

00:46:57.240 --> 00:46:58.830
because they were going
to go back to Spain.

00:46:58.830 --> 00:47:02.980
You couldn't play that
barbaric version of football

00:47:02.980 --> 00:47:05.530
and get hurt, and not
be able to work.

00:47:05.530 --> 00:47:09.740
By 1940, he was trying
out for the football team

00:47:09.740 --> 00:47:11.450
and became captain
of the football team.

00:47:11.450 --> 00:47:14.140 position:56%
And had this -- and eventually coach

00:47:14.140 --> 00:47:17.810
of the Monterey High
School football team.

00:47:17.810 --> 00:47:20.610
And here's his mother's
Naturalization Certificate

00:47:20.610 --> 00:47:22.910
from 1940.

00:47:24.740 --> 00:47:29.170
Spanish women studying in a kind
of business school in New York.

00:47:30.840 --> 00:47:35.990
This fellow, Uncle Bill Castro,
his claim to fame, in the 1930s,

00:47:35.990 --> 00:47:38.210
was his castanet playing.

00:47:38.210 --> 00:47:41.940
And, in the 1940s, we see
him playing the drums.

00:47:41.940 --> 00:47:46.550
So a lovely graduation
picture from Tampa.

00:47:47.580 --> 00:47:50.780
And we come back to the
kind of where we started.

00:47:50.780 --> 00:47:54.670
This family from Castrillon,

00:47:54.670 --> 00:47:58.160
from Santa Maria del Mar,
all of whom immigrated.

00:47:58.160 --> 00:48:02.400
I think they had some other
children that also eventually came.

00:48:02.400 --> 00:48:07.800
And we jump forward 30 years and
see them here at a family gathering

00:48:07.800 --> 00:48:11.600
in 1934 in East Saint Louis.

00:48:11.600 --> 00:48:15.700
I don't know if you can see
the patriarchs are still there.

00:48:15.700 --> 00:48:20.190
The mother and father here,
here they are 30 years later.

00:48:20.190 --> 00:48:26.530 position:56%
Those children have now had children
and, in 1 case, the baby in the arms

00:48:26.530 --> 00:48:31.190
of the matriarch of the family
is the first great grandchild

00:48:31.190 --> 00:48:35.890 position:56%
of this clan who, I've just been
told, is the only person still alive

00:48:35.890 --> 00:48:38.490
of everyone in this picture.

00:48:38.490 --> 00:48:46.460
So I'll -- in closing, folks
like these and all the people

00:48:46.460 --> 00:48:51.610 position:56%
that we've been looking at, got into
this country just under the wire,

00:48:51.610 --> 00:48:56.280
in some ways, in that brief
window of time before Mr. Knutson

00:48:56.280 --> 00:48:59.120
and likeminded politicians
stopped the flow

00:48:59.120 --> 00:49:01.120
of these dangerous elements that,

00:49:01.120 --> 00:49:03.060
according the anti-immigration
lobbies,

00:49:03.060 --> 00:49:06.930
Spain and other countries were
dumping on the United States.

00:49:06.930 --> 00:49:10.360
The descendants of some of
these folks have become famous,

00:49:10.360 --> 00:49:14.220
like the actor, Martin Sheen,
the musician, Jerry Garcia,

00:49:14.220 --> 00:49:19.220
all the ballplayers, Al Lopez,
Lou Piniella and Tino Martinez.

00:49:19.220 --> 00:49:24.380 position:56%
But the vast majority, like the bulk
of a massive iceberg, led lives full

00:49:24.380 --> 00:49:29.490 position:56%
of solidarity, sacrifice and dignity
and became fully assimilated and,

00:49:29.490 --> 00:49:33.730
therefore, practically invisible
American citizens as teachers,

00:49:33.730 --> 00:49:37.400
doctors, homemakers, lawyers,
bakers, politicians, et cetera.

00:49:37.400 --> 00:49:40.410
And many of us are among you today.

00:49:40.410 --> 00:49:43.090
We've been fortunate enough to be
able to interview many children

00:49:43.090 --> 00:49:47.250
of the immigrants who are
now in their 80s and 90s.

00:49:47.250 --> 00:49:50.830
They are usually the keepers
of these precious archives

00:49:50.830 --> 00:49:53.420
and they are the ones who
possess the keys that we need

00:49:53.420 --> 00:49:56.280
to interpret family
documents and photographs.

00:49:56.280 --> 00:50:00.490
So, with each passing generation,
information gets a little sketchier

00:50:00.490 --> 00:50:03.700
and the photographs get a
little bit closer to being put

00:50:03.700 --> 00:50:10.360 position:56%
in the attic and, God help us, maybe
even someday disposed of, right?

00:50:10.360 --> 00:50:12.590
These people won't be
with us much longer

00:50:12.590 --> 00:50:16.450
which is what lends real urgency
to this project and to our task

00:50:16.450 --> 00:50:20.710
of rescuing the documentary legacy
of Spain's intrepid invisible --

00:50:20.710 --> 00:50:22.790
intrepid and invisible immigrants.

00:50:22.790 --> 00:50:24.590
Thank you.

00:50:24.590 --> 00:50:35.650
[ Applause ]

00:50:35.650 --> 00:50:36.950
&gt;&gt; Enrique Sarda Valls:
Thank you, James.

00:50:36.950 --> 00:50:38.250 position:56%
I'm going to address you some words,

00:50:38.250 --> 00:50:41.900
ladies and gentlemen,
better late than never.

00:50:41.900 --> 00:50:48.270
I met James earlier this
year and it was by chance.

00:50:48.270 --> 00:50:51.960
We were sitting together at
the [foreign language spoken],

00:50:51.960 --> 00:50:58.490
which is a gathering of Spanish
gentlemen and, only male generally,

00:50:58.490 --> 00:51:02.440
that will meet regularly every
month at [foreign language spoken]

00:51:02.440 --> 00:51:05.680
for chatting over lunch and coffee.

00:51:05.680 --> 00:51:08.850
And James was sitting next to me.

00:51:08.850 --> 00:51:11.960
I had just arrived
a few months before

00:51:11.960 --> 00:51:15.300
in Washington and hardly
knew anyone.

00:51:15.300 --> 00:51:19.360
And we start talking about this
and I was so fascinated by it

00:51:19.360 --> 00:51:24.440
from the first moment about
his project, that I said,

00:51:24.440 --> 00:51:29.420
you must come to the Consulate and
deliver a lecture on the subject.

00:51:29.420 --> 00:51:35.780
And, after I learned more about
it, my fascination increased,

00:51:35.780 --> 00:51:44.580
particularly when I knew that it
was crowdfunding was the method

00:51:44.580 --> 00:51:49.630
to gather the monies to
carry out the project.

00:51:49.630 --> 00:51:57.640
And also the thing that to
resort to private family archives

00:51:57.640 --> 00:52:01.110
to reconstruct the history
of the Spanish immigration

00:52:01.110 --> 00:52:08.080
to this country was a matter
of big, big interest for me.

00:52:08.080 --> 00:52:15.080
James held this lecture at the
Consulate in February, I recall,

00:52:15.080 --> 00:52:17.170
it was an enormous success.

00:52:17.170 --> 00:52:21.130
And ever since, I was so
enthusiastic about his work

00:52:21.130 --> 00:52:28.900
that I tried to promote it with my
web pages, with my Facebook and,

00:52:28.900 --> 00:52:32.680
when he offered me to come here
today, I immediately accepted.

00:52:32.680 --> 00:52:34.460
It's a great pleasure to
be with you and to share

00:52:34.460 --> 00:52:39.030
with you this deeply
moving human experience.

00:52:39.030 --> 00:52:43.650
As a human, as a Spanish
Consul General,

00:52:43.650 --> 00:52:49.910
and 36 years of career behind me,
I had the opportunity of dealing

00:52:49.910 --> 00:52:52.170
with a lot of immigrants.

00:52:52.170 --> 00:52:57.140
And these photos that we have
seen here today are the photos

00:52:57.140 --> 00:53:02.330
that any Spanish family could have
in its album, in their albums.

00:53:02.330 --> 00:53:04.340
And my family will
find photos like that,

00:53:04.340 --> 00:53:09.030
of course I am already a little
bit rather old, I'm 63 years old.

00:53:09.030 --> 00:53:12.650
But they're style of my
childhood, until in Spain

00:53:12.650 --> 00:53:15.010
in the 1960s was exactly the one

00:53:15.010 --> 00:53:17.820
that we can see on
these photographs.

00:53:17.820 --> 00:53:24.920
So it has been, for me, a
very, very moving experience.

00:53:24.920 --> 00:53:29.900
It is interesting, at this
point, to make a difference

00:53:29.900 --> 00:53:32.730
when what is our immigration
today to the United States

00:53:32.730 --> 00:53:35.950
and what was the traditional
immigration.

00:53:37.740 --> 00:53:42.270
Today, we have, nowadays, we have
a Spanish brand new immigration

00:53:42.270 --> 00:53:46.710
to United States which started
more or less after the first years

00:53:46.710 --> 00:53:49.970
of the crisis, the big,
the big crisis in Spain.

00:53:49.970 --> 00:53:52.980
And it has nothing to
do with this kind of,

00:53:52.980 --> 00:53:58.080 position:56%
with was our traditional immigration
or which was the immigration

00:53:58.080 --> 00:54:02.660
that help Spain to
develop in the '60s.

00:54:02.660 --> 00:54:05.400
This was a manpower
immigration, labor.

00:54:05.400 --> 00:54:10.730
And the immigration we have
today is what is called,

00:54:10.730 --> 00:54:13.570
has been called talent immigration.

00:54:13.570 --> 00:54:18.840
And it is fascinating to establish
the difference between these kinds

00:54:18.840 --> 00:54:27.100
that translates the progress
and [inaudible] by my country.

00:54:27.100 --> 00:54:32.840
I am very, very proud of it and,
because Spain has been contributing

00:54:32.840 --> 00:54:39.380 position:56%
to the United States in the past and
now according to its possibilities.

00:54:39.380 --> 00:54:46.270
And when I talk about the
actual, the present immigration

00:54:46.270 --> 00:54:52.440
to the United States, I see that
it is the fruit of 2 generations

00:54:52.440 --> 00:54:56.860
at least of families that have
done everything for their children,

00:54:56.860 --> 00:54:59.900
to provide their children for
a higher degree of education.

00:54:59.900 --> 00:55:04.050
And, I must say, to the
United States come the best

00:55:04.050 --> 00:55:05.910
of our brains nowaday.

00:55:05.910 --> 00:55:08.260
And I don't think that's
[inaudible] that is

00:55:08.260 --> 00:55:11.120
to deprive [inaudible]
country of its own talent.

00:55:11.120 --> 00:55:14.890
On the contrary, now these
people are going to return,

00:55:14.890 --> 00:55:18.070
most of them eventually, to
Spain and they're going to return

00:55:18.070 --> 00:55:20.650
with the -- we're going to
return with the experiences

00:55:20.650 --> 00:55:25.850
with our networks, with our
contacts, and our new knowledge

00:55:25.850 --> 00:55:29.870
and that will enormously enriching
for my country and from Europe.

00:55:29.870 --> 00:55:36.920
And I always say that Spain has
a role to play in this country

00:55:36.920 --> 00:55:40.880
in the Latin or Hispanic
collective because, myself,

00:55:40.880 --> 00:55:44.580 position:56%
I consider myself here in the United
States like a Latino or Hispanic

00:55:44.580 --> 00:55:47.770
from Spain, like someone
would be Latino,

00:55:47.770 --> 00:55:50.000
Hispanic from Venezuela or Cuba.

00:55:50.000 --> 00:55:52.670
And I think that we have
definitely a role still

00:55:52.670 --> 00:55:54.550
to play here in this country.

00:55:54.550 --> 00:55:58.020
And I'm very, very optimistic
about what's going on nowadays.

00:55:58.020 --> 00:56:02.560
Thank you very much for having
come today and thank you to you,

00:56:02.560 --> 00:56:05.510
James, for your admirable work.
