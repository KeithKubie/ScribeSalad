1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,360
So I think it'd be fair to point out,
you know, like youtube criticism too,

2
00:00:03,420 --> 00:00:05,040
because in talking about censorship,

3
00:00:05,280 --> 00:00:08,550
I think a lot of people
immediately assumed I'd come
on here and start waving my

4
00:00:08,551 --> 00:00:10,530
arms and they're screaming,
they're biased against conservatives,

5
00:00:10,531 --> 00:00:15,510
which I think 27 I kind of did. But
Youtube is, is, is, is a bit different.

6
00:00:15,870 --> 00:00:16,890
Youtube does,

7
00:00:17,070 --> 00:00:21,480
it has demonetized LGBT content and
Youtube has said that these topics are not

8
00:00:21,481 --> 00:00:23,640
suitable for all advertisers
because it deals with sexuality.

9
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,070
They have target many left wing channels,

10
00:00:26,340 --> 00:00:29,700
there are a lot of non mainstream
left wing, you know, outlets.

11
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:30,660
And when you say target,

12
00:00:30,661 --> 00:00:34,200
which means D monetize demonetize
the war sometimes outright ban.

13
00:00:34,260 --> 00:00:39,180
And I think then for d monetizing, I think
they've made a state what was the, uh,

14
00:00:39,181 --> 00:00:42,420
the policy there. It's essentially
things that are political correct.

15
00:00:43,410 --> 00:00:45,510
If they made that statement, I have
to run another thing I was gonna say,

16
00:00:45,660 --> 00:00:48,660
I was going to interject that
they've also been, are not banned,

17
00:00:48,661 --> 00:00:52,670
but do monetize people are extensively
people that smoke weed on their channel.

18
00:00:52,700 --> 00:00:57,060
Yeah, totally. Actually certain video game
channels that have for unknown reasons,

19
00:00:57,061 --> 00:00:59,100
just stopped having
monetization on their channel.

20
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:03,600
And that is the problem of ultimately
them having this incredible power where

21
00:01:03,830 --> 00:01:05,550
they, they really, there's no,

22
00:01:05,551 --> 00:01:09,240
there's not real open competition
in terms of like another,

23
00:01:10,380 --> 00:01:14,580
like a parallel competitor.
I don't think there will be real but,

24
00:01:14,630 --> 00:01:18,630
but here's the thing, I, I think you
took out a bunch of really bad things.

25
00:01:18,870 --> 00:01:23,010
I'm going to give a a very important
shout out to Monkey Jones who was wrongly

26
00:01:23,011 --> 00:01:27,940
terminated from youtube for highly
dubious reasons. He is a dark, dark,

27
00:01:28,180 --> 00:01:30,720
dark comic.
He had hundreds of thousands of followers.

28
00:01:31,140 --> 00:01:35,070
He made jokes about things like
school shootings, very dark stuff,

29
00:01:35,460 --> 00:01:38,580
but it was clearly mocking some of these
people. He was mocking Elliot Roger,

30
00:01:38,770 --> 00:01:41,070
he was making jokes about it and in fact,

31
00:01:41,130 --> 00:01:44,010
some of his videos were approved
manually for monetization,

32
00:01:44,430 --> 00:01:47,490
but for some reason youtube just
wiped them out one day gone.

33
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,140
So I set up a new channel and said, okay,
you know, we're not gonna do that anyway.

34
00:01:51,150 --> 00:01:54,240
It doesn't matter. They got rid of
him, he's effectively off of Youtube.

35
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:59,190
And he was like, he's a well known,
funny guy. He wasn't breaking the rules,

36
00:01:59,220 --> 00:02:01,200
he wasn't, but they still
deleted, deleted this channel.

37
00:02:01,710 --> 00:02:05,430
So I bring him up because I
think it's worrisome that yes,

38
00:02:05,460 --> 00:02:09,180
without an alternative, you're career is
wiped out in a second with no recourse.

39
00:02:09,181 --> 00:02:13,250
And no reason why. And the response they
give you is, it's our platform. Yeah.

40
00:02:13,320 --> 00:02:15,090
And you'll hear people say, oh,
but there are private business.

41
00:02:15,091 --> 00:02:16,980
They can do what they want.
Sure. But they're a monopoly.

42
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:18,510
We've got to have restrictions on that.
