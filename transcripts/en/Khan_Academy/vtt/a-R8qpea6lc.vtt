00:00:00.610 --> 00:00:04.290
When Japan faced its own banking
and debt crisis in the 1990s,

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:05.790
the first thing it
did is it started

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:09.450
to lower its target
interest rate or the rate

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:11.880
that banks borrow
reserves from each other.

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:13.820
And the way to do that
is you print money.

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:17.300
In the case of Japan, the
central break prints yen.

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:19.250
It buys short-term
government securities.

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:22.160
But the byproduct of that
is it increases the amount

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:25.190
of currency or reserves
in circulation.

00:00:25.190 --> 00:00:27.650
All banks have more reserves.

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:29.890
So the demand for that
reserves will go down

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:32.479
or the cost of borrowing
it will go down.

00:00:32.479 --> 00:00:35.050
And so it lowers
the interest rate.

00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:36.910
But Japan did that
enough so that it

00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:38.674
got to a 0% interest rate.

00:00:38.674 --> 00:00:40.840
But then it really couldn't
lower that interest rate

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:41.340
anymore.

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:42.990
And that's exactly
what Bernanke is

00:00:42.990 --> 00:00:45.340
faced with the US credit crisis.

00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:47.450
So the next thing
that Japan said is OK,

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:50.380
we still want more money
to enter into circulation.

00:00:50.380 --> 00:00:54.460
So we're going to keep
printing more yen.

00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:56.340
We're going to keep
printing more yen.

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:58.650
But since it's
really of no use just

00:00:58.650 --> 00:01:00.299
to buy the short-term
debt anymore

00:01:00.299 --> 00:01:02.840
because we've already kind of
priced those as high as we can.

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:04.599
We've lowered short-term
interest rates

00:01:04.599 --> 00:01:06.250
as much as possible.

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:09.070
Let's use this stuff
to buy other things.

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:10.860
Let's just get this
money into circulation

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:12.390
any which way we can.

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:15.790
So let's by long-term
Japanese treasuries.

00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:18.346
Let's buy corporate debt.

00:01:18.346 --> 00:01:19.720
So they did buy
a bunch of stuff,

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:21.470
but their intention
was literally just

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:26.890
to increase the
quantity of money.

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:28.620
So what the Japanese
did was kind

00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:30.860
of pure quantitative easing.

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:32.760
They were trying to
print money at any cost

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:35.660
and let that money
go into circulation

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:37.130
in any which way possible.

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:39.430
And they would buy a
bunch of stuff to do it.

00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:41.710
What Bernanke's
doing mechanically

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:44.530
is not that different than
what the Japanese did.

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:47.452
He started off trying to lower
short-term interest rates so he

00:01:47.452 --> 00:01:48.785
would buy short-term securities.

00:01:48.785 --> 00:01:51.500
It would increase the amount
of reserves in circulation,

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:53.540
lower the overnight
borrowing rate,

00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:56.030
lower the federal funds rate.

00:01:56.030 --> 00:02:01.050
But when that went to 0%, so
they both hit this floor at 0%,

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:03.220
Bernanke is like,
well, how do I solve

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:05.110
the logjam in the
credit markets?

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:06.980
And Bernanke, just
like Japan, says,

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:08.919
well, I'm going to start
printing more money

00:02:08.919 --> 00:02:10.960
and I'm going to
use it to buy assets

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:13.280
that the Fed does not
traditionally buy.

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:15.920
And Japan did this as well.

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:18.910
The difference-- and this
is how a Bernanke explains

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:20.790
the difference-- is
he doesn't view this

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:23.970
as pure quantitative easing,
not because it's mechanically

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:26.880
different, because it really
is mechanically the same thing.

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:28.760
But he calls it credit easing.

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:31.500
And in his mind, the difference
between quantitative and credit

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:35.830
easing is the intent and where
you direct that extra money

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:37.890
that you've printed.

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:39.886
In Japan's case,
they printed money

00:02:39.886 --> 00:02:41.510
for the sake of
printing money and they

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:44.210
bought all of this stuff
just to get that money

00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:45.590
into circulation.

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:48.160
In Bernanke's case,
he is printing money.

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:50.110
He does want their
money in circulation,

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:52.800
but that's not the end that
he's trying to achieve.

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:56.390
The end is to increase
demand for some

00:02:56.390 --> 00:02:59.420
of these types of securities
where maybe there's a logjam.

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:01.750
So even though mechanically
they're the same,

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:03.770
Bernanke says this is
credit easing because I'm

00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:06.430
trying to fix a problem in
the commercial debt market,

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:09.290
or I'm trying to fix the problem
in the mortgage backed security

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:12.400
market, while Japan was
just trying to print money

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:15.020
for the sake of printing money.
