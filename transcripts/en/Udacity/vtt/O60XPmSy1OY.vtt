Okay and that's all I want to show you about in,

00:00:01.810 --> 00:00:03.570
inheritance, and in fact that is all I am going to

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:06.820
show you about templates. So just remember that templates are, a

00:00:06.820 --> 00:00:10.240
great way to separate different types of code. You can keep your

00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:14.970
HTML separate from your python for the purposes of this class,

00:00:14.970 --> 00:00:17.710
which will make your life a little bit easier I hope.

00:00:17.710 --> 00:00:20.670
At least your code a little more clean hm. Make more

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:22.450
readable code, better organized code is

00:00:22.450 --> 00:00:25.270
more readable. Make more secure websites.

00:00:25.270 --> 00:00:27.380
You know, if you use the autoscaping feature of Jinja

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:29.540
or other template new languages you dont have to worry so

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:34.080
much about putting, you know, insecure malicious data into your website.

00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:36.230
And finally, you know, you have HTML that's much easier to

00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:39.180
modify. Instead of trying to manipulate strings in python you

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:43.430
have HTML in your HTML editor. It's much easier to manipulate.

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:46.750
So if you want to learn more about Jinja you can go

00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:50.630
to this URL, to learn more. And the slots of documentation

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:53.150
here and there's all sorts of nice little escapes

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:57.630
and filters and convenience things that can make the templates

00:00:57.630 --> 00:01:00.270
more and more powerful. So thanks for listening so

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:02.270
far and I hope this helps you in the future.
