00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:08.470
Introduction

00:00:08.470 --> 00:00:12.300
Everyone dreams of making it big in Hollywood,
but it’s an extremely cutthroat business.

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:16.270
It takes a lot of work to get up to the top,
and the slightest misstep can ruin a career

00:00:16.270 --> 00:00:17.370
instantly.

00:00:17.370 --> 00:00:22.220
The film industry is full of hungry, talented
people looking for work, and someone praised

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:26.029
as the next major star could be yesterday’s
news in the blink of an eye.

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:28.800
It happens to even the most famous faces in
the movies.

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:32.800
No matter how many accolades one scores, the
fall from grace can always be right around

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:33.800
the corner.

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:37.010
Here are 10 famous actors that have disappeared
from Hollywood.

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:39.120
Seann William Scott

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:43.410
After making audiences laugh as Stifler in
American Pie, Scott became one of the biggest

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:44.650
names in comedy.

00:00:44.650 --> 00:00:48.110
Unfortunately, he was never able to find another
defining role.

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:52.080
Many of the projects he took following American
Pie were critical duds and failed at the box

00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:54.750
office, causing studios to stay away from
him.

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:58.180
It also doesn’t help that Scott has never
been able to escape the shadow of Stifler

00:00:58.180 --> 00:01:03.150
and was typecast early on, meaning he never
truly expanded his horizons beyond the goofy

00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:04.150
party guy.

00:01:04.150 --> 00:01:07.820
He’s also not one to seek out publicity,
which has kept him out of the public eye for

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:09.400
a while.

00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:10.400
Cameron Diaz

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:14.810
In the late 90s and early 2000s, Diaz was
Hollywood’s hottest starlet, winning our

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:16.640
hearts in There’s Something About Mary.

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:20.710
After a short winning streak that included
a variety of projects, Diaz’s career took

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:24.260
a wrong turn and she had trouble replicating
her earlier success.

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:29.080
As her career has gone on, Diaz has starred
in a number of poorly received R-rated comedies,

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:31.280
including Bad Teacher and Sex Tape.

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:35.520
Even working with respected director Ridley
Scott on The Counselor didn’t turn out well.

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:39.729
It’s unlikely she’ll headline any major
movies nowadays with a string of bombs spoiling

00:01:39.729 --> 00:01:44.710
her résumé.

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:45.710
Taylor Lautner

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:50.310
Emerging as a heartthrob due to his role as
Jacob in the Twilight franchise, Taylor Lautner

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:52.860
seemed to have a nice career laid out for
himself.

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:56.600
But once the Twilight saga ended, so did Lautner’s
time in the spotlight.

00:01:56.600 --> 00:02:00.240
He hasn’t starred in much since he wrapped
up his work on the young adult series, and

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:04.150
the few vehicles he has been a part of, like
Abduction, have failed miserably.

00:02:04.150 --> 00:02:08.350
Allegedly, Lautner also demands very high
salaries for jobs and was turned down for

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:12.920
both Stretch Armstrong and David and Goliath
because of his outlandish price tags.

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:16.520
The good news for him is that he’s still
young, but nobody’s exactly knocking down

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:18.030
his door.

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:19.030
Adam Sandler

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:22.730
Sandler’s fall from the A-list has been
well-documented by now, and even some of his

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:25.200
biggest fans are left wondering what happened.

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:29.290
As time went on, Sandler became more concerned
with aspects like product placement and working

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:33.360
in cameos for his friends rather than making
a funny, entertaining movie.

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:37.310
Things reached a boiling point with Jack and
Jill, considered one of the worst films ever

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:39.489
made.

00:02:39.489 --> 00:02:45.730
Today, Sandler’s latest projects aren’t
even shown in theaters.

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:47.790
They’re directly released to Netflix.

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:51.860
The streaming service is wildly popular, but
this probably isn’t how Sandler envisioned

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:57.950
his career winding down.

00:02:57.950 --> 00:02:58.950
Eddie Murphy

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:03.760
Arguably the funniest man on the planet in
the 1980s, Murphy has one of the most frustrating

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:05.540
career trajectories of all-time.

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:10.200
The former Beverly Hills Cop and Nutty Professor
has had difficulties recapturing his earlier

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:15.060
glories, in large part due to a string of
flops including Pluto Nash, Norbit, and A

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:16.129
Thousand Words.

00:03:16.129 --> 00:03:20.090
He hasn’t been part of a major feature film
in four years, and that time away from the

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:22.540
limelight isn’t going to make things any
easier.

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:27.069
At least he has Shrek 5 to look forward to,
considering DreamWorks brings back his Donkey

00:03:27.069 --> 00:03:28.069
character.

00:03:28.069 --> 00:03:29.069
That should be a nice payday.

00:03:29.069 --> 00:03:30.069
Tobey Maguire

00:03:30.069 --> 00:03:31.069
He helped usher in the Golden Age of the superhero
movie with his work on the Spider-Man trilogy,

00:03:31.069 --> 00:03:32.069
but Tobey Maguire is hardly swinging high
through the streets of New York these days.

00:03:32.069 --> 00:03:33.069
Since that series ended in 2007, Maguire has
acted in only five films.

00:03:33.069 --> 00:03:34.069
He did receive a Golden Globe nomination for
his performance in 2009’s Brothers, but

00:03:34.069 --> 00:03:35.069
it’s hard to call him a true movie star
now.

00:03:35.069 --> 00:03:36.069
Many point to Maguire never growing out of
his boyish charm, as he didn’t sign on for

00:03:36.069 --> 00:03:37.069
any gritty roles.

00:03:37.069 --> 00:03:38.069
As he got older, that made him appear less
convincing.

00:03:38.069 --> 00:03:39.069
Maguire has also settled down with a family,
so he may not want to dive back into the Hollywood

00:03:39.069 --> 00:03:40.069
craziness.

00:03:40.069 --> 00:03:41.069
Katherine Heigel

00:03:41.069 --> 00:03:42.069
It wasn’t that long ago Katherine Heigel
had one of the more promising careers in the

00:03:42.069 --> 00:03:43.069
industry.

00:03:43.069 --> 00:03:44.069
Knocked Up was a huge comedy hit, and she
won an Emmy for her role on Grey’s Anatomy.

00:03:44.069 --> 00:03:45.069
Then, the wheels came off.

00:03:45.069 --> 00:03:48.270
After being nominated for the Emmy in 2008,
Heigel withdrew her name, saying she felt

00:03:48.270 --> 00:03:51.450
her performance during that season wasn’t
worth the recognition.

00:03:51.450 --> 00:03:54.849
She was then written out of the show, and
her movie offers have become limited.

00:03:54.849 --> 00:03:59.230
Heigel has a reputation for biting the hand
that feeds, even criticizing Knocked Up for

00:03:59.230 --> 00:04:00.230
being sexist.

00:04:00.230 --> 00:04:05.900
Her chances of a comeback are probably dead.

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:07.050
Brendan Fraser

00:04:07.050 --> 00:04:11.310
Making a name for himself as the star of the
Mummy franchise, Fraser wasn’t able to keep

00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:13.610
the hits rolling as his career chugged along.

00:04:13.610 --> 00:04:17.810
His successes were always offset by some odd
choices, and eventually the bad films caught

00:04:17.810 --> 00:04:18.810
up with him.

00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:21.989
He found a surprise blockbuster in Journey
to the Center of the Earth, but due to his

00:04:21.989 --> 00:04:25.500
demands to hold off on the sequel, he was
replaced by the Rock.

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:28.020
You can probably guess how that worked for
Fraser.

00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:31.550
His most recent projects have been flops,
and now he’s nowhere to be seen.

00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:36.180
With the Mummy being rebooted with Tom Cruise,
Fraser can’t even go back to that well.

00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:37.570
Hayden Christensen

00:04:37.570 --> 00:04:42.110
As Harrison Ford, Daisy Ridley, and John Boyega
can tell you, starring in a Star Wars film

00:04:42.110 --> 00:04:44.270
is an easy ticket to superstardom.

00:04:44.270 --> 00:04:49.020
Unfortunately for Hayden Christensen, his
time in a galaxy far, far away wasn’t as

00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:50.020
fruitful.

00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:53.460
Playing Anakin Skywalker in the final two
prequels, the actor was heavily criticized

00:04:53.460 --> 00:04:57.870
for his dull performances, part of which could
be blamed on clunky dialogue.

00:04:57.870 --> 00:05:01.630
Following Revenge of the Sith, he didn’t
have many high-profile offers and faded into

00:05:01.630 --> 00:05:02.630
obscurity.

00:05:02.630 --> 00:05:06.520
For his part, Christensen seems at peace with
his life and has even said he wouldn’t come

00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:08.540
back to Star Wars for a quick paycheck.

00:05:08.540 --> 00:05:12.530
His stepping down from the limelight seems
to be his choice.

00:05:12.530 --> 00:05:13.840
Catherine Zeta-Jones

00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:17.620
She was one of the biggest names in Hollywood
at the turn of the century, winning an Oscar

00:05:17.620 --> 00:05:22.310
for her role in Chicago and starring in hits
such as Ocean’s Twelve and America’s Sweethearts.

00:05:22.310 --> 00:05:24.770
But Jones couldn’t stay on top for much
longer.

00:05:24.770 --> 00:05:28.990
Some feel that personal issues, like her struggle
with bipolar disorder and marital problems

00:05:28.990 --> 00:05:31.270
were to blame, but Jones has another idea.

00:05:31.270 --> 00:05:35.150
She once spoke out about the lack of roles
for women in their 40s in Hollywood, bemoaning

00:05:35.150 --> 00:05:38.400
the fact that executives don’t find those
kinds of stories interesting.

00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:42.400
Jones does have a point there, and she probably
could still deliver a knockout performance

00:05:42.400 --> 00:06:18.699
if asked.

00:06:18.699 --> 00:06:21.310
Those are our picks for actors who have faded
from Hollywood.

00:06:21.310 --> 00:06:22.590
What do you think of our list?

00:06:22.590 --> 00:06:23.590
