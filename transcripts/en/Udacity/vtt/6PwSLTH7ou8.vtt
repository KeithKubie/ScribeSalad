00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:02.980
Once a mutation has been passed on then

00:00:02.980 --> 00:00:06.060
it can spread in the population. So from our

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:09.080
campsite example of the bear, once you survive

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:12.560
and once you produce, more importantly. That allele, that

00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:14.560
mutation can get passed on to the next

00:00:14.560 --> 00:00:18.300
generation. And the more kids you have the more

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:22.130
you can change the population frequency. So let's focus

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:25.710
on this one particular metric. Allele frequency. We need

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:27.660
some alleles to focus on, so let's go

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:31.460
back to our trusty lactase persistence alleles. We've

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:33.890
learned that there's a lactase persistence allele that's

00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:37.640
dominate. Plus here, and a lactase non-persistence allele that's

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:40.060
recessive here, minus. Now let's say I have

00:00:40.060 --> 00:00:44.480
a thousand people. 500 are homozygous dominant, 350

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:48.960
are heterozygous, and 150 are homozygous recessive. I

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:51.050
want you to tell me how many total alleles

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:54.450
there are in the population of a thousand people. Go ahead

00:00:54.450 --> 00:00:57.040
and enter your answer as a number in the box here.
