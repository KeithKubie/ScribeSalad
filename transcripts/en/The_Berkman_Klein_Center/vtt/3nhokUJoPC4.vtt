\b0 Colin: This is in some sense I guess we
met maybe a year -- about a year ago.\

00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:18.650

\cf0 Colin: Which seems like ever so very
long ago because we gathered group of people

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:25.890
who were thinking about accessibility from
a variety of different perspectives and her

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:31.990
resume was clearly the star of the show in
bringing a really unique and powerful perspective

00:00:31.990 --> 00:00:39.140
to our conversations and helping me -- absolutely
challenging the Berkman Center to do better

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:44.730
on issues of accessibility and accessing to
also not just to do better but to really rethink

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:54.020
our ideas about accessibility to technology,
to learn from universal design, to learn from

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:58.360
some of the other experiences that we've seen
in architecture, urban planning, design and

00:00:58.360 --> 00:00:59.360
about twenty five other disciplines. \
\pard\pardeftab720\li2160\sl240\sa200\qj\pardirnatural

00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:04.619
\cf0 She comes to us from Emory where she's
a Professor of Women's Studies and English

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:11.619
by way of Radcliffe down the road where she
has been a fellow this past year. But I think

00:01:11.619 --> 00:01:17.970
has a really powerful perspective on critical
but maybe she calls critical disability stage

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:23.280
as least that's how I think of it and being
most wonderfully critical but in a wonderfully

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:28.770
constructive way. And I think it's a really
important dialog for us to have and then continue

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:33.530
with and follow the dialog up with action.
So one of the reasons I'm so thrilled to have

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:38.370
all of the interns in this room for you is
because these are the ones who are going to

00:01:38.370 --> 00:01:45.120
be making that stuff happen. And so I am hopeful
and confident that you will infect them with

00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:51.930
your particular side of vision and that you
guys will challenge her in ways that shows

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:53.320
how much she really has to offer.\

\cf0 Rosemarie: Well, welcome and thank you

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:13.050
very much coming. Colin, thank you for this
opportunity and the invitation to be here

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:19.390
at the Berkman Center and to share the work
that I do in Critical Disability Studies which

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:25.310
we take, of course, the term from Critical
Ways Studies or sometimes we call our work

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:33.329
Cultural Disability Studies. So I'm here to
basically tell you and show you what an accessible

00:02:33.329 --> 00:02:39.550
world we live in right now at this moment
in this place and I'm going to emphasize the

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:46.041
idea of my title here
\i Expanding the Concept of Accessible Technology

00:02:46.041 --> 00:02:54.540
\i0 . I have a lot of images so that I can
show and tell at the same time and I'm going

00:02:54.540 --> 00:03:01.379
to try to go through them quickly in order
to be highly illustrative about the rather

00:03:01.379 --> 00:03:07.980
simple points that I want to make.\
\pard\pardeftab720\li2160\sl240\sa200\qj\pardirnatural

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:21.220
\cf0 This has a hair trigger.
\b [Laughter]

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:29.069
\b0 So my purpose today is to expand the idea
of accessible technology and to show you the

00:03:29.069 --> 00:03:37.760
way we make our shared world of buildings,
of technologies, of public spaces, practices,

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:46.249
laws, culture and attitude and how it builds
a total environment which welcomes some people

00:03:46.249 --> 00:03:53.579
and keeps other people out. So the talk is
going to present an evolution of how accessible

00:03:53.579 --> 00:04:01.430
-- technologies in the very broadest sense
make our citizenry more inclusive and diverse.

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:08.299
So the principle that I'm going to be illustrating
to you today is that accessible technology

00:04:08.299 --> 00:04:12.919
is everywhere once you know how to look for
it. \

00:04:12.919 --> 00:04:18.320
Okay. People with disabilities, of course,
have always use technology to participate

00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:24.240
in a world that's not built for them. For
most of history, of course, disabled people

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:30.250
out in public have been beggars. The figure
of the crippled or the blind beggar accessing

00:04:30.250 --> 00:04:37.610
public space with technology appears often
in such well-known artworks as the ones I'm

00:04:37.610 --> 00:04:46.060
showing you here, the 1525 painting by Pieter
Bruegel or this 1916 photograph of a blind

00:04:46.060 --> 00:04:49.520
beggar by the American photographer Paul Strand.
\

00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:50.520
\pard\pardeftab720\sl240\sa200\qj\pardirnatural

00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:51.520
\b \cf0 [0:05:06]\
\pard\pardeftab720\li2160\sl240\sa200\qj\pardirnatural

00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:57.390
\b0 \cf0 So these are disabled folks using
technology to access the public world. Disabled

00:04:57.390 --> 00:05:05.330
people participate in and contribute to the
world by using innovative technologies to

00:05:05.330 --> 00:05:11.139
bridge the gap between their distinctive ways
of being in the world and a material and a

00:05:11.139 --> 00:05:16.960
social environment that's built for standard
bodies but we sometimes call and I like this

00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:19.509
term a lot "majority bodies".
\b [Laughter]

00:05:19.509 --> 00:05:25.900
\b0 The writer and the intellectual Helen
Keller, for example, used a human interpreter

00:05:25.900 --> 00:05:31.620
to facilitate communication. She's a 1908
graduate of Radcliffe, by the way, whereas

00:05:31.620 --> 00:05:39.880
as the physicist Stephen Hawking uses a machine
for communication and mobility.\

00:05:39.880 --> 00:05:45.879
Most technology that human beings use exclude
people with disabilities because the designs

00:05:45.879 --> 00:05:54.189
are either inflexible or only support standard
bodies. In our contemporary moment, however,

00:05:54.189 --> 00:06:01.319
distinctive technologies designed to be used
by people with disabilities are emerging from

00:06:01.319 --> 00:06:07.539
the developed world. For instance, and I hope
you're all following this, double amputee

00:06:07.539 --> 00:06:15.919
Oscar Pistorius uses fibre-carbon prosthetic
legs made down the road here at MIT to compete

00:06:15.919 --> 00:06:23.020
against runners with fleshly legs and he is
trying to qualify to run in the Olympics,

00:06:23.020 --> 00:06:29.810
not the Paralympics and has until I think
three or four days to do it. \

00:06:29.810 --> 00:06:35.629
To suggest the expansion and the evolution
of an accessible technology, I'm going to

00:06:35.629 --> 00:06:43.500
lay out for you today as I suggested two opposing
kinds of what I call World Building. Both

00:06:43.500 --> 00:06:49.569
are material and historical initiatives that
shaped communities by determining who and

00:06:49.569 --> 00:07:00.539
who does not participate in these communities.
One of these is eugenic world building. The

00:07:00.539 --> 00:07:05.240
other is inclusive world building. And I'm
going to start with eugenic world building

00:07:05.240 --> 00:07:10.370
but I'm going to emphasize the inclusive world
building but I want to spend a little bit

00:07:10.370 --> 00:07:15.659
of time laying out a contrast here so that
you have a sense of the logic and the history

00:07:15.659 --> 00:07:23.590
of what I called eugenic world building. \
So eugenic world building was a progressive

00:07:23.590 --> 00:07:28.499
and this is important, initiative carried
out primarily in the first half of the 20th

00:07:28.499 --> 00:07:35.810
century worldwide but most fully in the developed
West that's because they had technology and

00:07:35.810 --> 00:07:45.249
delivered -- I'm sorry. That is intended to
shape a desired citizenry by producing more

00:07:45.249 --> 00:07:50.289
of the people that any given group considers
as valuable and by eliminating the people

00:07:50.289 --> 00:07:56.639
that are considered to inferior. So things
like Better Baby Contests and Fitter Family

00:07:56.639 --> 00:08:03.659
Competitions were common practices to define
and to show what a desired citizen might be

00:08:03.659 --> 00:08:10.870
like. These are examples this Better Baby
Contests of what is sometimes called positive

00:08:10.870 --> 00:08:17.090
eugenics. \
Negative eugenics was carried out, of course,

00:08:17.090 --> 00:08:22.099
at the same time through laws and medical
practices in the United States and elsewhere

00:08:22.099 --> 00:08:28.249
in the developed world through primarily forced
sterilization which happened extensively in

00:08:28.249 --> 00:08:36.150
the United States. The famous 1927 Supreme
Court decision authorized forcible sterilization.

00:08:36.150 --> 00:08:44.560
Supreme Court Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes
explained the logic of this negative eugenics

00:08:44.560 --> 00:08:51.830
policy by asserting quite famously the quote
"Three generations of imbeciles is enough."

00:08:51.830 --> 00:08:58.340
\
Nazi Germany enacted, of course, the ultimate

00:08:58.340 --> 00:09:06.920
logic of negative eugenics beginning in September
1939 by rounding up and exterminating several

00:09:06.920 --> 00:09:12.140
hundred thousand disabled Germans who were
in institutions that range from orphanages

00:09:12.140 --> 00:09:17.870
to medical care facilities. They transferred
them to extermination facilities with the

00:09:17.870 --> 00:09:24.290
Nazi's in cooperation with medical practitioners
developed the gas chambers and the sham medical

00:09:24.290 --> 00:09:31.120
exams which were later used in a much more
ambitious Nazi project to exterminate the

00:09:31.120 --> 00:09:38.470
Jews of Europe and other groups who were considered
to be eugenically inferior. \

00:09:38.470 --> 00:09:47.670
Today, across the developed world, reproductive
technologies carry out a kind of negative

00:09:47.670 --> 00:09:54.200
eugenics aimed at eliminating disability and
people born with disabilities under the logic

00:09:54.200 --> 00:09:58.850
of individual choice and we might want to
think a little bit about the more recent development

00:09:58.850 --> 00:10:04.200
of the population imbalance that's taking
place in developing countries as a result

00:10:04.200 --> 00:10:10.030
of sex selection abortion which is in some
sense the eugenic undertaking.\

\pard\pardeftab720\sl240\sa200\qj\pardirnatural

\pard\pardeftab720\li2160\sl240\sa200\qj\pardirnatural

00:10:12.030 --> 00:10:16.530
\b0 \cf0 Princeton philosopher Peter Singer
advocates that the disable newborns should

00:10:16.530 --> 00:10:23.240
be euthanized on the basis of parental discretion
and there's a quote here by Peter Singer "We

00:10:23.240 --> 00:10:29.870
think that some infants with severe disabilities
should be killed." And he holds to that philosophical

00:10:29.870 --> 00:10:36.470
position to this day. \
Now, for a cheerier topic

00:10:36.470 --> 00:10:40.650
\b [Laughter]
\b0 , what I'm calling inclusive world building

00:10:40.650 --> 00:10:47.040
is a way of thinking which strives to make
a world in which a diverse range of human

00:10:47.040 --> 00:10:58.080
beings can use effectively and participate
fully. Inclusive world building is a set of

00:10:58.080 --> 00:11:04.010
legal and material practices born of the civil
and the human rights movement of the mid 20th

00:11:04.010 --> 00:11:10.600
century that changed the composition of the
citizenry who could fully participate in all

00:11:10.600 --> 00:11:18.260
aspects of civil life and some of this legislation
you are aware of is in constant the Americans

00:11:18.260 --> 00:11:25.360
with Disabilities Act of 1990 and 2009 as
well as the worldwide United Nations Treaty

00:11:25.360 --> 00:11:32.480
and the Rights of People with Disabilities
which was enacted in 2008.\

00:11:32.480 --> 00:11:39.390
For the rest of my time today, I'm going to
present you aspects of inclusive world building

00:11:39.390 --> 00:11:45.000
developed and enacted as a direct result of
the legal and the material initiatives that

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:51.370
developed that with the human and civil rights
movement. Inclusive design is a guiding principle

00:11:51.370 --> 00:11:57.950
of world building that has transformed the
built environment by allowing a wide diversity

00:11:57.950 --> 00:12:07.080
of citizens previously excluded to enter in
to and use the world that we have built together

00:12:07.080 --> 00:12:14.830
and that we share in order for them to use
and to exercise the privileges and the obligations

00:12:14.830 --> 00:12:22.320
of a democratic citizenship, so inclusive
design. \

00:12:22.320 --> 00:12:28.380
What I'm calling inclusive design is a principle
of world making as express through a variety

00:12:28.380 --> 00:12:34.471
of terms some of which you might be familiar
with, inclusive design, design for all, universal

00:12:34.471 --> 00:12:40.580
design, human-centered design, barrier-free
design. One definition that I like to put

00:12:40.580 --> 00:12:48.160
forward that I've developed is inclusive design
is human-centered design of everything with

00:12:48.160 --> 00:12:55.940
everyone in mind and I'm going to try to show
you some examples. I want to take a moment

00:12:55.940 --> 00:13:02.720
to call attention to the Iconography of Inclusive
World Building. As a way to kind of gestured

00:13:02.720 --> 00:13:11.050
to the varying solutions that human communities
have developed to extend the opportunity to

00:13:11.050 --> 00:13:18.970
ex -- previously excluded citizens to participate
in civic life. So the international symbol

00:13:18.970 --> 00:13:28.450
of access I love this because it's both an
icon and a sign as well a material technology

00:13:28.450 --> 00:13:35.680
of accessibility that calls the attention
to the accessible features of the built environment

00:13:35.680 --> 00:13:42.060
that actually tend to go unnoticed because
we routinary use them. So these various icons

00:13:42.060 --> 00:13:48.920
that I'm going to scroll through very quickly
become signs in both senses of the world of

00:13:48.920 --> 00:14:02.390
an accessible environment for us, all of us,
to notice and to use collectively. \

00:14:02.390 --> 00:14:10.790
So the sign for way finding for people with
low vision or anyone, for us way finding challenges?

00:14:10.790 --> 00:14:19.170
The sign language interpretation which I think
is a particularly elegant symbol. Volume control

00:14:19.170 --> 00:14:29.310
telephone symbol here provides accessibility
in communication, of course, family restrooms

00:14:29.310 --> 00:14:34.030
which have transformed life for all of us.
\b [Laughter]

00:14:34.030 --> 00:14:38.940
\b0 Single-use restrooms allow a variety of
different people including, and this is really

00:14:38.940 --> 00:14:44.400
interesting recently, transsexual people to
appropriately use restrooms. \

\b [Laughter]

00:14:48.430 --> 00:14:51.530
\b0 I call this renegade access symbols
\b [Laughter]

00:14:51.530 --> 00:14:57.410
\b0 that are what I call the cloud source
iconography of access that has emerged from

00:14:57.410 --> 00:15:06.230
the bottom up. This is on the left, a -- an
initiative undertaken by actually someone

00:15:06.230 --> 00:15:18.350
in the room here to promote a redesigned more
agentic as it were symbol of accessibility

00:15:18.350 --> 00:15:25.260
and to overlay that on the more aesthetic
symbol that that has been developed. And then

00:15:25.260 --> 00:15:30.680
my favorite one, I didn't even know where
this came from is it's a directional icon

00:15:30.680 --> 00:15:33.860
for disabled sex
\b [Laughter]

00:15:33.860 --> 00:15:43.310
\b0 which is important, another really quite
wonderful sexuality-oriented piece of iconography.\

00:15:43.310 --> 00:15:52.200
Okay. I want to go through a number of images
that are illustrative of inclusive world building

00:15:52.200 --> 00:15:59.120
at work to call your attention to some of
these features that we all experience and

00:15:59.120 --> 00:16:07.560
use often times without realizing that we
are accessing technologies that make the world

00:16:07.560 --> 00:16:15.810
more diverse for all of us. So before I do
that, I have a list here as well as some illustrations

00:16:15.810 --> 00:16:20.750
of the principles of universal design if you
wish to take a look at those. They are a little

00:16:20.750 --> 00:16:28.350
bit hard understand but it's worth investigating
at later, equitable used, flexibility in use,

00:16:28.350 --> 00:16:34.480
simple and intuitive, perceptible information,
low tolerant or tolerance for error, low aesthetical

00:16:34.480 --> 00:16:41.940
effort, size and space. I don't know why the
force in there. Approach and use -- I use

00:16:41.940 --> 00:16:47.980
dictations that -- technology which has the
really funny little ticks and also some hilarious

00:16:47.980 --> 00:16:54.110
things. My favorite one is that sometimes
when I say to my technology accessible, it

00:16:54.110 --> 00:16:59.330
comes out E-X-C-E-S-S-I-V-E, new word, B-U-L-L.
\b [Laughter]

00:16:59.330 --> 00:17:00.330
\b0 Excessivebull.
\b [Laughter]\

00:17:00.330 --> 00:17:01.330
\pard\pardeftab720\sl240\sa200\qj\pardirnatural

00:17:01.330 --> 00:17:02.330
\b0 \cf0 Male 1: Do you say that's not it?
\b [Laughter]\

00:17:02.330 --> 00:17:06.360
\b0 Rosemarie: Absolutely.\
Male 1: It\'92s been in there. It's very high-tech.\

00:17:06.360 --> 00:17:11.329
\pard\pardeftab720\li2160\fi-2160\sl240\sa200\qj\pardirnatural
\cf0 Rosemarie: That's exactly right. So the

00:17:11.329 --> 00:17:20.500
drinking fountain at multiple heights, the
push buttons that allows doors to open for

00:17:20.500 --> 00:17:29.630
people who use wheelchairs or are carrying
lots of packages or children or anything else.

00:17:29.630 --> 00:17:35.850
So ease of manipulation is important. The
universal leather handle doors instead of

00:17:35.850 --> 00:17:43.540
the round doorknobs provide universal accessibility
to everyone. It's an elegant example and they

00:17:43.540 --> 00:17:51.630
are also beautiful. Threshold-free access,
long ramps and curb cuts and you're seeing

00:17:51.630 --> 00:17:57.020
illustrations and I'll talk a little bit more
about that, varying kinds of wheels mobility.

00:17:57.020 --> 00:18:05.070
We have some elegant designs that have evolved
for wheelchair usage. For example, in airports,

00:18:05.070 --> 00:18:12.550
you are seeing more and more and more people
using wheelchairs to navigate the long distances

00:18:12.550 --> 00:18:16.880
that are required to travel in our mega airports
these days. \

00:18:16.880 --> 00:18:21.050
\pard\pardeftab720\li2160\sl240\sa200\qj\pardirnatural
\cf0 There are also walkers that are particularly

00:18:21.050 --> 00:18:32.150
elegant and useful kinds of accessible mobility,
accessible technology. Multiple usage wheel

00:18:32.150 --> 00:18:41.100
to access -- I talk a lot about the invention
of wheeled luggage which occurred contemporaneously

00:18:41.100 --> 00:18:47.870
with the changes in the built environment
to ramp it so that we are able now to have

00:18:47.870 --> 00:18:53.710
those all-terrain vehicle strollers for a
parents to be able to access public transportation

00:18:53.710 --> 00:18:58.150
and spaces that they were kept out of before
as well as wheeled luggage which is perhaps

00:18:58.150 --> 00:19:05.450
one of the most universal of all technologies.
I like this concept accessible sanitary system.

00:19:05.450 --> 00:19:10.290
These are particularly elegant design solutions.
\

00:19:10.290 --> 00:19:16.590
Architectural elegance, of course, we know
this now that the legislation in the US and

00:19:16.590 --> 00:19:22.260
elsewhere has been underway for about thirty
years or more, architecture beginning to develop

00:19:22.260 --> 00:19:28.420
some beautiful and elegant solution besides
simply shoving an ugly ramp on the front of

00:19:28.420 --> 00:19:36.610
an old building. And here some examples, there's
often a conflict between preserving historical

00:19:36.610 --> 00:19:41.800
integrity and creating access but architects
and designers are beginning to come up with,

00:19:41.800 --> 00:19:44.990
again, elegant and an effective solutions
for this.\

00:19:44.990 --> 00:19:45.990
\pard\pardeftab720\sl240\sa200\qj\pardirnatural

00:19:45.990 --> 00:19:46.990
\b \cf0 [0:20:01]\
\pard\pardeftab720\li2160\sl240\sa200\qj\pardirnatural

00:19:46.990 --> 00:19:51.330
\b0 \cf0 This is a cathedral with a really
lovely ramp. Accessible transportations systems,

00:19:51.330 --> 00:19:58.200
I'd like to focus on a little bit in a sense
that in a democratic capitalist order one

00:19:58.200 --> 00:20:05.820
of the most aspects of this, the world we
live in now is mobility in every sense and

00:20:05.820 --> 00:20:10.960
the transportation is the key to mobility
in every sense. So accessible transportation

00:20:10.960 --> 00:20:19.710
systems such as the DC Metro offer wide variety
of access. I love this particular illustration.

00:20:19.710 --> 00:20:26.020
This is a woman getting on an accessible piece
of transportation with her service honny [0:20:42]

00:20:26.020 --> 00:20:27.720
[Phonetic].
\b [Laughter]

00:20:27.720 --> 00:20:32.240
\b0 \
We have brailed information services in public

00:20:32.240 --> 00:20:40.100
places and in accessible transportation. Service
animals of course have access to -- public

00:20:40.100 --> 00:20:47.790
transportation. Cane navigation is facilitated
by technologies and public transportation

00:20:47.790 --> 00:20:54.820
elsewhere. Multiple vertical transportation
modes exist in most public transportation;

00:20:54.820 --> 00:21:03.060
elevators, escalators, stairs and climb paths.
Multiple linguistic access; English language

00:21:03.060 --> 00:21:08.401
signage, Spanish signage. This is from the
Washington DC Metro symbolic signage, universal

00:21:08.401 --> 00:21:14.680
signage and most interestingly what I call
non-literate signage which we often see. \

00:21:14.680 --> 00:21:23.060
Various stability aids are very important.
Here we have, of course, someone using stability

00:21:23.060 --> 00:21:33.620
aids in order to have an infant-carrying wheeled
device on a metro car. Train platform continuities

00:21:33.620 --> 00:21:40.500
are very important for wheel to access from
platform in to subway and train cars. I'll

00:21:40.500 --> 00:21:45.880
take a little bit more now about accessible
communication devices. If I had an hour and

00:21:45.880 --> 00:21:50.510
a half, I would go on and on about my love
affair with the iPhone and the iPad

00:21:50.510 --> 00:21:53.610
\b [Laughter]
\b0 , the newly accessible one which has changed

00:21:53.610 --> 00:21:59.840
my life and made it possible for me to do
work. I'll talk a little bit more about that.

00:21:59.840 --> 00:22:05.200
\
There are apps in the iPhone and the iPad

00:22:05.200 --> 00:22:08.530
that are universally accessible. You don't
have to download them separately. I think

00:22:08.530 --> 00:22:15.000
many of you know about this. You simply can
turn them on for a variety of different access

00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:23.120
features. There are apps that use amazing
kinds of, I don't know, programs. I'm never

00:22:23.120 --> 00:22:27.710
good at talking about this but for example,
allow people to communicate using sign language

00:22:27.710 --> 00:22:34.450
with FaceTime or there are some really interesting
apps. I don't know, again, how to use that.

00:22:34.450 --> 00:22:41.130
This is a picture of a woman with low vision
or blind who is using her iPhone to take pictures

00:22:41.130 --> 00:22:47.940
of cans and are covered and then somehow it
goes somewhere and somehow something tells

00:22:47.940 --> 00:22:59.030
her what's... there you go, what's in her
covered. Simple things, of course, like varying

00:22:59.030 --> 00:23:04.890
side text, enlargeable text, we know and use
these features often.\

00:23:04.890 --> 00:23:11.900
This is a picture of me using the iPhone and
the iPad technology which works really well

00:23:11.900 --> 00:23:17.510
for me. I don't have a very iconic disability.
I have a rather distinctive disability. Therefore,

00:23:17.510 --> 00:23:25.450
I have particular needs and the iPhone has
made it possible for me to text in a way that

00:23:25.450 --> 00:23:34.160
I couldn't possibly do before and has made
communicating and creating texts extremely

00:23:34.160 --> 00:23:38.340
accessible for me so that I can do my work
and be out and about in the world. \

00:23:38.340 --> 00:23:47.210
Okay. The last thing that I want to talk about
is perhaps most the -- the most counter intuitive

00:23:47.210 --> 00:23:57.760
and distinctive aspect of accessible technology
and that is what I call art and culture as

00:23:57.760 --> 00:24:04.680
a form of accessible technology. So the entry
of people with disabilities of course and

00:24:04.680 --> 00:24:10.220
other people that have been excluded previously
on the basis of category such as race and

00:24:10.220 --> 00:24:17.890
gender has given them access to social capital
such as education, employment, acculturation

00:24:17.890 --> 00:24:26.250
and social networks which has produced a flourishing
disability culture in which accessible technology

00:24:26.250 --> 00:24:32.840
is a crucial component and I'm going to try
to show you how accessible technology is implicated

00:24:32.840 --> 00:24:41.020
and fundamental to producing disability art
and culture. Okay, more recent popular television

00:24:41.020 --> 00:24:47.970
shows such as Glee introduced accessible technologies
and people with disabilities to add both hip

00:24:47.970 --> 00:24:51.840
diversity and cheerful theatricality to the
plots.\

00:24:51.840 --> 00:24:52.840
\pard\pardeftab720\sl240\sa200\qj\pardirnatural

00:24:52.840 --> 00:24:53.840
\b \cf0 [0:25:08]\
\pard\pardeftab720\li2160\sl240\sa200\qj\pardirnatural

00:24:53.840 --> 00:24:59.360
\b0 \cf0 So we have wheelchairs and actual
people with disabilities in such television

00:24:59.360 --> 00:25:08.180
shows as Glee. Civil rights lawyer and author
Harriet McBryde Johnson has engaged that philosopher

00:25:08.180 --> 00:25:15.620
Peter Singer in to a public debate in the
New York Times about his advocacy for euthanizing

00:25:15.620 --> 00:25:23.559
disabled newborns. So not only medical and
mechanical technology provided access to education

00:25:23.559 --> 00:25:30.260
and economic resources for people like Harriet
McBryde Johnson but communication technology

00:25:30.260 --> 00:25:37.850
put Johnson and her ideas before a wide general
public. \

00:25:37.850 --> 00:25:43.470
The photographer Kevin Connolly who was born
legless and travels the world on a low riding

00:25:43.470 --> 00:25:50.260
kind of skateboard that he prefers over a
wheelchair for mobility has reversed the photographic

00:25:50.260 --> 00:25:56.740
gaze that's established by artists such as
Diane Arbus by photographing thousands of

00:25:56.740 --> 00:26:03.309
people across the world that he has captured
looking at him. The distinctive angle of his

00:26:03.309 --> 00:26:09.580
camera and the surprise that he captures on
the faces and the postures of the people looking

00:26:09.580 --> 00:26:16.850
at him, turns back their looks upon them and
reveals their surprise at encountering such

00:26:16.850 --> 00:26:23.440
an unusual person out and about in the world
using the accessible world and accessible

00:26:23.440 --> 00:26:29.680
technology. You can go to his website and
see is 3,000 photographs.\

00:26:29.680 --> 00:26:34.720
The entry of disabled people in to the world
and the media has produce the cadre, I love

00:26:34.720 --> 00:26:41.600
this part, of disabled celebrities whose stories
and images range much beyond earlier disabled

00:26:41.600 --> 00:26:47.490
celebrities such as Helen Keller or even Stephen
Hawking. One example is the fashion model,

00:26:47.490 --> 00:26:54.070
actress, champion runner and TED lecturer
Aimee Mullins with fashion model good looks

00:26:54.070 --> 00:26:56.430
and a shape that's very Barbiesque.
\b [Laughter]

00:26:56.430 --> 00:27:03.770
\b0 Mullins is also a double amputee and she
quips that disability is a great advantage

00:27:03.770 --> 00:27:08.110
as a fashion model because she can make herself
as tall as she wants to be.

00:27:08.110 --> 00:27:11.840
\b [Laughter]
\b0 And she has a wide variety of prosthetic

00:27:11.840 --> 00:27:18.190
and functional and cosmetic legs that she
uses and proudly displays in all kinds of

00:27:18.190 --> 00:27:26.590
public performances of disability and femininity
and accessibility in the world. \

00:27:26.590 --> 00:27:32.090
The blind author Georgina Kleege has a series
of really wonderful books that I've been highly

00:27:32.090 --> 00:27:39.360
recommend. She's written a book called Sight
Unseen which investigates the metaphoric of

00:27:39.360 --> 00:27:46.850
sight and the blindness in the world. And
she has a wonderful epistolary set of personal

00:27:46.850 --> 00:27:55.270
essays called Blind Rage; it's one of the
best titles ever, Letters to Helen Keller.

00:27:55.270 --> 00:28:00.570
\
I think the most radical development and impromptutation

00:28:00.570 --> 00:28:06.970
[0:28:16] [Phonetic] of accessible has emerge
in disability of visual art -- disability

00:28:06.970 --> 00:28:14.720
art in general. The subjects of the portraits
that I'm presenting here have been traditionally

00:28:14.720 --> 00:28:21.410
characterized as people with disease, deformity,
disfigurement and I'd suggest, however, that

00:28:21.410 --> 00:28:29.120
these kinds of paintings begin to show us
how we might reimagine disability through

00:28:29.120 --> 00:28:35.590
aesthetics accessible technologies not as
a form inferiority that we want to eliminate

00:28:35.590 --> 00:28:40.110
from the human condition but rather perhaps
a form of rare beauty. \

00:28:40.110 --> 00:28:46.799
This is one of Harriet McBryde Johnson's terms
that I think is really important and interesting

00:28:46.799 --> 00:28:55.929
and out there as a kind of form of aesthetic
accessible technology that I'll talk about

00:28:55.929 --> 00:29:03.210
a little bit in the remainder of my time here.
Disability aesthetics, I want to suggest is

00:29:03.210 --> 00:29:10.290
a form of accessible technology that enables
us to understand embodiment and subjectivity

00:29:10.290 --> 00:29:15.960
in new ways. Art, photography and painting
has captured some of the ways that this rare

00:29:15.960 --> 00:29:23.630
beauty can be found in disability. It's a
beauty I suggest that emerges from distinctiveness

00:29:23.630 --> 00:29:31.140
rather than ordinariness, from struggle rather
than comfort and from the unusual rather than

00:29:31.140 --> 00:29:37.799
the usual. This is a photograph of fashion
shoot by the photographer, an English photographer,

00:29:37.799 --> 00:29:42.920
Knight -- Nick Knight and the late designer,
English designer Alexander McQueen who designed

00:29:42.920 --> 00:29:47.930
the series of costumes in a photo shoot called
Accessible. \

00:29:47.930 --> 00:29:48.930
\pard\pardeftab720\sl240\sa200\qj\pardirnatural

00:29:49.930 --> 00:29:53.330
\b0 \cf0 This is also a photograph on the
right of the model and the dancer Catherine

00:29:53.330 --> 00:30:01.010
Long who is born partially armless. It's a
really interesting sculptural posture in which

00:30:01.010 --> 00:30:09.610
her shoulder, her disarmed shoulder I want
to call it that is extended up and her arm

00:30:09.610 --> 00:30:18.930
is hanging down in a really beautiful sculptural
pose. The entry of disability in to contemporary

00:30:18.930 --> 00:30:25.730
dance is one of the most vibrant stories of
how accessible technology can facilitate and

00:30:25.730 --> 00:30:31.780
evolution of artistic form. The introduction
of the wheelchair in to dance has been suggested.

00:30:31.780 --> 00:30:38.200
I love this. It's the most important innovation
in contemporary dance since the toe shoe in

00:30:38.200 --> 00:30:46.410
ballet. \
So I'm going to show you -- oh... Okay. So

00:30:46.410 --> 00:30:53.510
one of the most interesting and controversial
uses of accessible technology in theatrical

00:30:53.510 --> 00:30:59.740
artistic production comes from none other
than Lady Gaga who uses disability technology

00:30:59.740 --> 00:31:06.799
such as wheelchairs, crutches and eye patches
as a kind of sensationalist fashion set of

00:31:06.799 --> 00:31:13.950
accessories and costuming in a music videos
and in her live performances. In July 2011,

00:31:13.950 --> 00:31:20.730
Lady Gaga rolled out for a performance in
Sydney using a wheelchair and a sensationalist

00:31:20.730 --> 00:31:27.740
performance of what I called disability drag.
In my view, the cultural work of using accessible

00:31:27.740 --> 00:31:36.730
technology associated with disabled people
-- scroll down a little bit here. Well, all

00:31:36.730 --> 00:31:57.880
right. Let's see if this works. How do I get
the mouse -- I mean how do to get the cursor

00:31:57.880 --> 00:32:01.230

is that to use -- to use disability technologies

00:33:15.800 --> 00:33:23.110
as a form theatrical costuming, moves what
we thought of as a medicalized disability

00:33:23.110 --> 00:33:29.510
prosthesis out of the world of medical stigmatization
in to the world of high fashion and celebrity

00:33:29.510 --> 00:33:32.480
which I think does some pretty interesting
cultural work. \

00:33:32.480 --> 00:33:37.390
\pard\pardeftab720\li2160\sl240\sa200\qj\pardirnatural
\cf0 So I' going to finish with a clip here.

00:33:37.390 --> 00:33:45.420
This is disabled dancer Bill Shannon who goes
by the stage name Crutch Man. He has evolved

00:33:45.420 --> 00:33:52.210
a new dance form and set of choreographic
moves using crutches that he requires, this

00:33:52.210 --> 00:33:57.370
is important, for mobility to fashion them
with a kind of rocker bottoms. So this is

00:33:57.370 --> 00:34:03.360
a very distinctive kind of technology that
he himself developed accessible technology

00:34:03.360 --> 00:34:08.859
in order to develop new break dancing moves.
Moreover and I think this is really important,

00:34:08.859 --> 00:34:13.679
we can talk about this if it's of interest
to you, Shannon's dancing is so compelling

00:34:13.679 --> 00:34:31.099
to have been used in a mainstream advertisement
for Visa Credit Cards. Ugh. This is the entirety

00:34:31.099 --> 00:34:32.099
of that.
\b [Music]

00:34:32.099 --> 00:34:35.299
\b0 So Shannon sitting on a bench. He gets
up and grabs those crutches and break dancing

00:34:35.299 --> 00:34:39.020
down the street.\

00:34:39.020 --> 00:34:45.510

\pard\pardeftab720\li2160\sl240\sa200\qj\pardirnatural

00:34:45.510 --> 00:35:00.119
\b0 \cf0 Rides down the baluster. Then glides,
pause\'85

00:35:00.119 --> 00:35:22.849
\b [loud music on the background]
\b0 Break dance. Side walk. Hops again at

00:35:22.849 --> 00:35:41.930
the ATM machine. Looking for access. Go to
another store.

00:35:41.930 --> 00:35:57.470
\b [Laughter]
\b0 Now, without being an apologist for consumers

00:35:57.470 --> 00:36:08.109
capitalism, I'd like to leave you with a thought
that is the difference between the 1525 crippled

00:36:08.109 --> 00:36:15.849
of Pieter Bruegel who's only access to economic
resources with begging in the public sphere

00:36:15.849 --> 00:36:21.589
and Bill Shannon, who's through accessible
technology and accessible world, an access

00:36:21.589 --> 00:36:31.920
to the kinds of resources, social capital
that he needed actually has a job. Thank you.

00:36:31.920 --> 00:36:43.359
\b [Clapping]
\b0 So I think we have maybe up to 30 minutes

00:36:43.359 --> 00:36:46.170
for questions.\

we put this and fearlessly dive in lots of

\pard\pardeftab720\sl240\sa200\qj\pardirnatural

\pard\pardeftab720\li2160\fi-2160\sl240\sa200\qj\pardirnatural
\cf0 Female 2: Hi. Just a briefing -- I was

00:36:57.359 --> 00:37:01.161
wondering when you were talking about the
different approaches of architecture that

00:37:01.161 --> 00:37:20.750
have accessibilities sort of [0:37:16] [Inaudible].
There's a particular image I saw that does

00:37:20.750 --> 00:37:22.609
a stairs a type actually like a wheelchair
in a ramp being sort of the main pull of the

00:37:22.609 --> 00:37:26.980
stairs and then as -- at the height of the
ramp is now certainly go around the ramp.

00:37:26.980 --> 00:37:28.569
And I'm just wondering if you would \'96 each
of this seems to me to be sort of [0:37:30]

00:37:28.569 --> 00:37:29.569
[Inaudible] photograph that demonstrated in
the way that [0:37:37] [Inaudible] body technology

00:37:29.569 --> 00:37:30.569
can build around accessible technology instead
of having the accessibilities. Sort of want

00:37:30.569 --> 00:37:31.569
to have your thought.\
Rosemarie: Yes, I'm not -- I don't -- I'm

00:37:31.569 --> 00:37:35.529
not an architect or a designer. So some of...
who are involved in that might be able to

00:37:35.529 --> 00:37:42.839
explain it a little bit more but as I understand
that universal design as a principle, a set

00:37:42.839 --> 00:37:51.680
of principles would put forward the concept
that there should be or that there might be

00:37:51.680 --> 00:38:00.119
one form of access that is universal to all
rather than multiple modes of access for different

00:38:00.119 --> 00:38:06.740
kinds of access. And I think those two ideas
are little bit intention and they are carried

00:38:06.740 --> 00:38:12.140
out in different ways by different designers
and different architects in making the built

00:38:12.140 --> 00:38:20.519
environment. I think it's actually quite interesting
to see multiple modes of access which would

00:38:20.519 --> 00:38:25.710
be the kind of thing you're suggesting a ramp
next two stairs because it provides multiple

00:38:25.710 --> 00:38:28.180
solutions and it provides people with alternatives.
\

00:38:28.180 --> 00:38:33.319
\pard\pardeftab720\li2160\sl240\sa200\qj\pardirnatural
\cf0 For example, ramps are not always the

00:38:33.319 --> 00:38:41.579
most beneficial or the most efficient ways
for all people to access a change of vertical,

00:38:41.579 --> 00:38:47.920
what is it called? Vertical, I don't know,
change of height -- that's not right but going

00:38:47.920 --> 00:38:57.880
up, for a bunch of different reasons and so
I think that -- I think, personally, there's

00:38:57.880 --> 00:39:02.880
a multiple design solutions to provide multiple
forms of access. That's certainly what public

00:39:02.880 --> 00:39:10.099
transportation does. So we have elevators.
We have escalators. We have ramps, varying

00:39:10.099 --> 00:39:15.799
ways of accessing a change of level. So thank
you. Other comments, question? Arguments?\

00:39:15.799 --> 00:39:19.740
\pard\pardeftab720\li2160\fi-2160\sl240\sa200\qj\pardirnatural
\cf0 Female 3: I have a question. It's really

00:39:19.740 --> 00:39:24.750
interesting you bringing up Lady Gaga and
Glee and your disability drive with a fantastic

00:39:24.750 --> 00:39:31.369
faith I hadn't heard before. And I agree your
point about kind of makes it more -- brings

00:39:31.369 --> 00:39:36.280
it -- more people make practical and high
fashion but I was wondering if what your thoughts

00:39:36.280 --> 00:39:40.519
were in terms of like even in Glee in one
episode, he gets up and walks and even in

00:39:40.519 --> 00:39:44.819
the video you just showed, you know, first
Lady Gaga had to be picked up by, you know,

00:39:44.819 --> 00:39:46.690
helpers and then later she's getting up and
walk -- \

00:39:46.690 --> 00:39:48.089
\pard\pardeftab720\sl240\sa200\qj\pardirnatural
\cf0 Rosemarie: Got to be --\

00:39:48.089 --> 00:39:49.089
[Crosstalk]\

00:39:49.089 --> 00:39:50.089
\b [0:40:07]\

00:39:50.089 --> 00:39:51.089

\pard\pardeftab720\li2160\fi-2160\sl240\sa200\qj\pardirnatural

00:39:51.089 --> 00:39:54.559
\cf0 Female 3: So a lot of these even in media
you see somebody who is in disability jive

00:39:54.559 --> 00:39:59.460
then later casting that off in this miraculously
recovery almost. And I was wondering if that

00:39:59.460 --> 00:40:03.960
might give like the wrong impression to some
people who may not be as familiar with minority

00:40:03.960 --> 00:40:08.119
bodies as you say that, oh, it's this choice
that they're in the wheelchair. This choice

00:40:08.119 --> 00:40:12.250
that using a technology even the fashion model,
you know, talks about the great things about

00:40:12.250 --> 00:40:16.549
it which is cool in terms of she can change
her legs but at the same time she doesn't

00:40:16.549 --> 00:40:17.759
have a choice to have --\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl240\sa200\qj\pardirnatural

00:40:17.759 --> 00:40:20.900
\cf0 Rosemarie: Real legs?\
Female 3: Yeah, so I was just curious what

00:40:20.900 --> 00:40:22.930
your thoughts were on that.\
\pard\pardeftab720\li2160\fi-2160\sl240\sa200\qj\pardirnatural

00:40:22.930 --> 00:40:26.329
\cf0 Rosemarie: No, that's a really good question
and of course, I am telling a very particular

00:40:26.329 --> 00:40:32.589
kind of story. There is much controversy as
there always is in, you know, sort of democratic

00:40:32.589 --> 00:40:41.349
public conversation about authenticity within
disability and also about varying stereotypes

00:40:41.349 --> 00:40:48.700
of disabilities such as the concept of overcoming
ones disability, the idea of cure, the idea

00:40:48.700 --> 00:40:59.210
of -- oh, I don't know, who ought and ought
not to be using these varying kinds of technologies

00:40:59.210 --> 00:41:04.469
which is, again, kind of question of authorship
and authority all the way around. I think

00:41:04.469 --> 00:41:07.210
that those are really vibrant and important
conversations. \

00:41:07.210 --> 00:41:09.910
\pard\pardeftab720\li2160\sl240\sa200\qj\pardirnatural
\cf0 I was just at the conference and someone

00:41:09.910 --> 00:41:16.549
gave a paper on Lady Gaga and of course, was
-- there's a lot of condemnation and a lot

00:41:16.549 --> 00:41:21.920
of understanding -- there's -- there's an
argument that would say that it's a trivializing

00:41:21.920 --> 00:41:27.719
of disability by someone who doesn't need
to use a wheelchair and using it, I support

00:41:27.719 --> 00:41:32.749
as, I'm sure you're able to see, a kind of
universalizing. For example, we've already

00:41:32.749 --> 00:41:38.309
done that with the accessible technology of
glasses. You know, all you need to is look

00:41:38.309 --> 00:41:42.829
at the New York Times for one second and you
see what's happened there. But of course,

00:41:42.829 --> 00:41:51.059
that's also creating a market for accessible
technology but I think making technology inclusive

00:41:51.059 --> 00:42:02.411
and available to everyone is a really important
democratic step so that for one thing, disability

00:42:02.411 --> 00:42:12.039
status is the most poorest of all of the social
categories. We say often that if anyone who

00:42:12.039 --> 00:42:22.180
lives long enough will become disabled eventually.
And so in some ways, being able to imagine

00:42:22.180 --> 00:42:32.060
big glasses or wheelchair use or canes or
even hearing aids as fashion accessories early

00:42:32.060 --> 00:42:38.279
on in life or at times in life when one is
able to occupy non-disabled status, I think

00:42:38.279 --> 00:42:44.589
is a good practice. \
I just met a woman at a conference who has

00:42:44.589 --> 00:42:52.640
-- who's hard of hearing and has been her
whole life and she had been using the kinds

00:42:52.640 --> 00:42:56.430
of hearing aids that have been developed.
She uses one hearing aid in each year that

00:42:56.430 --> 00:43:04.150
had been developed for kind of self -- self-hearing
aids, another words, that would look the very

00:43:04.150 --> 00:43:10.609
most inconspicuous. And she said she finally
decided to get her hair cut off short because

00:43:10.609 --> 00:43:15.380
she always had her hair long to cover up her
hearing aids. She got her hair cut short and

00:43:15.380 --> 00:43:21.799
it's really hip hairdo and she got hearing
aids -- well then, she doesn't call them hearing

00:43:21.799 --> 00:43:25.700
aids. There's another word for them now, inserts,
I think or something like that. That fills

00:43:25.700 --> 00:43:33.380
in the inside of her whole ear that are purple
and I said to her, "You ought to get rhinestones

00:43:33.380 --> 00:43:35.119
in them next.\'94
\b [Laughter]

00:43:35.119 --> 00:43:38.380
\b0 \
And her purpose is twofold. I this is really

00:43:38.380 --> 00:43:46.700
interesting. One is it's a disclosure method
so that she announces her status as hard of

00:43:46.700 --> 00:43:53.740
hearing so that people are able to -- hearing
people are able to be in better communication

00:43:53.740 --> 00:43:57.200
with her. They are better able to understand
who is it that they're dealing with and what

00:43:57.200 --> 00:44:02.470
kinds of interactions are going to ensue from
this. And also, it's a bit of a disability

00:44:02.470 --> 00:44:09.190
pride thing and it looks cool, plus her son
has the same hearing loss that she has and

00:44:09.190 --> 00:44:14.339
you know, he's got blue ones. And she wanted
to be able to say, you know, here mommy's

00:44:14.339 --> 00:44:18.039
there are purple, what color do you want and
you know, he has some that are red, white

00:44:18.039 --> 00:44:24.460
and blue and a variety of different one. They
are fashion, you know, hearing aids and that

00:44:24.460 --> 00:44:31.099
comes out of a disability pride movement that
would not have even possible thirty years

00:44:31.099 --> 00:44:37.119
ago. And her life works better that way not
because she hears better with the technology

00:44:37.119 --> 00:44:42.839
but because it's a technology that does other
kinds of things. It announces itself. Please.\

about like you were just saying during one

00:44:52.221 --> 00:44:58.579
of the NBA playoff games and the interview
afterwards Dwyane Wade was wearing a pair

00:44:58.579 --> 00:45:05.029
of fake glasses, no lenses because he doesn't
have a visual problem but he was wearing at

00:45:05.029 --> 00:45:11.410
style statement I looked online shortly there
after and there was a bunch of some comments

00:45:11.410 --> 00:45:17.450
that people had made, you know, sort of about
that sort of urging celebrities to start wearing

00:45:17.450 --> 00:45:22.319
fake hearing aids, hipster hearing aids they
were calling them. And --\

00:45:24.390 --> 00:45:31.779
\cf0 Male 2: And so I did have a question
about creating inclusive design not as much

00:45:31.779 --> 00:45:37.440
in the physical space but in the internet
and what your thoughts were about that, you

00:45:37.440 --> 00:45:41.920
know, particularly, you know, and things like
streaming video for people with hearing issues

00:45:41.920 --> 00:45:49.200
that's been a really big issue on struggle
in order to get companies to put captioning.

00:45:49.200 --> 00:45:54.369
And so what your thoughts were on some principles
that would be, you know, good in the outline

00:45:54.369 --> 00:45:59.999
space center. Perhaps what your thoughts of
all the, you know, statue in the law and court

00:45:59.999 --> 00:46:01.559
cases like with them [0:46:18] [Phonetic].
\

00:46:01.559 --> 00:46:04.319
\pard\tx2160\tx2445\pardeftab720\li2160\fi-2160\sl340\sa200\qj\pardirnatural
\cf0 Rosemarie: Well, I can't say a lot about

00:46:04.319 --> 00:46:11.390
that court cases and law. But you could to
Michael Stein over here in the Harvard Law

00:46:11.390 --> 00:46:15.700
School who had the Disability Law Project.
I think it's called Disability and Law Project

00:46:15.700 --> 00:46:27.009
and that's what he does. As I suggested, of
course, it is legislation that has rendered

00:46:27.009 --> 00:46:34.549
the desegregation of people with disabilities
along with the desegregation of women and

00:46:34.549 --> 00:46:39.539
people of color in the world. One of the main
differences and this is what I wanted to bring

00:46:39.539 --> 00:46:46.319
forward is that there's a -- a distinct materiality
to that desegregation in terms of disability

00:46:46.319 --> 00:46:55.140
access that is somewhat different from the
integration of women and the people of color

00:46:55.140 --> 00:47:03.579
in to public space in the democratic order
since the Civil Rights Movement. \

00:47:03.579 --> 00:47:07.099
And of course, it's interesting that the Civil
Rights Movements took place in the United

00:47:07.099 --> 00:47:11.619
States and elsewhere but certainly in the
United States contemporaneously. They all

00:47:11.619 --> 00:47:20.359
began more or less from the very late 1950's,
1960's, 1970's. We know about this what Harvard

00:47:20.359 --> 00:47:27.181
was gender -- desegregated in the early 1970's,
that's just one example. And the Disability

00:47:27.181 --> 00:47:33.479
Rights Movement which is interestingly enough
I didn't even know about until, you know,

00:47:33.479 --> 00:47:39.240
I was well in to adulthood because it didn't
have as much play took place at the same time.

00:47:39.240 --> 00:47:46.319
But it was carried out through these monumentally
important pieces of legislation just as gay

00:47:46.319 --> 00:47:51.789
marriages being carried out or equality in
marriage, pardon me, is being carried out

00:47:51.789 --> 00:48:01.259
in through the legal arena. Those decisions
have been made and that has transformed the

00:48:01.259 --> 00:48:04.170
world. \
So technology, of course, needs to be accessible

00:48:04.170 --> 00:48:10.499
also and it doesn't have the same kind of
materiality but there are guidelines and standards

00:48:10.499 --> 00:48:14.999
for accessible technology. There is something
-- somebody have to help me out here called

00:48:14.999 --> 00:48:24.109
Bobby which is a system of vetting and approval
that you can get if you're making a website

00:48:24.109 --> 00:48:29.010
that's Bobby approved which means that it\'92s
accessible for, for example, people using

00:48:29.010 --> 00:48:30.259
screen meters that's one of the main things.\

\cf0 Rosemarie: Yeah, there's -- here's a
lot being done about accessible, the standards

00:48:44.180 --> 00:48:49.890
and protocols for accessible technology. Another
really interesting development is Universal

00:48:49.890 --> 00:48:59.130
Design and Learning, UDL which is a set of
principles pedagogical strategies that have

00:48:59.130 --> 00:49:08.759
produced recommendations from multiple access
to learning that are fairly easily implemented

00:49:08.759 --> 00:49:17.180
in the same way that we argued that curb cuts
are a really easily implemented if they're

00:49:17.180 --> 00:49:25.170
built in instead of vaulted on and inexpensive.
That's same sort of theory is behind Universal

00:49:25.170 --> 00:49:31.450
Design and Learning. So you can just look
at UDL and see a billion samples fill it by

00:49:31.450 --> 00:49:33.380
[0:49:48] [Phonetic] and pedagogical strategies.

00:49:41.079 --> 00:49:44.599
\b0 \cf0 I know that there are some challenges
to the idea particularly for those who are

00:49:44.599 --> 00:49:49.269
in Magellan's [0:50:04] [Phonetic] Group saying
that universal design is really down play

00:49:49.269 --> 00:50:00.799
their concerns of not being in the mainstream
that it can be a very mainstream, of course,

00:50:00.799 --> 00:50:05.000
that says that leads are very instructional
issues are perhaps less important and while

00:50:05.000 --> 00:50:11.250
that it helps to accommodate them more in
the mainstream. It kind of can highlight the

00:50:11.250 --> 00:50:12.250
question of who has the right to each other
[0:50:25] [Phonetic] interested practice [0:50:26]

00:50:12.250 --> 00:50:17.630
[Phonetic] in building worlds or in building
technologies, is it just a mainstream or the

00:50:17.630 --> 00:50:20.591
people who can't live in to the mainstream
have the right also have that a world built

00:50:20.591 --> 00:50:21.591
[0:50:36] [Inaudible]. So I\'92m wondering
-- \

\pard\tx2160\pardeftab720\sl340\sa200\qj\pardirnatural

00:50:23.591 --> 00:50:24.609
\b0 Female 3: I was wondering if you could
link it to technology issue.\

00:50:24.609 --> 00:50:26.839
\pard\tx2160\pardeftab720\li2160\fi-2160\sl340\sa200\qj\pardirnatural
\cf0 Rosemarie: Well, I'm obviously using

00:50:26.839 --> 00:50:36.420
technology in this very broader sense and
my purpose there is to try to suggest a broad

00:50:36.420 --> 00:50:47.009
understanding of technology is being anything
that allows a kind of -- a tool would be one

00:50:47.009 --> 00:50:52.989
way of thinking about technology but even
that I think can be somewhat limited but some

00:50:52.989 --> 00:51:01.299
kind of a material thing that lies between
our fleshly embodiment and the environment

00:51:01.299 --> 00:51:08.539
that we live in and that we have to operate
in. So that kind of a definition would say

00:51:08.539 --> 00:51:14.039
that closer form of technology that tools
are a form of technology. Language is a form

00:51:14.039 --> 00:51:21.549
of technology. I mean we kind of know this
but the accessible technology allows a wide

00:51:21.549 --> 00:51:31.369
range of people to use the world that was
not built originally for them is and I suggested

00:51:31.369 --> 00:51:39.670
this but I think it's important it, it stills
in the sense that because we use it so comfortably,

00:51:39.670 --> 00:51:46.510
because the interface does it were between
the body and the world that allows us to do

00:51:46.510 --> 00:51:52.709
tasks and to be out in the world is so smooth
that it isn't often even noticed.\

00:51:52.709 --> 00:51:58.450
And that's one reason I wanted to bring forward
all this varying kinds of technologies, that's

00:51:58.450 --> 00:52:04.809
one reason I'd like to see Lady Gaga and anybody
else who wants to use, shoot wheelchairs or

00:52:04.809 --> 00:52:13.599
feather encrusted hearing aids does so so
that there's the widest distribution and use

00:52:13.599 --> 00:52:20.190
of technology and of course, one of the principles
of technology if that it has unintended usages.

00:52:20.190 --> 00:52:27.119
For example, I'm not exactly directing -- answering
your question but maybe I am. For example,

00:52:27.119 --> 00:52:31.829
the history of the Washington Metro being
built which I had mentioned briefly and gave

00:52:31.829 --> 00:52:35.890
you some examples is particularly interesting
and emblematic. \

00:52:35.890 --> 00:52:41.559
First of all, the Washington Metro they dug
a hole to build it in the 1970's. So it began

00:52:41.559 --> 00:52:47.019
being built in exactly the same time that
the legislation for an accessible world started

00:52:47.019 --> 00:52:51.799
being put forward. So the Architectural Barriers
Act was in 1968 that was the year that the

00:52:51.799 --> 00:52:59.299
Washington Metro got started. So it grew up
and got build as a material thing while the

00:52:59.299 --> 00:53:05.680
legislation and practices were developing.
And so it exemplary in that sense as opposed

00:53:05.680 --> 00:53:11.749
to a kind of retro fitted public transportation
system or one that was built much later after

00:53:11.749 --> 00:53:17.200
a lot of the design solutions and court cases,
I might add had been worked out. \

00:53:17.200 --> 00:53:22.660
So of course, the first thing was that the
to make the Washington Metro accessible, they

00:53:22.660 --> 00:53:26.789
said we got to have that their meaning the
advisors that I think largely came from the

00:53:26.789 --> 00:53:32.420
disability community and advocates for disability
access said you got to have elevators. And

00:53:32.420 --> 00:53:38.180
of course they said, "Are you kidding? We
got -- elevators cost too much. So how about

00:53:38.180 --> 00:53:43.190
just escalators?" And the argument went, "No,
you got to have elevators because a lot of

00:53:43.190 --> 00:53:47.930
people can't really use escalators very effectively."
I'm not sure quite but the examples are a

00:53:47.930 --> 00:53:51.979
bit say -- I might have this a little bit
wrong but sometimes cane users, escalators

00:53:51.979 --> 00:53:58.949
don't work really well. Certainly, you can't
take a motorize wheelchair on escalator either.

00:53:58.949 --> 00:54:01.690
\
So they said, "Okay. How about to save money

00:54:01.690 --> 00:54:07.589
and not build this elevators, let's -- let's
have a special van service you can call up

00:54:07.589 --> 00:54:12.219
and you can have a van come and pick you up
and take you to an accessible station or take

00:54:12.219 --> 00:54:17.989
you where you need to go." And a judge ruled
that that was separate but equal and that

00:54:17.989 --> 00:54:25.589
it was not allowable and ordered them to build
the elevators and now, of course, we understand.

00:54:25.589 --> 00:54:28.950
The argument would be why build the elevators,
there are only one or two people that are

00:54:28.950 --> 00:54:35.329
ever going to use them. So this -- we know
this principle about sort of unintended users

00:54:35.329 --> 00:54:44.239
or surprising consequences like rolling suitcases
for one thing. So that stands as a particular

00:54:44.239 --> 00:54:51.809
example of how people, groups that may not
be understand themselves to being in the mainstream

00:54:51.809 --> 00:54:56.499
can actually use accessible technology in
ways that the designers had not ever imagined.

\cf0 Rosemarie: Pundit, thank you.

00:55:10.959 --> 00:55:14.140
\b [Laughter]
\b0 A conservative pundit, but George Will

00:55:14.140 --> 00:55:22.029
also has a son who has down syndrome and he
has written really I think important things

00:55:22.029 --> 00:55:28.049
about the rights of inclusion and the rights
of people with disabilities and his son turned

00:55:28.049 --> 00:55:33.069
50 the other day and he wrote a series of
articles or a couple of articles, columns

00:55:33.069 --> 00:55:37.890
about this. And I couldn't believe my good
luck because I keep making the argument that

00:55:37.890 --> 00:55:44.329
the Washington DC Metro is fully accessible
to a wider range of people than was ever intended

00:55:44.329 --> 00:55:50.099
and he talked about his son going to baseball
games and fishing and using the Metro and

00:55:50.099 --> 00:55:58.719
that he knows how to use the Metro by himself
which means that the Metro is an accessible

00:55:58.719 --> 00:56:03.969
space for transportation. We can make the
argument that it's an accessible space of

00:56:03.969 --> 00:56:09.239
transportation up for people with developmental
disabilities. And so I was really glad to

00:56:09.239 --> 00:56:16.140
hear that. Question?\
Female 4: \'85 the widespread implementation

00:56:16.140 --> 00:56:23.670
of a new icon that looks like a friendly face
basically which is targeted for confidence

00:56:23.670 --> 00:56:28.729
to also psycho social disabilities which of
course more difficult to generalized about

00:56:28.729 --> 00:56:34.300
and support and so on and so and it's not
legible to everybody. I mean I see some commentary

00:56:34.300 --> 00:56:35.339
in the web like what does this means \'96\

00:56:37.339 --> 00:56:41.319
\cf0 Female 4: Yeah, yeah. It's like -- it's
like a sort of friendly face ideas. So...

00:56:41.319 --> 00:56:45.950
and then I think it's interesting provocation
for digital space because --\

00:56:45.950 --> 00:56:54.269
Rosemarie: If it's to indicate something else
or is it to be to create a kind of effective

00:56:54.269 --> 00:56:57.349
my environment right there?\
Female 4: I think that's the latter. So I

00:56:57.349 --> 00:57:01.690
think that it's to indicate like if you're
someone who has an anxiety disorder or you're

00:57:01.690 --> 00:57:09.299
someone who is overwhelmed by certain kind
of noise or the options of the space in a

00:57:09.299 --> 00:57:11.099
very bureaucratic space or something and you
need, you know, some mini amount support or

00:57:11.099 --> 00:57:12.099
something, you know, more involve like we
\'96 we \'96 or sort of aware and you can

00:57:12.099 --> 00:57:15.519
approach it and say, you know, need something.
So I do think for the digital space again,

00:57:15.519 --> 00:57:26.180
there are kind of supplements of that kind
of move or you sort of offer, you know, a

00:57:26.180 --> 00:57:28.109
helping hand or you haven't sort of decided
what that is --\

00:58:06.420 --> 00:58:18.280
challenges, let's say, traditional notions

\b0 \cf0 Rosemarie: But in relation to some
of this art and also in particular in relation

00:58:40.499 --> 00:58:50.380
to art that is sometimes considered sensationalist
or grotesque or surrealism which are -- are

00:58:50.380 --> 00:58:57.000
aesthetic movements or aesthetic categories
that actually feature what we think of as

00:58:57.000 --> 00:59:04.349
disability. I mean surrealism is about extravagant
disability. There's also quite a bit of interesting

00:59:04.349 --> 00:59:12.499
work that's been down around as I said grotesque,
the grotesque which is a literally in aesthetic

00:59:12.499 --> 00:59:19.230
category of hybridity. I was just at conference
in Edinburgh giving a keynote address in the

00:59:19.230 --> 00:59:25.609
name -- talk about sensationalist. The name
of the conference was Sensualising Deformity.

00:59:25.609 --> 00:59:31.219
It was terrific because of course what they
were doing was trying to figure out the connections

00:59:31.219 --> 00:59:40.410
between the fantastic and surreal representation
of, let's say, otherness and the political

00:59:40.410 --> 00:59:42.339
agendas involved in disability rights and
inclusion. \

00:59:50.940 --> 00:59:54.720
you one of the most interesting things I didn't
included here that I've discovered recently

00:59:54.720 --> 01:00:02.420
if you want an example of this kind of thing,
there is a British artist who works in the

01:00:02.420 --> 01:00:09.990
medium of photography named Alexa Wright,
W-R-I-G-H-T and she has a lot of series but

01:00:09.990 --> 01:00:15.920
this one series that she's done called After
Image is really fascinating and I've been

01:00:15.920 --> 01:00:22.200
trying to do some work around it. She has
made portraits and I'm very interested in

01:00:22.200 --> 01:00:27.829
portraits of people with disabilities as some
of the pictures I've suggested have or I\'92m

01:00:27.829 --> 01:00:35.190
sure have suggested. She did a series of photographic
portraits of I think six or seven people with

01:00:35.190 --> 01:00:44.319
phantom limb and they described -- you may
know what phantom limb is. It's the neurological

01:00:44.319 --> 01:00:52.510
experience of an amputated body part, hence,
phantom limb. It's a really wonderful term.

01:00:52.510 --> 01:00:55.150
\
Anyway, she talked to people with phantom

01:00:55.150 --> 01:01:02.499
limb, amputees obviously but phantom limb
and asked them what their experience of this

01:01:02.499 --> 01:01:09.969
phantom limb was like. And then she digitally
created that experience in the photographs.

01:01:09.969 --> 01:01:18.279
So for example, there is a picture that I
often show of a woman seated in a chair and

01:01:18.279 --> 01:01:23.519
one arm looks a little bit like this arm and
the other one looks a little bit like this

01:01:23.519 --> 01:01:28.930
arm except that there's a gap between the
wrist and the elbow because that's how this

01:01:28.930 --> 01:01:38.799
woman experiences in terms of sensation her
own body. So it's really quite fascinating

01:01:38.799 --> 01:01:44.999
to see that and it's one of the few places
that I have seen the subjective experience

01:01:44.999 --> 01:01:50.089
of disability represented visually. So it's
really interesting stuff. \

01:01:50.089 --> 01:01:56.359
So these kinds of things are being discussed
all the time. There is a very interesting

01:01:56.359 --> 01:02:02.190
sculpture up in Trafalgar Square that you
might have got a look at. I think it came

01:02:02.190 --> 01:02:10.390
down about a year or so ago because a public
art that's rotating. They -- a sculpture called

01:02:10.390 --> 01:02:14.939
Alison Lapper Pregnant done by Marc Quinn.
He's a very well-known British artist and

01:02:14.939 --> 01:02:24.189
he made this white marbles nude statue of
a nude woman on a pedestal except that she's

01:02:24.189 --> 01:02:28.439
rather significantly disabled. She has very
foreshortened arms and legs and she's pregnant.

01:02:28.439 --> 01:02:36.559
So it's an extremely controversial content
and an extremely conventional form and operated

01:02:36.559 --> 01:02:41.200
as a forum for a lot of interesting public
discussions about what we ought to be looking

01:02:41.200 --> 01:02:45.559
at, who are ought to be out in public, who
ought to be having reproducing and what not

01:02:45.559 --> 01:02:51.240
to be. So it was a very provocative in every
sense piece of public art where disability

01:02:51.240 --> 01:02:58.969
was doing something in the world to get some
good conversations up in a democratic order.

01:02:58.969 --> 01:02:59.969
\
\pard\tx2160\pardeftab720\li2160\fi-2160\sl340\sa200\qj\pardirnatural

01:02:59.969 --> 01:03:07.910
\cf0 Female 5: I'm curious what your thoughts
are with respect to financial access to disability

01:03:07.910 --> 01:03:14.180
technology and the impact of potentially mainstreaming
disability technology having on potentially

01:03:14.180 --> 01:03:20.039
technology that's necessary for people who
maybe more marginalize or wouldn\'92t fit

01:03:20.039 --> 01:03:24.449
within than that mold. I personally known
people not to get hearing aids because they

01:03:24.449 --> 01:03:29.920
don't feel like they can afford it which is
more simple or probably less expensive technology

01:03:29.920 --> 01:03:34.380
and then you're talking about we've seen some
very elegant prosthesis pieces and things

01:03:34.380 --> 01:03:41.430
like that my understanding of not having any
experience myself is that that is not necessarily

01:03:41.430 --> 01:03:47.599
accessible to most and if we're trying to
create a more accessible world, a more universally

01:03:47.599 --> 01:03:54.390
accessible world, how all that place together
both whether commoditizing it makes it more

01:03:54.390 --> 01:03:59.000
accessible or not sort of accessible through
health insurance and some things like that.\

01:03:59.000 --> 01:04:05.059
Rosemarie: Oh this is a very important question;
of course, it has to do with the allocation

01:04:05.059 --> 01:04:10.410
of resources. And those things are historically
and geographically quite specific. I mean

01:04:10.410 --> 01:04:15.690
California, for example, as you all know is
about financially just sinking in the ocean

01:04:15.690 --> 01:04:21.809
and so what -- the first thing that tends
to happen is that services for people with

01:04:21.809 --> 01:04:30.410
disabilities get cut and there is also a kind
of hierarchy of deservedness that operates

01:04:30.410 --> 01:04:37.999
perhaps not intentionally but functionally.
For example, we tend to think that categories

01:04:37.999 --> 01:04:46.269
like disabled veterans sort of deserve better
services and accommodations than say, people

01:04:46.269 --> 01:04:50.599
who have disabilities that involve volition
like addiction. \

01:04:50.599 --> 01:04:51.599
\pard\tx2160\pardeftab720\sl340\sa200\qj\pardirnatural

01:04:51.599 --> 01:04:52.599
\b \cf0 [1:05:09]\
\pard\tx2160\pardeftab720\li2160\sl340\sa200\qj\pardirnatural

01:04:52.599 --> 01:04:57.230
\b0 \cf0 So it's very complicated in that
sense and as I said I'm telling a very positive

01:04:57.230 --> 01:05:03.400
story, my own senses that the more universal
technology becomes, the cheaper it's going

01:05:03.400 --> 01:05:09.779
to become, the more available it's going to
become. But there will never be a universal

01:05:09.779 --> 01:05:18.609
solution to every particular accommodation
need. So while -- I don't even know how Aimee

01:05:18.609 --> 01:05:24.989
Mullins gets her legs or Oscar Pistorius or
how much they cost but there are really kind

01:05:24.989 --> 01:05:31.319
of prototypes and we know, those of us who
know anything about technology that the prototype

01:05:31.319 --> 01:05:38.549
always is expensive and exclusive and that
the more universalize to any kind of piece

01:05:38.549 --> 01:05:44.609
of technology becomes, the cheaper and more
accessible it becomes. \

01:05:44.609 --> 01:05:51.460
Here's one example in my view is that we are
developing sort of better and better and cheaper

01:05:51.460 --> 01:05:58.130
and cheaper but also in some ways more and
more expensive forms of addressing say, hard

01:05:58.130 --> 01:06:03.170
of hearing and deafness like cochlear implants
which are medicalized as opposed to a piece

01:06:03.170 --> 01:06:10.529
of technology that you just sort of stick
on are extremely important. What I'd like

01:06:10.529 --> 01:06:19.460
to see is an alternative less technological,
lower tech and less medicalized solution to

01:06:19.460 --> 01:06:25.489
the universal experience of hearing loss.
And anyone with a grandparent knows what I'm

01:06:25.489 --> 01:06:31.660
talking about here. And that is and this would
be really inexpensive, frankly, is to start

01:06:31.660 --> 01:06:39.019
teaching sign language in all schools as part
of the mandatory curriculum from kindergarten

01:06:39.019 --> 01:06:49.569
forward so that all people universally would
have some use and knowledge to one degree

01:06:49.569 --> 01:06:58.359
or another of sign language so that when people
transition in to the inevitable hearing, part

01:06:58.359 --> 01:07:03.420
of hearing status that they will, that they
can simply understand themselves as moving

01:07:03.420 --> 01:07:07.540
from one form of communication if they had
always been deaf or hard of hearing in to

01:07:07.540 --> 01:07:12.069
another form of communication rather than
relying on expensive technology. \

01:07:12.069 --> 01:07:17.710
Again, anyone with grandparents also knows
that has seen the scene of granddad taking

01:07:17.710 --> 01:07:21.329
that hearing aid out if his ear and he either
throwing it across the room or flushing it

01:07:21.329 --> 01:07:27.859
down the toilet because it doesn't -- it doesn't
do what we would expect it to do. Part of

01:07:27.859 --> 01:07:35.459
the narrative of that is that it restores
recognizable hearing the way it was and of

01:07:35.459 --> 01:07:41.430
course, it doesn't. And so in that sense,
that's pat of the limitation of technology.

01:07:41.430 --> 01:07:47.999
So if we all use sign language as the anthropologist,
medical anthropologist Nora Groce observed

01:07:47.999 --> 01:07:53.690
when she studied deafness on Martha's Vineyard
in the 19th century, we all use sign language,

01:07:53.690 --> 01:08:02.479
deafness as a disability would disappear.
So that's -- that's one way of addressing

01:08:02.479 --> 01:08:16.081
access without relying on expensive 
produced technology. With that said, I want

01:08:16.081 --> 01:08:18.739
everyone to have an iPhone with dictation
on it.

because thinking about the whole motion of

01:08:26.079 --> 01:08:33.119
using insurance to purchase or perhaps not
having available insurance to purchase these

01:08:33.119 --> 01:08:42.690
items, I know a young woman who uses communication
device because she's non-verbal and it's very

01:08:42.690 --> 01:08:49.049
expensive. It's very heavy, difficult to use
got an iPad. She could buy six iPads for the

01:08:49.049 --> 01:08:50.759
price of these communication devices --\

pay for the iPad because it's not use just

01:08:57.239 --> 01:09:03.069
for communication because it has other uses.
But they had --\

01:09:03.069 --> 01:09:05.969
Rosemarie: But that's what -- that's a glitch

we need to look these different things.\
Male 6: That's been an interesting problems

01:09:29.000 --> 01:09:30.040

feel like you made the point very well about

01:09:44.569 --> 01:09:51.319
the sort of benefits of universal design sort
of the inclusion of these communities as the

01:09:51.319 --> 01:09:57.010
way that we're all get benefit and you made
kind of the point through the art of power

01:09:57.010 --> 01:10:02.320
of inclusiveness in terms of getting people
out of the house or out in to public and sharing

01:10:02.320 --> 01:10:03.320
their unique perspective.\

whether how far if the economic argument of

01:10:09.820 --> 01:10:16.131
sort of diversity and inclusiveness and getting
all of these other communities which would

01:10:16.131 --> 01:10:18.110
otherwise often being excluded from various
workplaces in to -- in to the market [1:10:36]

01:10:18.110 --> 01:10:24.469
[Phonetic] places ideas goes against this
argument whether it's hey, it's not about,

01:10:24.469 --> 01:10:29.750
you know, ethical inclusion. It's about \'96
this is about money. We're generating job.

01:10:29.750 --> 01:10:33.700
We're creating livelihoods and we're adding
in kind of a capacity for innovation that

01:10:33.700 --> 01:10:35.050
we otherwise we not have.\

01:10:35.050 --> 01:10:42.480
\cf0 Rosemarie: That's exactly right. In a
democratic order, we should strive to have

01:10:42.480 --> 01:10:52.820
everyone included in these public spaces in
order to exercise the obligations and the

01:10:52.820 --> 01:10:58.000
rights of citizenship. And one of the rights
of citizenship is employment and access to

01:10:58.000 --> 01:11:04.239
education. And one of the obligations of citizenship
is contribution in some way and it's much

01:11:04.239 --> 01:11:10.200
better to have people in the workforce than
not. So which is not to say that we should

01:11:10.200 --> 01:11:14.420
do way to social security and services for
people with disabilities and it's a complicated

01:11:14.420 --> 01:11:21.199
world but I think that's exactly what we\'92re
after. And the only way that it can occur

01:11:21.199 --> 01:11:30.590
is through a built environment that is accessible.
I mean that a disabled person can be in this

01:11:30.590 --> 01:11:34.690
