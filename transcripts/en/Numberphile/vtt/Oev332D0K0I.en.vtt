00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:03.010
ROGER BOWLEY: I want to talk
about the number 15 in

00:00:03.010 --> 00:00:05.780
English, but it's not English
that you know.

00:00:05.780 --> 00:00:08.500
This is going to be Celtic
English, before

00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:10.020
the Romans came here.

00:00:10.020 --> 00:00:12.460
So it's not going to be English
that comes from

00:00:12.460 --> 00:00:15.340
German, like ein, zwei,
drei, 1, 2, 3.

00:00:15.340 --> 00:00:21.310
This is the form of English
used by shepherds to count

00:00:21.310 --> 00:00:22.560
their flocks.

00:00:24.430 --> 00:00:27.530
And I've spent quite a lot of
time, Brady, learning how to

00:00:27.530 --> 00:00:31.740
say yan, tan, tethera,
pethera, pimp

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:34.385
for 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.

00:00:34.385 --> 00:00:36.030
TICH RIVETT: Well,
there's yan, tan,

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:38.350
tethera, pethera, pimp.

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:39.480
ROGER BOWLEY: Pimp is five.

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:42.130
I find that quite
nicely amusing.

00:00:42.130 --> 00:00:46.920
And then, it's cethera,
lethera,

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:50.160
hoverer, coverer, dik.

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:54.670
And then you get onto the next
numbers, which are yanadik,

00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:56.260
because it's 1 and 10.

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:59.350
Yanadik, tanadik, tetheradik,
petheradik,

00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:00.970
and then it's bumfit.

00:01:00.970 --> 00:01:02.900
So 15 is bumfit.

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:05.810
And if you want to take anything
away from this, it is

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:08.080
a pimp plus a dik is a bumfit.

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:12.900
And then you get yanabumfit,
tanabumfit, tetherabumfit,

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:15.960
petherabumfit, figgit.

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:18.490
TICH RIVETT: Tetheradik,
bumfit.

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:21.950
Cetherabumfit, letherabumfit,
figgit.

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:24.720
And hang on, I'm starting to
get a notch in me stick.

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:26.940
ROGER BOWLEY: Now, this changes
depending on which

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:27.720
part of the country.

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:29.490
This is the Lincolnshire
version.

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:32.150
If you go down south,
it's more refined.

00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:35.050
So it's yain, tain,
tethera, pethera.

00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:38.880
So this is 5 sheep plus
10 sheep equals 15.

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:41.260
All right, there's a little
woolly thing with a head out

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:42.043
here and a little toe.

00:01:42.043 --> 00:01:43.580
And he's coming along.

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:49.030
All right, this is a
pimp plus a dik.

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:50.590
Oh, I can't even say it right.

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:54.445
Dik is equal to a bumfit.

00:01:57.730 --> 00:02:00.470
In some part of the country,
that has two T's, but that's

00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:02.270
not really relevant at all.

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:04.860
So you have up to 20.

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:13.490
So a pimp plus the dik plus
another pimp is a figgit.

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:20.650
They get to figgit, they get to
20 sheep, and they couldn't

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:21.490
cope with that.

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:24.210
I mean, that's hard enough to
do, and it'll keep you awake.

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:27.630
So if you're actually counting
sheep this way, you'll keep

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:29.060
awake rather than nodding off.

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:31.150
And then they put a stone
in their pocket.

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:36.470
So at 20, they stop at 20, and
they start counting again with

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:38.470
a stone in their pocket
or a marble.

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:40.780
Or they might draw a
line on the ground.

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:42.780
And then they would go,
the same thing again

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:43.840
for the next 20.

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:48.260
So this is a base 20 system,
which is not very good because

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:52.510
you have to rely on something
else in order to count up to

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:54.000
maybe 80 or 100.

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.400
Because they want to take their
sheep over somewhere

00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:58.520
else and flock them off
on other numbers.

00:02:58.520 --> 00:03:00.200
And they want as many
as possible.

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:03.870
People keep it going, but there
was a tradition until

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:07.720
about 1900 where the farmers and
the shepherds were still

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:11.770
using this, so it became part
of the culture written down.

00:03:11.770 --> 00:03:13.540
And so there's a
record of this.

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:17.010
Not a television record, but a
record of it, so that people

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:18.140
know about this system.

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:19.620
And it's different in different
parts of the

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:23.140
country, including Scotland,
including Wales.

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:24.440
BRADY HARAN: What was it
about these numbers

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:25.980
that appealed to you?

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:27.380
Are you a bit juvenile,
or what is it?

00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:28.640
ROGER BOWLEY: Yeah, yeah.

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:31.760
I find as I get older,
I immature with age.
