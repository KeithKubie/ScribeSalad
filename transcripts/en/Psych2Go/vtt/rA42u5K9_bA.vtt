[Intro]

00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:14.340
When I left for college, everyone told me the same thing:

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:19.840
That the next four years of my life would be the best four years of my life. There would be parties,

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:22.660
tons of friends, and it'd be amazing.

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:26.889
Once I got to campus however, things seemed to go differently.

00:00:27.739 --> 00:00:32.289
My dorm was actually a suite, shared with six other people, in a hallway with fifty.

00:00:33.079 --> 00:00:35.859
This was a big change from having
a bedroom to myself.

00:00:36.559 --> 00:00:41.319
Between lectures, group projects, date nights, and even the dining commons,

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:47.540
my people quota was constantly filled.
I was never, never alone.

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:52.320
Everything and everywhere was constant noise, and I didn't get any solitude.

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:56.799
I learned quickly that having time to myself was a privilege... i took for granted.

00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:01.800
By day, my head was constantly filled with voices.

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:06.800
Judgments, opinions and comparisons, that would simply just amp up my anxiety.

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:14.960
With school clubs and making friends, and doing all the social activities i thought I had to do to fit in.
I became tired.

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:20.460
My mental capacity for school was drained.
I was able to pick up my grades near the end,

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:24.480
but only at the cost of increased
anxiety, stress and fatigue.

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:27.310
I knew I was losing myself.

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:31.239
Being an ambivert meant I needed a balance of social time, and me-time.

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:37.460
So I took a calendar out and scheduled some me-time, to regain that balance.

00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:47.720
Child Development researcher and author Kenneth
H. Rubin acknowledges that solitude is an important tool to bring balance into one's life.

00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:50.229
It needs to be in healthy doses however.

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:54.400
It works when one has a social group,
and can regulate their own emotions.

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:58.660
With this, solitude can be a time
to achieve creativity and peace.

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:03.300
So I set out to find a place where I could be alone.

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:06.620
Study spots, secret nooks and crannies.

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:12.000
While i did get comfortable doing things alone, i ended up just feeling alone in the crowd.

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:18.359
I needed true solitude. I needed to be completely alone. In person, and through my phone.

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:20.880
I needed to be alone.

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:25.800
According to psychologists and professor
Peter S., having time alone

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:32.069
is valuable for those with anxiety, as it protects
from over-stimulation. In this world
of constant access to social Media,

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:39.630
we have shortcuts in communication. Because of these ready-made interactions online, we're losing our chance to be truly alone.

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:43.239
I finally put the phone away.

00:02:43.239 --> 00:02:49.919
Free to think for myself, free from
judgments and opinions which weren't mine.
I was finally becoming grounded.

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:56.069
No more over-stimulation, and no more people who would make my anxiety worse, and trying to calm me down.

00:02:57.280 --> 00:03:00.209
Constantly asking if my anxiety
has stopped being a thing.

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:04.109
The constant pressure of being
watched made my anxiety worse,

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:08.640
but telling them that would only make them more persistent, and trying to make me feel okay.

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:12.390
but when I was completely alone,
there was no pressure.

00:03:13.209 --> 00:03:16.409
I cried, panicked, screamed if I had to.

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:22.470
Didn't need other people's stories and opinions. In that moment, i could just be me.

00:03:23.319 --> 00:03:25.319
Express the way I needed to.

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:28.889
By finding that could finally find peace of mind.
