[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:06.830 --> 00:00:08.840
DANIEL SANK:
Information is physical.

00:00:08.840 --> 00:00:11.660
Written letters are
carbon grains on paper.

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:14.870
Spoken words are vibrations
of air molecules.

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:17.240
Computer bits are
electric charge.

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:20.660
Each of these examples
shares a common limitation--

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:24.530
they work under physics that was
understood in the 1800s, known

00:00:24.530 --> 00:00:26.190
as classical physics.

00:00:26.190 --> 00:00:28.250
Science has
progressed since then.

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:32.330
We've discovered a new set of
laws called quantum mechanics.

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:35.120
Here's one of our chips
designed to leverage

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:37.640
the rules of quantum mechanics
to process information

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:42.800
in ways impossible on a computer
based in classical physics.

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:44.750
You may have heard that
quantum mechanics only

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:47.850
applies to microscopic
objects, like atoms.

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:50.420
So how does this chip
bring out quantum behavior?

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:53.570
I'm Daniel Sank, a research
scientist working in the Google

00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:55.850
AI Quantum Computing Lab.

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:58.310
In this video, we'll
look at how our quantum

00:00:58.310 --> 00:01:00.200
bits are made physically.

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:02.540
I want to explain the
fundamental differences

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:04.940
between classical and
quantum information

00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:06.770
at the physical
level so that you

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:11.380
can understand why our quantum
bits are made how they are.

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:13.400
Physicists and
computer scientists

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:15.710
both think in terms of states.

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:18.190
A physical state
could be my position--

00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:21.340
I can be on the left
or on the right.

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:24.760
And physical laws determine
how nature goes from one state

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:25.900
to another.

00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:26.770
Observe.

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:32.010
If Sergio pushes me,
my state changes.

00:01:32.010 --> 00:01:35.410
A computer's state is the
value of its memory bits

00:01:35.410 --> 00:01:38.350
and computer programs
determine how the computer goes

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:40.640
from one state to the next.

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:43.180
For example, when you
hit the Play button,

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:45.610
YouTube's program started
manipulating your computer's

00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:48.610
memory to show this video.

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:51.790
Where physics has physical
states and natural laws,

00:01:51.790 --> 00:01:56.020
computer science has
memory states and programs.

00:01:56.020 --> 00:02:00.130
Think of the state of computer
memory as a string of bits.

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:04.210
For end bits, there are two
to the end possible strings.

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:06.850
But because we're based
in classical physics,

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:09.550
the state of the
computer is just one

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:12.400
of these states at
each point in time.

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:16.390
On each step of a classical
algorithm, we go from one state

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:17.600
to the next.

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:21.220
For example, the logic
operation shown here

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:25.930
takes the state 0-0-0 to 1-1-0.

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:28.310
If we were to apply the
same operation again,

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:31.620
we'd go from 1-1-0 to 0-1-0.

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:35.160
Compared to classical states,
quantum states are more rich.

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:38.690
They can have weight in all
possible classical states,

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:41.160
a situation physicists
call superposition.

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:44.370
Each step of a quantum
algorithm mixes the states

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:46.470
into complex superpositions.

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:49.710
For example,
starting in 0-0-0, we

00:02:49.710 --> 00:02:55.080
go to a superposition of
1-0-0, 1-0-1, and 1-1-1.

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:57.710
Then each of those three
parts of the super post

00:02:57.710 --> 00:03:01.830
state branches out
to even more states.

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:04.260
The extra complexity
of quantum computers

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:06.030
allows them to
solve some problems

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:09.060
faster than a classical
computer ever could.

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:11.010
We've discussed the
computational difference

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:13.350
between classical
and quantum, but how

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:16.170
do classical and quantum
differ physically?

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:18.150
How do we bring out
quantum mechanics

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:20.490
in our chip, which
is so much bigger

00:03:20.490 --> 00:03:23.100
than the tiny atoms in
which quantum mechanics was

00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:24.960
first discovered?

00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:27.360
Let's take a detailed
look at classical bits

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:29.430
at the physical
level so that we can

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:32.430
understand the physical
difference between classical

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:33.570
and quantum.

00:03:33.570 --> 00:03:35.370
Classical computer
bits are stored

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:37.440
in the presence or
absence of charge

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:39.360
on a capacitor in
a circuit called

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:42.270
dynamic RAM, or DRAM for short.

00:03:42.270 --> 00:03:44.860
If there's charge,
it's a logical 1,

00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:47.160
and if there's no
charge, it's a logical 0.

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:48.980
But there's more going on here.

00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:52.170
Our logical 0 and 1
are actually made up

00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:56.580
of the presence or absence
of 300,000 electrons.

00:03:56.580 --> 00:03:57.960
Why use so many?

00:03:57.960 --> 00:04:01.560
In principle, we could just use
the presence or absence of one

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:03.880
electron as our logical bid.

00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:06.840
Well, physical bits are noisy.

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:11.370
Electrons are tiny and light, so
they jiggle around and leak out

00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:12.930
of the DRAM.

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:16.440
If we had only one electron
and it were to leak out,

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:19.740
our bit would change
value, which is an error.

00:04:19.740 --> 00:04:23.830
By using lots of electrons,
we're OK if a few leak out.

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:27.540
DRAM circuits periodically
check the logical level

00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:30.630
and replenish missing electrons.

00:04:30.630 --> 00:04:35.100
Encoding one logical bit in the
state of so many physical bits

00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:38.130
gives classical information
a level of reliability

00:04:38.130 --> 00:04:40.090
that we take for granted.

00:04:40.090 --> 00:04:42.780
We don't have to think about all
those electrons bumping around

00:04:42.780 --> 00:04:45.160
when we write our programs.

00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:48.320
OK, so why can't we
just put our DRAM

00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:51.780
into a quantum
superposition of 0 and 1?

00:04:51.780 --> 00:04:55.220
Well, suppose we did
have that superposition.

00:04:55.220 --> 00:04:56.870
It wouldn't last long.

00:04:56.870 --> 00:05:00.170
As soon as we do the first
check to protect against a DRAM

00:05:00.170 --> 00:05:04.310
error, we've forced the
bit into either 0 or 1,

00:05:04.310 --> 00:05:07.010
removing the quantum
superposition state.

00:05:07.010 --> 00:05:09.860
In fact, that
collapse happens even

00:05:09.860 --> 00:05:12.080
without us checking for errors.

00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:16.220
A single photon interacting
with just one of our electrons

00:05:16.220 --> 00:05:18.530
can carry off information.

00:05:18.530 --> 00:05:21.410
When that happens,
it's as if the photon

00:05:21.410 --> 00:05:26.090
observed the quantum state
and the state collapses.

00:05:26.090 --> 00:05:30.920
You can think of this as nature
observing and thus destroying

00:05:30.920 --> 00:05:32.900
our quantum states.

00:05:32.900 --> 00:05:36.560
Errors like this are unique
to quantum information.

00:05:36.560 --> 00:05:39.590
In classical computing,
you might be upset

00:05:39.590 --> 00:05:42.500
if somebody peeks at your
bits, but that peek doesn't

00:05:42.500 --> 00:05:45.170
completely destroy them.

00:05:45.170 --> 00:05:48.280
Note that an error occurs
whenever nature observes

00:05:48.280 --> 00:05:52.000
any one of our physical
bits, so while we normally

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:55.720
stack up more physical
bits for redundancy,

00:05:55.720 --> 00:05:59.380
that approach actually
makes quantum errors worse.

00:05:59.380 --> 00:06:02.660
That's the main difficulty
in quantum computation--

00:06:02.660 --> 00:06:05.200
the fundamental quantum
constituents of matter

00:06:05.200 --> 00:06:08.140
are small and easily
subjected to noise,

00:06:08.140 --> 00:06:10.780
but we can't brute force
our way around that noise

00:06:10.780 --> 00:06:13.720
with redundancy because
bigger systems are

00:06:13.720 --> 00:06:16.450
more subject to quantum errors.

00:06:16.450 --> 00:06:18.340
At Google, we use
a technique that

00:06:18.340 --> 00:06:20.690
gets the best of both worlds.

00:06:20.690 --> 00:06:23.590
We use circuits with a
huge number of electrons,

00:06:23.590 --> 00:06:26.830
but we prevent quantum errors
with superconductivity.

00:06:26.830 --> 00:06:30.490
In regular metals, like with
a conventional DRAM circuit,

00:06:30.490 --> 00:06:33.730
every individual electron
does its own thing.

00:06:33.730 --> 00:06:36.250
As electrons move around,
they can bounce off

00:06:36.250 --> 00:06:38.530
the positively charged
ions of the metal,

00:06:38.530 --> 00:06:41.920
radiating vibrational waves that
carry off quantum information

00:06:41.920 --> 00:06:43.640
about the electrons.

00:06:43.640 --> 00:06:47.020
This hectic, bustling cauldron
of physical interactions

00:06:47.020 --> 00:06:49.630
generates a lot
of quantum errors,

00:06:49.630 --> 00:06:53.300
and the information gets
lost before we can use it.

00:06:53.300 --> 00:06:56.200
However, when certain
metals are cooled down,

00:06:56.200 --> 00:06:59.530
their electrons join
together in a single unit.

00:06:59.530 --> 00:07:02.250
The individual electrons
no longer scatter

00:07:02.250 --> 00:07:07.180
and the rate of quantum
errors drops to almost 0.

00:07:07.180 --> 00:07:10.240
Our quantum bits are, in fact,
just electoral oscillators

00:07:10.240 --> 00:07:11.950
built from aluminum,
which become

00:07:11.950 --> 00:07:15.540
superconducting when cooled
to below 1 degree Kelvin.

00:07:15.540 --> 00:07:19.840
The oscillators store tiny
amounts of electrical energy.

00:07:19.840 --> 00:07:23.470
When the oscillator is in
the 0 state, it has 0 energy.

00:07:23.470 --> 00:07:27.610
When it's in the 1 state, it
has a single quantum of energy.

00:07:27.610 --> 00:07:32.200
The two states of the oscillator
with 0 or 1 quantum of energy

00:07:32.200 --> 00:07:34.570
are the logical states
of our quantum bit,

00:07:34.570 --> 00:07:36.980
or qubit for short.

00:07:36.980 --> 00:07:39.520
Here's a picture of a
superconducting qubit

00:07:39.520 --> 00:07:41.440
along with a circuit diagram.

00:07:41.440 --> 00:07:44.470
The crosses indicate
Josephson tunnel junctions,

00:07:44.470 --> 00:07:47.470
which are nonlinear
superconducting inductors.

00:07:47.470 --> 00:07:49.840
We pick the resonance
frequency of our oscillators

00:07:49.840 --> 00:07:53.260
to be about 6 gigahertz, which
sets the energy difference

00:07:53.260 --> 00:07:55.540
between the 0 and 1 states.

00:07:55.540 --> 00:07:57.790
That's a low enough
frequency that we

00:07:57.790 --> 00:08:00.670
can build control electronics
from readily available

00:08:00.670 --> 00:08:03.850
commercial parts,
but also high enough

00:08:03.850 --> 00:08:05.920
that the ambient
thermal energy doesn't

00:08:05.920 --> 00:08:09.210
scramble the oscillation
and introduce errors.

00:08:09.210 --> 00:08:13.660
6 gigahertz corresponds
to 300 millikelvin.

00:08:13.660 --> 00:08:17.230
Fortunately, refrigerators
that get to 15 millikelvin

00:08:17.230 --> 00:08:19.990
are relatively standard
commercial products.

00:08:19.990 --> 00:08:25.000
For comparison, outer
space is about 2.5 Kelvin.

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:27.190
I think it's cool that
the cryostats in our lab

00:08:27.190 --> 00:08:30.070
are colder than deep space.

00:08:30.070 --> 00:08:32.530
Now let's take a minute to
make a few comments on how

00:08:32.530 --> 00:08:35.260
superconducting qubit
architecture differs

00:08:35.260 --> 00:08:38.620
from conventional computers.

00:08:38.620 --> 00:08:42.760
In a conventional computer,
memory and logic processing

00:08:42.760 --> 00:08:46.090
are separated into
the RAM and CPU.

00:08:46.090 --> 00:08:47.980
When we want to
do a computation,

00:08:47.980 --> 00:08:52.120
we first move the data
from the RAM to the CPU.

00:08:52.120 --> 00:08:55.300
Then the circuits in the
CPU do the computation,

00:08:55.300 --> 00:08:59.620
and finally, the resulting
data is written back to RAM.

00:08:59.620 --> 00:09:02.800
In quantum computing, with
superconducting qubits,

00:09:02.800 --> 00:09:05.080
we can't afford the
errors that would come

00:09:05.080 --> 00:09:07.150
from moving the data around.

00:09:07.150 --> 00:09:11.290
Instead, we build a grid of
qubits, each one connected

00:09:11.290 --> 00:09:12.640
to its neighbors.

00:09:12.640 --> 00:09:15.640
The qubits stay put and
we do logic operations

00:09:15.640 --> 00:09:19.180
by sending control signals
into individual qubits

00:09:19.180 --> 00:09:22.324
or pairs of qubits.

00:09:22.324 --> 00:09:24.490
Now that you have a basic
picture of superconducting

00:09:24.490 --> 00:09:27.400
qubits, let's take a look
at one of the challenges

00:09:27.400 --> 00:09:29.560
that we're still working on.

00:09:29.560 --> 00:09:32.650
Superconductivity
greatly reduces errors,

00:09:32.650 --> 00:09:34.150
but there are still some.

00:09:34.150 --> 00:09:38.170
For example, the electrons
flowing in the oscillator

00:09:38.170 --> 00:09:40.870
interact with charged
particles in the surroundings,

00:09:40.870 --> 00:09:42.370
leading to errors.

00:09:42.370 --> 00:09:46.990
Suppose there were a charged ion
inside the metal of our qubit.

00:09:46.990 --> 00:09:48.790
The oscillating
energy in the qubit

00:09:48.790 --> 00:09:52.660
can transfer into that ion,
causing the qubit's logic state

00:09:52.660 --> 00:09:55.690
to flip, thus creating an error.

00:09:55.690 --> 00:09:58.060
Improving the qubit
fabrication process

00:09:58.060 --> 00:10:00.430
to reduce these
atomic imperfections

00:10:00.430 --> 00:10:02.770
is a big part of our research.

00:10:02.770 --> 00:10:05.050
Over the last several
years, improvements

00:10:05.050 --> 00:10:06.700
in microfabrication
techniques have

00:10:06.700 --> 00:10:09.550
decreased our qubit
error rates a lot,

00:10:09.550 --> 00:10:11.560
and we're still improving.

00:10:11.560 --> 00:10:13.690
In this video, we
focused on the idea

00:10:13.690 --> 00:10:15.790
that information is physical.

00:10:15.790 --> 00:10:17.650
We discussed the
physical incarnation

00:10:17.650 --> 00:10:20.500
of classical and
quantum computer bits.

00:10:20.500 --> 00:10:22.950
We introduced quantum
errors and explained

00:10:22.950 --> 00:10:26.800
why we need superconductivity
to eliminate those errors.

00:10:26.800 --> 00:10:29.020
If you'd like to know more,
you can leave questions

00:10:29.020 --> 00:10:30.667
in the comments section below.

00:10:30.667 --> 00:10:32.500
It's important to me
that you can understand

00:10:32.500 --> 00:10:34.810
the physical aspects
of quantum computation

00:10:34.810 --> 00:10:36.940
as clearly as possible.

00:10:36.940 --> 00:10:39.610
I'm also pretty active on
Physics Stack Exchange.

00:10:39.610 --> 00:10:42.930
You can find great questions
and answers there, too.
