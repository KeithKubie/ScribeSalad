00:00:00.138 --> 00:00:00.981
- [Instructor] Let's talk a little bit

00:00:00.981 --> 00:00:02.979
about animal communication.

00:00:02.979 --> 00:00:06.912
And, in general,
communication is one party

00:00:06.912 --> 00:00:10.739
giving information to
another party somehow,

00:00:10.739 --> 00:00:12.037
and it doesn't even have to be one to one.

00:00:12.037 --> 00:00:15.085
It could be one person
giving, or one animal,

00:00:15.085 --> 00:00:16.392
if we're talking about
animal communication,

00:00:16.392 --> 00:00:20.243
giving information to many other animals.

00:00:20.243 --> 00:00:21.620
And communication doesn't even

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:23.796
just have to happen between animals.

00:00:23.796 --> 00:00:26.772
A plant can actually
communicate to an animal

00:00:26.772 --> 00:00:30.526
through it's appearance or by
releasing certain chemicals.

00:00:30.526 --> 00:00:33.534
But we'll focus in this video
on animal communication.

00:00:33.534 --> 00:00:36.347
And it's interesting because
even we humans are animals.

00:00:36.347 --> 00:00:37.776
And the more that we think about this,

00:00:37.776 --> 00:00:40.255
the more types of communication
we'll see around us,

00:00:40.255 --> 00:00:41.379
and it'll be interesting to think about

00:00:41.379 --> 00:00:45.104
why we do that communication
and how we do it.

00:00:45.104 --> 00:00:49.273
So, let's think about the
types of animal communication.

00:00:49.273 --> 00:00:53.356
So, we can think of visual,
visual communication.

00:00:54.323 --> 00:00:56.118
Just me drawing a diagram like that

00:00:56.118 --> 00:00:58.683
is a form of visual communications.

00:00:58.683 --> 00:01:02.526
So, we can have things like pictures,

00:01:02.526 --> 00:01:03.984
pictures,

00:01:03.984 --> 00:01:04.817
diagrams,

00:01:06.021 --> 00:01:06.913
writing.

00:01:06.913 --> 00:01:08.983
Writing's interesting
because it's conveying

00:01:08.983 --> 00:01:10.230
kind of thought ideas.

00:01:10.230 --> 00:01:12.275
It is conveying information,
it is something you look at,

00:01:12.275 --> 00:01:14.985
so I would put writing here.

00:01:14.985 --> 00:01:16.059
Writing.

00:01:16.059 --> 00:01:18.485
You have even more basic
types of visual communication,

00:01:18.485 --> 00:01:21.119
even if we stick to human beings.

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:24.045
The most obvious one I can
think of is facial expressions.

00:01:24.045 --> 00:01:27.795
If you see someone who
has a smile like that,

00:01:30.886 --> 00:01:32.764
they seem very approachable.

00:01:32.764 --> 00:01:34.542
It feels like, hey, they're communicating,

00:01:34.542 --> 00:01:36.034
even if they're not
consciously doing it, that,

00:01:36.034 --> 00:01:37.497
"Hey, you can approach me, I'm friendly.

00:01:37.497 --> 00:01:40.039
"Why don't you come talk
to me or we can hang out."

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:43.045
While if someone looks like this,

00:01:43.045 --> 00:01:45.180
where they're kind of glaring,

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:47.803
where someone looks like
this, then you might say,

00:01:47.803 --> 00:01:49.184
"Okay, this person doesn't look like

00:01:49.184 --> 00:01:51.490
"they wanna be bothered right now.

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:56.071
"Maybe I'm not interested in
messing with that person."

00:01:56.071 --> 00:01:58.922
And when you think about
facial expressions,

00:01:58.922 --> 00:02:02.399
it's very fundamental for us human beings,

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:06.335
but why do we view this one
on the left as more friendly

00:02:06.335 --> 00:02:08.146
and this one on the
right as more aggressive?

00:02:08.146 --> 00:02:12.903
Well, it's through millions
of years of evolution

00:02:12.903 --> 00:02:14.649
that these things just came about.

00:02:14.649 --> 00:02:18.133
And we recognize kind
of an aggressive posture

00:02:18.133 --> 00:02:20.355
or a friendly posture in our own species,

00:02:20.355 --> 00:02:21.425
and in other species as well.

00:02:21.425 --> 00:02:24.587
We know when a dog is
showing its teeth that,

00:02:24.587 --> 00:02:26.730
okay, maybe I don't wanna
mess with it as much.

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:27.820
But if it's wagging it's tail,

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:30.467
okay, maybe it's in a friendly mood.

00:02:30.467 --> 00:02:32.600
And similarly, it's not
just pictures and diagrams

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:34.276
and writing and facial expressions,

00:02:34.276 --> 00:02:36.222
it could be body postures.

00:02:36.222 --> 00:02:38.678
This is true of humans, it's
also true of other animals.

00:02:38.678 --> 00:02:41.320
There's a whole TED talk
on these power poses,

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:43.459
these poses that you can take on

00:02:43.459 --> 00:02:46.876
that can kind of establish your dominance

00:02:47.974 --> 00:02:51.597
in an environment,
especially with other humans,

00:02:51.597 --> 00:02:54.692
but it's probably not just
humans, also with other animals.

00:02:54.692 --> 00:02:58.742
You'll also see, if you watch
these nature specials on TV,

00:02:58.742 --> 00:03:00.591
animals striking certain poses

00:03:00.591 --> 00:03:02.848
that exhibit their dominance in some way

00:03:02.848 --> 00:03:06.045
or their position in some
type of a social hierarchy.

00:03:06.045 --> 00:03:07.234
You also have animals,

00:03:07.234 --> 00:03:08.768
just by the nature of their appearance,

00:03:08.768 --> 00:03:11.388
that are communicating with other animals.

00:03:11.388 --> 00:03:14.570
For example, there's
a lot of animals that,

00:03:14.570 --> 00:03:17.084
by their coloration, they're
signalling to other animals

00:03:17.084 --> 00:03:20.374
that, "Hey, it's probably
not a good idea to eat me."

00:03:20.374 --> 00:03:22.909
For example, if this is
a frog right over here,

00:03:22.909 --> 00:03:25.949
it's not that well-drawn of a frog,

00:03:25.949 --> 00:03:27.990
but frogs are famous,
especially some of the ones

00:03:27.990 --> 00:03:29.882
that have these vibrant colors,

00:03:29.882 --> 00:03:33.010
that these are signals to
other potential predators

00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:34.814
that, "Hey, you don't wanna eat me.

00:03:34.814 --> 00:03:36.325
"I am poisonous.

00:03:36.325 --> 00:03:37.885
"I will likely make you sick

00:03:37.885 --> 00:03:40.494
"or even kill you if you eat me."

00:03:40.494 --> 00:03:42.549
And the predators know that.

00:03:42.549 --> 00:03:43.845
It could either be innate

00:03:43.845 --> 00:03:46.380
through millions of years of evolution,

00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:50.038
the ones that have learned
to avoid the colors

00:03:50.038 --> 00:03:51.671
live on and pass their genes,

00:03:51.671 --> 00:03:53.858
or it might some type of learned behavior,

00:03:53.858 --> 00:03:55.795
that they tried to eat
one of these frogs once

00:03:55.795 --> 00:03:56.997
and it made them really sick,

00:03:56.997 --> 00:03:59.545
so they're gonna avoid it again.

00:03:59.545 --> 00:04:02.381
As we know, visual isn't the
only type of communication.

00:04:02.381 --> 00:04:04.541
In fact, normally, when we
talk about communications,

00:04:04.541 --> 00:04:08.532
we often think of speech and
language or spoken language.

00:04:08.532 --> 00:04:11.282
So, I'll write that down, speech.

00:04:12.183 --> 00:04:15.001
Or let me write auditory.

00:04:15.001 --> 00:04:16.918
Auditory communication.

00:04:18.714 --> 00:04:20.797
And that could be speech,

00:04:25.992 --> 00:04:29.335
this could be some type
of a bark, a dog barking,

00:04:29.335 --> 00:04:32.661
saying, "Hey, stay away from
here; don't mess with me."

00:04:32.661 --> 00:04:34.244
It could be a roar.

00:04:35.912 --> 00:04:37.985
A lion's roar might be a way of saying,

00:04:37.985 --> 00:04:39.722
"Hey, I am dominant here.

00:04:39.722 --> 00:04:41.053
"Don't come here."

00:04:41.053 --> 00:04:42.991
Or if you're a potential
mate, if you're a lioness,

00:04:42.991 --> 00:04:45.421
saying, "Hey, look how nice my roar is.

00:04:45.421 --> 00:04:48.882
"Wouldn't you want to come
and start a family with me?"

00:04:48.882 --> 00:04:50.590
And it doesn't even have to be something

00:04:50.590 --> 00:04:52.643
that kind of comes from your throat.

00:04:52.643 --> 00:04:57.053
It could be beating of
the chest by a gorilla,

00:04:57.053 --> 00:05:01.425
once again, to exert its
dominance in some way.

00:05:01.425 --> 00:05:03.927
It could be some sound that an animal does

00:05:03.927 --> 00:05:06.818
as a warning to other animals to run away

00:05:06.818 --> 00:05:07.981
because it sees a predator.

00:05:07.981 --> 00:05:10.531
So, we can keep thinking
of more and more examples

00:05:10.531 --> 00:05:13.868
of each of these forms of communication.

00:05:13.868 --> 00:05:15.442
Now, other forms of communication

00:05:15.442 --> 00:05:19.419
that might be a little bit less
obvious, you have chemical.

00:05:19.419 --> 00:05:21.336
Chemical communication.

00:05:22.468 --> 00:05:24.583
So, what's a example of
chemical communication?

00:05:24.583 --> 00:05:27.386
Well, we know that a lot
of animals, including dogs,

00:05:27.386 --> 00:05:30.719
like to mark their territory with urine.

00:05:31.684 --> 00:05:34.816
And when other animals come
by, especially other dogs,

00:05:34.816 --> 00:05:37.612
they'll smell that urine
that might've been applied

00:05:37.612 --> 00:05:38.876
to a tree someplace that says,

00:05:38.876 --> 00:05:41.337
"Okay, this is some other dog's territory.

00:05:41.337 --> 00:05:43.952
"I'm gonna go someplace else."

00:05:43.952 --> 00:05:45.845
There's things like pheromones.

00:05:45.845 --> 00:05:47.495
Let me write this down.

00:05:47.495 --> 00:05:48.412
Pheromones.

00:05:50.111 --> 00:05:52.030
Pheromones are chemical signals.

00:05:52.030 --> 00:05:53.753
Even human emit pheromones

00:05:53.753 --> 00:05:55.808
that are not necessarily consciously

00:05:55.808 --> 00:05:59.033
but subconsciously sensed by other humans

00:05:59.033 --> 00:06:03.010
and they can drive attraction
between those humans.

00:06:03.010 --> 00:06:05.573
So, once again, it's chemical signals.

00:06:05.573 --> 00:06:09.640
One animal is giving
information to another.

00:06:09.640 --> 00:06:11.549
Now, another form of communication,

00:06:11.549 --> 00:06:14.799
once again, not as obvious, is tactile.

00:06:16.070 --> 00:06:17.903
Tactile communication.

00:06:18.783 --> 00:06:21.472
And this could be a form of
kind of a nurturing touch

00:06:21.472 --> 00:06:25.386
by the mother to communicate
to the child that it is safe.

00:06:25.386 --> 00:06:27.676
It could be a warning.

00:06:27.676 --> 00:06:29.980
You could imagine you're at a dinner party

00:06:29.980 --> 00:06:33.549
and your significant other
kind of steps on your toe

00:06:33.549 --> 00:06:35.981
when you find yourself saying
things that you shouldn't say.

00:06:35.981 --> 00:06:37.682
That's all tactile communication.

00:06:37.682 --> 00:06:40.320
"Hey, I'm giving you the information

00:06:40.320 --> 00:06:41.819
"that you're starting
to talk about something

00:06:41.819 --> 00:06:44.888
"that you're not supposed to talk about."

00:06:44.888 --> 00:06:46.196
So, now that we've talked about

00:06:46.196 --> 00:06:48.698
some of these general
forms of communication,

00:06:48.698 --> 00:06:50.156
and I encourage you to just look around

00:06:50.156 --> 00:06:52.331
either your own life or
just the animal world

00:06:52.331 --> 00:06:55.295
and think about all the forms
of communication around you,

00:06:55.295 --> 00:06:58.602
let's think about why
animals actually communicate,

00:06:58.602 --> 00:06:59.993
including humans.

00:06:59.993 --> 00:07:01.202
And we often think ourselves

00:07:01.202 --> 00:07:03.848
as somehow beyond the natural world.

00:07:03.848 --> 00:07:05.066
But when you really think about it,

00:07:05.066 --> 00:07:06.545
most of our forms of communication

00:07:06.545 --> 00:07:09.270
fall into the categories
we're about to talk about.

00:07:09.270 --> 00:07:12.937
One category is coordinate group behavior.

00:07:12.937 --> 00:07:13.770
Coordinate

00:07:14.761 --> 00:07:16.351
group

00:07:16.351 --> 00:07:17.975
behavior.

00:07:17.975 --> 00:07:22.892
So, for example, if we are
about to go fight in a war,

00:07:22.892 --> 00:07:24.506
there might be communication about,

00:07:24.506 --> 00:07:26.290
well, how do we approach the enemy?

00:07:26.290 --> 00:07:28.757
In what order do we do it?

00:07:28.757 --> 00:07:31.403
It could be a team, where we make a plan,

00:07:31.403 --> 00:07:34.132
either a visual or auditory plan somehow.

00:07:34.132 --> 00:07:36.429
I don't know how you could
actually do a chemical plan,

00:07:36.429 --> 00:07:38.810
but that would be interesting.

00:07:38.810 --> 00:07:39.694
There's other things.

00:07:39.694 --> 00:07:42.444
You could be caring for the young

00:07:43.585 --> 00:07:46.516
as your main purpose for communication.

00:07:46.516 --> 00:07:47.784
Care

00:07:47.784 --> 00:07:49.309
for

00:07:49.309 --> 00:07:50.256
young.

00:07:50.256 --> 00:07:52.977
Once again, it could be
something like tactile

00:07:52.977 --> 00:07:56.143
or even visual communication
or auditory communication

00:07:56.143 --> 00:07:57.796
that makes the young feel nurtured

00:07:57.796 --> 00:07:59.773
or you might be training them in some way.

00:07:59.773 --> 00:08:01.052
In fact, even this video,

00:08:01.052 --> 00:08:03.212
even the whole notion of Khan Academy,

00:08:03.212 --> 00:08:06.172
it's a form of communication
that you could argue

00:08:06.172 --> 00:08:08.248
is about coordinating
group behavior in some way,

00:08:08.248 --> 00:08:09.865
helping to educate more people

00:08:09.865 --> 00:08:12.806
so that they can
participate in a better way,

00:08:12.806 --> 00:08:15.086
or you could view it
as caring for the young

00:08:15.086 --> 00:08:16.671
or some combination.

00:08:16.671 --> 00:08:19.552
But there's other reasons
why you communicate.

00:08:19.552 --> 00:08:22.302
You could be defending territory.

00:08:23.424 --> 00:08:24.964
Let me do this in a new color.

00:08:24.964 --> 00:08:27.456
You could be defending,

00:08:27.456 --> 00:08:28.289
defending

00:08:29.341 --> 00:08:30.174
territory.

00:08:31.498 --> 00:08:33.511
Obviously, something like
a no trespassing sign

00:08:33.511 --> 00:08:35.168
does it very explicitly.

00:08:35.168 --> 00:08:37.850
In fact, even a fence,
the existence of a fence

00:08:37.850 --> 00:08:40.911
is a form of communication.

00:08:40.911 --> 00:08:42.095
And obviously, in the animal world,

00:08:42.095 --> 00:08:44.082
we can think of it all
the time with a bark

00:08:44.082 --> 00:08:48.249
or with leaving your chemical
signature on a tree to say,

00:08:49.279 --> 00:08:51.584
"Hey, don't come here.

00:08:51.584 --> 00:08:53.319
"This is my territory."

00:08:53.319 --> 00:08:56.902
And a very big role or
use of communication

00:08:57.825 --> 00:08:59.838
that you'll see throughout
the animal world,

00:08:59.838 --> 00:09:02.546
even in humans if you
really think about it,

00:09:02.546 --> 00:09:04.296
is in finding a mate,

00:09:06.156 --> 00:09:07.521
is in finding a mate.

00:09:07.521 --> 00:09:10.411
You know, when someone goes
and buys that fancy sports car,

00:09:10.411 --> 00:09:12.166
it's probably more than they need

00:09:12.166 --> 00:09:14.086
just to get from point A to point B,

00:09:14.086 --> 00:09:16.660
but it might signal
something to potential mates,

00:09:16.660 --> 00:09:18.480
that, hey, I have a lot of earning power

00:09:18.480 --> 00:09:21.268
or I'm flashy or whatever
else it might be.

00:09:21.268 --> 00:09:23.573
And related to that is
you might wanna signal

00:09:23.573 --> 00:09:25.660
some type of dominance.

00:09:25.660 --> 00:09:28.017
And that dominance might
be for a potential mate

00:09:28.017 --> 00:09:29.601
or it might be to defend your territory,

00:09:29.601 --> 00:09:30.986
tell other people to step aside,

00:09:30.986 --> 00:09:32.335
or that, hey, you should be the one

00:09:32.335 --> 00:09:33.891
that's coordinating the group's behavior

00:09:33.891 --> 00:09:37.871
(laughs) instead of someone else.
