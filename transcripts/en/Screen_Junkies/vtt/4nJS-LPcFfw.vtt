00:00:08.269 --> 00:00:12.860
From the man who created some of your fondest
childhood memories, then took a huge dump

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:13.860
on them

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:18.250
Comes the prequel sequel that proved Phantom
Menace wasn’t an accident.

00:00:18.250 --> 00:00:22.130
"This isn't how it's supposed to be."

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:25.130
Episode II: Attack of the Clones.

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:28.490
Once again the republic is in turmoil.

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:33.000
Watch as the chin-stroking Jedi are pulled
into a war between a completely disposable

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.770
droid army and a completely disposable clone
army.

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:40.970
Seriously, there is no reason to get emotionally
involved in any of this crap.

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:46.370
Experience an awkward, forced love story as
soulless as the computer it was made in

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:50.500
With so many visual effects, the filmmakers
didn’t have any time left over for things

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:51.500
like

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:52.739
realistic choreography

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:53.930
realistic dialogue

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:59.040
"I'm haunted by the kiss that you should never
have given me."

00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:02.160
Or realistic Hayden Christensen acting.

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:13.439
"I don't like sand: it's coarse and rough
and irritating and it gets everywhere.

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:14.520
Not like here."

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:18.259
C'mon, JJ, there's no way you can do any worse
than this.

00:01:18.259 --> 00:01:22.149
Natalie Portman and her space hair return
as Senator Padme Amidala.

00:01:22.149 --> 00:01:27.060
When two of the galaxy’s best sharpshooting
assassins try to kill her with a poisonous

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:28.459
worm pooping robot,

00:01:28.459 --> 00:01:31.259
two Jedi warriors will come to her aid:

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:37.479
Obi Wan Kenobi, a man forced to act opposite
lifeless CGI characters like Hayden Christenson...

00:01:37.479 --> 00:01:39.649
and Anakin Skywalker,

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:44.759
a rat-tailed a**hole who’s been creepily
stalking Padme for the last decade.

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:47.409
"I’ve thought about her every day since
we parted.”

00:01:47.409 --> 00:01:49.399
"I don’t think she liked me watching her.”

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:51.090
"I'd much rather dream about Padme."

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:52.749
"You're exactly the way I remember you in
my dreams."

00:01:52.749 --> 00:01:54.679
"Please don't look at me like that."

00:01:54.679 --> 00:01:57.490
"Why not?"

00:01:57.490 --> 00:02:02.889
"It makes me feel uncomfortable."

00:02:02.889 --> 00:02:05.380
"Sorry, m'lady."

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:06.630
Ugh.

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:11.330
Ride along with these one-dimensional heroes
in a movie so unevenly paced, you’ll have

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:15.050
to wait over an hour before you even meet
the main villain.

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:20.150
Instead, strap yourself in for even more of
the stuff that made Phantom Menace so cold,

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:21.150
lifeless,

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:22.420
and boring, like...

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:24.800
People sitting and talking,

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:26.090
Standing and talking,

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:27.670
Walking and talking,

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:31.340
One person standing and talking while another
is sitting and talking,

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:35.750
People standing and talking then taking a
seat for more talking,

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:36.750
And

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:45.110
a whole bunch of wipes.

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:52.920
Starring...

00:02:52.920 --> 00:03:01.500
Haydon’t Act Again

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:03.050
Ewan A Bad Movie

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:04.050
Yogurt

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:05.190
M. Bison

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:06.720
Nipply Portman

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:08.290
Lawrence Fishburn

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:10.340
Definitely Not the Emperor

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:11.340
Dickhead

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:12.800
Cthulhu

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:14.090
Darth Saruman

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:16.820
and Jango Unbrained

00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:21.950
Star Wars Episode 11: Attack of the Clones.

00:03:21.950 --> 00:03:25.400
Correct me if I’m wrong here but the clones
never attack anyone in this movie.

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:29.000
So why the f*** would you call this movie
Attack of the Clones?!

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:44.960
