00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.440
Lune as in lunar and a lune in mathematics looks something like this.

00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:08.980
Brady: "And is that like the modern word for that? That's what you would call it?"

00:00:09.060 --> 00:00:10.740
Oh that's what we'd call it I suppose, yeah.

00:00:11.380 --> 00:00:12.260
"It looks like a crescent to me."

00:00:12.640 --> 00:00:14.560
Crescent? You could call it that.

00:00:15.180 --> 00:00:21.920
This is a mathematical object that was of interest a number of millennia ago, and it's still of interest.

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:30.360
We have a real sense of what Hippocrates of Chios, 5th century BC mathematician

00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:36.440
he was interested in, can I say, even though this doesn't occur in his text at all, squaring the circle.

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:39.460
So what does it mean to square the circle?

00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:48.960
What it means really is to find, at least the way I'm going to interpret it, is to find a polygon of the same area as the circle

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:52.640
and to find it in some constructive manner.

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:58.580
What Hippocrates was interested in doing was finding the area of such figures

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:01.300
in terms of the area of polygons.

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:06.760
"He wanted to construct a polygon that had the same area as a lune?"

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:08.560
As some lunes.

00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:10.420
He wasn't able to do it

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:17.820
for all, or even in some sense, very many. But he certainly was able to do it, and here's the starter lune.

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:23.820
Starter lune begins with making an isosceles right angle triangle

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:25.820
and here's the right angle.

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:29.200
And thinking of that triangle as being inscribed,

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:31.940
if you wish, in a semi-circle.

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:35.160
The next thing I would like to do is make another circle

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:38.860
with this hypotenuse as chord.

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:42.960
Well, I'd want to take either one of these snippets of circles

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:46.700
either this one or that one, they're both of equal area and equal shape.

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:51.600
I'm gonna to try to view this line as the chord of a circle

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:56.440
so that the figure I make will be similar to this one or that one.

00:01:56.860 --> 00:02:01.760
I'm gonna try. It's not all that easy, but I'll try to do it, okay?

00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:06.360
So these three dashed things are similar.

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:10.520
Let me draw it a second time, enlarged now.

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:15.660
Now the question is, what can we say about the area of this guy,

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:18.740
in terms of the area of this guy?

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:24.500
Or equivalently, in terms of the area of this guy, because the last two guys have the same area?

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:28.600
Well, if you remember our Pythagorean theorem,

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:34.480
This length is the square root of 2 times either of these lengths.

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:41.760
So, if the linear measure is the square root of 2 of the big segment,

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:47.960
is the square root of 2 times the linear measure of the small, either of the two small segments,

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:50.740
what's the area

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:56.280
of the big segment in terms of the area of either of the smaller segments?

00:02:58.320 --> 00:03:00.320
It's the square of the linear ratio.

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:05.520
Okay. So this is twice the area of this, twice the area of that.

00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:09.320
Another way of saying it is, this area is the sum of these two areas.

00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:13.940
So suppose I start with that triangle, and I'll draw it again,

00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:18.460
and I remove this blob, this area,

00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:24.640
and now I have to add something to keep the area of the triangle the same,

00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:28.260
and what I'm gonna do is add the two small blobs.

00:03:28.460 --> 00:03:30.000
So what does that mean?

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:34.780
That means that the area of the triangle

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:37.920
is the area

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:42.320
between these two semicircles.

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:45.960
So what has Hippocrates done, if he's done that?

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:51.980
He has, in some funny way, squared this particular lune. This is a lune.

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:54.900
"He hasn't squared it, though. He's triangled it."

00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:57.080
He's polygoned it, if you wish.

00:03:57.420 --> 00:03:59.420
Now, that's not where he ends his investigations.

00:03:59.800 --> 00:04:01.800
"That's pretty clever, though."

00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:06.180
It's already pretty clever. I think of this as the starter construction.

00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:09.980
This, it's not clear in the manuscript, by the way,

00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:12.240
or the text that one has from his manuscript,

00:04:12.580 --> 00:04:16.140
whether he starts this way, and this is his inspiration,

00:04:16.140 --> 00:04:21.260
but how can it not be? This is surely his starter lune construction.

00:04:21.540 --> 00:04:25.960
The minute you do that, you might imagine going into the business of

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:32.000
squaring, or triangulating, or polygon-ating, as many lunes as you possibly can.

00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:36.800
Let me start with the construction, essentially with this straight line.

00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:41.020
So, I'm gonna make this the chord of a number of circles.

00:04:41.540 --> 00:04:43.540
Same line, but the chord of different circles.

00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:48.160
So it could be the chord of, well, it could be the chord of,

00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:53.280
I hope I'm gonna draw it convincingly as a circle, such a circle.

00:04:53.280 --> 00:04:55.280
"That's not the best circle I've ever seen."

00:04:55.640 --> 00:04:59.700
Or it could be the chord, the same line could be the chord of this circle.

00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:05.120
Now every time I think of this as the chord of a circle, I get a pie slice of that circle.

00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:10.860
I draw the line from the center to the two ends of the chord, and there's my pie.

00:05:11.320 --> 00:05:14.240
If I do it here, the pie slice would be pretty big.

00:05:14.540 --> 00:05:17.500
This is a rather generous portion of pie.

00:05:17.780 --> 00:05:22.040
How do we get our lunes? Well, we get our lunes by taking this same chord

00:05:22.480 --> 00:05:26.940
and making two circles with that as a chord of different radii,

00:05:27.180 --> 00:05:31.180
and thereby getting two different pie slices.

00:05:31.260 --> 00:05:33.260
Okay, like this.

00:05:33.640 --> 00:05:37.580
That's gonna be big, I guess.

00:05:38.160 --> 00:05:41.500
And like this, and that's gonna be somewhat smaller.

00:05:41.860 --> 00:05:43.440
"And where's the lune here?"

00:05:43.720 --> 00:05:46.440
Ah, here's my lune.

00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:51.140
Now, what turns out, in each of Hippocrates' constructions,

00:05:51.640 --> 00:05:59.960
is he's constructed his chord and his lunes in such a way that the area of this lune

00:06:00.300 --> 00:06:04.960
is exactly equal to the area of this little, uh,

00:06:04.960 --> 00:06:08.000
what shall we call it? Polygon with a little concave...

00:06:08.220 --> 00:06:09.700
"A spearhead, isn't it?"

00:06:09.860 --> 00:06:13.940
Spearhead. And how does he do this? Well, by ingenuity.

00:06:14.260 --> 00:06:16.260
And he produces a number of examples.

00:06:16.740 --> 00:06:21.280
He does it by a certain process that would be too long to give in this numberphile.

00:06:21.640 --> 00:06:25.080
But, he does it quite beautifully.

00:06:25.260 --> 00:06:31.260
Hippocrates manages to construct situations where the area of this pie wedge

00:06:31.260 --> 00:06:35.340
is equal to the area of this pie wedge,

00:06:35.340 --> 00:06:39.080
and so therefore they have a common area which is this,

00:06:39.080 --> 00:06:41.280
and that implies that this area is equal to this area.

00:06:41.540 --> 00:06:50.500
It is a consequence of a very careful choice of the radii of the two circles given the chord.

00:06:50.880 --> 00:06:57.760
There is a serious mathematical question which can be phrased in modern-day mathematical vocabulary,

00:06:57.880 --> 00:07:00.480
it becomes a question in Galois Theory.

00:07:00.820 --> 00:07:07.620
Has Hippocrates constructed all, or perhaps, almost all of the possible constructions

00:07:07.620 --> 00:07:09.620
given his methods?

00:07:09.620 --> 00:07:11.620
"Has he found all the lunes that can be spearheaded in this way?"

00:07:12.360 --> 00:07:14.360
Spearheaded, spearheaded! wonderful word!

00:07:15.060 --> 00:07:17.060
"And what's the answer? Did he? Did he find them all?"

00:07:17.460 --> 00:07:23.240
He, well, this is a, a conversation any modern mathematician can have with a 5th century BC mathematician.

00:07:23.800 --> 00:07:25.360
I don't know the answer.

00:07:25.600 --> 00:07:27.240
I worked on it a little.
