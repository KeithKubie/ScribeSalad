00:00:00.920 --> 00:00:04.800
Being from a marginalized 
community myself,

00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:06.160
being a Two-Spirit person,

00:00:06.160 --> 00:00:08.080
being an Indigenous person,

00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:10.240
I know how scary it can be

00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:14.760
to access care from the health care field.

00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:27.240
- Dr. James Makokis is not your 
average family physician.

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:31.120
He's the only doctor working with transgender patients 

00:00:31.120 --> 00:00:33.040
in Enoch First Nation, 

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:37.320
a Cree reserve of 2,400 people in central Alberta.

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:43.560
Many of his patients drive up to 8 hours and walk miles along dirt roads

00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:48.640
to see this Two-Spirit Indigenous specialist who makes them feel safe.

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:52.480
"Two-Spirit" is a contemporary English term

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:57.480
to reflect gender diversity that Indigenous Nations have always had. 

00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:00.360
- In our language [Navajo], we say “nádleeh.”

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.920
So “nádleeh” means “ambient being."

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:07.320
So if you think about energetic forces inside of body,

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:10.960
it's like these two forces that oscillate back and forth. 

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:15.440
It's not just male, it's not just female, 
it's male–female, back and forth, all the time.

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:24.680
- For the past three years, Dr. Makokis has crafted 
his unique approach to transgender care

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:29.000
by bringing together Indigenous and Western teachings.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:34.360
And his biggest contribution is his openness about his own identity.

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:39.160
- James has a helped me accept myself because he accepts himself.

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:42.720
He made me feel comfortable in my own skin.

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:51.000
- I don't know what other doctor can help a young boy
become into a Cree warrior man.

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:07.920
- Enoch Health Center or Maskêhkosihk, which means
“where the medicines grow” in Cree,

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:10.560
is a 30-minute drive from Edmonton.

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:13.480
- Just getting to clinic.

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:16.200
This is where I usually keep my stuff.

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:20.000
We don’t have much space here,

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.800
so this is kind of how I make it work.

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:24.000
That’s my little locker.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:29.400
- This is where Dr. Makokis sees patients from 9:30 a.m. till late afternoon.

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:32.160
- We try to make it GLBT-friendly.

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:35.560
So we have some rainbow stickers everywhere.

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:39.640
This is the washroom.
So, it’s a gender-neutral washroom.

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:44.560
- And because many in Alberta can't access transgender care elsewhere,

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:47.160
they come here, to the Enoch reserve.

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:51.200
- So Leah actually has a really important part of her story, 

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:53.320
where she was in a darker place

00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:58.000
and it was very difficult for her not accepting who she is as a trans woman

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:00.920
And that's something completely different where she is today. 

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:05.840
– When did you start on hormones? 

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:08.240
– October 26th, 2018. 

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:10.400
– What are some of the changes that you've noticed?

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:12.200
– I just feel myself finally. 

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:20.400
My anxiety’s gone down, I feel happier, I feel like I'm complete or on my way to be complete.

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:23.000
– Well, I lived in fear, in secrecy.

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:26.960
Being born in the late 50s and growing up in the 60s, 70s, 

00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:29.440
there was no internet, there was no one to talk to.

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:32.400
And so I carried a lot of this inside.

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:36.320
I can recall many times in my life where I actually thought of suicide.

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:39.240
And I’m glad I never acted on it.

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:44.360
I come from a large French Catholic family.

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:45.880
I always knew I was different. 

00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:49.400
When I came out to my family, or “let them in” as I like to call it now,

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:52.200
there were some painful things said to me,  but they were all true.

00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:56.520
Painful things like I was always withdrawn, downer to be around.

00:03:57.240 --> 00:04:00.960
I accept who I am. And I am Leah. And I’ve always been Leah.

00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:08.040
- Some of the challenges of doing transgender care is fear.

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:12.760
Fear within the medical community that we're harming patients.

00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:20.720
Fear that we are hurting children or youth by disrupting their development.

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:25.240
And fear because we're actually changing the physiology of people.

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:29.520
- Since he was a teen, Dr. Makokis saw his Cree Two-Spirit identity

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:31.760
as part of who he was.

00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:34.560
But it was different for his husband, Anthony. 

00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:39.520
When they first met, he was still grappling with 
what it really meant to be Two-Spirit.

00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:46.200
As Indigenous people, we've always had gender diversity

00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:51.960
and sexual diversity in our Nations before colonization existed on Turtle Island.

00:04:54.560 --> 00:05:00.480
With the imposition of colonization, Christianity, 
residential schools, the Sixties Scoop,

00:05:00.480 --> 00:05:04.440
a lot of those teachings of gender diversity have been lost

00:05:04.440 --> 00:05:08.880
and a lot of people are searching 
for their identity as Two-Spirit people

00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:12.120
and the roles and responsibilities that come with that.

00:05:12.720 --> 00:05:13.440
- We're often like,

00:05:13.440 --> 00:05:15.280
“Oh man, what is it like not to be Native?”

00:05:15.280 --> 00:05:19.360
Because other people are talking about trips or nature or whatever.

00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:22.480
And we're like, talking about, you know, opioid crisis,

00:05:22.480 --> 00:05:28.880
We're talking about suicide, we’re talking about very difficult things 
that we deal with in our community.

00:05:29.160 --> 00:05:31.440
- By 4:30 in the afternoon,

00:05:31.440 --> 00:05:34.720
Dr. Makokis' schedule is only getting busier.

00:05:34.760 --> 00:05:41.280
He's on his way to the South Common Medical Center
for back-to-back appointments till 8 p.m.

00:05:41.280 --> 00:05:43.600
Alright, so here's our clinic at South Common.

00:05:43.600 --> 00:05:48.200
He's the only specialist who can prescribe hormones 
and other trans medicine there.

00:05:48.400 --> 00:05:51.200
So, we’re just gonna get settled in and then 
start seeing patients right away.

00:05:51.200 --> 00:05:54.600
So for him, the long hours are all worth it.

00:05:54.600 --> 00:05:57.800
– Remind me again, you've been on testosterone for ...

00:05:57.800 --> 00:05:59.720
– Almost three years now.

00:05:59.720 --> 00:06:01.040
– Yeah, three years.

00:06:01.040 --> 00:06:04.720
– And I first started seeing you when you were 11?
– Yeah.

00:06:04.720 --> 00:06:07.960
- Remembering my very first testosterone shot,

00:06:07.960 --> 00:06:10.640
it's almost like it happened yesterday.

00:06:10.640 --> 00:06:14.800
It solidified that I'm going to be here. 

00:06:14.800 --> 00:06:16.200
That gave me hope.

00:06:18.880 --> 00:06:22.880
– He [Emery] told us right after he turned 11, really nonchalantly.

00:06:22.920 --> 00:06:26.520
Of course, we reacted as it was normal and we’re expecting it.  

00:06:26.520 --> 00:06:28.680
Actually, he used the word “gender dysphoria,”

00:06:28.680 --> 00:06:30.160
which I had to look up afterwords.

00:06:36.680 --> 00:06:40.160
He wanted to be known as a boy, acknowledged as a boy.

00:06:40.160 --> 00:06:46.000
And he had a list of names for us to help him pick
to transition into becoming a man.

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:50.080
Emery was bullied from the ages of grade 1 to 4.

00:06:50.080 --> 00:06:54.480
And so he had serious bladder issues ‘cause 
the bullying happened in the bathroom.

00:06:54.480 --> 00:07:00.680
It took Dr. Makokis to advocate 
and really respond and acknowledge 

00:07:00.680 --> 00:07:07.600
that the physical issues my son had was a result 
of my son holding his bladder

00:07:07.600 --> 00:07:10.880
from bullying that happened for many years in a school.

00:07:13.120 --> 00:07:20.000
- Being Two-Spirit in my community means that I am fully who I am.

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:22.000
I'm not shy about that.

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:23.760
I don’t pretend to be someone else.

00:07:23.760 --> 00:07:26.880
Two-Spirit people are very gifted individuals 

00:07:26.880 --> 00:07:30.240
and they can do many different things

00:07:30.240 --> 00:07:32.880
if people don't stifle their growth and development.
