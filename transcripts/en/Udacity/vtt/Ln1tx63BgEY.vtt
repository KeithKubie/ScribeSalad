00:00:00.070 --> 00:00:03.830
So, it turns out that the relationship
between how much I would work and

00:00:03.830 --> 00:00:08.360
how much I would make can be described
with what's called a linear equation or

00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:10.310
the equation of a line.

00:00:10.310 --> 00:00:11.740
In this example,

00:00:11.740 --> 00:00:16.140
we would use maybe y to represent
the amount of money I'm going to make.

00:00:16.140 --> 00:00:20.440
And it turns out that this
was equal to 10 times x,

00:00:20.440 --> 00:00:22.840
where x is the number
of hours I would work.

00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:24.760
So even though these are just letters,
x and

00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:28.560
y, they represent hours worked and
money made.

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:30.220
But this is getting a little cluttered.

00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:32.670
Let's use a chart to
organize our thinking.

00:00:32.670 --> 00:00:35.570
And I'm going to organize my thinking
with what's called a t-chart,

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:36.980
which looks something like this.

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:39.960
And remember my equation y = 10x,

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:44.500
where y represents the money I make, and
x represents the number of hours worked.

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:48.820
Well, we've already seen that
if I work 5 hours, I make $50.

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:52.148
And if I work 10 hours, I make $100.

00:00:52.148 --> 00:00:54.590
And I could keep filling this chart out.

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:58.250
The interesting thing to note though is
that each row has two numbers in it and

00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:02.870
for the purposes of graphing I like to
write these numbers as an ordered pair

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:05.410
with the x value first and
then they y value.

00:01:05.410 --> 00:01:10.310
Notice they're separated by a comma and
they have parenthesis around them.

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:14.590
So if 5, 50 is the ordered pair
version of this information.

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:18.890
How would you write this row of
information as an ordered pair?

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:21.570
I've given you the comma and you just
have to enter in the two numbers.
