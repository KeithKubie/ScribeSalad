- [Narrator] We are the paradoxical ape.
Bipedal, naked large-brained. Long the

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:38.670
master of fire, tools and language. But
still trying to understand ourselves.

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:48.660
Aware that death is inevitable, yet filled
with optimism. We grow up slowly. We hand

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:56.150
down knowledge. We empathize and deceive.
We shape the future from our shared

00:00:56.150 --> 00:01:03.540
understanding of the past. CARTA brings
together experts from diverse disciplines

00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:11.360

we got here. An exploration made possible

- [Carol] What I'm going to do is either
it can be considered as a sobriety

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:07.540
checkpoint or something completely crazy,
but I've been given some might consider

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:11.890
the enviable task of talking about the
evolution of early human body form and

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:15.960
particularly in the context of
understanding shapes of everything from

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:21.400
the neck down associated with the origins
of genus Homo. Now we have this idea about

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:24.700
the transition from australopithecus to
Homo. When we look at australopith

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:29.300
skeletons we see they're different from
ours. They tend to be smaller in body

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:33.900
size, males are much, much larger than
females. We tend to see that they seemed

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:37.710
to have shorter lower limbs, longer upper
limbs. They have longer, more curved

00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:41.960
fingers and toes. They look pretty
different in body form and we have the

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:46.260
idea that to go from something like an
australopith to something like us involved

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:50.570
a series of changes that we see when we
make a comparison like this. And sure

00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:54.710
enough, when we look at some of the early
Homo erectus fossils like this beautiful

00:02:54.710 --> 00:02:59.250
Turkana boy from Kenya, he's about 1.6
million years old. We see that he also

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:03.600
seems to share some of those features of
the post cranial skeleton that we see in

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:07.450
humans and that he seems to have more
human-like limb proportions with longer

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:12.730
stronger legs, bigger lower limb joints,
smaller upper limbs, thinner body form. So

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:17.600
this transition has shaped our ideas about
what the adaptive changes would have been

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:21.930
to go from point A to point B. Because
after all, if we're trying to understand

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:26.130
why and how our genus evolved, we need to
know what changes happened. Did they

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:29.100
happen together? Did they happen as a
package, were some of the features

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:33.800
evolving at different times in different
places? Those are the data that we have to

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:37.650
come up with our ideas about why it all
happened. So when we look at something

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:42.120
like this, we see australopiths here. They
sort of had the stocky ape shape. They're

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:46.650
maybe living partly in the trees. And then
we have these more savanna-dwelling,

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:50.850
animals that may have been doing long
distance walking and running, using fancy

00:03:50.850 --> 00:03:55.950
pants stone tools, all kinds of things.
But in terms of the post cranial skeleton,

00:03:55.950 --> 00:03:59.720
some of the features that we think of with
this transition that fuels our adaptive

00:03:59.720 --> 00:04:04.500
ideas is have to do with changes in limb
proportions, changes in lower limb joint

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:09.700
size, changes in the shape of the torso,
changes in body size and dimorphism or

00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:13.380
difference between males and females. So
what I'd like to do today is take you

00:04:13.380 --> 00:04:16.850
through a little bit of the evidence we
have and there's only a little bit to talk

00:04:16.850 --> 00:04:22.140
about so I won't be up here very long, to
see first of all was australopithecus

00:04:22.140 --> 00:04:27.000
different from what we think of as Homo as
we thought. And I'm also going to talk a

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:30.750
little bit about what we have from the
earliest part of the Homo fossil record in

00:04:30.750 --> 00:04:34.340
the way of post cranial bones that may
tell us something about what was

00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:37.360
happening. So we'll start with
australopiths because that's the easy

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:41.490
part, we have more fossils. If you open up
any human evolution textbook you'll see a

00:04:41.490 --> 00:04:45.440
picture something like this where you look
at the body shape of the torso of

00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:49.370
australopithecus and you see this
reconstruction. This is based on fossils

00:04:49.370 --> 00:04:53.480
done 35 or 40 years ago. There are more
fossils that have come in to change our

00:04:53.480 --> 00:04:57.220
ideas a little bit. But you see, the
stocky anamode with this cone shaped rib

00:04:57.220 --> 00:05:01.260
cage. If you connect the dots there and
imagine the belly of this. Big belly, very

00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:05.380
stiff and immovable and this would shape
our ideas of locomotion and how these

00:05:05.380 --> 00:05:09.930
things moved around and maybe even
digestive biology and so forth. Well, we

00:05:09.930 --> 00:05:13.380
know from a whole lot of fossils that this
probably is no longer really an accurate

00:05:13.380 --> 00:05:17.430
way to look at things. We have a number of
different vertebral columns that show that

00:05:17.430 --> 00:05:21.630
the characteristic curvatures in the human
vertebral column that holds us upright

00:05:21.630 --> 00:05:25.430
were present in early australopithecus.
There are lots of vertebrae in the lower

00:05:25.430 --> 00:05:30.410
back so they can stand up fully upright.
So they're not that ape-like that way. And

00:05:30.410 --> 00:05:33.240
there are new fossils that are bringing
new bits of data and I'll show you one of

00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:37.400
those bits of data. This is a skeleton
called Kadanuumu, it means big man. It's

00:05:37.400 --> 00:05:42.060
an australopithecus male and he's nice and
big. And we're very excited, those of us

00:05:42.060 --> 00:05:45.490
who care about ribs are very excited
because it actually has some ribs. And you

00:05:45.490 --> 00:05:49.100
can measure the curvature of those ribs to
say something about what maybe the rib

00:05:49.100 --> 00:05:53.440
cage would have been like. And you see,
apes have this cone shaped rib cage of

00:05:53.440 --> 00:05:58.070
very sort of straight ribs. Humans' curve
around, give you this more slender barrel

00:05:58.070 --> 00:06:02.780
shape rib cage. You can measure this in
Kadanuumu and you can see it's right down

00:06:02.780 --> 00:06:07.360
here with humans and gibbons who also have
this rib cage shape. Very different from

00:06:07.360 --> 00:06:11.150
something we see in great apes and data
like these are giving us the picture that

00:06:11.150 --> 00:06:15.380
in fact the body shape of australopithecus
may not have been so different from our

00:06:15.380 --> 00:06:19.660
own as we had long thought. We also can
take a look at limb length. We have this

00:06:19.660 --> 00:06:23.610
idea that australophitecus has more
ape-like limb proportions, longer upper

00:06:23.610 --> 00:06:29.160
limbs, smaller lower limbs. Based partly
on good old Lucy here, Lucy is teeny tiny

00:06:29.160 --> 00:06:33.040
so this is lower limb to upper limb. You
can pretty much pick your favorite

00:06:33.040 --> 00:06:37.100
measure, it doesn't much matter. And you
can see that chimps and gorillas here have

00:06:37.100 --> 00:06:41.450
bigger upper limbs than humans for their
lower limb size and Lucy seemed to fit

00:06:41.450 --> 00:06:46.420
that picture. But new data like these ones
showed here again from Kadanuumu show that

00:06:46.420 --> 00:06:50.900
once you get larger and fat,
australopithecus don't really have very

00:06:50.900 --> 00:06:54.840
short legs. They maybe have longer arms,
but they don't really have short legs. And

00:06:54.840 --> 00:06:58.760
Trent Holiday and other people have done
similar analyses to suggest that maybe the

00:06:58.760 --> 00:07:01.920
lower limbs weren't that much shorter than
australopiths, they're just littler

00:07:01.920 --> 00:07:05.820
animals. So they may not be as big a
change in limb length from australopiths

00:07:05.820 --> 00:07:09.900
to Homo as we have thought. Another thing
we've learned recently comes from the

00:07:09.900 --> 00:07:14.090
foot. An ape has a foot with not just a
grasping big toe, but the whole thing is

00:07:14.090 --> 00:07:18.820
flexible, so it can wrap around branches
and hang on in the trees. Whereas our feet

00:07:18.820 --> 00:07:22.330
are very stiff and they form a nice
propulsive lever to move us forward when

00:07:22.330 --> 00:07:25.900
we walk on the ground on two feet, and
that propulsive lever is supported by

00:07:25.900 --> 00:07:29.880
arches that go from front to back and side
to side that are built into the structure

00:07:29.880 --> 00:07:33.690
of the bones of our foot. So one we lift
our heels off the ground, they stiffen up

00:07:33.690 --> 00:07:38.620
and they let us work well. We've known for
a long time from fossil footprints that

00:07:38.620 --> 00:07:43.720
australopithecus did not have a grasping
big toe. But recently, Bill Kimble and his

00:07:43.720 --> 00:07:48.180
colleagues found this bone from the middle
part of the foot, it's called a metatarsal

00:07:48.180 --> 00:07:52.600
and it shows us that the australopith
foot, just like what we see with maybe

00:07:52.600 --> 00:07:56.870
Homo habilis or Homo erectus, had nicely
developed arches from front to back and

00:07:56.870 --> 00:08:01.640
side to side, a fully modern human foot
really well adapted for long distance

00:08:01.640 --> 00:08:05.850
travel on the ground. So this isn't really
maybe as different as we would have

00:08:05.850 --> 00:08:09.710
thought a long time...or a number of years
ago as a difference between

00:08:09.710 --> 00:08:12.720
australopithecus and human. And if you
blow up an australopith to be about the

00:08:12.720 --> 00:08:17.280
same size you see this really fairly
human-like lower limb, fairly human like

00:08:17.280 --> 00:08:21.070
body shape, and some of the other
differences maybe a little bit less

00:08:21.070 --> 00:08:25.270
dramatic than we thought. So maybe this
transition isn't as dramatic as we thought

00:08:25.270 --> 00:08:31.560
from the australopith side. What can we
now say about early Homo? We have now 2.8

00:08:31.560 --> 00:08:36.160
million years ago we see the genus Homo
appear based on this jaw. That's only a

00:08:36.160 --> 00:08:40.830
couple of hundred thousand years after
Lucy was roaming Ethiopia and it's a long

00:08:40.830 --> 00:08:46.020
time ago, but it's just a jaw. I'm going
to talk about the post cranial fossils

00:08:46.020 --> 00:08:53.560
associated with the origin of Homo. Right,
I'm done now. Thank you, have a nice day.

00:08:53.560 --> 00:08:57.490
I'm out. So let's take a look at what we
actually have. We have quite a number

00:08:57.490 --> 00:09:01.180
starting around two million years ago.
There are a whole lot of isolated post

00:09:01.180 --> 00:09:05.810
cranial bones, bits of thigh and arm and
this and that and they're great. But

00:09:05.810 --> 00:09:10.500
without heads and teeth we can't tell what
species they belong to. So they're not as

00:09:10.500 --> 00:09:14.850
useful to us as we'd like. What about Homo
erectus? Well, when we find bones that are

00:09:14.850 --> 00:09:18.450
associated with the heads and teeth we can
tell what species they belong to. These

00:09:18.450 --> 00:09:21.870
are three skeletons and as you see as you
move over this way, I'm using the term

00:09:21.870 --> 00:09:26.850
pretty liberally, associated bones of Homo
erectus from the beautiful Turkana boy

00:09:26.850 --> 00:09:32.290
1808, 803 from Koobi Fora. But these are
all about a million and a half years ago.

00:09:32.290 --> 00:09:37.100
That's over a million years after the
origins of the genus. The Dmanisi fossils

00:09:37.100 --> 00:09:41.590
are a little bit older, 1.8, but that's
still a million years after the origin of

00:09:41.590 --> 00:09:47.230
the genus Homo. Well, what about the other
early Homo species, habilis and

00:09:47.230 --> 00:09:50.520
rudolfensis? These are the associated
skeletons we have for habilis. Looks a bit

00:09:50.520 --> 00:09:54.190
like they were hit with an artillery
barrage, somewhat underwhelming but

00:09:54.190 --> 00:09:59.220
they're a little bit older. Koobi 42.0,
Olduvai Gorge 1.8. There are some post

00:09:59.220 --> 00:10:04.040
crania from the type side of Homo habilis.
The association with actual habilis has

00:10:04.040 --> 00:10:07.850
been questioned by some people so they're
a little bit less certain in terms of

00:10:07.850 --> 00:10:12.610
their taxonomic assignments but they are
there too, so we have some of those. What

00:10:12.610 --> 00:10:21.060
about Homo rudolfensis post crania? That's
all we've got, right? We know absolutely

00:10:21.060 --> 00:10:26.140
nothing about its skeleton which is
unfortunate. And so this whole exercise is

00:10:26.140 --> 00:10:30.520
a bit like trying to squeeze blood from
turnips which either means it's really,

00:10:30.520 --> 00:10:34.410
really hard or it means I can make
anything up and there's no data to falsify

00:10:34.410 --> 00:10:38.930
it. That's all fine, too. But what can we
actually say about that supposed set of

00:10:38.930 --> 00:10:43.250
characters that may seem to have gone
together with the origin of Homo. Well, we

00:10:43.250 --> 00:10:46.560
can take a look at maybe body size and
Mark Rabowski and colleagues published

00:10:46.560 --> 00:10:50.580
some new body size estimates and is there
really a difference between australopiths

00:10:50.580 --> 00:10:54.580
and Homo? Well, when we look at
australopithecuses we see there's a pretty

00:10:54.580 --> 00:10:58.490
good range in body size. They're not
particularly large, they're all fairly

00:10:58.490 --> 00:11:04.220
similar. And when we look at Homo habilis
just a little bit more recent in time, we

00:11:04.220 --> 00:11:07.360
only have a couple of specimens but they
fall right in that australopith range; not

00:11:07.360 --> 00:11:11.390
particularly large. When we look at some
of these Homo erectus fossils that we know

00:11:11.390 --> 00:11:15.670
are Homo erectus, even the Dmanisi
sample's really about similar to

00:11:15.670 --> 00:11:19.310
australopithecus, you start to get a
little bit larger individuals but remember

00:11:19.310 --> 00:11:24.050
again this is 1.5 million years ago. This
isn't very early in the evolution of the

00:11:24.050 --> 00:11:28.030
genus. And so maybe we're saying, "Ah,
here's one that's trended increasing body

00:11:28.030 --> 00:11:32.770
size happens." But we can look at the size
of some of these isolated fossils and

00:11:32.770 --> 00:11:37.740
here's a fossil I'm going to talk about a
bit. It's a partial pelvis called 3228. It

00:11:37.740 --> 00:11:41.790
was from somebody who is about as big as
the Turkana boy and it was 1.9 million

00:11:41.790 --> 00:11:45.990
years ago. So what can we say about this?
There doesn't seem to be a great trend in

00:11:45.990 --> 00:11:51.440
early evolution of Homo in either range of
body sizes or absolute body sizes. So

00:11:51.440 --> 00:11:55.430
we're not seeing anything really dramatic
happening early in the origin of the genus

00:11:55.430 --> 00:11:59.820
with body size and dimorphism. Well, what
about limb proportions and body build?

00:11:59.820 --> 00:12:02.990
Well, when you're looking at the oldest
things like habilis it's a little hard to

00:12:02.990 --> 00:12:06.960
do limb proportions when they're pretty
fragmentary. But what Chris Russell was

00:12:06.960 --> 00:12:10.620
able to do is instead of looking at bone
length he was able to look at the bone

00:12:10.620 --> 00:12:15.050
strength. And if you compare it to chimp,
you take the leg to the arm here and you

00:12:15.050 --> 00:12:19.040
see they're pretty similar in strength.
They plot out about like this. Humans, the

00:12:19.040 --> 00:12:23.420
lower limbs are stronger than the upper
limbs so they plot out up here. And he was

00:12:23.420 --> 00:12:28.180
able to take these measurements for at
least the OH 62, the one in black here,

00:12:28.180 --> 00:12:31.590
and put them on the graph with some Homo
erectuses and what you see is these two

00:12:31.590 --> 00:12:36.440
Homo erectus skeletons are very human-like
in their strength proportions, but Homo

00:12:36.440 --> 00:12:40.600
habilis is not. Homo habilis seems to have
a different build. And actually when you

00:12:40.600 --> 00:12:44.670
take the very few measurements you could
take on this scrappy specimen, it also

00:12:44.670 --> 00:12:48.470
seems to have a little bit larger upper
limbs relative to lower limbs than we tend

00:12:48.470 --> 00:12:52.550
to see in humans and maybe in these Homo
erectus. The Dmanisi sample,

00:12:52.550 --> 00:12:55.290
interestingly, doesn't seem to have the
sort of proportions. It seems to be more

00:12:55.290 --> 00:12:59.110
like the erectus although the same studies
haven't been done. So there seems to be

00:12:59.110 --> 00:13:03.160
some sort of a difference here between
habilis and erectus perhaps in body

00:13:03.160 --> 00:13:07.730
proportion, given how fragmentary the
fossil evidence is. This is an interesting

00:13:07.730 --> 00:13:12.610
fossil I want to mention because Meave
Leakey and her colleagues found this in

00:13:12.610 --> 00:13:16.190
2009, actually fit on this bit was found
in 1980 which is kind of cool. And it's

00:13:16.190 --> 00:13:21.160
associated piece of pelvis and femur, but
this captures the hip joint. And the hip

00:13:21.160 --> 00:13:24.990
joint is interesting partly because we
have a bunch of them in the fossil record

00:13:24.990 --> 00:13:28.900
but partly because the hip joint seems to
be a place that there isn't a lot of

00:13:28.900 --> 00:13:34.830
difference among these early Homo species
as best we can say. Here's the 3228 pelvis

00:13:34.830 --> 00:13:39.950
again. In this pelvis shows a series of
features that we only see in humans, we

00:13:39.950 --> 00:13:45.170
never see in australopithecus, so it's not
a bad hypothesis for a Homo. These two are

00:13:45.170 --> 00:13:50.070
almost dead ringers for one another but
this one is just much smaller. So either

00:13:50.070 --> 00:13:54.150
these are a male and female of a really
dimorphic species or they're two species

00:13:54.150 --> 00:13:57.900
that happen to look the same. But they're
both 1.9 million years old so they're nice

00:13:57.900 --> 00:14:03.970
and early. Well, when we look at those
Homo-like features, we see them in this

00:14:03.970 --> 00:14:07.760
5881, pardon me, this new specimen here.
So here's Lucy and you look at the front

00:14:07.760 --> 00:14:12.500
border of the ileum, part of the pelvis
it's straight and every australopith we

00:14:12.500 --> 00:14:18.310
have is bent in every Homo that we have
and it's bent in 5881. When we look at the

00:14:18.310 --> 00:14:22.350
ileum from the side you could see this
buttress called the iliac pillar here is

00:14:22.350 --> 00:14:26.520
more vertical and set back from the edge
of the bone and it's big. In the Homo

00:14:26.520 --> 00:14:30.990
pelvises, it's very weak in every
australopith and angled right into the

00:14:30.990 --> 00:14:35.550
front of the bone. In 5881 here is looking
like Homo. So this looks kind of like a

00:14:35.550 --> 00:14:39.650
Homo sort of a creature. When we look at
the other side of the hip joint at the

00:14:39.650 --> 00:14:43.780
proximal femur, every time you see an
australopith that has a relatively small

00:14:43.780 --> 00:14:47.740
femural head. So relatively small hip
joint. You see that in the pelvis too,

00:14:47.740 --> 00:14:52.560
where Homo, including modern humans, have
a much a larger femural head. 5881 needs a

00:14:52.560 --> 00:14:56.480
little bit of digital reconstruction which
you can do actually for quite accurately

00:14:56.480 --> 00:15:00.670
using CAD software, it also would have had
a large femural head, and we can see them

00:15:00.670 --> 00:15:05.170
in the pelvis too. And it's interesting
that every femur we have that seems to be

00:15:05.170 --> 00:15:10.900
Homo, attributed or not, has a big femural
head. In every australopithecus we have

00:15:10.900 --> 00:15:15.020
which is associated with post cranials has
a small one. So this seems to be a feature

00:15:15.020 --> 00:15:20.170
that characterize all Homo, not related
perhaps to body proportions. So changes in

00:15:20.170 --> 00:15:25.640
body proportion, change in hip joint size
don't seem to co-occur in early Homo.

00:15:25.640 --> 00:15:29.940
Well, again, squeezing blood out of more
turnips here, we can come back to our bone

00:15:29.940 --> 00:15:34.110
cross sectional shape. And this is more
work by Chris Ruff Mosley, so you can take

00:15:34.110 --> 00:15:37.790
a femur, you can slice it open in the
middle and you can look at these sections.

00:15:37.790 --> 00:15:42.130
And everything we have that we know or
suspect is Home erectus, actual Homo

00:15:42.130 --> 00:15:48.830
erectus that we have data for has this mid
shaft femur is very wide from side to side

00:15:48.830 --> 00:15:52.640
and short from front to back. And it has a
really indistinct marking on the back of

00:15:52.640 --> 00:15:57.370
the femur for attachment of muscles. When
you put Homo habilis on there, it's a very

00:15:57.370 --> 00:16:03.020
different shape; rounder and it's longer
from front to back. 5881 is a dead ringer

00:16:03.020 --> 00:16:08.120
for OH 62 in this feature and they both
also have this big, thick attachment here

00:16:08.120 --> 00:16:13.020
for those thigh muscles. So, ah, you say,
maybe this is Homo habilis, maybe 5881 is

00:16:13.020 --> 00:16:17.430
habilis, that's great. But if you put data
that Phil Whitemyer kindly lent me from

00:16:17.430 --> 00:16:23.390
the Dmanisi skeletons, they are actually
shaped like the habilis also. Now either

00:16:23.390 --> 00:16:26.830
this says that Dmanisi is not Homo erectus
which I really wouldn't want to say based

00:16:26.830 --> 00:16:32.360
on one character here, or something else
is going on. Chris Roth's idea about the

00:16:32.360 --> 00:16:37.250
explanation for these differences is that
in Homo erectus, when the pelvis gets

00:16:37.250 --> 00:16:41.530
bigger to accommodate larger brains, the
whole body gets wider and that puts more

00:16:41.530 --> 00:16:46.690
medialateral bending stresses on the bone
and so they're wider to accommodate that.

00:16:46.690 --> 00:16:50.790
So that this shape would indicate a
narrower body form than this shape. Well,

00:16:50.790 --> 00:16:57.590
we can look at little bit of pelvic shape
and turn 5881. You can take this curvature

00:16:57.590 --> 00:17:00.460
here which gives you a little bit of an
idea of the inlet. You could see

00:17:00.460 --> 00:17:04.750
australopithecus very wide, a little wider
in Homo erectus and then these are later

00:17:04.750 --> 00:17:09.950
Homo things, but 5881 it seems to be
narrower, which seems to fit with Chris'

00:17:09.950 --> 00:17:14.990
hypothesis about the explanation for the
femural bone shapes. In which case,

00:17:14.990 --> 00:17:18.770
perhaps then, Dmanisi may have had a
narrower shape than we see in East African

00:17:18.770 --> 00:17:23.230
Homo erectus. Does this mean it's not Homo
erectus? It's hard to say. Remember that

00:17:23.230 --> 00:17:28.560
Dmanisi individuals are 300,000 years
older than the Homo erectus individuals I

00:17:28.560 --> 00:17:31.860
have on this graph. That's a long time.
Think about what happened in the

00:17:31.860 --> 00:17:35.430
neanderthals and humans in the last 50,000
or 100,000 years. So this could be

00:17:35.430 --> 00:17:39.310
something happening through time. It could
be species related. It's very hard to say

00:17:39.310 --> 00:17:43.830
given how scrappy the fossil evidence is.
But it does say that some of these

00:17:43.830 --> 00:17:48.350
characters aren't necessarily co-varying
and there seem to be different morphotypes

00:17:48.350 --> 00:17:52.430
within the genus Homo. All Homo doesn't
look like all the other Homo from the neck

00:17:52.430 --> 00:17:56.210
down. And that's an important factor to
think about when we then constructing our

00:17:56.210 --> 00:18:00.690
adaptive explanations for what's going on
in this transition from australopithecus

00:18:00.690 --> 00:18:06.530
to Homo. So we have these creatures that
may be not quite as stocky as we thought.

00:18:06.530 --> 00:18:11.270
The lower limbs may have been much better
adapted for decent amounts or quality of

00:18:11.270 --> 00:18:15.230
travel while on the ground, and they may
not have been as ape like as we've

00:18:15.230 --> 00:18:20.310
previously thought with australopithecus.
When we look at the earliest Homo, we may

00:18:20.310 --> 00:18:24.720
see at least some that may have even more
apey limb proportions than we see in

00:18:24.720 --> 00:18:29.300
australopithecus. We see that the
combination of features of having larger

00:18:29.300 --> 00:18:34.190
lower limb joints, of having larger limb
joints, longer lower limbs don't

00:18:34.190 --> 00:18:38.420
necessarily co-vary. Limbs were already
long, hip joints may have been gotten big

00:18:38.420 --> 00:18:41.990
at the beginning of Homo, it's hard to
say. Body form may have evolved

00:18:41.990 --> 00:18:46.320
differently in different species and/or at
different times. But we no longer have

00:18:46.320 --> 00:18:51.140
this idea of one change associated with
the origin of the genus. And these well

00:18:51.140 --> 00:18:54.890
adapted features that we see here that
make this complex, that make Homo erectus

00:18:54.890 --> 00:18:58.790
great that do things like hunting and tool
using and everything later, may be

00:18:58.790 --> 00:19:02.550
something that weren't associated with the
origin of the genus but came in much

00:19:02.550 --> 00:19:07.330
later. So in fact, if we compare
australopithecus to earliest Homo, this

00:19:07.330 --> 00:19:11.550
might be a more reasonable picture to have
in our mind. Animals that weren't really

00:19:11.550 --> 00:19:15.810
very different especially from the neck
down, weren't really different in

00:19:15.810 --> 00:19:20.190
locomotor capabilities. If I had more
reconstructions of different Homo species

00:19:20.190 --> 00:19:24.040
you might have seen them look a little bit
different from one another. But basically,

00:19:24.040 --> 00:19:29.580
the picture is that there's not a dramatic
change here in the origin of Homo that has

00:19:29.580 --> 00:19:33.720
anything to do with the post cranial
skeleton. Perhaps the adaptive changes

00:19:33.720 --> 00:19:37.860
associated with the origin of the genus
had to do more with diet, other behaviors

00:19:37.860 --> 00:19:43.170
or something else. And that's what we need
to be thinking that what happened to the

00:19:43.170 --> 00:19:46.020
origin of Homo that gave rise to all the
other great things that we've been hearing

00:19:46.020 --> 00:19:48.910
about today. I say thank you.
