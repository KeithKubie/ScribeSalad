00:00:01.100 --> 00:00:02.535
Ah. Grant.

00:00:02.568 --> 00:00:03.569
I think I know what
you're here to say.

00:00:03.603 --> 00:00:05.171
I've been spending
a lot of time with Beyoncé.

00:00:05.204 --> 00:00:07.573
And this is not a review
of having a pet.

00:00:07.606 --> 00:00:09.776
It's a review of putting
a pet to sleep.

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:12.045
That is what
I was going to say.

00:00:12.078 --> 00:00:14.480
I feel like you're falling
for this lizard

00:00:14.513 --> 00:00:16.416
and forgetting
what you have it for.

00:00:16.449 --> 00:00:19.118
Uh, no. [Laughs]
Come on, Grant.

00:00:19.151 --> 00:00:21.654
I'm not capable of falling
for anything except "Review."

00:00:21.687 --> 00:00:23.489
Now, having said that,

00:00:23.522 --> 00:00:25.658
I will not be
euthanizing Beyoncé.

00:00:25.691 --> 00:00:27.126
Forrest.
No.

00:00:27.159 --> 00:00:28.828
This is no regular
dime store lizard, Grant.

00:00:28.861 --> 00:00:30.463
He just returned
from the brink of death.

00:00:30.496 --> 00:00:32.065
Does that sound familiar?

00:00:32.098 --> 00:00:33.199
That happened to you
and me too, right?

00:00:33.233 --> 00:00:35.368
You relate to him, don't you?
I've gotten to know him.

00:00:35.401 --> 00:00:38.504
And he's actually
extremely intelligent.

00:00:38.537 --> 00:00:40.540
I mean, it's like,
there's a lot going on up there.

00:00:40.573 --> 00:00:41.741
So it would be a crime.

00:00:41.774 --> 00:00:44.477
Which is why I
have purchased --

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:46.345
aha! --

00:00:46.378 --> 00:00:50.383
another pet for the express
purpose of keeping

00:00:50.416 --> 00:00:52.285
for a couple of days
and then killing.

00:00:52.318 --> 00:00:54.854
I'm gonna kill that one instead.
I named him Deyoncé.

00:00:54.887 --> 00:00:56.489
Take a look.
Here you go.

00:00:56.522 --> 00:01:00.393
Beyoncé and Deyoncé.

00:01:00.426 --> 00:01:03.396
Friends for
1 or 2 days tops.

00:01:03.429 --> 00:01:06.466
And then, that one,
I'm gonna kill.

00:01:06.499 --> 00:01:09.368
That sounds fine.

00:01:09.401 --> 00:01:12.171
Good.
Yeah.

00:01:12.204 --> 00:01:14.707
Since any animal at all would do
for this assignment,

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:16.442
I felt I'd found a good way

00:01:16.475 --> 00:01:19.245
to spare the life of a creature
with whom I had perhaps

00:01:19.278 --> 00:01:21.814
developed some kind of
mutual respect.

00:01:21.847 --> 00:01:25.585
But there was a terrible
flaw in my plan.

00:01:25.618 --> 00:01:26.786
Forrest:
The picture is good,

00:01:26.819 --> 00:01:28.387
but I wish it could
look more old-timey.

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:29.722
You know how old-timey
paper was all yellow, and --

00:01:29.755 --> 00:01:31.691
Yes! Just like that!
Oh, that's perfect!

00:01:31.724 --> 00:01:32.692
Okay.

00:01:32.725 --> 00:01:34.460
[ Laughs ] Whoa.
Where's Beyoncé?

00:01:34.493 --> 00:01:35.761
Josh: Isn't that Beyoncé?

00:01:35.794 --> 00:01:37.697
No, this is my
new lizard, Deyoncé.

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:40.399
Whoa!
Where's Beyoncé?

00:01:40.432 --> 00:01:41.801
Wait, did you 'em
in there together?

00:01:41.834 --> 00:01:43.603
Yeah, why?

00:01:43.636 --> 00:01:46.205
You shouldn't put two bearded
dragons in the same tank.

00:01:46.238 --> 00:01:48.274
Why not?
Is that Beyoncé's foot?

00:01:48.307 --> 00:01:49.509
Oh!
Okay.

00:01:49.542 --> 00:01:51.377
Oh, no!
What happened?!

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:53.779
Yeah, sometimes they eat
each other. It's crazy.

00:01:53.812 --> 00:01:55.414
What the [bleep]
are you talking about?!

00:01:55.447 --> 00:01:56.682
I knew that.
There's videos on YouTube --

00:01:56.715 --> 00:01:57.917
What the [bleep]
are you talking about?!

00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:59.719
These [bleep] lizards
eat each other?!

00:01:59.752 --> 00:02:01.220
Oh, so we both knew that.

00:02:01.253 --> 00:02:02.321
Why the [bleep]
didn't you tell me that?!

00:02:02.354 --> 00:02:03.589
Oh, I thought
we all knew that.

00:02:03.622 --> 00:02:05.391
I put them both
in the same thing,

00:02:05.424 --> 00:02:06.926
and one of them
ate the other one?!

00:02:06.959 --> 00:02:11.464
[ Breathing heavily ]

00:02:11.497 --> 00:02:13.766
Well, I deal
with grief alone.

[ Sobbing ]

00:02:16.902 --> 00:02:19.405
Maybe he's in the cave?
Josh.

00:02:19.438 --> 00:02:20.606
Yeah, okay.
All right.

00:02:20.639 --> 00:02:23.910
I looked in
the [bleep] cave!

00:02:23.943 --> 00:02:26.245
Forrest: I had no emotional
attachment to Beyoncé

00:02:26.278 --> 00:02:28.314
and was not sad for myself.

00:02:28.347 --> 00:02:30.783
But the injustice of what
had happened troubled me.

00:02:30.816 --> 00:02:33.620
[ Sobbing ] My only friend
in the world!

00:02:35.521 --> 00:02:38.724

00:02:45.631 --> 00:02:50.469
I'm so sorry.
I'm so sorry.

00:02:50.502 --> 00:02:52.638
After a period of reflection,

00:02:52.671 --> 00:02:54.907
I decided that I had
bonded enough with Deyoncé

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:58.377
to have a genuine experience
of putting him to sleep.

00:02:58.410 --> 00:03:00.380
You're comin' with me,
you piece of shit.

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:07.653
My experience of putting Deyoncé
to sleep was, frankly,

00:03:07.686 --> 00:03:09.922
more like pet
capital punishment.

00:03:09.955 --> 00:03:11.390
It was justice.

00:03:11.423 --> 00:03:13.726
Regrettable,
but completely necessary.
