00:00:00.459 --> 00:00:02.210
- [Voiceover] Which of
the following functions

00:00:02.210 --> 00:00:05.210
are continuous for all real numbers?

00:00:07.401 --> 00:00:08.834
So let's just remind ourselves

00:00:08.834 --> 00:00:10.518
what it means to be continuous.

00:00:10.518 --> 00:00:13.512
What a continuous function looks like.

00:00:13.512 --> 00:00:15.176
So, a continuous function,

00:00:15.176 --> 00:00:17.425
let's see, that's my y-axis,

00:00:17.425 --> 00:00:19.678
that is my x-axis.

00:00:19.678 --> 00:00:22.423
A function is going to be
continuous over some interval.

00:00:22.423 --> 00:00:23.256
If it just has,

00:00:23.256 --> 00:00:26.831
doesn't have any jumps or discontinuities

00:00:26.831 --> 00:00:29.300
over that, or gaps over that interval,

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:31.024
so if it's connected

00:00:31.024 --> 00:00:33.721
and it for sure has to be
defined over that interval

00:00:33.721 --> 00:00:35.259
without any gaps,

00:00:35.259 --> 00:00:36.092
so for example,

00:00:36.092 --> 00:00:40.259
a continuous function could
look something like this.

00:00:41.727 --> 00:00:42.630
This function,

00:00:42.630 --> 00:00:44.810
let me make that line
a little bit thicker,

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:47.888
so this function right
over here is continuous.

00:00:47.888 --> 00:00:50.226
It is connected over this interval,

00:00:50.226 --> 00:00:51.526
the interval that we can see.

00:00:51.526 --> 00:00:53.899
Now, examples of discontinuous functions

00:00:53.899 --> 00:00:56.425
over an interval, or
non-continuous functions,

00:00:56.425 --> 00:00:58.223
well, they would have gaps of some kind.

00:00:58.223 --> 00:01:01.712
They could have some type of
an asymptotic discontinuity

00:01:01.712 --> 00:01:03.749
so something like that,

00:01:03.749 --> 00:01:06.495
that makes it discontinuous.

00:01:06.495 --> 00:01:08.122
They could have

00:01:08.122 --> 00:01:09.516
a jump of discontinuity,

00:01:09.516 --> 00:01:11.183
something like that.

00:01:12.416 --> 00:01:13.880
They could just have a gap

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:16.047
where they're not defined,

00:01:17.044 --> 00:01:19.989
so they could have a gap
where they're not defined,

00:01:19.989 --> 00:01:22.845
or maybe they actually are defined there,

00:01:22.845 --> 00:01:25.573
but it's removable discontinuity,

00:01:25.573 --> 00:01:28.761
so all of these are examples
of discontinuous functions.

00:01:28.761 --> 00:01:31.492
Now, if you want the more
mathy understanding of that

00:01:31.492 --> 00:01:32.988
and we've looked at this before,

00:01:32.988 --> 00:01:36.238
we say that a function f is continuous,

00:01:37.122 --> 00:01:38.622
continuous at some

00:01:39.873 --> 00:01:41.556
value, x equals a,

00:01:41.556 --> 00:01:42.940
if and only if,

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:44.626
draw my little two-way arrows here,

00:01:44.626 --> 00:01:47.640
say if and only if the limit

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:50.390
of f of x as x approaches a

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:55.573
is equal to the value
of the function at a,

00:01:55.573 --> 00:01:57.661
so once again, in order
to be continuous there,

00:01:57.661 --> 00:02:00.590
you at least have to be defined there.

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:02.439
Now, when you look at these,
the one thing that jumps out

00:02:02.439 --> 00:02:04.182
at me, in order to be
continuous for all real numbers,

00:02:04.182 --> 00:02:05.929
you have to be defined
for all real numbers

00:02:05.929 --> 00:02:08.772
and g of x is not defined
for all real numbers.

00:02:08.772 --> 00:02:11.857
It's not defined for negative values of x,

00:02:11.857 --> 00:02:13.190
and so, we would

00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:16.282
rule this one out,

00:02:16.282 --> 00:02:19.317
so let's think about f
of x equals e to the x.

00:02:19.317 --> 00:02:22.234
It is defined for all real numbers,

00:02:23.439 --> 00:02:24.604
and as we'll see,

00:02:24.604 --> 00:02:27.349
most of the common functions
that you've learned in math,

00:02:27.349 --> 00:02:30.020
they don't have these
strange jumps or gaps

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:31.007
or discontinuities.

00:02:31.007 --> 00:02:32.415
Some of them do,

00:02:32.415 --> 00:02:34.104
functions like 1 over x

00:02:34.104 --> 00:02:36.020
and things like that,

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:39.210
but things like e to the x,
it doesn't have any of those.

00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:40.568
We could graph e to the x.

00:02:40.568 --> 00:02:42.850
E to the x looks something like,

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:45.228
e to the x looks something like this,

00:02:45.228 --> 00:02:47.009
it's defined for all real numbers,

00:02:47.009 --> 00:02:50.182
there's no jumps or gaps of any kind

00:02:50.182 --> 00:02:51.384
and so,

00:02:51.384 --> 00:02:54.276
this f of x is continuous

00:02:54.276 --> 00:02:55.732
for all real numbers

00:02:55.732 --> 00:02:57.307
and f only.

00:02:57.307 --> 00:02:59.226
Now, I didn't do a very rigorous proof.

00:02:59.226 --> 00:03:00.816
You could if you like,

00:03:00.816 --> 00:03:02.809
but for the sake of this exercise,

00:03:02.809 --> 00:03:04.499
it's really more of getting
this intuitive sense

00:03:04.499 --> 00:03:07.499
of like, look, e to the x is
defined for all real numbers

00:03:07.499 --> 00:03:09.139
and so,

00:03:09.139 --> 00:03:11.202
and there's no jumps or gaps here

00:03:11.202 --> 00:03:12.648
so it's reasonable to
say that it's continuous

00:03:12.648 --> 00:03:14.548
but you could do a more
rigorous proof if you like

00:03:14.548 --> 00:03:15.381
as well.
