[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:06.040 --> 00:00:08.200
CHERYL SUCHORS:
Once upon a time,

00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:15.030
in 1998, I vowed to
climb 48 mountains.

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:18.670
And what I'd like to do for
the next 40 minutes or so

00:00:18.670 --> 00:00:21.550
is share a little of
my journey with you.

00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:25.690
I'll make some remarks,
read three short passages

00:00:25.690 --> 00:00:30.670
from my book, offer some
thoughts about mental training,

00:00:30.670 --> 00:00:35.230
and leave us with time for
question and discussion.

00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:36.726
You game?

00:00:36.726 --> 00:00:39.590
All right.

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:43.870
Now, if you had known
me back in 1998,

00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:48.760
you might have thought
this vow was questionable.

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:52.090
I had a bum knee.

00:00:52.090 --> 00:00:55.150
I have scoliosis
that is severe enough

00:00:55.150 --> 00:00:57.250
that one doctor, when
I was in my teens,

00:00:57.250 --> 00:01:01.075
said don't ever pick up
anything heavier than a tissue.

00:01:01.075 --> 00:01:04.690
I was no longer in
my 20s or my 30s.

00:01:04.690 --> 00:01:07.510
I was 48.

00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:11.290
And my record with
sports was not promising.

00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:13.540
I had tried and
loved three of them,

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:16.810
and had to give each of them
up when my body failed me,

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:20.830
twice ending with surgery.

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:24.920
And lastly, though
I hate to admit it,

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:27.640
I'm afraid of heights.

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:31.780
Nonetheless, this is
what I decided to climb,

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:36.700
Mount Tripyramid in the White
Mountains of New Hampshire.

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:39.025
All three peaks of it.

00:01:39.025 --> 00:01:43.530
It was going to be a
serious challenge for me.

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:45.790
It was two and a
half times as long

00:01:45.790 --> 00:01:52.020
as I'd ever hiked back in the
day, on much easier trails.

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:56.080
It was one of the taller
ones in the Whites.

00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:59.080
It was cold that
day in early October

00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:01.880
when we decided to go for it.

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:05.550
And it was going to take
pretty much all day.

00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:08.680
Book time doesn't
even include things

00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:13.960
like lunch or bio breaks or
picture-taking or view-enjoying

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:16.720
or pretty much anything.

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:19.970
Along with me on this
venture I invited Kate,

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:23.120
to my next-door neighbor
and my best friend.

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:25.810
We did pretty much
everything together.

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:28.450
She was my daughter's
Auntie Kate.

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:32.080
She was my dog's Auntie Kate.

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:37.090
I also invited Sarah, my
best friend from college.

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:39.850
Now, Sarah and I
were the same age,

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:42.010
but Kate was six years older.

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:45.770
So she was 54 when we started.

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:48.040
And it's kind of fitting
that I introduce you

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:52.060
early on to a couple of friends,
because among the themes

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:55.890
in my book, friendship
is certainly one.

00:02:55.890 --> 00:02:59.740
Now, one thing that
I did not appreciate

00:02:59.740 --> 00:03:02.380
before I went on the
Mount Tripyramid hike

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:04.000
was its elevation gain.

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:07.040
I was kind of like, meh.

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:10.360
Now I've come to
think of it like this.

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:14.360
Picture for yourselves a
two-story house with an attic.

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:15.420
All right?

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:17.440
Put another one just
like it next door.

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:21.280
Pick up the second one, put
it on top of the first one,

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:24.460
and keep going.

00:03:24.460 --> 00:03:28.780
You need to add up
100 houses to reach

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:30.790
3,000 feet of elevation gain.

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:34.690
And we'd be doing
that on rocky, rooty,

00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:37.345
ankle-busting,
knee-turning trails.

00:03:39.915 --> 00:03:43.600
And I'm here to tell
you, it was hard.

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:47.070
We were on the Scaur Ridge
Trail, the three of us,

00:03:47.070 --> 00:03:51.510
climbing up on our hands
and knees over boulders.

00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:55.160
I did not expect that at all.

00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:58.710
And I was starting to
get really worried.

00:03:58.710 --> 00:04:01.350
I was getting anxious
that I wouldn't

00:04:01.350 --> 00:04:03.720
be able to make it
to the top and I

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:06.120
wouldn't be able to
finish this event that

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:08.520
was so important to me.

00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:11.670
I'd like to read you
a couple of paragraphs

00:04:11.670 --> 00:04:17.250
so that you get a glimpse of
why finishing was so important.

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:19.860
After months of
preparing for this hike,

00:04:19.860 --> 00:04:23.550
I still didn't know if I was
strong enough, tough enough,

00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:25.460
brave enough.

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:30.030
As it had during the night,
worry eroded my confidence.

00:04:30.030 --> 00:04:31.980
Would I finish?

00:04:31.980 --> 00:04:37.380
Other possible problems--
storms, rutting moose, bears--

00:04:37.380 --> 00:04:40.500
I didn't have the experience
to be troubled by.

00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:43.160
It was me that worried me.

00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:45.810
We continued leveraging
and hoisting,

00:04:45.810 --> 00:04:47.490
maintaining the
lineup that would

00:04:47.490 --> 00:04:49.803
continue for much of the day--

00:04:49.803 --> 00:04:52.460
Sarah in the lead,
me in the middle,

00:04:52.460 --> 00:04:56.670
and Kate slowly, and with
no apparent angst about it,

00:04:56.670 --> 00:04:58.310
bringing up the rear.

00:04:58.310 --> 00:05:01.770
Kate's face was
sweaty but determined.

00:05:01.770 --> 00:05:07.590
I thought, she really
is stronger than I am.

00:05:07.590 --> 00:05:10.260
Not as fast, but stronger.

00:05:10.260 --> 00:05:16.080
At some core level, she
seemed unfazed by this trail.

00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:20.445
Sarah was fast, and Kate
was sure, but what was I?

00:05:20.445 --> 00:05:23.310
I no longer defined
myself as a partner

00:05:23.310 --> 00:05:27.330
in a national organization or
president of my own consulting

00:05:27.330 --> 00:05:32.520
firm, and I could hardly
call myself a writer.

00:05:32.520 --> 00:05:37.770
I needed to be a
hiker, a good one.

00:05:37.770 --> 00:05:41.370
But I relied on a blend
of fear and willpower,

00:05:41.370 --> 00:05:46.690
with neither Sarah's agility
nor Kate's character.

00:05:46.690 --> 00:05:49.230
So now you understand
that I was in the middle

00:05:49.230 --> 00:05:53.040
of a late mid-career change
from the world of business

00:05:53.040 --> 00:05:57.270
to following my bliss,
something I'd always

00:05:57.270 --> 00:06:00.930
wanted to do since
childhood, to write a novel.

00:06:00.930 --> 00:06:04.680
And it was not going well.

00:06:04.680 --> 00:06:10.800
So there I am on the
trail, anxious, worried,

00:06:10.800 --> 00:06:14.370
concerned I was never
going to finish,

00:06:14.370 --> 00:06:16.420
when something happened.

00:06:16.420 --> 00:06:20.310
Kate, who was
behind me, called up

00:06:20.310 --> 00:06:25.450
and motioned me to come over
to see something, which I did.

00:06:25.450 --> 00:06:30.030
And when I went back down,
this is what I found.

00:06:30.030 --> 00:06:33.330
Kate unzipped the small
pouch belted at her navel

00:06:33.330 --> 00:06:35.670
and pulled out a camera.

00:06:35.670 --> 00:06:38.370
Moving to her side, I
leaned down to where

00:06:38.370 --> 00:06:40.480
she crouched on the trail.

00:06:40.480 --> 00:06:45.540
She pointed out a whole row of
icicles hanging from a boulder

00:06:45.540 --> 00:06:46.860
to our right.

00:06:46.860 --> 00:06:51.150
They glistened, wetly
silver against a backdrop

00:06:51.150 --> 00:06:53.410
of emerald moss.

00:06:53.410 --> 00:06:58.770
Wow, I whispered, as Kate
moved in for a close-up.

00:06:58.770 --> 00:07:01.380
I pulled off a glove
and reached out

00:07:01.380 --> 00:07:06.150
to slide my finger down one of
the six-inch sparkling daggers,

00:07:06.150 --> 00:07:09.990
cold, slick, solid.

00:07:09.990 --> 00:07:13.020
I yearned to break
one off and lick it,

00:07:13.020 --> 00:07:15.420
but they were too
beautiful to ruin.

00:07:15.420 --> 00:07:18.720
I remembered my mother
coming into my childhood

00:07:18.720 --> 00:07:24.000
room in the early-morning dark
to murmur, it's a snow day.

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:27.360
The exhilaration,
the sense of freedom,

00:07:27.360 --> 00:07:33.090
a day in the white glare of
snow making lopsided snowballs

00:07:33.090 --> 00:07:38.040
and forts, plucking icicles
from tree branches until I grew

00:07:38.040 --> 00:07:38.910
chilled.

00:07:38.910 --> 00:07:40.830
Then the warmth
inside the house that

00:07:40.830 --> 00:07:45.240
fogged my glasses, my mother
pressing her warm cheek

00:07:45.240 --> 00:07:50.850
to my cold one, saying this was
her favorite moment of winter,

00:07:50.850 --> 00:07:55.080
offering her a bit of icicle
that still clung to my mitten.

00:07:55.080 --> 00:08:00.030
The taste, gritty,
with bits of bark

00:08:00.030 --> 00:08:04.410
and the strange
bloody tang of dirt.

00:08:04.410 --> 00:08:07.240
Perhaps Kate was
remembering, too.

00:08:07.240 --> 00:08:09.960
Aren't they amazing?

00:08:09.960 --> 00:08:12.240
I looked at her, and
she looked at me,

00:08:12.240 --> 00:08:15.050
and it settled into my
brain that we were here

00:08:15.050 --> 00:08:17.430
on the spine of one
enormous mountain,

00:08:17.430 --> 00:08:21.030
just as we'd planned,
just as we'd trained for.

00:08:21.030 --> 00:08:23.610
And it was cold and
cloudy, but we were warm,

00:08:23.610 --> 00:08:26.400
and we were climbing,
and we'd probably hiked

00:08:26.400 --> 00:08:30.870
five miles already, as long
as I'd ever hiked in my life.

00:08:30.870 --> 00:08:35.820
We grinned big wolf
grins at each other.

00:08:35.820 --> 00:08:39.059
So the hike didn't
get any easier,

00:08:39.059 --> 00:08:43.610
but I'd had a glimpse of the
wonder of the natural world.

00:08:43.610 --> 00:08:47.390
And I have to say, it gave me
a whole lot more enthusiasm

00:08:47.390 --> 00:08:49.970
for this hike.

00:08:49.970 --> 00:08:52.860
Then things got tougher.

00:08:52.860 --> 00:08:58.070
You see on the left
here-- yes, left--

00:08:58.070 --> 00:09:03.710
Sarah on the Scaur Ridge Trail.

00:09:03.710 --> 00:09:07.640
So I did mean boulders
that we had to hike up.

00:09:07.640 --> 00:09:12.530
And then the other photograph
takes place seven miles later

00:09:12.530 --> 00:09:18.200
and three peaks later, at the
start of the South Slide, which

00:09:18.200 --> 00:09:22.160
basically drops off the
edge of the photograph,

00:09:22.160 --> 00:09:25.580
off the edge of the mountain
like a plumb line for about

00:09:25.580 --> 00:09:30.740
1,000 feet, a plumb
line filled with scree.

00:09:30.740 --> 00:09:35.700
How was I coping with
my fear of heights?

00:09:35.700 --> 00:09:39.260
You'll just have to read
the book to find out.

00:09:39.260 --> 00:09:41.180
Well, we did finish.

00:09:41.180 --> 00:09:43.340
Only took us 10 hours.

00:09:43.340 --> 00:09:48.350
And it took a week for my
leg muscles to unclench.

00:09:48.350 --> 00:09:53.060
But it didn't matter at
all because I was elated.

00:09:53.060 --> 00:09:56.840
I couldn't believe that
I'd actually done it.

00:09:56.840 --> 00:10:00.050
Sarah disappeared back
into her busy life,

00:10:00.050 --> 00:10:03.260
but Kate felt the rapture.

00:10:03.260 --> 00:10:06.290
And on our early-morning
training walks,

00:10:06.290 --> 00:10:10.100
we felt so proud of
ourselves, so strong,

00:10:10.100 --> 00:10:12.800
we strutted through
the neighborhood,

00:10:12.800 --> 00:10:16.890
wanting to pick up
cars and save babies.

00:10:16.890 --> 00:10:20.990
Now, something else
happened on that mountain.

00:10:20.990 --> 00:10:25.510
We met a guy who told us
about the 4,000 Footers,

00:10:25.510 --> 00:10:28.850
and that we were
standing on one.

00:10:28.850 --> 00:10:33.860
He said we, too, could join
the 4,000 Footer Club after--

00:10:33.860 --> 00:10:38.790
only after-- we had
hiked all 48 of them.

00:10:38.790 --> 00:10:41.480
And when we did,
what did we get?

00:10:41.480 --> 00:10:43.010
You're looking at it.

00:10:43.010 --> 00:10:45.300
We got this patch.

00:10:45.300 --> 00:10:51.050
Well, I thought this was a
ridiculous, possibly demented

00:10:51.050 --> 00:10:51.950
idea.

00:10:51.950 --> 00:10:55.830
Who would do such a crazy thing?

00:10:55.830 --> 00:10:57.480
But it stuck with me.

00:10:57.480 --> 00:10:59.870
And over the course of
the next days and weeks,

00:10:59.870 --> 00:11:04.970
I thought, well, I bet the
folks who join that 4,000 Footer

00:11:04.970 --> 00:11:08.042
Club are goal-oriented people.

00:11:08.042 --> 00:11:10.790
Well shoot, I'm a
goal-oriented person.

00:11:10.790 --> 00:11:13.380
I can do this thing.

00:11:13.380 --> 00:11:17.510
The next year, I went out
and bagged three more peaks,

00:11:17.510 --> 00:11:21.560
two with Kate and one a
surprise venture on my own,

00:11:21.560 --> 00:11:24.680
with nobody but my
little Bichon Frise,

00:11:24.680 --> 00:11:26.900
Juniper, who, despite
her appearance,

00:11:26.900 --> 00:11:29.620
was an awesome hiking dog.

00:11:29.620 --> 00:11:33.800
So Kate and I felt pretty
pleased with ourselves,

00:11:33.800 --> 00:11:37.050
until one evening I was in
the kitchen preparing dinner,

00:11:37.050 --> 00:11:39.650
and my daughter
Casey, who was nine,

00:11:39.650 --> 00:11:41.840
was doing homework
at the kitchen table.

00:11:41.840 --> 00:11:45.500
And she said, Mom,
I did the math.

00:11:45.500 --> 00:11:51.170
It's going to take you 21 and
a half years to finish the 48,

00:11:51.170 --> 00:11:54.380
and you'll be 70 and
a half years old,

00:11:54.380 --> 00:11:58.550
and Auntie Kate will
be 76 and a half.

00:11:58.550 --> 00:12:02.810
Kate and I had
not done the math.

00:12:02.810 --> 00:12:05.600
This was clearly not right.

00:12:05.600 --> 00:12:07.610
We couldn't allow
it to be like this.

00:12:07.610 --> 00:12:13.010
So we took the intensive
eight-week-long winter hiking

00:12:13.010 --> 00:12:17.210
course that the AMC puts
on so that we could now

00:12:17.210 --> 00:12:19.910
hike all year long.

00:12:19.910 --> 00:12:23.680
We were ready to rock
and root, my friends.

00:12:23.680 --> 00:12:27.890
Fate, however, had other ideas.

00:12:27.890 --> 00:12:32.540
In the very early days of the
optimistic new millennium,

00:12:32.540 --> 00:12:40.290
Kate underwent surgery, and
they found ovarian cancer.

00:12:40.290 --> 00:12:46.020
Three months later, I was
diagnosed with invasive breast

00:12:46.020 --> 00:12:47.250
cancer.

00:12:47.250 --> 00:12:49.440
We both went into treatment.

00:12:49.440 --> 00:12:54.330
Like Kate, I had surgeries,
rounds of chemotherapy,

00:12:54.330 --> 00:12:58.920
and then I began a five-year
course of tamoxifen.

00:12:58.920 --> 00:13:03.510
And everything gave me
lasting side effects.

00:13:03.510 --> 00:13:08.540
I still have side effects
today, as a matter of fact.

00:13:08.540 --> 00:13:13.450
And then, as you learn in
the prologue of my book,

00:13:13.450 --> 00:13:20.350
in the spring of 2002, ovarian
cancer killed my best friend.

00:13:23.152 --> 00:13:25.120
I was bereft.

00:13:25.120 --> 00:13:28.970
I had no idea how
to fill the void

00:13:28.970 --> 00:13:32.050
this woman left in my life.

00:13:32.050 --> 00:13:36.340
I wasn't much up for
continuing my quest.

00:13:36.340 --> 00:13:38.650
But before she
died, Kate made me

00:13:38.650 --> 00:13:40.960
promise that I would continue.

00:13:40.960 --> 00:13:46.420
She said, it will keep you
strong the way you've kept me.

00:13:46.420 --> 00:13:48.850
She also persuaded
me that I needed

00:13:48.850 --> 00:13:51.100
to get another hiking buddy.

00:13:51.100 --> 00:13:56.230
And I didn't want to, but I did,
because I had more reasons now

00:13:56.230 --> 00:13:59.320
to hike than ever before.

00:13:59.320 --> 00:14:02.260
The mountains were
a place where I

00:14:02.260 --> 00:14:06.100
could go to heal from the
trauma of my own breast cancer.

00:14:06.100 --> 00:14:09.880
And in the wild, it
was spacious enough

00:14:09.880 --> 00:14:17.360
to absorb some of the grief
I felt over losing Kate.

00:14:17.360 --> 00:14:20.000
I had made her another
promise, that I

00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:24.140
would take some of her ashes
to the top of a 4,000 footer.

00:14:24.140 --> 00:14:28.760
I chose Mount Monroe because
was in the Presidentials,

00:14:28.760 --> 00:14:31.760
which are the highest
of the 4,000 Footers,

00:14:31.760 --> 00:14:34.760
and the grandest and
the most difficult.

00:14:34.760 --> 00:14:38.900
I wasn't strong enough yet
to do Mount Washington, which

00:14:38.900 --> 00:14:41.090
you see in the background
of this picture,

00:14:41.090 --> 00:14:44.830
with its towers and observatory.

00:14:44.830 --> 00:14:48.205
And Mount Monroe, next
door to it, this fellow

00:14:48.205 --> 00:14:51.620
is standing on the
trail leading up

00:14:51.620 --> 00:14:55.220
to the summit of Mount Monroe,
so the summit kind of protrudes

00:14:55.220 --> 00:14:59.490
out towards us
from this picture.

00:14:59.490 --> 00:15:07.760
But it was plenty high enough to
push me to and past my limits.

00:15:07.760 --> 00:15:09.750
Sarah came with me.

00:15:09.750 --> 00:15:14.320
I was not strong enough
emotionally or physically to go

00:15:14.320 --> 00:15:15.480
on my own.

00:15:15.480 --> 00:15:20.600
And together, we set Kate
free in the raw, wild winds

00:15:20.600 --> 00:15:23.920
above Oakes Gulf.

00:15:23.920 --> 00:15:29.520
To continue my quest, I
next chose Mount Moosilauke.

00:15:29.520 --> 00:15:32.610
And I picked it because it
was one of the easier ones.

00:15:32.610 --> 00:15:36.180
At least, it was easier
than what I had been doing.

00:15:36.180 --> 00:15:39.330
It was seven and a half
miles long round-trip,

00:15:39.330 --> 00:15:45.930
with 2,450 feet of elevation
gain, or think 81 houses.

00:15:45.930 --> 00:15:50.040
Substantial, but still easier.

00:15:50.040 --> 00:15:54.330
It was a pivotal
climb for me because I

00:15:54.330 --> 00:15:57.630
went with someone new, Ginny.

00:15:57.630 --> 00:16:00.240
Ginny and I had known
each other from our kids'

00:16:00.240 --> 00:16:03.120
school for years,
and we were friends,

00:16:03.120 --> 00:16:05.520
and now we were even
training buddies,

00:16:05.520 --> 00:16:08.070
but we had never hiked together.

00:16:08.070 --> 00:16:10.110
She'd never been to the Whites.

00:16:10.110 --> 00:16:13.130
She'd certainly never
been to a 4,000 footer.

00:16:13.130 --> 00:16:16.980
And Kate had just died.

00:16:16.980 --> 00:16:20.550
I thought you might enjoy
this image of Mount Moosilauke

00:16:20.550 --> 00:16:22.320
from 1912.

00:16:22.320 --> 00:16:25.890
As you can see, on the
summit is a little thing

00:16:25.890 --> 00:16:29.820
that was known as the Tip
Top House, a small hotel.

00:16:29.820 --> 00:16:34.680
And that carriage road was
for horse-drawn buggies

00:16:34.680 --> 00:16:38.620
to take visitors and
guests up to the summit.

00:16:38.620 --> 00:16:41.910
That's the exact same
trail that Ginny and I

00:16:41.910 --> 00:16:44.550
used to ascend to the summit.

00:16:44.550 --> 00:16:49.680
And while it's nowhere near as
broad and pristine as that now,

00:16:49.680 --> 00:16:52.350
it's delightful footing.

00:16:52.350 --> 00:16:55.170
Lots of pine needles
and nice, soft dirt.

00:16:55.170 --> 00:16:56.790
It was wonderful.

00:16:56.790 --> 00:16:59.880
Great way to get up there.

00:16:59.880 --> 00:17:03.480
And we got along so well.

00:17:03.480 --> 00:17:08.250
She also loved wildflowers,
and learning about them.

00:17:08.250 --> 00:17:12.339
And even though I
tried so hard not to,

00:17:12.339 --> 00:17:15.900
she expected me to
compare her to Kate.

00:17:15.900 --> 00:17:19.170
She even asked me questions
about Kate and our hiking

00:17:19.170 --> 00:17:23.819
experiences, and she
held me when I cried.

00:17:23.819 --> 00:17:28.600
Better yet, she wanted to do
another 4,000 footer with me,

00:17:28.600 --> 00:17:31.230
even though our
trail coming down

00:17:31.230 --> 00:17:35.310
was quite direct from the top,
where the Tip Top House is,

00:17:35.310 --> 00:17:37.020
pretty much straight down.

00:17:37.020 --> 00:17:40.440
And it was quite stony,
and difficult on the knees

00:17:40.440 --> 00:17:41.430
and feet.

00:17:41.430 --> 00:17:47.680
And it really kicked my
energy a bunch, I have to say.

00:17:47.680 --> 00:17:51.180
Let's take just a quick trip
through some 4,000 Footers

00:17:51.180 --> 00:17:53.440
so you get to see
some other ones.

00:17:53.440 --> 00:17:57.480
Many of them start in
the woods, like this one.

00:17:57.480 --> 00:17:59.590
That's me back in the day.

00:17:59.590 --> 00:18:03.840
And this trail,
Falling Waters, goes up

00:18:03.840 --> 00:18:08.390
to the somewhat famous
Franconian Ridge Trail

00:18:08.390 --> 00:18:11.770
and to Mounts Lincoln
and Lafayette.

00:18:11.770 --> 00:18:16.590
And it has a lovely, gradual
ascent for the first mile,

00:18:16.590 --> 00:18:21.870
and then it gets wicked,
diabolically steep and hard.

00:18:21.870 --> 00:18:26.250
Hence, its nickname,
Falling Bodies Trail.

00:18:26.250 --> 00:18:30.340
The Presidentials are the
grandest, as I've said.

00:18:30.340 --> 00:18:33.250
And this is a geological
feature that I love.

00:18:33.250 --> 00:18:36.494
It's called the Great Gulf.

00:18:36.494 --> 00:18:38.035
And I could just
stare at it forever.

00:18:41.170 --> 00:18:43.690
On the way up to Mount Moriah--

00:18:43.690 --> 00:18:47.440
that's me again, trying out
yet another knee brace--

00:18:47.440 --> 00:18:49.840
there were some
interesting moments.

00:18:49.840 --> 00:18:51.580
Fear of heights?

00:18:51.580 --> 00:18:55.610
Oh, yes, my goodness.

00:18:55.610 --> 00:18:59.830
Here's a friend, Clara,
a wonderful person

00:18:59.830 --> 00:19:02.950
whom I got to know strictly
through hiking, out

00:19:02.950 --> 00:19:05.920
on the summit of Mount Flume.

00:19:05.920 --> 00:19:09.640
And lest you think that
all of the 4,000 Footers

00:19:09.640 --> 00:19:12.250
are just piles of
rock or rubble,

00:19:12.250 --> 00:19:15.160
here's some that
are lushly green.

00:19:15.160 --> 00:19:18.190
And what I love about
Bond &amp; Bondcliff--

00:19:18.190 --> 00:19:22.540
and there's another
one called West Bond--

00:19:22.540 --> 00:19:27.340
is that, when you're there,
you cannot see a single sign

00:19:27.340 --> 00:19:29.390
of human civilization.

00:19:29.390 --> 00:19:32.200
It's wonderful.

00:19:32.200 --> 00:19:38.080
Just this wilderness to
absorb and appreciate.

00:19:38.080 --> 00:19:41.620
The Wildcats are a
series of five peaks

00:19:41.620 --> 00:19:44.620
that live across the road
from Mount Washington.

00:19:44.620 --> 00:19:48.640
And here, you see first
Sarah, followed by Ginny,

00:19:48.640 --> 00:19:53.730
followed by Rosemary, another
friend who hiked with me.

00:19:53.730 --> 00:20:01.370
Now, as in any endurance sport,
the mental game is paramount.

00:20:01.370 --> 00:20:02.030
Right?

00:20:02.030 --> 00:20:05.270
Even when our bodies
can be totally fit

00:20:05.270 --> 00:20:09.420
and trained and ready,
our minds can do us in.

00:20:09.420 --> 00:20:13.880
And this is true on
any marathon endeavor--

00:20:13.880 --> 00:20:19.280
sports, but other
things like a renovation

00:20:19.280 --> 00:20:22.910
project for your house,
or a months-long campaign

00:20:22.910 --> 00:20:27.810
to get a promotion, or a
multi-year design project.

00:20:27.810 --> 00:20:33.650
Whatever it is, we have to both
stay trained on what sometimes

00:20:33.650 --> 00:20:37.550
feels like in the far distance,
the goal we want to attain,

00:20:37.550 --> 00:20:40.220
but also we have to
keep moving forward

00:20:40.220 --> 00:20:44.570
and keep ourselves on track.

00:20:44.570 --> 00:20:48.520
One of the ways that I
found that helped me do this

00:20:48.520 --> 00:20:50.530
was finding role models.

00:20:50.530 --> 00:20:53.740
Now, on the trails,
I mostly saw men,

00:20:53.740 --> 00:20:58.900
so I was keen to find a woman
role model to teach and inspire

00:20:58.900 --> 00:20:59.500
me.

00:20:59.500 --> 00:21:03.400
And the woman that
I came up with

00:21:03.400 --> 00:21:07.240
was a climber called
Annie Smith Peck.

00:21:07.240 --> 00:21:11.500
Has anybody heard of
her, Annie Smith Peck?

00:21:11.500 --> 00:21:13.270
She was amazing.

00:21:13.270 --> 00:21:16.930
Here's an image of
Annie Smith Peck

00:21:16.930 --> 00:21:20.080
on the cover of a book that
was a biography written

00:21:20.080 --> 00:21:22.270
about her in 2017.

00:21:22.270 --> 00:21:28.200
And that's what she wore to
summit the Matterhorn in 1895.

00:21:28.200 --> 00:21:31.030
And she scandalized
the world not

00:21:31.030 --> 00:21:33.490
because she summited
as a woman, that

00:21:33.490 --> 00:21:39.610
had already been done in 1871,
but because she wore pants.

00:21:39.610 --> 00:21:42.730
She was a wonderful
role model for me

00:21:42.730 --> 00:21:46.600
because she didn't even start
hiking until her mid 30s, which

00:21:46.600 --> 00:21:49.540
was considered pretty old.

00:21:49.540 --> 00:21:54.250
She hiked, she practiced for 10
years before going on to summit

00:21:54.250 --> 00:21:57.530
the Matterhorn at age 45.

00:21:57.530 --> 00:22:02.230
And then she became the
first person, woman or man,

00:22:02.230 --> 00:22:07.270
to climb the highest peak in
the Americas, Mount Huascaran

00:22:07.270 --> 00:22:10.820
in Peru, about 22,000 feet high.

00:22:10.820 --> 00:22:14.290
I tell you, every time I read
anything about Annie Smith

00:22:14.290 --> 00:22:16.570
Peck, I just wanted
to run right out

00:22:16.570 --> 00:22:19.350
and tackle another 4,000 Footer.

00:22:19.350 --> 00:22:23.470
And isn't that what we want
our role models to do for us?

00:22:23.470 --> 00:22:28.190
To inspire us, to encourage
us, to keep us going.

00:22:28.190 --> 00:22:35.110
I also found it important
to write down the progress

00:22:35.110 --> 00:22:39.160
that I was making, because this
was a multi-year effort for me.

00:22:39.160 --> 00:22:42.850
And so each day,
I write down what

00:22:42.850 --> 00:22:46.060
I do for physical
training, mental training,

00:22:46.060 --> 00:22:47.830
and what I do professionally.

00:22:47.830 --> 00:22:52.030
So nowadays, working on my book.

00:22:52.030 --> 00:22:56.570
I find that, when I go to
review it at the end of a week,

00:22:56.570 --> 00:23:00.490
I'm always astounded how
much I've forgotten that I

00:23:00.490 --> 00:23:03.630
did earlier on in the week.

00:23:03.630 --> 00:23:07.180
And it's very helpful to be
able to look back and see

00:23:07.180 --> 00:23:09.760
that, yes, I have
achieved things,

00:23:09.760 --> 00:23:12.410
yes, I'm making progress.

00:23:12.410 --> 00:23:18.950
I am moving forward toward
that long-term goal.

00:23:18.950 --> 00:23:22.600
Another way that I did that
was with this birthday gift

00:23:22.600 --> 00:23:26.470
from my husband, Larry, who
mounted it on a poster board

00:23:26.470 --> 00:23:28.510
and hung it on my wall.

00:23:28.510 --> 00:23:34.260
He strategically placed
48 blue pins on it.

00:23:34.260 --> 00:23:38.860
And so every time I
came back from a climb,

00:23:38.860 --> 00:23:41.590
I would swap out the
blue pin for a red one

00:23:41.590 --> 00:23:44.110
with a number on it
that corresponded

00:23:44.110 --> 00:23:48.430
to the number of 4,000
Footer it was for me.

00:23:48.430 --> 00:23:52.170
I could see at a glance all
that I had accomplished,

00:23:52.170 --> 00:23:56.380
and I could also see at a glance
exactly what I had left to go.

00:23:56.380 --> 00:24:02.090
And it was very helpful in
terms of choosing my next hike.

00:24:02.090 --> 00:24:04.930
Another mental training tip--

00:24:04.930 --> 00:24:06.480
celebrate.

00:24:06.480 --> 00:24:10.950
Here you see Clara and I doing
what became a tradition on all

00:24:10.950 --> 00:24:14.910
my hikes, the peak dance.

00:24:14.910 --> 00:24:20.220
It was designed to make us
look as ridiculous, as goofy as

00:24:20.220 --> 00:24:21.660
humanly possible.

00:24:21.660 --> 00:24:25.020
We sang this absurd little
ditty that I made up.

00:24:25.020 --> 00:24:27.150
And why did we do it?

00:24:27.150 --> 00:24:30.200
Well, every time we
did it, we laughed.

00:24:30.200 --> 00:24:33.420
And as studies have shown,
laughter is good medicine.

00:24:33.420 --> 00:24:36.960
But in addition,
when you celebrate,

00:24:36.960 --> 00:24:41.130
your body releases dopamine,
one of the happy chemicals

00:24:41.130 --> 00:24:44.400
in the body, like serotonin.

00:24:44.400 --> 00:24:48.210
Dopamine is awesome
because not only does it

00:24:48.210 --> 00:24:51.160
help you set your goals
in the first place,

00:24:51.160 --> 00:24:53.160
but when you achieve
them, it gives you

00:24:53.160 --> 00:24:55.710
this big rush of pleasure.

00:24:55.710 --> 00:25:00.230
So why not celebrate
as often as you can?

00:25:03.520 --> 00:25:06.270
Now I'd like to
talk about something

00:25:06.270 --> 00:25:11.970
that is incredibly important to
me, and became so in my book.

00:25:11.970 --> 00:25:15.870
Finding a home for
myself in nature

00:25:15.870 --> 00:25:20.640
became a chief part
of every climb.

00:25:20.640 --> 00:25:25.200
When I hiked, I made sure,
no matter with whom I was,

00:25:25.200 --> 00:25:27.450
that I had time to
hike alone so that I

00:25:27.450 --> 00:25:31.830
could tune into the
natural world around me

00:25:31.830 --> 00:25:39.600
and make that connection to
nature that we were made to do.

00:25:39.600 --> 00:25:41.520
It was such a gift.

00:25:41.520 --> 00:25:45.090
No matter how hard the
climb had been-- and for me,

00:25:45.090 --> 00:25:48.510
they were pretty much all hard--

00:25:48.510 --> 00:25:53.880
no matter how injured or
bruised I was when I got back,

00:25:53.880 --> 00:25:58.920
I always felt that I had come
back brimming with energy.

00:25:58.920 --> 00:26:02.370
It was as if there was this
internal reservoir that

00:26:02.370 --> 00:26:08.000
had gone dry, and I filled
it up on the mountains

00:26:08.000 --> 00:26:14.460
with exhilarance and
exuberance and just a zest for.

00:26:14.460 --> 00:26:17.270
Living

00:26:17.270 --> 00:26:20.540
As Rachel Carson once wrote--

00:26:20.540 --> 00:26:25.130
you remember Rachel
Carson, the author in 1962

00:26:25.130 --> 00:26:26.940
of "The Silent
Spring," she was one

00:26:26.940 --> 00:26:32.390
of our early conservationists
and environmentalists--

00:26:32.390 --> 00:26:38.660
she said, those who contemplate
the beauty of the Earth

00:26:38.660 --> 00:26:41.570
develop reserves
of strength that

00:26:41.570 --> 00:26:46.050
endure as long as life lasts.

00:26:46.050 --> 00:26:51.540
I'd like to read you a passage
from my book that gives you

00:26:51.540 --> 00:26:55.830
a glimpse of how I felt on
the top of my sixth 4,000

00:26:55.830 --> 00:26:58.740
Footer, the one you
see here, the larger

00:26:58.740 --> 00:27:01.800
one on the left, Mount Osceola.

00:27:01.800 --> 00:27:07.920
On the right is East
Peak, also a 4,000 Footer.

00:27:07.920 --> 00:27:12.380
When I hiked Mount Osceola,
it was my first 4,000 Footer

00:27:12.380 --> 00:27:13.820
after cancer.

00:27:13.820 --> 00:27:17.000
It had been a year since
the end of treatment,

00:27:17.000 --> 00:27:20.210
two years since my last climb.

00:27:20.210 --> 00:27:28.310
And I was still quite weak, but
it was a glorious fall day up

00:27:28.310 --> 00:27:30.650
in Waterville Valley,
New Hampshire,

00:27:30.650 --> 00:27:32.480
where we had an apartment.

00:27:32.480 --> 00:27:35.510
And I persuaded my
family to go with me.

00:27:35.510 --> 00:27:37.220
The temperature was gorgeous.

00:27:37.220 --> 00:27:39.140
The sun was shining.

00:27:39.140 --> 00:27:43.970
And it was just a day to try it.

00:27:43.970 --> 00:27:49.430
It was 6.4 miles round-trip,
a little over 2,000 feet,

00:27:49.430 --> 00:27:51.140
so think 70 houses.

00:27:51.140 --> 00:27:54.340
I thought, yeah, I bet
I can do 70 houses.

00:27:54.340 --> 00:27:58.100
So as soon as we started
off, Casey, now 11 years old,

00:27:58.100 --> 00:28:01.080
and Juniper just tore off.

00:28:01.080 --> 00:28:05.720
And once they were out of sight,
I begged Larry to slow down.

00:28:05.720 --> 00:28:09.110
He was already
carrying all my gear.

00:28:09.110 --> 00:28:12.250
I couldn't even manage
my water bottle.

00:28:12.250 --> 00:28:14.690
And then, after
the first mile, I

00:28:14.690 --> 00:28:17.420
was stumbling and
shambling along.

00:28:17.420 --> 00:28:19.800
Larry was boosting
me up over rocks.

00:28:19.800 --> 00:28:24.140
And sometimes, he went ahead
and leaned down and pulled me up

00:28:24.140 --> 00:28:26.210
a ledge.

00:28:26.210 --> 00:28:29.720
As we got closer to the
top, I was literally

00:28:29.720 --> 00:28:34.870
grabbing a leg with both
hands to pull it forward.

00:28:34.870 --> 00:28:39.350
But I was so grateful to be
back in the mountains again.

00:28:39.350 --> 00:28:45.080
Not just because of my quest
and the 4,000 Footer club,

00:28:45.080 --> 00:28:49.530
but because I was
back in the wild,

00:28:49.530 --> 00:28:52.310
where I felt I
belonged, where I felt

00:28:52.310 --> 00:28:56.110
like I was one with everything.

00:28:56.110 --> 00:28:59.030
Casey and Juniper
summited first,

00:28:59.030 --> 00:29:01.520
then Larry hauled
me over the top.

00:29:01.520 --> 00:29:04.760
I stood there
breathing and shaking.

00:29:04.760 --> 00:29:07.820
After I waved them
on, they wandered off

00:29:07.820 --> 00:29:11.790
to explore the broad ledges
and take in the view.

00:29:11.790 --> 00:29:16.160
Once my legs steadied, I crossed
the summit to the nearest edge,

00:29:16.160 --> 00:29:20.030
expecting to see a pretty view
of skinny Waterville Valley,

00:29:20.030 --> 00:29:23.480
just from a different
orientation.

00:29:23.480 --> 00:29:27.980
I was wrong, delightfully wrong.

00:29:27.980 --> 00:29:31.840
Gazing eastward, I marveled
at Mount Tripyramid,

00:29:31.840 --> 00:29:34.460
the brute size of it.

00:29:34.460 --> 00:29:37.400
Words rolled through
my weary brain--

00:29:37.400 --> 00:29:43.310
majestic, powerful, humbling.

00:29:43.310 --> 00:29:46.140
I turned slowly to
soak up the landscape,

00:29:46.140 --> 00:29:49.650
allowing myself to believe that,
though sometimes nearly carried

00:29:49.650 --> 00:29:56.700
by Larry, I had actually
summited Osceola post-cancer.

00:29:56.700 --> 00:29:59.880
I turned to the
northeastern view.

00:29:59.880 --> 00:30:04.290
Before me spread wave
after wave of mountain.

00:30:04.290 --> 00:30:07.710
I counted no fewer
than seven ranges,

00:30:07.710 --> 00:30:10.610
each surging behind another.

00:30:10.610 --> 00:30:13.980
They stretched to the
horizon emerald blue,

00:30:13.980 --> 00:30:16.200
and as they marched
farther away,

00:30:16.200 --> 00:30:21.510
shadowy, cerulean shapes that
touched the deeper blue of sky.

00:30:21.510 --> 00:30:24.990
I felt caught up in the
motion of those rocky waves.

00:30:24.990 --> 00:30:27.810
I could take off into
those mountains up and down

00:30:27.810 --> 00:30:31.050
and over until I knew
each and every peak.

00:30:31.050 --> 00:30:33.900
I could let go of my
complicated city life

00:30:33.900 --> 00:30:37.800
and live in the mountains,
exploring them all day long

00:30:37.800 --> 00:30:40.660
and sleeping in them at night.

00:30:40.660 --> 00:30:43.710
The vast, astonishing
beauty caused,

00:30:43.710 --> 00:30:46.860
along with the joy, an ache.

00:30:46.860 --> 00:30:48.870
The mountains
called for grandeur,

00:30:48.870 --> 00:30:52.950
and I was only one person,
and at that, a lesser version

00:30:52.950 --> 00:30:55.290
of who I was before.

00:30:55.290 --> 00:30:59.550
If only I were a more
tolerant, better person.

00:30:59.550 --> 00:31:03.420
I longed for everyone to
experience this breaking open

00:31:03.420 --> 00:31:07.260
of the spirit that was at
once nourishing, illuminating,

00:31:07.260 --> 00:31:09.670
and sweetly painful.

00:31:09.670 --> 00:31:16.140
Here, a world existed in which
all things, small and large,

00:31:16.140 --> 00:31:21.960
mobile and rooted, oxygen-giving
and oxygen-absorbing

00:31:21.960 --> 00:31:27.270
had a place in a
balanced, sacred whole.

00:31:27.270 --> 00:31:31.620
I was on such a mountain high
I didn't even know I was high.

00:31:31.620 --> 00:31:33.966
I felt certain that, if
everyone could spend time

00:31:33.966 --> 00:31:35.340
in the mountains,
it would change

00:31:35.340 --> 00:31:37.630
the fabric of our society.

00:31:37.630 --> 00:31:41.700
I was ready to hug all
the strangers on Osceola,

00:31:41.700 --> 00:31:45.000
invoke their promise to
safeguard this place,

00:31:45.000 --> 00:31:48.210
and take the lessons garnered
here back home to share.

00:31:48.210 --> 00:31:49.872
We could organize.

00:31:49.872 --> 00:31:52.470
"Mom!"

00:31:52.470 --> 00:31:55.650
The sound of Casey's
voice startled me.

00:31:55.650 --> 00:31:59.750
Deep in my mountain reverie,
I'd forgotten she existed.

00:32:03.330 --> 00:32:09.180
I hiked 43 of the 48
mountains in my 50s

00:32:09.180 --> 00:32:16.410
after cancer, finishing up
in 2008 at the age of 58.

00:32:16.410 --> 00:32:20.230
Doing the 4,000 Footers
inspired me to write a book.

00:32:20.230 --> 00:32:22.320
And though it's
not a novel, I do

00:32:22.320 --> 00:32:25.740
feel that it helped me
accomplish my dream of having

00:32:25.740 --> 00:32:29.270
a published book.

00:32:29.270 --> 00:32:33.410
I finished my quest a different
and, I hope, a better person.

00:32:33.410 --> 00:32:38.750
Certainly a more humble
and grateful one,

00:32:38.750 --> 00:32:41.780
one who better understood
how little control

00:32:41.780 --> 00:32:45.500
she had over life,
and who understood

00:32:45.500 --> 00:32:50.480
she needed to redefine success
so that it met my needs

00:32:50.480 --> 00:32:53.240
and fulfilled me.

00:32:53.240 --> 00:32:57.230
And also one who took every
opportunity to put herself

00:32:57.230 --> 00:32:59.890
in the embrace of nature.

00:32:59.890 --> 00:33:03.240
Now, I'm still getting
out and hiking.

00:33:03.240 --> 00:33:07.070
And in a few weeks,
I'll turn 68.

00:33:07.070 --> 00:33:11.080
I'm taking my hiking experience
to other parts of the world.

00:33:11.080 --> 00:33:15.810
For my 61st birthday, Larry
and I went to New Zealand.

00:33:15.810 --> 00:33:20.450
You see him there on the
Kepler Track, one of the great

00:33:20.450 --> 00:33:22.400
walks in New Zealand.

00:33:22.400 --> 00:33:26.060
We did this in late spring,
and we were totally shocked,

00:33:26.060 --> 00:33:29.510
as was everyone else
around us, to be faced

00:33:29.510 --> 00:33:32.300
with the danger of avalanches.

00:33:32.300 --> 00:33:35.300
Back in the US,
Jenny and I signed up

00:33:35.300 --> 00:33:38.870
for a Sierra Club trip
in the Northern Cascades

00:33:38.870 --> 00:33:40.160
of Washington.

00:33:40.160 --> 00:33:43.850
The trip was called
Wildflowers and Wanderlust,

00:33:43.850 --> 00:33:45.110
and it was gorgeous.

00:33:45.110 --> 00:33:52.730
Here, you see Hikes Pass,
up around 10,000 feet.

00:33:52.730 --> 00:33:59.030
In the summer of 2017, Larry
and I enjoyed a trip to Poland.

00:33:59.030 --> 00:34:03.680
And here we are
hiking the highest

00:34:03.680 --> 00:34:08.120
of the Carpathian mountain
range, the High Tatras.

00:34:11.340 --> 00:34:16.969
I leave you and end my
story with three wishes.

00:34:16.969 --> 00:34:22.500
May you continue to do your
utmost to preserve and protect

00:34:22.500 --> 00:34:26.850
our planet and its
health, our only home,

00:34:26.850 --> 00:34:30.460
before it's too late.

00:34:30.460 --> 00:34:35.730
May you continue spending
time outdoors, maybe even more

00:34:35.730 --> 00:34:40.530
than you already do, whether
that's noticing nature

00:34:40.530 --> 00:34:42.989
in the form of trees
on the sidewalk

00:34:42.989 --> 00:34:46.050
or some little weed
that's grown up

00:34:46.050 --> 00:34:47.739
through cracks in the pavement.

00:34:47.739 --> 00:34:51.840
I mean, what a lesson in
endurance and perseverance

00:34:51.840 --> 00:34:53.130
that is.

00:34:53.130 --> 00:34:57.960
Or better yet, if you can
get out into the wild.

00:34:57.960 --> 00:35:01.800
I mean, we were made
to connect with nature.

00:35:01.800 --> 00:35:04.890
And I hope you've
come to understand

00:35:04.890 --> 00:35:09.420
some of the benefits I derived
by spending as much time as I

00:35:09.420 --> 00:35:13.210
did and do out in nature.

00:35:13.210 --> 00:35:19.380
And lastly, may you succeed on
your own quests, whatever kind

00:35:19.380 --> 00:35:22.230
of mountains those involve.

00:35:22.230 --> 00:35:26.010
I believe what Eleanor
Roosevelt said,

00:35:26.010 --> 00:35:29.460
the future belongs
to those who believe

00:35:29.460 --> 00:35:32.040
in the beauty of their dreams.

00:35:32.040 --> 00:35:34.410
So keep dreaming.

00:35:34.410 --> 00:35:36.240
Thanks for listening.
