00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:04.070
Judging by the percentages we discussed before, mental illness is pretty

00:00:04.070 --> 00:00:09.530
common, something that every family experiences either directly or indirectly.

00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:13.490
Because of this, mental health literacy is something that we should strive for

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:16.970
as a culture, given that almost half of us will experience some type of

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:22.705
disorder in our life. In addition, over half of the people who experience at

00:00:22.705 --> 00:00:27.960
least one psychological disorder, will also experience a second disorder.

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:33.084
Having two or more mental disorders occurring at the same time, is termed

00:00:33.084 --> 00:00:40.981
comorbidity. The new DSM-5 lists 21 major categories of disorders and over 350

00:00:40.981 --> 00:00:47.200
distinct disorders. Now, as we mentioned at the beginning of the study, we want

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:50.860
to remind you that not all psychologists agree with the categories in the

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:57.645
DSM-5, or with the notion that there are 350 distinct disorders. And also it's

00:00:57.645 --> 00:01:01.740
important to know that what's considered a disorder in the past, sometimes

00:01:01.740 --> 00:01:09.040
changes over time. So the DSM isn't set in stone. For example, homosexuality

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:15.214
was listed as a mental disorder in the DSM. Which clearly we know no longer is

00:01:15.214 --> 00:01:19.707
the case. Nevertheless, given the historical use of the DSM, we'll discuss some

00:01:19.707 --> 00:01:25.105
of these categories in this lesson. Specifically, we'll discuss some of the 21

00:01:25.105 --> 00:01:29.980
major categories of disorders, Including, Neurodevelopmental disorders,

00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:34.030
Depressive disorders, Bipolar disorders, Anxiety disorders,

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:39.205
Obsessive-compulsive disorder, Post traumatic stress disorder, Dissociative

00:01:39.205 --> 00:01:44.080
disorders, Somatic symptom disorders, Personality disorders, and finally

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:47.860
schizophrenia.
