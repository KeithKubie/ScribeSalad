00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
In the 18th century, it was all the rage to study electricity.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:07.000
Everyone was doing it, and the thing they were storing their electricity in

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.000
was known as a Leyden jar.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
Now, we don't need to go into the details of how this jar worked just yet,

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.000
but the key thing to know is that if there is a process which involved friction

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
this jar could become charged.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:23.000
And for now, let's say that charged means the jar possesses electricity in some way.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:29.000
Well once it was charged, the electrodes of this jar could be connected to wires

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000
and by attaching these wires to various objects

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.000
you could see things like sparks or you could even start a fire.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:38.000
Now remember, Benjamin Franklin's idea was that lightning is somehow

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.000
the same thing as the electricity that scientists

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.000
have been playing around with in these Leyden jars.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:47.000
So my question is, which of the following options would be the most convincing

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.000
demonstration to show that lightning is actually the same thing

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.000
as the electricity in these Leyden jars?

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.000
Would we want to show that lightning, like a Leyden jar,

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.000
can actually somehow cause a fire?

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:02.000
Would we want to show that we can use lightning directly to charge a Leyden jar?

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.000
Would we want to use lightning to destroy a Leyden jar?

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:08.000
Or would we want to see if lightning somehow increases friction?

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:13.000
The thinking being that Leyden jars were somehow charged by a process that involve friction.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.000
Which of these four options should Benjamin Franklin do

00:01:15.000 --> 99:59:59.000
if he wants to convincingly prove that lightning is electricity?
