going to this is kind of more of a like
this is what Carson is thinking about

00:00:19.750 --> 00:00:19.760
this is what Carson is thinking about
 

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:23.170
this is what Carson is thinking about
right now set of slides and it just so

00:00:23.170 --> 00:00:23.180
right now set of slides and it just so
 

00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:24.370
right now set of slides and it just so
happens that it ties into our topic

00:00:24.370 --> 00:00:24.380
happens that it ties into our topic
 

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:27.700
happens that it ties into our topic
about open data today so I'm gonna go

00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:27.710
about open data today so I'm gonna go
 

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:30.249
about open data today so I'm gonna go
through and I'll try to link a few ideas

00:00:30.249 --> 00:00:30.259
through and I'll try to link a few ideas
 

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:33.460
through and I'll try to link a few ideas
back to what some of my cope panelists

00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:33.470
back to what some of my cope panelists
 

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:35.350
back to what some of my cope panelists
have talked about and then I'll try and

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:35.360
have talked about and then I'll try and
 

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:37.360
have talked about and then I'll try and
finish off maybe with some suggestions

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:37.370
finish off maybe with some suggestions
 

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:39.610
finish off maybe with some suggestions
for possible discussion topics once we

00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:39.620
for possible discussion topics once we
 

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:42.250
for possible discussion topics once we
once we're finished so but before I do

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:42.260
once we're finished so but before I do
 

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:46.599
once we're finished so but before I do
that I'll tell you maybe why it's me I

00:00:46.599 --> 00:00:46.609
that I'll tell you maybe why it's me I
 

00:00:46.609 --> 00:00:48.310
that I'll tell you maybe why it's me I
should be here right you always have to

00:00:48.310 --> 00:00:48.320
should be here right you always have to
 

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:49.750
should be here right you always have to
kind of justify your existence in

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:49.760
kind of justify your existence in
 

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:51.579
kind of justify your existence in
academia so that's what this slide is

00:00:51.579 --> 00:00:51.589
academia so that's what this slide is
 

00:00:51.589 --> 00:00:57.959
academia so that's what this slide is
about so I I'll admit to being a former

00:00:57.959 --> 00:00:57.969
about so I I'll admit to being a former
 

00:00:57.969 --> 00:01:01.419
about so I I'll admit to being a former
open sources elet I used to sort of say

00:01:01.419 --> 00:01:01.429
open sources elet I used to sort of say
 

00:01:01.429 --> 00:01:03.399
open sources elet I used to sort of say
if it's not if you're not using open

00:01:03.399 --> 00:01:03.409
if it's not if you're not using open
 

00:01:03.409 --> 00:01:04.570
if it's not if you're not using open
source and open data then you're not

00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:04.580
source and open data then you're not
 

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:07.330
source and open data then you're not
doing science because if it's not

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:07.340
doing science because if it's not
 

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:09.040
doing science because if it's not
completely open people can't reproduce

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:09.050
completely open people can't reproduce
 

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:10.420
completely open people can't reproduce
what you're doing right and that's what

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:10.430
what you're doing right and that's what
 

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:12.610
what you're doing right and that's what
science is it's reproducible it's here's

00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:12.620
science is it's reproducible it's here's
 

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:14.020
science is it's reproducible it's here's
what I did in order to answer this

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:14.030
what I did in order to answer this
 

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:16.300
what I did in order to answer this
interesting question and so you know I

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:16.310
interesting question and so you know I
 

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:19.600
interesting question and so you know I
used to sort of scoff it others who

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:19.610
used to sort of scoff it others who
 

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:21.550
used to sort of scoff it others who
weren't doing things in an open way and

00:01:21.550 --> 00:01:21.560
weren't doing things in an open way and
 

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:23.530
weren't doing things in an open way and
I've sort of changed my perspective over

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:23.540
I've sort of changed my perspective over
 

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:25.410
I've sort of changed my perspective over
time and so I'll talk a little bit about

00:01:25.410 --> 00:01:25.420
time and so I'll talk a little bit about
 

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:28.300
time and so I'll talk a little bit about
why my perspective has changed and some

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:28.310
why my perspective has changed and some
 

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:30.040
why my perspective has changed and some
of the people and ideas that have

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:30.050
of the people and ideas that have
 

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:31.900
of the people and ideas that have
influenced that and hopefully tie that

00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:31.910
influenced that and hopefully tie that
 

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:36.220
influenced that and hopefully tie that
into this idea of openness okay so but

00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:36.230
into this idea of openness okay so but
 

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:37.960
into this idea of openness okay so but
why I'm here I've worked on the hugest

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:37.970
why I'm here I've worked on the hugest
 

00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:41.730
why I'm here I've worked on the hugest
open source GIS project since about 2007

00:01:41.730 --> 00:01:41.740
open source GIS project since about 2007
 

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:44.200
open source GIS project since about 2007
so for those who are keeping track that

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:44.210
so for those who are keeping track that
 

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:46.690
so for those who are keeping track that
means I'm kind of like an open source

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:46.700
means I'm kind of like an open source
 

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:48.580
means I'm kind of like an open source
hipster right I wasn't there at the

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:48.590
hipster right I wasn't there at the
 

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:50.350
hipster right I wasn't there at the
beginning in the 90s when things were

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:50.360
beginning in the 90s when things were
 

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:52.030
beginning in the 90s when things were
really taking off but I got there kind

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:52.040
really taking off but I got there kind
 

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:54.340
really taking off but I got there kind
of early before was cool so I would

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:54.350
of early before was cool so I would
 

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:56.560
of early before was cool so I would
consider myself a an open source hipster

00:01:56.560 --> 00:01:56.570
consider myself a an open source hipster
 

00:01:56.570 --> 00:01:58.510
consider myself a an open source hipster
and particularly in terms of interacting

00:01:58.510 --> 00:01:58.520
and particularly in terms of interacting
 

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:00.700
and particularly in terms of interacting
with the hugest project and the coolest

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:00.710
with the hugest project and the coolest
 

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:02.740
with the hugest project and the coolest
thing about the hugest project now is

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:02.750
thing about the hugest project now is
 

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:05.620
thing about the hugest project now is
that they don't need me anymore

00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:05.630
that they don't need me anymore
 

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:07.480
that they don't need me anymore
so a lot of the things that I did at the

00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:07.490
so a lot of the things that I did at the
 

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:09.910
so a lot of the things that I did at the
time developing a lot of the tools and

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:09.920
time developing a lot of the tools and
 

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:11.259
time developing a lot of the tools and
things that went into it I haven't

00:02:11.259 --> 00:02:11.269
things that went into it I haven't
 

00:02:11.269 --> 00:02:12.760
things that went into it I haven't
touched in years and they still exist

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:12.770
touched in years and they still exist
 

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:15.760
touched in years and they still exist
and they still get used by millions

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:15.770
and they still get used by millions
 

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:17.140
and they still get used by millions
actually of download

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:17.150
actually of download
 

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:20.920
actually of download
now every month for new versions or for

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:20.930
now every month for new versions or for
 

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:22.539
now every month for new versions or for
the latest version of kuja's and my name

00:02:22.539 --> 00:02:22.549
the latest version of kuja's and my name
 

00:02:22.549 --> 00:02:24.520
the latest version of kuja's and my name
is embedded in the code somewhere so

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:24.530
is embedded in the code somewhere so
 

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:26.830
is embedded in the code somewhere so
millions of times a month my name gets

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:26.840
millions of times a month my name gets
 

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:28.089
millions of times a month my name gets
downloaded on to someone's computer

00:02:28.089 --> 00:02:28.099
downloaded on to someone's computer
 

00:02:28.099 --> 00:02:30.580
downloaded on to someone's computer
which is pretty cool and in fact that's

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:30.590
which is pretty cool and in fact that's
 

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:31.780
which is pretty cool and in fact that's
actually want one thing I did want to

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:31.790
actually want one thing I did want to
 

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:34.509
actually want one thing I did want to
talk about in terms of openness and open

00:02:34.509 --> 00:02:34.519
talk about in terms of openness and open
 

00:02:34.519 --> 00:02:37.059
talk about in terms of openness and open
source and open data is it was probably

00:02:37.059 --> 00:02:37.069
source and open data is it was probably
 

00:02:37.069 --> 00:02:38.940
source and open data is it was probably
the smartest move I made career-wise

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:38.950
the smartest move I made career-wise
 

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:41.170
the smartest move I made career-wise
because it actually provides an

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:41.180
because it actually provides an
 

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:42.670
because it actually provides an
opportunity to interact with a lot

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:42.680
opportunity to interact with a lot
 

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:45.910
opportunity to interact with a lot
larger community of researchers and

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:45.920
larger community of researchers and
 

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:48.009
larger community of researchers and
individuals and things like that and so

00:02:48.009 --> 00:02:48.019
individuals and things like that and so
 

00:02:48.019 --> 00:02:50.740
individuals and things like that and so
I'll talk about this idea of open not

00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:50.750
I'll talk about this idea of open not
 

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:52.539
I'll talk about this idea of open not
necessarily equating to access but

00:02:52.539 --> 00:02:52.549
necessarily equating to access but
 

00:02:52.549 --> 00:02:55.899
necessarily equating to access but
certainly at least promoting it so now I

00:02:55.899 --> 00:02:55.909
certainly at least promoting it so now I
 

00:02:55.909 --> 00:02:57.879
certainly at least promoting it so now I
work a lot of on geospatial Python

00:02:57.879 --> 00:02:57.889
work a lot of on geospatial Python
 

00:02:57.889 --> 00:03:00.190
work a lot of on geospatial Python
packages do a lot of programming in that

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:00.200
packages do a lot of programming in that
 

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:02.770
packages do a lot of programming in that
realm that's all open source stuff and

00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:02.780
realm that's all open source stuff and
 

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:04.119
realm that's all open source stuff and
then recently I've been involved in

00:03:04.119 --> 00:03:04.129
then recently I've been involved in
 

00:03:04.129 --> 00:03:06.309
then recently I've been involved in
something called the enviro car data

00:03:06.309 --> 00:03:06.319
something called the enviro car data
 

00:03:06.319 --> 00:03:08.500
something called the enviro car data
project so this is a project where we

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:08.510
project so this is a project where we
 

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:10.929
project so this is a project where we
collect environmental data from people's

00:03:10.929 --> 00:03:10.939
collect environmental data from people's
 

00:03:10.939 --> 00:03:12.580
collect environmental data from people's
smartphones as they drive around and

00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:12.590
smartphones as they drive around and
 

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:14.679
smartphones as they drive around and
it's like they involved here to do this

00:03:14.679 --> 00:03:14.689
it's like they involved here to do this
 

00:03:14.689 --> 00:03:16.869
it's like they involved here to do this
we're not just sneaking on people and

00:03:16.869 --> 00:03:16.879
we're not just sneaking on people and
 

00:03:16.879 --> 00:03:18.910
we're not just sneaking on people and
the environment data is made available

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:18.920
the environment data is made available
 

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:23.500
the environment data is made available
as open linked data so that any research

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:23.510
as open linked data so that any research
 

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:26.020
as open linked data so that any research
or a planner someone concerned with

00:03:26.020 --> 00:03:26.030
or a planner someone concerned with
 

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:28.330
or a planner someone concerned with
urban environmental issues can use the

00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:28.340
urban environmental issues can use the
 

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:30.309
urban environmental issues can use the
data it's completely anonymized and we

00:03:30.309 --> 00:03:30.319
data it's completely anonymized and we
 

00:03:30.319 --> 00:03:32.409
data it's completely anonymized and we
address a lot or we try to address a lot

00:03:32.409 --> 00:03:32.419
address a lot or we try to address a lot
 

00:03:32.419 --> 00:03:34.479
address a lot or we try to address a lot
of the issues with open data so I can

00:03:34.479 --> 00:03:34.489
of the issues with open data so I can
 

00:03:34.489 --> 00:03:36.430
of the issues with open data so I can
talk a little bit about that as well as

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:36.440
talk a little bit about that as well as
 

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:39.309
talk a little bit about that as well as
we get sort of further along but as I

00:03:39.309 --> 00:03:39.319
we get sort of further along but as I
 

00:03:39.319 --> 00:03:43.089
we get sort of further along but as I
said I was a former open source zealot

00:03:43.089 --> 00:03:43.099
said I was a former open source zealot
 

00:03:43.099 --> 00:03:44.920
said I was a former open source zealot
and this is probably what sort of

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:44.930
and this is probably what sort of
 

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:48.430
and this is probably what sort of
spawned that initial sort of reaction to

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:48.440
spawned that initial sort of reaction to
 

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:53.619
spawned that initial sort of reaction to
not being open so during my PhD I was

00:03:53.619 --> 00:03:53.629
not being open so during my PhD I was
 

00:03:53.629 --> 00:03:55.420
not being open so during my PhD I was
writing a paper and I wanted to make it

00:03:55.420 --> 00:03:55.430
writing a paper and I wanted to make it
 

00:03:55.430 --> 00:03:57.670
writing a paper and I wanted to make it
you know real science and I wanted to

00:03:57.670 --> 00:03:57.680
you know real science and I wanted to
 

00:03:57.680 --> 00:03:59.469
you know real science and I wanted to
tell people you know what sort of a

00:03:59.469 --> 00:03:59.479
tell people you know what sort of a
 

00:03:59.479 --> 00:04:01.240
tell people you know what sort of a
classification system I was using for

00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:01.250
classification system I was using for
 

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:02.949
classification system I was using for
breaking up my data into different

00:04:02.949 --> 00:04:02.959
breaking up my data into different
 

00:04:02.959 --> 00:04:05.979
breaking up my data into different
classes and so I went online as you do

00:04:05.979 --> 00:04:05.989
classes and so I went online as you do
 

00:04:05.989 --> 00:04:10.089
classes and so I went online as you do
and try to Google for you know the

00:04:10.089 --> 00:04:10.099
and try to Google for you know the
 

00:04:10.099 --> 00:04:11.530
and try to Google for you know the
algorithm that was being used in the

00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:11.540
algorithm that was being used in the
 

00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:12.789
algorithm that was being used in the
software that I was using at the time

00:04:12.789 --> 00:04:12.799
software that I was using at the time
 

00:04:12.799 --> 00:04:14.530
software that I was using at the time
and since I guess we're not allowed to

00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:14.540
and since I guess we're not allowed to
 

00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:16.569
and since I guess we're not allowed to
say it's in their name today it's on the

00:04:16.569 --> 00:04:16.579
say it's in their name today it's on the
 

00:04:16.579 --> 00:04:20.319
say it's in their name today it's on the
screen there so you can figure so I

00:04:20.319 --> 00:04:20.329
screen there so you can figure so I
 

00:04:20.329 --> 00:04:21.819
screen there so you can figure so I
wanted to figure out what it was so I

00:04:21.819 --> 00:04:21.829
wanted to figure out what it was so I
 

00:04:21.829 --> 00:04:25.089
wanted to figure out what it was so I
looked at I found this forum post does

00:04:25.089 --> 00:04:25.099
looked at I found this forum post does
 

00:04:25.099 --> 00:04:26.709

Ricks seems like a pretty reasonable

00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:30.210
Ricks seems like a pretty reasonable
 

00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:32.270
Ricks seems like a pretty reasonable
question and potentially quite important

00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:32.280
question and potentially quite important
 

00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:34.220
question and potentially quite important
given that these two versions of the

given that these two versions of the
 

00:04:34.230 --> 00:04:35.870
given that these two versions of the
algorithm produce different results and

00:04:35.870 --> 00:04:35.880
algorithm produce different results and
 

00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:38.240
algorithm produce different results and
so the response was and there were some

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:38.250
so the response was and there were some
 

00:04:38.250 --> 00:04:40.010
so the response was and there were some
helpful responses and you know sort of

00:04:40.010 --> 00:04:40.020
helpful responses and you know sort of
 

00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:41.540
helpful responses and you know sort of
yeah we'd like to help you but that's

00:04:41.540 --> 00:04:41.550
yeah we'd like to help you but that's
 

00:04:41.550 --> 00:04:43.760
yeah we'd like to help you but that's
proprietary information along the lines

00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:43.770
proprietary information along the lines
 

00:04:43.770 --> 00:04:45.410
proprietary information along the lines
of a trade secret and so our policy is

00:04:45.410 --> 00:04:45.420
of a trade secret and so our policy is
 

00:04:45.420 --> 00:04:47.810
of a trade secret and so our policy is
that we don't share that so that was

00:04:47.810 --> 00:04:47.820
that we don't share that so that was
 

00:04:47.820 --> 00:04:49.460
that we don't share that so that was
very frustrating because now I'm going

00:04:49.460 --> 00:04:49.470
very frustrating because now I'm going
 

00:04:49.470 --> 00:04:51.200
very frustrating because now I'm going
to try and produce some research and I

00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:51.210
to try and produce some research and I
 

00:04:51.210 --> 00:04:54.830
to try and produce some research and I
can't actually tell anybody for sure how

00:04:54.830 --> 00:04:54.840
can't actually tell anybody for sure how
 

00:04:54.840 --> 00:04:57.410
can't actually tell anybody for sure how
I'm actually producing that research and

00:04:57.410 --> 00:04:57.420
I'm actually producing that research and
 

00:04:57.420 --> 00:04:58.790
I'm actually producing that research and
so I felt like this is not real science

00:04:58.790 --> 00:04:58.800
so I felt like this is not real science
 

00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:00.970
so I felt like this is not real science
this this is something so you know I

00:05:00.970 --> 00:05:00.980
this this is something so you know I
 

00:05:00.980 --> 00:05:03.530
this this is something so you know I
decided as a sort of someone who's in a

00:05:03.530 --> 00:05:03.540
decided as a sort of someone who's in a
 

00:05:03.540 --> 00:05:05.570
decided as a sort of someone who's in a
bit of a nerd I decided well I'll just

00:05:05.570 --> 00:05:05.580
bit of a nerd I decided well I'll just
 

00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:08.210
bit of a nerd I decided well I'll just
code up this algorithm myself yeah using

00:05:08.210 --> 00:05:08.220
code up this algorithm myself yeah using
 

00:05:08.220 --> 00:05:09.710
code up this algorithm myself yeah using
open source software and hey that's

00:05:09.710 --> 00:05:09.720
open source software and hey that's
 

00:05:09.720 --> 00:05:11.000
open source software and hey that's
great and everybody should do that

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:11.010
great and everybody should do that
 

00:05:11.010 --> 00:05:13.460
great and everybody should do that
except that not everybody wants to do

00:05:13.460 --> 00:05:13.470
except that not everybody wants to do
 

00:05:13.470 --> 00:05:16.220
except that not everybody wants to do
that and so there's this sort of tension

00:05:16.220 --> 00:05:16.230
that and so there's this sort of tension
 

00:05:16.230 --> 00:05:17.960
that and so there's this sort of tension
here right that I I decided it was very

00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:17.970
here right that I I decided it was very
 

00:05:17.970 --> 00:05:19.400
here right that I I decided it was very
important for me to do that so I did it

00:05:19.400 --> 00:05:19.410
important for me to do that so I did it
 

00:05:19.410 --> 00:05:20.990
important for me to do that so I did it
and I published a paper and I could tell

00:05:20.990 --> 00:05:21.000
and I published a paper and I could tell
 

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:23.810
and I published a paper and I could tell
you exactly what algorithm was used to

00:05:23.810 --> 00:05:23.820
you exactly what algorithm was used to
 

00:05:23.820 --> 00:05:26.120
you exactly what algorithm was used to
do the classification but this isn't an

00:05:26.120 --> 00:05:26.130
do the classification but this isn't an
 

00:05:26.130 --> 00:05:27.770
do the classification but this isn't an
issue or isn't a possibility for a lot

00:05:27.770 --> 00:05:27.780
issue or isn't a possibility for a lot
 

00:05:27.780 --> 00:05:29.780
issue or isn't a possibility for a lot
of people and so that's another issue of

00:05:29.780 --> 00:05:29.790
of people and so that's another issue of
 

00:05:29.790 --> 00:05:31.400
of people and so that's another issue of
openness I'd like to talk a little bit

00:05:31.400 --> 00:05:31.410
openness I'd like to talk a little bit
 

00:05:31.410 --> 00:05:35.000
openness I'd like to talk a little bit
about today and so that's kind of that

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:35.010
about today and so that's kind of that
 

00:05:35.010 --> 00:05:38.300
about today and so that's kind of that
and some discussions actually at an a AG

00:05:38.300 --> 00:05:38.310
and some discussions actually at an a AG
 

00:05:38.310 --> 00:05:40.730
and some discussions actually at an a AG
workshop not that long ago year or two

00:05:40.730 --> 00:05:40.740
workshop not that long ago year or two
 

00:05:40.740 --> 00:05:43.490
workshop not that long ago year or two
ago about open GIS started getting me to

00:05:43.490 --> 00:05:43.500
ago about open GIS started getting me to
 

00:05:43.500 --> 00:05:46.400
ago about open GIS started getting me to
admit that maybe there are some it's not

00:05:46.400 --> 00:05:46.410
admit that maybe there are some it's not
 

00:05:46.410 --> 00:05:48.250
admit that maybe there are some it's not
this sort of yes or no open kind of

00:05:48.250 --> 00:05:48.260
this sort of yes or no open kind of
 

00:05:48.260 --> 00:05:51.800
this sort of yes or no open kind of
question there is a a continuum openness

00:05:51.800 --> 00:05:51.810
question there is a a continuum openness
 

00:05:51.810 --> 00:05:53.600
question there is a a continuum openness
and so this picture here is supposed to

00:05:53.600 --> 00:05:53.610
and so this picture here is supposed to
 

00:05:53.610 --> 00:05:55.640
and so this picture here is supposed to
suggest that over time along the road of

00:05:55.640 --> 00:05:55.650
suggest that over time along the road of
 

00:05:55.650 --> 00:05:57.500
suggest that over time along the road of
my career I discovered maybe there's

00:05:57.500 --> 00:05:57.510
my career I discovered maybe there's
 

00:05:57.510 --> 00:05:59.360
my career I discovered maybe there's
actually a sort of continuum of openness

00:05:59.360 --> 00:05:59.370
actually a sort of continuum of openness
 

00:05:59.370 --> 00:06:00.830
actually a sort of continuum of openness
right not everybody has to be able to

00:06:00.830 --> 00:06:00.840
right not everybody has to be able to
 

00:06:00.840 --> 00:06:03.590
right not everybody has to be able to
write their own algorithms in order to

00:06:03.590 --> 00:06:03.600
write their own algorithms in order to
 

00:06:03.600 --> 00:06:06.320
write their own algorithms in order to
be open in order to be doing some aspect

00:06:06.320 --> 00:06:06.330
be open in order to be doing some aspect
 

00:06:06.330 --> 00:06:09.260
be open in order to be doing some aspect
of open science open GIS using open data

00:06:09.260 --> 00:06:09.270
of open science open GIS using open data
 

00:06:09.270 --> 00:06:11.330
of open science open GIS using open data
so it's this continuum and I kind of

00:06:11.330 --> 00:06:11.340
so it's this continuum and I kind of
 

00:06:11.340 --> 00:06:13.490
so it's this continuum and I kind of
want to talk about that today as a

00:06:13.490 --> 00:06:13.500
want to talk about that today as a
 

00:06:13.500 --> 00:06:16.520
want to talk about that today as a
potential discussion topic and and I'm

00:06:16.520 --> 00:06:16.530
potential discussion topic and and I'm
 

00:06:16.530 --> 00:06:17.660
potential discussion topic and and I'm
not the only person who thinks about

00:06:17.660 --> 00:06:17.670
not the only person who thinks about
 

00:06:17.670 --> 00:06:20.360
not the only person who thinks about
these kinds of ideas there are lots of

00:06:20.360 --> 00:06:20.370
these kinds of ideas there are lots of
 

00:06:20.370 --> 00:06:22.250
these kinds of ideas there are lots of
you know lots of others talking about

00:06:22.250 --> 00:06:22.260
you know lots of others talking about
 

00:06:22.260 --> 00:06:25.580
you know lots of others talking about
this idea of openness and I'm talking

00:06:25.580 --> 00:06:25.590
this idea of openness and I'm talking
 

00:06:25.590 --> 00:06:27.590
this idea of openness and I'm talking
specifically about sort of the openness

00:06:27.590 --> 00:06:27.600
specifically about sort of the openness
 

00:06:27.600 --> 00:06:32.420
specifically about sort of the openness
of product sword-like so openness of GIS

00:06:32.420 --> 00:06:32.430
of product sword-like so openness of GIS
 

00:06:32.430 --> 00:06:33.890
of product sword-like so openness of GIS
openness of data openness of

00:06:33.890 --> 00:06:33.900
openness of data openness of
 

00:06:33.900 --> 00:06:35.780
openness of data openness of
collaboration there's a lot of different

00:06:35.780 --> 00:06:35.790
collaboration there's a lot of different
 

00:06:35.790 --> 00:06:38.540
collaboration there's a lot of different
ways that we can talk about this but in

00:06:38.540 --> 00:06:38.550
ways that we can talk about this but in
 

00:06:38.550 --> 00:06:41.230
ways that we can talk about this but in
the literature people like to have

00:06:41.230 --> 00:06:41.240
the literature people like to have
 

00:06:41.240 --> 00:06:43.270
the literature people like to have
letters that repeat alliteration is

00:06:43.270 --> 00:06:43.280
letters that repeat alliteration is
 

00:06:43.280 --> 00:06:44.469
letters that repeat alliteration is
always really great if you can do that

00:06:44.469 --> 00:06:44.479
always really great if you can do that
 

00:06:44.479 --> 00:06:45.820
always really great if you can do that
because it can drive your point home a

00:06:45.820 --> 00:06:45.830
because it can drive your point home a
 

00:06:45.830 --> 00:06:46.629
because it can drive your point home a
little bit better

00:06:46.629 --> 00:06:46.639
little bit better
 

00:06:46.639 --> 00:06:49.659
little bit better
comedians use it a lot as well and so

00:06:49.659 --> 00:06:49.669
comedians use it a lot as well and so
 

00:06:49.669 --> 00:06:53.320
comedians use it a lot as well and so
we've got this sort of big the four V's

00:06:53.320 --> 00:06:53.330
we've got this sort of big the four V's
 

00:06:53.330 --> 00:06:55.180
we've got this sort of big the four V's
of Big Data and we've got the four R's

00:06:55.180 --> 00:06:55.190
of Big Data and we've got the four R's
 

00:06:55.190 --> 00:06:59.020
of Big Data and we've got the four R's
of openness and so if you really want to

00:06:59.020 --> 00:06:59.030
of openness and so if you really want to
 

00:06:59.030 --> 00:07:02.650
of openness and so if you really want to
make an impact you need alliteration but

00:07:02.650 --> 00:07:02.660
make an impact you need alliteration but
 

00:07:02.660 --> 00:07:05.230
make an impact you need alliteration but
basically idea is that in order for

00:07:05.230 --> 00:07:05.240
basically idea is that in order for
 

00:07:05.240 --> 00:07:07.180
basically idea is that in order for
something to be open a resource be it

00:07:07.180 --> 00:07:07.190
something to be open a resource be it
 

00:07:07.190 --> 00:07:10.920
something to be open a resource be it

00:07:10.930 --> 00:07:14.710
software data communication tool a
communication system it should be freely

00:07:14.710 --> 00:07:14.720
communication system it should be freely
 

00:07:14.720 --> 00:07:16.270
communication system it should be freely
available to others to reuse in

00:07:16.270 --> 00:07:16.280
available to others to reuse in
 

00:07:16.280 --> 00:07:18.100
available to others to reuse in
different contexts that's kind of like

00:07:18.100 --> 00:07:18.110
different contexts that's kind of like
 

00:07:18.110 --> 00:07:19.960
different contexts that's kind of like
the baseline requirement for something

00:07:19.960 --> 00:07:19.970
the baseline requirement for something
 

00:07:19.970 --> 00:07:21.400
the baseline requirement for something
to be open all right

00:07:21.400 --> 00:07:21.410
to be open all right
 

00:07:21.410 --> 00:07:22.960
to be open all right
even communication right you need to be

00:07:22.960 --> 00:07:22.970
even communication right you need to be
 

00:07:22.970 --> 00:07:24.820
even communication right you need to be
able to freely exchange ideas to others

00:07:24.820 --> 00:07:24.830
able to freely exchange ideas to others
 

00:07:24.830 --> 00:07:26.290
able to freely exchange ideas to others
and they need to be able to use those

00:07:26.290 --> 00:07:26.300
and they need to be able to use those
 

00:07:26.300 --> 00:07:28.150
and they need to be able to use those

right if I'm having a conversation with
 

00:07:30.110 --> 00:07:31.839
right if I'm having a conversation with
someone then I need to be able to do

these things just as much as if I'm

00:07:33.370 --> 00:07:33.380
these things just as much as if I'm
 

00:07:33.380 --> 00:07:34.749
these things just as much as if I'm
going to be using a piece of software to

things okay so this is this idea of the
 

00:07:45.919 --> 00:07:48.339
things okay so this is this idea of the
three three r's of openness all right so

00:07:48.339 --> 00:07:48.349
three three r's of openness all right so
 

00:07:48.349 --> 00:07:49.480

today if we have time is this idea that
 

00:08:39.099 --> 00:08:41.409
today if we have time is this idea that
this is probably just a really great

00:08:41.409 --> 00:08:41.419
this is probably just a really great
 

00:08:41.419 --> 00:08:43.360
this is probably just a really great
thing right there are all of these open

00:08:43.360 --> 00:08:43.370
thing right there are all of these open
 

00:08:43.370 --> 00:08:45.910
thing right there are all of these open
data sources and open datasets or open

out there and it means that a lot more

00:08:51.939 --> 00:08:51.949
out there and it means that a lot more
 

00:08:51.949 --> 00:08:53.480

people are playing around with these

00:08:53.480 --> 00:08:53.490
people are playing around with these
 

00:08:53.490 --> 00:08:56.780
people are playing around with these
and most of them probably 99% of them

00:08:56.780 --> 00:08:56.790
and most of them probably 99% of them
 

00:08:56.790 --> 00:08:59.600

recent AAG conference there was some

00:09:10.220 --> 00:09:10.230
recent AAG conference there was some
 

00:09:10.230 --> 00:09:11.720
recent AAG conference there was some
people said well maybe we should take a

00:09:11.720 --> 00:09:11.730
people said well maybe we should take a
 

00:09:11.730 --> 00:09:14.090
people said well maybe we should take a
step back and say no like let's not let

00:09:14.090 --> 00:09:14.100
step back and say no like let's not let
 

00:09:14.100 --> 00:09:15.500
step back and say no like let's not let
all these people make these maps because

00:09:15.500 --> 00:09:15.510
all these people make these maps because
 

00:09:15.510 --> 00:09:17.449
all these people make these maps because
they're doing it wrong and I thought

00:09:17.449 --> 00:09:17.459
they're doing it wrong and I thought
 

00:09:17.459 --> 00:09:18.889
they're doing it wrong and I thought
that was a super scary thought

00:09:18.889 --> 00:09:18.899
that was a super scary thought
 

00:09:18.899 --> 00:09:20.510
that was a super scary thought
right this whole idea of openness is

00:09:20.510 --> 00:09:20.520
right this whole idea of openness is
 

00:09:20.520 --> 00:09:22.880
right this whole idea of openness is
that if we have a thousand really bad

00:09:22.880 --> 00:09:22.890
that if we have a thousand really bad
 

00:09:22.890 --> 00:09:25.190
that if we have a thousand really bad
maps and one good one that's much better

00:09:25.190 --> 00:09:25.200
maps and one good one that's much better
 

00:09:25.200 --> 00:09:27.170
maps and one good one that's much better
than a couple of good ones and nothing

00:09:27.170 --> 00:09:27.180
than a couple of good ones and nothing
 

00:09:27.180 --> 00:09:29.269
than a couple of good ones and nothing
else as far as I'm concerned so the idea

00:09:29.269 --> 00:09:29.279
else as far as I'm concerned so the idea
 

00:09:29.279 --> 00:09:31.850
else as far as I'm concerned so the idea
that the ability to reuse revise remix

00:09:31.850 --> 00:09:31.860
that the ability to reuse revise remix
 

00:09:31.860 --> 00:09:34.400
that the ability to reuse revise remix
and redistribute things in ways that

00:09:34.400 --> 00:09:34.410
and redistribute things in ways that
 

00:09:34.410 --> 00:09:35.990
and redistribute things in ways that

we really have seen a change in the

00:10:00.980 --> 00:10:00.990
we really have seen a change in the

00:10:04.220 --> 00:10:04.230
openness landscape in terms of software
 

00:10:04.230 --> 00:10:06.440
openness landscape in terms of software
in terms of data and in definitely in

in terms of data and in definitely in
 

00:10:06.450 --> 00:10:08.660
in terms of data and in definitely in
terms of attitudes so it used to be that

them you know oh yeah open-source
software is great and his sort of come

00:10:18.980 --> 00:10:18.990
software is great and his sort of come
 

00:10:18.990 --> 00:10:20.600
software is great and his sort of come
back to that was like well you know

00:10:20.600 --> 00:10:20.610
back to that was like well you know
 

00:10:20.610 --> 00:10:23.180
back to that was like well you know
prove it why is it better why is it

00:10:23.180 --> 00:10:23.190
prove it why is it better why is it
 

00:10:23.190 --> 00:10:24.590
prove it why is it better why is it
better than a proprietary system that's

00:10:24.590 --> 00:10:24.600
better than a proprietary system that's
 

00:10:24.600 --> 00:10:26.120
better than a proprietary system that's
you have to in order you have to be able

00:10:26.120 --> 00:10:26.130
you have to in order you have to be able
 

00:10:26.130 --> 00:10:27.920
you have to in order you have to be able
to justify that in order to say it's

00:10:27.920 --> 00:10:27.930
to justify that in order to say it's
 

00:10:27.930 --> 00:10:30.829
to justify that in order to say it's
better and my reaction to that is no I

00:10:30.829 --> 00:10:30.839
better and my reaction to that is no I
 

00:10:30.839 --> 00:10:31.940
better and my reaction to that is no I
don't think so actually

00:10:31.940 --> 00:10:31.950
don't think so actually
 

00:10:31.950 --> 00:10:35.269
don't think so actually
we as a society value transparency and

00:10:35.269 --> 00:10:35.279
we as a society value transparency and
 

00:10:35.279 --> 00:10:36.860
we as a society value transparency and
openness we clearly do otherwise we

00:10:36.860 --> 00:10:36.870
openness we clearly do otherwise we
 

00:10:36.870 --> 00:10:39.050
openness we clearly do otherwise we
wouldn't be promoting open data access

00:10:39.050 --> 00:10:39.060
wouldn't be promoting open data access
 

00:10:39.060 --> 00:10:42.199
wouldn't be promoting open data access
open and transparent government and

00:10:42.199 --> 00:10:42.209
open and transparent government and
 

00:10:42.209 --> 00:10:44.210
open and transparent government and
things like that so there is actually no

00:10:44.210 --> 00:10:44.220
things like that so there is actually no
 

00:10:44.220 --> 00:10:47.300
things like that so there is actually no
need to justify this idea of openness

00:10:47.300 --> 00:10:47.310
need to justify this idea of openness
 

00:10:47.310 --> 00:10:49.670
need to justify this idea of openness
and access to things it's a it's a thing

00:10:49.670 --> 00:10:49.680
and access to things it's a it's a thing
 

00:10:49.680 --> 00:10:52.220
and access to things it's a it's a thing
that we value as a society so it doesn't

00:10:52.220 --> 00:10:52.230
that we value as a society so it doesn't
 

00:10:52.230 --> 00:10:54.190
that we value as a society so it doesn't
need to meet the same criteria as a

00:10:54.190 --> 00:10:54.200
need to meet the same criteria as a
 

00:10:54.200 --> 00:10:56.360
need to meet the same criteria as a
proprietary software company as a

00:10:56.360 --> 00:10:56.370
proprietary software company as a
 

00:10:56.370 --> 00:10:58.310
proprietary software company as a
business model it's just a good idea

00:10:58.310 --> 00:10:58.320
business model it's just a good idea
 

00:10:58.320 --> 00:11:00.829
business model it's just a good idea
right so and I think that we've seen

00:11:00.829 --> 00:11:00.839
right so and I think that we've seen
 

00:11:00.839 --> 00:11:03.530
right so and I think that we've seen
that that sort of attitude change quite

00:11:03.530 --> 00:11:03.540
that that sort of attitude change quite
 

00:11:03.540 --> 00:11:04.590
that that sort of attitude change quite
a bit

00:11:04.590 --> 00:11:04.600
a bit
 

00:11:04.600 --> 00:11:07.440
a bit
in fact I have a number here numbers are

00:11:07.440 --> 00:11:07.450
in fact I have a number here numbers are
 

00:11:07.450 --> 00:11:07.740
in fact I have a number here numbers are
good

00:11:07.740 --> 00:11:07.750
good
 

00:11:07.750 --> 00:11:11.070
good
78% of companies now run on some form of

78% of companies now run on some form of
 

00:11:11.080 --> 00:11:13.560
78% of companies now run on some form of
open source software so this is from

00:11:13.560 --> 00:11:13.570
open source software so this is from
 

00:11:13.570 --> 00:11:15.120
open source software so this is from
somewhere in their sort of software

00:11:15.120 --> 00:11:15.130
somewhere in their sort of software
 

00:11:15.130 --> 00:11:17.310

know there's a source at the bottom if

00:11:20.970 --> 00:11:20.980
know there's a source at the bottom if
 

00:11:20.980 --> 00:11:24.030
know there's a source at the bottom if
you don't believe me 78% of companies

00:11:24.030 --> 00:11:24.040
you don't believe me 78% of companies
 

00:11:24.040 --> 00:11:26.220
you don't believe me 78% of companies
running an open source software and 65%

00:11:26.220 --> 00:11:26.230
running an open source software and 65%
 

00:11:26.230 --> 00:11:29.220
running an open source software and 65%
of Americans over the last year have

00:11:29.220 --> 00:11:29.230
of Americans over the last year have
 

00:11:29.230 --> 00:11:32.310
of Americans over the last year have
used online open data portals to access

00:11:32.310 --> 00:11:32.320
used online open data portals to access
 

00:11:32.320 --> 00:11:34.410
used online open data portals to access
information about their government right

00:11:34.410 --> 00:11:34.420
information about their government right
 

00:11:34.420 --> 00:11:37.260
information about their government right
which is you know 65% that's quite a lot

00:11:37.260 --> 00:11:37.270
which is you know 65% that's quite a lot
 

00:11:37.270 --> 00:11:38.730
which is you know 65% that's quite a lot
that's people who are interested in

00:11:38.730 --> 00:11:38.740
that's people who are interested in
 

00:11:38.740 --> 00:11:40.440
that's people who are interested in
accessing information in order to learn

00:11:40.440 --> 00:11:40.450
accessing information in order to learn
 

00:11:40.450 --> 00:11:42.840
accessing information in order to learn
something about the government I should

00:11:42.840 --> 00:11:42.850
something about the government I should
 

00:11:42.850 --> 00:11:44.310
something about the government I should
mention that only 5% of those people

00:11:44.310 --> 00:11:44.320
mention that only 5% of those people
 

00:11:44.320 --> 00:11:47.250
mention that only 5% of those people
think that their access is sufficient to

00:11:47.250 --> 00:11:47.260
think that their access is sufficient to
 

00:11:47.260 --> 00:11:49.470
think that their access is sufficient to
this type of information okay so lots of

00:11:49.470 --> 00:11:49.480
this type of information okay so lots of
 

00:11:49.480 --> 00:11:50.880
this type of information okay so lots of
people want to do it but most people

00:11:50.880 --> 00:11:50.890
people want to do it but most people
 

00:11:50.890 --> 00:11:52.830
people want to do it but most people
don't think it's good enough to do it

00:11:52.830 --> 00:11:52.840
don't think it's good enough to do it
 

00:11:52.840 --> 00:11:56.250
don't think it's good enough to do it
and so that brings me to this an

00:11:56.250 --> 00:11:56.260
and so that brings me to this an
 

00:11:56.260 --> 00:11:57.990
and so that brings me to this an
important idea which is structural

00:11:57.990 --> 00:11:58.000
important idea which is structural
 

00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:01.560
important idea which is structural
issues of openness so even if we make

00:12:01.560 --> 00:12:01.570
issues of openness so even if we make
 

00:12:01.570 --> 00:12:03.690
issues of openness so even if we make
something available online as a PDF

00:12:03.690 --> 00:12:03.700
something available online as a PDF
 

00:12:03.700 --> 00:12:05.400
something available online as a PDF
right it doesn't mean that we actually

00:12:05.400 --> 00:12:05.410
right it doesn't mean that we actually
 

00:12:05.410 --> 00:12:08.070
right it doesn't mean that we actually
have access to it and many of the people

00:12:08.070 --> 00:12:08.080
have access to it and many of the people
 

00:12:08.080 --> 00:12:09.660
have access to it and many of the people
who we want to have access to this

00:12:09.660 --> 00:12:09.670
who we want to have access to this
 

00:12:09.670 --> 00:12:11.700
who we want to have access to this
information don't have a degree in

00:12:11.700 --> 00:12:11.710
information don't have a degree in
 

00:12:11.710 --> 00:12:13.260
information don't have a degree in
computer science in order to parse the

00:12:13.260 --> 00:12:13.270
computer science in order to parse the
 

00:12:13.270 --> 00:12:15.510
computer science in order to parse the
CSV file and make a map and view it

00:12:15.510 --> 00:12:15.520
CSV file and make a map and view it
 

00:12:15.520 --> 00:12:17.400
CSV file and make a map and view it
online in the first place and there are

00:12:17.400 --> 00:12:17.410
online in the first place and there are
 

00:12:17.410 --> 00:12:18.690
online in the first place and there are
a bunch of communities particularly in

00:12:18.690 --> 00:12:18.700
a bunch of communities particularly in
 

00:12:18.700 --> 00:12:20.790
a bunch of communities particularly in
New York like this meetup group called

00:12:20.790 --> 00:12:20.800
New York like this meetup group called
 

00:12:20.800 --> 00:12:22.680
New York like this meetup group called
beta NYC who have lowered the barrier

00:12:22.680 --> 00:12:22.690
beta NYC who have lowered the barrier
 

00:12:22.690 --> 00:12:25.230
beta NYC who have lowered the barrier
for so many data sets in the city to the

00:12:25.230 --> 00:12:25.240
for so many data sets in the city to the
 

00:12:25.240 --> 00:12:27.360
for so many data sets in the city to the
point where most people can actually

00:12:27.360 --> 00:12:27.370
point where most people can actually
 

00:12:27.370 --> 00:12:28.740
point where most people can actually
interact with some data and that's

00:12:28.740 --> 00:12:28.750
interact with some data and that's
 

00:12:28.750 --> 00:12:30.630
interact with some data and that's
fantastic but that's something that I

00:12:30.630 --> 00:12:30.640
fantastic but that's something that I
 

00:12:30.640 --> 00:12:32.070
fantastic but that's something that I
think and laxmi was talking about this

00:12:32.070 --> 00:12:32.080
think and laxmi was talking about this
 

00:12:32.080 --> 00:12:33.750
think and laxmi was talking about this
as well that's something I think that we

00:12:33.750 --> 00:12:33.760
as well that's something I think that we
 

00:12:33.760 --> 00:12:35.730
as well that's something I think that we
really need to address now as an open

00:12:35.730 --> 00:12:35.740
really need to address now as an open
 

00:12:35.740 --> 00:12:38.790
really need to address now as an open
people interested in open data is now

00:12:38.790 --> 00:12:38.800
people interested in open data is now
 

00:12:38.800 --> 00:12:40.320
people interested in open data is now
the data is out there and that's great

00:12:40.320 --> 00:12:40.330
the data is out there and that's great
 

00:12:40.330 --> 00:12:42.570
the data is out there and that's great
right and now we have the software that

00:12:42.570 --> 00:12:42.580
right and now we have the software that
 

00:12:42.580 --> 00:12:44.850
right and now we have the software that
everybody can mix and match together but

00:12:44.850 --> 00:12:44.860
everybody can mix and match together but
 

00:12:44.860 --> 00:12:47.940
everybody can mix and match together but
not everybody has access to the skills

00:12:47.940 --> 00:12:47.950
not everybody has access to the skills
 

00:12:47.950 --> 00:12:50.640
not everybody has access to the skills
and ideas required so access to these

00:12:50.640 --> 00:12:50.650
and ideas required so access to these
 

00:12:50.650 --> 00:12:52.800
and ideas required so access to these
open products is not uniform by any

00:12:52.800 --> 00:12:52.810
open products is not uniform by any
 

00:12:52.810 --> 00:12:55.440
open products is not uniform by any
stretch of the imagination I can grab

00:12:55.440 --> 00:12:55.450
stretch of the imagination I can grab
 

00:12:55.450 --> 00:12:57.150
stretch of the imagination I can grab
some source code and modify it to look

00:12:57.150 --> 00:12:57.160
some source code and modify it to look
 

00:12:57.160 --> 00:12:59.670
some source code and modify it to look
at my at some particular geospatial

00:12:59.670 --> 00:12:59.680
at my at some particular geospatial
 

00:12:59.680 --> 00:13:02.160
at my at some particular geospatial
algorithm but my mom can't do that and

00:13:02.160 --> 00:13:02.170
algorithm but my mom can't do that and
 

00:13:02.170 --> 00:13:03.990
algorithm but my mom can't do that and
I'd still like her to be as informed

00:13:03.990 --> 00:13:04.000
I'd still like her to be as informed
 

00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:05.070
I'd still like her to be as informed
about what's going on in her community

00:13:05.070 --> 00:13:05.080
about what's going on in her community
 

00:13:05.080 --> 00:13:09.060
about what's going on in her community
as I am if I want to be right so here

00:13:09.060 --> 00:13:09.070
as I am if I want to be right so here
 

00:13:09.070 --> 00:13:11.190
as I am if I want to be right so here
are a few discussion points that we

00:13:11.190 --> 00:13:11.200
are a few discussion points that we
 

00:13:11.200 --> 00:13:12.840
are a few discussion points that we
could touch on that I've kind of touched

00:13:12.840 --> 00:13:12.850
could touch on that I've kind of touched
 

00:13:12.850 --> 00:13:14.670
could touch on that I've kind of touched
on a little bit in my class and you'll

00:13:14.670 --> 00:13:14.680
on a little bit in my class and you'll
 

00:13:14.680 --> 00:13:17.400
on a little bit in my class and you'll
notice that I have used a visual

00:13:17.400 --> 00:13:17.410
notice that I have used a visual
 

00:13:17.410 --> 00:13:20.180
notice that I have used a visual
style based on the least open

00:13:20.180 --> 00:13:20.190
style based on the least open
 

00:13:20.190 --> 00:13:22.199
style based on the least open
communication medium possible which is

00:13:22.199 --> 00:13:22.209
communication medium possible which is
 

00:13:22.209 --> 00:13:25.079
communication medium possible which is
an iPhone so there you go some little

00:13:25.079 --> 00:13:25.089
an iPhone so there you go some little
 

00:13:25.089 --> 00:13:26.220
an iPhone so there you go some little
bit of irony for you get in the

00:13:26.220 --> 00:13:26.230
bit of irony for you get in the
 

00:13:26.230 --> 00:13:29.090
bit of irony for you get in the
afternoon thanks very much

00:13:29.090 --> 00:13:29.100
