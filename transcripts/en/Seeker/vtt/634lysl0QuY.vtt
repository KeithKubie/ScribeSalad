00:00:00.089 --> 00:00:02.649
Are you a glass half full or half empty kind
of person?

00:00:02.649 --> 00:00:09.880
I’m gonna go ahead and guess half full,
especially if you’re a chimp.

00:00:09.880 --> 00:00:12.880
Hey everyone Julia here for DNews.

00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:16.970
Have you ever scrolled through a streaming
website site, searching for the perfect movie

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:18.199
and just can’t choose?

00:00:18.199 --> 00:00:19.390
Do you just give up?

00:00:19.390 --> 00:00:23.070
You’re not alone- too many options seems
overwhelming to us.

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:28.100
A study published in the Journal of Personality
and Social Psychology over ten years ago put

00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:29.590
this idea to the test.

00:00:29.590 --> 00:00:32.669
You might know it as the famous “Paradox
of Choice” study.

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:34.210
Researchers set up two situations.

00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:39.170
One in which people chose from 6 varieties
of jam and the other from 24.

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:43.399
The larger display got more attention, but
only a tenth of the amount of purchases.

00:00:43.399 --> 00:00:47.030
The researchers conclude that too many options
turned off shoppers.

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:50.129
The cost of making a decision grows with each
new option.

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:52.710
With more choice comes more anxiety and regret.

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:54.240
What if I make the wrong choice?

00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:56.520
They felt too overwhelmed.

00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:01.370
So in a world full of too many choices, how
do retailers get you to choose their option?

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:02.370
Manipulation…

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:03.680
I mean marketing.

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:07.789
By framing one option that’s relatively
equal to all the others in a positive light,

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:09.530
we’re more likely to just go with it.

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:12.250
Maybe just to make the anxiety STOP.

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:16.329
Research shows that presenting the same information
in a positive frame yields better results

00:01:16.329 --> 00:01:17.899
than negatively framing it.

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:20.900
And it seems there’s not much you can do
about your susceptibility to it.

00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:22.569
It might be in your DNA.

00:01:22.569 --> 00:01:25.729
All things being equal people prefer a hopeful
spin.

00:01:25.729 --> 00:01:27.939
We like to think of our glasses as half full.

00:01:27.939 --> 00:01:29.740
This is called “framing”.

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:32.329
Humans above and beyond positive framing.

00:01:32.329 --> 00:01:37.149
They will choose the 75% lean steak rather
than the 25% fat one.

00:01:37.149 --> 00:01:39.469
Even though they’re exactly the same.

00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:42.990
Researchers used to think this was a result
of human culture, something to do with our

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:43.990
society.

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:48.289
But it turns our nearest primate relatives,
chimpanzees and bonobos like to look on the

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:49.950
bright side too.

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:52.560
Researchers framed food options for both our
nearest relatives, bonobos and chimps.

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:56.299
To “frame” in chimp language, they gave
them the option to chose a handful of nuts

00:01:56.299 --> 00:01:57.299
or fruit.

00:01:57.299 --> 00:02:01.459
In one trial the researchers framed the fruit
option positively by showing a smaller handful

00:02:01.459 --> 00:02:03.869
but sometimes giving an extra piece.

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:07.950
In another trial, the fruit was framed negatively,
sometimes they were shown a larger handful

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:09.909
but then actually received less.

00:02:09.909 --> 00:02:13.930
The chips had a preference for the option
framed as a prize, rather than an option framed

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:17.640
as a penalty, even when both options were
pretty much equal.

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:22.349
The researchers say this suggests that a positive
framing bias has more basis in our DNA than

00:02:22.349 --> 00:02:23.460
in our culture.

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:27.220
So with that in mind, we’ve got 2 videos
down here (point) for you to watch.

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:31.040
This one is okay, but you’re going to be
blown away by this one.

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:32.040
You should click it.

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:33.040
Go on, click it.
