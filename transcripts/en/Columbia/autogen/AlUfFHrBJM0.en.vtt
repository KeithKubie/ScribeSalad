we got the tools to do today but it'll

00:00:21.669 --> 00:00:21.679
we got the tools to do today but it'll
 

00:00:21.679 --> 00:00:23.800
we got the tools to do today but it'll
illustrate a few of the things that that

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:23.810
illustrate a few of the things that that
 

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:26.169

we we did in particular simultaneous

00:00:26.169 --> 00:00:26.179
we we did in particular simultaneous
 

00:00:26.179 --> 00:00:28.749
we we did in particular simultaneous
equations and also use of the

00:00:28.749 --> 00:00:28.759
equations and also use of the
 

00:00:28.759 --> 00:00:34.870
equations and also use of the
exponential function and that should

00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:34.880
exponential function and that should
 

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:37.780
exponential function and that should
take us about 20 minutes and then we

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:37.790
take us about 20 minutes and then we
 

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:41.500
take us about 20 minutes and then we
will be done I will not I debated

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:41.510
will be done I will not I debated
 

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:44.170
will be done I will not I debated
whether to start you on calculus tonight

00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:44.180
whether to start you on calculus tonight
 

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:48.570
whether to start you on calculus tonight
but I think that it's the first evening

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:48.580
but I think that it's the first evening
 

00:00:48.580 --> 00:00:53.470
but I think that it's the first evening
some people say are saying no and so

00:00:53.470 --> 00:00:53.480
some people say are saying no and so
 

00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:55.569
some people say are saying no and so
maybe it will start on calculus as

00:00:55.569 --> 00:00:55.579
maybe it will start on calculus as
 

00:00:55.579 --> 00:00:59.920
maybe it will start on calculus as
planned on on Thursday but we'll do this

00:00:59.920 --> 00:00:59.930
planned on on Thursday but we'll do this
 

00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:03.040
planned on on Thursday but we'll do this
this is actually not as as complicated

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:03.050
this is actually not as as complicated
 

00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:05.620
this is actually not as as complicated
as it sounds and it's very I like this

00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:05.630
as it sounds and it's very I like this
 

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:09.279
as it sounds and it's very I like this
example because it is very much about it

00:01:09.279 --> 00:01:09.289
example because it is very much about it
 

00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:13.679
example because it is very much about it
is very much a problem that often people

00:01:13.679 --> 00:01:13.689
is very much a problem that often people
 

00:01:13.689 --> 00:01:17.429
is very much a problem that often people
in this field have to deal with okay now

00:01:17.429 --> 00:01:17.439
in this field have to deal with okay now
 

00:01:17.439 --> 00:01:21.039
in this field have to deal with okay now
so this is a very common problem okay

00:01:21.039 --> 00:01:21.049
so this is a very common problem okay
 

00:01:21.049 --> 00:01:27.249
so this is a very common problem okay
and I've simplified it heavily here you

00:01:27.249 --> 00:01:27.259
and I've simplified it heavily here you
 

00:01:27.259 --> 00:01:31.149
and I've simplified it heavily here you
have to choose between a coal power

00:01:31.149 --> 00:01:31.159
have to choose between a coal power
 

00:01:31.159 --> 00:01:37.359
have to choose between a coal power

the main characteristic difference
 

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:43.679
the main characteristic difference
between the two is that a coal plant

00:01:43.679 --> 00:01:43.689
between the two is that a coal plant
 

00:01:43.689 --> 00:01:48.399
between the two is that a coal plant
requires much more capital investment a

00:01:48.399 --> 00:01:48.409
requires much more capital investment a
 

00:01:48.409 --> 00:01:52.889
requires much more capital investment a

it's

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:08.910
it's
 

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:13.110
it's
the plants are quite modular so capital

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:13.120
the plants are quite modular so capital
 

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:16.080
the plants are quite modular so capital

produced okay so which should you use

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:37.710
produced okay so which should you use
 

00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:41.520
produced okay so which should you use
well the answer is not obvious if you

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:41.530
well the answer is not obvious if you
 

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:48.170
well the answer is not obvious if you
are going to use it very little then you

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:48.180
are going to use it very little then you
 

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:51.840
are going to use it very little then you
don't care so much about the operating

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:51.850
don't care so much about the operating
 

00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:56.550
don't care so much about the operating
costs that is the variable cost so

00:02:56.550 --> 00:02:56.560
costs that is the variable cost so
 

00:02:56.560 --> 00:03:00.240
costs that is the variable cost so
you're probably going to go with which

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:00.250
you're probably going to go with which
 

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:03.210
you're probably going to go with which
technology the gas turbine right if

00:03:03.210 --> 00:03:03.220
technology the gas turbine right if
 

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:05.460
technology the gas turbine right if
you're going to use it a lot if you're

00:03:05.460 --> 00:03:05.470
you're going to use it a lot if you're
 

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:07.590
you're going to use it a lot if you're
going to use it all the time then you're

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:07.600
going to use it all the time then you're
 

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:09.900
going to use it all the time then you're
going to care about the operating costs

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:09.910
going to care about the operating costs
 

00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:11.670
going to care about the operating costs
the variable costs so you you're

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:11.680
the variable costs so you you're
 

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:13.680
the variable costs so you you're
probably going to go with the coal plant

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:13.690
probably going to go with the coal plant
 

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:16.890
probably going to go with the coal plant
okay the exact same problem comes up

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:16.900
okay the exact same problem comes up
 

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:23.300
okay the exact same problem comes up
with you know fuel-efficient cars versus

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:23.310
with you know fuel-efficient cars versus
 

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:28.040
with you know fuel-efficient cars versus
gas guzzlers right if you if you drive

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:28.050
gas guzzlers right if you if you drive
 

00:03:28.050 --> 00:03:31.440
gas guzzlers right if you if you drive
if you drive long distances to commute

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:31.450
if you drive long distances to commute
 

00:03:31.450 --> 00:03:34.850
if you drive long distances to commute
it pays to have a highly efficient car

00:03:34.850 --> 00:03:34.860
it pays to have a highly efficient car
 

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:40.110
it pays to have a highly efficient car
but if all you use your car for is the

00:03:40.110 --> 00:03:40.120
but if all you use your car for is the
 

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:43.260
but if all you use your car for is the
summer we can jaunt to the Berkshires or

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:43.270
summer we can jaunt to the Berkshires or
 

00:03:43.270 --> 00:03:49.610
summer we can jaunt to the Berkshires or
something then you know you might get a

00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:49.620
something then you know you might get a
 

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:57.510
something then you know you might get a
67 Mustang yes

00:03:57.510 --> 00:03:57.520
 

00:03:57.520 --> 00:04:02.560
it's sorry exhale Eric oh yeah so that's

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:02.570
it's sorry exhale Eric oh yeah so that's
 

00:04:02.570 --> 00:04:07.420
it's sorry exhale Eric oh yeah so that's
a very good question they are not in in

00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:07.430
a very good question they are not in in
 

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:13.620
a very good question they are not in in
these variable costs obviously so if

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:13.630
these variable costs obviously so if
 

00:04:13.630 --> 00:04:18.460
these variable costs obviously so if
permits were required which they are in

00:04:18.460 --> 00:04:18.470
permits were required which they are in
 

00:04:18.470 --> 00:04:22.950
permits were required which they are in
Europe but not in the US then the

00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:22.960
Europe but not in the US then the
 

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:26.409
Europe but not in the US then the
operating costs of the coal plant would

00:04:26.409 --> 00:04:26.419
operating costs of the coal plant would
 

00:04:26.419 --> 00:04:30.430
operating costs of the coal plant would
be higher and the operating costs of the

00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:30.440
be higher and the operating costs of the
 

00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:33.070
be higher and the operating costs of the
gas turbine would look relatively

00:04:33.070 --> 00:04:33.080
gas turbine would look relatively
 

00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:37.330
gas turbine would look relatively
cheaper or nuclear for example would

00:04:37.330 --> 00:04:37.340
cheaper or nuclear for example would
 

00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:48.040
cheaper or nuclear for example would
look even cheaper okay and sorry no no

00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:48.050
look even cheaper okay and sorry no no
 

00:04:48.050 --> 00:04:50.350
look even cheaper okay and sorry no no
they would be variable costs because

00:04:50.350 --> 00:04:50.360
they would be variable costs because
 

00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:52.630
they would be variable costs because
they would be associated with the total

00:04:52.630 --> 00:04:52.640
they would be associated with the total
 

00:04:52.640 --> 00:04:54.990
they would be associated with the total
amount o with the emissions generated

00:04:54.990 --> 00:04:55.000
amount o with the emissions generated
 

00:04:55.000 --> 00:05:01.060
amount o with the emissions generated
based on usage okay but there are also

00:05:01.060 --> 00:05:01.070
based on usage okay but there are also
 

00:05:01.070 --> 00:05:04.990
based on usage okay but there are also
ways to convert variable costs into

00:05:04.990 --> 00:05:05.000
ways to convert variable costs into
 

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:08.830
ways to convert variable costs into
fixed costs based on expected usage and

00:05:08.830 --> 00:05:08.840
fixed costs based on expected usage and
 

00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:10.630
fixed costs based on expected usage and
so on and we spend some time talking

00:05:10.630 --> 00:05:10.640
so on and we spend some time talking
 

00:05:10.640 --> 00:05:14.320
so on and we spend some time talking
about that in my class in the economics

00:05:14.320 --> 00:05:14.330
about that in my class in the economics
 

00:05:14.330 --> 00:05:16.570
about that in my class in the economics
class and also in professor Macomber

00:05:16.570 --> 00:05:16.580

suppose that the overnight cost of

00:05:44.680 --> 00:05:44.690
suppose that the overnight cost of
 

00:05:44.690 --> 00:05:46.330
suppose that the overnight cost of
building the coal power plant and the

00:05:46.330 --> 00:05:46.340
building the coal power plant and the
 

00:05:46.340 --> 00:05:48.340
building the coal power plant and the
gas turbine are given below so what's

00:05:48.340 --> 00:05:48.350
gas turbine are given below so what's
 

00:05:48.350 --> 00:05:50.830
gas turbine are given below so what's
the overnight cost anybody here with a

00:05:50.830 --> 00:05:50.840
the overnight cost anybody here with a
 

00:05:50.840 --> 00:05:56.740
the overnight cost anybody here with a
background in energy ok overnight cost

00:05:56.740 --> 00:05:56.750
background in energy ok overnight cost
 

00:05:56.750 --> 00:06:04.830
background in energy ok overnight cost
is the cost is the present value of

00:06:04.830 --> 00:06:04.840
is the cost is the present value of
 

00:06:04.840 --> 00:06:07.510
is the cost is the present value of
building of the present value of all the

struction costs as their incurred over

00:06:11.019 --> 00:06:11.029
struction costs as their incurred over
 

00:06:11.029 --> 00:06:15.309
struction costs as their incurred over
the construction period if you had to

00:06:15.309 --> 00:06:15.319
the construction period if you had to
 

00:06:15.319 --> 00:06:18.219
the construction period if you had to
make the plant come up overnight how

00:06:18.219 --> 00:06:18.229
make the plant come up overnight how
 

00:06:18.229 --> 00:06:21.489
make the plant come up overnight how
much money would you have to spend see a

00:06:21.489 --> 00:06:21.499
much money would you have to spend see a
 

00:06:21.499 --> 00:06:24.339
much money would you have to spend see a
gas turbine takes three months to put up

00:06:24.339 --> 00:06:24.349
gas turbine takes three months to put up
 

00:06:24.349 --> 00:06:28.449
gas turbine takes three months to put up
a coal plant takes a year so if I was

00:06:28.449 --> 00:06:28.459
a coal plant takes a year so if I was
 

00:06:28.459 --> 00:06:30.609
a coal plant takes a year so if I was
simply to add up all the construction

00:06:30.609 --> 00:06:30.619
simply to add up all the construction
 

00:06:30.619 --> 00:06:33.039
simply to add up all the construction
costs that I spend over the course of a

00:06:33.039 --> 00:06:33.049
costs that I spend over the course of a
 

00:06:33.049 --> 00:06:36.879
costs that I spend over the course of a
year and compare it to all the added

00:06:36.879 --> 00:06:36.889
year and compare it to all the added
 

00:06:36.889 --> 00:06:38.589
year and compare it to all the added
construction costs spent over the course

00:06:38.589 --> 00:06:38.599
construction costs spent over the course
 

00:06:38.599 --> 00:06:40.419
construction costs spent over the course
of three months then I would be

00:06:40.419 --> 00:06:40.429
of three months then I would be
 

00:06:40.429 --> 00:06:43.809
of three months then I would be
comparing apples to oranges especially

00:06:43.809 --> 00:06:43.819
comparing apples to oranges especially
 

00:06:43.819 --> 00:06:46.929
comparing apples to oranges especially
if interest rates were significant right

00:06:46.929 --> 00:06:46.939
if interest rates were significant right
 

00:06:46.939 --> 00:06:48.309
if interest rates were significant right
now of course interest rates are very

00:06:48.309 --> 00:06:48.319
now of course interest rates are very
 

00:06:48.319 --> 00:06:52.119
now of course interest rates are very
low but the appropriate interest rate it

00:06:52.119 --> 00:06:52.129
low but the appropriate interest rate it
 

00:06:52.129 --> 00:06:53.949
low but the appropriate interest rate it
turns out for this sort of problem is

00:06:53.949 --> 00:06:53.959
turns out for this sort of problem is
 

00:06:53.959 --> 00:06:57.069
turns out for this sort of problem is
not so much the risk-free rate which

00:06:57.069 --> 00:06:57.079
not so much the risk-free rate which
 

00:06:57.079 --> 00:07:00.699
not so much the risk-free rate which
right now is very low but a risky rate

00:07:00.699 --> 00:07:00.709
right now is very low but a risky rate
 

00:07:00.709 --> 00:07:02.979
right now is very low but a risky rate
which is generally significantly higher

00:07:02.979 --> 00:07:02.989
which is generally significantly higher
 

00:07:02.989 --> 00:07:04.989
which is generally significantly higher
and for these kinds of problems for

00:07:04.989 --> 00:07:04.999
and for these kinds of problems for
 

00:07:04.999 --> 00:07:07.889
and for these kinds of problems for
these kinds of investments is

00:07:07.889 --> 00:07:07.899
these kinds of investments is
 

00:07:07.899 --> 00:07:11.979
these kinds of investments is
substantial so so the overnight cost I

00:07:11.979 --> 00:07:11.989
substantial so so the overnight cost I
 

00:07:11.989 --> 00:07:13.569
substantial so so the overnight cost I
think I gave you the definition here

00:07:13.569 --> 00:07:13.579
think I gave you the definition here
 

00:07:13.579 --> 00:07:17.199
think I gave you the definition here
cost of the construction project if no

00:07:17.199 --> 00:07:17.209
cost of the construction project if no
 

00:07:17.209 --> 00:07:18.459
cost of the construction project if no
interest was incurred during

00:07:18.459 --> 00:07:18.469
interest was incurred during
 

00:07:18.469 --> 00:07:21.249
interest was incurred during
construction and as if the project was

00:07:21.249 --> 00:07:21.259
construction and as if the project was
 

00:07:21.259 --> 00:07:24.219
construction and as if the project was
completed overnight of course that's not

00:07:24.219 --> 00:07:24.229
completed overnight of course that's not
 

00:07:24.229 --> 00:07:27.369
completed overnight of course that's not
reality so what do to compute overnight

00:07:27.369 --> 00:07:27.379
reality so what do to compute overnight
 

00:07:27.379 --> 00:07:30.819
reality so what do to compute overnight
cost you take the present value of all

00:07:30.819 --> 00:07:30.829
cost you take the present value of all
 

00:07:30.829 --> 00:07:33.999
cost you take the present value of all
cash flows during construction it allows

00:07:33.999 --> 00:07:34.009
cash flows during construction it allows
 

00:07:34.009 --> 00:07:38.559
cash flows during construction it allows
you to compare construction costs across

00:07:38.559 --> 00:07:38.569
you to compare construction costs across
 

00:07:38.569 --> 00:07:41.759
you to compare construction costs across
technologies which have very different

00:07:41.759 --> 00:07:41.769
technologies which have very different
 

00:07:41.769 --> 00:07:45.939
technologies which have very different
time horizons construction periods okay

00:07:45.939 --> 00:07:45.949
time horizons construction periods okay
 

00:07:45.949 --> 00:07:49.649
time horizons construction periods okay
so here here the overnight costs and

00:07:49.649 --> 00:07:49.659
so here here the overnight costs and
 

00:07:49.659 --> 00:07:53.409
so here here the overnight costs and
those costs are expressed per kilowatt

00:07:53.409 --> 00:07:53.419
those costs are expressed per kilowatt
 

00:07:53.419 --> 00:08:00.999
those costs are expressed per kilowatt
of capacity okay so this is capacity not

00:08:00.999 --> 00:08:01.009
of capacity okay so this is capacity not
 

00:08:01.009 --> 00:08:06.029
of capacity okay so this is capacity not
electricity flow okay so this means that

00:08:06.029 --> 00:08:06.039
electricity flow okay so this means that
 

00:08:06.039 --> 00:08:14.229
electricity flow okay so this means that
if you if you built a megawatt power

00:08:14.229 --> 00:08:14.239
if you if you built a megawatt power
 

00:08:14.239 --> 00:08:16.029
if you if you built a megawatt power
plant that would be a very small power

00:08:16.029 --> 00:08:16.039
plant that would be a very small power
 

00:08:16.039 --> 00:08:21.399
plant that would be a very small power
plant right then you would

00:08:21.399 --> 00:08:21.409
plant right then you would
 

00:08:21.409 --> 00:08:24.929
plant right then you would
and a million dollars a million and

00:08:24.929 --> 00:08:24.939
and a million dollars a million and
 

00:08:24.939 --> 00:08:30.999
and a million dollars a million and
fifty thousand to build that okay and

00:08:30.999 --> 00:08:31.009
fifty thousand to build that okay and
 

00:08:31.009 --> 00:08:35.800
fifty thousand to build that okay and
you would spend 350,000 to build the gas

00:08:35.800 --> 00:08:35.810
you would spend 350,000 to build the gas
 

00:08:35.810 --> 00:08:42.100
you would spend 350,000 to build the gas
tube okay now so overnight costs you can

00:08:42.100 --> 00:08:42.110
tube okay now so overnight costs you can
 

00:08:42.110 --> 00:08:45.579
tube okay now so overnight costs you can
think of as the instantaneous capital

00:08:45.579 --> 00:08:45.589
think of as the instantaneous capital
 

00:08:45.589 --> 00:08:51.610
think of as the instantaneous capital
investment now what I'd like to do is to

00:08:51.610 --> 00:08:51.620
investment now what I'd like to do is to
 

00:08:51.620 --> 00:08:55.679
investment now what I'd like to do is to
convert that overnight cost into units

00:08:55.679 --> 00:08:55.689
convert that overnight cost into units
 

00:08:55.689 --> 00:09:01.319
convert that overnight cost into units
which are the same as the variable cost

00:09:01.319 --> 00:09:01.329
which are the same as the variable cost
 

00:09:01.329 --> 00:09:05.530
which are the same as the variable cost
okay the overnight cost is what I pay to

00:09:05.530 --> 00:09:05.540
okay the overnight cost is what I pay to
 

00:09:05.540 --> 00:09:09.550
okay the overnight cost is what I pay to
put a power plant up overnight now that

00:09:09.550 --> 00:09:09.560
put a power plant up overnight now that
 

00:09:09.560 --> 00:09:13.569
put a power plant up overnight now that
power plant has a useful life so it's

00:09:13.569 --> 00:09:13.579
power plant has a useful life so it's
 

00:09:13.579 --> 00:09:16.449
power plant has a useful life so it's
going to provide me with electricity /

00:09:16.449 --> 00:09:16.459
going to provide me with electricity /
 

00:09:16.459 --> 00:09:19.689
going to provide me with electricity /
its useful life and the value of that

00:09:19.689 --> 00:09:19.699
its useful life and the value of that
 

00:09:19.699 --> 00:09:22.840
its useful life and the value of that
electricity is going to depend on the

00:09:22.840 --> 00:09:22.850
electricity is going to depend on the
 

00:09:22.850 --> 00:09:26.679
electricity is going to depend on the
interest rate as well as other factors

00:09:26.679 --> 00:09:26.689
interest rate as well as other factors
 

00:09:26.689 --> 00:09:28.210
interest rate as well as other factors
which I've simplified out of this

00:09:28.210 --> 00:09:28.220
which I've simplified out of this
 

00:09:28.220 --> 00:09:34.480
which I've simplified out of this
analysis variable cost on the other hand

00:09:34.480 --> 00:09:34.490
analysis variable cost on the other hand
 

00:09:34.490 --> 00:09:39.370
analysis variable cost on the other hand
is the cost that I spend to generate one

00:09:39.370 --> 00:09:39.380
is the cost that I spend to generate one
 

00:09:39.380 --> 00:09:42.550
is the cost that I spend to generate one
kilowatt-hour of electricity at a point

00:09:42.550 --> 00:09:42.560
kilowatt-hour of electricity at a point
 

00:09:42.560 --> 00:09:47.530
kilowatt-hour of electricity at a point
in time so variable cost is usually

00:09:47.530 --> 00:09:47.540
in time so variable cost is usually
 

00:09:47.540 --> 00:09:50.379
in time so variable cost is usually
expressed in dollars per kilowatt hour

00:09:50.379 --> 00:09:50.389
expressed in dollars per kilowatt hour
 

00:09:50.389 --> 00:09:58.679
expressed in dollars per kilowatt hour
or dollars per kilowatt year okay so

00:09:58.679 --> 00:09:58.689
or dollars per kilowatt year okay so
 

00:09:58.689 --> 00:10:04.809
or dollars per kilowatt year okay so
dollars per kilowatt generated in a unit

00:10:04.809 --> 00:10:04.819
dollars per kilowatt generated in a unit
 

00:10:04.819 --> 00:10:08.410
dollars per kilowatt generated in a unit
of time okay so I've got to convert my

00:10:08.410 --> 00:10:08.420
of time okay so I've got to convert my
 

00:10:08.420 --> 00:10:12.939
of time okay so I've got to convert my
overnight cost which is just dollars per

00:10:12.939 --> 00:10:12.949
overnight cost which is just dollars per
 

00:10:12.949 --> 00:10:17.499
overnight cost which is just dollars per
kilowatt into the same units as variable

00:10:17.499 --> 00:10:17.509
kilowatt into the same units as variable
 

00:10:17.509 --> 00:10:22.150
kilowatt into the same units as variable
costs okay so the way to do that just

00:10:22.150 --> 00:10:22.160
costs okay so the way to do that just
 

00:10:22.160 --> 00:10:24.280
costs okay so the way to do that just
think about it conceptually overnight

00:10:24.280 --> 00:10:24.290
think about it conceptually overnight
 

00:10:24.290 --> 00:10:29.079
think about it conceptually overnight
cost is like paying an upfront purchase

00:10:29.079 --> 00:10:29.089
cost is like paying an upfront purchase
 

00:10:29.089 --> 00:10:34.519
cost is like paying an upfront purchase
price for your home and variable costs

00:10:34.519 --> 00:10:34.529
price for your home and variable costs
 

00:10:34.529 --> 00:10:41.239
price for your home and variable costs
is like the rent that you save by owning

00:10:41.239 --> 00:10:41.249
is like the rent that you save by owning
 

00:10:41.249 --> 00:10:46.160
is like the rent that you save by owning
your home ok so the overnight cost is a

00:10:46.160 --> 00:10:46.170
your home ok so the overnight cost is a
 

00:10:46.170 --> 00:10:51.910
your home ok so the overnight cost is a
stock and the variable cost is a flow

00:10:51.910 --> 00:10:51.920
stock and the variable cost is a flow
 

00:10:51.920 --> 00:10:54.350
stock and the variable cost is a flow
okay so this is a distinction you want

00:10:54.350 --> 00:10:54.360
okay so this is a distinction you want
 

00:10:54.360 --> 00:11:00.110
okay so this is a distinction you want
to keep in mind yes yeah so so in order

00:11:00.110 --> 00:11:00.120
to keep in mind yes yeah so so in order
 

00:11:00.120 --> 00:11:02.449
to keep in mind yes yeah so so in order
to do that translation I've given you a

00:11:02.449 --> 00:11:02.459
to do that translation I've given you a
 

00:11:02.459 --> 00:11:06.319
to do that translation I've given you a
formula here and so I want to just talk

00:11:06.319 --> 00:11:06.329
formula here and so I want to just talk
 

00:11:06.329 --> 00:11:09.429
formula here and so I want to just talk
a little bit about this formula okay

00:11:09.429 --> 00:11:09.439
a little bit about this formula okay
 

00:11:09.439 --> 00:11:14.179
a little bit about this formula okay
that's fixed cost expressed in dollars

00:11:14.179 --> 00:11:14.189
that's fixed cost expressed in dollars
 

00:11:14.189 --> 00:11:19.480
that's fixed cost expressed in dollars
per kilowatt year and how do I get that

00:11:19.480 --> 00:11:19.490
 

00:11:19.490 --> 00:11:26.090
in the numerator I have and a rate of

00:11:26.090 --> 00:11:26.100
in the numerator I have and a rate of
 

00:11:26.100 --> 00:11:30.829
in the numerator I have and a rate of
return that I could have earned on my

00:11:30.829 --> 00:11:30.839
return that I could have earned on my
 

00:11:30.839 --> 00:11:33.019
return that I could have earned on my
investment remember the overnight cost

00:11:33.019 --> 00:11:33.029
investment remember the overnight cost
 

00:11:33.029 --> 00:11:35.540
investment remember the overnight cost
is like my investment the purchase price

00:11:35.540 --> 00:11:35.550
is like my investment the purchase price
 

00:11:35.550 --> 00:11:38.389
is like my investment the purchase price
for my home the interest rate or the

00:11:38.389 --> 00:11:38.399
for my home the interest rate or the
 

00:11:38.399 --> 00:11:43.990
for my home the interest rate or the
discount rate times that overnight cost

00:11:43.990 --> 00:11:44.000
discount rate times that overnight cost
 

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:53.769
discount rate times that overnight cost
gives me an approximate annual flow of

00:11:53.769 --> 00:11:53.779
 

00:11:53.779 --> 00:11:56.869
benefits that I received from that

00:11:56.869 --> 00:11:56.879
benefits that I received from that
 

00:11:56.879 --> 00:12:00.199
benefits that I received from that
investment ok so if instead of buying my

00:12:00.199 --> 00:12:00.209
investment ok so if instead of buying my
 

00:12:00.209 --> 00:12:02.420
investment ok so if instead of buying my
house I had put it in the in the stock

00:12:02.420 --> 00:12:02.430
house I had put it in the in the stock
 

00:12:02.430 --> 00:12:04.970
house I had put it in the in the stock
market maybe not that's a bad example if

00:12:04.970 --> 00:12:04.980

00:12:04.980 --> 00:12:07.100
market maybe not that's a bad example if
I had put it in Treasury bonds or

00:12:07.100 --> 00:12:07.110
I had put it in Treasury bonds or
 

00:12:07.110 --> 00:12:11.299
I had put it in Treasury bonds or
something then I would have earned some

00:12:11.299 --> 00:12:11.309
something then I would have earned some
 

00:12:11.309 --> 00:12:14.840
something then I would have earned some
return and that this quantity is going

but will be related orders of magnitude

00:12:23.569 --> 00:12:23.579
but will be related orders of magnitude
 

00:12:23.579 --> 00:12:30.519
but will be related orders of magnitude
to that annual benefit okay

00:12:30.519 --> 00:12:30.529
 

00:12:30.529 --> 00:12:32.989
that's yes that's like my annual

out that what you would discount it by
 

00:14:21.770 --> 00:14:27.190
out that what you would discount it by
is 1 plus R okay so if the interest rate

00:14:27.190 --> 00:14:27.200
is 1 plus R okay so if the interest rate
 

00:14:27.200 --> 00:14:31.300
is 1 plus R okay so if the interest rate
is ten percent you divide this by 1.1 to

00:14:31.300 --> 00:14:31.310
is ten percent you divide this by 1.1 to
 

00:14:31.310 --> 00:14:33.820
is ten percent you divide this by 1.1 to
get its value today of course if you've

00:14:43.840 --> 00:14:43.850
year you would do that divided by 1 plus
 

00:14:43.850 --> 00:14:55.300
year you would do that divided by 1 plus
R squared and so on okay and you'd have

00:14:55.300 --> 00:14:55.310
R squared and so on okay and you'd have
 

00:14:55.310 --> 00:15:02.770

things you might have an infinite number

00:15:12.490 --> 00:15:12.500
things you might have an infinite number
 

00:15:12.500 --> 00:15:17.380
things you might have an infinite number
of terms okay but it turns out and I'll

00:15:17.380 --> 00:15:17.390
of terms okay but it turns out and I'll
 

00:15:17.390 --> 00:15:20.080
of terms okay but it turns out and I'll
show you this in some other class it

00:15:20.080 --> 00:15:20.090
show you this in some other class it
 

00:15:20.090 --> 00:15:24.960
show you this in some other class it
turns out that this ends up being

00:15:24.960 --> 00:15:24.970
turns out that this ends up being
 

00:15:24.970 --> 00:15:27.730
turns out that this ends up being
approximately equal to that that is this

00:15:27.730 --> 00:15:27.740
approximately equal to that that is this
 

00:15:27.740 --> 00:15:32.530
approximately equal to that that is this
wholesome ends up being approximately

00:15:32.530 --> 00:15:32.540
wholesome ends up being approximately
 

00:15:32.540 --> 00:15:36.100
wholesome ends up being approximately
equal to that okay this is and if you

00:15:36.100 --> 00:15:36.110
equal to that okay this is and if you
 

00:15:36.110 --> 00:15:43.090
equal to that okay this is and if you
remember a summing infinite series in

00:15:43.090 --> 00:15:43.100
remember a summing infinite series in
 

00:15:43.100 --> 00:15:47.950
remember a summing infinite series in
college or in high school then you'll

00:15:47.950 --> 00:15:47.960
college or in high school then you'll
 

00:15:47.960 --> 00:15:50.680
college or in high school then you'll
you'll recall that the shape of this

00:15:50.680 --> 00:15:50.690
you'll recall that the shape of this
 

00:15:50.690 --> 00:15:53.530
you'll recall that the shape of this
formula anywhere right okay don't worry

00:15:53.530 --> 00:15:53.540
formula anywhere right okay don't worry
 

00:15:53.540 --> 00:15:59.530
formula anywhere right okay don't worry
if that was meaningless okay just that

00:15:59.530 --> 00:15:59.540
if that was meaningless okay just that
 

00:15:59.540 --> 00:16:03.210
if that was meaningless okay just that
last part not the whole two hours

00:16:03.210 --> 00:16:03.220
 

00:16:03.220 --> 00:16:10.330
okay okay so so so okay so all i did was

00:16:10.330 --> 00:16:10.340
okay okay so so so okay so all i did was
 

00:16:10.340 --> 00:16:17.470
okay okay so so so okay so all i did was
i I summed these values to get me the

00:16:17.470 --> 00:16:17.480
i I summed these values to get me the
 

00:16:17.480 --> 00:16:22.380
i I summed these values to get me the
fixed cost but converted into annual

00:16:22.380 --> 00:16:22.390
fixed cost but converted into annual
 

00:16:22.390 --> 00:16:30.100
fixed cost but converted into annual
units okay so when i do that so for the

00:16:30.100 --> 00:16:30.110
units okay so when i do that so for the
 

00:16:30.110 --> 00:16:35.910
units okay so when i do that so for the
coal plant I can take 1050 so i put in

00:16:35.910 --> 00:16:35.920
coal plant I can take 1050 so i put in
 

00:16:35.920 --> 00:16:44.700
coal plant I can take 1050 so i put in
1050 here and i do an example here where

00:16:44.700 --> 00:16:44.710
 

00:16:44.710 --> 00:16:47.910
the interest rate is ten percent

00:16:47.910 --> 00:16:47.920
the interest rate is ten percent
 

00:16:47.920 --> 00:16:51.010
the interest rate is ten percent
generally in these formulas the interest

00:16:51.010 --> 00:16:51.020
generally in these formulas the interest
 

00:16:51.020 --> 00:16:54.040
generally in these formulas the interest
rate is always entered as a decimal

00:16:54.040 --> 00:16:54.050
rate is always entered as a decimal
 

00:16:54.050 --> 00:16:57.790
rate is always entered as a decimal
between zero and one so ten percent will

00:16:57.790 --> 00:16:57.800
between zero and one so ten percent will
 

00:16:57.800 --> 00:17:00.670
between zero and one so ten percent will
be point one okay if you put in the

00:17:00.670 --> 00:17:00.680
be point one okay if you put in the
 

00:17:00.680 --> 00:17:04.300
be point one okay if you put in the
number ten you'll get results that don't

00:17:04.300 --> 00:17:04.310
number ten you'll get results that don't
 

00:17:04.310 --> 00:17:06.100
number ten you'll get results that don't
make sense so that's that's a good way

00:17:06.100 --> 00:17:06.110
make sense so that's that's a good way
 

00:17:06.110 --> 00:17:08.350
make sense so that's that's a good way
to remember whether you did it right or

00:17:08.350 --> 00:17:08.360
to remember whether you did it right or
 

00:17:08.360 --> 00:17:11.920
to remember whether you did it right or
not and t here is 40 for the coal plant

00:17:11.920 --> 00:17:11.930
not and t here is 40 for the coal plant
 

00:17:11.930 --> 00:17:15.940
not and t here is 40 for the coal plant
and 20 this is in years for the gas okay

00:17:15.940 --> 00:17:15.950
and 20 this is in years for the gas okay
 

00:17:15.950 --> 00:17:20.290
and 20 this is in years for the gas okay
so when you plug T equals 40 and r

00:17:20.290 --> 00:17:20.300
so when you plug T equals 40 and r
 

00:17:20.300 --> 00:17:25.030
so when you plug T equals 40 and r
equals point 1 and the 1050 into this

00:17:25.030 --> 00:17:25.040
equals point 1 and the 1050 into this
 

00:17:25.040 --> 00:17:30.220
equals point 1 and the 1050 into this
formula then you get the fixed costs for

00:17:30.220 --> 00:17:30.230
formula then you get the fixed costs for
 

00:17:30.230 --> 00:17:34.030
formula then you get the fixed costs for
the coal plant as a hundred and seven

00:17:34.030 --> 00:17:34.040
the coal plant as a hundred and seven
 

00:17:34.040 --> 00:17:39.130
the coal plant as a hundred and seven
dollars per kilowatt year okay so that

00:17:39.130 --> 00:17:39.140
dollars per kilowatt year okay so that
 

00:17:39.140 --> 00:17:47.190
dollars per kilowatt year okay so that
means that to produce one kilowatt

00:17:47.190 --> 00:17:47.200
 

00:17:47.200 --> 00:17:50.020
consistently over the course of the year

00:17:50.020 --> 00:17:50.030
consistently over the course of the year
 

00:17:50.030 --> 00:17:56.700
consistently over the course of the year
so to produce one kilowatt every minute

00:17:56.700 --> 00:17:56.710
so to produce one kilowatt every minute
 

00:17:56.710 --> 00:17:59.890
so to produce one kilowatt every minute
for however many minutes there are in

00:17:59.890 --> 00:17:59.900
for however many minutes there are in
 

00:17:59.900 --> 00:18:04.060
for however many minutes there are in
the year you would need to spend in

00:18:04.060 --> 00:18:04.070
the year you would need to spend in
 

00:18:04.070 --> 00:18:07.180
the year you would need to spend in
fixed costs a hundred and seven dollars

00:18:07.180 --> 00:18:07.190
fixed costs a hundred and seven dollars
 

00:18:07.190 --> 00:18:11.680
fixed costs a hundred and seven dollars
and in effect you need to spend a

00:18:11.680 --> 00:18:11.690
and in effect you need to spend a
 

00:18:11.690 --> 00:18:15.180
and in effect you need to spend a
hundred and seven dollars on average

00:18:15.180 --> 00:18:15.190
hundred and seven dollars on average
 

00:18:15.190 --> 00:18:18.630
hundred and seven dollars on average
every year in present value terms for 40

00:18:18.630 --> 00:18:18.640
every year in present value terms for 40
 

00:18:18.640 --> 00:18:22.890
every year in present value terms for 40
years so what that does is it translates

00:18:22.890 --> 00:18:22.900
years so what that does is it translates
 

00:18:22.900 --> 00:18:27.420
years so what that does is it translates
your initial investment of 1,050 into a

00:18:27.420 --> 00:18:27.430
your initial investment of 1,050 into a
 

00:18:27.430 --> 00:18:31.260
your initial investment of 1,050 into a
levelized fixed cost a manual level eyes

00:18:31.260 --> 00:18:31.270
levelized fixed cost a manual level eyes
 

00:18:31.270 --> 00:18:35.760
levelized fixed cost a manual level eyes
fixed cost if you read analyses of wind

00:18:35.760 --> 00:18:35.770
fixed cost if you read analyses of wind
 

00:18:35.770 --> 00:18:38.790
fixed cost if you read analyses of wind
power versus nuclear power you'll see

00:18:38.790 --> 00:18:38.800
power versus nuclear power you'll see
 

00:18:38.800 --> 00:18:41.460
power versus nuclear power you'll see
the term levelized costs come up often

00:18:41.460 --> 00:18:41.470
the term levelized costs come up often
 

00:18:41.470 --> 00:18:44.870
the term levelized costs come up often
okay so this is what levelized cost is

00:18:44.870 --> 00:18:44.880
okay so this is what levelized cost is
 

00:18:44.880 --> 00:18:49.620
okay so this is what levelized cost is
taking an expenditure that occurs in a

00:18:49.620 --> 00:18:49.630
taking an expenditure that occurs in a
 

00:18:49.630 --> 00:18:51.720
taking an expenditure that occurs in a
short period of time like the purchase

00:18:51.720 --> 00:18:51.730
short period of time like the purchase
 

00:18:51.730 --> 00:18:55.230
short period of time like the purchase
price or the investment costs and you

00:18:55.230 --> 00:18:55.240
price or the investment costs and you
 

00:18:55.240 --> 00:18:58.950
price or the investment costs and you
know that its benefits will be received

00:18:58.950 --> 00:18:58.960
know that its benefits will be received
 

00:18:58.960 --> 00:19:00.960
know that its benefits will be received
over a long period of time but it will

00:19:00.960 --> 00:19:00.970
over a long period of time but it will
 

00:19:00.970 --> 00:19:03.690
over a long period of time but it will
not be received in equal amounts every

00:19:03.690 --> 00:19:03.700
not be received in equal amounts every
 

00:19:03.700 --> 00:19:09.240
not be received in equal amounts every
year you level eyes it to say what the

00:19:09.240 --> 00:19:09.250
year you level eyes it to say what the
 

00:19:09.250 --> 00:19:11.730
year you level eyes it to say what the
average level would be if you were to

00:19:11.730 --> 00:19:11.740
average level would be if you were to
 

00:19:11.740 --> 00:19:14.270
average level would be if you were to
receive the benefits equally every year

00:19:14.270 --> 00:19:14.280
receive the benefits equally every year
 

00:19:14.280 --> 00:19:18.210
receive the benefits equally every year
okay so that's the levelized cost fixed

00:19:18.210 --> 00:19:18.220
okay so that's the levelized cost fixed
 

00:19:18.220 --> 00:19:20.430
okay so that's the levelized cost fixed
costs for the coal plant and that's that

00:19:20.430 --> 00:19:20.440
costs for the coal plant and that's that
 

00:19:20.440 --> 00:19:24.480
costs for the coal plant and that's that
for the gas turbine okay now suppose I

00:19:24.480 --> 00:19:24.490
for the gas turbine okay now suppose I
 

00:19:24.490 --> 00:19:27.300
for the gas turbine okay now suppose I
give you the variable costs and these

00:19:27.300 --> 00:19:27.310
give you the variable costs and these
 

00:19:27.310 --> 00:19:30.660
give you the variable costs and these
are these are numbers from some eia

00:19:30.660 --> 00:19:30.670
are these are numbers from some eia
 

00:19:30.670 --> 00:19:40.170
are these are numbers from some eia
report and that is that's eighty-seven

00:19:40.170 --> 00:19:40.180
report and that is that's eighty-seven
 

00:19:40.180 --> 00:19:43.620
report and that is that's eighty-seven
dollars per kilowatt year okay that's

00:19:43.620 --> 00:19:43.630
dollars per kilowatt year okay that's
 

00:19:43.630 --> 00:19:45.900
dollars per kilowatt year okay that's
that's about ten dollars per kilowatt

00:19:45.900 --> 00:19:45.910
that's about ten dollars per kilowatt
 

00:19:45.910 --> 00:19:49.920
that's about ten dollars per kilowatt
hour okay there are eight thousand seven

00:19:49.920 --> 00:19:49.930
hour okay there are eight thousand seven
 

00:19:49.930 --> 00:19:55.130
hour okay there are eight thousand seven
hundred and sixty hours in the year okay

00:19:55.130 --> 00:19:55.140
hundred and sixty hours in the year okay
 

00:19:55.140 --> 00:19:58.680
hundred and sixty hours in the year okay
you can see that the gas turbine has a

00:19:58.680 --> 00:19:58.690
you can see that the gas turbine has a
 

00:19:58.690 --> 00:20:01.890
you can see that the gas turbine has a
much higher variable cost than the coal

00:20:01.890 --> 00:20:01.900
much higher variable cost than the coal
 

00:20:01.900 --> 00:20:05.220
much higher variable cost than the coal
plant okay not excluding the cost of

00:20:05.220 --> 00:20:05.230
plant okay not excluding the cost of
 

00:20:05.230 --> 00:20:07.740
plant okay not excluding the cost of
permits not including the cost of the

00:20:07.740 --> 00:20:07.750
permits not including the cost of the
 

00:20:07.750 --> 00:20:21.760
permits not including the cost of the
permits ok so now yes

00:20:21.760 --> 00:20:21.770
 

00:20:21.770 --> 00:20:24.980
yes yes of course yes sorry I skipped a

00:20:24.980 --> 00:20:24.990
yes yes of course yes sorry I skipped a
 

00:20:24.990 --> 00:20:33.430
yes yes of course yes sorry I skipped a
step

00:20:33.430 --> 00:20:33.440
 

00:20:33.440 --> 00:20:41.700
okay so that's the equation right FC

00:20:41.700 --> 00:20:41.710
okay so that's the equation right FC
 

00:20:41.710 --> 00:20:47.710
okay so that's the equation right FC
equal to our OC over 1 minus e to the

00:20:47.710 --> 00:20:47.720
equal to our OC over 1 minus e to the
 

00:20:47.720 --> 00:20:52.330
equal to our OC over 1 minus e to the
minus RT okay so for the coal plant for

00:20:52.330 --> 00:20:52.340
minus RT okay so for the coal plant for
 

00:20:52.340 --> 00:20:57.909
minus RT okay so for the coal plant for
the coal plant t is equal to 40 and r is

00:20:57.909 --> 00:20:57.919
the coal plant t is equal to 40 and r is
 

00:20:57.919 --> 00:21:06.639
the coal plant t is equal to 40 and r is
equal to 0 point 1 so FC for the coal

00:21:06.639 --> 00:21:06.649
equal to 0 point 1 so FC for the coal
 

00:21:06.649 --> 00:21:13.810
equal to 0 point 1 so FC for the coal
plant is 0 point 1 times the overnight

00:21:13.810 --> 00:21:13.820
plant is 0 point 1 times the overnight
 

00:21:13.820 --> 00:21:28.799
plant is 0 point 1 times the overnight
cost which was 1050 over 1 minus e

00:21:28.799 --> 00:21:28.809
 

00:21:28.809 --> 00:21:32.950
remember e is a constant approximately

00:21:32.950 --> 00:21:32.960
remember e is a constant approximately
 

00:21:32.960 --> 00:21:37.360
remember e is a constant approximately
equal to two point seven one raised to

00:21:37.360 --> 00:21:37.370
equal to two point seven one raised to
 

00:21:37.370 --> 00:21:41.320
equal to two point seven one raised to
the power minus RT so that's going to be

00:21:41.320 --> 00:21:41.330
the power minus RT so that's going to be
 

00:21:41.330 --> 00:21:50.700
the power minus RT so that's going to be
point 1 x 40 okay so you will need

00:21:50.700 --> 00:21:50.710
point 1 x 40 okay so you will need
 

00:21:50.710 --> 00:21:55.419
point 1 x 40 okay so you will need
you'll need a calculator that has e in

00:21:55.419 --> 00:21:55.429
you'll need a calculator that has e in
 

00:21:55.429 --> 00:22:00.310
you'll need a calculator that has e in
it and when you calculate this out you

00:22:00.310 --> 00:22:00.320
it and when you calculate this out you
 

00:22:00.320 --> 00:22:11.820
it and when you calculate this out you
should get 10 696 okay

00:22:11.820 --> 00:22:11.830
 

00:22:11.830 --> 00:22:19.490
or you can do it in Excel okay okay and

00:22:19.490 --> 00:22:19.500
or you can do it in Excel okay okay and
 

00:22:19.500 --> 00:22:23.909
or you can do it in Excel okay okay and
this i just gave you okay this was not

00:22:23.909 --> 00:22:23.919
this i just gave you okay this was not
 

00:22:23.919 --> 00:22:30.690
this i just gave you okay this was not
computed okay now but what's but why why

00:22:30.690 --> 00:22:30.700
computed okay now but what's but why why
 

00:22:30.700 --> 00:22:35.820
computed okay now but what's but why why
why is this so now that you've gotten to

00:22:35.820 --> 00:22:35.830
why is this so now that you've gotten to
 

00:22:35.830 --> 00:22:40.620
why is this so now that you've gotten to
this stage you can do some simultaneous

00:22:40.620 --> 00:22:40.630
this stage you can do some simultaneous
 

00:22:40.630 --> 00:22:43.009
this stage you can do some simultaneous
equations okay linear simultaneous

00:22:43.009 --> 00:22:43.019
equations okay linear simultaneous
 

00:22:43.019 --> 00:22:51.750
equations okay linear simultaneous
equations because I had said that I had

00:22:51.750 --> 00:22:51.760
equations because I had said that I had
 

00:22:51.760 --> 00:22:56.180
equations because I had said that I had
said that the choice of generating

00:22:56.180 --> 00:22:56.190
said that the choice of generating
 

00:22:56.190 --> 00:22:59.909
said that the choice of generating
technology depends on how much how

00:22:59.909 --> 00:22:59.919
technology depends on how much how
 

00:22:59.919 --> 00:23:01.980
technology depends on how much how
frequently you expect to use the

00:23:01.980 --> 00:23:01.990
frequently you expect to use the
 

00:23:01.990 --> 00:23:04.860
frequently you expect to use the
technology right and our intuition was

00:23:04.860 --> 00:23:04.870
technology right and our intuition was
 

00:23:04.870 --> 00:23:07.710
technology right and our intuition was
that if I'm going to run the plant one

00:23:07.710 --> 00:23:07.720
that if I'm going to run the plant one
 

00:23:07.720 --> 00:23:09.600
that if I'm going to run the plant one
hundred percent of the time chances are

00:23:09.600 --> 00:23:09.610
hundred percent of the time chances are
 

00:23:09.610 --> 00:23:12.659
hundred percent of the time chances are
i'm going to pick the coal plant with

00:23:12.659 --> 00:23:12.669
i'm going to pick the coal plant with
 

00:23:12.669 --> 00:23:17.669
i'm going to pick the coal plant with
the lower variable cost right so you

00:23:17.669 --> 00:23:17.679
the lower variable cost right so you
 

00:23:17.679 --> 00:23:22.470
the lower variable cost right so you
want to know in answering which plant to

00:23:22.470 --> 00:23:22.480
want to know in answering which plant to
 

00:23:22.480 --> 00:23:25.080
want to know in answering which plant to
choose your answer surely has to depend

00:23:25.080 --> 00:23:25.090
choose your answer surely has to depend
 

00:23:25.090 --> 00:23:27.840
choose your answer surely has to depend
on how frequently you're going to use it

00:23:27.840 --> 00:23:27.850
on how frequently you're going to use it
 

00:23:27.850 --> 00:23:34.500
on how frequently you're going to use it
right so all of this all of this is in

00:23:34.500 --> 00:23:34.510
right so all of this all of this is in
 

00:23:34.510 --> 00:23:39.389
right so all of this all of this is in
terms of kilowatts per year okay so i

00:23:39.389 --> 00:23:39.399
terms of kilowatts per year okay so i
 

00:23:39.399 --> 00:23:43.019
terms of kilowatts per year okay so i
can define a variable which is commonly

00:23:43.019 --> 00:23:43.029
can define a variable which is commonly
 

00:23:43.029 --> 00:23:46.620
can define a variable which is commonly
used in electricity economics called the

00:23:46.620 --> 00:23:46.630
used in electricity economics called the
 

00:23:46.630 --> 00:23:50.730
used in electricity economics called the
capacity factor which is the percentage

00:23:50.730 --> 00:23:50.740
capacity factor which is the percentage
 

00:23:50.740 --> 00:23:52.889
capacity factor which is the percentage
of time that the plant is going to be up

00:23:52.889 --> 00:23:52.899
of time that the plant is going to be up
 

00:23:52.899 --> 00:23:57.210
of time that the plant is going to be up
and running and generally plants are not

00:23:57.210 --> 00:23:57.220
and running and generally plants are not
 

00:23:57.220 --> 00:23:58.980
and running and generally plants are not
up and running hundred percent of the

00:23:58.980 --> 00:23:58.990
up and running hundred percent of the
 

00:23:58.990 --> 00:24:01.100
up and running hundred percent of the
time they have maintenance schedules

00:24:01.100 --> 00:24:01.110
time they have maintenance schedules
 

00:24:01.110 --> 00:24:05.629
time they have maintenance schedules
they may be producing sorry electricity

00:24:05.629 --> 00:24:05.639
they may be producing sorry electricity
 

00:24:05.639 --> 00:24:10.740
they may be producing sorry electricity
at a time they they they may be shut

00:24:10.740 --> 00:24:10.750
at a time they they they may be shut
 

00:24:10.750 --> 00:24:12.350
at a time they they they may be shut
down when

00:24:12.350 --> 00:24:12.360
down when
 

00:24:12.360 --> 00:24:15.680
down when
actually in the middle of night winter

00:24:15.680 --> 00:24:15.690
actually in the middle of night winter
 

00:24:15.690 --> 00:24:20.780
actually in the middle of night winter
and still not quite so and it turns out

00:24:20.780 --> 00:24:20.790
and still not quite so and it turns out
 

00:24:20.790 --> 00:24:24.410
and still not quite so and it turns out
the coal plants entered one around

00:24:24.410 --> 00:24:24.420
the coal plants entered one around
 

00:24:24.420 --> 00:24:27.650
the coal plants entered one around
seventy-five percent of the time and gas

00:24:27.650 --> 00:24:27.660
seventy-five percent of the time and gas
 

00:24:27.660 --> 00:24:30.160
seventy-five percent of the time and gas
turbines can run around twenty percent

00:24:30.160 --> 00:24:30.170
turbines can run around twenty percent
 

00:24:30.170 --> 00:24:33.680
turbines can run around twenty percent
and you'll see there's a reason for that

00:24:33.680 --> 00:24:33.690
and you'll see there's a reason for that
 

00:24:33.690 --> 00:24:37.160
and you'll see there's a reason for that
is of course related to the variable and

00:24:37.160 --> 00:24:37.170
is of course related to the variable and
 

00:24:37.170 --> 00:24:39.860
is of course related to the variable and
fixed costs okay so what we're going to

00:24:39.860 --> 00:24:39.870
fixed costs okay so what we're going to
 

00:24:39.870 --> 00:24:44.030
fixed costs okay so what we're going to
do is ok so if there if so let's go

00:24:44.030 --> 00:24:44.040
do is ok so if there if so let's go
 

00:24:44.040 --> 00:24:46.370
do is ok so if there if so let's go
through this intuition here for a second

00:24:46.370 --> 00:24:46.380
through this intuition here for a second
 

00:24:46.380 --> 00:24:48.500
through this intuition here for a second
if the power line is run on the Senate

00:24:48.500 --> 00:24:48.510
if the power line is run on the Senate
 

00:24:48.510 --> 00:24:53.360
if the power line is run on the Senate
of time then how much revenue do you

00:24:53.360 --> 00:24:53.370
of time then how much revenue do you
 

00:24:53.370 --> 00:24:56.750
of time then how much revenue do you
need to break even or what will be your

00:24:56.750 --> 00:24:56.760
need to break even or what will be your
 

00:24:56.760 --> 00:24:59.570
need to break even or what will be your
total cost of operation it's going to be

00:24:59.570 --> 00:24:59.580
total cost of operation it's going to be
 

00:24:59.580 --> 00:25:04.120
total cost of operation it's going to be
your fixed cost plus your variable cost

00:25:04.120 --> 00:25:04.130
your fixed cost plus your variable cost
 

00:25:04.130 --> 00:25:10.730
your fixed cost plus your variable cost
because this is your fixed cost for all

00:25:10.730 --> 00:25:10.740
because this is your fixed cost for all
 

00:25:10.740 --> 00:25:13.549
because this is your fixed cost for all
kilowatts produced in the year so

00:25:13.549 --> 00:25:13.559
kilowatts produced in the year so
 

00:25:13.559 --> 00:25:15.980
kilowatts produced in the year so
variable cost for all kilowatts produced

00:25:15.980 --> 00:25:15.990
variable cost for all kilowatts produced
 

00:25:15.990 --> 00:25:21.230
variable cost for all kilowatts produced
in the year for 8760 hours so if you

00:25:21.230 --> 00:25:21.240
in the year for 8760 hours so if you
 

00:25:21.240 --> 00:25:22.580
in the year for 8760 hours so if you
were running a hundred percent of the

00:25:22.580 --> 00:25:22.590
were running a hundred percent of the
 

00:25:22.590 --> 00:25:25.039
were running a hundred percent of the
time you could simply take for the coal

00:25:25.039 --> 00:25:25.049
time you could simply take for the coal
 

00:25:25.049 --> 00:25:30.169
time you could simply take for the coal
plant 106 96 plus 8760 and you'd get a

00:25:30.169 --> 00:25:30.179
plant 106 96 plus 8760 and you'd get a
 

00:25:30.179 --> 00:25:34.549
plant 106 96 plus 8760 and you'd get a
number something like 195 per kilowatt

00:25:34.549 --> 00:25:34.559
number something like 195 per kilowatt
 

00:25:34.559 --> 00:25:39.140
number something like 195 per kilowatt
and that's how much your total cost

00:25:39.140 --> 00:25:39.150
and that's how much your total cost
 

00:25:39.150 --> 00:25:43.400
and that's how much your total cost
would be and you take 40 plus 306 if

00:25:43.400 --> 00:25:43.410
would be and you take 40 plus 306 if
 

00:25:43.410 --> 00:25:44.780
would be and you take 40 plus 306 if
you're running the gas turbine all the

00:25:44.780 --> 00:25:44.790
you're running the gas turbine all the
 

00:25:44.790 --> 00:25:48.409
you're running the gas turbine all the
time and you get a number like 346 and

00:25:48.409 --> 00:25:48.419
time and you get a number like 346 and
 

00:25:48.419 --> 00:25:50.419
time and you get a number like 346 and
that be your total cost of operation in

00:25:50.419 --> 00:25:50.429
that be your total cost of operation in
 

00:25:50.429 --> 00:25:53.690
that be your total cost of operation in
the gas plant right so obviously if you

00:25:53.690 --> 00:25:53.700
the gas plant right so obviously if you
 

00:25:53.700 --> 00:25:55.130
the gas plant right so obviously if you
were running at one hundred percent at a

00:25:55.130 --> 00:25:55.140
were running at one hundred percent at a
 

00:25:55.140 --> 00:26:00.590
were running at one hundred percent at a
time 190 is less than 346 so you'd go

00:26:00.590 --> 00:26:00.600
time 190 is less than 346 so you'd go
 

00:26:00.600 --> 00:26:05.990
time 190 is less than 346 so you'd go
with the coal plant but generating

00:26:05.990 --> 00:26:06.000
with the coal plant but generating
 

00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:09.380
with the coal plant but generating
plants are designed for various type

00:26:09.380 --> 00:26:09.390
plants are designed for various type
 

00:26:09.390 --> 00:26:13.460
plants are designed for various type
various demand profiles for example a

00:26:13.460 --> 00:26:13.470
various demand profiles for example a
 

00:26:13.470 --> 00:26:15.799
various demand profiles for example a
gas plant is much faster to turn on and

00:26:15.799 --> 00:26:15.809
gas plant is much faster to turn on and
 

00:26:15.809 --> 00:26:18.190
gas plant is much faster to turn on and
turn off right so you use a gas plant

00:26:18.190 --> 00:26:18.200
turn off right so you use a gas plant
 

00:26:18.200 --> 00:26:21.080
turn off right so you use a gas plant
part of the time you use it generally to

00:26:21.080 --> 00:26:21.090
part of the time you use it generally to
 

00:26:21.090 --> 00:26:23.210
part of the time you use it generally to
satisfy peak demand

00:26:23.210 --> 00:26:23.220
satisfy peak demand
 

00:26:23.220 --> 00:26:28.899
satisfy peak demand
between 1pm and 7pm in the summertime

00:26:28.899 --> 00:26:28.909
between 1pm and 7pm in the summertime
 

00:26:28.909 --> 00:26:30.970
between 1pm and 7pm in the summertime
when everybody runs their

00:26:30.970 --> 00:26:30.980
when everybody runs their
 

00:26:30.980 --> 00:26:34.820
when everybody runs their
air-conditioned okay so that's why gas

00:26:34.820 --> 00:26:34.830
air-conditioned okay so that's why gas
 

00:26:34.830 --> 00:26:36.850
air-conditioned okay so that's why gas
plants run twenty percent of the time

00:26:36.850 --> 00:26:36.860
plants run twenty percent of the time
 

00:26:36.860 --> 00:26:42.260
plants run twenty percent of the time
but so so we we want to know which is

00:26:42.260 --> 00:26:42.270
but so so we we want to know which is
 

00:26:42.270 --> 00:26:44.899
but so so we we want to know which is
the cheaper technology for a particular

00:26:44.899 --> 00:26:44.909
the cheaper technology for a particular
 

00:26:44.909 --> 00:26:49.330
the cheaper technology for a particular
given capacity factor so let's define

00:26:49.330 --> 00:26:49.340
given capacity factor so let's define
 

00:26:49.340 --> 00:26:55.190
given capacity factor so let's define
the variable CF as the capacity factor

00:26:55.190 --> 00:26:55.200
the variable CF as the capacity factor
 

00:26:55.200 --> 00:26:57.110
the variable CF as the capacity factor
and we define it as the proportion of

00:26:57.110 --> 00:26:57.120
and we define it as the proportion of
 

00:26:57.120 --> 00:26:59.870
and we define it as the proportion of
time the plant has run so it's going to

00:26:59.870 --> 00:26:59.880
time the plant has run so it's going to
 

00:26:59.880 --> 00:27:05.649
time the plant has run so it's going to
be a number between 0 and 1 okay and

00:27:05.649 --> 00:27:05.659
be a number between 0 and 1 okay and
 

00:27:05.659 --> 00:27:13.240
be a number between 0 and 1 okay and
then I know that then I can draw a

00:27:13.240 --> 00:27:13.250
then I know that then I can draw a
 

00:27:13.250 --> 00:27:16.310
then I know that then I can draw a
linear function I can draw a linear

00:27:16.310 --> 00:27:16.320
linear function I can draw a linear
 

00:27:16.320 --> 00:27:20.779
linear function I can draw a linear

equation that tells me the annual
 

00:27:20.789 --> 00:27:24.669
equation that tells me the annual
revenue requirement or the break-even

00:27:24.669 --> 00:27:24.679
revenue requirement or the break-even
 

00:27:24.679 --> 00:27:29.659

factor for the coal plant that's going
 

00:27:33.330 --> 00:27:36.560
factor for the coal plant that's going
to be equal to the fixed cost to run the

00:27:36.560 --> 00:27:36.570
to be equal to the fixed cost to run the
 

00:27:36.570 --> 00:27:39.799
to be equal to the fixed cost to run the
plant for a whole year regardless of how

00:27:39.799 --> 00:27:39.809
plant for a whole year regardless of how
 

00:27:39.809 --> 00:27:46.930

much I run it plus the variable cost

00:27:46.930 --> 00:27:46.940
much I run it plus the variable cost
 

00:27:46.940 --> 00:27:49.730
much I run it plus the variable cost
times the capacity factor if that's

00:27:49.730 --> 00:27:49.740
times the capacity factor if that's
 

00:27:49.740 --> 00:27:52.310
times the capacity factor if that's
equal to 1 that means that I'm running

00:27:52.310 --> 00:27:52.320
equal to 1 that means that I'm running
 

00:27:52.320 --> 00:27:54.680
equal to 1 that means that I'm running
it 100 percent of the time but if it's

00:27:54.680 --> 00:27:54.690
it 100 percent of the time but if it's
 

00:27:54.690 --> 00:27:57.590
it 100 percent of the time but if it's
less than one if it's point one then

00:27:57.590 --> 00:27:57.600
less than one if it's point one then
 

00:27:57.600 --> 00:28:02.840
less than one if it's point one then
I'll only incur ten percent of this okay

00:28:02.840 --> 00:28:02.850
I'll only incur ten percent of this okay
 

00:28:02.850 --> 00:28:06.169
I'll only incur ten percent of this okay
and so and similarly for the gas turbine

00:28:06.169 --> 00:28:06.179
and so and similarly for the gas turbine
 

00:28:06.179 --> 00:28:12.110
and so and similarly for the gas turbine
fixed cost plus the variable cost times

00:28:12.110 --> 00:28:12.120
fixed cost plus the variable cost times
 

00:28:12.120 --> 00:28:14.390
fixed cost plus the variable cost times
the capacity factor the capacity factors

00:28:14.390 --> 00:28:14.400
the capacity factor the capacity factors
 

00:28:14.400 --> 00:28:18.020
the capacity factor the capacity factors
equal to one then I simply get 30 6 plus

00:28:18.020 --> 00:28:18.030
equal to one then I simply get 30 6 plus
 

00:28:18.030 --> 00:28:26.510
equal to one then I simply get 30 6 plus
40 okay well these are just linear

00:28:26.510 --> 00:28:26.520
40 okay well these are just linear
 

00:28:26.520 --> 00:28:28.250
40 okay well these are just linear
equations like the ones you've seen

00:28:28.250 --> 00:28:28.260
equations like the ones you've seen
 

00:28:28.260 --> 00:28:34.190
equations like the ones you've seen
right this is y equals B plus MX CF is

00:28:34.190 --> 00:28:34.200
right this is y equals B plus MX CF is
 

00:28:34.200 --> 00:28:37.599
right this is y equals B plus MX CF is
equal to X

00:28:37.599 --> 00:28:37.609
 

00:28:37.609 --> 00:28:40.789
these equations are called screening

00:28:40.789 --> 00:28:40.799
these equations are called screening
 

00:28:40.799 --> 00:28:42.799
these equations are called screening
curves eula you probably may even have

00:28:42.799 --> 00:28:42.809
curves eula you probably may even have
 

00:28:42.809 --> 00:28:47.029
curves eula you probably may even have
come across screening curves if you have

00:28:47.029 --> 00:28:47.039
come across screening curves if you have
 

00:28:47.039 --> 00:28:50.060
come across screening curves if you have
heard discussions about wind power

00:28:50.060 --> 00:28:50.070
heard discussions about wind power
 

00:28:50.070 --> 00:28:55.279
heard discussions about wind power
versus nuclear and so on okay so the

00:28:55.279 --> 00:28:55.289
versus nuclear and so on okay so the
 

00:28:55.289 --> 00:28:57.439
versus nuclear and so on okay so the
question is that what capacity factor is

00:28:57.439 --> 00:28:57.449
question is that what capacity factor is
 

00:28:57.449 --> 00:29:03.139
question is that what capacity factor is
the gas turbine the cheaper choice okay

00:29:03.139 --> 00:29:03.149
the gas turbine the cheaper choice okay
 

00:29:03.149 --> 00:29:09.169
the gas turbine the cheaper choice okay
well I have screening curves for the gas

00:29:09.169 --> 00:29:09.179
well I have screening curves for the gas
 

00:29:09.179 --> 00:29:15.499
well I have screening curves for the gas
turbine and the coal plant and here i

00:29:15.499 --> 00:29:15.509
turbine and the coal plant and here i
 

00:29:15.509 --> 00:29:18.109
turbine and the coal plant and here i
can put the capacity factor on the x

00:29:18.109 --> 00:29:18.119
can put the capacity factor on the x
 

00:29:18.119 --> 00:29:23.089
can put the capacity factor on the x
axis and this I could put here I would

00:29:23.089 --> 00:29:23.099
axis and this I could put here I would
 

00:29:23.099 --> 00:29:31.939
axis and this I could put here I would
call this the break-even revenue or it's

00:29:31.939 --> 00:29:31.949
call this the break-even revenue or it's
 

00:29:31.949 --> 00:29:36.949
call this the break-even revenue or it's
also known as the annual revenue

00:29:36.949 --> 00:29:36.959
also known as the annual revenue
 

00:29:36.959 --> 00:29:45.800
also known as the annual revenue
requirement arr

00:29:45.800 --> 00:29:45.810
 

00:29:45.810 --> 00:29:49.250
okay and so for the coal plant I would

00:29:49.250 --> 00:29:49.260
okay and so for the coal plant I would
 

00:29:49.260 --> 00:29:56.930
okay and so for the coal plant I would
start off at 10 696 and I'm going to

00:29:56.930 --> 00:29:56.940
start off at 10 696 and I'm going to
 

00:29:56.940 --> 00:30:01.820
start off at 10 696 and I'm going to
rise and is my rise going to be steep or

00:30:01.820 --> 00:30:01.830
rise and is my rise going to be steep or
 

00:30:01.830 --> 00:30:09.520
rise and is my rise going to be steep or
shallow relative to the gas turbine

00:30:09.520 --> 00:30:09.530
shallow relative to the gas turbine
 

00:30:09.530 --> 00:30:13.280
shallow relative to the gas turbine
shallow right it has a lower slope than

00:30:13.280 --> 00:30:13.290
shallow right it has a lower slope than
 

00:30:13.290 --> 00:30:15.830
shallow right it has a lower slope than
the gas turbine the gas turbine starts

00:30:15.830 --> 00:30:15.840
the gas turbine the gas turbine starts
 

00:30:15.840 --> 00:30:19.070
the gas turbine the gas turbine starts
out at forty dollars and forty-eight

00:30:19.070 --> 00:30:19.080
out at forty dollars and forty-eight
 

00:30:19.080 --> 00:30:23.120
out at forty dollars and forty-eight
cents but it has a quite steep ascent

00:30:23.120 --> 00:30:23.130
cents but it has a quite steep ascent
 

00:30:23.130 --> 00:30:26.240
cents but it has a quite steep ascent
okay so that will go like will look like

00:30:26.240 --> 00:30:26.250
okay so that will go like will look like
 

00:30:26.250 --> 00:30:33.080
okay so that will go like will look like
this so this is the gas turbine and this

00:30:33.080 --> 00:30:33.090
this so this is the gas turbine and this
 

00:30:33.090 --> 00:30:39.190
this so this is the gas turbine and this
is the coal plant okay so you can see

00:30:39.190 --> 00:30:39.200
is the coal plant okay so you can see
 

00:30:39.200 --> 00:30:42.200
is the coal plant okay so you can see
and this is really only defined for a

00:30:42.200 --> 00:30:42.210
and this is really only defined for a
 

00:30:42.210 --> 00:30:45.440
and this is really only defined for a
capacity factor up to one right so from

00:30:45.440 --> 00:30:45.450
capacity factor up to one right so from
 

00:30:45.450 --> 00:30:50.330
capacity factor up to one right so from
0 to 1 you can see that at a capacity

00:30:50.330 --> 00:30:50.340
0 to 1 you can see that at a capacity
 

00:30:50.340 --> 00:30:54.010
0 to 1 you can see that at a capacity
factor of 1 it should be the case that

00:30:54.010 --> 00:30:54.020
factor of 1 it should be the case that
 

00:30:54.020 --> 00:30:57.980
factor of 1 it should be the case that
the gas turbine is more expensive that

00:30:57.980 --> 00:30:57.990
the gas turbine is more expensive that
 

00:30:57.990 --> 00:31:00.980
the gas turbine is more expensive that
is its break-even revenue or its total

00:31:00.980 --> 00:31:00.990
is its break-even revenue or its total
 

00:31:00.990 --> 00:31:04.370
is its break-even revenue or its total
cost is higher than the coal plant okay

00:31:04.370 --> 00:31:04.380
cost is higher than the coal plant okay
 

00:31:04.380 --> 00:31:06.530
cost is higher than the coal plant okay
so when you plot those two equations out

00:31:06.530 --> 00:31:06.540
so when you plot those two equations out
 

00:31:06.540 --> 00:31:09.560
so when you plot those two equations out
this is what it looks like these are the

00:31:09.560 --> 00:31:09.570
this is what it looks like these are the
 

00:31:09.570 --> 00:31:14.290
this is what it looks like these are the
screening curves hey the gas turbine is

00:31:14.290 --> 00:31:14.300
screening curves hey the gas turbine is
 

00:31:14.300 --> 00:31:17.360
screening curves hey the gas turbine is
green because it's supposedly marginally

00:31:17.360 --> 00:31:17.370
green because it's supposedly marginally
 

00:31:17.370 --> 00:31:27.799
green because it's supposedly marginally
cleaner than the Copeland okay okay yes

00:31:27.799 --> 00:31:27.809
 

00:31:27.809 --> 00:31:32.330
like so for example if let's say we had

00:31:32.330 --> 00:31:32.340
like so for example if let's say we had
 

00:31:32.340 --> 00:31:36.710
like so for example if let's say we had
some version of waxman-markey pause and

00:31:36.710 --> 00:31:36.720
some version of waxman-markey pause and
 

00:31:36.720 --> 00:31:41.299
some version of waxman-markey pause and
there is a cost associated with emitting

00:31:41.299 --> 00:31:41.309
there is a cost associated with emitting
 

00:31:41.309 --> 00:31:45.990
there is a cost associated with emitting
so you can translate the price if you

00:31:45.990 --> 00:31:46.000
so you can translate the price if you
 

00:31:46.000 --> 00:31:49.980
so you can translate the price if you
give me the carbon market price if it

00:31:49.980 --> 00:31:49.990
give me the carbon market price if it
 

00:31:49.990 --> 00:31:52.710
give me the carbon market price if it
trades or if there's a tax it's a

00:31:52.710 --> 00:31:52.720
trades or if there's a tax it's a
 

00:31:52.720 --> 00:31:56.580
trades or if there's a tax it's a
natural statutory number let's say that

00:31:56.580 --> 00:31:56.590
natural statutory number let's say that
 

00:31:56.590 --> 00:32:00.680
natural statutory number let's say that
tax is twenty dollars per ton of carbon

00:32:00.680 --> 00:32:00.690
tax is twenty dollars per ton of carbon
 

00:32:00.690 --> 00:32:07.130
tax is twenty dollars per ton of carbon
well for the coal plant I know how many

00:32:07.130 --> 00:32:07.140
well for the coal plant I know how many
 

00:32:07.140 --> 00:32:12.030
well for the coal plant I know how many
kilowatts are generated whose by-product

00:32:12.030 --> 00:32:12.040
kilowatts are generated whose by-product
 

00:32:12.040 --> 00:32:15.900
kilowatts are generated whose by-product
is one ton of carbon right so twenty

00:32:15.900 --> 00:32:15.910
is one ton of carbon right so twenty
 

00:32:15.910 --> 00:32:18.320
is one ton of carbon right so twenty
dollars is going to have to be

00:32:18.320 --> 00:32:18.330
dollars is going to have to be
 

00:32:18.330 --> 00:32:22.760
dollars is going to have to be
translated into a per kilowatt cost and

00:32:22.760 --> 00:32:22.770
translated into a per kilowatt cost and
 

00:32:22.770 --> 00:32:25.770
translated into a per kilowatt cost and
let's say that that / killer what cost

00:32:25.770 --> 00:32:25.780
let's say that that / killer what cost
 

00:32:25.780 --> 00:32:31.890
let's say that that / killer what cost
is ten dollars then I would add to this

00:32:31.890 --> 00:32:31.900
is ten dollars then I would add to this
 

00:32:31.900 --> 00:32:36.060
is ten dollars then I would add to this
slope I would add that ten dollars so up

00:32:36.060 --> 00:32:36.070
slope I would add that ten dollars so up
 

00:32:36.070 --> 00:32:40.830
slope I would add that ten dollars so up
here so instead of 8750 would be 9760 so

00:32:40.830 --> 00:32:40.840
here so instead of 8750 would be 9760 so
 

00:32:40.840 --> 00:32:45.530
here so instead of 8750 would be 9760 so
the slope would become steeper okay so

00:32:45.530 --> 00:32:45.540
the slope would become steeper okay so
 

00:32:45.540 --> 00:32:49.799
the slope would become steeper okay so
policy would have the impact of making

00:32:49.799 --> 00:32:49.809
policy would have the impact of making
 

00:32:49.809 --> 00:32:53.340
policy would have the impact of making
this line steeper it wouldn't change the

00:32:53.340 --> 00:32:53.350
this line steeper it wouldn't change the
 

00:32:53.350 --> 00:32:58.340
this line steeper it wouldn't change the
intercept it would make it steeper and

00:32:58.340 --> 00:32:58.350
intercept it would make it steeper and
 

00:32:58.350 --> 00:33:02.940
intercept it would make it steeper and
it's possible it's possible of not so

00:33:02.940 --> 00:33:02.950
it's possible it's possible of not so
 

00:33:02.950 --> 00:33:04.830
it's possible it's possible of not so
much with gas turbines but if you had

00:33:04.830 --> 00:33:04.840
much with gas turbines but if you had
 

00:33:04.840 --> 00:33:09.799
much with gas turbines but if you had
nuclear or solar solar is not really

00:33:09.799 --> 00:33:09.809
nuclear or solar solar is not really
 

00:33:09.809 --> 00:33:13.560
nuclear or solar solar is not really
industrial scale maybe wind it's

00:33:13.560 --> 00:33:13.570
industrial scale maybe wind it's
 

00:33:13.570 --> 00:33:17.820
industrial scale maybe wind it's
possible that it might bring the this

00:33:17.820 --> 00:33:17.830
possible that it might bring the this
 

00:33:17.830 --> 00:33:22.530
possible that it might bring the this
slope down because of the way that those

00:33:22.530 --> 00:33:22.540
slope down because of the way that those
 

00:33:22.540 --> 00:33:27.900
slope down because of the way that those
permits are issued in advance usually 40

00:33:27.900 --> 00:33:27.910
permits are issued in advance usually 40
 

00:33:27.910 --> 00:33:31.020
permits are issued in advance usually 40
cost so it's like a subsidy that's

00:33:31.020 --> 00:33:31.030
cost so it's like a subsidy that's
 

00:33:31.030 --> 00:33:34.919
cost so it's like a subsidy that's
provided to the power generators and so

00:33:34.919 --> 00:33:34.929
provided to the power generators and so
 

00:33:34.929 --> 00:33:37.710
provided to the power generators and so
in theory the

00:33:37.710 --> 00:33:37.720
in theory the
 

00:33:37.720 --> 00:33:40.560
in theory the
um the nuclear power producers who

00:33:40.560 --> 00:33:40.570
um the nuclear power producers who
 

00:33:40.570 --> 00:33:43.530
um the nuclear power producers who
obviously are backing this will get a

00:33:43.530 --> 00:33:43.540
obviously are backing this will get a
 

00:33:43.540 --> 00:33:47.760
obviously are backing this will get a
huge windfall and the potential benefits

00:33:47.760 --> 00:33:47.770
huge windfall and the potential benefits
 

00:33:47.770 --> 00:33:50.730
huge windfall and the potential benefits
that they get from it should be

00:33:50.730 --> 00:33:50.740
that they get from it should be
 

00:33:50.740 --> 00:33:52.860
that they get from it should be
amortized over each mega what they

00:33:52.860 --> 00:33:52.870
amortized over each mega what they
 

00:33:52.870 --> 00:33:59.150
amortized over each mega what they
produce so the nuclear power plants

00:33:59.150 --> 00:33:59.160
 

00:33:59.160 --> 00:34:02.550
slope would be brought down by a permit

00:34:02.550 --> 00:34:02.560
slope would be brought down by a permit
 

00:34:02.560 --> 00:34:05.040
slope would be brought down by a permit
price so would it would look more

00:34:05.040 --> 00:34:05.050
price so would it would look more
 

00:34:05.050 --> 00:34:07.020
price so would it would look more
competitive the problem with nucleus it

00:34:07.020 --> 00:34:07.030
competitive the problem with nucleus it
 

00:34:07.030 --> 00:34:09.570
competitive the problem with nucleus it
doesn't look like this nucleus starts up

00:34:09.570 --> 00:34:09.580
doesn't look like this nucleus starts up
 

00:34:09.580 --> 00:34:12.030
doesn't look like this nucleus starts up
here because it has a very high fixed

00:34:12.030 --> 00:34:12.040
here because it has a very high fixed
 

00:34:12.040 --> 00:34:15.570
here because it has a very high fixed
cost and then it's relatively flat so

00:34:15.570 --> 00:34:15.580
cost and then it's relatively flat so
 

00:34:15.580 --> 00:34:17.910
cost and then it's relatively flat so
actually with what happens with nuclear

00:34:17.910 --> 00:34:17.920
actually with what happens with nuclear
 

00:34:17.920 --> 00:34:21.390
actually with what happens with nuclear
is if you add a carbon price since they

00:34:21.390 --> 00:34:21.400
is if you add a carbon price since they
 

00:34:21.400 --> 00:34:23.760
is if you add a carbon price since they
get paid for not generating the carbon

00:34:23.760 --> 00:34:23.770
get paid for not generating the carbon
 

00:34:23.770 --> 00:34:28.350
get paid for not generating the carbon
nuclear looks like this okay which is

00:34:28.350 --> 00:34:28.360
nuclear looks like this okay which is
 

00:34:28.360 --> 00:34:30.630
nuclear looks like this okay which is
the reason that the nuclear power

00:34:30.630 --> 00:34:30.640
the reason that the nuclear power
 

00:34:30.640 --> 00:34:35.460
the reason that the nuclear power
companies were major supporters of that

00:34:35.460 --> 00:34:35.470
companies were major supporters of that
 

00:34:35.470 --> 00:34:41.760
companies were major supporters of that
process sorry cap and trade all the tax

00:34:41.760 --> 00:34:41.770
process sorry cap and trade all the tax
 

00:34:41.770 --> 00:34:53.760
process sorry cap and trade all the tax
either one yes

00:34:53.760 --> 00:34:53.770
 

00:34:53.770 --> 00:34:58.870
right so let's yeah so let I think I I

00:34:58.870 --> 00:34:58.880
right so let's yeah so let I think I I
 

00:34:58.880 --> 00:35:01.690
right so let's yeah so let I think I I
was i I was a little quick in explaining

00:35:01.690 --> 00:35:01.700
was i I was a little quick in explaining
 

00:35:01.700 --> 00:35:09.819
was i I was a little quick in explaining
that this graph is drawn for the

00:35:09.819 --> 00:35:09.829
that this graph is drawn for the
 

00:35:09.829 --> 00:35:13.329
that this graph is drawn for the
capacity factor as a variable where if

00:35:13.329 --> 00:35:13.339
capacity factor as a variable where if
 

00:35:13.339 --> 00:35:16.240
capacity factor as a variable where if
this is saying that if the capacity

00:35:16.240 --> 00:35:16.250
this is saying that if the capacity
 

00:35:16.250 --> 00:35:19.240
this is saying that if the capacity
factor was a hundred percent then CF

00:35:19.240 --> 00:35:19.250
factor was a hundred percent then CF
 

00:35:19.250 --> 00:35:22.390
factor was a hundred percent then CF
would be equal to 1 so this is how much

00:35:22.390 --> 00:35:22.400
would be equal to 1 so this is how much
 

00:35:22.400 --> 00:35:24.970
would be equal to 1 so this is how much
the the coal plant would cost me this

00:35:24.970 --> 00:35:24.980
the the coal plant would cost me this
 

00:35:24.980 --> 00:35:28.920
the the coal plant would cost me this
how much the gas turbine would cost so

00:35:28.920 --> 00:35:28.930
how much the gas turbine would cost so
 

00:35:28.930 --> 00:35:35.520
how much the gas turbine would cost so
because coal plants a jet well because

00:35:35.520 --> 00:35:35.530
 

00:35:35.530 --> 00:35:42.970
so in demand situations where say demand

00:35:42.970 --> 00:35:42.980
so in demand situations where say demand
 

00:35:42.980 --> 00:35:45.430
so in demand situations where say demand
is quite varied if you look at the peak

00:35:45.430 --> 00:35:45.440
is quite varied if you look at the peak
 

00:35:45.440 --> 00:35:49.390
is quite varied if you look at the peak
to trough electricity demand it's for a

00:35:49.390 --> 00:35:49.400
to trough electricity demand it's for a
 

00:35:49.400 --> 00:35:52.089
to trough electricity demand it's for a
city is in in the orders of magnitude of

00:35:52.089 --> 00:35:52.099
city is in in the orders of magnitude of
 

00:35:52.099 --> 00:35:57.910
city is in in the orders of magnitude of
10 to 15 times ok so what so that what

00:35:57.910 --> 00:35:57.920
10 to 15 times ok so what so that what
 

00:35:57.920 --> 00:36:00.730
10 to 15 times ok so what so that what
that means is the capacity factor if you

00:36:00.730 --> 00:36:00.740
that means is the capacity factor if you
 

00:36:00.740 --> 00:36:04.920
that means is the capacity factor if you
were building power plants to meet a

00:36:04.920 --> 00:36:04.930
were building power plants to meet a
 

00:36:04.930 --> 00:36:08.230
were building power plants to meet a
hundred percent of peak capacity there'd

00:36:08.230 --> 00:36:08.240
hundred percent of peak capacity there'd
 

00:36:08.240 --> 00:36:10.890
hundred percent of peak capacity there'd
be times when you were only running a

00:36:10.890 --> 00:36:10.900
be times when you were only running a
 

00:36:10.900 --> 00:36:14.380
be times when you were only running a
ten percent capacity right so you can't

00:36:14.380 --> 00:36:14.390
ten percent capacity right so you can't
 

00:36:14.390 --> 00:36:18.220
ten percent capacity right so you can't
have the same technology to meet that

00:36:18.220 --> 00:36:18.230
have the same technology to meet that
 

00:36:18.230 --> 00:36:24.160
have the same technology to meet that
entire profile of demand so you because

00:36:24.160 --> 00:36:24.170
entire profile of demand so you because
 

00:36:24.170 --> 00:36:27.150
entire profile of demand so you because
of the fixed and variable costs here if

00:36:27.150 --> 00:36:27.160
of the fixed and variable costs here if
 

00:36:27.160 --> 00:36:29.920
of the fixed and variable costs here if
you think that your power plant is going

00:36:29.920 --> 00:36:29.930
you think that your power plant is going
 

00:36:29.930 --> 00:36:32.260
you think that your power plant is going
to run seventy percent of the time you

00:36:32.260 --> 00:36:32.270
to run seventy percent of the time you
 

00:36:32.270 --> 00:36:35.890
to run seventy percent of the time you
should pick a coal plant if you think

00:36:35.890 --> 00:36:35.900
should pick a coal plant if you think
 

00:36:35.900 --> 00:36:37.839
should pick a coal plant if you think
it's going to run only twenty percent of

00:36:37.839 --> 00:36:37.849
it's going to run only twenty percent of
 

00:36:37.849 --> 00:36:43.319
it's going to run only twenty percent of
the time you should pick the gas turbine

00:36:43.319 --> 00:36:43.329
the time you should pick the gas turbine
 

00:36:43.329 --> 00:36:47.380
the time you should pick the gas turbine
yes so suppose for example that you you

00:36:47.380 --> 00:36:47.390
yes so suppose for example that you you
 

00:36:47.390 --> 00:36:49.120
yes so suppose for example that you you
why do you need to build a new plant

00:36:49.120 --> 00:36:49.130
why do you need to build a new plant
 

00:36:49.130 --> 00:36:51.930
why do you need to build a new plant
presumably there's some shortage of

00:36:51.930 --> 00:36:51.940
presumably there's some shortage of
 

00:36:51.940 --> 00:36:55.150
presumably there's some shortage of
generated electricity now you have to

00:36:55.150 --> 00:36:55.160
generated electricity now you have to
 

00:36:55.160 --> 00:36:58.089
generated electricity now you have to
determine what the size of your new

00:36:58.089 --> 00:36:58.099
determine what the size of your new
 

00:36:58.099 --> 00:37:01.180
determine what the size of your new
plant is going to be relative to your

00:37:01.180 --> 00:37:01.190
plant is going to be relative to your
 

00:37:01.190 --> 00:37:04.390
plant is going to be relative to your
shortage now what is that shortage that

00:37:04.390 --> 00:37:04.400
shortage now what is that shortage that
 

00:37:04.400 --> 00:37:07.480
shortage now what is that shortage that
shortage is not one number clearly

00:37:07.480 --> 00:37:07.490
shortage is not one number clearly
 

00:37:07.490 --> 00:37:11.620
shortage is not one number clearly
it is very high at peak periods and low

00:37:11.620 --> 00:37:11.630
it is very high at peak periods and low
 

00:37:11.630 --> 00:37:15.670
it is very high at peak periods and low
at off-peak periods okay so there's a

00:37:15.670 --> 00:37:15.680
at off-peak periods okay so there's a
 

00:37:15.680 --> 00:37:18.660
at off-peak periods okay so there's a
range of demand that you need to meet

00:37:18.660 --> 00:37:18.670
range of demand that you need to meet
 

00:37:18.670 --> 00:37:23.950
range of demand that you need to meet
now if you're if you are able to meet

00:37:23.950 --> 00:37:23.960
now if you're if you are able to meet
 

00:37:23.960 --> 00:37:31.060
now if you're if you are able to meet
that peak shortfall with this new plant

00:37:31.060 --> 00:37:31.070
that peak shortfall with this new plant
 

00:37:31.070 --> 00:37:34.600
that peak shortfall with this new plant
that you're going to build then you know

00:37:34.600 --> 00:37:34.610
that you're going to build then you know
 

00:37:34.610 --> 00:37:38.530
that you're going to build then you know
that it's going to run at the peak

00:37:38.530 --> 00:37:38.540
that it's going to run at the peak
 

00:37:38.540 --> 00:37:41.350
that it's going to run at the peak
period but it's probably not going to

00:37:41.350 --> 00:37:41.360
period but it's probably not going to
 

00:37:41.360 --> 00:37:45.700
period but it's probably not going to
run at the off-peak period so that means

00:37:45.700 --> 00:37:45.710
run at the off-peak period so that means
 

00:37:45.710 --> 00:37:47.109
run at the off-peak period so that means
this is a plant that you're going to put

00:37:47.109 --> 00:37:47.119
this is a plant that you're going to put
 

00:37:47.119 --> 00:37:49.359
this is a plant that you're going to put
on but it's not going to run seventy

00:37:49.359 --> 00:37:49.369
on but it's not going to run seventy
 

00:37:49.369 --> 00:37:50.560
on but it's not going to run seventy
percent of the time it's only going to

00:37:50.560 --> 00:37:50.570
percent of the time it's only going to
 

00:37:50.570 --> 00:37:52.600
percent of the time it's only going to
run twenty percent of the time so you

00:37:52.600 --> 00:37:52.610
run twenty percent of the time so you
 

00:37:52.610 --> 00:37:57.520
run twenty percent of the time so you
would want to make a gas turbine but if

00:37:57.520 --> 00:37:57.530
would want to make a gas turbine but if
 

00:37:57.530 --> 00:38:00.700
would want to make a gas turbine but if
on the other hand you have you know so

00:38:00.700 --> 00:38:00.710
on the other hand you have you know so
 

00:38:00.710 --> 00:38:03.630
on the other hand you have you know so
that's that would be a situation like

00:38:03.630 --> 00:38:03.640
that's that would be a situation like
 

00:38:03.640 --> 00:38:06.280
that's that would be a situation like
building a peak plant in Long Island

00:38:06.280 --> 00:38:06.290
building a peak plant in Long Island
 

00:38:06.290 --> 00:38:09.880
building a peak plant in Long Island
City to meet summertime demand but let's

00:38:09.880 --> 00:38:09.890
City to meet summertime demand but let's
 

00:38:09.890 --> 00:38:14.710
City to meet summertime demand but let's
say that you're in India where routinely

00:38:14.710 --> 00:38:14.720
say that you're in India where routinely
 

00:38:14.720 --> 00:38:19.720
say that you're in India where routinely
there is load shedding then your power

00:38:19.720 --> 00:38:19.730
there is load shedding then your power
 

00:38:19.730 --> 00:38:23.260
there is load shedding then your power
shortage is not I mean certainly you

00:38:23.260 --> 00:38:23.270
shortage is not I mean certainly you
 

00:38:23.270 --> 00:38:25.060
shortage is not I mean certainly you
have a power shortage of peak periods

00:38:25.060 --> 00:38:25.070
have a power shortage of peak periods
 

00:38:25.070 --> 00:38:26.470
have a power shortage of peak periods
but you probably even have a power

00:38:26.470 --> 00:38:26.480
but you probably even have a power
 

00:38:26.480 --> 00:38:31.540
but you probably even have a power
shortage at base load so the new plant

00:38:31.540 --> 00:38:31.550
shortage at base load so the new plant
 

00:38:31.550 --> 00:38:34.000
shortage at base load so the new plant
that you bring online is going to run

00:38:34.000 --> 00:38:34.010
that you bring online is going to run
 

00:38:34.010 --> 00:38:36.820
that you bring online is going to run
seventy percent of the time it's got to

00:38:36.820 --> 00:38:36.830
seventy percent of the time it's got to
 

00:38:36.830 --> 00:38:39.460
seventy percent of the time it's got to
feed power both at off peak and peak

00:38:39.460 --> 00:38:39.470
feed power both at off peak and peak
 

00:38:39.470 --> 00:38:41.440
feed power both at off peak and peak
periods so then you're going to build a

00:38:41.440 --> 00:38:41.450
periods so then you're going to build a
 

00:38:41.450 --> 00:38:48.250
periods so then you're going to build a
coal plant so you know that's this is

00:38:48.250 --> 00:38:48.260
coal plant so you know that's this is
 

00:38:48.260 --> 00:38:51.880
coal plant so you know that's this is
basically a method of choosing the

00:38:51.880 --> 00:38:51.890
basically a method of choosing the
 

00:38:51.890 --> 00:38:56.140
basically a method of choosing the
cheapest way the cheapest generating

00:38:56.140 --> 00:38:56.150
cheapest way the cheapest generating
 

00:38:56.150 --> 00:38:58.830
cheapest way the cheapest generating
technology not taking into account

00:38:58.830 --> 00:38:58.840
technology not taking into account
 

00:38:58.840 --> 00:39:03.430
technology not taking into account
externalities if the prices exist for

00:39:03.430 --> 00:39:03.440
externalities if the prices exist for
 

00:39:03.440 --> 00:39:06.520
externalities if the prices exist for
the externalities you would you would be

00:39:06.520 --> 00:39:06.530
the externalities you would you would be
 

00:39:06.530 --> 00:39:08.230
the externalities you would you would be
able to take it account take account of

00:39:08.230 --> 00:39:08.240
able to take it account take account of
 

00:39:08.240 --> 00:39:12.130
able to take it account take account of
it in this framework okay so so you

00:39:12.130 --> 00:39:12.140
it in this framework okay so so you
 

00:39:12.140 --> 00:39:14.980
it in this framework okay so so you
could so this is of course just a system

00:39:14.980 --> 00:39:14.990
could so this is of course just a system
 

00:39:14.990 --> 00:39:20.080
could so this is of course just a system
of two linear equations and just like

00:39:20.080 --> 00:39:20.090
of two linear equations and just like
 

00:39:20.090 --> 00:39:20.930
of two linear equations and just like
those

00:39:20.930 --> 00:39:20.940
those
 

00:39:20.940 --> 00:39:23.630
those
pull linear equations you saw before

00:39:23.630 --> 00:39:23.640
pull linear equations you saw before
 

00:39:23.640 --> 00:39:26.690
pull linear equations you saw before
there is a point where they intersect so

00:39:26.690 --> 00:39:26.700
there is a point where they intersect so
 

00:39:26.700 --> 00:39:28.609
there is a point where they intersect so
you know and that point happens to be 0

00:39:28.609 --> 00:39:28.619
you know and that point happens to be 0
 

00:39:28.619 --> 00:39:33.020
you know and that point happens to be 0
point 304 so you know that if your

00:39:33.020 --> 00:39:33.030
point 304 so you know that if your
 

00:39:33.030 --> 00:39:35.420
point 304 so you know that if your
capacity factor is less than that you're

00:39:35.420 --> 00:39:35.430
capacity factor is less than that you're
 

00:39:35.430 --> 00:39:37.880
capacity factor is less than that you're
going to go with gas if it's more than

00:39:37.880 --> 00:39:37.890
going to go with gas if it's more than
 

00:39:37.890 --> 00:39:39.800
going to go with gas if it's more than
that you're going to go with coal and in

00:39:39.800 --> 00:39:39.810
that you're going to go with coal and in
 

00:39:39.810 --> 00:39:43.040
that you're going to go with coal and in
reality you would have many different

00:39:43.040 --> 00:39:43.050
reality you would have many different
 

00:39:43.050 --> 00:39:45.260
reality you would have many different
screening curves for every different

00:39:45.260 --> 00:39:45.270
screening curves for every different
 

00:39:45.270 --> 00:39:46.700
screening curves for every different
technology and you'll see that they

00:39:46.700 --> 00:39:46.710
technology and you'll see that they
 

00:39:46.710 --> 00:39:49.849
technology and you'll see that they
intersect in different places okay and

00:39:49.849 --> 00:39:49.859
intersect in different places okay and
 

00:39:49.859 --> 00:39:52.640
intersect in different places okay and
part of policy is how do these things

00:39:52.640 --> 00:39:52.650
part of policy is how do these things
 

00:39:52.650 --> 00:39:55.250
part of policy is how do these things
move around when you put in a permit

00:39:55.250 --> 00:39:55.260
move around when you put in a permit
 

00:39:55.260 --> 00:39:57.559
move around when you put in a permit
price or when you change the interest

00:39:57.559 --> 00:39:57.569
price or when you change the interest
 

00:39:57.569 --> 00:40:01.220
price or when you change the interest
rate which will have a huge impact on

00:40:01.220 --> 00:40:01.230
rate which will have a huge impact on
 

00:40:01.230 --> 00:40:08.480
rate which will have a huge impact on
this too yes yeah that's factored in

00:40:08.480 --> 00:40:08.490
this too yes yeah that's factored in
 

00:40:08.490 --> 00:40:11.359
this too yes yeah that's factored in
already so you see that's that's exactly

00:40:11.359 --> 00:40:11.369
already so you see that's that's exactly
 

00:40:11.369 --> 00:40:12.859
already so you see that's that's exactly
what you were doing so that's a very

00:40:12.859 --> 00:40:12.869
what you were doing so that's a very
 

00:40:12.869 --> 00:40:14.569
what you were doing so that's a very
good question that's what you were doing

00:40:14.569 --> 00:40:14.579
good question that's what you were doing
 

00:40:14.579 --> 00:40:17.450
good question that's what you were doing
when you made this calculation you were

00:40:17.450 --> 00:40:17.460
when you made this calculation you were
 

00:40:17.460 --> 00:40:20.770
when you made this calculation you were
taking the levelized animal fixed cost

00:40:20.770 --> 00:40:20.780
taking the levelized animal fixed cost
 

00:40:20.780 --> 00:40:24.980
taking the levelized animal fixed cost
so you are saying yes it's this gas

00:40:24.980 --> 00:40:24.990
so you are saying yes it's this gas
 

00:40:24.990 --> 00:40:27.650
so you are saying yes it's this gas
turbine only lives for 20 years but I've

00:40:27.650 --> 00:40:27.660
turbine only lives for 20 years but I've
 

00:40:27.660 --> 00:40:30.620
turbine only lives for 20 years but I've
converted that into an annual cost so

00:40:30.620 --> 00:40:30.630
converted that into an annual cost so
 

00:40:30.630 --> 00:40:33.230
converted that into an annual cost so
that the variable and fixed costs are in

00:40:33.230 --> 00:40:33.240
that the variable and fixed costs are in
 

00:40:33.240 --> 00:40:38.359
that the variable and fixed costs are in
the same units ok so these these costs

00:40:38.359 --> 00:40:38.369
the same units ok so these these costs
 

00:40:38.369 --> 00:40:46.599
the same units ok so these these costs
are per year costs ok that's it any

00:40:46.599 --> 00:40:46.609
are per year costs ok that's it any
 

00:40:46.609 --> 00:40:54.779
are per year costs ok that's it any
questions ok thank you

00:40:54.779 --> 00:40:54.789
 

00:40:54.789 --> 00:40:56.799
okay i'll see you tomorrow at

00:40:56.799 --> 00:40:56.809
okay i'll see you tomorrow at
 

00:40:56.809 --> 00:40:59.349
okay i'll see you tomorrow at
orientation
