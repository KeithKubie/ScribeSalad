as level language skills physics is a
 

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:28.830
as level language skills physics is a
very interesting field because you can

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:28.840
very interesting field because you can
 

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:30.620

when I was in college I didn't like

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:35.440
when I was in college I didn't like
 

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:37.980
when I was in college I didn't like
physics a lot and I really wasn't very

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:37.990
physics a lot and I really wasn't very
 

00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:41.310
physics a lot and I really wasn't very
good at physics and there were a lot of

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:41.320
good at physics and there were a lot of
 

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:42.990
good at physics and there were a lot of
people around me who were really good at

00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:43.000
people around me who were really good at
 

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:43.620
people around me who were really good at
physics

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:43.630

it means scary good at physics and they

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:45.550
it means scary good at physics and they
 

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:47.280
it means scary good at physics and they
weren't much help to me because I'd say

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:47.290
weren't much help to me because I'd say
 

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:49.140
weren't much help to me because I'd say
how do you do this and say well it's

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:49.150
how do you do this and say well it's
 

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:52.260
how do you do this and say well it's
just the answers obvious and I would sit

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:52.270
just the answers obvious and I would sit
 

00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:55.440
just the answers obvious and I would sit
there going not to me so I chose not to

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:55.450
there going not to me so I chose not to
 

00:02:55.450 --> 00:02:57.870
there going not to me so I chose not to
major in physics a lot of astronomers

00:02:57.870 --> 00:02:57.880
major in physics a lot of astronomers
 

00:02:57.880 --> 00:03:00.120
major in physics a lot of astronomers
and astrophysicists astrophysicists has

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:00.130
and astrophysicists astrophysicists has
 

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:01.770
and astrophysicists astrophysicists has
the word physics right in there do major

00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:01.780
the word physics right in there do major
 

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:04.290
the word physics right in there do major
in physics I chose instead to major in

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:04.300
in physics I chose instead to major in
 

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:06.870
in physics I chose instead to major in
earth and planetary science and so my

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:06.880
earth and planetary science and so my
 

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:08.850
earth and planetary science and so my
background was in courses like geology

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:08.860
background was in courses like geology
 

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:12.390

geophysics atmospheric chemistry but

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:12.400
geophysics atmospheric chemistry but
 

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:14.820
geophysics atmospheric chemistry but
again a lot of math courses and basic

00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:14.830
again a lot of math courses and basic
 

00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:16.790
again a lot of math courses and basic
physics courses things like the

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:16.800
physics courses things like the
 

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:19.440
physics courses things like the
Newtonian physics all the way through

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:19.450
Newtonian physics all the way through
 

00:03:19.450 --> 00:03:21.180
Newtonian physics all the way through
quantum physics I did take those courses

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:21.190
quantum physics I did take those courses
 

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:23.430
quantum physics I did take those courses
I wasn't good at them but I passed them

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:23.440
I wasn't good at them but I passed them
 

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:26.670
I wasn't good at them but I passed them
I learned them enough to pass a C is a
