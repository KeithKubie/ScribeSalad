00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.417
BRANDON BARRAS: Think probably
what we want to try and say

00:00:02.417 --> 00:00:03.030
is this.

00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:07.832
This is probably--
no, it's not--

00:00:07.832 --> 00:00:08.790
MAXIM MAI: [INAUDIBLE].

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:10.255
BRANDON BARRAS:
Not quite doing it.

00:00:10.255 --> 00:00:10.630
MAXIM MAI: No.

00:00:10.630 --> 00:00:12.672
BRANDON BARRAS: What if
we-- what if we try this?

00:00:12.672 --> 00:00:14.370
Try this.

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:15.904
MAXIM MAI: Let's try this.

00:00:15.904 --> 00:00:18.180
AUDIENCE: Woo!

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:18.680
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:19.972
BRANDON BARRAS: Think that was?

00:00:19.972 --> 00:00:21.760
MAXIM MAI: Oh, yeah.

00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:22.505
All right.

00:00:22.505 --> 00:00:24.830
Looks like people
maybe understood

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:26.607
that a little bit better.

00:00:26.607 --> 00:00:28.940
BRANDON BARRAS: But I think
more importantly, what we're

00:00:28.940 --> 00:00:32.100
actually trying to say is this.

00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:34.250
MAXIM MAI: So thank
you again, Nico.

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:37.040
Welcome to our talk
on developing apps

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:41.840
that are more accessible
and inclusive for all users.

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:43.503
My name is Maxim.

00:00:43.503 --> 00:00:45.170
BRANDON BARRAS: And
I am Brandon Barras.

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:48.020
And both Max and I sit on the
Google Business Development

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:49.740
Team in New York.

00:00:49.740 --> 00:00:52.280
And as Nico mentioned,
we were lucky enough

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:55.430
to steal Max away from the
Berlin team to New York.

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:57.590
But I know he's very excited
to be back here today

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:59.130
presenting to this crowd.

00:00:59.130 --> 00:00:59.890
MAXIM MAI: Woo!

00:00:59.890 --> 00:01:00.500
Go Berlin.

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:03.200
[APPLAUSE]

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:05.360
So let's have a very
quick show of hands.

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:10.070
Who of you here were easily
able to read the slides

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:13.070
and able to understand what
we were signing just now?

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:20.320
OK, well, it's not a
ton of hands up there.

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:22.075
Should we quickly say
what we were doing?

00:01:22.075 --> 00:01:22.950
BRANDON BARRAS: Sure.

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:25.180
MAXIM MAI: So I was saying
herzlich willkommen.

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:26.680
BRANDON BARRAS: And
I was attempting

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:30.780
to sign good afternoon.

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:34.080
And here at Google, we
believe that we just

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:36.667
wanted to give you
guys a small glimpse

00:01:36.667 --> 00:01:39.000
or a small taste of what it
might have been like to have

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.480
an inaccessible experience, an
experience that wasn't designed

00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:43.995
with your needs in mind.

00:01:43.995 --> 00:01:45.870
And here at Google, we
believe that everybody

00:01:45.870 --> 00:01:47.370
should be able to
have an accessible

00:01:47.370 --> 00:01:49.830
experience, especially when
it comes to your favorite apps

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:51.190
and games.

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:54.660
So let's start by defining what
do we mean here at Google when

00:01:54.660 --> 00:01:57.510
we say accessibility?

00:01:57.510 --> 00:02:02.510
And accessibility refers to the
designs of products, devices,

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:06.648
services, or environments that
works to include everybody.

00:02:06.648 --> 00:02:08.440
And what you'll hopefully
see is that we've

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:10.960
tried to bring the
principles of this statement

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:12.623
into our deck today.

00:02:12.623 --> 00:02:15.040
So you're going to see things
like clear and simple slides

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:17.170
to convey our
messaging, high color

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:19.990
contrast for the optimal
visual experience.

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:22.600
We're going to do our very
best to try and talk and pace

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:23.680
slowly.

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:25.835
So that can be sometimes
a problem from people

00:02:25.835 --> 00:02:26.710
who live in New York.

00:02:26.710 --> 00:02:29.760
So bear with us.

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:33.460
And according to the World
Health Organization, about 15%

00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:36.240
of the world lives with
some sort of disability.

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:40.210
That's over 1 billion
people, over 1 billion people

00:02:40.210 --> 00:02:42.100
who require some
sort of accessibility

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:46.230
need to live their
everyday lives.

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:47.880
And accessibility
needs may be caused

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:51.480
by disabilities that are
temporary or situational

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:54.120
such as being deaf
or hard of hearing,

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:56.220
having some sort of
motor impairment,

00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:58.140
having some sort of
cognitive disability

00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:00.480
that might impede
learning, or blindness

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:02.238
and visual impairments.

00:03:02.238 --> 00:03:03.780
And I think it's
probably safe to say

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:06.690
that most folks in
this room have either

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:10.110
been directly or
indirectly impacted

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:11.850
by one of these categories.

00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:13.890
I know both Max and I
have personally been,

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:17.332
which is why we're excited to be
here talking to you guys today.

00:03:17.332 --> 00:03:18.790
And we wanted to
take a moment just

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:22.180
to zoom in on one of those
categories, a category that's

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:25.090
probably most relevant
for the folks in this room

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:27.730
if you're creating
touch app experiences.

00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:31.120
And that's looking at the
over 250 million people

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:33.220
who live with some sort
of visual impairment

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:34.722
on a daily basis.

00:03:34.722 --> 00:03:37.180
And we really just wanted to
give you a little more context

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:41.240
to the size of that user base,
to the size of that audience.

00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:43.200
And if you look at that
number, that number

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:45.820
is larger than the
country of Brazil.

00:03:45.820 --> 00:03:48.710
It would be the fifth largest
country behind Indonesia

00:03:48.710 --> 00:03:50.200
and the United States.

00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:52.660
And that number doesn't
even take into account

00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:55.810
the additional
342 million people

00:03:55.810 --> 00:04:00.510
that live with some sort of
colorblindness every day.

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:02.760
And creating an app
experience that's

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:05.460
accessible for your
users not only helps

00:04:05.460 --> 00:04:06.845
folks with disabilities.

00:04:06.845 --> 00:04:08.970
But think of a time in your
life where maybe you've

00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:11.850
had an inaccessible experience,
either with your favorite app

00:04:11.850 --> 00:04:16.200
or game or just with
life in general.

00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:18.370
And beyond disabilities,
accessibility

00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:19.982
can be very situational.

00:04:19.982 --> 00:04:21.399
Think of a time
where maybe you've

00:04:21.399 --> 00:04:23.066
been in a crowded
restaurant, and you're

00:04:23.066 --> 00:04:25.297
trying to hear audio
or a conversation.

00:04:25.297 --> 00:04:27.130
Or maybe you're in a
low lighting situation.

00:04:27.130 --> 00:04:29.422
And you haven't been able to
see your phone or your app

00:04:29.422 --> 00:04:31.452
or anything in the
way you wanted to.

00:04:31.452 --> 00:04:33.160
Or think of a time
where you've just been

00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:35.350
frustrated in any situation.

00:04:35.350 --> 00:04:36.700
Maybe you're holding a baby.

00:04:36.700 --> 00:04:38.410
Maybe you're holding
a bag of groceries.

00:04:38.410 --> 00:04:39.723
Maybe you're holding anything.

00:04:39.723 --> 00:04:41.890
And you haven't been able
to interact with something

00:04:41.890 --> 00:04:44.510
the way that you want to
or the way you expect to.

00:04:44.510 --> 00:04:47.820
It can be very frustrating.

00:04:47.820 --> 00:04:50.250
And when we talk to our
developer ecosystem,

00:04:50.250 --> 00:04:53.580
we often hear that accessibility
is top of mind and something

00:04:53.580 --> 00:04:55.570
that they're looking
to prioritize.

00:04:55.570 --> 00:04:58.410
But we found a much different
and frankly, a little scarier,

00:04:58.410 --> 00:05:03.240
result when we ran our quarterly
developer satisfaction survey.

00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:06.180
And during that survey, we
asked our developer ecosystem

00:05:06.180 --> 00:05:08.640
how they were approaching
accessibility, and more

00:05:08.640 --> 00:05:11.310
importantly, how they were
approaching accessibility use

00:05:11.310 --> 00:05:14.080
cases and how they
were testing for them.

00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:16.680
And what we found
is that nearly 80%

00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:19.500
of the ecosystems
who responded said

00:05:19.500 --> 00:05:22.590
that they don't accommodate
for accessibility at all.

00:05:22.590 --> 00:05:25.560
Obviously, that's something that
both Max and I want to change,

00:05:25.560 --> 00:05:28.320
both by bringing more awareness
to the topic, the importance

00:05:28.320 --> 00:05:31.200
of the topic, as well as
outlining all the great tools

00:05:31.200 --> 00:05:33.630
and resources that you
as developers can start

00:05:33.630 --> 00:05:35.850
to take advantage of to
create more accessible

00:05:35.850 --> 00:05:38.280
and inclusive experiences.

00:05:38.280 --> 00:05:40.292
And the good news is is
that we're here to help.

00:05:40.292 --> 00:05:42.750
And so I wanted to walk you
guys through the three sections

00:05:42.750 --> 00:05:44.740
that we're going
to touch on today.

00:05:44.740 --> 00:05:47.220
And the first one is really
that accessibility is

00:05:47.220 --> 00:05:49.308
built into Google's core DNA.

00:05:49.308 --> 00:05:50.850
And so Max is going
to take some time

00:05:50.850 --> 00:05:52.470
to walk you through
all the great work

00:05:52.470 --> 00:05:55.770
that our Android team has done
to bring accessibility directly

00:05:55.770 --> 00:05:58.017
into the platform.

00:05:58.017 --> 00:05:59.850
I'm then going to take
some time to walk you

00:05:59.850 --> 00:06:01.653
through the different
tools and resources

00:06:01.653 --> 00:06:03.570
you have at your fingertips
that you can start

00:06:03.570 --> 00:06:06.480
to take advantage of immediately
to make a more accessible app

00:06:06.480 --> 00:06:07.080
experience.

00:06:07.080 --> 00:06:09.330
And then we're both going
to talk to you a little more

00:06:09.330 --> 00:06:12.030
about the proactive
approach we at Play want

00:06:12.030 --> 00:06:15.660
to take throughout the
rest of 2018 and into 2019

00:06:15.660 --> 00:06:18.210
to ensure that accessibility
is being prioritized

00:06:18.210 --> 00:06:20.730
and is top of mind
for the ecosystem.

00:06:20.730 --> 00:06:23.420
And with that, I'm going
to hand it over to Max.

00:06:23.420 --> 00:06:24.930
MAXIM MAI: Cheers, Brandon.

00:06:24.930 --> 00:06:28.320
At Google, one of our
guiding philosophies

00:06:28.320 --> 00:06:30.870
is to organize the
world's information

00:06:30.870 --> 00:06:34.350
and make it universally
accessible and useful.

00:06:34.350 --> 00:06:37.450
Well, the Android team has
really taken the accessible

00:06:37.450 --> 00:06:38.640
part to heart.

00:06:38.640 --> 00:06:40.680
So I'm going to walk
you through just a few

00:06:40.680 --> 00:06:44.440
of the examples that make
Android more accessible.

00:06:44.440 --> 00:06:49.060
First off, out of the
250 million users with--

00:06:49.060 --> 00:06:53.260
people in the world with
visual impairments, 36 million

00:06:53.260 --> 00:06:55.390
are legally blind.

00:06:55.390 --> 00:06:59.200
These users can use technologies
such as screen readers

00:06:59.200 --> 00:07:02.650
or Braille displays to
access their Android devices.

00:07:05.280 --> 00:07:08.310
Because of these
technologies, this

00:07:08.310 --> 00:07:11.400
is how a blind user
might dim their screen

00:07:11.400 --> 00:07:14.460
to increase their
privacy but retain

00:07:14.460 --> 00:07:18.650
full usability of their phone.

00:07:18.650 --> 00:07:21.640
TalkBack, which is
Google's screen reader,

00:07:21.640 --> 00:07:25.240
will add spoken
and haptic feedback

00:07:25.240 --> 00:07:28.210
to your device to make
it usable without ever

00:07:28.210 --> 00:07:30.310
looking at the screen.

00:07:30.310 --> 00:07:32.610
In the next section, Brandon
will talk a little bit

00:07:32.610 --> 00:07:35.880
about what you can do to make
your app work really well

00:07:35.880 --> 00:07:38.250
with screen readers.

00:07:38.250 --> 00:07:42.990
Select to Speak helps the
over 200 million people

00:07:42.990 --> 00:07:47.850
who have mid to severe
vision impairments.

00:07:47.850 --> 00:07:49.980
So what you can do if
you have TalkBack--

00:07:49.980 --> 00:07:54.000
if you have Select to Speak
enabled, you touch your screen.

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:57.210
And the phone reads
back to you or describes

00:07:57.210 --> 00:08:00.200
what you have touched.

00:08:00.200 --> 00:08:05.750
As it turns out, Select to Speak
is also super useful for people

00:08:05.750 --> 00:08:10.320
who have difficulty processing
written or visual information

00:08:10.320 --> 00:08:12.170
or who have learning
disabilities.

00:08:14.690 --> 00:08:20.260
Many Android users suffer from
motor disabilities or motor

00:08:20.260 --> 00:08:21.670
impairments.

00:08:21.670 --> 00:08:26.710
So this can range from partial
to total paralysis, limited

00:08:26.710 --> 00:08:30.070
dexterity in the
hands or fingers,

00:08:30.070 --> 00:08:32.919
as well as limited mobility.

00:08:32.919 --> 00:08:36.100
There are various technologies
that help these users interact

00:08:36.100 --> 00:08:40.690
with their devices such as
keyboard access or voice

00:08:40.690 --> 00:08:45.610
control or head tracking
or eye tracking.

00:08:45.610 --> 00:08:48.650
Another technology
is Switch Access.

00:08:48.650 --> 00:08:50.840
So a switch, it's very simple.

00:08:50.840 --> 00:08:54.350
It's basically a big button that
you can press with your hand

00:08:54.350 --> 00:08:56.310
or with your head.

00:08:56.310 --> 00:08:58.125
And you can fully
control your device.

00:09:00.810 --> 00:09:03.980
Finally, I want to talk a
little bit about the Android

00:09:03.980 --> 00:09:08.910
Accessibility Menu, which
was announced at I/O.

00:09:08.910 --> 00:09:12.270
So this is designed
also with people in mind

00:09:12.270 --> 00:09:16.850
that have motor impairments.

00:09:16.850 --> 00:09:20.900
So it allows you with a
shortcut on the home screen

00:09:20.900 --> 00:09:24.800
or on any screen, it allows
you to quickly access functions

00:09:24.800 --> 00:09:27.380
like starting the
Google Assistant,

00:09:27.380 --> 00:09:31.790
opening the app switcher,
viewing your notifications,

00:09:31.790 --> 00:09:35.470
as well as taking screenshots.

00:09:35.470 --> 00:09:37.640
Now I know some of you
might know this example,

00:09:37.640 --> 00:09:39.560
but I think it's super powerful.

00:09:39.560 --> 00:09:44.830
So what I'd like you to do
is take out your phones.

00:09:44.830 --> 00:09:48.430
I'm sure all of you
have phones on you.

00:09:48.430 --> 00:09:50.200
So it's very, very simple.

00:09:50.200 --> 00:09:51.590
Don't be scared.

00:09:51.590 --> 00:09:56.860
So what I'd like you to do
is to take a screenshot.

00:09:56.860 --> 00:10:00.400
So taking a screenshot is--

00:10:00.400 --> 00:10:00.900
that work?

00:10:04.520 --> 00:10:06.560
Fairly easy--

00:10:06.560 --> 00:10:08.440
[LAUGHTER]

00:10:08.440 --> 00:10:09.830
--when you're on stage.

00:10:09.830 --> 00:10:15.770
So now try doing the same but
using only your weaker hand.

00:10:15.770 --> 00:10:18.350
So I'm going to try it.

00:10:18.350 --> 00:10:21.450
I'm probably going to fail.

00:10:21.450 --> 00:10:23.280
So it's quite difficult, OK?

00:10:23.280 --> 00:10:32.180
Wouldn't it be nice if there
were some sort of easy menu

00:10:32.180 --> 00:10:34.350
to do it and launch it.

00:10:34.350 --> 00:10:43.910
So having a disability or some
sort of accessibility need

00:10:43.910 --> 00:10:46.893
can be super, super
difficult or make

00:10:46.893 --> 00:10:48.560
using your phone
super, super difficult.

00:10:48.560 --> 00:10:51.210
So adding little tweaks
to your application

00:10:51.210 --> 00:10:55.797
or to your operating system
can make a huge difference.

00:11:01.650 --> 00:11:04.590
For a more complete
overview of all the

00:11:04.590 --> 00:11:08.400
Android Accessibility
features, I'd love you to go

00:11:08.400 --> 00:11:10.740
visit this go link
or this short link

00:11:10.740 --> 00:11:14.640
here, which will take
you to a video recording

00:11:14.640 --> 00:11:17.940
of the accessibility
session at this year's I/O.

00:11:17.940 --> 00:11:19.770
And it gives you
a great overview

00:11:19.770 --> 00:11:22.380
of all the accessibility
features built into Android

00:11:22.380 --> 00:11:25.500
and all the cool features
we're adding and launching

00:11:25.500 --> 00:11:28.700
in the not too distant future.

00:11:28.700 --> 00:11:30.940
So Brandon will now
come up and walk you

00:11:30.940 --> 00:11:33.130
through all the
tools and resources

00:11:33.130 --> 00:11:35.110
that Play and Google
has created to help you

00:11:35.110 --> 00:11:37.610
make your apps more accessible.

00:11:37.610 --> 00:11:40.210
BRANDON BARRAS: Thank you, Max.

00:11:40.210 --> 00:11:40.710
All right.

00:11:40.710 --> 00:11:43.250
So let's talk about what
you as Android developers

00:11:43.250 --> 00:11:45.170
can do to ensure that
you're taking advantage

00:11:45.170 --> 00:11:47.930
of all the great features
that Max just walked through,

00:11:47.930 --> 00:11:49.640
as well as what Play
is doing to help

00:11:49.640 --> 00:11:53.630
invest this group ensure
you're meeting this needs--

00:11:53.630 --> 00:11:56.750
meeting the needs of this
enormous user groups.

00:11:56.750 --> 00:11:59.690
So by show of hands, how
many folks in the audience

00:11:59.690 --> 00:12:04.510
have heard of the Android
Accessibility Guidelines?

00:12:04.510 --> 00:12:05.010
All right.

00:12:05.010 --> 00:12:06.500
So that's about right.

00:12:06.500 --> 00:12:10.370
So we launched the guidelines
a few years ago as a place

00:12:10.370 --> 00:12:13.400
where app developers
can access resources

00:12:13.400 --> 00:12:16.790
to help make their apps more
accessible and inclusive.

00:12:16.790 --> 00:12:18.980
And what we found when we
ran that same developer

00:12:18.980 --> 00:12:22.460
satisfaction survey is that
nearly 30% of developers

00:12:22.460 --> 00:12:25.040
told us they never even
heard of the guidelines.

00:12:25.040 --> 00:12:27.420
And only 5% said
they knew them well.

00:12:27.420 --> 00:12:30.860
So again, that's something
that we want to change today.

00:12:30.860 --> 00:12:33.950
And so as we look at the Android
Accessibility Guidelines,

00:12:33.950 --> 00:12:36.770
it's an area that provides
documentation, developer

00:12:36.770 --> 00:12:39.920
resources, and sample
code as developers

00:12:39.920 --> 00:12:43.070
look to either implement
or improve accessibility

00:12:43.070 --> 00:12:44.630
in their apps.

00:12:44.630 --> 00:12:47.090
And the great part
about this resource

00:12:47.090 --> 00:12:49.910
is it not only has the
broader documentation.

00:12:49.910 --> 00:12:52.820
But it also has a number
of best practices, things

00:12:52.820 --> 00:12:54.740
like ensuring that
you're labeling your UI

00:12:54.740 --> 00:12:58.130
elements correctly so that
your app works with things

00:12:58.130 --> 00:13:01.490
like screen readers, making
sure that you have large touch

00:13:01.490 --> 00:13:03.950
targets so that folks
with motor impairments

00:13:03.950 --> 00:13:08.270
or like me, have fumbly fingers,
can easily navigate your app,

00:13:08.270 --> 00:13:10.700
and ensuring that you're
providing proper color

00:13:10.700 --> 00:13:14.240
contrast so that users with
low vision who might be using

00:13:14.240 --> 00:13:18.778
their screens dimmed can have
the optimal viewing experience.

00:13:18.778 --> 00:13:20.570
And I think the important
part to note here

00:13:20.570 --> 00:13:22.970
is that a lot of
these updates don't

00:13:22.970 --> 00:13:27.260
necessitate code restructuring
or heavy dev resources.

00:13:27.260 --> 00:13:28.970
Rather, it's taking
a moment to think

00:13:28.970 --> 00:13:32.480
through the subtle details
of how users are interacting

00:13:32.480 --> 00:13:35.390
and using your app and ensuring
that you're providing them

00:13:35.390 --> 00:13:38.760
with that experience.

00:13:38.760 --> 00:13:41.160
And here at Google, as I hope
most folks in this audience

00:13:41.160 --> 00:13:43.080
know, we have Material Design.

00:13:43.080 --> 00:13:45.270
Material Design is
our design language

00:13:45.270 --> 00:13:47.790
which combines the
principles of good design

00:13:47.790 --> 00:13:49.500
with science and technology.

00:13:49.500 --> 00:13:52.140
And within our broader
Material Design overviews

00:13:52.140 --> 00:13:55.170
and material.io, we also
have an entire section

00:13:55.170 --> 00:13:57.300
dedicated to accessibility.

00:13:57.300 --> 00:13:59.160
And within that
section, we outline

00:13:59.160 --> 00:14:02.730
how developers can create
really clear, robust,

00:14:02.730 --> 00:14:07.410
and specific experiences so your
users can navigate and utilize

00:14:07.410 --> 00:14:10.140
the app the way that
they want to use it

00:14:10.140 --> 00:14:12.120
and the way that it's
meant to be used.

00:14:12.120 --> 00:14:14.620
So we'd encourage you to
head over to material.io

00:14:14.620 --> 00:14:18.330
and check it out.

00:14:18.330 --> 00:14:22.330
And probably the most key
and important component

00:14:22.330 --> 00:14:25.210
within this process to make
an accessible experience

00:14:25.210 --> 00:14:27.310
is testing your app.

00:14:27.310 --> 00:14:30.530
Encourage you to test,
test, test, and test again.

00:14:30.530 --> 00:14:32.500
So within the
guidelines, we've also

00:14:32.500 --> 00:14:34.360
published a getting
started guide

00:14:34.360 --> 00:14:37.300
which outlines the different
methodologies and the ways you

00:14:37.300 --> 00:14:38.200
can take--

00:14:38.200 --> 00:14:40.930
go about testing your
app's accessibility.

00:14:40.930 --> 00:14:43.480
And what we found is that
the most accessible apps

00:14:43.480 --> 00:14:45.370
have really taken
advantage of all three

00:14:45.370 --> 00:14:48.040
of these different methodologies
to ensure that nothing

00:14:48.040 --> 00:14:50.260
is missed when it
comes to the usability

00:14:50.260 --> 00:14:53.722
and accessibility of your app.

00:14:53.722 --> 00:14:55.180
And here at Google,
folks might not

00:14:55.180 --> 00:14:57.700
be aware that we also have
a first party app called

00:14:57.700 --> 00:14:59.690
the Accessibility Scanner.

00:14:59.690 --> 00:15:02.200
The Accessibility Scanner
is available to download

00:15:02.200 --> 00:15:04.540
on the Play Store and
can be used with anybody

00:15:04.540 --> 00:15:06.490
without technical background.

00:15:06.490 --> 00:15:07.960
You download the app.

00:15:07.960 --> 00:15:10.870
And it scans the
accessibility capabilities

00:15:10.870 --> 00:15:13.740
on any app you already have
downloaded on your phone.

00:15:13.740 --> 00:15:16.270
And it helps identify
things like touch target

00:15:16.270 --> 00:15:21.058
sizes, low color contrast,
content labeling, and more.

00:15:21.058 --> 00:15:22.600
And what it does is
that it gives you

00:15:22.600 --> 00:15:25.540
subtle suggestions on
how to improve that

00:15:25.540 --> 00:15:28.553
or it points you to the proper
resources to address it.

00:15:28.553 --> 00:15:30.970
So again, we encourage you to
head over to the Play Store,

00:15:30.970 --> 00:15:34.640
give it a download, and start
playing around with it today.

00:15:34.640 --> 00:15:36.830
And finally, as we talked
about earlier today,

00:15:36.830 --> 00:15:39.770
we have the pre-launch reports,
which help our developers

00:15:39.770 --> 00:15:42.500
as they upload their
APKs or their app bundles

00:15:42.500 --> 00:15:46.310
to identify a number
of different issues

00:15:46.310 --> 00:15:48.500
across a number of
different Android devices

00:15:48.500 --> 00:15:53.120
before your app goes public,
including accessibility.

00:15:53.120 --> 00:15:54.710
And since launching
accessibility

00:15:54.710 --> 00:15:57.230
in the pre-launch
reports this past July,

00:15:57.230 --> 00:15:59.960
we've helped flag
over 35 million issues

00:15:59.960 --> 00:16:02.660
across 500,000 apps.

00:16:02.660 --> 00:16:05.550
And while this seems like
a fairly large number,

00:16:05.550 --> 00:16:08.000
I think the thing to point out
here is that a lot of these

00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:10.100
are very simple fixes,
things that you're

00:16:10.100 --> 00:16:12.797
able to fix before you
publish your app publicly.

00:16:12.797 --> 00:16:14.630
And so we again encourage
you to take a look

00:16:14.630 --> 00:16:16.880
at the pre-launch reports
around accessibility

00:16:16.880 --> 00:16:19.160
to ensure you're providing
your users with the most

00:16:19.160 --> 00:16:21.410
inclusive and
accessible experience.

00:16:21.410 --> 00:16:22.910
With that, I'm going
to hand it back

00:16:22.910 --> 00:16:24.740
to Max who's going to
talk about what we're

00:16:24.740 --> 00:16:27.020
doing throughout the rest
of the year and into 2019

00:16:27.020 --> 00:16:30.230
around accessibility.

00:16:30.230 --> 00:16:31.760
MAXIM MAI: Cheers, Brandon.

00:16:31.760 --> 00:16:36.770
Some of you may be wondering,
well, this looks beneficial.

00:16:36.770 --> 00:16:44.740
But how much work is this going
to be for me or for my team?

00:16:44.740 --> 00:16:51.440
Also, how will I be able to
prioritize this on my roadmap?

00:16:51.440 --> 00:16:55.940
Well, we were thinking exactly
the same earlier this year.

00:16:55.940 --> 00:16:58.100
And we decided to take a look.

00:16:58.100 --> 00:17:01.870
So I'm going to walk
you through what

00:17:01.870 --> 00:17:04.180
we've done since this summer.

00:17:04.180 --> 00:17:07.599
In fact, we got together
with a couple of you.

00:17:07.599 --> 00:17:10.540
We got together
with 19 developers

00:17:10.540 --> 00:17:13.760
from all the global regions.

00:17:13.760 --> 00:17:17.609
And we did a Play
accessibility review pilot.

00:17:17.609 --> 00:17:19.109
And we wanted to do two things.

00:17:19.109 --> 00:17:21.470
We wanted to
understand and learn

00:17:21.470 --> 00:17:27.410
how can we review apps for
accessibility at scale.

00:17:27.410 --> 00:17:30.800
And more importantly,
we wanted to understand

00:17:30.800 --> 00:17:35.010
how difficult would
it be for developers

00:17:35.010 --> 00:17:40.050
to make fixes to make
their app more accessible.

00:17:40.050 --> 00:17:43.480
And so here are the results.

00:17:43.480 --> 00:17:46.480
Here you'll see
the top nine issues

00:17:46.480 --> 00:17:49.440
that were discovered
during the pilot.

00:17:49.440 --> 00:17:52.350
You can see the
frequency by which

00:17:52.350 --> 00:17:58.470
they were discovered on the
y-axis and the difficulty

00:17:58.470 --> 00:18:01.890
of fixing them on the x-axis.

00:18:01.890 --> 00:18:04.530
And I think the
key takeaway here

00:18:04.530 --> 00:18:11.230
is that a lot of the frequent
fixes were easily fixed.

00:18:11.230 --> 00:18:14.360
But I want to look at the
two most frequent fixes--

00:18:14.360 --> 00:18:19.470
two most frequent issues in
a little bit more detail.

00:18:19.470 --> 00:18:22.840
So let's look at
an issue that was

00:18:22.840 --> 00:18:25.790
seen in almost every
single app we reviewed

00:18:25.790 --> 00:18:28.760
during the pilot,
which is missing

00:18:28.760 --> 00:18:34.130
or ambiguous hints and labels.

00:18:34.130 --> 00:18:37.730
So imagine you're using
your phone, and you're blind

00:18:37.730 --> 00:18:39.410
or you have severe
vision impairment,

00:18:39.410 --> 00:18:43.290
and you're using
a screen reader.

00:18:43.290 --> 00:18:46.600
And focus on the
search box at the top.

00:18:46.600 --> 00:18:53.940
So the screen reader would read
this as try Beijing edit box.

00:18:53.940 --> 00:18:57.000
And if you don't have any
visual context, as a user,

00:18:57.000 --> 00:18:59.180
you would not know
that this is where

00:18:59.180 --> 00:19:03.030
you go to search for
your next destination.

00:19:03.030 --> 00:19:07.330
The fix for this is actually
super, super simple.

00:19:07.330 --> 00:19:10.050
All you would have to do is
change the hint text here

00:19:10.050 --> 00:19:14.280
and maybe call it something like
search for a place to visit.

00:19:14.280 --> 00:19:17.100
And immediately, users
of screen readers

00:19:17.100 --> 00:19:21.960
would have a much easier
time navigating your app.

00:19:21.960 --> 00:19:25.620
The really cool thing
here is that this also

00:19:25.620 --> 00:19:28.710
improves the usability
for any user of your app,

00:19:28.710 --> 00:19:31.920
not just users of screen
readers because it's clearer

00:19:31.920 --> 00:19:34.890
what you intend this box to do.

00:19:34.890 --> 00:19:39.450
By the way, we've anonymized
all of these examples because

00:19:39.450 --> 00:19:43.900
of the sensitive nature of
the accessibility topic.

00:19:43.900 --> 00:19:49.176
So these are real examples, but
you won't recognize the apps.

00:19:49.176 --> 00:19:54.910
Now the second problem, which
was the second most frequent

00:19:54.910 --> 00:19:59.950
during the pilot, is that
users of screen readers

00:19:59.950 --> 00:20:04.370
were losing context
because of the focus order

00:20:04.370 --> 00:20:08.710
with which the screen readers
are going through the apps.

00:20:08.710 --> 00:20:14.470
Now the issue here is that if
you're using linear navigation,

00:20:14.470 --> 00:20:17.470
it may result in
your focus falling

00:20:17.470 --> 00:20:23.660
on secondary actions like
Share or Save to Favorites

00:20:23.660 --> 00:20:26.930
before the focus order
comes to the main title

00:20:26.930 --> 00:20:29.750
or the main element of the card.

00:20:29.750 --> 00:20:32.050
And so as a screen
reader user, I

00:20:32.050 --> 00:20:37.300
don't know what I'm saving to
Favorites or what I'm sharing.

00:20:37.300 --> 00:20:38.200
So that's confusing.

00:20:38.200 --> 00:20:40.130
That's an issue.

00:20:40.130 --> 00:20:44.120
The fix-- we classified it,
I think, as medium to hard--

00:20:44.120 --> 00:20:50.660
is you modify the focus order
for navigating your content

00:20:50.660 --> 00:20:51.920
elements.

00:20:51.920 --> 00:20:55.070
And then you land-- the focus
lands on the main element

00:20:55.070 --> 00:20:55.730
first.

00:20:55.730 --> 00:20:58.040
And then the user can
Save to Favorites.

00:20:58.040 --> 00:20:59.660
And they'll know why
they're doing it.

00:21:04.720 --> 00:21:09.130
So one thing to think about
with accessibility fixes

00:21:09.130 --> 00:21:14.340
is how easy is it to make
the app more accessible.

00:21:14.340 --> 00:21:18.770
The other angle you could take
is well, what's my motivation?

00:21:18.770 --> 00:21:23.600
How does accessibility fit
into my company's mission?

00:21:23.600 --> 00:21:28.400
So Lyft, the ride sharing
app, the mobility app,

00:21:28.400 --> 00:21:30.170
was one of the
pilot participants.

00:21:30.170 --> 00:21:32.690
And we asked them what
is your motivation

00:21:32.690 --> 00:21:37.490
for participating in this pilot
for investing in accessibility?

00:21:37.490 --> 00:21:40.430
And the interesting answer
that we got is well,

00:21:40.430 --> 00:21:44.090
our core mission is
improving people's lives

00:21:44.090 --> 00:21:46.670
through the world's
best transportation.

00:21:46.670 --> 00:21:51.110
And we think that having
a highly accessible app

00:21:51.110 --> 00:21:53.610
is part of that mission.

00:21:53.610 --> 00:21:57.260
And so they're using that
to justify their investment

00:21:57.260 --> 00:22:00.570
and doubling down on making
their app more accessible.

00:22:00.570 --> 00:22:02.610
And I think that's a
really nice story to share.

00:22:02.610 --> 00:22:04.490
So if you're
thinking about this,

00:22:04.490 --> 00:22:06.270
think about how it
fits into your mission.

00:22:10.030 --> 00:22:16.270
Now the accessibility pilot
was a really good experience

00:22:16.270 --> 00:22:17.830
and a very good
learning experience

00:22:17.830 --> 00:22:21.700
for both us at Play as
well as for the developers

00:22:21.700 --> 00:22:23.080
that participated.

00:22:23.080 --> 00:22:27.950
But we realized that this
was just the first step.

00:22:27.950 --> 00:22:32.330
So going forward, we're
going to double down.

00:22:32.330 --> 00:22:34.210
The first thing
we're doing is we're

00:22:34.210 --> 00:22:39.700
including accessibility feedback
in all platform design reviews

00:22:39.700 --> 00:22:41.550
that Play will do.

00:22:41.550 --> 00:22:45.010
For those of you who don't
know, a platform design review

00:22:45.010 --> 00:22:48.010
is similar but more
extensive than the review

00:22:48.010 --> 00:22:51.710
we do when we feature
apps on the Store.

00:22:51.710 --> 00:22:55.210
So now, you can ask for this
and have your app reviewed

00:22:55.210 --> 00:22:56.770
for accessibility.

00:22:56.770 --> 00:22:59.230
And we'll send you
really easy to digest

00:22:59.230 --> 00:23:02.080
feedback and suggestions.

00:23:02.080 --> 00:23:05.890
The second thing we're
doing starting in 2019,

00:23:05.890 --> 00:23:08.620
we're going to provide
further opportunities

00:23:08.620 --> 00:23:13.060
for highly accessible apps to
be discovered on the Store.

00:23:13.060 --> 00:23:17.260
This may mean that when we
make editorial decisions

00:23:17.260 --> 00:23:21.070
that we look at how
accessible is this app when

00:23:21.070 --> 00:23:22.960
we decide to feature.

00:23:22.960 --> 00:23:24.670
And the other thing
that we're doing

00:23:24.670 --> 00:23:27.400
is we're investigating
how to surface

00:23:27.400 --> 00:23:31.800
highly accessible apps in
search and throughout the Store.

00:23:37.070 --> 00:23:39.920
Well, preparing
for this session,

00:23:39.920 --> 00:23:45.560
we met a bunch of very, very
amazing and dedicated people

00:23:45.560 --> 00:23:48.050
who are working on accessible.

00:23:48.050 --> 00:23:52.460
It was inspiring to see their
passion as well as the progress

00:23:52.460 --> 00:23:54.760
that they've made.

00:23:54.760 --> 00:23:57.780
So I wanted to say or we
wanted to say a big thank

00:23:57.780 --> 00:24:00.450
you, all, for joining
and taking the time

00:24:00.450 --> 00:24:04.390
to learn about this
very important topic.

00:24:04.390 --> 00:24:07.950
And if you were not working
on accessibility before or not

00:24:07.950 --> 00:24:10.410
prioritizing it,
we really, really

00:24:10.410 --> 00:24:13.455
hope that we inspired
you to take action.

00:24:15.780 --> 00:24:17.280
BRANDON BARRAS: And
I would just say

00:24:17.280 --> 00:24:19.072
if you're getting
started on accessibility,

00:24:19.072 --> 00:24:21.060
please definitely take
advantage of these two

00:24:21.060 --> 00:24:23.290
links on the screens.

00:24:23.290 --> 00:24:26.070
There's a great video
on YouTube around what's

00:24:26.070 --> 00:24:28.260
new in accessibility
on Android and then

00:24:28.260 --> 00:24:30.990
also an article that gives
an accessibility overview

00:24:30.990 --> 00:24:33.350
on developers.android.com.

00:24:33.350 --> 00:24:35.190
We'd highly suggest
taking a look.

00:24:35.190 --> 00:24:37.440
Definitely make sure you
reach out to your BD manager,

00:24:37.440 --> 00:24:39.480
your contact at Play,
for a platform design

00:24:39.480 --> 00:24:41.490
review that Max mentioned.

00:24:41.490 --> 00:24:43.710
And if you've already
invested in accessibility,

00:24:43.710 --> 00:24:44.640
please come find us.

00:24:44.640 --> 00:24:45.880
Come talk to us.

00:24:45.880 --> 00:24:48.540
We'd love to hear why
you prioritized it,

00:24:48.540 --> 00:24:50.910
any insights you can
provide, and partner

00:24:50.910 --> 00:24:53.010
to see how we can bring
that information back

00:24:53.010 --> 00:24:54.660
to the ecosystem.

00:24:54.660 --> 00:24:56.910
And if you walk away with
one thing from this session,

00:24:56.910 --> 00:24:59.070
we hope that it's not
only are you creating

00:24:59.070 --> 00:25:02.160
an experience for folks
with disabilities to have

00:25:02.160 --> 00:25:04.530
an accessible
experience, that bringing

00:25:04.530 --> 00:25:07.110
in these core
functionalities to your app

00:25:07.110 --> 00:25:10.630
will make it a better user
experience for all users.

00:25:10.630 --> 00:25:11.820
So we thank you.

00:25:11.820 --> 00:25:13.890
And I don't believe we
have time for questions,

00:25:13.890 --> 00:25:17.570
according to this
screen, unless we do.

00:25:17.570 --> 00:25:18.310
But we thank you.

00:25:18.310 --> 00:25:21.360
[APPLAUSE]
