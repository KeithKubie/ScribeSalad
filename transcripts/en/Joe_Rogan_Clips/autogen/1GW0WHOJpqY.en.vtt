you're using marijuana I don't care will
 

00:07:51.320 --> 00:07:54.280 align:start position:0%
you're using marijuana I don't care will
you<00:07:51.410><c> pans</c><00:07:51.970><c> and</c><00:07:52.970><c> perception</c><00:07:53.870><c> things</c><00:07:53.990><c> are</c><00:07:54.140><c> off</c>

00:07:57.100 --> 00:07:57.110 align:start position:0%
so I mean I would assume there's a small
 

00:07:57.110 --> 00:07:58.960 align:start position:0%
so I mean I would assume there's a small

00:08:00.320 --> 00:08:02.230 align:start position:0%
not true right who are overusing
marijuana<00:08:00.800><c> yes</c><00:08:01.040><c> and</c><00:08:01.370><c> and</c><00:08:01.820><c> that's</c><00:08:02.030><c> probably</c>

00:08:02.230 --> 00:08:02.240 align:start position:0%
marijuana yes and and that's probably
 

00:08:02.240 --> 00:08:04.840 align:start position:0%
marijuana yes and and that's probably
the<00:08:02.390><c> majority</c><00:08:02.479><c> in</c><00:08:03.020><c> fact</c><00:08:03.200><c> okay</c><00:08:03.620><c> so</c><00:08:03.680><c> so</c><00:08:04.280><c> then</c><00:08:04.460><c> you</c>

00:08:04.840 --> 00:08:04.850 align:start position:0%
the majority in fact okay so so then you
 

00:08:04.850 --> 00:08:07.630 align:start position:0%
the majority in fact okay so so then you
