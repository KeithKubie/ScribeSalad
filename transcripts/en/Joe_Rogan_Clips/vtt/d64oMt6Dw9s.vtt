00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:04.020
It does need to be now what,
what do you think is causing autism?

2
00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:08.670
And in your personal estimation,
do you think that it is a,

3
00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:13.200
that there is a rise in the factors that are causing autism?

4
00:00:13.201 --> 00:00:18.201
Or do you think that it's a rise in the understanding of these variables that

5
00:00:19.171 --> 00:00:23.010
contribute to it that you could diagnose people with in that before they were

6
00:00:23.011 --> 00:00:26.070
previously undiagnosed?
So I think most of it is that,

7
00:00:26.071 --> 00:00:28.010
that we're just diagnosing it more.

8
00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:31.680
We're including individuals in the autism category that we didn't before.

9
00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:32.401
And by the way,

10
00:00:32.401 --> 00:00:35.940
the numbers are about to go up even more because we're getting better at

11
00:00:35.941 --> 00:00:39.720
diagnosing girls and women with autism,
which is also quite interesting.

12
00:00:39.721 --> 00:00:43.020
We used to say it was 10 to one boys to girls and now we know there are a lot

13
00:00:43.021 --> 00:00:45.230
more girls and women on the autism spectrum.

14
00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:49.320
It just that they're usually more verbal and they can camouflage it better,

15
00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:51.660
but they have very high rates of Comorbidities,

16
00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:54.630
like obsessive compulsive disorder,

17
00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:57.630
attention deficit hyperactivity disorder.

18
00:00:57.990 --> 00:01:01.830
A lot of the teenage girls with eating disorders now they're finding could

19
00:01:01.831 --> 00:01:05.400
actually be on the autism spectrum.
So the numbers are about to go up again.

20
00:01:05.401 --> 00:01:06.750
I mean that's just an example.

21
00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:11.010
I mean is I guess what you're really trying to get at is that,
is it beyond that?

22
00:01:11.011 --> 00:01:11.780
Is there,

23
00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:16.020
is there a bonafide increase beyond the number of diagnoses?

24
00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:19.420
And in that one I'm still not sure about,
yeah.

25
00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:23.430
I ran an article about early onset gender dysphoria being connected to young

26
00:01:23.431 --> 00:01:25.040
girls with autism.
Right?
Yep.

27
00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:29.130
There's a disproportionate number of girls with gender dysphoria who turned out

28
00:01:29.131 --> 00:01:32.130
to be also autistic.
Right.
I've heard that as well.
Yeah,
that's actually,

29
00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:34.860
so it's really fascinating to think about now.

30
00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:37.920
Unfortunate and fascinating at the same time,
right?
There's,
there's um,

31
00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:43.230
there's a nice paper by very good environmental scientist and Phil Landrigan who

32
00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:46.800
used to be at Mount Sinai now,
I think he's at Boston College now,

33
00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:52.340
and he publishes about five or six chemicals in the environment,

34
00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:57.600
which if you're exposed to for long periods of time during early pregnancy,

35
00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:02.760
your child will be born with some features that resemble autism.

36
00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:03.660
Do you know what those chemicals,

37
00:02:03.661 --> 00:02:06.450
so I have to remember all I talk about him in the book.

38
00:02:06.451 --> 00:02:09.960
On one of them is Depakote,
valproic acid,

39
00:02:09.961 --> 00:02:14.961
which is a psychiatric medicine used as a mood stabilizer or an antidepressant.

40
00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:20.960
So prolonged use of depakote during pregnancy has been linked to something that

41
00:02:23.281 --> 00:02:27.700
resembles autism.
So that common medications,
a common medication.
Um,

42
00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:30.180
but now that we know this information,
we don't use it anymore.

43
00:02:30.181 --> 00:02:33.140
And so one of the things that I've been saying to,
you know,

44
00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:36.330
people like Bobby Kennedy and everything else,
if you really want,

45
00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:39.450
if you really think there's some environmental link to autism,

46
00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:44.370
we've got a list of at least six chemicals during early exposure in pregnancy

47
00:02:44.371 --> 00:02:48.030
that are probably causing mutations and things like that that are leading to

48
00:02:48.031 --> 00:02:52.080
autism.
Why aren't we,
why isn't anybody looking into that?
It's just crazy.
I mean,

49
00:02:52.081 --> 00:02:56.880
so all the focus on those into vaccines and it kind of sucks all the action out

50
00:02:56.881 --> 00:02:58.740
of the room so that,
you know,

51
00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:03.880
really understanding the search for autism gets delayed or in some cases doesn't

52
00:03:03.881 --> 00:03:04.960
get pursued at all.

53
00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:09.760
Or the other thing that happens in many state legislatures and things like that,

54
00:03:09.761 --> 00:03:13.060
the focus is so much about vaccines that we don't talk about.

55
00:03:13.061 --> 00:03:16.360
What autism parents really need.
I mean,
what do I need for Rachel?
We need,

56
00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:19.810
you know,
employment counseling and help.
We need mental health counseling.

57
00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:23.050
What do we do after we're gone?
Rachel right now is living with us.

58
00:03:23.051 --> 00:03:27.700
I'm s I turned 60,
my wife is 58.
What happens to us 10,

59
00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:31.390
15,
20 years from now?
There's no roadmap.
Where's the so,

60
00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:36.670
so all of that gets shunted aside because of these phony Baloney anti vaccine

61
00:03:36.671 --> 00:03:38.170
argument.
And that's why I get angry.

62
00:03:38.171 --> 00:03:43.171
That's when I start to realize these guys in addition to affecting public health

63
00:03:43.510 --> 00:03:47.640
are actually hurting autism families as well.
Well that makes sense.
I mean,

64
00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:51.750
I can completely understand why this sort upset you,
especially as a scientist.

65
00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:54.590
Now when you're talking about these,
uh,

66
00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:59.660
various chemicals that you think do contribute to or possibly cause autism,

67
00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:00.810
um,

68
00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:05.730
maybe we should really concentrate on that and publish something about this.

69
00:04:05.731 --> 00:04:06.570
Is this something that,

70
00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:09.750
is there an article that people can go to that says something about that?

71
00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:12.660
There is,
I talk about it in the book,
in the book,
and I could,

72
00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:15.170
if I opened up the book,
I could provide it for you.
Um,

73
00:04:15.210 --> 00:04:18.420
is there anything that people can read online about this without going to your

74
00:04:18.421 --> 00:04:20.240
book?
Um,
probably,
you know,

75
00:04:20.241 --> 00:04:24.200
one of the problems that we face in this country is that we put a lot of

76
00:04:24.201 --> 00:04:26.060
scientific articles behind paywalls,

77
00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:29.600
which is a real source of frustration for me.
And that's what they do that,
well,

78
00:04:29.601 --> 00:04:33.950
one of the reasons,
one of the things that I've done now is,
um,
I'm one of the,
uh,

79
00:04:34.250 --> 00:04:35.210
I founded a,

80
00:04:35.510 --> 00:04:39.590
an open access journal called the public library science neglected tropical

81
00:04:39.591 --> 00:04:42.830
diseases so that anybody with a computer,
you know,

82
00:04:43.110 --> 00:04:46.760
an Internet connection and a printer can download the articles for your charge.

83
00:04:47.210 --> 00:04:48.560
And we need more of that.
