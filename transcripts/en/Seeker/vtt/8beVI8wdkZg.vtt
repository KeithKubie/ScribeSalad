00:00:00.089 --> 00:00:04.270
Way out past Neptune, New Horizons is flying
through the attic of our solar system… where

00:00:04.270 --> 00:00:07.350
we keep all the ancient building blocks of
life and planets.

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:08.350
How do we know?

00:00:08.350 --> 00:00:14.200
Because we can see red.

00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:18.240
Hello dwarf planet fans, Ian here for DNews,
taking some time to check in on NASA’s most

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:21.850
daring space probe that’s currently digging
deep into some of the solar system’s most

00:00:21.850 --> 00:00:23.180
ancient artifacts.

00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:27.859
After launching in 2006, NASA’s New Horizons
mission took nearly a decade to reach the

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:30.820
outer solar system to fly past Pluto.

00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:34.800
Then the nuclear-powered spacecraft zipped
through Pluto's system and saw many strange

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:35.930
and wonderful things.

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:39.480
Probably the biggest shocker was Pluto has
a kind of rusty color.

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:41.250
Mars now has some competition!

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:44.840
Who would have guessed Pluto would be the
second “red planet” located in the solar

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:47.460
system’s badlands -- way out there in the
Kuiper Belt.

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:51.690
This is surprising because up until 2015,
astronomers only had a very blurry, fuzzy

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:53.810
idea about what the tiny world looked like.

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:57.360
We thought it was an icy rocky body, but there’s
so much more...

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:01.140
Data is still being beamed back to Earth from
that famous flyby and planetary scientists

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:04.229
have been blown away by the incredible discoveries
that have been made.

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:08.009
Although Pluto is located almost 40 times
further away from the sun than the Earth,

00:01:08.009 --> 00:01:13.279
it is far from being a frozen, static wasteland;
it has vast plains of slow-moving ices, wondrous

00:01:13.279 --> 00:01:17.399
mountain ranges and it even has a thin atmosphere
that appears to create wispy clouds above

00:01:17.399 --> 00:01:18.659
its surface!

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:22.560
Its system of moons ARE also rich and varied
tiny worlds in their own right.

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:24.689
It's cold, but it's not boring.

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:28.710
The reason Pluto is red, it seems, has something
to do with tholins!

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:30.919
Tholins are an organic compound.

00:01:30.919 --> 00:01:34.939
They can form the backbone of amino acids,
and while they’re not life as such, they

00:01:34.939 --> 00:01:37.209
are certainly organic molecules!

00:01:37.209 --> 00:01:40.319
Scientists think that the tholins on Pluto’s
surface are formed when ultraviolet light

00:01:40.319 --> 00:01:44.729
from the sun breaks down methane and nitrogen
in the dwarf planet’s thin atmosphere.

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:48.399
These tholins then rained down turning its
surface a browny red.

00:01:48.399 --> 00:01:51.869
From an astrobiology standpoint, tholins are
really interesting as they are a critical

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:53.579
ingredient for life as we know it.

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:57.919
And the fact New Horizons has found Pluto
is covered in the stuff underscores the surprisingly

00:01:57.919 --> 00:02:01.609
active atmospheric chemistry that’s going
on super far away from the sun.

00:02:01.609 --> 00:02:04.029
No one really expected this stuff to happen
on Pluto!

00:02:04.029 --> 00:02:07.799
The more you think about it, the more confusing
it can get, because tholins can't form in

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:08.799
Earth's atmosphere.

00:02:08.799 --> 00:02:12.950
Instead, we may have had tholins delivered
to us by comets and asteroids, possibly forming

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:15.829
the backbone of life here billions of years
ago.

00:02:15.829 --> 00:02:19.209
So even though New Horizons already flew by
Pluto, there's a lot more to learn.

00:02:19.209 --> 00:02:23.280
It’s now on track to make an EVEN CLOSER
flyby of another object deep in the Kuiper

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:25.200
Belt called 2014 MU69.

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:28.829
And, MU69 is even redder than Pluto!

00:02:28.829 --> 00:02:32.099
Scientists will be absolutely checking to
see if its redness is also caused by the presence

00:02:32.099 --> 00:02:33.099
of tholins.

00:02:33.099 --> 00:02:37.390
MU69 is ancient, and has occupied the Kuiper
Belt since the dawn of the solar system.

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:41.480
If this little frozen red rock is also covered
in tholins, then it too may have these building

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:42.739
blocks for life.

00:02:42.739 --> 00:02:43.969
But what does that mean?

00:02:43.969 --> 00:02:47.569
We talked to the New Horizons team and they
said we won't know until we get there.

00:02:47.569 --> 00:02:51.430
We are truly at the raggedy edge of science
discovery, where a robotic probe is pushing

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:55.610
deep into the unexplored Kuiper belt and also
deep into the ancient history of our solar

00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:56.610
system.

00:02:56.610 --> 00:02:59.550
Life on Earth may have come from space, but
how did THAT work?

00:02:59.550 --> 00:03:03.689
Check out my recent video about comets carrying
the chemistry of life and a cool planet-hopping

00:03:03.689 --> 00:03:05.989
life hypothesis called panspermia!

00:03:05.989 --> 00:03:09.620
Should these impacts have been powerful enough,
chunks of Earth's crust would've been kicked

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:10.939
into space.

00:03:10.939 --> 00:03:14.700
As the planet is covered in life, some of
these chunks of Earth rock would've likely

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:16.470
had bacteria hitching a ride.

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:17.959
What other secrets do you think Pluto's hiding?
