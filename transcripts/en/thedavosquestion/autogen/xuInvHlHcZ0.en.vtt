the criteria that we would want to
 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:43.910
the criteria that we would want to
choose before we present to the rest of

sustainable and connected and smart
urban infrastructure so one of those

00:00:55.189 --> 00:00:55.199
urban infrastructure so one of those
 

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:57.950

private partnership it's not simply an

00:00:59.810 --> 00:00:59.820
private partnership it's not simply an
 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:01.760
private partnership it's not simply an
initiative of government or industry but

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:01.770
initiative of government or industry but
 

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:03.889
initiative of government or industry but
it's a combination of the resources and

00:01:03.889 --> 00:01:03.899
it's a combination of the resources and
 

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:06.200
it's a combination of the resources and
wisdom of both another is that there's

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:06.210
wisdom of both another is that there's
 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:09.260
wisdom of both another is that there's
deep public participation third is that

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:09.270
deep public participation third is that
 

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:12.789
deep public participation third is that
there's a environmental impact which is

00:01:12.789 --> 00:01:12.799
there's a environmental impact which is
 

00:01:12.799 --> 00:01:16.160
there's a environmental impact which is
positive impact where resources are

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:16.170
positive impact where resources are
 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:18.740
positive impact where resources are
scarce and therefore preserved and

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:18.750
scarce and therefore preserved and
 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:20.539
scarce and therefore preserved and
conserved so those are some of the

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:20.549
conserved so those are some of the
 

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:22.190
conserved so those are some of the
criteria that we're talking about and

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:22.200
criteria that we're talking about and
 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:24.050
criteria that we're talking about and
since I'm with Cisco of course we're

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:24.060
since I'm with Cisco of course we're
 

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:25.490
since I'm with Cisco of course we're
talking about the underlying digital

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:25.500
talking about the underlying digital
 

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:27.770

provides the capacity for a city to

00:01:29.569 --> 00:01:29.579
provides the capacity for a city to
 

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:31.190
provides the capacity for a city to
develop smart and connected

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.200
develop smart and connected
 

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:33.319
develop smart and connected
infrastructure so that's a bit of a

00:01:33.319 --> 00:01:33.329
infrastructure so that's a bit of a
 

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:35.390
infrastructure so that's a bit of a
snapshot of what we're doing and now I'm

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:35.400
snapshot of what we're doing and now I'm
