00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.000
The answer is that E has to be 1 because E is the carry digit.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:11.000
After adding up these two 3-digit numbers we get a little bit more,

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.000
and the most that the carry digit could be is a 1.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:21.000
If O stood for 9, even 9 plus 9 is 18, and we might carry over a little bit.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.000
But still that's 19. It's not 28.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.000
So the E must be a 1.

00:00:26.000 --> 09:59:59.000
We could go on from there and figure other things.
