00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.580
Hungry for some pizza?

00:00:01.580 --> 00:00:05.000
We all like a good pizza pie to chow down on, but it turns out

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:09.340
there's a simple scientific solution
to maximize your pizza experience.

00:00:09.340 --> 00:00:13.400
It all comes down to the area of a circle - that equation you may have heard of when you were young,

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:17.060
where the area is equal to pi*rÂ².

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:18.220
"r" being the radius.

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:21.380
If we plug in some numbers, you may notice something interesting.

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:24.760
For example, since we measure pizza in inches in North America,

00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:29.099
the area of an 8 inch pizza is roughly 50 square inches.

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:32.239
We simply take the radius of the pizza
which is half of the diameter,

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:35.880
so 4 inches in this case, put it in the equation
and voila.

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:39.760
But if we do the same thing for a
16-inch pizza,

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:42.440
which has a diameter that is two times bigger,

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:46.170
we find that, even though your intuition
may say it's twice as big,

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:52.320
it actually has an area of over 200
square inches. Which is four times more pizza.

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:55.660
This is because the area of a circle
increases with the square of the radius.

00:00:55.660 --> 00:01:01.900
And yet most of the time, the difference in
price between an 8-inch pizza and a 16-inch pizza

00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:06.740
is not even two times more
expensive - let alone four times more expensive.

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:13.480
In fact, NPR did a study of
over 74,000 pizza prices in America and created an interactive graph

00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:16.540
to show exactly how the price of pizza changes with size

00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:19.940
and how much more pizza you
get when you order a large.

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:23.720
For example, a 20 inch pizza has more area than

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:26.850
two 14 inch pizzas or six 8 inch pizzas.

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:31.420
Yet it's almost nine dollars cheaper on
average than getting to 14 inch pizzas

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:36.350
and over thirty dollars cheaper on
average than getting six 8 inch pizzas.

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:38.840
And this is the pizza equation:

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:41.990
The bigger the diameter of the pizza the
more bang for your buck.

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:45.829
But why is pizza so tasty in the first
place?

00:01:45.829 --> 00:01:50.500
We actually break down the science
behind why pizza is the perfect food on AsapTHOUGHT

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:53.040
all while making some delicious recipes.
