00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:04.000
Let's dive in a little deeper into this whole concept of edges.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.010
But let's now look at images and derivatives of images.

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:12.950
So I'd like to define an edge basically as a point in an image, pixel or

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:18.560
group of pixel but there is a rapid change in the im, image intensity function.

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:22.200
So basically again we want to look at, the image intensities, at a three

00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:26.850
pixel value, in a discrete form or in a function across the function itself.

00:00:26.850 --> 00:00:29.230
And look for where there is any kind of rapid change.

00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:30.420
Significant change.

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:34.730
Again the rapid change will somewhere where the threshold value will come in.

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:38.670
Small gradual change will be a few pixels, but also not just looking at

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:42.700
how one pixel to the other but a significant size of the neighborhood.

00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:45.530
Just to keep things simple we're going to look at just the one

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:46.870
slice through this image.

00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:49.210
This is a sample image that we will play with here.

00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:51.170
And if I was to just construct of course,

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:55.400
the slice of this intensity, I would get this.

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:59.360
So in essence, as I traverse through an image, the intensity is high.

00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:01.410
Where this grey values are.

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:05.870
Goes down to a little whole number but it's darker and then comes back up.

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:08.950
So this is basically, on this slice is the intensity map.

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:12.330
Here's what we want to do to this now data here, this the intensity map.

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:16.090
We want to actually just do a simple difference operation on it.

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:18.430
That is I want to take, for example, this value and

00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:21.020
difference it from the next one coming after it.

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:22.800
And then similarly I want to basically each and

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:26.140
every value, I want to difference it from the previous one.

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:30.650
This is basically a simple first derivative by just doing simple differences.

00:01:30.650 --> 00:01:33.550
And if you look at this, and actually if you look at this kind of stuff here

00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:38.200
too, there is of course no changes here, and all of a sudden, many comes here.

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:40.740
There is a significant change.

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:43.230
This would of course when you look at it in difference form,

00:01:43.230 --> 00:01:45.170
would give you this change of course.

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:50.380
When it gets here, it basically goes back to zero again, no change.

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:52.170
Another way to look at it, this would be for

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:55.210
example the slope of this line, the slope of this line is zero.

00:01:55.210 --> 00:02:01.030
All of a sudden the slope goes from zero to a larger number and

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:02.920
then of course goes back to zero again.

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:06.280
So when you notice here, goes to larger number, goes back to zero.

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:11.895
Similarly when we come back to here, it's this way and again the slope changes.

00:02:11.895 --> 00:02:14.520
End of this line again, comes back to zero.

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:16.760
So if you notice this is an interesting phenomenon,

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:18.670
that we will actually now capture.

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:22.540
This point here is basically an output of information that

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:25.440
cames from this region here.

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:30.260
And this region here was captured by this point.

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:37.250
So if you notice now, is, these extrema points refer to this edge, and

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:39.835
this extrema point refers to this edge.

00:02:39.835 --> 00:02:44.470
We'll only look for derivatives in x, and these are the two edges.

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:46.015
But there's a rapid change.

00:02:46.015 --> 00:02:49.090
As I traverse this way on the image.

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:51.392
Of course, using this now edges,

00:02:51.392 --> 00:02:54.820
we would be able to find something that would always be similar.

00:02:54.820 --> 00:02:58.515
Even if I actually took the image of this one slightly moved around to

00:02:58.515 --> 00:03:01.120
a next part, or if this was translated in some way.
