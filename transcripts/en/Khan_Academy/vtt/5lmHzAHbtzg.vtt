00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:03.470
Let's say that both Ben's
Shoes and Jason's Shoes

00:00:03.470 --> 00:00:05.400
are publicly traded companies.

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:08.530
And all that means is
that both of their shares

00:00:08.530 --> 00:00:10.250
are traded on exchanges.

00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:12.950
Maybe it's the NASDAQ, or
the New York Stock Exchange,

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:14.410
or some other exchange.

00:00:14.410 --> 00:00:17.580
And the going price
on those exchanges--

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:22.820
the last closing price for Ben's
stock was $21.50 per share,

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:27.170
and the last closing price for
Jason's stock is $12.00 per

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:27.670
share.

00:00:27.670 --> 00:00:28.900
What I want to
explore in this video,

00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:30.410
and probably the
next few is, what

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:32.890
is that saying for
what the market thinks

00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:35.090
these businesses are worth?

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:38.760
So in both of these situations,
they have 10,000 shares.

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:42.220
And remember, the shares are
a split of the owner's equity.

00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:43.780
It's not a split of the assets.

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:47.480
It's a split of just the
equity part, right over here.

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:50.980
So if shareholders are
willing to pay 21.50 per share

00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:55.670
for Ben's stock, and there are
10,000 shares in Ben's company.

00:00:55.670 --> 00:01:00.640
So you take 21.50 times--
I'll do it this way--

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:07.870
times 10,000 shares
gives us a market cap.

00:01:07.870 --> 00:01:20.480
So 21.50 times 10,000
gives us $215,000.

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:25.030
And what this says is, look,
if each of those 10,000 slices

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:29.060
of the equity is worth 21.50,
then the entire equity portion

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:34.240
is going to be-- the market
is valuing it at $215,000.

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:36.280
And this calculation,
this multiplication

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:39.350
of the market price per share
times the number of shares,

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:43.140
this is called the market cap.

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:45.440
Short for market capitalization.

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:47.090
The market cap of the company.

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:49.850
And all it is, is
what is the market

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:53.570
valuing the equity part
of Ben's company worth?

00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:55.660
Let's do the same thing
for Jason's company.

00:01:55.660 --> 00:02:07.560
You have $12.00 per share
times 10,000 shares.

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:12.190
That gives us
$120,000 market cap.

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:16.780
So the market is telling us
that even though on the books,

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:20.280
Ben's equity-- based on
how he valued his assets

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:22.640
and his liabilities--
is 135,000.

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:26.574
The market is actually
valuing this at 215,000.

00:02:26.574 --> 00:02:27.990
And in the next
video, we'll think

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:30.156
about what that means for
how the market is actually

00:02:30.156 --> 00:02:31.310
valuing the business.

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:36.770
In the case of Jason's business,
instead of $35,000 of equity--

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:39.370
just straight up from
what's on the books--

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:45.221
the market is valuing this
piece right here at $120,000.

00:02:45.221 --> 00:02:46.970
So hopefully that gives
you a little sense

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:49.850
of one, what shares
are a share of.

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:52.770
They're a share of the owner's
equity, not of the assets.

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:56.000
And also gives you a good
sense of what market cap is.

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:59.850
It's the market's value
of the owner's equity.

00:02:59.850 --> 00:03:01.530
And notice, in both
cases-- and it's

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:03.170
usually the case--
it's going to be

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:06.230
a different number than the
book value, the number that's

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:08.741
actually on the books.
