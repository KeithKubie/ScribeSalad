00:00:00.580 --> 00:00:02.680
On the number line
below, which point

00:00:02.680 --> 00:00:06.895
more closely represents
the principal root of 43?

00:00:06.895 --> 00:00:10.195
Or you could view it as the
positive square root of 43.

00:00:10.195 --> 00:00:11.820
And I encourage you
to pause this video

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:14.484
and, just looking at this,
try to approximate where A is

00:00:14.484 --> 00:00:15.607
and where B is.

00:00:15.607 --> 00:00:17.440
And let's think about
which of those numbers

00:00:17.440 --> 00:00:22.256
is closer to the
principal root of 43.

00:00:22.256 --> 00:00:23.630
So let's go through
each of them.

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:26.750
So point A right over there--
it looks a little bit more

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:31.100
than halfway along the
way between 6.5 and 6.6.

00:00:31.100 --> 00:00:34.950
Halfway looks like
it's right over there,

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:37.470
so that would be 6.55.

00:00:37.470 --> 00:00:41.010
So I would estimate A to
be approximately-- A looks

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:48.420
like it's approximately 6.56.

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:53.760
So let's square that and see
what we get-- so 6.56 times

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:55.330
6.56.

00:00:55.330 --> 00:00:57.080
And obviously, if
you had a calculator,

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:59.240
you could just punch the
square root of 43 in,

00:00:59.240 --> 00:01:00.950
but we don't want to do that.

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:03.690
Or this exercise doesn't
want us to do that,

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:06.220
so I'm not going to use
a calculator for it.

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:08.500
So 6 times 6 is 36.

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:13.210
6 times 5 is 30, plus 3 is 33.

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:17.490
6 times 6 is 36, plus 3 is 39.

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:20.290
Now, you'd think about this 5.

00:01:20.290 --> 00:01:21.850
So let's throw a 0 here.

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:23.663
5 times 6 is 30.

00:01:23.663 --> 00:01:25.010
Put a 3 up there.

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:29.530
5 times 5 is 25, plus 3 is 28.

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:33.580
5 times 6 is 30, plus 2 is 32.

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:35.880
And then we've got
another 6 here.

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:38.520
Well, we already figured
out what 6 times 6.65 is.

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:41.400
It's 3,936, so let's
throw our two 0's here.

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:45.460
And we're going to have
a 6, a 3, a 9, and a 3.

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:50.480
And now we can add everything
together, and we get 6,

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:52.000
3-- let's see.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:57.577
9 plus 8 is 17, plus 6 is 23.

00:01:57.577 --> 00:01:58.160
And let's see.

00:01:58.160 --> 00:02:01.380
2 plus 3 is 5.

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:03.205
Another 5, you get 10.

00:02:03.205 --> 00:02:03.990
And let's see.

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:07.020
This is 13, so you get 4.

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:07.520
Let's see.

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:09.280
And you have one,
two, three, four

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:11.980
numbers behind the decimal.

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:16.040
So this gets us to 43.0336.

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:18.093
So this is pretty close to 43.

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:24.700
Without even thinking
about what B squared is,

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:26.460
I'm already
predisposed to saying

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:28.980
that A is going to be
closer, but let's just try.

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:30.650
Let's just think
about where B is.

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:35.900
Actually, we don't even have to
look at B. Because A is pretty

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:39.240
close, and A squared
is already larger.

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:40.090
Let me write this.

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:44.670
So A squared, if we approximated
it right, at 6.56-- so

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:53.070
let me write this down--
squared, which is 43.0336,

00:02:53.070 --> 00:02:57.750
is already greater than 43.

00:02:57.750 --> 00:03:01.260
Or another way of
saying it, 6.56

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:06.390
is already greater than
the principal root of 43.

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:10.270
So A looks like it's
already-- it's pretty close.

00:03:10.270 --> 00:03:12.050
If anything, it's
a little bit larger

00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:13.660
than the square root of 43.

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:17.410
So B is going to be that
much-- B is larger than A.

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:19.690
So B is going to get
us even further above.

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:22.580
If we square B, we're going
to get even further above 43.

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:26.300
So we can rule out B, and that
saves us a lot of computation.

00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:28.030
And so we're going
to go with A. A is

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:34.933
a pretty good approximation
of the square root of 43.
