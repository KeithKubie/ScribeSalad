00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:02.500
A couple of weeks ago, I talked
about a strategy for reproduction

00:00:02.500 --> 00:00:05.450
that the very first plants came
up with, called alternation of

00:00:05.450 --> 00:00:09.350
generations, a strategy that
nonvascular plants still use today.

00:00:09.350 --> 00:00:11.170
Hopefully this is
coming back to you.

00:00:11.170 --> 00:00:12.960
A plant can take two
different forms that

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:15.000
alternate back and
forth between generations.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:16.759
The first form, the sporophyte,

00:00:16.759 --> 00:00:19.089
has diploid cells,
two sets of chromosomes.

00:00:19.089 --> 00:00:21.210
And the second form,
the gametophyte,

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:23.439
has haploid cells,
just one set of chromosomes.

00:00:23.439 --> 00:00:26.279
Well, a lot can happen
in 470 million years.

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:29.849
Today, vascular plants still use
the basic alternation of generations

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:33.050
model, but they've tricked it
out so that it works a whole

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:35.430
lot different than it did
back in the Ordovician swamps

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:36.859
where planthood got its start.

00:00:36.859 --> 00:00:39.480
Compared with their small,
damp nonvascular brethren,

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:41.750
vascular plants, with all their
cones and flowers and other

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:44.230
flashy accessories, look like a
bunch of drag queens at a

00:00:44.230 --> 00:00:46.510
Carmen Miranda conference
and samba dance-off.

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:49.920
Which might seem like overkill,
but we rely on these crazy kooks

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:52.500
and their upstart
reproductive strategies for...

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:55.300
well, pretty much for our
everything: the food we eat,

00:00:55.300 --> 00:00:58.129
the air we breathe, the bouquets
that we send to our wives

00:00:58.129 --> 00:01:00.559
and girlfriends when
they're mad at us.

00:01:00.559 --> 00:01:02.699
Basically, what I'm saying,
is that we need

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:05.920
vascular plants to have sex.

00:01:07.759 --> 00:01:14.759
So, as you recall, the
alternation of generations

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:18.619
in nonvascular plants
is pretty straightforward.

00:01:18.619 --> 00:01:22.790
A gametophyte produces either
sperm or eggs which find each other

00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:25.210
if it's wet enough for the sperm
to swim to the nearest egg.

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:28.399
Once the egg is fertilized, the
gametophyte creates the sporophyte,

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:31.500
which is a little capsule on a stalk
that has a bunch of spores in it.

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:35.119
The spores are released into the
air, they land in a moist place,

00:01:35.119 --> 00:01:38.450
germinate, and BAM! A new
gametophyte generation is born.

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:42.070
But nonvascular plants are what
you call gametophyte dominant:

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:44.719
What you're looking at when you
look at a moss or a hornwort

00:01:44.719 --> 00:01:46.500
or a liverwort is the gametophyte.

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:49.509
It's the form that has
only one set of chromosomes.

00:01:49.509 --> 00:01:52.759
For them, the sporophytes are
tiny and tucked away inside the

00:01:52.759 --> 00:01:55.430
gametophytes, which they rely
on for food, water, and protection.

00:01:55.430 --> 00:01:57.609
But in vascular plants,
it's the opposite.

00:01:57.609 --> 00:01:58.710
They're sporophyte dominant.

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:01.250
When you look at a fern or a pine
tree or a morning glory, you're

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:04.060
looking at the sporophyte
generation, and the gametophytes

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:06.320
are the teeny, tiny sex-making

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:08.569
materials is has stashed
away in special parts.

00:02:08.569 --> 00:02:10.819
So, yes, all vascular
plants are sporophyte dominant,

00:02:10.819 --> 00:02:14.470
but that doesn't mean they all
reproduce in the same way. No sir!

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:16.819
The simplest form of
vascular plant are the ferns,

00:02:16.819 --> 00:02:18.800
which reproduce a lot
like nonvascular plants,

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:21.959
in that they have spores that
grow on the underside of the frond,

00:02:21.959 --> 00:02:25.160
or fern leaf, which are released
into the wild blue yonder

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:27.980
to find a nice soggy patch
of ground to germinate on.

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:30.849
The spore then makes a tiny
gametophyte, which is only a few

00:02:30.849 --> 00:02:33.849
centimeters wide and has both
male and female reproductive organs

00:02:33.849 --> 00:02:35.060
on the underside of its leaves.

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:37.440
If it's moist enough, the sperm
on the boy side of the gametophyte

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:41.590
will find the egg on the girl side,
and it will create a sporophyte,

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:43.459
which is what we recognize as a fern.

00:02:43.459 --> 00:02:46.349
There's a lot of fossil evidence
to suggest that at one point,

00:02:46.349 --> 00:02:48.510
there probably were ferns
that produced seeds,

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:50.610
and that all the fancypants
vascular plants that

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:53.580
do have seeds and flowers
evolved from them.

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:56.550
But those seed-bearing
ferns are all extinct now,

00:02:56.550 --> 00:02:59.069
so we can just gaze longingly
at their fossils and wonder

00:02:59.069 --> 00:03:01.540
what their alternation of
generations looked like.

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:04.120
But there are other groups of
plants that are more complex

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:07.709
than ferns, and what they all have
in common is that they reproduce

00:03:07.709 --> 00:03:11.420
by creating pollen, which
contains the male gametophyte,

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:12.700
and the female gametophytes,

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:15.220
or ovules, which are
fertilized by the pollen.

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:18.209
The complete, fertilized
cell grows into a seed,

00:03:18.209 --> 00:03:21.159
which ripens and can
produce a complete adult plant.

00:03:21.159 --> 00:03:24.040
So, reiterating: In your
more advanced vascular plants,

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:26.099
that's how the alternation
of generations works.

00:03:26.099 --> 00:03:28.980
The sporophyte generation
grows from a seed and produces

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:31.780
tiny gametophytes,
either pollen or ovules.

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:33.900
They then combine
to form another seed,

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:35.530
which produces another sporophyte.

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:38.620
This evolutionary change from
spores to seeds was a big deal,

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:41.430
and it began with the gymnosperms.

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:44.860
Their single-serving plant-making
packages cut out the middleman

00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:47.709
by allowing an adult plant to
grow immediately from a seed

00:03:47.709 --> 00:03:49.409
rather than having to
wait for a spore to go

00:03:49.409 --> 00:03:51.560
through that intermediate
gametophyte stage.

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:53.790
It also means, in most cases,
that there doesn't have to be

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:55.810
water present in order to reproduce.

00:03:55.810 --> 00:03:58.970
Today gymnosperms include
conifers, gingkos, and tropical,

00:03:58.970 --> 00:04:02.439
palm-like plants called cycads,
and none of them produce flowers

00:04:02.439 --> 00:04:04.799
because they evolved before
flowers were invented.

00:04:04.799 --> 00:04:06.959
Instead, their reproductive
structures are cones.

00:04:06.959 --> 00:04:08.890
And you've seen a few
of these in your day.

00:04:08.890 --> 00:04:11.230
In fact, their name,
gymnosperm, means "naked seed,"

00:04:11.230 --> 00:04:13.730
and that comes from the fact
that their ovules develop

00:04:13.730 --> 00:04:16.460
exposed on the surface
of their cone scales.

00:04:16.460 --> 00:04:18.260
What we think of as cones
are the spiky, woody things

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:20.920
that Boy Scouts are throwing
at each other at camp, right?

00:04:20.920 --> 00:04:23.840
But those things are actually
female cones, which house the ovules.

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:27.310
The male cones are smaller and
kind of spongy and their job

00:04:27.310 --> 00:04:28.920
is to crank out pollen.

00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:30.830
All this pollen is
carried on the wind,

00:04:30.830 --> 00:04:33.140
and some of it might find
its way to a female cone,

00:04:33.140 --> 00:04:36.080
where it fertilizes the ovule,
located at the base of each

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:37.750
of the scales of the female cone.

00:04:37.750 --> 00:04:40.640
As the fertilized embryo
matures inside the cone,

00:04:40.640 --> 00:04:43.220
it makes a seed containing
enough nutrients to sustain

00:04:43.220 --> 00:04:44.870
it for a while after it germinates.

00:04:44.870 --> 00:04:48.010
This seed has a tough, shiny casing
to protect it from the elements,

00:04:48.010 --> 00:04:51.880
and once it's mature, the scales
of the female cone just peel back,

00:04:51.880 --> 00:04:54.090
and the seed falls to the
ground and makes a new tree!

00:04:54.090 --> 00:04:56.800
But some gymnosperms have evolved
the need for special conditions

00:04:56.800 --> 00:04:58.970
in order to reproduce.
Take the Lodgepole Pine.

00:04:58.970 --> 00:05:01.750
It's a super tough tree that
evolved in a pretty dry climate

00:05:01.750 --> 00:05:04.510
where there's lots of lightning
storms that regularly start fires

00:05:04.510 --> 00:05:06.430
that burn through a
forest every few years.

00:05:06.430 --> 00:05:08.720
Not only do Lodgepoles have no
problem withstanding a good

00:05:08.720 --> 00:05:12.540
low-intensity forest fire,
their female cones are serotinous,

00:05:12.540 --> 00:05:14.880
so they will only open
and drop their seeds

00:05:14.880 --> 00:05:16.570
when exposed to extreme heat.

00:05:16.570 --> 00:05:19.080
Now this sounds kind of crazy,
but really it's super smart:

00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:22.760
because the Lodgepoles have evolved
to take advantage of forest fires.

00:05:22.760 --> 00:05:25.470
They know that the forest fire will
probably get rid of a lot of

00:05:25.470 --> 00:05:28.320
pesky underbrush that would crowd
out their babies, and maybe even

00:05:28.320 --> 00:05:30.880
it would kill some adult lodgepole
pines, so they just wait for

00:05:30.880 --> 00:05:33.720
the competition to be removed
before they expose their seeds.

00:05:33.720 --> 00:05:37.310
So, now I'm fixin' to pull out
the big guns: the angiosperms.

00:05:37.310 --> 00:05:41.160
Because angiosperms are the
winners of the All-Invitational

00:05:41.160 --> 00:05:43.410
Plant Division of Things
That Live On Earth,

00:05:43.410 --> 00:05:45.710
at least for the past
140 million years or so.

00:05:45.710 --> 00:05:47.820
They're rookies, really, but they
know what they're doing.

00:05:47.820 --> 00:05:50.290
For starters, they have
seeds like gymnosperms,

00:05:50.290 --> 00:05:52.400
but they also have flowers.

00:05:52.400 --> 00:05:54.890
And flowers are awesome because
they don't have to rely

00:05:54.890 --> 00:05:57.560
on the wind to carry their
pollen to another flower

00:05:57.560 --> 00:05:59.450
like gymnosperms do
with their cones.

00:05:59.450 --> 00:06:02.180
For the most part, flowers
put animals to work,

00:06:02.180 --> 00:06:04.350
toting their pollen from
one flower to another.

00:06:04.350 --> 00:06:07.460
In fact, angiosperms and flying
insects probably evolved together,

00:06:07.460 --> 00:06:10.170
or co-evolved, the flowers
providing food for the insects

00:06:10.170 --> 00:06:13.020
in the form of nectar, and the
insects providing transportation

00:06:13.020 --> 00:06:15.940
for the pollen to another flower's
female reproductive parts.

00:06:15.940 --> 00:06:18.930
This, my friends,
is what we call mutualism,

00:06:18.930 --> 00:06:23.000
the interaction of two organisms
which mutually benefits both.

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:25.920
Angiosperms reproduce by making
flowers that contain the gametophytes.

00:06:25.920 --> 00:06:28.610
In this case, the sporophyte
is made up of the stem,

00:06:28.610 --> 00:06:30.650
the roots, leaves
and even the flowers,

00:06:30.650 --> 00:06:34.470
all of the other parts of the plant
except the pollen and the ovum,

00:06:34.470 --> 00:06:35.880
which are the actual gametophytes.

00:06:35.880 --> 00:06:38.760
Some flowers contain both
male and female gametophytes.

00:06:38.760 --> 00:06:41.400
These are called perfect flowers.
No pressure, other flowers!

00:06:41.400 --> 00:06:43.330
Other flowers have both
male and female sex organs

00:06:43.330 --> 00:06:45.600
on the same plant,
but in different flowers.

00:06:45.600 --> 00:06:49.130
And some have male and female
flowers on entirely different plants.

00:06:49.130 --> 00:06:51.720
There are no rules with angiosperms.
They're just wingin' it.

00:06:51.720 --> 00:06:55.210
To see how flowers work, let's
take a look at a perfect flower

00:06:55.210 --> 00:06:57.930
as our example, because a lot
of the garden flowers you see

00:06:57.930 --> 00:07:00.270
have both male and
female reproductive parts.

00:07:00.270 --> 00:07:02.310
Starting from the bottom up,
a flower has sepals,

00:07:02.310 --> 00:07:05.960
which look like leaves or petals,
but they're usually green tissue

00:07:05.960 --> 00:07:07.980
that covered the flower
when it was a little bud.

00:07:07.980 --> 00:07:10.710
The petals are usually colored to
attract a certain kind of

00:07:10.710 --> 00:07:11.760
pollinator, like a flag.

00:07:11.760 --> 00:07:15.560
The male parts of flowers
consist of an anther,

00:07:15.560 --> 00:07:18.440
which produces the pollen and sits
on the end of a long filament

00:07:18.440 --> 00:07:19.810
attached to the base of the flower.

00:07:19.810 --> 00:07:22.410
This whole male reproductive set
up like this is called the stamen.

00:07:22.410 --> 00:07:26.250
Now, when it comes to ladyparts,
in contrast to gymnosperms,

00:07:26.250 --> 00:07:28.880
angiosperms don't leave their
eggs hanging out all exposed.

00:07:28.880 --> 00:07:32.210
They lock their ovules down
in an ovary at the bottom

00:07:32.210 --> 00:07:36.190
of a vase-like structure, which
also has a neck called a style,

00:07:36.190 --> 00:07:38.460
and an opening at the
top called the stigma.

00:07:38.460 --> 00:07:40.570
Now all that's left is
to get the male gametes,

00:07:40.570 --> 00:07:43.470
packaged up in their gametophyte,
the pollen, and have them carried

00:07:43.470 --> 00:07:46.710
to the female gametophyte,
the ovule, to fertilize them.

00:07:46.710 --> 00:07:50.790
This is pollination, and flowers do
it by luring animals with smells,

00:07:50.790 --> 00:07:54.160
colors, and food, and in return,
the animals mix and match

00:07:54.160 --> 00:07:56.580
the pollen with
different individual flowers.

00:07:56.580 --> 00:07:59.110
Bees are the most
famously successful at this,

00:07:59.110 --> 00:08:00.840
but lots of other
insects do it too,

00:08:00.840 --> 00:08:03.140
as well as birds like hummingbirds,
and even some bats.

00:08:03.140 --> 00:08:05.740
So, no matter who does it,
after fertilization happens,

00:08:05.740 --> 00:08:09.650
the ovule starts to swell, and the
ovule wall starts to toughen up

00:08:09.650 --> 00:08:11.910
because it's going to become a seed.

00:08:11.910 --> 00:08:15.060
The ovary, meanwhile, starts to
grow around it, and become the fruit.

00:08:15.060 --> 00:08:17.600
Now, there are a bunch
of different types of fruit.

00:08:17.600 --> 00:08:19.850
A fruit is defined as
anything that the ovary,

00:08:19.850 --> 00:08:22.160
the protection around
the seed, turns into.

00:08:22.160 --> 00:08:24.480
So anything that contains
a seed is a fruit.

00:08:24.480 --> 00:08:27.040
And that's a lot of different
things, including many,

00:08:27.040 --> 00:08:29.570
many things that we think
of as...not a fruit.

00:08:29.570 --> 00:08:31.960
To test your fruit skills,
how about a round of:

00:08:31.960 --> 00:08:33.550
Fruit and Not a Fruit!

00:08:33.550 --> 00:08:35.990
So, which one of these is the
Fruit and which one of them

00:08:35.990 --> 00:08:37.310
is the Not a Fruit?

00:08:37.310 --> 00:08:41.080
1. A sandspur you get while walking
around at the beach or a carrot?

00:08:41.080 --> 00:08:43.710
Answer: A sandspur! The little
annoying thing that attaches

00:08:43.710 --> 00:08:47.180
to your pants is actually the
swollen up ovary of the flower.

00:08:47.180 --> 00:08:49.060
A carrot is a root of a plant.

00:08:49.060 --> 00:08:51.980
A stalk of celery or a
piece of dandelion fluff?

00:08:51.980 --> 00:08:54.820
The fluff! That little piece of
fluff is attached to a dry

00:08:54.820 --> 00:08:57.460
little fruit that contains the seed!

00:08:57.460 --> 00:09:00.070
Celery is the actual
stalk of the celery plant.

00:09:00.070 --> 00:09:02.200
A strawberry or a zucchini?

00:09:02.200 --> 00:09:05.220
The zucchini! A strawberry is
actually the swollen end

00:09:05.220 --> 00:09:08.580
of the stem of the strawberry flower,
so it doesn't contain the seed.

00:09:08.580 --> 00:09:09.570
It actually has the
seeds on the outside.

00:09:09.570 --> 00:09:12.680
Each one of the hard little things
on the outside of the strawberry?

00:09:12.680 --> 00:09:14.880
Those are the fruit.
Some people argue about this,

00:09:14.880 --> 00:09:17.450
because what seems more
fruity than a strawberry?

00:09:17.450 --> 00:09:21.300
But zucchinis? They're definitely
fruits because they contain seeds.

00:09:21.300 --> 00:09:23.250
Fruits are important to angiosperms,
because they like to get

00:09:23.250 --> 00:09:26.330
their seeds as far away from
themselves as possible so that

00:09:26.330 --> 00:09:27.880
they're not competing
with their own offspring.

00:09:27.880 --> 00:09:30.410
So some fruits can be
carried away by the wind,

00:09:30.410 --> 00:09:32.920
while others move around
by being totally delicious,

00:09:32.920 --> 00:09:35.310
so they can be eaten by
an elephant and pooped out

00:09:35.310 --> 00:09:37.360
in an elephant turd far, far away.

00:09:37.360 --> 00:09:40.500
So that's the steamy sex
lives of vascular plants.

00:09:40.500 --> 00:09:44.140
Mmm. Ah, that is good.

00:09:44.140 --> 00:09:46.340
Thank you for watching this episode
of Crash Course Biology.

00:09:46.340 --> 00:09:49.150
This really is, like,
a perfect nectarine!

00:09:49.150 --> 00:09:51.890
Thanks to everyone who helped
put this episode together,

00:09:51.890 --> 00:09:53.630
including this nectarine.

00:09:53.630 --> 00:09:56.710
And if you want to go check
out any of the angiospermy mess

00:09:56.710 --> 00:09:58.210
that is the sex lives of plants:

00:09:58.210 --> 00:09:59.580
there's a table of
contents over there.

00:09:59.580 --> 00:10:01.200
