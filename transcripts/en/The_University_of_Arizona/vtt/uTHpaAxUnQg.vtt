00:00:14.650 --> 00:00:18.100
As I keep saying, as long as you
show up, we'll keep doing it.

00:00:18.100 --> 00:00:19.600
So please come over.

00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:25.810
Well, for all of you
that were here last week,

00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:29.014
you heard an amazing lecture
by Brother Guy Consolmagno,

00:00:29.014 --> 00:00:30.430
in which you learned
that we don't

00:00:30.430 --> 00:00:35.230
have any clue what life is, but
we put a lot of effort into it.

00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:36.730
My favorite definition
is, "You know

00:00:36.730 --> 00:00:38.440
it was alive when you kill it."

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:39.340
That was Engels.

00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:42.750
I thought that was brilliant.

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:46.320
I want to thank the sponsors
for the lecture series.

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:49.910
That's what allows us all to
come here and enjoy and learn

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:51.770
and be part of a community.

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:55.310
I want, in particular, to thank
Ventana Medical and TEP, which

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:58.040
are the lead sponsors,
but in back of me,

00:00:58.040 --> 00:01:00.500
you will see the rest
of the individuals that

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:02.690
make this free for all of us.

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:05.240
And I thank the sponsors
very, very much.

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:05.740
Thank you.

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:15.140
I also want to remind
all of you that this

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:17.360
is a tenth anniversary
of the lecture.

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:20.720
That means that we have a
pile of lectures and podcasts.

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:24.950
And I think you've all seen
looping through the screen

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:28.220
the various lectures that
we've had in the past.

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:30.830
You are welcome
to see the podcast

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:32.580
of all those past lectures.

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:33.920
They're extraordinary.

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:36.800
And you're also welcome,
if you live in a community

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:40.640
where you would like to
have a serious read done

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:42.770
by doing the podcast--
and we've done it

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:46.760
in the past-- we could probably
get a faculty member to show up

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:49.220
after the podcast as
seen by your community

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:52.160
and be there for
questions and answers.

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:57.590
Take that as an invitation
from the College of Science

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:58.460
to continue that.

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:04.940
Today, we're in for a treat.

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:07.940
Let me just share a little
bit, this is a spoiler.

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:11.180
When the earth was formed
about 4.5 billion years ago

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:14.150
as part of the solar
system, it was actually

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:21.209
bombarded by a variety of
comets and Mars-sized objects.

00:02:21.209 --> 00:02:23.750
And you can see the evidence of
that, of course, in the moon.

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:25.880
If you look at the moon, you'll
see that it's full of craters.

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:27.260
And the only reason
the earth isn't full

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:29.593
of craters, because it's about
the same age as the moon,

00:02:29.593 --> 00:02:32.420
is because it has plate
tectonics and it has erosion

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:34.790
and all of that
old crust is gone.

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:37.160
But the bottom line is
that the earth, when

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:40.040
it was first formed,
was bombarded

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:46.280
by such large impactors that it
partially melted at least once.

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:52.130
And all of the carbon that
was originally on the earth

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:54.334
must have gone
away, because it's

00:02:54.334 --> 00:02:56.500
an element that would have
just basically evaporated

00:02:56.500 --> 00:02:58.190
off the earth.

00:02:58.190 --> 00:03:00.890
One of the ideas, and
that's one of the things

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:02.810
that our speaker today
is going to talk about,

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:06.890
is that carbon from which we
are all made out of perhaps

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:09.680
was implanted in the
earth by later meteorites

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:11.370
or other objects.

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:13.370
The importance about that
is that you should all

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:15.550
remember that, in fact,
we're all Martians.

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:21.010
A little bit about our
speaker today, Dante Lauretta.

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:24.100
We're very fortunate that
Dante is part of our faculty.

00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:27.730
Dante actually got his
undergraduate degree here

00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:31.810
before he went off to George
Washington University in St.

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:32.980
Louis to get his PhD.

00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:35.470
But when he got his
bachelor's here,

00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:40.040
it was in physics,
mathematics, and Japanese.

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:42.290
I'm not exactly sure which
was the most important one.

00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:46.570
But he then went off
and he came back in 2001

00:03:46.570 --> 00:03:50.230
as a faculty member in
the College of Science.

00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:53.050
He, together with a team
of planetary sciences

00:03:53.050 --> 00:03:57.280
from our distinguished
planetary sciences department,

00:03:57.280 --> 00:03:59.830
got an award from NASA
for a billion dollars--

00:03:59.830 --> 00:04:01.840
the largest award
this university's ever

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:07.240
had from anybody--
to go and explore

00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:11.950
an extraterrestrial object,
collect parts of soil from it,

00:04:11.950 --> 00:04:14.650
and bring it back to Earth
so that we can actually

00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:20.290
compare the carbon rich material
of these objects to all of us.

00:04:20.290 --> 00:04:21.860
It's really, really cool.

00:04:21.860 --> 00:04:24.890
Dante is a very
distinguished faculty member.

00:04:24.890 --> 00:04:29.024
He just got an award
from Goddard Space Center

00:04:29.024 --> 00:04:34.390
for being a team-- that was
the osiris-rex team-- that

00:04:34.390 --> 00:04:39.170
was so successful in
getting this grant.

00:04:39.170 --> 00:04:43.180
He also got the governor's
innovation award in 2011.

00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:45.190
He's gotten awards,
also, for teaching.

00:04:45.190 --> 00:04:49.390
Just like most of our
extraordinary faculty members,

00:04:49.390 --> 00:04:50.560
he's a triple threat.

00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:52.690
He does extraordinary
research and he

00:04:52.690 --> 00:04:54.760
does extraordinary teaching.

00:04:54.760 --> 00:04:57.490
Please join me in
welcoming Dante Lauretta.

00:05:11.030 --> 00:05:12.180
Thank you, Joaquin.

00:05:12.180 --> 00:05:14.240
And thank you, everyone,
for coming out tonight.

00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:16.770
This is awesome.

00:05:16.770 --> 00:05:18.720
You can really tell
that Tucson is a science

00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:21.370
city when you get this kind
of crowd for a science lecture

00:05:21.370 --> 00:05:21.870
series.

00:05:21.870 --> 00:05:23.854
I'm really proud of
you guys and excited

00:05:23.854 --> 00:05:24.895
that you're here tonight.

00:05:30.890 --> 00:05:33.410
I'm going to take you
on a little journey

00:05:33.410 --> 00:05:36.470
to try to understand
how we got to be here.

00:05:36.470 --> 00:05:39.200
This is a question that
has driven my career.

00:05:39.200 --> 00:05:42.260
To really understand
why is earth so special,

00:05:42.260 --> 00:05:46.790
what happened here to give rise
to the earliest life forms,

00:05:46.790 --> 00:05:49.340
and how common is that process?

00:05:49.340 --> 00:05:52.304
Is it a one in one
trillion chance?

00:05:52.304 --> 00:05:53.720
Are we the only
place in the whole

00:05:53.720 --> 00:05:55.011
galaxy where this has happened?

00:05:55.011 --> 00:05:57.260
Or is it something that
we think might be common

00:05:57.260 --> 00:05:58.721
and might be
happening everywhere?

00:05:58.721 --> 00:06:00.470
It's one of the most
fundamental questions

00:06:00.470 --> 00:06:04.310
that humanity asks itself
is, where did we come from?

00:06:04.310 --> 00:06:06.290
And by virtue of that,
where are we going?

00:06:06.290 --> 00:06:08.690
So let's go on this
journey and try

00:06:08.690 --> 00:06:11.990
to understand the origin of
life, and try to understand,

00:06:11.990 --> 00:06:14.240
is that something that's
a natural byproduct

00:06:14.240 --> 00:06:17.520
of the formation of planets.

00:06:17.520 --> 00:06:19.500
I'm going to take
the approach-- I'm

00:06:19.500 --> 00:06:22.620
going to start out by looking
at life on earth today.

00:06:22.620 --> 00:06:24.510
This is a fantastic
lecture series

00:06:24.510 --> 00:06:27.360
that Joaquin and his team
have put together for us,

00:06:27.360 --> 00:06:30.030
because you're going to hear a
wide range of topics that cover

00:06:30.030 --> 00:06:31.980
a lot of different approaches.

00:06:31.980 --> 00:06:34.680
I'm going to say, well, we
know life exists on Earth.

00:06:34.680 --> 00:06:37.186
We can speculate about what
it might be like elsewhere--

00:06:37.186 --> 00:06:39.810
and some of our colleagues will
do that-- but I'm going to say,

00:06:39.810 --> 00:06:43.210
we know it's here, we want to
understand how it got here.

00:06:43.210 --> 00:06:44.910
And so we're going
to first visit

00:06:44.910 --> 00:06:48.930
this concept that we call the
last universal common ancestor.

00:06:48.930 --> 00:06:50.784
We can go into our
genetic records.

00:06:50.784 --> 00:06:52.200
We can go into the
genetic records

00:06:52.200 --> 00:06:53.520
of all organisms on Earth.

00:06:53.520 --> 00:06:54.900
And we can trace
it back and say,

00:06:54.900 --> 00:06:58.560
there was a point in time where
there was one organism that

00:06:58.560 --> 00:07:01.290
is the ancestor to everything
else that exists on our planet

00:07:01.290 --> 00:07:01.830
today.

00:07:01.830 --> 00:07:04.050
We're going to see what
we can learn about that.

00:07:04.050 --> 00:07:06.480
And then we're going to
use that to understand

00:07:06.480 --> 00:07:08.370
the basic biochemistry of life.

00:07:08.370 --> 00:07:12.510
We all share the same molecular
processes in our cells,

00:07:12.510 --> 00:07:15.330
between each other, the
other animals, the plants,

00:07:15.330 --> 00:07:17.890
the bacteria, the
archaea, et cetera.

00:07:17.890 --> 00:07:19.440
So we'll take a look at that.

00:07:19.440 --> 00:07:22.940
And then we'll try to
understand, how do you

00:07:22.940 --> 00:07:24.740
get the central elements?

00:07:24.740 --> 00:07:26.660
As we'll see, there's
really six elements

00:07:26.660 --> 00:07:29.510
that are critical for all the
biochemistry that takes place.

00:07:29.510 --> 00:07:30.860
Lots of other elements come in.

00:07:30.860 --> 00:07:32.710
You've all probably
looked at your Centrum,

00:07:32.710 --> 00:07:36.230
seen that big list of elements
that are in your mineral list.

00:07:36.230 --> 00:07:38.660
Say, geez, do I really need
that much selenium today?

00:07:38.660 --> 00:07:39.285
I don't know.

00:07:39.285 --> 00:07:41.660
But we're not going to talk
about the origin of selenium,

00:07:41.660 --> 00:07:43.576
we're really going to
take a look at the ones,

00:07:43.576 --> 00:07:45.710
the core six, and
how we got here.

00:07:45.710 --> 00:07:47.610
Then, how did
these guys combine?

00:07:47.610 --> 00:07:50.240
So We can look at the atoms, and
take that atomistic approach,

00:07:50.240 --> 00:07:51.989
but it's really the
molecules where things

00:07:51.989 --> 00:07:53.150
start to get interesting.

00:07:53.150 --> 00:07:56.240
And, where are these
molecules forming?

00:07:56.240 --> 00:07:59.090
And then the
astrophysical environments

00:07:59.090 --> 00:08:01.040
that lead to the
planet formation

00:08:01.040 --> 00:08:06.500
and therefore where the origin
of life proceeded apace.

00:08:06.500 --> 00:08:10.420
And then finally, how
did they get from space

00:08:10.420 --> 00:08:11.710
to the early Earth?

00:08:11.710 --> 00:08:14.530
And what might be going only
on the surface of our planet

00:08:14.530 --> 00:08:17.590
that ultimately led this
transition from chemistry

00:08:17.590 --> 00:08:19.150
to biology?

00:08:19.150 --> 00:08:21.310
Let's go ahead and take
a look at this idea

00:08:21.310 --> 00:08:23.080
of the least common ancestor.

00:08:23.080 --> 00:08:26.170
Here you have a nice
artistic version

00:08:26.170 --> 00:08:28.420
of what we call
the tree of life.

00:08:28.420 --> 00:08:29.920
I want to start out
here at the top.

00:08:29.920 --> 00:08:32.919
When we look at all the
organisms on the planet,

00:08:32.919 --> 00:08:36.380
we can really divide them
up into three major groups.

00:08:36.380 --> 00:08:39.590
We have the bacteria, which I
think we're all familiar with.

00:08:39.590 --> 00:08:42.940
We have the eukarya, which term
you may not have heard before,

00:08:42.940 --> 00:08:45.070
but it really means
organisms that

00:08:45.070 --> 00:08:47.650
have a very specific
structure to their cells.

00:08:47.650 --> 00:08:49.960
They have a nucleus
and inside that nucleus

00:08:49.960 --> 00:08:52.150
is where their DNA
is, the code that

00:08:52.150 --> 00:08:54.460
defines that organism
and everything that

00:08:54.460 --> 00:08:56.350
happens inside that organism.

00:08:56.350 --> 00:08:58.870
And it turns out,
we are the eukarya.

00:08:58.870 --> 00:09:01.660
So are all of the animals,
all the plants and a lot

00:09:01.660 --> 00:09:03.610
of single-celled
organisms are eukarya.

00:09:03.610 --> 00:09:05.800
We all share that
common characteristic

00:09:05.800 --> 00:09:08.980
of having the DNA inside
of a nucleus of the cell.

00:09:08.980 --> 00:09:10.480
Bacteria don't have that.

00:09:10.480 --> 00:09:13.539
DNA floats freely
around in the interior.

00:09:13.539 --> 00:09:15.080
And then you get
this interesting one

00:09:15.080 --> 00:09:16.020
called the archaea.

00:09:16.020 --> 00:09:18.840
It was the last one
to be identified.

00:09:18.840 --> 00:09:20.319
They're single celled organisms.

00:09:20.319 --> 00:09:22.360
They have a lot of
commonality with the bacteria,

00:09:22.360 --> 00:09:24.970
but they share some of the
cell wall characteristics

00:09:24.970 --> 00:09:26.110
with the eukarya.

00:09:26.110 --> 00:09:29.420
And they really are a different
branch to the tree of life.

00:09:29.420 --> 00:09:32.680
So you can see that there is
this complicated evolution

00:09:32.680 --> 00:09:33.340
from today.

00:09:33.340 --> 00:09:35.920
We can trace back to
a billion years ago.

00:09:35.920 --> 00:09:38.410
We can see here, where the
eukarya and the archaea

00:09:38.410 --> 00:09:41.272
split from each other, where
the bacteria and the archaea

00:09:41.272 --> 00:09:42.730
split from each
other and went down

00:09:42.730 --> 00:09:45.040
their own separate
evolutionary pathways.

00:09:45.040 --> 00:09:47.920
We get back to this
point, some time

00:09:47.920 --> 00:09:50.290
more than three
billion years ago,

00:09:50.290 --> 00:09:53.080
where this last common
ancestor existed.

00:09:53.080 --> 00:09:56.710
And we say, well, what is
it that all of these share?

00:09:56.710 --> 00:09:58.960
You might think, well, I
don't have anything in common

00:09:58.960 --> 00:10:00.970
with a palm tree, but you do.

00:10:00.970 --> 00:10:03.770
The mechanisms inside your
cells are very, very similar.

00:10:03.770 --> 00:10:06.250
The basic biochemistry
of life is

00:10:06.250 --> 00:10:08.800
common to all of
those organisms.

00:10:08.800 --> 00:10:12.430
Really, what drives us is,
we take these molecules

00:10:12.430 --> 00:10:14.650
and we code information.

00:10:14.650 --> 00:10:17.540
That information
is inside your DNA.

00:10:17.540 --> 00:10:19.750
And DNA is a recipe
book for everything

00:10:19.750 --> 00:10:21.940
that has to happen
inside your body.

00:10:21.940 --> 00:10:24.340
What it does is it tells
your body and the cells

00:10:24.340 --> 00:10:25.990
how do I make proteins.

00:10:25.990 --> 00:10:27.460
You need proteins
for your muscles,

00:10:27.460 --> 00:10:29.020
you need proteins for your hair.

00:10:29.020 --> 00:10:31.960
You need proteins that catalyze
the metabolic reactions that

00:10:31.960 --> 00:10:35.170
give you energy and
allow you to be alive.

00:10:35.170 --> 00:10:39.670
So if the DNA is the library,
the proteins are the books,

00:10:39.670 --> 00:10:42.610
and they go out and they do
all the work inside your body.

00:10:42.610 --> 00:10:44.800
The last common
ancestor we think

00:10:44.800 --> 00:10:47.080
had this basic
biochemistry established.

00:10:47.080 --> 00:10:47.980
It had DNA.

00:10:47.980 --> 00:10:51.100
It had genes, which are
the strips of DNA that

00:10:51.100 --> 00:10:53.260
code for an individual protein.

00:10:53.260 --> 00:10:56.830
And then it used the DNA-- it
has a messenger molecule that's

00:10:56.830 --> 00:10:59.260
similar, called RNA,
that leaves the nucleus

00:10:59.260 --> 00:11:01.810
of the cell for the eukaryotes
and goes out and builds

00:11:01.810 --> 00:11:03.280
the proteins.

00:11:03.280 --> 00:11:06.087
All of that has to happen in
a self-contained environment,

00:11:06.087 --> 00:11:07.420
and that's what a cell gets you.

00:11:07.420 --> 00:11:10.224
It gets you that nice,
chemically-closed system,

00:11:10.224 --> 00:11:12.640
where you have membranes for
transporting the species that

00:11:12.640 --> 00:11:14.440
are needed inside of there.

00:11:14.440 --> 00:11:17.600
We know that that happens
in every cell in our body.

00:11:17.600 --> 00:11:19.330
It happens in every
cell on earth,

00:11:19.330 --> 00:11:23.290
whether you're bacteria,
eukarya, or archaea.

00:11:23.290 --> 00:11:24.880
How do we make that happen?

00:11:24.880 --> 00:11:28.090
Well, let's take a look at the
common elements that drive that

00:11:28.090 --> 00:11:30.640
and where they come from.

00:11:30.640 --> 00:11:34.464
In the beginning, we had this
event we called the Big Bang.

00:11:34.464 --> 00:11:36.630
And I was just talking to
a couple of folks about it

00:11:36.630 --> 00:11:38.640
right before the
lecture started today,

00:11:38.640 --> 00:11:41.430
and people ask me, well, how
do we know that this happened?

00:11:41.430 --> 00:11:44.950
Well, it was so big
that we still hear it.

00:11:44.950 --> 00:11:47.610
When we look out to the
edge of our universe,

00:11:47.610 --> 00:11:50.340
we see this background
radiation, cosmic microwave

00:11:50.340 --> 00:11:52.530
background radiation,
which is the energy that

00:11:52.530 --> 00:11:54.090
escaped from the Big Bang.

00:11:54.090 --> 00:11:55.770
And it's been
propagating through space

00:11:55.770 --> 00:11:57.859
for 13.8 billion years.

00:11:57.859 --> 00:11:59.400
Well, coming out of
that event, there

00:11:59.400 --> 00:12:02.432
was really only two elements--
hydrogen and helium.

00:12:02.432 --> 00:12:04.890
Helium, you're probably pretty
familiar with if you've ever

00:12:04.890 --> 00:12:06.420
been to a birthday party.

00:12:06.420 --> 00:12:08.130
Fills up the balloons.

00:12:08.130 --> 00:12:11.880
It's really fun to breathe it
in and talk like Mickey Mouse.

00:12:11.880 --> 00:12:16.680
Hydrogen is a common rocket
fuel, very explosive compound.

00:12:16.680 --> 00:12:20.610
It mixes with oxygen and
you get that lift off.

00:12:20.610 --> 00:12:22.240
But that's not enough
to create life.

00:12:22.240 --> 00:12:24.410
In fact, that's not even
enough to create planets.

00:12:24.410 --> 00:12:26.160
Pretty much the only
thing in the universe

00:12:26.160 --> 00:12:28.890
you can create with these
two elements are stars.

00:12:28.890 --> 00:12:32.160
And the stars are
giant nuclear furnaces.

00:12:32.160 --> 00:12:35.000
Inside the interior
of the sun, right now,

00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:36.960
today, even though
it's nighttime,

00:12:36.960 --> 00:12:38.430
the reaction is still going on.

00:12:44.070 --> 00:12:47.460
In the core of our sun,
we're taking hydrogen atoms

00:12:47.460 --> 00:12:50.760
and we're smashing together
at millions of degrees,

00:12:50.760 --> 00:12:52.630
and we're building
helium out of them.

00:12:52.630 --> 00:12:56.190
Take four hydrogen, smash
them together, you get helium.

00:12:56.190 --> 00:12:58.365
Bigger stars like that process.

00:12:58.365 --> 00:12:59.490
They don't want to give up.

00:12:59.490 --> 00:13:02.140
The only thing that's
stopping is gravity,

00:13:02.140 --> 00:13:04.830
but if gravity can pull
you down tight enough,

00:13:04.830 --> 00:13:07.560
if you're a big enough
star, you can actually

00:13:07.560 --> 00:13:09.750
cram three helium
atoms together,

00:13:09.750 --> 00:13:11.670
and you can get carbon.

00:13:11.670 --> 00:13:12.670
And now, you're talking.

00:13:12.670 --> 00:13:14.910
Now you're going to get
something interesting going.

00:13:14.910 --> 00:13:17.530
You add another
helium, you get oxygen,

00:13:17.530 --> 00:13:19.720
and that actually kicks
off a catalytic cycle

00:13:19.720 --> 00:13:22.420
we call the
carbon-nitrogen-oxygen cycle,

00:13:22.420 --> 00:13:25.600
where the presence of
carbon actually makes

00:13:25.600 --> 00:13:27.220
this reaction go a lot faster.

00:13:27.220 --> 00:13:29.230
Hydrogen into helium,
and a byproduct of that

00:13:29.230 --> 00:13:33.974
is nitrogen. You continue
to add helium atoms

00:13:33.974 --> 00:13:35.140
and you'll get up to sulfur.

00:13:35.140 --> 00:13:36.848
And I want to stop
here a minute and just

00:13:36.848 --> 00:13:39.900
take a look at the atomic
weights of these elements.

00:13:39.900 --> 00:13:41.830
You've got helium that's 4.

00:13:41.830 --> 00:13:42.810
Carbon, that's 12.

00:13:42.810 --> 00:13:44.860
That makes sense,
that's four helium.

00:13:44.860 --> 00:13:46.224
Oxygen is 16.

00:13:46.224 --> 00:13:47.890
That's-- I'm sorry,
that's three helium.

00:13:47.890 --> 00:13:49.700
Oxygen is 16.

00:13:49.700 --> 00:13:50.350
Go back here.

00:13:52.920 --> 00:13:54.420
Sulfur is 32.

00:13:54.420 --> 00:13:56.490
We get over here to
phosphorus, and it's 31.

00:13:56.490 --> 00:13:58.650
And that's an odd number
and nuclear reactions

00:13:58.650 --> 00:13:59.804
don't like odd numbers.

00:13:59.804 --> 00:14:00.720
They don't favor them.

00:14:00.720 --> 00:14:02.730
That's going to turn out
to be pretty important.

00:14:02.730 --> 00:14:04.470
It's a side chain
reaction, so that

00:14:04.470 --> 00:14:05.970
means there's not
a lot of it around

00:14:05.970 --> 00:14:08.490
compared to these
other elements.

00:14:08.490 --> 00:14:10.641
It's going to become the
limiting nutrient for life

00:14:10.641 --> 00:14:11.140
on Earth.

00:14:11.140 --> 00:14:12.639
As we'll see, it's
critical and I'll

00:14:12.639 --> 00:14:16.350
tell you how we solved
some of that mystery.

00:14:16.350 --> 00:14:19.320
The universe took those
hydrogen and helium atoms,

00:14:19.320 --> 00:14:20.430
created stars.

00:14:20.430 --> 00:14:23.610
The first generation of
stars produced these six

00:14:23.610 --> 00:14:25.110
interesting elements.

00:14:25.110 --> 00:14:27.900
When you add carbon to
hydrogen, you get hydrocarbons.

00:14:27.900 --> 00:14:30.690
You're probably familiar
with these, like natural gas.

00:14:30.690 --> 00:14:32.100
Use it to cook with.

00:14:32.100 --> 00:14:40.810
Really burns well with oxygen.
You bring in the oxygen,

00:14:40.810 --> 00:14:43.061
and now you're getting
carbohydrates and lipids.

00:14:43.061 --> 00:14:44.310
We know we like carbohydrates.

00:14:44.310 --> 00:14:46.050
They're really tasty.

00:14:46.050 --> 00:14:48.360
And the lipids are really
important because that's what

00:14:48.360 --> 00:14:50.490
makes up the cell membranes.

00:14:50.490 --> 00:14:52.560
Now you're getting some
interesting chemistry,

00:14:52.560 --> 00:14:55.410
but you still don't have life.

00:14:55.410 --> 00:14:57.870
You bring in nitrogen, and
you get something really cool,

00:14:57.870 --> 00:15:00.000
you get the amino acids.

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:02.490
And there's dozens of these
that are produced in nature.

00:15:02.490 --> 00:15:05.641
And now you could
build proteins.

00:15:05.641 --> 00:15:06.640
You bring in the sulfur.

00:15:06.640 --> 00:15:09.890
You get a wider diversity
of amino acids and proteins.

00:15:09.890 --> 00:15:12.940
But it's this phosphorous
that needs to kick in order

00:15:12.940 --> 00:15:15.580
to get the DNA and RNA.

00:15:15.580 --> 00:15:17.320
You won't have
life, you won't have

00:15:17.320 --> 00:15:20.140
information-bearing molecules,
at least as we know it,

00:15:20.140 --> 00:15:22.450
on this planet unless
that phosphorus gets

00:15:22.450 --> 00:15:24.070
into the system.

00:15:24.070 --> 00:15:26.620
That was a question very
early on in my career

00:15:26.620 --> 00:15:28.930
I was really interested in.

00:15:28.930 --> 00:15:31.450
And I'll tell you
why in a little bit.

00:15:31.450 --> 00:15:35.380
So now, we know, OK, stars
inside their interiors

00:15:35.380 --> 00:15:36.790
are generating energy.

00:15:36.790 --> 00:15:37.840
They burn bright.

00:15:37.840 --> 00:15:40.060
They give us sunlight.

00:15:40.060 --> 00:15:41.367
But they don't live forever.

00:15:41.367 --> 00:15:42.950
Nothing in the
universe lives forever.

00:15:42.950 --> 00:15:45.241
They're going to burn through
that fuel and at the end,

00:15:45.241 --> 00:15:46.540
gravity always wins.

00:15:46.540 --> 00:15:48.820
Gravity is just going to
keep crushing you down.

00:15:48.820 --> 00:15:50.080
You're going to have
that nuclear energy.

00:15:50.080 --> 00:15:52.090
You're going be able to
push them off for a while.

00:15:52.090 --> 00:15:53.465
But at the end of
the day, you're

00:15:53.465 --> 00:15:56.500
going to run out of fuel, and
gravity is going to take over.

00:15:56.500 --> 00:15:57.940
And what happens
is, you get some

00:15:57.940 --> 00:16:00.730
of the most energetic
explosions in the universe.

00:16:00.730 --> 00:16:05.000
You get supernova, when
the giant stars explode.

00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:07.940
What's happening is, we're
in this giant molecular cloud

00:16:07.940 --> 00:16:08.930
region here.

00:16:08.930 --> 00:16:10.310
And everything's nice and quiet.

00:16:10.310 --> 00:16:12.260
You got these really
bright stars burning

00:16:12.260 --> 00:16:16.430
through their lifetime, creating
these fundamental elements

00:16:16.430 --> 00:16:19.550
that'll go on to create
the biochemical molecules.

00:16:19.550 --> 00:16:22.160
But somehow, they got to get
out there and here we go.

00:16:22.160 --> 00:16:24.080
We're at the end of
the star's lifetime.

00:16:24.080 --> 00:16:25.550
It's trying to hang on.

00:16:25.550 --> 00:16:27.260
It goes through
some pulsing phases,

00:16:27.260 --> 00:16:30.410
where a little bit more nuclear
fuel gets into its center.

00:16:30.410 --> 00:16:32.030
Finally, it's done.

00:16:32.030 --> 00:16:33.110
It explodes.

00:16:33.110 --> 00:16:36.380
And it throws most of its matter
back out into the universe,

00:16:36.380 --> 00:16:39.620
into what we call this
interstellar medium.

00:16:39.620 --> 00:16:41.720
Not only is it the
stellar graveyard,

00:16:41.720 --> 00:16:43.430
where these giant
stars are running

00:16:43.430 --> 00:16:46.426
through their nuclear fuel
and dying and throwing off

00:16:46.426 --> 00:16:48.050
everything they
created back out there,

00:16:48.050 --> 00:16:50.400
but it's also a stellar nursery.

00:16:50.400 --> 00:16:51.890
This is where stars are born.

00:16:51.890 --> 00:16:55.010
Same place that these
giant stars are dying.

00:16:55.010 --> 00:16:56.660
Now, we can look
at these regions--

00:16:56.660 --> 00:16:59.300
and this is one of my favorite
astronomical photographs.

00:16:59.300 --> 00:17:03.286
It's actually an infrared
image of the Orion nebula.

00:17:03.286 --> 00:17:05.660
Many of you may be familiar
with the Orion constellation,

00:17:05.660 --> 00:17:09.530
and this is right in his belt.
With a good pair of binoculars,

00:17:09.530 --> 00:17:12.579
you can actually
see this feature.

00:17:12.579 --> 00:17:14.798
It turns out, when we
look even farther out

00:17:14.798 --> 00:17:16.839
into the infrared, what
we call the far infrared,

00:17:16.839 --> 00:17:19.599
or into the microwave,
we see that there's

00:17:19.599 --> 00:17:22.520
all kinds of interesting
signals out here.

00:17:22.520 --> 00:17:24.520
Every one of these lines
that were showing up

00:17:24.520 --> 00:17:26.770
as we scan across these
different wavelengths

00:17:26.770 --> 00:17:28.711
are a different molecule.

00:17:28.711 --> 00:17:30.460
And we see some really
interesting things.

00:17:30.460 --> 00:17:32.910
First of all, you see is
a lot of water out there.

00:17:32.910 --> 00:17:34.650
That's good news,
because we think water

00:17:34.650 --> 00:17:36.510
is central to life on Earth.

00:17:36.510 --> 00:17:40.305
We think it was important fluid
for all of these reactions

00:17:40.305 --> 00:17:41.610
to take place.

00:17:41.610 --> 00:17:44.070
It's inside our bodies.

00:17:44.070 --> 00:17:46.470
It's not a coincidence
that when you cry,

00:17:46.470 --> 00:17:49.470
the composition of your tears
is seawater, essentially.

00:17:49.470 --> 00:17:52.440
That's where we came from, and
we think it's critical for life

00:17:52.440 --> 00:17:54.580
to originate, at least
life as we know it.

00:17:54.580 --> 00:17:56.580
But there's a lot of other
things going on here.

00:17:56.580 --> 00:17:58.680
You've got methanol, and
you've got formaldehyde,

00:17:58.680 --> 00:18:02.910
and you've got deuterium
cyanide, sulfur dioxides.

00:18:02.910 --> 00:18:04.126
And a lot of other things.

00:18:04.126 --> 00:18:05.500
Like this region
right over here,

00:18:05.500 --> 00:18:07.320
there's a lot of
complicated molecules

00:18:07.320 --> 00:18:09.690
that are being expressed
in that signal there.

00:18:09.690 --> 00:18:11.880
As we go through and we
process this information,

00:18:11.880 --> 00:18:14.550
we see there's over
100 different molecules

00:18:14.550 --> 00:18:16.230
in these star-forming regions.

00:18:16.230 --> 00:18:19.200
Most of them are
organic molecules.

00:18:19.200 --> 00:18:21.300
Already, you create
these elements

00:18:21.300 --> 00:18:24.060
in the interior of the star,
you throw them off into space,

00:18:24.060 --> 00:18:26.100
the whole system cools
down, and the first thing

00:18:26.100 --> 00:18:29.970
that nature tries to do is
create organic compounds.

00:18:29.970 --> 00:18:33.390
It seems like there's a drive
that's taking place here

00:18:33.390 --> 00:18:35.370
to go from the
fundamental process that

00:18:35.370 --> 00:18:38.280
drives stellar energy,
turn it into something

00:18:38.280 --> 00:18:41.430
else, planetary systems.

00:18:41.430 --> 00:18:43.260
We'll take a look at
our own solar system

00:18:43.260 --> 00:18:45.810
and say, well, we're looking
out there at the Orion nebula.

00:18:45.810 --> 00:18:48.250
We see these stars being born.

00:18:48.250 --> 00:18:50.340
What do we think happened
in our solar system?

00:18:50.340 --> 00:18:51.840
And we have the
very good fortune

00:18:51.840 --> 00:18:54.690
that a lot of
samples from this era

00:18:54.690 --> 00:18:57.400
still exist in the
form of our asteroids.

00:18:57.400 --> 00:18:59.940
Asteroids are the
geologic remnants

00:18:59.940 --> 00:19:03.062
from the earliest stages
of solar system formation.

00:19:03.062 --> 00:19:04.770
You want to understand
what the earth was

00:19:04.770 --> 00:19:08.370
like when the last universal
common ancestor was wiggling

00:19:08.370 --> 00:19:10.340
around 3.8 billion years ago?

00:19:10.340 --> 00:19:12.977
Well we don't have a whole
lot of rocks from that era.

00:19:12.977 --> 00:19:15.060
You want to know, well,
what happened before that?

00:19:15.060 --> 00:19:18.840
What were the earliest phases
of planetary formation?

00:19:18.840 --> 00:19:21.271
You have to go to
these meteorites.

00:19:21.271 --> 00:19:22.020
Let's take a look.

00:19:22.020 --> 00:19:23.978
This is a very special
kind of meteorite called

00:19:23.978 --> 00:19:25.770
the carbonaceous chondrites.

00:19:25.770 --> 00:19:30.240
It happens to be full of
really interesting inclusions.

00:19:30.240 --> 00:19:31.740
First, I want to
draw your attention

00:19:31.740 --> 00:19:33.900
to most of the grains in here.

00:19:33.900 --> 00:19:37.500
They kind of look rounded like
little grains of sand, maybe.

00:19:37.500 --> 00:19:39.959
We call these things chondrules.

00:19:39.959 --> 00:19:42.000
And these turn out to be
the fundamental building

00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:43.170
blocks of planets.

00:19:43.170 --> 00:19:44.740
They're about a
millimeter in size.

00:19:44.740 --> 00:19:47.250
Note that this is about 10
centimeters, or just under four

00:19:47.250 --> 00:19:48.840
inches across here.

00:19:48.840 --> 00:19:52.200
And they record early stages
of planetary formation, where

00:19:52.200 --> 00:19:55.680
giant flashes of heat were
propagating through and melting

00:19:55.680 --> 00:19:57.242
everything in sight.

00:19:57.242 --> 00:19:58.950
They're wildly different
from each other.

00:19:58.950 --> 00:20:01.230
We call this an
unequilibrated rock,

00:20:01.230 --> 00:20:04.560
which means every chondrule
tells it's own story.

00:20:04.560 --> 00:20:07.260
I'll never forget when I first
got one of these meteorites

00:20:07.260 --> 00:20:08.850
in the lab and I was
going to study it

00:20:08.850 --> 00:20:10.720
and I saw all these great
chondrules, and I said,

00:20:10.720 --> 00:20:12.386
I'm going to look at
every one of these.

00:20:12.386 --> 00:20:14.400
This is going to be a
great research project.

00:20:14.400 --> 00:20:16.770
I'm going to tear
this rock apart.

00:20:16.770 --> 00:20:20.250
And two years later, I'd gotten
through about 40 of them.

00:20:20.250 --> 00:20:22.080
And I was like, man,
they're all different.

00:20:22.080 --> 00:20:23.010
I got to stop.

00:20:23.010 --> 00:20:24.900
Right I got to publish
something or else I

00:20:24.900 --> 00:20:29.671
won't get this great job at the
U of A that I'm angling for.

00:20:29.671 --> 00:20:32.170
But you're like, why are you
talking about those chondrules?

00:20:32.170 --> 00:20:33.837
Dude, there's this
giant white inclusion

00:20:33.837 --> 00:20:35.503
sitting in the middle
of this rock here.

00:20:35.503 --> 00:20:36.370
Take a look at that.

00:20:36.370 --> 00:20:38.980
That turns out to be
really fascinating.

00:20:38.980 --> 00:20:41.830
It turns out these are what
we call calcium aluminum

00:20:41.830 --> 00:20:44.470
rich inclusions, or
calcium aluminum oxides,

00:20:44.470 --> 00:20:47.260
and they're what we call
refractory minerals.

00:20:47.260 --> 00:20:49.390
For example, we use
these kinds of materials

00:20:49.390 --> 00:20:52.660
industrially to make space
shuttle tiles for re-entering

00:20:52.660 --> 00:20:54.610
vehicles into the atmosphere.

00:20:54.610 --> 00:21:00.200
They survive as solids at
very high temperatures.

00:21:00.200 --> 00:21:03.150
And so it's not a surprise
that we see these things

00:21:03.150 --> 00:21:06.990
as the oldest minerals, because
the model for solar system

00:21:06.990 --> 00:21:10.110
formation is you have this
cloud that's collapsing,

00:21:10.110 --> 00:21:12.420
it gets very hot, and then
it starts to cool off.

00:21:12.420 --> 00:21:15.690
And so the first things that
condense out like snowflakes

00:21:15.690 --> 00:21:18.770
are calcium and
aluminum rich minerals.

00:21:18.770 --> 00:21:22.280
It turns out we can go in and
we can take a really good look

00:21:22.280 --> 00:21:24.290
at the chemistry
of these objects.

00:21:24.290 --> 00:21:28.010
And we can say, well, they've
got some uranium in them.

00:21:28.010 --> 00:21:30.234
Uranium is a
radioactive isotope.

00:21:30.234 --> 00:21:31.400
We're very familiar with it.

00:21:31.400 --> 00:21:33.350
We know how long
it takes to decay.

00:21:33.350 --> 00:21:36.320
It takes billions of years
to completely decay away,

00:21:36.320 --> 00:21:38.120
and it decays into lead.

00:21:38.120 --> 00:21:41.060
We can measure very precisely
the isotopes of uranium

00:21:41.060 --> 00:21:44.690
and isotopes of lead, and
we can figure out the age.

00:21:44.690 --> 00:21:47.630
These measurements show
us that the solar system

00:21:47.630 --> 00:21:49.146
is 4.5 billion years old.

00:21:49.146 --> 00:21:51.020
And you probably have
heard that quite a lot.

00:21:51.020 --> 00:21:53.840
How do you know the solar
system is 4.5 billion years old?

00:21:53.840 --> 00:21:56.300
Well, when I say that,
what I'm really saying is,

00:21:56.300 --> 00:21:59.510
I've got these minerals
inside these rocks

00:21:59.510 --> 00:22:02.060
that I can date very
precisely with my uranium lead

00:22:02.060 --> 00:22:04.790
techniques, and those
are 4.5 years old,

00:22:04.790 --> 00:22:06.890
and I haven't found
anything else that's older.

00:22:06.890 --> 00:22:09.980
So that's the oldest thing and
all of my ages moving forward

00:22:09.980 --> 00:22:12.499
are going to be relative
to that mineral phase.

00:22:12.499 --> 00:22:13.790
And that's held up really well.

00:22:13.790 --> 00:22:15.998
These things have been
studied for about 40 years now

00:22:15.998 --> 00:22:17.960
and we haven't found
anything older.

00:22:17.960 --> 00:22:20.090
We find out that they formed
in a very tight window

00:22:20.090 --> 00:22:22.880
of about 100,000 years, which
is nothing in the geologic time

00:22:22.880 --> 00:22:23.564
scale.

00:22:23.564 --> 00:22:25.730
And in fact, the chondrules
are pretty old, as well,

00:22:25.730 --> 00:22:28.341
but they formed about two to
four million years after that.

00:22:28.341 --> 00:22:29.840
And so we spent a
lot of time trying

00:22:29.840 --> 00:22:33.200
to sort out the details
of how these rocks formed.

00:22:33.200 --> 00:22:35.030
Where do these things come from?

00:22:35.030 --> 00:22:37.340
I told you a little bit
about the model here,

00:22:37.340 --> 00:22:38.270
but let's take a look.

00:22:38.270 --> 00:22:40.100
Let's go back into
that Orion nebula.

00:22:40.100 --> 00:22:42.350
We're going to do a
little fly through here.

00:22:42.350 --> 00:22:44.150
Note the four stars
in the center there,

00:22:44.150 --> 00:22:46.010
we call those the trapezium.

00:22:46.010 --> 00:22:47.910
Those are objects
that are going to go

00:22:47.910 --> 00:22:51.230
nova or supernova at the
end of their short lifetime.

00:22:51.230 --> 00:22:53.090
You could see their
energy is already

00:22:53.090 --> 00:22:57.224
influencing pockets of dust and
gas that's surrounding them.

00:22:57.224 --> 00:22:58.640
These little things
that look like

00:22:58.640 --> 00:23:01.430
tadpoles-- we call
those proplyds.

00:23:01.430 --> 00:23:03.860
This is an actual rendition
of the Orion nebula.

00:23:03.860 --> 00:23:06.170
All of these objects
have been identified.

00:23:06.170 --> 00:23:08.840
And then we can peer inside one
of these things and say, well,

00:23:08.840 --> 00:23:09.980
what's going on in there?

00:23:09.980 --> 00:23:11.480
How big is this?

00:23:11.480 --> 00:23:13.970
Well, turns out when
we strip away that gas,

00:23:13.970 --> 00:23:17.250
we're looking at a new
star that's being born.

00:23:17.250 --> 00:23:19.610
And inside Orion, we're looking
at hundreds of new stars

00:23:19.610 --> 00:23:20.780
that are being born.

00:23:20.780 --> 00:23:23.240
And we see they have
this very common feature,

00:23:23.240 --> 00:23:27.050
that the star is forming at the
center, and a disk of material

00:23:27.050 --> 00:23:29.060
is spinning out around them.

00:23:29.060 --> 00:23:30.650
That actually is a
natural consequence

00:23:30.650 --> 00:23:33.740
of a basic physics property
called angular momentum.

00:23:33.740 --> 00:23:37.580
We're all familiar with the ice
skater who starts to rotate.

00:23:37.580 --> 00:23:39.020
And then as she
pulls her arms in,

00:23:39.020 --> 00:23:40.410
she spins faster and faster.

00:23:40.410 --> 00:23:42.750
That's due to conservation
of angular momentum.

00:23:42.750 --> 00:23:45.607
Well, turns out these clouds,
when they start to collapse,

00:23:45.607 --> 00:23:46.940
they have some angular momentum.

00:23:46.940 --> 00:23:48.710
There's a net rotation.

00:23:48.710 --> 00:23:51.530
And if you try to cram all of
that stuff down to the center

00:23:51.530 --> 00:23:53.690
into the star, it
would fall apart.

00:23:53.690 --> 00:23:56.544
It would just be too much
of that rotational energy.

00:23:56.544 --> 00:23:58.460
So in order to conserve
that angular momentum,

00:23:58.460 --> 00:24:01.820
a fraction of the material
doesn't go into the star.

00:24:01.820 --> 00:24:05.270
It goes into this surrounding
protoplanetary disk.

00:24:05.270 --> 00:24:07.672
That's really good news for
us, because inside that disk

00:24:07.672 --> 00:24:09.380
is where all of the
interesting chemistry

00:24:09.380 --> 00:24:13.214
takes place that ultimately that
leads to the planetary system

00:24:13.214 --> 00:24:14.005
that we know today.

00:24:18.940 --> 00:24:21.370
We really see this
process playing out

00:24:21.370 --> 00:24:24.400
hundreds of different times
right now in our own galaxy,

00:24:24.400 --> 00:24:27.400
in nearby star-forming
regions, and very consistent

00:24:27.400 --> 00:24:29.620
with what we know about
our own solar system.

00:24:29.620 --> 00:24:32.320
All of the planets line
up in a nice plane.

00:24:32.320 --> 00:24:35.470
They're all revolving around
the sun in the same direction.

00:24:35.470 --> 00:24:38.020
Most of them are even
rotating about their axis

00:24:38.020 --> 00:24:39.340
in the same direction.

00:24:39.340 --> 00:24:41.320
It's pretty clear
the planets are

00:24:41.320 --> 00:24:43.690
carrying, even today,
all of the angular

00:24:43.690 --> 00:24:45.130
momentum in the solar system.

00:24:45.130 --> 00:24:46.450
The sun has all the mass.

00:24:46.450 --> 00:24:49.510
More than 99% of the mass
ends up in that star,

00:24:49.510 --> 00:24:51.310
creating that giant
nuclear furnace.

00:24:51.310 --> 00:24:51.940
But that's OK.

00:24:51.940 --> 00:24:52.898
We don't need too much.

00:24:52.898 --> 00:24:55.900
The 1% is all we need to get by.

00:24:55.900 --> 00:24:56.675
We are the 1%.

00:25:03.070 --> 00:25:05.960
Let's take a look
inside this cloud.

00:25:05.960 --> 00:25:09.851
And we do know that there
are weather storms going on

00:25:09.851 --> 00:25:10.350
in here.

00:25:10.350 --> 00:25:12.360
You've got all kinds of
flash heating events.

00:25:12.360 --> 00:25:15.420
We see those in our chondrules.

00:25:15.420 --> 00:25:17.940
A lot of these clips
are from NASA Goddard

00:25:17.940 --> 00:25:19.610
and a collaboration
that I did with them

00:25:19.610 --> 00:25:23.400
to tell the story of the early
solar system and the asteroid

00:25:23.400 --> 00:25:24.690
that we're interested in.

00:25:24.690 --> 00:25:27.450
And I was so excited because
for the first time ever,

00:25:27.450 --> 00:25:30.360
we animated the process
of chondrule formation.

00:25:30.360 --> 00:25:32.040
Bear with me.

00:25:32.040 --> 00:25:35.310
What you have is you have
dust bunnies, fine grain dust

00:25:35.310 --> 00:25:39.300
particles, that stick together
in the early solar system.

00:25:39.300 --> 00:25:42.630
Then these shock waves come
ripping through the gas

00:25:42.630 --> 00:25:45.630
and they flash heat these
things to thousands of degrees,

00:25:45.630 --> 00:25:48.250
so fast that they create
these molten droplets.

00:25:48.250 --> 00:25:50.910
And this process played
out billions of times,

00:25:50.910 --> 00:25:53.580
basically creating
little space marbles

00:25:53.580 --> 00:25:55.150
that were igneous systems.

00:25:55.150 --> 00:25:59.040
These were molten drops of rock
and they slowly crystallize

00:25:59.040 --> 00:26:01.410
and those are the building
blocks of planets.

00:26:01.410 --> 00:26:03.420
They grow into
asteroid sized objects,

00:26:03.420 --> 00:26:05.170
they grow into
mountain-sized objects,

00:26:05.170 --> 00:26:10.150
and ultimately they grow
into planet-sized objects.

00:26:10.150 --> 00:26:12.530
The chondrules were like that
necessary little stepping

00:26:12.530 --> 00:26:13.030
stone.

00:26:13.030 --> 00:26:15.250
You had to take the dust,
you had to flash heat it,

00:26:15.250 --> 00:26:17.320
you had to accrete
the pebbles together,

00:26:17.320 --> 00:26:18.904
and we still have
those samples today.

00:26:18.904 --> 00:26:21.361
And every once in a while, I
forget about that, because you

00:26:21.361 --> 00:26:22.150
get kind of jaded.

00:26:22.150 --> 00:26:24.310
But you stop and you
sit there and you think,

00:26:24.310 --> 00:26:28.240
I'm holding a rock that
is older than this planet.

00:26:28.240 --> 00:26:31.930
It's the very first thing that
formed that led to the pathway

00:26:31.930 --> 00:26:33.730
to planet formation.

00:26:33.730 --> 00:26:35.890
This is a really
good thing, right?

00:26:35.890 --> 00:26:37.990
Well, yes and no.

00:26:37.990 --> 00:26:40.660
That process plays
out, the earth forms.

00:26:40.660 --> 00:26:41.440
We think OK.

00:26:41.440 --> 00:26:43.731
Well, we're on a pretty good
path to forming life here.

00:26:43.731 --> 00:26:47.110
But something odd happened
in the solar system

00:26:47.110 --> 00:26:51.310
about 500 million years
after the planets formed.

00:26:51.310 --> 00:26:54.010
Something triggered
this giant migration

00:26:54.010 --> 00:26:57.250
of the same objects that
built our planets back

00:26:57.250 --> 00:26:59.110
into the inner solar system.

00:26:59.110 --> 00:27:01.690
We actually think this
was due to Jupiter

00:27:01.690 --> 00:27:04.360
being kind of unstable,
and it was slowly

00:27:04.360 --> 00:27:06.130
interacting with
Saturn, and then

00:27:06.130 --> 00:27:07.780
they hit a critical resonance.

00:27:07.780 --> 00:27:10.960
Jupiter got pushed in, so we
think it formed out farther

00:27:10.960 --> 00:27:13.840
than it is now, and
then it swung in closer

00:27:13.840 --> 00:27:15.310
to the inner solar system.

00:27:15.310 --> 00:27:17.740
And it's the most
massive object that we

00:27:17.740 --> 00:27:20.440
have except for the sun,
so it has a really strong

00:27:20.440 --> 00:27:22.180
gravitational influence.

00:27:22.180 --> 00:27:25.180
It basically acted like a
plow-- its gravity field

00:27:25.180 --> 00:27:28.870
pushed through the asteroid
belt and flung thousands

00:27:28.870 --> 00:27:31.390
of these objects into
the inner solar system,

00:27:31.390 --> 00:27:33.370
creating this
period that we call

00:27:33.370 --> 00:27:36.370
the late heavy bombardment.

00:27:36.370 --> 00:27:39.130
Our planet might have been a
really nice, habitable place

00:27:39.130 --> 00:27:42.220
with oceans and organisms
that had originated and were

00:27:42.220 --> 00:27:45.220
thriving and living
for 500 million years.

00:27:45.220 --> 00:27:48.310
And then sure enough,
thousands of giant impacts

00:27:48.310 --> 00:27:51.190
started raining down on
the planetary surface.

00:27:51.190 --> 00:27:54.250
Pretty much sterilizing
the entire planet,

00:27:54.250 --> 00:27:57.550
evaporating the oceans,
stripping away the atmosphere,

00:27:57.550 --> 00:28:00.040
in a period we call
the Hadean, because we

00:28:00.040 --> 00:28:04.240
think it was a hot, hellish
environment that anything

00:28:04.240 --> 00:28:07.810
would be extremely unlikely
to have survived in.

00:28:07.810 --> 00:28:09.940
Now we ask our
questions, well, we're

00:28:09.940 --> 00:28:13.300
here, so we know this late
heavy bombardment happened,

00:28:13.300 --> 00:28:17.420
we can see it expressed in the
cratering record of our moon.

00:28:17.420 --> 00:28:20.830
And in fact, we have a
really good correlation

00:28:20.830 --> 00:28:23.320
between the crater
population on the moon

00:28:23.320 --> 00:28:26.470
and the size distribution of the
asteroids in the asteroid belt.

00:28:26.470 --> 00:28:28.374
That's some research
that was done here

00:28:28.374 --> 00:28:30.790
in my home department, the
Lunar and Planetary laboratory,

00:28:30.790 --> 00:28:32.860
by one of our other
faculty members.

00:28:32.860 --> 00:28:36.280
We know there was this giant
flux of asteroids that smashed

00:28:36.280 --> 00:28:37.720
into the surface of the moon.

00:28:37.720 --> 00:28:40.090
Anything that hit the moon,
10 times as many of those

00:28:40.090 --> 00:28:41.890
would have hit the
surface of the earth.

00:28:41.890 --> 00:28:46.060
So we're left with
this molten environment

00:28:46.060 --> 00:28:49.180
It's somehow, right
after that period,

00:28:49.180 --> 00:28:53.400
we see the first signs of
life showing up on our planet.

00:28:53.400 --> 00:28:54.300
Is it a coincidence?

00:28:54.300 --> 00:28:56.700
It might be, but it
seems like as soon

00:28:56.700 --> 00:28:59.490
as that flux of
massive impactors

00:28:59.490 --> 00:29:02.460
ended their reign of terror
on the surface of the Earth,

00:29:02.460 --> 00:29:05.010
life showed up.

00:29:05.010 --> 00:29:07.440
Either it's somehow survived,
and that's a possibility,

00:29:07.440 --> 00:29:10.530
and people explore where would
have been a safe enclave.

00:29:10.530 --> 00:29:12.659
Where could life have
survived this process,

00:29:12.659 --> 00:29:14.700
a safe harbor that it
could have been crawled out

00:29:14.700 --> 00:29:16.350
from afterwards?

00:29:16.350 --> 00:29:19.650
Or did, in addition to
reigning that destruction down

00:29:19.650 --> 00:29:22.650
on our planet, did
those same objects also

00:29:22.650 --> 00:29:27.150
bring in the seeds
of life with them?

00:29:27.150 --> 00:29:30.930
One idea, and a very
famous one, coming out

00:29:30.930 --> 00:29:34.260
of an experiment called
the Miller Urey experiment,

00:29:34.260 --> 00:29:37.140
says those objects
probably would

00:29:37.140 --> 00:29:40.920
have ended up bringing in a lot
of what we call reducing gases.

00:29:40.920 --> 00:29:43.170
In chemistry, we like to
think about reductions

00:29:43.170 --> 00:29:45.032
and oxidations.

00:29:45.032 --> 00:29:46.740
When you oxidize
something, you can think

00:29:46.740 --> 00:29:47.980
of like burning something.

00:29:47.980 --> 00:29:49.650
You're stripping away electrons.

00:29:49.650 --> 00:29:53.274
You're reacting with oxygen.
But in a reducing environment,

00:29:53.274 --> 00:29:55.440
you wouldn't have the
atmosphere that we have today.

00:29:55.440 --> 00:29:59.960
You would have nitrogen,
you might have some water,

00:29:59.960 --> 00:30:03.600
you might have methane,
the hydrocarbon, ammonia--

00:30:03.600 --> 00:30:05.910
which is key to
those amino acids,

00:30:05.910 --> 00:30:08.340
that's where those words
are linked together.

00:30:08.340 --> 00:30:10.590
So if you had methane,
and you had ammonia,

00:30:10.590 --> 00:30:13.680
and you had some water, and
then you had an lightning storm,

00:30:13.680 --> 00:30:17.310
say, Stanley Miller
and Harold Urey

00:30:17.310 --> 00:30:20.400
showed that lightning strikes
through such an atmosphere

00:30:20.400 --> 00:30:23.310
would actually generate a lot
of really interesting chemistry.

00:30:23.310 --> 00:30:26.610
In fact, it would generate
amino acids and nucleic acids

00:30:26.610 --> 00:30:30.090
and stuff that we need to build
those critical biomolecules

00:30:30.090 --> 00:30:31.680
moving forward.

00:30:31.680 --> 00:30:33.630
For a long time,
we said, OK, fine,

00:30:33.630 --> 00:30:36.570
all you need are those simple
gases and some weather,

00:30:36.570 --> 00:30:40.320
and you can create the basic
building blocks of life.

00:30:40.320 --> 00:30:42.820
But we've really dived
into this problem.

00:30:42.820 --> 00:30:45.540
We've looked at the geologic
record from this era

00:30:45.540 --> 00:30:47.250
and it turns out, it
doesn't look like we

00:30:47.250 --> 00:30:49.300
had that reducing atmosphere.

00:30:49.300 --> 00:30:51.750
Instead, it looks like we
had more neutral conditions.

00:30:51.750 --> 00:30:53.990
We had nitrogen and noble gases.

00:30:53.990 --> 00:30:56.490
Things that aren't really going
to react even in a lightning

00:30:56.490 --> 00:30:57.610
strike.

00:30:57.610 --> 00:31:00.390
And so that put us back
a step, and we said, OK,

00:31:00.390 --> 00:31:03.450
we have to think about, if
it's not coming from weather

00:31:03.450 --> 00:31:06.210
and energy in our atmosphere
reacting with that very

00:31:06.210 --> 00:31:07.890
different composition,
how are we

00:31:07.890 --> 00:31:11.190
going to make these key
compounds that go on to build

00:31:11.190 --> 00:31:13.490
our critical biomolecules?

00:31:13.490 --> 00:31:15.600
I would say, there are
places in the solar system

00:31:15.600 --> 00:31:17.280
where this could be happening.

00:31:17.280 --> 00:31:20.760
We look at Titan, a
famous moon of Saturn,

00:31:20.760 --> 00:31:24.090
and it is draped in a nice
nitrogen-rich atmosphere,

00:31:24.090 --> 00:31:25.350
very much like the Earth.

00:31:25.350 --> 00:31:26.990
But it also has
a lot of methane,

00:31:26.990 --> 00:31:28.830
a very reducing composition.

00:31:28.830 --> 00:31:30.490
It also has lakes and oceans.

00:31:30.490 --> 00:31:33.480
And so, you'll hear
more about those kinds

00:31:33.480 --> 00:31:37.920
of environments in one of the
future lectures in the series.

00:31:37.920 --> 00:31:39.480
The other thing we
look at is to say,

00:31:39.480 --> 00:31:42.480
we have a geologically
active planet.

00:31:42.480 --> 00:31:45.390
We know we must have gotten
this water pretty early on,

00:31:45.390 --> 00:31:47.590
and that most likely
came from the asteroids.

00:31:47.590 --> 00:31:50.010
A lot of these
asteroids are hydrated.

00:31:50.010 --> 00:31:52.560
And that doesn't mean they have
liquid water floating around

00:31:52.560 --> 00:31:54.870
them now, but they did at
some point in the past,

00:31:54.870 --> 00:31:58.080
and that water reacted with the
rocks and made clay particles.

00:31:58.080 --> 00:32:00.930
And clays have water in
their crystal structures.

00:32:00.930 --> 00:32:03.930
So you bring those clays
in, they melt and evaporate

00:32:03.930 --> 00:32:07.740
in those giant impacts and you
can get a nice liquid ocean

00:32:07.740 --> 00:32:09.592
like we have today.

00:32:09.592 --> 00:32:11.550
The other thing we have
going on in this planet

00:32:11.550 --> 00:32:14.490
is a process called
plate tectonics.

00:32:14.490 --> 00:32:17.550
We've got ocean centers
that are spreading.

00:32:17.550 --> 00:32:19.740
New oceanic crust is forming.

00:32:19.740 --> 00:32:21.900
Old oceanic crust
is subducting down

00:32:21.900 --> 00:32:24.867
and the whole crust is getting
recycled over and over again.

00:32:24.867 --> 00:32:26.700
You probably didn't
have a lot of continents

00:32:26.700 --> 00:32:30.240
at this very early stage, but
you certainly had oceanic crust

00:32:30.240 --> 00:32:33.390
and you probably had
spreading centers,

00:32:33.390 --> 00:32:36.079
where magma was reaching up
to the bottom of the ocean.

00:32:36.079 --> 00:32:38.370
Well, it turns out, that
drives some pretty interesting

00:32:38.370 --> 00:32:41.530
processes, because that water
just doesn't stay at the top,

00:32:41.530 --> 00:32:44.100
it actually penetrates
deep down into the rocks.

00:32:44.100 --> 00:32:46.230
It interacts with
that hot magma.

00:32:46.230 --> 00:32:49.140
It boils away and
it comes gushing out

00:32:49.140 --> 00:32:52.530
through what we call these
black smoker hydrothermal vents

00:32:52.530 --> 00:32:55.070
at the bottom of the ocean.

00:32:55.070 --> 00:32:57.100
The reason that they're
black, by the way,

00:32:57.100 --> 00:32:59.430
is because they have
lots of sulfide minerals.

00:32:59.430 --> 00:33:00.930
That's pretty interesting.

00:33:00.930 --> 00:33:02.820
It's interesting to me,
I wrote my PhD thesis

00:33:02.820 --> 00:33:03.710
on sulfide minerals.

00:33:03.710 --> 00:33:06.780
But it's interesting
in the broader picture

00:33:06.780 --> 00:33:08.940
as well, because
sulfide minerals

00:33:08.940 --> 00:33:11.340
tend to be really good
catalytic surfaces.

00:33:11.340 --> 00:33:14.310
They let chemical reactions
happen that wouldn't otherwise

00:33:14.310 --> 00:33:16.260
happen if they weren't there.

00:33:16.260 --> 00:33:18.960
Now, you've got all of
this fine grained sulfide

00:33:18.960 --> 00:33:21.000
material coming out of
these hydrothermal vents.

00:33:21.000 --> 00:33:22.830
You've got liquid water.

00:33:22.830 --> 00:33:25.170
And it's thought that
this might be a great site

00:33:25.170 --> 00:33:27.300
to catalyze some of
those important reactions

00:33:27.300 --> 00:33:29.910
and get the amino acids going.

00:33:29.910 --> 00:33:31.690
That's still a
reasonable hypothesis.

00:33:31.690 --> 00:33:34.260
The other thought is
that maybe life even

00:33:34.260 --> 00:33:37.380
originated before that
late heavy bombardment

00:33:37.380 --> 00:33:40.020
and then it was able to hide
out in these hydrothermal vents.

00:33:40.020 --> 00:33:41.790
And we go down in
our submersibles

00:33:41.790 --> 00:33:43.725
and we look around at
these environments,

00:33:43.725 --> 00:33:45.970
and we see they're
teeming with life.

00:33:45.970 --> 00:33:47.850
This is miles down the
bottom of the ocean

00:33:47.850 --> 00:33:49.410
where no sunlight is reaching.

00:33:49.410 --> 00:33:51.870
These are not relying on
photosynthesis or plants

00:33:51.870 --> 00:33:54.430
or algae for their
prime energy source.

00:33:54.430 --> 00:33:56.310
They're eating the rocks.

00:33:56.310 --> 00:34:00.810
They're living on the chemical
energy of these systems.

00:34:00.810 --> 00:34:04.980
When we go back to LUCA, our
last universal common ancestor,

00:34:04.980 --> 00:34:07.170
we actually say it
looks like it might

00:34:07.170 --> 00:34:10.590
be what we call a
thermaphile, which means it

00:34:10.590 --> 00:34:12.179
likes really hot temperatures.

00:34:12.179 --> 00:34:14.159
We find lots of
thermaphiles coming out

00:34:14.159 --> 00:34:17.280
of these black smoker vents
at the bottom of the ocean.

00:34:17.280 --> 00:34:22.420
This might be where
our ancestor grew up.

00:34:22.420 --> 00:34:26.350
But the other option is
that the asteroids that

00:34:26.350 --> 00:34:29.110
brought in the death and
destruction that sterilized

00:34:29.110 --> 00:34:34.389
the service of the planet also
brought rebirth and a new start

00:34:34.389 --> 00:34:35.830
on life.

00:34:35.830 --> 00:34:38.560
Here's a different
meteorite, a different kind

00:34:38.560 --> 00:34:41.332
of carbonaceous chondrite.

00:34:41.332 --> 00:34:43.540
Similar to the one I showed
you before-- you can even

00:34:43.540 --> 00:34:46.510
see some of the white
inclusions that are in there.

00:34:46.510 --> 00:34:48.905
We've spent a lot of time
picking through these rocks.

00:34:48.905 --> 00:34:51.280
I look at the chondrules, I
look at the sulfide minerals.

00:34:51.280 --> 00:34:54.314
But I'm also really interested
in, where's the carbon?

00:34:54.314 --> 00:34:55.480
That's what we want to know.

00:34:55.480 --> 00:34:57.850
We have a hard time
making carbon minerals

00:34:57.850 --> 00:34:59.292
in the early solar system.

00:34:59.292 --> 00:35:01.375
Carbon can be stable at
really high temperatures--

00:35:01.375 --> 00:35:05.110
you've probably seen graphite
used as a furnace rods

00:35:05.110 --> 00:35:07.600
or for high temperature
heating, but that

00:35:07.600 --> 00:35:09.160
doesn't work in
our solar system,

00:35:09.160 --> 00:35:12.970
because we have too
much oxygen around.

00:35:12.970 --> 00:35:15.910
Oxygen likes to grab that
carbon and make gas molecules

00:35:15.910 --> 00:35:18.610
like carbon monoxide
and carbon dioxide.

00:35:18.610 --> 00:35:20.980
We see carbon way out
in the outer reaches

00:35:20.980 --> 00:35:23.462
of our solar system
on the icy planets,

00:35:23.462 --> 00:35:25.420
but we don't see a lot
of it in our meteorites,

00:35:25.420 --> 00:35:27.310
except these carbonaceous
chondrites might

00:35:27.310 --> 00:35:30.790
have a few weight percent
carbon inside of them.

00:35:30.790 --> 00:35:33.220
People, even 60
years ago, started

00:35:33.220 --> 00:35:34.750
looking at these
things, and they

00:35:34.750 --> 00:35:38.620
found some really interesting
compounds, like amino acids

00:35:38.620 --> 00:35:40.690
and sugars and alcohols.

00:35:40.690 --> 00:35:43.075
We went in and we
found similar things.

00:35:45.880 --> 00:35:48.260
We found lots of
different amino acids.

00:35:48.260 --> 00:35:50.830
This actually here is the
chemical structure for one

00:35:50.830 --> 00:35:52.954
we call isovaline.

00:35:52.954 --> 00:35:54.370
You've probably
never heard of it,

00:35:54.370 --> 00:35:57.730
because it's not one of
the 20 or 22 amino acids

00:35:57.730 --> 00:36:01.060
that our bodies use
to build proteins.

00:36:01.060 --> 00:36:02.710
In fact, that's the
reason we study it,

00:36:02.710 --> 00:36:05.620
because we don't have to worry
about it being contaminated

00:36:05.620 --> 00:36:07.570
by biological organisms.

00:36:07.570 --> 00:36:09.700
It turns out, not only
do meteorite scientists

00:36:09.700 --> 00:36:12.147
like these rocks, but
bacteria like them as well.

00:36:12.147 --> 00:36:14.230
As soon as they get onto
the surface of the Earth,

00:36:14.230 --> 00:36:16.560
they're immediately
colonized by bacteria,

00:36:16.560 --> 00:36:19.000
who start to eat away all
of the great scientific data

00:36:19.000 --> 00:36:20.299
that's inside of them.

00:36:20.299 --> 00:36:22.840
We're rushing against them to
try to get that information out

00:36:22.840 --> 00:36:25.080
before it's all gone.

00:36:25.080 --> 00:36:26.830
We can go in and we
can say, well, they're

00:36:26.830 --> 00:36:28.800
not going to eat
isovaline, because they

00:36:28.800 --> 00:36:30.380
can't use it to make proteins.

00:36:30.380 --> 00:36:34.240
So we can study it and we can
try to understand its chemical

00:36:34.240 --> 00:36:35.650
properties.

00:36:35.650 --> 00:36:40.030
And it turns out, when you look
at proteins and amino acids,

00:36:40.030 --> 00:36:42.460
there's two different versions
of the same amino acid,

00:36:42.460 --> 00:36:44.350
isovaline has a
right-handed version

00:36:44.350 --> 00:36:46.520
and it has a
left-handed version.

00:36:46.520 --> 00:36:48.820
We call this enantiomers
of each other, which

00:36:48.820 --> 00:36:51.310
means they're
chemically identical,

00:36:51.310 --> 00:36:53.320
but they're just mirror
images of each other.

00:36:53.320 --> 00:36:55.480
You can't look on the back
side, and it won't-- it'll look

00:36:55.480 --> 00:36:57.979
different, because of the way
that atoms are arranged inside

00:36:57.979 --> 00:36:58.850
of there.

00:36:58.850 --> 00:37:00.790
When we look at the
amino acids that

00:37:00.790 --> 00:37:03.190
are in our proteins
in our bodies,

00:37:03.190 --> 00:37:07.450
life exclusively uses the
left-handed amino acids.

00:37:07.450 --> 00:37:10.960
No right-handed people allowed,
no right-handed proteins

00:37:10.960 --> 00:37:13.150
allowed, all of your
proteins are sinister.

00:37:18.124 --> 00:37:19.790
We say, well, that's
pretty interesting.

00:37:19.790 --> 00:37:22.640
What if we look at the
enantiomeric distribution

00:37:22.640 --> 00:37:25.950
of these non-biologic amino
acids in the carbonaceous

00:37:25.950 --> 00:37:26.450
chondrites?

00:37:26.450 --> 00:37:28.033
We know they came
from the meteorites,

00:37:28.033 --> 00:37:31.100
we know the meteorite
came from outer space.

00:37:31.100 --> 00:37:33.020
And so it turns
out, when we look--

00:37:33.020 --> 00:37:35.160
we looked at a whole
range of these rocks.

00:37:35.160 --> 00:37:37.610
Many of them which had
been altered by that water

00:37:37.610 --> 00:37:39.350
that I talked about,
ice had probably

00:37:39.350 --> 00:37:41.930
accreted into the asteroid
early in its history,

00:37:41.930 --> 00:37:44.030
and then melted and
changed the chemistry

00:37:44.030 --> 00:37:46.100
and the mineralogy quite a bit.

00:37:46.100 --> 00:37:49.250
But when we look at the ones
that have no or minimal water

00:37:49.250 --> 00:37:53.570
exposure, we see that there
is an excess of about 60%--

00:37:53.570 --> 00:37:58.975
out of 260 molecules, 160 would
be left-handed and 100 would be

00:37:58.975 --> 00:37:59.840
right-handed.

00:37:59.840 --> 00:38:02.810
That's pretty interesting,
because now we say, well, we

00:38:02.810 --> 00:38:06.350
know that these rocks are
falling on the earth today.

00:38:06.350 --> 00:38:08.730
We know these rocks are
4.5 billion years old.

00:38:08.730 --> 00:38:10.550
So they were certainly
falling on the earth

00:38:10.550 --> 00:38:13.580
3.8 or 4 billion years ago when
that late heavy bombardment was

00:38:13.580 --> 00:38:14.690
winding down.

00:38:14.690 --> 00:38:18.710
And they're bringing in a
handedness to the molecules

00:38:18.710 --> 00:38:20.930
that life seems to prefer.

00:38:20.930 --> 00:38:23.330
I think you can make
a really strong case

00:38:23.330 --> 00:38:26.000
that the origin
of life was likely

00:38:26.000 --> 00:38:28.340
catalyzed by these
objects falling

00:38:28.340 --> 00:38:30.680
onto the surface of our planet.

00:38:30.680 --> 00:38:33.020
But then you've got to put
all the pieces together.

00:38:33.020 --> 00:38:36.200
And I want to bring us back now
to that element phosphorous,

00:38:36.200 --> 00:38:39.350
because that's the one
that's really tricky.

00:38:39.350 --> 00:38:42.170
Some of the work that I
did early on in my career

00:38:42.170 --> 00:38:45.530
here in the early 2000s
through about 2006

00:38:45.530 --> 00:38:48.680
really focused on this process.

00:38:48.680 --> 00:38:50.780
We found something
really, I thought,

00:38:50.780 --> 00:38:53.210
amazing-- it was one of those
great moments in science

00:38:53.210 --> 00:38:55.310
where you do a very
simple experiment

00:38:55.310 --> 00:38:57.365
and the results are
profound, and you

00:38:57.365 --> 00:38:59.935
know your career has been
worth it up to that point.

00:38:59.935 --> 00:39:02.060
We've been looking in those
carbonaceous chondrites

00:39:02.060 --> 00:39:04.790
for a long time, because we know
there's amino acids in there,

00:39:04.790 --> 00:39:08.360
there's sugars in there,
there's nucleic acids in there,

00:39:08.360 --> 00:39:11.000
and if we could just
find this phosphorus,

00:39:11.000 --> 00:39:13.620
we could think about how
we're going to make that DNA,

00:39:13.620 --> 00:39:15.820
because DNA needs
the phosphorus.

00:39:15.820 --> 00:39:17.150
It in fact makes the backbone.

00:39:17.150 --> 00:39:19.640
When you see that
double helix of DNA,

00:39:19.640 --> 00:39:23.240
the spine on either side of
it is a sugar phosphate chain,

00:39:23.240 --> 00:39:25.250
and the nucleic acids
hang off the side of that,

00:39:25.250 --> 00:39:28.130
and that's where the information
is to code your proteins.

00:39:28.130 --> 00:39:30.260
But all of the
minerals that contain

00:39:30.260 --> 00:39:34.324
phosphorus in the carbonaceous
chondrites were really boring.

00:39:34.324 --> 00:39:35.990
They didn't want to
react with anything.

00:39:35.990 --> 00:39:38.156
We were trying to put him
through all these chemical

00:39:38.156 --> 00:39:40.352
processes, the same
processes that we

00:39:40.352 --> 00:39:41.810
think are altering
the amino acids,

00:39:41.810 --> 00:39:43.101
and they're just sitting there.

00:39:43.101 --> 00:39:44.354
And they're not changing.

00:39:44.354 --> 00:39:45.770
And my graduate
student's starting

00:39:45.770 --> 00:39:48.770
to get desperate-- just
give me a thesis topic,

00:39:48.770 --> 00:39:50.420
I'll do anything.

00:39:50.420 --> 00:39:52.889
And I said, well, a
lot of different things

00:39:52.889 --> 00:39:53.930
are falling on the earth.

00:39:53.930 --> 00:39:55.388
Maybe we're thinking
too much about

00:39:55.388 --> 00:39:57.080
these carbonaceous chondrites.

00:39:57.080 --> 00:39:58.970
And I said, there's
some pretty interesting

00:39:58.970 --> 00:40:01.000
phosphorous minerals
in iron meteorites.

00:40:01.000 --> 00:40:03.054
Here, you're looking at
a slab of iron meteorite.

00:40:03.054 --> 00:40:04.220
I could hold it in my hands.

00:40:04.220 --> 00:40:07.100
It's about five or six
inches across here.

00:40:07.100 --> 00:40:12.080
I said, look at this shooting
star right here in the slab.

00:40:12.080 --> 00:40:14.324
This is a mineral we
call schreibersite,

00:40:14.324 --> 00:40:15.740
it's a phosphorus-bearing
mineral,

00:40:15.740 --> 00:40:19.040
but unlike the phosphates, which
are the most abundant phase

00:40:19.040 --> 00:40:20.510
in you're carbonaceous
chondrites,

00:40:20.510 --> 00:40:24.990
these are a phosphide,
very different chemistry.

00:40:24.990 --> 00:40:29.817
Here, you've got Fe3P,
no oxygen around,

00:40:29.817 --> 00:40:32.400
and I said, well, you know iron
meteorites, when they come in,

00:40:32.400 --> 00:40:33.600
they come in big.

00:40:33.600 --> 00:40:36.294
We've got iron meteorites that
are 60 tons in size sitting

00:40:36.294 --> 00:40:37.460
on the surface of the Earth.

00:40:37.460 --> 00:40:39.600
There's a lot of
these guys, and these

00:40:39.600 --> 00:40:41.910
are coming from
the ancient cores

00:40:41.910 --> 00:40:43.560
of differentiated planets.

00:40:43.560 --> 00:40:46.320
Basically, you had an asteroid
they got big enough that

00:40:46.320 --> 00:40:49.330
completely melted, and
all of the iron and nickel

00:40:49.330 --> 00:40:51.960
and phosphorous and other
metals sank to the center,

00:40:51.960 --> 00:40:54.090
and all of the oxygen
and magnesium and silicon

00:40:54.090 --> 00:40:56.760
that make up most of the
rocks stayed in the mantle

00:40:56.760 --> 00:40:59.530
or even erupted as
volcanoes onto the crust.

00:40:59.530 --> 00:41:01.190
I said, but these
guys get shattered

00:41:01.190 --> 00:41:03.780
in giant catastrophic
collisions in the asteroid belt

00:41:03.780 --> 00:41:06.120
and they come raining
down onto the planet

00:41:06.120 --> 00:41:08.220
just like the carbonaceous
chondrites do.

00:41:08.220 --> 00:41:10.050
And I bet something
pretty interesting

00:41:10.050 --> 00:41:13.950
happens when a reduced
phase like that hits water.

00:41:13.950 --> 00:41:17.100
We saw-- like I said,
one of the great moments

00:41:17.100 --> 00:41:19.950
of my scientific career-- a
very, very simple experiment,

00:41:19.950 --> 00:41:23.190
take iron phosphite and
drop it in a glass of water,

00:41:23.190 --> 00:41:24.584
and come back in
a couple of days

00:41:24.584 --> 00:41:27.000
and run it through some fancy
chemical analysis equipment.

00:41:27.000 --> 00:41:30.420
And we say, over here
there are the phosphates.

00:41:30.420 --> 00:41:33.914
These are the kinds of things
that make up our DNA and RNA,

00:41:33.914 --> 00:41:35.830
and this is what the
minerals are made out of.

00:41:35.830 --> 00:41:38.970
And this guy, you can see, it's
the end of this reaction chain.

00:41:38.970 --> 00:41:40.890
We were trying to
start here, and we

00:41:40.890 --> 00:41:45.000
wanted things like this
triphosphonate is like ATP.

00:41:45.000 --> 00:41:47.430
This is your energy
source in your cells here.

00:41:47.430 --> 00:41:50.250
We couldn't get these reactions
to go this way or over here,

00:41:50.250 --> 00:41:53.940
so you could start adding more
interesting chemical compounds

00:41:53.940 --> 00:41:55.680
like nucleic acids to them.

00:41:55.680 --> 00:41:58.140
Well, turns out, when
you've got a metal that's

00:41:58.140 --> 00:42:01.650
an oxidation state of 0 and
phosphates sitting over here

00:42:01.650 --> 00:42:05.280
at plus 5, and so, you don't
make this immediate leap

00:42:05.280 --> 00:42:06.540
over here to phosphate.

00:42:06.540 --> 00:42:10.620
In fact, you go to plus 3 and
you make this phosphonate.

00:42:10.620 --> 00:42:13.890
What's important here is, you
see the phosphorus is purple

00:42:13.890 --> 00:42:17.349
and the oxygen is red, all
of your phosphorus bonds--

00:42:17.349 --> 00:42:19.140
there's five of them,
there's a double bond

00:42:19.140 --> 00:42:22.170
there-- all of the phosphorus
bonds are taken up by oxygen,

00:42:22.170 --> 00:42:24.600
so nothing else interesting
is going to happen there.

00:42:24.600 --> 00:42:27.150
Over here, you've got a bond
with this white ball, which

00:42:27.150 --> 00:42:29.250
is hydrogen, and
that can go on and do

00:42:29.250 --> 00:42:31.050
all kinds of cool things.

00:42:31.050 --> 00:42:33.390
Turns out, you can't just
jump over here to the plus 4,

00:42:33.390 --> 00:42:36.060
you need to bring two
of these guys together.

00:42:36.060 --> 00:42:37.830
And then you can
do a back reaction.

00:42:37.830 --> 00:42:39.580
And then you can get
all the way down here

00:42:39.580 --> 00:42:41.160
to this triphosphonate.

00:42:41.160 --> 00:42:43.860
So I said, I think this is
something really important.

00:42:43.860 --> 00:42:46.380
Matt Pasic was my graduate
student who worked on this.

00:42:46.380 --> 00:42:48.630
We published this paper in 2005.

00:42:48.630 --> 00:42:51.570
And he's made his career
on this discipline now.

00:42:51.570 --> 00:42:54.630
He's studying how reduced
phosphorus minerals

00:42:54.630 --> 00:42:56.760
may have contributed
to the origin of life.

00:42:56.760 --> 00:42:58.110
Going on for a decade now.

00:42:58.110 --> 00:43:00.330
He's been very successful at it.

00:43:00.330 --> 00:43:02.040
Really exciting.

00:43:02.040 --> 00:43:04.110
Kind of a hybrid model.

00:43:04.110 --> 00:43:07.260
We think the nucleic
acids and the amino acids

00:43:07.260 --> 00:43:09.750
probably came in the
carbonaceous chondrites,

00:43:09.750 --> 00:43:12.090
but then you had to have
this giant iron meteorite

00:43:12.090 --> 00:43:14.479
land in an aqueous environment.

00:43:14.479 --> 00:43:16.020
And the good news
is, because they're

00:43:16.020 --> 00:43:19.560
so big they corrode
away very slowly.

00:43:19.560 --> 00:43:22.500
Iron meteorites might be around
for hundreds of thousands

00:43:22.500 --> 00:43:23.520
of years.

00:43:23.520 --> 00:43:25.830
You've got this
nice, steady supply

00:43:25.830 --> 00:43:28.770
of highly reactive phosphorus
compounds coming out

00:43:28.770 --> 00:43:31.680
into your aqueous system, maybe
even those hydrothermal vents,

00:43:31.680 --> 00:43:33.750
where they can
participate in that party,

00:43:33.750 --> 00:43:35.730
and get going with
those sulfide minerals,

00:43:35.730 --> 00:43:38.580
and create all the
interesting chemistry that's

00:43:38.580 --> 00:43:41.640
going to lead to biomolecules.

00:43:41.640 --> 00:43:46.230
What we've got here is, going
back to getting to LUCA,

00:43:46.230 --> 00:43:49.380
we know we can start out
with these interesting small

00:43:49.380 --> 00:43:49.890
compounds.

00:43:49.890 --> 00:43:54.140
Here is the nucleic
acids that make up RNA.

00:43:54.140 --> 00:43:56.900
We can go ahead and
bring in those phosphates

00:43:56.900 --> 00:43:58.910
and through these
aqueous reactions

00:43:58.910 --> 00:44:00.830
get our sugar
phosphate background.

00:44:00.830 --> 00:44:03.600
And now you've got an
information-bearing molecule.

00:44:03.600 --> 00:44:05.780
So we've got a long way
towards the origin of life.

00:44:05.780 --> 00:44:08.660
And then ultimately, we've got
to make this step to a living

00:44:08.660 --> 00:44:12.590
cell, and I'll admit we
haven't got there yet.

00:44:12.590 --> 00:44:15.080
We haven't had an
independent origin

00:44:15.080 --> 00:44:17.370
of life in our
laboratories on earth yet.

00:44:17.370 --> 00:44:21.070
But I don't think
that's too far away.

00:44:21.070 --> 00:44:23.380
It's still one of the
great mysteries of science,

00:44:23.380 --> 00:44:25.780
and it's still driving
a lot of what we do.

00:44:25.780 --> 00:44:27.850
In fact, we are a
little bit frustrated

00:44:27.850 --> 00:44:29.050
with the meteorite analysis.

00:44:29.050 --> 00:44:31.760
I mentioned those bacteria
getting in my rocks,

00:44:31.760 --> 00:44:33.520
ruining a lot of stuff.

00:44:33.520 --> 00:44:35.770
So I said, fine,
I'm going to go out

00:44:35.770 --> 00:44:37.270
and I'm going to
get some of my own,

00:44:37.270 --> 00:44:39.610
and you're not going to be
allowed to play with it.

00:44:42.450 --> 00:44:47.550
I think we can really say
that this life on earth

00:44:47.550 --> 00:44:50.100
came along for the ride through
this whole process of star

00:44:50.100 --> 00:44:52.530
formation, of planet
formation and accretion

00:44:52.530 --> 00:44:54.930
in our protoplanetary disks.

00:44:54.930 --> 00:44:59.130
And that the basic
building blocks of life,

00:44:59.130 --> 00:45:00.390
they seem to be pretty common.

00:45:00.390 --> 00:45:02.850
We see them in star forming
regions in abundance.

00:45:02.850 --> 00:45:05.070
And now we're finding
all these crazy planets

00:45:05.070 --> 00:45:08.169
around other stars-- we call
these the extra solar planets.

00:45:08.169 --> 00:45:09.960
And one of the other
lectures in our series

00:45:09.960 --> 00:45:11.940
is going to talk
to you about these.

00:45:11.940 --> 00:45:15.570
My guess is, the basic
building blocks of life

00:45:15.570 --> 00:45:18.480
are widespread in
planetary systems.

00:45:18.480 --> 00:45:21.180
And that the chemistry
that has taken place here

00:45:21.180 --> 00:45:23.220
has probably played
out millions of times

00:45:23.220 --> 00:45:25.184
elsewhere in our galaxy.

00:45:25.184 --> 00:45:26.100
But we're going to go.

00:45:26.100 --> 00:45:28.410
We're going to keep
going on this adventure.

00:45:28.410 --> 00:45:31.580
We're going to keep pursuing
these scientific questions.

00:45:31.580 --> 00:45:33.379
We're going to do it
in a very big way.

00:45:33.379 --> 00:45:34.920
What you're hearing
tonight is really

00:45:34.920 --> 00:45:37.920
just the prelude to what's
going to be happening right here

00:45:37.920 --> 00:45:40.710
in Tucson starting next year.

00:45:40.710 --> 00:45:43.680
I want you guys to come
with me on this ride.

00:45:43.680 --> 00:45:47.010
I'm leading a program called
the osiris-rex asteroid sample

00:45:47.010 --> 00:45:48.090
return mission.

00:45:48.090 --> 00:45:51.450
We are very busy at work
building a robot that we

00:45:51.450 --> 00:45:55.050
are going to put on top of a
giant column of explosives,

00:45:55.050 --> 00:45:57.540
and on September
3rd, 2016, we're

00:45:57.540 --> 00:45:59.370
going to light that
candle up, and we're

00:45:59.370 --> 00:46:02.324
going to throw this
robot into outer space.

00:46:02.324 --> 00:46:03.990
He's going to cruise
through outer space

00:46:03.990 --> 00:46:07.920
for two years to rendezvous
with a giant mountain

00:46:07.920 --> 00:46:10.440
of carbonaceous
chondrite material.

00:46:10.440 --> 00:46:12.750
And we're going to spend
about a year surveying it

00:46:12.750 --> 00:46:13.844
in great detail.

00:46:13.844 --> 00:46:15.510
We're going to do
things that have never

00:46:15.510 --> 00:46:18.120
been done before, we're
going to map it's chemistry

00:46:18.120 --> 00:46:21.510
and mineralogy across the
entire surface of the asteroid.

00:46:21.510 --> 00:46:24.270
It's about 500 meters
or 1,800 feet tall,

00:46:24.270 --> 00:46:25.704
about the size of Push Ridge.

00:46:25.704 --> 00:46:27.120
We're going to
start to get really

00:46:27.120 --> 00:46:30.300
interested on certain
spots on the surface, where

00:46:30.300 --> 00:46:35.490
we're ultimately going to do
some low altitude flyovers.

00:46:35.490 --> 00:46:38.400
We're going to investigate
these areas in great detail.

00:46:38.400 --> 00:46:41.580
And then I'm going to make
the call, "go", "no goo".

00:46:41.580 --> 00:46:43.620
And when it's "go",
we're going to deploy

00:46:43.620 --> 00:46:47.030
a robotic arm that's about three
meters long, nine feet long.

00:46:49.570 --> 00:46:51.250
This will be 2019.

00:46:51.250 --> 00:46:55.000
It'll be 15 years after I
started on this project.

00:46:55.000 --> 00:46:59.740
It'll be after we've spent about
a billion of US taxpayer money.

00:46:59.740 --> 00:47:02.830
We're going to take this
perfectly good satellite,

00:47:02.830 --> 00:47:06.409
and we're going to fly it into
the surface of an asteroid.

00:47:06.409 --> 00:47:08.700
We're going to do what we
call a touch and go maneuver.

00:47:08.700 --> 00:47:11.850
We're going to make contact with
that asteroid surface for five

00:47:11.850 --> 00:47:13.260
seconds.

00:47:13.260 --> 00:47:16.560
We will have spent 15
years planning and building

00:47:16.560 --> 00:47:17.730
this system.

00:47:17.730 --> 00:47:19.924
We're going to set a
giant air filter down

00:47:19.924 --> 00:47:21.840
on the surface, which
would be perfectly happy

00:47:21.840 --> 00:47:25.340
on the carburetor of 56 Chevy.

00:47:25.340 --> 00:47:28.980
We're going to open up a bottle
of gas, nitrogen in this case,

00:47:28.980 --> 00:47:30.980
and we're going to blow
it down into the surface

00:47:30.980 --> 00:47:32.300
of that asteroid.

00:47:32.300 --> 00:47:34.880
And that's going to agitate
the gravel and the dust

00:47:34.880 --> 00:47:37.070
that makes up the
surface of this object,

00:47:37.070 --> 00:47:38.886
and that filter is
going to catch it.

00:47:38.886 --> 00:47:40.760
And then we're going to
get out of the Dodge,

00:47:40.760 --> 00:47:42.343
because the asteroid
is probably going

00:47:42.343 --> 00:47:44.630
to throw a bunch of that
stuff back up towards it.

00:47:44.630 --> 00:47:45.980
We're going to check it out.

00:47:45.980 --> 00:47:48.080
When we think we've got
sample in that filter,

00:47:48.080 --> 00:47:50.410
we're going to open
up a return capsule,

00:47:50.410 --> 00:47:52.160
and we're going to
place it in the center.

00:47:52.160 --> 00:47:54.170
We're going to take
some pictures to make

00:47:54.170 --> 00:47:56.640
sure everything looks good.

00:47:56.640 --> 00:48:00.602
And then we're going to remove
the arm, leave the head behind.

00:48:00.602 --> 00:48:02.060
We're going to
button up, and we're

00:48:02.060 --> 00:48:04.820
going to spend 2.5
years coming back home.

00:48:07.430 --> 00:48:19.365
2.5 years later, we're going
to spin that capsule up,

00:48:19.365 --> 00:48:21.740
and we're going to drop it
into the top of the atmosphere

00:48:21.740 --> 00:48:24.734
at 28,000 per hour.

00:48:24.734 --> 00:48:27.150
Most of that energy will be
dissipated by the heat shield.

00:48:27.150 --> 00:48:28.470
We're using a proven design.

00:48:28.470 --> 00:48:31.170
Here's actually the Stardust
sample return capsule

00:48:31.170 --> 00:48:32.490
coming in.

00:48:32.490 --> 00:48:34.590
It's targeting the
Utah Test and Training

00:48:34.590 --> 00:48:36.920
Range to the southwest
of Salt Lake City.

00:48:36.920 --> 00:48:40.400
We'll open up a
couple of parachutes.

00:48:40.400 --> 00:48:46.520
In 2023, on September
24th, that capsule

00:48:46.520 --> 00:48:49.100
will be opened at the
NASA Johnson Space Center

00:48:49.100 --> 00:48:52.670
in Houston, Texas, and
20 years of my career

00:48:52.670 --> 00:48:56.630
will end with this
scientific treasure.

00:48:56.630 --> 00:48:58.175
No bacteria allowed.

00:49:05.384 --> 00:49:06.356
Thank you.

00:49:15.610 --> 00:49:17.530
So please, come with us.

00:49:17.530 --> 00:49:19.390
I really want Tucson
to celebrate this.

00:49:19.390 --> 00:49:22.030
It's all happening about
two miles up the road

00:49:22.030 --> 00:49:23.920
in the Michael J.
Drake building.

00:49:23.920 --> 00:49:26.014
And I want this
town-- I want it to be

00:49:26.014 --> 00:49:28.180
as excited as when the
Wildcats make the final four.

00:49:28.180 --> 00:49:28.971
This is a big deal.

00:49:41.060 --> 00:49:42.650
I want to thank a
couple of people.

00:49:42.650 --> 00:49:45.800
We've had a great team working
on this Life in the Universe

00:49:45.800 --> 00:49:46.520
series.

00:49:46.520 --> 00:49:48.410
Next week, you've got
a great talk coming up,

00:49:48.410 --> 00:49:51.050
I hope you're all here to see
Brian Enquist talk about Life

00:49:51.050 --> 00:49:53.600
on Earth, By Chance or By Law.

00:49:53.600 --> 00:49:56.300
I want to thank Ken [? Godat ?]
and Carl [? Philbond ?]

00:49:56.300 --> 00:49:59.660
for helping me prepare the
presentation for you tonight.

00:49:59.660 --> 00:50:03.350
And I want to thank Joaquin Ruiz
for getting us all together.

00:50:03.350 --> 00:50:05.540
Great things happen when
you put people in a room

00:50:05.540 --> 00:50:07.940
together to focus
on a common idea.

00:50:07.940 --> 00:50:09.470
