talked about how the early layers of the

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:21.539
talked about how the early layers of the
 

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:23.480
talked about how the early layers of the
neural network might detect edges and

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:23.490
neural network might detect edges and
 

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:25.340
neural network might detect edges and
then the summer later layers might

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:25.350
then the summer later layers might
 

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:27.859
then the summer later layers might
detect positive objects and then even

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:27.869
detect positive objects and then even
 

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:30.050
detect positive objects and then even
later layers may be to take parts of

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:30.060
later layers may be to take parts of
 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:32.659

can detect edges in an image let's take

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:41.100
can detect edges in an image let's take
 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:43.880
can detect edges in an image let's take
an example given a picture like that for

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:43.890
an example given a picture like that for
 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:45.889
an example given a picture like that for
a computer to figure out what are the

00:00:45.889 --> 00:00:45.899
a computer to figure out what are the
 

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:48.619
a computer to figure out what are the
objects in this picture the first thing

00:00:48.619 --> 00:00:48.629
objects in this picture the first thing
 

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:51.889
objects in this picture the first thing
you might do is maybe detect vertical

00:00:51.889 --> 00:00:51.899
you might do is maybe detect vertical
 

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:55.760
you might do is maybe detect vertical
edges in this image so for example this

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:55.770
edges in this image so for example this
 

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:58.250
edges in this image so for example this
image has all those vertical lines where

00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:58.260
image has all those vertical lines where
 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:00.529
image has all those vertical lines where
the railings are as was you know kind of

00:01:00.529 --> 00:01:00.539
the railings are as was you know kind of
 

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:02.750
the railings are as was you know kind of
vertical lines idea online movies

pedestrians and so those get detected in

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:05.580
pedestrians and so those get detected in
 

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:09.679
pedestrians and so those get detected in
this vertical edge detector output and

00:01:09.679 --> 00:01:09.689
this vertical edge detector output and
 

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:11.840
this vertical edge detector output and
you might also want to detect horizontal

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:11.850
you might also want to detect horizontal
 

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:14.330
you might also want to detect horizontal
edges so for example there's a very

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:14.340
edges so for example there's a very
 

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:15.980
edges so for example there's a very
strong horizontal line where this

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:15.990
strong horizontal line where this
 

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:18.620
strong horizontal line where this
railing is and that also gets detected

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:18.630
railing is and that also gets detected
 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:22.460
railing is and that also gets detected
sort of roughly here so how do you

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:22.470
sort of roughly here so how do you
 

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:25.160
sort of roughly here so how do you
detect edges in an image like this let's

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:25.170
detect edges in an image like this let's
 

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:29.200

look at an example here is a six by six

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:29.210
look at an example here is a six by six
 

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:31.850
look at an example here is a six by six
grayscale image and because this is a

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:31.860
grayscale image and because this is a
 

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:34.280
grayscale image and because this is a
grayscale image this is just a six by

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:34.290
grayscale image this is just a six by
 

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:37.520
grayscale image this is just a six by
six by one matrix rather than six by six

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:37.530
six by one matrix rather than six by six
 

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:40.069
six by one matrix rather than six by six
by three because they're on separate RGB

00:01:40.069 --> 00:01:40.079
by three because they're on separate RGB
 

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:43.340
by three because they're on separate RGB
channels in order to detect edges or

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:43.350
channels in order to detect edges or
 

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:45.020
channels in order to detect edges or
let's say vertical edges in this image

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:45.030
let's say vertical edges in this image
 

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:47.510
let's say vertical edges in this image

in these videos and what you're going to

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:18.480
in these videos and what you're going to
 

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:21.950
in these videos and what you're going to
do is take the 6x6 image and convolve it

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:21.960
do is take the 6x6 image and convolve it
 

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:25.490
do is take the 6x6 image and convolve it
and the convolution operation is denoted

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:25.500
and the convolution operation is denoted
 

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:30.380
and the convolution operation is denoted
by this asterisk in convolve it with the

thing about the notation is that in

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:35.940
thing about the notation is that in
 

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:39.380
thing about the notation is that in
mathematics the asterisk is the standard

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:39.390
mathematics the asterisk is the standard
 

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:42.110

this is also used to denote

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:44.100
this is also used to denote
 

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:46.460
this is also used to denote
multiplication or maybe element-wise

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:46.470
multiplication or maybe element-wise
 

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:49.760

but I'll try to be clear in these videos

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:55.020
but I'll try to be clear in these videos
 

00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:57.100
but I'll try to be clear in these videos
when this asterisks refers to

three region of your original input
 

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:31.240
three region of your original input
image so I've written here 1 1 1 0 0 0

00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:31.250
image so I've written here 1 1 1 0 0 0
 

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:35.479
image so I've written here 1 1 1 0 0 0
minus 1 minus 1 minus 1 and what you

00:03:35.479 --> 00:03:35.489
minus 1 minus 1 minus 1 and what you
 

00:03:35.489 --> 00:03:37.250
minus 1 minus 1 minus 1 and what you
should do is take the element wise

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:37.260
should do is take the element wise
 

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:39.620
should do is take the element wise
product so the first one would be 3

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:39.630
product so the first one would be 3
 

00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:42.530
product so the first one would be 3
times 1 and then the second one would be

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:42.540
times 1 and then the second one would be
 

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:45.920
times 1 and then the second one would be
1 times 1 I'm going down here 1 times 1

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:45.930
1 times 1 I'm going down here 1 times 1
 

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:50.449
1 times 1 I'm going down here 1 times 1
and then plus 2 times 1 this one and

00:03:50.449 --> 00:03:50.459
and then plus 2 times 1 this one and
 

00:03:50.459 --> 00:03:52.580
and then plus 2 times 1 this one and
then add up all of the resulting 9

00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:52.590
then add up all of the resulting 9
 

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:55.130
then add up all of the resulting 9
numbers so then the middle column gives

00:03:55.130 --> 00:03:55.140
numbers so then the middle column gives
 

00:03:55.140 --> 00:03:59.210
numbers so then the middle column gives
you 0 plus times 0 plus 5 times 0 4 7

00:03:59.210 --> 00:03:59.220
you 0 plus times 0 plus 5 times 0 4 7
 

00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:01.550
you 0 plus times 0 plus 5 times 0 4 7
times 0 and then the rightmost column

00:04:01.550 --> 00:04:01.560
times 0 and then the rightmost column
 

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:05.210
times 0 and then the rightmost column
gives 1 times minus 1 8 times minus 1

00:04:05.210 --> 00:04:05.220
gives 1 times minus 1 8 times minus 1
 

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:10.130
gives 1 times minus 1 8 times minus 1
plus 2 times minus 1 and adding up these

00:04:10.130 --> 00:04:10.140
plus 2 times minus 1 and adding up these
 

00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:15.190
plus 2 times minus 1 and adding up these
9 numbers will give you negative 5 and

00:04:15.190 --> 00:04:15.200
9 numbers will give you negative 5 and
 

00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:18.050
9 numbers will give you negative 5 and
so I'm going to fill in negative 5 over

00:04:18.050 --> 00:04:18.060
so I'm going to fill in negative 5 over
 

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:20.280
so I'm going to fill in negative 5 over
here ok and you can add

00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:20.290
here ok and you can add
 

00:04:20.290 --> 00:04:21.990
here ok and you can add

the first column then the second column

00:04:28.170 --> 00:04:28.180
the first column then the second column
 

00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:30.840
the first column then the second column
then the third next to figure out what

00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:30.850
then the third next to figure out what
 

00:04:30.850 --> 00:04:33.330
then the third next to figure out what
is this second element you're gonna take

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:33.340
is this second element you're gonna take
 

00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:37.260
is this second element you're gonna take
the blue square and shift it one step to

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:37.270
the blue square and shift it one step to
 

00:04:37.270 --> 00:04:40.320
the blue square and shift it one step to
the right like so and let me get rid of

00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:40.330
the right like so and let me get rid of
 

00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:42.810
the right like so and let me get rid of
the green moths here and you're going to

00:04:42.810 --> 00:04:42.820
the green moths here and you're going to
 

00:04:42.820 --> 00:04:45.180
the green moths here and you're going to
do the same element wise product and

00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:45.190
do the same element wise product and
 

00:04:45.190 --> 00:04:49.770
do the same element wise product and
then addition so you have 0 times 1 plus

00:04:49.770 --> 00:04:49.780
then addition so you have 0 times 1 plus
 

00:04:49.780 --> 00:04:54.690
then addition so you have 0 times 1 plus
5 times 1 plus 7 times 1 plus 1 times 0

00:04:54.690 --> 00:04:54.700
5 times 1 plus 7 times 1 plus 1 times 0
 

00:04:54.700 --> 00:04:57.840
5 times 1 plus 7 times 1 plus 1 times 0
plus 8 times 0 plus 2 times 0 plus 2

00:04:57.840 --> 00:04:57.850
plus 8 times 0 plus 2 times 0 plus 2
 

00:04:57.850 --> 00:05:00.000
plus 8 times 0 plus 2 times 0 plus 2
times negative 1 plus 9 times negative 1

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:00.010
times negative 1 plus 9 times negative 1
 

00:05:00.010 --> 00:05:04.980
times negative 1 plus 9 times negative 1
plus 5 times negative 1 and if you add

00:05:04.980 --> 00:05:04.990
plus 5 times negative 1 and if you add
 

00:05:04.990 --> 00:05:07.740
plus 5 times negative 1 and if you add
up those 9 numbers you end up with

00:05:07.740 --> 00:05:07.750
up those 9 numbers you end up with
 

00:05:07.750 --> 00:05:11.490
up those 9 numbers you end up with
negative 4 and so on if you ship this to

00:05:11.490 --> 00:05:11.500
negative 4 and so on if you ship this to
 

00:05:11.500 --> 00:05:14.280
negative 4 and so on if you ship this to
the right do the 9 products and add them

00:05:14.280 --> 00:05:14.290
the right do the 9 products and add them
 

00:05:14.290 --> 00:05:18.150
the right do the 9 products and add them
up you get 0 and then over here you

00:05:18.150 --> 00:05:18.160
up you get 0 and then over here you
 

00:05:18.160 --> 00:05:20.100
up you get 0 and then over here you
should get faint right then just to

00:05:20.100 --> 00:05:20.110
should get faint right then just to
 

00:05:20.110 --> 00:05:24.780
should get faint right then just to
verify you have 2 plus 9 plus 5 that's

00:05:24.780 --> 00:05:24.790
verify you have 2 plus 9 plus 5 that's
 

00:05:24.790 --> 00:05:28.380
verify you have 2 plus 9 plus 5 that's
16 then the middle column gives you 0

00:05:28.380 --> 00:05:28.390
16 then the middle column gives you 0
 

00:05:28.390 --> 00:05:31.770
16 then the middle column gives you 0
and then the rightmost column 4 plus 1

00:05:31.770 --> 00:05:31.780
and then the rightmost column 4 plus 1
 

00:05:31.780 --> 00:05:35.010
and then the rightmost column 4 plus 1
plus 3 times negative 1 that's minus 8

00:05:35.010 --> 00:05:35.020
plus 3 times negative 1 that's minus 8
 

00:05:35.020 --> 00:05:38.670
plus 3 times negative 1 that's minus 8
so that's 16 on the left column minus 8

00:05:38.670 --> 00:05:38.680
so that's 16 on the left column minus 8
 

00:05:38.680 --> 00:05:41.790
so that's 16 on the left column minus 8
and that gives you ain't right like we

00:05:41.790 --> 00:05:41.800
and that gives you ain't right like we
 

00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:45.270
and that gives you ain't right like we
have over here next in order to get you

00:05:45.270 --> 00:05:45.280

this element in the next row what you do

00:05:48.960 --> 00:05:48.970
this element in the next row what you do
 

00:05:48.970 --> 00:05:51.210
this element in the next row what you do
is take the blue square and now shift it

00:05:51.210 --> 00:05:51.220
is take the blue square and now shift it
 

00:05:51.220 --> 00:05:53.280
is take the blue square and now shift it
one down so you now have it in that

00:05:53.280 --> 00:05:53.290
one down so you now have it in that
 

00:05:53.290 --> 00:05:56.010
one down so you now have it in that
position and again repeat the

00:05:56.010 --> 00:05:56.020
position and again repeat the
 

00:05:56.020 --> 00:05:58.470
position and again repeat the
element-wise product and then adding

00:05:58.470 --> 00:05:58.480
element-wise product and then adding
 

00:05:58.480 --> 00:06:01.200
element-wise product and then adding
exercise and if you do that you should

00:06:01.200 --> 00:06:01.210
exercise and if you do that you should
 

00:06:01.210 --> 00:06:05.310
exercise and if you do that you should
get negative 10 here and they'd be

00:06:05.310 --> 00:06:05.320
get negative 10 here and they'd be
 

00:06:05.320 --> 00:06:08.580
get negative 10 here and they'd be
shifted one to the right you should get

00:06:08.580 --> 00:06:08.590
shifted one to the right you should get
 

00:06:08.590 --> 00:06:15.360
shifted one to the right you should get
negative 2 and then 2 and then 3 and so

00:06:15.360 --> 00:06:15.370
negative 2 and then 2 and then 3 and so
 

00:06:15.370 --> 00:06:18.870
negative 2 and then 2 and then 3 and so
on um - then throw in all the rest of

00:06:18.870 --> 00:06:18.880
on um - then throw in all the rest of
 

00:06:18.880 --> 00:06:22.050
on um - then throw in all the rest of
the elements of the matrix and so to be

00:06:22.050 --> 00:06:22.060
the elements of the matrix and so to be
 

00:06:22.060 --> 00:06:25.350
the elements of the matrix and so to be
clear this minus 16 would be obtained by

00:06:25.350 --> 00:06:25.360

00:08:43.190 --> 00:08:43.200
white to darker color
 

00:08:43.200 --> 00:08:47.090
white to darker color
so when you convolve this with the 3x3

00:08:47.090 --> 00:08:47.100
so when you convolve this with the 3x3
 

00:08:47.100 --> 00:08:51.090
so when you convolve this with the 3x3
filter and so this 3x3 filter can be

00:08:51.090 --> 00:08:51.100
filter and so this 3x3 filter can be
 

00:08:51.100 --> 00:08:54.740
filter and so this 3x3 filter can be
visualized as follows where is lighter

00:08:54.740 --> 00:08:54.750
visualized as follows where is lighter
 

00:08:54.750 --> 00:08:57.930
visualized as follows where is lighter
brighter pixels on the left and then

00:08:57.930 --> 00:08:57.940
brighter pixels on the left and then
 

00:08:57.940 --> 00:09:00.120
brighter pixels on the left and then
this mid-tone zeroes in the middle and

00:09:00.120 --> 00:09:00.130
this mid-tone zeroes in the middle and
 

00:09:00.130 --> 00:09:02.930
this mid-tone zeroes in the middle and
in darker on the right what you get is

00:09:02.930 --> 00:09:02.940
in darker on the right what you get is
 

00:09:02.940 --> 00:09:07.380
in darker on the right what you get is
this matrix on the right so just to

00:09:07.380 --> 00:09:07.390
this matrix on the right so just to
 

00:09:07.390 --> 00:09:11.190
this matrix on the right so just to
verify this NAFA you want this is 0 for

00:09:11.190 --> 00:09:11.200
verify this NAFA you want this is 0 for
 

00:09:11.200 --> 00:09:14.550
verify this NAFA you want this is 0 for
example is obtained by taking the

00:09:14.550 --> 00:09:14.560
example is obtained by taking the
 

00:09:14.560 --> 00:09:16.200
example is obtained by taking the
element wise products and then

00:09:16.200 --> 00:09:16.210
element wise products and then
 

00:09:16.210 --> 00:09:19.170
element wise products and then
multiplying with this 3x3 block and so

00:09:19.170 --> 00:09:19.180
multiplying with this 3x3 block and so
 

00:09:19.180 --> 00:09:22.920
multiplying with this 3x3 block and so
you get from the left column 10 plus 10

00:09:22.920 --> 00:09:22.930
you get from the left column 10 plus 10
 

00:09:22.930 --> 00:09:25.200
you get from the left column 10 plus 10
plus 10 and then zeros in the middle and

00:09:25.200 --> 00:09:25.210
plus 10 and then zeros in the middle and
 

00:09:25.210 --> 00:09:27.030
plus 10 and then zeros in the middle and
then minus 10 minus 10 minus 10 which

00:09:27.030 --> 00:09:27.040
then minus 10 minus 10 minus 10 which
 

00:09:27.040 --> 00:09:30.900
then minus 10 minus 10 minus 10 which
why you end up with 0 over here whereas

00:09:30.900 --> 00:09:30.910
why you end up with 0 over here whereas
 

00:09:30.910 --> 00:09:34.230
why you end up with 0 over here whereas
in contrast if that 30 will be obtained

00:09:34.230 --> 00:09:34.240
in contrast if that 30 will be obtained
 

00:09:34.240 --> 00:09:38.490
in contrast if that 30 will be obtained
from this which you get from having you

00:09:38.490 --> 00:09:38.500
from this which you get from having you
 

00:09:38.500 --> 00:09:42.330
from this which you get from having you
know 10 plus 10 plus 10 and then minus 0

00:09:42.330 --> 00:09:42.340
know 10 plus 10 plus 10 and then minus 0
 

00:09:42.340 --> 00:09:45.000
know 10 plus 10 plus 10 and then minus 0
minus 0 which is why you end up with a

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:45.010
minus 0 which is why you end up with a
 

00:09:45.010 --> 00:09:48.060
minus 0 which is why you end up with a
30 over there now if you plot this

00:09:48.060 --> 00:09:48.070
30 over there now if you plot this
 

00:09:48.070 --> 00:09:50.580
30 over there now if you plot this
rightmost matrix as an image it will

00:09:50.580 --> 00:09:50.590
rightmost matrix as an image it will
 

00:09:50.590 --> 00:09:52.050
rightmost matrix as an image it will
look like that where there's this

00:09:52.050 --> 00:09:52.060
look like that where there's this
 

00:09:52.060 --> 00:09:55.050
look like that where there's this
lighter region right in the middle and

00:09:55.050 --> 00:09:55.060
lighter region right in the middle and
 

00:09:55.060 --> 00:09:57.630
lighter region right in the middle and
that corresponds to is having detected

00:09:57.630 --> 00:09:57.640
that corresponds to is having detected
 

00:09:57.640 --> 00:10:00.750
that corresponds to is having detected
this vertical edge down the middle of

00:10:00.750 --> 00:10:00.760
this vertical edge down the middle of
 

00:10:00.760 --> 00:10:04.290
this vertical edge down the middle of
your 6x6 image and in case the

00:10:04.290 --> 00:10:04.300
your 6x6 image and in case the
 

00:10:04.300 --> 00:10:06.180
your 6x6 image and in case the
dimensions here seem a little bit wrong

00:10:06.180 --> 00:10:06.190
dimensions here seem a little bit wrong
 

00:10:06.190 --> 00:10:08.160
dimensions here seem a little bit wrong
you know that the detected age seems

00:10:08.160 --> 00:10:08.170
you know that the detected age seems
 

00:10:08.170 --> 00:10:10.380
you know that the detected age seems
really thick that's only because we're

00:10:10.380 --> 00:10:10.390
really thick that's only because we're
 

00:10:10.390 --> 00:10:12.750
really thick that's only because we're
working with very small images in this

00:10:12.750 --> 00:10:12.760
working with very small images in this
 

00:10:12.760 --> 00:10:15.020
working with very small images in this
example and if you're using say a

00:10:15.020 --> 00:10:15.030
example and if you're using say a
 

00:10:15.030 --> 00:10:17.400
example and if you're using say a
thousand by a thousand image rather than

00:10:17.400 --> 00:10:17.410
thousand by a thousand image rather than
 

00:10:17.410 --> 00:10:22.200
thousand by a thousand image rather than
6 by 6 image then you find that this you

00:10:22.200 --> 00:10:22.210
6 by 6 image then you find that this you
 

00:10:22.210 --> 00:10:23.730
6 by 6 image then you find that this you
know does a pretty good job where the

00:10:23.730 --> 00:10:23.740
know does a pretty good job where the
 

00:10:23.740 --> 00:10:25.920
know does a pretty good job where the
detecting the edges the vertical edges

00:10:25.920 --> 00:10:25.930
detecting the edges the vertical edges
 

00:10:25.930 --> 00:10:28.620
detecting the edges the vertical edges
in your image and in this example this

00:10:28.620 --> 00:10:28.630
in your image and in this example this
 

00:10:28.630 --> 00:10:31.770
in your image and in this example this
bright region in the middle is just the

00:10:31.770 --> 00:10:31.780
bright region in the middle is just the
 

00:10:31.780 --> 00:10:34.290
bright region in the middle is just the
output images way of saying that it

00:10:34.290 --> 00:10:34.300
output images way of saying that it
 

00:10:34.300 --> 00:10:36.390
output images way of saying that it
looks like there's a strong vertical

00:10:36.390 --> 00:10:36.400
looks like there's a strong vertical
 

00:10:36.400 --> 00:10:38.730
looks like there's a strong vertical
edge right down the middle of the image

00:10:38.730 --> 00:10:38.740
edge right down the middle of the image
 

00:10:38.740 --> 00:10:41.070
edge right down the middle of the image
and maybe one intuition to take away

00:10:41.070 --> 00:10:41.080
and maybe one intuition to take away
 

00:10:41.080 --> 00:10:43.140
and maybe one intuition to take away
from vertical edge detection is that a

00:10:43.140 --> 00:10:43.150
from vertical edge detection is that a
 

00:10:43.150 --> 00:10:47.400
from vertical edge detection is that a
vertical edge is a 3 by 3 region since

00:10:47.400 --> 00:10:47.410
vertical edge is a 3 by 3 region since
 

00:10:47.410 --> 00:10:49.710
vertical edge is a 3 by 3 region since
we're using a 3 by 3 filter where there

00:10:49.710 --> 00:10:49.720
we're using a 3 by 3 filter where there
 

00:10:49.720 --> 00:10:53.160
we're using a 3 by 3 filter where there
are bright pixels on the left and you

00:10:53.160 --> 00:10:53.170
are bright pixels on the left and you
 

00:10:53.170 --> 00:10:54.300
are bright pixels on the left and you
don't care that much what's in the

00:10:54.300 --> 00:10:54.310
don't care that much what's in the
 

00:10:54.310 --> 00:10:54.850
don't care that much what's in the
middle

00:10:54.850 --> 00:10:54.860
middle
 

00:10:54.860 --> 00:10:58.240
middle
and dark pixels on the right right and

00:10:58.240 --> 00:10:58.250
and dark pixels on the right right and
 

00:10:58.250 --> 00:11:00.580
and dark pixels on the right right and
the middle of the image is really in the

00:11:00.580 --> 00:11:00.590
the middle of the image is really in the
 

00:11:00.590 --> 00:11:02.920
the middle of the image is really in the
six by six image is really where you

00:11:02.920 --> 00:11:02.930
six by six image is really where you
 

00:11:02.930 --> 00:11:05.050
six by six image is really where you
know there could be bright pixels on the

00:11:05.050 --> 00:11:05.060
know there could be bright pixels on the
 

00:11:05.060 --> 00:11:07.870
know there could be bright pixels on the
left and darker pixels on the right and

00:11:07.870 --> 00:11:07.880
left and darker pixels on the right and
 

00:11:07.880 --> 00:11:10.350
left and darker pixels on the right and
that's why it thinks as a vertical edge

00:11:10.350 --> 00:11:10.360
that's why it thinks as a vertical edge
 

00:11:10.360 --> 00:11:13.270
that's why it thinks as a vertical edge
over there and the convolution operation

00:11:13.270 --> 00:11:13.280
over there and the convolution operation
 

00:11:13.280 --> 00:11:15.670
over there and the convolution operation
gives you a convenient way to specify

00:11:15.670 --> 00:11:15.680
gives you a convenient way to specify
 

00:11:15.680 --> 00:11:19.000
gives you a convenient way to specify
how to find these vertical edges in an

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:19.010
how to find these vertical edges in an
 

00:11:19.010 --> 00:11:21.430
how to find these vertical edges in an
image so you've now seen how the

00:11:21.430 --> 00:11:21.440
image so you've now seen how the
 

00:11:21.440 --> 00:11:24.250
