00:00:07.379 --> 00:00:08.700
What's up cinema fans?

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:11.849
Do you think you know everything there is
to know about the weird and wonderful world

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:12.849
of movies?

00:00:12.849 --> 00:00:17.430
Do you like testing that knowledge and bragging
to your friends about it?

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:19.100
Well then, you're going to love this video!

00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:21.890
Welcome to the latest edition of Screen Rant's
Ultimate Movie Quiz.

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:26.150
If you can get all 10 of these questions right,
then you can consider yourself a serious movie

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:27.150
buff!

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:29.859
Keep your score as you go and then leave it
in the comment section below!

00:00:29.859 --> 00:00:31.159
Make sure you tell the truth though!

00:00:31.159 --> 00:00:32.180
Let’s get started!

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:41.680
Spectre
In the 2015 James Bond movie Spectre, Christoph

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:46.370
Waltz played the villain Franz Oberhauser
- also known as Ernst Stavro Blofeld - but

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:48.850
which actor was originally approached for
the role?

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:59.810
A - William FichtnerB - Gary OldmanC - Mark
Strong

00:00:59.810 --> 00:01:03.760
Versatile English actor Gary Oldman was approached
first for the role of Oberhauser in Spectre,

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:07.720
but he wasn't willing to commit to six months
of worldwide production, so the role ultimately

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:09.870
went to the more than capable Christoph Waltz.

00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:12.840
Suicide Squad
Jared Leto put everything into his role as

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:17.130
The Joker for Suicide Squad, even though he
didn't end up getting much screen time.

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:21.950
But how did he go about perfecting the character's
laugh?A - He tried different laughs in public

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:26.509
to see which one made people more uncomfortableB
- He subjected himself to tickling in order

00:01:26.509 --> 00:01:31.600
to laugh in a completely uninhibited wayC
- He listened to the laughs of every single

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:37.959
previous version of the villain for hours
on end(Screen lights up A)That's right, to

00:01:37.959 --> 00:01:42.191
try and find the perfect laugh for his version
of the Clown Prince of Gotham City, Jared

00:01:42.191 --> 00:01:43.369
Leto publicly experimented with different
laughs in New York City and Toronto to see

00:01:43.369 --> 00:01:48.429
which ones made the people around him look
and feel the most uncomfortable.

00:01:48.429 --> 00:01:57.119
Jurassic World
Every high-profile Hollywood movie is given

00:01:57.119 --> 00:02:00.540
a secret identity during the early stages
of filming, in order to keep it a secret for

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:04.420
as long as possible, but what was the working
title of Jurassic World?

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:09.850
A - Tropical CycloneB - Debris FlowC - Ebb
Tide

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:13.660
Jurassic World actually shot under the secret
working production title Ebb Tide.

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:20.310
It was chosen by Steven Spielberg long before
director Colin Trevorrow was involved.

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:23.460
No one on set had a clue why Spielberg chose
this name.

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:29.430
Jason Bourne
2016 saw the return to the big screen of Matt

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:34.290
Damon's Jason Bourne - and the movie included
a memorable car chase in Las Vegas, Nevada.

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:44.470
But how many cars were destroyed when filming
the scene in question?

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:48.110
A - 17B - 117C - 170
The Las Vegas car chase sequence - which took

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:52.780
five weeks to shoot - ended up with no less
than 170 cars being wrecked.

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:56.090
This figure is according to producer Frank
Marshall, who knew the number immediately

00:02:56.090 --> 00:02:58.450
when questioned, as he had to pay the bills
for them all.

00:02:58.450 --> 00:03:02.680
He went onto say that all 170 cars are now
"in a trash heap somewhere".

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:09.620
Sausage Party
At a glance, Sausage Party might look like

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:13.780
a kid-friendly animated feature, but it's
far from being suitable for youngsters.

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:17.920
However, the trailer for Seth Rogen's adult
flick was accidentally played at a showing

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:19.690
of which of the following movies?

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:24.390
A - Kung Fu Panda 3B - The Jungle BookC - Finding
Dory

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:29.350
Yeah, erm...

00:03:29.350 --> 00:03:33.370
The red band trailer for Sausage Party was
shown by mistake in a screening of Finding

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:36.730
Dory at Brenden Concord theatre in Concord,
California.

00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:39.900
While some youngsters will undoubtedly have
found the whole thing very amusing, others

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:42.950
were left in shock, and their parents were
obviously horrified.

00:03:42.950 --> 00:03:45.430
The Martian
In Ridley Scott's The Martian, there are scenes

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:48.430
set in both NASA's HQ and the Chinese space
centre.

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:52.350
However, the buildings that represented those
two places in the movie were actually in the

00:03:52.350 --> 00:03:53.930
same city in reality.

00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:55.360
Which city was that?

00:03:55.360 --> 00:04:02.470
A - BudapestB - BucharestC - Brussels
The buildings that represented the NASA HQ

00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:06.290
and the Chinese space centre in The Martian
are actually in Budapest's two most famous

00:04:06.290 --> 00:04:10.400
cultural hubs and they're only 3 tram stops
from each other in real life.

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:19.880
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice marked

00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:23.850
the first occasion on which Ben Affleck would
portray the Dark Knight on the big screen.

00:04:23.850 --> 00:04:28.290
But what advice did the previous Batman, Christian
Bale, offer Affleck about playing the character?

00:04:28.290 --> 00:04:33.639
A - "Never break character on set"B - "Make
sure you can piss in that suit"C - "Do NOT

00:04:33.639 --> 00:04:40.370
watch the 1960's Batman TV show"
When the pair inadvertently met in a costume

00:04:40.370 --> 00:04:44.639
shop when they were each buying a Batman costume
for their kids, Ben Affleck asked Christian

00:04:44.639 --> 00:04:47.280
Bale for any advice he could give about playing
Batman.

00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:51.780
Bale quite candidly replied by telling Affleck
to "make sure you can piss in that suit" - which

00:04:51.780 --> 00:04:52.940
we're sure was very helpful.

00:04:52.940 --> 00:04:57.650
Captain America: Civil War
A number of drafts were written for Captain

00:04:57.650 --> 00:05:00.750
America: Civil War before the final script
was perfected.

00:05:00.750 --> 00:05:05.040
But which of these superhero characters wasn't
even originally written to appear in costume?

00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:12.150
A - Spider-ManB - Black PantherC - Hawkeye
It was Black Panther AKA T'Challa who had

00:05:12.150 --> 00:05:16.501
a much smaller role in the earlier drafts
and didn't even appear in costume, as the

00:05:16.501 --> 00:05:21.190
writers intended to focus on Spider-Man and
save Black Panther's origin for his own movie.

00:05:21.190 --> 00:05:25.350
However, when it looked like Marvel wouldn't
be allowed to use Spidey, T'Challa's role

00:05:25.350 --> 00:05:30.040
was beefed-up significantly and the studio
stuck with that plan.

00:05:30.040 --> 00:05:34.040
Zootopia
The brilliant animated feature Zootopia has

00:05:34.040 --> 00:05:38.660
been one of the most successful movies of
2016 so far, but which earlier Walt Disney

00:05:38.660 --> 00:05:43.300
Animation Studios movie hinted towards the
movie by showing a poster for it in the background?

00:05:43.300 --> 00:05:50.630
A - Wreck-It RalphB - Big Hero 6C - Frozen
Yup, there was indeed a poster for Zootopia

00:05:50.630 --> 00:05:55.930
in Walt Disney Animation Studios' 2014 superhero
offering Big Hero 6, and it could be seen

00:05:55.930 --> 00:05:59.700
in the scene when Baymax and Hiro fly under
the train tracks.

00:05:59.700 --> 00:06:04.710
X-Men: Apocalypse
X-Men: Apocalypse featured the younger generation

00:06:04.710 --> 00:06:09.330
of X-Men actors and, as such, Sir Patrick
Stewart's Professor Xavier did not appear.

00:06:09.330 --> 00:06:13.500
But which character did Stewart jokingly say
he'd be willing to play in an emergency?

00:06:13.500 --> 00:06:19.620
A - WolverineB - ApocalypseC - Mystique
(Screen lights up C)The wonderful Patrick

00:06:19.620 --> 00:06:23.260
Stewart jokingly informed director Bryan Singer
that he would be willing to play Mystique

00:06:23.260 --> 00:06:28.020
in X-Men: Apocalypse if Jennifer Lawrence
started "playing up", saying "I am so ready

00:06:28.020 --> 00:06:33.710
to be naked, painted blue, and the world is
ready for it too."

00:06:33.710 --> 00:06:38.340
