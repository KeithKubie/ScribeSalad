00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
Before we do more problems, let's do a quick lesson on inclined planes

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:09.000
because they're really a fascinating tool for making nature work for us.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:14.000
Now we already know that Galileo had a lot fun rolling balls down inclined planes.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:18.000
And if you remember the reason he did this was because it slowed down motion and allowed him

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.000
to make some measurements and observations that he couldn't have made with just objects in free fall.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:28.000
The question though is why did rolling balls down an inclined plane slowed down their motion.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
Sure it seems sort of obvious but let's analyze it.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:35.000
Instead of rolling balls, let's imagine sliding blocks because the physics of rolling

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.000
is slightly more complicated than I want to get into right now.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:41.000
We're zoomed in now, and here's our block and it has mass m.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:44.000
And we're going to let it slide down this inclined plane.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.000
For now, we're pretending this plane has no friction.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.000
Remember friction is the force associated with things rubbing.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.000
Well, let's do what we always do and draw a force diagram.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.000
As always, weight points straight downwards and then normal force

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:01.000
and remember normal means perpendicular, actually points from this direction

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.000
and that's because it has to be perpendicular.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:07.000
We're not allowing for any friction. Friction would point up or down the inclined plane.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.000
We're only allowing for this normal force.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.000
We'll up to now what we would have done was take this force

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.000
and break it into vertical and horizontal components.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:20.000
It turns out that's not the best way to solve this problem because we know from experience

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.000
that this block is going to slide down the ramp.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:26.000
It's not going to slide straight to the right or straight up or straight down.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:30.000
It's going to slide in this direction, so that's the direction we should care about.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.000
And how do we care about a direction?

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.000
Well, instead of breaking this force down, we break the weight down.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:41.000
We replace this downwards force with a force perpendicular to the surface,

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:45.000
which I've indicated with this little perpendicular symbol here and a force parallel,

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.000
which I've indicated with these two parallel lines.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:51.000
Now, the thing that's really cool is that if this plane was inclined at an angle α,

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:57.000
we can do some geometry to show that this angle here inside this triangle is also equal to α.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:02.000
And since this here is a right angle, we can do trigonometry.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:06.000
In fact, if we want to look at the sine of this angle for example,

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:11.000
well that's going to equal opposite over adjacent so F parallel over mg and when we solve that

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:14.000
we find that F parallel is just mg times the sine of this angle.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:19.000
I mean, just a similar thinking to show that F perpendicular is mg times the cosine of the angle.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.000
Now let's think about what's going on here.

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.000
Well I know that a block on a plane like this is going to slide this way.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:28.000
It won't jump off the plane, and it won't accelerate down into the plane. Okay.

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:32.000
So that means that in this direction the forces are all set. They're balanced.

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:37.000
Fn must equal F perpendicular. In fact, the only unbalanced force here is this parallel force.

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:43.000
And this parallel force since it's unbalanced is what's causing the acceleration.

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:49.000
It must be equal to ma. Well we can plug in what we know. F parallel is mg sin θ.

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:53.000
So this must be true and this tells me that the acceleration of an object

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:59.000
sliding down an inclined plane is equal to g times the sin of θ.

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:03.000
Now that's very amazing. This number sine of θ is always between 0 and 1.

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:05.000
It's always going to make g smaller.

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:10.000
So this is exactly why Galileo chose inclined planes, they slow down acceleration.

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:14.000
They make it smaller than g. Now, this was a lot of material.

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:17.000
If you have any questions, go to the forums and ask.

00:03:17.000 --> 99:59:59.000
Now we're going to move on to a couple more problems as I have promised.
