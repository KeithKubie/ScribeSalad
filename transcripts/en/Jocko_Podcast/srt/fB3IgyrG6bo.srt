[inaudible]

2
00:00:02,960 --> 00:00:04,550
if you want to win so bad,

3
00:00:06,180 --> 00:00:09,090
what I need to be worried
about is the team winning.

4
00:00:11,190 --> 00:00:14,340
Stop sitting around making
excuses and take action.

5
00:00:16,740 --> 00:00:17,160
[inaudible]

6
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:20,700
what's your team and you put your mission
above yourself and above your ego.

7
00:00:20,970 --> 00:00:24,960
You will win. Nothing's
going to get in my way.

8
00:00:26,670 --> 00:00:31,500
This isn't about data anymore. You're
moving into real life. If they get it,

9
00:00:31,501 --> 00:00:33,660
you've done it right. If they don't
get it, you haven't done it right.

10
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:38,430
The a situation, make a decision
and do something about it.

11
00:00:38,910 --> 00:00:40,980
You need to be at winter patches on.

12
00:00:42,870 --> 00:00:45,600
Don't always just think about
that immediate short term measure.

13
00:00:46,110 --> 00:00:49,200
Think about this strategic mission
as well. I know it sounds simple.

14
00:00:49,201 --> 00:00:53,370
It's not easy. Even though it's
hard work. We had fun. Why?

15
00:00:53,371 --> 00:00:55,980
Because it's fun to win. What
do you preach to other people,

16
00:00:55,981 --> 00:00:59,540
but actually hold the rate from
yourself. Who in here made it

17
00:00:59,610 --> 00:01:01,620
great decision when they were
emotional? Raise your hand.

18
00:01:02,470 --> 00:01:05,830
Yeah, that's right. And problems.

19
00:01:05,860 --> 00:01:07,570
They only get worse if
you don't address them.

20
00:01:08,650 --> 00:01:11,890
They're not responding the way they
should. It's not them. It's you.

21
00:01:12,820 --> 00:01:16,300
What do you call it? From the
sidelines in life? Absolutely nothing.

22
00:01:17,500 --> 00:01:19,450
No excuses, no feeling sorry for yourself.

23
00:01:19,750 --> 00:01:24,100
Just me checking your ego.
You can't self assess.

24
00:01:24,280 --> 00:01:29,200
You can't improve default aggressive.
We were unstoppable on the battlefield.

25
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,250
You gotta to truly believe
that it's possible to win.

26
00:01:33,370 --> 00:01:37,000
What leadership means to
me is winning at all costs.
