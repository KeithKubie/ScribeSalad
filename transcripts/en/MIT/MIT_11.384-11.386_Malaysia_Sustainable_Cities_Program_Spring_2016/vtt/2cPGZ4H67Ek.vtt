00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.500
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:46.200
HONG CHING GOH: What
is a mangrove forest?

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:48.390
Mangrove are the
only forests found

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:52.040
on the edge of the sea in
warm sub tropical and tropical

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:53.140
environments.

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:55.835
They can be easily recognized
by the dense tangle

00:01:55.835 --> 00:01:59.670
of [INAUDIBLE] roots that make
the trees appear to be standing

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:01.970
on stilts above the water.

00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:04.490
Mangrove are a
valuable resource.

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:08.139
They are estimated to
provide at least $1.6 billion

00:02:08.139 --> 00:02:11.420
annually in
[INAUDIBLE] services,

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:13.360
the multiple benefits
that humankind

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:15.550
enjoys from ecosystems.

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:20.350
This value is in the realm of
national GDP's such as that

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:22.400
of the Virgin Islands.

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:25.830
In recognition of the
significance of mangrove,

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:29.410
the Ramsar Convention for
conservation and sustainable

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:32.250
utilizations of mangrove
was signed on the

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:35.020
February 2nd, 1971.

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:39.790
February 2nd has been
declared World Wetlands Day.

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:43.460
A unique mix of marine
and [INAUDIBLE] species

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:48.800
live in mangrove ecosystems,
especially in Asian region.

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:52.600
The calm, sheltered waters
among the mangroves' roots

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:55.970
provide breeding, feeding,
and nursery grounds

00:02:55.970 --> 00:02:58.950
for fish and anthropoids.

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:03.180
Herons, spoonbills,
and even eagles

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:07.780
make their nests in the upper
branches of mangrove trees.

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:11.140
Reptiles are plenty.

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:15.080
Mangrove play a very important
role in soil formation

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:17.550
and shorelines protection.

00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:20.100
Their unique above
ground root structures

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:23.340
dampen watered currents.

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:25.860
They also reduce the
impact of strong winds

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:28.376
and tidal wave that
accompany tropical storms.

00:03:31.570 --> 00:03:34.030
Mangrove are among the
most carbon rich forests

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:39.450
in the Tropics, containing
an average 1023 mega grams

00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:42.540
carbon [INAUDIBLE],
at least three times

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:46.970
that of the upper
tropical forests.

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:49.430
Mangroves' wood is
most commonly used

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:52.690
as a source of fuel
for local communities,

00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:56.737
and as the primary construction
material for boats, houses,

00:03:56.737 --> 00:03:57.320
and furniture.

00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:03.640
In addition,
mangrove [INAUDIBLE]

00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:06.350
fisheries, the main
source of livelihood

00:04:06.350 --> 00:04:08.780
for many local communities.

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:11.160
Mangrove also contain
great medicine

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:14.170
of value including [INAUDIBLE],
bleeding and malaria,

00:04:14.170 --> 00:04:15.380
to name a few.

00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:17.779
Cannonball mangrove
fruit, for instance,

00:04:17.779 --> 00:04:19.880
is used to treat diarrhea.

00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:22.370
In many parts of the
world, mangrove also

00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:26.042
bear great cultural significance
for local communities,

00:04:26.042 --> 00:04:28.830
such as the indigenous
peoples of the Torres Strait

00:04:28.830 --> 00:04:32.250
Islands, who have used
Australia's mangrove for more

00:04:32.250 --> 00:04:34.800
than 40,000 years.

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:37.925
Despite its importance, the
rate of mangrove deforestation

00:04:37.925 --> 00:04:41.420
is among the highest
of any forest type.

00:04:41.420 --> 00:04:44.400
And urbanization
has been identified

00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:47.000
as a significant
threat to the survival

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:50.970
of these coastal flagship
natural resources.

00:04:50.970 --> 00:04:53.640
Urbanization refer
to the concentrations

00:04:53.640 --> 00:04:56.680
of human population
into discrete areas.

00:04:56.680 --> 00:05:00.145
Cities, leading to the
transformations of land.

00:05:00.145 --> 00:05:04.580
It is a global phenomenon that
is intensifying especially

00:05:04.580 --> 00:05:07.340
in low and median
income countries.

00:05:07.340 --> 00:05:10.070
Today, half of the
world's populations

00:05:10.070 --> 00:05:12.850
live within 60
kilometers of the sea,

00:05:12.850 --> 00:05:15.140
and three quarters of
all the largest cities

00:05:15.140 --> 00:05:16.880
are located on the coast.

00:05:16.880 --> 00:05:19.010
While cities foster
economic, growth,

00:05:19.010 --> 00:05:23.030
and offer the vast majority
of employment opportunities,

00:05:23.030 --> 00:05:27.030
urbanization also brings
congestion and pollution.

00:05:27.030 --> 00:05:30.330
It also escalates [INAUDIBLE]
such as displacements

00:05:30.330 --> 00:05:33.220
of native peoples
and urban poverty.

00:05:33.220 --> 00:05:35.060
The fundamental
change it causes,

00:05:35.060 --> 00:05:39.030
however, is the
transformation of nature.

00:05:39.030 --> 00:05:41.830
Globally, urban development
is the major driver

00:05:41.830 --> 00:05:46.150
of climate change, producing
half of all greenhouse gas

00:05:46.150 --> 00:05:47.040
emissions.

00:05:47.040 --> 00:05:50.020
Luckily, land in coastal
area is reclaimed

00:05:50.020 --> 00:05:52.990
for property development,
and mangrove forests

00:05:52.990 --> 00:05:55.810
are transformed into
open water fronts.

00:05:55.810 --> 00:05:57.870
Malaysia is a median
income country

00:05:57.870 --> 00:05:59.860
located in Southeast Asia.

00:05:59.860 --> 00:06:05.370
We have a total coastline
of 4,675 kilometers.

00:06:05.370 --> 00:06:07.880
In these coastal
areas, mangrove forests

00:06:07.880 --> 00:06:10.970
are found, which,
at the end of 2006,

00:06:10.970 --> 00:06:16.470
were estimated at 107,802
hectares in Peninsula Malaysia

00:06:16.470 --> 00:06:17.940
alone.

00:06:17.940 --> 00:06:21.150
Today, very few mangrove remain.

00:06:21.150 --> 00:06:26.710
Over 18% of the mangrove were
lost between 1975 and 2005,

00:06:26.710 --> 00:06:31.480
primarily due to conversions
of land for agriculture, shrimp

00:06:31.480 --> 00:06:33.800
ponds, or open development.

00:06:33.800 --> 00:06:36.760
Johor, Malaysia's
southernmost state,

00:06:36.760 --> 00:06:39.570
is home to more than a
quarter of the total remaining

00:06:39.570 --> 00:06:42.760
mangrove in Peninsula Malaysia.

00:06:42.760 --> 00:06:46.220
Is also home to
[INAUDIBLE] areas

00:06:46.220 --> 00:06:50.870
of international importance
for conserving biodiversity.

00:06:50.870 --> 00:06:53.250
All three of these
[INAUDIBLE] are located

00:06:53.250 --> 00:06:54.615
within Iskandar Malaysia.

00:06:57.440 --> 00:07:00.550
Established in 2006,
Iskandar Malaysia

00:07:00.550 --> 00:07:03.380
is a national special,
economic region,

00:07:03.380 --> 00:07:06.860
located in southern Johor,
just across the straits

00:07:06.860 --> 00:07:09.150
from Singapore.

00:07:09.150 --> 00:07:14.240
It is modeled the Pearl River
delta economic zone of China,

00:07:14.240 --> 00:07:16.910
with the purpose to
capitalize on its existing

00:07:16.910 --> 00:07:20.070
synergies with Singapore.

00:07:20.070 --> 00:07:21.990
The region has a
land size that is

00:07:21.990 --> 00:07:26.310
three times that of Singapore,
and is administrated

00:07:26.310 --> 00:07:29.370
by the Iskandar Regional
Deferment Authority,

00:07:29.370 --> 00:07:31.780
or [INAUDIBLE].

00:07:31.780 --> 00:07:34.230
The indigenous group
around [INAUDIBLE]

00:07:34.230 --> 00:07:36.850
once practicing a
nomadic lifestyle,

00:07:36.850 --> 00:07:40.090
have settled down along the
southern coast of Johor.

00:07:40.090 --> 00:07:43.882
They live in coastal
areas and river estuaries,

00:07:43.882 --> 00:07:46.440
and like many
other local people,

00:07:46.440 --> 00:07:49.570
are dependent on mangrove
for their livelihood.

00:07:49.570 --> 00:07:54.170
Today, mangrove conservation
in Johor is becoming critical.

00:07:54.170 --> 00:07:56.230
With fast phase
urbanization taking

00:07:56.230 --> 00:08:00.530
place in Iskandar Malaysia,
local and indigenous groups

00:08:00.530 --> 00:08:02.830
dependent on mangrove
face the truth

00:08:02.830 --> 00:08:05.890
of losing their homes
and source of livelihood.

00:08:08.960 --> 00:08:12.260
Iskandar Malaysia aims to
be a strong and sustainable

00:08:12.260 --> 00:08:15.300
metropolis of
international standing.

00:08:15.300 --> 00:08:19.300
To support this vision, three
mangrove management strategies

00:08:19.300 --> 00:08:21.510
can, and should be pursued.

00:08:21.510 --> 00:08:23.170
Strategy one.

00:08:23.170 --> 00:08:27.020
Ecotourism as a mangrove
environmental service.

00:08:27.020 --> 00:08:30.090
An ecotourism project
in Iskandar Malaysia

00:08:30.090 --> 00:08:32.740
has been launched in 2013.

00:08:32.740 --> 00:08:36.718
However, it was limited to a
single village Kompang Sona

00:08:36.718 --> 00:08:39.679
Melayu, at the Melayu River.

00:08:39.679 --> 00:08:43.679
Meanwhile, a study on tourism
potential of the [INAUDIBLE]

00:08:43.679 --> 00:08:48.910
region was conducted in 2010,
but the actual implementation

00:08:48.910 --> 00:08:50.910
has not taken place.

00:08:50.910 --> 00:08:54.560
It is promising that tourism,
with education at its core,

00:08:54.560 --> 00:08:58.030
can be ecologically and
economically beneficial

00:08:58.030 --> 00:08:59.740
to local villages.

00:08:59.740 --> 00:09:02.670
However, this strategy
and its benefits

00:09:02.670 --> 00:09:05.240
must be shared by
more communities

00:09:05.240 --> 00:09:08.230
to include both the local
and indigenous people

00:09:08.230 --> 00:09:11.600
in the [INAUDIBLE] district,
along [INAUDIBLE] River,

00:09:11.600 --> 00:09:12.400
as well.

00:09:12.400 --> 00:09:16.660
In addition, capacity building
for tourism operations,

00:09:16.660 --> 00:09:19.700
and the linkage between
local businesses and tourism

00:09:19.700 --> 00:09:23.220
networks at the state
level must be established.

00:09:23.220 --> 00:09:26.580
For this, the Ministry
of Tourism and Culture

00:09:26.580 --> 00:09:30.890
must take the lead in working
with all relevant stakeholders.

00:09:30.890 --> 00:09:32.210
Strategy two.

00:09:32.210 --> 00:09:35.060
Technology for
mangrove monitoring.

00:09:35.060 --> 00:09:38.120
The applications of
GRS and remote sensing

00:09:38.120 --> 00:09:41.520
in mangrove management
must be incorporated

00:09:41.520 --> 00:09:43.290
in the existing
manual monitoring

00:09:43.290 --> 00:09:47.080
practices by the Johor
forestry department.

00:09:47.080 --> 00:09:50.930
These technologies are
powerful at systematically

00:09:50.930 --> 00:09:53.820
and periodically measuring
the effectiveness

00:09:53.820 --> 00:09:56.500
of ongoing management practices.

00:09:56.500 --> 00:10:00.280
Subsequently, this provides
a more defensible basis

00:10:00.280 --> 00:10:02.630
for management actions
towards conservation.

00:10:02.630 --> 00:10:07.770
SPEAKER: Remote sensing is
one of the latest technology,

00:10:07.770 --> 00:10:10.530
I wouldn't say latest
because it is there

00:10:10.530 --> 00:10:16.450
in the market since 1970s,
is the only practical way

00:10:16.450 --> 00:10:21.190
to get rapid information
about mangrove changes.

00:10:21.190 --> 00:10:22.580
HONG CHING GOH: Strategy three.

00:10:22.580 --> 00:10:25.350
Core management for
mangrove governance.

00:10:25.350 --> 00:10:28.400
The institutional structure
for managing natural resources

00:10:28.400 --> 00:10:31.680
in most developing countries,
including Malaysia,

00:10:31.680 --> 00:10:35.890
is based on a top down approach,
and is very much development

00:10:35.890 --> 00:10:37.700
driven.

00:10:37.700 --> 00:10:40.840
In light of sustainable
city's development objectives,

00:10:40.840 --> 00:10:43.630
and the current state
of mangrove destruction,

00:10:43.630 --> 00:10:47.200
combination among interdependent
governance structures

00:10:47.200 --> 00:10:50.610
is the core of effective
mangrove management.

00:10:50.610 --> 00:10:53.180
As land is prescribed
as state matter

00:10:53.180 --> 00:10:56.380
under the federal
constitution, the agencies

00:10:56.380 --> 00:10:59.960
dealing with mangrove, such as
the Department of Environment,

00:10:59.960 --> 00:11:03.240
are merely technical advisers
reviewing land development

00:11:03.240 --> 00:11:04.390
proposals.

00:11:04.390 --> 00:11:06.900
They have little power
when it comes to land

00:11:06.900 --> 00:11:08.970
development decision making.

00:11:08.970 --> 00:11:13.810
It is recommended that these
agencies be given more power,

00:11:13.810 --> 00:11:17.540
and be directly involved in
the decision making process.

00:11:17.540 --> 00:11:21.260
Moreover, [INAUDIBLE] impact
assessment requirement

00:11:21.260 --> 00:11:24.060
must be strictly enforced.

00:11:24.060 --> 00:11:28.460
At the local level, the Iskandar
regional development authority

00:11:28.460 --> 00:11:31.900
has initiated efforts to
include local communities

00:11:31.900 --> 00:11:34.760
in mangrove
conservation projects.

00:11:34.760 --> 00:11:37.070
However, the scope
of participation

00:11:37.070 --> 00:11:39.340
is confined to
public [INAUDIBLE]

00:11:39.340 --> 00:11:40.830
and the capacity
building related

00:11:40.830 --> 00:11:42.821
to resource consumption.

00:11:42.821 --> 00:11:44.570
MADAM IVY WONG ABDULLAH:
Within IRDA we've

00:11:44.570 --> 00:11:48.230
got a social development
division that works closely

00:11:48.230 --> 00:11:51.240
with the communities to
ensure that whatever economic

00:11:51.240 --> 00:11:53.600
development that we
bring to the region,

00:11:53.600 --> 00:11:57.200
it needs to have the
inclusion of the people.

00:11:57.200 --> 00:12:03.210
For example, closely to mangrove
communities is the [INAUDIBLE]

00:12:03.210 --> 00:12:05.000
so we have been working
closely with them

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:09.930
for the last few years to build
the capacity of the community

00:12:09.930 --> 00:12:15.190
in arranging visits by tourists
to the surrounding mangroves.

00:12:15.190 --> 00:12:22.220
So boat visits to the mangrove
forest, and also to the kelong,

00:12:22.220 --> 00:12:27.530
where the community is rearing
mussels, green mussels,

00:12:27.530 --> 00:12:29.250
and also some fishes.

00:12:29.250 --> 00:12:30.900
So I think the sea
bass and all that.

00:12:30.900 --> 00:12:34.280
We're working with the
people because there's

00:12:34.280 --> 00:12:38.290
a platform that was created,
Friends of Iskandar Ramsar,

00:12:38.290 --> 00:12:42.640
to work with them in carrying
out educational research

00:12:42.640 --> 00:12:43.140
programs.

00:12:43.140 --> 00:12:44.515
HONG CHING GOH:
It is [INAUDIBLE]

00:12:44.515 --> 00:12:46.460
that the level of
participations amongst

00:12:46.460 --> 00:12:49.800
local and indigenous
communities be expanded,

00:12:49.800 --> 00:12:52.620
and that they are not only
given the rights to use

00:12:52.620 --> 00:12:56.310
mangrove resources as
granted by the authorities,

00:12:56.310 --> 00:12:59.680
but also the rights to
take part in managing

00:12:59.680 --> 00:13:03.220
those resources together
with government agencies.

00:13:03.220 --> 00:13:06.300
For that, core management
becomes a viable means

00:13:06.300 --> 00:13:08.550
to bring all
stakeholders together

00:13:08.550 --> 00:13:11.040
despite their
different interests.

00:13:11.040 --> 00:13:13.950
Here, finding the right
mix of stakeholders

00:13:13.950 --> 00:13:16.630
to govern the resources
becomes the key.

00:13:16.630 --> 00:13:19.105
The Senai Pulai Forest
Reserve, an area

00:13:19.105 --> 00:13:21.550
in urgent need for
protected area status,

00:13:21.550 --> 00:13:26.360
provides a example of the need
for a core management strategy.

00:13:26.360 --> 00:13:31.410
At present, harvesting this on
a 20 years rotation schedule,

00:13:31.410 --> 00:13:33.760
is the major economic
activities here.

00:13:33.760 --> 00:13:36.270
The mangrove management
plan is outlined

00:13:36.270 --> 00:13:38.580
in the overall forestry
management plan

00:13:38.580 --> 00:13:41.570
but this will expire in 2015.

00:13:41.570 --> 00:13:43.640
VINCENT K.K. CHOW:
If it is talking

00:13:43.640 --> 00:13:46.110
about the role of
the forestry, I

00:13:46.110 --> 00:13:48.830
think they're doing
a very good job.

00:13:48.830 --> 00:13:51.396
Although you see
mangrove being cut,

00:13:51.396 --> 00:13:55.290
but this is on rotation
basis, small areas where

00:13:55.290 --> 00:13:58.340
the concessionary will replant.

00:13:58.340 --> 00:14:02.390
So the only fear is the
original species maybe

00:14:02.390 --> 00:14:04.760
wiped out because they're
going to mono-cropping.

00:14:04.760 --> 00:14:06.700
HONG CHING GOH: Therefore,
the preparations

00:14:06.700 --> 00:14:09.870
of a comprehensive
management plan specifically

00:14:09.870 --> 00:14:12.280
for mangrove forest
is urgently needed

00:14:12.280 --> 00:14:14.320
to indicate the
permitted land uses,

00:14:14.320 --> 00:14:16.870
the carrying capacity
of those uses,

00:14:16.870 --> 00:14:19.450
and the stakeholders
that need to be involved

00:14:19.450 --> 00:14:21.370
in the management process.

00:14:21.370 --> 00:14:23.760
Apart from the tree
shortages just described,

00:14:23.760 --> 00:14:26.940
the potential for
moral considerations

00:14:26.940 --> 00:14:32.210
and religious values to play a
unifying and revitalizing role

00:14:32.210 --> 00:14:36.370
in mangrove conservation, and
nature conservation in general,

00:14:36.370 --> 00:14:39.470
must be further explored
in development planning

00:14:39.470 --> 00:14:41.500
and at the societal level.

00:14:41.500 --> 00:14:44.180
In fact, a holistic
approach to land

00:14:44.180 --> 00:14:48.970
use development planning, known
as the total planning doctrine,

00:14:48.970 --> 00:14:52.820
was introduced in the mid-1990s
by the federal government

00:14:52.820 --> 00:14:54.330
of Malaysia.

00:14:54.330 --> 00:14:57.650
It aims to integrate
physical and social planning

00:14:57.650 --> 00:15:00.040
with moral and spiritual values.

00:15:00.040 --> 00:15:03.480
However, little evidence
shows the implementations

00:15:03.480 --> 00:15:05.830
of the approach in reality.

00:15:05.830 --> 00:15:09.670
At the societal level, the
dominant religious customs

00:15:09.670 --> 00:15:13.020
have been still mainly confined
to discrete practices, rather

00:15:13.020 --> 00:15:16.120
than a way of life,
which has the potential

00:15:16.120 --> 00:15:19.670
to cultivate a direct
connection between humans

00:15:19.670 --> 00:15:21.290
and the environment.

00:15:21.290 --> 00:15:36.720
WAN MOHD YUSOF WAN
CHIK: [NON ENGLISH]

00:15:36.720 --> 00:15:38.530
HONG CHING GOH:
Urbanization is one

00:15:38.530 --> 00:15:40.930
of the most complex
and important

00:15:40.930 --> 00:15:45.360
social economic phenomena
of the 21st century.

00:15:45.360 --> 00:15:50.610
It is forceful, irreversible,
and constantly evolving.

00:15:50.610 --> 00:15:53.570
It also represents a major
change in the extraction

00:15:53.570 --> 00:15:56.090
and consumptions of
nature resources,

00:15:56.090 --> 00:16:00.570
and the way that society
interacts with nature.

00:16:00.570 --> 00:16:04.780
Yet, if we only see
cities as a problem,

00:16:04.780 --> 00:16:08.600
we fail to recognize how cities
offer improved quality of life,

00:16:08.600 --> 00:16:12.100
and serve us the
centers for culture.

00:16:12.100 --> 00:16:14.710
The strategies
recommended in this video

00:16:14.710 --> 00:16:17.840
for mangrove governance
in Iskandar Malaysia

00:16:17.840 --> 00:16:22.220
incorporates a wide range of
appreciations for mangrove.

00:16:22.220 --> 00:16:25.480
This [INAUDIBLE] the quest
for a meaningful practice

00:16:25.480 --> 00:16:28.830
of sustainable
urban development.

00:16:28.830 --> 00:16:31.430
At the regional level
the strong presence

00:16:31.430 --> 00:16:33.260
of mangrove and
indigenous people

00:16:33.260 --> 00:16:36.770
presents an opportunity
for Iskandar Malaysia

00:16:36.770 --> 00:16:40.880
to be a unique living model
of a developing countries that

00:16:40.880 --> 00:16:44.570
substantially improve the
metropolises by making

00:16:44.570 --> 00:16:48.550
the relationship between nature,
culture, and view environment

00:16:48.550 --> 00:16:52.080
a synergized and symbiotic one.

00:16:52.080 --> 00:16:55.060
At the national level,
mangrove conservation

00:16:55.060 --> 00:16:57.580
directly supports
Malaysians' efforts

00:16:57.580 --> 00:17:00.550
to reduce carbon emission in
light of the global climate

00:17:00.550 --> 00:17:02.140
change agenda.

00:17:02.140 --> 00:17:04.480
So are there
strategies likely to be

00:17:04.480 --> 00:17:08.050
useful for other cities facing
similar development driven

00:17:08.050 --> 00:17:09.950
challenges?

00:17:09.950 --> 00:17:11.640
Yes, they are.

00:17:11.640 --> 00:17:14.349
These studies is an
example of [INAUDIBLE]

00:17:14.349 --> 00:17:17.150
learning by sharing
lessons and ideas

00:17:17.150 --> 00:17:20.170
through digital communication.

00:17:20.170 --> 00:17:23.900
Similar to the case of Iskandar
Malaysia, many emerging

00:17:23.900 --> 00:17:27.710
cities in developing countries
are rich in natural resources

00:17:27.710 --> 00:17:31.370
and culture, and striving
for economic development

00:17:31.370 --> 00:17:35.500
has put tremendous pressure
on these precious assets.

00:17:35.500 --> 00:17:38.320
Meanwhile, transparency
has been a key concern

00:17:38.320 --> 00:17:39.790
in developing countries.

00:17:39.790 --> 00:17:43.720
Yet little evidence reveals
that transparency alone

00:17:43.720 --> 00:17:45.880
can make a significant
contribution

00:17:45.880 --> 00:17:47.940
towards sustainabilities' goals.

00:17:47.940 --> 00:17:50.580
Benefits sharing and
capacity building,

00:17:50.580 --> 00:17:53.250
as highlighted in the
mangrove management strategies

00:17:53.250 --> 00:17:56.090
in this video,
are believed to be

00:17:56.090 --> 00:17:58.530
the enabling factors
for transparency

00:17:58.530 --> 00:18:01.070
to achieve its effect.

00:18:01.070 --> 00:18:05.080
However, the prioritizations
of these strategies

00:18:05.080 --> 00:18:08.370
require careful considerations
of the past and present,

00:18:08.370 --> 00:18:11.510
political and social
cultural context of the city,

00:18:11.510 --> 00:18:14.090
as well as the state
and the ideologies

00:18:14.090 --> 00:18:16.905
behind the region's economic
development activity.

00:18:44.490 --> 00:18:44.990
Bye bye.

00:18:44.990 --> 00:18:48.340
