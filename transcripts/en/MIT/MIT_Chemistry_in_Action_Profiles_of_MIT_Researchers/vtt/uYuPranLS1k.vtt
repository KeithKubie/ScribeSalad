00:00:00.709 --> 00:00:02.875
PROFESSOR KATHARINA RIBBECK:
My group studies slime.

00:00:02.875 --> 00:00:04.575
[LAUGHTER]

00:00:04.575 --> 00:00:06.320
[DING]

00:00:06.320 --> 00:00:08.060
[DING]

00:00:08.060 --> 00:00:13.850
It is largely viewed as
some sort of waste product,

00:00:13.850 --> 00:00:15.455
similar to feces.

00:00:15.455 --> 00:00:19.520
And my mission is to, really,
correct this image, and show

00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:22.070
that it has really very,
very important functions

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:23.990
for biology.

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:25.790
We focus on mucus.

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:29.450
That is a very important
slime for our body.

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:31.690
Mucus is more commonly
known as snot.

00:00:31.690 --> 00:00:34.620
And it coats all wet
everything in our body--

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:37.830
eyes, nose, mouth,
lungs, digestive tract,

00:00:37.830 --> 00:00:39.050
and female genital track.

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:43.010
And it has very, very
important functions.

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:46.160
These are bacteria
swimming in slime.

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:49.460
Some of the mucus
can distinguish

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:51.350
between good and bad.

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:54.830
It allows many bacteria
to live in that.

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:57.410
That constitutes our microbiota.

00:00:57.410 --> 00:01:00.500
But then it rejects,
in most cases,

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:02.960
bacteria or viruses
that are potentially

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:04.220
harmful to the body.

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:08.180
We have mucus from women
who are in preterm labor,

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:11.030
and women that are
pregnant, at exactly

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:13.100
the same gestational stage.

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:16.410
GRACE YAO: So mayo
is similar to what

00:01:16.410 --> 00:01:18.690
mucus in a normal
pregnancy should look like.

00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:21.920
It's thick, opaque,
and it doesn't really

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:24.200
form any kind of filament.

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:26.227
It just breaks apart like this.

00:01:26.227 --> 00:01:28.310
PROFESSOR KATHARINA RIBBECK:
In preterm pregnancy,

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:33.020
we see that the mucus
may be altered in ways--

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:34.910
that it is more permeable.

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:36.320
[CRACK]

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:38.450
GRACE YAO: Egg white--

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:40.460
so it's more translucent.

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:45.895
And you can see that it
forms a kind of filament when

00:01:45.895 --> 00:01:47.874
I stretch my fingers apart.

00:01:47.874 --> 00:01:50.290
PROFESSOR KATHARINA RIBBECK:
It really resembles the mucus

00:01:50.290 --> 00:01:53.140
as it is during your
fertile phase-- that

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:56.080
is, the maximally
permeable phase, which

00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:58.690
is very bad news
because that means

00:01:58.690 --> 00:02:02.770
that, potentially, a lot of
pathogens can go through.

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:04.240
One of our goals
with the study is

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:11.230
to look for markers that
might predict, far in advance,

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:14.580
that a woman might be at
risk for preterm labor.

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:18.130
If you grow too fond
of your hypothesis,

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:20.050
and then you do that
one experiment--

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:23.020
which was supposed to be a
control and that proves you

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:24.000
wrong--

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.620
then, you can't fall apart.

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:29.740
It's very, very important
to always, always

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:31.450
be prepared that you're wrong.

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:34.645
Discovering mucus-- it's
a roller coaster, really.

00:02:34.645 --> 00:02:39.880
Every experiment almost tells
us something new and unexpected.
