[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:08.070
JOHN PETRENKO: Hey,
welcome to Google Chicago.

00:00:08.070 --> 00:00:11.290
Right now we have some
amazing people here with us.

00:00:11.290 --> 00:00:13.680
My name is John Petrenko,
I've been in specialty coffee

00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:16.650
for the last nine years or so.

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:19.920
And again, I'm a huge
fan of Intelligentsia,

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:22.600
and I'm totally affecting
some nervous energy here.

00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:23.564
But--

00:00:23.564 --> 00:00:24.330
[LAUGHTER]

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:26.430
I would like to introduce
our panel right now.

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:28.260
To my right, we have
James McLaughlin,

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:32.009
he's the CEO and president
of Intelligentsia Coffee.

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:35.040
Followed by Sam Sabori,
the national roasting

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:36.630
and quality control manager.

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:38.550
Then Michael Sheridan
is the director

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:41.100
of sourcing and shared
value at Intelligentsia

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:42.698
Coffee in Chicago.

00:00:42.698 --> 00:00:44.988
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:49.720
So thank you for coming
out to Google Chicago.

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:51.872
It's a pleasure to
have you guys here.

00:00:51.872 --> 00:00:53.830
We really want to get
into all these questions,

00:00:53.830 --> 00:00:58.480
and just really dive into what
makes Intelligentsia amazing,

00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:00.200
because it is super amazing.

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:03.466
I love it so much, I go
there as much as possible.

00:01:03.466 --> 00:01:04.840
I mean, we just
want to know what

00:01:04.840 --> 00:01:06.730
makes Intelligentsia
Intelligentsia,

00:01:06.730 --> 00:01:08.020
and what makes you guys--

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:11.440
like where you guys came from
to be where you're at today.

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:14.310
So to get into it right
now, this question

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:16.300
is for all of you guys.

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:18.160
How did you guys get
your start in coffee?

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:22.405
And how did you become
so successful in coffee?

00:01:22.405 --> 00:01:24.310
JAMES MCLAUGHLIN: Want
to start, Michael?

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:25.360
MICHAEL SHERIDAN:
I love the premise.

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:25.857
[LAUGHTER]

00:01:25.857 --> 00:01:26.354
JOHN PETRENKO: Yeah.

00:01:26.354 --> 00:01:28.840
MICHAEL SHERIDAN: How did I
become so successful in coffee?

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:31.090
Well first of all,
thanks for having us.

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:34.780
We're big fans of Google
and it's a real pleasure

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:35.830
to be here.

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:37.990
I love this question,
and it comes up

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:39.190
a lot at coffee events.

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:42.160
And I love it because usually
people's story in coffee

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:45.310
begins with something like,
well I was a liberal arts major,

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:48.380
or I was an arts studies major.

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:51.240
I was a philosophy major,
which of course means

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:54.820
I'm not qualified to do
anything other than press

00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:57.640
buttons on a coffee
machine at Starbucks.

00:01:57.640 --> 00:01:59.072
So a lot of people's coffee--

00:01:59.072 --> 00:02:01.030
everybody comes to coffee
from different places

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:03.280
because there isn't an Academy.

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:06.497
We met last week, the woman who
runs some of the food program

00:02:06.497 --> 00:02:08.830
here, and she went to the
Culinary Institute of America.

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:10.621
There isn't something
like that for coffee,

00:02:10.621 --> 00:02:12.790
so people come from all
kinds of different places.

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:16.370
I myself came from a
really bizarre direction,

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:19.450
which was international
development about 20 years ago,

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:21.310
as a volunteer in
Central America.

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:24.130
And I was placed in a coffee
village, a coffee growing

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:26.260
village with someone
who is obsessed

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:28.540
with coffee as a consumer.

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:32.170
And then I just pursued
it, and found a way

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:34.510
to work my way into
coffee through the channel

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:36.470
of international development.

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:38.650
So a lot of people
will start as baristas

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:41.230
and try to find their way
to where coffee is grown.

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:44.170
I started where coffee was grown
and found my way into places

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:47.020
where I work with baristas.

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:51.160
SAM SABORI: I'm the
arts major stereotype.

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:53.230
Yeah, I got into
coffee in college

00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:57.490
as a barista, that sustained
me through college.

00:02:57.490 --> 00:03:00.100
And then I got a job
at a specialty shop,

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:04.000
and I was kind of debating
further education.

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:06.160
So grad school, or--

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:07.610
I really wasn't sure.

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:10.780
So I decided to take a year
to have fun with coffee.

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:14.950
And then one year led to
two, and two led to three,

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:17.430
and then eventually I
got a job at Intelli,

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:20.467
and here I am 10 years later.

00:03:20.467 --> 00:03:23.050
JAMES MCLAUGHLIN: Yeah, I just
want to echo what Michael said.

00:03:23.050 --> 00:03:24.383
Thank you so much for having us.

00:03:24.383 --> 00:03:27.250
We're active users of many
of your Google products,

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:28.600
we love them all.

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:31.060
And we're neighbors, because
we actually roast probably

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:32.300
six blocks west of here.

00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:34.600
So it's really cool to be
here and talk to you guys

00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:36.400
a little bit about coffee.

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:39.540
I'm the philosophy
major of the group.

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:42.670
But I took a somewhat
unusual route to coffee.

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:44.410
I ended up practicing
law here in Chicago

00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:46.030
for a number of years.

00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:48.730
I was a regular
at Intelligentsia

00:03:48.730 --> 00:03:49.990
in Millennium Park.

00:03:49.990 --> 00:03:54.700
And in 2009, I quit my
job, moved with my wife

00:03:54.700 --> 00:03:57.550
down to Brazil, and
managed a coffee farm.

00:03:57.550 --> 00:04:02.920
So I ran a coffee farm for three
years and got the coffee bug,

00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:05.876
and really decided that that was
something I wanted to stay in.

00:04:05.876 --> 00:04:07.750
We ended up moving back
to the United States.

00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:12.014
And I was a huge fan
of Intelligentsia,

00:04:12.014 --> 00:04:13.930
just a true believer in
what the company stood

00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:17.560
for, all the things that
they were focused on,

00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:19.360
particularly the origin.

00:04:19.360 --> 00:04:21.529
And I sent a cold letter
to the company and said,

00:04:21.529 --> 00:04:24.140
hey, here's who I am, I'd
love to come work for you.

00:04:24.140 --> 00:04:27.490
And one thing led to
another, and here we are.

00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:28.990
JOHN PETRENKO: Very
cool, very cool.

00:04:28.990 --> 00:04:30.970
Now about Intelligentsia,
I'm curious like,

00:04:30.970 --> 00:04:33.280
what is the inspiration
behind Intelligentsia?

00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:34.725
What does it mean,
like, what does

00:04:34.725 --> 00:04:35.982
it mean to specialty coffee?

00:04:35.982 --> 00:04:36.940
JAMES MCLAUGHLIN: Yeah.

00:04:36.940 --> 00:04:37.970
It's a great question.

00:04:37.970 --> 00:04:40.390
I think to answer it,
I want to go back.

00:04:40.390 --> 00:04:44.950
I mean, coffee is one of the
world's most widely traded

00:04:44.950 --> 00:04:45.850
commodities.

00:04:45.850 --> 00:04:51.260
And when Intelligentsia
was founded 23 years ago,

00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:54.100
this idea of specialty
coffee really didn't exist.

00:04:54.100 --> 00:04:56.335
I mean, there were people
that we're trying to do--

00:04:56.335 --> 00:04:57.460
well, I shouldn't say that.

00:04:57.460 --> 00:04:59.230
I mean, Peet's
and Starbucks were

00:04:59.230 --> 00:05:01.330
sort of the second
wave, what's commonly

00:05:01.330 --> 00:05:04.510
called the second wave
of coffee, the upgrade

00:05:04.510 --> 00:05:05.410
from Folgers.

00:05:05.410 --> 00:05:09.350
And when Intelligentsia
was founded 23 years ago,

00:05:09.350 --> 00:05:11.020
it was this idea
that, hey, coffee

00:05:11.020 --> 00:05:13.150
can actually be something more.

00:05:13.150 --> 00:05:16.330
We really need to treat
coffee as a culinary product,

00:05:16.330 --> 00:05:20.590
much more so than Starbucks
and Peet's were doing.

00:05:20.590 --> 00:05:23.710
And it became--

00:05:23.710 --> 00:05:25.840
I think what
Intelligentsia has always

00:05:25.840 --> 00:05:28.180
stood for is this
idea that we want

00:05:28.180 --> 00:05:31.870
to keep the pristine ingredient
that comes from the farm as

00:05:31.870 --> 00:05:33.220
pure and as intact--

00:05:33.220 --> 00:05:35.650
and present that
to our customers--

00:05:35.650 --> 00:05:36.250
as possible.

00:05:36.250 --> 00:05:37.875
And that really gives
us an opportunity

00:05:37.875 --> 00:05:41.140
to showcase all the different
varietals and origins,

00:05:41.140 --> 00:05:43.646
and all the different taste
characteristics that I know

00:05:43.646 --> 00:05:44.770
you're super familiar with.

00:05:44.770 --> 00:05:46.180
JOHN PETRENKO: Yeah.

00:05:46.180 --> 00:05:50.870
JAMES MCLAUGHLIN: And you know,
one of the things that we truly

00:05:50.870 --> 00:05:52.730
believe is that we
have the opportunity

00:05:52.730 --> 00:05:56.924
to make change in the world
through extraordinary coffee.

00:05:56.924 --> 00:05:59.090
I mean, when we talk about
coffee at Intelligentsia,

00:05:59.090 --> 00:06:01.130
it is always
extraordinary coffee,

00:06:01.130 --> 00:06:04.700
because we are buying,
roasting, and serving

00:06:04.700 --> 00:06:06.390
the best coffee in the world.

00:06:06.390 --> 00:06:10.010
And we believe that really
through our trading model,

00:06:10.010 --> 00:06:12.410
the way that we buy
and sell coffees,

00:06:12.410 --> 00:06:16.010
we can have a huge impact on
the communities in countries

00:06:16.010 --> 00:06:20.000
all across the world and
give farmers an opportunity

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:23.600
to make a living and a
livelihood that is totally

00:06:23.600 --> 00:06:26.120
disconnected from
that commodity market

00:06:26.120 --> 00:06:28.590
that I talked about
at the beginning.

00:06:28.590 --> 00:06:31.190
So I think, you know, it's
really about treating coffee

00:06:31.190 --> 00:06:34.280
as a culinary product that
carries through in, I think,

00:06:34.280 --> 00:06:35.270
everything that we do.

00:06:35.270 --> 00:06:36.353
JOHN PETRENKO: Definitely.

00:06:36.353 --> 00:06:37.910
JAMES MCLAUGHLIN:
At our coffee bars,

00:06:37.910 --> 00:06:41.000
we were really at the
forefront of introducing

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:43.514
high design into coffee bars.

00:06:43.514 --> 00:06:45.680
If you go to our coffee
bars, everyone is different.

00:06:45.680 --> 00:06:49.310
We try to design coffee bars
for the specific neighborhood,

00:06:49.310 --> 00:06:52.910
and make it feel
like that customer--

00:06:52.910 --> 00:06:55.190
that's their coffee bar,
that's their Intelligentsia.

00:06:55.190 --> 00:06:58.010
It's not a cookie cutter model.

00:06:58.010 --> 00:07:00.837
And so all these
little details--

00:07:00.837 --> 00:07:03.170
you know, I like to say that
if a customer knows nothing

00:07:03.170 --> 00:07:06.140
about Intelligentsia and you
walk into one of our shops,

00:07:06.140 --> 00:07:08.930
hopefully that customer stops
as soon as they cross the door

00:07:08.930 --> 00:07:11.240
threshold and they say,
wait, something's different,

00:07:11.240 --> 00:07:13.460
this doesn't feel like
a common coffee shop.

00:07:13.460 --> 00:07:16.700
And that's something that
we want to have happen,

00:07:16.700 --> 00:07:20.120
because we want to elevate the
coffee experience to something

00:07:20.120 --> 00:07:21.590
culinary.

00:07:21.590 --> 00:07:24.587
And it really carries through
to all the small details.

00:07:24.587 --> 00:07:27.170
We don't have any cups, but the
cups that we use in our shops,

00:07:27.170 --> 00:07:30.050
that was stuff that we
designed because we didn't like

00:07:30.050 --> 00:07:32.724
the way the cups felt in
our hands, the ones that

00:07:32.724 --> 00:07:33.890
were commonly on the market.

00:07:33.890 --> 00:07:36.389
So we designed one where you
had a place to rest your thumb.

00:07:36.389 --> 00:07:39.020
We designed the inside
so that you could easily

00:07:39.020 --> 00:07:40.160
pour latte art.

00:07:40.160 --> 00:07:44.240
And again, the presentation was
something that was different.

00:07:44.240 --> 00:07:46.670
Another, I think, good
example is the menu

00:07:46.670 --> 00:07:48.260
that we print every
day at our shop.

00:07:48.260 --> 00:07:49.820
We get to pick the
coffees we serve,

00:07:49.820 --> 00:07:52.230
and it's something different
each and every day.

00:07:52.230 --> 00:07:55.586
And it's this idea that, hey,
coffee is not just coffee.

00:07:55.586 --> 00:07:56.960
There's coffee
from Peru, there's

00:07:56.960 --> 00:07:59.480
coffee from El Salvador,
there's coffee from Rwanda.

00:07:59.480 --> 00:08:01.310
And then there's
50 different levels

00:08:01.310 --> 00:08:03.890
below that, that we're
just really starting

00:08:03.890 --> 00:08:04.849
to scratch the surface.

00:08:04.849 --> 00:08:05.806
JOHN PETRENKO: Totally.

00:08:05.806 --> 00:08:07.730
I mean, and that leads
to my next question.

00:08:07.730 --> 00:08:10.970
And this is just like, a
coffee fanboy question.

00:08:10.970 --> 00:08:12.470
What is your favorite coffee?

00:08:12.470 --> 00:08:15.510
What is your favorite process,
region, and brewing technique?

00:08:15.510 --> 00:08:18.650
You know, I love making
a Kalita Wave at home,

00:08:18.650 --> 00:08:19.824
Costa Rica is my favorite.

00:08:19.824 --> 00:08:20.740
I love a pulp natural.

00:08:20.740 --> 00:08:21.890
[LAUGHTER]

00:08:21.890 --> 00:08:24.840
All three of you guys,
I'd really like to know.

00:08:24.840 --> 00:08:26.330
JAMES MCLAUGHLIN: Yeah.

00:08:26.330 --> 00:08:28.790
SAM SABORI: I honestly think
you can make great coffee

00:08:28.790 --> 00:08:30.767
on any device, it's
just, how much time do

00:08:30.767 --> 00:08:31.850
you want to spend with it?

00:08:31.850 --> 00:08:34.919
Some are easier than others.

00:08:34.919 --> 00:08:37.640
I personally, I
kind of fluctuate

00:08:37.640 --> 00:08:42.200
between a Chemex
or a Kalita Wave.

00:08:42.200 --> 00:08:45.110
I tend to prefer smaller
doses, so I'll usually

00:08:45.110 --> 00:08:50.006
dose around 22, 23 grams
and run a 1 to 18.25

00:08:50.006 --> 00:08:51.380
ratio if you guys
are interested.

00:08:51.380 --> 00:08:52.546
JOHN PETRENKO: There you go.

00:08:52.546 --> 00:08:54.590
[LAUGHTER]

00:08:54.590 --> 00:08:56.960
SAM SABORI: And as far
as favorite coffee,

00:08:56.960 --> 00:09:00.290
I would say Kenya is
probably my favorite.

00:09:00.290 --> 00:09:01.940
It just has so much power.

00:09:01.940 --> 00:09:03.782
There's tons of sweetness,
tons of acidity,

00:09:03.782 --> 00:09:05.240
and there's just
so much to develop

00:09:05.240 --> 00:09:08.240
from a roast perspective
and a brewing perspective.

00:09:08.240 --> 00:09:09.850
JOHN PETRENKO: Definitely.

00:09:09.850 --> 00:09:11.850
MICHAEL SHERIDAN: I don't
want to go after that.

00:09:11.850 --> 00:09:12.870
[LAUGHTER]

00:09:12.870 --> 00:09:15.240
18.25 to 1.

00:09:15.240 --> 00:09:18.270
I have a little less
precision in my own habits.

00:09:18.270 --> 00:09:21.980
I'll say that in our office,
the culture is to share too.

00:09:21.980 --> 00:09:23.490
We have a nice
brew bar, and we've

00:09:23.490 --> 00:09:26.310
got every different kind
of manual brewing method

00:09:26.310 --> 00:09:27.900
available.

00:09:27.900 --> 00:09:31.350
So the Chemex tends to
be my method of choice,

00:09:31.350 --> 00:09:34.706
and I bring it back and share it
with my neighbors where I sit.

00:09:34.706 --> 00:09:37.080
It's a little bit unforgiving
sometimes, hard to dial in.

00:09:37.080 --> 00:09:39.960
I've done a lot more work
with the Kalita lately.

00:09:39.960 --> 00:09:41.030
But I just can't--

00:09:41.030 --> 00:09:43.980
anytime there's a fresh crop
Ethiopia on the coffee bar,

00:09:43.980 --> 00:09:44.820
I can't pass it up.

00:09:44.820 --> 00:09:47.400
And we've got a couple that
we're brewing up for you here

00:09:47.400 --> 00:09:51.900
today, including one that is
just incredibly floral and just

00:09:51.900 --> 00:09:52.770
endlessly sweet.

00:09:52.770 --> 00:09:55.020
And for a lot of
people, Ethiopia's

00:09:55.020 --> 00:09:58.690
a challenging coffee because
it doesn't taste like coffee.

00:09:58.690 --> 00:10:00.910
It's very complex and
it's got a lot going on.

00:10:00.910 --> 00:10:03.711
And for some people, it's
not an everyday coffee.

00:10:03.711 --> 00:10:05.460
But if I could have
one coffee on a desert

00:10:05.460 --> 00:10:07.990
island for the rest of my
life, it would be the Ethiopia.

00:10:07.990 --> 00:10:08.400
JOHN PETRENKO: Perfect.

00:10:08.400 --> 00:10:09.480
JAMES MCLAUGHLIN: Yeah.

00:10:09.480 --> 00:10:10.620
I'd second that.

00:10:10.620 --> 00:10:13.620
I think a washed Ethiopian
is probably my favorite.

00:10:13.620 --> 00:10:16.890
And I personally prefer the
Chemex, but I agree with Sam,

00:10:16.890 --> 00:10:19.042
you can make great
coffee on anything.

00:10:19.042 --> 00:10:21.000
But if I had to choose
one, it would be Chemex.

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:22.708
JOHN PETRENKO: Chemex,
yeah, makes sense.

00:10:22.708 --> 00:10:24.280
Yeah.

00:10:24.280 --> 00:10:25.980
So this is for Michael.

00:10:25.980 --> 00:10:27.570
I was just wondering,
can you tell us

00:10:27.570 --> 00:10:31.022
about Intelligentsia's
model on sourcing coffee?

00:10:31.022 --> 00:10:31.980
MICHAEL SHERIDAN: Yeah.

00:10:31.980 --> 00:10:32.910
I thought you'd never ask.

00:10:32.910 --> 00:10:33.785
JOHN PETRENKO: Right?

00:10:33.785 --> 00:10:35.910
[LAUGHTER]

00:10:35.910 --> 00:10:37.410
MICHAEL SHERIDAN:
I mentioned before

00:10:37.410 --> 00:10:40.280
that I got into coffee through
international development.

00:10:40.280 --> 00:10:43.980
And what I neglected to say,
was that I spent 14 years

00:10:43.980 --> 00:10:45.720
with an international
aid agency,

00:10:45.720 --> 00:10:48.596
and I spent 12 of those
years working on coffee.

00:10:48.596 --> 00:10:50.220
And it was kind of
an interesting thing

00:10:50.220 --> 00:10:52.710
because I was living in
Guatemala for four years,

00:10:52.710 --> 00:10:54.706
and in South America
for five years,

00:10:54.706 --> 00:10:57.330
and I was leading projects with
thousands of smallholder coffee

00:10:57.330 --> 00:10:58.216
growers.

00:10:58.216 --> 00:11:00.090
One of the things that's
amazing about coffee

00:11:00.090 --> 00:11:02.610
from an impact perspective
or a development perspective,

00:11:02.610 --> 00:11:04.050
is that it's a
poor person's crop.

00:11:04.050 --> 00:11:06.600
It's primarily grown
by smallholder farmers

00:11:06.600 --> 00:11:08.790
who have maybe three,
or four, or five acres.

00:11:08.790 --> 00:11:10.740
So there's incredible
developmental potential

00:11:10.740 --> 00:11:14.100
in coffee in general, and
specifically in our model.

00:11:14.100 --> 00:11:16.290
But that's why a development
agency was so deeply

00:11:16.290 --> 00:11:17.090
invested in coffee.

00:11:17.090 --> 00:11:18.840
But one of the nice
things about that work

00:11:18.840 --> 00:11:21.090
was, it was kind of
like Switzerland.

00:11:21.090 --> 00:11:22.200
We were totally neutral.

00:11:22.200 --> 00:11:24.062
And everybody in
the coffee industry

00:11:24.062 --> 00:11:26.520
is like, oh you're working on
coffee to make coffee better,

00:11:26.520 --> 00:11:28.800
more impactful for
smallholders, how can we help?

00:11:28.800 --> 00:11:30.770
And so people would
fling open their doors.

00:11:30.770 --> 00:11:32.810
And I had over those 12
years, the opportunity

00:11:32.810 --> 00:11:36.870
to work with roasters
of all shapes and sizes.

00:11:36.870 --> 00:11:40.684
And I think that
Intelligentsia's sourcing

00:11:40.684 --> 00:11:43.350
program is awesome, but it's not
because I work for the company.

00:11:43.350 --> 00:11:45.475
I work for the company
because I think the sourcing

00:11:45.475 --> 00:11:47.270
program is awesome.

00:11:47.270 --> 00:11:49.320
As I did more and
more of that work

00:11:49.320 --> 00:11:52.050
and I decided to make a
move to the private sector,

00:11:52.050 --> 00:11:53.550
there were really
very few companies

00:11:53.550 --> 00:11:55.740
that from a developmental
perspective were interesting.

00:11:55.740 --> 00:11:57.948
And Intelligentsia was really
at the top of the list.

00:11:57.948 --> 00:12:01.242
So we did get the questions
for this in advance,

00:12:01.242 --> 00:12:02.700
so I did get to
glance at it, and I

00:12:02.700 --> 00:12:04.800
made a long list of things
that make our sourcing program

00:12:04.800 --> 00:12:05.350
awesome.

00:12:05.350 --> 00:12:07.940
I'm going to try to limit
myself to like four or five here

00:12:07.940 --> 00:12:09.023
and just hit them quickly.

00:12:09.023 --> 00:12:11.430
But I could go down
to like 17 or 18 later

00:12:11.430 --> 00:12:15.210
if you're interested
after we break.

00:12:15.210 --> 00:12:17.230
The first thing I'll
say about our program

00:12:17.230 --> 00:12:20.320
is, our program is
called Direct Trade.

00:12:20.320 --> 00:12:22.406
And it's language,
or it's a term that's

00:12:22.406 --> 00:12:24.780
used a lot in the industry
now, but really Intelligentsia

00:12:24.780 --> 00:12:26.960
developed the concept.

00:12:26.960 --> 00:12:28.499
One of our colleagues,
Geoff Watts,

00:12:28.499 --> 00:12:30.540
was sort of the primary
intellectual and material

00:12:30.540 --> 00:12:31.374
author of the model.

00:12:31.374 --> 00:12:32.956
And the most important
part about that

00:12:32.956 --> 00:12:34.480
is, the direct part
of Direct Trade.

00:12:34.480 --> 00:12:36.250
And it's just what
it sounds like.

00:12:36.250 --> 00:12:39.090
We visit every one of our direct
trade partners every year,

00:12:39.090 --> 00:12:41.444
on their farms, in their
mills, and we work together

00:12:41.444 --> 00:12:43.860
to build the beautiful coffees
that we serve in our coffee

00:12:43.860 --> 00:12:46.350
bars and that you'll try today.

00:12:46.350 --> 00:12:50.700
And from a sourcing
perspective, I

00:12:50.700 --> 00:12:53.446
believe it's the most reliable
way to get great coffee.

00:12:53.446 --> 00:12:54.820
From a developmental
perspective,

00:12:54.820 --> 00:12:58.034
there's simply no
substitute for a situation

00:12:58.034 --> 00:13:00.450
in which a buyer is sitting
across the table from a grower

00:13:00.450 --> 00:13:02.530
and talking about what
they're going to do together,

00:13:02.530 --> 00:13:04.821
how we're going to create
quality, what kind of volumes

00:13:04.821 --> 00:13:07.830
we're going to work on
together this year, what

00:13:07.830 --> 00:13:09.630
are the specific
economic practices

00:13:09.630 --> 00:13:12.450
or post harvest practices
that can lead to quality.

00:13:12.450 --> 00:13:14.730
And there's just something
magical about that face

00:13:14.730 --> 00:13:16.530
to face contact.

00:13:16.530 --> 00:13:18.420
There are a lot of
certification programs

00:13:18.420 --> 00:13:23.490
out there, fair trade,
bird friendly, shade grown.

00:13:23.490 --> 00:13:24.480
They're all good.

00:13:24.480 --> 00:13:26.520
But for a lot of
people, that is a way

00:13:26.520 --> 00:13:28.355
to outsource relationships.

00:13:28.355 --> 00:13:29.730
People do that
because they don't

00:13:29.730 --> 00:13:31.579
visit the farms every year.

00:13:31.579 --> 00:13:33.120
It's really fundamental
to our model,

00:13:33.120 --> 00:13:34.744
and it's the way that
we build quality.

00:13:34.744 --> 00:13:38.920
So the direct in direct
trade is important.

00:13:38.920 --> 00:13:40.950
The second thing
I'll say is, that's

00:13:40.950 --> 00:13:43.680
really important about
the program, is quality.

00:13:43.680 --> 00:13:46.880
We believe that-- as James
said, he mentioned the word

00:13:46.880 --> 00:13:48.660
culinary five or six times.

00:13:48.660 --> 00:13:50.580
It's such a bedrock
belief of ours,

00:13:50.580 --> 00:13:52.320
that coffee is a
culinary product.

00:13:52.320 --> 00:13:55.065
And it is a commodity, but
not the coffee that we source,

00:13:55.065 --> 00:13:56.940
not the coffee that we
serve, and not the way

00:13:56.940 --> 00:13:57.900
we think about coffee.

00:13:57.900 --> 00:14:00.580
We think about coffee
as something elevated.

00:14:00.580 --> 00:14:03.070
It's a gastronomic
product, and the way

00:14:03.070 --> 00:14:05.310
we serve it is an
elevated process.

00:14:05.310 --> 00:14:08.010
And we build our partnerships
with that in mind.

00:14:08.010 --> 00:14:10.340
We find people who share
our obsession with quality,

00:14:10.340 --> 00:14:13.970
and we build relationships
with them that last.

00:14:13.970 --> 00:14:17.060
For us, we think it's the most
important and effective way

00:14:17.060 --> 00:14:18.650
to be successful
in the marketplace.

00:14:18.650 --> 00:14:21.050
And it turns out, the same
thing is true for growers.

00:14:21.050 --> 00:14:23.520
The most reliable value
proposition for growers

00:14:23.520 --> 00:14:26.540
is to produce quality
year after year.

00:14:26.540 --> 00:14:29.950
The third thing is, the
way we trade coffee,

00:14:29.950 --> 00:14:31.255
or our commercial contracts.

00:14:31.255 --> 00:14:32.630
And in order to
understand what's

00:14:32.630 --> 00:14:34.835
special about the
way we do it, you

00:14:34.835 --> 00:14:36.710
need to understand a
little bit about the way

00:14:36.710 --> 00:14:37.850
the market normally works.

00:14:37.850 --> 00:14:39.516
And the market the
market normally works

00:14:39.516 --> 00:14:41.270
is, it's really intermediated.

00:14:41.270 --> 00:14:44.720
Coffee growers rarely
taste their own coffee.

00:14:44.720 --> 00:14:47.790
They almost never
meet coffee buyers.

00:14:47.790 --> 00:14:49.430
They'll sell their
coffee to someone

00:14:49.430 --> 00:14:51.170
in the town plaza,
who will maybe

00:14:51.170 --> 00:14:54.290
resell it to a miller,
who will then export it.

00:14:54.290 --> 00:14:58.340
And the two ends of
the chain don't meet.

00:14:58.340 --> 00:15:01.760
We build this model
directly with growers.

00:15:01.760 --> 00:15:04.190
And we build
incentives for quality.

00:15:04.190 --> 00:15:07.460
It's not just that we pay
more, we pay high prices,

00:15:07.460 --> 00:15:09.050
we pay stable prices.

00:15:09.050 --> 00:15:13.280
Normally the prices that growers
get, the market graph in coffee

00:15:13.280 --> 00:15:16.100
looks a little bit
like a seismograph

00:15:16.100 --> 00:15:17.156
or a polygraph test.

00:15:17.156 --> 00:15:19.280
It looks like this, and
it's very hard for a grower

00:15:19.280 --> 00:15:22.040
to make a living with
prices that go up and down.

00:15:22.040 --> 00:15:24.157
We pay stable, high fixed
prices so that growers

00:15:24.157 --> 00:15:26.240
know what they're going
to make from us this year,

00:15:26.240 --> 00:15:27.470
what they're going to make
next year, what they going

00:15:27.470 --> 00:15:28.772
to make the year after that.

00:15:28.772 --> 00:15:30.230
And the growers in
our supply chain

00:15:30.230 --> 00:15:34.160
have something that is a rare
and beautiful thing, which

00:15:34.160 --> 00:15:37.070
is the ability to make
plans for the future.

00:15:37.070 --> 00:15:40.290
And most growers are
not in that position.

00:15:40.290 --> 00:15:42.470
So I'm going to
stop there at three.

00:15:42.470 --> 00:15:46.100
I could go on, but there is one
more that I want to mention.

00:15:46.100 --> 00:15:47.570
It's called ECW.

00:15:47.570 --> 00:15:51.830
One of the amazing things for us
is that we work with some of--

00:15:51.830 --> 00:15:54.610
James said, we source and serve
the best coffees in the world.

00:15:54.610 --> 00:15:56.734
And we work with some of
the most celebrated coffee

00:15:56.734 --> 00:15:57.926
growers in the world.

00:15:57.926 --> 00:15:59.300
In 10 countries
around the world,

00:15:59.300 --> 00:16:00.924
there's a coffee
competition every year

00:16:00.924 --> 00:16:02.979
called the Cup of Excellence.

00:16:02.979 --> 00:16:04.520
And growers from
all over the country

00:16:04.520 --> 00:16:06.231
will submit samples
of their coffee.

00:16:06.231 --> 00:16:08.480
There is a national jury
that will go through it three

00:16:08.480 --> 00:16:10.100
or four times, and
they'll identify

00:16:10.100 --> 00:16:12.650
a small number of lots that
qualify for the final jury.

00:16:12.650 --> 00:16:15.150
And then international cuppers
come from all over the world,

00:16:15.150 --> 00:16:16.858
they sample the coffees,
they grade them,

00:16:16.858 --> 00:16:19.190
and then they're
sold at auction.

00:16:19.190 --> 00:16:22.160
We have like, a dozen different
Cup of Excellence winners

00:16:22.160 --> 00:16:23.280
in our supply network.

00:16:23.280 --> 00:16:27.081
And we once a year get everybody
in our supply chain network

00:16:27.081 --> 00:16:29.330
together for an event we
call the Extraordinary Coffee

00:16:29.330 --> 00:16:30.260
Workshop.

00:16:30.260 --> 00:16:33.566
We just did our 10th annual
one last month in Bolivia.

00:16:33.566 --> 00:16:35.690
And when you get there,
it's like the all-star game

00:16:35.690 --> 00:16:36.216
of coffee.

00:16:36.216 --> 00:16:38.090
It's like, people are
looking around the room

00:16:38.090 --> 00:16:41.150
and they're going, oh yeah, it's
you, I know about your coffee

00:16:41.150 --> 00:16:43.190
and you won Cup of
Excellence in Honduras,

00:16:43.190 --> 00:16:46.509
and you won Cup of
Excellence in Rwanda.

00:16:46.509 --> 00:16:48.300
And we've been doing
this now for 10 years.

00:16:48.300 --> 00:16:49.883
A lot of these people
are people we've

00:16:49.883 --> 00:16:52.430
traded with for 12 or 15 years.

00:16:52.430 --> 00:16:54.350
And they haven't just
become friends with us,

00:16:54.350 --> 00:16:56.580
but they've become
friends with one another.

00:16:56.580 --> 00:16:59.300
And so it's like, it's sort
of a part family reunion, part

00:16:59.300 --> 00:17:01.610
coffee geek week,
where we geek out

00:17:01.610 --> 00:17:04.470
on all the details of coffee
agronomy and processing,

00:17:04.470 --> 00:17:06.470
and try to find little
things that we can unlock

00:17:06.470 --> 00:17:08.520
to make our coffee better.

00:17:08.520 --> 00:17:11.150
And that level of transparency,
and that level of exchange

00:17:11.150 --> 00:17:13.822
where the best in the world
are learning from the best,

00:17:13.822 --> 00:17:16.280
and we're facilitating it, it's
something that just doesn't

00:17:16.280 --> 00:17:18.530
happen anywhere else in coffee.

00:17:18.530 --> 00:17:21.200
So that's one of the
most extraordinary things

00:17:21.200 --> 00:17:23.690
that Intelligentsia does.

00:17:23.690 --> 00:17:25.880
JAMES MCLAUGHLIN: And if
I could just add, I mean,

00:17:25.880 --> 00:17:27.560
from the perspective
of a grower--

00:17:27.560 --> 00:17:31.470
because I was a grower
for a number of years--

00:17:31.470 --> 00:17:34.520
what Michael just described
probably doesn't sound that--

00:17:34.520 --> 00:17:37.084
like, it all make sense, right?

00:17:37.084 --> 00:17:39.000
You have a buyer sitting
across from a seller,

00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:42.650
they were paying prices based on
quality, that all kind of makes

00:17:42.650 --> 00:17:44.150
sense intuitively.

00:17:44.150 --> 00:17:47.450
But the point that
I want to emphasize,

00:17:47.450 --> 00:17:50.692
is that that 15 years
ago did not exist.

00:17:50.692 --> 00:17:51.650
MICHAEL SHERIDAN: Yeah.

00:17:51.650 --> 00:17:54.320
JAMES MCLAUGHLIN: Everything--
as Michael said-- was traded--

00:17:54.320 --> 00:17:56.720
all coffee was really traded
through intermediaries.

00:17:56.720 --> 00:17:59.540
And so producers
really had no idea

00:17:59.540 --> 00:18:01.430
where their coffee
would end up going.

00:18:01.430 --> 00:18:03.830
And you had all
these intermediaries

00:18:03.830 --> 00:18:06.830
throughout the process that
were stepping on the product

00:18:06.830 --> 00:18:08.390
and making a little
bit of money.

00:18:08.390 --> 00:18:11.770
And really, the brilliance
of the Direct Trade model

00:18:11.770 --> 00:18:14.080
that Jeff really
thought about was,

00:18:14.080 --> 00:18:17.120
we're going to cut all those
people out and push that value

00:18:17.120 --> 00:18:18.680
back to the producer.

00:18:18.680 --> 00:18:21.830
And that really changes
the game as a farmer,

00:18:21.830 --> 00:18:24.440
because you do have a partner
that you know is coming back

00:18:24.440 --> 00:18:25.440
each and every year.

00:18:25.440 --> 00:18:27.264
And you can make smart
business decisions,

00:18:27.264 --> 00:18:29.180
you can start thinking
about it as a business.

00:18:29.180 --> 00:18:31.500
I'm going to save
up my money and I'm

00:18:31.500 --> 00:18:32.750
going to build a new wet mill.

00:18:32.750 --> 00:18:34.730
Or I'm going to plant more land.

00:18:34.730 --> 00:18:35.840
MICHAEL SHERIDAN: Yeah.

00:18:35.840 --> 00:18:36.590
JAMES MCLAUGHLIN: And
when you're really

00:18:36.590 --> 00:18:38.049
at the whim of the
commodity market

00:18:38.049 --> 00:18:39.464
and you don't know
if the price is

00:18:39.464 --> 00:18:40.940
going to be high
or low next year,

00:18:40.940 --> 00:18:42.470
you can't really run a business.

00:18:42.470 --> 00:18:45.957
You're really just trying to
scrape by and make a living.

00:18:45.957 --> 00:18:48.540
And I think-- you know, I know
that you know this really well.

00:18:48.540 --> 00:18:50.360
But it's one of
the best parts, I

00:18:50.360 --> 00:18:52.460
think, about working in
coffee, because you really

00:18:52.460 --> 00:18:57.320
do see the impact that our model
is having in these communities

00:18:57.320 --> 00:18:59.390
with these farmers.

00:18:59.390 --> 00:19:03.470
And you know, we carry that
through to the end consumer.

00:19:03.470 --> 00:19:08.420
We expect consumers to sort of
share in paying higher prices,

00:19:08.420 --> 00:19:11.150
because we're paying higher
prices to the producers.

00:19:11.150 --> 00:19:17.600
But so far, consumers seem to be
willing to sort of step with us

00:19:17.600 --> 00:19:18.100
in this.

00:19:18.100 --> 00:19:20.039
So I think it's--

00:19:20.039 --> 00:19:21.830
some of this stuff
sounds really intuitive,

00:19:21.830 --> 00:19:24.380
but it's such a radical
departure for where

00:19:24.380 --> 00:19:26.000
coffee was 15 years ago.

00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:26.180
JOHN PETRENKO: Definitely.

00:19:26.180 --> 00:19:27.620
MICHAEL SHERIDAN: And
I think it's important,

00:19:27.620 --> 00:19:29.000
it wasn't just 15 years ago.

00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:31.480
I mean, most of coffee is
still traded that way today.

00:19:31.480 --> 00:19:31.790
JAMES MCLAUGHLIN: That's true.

00:19:31.790 --> 00:19:33.748
MICHAEL SHERIDAN: And so
the developmental work

00:19:33.748 --> 00:19:36.890
that I was doing in the field in
southern Colombia, for example,

00:19:36.890 --> 00:19:39.927
with people who were coffee
growers for 30 years,

00:19:39.927 --> 00:19:41.760
and every year they'd
go and they'd harvest,

00:19:41.760 --> 00:19:43.550
they'd put the coffee on a
mule, and they'd take it down

00:19:43.550 --> 00:19:45.680
to the town plaza, and they'd
sell it for whatever price

00:19:45.680 --> 00:19:47.030
was written on the slate there.

00:19:47.030 --> 00:19:50.600
And nothing had changed, it had
been like that for generations.

00:19:50.600 --> 00:19:52.520
And then in that
context, I would

00:19:52.520 --> 00:19:53.754
come in and I would bring--

00:19:53.754 --> 00:19:55.670
when I was working for
the development agency,

00:19:55.670 --> 00:19:57.470
I brought
Intelligentsia with me.

00:19:57.470 --> 00:19:59.259
Just said, hey,
explain your model.

00:19:59.259 --> 00:20:00.800
Well, here's what
we would do, here's

00:20:00.800 --> 00:20:05.164
what we look for, here's how we
work, here's the prices we pay,

00:20:05.164 --> 00:20:06.830
here's the quality
requirements we have.

00:20:06.830 --> 00:20:10.590
It's not easy, you have to be
committed to quality with us.

00:20:10.590 --> 00:20:11.840
Is anybody interested in that?

00:20:11.840 --> 00:20:12.710
Everyone looked at
each other like,

00:20:12.710 --> 00:20:14.000
is that a trick
question, of course we're

00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:14.791
interested in that.

00:20:14.791 --> 00:20:18.230
It's fundamentally revolutionary
in terms of that context.

00:20:18.230 --> 00:20:19.730
The other thing
that James mentioned

00:20:19.730 --> 00:20:22.430
is the idea of cutting
out the intermediaries.

00:20:22.430 --> 00:20:24.950
We still do, in some cases,
rely on intermediaries

00:20:24.950 --> 00:20:27.290
to do things like transport
the coffee for us.

00:20:27.290 --> 00:20:29.319
But the key point
is, that dialogue

00:20:29.319 --> 00:20:30.860
and getting back to
where it started,

00:20:30.860 --> 00:20:33.260
the idea of the direct
part of direct trade.

00:20:33.260 --> 00:20:35.900
If you think about a
traditional commodity chain,

00:20:35.900 --> 00:20:38.690
there may be six or
eight different actors

00:20:38.690 --> 00:20:41.660
between the coffee
bar and the grower.

00:20:41.660 --> 00:20:44.870
And the traditional model
is that those actors

00:20:44.870 --> 00:20:47.462
in the middle of the chain
make money off of the growers.

00:20:47.462 --> 00:20:49.670
We're trying to make money
together with the growers,

00:20:49.670 --> 00:20:51.500
and to be competitive
as a chain.

00:20:51.500 --> 00:20:57.237
But even in other chains where
there's a collaborative spirit,

00:20:57.237 --> 00:20:58.820
where there isn't
that direct contact,

00:20:58.820 --> 00:21:00.290
it's like a game of telephone.

00:21:00.290 --> 00:21:03.140
And you are all
educated people, you

00:21:03.140 --> 00:21:06.645
work for Google, you
share a world view.

00:21:06.645 --> 00:21:08.270
You share some aspects
of understanding

00:21:08.270 --> 00:21:09.230
how the world works.

00:21:09.230 --> 00:21:12.140
If we played a game of
telephone in here, our message,

00:21:12.140 --> 00:21:13.960
even a simple message
would break down.

00:21:13.960 --> 00:21:15.740
And if you think about
a supply chain that

00:21:15.740 --> 00:21:18.180
reaches across multiple
countries, multiple languages,

00:21:18.180 --> 00:21:21.350
different classes, it's very
hard to convey clear messages.

00:21:21.350 --> 00:21:23.014
And so us closing
the circle, and being

00:21:23.014 --> 00:21:25.430
able to sit down with the
grower and communicate directly,

00:21:25.430 --> 00:21:27.929
it's like for the grower,
it's like going into an exam

00:21:27.929 --> 00:21:29.220
with the answers ahead of time.

00:21:29.220 --> 00:21:31.120
They know exactly what the
market is demanding of them.

00:21:31.120 --> 00:21:33.536
There's no distortion of the
market's signal, it's direct,

00:21:33.536 --> 00:21:37.070
it's clear, and people can make
decisions and take decisions

00:21:37.070 --> 00:21:37.990
on the farm.

00:21:37.990 --> 00:21:40.140
They have much higher
probability of success.

00:21:40.140 --> 00:21:42.140
And that's the idea of
building quality together

00:21:42.140 --> 00:21:44.370
that's so revolutionary
about Intelligentsia.

00:21:44.370 --> 00:21:47.240
There are a lot of people
who serve quality coffee,

00:21:47.240 --> 00:21:49.427
but they're taking what
emerges from a process

00:21:49.427 --> 00:21:51.260
that they have no control
or influence over,

00:21:51.260 --> 00:21:53.390
whereas we're building
the coffees every year

00:21:53.390 --> 00:21:55.390
from the ground up,
beginning when the coffee is

00:21:55.390 --> 00:21:57.902
a seed and still on the plant.

00:21:57.902 --> 00:21:59.610
JAMES MCLAUGHLIN: And
one last point, I--

00:21:59.610 --> 00:22:00.360
JOHN PETRENKO: Of course.

00:22:00.360 --> 00:22:01.520
JAMES MCLAUGHLIN:
But just to build

00:22:01.520 --> 00:22:02.960
on something Michael
said, I think

00:22:02.960 --> 00:22:04.640
that the other piece
that's really important

00:22:04.640 --> 00:22:05.600
is the quality piece.

00:22:05.600 --> 00:22:10.040
Because it's easy for us to talk
and say, we can go to producers

00:22:10.040 --> 00:22:12.380
and say, here's our
quality expectations.

00:22:12.380 --> 00:22:15.980
But it's actually pretty hard to
meet our quality expectations.

00:22:15.980 --> 00:22:18.480
I think-- Sam can say
this better than--

00:22:18.480 --> 00:22:20.310
I don't know the stats as well.

00:22:20.310 --> 00:22:23.540
But I think we got
something like 3,000 samples

00:22:23.540 --> 00:22:26.540
that we received into our
lab to evaluate and decide

00:22:26.540 --> 00:22:28.220
whether we're going
to buy or not.

00:22:28.220 --> 00:22:32.360
We select like 1% of
those to actually buy.

00:22:32.360 --> 00:22:35.030
So it's not easy to
make the cut, which

00:22:35.030 --> 00:22:37.940
is I think, your point
about the all-star team.

00:22:37.940 --> 00:22:41.810
But we're committed
partners with the producers.

00:22:41.810 --> 00:22:46.100
And so it often takes us
four to five years working

00:22:46.100 --> 00:22:48.810
with a producer and saying,
look, we believe in you,

00:22:48.810 --> 00:22:51.680
you have the right
characteristics that we found

00:22:51.680 --> 00:22:53.330
for you to be
successful, we're going

00:22:53.330 --> 00:22:57.080
to help train you on how
you produce quality coffee.

00:22:57.080 --> 00:22:58.790
And often it takes
four or five years

00:22:58.790 --> 00:23:01.310
before we'll actually
get a container of coffee

00:23:01.310 --> 00:23:02.870
that we buy.

00:23:02.870 --> 00:23:05.330
But it's something that,
again, this idea that we're

00:23:05.330 --> 00:23:08.030
partners with the producers.

00:23:08.030 --> 00:23:11.060
And the quality
road is not easy.

00:23:11.060 --> 00:23:12.660
JOHN PETRENKO: Right on, nice.

00:23:12.660 --> 00:23:14.927
Well, next question I have
is going to be for Sam.

00:23:14.927 --> 00:23:17.510
I'm very curious on like, what
do you look for in the roasting

00:23:17.510 --> 00:23:18.010
process?

00:23:18.010 --> 00:23:20.090
What's your philosophy
in roasting and quality

00:23:20.090 --> 00:23:21.560
control with Intelligentsia?

00:23:21.560 --> 00:23:24.870
And follow up, what is your
favorite coffee to roast?

00:23:24.870 --> 00:23:25.775
SAM SABORI: OK.

00:23:25.775 --> 00:23:29.600
You know, we've echoed it a
few times, but the sentiment

00:23:29.600 --> 00:23:31.520
that it's actually--

00:23:31.520 --> 00:23:35.030
you approach it as if it's
any other piece of food.

00:23:35.030 --> 00:23:37.920
You want to stabilize all your
variables first and foremost,

00:23:37.920 --> 00:23:40.580
and that's where this Direct
Trade model comes through.

00:23:40.580 --> 00:23:42.200
And I'm sure we'll
talk about it more,

00:23:42.200 --> 00:23:45.849
but just having that streamlined
communication between ourselves

00:23:45.849 --> 00:23:47.390
and the farmer to
actually understand

00:23:47.390 --> 00:23:50.060
what's going on in the
growing conditions,

00:23:50.060 --> 00:23:51.800
going on on the farm.

00:23:51.800 --> 00:23:55.340
I think that's key in
playing a fundamental role

00:23:55.340 --> 00:23:57.440
in a great roast.

00:23:57.440 --> 00:23:59.930
As far as the
actual roast, for us

00:23:59.930 --> 00:24:02.030
it goes anywhere from
10 to 15 minutes.

00:24:02.030 --> 00:24:06.995
We're stabilizing variables
as often as possible.

00:24:06.995 --> 00:24:09.707
There are some roasters,
some have a philosophy

00:24:09.707 --> 00:24:12.040
that you want to smell the
coffee as you're roasting it,

00:24:12.040 --> 00:24:15.280
you want to take
visual observations.

00:24:15.280 --> 00:24:17.950
For us, we found
that the roast goes

00:24:17.950 --> 00:24:21.730
so fast, it's really hard to
actually consistently say,

00:24:21.730 --> 00:24:26.680
that's the color, whatever we
want from an actual numbers

00:24:26.680 --> 00:24:28.360
perspective.

00:24:28.360 --> 00:24:30.190
Because the way we
will roast, is we'll

00:24:30.190 --> 00:24:33.760
roast our coffees to a
specific number on the Maillard

00:24:33.760 --> 00:24:34.540
reaction.

00:24:34.540 --> 00:24:37.750
So depending on
how brown it is, we

00:24:37.750 --> 00:24:40.990
are going to roast that
to say, 55 or a 60.

00:24:40.990 --> 00:24:45.460
And we have specific parameters
for each coffee that we want.

00:24:45.460 --> 00:24:50.170
As far as the overall big
picture view for roasting,

00:24:50.170 --> 00:24:51.879
we want a lot of
momentum on our coffees.

00:24:51.879 --> 00:24:53.294
We want to roast
them efficiently,

00:24:53.294 --> 00:24:54.700
and we want to roast them clean.

00:24:54.700 --> 00:24:57.010
If we run them too
slow, it's kind

00:24:57.010 --> 00:24:58.540
of like putting
an egg on a frying

00:24:58.540 --> 00:25:00.110
pan that hasn't
been preheated, it

00:25:00.110 --> 00:25:02.950
just kind of becomes kind of--

00:25:02.950 --> 00:25:04.660
you don't get that
sizzle, you know?

00:25:04.660 --> 00:25:09.376
It just kind of sits there, it's
flabby, you know you messed up.

00:25:09.376 --> 00:25:11.500
So for us, we want to make
sure with that momentum,

00:25:11.500 --> 00:25:14.260
we can push our coffees
as quickly as possible

00:25:14.260 --> 00:25:16.280
with continual
reduction and heat.

00:25:16.280 --> 00:25:17.642
I don't know if that's--

00:25:17.642 --> 00:25:18.475
JOHN PETRENKO: Yeah.

00:25:18.475 --> 00:25:18.970
MICHAEL SHERIDAN: Your
favorite to roast.

00:25:18.970 --> 00:25:21.030
SAM SABORI: That's about as
distilled as I can make it.

00:25:21.030 --> 00:25:21.480
[LAUGHTER]

00:25:21.480 --> 00:25:22.830
JOHN PETRENKO: All
right, definitely.

00:25:22.830 --> 00:25:23.920
And then favorite to roast?

00:25:23.920 --> 00:25:24.760
SAM SABORI: Favorite to roast?

00:25:24.760 --> 00:25:25.720
It'd probably be Kenya.

00:25:25.720 --> 00:25:26.470
That's probably why it's--

00:25:26.470 --> 00:25:27.303
JOHN PETRENKO: Yeah?

00:25:27.303 --> 00:25:29.320
Like a peaberry
or just kind of--

00:25:29.320 --> 00:25:30.940
SAM SABORI: Probably the AAs.

00:25:30.940 --> 00:25:35.050
So a Kenyan coffee,
they're classified

00:25:35.050 --> 00:25:37.990
based on their screen
size, so based on how big

00:25:37.990 --> 00:25:39.730
or small each bean is.

00:25:39.730 --> 00:25:45.280
And each grade as it goes
from AB to AA, AB or AA,

00:25:45.280 --> 00:25:50.020
or lower grades, they just
continue to get refined.

00:25:50.020 --> 00:25:55.630
So the AA, say that's one of
the better milling constructions

00:25:55.630 --> 00:25:58.180
that we can get, that
allows us to be a lot more

00:25:58.180 --> 00:26:00.670
direct with our approach.

00:26:00.670 --> 00:26:02.920
And it allows us to kind of
push the coffees further.

00:26:02.920 --> 00:26:06.130
Whereas if say we were
roasting a coffee that's

00:26:06.130 --> 00:26:09.390
borderline specialty,
say not from Kenya,

00:26:09.390 --> 00:26:11.140
we might have to adjust
our roast approach

00:26:11.140 --> 00:26:12.760
to slow down or speed up.

00:26:12.760 --> 00:26:14.950
Because if we roast
it at any other level,

00:26:14.950 --> 00:26:16.720
we're going to
get vegetal notes,

00:26:16.720 --> 00:26:20.302
we're going to get sour notes,
we're going to get astringency.

00:26:20.302 --> 00:26:22.510
So a lot of times when you're
tasting a coffee that's

00:26:22.510 --> 00:26:25.030
borderline specialty,
the roaster

00:26:25.030 --> 00:26:28.240
is making a decision to take it
that far because he's actually

00:26:28.240 --> 00:26:29.950
trying to minimize
the negatives.

00:26:29.950 --> 00:26:31.600
Whereas with a
Kenyan coffee, you

00:26:31.600 --> 00:26:34.540
can kind of keep
pushing them to continue

00:26:34.540 --> 00:26:36.216
to expand the complexity.

00:26:36.216 --> 00:26:37.050
JOHN PETRENKO: OK.

00:26:37.050 --> 00:26:38.784
Very cool.

00:26:38.784 --> 00:26:41.200
Another question is, since you
guys are founded in Chicago

00:26:41.200 --> 00:26:44.140
and we are in Google
Chicago, you guys

00:26:44.140 --> 00:26:45.850
operate in many
different cities.

00:26:45.850 --> 00:26:49.960
I'm wondering how you keep your
Chicago identity while you keep

00:26:49.960 --> 00:26:53.170
expanding into other markets?

00:26:53.170 --> 00:26:55.240
JAMES MCLAUGHLIN: Yeah,
that's a good question.

00:26:55.240 --> 00:26:57.200
You know, when we
go into new markets,

00:26:57.200 --> 00:27:01.300
we really try to become
part of the community.

00:27:01.300 --> 00:27:06.180
And LA was the first city
where we expanded into.

00:27:06.180 --> 00:27:08.560
And I think-- you know,
I've heard anecdotally

00:27:08.560 --> 00:27:10.390
that there's a lot
of people that think

00:27:10.390 --> 00:27:13.030
Intelligentsia is an LA brand.

00:27:13.030 --> 00:27:18.740
And that's really part of what
we want to do in each new city

00:27:18.740 --> 00:27:20.680
we go into.

00:27:20.680 --> 00:27:23.290
And I think there's
things, there's

00:27:23.290 --> 00:27:25.240
core things that
we try to keep true

00:27:25.240 --> 00:27:27.160
across all of our coffee bars.

00:27:27.160 --> 00:27:30.040
I mean, quality is obviously
the most important.

00:27:30.040 --> 00:27:32.650
Making sure that
the coffee always

00:27:32.650 --> 00:27:36.910
tastes the way we want
it to is fundamental.

00:27:36.910 --> 00:27:39.570
And it's probably
the hardest thing

00:27:39.570 --> 00:27:41.310
as we expand into new
cities, making sure

00:27:41.310 --> 00:27:43.590
that we have the team and
the people that can maintain

00:27:43.590 --> 00:27:46.020
our quality standards.

00:27:46.020 --> 00:27:48.360
But from a brand
perspective, it's

00:27:48.360 --> 00:27:50.890
very much, we want to become
part of the neighborhoods,

00:27:50.890 --> 00:27:53.490
we want to become part
of the communities.

00:27:53.490 --> 00:27:55.890
I think it's probably no
different than Google,

00:27:55.890 --> 00:27:58.650
you know, Google Chicago.

00:27:58.650 --> 00:28:00.150
And so we try to
find different ways

00:28:00.150 --> 00:28:03.300
to engage with the communities
when we go into new cities,

00:28:03.300 --> 00:28:06.150
and really become part of the
fabric of the neighborhood.

00:28:06.150 --> 00:28:07.650
JOHN PETRENKO: All
right, very cool.

00:28:07.650 --> 00:28:10.354
What's your favorite
Chicago Intelligentsia?

00:28:10.354 --> 00:28:12.520
JAMES MCLAUGHLIN: Definitely
the Monadnock location.

00:28:12.520 --> 00:28:13.710
JOHN PETRENKO: Oh, OK.

00:28:13.710 --> 00:28:16.690
JAMES MCLAUGHLIN: Just the
old school, it's in the--

00:28:16.690 --> 00:28:20.340
that building was at one point
the world's tallest building.

00:28:20.340 --> 00:28:23.680
It's a completely
brick structure.

00:28:23.680 --> 00:28:24.600
So it's not very tall.

00:28:24.600 --> 00:28:26.250
[LAUGHTER]

00:28:26.250 --> 00:28:29.640
But I think that's a great
example of some of the design

00:28:29.640 --> 00:28:31.000
choices we make.

00:28:31.000 --> 00:28:34.260
You know, if you go into there,
it's all marble countertops,

00:28:34.260 --> 00:28:38.490
there's a brass bar, it
feels old, modern but old.

00:28:38.490 --> 00:28:40.770
And it's sort of supposed
to reflect that building

00:28:40.770 --> 00:28:42.000
and that architecture.

00:28:42.000 --> 00:28:43.608
So that would be
my favorite one.

00:28:43.608 --> 00:28:45.240
JOHN PETRENKO: All right.

00:28:45.240 --> 00:28:45.810
Anybody else?

00:28:49.170 --> 00:28:50.580
SAM SABORI: Favorite cafe?

00:28:50.580 --> 00:28:53.010
I'd probably say Wicker because
it's closest to my house.

00:28:53.010 --> 00:28:54.440
[LAUGHTER]

00:28:54.440 --> 00:28:56.341
JOHN PETRENKO: That's a fun one.

00:28:56.341 --> 00:28:58.340
MICHAEL SHERIDAN: Yeah,
Wicker's on my route in.

00:28:58.340 --> 00:28:59.320
JOHN PETRENKO: Wicker?

00:28:59.320 --> 00:28:59.990
All right, very cool.

00:28:59.990 --> 00:29:01.560
MICHAEL SHERIDAN: It's the
off-site conference room.

00:29:01.560 --> 00:29:03.310
JOHN PETRENKO: Yeah,
no, that's a fun one.

00:29:03.310 --> 00:29:04.200
I love that one.

00:29:04.200 --> 00:29:06.990
So one thing is like, with
climate change affecting

00:29:06.990 --> 00:29:10.450
crop production and farming
all across the world,

00:29:10.450 --> 00:29:12.780
how do you see coffee being
affected by this crisis?

00:29:12.780 --> 00:29:14.550
And how do you see
coffee going forward

00:29:14.550 --> 00:29:15.883
if these trends aren't reversed?

00:29:19.302 --> 00:29:20.260
MICHAEL SHERIDAN: Yeah.

00:29:20.260 --> 00:29:27.980
So climate change is a big deal
in every aspect of our lives,

00:29:27.980 --> 00:29:30.420
and coffee is no exception.

00:29:30.420 --> 00:29:31.550
Climate change is--

00:29:33.941 --> 00:29:35.940
I've heard coffee described,
I think accurately,

00:29:35.940 --> 00:29:37.650
as a Goldilocks crop.

00:29:37.650 --> 00:29:39.210
Can't be too hot,
it can be too cold.

00:29:39.210 --> 00:29:40.140
It has to be just right.

00:29:40.140 --> 00:29:42.515
It can't have too much rain,
it can have too little rain.

00:29:42.515 --> 00:29:44.400
It has to have just the
right amount of rain.

00:29:44.400 --> 00:29:47.420
Arabica coffee, which
is what we source,

00:29:47.420 --> 00:29:51.120
the specialty coffee is
almost entirely Arabica.

00:29:51.120 --> 00:29:53.490
It's a very finicky crop.

00:29:53.490 --> 00:29:56.850
And it grows in the tropics
at a certain elevation range,

00:29:56.850 --> 00:29:59.730
and has these requirements
for temperature and rain.

00:29:59.730 --> 00:30:03.636
And those are getting
changed with climate change.

00:30:03.636 --> 00:30:05.760
And I think there's been
a lot of research on this,

00:30:05.760 --> 00:30:10.320
and general tendency
that people see in coffee

00:30:10.320 --> 00:30:13.410
is that the optimal elevation
for coffee, the elevation

00:30:13.410 --> 00:30:15.810
range for coffee is rising
as temperatures rise.

00:30:15.810 --> 00:30:17.717
So coffee likes the cool.

00:30:17.717 --> 00:30:19.800
One of the things we look
at when we source coffee

00:30:19.800 --> 00:30:22.710
is the diurnal temperature
range, so the difference

00:30:22.710 --> 00:30:26.169
between the high in the
midday and the low at night.

00:30:26.169 --> 00:30:27.960
And the cool temperatures
stress the plant,

00:30:27.960 --> 00:30:29.670
and they contribute
to the creation

00:30:29.670 --> 00:30:31.940
of these beautiful
complex flavors.

00:30:31.940 --> 00:30:34.080
And that cool, to get
that kind of cool,

00:30:34.080 --> 00:30:35.500
you have to go
higher and higher.

00:30:35.500 --> 00:30:36.990
And we know because of
the nature of mountains,

00:30:36.990 --> 00:30:38.910
the higher you go, the
less land is available.

00:30:38.910 --> 00:30:43.620
So coffee lands are going away
under a kind of a business

00:30:43.620 --> 00:30:45.765
as usual scenario.

00:30:45.765 --> 00:30:47.640
And there's very little
that a grower can do.

00:30:47.640 --> 00:30:50.670
Growers can mitigate the effects
of that and sort of forestall

00:30:50.670 --> 00:30:53.310
that through their management
practices by managing shade

00:30:53.310 --> 00:30:55.680
more intensively, lowering
the ambient temperature

00:30:55.680 --> 00:30:57.150
of their coffee groves.

00:30:57.150 --> 00:30:58.560
But ultimately,
they're not going

00:30:58.560 --> 00:31:00.184
to be able to make
the kinds of changes

00:31:00.184 --> 00:31:02.830
on the farm to keep up
with climate change.

00:31:02.830 --> 00:31:06.000
So one of the very
important short term things

00:31:06.000 --> 00:31:08.340
is working with
growers to implement

00:31:08.340 --> 00:31:10.410
some of those things that
will help to optimize

00:31:10.410 --> 00:31:12.490
the quality of their coffee.

00:31:12.490 --> 00:31:16.000
But the long term, we
require more research.

00:31:16.000 --> 00:31:19.380
So all the staple
crops that we consume,

00:31:19.380 --> 00:31:21.780
rice, and corn,
and wheat, they all

00:31:21.780 --> 00:31:23.650
have publicly funded
research institutes.

00:31:23.650 --> 00:31:26.700
But coffee as a
cash crop does not.

00:31:26.700 --> 00:31:28.890
And so the industry has
been working together

00:31:28.890 --> 00:31:30.570
over the last 5 to
10 years to create

00:31:30.570 --> 00:31:33.660
a collective research--
an industry driven

00:31:33.660 --> 00:31:35.700
research agency.

00:31:35.700 --> 00:31:40.140
They're looking for sort
of the holy grail, which

00:31:40.140 --> 00:31:46.910
is a combination of varieties
that resist drought and disease

00:31:46.910 --> 00:31:48.900
and they produce a
beautiful flavor in the cup.

00:31:48.900 --> 00:31:52.140
Generally plant breeders are
just focused on productivity,

00:31:52.140 --> 00:31:55.460
they want to maximize yield and
they don't think about flavor.

00:31:55.460 --> 00:31:57.000
There's an
organization that we've

00:31:57.000 --> 00:31:58.560
been supporting
since its inception,

00:31:58.560 --> 00:32:00.390
since it was just in
the concept phase,

00:32:00.390 --> 00:32:02.400
it's called World
Coffee Research.

00:32:02.400 --> 00:32:05.400
And this is their
pursuit, to make

00:32:05.400 --> 00:32:08.250
specialty coffee viable in
an era of accelerated climate

00:32:08.250 --> 00:32:09.210
change.

00:32:09.210 --> 00:32:12.030
And they're doing-- they've done
more in the last 5 to 10 years

00:32:12.030 --> 00:32:13.764
on plant breeding
through partnerships

00:32:13.764 --> 00:32:15.180
with the local
research institutes

00:32:15.180 --> 00:32:16.800
throughout the
coffee growing world

00:32:16.800 --> 00:32:18.892
than has been done in
the history of specialty

00:32:18.892 --> 00:32:19.600
leading up to it.

00:32:19.600 --> 00:32:23.730
And we contribute, we consider
it part of our cost of goods.

00:32:23.730 --> 00:32:27.630
We contribute a half a penny per
pound for every pound of coffee

00:32:27.630 --> 00:32:30.180
that we buy to
this research fund.

00:32:30.180 --> 00:32:33.650
James sits on the board as
another part of our belief in

00:32:33.650 --> 00:32:35.675
and commitment to this effort.

00:32:35.675 --> 00:32:37.291
And it's fundamental.

00:32:37.291 --> 00:32:38.790
But it's definitely
changing things,

00:32:38.790 --> 00:32:41.700
and it is changing the
patterns of disease,

00:32:41.700 --> 00:32:43.980
changing cup profile.

00:32:43.980 --> 00:32:45.780
And it's changing so fast that--

00:32:45.780 --> 00:32:48.746
we're so deeply engaged
with our partners

00:32:48.746 --> 00:32:50.370
on the coffees that
come in every year,

00:32:50.370 --> 00:32:52.759
and we're cupping them
throughout their life span.

00:32:52.759 --> 00:32:54.300
And so we're working
to give feedback

00:32:54.300 --> 00:32:57.990
and trying to see what the
changes are in the cup.

00:32:57.990 --> 00:33:01.140
We're continuing to
source amazing coffees,

00:33:01.140 --> 00:33:02.880
but it's something
that everybody

00:33:02.880 --> 00:33:06.150
in every aspect, every step in
the supply chain is working on.

00:33:06.150 --> 00:33:08.580
So we're funding research,
we're working at the farm level

00:33:08.580 --> 00:33:09.246
to deal with it.

00:33:09.246 --> 00:33:11.820
We're trying to promote
water saving technologies.

00:33:11.820 --> 00:33:14.100
But it's a challenge
in coffee as it

00:33:14.100 --> 00:33:17.797
is in all of agriculture and
every human endeavor really.

00:33:17.797 --> 00:33:18.630
JOHN PETRENKO: Yeah.

00:33:18.630 --> 00:33:19.588
JAMES MCLAUGHLIN: Yeah.

00:33:19.588 --> 00:33:22.110
I mean, just two
specific examples.

00:33:22.110 --> 00:33:26.550
Where I was living in
Brazil, that region just

00:33:26.550 --> 00:33:29.230
came out of the worst drought.

00:33:29.230 --> 00:33:31.470
They were in a two year drought.

00:33:31.470 --> 00:33:35.580
And many, many producers
in the region where I was

00:33:35.580 --> 00:33:39.420
have abandoned their farms,
because the coffee trees died.

00:33:39.420 --> 00:33:42.990
And given that most
of these producers

00:33:42.990 --> 00:33:44.760
aren't focused on
quality, there's

00:33:44.760 --> 00:33:46.800
really no future for them.

00:33:46.800 --> 00:33:51.080
So given that it is
mostly a smallholder crop,

00:33:51.080 --> 00:33:55.020
it's a huge risk to the
industry as a whole.

00:33:55.020 --> 00:33:57.050
The other example was,
as Michael mentioned,

00:33:57.050 --> 00:34:00.530
the other problem with
climate change is disease.

00:34:00.530 --> 00:34:04.107
Five years ago, four years
ago, Central America--

00:34:04.107 --> 00:34:05.690
all the countries
in Central America--

00:34:05.690 --> 00:34:09.949
had an outbreak of a disease
called leaf rust, and really

00:34:09.949 --> 00:34:14.270
devastated Guatemala,
Honduras, El Salvador,

00:34:14.270 --> 00:34:16.820
and wiped out many, many farms.

00:34:16.820 --> 00:34:19.580
And it's really a product
of higher temperatures

00:34:19.580 --> 00:34:25.040
allows this fungus to
breed more rapidly.

00:34:25.040 --> 00:34:28.070
And as Michael mentioned,
the future really

00:34:28.070 --> 00:34:30.800
is in plant breeding
and figuring out

00:34:30.800 --> 00:34:32.690
how to create the
super plant that

00:34:32.690 --> 00:34:37.100
can produce higher quality,
resist disease, resist higher

00:34:37.100 --> 00:34:38.330
temperatures.

00:34:38.330 --> 00:34:41.750
But frankly, as an industry,
we're pretty far behind

00:34:41.750 --> 00:34:43.489
in terms of that research.

00:34:43.489 --> 00:34:46.679
And we're-- there's a lot of
pressure to catch up quickly.

00:34:46.679 --> 00:34:48.179
JOHN PETRENKO: I
think we don't need

00:34:48.179 --> 00:34:50.575
argue that technology
and the internet

00:34:50.575 --> 00:34:52.699
has been pretty disruptive
in the past two decades.

00:34:52.699 --> 00:34:55.749
How has it changed
for your business?

00:34:55.749 --> 00:34:57.540
That and like, social
media and everything.

00:34:57.540 --> 00:34:58.498
JAMES MCLAUGHLIN: Yeah.

00:34:58.498 --> 00:34:59.347
JOHN PETRENKO: Yeah.

00:34:59.347 --> 00:35:00.930
JAMES MCLAUGHLIN:
So I'm going to take

00:35:00.930 --> 00:35:02.060
this in a couple
different directions.

00:35:02.060 --> 00:35:02.570
JOHN PETRENKO: Great.

00:35:02.570 --> 00:35:04.840
JAMES MCLAUGHLIN: The first
I think is, in some ways,

00:35:04.840 --> 00:35:07.900
I think coffee
hasn't changed much.

00:35:07.900 --> 00:35:10.680
I mean, if you look at the
roasters that we use today,

00:35:10.680 --> 00:35:14.459
they're the same roasters that
we've used 80, 90 years ago.

00:35:14.459 --> 00:35:16.000
There's some upgrades
here and there.

00:35:16.000 --> 00:35:18.900
But overall, it's like you
apply heat to this metal drum,

00:35:18.900 --> 00:35:22.200
you put green coffee
in, and it turns brown.

00:35:22.200 --> 00:35:24.810
So in some ways, I
think there's frankly

00:35:24.810 --> 00:35:27.810
a huge opportunity
for the industry

00:35:27.810 --> 00:35:29.280
to kind of catch
up and figure out,

00:35:29.280 --> 00:35:31.170
are there other ways
to make coffee--

00:35:31.170 --> 00:35:33.150
to turn coffee brown?

00:35:33.150 --> 00:35:35.940
So that's point number one.

00:35:35.940 --> 00:35:38.080
There's pretty cool stuff
that's happening though,

00:35:38.080 --> 00:35:41.790
in terms of the
ability to produce

00:35:41.790 --> 00:35:45.780
great tasting cups of coffee
where it doesn't require

00:35:45.780 --> 00:35:47.526
a lot of manual work.

00:35:47.526 --> 00:35:49.650
I mean, one of the things
that we always talk about

00:35:49.650 --> 00:35:52.380
is, when you think about all
the different people that touch

00:35:52.380 --> 00:35:55.830
coffee in the supply chain;
from the producer, their choices

00:35:55.830 --> 00:35:57.750
in the varietal;
the picker, they

00:35:57.750 --> 00:36:00.450
choose which cherries they're
going to put in the bill--

00:36:00.450 --> 00:36:04.260
in the bag; the
miller, the wet mill,

00:36:04.260 --> 00:36:08.712
the dry mill; the roaster;
the barista; the end user.

00:36:08.712 --> 00:36:10.170
I mean, there's so
many people that

00:36:10.170 --> 00:36:13.830
can affect how a cup
of coffee tastes.

00:36:13.830 --> 00:36:15.670
And we really--

00:36:15.670 --> 00:36:18.810
I think where we are going
to go as an industry, where

00:36:18.810 --> 00:36:21.000
this industry is
going is, that's

00:36:21.000 --> 00:36:22.454
going to get whittled down.

00:36:22.454 --> 00:36:24.870
Frankly we have too many people
that can affect the flavor

00:36:24.870 --> 00:36:26.575
and not really optimize it.

00:36:26.575 --> 00:36:28.950
And I think what we're going
to see over the next 5 or 10

00:36:28.950 --> 00:36:32.760
years is, the number
of people that--

00:36:32.760 --> 00:36:35.910
we're going to get coffee
into consumers' hands

00:36:35.910 --> 00:36:39.090
in a finished good
kind of way that

00:36:39.090 --> 00:36:42.450
actually tastes
amazing in a better way

00:36:42.450 --> 00:36:43.470
than we do currently.

00:36:43.470 --> 00:36:45.420
Selling a consumer
a bag of coffee

00:36:45.420 --> 00:36:46.620
is always terrifying for us.

00:36:46.620 --> 00:36:51.900
Because they take it home,
they put it in their grinder,

00:36:51.900 --> 00:36:56.759
they add too much water, they
don't do 18.25 to 1 ratio.

00:36:56.759 --> 00:36:58.800
And then they look at the
bag and they say, gosh,

00:36:58.800 --> 00:37:00.845
why does Intelligentsia
coffee not taste great?

00:37:00.845 --> 00:37:02.220
And it's like,
no, but you didn't

00:37:02.220 --> 00:37:04.960
do all these different things.

00:37:04.960 --> 00:37:08.580
So I think there's-- from
a technology standpoint,

00:37:08.580 --> 00:37:10.170
I think there's
more from a brewing,

00:37:10.170 --> 00:37:13.990
roasting perspective that
is starting to happen,

00:37:13.990 --> 00:37:18.360
but hasn't really happened--
hasn't caught up yet.

00:37:18.360 --> 00:37:20.337
I was in Brazil--

00:37:20.337 --> 00:37:22.420
I still buy coffee for
Brazil for Intelligentsia--

00:37:22.420 --> 00:37:26.070
and I was on this farm, and
they actually grow grapes there.

00:37:26.070 --> 00:37:30.060
And they have a-- they're
starting a winery.

00:37:30.060 --> 00:37:33.510
And so we took a day's
picking of coffee

00:37:33.510 --> 00:37:37.170
and we took it to the winery and
we used the winery's equipment

00:37:37.170 --> 00:37:38.880
to process the coffee.

00:37:38.880 --> 00:37:43.020
Like super precise,
super detailed.

00:37:43.020 --> 00:37:46.410
We had this trained
professional, wine professional

00:37:46.410 --> 00:37:48.480
there consulting with us.

00:37:48.480 --> 00:37:50.790
And you don't see
that in coffee today,

00:37:50.790 --> 00:37:53.970
it's still pretty random
and haphazard on the farm.

00:37:53.970 --> 00:37:56.310
So I think there's
a lot of opportunity

00:37:56.310 --> 00:38:01.260
in terms of being more precise
throughout the whole supply

00:38:01.260 --> 00:38:01.960
chain.

00:38:01.960 --> 00:38:04.990
I think to get to
your second question,

00:38:04.990 --> 00:38:07.380
the great thing about social
media and the internet

00:38:07.380 --> 00:38:11.160
is that it's given
voices to smaller brands

00:38:11.160 --> 00:38:12.930
like Intelligentsia,
where we can actually

00:38:12.930 --> 00:38:18.450
reach more people in a way that
we couldn't have 20 years ago.

00:38:18.450 --> 00:38:21.750
And education is one of
the most important things

00:38:21.750 --> 00:38:22.740
for a company like us.

00:38:22.740 --> 00:38:26.310
Why do you pay $22 for
a bag of Tikur Anbessa

00:38:26.310 --> 00:38:29.730
from Ethiopia when
there's a bag of Starbucks

00:38:29.730 --> 00:38:31.990
at the grocery store for $7?

00:38:31.990 --> 00:38:33.960
So what is different
about Intelligentsia

00:38:33.960 --> 00:38:37.430
from Starbucks, it's both
brown beans in a bag?

00:38:37.430 --> 00:38:40.830
And it really gives us a
chance to educate consumers

00:38:40.830 --> 00:38:43.560
about all the things we've
been talking about today.

00:38:43.560 --> 00:38:45.420
That, and then also
educate consumers

00:38:45.420 --> 00:38:48.180
about how to brew the cup
of coffee so it tastes good.

00:38:48.180 --> 00:38:50.220
JOHN PETRENKO:
Definitely, definitely.

00:38:50.220 --> 00:38:54.177
One kind of fanboy
question I have is,

00:38:54.177 --> 00:38:55.260
you guys go out to origin.

00:38:55.260 --> 00:38:57.450
It's something I've always
really dreamed of doing,

00:38:57.450 --> 00:38:59.320
I think it would be amazing.

00:38:59.320 --> 00:39:02.040
I'm curious, what are your
favorite trips of origin

00:39:02.040 --> 00:39:05.010
to go to, and maybe like
a fun crazy story that

00:39:05.010 --> 00:39:06.440
has happened while at origin?

00:39:06.440 --> 00:39:07.370
That's for all three of you.

00:39:07.370 --> 00:39:09.036
SAM SABORI: I think
you've got this one.

00:39:09.036 --> 00:39:10.545
[LAUGHTER]

00:39:11.179 --> 00:39:13.804
MICHAEL SHERIDAN: I think I know
the story you want me to tell.

00:39:13.804 --> 00:39:14.770
[LAUGHTER]

00:39:14.770 --> 00:39:17.430
It's not always fun stuff
that happens at origin.

00:39:17.430 --> 00:39:21.330
Sometimes crazy stuff happens
that's not entirely fun.

00:39:21.330 --> 00:39:22.620
Well I think it's--

00:39:22.620 --> 00:39:26.710
certainly it's like, there's
kind of this thing in coffee,

00:39:26.710 --> 00:39:28.920
and not everybody falls
into the same pattern.

00:39:28.920 --> 00:39:33.490
But the principle entry point
for coffee is as a barista.

00:39:33.490 --> 00:39:36.690
Like you just heard Sam's
experience, it's pretty common.

00:39:36.690 --> 00:39:38.792
People when they--
they're a barista,

00:39:38.792 --> 00:39:41.250
and if it's just that they want
benefits and pay for school

00:39:41.250 --> 00:39:42.160
and they're out, there out.

00:39:42.160 --> 00:39:43.320
But a lot of people
catch the bug

00:39:43.320 --> 00:39:45.750
and they get totally passionate
about this thing that's

00:39:45.750 --> 00:39:47.940
endlessly complex and
really fascinating, way

00:39:47.940 --> 00:39:50.481
more interesting than they ever
thought it was when they were

00:39:50.481 --> 00:39:51.936
just trying to pay some bills.

00:39:51.936 --> 00:39:53.310
And they go down
the rabbit hole.

00:39:53.310 --> 00:39:55.320
And generally, the
more people get

00:39:55.320 --> 00:39:57.890
interested in coffee, the more
they get interested in where

00:39:57.890 --> 00:39:59.640
it comes from, and the
people who grow it,

00:39:59.640 --> 00:40:00.931
and they want to get to origin.

00:40:00.931 --> 00:40:03.840
And so there's something kind
of mythical about getting

00:40:03.840 --> 00:40:05.340
to take your first origin trip.

00:40:05.340 --> 00:40:08.550
It's sort of like a milestone
in the professional development

00:40:08.550 --> 00:40:10.770
of serious coffee people.

00:40:10.770 --> 00:40:13.900
And so there's no question,
it's the highlight of the job.

00:40:13.900 --> 00:40:16.650
All three of us here
buy coffee in addition

00:40:16.650 --> 00:40:18.412
to the work we do
at the roasting

00:40:18.412 --> 00:40:19.870
works a couple of
blocks from here.

00:40:19.870 --> 00:40:22.810
So the trips are things
we look forward to.

00:40:22.810 --> 00:40:25.170
And we take at least one a
year, sometimes more than one

00:40:25.170 --> 00:40:27.600
when we have a special
project going on.

00:40:27.600 --> 00:40:29.190
And we look forward to it.

00:40:29.190 --> 00:40:32.640
And it's a time when
you cut through all

00:40:32.640 --> 00:40:35.250
the emails and the phone calls,
and you just sit on the farm.

00:40:35.250 --> 00:40:38.580
And there just something magical
about being on a coffee farm.

00:40:38.580 --> 00:40:41.430
I particularly love
shade grown coffee,

00:40:41.430 --> 00:40:43.200
where you're outside
in the tropical sun

00:40:43.200 --> 00:40:46.140
and it's hot, maybe 70 degrees,
but a really strong sun.

00:40:46.140 --> 00:40:48.060
And you step into
the coffee grove

00:40:48.060 --> 00:40:50.550
and the temperature drops like
12 degrees, and it's cool,

00:40:50.550 --> 00:40:53.070
and you feel the moisture,
and you understand what

00:40:53.070 --> 00:40:55.170
the shade does for the coffee.

00:40:55.170 --> 00:40:58.955
And then you're doing it
together with a grower,

00:40:58.955 --> 00:40:59.580
and it's great.

00:40:59.580 --> 00:41:01.590
And there's a lot of
planning that goes into it.

00:41:01.590 --> 00:41:02.670
You talk about, hey,
here's what we'd

00:41:02.670 --> 00:41:03.630
like to do together this year.

00:41:03.630 --> 00:41:05.970
Last year we bought this much,
we'd like to buy a little more,

00:41:05.970 --> 00:41:07.140
we'd like to buy a
little less, we'd

00:41:07.140 --> 00:41:09.250
like it to be more like
this, or less like that.

00:41:09.250 --> 00:41:11.640
So you do all this
planning and then you go

00:41:11.640 --> 00:41:14.190
and you're on the farm
together, you're at the mill

00:41:14.190 --> 00:41:17.592
together putting
in place the plan.

00:41:17.592 --> 00:41:19.050
What they want me
to talk about is,

00:41:19.050 --> 00:41:20.330
last year we did
all this planning.

00:41:20.330 --> 00:41:20.830
[LAUGHTER]

00:41:20.830 --> 00:41:23.924
I made my first trip as the
new coffee buyer in Bolivia.

00:41:23.924 --> 00:41:25.590
We have this really
exciting farm there.

00:41:25.590 --> 00:41:27.360
We're going to have
coffee from this farm

00:41:27.360 --> 00:41:29.070
in just a couple of weeks.

00:41:29.070 --> 00:41:31.290
It's called Finca
Takesi and it lays

00:41:31.290 --> 00:41:34.000
the claim to being the highest
coffee farm in the world.

00:41:34.000 --> 00:41:36.787
And we've been buying coffee,
we bought coffee in 20 countries

00:41:36.787 --> 00:41:38.370
over the last 23
years and we've never

00:41:38.370 --> 00:41:39.570
found a higher coffee farm.

00:41:39.570 --> 00:41:44.247
So we have no evidence to
suggest the claim is untrue.

00:41:44.247 --> 00:41:46.080
So for me, I was going
to the highest coffee

00:41:46.080 --> 00:41:47.746
farm in the world, I
was really excited,

00:41:47.746 --> 00:41:49.350
my first trip to Bolivia.

00:41:49.350 --> 00:41:52.090
Bolivia's kind of a bit
of a backwater country

00:41:52.090 --> 00:41:53.721
as far as anything goes.

00:41:53.721 --> 00:41:55.470
It's landlocked, it's
very hard to get to,

00:41:55.470 --> 00:41:58.320
all the flights
arrive at 3:00 AM.

00:41:58.320 --> 00:42:00.390
I wanted to save the
company a couple of nickels,

00:42:00.390 --> 00:42:02.520
and I had a complicated
itinerary that

00:42:02.520 --> 00:42:04.450
had two stops instead of one.

00:42:04.450 --> 00:42:06.570
And I went to the first
stop on the first day

00:42:06.570 --> 00:42:08.570
and I missed my connection,
I had to wait a day,

00:42:08.570 --> 00:42:09.944
so I spent a night in Guatemala.

00:42:09.944 --> 00:42:11.610
And then I went the
next day to Colombia

00:42:11.610 --> 00:42:12.505
and I missed my
connection there,

00:42:12.505 --> 00:42:13.515
so I had to spend a
night in Colombia.

00:42:13.515 --> 00:42:15.540
So on the third day
after leaving Chicago,

00:42:15.540 --> 00:42:18.770
I pull in at 3:00 AM
to La Paz in Bolivia.

00:42:18.770 --> 00:42:21.120
And my partner picks us up
and we head out to the field,

00:42:21.120 --> 00:42:23.130
and we're about 10
minutes from the farm,

00:42:23.130 --> 00:42:27.060
and in the Bolivian Andes,
these commanding Bolivian Andes.

00:42:27.060 --> 00:42:29.925
And the car flipped and
rolled over once, twice,

00:42:29.925 --> 00:42:32.010
three, five or six times.

00:42:32.010 --> 00:42:33.900
And we dropped about
100 meters down the side

00:42:33.900 --> 00:42:36.110
of one of these big mountains.

00:42:36.110 --> 00:42:40.170
And by some sort of miracle,
we both emerged unscathed.

00:42:40.170 --> 00:42:42.000
But I had had enough.

00:42:42.000 --> 00:42:43.530
I was mentally a
little bit taxed,

00:42:43.530 --> 00:42:44.904
so I got on the
next flight home.

00:42:44.904 --> 00:42:47.430
So I spent five days
on a sourcing trip,

00:42:47.430 --> 00:42:49.320
and I spent about 13
minutes on a farm,

00:42:49.320 --> 00:42:52.050
and then I was evacuated to
go to a hospital [INAUDIBLE]..

00:42:52.050 --> 00:42:53.670
All that hard
planning, it doesn't--

00:42:53.670 --> 00:42:56.160
careful planning doesn't
always lead to success.

00:42:56.160 --> 00:42:59.370
But I was just there
last month, no incidents.

00:42:59.370 --> 00:43:01.680
The coffee is beautiful
and delicious.

00:43:01.680 --> 00:43:05.132
One of the things we
do at our ECW event,

00:43:05.132 --> 00:43:07.590
is the last two years we've
had a coffee competition, which

00:43:07.590 --> 00:43:08.256
is just awesome.

00:43:08.256 --> 00:43:11.880
So think about the all-star team
of coffee, everybody bringing

00:43:11.880 --> 00:43:14.970
the best two kilos of coffee
they can produce to the table.

00:43:14.970 --> 00:43:17.640
Sam roasts it, we all
cup it, we qualify it,

00:43:17.640 --> 00:43:19.830
and then the growers
themselves vote.

00:43:19.830 --> 00:43:22.360
We have awards that are voted
on by everybody in the supply

00:43:22.360 --> 00:43:22.860
chain.

00:43:22.860 --> 00:43:24.526
So they're tasting
each other's coffees,

00:43:24.526 --> 00:43:26.990
they're looking around the
room, they're all blindly coded.

00:43:26.990 --> 00:43:29.040
So people are going, is
this mine, is that hers,

00:43:29.040 --> 00:43:30.630
is it his, whose is it?

00:43:30.630 --> 00:43:31.970
And then we reveal the coffees.

00:43:31.970 --> 00:43:35.700
So this coffee from this farm
was voted the best coffee

00:43:35.700 --> 00:43:38.720
in the southern hemisphere,
best coffee in South America,

00:43:38.720 --> 00:43:41.160
and we've got two bags of this
coffee that are coming in,

00:43:41.160 --> 00:43:43.800
two 60 kilo bags that are coming
in in a couple of weeks' time.

00:43:43.800 --> 00:43:45.400
So we'll make a
big deal about it

00:43:45.400 --> 00:43:47.400
when it arrives, and it's
going to be delicious.

00:43:47.400 --> 00:43:49.899
So in the end, it will
all have been worth it.

00:43:49.899 --> 00:43:50.940
JOHN PETRENKO: Very cool.

00:43:50.940 --> 00:43:51.440
[LAUGHTER]

00:43:51.440 --> 00:43:54.090
Well, I think we
are about time for--

00:43:54.090 --> 00:43:56.790
to open up to a
Q&amp;A. So if anybody

00:43:56.790 --> 00:43:58.590
wants to ask a
question, we'll have

00:43:58.590 --> 00:44:01.560
a microphone running around.

00:44:01.560 --> 00:44:03.600
AUDIENCE: So you
mentioned the three waves.

00:44:03.600 --> 00:44:06.550
What do you think is wave
number four if it comes?

00:44:06.550 --> 00:44:09.780
And what's the future of
both coffee production,

00:44:09.780 --> 00:44:12.266
to your earlier question,
and coffee consumption?

00:44:16.550 --> 00:44:20.120
JAMES MCLAUGHLIN: Well I'll
start and you guys can jump in.

00:44:20.120 --> 00:44:22.150
I think we're going
to continue to see--

00:44:22.150 --> 00:44:23.150
on the production side--

00:44:23.150 --> 00:44:26.630
I think we're going to continue
to see a segregation of farms.

00:44:29.360 --> 00:44:32.030
On the commodity side,
what you're seeing across

00:44:32.030 --> 00:44:37.250
the world is this move to
massive, massive farms,

00:44:37.250 --> 00:44:41.690
primarily in Brazil
and Vietnam where

00:44:41.690 --> 00:44:45.680
all of the work on the farm
is being done mechanically.

00:44:45.680 --> 00:44:49.340
And so that, I think,
will continue to grow.

00:44:49.340 --> 00:44:52.070
Those farms are
becoming so efficient

00:44:52.070 --> 00:44:54.770
that they can make
money even when

00:44:54.770 --> 00:44:57.260
the commodity market is at $1.

00:44:57.260 --> 00:45:01.280
Most farms-- I don't
know if you have a stat,

00:45:01.280 --> 00:45:02.570
for some reason I want--

00:45:02.570 --> 00:45:02.800
I think it's like--

00:45:02.800 --> 00:45:03.300
MICHAEL SHERIDAN: $1.40, $1.50.

00:45:03.300 --> 00:45:05.716
JAMES MCLAUGHLIN: Yeah. $1.40,
$1.50 is kind of break even

00:45:05.716 --> 00:45:07.010
for most farmers.

00:45:07.010 --> 00:45:08.990
And so I think you're
going to continue

00:45:08.990 --> 00:45:14.990
to see that agribusiness
grow for the commodity side.

00:45:14.990 --> 00:45:17.370
On the specialty side--

00:45:17.370 --> 00:45:22.870
and so that model is
not sustainable for most

00:45:22.870 --> 00:45:24.342
smallholders.

00:45:24.342 --> 00:45:26.050
The smallholder is
never going to compete

00:45:26.050 --> 00:45:27.640
with the massive
farm in Brazil that

00:45:27.640 --> 00:45:29.740
has huge tractors,
and everything else,

00:45:29.740 --> 00:45:31.700
and all this money behind it.

00:45:31.700 --> 00:45:35.380
So the only hope, in my
opinion, for the smallholder

00:45:35.380 --> 00:45:39.370
is to focus on quality and
go the route of specialty.

00:45:39.370 --> 00:45:41.860
That requires an investment,
it requires time, it's

00:45:41.860 --> 00:45:44.711
not something that you
just turn on overnight.

00:45:44.711 --> 00:45:46.960
But I don't think there's
going to be a middle ground.

00:45:46.960 --> 00:45:49.090
Either you're doing
specialty coffee,

00:45:49.090 --> 00:45:50.950
or you're in the
commodity world.

00:45:50.950 --> 00:45:53.350
I just don't see a future
for the smallholder trying

00:45:53.350 --> 00:45:56.990
to produce commodity coffee.

00:45:56.990 --> 00:46:01.960
I kind of alluded to
this earlier, I believe--

00:46:01.960 --> 00:46:03.970
there's so much more
complexity in coffee

00:46:03.970 --> 00:46:05.980
than we currently understand.

00:46:05.980 --> 00:46:09.320
There's varietals,
there's processing method,

00:46:09.320 --> 00:46:12.160
there's the stuff that
Sam does with the roaster.

00:46:12.160 --> 00:46:17.500
And the average consumer
still doesn't get it.

00:46:17.500 --> 00:46:21.332
There's so much more for us
to unlock for the consumer.

00:46:21.332 --> 00:46:23.290
And it's something that
we talk a lot about, is

00:46:23.290 --> 00:46:26.050
how do we communicate
the complexity of coffee,

00:46:26.050 --> 00:46:27.790
and how do we do
it in a way that

00:46:27.790 --> 00:46:31.270
doesn't overwhelm the consumer?

00:46:31.270 --> 00:46:33.520
And I don't know that we've
totally figured it out.

00:46:33.520 --> 00:46:37.210
We're trying, but I think
over the next 5 to 10 years,

00:46:37.210 --> 00:46:39.730
coffee is going to continue
to go the route of wine,

00:46:39.730 --> 00:46:43.510
where consumers
start to say, wow, I

00:46:43.510 --> 00:46:47.620
really like the Catuai variety
processed in a washed method,

00:46:47.620 --> 00:46:51.327
or a pulp natural method,
and I really like Costa Rica.

00:46:51.327 --> 00:46:53.410
One of the things-- one
of the concepts that we've

00:46:53.410 --> 00:46:56.455
introduced at Intelligentsia
is this idea of seasonality.

00:46:56.455 --> 00:46:58.330
And so if you go into
one of our coffee bars,

00:46:58.330 --> 00:47:02.140
you'll see a sticker that says,
some bags say it's in season.

00:47:02.140 --> 00:47:05.140
And the reason we do that is
because what we have found

00:47:05.140 --> 00:47:08.200
is that one of the most
important factors to freshness

00:47:08.200 --> 00:47:11.524
and taste is the number
of days off of harvest.

00:47:11.524 --> 00:47:12.940
Everyone always
talks about roast,

00:47:12.940 --> 00:47:14.398
and roast date is
really important.

00:47:14.398 --> 00:47:17.680
Eh, it is, but I
think we're missing

00:47:17.680 --> 00:47:20.470
a huge part of it,
which is how old is it,

00:47:20.470 --> 00:47:23.050
how many days off of
the harvest is it?

00:47:23.050 --> 00:47:26.197
And so there's really two
buying seasons in the world.

00:47:26.197 --> 00:47:28.030
There's coffee from the
northern hemisphere,

00:47:28.030 --> 00:47:30.400
it all harvests at more
or less the same time.

00:47:30.400 --> 00:47:32.800
And countries in the southern
hemisphere, more or less

00:47:32.800 --> 00:47:34.310
harvest at the same time.

00:47:34.310 --> 00:47:38.620
And so we use as a rule, nine
months off of harvest, that's

00:47:38.620 --> 00:47:39.880
considered in season for us.

00:47:39.880 --> 00:47:41.380
And that's really
where you're going

00:47:41.380 --> 00:47:43.172
to get the peak of
flavors and freshness.

00:47:43.172 --> 00:47:44.380
And I use that as an example.

00:47:44.380 --> 00:47:45.460
I mean, that's just--

00:47:45.460 --> 00:47:47.835
again, we're just scratching
the surface with this stuff.

00:47:47.835 --> 00:47:50.090
There's so much more
complexity-- as you know--

00:47:50.090 --> 00:47:51.130
to coffee.

00:47:51.130 --> 00:47:53.440
And we as an industry,
I think, have

00:47:53.440 --> 00:47:56.330
to continue to push
consumers to understand,

00:47:56.330 --> 00:48:00.550
hey, there's all these different
variables that affect flavor,

00:48:00.550 --> 00:48:04.510
and we need to educate consumers
around what coffees they like,

00:48:04.510 --> 00:48:09.400
and then take them on a journey
in their coffee life, you know?

00:48:09.400 --> 00:48:12.790
If you really like the pulp
natural from Brazil, that's

00:48:12.790 --> 00:48:15.760
great, we're going to kind
of introduce you there,

00:48:15.760 --> 00:48:17.410
then we might take
you to Peru, then we

00:48:17.410 --> 00:48:19.034
might take you to
Honduras, and then we

00:48:19.034 --> 00:48:21.070
might take you to East Africa.

00:48:21.070 --> 00:48:24.670
There's really, I think, an
evolution in most consumers

00:48:24.670 --> 00:48:27.057
coffee journeys, their lives.

00:48:27.057 --> 00:48:27.991
[INAUDIBLE]

00:48:27.991 --> 00:48:30.550
MICHAEL SHERIDAN: Yeah, I mean,
I see both of those things.

00:48:30.550 --> 00:48:35.950
I think at origin, there's going
to be a consolidation where

00:48:35.950 --> 00:48:38.680
we have fewer and fewer growers
of small-- fewer and fewer

00:48:38.680 --> 00:48:40.180
smallholder growers.

00:48:40.180 --> 00:48:42.880
And I think that we're going
to get this really bifurcated

00:48:42.880 --> 00:48:47.500
market with commodity growers,
and then craft growers,

00:48:47.500 --> 00:48:49.990
really hyper focused on
quality and incorporating more

00:48:49.990 --> 00:48:52.589
technology and more precision.

00:48:52.589 --> 00:48:54.130
In the marketplace
side, I'm not sure

00:48:54.130 --> 00:48:56.470
if it's what I
believe will happen

00:48:56.470 --> 00:48:57.804
or what I just hope will happen.

00:48:57.804 --> 00:48:59.220
AUDIENCE: I'll
take it either way.

00:48:59.220 --> 00:48:59.800
[LAUGHTER]

00:48:59.800 --> 00:49:02.300
MICHAEL SHERIDAN: One of
the things that has been,

00:49:02.300 --> 00:49:06.280
frankly, a little frustrating
for specialty coffee people,

00:49:06.280 --> 00:49:08.900
James has talked about this idea
of coffee is culinary for us

00:49:08.900 --> 00:49:09.920
as a core belief.

00:49:09.920 --> 00:49:12.530
But when I meet
people who don't know

00:49:12.530 --> 00:49:17.927
what Intelligentsia is, well
my first thing is say, what?

00:49:17.927 --> 00:49:19.510
You don't know what
Intelligentsia is?

00:49:19.510 --> 00:49:22.000
But I try to explain it to
people, like family members who

00:49:22.000 --> 00:49:23.710
don't know what I
do, I say, well, it's

00:49:23.710 --> 00:49:25.960
like a farm to table
restaurant for coffee.

00:49:25.960 --> 00:49:27.907
And I think so much of
what's exciting about--

00:49:27.907 --> 00:49:29.740
and has been exciting
about our food culture

00:49:29.740 --> 00:49:32.760
over the last 10 or
20 years, the idea

00:49:32.760 --> 00:49:34.480
that James mentioned
of seasonality,

00:49:34.480 --> 00:49:38.440
of relentless search for
flavor, local ingredients,

00:49:38.440 --> 00:49:40.360
fresh ingredients.

00:49:40.360 --> 00:49:43.180
All of those things that make
our food culture so exciting

00:49:43.180 --> 00:49:45.550
are really fundamental to
the way we source coffee

00:49:45.550 --> 00:49:48.470
and the way we try to position
coffee in the marketplace.

00:49:48.470 --> 00:49:51.064
And I feel like there has
been-- coffee hasn't--

00:49:51.064 --> 00:49:53.230
we see ourselves very much
as part of that movement.

00:49:53.230 --> 00:49:58.180
And in some senses, the work
that we've done in our sourcing

00:49:58.180 --> 00:50:01.630
predates a lot of the work
that's been done in food.

00:50:01.630 --> 00:50:04.120
But we haven't been
mapped into that.

00:50:04.120 --> 00:50:06.820
And so we talk a lot
about wine in coffee,

00:50:06.820 --> 00:50:09.022
and I think it's
probably a case of envy,

00:50:09.022 --> 00:50:10.480
where we want to
be more like wine.

00:50:10.480 --> 00:50:12.850
But we think it's
instructive and it's

00:50:12.850 --> 00:50:14.320
important in a lot of ways.

00:50:14.320 --> 00:50:16.600
Chemically, coffee is
more complex than wine.

00:50:16.600 --> 00:50:19.355
It has the same kind of things
that you think about wine.

00:50:19.355 --> 00:50:22.490
A vintage, well every
year, Finca Takesi

00:50:22.490 --> 00:50:23.870
produces a Geisha
varietal that's

00:50:23.870 --> 00:50:25.620
somewhat different
from the previous year.

00:50:25.620 --> 00:50:27.161
And it depends on
all the things that

00:50:27.161 --> 00:50:28.870
affect the vintages of wine.

00:50:28.870 --> 00:50:30.870
So there's a lot of really
good analogies there.

00:50:30.870 --> 00:50:33.360
And I think coffee--

00:50:33.360 --> 00:50:35.190
to James's point about
coffee's complexity

00:50:35.190 --> 00:50:38.040
being under-appreciated,
we feel like coffee's time

00:50:38.040 --> 00:50:39.720
is coming in terms
of being really

00:50:39.720 --> 00:50:42.560
appreciated as the culinary
product that it is.

00:50:42.560 --> 00:50:46.230
And as James said, we're
also searching for our role,

00:50:46.230 --> 00:50:48.960
and trying to help people
appreciate that, and help

00:50:48.960 --> 00:50:52.594
move specialty to that moment.

00:50:52.594 --> 00:50:53.760
I hope that's in our future.

00:50:53.760 --> 00:50:55.902
JOHN PETRENKO: Yeah, definitely

00:50:55.902 --> 00:50:57.360
AUDIENCE: So with
the wine analogy,

00:50:57.360 --> 00:51:00.810
I was kind of thinking about
when coffee has its "Sideways"

00:51:00.810 --> 00:51:03.490
moment, you know, how
that movie came out.

00:51:03.490 --> 00:51:05.320
But no, my question
is more about--

00:51:05.320 --> 00:51:07.560
the thing I've sort
of noticed and have

00:51:07.560 --> 00:51:09.320
commented when I-- so
I live in Lake View,

00:51:09.320 --> 00:51:10.804
and I go to Lake View Cafe.

00:51:10.804 --> 00:51:11.970
JAMES MCLAUGHLIN: Thank you.

00:51:11.970 --> 00:51:13.719
AUDIENCE: I noticed
[INAUDIBLE] I love it.

00:51:13.719 --> 00:51:19.020
And I feel a lot more like
it's an experiential thing when

00:51:19.020 --> 00:51:19.567
I go there.

00:51:19.567 --> 00:51:21.900
Like it feels much more
curated, not just the selection,

00:51:21.900 --> 00:51:23.560
but also--

00:51:23.560 --> 00:51:26.310
I feel myself approaching
it a little differently.

00:51:26.310 --> 00:51:28.370
And I have a spouse
who steadfastly

00:51:28.370 --> 00:51:29.370
refuses to drink coffee.

00:51:29.370 --> 00:51:30.000
He won't touch it.

00:51:30.000 --> 00:51:31.710
It frustrates the hell out
of me because I'm like,

00:51:31.710 --> 00:51:33.585
there's so many things
you're missing, right?

00:51:33.585 --> 00:51:35.400
And then I also have
friends who are like,

00:51:35.400 --> 00:51:37.110
I go to Dunkin' Donuts
and get a buzz on.

00:51:37.110 --> 00:51:41.829
And so, how does that spectrum--

00:51:41.829 --> 00:51:43.620
how do I make my friends
into coffee snobs?

00:51:43.620 --> 00:51:46.680
No, how do you view
the experiential bent

00:51:46.680 --> 00:51:48.780
that Intelligentsia
occupies as sort

00:51:48.780 --> 00:51:50.280
of that niche in the market?

00:51:50.280 --> 00:51:52.440
And how do you
expand that if you're

00:51:52.440 --> 00:51:54.540
talking about complexity
when a lot of people

00:51:54.540 --> 00:51:55.740
don't necessarily notice it?

00:51:55.740 --> 00:51:57.390
Is there like a
"Sideways" moment that you

00:51:57.390 --> 00:51:58.431
think the industry needs?

00:51:58.431 --> 00:51:59.880
Are you driving that?

00:51:59.880 --> 00:52:01.560
Is the supplier driving that?

00:52:01.560 --> 00:52:03.840
Are small neighborhood
places going to drive that?

00:52:03.840 --> 00:52:05.850
How do you see that happening?

00:52:05.850 --> 00:52:07.110
JAMES MCLAUGHLIN: Yeah.

00:52:07.110 --> 00:52:11.492
I think to answer at least
part of your question,

00:52:11.492 --> 00:52:13.200
we have this belief
that coffee should be

00:52:13.200 --> 00:52:14.890
treated as a culinary product.

00:52:14.890 --> 00:52:23.700
And so if we emulated the
traditional fast food model,

00:52:23.700 --> 00:52:27.160
I don't think we could have
gotten to where we have today.

00:52:27.160 --> 00:52:31.380
And so part of it is, we have
to do something different

00:52:31.380 --> 00:52:33.730
for customers to
come in and say,

00:52:33.730 --> 00:52:36.151
yeah, I'm OK paying $6
for a black cup of coffee

00:52:36.151 --> 00:52:38.400
even though I can go down
the street to Dunkin' Donuts

00:52:38.400 --> 00:52:39.165
and get it for $2.

00:52:42.730 --> 00:52:47.110
So having an experience,
a complete experience

00:52:47.110 --> 00:52:49.840
for customers I think is really
important for us as a brand.

00:52:52.890 --> 00:52:55.290
We don't have an
interest in having

00:52:55.290 --> 00:52:58.350
5,000 Intelligentsias
around Chicago,

00:52:58.350 --> 00:52:59.790
or around the United States.

00:52:59.790 --> 00:53:02.010
We want to keep
this pretty boutique

00:53:02.010 --> 00:53:08.630
and grow the brand through
the coffee bar experience,

00:53:08.630 --> 00:53:11.010
but then it's available in
a lot of different places,

00:53:11.010 --> 00:53:17.720
at your Whole Foods, at your
office, wherever it may be.

00:53:17.720 --> 00:53:20.300
But one thing that
we struggle with

00:53:20.300 --> 00:53:24.260
is, not everyone wants to wait
six minutes for a pour over.

00:53:24.260 --> 00:53:28.412
And particularly at our downtown
locations, it's something

00:53:28.412 --> 00:53:29.870
that we talk about
a lot, how do we

00:53:29.870 --> 00:53:32.900
meet customers where they
want a great cup of coffee,

00:53:32.900 --> 00:53:35.420
they're not willing
to wait six minutes?

00:53:35.420 --> 00:53:38.750
And it's something that,
candidly, we struggle with.

00:53:38.750 --> 00:53:42.590
Because we don't want it
to become fast foodie,

00:53:42.590 --> 00:53:46.340
right, like too much like a fast
food experience, because then

00:53:46.340 --> 00:53:48.570
we lose the credibility
around, hey,

00:53:48.570 --> 00:53:51.060
this is a culinary experience.

00:53:51.060 --> 00:53:53.737
But at the same time,
if there's customers

00:53:53.737 --> 00:53:55.820
that want to come in and
get a great cup of coffee

00:53:55.820 --> 00:53:58.620
but get it quickly, we
want to serve them too.

00:53:58.620 --> 00:54:02.090
And I think one of
the things that we--

00:54:02.090 --> 00:54:04.220
one of the cool parts of
getting to design a coffee

00:54:04.220 --> 00:54:08.159
bar every time we open one,
it's both maddening and cool

00:54:08.159 --> 00:54:10.700
because it's like, OK, we've
got to start from scratch again,

00:54:10.700 --> 00:54:12.660
we don't have this
cookie cutter template.

00:54:12.660 --> 00:54:15.020
But we do get to experiment
with service models.

00:54:15.020 --> 00:54:17.090
And so I'll give you an example.

00:54:17.090 --> 00:54:19.730
Like our Logan Square
shop here in Chicago,

00:54:19.730 --> 00:54:21.710
a barista comes over,
you sit at the bar,

00:54:21.710 --> 00:54:24.890
the barista will wait
on you, you can engage.

00:54:24.890 --> 00:54:27.500
The baristas will kind
of read the customer

00:54:27.500 --> 00:54:29.510
and try to figure out
how much they want

00:54:29.510 --> 00:54:31.010
to engage about the coffee.

00:54:31.010 --> 00:54:32.270
Like, do they want to
talk about the coffee

00:54:32.270 --> 00:54:33.395
or are they just here for--

00:54:33.395 --> 00:54:37.160
you know, they just want the cup
of coffee and leave me alone,

00:54:37.160 --> 00:54:39.020
I just woke up.

00:54:39.020 --> 00:54:40.190
So there's that experience.

00:54:40.190 --> 00:54:42.396
But then you can also
at the front of the bar,

00:54:42.396 --> 00:54:43.520
you can get a coffee to go.

00:54:43.520 --> 00:54:45.450
And it should be a
faster experience.

00:54:45.450 --> 00:54:49.760
And so I can't say that
we've cracked that nut,

00:54:49.760 --> 00:54:52.040
but it's definitely
something that we're still

00:54:52.040 --> 00:54:54.680
trying to figure out.

00:54:54.680 --> 00:54:55.679
Because I want to--

00:54:55.679 --> 00:54:57.470
I mean, one of the
things we all want to do

00:54:57.470 --> 00:55:01.310
is introduce more people,
your wife, your friends

00:55:01.310 --> 00:55:02.600
to this cup of coffee.

00:55:02.600 --> 00:55:05.330
Because I think once you
try it, you're hooked,

00:55:05.330 --> 00:55:08.270
and it's hard to go back
to the Dunkin' Donuts.

00:55:08.270 --> 00:55:12.190
MICHAEL SHERIDAN: I think also,
it should be said that we--

00:55:12.190 --> 00:55:15.620
our obsession with quality, we
have a lighter roast profile

00:55:15.620 --> 00:55:17.450
than most.

00:55:17.450 --> 00:55:19.460
And that really is
not by accident.

00:55:19.460 --> 00:55:23.420
I mean, it's a reflection
of the quality of the coffee

00:55:23.420 --> 00:55:25.610
that we source.

00:55:25.610 --> 00:55:27.710
One of my colleagues
recently put it so well,

00:55:27.710 --> 00:55:30.470
I think, for a
non-coffee person.

00:55:30.470 --> 00:55:34.610
He was saying that, if you get
a beautiful piece of tuna that's

00:55:34.610 --> 00:55:36.860
sushi grade, you don't
even have to cook it,

00:55:36.860 --> 00:55:38.760
you can just eat it.

00:55:38.760 --> 00:55:42.170
But if you get an old piece of
tuna that's not the best cut,

00:55:42.170 --> 00:55:44.850
you got to cook it for a long
time to make it palatable.

00:55:44.850 --> 00:55:46.520
And it's sort of like
that with coffee.

00:55:46.520 --> 00:55:49.020
We're sourcing some of
the world's finest coffee.

00:55:49.020 --> 00:55:53.480
You don't need to layer on all
of that caramelization and all

00:55:53.480 --> 00:55:56.390
that bitterness that you
get in the deep, dark roast.

00:55:56.390 --> 00:55:58.730
You can create something
really beautiful by letting

00:55:58.730 --> 00:56:02.180
your foot off the gas and
letting it breathe at a lighter

00:56:02.180 --> 00:56:03.590
roast profile.

00:56:03.590 --> 00:56:09.890
So we tend to regard the
really dark carbonized coffee

00:56:09.890 --> 00:56:12.190
as not culinary.

00:56:12.190 --> 00:56:14.960
You know, you're not
tasting the terroir,

00:56:14.960 --> 00:56:16.760
you're not tasting the
work, you're tasting

00:56:16.760 --> 00:56:19.280
the hand of the roaster.

00:56:19.280 --> 00:56:22.550
And so, you know,
most of us who are

00:56:22.550 --> 00:56:25.064
coffee professionals
in Intelligentsia,

00:56:25.064 --> 00:56:26.480
we don't reach for
the dark roast.

00:56:26.480 --> 00:56:29.510
But even our dark roast, we
try to reimagine the dark roast

00:56:29.510 --> 00:56:31.670
for a kind of a
specialty audience.

00:56:31.670 --> 00:56:36.950
So our dark roast, if you
put it next to a brand who

00:56:36.950 --> 00:56:41.690
shall not be mentioned, they're
occupying different planets.

00:56:41.690 --> 00:56:44.817
And so I think to your point,
meeting people where they are,

00:56:44.817 --> 00:56:46.400
and this idea of a
journey, and trying

00:56:46.400 --> 00:56:48.980
to help people
discover coffee, we

00:56:48.980 --> 00:56:52.120
want to have a dark roast
that's, hey, try this,

00:56:52.120 --> 00:56:53.300
reimagine your dark roast.

00:56:53.300 --> 00:56:56.060
It doesn't have to
taste like an ashtray.

00:56:56.060 --> 00:56:58.264
There's some nuance there,
there's some citrus,

00:56:58.264 --> 00:56:59.930
there's some sweetness,
but you're still

00:56:59.930 --> 00:57:04.580
getting that slight little
bite, and something that you go,

00:57:04.580 --> 00:57:06.740
oh, this is a different
kind of thing.

00:57:06.740 --> 00:57:09.560
And I think it should be said
as I look at three different tap

00:57:09.560 --> 00:57:12.260
systems in the back of the room,
part of the future of coffee

00:57:12.260 --> 00:57:15.190
is coffee as an ingredient,
and coffee as an ingredient

00:57:15.190 --> 00:57:18.120
in the broader beverage market.

00:57:18.120 --> 00:57:21.241
And so I think we can
look down our nose at some

00:57:21.241 --> 00:57:22.740
of those things,
or we can say, hey,

00:57:22.740 --> 00:57:24.890
this is an opportunity to
engage people and meet them

00:57:24.890 --> 00:57:26.810
where they are and where
they're having coffee

00:57:26.810 --> 00:57:28.820
with a product that's superior.

00:57:28.820 --> 00:57:30.987
And try to bring
them into a deeper

00:57:30.987 --> 00:57:33.320
appreciation for everything
that companies like ours do.

00:57:33.320 --> 00:57:34.000
JOHN PETRENKO: Very cool.

00:57:34.000 --> 00:57:35.960
SAM SABORI: Yeah, I think
that that "Sideways"

00:57:35.960 --> 00:57:38.090
moment is going to come
when everybody understands

00:57:38.090 --> 00:57:38.960
seasonality.

00:57:38.960 --> 00:57:43.520
And it's going to be, I'm not
drinking any past crop coffee.

00:57:43.520 --> 00:57:47.680
So I think if anything, anything
that we can really, really push

00:57:47.680 --> 00:57:50.720
is that seasonality
to say, if you're

00:57:50.720 --> 00:57:53.450
going to any cafe and
you order what's fresh,

00:57:53.450 --> 00:57:56.210
we found the freshest coffees
tend to perform better,

00:57:56.210 --> 00:58:01.830
whether or not the roast is
as ideal, or a little bit off.

00:58:01.830 --> 00:58:02.601
So there's that.

00:58:02.601 --> 00:58:04.850
And I think that's kind of
touching on the fourth wave

00:58:04.850 --> 00:58:07.440
also, is when the
customer understands

00:58:07.440 --> 00:58:09.172
what we're trying to do.

00:58:09.172 --> 00:58:11.130
I think that's where a
fourth wave-- when we're

00:58:11.130 --> 00:58:12.755
meeting the customer
and they're coming

00:58:12.755 --> 00:58:16.610
to us willing to pay $10, $15.

00:58:16.610 --> 00:58:19.250
Because I think that's
already out there,

00:58:19.250 --> 00:58:21.404
it's just very small--

00:58:21.404 --> 00:58:22.070
AUDIENCE: Right.

00:58:22.070 --> 00:58:22.610
SAM SABORI: Very
small companies.

00:58:22.610 --> 00:58:23.730
AUDIENCE: Like a tasting menu?

00:58:23.730 --> 00:58:24.350
SAM SABORI: Yeah, exactly.

00:58:24.350 --> 00:58:25.850
JAMES MCLAUGHLIN: Yeah, exactly.

00:58:25.850 --> 00:58:26.100
JOHN PETRENKO: All right.

00:58:26.100 --> 00:58:27.690
Well, I believe
we're out of time.

00:58:27.690 --> 00:58:28.280
I would like to thank--

00:58:28.280 --> 00:58:28.580
MICHAEL SHERIDAN: Thanks.

00:58:28.580 --> 00:58:30.800
JOHN PETRENKO: --James,
Sam, and Michael again,

00:58:30.800 --> 00:58:33.577
and the whole Intelligentsia
team for coming out to Google.

00:58:33.577 --> 00:58:34.410
This has been great.

00:58:34.410 --> 00:58:36.620
Come feel free to
bother us after this.

00:58:36.620 --> 00:58:38.690
And I believe there
will be coffee cocktails

00:58:38.690 --> 00:58:40.310
and some coffee
demos coming up soon.

00:58:40.310 --> 00:58:42.890
So let's give around of
applause for our guests.

00:58:42.890 --> 00:58:45.640
[APPLAUSE]
