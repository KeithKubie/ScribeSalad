00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
Let's go back to the experiment.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:06.000
We know he used an inclined plane to roll balls for the purpose of slowing down the motion.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:11.000
We know he used a water clock to measure time. This water clock couldn't measure seconds.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.000
He didn't know that the time this clock measured

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.000
was proportion of the amount of water collected in this collecting device,

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.000
so he collected this much water in your first experiment

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:23.000
and twice as much as water in your second experiment.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:27.000
The second experiment took twice this long. So how they did do the actual experiment?

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.000
First, you'll roll the ball for 1 unit of time,

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:33.000
and a unit here is to find some specified amount of water.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.000
You'll let the ball roll and then measure the distance.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:39.000
So maybe after 1 unit of time, the ball had gone from here to here.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.000
So how did Galileo do his experiment?

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:47.000
Well, you'll have the ball to roll for 1 unit of time or unit of time with a specified amount of water,

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.000
and you'll measure the distance.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.000
This distance you would call 1 unit of distance let say.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:58.000
So if the ball rolled from here to here in 1 unit of time, this became 1 unit of distance.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.000
Notice that Galileo wasn't really concerned

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:05.000
whether these units were seconds or minutes or meters or inches.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:10.000
He was looking for proportions and improportions.  These units always cancel out.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.000
So, Galileo really didn't care about these things.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:17.000
After he did that for 1 unit of time, he would allow the ball to roll for 2  units of time

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:21.000
and then measure the distance and again for 3 and 4 and so on.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:25.000
He'll keep doing this for 3 units of time, 4, 5, and so on,

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:29.000
and when he was done, he would repeat the entire experiment many many times,

00:01:29.000 --> 99:59:59.000
because more data means you can reduce your error, and we'll talk about that now.
