00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:01.680
Okay, so I'm going to talk a little bit about cookie

00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:04.190
expiration real quick and then we will move on. So

00:00:04.190 --> 00:00:08.080
let's let's, let's get our cookie. Okay, so, this cookie

00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:10.570
we've been working with. I've added an extra, an extra little

00:00:10.570 --> 00:00:13.860
parameter here called Expires. Which basically gives the cookie an

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:17.090
expiration date. And this means the browser will hang onto this

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:21.680
cookie until Tuesday, January 1st, 2025. That means you can

00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:25.270
close your browser you know, close your tab, whatever, come back

00:00:25.270 --> 00:00:27.910
to this website and the cookie will still be there. And if you

00:00:27.910 --> 00:00:29.930
don't include this Expires parameter, the

00:00:29.930 --> 00:00:32.340
cookie will expire. When you close your

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:33.770
browser. That's called a session cookie.

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:35.470
A session cookie, you know, basically has

00:00:35.470 --> 00:00:37.650
no Expires parameter. And so it'll disappear

00:00:37.650 --> 00:00:39.310
when you, when you close your browser.

00:00:39.310 --> 00:00:41.610
So depending on what you want to do, you know, if you want,

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:44.280
you know, how when sometimes you login? You know, you might, you might

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:47.560
have a login on, on, on, on a website. That has, you know,

00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:50.650
takes a user name and password and it has a checkbox for remember me.

00:00:50.650 --> 00:00:53.000
Basically what you're triggering here when you, when you check

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:57.190
this check-box is, whether or not to set an Expires parameter.

00:00:57.190 --> 00:00:59.230
So if you don't check it there will be no

00:00:59.230 --> 00:01:01.650
Expires parameter. And you'll be logged out when you close your

00:01:01.650 --> 00:01:04.250
browser. And if you do check it. Your, your cookie

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:06.530
that you get when you login will have an Expires parameter.

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:10.466
So that's generally what's going on there. You just deciding

00:01:10.466 --> 00:01:13.230
whether or not to include this extra parameter on your cookie.
