00:00:12.790 --> 00:00:13.416
So how many of you

00:00:13.416 --> 00:00:15.584
have ever been in a cave before?

00:00:15.584 --> 00:00:16.983
Okay, a few of you.

00:00:16.983 --> 00:00:17.958
When you think of a cave,

00:00:17.958 --> 00:00:19.028
most of you think of a tunnel

00:00:19.028 --> 00:00:20.709
going through solid rock.

00:00:20.709 --> 00:00:22.642
In fact, that's how most caves are.

00:00:22.642 --> 00:00:24.160
Around this half of the country,

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:26.680
most of your caves are made of limestone.

00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:26.984
Back where I'm from,

00:00:26.984 --> 00:00:28.876
most of our caves are made from lava rock

00:00:28.876 --> 00:00:31.105
because we have a lot of volcanoes out there.

00:00:31.105 --> 00:00:32.516
But the caves I want to share with you today

00:00:32.516 --> 00:00:34.234
are made completely of ice,

00:00:34.234 --> 00:00:35.949
specifically glacier ice

00:00:35.949 --> 00:00:37.777
as formed in the side of the tallest mountain

00:00:37.777 --> 00:00:39.061
in the state of Oregon

00:00:39.061 --> 00:00:40.932
called Mount Hood.

00:00:40.932 --> 00:00:43.580
Now, Mount Hood's only one hour's drive

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:44.275
from Portland,

00:00:44.275 --> 00:00:45.614
the largest city in Oregon

00:00:45.614 --> 00:00:47.907
where over two million people live.

00:00:47.907 --> 00:00:49.169
Now, the most exciting thing

00:00:49.169 --> 00:00:50.268
for a cave explorer

00:00:50.268 --> 00:00:51.640
is to find a new cave

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:54.137
and be the first human to ever go into it.

00:00:54.137 --> 00:00:55.442
The second most exciting thing

00:00:55.442 --> 00:00:56.209
for a cave explorer

00:00:56.209 --> 00:00:58.486
is to be the first one to make a map of a cave.

00:00:58.486 --> 00:00:59.224
Now, these days,

00:00:59.224 --> 00:01:00.604
with so many people hiking around,

00:01:00.604 --> 00:01:02.854
it's pretty hard to find a new cave,

00:01:02.854 --> 00:01:03.986
so you can imagine how excited

00:01:03.986 --> 00:01:05.801
we were to find three new caves

00:01:05.801 --> 00:01:08.157
within sight of Oregon's largest city

00:01:08.157 --> 00:01:10.061
and realize that they have never been explored

00:01:10.061 --> 00:01:11.409
or mapped before.

00:01:11.409 --> 00:01:12.756
It was kind of like being an astronaut

00:01:12.756 --> 00:01:14.295
because we were getting to see things

00:01:14.295 --> 00:01:15.720
and go places

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:17.736
that no one had ever seen or gone before.

00:01:18.505 --> 00:01:20.181
So, what is a glacier?

00:01:20.181 --> 00:01:21.422
Well, those of you that have ever seen

00:01:21.422 --> 00:01:22.434
or touched snow,

00:01:22.434 --> 00:01:23.488
you know that it's really light

00:01:23.488 --> 00:01:24.843
because it's just a bunch of tiny ice crystals

00:01:24.843 --> 00:01:25.876
clumped together

00:01:25.876 --> 00:01:27.347
and it's mostly air.

00:01:27.347 --> 00:01:28.713
If you squish a handful of snow

00:01:28.713 --> 00:01:29.759
to make a snowball,

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:31.888
it gets really small, hard, and dense.

00:01:31.888 --> 00:01:33.960
Well, in a mountain like Hood

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:35.139
where it snows over twenty feet a year,

00:01:35.139 --> 00:01:37.450
it crushes the air out of it

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:40.348
and gradually forms it into hard, blue ice.

00:01:40.348 --> 00:01:42.087
Now, each year more and more ice

00:01:42.087 --> 00:01:43.305
stacks up on top of it

00:01:43.305 --> 00:01:45.125
and eventually gets so heavy

00:01:45.125 --> 00:01:47.180
that it starts to slide down the mountain

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:48.546
under its own weight,

00:01:48.546 --> 00:01:50.805
forming a slow-moving river of ice.

00:01:50.805 --> 00:01:53.136
When an ice pack like that starts to move,

00:01:53.136 --> 00:01:54.390
we call it a glacier

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:55.462
and we give it a name.

00:01:55.462 --> 00:01:57.016
The name of the glacier these caves were formed

00:01:57.016 --> 00:01:58.831
is the Sandy Glacier.

00:01:58.831 --> 00:02:02.270
Now, each year as new snow lands on the glacier,

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:03.889
it melts in the summer sun,

00:02:03.889 --> 00:02:05.691
and it forms little rivers of water

00:02:05.691 --> 00:02:06.858
on the flow along the ice

00:02:06.858 --> 00:02:07.981
and they start to melt

00:02:07.981 --> 00:02:09.563
and bore their way down through the glacier,

00:02:09.563 --> 00:02:11.779
forming big networks of caves,

00:02:11.779 --> 00:02:13.115
sometimes going all the way down

00:02:13.115 --> 00:02:14.973
to the underlying bedrock.

00:02:14.973 --> 00:02:17.428
Now, the crazy thing about glacier caves

00:02:17.428 --> 00:02:20.410
is that each year new tunnels form,

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:21.521
different waterfalls pop up

00:02:21.521 --> 00:02:22.903
or move around from place to place

00:02:22.903 --> 00:02:24.290
inside the cave.

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:25.790
Warm water from the top of the ice

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:27.269
is boring its way down,

00:02:27.269 --> 00:02:29.319
and warm air from below the mountain

00:02:29.319 --> 00:02:30.559
actually rises up,

00:02:30.559 --> 00:02:31.710
gets into the cave,

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:34.597
and melts the ceilings back taller and taller.

00:02:34.597 --> 00:02:36.388
But the weirdest thing about glacier caves

00:02:36.388 --> 00:02:38.470
is that the entire cave is moving

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:40.431
because it's formed inside a block of ice

00:02:40.431 --> 00:02:42.136
the size of a small city

00:02:42.136 --> 00:02:45.021
that's slowly sliding down the mountain.

00:02:45.021 --> 00:02:46.448
Now, this is Brent McGregor,

00:02:46.448 --> 00:02:48.393
my cave exploration partner.

00:02:48.393 --> 00:02:50.666
He and I have both been exploring caves a long time

00:02:50.666 --> 00:02:53.970
and we've been climbing mountains a long time,

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:54.469
but neither of us have ever really explored

00:02:54.469 --> 00:02:56.188
a glacier cave before.

00:02:56.188 --> 00:02:59.265
Back in 2011, Brent saw a YouTube video

00:02:59.265 --> 00:03:00.300
of a couple of hikers

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:01.641
that stumbled across the entrance

00:03:01.641 --> 00:03:02.808
to one of these caves.

00:03:02.808 --> 00:03:04.699
There were no GPS coordinates for it,

00:03:04.699 --> 00:03:06.138
and all we knew was that it was somewhere

00:03:06.138 --> 00:03:08.200
out on the Sandy Glacier.

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:09.106
So, in July of that year,

00:03:09.106 --> 00:03:10.404
we went out on the glacier,

00:03:10.404 --> 00:03:12.729
and we found a big crack in the ice.

00:03:12.729 --> 00:03:14.861
We had to build snow and ice anchors,

00:03:14.861 --> 00:03:16.105
so we could tie off ropes

00:03:16.105 --> 00:03:18.148
and repel down into the hole.

00:03:18.148 --> 00:03:20.610
This is me looking into the entrance crevasse.

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:21.727
At the end of this hole,

00:03:21.727 --> 00:03:23.213
we found a huge tunnel

00:03:23.213 --> 00:03:24.563
going right up the mountain

00:03:24.563 --> 00:03:27.269
underneath thousands of tons of glacier ice.

00:03:27.269 --> 00:03:28.523
We followed this cave back

00:03:28.523 --> 00:03:31.274
for about a half mile until it came to an end.

00:03:31.274 --> 00:03:33.326
And then with the help of our survey tools,

00:03:33.326 --> 00:03:35.407
we made a three-dimensional map of the cave

00:03:35.407 --> 00:03:37.108
on our way back out.

00:03:37.108 --> 00:03:39.106
So, how do you map a cave?

00:03:39.106 --> 00:03:41.731
Well, cave maps aren't like trail maps or road maps

00:03:41.731 --> 00:03:43.280
because they have pits and holes

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:45.020
going to overlapping levels.

00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:46.105
To make a cave map,

00:03:46.105 --> 00:03:47.478
you have to set up survey stations

00:03:47.478 --> 00:03:49.280
every few feet inside the cave,

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:51.397
and you use a laser to measure the distance

00:03:51.397 --> 00:03:52.945
between those stations.

00:03:52.945 --> 00:03:55.620
And you use a compass and an inclinometer

00:03:55.620 --> 00:03:57.147
to measure the direction the cave is headed

00:03:57.147 --> 00:03:59.897
and measure the slope of the floor and the ceilings.

00:03:59.897 --> 00:04:01.613
Now, those of you taking trigonometry,

00:04:01.613 --> 00:04:03.142
that particular type of math

00:04:03.142 --> 00:04:05.269
is very useful for making maps like this

00:04:05.269 --> 00:04:06.432
because it allows you to measure

00:04:06.432 --> 00:04:07.599
heights and distances

00:04:07.599 --> 00:04:09.682
without actually having to go there.

00:04:09.682 --> 00:04:12.028
In fact, the more I mapped and studied caves,

00:04:12.028 --> 00:04:13.861
the more useful I found all that math

00:04:13.861 --> 00:04:16.105
that I originally hated in school to be.

00:04:16.105 --> 00:04:17.826
So, when you're done surveying,

00:04:17.826 --> 00:04:18.974
you take all this data,

00:04:18.974 --> 00:04:20.570
you punch it into the computer,

00:04:20.570 --> 00:04:21.140
and you find someone

00:04:21.140 --> 00:04:22.810
that can draw really well,

00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:24.452
and you have them draft up a map

00:04:24.452 --> 00:04:26.366
that looks something like this.

00:04:26.366 --> 00:04:27.401
And it will show you both

00:04:27.401 --> 00:04:29.224
a bird's eye view of the passage

00:04:29.224 --> 00:04:31.950
as well as a profile view of the passage,

00:04:31.950 --> 00:04:33.611
kind of like an ant farm view.

00:04:33.611 --> 00:04:35.534
We named this cave Snow Dragon Cave

00:04:35.534 --> 00:04:36.983
because it was like a big dragon

00:04:36.983 --> 00:04:38.642
sleeping under the snow.

00:04:38.642 --> 00:04:39.651
Now, later this summer

00:04:39.651 --> 00:04:41.309
as more snow melted off the glacier,

00:04:41.309 --> 00:04:42.433
we found more caves,

00:04:42.433 --> 00:04:44.913
and we realized they were all connected.

00:04:44.913 --> 00:04:46.861
Not long after we mapped Snow Dragon,

00:04:46.861 --> 00:04:48.560
Brent discovered this new cave

00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:49.901
not very far away.

00:04:49.901 --> 00:04:52.102
The inside of it was coated with ice

00:04:52.102 --> 00:04:53.567
so we had to wear big spikes

00:04:53.567 --> 00:04:55.233
in our feet called crampons,

00:04:55.233 --> 00:04:57.451
so we could walk around without slipping.

00:04:57.451 --> 00:04:59.311
This cave was amazing!

00:04:59.311 --> 00:05:01.784
The ice in the ceiling was glowing blue and green

00:05:01.784 --> 00:05:03.282
because the sunlight from far above

00:05:03.282 --> 00:05:04.738
was shining through the ice

00:05:04.738 --> 00:05:06.434
and lighting it all up.

00:05:06.434 --> 00:05:07.700
Now, we couldn't understand why this cave

00:05:07.700 --> 00:05:09.937
was so much colder than Snow Dragon

00:05:09.937 --> 00:05:11.227
until we got to the end,

00:05:11.227 --> 00:05:12.786
and we found out why.

00:05:12.786 --> 00:05:15.731
There was a huge pit or shaft called a moulin

00:05:15.731 --> 00:05:17.737
going a 130 feet straight up

00:05:17.737 --> 00:05:19.397
to the surface of the glacier.

00:05:19.397 --> 00:05:20.943
Cold air from the top of the mountain

00:05:20.943 --> 00:05:22.527
was flowing down this hole,

00:05:22.527 --> 00:05:23.930
blasting through the cave,

00:05:23.930 --> 00:05:26.147
freezing everything inside of it.

00:05:26.147 --> 00:05:28.203
And we were so excited about finding this new pit,

00:05:28.203 --> 00:05:30.606
we actually came back in January the following year

00:05:30.606 --> 00:05:33.149
so we could be the first ones to explore it.

00:05:33.149 --> 00:05:34.601
It was so cold outside,

00:05:34.601 --> 00:05:37.111
we actually had to sleep inside the cave.

00:05:37.111 --> 00:05:38.935
Here's our camp on the left side

00:05:38.935 --> 00:05:40.781
of this entrance room.

00:05:40.781 --> 00:05:42.817
The next morning we climbed out of the cave

00:05:42.817 --> 00:05:44.027
and hiked all the way

00:05:44.027 --> 00:05:45.325
to the top of the glacier

00:05:45.325 --> 00:05:47.604
where we finally rigged and repelled this pit

00:05:47.604 --> 00:05:49.333
for the very first time.

00:05:49.333 --> 00:05:51.684
Brent named this cave Pure Imagination, I think,

00:05:51.684 --> 00:05:53.305
because the beautiful sights we saw in there

00:05:53.305 --> 00:05:55.885
were beyond what we could have ever imagined.

00:05:55.885 --> 00:05:57.299
So, besides really cool ice,

00:05:57.299 --> 00:05:59.130
what else is inside these caves?

00:05:59.130 --> 00:06:00.966
Well, not too much lives in them

00:06:00.966 --> 00:06:01.932
because they're so cold,

00:06:01.932 --> 00:06:03.679
and the entrance is actually covered up with snow

00:06:03.679 --> 00:06:05.606
for about eight months of the year,

00:06:05.606 --> 00:06:07.631
but there are some really cool things in there.

00:06:07.631 --> 00:06:09.898
There's weird bacteria living in the water

00:06:09.898 --> 00:06:11.942
that actually eat and digest rocks

00:06:11.942 --> 00:06:13.335
to make their own food

00:06:13.335 --> 00:06:15.099
to live under this ice.

00:06:15.099 --> 00:06:16.352
In fact, this past summer

00:06:16.352 --> 00:06:18.996
scientists collected samples of water and ice

00:06:18.996 --> 00:06:21.928
specifically to see if things called extremophiles,

00:06:21.928 --> 00:06:23.685
tiny lifeforms that have evolved

00:06:23.685 --> 00:06:25.766
to live in a completely hostile conditions,

00:06:25.766 --> 00:06:27.624
might be living under the ice,

00:06:27.624 --> 00:06:28.794
kind of like what they hope to find

00:06:28.794 --> 00:06:31.180
in the polar ice caps of Mars some day.

00:06:31.180 --> 00:06:32.279
Another really cool thing

00:06:32.279 --> 00:06:33.826
is that as seeds and birds land

00:06:33.826 --> 00:06:35.727
on the surface of the glacier and die,

00:06:35.727 --> 00:06:37.139
they get buried in the snow

00:06:37.139 --> 00:06:39.191
and gradually become part of the glacier,

00:06:39.191 --> 00:06:41.467
sinking deeper and deeper into the ice.

00:06:41.467 --> 00:06:42.691
As these caves form

00:06:42.691 --> 00:06:44.379
and melt their way up into the ice,

00:06:44.379 --> 00:06:46.895
they make these artifacts rain down from the ceiling

00:06:46.895 --> 00:06:48.436
and fall into the cave floor

00:06:48.436 --> 00:06:49.882
where we end up finding them.

00:06:49.882 --> 00:06:52.883
For example, this is a nodal first seed we found.

00:06:52.883 --> 00:06:55.299
It's been frozen in ice for over a hundred years,

00:06:55.299 --> 00:06:57.643
and it's just now starting to sprout.

00:06:57.643 --> 00:07:01.180
This mallard duck feather was found over 1800 feet

00:07:01.180 --> 00:07:03.097
in the back of Snow Dragon Cave.

00:07:03.097 --> 00:07:04.332
This duck died on the surface

00:07:04.332 --> 00:07:05.865
of the glacier long, long ago,

00:07:05.865 --> 00:07:07.564
and its feathers have finally made it down

00:07:07.564 --> 00:07:09.282
through over a hundred feet of ice

00:07:09.282 --> 00:07:11.567
before falling inside the cave.

00:07:11.567 --> 00:07:12.864
And this beautiful quartz crystal

00:07:12.864 --> 00:07:15.093
was also found in the back of Snow Dragon.

00:07:15.093 --> 00:07:17.431
Even now Brent and I find it hard to believe

00:07:17.431 --> 00:07:18.588
that all these discoveries

00:07:18.588 --> 00:07:20.649
were essentially in our own backyard,

00:07:20.649 --> 00:07:23.168
hidden away just waiting to be found.

00:07:23.168 --> 00:07:24.430
Like I said earlier,

00:07:24.430 --> 00:07:25.446
the idea of discovery

00:07:25.446 --> 00:07:26.929
in this busy world we live in

00:07:26.929 --> 00:07:27.905
kind of seems like something

00:07:27.905 --> 00:07:30.165
you can only do with space travel now,

00:07:30.165 --> 00:07:31.427
but that's not true.

00:07:31.427 --> 00:07:33.660
Every year new caves get discovered

00:07:33.660 --> 00:07:35.718
that no one has ever been in before.

00:07:35.718 --> 00:07:36.707
So, it's actually not too late

00:07:36.707 --> 00:07:39.849
for one of you to become a discoverer yourself.

00:07:39.849 --> 00:07:41.352
You just have to be willing to look

00:07:41.352 --> 00:07:43.894
and go where people don't often go

00:07:43.894 --> 00:07:46.320
and focus your eyes and your mind

00:07:46.320 --> 00:07:48.432
to recognize the discovery when you see it

00:07:48.432 --> 00:07:50.828
because it might be in your own backyard.

00:07:50.828 --> 00:07:52.338
Thank you very much.
