&gt;&gt; Jon:  WELCOME BACK.

00:00:02.502 --> 00:00:03.904
MY GUEST TONIGHT, HE IS A
RELIGIOUS SCHOLAR, A BEST

00:00:03.904 --> 00:00:05.906
SELLING AUTHOR, HIS
BOOKS INCLUDES "NO GOD BUT GOD"

00:00:05.906 --> 00:00:06.874
"ZEALOT."

00:00:06.874 --> 00:00:14.581
PLEASE WELCOME BACK TO THE
PROGRAM REZA ASLAN.

00:00:14.581 --> 00:00:15.415
 ( APPLAUSE ).

00:00:15.415 --> 00:00:17.184
&gt;&gt; HOW'S IT GOING?

00:00:17.184 --> 00:00:18.685
&gt;&gt; Jon:  IT IS GOING VERY
WELL.

00:00:18.685 --> 00:00:20.821
&gt;&gt; ALL RIGHT!

00:00:20.821 --> 00:00:22.890
&gt;&gt; Jon: BOY, YOUR PHONE MUST BE
RINGING OFF THE HOOK.

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:25.993
AS A MAN WHO STUDY--
&gt;&gt; THE GOD BUSINESS IS VERY

00:00:25.993 --> 00:00:26.660
GOOD.

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:27.461
&gt;&gt; Jon:  VERY GOOD RIGHT
NOW.

00:00:27.461 --> 00:00:28.228
&gt;&gt; YEAH, IT'S BEEN VERY GOOD TO
ME.

00:00:28.228 --> 00:00:29.229
&gt;&gt; Jon: BECAUSE OF HOW BAD IT
IS.

00:00:29.229 --> 00:00:30.530
&gt;&gt; YEAH. THERE'S ALWAYS
SOMETHING TO TALK ABOUT.

00:00:30.530 --> 00:00:35.135
&gt;&gt; Jon:  WHY-- YOU KNOW,
I'VE ALWAYS SAID RELIGION HAS

00:00:35.135 --> 00:00:43.477
GIVEN PEOPLE GREAT COMFORT IN A
WORLD TORN APART BY RELIGION.

00:00:43.477 --> 00:00:52.853
( LAUGHTER )
WHY HASN'T GOD JUST SETTLED

00:00:52.853 --> 00:00:53.787
THIS?

00:00:53.787 --> 00:00:55.989
&gt;&gt; YEAH, HE REALLY SHOULD,
JUST WHO'S RIGHT.

00:00:55.989 --> 00:00:56.990
JUST GET IT OVER WITH. YEAH.

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:59.059
&gt;&gt; Jon:  WHY?

00:00:59.059 --> 00:01:02.195
BECAUSE DOESN'T HE EVER THINK,
OKAY, OKAY, THIS HAS GONE ON

00:01:02.195 --> 00:01:03.363
LONG ENOUGH?

00:01:03.363 --> 00:01:05.365
&gt;&gt; WELL, LOOK, THE THING ABOUT
RELIGION THAT PEOPLE HAVE TO

00:01:05.365 --> 00:01:08.435
UNDERSTAND IS THAT IT'S FAR MORE
A MATTER OF IDENTITY THAN IT IS

00:01:08.435 --> 00:01:10.571
JUST A MATTER OF BELIEFS AND
PRACTICES.

00:01:10.571 --> 00:01:12.372
I MEAN, THOSE THINGS ARE
IMPORTANT.

00:01:12.372 --> 00:01:16.243
BUT WHEN YOU SAY, "I'M A JEW,
I'M A MUSLIM, I'M A CHRISTIAN,"

00:01:16.243 --> 00:01:19.646
YOU'RE MAKING AN IDENTITY
STATEMENT FAR MORE SO THAN A

00:01:19.646 --> 00:01:20.881
STATEMENT OF THE
THINGS YOU BELIEVE.

00:01:20.881 --> 00:01:25.352
I MEAN, LET ME PUT IT THIS WAY--
SEVEN OUT OF 10 AMERICANS CALL

00:01:25.352 --> 00:01:27.554
THEMSELVES CHRISTIANS, SEVEN OUT
OF 10 AMERICANS.

00:01:27.554 --> 00:01:28.622
THINK ABOUT THAT FOR A MINUTE.

00:01:28.622 --> 00:01:30.090
SEVEN OUT OF 10 AMERICANS.

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:31.625
SEVEN OUT OF 10 AMERICANS.

00:01:31.625 --> 00:01:32.693
&gt;&gt; Jon:  HOLD ON.

00:01:32.693 --> 00:01:34.928
I DON'T DO WELL WITH THIS.
&gt;&gt; YEAH IT'S NOT, YEAH --

00:01:34.928 --> 00:01:38.865
&gt;&gt; Jon: SO YOU'RE SAYING 135%.
&gt;&gt; YEAH, I'M SAYING --

00:01:38.865 --> 00:01:40.133
&gt;&gt; Jon: WAIT, HOLD ON.

00:01:40.133 --> 00:01:41.368
( LAUGHTER ).

00:01:41.368 --> 00:01:45.005
&gt;&gt; THAT MEANS THAT-- THAT MEANS
THAT-- YOU'VE GOT TO GET YOUR

00:01:45.005 --> 00:01:46.239
KIDS TO HELP.
&gt;&gt; Jon: RIGHT.

00:01:46.239 --> 00:01:48.275
&gt;&gt; THAT MEANS THAT SEVEN OUT OF
10 AMERICAN GOES TO CHURCH ON

00:01:48.275 --> 00:01:51.545
SUNDAY OR SEVEN OUT OF 10
AMERICANS READ THE BIBLE ON A

00:01:51.545 --> 00:01:52.479
REGULAR BASIS --

00:01:52.479 --> 00:01:53.580
&gt;&gt; Jon: I SEE WHAT YOU'RE
SAYING.

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:54.314
&gt;&gt; OR SEVEN OUT OF 10
AMERICANS CAN TELL YOU ANYTHING

00:01:54.314 --> 00:01:58.819
ABOUT JESUS --
&gt;&gt; Jon: RIGHT.

00:01:58.819 --> 00:01:59.319
&gt;&gt; EXCEPT THAT HE WAS BORN IN A
MAINCHER AND DIED ON A CROSS?

00:01:59.319 --> 00:02:00.687
NO, OF COURSE, NOT.

00:02:00.687 --> 00:02:05.859
THE VAST MAJORITY OF THAT 70%
WHEN SAY THEY I'M A CHRISTIAN

00:02:05.859 --> 00:02:10.130
THEY'RE MAKING A STATEMENT OF
THEIR IDENTITY THAT INCLUDES

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:10.530
THEIR NATIONALITY, THEIR
ETHNICITY, THEIR WORLD VIEW --

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:11.932
&gt;&gt; Jon: RIGHT.

00:02:11.932 --> 00:02:13.467
&gt;&gt; THEIR POLITICS. ALL OF THOSE
THINGS ARE WRAPPED UP.

00:02:13.467 --> 00:02:16.436
SO RELIGION IS ABOUT WHO YOU ARE
AS A PERSON AS MUCH AS IT IS

00:02:16.436 --> 00:02:19.573
ABOUT WHAT YOU BELIEVE AND THE
RITUALS THAT YOU PRACTICE.

00:02:19.573 --> 00:02:24.011
&gt;&gt; Jon: WHAT STRUCK ME ABOUT
WHEN YOU SAID THAT, YOU SAID

00:02:24.011 --> 00:02:28.482
SEVEN OUT OF 10 AMERICANS
IDENTIFY AS CHRISTIANS,

00:02:28.482 --> 00:02:28.782
IS THE WHOLE MERRY CHRISTMAS
HULLABALOO.

00:02:28.782 --> 00:02:30.017
&gt;&gt; YEAH.

00:02:30.017 --> 00:02:30.517
&gt;&gt; Jon: WHEN YOU SAY THAT IN A
STORE, YOU HAVE A 30% CHANCE OF

00:02:30.517 --> 00:02:32.519
BEING WRONG.

00:02:32.519 --> 00:02:33.687
&gt;&gt; OF OFFENDING SOMEBODY? YEAH.

00:02:33.687 --> 00:02:34.654
&gt;&gt; Jon: AND IT REALLY DOES, IT
WOULD BE ALMOST LIKE SAYING,

00:02:34.654 --> 00:02:39.459
"FROM NOW ON IN STORES
JUST SAY,' HELLO, SIR'."

00:02:39.459 --> 00:02:45.532
&gt;&gt; YEAH, YEAH. WELL, AS A
MUSLIM, WHENEVER SOMEBODY

00:02:45.532 --> 00:02:47.968
SAYS MERRY CHRISTMAS, I'M
OBLIGATED TO SAY ( BLEEP ) YOU.

00:02:47.968 --> 00:02:48.802
&gt;&gt; Jon:  WHAT? IS THAT TRUE?
&gt;&gt; YEAH.

00:02:48.802 --> 00:02:50.037
&gt;&gt; Jon: IS THAT IN THE KORAN?

00:02:50.037 --> 00:02:51.071
&gt;&gt; IT'S IN THE KORAN. IT'S IN
THE KORAN. YEAH.

00:02:51.071 --> 00:02:51.872
&gt;&gt; Jon: I HAD NO IDEA. 

00:02:51.872 --> 00:02:52.773
I THOUGHT IT WAS PART OF THE
HADITH.

00:02:52.773 --> 00:02:55.108
I DIDN'T REALIZE THAT WAS IN THE
KORAN.

00:02:55.108 --> 00:02:59.212
BUT IT BRINGS UP SUCH AN
INTERESTING POINT BECAUSE I

00:02:59.212 --> 00:03:03.517
TRULY BELIEVE THAT IF YOU REMOVE
THE CONSTRUCT OF RELIGION--

00:03:03.517 --> 00:03:03.817
AND THAT'S WHY THIS DISCUSSION
OF ISLAM IS SO IMPORTANT.

00:03:03.817 --> 00:03:04.918
&gt;&gt; YEAH.

00:03:04.918 --> 00:03:05.719
&gt;&gt; Jon: BECAUSE NOW THE THREAD
IS THAT ISLAM OF ALL THE

00:03:05.719 --> 00:03:06.887
MONOTHEISTIC RELIGIONS --
&gt;&gt; RIGHT.

00:03:06.887 --> 00:03:10.657
&gt;&gt; Jon: IS PARTICULARLY PRONE
TO EXTREMISM, MAYBE IN THIS

00:03:10.657 --> 00:03:11.558
MOMENT, CERTAINLY THE OTHER
RELIGIONS HAVE HAD IT.

00:03:11.558 --> 00:03:14.294
&gt;&gt; YEAH. YEAH.

00:03:14.294 --> 00:03:16.897
&gt;&gt; Jon: BUT RELIGION IS MORE
THAN ANYTHING ELSE, A CHOICE BUT

00:03:16.897 --> 00:03:17.330
NOT VIEWED THAT WAY.

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:19.032
&gt;&gt; NO, IT'S NOT.

00:03:19.032 --> 00:03:20.700
BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY, I THINK

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:24.905
IT'S-- LOOK, THERE'S OBVIOUSLY A
SERIOUS PROBLEM WITH RELIGION--

00:03:24.905 --> 00:03:27.040
RELIGIOUS VIOLENCE IN THE WORLD,
AND PARTICULARLY IN ISLAM AND

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:28.175
THE MIDDLE EAST.

00:03:28.175 --> 00:03:30.944
BUT IF YOU'RE GOING TO BLAME
RELIGION FOR VIOLENCE IN THE

00:03:30.944 --> 00:03:34.448
NAME OF RELIGION, THEN YOU HAVE
TO CREDIT RELIGION FOR EVERY ACT

00:03:34.448 --> 00:03:36.116
OF COMPASSION IN THE NAME OF
RELIGION.

00:03:36.116 --> 00:03:39.786
YOU HAVE TO CREDIT RELIGION FOR
EVERY ACT OF LOVE IN THE NAME OF

00:03:39.786 --> 00:03:40.654
RELIGION.

00:03:40.654 --> 00:03:42.622
AND THAT'S NOT WHAT PEOPLE
USUALLY THINK.

00:03:42.622 --> 00:03:44.424
I MEAN, THEY FOCUS VERY MUCH ON
THE NEGATIVES.

00:03:44.424 --> 00:03:49.362
PART OF THE PROBLEM IS THAT
THERE'S THIS MISCONCEPTION THAT

00:03:49.362 --> 00:03:51.398
PEOPLE DERIVE THEIR VALUES FROM
THEIR SCRIPTURES.

00:03:51.398 --> 00:03:55.268
AND THE TRUTH IS THAT IT'S MORE
OFTEN THE CASE THAT PEOPLE

00:03:55.268 --> 00:03:58.238
INSERT THEIR VALUES INTO THEIR
SCRIPTURES.

00:03:58.238 --> 00:04:00.907
I MEAN, OTHERWISE, EVERY
CHRISTIAN WHO READ THIS

00:04:00.907 --> 00:04:02.042
BIBLE WOULD READ IT EXACTLY
THE SAME WAY.

00:04:02.042 --> 00:04:06.079
IN THIS COUNTRY, NOT 200 YEARS
AGO, BOTH SLAVE OWNERS AND

00:04:06.079 --> 00:04:08.882
ABOLITIONISTS NOT ONLY USED THE
SAME BIBLE TO JUSTIFY THEIR

00:04:08.882 --> 00:04:09.683
VIEWPOINTS.

00:04:09.683 --> 00:04:11.084
THEY USED THE SAME VERSES TO DO
SO.

00:04:11.084 --> 00:04:13.653
I MEAN, THAT'S THE THING ABOUT
SCRIPTURE.

00:04:13.653 --> 00:04:16.623
ITS POWER COMES FROM ITS
MALLEABILITY.

00:04:16.623 --> 00:04:18.992
YOU CAN READ IT IN ANY WAY YOU
WANT TO.

00:04:18.992 --> 00:04:22.963
IF YOU ARE A VIOLENT MISOGYNIST,
YOU WILL FIND PLENTY IN THE

00:04:22.963 --> 00:04:24.798
KORAN OR THE BIBLE TO
JUSTIFY YOUR VIEWPOINT.

00:04:24.798 --> 00:04:27.768
IF YOU'RE A PEACEFUL FEMINIST,
YOU WILL FIND JUST AS MUCH IN

00:04:27.768 --> 00:04:30.270
THOSE SCRIPTURES TO JUSTIFY YOUR
VIEWPOINT.

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:34.374
&gt;&gt; Jon:  WHAT IF YOU'RE A
JEW WHO LOVES A BACON EGG

00:04:34.374 --> 00:04:35.208
CROISSAN'WICH?

00:04:35.208 --> 00:04:36.076
IS THERE-- IS THERE SOMETHING
FOR ME?

00:04:36.076 --> 00:04:39.112
&gt;&gt; THAT MIGHT BE --
&gt;&gt; Jon: JUST AS A --

00:04:39.112 --> 00:04:40.447
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
THERE'S GOT TO BE SOMETHING.

00:04:40.447 --> 00:04:44.217
&gt;&gt; I WOULD RECOMMEND THE BOOK OF
MORMON FOR YOU. THAT MIGHT --

00:04:44.217 --> 00:04:45.819
&gt;&gt; Jon: YES! I KNEW IT!
&gt;&gt; BUT I MEAN --

00:04:45.819 --> 00:04:46.553
&gt;&gt; Jon: BUT THAT IS THE POINT.

00:04:46.553 --> 00:04:48.688
&gt;&gt; EXACTLY.

00:04:48.688 --> 00:04:51.558
THE POINT IS IS THAT WITHOUT
INTERPRETATION SCRIPTURE IS JUST

00:04:51.558 --> 00:04:52.792
WORDS ON A PAGE.

00:04:52.792 --> 00:04:56.663
IT REQUIRES SOMEBODY TO READ IT,
TO ENCOUNTER IT FOR IT TO HAVE

00:04:56.663 --> 00:04:59.733
ANY KIND OF MEANING, AND
OBVIOUSLY IN THAT TRANSACTION,

00:04:59.733 --> 00:05:02.802
YOU ARE BRINGING YOURSELF, YOUR
VIEWS, YOUR POLITICS, YOUR

00:05:02.802 --> 00:05:06.740
SOCIAL IDEAS INTO THE TEXT.

00:05:06.740 --> 00:05:12.245
HOW YOU READ SCRIPTURE HAS
EVERYTHING TO DO WITH WHO YOU

00:05:12.245 --> 00:05:12.913
ARE.

00:05:12.913 --> 00:05:15.115
GOD DOES NOT MAKE YOU A BIGOT.

00:05:15.115 --> 00:05:16.183
YOU'RE JUST A BIGOT.

00:05:16.183 --> 00:05:18.084
&gt;&gt; Jon:  THE VIOLENCE -- THAT'S
A GOOD POINT.

00:05:18.084 --> 00:05:21.021
AND THE VIOLENCE IN THAT
REGION IS AN OUTGROWTH OF

00:05:21.021 --> 00:05:24.124
PAUCITY OF MANY THINGS, RELIGION
NOT BEING THE SOLE DRIVER OF

00:05:24.124 --> 00:05:26.092
THESE IDENTITY DIFFICULTIES THAT
ARE GOING ON.

00:05:26.092 --> 00:05:28.295
&gt;&gt; THERE'S A LOT OF ISSUES THAT
ARE INVOLVED-- SOCIAL ISSUES,

00:05:28.295 --> 00:05:29.629
POLITICAL ISSUES, CULTURAL
ISSUES.

00:05:29.629 --> 00:05:30.463
ALL THOSE THINGS.

00:05:30.463 --> 00:05:31.064
&gt;&gt; Jon:  WILL YOU STICK
AROUND AROUND.

00:05:31.064 --> 00:05:31.932
&gt;&gt; YEAH.

00:05:31.932 --> 00:05:32.599
&gt;&gt; Jon: WE'LL TALK A LITTLBE BIT
ABOUT --

00:05:32.599 --> 00:05:34.134
&gt;&gt; HOW TO FIX THE MIDDLE EAST?

00:05:34.134 --> 00:05:34.901
&gt;&gt; Jon: IT'D BE NICE.

00:05:34.901 --> 00:05:36.136
&gt;&gt; LET'S DO THIS.

00:05:36.136 --> 00:05:37.671
&gt;&gt; Jon: ALL RIGHT. AND, BY THE
WAY, WE'RE NOT GOING TO DO IT ON

00:05:37.671 --> 00:05:38.538
AIR CAUSE THAT'D BE TOO EASY.

00:05:38.538 --> 00:05:42.209
WE'RE GOING TO DO IT ON THE WEB.
&gt;&gt; YEAH.

00:05:42.209 --> 00:05:44.077
&gt;&gt; Jon: THE PAPERBACK OF
"ZEALOT" IS ON THE

00:05:44.077 --> 00:05:44.544
BOOKSHELVES NOW.

00:05:44.544 --> 00:05:45.545
REZA ASLAN.
