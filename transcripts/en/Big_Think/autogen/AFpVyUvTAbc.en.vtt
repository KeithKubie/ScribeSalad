then travel to the brain and what it

00:00:28.729 --> 00:00:28.739
then travel to the brain and what it
 

00:00:28.739 --> 00:00:32.600
then travel to the brain and what it
does is it invades the hypothalamus

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:32.610
does is it invades the hypothalamus
 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:33.890
does is it invades the hypothalamus
which is the center of the brain that

which is the center of the brain that
 

00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:35.990
which is the center of the brain that
controls all our most fundamental drives

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:36.000
controls all our most fundamental drives
 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:37.880

another aspect of rabies and people is
 

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:27.469
another aspect of rabies and people is
that it makes people very sensitive to

00:01:27.469 --> 00:01:27.479
that it makes people very sensitive to
 

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:30.350
that it makes people very sensitive to
any kind of stimuli for so for example

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:30.360
any kind of stimuli for so for example
 

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:35.390
any kind of stimuli for so for example
even the lightest breeze can make

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:35.400
even the lightest breeze can make
 

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:40.570
even the lightest breeze can make
somebody agitated and people with rabies

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:40.580
somebody agitated and people with rabies
 

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:43.789

understands they become hydrophobic
 

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:51.950
understands they become hydrophobic
which is to say they are tormented by

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:51.960
which is to say they are tormented by
 

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:55.370

the sight of water or hearing you know
 

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:59.690
the sight of water or hearing you know
water splashing in a basin and if you

00:01:59.690 --> 00:01:59.700

hate light that's why they're nocturnal
 

00:02:07.009 --> 00:02:12.289
hate light that's why they're nocturnal
and in the 18th century when a lot of

00:02:12.289 --> 00:02:12.299
and in the 18th century when a lot of
 

00:02:12.299 --> 00:02:18.450
and in the 18th century when a lot of
vampire legends swept Eastern Europe

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:18.460
vampire legends swept Eastern Europe
 

00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:21.090
vampire legends swept Eastern Europe
was thought that pouring water around

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:21.100
was thought that pouring water around
 

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:23.280
was thought that pouring water around
the grave of a person would keep them

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:23.290
the grave of a person would keep them
 

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:25.800
the grave of a person would keep them
from rising at night and becoming a

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:25.810
from rising at night and becoming a
 

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:28.440
from rising at night and becoming a
vampire also in Eastern Europe at that

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:28.450
vampire also in Eastern Europe at that
 

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:31.410
vampire also in Eastern Europe at that
time it was believed and these weren't

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:31.420
time it was believed and these weren't
 

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:33.630
time it was believed and these weren't
just legends they believed that this was

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:33.640
just legends they believed that this was
 

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:36.150
just legends they believed that this was
a true risk it was thought that some

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:36.160
a true risk it was thought that some
 

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:39.720
a true risk it was thought that some
people could rise from their beds at

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:39.730
people could rise from their beds at
 

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:45.540
people could rise from their beds at
night and then assume the form of a dog

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:45.550
night and then assume the form of a dog
 

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:51.470
night and then assume the form of a dog
or wolf and attack people or rape people

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:51.480
or wolf and attack people or rape people
 

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:58.490
or wolf and attack people or rape people
so you can see how vampire legend has

00:02:58.490 --> 00:02:58.500
so you can see how vampire legend has
 

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:01.740
so you can see how vampire legend has
you know vampirism maybe in some ways

00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:01.750
you know vampirism maybe in some ways
 

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:05.490
you know vampirism maybe in some ways
inspired by what rabies does to people

00:03:05.490 --> 00:03:05.500
inspired by what rabies does to people
 

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:08.520
inspired by what rabies does to people
and of course vampires are most likely

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:08.530
and of course vampires are most likely
 

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:14.340
and of course vampires are most likely
to assume the form of dogs which we know

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:14.350
to assume the form of dogs which we know
 

00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:16.620
to assume the form of dogs which we know
are it can be you know one vector of

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:16.630
are it can be you know one vector of
 

00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:19.860
are it can be you know one vector of
rabies but also bats which can spread

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:19.870
rabies but also bats which can spread
 

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:22.200
rabies but also bats which can spread
rabies and then finally this is an

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:22.210
rabies and then finally this is an
 

00:03:22.210 --> 00:03:25.380
rabies and then finally this is an
interesting link it typically takes

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:25.390
interesting link it typically takes
 

00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:28.410
interesting link it typically takes
about 40 days from the time a person is

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:28.420
about 40 days from the time a person is
 

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:31.470
about 40 days from the time a person is
bitten by a rabid animal until their

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:31.480
bitten by a rabid animal until their
 

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:34.700
bitten by a rabid animal until their
death and vampires

00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:34.710
death and vampires
 

00:03:34.710 --> 00:03:39.480
death and vampires
according to legend lived 40 days
