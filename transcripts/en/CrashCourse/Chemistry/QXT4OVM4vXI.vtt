00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.929
Humans, like chemicals, are really all about
bonds.

00:00:02.929 --> 00:00:04.580
Think about all the relationships in your
life.

00:00:04.580 --> 00:00:08.320
You're a casual acquaintance to some people,
a colleague or friend to others,

00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:10.709
and maybe more to that someone special.

00:00:10.709 --> 00:00:13.669
Maybe you're dating someone casually, or you're
in a committed relationship, or you're married.

00:00:13.669 --> 00:00:16.240
There are all kinds of different combinations
of people out there.

00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:20.560
And sometimes, you know, people fall for a
vampire or a werewolf. Who am I to judge?

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:25.100
Fact is, each type of relationship requires
different things from you and the other person,

00:00:25.100 --> 00:00:28.800
but if you play your cards right, these relationships
allow you to relax

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:33.250
and escape the stresses that come with the
constant search for affection.

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:35.190
Distance is important in relationships too,
of course;

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:40.550
too much distance makes it hard to stay focused on each other and requires a lot of effort to keep things together,

00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:44.290
and I may not have to tell you, too little
distance can be a problem as well.

00:00:44.290 --> 00:00:45.980
Everyone needs their space, and when you don't
have any,

00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:48.470
you just end up pushing away from whatever's
crowding you.

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:50.510
In this way, atoms are a lot like us.

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:54.790
We call their relationships bonds, just like
we do with our own relationships.

00:00:54.790 --> 00:00:56.500
And there are many different types.

00:00:56.500 --> 00:00:59.469
Each kind of atomic relationship requires
a different type of energy,

00:00:59.469 --> 00:01:04.000
but they all do best when they settle into
the lowest-stress situation possible.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:08.580
The nature of the bond between atoms is related
to the distance between them, and, like people

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:13.900
(and vampires and werewolves, I suppose),
it also depends on how positive or negative they are.

00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:16.020
The difference is that, unlike human relationships,

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:21.460
we can analyze exactly what makes different
kinds of chemical relationships work.

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:23.049
And that's what this episode is all about.

00:01:23.049 --> 00:01:28.869
But, people, please remember that we here at Crash Course do not dispense relationship advice.

00:01:28.869 --> 00:01:38.189
[Theme Music]

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:41.729
First things first, why do atoms do this at
all?

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:47.169
Well, like everything else in the universe, atoms do whatever they can to reduce their overall energy,

00:01:47.169 --> 00:01:52.629
and they reach their lowest energy by achieving a balance between attractive and repulsive forces,

00:01:52.629 --> 00:01:55.220
being neither too clingy nor too aloof.

00:01:55.220 --> 00:02:00.620
So when two atoms approach each other, the electrons of each are attracted to the protons of the other.

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:03.119
This is the electrostatic force.

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:08.379
Like charges repel, opposites attract, like
in real life, or at least Paula Abdul songs.

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:09.880
I know, I'm old.

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:11.580
So when one atom is attracted to another,

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:16.450
just like Edward Cullen and Bella in chemistry
class, to use a slightly more timely reference,

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:21.360
it gets stressed out by the attractive force and tries to relieve the stress by getting closer.

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:25.640
We've all been there, right? That hot, nerdy
vampire girl in your chemistry class?

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:26.920
It's just, it's intense.

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:32.560
The pull is so strong that the stress level or energy rises when the two are separated, so they stay close.

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:34.599
But sometimes, they can get a little too close.

00:02:34.599 --> 00:02:38.060
When that happens, the nuclei repel each other
because of their like charges,

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:41.860
and the energy between them rapidly increases
and they both back off,

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:45.930
just enough to find that perfect little distance
between them, and everyone relaxes.

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:49.069
This ideal, wonderful distance is the bond
length.

00:02:49.069 --> 00:02:52.090
It's the distance between two nuclei at the
point of minimum energy.

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:56.140
In other words, where the attractive and repulsive
forces cancel each other out.

00:02:56.140 --> 00:02:59.220
The distance at which these two atoms of chlorine
reach their minimum energy,

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:01.950
caught between the attraction of the electrons,
the nucleus,

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:04.830
and the protons repelling the nuclei, is the
bond length.

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:09.840
That energy minimum, which we know absolutely
is â€“239 kilojoules per mole (kJ/mol),

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:15.260
occurs when the distance between the atoms
is 0.00199 nanometers (nm).

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:19.000
That distance is the bond length of Cl2, chlorine
gas.

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:22.349
Now because the electrons are attracted to
both nuclei in the molecule,

00:03:22.349 --> 00:03:25.950
they actually spend the majority of their
time in the space between them.

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:30.550
This is often described as sharing electrons,
and we call this kind of bond a covalent bond.

00:03:30.550 --> 00:03:33.629
But not all sharing is equal.
I should know: I have an older brother.

00:03:33.629 --> 00:03:38.170
The strength with which an atom holds shared
electrons is called its electronegativity.

00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:43.870
The electronegativities of various elements are all super well known and waiting for you in tables on the Internet.

00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:50.050
If two atoms in a bond have very different
electronegativities, like, say,
hydrogen at 2.1 and oxygen at 3.5,

00:03:50.050 --> 00:03:54.040
the electrons are more attracted to the atom
with the higher electronegativity.

00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:58.240
The difference is so great that the electrons spend most of their time around the stronger atom

00:03:58.250 --> 00:04:00.430
and much less time around the other one.

00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:04.069
Like how all the neighborhood kids wanted
to hang out with John, my older brother,

00:04:04.069 --> 00:04:05.610
because he was more charismatic.

00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:07.750
When the electrons hang out closer to one
side of the bond,

00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:12.830
it creates a slight negative charge in that area and a slight positive charge around the other atom.

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:19.140
This separation of charges is called polarity, and it's the polarity of the molecule that these atoms form, H2O,

00:04:19.150 --> 00:04:22.770
that makes water the most important molecule
on Earth.

00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:26.199
Covalent bonds like this, where electrons
are attracted to one atom more than the other,

00:04:26.199 --> 00:04:29.169
causing a separation of charges, are called
polar covalent bonds.

00:04:29.169 --> 00:04:32.860
But when a covalent bond forms between two
identical atoms,

00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:37.219
like the two chlorine atoms in our graph earlier,
the electrons are distributed evenly.

00:04:37.219 --> 00:04:39.249
We call this a non-polar covalent bond.

00:04:39.249 --> 00:04:42.710
But you've also gotta consider the middle
option, where atoms aren't identical,

00:04:42.710 --> 00:04:49.790
but have very similar electronegativities, like hydrogen, with an electronegativity of 2.1, and sulfur, at 2.5.

00:04:49.810 --> 00:04:54.779
The difference here is so tiny that the electrons
are pretty much still evenly distributed,

00:04:54.779 --> 00:04:57.430
and we call that a non-polar covalent bond
as well.

00:04:57.430 --> 00:05:00.369
There's a huge world of important chemicals
that have these kinds of bonds.

00:05:00.369 --> 00:05:03.860
So many, in fact, that we will dedicate a
couple of separate episodes to them.

00:05:03.860 --> 00:05:06.830
Covalent bonds tend to form from non-metals
and sometimes metalloids,

00:05:06.830 --> 00:05:09.969
those elements that have both metallic and
non-metallic characteristics.

00:05:09.969 --> 00:05:12.689
That's because most of them hold their electrons
so tightly

00:05:12.689 --> 00:05:17.099
that they're more likely to share them with
another atom than to gain or lose them altogether.

00:05:17.099 --> 00:05:20.099
Metals, on the other hand, have loosely-held
outer electron shells,

00:05:20.099 --> 00:05:23.430
so they're constantly dropping electrons and
becoming positive ions.

00:05:23.430 --> 00:05:27.750
And when positive ions come across negative ions, like those formed from halogens, for instance,

00:05:27.750 --> 00:05:29.240
you have to know what's gonna happen.

00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:32.680
They are attracted to each other, which means
energy is required to keep them apart,

00:05:32.680 --> 00:05:37.400
which means that they're gonna bond if they can, creating that oh-so-wonderful point of minimum energy.

00:05:37.400 --> 00:05:43.240
This type of bond is unsurprisingly called an ionic bond, a bond formed between a positive ion and a negative ion.

00:05:43.240 --> 00:05:46.639
Because the ions are formed when one atom
loses electrons and the other gains them,

00:05:46.640 --> 00:05:51.300
we often say that an ionic bond is formed by the transfer of electrons from one atom to another.

00:05:51.300 --> 00:05:55.399
And we can calculate the amount of energy
that exists in a bond between ions at a given

00:05:55.399 --> 00:05:58.020
distance using a formula called Coulomb's
law.

00:05:58.020 --> 00:06:03.340
Note that this only works for ionic bonds because the calculation requires the charges of the ions,

00:06:03.340 --> 00:06:05.240
which covalent bonds don't have.

00:06:05.249 --> 00:06:09.249
Coulomb's law says that the energy been two
ions equals the product of the two charges,

00:06:09.249 --> 00:06:12.520
which are represented by capital Qs, because
why not,

00:06:12.520 --> 00:06:15.770
divided by the distance, or radius, between
the two nuclei,

00:06:15.770 --> 00:06:21.629
all multiplied by a constant, 2.31 Ã— 10â€“19
joules per nanometer (Jâ€¢nm).

00:06:21.629 --> 00:06:25.060
Of course, the radius also has to be expressed in nanometers â€” you gotta make the units match.

00:06:25.060 --> 00:06:29.559
Let's see how it works with something simple:
sodium chloride, or table salt.

00:06:29.560 --> 00:06:34.680
We know that the normal charge on a sodium ion is +1 and the normal charge on chloride is -1.

00:06:34.680 --> 00:06:36.520
These are Q1 and Q2.

00:06:36.520 --> 00:06:41.249
The length of a stable NaCl bond is 0.276
nm, so we put that in for the radius,

00:06:41.249 --> 00:06:47.800
and finally a quick calculation tells us that
the bond contains â€“8.37 Ã— 10â€“19 J of energy.

00:06:47.800 --> 00:06:53.980
Remember, that negative number represents a decrease in the energy of the system due to an attractive force,

00:06:53.980 --> 00:06:56.119
which certainly makes sense here.

00:06:56.119 --> 00:07:00.240
Sodium and chloride ions are strongly attracted
to each other due to their opposite charges.

00:07:00.240 --> 00:07:06.240
Of course, you may have noticed that â€“8.37
Ã— 10â€“19 J looks like a tiny, tiny number,

00:07:06.240 --> 00:07:09.689
but keep in mind we're talking about one single
pair of ions.

00:07:09.689 --> 00:07:14.490
The â€“239 kJ that we got for chlorine? That
was for a whole mole of molecules.

00:07:14.490 --> 00:07:18.659
When multiplied by the 10^17 or so ions in
a single grain of table salt

00:07:18.659 --> 00:07:23.719
and then by the thousands of grains of salt
in a mole, the energy becomes much more significant.

00:07:23.719 --> 00:07:26.389
The NaCl bond is, in fact, quite strong.

00:07:26.389 --> 00:07:29.039
And because they are formed by a positive
ion and a negative ion,

00:07:29.039 --> 00:07:32.749
two charges completely separated between two
different particles,

00:07:32.749 --> 00:07:37.459
ionic bonds are extremely polar, way more
polar than polar covalent bonds.

00:07:37.459 --> 00:07:40.009
And so those are our three types of bonds:

00:07:40.009 --> 00:07:44.939
non-polar covalent, formed by the equal or
nearly equal sharing of two electrons between

00:07:44.939 --> 00:07:47.039
non-metal or metalloid atoms;

00:07:47.039 --> 00:07:51.729
polar covalent, formed by the uneven sharing
of electrons between two non-metals or metalloids;

00:07:51.729 --> 00:07:55.509
and ionic, formed by the transfer of electrons
from a metal to a non-metal.

00:07:55.509 --> 00:07:59.800
It's important to remember, though, that there aren't only three designations for chemical bonds.

00:07:59.800 --> 00:08:04.800
Just like human relationships, bonds don't
always have really well-defined boundaries.

00:08:04.800 --> 00:08:08.739
Everything is a continuum. Labels are useful,
but they can only take us so far.

00:08:08.740 --> 00:08:13.220
There are, however, certain properties that each kind of bond tends to have that you should know.

00:08:13.220 --> 00:08:17.800
For instance, ionic compounds are often crystalline
in their solid form because of the way the

00:08:17.809 --> 00:08:20.029
ions pack together, like salt is.

00:08:20.029 --> 00:08:24.020
They're generally soluble in water because
the two ions interact separately with the

00:08:24.020 --> 00:08:27.110
positively and negatively charged areas on
a water molecule.

00:08:27.110 --> 00:08:31.469
And once they're separated or dissolved, the
ions allow the solution to conduct electricity.

00:08:31.469 --> 00:08:36.880
Covalent compounds, on the other hand, tend to be softer solids, liquids, or gases like Cl2 is at room temperature.

00:08:36.880 --> 00:08:40.740
They're often not soluble in water, and even when they are, the solutions don't conduct electricity.

00:08:40.740 --> 00:08:44.099
The differences in these properties stem mostly
from the differences in their polarities.

00:08:44.100 --> 00:08:49.780
So yeah, polarity is crazy important. So important that we'll be doing a whole episode on it soon.

00:08:49.780 --> 00:08:54.000
Until then, I want to thank you for the bond
that you have to Crash Course Chemistry,

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:57.670
whether it's casual observer, faithful viewer,
or committed subscriber.

00:08:57.670 --> 00:08:59.360
Today, if you were paying attention,

00:08:59.360 --> 00:09:04.080
you learned that chemical bonds form in order to minimize the energy between two atoms or ions.

00:09:04.080 --> 00:09:08.120
You've also learned that the chemical bonds
may be covalent if the atoms share electrons,

00:09:08.120 --> 00:09:12.110
and that covalent bonds can share those electrons
evenly or unevenly.

00:09:12.110 --> 00:09:14.870
Bonds can also be ionic if the electrons are
transferred,

00:09:14.870 --> 00:09:19.100
and you learned how to calculate the energy transferred in an ionic bond using Coulomb's law.

00:09:19.100 --> 00:09:23.860
