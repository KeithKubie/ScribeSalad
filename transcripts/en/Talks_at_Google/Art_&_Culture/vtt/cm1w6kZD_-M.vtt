where you're from.

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:17.750
- Kolkata.

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:18.657
- Which part?

00:00:18.657 --> 00:00:19.240
- I'm adopted.

00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:20.340
I'm not really Indian.

00:00:23.650 --> 00:00:26.000
- I'm starting to remember.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.266
- Saroo, our beautiful boy.

00:00:28.266 --> 00:00:30.752
- We're very proud of you, son.

00:00:30.752 --> 00:00:33.172
- A life I'd forgotten.

00:00:34.624 --> 00:00:36.570
- Are you OK?

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:38.270
- I had another family--

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:40.470
a mother, a brother.

00:00:40.470 --> 00:00:43.080
I can still see their faces.

00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:44.445
- What happened?

my way back home.

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:11.915
- How long were
you on the train?

00:01:11.915 --> 00:01:13.045
- A couple of days.

00:01:13.045 --> 00:01:14.551

CASEY WHITELAW: Hi
everyone and thanks

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:37.660
for joining us here today.

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:41.310
So to celebrate the release
of "Lion," on Google Play--

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:45.090
boy, I've teared up in
there, I have to say.

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:47.830
Even watching the trailer
gets me, even now.

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:50.100
To celebrate the launch
of "Lion" on Google Play,

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:53.390
we have Saroo Brierley
here to do a fireside chat.

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:54.433
So welcome, Saroo.

00:02:54.433 --> 00:02:55.516
SAROO BRIERLEY: Thank you.

00:02:55.516 --> 00:02:56.480
Thanks for coming.

00:02:56.480 --> 00:02:59.372
[APPLAUSE]

00:03:00.336 --> 00:03:01.870
CASEY WHITELAW:
So Saroo's story--

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:04.450
and we're going to hear a lot
more about Saroo's story--

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:06.790
I think is particularly
special for us

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:11.900
here at Google Australia
for a couple of reasons.

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:15.640
Saroo's story is set for
a large part in Tasmania.

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:17.870
So it's a very Australian story.

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:20.940
And also, Google
in Australia, we've

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:23.590
been working on Google
Maps for many years now.

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:26.020
And so seeing the kind
of things that we've

00:03:26.020 --> 00:03:29.610
contributed to in the world I
think is really special for us.

00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:34.450
I think it's an amazing
representation of what Google's

00:03:34.450 --> 00:03:36.390
mission has done in the world.

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:40.510
So you know, Google's
mission is to organize

00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:43.180
the world's information and
make it universally accessible.

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:47.140
And through that, these amazing
stories, such as Saroo's story,

00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:50.880
become possible through
things like Google Earth.

00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:52.900
So we've got Saroo here today.

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:55.790
I've got some questions
here for Saroo and ones

00:03:55.790 --> 00:03:58.660
that we have collected from the
Dory that was open yesterday

00:03:58.660 --> 00:03:59.479
and earlier today.

00:03:59.479 --> 00:04:01.270
And also later on we're
going to open it up

00:04:01.270 --> 00:04:02.478
for questions from the floor.

00:04:02.478 --> 00:04:05.960
So please, have your questions
ready for Saroo as well.

00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:07.450
So welcome, Saroo.

00:04:07.450 --> 00:04:10.210
And just to start, we
saw the trailer just now.

00:04:10.210 --> 00:04:12.700
But maybe you'd like to
give everybody, especially

00:04:12.700 --> 00:04:15.040
those people who
haven't seen the movie,

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:18.727
a bit more of an
explanation of your story.

00:04:18.727 --> 00:04:20.560
SAROO BRIERLEY: Yeah,
that was really quick,

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:24.610
but it's a 10-hour story that's
been compressed into two hours.

00:04:24.610 --> 00:04:27.220
And now it's probably even more.

00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:30.610
But I lived in the
slum suburb of India.

00:04:30.610 --> 00:04:32.080
This is 29 years ago.

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:33.970
And I was only about
five years of age

00:04:33.970 --> 00:04:36.370
and stood over about
a meter in height.

00:04:36.370 --> 00:04:40.040
And one night, I went with
my brother from my hometown

00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:43.510
and caught a train to
our local neighboring

00:04:43.510 --> 00:04:46.960
station, which was a couple
of hours, just down the road.

00:04:50.220 --> 00:04:54.115
And so we got there
about 9, 8 o'clock--

00:04:54.115 --> 00:04:57.220
sorry, 8 or 9 o'clock.

00:04:57.220 --> 00:05:00.460
And I was quite tired
and weary and sleepy.

00:05:00.460 --> 00:05:02.990
I'm only five years of age.

00:05:02.990 --> 00:05:04.880
And it's past my bedtime.

00:05:04.880 --> 00:05:07.300
And so I grabbed
my brother's hand.

00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:10.430
And we stepped off the train
and onto the station platform

00:05:10.430 --> 00:05:12.880
and I saw a chair
in front of me.

00:05:12.880 --> 00:05:15.880
And so I pulled my
brother towards it.

00:05:15.880 --> 00:05:18.730
And my feet are doing the
talking, as they sort of do it

00:05:18.730 --> 00:05:19.950
when you're tired.

00:05:19.950 --> 00:05:21.280
And I sat down.

00:05:21.280 --> 00:05:23.170
And my brother said,
stay here for a minute.

00:05:23.170 --> 00:05:25.300
I'll come back to get you.

00:05:25.300 --> 00:05:27.836
I went to sleep.

00:05:27.836 --> 00:05:29.710
And when I wake up, not
knowing whether I was

00:05:29.710 --> 00:05:33.200
sleep for two hours,
three hours, or more--

00:05:33.200 --> 00:05:36.700
but when I woke up, my brother
was nowhere to be seen.

00:05:36.700 --> 00:05:41.380
And so I thought, he's on
the train that is standing.

00:05:41.380 --> 00:05:43.060
Whether it's the
same one that I came

00:05:43.060 --> 00:05:46.930
from my hometown or a different
one, I wasn't sure of.

00:05:46.930 --> 00:05:51.130
But I made that
impulse decision--

00:05:51.130 --> 00:05:55.430
groggy impulse decision-- to
board the train thinking he's

00:05:55.430 --> 00:05:55.930
on there.

00:05:55.930 --> 00:05:58.840
So I boarded it, went
to sleep in a cubicle,

00:05:58.840 --> 00:06:03.160
not knowing that I'm
going on a train that

00:06:03.160 --> 00:06:04.900
has a destination unknown.

00:06:04.900 --> 00:06:11.260
So I ended up 32 hours, 1,600
kilometers from the safe zone

00:06:11.260 --> 00:06:15.010
to a place called Kolkata, where
I survived for months, going

00:06:15.010 --> 00:06:20.620
through trials and tribulations
of some of the things of come

00:06:20.620 --> 00:06:25.040
across people that said that
they'd help me try and find

00:06:25.040 --> 00:06:27.566
my hometown, but they
had an ulterior motive,

00:06:27.566 --> 00:06:28.940
and then running
away from there,

00:06:28.940 --> 00:06:32.540
and then almost drowning
in the Hooghly River twice,

00:06:32.540 --> 00:06:36.610
then to coming across
boy gangs, and then going

00:06:36.610 --> 00:06:40.240
to a local prison, to a juvenile
prison, to adoption home.

00:06:40.240 --> 00:06:43.930
And then from there being
adopted out to Australia,

00:06:43.930 --> 00:06:47.530
Tasmania, where I
always looked after,

00:06:47.530 --> 00:06:53.020
loved, shown the Australian way
of life the culture, and so on.

00:06:53.020 --> 00:06:57.970
But always had that nostalgia
of being reminiscing of my past

00:06:57.970 --> 00:07:01.870
and what an oddity it has
been for such a long time

00:07:01.870 --> 00:07:04.900
that I couldn't conceive
how a child could

00:07:04.900 --> 00:07:08.980
get from being with his
family to getting on a train

00:07:08.980 --> 00:07:10.267
and getting lost.

00:07:10.267 --> 00:07:11.350
It just didn't make sense.

00:07:11.350 --> 00:07:14.800
Even though it was
saddening, I had

00:07:14.800 --> 00:07:20.440
to find the closure of at
least giving a valiant attempt

00:07:20.440 --> 00:07:23.920
in trying to find my family,
whichever ways in the means

00:07:23.920 --> 00:07:25.640
that I've got at hand.

00:07:25.640 --> 00:07:29.740
And so in my latter 20s,
I found Google Earth.

00:07:29.740 --> 00:07:36.730
And I had that option of
looking on an atlas of trying

00:07:36.730 --> 00:07:40.630
to find Burhanpur, which is
the only name that I remembered

00:07:40.630 --> 00:07:42.650
in the way that articulated.

00:07:42.650 --> 00:07:45.430
But I had a really
good visual memory.

00:07:45.430 --> 00:07:49.490
And I thought, you know, if
there's such an application

00:07:49.490 --> 00:07:54.460
that I could use on the
internet that I could match

00:07:54.460 --> 00:07:58.060
what's in my memories-- of the
landmarks and the architecture

00:07:58.060 --> 00:07:59.750
of my hometown--

00:07:59.750 --> 00:08:04.970
to what I can see on cyberspace,
Google Earth, then it

00:08:04.970 --> 00:08:07.220
would make the process so
much quicker, as opposed

00:08:07.220 --> 00:08:12.170
to going back to India and
trying to find Burhanpur

00:08:12.170 --> 00:08:16.500
and a train station that maybe
looks the same, maybe not.

00:08:16.500 --> 00:08:19.070
So I went onto Google Earth.

00:08:19.070 --> 00:08:21.170
And for years and
years, I searched,

00:08:21.170 --> 00:08:25.190
from going haphazardly to
becoming quite methodical

00:08:25.190 --> 00:08:27.290
and strategic in the
ways that I thought

00:08:27.290 --> 00:08:30.860
about looking for my hometown.

00:08:30.860 --> 00:08:35.539
And in 2011, I found that
needle in a haystack.

00:08:35.539 --> 00:08:40.549
And in 2012, I found my
hometown, as well as my family

00:08:40.549 --> 00:08:42.690
as well.

00:08:42.690 --> 00:08:48.110
So that was a quick version.

00:08:48.110 --> 00:08:50.642
Even though we could
have 20 coffees and I'd

00:08:50.642 --> 00:08:52.100
tell you the 10-hour
version, which

00:08:52.100 --> 00:08:56.940
I'm happy to do so, because
I don't mind it myself.

00:08:56.940 --> 00:09:02.230
But yeah, it pretty
much happened like that.

00:09:02.230 --> 00:09:08.030
But I listened to myself,
my dreams, my gut feelings,

00:09:08.030 --> 00:09:10.430
and my memories as well.

00:09:10.430 --> 00:09:14.660
And the hope and determination--

00:09:14.660 --> 00:09:16.060
I was harnessed with that.

00:09:16.060 --> 00:09:19.310
So I think that
those points were

00:09:19.310 --> 00:09:21.770
quite integral to
finding what I've been

00:09:21.770 --> 00:09:23.429
longing for such a long time.

00:09:23.429 --> 00:09:25.220
CASEY WHITELAW: It's
such an amazing story.

00:09:25.220 --> 00:09:27.790
Even your compressed
version like this

00:09:27.790 --> 00:09:30.500
is just so inspirational.

00:09:30.500 --> 00:09:32.930
The movie has been a
huge success worldwide.

00:09:32.930 --> 00:09:34.600
What do you think about it?

00:09:34.600 --> 00:09:36.350
What do you think there
is about it that's

00:09:36.350 --> 00:09:40.057
been so universally acclaimed?

00:09:40.057 --> 00:09:42.390
SAROO BRIERLEY: There's so
many attributes to the movie.

00:09:42.390 --> 00:09:44.900
And people see it in
so many different ways.

00:09:44.900 --> 00:09:48.980
It resonates in people in
so many different ways.

00:09:48.980 --> 00:09:56.060
I guess political to
scientific to a movement

00:09:56.060 --> 00:09:59.810
in the community in
regards to adoption,

00:09:59.810 --> 00:10:05.840
from having IVF to having
that option of adopting

00:10:05.840 --> 00:10:10.430
as well for couples that
want to have children.

00:10:10.430 --> 00:10:15.350
So that is some of the
things, but people just

00:10:15.350 --> 00:10:19.320
see it in different ways,
from hope and determination.

00:10:19.320 --> 00:10:28.430
And I guess that's mainly the
things that I get talked about,

00:10:28.430 --> 00:10:29.420
is adoption.

00:10:29.420 --> 00:10:33.350
But other people see it
in other ways, as well.

00:10:33.350 --> 00:10:37.494
Do you think nurture or
nature kind of thing,

00:10:37.494 --> 00:10:39.410
in regards to when we're
bringing up children.

00:10:45.345 --> 00:10:46.850
I guess there's so many things.

00:10:46.850 --> 00:10:47.810
Where do you start?

00:10:47.810 --> 00:10:49.310
CASEY WHITELAW: I
wasn't joking when

00:10:49.310 --> 00:10:50.450
I was saying that
watching the trailer

00:10:50.450 --> 00:10:51.740
there was tearing me up.

00:10:51.740 --> 00:10:53.150
I have a young son.

00:10:53.150 --> 00:10:55.550
And I found the
beginning of that film--

00:10:55.550 --> 00:10:56.656
who's seen "Lion"?

00:10:56.656 --> 00:10:58.155
I don't know if
anyone could-- yeah.

00:10:58.155 --> 00:10:59.210
Oh, fabulous.

00:10:59.210 --> 00:10:59.780
That's great.

00:10:59.780 --> 00:11:00.280
Look.

00:11:00.280 --> 00:11:02.439
SAROO BRIERLEY:
Everyone at Google.

00:11:02.439 --> 00:11:03.980
CASEY WHITELAW:
Watching those scenes

00:11:03.980 --> 00:11:05.605
where you're lost on
the train and then

00:11:05.605 --> 00:11:07.820
surviving in Kolkata
were just heartbreaking.

00:11:07.820 --> 00:11:09.896
With my own young
son in particular,

00:11:09.896 --> 00:11:11.270
I just couldn't
think of anything

00:11:11.270 --> 00:11:15.109
that was more directly
tugging on my heartstrings

00:11:15.109 --> 00:11:16.650
than seeing somebody
go through that.

00:11:16.650 --> 00:11:18.950
So I think that is really
something very universal,

00:11:18.950 --> 00:11:22.240
even on that quest also to
try and find your family.

00:11:22.240 --> 00:11:23.450
SAROO BRIERLEY: Yeah.

00:11:23.450 --> 00:11:25.490
I guess that particular scene--

00:11:28.170 --> 00:11:31.370
you've got to be a fighter.

00:11:31.370 --> 00:11:37.760
And to survive, you've got to
fight, day by day, to live.

00:11:37.760 --> 00:11:41.780
And it shocks people when they
see a scene like, I guess.

00:11:41.780 --> 00:11:44.570
And it's, we live in
such a lucky world--

00:11:44.570 --> 00:11:46.260
and a country as well--

00:11:46.260 --> 00:11:50.300
that we're not open to what
I went through and seeing

00:11:50.300 --> 00:11:51.930
that kind of scenery.

00:11:51.930 --> 00:11:55.550
So it affects people
to depths where

00:11:55.550 --> 00:11:58.250
they've never really gone to.

00:11:58.250 --> 00:12:01.730
And I guess probably the
whole film does that, really.

00:12:01.730 --> 00:12:05.600
But more particularly,
specifically that scene

00:12:05.600 --> 00:12:11.260
in Kolkata, which could have
been lengthened as well,

00:12:11.260 --> 00:12:13.850
but you saw a glimpse of
what it's actually like.

00:12:13.850 --> 00:12:14.650
CASEY WHITELAW: Thank
you for not making

00:12:14.650 --> 00:12:15.767
it even more [INAUDIBLE].

00:12:15.767 --> 00:12:18.202
[LAUGHTER]

00:12:20.150 --> 00:12:23.480
So one part of the film in
particular I wanted to dig into

00:12:23.480 --> 00:12:26.790
was the search, so
from when you started

00:12:26.790 --> 00:12:29.900
thinking that you really
wanted to find your hometown

00:12:29.900 --> 00:12:32.090
and using technology to do so.

00:12:32.090 --> 00:12:34.510
I'd love to know more
about your process.

00:12:34.510 --> 00:12:36.129
We saw some of this in the film.

00:12:36.129 --> 00:12:38.420
And I don't know how accurately
that's representing it.

00:12:38.420 --> 00:12:42.170
We had maps and these
search radii and so forth.

00:12:42.170 --> 00:12:44.870
Can you tell us what was
your mindset going in?

00:12:44.870 --> 00:12:46.730
And then what did you do?

00:12:46.730 --> 00:12:49.850
How did that search work?

00:12:49.850 --> 00:12:54.990
SAROO BRIERLEY: Well initially,
I thought, you've got YouTube

00:12:54.990 --> 00:12:57.640
and you've got access
to information,

00:12:57.640 --> 00:12:59.950
as opposed to going
to the library.

00:12:59.950 --> 00:13:02.680
And if you wanted
to play the guitar,

00:13:02.680 --> 00:13:05.500
why pay a tuition when
you can go onto YouTube

00:13:05.500 --> 00:13:06.990
and learn yourself?

00:13:06.990 --> 00:13:09.700
And so it started from there.

00:13:09.700 --> 00:13:12.100
And I thought, you know,
the internet has got so much

00:13:12.100 --> 00:13:14.580
information-- and one
of it's Google Earth--

00:13:14.580 --> 00:13:20.810
that I could use this
application, as opposed

00:13:20.810 --> 00:13:23.240
to going to India
and paying thousands

00:13:23.240 --> 00:13:28.620
and thousands of dollars and
maybe getting nowhere, ever.

00:13:28.620 --> 00:13:33.260
And so when Google Earth
came about, I thought--

00:13:33.260 --> 00:13:36.440
not knowing what I'm really
getting into, because once I

00:13:36.440 --> 00:13:42.020
started using it, I became
quite obsessed and regimented--

00:13:42.020 --> 00:13:45.775
finishing work,
coming home at 5:30,

00:13:45.775 --> 00:13:47.900
putting the laptop, which
my girlfriend at the time

00:13:47.900 --> 00:13:51.800
called it a fat top,
because I sat on the couch

00:13:51.800 --> 00:13:54.610
and there it was.

00:13:54.610 --> 00:13:55.630
Dinner wasn't cooked.

00:13:55.630 --> 00:13:56.460
Nothing.

00:13:56.460 --> 00:14:00.860
So until midnight and
early hours of the mornings

00:14:00.860 --> 00:14:05.420
as well till 5 o'clock,
6 o'clock in the morning,

00:14:05.420 --> 00:14:08.210
and then forget to go to work,
even though it was my family

00:14:08.210 --> 00:14:10.350
business, and arrive late--

00:14:10.350 --> 00:14:12.500
5:00 to 5:00, which 5
o'clock was finishing time.

00:14:15.040 --> 00:14:20.390
And so you became
quite obsessed and not

00:14:20.390 --> 00:14:24.720
realizing that you're
shutting the world away

00:14:24.720 --> 00:14:28.570
and concentrating in trying to
find something that you've been

00:14:28.570 --> 00:14:30.460
longing for such a long time.

00:14:30.460 --> 00:14:36.210
And so from being haphazardly
looking to becoming methodical,

00:14:36.210 --> 00:14:39.740
it's like well, you've got to
take things a step at a time.

00:14:39.740 --> 00:14:42.770
You've got to use what you know,
and not what you don't know.

00:14:42.770 --> 00:14:48.440
And so I knew that the
trains went at around 70,

00:14:48.440 --> 00:14:51.470
60 kilometers an hour, roughly.

00:14:51.470 --> 00:14:54.560
And then I had a
rough guesstimate

00:14:54.560 --> 00:14:57.860
that I was on the train for
about 12 hours, but knowing now

00:14:57.860 --> 00:14:59.360
it was 32 hours.

00:14:59.360 --> 00:15:02.990
So I didn't really
have a lot to go on.

00:15:02.990 --> 00:15:05.930
But at least I had
something to start,

00:15:05.930 --> 00:15:07.830
which is better than nothing.

00:15:07.830 --> 00:15:12.970
And so that's the way the
radius line sort of came about.

00:15:12.970 --> 00:15:16.940
It's like you know point B,
but you don't know point A.

00:15:16.940 --> 00:15:20.370
And I ended up in
Kolkata, as we all know.

00:15:20.370 --> 00:15:22.280
And so perhaps this
radius line can

00:15:22.280 --> 00:15:25.670
help in creating a
search conference.

00:15:25.670 --> 00:15:30.890
And so I put a line
out from Kolkata,

00:15:30.890 --> 00:15:32.930
right down from north to south.

00:15:32.930 --> 00:15:35.840
And that created
that hemisphere.

00:15:35.840 --> 00:15:39.040
And I knew that
the hometown's not

00:15:39.040 --> 00:15:41.150
going to be straight on
the radius line there,

00:15:41.150 --> 00:15:44.270
but it's going to be
in and out, roughly.

00:15:44.270 --> 00:15:46.340
So that gave a
bit of a guidance.

00:15:46.340 --> 00:15:48.270
And so you segregated
the north of India,

00:15:48.270 --> 00:15:49.520
segregated the south of India.

00:15:52.760 --> 00:15:56.330
And you were left with
this rectangular piece

00:15:56.330 --> 00:16:00.830
of after years and years of
searching, and pushing things

00:16:00.830 --> 00:16:04.860
apart, that this is
all you're left with.

00:16:04.860 --> 00:16:07.610
And that radius line
was almost telling you

00:16:07.610 --> 00:16:10.100
that this is where
you should be looking

00:16:10.100 --> 00:16:14.150
after segregating those two
points, north and south.

00:16:14.150 --> 00:16:20.690
And calling it providence
or serendipity, I ended up--

00:16:20.690 --> 00:16:24.680
not that I ever conceived that
I could possibly believe--

00:16:24.680 --> 00:16:29.240
you could have ended up from the
west side of India to the east.

00:16:29.240 --> 00:16:31.850
But let's not have
any stones unturned

00:16:31.850 --> 00:16:36.020
and take a shot at looking
at the west side of India.

00:16:36.020 --> 00:16:37.100
Hence, I did.

00:16:37.100 --> 00:16:41.030
And I found that needle in a
haystack, which a lot of people

00:16:41.030 --> 00:16:46.130
thought I couldn't, in
2011, at around 2 o'clock

00:16:46.130 --> 00:16:48.422
in the morning.

00:16:48.422 --> 00:16:53.270
So back when I was a
teenager, I thought to myself,

00:16:53.270 --> 00:16:57.770
in the latter teens, that
atlas is no good for me.

00:16:57.770 --> 00:17:01.430
But I hope one day that
there would be a program--

00:17:01.430 --> 00:17:04.640
not knowing that it's embryonic
at that point of time.

00:17:04.640 --> 00:17:10.484
And then, in 2005-2006, it
was there, the application

00:17:10.484 --> 00:17:11.150
of Google Earth.

00:17:11.150 --> 00:17:13.230
Even though I thought
about it back then,

00:17:13.230 --> 00:17:17.609
it became apparent in reality
in 2006, when I used it.

00:17:17.609 --> 00:17:22.565
And so Google Earth is the
catalyst of finding my family.

00:17:22.565 --> 00:17:24.440
And I'm sure there are
other people out there

00:17:24.440 --> 00:17:27.720
in the world too that
have used the program

00:17:27.720 --> 00:17:30.475
to find what they've longing
for such a long time.

00:17:30.475 --> 00:17:31.850
CASEY WHITELAW:
For most of us, I

00:17:31.850 --> 00:17:33.810
think it's usually our rooftop.

00:17:33.810 --> 00:17:37.102
You know, we take it for
granted when we start out.

00:17:37.102 --> 00:17:39.560
The first thing that everybody
does-- and it turns out this

00:17:39.560 --> 00:17:41.606
is universal, and the
first thing everybody does.

00:17:41.606 --> 00:17:42.980
We thought that
what they'd do is

00:17:42.980 --> 00:17:44.960
go visit the Grand Canyon
or the Eiffel Tower

00:17:44.960 --> 00:17:45.990
or something like that.

00:17:45.990 --> 00:17:47.780
But in truth, everybody
types in their home address.

00:17:47.780 --> 00:17:48.420
SAROO BRIERLEY: Yeah,
see if it's there.

00:17:48.420 --> 00:17:50.336
CASEY WHITELAW: Goes to
look at it-- yep, yep,

00:17:50.336 --> 00:17:51.350
that is indeed my house.

00:17:51.350 --> 00:17:52.790
[LAUGHTER]

00:17:52.790 --> 00:17:53.492
The same way.

00:17:53.492 --> 00:17:54.950
And in some ways,
that was actually

00:17:54.950 --> 00:17:56.130
exactly what you were doing.

00:17:56.130 --> 00:17:57.505
SAROO BRIERLEY:
Well I did, yeah.

00:17:57.505 --> 00:17:59.650
It was exactly the
thing that I did.

00:17:59.650 --> 00:18:03.585
I actually saw my mum
watering the garden.

00:18:03.585 --> 00:18:05.044
But you guys took her photo.

00:18:05.044 --> 00:18:06.460
CASEY WHITELAW:
In Tasi, you mean?

00:18:06.460 --> 00:18:06.890
SAROO BRIERLEY: Yeah.

00:18:06.890 --> 00:18:07.670
CASEY WHITELAW: Yeah.

00:18:07.670 --> 00:18:09.628
SAROO BRIERLEY: Did you
know that it was there,

00:18:09.628 --> 00:18:11.000
watering the garden?

00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:12.080
CASEY WHITELAW: But
you had somewhere else

00:18:12.080 --> 00:18:13.730
to find that was a
lot harder for you

00:18:13.730 --> 00:18:14.900
to find than that, as well.

00:18:14.900 --> 00:18:16.983
SAROO BRIERLEY: Yeah, but
it was a starting point.

00:18:16.983 --> 00:18:22.735
And it wasn't as easy as
just getting on Google Earth

00:18:22.735 --> 00:18:23.610
and doing what I did.

00:18:23.610 --> 00:18:27.300
You had to arm yourself
with information.

00:18:27.300 --> 00:18:31.280
And mum and dad were a
major part of my life.

00:18:31.280 --> 00:18:36.180
They fortified with their
knowledge within me,

00:18:36.180 --> 00:18:38.790
really, of my
understanding and so on.

00:18:38.790 --> 00:18:42.090
But there was other
parts to myself too,

00:18:42.090 --> 00:18:47.370
to having that sort of a
nurturing and push in wanting

00:18:47.370 --> 00:18:50.600
to also keep going, as well.

00:18:50.600 --> 00:18:53.820
Because a lot of
people can become--

00:18:53.820 --> 00:18:56.370
this is just a waste of time.

00:18:56.370 --> 00:18:57.665
It's so futile.

00:18:57.665 --> 00:18:59.140
And let's give up.

00:18:59.140 --> 00:19:01.680
CASEY WHITELAW: You said
it was five years from when

00:19:01.680 --> 00:19:04.740
you started using Earth
to try and find it,

00:19:04.740 --> 00:19:07.170
until 2011, when you did?

00:19:07.170 --> 00:19:08.430
SAROO BRIERLEY: Yes.

00:19:08.430 --> 00:19:10.670
CASEY WHITELAW: How do
you keep going five years?

00:19:10.670 --> 00:19:12.920
SAROO BRIERLEY: I don't tell
a lot of people about it.

00:19:15.060 --> 00:19:17.820
There's two things to it.

00:19:17.820 --> 00:19:20.550
The first was
astral projections.

00:19:20.550 --> 00:19:23.100
And a lot of people would
find it really hard,

00:19:23.100 --> 00:19:24.990
and years and
years, to ever come

00:19:24.990 --> 00:19:26.906
to that point of
astral projection.

00:19:26.906 --> 00:19:28.530
And astral projection
is where you have

00:19:28.530 --> 00:19:30.150
that out-of-body experience.

00:19:30.150 --> 00:19:35.100
And I had astral projections
when I came to Australia--

00:19:35.100 --> 00:19:40.440
always had the out-of-body
experience of going to sleep.

00:19:40.440 --> 00:19:44.760
Hence why I wake up in the
morning abed with a sore head,

00:19:44.760 --> 00:19:46.830
because I never really slept.

00:19:46.830 --> 00:19:49.110
I had this thing in my
subconscious going on.

00:19:49.110 --> 00:19:51.680
And going into astral projection
of going out of the body,

00:19:51.680 --> 00:19:55.860
into space, and
then materializing

00:19:55.860 --> 00:19:59.220
at the door of my house,
where I was born, and going in

00:19:59.220 --> 00:20:03.350
and hovering over my family
to tell them that I'm OK,

00:20:03.350 --> 00:20:06.870
and one day I'll see you.

00:20:06.870 --> 00:20:10.542
So you know there was that, in
the recurring dreams and so on.

00:20:10.542 --> 00:20:12.000
I didn't really
know what it meant.

00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:13.200
I really didn't tell people.

00:20:13.200 --> 00:20:17.190
I didn't tell my
parents, until later on.

00:20:17.190 --> 00:20:20.329
But the other
integral part, too,

00:20:20.329 --> 00:20:21.870
which I don't really
tell many people

00:20:21.870 --> 00:20:25.350
about as well, because
I just don't know

00:20:25.350 --> 00:20:27.450
how they'd understand it much--

00:20:27.450 --> 00:20:32.290
but having people that
are ancient philosophers

00:20:32.290 --> 00:20:38.680
and mathematicians, like
Isaac Newton and Nikola Tesla

00:20:38.680 --> 00:20:41.310
and Pythagoras and
all these people--

00:20:41.310 --> 00:20:43.950
these people have left
a legacy on this Earth.

00:20:43.950 --> 00:20:45.450
And I've always
looked towards them,

00:20:45.450 --> 00:20:51.600
as in you guys have autonomously
transcended in finding things,

00:20:51.600 --> 00:20:54.542
as well as Martin Luther King.

00:20:54.542 --> 00:20:55.500
These are great people.

00:20:55.500 --> 00:20:59.160
And I thought, I hope I could
be like you guys one day, too,

00:20:59.160 --> 00:21:03.450
of trying to fulfill something
that I've been wanting

00:21:03.450 --> 00:21:05.920
for such a long time.

00:21:05.920 --> 00:21:08.640
And I read about
them, and so on.

00:21:08.640 --> 00:21:10.770
And they're a real
inspiration to me.

00:21:10.770 --> 00:21:15.720
Because when you have Kanye
West and Nikola Tesla--

00:21:15.720 --> 00:21:18.360
everyone knows who's Kanye
West, but no one would really

00:21:18.360 --> 00:21:19.777
know who this other person is.

00:21:19.777 --> 00:21:22.110
CASEY WHITELAW: Tesla was
actually a pretty good rapper.

00:21:22.110 --> 00:21:23.235
SAROO BRIERLEY: Oh, was he?

00:21:23.235 --> 00:21:25.540
[LAUGHTER]

00:21:25.540 --> 00:21:28.800
Oh, no, really?

00:21:28.800 --> 00:21:33.390
But yeah, he was a
great philosopher too.

00:21:33.390 --> 00:21:38.730
But yeah, these people
were quite integral part

00:21:38.730 --> 00:21:43.380
of my life too, that
they helped in making

00:21:43.380 --> 00:21:44.460
me want to keep going.

00:21:44.460 --> 00:21:46.140
Because they didn't stop.

00:21:46.140 --> 00:21:47.670
They kept on going.

00:21:47.670 --> 00:21:51.390
And not having much help
from other people, too--

00:21:51.390 --> 00:21:53.670
they autonomously tried.

00:21:53.670 --> 00:21:56.930
CASEY WHITELAW: And so for
you was it autonomous as well?

00:21:56.930 --> 00:22:01.080
Hearing about this amazing
internal drive that you had,

00:22:01.080 --> 00:22:03.340
did anybody else help
you through this?

00:22:03.340 --> 00:22:06.453
Did you get friends to
look on Earth as well?

00:22:06.453 --> 00:22:07.277
Was it just you?

00:22:07.277 --> 00:22:08.985
SAROO BRIERLEY: No,
it was all by myself.

00:22:08.985 --> 00:22:10.776
I didn't want to tell
many people about it.

00:22:10.776 --> 00:22:16.380
Because I thought by telling
people, even to my parents,

00:22:16.380 --> 00:22:18.270
they would slow me down.

00:22:18.270 --> 00:22:22.430
And I would go through the
phasing stage and the steps

00:22:22.430 --> 00:22:24.180
that I need to go,
even though sometimes I

00:22:24.180 --> 00:22:28.290
may be veering away, but
it's all a learning curve.

00:22:28.290 --> 00:22:29.320
If I make a mistake--

00:22:29.320 --> 00:22:30.530
well, I've learned something.

00:22:30.530 --> 00:22:33.870
Then I can realign myself
and go in the directions

00:22:33.870 --> 00:22:34.890
that I need to.

00:22:34.890 --> 00:22:38.460
So I thought that by telling
people, that would slow me down

00:22:38.460 --> 00:22:41.040
by Saroo, look, that's the past.

00:22:41.040 --> 00:22:41.630
This is now.

00:22:41.630 --> 00:22:42.930
And that's the future.

00:22:42.930 --> 00:22:46.140
Forget about the past.

00:22:46.140 --> 00:22:48.315
You're in a lucky place
with a great family.

00:22:52.550 --> 00:22:56.640
I think your past is
really putting you down

00:22:56.640 --> 00:23:00.130
into progressing in your life.

00:23:00.130 --> 00:23:03.870
And if I had listened to them,
even though they were just

00:23:03.870 --> 00:23:07.470
trying to look after
me as friends would,

00:23:07.470 --> 00:23:12.150
maybe I won't be here and this
story would never come about.

00:23:12.150 --> 00:23:15.130
But I didn't want to listen.

00:23:15.130 --> 00:23:16.950
I wanted to do
something that I wanted

00:23:16.950 --> 00:23:20.270
to do, think outside the
square that you're living

00:23:20.270 --> 00:23:23.572
and listen to your mind
and your gut feelings

00:23:23.572 --> 00:23:24.780
and what they're telling you.

00:23:28.500 --> 00:23:31.730
So yeah, it's one
of those things

00:23:31.730 --> 00:23:37.220
that you've got to
do yourself and not

00:23:37.220 --> 00:23:40.430
other people have
your influence.

00:23:40.430 --> 00:23:43.060
But it was a personal journey.

00:23:43.060 --> 00:23:47.840
A story like this, of my past,
you just don't tell to anyone.

00:23:47.840 --> 00:23:49.954
It's private.

00:23:49.954 --> 00:23:51.620
And I'm sure we all
have private stories

00:23:51.620 --> 00:23:55.974
that we don't want to tell
your best friend or your mum.

00:23:55.974 --> 00:23:59.130
And this was my
private story, that I

00:23:59.130 --> 00:24:00.920
wanted to do things
myself, and I

00:24:00.920 --> 00:24:04.550
didn't want to shoot
too far ahead of myself.

00:24:04.550 --> 00:24:07.394
It's like, hey, I'm
using Google Earth.

00:24:07.394 --> 00:24:09.560
People would come up and
say, why don't you do this?

00:24:09.560 --> 00:24:10.880
Why don't you do that?

00:24:10.880 --> 00:24:13.430
And it becomes very cluttered.

00:24:13.430 --> 00:24:16.200
And you've got to defragment--

00:24:16.200 --> 00:24:19.230
you're trying to defragment
itself, let alone have

00:24:19.230 --> 00:24:22.660
other people's problems
coming in and influences.

00:24:22.660 --> 00:24:27.860
I achieve better by
myself, acquiring knowledge

00:24:27.860 --> 00:24:30.830
from other people, but
not have other people

00:24:30.830 --> 00:24:33.590
invest themselves helping.

00:24:33.590 --> 00:24:36.530
CASEY WHITELAW: So you
were just five when you

00:24:36.530 --> 00:24:39.690
left your home on the train.

00:24:39.690 --> 00:24:42.080
What were the memories
that you took with you

00:24:42.080 --> 00:24:43.770
that you used later on?

00:24:43.770 --> 00:24:45.210
What were the
things that you were

00:24:45.210 --> 00:24:48.010
able to keep with you that
when you were doing your search

00:24:48.010 --> 00:24:50.376
helped you find your home?

00:24:50.376 --> 00:24:53.570
SAROO BRIERLEY: Well, the
bond between mother and son--

00:24:53.570 --> 00:24:55.460
and my siblings,
especially my sister--

00:24:58.670 --> 00:25:01.700
that was fused pretty well.

00:25:01.700 --> 00:25:07.670
I wasn't a child that was
taken and then let go of.

00:25:07.670 --> 00:25:09.200
I was a lost child.

00:25:09.200 --> 00:25:11.797
Not that it was any
fault of my own.

00:25:11.797 --> 00:25:13.880
I suppose it would have
been a different situation

00:25:13.880 --> 00:25:16.970
if I had been handed
over and said,

00:25:16.970 --> 00:25:18.950
you're not wanted anymore.

00:25:18.950 --> 00:25:22.380
It would have been a
totally different story.

00:25:22.380 --> 00:25:27.580
But the yearning of wanting to
find my mother and especially

00:25:27.580 --> 00:25:32.720
my sister, as well,
because I was her carer.

00:25:32.720 --> 00:25:36.410
There was a major drive, as
in when it comes to family,

00:25:36.410 --> 00:25:39.320
no one would ever
let go of family.

00:25:39.320 --> 00:25:41.990
And I didn't want to be
disrespectful to my adoptive

00:25:41.990 --> 00:25:44.150
family, but in my latter age--

00:25:44.150 --> 00:25:46.040
I'm coming up to 30.

00:25:46.040 --> 00:25:53.180
I'm an adult. I didn't tell
them about my searching

00:25:53.180 --> 00:25:58.950
until later on I achieved
what I wanted to achieve.

00:25:58.950 --> 00:26:00.080
And then would have told--

00:26:00.080 --> 00:26:00.530
I did, actually.

00:26:00.530 --> 00:26:01.030
I told them.

00:26:01.030 --> 00:26:02.830
It's like I found hometown.

00:26:02.830 --> 00:26:07.464
Is it OK, with your
permission, that I go back.

00:26:07.464 --> 00:26:08.880
And they gave me
their permission,

00:26:08.880 --> 00:26:12.860
said, yes, we would too,
would want the same thing

00:26:12.860 --> 00:26:15.901
if we were in your position.

00:26:15.901 --> 00:26:22.580
So it was all to do with family,
really, and not to give up,

00:26:22.580 --> 00:26:25.580
as well as to diffuse those
weights on my shoulders that

00:26:25.580 --> 00:26:27.470
had been there for
such a long time, which

00:26:27.470 --> 00:26:31.500
was driven from
wanting to find out

00:26:31.500 --> 00:26:35.570
that my mother's OK she's still
alive, and my sister as well.

00:26:35.570 --> 00:26:37.640
She was so tiny, so little--

00:26:37.640 --> 00:26:39.900
to wash her fingers
and her feet,

00:26:39.900 --> 00:26:43.280
because they were so muddy,
and she was eating charcoal,

00:26:43.280 --> 00:26:44.930
because there was no food.

00:26:44.930 --> 00:26:47.780
I couldn't provide anything.

00:26:47.780 --> 00:26:52.760
Just thinking about it would
just put tears to your eyes.

00:26:52.760 --> 00:26:56.410
CASEY WHITELAW: So when you did
find your hometown on Google

00:26:56.410 --> 00:26:58.450
Earth, how recognizable was it?

00:26:58.450 --> 00:27:00.920
Because the imagery,
presumably, was

00:27:00.920 --> 00:27:04.450
a lot different from
when you had left,

00:27:04.450 --> 00:27:07.430
and your memories of it
from when you had left.

00:27:07.430 --> 00:27:10.040
How did you really know that
you had found the right place?

00:27:14.050 --> 00:27:17.130
SAROO BRIERLEY: I'm a great
person with convincing myself

00:27:17.130 --> 00:27:19.410
with three things.

00:27:19.410 --> 00:27:22.950
So when I saw it for the first
time, in the subconscious,

00:27:22.950 --> 00:27:24.440
I know it's the place.

00:27:24.440 --> 00:27:30.450
But I also wanted to see it
from a video, which was YouTube.

00:27:30.450 --> 00:27:31.854
And so I just typed the name.

00:27:31.854 --> 00:27:33.270
And then, all of
the sudden, there

00:27:33.270 --> 00:27:35.710
was people going
through Khandwa,

00:27:35.710 --> 00:27:40.980
my hometown, camcording--
high-definition, too.

00:27:40.980 --> 00:27:44.010
And I was like, wow.

00:27:44.010 --> 00:27:46.350
You can't be any more convinced.

00:27:46.350 --> 00:27:50.530
And additionally to that,
I went onto Facebook

00:27:50.530 --> 00:27:51.750
and typed in Khandwa.

00:27:51.750 --> 00:27:59.520
And there was "Khandwa is
my Hometown" Facebook page.

00:27:59.520 --> 00:28:02.580
And I wrote to the administrator
asking all these questions.

00:28:02.580 --> 00:28:05.340
And he's coming back
with positive answers.

00:28:05.340 --> 00:28:08.310
So there was Google Earth.

00:28:08.310 --> 00:28:09.370
There was Facebook.

00:28:09.370 --> 00:28:11.280
There was YouTube.

00:28:11.280 --> 00:28:17.400
And that consolidated really
everything, as in even

00:28:17.400 --> 00:28:22.110
though I was feeling quite, no,
this not right, still, but hey.

00:28:22.110 --> 00:28:24.350
CASEY WHITELAW: I really
love hearing that it's--

00:28:24.350 --> 00:28:27.300
in the movie, it's all very
much about you matching up

00:28:27.300 --> 00:28:28.410
the imagery and so on.

00:28:28.410 --> 00:28:29.820
But the other
sources that you're

00:28:29.820 --> 00:28:32.220
talking about-- things like
YouTube, and Facebook-- just

00:28:32.220 --> 00:28:35.400
point to the way that the
internet has really transformed

00:28:35.400 --> 00:28:38.130
information these days.

00:28:38.130 --> 00:28:41.750
We have this expectation that
we can go on and find anything,

00:28:41.750 --> 00:28:44.860
as you said, about whether
it's a YouTube video

00:28:44.860 --> 00:28:47.520
to help you learn guitar
or somebody walking down

00:28:47.520 --> 00:28:50.920
the streets of your hometown
on the other side of the world,

00:28:50.920 --> 00:28:52.105
it's all out there.

00:28:52.105 --> 00:28:54.230
SAROO BRIERLEY: Yeah, well
I certainly embraced it.

00:28:59.820 --> 00:29:02.240
There wasn't any
other way, really.

00:29:02.240 --> 00:29:04.950
And imagine what the
Earth could be like

00:29:04.950 --> 00:29:07.190
if everyone else
thought like that too,

00:29:07.190 --> 00:29:12.870
of just using the internet in
whatever they wanted to find.

00:29:15.069 --> 00:29:16.860
CASEY WHITELAW: And to
understand something

00:29:16.860 --> 00:29:19.240
which is real different
from your own situation

00:29:19.240 --> 00:29:22.410
too, to see something that's
not just your hometown-- not

00:29:22.410 --> 00:29:24.569
your way you live yourself,
but something elsewhere

00:29:24.569 --> 00:29:25.110
in the world.

00:29:29.280 --> 00:29:33.530
Can you describe how it
felt when you got there

00:29:33.530 --> 00:29:36.240
and when you really knew
that you were there,

00:29:36.240 --> 00:29:38.490
standing in your home?

00:29:38.490 --> 00:29:40.380
I can't fathom what
that would feel like.

00:29:40.380 --> 00:29:42.129
I'd love to hear from you.

00:29:42.129 --> 00:29:43.920
SAROO BRIERLEY: It's
such a pivotal moment.

00:29:48.850 --> 00:29:50.380
I got to my hometown.

00:29:50.380 --> 00:29:55.170
I threw my bag in the
corner of the hotel.

00:29:55.170 --> 00:30:00.480
And I came to a
spot where I always

00:30:00.480 --> 00:30:04.920
went to, either going to the
city or going back to home.

00:30:04.920 --> 00:30:07.320
So it was a sort
of a central spot

00:30:07.320 --> 00:30:10.629
for everyone, really, going
to the city and suburbia.

00:30:10.629 --> 00:30:12.420
CASEY WHITELAW: And
this was in your memory

00:30:12.420 --> 00:30:13.590
from when you were five?

00:30:13.590 --> 00:30:13.975
SAROO BRIERLEY: Yeah.

00:30:13.975 --> 00:30:14.510
CASEY WHITELAW: You could--

00:30:14.510 --> 00:30:15.420
SAROO BRIERLEY: I pinpoint it.

00:30:15.420 --> 00:30:17.530
It's the landmark that
I would go all the time.

00:30:17.530 --> 00:30:19.560
And so as soon as I got
to this landmark, which

00:30:19.560 --> 00:30:27.780
is the bridge with a underpass,
my legs had muscle memory.

00:30:27.780 --> 00:30:29.750
And they just guided me.

00:30:29.750 --> 00:30:31.774
I'm looking around,
thinking, you know,

00:30:31.774 --> 00:30:33.190
this place looks
really different.

00:30:33.190 --> 00:30:35.850
But these legs knew everything.

00:30:35.850 --> 00:30:38.500
Amazing.

00:30:38.500 --> 00:30:44.400
And they were just taking
me to the door of my house,

00:30:44.400 --> 00:30:46.050
where I was born.

00:30:46.050 --> 00:30:47.920
And I'm trying to fight.

00:30:47.920 --> 00:30:50.630
I'm in a sort of a
state of indifference,

00:30:50.630 --> 00:30:53.400
as in, why does
everything look so small--

00:30:53.400 --> 00:30:56.520
and decayed, as well.

00:30:56.520 --> 00:30:58.470
And it's been 25 years.

00:30:58.470 --> 00:31:00.690
And things just
don't last forever.

00:31:00.690 --> 00:31:04.830
And houses have fallen
apart, crumbled.

00:31:04.830 --> 00:31:10.410
And new houses on top of the
old houses have been built upon.

00:31:10.410 --> 00:31:11.350
And things look small.

00:31:11.350 --> 00:31:14.630
It's because when you
were so short, or small,

00:31:14.630 --> 00:31:15.630
everything looks so big.

00:31:15.630 --> 00:31:20.450
But now you're so tall,
everything just looks so small.

00:31:20.450 --> 00:31:22.380
And so you were finding that.

00:31:22.380 --> 00:31:29.310
And it's like extrapolating and
trying to make sense of things.

00:31:29.310 --> 00:31:34.890
But when I got to the front
door, and it looked a bit--

00:31:34.890 --> 00:31:36.040
there's no one there.

00:31:36.040 --> 00:31:40.260
And the worst got into you
and thought, they're dead,

00:31:40.260 --> 00:31:44.100
or they moved somewhere else,
or they're not alive anymore.

00:31:44.100 --> 00:31:48.321
And then a few people came
along and asked questions

00:31:48.321 --> 00:31:50.070
about who are you, and
where are you from,

00:31:50.070 --> 00:31:52.660
and what you're doing, and
what you're looking for.

00:31:52.660 --> 00:31:56.250
And then that process of
telling them who I am,

00:31:56.250 --> 00:32:03.190
and where I'm from, and who
are my family members began.

00:32:03.190 --> 00:32:05.140
CASEY WHITELAW: Amazing.

00:32:05.140 --> 00:32:07.430
SAROO BRIERLEY: So
that point, where

00:32:07.430 --> 00:32:10.960
I was standing in front
of the door of my house,

00:32:10.960 --> 00:32:14.250
is the sign points
where I was before

00:32:14.250 --> 00:32:19.830
leaving to catch that train
25 years ago, to Burhanpur,

00:32:19.830 --> 00:32:23.430
before I went onto that
frightful noise to Kolkata.

00:32:23.430 --> 00:32:30.390
So there's a lot of recurrences.

00:32:30.390 --> 00:32:32.240
But this happened then.

00:32:32.240 --> 00:32:35.900
In 25 years, this happened
again at the same spot.

00:32:35.900 --> 00:32:40.120
So themes always
come in that I'm

00:32:40.120 --> 00:32:43.820
starting to realize from
an outsider looking in.

00:32:43.820 --> 00:32:45.880
Amazing.

00:32:45.880 --> 00:32:47.860
CASEY WHITELAW: I'd like
to switch now and ask

00:32:47.860 --> 00:32:51.120
you some questions from
Google here and also

00:32:51.120 --> 00:32:55.830
across Asia and the Pacific.

00:32:55.830 --> 00:32:57.150
So here's one.

00:32:57.150 --> 00:32:59.340
How has the technology
changed from when

00:32:59.340 --> 00:33:00.590
you were on your search?

00:33:00.590 --> 00:33:03.374
And do you think it would
be any easier for you today?

00:33:03.374 --> 00:33:04.260
[LAUGHS]

00:33:04.260 --> 00:33:06.640
SAROO BRIERLEY: Yes.

00:33:06.640 --> 00:33:09.479
The high definition, I guess.

00:33:09.479 --> 00:33:10.770
CASEY WHITELAW: Well plus the--

00:33:10.770 --> 00:33:12.500
SAROO BRIERLEY: In
regards to Google Earth?

00:33:12.500 --> 00:33:12.960
CASEY WHITELAW: The movie's out.

00:33:12.960 --> 00:33:15.085
You could just watch the
movie and you'd know.

00:33:15.085 --> 00:33:17.210
SAROO BRIERLEY: Well, that's
the other thing, yeah.

00:33:17.210 --> 00:33:19.430
I didn't think about that.

00:33:19.430 --> 00:33:21.010
But in regards
Google Earth, right?

00:33:21.010 --> 00:33:22.650
CASEY WHITELAW: Or
technology overall.

00:33:24.959 --> 00:33:27.500
SAROO BRIERLEY: Yeah, there's
just so much out there, really.

00:33:27.500 --> 00:33:29.530
Where do you start?

00:33:29.530 --> 00:33:32.250
But I think it's
up to the person,

00:33:32.250 --> 00:33:35.670
really, that wants to know.

00:33:35.670 --> 00:33:37.500
It's up to them to
press that button

00:33:37.500 --> 00:33:40.330
and want to search
for things and so on.

00:33:40.330 --> 00:33:42.450
It's at the touch of
our fingers, everything

00:33:42.450 --> 00:33:43.786
that we want.

00:33:43.786 --> 00:33:45.210
But it's really
up to you, really,

00:33:45.210 --> 00:33:54.069
if you want to venture into that
journey of expanding your mind.

00:33:54.069 --> 00:33:56.340
CASEY WHITELAW: Yeah.

00:33:56.340 --> 00:33:57.810
People in this
office are working

00:33:57.810 --> 00:34:00.224
on apps for what's described
as the next billion users.

00:34:00.224 --> 00:34:01.890
So this is people in
developing nations,

00:34:01.890 --> 00:34:04.550
such as India, who are starting
to access the internet,

00:34:04.550 --> 00:34:06.330
mostly on mobile phones.

00:34:06.330 --> 00:34:08.460
What services or
features do you think

00:34:08.460 --> 00:34:10.800
would be useful if you
were a young person living

00:34:10.800 --> 00:34:12.719
in India today?

00:34:12.719 --> 00:34:13.570
SAROO BRIERLEY: Woo.

00:34:13.570 --> 00:34:16.593
Gee, I love these
brainbusting questions.

00:34:19.980 --> 00:34:26.310
As a young person, there is such
a different degree from poverty

00:34:26.310 --> 00:34:31.050
to people in the
sectors of society.

00:34:31.050 --> 00:34:35.730
and their availability
to access even a phone,

00:34:35.730 --> 00:34:42.010
I guess, for starters, before
even going to applications.

00:34:42.010 --> 00:34:47.250
But cost is everything,
isn't it, these days?

00:34:47.250 --> 00:34:53.940
And the availability of
having that something that

00:34:53.940 --> 00:34:57.780
is cost effective and
attainable for a kid, I guess--

00:34:57.780 --> 00:34:59.270
it is a big question.

00:34:59.270 --> 00:35:07.350
So if was in the situation,
as my nieces and nephews are,

00:35:07.350 --> 00:35:08.950
I guess I'm not too sure.

00:35:08.950 --> 00:35:11.820
Just it would be a cost factor.

00:35:11.820 --> 00:35:13.514
Because not everyone
can afford it.

00:35:13.514 --> 00:35:15.180
CASEY WHITELAW: Have
you spent much time

00:35:15.180 --> 00:35:18.330
back there since you've
found your original family?

00:35:18.330 --> 00:35:20.770
SAROO BRIERLEY: 15 times I've
been back within the four

00:35:20.770 --> 00:35:22.680
years, which has been great.

00:35:22.680 --> 00:35:26.530
Because the Big 10
event in Delhi--

00:35:26.530 --> 00:35:29.760
and I went back to
do a talk there,

00:35:29.760 --> 00:35:31.890
which allowed me to
go and see my family.

00:35:31.890 --> 00:35:35.340
And then also with the book,
going back and retracing

00:35:35.340 --> 00:35:39.600
everything with my ghost
writer, which allowed me

00:35:39.600 --> 00:35:42.390
again to see my family,
and then the movie

00:35:42.390 --> 00:35:47.850
as well, as well literary
fests and other faiths.

00:35:47.850 --> 00:35:53.010
So it's been really good
to have all these things.

00:35:53.010 --> 00:35:55.950
And on the side, I've always
gone and seen my family.

00:35:55.950 --> 00:35:58.230
But additionally
to that too, I've

00:35:58.230 --> 00:36:01.060
seen the orphanage
as well quite a lot.

00:36:01.060 --> 00:36:02.910
There has to be harmony.

00:36:02.910 --> 00:36:08.910
And I've being quite grateful
for what's happened to me.

00:36:08.910 --> 00:36:12.126
But there are
children out there.

00:36:12.126 --> 00:36:13.780
Their story's a
little bit different.

00:36:13.780 --> 00:36:15.480
And it's what's
happened to them, too.

00:36:15.480 --> 00:36:18.330
So helping out the orphanage
is a major, major thing

00:36:18.330 --> 00:36:21.720
that I want to do and
have been doing, as well,

00:36:21.720 --> 00:36:24.389
as well as seeing
my family, too.

00:36:24.389 --> 00:36:26.430
CASEY WHITELAW: I'm going
to open up to the floor

00:36:26.430 --> 00:36:28.110
here in Sydney, as well.

00:36:28.110 --> 00:36:29.850
I'm sorry for the
people in other offices

00:36:29.850 --> 00:36:31.560
that I can't open up to you.

00:36:31.560 --> 00:36:34.140
There's a couple of microphones.

00:36:34.140 --> 00:36:36.810
And I see a first
question up here

00:36:36.810 --> 00:36:40.450
and then a second one
over at this side.

00:36:40.450 --> 00:36:41.317
AUDIENCE: Hello.

00:36:41.317 --> 00:36:42.650
Thanks for coming, first of all.

00:36:42.650 --> 00:36:44.399
Amazing story.

00:36:44.399 --> 00:36:46.190
I just wanted to ask,
have you had a chance

00:36:46.190 --> 00:36:50.390
to try Google Earth and
the recently released

00:36:50.390 --> 00:36:51.416
virtual reality?

00:36:51.416 --> 00:36:53.040
It actually reminds
me of what you were

00:36:53.040 --> 00:36:54.850
saying about astral projection.

00:36:54.850 --> 00:36:56.660
It's quite a
powerful experience,

00:36:56.660 --> 00:36:59.185
even for someone who doesn't
have the story that you have.

00:36:59.185 --> 00:37:01.310
If you haven't tried it,
we'd be happy to show you.

00:37:01.310 --> 00:37:03.044
SAROO BRIERLEY: Is
that the liquid--

00:37:03.044 --> 00:37:04.335
CASEY WHITELAW: This is the VR.

00:37:04.335 --> 00:37:05.460
SAROO BRIERLEY: Oh, the VR?

00:37:05.460 --> 00:37:06.455
Oh, no, no, I haven't.

00:37:06.455 --> 00:37:08.740
No, I haven't.

00:37:08.740 --> 00:37:11.090
But yeah, sure,
I'd love to try it,

00:37:11.090 --> 00:37:12.867
as long as it's not
scary as what I did.

00:37:12.867 --> 00:37:14.450
CASEY WHITELAW: We're
sending you home

00:37:14.450 --> 00:37:15.720
with a Daydream View today.

00:37:15.720 --> 00:37:19.200
So we should be getting hooked
up on Google Earth on VR soon.

00:37:19.200 --> 00:37:20.450
SAROO BRIERLEY: That'd be fun.

00:37:20.450 --> 00:37:21.560
Love to, yeah.

00:37:21.560 --> 00:37:23.786
I haven't tried it
yet, but I will.

00:37:23.786 --> 00:37:25.910
CASEY WHITELAW: There was
a question just over here

00:37:25.910 --> 00:37:26.610
as well.

00:37:26.610 --> 00:37:27.230
AUDIENCE: Hey, Saroo.

00:37:27.230 --> 00:37:28.438
Thanks so much for coming in.

00:37:28.438 --> 00:37:30.060
It was awesome to listen to you.

00:37:30.060 --> 00:37:32.490
I hear about a lot of
people who come into,

00:37:32.490 --> 00:37:36.940
or who are met with bad
circumstances or big setbacks,

00:37:36.940 --> 00:37:38.690
and they almost become
fearless afterward,

00:37:38.690 --> 00:37:40.189
because they know
that they probably

00:37:40.189 --> 00:37:42.400
won't hit that low again.

00:37:42.400 --> 00:37:44.300
And you talk about
your ambition to leave

00:37:44.300 --> 00:37:46.970
a legacy in the same line
as Tesla and these guys.

00:37:46.970 --> 00:37:48.560
I'm wondering if
your experience has

00:37:48.560 --> 00:37:51.590
made you somewhat fearless
against the kind of threat

00:37:51.590 --> 00:37:55.546
or the setbacks that you
could face in that pursuit.

00:37:55.546 --> 00:37:56.420
You know what I mean?

00:37:56.420 --> 00:37:57.544
SAROO BRIERLEY: Yeah, yeah.

00:37:57.544 --> 00:38:03.200
I guess being in Kolkata,
you had to be fearless.

00:38:03.200 --> 00:38:11.420
And now being an adult, I guess
that's being in a lucky country

00:38:11.420 --> 00:38:16.220
you become a little--

00:38:16.220 --> 00:38:24.740
more fear, I guess, because
you're not in the same world,

00:38:24.740 --> 00:38:27.070
in the same realm.

00:38:27.070 --> 00:38:29.320
There's India, which
you fight to survive.

00:38:29.320 --> 00:38:32.200
Then it's Australia.

00:38:32.200 --> 00:38:35.800
It's a Westernized
world, as opposed to--

00:38:35.800 --> 00:38:37.810
in a different world.

00:38:37.810 --> 00:38:40.640
And I guess I've
become a bit soft.

00:38:43.760 --> 00:38:47.870
But Saroo, as a child, as
a five-year-old, contending

00:38:47.870 --> 00:38:53.450
what he did, reminds me of
if Saroo saw you now kind

00:38:53.450 --> 00:38:56.600
of thing, getting scared
in front of a spider,

00:38:56.600 --> 00:38:58.020
he'd be shame on you.

00:38:58.020 --> 00:38:59.240
You know what I mean?

00:38:59.240 --> 00:38:59.750
[LAUGHTER]

00:38:59.750 --> 00:39:00.749
So he always reminds me.

00:39:00.749 --> 00:39:05.350
He's that little guidance to
give me strength all the time.

00:39:05.350 --> 00:39:07.830
And you sometimes forget.

00:39:07.830 --> 00:39:13.070
But yeah, I'm very lucky to
have him, even though it's me.

00:39:13.070 --> 00:39:14.960
[LAUGHS] He reminds
me of myself.

00:39:14.960 --> 00:39:17.960
He's like, look
what you've done,

00:39:17.960 --> 00:39:19.969
and look what you've
conquered, and what

00:39:19.969 --> 00:39:21.260
you've been through, and so on.

00:39:24.420 --> 00:39:27.240
So I always get reminded by him.

00:39:27.240 --> 00:39:29.945
I hope that answered
your question.

00:39:29.945 --> 00:39:30.820
AUDIENCE: Hey, Saroo.

00:39:30.820 --> 00:39:32.400
Thank you so much for coming in.

00:39:32.400 --> 00:39:35.000
I've really enjoyed
listening to you.

00:39:35.000 --> 00:39:37.820
I'd love to hear more about
what your family are doing now--

00:39:37.820 --> 00:39:41.287
your mum and your sister
and what they're up to.

00:39:41.287 --> 00:39:43.120
SAROO BRIERLEY: Hey,
look, one of the things

00:39:43.120 --> 00:39:45.230
is I bought my mum a house.

00:39:45.230 --> 00:39:46.287
And--

00:39:46.287 --> 00:39:49.029
[APPLAUSE]

00:39:50.440 --> 00:39:54.490
Before, as children we couldn't
afford anything really.

00:39:54.490 --> 00:40:02.350
We lived on renting and having
milk, pretty much something

00:40:02.350 --> 00:40:04.540
sustainable, as opposed
to other things,

00:40:04.540 --> 00:40:05.590
which we couldn't afford.

00:40:05.590 --> 00:40:07.230
But a built her a house--

00:40:07.230 --> 00:40:10.480
bought her a house,
which is the same house

00:40:10.480 --> 00:40:14.590
that she's been living
in for the last 25 years.

00:40:14.590 --> 00:40:17.329
And she didn't want to
move to another house.

00:40:17.329 --> 00:40:18.370
She wanted to stay there.

00:40:18.370 --> 00:40:20.590
Her friends are close by.

00:40:20.590 --> 00:40:22.010
I helped my sister out.

00:40:22.010 --> 00:40:24.230
I helped my brother out.

00:40:24.230 --> 00:40:29.020
And they've got houses as
well, and helping my niece

00:40:29.020 --> 00:40:35.260
and nephews as well for
schooling and so on.

00:40:35.260 --> 00:40:40.120
So they're doing OK.

00:40:40.120 --> 00:40:43.290
So I'm happy to do that.

00:40:43.290 --> 00:40:45.690
Why wouldn't anyone else
do the same thing anyway?

00:40:49.060 --> 00:40:52.660
AUDIENCE: So my question
was actually very similar,

00:40:52.660 --> 00:40:53.440
about your family.

00:40:53.440 --> 00:40:55.450
And obviously this is
a very incredible story

00:40:55.450 --> 00:40:59.350
and a story that the world has
attached itself to and wants

00:40:59.350 --> 00:41:02.182
to hear and has gathered
some international attention.

00:41:02.182 --> 00:41:03.640
And your family is
very excited now

00:41:03.640 --> 00:41:06.310
that you found them
and you're reconnected.

00:41:06.310 --> 00:41:10.600
How do they feel about
the international exposure

00:41:10.600 --> 00:41:11.590
of this story?

00:41:11.590 --> 00:41:16.090
Is it something that
is difficult for them?

00:41:16.090 --> 00:41:18.610
Or do they really
want to share it?

00:41:18.610 --> 00:41:20.470
I imagine that that's
a very personal thing.

00:41:20.470 --> 00:41:21.590
SAROO BRIERLEY: My
biological family?

00:41:21.590 --> 00:41:22.770
AUDIENCE: Yeah, your
biological family.

00:41:22.770 --> 00:41:24.978
SAROO BRIERLEY: Yeah, look,
I don't think they really

00:41:24.978 --> 00:41:30.100
understood the extent of
what this story is globally,

00:41:30.100 --> 00:41:31.480
and the book and the movie.

00:41:34.570 --> 00:41:38.720
I think that they're just
very conservative people.

00:41:38.720 --> 00:41:47.180
And I don't think it hit them
until now of what it really is

00:41:47.180 --> 00:41:51.380
and how amazing it is to people.

00:41:51.380 --> 00:41:53.764
It's a unique, profound story.

00:41:53.764 --> 00:41:55.180
And I guess they're
a bit like me,

00:41:55.180 --> 00:41:57.460
too-- you know,
seeing is believing.

00:41:57.460 --> 00:41:58.460
I heard a lot of things.

00:41:58.460 --> 00:42:02.980
But when I saw it, it
made my feelings change.

00:42:02.980 --> 00:42:05.450
And so now it's really hit them.

00:42:05.450 --> 00:42:10.360
And they're quite
like, wow, really?

00:42:10.360 --> 00:42:11.050
This is my son.

00:42:11.050 --> 00:42:11.630
This is us.

00:42:11.630 --> 00:42:16.750
It's a story about
what has happened.

00:42:16.750 --> 00:42:20.120
But they're humble and
grateful about everything.

00:42:20.120 --> 00:42:24.160
And I think the end of the
day, for them, it's really

00:42:24.160 --> 00:42:26.499
that I'm back in their lives.

00:42:26.499 --> 00:42:27.040
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:42:27.040 --> 00:42:31.030
I wonder how are your
sleeping patterns now?

00:42:31.030 --> 00:42:33.010
SAROO BRIERLEY: Oh,
where do I start?

00:42:33.010 --> 00:42:36.580
I just got in from
Bahrain last night.

00:42:36.580 --> 00:42:39.330
Not building sandcastles, but--

00:42:39.330 --> 00:42:43.150
AUDIENCE: Did the dreams stop
once you found your hometown?

00:42:43.150 --> 00:42:45.970
SAROO BRIERLEY: Yeah, it did.

00:42:45.970 --> 00:42:48.610
The weights on my
shoulders diffused.

00:42:48.610 --> 00:42:54.710
And those dreams of the astral
projection-- all that stopped.

00:42:54.710 --> 00:42:56.110
I don't have them anymore.

00:42:56.110 --> 00:42:57.880
I haven't had them
for four years.

00:43:01.860 --> 00:43:05.430
So that gives me a
better sleep, I guess.

00:43:05.430 --> 00:43:07.140
[LAUGHTER]

00:43:07.140 --> 00:43:12.240
I'm not so moody in the
morning, not wanting

00:43:12.240 --> 00:43:18.148
to do my chores in the house--

00:43:18.148 --> 00:43:20.121
back then, you know.

00:43:22.890 --> 00:43:24.660
But you know what,
actually just to expand

00:43:24.660 --> 00:43:27.540
on that, having those astral
projection isn't always

00:43:27.540 --> 00:43:33.630
a good thing for people,
having flashes come back

00:43:33.630 --> 00:43:36.660
at you during the night
and during the day.

00:43:39.570 --> 00:43:41.790
Having a photographic
memory of things

00:43:41.790 --> 00:43:45.570
isn't always great, of
being retold something

00:43:45.570 --> 00:43:50.490
that you don't want to see
anymore or think about anymore.

00:43:50.490 --> 00:43:54.840
But I'm very fortunate and lucky
that those astral projections

00:43:54.840 --> 00:43:57.660
and dreams were there
for a reason, a guidance

00:43:57.660 --> 00:44:00.660
from my brother that
was pushing and pulling

00:44:00.660 --> 00:44:06.510
the energy of the
universe, being there too,

00:44:06.510 --> 00:44:11.850
the planets or celestial
beings aligning in a way

00:44:11.850 --> 00:44:14.670
to find my way back home.

00:44:14.670 --> 00:44:18.970
AUDIENCE: I have two quick
hypothetical questions.

00:44:18.970 --> 00:44:20.760
The first is, how
long would you have

00:44:20.760 --> 00:44:25.020
kept on looking had you not
found them after five years?

00:44:25.020 --> 00:44:28.800
And the second is, if you could
guide your five-year-old self

00:44:28.800 --> 00:44:31.410
to get on the right train,
would you have done it,

00:44:31.410 --> 00:44:38.760
or would you just keep
going on the wrong train?

00:44:38.760 --> 00:44:42.062
SAROO BRIERLEY: I would have
searched until the day I

00:44:42.062 --> 00:44:42.872
would have died.

00:44:42.872 --> 00:44:44.580
It's not something I
would have given up.

00:44:44.580 --> 00:44:49.510
When I come across
something, I don't give up.

00:44:49.510 --> 00:44:53.430
I believe that everything
is possible in this world.

00:44:56.130 --> 00:44:57.420
Life is just a jigsaw.

00:44:57.420 --> 00:45:00.650
What we want to do in
finding things, whatever

00:45:00.650 --> 00:45:04.360
it may be, as
crazy as it sounds,

00:45:04.360 --> 00:45:05.980
there's a way of getting there.

00:45:05.980 --> 00:45:09.070
It just takes time to get there.

00:45:09.070 --> 00:45:14.460
So for me, I would
have kept on going.

00:45:14.460 --> 00:45:19.740
But in regards to the
train, sometimes catching

00:45:19.740 --> 00:45:23.520
the wrong train can get
you to the right station.

00:45:23.520 --> 00:45:25.710
And that's how, I
guess, it was for me.

00:45:25.710 --> 00:45:28.950
Even though I went through so
much trials and tribulations,

00:45:28.950 --> 00:45:34.770
I came out at the end, from my
adoptive mother's perspective,

00:45:34.770 --> 00:45:38.510
traumatized, but I
disassociated myself.

00:45:38.510 --> 00:45:42.180
Even though I always had the
memories, but I didn't let

00:45:42.180 --> 00:45:42.990
them overtake me.

00:45:42.990 --> 00:45:48.840
So I guess it was
just my destiny

00:45:48.840 --> 00:45:51.420
to go through what I did.

00:45:51.420 --> 00:45:55.200
And it just happened that way--

00:45:55.200 --> 00:45:58.620
some of it not so
fruitful and nice.

00:45:58.620 --> 00:46:02.800
But it just happened that way.

00:46:02.800 --> 00:46:06.060
And let's not cry
over spilt milk.

00:46:09.720 --> 00:46:11.184
AUDIENCE: Saroo,
one of the things

00:46:11.184 --> 00:46:13.600
that touched me in the film
was when you set off the train

00:46:13.600 --> 00:46:15.660
and spoke a different
language to the people who

00:46:15.660 --> 00:46:17.700
surrounded you.

00:46:17.700 --> 00:46:20.282
I'm just curious as to
do you recall any of--

00:46:20.282 --> 00:46:22.740
I think it was Hindi in the
film is the way it's presented.

00:46:22.740 --> 00:46:23.977
Do you still speak any Hindi?

00:46:23.977 --> 00:46:24.810
Do you remember any?

00:46:24.810 --> 00:46:28.770
Have you learnt any since being
reconnected with your family?

00:46:28.770 --> 00:46:32.550
SAROO BRIERLEY: Look, I only
knew about six to seven words

00:46:32.550 --> 00:46:33.700
of Hindi.

00:46:33.700 --> 00:46:35.430
That's it.

00:46:35.430 --> 00:46:37.890
I couldn't even string
a sentence together.

00:46:37.890 --> 00:46:42.390
And hence, I
couldn't articulate.

00:46:42.390 --> 00:46:44.890
Coming to Kolkata was--

00:46:44.890 --> 00:46:46.230
you speak Bengali there.

00:46:46.230 --> 00:46:48.120
So I didn't speak Bengali.

00:46:48.120 --> 00:46:53.250
And I only spoke a few words
of Hindi and that's it.

00:46:53.250 --> 00:46:55.030
My best friend was my sister.

00:46:55.030 --> 00:46:59.300
She couldn't even say anything.

00:46:59.300 --> 00:47:04.740
And so that was against me.

00:47:04.740 --> 00:47:08.310
And the first thing that
you learn as a child

00:47:08.310 --> 00:47:11.430
is what's your mum's
name, your last name,

00:47:11.430 --> 00:47:13.080
your father's
name, phone number,

00:47:13.080 --> 00:47:14.890
and the street that you live in.

00:47:14.890 --> 00:47:16.130
But I didn't have that.

00:47:16.130 --> 00:47:19.370
My knowledge was very minimal.

00:47:19.370 --> 00:47:22.320
And I had to use
my visual memories,

00:47:22.320 --> 00:47:27.300
which were heightened, as
opposed to my auditorial.

00:47:27.300 --> 00:47:30.150
And that's why I have
these memories of my past,

00:47:30.150 --> 00:47:32.880
and my hometown, and the
architecture of the place,

00:47:32.880 --> 00:47:35.940
and so on.

00:47:35.940 --> 00:47:40.710
So yeah, Calcutta
was very difficult.

00:47:40.710 --> 00:47:43.590
No one would understand
what I was saying, really.

00:47:43.590 --> 00:47:46.620
But when I asked for
Burhanpur, no one would know.

00:47:46.620 --> 00:47:48.490
It's like, where?

00:47:51.440 --> 00:47:53.302
AUDIENCE: What's next?

00:47:53.302 --> 00:47:56.692
You spent five years-- drive,
determination, full commitment

00:47:56.692 --> 00:47:57.656
to a cause.

00:47:57.656 --> 00:48:00.976
What's next in the
plan after the book?

00:48:00.976 --> 00:48:02.880
SAROO BRIERLEY: Well,
it's a bit crazy.

00:48:02.880 --> 00:48:08.280
But I want to get into
physics, so space propulsion.

00:48:08.280 --> 00:48:09.090
Yeah.

00:48:09.090 --> 00:48:13.156
I'm not going to shoot myself
what I'm going to do with it.

00:48:13.156 --> 00:48:15.950
That's a bit ahead of my time.

00:48:15.950 --> 00:48:19.042
But that's next for me.

00:48:19.042 --> 00:48:23.880
And I'm in the process of
writing the prequel to "Lion,"

00:48:23.880 --> 00:48:28.920
which is talking about
how from adoptive mother

00:48:28.920 --> 00:48:35.250
to my biological mother to
Saroj Sood, the lady that

00:48:35.250 --> 00:48:39.130
helped at the orphanage
to get me to Australia--

00:48:39.130 --> 00:48:44.160
how they're all related, from
states apart to oceans apart,

00:48:44.160 --> 00:48:47.250
and how their
dreams and what they

00:48:47.250 --> 00:48:49.950
want to do in life in
regards to helping children

00:48:49.950 --> 00:48:51.970
has come about.

00:48:51.970 --> 00:48:56.500
From Saroj Sood, who's the
owner of the orphanage in India,

00:48:56.500 --> 00:49:02.850
ISSA, how she three went through
her trials and tribulations,

00:49:02.850 --> 00:49:06.360
with Mother Teresa helping
out and so on, and then

00:49:06.360 --> 00:49:09.930
wanting to go out by herself,
and her family situation

00:49:09.930 --> 00:49:13.950
as well, from being
a lawyer to wanting

00:49:13.950 --> 00:49:17.110
to help children in India
that are in so much need.

00:49:17.110 --> 00:49:24.020
So I think putting the
prequel out and the story--

00:49:24.020 --> 00:49:27.600
a book first and then
hopefully a movie next--

00:49:27.600 --> 00:49:31.110
would really make people
understand even more in depth

00:49:31.110 --> 00:49:36.240
what "Lion" is about as well,
because it goes even deeper.

00:49:36.240 --> 00:49:39.914
So there's that end and
my crazy thing as well.

00:49:39.914 --> 00:49:42.330
CASEY WHITELAW: I think that's
a really great place for us

00:49:42.330 --> 00:49:43.290
to wrap up.

00:49:43.290 --> 00:49:45.900
So Saroo, thank you so much
for your time and coming in.

00:49:45.900 --> 00:49:46.610
SAROO BRIERLEY: Thank you.

00:49:46.610 --> 00:49:48.443
CASEY WHITELAW: Yeah,
everyone, thank Saroo.

00:49:48.443 --> 00:49:51.636
[APPLAUSE]

00:50:02.570 --> 00:50:06.546
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:50:59.910 --> 00:51:01.110
SAROO BRIERLEY: Thanks.

00:51:01.110 --> 00:51:04.160
