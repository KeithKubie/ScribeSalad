00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:15.450
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:17.870
What's my most striking
feature?

00:00:17.870 --> 00:00:19.900
Is it my Christmas jumper?

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:24.560
Is it my height, or
my ginger hair?

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:27.450
Sadly, my ginger hair was often
the brunt of jokes when

00:00:27.450 --> 00:00:28.470
I was younger.

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:31.620
But hopefully, many of you can
see this is rather silly, and

00:00:31.620 --> 00:00:34.630
it becomes even more so when
you consider the minute

00:00:34.630 --> 00:00:36.808
genetic differences that
give rise to it.

00:00:36.808 --> 00:00:43.360
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:45.740
So up on the screen
are two hairs.

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:48.370
On the right is a brown
hair from my wife.

00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:51.810
On the left is one of my
hairs, a ginger hair.

00:00:51.810 --> 00:00:54.040
And when we look down the
microscope, you can't really

00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:57.220
see too much of a difference,
except for the obvious one,

00:00:57.220 --> 00:00:59.865
which is one is a lot darker
than the other.

00:00:59.865 --> 00:01:03.060
Now the difference between these
two hairs is mostly down

00:01:03.060 --> 00:01:06.280
to a gene found on chromosome
16 called melanocortin 1

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:10.030
receptor, or MC1R for short.

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:12.190
And this gene controls
the type of pigment

00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:14.130
produced in the hair.

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:16.640
Brown hairs like the one on the
right contain a lot of a

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:19.050
dark pigment called eumelanin.

00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:22.440
Ginger hairs like mine contain
a lot of a lighter pigment

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:23.000
called pheomelanin.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:28.250
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:32.100
This here is all 954
bases of MC1R.

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:35.170
 

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:39.430
And this here is a version of
the gene that gives rise to

00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:42.250
ginger hair like mine.

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:44.880
Now the difference between them
might not be immediately

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:48.140
apparent, so I'm going to show
you exactly how these differ.

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:51.120
 

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:57.050
There, just one single base
change in all 954 is enough to

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:59.060
give me ginger hair.

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:02.080
So there are actually a number
of these MC1R gene variants,

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:05.060
so basically alternate versions
with a single

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:08.759
spelling difference, that can
give rise to ginger hair.

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:11.650
And this isn't confined
to the MC1R gene.

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:14.560
You can find a number of these
single spelling differences

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:16.490
throughout the human genome.

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:19.790
There are about 60 million of
them, and we call them single

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:21.040
nucleotide polymorphisms.

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:24.890
 

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:27.680
Most of these spelling
differences are invisible,

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:31.130
meaning that they don't change
how we look on the outside.

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:34.270
But at the genetic level, they
still differentiate one person

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:36.080
from another.

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:38.620
But even when they do give rise
to something like ginger

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:42.270
hair, doesn't it seem rather
stupid to pick on someone for

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:45.250
essentially one base pair
difference out of the three

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:46.970
billion that make
up our genome?

00:02:46.970 --> 00:03:05.201
