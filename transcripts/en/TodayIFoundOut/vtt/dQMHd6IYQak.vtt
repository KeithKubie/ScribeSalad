00:00:04.180 --> 00:00:12.639
To 
some extent the answer to the question of

00:00:12.639 --> 00:00:17.949
whether some humans are born with tails and
how prevalent it is depends on your definition

00:00:17.949 --> 00:00:19.060
of “tail.”

00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:24.940
For instance, a variety of things may protrude
from the tailbone of a newborn, including

00:00:24.940 --> 00:00:28.160
cysts, tumors and even a parasitic twin.

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:33.129
But very rarely a human is born with an actual
extra appendage that is generally considered

00:00:33.129 --> 00:00:34.199
a vestigial tail.

00:00:34.199 --> 00:00:39.100
During fetal development, the human embryo
at about the 5th week has a tail that usually

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:43.430
disappears by the 8th week, being absorbed
by the growing embryo.

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:48.230
However, for a rare few, the tail is not absorbed
and persists through birth.

00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:52.510
Typically (for those exceptionally few born
with tails), the appendage in question is

00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:57.640
comprised of adipose and connective tissue,
bundles of striated muscle and even nerves

00:00:57.640 --> 00:00:58.890
and blood vessels.

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:04.250
Noticeably absent from even a vestigial tail,
however, are any sign of vertebrae or controlled

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:05.250
movement.

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:11.060
As for specific examples, in 2012, the paper,
Spectrum of human tails: A report of six cases,

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:16.040
detailing the experience of a handful of patients
with vestigial tails, ranging in age from

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:17.680
3 days to 2 years.

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:22.540
Of the six, four of the tails were situated
in the lumbar area, and, perhaps not surprisingly,

00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:26.689
three of the patients had spina bifida (a
congenital defect where the lower part of

00:01:26.689 --> 00:01:29.780
the spinal cord is exposed through a hole
in the spine).

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:34.640
One child had a tail protruding from his buttock,
while the last had a protrusion from the sacral

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:35.640
region.

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:40.119
Five of the six had no connection between
their tails and spines, and they underwent

00:01:40.119 --> 00:01:43.409
successful surgeries to remove the unwanted
appendages.

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:47.750
The sixth’s parents refused to give consent,
although it is not clear why, and the doctors

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:50.420
in question were not able to follow up with
that child.

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:55.540
Notably, in one of the children, her tail
unusually included bone, as well as cartilage,

00:01:55.540 --> 00:02:08.280
fat and neural tissue.
