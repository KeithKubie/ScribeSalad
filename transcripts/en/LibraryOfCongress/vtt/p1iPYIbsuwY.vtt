&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington, DC.

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:20.890
&gt;&gt; Joan Weeks: Well, good
afternoon, ladies and gentlemen.

00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:24.440
On behalf of all my colleagues, and
in particular Dr. Mary-Jane Deeb,

00:00:24.440 --> 00:00:26.770
Chief of the African and
Middle East Division,

00:00:26.770 --> 00:00:29.710
I'd like to extend a very
warm welcome to everyone.

00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:34.170
I'm Joan Weeks, Head of the Near
East Section, that is the sponsor

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:37.310
of today's program, along
with the Asian Division

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:40.630
and the Roshan Institute
for Persian Studies.

00:00:40.630 --> 00:00:44.280
We are very pleased to continue
the Persian Book Lecture Series

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:48.360
with today's program on Persian
Manuscripts in India, Collections,

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:50.860
Curators, and their Future.

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:54.320
Before we start today's program
and introduce our speaker,

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:57.290
I'd like to just give you a
brief overview of our Division

00:00:57.290 --> 00:01:00.460
and its resources in the
hopes that you'll come back

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:04.950
and use this Reading Room and the
Asian Division for your research.

00:01:04.950 --> 00:01:07.510
First of all, there's cards,

00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:11.270
you can get a Reader Registration
Card downstairs on the first floor,

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:17.330
and then come back up and search in
our catalogue at catalogue.loc.gov,

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:21.090 position:56%
and search on terms; for example, if
you were interested in future study

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:25.190
on Persian Manuscripts, you could
do a key word subject search,

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:28.380
and you could refine
your search to India,

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:32.000
and a pull up Persian
Manuscripts in India,

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.770
and you can even limit by language.

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:38.910
So, you can retrieve materials
in the language of your choice.

00:01:38.910 --> 00:01:42.600
In this Reading Room, we
cover Arabic, Persian,

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:48.960 position:56%
2000 languages in over 78 countries.

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:52.640
This is a custodial division,
comprised of three sections

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:56.270
that build and serve the
collections for researchers,

00:01:56.270 --> 00:02:01.430
and we have our Africa section that
covers all of Sub-Saharan Africa.

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:05.530
The Hebraic Section is
responsible for Hebraic worldwide,

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:08.890
and the New East Section covers
all of the Arab countries,

00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:13.110
including North Africa, Turkey,
Turkic Central Asia, Iran,

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:17.340
Afghanistan, the Muslims from
Western China, Russia, the Balkans,

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:19.490
and the people of the caucuses.

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:25.030
I'd also like to invite you
to try our Four Corners Blog.

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:30.700
Here, our curators give you very
special glimpses of our collections

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:33.800
and very interesting articles.

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:37.970
And you can also hear and
receive alerts about our programs

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:40.690
on Facebook and using our RS Feeds.

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:43.900
So, this little flyer gives
you a wealth of information,

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:46.000 position:56%
and if you subscribe, you'll be able

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:50.450
to get many more alerts
about future programs.

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:55.950 position:56%
And I also would like to remind you
that this program is being recorded.

00:02:55.950 --> 00:03:00.270
We invite you to ask questions
at the end, but if you do,

00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:05.600
you're implicitly giving us
permission for you to be recorded.

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:10.810
So, now, I'd like to call upon
Jonathan Loar of the Asian Division

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:14.340
to give you a quick overview
of the Asian Division,

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:15.640
and then he'll introduce
further speakers.

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:17.940
Thank you.

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:20.840
&gt;&gt; Jonathan Loar: Hi everybody.

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:23.660
Many thanks to John and Hirad
and the rest of the African

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:26.100
and Middle Eastern Division,
as well as Matthew Miller

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:28.210
and the Russian Center,
the University of Maryland,

00:03:28.210 --> 00:03:32.000
for helping to organize today's
lecture with Dr. Shekhar.

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:33.390
So, my name is Jonathan Loar,

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:36.710
and I'm the Asian Division's
South Asian Reference Librarian

00:03:36.710 --> 00:03:40.530
and Recommending Officer for
India, Nepal, and Sri Lanka.

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:42.220
Before we get started, I just
want to give a little background

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:44.160
about the Asian Division,
which is one

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:46.590
of the co-sponsors
of today's lecture.

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:50.470
So, founded in 1928, the Asian
Division has custody of more

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:55.320
than 3.2 million physical items
in over 100 Asian languages.

00:03:55.320 --> 00:03:58.890
The Asian Division has seven
distinct collections, Chinese,

00:03:58.890 --> 00:04:02.160
Japanese, Korean, Tibetan,
Mongolian,

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:04.470
South Asian, and South East Asian.

00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:06.850
This assemblage is one of the
world's largest collections

00:04:06.850 --> 00:04:10.170
of Asian language materials
outside of Asia.

00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:12.710
The gateway for researchers
and the general public

00:04:12.710 --> 00:04:16.640 position:56%
to use these collections is the
Asian Reading Room, which is located

00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:19.800
in Room 150 of the Library's
Thomas Jefferson Building,

00:04:19.800 --> 00:04:21.110
this building here.

00:04:21.110 --> 00:04:23.470
Reference librarians are also
available in the Reading Room

00:04:23.470 --> 00:04:27.330
to assist with any and
all research questions.

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:30.470
The South Asian collection
encompasses materials from Bhutan,

00:04:30.470 --> 00:04:34.690
Bangladesh, India, the Maldives,
Nepal, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka.

00:04:34.690 --> 00:04:37.440
Much of the Library's South
Asian acquisition comes

00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:42.210
through two overseas offices, one
in New Delhi, which opened in 1962,

00:04:42.210 --> 00:04:45.550
and the other in Islamabad,
which opened in 1965.

00:04:45.550 --> 00:04:47.190
Currently, the South
Asian collection has more

00:04:47.190 --> 00:04:51.460
than 300,000 monographed
volumes, more than 1,600 journals

00:04:51.460 --> 00:04:56.070
with 67,000 issues for
active and inactive journals,

00:04:56.070 --> 00:04:59.050 position:56%
more than 18,000 reels of microfilm,

00:04:59.050 --> 00:05:02.480
and more than 68,000
titles in microfiche.

00:05:02.480 --> 00:05:07.300
These items are available in Urdu,
Hindi, Bengali, Tamil, Punjabi,

00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:10.540 position:56%
Gujarati, Sindhi, Nepali, Subscript,
Malayalam, Telugu, Canada,

00:05:10.540 --> 00:05:12.820
and many other modern languages.

00:05:12.820 --> 00:05:15.000
The South Asian collection, like
the other Asian collections,

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:19.030 position:56%
also has a large and growing list of
electronic resources and databases.

00:05:19.030 --> 00:05:21.540
Overall, this collection
provides broad research coverage

00:05:21.540 --> 00:05:24.370
in most fields and disciplines,
particularly in the areas

00:05:24.370 --> 00:05:28.830 position:56%
of vernacular languages, literature,
religion, philosophy, history,

00:05:28.830 --> 00:05:32.620
politics, and also
South Asian society.

00:05:32.620 --> 00:05:36.220
It is also especially strong with
regard to newspapers, journals,

00:05:36.220 --> 00:05:38.840
and government publications
from South Asia.

00:05:38.840 --> 00:05:41.490
And without further ado, I'd
like to invite Fatemeh Keshavarz

00:05:41.490 --> 00:05:43.440
of the University of Maryland

00:05:43.440 --> 00:05:45.570
up to say a few words
ahead of today's lecture.

00:05:45.570 --> 00:05:47.370
Thank you.

00:05:47.370 --> 00:05:51.700
[ Audience Applause ]

00:05:51.700 --> 00:05:53.000
&gt;&gt; Fatemeh Keshavarz:
Thank you very much.

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:56.940
I'm director of Roshan
Institute for Persian Studies

00:05:56.940 --> 00:05:58.980
at the University of Maryland.

00:05:58.980 --> 00:06:03.830
I'm delighted to let you know
that we do have a full program

00:06:03.830 --> 00:06:07.880
in Persian Studies in which
students can major and minor

00:06:07.880 --> 00:06:11.480
in the language studies, but
they also can take a wide range

00:06:11.480 --> 00:06:15.540
of courses in various
areas of culture

00:06:15.540 --> 00:06:20.620
and literature to enrich
their studies.

00:06:20.620 --> 00:06:24.150
But I wanted to just
very briefly for a couple

00:06:24.150 --> 00:06:28.190
of minutes tell you that,
but of course, as I came here

00:06:28.190 --> 00:06:32.620
to start directing the Institute
five years ago, one of my goals was

00:06:32.620 --> 00:06:38.250
to connect to as many
centers of learning and areas

00:06:38.250 --> 00:06:43.140
in which we could actually come
out of the classroom and be

00:06:43.140 --> 00:06:47.090
with the people who are interested
in what we have to offer.

00:06:47.090 --> 00:06:50.720
And the first place and
the most exciting place

00:06:50.720 --> 00:06:53.490
that I have found has been
the Library of Congress.

00:06:53.490 --> 00:06:57.420
There's absolutely no other
place I can compare with this,

00:06:57.420 --> 00:07:01.180
and I remember when we were
searching for a home in the area,

00:07:01.180 --> 00:07:08.000
my one criteria was how close is
it to the Library of Congress.

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:12.980
And you know, as a monument really
to the significance of learning,

00:07:12.980 --> 00:07:19.030
the Library has now taken a
bigger and more important step

00:07:19.030 --> 00:07:24.170
of interaction with people because
you can store knowledge in the form

00:07:24.170 --> 00:07:27.500
of books and manuscripts, but
there's a lot of difference

00:07:27.500 --> 00:07:30.930
between that and bringing
it to the people.

00:07:30.930 --> 00:07:37.930 position:56%
So, this monument has been enlivened
with spirits of learning and work

00:07:37.930 --> 00:07:43.520
and interaction and reaching out
to people like Mary-Jane Deeb,

00:07:43.520 --> 00:07:49.210
like Hirad Dinavari, who will
speak to you, like my colleague,

00:07:49.210 --> 00:07:52.190
director of the Middle
Eastern Studies, Joan,

00:07:52.190 --> 00:07:53.920
who just spoke earlier,

00:07:53.920 --> 00:07:58.750
and it really is a tremendous
pleasure for us to work together.

00:07:58.750 --> 00:08:01.020
I'm not going to go through
the history of what we've done

00:08:01.020 --> 00:08:05.800
because it will take too long, but
we will continue what we are doing

00:08:05.800 --> 00:08:09.900
in days like this, and it is
really a tremendous pleasure

00:08:09.900 --> 00:08:12.460
to be hosting Professor
Chander Shekhar,

00:08:12.460 --> 00:08:17.600
who gave a beautiful talk
yesterday to a full room

00:08:17.600 --> 00:08:22.980
of young Persian learners, who
were delighted to hear about India

00:08:22.980 --> 00:08:28.720
and the role that that tremendous
culture has had in the development

00:08:28.720 --> 00:08:33.710
of Persian, basically being a hub
for Persian culture and literature.

00:08:33.710 --> 00:08:37.040
So, with that, I thank
you all for being here.

00:08:37.040 --> 00:08:39.730
I look forward to many more
occasions such as this.

00:08:39.730 --> 00:08:41.530
Thank you.

00:08:41.530 --> 00:08:45.260
[ Audience Applause ]

00:08:45.260 --> 00:08:46.830
&gt;&gt; Hirad Dinavari: Thank
you very much Dr. Keshavarz

00:08:46.830 --> 00:08:48.130

That was very, very
generous and kind of you.

00:08:50.600 --> 00:08:55.500
Also, I want to thank you for
making it possible for Dr. Shekhar

to come here from India, and
I'm glad that Roshan is working

00:08:59.410 --> 00:09:01.740
with wonderful scholars
of his caliber.

00:09:01.740 --> 00:09:03.670
Without taking too much time,

00:09:03.670 --> 00:09:06.130
I'm going to read his
very distinguished bio.

00:09:06.130 --> 00:09:09.720
It's a very long bio, so
please don't be offended

00:09:09.720 --> 00:09:11.220
if I cut it a bit short.

00:09:11.220 --> 00:09:13.560
Thank you very much.

00:09:13.560 --> 00:09:15.890
First of all, and I must say

00:11:42.370 --> 00:11:47.680
His edited texts have been edited
by internationally known scholars

00:11:47.680 --> 00:11:52.450
like Professor Carl Ernst, Columbia
University; Professor Fabrizio,

00:11:52.450 --> 00:11:59.550

00:12:04.060 --> 00:12:08.990
and also Professor
Robert Elgood of SOAS.

00:12:08.990 --> 00:12:13.850
He is also a project in
charge and chief editor

00:12:13.850 --> 00:12:17.480
of the multi-volume Lexicon
Farhangar a Yon [phonetic];

00:12:17.480 --> 00:12:21.810
six-volumes have been
published so far.

00:12:21.810 --> 00:12:25.360
It's a Persian English
Hindi and Urdu Lexicon.

00:12:25.360 --> 00:12:28.550
This project is funded by
the Iranian government.

00:12:28.550 --> 00:12:33.760
Recently, he has been selected as
the research guide and consultant

00:12:33.760 --> 00:12:39.650
on a multi Universities of Europe,
South Asia, Central Asia project,

00:12:39.650 --> 00:12:42.070
initiated by the Exeter University.

00:12:42.070 --> 00:12:46.430
European Research Council has
approved the funding for this.

00:12:46.430 --> 00:12:48.790
So, I can go on and on and on.

00:12:48.790 --> 00:12:51.460 position:56%
There's another -- you get the idea.

00:12:51.460 --> 00:12:57.260 position:56%
He is the expert, and I have to tell
you, as someone working with Persian

00:12:57.260 --> 00:13:00.340
and with the wonderful
help of University Mellon

00:13:00.340 --> 00:13:03.310
and other scholars, the
unique Persian that comes

00:13:03.310 --> 00:13:07.570
out of the subcontinent, India
and Pakistan, is quite special

00:13:07.570 --> 00:13:11.950
because it's Persian; yet,
it has a heavy terminology

00:13:11.950 --> 00:13:15.610
of Indican sense great and
Hindu terms that Iranians

00:13:15.610 --> 00:13:20.460
and Afghans don't get; and we
really need specialists like him

00:13:20.460 --> 00:13:24.800
who can help us decipher what we
have in our collections from India.

00:13:24.800 --> 00:13:29.430
And last, I can say
easily a third or not more

00:13:29.430 --> 00:13:33.080
of the Persian rare treasures
here are from India, lithographs,

00:13:33.080 --> 00:13:34.830
manuscripts, early imprints.

00:13:34.830 --> 00:13:39.320
It was quite a bit of Persian that
was produced in India by Indians

00:13:39.320 --> 00:13:42.630
for Indian audiences,
as well as for Iranian

00:13:42.630 --> 00:13:44.290
and other Persian speaking
audiences.

00:13:44.290 --> 00:13:45.590
Thank you, Dr. Shekhar.

00:13:45.590 --> 00:13:47.390
&gt;&gt; Chander Shekhar: Thank you.

00:13:47.390 --> 00:14:00.210
[ Audience Applause ]

00:14:00.210 --> 00:14:02.510
&gt;&gt; Chander Shekhar:
I'm totally grateful

00:14:02.510 --> 00:14:08.760
for that learned [inaudible]
officials of [inaudible]

00:14:10.020 --> 00:14:22.630 position:56%
and Middle Eastern Studies,
Library of Congress, especially Joan

00:14:22.630 --> 00:14:33.800 position:56%
and others, Mr. Hirad, and Professor
[inaudible] from Russian Foundation,

00:14:33.800 --> 00:14:42.040
Mellon University, Dr. Matthew,
who have been instrumental

00:14:42.040 --> 00:14:47.280
in making a contact between Delhi
University and Mellon University

00:14:47.280 --> 00:14:54.080
of Library of Congress, and I hope
this initiative will bring more

00:14:54.080 --> 00:14:58.190 position:56%
and more folks to these initiatives.

00:14:58.190 --> 00:15:10.520
In fact, I have come to learn
more, not to speak a lot.

00:15:10.520 --> 00:15:15.810
I'm also fortunate that
truly I'm standing here due

00:15:15.810 --> 00:15:23.530
to my former teacher [inaudible],
whose sister is working

00:15:23.530 --> 00:15:29.000
at this Library, and I
guess [inaudible] here.

00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:38.250
And I'm glad that whatever
I have learned I can pass

00:15:38.250 --> 00:15:44.670
on to the next generation, and
that has been the foremost aim

00:15:44.670 --> 00:15:50.010
of this presentation.

00:15:51.120 --> 00:15:56.710
As every one of you might
be knowing in India,

00:15:56.710 --> 00:16:00.660
Persian became old language.

00:16:00.660 --> 00:16:04.120
I can stay that language of masses.

00:16:04.120 --> 00:16:09.090
Old language, language of elites,

00:16:09.090 --> 00:16:14.920 position:56%
language of ad musician
[phonetic], right from 12th century.

00:16:14.920 --> 00:16:20.950
They are mentioned that Arabic
has been the language of religion

00:16:20.950 --> 00:16:24.050
and the partition of
reading scriptures

00:16:24.050 --> 00:16:31.610
and for the monumental
[inaudible] scripture [inaudible].

00:16:31.610 --> 00:16:38.540
It develops into [inaudible] that
the majority of the rules ruled

00:16:38.540 --> 00:16:46.560
within 12th century until 19th
century, none of them was Iranian,

00:16:46.560 --> 00:16:51.350
but Prussian language dominated.

00:16:51.350 --> 00:16:57.340
The earliest people from
[inaudible] were basically

00:16:57.340 --> 00:17:02.620
from the Neoclassicism idiom,
[inaudible] of their audits,

00:17:02.620 --> 00:17:05.230
of the [inaudible] and the
source of the [inaudible].

00:17:05.230 --> 00:17:08.220
They were all from this.

00:17:08.220 --> 00:17:17.010
We can say that larger
subcontinent part, basically.

00:17:17.010 --> 00:17:22.870
From 15th century until 19th,

00:17:22.870 --> 00:17:28.570
the last word we say [inaudible]
modern empire completely ended

00:17:28.570 --> 00:17:34.590
in 1857.

00:17:34.590 --> 00:17:37.850
They were also not
Iranians, and they were also

00:17:37.850 --> 00:17:41.630
from the minor central
[inaudible], basically.

00:17:41.630 --> 00:17:48.150
But Persian remained as a
language of all of these.

00:17:48.150 --> 00:17:50.990
And not only that [inaudible]
a huge call

00:17:50.990 --> 00:17:57.700
for self-literature not only the
resources, scientific material,

00:17:57.700 --> 00:18:00.350
all was scribed in this language.

00:18:00.350 --> 00:18:07.140 position:56%
If you read third volume of
British level Master of [inaudible],

00:18:07.140 --> 00:18:13.520
you'll find that almost
4,000 manuscripts

00:18:13.520 --> 00:18:19.560
in a single commissioned work
of Illiten Danson [phonetic],

00:18:19.560 --> 00:18:25.270
who wrote History of India, a story
by [inaudible] procured and brought

00:18:25.270 --> 00:18:30.890
to British Library, and these are
to the and [inaudible] of the same.

00:18:30.890 --> 00:18:33.580
Apart from that, there
are many other collections

00:18:33.580 --> 00:18:38.140
which have not been yet catalogued
like the [inaudible] Collection,

00:18:38.140 --> 00:18:41.450
which they are now cataloguing
with [inaudible] Merusla [phonetic]

00:18:41.450 --> 00:18:46.430
with the home art presentation they
sent in the School of Economics.

00:18:46.430 --> 00:18:49.810
There are 137,000.

00:18:49.810 --> 00:18:53.710
If you also look at the
catalogue of the Manuscripts

00:18:53.710 --> 00:18:57.570
of the European libraries,
American libraries,

00:18:57.570 --> 00:19:02.380
majority are highly illustrated and
illuminated masters [inaudible].

00:19:02.380 --> 00:19:12.240
But still, their number may not
go beyond 20 to 35,000 maximum.

00:19:12.240 --> 00:19:17.920 position:56%
And recently until now, we have more

00:19:17.920 --> 00:19:22.070
than 5 [inaudible]
Prussian manuscripts,

00:19:22.070 --> 00:19:28.620
more than 60 [inaudible]
documents in Prussian and India,

00:19:28.620 --> 00:19:36.040
and these are scattered
over in three categories;

00:19:36.040 --> 00:19:40.070
one of the National Library that
has libraries of the Museums

00:19:40.070 --> 00:19:46.000
and the Central Government
control, like National Museum,

00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:49.610
the late [inaudible] Library,

00:19:49.610 --> 00:19:51.110
[inaudible] National
Library [inaudible],

00:19:51.110 --> 00:19:56.470
Solagen Museum [inaudible],
and many others like this.

00:19:56.470 --> 00:19:59.460
Then, there are also
strict libraries,

00:19:59.460 --> 00:20:03.730
which also have Prussian
manuscripts and documents.

00:20:03.730 --> 00:20:07.350
Many of these have been
catalogued and many have not been

00:20:07.350 --> 00:20:14.180
yet because still purchase of
the manuscripts is going on.

00:20:14.180 --> 00:20:16.590
I remember being a member
of the Purchase Committee

00:20:16.590 --> 00:20:19.700
in Lampur just four years back.

00:20:19.700 --> 00:20:24.410
We had purchased about 160
manuscripts just in two days,

00:20:24.410 --> 00:20:29.120
and we gave away about half a
million rupees, and this was,

00:20:29.120 --> 00:20:33.100
that's what's going on, and
these are just in the shelves

00:20:33.100 --> 00:20:37.550
of the libraries, not
catalogued yet.

00:20:37.550 --> 00:20:44.500
So, my submission is that there is
a huge collection of manuscripts

00:20:44.500 --> 00:20:46.550
in government, and there's
a part of collections

00:20:46.550 --> 00:20:49.950
as Russian formation
has been successful

00:20:49.950 --> 00:20:55.360
to persuade [inaudible]
act like no to catalogue

00:20:55.360 --> 00:20:59.700
and destroys their
collection, which is almost at 8

00:20:59.700 --> 00:21:02.220
to 10,000 manuscripts available.

00:21:02.220 --> 00:21:04.790
There are many others.

00:21:04.790 --> 00:21:07.790
In many concords there
are manuscripts.

00:21:07.790 --> 00:21:13.240
There's many of that are
one particular [inaudible]

00:21:13.240 --> 00:21:17.940
that we call [inaudible] them like
a leagus [phonetic] in the known

00:21:17.940 --> 00:21:20.190
and a leagus set basically.

00:21:20.190 --> 00:21:26.990
And these question that not only in
the Muslim collection I'm also had;

00:21:26.990 --> 00:21:29.740
these are in many Hindu
Temples also,

00:21:29.740 --> 00:21:32.430 position:56%
you'll find the Persian manuscripts.

00:21:32.430 --> 00:21:39.000
Documents in Persian, and just
scriptures, often those in Persian,

00:21:39.000 --> 00:21:43.100
and differing manuscripts,
which are out in many American

00:21:43.100 --> 00:21:46.370
and the [inaudible]
libraries from the same faith.

00:21:46.370 --> 00:21:52.060
Also, from the Russians, Jews,
Christianity, a lot, a lot,

00:21:52.060 --> 00:21:55.970
and still we are being out.

00:21:55.970 --> 00:22:00.150
The question is what
we are doing with that

00:22:00.150 --> 00:22:03.630
and what you people
are doing with that.

00:22:03.630 --> 00:22:08.280
This presentation just as
an indicator to the variety

00:22:08.280 --> 00:22:15.100
of the manuscripts we have in
Lampur [inaudible] or Salanga,

00:22:15.100 --> 00:22:17.650
or some illegal [phonetic]
Muslim industry.

00:22:17.650 --> 00:22:20.610
I also mentioned in many
industry [phonetic] libraries,

00:22:20.610 --> 00:22:23.770
in my own [inaudible]
libraries we are

00:22:23.770 --> 00:22:28.920
about 300 manuscripts
of Prussian alone.

00:22:28.920 --> 00:22:33.990
Like as in Alibab industry,
[inaudible] industry,

00:22:33.990 --> 00:22:37.770
[inaudible] industry,
a very good collection.

00:22:37.770 --> 00:22:46.450
When we received these manuscripts,
we had to kind of information.

00:22:46.450 --> 00:22:51.330
One is about the external
physical street.

00:22:51.330 --> 00:22:57.630
Their script, their ears of
the period of the writings,

00:22:57.630 --> 00:23:02.560
and which is also show that
evolution of that Persian and India

00:23:02.560 --> 00:23:05.870
because with the Persian
script or the Arabic script,

00:23:05.870 --> 00:23:09.360
many other scripts like
of Sundi and [inaudible],

00:23:09.360 --> 00:23:11.990
they were also developed.

00:23:11.990 --> 00:23:18.040
And how, even within
the Prussian script,

00:23:18.040 --> 00:23:21.550
letters like [inaudible] they
are [inaudible] were developed,

00:23:21.550 --> 00:23:25.800
and these master tell
us which are the period

00:23:25.800 --> 00:23:30.400
in which this letter
became present form.

00:23:30.400 --> 00:23:35.580
For again, example, the letter
Golf, for G, which is two strokes,

00:23:35.580 --> 00:23:38.880
are you, many of you
know Prussian know.

00:23:38.880 --> 00:23:42.450
Prior to 1830s, as
I was looking at one

00:23:42.450 --> 00:23:46.020
of the manuscripts Hirad had
shown me, and when I remarked

00:23:46.020 --> 00:23:50.570
and he went back to see
the year, and we found it.

00:23:50.570 --> 00:23:54.600
It is from 1830s, prior to
that, we will not find that.

00:23:54.600 --> 00:24:02.070
But in the early 18th century, the
letter P is done only with a book,

00:24:02.070 --> 00:24:05.190
and this is one of the reasons
that only in any of [inaudible]

00:24:05.190 --> 00:24:08.320
that it should be pronounced
like bifose [phonetic],

00:24:08.320 --> 00:24:14.950 position:56%
but in the [inaudible] and it should
be pronounced like [inaudible].

00:24:14.950 --> 00:24:20.540
So, these masters also tell us
about the photographic information.

00:24:20.540 --> 00:24:24.110
Then, we have illustrated
masterpiece of show,

00:24:24.110 --> 00:24:27.030
which are not the imperial

00:24:27.030 --> 00:24:30.470
or the regional old
manuscript illustrations.

00:24:30.470 --> 00:24:33.220
These are from the
masses, and this tell us

00:24:33.220 --> 00:24:36.840
about the society also
and in culture.

00:24:36.840 --> 00:24:41.880
So, that idea when permission about
the art of book working especially,

00:24:41.880 --> 00:24:49.140
that two [inaudible] manuscripts;
one, which was scribed in India,

00:24:49.140 --> 00:24:54.460
and the other which
was from other world.

00:24:54.460 --> 00:24:58.130
Like this, on one hand,
in the Art of Book Making,

00:24:58.130 --> 00:25:07.260
there was a continuity of
decorating the books with a silver

00:25:07.260 --> 00:25:15.280 position:56%
and gold illuminations and a variety
of designs were created on these.

00:25:17.150 --> 00:25:20.580
This is one of our master,

00:25:20.580 --> 00:25:29.200
scribed in gold [inaudible] namely
[inaudible], all in Indian detail

00:25:29.200 --> 00:25:33.930 position:56%
of [inaudible] and it's a catalogue.

00:25:33.930 --> 00:25:35.230
It's interesting.

00:25:35.230 --> 00:25:40.300
It starts from the city of
Ogden and Ismahen [phonetic].

00:25:40.300 --> 00:25:47.830
So, this is [inaudible] variety
of confluence of culture came up,

00:25:47.830 --> 00:25:51.520
language came up, and
then as Hirad mentioned,

00:25:51.520 --> 00:25:57.490
variety of the wonderful words not
only of Henry, Sastrick, Konert,

00:25:57.490 --> 00:26:02.960
Filbu, Bungla,[phonetic] Panjabi,
and many of this also came up.

00:26:10.320 --> 00:26:16.280
We know that paper was
not easily available

00:26:16.280 --> 00:26:21.440
after 7th century [inaudible] and
counter the Chinese paper started

00:26:21.440 --> 00:26:26.070
at summercom; then it went
to Aleppo, and from 11th

00:26:26.070 --> 00:26:31.890
and 12th century onward, with
the direction of [inaudible],

00:26:31.890 --> 00:26:36.900
the best paper for [inaudible]
was started producing in Kashmir.

00:26:36.900 --> 00:26:39.940
But apart from that, there
were many other places

00:26:39.940 --> 00:26:47.360 position:56%
where paper was produced, and the
majority of the works which we found

00:26:47.360 --> 00:26:49.160
in the treasure right
from [inaudible]

00:26:49.160 --> 00:26:52.820
until even site we can
see that the majority

00:26:52.820 --> 00:26:56.560
of the masters was
scribed in India itself.

00:26:56.560 --> 00:27:00.460
On every manuscript from
the position of book,

00:27:00.460 --> 00:27:02.620
we know that there are fly leafs,

00:27:02.620 --> 00:27:05.340
and fly leafs are really
important in many ways.

00:27:05.340 --> 00:27:07.090
And this was our suggestion
[inaudible] wanted that.

00:27:07.090 --> 00:27:10.500
Then, we destroy the
manuscripts usually

00:27:10.500 --> 00:27:14.140
with these ties only the
textual part, not the fly leaf,

00:27:14.140 --> 00:27:17.680
but the fly leafs are very
important in omission.

00:27:17.680 --> 00:27:22.280
About the pictures of the
book, itself the person

00:27:22.280 --> 00:27:24.380
who brought first time
of the possession

00:27:24.380 --> 00:27:29.080
of the programs it mentions,
it provided us the detail,

00:27:29.080 --> 00:27:32.110
also some political, and
I will show you that,

00:27:32.110 --> 00:27:37.420
so that manuscript is not only
the text but the fly leafs.

00:27:37.420 --> 00:27:40.130
Some of the notes which
are mentioned and that

00:27:40.130 --> 00:27:44.530
after that program
and [inaudible] also.

00:27:44.530 --> 00:27:46.780
This is one of the
manuscript from Gulistan

00:27:46.780 --> 00:27:49.910
of Raza Library Rampur scribed

00:27:49.910 --> 00:27:55.100
by that a known calligrapher
Sofali Machevi [phonetic].

00:27:58.800 --> 00:28:02.050
If you can see in the bottom,

00:28:02.050 --> 00:28:06.540
it is clearly mentioned
his name and Vasili.

00:28:06.540 --> 00:28:10.420
At the bottom of this corner,
you can see this is the writing

00:28:10.420 --> 00:28:17.480
of a renowned collector, a renowned
noble of the Rahim Khan-e-Khanan,

00:28:17.480 --> 00:28:23.540
and he had a moving library,
having around 5000 manuscripts

00:28:23.540 --> 00:28:30.340
with a book atlier always the
gilders, paper cutters, scribes,

00:28:30.340 --> 00:28:33.560
printers, all what
used to go with him.

00:28:33.560 --> 00:28:36.330
He established his first
library at Endoval [phonetic],

00:28:36.330 --> 00:28:40.050
second in Sanowich [phonetic],
third at Baronco [phonetic],

00:28:40.050 --> 00:28:41.990
fourth at Agrarin [phonetic].

00:28:41.990 --> 00:28:47.560
So, everywhere he used to stay,
he had a lovely [inaudible] stock,

00:28:47.560 --> 00:28:52.310
and I will show one manuscript,
which is noted in Berlin Library,

00:28:52.310 --> 00:28:56.000
decoration that he purchased that
book, written by [inaudible],

00:28:56.000 --> 00:29:05.390
printing done by [inaudible] at
the cost of 3000 rupees in 1598.

00:29:05.390 --> 00:29:11.190
This is one of the copies again
from [inaudible] on Diwan-e-Saib

00:29:11.190 --> 00:29:18.090
and an port of Jahangir and
Shah Jahan period [inaudible].

00:29:18.090 --> 00:29:23.710
And it shows that this work is
scribed by a renowned calligrapher,

00:29:23.710 --> 00:29:27.940
Shafia, and who was also
officially the [inaudible].

00:29:27.940 --> 00:29:32.710
And the seals are also
plated by these people.

00:29:32.710 --> 00:29:37.720
This is a renowned work on
the Molin [phonetic] ethics.

00:29:37.720 --> 00:29:45.800
It's also interesting that in the
telegram apart from [inaudible].

00:29:45.800 --> 00:29:48.600
From the [inaudible]
was always there,

00:29:48.600 --> 00:29:55.970 position:56%
and then the famous [inaudible] that
one person asked for [inaudible],

00:29:55.970 --> 00:30:00.590
you learned [inaudible]
ethics from home, he said,

00:30:00.590 --> 00:30:04.210
from those who don't know.

00:30:04.210 --> 00:30:10.290
So, this is one, and this is the
writings that Merdowyn [phonetic]

00:30:10.290 --> 00:30:16.100
by [inaudible], the same
one is from Jahangir

00:30:16.100 --> 00:30:21.250 position:56%
and the Ustrut [phonetic] collection
of the libraries, the seed was put

00:30:21.250 --> 00:30:26.590
up and the writing was as
[inaudible], and the signature,

00:30:26.590 --> 00:30:31.140
I told my dear friend, Hirad,
on that day that they will make

00:30:31.140 --> 00:30:36.580
like the palm of the Punjab, but
that is not the Punjab of the palm.

00:30:36.580 --> 00:30:42.130
The word is forget
[phonetic], out of humble

00:30:42.130 --> 00:30:44.610
and humility they will
just mention then

00:30:44.610 --> 00:30:47.930
to forget there is alone
means this [inaudible],

00:30:47.930 --> 00:30:51.180
the person who does
not know anything.

00:30:51.180 --> 00:30:57.050
And it says, again, from
Rampur Raza, Diwan-e-Haliz,

00:30:57.050 --> 00:31:02.020
which is recently reproduced
and published and presented

00:31:02.020 --> 00:31:05.780
to many [inaudible]
across central Asia

00:31:05.780 --> 00:31:09.640 position:56%
when our Prime Minister had visited.

00:31:09.640 --> 00:31:14.850
This is the [inaudible] of a
manuscript of Kalileh-Wa-Dimnah,

00:31:14.850 --> 00:31:20.990
scribed by an unknown scribe, so
[inaudible] and that [inaudible]

00:31:20.990 --> 00:31:24.550
and it is from the
early 16th century

00:31:24.550 --> 00:31:28.500
and [inaudible] there are two
manuscripts from this calligrapher.

00:31:28.500 --> 00:31:33.070
One is Florence and
the other is this one.

00:31:33.070 --> 00:31:35.520
A little bit hard, well, I was able

00:31:35.520 --> 00:31:39.960
to publish the whole
manuscript last year with a sort

00:31:39.960 --> 00:31:45.370
of Indian cultural concept and
this is our front page of that one,

00:31:45.370 --> 00:31:49.520 position:56%
and it was released by our Honorable
Prime Minister last year in Iran,

00:31:49.520 --> 00:31:53.920
and copies were distributed
among all the scholars free

00:31:53.920 --> 00:31:56.790
of cost at that time.

00:31:56.790 --> 00:32:01.510
It has about 120 illustrations
by Raza [phonetic],

00:32:01.510 --> 00:32:11.430
and one can also see in these
printings, which is gestured

00:32:11.430 --> 00:32:18.640
in this one, in majority of the
illustrated manuscripts, scribed

00:32:18.640 --> 00:32:22.530
and printed in Iran,
there's one discrimination.

00:32:22.530 --> 00:32:26.820
They're not filled the page square.

00:32:26.820 --> 00:32:34.980
They mix some scale type so that
it is not the full square in that,

00:32:34.980 --> 00:32:38.310
while the same is not
followed in India and either

00:32:38.310 --> 00:32:42.530
in regional or the imperial ones.

00:32:42.530 --> 00:32:46.140
This, again, the manuscript

00:32:46.140 --> 00:32:50.160
from [inaudible] are [inaudible]
a story from [inaudible].

00:32:50.160 --> 00:32:53.870
It's an 18th century
manuscript, and see the colors,

00:32:53.870 --> 00:32:57.350
and I will request
it all to compare it

00:32:57.350 --> 00:32:59.730
with our manuscript of
Shada Ama [phonetic].

00:32:59.730 --> 00:33:03.600
He has in his collection, a
Library of Congress collection,

00:33:03.600 --> 00:33:09.100
and the same high colors are
used and especially the red one

00:33:09.100 --> 00:33:12.930
and the green one, and these
can be made a comparative study

00:33:12.930 --> 00:33:16.270
of these illustrations, basically.

00:33:16.270 --> 00:33:20.280
This is an opening
photo of the same.

00:33:20.280 --> 00:33:25.380
This is again, as I said, there
are many private collections.

00:33:25.380 --> 00:33:30.180
This is a manuscript from
Hong Kong in [inaudible].

00:33:30.180 --> 00:33:37.490
They have about 270
manuscripts of various regions

00:33:37.490 --> 00:33:41.850
in the non-religious sects,
and I hope [inaudible] will be

00:33:41.850 --> 00:33:46.940
and the [inaudible] will be
successful as I persuaded them

00:33:46.940 --> 00:33:52.430
to allow the digitization
of these manuscripts.

00:33:52.430 --> 00:33:55.120
This is our last [inaudible]
of the same.

00:33:55.120 --> 00:34:03.990
Then, as I said, people which
was one of the mirror objects

00:34:03.990 --> 00:34:10.420
to create manuscripts was from the
Kashmiri, in fact, and it was used

00:34:10.420 --> 00:34:14.520
by many especially like scribe
moment of [inaudible] Kashmiri,

00:34:14.520 --> 00:34:20.300
or [inaudible], who was
also one of the transcribers

00:34:20.300 --> 00:34:23.760
and inscription writers
in [inaudible], basically.

00:34:23.760 --> 00:34:31.430 position:56%
And we had a detail in minister sell
above the paper; these are coming

00:34:31.430 --> 00:34:35.740
from where, and you know
today, in many cities,

00:34:35.740 --> 00:34:40.080
you will have a [inaudible]
or [inaudible] walla.

00:34:40.080 --> 00:34:41.650
Our colors was ours.

00:34:41.650 --> 00:34:45.700
Even though today there may be
a [inaudible] and other things

00:34:45.700 --> 00:34:49.690 position:56%
but still not the same nomenclature.

00:34:49.690 --> 00:34:53.990
Like the Ahmedabadi paper
was very glossy and stout,

00:34:53.990 --> 00:34:57.570
had a few varieties
like Bahadur Khani.

00:34:57.570 --> 00:35:01.480
Shabib Khani, well
actually, what used to happen

00:35:01.480 --> 00:35:06.410 position:56%
when [inaudible] the Emperor used to
reach in that particular locality.

00:35:06.410 --> 00:35:08.600
They will produce the
paper particularly

00:35:08.600 --> 00:35:11.930
and name that paper to him.

00:35:11.930 --> 00:35:14.230
I remember it isn't [inaudible]

00:35:14.230 --> 00:35:18.460
when through then Iran
[inaudible] second,

00:35:18.460 --> 00:35:21.090
at least [inaudible] first time,

00:35:21.090 --> 00:35:25.650
and there's a very good
market about paper production.

00:35:25.650 --> 00:35:29.340
They named after him this one.

00:35:31.070 --> 00:35:36.350
Then, as I mentioned, in the
case of the Rahim Khan-e-Khanan,

00:35:36.350 --> 00:35:43.530
all the skilled people from gildis
to warraq [phontic] or [inaudible],

00:35:43.530 --> 00:35:49.300 position:56%
all the scribe, all the printer,
all the [inaudible], all were always

00:35:49.300 --> 00:35:54.130
in the libraries, and even for
of a lack of the paper maker,

00:35:54.130 --> 00:35:59.370
their specialty works which they
had to give before the work start.

00:35:59.370 --> 00:36:04.020
In many cases, you will find
that matter is written first

00:36:04.020 --> 00:36:08.340
and the space is left for the
printing, or the vice versa too.

00:36:08.340 --> 00:36:18.470
In the [inaudible] manuscripts,
which were in the royal libraries,

00:36:18.470 --> 00:36:24.340
there were royal signets,
and many were reproduced

00:36:24.340 --> 00:36:28.480
with a highly American form.

00:36:28.480 --> 00:36:32.100
This is one of the seal with
a board water [phonetic]

00:36:32.100 --> 00:36:34.980
from early 18th century.

00:36:34.980 --> 00:36:38.250
It is a work of Miratul
Istelah of Anjman [inaudible]

00:36:38.250 --> 00:36:41.640
which I edited and
published recently.

00:36:41.640 --> 00:36:45.340
It was again published
by an Iranian publisher,

00:36:45.340 --> 00:36:49.940
a copy which I gave yesterday,
a gift to Professor Shallows.

00:36:49.940 --> 00:36:53.900
This seal starts from the top,

00:36:53.900 --> 00:36:58.600
I don't know whether you can see
my finger or not, and that one,

00:36:58.600 --> 00:37:02.220
middle one starts through the side
[inaudible] that is [inaudible].

00:37:02.220 --> 00:37:07.710
And in the middle one, the name
of the then King [inaudible]

00:37:07.710 --> 00:37:13.200
and that first one starts with
his following the cycle goes

00:37:13.200 --> 00:37:15.790
on as a generalitical table.

00:37:15.790 --> 00:37:23.420
But then, other regional areas
were moguls were not the Emperors

00:37:23.420 --> 00:37:25.990 position:56%
dictated [inaudible] kind of a seal.

00:37:25.990 --> 00:37:33.000
If the kingdom is from the
Semites, they'll write name

00:37:33.000 --> 00:37:36.300
of the [inaudible] and
on the corners name

00:37:36.300 --> 00:37:38.860
of the qualified [inaudible],
the first [inaudible].

00:37:38.860 --> 00:37:42.680
Or they will just put the flowers
or like [inaudible] in that

00:37:42.680 --> 00:37:45.220
to illuminate that with
especially the red color

00:37:45.220 --> 00:37:48.400
and especially of the documents.

00:37:48.400 --> 00:37:56.150
The majority of the
seals, like this one,

00:37:56.150 --> 00:38:00.090
as I mentioned the fly leaves
are important in they tell us

00:38:00.090 --> 00:38:03.450
about the programs and
the prices and all this,

00:38:03.450 --> 00:38:07.120
and the mention about this one.

00:38:07.120 --> 00:38:11.640
And they'll also mention the
place, like this is on the property

00:38:11.640 --> 00:38:14.580
if you can read, it is [inaudible].

00:38:14.580 --> 00:38:23.390
And also, remember, we have some
similar words for different cities,

00:38:23.390 --> 00:38:28.170
like [inaudible] was for Baka.

00:38:28.170 --> 00:38:29.770
[inaudible] also, and
we have presented

00:38:29.770 --> 00:38:33.140
but it hasn't also the
short form of [inaudible].

00:38:33.140 --> 00:38:36.910
You'll find in some scripts.

00:38:36.910 --> 00:38:41.240
This is, in fact, from
[inaudible] manuscript,

00:38:41.240 --> 00:38:44.020
and a very informative one.

00:38:44.020 --> 00:38:48.680
So, this is from Solagan
and this is [inaudible]

00:38:48.680 --> 00:38:54.710
of early mid-18th century, and
it gives a complete detail how

00:38:54.710 --> 00:39:00.490
to function used to have meetings
in the society in the ending times.

00:39:00.490 --> 00:39:03.040
Yeah, these are the fly leafs,

00:39:03.040 --> 00:39:06.390
which gives ample information
about every manuscript.

00:39:06.390 --> 00:39:10.690
You can see on the left side,
this is a note by Jahanir;

00:39:10.690 --> 00:39:14.960
middle one is by Shan
Jahan, and the middle one is

00:39:14.960 --> 00:39:18.960
by Abdur Rahim Khan-e-Khanan,
who procured this manuscript

00:39:18.960 --> 00:39:24.280
in 1998 [inaudible] after he got
[inaudible] with [inaudible],

00:39:24.280 --> 00:39:28.460
and many of these manuscripts
he procured there.

00:39:28.460 --> 00:39:33.730
Even he sent the delegation to go
out to purchase certain manuscripts

00:39:33.730 --> 00:39:36.170
which are brought by
Portuguese from Iran.

00:39:36.170 --> 00:39:43.150 position:56%
So, this kind of that will tell us
how Persian manuscripts were bought,

00:39:43.150 --> 00:39:45.400
sources of trading also.

00:39:45.400 --> 00:39:51.000
And this is again from
the Solagan one.

00:39:51.000 --> 00:39:53.310
Yeah. This is a very
dear manuscript.

00:39:53.310 --> 00:39:56.870
I hope [inaudible] and surprised.

00:39:56.870 --> 00:40:05.110
This is Nadir Shah siting on an
elephant, a manuscript from 1780s,

00:40:05.110 --> 00:40:08.660
and in state archives Allahabad.

00:40:08.660 --> 00:40:12.350
I found it, really, it
was surprising for me too.

00:40:12.350 --> 00:40:16.340
And none of Iranians have
this kind of illustration

00:40:16.340 --> 00:40:19.680
of another [inaudible], and it is
another manuscript not published

00:40:19.680 --> 00:40:23.770
yet, and it is first I mentioned
in this illustration also.

00:40:26.470 --> 00:40:32.500 position:56%
This is one of the manuscripts which
contributes some claims of scholars

00:40:32.500 --> 00:40:37.980
like Abani [phonetic], writer of
many books on the calligraphers.

00:40:37.980 --> 00:40:45.030
This method of Bostan National
Museum, Bali, scribed in 1504

00:40:45.030 --> 00:40:50.820
to 1508, and the writing is
by Abdur Rahim Khan-e-Khanan,

00:40:50.820 --> 00:40:56.870
and it tells us the seal is by
Niasiruddin of Malwa [inaudible],

00:40:56.870 --> 00:41:01.390
who ruled between 1500
to 1510 early.

00:41:01.390 --> 00:41:07.800
The manuscript is in [inaudible]
script, and it's surprising

00:41:07.800 --> 00:41:13.470
that scribe, this [inaudible] is
not mentioned in any anthology

00:41:13.470 --> 00:41:18.580
of the biographies of that
scribes, and it's from that period,

00:41:18.580 --> 00:41:21.660
and the manuscripts in
[inaudible] as you can see.

00:41:21.660 --> 00:41:24.750
And there's a premodel
[phonetic] manuscript.

00:41:24.750 --> 00:41:29.500
It has about 80 illustrations,
even one illustration

00:41:29.500 --> 00:41:36.510
from [inaudible] Temple, which is a
[inaudible] travel of [inaudible],

00:41:36.510 --> 00:41:39.810
but it's a beautiful
illustration in this one.

00:41:39.810 --> 00:41:42.300
Apart from that, there are
many other illustrations

00:41:42.300 --> 00:41:46.750
which show each story of Bostan
and but the million patterns

00:41:46.750 --> 00:41:54.010 position:56%
of this work is the work was scribed
in premodel period in the study.

00:41:54.010 --> 00:41:56.370
The work [inaudible]
with the [inaudible].

00:41:56.370 --> 00:42:00.500
Then it went to the
Museum [inaudible]

00:42:00.500 --> 00:42:03.170
and [inaudible] during
the seed of [inaudible],

00:42:03.170 --> 00:42:06.980
gifted to Abdur Rahim
Khan-e-Khanan, and he made a note

00:42:06.980 --> 00:42:10.870
on this manuscript in the bottom.

00:42:10.870 --> 00:42:13.470
This is the writing of
Abdur Rahim Khan-e-Khanan.

00:42:13.470 --> 00:42:17.040
I published this in
a separate article

00:42:17.040 --> 00:42:21.090
in a volume recently
published by Arkhan Foundation

00:42:21.090 --> 00:42:25.850
on Abdur Rahim Khan-e-Khanan,
and this [inaudible]

00:42:25.850 --> 00:42:31.620
that in they are manuscripts of
Iran that Shumsa [phonetic] is used

00:42:31.620 --> 00:42:35.050
as the seal of the library.

00:42:35.050 --> 00:42:40.420
In India, it became a fashion
that Shumsa, the opening sum

00:42:40.420 --> 00:42:45.970
of that book, showing the light is
used as the seal of the library.

00:42:45.970 --> 00:42:47.270
This is a seal.

00:42:47.270 --> 00:42:51.330
If you can't read it,
in the middle one,

00:42:51.330 --> 00:42:56.030 position:56%
it is an item by [inaudible] now
should have been [inaudible] a place

00:42:56.030 --> 00:42:59.600
of, places of scribe
is Malu [phonetic].

00:42:59.600 --> 00:43:05.020
In Malwa, which the capital at that
time of this [inaudible] in fact.

00:43:05.020 --> 00:43:09.760
So, this is, this shows that
a variety of the manuscripts

00:43:09.760 --> 00:43:12.740
in them collection
tells us the history

00:43:12.740 --> 00:43:16.970
of the various scripts started
[inaudible] there in fact.

00:43:22.440 --> 00:43:25.930
Yeah, this is a manuscript not
from Indian collection but Berlin,

00:43:25.930 --> 00:43:29.590
but I brought it here
just for the information.

00:43:29.590 --> 00:43:36.700 position:56%
The whole writing from left to right
is by Abdur Rahim Khan-e-Khanan,

00:43:36.700 --> 00:43:41.160
and he tell us how this, and I've
given the translation over here,

00:43:41.160 --> 00:43:44.590
that how this was brought in
[inaudible] from [inaudible]

00:43:44.590 --> 00:43:53.160
in three instalments, and he had
to send about 2000 to 3000 rupees

00:43:53.160 --> 00:43:58.030
to the people who are having
it in the fragments, in fact,

00:43:58.030 --> 00:44:00.250
and 1 percent where some lives.

00:44:00.250 --> 00:44:02.800
He thought that Abdur Rahim
Khan-e-Khanan will give him more

00:44:02.800 --> 00:44:08.000
money, so he started moving
from and what was on himself.

00:44:08.000 --> 00:44:12.320
But on the way, the [inaudible]
looked at this all things,

00:44:12.320 --> 00:44:16.080
and those things also, then it
became in the hands of [inaudible],

00:44:16.080 --> 00:44:18.330
and they also sold
it to someone else.

00:44:18.330 --> 00:44:23.360 position:56%
Then I came to tell him we were sent
to procure those, and at the end,

00:44:23.360 --> 00:44:29.030
Abdur Rahim Khan-e-Khanan tells
us that the work described was

00:44:29.030 --> 00:44:31.730
for [inaudible] and
[inaudible] and it took 12 years

00:44:31.730 --> 00:44:35.550
for the preservation and the
conservation by the guilders

00:44:35.550 --> 00:44:39.510
and the printers and the
scribes of the same one.

00:44:39.510 --> 00:44:43.920
Then, a writing by Shah
Jahan and a ownership seal

00:44:43.920 --> 00:44:48.090
by Auragzeb [phonetic] tells us the
manuscript has been in development,

00:44:48.090 --> 00:44:54.600 position:56%
but the middle seal again tells us
that this was a piece to [inaudible]

00:44:54.600 --> 00:44:59.890
in the collection of Abdur
Rahim Khan-e-Khan to let,

00:44:59.890 --> 00:45:05.410
but now it is in the
Library of Berlin.

00:45:05.410 --> 00:45:08.950
And it also gives the detail
because there was a [inaudible];

00:45:08.950 --> 00:45:13.240
again Abdur Rahim Khan-e-Khanan,
and he said this is the work

00:45:13.240 --> 00:45:17.880
which give this mission
and due to my, with this,

00:45:17.880 --> 00:45:26.110 position:56%
I was saved by becoming a victim, as
a conspiracy was hatched against me.

00:45:26.110 --> 00:45:29.920
So, political notes are
also in the fly leafs notes

00:45:29.920 --> 00:45:33.510 position:56%
by these nobles of the noble period.

00:45:33.510 --> 00:45:37.440
Again, the seal of the
preservation of conservation,

00:45:37.440 --> 00:45:42.310
the masters of [inaudible] National
Museum and really the [inaudible]

00:45:42.310 --> 00:45:48.570
and the Noble [inaudible]
mentioned that it became

00:45:48.570 --> 00:45:54.570
in a very dilapidated condition,
and it took us about 12 years

00:45:54.570 --> 00:45:57.970
to put it back to the level
of [inaudible] and coloration,

00:45:57.970 --> 00:46:02.160
and you can see what [inaudible]
did assure the collection

00:46:02.160 --> 00:46:07.980
of the library, and about 13
collection notes are there,

00:46:07.980 --> 00:46:13.290
which are mainly from the
[inaudible] superior in fact.

00:46:13.290 --> 00:46:17.710
Again, a variety of seals,
this is in collection history,

00:46:17.710 --> 00:46:21.240
how people were interested in
knowing the various things.

00:46:21.240 --> 00:46:25.570
These collection notes tell us
how the books were collection

00:46:25.570 --> 00:46:26.870
between then.

00:46:26.870 --> 00:46:30.330
I remember there is a book, a
manuscript and volume I see,

00:46:30.330 --> 00:46:36.120
be at our library, and the fly
leaf says, this book is mine.

00:46:36.120 --> 00:46:41.230
It'll be authenticated by the 12
persons giving their [inaudible].

00:46:41.230 --> 00:46:44.190
No one shall steal it.

00:46:44.190 --> 00:46:48.800
If he or even steal it, he will
not get place even in [inaudible].

00:46:48.800 --> 00:46:55.150
And yeah, but if he
ask to borrow it,

00:46:55.150 --> 00:46:57.700
he must bring signature
of two people.

00:46:57.700 --> 00:47:00.370
So, that when repairs
it, it has been.

00:47:00.370 --> 00:47:06.710 position:56%
Yeah, it should return to me because
this is our only work of Briston

00:47:06.710 --> 00:47:09.500
in the whole that region.

00:47:09.500 --> 00:47:14.560
This is the posity [phonetic]
of the paper, basically,

00:47:14.560 --> 00:47:15.860
which increase the [inaudible].

00:47:15.860 --> 00:47:21.960
And I got ample collection, which
gives a various description.

00:47:21.960 --> 00:47:28.480
Also, remember that they mention
that prices of the manuscripts also

00:47:28.480 --> 00:47:30.510 position:56%
and which of the currency they paid.

00:47:30.510 --> 00:47:38.570
If it is paid in [inaudible] or
home, only the coin of [inaudible],

00:47:38.570 --> 00:47:45.540
even the [inaudible], [inaudible]
first coined in [inaudible].

00:47:45.540 --> 00:47:48.610
Then went to Perjorgia, even
that time of the [inaudible]

00:47:48.610 --> 00:47:52.910
to [inaudible] but
it came into fashion

00:47:52.910 --> 00:47:55.600
in [inaudible] other
[inaudible] period,

00:47:55.600 --> 00:47:59.530
and it remained until 17th century.

00:47:59.530 --> 00:48:04.160
They mentioned that this work is
purchased at the cost of this one.

00:48:04.160 --> 00:48:10.970
Here, the numbers were written
in [inaudible] and the words also

00:48:10.970 --> 00:48:15.870
so that no one can make
any changes in that.

00:48:15.870 --> 00:48:20.320
This [inaudible] mascot and as I
mentioned some prior collection

00:48:20.320 --> 00:48:22.820
of Bhandarkar Institute.

00:48:22.820 --> 00:48:25.810
I could not take a very
good picture out of it.

00:48:25.810 --> 00:48:28.310
On that day, I hadn't my camera.

00:48:28.310 --> 00:48:30.120
I took it from some other one,

00:48:30.120 --> 00:48:33.310
but the whole [inaudible]
were eliminated,

00:48:33.310 --> 00:48:38.210
and it's why from a very
unknown part, Mobid Kashmiri,

00:48:38.210 --> 00:48:45.070
who came to [inaudible] from
Kashmiri lived 17th century.

00:48:45.070 --> 00:48:48.120
And in [inaudible] he
has given a variety

00:48:48.120 --> 00:48:54.050
of that political collections,
especially on the birth of a child,

00:48:54.050 --> 00:48:56.320
you got, it's [inaudible]
of the triplets

00:48:56.320 --> 00:49:01.370 position:56%
in many cases, and he composes that.

00:49:01.370 --> 00:49:03.880
Yeah, and I was mentioning
in my preamble

00:49:03.880 --> 00:49:08.410
that manuscripts were not
only scribed or illuminated

00:49:08.410 --> 00:49:12.480
or illustrated in the
Imperial or regional course.

00:49:12.480 --> 00:49:15.640
It's for out of that society also.

00:49:15.640 --> 00:49:17.710
This is one of the manuscripts

00:49:17.710 --> 00:49:23.710
in my own [inaudible]
library about the society.

00:49:23.710 --> 00:49:27.940
It's a body of work
whom our older works.

00:49:27.940 --> 00:49:31.830
I hope one lady from
Pakistan, I was introduced.

00:49:31.830 --> 00:49:35.010
She might be looking
on them exactly.

00:49:35.010 --> 00:49:40.820
And no one tries even to teach
that compilations here [inaudible].

00:49:40.820 --> 00:49:45.540
But today, students of the
history are working on it

00:49:45.540 --> 00:49:48.100
because the language is used.

00:49:48.100 --> 00:49:54.750
It is called unethical,
abusive, that kind of the,

00:49:54.750 --> 00:49:58.180
but the society depiction
is also there.

00:49:58.180 --> 00:50:01.570
But for the society,
both are using that kind

00:50:01.570 --> 00:50:03.790
of the language also sometimes.

00:50:03.790 --> 00:50:06.080
And here, it [inaudible] the school

00:50:06.080 --> 00:50:09.440
and the marissa [phonetic]
how the students

00:50:09.440 --> 00:50:12.360
and the teacher are
sitting in that one.

00:50:12.360 --> 00:50:14.980
And second one is more interesting.

00:50:14.980 --> 00:50:20.460
Mother-in-law took
her daughter-in-law,

00:50:20.460 --> 00:50:25.310
who is not becoming pregnant, to
this hakim, exactly what hakim was,

00:50:25.310 --> 00:50:29.770
and the astrologer also,
and she took to him

00:50:29.770 --> 00:50:32.620
to get some kind of
advice from that.

00:50:32.620 --> 00:50:37.310
So, these manuscripts show
us society, the period,

00:50:37.310 --> 00:50:41.350
and also the occupational detail.

00:50:41.350 --> 00:50:46.250
The colors which were used in
that, again, see [inaudible]

00:50:46.250 --> 00:50:49.170
that green color is used.

00:50:49.170 --> 00:50:51.060
That dark red color is used.

00:50:51.060 --> 00:50:54.700
Manuscripts is [inaudible]
like that.

00:50:54.700 --> 00:51:00.210
Then, 18th century was a
period of transition also.

00:51:00.210 --> 00:51:03.610
When ministers were created
for the new [inaudible],

00:51:03.610 --> 00:51:08.200
that is the pictures
of the European forces.

00:51:08.200 --> 00:51:13.300
Maps were taken and the pictures
are; then, European techniques,

00:51:13.300 --> 00:51:16.080
and this is one of the
manuscripts, Chahar Gulshan,

00:51:16.080 --> 00:51:19.070
which I published in 2011.

00:51:19.070 --> 00:51:22.750
It has maps from Decan
[phonetic] up to [inaudible].

00:51:22.750 --> 00:51:27.460
There are three other
details, and as for that,

00:51:27.460 --> 00:51:31.970
some scholars of geography and the
cartography, this is a first work

00:51:31.970 --> 00:51:36.820
on European cartographical
styles and effect.

00:51:36.820 --> 00:51:41.840
Then, again, this is from

00:51:41.840 --> 00:51:44.310
in National Museum Delhi.

00:51:44.310 --> 00:51:49.360
Now, there are some who wrote
the work, transcribed the work,

00:51:49.360 --> 00:51:53.570
and printed the work; he's a
single person, Mullah [inaudible].

00:51:53.570 --> 00:52:01.260
He has beautifully illustrated
this manuscript, he has given all

00:52:01.260 --> 00:52:04.960
with idea of the subjects in
this one, from the good life

00:52:04.960 --> 00:52:08.470
to the one, to the hunting also.

00:52:08.470 --> 00:52:11.430
Hunting only with the ladies.

00:52:11.430 --> 00:52:18.180
And here, the French Ambassador
is being received in the Fort

00:52:18.180 --> 00:52:19.740
of the Goolgooda [phonetic],

00:52:19.740 --> 00:52:25.180
and the whole city map is
there, in fact, if you can see.

00:52:25.180 --> 00:52:28.510
And the dresses of, one
dress I was being shown

00:52:28.510 --> 00:52:30.750

00:52:30.750 --> 00:52:34.800
Now, I'm showing you this
one, and this show, this one.

00:52:34.800 --> 00:52:41.460
This is the [inaudible] manuscript,
which tell us about the market

of Mathura and Ojen [phonetic].

00:52:43.710 --> 00:52:45.010
People are selling.

00:52:45.010 --> 00:52:46.310
You can eat it.

00:52:46.310 --> 00:52:50.150
[Inaudible] fed to cannibals, what
[inaudible] fed to kind of sell off

00:52:50.150 --> 00:52:59.100
that portion or dealing in the
paper, and this is the one when,

00:52:59.100 --> 00:53:02.920
again, tradition that
loud cry was given.

00:53:02.920 --> 00:53:08.550
The rights of the collection or
the text is by Shahalam in 1751,

00:53:08.550 --> 00:53:11.530
and from the time when
the history changes,

00:53:11.530 --> 00:53:16.230
and there's the post
decline, a resulting effect.

00:53:16.230 --> 00:53:21.910
This is the works of another
text on the music one, as I said,

00:53:21.910 --> 00:53:25.470
when I give a subject, and
four other Vernaculo words.

00:53:25.470 --> 00:53:27.690
You can see that script is Persian,

00:53:27.690 --> 00:53:31.880
but the words are not the Persian
language, and this is a thing

00:53:31.880 --> 00:53:37.480
which has to be done, and we
usually call it a Persian,

00:53:37.480 --> 00:53:41.540
but not the Persian words.

00:53:41.540 --> 00:53:47.210
Persian was dethroned in 1837
by [inaudible] but Persian

00:53:47.210 --> 00:53:50.040
and India continued until 1940s.

00:53:50.040 --> 00:53:56.450 position:56%
This is one of the sample I'm giving
and from a non-Muslim ruling class

00:53:56.450 --> 00:54:00.690
from [inaudible], which shows that
until 1911, even I have a document

00:54:00.690 --> 00:54:05.870
from 1943 that they are
showing that the communications

00:54:05.870 --> 00:54:10.120
between the various
chieftans was in Persian.

00:54:10.120 --> 00:54:14.170
You can see the gold
seals also on this one.

00:54:14.170 --> 00:54:23.930
This is one of a manuscript which
tells us a word is used on many

00:54:23.930 --> 00:54:27.780
of the manuscripts when
in location, Yak bi kaj.

00:54:27.780 --> 00:54:35.330
It kind of a pub, which was
missing from by various scholar

00:54:35.330 --> 00:54:41.860
that it is a kind of ant as being
used by antidote for the others;

00:54:41.860 --> 00:54:47.650
but now it is a hub one can see and
[inaudible] also or the dictionary

00:54:47.650 --> 00:54:52.190
of the medicine plants, published
in three volumes from Tehran.

00:54:52.190 --> 00:54:57.190
This is a hub, and it is
used on many manuscripts

00:54:57.190 --> 00:55:03.700
with a notation, God
may save this book.

00:55:03.700 --> 00:55:10.410
So, with this, I conclude
this brief detail

00:55:10.410 --> 00:55:13.560
on various collections
of Persian manuscripts.

00:55:13.560 --> 00:55:15.570
Apart from it, I even mentioned

00:55:15.570 --> 00:55:18.660
that it is not only Persian
manuscripts in India.

00:55:18.660 --> 00:55:23.430
We have in Islamic scripts
manuscripts in Turkish.

00:55:23.430 --> 00:55:25.670
We recently published

00:55:25.670 --> 00:55:28.860
from [inaudible] Library Rampur
collection and the catalogue

00:55:28.860 --> 00:55:30.410
of the Turkish manuscripts.

00:55:30.410 --> 00:55:36.150
We have manuscripts in
African, a lot, a lot,

00:55:36.150 --> 00:55:40.200
that I gave them [inaudible] have
these [inaudible], which are,

00:55:40.200 --> 00:55:47.490
have been put up and the divisions
have been published in India.

00:55:47.490 --> 00:55:51.390
Likewise in [inaudible] also.

00:55:51.390 --> 00:55:52.690
[Inaudible] also.

00:55:52.690 --> 00:55:54.210
[Inaudible] in Islamic script also.

00:55:54.210 --> 00:55:56.810
Kashmiri in Islamic script also.

00:55:56.810 --> 00:56:05.760
These are in abundance in India,
but there is a [inaudible] decrees

00:56:05.760 --> 00:56:12.660
in the script knowing
people of this huge campus,

00:56:12.660 --> 00:56:18.860
and we are facing the problem as
you are also facing about this one,

00:56:18.860 --> 00:56:23.910
and especially about the
documents which are in huge number,

00:56:23.910 --> 00:56:31.020
really huge number, but we need
students, who should come forward.

00:56:31.020 --> 00:56:35.230
We will provide all the
detail and the help to them.

00:56:35.230 --> 00:56:38.790
Unfortunately, the Indian
government announced

00:56:38.790 --> 00:56:41.310
that whoever will do
period in Persian

00:56:41.310 --> 00:56:46.190
from outside the [inaudible] will
not recognized by the Ministry,

00:56:46.190 --> 00:56:49.660
so people are stopped
coming from there.

00:56:49.660 --> 00:56:51.880
They are doing Buddhist studies.

00:56:51.880 --> 00:56:54.040
They are doing something else.

00:56:54.040 --> 00:56:57.670
Bring, there are accepting
the Persian sources,

00:56:57.670 --> 00:57:02.450
but they cannot get the deal in
Persian studies, unfortunately.

00:57:02.450 --> 00:57:04.280
But this, this is not a complaint.

00:57:04.280 --> 00:57:05.720
This is their own policy;
we cannot enforce it.

00:57:05.720 --> 00:57:07.520
Thanks.

00:57:07.520 --> 00:57:12.110
[ Audience Applause ]

00:57:12.110 --> 00:57:13.410
&gt;&gt; Hirad Dinavari:
Thank you very much.

00:57:13.410 --> 00:57:14.710
That was a wonderful talk.

00:57:14.710 --> 00:57:16.010
That was fantastic.

00:57:16.010 --> 00:57:17.310
Thank you, but before you
leave, in the beginning,

00:57:17.310 --> 00:57:19.650
you gave some statistics, and
you used the Indie word "luck,"

00:57:19.650 --> 00:57:22.800
Luck is exactly how many
thousands for folks we don't see?

00:57:22.800 --> 00:57:24.210
&gt;&gt; Chander Shekhar:
Hundred thousand.

00:57:24.210 --> 00:57:26.960
&gt;&gt; Hirad Dinavari: So, if you
were to, Hackmein [inaudible],

00:57:26.960 --> 00:57:30.050
if you were to give some sort of
an estimate, how many hundreds

00:57:30.050 --> 00:57:31.350 position:56%
of thousands of books would you say?

00:57:31.350 --> 00:57:33.400
&gt;&gt; Chander Shekhar:
Half million, I said.

00:57:33.400 --> 00:57:34.750
&gt;&gt; Hirad Dinavari: Of
Persian manuscripts?

00:57:34.750 --> 00:57:36.050
&gt;&gt; Chander Shekhar: Yes.

00:57:36.050 --> 00:57:37.350
&gt;&gt; Hirad Dinavari: And
this is not even --

00:57:37.350 --> 00:57:40.120 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Chander Shekhar: And they're four
times more than the document forms.

00:57:40.120 --> 00:57:43.220
If you see, and if you
have time, I can show you

00:57:43.220 --> 00:57:45.960
about 1000 documents right here.

00:57:45.960 --> 00:57:47.260
&gt;&gt; Hirad Dinavari: I understand.

00:57:47.260 --> 00:57:51.690 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Chander Shekhar: Because I've
collected in this trail of 40 years.

00:57:51.690 --> 00:57:56.080
Wherever I have been
in various collections,

00:57:56.080 --> 00:58:00.880
I tried to get a picture
for my own knowledge.

00:58:00.880 --> 00:58:02.180
&gt;&gt; Hirad Dinavari: Right.

00:58:02.180 --> 00:58:03.480
Now, this is manuscripts.

00:58:03.480 --> 00:58:05.700
Lithographs and early imprints,
how much would you say?

00:58:05.700 --> 00:58:07.160
That's the other category.

00:58:07.160 --> 00:58:08.920
&gt;&gt; Chander Shekhar: I have
published a book on that.

00:58:08.920 --> 00:58:15.990
Novel just shows 1896
list and 2000, right.

00:58:15.990 --> 00:58:21.920
Because printing press had come
in India in 16th century, 1582,

00:58:21.920 --> 00:58:25.250
brought by the Portuguese,
and then it was shifted

00:58:25.250 --> 00:58:29.210 position:56%
because there was infighting between
various missionaries [inaudible]

00:58:29.210 --> 00:58:32.790
because it was brought
by the [inaudible].

00:58:32.790 --> 00:58:36.350
Recently, I talked and
I studied [inaudible].

00:58:36.350 --> 00:58:40.890
That was something [inaudible]
get written by [inaudible].

00:58:40.890 --> 00:58:50.290
Give a picture of the Imperial
a musician to [inaudible],

00:58:50.290 --> 00:58:52.070
and that's what its claim.

00:58:52.070 --> 00:58:55.710
The book was presented to
Jung [inaudible] himself,

00:58:55.710 --> 00:58:58.990
but we don't find any
comment by Jung [inaudible],

00:58:58.990 --> 00:59:02.190
even in [inaudible]
to Jung [inaudible].

00:59:02.190 --> 00:59:05.820
But from that time, this
printing press has come,

00:59:05.820 --> 00:59:11.160
majority of the books were used
also for the missionary purpose.

00:59:11.160 --> 00:59:14.990
In that 18th century, when this
[inaudible] Collier established

00:59:14.990 --> 00:59:20.680
in Calcutta, majority of the books
were published for that [inaudible]

00:59:20.680 --> 00:59:23.440
for that eastern their
company officers.

00:59:23.440 --> 00:59:27.750
And from then, not only
the non-illustrated,

00:59:27.750 --> 00:59:33.230
illustrated ones also, and even
I think in Library of Congress

00:59:33.230 --> 00:59:34.650
and there's some other place else,

00:59:34.650 --> 00:59:40.350
where you have highly illustrated
letter printing ones also.

00:59:40.350 --> 00:59:48.520
I remember, [inaudible] only it was
by [inaudible] has been prepared.

00:59:48.520 --> 00:59:54.260
It's text and published
from Calcutta,

00:59:54.260 --> 00:59:58.900
but later on another
manuscript from Puna was prepared

00:59:58.900 --> 01:00:03.070
by the Russian Society of them,
and they also edit about 10

01:00:03.070 --> 01:00:09.330
to 12 folios prior to the
text about their faith,

01:00:09.330 --> 01:00:14.700
about all those [inaudible]
of Puna in that manuscript.

01:00:14.700 --> 01:00:16.560
So, they published it.

01:00:16.560 --> 01:00:19.030
It really work illustration.

01:00:19.030 --> 01:00:24.960 position:56%
So, little one was adopted because
it can reproduce the handwritten one

01:00:24.960 --> 01:00:28.690
in the same form from
first it was in the stones.

01:00:28.690 --> 01:00:33.040
We have still got stones used by
[inaudible] in one collection.

01:00:33.040 --> 01:00:38.980
And little [inaudible] until 1996,

01:00:38.980 --> 01:00:43.520
all they are doing Arabic
newspapers were published

01:00:43.520 --> 01:00:46.460
from that little technology
in India.

01:00:46.460 --> 01:00:50.960
My father let, they went to Seoul

01:00:50.960 --> 01:00:54.980
who brought me this
[inaudible] Persian studies

01:00:54.980 --> 01:00:58.790
by the older [inaudible] who
worked with [inaudible] long way

01:00:58.790 --> 01:01:02.890
from the [inaudible] and shifted
to [inaudible] and he was always

01:01:02.890 --> 01:01:05.210
on the, this [inaudible].

01:01:05.210 --> 01:01:07.560
And we had in our own family,

01:01:07.560 --> 01:01:11.070
collection from really
early [inaudible].

01:01:11.070 --> 01:01:15.460
So, letter was but now letter
become again a manuscript.

01:01:15.460 --> 01:01:17.370
Hard to remember.

01:01:17.370 --> 01:01:20.870 position:56%
Masters have not only the
handwritten because in the other way

01:01:20.870 --> 01:01:23.430
that letter is also handwritten.

01:01:23.430 --> 01:01:29.270
Only thing that we could,
[inaudible] more easily than one

01:01:29.270 --> 01:01:30.880
than with the handwritten one.

01:01:30.880 --> 01:01:33.960
So, that there's another scope

01:01:33.960 --> 01:01:39.770
of work [inaudible] how does letter
interestingly and book writing,

01:01:39.770 --> 01:01:44.200 position:56%
one can write script, but in letter,
it is [inaudible], [inaudible]

01:01:44.200 --> 01:01:47.140
and then it has to be printed.

01:01:47.140 --> 01:01:49.550
&gt;&gt; Hirad Dinavari: It has
to be printed, exactly.

01:01:49.550 --> 01:01:50.870
Again, this can go on
and on [inaudible],

01:01:50.870 --> 01:01:52.660
as we say, the story continues.

01:01:52.660 --> 01:01:57.770
So, there is many, you know,
angles from which you could look

01:01:57.770 --> 01:02:01.980
at the Persian publishing in
India, but I want to open the floor

01:02:01.980 --> 01:02:03.320
up for about three questions.

01:02:03.320 --> 01:02:06.330
We are already over
our one hour allotment.

01:02:06.330 --> 01:02:08.510
[Inaudible], go ahead.

01:02:08.510 --> 01:02:11.600
[ Inaudible Speaker ]

01:02:11.600 --> 01:02:12.900
&gt;&gt; Speak up.

01:02:12.900 --> 01:02:14.210
&gt;&gt; Can you give some a mike to her?

01:02:14.210 --> 01:02:16.010
&gt;&gt; We don't have one.

01:02:16.010 --> 01:02:59.360
[ Inaudible Speaker ]

01:02:59.360 --> 01:03:01.050
&gt;&gt; Hirad Dinavari: Okay.

01:03:01.050 --> 01:03:05.060
Please speak here so
that we can record.

01:03:05.060 --> 01:03:07.910
Essentially, the question
was about seals

01:03:07.910 --> 01:03:09.710
and the various kinds of seals.

01:03:09.710 --> 01:03:11.700
&gt;&gt; Chander Shekhar: They
were the [inaudible]

01:03:11.700 --> 01:03:15.010
and they were given
these kind of [inaudible]

01:03:15.010 --> 01:03:19.950
of the titles in the various times.

01:03:19.950 --> 01:03:26.550
I will send you a copy of my paper
on From the Pain of [inaudible]

01:03:26.550 --> 01:03:31.690
or you can also read yourself
[inaudible] who speaks

01:03:31.690 --> 01:03:35.390
about three persons
who were [inaudible]

01:03:35.390 --> 01:03:41.010
of Abdur Rahim Khan-e-Khanan and
also later on became [inaudible].

01:03:41.010 --> 01:03:44.580
These were the titles basically.

01:03:44.580 --> 01:03:49.480
This [inaudible] who was
a well-known poet also,

01:03:49.480 --> 01:03:56.810
and one works of him that really,

01:03:56.810 --> 01:04:01.400
[inaudible] which is really
stand attributed [inaudible]

01:04:01.400 --> 01:04:04.060
so after someone else, but
this works is from him.

01:04:04.060 --> 01:04:07.500
And there is a manuscript
of this collection

01:04:07.500 --> 01:04:09.300
at the Museum New Delhi also.

01:04:09.300 --> 01:04:11.910
But basically, these
other titles given

01:04:11.910 --> 01:04:14.190
on the various times
[inaudible] is also title.

01:04:14.190 --> 01:04:15.490
It is not his name.

01:04:15.490 --> 01:04:25.680
&gt;&gt; You referred at the very end
to the fact that studying Persian

01:04:25.680 --> 01:04:30.810
in India may not be
acknowledged in mainland Iran

01:04:30.810 --> 01:04:36.200
because they basically think of
it as a kind of an offshoot there.

01:04:36.200 --> 01:04:43.150
But outside Iran, there is a lot
of interest in the Persian network.

01:04:43.150 --> 01:04:48.470
All these different constellations
or cultures which are very vibrant,

01:04:48.470 --> 01:04:52.700
and they have Persian in there
and so that was not surprising

01:04:52.700 --> 01:04:55.090
because I'm sure you
know and all that.

01:04:55.090 --> 01:05:00.290
Is there a way that
there could be, you know,

01:05:00.290 --> 01:05:04.340
kind of why would it be
illegitimized by one country?

01:05:04.340 --> 01:05:09.070
There should be ways
of coming together

01:05:09.070 --> 01:05:15.660 position:56%
to make this a legitimate study of
Persians, based on what is available

01:05:15.660 --> 01:05:20.920
to you and the scholars that are
there in India, in Central Asia.

01:05:20.920 --> 01:05:28.840
So, do you see anything like
that happening in India?

01:05:28.840 --> 01:05:30.140
&gt;&gt; Chander Shekhar:

01:05:30.140 --> 01:05:34.500
We have [inaudible] Committee
union catalogue not only

01:05:34.500 --> 01:05:39.520
of the Indian collection like
Dr. Mosavi [phonetic] did it

01:05:39.520 --> 01:05:42.280
for the Pakistan's manuscript,

01:05:42.280 --> 01:05:48.760
or recently like [inaudible]
published a collection

01:05:48.760 --> 01:05:51.070
of all Persian prints [inaudible].

01:05:51.070 --> 01:05:59.410
Problem is that scholars, even
if they want to do the work,

01:05:59.410 --> 01:06:03.590
the holders do not allow that.

01:06:03.590 --> 01:06:11.220
This is the way it's going on
amongst master [inaudible] in Delhi

01:06:11.220 --> 01:06:15.320
and some other parts also,
especially the private holders.

01:06:15.320 --> 01:06:23.150
They do not want to part with their
things, even they sometimes resist

01:06:23.150 --> 01:06:28.130
that they should not
touch the manuscripts.

01:06:28.130 --> 01:06:32.960
It is just a feeling
of the possessiveness.

01:06:32.960 --> 01:06:35.750
They don't know everything
has a life.

01:06:35.750 --> 01:06:41.120
It is a human being of the
manuscripts, but it is a feeling,

01:06:41.120 --> 01:06:44.430
and this is a major hurdle
in creating this kind

01:06:44.430 --> 01:06:46.990
of a union catalogue, basically.

01:06:46.990 --> 01:06:52.700 position:56%
Many times we see, like I have shown
you this [inaudible] manuscript,

01:06:52.700 --> 01:06:58.040
and when I saw this first time,
[inaudible] a letter to [inaudible]

01:06:58.040 --> 01:07:00.740
and it has mentioned
about this manuscript,

01:07:00.740 --> 01:07:03.980
but I don't know how he missed
this point in this manuscript,

01:07:03.980 --> 01:07:06.430
and he didn't read
the fly leaf note.

01:07:06.430 --> 01:07:10.380
He just went on the straight
[inaudible] because, as I said,

01:07:10.380 --> 01:07:15.100
fly leaf marks are very
much important about these.

01:07:15.100 --> 01:07:22.330
But there should be more to give
and make a comprehensive report

01:07:22.330 --> 01:07:26.080 position:56%
on variety of this work [inaudible].

01:07:26.080 --> 01:07:29.480
But it's not a simple
thing, in fact.

01:07:29.480 --> 01:07:32.150
You can make a project
but implement.

01:07:32.150 --> 01:07:35.210
Some of the things is
a little bit difficult.

01:07:35.210 --> 01:07:37.730
&gt;&gt; Hirad Dinavari: Last question.

01:07:37.730 --> 01:07:39.030
[inaudible]

01:07:39.030 --> 01:07:40.330
&gt;&gt; Chander Shekhar: Yeah, please.

01:07:40.330 --> 01:07:41.630
&gt;&gt; Right. First of
all, thank you so much.

01:07:41.630 --> 01:07:44.890
I've learned so much
from your presentation,

01:07:44.890 --> 01:07:46.480
and I heard [inaudible].

01:07:46.480 --> 01:07:53.460
Again, I'm not [inaudible]
expert and so I wanted to ask you

01:07:53.460 --> 01:08:01.430 position:56%
if someone like me, a lay person,
were looking at a Persian manuscript

01:08:01.430 --> 01:08:08.360
in India, what would you say
would be the major characteristic

01:08:08.360 --> 01:08:11.790
that would differentiate it
from a manuscript [inaudible]

01:08:11.790 --> 01:08:16.130
in Iran, for example, in Persia?

01:08:16.130 --> 01:08:23.660 position:56%
What would be the five or six things
that I should be looking at and say,

01:08:23.660 --> 01:08:28.100
okay, this is a manuscript
made in India?

01:08:29.120 --> 01:08:30.780
&gt;&gt; Chander Shekhar:
Very good question.

01:08:30.780 --> 01:08:37.170
I will need some time, I
hope you will give that.

01:08:37.170 --> 01:08:39.830 position:56%
There were two types of the scribes,

01:08:39.830 --> 01:08:44.620
one who had the mother tongue
language, means the Iranians,

01:08:44.620 --> 01:08:47.710
of the Persians because of the
Personite world who arrived

01:08:47.710 --> 01:08:52.100
in India, and the other other
one, who acquired this language,

01:08:52.100 --> 01:08:55.130
especially the comers
of the non-Muslims,

01:08:55.130 --> 01:08:57.600
who acquired this language
for various reasons,

01:08:57.600 --> 01:09:00.630
not only for their job seeking
burlesque also [inaudible].

01:09:00.630 --> 01:09:08.640 position:56%
One can make a very good distinction
between these two groups.

01:09:08.640 --> 01:09:16.100
The first group would write
the manuscript in the form

01:09:16.100 --> 01:09:18.600
which is prevalent in
their, back in their country

01:09:18.600 --> 01:09:21.590
and more [inaudible] one.

01:09:21.590 --> 01:09:25.310
The second group, in
spite of the fact

01:09:25.310 --> 01:09:27.970
that they were the best
calligraphers also.

01:09:27.970 --> 01:09:33.310
They were not any, many of them
like Charlie von Bremer [phonetic]

01:09:33.310 --> 01:09:35.050
who you can [inaudible]
industry has worked.

01:09:35.050 --> 01:09:38.850
He was one of the best
calligraphers.

01:09:38.850 --> 01:09:42.340
They learned calligraphy
for two reasons.

01:09:42.340 --> 01:09:48.290
All of world edits weren't
written by the best calligraphers,

01:09:48.290 --> 01:09:51.700
and one was writing, a
single foreman also was

01:09:51.700 --> 01:09:53.760
like a privilege for him.

01:09:53.760 --> 01:10:01.120
So, they tried to reach
to that stage [inaudible].

01:10:01.120 --> 01:10:04.140
These people when scribing
the manuscript,

01:10:04.140 --> 01:10:11.280 position:56%
especially on some [inaudible] they
will create the spellings especially

01:10:11.280 --> 01:10:15.290
closer to the natural
position of the word.

01:10:15.290 --> 01:10:23.550
While a non-Iranian was a
non-Indian scribe will try

01:10:23.550 --> 01:10:30.170
to scribe the word as he has heard.

01:10:30.170 --> 01:10:34.870
The reason is it is just the
hearing one and the best example

01:10:34.870 --> 01:10:40.990
of this hearing and writing use
dictionary Hopson and Jobson.

01:10:40.990 --> 01:10:44.800
I hope every one of you know that.

01:10:44.800 --> 01:10:52.650
No? Hopson and Jobson is a
dictionary and it in 1896 compiled

01:10:52.650 --> 01:10:55.990
on the basis of all the
messages he collected

01:10:55.990 --> 01:11:01.110
from various bishop s[phonetic]
from east he shared with India.

01:11:01.110 --> 01:11:09.260 position:56%
And in the hearing one, he got, many
words he got, which were misspelled

01:11:09.260 --> 01:11:12.750
or which are mispronounced
but it is arguing, well,

01:11:12.750 --> 01:11:18.440 position:56%
the two words which he got from Bali
that were lost, Hopson and Jobson,

01:11:18.440 --> 01:11:21.690
and the detail was that
in a particular month,

01:11:21.690 --> 01:11:27.420
we are hitting two
words in a possession,

01:11:27.420 --> 01:11:31.230
and the detail is there
is a possession

01:11:31.230 --> 01:11:39.290
and people are beating their chest
and saying, Hopson and Jobson.

01:11:39.290 --> 01:11:42.890
The word is Yahusson
[phonetic] and Yahusson,

01:11:42.890 --> 01:11:46.030
but they are hearing
Hopson and Jobson.

01:11:46.030 --> 01:11:53.140
In the similar way, describes
whatever they were hearing.

01:11:53.140 --> 01:12:00.440 position:56%
I gave one example yesterday that an
Iranian scholar who wrote an entry

01:12:00.440 --> 01:12:08.380
and the word alias was presumed
to be a Persian word, and he read,

01:12:08.380 --> 01:12:11.390
wrote, Moman Husein
Kharm [phonetic].

01:12:11.390 --> 01:12:13.170
Ilias is for Kharm.

01:12:13.170 --> 01:12:15.480
Ilias is an English word.

01:12:15.480 --> 01:12:17.160
He thought it was a Persian word.

01:12:17.160 --> 01:12:20.700
So, similar such mass
level of editors,

01:12:20.700 --> 01:12:23.380
and this is one of the reasons.

01:12:23.380 --> 01:12:30.650
To find out our own Indie
word what is a transposition

01:12:30.650 --> 01:12:34.560
in Persian manuscripts is
difficult for ourselves.

01:12:34.560 --> 01:12:38.670
What was a true position, then
we have to concert the transcript

01:12:38.670 --> 01:12:42.270
of the all your books, and
then we try to find out.

01:12:42.270 --> 01:12:48.350
This is one of the areas
from which you can find out.

01:12:48.350 --> 01:12:51.230
Then, the illustrations,
as I have shown you,

01:12:51.230 --> 01:12:56.180
they will try to reproduce
these illustrations of variety

01:12:56.180 --> 01:13:02.400
of the people of the lower class
especially in the same attire,

01:13:02.400 --> 01:13:07.090
giving the same kind of older
man's, all these things.

01:13:07.090 --> 01:13:09.340
Then also the buildings.

01:13:09.340 --> 01:13:16.400
This is their reading
of them and [inaudible].

01:13:16.400 --> 01:13:22.450
Apart from all this,
somewhere you will find

01:13:22.450 --> 01:13:26.980
that signs of their faith also.

01:13:26.980 --> 01:13:33.520
Many of the non-Muslims relied
in the beginning, [inaudible]

01:13:33.520 --> 01:13:35.640 position:56%
but many will just like [inaudible].

01:13:35.640 --> 01:13:40.880
They look like this [inaudible].

01:13:40.880 --> 01:13:44.620
So, this is, they created
their own way.

01:13:44.620 --> 01:13:52.970
Like in India, a Muslim will
call a Muslim [inaudible]

01:13:52.970 --> 01:13:59.860
but if he's admitting a
non-Muslim, he will say of others.

01:13:59.860 --> 01:14:02.850
So, of others?

01:14:02.850 --> 01:14:04.150
&gt;&gt; Adapt me.

01:14:04.150 --> 01:14:05.450
Adopt.

01:14:05.450 --> 01:14:07.900
&gt;&gt; Chander Shekhar: So,
society created certain kind

01:14:07.900 --> 01:14:15.100
of [inaudible] themselves, and
in some cases it's difficult

01:14:15.100 --> 01:14:18.270
because many Indian
non-Muslim writers,

01:14:18.270 --> 01:14:22.650
like in this Mobits [phonetic]
manuscript, it's really difficult

01:14:22.650 --> 01:14:27.770
to make out whether this Persian
is combined in any of an Indian.

01:14:27.770 --> 01:14:30.510
But you get somewhere
form these things.

01:14:30.510 --> 01:14:35.280
[ Audience Applause ]

01:14:35.280 --> 01:14:36.880
&gt;&gt; Hirad Dinavari: And
thank you to all again.

01:14:36.880 --> 01:14:38.430
Again, thanks.

01:14:38.430 --> 01:14:40.790
Thank you everyone for coming,
and thank you to the University

01:14:40.790 --> 01:14:45.360
of Maryland, to Asian Division,
John, and everyone, thanks again.

01:14:45.360 --> 01:14:48.280
