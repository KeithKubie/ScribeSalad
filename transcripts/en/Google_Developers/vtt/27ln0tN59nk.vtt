VAIDEESWARAN
SETHURAMAN: Divum has

00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:09.710
been started by me and Sree.

00:00:09.710 --> 00:00:11.190
Sree is my wife.

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:13.400
She carries a lot of
passion for startups,

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:16.219
and I carry a lot of
passion for technology.

00:00:16.219 --> 00:00:20.370
We provide services in the areas
of design, cloud, and mobile.

00:00:20.370 --> 00:00:24.640
Divum Labs was set up to build
a single primary product called

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:25.430
Terraa.

00:00:25.430 --> 00:00:28.050
Terraa is an online
grocery mobile application.

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:30.390
It's available on both
iPhone and Android.

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:33.840
People can browse hundreds of
products available over there,

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:35.390
and they can place an order.

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:38.690
So when we were brainstorming
about Terraa last year,

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:40.320
we looked at the
overall industry

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:42.880
Several players were
upcoming in the grocery

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:46.310
space, and we [INAUDIBLE]
a lot of problems

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:48.500
to be solved in this area.

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:51.110
That's where the Google
Developer Agency Program

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:53.475
helped a lot in terms
of bringing awareness

00:00:53.475 --> 00:00:56.107
of what are the best practices.

00:00:56.107 --> 00:00:57.940
VISHNU GOVINDASAMI: The
two major challenges

00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:00.290
that were thrown to
the Terraaa tech team

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:03.088
was scalability and
building dataset.

00:01:03.088 --> 00:01:04.879
KRISHNA SL: We have
been constantly looking

00:01:04.879 --> 00:01:06.830
for opportunities
to work with Google.

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:08.340
We were totally
convinced of using

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:10.470
Google Stack right from
backend, the frontend,

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:11.760
and our analytics.

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:14.230
And the programs like
Google Developer Agency

00:01:14.230 --> 00:01:16.117
was the right fit
to bridge this gap.

00:01:16.117 --> 00:01:18.200
And the support from Google
when we hit roadblocks

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:19.774
was tremendous.

00:01:19.774 --> 00:01:21.440
VISHNU GOVINDASAMI:
When the opportunity

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:24.060
was presented by the Google
Developer Agency Program

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:26.300
to meet the Firebase
team, we really got

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:28.770
to know all how deeply
the Firebase is also

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:30.700
integrated with the App Engine.

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:33.770
And it was easy for us
to make the communication

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:34.937
between these two platforms.

00:01:34.937 --> 00:01:37.270
KRISHNA SL: App Engine with
the combination of DataStore

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:39.690
was the best possible option
for us to scale [INAUDIBLE]

00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:41.212
from day one.

00:01:41.212 --> 00:01:43.580
With the concept of
Firebase that we had,

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:46.690
we had seamless synchronization
of inventory, cart,

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:48.630
and location tracking
of the drivers.

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:50.380
VISHNU GOVINDASAMI:
Three major advantages

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:52.170
of the Developer
Agency Program--

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:55.520
first one is the online training
courses that they provided us.

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:59.670
Second is the material design
training that they provided us.

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:01.580
And third one is all
the opportunities

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:04.610
that they provided us to
meet the Firebase core team.

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:06.110
VAIDEESWARAN
SETHURAMAN: Sree and me

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:10.430
used to spend a lot of hours
and hours discussing technology.

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:13.290
So both of us, we always
want to do something crazy,

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:17.010
we want to adapt all the
technologies at once.

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:18.770
That's where Google
Developer Agency

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:20.366
Program came at the right time.

00:02:20.366 --> 00:02:21.740
And they are
continuously working

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:24.680
towards building disruptive
technologies and disruptive

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:25.290
solutions.

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:28.420
Terraa make motivation
for us to work.

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:30.920
VISHNU GOVINDASAMI: We expect
a lot more training coming up,

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:34.790
and also a lot more insights
into the latest technologies.

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:37.950
We are really looking forward
to continuing this relationship.

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:41.300
