MARC DE SCHWEINITZ:
Welcome to Talks at Google.

00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:08.930
I'm Mark de Schweinitz.

00:00:08.930 --> 00:00:10.330
I'm here with Tom McPhee.

00:00:10.330 --> 00:00:11.584
Tom, thanks for joining us.

00:00:11.584 --> 00:00:13.000
TOM MCPHEE: Oh,
my pleasure, Mark.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.235
I actually came
bearing gifts, too.

00:00:15.235 --> 00:00:17.917
I know you can't see
it in front of here.

00:00:17.917 --> 00:00:20.250
But I wanted to really thank
you because I do appreciate

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:23.890
you giving me this opportunity
and just the friendship

00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:25.250
that we've started to develop.

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:26.270
I appreciate that.

00:00:26.270 --> 00:00:30.139
This is what got me
started in this whole field

00:00:30.139 --> 00:00:30.930
in the first place.

00:00:30.930 --> 00:00:33.263
So I want to give you have
copy of my movie "An American

00:00:33.263 --> 00:00:33.806
Opera."

00:00:33.806 --> 00:00:35.264
MARC DE SCHWEINITZ:
Wow, thank you.

00:00:35.264 --> 00:00:36.080
That's awesome.

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:37.538
I'm definitely
going to watch this.

00:00:37.538 --> 00:00:39.766
I'm a big documentary fan,
so I look forward to that.

00:00:39.766 --> 00:00:40.740
TOM MCPHEE: Thanks.

00:00:40.740 --> 00:00:41.781
MARC DE SCHWEINITZ: Good.

00:00:41.781 --> 00:00:44.560
Well, Tom and I first
met about a year ago.

00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:47.280
It was at a Google
for Nonprofits.

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:48.360
I was a volunteer.

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:50.910
Tom was here in the
office at Ann Arbor.

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:53.300
And I saw a video
of what he does.

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:58.840
It was a about himself running
down Gratiot Avenue in Detroit,

00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:02.850
documenting dogs and the
problems that some of them

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:06.410
are facing based on abuse
and other problems like that.

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:08.210
I was impressed by
what you did, Tom.

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:09.484
So thanks for coming.

00:01:09.484 --> 00:01:10.650
TOM MCPHEE: Oh, my pleasure.

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:13.185
And I can't believe
it's been, seriously,

00:01:13.185 --> 00:01:15.050
a year since that took place.

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:17.134
Was it really last
fall, last late fall?

00:01:17.134 --> 00:01:19.050
MARC DE SCHWEINITZ: Yeah,
something like that.

00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:20.550
TOM MCPHEE: Oh, my goodness.

00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:20.810
MARC DE SCHWEINITZ: Yeah.

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:22.990
And what we really want
to learn about today

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:28.220
is what you do as a filmmaker,
making documentaries like this,

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:30.050
and how we can learn
as Googlers and others

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:33.689
watching how to tell great
stories through video,

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:34.730
and other ways like that.

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:36.340
So first, maybe you
could just tell us

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:39.630
what you do in general as
a documentary filmmaker?

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:41.450
TOM MCPHEE: Well,
I'm kind of, I think,

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:42.892
a very contemporary hybrid.

00:01:42.892 --> 00:01:46.770
I've been fancying about
the whole independent film

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:49.120
scene for a long time.

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:54.090
I actually started my
career in technology.

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:57.370
I worked for Hamilton Avnet
and then Avnet Computer.

00:01:57.370 --> 00:01:59.622
And I [INAUDIBLE]
big-box computers

00:01:59.622 --> 00:02:02.920
coupled with really
expensive software.

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:06.332
That afforded me to get involved
with creating my own software

00:02:06.332 --> 00:02:08.956
company in the early '90s.

00:02:08.956 --> 00:02:14.600
And the whole reason for me was
to get closer to film-making.

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:17.895
And initially, for many
years, that process

00:02:17.895 --> 00:02:23.390
was making interactive content
for commercial entities

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:27.560
like Ford and Saturn and
so on here in a car town.

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:29.120
But I always wanted
to be involved

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:32.098
with the more commercial
or the more available

00:02:32.098 --> 00:02:34.462
form of entertainment.

00:02:34.462 --> 00:02:37.511
And I like documentaries
a lot, too.

00:02:37.511 --> 00:02:40.614
But I was able to make
some independent films.

00:02:40.614 --> 00:02:42.670
I was able to create
an independent film

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:46.770
tour called Flicks Tour that
toured around the country.

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:51.640
We actually helped, in
essence, find Paul Feig.

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:54.714
Paul Feig, who now just got
"Ghostbusters" that's coming

00:02:54.714 --> 00:02:56.490
out, he did "Bridesmaids."

00:02:56.490 --> 00:03:00.370
He did "Spy."

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:02.962
His coming out was
"Freaks and Geeks."

00:03:02.962 --> 00:03:05.830
And he wrote that while he was
on my film tour, the Flicks

00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:07.725
Tour, at that time.

00:03:07.725 --> 00:03:11.500
And Kevin Smith actually
started doing his college

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:16.340
touring because he appeared at
a couple of our presentations

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:18.295
with Flicks Tour on
the college circuit.

00:03:18.295 --> 00:03:20.900
And we were always
mobbed when he was there.

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:24.542
Now he's making, like, $50,000
and up per three hours.

00:03:24.542 --> 00:03:26.000
MARC DE SCHWEINITZ:
That'd be nice.

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:26.958
TOM MCPHEE: Oh, I know.

00:03:26.958 --> 00:03:27.470
It's crazy.

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:29.810
But for me, I was
really fascinated

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:35.280
with telling stories and
being able to communicate.

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:38.540
I always thought I was going
to be a baseball player.

00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:42.330
Since I couldn't be a baseball
player forever, what do you do?

00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:47.510
And as a storyteller, I can
tell stories all my life.

00:03:47.510 --> 00:03:49.510
You know, the rest of my life.

00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:52.680
In this realm, though, I'm
telling stories visually.

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:56.470
It has been a 25-year
journey for me

00:03:56.470 --> 00:04:00.000
to go from producer hiring
people and interacting

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:01.293
with people to make movies.

00:04:01.293 --> 00:04:05.560
The very first movie I made
was with Bruce Campbell.

00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:07.010
It was a little
independent film.

00:04:07.010 --> 00:04:09.070
I don't know if people
know horror films.

00:04:09.070 --> 00:04:12.470
And we just lost Gunnar Hansen,
who was the original "Texas

00:04:12.470 --> 00:04:14.440
Chainsaw Massacre" leatherface.

00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:16.866
But he was our
star in our movie.

00:04:16.866 --> 00:04:18.931
When you're doing
a horror film, you

00:04:18.931 --> 00:04:21.019
need to have some kind of icon.

00:04:21.019 --> 00:04:23.050
But Gunnar just passed away.

00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:24.260
Rest his soul.

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:29.790
But I went from that
to going through a book

00:04:29.790 --> 00:04:32.330
should gyrations of
trying to understand what

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:34.590
I wanted to do in this realm.

00:04:34.590 --> 00:04:40.820
And in 2005, as soon as
Hurricane Katrina hit

00:04:40.820 --> 00:04:42.940
and everything took
place there, I'd

00:04:42.940 --> 00:04:45.954
been doing this type of
stuff for 15, 20 years.

00:04:45.954 --> 00:04:48.972
And I found myself being in--

00:04:48.972 --> 00:04:50.180
MARC DE SCHWEINITZ: This one?

00:04:50.180 --> 00:04:53.015
TOM MCPHEE: That's right
--in New Orleans immediately

00:04:53.015 --> 00:04:53.515
afterwards.

00:04:53.515 --> 00:04:55.378
We thought we were
going to help people.

00:04:55.378 --> 00:04:59.150
And a very specific moment
in time sort of flashed.

00:04:59.150 --> 00:05:00.974
It literally just happened.

00:05:00.974 --> 00:05:04.890
And I saw the next three to
five years in front of me.

00:05:04.890 --> 00:05:09.050
And that was-- I
thought I was seeing

00:05:09.050 --> 00:05:13.790
our evolutionary
essence, how we evolve.

00:05:13.790 --> 00:05:18.060
In front my eyes, in this
catastrophic environment,

00:05:18.060 --> 00:05:20.510
people were trying to do good.

00:05:20.510 --> 00:05:23.130
So you had a bunch of people
trying to do good with people.

00:05:23.130 --> 00:05:25.670
But then you had
this mass of humanity

00:05:25.670 --> 00:05:29.100
that came down to try to
do good with animals, too.

00:05:29.100 --> 00:05:33.190
And when I started to look at
how this whole thing played

00:05:33.190 --> 00:05:38.710
out, I thought, this is
amazing because the facade

00:05:38.710 --> 00:05:41.430
of everything and what
we are was ripped away.

00:05:41.430 --> 00:05:45.190
And you could actually
see people's essence

00:05:45.190 --> 00:05:46.561
in their humanity.

00:05:46.561 --> 00:05:49.620
And I thought it was
the perfect opportunity

00:05:49.620 --> 00:05:54.530
to figure out a way to
spend time with this realm,

00:05:54.530 --> 00:05:59.135
to tell stories, and, for
me, uncover our evolution

00:05:59.135 --> 00:06:06.150
in real time-- not in the
future looking back at us,

00:06:06.150 --> 00:06:06.857
but right now.

00:06:06.857 --> 00:06:07.440
What do we do?

00:06:07.440 --> 00:06:09.689
MARC DE SCHWEINITZ: So this
film, "An American Opera,"

00:06:09.689 --> 00:06:14.273
is about people saving their
pets after Hurricane Katrina?

00:06:14.273 --> 00:06:15.160
Is that correct?

00:06:15.160 --> 00:06:19.330
TOM MCPHEE: Well, actually,
it's about the disaster

00:06:19.330 --> 00:06:20.900
within a disaster.

00:06:20.900 --> 00:06:25.410
And what happened was in this
disaster, about three days,

00:06:25.410 --> 00:06:28.155
four days into it, there
was a fourth evacuation

00:06:28.155 --> 00:06:31.370
because people hadn't left for
a lot of different reasons.

00:06:31.370 --> 00:06:34.010
And many of those
people, a huge portion

00:06:34.010 --> 00:06:37.980
of the population, because
they can't take their pets.

00:06:37.980 --> 00:06:41.490
And so when they were
forced to evacuate,

00:06:41.490 --> 00:06:44.876
they were forcibly
separated from their pets.

00:06:44.876 --> 00:06:46.625
And there were literally
tens of thousands

00:06:46.625 --> 00:06:49.485
of animals of all
sorts left behind.

00:06:49.485 --> 00:06:52.456
And there was all kinds
of really horrific things

00:06:52.456 --> 00:06:53.330
happening there, too.

00:06:53.330 --> 00:06:55.580
I know we've heard
about the situation

00:06:55.580 --> 00:06:57.930
with the people being
gunned down on the bridge.

00:06:57.930 --> 00:07:01.030
But in St. Bernard Parish,
for two whole days,

00:07:01.030 --> 00:07:03.920
the police were going
up and down the streets

00:07:03.920 --> 00:07:05.402
shooting everybody's dogs.

00:07:05.402 --> 00:07:09.540
They actually sent out
texts to their fellow--

00:07:09.540 --> 00:07:11.949
because in those
situations, firemen,

00:07:11.949 --> 00:07:13.740
police around the world
help band together,

00:07:13.740 --> 00:07:14.690
hey, what do you need?

00:07:14.690 --> 00:07:17.120
And there's texts of
the police going, hey,

00:07:17.120 --> 00:07:18.144
we need more bullets.

00:07:18.144 --> 00:07:20.602
We ran out of bullets shooting
all the dogs in the streets.

00:07:20.602 --> 00:07:21.180
MARC DE SCHWEINITZ:
Oh, that's terrible.

00:07:21.180 --> 00:07:24.280
TOM MCPHEE: And it's a story
that people don't really

00:07:24.280 --> 00:07:24.780
realize.

00:07:27.327 --> 00:07:28.160
And I didn't either.

00:07:28.160 --> 00:07:30.754
And this is the
thing that kind of

00:07:30.754 --> 00:07:34.730
cauterized this or kind
of made this real for me.

00:07:34.730 --> 00:07:39.280
And that is the fact that there
is this soul-bond connection

00:07:39.280 --> 00:07:40.770
with people, with animals.

00:07:40.770 --> 00:07:42.239
They're family members.

00:07:42.239 --> 00:07:47.020
And you can't just-- so you
things go wrong at that point

00:07:47.020 --> 00:07:51.462
when you try to
separate families.

00:07:51.462 --> 00:07:54.100
MARC DE SCHWEINITZ: So when
you went down to Louisiana

00:07:54.100 --> 00:07:55.480
after this disaster,
did you know

00:07:55.480 --> 00:07:57.595
that you'd be
making a documentary

00:07:57.595 --> 00:07:58.800
about this incident?

00:07:58.800 --> 00:07:58.940
TOM MCPHEE: No.

00:07:58.940 --> 00:08:00.030
MARC DE SCHWEINITZ: Or you
just went down and said,

00:08:00.030 --> 00:08:01.595
this is something
terrible happening.

00:08:01.595 --> 00:08:03.470
I need to figure out
how I can help here?

00:08:03.470 --> 00:08:07.960
TOM MCPHEE: We heard Mayor Nagin
basically pleading for help

00:08:07.960 --> 00:08:14.790
on that September 1, like a
couple days after the storm.

00:08:14.790 --> 00:08:17.170
And he was pleading
for assistance,

00:08:17.170 --> 00:08:19.630
in essence crying on the radio.

00:08:19.630 --> 00:08:21.460
And I heard this a
couple days later

00:08:21.460 --> 00:08:23.300
when I was getting ready
for something else.

00:08:23.300 --> 00:08:26.830
And I just felt like I
have to do something.

00:08:26.830 --> 00:08:29.620
I'm at a moment in time
I can go address this.

00:08:29.620 --> 00:08:31.360
I'm going to go down there.

00:08:31.360 --> 00:08:33.966
We thought we were going
to be helping pull people,

00:08:33.966 --> 00:08:37.299
dead bodies out of
the-- I had no concept

00:08:37.299 --> 00:08:39.767
about animal-related--
oh, this is a new world.

00:08:39.767 --> 00:08:41.767
MARC DE SCHWEINITZ: So
this was, really, a foray

00:08:41.767 --> 00:08:43.510
into animal-related film?

00:08:43.510 --> 00:08:44.820
TOM MCPHEE: Absolutely.

00:08:44.820 --> 00:08:46.250
MARC DE SCHWEINITZ: And
this was about 10 years ago?

00:08:46.250 --> 00:08:46.873
TOM MCPHEE: Yes.

00:08:46.873 --> 00:08:47.831
MARC DE SCHWEINITZ: OK.

00:08:47.831 --> 00:08:49.980
TOM MCPHEE: When it
happened, when I went down,

00:08:49.980 --> 00:08:52.355
it was early September, 2005.

00:08:52.355 --> 00:08:56.180
And I had been doing this
type of production, producer,

00:08:56.180 --> 00:08:57.226
and so on.

00:08:57.226 --> 00:09:00.450
But I ended up participating
on two Animal Planet

00:09:00.450 --> 00:09:03.216
specials about the event,
a National Geographic

00:09:03.216 --> 00:09:12.885
special, and Nova, their
natural history series.

00:09:12.885 --> 00:09:15.980
It was on there, too.

00:09:15.980 --> 00:09:19.190
And they were looking at
certain aspects of the story.

00:09:19.190 --> 00:09:21.600
And I was seeing a much
richer story down there.

00:09:21.600 --> 00:09:23.350
And so I wanted to
tell the greater story.

00:09:23.350 --> 00:09:26.202
And that's why the
movie came out of it,

00:09:26.202 --> 00:09:27.910
because there was
quite a bit of material

00:09:27.910 --> 00:09:30.460
that I participated in.

00:09:30.460 --> 00:09:35.380
I needed to tell my story, what
I saw, this ongoing situation.

00:09:35.380 --> 00:09:38.100
Once all the dogs, in
essence, or animals,

00:09:38.100 --> 00:09:41.386
were scattered about, as
people were fostering them

00:09:41.386 --> 00:09:46.410
around the country, and then
people were working behind

00:09:46.410 --> 00:09:48.387
the scenes around
the country going,

00:09:48.387 --> 00:09:50.220
oh, I couldn't have
been there, but maybe we

00:09:50.220 --> 00:09:52.790
can help reunite
animals, then you

00:09:52.790 --> 00:09:56.670
had this mass of people
trying to find these dogs.

00:09:56.670 --> 00:09:59.630
And so our photographs,
about 10,000

00:09:59.630 --> 00:10:03.210
of them that we shot immediately
when we got down there

00:10:03.210 --> 00:10:07.220
were used to start to put all
the people and animals back

00:10:07.220 --> 00:10:08.330
together.

00:10:08.330 --> 00:10:10.431
And then you had a
whole other disaster

00:10:10.431 --> 00:10:11.972
because the people
who were fostering

00:10:11.972 --> 00:10:14.472
didn't want to give
the animals back.

00:10:14.472 --> 00:10:17.480
They go, oh, these people
left those animals.

00:10:17.480 --> 00:10:19.624
They shouldn't have them.

00:10:19.624 --> 00:10:20.790
So there was so many things.

00:10:20.790 --> 00:10:23.310
There were so many layers going
onto this, and the humanity.

00:10:23.310 --> 00:10:31.250
And again, it created a whole
bunch of content for history.

00:10:31.250 --> 00:10:34.490
"An American Opera" and all
of its contents, by the way,

00:10:34.490 --> 00:10:37.980
is going into the
Library of Congress.

00:10:37.980 --> 00:10:41.880
And it was a very
important period of time.

00:10:41.880 --> 00:10:44.838
The animal welfare and
animal rescue realm

00:10:44.838 --> 00:10:46.380
really blew up at that point.

00:10:46.380 --> 00:10:50.430
There's two contributing
factors-- social media,

00:10:50.430 --> 00:10:54.290
because Facebook, Craig's
List was a huge impact

00:10:54.290 --> 00:10:55.820
on that environment.

00:10:55.820 --> 00:10:59.620
And then this event,
this massive event

00:10:59.620 --> 00:11:02.200
that people saw unfold
on their-- they had

00:11:02.200 --> 00:11:06.148
seen five years before-- 9/11.

00:11:06.148 --> 00:11:07.680
Oh, my god.

00:11:07.680 --> 00:11:09.650
What do you do
after-- and here, they

00:11:09.650 --> 00:11:13.180
watched this event unfold
over a couple days.

00:11:13.180 --> 00:11:16.360
And they go, that's close
enough that I can drive there.

00:11:16.360 --> 00:11:19.610
Even if they're somewhere in
Quebec or Washington state,

00:11:19.610 --> 00:11:21.990
people were driving
there to help out,

00:11:21.990 --> 00:11:23.145
and tens of thousands.

00:11:23.145 --> 00:11:28.360
And I was part of
that collective

00:11:28.360 --> 00:11:32.397
that was down there that
had those experiences

00:11:32.397 --> 00:11:34.355
and then had those
experiences for many months.

00:11:34.355 --> 00:11:36.790
Then I interacted with
a lot of those people

00:11:36.790 --> 00:11:40.470
again to watch their evolution.

00:11:40.470 --> 00:11:42.270
And it's been amazing.

00:11:42.270 --> 00:11:44.791
Just this year, they had
the 10-year anniversary.

00:11:44.791 --> 00:11:47.040
And again, there were 10-year
anniversary [INAUDIBLE].

00:11:47.040 --> 00:11:49.520
I was filming something else,
so I couldn't go this year,

00:11:49.520 --> 00:11:52.412
but I filmed a bunch of
five-year reunion stuff.

00:11:52.412 --> 00:11:53.120
I was down there.

00:11:53.120 --> 00:11:55.317
I was actually down
there at that time

00:11:55.317 --> 00:12:00.500
covering the BP disaster
in the Gulf for WA2S Films.

00:12:00.500 --> 00:12:03.175
So that's what kind of
initiated everything.

00:12:03.175 --> 00:12:05.250
And then a publisher
friend of mine

00:12:05.250 --> 00:12:09.607
said, hey, we really want to
get behind what you're doing.

00:12:09.607 --> 00:12:11.190
And we think we can
get behind it more

00:12:11.190 --> 00:12:13.032
if you started a nonprofit.

00:12:13.032 --> 00:12:15.177
And I thought about that.

00:12:15.177 --> 00:12:16.635
And I said, aw,
that's a good idea.

00:12:16.635 --> 00:12:18.801
I'd love to just because I
don't want to go and fund

00:12:18.801 --> 00:12:20.230
each individual thing.

00:12:20.230 --> 00:12:23.320
We need to be able to figure
out how to create an entity

00:12:23.320 --> 00:12:24.677
to fund all the things.

00:12:24.677 --> 00:12:26.260
I want to be able
to be in a situation

00:12:26.260 --> 00:12:30.610
where our organization
can, at six hours notice

00:12:30.610 --> 00:12:33.780
after a major disaster,
go off into that disaster.

00:12:33.780 --> 00:12:34.730
I was at BP.

00:12:34.730 --> 00:12:35.900
We were in Fukushima.

00:12:35.900 --> 00:12:39.150
We were in Haiti studying
the relationships and stuff.

00:12:41.447 --> 00:12:43.155
This publisher friend
of mine said, look,

00:12:43.155 --> 00:12:45.050
you need to do this.

00:12:45.050 --> 00:12:46.994
And I thought about it.

00:12:46.994 --> 00:12:48.600
I said, OK.

00:12:48.600 --> 00:12:50.500
And then I told her the name.

00:12:50.500 --> 00:12:52.610
She was like, what's that?

00:12:52.610 --> 00:12:53.830
Like, because it's so long.

00:12:53.830 --> 00:12:55.680
MARC DE SCHWEINITZ: The World
Animal Awareness Society?

00:12:55.680 --> 00:12:57.850
TOM MCPHEE: Yeah, it's a
mouthful and a half, right?

00:12:57.850 --> 00:13:01.936
She was like, why don't you
just call it, like, Dogville?

00:13:01.936 --> 00:13:02.770
It's like, well, no.

00:13:02.770 --> 00:13:04.602
I want it to do something
a little bit more.

00:13:04.602 --> 00:13:06.545
We don't want to do just
funny animal things.

00:13:06.545 --> 00:13:09.042
We want to do stuff that's
really meaningful here.

00:13:09.042 --> 00:13:10.583
And unfortunately,
I want to pack all

00:13:10.583 --> 00:13:12.882
of what we do into that name.

00:13:12.882 --> 00:13:15.507
So, World Animal
Awareness Society,

00:13:15.507 --> 00:13:18.312
which says exactly what we are.

00:13:18.312 --> 00:13:20.770
MARC DE SCHWEINITZ: And what's
the goal of the World Animal

00:13:20.770 --> 00:13:21.700
Awareness Society?

00:13:21.700 --> 00:13:23.370
TOM MCPHEE: To be
able to tell stories

00:13:23.370 --> 00:13:26.510
that [INAUDIBLE] human-animal
interaction to try

00:13:26.510 --> 00:13:29.050
to understand our
evolutionary arc.

00:13:29.050 --> 00:13:32.390
I mean, it really boils down
to that simple of a thing.

00:13:32.390 --> 00:13:38.330
And our URL, which is an homage
to Ann Arbor, too, is wa2s.org.

00:13:38.330 --> 00:13:42.170
Anybody who knows Ann Arbor
knows it's A2 or A-squared.

00:13:42.170 --> 00:13:45.986
Our A-squared is
Animal Awareness.

00:13:45.986 --> 00:13:47.430
So it's wa2s.org.

00:13:49.397 --> 00:13:50.480
MARC DE SCHWEINITZ: Great.

00:13:50.480 --> 00:13:53.730
So before we learn
more about wa2s.org,

00:13:53.730 --> 00:13:57.230
can you share with us how you
develop a story, such as when

00:13:57.230 --> 00:13:59.310
you made "An American Opera"?

00:13:59.310 --> 00:14:02.530
What was your
process for saying,

00:14:02.530 --> 00:14:05.020
in a 45-minute, an
hour-long documentary,

00:14:05.020 --> 00:14:07.770
here is the
start-to-finish of a story?

00:14:07.770 --> 00:14:10.670
Just more for education
for our viewers,

00:14:10.670 --> 00:14:12.130
how do you tell a
story like that?

00:14:12.130 --> 00:14:14.200
TOM MCPHEE: I appreciate that.

00:14:14.200 --> 00:14:15.880
I've been doing this
a long time now.

00:14:15.880 --> 00:14:18.470
I'm starting to figure out
all the different processes

00:14:18.470 --> 00:14:20.520
and how to use what I'm doing.

00:14:20.520 --> 00:14:22.785
And you asked me early on
about being a filmmaker.

00:14:22.785 --> 00:14:24.785
I think I'm a contemporary
filmmaker because I'm

00:14:24.785 --> 00:14:26.380
making for the internet.

00:14:26.380 --> 00:14:28.140
I making for commercial.

00:14:28.140 --> 00:14:30.930
I'm making for
television, theatrical.

00:14:30.930 --> 00:14:32.690
And so they're all different.

00:14:32.690 --> 00:14:37.280
But they all kind of
contribute to each other.

00:14:37.280 --> 00:14:40.140
A lot of filmmakers don't really
understand that, by the way.

00:14:40.140 --> 00:14:47.760
I love, love, love YouTube,
Google, the Google family.

00:14:47.760 --> 00:14:52.010
It's been a great partnership
with Google Nonprofit.

00:14:52.010 --> 00:14:54.930
And YouTube is just
such a powerful entity

00:14:54.930 --> 00:14:56.890
to be able to create
my own channel

00:14:56.890 --> 00:15:00.630
and be able to communicate
what's going on in the world.

00:15:00.630 --> 00:15:04.601
It's been truly phenomenal.

00:15:04.601 --> 00:15:09.000
But for me, there has
been this evolution.

00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:12.110
And I think it starts
with understanding,

00:15:12.110 --> 00:15:13.710
where's your target?

00:15:13.710 --> 00:15:15.630
And then, what's your medium?

00:15:15.630 --> 00:15:20.249
And so that whole idea of,
are we really targeting

00:15:20.249 --> 00:15:20.790
the internet?

00:15:20.790 --> 00:15:24.952
Are we targeting--
"The Martian" looks

00:15:24.952 --> 00:15:27.660
very different than
"An American Opera."

00:15:27.660 --> 00:15:30.602
There's a whole different thing
in terms of cost and everything

00:15:30.602 --> 00:15:32.200
that goes into it.

00:15:32.200 --> 00:15:36.160
And so for me, as a
documentary filmmaker,

00:15:36.160 --> 00:15:39.050
I don't want to
create the construct.

00:15:39.050 --> 00:15:41.190
I want you observe the world.

00:15:41.190 --> 00:15:44.820
And then I want to assemble
based on what I've seen

00:15:44.820 --> 00:15:47.910
and what I've assimilated
of that information.

00:15:47.910 --> 00:15:50.430
"An American Opera," I was
just talking about this

00:15:50.430 --> 00:15:53.836
with somebody recently ago.

00:15:53.836 --> 00:15:58.465
When do you get into being able
to talk about facts and figures

00:15:58.465 --> 00:15:59.860
with a documentary?

00:15:59.860 --> 00:16:03.050
When is it a good
situation to look

00:16:03.050 --> 00:16:06.060
at maybe the emotional
aspects of the storytelling?

00:16:06.060 --> 00:16:09.640
And for "An American Opera,"
because the facts weren't

00:16:09.640 --> 00:16:12.480
known, it was such
a big crazy mess

00:16:12.480 --> 00:16:16.060
that you couldn't really sort
through what was going on.

00:16:16.060 --> 00:16:19.270
And the emotions
took huge precedence.

00:16:19.270 --> 00:16:23.846
The idea was here we just
happened to be at ground zero

00:16:23.846 --> 00:16:24.970
when those things happened.

00:16:24.970 --> 00:16:26.910
And you start to kind
of work your way out.

00:16:26.910 --> 00:16:28.310
OK, where are the story threads?

00:16:28.310 --> 00:16:28.977
What's going on?

00:16:28.977 --> 00:16:30.851
That's when we found
that the dogs were being

00:16:30.851 --> 00:16:32.480
murdered in St. Bernard Parish.

00:16:32.480 --> 00:16:35.190
That's when we find that
people are [INAUDIBLE].

00:16:35.190 --> 00:16:39.740
That's when we go chase
after Marilyn Pickens,

00:16:39.740 --> 00:16:42.490
[INAUDIBLE] Pickens'
wife, was flying dogs out

00:16:42.490 --> 00:16:46.360
by the Airbus load.

00:16:46.360 --> 00:16:49.196
So we went down to the
airport, and we're filming.

00:16:49.196 --> 00:16:52.940
You go, oh, there's
something going on here.

00:16:52.940 --> 00:16:56.070
And you start to
kind of expand out.

00:16:56.070 --> 00:16:58.590
So that's how
"American Opera" went.

00:16:58.590 --> 00:17:00.380
When I look at
doing doc projects,

00:17:00.380 --> 00:17:05.460
though, I want to
take that process.

00:17:05.460 --> 00:17:08.109
And the reason is
because every time

00:17:08.109 --> 00:17:11.640
that I started to go and
examine these things,

00:17:11.640 --> 00:17:14.569
my brain starts to tell me,
oh, this is what I'm seeing.

00:17:14.569 --> 00:17:15.569
This is what I'm seeing.

00:17:15.569 --> 00:17:16.535
This is kind of
what I'm looking at.

00:17:16.535 --> 00:17:19.470
And as I look at it more, it's
like, oh, no, no, no, no, no.

00:17:19.470 --> 00:17:20.829
There's something else going on.

00:17:20.829 --> 00:17:24.170
There's another layer that
we've got to peel back.

00:17:24.170 --> 00:17:28.200
And time-- and I
appreciate doing long form,

00:17:28.200 --> 00:17:31.510
but I'm started to
specialize in short form,

00:17:31.510 --> 00:17:32.570
too, for the internet.

00:17:32.570 --> 00:17:34.690
We shot something
yesterday afternoon.

00:17:34.690 --> 00:17:36.505
It's on the top
of our page right

00:17:36.505 --> 00:17:40.570
now-- wa2s.org-- a bunch of
puppies and dogs being rescued.

00:17:40.570 --> 00:17:41.930
It's a five-minute piece.

00:17:41.930 --> 00:17:43.370
We flipped it around.

00:17:43.370 --> 00:17:47.620
We're trying to understand
how to best do look and feel

00:17:47.620 --> 00:17:51.400
and aesthetic and tell a
story and connect with that.

00:17:51.400 --> 00:17:53.760
And for us, it also
helps boil down

00:17:53.760 --> 00:17:56.112
what might work in a
television piece, what might

00:17:56.112 --> 00:17:58.390
work in a film festival piece.

00:17:58.390 --> 00:18:01.770
And they're different.

00:18:01.770 --> 00:18:05.880
So I've started to look
at how can we just shoot

00:18:05.880 --> 00:18:09.560
as much as we can, and
then start to chase

00:18:09.560 --> 00:18:10.790
after the different threads.

00:18:10.790 --> 00:18:13.520
And the ones that stick to each
other, you put them together.

00:18:13.520 --> 00:18:15.020
MARC DE SCHWEINITZ:
So your approach

00:18:15.020 --> 00:18:16.485
is really go gather the--

00:18:16.485 --> 00:18:17.360
TOM MCPHEE: Oh, yeah.

00:18:17.360 --> 00:18:18.220
MARC DE SCHWEINITZ:
--information,

00:18:18.220 --> 00:18:20.000
just see what's
happening, and then

00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:22.894
figure out what's the
story here as opposed

00:18:22.894 --> 00:18:26.042
to coming in with a
pre-determined plan, structure.

00:18:26.042 --> 00:18:27.500
TOM MCPHEE: One of
the first things

00:18:27.500 --> 00:18:30.110
that we did with
World Animal Awareness

00:18:30.110 --> 00:18:36.300
Society was make a presentation
to Rotary in Saline, Michigan.

00:18:36.300 --> 00:18:40.390
And I exclaimed what--
and people can you

00:18:40.390 --> 00:18:42.580
find it on our YouTube channel.

00:18:42.580 --> 00:18:45.570
There's a three-part thing
about why we're doing it.

00:18:45.570 --> 00:18:47.735
And for me, it's
about documentum.

00:18:47.735 --> 00:18:49.610
MARC DE SCHWEINITZ:
Documentum, what is that?

00:18:49.610 --> 00:18:52.600
TOM MCPHEE: It's kind
of the Latin from where

00:18:52.600 --> 00:18:54.510
"documentary" comes
from. "Documentary"

00:18:54.510 --> 00:18:58.830
is a very contemporary word,
like maybe 100 years old or so.

00:19:01.455 --> 00:19:04.770
And it's really come forth
with the moving image.

00:19:04.770 --> 00:19:08.162
But going back 2,000 years or
more, the idea of a documentum

00:19:08.162 --> 00:19:15.150
is telling stories in essence to
learn from, stories to educate,

00:19:15.150 --> 00:19:20.320
to pass on knowledge to
allow you to move forward,

00:19:20.320 --> 00:19:21.960
progressively, happily.

00:19:21.960 --> 00:19:27.736
There's idea of documentum,
just saying what happens.

00:19:27.736 --> 00:19:29.452
And a lot of times,
with documentaries,

00:19:29.452 --> 00:19:34.070
especially now, we're
trying to confect too much.

00:19:34.070 --> 00:19:36.600
And my belief is, and
the whole reason I

00:19:36.600 --> 00:19:39.970
started this was to try to cut
through all of that stuff, all

00:19:39.970 --> 00:19:43.100
the static, to figure
out what's real,

00:19:43.100 --> 00:19:47.705
what is really going on here
and not what they're selling me

00:19:47.705 --> 00:19:49.246
or not what this
place is selling me.

00:19:49.246 --> 00:19:51.534
I want to know really
what the deal is.

00:19:51.534 --> 00:19:53.450
MARC DE SCHWEINITZ: Is
this a belief you have?

00:19:53.450 --> 00:19:57.140
Or is it shared amongst
all of the main documentary

00:19:57.140 --> 00:19:57.740
filmmakers?

00:19:57.740 --> 00:20:00.383
When you go to a Sundance
Film Festival or something

00:20:00.383 --> 00:20:03.755
like that, do you share
this belief with others?

00:20:03.755 --> 00:20:06.150
TOM MCPHEE: I think it all
depends on-- sometimes,

00:20:06.150 --> 00:20:08.660
but I think it all depends
on how successful you are.

00:20:08.660 --> 00:20:12.970
I love watching all
different-- and looking

00:20:12.970 --> 00:20:15.100
at all different-- types
of documentary filmmakers

00:20:15.100 --> 00:20:16.680
for all different
types of reasons.

00:20:16.680 --> 00:20:20.516
I like Michael Moore just for
how commercially successful

00:20:20.516 --> 00:20:22.290
that guy is.

00:20:22.290 --> 00:20:22.966
Amazing.

00:20:22.966 --> 00:20:25.550
Now some of his work has
been really phenomenal, too,

00:20:25.550 --> 00:20:27.362
in terms of how he's
digging up stuff.

00:20:27.362 --> 00:20:29.980
But that's a certain
type of documentary.

00:20:29.980 --> 00:20:32.982
Then you've got Alex Gibney,
who's won some Oscars.

00:20:32.982 --> 00:20:35.680
And he's got a very
specific look to him.

00:20:35.680 --> 00:20:38.880
Morgan Spurlock's got a look.

00:20:38.880 --> 00:20:40.610
I've got a lot of
people that I'm

00:20:40.610 --> 00:20:43.715
interacting with in the
filmmaking community.

00:20:43.715 --> 00:20:48.310
And they all kind of-- hey, some
focus in rock documentaries,

00:20:48.310 --> 00:20:50.460
so it kind of has that flavor.

00:20:50.460 --> 00:20:52.920
But everything is evolving
because right now the tools

00:20:52.920 --> 00:20:54.738
are evolving.

00:20:54.738 --> 00:21:00.752
We're not working with-- the
fact that I can be-- sorry,

00:21:00.752 --> 00:21:06.450
but I'm killing my mic, too--
an opposite brain person

00:21:06.450 --> 00:21:08.640
coming from the
sales side of things,

00:21:08.640 --> 00:21:11.845
to be able to now
really kind of fully

00:21:11.845 --> 00:21:13.925
make the adjustment to
be a creative person

00:21:13.925 --> 00:21:19.570
is because the tools exist--
the digital tools, the cameras.

00:21:19.570 --> 00:21:22.772
I'm going to bring this up now
so I don't forget about it.

00:21:22.772 --> 00:21:24.820
I wanted to have some
of our filmmaking

00:21:24.820 --> 00:21:29.010
have a much more
dynamic look to it.

00:21:29.010 --> 00:21:30.622
And so we're using drones.

00:21:30.622 --> 00:21:32.080
MARC DE SCHWEINITZ:
That's awesome.

00:21:32.080 --> 00:21:34.810
TOM MCPHEE: This is
DJI's Inspire 1. ?

00:21:34.810 --> 00:21:36.561
It's super easy to use.

00:21:36.561 --> 00:21:37.894
MARC DE SCHWEINITZ: Easy to fly?

00:21:37.894 --> 00:21:38.858
No accidents?

00:21:38.858 --> 00:21:39.755
Crashing here?

00:21:39.755 --> 00:21:45.160
TOM MCPHEE: Well, this is the
second one. [LAUGHTER] However,

00:21:45.160 --> 00:21:46.220
they are super easy.

00:21:46.220 --> 00:21:48.051
It's five minutes
out of the box.

00:21:48.051 --> 00:21:49.780
They've got lots
of stuff built in.

00:21:49.780 --> 00:21:51.610
And their firmware
keeps getting better

00:21:51.610 --> 00:21:53.015
in terms of being able to do it.

00:21:53.015 --> 00:21:54.140
It's got follow technology.

00:21:54.140 --> 00:21:57.510
Now you can actually lock in
wave points and you can focus.

00:21:57.510 --> 00:21:59.530
They have a new
camera system, too.

00:21:59.530 --> 00:22:03.310
But for a filmmaker that's
always been pedestrian

00:22:03.310 --> 00:22:07.270
and on the ground, and wanting
to get into lots of places--

00:22:07.270 --> 00:22:10.000
especially since we've started
the "American Strays" project,

00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:10.830
we're chasing dogs.

00:22:10.830 --> 00:22:12.920
We're trying to get into areas
that we just can't get into.

00:22:12.920 --> 00:22:14.180
You want something like this.

00:22:14.180 --> 00:22:16.800
But prior to this,
this past year,

00:22:16.800 --> 00:22:21.755
the technology was too hard to
do in a run-and-done fashion

00:22:21.755 --> 00:22:23.970
like we do it here.

00:22:23.970 --> 00:22:25.010
I throw open the truck.

00:22:25.010 --> 00:22:26.070
I pull it out.

00:22:26.070 --> 00:22:27.970
If I had it already
pre-configured,

00:22:27.970 --> 00:22:31.850
all I do is set my compass, kind
of like I do this little dance.

00:22:31.850 --> 00:22:32.441
And I watch.

00:22:32.441 --> 00:22:32.940
I get a GPS.

00:22:32.940 --> 00:22:34.080
MARC DE SCHWEINITZ:
So I guess it's really

00:22:34.080 --> 00:22:35.360
a game changer for you?

00:22:35.360 --> 00:22:36.277
TOM MCPHEE: It's huge.

00:22:36.277 --> 00:22:38.110
And it pokes into a lot
of different places.

00:22:38.110 --> 00:22:40.970
We've been able to chase
and find dogs this way

00:22:40.970 --> 00:22:43.330
as part of the work
that we're doing.

00:22:43.330 --> 00:22:46.390
But it also gives us really
dynamic picture-making

00:22:46.390 --> 00:22:47.360
capabilities, too.

00:22:49.950 --> 00:22:52.510
So, yeah, it's
totally game-changing.

00:22:52.510 --> 00:22:54.750
But the thing is, everybody
and their brother's

00:22:54.750 --> 00:22:56.630
going to have one.

00:22:56.630 --> 00:22:59.630
And they are already
starting to have them.

00:22:59.630 --> 00:23:01.727
And you're going to
see them everywhere.

00:23:01.727 --> 00:23:03.560
But then there's going
to be something else.

00:23:03.560 --> 00:23:07.580
And for us, that something
else right now, that is,

00:23:07.580 --> 00:23:11.890
we're doing this series with
teen girls that involves

00:23:11.890 --> 00:23:13.714
animal rescue and technology.

00:23:13.714 --> 00:23:18.440
And we want to use
the Ricoh Theta 360S.

00:23:18.440 --> 00:23:20.200
And we want to attach
it to the girls.

00:23:20.200 --> 00:23:20.760
It's a 360.

00:23:20.760 --> 00:23:25.780
It's your Google Earth-- your
Google Street camera-- brought

00:23:25.780 --> 00:23:30.430
down into miniature size that
you can attach to somebody.

00:23:30.430 --> 00:23:32.730
360 is the thing, right now.

00:23:32.730 --> 00:23:35.760
And YouTube allows
us to share 360 video

00:23:35.760 --> 00:23:37.140
and to interact with stuff.

00:23:37.140 --> 00:23:38.340
MARC DE SCHWEINITZ: So
they wear it on a helmet?

00:23:38.340 --> 00:23:39.090
Or how does this work?

00:23:39.090 --> 00:23:40.910
TOM MCPHEE: Yeah, we'll
probably figure out the best way

00:23:40.910 --> 00:23:41.760
to wear it.

00:23:41.760 --> 00:23:43.484
It might on a chestie.

00:23:43.484 --> 00:23:44.460
It might be a helmet.

00:23:44.460 --> 00:23:46.140
But we'll figure that out.

00:23:46.140 --> 00:23:48.230
My guess is it would
probably be up front.

00:23:48.230 --> 00:23:50.250
That way the person
is in the action.

00:23:50.250 --> 00:23:52.300
But then the person
looking at them is here.

00:23:52.300 --> 00:23:57.310
So we'll film conventionally
certain parts of the series.

00:23:57.310 --> 00:24:00.010
But then you can
go online and have

00:24:00.010 --> 00:24:02.026
this more immersive experience.

00:24:02.026 --> 00:24:05.665
Especially if you're a girl
to-- you work with this material

00:24:05.665 --> 00:24:08.530
that these other girls
are doing by being

00:24:08.530 --> 00:24:10.660
able to explore in the video.

00:24:10.660 --> 00:24:12.420
It's accessible right now.

00:24:12.420 --> 00:24:14.550
As a matter of fact,
we're looking for donors.

00:24:14.550 --> 00:24:17.270
We're trying to raise--
get four cameras.

00:24:17.270 --> 00:24:22.885
They're like $350 a piece
to get the 360 HD video.

00:24:22.885 --> 00:24:23.763
It's crazy.

00:24:23.763 --> 00:24:26.822
Technology's very,
very available.

00:24:26.822 --> 00:24:28.280
MARC DE SCHWEINITZ:
So, Tom, you've

00:24:28.280 --> 00:24:31.866
mentioned the evolution
of more traditional media,

00:24:31.866 --> 00:24:35.360
television to
YouTube, the internet.

00:24:35.360 --> 00:24:38.880
How have you
changed your content

00:24:38.880 --> 00:24:40.410
or the way you do
your work because

00:24:40.410 --> 00:24:42.440
of YouTube and the internet?

00:24:42.440 --> 00:24:44.680
TOM MCPHEE: I'm a
[INAUDIBLE] genius.

00:24:44.680 --> 00:24:46.132
I love technology.

00:24:46.132 --> 00:24:47.340
I've always loved technology.

00:24:47.340 --> 00:24:50.014
I've had early everything.

00:24:50.014 --> 00:24:51.430
I had one of the
first CD players.

00:24:51.430 --> 00:24:55.300
I had early everything
that's been coming out

00:24:55.300 --> 00:24:57.735
since I was growing up.

00:24:57.735 --> 00:25:00.610
I was the very end
of the Baby Boomer.

00:25:00.610 --> 00:25:03.360
I'm a '64 baby.

00:25:03.360 --> 00:25:09.840
And we had phones with
cords in the kitchen.

00:25:09.840 --> 00:25:12.398
One of my first
professional jobs

00:25:12.398 --> 00:25:15.085
was selling-- I'm
killing my mic,

00:25:15.085 --> 00:25:18.780
I'm sure-- one of my first jobs
was selling cellular phones

00:25:18.780 --> 00:25:19.580
very early on.

00:25:19.580 --> 00:25:22.670
I was selling those brick
phones for $3,000 a pop.

00:25:22.670 --> 00:25:24.060
I love technology.

00:25:24.060 --> 00:25:29.320
And right now, there's so many
different ways to apply it.

00:25:29.320 --> 00:25:32.470
So to me, it's not
even about keeping up.

00:25:32.470 --> 00:25:35.105
It's about being in this
joyous place because I

00:25:35.105 --> 00:25:38.770
can find more things to do what
we're doing better, cheaper,

00:25:38.770 --> 00:25:39.650
faster.

00:25:39.650 --> 00:25:41.726
I want to be the
Vice in this realm.

00:25:41.726 --> 00:25:43.350
As a matter of fact,
we've been talking

00:25:43.350 --> 00:25:45.791
with Shane Smith and Vice.

00:25:45.791 --> 00:25:47.791
We've been talking with
a few other broadcasters

00:25:47.791 --> 00:25:51.560
about ramping up our
content and production.

00:25:51.560 --> 00:25:54.714
We want to be broadcasting
24/7 around the world.

00:25:54.714 --> 00:25:57.130
MARC DE SCHWEINITZ: And there's
so much content on YouTube

00:25:57.130 --> 00:25:57.860
right now.

00:25:57.860 --> 00:25:59.943
How do you cut through
that clutter and stand out?

00:25:59.943 --> 00:26:02.780
I've seen some of your videos
have hundreds of thousands

00:26:02.780 --> 00:26:04.990
of views, and
organically, I believe?

00:26:04.990 --> 00:26:07.540
TOM MCPHEE: Yeah, well,
it's building relationships.

00:26:07.540 --> 00:26:11.890
So part of that is that
we put out some content.

00:26:11.890 --> 00:26:13.790
Someone would think
well enough of it

00:26:13.790 --> 00:26:15.180
that they start to carry it.

00:26:15.180 --> 00:26:18.790
And using analytics--
YouTube's some great analytics.

00:26:18.790 --> 00:26:20.380
Google has great analytics.

00:26:20.380 --> 00:26:22.650
We can actually
really understand

00:26:22.650 --> 00:26:27.449
who's using those
videos, who likes them.

00:26:27.449 --> 00:26:28.990
And then we can go
and cater to them.

00:26:28.990 --> 00:26:34.550
In our situation, we
communicate out to about 185

00:26:34.550 --> 00:26:39.580
different-- from the dark side
of things-- digital publishers

00:26:39.580 --> 00:26:41.890
that over time have
carried our content.

00:26:41.890 --> 00:26:43.360
And some of them do really well.

00:26:43.360 --> 00:26:46.100
Some of them are pretty
big digital publishers.

00:26:46.100 --> 00:26:48.860
Little Things, which ranks
really high right now

00:26:48.860 --> 00:26:50.224
in terms of the mobile world.

00:26:50.224 --> 00:26:56.040
The Animal Rescue Site is a
monster in terms of depth.

00:26:56.040 --> 00:26:58.470
It's part of the Greater
Good Organization, just

00:26:58.470 --> 00:27:01.224
on their Animal Rescue Site
Facebook page, like 6 million,

00:27:01.224 --> 00:27:04.330
but very active viewers.

00:27:04.330 --> 00:27:07.062
Rough Life, I think,
is one of the videos

00:27:07.062 --> 00:27:08.562
we were just recently
talking about,

00:27:08.562 --> 00:27:11.630
just passed a half-million
views in the last six weeks.

00:27:11.630 --> 00:27:14.090
And it did exceedingly well.

00:27:14.090 --> 00:27:19.250
They did 150,000 shares in
three days off of that one.

00:27:19.250 --> 00:27:20.890
But then, that's
what happens, too.

00:27:20.890 --> 00:27:25.220
In a viral sense,
we are absolutely

00:27:25.220 --> 00:27:28.690
selling some of our content
through these channels now.

00:27:28.690 --> 00:27:31.290
And how you set them
up, how you build

00:27:31.290 --> 00:27:34.252
them, the cards that you use,
the metatags that you use,

00:27:34.252 --> 00:27:35.740
the title.

00:27:35.740 --> 00:27:37.250
People will notice
that our titles,

00:27:37.250 --> 00:27:40.700
that they're longer titles, but
they're all very descriptive.

00:27:40.700 --> 00:27:43.330
"Puppy in pipe terrified."

00:27:43.330 --> 00:27:45.860
So it's all these
very descriptive words

00:27:45.860 --> 00:27:48.510
that help generate and make
those other connections.

00:27:48.510 --> 00:27:51.560
And once we get to a certain
point with each of our videos

00:27:51.560 --> 00:27:53.880
that goes out to a
pipeline, gets to a point,

00:27:53.880 --> 00:27:59.612
then it starts to do a
regular wavelength of content.

00:27:59.612 --> 00:28:01.570
And I don't know if it's
how people are finding

00:28:01.570 --> 00:28:03.120
it, the tags, and so on.

00:28:03.120 --> 00:28:07.670
So our video's then start to
be these little engines that

00:28:07.670 --> 00:28:08.467
start to continue.

00:28:08.467 --> 00:28:10.050
But you got to get
to a certain point.

00:28:10.050 --> 00:28:13.530
And I don't know
what that is just yet

00:28:13.530 --> 00:28:14.912
when they start to just roll.

00:28:14.912 --> 00:28:17.370
MARC DE SCHWEINITZ: How do you
know when you're succeeding?

00:28:17.370 --> 00:28:20.880
You have your subscriber
base is going up, more views.

00:28:20.880 --> 00:28:23.990
And what's ultimately your
goal, then, with awareness?

00:28:26.880 --> 00:28:30.150
TOM MCPHEE: Our goal, really,
is to try to make it very easy,

00:28:30.150 --> 00:28:33.620
like ESPN, to look
into this realm

00:28:33.620 --> 00:28:36.090
and sort through what's
real and what's not.

00:28:36.090 --> 00:28:40.230
I mean, they're first
entity that I look in.

00:28:40.230 --> 00:28:42.250
They're omnipresent,
they deal with sports.

00:28:42.250 --> 00:28:46.210
I think this is as big of
a market segment that's

00:28:46.210 --> 00:28:50.620
heavily underserved because it
hasn't been served properly.

00:28:50.620 --> 00:28:53.776
The producers in the past, or
the broadcasters in the past,

00:28:53.776 --> 00:28:56.695
they become somewhat
users of the content

00:28:56.695 --> 00:28:58.905
and then users of
the environment.

00:28:58.905 --> 00:29:00.060
We don't want to do that.

00:29:00.060 --> 00:29:03.220
We actually have
a no-touching-- we

00:29:03.220 --> 00:29:06.610
are banned from interacting
with animals whatsoever.

00:29:06.610 --> 00:29:10.200
Our objective is to
communicate all of the stories

00:29:10.200 --> 00:29:14.000
out there of all the nonprofits
that are doing righteous work.

00:29:14.000 --> 00:29:17.726
And there's literally
tens of thousands of them.

00:29:17.726 --> 00:29:19.790
And for us, when
we start to look

00:29:19.790 --> 00:29:22.166
at what they do, the
interactions that they

00:29:22.166 --> 00:29:24.210
have, and we start to
build stories around them,

00:29:24.210 --> 00:29:26.760
then we start to create
that impact for them.

00:29:26.760 --> 00:29:29.760
For the people that are
watching the content,

00:29:29.760 --> 00:29:33.940
for us to build a base of
broadcasters and production

00:29:33.940 --> 00:29:36.890
departments that come to us
because we monetize what we're

00:29:36.890 --> 00:29:38.182
doing a lot of different ways.

00:29:38.182 --> 00:29:39.140
You talk about success.

00:29:39.140 --> 00:29:40.940
What's successful?

00:29:40.940 --> 00:29:44.420
For us, our numbers of
views are exceedingly

00:29:44.420 --> 00:29:46.020
high for our subscribers.

00:29:46.020 --> 00:29:49.660
We're going to hit about 13,000
subscribers here shortly.

00:29:49.660 --> 00:29:53.150
We're working with a
consulting company right now.

00:29:53.150 --> 00:29:57.740
And our goal is by this
time September of next year

00:29:57.740 --> 00:29:59.492
to be 100,000 subscribers.

00:29:59.492 --> 00:30:03.000
So we've got 87,000
to go in 10 months.

00:30:03.000 --> 00:30:04.760
So that's one way to measure it.

00:30:04.760 --> 00:30:07.070
But for us, it's also donations.

00:30:07.070 --> 00:30:09.770
Are we generating
the donations that we

00:30:09.770 --> 00:30:11.910
should through these programs?

00:30:11.910 --> 00:30:14.750
Everything that we do is
generated from outside income,

00:30:14.750 --> 00:30:18.560
whether we license
content, whether we

00:30:18.560 --> 00:30:21.070
do work for hire-- so
someone might go, hey,

00:30:21.070 --> 00:30:22.760
we need this kind of
stuff-- everything

00:30:22.760 --> 00:30:26.330
then goes back into World Animal
Awareness Society and WA2S

00:30:26.330 --> 00:30:28.565
Films so we can
actually tell stories

00:30:28.565 --> 00:30:31.410
about all these other
organizations that

00:30:31.410 --> 00:30:34.240
have no communications entity.

00:30:34.240 --> 00:30:36.400
They rely on someone like us.

00:30:36.400 --> 00:30:39.640
We want to be Vice, ESPN,
and National Geographic.

00:30:39.640 --> 00:30:42.690
Five years from now, when
we have this conversation,

00:30:42.690 --> 00:30:44.900
I expect it to be in one
of the YouTube auditoriums

00:30:44.900 --> 00:30:47.010
on one of the coasts.

00:30:47.010 --> 00:30:49.340
And we're greeting
so many people

00:30:49.340 --> 00:30:51.800
because we've been then
broadcasting for a year

00:30:51.800 --> 00:30:52.820
already 24/7.

00:30:52.820 --> 00:30:55.928
And we've got our mass
audience that we can tap into.

00:30:55.928 --> 00:30:57.374
So you might find [INAUDIBLE].

00:30:57.374 --> 00:30:58.707
MARC DE SCHWEINITZ: Yeah, great.

00:30:58.707 --> 00:30:59.912
That's exciting.

00:30:59.912 --> 00:31:01.786
Let's talk about your
lifestyle a little bit.

00:31:01.786 --> 00:31:04.864
As capturing all this film,
I imagine you're on the road

00:31:04.864 --> 00:31:05.814
quite a bit.

00:31:05.814 --> 00:31:06.480
TOM MCPHEE: Yes.

00:31:06.480 --> 00:31:08.063
MARC DE SCHWEINITZ:
What is that like?

00:31:08.063 --> 00:31:09.745
For people that are
used to a 9-5 job--

00:31:09.745 --> 00:31:10.370
TOM MCPHEE: No.

00:31:10.370 --> 00:31:12.369
MARC DE SCHWEINITZ: --how's
that differ for you?

00:31:12.369 --> 00:31:13.510
TOM MCPHEE: Yes.

00:31:13.510 --> 00:31:14.144
Yes, it does.

00:31:14.144 --> 00:31:15.185
MARC DE SCHWEINITZ: Yeah.

00:31:15.185 --> 00:31:17.310
Tell us what your typical
week might look like.

00:31:17.310 --> 00:31:19.435
TOM MCPHEE: Seriously,
look, there's no such thing.

00:31:19.435 --> 00:31:23.246
I burn through houses and
wives and girlfriends.

00:31:23.246 --> 00:31:28.090
And I am very happy to say
I am in a really happy point

00:31:28.090 --> 00:31:32.170
in my life because
the love of my life

00:31:32.170 --> 00:31:35.030
happens to be also
a partner in crime

00:31:35.030 --> 00:31:37.887
and loves being on the
front lines here capturing

00:31:37.887 --> 00:31:39.350
this stuff.

00:31:39.350 --> 00:31:43.710
Yesterday, Sunday mornings are
normally like go to the movies

00:31:43.710 --> 00:31:46.090
because you got a rave.

00:31:46.090 --> 00:31:48.618
On first movie of the
day, it's like $5,

00:31:48.618 --> 00:31:50.714
real cheap for a
first-run movie.

00:31:50.714 --> 00:31:52.900
And think we wanted to
see "Bridge of Spies"

00:31:52.900 --> 00:31:57.676
and break down some of the film,
look at it, watch the movie

00:31:57.676 --> 00:32:00.150
and enjoy it, but also
look at it as filmmakers.

00:32:00.150 --> 00:32:02.250
And instead, because
it was so nice,

00:32:02.250 --> 00:32:07.525
we decided to go and film this
rescue of 13 dogs, six puppies,

00:32:07.525 --> 00:32:10.970
which is now at wa2s.org,
because we wanted

00:32:10.970 --> 00:32:13.240
to actually practice
our filmmaking skills

00:32:13.240 --> 00:32:16.490
and work with this new camera.

00:32:16.490 --> 00:32:20.932
There is no-- I have, from
what I understand, we all die.

00:32:20.932 --> 00:32:25.032
I have a limited number of
days between now and then.

00:32:25.032 --> 00:32:26.490
And I go, that's
what I want to do.

00:32:26.490 --> 00:32:28.890
And there's a lot of things
that I need to learn, especially

00:32:28.890 --> 00:32:30.766
as we roll into some
of this new technology,

00:32:30.766 --> 00:32:33.260
and we're using some
online platforms,

00:32:33.260 --> 00:32:35.220
and we're smushing
it all together.

00:32:35.220 --> 00:32:41.450
So don't expect golf
trips, bass fishing.

00:32:41.450 --> 00:32:43.250
I used to do all that stuff.

00:32:43.250 --> 00:32:43.910
I used to ski.

00:32:43.910 --> 00:32:45.420
I used to go fishing
all the time.

00:32:45.420 --> 00:32:47.730
I used to play 30,
40 rounds of golf.

00:32:47.730 --> 00:32:49.970
I used to travel.

00:32:49.970 --> 00:32:53.546
My travel is into a danger zone
to film these interactions.

00:32:53.546 --> 00:32:56.430
And I couldn't imagine
doing anything else.

00:32:56.430 --> 00:32:58.065
I live for this stuff.

00:32:58.065 --> 00:32:59.440
MARC DE SCHWEINITZ:
That's great.

00:32:59.440 --> 00:33:01.390
You have definitely a
lot passion about this.

00:33:01.390 --> 00:33:01.890
I can tell.

00:33:01.890 --> 00:33:03.348
I have seen you in
some what looked

00:33:03.348 --> 00:33:06.370
like dangerous neighborhoods
in some of your videos.

00:33:06.370 --> 00:33:07.330
Are you ever scared?

00:33:07.330 --> 00:33:08.170
Do you feel like
you're in danger ever?

00:33:08.170 --> 00:33:09.419
TOM MCPHEE: Not in the moment.

00:33:09.419 --> 00:33:12.850
And a lot of times, a lot of
disturbing situations, too.

00:33:12.850 --> 00:33:15.560
And I filter every
through a lens.

00:33:15.560 --> 00:33:17.844
The idea for me
is I need to focus

00:33:17.844 --> 00:33:20.510
on what I'm doing because I want
you to be able to look at this.

00:33:20.510 --> 00:33:22.880
Now, afterwards, like
"American Opera,"

00:33:22.880 --> 00:33:25.710
so we captured hundreds
of hours of stuff.

00:33:25.710 --> 00:33:31.290
We're seeing footage of police
officers shooting dogs, just

00:33:31.290 --> 00:33:33.320
really horrific stuff.

00:33:33.320 --> 00:33:37.250
And then I've got to go edit
this for a couple years.

00:33:37.250 --> 00:33:41.860
The first six months of editing
that, everything caught up

00:33:41.860 --> 00:33:42.360
to me.

00:33:42.360 --> 00:33:44.395
So you're out there,
just doing whatever.

00:33:44.395 --> 00:33:47.440
It's like all-- and then
you get into the edit suite,

00:33:47.440 --> 00:33:48.171
and you get in.

00:33:48.171 --> 00:33:49.045
And then things stop.

00:33:49.045 --> 00:33:51.165
And then you start
to see everything

00:33:51.165 --> 00:33:52.890
and you're building this thing.

00:33:52.890 --> 00:33:57.180
And then everything that you're
running from and filtering

00:33:57.180 --> 00:33:58.880
through catches up.

00:33:58.880 --> 00:34:01.110
And I was knocked out.

00:34:01.110 --> 00:34:03.710
I cried every day for
probably 45 minutes every day.

00:34:03.710 --> 00:34:06.720
When it first started happening,
I was really freaked out.

00:34:06.720 --> 00:34:07.970
And then I just let it happen.

00:34:07.970 --> 00:34:09.560
Everyday, it was
like, OK, we do that.

00:34:09.560 --> 00:34:12.419
And it actually led
to the creative stuff

00:34:12.419 --> 00:34:15.365
that came out of it. "An
American Opera" totally

00:34:15.365 --> 00:34:20.065
would not have happened if I did
not have this total meltdown.

00:34:20.065 --> 00:34:24.633
But I figured out how to
kind of deal with that stuff

00:34:24.633 --> 00:34:26.010
and to sort through.

00:34:26.010 --> 00:34:29.605
But there is-- you
can't [INAUDIBLE].

00:34:29.605 --> 00:34:31.170
We're putting out
a lot of content.

00:34:31.170 --> 00:34:32.513
We've got very impressive goals.

00:34:32.513 --> 00:34:34.179
We have a lot of
people that are getting

00:34:34.179 --> 00:34:35.636
behind what we're doing.

00:34:35.636 --> 00:34:42.095
We're interacting with HBO and
[INAUDIBLE] Productions and Nat

00:34:42.095 --> 00:34:43.659
Geographic and all these others.

00:34:43.659 --> 00:34:47.100
And there is no--
this is what we do.

00:34:47.100 --> 00:34:48.315
MARC DE SCHWEINITZ: Right.

00:34:48.315 --> 00:34:50.239
That makes sense.

00:34:50.239 --> 00:34:56.070
So what would you be
doing if WA2S graduated?

00:34:56.070 --> 00:34:58.800
Do you have any other projects
that you want to work on?

00:34:58.800 --> 00:35:01.240
Or do you plan to stay
with this organization

00:35:01.240 --> 00:35:02.510
for the next [INAUDIBLE]?

00:35:02.510 --> 00:35:04.426
TOM MCPHEE: Well, yeah,
see, that's the thing.

00:35:04.426 --> 00:35:06.410
The whole ideas was to
take this and to build

00:35:06.410 --> 00:35:09.010
this foundational
thing so we can then

00:35:09.010 --> 00:35:10.950
jump into anything, anywhere.

00:35:10.950 --> 00:35:12.630
MARC DE SCHWEINITZ: [INAUDIBLE].

00:35:12.630 --> 00:35:14.850
TOM MCPHEE: Yeah, we're
pitching an incredible show

00:35:14.850 --> 00:35:18.460
with this guy called Steve
[? Henny ?] on Shark Online.

00:35:18.460 --> 00:35:22.420
This guy has been incredible,
taking on very powerful people.

00:35:22.420 --> 00:35:25.090
Right now, he's taking on
United States Senator Jim

00:35:25.090 --> 00:35:27.160
Inhofe of Oklahoma.

00:35:27.160 --> 00:35:30.840
On 9/11 this year he ran the
tenth of his canned pigeon

00:35:30.840 --> 00:35:32.590
shoots where they bring
a thousand pigeons

00:35:32.590 --> 00:35:34.850
and they throw them up and
they just shoot them all.

00:35:34.850 --> 00:35:37.410
And they pitch them into
a pit and burn them all.

00:35:37.410 --> 00:35:40.360
And so these guys have been
after them for a couple years.

00:35:40.360 --> 00:35:43.720
And this year, they were flying
a drone to capture whatever.

00:35:43.720 --> 00:35:48.990
And someone from the Inhofe
collective shot down the drone.

00:35:48.990 --> 00:35:51.650
And then a bunch of other
federal legal things.

00:35:51.650 --> 00:35:56.774
We're trying to get Steve on
as a contributor to the John

00:35:56.774 --> 00:35:59.311
Oliver show on Sunday nights.

00:35:59.311 --> 00:36:01.106
He's extremely serious.

00:36:01.106 --> 00:36:02.490
He's a ball-buster.

00:36:02.490 --> 00:36:04.739
And we think he'd be an
all-too-great foil because it

00:36:04.739 --> 00:36:07.280
would be fun almost to have John
Oliver play with this things

00:36:07.280 --> 00:36:13.505
how he does and still
push [INAUDIBLE] agenda.

00:36:13.505 --> 00:36:16.895
There's so much going
on at this realm, Mark.

00:36:19.850 --> 00:36:23.840
So right now, we've done a
number of different things

00:36:23.840 --> 00:36:25.440
over the last couple years.

00:36:25.440 --> 00:36:28.120
We have a focus on
emergency disasters--

00:36:28.120 --> 00:36:33.060
[INAUDIBLE] which I
want to really ramp up.

00:36:33.060 --> 00:36:36.590
And we've bee focusing on what
I been call the American Strays

00:36:36.590 --> 00:36:38.786
Umbrella Program,
Operation Houston good

00:36:38.786 --> 00:36:42.510
pet guardian lesson plans,
American Strays canine survey,

00:36:42.510 --> 00:36:45.915
bringing in science to really
then build stories around,

00:36:45.915 --> 00:36:47.910
but we're still
putting out science.

00:36:47.910 --> 00:36:50.320
We're actually
serving these places

00:36:50.320 --> 00:36:54.580
and providing real data to
help them make some decisions.

00:36:54.580 --> 00:36:57.620
So this has been a big
initiative for four years.

00:36:57.620 --> 00:36:59.740
The next one that
we've been kind

00:36:59.740 --> 00:37:02.390
of messing with a little
bit-- and it goes to our Steve

00:37:02.390 --> 00:37:05.700
[? Henny ?] the
shark relationship--

00:37:05.700 --> 00:37:08.590
is the use of animal in sport.

00:37:08.590 --> 00:37:12.540
So if I was to say
another big umbrella,

00:37:12.540 --> 00:37:15.511
it would be everything
that you can imagine

00:37:15.511 --> 00:37:23.230
of where man fits with animal in
any kind of sporting situation,

00:37:23.230 --> 00:37:26.430
whether it's bull
fighting, or derby fishing,

00:37:26.430 --> 00:37:30.460
or rattle snake round-ups,
or snapper fests,

00:37:30.460 --> 00:37:31.610
or pig wrestling.

00:37:31.610 --> 00:37:33.860
A lot of these things we've
already done some filming.

00:37:33.860 --> 00:37:39.190
I'm fascinated of how we have
these physical interactions

00:37:39.190 --> 00:37:40.460
with it.

00:37:40.460 --> 00:37:43.260
And then probably once
we've got a handle on that,

00:37:43.260 --> 00:37:47.051
too-- only because it's
such a massive environment

00:37:47.051 --> 00:37:49.550
and I'd probably need to bring
in some outside specialists--

00:37:49.550 --> 00:37:52.080
is the whole idea of food.

00:37:52.080 --> 00:37:57.142
The whole vegan-- I have no
concept of vegan and vegetarian

00:37:57.142 --> 00:37:58.300
and that.

00:37:58.300 --> 00:38:00.800
And I keep reaching out
to the vegan community,

00:38:00.800 --> 00:38:04.000
and they all just
say, it's [MUMBLING].

00:38:04.000 --> 00:38:08.720
I'd love to have some
help really breaking down

00:38:08.720 --> 00:38:11.580
the intrigue and the mystique.

00:38:11.580 --> 00:38:13.210
But to me, that's
such a big thing

00:38:13.210 --> 00:38:15.762
to chase after, I want to get
these other big things out

00:38:15.762 --> 00:38:17.270
of the way first before
we get after that.

00:38:17.270 --> 00:38:17.420
MARC DE SCHWEINITZ: Makes sense.

00:38:17.420 --> 00:38:18.870
Yeah, that's a big topic.

00:38:18.870 --> 00:38:19.930
TOM MCPHEE: It's huge.

00:38:19.930 --> 00:38:23.712
And you're talking about the
food for most of the world.

00:38:23.712 --> 00:38:26.800
And it's a big thing.

00:38:26.800 --> 00:38:31.480
I need years to still think
about how do we really

00:38:31.480 --> 00:38:33.464
get at it and do it justice.

00:38:33.464 --> 00:38:35.130
MARC DE SCHWEINITZ:
Last topic before we

00:38:35.130 --> 00:38:38.720
have Q&amp;A if anyone in the
audience has a question.

00:38:38.720 --> 00:38:41.000
Let's talk about the
Michigan economy.

00:38:41.000 --> 00:38:44.360
You're Ann Arbor-based,
Detroit-based.

00:38:44.360 --> 00:38:47.770
How important is it for you to
be in Michigan and capturing

00:38:47.770 --> 00:38:48.760
stories in the area?

00:38:48.760 --> 00:38:50.479
TOM MCPHEE: I am from Michigan.

00:38:50.479 --> 00:38:56.270
My family helped settle the town
of Dearborn where I grew up.

00:38:56.270 --> 00:38:58.360
And I have lot of
[? heritage ?] now.

00:38:58.360 --> 00:39:03.100
Most of us have now all
moved away from Dearborn.

00:39:03.100 --> 00:39:05.275
There's something
about Michigan.

00:39:05.275 --> 00:39:09.769
I've had opportunities to move,
to be in different places.

00:39:09.769 --> 00:39:12.920
And we have a presence
on both coasts.

00:39:12.920 --> 00:39:15.090
We have editing and sales
in New York, and then

00:39:15.090 --> 00:39:16.496
sales in LA as well.

00:39:21.684 --> 00:39:23.210
I'm almost done
with the winters,

00:39:23.210 --> 00:39:26.390
so I can see the migration.

00:39:26.390 --> 00:39:29.029
Maybe Arizona.

00:39:29.029 --> 00:39:29.570
I don't know.

00:39:29.570 --> 00:39:29.995
We'll see.

00:39:29.995 --> 00:39:30.620
MARC DE SCHWEINITZ:
Better weather.

00:39:30.620 --> 00:39:31.620
TOM MCPHEE: Yeah, right.

00:39:31.620 --> 00:39:32.230
For sure.

00:39:32.230 --> 00:39:36.460
But I've been kind
of keen to the state.

00:39:36.460 --> 00:39:38.676
I've been asked in the
past, for instance,

00:39:38.676 --> 00:39:40.070
about incentives and this.

00:39:40.070 --> 00:39:41.102
I'm not an economist.

00:39:41.102 --> 00:39:42.560
I've watched things
go up and down.

00:39:42.560 --> 00:39:46.084
Our familiy is-- we were in
the automotive business, had

00:39:46.084 --> 00:39:47.510
automotive concerns.

00:39:47.510 --> 00:39:51.100
And the thing that I
don't understand-- I

00:39:51.100 --> 00:39:55.204
spent time interacting with the
Detroit economic environment

00:39:55.204 --> 00:39:57.920
in the '90s when I
had a film festival.

00:39:57.920 --> 00:40:02.020
And everything was still so
tied to auto this and auto that.

00:40:02.020 --> 00:40:04.750
And then my family,
now, we were tied to it.

00:40:04.750 --> 00:40:07.924
I just think that it's
been such a hard uncoupling

00:40:07.924 --> 00:40:11.750
of the environment as a
whole and diversifying

00:40:11.750 --> 00:40:18.190
to other things that when
we started to actually look

00:40:18.190 --> 00:40:20.710
at our efficiencies
and how we do business

00:40:20.710 --> 00:40:22.900
and moving a lot
of our labor away,

00:40:22.900 --> 00:40:26.730
it really fractured
just dramatically.

00:40:26.730 --> 00:40:28.820
And hopefully,
though, for instance,

00:40:28.820 --> 00:40:31.295
with Detroit, a lot of
the artistic endeavors

00:40:31.295 --> 00:40:35.350
that are taking place, a lot
of the push for this culture--

00:40:35.350 --> 00:40:37.510
culture is hard to do.

00:40:37.510 --> 00:40:40.180
It's usually expensive, money,
whether it's art this and that.

00:40:40.180 --> 00:40:43.390
But when you have a really
depressed environment like that

00:40:43.390 --> 00:40:45.397
that needs some help,
it's like the first thing

00:40:45.397 --> 00:40:47.455
and the greatest
thing that can help.

00:40:47.455 --> 00:40:49.450
But it's like they
need each other.

00:40:49.450 --> 00:40:52.385
The city needs that
kind of vibrant stuff.

00:40:52.385 --> 00:40:56.375
And vibrant people need a place
that's inexpensive to go to.

00:40:56.375 --> 00:40:59.670
I just hope Detroit doesn't
get too expensive too quick

00:40:59.670 --> 00:41:03.122
before it can really heal
itself because it needs

00:41:03.122 --> 00:41:06.260
to have a great deal--
we spend a lot of time

00:41:06.260 --> 00:41:07.780
in a lot of cities.

00:41:07.780 --> 00:41:10.156
Houston, sure, you
talk about things.

00:41:10.156 --> 00:41:11.210
We don't think about it.

00:41:11.210 --> 00:41:11.710
We don't.

00:41:11.710 --> 00:41:12.790
We just kind of do it.

00:41:12.790 --> 00:41:13.380
We interact.

00:41:13.380 --> 00:41:15.720
We try to be true
about what's going on.

00:41:15.720 --> 00:41:18.220
A couple of times
we've run really

00:41:18.220 --> 00:41:20.280
quickly out of situations.

00:41:20.280 --> 00:41:22.680
But Detroit's huge.

00:41:22.680 --> 00:41:24.202
It's a big place.

00:41:24.202 --> 00:41:26.410
And there's a lot of people
that are missing from it.

00:41:26.410 --> 00:41:29.340
And it's got a lot
of healing to do.

00:41:29.340 --> 00:41:31.915
The surrounding area
is very popular.

00:41:31.915 --> 00:41:33.790
Oakland County for the
longest period of time

00:41:33.790 --> 00:41:38.425
was the third wealthiest
county in the country.

00:41:38.425 --> 00:41:39.800
MARC DE SCHWEINITZ:
We appreciate

00:41:39.800 --> 00:41:43.260
you being in the area and
industry like yourself.

00:41:43.260 --> 00:41:45.300
TOM MCPHEE: If I'm
going to be here,

00:41:45.300 --> 00:41:47.920
Ann Arbor is totally
the place to be.

00:41:47.920 --> 00:41:49.360
I love Ann Arbor.

00:41:49.360 --> 00:41:51.560
I love Grand Rapids.
[INAUDIBLE] Traverse City.

00:41:51.560 --> 00:41:52.979
But here, I love Ann Arbor.

00:41:52.979 --> 00:41:54.398
The vibe is just great.

00:41:54.398 --> 00:41:55.820
MARC DE SCHWEINITZ: Great.

00:41:55.820 --> 00:41:57.320
Do we have any
questions from anyone

00:41:57.320 --> 00:42:00.750
in the audience about making
documentary films or anything

00:42:00.750 --> 00:42:03.944
else you want to ask about?

00:42:03.944 --> 00:42:05.152
TOM MCPHEE: What's your name?

00:42:05.152 --> 00:42:06.349
AUDIENCE: Hi, I'm Kelsey.

00:42:06.349 --> 00:42:07.140
TOM MCPHEE: Kelsey?

00:42:07.140 --> 00:42:08.530
AUDIENCE: Oh, I don't
need a microphone.

00:42:08.530 --> 00:42:09.040
TOM MCPHEE: Yeah, you do.

00:42:09.040 --> 00:42:10.416
AUDIENCE: I'm just loud.

00:42:10.416 --> 00:42:12.110
TOM MCPHEE: Kelsey, there's
a whole bunch of other people

00:42:12.110 --> 00:42:14.540
all over the world that are
actually paying attention

00:42:14.540 --> 00:42:15.470
to what we're doing.

00:42:15.470 --> 00:42:16.258
AUDIENCE: Hello?

00:42:16.258 --> 00:42:17.924
TOM MCPHEE: What's
your full name again?

00:42:17.924 --> 00:42:19.780
AUDIENCE: My name
is Kelsey Snyder.

00:42:19.780 --> 00:42:20.244
TOM MCPHEE: That's cool.

00:42:20.244 --> 00:42:20.970
AUDIENCE: Thanks for coming.

00:42:20.970 --> 00:42:22.170
This is super interesting.

00:42:22.170 --> 00:42:24.060
TOM MCPHEE: [INAUDIBLE]
we could get it done.

00:42:24.060 --> 00:42:25.730
AUDIENCE: So I was
just curious, You

00:42:25.730 --> 00:42:30.020
mentioned that you'd done work
for Animal Planet and Nat Geo.

00:42:30.020 --> 00:42:31.850
You worked with Bruce Campbell.

00:42:31.850 --> 00:42:34.099
I was wondering if you could
go into a little bit more

00:42:34.099 --> 00:42:38.000
about how something like a
show on Animal Planet works?

00:42:38.000 --> 00:42:41.490
Are a lot of the shows on
those types of channels

00:42:41.490 --> 00:42:43.150
from independent filmmakers?

00:42:43.150 --> 00:42:44.180
TOM MCPHEE: No.

00:42:44.180 --> 00:42:47.390
And it's not really to do
from an independent sense

00:42:47.390 --> 00:42:51.650
because a lot the big brands
definitely have a specific look

00:42:51.650 --> 00:42:52.240
and feel.

00:42:52.240 --> 00:42:58.482
For instance, right now,
Fox has a huge investment

00:42:58.482 --> 00:43:01.190
in Nat Geo and the National
Geographic properties.

00:43:01.190 --> 00:43:03.940
And that's all
shifting and changing.

00:43:03.940 --> 00:43:08.046
They definitely want some brand,
but it has its kind of look

00:43:08.046 --> 00:43:08.800
and feel.

00:43:08.800 --> 00:43:11.170
When you look across
the different brands,

00:43:11.170 --> 00:43:14.930
they all have their
distinct look and feel.

00:43:14.930 --> 00:43:18.080
I'm really good with the
fact that Animal Planet

00:43:18.080 --> 00:43:21.070
is what it is right now, Nat
Geo is what it is right now.

00:43:21.070 --> 00:43:23.860
Because for me, it's
a huge opportunity

00:43:23.860 --> 00:43:28.835
because it's a massive
market niche that

00:43:28.835 --> 00:43:31.460
is tremendously underserved.

00:43:31.460 --> 00:43:34.690
You're putting tree house
and mermaid shows and stuff

00:43:34.690 --> 00:43:36.510
like that on Animal Planet.

00:43:36.510 --> 00:43:40.370
Or, the river monster,
he's interesting.

00:43:40.370 --> 00:43:43.560
But it's just titillating.

00:43:43.560 --> 00:43:44.945
There's a certain aspect to it.

00:43:44.945 --> 00:43:46.486
And we're not really
getting anything

00:43:46.486 --> 00:43:48.936
of substance out of it.

00:43:48.936 --> 00:43:49.810
And that's the thing.

00:43:49.810 --> 00:43:52.620
How do you-- for
us, it's always,

00:43:52.620 --> 00:43:54.940
how do we get
something to go viral?

00:43:54.940 --> 00:43:57.450
So you do some
bait-clicky type things.

00:43:57.450 --> 00:44:03.770
But you also have something
that's really juicy behind it.

00:44:03.770 --> 00:44:08.700
It is very hard for
independents to get

00:44:08.700 --> 00:44:12.860
into that environment of
you need to generate partner

00:44:12.860 --> 00:44:15.840
with an existing entity.

00:44:15.840 --> 00:44:18.320
We're looking at a partnerships.

00:44:18.320 --> 00:44:22.560
We're looking to storm these
gates in a lot different ways.

00:44:22.560 --> 00:44:26.136
So we're looking for our own
content to stand on its own

00:44:26.136 --> 00:44:30.170
and to have a viral capability,
and to start to build a brand.

00:44:30.170 --> 00:44:32.590
It's really important for
us to have subscribers

00:44:32.590 --> 00:44:34.520
because these are
leverage points.

00:44:34.520 --> 00:44:38.060
We get carried in more
places if we ourselves

00:44:38.060 --> 00:44:40.530
have more YouTube subscribers.

00:44:40.530 --> 00:44:42.290
And so that gives
me the opportunity

00:44:42.290 --> 00:44:44.946
to also have leverage in
terms of setting meetings.

00:44:44.946 --> 00:44:47.607
Hey, we got a million people
that tune into us every time.

00:44:47.607 --> 00:44:49.440
And we're not just
showing funny cat videos,

00:44:49.440 --> 00:44:53.950
but we're actually a
meaningful piece behind this.

00:44:53.950 --> 00:44:56.200
So there's that.

00:44:56.200 --> 00:44:58.417
Then you're developing
relationships

00:44:58.417 --> 00:45:00.500
with potentially production
partner companies that

00:45:00.500 --> 00:45:03.090
are already putting out
content that are already being

00:45:03.090 --> 00:45:04.490
asked to look at other content.

00:45:04.490 --> 00:45:06.870
And this is where the show
with the girls with technology

00:45:06.870 --> 00:45:07.970
and so on comes in.

00:45:07.970 --> 00:45:12.230
So they're looking for someone
to take on and put together

00:45:12.230 --> 00:45:15.675
a sizzle for this concept
because they're already

00:45:15.675 --> 00:45:16.300
looking for it.

00:45:16.300 --> 00:45:19.580
So there's already a little
bit of a door opened up.

00:45:19.580 --> 00:45:25.540
And then it's depending on
some of the other things

00:45:25.540 --> 00:45:30.740
that you might do and
spin-offs may take place.

00:45:30.740 --> 00:45:34.010
"An American Opera" led to
two shows that I did in Canada

00:45:34.010 --> 00:45:37.472
in 2009, "Tom McPhee's
Rescue Journal"

00:45:37.472 --> 00:45:39.298
and "Rock-and-Roll Dogs."

00:45:39.298 --> 00:45:42.405
We were using dogs
and spoofing them.

00:45:42.405 --> 00:45:44.280
They were making people
sound like idiots.

00:45:44.280 --> 00:45:47.180
It was kind of fun.

00:45:47.180 --> 00:45:49.380
So it depends.

00:45:49.380 --> 00:45:54.927
But right now, I'm trying to
not be beholden to any entity

00:45:54.927 --> 00:45:59.033
where we have to look and
feel like them because I

00:45:59.033 --> 00:46:03.045
don't like a lot of the stuff
that we see on Animal Plant.

00:46:03.045 --> 00:46:04.550
It doesn't hold my attention.

00:46:04.550 --> 00:46:07.470
I want to know more
of what's going on.

00:46:07.470 --> 00:46:10.360
Look, HBO's changed the
game because they said,

00:46:10.360 --> 00:46:13.050
we're going to just go direct.

00:46:13.050 --> 00:46:14.720
We can host this stuff.

00:46:14.720 --> 00:46:17.520
We're going to run
our own pay gate.

00:46:17.520 --> 00:46:19.020
And you're just
going to come to us.

00:46:19.020 --> 00:46:19.650
And you're going to pay us.

00:46:19.650 --> 00:46:22.170
And you're going to run through
your own internet, wherever

00:46:22.170 --> 00:46:23.140
that may be.

00:46:23.140 --> 00:46:24.574
And you can watch our content.

00:46:24.574 --> 00:46:25.740
Well, they changed the game.

00:46:25.740 --> 00:46:27.677
That's what basically
YouTube's doing.

00:46:27.677 --> 00:46:28.760
And we're playing YouTube.

00:46:28.760 --> 00:46:30.884
And so we're doing the same
thing as HBO right now.

00:46:30.884 --> 00:46:36.754
Everybody that's connected to
the internet is my audience.

00:46:36.754 --> 00:46:38.795
That's one of the reasons
I wanted to put "world"

00:46:38.795 --> 00:46:40.110
in then name of it.

00:46:40.110 --> 00:46:41.370
Because I never stop.

00:46:41.370 --> 00:46:47.280
We pushed a lot into the
Philippines, Malaysia,

00:46:47.280 --> 00:46:49.357
Indonesia, China,
India because these

00:46:49.357 --> 00:46:51.590
are massive populations, too.

00:46:51.590 --> 00:46:57.420
So it all plays into it.

00:46:57.420 --> 00:46:59.680
So I see these
really power brokers.

00:46:59.680 --> 00:47:03.140
For me, it is a great time
to be a content producer.

00:47:03.140 --> 00:47:06.786
The last couple of years it's
been great being a curator.

00:47:06.786 --> 00:47:08.220
I know Scott DeLong.

00:47:08.220 --> 00:47:12.097
Scott DeLong just sold
ViralNova for $100 million

00:47:12.097 --> 00:47:13.930
after setting that up
for a couple of years.

00:47:13.930 --> 00:47:15.437
And that's a
bait-click, curatorial.

00:47:15.437 --> 00:47:16.020
You put stuff.

00:47:16.020 --> 00:47:18.560
And they carried a lot of
our stuff that went well.

00:47:18.560 --> 00:47:20.280
Little Things is just
the same kind way.

00:47:20.280 --> 00:47:21.600
Came out of PetFlow.

00:47:21.600 --> 00:47:24.340
The curatorial
side, though, is now

00:47:24.340 --> 00:47:27.770
creating this hunger
for more content.

00:47:27.770 --> 00:47:29.486
And they want videos.

00:47:29.486 --> 00:47:30.380
Video is king.

00:47:30.380 --> 00:47:32.939
We're looking at
partnerships similar to Vice.

00:47:32.939 --> 00:47:33.980
So Vice puts out content.

00:47:33.980 --> 00:47:35.605
They've got the people
that they serve.

00:47:35.605 --> 00:47:37.100
But because they
have a large base,

00:47:37.100 --> 00:47:39.240
they also have these
commercial partners

00:47:39.240 --> 00:47:41.215
that they are making
content for, and now

00:47:41.215 --> 00:47:43.446
these different [INAUDIBLE].

00:47:43.446 --> 00:47:44.260
So it's changing.

00:47:44.260 --> 00:47:47.500
And the one thing that's really
great about today and the tools

00:47:47.500 --> 00:47:52.940
and places like YouTube and
Google is it absolutely allows

00:47:52.940 --> 00:47:56.770
a small outfit like us to
have a bigger footprint

00:47:56.770 --> 00:47:59.680
and start to play and let
our content get out there.

00:47:59.680 --> 00:48:03.840
And bang, and then it's about
grabbing as many eyeballs as

00:48:03.840 --> 00:48:05.520
possible.

00:48:05.520 --> 00:48:07.230
And it's not about--
although we'd

00:48:07.230 --> 00:48:09.070
like to have the
broadcast relationships,

00:48:09.070 --> 00:48:11.330
if we do that, it's
going to be on our terms

00:48:11.330 --> 00:48:14.090
because we're going to build the
foundation enough that they're

00:48:14.090 --> 00:48:18.610
going to want to deal with
us, have our partnerships.

00:48:18.610 --> 00:48:20.710
We're going to getting
into some of the content

00:48:20.710 --> 00:48:21.688
that we get into.

00:48:21.688 --> 00:48:23.104
We're starting to
do things better

00:48:23.104 --> 00:48:25.770
than people in our realm, too.

00:48:25.770 --> 00:48:28.000
But it's a new day.

00:48:28.000 --> 00:48:32.247
And they're all shifting to go,
but I'm doing the same thing

00:48:32.247 --> 00:48:33.815
as HBO right now.

00:48:33.815 --> 00:48:35.440
MARC DE SCHWEINITZ:
So it almost sounds

00:48:35.440 --> 00:48:38.587
like the power has shifted quite
a bit from the big networks

00:48:38.587 --> 00:48:40.170
to the content
creators like yourself.

00:48:40.170 --> 00:48:41.094
TOM MCPHEE: Absolutely.

00:48:41.094 --> 00:48:42.719
MARC DE SCHWEINITZ:
Yeah, that's great.

00:48:42.719 --> 00:48:44.479
TOM MCPHEE: No, I love it.

00:48:44.479 --> 00:48:45.520
MARC DE SCHWEINITZ: Good.

00:48:45.520 --> 00:48:48.050
Well, Tom, I think we're going
to wrap it up at this point.

00:48:48.050 --> 00:48:50.710
I've learned a lot about
what you do in filmmaking.

00:48:50.710 --> 00:48:53.050
And I think all of us
appreciate the storytelling

00:48:53.050 --> 00:48:56.910
and the cause for the World
Animal Awareness Society.

00:48:56.910 --> 00:49:00.600
What is another way that
viewers can help your cause?

00:49:00.600 --> 00:49:02.240
To subscribe to your
YouTube channel?

00:49:02.240 --> 00:49:03.522
To download the--

00:49:03.522 --> 00:49:04.730
TOM MCPHEE: Yeah, absolutely.

00:49:04.730 --> 00:49:06.188
And all that stuff
comes from going

00:49:06.188 --> 00:49:08.795
to the front page, wa2s.org.

00:49:08.795 --> 00:49:13.390
And there is jumping points
to either Google+ or Facebook

00:49:13.390 --> 00:49:14.110
or YouTube.

00:49:14.110 --> 00:49:15.577
It would be great
to have everyone

00:49:15.577 --> 00:49:17.910
be a YouTube subscriber was
interested in their content.

00:49:17.910 --> 00:49:20.080
If there's a program that
you're interested in,

00:49:20.080 --> 00:49:22.130
there's plenty of
ways to donate.

00:49:22.130 --> 00:49:24.535
We have ways that people
can volunteer, too.

00:49:24.535 --> 00:49:26.270
There's a volunteer component.

00:49:26.270 --> 00:49:28.156
And there's lots
of stuff that can

00:49:28.156 --> 00:49:30.933
be done from anywhere in the
world to volunteer and to help

00:49:30.933 --> 00:49:31.630
with us.

00:49:31.630 --> 00:49:37.210
And I appreciate you, Mark, as
a volunteer doing what you do

00:49:37.210 --> 00:49:39.600
and helping us make
the connection.

00:49:39.600 --> 00:49:41.796
We've just recently
gone, as you know,

00:49:41.796 --> 00:49:44.122
from a Google Ad
Nonprofit partner

00:49:44.122 --> 00:49:46.510
to a Nonprofit Pro partner.

00:49:46.510 --> 00:49:49.322
And you helped us
set up someone here

00:49:49.322 --> 00:49:52.334
in Ann Arbor that's
helping us drive that,

00:49:52.334 --> 00:49:53.500
which is really mondo great.

00:49:53.500 --> 00:49:55.410
And so I appreciate that.

00:49:55.410 --> 00:49:59.510
Google has been
exceptional to us.

00:49:59.510 --> 00:50:01.235
YouTube partnership
has been-- I mean, I

00:50:01.235 --> 00:50:03.690
can't even describe it enough.

00:50:03.690 --> 00:50:08.290
The last thing I want to say to
you, I'm very excited for you,

00:50:08.290 --> 00:50:12.760
and this new project, this side
project that we have coming up,

00:50:12.760 --> 00:50:14.215
the horses and everything.

00:50:14.215 --> 00:50:15.590
You might be able
to get a chance

00:50:15.590 --> 00:50:17.328
to be on camera yourself more.

00:50:17.328 --> 00:50:18.744
MARC DE SCHWEINITZ:
That'd be fun.

00:50:18.744 --> 00:50:20.310
TOM MCPHEE: I'm
excited about it.

00:50:20.310 --> 00:50:21.351
MARC DE SCHWEINITZ: Sure.

00:50:21.351 --> 00:50:22.850
Thanks again for
joining us, Tom.

00:50:22.850 --> 00:50:24.370
And thanks for everyone.

00:50:24.370 --> 00:50:25.375
This is Talks at Google.

00:50:25.375 --> 00:50:27.716
I'm Mark de Schweinitz
and Tom McPhee.

00:50:27.716 --> 00:50:28.690
TOM MCPHEE: Thank you.

00:50:28.690 --> 00:50:30.065
MARC DE SCHWEINITZ:
[INAUDIBLE] ?

00:50:30.065 --> 00:50:30.840
[APPLAUSE]
