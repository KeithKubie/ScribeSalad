00:00:04.430 --> 00:00:04.930
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:04.930 --> 00:00:06.013
SOPHIE BOSTOCK: Thank you.

00:00:06.013 --> 00:00:06.902
Thank you so much.

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:12.990
It's always very
dangerous advertising

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:14.730
a talk for people who
are sleep deprived

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:16.188
because the odds
of them turning up

00:00:16.188 --> 00:00:18.313
a somewhat lower than
those more energized

00:00:18.313 --> 00:00:19.230
members of the public.

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:21.355
But thank you very, very
much for making the effort

00:00:21.355 --> 00:00:22.380
to turn up.

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:27.000
As Richard says, my job
title is a sleep evangelist.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.240
I'm very fond of that title
because if I do come and do

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:33.430
a talk, it really
takes the pressure off.

00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:36.300
Because if while I'm
talking you do sort of

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:41.260
feel your eyelids getting
heavy, now is the time.

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:42.570
I will take it as a compliment.

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:44.410
But we are recording today.

00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:46.500
So if you could keep the
snoring to a minimum,

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:48.960
that would be excellent.

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:50.580
So I thought just to start off.

00:00:50.580 --> 00:00:51.840
Before you have a quick nap.

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:53.860
I'm actually going to
get you to stand up.

00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:54.860
This is very deliberate.

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:57.660
It means extricating yourself
from your laptop or phone

00:00:57.660 --> 00:00:59.350
for a very short period of time.

00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:01.790
It's going to be OK.

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:03.450
And what I'd like
you to do is when

00:01:03.450 --> 00:01:08.040
you see a statement on the
screen, which is true for you

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:11.350
most of the time, I'd
like you to sit down.

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:12.330
OK.

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:15.750
So firstly, I rely on an
alarm clock to wake up.

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:17.110
Sort of mostly.

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:18.030
[LAUGHTER]

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:22.660
I fall asleep within five
minutes of getting into bed.

00:01:22.660 --> 00:01:26.770
I use caffeine to keep
me going through the day.

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:31.510
I can doze in long
meetings or talks.

00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:35.780
I sleep for longer at
the weekends to catch up.

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:38.250
And there are a few people
standing, which is excellent.

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:40.620
The vast majority of you
have come to the right place.

00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:43.950
For you guys, hopefully, you
will still learn even more.

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:45.950
Please have a seat.

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:47.700
It may not surprise
you to know that these

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:52.890
are all indicators of potential
sleep deprivation, which

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:55.410
from the looks of
things affects most

00:01:55.410 --> 00:01:57.940
of the people in this room.

00:01:57.940 --> 00:02:00.270
So experts have
kind of got together

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:02.970
to come up with a consensus
of how much sleep we actually

00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:03.670
need.

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:05.460
Now, sleep is a
biological characteristic.

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:07.800
There is a lot of
natural variation.

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:09.900
But when they collated
loads of studies

00:02:09.900 --> 00:02:11.390
together, what they
came up with is

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:14.610
that seven hours
is the recommended

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:18.220
minimum for optimal
health and functioning.

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:21.090
Now, most of us actually
lie in a broader range

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:22.720
between seven and nine hours.

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:25.740
But you can anchor the
scientific recommendation

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:29.960
on a minimum of seven
hours for most people.

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:32.605
But most studies that look
around the world at how much

00:02:32.605 --> 00:02:34.730
sleep people are getting--
this one's from the RAND

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:35.960
Corporation--

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:40.160
show that at least
40% of the population

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:42.920
in developed countries
is short of sleep.

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:45.320
So Japan, here,
hitting the sleepless

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:48.680
ranks very highly
followed by the US.

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:51.800
And even in the UK, at
least one in three of us

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:52.790
are short of sleep.

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:54.680
But what I tend to find
when I come and speak

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:57.350
to people about sleep
at a corporate setting

00:02:57.350 --> 00:03:01.700
is that probably the proportion
is considerably higher.

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:09.380
And this is pretty extraordinary
because you're all really quite

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:12.260
clever savvy people.

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:12.890
Yeah.

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:13.980
All of you.

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:16.310
And you've probably
heard an awful lot

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:18.740
about why sleep is
important, not just from me,

00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:22.220
but from some other more
established sleep evangelists.

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:25.293
So you've got some phenomenons
sort of books and speakers,

00:03:25.293 --> 00:03:26.960
people who are going
out and telling you

00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:29.060
just how important sleep is.

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:32.510
So if I could get you to
raise your hand if you have

00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:35.660
either read one of these
books or perhaps watched

00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:39.350
a talk, perhaps a Talks at
Google on the topic of sleep

00:03:39.350 --> 00:03:43.690
and how important sleep is in
the last three or four years.

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:46.070
OK, so once again,
quite a lot of people

00:03:46.070 --> 00:03:49.340
in the room, which means that
if I was to spend the next 30

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:53.090
minutes telling you about all
the things that could happen

00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:56.360
to you if you don't get
enough sleep, some of these

00:03:56.360 --> 00:03:59.740
are going to be quite familiar.

00:03:59.740 --> 00:04:03.510
Now, you could probably take
any single one of these and go,

00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:04.790
do you know what?

00:04:04.790 --> 00:04:08.330
This is really important to me.

00:04:08.330 --> 00:04:10.870
If one of these is
important to you,

00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:12.840
you it might want to
make you get more sleep.

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:17.899
But all of them together
collectively, surely the case

00:04:17.899 --> 00:04:22.010
for good sleep is overwhelming.

00:04:22.010 --> 00:04:28.040
And yet, time and time
again, we turn up tired.

00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:29.960
We turn up with enough sleep.

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:31.940
And really, what I want
to spend the next half

00:04:31.940 --> 00:04:34.670
hour talking about is why.

00:04:34.670 --> 00:04:40.550
Not why we sleep, but why
we're not getting enough sleep.

00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:43.790
And hopefully, by understanding
the behavioral science

00:04:43.790 --> 00:04:47.150
and the neuroscience, which is
actually preventing a lot of us

00:04:47.150 --> 00:04:50.030
from getting enough
sleep, we can then kind of

00:04:50.030 --> 00:04:51.530
give some recommendations
which will

00:04:51.530 --> 00:04:54.410
help you to get better
quality out of the time

00:04:54.410 --> 00:04:56.060
that you are sleeping.

00:04:56.060 --> 00:05:00.450
So in order to do this, we
need to go back in time.

00:05:00.450 --> 00:05:01.790
For many of you, not so long.

00:05:01.790 --> 00:05:05.150
For me, about 21 years,
give or take, to you

00:05:05.150 --> 00:05:08.030
were a baby, when
you were a newborn.

00:05:08.030 --> 00:05:10.970
Thank you, Richard,
for laughing.

00:05:10.970 --> 00:05:14.850
So when we are born,
nobody teaches us to sleep.

00:05:14.850 --> 00:05:17.550
We have an innate
ability to sleep.

00:05:17.550 --> 00:05:18.955
It is not a learned behavior.

00:05:18.955 --> 00:05:20.455
It's something that
is very natural.

00:05:20.455 --> 00:05:22.820
It's driven within us.

00:05:22.820 --> 00:05:25.590
And when you are a newborn,
it's really pretty simple.

00:05:25.590 --> 00:05:28.520
The longer you've
been awake or the more

00:05:28.520 --> 00:05:33.572
activity that you've done, the
greater the pressure to sleep.

00:05:33.572 --> 00:05:34.280
So remember that.

00:05:34.280 --> 00:05:37.430
Sleep pressure builds up the
longer that you're awake.

00:05:37.430 --> 00:05:41.890
And we still have this
influence influencing our sleep

00:05:41.890 --> 00:05:42.390
as adults.

00:05:42.390 --> 00:05:47.220
But as we get older, it's get
considerably more complicated.

00:05:47.220 --> 00:05:49.790
So around about
three months old,

00:05:49.790 --> 00:05:52.600
our body clocks
start to kick in.

00:05:52.600 --> 00:05:55.970
And I'll cover a bit more
about those a little bit later.

00:05:55.970 --> 00:05:58.730
But the other thing that
happens as we get older

00:05:58.730 --> 00:06:05.450
is that to we're able to
consciously override sleep.

00:06:05.450 --> 00:06:08.080
Those parents in
the room will know

00:06:08.080 --> 00:06:11.710
that this happens
with, unfortunately,

00:06:11.710 --> 00:06:13.410
a lot of frequency.

00:06:13.410 --> 00:06:16.090
But we're able to kind of kick
in this conscious override

00:06:16.090 --> 00:06:19.235
switch which enables us to
prevent sleep from occurring.

00:06:19.235 --> 00:06:21.610
Now, I'm very, very interested
in why this could possibly

00:06:21.610 --> 00:06:22.450
be the case.

00:06:22.450 --> 00:06:23.260
Let's face it.

00:06:23.260 --> 00:06:25.720
From an evolutionary
perspective,

00:06:25.720 --> 00:06:29.890
if sleep provides all
of those values, all

00:06:29.890 --> 00:06:33.040
of those kind of brilliant
protective influences

00:06:33.040 --> 00:06:35.290
on our health and
well-being, then why

00:06:35.290 --> 00:06:38.140
can we prevent sleep
from occurring?

00:06:38.140 --> 00:06:41.140
And for that, you kind of
need to go back even further.

00:06:43.750 --> 00:06:46.650
So our conscious
brains evolved probably

00:06:46.650 --> 00:06:51.000
around about 200,000
years ago, give or take.

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:53.970
And while our ancestors
were out on the savanna

00:06:53.970 --> 00:06:58.500
hunting and gathering,
that manual override switch

00:06:58.500 --> 00:07:00.730
was really helpful.

00:07:00.730 --> 00:07:02.610
So I mean if you went
back to our hunter

00:07:02.610 --> 00:07:05.160
gatherer days,
what type of things

00:07:05.160 --> 00:07:07.560
would have kept
you awake at night,

00:07:07.560 --> 00:07:12.645
would have made you kind of be
able to stay awake at night?

00:07:12.645 --> 00:07:14.520
What are you trying to
prevent from occurring

00:07:14.520 --> 00:07:17.225
if you're staying awake
in that sort of setting?

00:07:17.225 --> 00:07:18.600
AUDIENCE: Getting
eaten by lions.

00:07:18.600 --> 00:07:21.090
SOPHIE BOSTOCK: Getting
eaten, absolutely.

00:07:21.090 --> 00:07:21.840
Predators.

00:07:21.840 --> 00:07:23.865
Anything else?

00:07:23.865 --> 00:07:25.140
AUDIENCE: Weather.

00:07:25.140 --> 00:07:26.140
SOPHIE BOSTOCK: Weather.

00:07:26.140 --> 00:07:27.690
It could be awful storms.

00:07:27.690 --> 00:07:29.760
We were not protected
by a lovely building

00:07:29.760 --> 00:07:31.770
like this back in those days.

00:07:31.770 --> 00:07:35.460
I mean basically, it was all
about threats to survival.

00:07:35.460 --> 00:07:38.670
We needed to be able to
stay awake because we

00:07:38.670 --> 00:07:39.990
were defending ourselves.

00:07:39.990 --> 00:07:42.450
It was absolutely
protective from

00:07:42.450 --> 00:07:44.130
an evolutionary perspective.

00:07:44.130 --> 00:07:51.870
So our brains evolved to
learn that not sleeping means

00:07:51.870 --> 00:07:55.050
that we are under threat.

00:07:55.050 --> 00:07:57.670
That's really important.

00:07:57.670 --> 00:08:02.080
So inside the brain, threats
switch on this highly

00:08:02.080 --> 00:08:05.540
honed response to boost our
survival called the stress

00:08:05.540 --> 00:08:06.040
response.

00:08:06.040 --> 00:08:07.873
You probably come across
this, either called

00:08:07.873 --> 00:08:11.480
the stress response or the
fight or flight reflex.

00:08:11.480 --> 00:08:13.510
And what happens is
when we sense something

00:08:13.510 --> 00:08:16.270
that we're afraid of,
this little red bit

00:08:16.270 --> 00:08:19.360
almond shaped bit in the
middle, the amygdala,

00:08:19.360 --> 00:08:23.540
switches on this
cascade of reactions.

00:08:23.540 --> 00:08:27.670
So it pushes adrenaline
into the bloodstream.

00:08:27.670 --> 00:08:29.410
We get the heart pumping faster.

00:08:29.410 --> 00:08:30.550
Blood pressure raises.

00:08:30.550 --> 00:08:32.350
Muscles tense up.

00:08:32.350 --> 00:08:35.650
Over time, we also produce
the stress hormone cortisol.

00:08:35.650 --> 00:08:38.770
All of these things are
getting us raring to go,

00:08:38.770 --> 00:08:42.429
ready to either fight or flight.

00:08:42.429 --> 00:08:44.515
Very useful defensive response.

00:08:48.130 --> 00:08:52.110
The problem is these
days sleep deprivation

00:08:52.110 --> 00:08:56.210
may not be due to a
threat to our survival.

00:08:56.210 --> 00:08:57.930
We've all been there.

00:08:57.930 --> 00:09:00.390
Just one more episode.

00:09:00.390 --> 00:09:01.650
Just one more drink.

00:09:01.650 --> 00:09:04.502
Just 10 minutes more
on that presentation.

00:09:04.502 --> 00:09:05.460
It's not going to hurt.

00:09:05.460 --> 00:09:08.100
It's only 15, 20 minutes.

00:09:08.100 --> 00:09:12.360
We deliberately keep
ourselves awake past the time

00:09:12.360 --> 00:09:15.180
that our bodies are telling
us that we're sleepy,

00:09:15.180 --> 00:09:20.920
not realizing that we are
guilty of sleep sabotage.

00:09:20.920 --> 00:09:25.650
So evolution is simply
not ready for Netflix.

00:09:25.650 --> 00:09:30.830
By deliberately keeping us
awake and making ourselves

00:09:30.830 --> 00:09:34.780
over tired, we kick start
this stress response.

00:09:34.780 --> 00:09:37.980
We become hyper-vigilant,
hyper-aroused.

00:09:37.980 --> 00:09:40.550
And it's much harder
to get off to sleep.

00:09:40.550 --> 00:09:42.420
And even if we do
sleep, we actually

00:09:42.420 --> 00:09:44.070
enter a little sleep
because there's

00:09:44.070 --> 00:09:45.960
part of our brain
going, I don't want

00:09:45.960 --> 00:09:47.910
to be eaten by
saber tooth tiger.

00:09:47.910 --> 00:09:51.900
So we miss out on some of
that deep restorative sleep.

00:09:51.900 --> 00:09:55.370
To make things even worse,
in this survival mode,

00:09:55.370 --> 00:09:57.870
while our brain is busy
prioritizing what's

00:09:57.870 --> 00:10:00.810
going on in the amygdala,
it's switching off,

00:10:00.810 --> 00:10:04.740
turning down the amount
of energy it sends

00:10:04.740 --> 00:10:09.300
towards another part of our
brain, our prefrontal cortex,

00:10:09.300 --> 00:10:14.940
the bit that controls
self-regulatory capacity,

00:10:14.940 --> 00:10:19.230
our logical thought, our
goal directed behavior.

00:10:19.230 --> 00:10:22.680
The more short of sleep
you are, the less likely

00:10:22.680 --> 00:10:24.720
you are to be able
to stick to the goal

00:10:24.720 --> 00:10:26.790
that you meant to
make to fall asleep.

00:10:26.790 --> 00:10:31.140
It's literally a vicious cycle.

00:10:31.140 --> 00:10:34.610
So what can we do
to tackle sleep self

00:10:34.610 --> 00:10:38.240
sabotage, the over-tires brain?

00:10:38.240 --> 00:10:41.240
m it sounds very, very
obvious, if you are getting

00:10:41.240 --> 00:10:43.490
at least seven hours
sleep a night, hopefully,

00:10:43.490 --> 00:10:46.970
you're going to enter
that state less often.

00:10:46.970 --> 00:10:48.920
But I think what's key
here is whether or not

00:10:48.920 --> 00:10:51.570
you're getting seven hours
or a little bit less,

00:10:51.570 --> 00:10:54.000
make it a routine.

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:57.950
Reduce the cognitive load,
that decision making that says,

00:10:57.950 --> 00:11:01.040
shall I go to bed now or not?

00:11:01.040 --> 00:11:04.790
If you know that at
11:00 PM without fail,

00:11:04.790 --> 00:11:07.400
you are going to
sleep, well, it kind of

00:11:07.400 --> 00:11:09.340
doesn't give you
as many options.

00:11:09.340 --> 00:11:11.930
So it's about sticking
to a plan, making a plan

00:11:11.930 --> 00:11:14.030
and sticking to a plan.

00:11:14.030 --> 00:11:16.790
And then in the time before
bed, obviously, there

00:11:16.790 --> 00:11:19.310
are going to be times that
you have to stay up late.

00:11:19.310 --> 00:11:20.960
You've got stuff to finish.

00:11:20.960 --> 00:11:25.130
There's a really,
really good series on.

00:11:25.130 --> 00:11:28.648
Whenever you are ready to switch
off, don't just get into bed

00:11:28.648 --> 00:11:29.690
and switch out the light.

00:11:29.690 --> 00:11:32.000
Your brain is still active.

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:36.140
You owe yourself a period
of time to wind down.

00:11:36.140 --> 00:11:39.680
Now, in an ideal world, this
is quite a kind of routine

00:11:39.680 --> 00:11:41.360
that you go through.

00:11:41.360 --> 00:11:43.470
Maybe it takes an hour
on a typical night.

00:11:43.470 --> 00:11:45.180
So you might
declutter your room.

00:11:45.180 --> 00:11:47.180
You might put your clothes
out for the next day.

00:11:47.180 --> 00:11:49.190
You might lock the
doors in the house

00:11:49.190 --> 00:11:51.130
to make yourself
sort of feel secure.

00:11:51.130 --> 00:11:53.270
You might have a hot
shower, read a book.

00:11:53.270 --> 00:11:57.860
Whatever you do, if you do it
in the same order each night,

00:11:57.860 --> 00:12:02.150
when you tune into that routine,
there's a pattern recognition.

00:12:02.150 --> 00:12:05.300
The body recognizes that
you are safe and secure

00:12:05.300 --> 00:12:07.430
and you're going
to unwind for bed.

00:12:07.430 --> 00:12:10.010
If you repeat that on
enough days of the week,

00:12:10.010 --> 00:12:12.170
when it comes to
being sleep deprived,

00:12:12.170 --> 00:12:15.410
you can tap into a small
part of that routine

00:12:15.410 --> 00:12:16.490
and the brain kicks in.

00:12:16.490 --> 00:12:17.840
It goes, I know I'm safe.

00:12:17.840 --> 00:12:19.160
I know I'm secure.

00:12:19.160 --> 00:12:23.960
I can relax, wind down,
and be ready for bed.

00:12:23.960 --> 00:12:28.560
Finally, develop the
skill of relaxation.

00:12:28.560 --> 00:12:31.100
So I was at yoga this
morning developing

00:12:31.100 --> 00:12:33.020
my skill of relaxation.

00:12:33.020 --> 00:12:36.410
And the yoga
teacher said, you've

00:12:36.410 --> 00:12:38.810
got to put some effort
in, when we were just

00:12:38.810 --> 00:12:40.700
sort of lying now on
the ground breathing.

00:12:40.700 --> 00:12:42.050
And I thought, really?

00:12:42.050 --> 00:12:45.110
I mean surely relaxation
is just relaxation.

00:12:45.110 --> 00:12:49.280
Relaxation is actually
an effortful procedure.

00:12:49.280 --> 00:12:52.160
It's not just about lying down
worrying about the presentation

00:12:52.160 --> 00:12:54.590
that you've got to give in a
few hours time it's actually

00:12:54.590 --> 00:12:58.400
about focusing your attention,
focusing your attention

00:12:58.400 --> 00:13:00.680
on the breath,
making sure that you

00:13:00.680 --> 00:13:03.110
are slowing the breath down.

00:13:03.110 --> 00:13:05.540
The technique that you
use doesn't really matter,

00:13:05.540 --> 00:13:07.590
whether it's
mindfulness meditation,

00:13:07.590 --> 00:13:13.280
yoga, any form of relaxing
activity, progressive muscle

00:13:13.280 --> 00:13:14.780
relaxation.

00:13:14.780 --> 00:13:18.680
All of these things will help
the mind to detach and the body

00:13:18.680 --> 00:13:19.740
to relax.

00:13:19.740 --> 00:13:22.490
You're trying to reset
that stress response.

00:13:25.320 --> 00:13:27.150
I front loaded quite
a lot of science

00:13:27.150 --> 00:13:30.250
there in case some of you fell
asleep a little bit later on.

00:13:30.250 --> 00:13:32.970
So we'll move on to
the second reason

00:13:32.970 --> 00:13:36.960
that I believe that a lot of
us don't get enough sleep.

00:13:36.960 --> 00:13:41.160
And I like to call this
blissful ignorance.

00:13:41.160 --> 00:13:43.290
So a lot of you
walked into the room

00:13:43.290 --> 00:13:45.330
knowing that you
want more sleep,

00:13:45.330 --> 00:13:47.670
knowing that you're
not getting enough.

00:13:47.670 --> 00:13:52.260
But I suspect that you
are underestimating just

00:13:52.260 --> 00:13:56.440
how harmful the impact
is on your daily life.

00:13:56.440 --> 00:13:57.312
Why do I say this?

00:13:57.312 --> 00:13:58.770
Well, there have
been a few studies

00:13:58.770 --> 00:14:02.040
looking at the impact of
a certain amount of sleep

00:14:02.040 --> 00:14:06.280
on both objective performance
and subjective performance,

00:14:06.280 --> 00:14:07.320
which I'll explain.

00:14:07.320 --> 00:14:09.450
So this particular study,
they got some volunteers

00:14:09.450 --> 00:14:12.280
and they split them
into four groups.

00:14:12.280 --> 00:14:15.130
The first group got
no time in bed at all

00:14:15.130 --> 00:14:17.620
and they had to try and
maintain that for three days.

00:14:17.620 --> 00:14:20.220
The other groups, four hours
in bed, six hours in bed,

00:14:20.220 --> 00:14:21.750
eight hours in bed.

00:14:21.750 --> 00:14:24.030
So you know how much
sleep you regularly get.

00:14:24.030 --> 00:14:26.700
You can kind of put yourself
into one of these groups,

00:14:26.700 --> 00:14:28.830
whichever is closest.

00:14:28.830 --> 00:14:31.860
And during the course of
the 14 day experiment,

00:14:31.860 --> 00:14:34.798
they got people to test
their level of alertness.

00:14:34.798 --> 00:14:36.840
And the way that they did
this is using something

00:14:36.840 --> 00:14:39.420
called the psychomotor
vigilance task.

00:14:39.420 --> 00:14:42.780
All that happens, you
sit looking at a screen

00:14:42.780 --> 00:14:45.690
and some numbers flash onto it.

00:14:45.690 --> 00:14:47.140
It's incredibly simple.

00:14:47.140 --> 00:14:49.290
All you have to do
is press a button

00:14:49.290 --> 00:14:52.930
when you see the
number occurring.

00:14:52.930 --> 00:14:55.660
So you can make an error
by not pressing the button

00:14:55.660 --> 00:14:58.140
or by pressing the button
when there is no number.

00:14:58.140 --> 00:15:00.330
So it's very much
a very simple test

00:15:00.330 --> 00:15:04.120
of alertness and concentration.

00:15:04.120 --> 00:15:06.810
So this is what happened
to the number of errors

00:15:06.810 --> 00:15:12.220
that people made over
the 14 day experiment.

00:15:12.220 --> 00:15:14.130
So first of all,
we see the group

00:15:14.130 --> 00:15:18.030
that got no time in bed at all
very rapidly increasing number

00:15:18.030 --> 00:15:19.650
of mistakes that they made.

00:15:19.650 --> 00:15:23.130
The eight hours in bed group,
not too much significant change

00:15:23.130 --> 00:15:24.100
over time.

00:15:24.100 --> 00:15:26.010
But what you can
see very clearly

00:15:26.010 --> 00:15:29.270
is that there is this kind of
dose response relationship.

00:15:29.270 --> 00:15:31.860
The less sleep that you're
getting, the more likely

00:15:31.860 --> 00:15:33.360
you are to make mistakes.

00:15:33.360 --> 00:15:39.030
But what's really significant is
that this builds up every night

00:15:39.030 --> 00:15:41.720
that you are short of sleep.

00:15:41.720 --> 00:15:44.330
The effects of
sleeplessness accumulate.

00:15:44.330 --> 00:15:47.000
And this is what we
call a sleep debt.

00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:52.230
This is something you
can build up over time.

00:15:52.230 --> 00:15:54.600
This kind of makes sense.

00:15:54.600 --> 00:15:56.120
But what's really
worrying is what

00:15:56.120 --> 00:16:00.650
happened when we asked
people how sleepy they are.

00:16:00.650 --> 00:16:05.060
So this is subjective
perception of your sleepiness.

00:16:05.060 --> 00:16:08.960
So again, if you've got no
sleep, you know you're sleepy.

00:16:08.960 --> 00:16:12.560
But the four hours and
six hours people, they

00:16:12.560 --> 00:16:15.620
didn't report feeling any
different to each other.

00:16:15.620 --> 00:16:19.680
And what's worse
is after 10 days,

00:16:19.680 --> 00:16:23.720
they didn't really think that
their level of impairment

00:16:23.720 --> 00:16:27.480
was any worse than it
was after three or four.

00:16:27.480 --> 00:16:30.120
They are telling
themselves, like many of us

00:16:30.120 --> 00:16:34.320
do, that they've
adapted, that they're OK,

00:16:34.320 --> 00:16:35.940
that they're coping.

00:16:35.940 --> 00:16:40.890
But the objective data tells
a very different story.

00:16:40.890 --> 00:16:43.580
So we may well be
underestimating

00:16:43.580 --> 00:16:46.610
the impact of sleeplessness.

00:16:46.610 --> 00:16:51.200
Just to make it just a teeny
bit harder, as many of you

00:16:51.200 --> 00:16:53.330
will know if you heard
Matthew Walker's talk,

00:16:53.330 --> 00:16:57.500
sleep is absolutely essential
for learning and memory.

00:16:57.500 --> 00:16:59.908
As you learn new
stuff during the day,

00:16:59.908 --> 00:17:01.700
hopefully as you're
sitting here picking up

00:17:01.700 --> 00:17:04.700
a few nuggets of
information, your brain

00:17:04.700 --> 00:17:07.088
is actually expanding
with the knowledge.

00:17:07.088 --> 00:17:07.880
It's like a sponge.

00:17:07.880 --> 00:17:11.119
It can only suck up
a certain amount.

00:17:11.119 --> 00:17:14.660
And sleep is the
process which returns

00:17:14.660 --> 00:17:18.260
the kind of really interesting
emotionally resonant memories

00:17:18.260 --> 00:17:20.970
into your long term memory.

00:17:20.970 --> 00:17:24.170
And it also recharges
that short term memory,

00:17:24.170 --> 00:17:27.359
allowing you to
learn new things.

00:17:27.359 --> 00:17:30.850
So if you're not
sleeping terribly well

00:17:30.850 --> 00:17:34.080
and it's having an impact
on your performance,

00:17:34.080 --> 00:17:35.900
you might not
remember it tomorrow.

00:17:35.900 --> 00:17:37.670
You'll probably tell
yourself that you're

00:17:37.670 --> 00:17:40.140
going to adapt all over again.

00:17:40.140 --> 00:17:41.750
And people can just
get in this cycle

00:17:41.750 --> 00:17:43.540
where they're not actually--

00:17:43.540 --> 00:17:46.610
they can't really remember
what it was like to sleep well.

00:17:46.610 --> 00:17:49.070
They just tell themselves
that they're coping.

00:17:49.070 --> 00:17:51.640
You've got to kind
of break this cycle

00:17:51.640 --> 00:17:56.410
and remember what it's like
to have a good night's sleep.

00:17:56.410 --> 00:17:58.580
So how do we do that?

00:17:58.580 --> 00:18:02.320
Well, first things first, you've
got to repay that sleep debt.

00:18:02.320 --> 00:18:06.940
The good news is you do not
need to repay it hour for hour.

00:18:06.940 --> 00:18:08.870
The body is very adaptable.

00:18:08.870 --> 00:18:09.910
It's very clever.

00:18:09.910 --> 00:18:11.830
If you've had a really
poor night's sleep,

00:18:11.830 --> 00:18:14.890
the next night it will
slip into a deeper sleep.

00:18:14.890 --> 00:18:17.260
You'll have more of
the REM sleep, which

00:18:17.260 --> 00:18:19.750
helps to recharge your
emotions and memories.

00:18:19.750 --> 00:18:21.800
So there is an
adaptability there.

00:18:21.800 --> 00:18:24.400
It's just that if you're
constantly short of sleep

00:18:24.400 --> 00:18:26.960
you're not allowing
the brain to recharge.

00:18:26.960 --> 00:18:28.210
So repay the sleep debt.

00:18:28.210 --> 00:18:30.400
Take a vacation.

00:18:30.400 --> 00:18:32.170
Make sure that you've
got several days

00:18:32.170 --> 00:18:34.570
when you can actually sleep
for as long as you like.

00:18:34.570 --> 00:18:36.070
And then you got
to work out what's

00:18:36.070 --> 00:18:38.000
your natural sleep window.

00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:41.140
So if you were to go to bed each
night when your eyelids start

00:18:41.140 --> 00:18:44.380
to get tired and wake
up without an alarm,

00:18:44.380 --> 00:18:47.218
how much sleep is that?

00:18:47.218 --> 00:18:49.510
And some of you will go,
well, I do that on the weekend

00:18:49.510 --> 00:18:50.860
and it's 10 or 11 hours.

00:18:50.860 --> 00:18:53.110
I can't have 10 or 11 hours.

00:18:53.110 --> 00:18:54.910
And that's because
you're repaying

00:18:54.910 --> 00:18:57.208
some of your missing
sleep debt from the week.

00:18:57.208 --> 00:18:58.750
You've got to give
yourself a chance.

00:18:58.750 --> 00:19:00.790
Definitely, I would
recommend a vacation.

00:19:00.790 --> 00:19:02.920
Always recommend that.

00:19:02.920 --> 00:19:07.240
Once you have your sleep
window, first thing to do

00:19:07.240 --> 00:19:10.030
is set a routine wake time.

00:19:10.030 --> 00:19:12.610
Set your time that
you can get up

00:19:12.610 --> 00:19:15.820
sort of 90% of the time
within an hour or so.

00:19:15.820 --> 00:19:17.470
And once you've
started adapting that--

00:19:17.470 --> 00:19:20.560
we'll talk in the next bit about
the body clock and how helpful

00:19:20.560 --> 00:19:21.400
that can be--

00:19:21.400 --> 00:19:26.110
but can you find a time where
your body wakes up naturally

00:19:26.110 --> 00:19:28.960
so you're not constantly
reliant on an alarm?

00:19:28.960 --> 00:19:31.100
That's a good indicator
to you that you

00:19:31.100 --> 00:19:34.600
are getting enough sleep.

00:19:34.600 --> 00:19:37.210
And if you can't get
that seven hours all

00:19:37.210 --> 00:19:40.510
in one block at night,
do not be afraid to nap.

00:19:40.510 --> 00:19:42.850
I know that Google is
renowned for having

00:19:42.850 --> 00:19:44.290
invested in napping pods.

00:19:44.290 --> 00:19:47.590
You've got some really great
environments in the workspace

00:19:47.590 --> 00:19:51.110
where you can actually
go and take a power nap.

00:19:51.110 --> 00:19:54.430
Now, a power nap is so called,
as many of you will know,

00:19:54.430 --> 00:19:59.590
because roughly around about
20 to 25 minutes will get you

00:19:59.590 --> 00:20:02.350
into a deep enough
sleep to restore

00:20:02.350 --> 00:20:07.510
your cognitive functions, give
your mood a boost in terms

00:20:07.510 --> 00:20:09.610
of sort of happiness
and well-being,

00:20:09.610 --> 00:20:13.690
but it's not long enough
to drift into deep sleep.

00:20:13.690 --> 00:20:15.850
Typically, after
about 45 minutes or so

00:20:15.850 --> 00:20:17.300
you get into a deep sleep.

00:20:17.300 --> 00:20:19.550
And if you wake up
from deep sleep,

00:20:19.550 --> 00:20:21.490
you are properly out of it.

00:20:21.490 --> 00:20:23.470
You've got this thing
called sleep inertia

00:20:23.470 --> 00:20:26.480
and it can take you a full
hour to wake up again.

00:20:26.480 --> 00:20:29.340
So if you're going to
nap, my advice would be--

00:20:29.340 --> 00:20:31.690
as we'll see in a moment,
do it in the circadian

00:20:31.690 --> 00:20:36.830
low after lunch and keep
it to 15 to 20 minutes.

00:20:36.830 --> 00:20:39.320
OK.

00:20:39.320 --> 00:20:42.290
So that's blissful ignorance
about lack of sleep.

00:20:42.290 --> 00:20:47.520
Why else are we not
sleeping enough?

00:20:47.520 --> 00:20:48.750
You heard it here first.

00:20:48.750 --> 00:20:51.150
You've heard of the
obesogenic environment.

00:20:51.150 --> 00:20:52.800
Now I would like
to propose to you

00:20:52.800 --> 00:20:55.067
the sleeplessogenic
suggested environment, which

00:20:55.067 --> 00:20:57.150
maybe doesn't rattle off
the tongue quite so well.

00:20:57.150 --> 00:21:00.720
But I'm sure you can imagine
what I'm talking about.

00:21:03.540 --> 00:21:06.050
So back on the savanna
as hunter gatherers,

00:21:06.050 --> 00:21:08.180
before we had
watches and phones,

00:21:08.180 --> 00:21:11.480
we used to rely on the sun
to tell us what time of day

00:21:11.480 --> 00:21:12.260
it was.

00:21:12.260 --> 00:21:14.870
And we evolved our
level of activity

00:21:14.870 --> 00:21:17.450
to be guided very
much by the sun.

00:21:17.450 --> 00:21:20.540
So our alertness follows
this sort of pattern.

00:21:20.540 --> 00:21:23.270
As we wake up in the morning,
our alertness sort of

00:21:23.270 --> 00:21:26.210
boosts right up
until about midday.

00:21:26.210 --> 00:21:28.940
After lunch, we have
this circadian low,

00:21:28.940 --> 00:21:31.130
sometime between about
1:00 PM and 3:00 PM

00:21:31.130 --> 00:21:34.130
where our energy levels dip.

00:21:34.130 --> 00:21:36.530
That's just innate within us.

00:21:36.530 --> 00:21:38.720
Then we pick up as it's
time to go home from work.

00:21:38.720 --> 00:21:43.010
And as it starts to get dark,
our energy levels start to dip.

00:21:43.010 --> 00:21:46.180
And that's when naturally
we feel more sleepy.

00:21:49.910 --> 00:21:52.800
But the remarkable
thing about this pattern

00:21:52.800 --> 00:21:57.710
is that even if you take
light, sunlight away,

00:21:57.710 --> 00:21:59.005
this pattern persists.

00:22:02.430 --> 00:22:04.998
So if you were to take
any cell from your body

00:22:04.998 --> 00:22:06.540
and put it in a
Petri dish and put it

00:22:06.540 --> 00:22:08.910
in a cupboard with all
the things that it needed,

00:22:08.910 --> 00:22:13.290
it would actually operate
on a 24-hour rhythm.

00:22:13.290 --> 00:22:15.720
Same thing would happen to
you if you went and lived

00:22:15.720 --> 00:22:18.443
in a cave underground
for two months.

00:22:18.443 --> 00:22:20.110
You might not think
this is a good idea,

00:22:20.110 --> 00:22:22.000
but a French guy
actually went and did it.

00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:27.630
And he was able to show that his
circadian rhythm persisted even

00:22:27.630 --> 00:22:29.460
in the absence of light.

00:22:29.460 --> 00:22:32.610
Now, the fact is circadian
rhythm ended up being about 24

00:22:32.610 --> 00:22:34.020
and 1/2 hours.

00:22:34.020 --> 00:22:37.050
So after a couple of
months, he was out of sync

00:22:37.050 --> 00:22:40.820
with the external environment.

00:22:40.820 --> 00:22:43.120
But it was through
exposure to light

00:22:43.120 --> 00:22:46.960
that he was able to then, as he
returned to the outside world,

00:22:46.960 --> 00:22:49.670
bring his body
clock back on track.

00:22:49.670 --> 00:22:53.560
So we have literally
trillions of these body clocks

00:22:53.560 --> 00:22:58.390
all around our body trying to
operate on a 24-hour rhythm.

00:22:58.390 --> 00:23:00.920
Some of them are more
active during the night.

00:23:00.920 --> 00:23:03.610
So growth hormone, for example,
gets produced during the night.

00:23:03.610 --> 00:23:07.150
It's a really strong time
for growth and repair,

00:23:07.150 --> 00:23:09.907
whereas obviously, our
conscious functions

00:23:09.907 --> 00:23:10.990
are switched off at night.

00:23:10.990 --> 00:23:12.450
We produce less urine.

00:23:12.450 --> 00:23:17.540
Our blood pressure
goes down, for example.

00:23:17.540 --> 00:23:21.280
So in order for the body
to work most efficiently,

00:23:21.280 --> 00:23:24.070
we want all of our body
clocks to work in tune.

00:23:24.070 --> 00:23:25.570
And you will know
if you've ever had

00:23:25.570 --> 00:23:28.360
jet lag what happens when
your body clocks start

00:23:28.360 --> 00:23:30.980
to be out of sync
with each other

00:23:30.980 --> 00:23:33.740
and with the
external environment.

00:23:33.740 --> 00:23:38.200
So light is an incredibly
powerful driver

00:23:38.200 --> 00:23:41.980
for coordinating our body
clocks altogether, making us

00:23:41.980 --> 00:23:43.660
work efficiently.

00:23:43.660 --> 00:23:47.540
And darkness,
conversely, is what

00:23:47.540 --> 00:23:50.030
enables the body to
produce melatonin,

00:23:50.030 --> 00:23:55.640
the hormone that signals to the
body that it's time to sleep.

00:23:55.640 --> 00:23:58.370
So we have this
alerting function,

00:23:58.370 --> 00:24:00.070
which sort of gets
stronger and stronger

00:24:00.070 --> 00:24:02.840
as the light gets brighter
and drops away at night.

00:24:05.350 --> 00:24:08.140
And then I mentioned
earlier, as babies

00:24:08.140 --> 00:24:10.840
we have this sleep pressure that
builds up the longer that we've

00:24:10.840 --> 00:24:11.720
been awake.

00:24:11.720 --> 00:24:15.790
So actually, as adults,
both of these two drivers

00:24:15.790 --> 00:24:18.970
working to control
our level of alertness

00:24:18.970 --> 00:24:21.320
at one time or another.

00:24:21.320 --> 00:24:24.190
Now, interestingly for
this sleep pressure,

00:24:24.190 --> 00:24:26.880
there is a way to block that.

00:24:26.880 --> 00:24:31.216
Any ideas what will block
your sleep pressure?

00:24:31.216 --> 00:24:32.440
AUDIENCE: Caffeine.

00:24:32.440 --> 00:24:34.713
SOPHIE BOSTOCK:
Caffeine, absolutely.

00:24:34.713 --> 00:24:36.130
So what's actually
happening there

00:24:36.130 --> 00:24:38.110
is as sleep pressure
builds up, is

00:24:38.110 --> 00:24:41.560
that you have this waste product
from activity called adenosine

00:24:41.560 --> 00:24:44.680
that just builds up in the
brain and makes you feel drowsy.

00:24:44.680 --> 00:24:47.805
And caffeine
basically muscles in

00:24:47.805 --> 00:24:51.560
and masks the
adenosine receptors.

00:24:51.560 --> 00:24:54.740
So you don't actually feel
that same level of drowsiness.

00:24:54.740 --> 00:24:57.040
At the same time, it's
upping your stress hormones,

00:24:57.040 --> 00:25:00.430
making you feel light
and jittery and alert.

00:25:00.430 --> 00:25:05.230
But when the caffeine degrades,
the adenosine is still there.

00:25:05.230 --> 00:25:06.660
It hasn't gone anywhere.

00:25:06.660 --> 00:25:11.590
And so you can get this wave of
tiredness, this caffeine crash

00:25:11.590 --> 00:25:13.902
from all the adenosine
that's been building up.

00:25:13.902 --> 00:25:15.360
But you've been
masking its effects

00:25:15.360 --> 00:25:18.280
so you didn't realize how
tired you really were.

00:25:23.850 --> 00:25:26.880
So the environment that
most of us now work in,

00:25:26.880 --> 00:25:29.230
this is not the savanna.

00:25:29.230 --> 00:25:33.120
This might well be YouTube
or Google or pretty much

00:25:33.120 --> 00:25:36.153
any office around the world.

00:25:36.153 --> 00:25:38.820
What can you see here that might
interfere with either your body

00:25:38.820 --> 00:25:41.236
clock or your sleep drive?

00:25:41.236 --> 00:25:42.944
AUDIENCE: Lights.

00:25:42.944 --> 00:25:43.680
[INAUDIBLE]

00:25:43.680 --> 00:25:44.638
SOPHIE BOSTOCK: Lights.

00:25:44.638 --> 00:25:46.200
Lots of light,
lots of technology.

00:25:46.200 --> 00:25:51.130
So it turns out that the
brilliant designers of laptops,

00:25:51.130 --> 00:25:53.640
phones, they
typically like to use

00:25:53.640 --> 00:25:57.990
the same wavelength of light,
blue light, which mirrors

00:25:57.990 --> 00:26:01.740
the midday sun, the
strongest alerting

00:26:01.740 --> 00:26:04.470
signal that you can get.

00:26:04.470 --> 00:26:06.870
And you've also got
sort of caffeine.

00:26:06.870 --> 00:26:10.050
You've also got people
grazing through the day.

00:26:10.050 --> 00:26:12.960
One of the things the body
clock likes is routine.

00:26:12.960 --> 00:26:15.540
It likes to know the times
where you can actually

00:26:15.540 --> 00:26:18.680
sit and rest and digest a meal.

00:26:18.680 --> 00:26:22.425
It is going to depower
your stress response system

00:26:22.425 --> 00:26:24.300
because you're forcing
it to kind of properly

00:26:24.300 --> 00:26:27.075
stop, rest, and digest.

00:26:27.075 --> 00:26:30.390
If you graze, you don't
have those same intervals

00:26:30.390 --> 00:26:33.330
through the day.

00:26:33.330 --> 00:26:36.280
The sleeplessogenic environment.

00:26:36.280 --> 00:26:38.760
So what can you do if
you are out of sync

00:26:38.760 --> 00:26:40.470
with your body clock?

00:26:40.470 --> 00:26:42.930
I know I've already
mentioned having a routine.

00:26:42.930 --> 00:26:47.580
But this really is incredibly
important to help your body.

00:26:47.580 --> 00:26:50.400
If your routine is haphazard--

00:26:50.400 --> 00:26:54.420
so sometimes you go to bed
at 11:00, sometimes 1:00--

00:26:54.420 --> 00:26:58.470
your body doesn't know
when to produce melatonin.

00:26:58.470 --> 00:26:59.670
So it just doesn't.

00:26:59.670 --> 00:27:02.010
It just kind of holds back.

00:27:02.010 --> 00:27:04.530
Whereas if you have
a regular routine,

00:27:04.530 --> 00:27:06.960
your body can anticipate
what's going to happen.

00:27:06.960 --> 00:27:07.560
It can help.

00:27:07.560 --> 00:27:11.520
It will make you feel tired
at the same times each day.

00:27:11.520 --> 00:27:13.320
We've mentioned lights.

00:27:13.320 --> 00:27:15.750
One of the best things
is just to go outside.

00:27:15.750 --> 00:27:18.630
I'm sorry that I'm keeping
you inside this lunchtime.

00:27:18.630 --> 00:27:20.380
Hopefully, we'll finish
a little bit early

00:27:20.380 --> 00:27:25.650
and you can go out and soup up
a lot of nice natural sunlight

00:27:25.650 --> 00:27:27.810
to keep you going.

00:27:27.810 --> 00:27:31.110
Caffeine, obviously, I've
said masks your sleep drive.

00:27:31.110 --> 00:27:33.580
So I'm not saying don't use it.

00:27:33.580 --> 00:27:36.600
It could also be really
good for alertness.

00:27:36.600 --> 00:27:39.120
But use it strategically.

00:27:39.120 --> 00:27:44.100
Be aware that the half life
of caffeine is six hours.

00:27:44.100 --> 00:27:46.290
So six hours later,
you've still got

00:27:46.290 --> 00:27:48.450
half of the kind
of virulence, half

00:27:48.450 --> 00:27:51.713
of the power of that cup of
coffee in your bloodstream.

00:27:51.713 --> 00:27:53.130
The recommendation
in this country

00:27:53.130 --> 00:27:56.070
is you shouldn't have
more than 400 milligrams

00:27:56.070 --> 00:27:58.180
of caffeine in a day.

00:27:58.180 --> 00:28:02.000
That's about two or three
cups of filtered coffee or two

00:28:02.000 --> 00:28:04.070
Starbucks, I think.

00:28:04.070 --> 00:28:06.570
So just be really aware
of how much you're having.

00:28:06.570 --> 00:28:09.470
And if you need pepping
up, try sunlight

00:28:09.470 --> 00:28:11.960
or try other natural energizers.

00:28:11.960 --> 00:28:16.760
So exercise actually tends
to kickstart the body clock.

00:28:16.760 --> 00:28:18.770
Social interaction.

00:28:18.770 --> 00:28:20.180
Stop and have a chat.

00:28:20.180 --> 00:28:23.160
It's really-- it really
gets your body clock going.

00:28:23.160 --> 00:28:24.580
It makes you feel
naturally alert.

00:28:28.050 --> 00:28:28.570
OK.

00:28:28.570 --> 00:28:32.050
Finally, the final reason
that I think a lot of us

00:28:32.050 --> 00:28:35.030
really can't sleep.

00:28:35.030 --> 00:28:38.060
And that's insomnia.

00:28:38.060 --> 00:28:40.090
So most of those
other reasons, there's

00:28:40.090 --> 00:28:42.070
at least a voluntary element.

00:28:42.070 --> 00:28:45.730
We are making choices, which
are depriving us of sleep.

00:28:45.730 --> 00:28:47.290
But for some of
you in the room, I

00:28:47.290 --> 00:28:51.070
am sure you're sitting there
going, I've tried all this

00:28:51.070 --> 00:28:53.590
and I still can't sleep.

00:28:53.590 --> 00:28:57.190
Insomnia is a condition where
you can't get off to sleep,

00:28:57.190 --> 00:28:59.110
you can't stay
asleep, or you wake up

00:28:59.110 --> 00:29:03.280
feeling unrefreshed for at least
three nights a week or more

00:29:03.280 --> 00:29:05.420
for three months or more.

00:29:05.420 --> 00:29:08.640
So very much a
chronic condition.

00:29:08.640 --> 00:29:11.440
And what tends to happen is
that just like many of us,

00:29:11.440 --> 00:29:16.450
there's some sort of stress that
temporarily stops you sleeping.

00:29:16.450 --> 00:29:19.480
But this lack of
sleep actually becomes

00:29:19.480 --> 00:29:22.930
a source of stress and anxiety.

00:29:22.930 --> 00:29:26.020
Often, people with insomnia even
going into their own bedroom,

00:29:26.020 --> 00:29:28.550
they start to feel anxious.

00:29:28.550 --> 00:29:30.340
So what do you do
if you're trying

00:29:30.340 --> 00:29:32.840
to cope with a lot of
stress and anxiety?

00:29:32.840 --> 00:29:35.830
There's usually some sort
of behavioral compensation.

00:29:35.830 --> 00:29:37.600
For some of us, it's alcohol.

00:29:37.600 --> 00:29:38.910
We need to relax.

00:29:38.910 --> 00:29:41.350
And actually, alcohol--
yep, it does make

00:29:41.350 --> 00:29:43.350
us relax in the short term.

00:29:43.350 --> 00:29:47.140
Unfortunately, it totally
messes with your natural sleep

00:29:47.140 --> 00:29:48.310
architecture.

00:29:48.310 --> 00:29:51.250
You don't get the same
level of restorative sleep.

00:29:51.250 --> 00:29:53.620
So you wake up
feeling unrefreshed.

00:29:53.620 --> 00:29:55.690
Also messes with your memory.

00:29:55.690 --> 00:29:59.110
So it makes people think
that they're coping.

00:29:59.110 --> 00:30:02.050
But actually, it
makes the sleep worse.

00:30:02.050 --> 00:30:03.430
And so then they
start to believe

00:30:03.430 --> 00:30:04.840
that they'll never sleep again.

00:30:04.840 --> 00:30:08.470
These very unhelpful thoughts
and cognitions, defeatism

00:30:08.470 --> 00:30:11.530
around sleep, very
often insomnia

00:30:11.530 --> 00:30:14.620
increases the risk of anxiety,
depression, as well as

00:30:14.620 --> 00:30:18.670
a number of other
stress-related illnesses.

00:30:18.670 --> 00:30:23.115
So you get into this state of
chronic physical and mental

00:30:23.115 --> 00:30:25.320
hyperarousal.

00:30:25.320 --> 00:30:28.080
If you put someone with
insomnia into a brain scanner

00:30:28.080 --> 00:30:31.410
what you'll see is that
their brain is more active--

00:30:31.410 --> 00:30:35.950
not just during the
day, but also at night.

00:30:35.950 --> 00:30:40.110
So you've got to be able
to redress the balance.

00:30:40.110 --> 00:30:44.920
I mentioned earlier this fight
or flight stress response.

00:30:44.920 --> 00:30:46.740
So we have two arms
of this thing called

00:30:46.740 --> 00:30:48.450
the autonomic
nervous system, which

00:30:48.450 --> 00:30:51.570
controls all of our
unconscious functions

00:30:51.570 --> 00:30:55.700
like breathing, and our heart
rate, and our digestion.

00:30:55.700 --> 00:30:57.450
And in insomnia,
you've kind of got--

00:30:57.450 --> 00:31:01.170
you're overloading this fight
or flight stress response.

00:31:01.170 --> 00:31:03.450
And what you want
to do is wake up

00:31:03.450 --> 00:31:07.020
this parasympathetic
converse action

00:31:07.020 --> 00:31:11.810
of the body for rest and digest.

00:31:11.810 --> 00:31:13.840
So what can you do?

00:31:13.840 --> 00:31:18.550
Basically, you've got to tackle
both the thoughts associated

00:31:18.550 --> 00:31:22.210
with insomnia-- the unhelpful
sleep thoughts-- and also

00:31:22.210 --> 00:31:25.510
the behaviors that
are making it persist.

00:31:25.510 --> 00:31:29.710
So there's a couple of quick
techniques I can give you--

00:31:29.710 --> 00:31:32.470
a cognitive technique,
putting the day to rest.

00:31:32.470 --> 00:31:34.580
This is very, very simple.

00:31:34.580 --> 00:31:36.150
It's free.

00:31:36.150 --> 00:31:40.000
And it involves a piece
of paper and a pen.

00:31:40.000 --> 00:31:44.410
So when you are doing that
wind down routine before bed,

00:31:44.410 --> 00:31:46.450
protect five or 10 minutes.

00:31:46.450 --> 00:31:49.900
Sit down with a piece of
paper and your pencil,

00:31:49.900 --> 00:31:53.210
and write down what's worrying
you-- just what's on your mind,

00:31:53.210 --> 00:31:57.150
what you're thinking about
that you need to do tomorrow.

00:31:57.150 --> 00:31:59.150
Make sure that you
commit it to paper

00:31:59.150 --> 00:32:03.380
and put it next to your bed
so that if you are lying there

00:32:03.380 --> 00:32:05.630
trying to get to sleep but
these thoughts keep popping

00:32:05.630 --> 00:32:07.422
into your mind, you
can just tell yourself,

00:32:07.422 --> 00:32:08.870
it's on the page.

00:32:08.870 --> 00:32:10.610
It will still be there tomorrow.

00:32:10.610 --> 00:32:13.070
You do not need to
think about it now.

00:32:13.070 --> 00:32:16.200
It almost sounds too
simple to be effective.

00:32:16.200 --> 00:32:19.700
But one trial found that even
this simple intervention alone

00:32:19.700 --> 00:32:22.940
could increase, significantly,
people's ability

00:32:22.940 --> 00:32:24.883
to fall asleep.

00:32:24.883 --> 00:32:27.050
But there are behavioral
techniques as well-- so all

00:32:27.050 --> 00:32:30.540
of the things that I've already
mentioned, plus some extras.

00:32:30.540 --> 00:32:34.730
So there's one called
the Quarter Hour Rule.

00:32:34.730 --> 00:32:41.060
If you are in bed unable to
sleep for more than 15 minutes,

00:32:41.060 --> 00:32:42.550
get up.

00:32:42.550 --> 00:32:45.250
Get out of your room,
go somewhere else

00:32:45.250 --> 00:32:50.500
until you feel your eyelids
heavy and starting to close.

00:32:50.500 --> 00:32:54.160
What you want to do is break
any sort of negative connection

00:32:54.160 --> 00:32:56.170
between yourself,
and your bedroom,

00:32:56.170 --> 00:32:58.480
and being unable to sleep.

00:32:58.480 --> 00:33:02.740
Your bedroom should be this
haven for sleep and intimacy.

00:33:02.740 --> 00:33:03.400
That's allowed.

00:33:06.790 --> 00:33:09.880
And everything that I've been
talking about today-- all

00:33:09.880 --> 00:33:14.260
the tips, all the science--
is actually part of a toolkit

00:33:14.260 --> 00:33:18.190
that we call CBT, cognitive
behavioral therapy

00:33:18.190 --> 00:33:19.357
for insomnia.

00:33:19.357 --> 00:33:21.190
And it's actually the
recommended first-line

00:33:21.190 --> 00:33:23.630
treatment for insomnia--

00:33:23.630 --> 00:33:25.690
so tackling the
negative thoughts

00:33:25.690 --> 00:33:27.920
and negative behaviors.

00:33:27.920 --> 00:33:29.890
There is a little bit
of a problem with CBT

00:33:29.890 --> 00:33:33.070
for insomnia, in that very few
people are actually trained

00:33:33.070 --> 00:33:35.230
to deliver it at the moment.

00:33:35.230 --> 00:33:37.240
If you can get it
on the NHS, it tends

00:33:37.240 --> 00:33:39.700
to be a very long waiting list.

00:33:39.700 --> 00:33:42.790
And it was this that
actually inspired the company

00:33:42.790 --> 00:33:44.800
that I work for--

00:33:44.800 --> 00:33:48.090
so a professor of sleep
medicine called Colin Espe,

00:33:48.090 --> 00:33:50.200
had been a clinical
psychologist for 30 years,

00:33:50.200 --> 00:33:53.488
seeing patients, helping
them with CBT for insomnia,

00:33:53.488 --> 00:33:55.030
and knowing that he
couldn't possibly

00:33:55.030 --> 00:33:57.850
help all the people
that needed help.

00:33:57.850 --> 00:34:00.910
So he actually worked with
a former insomnia patient

00:34:00.910 --> 00:34:05.890
called Peter Haynes to create an
online, digital version of CBT

00:34:05.890 --> 00:34:07.160
for insomnia.

00:34:07.160 --> 00:34:09.969
So essentially, it automates
all of the functions

00:34:09.969 --> 00:34:12.310
that the therapist would
go through with you,

00:34:12.310 --> 00:34:16.639
and teaches you the tools and
techniques to sleep better.

00:34:16.639 --> 00:34:19.300
So if you find your
way to Sleepio,

00:34:19.300 --> 00:34:22.120
you'll be able to do a very
quick online sleep test.

00:34:22.120 --> 00:34:24.790
This takes less than
two minutes to fill in.

00:34:24.790 --> 00:34:28.750
And it gives you a sleep
score, between naught and 10.

00:34:28.750 --> 00:34:31.300
If you have 10 out of
10, congratulations.

00:34:31.300 --> 00:34:34.750
If you do not, hopefully there's
more we can do to help you.

00:34:34.750 --> 00:34:37.570
So you can sign up for a few
sort of evidence-based sleep

00:34:37.570 --> 00:34:39.310
guides that you get by email.

00:34:39.310 --> 00:34:42.010
But the main thrust
of the program

00:34:42.010 --> 00:34:46.090
is actually a weekly session
with The Prof, your animated

00:34:46.090 --> 00:34:47.590
sleep expert.

00:34:47.590 --> 00:34:49.610
THE PROF: Hello there, Sophie.

00:34:49.610 --> 00:34:50.900
I am The Prof.

00:34:50.900 --> 00:34:55.409
And I'm here to do everything
I can to help you sleep better.

00:34:55.409 --> 00:34:57.690
Now, you may be thinking,
why should I trust

00:34:57.690 --> 00:34:59.910
you to tell me what to do?

00:34:59.910 --> 00:35:02.310
Well, everything we
do here at Sleepio

00:35:02.310 --> 00:35:05.122
is rooted firmly in
scientific evidence.

00:35:05.122 --> 00:35:07.080
SOPHIE BOSTOCK: So you
meet The Prof each week,

00:35:07.080 --> 00:35:08.970
and he teaches you
tools and techniques.

00:35:08.970 --> 00:35:11.930
And you use a sleep diary
to track your progress.

00:35:11.930 --> 00:35:13.650
And the nice thing
about being mobile

00:35:13.650 --> 00:35:16.977
is that obviously at any
time of day or night,

00:35:16.977 --> 00:35:18.810
you can be helped to
know what you should be

00:35:18.810 --> 00:35:22.020
doing to optimize your sleep.

00:35:22.020 --> 00:35:24.150
And The Prof mentioned evidence.

00:35:24.150 --> 00:35:27.000
Now, I just wanted to make
you aware of one study

00:35:27.000 --> 00:35:28.800
that you may or may
not be aware of.

00:35:28.800 --> 00:35:32.400
This is a few years
ago, back in 2014.

00:35:32.400 --> 00:35:34.810
We started speaking to
Google about Sleepio.

00:35:34.810 --> 00:35:36.780
And they said,
well, you have got

00:35:36.780 --> 00:35:38.912
a randomized
placebo-controlled trial.

00:35:38.912 --> 00:35:39.870
And that's interesting.

00:35:39.870 --> 00:35:42.470
But will it work for Google?

00:35:42.470 --> 00:35:44.190
Because we are different.

00:35:44.190 --> 00:35:49.800
So we did-- we did another
trial with 270 Googlers.

00:35:49.800 --> 00:35:51.610
We randomized them
into two groups,

00:35:51.610 --> 00:35:54.320
either using Sleepio
or just carrying on

00:35:54.320 --> 00:35:56.070
with whatever they
were doing at the time,

00:35:56.070 --> 00:35:57.780
followed them up
after eight weeks.

00:35:57.780 --> 00:36:01.590
And then the group who used
Sleepio were able to continue

00:36:01.590 --> 00:36:03.000
to use it they wanted to.

00:36:03.000 --> 00:36:05.090
And the second group got access.

00:36:05.090 --> 00:36:07.920
And we measured things like
sleep quality and well-being.

00:36:07.920 --> 00:36:10.410
I'm just going to show
you one piece of data,

00:36:10.410 --> 00:36:12.390
which is on well-being.

00:36:12.390 --> 00:36:15.360
So here, you can see group
one, significant uplift

00:36:15.360 --> 00:36:16.020
in well-being.

00:36:16.020 --> 00:36:17.850
And this was things
like, I'm satisfied

00:36:17.850 --> 00:36:19.440
with my overall well-being.

00:36:19.440 --> 00:36:23.580
I'm able to detach from
work during non-work hours.

00:36:23.580 --> 00:36:26.640
I'm able to cope effectively
with work-related stress.

00:36:26.640 --> 00:36:29.160
And I feel that my
workload is manageable.

00:36:32.140 --> 00:36:34.460
The improvements were
maintained three months later,

00:36:34.460 --> 00:36:37.040
and the second group saw
very similar improvements

00:36:37.040 --> 00:36:37.640
to the first.

00:36:37.640 --> 00:36:39.290
And this just mirrors
what we've now

00:36:39.290 --> 00:36:43.220
seen in eight randomized control
trials in over 6,000 people.

00:36:43.220 --> 00:36:46.860
CBT for insomnia works.

00:36:46.860 --> 00:36:49.580
And if you want to read more,
there's a fascinating paper

00:36:49.580 --> 00:36:52.310
that you can find.

00:36:52.310 --> 00:36:55.130
Since then, actually,
an awful lot of Googlers

00:36:55.130 --> 00:36:56.420
have been using the program.

00:36:56.420 --> 00:36:58.700
Over 550,000 have met The Prof.

00:36:58.700 --> 00:37:03.500
And on average, they're getting
2 and 1/2 extra hours of sleep

00:37:03.500 --> 00:37:04.520
each week.

00:37:04.520 --> 00:37:07.610
And they're reporting less
stress and less anxiety.

00:37:07.610 --> 00:37:10.220
So you could try it.

00:37:10.220 --> 00:37:14.010
I don't know, it
might be helpful.

00:37:14.010 --> 00:37:17.730
So just to sum up, I
haven't written a book.

00:37:17.730 --> 00:37:19.830
I tried to come up with
some memorable acronym.

00:37:19.830 --> 00:37:21.720
And I'm not sure
that I've succeeded.

00:37:21.720 --> 00:37:25.770
But I was thinking harness
the power of sleep.

00:37:25.770 --> 00:37:30.080
So P is for planning ahead,
prioritizing that seven hours.

00:37:30.080 --> 00:37:34.050
O is for getting outdoors
as much as possible.

00:37:34.050 --> 00:37:37.210
W is protecting that
wind down routine.

00:37:37.210 --> 00:37:39.570
Whether you have 30
minutes or 60 minutes,

00:37:39.570 --> 00:37:44.160
make that time work for
you in unwinding for sleep.

00:37:44.160 --> 00:37:45.690
E is for energizing.

00:37:45.690 --> 00:37:47.890
You still want to energize
your body during the day.

00:37:47.890 --> 00:37:50.280
But do it as
naturally as you can.

00:37:50.280 --> 00:37:52.260
And think about
limiting your caffeine,

00:37:52.260 --> 00:37:56.080
switching out caffeine for
decaf where it makes sense.

00:37:56.080 --> 00:37:57.600
And finally, R--

00:37:57.600 --> 00:37:59.280
I've said this a
lot of times today--

00:37:59.280 --> 00:38:01.320
routine, routine, routine.

00:38:01.320 --> 00:38:03.570
That's really going to
help your body clock.

00:38:03.570 --> 00:38:07.230
And set reminders on your
phone, remind other people

00:38:07.230 --> 00:38:09.540
in your family that actually
you're going to try this

00:38:09.540 --> 00:38:13.750
and commit to it because it
will be better for all of you.

00:38:13.750 --> 00:38:16.585
That's it.

00:38:16.585 --> 00:38:20.360
[APPLAUSE]

00:38:20.360 --> 00:38:23.990
AUDIENCE: Hi, thanks
for the speech first.

00:38:23.990 --> 00:38:28.670
And I have a question
regarding sleeping with light,

00:38:28.670 --> 00:38:31.490
natural light, versus
sleeping in darkness.

00:38:31.490 --> 00:38:34.760
Because I personally have
a problem with light.

00:38:34.760 --> 00:38:39.920
So I wake up at 6:00 if the
natural light is there at 6:00,

00:38:39.920 --> 00:38:41.860
or the same with every time.

00:38:41.860 --> 00:38:43.550
So what is the suggestion?

00:38:43.550 --> 00:38:46.892
Or is there kind of
a rule or something?

00:38:46.892 --> 00:38:48.350
SOPHIE BOSTOCK: So
are you thinking

00:38:48.350 --> 00:38:50.420
when it gets light
in the mornings,

00:38:50.420 --> 00:38:51.620
it's disturbing your sleep?

00:38:51.620 --> 00:38:53.180
You don't want to
get up at 6:00 ?

00:38:53.180 --> 00:38:54.440
AUDIENCE: Yeah, yeah.

00:38:54.440 --> 00:38:58.350
Like for example, if my
routine is seven to eight hours

00:38:58.350 --> 00:39:01.520
and it starts at
midnight or at 11:00,

00:39:01.520 --> 00:39:03.725
it doesn't work if
the sun rises at 5:00.

00:39:03.725 --> 00:39:04.850
SOPHIE BOSTOCK: Absolutely.

00:39:04.850 --> 00:39:06.470
And if you didn't
have to go to work,

00:39:06.470 --> 00:39:08.420
and you were able to live on
the savannah quite happily,

00:39:08.420 --> 00:39:09.170
you wouldn't mind.

00:39:09.170 --> 00:39:11.032
And you would rise
naturally with dawn.

00:39:11.032 --> 00:39:11.990
And that would be fine.

00:39:11.990 --> 00:39:14.450
Your body clock would
adjust through the year.

00:39:14.450 --> 00:39:16.340
But yes, we all have
other commitments.

00:39:16.340 --> 00:39:20.490
So if you actually want to
sleep for longer, very easy.

00:39:20.490 --> 00:39:23.250
Make sure that you
have blackout blinds.

00:39:23.250 --> 00:39:25.610
Really try and
interfere, actually,

00:39:25.610 --> 00:39:28.680
with that morning sunshine
if that's not what you want.

00:39:28.680 --> 00:39:31.670
Sometimes you will say yes,
but my partner wants the sun.

00:39:31.670 --> 00:39:33.080
What do I do?

00:39:33.080 --> 00:39:34.940
There's a very
simple intervention

00:39:34.940 --> 00:39:36.670
called a sleep mask--

00:39:36.670 --> 00:39:38.540
a soft-- I know.

00:39:38.540 --> 00:39:41.540
It's very, very cheap,
very, very simple.

00:39:41.540 --> 00:39:44.180
Often, if you wear one for
a night or two, you're-- oh,

00:39:44.180 --> 00:39:45.290
I don't know about this.

00:39:45.290 --> 00:39:47.748
But actually, most people who
stick to it for three or four

00:39:47.748 --> 00:39:50.420
nights, they're like
oh, actually this really

00:39:50.420 --> 00:39:51.238
makes a difference.

00:39:51.238 --> 00:39:53.280
And one of the advantages
of wearing a sleep mask

00:39:53.280 --> 00:39:55.220
is if you go traveling,
it's something

00:39:55.220 --> 00:39:57.150
you can take with you anywhere.

00:39:57.150 --> 00:39:59.810
And if you are developing a
napping habit because actually,

00:39:59.810 --> 00:40:02.870
you are unable to get enough
sleep during the night,

00:40:02.870 --> 00:40:05.390
having a sleep mask
sort of with you,

00:40:05.390 --> 00:40:07.730
it kind of creates a
little cocoon effect

00:40:07.730 --> 00:40:09.690
that can be quite helpful.

00:40:09.690 --> 00:40:13.452
So yeah, if light is disturbing
you, block out the light.

00:40:13.452 --> 00:40:14.660
AUDIENCE: Yeah, thanks a lot.

00:40:14.660 --> 00:40:17.630
So can you speak a bit
about using some medication,

00:40:17.630 --> 00:40:19.430
say melatonin?

00:40:19.430 --> 00:40:21.110
Because I know, for
instance, in the US

00:40:21.110 --> 00:40:23.860
you can buy it in any pharmacy.

00:40:23.860 --> 00:40:27.080
But here you can really--
you need to get prescription.

00:40:27.080 --> 00:40:29.365
So is there a kind of
consensus about it?

00:40:29.365 --> 00:40:31.490
SOPHIE BOSTOCK: Yeah, so
that's an interesting one.

00:40:31.490 --> 00:40:34.010
melatonin is a natural
hormone, as we saw.

00:40:34.010 --> 00:40:37.280
It definitely signals to the
body that it's time for sleep.

00:40:37.280 --> 00:40:40.770
But what it doesn't do is
override your stress response.

00:40:40.770 --> 00:40:43.280
So it's not a very
powerful hormone

00:40:43.280 --> 00:40:45.120
in terms of tackling insomnia.

00:40:45.120 --> 00:40:48.220
So the effects of using
melatonin on insomnia

00:40:48.220 --> 00:40:49.490
are pretty much null.

00:40:49.490 --> 00:40:50.990
They're not strong.

00:40:50.990 --> 00:40:52.730
What melatonin can
be very helpful

00:40:52.730 --> 00:40:56.180
for is if your body clock is out
of sync with the environment.

00:40:56.180 --> 00:40:58.850
Because it's really something
that influences your body clock

00:40:58.850 --> 00:41:00.810
more than anything.

00:41:00.810 --> 00:41:04.370
So if you're jet-lagged,
actually very, very helpful

00:41:04.370 --> 00:41:07.260
for adjusting over time.

00:41:07.260 --> 00:41:09.740
There are some questions
about melatonin,

00:41:09.740 --> 00:41:11.670
just like most other
natural hormones.

00:41:11.670 --> 00:41:15.140
If you're taking it, does it
mean that your body is actually

00:41:15.140 --> 00:41:17.260
going to produce less?

00:41:17.260 --> 00:41:20.930
And I think that's
a potential concern.

00:41:20.930 --> 00:41:22.880
But I'm not sure
that the research

00:41:22.880 --> 00:41:26.540
is being done long term to work
out whether actually taking

00:41:26.540 --> 00:41:28.670
artificial melatonin
may in some way

00:41:28.670 --> 00:41:30.960
disrupt your natural patterns.

00:41:30.960 --> 00:41:35.000
So with most of these things,
I wouldn't take something

00:41:35.000 --> 00:41:37.210
artificial for a long time.

00:41:37.210 --> 00:41:39.500
It'd be much better to
sort your habits out.

00:41:39.500 --> 00:41:42.440
But if you have a
short term stress,

00:41:42.440 --> 00:41:46.500
like lots of travel and jet-lag,
I think very, very helpful,

00:41:46.500 --> 00:41:48.260
perhaps.

00:41:48.260 --> 00:41:50.150
AUDIENCE: Hi, I'm
just wondering--

00:41:50.150 --> 00:41:51.710
thank you for the talk.

00:41:51.710 --> 00:41:54.350
I'm just wondering what's your
view on the quantification

00:41:54.350 --> 00:41:57.900
and measurement of other sleep
stats all the watches we have,

00:41:57.900 --> 00:41:58.700
et cetera.

00:41:58.700 --> 00:42:01.370
And second question is, any
tips for taking power naps?

00:42:01.370 --> 00:42:04.190
Because sometimes it's very
difficult for me to fall asleep

00:42:04.190 --> 00:42:05.450
after I'm awake.

00:42:05.450 --> 00:42:06.700
SOPHIE BOSTOCK: Yes.

00:42:06.700 --> 00:42:10.140
OK, so first question
about measurement.

00:42:10.140 --> 00:42:14.810
So the only way to
know exactly what's

00:42:14.810 --> 00:42:17.510
going on during the brain--

00:42:17.510 --> 00:42:20.030
in the brain during
sleep, is to measure

00:42:20.030 --> 00:42:23.390
the electrical impulses-- so
an electroencephalogram, which

00:42:23.390 --> 00:42:26.220
will actually tell you the
different stages of sleep.

00:42:26.220 --> 00:42:28.130
And I didn't show it
in the presentation.

00:42:28.130 --> 00:42:29.570
We tend to have
around about sort

00:42:29.570 --> 00:42:32.990
of three main stages of
sleep, and then a REM,

00:42:32.990 --> 00:42:35.030
rapid eye movement, sleep.

00:42:35.030 --> 00:42:39.620
So stage one, very light sleep,
can very easily get woken up.

00:42:39.620 --> 00:42:43.070
Few people dipping
into stage one now.

00:42:43.070 --> 00:42:45.170
And then stage two is
a kind of true sleep

00:42:45.170 --> 00:42:47.150
where your body temperature
starts to go down,

00:42:47.150 --> 00:42:48.680
blood pressure
starts to go down.

00:42:48.680 --> 00:42:51.555
But stage three is where it's
very, very hard to wake you up

00:42:51.555 --> 00:42:53.510
and you've got growth
hormone being produced.

00:42:53.510 --> 00:42:56.330
And then you come back through
these cycles of REM sleep,

00:42:56.330 --> 00:42:58.880
dream sleep, which is
so important for memory

00:42:58.880 --> 00:43:01.760
consolidation and
emotional balance.

00:43:01.760 --> 00:43:06.710
So basically, we sleep in
these five or six sleep cycles.

00:43:06.710 --> 00:43:10.190
Most of the trackers
that you wear,

00:43:10.190 --> 00:43:12.590
they used to just
rely on movement.

00:43:12.590 --> 00:43:14.910
And it so happens
that during REM sleep,

00:43:14.910 --> 00:43:17.150
your body is actually paralyzed.

00:43:17.150 --> 00:43:19.265
So-- we think--

00:43:19.265 --> 00:43:21.440
so that you can't
act out your dreams.

00:43:21.440 --> 00:43:24.100
So they use an algorithm
based on your movement

00:43:24.100 --> 00:43:27.200
to kind of predict ah, OK, that
was a period of not moving.

00:43:27.200 --> 00:43:30.290
That must be the end
of the sleep cycle.

00:43:30.290 --> 00:43:32.870
That's not a very good way
of estimating whether or not

00:43:32.870 --> 00:43:34.400
somebody is awake or asleep.

00:43:34.400 --> 00:43:38.270
Because we can all lie very
still and not be sleep.

00:43:38.270 --> 00:43:40.880
The newer new age
kind of trackers,

00:43:40.880 --> 00:43:44.780
which use heart rate
variability or pulse rate, those

00:43:44.780 --> 00:43:45.840
seem to be better.

00:43:45.840 --> 00:43:48.980
But there's been relatively
little published validation

00:43:48.980 --> 00:43:52.272
to show that they are as
good as a polysonogram, where

00:43:52.272 --> 00:43:54.870
you go into the lab and have
lots of things measured.

00:43:54.870 --> 00:43:57.120
But I did see a
small study recently,

00:43:57.120 --> 00:43:59.900
which was using one of the
Fitbit kind of new age--

00:43:59.900 --> 00:44:02.690
which actually showed pretty
good sort of specificity

00:44:02.690 --> 00:44:04.783
and sensitivity to sleep.

00:44:04.783 --> 00:44:06.200
What you probably
don't want to do

00:44:06.200 --> 00:44:08.840
is compare your sleep
to somebody else's sleep

00:44:08.840 --> 00:44:10.340
using those trackers.

00:44:10.340 --> 00:44:14.700
I think it's OK to use
it as a guide for you.

00:44:14.700 --> 00:44:17.570
But then you've got to
ask, why am I using it?

00:44:17.570 --> 00:44:19.820
The best measure
of whether or not

00:44:19.820 --> 00:44:22.690
you are getting
good quality sleep

00:44:22.690 --> 00:44:25.730
is how you feel during the day.

00:44:25.730 --> 00:44:30.150
And your tracker can't
really help you with that.

00:44:30.150 --> 00:44:31.760
The second question
was about naps.

00:44:31.760 --> 00:44:33.530
Any top tips for naps?

00:44:33.530 --> 00:44:37.580
So a lot of us will have
this very strong body clock.

00:44:37.580 --> 00:44:41.630
And actually, we won't have a
very strong lull after lunch.

00:44:41.630 --> 00:44:44.030
And it's quite
hard for us to nap.

00:44:44.030 --> 00:44:46.250
If you don't feel
sleepy, don't nap.

00:44:46.250 --> 00:44:49.290
That's one thing.

00:44:49.290 --> 00:44:53.690
It is something to
adapt as a habit.

00:44:53.690 --> 00:44:55.370
Your body clock learns.

00:44:55.370 --> 00:44:58.250
So if you keep
trying and protecting

00:44:58.250 --> 00:45:02.340
your 20 minutes after lunch
when you think you are probably

00:45:02.340 --> 00:45:06.050
in need of a re-boost, even if
you're just sitting quietly,

00:45:06.050 --> 00:45:08.520
maybe you're meditating,
it's probably still going

00:45:08.520 --> 00:45:10.268
to have a restorative effect.

00:45:10.268 --> 00:45:11.810
Because you'll
probably still be able

00:45:11.810 --> 00:45:14.570
to up your parasympathetic
nervous system, your rest,

00:45:14.570 --> 00:45:18.290
your digest, and start to
feel physically refreshed even

00:45:18.290 --> 00:45:21.260
if you haven't done all of
the memory kind of recharging

00:45:21.260 --> 00:45:21.960
in the brain.

00:45:21.960 --> 00:45:24.800
So I think it's still
worth having a break

00:45:24.800 --> 00:45:27.600
even if it's not a nap.

00:45:27.600 --> 00:45:30.120
AUDIENCE: OK, I have
a quick question.

00:45:30.120 --> 00:45:32.325
So first of all, thank
you for coming to Google.

00:45:32.325 --> 00:45:33.200
This is really great.

00:45:33.200 --> 00:45:34.158
I've really enjoyed it.

00:45:34.158 --> 00:45:35.510
So thank you for that.

00:45:35.510 --> 00:45:37.352
Quick question
about winding down.

00:45:37.352 --> 00:45:38.810
So for instance,
I have the problem

00:45:38.810 --> 00:45:40.170
of waking up really early.

00:45:40.170 --> 00:45:41.660
So I try to go to bed early.

00:45:41.660 --> 00:45:44.420
But because I'm always on--
like very switched on--

00:45:44.420 --> 00:45:46.863
in the morning I'll wake
up like, 5:00, right?

00:45:46.863 --> 00:45:49.280
And then I can't get back to
sleep until, let's say 6:30--

00:45:49.280 --> 00:45:51.350
a reasonable time to get up.

00:45:51.350 --> 00:45:54.503
So I'm wondering any tactics
for continuing to sleep, right?

00:45:54.503 --> 00:45:56.420
If you've gotten, let's
say, six hours but you

00:45:56.420 --> 00:45:58.520
wake up because
you're kind of wired,

00:45:58.520 --> 00:46:01.370
how do you actually get
yourself, for another hour,

00:46:01.370 --> 00:46:02.055
into sleep mode?

00:46:02.055 --> 00:46:04.430
SOPHIE BOSTOCK: I'm sure
there's a lot of people probably

00:46:04.430 --> 00:46:06.805
in the room who are interested
in the answer to that one.

00:46:06.805 --> 00:46:09.717
And what interested me
there is that you've said,

00:46:09.717 --> 00:46:11.550
you know, I wake up so
early in the morning,

00:46:11.550 --> 00:46:14.310
so I try and go to
bed earlier at night.

00:46:14.310 --> 00:46:16.710
And that's kind of your mistake.

00:46:16.710 --> 00:46:18.620
You're waking up,
exactly as you say,

00:46:18.620 --> 00:46:20.630
because you're a
bit sort of wired.

00:46:20.630 --> 00:46:23.940
You are kind of in this
vigilant sort of state.

00:46:23.940 --> 00:46:27.170
So there's a lot in terms of
the relaxation techniques,

00:46:27.170 --> 00:46:31.310
and learning to detach from all
this exciting stuff going on

00:46:31.310 --> 00:46:32.670
in life.

00:46:32.670 --> 00:46:36.650
But there's also something in
increasing your sleep pressure.

00:46:36.650 --> 00:46:38.810
So one of the things
that we do in CBT

00:46:38.810 --> 00:46:41.870
is to use a technique called
sleep restriction, which

00:46:41.870 --> 00:46:44.090
sounds very counter-intuitive.

00:46:44.090 --> 00:46:47.900
But it actually involves
pushing your bed time back.

00:46:47.900 --> 00:46:50.770
So if you normally
go to bed at 10, say,

00:46:50.770 --> 00:46:53.270
but you're waking up at 5:00
in the morning despite the fact

00:46:53.270 --> 00:46:57.110
that you wanted to sleep
until 7, maybe in that time

00:46:57.110 --> 00:46:59.270
you're only getting
six hours sleep.

00:46:59.270 --> 00:47:02.510
So by tracking your sleep over
a couple of weeks using a sleep

00:47:02.510 --> 00:47:07.610
diary, the advice would be,
OK, try and go to bed at 1:00

00:47:07.610 --> 00:47:09.470
in the morning.

00:47:09.470 --> 00:47:11.400
Set your alarm
for 7:00, whenever

00:47:11.400 --> 00:47:13.550
your desired wake-up time is.

00:47:13.550 --> 00:47:15.920
You're going to get
incredibly tired

00:47:15.920 --> 00:47:18.320
trying to keep yourself awake.

00:47:18.320 --> 00:47:21.290
But you will build up a
stronger sleep pressure.

00:47:21.290 --> 00:47:23.718
And you'll start to
sleep through the night.

00:47:23.718 --> 00:47:25.760
And then as you start to
sleep through the night,

00:47:25.760 --> 00:47:27.650
you can increase
your sleep window.

00:47:27.650 --> 00:47:29.550
The other way to do
it is a slightly sort

00:47:29.550 --> 00:47:30.530
of softer approach.

00:47:30.530 --> 00:47:33.230
Rather than going straight
in for 1:00 in the morning,

00:47:33.230 --> 00:47:35.510
you could just
compress a little bit.

00:47:35.510 --> 00:47:39.230
And keep compressing if it's
not sort of working for you.

00:47:39.230 --> 00:47:41.450
But that sleep
restriction idea gets

00:47:41.450 --> 00:47:44.430
introduced in week three
of the Sleepio program.

00:47:44.430 --> 00:47:49.040
It's probably the single most
powerful technique in CBT

00:47:49.040 --> 00:47:52.640
for helping people reset that
sort of wakefulness early

00:47:52.640 --> 00:47:54.060
in the morning issue.

00:47:54.060 --> 00:47:55.446
So definitely give that a go.

00:47:55.446 --> 00:47:56.773
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:47:56.773 --> 00:47:58.190
AUDIENCE: I'll
sneak in a question

00:47:58.190 --> 00:48:01.740
from someone who is not in the
room-- we have a Dory today.

00:48:01.740 --> 00:48:05.350
So the question is, do alarms
based on the sleep cycle,

00:48:05.350 --> 00:48:07.625
deep versus light, work?

00:48:07.625 --> 00:48:10.250
SOPHIE BOSTOCK: So I think that
relates to the sort of tracking

00:48:10.250 --> 00:48:11.450
question.

00:48:11.450 --> 00:48:15.770
Unless your brain
is cued into a lab,

00:48:15.770 --> 00:48:19.910
it's very difficult to know
what stage of sleep you're in.

00:48:19.910 --> 00:48:22.890
I haven't seen a lot
of convincing evidence,

00:48:22.890 --> 00:48:25.430
but that's probably because
a lot hasn't been published.

00:48:25.430 --> 00:48:28.510
If it works for
you, I say use it.

00:48:28.510 --> 00:48:31.850
And a lot of this kind of sleep
science, it's very individual.

00:48:31.850 --> 00:48:34.710
If there's something
you find reassuring--

00:48:34.710 --> 00:48:36.530
so for example, chamomile tea.

00:48:36.530 --> 00:48:38.180
Some people swear by it.

00:48:38.180 --> 00:48:40.610
The actual evidence
from scientific trials

00:48:40.610 --> 00:48:42.200
is pretty equivocal--

00:48:42.200 --> 00:48:44.700
probably doesn't
really do very much.

00:48:44.700 --> 00:48:47.420
But there's a very
strong placebo effect.

00:48:47.420 --> 00:48:50.750
Anything that makes you feel
like you are sleeping well

00:48:50.750 --> 00:48:53.400
is probably a good idea
for you, personally.

00:48:53.400 --> 00:48:57.225
Even if the science is
a bit kind of shaky.

00:48:57.225 --> 00:48:59.510
AUDIENCE: Hi, what
do you recommend

00:48:59.510 --> 00:49:02.020
for winding down at night?

00:49:02.020 --> 00:49:04.730
The other question is if I
want to go to bed at 11:00,

00:49:04.730 --> 00:49:07.640
is it a bad idea to go to the
gym like between 9:00 and 10:00

00:49:07.640 --> 00:49:08.450
in the evening?

00:49:08.450 --> 00:49:12.710
SOPHIE BOSTOCK: OK, I'll take
off at the gym one first.

00:49:12.710 --> 00:49:14.780
It used to be thought--
the advice used to be

00:49:14.780 --> 00:49:17.050
not to exercise late at night.

00:49:17.050 --> 00:49:19.490
And the reason being because
it increases your body

00:49:19.490 --> 00:49:20.180
temperature.

00:49:20.180 --> 00:49:22.070
It really gets the body going.

00:49:22.070 --> 00:49:24.350
And there was some
evidence that absolutely,

00:49:24.350 --> 00:49:26.940
if your body is too
hot, you cannot sleep.

00:49:26.940 --> 00:49:30.590
So one of the things I didn't
mention is to cool your room.

00:49:30.590 --> 00:49:34.970
So an ideal room temperature
is 18 degrees, supposedly,

00:49:34.970 --> 00:49:37.640
with air circulating
if possible.

00:49:37.640 --> 00:49:40.333
So subsequent to
that, the advice

00:49:40.333 --> 00:49:41.750
is actually some
people are really

00:49:41.750 --> 00:49:45.440
quite effective at cooling down,
like mentally and physically,

00:49:45.440 --> 00:49:46.790
after they've been to the gym.

00:49:46.790 --> 00:49:50.060
So I would have thought that if
you're doing something highly

00:49:50.060 --> 00:49:53.270
aerobic, it's going to take
you at least an hour if not 90

00:49:53.270 --> 00:49:56.180
minutes to properly
calm down after that.

00:49:56.180 --> 00:49:59.210
So you want to allow
enough time for that.

00:49:59.210 --> 00:50:02.210
But this is about being
a scientist of yourself

00:50:02.210 --> 00:50:03.950
and kind of experimenting.

00:50:03.950 --> 00:50:06.290
You know, if you push that
exercise time a little bit

00:50:06.290 --> 00:50:08.430
forward, does it make you
sleep better, and so on?

00:50:08.430 --> 00:50:10.880
Because it will be different
for different people.

00:50:10.880 --> 00:50:14.750
In terms of the
wind down routine,

00:50:14.750 --> 00:50:17.270
you can ask parents what
they do for their kids,

00:50:17.270 --> 00:50:20.540
and everyone's probably got
a slightly different pattern.

00:50:20.540 --> 00:50:21.843
But they get into a pattern.

00:50:21.843 --> 00:50:23.010
And that's what's important.

00:50:23.010 --> 00:50:24.520
That's what gets reassuring.

00:50:24.520 --> 00:50:26.660
It doesn't matter if you
have a bath or a shower,

00:50:26.660 --> 00:50:28.490
or you read, or you meditate.

00:50:28.490 --> 00:50:30.710
I know that Google's got
some really good resources.

00:50:30.710 --> 00:50:31.502
I know you've got--

00:50:31.502 --> 00:50:33.120
Headspace is
available if you want

00:50:33.120 --> 00:50:36.200
to learn mindfulness meditation.

00:50:36.200 --> 00:50:40.510
Just reading a book
that is not energizing,

00:50:40.510 --> 00:50:43.790
sort of alerting,
light-filled experience,

00:50:43.790 --> 00:50:46.670
watching TV so long as you are
far enough away that you're not

00:50:46.670 --> 00:50:49.130
getting overstimulated
by the content.

00:50:49.130 --> 00:50:51.350
I definitely wouldn't do
that right before bed,

00:50:51.350 --> 00:50:53.990
but as part of an hour-long
wind down routine, that

00:50:53.990 --> 00:50:54.990
might be fine.

00:50:54.990 --> 00:50:57.920
It's just about psychological
and physical kind

00:50:57.920 --> 00:51:01.650
of detachment from the day.

00:51:01.650 --> 00:51:04.360
AUDIENCE: Yes, I wanted to
ask you about noise in the

00:51:04.360 --> 00:51:06.530
because we talked about
light in the morning.

00:51:06.530 --> 00:51:08.850
Like earplugs-- I
mean, maybe it's not

00:51:08.850 --> 00:51:10.620
good to use them every night.

00:51:10.620 --> 00:51:13.530
I'm wondering about other ways--
can you train yourself to not

00:51:13.530 --> 00:51:15.660
be sensitive to noise,
or noise generators,

00:51:15.660 --> 00:51:16.710
or what do you suggest?

00:51:16.710 --> 00:51:18.670
SOPHIE BOSTOCK: Good question.

00:51:18.670 --> 00:51:21.630
Some people definitely
find white noise machines

00:51:21.630 --> 00:51:22.950
very useful.

00:51:22.950 --> 00:51:26.050
This doesn't have to be
something very expensive.

00:51:26.050 --> 00:51:27.930
It could be a fan.

00:51:27.930 --> 00:51:29.328
I think Wayne
Rooney swore by it.

00:51:29.328 --> 00:51:31.120
He said he couldn't
sleep without the noise

00:51:31.120 --> 00:51:33.037
of the washing machine
or something like that.

00:51:33.037 --> 00:51:35.670
There are certain noises
which block out other sounds.

00:51:35.670 --> 00:51:39.030
So a fan and similiar
can be quite good.

00:51:39.030 --> 00:51:42.180
An artificial noise
machine, absolutely fine.

00:51:42.180 --> 00:51:45.300
There isn't any evidence that
so long as it's not too loud,

00:51:45.300 --> 00:51:47.610
that that's going to
disrupt your sleep.

00:51:47.610 --> 00:51:49.560
I also don't think
there are any issues

00:51:49.560 --> 00:51:53.400
with using earplugs
long term, provided

00:51:53.400 --> 00:51:55.830
that they're good quality.

00:51:55.830 --> 00:51:59.470
But I wouldn't worry about
using earplugs as a negative.

00:51:59.470 --> 00:52:02.670
I think, actually
it's quite sensible.

00:52:02.670 --> 00:52:05.350
SPEAKER: Time for
one more question.

00:52:05.350 --> 00:52:07.560
AUDIENCE: Oh wow, thank you.

00:52:07.560 --> 00:52:08.610
We could go on.

00:52:08.610 --> 00:52:11.760
So during the week, I
rarely get enough sleep.

00:52:11.760 --> 00:52:14.280
And then on the weekend,
I do sleep longer.

00:52:14.280 --> 00:52:15.660
Is that sufficient?

00:52:15.660 --> 00:52:18.840
I mean, you talked about
the brain self-repairing.

00:52:18.840 --> 00:52:21.330
SOPHIE BOSTOCK: Yeah,
so here's the thing.

00:52:21.330 --> 00:52:23.100
It's better to sleep
than not to sleep.

00:52:23.100 --> 00:52:25.200
So great that you're making
an effort to catch up

00:52:25.200 --> 00:52:26.290
on sleep at the weekend.

00:52:26.290 --> 00:52:28.530
But for every night
of short sleep,

00:52:28.530 --> 00:52:29.973
you are feeling those effects.

00:52:29.973 --> 00:52:32.640
On your Tuesday, your Wednesday,
your Thursday, and your Friday,

00:52:32.640 --> 00:52:34.140
you are building
up that sleep debt.

00:52:34.140 --> 00:52:36.210
So by Friday afternoon,
I hope you're not

00:52:36.210 --> 00:52:37.800
operating heavy machinery.

00:52:37.800 --> 00:52:40.590
But it's not ideal.

00:52:40.590 --> 00:52:43.620
If you can find even just
an extra half an hour

00:52:43.620 --> 00:52:45.390
during the week, what
you'll actually find

00:52:45.390 --> 00:52:47.358
is that you have more weekend.

00:52:47.358 --> 00:52:48.900
You've got more of
a life because you

00:52:48.900 --> 00:52:51.480
don't have to worry about
catching up on your sleep.

00:52:51.480 --> 00:52:53.520
The other thing is that
come Monday morning,

00:52:53.520 --> 00:52:55.800
you're effectively
giving yourself jet-lag

00:52:55.800 --> 00:52:59.550
if you have a different pattern
during the week to the weekend.

00:52:59.550 --> 00:53:02.670
And there is some research
evidence that come out

00:53:02.670 --> 00:53:04.650
suggesting that of
this sort of pattern--

00:53:04.650 --> 00:53:06.990
we do call it social jet-lag--

00:53:06.990 --> 00:53:10.770
could increase risks of high
blood pressure, of weight gain.

00:53:10.770 --> 00:53:15.280
It's putting more pressure on
your body than is necessary.
