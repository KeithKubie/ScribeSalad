DOREEN MASHU: OK.

00:00:05.750 --> 00:00:07.070
My name Doreen.

00:00:07.070 --> 00:00:11.330
I just graduated as
a Sloan Fellow 2018.

00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:15.200
I came here from Zimbabwe,
and I did an independent study

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:16.095
with Anjali Sastry.

00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:25.240
So I had 10 years
work experience

00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:28.720
in accounting and finance
before I came to Sloan.

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:31.270
And I had this passion
for agriculture

00:00:31.270 --> 00:00:35.740
that stemmed from growing
up in Zimbabwe with parents

00:00:35.740 --> 00:00:37.600
that were farmers.

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:42.860
So I had done quite a bit
of research personally

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:45.912
on agriculture everywhere
that I had worked.

00:00:45.912 --> 00:00:47.620
And even though I was
working in finance,

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:52.000
I tried to make sure that
I did some agriculture

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.150
work, whether it was mergers
and acquisitions or whatever.

00:00:55.150 --> 00:00:57.610
I tried to make sure that
I infused agriculture

00:00:57.610 --> 00:00:59.110
into my work.

00:00:59.110 --> 00:01:04.959
So when I got here, I wanted
to formalize this passion

00:01:04.959 --> 00:01:10.720
and do a bit more in-depth
analysis, in-depth research

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:13.240
on this sector and what
I wanted to contribute

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:15.230
to it after graduation.

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:17.980
So I did an independent
study titled

00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:21.280
Innovations Across the
Agriculture Value Chain--

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:23.260
An Opportunity for
Savvy Entrepreneurs,

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:27.010
because I want to be an
entrepreneur in this sector.

00:01:27.010 --> 00:01:29.410
So the independent
study involved

00:01:29.410 --> 00:01:36.190
researching the current value
chain, or the traditional value

00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:39.550
chain as it is, and
then interviewing

00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:43.210
different stakeholders to
figure out where opportunities

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:44.904
are for innovation.

00:01:44.904 --> 00:01:46.570
And that's what I
worked on with Anjali.

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:54.450
So I started out
with some questions

00:01:54.450 --> 00:02:00.900
that I wanted to answer, or some
hypotheses, and the main one

00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:04.560
was the fact that there
is a big opportunity

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:06.390
to do value addition.

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:11.000
And so to move farmers from
the traditional farming

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:17.250
and raw material production
to actual processing of items,

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:23.130
of consumer goods, whether it's
juice or personal care items.

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:27.150
Anything that can be produced
from excess agricultural

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:28.260
produce.

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:34.380
So my hypothesis was that
everybody on the table

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:39.210
would agree with the statement,
that that is the only way

00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:42.240
to move farmers or
rural communities

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:44.520
from poverty to prosperity.

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:49.080
And that's where most
of the investments

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:51.340
should be going forward.

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:53.640
So I started with that
question, and so when

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:56.370
I interviewed stakeholders,
I interviewed farmers.

00:02:56.370 --> 00:02:58.440
I interviewed business people.

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:02.220
I interviewed development
organizations.

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:08.460
And asked questions that
questioned or poked on that

00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:10.500
hypothesis, or supported it.

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:14.440
And the response was
actually what I expected,

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:19.030
which is it's true
that that is where

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:20.890
everybody thinks that
the investment should

00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:23.170
be focused on.

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:26.830
It's just a matter of changing
some existing mental models

00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:33.040
that keep both farmers and
investors in this sector stuck

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:36.160
in and doing things as
they've always been done.

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:42.840
I looked at all the things
that I was interested in,

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:44.880
things that I was
passionate about,

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:50.010
but that I wasn't necessarily
addressing through my MBA

00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:52.230
classes at Sloan.

00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:55.740
And so agriculture stood out.

00:03:55.740 --> 00:03:57.960
And then within
agriculture I looked

00:03:57.960 --> 00:04:03.390
at what was related
to my startup, which

00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:08.520
is what I'm hoping to work
on now that I've graduated.

00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:13.842
And so it was easy to
narrow down a topic,

00:04:13.842 --> 00:04:15.300
because I wanted
something that was

00:04:15.300 --> 00:04:18.410
aligned with my startup
and my interests.

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:29.730
Managing the work and myself
was probably the most difficult.

00:04:29.730 --> 00:04:32.520
I think, like I
said, because I had

00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:36.950
done some research on the
topic without really having

00:04:36.950 --> 00:04:42.870
any plans of using
it in any formal way,

00:04:42.870 --> 00:04:47.910
I underestimated the time it
would take to actually come up

00:04:47.910 --> 00:04:49.800
with something meaningful.

00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:53.400
And I like to talk--

00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:54.430
I'm a people person.

00:04:54.430 --> 00:04:56.340
So I enjoyed the
interviewing part,

00:04:56.340 --> 00:04:58.860
and I kept gathering information
and gathering information,

00:04:58.860 --> 00:05:02.940
and talking to people more than
the people I had on my list.

00:05:02.940 --> 00:05:06.600
But then when it came
to gathering the insight

00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:10.920
and writing, what I had
done and why I had done it

00:05:10.920 --> 00:05:15.120
and what the next steps
are, it was of difficult.

00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:17.490
And also I had a
full course load,

00:05:17.490 --> 00:05:21.600
because I spent all of my
IAP doing this research.

00:05:21.600 --> 00:05:25.650
And so I didn't take any
other classes or any units

00:05:25.650 --> 00:05:27.120
that I needed
towards graduation.

00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:30.540
So in the spring,
everything was due.

00:05:30.540 --> 00:05:33.960
The independent study, all
the courses, and all of that.

00:05:33.960 --> 00:05:38.550
So it was difficult, but
I worked with Anjali a lot

00:05:38.550 --> 00:05:44.480
in trying to figure out how
I needed to craft the paper.

00:05:44.480 --> 00:05:48.740
And so we did a few
iterations of that.

00:05:48.740 --> 00:05:50.880
She actually is very hands-on.

00:05:50.880 --> 00:05:53.840
So she'll take
positive notes write--

00:05:53.840 --> 00:05:55.799
this first section could
be this, do you agree?

00:05:55.799 --> 00:05:57.340
What are you trying
to get from that?

00:05:57.340 --> 00:05:59.000
So she pushed me
a bit and ask me

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:02.390
questions that helped me figure
out the structure of the paper.

00:06:02.390 --> 00:06:09.190
And also the time I would
spend on each section,

00:06:09.190 --> 00:06:12.430
and what was more important
and what was less important.

00:06:12.430 --> 00:06:15.700
And how I can show
that I actually

00:06:15.700 --> 00:06:18.190
did the work, because
doing the work

00:06:18.190 --> 00:06:22.820
and actually reporting the
work is quite different.

00:06:22.820 --> 00:06:25.570
But in the end, it worked,
definitely with Anjali's help,

00:06:25.570 --> 00:06:27.700
and working extra hours.

00:06:31.810 --> 00:06:34.590
So I think this experience
was interesting for me,

00:06:34.590 --> 00:06:38.290
because I ended up
using frameworks

00:06:38.290 --> 00:06:43.770
in the independent study that
I think are unique to Sloan.

00:06:43.770 --> 00:06:49.050
So for example, I used systems
thinking, which is obviously

00:06:49.050 --> 00:06:51.480
a big thing here at Sloan.

00:06:51.480 --> 00:06:55.020
And also things
around sustainability

00:06:55.020 --> 00:06:59.310
and sustainability-oriented
innovation, which MIT

00:06:59.310 --> 00:07:01.200
is a champion in.

00:07:01.200 --> 00:07:09.450
So I think that being in
this environment helped

00:07:09.450 --> 00:07:11.670
with the framework
I was going to use

00:07:11.670 --> 00:07:15.890
and the way I was
writing this paper.

00:07:15.890 --> 00:07:17.820
Entrepreneurship
is also big at MIT,

00:07:17.820 --> 00:07:19.560
so that's why I
even wanted to be

00:07:19.560 --> 00:07:22.740
an entrepreneur after a
10-year career in finance.

00:07:22.740 --> 00:07:25.470
So I think all of those
things went together

00:07:25.470 --> 00:07:30.240
to help me produce
this independent study.

00:07:30.240 --> 00:07:35.160
I do think, however, it's just--

00:07:35.160 --> 00:07:37.624
yes, for me it was MIT,
but for anyone else

00:07:37.624 --> 00:07:38.790
it could be anything, right?

00:07:38.790 --> 00:07:40.470
It's just a matter
of figuring out

00:07:40.470 --> 00:07:42.430
what you have in
your own ecosystem,

00:07:42.430 --> 00:07:44.611
and then using that
to your advantage.

00:07:48.150 --> 00:07:49.900
Also, in addition to
being a Sloan Fellow,

00:07:49.900 --> 00:07:52.150
I'm a Legatum fellow, which is--

00:07:52.150 --> 00:07:55.960
Legatum is a center here
at MIT for entrepreneurship

00:07:55.960 --> 00:07:58.520
and development.

00:07:58.520 --> 00:08:01.900
And it supports 20
Fellows per year

00:08:01.900 --> 00:08:03.400
that wants to work
in the developing

00:08:03.400 --> 00:08:05.210
world after graduation.

00:08:05.210 --> 00:08:10.420
So it's everybody from PhDs in
engineering to undergraduates.

00:08:10.420 --> 00:08:14.260
And so I came here
through a scholarship

00:08:14.260 --> 00:08:15.880
from the Legatum foundation.

00:08:15.880 --> 00:08:19.570
So I knew coming
in that I wanted

00:08:19.570 --> 00:08:24.950
to be an entrepreneur in the
developing world after Sloan.

00:08:24.950 --> 00:08:27.950
And my startup idea
is in agriculture,

00:08:27.950 --> 00:08:33.940
so it's another part of what
created this independent study.

00:08:33.940 --> 00:08:38.620
I knew some people
that I interviewed--

00:08:38.620 --> 00:08:41.044
some stakeholders that I
interviewed through Legatum,

00:08:41.044 --> 00:08:42.960
and then approaching
them as a Legatum Fellow,

00:08:42.960 --> 00:08:47.740
it made sense that I was
doing this agriculture paper.

00:08:47.740 --> 00:08:52.600
So it helped me talk to people
that I probably would have

00:08:52.600 --> 00:08:54.940
a hard time reaching out to.

00:08:54.940 --> 00:08:57.760
Anjali also brought in
her contacts for people

00:08:57.760 --> 00:09:02.710
that I needed to interview,
so that was helpful as well.

00:09:02.710 --> 00:09:05.170
And the name MIT was
helpful as well, so

00:09:05.170 --> 00:09:07.820
to link back to the
ecosystem, right?

00:09:07.820 --> 00:09:10.229
So reaching out to
someone and saying, hey,

00:09:10.229 --> 00:09:11.770
I'm a student at
MIT and I'm studying

00:09:11.770 --> 00:09:14.650
this topic was, I think,
helpful for people

00:09:14.650 --> 00:09:18.910
to open up their doors
and resources and such.

00:09:23.350 --> 00:09:26.157
I just came from a conference
last week after graduation.

00:09:26.157 --> 00:09:28.240
I went straight to a
conference at the World Bank,

00:09:28.240 --> 00:09:34.420
and I think everybody's
questioning this idea of

00:09:34.420 --> 00:09:36.210
is technology a good solution?

00:09:36.210 --> 00:09:38.950
And if so, how should
we be using it,

00:09:38.950 --> 00:09:44.140
and how do we really get these
rural communities to prosper?

00:09:44.140 --> 00:09:50.230
And there's a lot actually in
between farming seasons, right?

00:09:50.230 --> 00:09:53.180
So a farming season could
be just three months,

00:09:53.180 --> 00:09:55.660
and then you add the
preparation time, which

00:09:55.660 --> 00:09:57.610
is another couple of months.

00:09:57.610 --> 00:10:01.330
And then farmers are
going from cycle to cycle,

00:10:01.330 --> 00:10:05.380
and their conditions are
not really improving.

00:10:05.380 --> 00:10:07.300
So people are
questioning why that

00:10:07.300 --> 00:10:12.670
is happening, and we what we
need to do more of, or less of.

00:10:12.670 --> 00:10:15.310
So I think it's an
exciting sector,

00:10:15.310 --> 00:10:17.050
because I think that
the whole world is

00:10:17.050 --> 00:10:19.060
worried about food security.

00:10:19.060 --> 00:10:22.030
The whole world is worried
about climate change,

00:10:22.030 --> 00:10:24.670
which is linked to agriculture.

00:10:24.670 --> 00:10:26.422
So I think it's a hot topic.

00:10:26.422 --> 00:10:28.630
It's just people need to
figure out-- everybody needs

00:10:28.630 --> 00:10:30.850
to be on board in
terms of figuring out

00:10:30.850 --> 00:10:32.110
what needs to be done.

00:10:32.110 --> 00:10:33.610
Because on one hand,
you have people

00:10:33.610 --> 00:10:37.980
that are investing in
more production of food

00:10:37.980 --> 00:10:40.030
so that we have food
security, but then is

00:10:40.030 --> 00:10:43.540
that food distributed equally?

00:10:43.540 --> 00:10:45.740
That remains to be seen.

00:10:45.740 --> 00:10:47.650
And then on the
other hand, there's

00:10:47.650 --> 00:10:49.360
all this talk about
climate change

00:10:49.360 --> 00:10:51.891
and what farmers should
be doing or not be doing,

00:10:51.891 --> 00:10:53.890
and there are all these
technologies that people

00:10:53.890 --> 00:10:56.590
are coming up with, but
are they being co-created

00:10:56.590 --> 00:10:58.240
with the communities?

00:10:58.240 --> 00:10:59.080
Probably not.

00:10:59.080 --> 00:11:02.470
So uptake of those technologies
is slower than people think.

00:11:02.470 --> 00:11:06.910
So there are all of these
topics, all of these loose ends

00:11:06.910 --> 00:11:08.080
that need to be figured out.

00:11:08.080 --> 00:11:12.130
And I think that's why it's
exciting for me to be in,

00:11:12.130 --> 00:11:15.420
and hopefully I can figure
out a small part of it.
