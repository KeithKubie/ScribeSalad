00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:02.180
Solve for y.

00:00:02.180 --> 00:00:08.640
We have 3y plus 7 is less
than 2y and 4y plus 8

00:00:08.640 --> 00:00:10.934
is greater than negative 48.

00:00:10.934 --> 00:00:12.600
So we have to find
all the y's that meet

00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:14.260
both of these constraints.

00:00:14.260 --> 00:00:16.860
So let's just solve for y
in each of the constraints

00:00:16.860 --> 00:00:19.480
and just remember that
this "and" is here.

00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:24.200
So we have 3y plus
7 is less than 2y.

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:27.150
So let's isolate the y's
on the left-hand side.

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:29.650
So let's get rid of this
2y on the right-hand side,

00:00:29.650 --> 00:00:34.080
and we can do that by
subtracting 2y from both sides.

00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:37.650
So we're going to subtract
2y from both sides.

00:00:37.650 --> 00:00:41.190
The left-hand side, we have
3y minus 2y, which is just y,

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:44.969
plus 7 is less than 2y minus 2y.

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:46.260
And there's nothing else there.

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:48.780
That's just going to be 0.

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:50.260
And then we can
get rid of this 7

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:53.620
here by subtracting
7 from both sides.

00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:56.470
So let's subtract
7 from both sides.

00:00:56.470 --> 00:00:58.970
Left-hand side,
y plus 7 minus 7.

00:00:58.970 --> 00:00:59.780
Those cancel out.

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:05.216
We just have y is less than 0
minus 7, which is negative 7.

00:01:05.216 --> 00:01:06.590
So that's one of
the constraints.

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:09.000
That's this constraint
right over here.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.710
Now let's work on
this constraint.

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:19.400
We have 4y plus 8 is
greater than negative 48.

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:21.700
So let's get rid of the 8
from the left-hand side.

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:23.640
So we can subtract
8 from both sides.

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:30.930
The left-hand side,
we're just left with a 4y

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:32.400
because these guys cancel out.

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:36.950
4y is greater than
negative 48 minus 8.

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:38.830
So we're going to go
another 8 negative.

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:43.840
So 48 plus 8 would
be a 56, so this

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:47.090
is going to be negative 56.

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:49.300
And now to isolate the y,
we can divide both sides

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:52.120
by positive 4, and we don't
have to swap the inequality

00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:54.790
since we're dividing
by a positive number.

00:01:54.790 --> 00:01:57.800
So it's divide both
sides by 4 over here.

00:01:57.800 --> 00:02:05.210
So we get y is greater than--
what is 56/4, or negative 56/4?

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:05.710
Let's see.

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:09.750
40 is 10 times 4, and then we
have another 16 to worry about.

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:10.970
So it's 14 times 4.

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:15.467
So y is greater
than negative 14.

00:02:15.467 --> 00:02:16.050
Is that right?

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:18.512
4 times 10 is 40,
4 times 4 is 16.

00:02:18.512 --> 00:02:19.750
Yep, 56.

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:24.600
So y is greater than negative
14 and-- let's remember,

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:29.690
we have this "and" here-- and
y is less than negative 7.

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:32.670
So we have to meet both of
these constraints over here.

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:36.940
So let's draw them
on the number line.

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:40.460
So I have my number
line over here.

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:45.710
And let's say negative
14 is over here.

00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:49.829
So you have negative
13, 12, 11, 10, 9, 8,

00:02:49.829 --> 00:02:54.252
7-- that's negative 7-- and
then negative 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1.

00:02:54.252 --> 00:02:55.710
This would be 0,
and then you could

00:02:55.710 --> 00:02:58.080
keep going up more positive.

00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:00.350
And so we're looking
for all of the y's that

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:02.820
are less than negative 7.

00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:06.020
So let's look at this,
less than negative 7.

00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:07.910
So not including
negative 7, so we'll

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:10.190
do an open circle
around negative 7,

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:12.400
and less than negative 7.

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:13.900
And if that was the
only constraint,

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:15.530
we would keep going to the left.

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:17.720
But we have this other
constraint-- and y

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:19.610
has to be greater
than negative 14.

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:26.010
So you make a circle
around negative 14,

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:27.870
and everything that's
greater than that.

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:28.960
And if you didn't have
this other constraint,

00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:30.340
you would keep going.

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:34.060
But the y's that
satisfy both of them

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:35.920
are all of the y's in between.

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:41.650
These are the y's that are
both less than negative 7

00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:43.770
and greater than negative 14.

00:03:43.770 --> 00:03:46.440
And we can verify
that things here work.

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:48.930
So let's try some values out.

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:50.450
So a value that
would work, well,

00:03:50.450 --> 00:03:52.140
let me just do
negative 10 is right

00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:54.060
here, 8, 9, this is negative 10.

00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:54.910
That should work.

00:03:54.910 --> 00:03:56.140
So let's try it out.

00:03:56.140 --> 00:04:02.130
So we'd have 3 times
negative 10 plus 7 should

00:04:02.130 --> 00:04:05.140
be less than 2
times negative 10.

00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:09.280
So this is negative 30 plus
7 is negative 23, which

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:11.450
is indeed less than negative 20.

00:04:11.450 --> 00:04:12.500
So that works.

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:15.610
And negative 10 has to
work for this one as well.

00:04:15.610 --> 00:04:20.329
So you have 4 times negative 10,
which is negative 40, plus 8.

00:04:20.329 --> 00:04:25.220
Negative 40 plus 8 should
be greater than negative 48.

00:04:25.220 --> 00:04:28.870
Well, negative 40
plus 8 is negative 32.

00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:31.200
We're going 8 in the
positive direction,

00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:32.980
so we're getting less negative.

00:04:32.980 --> 00:04:36.740
And negative 32 is
greater than negative 48.

00:04:36.740 --> 00:04:38.750
It's less negative.

00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:40.150
So this works.

00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:42.300
So negative 10 works.

00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:45.000
Now, let's just verify some
things that shouldn't work.

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:48.370
So 0 should not work.

00:04:48.370 --> 00:04:49.747
It's not in the solution set.

00:04:49.747 --> 00:04:50.580
So let's try it out.

00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:53.280
We've got 3 times is 0 plus 7.

00:04:53.280 --> 00:04:54.550
That would be 7.

00:04:54.550 --> 00:04:58.350
And 7 is not less than 0.

00:04:58.350 --> 00:05:00.980
So it would violate this
condition right over here

00:05:00.980 --> 00:05:02.650
if we put a 0 over here.

00:05:02.650 --> 00:05:05.630
If you put a negative
15 over here,

00:05:05.630 --> 00:05:08.450
it should violate this
condition right over here

00:05:08.450 --> 00:05:10.780
because it wasn't in
this guy's solution set.

00:05:10.780 --> 00:05:13.280
Anyway, hopefully you
found that useful.
