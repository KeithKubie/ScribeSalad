00:00:00.540 --> 00:00:02.305
- [Voiceover] So we've
got the function g here,

00:00:02.305 --> 00:00:04.789
and what I want you to
do is pause the video

00:00:04.789 --> 00:00:06.763
and figure out what g of one is,

00:00:06.763 --> 00:00:08.968
figure out what g of two is,

00:00:08.968 --> 00:00:13.334
g of three, and g of four.

00:00:13.334 --> 00:00:16.143
Figure out what all four of these are.

00:00:16.143 --> 00:00:18.303
All right, now let's work
through this together.

00:00:18.303 --> 00:00:22.134
So g of one, if n is equal to one,

00:00:22.134 --> 00:00:23.922
well, then we're gonna hit
this case right over here,

00:00:23.922 --> 00:00:27.242
if n is equal to one, g is equal to four.

00:00:27.242 --> 00:00:29.332
So that was pretty straightforward.

00:00:29.332 --> 00:00:31.816
Now, g of two,

00:00:31.816 --> 00:00:33.837
if n is equal to two,

00:00:33.837 --> 00:00:36.902
well, two is greater than
one and it's a whole number,

00:00:36.902 --> 00:00:38.828
and so we would use this case.

00:00:38.828 --> 00:00:39.688
And this is interesting,

00:00:39.688 --> 00:00:41.847
because it's defined in
terms of the function,

00:00:41.847 --> 00:00:43.728
but it's not defined in terms of g of n,

00:00:43.728 --> 00:00:45.864
but g of n minus one.

00:00:45.864 --> 00:00:48.859
So if n is two, 'cause we're
evaluating g of two here,

00:00:48.859 --> 00:00:51.715
this is going to be g of two minus one,

00:00:51.715 --> 00:00:55.845
or g of one, plus 3.2.

00:00:55.845 --> 00:00:58.215
Plus 3.2.

00:00:58.215 --> 00:00:59.793
Well, what's that going to be?

00:00:59.793 --> 00:01:02.695
Well, g of one, we know is equal to four.

00:01:02.695 --> 00:01:04.298
We just figured that out.

00:01:04.298 --> 00:01:08.969
So four plus 3.2, that is 7.2.

00:01:09.359 --> 00:01:10.690
All right, let's keep going.

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:13.472
G of three, we're gonna
fall into this case again,

00:01:13.472 --> 00:01:16.266
because three is greater than
one and it's a whole number.

00:01:16.266 --> 00:01:20.005
So this is going to be
g of three minus one,

00:01:20.005 --> 00:01:23.451
or g of two, plus 3.2.

00:01:23.451 --> 00:01:24.721
Plus 3.2.

00:01:24.721 --> 00:01:27.794
Well, we know what g of two is. It's 7.2.

00:01:27.794 --> 00:01:30.964
We just figured that out. It is 7.2.

00:01:30.964 --> 00:01:34.083
7.2 plus 3.2 is going

00:01:34.083 --> 00:01:37.183
to be equal to 10.4.

00:01:37.183 --> 00:01:40.321
And then g of four,
well, we fall here again.

00:01:40.321 --> 00:01:43.041
This is gonna be g of three plus 3.2.

00:01:43.041 --> 00:01:47.174
G of three plus 3.2.

00:01:47.174 --> 00:01:49.014
What is that going to be equal to?

00:01:49.014 --> 00:01:51.700
Well, g of three we just
figured out is 10.4.

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:54.392
10.4 plus 3.2 is going

00:01:54.392 --> 00:01:57.352
to be 13.6.

00:01:57.352 --> 00:01:58.456
And so what you have here,

00:01:58.456 --> 00:01:59.942
this is actually quite interesting.

00:01:59.942 --> 00:02:03.449
You can think of this function g,

00:02:03.449 --> 00:02:06.955
and we see that it's defined
over all positive integers.

00:02:06.955 --> 00:02:08.766
Because it's defined
over positive integers,

00:02:08.766 --> 00:02:11.041
we could think of it
as defining a sequence,

00:02:11.041 --> 00:02:12.598
and we see what the sequence here is.

00:02:12.598 --> 00:02:16.335
The first term is four,

00:02:16.335 --> 00:02:19.625
second term is 7.2,

00:02:19.625 --> 00:02:23.035
next term is 10.4,

00:02:23.035 --> 00:02:25.965
next term is 13.6,

00:02:25.965 --> 00:02:27.968
and it could keep going on and on and on.

00:02:27.968 --> 00:02:30.986
And what's happening? What's
happening in this sequence?

00:02:30.986 --> 00:02:32.867
Well, we're starting with four.

00:02:32.867 --> 00:02:34.121
We're starting with four,

00:02:34.121 --> 00:02:36.629
and this case of the
function gave us that.

00:02:36.629 --> 00:02:38.436
If n is equal to four,

00:02:38.436 --> 00:02:40.204
if n is equal to one,

00:02:40.204 --> 00:02:42.086
the function is going to be equal to four,

00:02:42.086 --> 00:02:44.524
and then for each term after that,

00:02:44.524 --> 00:02:47.425
you take the previous
term and you add 3.2.

00:02:47.425 --> 00:02:51.419
So we add 3.2 for the
second term, we add 3.2,

00:02:51.419 --> 00:02:53.473
so we just keep adding,

00:02:53.473 --> 00:02:58.293
we just keep adding 3.2,

00:02:58.293 --> 00:03:02.982
not .32, 3.2 to get to the next term.

00:03:02.982 --> 00:03:04.676
Now, we could've defined it
that way, we could've said,

00:03:04.676 --> 00:03:06.546
"Hey, let's have a sequence
where the first term is four

00:03:06.546 --> 00:03:10.120
"and then we keep adding
3.2 to get each next term."

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:12.781
But this is another
interesting way of defining it.

00:03:12.781 --> 00:03:14.243
And this way of defining it,

00:03:14.243 --> 00:03:16.589
where we defined it as
an algebraic function,

00:03:16.589 --> 00:03:19.793
a function that's defined
over all positive integers,

00:03:19.793 --> 00:03:21.302
where we have a base case.

00:03:21.302 --> 00:03:22.745
And a base case, really, in this case,

00:03:22.745 --> 00:03:24.483
gave us our first term,

00:03:24.483 --> 00:03:25.876
and then we have this other case

00:03:25.876 --> 00:03:28.082
that's defined in terms of the function.

00:03:28.082 --> 00:03:30.079
Then you have to recurse backwards

00:03:30.079 --> 00:03:32.099
to eventually get to a base case.

00:03:32.099 --> 00:03:34.816
We call this a recursive function.

00:03:34.816 --> 00:03:38.786
Recursive function.

00:03:38.786 --> 00:03:40.366
So with this example, we're seeing

00:03:40.366 --> 00:03:42.827
how a recursive function can be used

00:03:42.827 --> 00:03:45.636
to define an actual sequence.

00:03:45.636 --> 00:03:47.656
And we went in order here,

00:03:47.656 --> 00:03:48.910
but you could've gone
the other way around.

00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:52.499
If I said, "Oh, well, what's g of,

00:03:52.499 --> 00:03:54.629
"what's g of six?"

00:03:54.629 --> 00:03:55.945
Well, you'd go into this case, you'd say,

00:03:55.945 --> 00:04:00.008
"OK, that's going to
be g of five plus 3.2."

00:04:00.008 --> 00:04:03.398
It's gonna be the previous term plus 3.2

00:04:03.398 --> 00:04:05.650
if we view it as a sequence.

00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:06.533
Well, then we're gonna have to figure out

00:04:06.533 --> 00:04:07.438
what the previous term is.

00:04:07.438 --> 00:04:11.138
G of five is going to be g of four,

00:04:11.138 --> 00:04:14.278
g of four plus 3.2,

00:04:14.278 --> 00:04:16.262
and you would keep going
back and back and back,

00:04:16.262 --> 00:04:18.119
but we've already figured
out what g of four is.

00:04:18.119 --> 00:04:21.487
It's 13.6,

00:04:21.487 --> 00:04:25.357
so this is 16.8,

00:04:25.357 --> 00:04:29.496
and then if g of five is 16.8,

00:04:29.496 --> 00:04:33.095
16.8, you add 3.2 there, you would get 20.

00:04:33.095 --> 00:04:34.980
So you could start at g of
six and keep backing up,

00:04:34.980 --> 00:04:36.350
all the way until you get to g of one,

00:04:36.350 --> 00:04:37.719
and then you figure out what that is.

00:04:37.719 --> 00:04:40.274
You recurse back to your base case,

00:04:40.274 --> 00:04:43.292
and then you're able to
fill in all of the blanks.

00:04:43.292 --> 00:04:45.241
Let's do a few more examples of this.

00:04:46.311 --> 00:04:48.191
So we have this function here.

00:04:48.191 --> 00:04:50.606
So let's say that this defines a sequence.

00:04:50.606 --> 00:04:52.603
Let's think about what
the first four terms

00:04:52.603 --> 00:04:54.089
of that sequence are, and once again,

00:04:54.089 --> 00:04:56.389
I encourage you to pause the
video and figure that out.

00:04:57.409 --> 00:04:59.453
All right, let's work through it.

00:04:59.453 --> 00:05:03.562
So h of one is, well,
they very clearly tell us

00:05:03.562 --> 00:05:04.747
that's going to be 14.

00:05:04.747 --> 00:05:07.811
If n is equal to one, h is 14.

00:05:07.811 --> 00:05:11.172
H of two,

00:05:11.172 --> 00:05:13.242
well, now we're falling into this case,

00:05:13.242 --> 00:05:15.659
'cause two is greater than
one and it's a whole number,

00:05:15.659 --> 00:05:19.336
so it's gonna be 28 over h of one,

00:05:19.336 --> 00:05:21.246
over h of one.

00:05:21.246 --> 00:05:22.973
Well, we know h of one is 14,

00:05:22.973 --> 00:05:26.738
so it's gonna be 28 over
14, which is equal to two.

00:05:26.738 --> 00:05:29.572
Now h of three.

00:05:29.572 --> 00:05:32.358
H of three, we're gonna
fall into this case again.

00:05:32.358 --> 00:05:34.053
It's gonna be 28,

00:05:34.053 --> 00:05:38.083
28 divided by h of two,

00:05:38.083 --> 00:05:39.462
if we're thinking of this as a sequence,

00:05:39.462 --> 00:05:42.388
divided by the previous
term in the sequence.

00:05:42.388 --> 00:05:43.990
So 28 divided by h of two,

00:05:43.990 --> 00:05:47.875
we know that h of two is equal to,

00:05:47.875 --> 00:05:49.215
is equal to two.

00:05:49.215 --> 00:05:50.050
We just figured that out.

00:05:50.050 --> 00:05:52.674
So we go back to 14,
something very interesting.

00:05:52.674 --> 00:05:54.440
I think you see where this is going.

00:05:54.440 --> 00:05:58.943
H of four is gonna be 28
divided by h of three,

00:05:58.943 --> 00:06:02.301
28 divided by h of three,

00:06:02.301 --> 00:06:04.251
which is 28 divided by,

00:06:04.251 --> 00:06:05.414
this is h of three right over here,

00:06:05.414 --> 00:06:06.386
we just figured that out,

00:06:06.386 --> 00:06:09.276
divided by 14, which is back to two.

00:06:09.276 --> 00:06:12.387
If we were to think of this as a sequence,

00:06:12.387 --> 00:06:16.033
we'd say, "All right, let's
see, the first term is 14,

00:06:16.033 --> 00:06:19.245
"then we get to two,

00:06:19.245 --> 00:06:21.055
"then we go to 14,

00:06:21.055 --> 00:06:22.235
"then we get to two."

00:06:22.235 --> 00:06:24.020
So one way to think about this sequence is

00:06:24.020 --> 00:06:27.317
that we just keep alternating
between 14 and twos.

00:06:27.317 --> 00:06:31.009
All of the odd terms
of the sequence are 14,

00:06:31.009 --> 00:06:32.890
all of the even terms
of the sequence are two.

00:06:32.890 --> 00:06:34.817
That's one way to think about it.

00:06:34.817 --> 00:06:36.328
Or another way to think about it is,

00:06:36.328 --> 00:06:38.346
we're starting with 14,

00:06:38.346 --> 00:06:42.015
and each successive term is
the previous term divided,

00:06:42.015 --> 00:06:45.126
is 28 divided by the previous term.

00:06:45.126 --> 00:06:48.284
So here, 28 divided by 14 is two.

00:06:48.284 --> 00:06:51.813
28 divided by two is 14.
28 divided by 14 is two.

00:06:51.813 --> 00:06:53.206
And we keep going on and on and on,

00:06:53.206 --> 00:06:57.223
and that's what was actually
going on right over there.

00:06:57.223 --> 00:06:58.582
Let's do one more of these.

00:06:59.592 --> 00:07:00.776
And this one is interesting,

00:07:00.776 --> 00:07:02.026
because we now have,

00:07:02.026 --> 00:07:06.636
we now have two base cases.

00:07:06.636 --> 00:07:08.397
So let's think about this.

00:07:08.397 --> 00:07:10.716
This is, and actually let's just say

00:07:10.716 --> 00:07:14.450
we wanted to figure out, we
wanted to figure out what,

00:07:14.450 --> 00:07:17.050
what f of four is.

00:07:17.050 --> 00:07:20.436
F of four, well, we're
gonna fall into this case.

00:07:20.436 --> 00:07:22.410
Four is greater than two
and it's a whole number.

00:07:22.410 --> 00:07:24.732
It's gonna be f of four minus two,

00:07:24.732 --> 00:07:29.440
so it's gonna be f of two
plus f of four minus one,

00:07:29.440 --> 00:07:31.460
plus f of three.

00:07:31.460 --> 00:07:32.830
So f of four is gonna be the sum

00:07:32.830 --> 00:07:35.338
of the preceding two numbers.

00:07:35.338 --> 00:07:36.360
All right, so let's figure out

00:07:36.360 --> 00:07:38.728
what f of three is going to be.

00:07:38.728 --> 00:07:40.725
F of three, we fall into this case again,

00:07:40.725 --> 00:07:43.987
it's gonna be f of three
minus two is f of one,

00:07:44.927 --> 00:07:48.642
plus f of three minus one, plus f of two,

00:07:48.642 --> 00:07:51.243
the sum of the preceding two numbers.

00:07:51.243 --> 00:07:53.727
So let's figure out what
f of two is going to be.

00:07:53.727 --> 00:07:54.772
Well, now we're not doing the sum

00:07:54.772 --> 00:07:56.212
of the preceding two numbers anymore.

00:07:56.212 --> 00:07:59.277
We fall into this base
case. N is now equal to two.

00:07:59.277 --> 00:08:01.274
It's going to be equal to negative four.

00:08:01.274 --> 00:08:02.435
And we're gonna have to figure out

00:08:02.435 --> 00:08:04.408
what f of one is as well.

00:08:04.408 --> 00:08:06.010
And we see when n is equal to one,

00:08:06.010 --> 00:08:07.891
f is equal to negative six.

00:08:07.891 --> 00:08:10.306
We have two base cases right over here.

00:08:10.306 --> 00:08:13.928
Base cases, cases that aren't defined

00:08:13.928 --> 00:08:15.344
in terms of the function itself.

00:08:15.344 --> 00:08:16.296
And you need that,

00:08:16.296 --> 00:08:18.061
'cause otherwise you'd
just be recursing forever.

00:08:18.061 --> 00:08:20.615
You would never get to actual numbers.

00:08:20.615 --> 00:08:23.502
But now we can use these to
fill in the values up here.

00:08:23.502 --> 00:08:26.954
So the sequence is negative six,

00:08:26.954 --> 00:08:29.833
then we go to negative
four as the second term,

00:08:29.833 --> 00:08:32.016
and then the third term is
the sum of the previous two.

00:08:32.016 --> 00:08:36.613
Negative six plus negative
four is negative 10.

00:08:36.613 --> 00:08:40.119
Negative six plus negative
four is negative 10.

00:08:40.119 --> 00:08:42.371
And then the fourth term is
the sum of the previous two.

00:08:42.371 --> 00:08:43.416
We see it right over here.

00:08:43.416 --> 00:08:45.854
The second term, f of
two, plus f of three.

00:08:45.854 --> 00:08:50.173
Negative four plus
negative 10 is negative 14.

00:08:50.173 --> 00:08:53.122
And we could keep going on
and on and on like that.

00:08:53.122 --> 00:08:55.815
So this right over here is negative 14.

00:08:55.815 --> 00:08:57.324
So the whole point of this video,

00:08:57.324 --> 00:08:59.809
you're a little bit familiar
with recursive functions now,

00:08:59.809 --> 00:09:01.573
and also you can see how these can be used

00:09:01.573 --> 00:09:04.638
to define actual sequences.
