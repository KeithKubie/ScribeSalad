00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.500
[Captions by Y Translator]
Today, we're going
to be taking a look

00:00:01.500 --> 00:00:04.800
at a very old-fashioned way
to heat up a fire, hot enough

00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:06.500
that it can melt metal.

00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:12.260
[Music]

00:00:12.260 --> 00:00:13.800
I'm here again
with my friend Joseph,

00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:16.200
and we've got some leather
and some other supplies,

00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:18.900
and Joseph is going to teach us
how to make a Bellows

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:20.900
that can heat up a fire
hot enough to melt metal.

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:21.702
&gt;&gt; Is that right?
&gt;&gt; Yes.

00:00:22.392 --> 00:00:23.100
&gt;&gt; Very cool.

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:24.500
&gt;&gt; Yes, and this is
for an upcoming project

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:27.500
where we're actually going
to try making iron from scratch,

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:29.340
just like the Vikings did.

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:31.600
&gt;&gt; But one of the key points
for that is you need to get

00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:34.172
a fire just unbelievably
hot to do that, right?

00:00:34.172 --> 00:00:34.600
&gt;&gt; Yes.

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:36.600
Well, less hot than you think.

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:37.700
Because when you make iron,

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:39.262
you actually never
actually melt it.

00:00:39.852 --> 00:00:42.400
Melting iron like that
was invented way way way

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:44.900
after we had swords and stuff.

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:47.320
&gt;&gt; And how hot are we going for?

00:00:47.482 --> 00:00:48.900
&gt;&gt; About a little
over 2,000 degrees.

00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:50.592
&gt;&gt; Over 2,000 degrees.

00:00:50.592 --> 00:00:51.600
&gt;&gt; Okay, so not that hot.

00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:53.300
&gt;&gt; And how long does it have to go?

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:54.200
&gt;&gt; Like seven hours.

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:55.202
&gt;&gt; Seven hours.

00:00:55.202 --> 00:00:56.200
&gt;&gt; That is a long time.

00:00:56.200 --> 00:01:00.000
That would take probably several
propane tanks worth of fuel,

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:01.600
but we're not going
to use propane.

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:02.700
We're going to
be using charcoal.

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:06.400
&gt;&gt; Yes, and cheeseburgers to power
the human powered Bellows,

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:08.400
or maybe not cheeseburgers.

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:09.800
&gt;&gt; Here's the basic idea.

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:11.000
We've got a bunch of leather,

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.492
and we're going to cut
and sew that into a shape

00:01:13.792 --> 00:01:16.900
that lets us control the flow
of air heating up a fire.

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:18.900
So let's look at some
of those supplies we've got.

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:21.722
First off, a Russian
olive tree,branch.

00:01:21.722 --> 00:01:22.900
&gt;&gt; Yes, and the thing

00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:25.000
that's important about this one
is it's got nasty spikes

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:26.322
on it, all over the place.

00:01:26.322 --> 00:01:27.160
&gt;&gt; What?

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:28.300
It's a fairly durable,

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:30.820
rigid spike and
it's quite sharp,

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:33.200
and this is one of the tools
we're going to be trying to use

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:34.500
to poke holes in the leather.

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:36.900
&gt; So we're going to give a try
and see how it goes,

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:39.780
trying to make holes
with this to sew it together.

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:41.600
I mean, we're
thinking primitive here.

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:42.900
So no sewing needle,
that would be cheating.

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:44.000
&gt;&gt; We might cheat.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:45.952
&gt;&gt; Just a little bit
if this doesn't work at all.

00:01:45.952 --> 00:01:47.800
We'll try some of the primitive,

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:51.100
and then for the sake of speed,
we'll probably cheat.

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:52.000
Speaking of cheating,

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:54.700
these are very
nicely round sticks,

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:57.460
and I did not harvest these
off of a tree myself.

00:01:57.460 --> 00:01:59.400
I harvested these from Walmart.

00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:02.200
But for this having a perfectly
straight smooth stick,

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:03.800
that's really not important
for what we're going to use.

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:05.600
These are going
to be sort of handles

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:08.800
at the top of our Bellows
that we can open and close

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:10.400
as we manipulate them.

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:11.582
Now, we have a piece of antler.

00:02:11.702 --> 00:02:13.700
I don't know if that's
as pointy as the thorns,

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:15.120
but it's probably
a lot stronger.

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:16.140
&gt;&gt; Yes, probably.

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:16.700
Bamboo.

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:17.820
Why do we have bamboo?

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:19.000
&gt;&gt; Bamboo is for the air pipe.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.700
So we're going to have
a bag made out of leather

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:24.600
with two sticks of the top
that you pinch closed.

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:26.700
So you open up
for air this way,

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:28.380
then you close and push down.

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:30.800
But the air needed somewhere
to go out to go to the fire,

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:31.862
and that's what this is for.

00:02:31.862 --> 00:02:33.740
&gt;&gt; So this is what we use
to direct the air.

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:34.072
Yes.

00:02:34.072 --> 00:02:35.000
Just where we want it.

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:36.500
Now, bamboo will burn.

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:38.302
What's the strategy
for preventing that?

00:02:38.362 --> 00:02:39.600
&gt;&gt; We will coat the tip in clay.

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:41.800
&gt;&gt; And then of course,
we have leather.

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:43.400
This is quite
a bit of leather,

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:44.700
and again, we cheated.

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:47.200
We did not tan
the leather ourselves.

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:51.200
So we have quite a big sheet
of really nice tough leather.

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:54.800
This is actually more industrial
than it needs to be like...

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:55.120
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:56.680
&gt;&gt; This is pretty thick,

00:02:57.382 --> 00:03:01.500
pretty high quality, tanned hide,
and this is really a lot nicer than we need.

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:02.700
&gt;&gt; But, if it's super robust,

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:04.000
and that means we can use
it for a long time.

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:04.760
Yeah.

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:06.220
This is artificial sinew.

00:03:06.252 --> 00:03:07.200
In the old days,

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:08.800
they would take tendons
from a dead animal,

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:11.780
but like the cow,
we didn't want to do that.

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:13.400
So this is a replicated stuff

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:15.500
made of just
some very fine fibers,

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:17.212
and coated with wax.

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:19.000
We'll probably use this
for most of the sewing.

00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:21.100
So what's going
to be our first step?

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:23.100
&gt;&gt; First step, we need
to measure out exactly

00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:24.800
what we want the Bellows
to look like,

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:27.380
and that's going to be dependent
on how much leather we have.

00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:29.800
&gt;&gt; We're going to do
four side panels,

00:03:29.820 --> 00:03:30.900
and two bottom panels.

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:32.200
The goal is to make to Bellows.

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:32.600
&gt;&gt; Yes.

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:34.100
And I think that's
because that way,

00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:35.200
as you're pumping air,

00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:37.400
you can always have
one pushing air in,

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:39.000
while the other
one is refilling.

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:39.862
&gt;&gt; Yes, and one,

00:03:40.092 --> 00:03:42.000
it does two things,
it regulates the airflow,

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:45.200
and it also prevents the air
from the Bellows from sucking

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:46.200
air in from the fire,

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:48.620
which would burn it,
and cause problems.

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:50.000
&gt;&gt; All right, we're going to use

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:53.800
this very authentic primitive
technology chalk marker.

00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:55.752
So let's make four rectangles.

00:03:55.752 --> 00:03:56.592
&gt;&gt; Four rectangles.

00:03:56.600 --> 00:03:57.100
the sides,

00:03:57.100 --> 00:04:00.182
and you are saying we want
them about one cubit long,

00:04:00.372 --> 00:04:02.502
and not quite a cubit tall.

00:04:02.822 --> 00:04:03.700
Cubit, if you don't know,

00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:06.900
is the distance from your elbow
to the tips of your fingers.

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:09.500
I don't know the exact scale,
but of course, as you get taller,

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:11.600
your arms also get
a little bit longer.

00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:14.100
So let's instead
of the full qubit.

00:04:14.100 --> 00:04:16.200
Let's just take it
down by a few inches.

00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:18.100
&gt;&gt; Maybe the top of the top
of the first knuckles.

00:04:18.100 --> 00:04:20.542
Very precise caveman
style measuring here.

00:04:20.542 --> 00:04:25.900
[Music]

00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:26.600
To save time however,

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:28.500
we're going to use
this pair of industrially

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:30.100
large sharp scissors.

00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:33.320
[Music]

00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:37.500
We've got four rectangle-ish
pieces of leather cut out.

00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:38.000
&gt;&gt; Yes.

00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:41.100
So now we want a bottom piece
that you had a flat.

00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:44.600
I'm thinking just kind
of like almond-shaped.

00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:46.600
&gt;&gt; Yes, almond-shaped would be
just about right.

00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:49.562
&gt;&gt; Eyeball almond
that goes out and then...

00:04:49.820 --> 00:04:50.500
&gt;&gt; football.

00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:51.400
&gt;&gt; You take the marker.

00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:52.120
&gt;&gt; Okey-dokey.

00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:53.200
&gt;&gt; I'm just going to take
this piece of leather,

00:04:53.200 --> 00:04:55.400
and hold it, sort of up
in this curve shape,

00:04:55.400 --> 00:04:57.500
and then you can just draw
along that curve,

00:04:57.500 --> 00:04:58.932
and then we'll know
it's the right length.

00:04:58.940 --> 00:05:06.940
[Music]

00:05:06.940 --> 00:05:08.500
So we've got a bunch of pieces.

00:05:08.500 --> 00:05:10.562
We now need to
sew them together.

00:05:10.932 --> 00:05:12.500
&gt;&gt; So, the order to do that in...

00:05:12.500 --> 00:05:14.200
I figured we'll just sew

00:05:14.200 --> 00:05:17.692
along the sides, to make kind
of a envelope shape,

00:05:17.700 --> 00:05:19.372
and then put the bottom on.

00:05:19.592 --> 00:05:21.800
&gt;&gt; Joseph is going
to harvest a thorn.

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:24.132
He just slapped me with this.

00:05:24.812 --> 00:05:25.900
Fortunately, the part

00:05:25.900 --> 00:05:28.600
that hit me did not seem
to have any thorns on it.

00:05:28.682 --> 00:05:29.182
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:05:32.132 --> 00:05:34.220
&gt;&gt; How are we doing on stabbing
a hole in leather with a thorn.

00:05:34.220 --> 00:05:37.180
&gt;&gt; Well, I've broken three or
four points off of this thorn.

00:05:38.320 --> 00:05:39.700
&gt;&gt; Now, I actually did stab a hole

00:05:39.700 --> 00:05:41.500
in this leather with one
of these thorns before,

00:05:41.500 --> 00:05:42.900
but I'm now struggling to do so.

00:05:43.560 --> 00:05:45.500
It's just the the
leather is winning.

00:05:46.300 --> 00:05:48.500
There are lots of primitive ways

00:05:48.500 --> 00:05:50.400
of making needles that can even
get through leather.

00:05:50.400 --> 00:05:52.400
There are other types of
natural thorn that are harder,

00:05:52.500 --> 00:05:53.300
that are sharper.

00:05:53.300 --> 00:05:55.500
We've got a piece of antler
that we can get through.

00:05:55.500 --> 00:05:58.100
It's very wide,
very quickly though.

00:05:58.200 --> 00:06:00.700
So in that rich
tradition of cheating,

00:06:00.700 --> 00:06:02.912
we've also got
some metal needles,

00:06:03.642 --> 00:06:05.200
which even have eye holes

00:06:05.200 --> 00:06:06.900
in them to stab right
through the leather,

00:06:06.900 --> 00:06:10.400
and we're going to use those,
because I love metal tools.

00:06:10.400 --> 00:06:11.222
They're great.

00:06:12.272 --> 00:06:13.812
Poke a hole through both layers.

00:06:16.462 --> 00:06:18.072
That stabbed through
fairly easily.

00:06:19.462 --> 00:06:22.062
We have our sinew poked through.

00:06:25.682 --> 00:06:26.812
Kind of near the first one.

00:06:28.082 --> 00:06:31.492
Again, it pulls
the sinew through.

00:06:32.800 --> 00:06:33.652
But now,

00:06:34.372 --> 00:06:37.500
while we still have this loop,
we take the other end,

00:06:37.500 --> 00:06:38.700
this long end,

00:06:38.700 --> 00:06:42.780
and poke it through that hole,
and pull it all the way.

00:06:42.780 --> 00:06:45.200
And now, when we pull
that loop down tight,

00:06:45.600 --> 00:06:47.800
we have a stitch right in place,

00:06:47.800 --> 00:06:49.600
and we have one
on the other side as well.

00:06:49.600 --> 00:06:51.200
So we just need
to keep doing that,

00:06:51.200 --> 00:06:54.782
and go down the line,
poking a hole, creating a loop,

00:06:55.192 --> 00:06:56.700
feeding the sinew through that,

00:06:56.700 --> 00:06:58.702
and just sewing
the whole thing shut.

00:06:58.702 --> 00:07:06.740
[Music]

00:07:06.740 --> 00:07:09.200
And, on my second side,
I am going to leave a gap.

00:07:10.300 --> 00:07:11.300
Just a couple of inches

00:07:11.300 --> 00:07:14.300
so that we can either just
tie the pipe right onto that,

00:07:14.300 --> 00:07:16.292
or add our little pipe sleeve.

00:07:16.300 --> 00:07:32.360
[Music]

00:07:32.400 --> 00:07:36.992
All right. This bag has one side,
two sides, and the bottom sewn on.

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:38.100
I've left this gap here.

00:07:38.100 --> 00:07:39.800
This is we're going to try
and attach our pipe.

00:07:39.800 --> 00:07:40.600
But for the moment,

00:07:40.600 --> 00:07:43.600
we're just going to make a mess
by putting some sawdust there,

00:07:43.600 --> 00:07:45.500
and showing that
if I have this bag,

00:07:45.500 --> 00:07:47.642
and I pinch the top closed,

00:07:49.332 --> 00:07:52.400
we get a good amount of air
flying out of the exit there

00:07:52.412 --> 00:07:52.762
so...

00:07:52.762 --> 00:08:00.160
[Music]

00:08:00.280 --> 00:08:01.200
Mess is everywhere.

00:08:01.600 --> 00:08:04.000
Joseph going to keep stitching
up the bottom of that one.

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:05.200
I'm going to start adding

00:08:05.200 --> 00:08:07.400
some sticks onto the top
and bottom of this,

00:08:07.400 --> 00:08:09.000
and we're just going to make it,

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:11.300
so they fit pretty
nicely in there,

00:08:11.300 --> 00:08:12.500
and just have a few stitches.

00:08:12.500 --> 00:08:14.100
We don't need to stitch
all the way along.

00:08:14.400 --> 00:08:17.100
I'll probably have
three to five bind points.

00:08:17.100 --> 00:08:19.782
Whatever seems like it's necessary
to really hold it in place.

00:08:21.352 --> 00:08:23.372
Open it, pulls an air
from the top.

00:08:23.602 --> 00:08:25.420
Close it, pushes the air
out the bottom.

00:08:25.420 --> 00:08:46.520
[Music]

00:08:46.520 --> 00:08:47.800
Okay, update.

00:08:47.800 --> 00:08:51.200
This first Bellows is
I believe complete,

00:08:51.200 --> 00:08:52.280
and in working order.

00:08:52.300 --> 00:08:53.900
Joseph is getting
really good progress.

00:08:53.900 --> 00:08:55.272
He's got one more seam

00:08:55.272 --> 00:08:57.600
to finish on his, and then
a couple sticks and handles,

00:08:57.600 --> 00:08:59.920
but we did want to show you
where this one is.

00:08:59.920 --> 00:09:00.800
Handles up at the top.

00:09:00.800 --> 00:09:02.000
We've got these sticks in here.

00:09:02.200 --> 00:09:03.000
Those are rigid.

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:06.700
So when we squeeze that,
it holds the whole bag top shut.

00:09:06.700 --> 00:09:08.900
In the event that that's
not quite enough pressure,

00:09:08.900 --> 00:09:10.000
although it seems
to work pretty well,

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:11.400
you can also sort
of roll it over

00:09:11.400 --> 00:09:12.500
as you press down.

00:09:12.500 --> 00:09:14.600
That keeps the seal even better.

00:09:14.700 --> 00:09:17.100
These handles are there
so that as I lift it up,

00:09:17.400 --> 00:09:18.200
I can hold it open.

00:09:18.200 --> 00:09:21.300
That way, it doesn't draw the heat
back up through the pipe

00:09:21.300 --> 00:09:22.172
into the Bellows.

00:09:22.172 --> 00:09:23.652
It'd fill it up with ash,
and it would burn.

00:09:24.102 --> 00:09:25.600
It just takes in
air from the top.

00:09:25.600 --> 00:09:28.000
So you lift,
close, and squeeze,

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:30.600
and it just blows a whole bunch
of air right out.

00:09:30.600 --> 00:09:31.600
This piece of PVC

00:09:31.600 --> 00:09:34.540
is just fit into a hole
that I left at the bottom.

00:09:34.540 --> 00:09:37.800
I then wrapped a lot
of this sinew down around it.

00:09:37.800 --> 00:09:39.200
It's in there
pretty nice and tight.

00:09:39.200 --> 00:09:40.482
Holds onto the bag,

00:09:41.382 --> 00:09:45.182
and this size PVC just
happens to be the right size.

00:09:46.172 --> 00:09:47.400
We might we might be able

00:09:47.400 --> 00:09:49.300
to get some marshmallows
shooting out of this.

00:09:49.700 --> 00:09:50.900
Let's give this a try.

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:51.700
I'm going to see

00:09:51.700 --> 00:09:53.780
if I can shoot a marshmallow
into Joe's mouth.

00:09:58.300 --> 00:09:59.420
&gt;&gt; Wow!

00:10:00.240 --> 00:10:02.060
&gt;&gt; Slow motion replay.

00:10:02.060 --> 00:10:09.140
[Music]

00:10:09.300 --> 00:10:10.900
&gt;&gt; All right, update time.

00:10:10.900 --> 00:10:13.700
We've got two
completed Bellows bags.

00:10:13.900 --> 00:10:14.772
How's yours working?

00:10:14.772 --> 00:10:16.012
&gt;&gt; It's functional.

00:10:16.142 --> 00:10:16.792
&gt;&gt; Very cool.

00:10:16.800 --> 00:10:17.600
You're using bamboo.

00:10:17.600 --> 00:10:19.800
So, more realistic in terms

00:10:19.800 --> 00:10:21.600
of things you might find
in the wilderness.

00:10:21.800 --> 00:10:25.100
Although, it's kind of depends
on what wilderness you have.

00:10:25.460 --> 00:10:28.400
But there's lots of different ways
you can get a pipe shape thing.

00:10:28.600 --> 00:10:29.900
My way is PVC,

00:10:29.900 --> 00:10:33.012
which grows on the PVC trees,
of course.

00:10:33.462 --> 00:10:33.900
Very cool.

00:10:33.900 --> 00:10:36.100
So now, I think the next step is
to test these out

00:10:36.100 --> 00:10:38.000
with actual fire.

00:10:38.200 --> 00:10:39.100
&gt;&gt; I think that's the next thing.

00:10:39.100 --> 00:10:41.922
And we are going
to be doing an iron smelt.

00:10:41.922 --> 00:10:44.800
We're going to be taking iron
ore running through the furnace,

00:10:44.800 --> 00:10:47.352
and trying to extract
the iron out of that ore.

00:10:47.642 --> 00:10:49.800
And these what we're going
to use to keep that fire

00:10:49.800 --> 00:10:52.600
hot enough for hours
and hours on end.

00:10:53.100 --> 00:10:54.700
So let's take these out

00:10:54.700 --> 00:10:57.962
and test them out in an iron smelt.
&gt;&gt; Yeah, let's do it.

00:10:58.582 --> 00:10:59.700
Our bags are made,

00:10:59.700 --> 00:11:02.300
and we've switched
out the bamboo and PVC

00:11:02.300 --> 00:11:06.100
that we had before for this cool
little bamboo forked shape.

00:11:06.100 --> 00:11:07.800
That way we can have
both of the bags going

00:11:07.800 --> 00:11:09.400
into one spot in the furnace.

00:11:09.772 --> 00:11:12.200
This stake is here to keep it
from sliding out backwards.

00:11:12.200 --> 00:11:14.700
So it always keeps directing
the are right where we want it.

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:16.700
So Joseph tell us
about our little furnace here.

00:11:16.700 --> 00:11:19.600
&gt;&gt; So this furnace is called
a bloomery stack furnace,

00:11:19.600 --> 00:11:24.000
and the purpose of it is
to transform rock, into metal.

00:11:24.322 --> 00:11:25.800
Well, what we're going
to be doing is stuffing

00:11:25.800 --> 00:11:26.600
it full of charcoal,

00:11:26.600 --> 00:11:29.520
and then layering it
with charcoal and ore,

00:11:29.580 --> 00:11:32.200
and ore is just a stone
that contains basically rust.

00:11:32.200 --> 00:11:36.900
And so as those burn down
to the level of the air,

00:11:36.900 --> 00:11:40.800
they're going to slowly
transform chemically into iron,

00:11:40.800 --> 00:11:42.100
and then collect in the bottom,

00:11:42.100 --> 00:11:44.200
and then we're going
to collect a big lump of it,

00:11:44.200 --> 00:11:45.300
which is called a bloom.

00:11:45.500 --> 00:11:46.900
Hence, why this
is called a bloomery.

00:11:46.900 --> 00:11:48.300
&gt;&gt; So we've got our bags,

00:11:48.300 --> 00:11:50.500
and I think we can do
a nice demonstration.

00:11:50.500 --> 00:11:52.100
We've already got
stuff burning in here.

00:11:52.100 --> 00:11:54.300
You can see just a thick
white smoke coming out of it.

00:11:54.600 --> 00:11:56.602
Probably half of that
is steam as well.

00:11:57.092 --> 00:12:01.000
But what we can do now is we
can pump with our Bellows,

00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:01.700
and we'll watch

00:12:01.700 --> 00:12:03.500
as this just gets
hotter and hotter,

00:12:03.500 --> 00:12:05.700
and I think pretty quickly,
will start having flames coming

00:12:05.700 --> 00:12:07.132
out of the top instead of smoke.

00:12:07.140 --> 00:12:35.320
[Music]

00:12:35.320 --> 00:12:36.180
Look at that.

00:12:36.282 --> 00:12:38.102
Blazing flames coming
out the top.

00:12:38.102 --> 00:12:45.840
[Music]

00:12:45.840 --> 00:12:46.800
Now, we've basically

00:12:46.800 --> 00:12:49.462
just smothered all
that hot fire we got.

00:12:50.692 --> 00:12:52.832
Smoke is thick as
any smoke bomb we've ever made.

00:12:54.282 --> 00:12:56.192
Our bag bellows are up
and running there.

00:12:56.342 --> 00:12:58.200
Focusing a lot
of concentrated air

00:12:58.200 --> 00:12:59.600
into our bloom furnace.

00:12:59.600 --> 00:13:00.200
Very cool.

00:13:00.200 --> 00:13:03.400
&gt;&gt; So Joseph, the next step is to actually
try and extract iron ore, right?

00:13:03.412 --> 00:13:05.500
&gt;&gt; Yes, and for that,
we need iron ore.

00:13:05.700 --> 00:13:06.100
All right,

00:13:06.100 --> 00:13:09.900
our next video we do with Joseph
is going to be extracting iron

00:13:09.900 --> 00:13:12.100
from Iron Ore using
our Bloom furnace

00:13:12.100 --> 00:13:12.900
and the Bellows.

00:13:12.900 --> 00:13:14.222
Look for that coming soon.

00:13:15.452 --> 00:13:16.300
Guys, that's it for today.

00:13:16.300 --> 00:13:17.600
But we've always got more
for you to see.

00:13:17.600 --> 00:13:19.600
That box up at the top
will transport you directly

00:13:19.600 --> 00:13:20.332
to our last video,

00:13:20.332 --> 00:13:21.200
and you should go
check that out.

00:13:21.600 --> 00:13:22.500
The other box will show you

00:13:22.500 --> 00:13:24.100
what YouTube thinks you
should be watching next,

00:13:24.100 --> 00:13:26.400
and if you're not a subscriber
yet, just hit this bomb to get in the club,

00:13:26.400 --> 00:13:27.940
and that way you
never miss out on the fun.

00:13:27.940 --> 00:13:29.100
Don't forget to ring the bell,

00:13:29.100 --> 00:13:30.100
and we will see you
in the next one.

00:13:30.300 --> 00:13:30.800
Talk to you then.
