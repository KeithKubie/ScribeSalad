KSENIIA SHUMELCHYK:
Hello, my name is Kseniia.

00:00:06.090 --> 00:00:09.590
I am a bioengineer and Google
developer expert for Android.

00:00:09.590 --> 00:00:10.420
I am from Ukraine.

00:00:10.420 --> 00:00:13.660
Dnipro is my hometown where
I grew up and studied.

00:00:13.660 --> 00:00:15.850
I have started learning
programming with my elder

00:00:15.850 --> 00:00:18.070
brother 15 years ago.

00:00:18.070 --> 00:00:21.760
Internet was not common,
so I took paper notes.

00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:24.580
My career started with the
Google Summer of Code program,

00:00:24.580 --> 00:00:26.230
where I have met
other participants

00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:29.260
from Ukraine and local Google
developer group community.

00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:32.950
In 2015, I was selected as
Google Anita Borg scholar.

00:00:32.950 --> 00:00:35.330
And that was a
turning point for me.

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:38.790
Since this program, I met
a lot of outstanding women

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:42.520
who became friends, colleagues,
and role models for me.

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:44.795
Personal connections are
the greatest resources

00:00:44.795 --> 00:00:47.650
you could have at I/O. And
together with open mind,

00:00:47.650 --> 00:00:50.650
it can lead to new,
innovative ideas.

00:00:50.650 --> 00:00:53.280
Me and my little Droids
will be glad to see you

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:54.560
at Google I/O 2018.
