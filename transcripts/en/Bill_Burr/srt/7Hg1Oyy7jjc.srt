1
00:00:02,360 --> 00:00:05,540
Hey, what's going on? It's Bill Burr.
It's time for the Thursday afternoon.

2
00:00:05,541 --> 00:00:09,910
Just before Friday.
Monday morning podcast and ah ha ha ha.

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:11,150
I'm checking in on you.

4
00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:12,990
Youuu.

5
00:00:15,060 --> 00:00:18,370
Oh, sorry. Uh, how are Ya? Um, and

6
00:00:20,170 --> 00:00:23,560
Health Helsinki. I'm in Helsinki. I got a,

7
00:00:23,561 --> 00:00:25,300
I just did Stockholm the other night.

8
00:00:25,301 --> 00:00:30,301
I did Copenhagen two shows the night
before and fucking Iceland on Monday.

9
00:00:31,380 --> 00:00:33,010
Been having a great
time. Joe Barton. Nick.

10
00:00:34,270 --> 00:00:34,850
Yeah.

11
00:00:34,850 --> 00:00:37,850
Comment over here. Like he's always
been over here. I actually asked him,

12
00:00:37,890 --> 00:00:42,390
cause he's been crushing so hard
and so not like in his head,

13
00:00:43,170 --> 00:00:47,280
you know, about being over here thinking
of, I'm going to do a joke about ducks.

14
00:00:47,281 --> 00:00:50,220
Do they have ducks?
Do I need to say Canard?

15
00:00:51,300 --> 00:00:54,540
He hasn't been doing any of that
shit. And, um, he's been killing.

16
00:00:54,541 --> 00:00:59,400
So I asked him last night when
we were in Stockholm. I was like,

17
00:01:00,030 --> 00:01:04,790
how many times you've been over here?
And he goes, Europe, that's fight.

18
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:07,230
Yeah. And he goes, never.

19
00:01:08,700 --> 00:01:11,580
That's why people love Joe Barton,
Nick,

20
00:01:11,581 --> 00:01:16,490
because Joey B is Joey be
no matter where he is. Um,

21
00:01:16,740 --> 00:01:18,570
yeah, he's been killing and I've been, uh,

22
00:01:19,230 --> 00:01:22,440
I've been having some good sets
over here trying out the new shit,

23
00:01:22,620 --> 00:01:23,453
the race against him.

24
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:28,100
Time, you know, I heard Joe Rogan
say the other day that he was,

25
00:01:28,380 --> 00:01:31,310
he put in six months of work and he's
got a new hour that he's happy with,

26
00:01:31,311 --> 00:01:34,370
you know,
cause this special came out and um,

27
00:01:35,440 --> 00:01:35,840
yeah,

28
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:38,030
you know, I was, I don't know, I just get,

29
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:42,520
I get like amped up when I hear
shit like that, but uh, so I'm,

30
00:01:42,521 --> 00:01:46,290
I'm trying not to jump the gun.
If you guys are you,

31
00:01:46,430 --> 00:01:47,840
if you want to hear my process,

32
00:01:47,870 --> 00:01:52,870
my process about building a new hour is
I usually dump this shit on most sick of

33
00:01:54,170 --> 00:01:57,950
first. You know what I mean?
And a, it's a weird time.

34
00:01:57,951 --> 00:02:01,940
It's a weird time for your act because
what happens is you get really excited

35
00:02:01,941 --> 00:02:02,460
about the new stuff

36
00:02:02,460 --> 00:02:05,850
stuff and then the old stuff still
works and nobody's really seen it yet,

37
00:02:07,310 --> 00:02:09,260
but you, you, you know,
you're getting rid of it.

38
00:02:09,261 --> 00:02:12,130
So you feel like you ever
go on a date with somebody,

39
00:02:12,870 --> 00:02:14,100
you know.
And you know,

40
00:02:14,101 --> 00:02:17,930
you're going to break up with
them and you're out to dinner and,

41
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,630
and she's just like, you want dessert?
You're like, no, no, let's wrap this up.

42
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:30,210
Um, that's how, that's, that's what
you have to fight with your jokes.

43
00:02:30,450 --> 00:02:34,590
Like you start trying to wrap them up
and then jokes that were funny or now not

44
00:02:34,591 --> 00:02:37,560
funny because you're trying
to rush through them. So, um,

45
00:02:37,620 --> 00:02:40,770
I kind of figured that out the
last couple of nights and, uh,

46
00:02:40,860 --> 00:02:44,280
had some great shows and, um, I dunno,

47
00:02:44,310 --> 00:02:47,250
I did stock home last night and some
of this stuff people said to me on the

48
00:02:47,251 --> 00:02:51,840
stage was making me a little
nervous where I was like,

49
00:02:52,410 --> 00:02:56,710
uh, you know, I said something, I'm
not a big political guy, but, uh,

50
00:02:57,370 --> 00:03:01,990
I've been doing this joke over
here where I just go, um, you know,

51
00:03:02,290 --> 00:03:04,180
and as you all know in America right now,

52
00:03:04,181 --> 00:03:07,430
we currently have our greatest
president of all time. You know,

53
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:10,450
and people usually laugh because
generally speaking they don't like him.

54
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:15,610
And it was sort of quiet. It's, there was
a couple people who just went like, yeah,

55
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:16,593
Woo.

56
00:03:17,350 --> 00:03:21,280
It's just like really and hung out with
some people afterwards and they will

57
00:03:21,281 --> 00:03:24,820
kind of say in that, uh Oh and I
mentioned, I mentioned during the show,

58
00:03:24,821 --> 00:03:28,210
I was saying this is nothing
against people from Stockholm
that just let me know

59
00:03:28,211 --> 00:03:31,960
where people are kind of ad.
And then it was saying

60
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:36,690
I go, can I ask you a question?
I go, is this bullshit?

61
00:03:36,950 --> 00:03:38,380
Gonna start up again over here.

62
00:03:39,580 --> 00:03:43,690
And they kind of got a little
uncomfortable like and kind of said, yeah,

63
00:03:43,750 --> 00:03:47,680
I don't know if they were joking or what
the bullshit meaning another world war.

64
00:03:49,550 --> 00:03:50,383
MMM.

65
00:03:50,930 --> 00:03:51,741
I Dunno.
It's weird.

66
00:03:51,741 --> 00:03:54,650
And then I kind of talked to some people
afterwards and granted Allie talked to

67
00:03:54,651 --> 00:03:56,690
two people and it was their opinion,

68
00:03:56,691 --> 00:04:01,580
but they was saying that it's just kind
of getting like racist or whatever.

69
00:04:02,450 --> 00:04:05,210
Not like it ever went away. I
Dunno. People are fucking awful.

70
00:04:05,211 --> 00:04:07,760
But those two people I talked to
a nice and you know, something,

71
00:04:09,320 --> 00:04:12,500
90% of the fucking people
that I talked to, one nice

72
00:04:14,250 --> 00:04:18,630
and you know, the rest are like racist
or like hardcore feminists, you know,

73
00:04:18,631 --> 00:04:21,330
just people you can't even have
a fucking conversation with.

74
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:24,393
MMM.

75
00:04:24,750 --> 00:04:28,950
Sounding really ignorant to walk through
the fucking world thinking that you

76
00:04:28,951 --> 00:04:31,980
have all the answers and you're
going to be the one that solves it.

77
00:04:32,790 --> 00:04:35,820
How long have people been on this
planet? I Dunno. When did Jesus die?

78
00:04:35,970 --> 00:04:40,560
Fucking 2020 years ago. Then you
had what, like 500 years before him?

79
00:04:40,620 --> 00:04:41,610
Is that what it was? I, you know,

80
00:04:41,620 --> 00:04:45,390
I have no idea how long people have
been on this planet. Hang on a second.

81
00:04:45,391 --> 00:04:50,190
Let me look that up.
How long have people,

82
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:55,940
it'd be funny just to leave it there
to see what they suggest that I said,

83
00:04:55,941 --> 00:04:58,470
search here. How long
have people, no suggestion

84
00:05:00,060 --> 00:05:03,420
then I can't say here. Right. That's
even, that's even too stupid for Google.

85
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:07,770
How long have people been on,
on the earth?

86
00:05:08,230 --> 00:05:12,360
This'll take me to Scientology. Well,
before we were in a spaceship. Um,

87
00:05:13,860 --> 00:05:18,390
how long have people been on earth?
Do you imagine if Scientology is right?

88
00:05:18,391 --> 00:05:19,740
There was some spaceship,
right?

89
00:05:19,741 --> 00:05:24,741
And then they just fucking dropped us
down here with absolutely no fucking what

90
00:05:24,781 --> 00:05:27,870
I mean, how far, how far in advance
would they be technologically?

91
00:05:29,350 --> 00:05:30,183
Right.

92
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:32,600
Anybody?
Can you hear me here?

93
00:05:33,470 --> 00:05:35,900
And then they just fucking leave
you to start all over again.

94
00:05:35,901 --> 00:05:40,790
And then that would basically be the,
this would be a global like survivor,

95
00:05:41,750 --> 00:05:44,240
like this big fucking reality
show that they're watching.

96
00:05:46,100 --> 00:05:46,870
MMM.

97
00:05:46,870 --> 00:05:49,180
Here's a question and he's signed
to ologists listen to this.

98
00:05:49,660 --> 00:05:51,280
Here's my question that goes,

99
00:05:53,950 --> 00:05:57,000
how this reminds me of this Joe
Rogan bit he used to do about Noah's,

100
00:05:57,860 --> 00:06:00,620
where he was talking about how many
species of plant or on the planet,

101
00:06:00,621 --> 00:06:03,800
and if he had two of each, and he was
like, how big is this fucking boat?

102
00:06:04,310 --> 00:06:06,230
Doesn't that kind of
work with Scientology?

103
00:06:06,710 --> 00:06:10,460
Like do you guys have a finite number
of members that you can have and at that

104
00:06:10,461 --> 00:06:10,761
point,

105
00:06:10,761 --> 00:06:13,580
like the spaceships not going to be
big enough or is it going to be a whole

106
00:06:13,581 --> 00:06:16,940
fleet?
I Dunno.

107
00:06:18,320 --> 00:06:22,520
I Dunno why that religion has been
interesting meeting. Interesting me.

108
00:06:22,610 --> 00:06:26,540
Interesting. I think right there. I
just got Gab. We don't need this guy.

109
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:32,120
All right. How have, how long
have humans been on earth?

110
00:06:33,110 --> 00:06:35,480
Why can't they just answer the question?

111
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:39,380
This is what I fucking hate about smart
people. They got to go on and on and on.

112
00:06:39,381 --> 00:06:44,030
It starts up while our ancestors have
been around for about 6 million years,

113
00:06:45,700 --> 00:06:49,940
just give me a number.
What am I buying a fucking car here?

114
00:06:50,320 --> 00:06:51,153
Yeah.

115
00:06:52,060 --> 00:06:55,030
While our ancestors had been
around for about 6 million years,

116
00:06:55,031 --> 00:06:59,290
the modern form of humans only
evolved about 200,000 years ago.

117
00:07:00,760 --> 00:07:03,440
Yeah. Weren't they like two
different kinds? And one of them, uh,

118
00:07:04,010 --> 00:07:06,370
live than the other ones. Didn't.
There's somebody beat somebody else.

119
00:07:06,910 --> 00:07:11,560
I don't know. The only part I don't think
I know about that history is a movies,

120
00:07:11,620 --> 00:07:14,470
not even documentaries.
That's how not read. I am.

121
00:07:14,590 --> 00:07:18,370
I don't even watch documentaries.
A civilization as we know it.

122
00:07:20,290 --> 00:07:24,730
It's only about 6,000 years old. So
what does that mean? Running water?

123
00:07:25,420 --> 00:07:26,800
That goes back to Roman times.

124
00:07:28,310 --> 00:07:31,340
They held the title for 4,000
years before they whacked Jesus.

125
00:07:31,341 --> 00:07:33,200
Was that their downfall?
They killed Jesus.

126
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:37,400
Is that what happened or do they
stretch it out too far like Hitler?

127
00:07:37,970 --> 00:07:39,560
Did they fight a war on two fronts?
I mean,

128
00:07:39,670 --> 00:07:42,500
I'll just fucking melts together
after a while, doesn't it?

129
00:07:43,450 --> 00:07:46,880
All right about 6,000 years old and
industrialization started in the,

130
00:07:47,270 --> 00:07:50,000
in earnest only in the
18 hundreds. Ah, Jesus.

131
00:07:51,330 --> 00:07:52,070
Yeah.

132
00:07:52,070 --> 00:07:53,720
Future generations are paying for that.

133
00:07:53,721 --> 00:07:55,790
But I'll tell you what a
fucking life we're living

134
00:07:57,400 --> 00:08:01,490
flat screen TVs and fucking cell phones.
Speaking of cell phones.

135
00:08:01,640 --> 00:08:04,910
Helsinki.
I'm in Helsinki.

136
00:08:04,911 --> 00:08:07,610
This is where no Kia started angry birds.

137
00:08:08,840 --> 00:08:11,570
What else are they known for here?
Hockey.

138
00:08:12,740 --> 00:08:13,573
Yeah.

139
00:08:14,340 --> 00:08:17,340
Valtteri Botox. Huh? Who fucking
one? I got, I got to see that race.

140
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:22,190
It's just going to be like the
first year I watched when, uh, uh,

141
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:26,970
Lewis Hamilton went up against the
other guy there that Lily Ricky Schroder

142
00:08:26,971 --> 00:08:29,940
looking dude,
Nico Rosberg

143
00:08:31,710 --> 00:08:36,610
and he fucking won beat Louis Hamilton.
And then his girlfriend was like,

144
00:08:36,611 --> 00:08:39,190
I don't want you to do it anymore.
And he was like, all right.

145
00:08:40,040 --> 00:08:40,873
Oh.

146
00:08:41,940 --> 00:08:44,100
Um, I don't think that's what happened
because he's still stayed away.

147
00:08:44,101 --> 00:08:45,240
At some point he would have dumped her.

148
00:08:45,770 --> 00:08:48,330
He would have missed the sound
of the engine. Right. All right.

149
00:08:48,331 --> 00:08:52,830
So I guess we've been around for 6,000
years as we know it 200,000 years ago.

150
00:08:52,831 --> 00:08:53,970
The first fucking humans.

151
00:08:54,770 --> 00:08:55,603
Yeah.

152
00:08:55,970 --> 00:09:00,170
I'll tell you what's fucking amazing
about all of this is I have no idea why he

153
00:09:00,350 --> 00:09:05,060
fucking looked this up. I Dunno. Can you,

154
00:09:05,061 --> 00:09:06,730
can it really be this,
this is my new thing,

155
00:09:06,731 --> 00:09:10,360
how I deal with my short term memory when
I can't remember stuff. I just think,

156
00:09:10,460 --> 00:09:15,300
well, you know, if I can't remember
it, was it really that important? Um,

157
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:19,020
anyway, plowing ahead here.
Uh, here's a great story.

158
00:09:19,860 --> 00:09:22,680
It's not a great story. It
kind of itself. All right.

159
00:09:24,900 --> 00:09:29,220
Oh Wow. Why did they do that? Shit. We're
going to make you watch this fucking ad.

160
00:09:29,221 --> 00:09:31,800
I don't want to watch
it close the fucking ad.

161
00:09:34,350 --> 00:09:37,170
I'm going to hit mute because they don't
get paid. Is that what the fuck it is?

162
00:09:37,650 --> 00:09:40,140
Stop. Stop. Thank you. All right. Uh,

163
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:45,680
venture fans brutally beat man outside
cinema after he loudly revealed the

164
00:09:46,741 --> 00:09:49,920
surprise ending to the
blockbuster end game movie.

165
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:58,470
I love both sides of this story.
I mean,

166
00:09:58,471 --> 00:10:01,920
that is just the ultimate conti
thing to do with. So fucking funny.

167
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:03,750
And then I got to admit,

168
00:10:04,770 --> 00:10:08,190
you have to respect how much people
care about this franchise and if you're

169
00:10:08,191 --> 00:10:09,900
going to do something like that,
I mean,

170
00:10:09,901 --> 00:10:14,190
he kinda got the ass kick
and he deserved, right? Uh,

171
00:10:15,270 --> 00:10:18,030
thank God it was a mob and
nerds who repeat fucking dead.

172
00:10:19,310 --> 00:10:21,930
Do you realize what you have to do?
I mean,

173
00:10:21,931 --> 00:10:25,260
nerds is supposed to be these nonviolent
people who just kind of sit around and

174
00:10:25,261 --> 00:10:26,430
be awkward all the time.

175
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:29,820
I love that they fucking tapped
into their inner chuck Norris.

176
00:10:30,810 --> 00:10:32,190
You found the breaking point.

177
00:10:32,191 --> 00:10:37,050
You go in and you fuck with their
superhero franchise. Look at them.

178
00:10:37,051 --> 00:10:40,770
They turn into their cavemen selves
from 200,000 years ago. Look at me.

179
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:44,790
Sounded smart all of a sudden. Um, I mean,

180
00:10:44,791 --> 00:10:49,200
they surpassed modern civilization as
we've known it for the last 6,000 years

181
00:10:49,201 --> 00:10:53,130
and went back to our earliest ancestors
at 2000 years. Listen to that, huh?

182
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:58,800
The beginning of a Dennis Miller joke.
I think I'm smart now. I'm a man,

183
00:10:58,920 --> 00:11:00,810
has reportedly been beaten outside,

184
00:11:01,140 --> 00:11:06,140
beaten up outside his cinema after
loudly revealing the plot of the new

185
00:11:07,260 --> 00:11:11,130
adventure film to queuing fans. Q, u,

186
00:11:11,131 --> 00:11:15,750
e you ing. There you go. There goes all
my dentist melanoma dummy again, uh,

187
00:11:15,780 --> 00:11:18,990
film queuing to queuing
fans who hadn't seen it yet.

188
00:11:18,991 --> 00:11:23,950
So he walked out of a showing and they
were all standing in line and he went,

189
00:11:24,030 --> 00:11:27,620
the hulk is green because he has
gunnery, ours, whatever the fucking,

190
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:32,520
whatever the fuck he yelled up because
they're all banging wonder woman.

191
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:35,970
Is this even the right franchise?
Um,

192
00:11:35,971 --> 00:11:39,360
someone was trying to tell me that
they've made 23 of these movies,

193
00:11:40,770 --> 00:11:45,030
23 of these fucking movies,
just,

194
00:11:45,031 --> 00:11:49,080
just for all you other people who
just watch sports, like make, um,

195
00:11:49,740 --> 00:11:54,740
just to give you a motive for how this
guy turned a pack of fucking awkward

196
00:11:56,611 --> 00:11:58,440
nerds.
So you could probably walk up,

197
00:11:58,450 --> 00:12:01,710
slap him in the head and take their
fucking popcorn and they wouldn't do

198
00:12:01,711 --> 00:12:03,960
anything as long as they
held onto their movie ticket.

199
00:12:04,140 --> 00:12:07,350
This guy found out what it was.

200
00:12:08,460 --> 00:12:09,293
Yeah.

201
00:12:09,380 --> 00:12:11,210
It reminded me of a long time ago,

202
00:12:11,211 --> 00:12:14,060
this guy ran for president that I
voted for and I can't even remember his

203
00:12:14,061 --> 00:12:14,894
fucking name.

204
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:17,713
MMM.

205
00:12:17,720 --> 00:12:21,500
He was the guy that everybody blamed for
the first George Bush for getting in.

206
00:12:22,920 --> 00:12:23,400
You know,

207
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:26,460
cause everybody made the assumption that
if you voted for this guy than there,

208
00:12:26,490 --> 00:12:30,120
than if you didn't vote for that guy,
you would have voted for fucking Al Gore.

209
00:12:31,980 --> 00:12:32,813
MMM.

210
00:12:33,450 --> 00:12:37,190
Forgetting the fact of how fucking
horrific Al Gore was all fucking sweaty.

211
00:12:39,150 --> 00:12:41,850
Al, you didn't laugh enough in
the last debate. You didn't smile.

212
00:12:41,860 --> 00:12:45,840
Then also was just like Ho, Ho, Ho,
Ho, Ho looking like a fucking robot.

213
00:12:47,190 --> 00:12:51,310
Um, let me see. Well, looking
back, that was a fucking era.

214
00:12:51,880 --> 00:12:54,340
We should, you know, I didn't give
a fuck if you're conservative.

215
00:12:54,341 --> 00:12:56,860
I think we should've Gone Al Gore,
you know,

216
00:12:57,700 --> 00:13:01,330
then maybe we don't go to Iraq and become
bankrupt and have to give champions of

217
00:13:01,331 --> 00:13:03,760
sports fast food when they
show up at the White House.

218
00:13:04,820 --> 00:13:06,850
I'll probably oversimplifying all of this,
but you know,

219
00:13:07,630 --> 00:13:10,060
I'm a man who just learned how long
you've been on this planet. So why,

220
00:13:10,061 --> 00:13:11,470
why are you listening to me?

221
00:13:14,610 --> 00:13:15,750
MMM [inaudible]

222
00:13:16,460 --> 00:13:18,540
all right. What the fuck am
I talking about here? Yeah.

223
00:13:18,541 --> 00:13:20,190
So this guy found the fuck it's anybody's,

224
00:13:20,340 --> 00:13:22,860
he's been made 23 of these fucking movies.

225
00:13:23,160 --> 00:13:27,120
So let's just say the
average movie is 90 minutes.

226
00:13:27,121 --> 00:13:29,370
Two hours long.
Okay.

227
00:13:29,371 --> 00:13:33,960
These poor people standing
in line had 46 hours

228
00:13:35,860 --> 00:13:37,600
invested into this wall.
Wait,

229
00:13:38,620 --> 00:13:38,850
yeah,

230
00:13:38,850 --> 00:13:42,960
we'll say 44 hours plus the trap l
all the fucking money that they spent.

231
00:13:43,230 --> 00:13:45,030
And this was the final one.

232
00:13:47,050 --> 00:13:50,440
And that fucking asshole. I've,
I've, I wonder if he was even a fan

233
00:13:53,160 --> 00:13:56,160
if he just went in like this was
like some sort of like, I mean,

234
00:13:56,161 --> 00:13:59,250
that's like something opie and Anthony
would have come up with back in the day,

235
00:13:59,280 --> 00:14:01,220
like some brilliant
fucking thing like that.

236
00:14:03,270 --> 00:14:04,103
MMM.

237
00:14:05,380 --> 00:14:05,650
I don't know.

238
00:14:05,650 --> 00:14:08,170
This is one of these weird ones
where I kind of see both sides of it.

239
00:14:08,171 --> 00:14:12,460
Like what that kid did was fucking
hilarious and it was also horrific.

240
00:14:12,700 --> 00:14:15,520
Any deserved the ass kick.
And I'm on both sides of the fence here.

241
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:18,193
MMM.

242
00:14:18,930 --> 00:14:23,540
I would love to interview
this kid and ask.

243
00:14:23,541 --> 00:14:26,720
Just ask him, why did you do that?
Did you know you are going to do it?

244
00:14:26,721 --> 00:14:28,580
Do you have Tourette's or something?

245
00:14:28,581 --> 00:14:32,240
Like why the fuck did you do
that and what were you thinking

246
00:14:33,930 --> 00:14:36,960
when they started to attack you?
Do you regret doing it?

247
00:14:41,700 --> 00:14:42,533
MMM,

248
00:14:43,590 --> 00:14:47,850
I dunno. I mean, if I'm sitting on that
jury, I say that those fans had motive.

249
00:14:49,450 --> 00:14:52,560
I'm arguing. I mean, these
days, I mean, that's like,

250
00:14:52,680 --> 00:14:55,440
you got to think how young the
average fucking fan is of this.

251
00:14:58,350 --> 00:15:00,500
I mean, they invested half
their fucking lives into this.

252
00:15:00,510 --> 00:15:02,220
This guy just came in and told them what,

253
00:15:02,310 --> 00:15:05,490
I don't know what chimney Santa
Claus was coming down. I haven't,

254
00:15:05,500 --> 00:15:07,920
you know what I have no,
I don't know.

255
00:15:07,950 --> 00:15:11,160
There's so many of these fucking things
that people are telling you. You gotta.

256
00:15:11,190 --> 00:15:15,330
Why have you seen game of Thrones?
Have you seen fucking ah,

257
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:17,820
what is this one called the Avengers

258
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:22,200
and you just get so like
fucking hopelessly behind.

259
00:15:22,201 --> 00:15:27,180
It reminds me of my junior year in math
class. No, my senior year, junior year,

260
00:15:27,181 --> 00:15:31,290
I still tried. I tried until
October and it just gets to this,

261
00:15:31,320 --> 00:15:35,850
there's like a point where you're just
so far behind that you just give up hope.

262
00:15:36,540 --> 00:15:39,720
Like I'm not passing, I can't, I
what the eye, I'm just too far behind

263
00:15:41,340 --> 00:15:44,520
like a, I don't think I'll
ever see game of Thrones,

264
00:15:45,420 --> 00:15:49,890
which is a sad thing because I know
it's really good. I t you know,

265
00:15:51,150 --> 00:15:55,890
what is it like 19 fucking seasons
is something you've got to fucking,

266
00:15:56,240 --> 00:16:01,230
uh, I remember lost lost was the
first one that I was just like,

267
00:16:01,260 --> 00:16:05,010
I was too far behind and I
was just like, I, I'm not,

268
00:16:05,070 --> 00:16:06,360
I'm not fucking watching this.

269
00:16:07,020 --> 00:16:11,580
And then they fucked everybody
on the ending of that.

270
00:16:11,581 --> 00:16:15,150
So that one I feel good about.
Maybe that's the way you do it.

271
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:17,170
Yeah.

272
00:16:17,170 --> 00:16:22,170
What'd you do is you let other people
go on point and you let them watch the

273
00:16:22,401 --> 00:16:26,270
show for you and then they'll
report back to you like, oh my God,

274
00:16:26,271 --> 00:16:29,780
that fucking ending sucked. What a waste
of fucking time. Then you go, all right,

275
00:16:29,930 --> 00:16:34,050
we'll fuck that then. Right?
All right, so avenger fence.

276
00:16:35,400 --> 00:16:39,420
Is it worth me?
MMM,

277
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:40,650
yeah.

278
00:16:40,650 --> 00:16:44,310
Sitting down
for 46 hours.

279
00:16:44,490 --> 00:16:49,370
That should literally be like a
fucking, you know, if anybody,

280
00:16:49,371 --> 00:16:53,720
you can stay awake for 46 straight hours
and watch all avenger movies right in a

281
00:16:53,721 --> 00:16:56,600
row.
The last person to fall asleep,

282
00:16:58,520 --> 00:17:02,250
the last person to fall asleep.
I don't know.

283
00:17:02,530 --> 00:17:07,320
When's the two big green hulk fists,
whatever the fuck you people are into. Ah,

284
00:17:07,350 --> 00:17:09,090
Shit.
Somebody just sent me a text.

285
00:17:09,091 --> 00:17:13,470
I was trying to think of the name of this
fucking comedian who I just doesn't do

286
00:17:13,471 --> 00:17:16,380
it anymore. It probably is into producing
or something like that. Whatever.

287
00:17:16,381 --> 00:17:17,700
What do either way,
I hope they happy.

288
00:17:17,710 --> 00:17:21,350
Just you have answers to somebody fucking
head. Their face pops into your head.

289
00:17:22,830 --> 00:17:25,110
You know when you're like,
what the fuck was that guy's name?

290
00:17:26,580 --> 00:17:29,040
I haven't seen him forever,
you know?

291
00:17:30,510 --> 00:17:30,680
Yeah.

292
00:17:30,680 --> 00:17:33,410
So then you can look them up on Facebook
and see what the fuck they're at

293
00:17:35,850 --> 00:17:38,520
and you see how much older they are and
then you realize that you look that much

294
00:17:38,521 --> 00:17:42,000
older than them and you don't recognize
any of the people that they're with.

295
00:17:42,001 --> 00:17:45,420
And it's like, did I ever even
fucking know that person? You know?

296
00:17:47,270 --> 00:17:49,070
Then you just start thinking like,
what is it all about?

297
00:17:49,080 --> 00:17:50,310
What the fuck am I doing out here?

298
00:17:51,630 --> 00:17:56,630
Is this what my life is going
to beautiful cities for 17 hours

299
00:17:59,560 --> 00:18:01,050
and getting on another plane and leaving.

300
00:18:06,100 --> 00:18:09,040
Then you look to see if they got a late
night menu and you start ordering bad

301
00:18:09,041 --> 00:18:13,090
food and you know, just
start spiraling down. Um, no,

302
00:18:14,860 --> 00:18:17,110
I've been doing, uh, I, I
didn't do well in Iceland.

303
00:18:17,140 --> 00:18:21,370
I was on vacation when I was
in Iceland and then I, uh, oh,

304
00:18:21,371 --> 00:18:25,570
Billy was getting the, was getting
the old belly coming back. But um,

305
00:18:26,230 --> 00:18:28,830
I dunno, I had a couple of fucking
moments there. I've always like,

306
00:18:28,831 --> 00:18:32,650
I don't like going fishing. I
like it, but then I don't like it.

307
00:18:32,651 --> 00:18:35,980
It's exciting and all of that.
But like, I just don't like,

308
00:18:36,190 --> 00:18:38,200
it's weird because I've eaten
so much fish in my life,

309
00:18:38,201 --> 00:18:41,620
but to actually fucking pull it out
of the sea, see how beautiful it is,

310
00:18:41,621 --> 00:18:44,110
and then fucking kill the thing,
you know?

311
00:18:45,290 --> 00:18:45,870
Yeah,

312
00:18:45,870 --> 00:18:49,200
man, I felt bad. I didn't even eat the
fucking head too. It's like Jesus Christ,

313
00:18:49,201 --> 00:18:51,390
Dude. What the fuck?
You know? I don't know.

314
00:18:51,420 --> 00:18:54,290
We through the rest of it into the
fucking ocean, but it bugged me. The cows,

315
00:18:54,350 --> 00:18:58,740
I never been. I know cows were that good
looking. So this is what I'm doing now.

316
00:18:58,800 --> 00:19:02,190
Because you know what's funny is I
know all you guys are cringing going,

317
00:19:02,220 --> 00:19:03,060
oh my God.

318
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:07,140
Is he going to start wearing Birkenstocks
and become an bill Bergen stocks?

319
00:19:07,170 --> 00:19:11,260
Right?
Hey,

320
00:19:11,450 --> 00:19:12,560
he's going to get a fucking,

321
00:19:13,370 --> 00:19:16,730
I'm going to scotch tape a man bun to
the back of my bald head and then I'm

322
00:19:16,860 --> 00:19:20,810
going to start preaching to you
guys about fucking being a Vegan.

323
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:26,070
Oh Dude, this is such a
fucked up analogy, man. Um,

324
00:19:26,220 --> 00:19:27,510
cause I gotta tell you something like,

325
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:32,400
you know how cruel they are to fucking
animals as a carnivore and you just don't

326
00:19:32,401 --> 00:19:35,220
want to watch it.
If you have any sort of heart,

327
00:19:35,221 --> 00:19:37,950
you just don't want to watch it
and you just fucking block it out.

328
00:19:38,280 --> 00:19:39,770
I saw this thing where they are this,

329
00:19:39,780 --> 00:19:42,950
there's some conservative talk show
hosts that got a fucking death threat.

330
00:19:42,951 --> 00:19:44,790
So I'm like, who the hell is this
guy? I don't know who this guy is.

331
00:19:44,791 --> 00:19:48,000
So I looked him up and he
did this fucking thing,

332
00:19:48,090 --> 00:19:49,910
some rant on like abortion

333
00:19:51,170 --> 00:19:53,660
and you know,

334
00:19:54,340 --> 00:19:59,110
he showed, I I saw like 0.5 seconds
he showed a picture of an abortion.

335
00:19:59,111 --> 00:20:01,330
I was just like, dude, what the fuck?

336
00:20:03,220 --> 00:20:04,053
MMM.

337
00:20:04,580 --> 00:20:08,360
You know, I'm not going to get involved
in my views on that thing. I, you know,

338
00:20:08,450 --> 00:20:10,690
whatever you want to do is
whatever you want to do. But uh,

339
00:20:10,700 --> 00:20:14,150
you might want to look at some photos.
Jesus fucking Christ.

340
00:20:14,270 --> 00:20:17,060
It's one of the worst
things I've ever seen. Um,

341
00:20:17,150 --> 00:20:19,900
I probably shouldn't have said that
because now his fans are going to say,

342
00:20:19,990 --> 00:20:21,590
I'm not going to get
involved in that shit.

343
00:20:21,591 --> 00:20:25,370
And I don't want to fucking
sit there cause I don't, I
don't know shit. All right,

344
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:28,850
so don't fuck, I'm not an ally of
either side of that fucking argument.

345
00:20:28,851 --> 00:20:33,230
I think it's your own fucking do whatever
the fuck you want to do. Okay. But yeah,

346
00:20:33,231 --> 00:20:37,780
you should probably look at a slide
show first. It's all I can say.

347
00:20:38,560 --> 00:20:42,010
Um, so I haven't said that. This
is what I'm going to do now. Um,

348
00:20:43,860 --> 00:20:48,620
I think when I'm on the road,
I'm going to be vegetarian for the fee.

349
00:20:48,680 --> 00:20:53,560
Like for breakfast I had eggs. Oh,
that's still vegetarian, right? No,

350
00:20:53,561 --> 00:20:57,670
that's a meet. I already
fucked it up. Whatever.

351
00:20:57,730 --> 00:21:02,290
I was going to be tried to
go veggie for the first, uh,

352
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:06,680
for breakfast and then for lunch and
then for dinner I'll have a laugh,

353
00:21:06,681 --> 00:21:10,960
something, you know, and
uh, I'll see how that goes.

354
00:21:10,961 --> 00:21:13,180
I've been doing that for the last
couple of days and it's good. I started,

355
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:17,050
I'm dropping, fucking wait. You
know, I'm not gonna lie to you.

356
00:21:17,051 --> 00:21:20,440
I'm shitting like a fucking race horse.
It's ridiculous.

357
00:21:20,441 --> 00:21:23,230
It's like I'm going to a bathroom,
like a fucking cocaine.

358
00:21:26,950 --> 00:21:29,160
People looking at me waiting
to snip. It's like, ah,

359
00:21:30,530 --> 00:21:35,320
you're looking at the wrong end. Damn.
Um, alright. Abortions, shit jokes.

360
00:21:35,620 --> 00:21:40,120
Dead Animals. Where else did we
go from here? World War three?

361
00:21:40,360 --> 00:21:43,420
I think we pretty much, I think it's
time for some advertising. All right,

362
00:21:43,421 --> 00:21:48,250
let's do it here. Um, what
do we got here? We got up.

363
00:21:48,270 --> 00:21:52,270
This is a long, long, hey look.
You know right in about that,

364
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:54,220
right in about fucking remember in faces,

365
00:21:54,221 --> 00:21:58,120
but forgetting the names and then you
remember him and then you'd go on Facebook

366
00:21:58,121 --> 00:22:01,840
and try to look them up and just see
where the, where the fuck they ended up.

367
00:22:02,440 --> 00:22:07,300
You know, whenever I do that, I just
said, I pray to God, they happy.

368
00:22:08,470 --> 00:22:11,440
I want to see joy. That's what I
want to see. You know, I'm not,

369
00:22:11,470 --> 00:22:16,330
I'm not as big a Qantas. Everybody
thinks I'm all right. Here we go.

370
00:22:18,010 --> 00:22:21,790
Where am I? Where am I? Where am I? Jesus.
Oh man, they want me to read all of this.

371
00:22:21,820 --> 00:22:25,420
Okay. Oh Jesus. What a how?

372
00:22:25,470 --> 00:22:28,780

just talking about butcher box,

butcher box.

374
00:22:30,940 --> 00:22:35,620
Is that ironic because of abortion talk
or is that ironic because of fucking

375
00:22:35,770 --> 00:22:40,330
veganism? Who knows you? You
make your choice. It's up to you.

separated Sherry's berries.

409
00:24:46,041 --> 00:24:50,330
Mother's Day is coming up and there's
absolutely nothing most of us wouldn't do

410
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:53,150

my mom.
I have to go into fucking detail.

416
00:25:11,621 --> 00:25:14,650
I always send her something nice.
They give her a great car and she smiles.

417
00:25:14,651 --> 00:25:17,620
She hugs me and tells me she loves
because she's mean. She's the best.

418
00:25:18,550 --> 00:25:23,230

that fucking movie dumped dads.

Smile. Well, ever day.

427
00:25:50,651 --> 00:25:54,950
I think she would like chocolate
chips the best I would think.

428
00:25:56,910 --> 00:26:00,270
I hope she would wait til she brushed
her teeth afterwards before she smiled.

429
00:26:00,360 --> 00:26:01,470
You know,

but not leastly quip.

445
00:26:56,760 --> 00:27:01,760
The new kids quip has the same two
minute timer and guiding pulses as our

446
00:27:01,891 --> 00:27:06,450
original version with no childish
gimmicks so they can brush.

447
00:27:06,451 --> 00:27:10,680
Just like a grownup. Motivate your
audience. Talk. Well, what the fuck is it?

448
00:27:11,360 --> 00:27:15,240
It's a toothbrush.
You know,

449
00:27:15,241 --> 00:27:17,310
I was never an electric toothbrush guy.
You got to do it.

450
00:27:17,311 --> 00:27:19,260
If you have the regular
ones that your gums,

451
00:27:19,261 --> 00:27:22,410
you brush your gums away is what happens.

452
00:27:22,411 --> 00:27:25,800
And then you get a perio
Donald fucking issue, right?

453
00:27:27,060 --> 00:27:29,460
And then you're going to get to
k and then your teeth fall out.

454
00:27:29,461 --> 00:27:31,200
Then you have stomach
problems and then you die.

455
00:27:31,201 --> 00:27:35,850
So I think you should get this
toothbrush. How was that? Quit a kids.

456
00:27:35,970 --> 00:27:39,240
The new brush is the same
as our original version.

457
00:27:39,241 --> 00:27:42,270
Just tweaked for size down mile.
Oh, they got them for kids.

458
00:27:42,271 --> 00:27:46,740
Now I'll have to get my daughter
one of these. Uh, you know,

459
00:27:46,741 --> 00:27:50,060
if you sent me a free one, maybe I could
talk a little more informed about it.

460
00:27:50,070 --> 00:27:51,270
Wink, wink, nudge, nudge.

461
00:27:51,590 --> 00:27:55,560
Their kids are inspired to brush better
and more often with oral care that looks

462
00:27:55,561 --> 00:27:59,550
and feels like the products the
adults in their life views and they,

463
00:27:59,670 --> 00:28:01,350
they're proud to use.
Quip,

464
00:28:02,160 --> 00:28:05,280
help them develop a grownup
routine without childish gimmicks.

465
00:28:05,450 --> 00:28:08,850
Kid friendly features like a
small brush head, watermelon,

466
00:28:10,350 --> 00:28:13,260
anticavity toothpaste and
rubber grip handles and colors.

467
00:28:13,261 --> 00:28:18,261
Little ones will love sensitive sonic
vibrations for an effective clean that

468
00:28:18,950 --> 00:28:21,210
gent that's gentle on your sensitive gums.

469
00:28:21,330 --> 00:28:26,330
Why people brush too hard and
some electric toothbrushes
are too abrasive built

470
00:28:26,791 --> 00:28:27,870
in two minute timer,

471
00:28:27,871 --> 00:28:31,980
pulses every 30 seconds to remind you
when to switch sides and help you to clean

472
00:28:31,981 --> 00:28:34,010
your whole mouth. That's why, uh,

473
00:28:34,080 --> 00:28:37,830
you should love quip and why over 1
million happy, healthy mouse do too.

474
00:28:37,831 --> 00:28:38,311
I'm telling you,
man,

475
00:28:38,311 --> 00:28:41,700
you get this thing and you floss and you
actually pay attention to the beeping

476
00:28:41,701 --> 00:28:42,690
and all that type of stuff.

477
00:28:42,691 --> 00:28:46,800
You're going to save yourself
an incredible amount of
headaches in your life.

You can have a beautiful smile.

479
00:28:48,570 --> 00:28:52,260
You're not going to get your teeth pulled
and I have to get a partial and all of

480
00:28:52,261 --> 00:28:55,560
that fucking crap and you
won't ruin your stomach, uh,

481
00:28:55,770 --> 00:28:58,140
cause you'll actually be able
to chew your food anyways.

beautiful. And that's it.

487
00:29:18,770 --> 00:29:22,410
And of all freckles, I'm going to, uh,

488
00:29:23,310 --> 00:29:26,730
this is what I'm going forward here
in Helsinki. I'm getting fresh,

489
00:29:26,760 --> 00:29:30,840
a fresh seasonal salad.
Then I'm getting a salmon soup.

490
00:29:30,841 --> 00:29:34,920
So what am I'm fucking trying,
I'm trying in, uh, any uh,

491
00:29:34,950 --> 00:29:38,640
vegetarians or vegans out there that,
you know,

492
00:29:38,770 --> 00:29:41,130
you got some good meals that I
can kind of toss it in there. I,

493
00:29:41,131 --> 00:29:44,470
I'd love to do it cause I'm feeling
pretty good. Feeling light on my,

494
00:29:44,560 --> 00:29:47,840
on my freckled toes here,
my freckled paste Ito's um,

495
00:29:47,980 --> 00:29:52,120
just don't give me any that Tofu shit.
All right.

496
00:29:52,150 --> 00:29:56,110
I don't like Tofu. I don't know what Tofu
is. I don't know what it's trying to be.

497
00:29:56,500 --> 00:29:59,470
And I also don't like that
shit where it's like, uh,

498
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:04,990
you know where they have like the fake
meat. Like I like a black bean burger,

499
00:30:05,230 --> 00:30:07,360
you know,
or if you make a lentil burgers,

500
00:30:08,020 --> 00:30:10,870
it's actually made from something I
don't like when they just mush a bunch of

501
00:30:10,871 --> 00:30:14,830
shit together and then try to make it
look like meat. It's just like, you know,

502
00:30:16,300 --> 00:30:18,490
it's like be yourself, you
know, be with the fuck you are.

503
00:30:19,030 --> 00:30:21,220
I have a great recipe for a, uh, uh,

504
00:30:21,280 --> 00:30:24,670
a lentil burger where it's also like,

505
00:30:25,300 --> 00:30:26,440
it's got beets in it,

506
00:30:27,820 --> 00:30:32,320
the is Cilantro and some other green shit
that you put in there and a little bit

507
00:30:32,321 --> 00:30:34,630
of bread crumbs.
It's fucking tremendous,

508
00:30:34,631 --> 00:30:36,670
but it's hard to eat that when
you're out here on the road.

509
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:38,860
That was the one thing I did
like about Iceland though,

510
00:30:40,090 --> 00:30:44,050
is as much as I didn't order anything like
that, they did have plenty of options.

511
00:30:44,051 --> 00:30:48,760
So anyways, um, I'll see how this goes.

512
00:30:49,930 --> 00:30:52,870
You know,
I think I'm always going to eat meat,

513
00:30:52,871 --> 00:30:56,680
but I think I'm going to do it like once
a day as opposed to like fucking three

514
00:30:56,681 --> 00:31:01,510
times a day. And um, part
of its cousin animals.

515
00:31:01,630 --> 00:31:04,540
I'll tell you what's weird about
pigs is UBC a little piglet.

516
00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:07,240
They're fucking adorable. And then
you think, I can't believe I eat that.

517
00:31:07,420 --> 00:31:10,420
But then you just see some fat pig
and it's just like Adam gave a fuck.

518
00:31:11,590 --> 00:31:15,490
Give it to behind. It's
pickier. Let's fuck it. Eat.

519
00:31:16,870 --> 00:31:20,230
Um, anyways. All right, that's it. Uh,

520
00:31:20,650 --> 00:31:22,540
thank you to everybody's been
coming out on this tour, man.

521
00:31:22,541 --> 00:31:27,541
I'm playing these fucking
really impressively sized
venues over here that have

522
00:31:29,051 --> 00:31:32,500
been absolutely beautiful and it blows
my mind that people are coming out here.

523
00:31:32,500 --> 00:31:35,350
So I do want to take the time
to say thank you for that.

524
00:31:35,770 --> 00:31:39,100
And I'm really looking forward.
I got two shows here tonight and uh,

525
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:43,870
in Helsinki and
then it's on to Oslo,

526
00:31:44,380 --> 00:31:45,250
Norway.

527
00:31:45,340 --> 00:31:50,340
And then I'm in Amsterdam and we got
the next day off and I'm in Amsterdam,

528
00:31:51,641 --> 00:31:55,900
although we are traveling to
Tel Aviv. But, uh, you know,

529
00:31:56,620 --> 00:31:59,860
that's going to be fun. Put it that
way, but I'm not drinking, you know,

530
00:31:59,920 --> 00:32:03,670
I think I'm going to eat like a pot cookie
or something like that and just walk

531
00:32:03,671 --> 00:32:07,540
around the just city, mildly tripping. Uh,

532
00:32:07,541 --> 00:32:11,410
I will not be getting on a bicycle, but
uh, yeah, that's what I'm going to do.

533
00:32:11,470 --> 00:32:15,280
I think that's what the fuck I'm gonna
do you no good. Clean Fun. All right.

534
00:32:15,281 --> 00:32:18,260
That's it. Enjoy your weekend,
your cons. Enjoy the music.

535
00:32:18,500 --> 00:32:22,320
And we've got another half hour of
the biggest hits Thursday afternoon,

536
00:32:22,321 --> 00:32:25,410
just before Friday,
Monday morning podcast from a year ago.

537
00:32:26,270 --> 00:32:30,160
[inaudible] I always forget how it does.
All right, let's see. I'm just somebody

538
00:33:15,560 --> 00:33:16,393
[inaudible] [inaudible]

539
00:33:17,160 --> 00:33:18,030
hey,
what's going on?

540
00:33:18,130 --> 00:33:21,090
It's bill burr and it's the
Monday morning podcast for Monday,

541
00:33:21,360 --> 00:33:25,080
May 2nd, 2011. Um,

542
00:33:25,650 --> 00:33:27,100
how the hell are you?
Um,

543
00:33:27,150 --> 00:33:31,650
this is a landmark week from
me in my career and, uh,

544
00:33:31,710 --> 00:33:34,940
and in this podcast because
for the first time ever,

545
00:33:36,650 --> 00:33:40,020
I'm actually, I have an
advertiser, no bullshit.

546
00:33:40,470 --> 00:33:41,790
I have an advertiser,

547
00:33:41,791 --> 00:33:46,650
like a real live radio show on this
podcast and I know what you guys are

548
00:33:46,651 --> 00:33:50,160
thinking, you're probably like, Oh gee,

549
00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:53,790
he's got advertising. So
what does that mean, Bill?

550
00:33:54,120 --> 00:33:59,070
Does that mean you're not going to
use the word content anymore? No,

551
00:33:59,071 --> 00:34:04,050
it does not. Does that mean you're
going to tone it down? No, it doesn't.

552
00:34:04,860 --> 00:34:08,430
All it means is that it continues
to be fucking free for you.

553
00:34:08,431 --> 00:34:10,530
Cheap motherfuckers. Not Kidding. A cheap,

554
00:34:11,550 --> 00:34:15,850
just a financially challenged
motherfuckers. You still mother fuckers,

555
00:34:16,090 --> 00:34:18,280
you're still fuckers of mothers.
But anyways,

556
00:34:18,281 --> 00:34:20,910
so this week for the
first time ever I do have,

557
00:34:20,911 --> 00:34:25,350
I'm going to have some advertising and
I'm actually working on some tee shirts

558
00:34:25,351 --> 00:34:27,960
and that type of thing. I'm trying
to take this thing to the next level.

559
00:34:28,590 --> 00:34:31,410
Maybe you have a merge page.
Whatever the hell I got to do a,

560
00:34:31,411 --> 00:34:36,330
I appreciate everybody who's gone on to
the [inaudible] podcast page and clicked

561
00:34:36,331 --> 00:34:41,040
on the donation button. Um, I
appreciate it. I really appreciate it.

562
00:34:41,041 --> 00:34:42,960
So with that, um, this week,

563
00:34:43,440 --> 00:34:46,910
my one and only advertised
to the first ever legends,

564
00:34:46,930 --> 00:34:50,420
one of these legendary moments in
the podcast. Like when I, when I,

565
00:34:50,421 --> 00:34:55,421
I switched from a yapping on my phone as
I drove down the street and I actually

566
00:34:56,250 --> 00:35:00,660
got a mixer. Um, this is the first
advertiser and you're probably thinking,

567
00:35:00,661 --> 00:35:03,060
hey bill, what are you going to do?
Are you going to advertise some booze?

568
00:35:03,061 --> 00:35:06,690
You can advertise some
weed. Uh, no I'm not.

569
00:35:07,290 --> 00:35:10,080
I'm actually going to give a lot of guys
out there. A little bit of a heads up.

570
00:35:10,081 --> 00:35:15,050
Mother's Day is coming up this
Sunday, isn't it? I Dunno,

571
00:35:15,090 --> 00:35:19,560
I didn't look it up. I think it is. See,

572
00:35:19,561 --> 00:35:22,680
this is what happens every mother's Day,
right? Who Doesn't love their mother?

573
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:25,110
Serial killers,
right?

574
00:35:26,910 --> 00:35:29,580
Syrah killers don't love their mothers.
Everybody else, you'll love your mother,

575
00:35:29,581 --> 00:35:32,040
right? But as much as you
try every year, what happens?

576
00:35:32,370 --> 00:35:35,970
Mother's Day sneaks up on you and all
of a sudden Saturday night you're out

577
00:35:35,971 --> 00:35:40,971
drinking a couple of couple of fucking
Pale Ales and all of a sudden somebody

578
00:35:41,161 --> 00:35:44,910
mentions it, you know the waitress with
their fucking cleavage, Chang and out.

579
00:35:44,911 --> 00:35:49,410
She'll mention, oh yeah, tomorrow. You
know, you're trying to pick her up a,

580
00:35:49,560 --> 00:35:52,230
what do you, what are you doing
tomorrow? And we should hang out,

581
00:35:52,231 --> 00:35:55,320
go play fucking horse shoes or some,
you know,

582
00:35:56,460 --> 00:36:00,090
my brother's got a cottage
up in New Hampshire, doe.

583
00:36:01,140 --> 00:36:04,230
She come up there and then
she's like, I can't, I am.

584
00:36:04,440 --> 00:36:08,910
I'm spending time with my mother's
tomorrow because it's mother's Day.

585
00:36:09,120 --> 00:36:12,660
And then what do you do? You Go, Oh fuck,
it's mother's Day. So what do you do?

586
00:36:12,810 --> 00:36:17,400
You run down to cvs, you
know, any port in a storm,

587
00:36:17,401 --> 00:36:20,550
you run down to the local drugstore and
you go and you try to find a fucking

588
00:36:20,551 --> 00:36:23,670
mother's Day card. But by the time you
get down there, there's only two left,

589
00:36:23,700 --> 00:36:28,230
right? What do you got?
There's the fucking one that
has like a fart joke on it.

590
00:36:28,530 --> 00:36:32,580
And then the one that's so affectionate,
it's borderline incestuous, right?

591
00:36:32,910 --> 00:36:34,560
So now what are you can
now you get a shitty car.

592
00:36:34,561 --> 00:36:36,360
The fucking envelopes are all creased up,

593
00:36:36,600 --> 00:36:40,260
delaying laying all over the fucking
place and your mother can see it.

594
00:36:40,261 --> 00:36:42,840
When you hand it to her, she could
see it. It's not a good card.

595
00:36:42,841 --> 00:36:44,110
It's just like you,
motherfucker.

596
00:36:44,130 --> 00:36:48,570
I carried you around in my fucking
home for nine months. I raised your,

597
00:36:49,020 --> 00:36:52,860
Brad asked the entire fucking life, and
this is what you do. You get me the, the,

598
00:36:52,861 --> 00:36:57,720
the, the goddamn leftover card
that nobody wanted at cvs.

599
00:36:58,500 --> 00:37:01,740
You couldn't even go to Walmart and
get me a shack at to go along with it.

600
00:37:02,370 --> 00:37:07,050
All right, well, I have the solution.

website, there's a microphone, right?

623
00:38:17,910 --> 00:38:22,110
When you go to pro flowers, uh, and you

let's get on with the podcast. All right.

635
00:39:06,911 --> 00:39:10,960
That was like old school. The hosts of
the show was doing it like in the 1950s,

636
00:39:11,770 --> 00:39:16,380
you know, this is the crest
toothpaste hour. Hello folks.

637
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:18,610
Say Your teeth falling out of your head.
Did you not notice?

638
00:39:18,611 --> 00:39:21,610
Because you've been in a mine for the
last 20 years and you don't belong to a

639
00:39:21,611 --> 00:39:24,040
union.
Thank God for crest.

640
00:39:24,370 --> 00:39:27,100
It's got fluoride soon to
be in your drinking water.

641
00:39:27,101 --> 00:39:30,340
So you're a lot more or less at days
lackadaisical or however you say the

642
00:39:30,341 --> 00:39:33,640
fucking word and you're less
likely to question authority.

643
00:39:35,530 --> 00:39:39,520
Um, I am in New York City people, uh, you
probably like, why bill, why are you in,

644
00:39:39,580 --> 00:39:43,860
in New York City? I'll tell you why.
Uh, me and Joe de Rosa and Robert Kelly,

645
00:39:43,861 --> 00:39:45,780
you heard last week we,
uh,

646
00:39:45,900 --> 00:39:50,310
our film debuted in the prestigious
Tribeca film festival and uh,

647
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:54,390
I went to two of the screenings. I'm
going to another screening tonight and uh,

648
00:39:54,391 --> 00:39:57,720
I gotta tell you something that is the
most nervous I've ever fucking been.

649
00:39:58,620 --> 00:40:03,090
I'd have to go back to the first time I
did Letterman or maybe the first time I

650
00:40:03,091 --> 00:40:06,960
even did stand up just the,
the feeling of,

651
00:40:07,020 --> 00:40:09,990
of like,
what if this goes bad?

652
00:40:09,990 --> 00:40:13,620
And I have absolutely no
control of it does. And uh,

653
00:40:13,621 --> 00:40:18,510
fortunately it went well and uh,
I got up tell you something.

654
00:40:18,511 --> 00:40:23,280
I don't say this too often. I was
really proud of, uh, I was proud of it.

655
00:40:23,730 --> 00:40:26,490
You know,
I knew we didn't pull any punches,

656
00:40:26,491 --> 00:40:30,270
but when I sought watching it with
the crowd was a whole different vibe.

657
00:40:30,510 --> 00:40:34,200
Plus watching it up against
some of the other movies. Um,

658
00:40:35,660 --> 00:40:38,220
you know, I was really nervous
cause their movies was, they were,

659
00:40:38,240 --> 00:40:42,210
they were great and some were really
serious and I was just going, oh my God,

660
00:40:43,130 --> 00:40:47,550
what the, how the hell is ours going to
hold up against in. Fortunately it did.

661
00:40:47,670 --> 00:40:48,330
And,
uh,

662
00:40:48,330 --> 00:40:52,200
we've had a great festival and tonight
is the last night and I gotta tell you

663
00:40:52,201 --> 00:40:52,561
people,

664
00:40:52,561 --> 00:40:56,900
I have never been more tempted to booze
since I quit booze and then this goddamn

665
00:40:57,200 --> 00:40:59,880
week, but I got 200 days coming
up. I didn't want to fuck that up.

666
00:40:59,881 --> 00:41:04,590
And then once I go over 200 days,
that's it. I'm just gonna fucking, uh,

667
00:41:05,220 --> 00:41:09,180
I think I'm just going to pull myself
out, you know, like cal Ripkin.

668
00:41:09,181 --> 00:41:13,140
I'm just going to say all right to
hell with this shit. You know? Fuck it.

669
00:41:14,430 --> 00:41:18,420
What more do I need to prove?
So like I have a drinking problem.

670
00:41:18,421 --> 00:41:19,950
I just have a huge head problems.

671
00:41:24,440 --> 00:41:27,400
Do you guys know that?
That's really the real reason why I quit.

672
00:41:27,940 --> 00:41:31,970
Not because I was getting drunk,
coming home, blaming my day on Nia,

673
00:41:31,971 --> 00:41:36,971
slapping around a kitchen table and then
later taken out a fucking frozen box of

674
00:41:38,690 --> 00:41:40,760
peas and putting it on the
side of her fucking left titty.

675
00:41:40,970 --> 00:41:45,260
Cause I gave her a fucking
uppercut. Right? That's not why.

676
00:41:46,250 --> 00:41:49,820
It's because I already have a giant head,
a pumpkin head,

677
00:41:49,880 --> 00:41:51,950
as some of the people on
the Internet have said,

678
00:41:55,700 --> 00:42:00,590
which always makes me giggle. Um, that's
why I quit drinking. I just got sick.

679
00:42:00,980 --> 00:42:04,100
There's something like,
look, who's kidding? Who?

680
00:42:04,130 --> 00:42:08,180
You hit middle age and I don't give
a fuck. You just don't look as good.

681
00:42:08,630 --> 00:42:12,950
But there's no reason to help it along.
You know what I mean?

682
00:42:12,951 --> 00:42:17,300
It's pure vanity. That's why I
fucking stopped. And uh, you know,

683
00:42:17,301 --> 00:42:21,210
you know the deal, you know in the broads,
they fucking hit middle age. They've,

684
00:42:21,211 --> 00:42:21,491
they've,

685
00:42:21,491 --> 00:42:25,910
they've squeezed out a couple of fucking
kids now they resent the fuck anybody

686
00:42:25,911 --> 00:42:28,100
who has free time,
you know,

687
00:42:28,101 --> 00:42:32,120
because they made a decision to take a
hot one right between the fucking legs,

688
00:42:32,570 --> 00:42:35,990
you know, that was your choice.
So I want to have a kid,

689
00:42:36,150 --> 00:42:39,890
they're so cute and then they have one
and then there are a bunch of fucking,

690
00:42:40,790 --> 00:42:44,120
it's mother's Day this week. Everybody,
let's not lose sight of that.

691
00:42:45,900 --> 00:42:50,480
This is going to go bed. Uh, Jesus. Um,

692
00:42:51,680 --> 00:42:54,030
yeah mothers are just,
they're fucking pains in the air.

693
00:42:54,140 --> 00:42:57,020
Then another reason to go to pro flowers
and give him a bouquet and shove it in

694
00:42:57,021 --> 00:43:00,260
their face. All right
already we got it. You agree?

695
00:43:00,261 --> 00:43:04,700
You regretted your decision and I'm
a fucking reminder of it. So anyways,

696
00:43:05,330 --> 00:43:10,000
um, I'm already picturing profile was
people listening to it that's just such,

697
00:43:10,340 --> 00:43:13,040
lets you know, is this groundbreaking
way of selling flowers?

698
00:43:13,280 --> 00:43:18,140
Cause it seems weird to me. Um, anyway,

699
00:43:18,220 --> 00:43:21,470
I'll talk about how people age,
right? So what a women do. Okay.

700
00:43:21,620 --> 00:43:25,700
Then they have a couple of kids and
they're so fucking God damn busy.

701
00:43:26,830 --> 00:43:29,870
All right. That not only do they
not have time to do a sit up,

702
00:43:29,900 --> 00:43:33,050
they don't even have time to
fucking wash their hair anymore.

703
00:43:33,380 --> 00:43:36,890
So they all go out and get that Wayne
Gretzky haircut that he had when he got

704
00:43:36,891 --> 00:43:37,724
married.
You know,

705
00:43:37,990 --> 00:43:42,200
I'll show it on the side like Adolf
Hitler and then they poof it up on top.

706
00:43:42,260 --> 00:43:46,280
You know, the Katie Lang, they get that
haircut and they're like, oh my God,

707
00:43:46,281 --> 00:43:49,250
I love it. I love it. It's
so easy to deal with, right?

708
00:43:49,460 --> 00:43:52,310
Not knowing that when their husband,
Ben's them over,

709
00:43:52,400 --> 00:43:54,290
they feel like they're fucking a dude.

710
00:43:55,700 --> 00:43:56,533
You know,

711
00:43:58,200 --> 00:44:02,400
a dude with tits, right? That's what
you feel like. So that's how they age,

712
00:44:03,120 --> 00:44:03,541
you know?

713
00:44:03,541 --> 00:44:08,541
And then what happens with guys guys
age like John Travolta and Alec Baldwin.

714
00:44:09,480 --> 00:44:14,130
It's very rare that a celebrity will
actually just continue to fucking eat and

715
00:44:14,131 --> 00:44:17,970
booze and do what regular people do when
just allow themselves to age the way

716
00:44:17,971 --> 00:44:22,170
regular people do. You know that
shit. You know that deal way? Uh,

717
00:44:23,040 --> 00:44:25,980
I don't know. Eat like a pig all summer
and then it comes the wintertime.

718
00:44:26,190 --> 00:44:30,780
You take out your button down shirt and
you got a t shirt on underneath it cause

719
00:44:30,781 --> 00:44:34,260
you don't to sweat your way through it
cause you're such a fat fucking booze bag

720
00:44:34,261 --> 00:44:37,140
at that point. And then you
just, you don't even notice.

721
00:44:37,150 --> 00:44:39,330
And all of a sudden for
some reason you used to be,

722
00:44:39,331 --> 00:44:41,700
you can only see a tee
shirt up top near your neck.

723
00:44:41,940 --> 00:44:46,320
Now you can see it in between like each
button because the fucking fabric of

724
00:44:46,321 --> 00:44:49,920
your button down is stretched.
So God damn far, that's why,

725
00:44:50,520 --> 00:44:53,850
that's why I quit booze.
And I had, uh, you know,

726
00:44:54,120 --> 00:44:57,150
every year I buy like four or five
button down shirts and those are my,

727
00:44:57,151 --> 00:45:01,830
I'm going to headline for an hour doing
comedy shit, uh, shirts, right. And,

728
00:45:02,190 --> 00:45:05,760
uh, they usually last me a year, but I
had this one and I didn't even notice.

729
00:45:06,660 --> 00:45:08,550
You know, cause you know, you put
it on a couple of pounds a week,

730
00:45:08,551 --> 00:45:10,640
you don't fucking know. It's all of a
sudden I was taking pictures and the,

731
00:45:10,890 --> 00:45:13,740
and the button that was right,
you know,

732
00:45:14,220 --> 00:45:18,180
between my man tits was
that the fabric was just,

733
00:45:18,210 --> 00:45:23,010
it looked like the shirt was going to
explode. So that's basically why I,

734
00:45:23,400 --> 00:45:27,720
uh, that's why I quit the
Busan. So, uh, I recommend it.

735
00:45:27,810 --> 00:45:30,900
I recommend going off the
sauce for a minute. Um,

736
00:45:31,140 --> 00:45:34,530
so now what I want to experiment
with as far as my boozing,

737
00:45:34,710 --> 00:45:36,570
and I want to know if
there's anybody tried this,

738
00:45:38,310 --> 00:45:42,870
I'm going to drink one day
a month and when I do, it's,

739
00:45:42,900 --> 00:45:46,860
it's gonna be fucking epic.
I'm going to get it all out,

740
00:45:47,330 --> 00:45:49,740
all out of the way in one day,

741
00:45:50,550 --> 00:45:53,790
beer and whiskey all at the same time.

742
00:45:53,791 --> 00:45:58,791
Giant chalices of fucking booze and a
then I'm going to hate myself for like a

743
00:46:00,721 --> 00:46:03,360
day or two and then I'm just
going to get on with my month.

744
00:46:04,020 --> 00:46:05,460
Has anybody been able to do that?

745
00:46:05,610 --> 00:46:08,640
Because I tried doing that last time
and then it became a twice a month,

746
00:46:08,641 --> 00:46:09,630
three times a month.

747
00:46:10,050 --> 00:46:13,680
And next thing you know I'm
doing a fucking keg stand
and my face is turning red

748
00:46:13,681 --> 00:46:18,390
and I'm just like, what am I doing? You
know, but I don't think I'm an alcoholic.

749
00:46:19,020 --> 00:46:22,680
I just have a job where I can booze.
You know,

750
00:46:24,180 --> 00:46:26,490
what's the worst that happens?
I show up,

751
00:46:26,491 --> 00:46:29,790
hung over and I bitch about how I'm a
fucking loser and then everybody laughs

752
00:46:29,940 --> 00:46:32,910
because they feel better about their
lives. Like he's doing worse than us.

753
00:46:33,030 --> 00:46:37,080
This guy's awesome. So, uh, let
me know if you guys out there,

754
00:46:37,081 --> 00:46:42,060
do you have any sort of, uh, do you
have any sort of, I don't know, like,

755
00:46:42,510 --> 00:46:45,560
cause anybody been able to do
that? Like just say, I'm, I'm,

756
00:46:45,570 --> 00:46:49,260
I only drink Saturdays or I
drink one Thursday a month.

757
00:46:49,261 --> 00:46:53,520
Has anybody been able to stick with
that? I Dunno. That's my thing.

758
00:46:53,521 --> 00:46:58,320
I'm afraid to go back to it because a,
I was really, I was looking like, well,

759
00:46:58,321 --> 00:47:02,720
I don't look like a Baldwin, but my torso
did. You know I had the Baldwin Torso,

760
00:47:02,730 --> 00:47:06,030
I the John Travolta Torso,
you know,

761
00:47:06,820 --> 00:47:10,740
a Ted Kennedy Body. That's why the fuck
I was. Gino said that shit, by the way,

762
00:47:11,280 --> 00:47:15,570
Bill Maher's in rolling stone this past
week and I read it and he said, how,

763
00:47:15,690 --> 00:47:19,680
you know, he just sticks to weed and
they say, do you not like alcohol?

764
00:47:19,681 --> 00:47:23,670
And he basically, I'm
paraphrasing here, he said he
loves it. He said, but as a guy,

765
00:47:23,671 --> 00:47:27,360
after a while you just have to stop
drinking or you end up looking like Ted

766
00:47:27,360 --> 00:47:29,650
Kennedy and it's fucking true.
Especially a white dude.

767
00:47:29,651 --> 00:47:33,610
You get that WC fields knows,
hey, my little chickadee.

768
00:47:34,480 --> 00:47:36,850
You don't want to look like that.
All right. You get the yellow eyes.

769
00:47:36,851 --> 00:47:41,390
You get that fucking jaundice.
Oh God.

770
00:47:41,391 --> 00:47:45,200
But I miss it. Um, anyways,
let's plow ahead here. Um,

771
00:47:45,890 --> 00:47:47,840
so anyways, I was talking about my, uh,

772
00:47:47,870 --> 00:47:52,520
can I say anyways any more
fucking times on this podcast. Um,

773
00:47:52,550 --> 00:47:57,550
another thing that went on this week
is we had the second antisocial comedy

774
00:47:58,281 --> 00:48:00,350
network show,
um,

775
00:48:01,340 --> 00:48:04,370
that we did up at Foxwoods
in a 4,000 seat theater.

776
00:48:04,371 --> 00:48:05,810
And we actually sold the thing out.

777
00:48:05,811 --> 00:48:10,590
I was a absolutely blown away by not
only the amount of people showed up,

778
00:48:10,700 --> 00:48:13,640
but how great the crowd was.
Everybody was talking about it.

779
00:48:13,641 --> 00:48:15,380
For those of you who are on the outside,

780
00:48:15,620 --> 00:48:18,650
the anti social network tours
put together by a Jim Norton,

781
00:48:18,651 --> 00:48:23,000
little Jimmy from the wonderful
opie and Anthony Radio program.

782
00:48:25,040 --> 00:48:27,620
Um, he put together this
towards me, Jim brewer,

783
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:31,520
Dave Attell and obviously Jim Norton.
And um,

784
00:48:32,690 --> 00:48:34,700
we've been selling a ton of
tickets and it's been great.

785
00:48:34,701 --> 00:48:39,190
Everybody does 20 minutes. We come out,
we hit you with our best stuff. And uh,

786
00:48:39,200 --> 00:48:40,970
we kicked the shit out of
that crowd and they weren't,

787
00:48:40,971 --> 00:48:44,120
they were just a great crowd. They
laughed. You could bring them up,

788
00:48:44,121 --> 00:48:46,910
you could bring them down.
They were just a phenomenal crowd.

789
00:48:46,911 --> 00:48:51,110
And then we just do a little question
and answering afterwards, I'm like,

790
00:48:51,111 --> 00:48:53,900
five minutes. And then we hold ourselves
out afterwards, taking pictures,

791
00:48:53,901 --> 00:48:56,870
signing shit. And everybody goes
back to gambling. And it was, uh,

792
00:48:57,530 --> 00:48:58,910
just this amazing theater.

793
00:48:58,911 --> 00:49:02,000
I was actually talking to brewer because
I'd had this fucking upper deck and we

794
00:49:02,001 --> 00:49:05,750
immediately started talking about playing
wiffle ball and about whether or not

795
00:49:05,751 --> 00:49:08,930
we could hit the upper deck from the,
uh,

796
00:49:10,310 --> 00:49:12,710
from the stage man. And a, this one was,

797
00:49:12,740 --> 00:49:17,480
it was just close enough where it
was a nice fucking poke. But, uh,

798
00:49:18,460 --> 00:49:19,880
uh, Jesus, that would've
been a great time,

799
00:49:19,881 --> 00:49:22,400
except the people who run the theater
would have thought it was obnoxious,

800
00:49:23,060 --> 00:49:23,893
you know?

801
00:49:24,850 --> 00:49:25,080
Yeah.

802
00:49:25,080 --> 00:49:25,850
Look at these guys.

803
00:49:25,850 --> 00:49:29,460
You get to tell jokes and play
wiffle ball with the fuck what next?

804
00:49:29,520 --> 00:49:34,330
They can drink every night.
Uh,

805
00:49:34,350 --> 00:49:36,920
but I want to thank everybody
who came down there and, uh,

806
00:49:36,921 --> 00:49:39,290
if that tour interest you,
uh,

807
00:49:39,470 --> 00:49:42,560
we've been selling a ton of tickets
down there and a Washington DC.

808
00:49:42,680 --> 00:49:44,810
We're playing there on May 13th.

809
00:49:45,530 --> 00:49:48,290
So get your fucking ass is down there.
All right,

810
00:49:48,350 --> 00:49:52,460
look at it's so goddamn recession you
get for comics for the fucking price of

811
00:49:52,461 --> 00:49:55,940
one. I am just whoring
myself out on this podcast.

812
00:49:58,900 --> 00:50:02,650
proflowers.com now I'm hyping the tour
before I've even brought you an hour's

813
00:50:02,651 --> 00:50:06,790
worth of comedy.
How fucking dare I look at me.

814
00:50:06,820 --> 00:50:09,280
I'm becoming a corporate cont everything.

815
00:50:09,390 --> 00:50:13,240
What were you guys do if I just totally
fucking sell out on this podcast?

816
00:50:13,450 --> 00:50:17,740
I stopped saying cunt.
I actually build a cubicle around my bed.

817
00:50:20,990 --> 00:50:22,940
I changed the name of the podcast.

818
00:50:22,970 --> 00:50:27,970
This is brought to you by the Halliburton
Monday morning podcast that we do

819
00:50:29,270 --> 00:50:31,880
every day now because the
higher ups are making us aid.

820
00:50:31,940 --> 00:50:35,540
Do you know Halliburton actually
changed their fucking name? Um,

821
00:50:36,530 --> 00:50:40,400
that was a weird way of saying, um,
uh, I was working down in Houston,

822
00:50:40,401 --> 00:50:44,150
Texas and that's where they have, uh, at
least their United States headquarters.

823
00:50:44,690 --> 00:50:45,410
And uh,

824
00:50:45,410 --> 00:50:50,410
they used to have this giant sign as
you went to a George Bush international,

825
00:50:50,631 --> 00:50:54,950
go fuck yourself. I love the
Illuminati airport down there. Um,

826
00:50:55,010 --> 00:50:58,490
and they had this giant sign down there
that would say Halliburton and they had

827
00:50:58,491 --> 00:51:02,180
such a bad public image is that they
actually made the sign a lot smaller and

828
00:51:02,181 --> 00:51:06,560
they kept making it smaller and then now
they just finally changed their names

829
00:51:06,590 --> 00:51:10,130
to like, uh, you know, grandma's
cupcakes or something like that.

830
00:51:10,131 --> 00:51:14,030
Something just completely,
yeah. Pedestrian. Um,

831
00:51:14,960 --> 00:51:18,590
you know, it's funny, I don't even
know what they do. Isn't that typical?

832
00:51:18,770 --> 00:51:21,410
Isn't that just typical of
several whiny fucking cunt?

833
00:51:21,440 --> 00:51:24,770
I have no idea what they even do.
What do they do?

834
00:51:26,410 --> 00:51:27,730
What did they,
as far as I know,

835
00:51:27,731 --> 00:51:32,731
this is my layman's understanding
of what they do is basically,

836
00:51:33,480 --> 00:51:34,313
okay,

837
00:51:34,840 --> 00:51:39,370
they say to the Pentagon, will you guys
blow it up? And then we'll rebuild it.

838
00:51:39,910 --> 00:51:42,790
We'll get our contractors in there,
you know,

839
00:51:44,200 --> 00:51:48,640
and we'll build a little strip mall.
We'll stick a Starbucks in there.

840
00:51:48,720 --> 00:51:52,540
And that way everybody's
going to want to be American.

841
00:51:53,950 --> 00:51:56,680
Everybody's going to want you don't
fucking fat. I feel right now.

842
00:51:56,681 --> 00:52:01,220
I just went to a steak house and there
was these fucking real housewives chicks

843
00:52:01,221 --> 00:52:06,100
sitting up at the bar.
These four white ladies,

844
00:52:07,090 --> 00:52:11,680
you know, just dress like
horse. I'll tell you right now,

845
00:52:11,710 --> 00:52:16,240
if you're a mom and you still dress like
you're out there trying to get fucked,

846
00:52:16,800 --> 00:52:20,140
you're just a terrible mother,
you know, and they should really,

847
00:52:20,141 --> 00:52:22,210
they should repossess your fucking kids.

848
00:52:22,370 --> 00:52:25,210
And this is just going to all be about
mothers this week as I try to get you to

849
00:52:25,211 --> 00:52:30,040
buy flowers.
You know,

850
00:52:30,730 --> 00:52:35,170
what are you doing with the
tight fucking jeans? You know,

851
00:52:35,420 --> 00:52:38,830
you're fucking Goddamn hip hugger jeans,

852
00:52:40,210 --> 00:52:44,440
Goddamn c section scar just above
your badassador belts for fuck sakes.

853
00:52:44,441 --> 00:52:47,770
Put some clothes on.
You're a mother. It's over.

854
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:53,890
You know, do you know I worked
with someone recently, right? And,

855
00:52:54,280 --> 00:52:57,130
and they will fucking, you know,
they mentioned that they had a kid.

856
00:52:57,131 --> 00:53:00,790
So I'm always asking about kids cause
I'm seriously thinking about having one,

857
00:53:01,450 --> 00:53:05,650
you know, sticking him in the
corner next to a vase. You know,

858
00:53:08,830 --> 00:53:13,330
just adding to like my, my
possessions. I'll have my guitars.

859
00:53:14,050 --> 00:53:17,110
I've got a couple of guitars. What else
do I have? I don't know. A lot of shit.

860
00:53:17,440 --> 00:53:18,280
I got a desk,

861
00:53:18,281 --> 00:53:21,490
I'll stick in between the guitars and
the desk just that Monday they are.

862
00:53:21,491 --> 00:53:21,731
And like,

863
00:53:21,731 --> 00:53:24,700
you know when you have like those cakes
that they have under glass at diners,

864
00:53:24,701 --> 00:53:26,340
I'll just a fucking baby in there.

865
00:53:27,150 --> 00:53:30,240
Every once in awhile it
usually I'll lift the lid up

866
00:53:31,590 --> 00:53:32,030
[inaudible] just

867
00:53:32,030 --> 00:53:36,020
fucking put it back over, give
it a bottle, knock it off.

868
00:53:36,740 --> 00:53:38,090
Hey,
knock it off,

869
00:53:39,070 --> 00:53:43,220
visit awake and I'll just just tap on
the glass. That's really creepy. No,

870
00:53:43,300 --> 00:53:47,420
I've been thinking about
having a kid. Right. So, um,

871
00:53:48,200 --> 00:53:53,060
I ran into this mother after a show and
she was talking about her son and she

872
00:53:53,061 --> 00:53:57,800
look young, right? She was like
30, 31 years old. And I go, uh,

873
00:53:58,320 --> 00:54:01,250
I go, how old is your son? She goes, 11.

874
00:54:02,900 --> 00:54:05,060
And then she mentioned she had a
daughter. I go, how was your daughter?

875
00:54:05,061 --> 00:54:08,480
And she goes, 13. So I do the
math. She had him at 18 to 20.

876
00:54:09,440 --> 00:54:13,550
And I was just like, Jesus
Christ. I, yeah, you started
young hunt. She winks at me.

877
00:54:13,551 --> 00:54:17,060
She goes, yeah, got it out of the
way. She goes, now it's me time.

878
00:54:18,470 --> 00:54:19,460
I'm just thinking in my head,

879
00:54:19,490 --> 00:54:24,290
what do you mean me time there were 11
and 13 the fuck are you to, you know,

880
00:54:25,130 --> 00:54:27,740
that's why I really think
it's a good thing that I,

881
00:54:27,741 --> 00:54:32,741
I haven't had kids yet
because I'm a selfish cunt
and I'm really into doing shit

882
00:54:33,920 --> 00:54:37,160
for myself. And it's just a lot
of people out there. I Dunno.

883
00:54:37,250 --> 00:54:40,820
I think they just have kids
and then they that are all,

884
00:54:40,821 --> 00:54:45,110
they stick them in front of the TV,
watch a little Teletubby, you know,

885
00:54:45,510 --> 00:54:46,670
and they're just bad parents.

886
00:54:46,671 --> 00:54:49,820
And then every once in a while you see
a great fucking parent who's really

887
00:54:49,821 --> 00:54:53,420
involved with this kid. Like this youtube
video that somebody sent me this week,

888
00:54:53,900 --> 00:54:58,610
this guy sent me a youtube video of
his seven year old son, uh, is a drama.

889
00:54:58,611 --> 00:55:02,660
This kid is this shit. Not only can he
play, cause I've seen kids play before,

890
00:55:02,661 --> 00:55:06,440
but he actually sings along with the
song and he has a lookup passion on his

891
00:55:06,441 --> 00:55:09,980
face. It's fucking awesome. Uh, you
can watch all these videos, by the way,

892
00:55:09,981 --> 00:55:13,190
on the [inaudible] podcast.com.
Um,

893
00:55:13,220 --> 00:55:16,730
the only thing I will say to this to the
dad is you've got to get that kid some

894
00:55:16,731 --> 00:55:21,410
sort of a, you got to get them
earplugs. You gotta get them those, uh,

895
00:55:21,830 --> 00:55:23,960
those Vic first earphones
that you just put,

896
00:55:23,961 --> 00:55:26,600
it looks like the kids get to use a
weed whacker. Just have them wear those.

897
00:55:27,030 --> 00:55:28,820
It'll seem weird for the
first couple of days,

898
00:55:28,821 --> 00:55:32,930
but I'm telling you that the kids ears
are going to be fucking junk if you let

899
00:55:33,020 --> 00:55:37,340
him play without earplugs. Uh,
take it from me. I suffer from, uh,

900
00:55:37,510 --> 00:55:39,920
tonight is a Tetnis,
however the fuck you say it.

901
00:55:40,400 --> 00:55:44,300
And that's that ringing in
the year. Um, but you know,

902
00:55:44,301 --> 00:55:46,820
there's nothing better than when you
actually see good parents. And I get it.

903
00:55:46,821 --> 00:55:51,170
I get nervous, said I'm not going to
be a good dad. Um, and whenever I see,

904
00:55:51,171 --> 00:55:52,004
you know,

905
00:55:52,160 --> 00:55:57,160
whenever I see a bunch of fucking
women who are mothers just dressed like

906
00:55:57,981 --> 00:56:01,370
they're out there looking to get banged,
it's just like,

907
00:56:01,371 --> 00:56:05,930
there's no way you're a good mom.
You can't be a good mom.

908
00:56:05,960 --> 00:56:10,220
You get dress too nicely.
You know, moms look,

909
00:56:11,120 --> 00:56:12,800
they wear comfortable clothes.

910
00:56:13,820 --> 00:56:17,240
They have that fucking look on
their face like Jesus Christ.

911
00:56:17,241 --> 00:56:19,490
What did I do with my life?
That's a mom.

912
00:56:20,650 --> 00:56:25,630
You got sit down there with Ed Hardy
panties and then going out? Yeah,

913
00:56:25,631 --> 00:56:29,650
my, my dad or just graduated
the seventh grade. Really?

914
00:56:30,310 --> 00:56:31,570
The fuck are you doing?

915
00:56:31,900 --> 00:56:34,870
What are you out here riding on the
back of the Harley with your Goddamn ass

916
00:56:34,871 --> 00:56:37,900
crack showing you're
not a mom right there.

917
00:56:38,910 --> 00:56:43,510
You ought to get a warning. You know, you
should get a warning dress like a mom.

918
00:56:43,511 --> 00:56:44,680
Get the fuck Outta here.

919
00:56:46,350 --> 00:56:49,320
Sitting here drinking your God damn
booze in the middle of the day.

920
00:56:50,360 --> 00:56:55,260
How would your Bra straps showing
the fuck is wrong with you lady?

921
00:56:56,410 --> 00:57:00,540
Uh, am I wrong thinking that? Am I
just being selfish? Because you know,

922
00:57:00,541 --> 00:57:02,880
when I become a dad,
I still want to have a cool car.

923
00:57:02,910 --> 00:57:06,510
I don't have that fucking van. I
wouldn't have a car. That's cool.

924
00:57:06,511 --> 00:57:10,140
And my kids aren't allowed in it. And
when they asked me why, I'm going to say,

925
00:57:10,370 --> 00:57:13,500
because at your age you're still
a fucking animal. Look at you.

926
00:57:13,660 --> 00:57:17,370
You got cheerios all over your face.
You got ice cream on your fingers.

927
00:57:17,490 --> 00:57:18,960
I don't even remember.
You have an ice cream.

928
00:57:19,110 --> 00:57:23,540
What is that shit you think you're
going to get my dodge fucking challenge.

929
00:57:24,720 --> 00:57:27,120
I'm just going to have one nice car.

930
00:57:27,960 --> 00:57:31,830
That's going to be for me and Nia
when we go out and we get a sitter,

931
00:57:32,640 --> 00:57:36,240
right? That's, that's the uh,

932
00:57:36,720 --> 00:57:40,680
let's pretend we don't have responsibility
car and we'll go out and have a

933
00:57:40,681 --> 00:57:44,610
dinner and come back in a couple hours
and then we'll just have some shit

934
00:57:44,611 --> 00:57:47,710
fucking van,
uh,

935
00:57:47,720 --> 00:57:52,720
Shit van with those fucking Nascar
Formula One seat belts that criss cross in

936
00:57:52,911 --> 00:57:57,170
front of you, both for safety and also
so those little bastards can't get up.

937
00:57:58,070 --> 00:57:58,790
You know,

938
00:57:58,790 --> 00:58:02,000
I still think I'm going to be a good dad
despite the horrific shit of sand right

939
00:58:02,001 --> 00:58:02,834
now.

940
00:58:07,640 --> 00:58:11,210
Um, somebody sent me a great, oh, by
the way, my specialists still showing,

941
00:58:11,211 --> 00:58:14,930
still streaming on Netflix, by
the way. I want you guys' opinion.

942
00:58:14,960 --> 00:58:16,940
I'm thinking the next time I do a special,

943
00:58:17,090 --> 00:58:21,740
I'm sending my special directly to
Netflix because I think when I sent it to

944
00:58:21,741 --> 00:58:24,350
channels where they have
commercials and they censor it,

945
00:58:24,650 --> 00:58:29,240
you're not getting the re the full on
ignorant Bill Burger experience are you,

946
00:58:29,480 --> 00:58:33,830
you know, it just, you know,
you really want to see the
level of more on that. I am.

947
00:58:33,831 --> 00:58:37,640
You have to have the uncensored version.
So I'm thinking that that's the future.

948
00:58:38,180 --> 00:58:42,950
I'm loving it because people will watch
Netflix or are there if they seem like

949
00:58:43,100 --> 00:58:44,480
they're getting the real special to me,

950
00:58:45,170 --> 00:58:48,710
which means they either absolutely love
it or they think I'm the dumbest person

951
00:58:48,711 --> 00:58:52,490
on the planet. Uh, with that, let's
get into advice for this week.

952
00:58:53,100 --> 00:58:56,000
This podcast is going to be a little
shorter than the recently I've been doing

953
00:58:56,001 --> 00:58:59,480
like an hour and 20. I think
they're too fucking long. Um,

954
00:59:00,080 --> 00:59:03,290
so I'm going to try and do about an hour.
Come right in and about an hour.

955
00:59:03,800 --> 00:59:08,500
You know, let's just long
enough for your commute. Um,

956
00:59:08,740 --> 00:59:10,750
Oh, before I read the advice that
I'd tell you guys, I'm working,

957
00:59:10,751 --> 00:59:14,650
I'm trying to work on my temper now
that I got the booze on the control,

958
00:59:16,300 --> 00:59:18,640
uh, and now I'm going to
work on my temper. See,

959
00:59:18,641 --> 00:59:22,730
this is me slowly giving into the fact
that I'm going to get married at some

960
00:59:22,731 --> 00:59:24,680
point. I can't even say that
I'm going to get married.

961
00:59:24,681 --> 00:59:28,070
Then I'm going to get married at some
point. I'm going to have kids. All right.

962
00:59:28,670 --> 00:59:31,910
First thing I had to do is I had to stop
drinking. Like I was pledging a frat.

963
00:59:31,940 --> 00:59:35,150
That was the first fucking
thing I had to do. You know?

964
00:59:36,020 --> 00:59:37,130
Although when I have kids,

965
00:59:37,131 --> 00:59:41,840
I'm going to be really tempted at the
end of my long workday doing absolutely

966
00:59:41,841 --> 00:59:44,570
nothing as a comedian,
you know,

967
00:59:45,650 --> 00:59:48,710
not to just pour that scotch with
the one fucking ice cube in it.

968
00:59:48,740 --> 00:59:52,430
I don't want to do that in front of kids.
Maybe I'll have a shed out back.

969
00:59:54,180 --> 00:59:55,013
Okay.

970
00:59:56,870 --> 01:00:00,640
And that's what I'll do. All my Busan.
Right. And then eventually, you know,

971
01:00:00,760 --> 01:00:03,670
I'll think that I'm fooling everybody and
then I'll have a bottle in the back of

972
01:00:03,671 --> 01:00:08,320
the fucking half bathroom in the basement,
you know,

973
01:00:08,410 --> 01:00:11,090
in the back of the toilet.
Then everybody had no on Busan.

974
01:00:11,100 --> 01:00:13,780
And then eventually when they have the
intervention will be out there in that

975
01:00:13,781 --> 01:00:14,614
shit.

976
01:00:15,490 --> 01:00:19,570
Bill thinks he's doing a documentary and
I'm going to be fucking sitting there a

977
01:00:20,490 --> 01:00:25,450
walk in. This is why I do most of my
drinking and I'll be all noble about it.

978
01:00:25,451 --> 01:00:29,700
I never do it in front
of my kids. You know, my,

979
01:00:30,760 --> 01:00:35,710
my kids fear everything could be, you
know, eventually I'm going to stop, right?

980
01:00:35,711 --> 01:00:37,090
And then I go walking in there.

981
01:00:37,700 --> 01:00:41,530
My whole disappointed family's going
to be sitting there next to a band saw.

982
01:00:46,080 --> 01:00:49,560
And I'm a stubborn Irish mother fucker.
I'm not going to rehab. Go Fuck Yourself.

983
01:00:50,970 --> 01:00:55,920
You go to Rehab. Oh, we're all
walking out. God, more booze.

984
01:00:55,921 --> 01:00:59,580
Money for me.
Um,

985
01:01:00,060 --> 01:01:01,590
I ain't know what the hell
I'm talking about right now.

986
01:01:01,591 --> 01:01:03,360
Have you guys been watching
the playoff hockey?

987
01:01:03,361 --> 01:01:08,361
Congratulations to everybody's team
or moved on to San Jose Sharks.

988
01:01:12,180 --> 01:01:15,030
The Detroit Redwings, the Nashville
predators. Who would've thought, oh,

989
01:01:15,031 --> 01:01:18,930
what a fuck it thought. Who the hell are
they playing out? Their kings are out.

990
01:01:18,931 --> 01:01:23,190
Ducks are out. Oh, Vancouver, Vancouver.

991
01:01:24,030 --> 01:01:28,890
And then over in the east to one cheese.
I don't know who wants series last week.

992
01:01:28,891 --> 01:01:30,780
A Tampa Bay lightning,

993
01:01:31,740 --> 01:01:34,080
Washington capitals,

994
01:01:35,760 --> 01:01:38,520
Philadelphia Flyers.

995
01:01:39,930 --> 01:01:44,460
And I think that's it. I think that's
the, uh, those are, oh, wait a minute.

996
01:01:45,450 --> 01:01:46,800
Oh,
Jesus.

997
01:01:46,801 --> 01:01:51,801
I almost forgot the Boston
Bruins beat the fucking fuck.

998
01:01:52,471 --> 01:01:56,890
Fucking fucking Montreal Canadians. Oh,

999
01:01:56,891 --> 01:01:59,610
was that enjoyable?
What a tremendous series.

1000
01:01:59,830 --> 01:02:02,920
Round of applause for playoff hockey.
It went seven games.

1001
01:02:02,921 --> 01:02:06,760
Like you knew what was gonna and I
thought it was a tremendous series,

1002
01:02:06,761 --> 01:02:11,761
although I was a little disappointed
with the certain members of the Montreal

1003
01:02:13,390 --> 01:02:16,300
Canadians with that bitch level of hockey,
that fucking

1004
01:02:18,610 --> 01:02:19,443
Hammer Lik Jesus Christ.

1005
01:02:21,210 --> 01:02:24,960
I thought he was in some fucking slap
stick movie. What was he doing out there?

1006
01:02:24,961 --> 01:02:27,470
Anytime you went,
move fucking skate,

1007
01:02:27,650 --> 01:02:32,340
the wind of you skating by the
guy would just fall down of funny.

1008
01:02:32,341 --> 01:02:34,460
Was that when, what's his
face? The Bruins announcer.

1009
01:02:34,470 --> 01:02:38,520
I can never remember his name. John,
whatever. When he fucking Egos here,

1010
01:02:38,810 --> 01:02:41,790
Millette goes down like
he was shot jet up.

1011
01:02:43,140 --> 01:02:46,800
I'm not a fan of that over the top
sort of fucking announcing, but I,

1012
01:02:46,810 --> 01:02:51,810
that was so fucking called for when he
said that it was fucking ridiculous.

1013
01:02:52,141 --> 01:02:54,400
But uh,
but it was just a,

1014
01:02:54,401 --> 01:02:57,600
it was a phenomenal series
and I knew it was going seven,

1015
01:02:57,660 --> 01:02:59,520
seven games and I was
hoping we were going to win.

1016
01:02:59,521 --> 01:03:02,160
I'm not even going to talk shit, you
know, I'm not even going to talk shit.

1017
01:03:02,161 --> 01:03:05,340
Whenever you play the Canadians, they
have fans, even if their team sucks,

1018
01:03:05,341 --> 01:03:10,020
they take them to the next level was
a fucking awesome series. And uh,

1019
01:03:10,050 --> 01:03:14,340
that fucking sue bond guy man is the shit.
That guy is a star.

1020
01:03:14,341 --> 01:03:18,540
And I loved the way he plays the game.
I even love that annoying shit. He does.

1021
01:03:19,110 --> 01:03:20,250
I love it.
He's a Gamer.

1022
01:03:20,251 --> 01:03:23,880
He's just trying to knock you off your
fucking game by being a cunt. I love it.

1023
01:03:23,910 --> 01:03:24,990
And he can play the game.

1024
01:03:24,991 --> 01:03:29,830
And that fucking goal that he scored
to send it into overtime was, uh,

1025
01:03:30,000 --> 01:03:32,850
there was just a fucking laser beam.
But I gotta tell you,

1026
01:03:32,851 --> 01:03:37,500
there is some sort of unwritten NHL rule
that if the Montreal Canadians are down

1027
01:03:37,501 --> 01:03:39,480
by a goal in a deciding game,

1028
01:03:39,840 --> 01:03:42,840
I don't give a fuck whether
you committed a penalty or not.

1029
01:03:42,841 --> 01:03:44,820
You're going to be short
a man. They just, I mean,

1030
01:03:44,821 --> 01:03:49,800
how many fucking years in a row can they
do that for that team? It's ridiculous.

1031
01:03:49,860 --> 01:03:54,390
Wasn't it enough that for
all those fucking decades
they got first shot at every

1032
01:03:54,391 --> 01:03:58,650
French born Canadian player?
Wasn't that enough that they got,

1033
01:03:58,651 --> 01:04:00,450
they had their own draft pool.

1034
01:04:00,690 --> 01:04:05,280
It has six team league this so fucking
overrated with their goddamn history.

1035
01:04:05,430 --> 01:04:06,211
And I love that.

1036
01:04:06,211 --> 01:04:10,650
When Bruins fans talk to him
now all Canadian fans have
is their history. What's,

1037
01:04:10,680 --> 01:04:14,880
what's the historical playoff
series record? Yeah, that's right.

1038
01:04:14,881 --> 01:04:16,980
Go back a quarter to
have a fucking century.

1039
01:04:16,981 --> 01:04:21,690
Since the last time you dominated us, you
fucking French cunts. You got nothing.

1040
01:04:21,810 --> 01:04:25,080
You haven't dominated
us since 1987 it's over.

1041
01:04:25,590 --> 01:04:29,460
It's fucking over now. If you want
to trash us for not winning a cup,

1042
01:04:29,461 --> 01:04:32,790
I don't have a dog in that fight.
We're fucking horrific. It's pathetic.

1043
01:04:32,791 --> 01:04:36,390
We haven't won in one in almost 40 years.
You're 100% in the right.

1044
01:04:36,391 --> 01:04:39,570
But if you're going to try and sit
there and act like your in the way,

1045
01:04:39,720 --> 01:04:44,560
you're not. Go do your fucking
homework there. Frenchie all right,

1046
01:04:46,530 --> 01:04:51,530
we've played you guys 11 times since
1988 we beaten you seven fucking times.

1047
01:04:52,400 --> 01:04:56,010
Have four and seven against us.
We'd beat you in a seven game series.

1048
01:04:56,390 --> 01:04:59,520
We'd beat you all three overtime
games and last time we played you,

1049
01:04:59,521 --> 01:05:01,560
we swept you when the
last two games at home.

1050
01:05:01,561 --> 01:05:06,270
So I don't know what the fuck you're
talking about and Dan Shaughnessy you lazy

1051
01:05:06,271 --> 01:05:10,260
mother fucker. If you're not going to
watch hockey, stop writing about it.

1052
01:05:10,261 --> 01:05:12,450
You know that son of a bitch
when we want to game seven,

1053
01:05:12,570 --> 01:05:17,530
he still figured out a way to shoehorn
in the curse of the Babe Horse that he

1054
01:05:17,531 --> 01:05:18,520
always writes about.

1055
01:05:19,000 --> 01:05:21,880
There's nothing funnier than watching
Dan Shaughnessy writing about hockey.

1056
01:05:21,881 --> 01:05:26,590
He knows nothing about it. He started
bringing up Johnny Pesky, you know,

1057
01:05:27,340 --> 01:05:29,380
ted Williams.
Bucky Dent.

1058
01:05:29,770 --> 01:05:33,220
He then the man can only write one
fucking story if there's not a ghost,

1059
01:05:33,460 --> 01:05:37,090
a Goblin or a or in it. He doesn't
know how to write the fucking article.

1060
01:05:38,110 --> 01:05:42,100
You know, it's fucking ridiculous. Why?
Why don't you address the real problems,

1061
01:05:42,101 --> 01:05:46,960
Dan Shaughnessy like how the Bruins
resented free agency. Not only didn't,

1062
01:05:46,961 --> 01:05:49,000
didn't play the game,
they fucking resented it.

1063
01:05:49,120 --> 01:05:51,940
They didn't want to fucking pay anybody.
Why don't, why don't you talk about that?

1064
01:05:52,450 --> 01:05:56,140
Or the Canadians drafting first pick
of every French born Canadian player.

1065
01:05:56,141 --> 01:05:59,950
Why don't you bring shit up like that
as opposed to sounding like you're

1066
01:05:59,980 --> 01:06:03,610
pitching a show to go on
after ghost hunters. Oh,

1067
01:06:03,640 --> 01:06:07,750
somebody get that guy a hot comb and
a fucking book on Goddamn hockey.

1068
01:06:08,630 --> 01:06:12,760
All right, let's plow
ahead here. Um, advice,

1069
01:06:12,820 --> 01:06:17,170
advice for the week. Um, oh
wait, I promise these guys.
I was going to read it.

1070
01:06:17,440 --> 01:06:19,090
Now that I've said con 20 times,

1071
01:06:19,450 --> 01:06:22,690
I promise that I was going to read this
thing three times during the podcast.

1072
01:06:22,691 --> 01:06:26,290
So we're at the halfway point.
Everybody open yourself up a beer.

1073
01:06:26,440 --> 01:06:30,370
Go sharpen a fucking pencil at your
cubicle or whatever the hell it is you do

1074
01:06:30,371 --> 01:06:34,870
there. Once again, people, Mother's
Day is this Sunday. All right,

1075
01:06:35,050 --> 01:06:37,690
don't be a Douche.
Just go to proflowers.com.

1076

Click on the microphone in the upper right
hand corner when you type in the code.

1077
01:06:42,160 --> 01:06:47,020
Uh, right. B U. R. R. So I get credit on
my podcast and just order some flowers.

1078
01:06:47,140 --> 01:06:48,820
You'll get a vase,
you get the whole damn thing.

1079
01:06:49,070 --> 01:06:53,620
And then I got to do is take her out to
the IHUB. You know, you get some pancakes.

1080
01:06:54,460 --> 01:06:58,150
What does she like?
Eggs benedict. You know,

1081
01:06:58,151 --> 01:07:01,390
just do something like that or
have you fucking broad do it.

1082
01:07:02,140 --> 01:07:03,610
But this is the thing.
Look,

1083
01:07:03,611 --> 01:07:06,910
if you're a lazy bastard and you want
to look like a good shit this year,

1084
01:07:07,000 --> 01:07:08,170
you could bang it all out.

1085
01:07:08,200 --> 01:07:12,040
You go right to pro flowers
by some for your mother.

1086
01:07:12,280 --> 01:07:15,190
Buy some for your girlfriend's mother
and buy some for your grandmother.

1087
01:07:15,360 --> 01:07:19,510
All right? Then everybody in your life
with a vagina can shut the fuck up.

1088
01:07:19,660 --> 01:07:23,770
Four o'clock man. Seriously? You know
what I mean? Guys, we don't like to shop.

1089
01:07:26,260 --> 01:07:29,170
I should really stick to the copier.
Mother's Day is right around the corner.

1090
01:07:29,171 --> 01:07:31,600
Everybody in pro flowers
has mother's Day bouquets.

hand corner and type in my password.

1093
01:07:39,131 --> 01:07:41,710
B U. R. R, get her a bouquet of flowers.

1094
01:07:41,711 --> 01:07:44,140
Get her a Goddamn vase handed to her,

1095
01:07:44,390 --> 01:07:48,170
telling her lover she's only going to be
around for so goddamn long. You know it.

1096
01:07:48,220 --> 01:07:52,180
I know what you should be doing this
every damn year, every fucking year.

1097
01:07:52,710 --> 01:07:55,930
All right? You go there.
You take her out to Denny's,

1098
01:07:57,030 --> 01:07:59,620
you know plural, Pura Bulla,
corn flakes at that point.

1099
01:07:59,621 --> 01:08:01,900
If you've got the fucking
flowers and the vase.

1100
01:08:02,380 --> 01:08:05,440
Don't be a cheap acid on this one. You
got to get the base too. Like I said,

1101
01:08:05,441 --> 01:08:09,130
don't lay it in her lap like she
just wrote a fucking horse. Okay?

1102
01:08:10,450 --> 01:08:11,380
You get a vase,

1103
01:08:12,700 --> 01:08:17,010
you know women shit.
Alright,

1104
01:08:17,270 --> 01:08:21,890
and vase is, it's just another thing.
Oh my God, he got a vase with it.

1105
01:08:21,891 --> 01:08:25,680
He really does love me. All right, that's
the commercial at the half hour seat.

1106
01:08:25,730 --> 01:08:29,060
Look at this. Look at this. I'm getting
the information in. I'm keeping it funny.

1107
01:08:29,990 --> 01:08:34,790
I'm still saying cunt. It's
just phenomenal. All right.
Uh, advice for this week.

1108
01:08:34,791 --> 01:08:39,170
Dearest bill, my entire life, I've jumped
from one long relationship to another.

1109
01:08:39,200 --> 01:08:43,640
Oh, geesh. At the ripe age of 30,
I've started to see a pattern.

1110
01:08:43,670 --> 01:08:47,570
Good for you. There you go. That's
right. You've seen a pattern.

1111
01:08:47,900 --> 01:08:52,700
Now see people, this is how you improve
your life rather than blaming others.

1112
01:08:52,970 --> 01:08:53,960
It's like being a comedian.

1113
01:08:54,200 --> 01:08:57,110
How many times can you bomb
and say in this crowd sucks.

1114
01:08:57,111 --> 01:09:00,520
At some point you've got to look at
yourself. You gotta you gotta look,

1115
01:09:00,530 --> 01:09:03,710
go to the mirror and look
at your fucking booze bag.

1116
01:09:03,710 --> 01:09:07,070
Freckled face like me a few
months ago and say, listen,

1117
01:09:07,160 --> 01:09:11,090
I've got to lay off the booze. I gotta
I gotta I gotta work on my act here. Um,

1118
01:09:12,080 --> 01:09:13,850
so this is what this guy's doing.
Exactly.

1119
01:09:13,880 --> 01:09:17,270
You keep pulling fish out of the same
poison pond and you getting tired of it.

1120
01:09:17,300 --> 01:09:20,420
Good for you, sir. Here's
the pattern. He goes,

1121
01:09:20,421 --> 01:09:24,380
I start when I start dating a woman,
she's dialed up.

1122
01:09:24,440 --> 01:09:27,140
She's in great shape.
She's fun to be around.

1123
01:09:27,380 --> 01:09:31,430
She's always willing to go the extra
mile by doing little things to show you.

1124
01:09:31,431 --> 01:09:35,240
She cares and she's willing to explore,
enjoy,

1125
01:09:35,360 --> 01:09:38,670
and share my interests.
All right.

1126
01:09:38,671 --> 01:09:43,040
Starting off a little myopic. She
dresses nice in lights to do this shit.

1127
01:09:43,041 --> 01:09:46,850
I though, all right. After a few
months, one year or two, one year,

1128
01:09:46,851 --> 01:09:50,750
she does up about 50% of the time.
She's still in good shape.

1129
01:09:50,751 --> 01:09:52,610
She's fun to be around.
She's a willing,

1130
01:09:52,730 --> 01:09:56,000
she's willing to explore
and share my interests.

1131
01:09:56,690 --> 01:09:59,360
One year on little by little,
things start to disappear.

1132
01:09:59,361 --> 01:10:03,290
She does up 10% of the time.
She's an average to pudgy shape.

1133
01:10:03,500 --> 01:10:07,760
She's fun about half the time and she's
only the willing to share interests

1134
01:10:07,761 --> 01:10:11,650
there are that are already developed.
Oh,

1135
01:10:11,770 --> 01:10:13,100
so she doesn't want to do any new things.

1136
01:10:13,340 --> 01:10:18,140
Each girl seems to stray further and
further away from their month one

1137
01:10:18,141 --> 01:10:20,760
personalities at different rates.
Yet it,

1138
01:10:20,870 --> 01:10:25,130
it seems to always stray away into the
negative zone. Oh, it never gets better.

1139
01:10:25,400 --> 01:10:29,060
I again find myself in a new
relationship, things that, okay,

1140
01:10:29,130 --> 01:10:32,360
so he gets out of that one.
One year in he goes, hey again,

1141
01:10:32,361 --> 01:10:36,320
find myself in a new relationship.
Things are fan fucking tastic.

1142
01:10:36,890 --> 01:10:40,370
I'm living the dream yet I
find myself terrified. Oh,

1143
01:10:40,371 --> 01:10:44,030
so I guess he's in a new relationship.
When will she stop dialing up?

1144
01:10:44,120 --> 01:10:46,160
When will she stop being easygoing?

1145
01:10:46,570 --> 01:10:51,320
When will that little pouch start to grow
above her belt? I'm jaded and scared.

1146
01:10:51,321 --> 01:10:54,590
Bill.
Does the month one girl ever stick around?

1147
01:10:54,830 --> 01:10:59,030
Am I doing something to turn these perfect
girls into comfortable couch potatoes?

1148
01:10:59,300 --> 01:11:02,810
I don't want to see another
one transformed. What do I do?

1149
01:11:02,990 --> 01:11:05,180
I know it's human nature to
get comfortable, comfortable,

1150
01:11:05,181 --> 01:11:08,300
sooner or later to be able to
function as a normal human being.

1151
01:11:08,301 --> 01:11:10,610
It's impossible to keep
that one month girl around,

1152
01:11:10,880 --> 01:11:12,860
but can't they just stay in the one month,

1153
01:11:14,940 --> 01:11:19,560
a year category? Do they have to go beyond
the one year? Oh, as far. And he said,

1154
01:11:19,561 --> 01:11:24,420
okay, am I ready to get billed?
Burned. People liked that one.

1155
01:11:25,020 --> 01:11:27,210
I forget what the other one was.
It was a wait,

1156
01:11:27,211 --> 01:11:31,770
I got it here at the
top of the page. Uh, ah,

1157
01:11:31,800 --> 01:11:35,820
ginger or odd ginger. Snap. Um,

1158
01:11:35,850 --> 01:11:40,140
those are my catch phrases.
Everybody. Um, all right,

1159
01:11:40,141 --> 01:11:45,030
let's plow ahead here. Uh, what
am I up to? Oh, by the way,

1160
01:11:45,960 --> 01:11:49,320
I'm probably going to forget this.
So if my web guy is listening,

1161
01:11:49,410 --> 01:11:54,410
please remind me to put up the
youtube videos of that red headed kid.

1162
01:11:54,930 --> 01:11:59,490
There's some poor bastard. This kid, I
don't know how old he is. He's like 12,

1163
01:11:59,491 --> 01:12:04,260
13 years old and he makes
these videos and he's just,

1164
01:12:04,770 --> 01:12:07,440
he doesn't know any better.
He lives in the middle of nowhere.

1165
01:12:07,441 --> 01:12:11,940
He's just making a total ass of himself.
So every time he, and he's a redhead,

1166
01:12:12,140 --> 01:12:12,600
you know,

1167
01:12:12,600 --> 01:12:16,590
he's already in an awkward age and he's
a red head and he's a redhead mail. So,

1168
01:12:16,591 --> 01:12:19,740
you know, that's just a fucking
hail storm. I lived through it.

1169
01:12:19,800 --> 01:12:20,970
It's not a pretty sight.

1170
01:12:23,100 --> 01:12:27,870
San Jose sharks go up to nothing. Sorry,
got the game on in the background.

1171
01:12:29,190 --> 01:12:32,940
Um, so anyways, yeah, that's,
that's not a fun time.

1172
01:12:32,941 --> 01:12:35,670
It's not a fun time for fucking
anybody unless you know,

1173
01:12:35,970 --> 01:12:38,910
you're just one of the popular kids.
So this kid keeps making these videos.

1174
01:12:39,300 --> 01:12:40,310
So what happened was,

1175
01:12:40,311 --> 01:12:44,310
was people started trashing them
because that's what happens. You know,

1176
01:12:44,340 --> 01:12:46,740
you put yourself out there,
you basically,

1177
01:12:46,741 --> 01:12:50,400
the second you get on a stage or you
film yourself, you've, you basically,

1178
01:12:50,401 --> 01:12:54,450
you put yourself on a Dunkin stool and
given the world a bunch of baseballs,

1179
01:12:54,451 --> 01:12:56,790
that's basically what you've done.
This kid didn't realize it,

1180
01:12:57,270 --> 01:13:01,620
so they start fucking trash in them.
And rather than ignoring it,

1181
01:13:02,130 --> 01:13:06,030
he's been responding to it and
he's yelling into the camera.

1182
01:13:06,990 --> 01:13:09,300
This is a message for
all you haters out there.

1183
01:13:10,050 --> 01:13:12,380
I can make as many videos as I want,

1184
01:13:13,670 --> 01:13:17,520
but all going to continue making videos.
So fuck you.

1185
01:13:17,970 --> 01:13:21,420
He's doing that. And he has faces
all fucking freckled and red.

1186
01:13:21,660 --> 01:13:25,290
He looks like a young Malakai from church,
children of the corn.

1187
01:13:25,830 --> 01:13:30,360
He sings songs. Um, actually
I got a name, a name here,

1188
01:13:30,400 --> 01:13:34,800
a Aziz from a parks and recreation
was down. Uh, I gotta give him,

1189
01:13:34,801 --> 01:13:38,850
I gotta give him credit a Aziz and sorry,
Gee,

1190
01:13:38,851 --> 01:13:42,000
he hooked me up with these videos.
He goes, you got to check these out.

1191
01:13:42,001 --> 01:13:42,631
Cause I was telling him,

1192
01:13:42,631 --> 01:13:46,290
you got to watch that guy at the del
Taco who gets knocked out three fucking

1193
01:13:46,291 --> 01:13:51,290
times in this battle. Royal.
Um, so whatever, see, we got, I,

1194
01:13:51,300 --> 01:13:56,220
I'm hyping that video and I hope that I
remember, uh, to tell my web guy about it.

1195
01:13:56,221 --> 01:13:56,581
If not,

1196
01:13:56,581 --> 01:13:59,340
I hope he's listening to this podcast
and they put it up cause it's fucking

1197
01:13:59,341 --> 01:14:02,640
hilarious. So anyways, let's
get back to this guy. Um,

1198
01:14:03,480 --> 01:14:06,840
he basically asked me how do I, how does
somebody stay in the one month thing?

1199
01:14:06,841 --> 01:14:09,630
Well, let me ask you this, sir.
How do you do over the year?

1200
01:14:09,870 --> 01:14:12,520
Do you put on any weight?
What are you, do you know?

1201
01:14:12,760 --> 01:14:15,850
This is the thing about relationships
that I learned is that they're fucking

1202
01:14:15,851 --> 01:14:16,684
work.

1203
01:14:16,780 --> 01:14:21,430
And it's what you're discovering is that
what happens is you meet somebody and

1204
01:14:21,431 --> 01:14:25,930
yeah, it's exciting. It's new. It's like
a, I don't know, you go on vacation,

1205
01:14:26,260 --> 01:14:28,480
so he never been to Miami.
You go to Miami Beach,

1206
01:14:28,481 --> 01:14:32,620
it's going to be fucking exciting.
All right. He got another vacation.

1207
01:14:32,621 --> 01:14:35,020
You go to Miami beach again.
It's still exciting,

1208
01:14:35,021 --> 01:14:37,690
but it's not quite as you keep
fucking doing the same thing.

1209
01:14:38,740 --> 01:14:42,580
It's just natural that you start taking
things for granted and it works on both

1210
01:14:42,581 --> 01:14:44,590
sides.
Um,

1211
01:14:46,480 --> 01:14:50,440
what I would do is if you want your girl
to stay in shape is I would keep myself

1212
01:14:50,441 --> 01:14:53,530
in shape and uh,
I,

1213
01:14:53,531 --> 01:14:58,270
if you're into a girl that stays in shape
and there's nothing wrong with that,

1214
01:14:58,750 --> 01:14:59,381
by the way,

1215
01:14:59,381 --> 01:15:03,430
there's always on those women's shows
that that's superficial and blah, blah,

1216
01:15:03,431 --> 01:15:06,400
blah, and guys should
look beyond it. Fuck you.

1217
01:15:06,401 --> 01:15:10,270
You're lazy and you want to eat ice
cream and you still want to get the same

1218
01:15:10,390 --> 01:15:14,200
amount of love like you, like you
have an hourglass figure, you know,

1219
01:15:14,230 --> 01:15:18,190
that's just women pimping guys. Okay.
If you want a woman who's in shape,

1220
01:15:18,191 --> 01:15:21,820
why don't you fucking date someone who
likes to work out? That's what I would do.

1221
01:15:22,460 --> 01:15:26,590
Who's into that type of shit? Who to
considers that type of thing important.

1222
01:15:26,710 --> 01:15:27,670
That's what I would do.

1223
01:15:28,090 --> 01:15:31,540
And then you kept saying shit
like she's willing to explore,

1224
01:15:31,550 --> 01:15:35,800
enjoy and share my interest.
Well that's all well and good.

1225
01:15:35,801 --> 01:15:40,510
As long as you're willing to do it
with her. And also I would say that,

1226
01:15:40,660 --> 01:15:41,140
you know,

1227
01:15:41,140 --> 01:15:44,710
you know what's a great thing to do
in a relationship is to have interests

1228
01:15:44,740 --> 01:15:46,420
outside of the other person.

1229
01:15:46,840 --> 01:15:51,790
And the two of you fuck off for for
an hour or two every day. You know,

1230
01:15:52,600 --> 01:15:56,240
like I can tell you if
I'm in a relationship,

1231
01:15:57,180 --> 01:16:00,240
all right. And I joined a
gym. I don't want my, I don't,

1232
01:16:00,300 --> 01:16:04,390
I don't want my girl joining
the same fucking gym. I don't,

1233
01:16:04,420 --> 01:16:09,400
I want two hours by myself. Who's kidding?
Who, 20 minutes on the treadmill and be,

1234
01:16:09,730 --> 01:16:13,030
ah, lift weights tomorrow or
whatever, say like an hour to myself.

1235
01:16:13,210 --> 01:16:17,170
I listen to my music, you
know, I'm looking at at the,

1236
01:16:17,171 --> 01:16:21,880
at the fucking ass and titties of other
girls, right? That's legal, you know,

1237
01:16:22,020 --> 01:16:26,320
they're walking around in their
sports bras. I can do that, you know,

1238
01:16:27,100 --> 01:16:31,060
listen to my ACDC fucking get
pumped, lie to myself, like,

1239
01:16:31,061 --> 01:16:36,061
dude of the summer on putting up to 25
kid fucking two plates on both sides

1240
01:16:37,811 --> 01:16:42,760
stowed. I could lie to myself,
you know, but I definitely think,

1241
01:16:43,270 --> 01:16:47,320
uh, look, I would just say, you
know, the next time you're, you're,

1242
01:16:47,770 --> 01:16:52,710
you're tell, tell your girl
that's, that's, that's your
fear said, yeah, look, I,

1243
01:16:52,711 --> 01:16:55,570
I just keep being in these relationships
and everything just sort of winds down

1244
01:16:55,571 --> 01:16:58,540
everybody, you know, people are in good
shape. I went, you know, I don't know.

1245
01:16:58,541 --> 01:17:00,430
That's kind of a tough thing to say,
to be like,

1246
01:17:00,490 --> 01:17:04,810
are you going to become a fatty
in a year? Um, I don't know, Dude.

1247
01:17:04,811 --> 01:17:08,080
You ever thought about just being single
and just tagging a bunch of chicks who

1248
01:17:08,170 --> 01:17:12,410
were in shape and every night
will be exciting and new.

1249
01:17:12,800 --> 01:17:17,210
Come aboard.
I'm expecting you.

1250
01:17:17,211 --> 01:17:22,080
So ride my single fucking Goddamn cock.

1251
01:17:23,860 --> 01:17:27,650
Um, every, evidently the way you can get
herpes while still wearing a condom is,

1252
01:17:27,680 --> 01:17:29,810
is I guess that the,
uh,

1253
01:17:30,980 --> 01:17:34,820
the party at Dick that's behind the
Maginot line there basically the part,

1254
01:17:34,821 --> 01:17:38,300
you know, you put a condom
on, you roll it down.

1255
01:17:38,301 --> 01:17:40,620
You always have it at fucking
three quarters mass, don't you?

1256
01:17:40,621 --> 01:17:42,110
Even if you stretch it all the way down,

1257
01:17:42,140 --> 01:17:44,030
it doesn't fucking cover your whole Dick.

1258
01:17:44,510 --> 01:17:48,470
There's always going to be the Goddamn Ma,
you know,

1259
01:17:48,770 --> 01:17:51,560
eighth of an inch of shaft.
You know,

1260
01:17:51,940 --> 01:17:54,920
unless you got a huge fucking Dick and
you bought the wrong condoms and half

1261
01:17:55,040 --> 01:17:57,740
your dicks hanging out,
hanging out. Right.

1262
01:17:58,400 --> 01:18:01,910
And the condoms on top of your head and
you have Dick looks like fucking Arnold

1263
01:18:01,911 --> 01:18:05,330
from happy days. Remember that?
Had he used to wear or big al?

1264
01:18:07,100 --> 01:18:11,270
Um, I guess that's how you can
get it. I don't fucking know.

1265
01:18:11,780 --> 01:18:13,880
I don't want to hear about STDs.
It just makes me happy.

1266
01:18:13,881 --> 01:18:17,240
I'm going to fucking relationship, you
know. Um, anyways, let's plow ahead here.

1267
01:18:17,270 --> 01:18:20,870
Next, next question here. Next
fucking question. Uh, Bill,

1268
01:18:20,871 --> 01:18:22,490
big fan of your comedy podcasts.

1269
01:18:22,700 --> 01:18:26,390
Listen to it every Tuesday on the way
home while I'm stuck in traffic. Anyway,

1270
01:18:26,391 --> 01:18:29,360
here's my deal. I moved to
us in order. I just realized,

1271
01:18:29,361 --> 01:18:31,820
I forgot to tell you guys
how I'm working on my temper.

1272
01:18:32,300 --> 01:18:36,860
I decided to break it up into chunks
rather than just trying not to lose my

1273
01:18:36,861 --> 01:18:41,650
shit. I just realized I gotta I,
I just got to attack it and chuck,

1274
01:18:41,651 --> 01:18:46,040
so this is how I'm trying to do it.
I'm just working on my temper in the car.

1275
01:18:46,760 --> 01:18:47,593
That's it.

1276
01:18:48,170 --> 01:18:51,800
And I've been meaning to get a post it
and I'm just going to draw a smiley face

1277
01:18:51,801 --> 01:18:53,570
on it and just stick it on the dashboard.

1278
01:18:58,130 --> 01:19:02,090
That's what I'm trying to do.
And I did it this morning.

1279
01:19:02,091 --> 01:19:06,890
I was able to do it.
I was returning a rental car and uh,

1280
01:19:07,130 --> 01:19:11,510
you know, it's Sunday morning,
I get up, I jump in the car,

1281
01:19:12,110 --> 01:19:17,090
Ford Fusion, great fucking car
to man getting this car. And I,

1282
01:19:17,570 --> 01:19:20,690
uh, they should be no traffic.
I should just shoot right up,

1283
01:19:20,720 --> 01:19:23,930
get the car back by nine 30 so I
don't have to pay for the extra day.

1284
01:19:24,260 --> 01:19:28,130
And what happens, there's all this
construction and I got to admit,

1285
01:19:28,370 --> 01:19:31,850
it took me a while to lose my shit,

1286
01:19:31,880 --> 01:19:36,650
but when the fucking Douche cut
into my lane, I, that was it.

1287
01:19:37,170 --> 01:19:40,390
I just fucking without
even thinking, just, just

1288
01:19:42,030 --> 01:19:42,360
[inaudible],
just

1289
01:19:42,360 --> 01:19:46,500
pushing down on the horn and a,
when I stopped, I was like, oh fuck.

1290
01:19:46,501 --> 01:19:47,830
I lost my temper. I guy, I gotta,

1291
01:19:47,880 --> 01:19:50,640
I gotta stop and then somebody else did
something and I fucking laid on the horn

1292
01:19:50,641 --> 01:19:53,010
twice. So, so I failed.

1293
01:19:53,790 --> 01:19:58,790
You know what the fuck that's off sides
through the officiating has just sucked

1294
01:19:59,791 --> 01:20:03,180
in the NHL,
this whole fucking place.

1295
01:20:03,181 --> 01:20:06,990
How bad were the fucking calls first
game? Uh, on both sides, by the way.

1296
01:20:07,950 --> 01:20:12,690
On both sides. At least. That first
period is what I really watched, um,

1297
01:20:14,100 --> 01:20:17,900
of the, uh, Bruins flyers by the
way, which is by the time I, uh,

1298
01:20:17,910 --> 01:20:20,190
you listened to this podcast,
let's do it on Tuesday.

1299
01:20:20,370 --> 01:20:23,010
That series is going to be one,
one going back to Boston.

1300
01:20:23,310 --> 01:20:25,890
I think this is going to
be a great series. Uh,

1301
01:20:27,060 --> 01:20:31,930
and I think it's going to be one of those
series where, yeah, I dunno. It's weird.

1302
01:20:31,990 --> 01:20:34,600
The Bruins are weird.
They're just on their game right now.

1303
01:20:34,870 --> 01:20:39,430
But when they're not on their
game, they, they just, I dunno.

1304
01:20:39,490 --> 01:20:41,860
It's like they're playing the
fucking ice out in the ice.

1305
01:20:41,861 --> 01:20:45,220
Capades so I don't know.
I'm nervous about that happening.

1306
01:20:45,221 --> 01:20:47,800
And I also with the flyers
did to us last year,

1307
01:20:48,880 --> 01:20:53,200
but the thing is is the flyers have
no fucking goaltending as a right now.

1308
01:20:53,890 --> 01:20:56,560
So, uh, Tim Thomas is
just fucking ridiculous.

1309
01:20:56,561 --> 01:20:57,970
So I think we're going to win the series.

1310
01:20:57,971 --> 01:21:02,020
I actually think we might take it
in six games. If we win game two,

1311
01:21:02,021 --> 01:21:06,550
we went into six. If they win game
two, uh, this fucker's going seven.

1312
01:21:07,420 --> 01:21:10,480
That's my prediction. Everybody, for
those of you want, don't watch hockey,

1313
01:21:10,481 --> 01:21:12,340
you probably don't give a
shit to you. All right, Bill,

1314
01:21:12,430 --> 01:21:15,160
big fan of your comedy podcasts. Let's do
it every Tuesday and the way they work.

1315
01:21:15,161 --> 01:21:16,750
Anyway, here's my deal. I moved to Austin,

1316
01:21:16,751 --> 01:21:21,520
Texas about three fucking
years ago because of a job
I had just broken up with a

1317
01:21:21,750 --> 01:21:23,590
long time on again, off again, girlfriend,

1318
01:21:23,591 --> 01:21:25,450
and was finally done
with the relationship.

1319
01:21:25,720 --> 01:21:30,720
I made the decision to be single for
a while and enjoy the single life in

1320
01:21:30,731 --> 01:21:34,420
Austin. Worked out well,
but I soon meadow lane,

1321
01:21:36,170 --> 01:21:40,460
she turned out to be the girl from
me and I was soon shopping for rings.

1322
01:21:40,640 --> 01:21:43,040
So we're getting married in the fall.
Congratulations.

1323
01:21:43,041 --> 01:21:45,380
And I moved in about six months ago.
You see,

1324
01:21:45,381 --> 01:21:49,310
my girl is a real hard
worker as am I. Uh, Jesus.

1325
01:21:49,940 --> 01:21:53,180
Crisis is fucking long.
Settle in everybody.

1326
01:21:53,540 --> 01:21:55,460
No one has ever given us anything in life.

1327
01:21:55,520 --> 01:21:58,820
And we both worked hard to earn what
we have. And because of our hard work,

1328
01:21:58,821 --> 01:22:01,430
we both have successful careers,
careers.

1329
01:22:01,640 --> 01:22:04,670
My Boston accent just came
out their successful careers.

1330
01:22:05,510 --> 01:22:09,410
So she's busted her ass through college,
got a job, and bought a house in her own.

1331
01:22:09,411 --> 01:22:13,460
Impressive because she was only
24 at the time. God Damn it.

1332
01:22:13,461 --> 01:22:18,380
I wish I lived in Texas and could buy a
house at 24 middle of fucking nowhere.

1333
01:22:18,410 --> 01:22:22,280
Anyways, and since then we have worked
hard to make it a home together.

1334
01:22:22,310 --> 01:22:27,230
All sounds good, right? Yeah, that sounds
great. Well there is a catch. Oh Jesus.

1335
01:22:27,231 --> 01:22:28,010
Here we go.

1336
01:22:28,010 --> 01:22:33,010
She has this friend who she's known since
childhood and they grew up together.

1337
01:22:34,730 --> 01:22:39,440
This sounds like a fucking
romantic comedy. They are like
sisters, blah, blah, blah.

1338
01:22:39,441 --> 01:22:43,970
She let her friend move into
the house before we met. Oh No.

1339
01:22:44,660 --> 01:22:47,960
And was barely charging
the girl rent at all.

1340
01:22:48,380 --> 01:22:52,190
She also had her sister moving, but as
soon as we decided to live together,

1341
01:22:52,191 --> 01:22:55,720
as sister moved out, like a
normal fucking person. Anyways,

1342
01:22:55,721 --> 01:22:58,010
so this friend of hers is
still living in the house.

1343
01:22:58,011 --> 01:23:01,700
Even six months after we got
engaged and moved in together.

1344
01:23:02,330 --> 01:23:03,920
Not only did she stay,

1345
01:23:04,010 --> 01:23:09,010
she also had her boyfriend move in while
living there and while living there she

1346
01:23:10,771 --> 01:23:13,560
bought a cat and a dog. Well,
I mean, what the fuck dude?

1347
01:23:13,561 --> 01:23:17,310
How come you're not saying anything?
Oh, well here's the next sentence.

1348
01:23:17,311 --> 01:23:21,900
I had a million talks with my girl about
it and how it's wildly inappropriate to

1349
01:23:21,901 --> 01:23:25,620
have these people and animals living in
our house when we're trying to start a

1350
01:23:25,621 --> 01:23:26,310
family,

1351
01:23:26,310 --> 01:23:31,310
but she feels responsible
for the wellbeing of her
friend and doesn't want to

1352
01:23:31,441 --> 01:23:35,490
throw her out on her ass.
Oh No.

1353
01:23:36,640 --> 01:23:37,340
Okay.

1354
01:23:37,340 --> 01:23:41,450
Holy Shit Dude. How big
is this house? Anyways,

1355
01:23:41,451 --> 01:23:43,760
eventually I talked to my girl and just
sitting down with her friend and her

1356
01:23:43,761 --> 01:23:47,120
boyfriend and kindly tell them it's time
to start looking for another place to

1357
01:23:47,121 --> 01:23:49,880
live.
They agreed and everything was all good,

1358
01:23:50,150 --> 01:23:54,980
so three months later the friends still
doesn't have a job and her boyfriend is

1359
01:23:54,981 --> 01:23:58,040
only working part time.
As far as I can tell,

1360
01:23:58,041 --> 01:24:00,860
they haven't started looking
for jobs or a place to live.

1361
01:24:01,160 --> 01:24:05,870
I've heard her complaining to my girl
about not wanting to sign a lease on a

1362
01:24:05,871 --> 01:24:09,620
dump because she is planning on getting
a job and we'll be able to afford a

1363
01:24:09,621 --> 01:24:13,300
nicer place soon. Yeah, she's
stringing you along. It's bullshit.

1364
01:24:13,310 --> 01:24:17,410
She's the laziest bitch I ever met.
Sounds like a dude.

1365
01:24:17,430 --> 01:24:21,300
The way you're describing and I already
hate her. I'm coming home every work day.

1366
01:24:22,700 --> 01:24:24,680
Uh, I'm going wrong for work
everyday. And her boyfriend,

1367
01:24:24,860 --> 01:24:28,940
her and her boyfriend are sitting
on the couch playing video games.

1368
01:24:31,510 --> 01:24:32,440
Oh my God.

1369
01:24:32,441 --> 01:24:36,480
I also recently found out that my girl
is not charging her friend any rented all

1370
01:24:36,640 --> 01:24:39,100
and that boyfriend only pays 200 a month,

1371
01:24:39,340 --> 01:24:44,340
which is nothing compared to what he could
be making with the fuck what we could

1372
01:24:44,351 --> 01:24:47,470
be making with the roommate.
And he's a fucking loser as well.

1373
01:24:47,471 --> 01:24:50,200
30 years old and never had
a fulltime job in his life.

1374
01:24:50,380 --> 01:24:53,290
He brags about not having
any debt all the time,

1375
01:24:53,470 --> 01:24:56,860
but it's because he's a loser and he's
been living off his girlfriend's student

1376
01:24:56,861 --> 01:25:00,550
loans and my girls kindness
for the past two years.

1377
01:25:01,430 --> 01:25:01,720
Okay.

1378
01:25:01,720 --> 01:25:03,040
Do I have to read the rest of this?

1379
01:25:03,790 --> 01:25:06,760
Let me blow through the last
two paragraphs in Murcia
[inaudible] and this thing,

1380
01:25:06,761 --> 01:25:09,850
people try to keep the shortage.
I suck at reading here. Um,

1381
01:25:09,851 --> 01:25:12,130
I would be constantly bitching
about these people to my girl,

1382
01:25:12,131 --> 01:25:13,900
but it kills her to,
to know,

1383
01:25:15,220 --> 01:25:15,590
okay

1384
01:25:15,590 --> 01:25:16,520
that I'm not happy.

1385
01:25:18,220 --> 01:25:21,610
She spends a lot of time trying
to make my life better and I can,

1386
01:25:21,670 --> 01:25:25,180
I really can't stand to
see her sad or frustrated.

1387
01:25:25,610 --> 01:25:26,950
She stuck in a tight spot.
Yeah.

1388
01:25:27,140 --> 01:25:30,670
Do the same thing she's doing with
you that she hates to see you,

1389
01:25:30,671 --> 01:25:34,030
not happy and she wants to keep you happy.
She's still in that with her friends.

1390
01:25:34,510 --> 01:25:38,440
She has to make a stand here.
So he says, so to make a point,

1391
01:25:38,441 --> 01:25:40,300
I've been leaving my
stuff out in the kitchen,

1392
01:25:40,420 --> 01:25:43,660
in the living room and not cleaning up
after myself and in front of everybody.

1393
01:25:43,810 --> 01:25:46,360
I tell my girlfriend to
leave it that she should,

1394
01:25:46,390 --> 01:25:49,900
that they should have to clean it up
because we're doing them a favor for

1395
01:25:49,901 --> 01:25:50,980
letting them live there.

1396
01:25:51,220 --> 01:25:55,210
I've pretty much been a cock sucker
openly to them everyday for the last three

1397
01:25:55,211 --> 01:25:59,650
months. But they haven't gotten the hint.
Yeah, they have their fucking dead beats.

1398
01:25:59,651 --> 01:26:02,560
So just ignoring it.
So anyways,

1399
01:26:02,561 --> 01:26:05,180
but me behaving like that makes my
girlfriend uncomfortable. Comfortable too.

1400
01:26:05,181 --> 01:26:06,530
So I backed off a bit.

1401
01:26:06,710 --> 01:26:09,590
So the latest is that they finally are
starting to pick up on the fact that we

1402
01:26:09,591 --> 01:26:11,660
want them out in or making
provisions to move out.

1403
01:26:11,900 --> 01:26:14,990
But I've recently found out that they
are planning on moving in with my girl's

1404
01:26:14,991 --> 01:26:17,180
mom just down the street.

1405
01:26:17,630 --> 01:26:21,890
Her mom's thinks of the friends is a
daughter or a good family friend in is

1406
01:26:21,891 --> 01:26:22,701
allowing this.

1407
01:26:22,701 --> 01:26:26,840
This pisses me off because I know they're
just going to mooch off from mom just

1408
01:26:26,841 --> 01:26:31,580
like they did my girl. So now I know
I'm planning on having another talk. No,

1409
01:26:31,610 --> 01:26:34,580
don't do that.
Don't do that.

1410
01:26:34,581 --> 01:26:39,290
So now I'm planning another talk with
them about starting their own life

1411
01:26:39,740 --> 01:26:41,270
separate from my girl or her family.

1412
01:26:41,270 --> 01:26:44,150
But I know they wouldn't get the message
unless they came out and became a

1413
01:26:44,151 --> 01:26:46,700
complete Dick, which would totally
killed my girlfriend. What should I do?

1414
01:26:47,120 --> 01:26:51,740
This is what you do. Alright. Um,

1415
01:26:53,330 --> 01:26:57,710
let him move into your, my girlfriend's
mom's house. Let them fucking do it.

1416
01:26:57,711 --> 01:27:02,060
Get it out of your house. All
right? Eventually there will they,

1417
01:27:02,080 --> 01:27:06,890
they will wear out their welcome at your
mom's house and then they're gone. It's,

1418
01:27:06,891 --> 01:27:09,620
it's,
but the thing is right now is if you,

1419
01:27:10,820 --> 01:27:14,810
if you tell her mom that they fucking
dead beats in that type of shit,

1420
01:27:15,000 --> 01:27:18,290
[inaudible] if you'll either come
off like a dick or she'll say,

1421
01:27:18,291 --> 01:27:21,200
well then to hell with it,
they're not moving in. And
then there'll be like, well,

1422
01:27:21,201 --> 01:27:25,700
we can move out of your place and now
you're stuck with them. All right?

1423
01:27:25,701 --> 01:27:29,570
You have the things that wouldn't
leave in your fucking house and they're

1424
01:27:29,571 --> 01:27:34,070
leaving. Let them leave. Let them go
down to your sister's mom's house.

1425
01:27:34,071 --> 01:27:37,160
This is probably where your, you, you,
I mean your girlfriend's mom's house.

1426
01:27:38,090 --> 01:27:42,860
This is probably where she learned
that fucking behavior from, you know,

1427
01:27:43,550 --> 01:27:47,720
so that's her house right now.
What it is,

1428
01:27:47,721 --> 01:27:52,700
is you personally hate these motherfuckers
and you want them to live in this

1429
01:27:53,240 --> 01:27:55,820
shithole that they so
rightfully deserve to live in.

1430
01:27:56,060 --> 01:27:59,750
So what you're doing right
now is you're letting your,

1431
01:27:59,770 --> 01:28:04,220
your personal hatred of them get
in the way of your ultimate goal,

1432
01:28:04,221 --> 01:28:08,210
which is to get them the fuck out of
the house, which is happening, okay?

1433
01:28:08,540 --> 01:28:11,780
If her mother wants to take them in,
let her do it,

1434
01:28:12,080 --> 01:28:14,690
and eventually she will discover
that they're fucking mooches.

1435
01:28:14,691 --> 01:28:18,500
Now I know what you're thinking. Like
what kind of a fucking future son in law,

1436
01:28:18,501 --> 01:28:22,460
my, if I don't give her the
heads up, and I'm telling you,

1437
01:28:22,461 --> 01:28:26,570
just judging by the way
your future bride is,

1438
01:28:27,020 --> 01:28:28,400
this is just how they are.

1439
01:28:29,060 --> 01:28:32,240
They're giving people who get
taken advantage of by mooches.

1440
01:28:32,630 --> 01:28:37,630
And the same way your fiance
is learning this lesson,

1441
01:28:39,320 --> 01:28:40,570
your mother's going to learn the lessons.

1442
01:28:40,571 --> 01:28:44,520
So these people are actually great that
they came into your life because the,

1443
01:28:44,600 --> 01:28:49,460
hopefully you'll be able to use them as
an example, all throughout your marriage,

1444
01:28:49,640 --> 01:28:51,890
whatever their fucking names are.
You going to be like, well look,

1445
01:28:51,891 --> 01:28:56,030
we're going to end up in another situation
like Kathy and Michael. Fuck face.

1446
01:28:56,031 --> 01:29:00,380
Remember that when they sat on the goddamn
couch playing Atari for three fucking

1447
01:29:00,381 --> 01:29:05,210
years? Um, yeah, dude, listen,

1448
01:29:05,750 --> 01:29:08,210
you don't want to fight both those fights.
You'll end up like America.

1449
01:29:08,340 --> 01:29:10,800
You going to have two wars going on
at once. You're going to go bankrupt.

1450
01:29:10,860 --> 01:29:13,940
Don't do that shit. All right.
[inaudible] is your house.

1451
01:29:14,180 --> 01:29:18,110
Let him go to fucking Afghanistan. Don't
fucking worry about it. Or vice versa.

1452
01:29:18,111 --> 01:29:21,710
We went into Afghanistan first. I don't
know how to fucking say it. I don't read.

1453
01:29:22,990 --> 01:29:25,960
I don't give a shit a Douche
bag of the week, by the way,

1454
01:29:26,050 --> 01:29:29,200
is Hammernik from fucking the Canadians.
That guy's an all star man.

1455
01:29:29,201 --> 01:29:30,250
He knows better than that.

1456
01:29:30,760 --> 01:29:35,350
Flopping around out there like he's
on Fucking, I love Lucy or something.

1457
01:29:35,351 --> 01:29:37,960
Doing a good Carol Burnett show.
Doing a goddamn sketch.

1458
01:29:40,040 --> 01:29:42,560
Jared up. All right, last
one. I'm going to read here.

1459
01:29:42,561 --> 01:29:46,130
Everybody coming up on an hour keeping
this one nice and tight. Hey Bill,

1460
01:29:46,131 --> 01:29:49,010
I love you. Stand up comedy on your
podcasts are freaking hilarious.

1461
01:29:49,011 --> 01:29:51,940
Thank you very much. I love what you're
doing and I hope you keep doing it, bro.

1462
01:29:52,180 --> 01:29:53,420
Log [inaudible] thank you.

1463
01:29:53,810 --> 01:29:57,830
I'm a junior in high school and I really
have a problem with my mom's boyfriend.

1464
01:29:59,420 --> 01:30:02,780
Uh, yes, I would think so
for the obvious reasons,

1465
01:30:02,781 --> 01:30:05,060
but we're not going to get into that
because you're too young to talk about it.

1466
01:30:05,450 --> 01:30:09,440
I don't know what to do because my mom
used to be really cool and she would

1467
01:30:09,441 --> 01:30:13,340
really listen to me when her boyfriend
wasn't around. Now when he comes over,

1468
01:30:13,341 --> 01:30:17,050
she makes,
she makes me Cook my own dinner,

1469
01:30:17,440 --> 01:30:18,910
which isn't that bad to do,

1470
01:30:19,060 --> 01:30:22,000
but the fact that she ignores
me and listens to him more

1471
01:30:24,200 --> 01:30:26,660
than she does to me is
what really gets to me.

1472
01:30:27,020 --> 01:30:31,820
This guy can be a real asshole to
me and my mom, oh Jesus Christ.

1473
01:30:31,821 --> 01:30:35,360
And the thing is that they fight all
the time and yet they're still together.

1474
01:30:35,361 --> 01:30:38,630
After five years, you can tell
a Douche bag when you see one,

1475
01:30:38,780 --> 01:30:42,950
and this guy really takes the trophy of
number one douche bag in the country.

1476
01:30:42,980 --> 01:30:43,731
All right,
you know what?

1477
01:30:43,731 --> 01:30:47,400
Fuck that Douche bag of the week
is the due date in this kid's mom.

1478
01:30:48,030 --> 01:30:53,030
He even yells at my mom's sometimes and
I felt the urge to confront him one time

1479
01:30:53,480 --> 01:30:56,870
and my mom is the one who gets mad
at me for trying to defend her.

1480
01:30:57,530 --> 01:31:00,260
I feel like this guy has
changed my mom from a nice,

1481
01:31:00,350 --> 01:31:04,820
cool mom to one of those reality show
moms who don't really give a shit about

1482
01:31:04,821 --> 01:31:09,110
their kids. Yeah. See this
is why you gotta be careful
who you let into your life.

1483
01:31:09,740 --> 01:31:13,490
This guy has kids and he treats them
way worse than he treats my mom.

1484
01:31:13,670 --> 01:31:17,840
I feel really bad for his kids for
having such a bad father figure in their

1485
01:31:17,841 --> 01:31:20,880
lives. Yeah. This guy's
horrific. He's now,

1486
01:31:21,080 --> 01:31:23,510
he's never gotten violent
with my mom I think,

1487
01:31:23,511 --> 01:31:28,070
but I think my mom has gotten dependent
on him for some fucked up reason. Yeah.

1488
01:31:28,280 --> 01:31:30,920
Cause he's probably doing that.
He's working on a self esteem.

1489
01:31:31,010 --> 01:31:34,700
He probably criticizes the shit out of
her and he's turned a nice, positive,

1490
01:31:34,701 --> 01:31:38,930
great mom into a negative person who's
not paying attention to our kid. Yeah.

1491
01:31:38,931 --> 01:31:40,190
She's got a dump.
This guy,

1492
01:31:40,880 --> 01:31:45,080
and I'm pretty sure it's taken a toll
on what my mom is like as a person.

1493
01:31:45,290 --> 01:31:48,920
I have no idea what my mom sees in him
because they have practically nothing in

1494
01:31:48,921 --> 01:31:51,200
common and he's a total asshole to her.

1495
01:31:51,201 --> 01:31:54,860
And to me what I really need his advice
on how I can handle this situation,

1496
01:31:55,010 --> 01:31:58,670
what I can do to make this situation
better for me and my mom besides choking

1497
01:31:58,671 --> 01:32:00,550
this in the middle of the night.

1498
01:32:00,790 --> 01:32:03,490
I would really appreciate
some sound advice from you,

1499
01:32:03,491 --> 01:32:05,200
even though you don't have kids.

1500
01:32:08,800 --> 01:32:12,310
I would also like to know if you were
doing any gigs or any shows around

1501
01:32:12,311 --> 01:32:15,460
southern California, because I really
like to see in person. Thanks bill.

1502
01:32:15,490 --> 01:32:20,470
All right. This is what you gotta
do. All right. This is very tricky.

1503
01:32:21,130 --> 01:32:26,130
One of the hardest things to do is when
somebody you love is dating an asshole

1504
01:32:26,201 --> 01:32:27,880
to approach them and say,
Hey,

1505
01:32:27,881 --> 01:32:31,210
I think the person you're dating is an
asshole because they're going to get

1506
01:32:31,211 --> 01:32:35,560
unbelievably defensive. All right?
So I would leave that part out of it.

1507
01:32:36,880 --> 01:32:39,790
What I would do is when that
Douche bag isn't around,

1508
01:32:40,540 --> 01:32:45,040
I would basically tell your mom what you
told me, minus the bad shit about him.

1509
01:32:46,360 --> 01:32:49,780
Just say, listen. You know,
I just feel like you know,

1510
01:32:49,781 --> 01:32:52,780
you're not listening to me as much
as you used to tell your lover.

1511
01:32:53,000 --> 01:32:54,850
Tell her she's the greatest mom.
And just,

1512
01:32:54,880 --> 01:32:58,780
just tell her that you felt like you
used to be closer and that you're feeling

1513
01:32:58,781 --> 01:33:02,530
like you're not as close as you
used to be and that you know,

1514
01:33:02,531 --> 01:33:06,070
you realize that you're her time
with their boyfriend is important.

1515
01:33:06,280 --> 01:33:08,930
But I'd like to have a whatever schedule,

1516
01:33:09,320 --> 01:33:12,490
schedule some hang time with you guys.
And you know what,

1517
01:33:12,491 --> 01:33:15,490
when you guys are out there having a
good time, maybe she can, you know,

1518
01:33:15,520 --> 01:33:17,860
slowly turn into that
person she used to be.

1519
01:33:19,210 --> 01:33:23,770
And then eventually you kind of trick
her into talking about that guy and let

1520
01:33:23,771 --> 01:33:26,860
her be the first one. This is, this is
down the road. Let her, once you guys,

1521
01:33:26,861 --> 01:33:30,390
you know, have your hang day, you
know, and I'll tell you right now, if,

1522
01:33:30,420 --> 01:33:34,300
if that guy gets in the way,
which you probably will try to,

1523
01:33:34,450 --> 01:33:37,840
cause he sounds like an insecure douche
bag that if you guys are actually

1524
01:33:37,841 --> 01:33:38,674
hanging out,

1525
01:33:38,890 --> 01:33:42,070
you know there's a lot of like little
Mussolini's run around the world.

1526
01:33:42,071 --> 01:33:45,970
They just don't have the fucking charisma
and the right cataclysmic moment in

1527
01:33:45,971 --> 01:33:49,690
history to take power. So what they
do is rather than ruining countries,

1528
01:33:49,691 --> 01:33:53,980
they just ruined families. Every one
that they come in contact with. So this,

1529
01:33:53,981 --> 01:33:55,300
that's what this cost is like.

1530
01:33:55,480 --> 01:33:58,690
And he'll probably try and take that
time away from you guys because he'll be

1531
01:33:58,691 --> 01:34:02,710
convinced because in the back of his head,
I bet he knows he's a fucking asshole.

1532
01:34:03,910 --> 01:34:04,060
Um,

1533
01:34:04,060 --> 01:34:07,180
or he's a paranoid psycho and he thinks
everybody's talking about them anyways,

1534
01:34:07,181 --> 01:34:12,040
which of course you attract what
you fear in life. So I think,

1535
01:34:12,520 --> 01:34:16,090
uh, just keep it about you and
her. Tell her how great she is.

1536
01:34:16,180 --> 01:34:19,080
Mother's Day is coming up. It's
perfect. And just say, listen, you know,

1537
01:34:19,100 --> 01:34:22,780
I'm getting older. These next few
years are going to fly by. You know,

1538
01:34:23,140 --> 01:34:26,800
I'd like to take advantage of this time.
Let's spend time together. You know,

1539
01:34:26,801 --> 01:34:29,620
just you and me.
Like we used to just one day a week.

1540
01:34:29,621 --> 01:34:31,300
I respect your time with your boyfriend,
but you know,

1541
01:34:31,301 --> 01:34:34,540
one day a week I'm your son for Christ
sake. We could do this. And like I said,

1542
01:34:34,541 --> 01:34:38,620
during that time, um, that
Douche won't be around.

1543
01:34:39,240 --> 01:34:42,580
It'll be just the two of you.
I bet the old her comes out a little bit.

1544
01:34:42,850 --> 01:34:46,180
If you do it once a week, it's
like therapy. And like I said,

1545
01:34:46,210 --> 01:34:48,250
eventually you let you
let her bring it up,

1546
01:34:48,251 --> 01:34:52,510
let her bring up with that
guy's an asshole. You know,
he's kind of been a dick,

1547
01:34:52,511 --> 01:34:55,030
you know what I mean? He just kind
of sit there like, yeah, yeah,

1548
01:34:55,031 --> 01:35:00,020
I don't know what you mean. And just
respectfully call the guy and asshole.

1549
01:35:00,230 --> 01:35:03,620
And as far as choking that guy in the
middle of the night, don't do that now.

1550
01:35:03,920 --> 01:35:06,380
Don't do that. Wait till you
like high school years. You know,

1551
01:35:06,800 --> 01:35:09,410
wait til you hit your growth spurt.
You know, you start filling out,

1552
01:35:09,411 --> 01:35:12,950
you start throwing the weights around.
That's when you do it. You know,

1553
01:35:12,980 --> 01:35:17,390
take a nice karate class. Go with the
submission whole, that's what I would do.

1554
01:35:17,420 --> 01:35:21,230
You know, you choke them out.
They just go to sleep. You know,

1555
01:35:21,260 --> 01:35:24,260
there's no concussion, there's nothing
like, he just, he just takes a little nap.

1556
01:35:28,640 --> 01:35:33,530
I'm not advocating violence. Wink, wink.
I'm all right. Youtube videos a week.

1557
01:35:33,531 --> 01:35:35,090

1567
01:36:10,640 --> 01:36:13,100
and anyways, all these youtube
videos, we'll be up there. Next one,

1568
01:36:13,101 --> 01:36:17,300
greatest dance number ever
filmed according to Fred Astaire,

1569
01:36:17,301 --> 01:36:21,680
who was considered the greatest
dancer of that time. But, uh,

1570
01:36:21,710 --> 01:36:24,140
he was a phenomenal dancer,
but he was also a white dude.

1571
01:36:24,141 --> 01:36:27,800
So he had an advantage like the Montreal
Canadians getting first pick of every

1572
01:36:27,801 --> 01:36:30,500
French born Canadian fucking player.
Um,

1573
01:36:30,501 --> 01:36:34,610
that's what white people were in Hollywood
back then. Uh, but during this time,

1574
01:36:35,030 --> 01:36:38,300
you know, and this is this, I think this
is really cool that Fred Astaire said,

1575
01:36:38,301 --> 01:36:42,740
this shows you what a cool guy. This
was. This guy was that he gave a,

1576
01:36:44,120 --> 01:36:49,100
he gave a shout out to the uh, Jesus
Christ. Where the fuck's the video?

1577
01:36:49,101 --> 01:36:52,340
Now what did I do? Oh
Christ, what did I do?

1578
01:36:53,690 --> 01:36:57,530
That's not the right one.
That's not the right one.

1579
01:36:59,180 --> 01:37:03,320
As fucking hang on a second.
The hell did I do here?

1580
01:37:04,180 --> 01:37:08,720
All right. Greatest. The Nicholas
Brothers hope I'm saying that right.

1581
01:37:09,170 --> 01:37:12,200
You got to watch this video.
Even if you don't like all those fucking,

1582
01:37:12,201 --> 01:37:13,730
so you think you can dance.

1583
01:37:14,680 --> 01:37:18,380
So you think you can do a split
naviat twat stick to the floor.

1584
01:37:18,590 --> 01:37:22,250
You know when I'll be the judge of that.
If you don't like those fucking shows,

1585
01:37:22,620 --> 01:37:25,850
you got to watch these guys.
These guys are unbelievable.

1586
01:37:25,851 --> 01:37:28,580
It's called the greatest dance
number ever filmed at the beginning.

1587
01:37:28,581 --> 01:37:32,300
You're probably not going to like it.
Cab Calloway's in their scat singing.

1588
01:37:32,330 --> 01:37:35,510
I fucking hate [inaudible]
singing. I, I just don't like it.

1589
01:37:35,690 --> 01:37:40,300
I don't think it's a talent skill.
But at beam apple on abdomen dead baby,

1590
01:37:40,301 --> 01:37:44,930
shut your fucking face. Learn how to
play the trumpet. A shut the fuck up.

1591
01:37:44,931 --> 01:37:49,010
I can't stand it. But at once he's done
and he does his little fucking head bop.

1592
01:37:49,011 --> 01:37:52,490
And I never liked that fucking guy.
I used to like him.

1593
01:37:52,580 --> 01:37:57,300
And one time I read miles
Davis autobiography and he
trashed cab Calloway saying

1594
01:37:57,301 --> 01:38:01,890
that when a is he ratted somebody out for
fucking haven't drugs on him, you know,

1595
01:38:01,950 --> 01:38:06,810
which was basically the jazz musician
version of those fucking assholes who

1596
01:38:06,811 --> 01:38:11,811
ratted out actors for being potentially
members of the Communist Party in the

1597
01:38:11,820 --> 01:38:16,620
50s to Joe McCarthy. So fuck him.
But once he's out of it, all right,

1598
01:38:16,621 --> 01:38:19,800
with this stupid conch, when he gets
the fuck out of the goddamn video,

1599
01:38:20,650 --> 01:38:25,330
watch these two guys. It's unfucking
believable, man. Just the, the,

1600
01:38:25,410 --> 01:38:29,400
the level of talent that these guys have
is insane. All right. And then, you know,

1601
01:38:29,401 --> 01:38:32,940
last week I hiked those videos about
the new planet of the apes moving comic

1602
01:38:32,970 --> 01:38:35,610
movie coming out.
Um,

1603
01:38:35,880 --> 01:38:40,440
people sent in some smart chimp videos.
These things are fucking awesome. Uh,

1604
01:38:40,470 --> 01:38:42,970
one is of a chimp. Uh, they,

1605
01:38:43,360 --> 01:38:47,280
they stick a peanut in the bottom
of this giant graduated cylinder.

1606
01:38:47,340 --> 01:38:48,360
And I gotta be honest with you,

1607
01:38:48,361 --> 01:38:50,580
I couldn't figure out how to get
this fucking thing out of there.

1608
01:38:50,880 --> 01:38:54,150
And this chimp figures it out.
Um,

1609
01:38:54,151 --> 01:38:57,180
I think we're actually going to facilitate
them taking over the planet if we

1610
01:38:57,181 --> 01:39:00,030
keep to keep teaching them this shit.
At the very least,

1611
01:39:00,031 --> 01:39:03,930
being smarter than half the people in
shop class a. Then there's another video,

1612
01:39:04,170 --> 01:39:06,420
another smart chimp trying
to get them to work together.

1613
01:39:06,810 --> 01:39:08,610
Human beings are so fucking stupid.

1614
01:39:08,730 --> 01:39:13,290
The scientists out there trying to get
chimps, trying to get them to help move,

1615
01:39:13,320 --> 01:39:15,600
like move up a heavy piece,

1616
01:39:16,110 --> 01:39:21,110
this heavy rock to get them to learn
how to pull all in the same direction,

1617
01:39:21,180 --> 01:39:24,720
teach them that fucking skill,
you know,

1618
01:39:26,350 --> 01:39:30,570
so right there they can get knee a
bomb shelter back in the day if you,

1619
01:39:30,580 --> 01:39:34,140
if you had all my God, they're the
fucking chimpanzees are gonna rip met my,

1620
01:39:34,260 --> 01:39:36,240
my God damn nuts off and my face off.

1621
01:39:36,241 --> 01:39:39,060
He could go into your bomb shelter
and clothes, that fucking metal.

1622
01:39:40,220 --> 01:39:44,430
They're going to teach them how to open
it up. And then there's the last one.

1623
01:39:44,431 --> 01:39:47,910
Steve Vai Acoustic.
I know you're here and this is a,

1624
01:39:47,911 --> 01:39:52,140
I totally respect Steve Vai.
Um, he's one of those guys who,

1625
01:39:52,141 --> 01:39:54,960
he was a hired gun during the
hair metal days and he survived.

1626
01:39:54,961 --> 01:39:58,330
He carved out his own niche. He never
stopped creating and he goes around,

1627
01:39:58,350 --> 01:40:00,840
he sells out theaters.
He's making his money.

1628
01:40:01,440 --> 01:40:04,950
I told you guys that are my favorite
behind the music of all time was vanilla

1629
01:40:04,951 --> 01:40:08,940
ice because he still had his money. I have
to seeing all those broke down. I mean,

1630
01:40:08,941 --> 01:40:10,890
most of the guys,
a lot of guys still had them money.

1631
01:40:11,390 --> 01:40:14,430
Molly Cruz still had their
money. I liked that one. Um,

1632
01:40:14,520 --> 01:40:16,770
Aerosmith's was great because
they still had them on.

1633
01:40:16,810 --> 01:40:21,660
I just hated seeing the guy I hate.
I hate seeing people fail. I hate it,

1634
01:40:22,530 --> 01:40:26,700
you know, unless it's the Canadians,
the Yankees, the jets or the Lakers.

1635
01:40:28,080 --> 01:40:28,140
Dude,

1636
01:40:28,140 --> 01:40:31,530
if anybody can tell me how the Lakers
aren't going to win the championship this

1637
01:40:31,530 --> 01:40:33,900
year with the fucking old
ass Celtics trading away,

1638
01:40:33,901 --> 01:40:38,220
Kendrick Perkins and the spurs losing to
the Er, the fucking grizzlies. It's over.

1639
01:40:38,400 --> 01:40:43,400
There is no fucking way the Lakers aren't
going to win the championship score.

1640
01:40:43,411 --> 01:40:46,940
Detroit Redwings I'm trying to jinx the
Lakers by saying that cause other than

1641
01:40:46,950 --> 01:40:49,710
that, I don't think there's
anything stopping them. Um,

1642
01:40:51,720 --> 01:40:55,510
so anyways, what the fuck was I talking
about? I totally lost my frame of thought,

1643
01:40:56,350 --> 01:41:01,330
my train of thought or my
frame of reference or in my
world, my frame of thought.

1644
01:41:01,750 --> 01:41:06,290
I'm a fucking moron. Um, the
fuck was he talking about?

1645
01:41:07,840 --> 01:41:08,040
Okay.

1646
01:41:08,040 --> 01:41:10,860
Yeah, it's gone. People, it's gone
forever. That's how my brain works out,

1647
01:41:10,861 --> 01:41:15,630
right in the end of the
podcast, let's, uh, let's hype
my dates. What do I got here?

1648
01:41:15,990 --> 01:41:20,640
Uh, coming up. Oh, by the way, I told
you guys I was doing David Letterman. Um,

1649
01:41:20,670 --> 01:41:23,760
that is not going to be happening
because believe it or not,

1650
01:41:24,570 --> 01:41:29,570
guess who got called back for another
episode of Glee speak in a dancing.

1651
01:41:31,260 --> 01:41:34,410
See what you guys don't realize
is when I sing on the podcast,

1652
01:41:34,411 --> 01:41:35,460
I'm just fucking around.

1653
01:41:35,760 --> 01:41:40,760
I actually have a wonderful
voice and I am a triple threat.

1654
01:41:41,070 --> 01:41:45,940
I can deliver the jokes,
I can sing the songs and I can fucking a,

1655
01:41:45,941 --> 01:41:48,120
I can do a little Shim Sham.
I can dance.

1656
01:41:52,810 --> 01:41:53,643
Yeah.

1657
01:41:53,850 --> 01:41:54,540
Um, yeah. Um,

1658
01:41:54,540 --> 01:41:58,250
that bringing me back to gleek and I'm
actually doing the singing and dance

1659
01:41:58,410 --> 01:41:59,670
number with a,

1660
01:41:59,671 --> 01:42:04,671
that an androgynous kid who hangs out
with that fucking angry blonde chick.

1661
01:42:06,150 --> 01:42:09,300
We're going to be singing a,
I want a new drug,

1662
01:42:09,900 --> 01:42:13,470
but we're doing the club version. So
it's going to be really, really sexy.

1663
01:42:14,360 --> 01:42:18,210
And we wouldn't want to lose a v neck
tee shirts that shows man cleavage.

1664
01:42:19,140 --> 01:42:21,090
It's going to be awesome.
So look for that.

1665
01:42:21,330 --> 01:42:23,280
So I won't be doing
Letterman because of that.

1666
01:42:23,310 --> 01:42:27,490
And also I'm going to be at

for all your tickets and all the links.
Like I said,

1670
01:42:39,271 --> 01:42:41,070
these tickets are selling very fast.

1671
01:42:41,071 --> 01:42:45,210
I don't know how long we're going to be
doing this tour or how long where uh,

1672
01:42:45,450 --> 01:42:48,990
I dunno. That's hilarious. I
basically said what I wanted to say.

1673
01:42:49,320 --> 01:42:52,680
I want to say how long this tour is going
to last or how long we're going to be

1674
01:42:52,681 --> 01:42:53,371
doing this tour.

1675
01:42:53,371 --> 01:42:56,490
And I got right to the second one on my
brain just shuts off cause it works in a

1676
01:42:56,491 --> 01:42:57,900
straight line.
Yeah.

1677
01:42:57,901 --> 01:43:00,510
I don't know how long we're going to be
doing this tour and how long this lineup

1678
01:43:00,511 --> 01:43:01,920
is going to last.
And uh,

1679
01:43:01,980 --> 01:43:05,250
I gotta tell you it's been a long fucking
time since I've been on a show where I

1680
01:43:05,251 --> 01:43:08,640
just stand and I watched the entire show.
I'm a comedian.

1681
01:43:08,641 --> 01:43:13,641
Nothing makes me fucking laugh and I am
working with three fucking base on this

1682
01:43:14,550 --> 01:43:17,820
and uh, it's worth every
God damn sent I guarantee.

1683
01:43:18,240 --> 01:43:23,010
So make sure you get your ass down
there. Um, and other than that,

1684
01:43:23,011 --> 01:43:28,011
I'm going to be doing Caroline's comedy
club May 19th through the 22nd and uh,

1685
01:43:30,120 --> 01:43:33,120
and then the Chicago theater,
another anti social network tour.

1686
01:43:33,540 --> 01:43:36,870
We added Seattle last week and
we're also doing Las Vegas.

1687
01:43:36,900 --> 01:43:40,530
All those dates are up on
antisocial comedy.com and that's it.

1688
01:43:40,680 --> 01:43:44,880

Then you write something nice
in the car and you're all set.

1703
01:44:32,720 --> 01:44:35,990
You don't even have to
leave your fucking house.

1704
01:44:36,860 --> 01:44:38,930
How great is that? You know,
if you, one of these people,

1705
01:44:38,931 --> 01:44:42,440
are you scared of the Internet?
Uh, you like me, you know,

1706
01:44:42,470 --> 01:44:46,160

just call La, there's a one 800 number.

minutes. I still went over. All right.
