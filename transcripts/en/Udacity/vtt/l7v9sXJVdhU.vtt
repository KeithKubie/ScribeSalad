00:00:00.370 --> 00:00:02.250
So there are some important features that we could pick

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:05.770
up on from the genetic code here. The first is

00:00:05.770 --> 00:00:09.330
that some amino acids are coded by multiple codons. In

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:11.850
the answer to the last exercise we sort of explored

00:00:11.850 --> 00:00:14.680
this a little bit and see that alanine is coded

00:00:14.680 --> 00:00:18.950
by GCU, GCC, GCA, GCG. And this happens for some

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:22.350
of the other amino acid as well. Another feature that

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:25.210
some amino acids have only codon that codes for them,

00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:28.530
for example, trip to fan, just as UGG.

00:00:28.530 --> 00:00:30.690
Another feature is that some codons have special

00:00:30.690 --> 00:00:33.530
functions. For example, we see 3 appear UAA,

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:37.240
UAG and UGA code for stop codons, there's no

00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:39.730
amino acid and it seems to signal. The

00:00:39.730 --> 00:00:43.490
stop for translation. And over here, we have one

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:46.350
codon that seems to code for an amino

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:50.520
acid, methionine, but it's also representative of the start.

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:55.620
It appears that there's a start codon. This AUG turns out to be really

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:59.700
important. Because this start codon is necessary

00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:03.360
to start protein synthesis for translation. This

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:06.040
is the codon that tells the ribosome

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:10.330
where to start. Alternatively, these stop codons

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:12.450
are essentially signals that tell the ribosome

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:15.630
where to stop. So now, using the genetic

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:21.140
code here I want to see if you can find the start codon, the stop codon,

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:23.050
and the codon that codes for Alanine, or

00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:28.290
Ala in this following mRNA sequence. There are 3

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:33.010
codons to choose from, AUG, GCA, and UGA.

00:01:33.010 --> 00:01:35.150
And for each of these options' start, I

00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:36.790
want you to pick one of these 3

00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:40.720
check boxes that corresponds with one of these codons.

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:44.040
If you have trouble reading this genetic code right here, just

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:48.070
look in the instructor's notes. Any time you have to use

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:51.030
the genetic code, and I'll always give it to you, or

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:53.960
any question, just look in the instructor's notes, and there'll be

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:56.800
a link right there. You can also download it, keep it

00:01:56.800 --> 00:02:00.110
to yourself, you can Google image search other genetic codes if

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:03.120
you're interested in seeing them, but go ahead and use the

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:06.350
information here to see if you can answer This question and

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:11.050
select the correct codon for start, stop, and Alanine.
