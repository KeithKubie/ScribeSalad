[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:07.460
MYOSHA MCAFEE: So
I'm Myosha McAfee.

00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:10.584
I've been at Google for about
10 months, 10 and a half,

00:00:10.584 --> 00:00:11.750
maybe I'm at that 11th mark.

00:00:11.750 --> 00:00:13.040
I'm not sure yet.

00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:15.470
And I'm a principal
racial equitect.

00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:17.750
Yes, I made that title up.

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:20.159
I love Google because I
get to make up my titles.

00:00:20.159 --> 00:00:22.700
And that essentially means I'm
trained as a social scientist,

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:23.390
a race scholar.

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:25.190
And I am responsible
for figuring

00:00:25.190 --> 00:00:28.400
out how do we grapple with
race and its intersections

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:28.947
as a company?

00:00:28.947 --> 00:00:30.530
And really thinking
about what does it

00:00:30.530 --> 00:00:34.670
look like in the workplace
in a corporation,

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:37.340
even though it's Googley
type of corporation.

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:40.190
And I'm very excited to be
a part of Decoding Race.

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:43.070
This is the seventh
in a 12 part series.

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:45.890
And we wanted to center on
intersectionality today.

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:47.960
Talk about being
more than a woman,

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:51.410
the intersection of race,
gender, and sexual orientation.

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:54.470
And so I want to first
welcome our guests here,

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:55.550
distinguished guests.

00:00:55.550 --> 00:00:57.600
And thank you, Austin,
for having us here.

00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:59.880
First up we have television
and fashion personality,

00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:02.150
EJ Johnson, let's give him
a warm round of welcome.

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:07.730
Next to EJ is Tanzina Veiga.

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:10.500
Tanzina is a national
reporter for "CNN Money,"

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:13.200
where she covers issues of
race inequality in America.

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:17.460
Prior to working at CNN,
Vega was a staff reporter

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:19.680
for "The New York Times,"
where she created a beat--

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:21.930
she created a beat--

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:23.714
covering issues of
race and ethnicity

00:01:23.714 --> 00:01:24.630
for the National Desk.

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:26.925
And it's important to
note, she created a beat.

00:01:26.925 --> 00:01:32.380
[APPLAUSE]

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:36.400
Next to Tanzina is
Dr. Kim Crenshaw.

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:37.010
Woo.

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:40.090
She's a Professor of Law at
UCLA and Columbia Law School,

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:42.580
and a leading scholar in
civil rights, black feminism,

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:43.450
and the law.

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:48.160
She actually coined two terms
that have become essential

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:51.040
in our conversations about race
and its intersections, critical

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:52.414
race theory, if
you've ever heard

00:01:52.414 --> 00:01:54.400
of it, and intersectionality.

00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:57.260
If you're using those words,
she created those words.

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:58.896
Let's give it up
for Dr. Crenshaw.

00:01:58.896 --> 00:02:03.630
[APPLAUSE]

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:07.350
Next to her is Linda Sarsour,
is a Palestinian-American

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:10.229
Muslim scholar, activist,
and media commentator.

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:13.260
She is the Executive Director
of the Arab American Association

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:16.980
of New York, co-founder of the
first Muslim online organizing

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:21.180
platform, Empower Change, and
the co-chair and organizer

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:23.260
of the Women's March in DC.

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:30.440
[APPLAUSE]

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:34.190
So we have some serious,
serious people upfront.

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:36.567
We want to get real
honest, real raw.

00:02:36.567 --> 00:02:38.150
We want to speak our
truths, and we're

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:40.610
hoping that you can bear
witness to this space,

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:43.010
find your own story
in it, and if not,

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:47.930
just hold space with
somebody else's reality here.

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:50.280
First up, we're going to just
start with a big ol' word

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:53.150
intersectionality, and
just break it down.

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:57.410
So we're going to start out
with Kim just breaking it down

00:02:57.410 --> 00:02:58.280
for us.

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:01.370
Because this form was born
out of the late essayist Audre

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:06.080
Lorde's, "there is no such thing
as a single issue struggle,

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:08.830
because we do not live
single issue lives."

00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:10.360
It centers intersectionality.

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:12.110
It's an idea you
introduced and developed,

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:14.840
so let's begin with a
simple breakdown of what

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:17.060
is intersectionality,
how do you define it,

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:19.060
why should we be
talking about it?

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:20.060
KIM CRENSHAW: All right.

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:24.860
So I'll give the
elevator version

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:26.780
and offer some illustrations.

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:30.110
The elevator version
basically is this--

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:32.660
intersectionality
reflects the reality

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:36.470
that systems of subordination--
power, discrimination,

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:40.520
like racism, sexism,
heterosexism, ableism--

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:44.630
are not separate and distinct
forms of discrimination.

00:03:44.630 --> 00:03:46.700
Many times they overlap.

00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:48.080
They interlock.

00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:51.800
They create kinds of
problems and challenges

00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:55.010
that can't be addressed if you
think of these issues as just

00:03:55.010 --> 00:03:56.210
single issues.

00:03:56.210 --> 00:03:58.820
So it's the simple
fact that, if you just

00:03:58.820 --> 00:04:02.480
experience race
discrimination as a woman,

00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:05.150
you're probably experiencing
both race and gender

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:06.950
discrimination.

00:04:06.950 --> 00:04:09.620
And so the simple
version is just

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:12.620
recognizing that there
are multiple forms

00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:13.590
of discrimination.

00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:16.399
Some people are subject
to more than one of them,

00:04:16.399 --> 00:04:20.550
and if your tools that you
have to identify and intervene

00:04:20.550 --> 00:04:22.610
do not focus on
the intersections,

00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:26.270
you're probably not doing
much to alleviate the problem.

00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:28.810
Now that's the elevator version.

00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:33.710
Here is a more, I guess,
narrative version.

00:04:33.710 --> 00:04:36.140
Intersectionality
was basically a term

00:04:36.140 --> 00:04:39.100
that I used to try
to explain a problem.

00:04:39.100 --> 00:04:40.820
It was a problem in a workforce.

00:04:40.820 --> 00:04:43.370
It was a problem
with black women

00:04:43.370 --> 00:04:46.490
who were basically saying that
in the industry that they were

00:04:46.490 --> 00:04:48.080
in, it was the
auto manufacturing

00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:51.020
industry, that they were
being discriminated against.

00:04:51.020 --> 00:04:53.930
They couldn't get hired.

00:04:53.930 --> 00:04:56.090
The problem was
that the courts had

00:04:56.090 --> 00:04:58.490
a version of what race
discrimination looked like

00:04:58.490 --> 00:05:00.680
and it was what
happened to black men.

00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:02.270
And they had a
version of what gender

00:05:02.270 --> 00:05:04.130
discrimination looked
like, and it was

00:05:04.130 --> 00:05:06.140
what happened to white women.

00:05:06.140 --> 00:05:07.700
These black women
were saying, well,

00:05:07.700 --> 00:05:09.440
what happens to
white women and what

00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:12.200
happens to black men
doesn't really tell you much

00:05:12.200 --> 00:05:14.360
about what's happening to us.

00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:17.240
So white women, yes,
they are experiencing

00:05:17.240 --> 00:05:19.220
a form of discrimination here.

00:05:19.220 --> 00:05:23.120
They can't work in any other
place in this industry but as

00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:28.190
a secretary or a receptionist
or a telephone operator.

00:05:28.190 --> 00:05:30.440
The way they experience
gender discrimination

00:05:30.440 --> 00:05:33.020
isn't exactly the same way
that we're experiencing

00:05:33.020 --> 00:05:34.430
gender discrimination.

00:05:34.430 --> 00:05:36.890
They have to work
as secretaries.

00:05:36.890 --> 00:05:39.200
We can't work at all.

00:05:39.200 --> 00:05:41.720
Or they'll say
African-American men are

00:05:41.720 --> 00:05:43.760
experiencing discrimination.

00:05:43.760 --> 00:05:47.150
When they apply here at this
auto manufacturing plant,

00:05:47.150 --> 00:05:51.500
they're only allowed to work
in the front, on the floor,

00:05:51.500 --> 00:05:53.870
in the heavy jobs, in
the dangerous jobs.

00:05:53.870 --> 00:05:55.430
That's discrimination.

00:05:55.430 --> 00:05:57.620
But their discrimination
is not the same as ours,

00:05:57.620 --> 00:06:00.410
because as women, we
can't even get that work.

00:06:00.410 --> 00:06:02.300
So the point of
intersectionality

00:06:02.300 --> 00:06:05.000
was to say, we can
figure this out

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:09.500
if we just use a real common
metaphor, an intersection.

00:06:09.500 --> 00:06:12.650
So some part of the way that
workforce was structured,

00:06:12.650 --> 00:06:15.170
the roads, was a
racial structure.

00:06:15.170 --> 00:06:16.400
Black jobs are here.

00:06:16.400 --> 00:06:18.240
White jobs are here.

00:06:18.240 --> 00:06:21.350
The other part of the structure
was a gender structure.

00:06:21.350 --> 00:06:22.850
Women can work here.

00:06:22.850 --> 00:06:24.890
Women cannot work here.

00:06:24.890 --> 00:06:27.670
If you are a black
person who is a woman,

00:06:27.670 --> 00:06:30.020
you are actually
situated where those two

00:06:30.020 --> 00:06:31.820
policies come together.

00:06:31.820 --> 00:06:35.210
So the traffic, the policy,
the hiring decisions

00:06:35.210 --> 00:06:39.410
that go down the race road
or the gender road actually

00:06:39.410 --> 00:06:42.470
creates an intersection
where those people who

00:06:42.470 --> 00:06:45.440
are black and female are
subject to discrimination.

00:06:45.440 --> 00:06:49.260
So it's not really
a complicated idea,

00:06:49.260 --> 00:06:51.410
but it is one that
requires people

00:06:51.410 --> 00:06:53.540
to understand that
intersectionality is not

00:06:53.540 --> 00:06:55.740
just about identity.

00:06:55.740 --> 00:06:58.820
It's about identity in a context
in which your identity makes

00:06:58.820 --> 00:07:02.030
a difference in your
access to equality

00:07:02.030 --> 00:07:04.289
or your availability
to discrimination.

00:07:04.289 --> 00:07:05.330
MYOSHA MCAFEE: All right.

00:07:05.330 --> 00:07:07.400
So we're going to drill
down a little bit more

00:07:07.400 --> 00:07:10.010
to talk about this
because we want

00:07:10.010 --> 00:07:11.510
to move into our
lived experience,

00:07:11.510 --> 00:07:14.900
not just in the words that kind
of float up here at 50,000 feet

00:07:14.900 --> 00:07:15.975
high level abstract.

00:07:15.975 --> 00:07:17.600
So I want to start
out with you, Linda,

00:07:17.600 --> 00:07:19.225
just talking about
how do you actually,

00:07:19.225 --> 00:07:21.590
how are you living your
intersectional life?

00:07:21.590 --> 00:07:23.330
What are points,
what are contexts

00:07:23.330 --> 00:07:25.520
where you experience
advantages and the context

00:07:25.520 --> 00:07:29.850
where you're experiencing
disadvantages?

00:07:29.850 --> 00:07:32.370
LINDA SARSOUR: Thank you so
much for having me here today.

00:07:32.370 --> 00:07:34.300
I came here from
Brooklyn, New York.

00:07:34.300 --> 00:07:35.210
So I bring a lot.

00:07:35.210 --> 00:07:36.085
No, I'm just kidding.

00:07:36.085 --> 00:07:38.530
[LAUGHTER]

00:07:38.530 --> 00:07:41.640
I think to Dr. Crenshaw's
point and Aydre Lorde,

00:07:41.640 --> 00:07:44.220
I mean it's just so simple,
but yet so profound.

00:07:44.220 --> 00:07:46.062
You know I'm Palestinian.

00:07:46.062 --> 00:07:48.270
I come from a heritage and
a lineage of people living

00:07:48.270 --> 00:07:49.560
under military occupation.

00:07:49.560 --> 00:07:51.360
My parents came here
to live a better life.

00:07:51.360 --> 00:07:52.710
I'm a woman.

00:07:52.710 --> 00:07:54.220
I'm a woman of color.

00:07:54.220 --> 00:07:56.940
I'm an activist, a
political activist.

00:07:56.940 --> 00:07:57.660
I'm a parent.

00:07:57.660 --> 00:08:00.870
I'm a young mom, had my first
kid when I was 17 years old.

00:08:00.870 --> 00:08:02.790
So I bring a lot to the table.

00:08:02.790 --> 00:08:04.770
And I want to be treated
as a whole person.

00:08:04.770 --> 00:08:07.230
And my lived experience as
someone who's a Muslim woman

00:08:07.230 --> 00:08:09.720
is that there have been people
who, just the minute they

00:08:09.720 --> 00:08:12.990
see me, they have already
preconceived what my story is

00:08:12.990 --> 00:08:14.910
and how I got to where I got to.

00:08:14.910 --> 00:08:16.500
And I think that,
and I'll give you

00:08:16.500 --> 00:08:19.110
an example of what
intersectionality, how

00:08:19.110 --> 00:08:20.040
it actually plays out.

00:08:20.040 --> 00:08:21.750
Because again, it's
not complicated.

00:08:21.750 --> 00:08:22.890
But it requires work.

00:08:22.890 --> 00:08:24.960
So I was one of the
co-chairs of the Women's

00:08:24.960 --> 00:08:25.860
March on Washington.

00:08:25.860 --> 00:08:27.840
And originally it started
as the women's rights

00:08:27.840 --> 00:08:28.860
are human rights, right?

00:08:28.860 --> 00:08:31.140
And it started the
first three days

00:08:31.140 --> 00:08:33.182
by well-intentioned
white women who

00:08:33.182 --> 00:08:34.890
were like women's
rights are human rights

00:08:34.890 --> 00:08:37.241
and reproductive rights and
Planned Parenthood and all

00:08:37.241 --> 00:08:37.740
this stuff.

00:08:37.740 --> 00:08:39.659
And when women of color
came to the table,

00:08:39.659 --> 00:08:43.470
we were like, hold
on a second here, no.

00:08:43.470 --> 00:08:45.774
We can't go to
the table as women

00:08:45.774 --> 00:08:47.190
and talk about
reproductive rights

00:08:47.190 --> 00:08:48.794
and leave out every
other issue that

00:08:48.794 --> 00:08:50.460
needs to be brought
to the table because

00:08:50.460 --> 00:08:55.800
as an Arab-American Muslim
woman, a Chicano Mexican

00:08:55.800 --> 00:08:58.270
woman, Carmen Perez and
me, we were like, no, no.

00:08:58.270 --> 00:09:00.270
You can't talk about
women's reproductive rights

00:09:00.270 --> 00:09:02.270
without talking about
race and class and access.

00:09:02.270 --> 00:09:06.150
You can't talk about
women's reproductive rights

00:09:06.150 --> 00:09:09.690
without talking about race
or about racial justice

00:09:09.690 --> 00:09:11.190
and criminal justice.

00:09:11.190 --> 00:09:14.100
And if we win justice, and we
don't have a planet to live on,

00:09:14.100 --> 00:09:15.600
like it just all
kind of intersects.

00:09:15.600 --> 00:09:19.140
So people thought it was great,
and you got to the march,

00:09:19.140 --> 00:09:20.640
and it was like
oh, so inspiring.

00:09:20.640 --> 00:09:22.223
But in fact, the
process getting there

00:09:22.223 --> 00:09:24.960
was not that inspiring
often, because it required

00:09:24.960 --> 00:09:27.150
us being able to say
that we are whole people,

00:09:27.150 --> 00:09:28.440
and we come from mixed--

00:09:28.440 --> 00:09:29.940
I come from a mixed
status family.

00:09:29.940 --> 00:09:31.980
I have people in my family
who are undocumented.

00:09:31.980 --> 00:09:33.580
I've got to talk
about them, too.

00:09:33.580 --> 00:09:35.319
I come from the racial
justice movement.

00:09:35.319 --> 00:09:37.110
And I want to talk, I
want to say her name.

00:09:37.110 --> 00:09:39.335
You know, I want to be
able to say Black Lives

00:09:39.335 --> 00:09:41.460
Matter on the stage, and
being able to teach people

00:09:41.460 --> 00:09:44.910
that we have enough of a big
heart and enough of intellect

00:09:44.910 --> 00:09:47.460
for me to be able to say
Black Lives Matter, justice

00:09:47.460 --> 00:09:50.100
for immigrants, justice
for LGBTQI people,

00:09:50.100 --> 00:09:52.530
religious freedom,
whatever, all together, like

00:09:52.530 --> 00:09:53.680
we could do that.

00:09:53.680 --> 00:09:56.270
And that's for me what
intersectionality is at play,

00:09:56.270 --> 00:09:58.410
that we welcome people
with all their complexities

00:09:58.410 --> 00:09:58.800
to the table.

00:09:58.800 --> 00:10:00.758
We don't allow people to
leave any part of them

00:10:00.758 --> 00:10:03.540
out because it's not convenient
for the work or the movement

00:10:03.540 --> 00:10:05.759
or for quote 'social
justice' that everyone comes

00:10:05.759 --> 00:10:07.050
to the table within everything.

00:10:07.050 --> 00:10:10.560
If you don't accept all of me as
an intersectional human being,

00:10:10.560 --> 00:10:12.660
then that's not the space
that I want to be in.

00:10:12.660 --> 00:10:12.960
MYOSHA MCAFEE: Thank you.

00:10:12.960 --> 00:10:15.043
We want to keep it personal,
local, and immediate.

00:10:15.043 --> 00:10:16.590
Tanzina, you want
to step in, talk

00:10:16.590 --> 00:10:19.500
about how you're living
an intersectional life.

00:10:19.500 --> 00:10:21.900
TANZINA VEGA: So my
intersectionality, I guess,

00:10:21.900 --> 00:10:24.900
would be described as I'm a
Puerto Rican woman, Latina,

00:10:24.900 --> 00:10:26.580
but specifically
Puerto Rican I think.

00:10:26.580 --> 00:10:29.550
And I say that because the
conversations around Latinos

00:10:29.550 --> 00:10:32.490
today I think are very narrow
in the way we look at it.

00:10:32.490 --> 00:10:33.630
Everybody's an immigrant.

00:10:33.630 --> 00:10:35.210
Everybody's a Mexican.

00:10:35.210 --> 00:10:36.210
Everybody just got here.

00:10:36.210 --> 00:10:37.770
That's not the case.

00:10:37.770 --> 00:10:39.600
In many cases it is,
and I have the numbers

00:10:39.600 --> 00:10:41.400
if you want to dig
deeper into that,

00:10:41.400 --> 00:10:43.740
but I'd like to also
showcase that there

00:10:43.740 --> 00:10:47.340
are different types of
Latinidad, is what we call it.

00:10:47.340 --> 00:10:51.750
And so by definition that
makes me racially a very

00:10:51.750 --> 00:10:53.970
mixed and diverse person.

00:10:53.970 --> 00:10:55.560
There are black
people in my family,

00:10:55.560 --> 00:10:59.970
there are people who have Taino
blood, which is the Indians who

00:10:59.970 --> 00:11:01.590
were on the island
of Puerto Rico,

00:11:01.590 --> 00:11:04.840
and obviously there's white
European blood there as well.

00:11:04.840 --> 00:11:07.950
Which is why I am sort of
ambiguously ethnic to a lot

00:11:07.950 --> 00:11:09.090
of people when they see me.

00:11:09.090 --> 00:11:12.536
They know I'm not white,
but they know I'm not black.

00:11:12.536 --> 00:11:14.160
Actually I had a
student in South Korea

00:11:14.160 --> 00:11:16.649
once say to me, when I
was teaching ESL there,

00:11:16.649 --> 00:11:18.690
said teacher, you're not
white, you're not black.

00:11:18.690 --> 00:11:19.740
What are you?

00:11:19.740 --> 00:11:24.149
And I was like, that's another
two hours that we get to kill.

00:11:24.149 --> 00:11:25.440
But it was a poignant question.

00:11:25.440 --> 00:11:27.640
I mean we're in this
tiny town in South Korea.

00:11:27.640 --> 00:11:30.660
This was in 2002.

00:11:30.660 --> 00:11:32.400
And so they didn't
have a lot of exposure

00:11:32.400 --> 00:11:34.410
to anything other
than mainstream media.

00:11:34.410 --> 00:11:37.620
And mainstream media, as someone
that works in the mainstream

00:11:37.620 --> 00:11:39.300
media now, that
wasn't always the path

00:11:39.300 --> 00:11:40.800
that I thought I
was going to be on.

00:11:40.800 --> 00:11:43.800
And the images that we get
of who we are from mainstream

00:11:43.800 --> 00:11:46.500
media, for me growing
up as a Latina,

00:11:46.500 --> 00:11:49.290
as a Puerto Rican woman,
but also as a working

00:11:49.290 --> 00:11:50.940
class and poor family.

00:11:50.940 --> 00:11:54.360
I lived in public housing
for the first 20, 21

00:11:54.360 --> 00:11:55.090
years of my life.

00:11:55.090 --> 00:11:58.222
So right there, if I say,
I grew up in the projects.

00:11:58.222 --> 00:12:00.180
Think about what's in
your mind right now, what

00:12:00.180 --> 00:12:01.266
you're imagining.

00:12:01.266 --> 00:12:02.640
If I hadn't said
that, and I just

00:12:02.640 --> 00:12:05.940
sat here and said "New
York Times," CNN, traveled

00:12:05.940 --> 00:12:09.510
the world, taught in South
Korea, like your image of me

00:12:09.510 --> 00:12:11.940
is very different probably
than what you have in your mind

00:12:11.940 --> 00:12:15.180
right now if I say I spent 21
years in the projects, right?

00:12:15.180 --> 00:12:18.440
Now it's like, oh, OK,
that's a change, right?

00:12:18.440 --> 00:12:20.400
But that's a core identity.

00:12:20.400 --> 00:12:22.480
That's a core part of who I am.

00:12:22.480 --> 00:12:25.500
But also in the conversations
around intersectionality,

00:12:25.500 --> 00:12:27.620
we often forget about class.

00:12:27.620 --> 00:12:30.540
I think class is one of the
most underrepresented parts

00:12:30.540 --> 00:12:33.120
of the conversation, and
an area that so many of us

00:12:33.120 --> 00:12:37.150
can connect on and we
tend to not do that.

00:12:37.150 --> 00:12:39.340
And I say, and of
course, I'm a woman.

00:12:39.340 --> 00:12:42.000
I'm a heterosexual woman so
that presents its own set

00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:45.330
of challenges in many cases.

00:12:45.330 --> 00:12:48.400
And I'm a woman of a certain
age, I won't say where,

00:12:48.400 --> 00:12:52.650
but probably a little
older than a couple of you.

00:12:52.650 --> 00:12:55.485
And so all of these
things are connected,

00:12:55.485 --> 00:12:56.670
and none of these things.

00:12:56.670 --> 00:12:59.040
But yet growing up,
there was never really

00:12:59.040 --> 00:13:01.320
a space for people like me.

00:13:01.320 --> 00:13:03.482
And when Kim and I were
talking before we got here,

00:13:03.482 --> 00:13:05.190
I said one of my goals
is to really start

00:13:05.190 --> 00:13:07.349
to create more spaces--

00:13:07.349 --> 00:13:08.640
oops, sorry, there's my water--

00:13:08.640 --> 00:13:11.880
where people who were
living these sorts

00:13:11.880 --> 00:13:14.550
of intersectional lives can
come together, where you see

00:13:14.550 --> 00:13:16.590
yourself reflected.

00:13:16.590 --> 00:13:18.160
So I said I grew
up in the projects.

00:13:18.160 --> 00:13:21.222
Everybody probably has an image
of what that looks like, right?

00:13:21.222 --> 00:13:21.930
Well, guess what?

00:13:21.930 --> 00:13:23.638
There are also people
in the projects who

00:13:23.638 --> 00:13:26.190
work every day
and raise families

00:13:26.190 --> 00:13:29.610
and aren't drug addicted
or any other thing.

00:13:29.610 --> 00:13:32.280
But there are lots
of pathologies that

00:13:32.280 --> 00:13:33.810
also happen in public housing.

00:13:33.810 --> 00:13:36.390
So being able to survive
that was one thing,

00:13:36.390 --> 00:13:39.720
but being able to also not get
involved in that lifestyle,

00:13:39.720 --> 00:13:42.190
you didn't really
feel like I fit there.

00:13:42.190 --> 00:13:45.690
But I didn't necessarily
fit in certain other areas.

00:13:45.690 --> 00:13:49.860
And when it came to being a
feminist, which I define myself

00:13:49.860 --> 00:13:51.870
as, that was also something
that was like, whoa,

00:13:51.870 --> 00:13:55.140
this is a really
white conversation

00:13:55.140 --> 00:13:58.740
that really tends to be
led by white wealthy,

00:13:58.740 --> 00:14:01.539
or women of means, educated
white women of means.

00:14:01.539 --> 00:14:03.330
So while I believed in
a lot of the tenets,

00:14:03.330 --> 00:14:06.220
I felt like that conversation
was very limited.

00:14:06.220 --> 00:14:09.960
And it did not
embrace the totality

00:14:09.960 --> 00:14:11.880
of who I am as a
person, of what I

00:14:11.880 --> 00:14:14.490
have to deal with as a woman
of color, of what I have

00:14:14.490 --> 00:14:16.800
to deal with as a woman who
came from a working class

00:14:16.800 --> 00:14:17.820
background.

00:14:17.820 --> 00:14:19.280
And so there are so many of--

00:14:19.280 --> 00:14:22.140
and believe me, I traveled the
world for four years on my own.

00:14:22.140 --> 00:14:24.640
There weren't a lot of people
that looked like me out there.

00:14:24.640 --> 00:14:25.890
This whole backpacking thing?

00:14:25.890 --> 00:14:29.057
That was a very white thing
to do back in the day.

00:14:29.057 --> 00:14:30.390
Everybody was like what do you--

00:14:30.390 --> 00:14:30.890
what?

00:14:30.890 --> 00:14:32.440
You don't even know
anybody in China?

00:14:32.440 --> 00:14:33.840
No, but I'm out.

00:14:33.840 --> 00:14:36.650
And then even being in
China was like what?

00:14:36.650 --> 00:14:38.100
Like you're not blond?

00:14:38.100 --> 00:14:39.740
People who just didn't get it.

00:14:39.740 --> 00:14:41.520
And I mean, it was an
amazing experience.

00:14:41.520 --> 00:14:43.330
But it also shows
the limitations

00:14:43.330 --> 00:14:47.310
to how we as Americans
define who we are and really

00:14:47.310 --> 00:14:50.500
take into account the different
layers that each of us has.

00:14:50.500 --> 00:14:53.580
And all of those things, how am
I living my intersectionality,

00:14:53.580 --> 00:14:56.580
well, I'm living it by doing it.

00:14:56.580 --> 00:14:58.050
If any of you follow
me on Twitter,

00:14:58.050 --> 00:15:00.630
I'm very vocal about
issues of diversity,

00:15:00.630 --> 00:15:03.720
particularly in the industry
that I work in, which is media.

00:15:03.720 --> 00:15:07.480
But I also created
content around this issue.

00:15:07.480 --> 00:15:11.250
And whether it's media
representation or inequality,

00:15:11.250 --> 00:15:12.930
that's my contribution to it.

00:15:12.930 --> 00:15:15.626
But it comes from a place of
real experience and personal

00:15:15.626 --> 00:15:16.500
and lived experience.

00:15:16.500 --> 00:15:18.627
So I hope that
answered your question.

00:15:18.627 --> 00:15:19.460
MYOSHA MCAFEE: Yeah.

00:15:19.460 --> 00:15:20.440
It's Your story.

00:15:20.440 --> 00:15:21.380
You tell it how you
want to tell it.

00:15:21.380 --> 00:15:21.900
TANZINA VEGA: And I could go on.

00:15:21.900 --> 00:15:23.608
MYOSHA MCAFEE: All
right, EJ, [INAUDIBLE]

00:15:23.608 --> 00:15:26.300
us a personal look [INAUDIBLE].

00:15:26.300 --> 00:15:29.960
EJ JOHNSON: Yeah, well, I will
say that my personal experience

00:15:29.960 --> 00:15:32.160
is just a lot of ups and downs.

00:15:32.160 --> 00:15:37.350
A lot of almost
contradictions really.

00:15:37.350 --> 00:15:40.720
I am a black male.

00:15:40.720 --> 00:15:44.310
I'm part of the LGBTQ
community as well.

00:15:44.310 --> 00:15:49.860
But also I had to learn about--

00:15:49.860 --> 00:15:53.240
my struggles were different
from a lot of other people's

00:15:53.240 --> 00:15:55.740
growing up, like not only do I
have to deal with black male,

00:15:55.740 --> 00:15:58.830
but now, oh, my god, I'm gay.

00:15:58.830 --> 00:15:59.820
What do I do?

00:15:59.820 --> 00:16:06.330
So at the same time, I came
from a privileged family.

00:16:06.330 --> 00:16:10.740
So I didn't necessarily have
to deal with the race card

00:16:10.740 --> 00:16:12.125
the first thing on the table.

00:16:12.125 --> 00:16:14.250
But you know, it's something
that my parents always

00:16:14.250 --> 00:16:16.458
taught me, like this is what
our people went through.

00:16:16.458 --> 00:16:18.450
This is what you
may face one day.

00:16:18.450 --> 00:16:21.060
And eventually I had
to see that for myself.

00:16:21.060 --> 00:16:23.760
And then growing up
and then finding out,

00:16:23.760 --> 00:16:28.110
holy crap, I'm different
again, here I am being gay

00:16:28.110 --> 00:16:29.370
and gender fluid.

00:16:29.370 --> 00:16:30.750
So now what do I do?

00:16:30.750 --> 00:16:32.640
So that was a whole
other experience for me.

00:16:32.640 --> 00:16:35.730
And just because someone
might look at me,

00:16:35.730 --> 00:16:38.160
and just, oh, well,
look at this queen go.

00:16:38.160 --> 00:16:40.791
You have it all, or you're
wearing fancy clothes

00:16:40.791 --> 00:16:41.790
and doing this and that.

00:16:41.790 --> 00:16:44.247
But I have my own struggles.

00:16:44.247 --> 00:16:46.080
And I think that that's
what the great thing

00:16:46.080 --> 00:16:48.210
about this
intersectionality thing is

00:16:48.210 --> 00:16:54.390
is just that we are all part of
so many different communities,

00:16:54.390 --> 00:16:58.800
and they come together in
ways that might be daunting

00:16:58.800 --> 00:17:02.520
and but at the same
time are also beautiful.

00:17:02.520 --> 00:17:06.630
But I think that the thing is
it's so hard to not put people

00:17:06.630 --> 00:17:09.690
in boxes and just look at
one struggle or one thing

00:17:09.690 --> 00:17:11.068
that somebody else is doing.

00:17:11.068 --> 00:17:12.359
You have to look at everything.

00:17:12.359 --> 00:17:15.270
And a lot of the times that
person has to tell you,

00:17:15.270 --> 00:17:18.415
and you have to just
really listen to them

00:17:18.415 --> 00:17:20.790
and listen to their stories
and listen to their struggles

00:17:20.790 --> 00:17:23.130
to understand what's going
on in their mind, what's

00:17:23.130 --> 00:17:24.480
going on in their life.

00:17:24.480 --> 00:17:27.459
And that's really where
I think that we're

00:17:27.459 --> 00:17:29.250
getting rid of that
kind of discrimination.

00:17:29.250 --> 00:17:31.420
We're really listening
to and looking

00:17:31.420 --> 00:17:35.980
at all the different sections
that that person is in.

00:17:35.980 --> 00:17:39.280
And for me personally,
it was just

00:17:39.280 --> 00:17:40.600
a lot of ups and downs for me.

00:17:40.600 --> 00:17:45.070
I thought, OK, I'm not really
dealing with this race thing,

00:17:45.070 --> 00:17:47.620
but now people are staring
because of the way I dress.

00:17:47.620 --> 00:17:48.880
People are staring
because I'm holding hands

00:17:48.880 --> 00:17:49.810
with some other boy.

00:17:49.810 --> 00:17:52.480
People are making comments
or snickering to me

00:17:52.480 --> 00:17:54.190
and talking to me
on social media.

00:17:54.190 --> 00:17:57.850
And there's just
so much pressure.

00:17:57.850 --> 00:18:00.520
And especially after I
had a public coming out,

00:18:00.520 --> 00:18:03.460
which most people don't
have to deal with.

00:18:03.460 --> 00:18:05.770
That's really when you
know the red flags raised

00:18:05.770 --> 00:18:08.929
for me, that I have to be here.

00:18:08.929 --> 00:18:10.970
I have to stand my ground,
because not everyone's

00:18:10.970 --> 00:18:12.220
going to have my back.

00:18:12.220 --> 00:18:15.520
And I tried not to read a lot
of the things that people wrote

00:18:15.520 --> 00:18:18.130
about me or said,
but at the same time,

00:18:18.130 --> 00:18:19.679
it cannot be ignored.

00:18:19.679 --> 00:18:21.720
And of course, it stemmed
from a lot of ignorance

00:18:21.720 --> 00:18:22.870
and a lot of hate.

00:18:22.870 --> 00:18:27.370
But I just had to stay
true to who I was.

00:18:27.370 --> 00:18:28.630
I wasn't changing.

00:18:28.630 --> 00:18:32.842
And I'm never going to not be
me just because some sad woman

00:18:32.842 --> 00:18:33.550
in her basement--

00:18:33.550 --> 00:18:34.060
[LAUGHTER]

00:18:34.060 --> 00:18:36.430
--wants to come for me.

00:18:36.430 --> 00:18:43.600
But the point is it
was a lot to deal

00:18:43.600 --> 00:18:46.420
with at the time, because I
was still relatively young.

00:18:46.420 --> 00:18:49.780
And at the same time, I
just had to understand

00:18:49.780 --> 00:18:53.660
where that type of
ignorance was coming from.

00:18:53.660 --> 00:18:56.590
And that for the time being,
it's not going to change.

00:18:56.590 --> 00:18:58.180
That people can be
nice to your face

00:18:58.180 --> 00:19:01.000
and people can give you hugs
and be like oh yes, yes, yes.

00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:02.800
But you don't really
know what they're

00:19:02.800 --> 00:19:05.049
going home and saying about
you or what they're doing.

00:19:05.049 --> 00:19:08.320
And you have to really
do that extra work

00:19:08.320 --> 00:19:11.320
to make sure that those people
know that they can't break you

00:19:11.320 --> 00:19:14.800
down, and also, too, you bring
all your communities together

00:19:14.800 --> 00:19:18.310
and uplift that type of
hatred, because that's

00:19:18.310 --> 00:19:20.560
where we're kind of
moving but we need

00:19:20.560 --> 00:19:22.090
to keep that momentum going.

00:19:22.090 --> 00:19:23.710
Because it's going
to be extremely

00:19:23.710 --> 00:19:25.667
important for the future.

00:19:25.667 --> 00:19:26.890
MYOSHA MCAFEE: Thank you.

00:19:26.890 --> 00:19:29.730
So now I want to go back to
the organizing of the Women's

00:19:29.730 --> 00:19:30.230
March.

00:19:30.230 --> 00:19:32.890
And you were like at the
end there was some glory,

00:19:32.890 --> 00:19:34.920
but on the way there
were some challenges.

00:19:34.920 --> 00:19:36.670
LINDA SARSOUR: There's
not a lot of glory.

00:19:36.670 --> 00:19:38.045
MYOSHA MCAFEE: I
think when we're

00:19:38.045 --> 00:19:40.750
trying to figure out how
do we design solutions

00:19:40.750 --> 00:19:43.030
or how do I as an
individual, I as a team,

00:19:43.030 --> 00:19:45.662
begin to actually apply
intersectional frameworks.

00:19:45.662 --> 00:19:47.620
And one thing that I
think is a common practice

00:19:47.620 --> 00:19:50.124
that we grapple with here is
as soon as we start centering

00:19:50.124 --> 00:19:51.790
marginalized communities,
whether that's

00:19:51.790 --> 00:19:54.840
black folks or queer
folks or poor folks,

00:19:54.840 --> 00:19:56.950
people of the more privileged
class start looking

00:19:56.950 --> 00:19:59.530
for the side of their identity
that has disadvantage,

00:19:59.530 --> 00:20:00.572
and like what about this?

00:20:00.572 --> 00:20:01.905
Why can't this be at the center?

00:20:01.905 --> 00:20:03.006
So I'll give one example.

00:20:03.006 --> 00:20:04.130
We want to talk about race.

00:20:04.130 --> 00:20:06.090
There are people like
let's talk about gender.

00:20:06.090 --> 00:20:08.530
And it's a constant like,
let's make this a single issue.

00:20:08.530 --> 00:20:10.580
Let's put them in
competition with each other.

00:20:10.580 --> 00:20:12.440
And so I'm curious
about what it'd

00:20:12.440 --> 00:20:14.805
mean to have a march that
started out with white women

00:20:14.805 --> 00:20:15.670
as organizers.

00:20:15.670 --> 00:20:17.080
I know there was an incredible
amount of conversation

00:20:17.080 --> 00:20:18.790
about where the women of
color, were women of color

00:20:18.790 --> 00:20:20.123
even going to attend this event.

00:20:20.123 --> 00:20:22.930
But once you guys all
decided to come on board,

00:20:22.930 --> 00:20:24.130
what was the conversation?

00:20:24.130 --> 00:20:25.510
Like how did the
agenda have to shift,

00:20:25.510 --> 00:20:27.220
how did certain
practices have to shift,

00:20:27.220 --> 00:20:28.450
what did white
women in particular,

00:20:28.450 --> 00:20:30.525
what new role did they have
to take on, what new frame

00:20:30.525 --> 00:20:33.130
works did they have to walk in,
and then women of color, what

00:20:33.130 --> 00:20:35.960
was their difference that
they had to engage with?

00:20:35.960 --> 00:20:38.210
LINDA SARSOUR: So when the
Women's March on Washington

00:20:38.210 --> 00:20:40.668
was originally announced, it
was the Million Women's March.

00:20:40.668 --> 00:20:43.450
And we were like,
educational moment.

00:20:43.450 --> 00:20:45.280
There was already a
Million Women's March.

00:20:45.280 --> 00:20:47.140
And I will say this in
just a little credit

00:20:47.140 --> 00:20:50.710
to those particular white
women is that they really

00:20:50.710 --> 00:20:52.674
didn't know, they had no idea.

00:20:52.674 --> 00:20:55.090
So they changed the name, and
we went to the Women's March

00:20:55.090 --> 00:20:56.464
on Washington,
with the blessings

00:20:56.464 --> 00:20:58.919
of Bernice King, who's Dr.
Martin Luther King's daughter.

00:20:58.919 --> 00:21:01.210
There was always conversations
that were happening even

00:21:01.210 --> 00:21:03.130
when we took on that name.

00:21:03.130 --> 00:21:05.380
And the skepticism that was
coming from women of color

00:21:05.380 --> 00:21:07.540
was welcomed, because we were
the skeptical women of color,

00:21:07.540 --> 00:21:09.430
too, that ended up
being part of the March.

00:21:09.430 --> 00:21:14.440
But I will say this, we were
not about to allow white women

00:21:14.440 --> 00:21:18.580
to have a national march
where they were going

00:21:18.580 --> 00:21:22.289
to set the agenda for women
nationally and not have women

00:21:22.289 --> 00:21:23.830
of color as part of
the conversation,

00:21:23.830 --> 00:21:25.663
like we were just not
going let that happen.

00:21:25.663 --> 00:21:28.180
So we took one for the team.

00:21:28.180 --> 00:21:31.330
And what happened during
the organizing of the March

00:21:31.330 --> 00:21:32.620
was that--

00:21:32.620 --> 00:21:34.630
so I remember a "New
York Times" reporter

00:21:34.630 --> 00:21:37.300
who wrote a story about
this where she was basically

00:21:37.300 --> 00:21:40.180
trolling the Women's March
on Washington Facebook page.

00:21:40.180 --> 00:21:42.977
And she saw a lot of
divisive, tense conversations

00:21:42.977 --> 00:21:45.310
that were happening about why
we were talking about race

00:21:45.310 --> 00:21:48.010
and why we were kind of
pushing this conversation.

00:21:48.010 --> 00:21:50.800
And she asked this
question, and she said,

00:21:50.800 --> 00:21:52.750
do you think this is
going to hurt the March?

00:21:52.750 --> 00:21:54.583
Who is doing your social
media and whatever?

00:21:54.583 --> 00:21:55.750
And I was like, hold up.

00:21:55.750 --> 00:21:58.300
This is not an accident.

00:21:58.300 --> 00:22:00.760
These conversations that
we're creating about race

00:22:00.760 --> 00:22:01.660
are by design.

00:22:01.660 --> 00:22:03.820
Like we were pushing those
conversations forward,

00:22:03.820 --> 00:22:05.470
the way our social
media was talking

00:22:05.470 --> 00:22:07.780
about the issues in an
intersectional manner

00:22:07.780 --> 00:22:09.550
was designed that way.

00:22:09.550 --> 00:22:13.090
And was it because we wanted
to create divisiveness?

00:22:13.090 --> 00:22:15.220
That divisiveness had
nothing to do with us.

00:22:15.220 --> 00:22:17.140
It had to do with the
people who were feeling

00:22:17.140 --> 00:22:19.024
like there were some sort of--

00:22:19.024 --> 00:22:21.190
they were offended by
something that they themselves

00:22:21.190 --> 00:22:24.290
hadn't grappled with
as mostly white women.

00:22:24.290 --> 00:22:26.137
So if I'm talking
to you about, you

00:22:26.137 --> 00:22:27.720
want to talk about
pay equity, but you

00:22:27.720 --> 00:22:30.320
don't want me to say you
may be a white woman not

00:22:30.320 --> 00:22:32.030
getting the same pay as a man.

00:22:32.030 --> 00:22:34.190
But black and Latino
and other women of color

00:22:34.190 --> 00:22:36.080
are not getting paid
the same amount as you,

00:22:36.080 --> 00:22:37.700
and you don't want me
to talk about that,

00:22:37.700 --> 00:22:39.200
then you ain't
really in this forum.

00:22:39.200 --> 00:22:41.564
And if you are offended
enough that you

00:22:41.564 --> 00:22:42.980
don't want to come
to the March, I

00:22:42.980 --> 00:22:45.590
think that March is going
to be just fine without you.

00:22:45.590 --> 00:22:47.090
And then the other
conversation that

00:22:47.090 --> 00:22:49.006
came up that was really
interesting in the way

00:22:49.006 --> 00:22:50.880
that we think about
are we in this together

00:22:50.880 --> 00:22:53.540
was a lot of controversy
around this idea why we didn't

00:22:53.540 --> 00:22:55.400
like highlight Hillary Clinton.

00:22:55.400 --> 00:22:57.740
Like why wasn't Hillary
Clinton like our poster

00:22:57.740 --> 00:22:59.540
child for the Women's
March on Washington?

00:22:59.540 --> 00:23:01.954
Clearly, I got 20
reasons why personally,

00:23:01.954 --> 00:23:03.620
why she wasn't my
poster child, but I'll

00:23:03.620 --> 00:23:04.940
leave that to the side.

00:23:04.940 --> 00:23:06.710
But this idea that
people actually

00:23:06.710 --> 00:23:10.580
thought that we would take a
privileged, multimillionaire

00:23:10.580 --> 00:23:13.429
rich white lady that
has a dynasty to be

00:23:13.429 --> 00:23:14.720
the face of the Women's March--

00:23:14.720 --> 00:23:19.100
are you out of your mind is
my personal response to that.

00:23:19.100 --> 00:23:23.330
But it was really a
lot of opportunities

00:23:23.330 --> 00:23:26.304
to have what Carmen Perez
calls courageous conversations.

00:23:26.304 --> 00:23:28.220
This is the reason why
we preach to the choir,

00:23:28.220 --> 00:23:30.220
because we only want to
talk to people that only

00:23:30.220 --> 00:23:31.577
agree with what we have to say.

00:23:31.577 --> 00:23:33.410
And I say to women of
color and many of them

00:23:33.410 --> 00:23:35.840
are people that I only mostly
organize with women of color

00:23:35.840 --> 00:23:36.980
is that I get it.

00:23:36.980 --> 00:23:39.010
I'm with you,
pain, trauma, we're

00:23:39.010 --> 00:23:40.760
tired of having to
explain to white people

00:23:40.760 --> 00:23:43.250
why they got to be in
the way that we want to,

00:23:43.250 --> 00:23:45.440
but we are at a moment
right now in this country,

00:23:45.440 --> 00:23:46.790
we're all in this together.

00:23:46.790 --> 00:23:48.590
We're living under
fascism right now.

00:23:48.590 --> 00:23:50.870
And in order for us to
defeat fascism or at least

00:23:50.870 --> 00:23:53.460
survive under fascism, we've
got to be in this together.

00:23:53.460 --> 00:23:58.520
So being able to take a little
extra time to be like, oh, OK.

00:23:58.520 --> 00:23:59.264
What about this?

00:23:59.264 --> 00:23:59.930
What about this?

00:23:59.930 --> 00:24:00.467
Read this.

00:24:00.467 --> 00:24:03.050
Did you ever read this Book did
you read Dr. Kimberley's book?

00:24:03.050 --> 00:24:03.800
Did you read that?

00:24:03.800 --> 00:24:06.870
And for people to
actually say I will.

00:24:06.870 --> 00:24:08.870
And that's the people
that we were working with.

00:24:08.870 --> 00:24:11.453
People who genuinely just never
organize a day in their lives.

00:24:11.453 --> 00:24:15.050
Like for example, Bob Bland, one
of the four national co-chairs

00:24:15.050 --> 00:24:16.220
is a fashion entrepreneur.

00:24:16.220 --> 00:24:17.320
That's what she
does for a living.

00:24:17.320 --> 00:24:19.790
She don't really need to be an
activist, although I realize

00:24:19.790 --> 00:24:21.330
that she was in her own way.

00:24:21.330 --> 00:24:22.970
She does ethical manufacturing.

00:24:22.970 --> 00:24:27.064
So her job is she incubates
fashion lines ethically

00:24:27.064 --> 00:24:28.730
and within the United
States of America.

00:24:28.730 --> 00:24:31.190
So I was like do you know that
that's a form of activism?

00:24:31.190 --> 00:24:33.620
So in fact, there are women
who had different things

00:24:33.620 --> 00:24:35.930
that they cared about that
they were able to bring.

00:24:35.930 --> 00:24:39.620
One of them is a woman by
the name of Brianne Butler.

00:24:39.620 --> 00:24:41.120
Brianne Butler was a baker.

00:24:41.120 --> 00:24:42.470
She bakes cakes for a living.

00:24:42.470 --> 00:24:44.576
Like the Women's March
was also an opportunity

00:24:44.576 --> 00:24:45.950
to bring ordinary
people that are

00:24:45.950 --> 00:24:48.350
not activists and in organizing
spaces and bringing them

00:24:48.350 --> 00:24:50.150
to the table and saying
what talents do you have?

00:24:50.150 --> 00:24:51.260
What do you care about?

00:24:51.260 --> 00:24:54.230
How can we use you
to put this forth?

00:24:54.230 --> 00:24:55.850
But at the end of
the day, what we

00:24:55.850 --> 00:24:58.058
were able to do with the
Women's March on Washington,

00:24:58.058 --> 00:25:01.160
inspired by longtime work
by people like Dr. Kimberly

00:25:01.160 --> 00:25:04.730
is that it was an intersectional
march that was led by women.

00:25:04.730 --> 00:25:05.840
It wasn't a women's march.

00:25:05.840 --> 00:25:07.250
Because there were
men that were there,

00:25:07.250 --> 00:25:09.666
and it was also an opportunity
for us to center to climate

00:25:09.666 --> 00:25:11.630
justice, racial justice,
there were plenty

00:25:11.630 --> 00:25:12.530
of black women on the stage.

00:25:12.530 --> 00:25:14.090
And I didn't say this
earlier about myself.

00:25:14.090 --> 00:25:15.710
So I'm a Palestinian
Muslim American.

00:25:15.710 --> 00:25:16.584
I'm an Arab-American.

00:25:16.584 --> 00:25:20.210
I'm white if you want to
be technical, according

00:25:20.210 --> 00:25:21.735
to the US Census Bureau, right?

00:25:21.735 --> 00:25:22.610
So I have light skin.

00:25:22.610 --> 00:25:23.660
If I took this hijab off.

00:25:23.660 --> 00:25:25.576
I'd be like any other
white lady in this room.

00:25:25.576 --> 00:25:27.710
Darker hair, but I am white.

00:25:27.710 --> 00:25:30.290
I mean, race wise.

00:25:30.290 --> 00:25:33.560
So I chose as one of
the co-chairs to center

00:25:33.560 --> 00:25:35.300
black Muslim woman in the March.

00:25:35.300 --> 00:25:37.460
So for example, you
saw Alia Sharif,

00:25:37.460 --> 00:25:40.070
she's a hip hop
artist from Oakland.

00:25:40.070 --> 00:25:42.080
We had Muhammad Ali's daughter.

00:25:42.080 --> 00:25:44.300
We had Sister Iesha
Prime from Baltimore.

00:25:44.300 --> 00:25:47.120
Like I chose to use
my own privilege

00:25:47.120 --> 00:25:49.790
as a light-skinned Muslim,
who may not have privilege

00:25:49.790 --> 00:25:53.467
in the outside general society,
but within my own community,

00:25:53.467 --> 00:25:54.050
let's be real.

00:25:54.050 --> 00:25:56.060
I do get more platforms
than black Muslim women

00:25:56.060 --> 00:25:56.851
do in my community.

00:25:56.851 --> 00:25:59.310
So I chose at that moment
to be able to say, OK,

00:25:59.310 --> 00:26:01.100
who am I centering
for my community here?

00:26:01.100 --> 00:26:03.650
I'm going to center black
Muslim women voices.

00:26:03.650 --> 00:26:07.070
And at the Women's March being
able to center trans voices

00:26:07.070 --> 00:26:10.850
and center women of color
who are actually doing work

00:26:10.850 --> 00:26:13.852
that is not necessarily
connected to being per se

00:26:13.852 --> 00:26:14.560
a woman of color.

00:26:14.560 --> 00:26:18.380
So for example, the
president of NRDC,

00:26:18.380 --> 00:26:20.450
which is the National
Resource Defense Council,

00:26:20.450 --> 00:26:21.380
is a black woman.

00:26:21.380 --> 00:26:23.690
And she has dedicated her
life to climate justice,

00:26:23.690 --> 00:26:24.270
for example.

00:26:24.270 --> 00:26:26.360
Being able to also
take people and show

00:26:26.360 --> 00:26:28.610
people that I don't have
to be a Muslim woman that

00:26:28.610 --> 00:26:30.290
works on Muslim
issues, I could be

00:26:30.290 --> 00:26:32.180
a Muslim woman running
a reproductive rights

00:26:32.180 --> 00:26:32.730
organization.

00:26:32.730 --> 00:26:34.610
I could be a Muslim woman
running a climate justice

00:26:34.610 --> 00:26:35.200
organization.

00:26:35.200 --> 00:26:36.570
So we did that.

00:26:36.570 --> 00:26:38.510
And we were able to
center those voices,

00:26:38.510 --> 00:26:41.090
and we were also
able to show people--

00:26:41.090 --> 00:26:43.322
for example, like we
had no shame saying

00:26:43.322 --> 00:26:44.780
to someone like
Scarlett Johansson,

00:26:44.780 --> 00:26:47.155
you went over your time, and
you're getting your mic cut.

00:26:47.155 --> 00:26:52.270
Like you don't get more time
than the undocumented Pakistani

00:26:52.270 --> 00:26:53.270
girl from Staten Island.

00:26:53.270 --> 00:26:57.870
The idea that we were able
to say, yes, and by the way,

00:26:57.870 --> 00:26:59.330
FYI, you probably
don't know this.

00:26:59.330 --> 00:27:01.580
We didn't invite those
celebrities just so you know.

00:27:01.580 --> 00:27:03.170
Those were people
that came to us

00:27:03.170 --> 00:27:05.260
and wanted to get down
with what we were doing.

00:27:05.260 --> 00:27:07.010
So we didn't have to
go out and reach out.

00:27:07.010 --> 00:27:10.034
The people we recruited were the
actual activists, organizers,

00:27:10.034 --> 00:27:12.200
and directly impacted people
that were at the March.

00:27:12.200 --> 00:27:14.930
So my point is that the
Women's March on Washington

00:27:14.930 --> 00:27:16.130
wasn't all glory.

00:27:16.130 --> 00:27:17.270
There was tense moments.

00:27:17.270 --> 00:27:19.520
There were moments
where, believe it or not,

00:27:19.520 --> 00:27:22.160
we were in intense conversations
where I remember clearly

00:27:22.160 --> 00:27:26.690
where one woman said, a white
woman said, I'm feeling,

00:27:26.690 --> 00:27:27.500
quote--

00:27:27.500 --> 00:27:29.090
get ready for this one--

00:27:29.090 --> 00:27:30.950
"I'm feeling like a
second class citizen."

00:27:34.160 --> 00:27:37.280
Excuse me, do you
even understand

00:27:37.280 --> 00:27:40.850
for you to be able to
say what it means to be--

00:27:40.850 --> 00:27:43.430
I'm being marginalized
in this space.

00:27:43.430 --> 00:27:44.919
Excuse me.

00:27:44.919 --> 00:27:47.210
So being able to also allow
people to think and reflect

00:27:47.210 --> 00:27:48.585
on the type of
language that they

00:27:48.585 --> 00:27:50.600
use with people that
actually do fundamentally

00:27:50.600 --> 00:27:52.160
understand marginalization.

00:27:52.160 --> 00:27:54.234
People who
fundamentally understand

00:27:54.234 --> 00:27:56.150
what it means to be a
second class citizen not

00:27:56.150 --> 00:27:59.060
to say that women historically
haven't, white women included,

00:27:59.060 --> 00:28:01.520
haven't felt like in certain
spaces as second class

00:28:01.520 --> 00:28:03.980
citizens, but to be in a
space with women of color who

00:28:03.980 --> 00:28:05.510
have had loved ones--

00:28:05.510 --> 00:28:10.690
in our group-- loved ones die to
gun violence, police violence,

00:28:10.690 --> 00:28:12.320
Carmen Perez's
sister, like people

00:28:12.320 --> 00:28:14.690
who have been around gang
activity that has directly

00:28:14.690 --> 00:28:16.065
impacted their
family, people who

00:28:16.065 --> 00:28:18.260
understand state violence,
like in a very deep way,

00:28:18.260 --> 00:28:22.070
have not gotten jobs because
of their race or other reasons,

00:28:22.070 --> 00:28:24.360
for them to hear that,
it was triggering.

00:28:24.360 --> 00:28:25.410
People were triggered.

00:28:25.410 --> 00:28:28.020
And so there was a
lot of hard moments.

00:28:28.020 --> 00:28:30.502
But what we ended up
manifesting at the Women's

00:28:30.502 --> 00:28:32.960
March on Washington, and this
wasn't successful everywhere.

00:28:32.960 --> 00:28:35.990
There were some states where
some of the people of color

00:28:35.990 --> 00:28:38.210
were like, nah.

00:28:38.210 --> 00:28:39.200
We ain't.

00:28:39.200 --> 00:28:40.760
And we weren't
responsible for that,

00:28:40.760 --> 00:28:43.425
because it was a decentralized
method of organizing, where

00:28:43.425 --> 00:28:45.050
there were people
who individually took

00:28:45.050 --> 00:28:46.550
the branding of the
Women's March on Washington

00:28:46.550 --> 00:28:47.480
and made it their own.

00:28:47.480 --> 00:28:48.646
We saw that as a first step.

00:28:48.646 --> 00:28:51.740
But we did this in an
intersectional way.

00:28:51.740 --> 00:28:55.631
We made sure that the agenda not
only gave women of color seats

00:28:55.631 --> 00:28:58.130
at the table, but that the women
of color were on the table.

00:28:58.130 --> 00:28:59.970
Like if you weren't
talking about us,

00:28:59.970 --> 00:29:01.970
and we weren't at the
center of the conversation

00:29:01.970 --> 00:29:04.794
as the most directly impacted
in this current environment,

00:29:04.794 --> 00:29:06.460
we didn't want anything
to do with that.

00:29:06.460 --> 00:29:10.700
But also being able to
see the power of centering

00:29:10.700 --> 00:29:13.410
women of color, not just their
issues, but them as leaders.

00:29:13.410 --> 00:29:16.220
So we came to the Women's March
on Washington, I was like look.

00:29:16.220 --> 00:29:18.370
You ain't putting my cute
face as a token Muslim,

00:29:18.370 --> 00:29:20.390
like that's just not happening.

00:29:20.390 --> 00:29:21.770
I want to be a boss here.

00:29:21.770 --> 00:29:23.450
And I want to have
a leadership role.

00:29:23.450 --> 00:29:24.140
What do you want to do?

00:29:24.140 --> 00:29:26.265
I want to fundraise, I
think that I'm good at that.

00:29:26.265 --> 00:29:28.070
They were like, you
want to fundraise?

00:29:28.070 --> 00:29:29.150
Yes, I want to fundraise.

00:29:29.150 --> 00:29:31.670
And the reason why I
wanted to fundraise also

00:29:31.670 --> 00:29:33.620
is because I wanted
to teach people

00:29:33.620 --> 00:29:36.920
about being able to organize
a movement that is powered

00:29:36.920 --> 00:29:39.397
by the people, which is
not a concept people often

00:29:39.397 --> 00:29:39.980
to understand.

00:29:39.980 --> 00:29:42.860
They always think we need to
have Wal-Mart in the back,

00:29:42.860 --> 00:29:45.830
or even, to be honest,
even Google, right?

00:29:45.830 --> 00:29:47.629
Even if you're a
corp like Patagonia,

00:29:47.629 --> 00:29:49.670
there are some companies
that you may see and say

00:29:49.670 --> 00:29:51.530
they're corporate responsible.

00:29:51.530 --> 00:29:54.682
They're whatever, you
know what I'm saying.

00:29:54.682 --> 00:29:55.640
And I said, guess what?

00:29:55.640 --> 00:29:57.090
We could do this
without corporations.

00:29:57.090 --> 00:29:59.510
I will not stand on a stage
that has Coca-Cola, or Pepsi

00:29:59.510 --> 00:30:01.760
or any corporation behind me.

00:30:01.760 --> 00:30:03.981
And white folks in
particular were really

00:30:03.981 --> 00:30:06.230
like I don't think you're
going to be able to do that.

00:30:06.230 --> 00:30:07.340
And we did it.

00:30:07.340 --> 00:30:09.860
The March on Washington
was funded by the people--

00:30:09.860 --> 00:30:12.980
by the $27, the $50,
the $20, the $10.

00:30:12.980 --> 00:30:16.760
And it was also by the partners,
Planned Parenthood, MoveOn.org,

00:30:16.760 --> 00:30:19.021
ACLU, and those type of folks
that came in and gave us

00:30:19.021 --> 00:30:19.520
that money.

00:30:19.520 --> 00:30:22.784
So being able to have
these hard conversations,

00:30:22.784 --> 00:30:24.950
being able to be women of
color and say we will only

00:30:24.950 --> 00:30:27.251
work under these
circumstances and being heard,

00:30:27.251 --> 00:30:29.750
and that's why I want to give
the white women that we worked

00:30:29.750 --> 00:30:32.930
with credit, because they
could have been like nah,

00:30:32.930 --> 00:30:35.240
this is our, we
started this, that's

00:30:35.240 --> 00:30:36.680
not how we envisioned it.

00:30:36.680 --> 00:30:37.850
So you all need to step out.

00:30:37.850 --> 00:30:41.120
We'll go find some other women
of color who aren't going to be

00:30:41.120 --> 00:30:43.160
like y'all, and make us
do whatever we wanted.

00:30:43.160 --> 00:30:44.300
And they were like no.

00:30:44.300 --> 00:30:45.650
Maybe we're going to
learn something from you,

00:30:45.650 --> 00:30:47.630
and maybe we are going
to do intersexual

00:30:47.630 --> 00:30:49.546
and that's what happened
at the Women's March.

00:30:49.546 --> 00:30:51.470
So I want all that to
say that I give credit

00:30:51.470 --> 00:30:53.210
to those white
women who listened.

00:30:53.210 --> 00:30:54.770
We actually said this to them.

00:30:54.770 --> 00:30:56.840
Can you just listen
for a second?

00:30:56.840 --> 00:30:59.590
So Tamika Mallory, who many
of you may know, is quite,

00:30:59.590 --> 00:31:01.875
she got a little spice
in her, you know?

00:31:01.875 --> 00:31:02.750
She's from the Bronx.

00:31:02.750 --> 00:31:05.631
Like she's no joke, like
she puts it out there,

00:31:05.631 --> 00:31:06.630
you take it or leave it.

00:31:06.630 --> 00:31:09.300
And one day, she said,
do you know my story?

00:31:09.300 --> 00:31:11.180
And when she shares that
her son's father was

00:31:11.180 --> 00:31:14.270
shot and killed when her
son was only two years old,

00:31:14.270 --> 00:31:17.120
found in a ditch two
weeks after he was dead,

00:31:17.120 --> 00:31:18.470
and she had to witness that.

00:31:18.470 --> 00:31:20.303
And her son's growing
up without his father,

00:31:20.303 --> 00:31:22.870
living in a poor
community in the Bronx

00:31:22.870 --> 00:31:25.730
and growing up in a civil
rights community and family

00:31:25.730 --> 00:31:27.590
and has seen people
in her family arrested

00:31:27.590 --> 00:31:30.260
and incarcerated, told
these very personal stories

00:31:30.260 --> 00:31:31.160
about her family.

00:31:31.160 --> 00:31:33.290
Then the women were like--
because you will never

00:31:33.290 --> 00:31:34.410
experience what
Tamika Mallory has.

00:31:34.410 --> 00:31:36.350
So don't ask her why
she's angry all the time.

00:31:36.350 --> 00:31:37.490
She got reason to be angry.

00:31:37.490 --> 00:31:39.800
And when Carmen tells
you that her sister was

00:31:39.800 --> 00:31:41.667
buried on her 17th birthday.

00:31:41.667 --> 00:31:43.250
So when it was
Carmen's 17th birthday,

00:31:43.250 --> 00:31:45.140
her sister, who was
only two years older

00:31:45.140 --> 00:31:47.330
was buried on her birthday
in Oxnard, California.

00:31:47.330 --> 00:31:51.110
She grew up in a community
that was [INAUDIBLE] with gang

00:31:51.110 --> 00:31:52.832
violence and poverty.

00:31:52.832 --> 00:31:54.290
And when you hear
their stories, it

00:31:54.290 --> 00:31:56.345
makes you sit back
and say whoa ho.

00:31:56.345 --> 00:31:59.270
I'm never going to experience
what these ladies saw.

00:31:59.270 --> 00:31:59.900
You know what?

00:31:59.900 --> 00:32:01.070
I've got something
to learn from them.

00:32:01.070 --> 00:32:03.111
So all that it required
was for women to sit back

00:32:03.111 --> 00:32:05.060
not be defensive and
learn and listen,

00:32:05.060 --> 00:32:08.840
and that's how we got to January
21st, which was up until today,

00:32:08.840 --> 00:32:10.730
and I hope folks want
to do bigger than that,

00:32:10.730 --> 00:32:12.600
it is the largest
protest in US history.

00:32:12.600 --> 00:32:16.157
And it happened this year in
your generation on our watch

00:32:16.157 --> 00:32:17.990
and I hope that we
continue to do that work.

00:32:17.990 --> 00:32:19.031
MYOSHA MCAFEE: Thank you.

00:32:19.031 --> 00:32:25.800
[APPLAUSE]

00:32:25.800 --> 00:32:28.699
So I'm going to go
to Dr. Kim next,

00:32:28.699 --> 00:32:30.240
asking the question
of her, how do we

00:32:30.240 --> 00:32:33.240
be intentional about
being intersectional?

00:32:33.240 --> 00:32:36.090
And I want to build on
what Linda just laid out.

00:32:36.090 --> 00:32:37.740
And if you missed
it, I just want

00:32:37.740 --> 00:32:39.156
to hit you with
the bullet points,

00:32:39.156 --> 00:32:41.820
you know, at Google, we like the
hit me with the bullet point.

00:32:41.820 --> 00:32:43.590
Women of color, I
think what she laid out

00:32:43.590 --> 00:32:45.709
is being willing to ask
tough questions to people

00:32:45.709 --> 00:32:48.000
in the dominant group, being
willing to educate but not

00:32:48.000 --> 00:32:49.230
like necessarily yourself.

00:32:49.230 --> 00:32:51.220
Here are some books if
you want to read it.

00:32:51.220 --> 00:32:55.240
So you don't sit yourself in
this racial battle fatigue.

00:32:55.240 --> 00:32:57.522
You are assertive at
the negotiation table.

00:32:57.522 --> 00:32:58.230
She's very clear.

00:32:58.230 --> 00:33:00.900
Look, you're not going
to use me as a token.

00:33:00.900 --> 00:33:02.700
You're not going to
put my face up there.

00:33:02.700 --> 00:33:04.200
We're not going to have
Coca-Cola in the background,

00:33:04.200 --> 00:33:06.930
like very assertive in setting
parameters and boundaries

00:33:06.930 --> 00:33:08.550
around how are we
going to do this,

00:33:08.550 --> 00:33:11.820
rather than being at the
effect of the experience there.

00:33:11.820 --> 00:33:13.500
Using the privilege
she does have--

00:33:13.500 --> 00:33:14.860
and I think that's really
important to acknowledge

00:33:14.860 --> 00:33:15.660
when you're a person of color.

00:33:15.660 --> 00:33:17.790
Like we're all walking
around with these identities

00:33:17.790 --> 00:33:19.248
of both privilege
and disadvantage.

00:33:19.248 --> 00:33:22.530
So she's naming, as a
lighter-skinned Muslim woman,

00:33:22.530 --> 00:33:25.500
like what privilege do I
have here that I can center

00:33:25.500 --> 00:33:27.060
somebody else's experience?

00:33:27.060 --> 00:33:28.920
So thinking about
that as a black woman,

00:33:28.920 --> 00:33:30.210
are there people
amongst that community

00:33:30.210 --> 00:33:30.920
that I need to be centering?

00:33:30.920 --> 00:33:32.586
Because I'm privileged
in a certain way.

00:33:32.586 --> 00:33:35.850
I am highly educated at an
elite Ivy League university.

00:33:35.850 --> 00:33:38.550
There's definitely room for me
to make space for other women,

00:33:38.550 --> 00:33:41.630
other lived experiences,
other frameworks.

00:33:41.630 --> 00:33:43.670
And then equalizing,
despite status.

00:33:43.670 --> 00:33:48.821
What was the famous
person, I forgot her name.

00:33:48.821 --> 00:33:49.570
Was it something--

00:33:49.570 --> 00:33:50.070
KIM CRENSHAW:
Scarlett Johansson.

00:33:50.070 --> 00:33:51.120
MYOSHA MCAFEE: Yes,
Scarlett Johansson.

00:33:51.120 --> 00:33:52.710
It's like you don't
get more talk time

00:33:52.710 --> 00:33:54.870
than an undocumented immigrant.

00:33:54.870 --> 00:33:57.370
So I mean even thinking about
equalizing on that level.

00:33:57.370 --> 00:33:59.940
And I think for white women in
particular, humility, I think,

00:33:59.940 --> 00:34:02.430
came up a lot, a
willingness to learn came up

00:34:02.430 --> 00:34:06.270
and a willingness to follow,
like regardless of your title,

00:34:06.270 --> 00:34:07.950
your position, you fall back.

00:34:07.950 --> 00:34:09.659
Somebody else in a
marginalized community

00:34:09.659 --> 00:34:11.162
has certain
experiences, which does

00:34:11.162 --> 00:34:12.870
create a certain amount
of knowledge that

00:34:12.870 --> 00:34:14.699
informs what we should do next.

00:34:14.699 --> 00:34:16.739
That's the high
level bullet point.

00:34:16.739 --> 00:34:19.679
Dr. Kim we're going to
add to that list of how

00:34:19.679 --> 00:34:21.305
do we be intentional.

00:34:21.305 --> 00:34:23.429
Add to the list-- how to
be intentional about being

00:34:23.429 --> 00:34:23.930
intersectional?

00:34:23.930 --> 00:34:25.930
Because there are a lot
of people who are trying

00:34:25.930 --> 00:34:27.530
to figure out what to do next.

00:34:27.530 --> 00:34:29.100
KIM CRENSHAW: Yeah.

00:34:29.100 --> 00:34:31.650
Those are all, I
think, absolutely

00:34:31.650 --> 00:34:34.050
essential steps to take.

00:34:34.050 --> 00:34:38.760
I think what I would add
to it is an understanding

00:34:38.760 --> 00:34:43.350
that the challenge is
to multiple communities,

00:34:43.350 --> 00:34:45.489
not just to white women.

00:34:45.489 --> 00:34:48.060
So the March was a context
in which the conversation

00:34:48.060 --> 00:34:51.750
was about deprivileging
and shifting

00:34:51.750 --> 00:34:53.904
the frame to broaden it.

00:34:53.904 --> 00:34:55.320
But it's also the
case that that's

00:34:55.320 --> 00:35:00.294
a conversation that needs to
be had within institutions.

00:35:00.294 --> 00:35:01.710
It's a conversation
that has to be

00:35:01.710 --> 00:35:04.740
had within racial
justice struggles.

00:35:04.740 --> 00:35:08.040
It's a conversation that has to
be had within LGBTQ struggles.

00:35:08.040 --> 00:35:11.460
So in each of these spaces,
the same kind of moves

00:35:11.460 --> 00:35:14.790
often have to be made
in order to make sure

00:35:14.790 --> 00:35:17.010
that the intersectional
ways that certain kinds

00:35:17.010 --> 00:35:21.450
of experiences play
out are actually

00:35:21.450 --> 00:35:23.280
at the center of the movement.

00:35:23.280 --> 00:35:28.350
This conversation
started with a video clip

00:35:28.350 --> 00:35:31.860
from our organization on a
campaign called Say Her Name.

00:35:31.860 --> 00:35:35.610
And Say Her Name actually
came out of a march.

00:35:35.610 --> 00:35:39.360
We were in a march
in New York City

00:35:39.360 --> 00:35:43.380
around the non-indictment of the
officer responsible for killing

00:35:43.380 --> 00:35:45.300
Eric Gardner.

00:35:45.300 --> 00:35:48.240
There were thousands and
thousands of people there

00:35:48.240 --> 00:35:51.570
who had been drawn
because of that injustice.

00:35:51.570 --> 00:35:54.270
And in the process
of marching, we

00:35:54.270 --> 00:35:57.190
were calling out men who had
been killed by the police.

00:35:57.190 --> 00:35:59.790
And there was a whole spate
of them as many of you

00:35:59.790 --> 00:36:04.950
know, Michael Brown,
Tamir Rice, Freddie Gray.

00:36:04.950 --> 00:36:07.070
We started naming
some of the women who

00:36:07.070 --> 00:36:10.170
had been killed
at the same time,

00:36:10.170 --> 00:36:15.990
Michelle Cusseaux was killed
within two weeks of Mike Brown,

00:36:15.990 --> 00:36:17.730
and no one knew her name.

00:36:17.730 --> 00:36:21.000
Ara Russer, Tunisia
Anderson was killed a week

00:36:21.000 --> 00:36:23.790
before Tamir Rice, by the
same police department.

00:36:23.790 --> 00:36:26.340
No one knew knew her name.

00:36:26.340 --> 00:36:31.380
So some part of Say Her Name
is to build on the frame that

00:36:31.380 --> 00:36:32.165
already exists.

00:36:32.165 --> 00:36:35.220
So we know that
state-sanctioned violence

00:36:35.220 --> 00:36:38.580
has been racialized throughout
the history of this country.

00:36:38.580 --> 00:36:39.610
We have images.

00:36:39.610 --> 00:36:40.290
We have frames.

00:36:40.290 --> 00:36:41.956
We have quick ways
of thinking about it.

00:36:41.956 --> 00:36:45.120
A lot of people think
in terms of lynching.

00:36:45.120 --> 00:36:48.180
They think in terms of
the ways that police

00:36:48.180 --> 00:36:49.500
have contributed to that.

00:36:49.500 --> 00:36:52.950
But they think of that in
a gender exclusive way.

00:36:52.950 --> 00:36:56.250
So our challenge was to take
that frame and broaden it.

00:36:56.250 --> 00:36:58.710
To say, everything
you think you know

00:36:58.710 --> 00:37:02.040
about state-sanctioned
violence, yes, that's true.

00:37:02.040 --> 00:37:04.230
And also this.

00:37:04.230 --> 00:37:05.910
And also this.

00:37:05.910 --> 00:37:09.270
So in the same ways
that police have often

00:37:09.270 --> 00:37:13.720
said that Mike Brown
was like a monster.

00:37:13.720 --> 00:37:17.490
He was framed as someone who
had to be put down with a gun

00:37:17.490 --> 00:37:19.230
because he couldn't be stopped.

00:37:19.230 --> 00:37:21.690
Actually, police say the
same thing about black women

00:37:21.690 --> 00:37:23.166
who are killed.

00:37:23.166 --> 00:37:24.540
And when it's said
about a woman,

00:37:24.540 --> 00:37:27.690
it's clear that it's a racial
thing that's happening.

00:37:27.690 --> 00:37:34.410
There's no way that a woman
could be overtaken and tasered

00:37:34.410 --> 00:37:41.580
to death by seven different men
as happened in one of the cases

00:37:41.580 --> 00:37:43.320
that we highlight,
tasered to death,

00:37:43.320 --> 00:37:47.520
because they said she posed
a risk to their lives.

00:37:47.520 --> 00:37:49.800
This is something that's real.

00:37:49.800 --> 00:37:52.140
It's something that happened.

00:37:52.140 --> 00:37:54.960
It is a real risk
that black women face.

00:37:54.960 --> 00:37:57.630
So we try to build
intersectional awareness

00:37:57.630 --> 00:38:00.820
based on the single issue
ideas that people have.

00:38:00.820 --> 00:38:03.900
If you think this is what
state-sanctioned violence looks

00:38:03.900 --> 00:38:06.600
like from a racial
justice point of view,

00:38:06.600 --> 00:38:09.390
this is what happens when
you add gender to it.

00:38:09.390 --> 00:38:12.240
And it's the same
on the other side.

00:38:12.240 --> 00:38:16.720
There is a significant movement
around gender-based violence.

00:38:16.720 --> 00:38:18.630
Rape and sexual
abuse is something

00:38:18.630 --> 00:38:24.210
that women have organized
around for at least 50 years.

00:38:24.210 --> 00:38:27.000
You don't get
women's organizations

00:38:27.000 --> 00:38:29.940
organizing around
rape and sexual abuse

00:38:29.940 --> 00:38:32.520
by police officers.

00:38:32.520 --> 00:38:36.750
But just last year a
police officer in Oklahoma

00:38:36.750 --> 00:38:41.460
was convicted for raping and
abusing eight black women.

00:38:41.460 --> 00:38:45.630
What made it possible for
him to rape and abuse eight

00:38:45.630 --> 00:38:46.920
black women?

00:38:46.920 --> 00:38:49.560
It's intersectional
vulnerability.

00:38:49.560 --> 00:38:51.690
They're black women,
historically black women

00:38:51.690 --> 00:38:53.400
have not been believed.

00:38:53.400 --> 00:38:55.020
They were poor women.

00:38:55.020 --> 00:38:57.990
Many of them were
system-involved women,

00:38:57.990 --> 00:38:59.970
meaning they had
a criminal record.

00:38:59.970 --> 00:39:02.820
These were all things that
made this officer believe

00:39:02.820 --> 00:39:05.640
that he could do what he
could do with impunity

00:39:05.640 --> 00:39:07.450
and nothing was going to happen.

00:39:07.450 --> 00:39:10.800
So that's the intersectional
vulnerability.

00:39:10.800 --> 00:39:15.870
The problem is neither the
gender-based violence movement,

00:39:15.870 --> 00:39:19.080
nor quite honestly, the
anti-racist movement

00:39:19.080 --> 00:39:22.470
against police violence
took that case up.

00:39:22.470 --> 00:39:23.730
Why is that?

00:39:23.730 --> 00:39:25.410
It fell between the cracks.

00:39:25.410 --> 00:39:28.410
It fell between, the
way that you think

00:39:28.410 --> 00:39:30.170
about race-based violence.

00:39:30.170 --> 00:39:32.760
It's shooting, it's
beating, it's not raping.

00:39:32.760 --> 00:39:34.980
And it fell between
the way people think

00:39:34.980 --> 00:39:37.210
about violence against women.

00:39:37.210 --> 00:39:40.080
That's usually seen as
private, not as something

00:39:40.080 --> 00:39:42.760
that the state is
responsible for.

00:39:42.760 --> 00:39:45.570
So the basic message
is if we want

00:39:45.570 --> 00:39:48.790
to think how to
deepen our practice,

00:39:48.790 --> 00:39:51.180
we have to ask
concrete questions.

00:39:51.180 --> 00:39:53.730
This is the way
gender is imagined

00:39:53.730 --> 00:39:59.250
to be a factor in a workplace.

00:39:59.250 --> 00:40:00.510
Is it the only way?

00:40:00.510 --> 00:40:02.880
Are there other ways that
we can think about it?

00:40:02.880 --> 00:40:07.110
Or to flip the script, ,
yes, I'm subject to gender.

00:40:07.110 --> 00:40:09.780
But what advantages
do I have that I'm

00:40:09.780 --> 00:40:12.600
allowed to use in
order to navigate

00:40:12.600 --> 00:40:16.680
this space that another
woman who is not white has?

00:40:16.680 --> 00:40:18.270
I'd like to sometimes
think about it

00:40:18.270 --> 00:40:22.260
as the difference
between can the boss

00:40:22.260 --> 00:40:26.100
imagine you in his
living room or can he

00:40:26.100 --> 00:40:28.120
imagine you in the locker room?

00:40:28.120 --> 00:40:31.440
So if you're a man
of color, you do

00:40:31.440 --> 00:40:33.180
have that racial disadvantage.

00:40:33.180 --> 00:40:36.420
But you do have
shared masculinity,

00:40:36.420 --> 00:40:40.800
and sometimes you can navigate
your disadvantage with that.

00:40:40.800 --> 00:40:44.580
Or if you're a white woman,
yes, gender might be a factor.

00:40:44.580 --> 00:40:47.100
But you do have
social similarity.

00:40:47.100 --> 00:40:50.490
You do have a common
social cultural history

00:40:50.490 --> 00:40:52.140
that you might be able to use.

00:40:52.140 --> 00:40:55.500
But that woman of color has
neither of those things.

00:40:55.500 --> 00:40:58.470
And if you really want
to have some proof of it,

00:40:58.470 --> 00:41:01.050
look at some of the
studies on mentoring.

00:41:01.050 --> 00:41:03.280
Mentorship, everyone
knows, is one

00:41:03.280 --> 00:41:05.550
of the most significant
things that you can have

00:41:05.550 --> 00:41:07.890
to help you navigate upward.

00:41:07.890 --> 00:41:11.880
Mentors are most likely to share
some kind of social identity

00:41:11.880 --> 00:41:13.350
with their mentees.

00:41:13.350 --> 00:41:16.840
So if you can share being a
man or share being a woman,

00:41:16.840 --> 00:41:18.390
you're more likely
to be mentored

00:41:18.390 --> 00:41:21.280
than if you can't share
either one of those things.

00:41:21.280 --> 00:41:24.480
So a practice that says, look,
we know mentorship is good.

00:41:24.480 --> 00:41:26.940
But we know it also
doesn't equally

00:41:26.940 --> 00:41:30.000
extend across our
entire workforce, that's

00:41:30.000 --> 00:41:32.430
a moment for intersectional
intervention.

00:41:32.430 --> 00:41:35.280
Those are the kinds of moments
that you can make a difference

00:41:35.280 --> 00:41:38.460
by being aware of the
different situation of some

00:41:38.460 --> 00:41:39.439
of your workforce.

00:41:39.439 --> 00:41:40.480
MYOSHA MCAFEE: Thank you.

00:41:40.480 --> 00:41:42.855
So now we're going to make a
hard left just a little bit.

00:41:42.855 --> 00:41:46.080
And because we're in Texas, and
there were some policy changes

00:41:46.080 --> 00:41:48.120
that took place,
was it yesterday,

00:41:48.120 --> 00:41:50.250
around the transgender
bathroom policy,

00:41:50.250 --> 00:41:51.889
I wanted us to gently
talk about that.

00:41:51.889 --> 00:41:54.180
And EJ, I'll start with you,
but anybody else who wants

00:41:54.180 --> 00:41:55.860
to hop in on it.

00:41:55.860 --> 00:41:58.320
So last May the Department
of Education and Justice

00:41:58.320 --> 00:42:00.180
issued joint guidance
directing schools

00:42:00.180 --> 00:42:03.150
to let transgender students
use facilities that correspond

00:42:03.150 --> 00:42:06.900
with their gender identity based
on the Obama administration's

00:42:06.900 --> 00:42:09.540
interpretation of Title
IX, the federal law that

00:42:09.540 --> 00:42:12.240
prohibits sex
discrimination in schools

00:42:12.240 --> 00:42:13.710
to include gender identity.

00:42:13.710 --> 00:42:17.040
Trump's administration rescinded
this guidance yesterday

00:42:17.040 --> 00:42:19.170
without offering a replacement.

00:42:19.170 --> 00:42:23.160
Supporters of this say that
it's not anti-LGBTQ sentiment,

00:42:23.160 --> 00:42:25.357
but federal overreach
into state matters,

00:42:25.357 --> 00:42:27.190
and that schools should
be able to determine

00:42:27.190 --> 00:42:29.290
this policy at the local level.

00:42:29.290 --> 00:42:31.690
I'm curious about what would
be your recommendations, not

00:42:31.690 --> 00:42:33.730
just to schools, but
any organization.

00:42:33.730 --> 00:42:35.500
Because I think including
our organization

00:42:35.500 --> 00:42:37.585
is grappling with
this type of policy.

00:42:40.330 --> 00:42:43.120
EJ JOHNSON: Well,
I actually was just

00:42:43.120 --> 00:42:46.420
reminded of a story when
I was in high school.

00:42:46.420 --> 00:42:52.990
And I remember that we
had our LGBT club fought

00:42:52.990 --> 00:42:57.940
for having more gender
neutral bathrooms in school.

00:42:57.940 --> 00:43:00.164
And I even remember
talking to my friends

00:43:00.164 --> 00:43:01.580
and we were like,
well, who cares?

00:43:01.580 --> 00:43:03.850
I mean, like you have your
mens, you have your womens,

00:43:03.850 --> 00:43:06.080
and you go to the bathroom.

00:43:06.080 --> 00:43:11.440
And now here I am,
being me and doing me,

00:43:11.440 --> 00:43:19.030
and realize, OK, like so today
if my outfit requires a skirt,

00:43:19.030 --> 00:43:20.740
where do I go?

00:43:20.740 --> 00:43:22.185
You know, where
am I comfortable?

00:43:22.185 --> 00:43:24.310
I don't have a problem
peeing in the men's bathroom

00:43:24.310 --> 00:43:29.590
in whatever outfit I'm in, but
some people do, a lot of people

00:43:29.590 --> 00:43:30.430
do.

00:43:30.430 --> 00:43:36.460
So I just don't
understand why we wouldn't

00:43:36.460 --> 00:43:39.040
have more of those
bathrooms where people

00:43:39.040 --> 00:43:41.130
can be comfortable
or at least have

00:43:41.130 --> 00:43:42.880
those conversations
or an open environment

00:43:42.880 --> 00:43:45.190
where we can at
least talk about it.

00:43:45.190 --> 00:43:48.920
And I think that whether
in schools or in offices,

00:43:48.920 --> 00:43:50.620
I mean, those are
the types of places

00:43:50.620 --> 00:43:53.590
that we need to be having these
conversations about what's

00:43:53.590 --> 00:43:56.300
making our community
comfortable,

00:43:56.300 --> 00:43:58.300
especially when it's time
to go to the bathroom.

00:43:58.300 --> 00:44:01.090
Because everybody has
to go to the bathroom.

00:44:01.090 --> 00:44:08.030
And so in a school, why do you
want to put some gender fluid

00:44:08.030 --> 00:44:11.120
child or someone who doesn't
quite know what they're doing--

00:44:11.120 --> 00:44:13.550
but they're doing them, they
don't know where they fit

00:44:13.550 --> 00:44:14.300
in yet--

00:44:14.300 --> 00:44:16.820
in a situation
where they could get

00:44:16.820 --> 00:44:18.920
beat up or ultimately killed?

00:44:18.920 --> 00:44:20.960
You never know
what's going down.

00:44:20.960 --> 00:44:22.610
Especially in rough
neighborhoods,

00:44:22.610 --> 00:44:26.840
when people are
less educated, they

00:44:26.840 --> 00:44:28.770
don't know what's going on.

00:44:28.770 --> 00:44:30.530
They're very quick to judge.

00:44:30.530 --> 00:44:33.950
And they're very quick
to act on those impulses,

00:44:33.950 --> 00:44:36.770
just because they see
someone being different.

00:44:36.770 --> 00:44:39.860
And I always continue
to think that I'm just

00:44:39.860 --> 00:44:41.990
like why would you want
to subject somebody

00:44:41.990 --> 00:44:44.285
to that type of
unnecessary violence?

00:44:47.420 --> 00:44:51.050
And I'm also grateful that
we're at least having these

00:44:51.050 --> 00:44:54.320
conversations, because four
years ago we really weren't.

00:44:54.320 --> 00:44:57.200
I was just talking
to you earlier

00:44:57.200 --> 00:45:01.400
about the trans community
is having a revolution right

00:45:01.400 --> 00:45:03.045
now, which is great.

00:45:03.045 --> 00:45:05.420
We weren't really talking
about it before Caitlyn Jenner.

00:45:05.420 --> 00:45:07.850
But it's a blessing,
and it's a curse.

00:45:07.850 --> 00:45:12.200
Because it opens the door
to have a conversation.

00:45:12.200 --> 00:45:14.450
But it also lets in a different
type of discrimination

00:45:14.450 --> 00:45:16.370
and a different
type of ignorance.

00:45:16.370 --> 00:45:19.340
So I think that we
were making steps

00:45:19.340 --> 00:45:21.290
in the right direction
when it comes

00:45:21.290 --> 00:45:22.790
to having those bathrooms.

00:45:22.790 --> 00:45:26.176
And now that we're taking them
away, and now we have to think,

00:45:26.176 --> 00:45:27.800
the states and the
cities have to think

00:45:27.800 --> 00:45:29.910
about is this important or not?

00:45:29.910 --> 00:45:32.780
I'm like why are we taking
that step back, when we just

00:45:32.780 --> 00:45:35.990
made a great stride forward?

00:45:35.990 --> 00:45:37.490
LINDA SARSOUR: I
think to your point

00:45:37.490 --> 00:45:40.940
about how do you resist any
type of policy, including

00:45:40.940 --> 00:45:41.840
bathroom policies?

00:45:41.840 --> 00:45:44.131
And this is really the moment
that you think about what

00:45:44.131 --> 00:45:45.470
resistance actually looks like.

00:45:45.470 --> 00:45:47.594
And when you start taking
matters in your own hand.

00:45:47.594 --> 00:45:49.160
This is our country.

00:45:49.160 --> 00:45:50.270
These are our schools.

00:45:50.270 --> 00:45:52.910
Our taxpayer dollars pay for--

00:45:52.910 --> 00:45:54.320
our college campus.

00:45:54.320 --> 00:45:59.180
When I think about policies like
sanctuary campuses or sanctuary

00:45:59.180 --> 00:46:02.529
workplaces, anything
that this administration

00:46:02.529 --> 00:46:04.070
is trying to implement
moving forward

00:46:04.070 --> 00:46:07.730
is that, the question is
what are you willing to do?

00:46:07.730 --> 00:46:11.240
Is the principle going to find
that resistance in her or him?

00:46:11.240 --> 00:46:15.350
Is the corporate CEO going
to say, not on my watch,

00:46:15.350 --> 00:46:20.810
not in my company,
whatever that issue is

00:46:20.810 --> 00:46:21.980
that's going to be impacted.

00:46:21.980 --> 00:46:24.830
And I always tell people,
people will say, you know what?

00:46:24.830 --> 00:46:26.847
Now it's the law, whatever.

00:46:26.847 --> 00:46:28.180
You know this is just how it is.

00:46:28.180 --> 00:46:30.376
And I always tell people
like, that offends me

00:46:30.376 --> 00:46:31.250
when people say that.

00:46:31.250 --> 00:46:32.840
Because I'm like, oh,
so what you're saying

00:46:32.840 --> 00:46:34.550
is if you lived at
the time of slavery,

00:46:34.550 --> 00:46:36.950
you would be cool with slavery,
because slavery was law.

00:46:36.950 --> 00:46:38.750
If you lived at the
time of segregation,

00:46:38.750 --> 00:46:41.420
you were cool with segregation
of races, because you know,

00:46:41.420 --> 00:46:42.350
it was the law.

00:46:42.350 --> 00:46:44.450
So this idea that in this
country we talk a lot,

00:46:44.450 --> 00:46:46.400
and this particular
administration, which

00:46:46.400 --> 00:46:49.320
is already showing early
signs of fascism, which

00:46:49.320 --> 00:46:51.620
is this obsession
with law and order,

00:46:51.620 --> 00:46:54.470
with obsession with
like national security,

00:46:54.470 --> 00:46:56.570
you know disdain
for intellectuals

00:46:56.570 --> 00:46:59.960
and the arts, like
rampant sexism,

00:46:59.960 --> 00:47:03.440
like all the things that we're
seeing from this administration

00:47:03.440 --> 00:47:04.569
are clearly fascism.

00:47:04.569 --> 00:47:06.860
If you ever went to the
Holocaust Museum in Washington,

00:47:06.860 --> 00:47:08.910
DC, there's a sign--
that I didn't write--

00:47:08.910 --> 00:47:10.745
that says early warning
signs of fascism.

00:47:10.745 --> 00:47:13.370
And literally all these things
I just listed are word for word,

00:47:13.370 --> 00:47:15.410
I like memorized them.

00:47:15.410 --> 00:47:18.300
So I think that in this
moment that we are in,

00:47:18.300 --> 00:47:20.696
and we haven't really been in
it at least in my lifetime,

00:47:20.696 --> 00:47:22.070
I mean I know
obviously there has

00:47:22.070 --> 00:47:24.290
been many moments of
resistance in the past.

00:47:24.290 --> 00:47:27.530
But in my lifetime, I'm 36 years
old, I haven't see a moment,

00:47:27.530 --> 00:47:30.920
and I haven't yet even seen it
in the way I want to see it.

00:47:30.920 --> 00:47:32.420
This is the time
to be like, I don't

00:47:32.420 --> 00:47:34.940
give a damn what policies
come from the top.

00:47:34.940 --> 00:47:37.977
I'm ready to protect the people
that are in my communities.

00:47:37.977 --> 00:47:39.560
I'm ready to protect
the students that

00:47:39.560 --> 00:47:40.490
come to my schools.

00:47:40.490 --> 00:47:43.070
I'm going to protect you know
those who come to my church

00:47:43.070 --> 00:47:44.690
or my synagogue or my mosque.

00:47:44.690 --> 00:47:48.290
You know that this idea that
we have given up so much power

00:47:48.290 --> 00:47:50.782
to the law and to the government
that we don't understand

00:47:50.782 --> 00:47:51.740
the power that we have.

00:47:51.740 --> 00:47:53.900
And that we have to
be willing to say, OK,

00:47:53.900 --> 00:47:56.527
you want to come to my church
and take undocumented people,

00:47:56.527 --> 00:47:57.860
you got to get through me first.

00:47:57.860 --> 00:47:59.030
You want to come to--

00:48:02.180 --> 00:48:05.510
we were talking about this,
even with the potential stop

00:48:05.510 --> 00:48:08.510
and frisk national law, like
we literally have a Blue Lives

00:48:08.510 --> 00:48:09.980
Matter administration.

00:48:09.980 --> 00:48:13.040
And notice this,
notice that it's

00:48:13.040 --> 00:48:15.740
been a few weeks where
we haven't really

00:48:15.740 --> 00:48:19.160
had the trending hashtags about
the black woman or black man

00:48:19.160 --> 00:48:21.530
that has been killed
by the police, right?

00:48:21.530 --> 00:48:23.525
Does that mean
it's not happening?

00:48:23.525 --> 00:48:25.250
It's that we're
so damn distracted

00:48:25.250 --> 00:48:29.120
by the outrageousness
that is coming out

00:48:29.120 --> 00:48:31.960
of this administration, stuff
that I think we could resist

00:48:31.960 --> 00:48:34.610
against, that we forgot
the issues we were already

00:48:34.610 --> 00:48:35.762
working on.

00:48:35.762 --> 00:48:37.970
MYOSHA MCAFEE: Yes, so where
I want to go with this--

00:48:37.970 --> 00:48:39.886
is we have a few minutes
left before the Q&amp;A--

00:48:39.886 --> 00:48:42.230
is what you just
said there is getting

00:48:42.230 --> 00:48:44.420
to a position of realizing
the power that I actually

00:48:44.420 --> 00:48:47.380
have, shifting my frame in
terms of my relationship to it,

00:48:47.380 --> 00:48:48.419
and [INAUDIBLE] courage.

00:48:48.419 --> 00:48:50.210
What I kind of felt
kind of ease up my back

00:48:50.210 --> 00:48:53.320
when you were talking through
that is people being like,

00:48:53.320 --> 00:48:56.154
I don't really know if I
have that much courage.

00:48:56.154 --> 00:48:58.070
I don't even know if I
can walk in that place.

00:48:58.070 --> 00:49:02.000
So I'm wondering, like final
words from everybody up here.

00:49:02.000 --> 00:49:03.989
I'm keeping it like
20 seconds or less.

00:49:03.989 --> 00:49:05.030
Just thinking about how--

00:49:05.030 --> 00:49:05.840
TANZINA VEGA: I have
more than 20 seconds.

00:49:05.840 --> 00:49:06.680
MYOSHA MCAFEE: --how does one--

00:49:06.680 --> 00:49:07.510
you have more--

00:49:07.510 --> 00:49:08.610
TANZINA VEGA: Because
I was taking notes.

00:49:08.610 --> 00:49:08.940
MYOSHA MCAFEE: How
do we get there?

00:49:08.940 --> 00:49:10.231
TANZINA VEGA: I'm a journalist.

00:49:10.231 --> 00:49:11.090
OK.

00:49:11.090 --> 00:49:11.689
I'm sorry.

00:49:11.689 --> 00:49:12.480
I was taking notes.

00:49:12.480 --> 00:49:16.200
I wasn't texting, I swear.

00:49:16.200 --> 00:49:19.210
OK, so a couple of things,
how do we get there?

00:49:19.210 --> 00:49:23.090
One of the things that
I think is critical.

00:49:23.090 --> 00:49:25.240
We touched on this a
little bit here and there,

00:49:25.240 --> 00:49:27.130
but I want to drive this home.

00:49:29.800 --> 00:49:32.470
You have to take
personal responsibility

00:49:32.470 --> 00:49:35.800
for understanding the
way this country works,

00:49:35.800 --> 00:49:37.900
the way this
country was founded,

00:49:37.900 --> 00:49:42.010
the way systems work
and institutions work.

00:49:42.010 --> 00:49:45.190
It's my job, right,
literally my job

00:49:45.190 --> 00:49:48.767
to explain the systems
of inequity, racism,

00:49:48.767 --> 00:49:50.350
and how it gets
played out in America.

00:49:50.350 --> 00:49:52.930
That is literally
what I am paid to do.

00:49:52.930 --> 00:49:54.550
And I love it and
I will continue

00:49:54.550 --> 00:49:56.890
to do it as long as I can.

00:49:56.890 --> 00:49:58.450
I recently got an
email from someone.

00:49:58.450 --> 00:50:02.169
I wrote a story the
headline was "What

00:50:02.169 --> 00:50:03.460
About the Black Working Class?"

00:50:03.460 --> 00:50:05.680
Because the narrative we
heard during the campaign

00:50:05.680 --> 00:50:08.200
was white working class, white
working class, white working

00:50:08.200 --> 00:50:09.710
class, white working
class, right?

00:50:09.710 --> 00:50:10.620
Am I wrong?

00:50:10.620 --> 00:50:13.610
OK, we left out a whole
segment of the population.

00:50:13.610 --> 00:50:15.160
And this is critical.

00:50:15.160 --> 00:50:19.690
We are in a moment right now
of absolute necessary media

00:50:19.690 --> 00:50:20.240
literacy.

00:50:20.240 --> 00:50:23.020
You must understand the
narratives that are being told.

00:50:23.020 --> 00:50:25.060
You have to take responsibility.

00:50:25.060 --> 00:50:27.280
And learn about as
much as you can.

00:50:27.280 --> 00:50:29.590
And then begin to
ask the questions.

00:50:29.590 --> 00:50:32.350
So my story about the black
working class comes out.

00:50:32.350 --> 00:50:36.190
And I get an email from a reader
who says, look, I'm white.

00:50:36.190 --> 00:50:37.720
I'm married.

00:50:37.720 --> 00:50:38.620
Live in the Midwest.

00:50:38.620 --> 00:50:41.440
My wife and I, we're
screwed by the recession.

00:50:41.440 --> 00:50:44.380
How do you explain what you're
trying to say in this piece

00:50:44.380 --> 00:50:45.520
and how that affects me?

00:50:45.520 --> 00:50:46.750
And I said great.

00:50:46.750 --> 00:50:47.670
You want data.

00:50:47.670 --> 00:50:49.360
Data you shall have.

00:50:49.360 --> 00:50:51.610
And I took 20, 30
minutes out of my day

00:50:51.610 --> 00:50:54.130
and crafted an email to
him, very long email,

00:50:54.130 --> 00:50:57.490
explaining point by point that
this wasn't about the fact

00:50:57.490 --> 00:51:00.160
that whites weren't
affected by the housing

00:51:00.160 --> 00:51:02.320
crisis or the great recession.

00:51:02.320 --> 00:51:04.510
The fact of the matter
is, if you understand

00:51:04.510 --> 00:51:06.370
wealth inequity
in America, there

00:51:06.370 --> 00:51:08.560
is a racial wealth
gap where whites

00:51:08.560 --> 00:51:14.140
continue to have 13 times the
wealth of blacks and Latinos.

00:51:14.140 --> 00:51:16.780
I'm going to put that in
actual figures for you.

00:51:16.780 --> 00:51:21.490
$140,000 is the average
wealth for a white family,

00:51:21.490 --> 00:51:26.560
$11,000 for black families,
and $13,000 for Latinos.

00:51:26.560 --> 00:51:27.880
The math has been done.

00:51:27.880 --> 00:51:29.980
These are not typos.

00:51:29.980 --> 00:51:32.860
You need to understand
and take responsibility

00:51:32.860 --> 00:51:36.250
for learning about how we
got here and why we got here.

00:51:36.250 --> 00:51:38.830
That's my job and I'm happy
to answer those questions.

00:51:38.830 --> 00:51:40.500
But we're at a point
right now where

00:51:40.500 --> 00:51:43.540
we can no longer say I have
no idea what's happening.

00:51:43.540 --> 00:51:44.920
I really don't know.

00:51:44.920 --> 00:51:47.032
Because you know what,
it's not acceptable.

00:51:47.032 --> 00:51:48.490
The other thing I
will say that you

00:51:48.490 --> 00:51:50.940
can't put the burden on
marginalized communities

00:51:50.940 --> 00:51:53.410
to always explain and
do the work for you.

00:51:53.410 --> 00:51:56.650
And there was a book called
"This Bridge Called My Back,"

00:51:56.650 --> 00:51:59.080
that analogy right there.

00:51:59.080 --> 00:52:00.470
Think about that for a minute.

00:52:00.470 --> 00:52:02.179
That's really I think the point.

00:52:02.179 --> 00:52:03.220
MYOSHA MCAFEE: Thank you.

00:52:03.220 --> 00:52:05.303
EJ JOHNSON: I agree with
everything you just said.

00:52:05.303 --> 00:52:06.280
That was everything.

00:52:06.280 --> 00:52:10.630
But just a little more
I guess on the burden

00:52:10.630 --> 00:52:13.270
not being on our
back, but I think

00:52:13.270 --> 00:52:15.640
that that's a great point.

00:52:15.640 --> 00:52:19.424
At the same time, I
think just with outrage

00:52:19.424 --> 00:52:21.340
I think when it comes
to gender and sexuality,

00:52:21.340 --> 00:52:23.380
just because it's
such a gray area.

00:52:23.380 --> 00:52:26.200
Sometimes we do have to
explain a little more.

00:52:26.200 --> 00:52:28.704
And I for instance
do get a bit annoyed.

00:52:28.704 --> 00:52:30.370
Well, why doesn't
this person figure out

00:52:30.370 --> 00:52:31.690
what's going on in my life?

00:52:31.690 --> 00:52:34.060
That I set my rules.

00:52:34.060 --> 00:52:35.290
I set my standards.

00:52:35.290 --> 00:52:36.910
I know what to call myself.

00:52:36.910 --> 00:52:37.960
You don't.

00:52:37.960 --> 00:52:42.280
But instead of assuming what
you think I'd like to be called,

00:52:42.280 --> 00:52:43.450
you can just ask.

00:52:43.450 --> 00:52:45.010
And I'll let you know.

00:52:45.010 --> 00:52:47.969
So I think in that
conversation, you

00:52:47.969 --> 00:52:50.010
might have to explain
yourself a little bit more.

00:52:50.010 --> 00:52:51.940
And that's OK.

00:52:51.940 --> 00:52:53.110
Don't get annoyed.

00:52:53.110 --> 00:52:55.647
You know it's not them
being annoying or ignorant.

00:52:55.647 --> 00:52:57.730
They're just trying to
figure out what's going on.

00:52:57.730 --> 00:52:59.950
And we have to take
that part to just

00:52:59.950 --> 00:53:01.842
explain a little more
until we get to a place

00:53:01.842 --> 00:53:03.550
we don't have to have
these conversations

00:53:03.550 --> 00:53:07.580
because everyone is just doing
what they got to be doing.

00:53:07.580 --> 00:53:10.222
LINDA SARSOUR: I'm just going
to say just be uncomfortable

00:53:10.222 --> 00:53:11.680
and that being
uncomfortable is OK.

00:53:13.879 --> 00:53:14.920
MYOSHA MCAFEE: All right.

00:53:14.920 --> 00:53:16.930
Time for Q&amp;A.

00:53:16.930 --> 00:53:19.480
AUDIENCE: I'm curious
on your point of view

00:53:19.480 --> 00:53:25.644
as for the pro-life community
not being invited to the March.

00:53:25.644 --> 00:53:27.560
I'd just like to hear a
little bit about that.

00:53:27.560 --> 00:53:29.310
If you could talk a
little bit about that.

00:53:32.690 --> 00:53:35.110
LINDA SARSOUR: So that was
another manifested controversy,

00:53:35.110 --> 00:53:39.250
so an educational
moment for everyone.

00:53:39.250 --> 00:53:44.080
This was a pro-choice march.

00:53:44.080 --> 00:53:45.130
So let's say that again.

00:53:45.130 --> 00:53:47.800
This was a pro-choice march.

00:53:47.800 --> 00:53:50.470
That means that you
give women the agency

00:53:50.470 --> 00:53:53.380
to choose for themselves
whether or not

00:53:53.380 --> 00:53:55.600
they want to get an
abortion or whether or not

00:53:55.600 --> 00:53:56.980
they want to keep a baby.

00:53:56.980 --> 00:54:00.160
So what we were very
clear about from day one

00:54:00.160 --> 00:54:02.110
is that this was a
pro-choice march.

00:54:02.110 --> 00:54:06.081
So regardless of what your
personal opinion is about that,

00:54:06.081 --> 00:54:07.330
you were welcome to the march.

00:54:07.330 --> 00:54:09.790
What we were not going
to do is we were not

00:54:09.790 --> 00:54:13.700
going to allow specific
anti-choice groups, right?

00:54:13.700 --> 00:54:16.300
So there's a difference
between being whoever

00:54:16.300 --> 00:54:18.820
you are, and specifically
being against the woman's

00:54:18.820 --> 00:54:20.470
right to choose for her body.

00:54:20.470 --> 00:54:23.530
Because that is all
types of problematic.

00:54:23.530 --> 00:54:25.750
So this was a march that
brought people-- there were

00:54:25.750 --> 00:54:27.570
people there who were pro-life.

00:54:27.570 --> 00:54:29.230
So as long as you
don't take my right

00:54:29.230 --> 00:54:31.720
or want to work against my
right to choose for my own body.

00:54:31.720 --> 00:54:34.210
So that was the kind
of context in which

00:54:34.210 --> 00:54:37.120
we organized the Women's March.

00:54:37.120 --> 00:54:39.490
AUDIENCE: How do we balance
pushing the conversation

00:54:39.490 --> 00:54:42.790
deeper, but also keeping a door
open for those who are just

00:54:42.790 --> 00:54:45.010
now opening their eyes
and may feel "threatened,"

00:54:45.010 --> 00:54:48.031
quote unquote, by talking
about intersectionality?

00:54:52.262 --> 00:54:54.220
TANZINA VEGA: I think it
goes back to the point

00:54:54.220 --> 00:54:55.010
that I was making.

00:54:55.010 --> 00:54:57.370
I don't think anyone has to
walk out of the room saying,

00:54:57.370 --> 00:54:59.500
they, too, are
critical race scholars.

00:54:59.500 --> 00:55:02.590
Like no one's expecting
that after this chat.

00:55:02.590 --> 00:55:07.240
But I do think it's a question
of curiosity and openness

00:55:07.240 --> 00:55:09.686
to hearing and being
uncomfortable and asking

00:55:09.686 --> 00:55:10.810
the uncomfortable question.

00:55:10.810 --> 00:55:13.230
I'm surprised that there's
only one question in the room.

00:55:13.230 --> 00:55:15.730
I know there's probably a lot
of questions in people's minds

00:55:15.730 --> 00:55:18.490
right now, right, thinking
should I, shouldn't I?

00:55:18.490 --> 00:55:19.639
It's OK to ask it.

00:55:19.639 --> 00:55:22.180
Like I have these conversations
in the newsroom all the time.

00:55:22.180 --> 00:55:24.721
And I'd say I'd rather us have
the uncomfortable conversation

00:55:24.721 --> 00:55:28.390
now, behind the scenes, when
we're just trying to figure out

00:55:28.390 --> 00:55:31.540
this story or this video, than
broadcast something that's

00:55:31.540 --> 00:55:32.590
inaccurate.

00:55:35.560 --> 00:55:41.050
KIM CRENSHAW: I want to embrace
the idea of discomfort that

00:55:41.050 --> 00:55:45.700
has been put on the
table and normalize

00:55:45.700 --> 00:55:50.440
discomfort and denormalize
comfort with injustice.

00:55:50.440 --> 00:55:54.340
That's the real shift right now.

00:55:54.340 --> 00:55:58.990
I mean we could just take
an example of whatever space

00:55:58.990 --> 00:55:59.680
we're in.

00:55:59.680 --> 00:56:01.450
I teach at two law schools.

00:56:01.450 --> 00:56:05.830
Many times I am the only person
that looks like me in the room

00:56:05.830 --> 00:56:07.570
that I'm in.

00:56:07.570 --> 00:56:10.870
Never am I in a
room where there's

00:56:10.870 --> 00:56:14.920
anywhere close to parity
between people who look like me

00:56:14.920 --> 00:56:17.200
and the rest of the population.

00:56:17.200 --> 00:56:20.140
I think we're also sitting in
a room where if we were honest,

00:56:20.140 --> 00:56:22.150
we would look around
and say there's

00:56:22.150 --> 00:56:26.650
a certain lack of parity
between the way this space is

00:56:26.650 --> 00:56:28.780
constituted and
the world outside.

00:56:28.780 --> 00:56:30.760
It's not unique to Google.

00:56:30.760 --> 00:56:32.770
It's everywhere.

00:56:32.770 --> 00:56:35.140
And it's on every part of it.

00:56:35.140 --> 00:56:42.670
If you go to a family court, or
if you go to a benefit shelter,

00:56:42.670 --> 00:56:45.940
that place doesn't look
like the rest of America.

00:56:45.940 --> 00:56:50.860
So when we live in a society
when it's still predictable,

00:56:50.860 --> 00:56:53.290
by just looking at
someone, whether they're

00:56:53.290 --> 00:56:57.040
likely to be the CEO or
the person who cleans,

00:56:57.040 --> 00:57:01.390
we still have a hierarchy
that's racially coded.

00:57:01.390 --> 00:57:03.190
This is called
decoding race, right?

00:57:03.190 --> 00:57:06.490
You're not going to be able
to decode it if you don't know

00:57:06.490 --> 00:57:08.620
something needs to be decoded.

00:57:08.620 --> 00:57:10.930
It's not something out there.

00:57:10.930 --> 00:57:14.200
It's something everywhere
we happen to be.

00:57:14.200 --> 00:57:17.200
So the question is,
what kind of orientation

00:57:17.200 --> 00:57:22.000
do we want to have as we
began the process of decoding?

00:57:22.000 --> 00:57:24.040
Why do we want to decode?

00:57:24.040 --> 00:57:26.560
What are the questions
that we want to ask?

00:57:26.560 --> 00:57:29.320
I would say that some questions
that we might want to ask

00:57:29.320 --> 00:57:33.580
are, what are the societal
processes, the dynamics that

00:57:33.580 --> 00:57:35.500
create the space that we're in?

00:57:35.500 --> 00:57:37.180
How did it happen?

00:57:37.180 --> 00:57:40.110
And what story are
we telling ourselves

00:57:40.110 --> 00:57:41.750
if we're not asking
that question?

00:57:41.750 --> 00:57:43.840
Because you've got to
have a story about why

00:57:43.840 --> 00:57:45.400
your space looks the way it is.

00:57:45.400 --> 00:57:47.800
You've got to have a story
about why your neighborhood is

00:57:47.800 --> 00:57:49.120
made up the way it is.

00:57:49.120 --> 00:57:52.060
You've got to have a story about
why your church looks the way--

00:57:52.060 --> 00:57:53.200
you've got to have a story.

00:57:53.200 --> 00:57:55.750
You might not be telling
yourself what it is.

00:57:55.750 --> 00:57:57.610
But you have a story.

00:57:57.610 --> 00:58:01.390
And many times that story
is deeply problematic.

00:58:01.390 --> 00:58:03.490
It's often a story about
well, people are just

00:58:03.490 --> 00:58:05.380
choosing different things.

00:58:05.380 --> 00:58:08.170
Or people just have
different talents,

00:58:08.170 --> 00:58:11.140
or they have different
cultural habits.

00:58:11.140 --> 00:58:14.960
They have the ability to
withstand instant gratification

00:58:14.960 --> 00:58:15.759
is a story.

00:58:15.759 --> 00:58:17.300
I mean there are
all sorts of stories

00:58:17.300 --> 00:58:20.090
that we tell ourselves about
how our institutions look

00:58:20.090 --> 00:58:21.170
the way they do.

00:58:21.170 --> 00:58:23.510
And when we don't
challenge those stories,

00:58:23.510 --> 00:58:25.970
we reproduce those systems.

00:58:25.970 --> 00:58:29.780
Because we tend to reproduce the
same thing that got us there.

00:58:29.780 --> 00:58:35.270
When you're asking what
should the next CEO look like,

00:58:35.270 --> 00:58:38.720
or what should be a
qualification for doing x job,

00:58:38.720 --> 00:58:43.700
you're likely to base the answer
on what the system has already

00:58:43.700 --> 00:58:45.020
produced.

00:58:45.020 --> 00:58:46.700
But what that
system has produced

00:58:46.700 --> 00:58:48.990
didn't come out of nowhere.

00:58:48.990 --> 00:58:50.510
It wasn't something
that just got

00:58:50.510 --> 00:58:54.800
constituted without race and
without gender playing a role.

00:58:54.800 --> 00:59:00.440
So by saying discomfort, I mean
being uncomfortable not asking

00:59:00.440 --> 00:59:03.560
those questions-- being
uncomfortable just going along

00:59:03.560 --> 00:59:09.170
like it's all OK, being brave
enough to say it's up to us

00:59:09.170 --> 00:59:12.740
to decide how much of this
we can produce differently.

00:59:12.740 --> 00:59:18.110
How we can be creative about
how we conceptualize what

00:59:18.110 --> 00:59:21.470
a good candidate is,
to be creative enough

00:59:21.470 --> 00:59:24.380
to think about how this job
could be done differently,

00:59:24.380 --> 00:59:27.650
to be bold enough to
say we're not satisfied

00:59:27.650 --> 00:59:30.350
with our society
looking the way it does,

00:59:30.350 --> 00:59:32.930
or this institution
looking the way it does.

00:59:32.930 --> 00:59:34.820
It's those kind of
discomforts that I

00:59:34.820 --> 00:59:36.870
think we should want to create.

00:59:36.870 --> 00:59:40.040
And we should want to be
uncomfortable with not

00:59:40.040 --> 00:59:41.840
doing that.

00:59:41.840 --> 00:59:45.860
MYOSHA MCAFEE: Deep
inquiry and reflection.

00:59:45.860 --> 00:59:49.250
Other questions?

00:59:49.250 --> 00:59:51.686
AUDIENCE: So if I think about
what the many policies that

00:59:51.686 --> 00:59:53.310
bother me about the
new administration,

00:59:53.310 --> 00:59:55.731
it's the education,
school choice,

00:59:55.731 --> 00:59:58.230
and how that's going to impact
women of color in particular.

00:59:58.230 --> 01:00:00.780
So I just want to hear your
thoughts on what we can do,

01:00:00.780 --> 01:00:01.950
what you think that
impact could be,

01:00:01.950 --> 01:00:03.908
and how we can change
that trajectory possibly.

01:00:08.709 --> 01:00:10.750
KIM CRENSHAW: Well, I'll
start with just a couple

01:00:10.750 --> 01:00:12.180
of observations
I'm sure everyone

01:00:12.180 --> 01:00:14.610
has some thoughts about this.

01:00:14.610 --> 01:00:18.210
So I'm going to say a word
that gets talked about a lot,

01:00:18.210 --> 01:00:21.060
but isn't often defined.

01:00:21.060 --> 01:00:23.500
We're in a neoliberal moment.

01:00:23.500 --> 01:00:29.340
By that I'm trying to capture
the idea that everything

01:00:29.340 --> 01:00:31.830
is being reduced to markets.

01:00:31.830 --> 01:00:35.340
And in that, most things
are being privatized, which

01:00:35.340 --> 01:00:37.650
includes public education.

01:00:37.650 --> 01:00:41.700
So the moves that we're going
to be seeing in public education

01:00:41.700 --> 01:00:46.710
and in health and in
pretty much everything else

01:00:46.710 --> 01:00:49.950
are moves to greater and
greater privatization.

01:00:49.950 --> 01:00:52.590
With greater
privatization, typically

01:00:52.590 --> 01:00:56.100
has become greater
levels of inequality,

01:00:56.100 --> 01:00:59.370
greater levels of
hierarchy, greater levels

01:00:59.370 --> 01:01:01.470
of people of color
particularly not being

01:01:01.470 --> 01:01:03.480
able to make it to the top.

01:01:03.480 --> 01:01:07.860
So I think that we can more
or less predict the areas that

01:01:07.860 --> 01:01:12.720
will be more likely impactful
on communities of color

01:01:12.720 --> 01:01:14.400
are those areas
where people of color

01:01:14.400 --> 01:01:17.970
actually had a greater role
in the public production

01:01:17.970 --> 01:01:19.500
of the good.

01:01:19.500 --> 01:01:21.570
Education is one of them.

01:01:21.570 --> 01:01:23.700
Government in general
is another one.

01:01:23.700 --> 01:01:26.940
Why is it that people of color
actually are more in government

01:01:26.940 --> 01:01:28.080
than other places?

01:01:28.080 --> 01:01:31.170
Well, let's start
asking those questions.

01:01:31.170 --> 01:01:33.450
I think there are
clear answers to that,

01:01:33.450 --> 01:01:36.480
and consequently there are
clear answers to the outcome.

01:01:36.480 --> 01:01:38.880
I'll say this as
just a last point.

01:01:38.880 --> 01:01:40.650
Because I think
the tendency when

01:01:40.650 --> 01:01:44.130
people hear why are certain
institutions looking

01:01:44.130 --> 01:01:46.530
the way they do, including
the government, which

01:01:46.530 --> 01:01:49.690
is far more integrated
than private space,

01:01:49.690 --> 01:01:53.580
there is a sense that that's
the product of discrimination

01:01:53.580 --> 01:01:55.810
that happened a long time ago.

01:01:55.810 --> 01:01:58.500
I don't think there is a sense
that there are things happening

01:01:58.500 --> 01:02:00.090
right here and right now.

01:02:00.090 --> 01:02:02.160
They might not look
like the kind of things

01:02:02.160 --> 01:02:04.020
that we are used to before.

01:02:04.020 --> 01:02:05.391
There aren't white only signs.

01:02:05.391 --> 01:02:06.390
People aren't picketing.

01:02:06.390 --> 01:02:09.490
They're not throwing bricks
at Martin Luther King.

01:02:09.490 --> 01:02:13.290
But there are other ways in
which pipelines are racially

01:02:13.290 --> 01:02:17.550
constructed, so that, yes, more
people are in public education

01:02:17.550 --> 01:02:18.180
than private.

01:02:18.180 --> 01:02:21.540
Yes, more people are in
certain jobs than others.

01:02:21.540 --> 01:02:24.390
And then here's the last
thing, yes, more people

01:02:24.390 --> 01:02:26.970
have wealth than others.

01:02:26.970 --> 01:02:29.400
So Tanzina was talking
about the wealth gap.

01:02:29.400 --> 01:02:31.860
Let me add this last piece.

01:02:31.860 --> 01:02:36.270
Women of color have a median net
worth, Latinas and black women,

01:02:36.270 --> 01:02:38.730
of $0.

01:02:38.730 --> 01:02:42.840
I just want you to think
about what that means.

01:02:42.840 --> 01:02:45.450
Close to a majority
of women of color

01:02:45.450 --> 01:02:49.200
don't have the amount of wealth
that it takes to buy a Big Mac.

01:02:49.200 --> 01:02:53.610
I mean wealth is what you have
after all of your deficits,

01:02:53.610 --> 01:02:57.360
all your debts are
subtracted from your assets.

01:02:57.360 --> 01:03:00.420
Wealth is what allows you to
provide for your children.

01:03:00.420 --> 01:03:03.240
Wealth is what allows you to
take care of a sick parent

01:03:03.240 --> 01:03:05.130
and also send your
kid to summer camp.

01:03:05.130 --> 01:03:07.560
Wealth is what allows
you to move to a place

01:03:07.560 --> 01:03:09.510
where you can have
access to healthy food

01:03:09.510 --> 01:03:11.750
or you can have
access to recreation.

01:03:11.750 --> 01:03:15.900
Wealth is the thing that
allows you to actually sustain

01:03:15.900 --> 01:03:17.910
yourself during
the kind of crises

01:03:17.910 --> 01:03:21.900
that will always be happening
in an economy like ours.

01:03:21.900 --> 01:03:25.020
When we can say that one
part of our population

01:03:25.020 --> 01:03:27.210
has a median net
wealth of zero it's

01:03:27.210 --> 01:03:30.960
telling you that the pipelines
that their children will be in

01:03:30.960 --> 01:03:33.840
are not going to lead
to places like this.

01:03:33.840 --> 01:03:37.290
So it's going all the way
back to the baselines,

01:03:37.290 --> 01:03:42.210
who has what in this society,
and that's not natural.

01:03:42.210 --> 01:03:44.796
So maybe you know,
maybe you don't--

01:03:44.796 --> 01:03:47.730
at a time when the
government played the biggest

01:03:47.730 --> 01:03:49.740
role in creating
the neighborhoods

01:03:49.740 --> 01:03:54.000
we have was in the federal
housing, the creation

01:03:54.000 --> 01:03:55.590
of federal housing.

01:03:55.590 --> 01:04:01.620
They spent $120 billion,
these are in 1940s dollars,

01:04:01.620 --> 01:04:03.510
to create suburbs.

01:04:03.510 --> 01:04:06.540
These suburbs were created
as all white enclaves

01:04:06.540 --> 01:04:08.410
by the government.

01:04:08.410 --> 01:04:11.130
So what does it mean to have
bought a house in the suburbs

01:04:11.130 --> 01:04:18.000
in 1940, for let's say,
$25,000 versus being forced

01:04:18.000 --> 01:04:22.410
to live in a ghetto for about
the same amount in terms

01:04:22.410 --> 01:04:24.200
of your monthly housing costs?

01:04:24.200 --> 01:04:26.830
That gave you a difference
between having a house back

01:04:26.830 --> 01:04:28.240
then and an apartment.

01:04:28.240 --> 01:04:30.210
But now, three
generations later,

01:04:30.210 --> 01:04:32.260
the one who bought the house?

01:04:32.260 --> 01:04:34.650
What are they able to
do with that equity?

01:04:34.650 --> 01:04:36.550
They can send kids to college.

01:04:36.550 --> 01:04:38.970
They can send kids
to graduate school.

01:04:38.970 --> 01:04:41.880
You can go around the
world if you want to.

01:04:41.880 --> 01:04:45.360
The family that had to
settle for the apartment

01:04:45.360 --> 01:04:47.520
in the ghetto, probably
still is living

01:04:47.520 --> 01:04:49.616
in an apartment in a ghetto.

01:04:49.616 --> 01:04:51.240
We'll look at that
and say, well, those

01:04:51.240 --> 01:04:54.660
are just natural realities.

01:04:54.660 --> 01:04:57.240
They are the product
of public policy,

01:04:57.240 --> 01:04:59.340
so the point is,
if public policy

01:04:59.340 --> 01:05:04.530
can create racialized class,
then it can uncreate it.

01:05:04.530 --> 01:05:06.870
We just have to be willing
to see that these are

01:05:06.870 --> 01:05:08.660
the products of public policy.

01:05:08.660 --> 01:05:10.160
That's the challenge
that I'm trying

01:05:10.160 --> 01:05:12.449
to encourage everybody to do.

01:05:12.449 --> 01:05:14.990
TANZINA VEGA: And I want you to
think on an individual level,

01:05:14.990 --> 01:05:15.160
too.

01:05:15.160 --> 01:05:15.868
Yeah, please.

01:05:15.868 --> 01:05:22.570
[APPLAUSE]

01:05:22.570 --> 01:05:24.730
I mentioned before I grew
up in public housing.

01:05:24.730 --> 01:05:26.720
I also went to public school.

01:05:26.720 --> 01:05:27.820
I have a master's degree.

01:05:27.820 --> 01:05:30.030
I have an undergraduate degree.

01:05:30.030 --> 01:05:31.840
And those are all
from public school.

01:05:31.840 --> 01:05:33.980
And why is that the case?

01:05:33.980 --> 01:05:36.520
Because it was a
financial decision.

01:05:36.520 --> 01:05:38.740
You wouldn't think that
because of where I work

01:05:38.740 --> 01:05:40.930
and like I said,
the big fancy job.

01:05:40.930 --> 01:05:45.190
And I hope you like my
outfit, things like that.

01:05:45.190 --> 01:05:48.550
But the fact of the matter is
growing up in that environment,

01:05:48.550 --> 01:05:51.462
without having that
equity to pass on,

01:05:51.462 --> 01:05:53.420
it doesn't only afford
you those opportunities,

01:05:53.420 --> 01:05:54.870
it means I can't take a break.

01:05:54.870 --> 01:05:57.590
It's very hard to take a break.

01:05:57.590 --> 01:06:00.370
I want you guys to understand
when you're looking at resumes,

01:06:00.370 --> 01:06:02.070
because this comes up a lot,
especially when you're thinking

01:06:02.070 --> 01:06:03.760
we've got to hire brown people.

01:06:03.760 --> 01:06:04.269
Right?

01:06:04.269 --> 01:06:05.810
We've got to hire
these brown people.

01:06:05.810 --> 01:06:06.940
So you're looking at
all the brown people

01:06:06.940 --> 01:06:08.148
that work in your department.

01:06:08.148 --> 01:06:10.510
And you're like, they've
got to know somebody, right?

01:06:10.510 --> 01:06:13.051
And then you get all the resumes
in, and then the first thing

01:06:13.051 --> 01:06:15.760
you do, and I know you all
do this is look for what?

01:06:18.510 --> 01:06:22.282
Harvard, Stanford,
yada, yada, we're

01:06:22.282 --> 01:06:23.490
going to go on and on, right?

01:06:23.490 --> 01:06:25.170
But do you look at
state university?

01:06:25.170 --> 01:06:25.720
Uh uh.

01:06:25.720 --> 01:06:26.220
That's out.

01:06:26.220 --> 01:06:28.680
That's in the circular
file immediately, right?

01:06:28.680 --> 01:06:32.730
Right there you're
eliminating a talent pool

01:06:32.730 --> 01:06:34.830
that you haven't
even considered.

01:06:34.830 --> 01:06:36.540
And there's nothing
wrong with Harvard

01:06:36.540 --> 01:06:39.450
and Stanford and Columbia and
all these wonderful places.

01:06:39.450 --> 01:06:41.370
I'll be potentially
teaching at some

01:06:41.370 --> 01:06:42.780
of those places in my future.

01:06:42.780 --> 01:06:46.050
So the fact of the matter is
these are amazing institutions,

01:06:46.050 --> 01:06:48.455
but we cannot
continue to assume,

01:06:48.455 --> 01:06:50.580
especially when you're
looking for talent of color,

01:06:50.580 --> 01:06:53.490
you're only looking
for the unicorn.

01:06:53.490 --> 01:06:55.560
The unicorns are
amazing but unicorns

01:06:55.560 --> 01:06:58.230
live in many different
parts of this population.

01:06:58.230 --> 01:07:00.960
I guarantee you that
you get somebody who's

01:07:00.960 --> 01:07:03.210
worked so hard to get there.

01:07:03.210 --> 01:07:07.200
And to them getting a job at
Google or at "The New York

01:07:07.200 --> 01:07:09.690
Times" or one of these
places, it's like--

01:07:09.690 --> 01:07:12.060
I mean it's unthinkable.

01:07:12.060 --> 01:07:15.030
You're creating a
pathway to prosperity.

01:07:15.030 --> 01:07:18.480
You're creating a change
in someone's class level

01:07:18.480 --> 01:07:19.262
potentially.

01:07:19.262 --> 01:07:21.720
And that's not to say that it's
magic, and all of a sudden.

01:07:21.720 --> 01:07:24.390
Because I have that
fancy job, and I'm not,

01:07:24.390 --> 01:07:26.670
my net worth isn't like--

01:07:26.670 --> 01:07:28.710
believe me I'm still
shopping discount.

01:07:28.710 --> 01:07:30.365
But the point is
that that matters.

01:07:30.365 --> 01:07:32.490
And you all, again, bringing
it back to yourselves,

01:07:32.490 --> 01:07:35.090
really take a look at when
you're examining people.

01:07:35.090 --> 01:07:36.870
Because that's a big
part of, I think,

01:07:36.870 --> 01:07:40.270
where we tend to block a
black person or Latino person,

01:07:40.270 --> 01:07:43.620
but only if they went to
da, da, da, da, da place.

01:07:43.620 --> 01:07:45.010
It eliminates too many people.

01:07:47.680 --> 01:07:50.130
AUDIENCE: It seems like the
media is attending to whatever

01:07:50.130 --> 01:07:52.450
is the most important to
the most people at that

01:07:52.450 --> 01:07:56.770
time, which leads to a very
reactionary type of response

01:07:56.770 --> 01:07:58.700
from everyone.

01:07:58.700 --> 01:07:59.630
How do we avoid that?

01:07:59.630 --> 01:08:02.770
How do we be more proactive and
avoid this sort of firefighting

01:08:02.770 --> 01:08:04.990
mentality where we're
only attacking the issues

01:08:04.990 --> 01:08:06.250
that Twitter cares about?

01:08:06.250 --> 01:08:08.045
TANZINA VEGA: Thank
you for that question.

01:08:08.045 --> 01:08:09.670
I'm assuming you
wanted me to answer it

01:08:09.670 --> 01:08:13.972
as a member of the media,
the mainstream media.

01:08:13.972 --> 01:08:15.820
Woo!

01:08:15.820 --> 01:08:21.055
All right, I tell people I
was just on a panel a week ago

01:08:21.055 --> 01:08:23.050
for this talk on
race and policing.

01:08:23.050 --> 01:08:25.479
And a similar
question was raised.

01:08:25.479 --> 01:08:27.700
And I said you, as
media consumers,

01:08:27.700 --> 01:08:31.990
have a tremendous
amount of power.

01:08:31.990 --> 01:08:33.160
I'll give you the example.

01:08:33.160 --> 01:08:38.590
At "The New York Times," I
created the race beat in 2013.

01:08:38.590 --> 01:08:41.571
I said, went to the then
executive editor Jill Abramson,

01:08:41.571 --> 01:08:43.029
and said, look,
I've got this idea.

01:08:43.029 --> 01:08:44.570
I think these stories
are doing well.

01:08:44.570 --> 01:08:47.380
This is pre-Ferguson, just
so we have a timeline.

01:08:47.380 --> 01:08:49.100
So, oh, yeah, this
is a great idea.

01:08:49.100 --> 01:08:49.600
Let's do it.

01:08:49.600 --> 01:08:50.330
I said great.

01:08:50.330 --> 01:08:53.679
I went from doing what I
was doing on the media desk

01:08:53.679 --> 01:08:54.934
to covering this beat.

01:08:54.934 --> 01:08:56.350
And I think I was
the first Latina

01:08:56.350 --> 01:08:59.170
to found a beat like
that at "The Times."

01:08:59.170 --> 01:09:01.810
Not to say "The Times" hadn't
covered race in the past,

01:09:01.810 --> 01:09:02.830
it had.

01:09:02.830 --> 01:09:07.220
But it had been about 13 years
since they did it systemically.

01:09:07.220 --> 01:09:09.760
And so I was suggesting that
we sit down and have me do it

01:09:09.760 --> 01:09:13.310
and kick it off, and that
I think went very well.

01:09:13.310 --> 01:09:15.240
We had a lot of great stories.

01:09:15.240 --> 01:09:16.870
You can look them
up yourselves look

01:09:16.870 --> 01:09:20.290
I've covered everything from
black women and discipline

01:09:20.290 --> 01:09:24.100
in schools to Asian-American
elder care issues to how

01:09:24.100 --> 01:09:26.470
Arab-Americans and Latino
Americans are answering

01:09:26.470 --> 01:09:29.200
the census form, like
who's white, who's not.

01:09:29.200 --> 01:09:31.640
I mean we sort of went all over.

01:09:31.640 --> 01:09:34.479
And these stories got
really good responses.

01:09:34.479 --> 01:09:37.120
After about a year,
"The Times" decided

01:09:37.120 --> 01:09:39.670
we don't need this beat,
for whatever reason,

01:09:39.670 --> 01:09:41.050
and we're killing it.

01:09:41.050 --> 01:09:45.040
What they didn't realize,
and what I told them was,

01:09:45.040 --> 01:09:47.582
this isn't going to sit
well with our audience.

01:09:47.582 --> 01:09:48.290
Well, guess what?

01:09:48.290 --> 01:09:49.330
It didn't.

01:09:49.330 --> 01:09:52.720
The audience took to Twitter.

01:09:52.720 --> 01:09:54.310
We had a public
editor at "The Times,"

01:09:54.310 --> 01:09:56.215
an ombudsman at "The Times."

01:09:56.215 --> 01:09:58.090
At that time, it was
Margaret Sullivan, who's

01:09:58.090 --> 01:09:59.780
now at "The Washington Post."

01:09:59.780 --> 01:10:04.210
And just email, just
people were just like done.

01:10:04.210 --> 01:10:06.670
Like they were like, what
are you talking about?

01:10:06.670 --> 01:10:10.957
And it just became this huge
issue where the public editor

01:10:10.957 --> 01:10:13.540
called and said, look, I've got
to cover this for "The Times."

01:10:13.540 --> 01:10:16.360
So that's not awkward, right,
I'm working at the company,

01:10:16.360 --> 01:10:20.862
but now I'm going to be the
subject of an internal public--

01:10:20.862 --> 01:10:22.570
not a review, but
really it's essentially

01:10:22.570 --> 01:10:24.144
an answer to our public.

01:10:24.144 --> 01:10:26.560
That's what the ombudsman is
for to say, wait, everybody's

01:10:26.560 --> 01:10:27.220
upset.

01:10:27.220 --> 01:10:32.680
Let's interview and hold this
institution's feet to the fire.

01:10:32.680 --> 01:10:36.730
At the center of that,
totally cool, not a problem.

01:10:36.730 --> 01:10:38.380
It was very difficult
to see that,

01:10:38.380 --> 01:10:41.500
but it was also really
heartening to show that wow,

01:10:41.500 --> 01:10:42.550
we get results.

01:10:42.550 --> 01:10:43.870
Your readers can get results.

01:10:43.870 --> 01:10:45.940
It was covered in
"Columbia Journalism

01:10:45.940 --> 01:10:50.961
Review," NPR, "National Review,"
I mean all these places--

01:10:50.961 --> 01:10:51.460
I'm sorry.

01:10:51.460 --> 01:10:53.210
"The New Republic,"
not "National Review."

01:10:53.210 --> 01:10:55.520
That would have been
a whole other story.

01:10:55.520 --> 01:10:58.749
So we got a lot of
coverage about this issue.

01:10:58.749 --> 01:11:00.040
And I wasn't being interviewed.

01:11:00.040 --> 01:11:02.770
It was just about
the issue at large.

01:11:02.770 --> 01:11:05.140
So long story short,
they brought it back.

01:11:05.140 --> 01:11:07.840
I left, but they
brought it back.

01:11:07.840 --> 01:11:09.880
And now they're attempting
in their own way

01:11:09.880 --> 01:11:12.820
to try and cover
race in America.

01:11:12.820 --> 01:11:14.500
I wish them the best.

01:11:14.500 --> 01:11:17.140
But I look at that
as an opportunity.

01:11:17.140 --> 01:11:19.910
And it was really interesting
to see the audience say, wait

01:11:19.910 --> 01:11:20.410
a minute.

01:11:20.410 --> 01:11:21.860
This is not what we want.

01:11:21.860 --> 01:11:24.730
So you guys have a
tremendous amount of power.

01:11:24.730 --> 01:11:27.730
You also are inundated
with media left and right

01:11:27.730 --> 01:11:31.460
from every corner of
the world at this point.

01:11:31.460 --> 01:11:33.790
I'm considering taking
Twitter off my phone,

01:11:33.790 --> 01:11:35.090
because I just can't.

01:11:35.090 --> 01:11:37.759
And I have to do
this for a living.

01:11:37.759 --> 01:11:39.550
You have to pay attention
to the people who

01:11:39.550 --> 01:11:42.190
are writing the content
or shooting the content

01:11:42.190 --> 01:11:44.590
or making the content that
you want to see and support

01:11:44.590 --> 01:11:48.310
that content, whether it
means subscribing, watching,

01:11:48.310 --> 01:11:51.430
clicking, e-mailing, sending
a letter to the editor,

01:11:51.430 --> 01:11:52.540
or whatever it is.

01:11:52.540 --> 01:11:56.716
Because ultimately that's
how you change the narrative.

01:11:56.716 --> 01:11:58.090
That's the work
I'm trying to do.

01:11:58.090 --> 01:11:59.340
It was shut down at one place.

01:11:59.340 --> 01:12:00.506
I brought it someplace else.

01:12:00.506 --> 01:12:02.740
And said all right, maybe
it won't be shut down here.

01:12:02.740 --> 01:12:07.341
But I'm just one of x thousands
and thousands of voices

01:12:07.341 --> 01:12:07.840
out there.

01:12:07.840 --> 01:12:11.830
So I try to do my part
and elevate my stories

01:12:11.830 --> 01:12:14.410
and signal boost my stories
to get out there and try

01:12:14.410 --> 01:12:16.494
to tell these narratives
that aren't getting told.

01:12:16.494 --> 01:12:19.118
And there are many other people
that are trying to do the same,

01:12:19.118 --> 01:12:20.530
but they need to be supported.

01:12:23.412 --> 01:12:24.870
LINDA SARSOUR: So
I think sometimes

01:12:24.870 --> 01:12:26.280
we're asked to do either-or.

01:12:26.280 --> 01:12:28.380
I think we do kind of
still have to be prepared

01:12:28.380 --> 01:12:30.030
to do rapid response in crisis.

01:12:30.030 --> 01:12:32.190
Like people always
say to me, why

01:12:32.190 --> 01:12:34.560
are you always outraged
when black people

01:12:34.560 --> 01:12:35.846
are killed by the police?

01:12:35.846 --> 01:12:36.970
Like that's just how it is.

01:12:36.970 --> 01:12:39.240
And I say to people,
look, it is how it is.

01:12:39.240 --> 01:12:40.197
It's been how it is.

01:12:40.197 --> 01:12:41.280
But I want to be outraged.

01:12:41.280 --> 01:12:42.990
And don't take my
humanity away from me

01:12:42.990 --> 01:12:44.659
and tell me that I
shouldn't be outraged

01:12:44.659 --> 01:12:46.950
every time a black person is
killed at the hands of law

01:12:46.950 --> 01:12:48.040
enforcement.

01:12:48.040 --> 01:12:50.330
So what Twitter has
done, it has its benefits

01:12:50.330 --> 01:12:54.090
in that it allows me, sitting
in Brooklyn, New York,

01:12:54.090 --> 01:12:56.460
to figure out that there
is a young man named

01:12:56.460 --> 01:12:59.320
Mike Brown in Ferguson that just
got shot by a police officer.

01:12:59.320 --> 01:13:02.010
It allows me to be connected
to those very human stories

01:13:02.010 --> 01:13:04.485
that if we as a
society don't elevate,

01:13:04.485 --> 01:13:06.210
ain't nobody care
about Mike Brown.

01:13:06.210 --> 01:13:08.070
Nobody cares about Sandra Bland.

01:13:08.070 --> 01:13:11.070
So it really is props to the
young people who figured out

01:13:11.070 --> 01:13:14.240
to take a public platform
to basically be able to say

01:13:14.240 --> 01:13:16.020
you will not ignore our pain.

01:13:16.020 --> 01:13:18.750
You will not ignore the blood
on the streets in our community.

01:13:18.750 --> 01:13:21.360
So there is that
opportunity to just

01:13:21.360 --> 01:13:23.400
be able to say, yes,
maybe Sandra Bland

01:13:23.400 --> 01:13:25.410
was a trending hashtag.

01:13:25.410 --> 01:13:26.610
Praise the Lord that it was.

01:13:26.610 --> 01:13:28.260
Because I would have
never learned her story.

01:13:28.260 --> 01:13:30.240
I would have never been
able to say her name.

01:13:30.240 --> 01:13:33.400
But to the other parallel
that we could use,

01:13:33.400 --> 01:13:34.830
I'm always in crisis response.

01:13:34.830 --> 01:13:36.900
Like I'm always ready
to do rapid response.

01:13:36.900 --> 01:13:38.520
But I also understand
the importance

01:13:38.520 --> 01:13:41.010
of building longevity and
building sustainability

01:13:41.010 --> 01:13:42.180
in our communities.

01:13:42.180 --> 01:13:44.760
So while we're not
organizing for Sandra Bland,

01:13:44.760 --> 01:13:46.579
how are we preventing
another black woman

01:13:46.579 --> 01:13:48.120
from getting shot
by a police officer

01:13:48.120 --> 01:13:53.340
or being killed in a cell
in custody of our state,

01:13:53.340 --> 01:13:54.170
basically.

01:13:54.170 --> 01:13:56.290
And I think what we
often do is we get--

01:13:56.290 --> 01:13:58.080
and this is why I
always say to people,

01:13:58.080 --> 01:13:59.880
ain't no time for
part-time progressives,

01:13:59.880 --> 01:14:01.464
ain't no time for
part-time activists.

01:14:01.464 --> 01:14:03.463
You're either coming in
here to invest your time

01:14:03.463 --> 01:14:05.010
or you get out of
our way, because I

01:14:05.010 --> 01:14:08.670
don't want to see you, right,
at that protest that one time.

01:14:08.670 --> 01:14:11.040
I'm not saying that that's
not beneficial to show up.

01:14:11.040 --> 01:14:13.262
But I want to know
where you are tomorrow,

01:14:13.262 --> 01:14:14.220
and the day after that.

01:14:14.220 --> 01:14:16.230
Because when you leave
here, there's still

01:14:16.230 --> 01:14:17.630
someone else that's impacted.

01:14:17.630 --> 01:14:20.040
That person has not
come back to life.

01:14:20.040 --> 01:14:23.550
And oftentimes those very
people that we protest for still

01:14:23.550 --> 01:14:24.610
don't get justice.

01:14:24.610 --> 01:14:27.990
Everybody-- you can name any
trending hashtag in the past

01:14:27.990 --> 01:14:29.400
year and a half--

01:14:29.400 --> 01:14:31.620
not one of those
people got justice.

01:14:31.620 --> 01:14:34.590
So we didn't even win
those smaller fights.

01:14:34.590 --> 01:14:38.250
So being able to organize,
being able to give resources

01:14:38.250 --> 01:14:40.560
to the very local organizations
on the ground in places

01:14:40.560 --> 01:14:43.030
like Ferguson, being
able to say, OK,

01:14:43.030 --> 01:14:45.480
who's in Texas organizing
around Sandra Bland.

01:14:45.480 --> 01:14:47.500
What kind of resources
do those people need?

01:14:47.500 --> 01:14:49.860
How can I as a Googler
be able to provide?

01:14:49.860 --> 01:14:52.110
Maybe I can't do it in
my official capacity,

01:14:52.110 --> 01:14:53.289
but I may be an engineer.

01:14:53.289 --> 01:14:55.080
I may know how to build
a website for them.

01:14:55.080 --> 01:14:58.500
I may know how to help
them fix their algorithm so

01:14:58.500 --> 01:15:00.840
that whatever story they got
is going out even farther.

01:15:00.840 --> 01:15:02.950
We all got something to
give to the movement.

01:15:02.950 --> 01:15:05.220
So for me, it's
like yes, show up.

01:15:05.220 --> 01:15:06.210
Yes, be outraged.

01:15:06.210 --> 01:15:08.017
It's OK that there's
a trending hashtag.

01:15:08.017 --> 01:15:09.600
The question is,
what are you offering

01:15:09.600 --> 01:15:11.490
so that next time,
god forbid, there

01:15:11.490 --> 01:15:13.650
is to be something that
happens in that community,

01:15:13.650 --> 01:15:16.170
they got more resources
than they had six months ago

01:15:16.170 --> 01:15:18.690
when another person went
down in their community.

01:15:18.690 --> 01:15:22.230
So I think for me, it's like
we could stay rapid response

01:15:22.230 --> 01:15:23.100
and crisis response.

01:15:23.100 --> 01:15:24.930
And we, by the way, are going
to have to do a lot of that

01:15:24.930 --> 01:15:26.255
under this administration.

01:15:26.255 --> 01:15:28.080
Just letting y'all
know, get ready.

01:15:28.080 --> 01:15:28.890
I'm already tired.

01:15:28.890 --> 01:15:30.580
It's only been in
like five weeks.

01:15:30.580 --> 01:15:34.770
But really understanding,
like communities of color,

01:15:34.770 --> 01:15:36.651
we just are always
like, oh, man.

01:15:36.651 --> 01:15:38.150
We're just being
hit from every way,

01:15:38.150 --> 01:15:39.900
and we never just get
the time to be left.

01:15:39.900 --> 01:15:42.120
We would like to reflect
and have a retreat

01:15:42.120 --> 01:15:45.570
and figure out how to do asset
mapping and what we need.

01:15:45.570 --> 01:15:47.640
And we try that, we attempt it.

01:15:47.640 --> 01:15:49.927
The minute we leave
that retreat on Monday,

01:15:49.927 --> 01:15:51.510
someone else is shot
in our community,

01:15:51.510 --> 01:15:53.080
a family is about
to be deported,

01:15:53.080 --> 01:15:56.040
a mosque is vandalized,
this one gets--

01:15:56.040 --> 01:15:58.290
we just are always distracted.

01:15:58.290 --> 01:16:00.810
So the question for us is how
do we build sustainability,

01:16:00.810 --> 01:16:02.900
and then how do our
white allies, who

01:16:02.900 --> 01:16:06.450
aren't easily distracted
because they don't have

01:16:06.450 --> 01:16:10.800
the same priorities or they're
not as directly impacted as we

01:16:10.800 --> 01:16:13.560
are, which was why the
Women's March on Washington

01:16:13.560 --> 01:16:14.940
was as successful as it is.

01:16:14.940 --> 01:16:17.454
I'll give you an example.

01:16:17.454 --> 01:16:18.870
A lot of the people
that did the--

01:16:18.870 --> 01:16:21.203
so for example, graphic
designer was like, we coming in.

01:16:21.203 --> 01:16:23.275
We're going to do your branding.

01:16:23.275 --> 01:16:24.150
I didn't have to ask.

01:16:24.150 --> 01:16:26.710
I was like just, I would
have just slapped anything.

01:16:26.710 --> 01:16:28.230
I don't even care.

01:16:28.230 --> 01:16:30.750
The website, the
social media, people

01:16:30.750 --> 01:16:31.854
who were like, we got you.

01:16:31.854 --> 01:16:32.520
You do the work.

01:16:32.520 --> 01:16:33.810
You set the policy agenda.

01:16:33.810 --> 01:16:35.601
You do the outreach,
you call the partners,

01:16:35.601 --> 01:16:36.780
you do what you're good at.

01:16:36.780 --> 01:16:39.010
We'll do all that other
technological-- whatever.

01:16:39.010 --> 01:16:41.010
And a lot of these people
do work at tech firms.

01:16:41.010 --> 01:16:43.197
And that's why we had
such a big apparatus.

01:16:43.197 --> 01:16:45.780
And people were like, where did
they get those resources from?

01:16:45.780 --> 01:16:47.460
It cost us zero.

01:16:47.460 --> 01:16:49.410
It was people who own
tech firms and said

01:16:49.410 --> 01:16:50.250
this is what we want to do.

01:16:50.250 --> 01:16:52.041
This is what we want
to offer the movement.

01:16:52.041 --> 01:16:54.090
And by the way,
those same people

01:16:54.090 --> 01:16:56.280
didn't bounce on January 21st.

01:16:56.280 --> 01:17:00.090
Those people are still
maintaining the infrastructure,

01:17:00.090 --> 01:17:03.099
hosting our website, making sure
that our stuff is maintained,

01:17:03.099 --> 01:17:04.140
that it's still up today.

01:17:04.140 --> 01:17:07.050
So think about
being able to say,

01:17:07.050 --> 01:17:09.870
it's OK to be doing rapid
response and crisis response,

01:17:09.870 --> 01:17:12.720
but how do we think about
longevity, sustainability,

01:17:12.720 --> 01:17:15.780
and building a movement
that lives outside of us

01:17:15.780 --> 01:17:20.040
and lives beyond every
individual case of outrage

01:17:20.040 --> 01:17:22.419
that we are in
almost on a daily.

01:17:22.419 --> 01:17:23.460
MYOSHA MCAFEE: All right.

01:17:23.460 --> 01:17:25.910
So let's thank our
panelists first.

01:17:25.910 --> 01:17:34.730
[APPLAUSE]

01:17:34.730 --> 01:17:37.080
And because this
is Google, I know

01:17:37.080 --> 01:17:38.770
some takeaways I just
want to land with.

01:17:38.770 --> 01:17:41.660
I tried to summarize some of the
points that you all laid out.

01:17:41.660 --> 01:17:43.934
And I think you're
wondering what can I

01:17:43.934 --> 01:17:44.850
walk out of here with.

01:17:44.850 --> 01:17:46.230
I think the first
piece of advice

01:17:46.230 --> 01:17:48.790
is the current status quo
that we have right now,

01:17:48.790 --> 01:17:50.394
to not see it as normal.

01:17:50.394 --> 01:17:51.810
So if you are
working in staffing,

01:17:51.810 --> 01:17:53.670
if you're working in
any type of organization

01:17:53.670 --> 01:17:55.180
where you're taking
a look at diversity,

01:17:55.180 --> 01:17:56.888
if you're taking a
look at whether or not

01:17:56.888 --> 01:17:59.220
this place is inclusive,
the way things

01:17:59.220 --> 01:18:01.200
exist right now is
something that was created.

01:18:01.200 --> 01:18:03.120
And it was created by
the people in the room,

01:18:03.120 --> 01:18:07.370
in the office, not some external
arm or some force outside of us

01:18:07.370 --> 01:18:08.400
that's being created.

01:18:08.400 --> 01:18:10.410
So I think Dr. Crenshaw
invited us to say,

01:18:10.410 --> 01:18:11.946
let's look at
what's here, what we

01:18:11.946 --> 01:18:13.320
see as normal, as
our day to day,

01:18:13.320 --> 01:18:15.260
and it's not something
that's normal.

01:18:15.260 --> 01:18:17.010
It's not something
that's out of my hands.

01:18:17.010 --> 01:18:18.870
And so engage in that
deep inquiry process

01:18:18.870 --> 01:18:20.460
of how is this created now.

01:18:20.460 --> 01:18:22.560
And then think about what
is my responsibility,

01:18:22.560 --> 01:18:24.399
I think was said a
few times up here.

01:18:24.399 --> 01:18:26.190
The second thing is to
develop an awareness

01:18:26.190 --> 01:18:27.606
of our own personal
power, so this

01:18:27.606 --> 01:18:29.574
sense that this is too
big for me to handle.

01:18:29.574 --> 01:18:31.740
I think we have great
examples of people who are all

01:18:31.740 --> 01:18:33.540
engaged in the work,
put their talent

01:18:33.540 --> 01:18:35.490
and their creativity
combined together

01:18:35.490 --> 01:18:36.990
to begin to disrupt things.

01:18:36.990 --> 01:18:38.850
Great examples of
that happening here.

01:18:38.850 --> 01:18:41.500
And you're human, just
as they're human, right?

01:18:41.500 --> 01:18:43.480
And what they can
do, you can do.

01:18:43.480 --> 01:18:45.480
The third thing is
actually, instead

01:18:45.480 --> 01:18:48.952
of asking the question of what
about me, when someone starts

01:18:48.952 --> 01:18:50.910
centering their experience,
to ask the question

01:18:50.910 --> 01:18:52.290
what can I offer?

01:18:52.290 --> 01:18:54.480
And really asking the
question of who around me

01:18:54.480 --> 01:18:57.360
is encountering multiple
forms of violence,

01:18:57.360 --> 01:18:59.527
multiple forms of
disadvantage, and it

01:18:59.527 --> 01:19:01.860
doesn't matter what your
identity is, but actually think

01:19:01.860 --> 01:19:02.850
about that.

01:19:02.850 --> 01:19:05.160
Particularly when we're
centering an issue that makes

01:19:05.160 --> 01:19:07.069
you personally uncomfortable.

01:19:07.069 --> 01:19:08.610
I just want to drive
that point home.

01:19:08.610 --> 01:19:10.068
If it makes you
uncomfortable, it's

01:19:10.068 --> 01:19:13.820
probably the issue we
need to be talking about.

01:19:13.820 --> 01:19:16.840
And then finally, I love this
last talk about infrastructure.

01:19:16.840 --> 01:19:18.060
So I know that people
are trying to figure out,

01:19:18.060 --> 01:19:19.620
given what their roles are,
particularly if they're

01:19:19.620 --> 01:19:22.170
technical in nature, or they
don't see the direct connection

01:19:22.170 --> 01:19:24.030
to it, really thinking about
what's my talent, what's

01:19:24.030 --> 01:19:25.170
my gift, what's my skill?

01:19:25.170 --> 01:19:28.001
And how can I lend it to
whatever the causes the issue

01:19:28.001 --> 01:19:28.500
is?

01:19:28.500 --> 01:19:30.420
And notice, she didn't
describe somebody

01:19:30.420 --> 01:19:31.740
going there and asking for it.

01:19:31.740 --> 01:19:33.614
She described
people who offered.

01:19:33.614 --> 01:19:35.280
And so really be
thinking about how do I

01:19:35.280 --> 01:19:38.410
step up in offering my talent
and gifts to this position.

01:19:38.410 --> 01:19:38.910
All right.

01:19:38.910 --> 01:19:39.810
Thank you all for your time.

01:19:39.810 --> 01:19:41.018
Thank you for your attention.

01:19:41.018 --> 01:19:44.060
