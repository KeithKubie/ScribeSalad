00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:51.540
goal is to be able to hook together any
 

00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:55.580
goal is to be able to hook together any
any order to any two organic groups and

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:55.590
any order to any two organic groups and
 

00:00:55.590 --> 00:01:00.380

we believe that our are you know we have

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:00.390
we believe that our are you know we have
 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:02.880
we believe that our are you know we have
covered a little more than halfway

00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:02.890
covered a little more than halfway
 

00:01:02.890 --> 00:01:06.660
covered a little more than halfway
through towards this goal but in each

00:01:06.660 --> 00:01:06.670
through towards this goal but in each
 

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:10.109
through towards this goal but in each
case as I said eventually it would be

00:01:10.109 --> 00:01:10.119
case as I said eventually it would be
 

00:01:10.119 --> 00:01:13.129

00:01:13.129 --> 00:01:13.139
very nice to replace memo with hydrogen
 

00:01:13.139 --> 00:01:16.889
very nice to replace memo with hydrogen
but to what extent we can do is our

00:01:16.889 --> 00:01:16.899
but to what extent we can do is our
 

00:01:16.899 --> 00:01:19.420
but to what extent we can do is our
remaining question

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:19.430
