1
00:00:00,390 --> 00:00:04,620
Now when you take a guy who's working as
a truck driver and he's making $50,000

2
00:00:04,621 --> 00:00:08,100
a year and you tell him that automation
is going to take away his job,

3
00:00:08,101 --> 00:00:10,770
but good news,
we're going to give you $12,000 a year.

4
00:00:11,010 --> 00:00:15,550
That's a substantial loss in
income and yeah, it leaves them.

5
00:00:16,010 --> 00:00:20,880
Yeah. It also leaves them with
this feeling of uselessness
or hopelessness that

6
00:00:21,210 --> 00:00:22,320
they're not contributing.
You know?

7
00:00:22,321 --> 00:00:27,321
I think one of the things that people
enjoy is a earning their own way.

8
00:00:27,750 --> 00:00:31,380
You know, they, they, people
don't, it sounds counterintuitive.

9
00:00:31,620 --> 00:00:35,670
People don't like free money. They'd
like a feeling of satisfaction of a job.

10
00:00:35,671 --> 00:00:38,590
Well done that they've created
something that they've done something.

11
00:00:39,240 --> 00:00:42,690
Yeah, you're 100% right. It's one reason
why we call this the freedom dividend.

12
00:00:43,020 --> 00:00:45,090
We say, look, it's not money for nothing.

13
00:00:45,091 --> 00:00:48,780
You're an owner and shareholder of the
richest country in the history of the

14
00:00:48,781 --> 00:00:53,400
world. Just like when I buy Verizon
or Microsoft, they send me a dividend.

15
00:00:53,550 --> 00:00:55,140
Like I don't complain about that.

16
00:00:55,500 --> 00:00:59,880
Like your now a shareholder in this
great nation and you get a dividend.

17
00:01:00,210 --> 00:01:01,890
But when I was with Dennis,

18
00:01:01,891 --> 00:01:06,300
the trucker who owns his own
trucking company in Iowa, uh,

19
00:01:06,690 --> 00:01:07,523
the,

20
00:01:09,500 --> 00:01:13,890
the role that job's playing in
truckers' lives is vital. And again,

21
00:01:13,891 --> 00:01:18,891
I'm a very data driven guy where
men deal with joblessness very,

22
00:01:19,171 --> 00:01:24,171
very poorly by the numbers we spend
between 40 and 75% of our time on the

23
00:01:24,991 --> 00:01:28,710
computer playing video games
or doing other things, uh,

24
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:33,300
are substance abuse, goes up, are
volunteering in the community, goes down,

25
00:01:33,301 --> 00:01:38,301
even though we have more time and we
generally spiral into antisocial and self

26
00:01:38,611 --> 00:01:42,540
destructive behaviors. Now this
is not something that's, uh,

27
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:46,380
experienced by women in the same
levels like women and joblessness.

28
00:01:46,410 --> 00:01:48,030
Women actually have more adaptable.

29
00:01:48,270 --> 00:01:51,420
They're more likely to go
back to school and volunteer.

30
00:01:51,421 --> 00:01:54,090
They don't spend all their time on
the computers the way that we do.

31
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:56,830
So there's a real problem.
Uh,

32
00:01:56,880 --> 00:02:01,880
and the purpose of universal basic income
is not meant to be a job replacement

33
00:02:02,580 --> 00:02:05,940
for those truckers because
right now those truckers,

34
00:02:05,941 --> 00:02:07,320
and when I talked to the truck drivers,

35
00:02:07,321 --> 00:02:10,290
so I've been campaigning for
president now for a number of months.

36
00:02:10,291 --> 00:02:13,260
So I spent a lot of time in Iowa,
which is a really huge trucking hub.

37
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:15,330
And you go to them and say,
hey guys,

38
00:02:15,331 --> 00:02:17,460
you worried about robot trucks
taking your jobs? They're like,

39
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:20,190
there's no way rubble. I could take
my job like that. That's, you know,

40
00:02:20,191 --> 00:02:22,440
that's like totally matter of
fact, they're like, they're like,

41
00:02:22,441 --> 00:02:24,570
this is not something
that they worry about.

42
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:30,420
Their attitude has transitioned
from that somewhat too. Uh,

43
00:02:30,540 --> 00:02:33,840
we should make robot trucks illegal or
we should make it so that a robot truck

44
00:02:33,841 --> 00:02:35,670
cannot displace me.

45
00:02:36,450 --> 00:02:40,800
So that's been a big shift because a
year ago they were like, it's impossible.

46
00:02:42,010 --> 00:02:47,010
The idea that an American would say
we should make a a robot job illegal.

47
00:02:48,190 --> 00:02:49,023
Like it's,

48
00:02:49,060 --> 00:02:54,060
we should have some laws that keep you
from being free to use robots for your

49
00:02:55,121 --> 00:02:57,070
business instead of person.

50
00:02:57,071 --> 00:03:00,580
Like you should be forced to
highly mandatory unionization

51
00:03:00,580 --> 00:03:03,100
or something. That sounds
pretty ridiculous. Well,

52
00:03:03,101 --> 00:03:07,570
that's where a lot of the Marjoe, uh,
so only 13% of truckers are unionized.

53
00:03:08,060 --> 00:03:11,830
So 87% are like Dennis where
there are small independent firms.

54
00:03:12,310 --> 00:03:16,150
And a lot of them actually, uh,
bought or leased their own trucks.

55
00:03:16,940 --> 00:03:20,560
So they took out tens of thousands of
dollars in the equivalent of a mortgage to

56
00:03:20,561 --> 00:03:24,670
get this truck. And so if they have
to compete against a robot truck,

57
00:03:24,671 --> 00:03:29,620
that doesn't stop. That's like, you
know, that's existential level stuff.

58
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:34,450
And right now truck drivers have time
use regulations where they cannot drive

59
00:03:34,451 --> 00:03:37,600
more than 14 hours a
day. Uh, so you can't,

60
00:03:37,630 --> 00:03:41,500
you literally cannot compete because
the robot trucks just gonna keep going.

61
00:03:41,530 --> 00:03:44,350
Our 15, 16, 17, et cetera.

62
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:48,040
So these guys make,
some of them make really good money.

63
00:03:48,041 --> 00:03:52,240
Like some of them make 70, 75, $80,000.
It's one of the higher paying jobs for,

64
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:56,050
um,
men without a college degree.

65
00:03:56,710 --> 00:04:00,970
And so if you look at what they're facing,
it's not so crazy that they're like,

66
00:04:00,971 --> 00:04:05,170
hey, you need to make the
robots illegal because for them,

67
00:04:05,171 --> 00:04:07,330
what is the next best
economic alternative?

68
00:04:07,720 --> 00:04:11,290
If the robot trucks take over that job,
like what are they going to go from? Yeah.

69
00:04:11,291 --> 00:04:12,460
It's not crazy for them,

70
00:04:12,461 --> 00:04:16,150
but it's a crazy idea to tell a company
that they can't do something that's more

71
00:04:16,151 --> 00:04:20,890
efficient, safer, and probably
economically more viable. Oh yeah.

72
00:04:20,891 --> 00:04:21,251
Again,

73
00:04:21,251 --> 00:04:26,251
the savings from automating truck driving
are estimated to be $168 billion per

74
00:04:27,371 --> 00:04:29,590
year and not just labor savings,

75
00:04:29,591 --> 00:04:33,940
but also equipment utilization because
the trucks never stop fuel efficiency

76
00:04:33,941 --> 00:04:36,850
because the trucks can daisy chain
together, so there's less wind resistance,

77
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:38,290
fewer accidents,

78
00:04:38,291 --> 00:04:42,460
cause right now truck accidents
kill about 4,000 people a year,

79
00:04:42,610 --> 00:04:44,410
so you'd probably save lives.
There's a very,

80
00:04:44,411 --> 00:04:48,430
very powerful argument for the fact that
we should be trying to automate this

81
00:04:48,431 --> 00:04:49,264
stuff,

82
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:52,780
but on the other side you have literally
three and a half million truckers who

83
00:04:52,781 --> 00:04:56,920
apply upon this further livelihoods to
support their family and there's going to

84
00:04:56,921 --> 00:05:00,160
be a lot of passion,
a lot of resistance to this.

85
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:02,530
Anyone who thinks that truck drivers
are just going to shrug and be like,

86
00:05:02,531 --> 00:05:06,280
all right, I guess I had a good run. I'm
just going to go home and figure it out.

87
00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:08,300
That's not going to be their response.
Right?

88
00:05:08,380 --> 00:05:11,410
It's going to be much more likely that
they say you need to make these robot

89
00:05:11,411 --> 00:05:15,340
trucks illegal or they're just going to
park their trucks across the highway,

90
00:05:15,550 --> 00:05:18,820
get their guns out. Cause a lot of these
guys are ex military and just be like,

91
00:05:18,821 --> 00:05:21,790
Hey, like I'm not moving my
truck until uh, you know,

92
00:05:21,820 --> 00:05:25,030
I get my job back and that there'll be
a lot of truckers in the same situation.

93
00:05:25,150 --> 00:05:26,440
You really think that would happen?

94
00:05:27,250 --> 00:05:31,360
Well I think they blocked the highway for
their job back. That's less efficient.

95
00:05:31,390 --> 00:05:36,370
Kills more people. So I was with these
truckers in the truck stop in Altoona,

96
00:05:36,371 --> 00:05:40,630
Iowa and Joe, they have really,
really difficult jobs. I mean,

97
00:05:40,631 --> 00:05:43,570
I don't know if you knew truckers
where you were, but they,

98
00:05:43,580 --> 00:05:47,080
they have this 14 hour window where
they're allowed to drive their truck and

99
00:05:47,081 --> 00:05:47,950
they drive most of that.

100
00:05:48,460 --> 00:05:50,950
So they have these other 10 hours
and they sleep in their truck,

101
00:05:51,260 --> 00:05:55,420
their trucks have a bed, they go into the
truck stop, they take a shower, you know,

102
00:05:55,590 --> 00:06:00,590
there's a laundry and they're like
plugged into this machine of this truck of

103
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:04,610
and, and the industry,
you know, they spend days,

104
00:06:04,611 --> 00:06:08,210
sometimes weeks on the road.
A lot of them listen to podcasts.

105
00:06:08,230 --> 00:06:09,980
Probably a lot of them
listening right now.

106
00:06:10,010 --> 00:06:13,410
A lot of them listened to podcasts and uh,

107
00:06:13,460 --> 00:06:17,480
they're doing it primarily because it's
a more lucrative opportunity than the

108
00:06:17,481 --> 00:06:20,960
other jobs that are available to them.
A lot of them have families that like,

109
00:06:20,961 --> 00:06:25,370
you know, like the support of their
families. Uh, and so if you say,

110
00:06:25,371 --> 00:06:30,140
hey guys, like, you know, Time's
up for, for this way of life.

111
00:06:31,310 --> 00:06:34,010
Most of them I think will
not like, uh, like, uh,

112
00:06:34,011 --> 00:06:37,250
actually I look at how much they
frankly they like into your,

113
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:42,260
there's so much endurance baked into that
job that I think most of them will be

114
00:06:42,500 --> 00:06:45,530
like some of the guys you and I know
where they're much more likely to like

115
00:06:45,620 --> 00:06:48,980
implode or like, you
know, do something where,

116
00:06:48,981 --> 00:06:53,370
where it's self destructive than they
would be to take their truck in La,

117
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:54,950
you know,
park it across the highway.

118
00:06:55,460 --> 00:06:58,700
But you're talking about a
population of hundreds of thousands,

119
00:06:59,060 --> 00:07:03,020
including many small business owners and
small business owners have a different

120
00:07:03,021 --> 00:07:06,230
mentality very often.
Like I've been an entrepreneur,

121
00:07:06,231 --> 00:07:08,480
I'm a serial entrepreneur
for the last 20 years.

122
00:07:08,481 --> 00:07:12,110
Like you're an entrepreneur and if you
saw this happen, you might say, Hey,

123
00:07:12,380 --> 00:07:16,190
I'm adaptable. I'll figure it
out. Or you might say, Hey,

124
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:21,770
I think I can do something about this.
Like if I parked my truck this way,

125
00:07:21,771 --> 00:07:25,280
like that's going to cause
such havoc that it's, you know,

126
00:07:25,281 --> 00:07:30,200
it's like hundreds of millions of dollars
worth of economic harm very, very fast.

127
00:07:30,620 --> 00:07:33,560
And if you look at the
industrial revolution,

128
00:07:33,561 --> 00:07:36,260
which people site as the precursor
to what we're going through,

129
00:07:36,890 --> 00:07:41,360
there were mass riots in the industrial
revolution that killed dozens of people,

130
00:07:41,390 --> 00:07:43,340
caused billions of
dollars worth of damage.

131
00:07:43,670 --> 00:07:46,640
Labor Day's a holiday today
because of those riots.

132
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:52,340
And then we implemented universal high
school in 1911 in part as a response to

133
00:07:52,341 --> 00:07:55,400
these riots.
So according to the estimates,

134
00:07:55,610 --> 00:07:57,680
this is called the fourth
industrial revolution,

135
00:07:57,740 --> 00:08:01,910
and we're going to displace jobs at
three to four times the rate of that

136
00:08:01,911 --> 00:08:02,960
industrial revolution.

137
00:08:03,500 --> 00:08:07,100
And that industrial revolution
included mass riots.

138
00:08:07,460 --> 00:08:11,510
So thinking that this one
will not strikes me as really,

139
00:08:11,511 --> 00:08:14,210
really optimistic and perhaps unrealistic.
