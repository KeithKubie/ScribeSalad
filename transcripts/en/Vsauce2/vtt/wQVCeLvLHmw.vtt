00:00:00.459 --> 00:00:05.390
Celebrate the summer with some patriotic rubber
ducks that you can float in your 4th of July

00:00:05.390 --> 00:00:11.360
inflatable cooler because it's episode 42
of LÃœT.

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:16.909
Watch sounds on your iPhone with this equalizer
phone case and transform your homework into

00:00:16.909 --> 00:00:21.669
something that's more than meets the eye with
one of these Transformer pens.

00:00:21.669 --> 00:00:25.989
For a different kind of transformation turn
your bottles into lamps with rechargeable

00:00:25.989 --> 00:00:28.329
lights shaped like corks.

00:00:28.329 --> 00:00:32.969
Then use this smart cup to figure out where
all of those empty bottles came from. The

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:37.870
Vessyl recognizes and tracks everything that
you drink including caffeine levels, nutritional

00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:41.510
values, and can even distinguish between brands.

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:44.870
Or just play with your drinks by shooting
some hoops with this one instead. Then pack

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:50.579
your cookies that taste like cupcakes inside
a peanut butter and jelly sandwich... storage

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:50.690
pocket.

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:57.039
For a no mess friend play with blob and flow
light up pets that plug in via USB and respond

00:00:57.039 --> 00:01:02.370
with different light sequences depending on
the touch or just use emergency googly eyes

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:04.820
to bring anything inanimate to life.

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:09.299
For something life-less decorate with this
unicorn head plaque and display it next to

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:12.270
your preserved sheep's heart..... uhhhh

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:16.450
After completing the required operating course
you can purchase your own flyboard that can

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:22.140
rocket you 45 feet out of the water and finally
help you swim like a dolphin.

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:27.399
For something big but not quite as expensive
you can sail the skies in this giant 3D pirate

00:01:27.399 --> 00:01:32.439
ship kite or win the World Cup of giants with
this huge soccer ball.

00:01:32.439 --> 00:01:37.329
Kick back and let a drone catch the action
with Airdog, an auto-follow air drone that

00:01:37.329 --> 00:01:42.219
works with a GoPro camera. Just attach a small
waterproof programmable tracker called the

00:01:42.219 --> 00:01:46.560
air leash and the quadcopter will follow your
coordinates wherever you go.

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:51.570
Check in on your Fridgezoo fridge pets and
sit down for a snack of canned dragon and

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:54.850
candy sushi while you read your paper later.

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:59.320
A service from the Newspaper club that prints
your desired articles from the internet into

00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:04.380
a physical newspaper and sends it to you via
snail mail. It's currently only available

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:07.880
in the UK but they plan to expand to other
areas soon.

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:13.530
Conquer new territory with this bow and arrow
that shoots marshmallows and a 14 in 1 survival

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:19.750
watch that includes a compass, bottle opener,
fire starter, whistle, and signaling mirror.

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:24.460
Make sure everyone feels your presence with
Mybell, the first customizable digital horn

00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:29.640
and light for bikes. Each one can hold two
digital sound files chosen by the user and

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:32.190
pre-selected LED lighting patterns.

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:37.160
Then make a rainbow with some sunlight and
crystals using this standing rainbow maker

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:42.280
and create 3D drawings with Creopop. Unlike
other 3D pens, this is the world's first to

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:48.400
use cool ink or photopolymers and doesn't
contain any heated parts or melting plastic.

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:53.020
The inks come in a variety of colors, elasticity,
and some are even magnetic.

00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:58.160
Now for those of age - go aerate some wine
with a bendy straw while you sort out your

00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:05.160
emotions by stuffing them into a Kimochi Emotion
doll and as always thanks for watching.
