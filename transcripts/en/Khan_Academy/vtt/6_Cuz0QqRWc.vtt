00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:02.070
- [Instructor] What we are
going to do in this video

00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:05.280
is talk about the idea of power

00:00:05.280 --> 00:00:08.230
when we are dealing
with significance tests.

00:00:08.230 --> 00:00:10.960
And power is an idea
that you might encounter

00:00:10.960 --> 00:00:13.950
in a first year statistics course.

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:16.610
It's turns out that it's
fairly difficult to calculate,

00:00:16.610 --> 00:00:19.240
but it's interesting to know what it means

00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:21.790
and what are the levers that
might increase the power

00:00:21.790 --> 00:00:24.920
or decrease the power
in a significance test.

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:28.860
So just to cut to the chase,
power is a probability.

00:00:28.860 --> 00:00:30.961
You can view it as the probability

00:00:30.961 --> 00:00:33.570
that you are doing the right thing

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:36.660
when the null hypothesis is not true,

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:39.580
and the right thing is you
should reject the null hypothesis

00:00:39.580 --> 00:00:40.413
if it's not true.

00:00:40.413 --> 00:00:44.240
So it's a probability of rejecting,

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:47.190
rejecting your null hypothesis

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:50.860
given that the null hypothesis is false.

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:53.950
So we can view it as a
conditional probability like that.

00:00:53.950 --> 00:00:55.780
But there's other ways
to conceptualize it.

00:00:55.780 --> 00:00:58.570
We can connect it to Type II errors.

00:00:58.570 --> 00:01:01.270
For example, you could
say this is equal to

00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:06.021
one minus the probability
of not rejecting,

00:01:06.021 --> 00:01:09.086
one minus the probability
of not rejecting,

00:01:09.086 --> 00:01:13.360
not rejecting the null hypothesis

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:17.000
given that the null hypothesis is false.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.130
And this thing that I just described,

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:21.490
not rejecting the null hypothesis

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:23.970
given that the null hypothesis is false,

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:27.480
this is, that's the
definition of a Type II error.

00:01:30.292 --> 00:01:32.937
So you could view it
as just the probability

00:01:32.937 --> 00:01:34.750
of not making a Type II error,

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:37.320
or one minus the probability
of making a Type II error.

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:38.630
Hopefully that's not confusing.

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:40.270
So let me just write it the other way.

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:41.896
So you could say it's the probability

00:01:41.896 --> 00:01:46.790
of not making a Type II error.

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:57.150
So what are the things that
would actually drive power?

00:01:57.150 --> 00:01:59.370
And to help us conceptualize that,

00:01:59.370 --> 00:02:01.840
I'll draw two sampling distributions,

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:05.430
one, if we assume that the
null hypothesis is true,

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:08.900
and one where we assume that
the null hypothesis is false,

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:11.140
and the true population
parameter is something different

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:13.150
than the null hypothesis is saying.

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:17.991
So for example, let's say
that we have a null hypothesis

00:02:17.991 --> 00:02:22.150
that our population mean is
equal to, let's just call it,

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:27.150
mu one, and we have an
alternative hypothesis,

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:31.570
so H sub a, that says, "Hey, no.

00:02:31.570 --> 00:02:36.310
"The population mean is
not equal to mu one."

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:40.740
So if you assumed a world where
the null hypothesis is true,

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:41.960
so I'll do that in blue,

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:45.690
so if we assume the
null hypothesis is true,

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:47.920
what would be our sampling distribution?

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:50.098
Remember, what we do in significance tests

00:02:50.098 --> 00:02:53.640
is we have some form of a population.

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:54.850
Let me draw that.

00:02:54.850 --> 00:02:58.090
You have a population right over here.

00:02:58.090 --> 00:03:02.010
And our hypotheses are
making some statement about

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:04.110
a parameter in that population.

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:09.110
And to test it, we take a
sample of a certain size.

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:11.990
We calculate a statistic, in this case,

00:03:11.990 --> 00:03:14.120
it would be the sample mean,

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:18.300
and we say if we assume that
our null hypothesis is true,

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:21.670
what is the probability of
getting that sample statistic?

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:23.290
And if that's below a threshold,

00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:24.630
which we call a significance level,

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:26.676
we reject the null hypothesis.

00:03:26.676 --> 00:03:29.910
And so that world that
we have been living in,

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:30.880
one way to think about it.

00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:33.910
In a world where you assume
the null hypothesis is true,

00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:36.620
you might have a sampling distribution

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:38.470
that looks something like this.

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:40.780
If the null hypothesis is true,

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:42.900
then the center of your
sampling distribution

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:45.790
would be right over here at mu one,

00:03:45.790 --> 00:03:48.494
and given your sample size,

00:03:48.494 --> 00:03:51.670
you would get a certain
sampling distribution

00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:53.380
for the sample means.

00:03:53.380 --> 00:03:56.080
If your sample size increases,
this will be narrower.

00:03:56.080 --> 00:03:59.980
If it decreases, this
thing is going to be wider.

00:03:59.980 --> 00:04:03.790
And you set a significance
level, which is essentially

00:04:03.790 --> 00:04:07.448
your probability of
rejecting the null hypothesis

00:04:07.448 --> 00:04:09.175
even if it is true.

00:04:09.175 --> 00:04:11.720
You could even view it as,
and we've talked about it,

00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:13.330
you can view your significance level

00:04:13.330 --> 00:04:16.400
as the probability of
making a Type I error.

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:19.052
So your significance level is some area.

00:04:19.052 --> 00:04:22.390
And so let's say it's
this area that I'm shading

00:04:22.390 --> 00:04:23.920
in orange right over here.

00:04:23.920 --> 00:04:25.930
That would be your significance level.

00:04:25.930 --> 00:04:28.750
So if you took a sample right over here

00:04:28.750 --> 00:04:30.720
and you calculated its sample mean

00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:34.090
and you happened to fall
in this area, this area,

00:04:34.090 --> 00:04:36.680
or this area right over
here, then you would

00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:39.072
reject your null hypothesis.

00:04:39.072 --> 00:04:42.800
Now if the null hypothesis
actually was true,

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:44.970
you would be committing a Type I error

00:04:44.970 --> 00:04:46.700
without knowing about it.

00:04:46.700 --> 00:04:50.021
But for power, we are
concerned with a Type II error.

00:04:50.021 --> 00:04:52.670
So in this one, it's a
conditional probability

00:04:52.670 --> 00:04:54.910
that our null hypothesis is false.

00:04:54.910 --> 00:04:57.950
And so let's construct
another sampling distribution

00:04:57.950 --> 00:05:00.620
in the case where our
null hypothesis is false.

00:05:00.620 --> 00:05:03.870
So let me just continue
this line right over here,

00:05:03.870 --> 00:05:05.340
and I'll do that.

00:05:05.340 --> 00:05:09.236
So let's imagine a world where
our null hypothesis is false

00:05:09.236 --> 00:05:14.236
and it's actually the case
that our mean is mu two,

00:05:15.270 --> 00:05:18.520
and let's say that mu
two is right over here,

00:05:18.520 --> 00:05:21.916
and in this reality, our
sampling distribution

00:05:21.916 --> 00:05:25.197
might look something like this.

00:05:25.197 --> 00:05:28.250
Once again, it will be
for a given sample size.

00:05:28.250 --> 00:05:29.550
The larger the sample size,

00:05:29.550 --> 00:05:32.850
the narrower this bell curve would be.

00:05:32.850 --> 00:05:36.530
And so it might look something like this.

00:05:36.530 --> 00:05:39.200
So in which situation, so in this world,

00:05:39.200 --> 00:05:42.294
we should be rejecting
the null hypothesis.

00:05:42.294 --> 00:05:46.530
But what are the samples in
which case we are not rejecting

00:05:46.530 --> 00:05:48.615
the null hypothesis even though we should?

00:05:48.615 --> 00:05:51.743
Well, we're not going to
reject the null hypothesis

00:05:51.743 --> 00:05:56.743
if we get samples in,
if we get a sample here,

00:05:57.220 --> 00:06:00.300
or a sample here, or a sample here,

00:06:00.300 --> 00:06:02.990
a sample, where if you
assume the null hypothesis

00:06:02.990 --> 00:06:06.490
is true, the probability
isn't that unlikely.

00:06:06.490 --> 00:06:10.570
And so the probability
of making a Type II error

00:06:10.570 --> 00:06:13.780
when we should reject the
null hypothesis but we don't

00:06:13.780 --> 00:06:18.150
is actually this area right over here.

00:06:18.150 --> 00:06:20.630
And the power, the
probability of rejecting

00:06:20.630 --> 00:06:23.000
the null hypothesis given that it's false,

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:25.690
so given that it's false would
be this red distribution,

00:06:25.690 --> 00:06:29.997
that would be the rest of
this area right over here.

00:06:29.997 --> 00:06:32.584
So how can we increase the power?

00:06:32.584 --> 00:06:35.700
Well, one way is to increase our alpha,

00:06:35.700 --> 00:06:37.490
increase our significance level.

00:06:37.490 --> 00:06:40.151
If we increase our significance
level, say from that,

00:06:40.151 --> 00:06:42.020
well, the significance level is an area.

00:06:42.020 --> 00:06:45.240
So if we want it to go up,
if we increase the area,

00:06:45.240 --> 00:06:46.990
and it looks something like that,

00:06:48.210 --> 00:06:51.240
now by expanding that significance area,

00:06:51.240 --> 00:06:54.890
we have increased the power
because now this yellow area

00:06:54.890 --> 00:06:56.100
is larger.

00:06:56.100 --> 00:06:59.140
We've pushed this boundary
to the left of it.

00:06:59.140 --> 00:07:00.690
Now you might say, "Oh, well, hey.

00:07:00.690 --> 00:07:01.950
"If we want to increase the power,

00:07:01.950 --> 00:07:03.710
"power sounds like a good thing,

00:07:03.710 --> 00:07:06.190
"why don't we just always increase alpha?"

00:07:06.190 --> 00:07:09.330
Well, the problem with that
is if you increase alpha,

00:07:09.330 --> 00:07:12.770
so let me write this down,
so if you take alpha,

00:07:12.770 --> 00:07:14.730
your significance level,
and you increase it,

00:07:14.730 --> 00:07:16.534
that will increase the power.

00:07:16.534 --> 00:07:18.675
That will increase the power,

00:07:18.675 --> 00:07:21.802
but it's also going to
increase your probability

00:07:21.802 --> 00:07:26.802
of a Type I error, because remember,

00:07:26.980 --> 00:07:30.750
that's one way to
conceptualize what alpha is,

00:07:30.750 --> 00:07:32.120
what your significance level is.

00:07:32.120 --> 00:07:35.080
It's a probability of a Type I error.

00:07:35.080 --> 00:07:37.920
Now what are other ways
to increase your power?

00:07:37.920 --> 00:07:40.290
Well, if you increase your sample size,

00:07:40.290 --> 00:07:42.640
then both of these distributions will,

00:07:42.640 --> 00:07:45.900
these sampling distributions
are going to get narrower.

00:07:45.900 --> 00:07:47.692
And so if these sampling distributions,

00:07:47.692 --> 00:07:52.182
if both of these sampling
distributions get narrower,

00:07:52.182 --> 00:07:57.154
then that situation where
you are not rejecting

00:07:57.154 --> 00:08:01.160
your null hypothesis
even though you should

00:08:01.160 --> 00:08:03.870
is going to have a lot less area.

00:08:03.870 --> 00:08:05.100
There's gonna be, one
way to think about it,

00:08:05.100 --> 00:08:07.040
there's going to be a lot less overlap

00:08:07.040 --> 00:08:09.710
between these two sampling distributions.

00:08:09.710 --> 00:08:11.320
And so let me write that down.

00:08:11.320 --> 00:08:16.240
So another way is to, if you
increase n, your sample size,

00:08:16.240 --> 00:08:19.290
that's going to increase your power.

00:08:19.290 --> 00:08:22.490
And this in general is always a good thing

00:08:22.490 --> 00:08:23.580
if you can do it.

00:08:23.580 --> 00:08:26.115
Now other things that may or
may not be under your control

00:08:26.115 --> 00:08:29.796
is well, the less variability
there is in the dataset,

00:08:29.796 --> 00:08:33.420
that would also make the
sampling distributions narrower,

00:08:33.420 --> 00:08:36.200
and that would also increase the power.

00:08:36.200 --> 00:08:39.480
So less variability and
you could measure that

00:08:39.480 --> 00:08:42.590
as by variance or standard deviation

00:08:42.590 --> 00:08:47.165
of your underlying dataset,
that would increase your power.

00:08:47.165 --> 00:08:50.590
Another thing that
would increase the power

00:08:50.590 --> 00:08:54.699
is if the true parameter is further away

00:08:54.699 --> 00:08:57.920
than what the null hypothesis is saying.

00:08:57.920 --> 00:09:00.700
So if you say true parameter,

00:09:02.490 --> 00:09:07.490
far from null hypothesis what it's saying,

00:09:07.710 --> 00:09:10.310
that also will increase the power.

00:09:10.310 --> 00:09:13.960
So these two are not
typically under your control

00:09:13.960 --> 00:09:17.640
but the sample size is and
the significance level is.

00:09:17.640 --> 00:09:19.720
Significance level,
there's a trade-off though.

00:09:19.720 --> 00:09:21.870
If you increase the power through that,

00:09:21.870 --> 00:09:24.309
you're also increasing the
probability of a Type I error.

00:09:24.309 --> 00:09:26.380
So for a lot of
researchers, they might say,

00:09:26.380 --> 00:09:29.230
"Hey, if a Type II error is worse,

00:09:29.230 --> 00:09:30.720
"I'm willing to make this trade-off.

00:09:30.720 --> 00:09:32.640
"I'll increase the significance level.

00:09:32.640 --> 00:09:36.020
"But if a Type I error is
actually what I'm afraid of,

00:09:36.020 --> 00:09:38.010
"then I wouldn't want top use this lever."

00:09:38.010 --> 00:09:40.731
But in any case, increasing
your sample size,

00:09:40.731 --> 00:09:43.780
if you can do it, is
going to be a good thing.
