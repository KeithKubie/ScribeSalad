00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.330
IRFAN DAMA: Good afternoon
ladies and gentlemen.

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:08.080
As we say in India, [HINDI],
brothers and sisters.

00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:11.020
It's so good to be here
with such a good turnout.

00:00:11.020 --> 00:00:11.760
That's excellent.

00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:13.130
My name is Irfan.

00:00:13.130 --> 00:00:16.490
I am the chef at Baadal,
the Indian restaurant

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:18.080
at the far end of Crittenden.

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:23.190
The one that everyone complains
about because it is so far.

00:00:23.190 --> 00:00:26.420
It takes a long bike
ride to get there.

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:30.180
I'm the chef of the
first Indian restaurants.

00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:33.150
I cook Indian food as
a fashion and today

00:00:33.150 --> 00:00:36.920
is extremely exciting day
for me because today it

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:39.480
seems like the
teacher has come home.

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:41.590
And when the teacher
comes to your doorstep,

00:00:41.590 --> 00:00:43.140
it is a day you are ecstatic.

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:47.890
And I'm really, really pleased
to present today's guest.

00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:50.310
He was born in Amritsar.

00:00:50.310 --> 00:00:52.790
He is a Michelin starred guest.

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:55.950
He is a filmmaker,
a humanitarian,

00:00:55.950 --> 00:00:58.670
and the host of "Master
Chef India," which

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:02.070
is a show that's based
on "Master Chef UK."

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:05.000
He has studied in
prestigious institutes

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.700
in India, including the Welcome
Groups School of Hotels,

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:10.694
has worked at the Taj group,
the Oberoi, the Leela group.

00:01:10.694 --> 00:01:12.110
For those are not
from India, this

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:15.460
is probably strange to you, but
for us who grew up in India,

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:18.210
these were institutions
to be associated with

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:20.330
and he has been in all of them.

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:23.140
He's also studied at the
Culinary Institute of America,

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:29.420
Cornell University, the New York
University, and Le Cordon Bleu.

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:32.330
He's no stranger
to the television.

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:35.700
He was a consultant chef
on Gordon Ramsay's TV

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:37.360
show "Kitchen Nightmares."

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:40.350
He appeared as a judge and
Indian Cuisine Specialist

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:43.900
on the two part season
finale of "Hell's Kitchen."

00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:48.474
He appeared on "Throwdown
with Bobby Flay" as a judge.

00:01:48.474 --> 00:01:50.390
But if he actually threw
down with Bobby Flay,

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:52.880
I'm sure he would have won.

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:57.450
And he's also been on the India
show the Martha Stewart's show

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:00.340
telecast on March, 2011.

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:03.600
He's hosted the
"Master Chef India"--

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:05.799
two seasons, I believe,
the second season.

00:02:05.799 --> 00:02:06.340
Four seasons.

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:08.169
I'm a little behind.

00:02:08.169 --> 00:02:14.710
He has authored-- says 13 books,
but I think it's more now.

00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:16.600
But "Spice Story
of India," "More

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:19.300
than Indian Cooking,"
"Flavors First," and now

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:20.850
"Return to Rivers."

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:23.840
I am so proud to present
Mr. Vikas Khanna.

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:32.090
Welcome, Vikas.

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:34.560
Please take a seat.

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:38.040
We're going to sit together
like we like each other.

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:40.480
So, Vikas, how have you been?

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:43.430
How have given it in
the Bay Area so far?

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:44.930
Tell us about your
first impression.

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:48.060
VIKAS KHANNA: I'm
a total New Yorker.

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:56.590
No drivers license, no patience,
but everything but the biz.

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:04.940
Because from my hometown I
landed straight in Manhattan.

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:07.810
It's like those movies you've
watched and they got freedom

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:10.160
and they came to America.

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:12.010
It could be after
World War II, but I

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:17.640
think I was fighting a war
with myself to come to U.S.

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:20.300
But, besides that,
it's fantastic.

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:25.010
It doesn't stop snowing
when you're in New York.

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:27.780
We love the pictures, but to
be in the real the pictures,

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:29.070
it's horrible.

00:03:29.070 --> 00:03:30.830
and I love the sun here.

00:03:30.830 --> 00:03:35.550
And it's thanks to Andrea,
who got me to the West Coast.

00:03:35.550 --> 00:03:37.800
And it was on my agenda.

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:40.530
I live in California
for some time.

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:43.590
But it's a great place
because I have so much respect

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:47.950
for all of you because you
all have driver's licenses

00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:51.040
and you drive so well.

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:54.750
I can only drive in
my hometown in Amitsar

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:58.360
because I know all the
cops and nobody stops me.

00:03:58.360 --> 00:03:59.360
And you can go anywhere.

00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:01.260
And It's total freedom, I think.

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:05.140
But besides that
I'm so proud to be--

00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:08.790
you're actually the first
few people in America

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:13.550
who are seeing this
book and it's something

00:04:13.550 --> 00:04:16.310
about-- there's something
very strange about holding

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:16.810
your book.

00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:21.170
Because you see the rough
drafts and you do the sketching.

00:04:21.170 --> 00:04:24.224
I wrote this whole book in
Punjabi, my native language,

00:04:24.224 --> 00:04:25.640
and then we couldn't
find anywhere

00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:27.540
to translate that to English.

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:37.250
I call this book as as
symbol of rebirth for me.

00:04:37.250 --> 00:04:39.650
I don't know if I can
ever do this book again.

00:04:39.650 --> 00:04:41.170
It's very scary.

00:04:41.170 --> 00:04:43.750
Because I remember one
interview I read as a child

00:04:43.750 --> 00:04:45.510
for Tanzig-- the
guy who climbed Mt.

00:04:45.510 --> 00:04:46.010
Everest.

00:04:46.010 --> 00:04:47.620
What was that?

00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:48.460
Tenzig.

00:04:48.460 --> 00:04:51.920
In Punjabi we call him Tanzig.

00:04:51.920 --> 00:04:53.760
So he climbed Mount Everest.

00:04:53.760 --> 00:04:56.970
And when he came down
on the ground base,

00:04:56.970 --> 00:04:58.720
he was asked, how do you feel.

00:04:58.720 --> 00:05:01.190
He said, I feel very sad.

00:05:01.190 --> 00:05:02.200
He said, why.

00:05:02.200 --> 00:05:06.900
He said, because I will never
find another Everest to climb.

00:05:06.900 --> 00:05:09.420
This was the highest peak.

00:05:09.420 --> 00:05:11.520
So, in this book I was
holding it first time

00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:13.890
when it came to me.

00:05:13.890 --> 00:05:16.870
I felt I've touched my
Mount Everest, because it

00:05:16.870 --> 00:05:20.090
was about-- I challenged
myself so much in this book.

00:05:20.090 --> 00:05:23.590
I wrote this book when I
was totally unemployed.

00:05:23.590 --> 00:05:27.380
I have no shame saying
this in America.

00:05:27.380 --> 00:05:32.250
I had just closed my third
restaurant and I was on my way

00:05:32.250 --> 00:05:34.480
to nowhere.

00:05:34.480 --> 00:05:37.870
And here I'm locking the
door of my restaurant

00:05:37.870 --> 00:05:40.180
and a call comes from
my friend Tashi saying

00:05:40.180 --> 00:05:43.170
that His Holiness, the
Dalai Lama, is in town.

00:05:43.170 --> 00:05:44.710
Would you like to meet him?

00:05:44.710 --> 00:05:47.970
And my question was why.

00:05:47.970 --> 00:05:51.300
I'm just doing a walk
of shame for my life

00:05:51.300 --> 00:05:56.040
and this was 2005 end.

00:05:56.040 --> 00:05:58.466
So, these things
are not in the book.

00:05:58.466 --> 00:06:00.840
So, it's important when I'm
doing something like the book

00:06:00.840 --> 00:06:03.690
I tell the something which is
totally true story about what

00:06:03.690 --> 00:06:08.680
is behind the glamour
and the real project.

00:06:08.680 --> 00:06:11.300
I had no reason to
go to His Holiness,

00:06:11.300 --> 00:06:13.610
but I still went there.

00:06:13.610 --> 00:06:15.990
I went to Beacon
Theater-- Beacon

00:06:15.990 --> 00:06:18.240
Theater it's called
on 73rd Street?

00:06:18.240 --> 00:06:20.540
Beacon Theater, and there
were probably 3,000 people.

00:06:20.540 --> 00:06:22.750
And wen His Holiness
comes he has

00:06:22.750 --> 00:06:25.922
a more impact than President
Obama comes to New York City.

00:06:25.922 --> 00:06:28.130
When the president comes
and the streets are blocked,

00:06:28.130 --> 00:06:29.718
we all criticize him.

00:06:29.718 --> 00:06:31.510
Go back to Washington!

00:06:31.510 --> 00:06:33.880
But we never say
that to His Holiness.

00:06:33.880 --> 00:06:37.990
And something about that
sacred power of his leadership,

00:06:37.990 --> 00:06:40.870
the way he leads us.

00:06:40.870 --> 00:06:42.920
I go and meet him.

00:06:42.920 --> 00:06:45.310
I still have to pay so
many bills that day.

00:06:45.310 --> 00:06:46.489
I didn't care.

00:06:46.489 --> 00:06:47.530
I just wanted to see him.

00:06:47.530 --> 00:06:48.940
I don't know why.

00:06:48.940 --> 00:06:52.150
So, eventually I went
there big face of shame

00:06:52.150 --> 00:06:55.430
and everybody asks, oh,
another restaurant closed.

00:06:55.430 --> 00:06:57.620
[LAUGHS] You will never
learn how to cook.

00:06:57.620 --> 00:06:59.260
I'm like, OK.

00:06:59.260 --> 00:07:01.080
And this is the first
person I met right

00:07:01.080 --> 00:07:01.996
at the Beacon Theater.

00:07:01.996 --> 00:07:04.031
I said, I don't
know why it closed.

00:07:04.031 --> 00:07:05.280
It was a big building lawsuit.

00:07:05.280 --> 00:07:06.500
Oh, everybody says that.

00:07:06.500 --> 00:07:08.062
We have a lease problem.

00:07:08.062 --> 00:07:09.240
[LAUGHS]

00:07:09.240 --> 00:07:13.360
So I very quietly, humbly
stood last in the line.

00:07:13.360 --> 00:07:16.536
And His Holiness
starts walking--

00:07:16.536 --> 00:07:18.320
and this is something
which is very

00:07:18.320 --> 00:07:19.896
surreal-- it's called surreal.

00:07:19.896 --> 00:07:23.010
A double R, I think.

00:07:23.010 --> 00:07:25.420
So, I'm walking-- I'm
in the last of the line

00:07:25.420 --> 00:07:27.160
and His Holiness comes.

00:07:27.160 --> 00:07:29.140
And I don't know what happened.

00:07:29.140 --> 00:07:33.970
He's a short man
with a huge presence.

00:07:33.970 --> 00:07:36.720
Just humbly bows
and keeps walking.

00:07:36.720 --> 00:07:39.710
And he comes and touches
my forehead, like this,

00:07:39.710 --> 00:07:41.340
and touches his heart.

00:07:41.340 --> 00:07:44.270
And he ha beautiful silk cloth.

00:07:44.270 --> 00:07:46.730
Just hands it over to me.

00:07:46.730 --> 00:07:49.680
And just goes away as
if nothing happened.

00:07:49.680 --> 00:07:52.750
So there's another American
girl standing behind me.

00:07:52.750 --> 00:07:56.580
She just pushes me
and says, F-you.

00:07:56.580 --> 00:07:57.990
And I'm like, what did I do.

00:07:57.990 --> 00:07:59.970
She's saying, oh, you
have Bollywood affect.

00:07:59.970 --> 00:08:02.050
I said, I didn't do anything.

00:08:02.050 --> 00:08:04.370
I'm like, I didn't even
know what happen to me.

00:08:04.370 --> 00:08:05.760
She was so angry at me.

00:08:05.760 --> 00:08:07.810
Why didn't it happen to her.

00:08:07.810 --> 00:08:10.960
I'm like, I'm sorry,
what happened actually?

00:08:10.960 --> 00:08:13.030
So, I didn't know what happened.

00:08:13.030 --> 00:08:15.830
But I went to the lecture,
which I was not going to attend.

00:08:15.830 --> 00:08:20.620
I just went as a promise
to my friend Tashi.

00:08:20.620 --> 00:08:23.300
And I go and sit in the
lecture and His Holiness

00:08:23.300 --> 00:08:24.850
sits there so quietly.

00:08:24.850 --> 00:08:27.292
And I remember he was
sneezing that day.

00:08:27.292 --> 00:08:28.750
And he had this
small handkerchief,

00:08:28.750 --> 00:08:32.460
which he would put back
in the clothes he wears.

00:08:32.460 --> 00:08:34.639
And he would sneeze like this.

00:08:34.639 --> 00:08:36.880
And it was so real.

00:08:36.880 --> 00:08:39.530
He's a symbol of something so
high and even he has a cold.

00:08:39.530 --> 00:08:41.429
I'm just thinking about that.

00:08:41.429 --> 00:08:43.280
And then he talks about that.

00:08:43.280 --> 00:08:46.250
You think there's nothing
has end ever in life.

00:08:46.250 --> 00:08:49.720
It's always changing
of form and structure.

00:08:49.720 --> 00:08:52.100
I think people who
think it's the end,

00:08:52.100 --> 00:08:56.170
they're not seeing beyond
what they can achieve.

00:08:56.170 --> 00:09:00.570
And I was that one person who
thought it was the end for me.

00:09:00.570 --> 00:09:01.916
I go back home in the night.

00:09:01.916 --> 00:09:04.040
I called my mom early in
the morning and said, Mom,

00:09:04.040 --> 00:09:05.290
I met His Holiness Dalai Lama.

00:09:05.290 --> 00:09:06.930
And she says, OK.

00:09:06.930 --> 00:09:09.741
I said I'm going to
finish my project.

00:09:09.741 --> 00:09:10.740
She said, which project?

00:09:10.740 --> 00:09:14.062
I said, "Return to the Rivers."

00:09:14.062 --> 00:09:15.020
She said, what is that?

00:09:15.020 --> 00:09:17.228
I said, Mom, that's-- this
is a conversation you have

00:09:17.228 --> 00:09:19.024
in your native language.

00:09:19.024 --> 00:09:19.940
She said, what's that?

00:09:19.940 --> 00:09:22.290
I said, it's my book on
Himal-- She's like, oh, no, no,

00:09:22.290 --> 00:09:23.331
don't write another book.

00:09:23.331 --> 00:09:24.390
Nobody buys your books.

00:09:24.390 --> 00:09:28.140
I was like, Oh
mom, that helps me.

00:09:28.140 --> 00:09:30.090
She says, remember last
time you wrote a book

00:09:30.090 --> 00:09:31.540
and you said you
sold two copies.

00:09:31.540 --> 00:09:36.580
I said, yeah, but I bought one,
so I just sold one actually.

00:09:36.580 --> 00:09:40.295
She's like, why are you
writing another book?

00:09:40.295 --> 00:09:42.795
She's like, isn't that enough
that your restaurant is closed

00:09:42.795 --> 00:09:43.836
and you don't have a job.

00:09:43.836 --> 00:09:46.670
And I said, Mom,
it's not enough.

00:09:46.670 --> 00:09:47.890
It's just not enough.

00:09:47.890 --> 00:09:49.440
So she said, where
do you want to go?

00:09:49.440 --> 00:09:50.731
I said, I want to go to Bhutan.

00:09:50.731 --> 00:09:52.520
And she said, where's that?

00:09:52.520 --> 00:09:55.440
I said it's up in the mountains
somewhere in the Himalayas.

00:09:55.440 --> 00:10:00.590
So she booked me a ticket
from New York to Bhutan.

00:10:00.590 --> 00:10:04.130
And that is when the real
journey started for this book.

00:10:04.130 --> 00:10:07.770
I go to Bhutan-- if you
guys know about Bhutan

00:10:07.770 --> 00:10:10.424
you must Google-- they
don't have per capita income

00:10:10.424 --> 00:10:11.340
or anything like that.

00:10:11.340 --> 00:10:13.465
They have per happiness
income, that kind of thing.

00:10:13.465 --> 00:10:15.190
I don't know what they call it.

00:10:15.190 --> 00:10:19.370
It's something which is
closest to living in paradise.

00:10:19.370 --> 00:10:22.977
That place just sucked me in.

00:10:22.977 --> 00:10:25.060
I landed, and you have to
land through the valley,

00:10:25.060 --> 00:10:25.670
the mountains.

00:10:25.670 --> 00:10:27.510
The plane goes like this.

00:10:27.510 --> 00:10:29.350
And then the aircraft lands.

00:10:29.350 --> 00:10:31.880
It's a palace.

00:10:31.880 --> 00:10:33.410
Nobody disturbed nature.

00:10:33.410 --> 00:10:34.390
Nothing.

00:10:34.390 --> 00:10:36.640
There were stories about
that place which I will never

00:10:36.640 --> 00:10:38.650
be able to forget
ever in my life.

00:10:38.650 --> 00:10:41.270
So I was totally in
love with that place.

00:10:41.270 --> 00:10:43.560
I said this is fantastic
to begin writing

00:10:43.560 --> 00:10:45.530
and rediscovered yourself.

00:10:45.530 --> 00:10:49.582
All of the lessons what were
in the book started from there.

00:10:49.582 --> 00:10:51.040
When I finished
there-- I was there

00:10:51.040 --> 00:10:52.164
for almost 2 and 1/2 weeks.

00:10:52.164 --> 00:10:52.940
I called my mom.

00:10:52.940 --> 00:10:54.100
Can you book me to Tibet?

00:10:54.100 --> 00:10:54.740
And she said, where is that.

00:10:54.740 --> 00:10:57.050
It's like, come on, ma,
don't ask me these questions.

00:10:57.050 --> 00:11:00.630
Just call the agent and book me
a ticket from-- and she said,

00:11:00.630 --> 00:11:02.280
oh, this is a very
expensive ticket.

00:11:02.280 --> 00:11:03.357
I said, OK.

00:11:03.357 --> 00:11:04.940
So I said, then I'm
going to Katmandu.

00:11:07.720 --> 00:11:09.850
I don't come from
very huge background.

00:11:09.850 --> 00:11:12.050
I figured out, OK,
I'm going to take

00:11:12.050 --> 00:11:15.760
a bus from Paro to Katmandu.

00:11:15.760 --> 00:11:18.515
It took me three
days, but that was OK.

00:11:18.515 --> 00:11:20.890
And not that anything was
happening in my life that time;

00:11:20.890 --> 00:11:23.960
it's like nobody needed
me at that point.

00:11:23.960 --> 00:11:26.540
And I started traveling by bus.

00:11:26.540 --> 00:11:28.710
And I figured out that
the most beautiful stories

00:11:28.710 --> 00:11:31.240
happen when you're
not in your comfort

00:11:31.240 --> 00:11:35.120
zone, when you're being awake.

00:11:35.120 --> 00:11:36.470
There's an American philosopher.

00:11:36.470 --> 00:11:38.886
I can't pronounce his name,
so I don't want to insult him.

00:11:38.886 --> 00:11:41.800
So He said that when you
look back in your life,

00:11:41.800 --> 00:11:43.990
your life will not be
defined about the nights you

00:11:43.990 --> 00:11:45.050
slept so well.

00:11:45.050 --> 00:11:47.770
They'll be defined by
those sleepless nights.

00:11:47.770 --> 00:11:51.176
I can spell his name, but
it was a difficult name.

00:11:51.176 --> 00:11:53.600
But I like that,
because all these nights

00:11:53.600 --> 00:11:57.620
I was up and thinking what do
I want to do with this book?

00:11:57.620 --> 00:12:01.080
The whole project was
about 2,600 pages.

00:12:01.080 --> 00:12:03.850
And I finished it in
almost five years.

00:12:03.850 --> 00:12:08.010
That time, Junoon was being
born at one time of my life.

00:12:08.010 --> 00:12:11.790
In 1990, I read one
article that India

00:12:11.790 --> 00:12:14.560
is one of the fastest growing
countries in population.

00:12:14.560 --> 00:12:18.170
But it's a shame, we will
never get a Michelin star.

00:12:18.170 --> 00:12:20.330
And I said, what
is a Michelin star?

00:12:20.330 --> 00:12:22.580
There was no Google-- sorry,
I'm in a Google office.

00:12:22.580 --> 00:12:23.824
[LAUGHTER]

00:12:23.824 --> 00:12:25.740
VIKAS KHANNA: So you
couldn't Google anything.

00:12:25.740 --> 00:12:27.830
So you don't know what
Michelin star was.

00:12:27.830 --> 00:12:29.290
But you don't have
much reference

00:12:29.290 --> 00:12:31.050
of books at that point.

00:12:31.050 --> 00:12:33.840
You know, every time you
read some of my books,

00:12:33.840 --> 00:12:36.340
I'll saw we grew up
in a pre-Google age,

00:12:36.340 --> 00:12:39.270
where had one newspaper
coming to my hometown.

00:12:39.270 --> 00:12:41.650
And there was no
information besides that.

00:12:41.650 --> 00:12:45.150
So here you're writing about
such a foreign culture, which

00:12:45.150 --> 00:12:48.830
is in between China and India.

00:12:48.830 --> 00:12:50.610
And there are so many
beautiful countries

00:12:50.610 --> 00:12:53.200
which are dominated by this
whole cultures of Tibet, Nepal,

00:12:53.200 --> 00:12:56.395
Bhutan, Burma, North
Pakistan, North India.

00:12:56.395 --> 00:13:01.580
I thought this was the
strip I must focus on.

00:13:01.580 --> 00:13:03.120
And this is what I continued.

00:13:03.120 --> 00:13:05.070
And that's why the book is born.

00:13:05.070 --> 00:13:07.570
IRFAN DAMA: What a fascinating
story, seriously fascinating.

00:13:07.570 --> 00:13:10.770
But what I love about it is
I love with what humility

00:13:10.770 --> 00:13:13.460
you talk about
failures in your life.

00:13:13.460 --> 00:13:16.420
You have mentioned of
one of the interviews

00:13:16.420 --> 00:13:18.880
that I was seeing that when
you first came to New York,

00:13:18.880 --> 00:13:21.660
you literally
started with nothing.

00:13:21.660 --> 00:13:23.200
You had $3 in your pocket.

00:13:23.200 --> 00:13:25.080
And you ended up at
a homeless shelter.

00:13:25.080 --> 00:13:25.610
VIKAS KHANNA: Christmas.

00:13:25.610 --> 00:13:27.485
IRFAN DAMA: And you
stayed there for a while.

00:13:27.485 --> 00:13:29.230
You got a blanket from someone.

00:13:29.230 --> 00:13:31.970
Tell us about the experience.

00:13:31.970 --> 00:13:33.600
You had a business
in India, correct?

00:13:33.600 --> 00:13:34.060
VIKAS KHANNA: Yes.

00:13:34.060 --> 00:13:35.809
IRFAN DAMA: And then
you came to New York.

00:13:35.809 --> 00:13:38.680
So my question is what
drew you to New York?

00:13:38.680 --> 00:13:42.330
And you were at a
point where-- it

00:13:42.330 --> 00:13:44.880
scares most of us
sitting in this room--

00:13:44.880 --> 00:13:48.280
to be ever at that situation,
to be in a homeless shelter.

00:13:48.280 --> 00:13:50.210
And you came out of that.

00:13:50.210 --> 00:13:52.080
So I'd love to know
about that experience.

00:13:52.080 --> 00:13:54.620
So it's a touching story.

00:13:54.620 --> 00:13:55.900
Please tell us about it.

00:13:55.900 --> 00:13:59.750
VIKAS KHANNA: I came to America
in December-- not in December.

00:13:59.750 --> 00:14:00.790
My [INAUDIBLE] hit me.

00:14:00.790 --> 00:14:02.466
It's on December.

00:14:02.466 --> 00:14:04.530
You don't live in calendars.

00:14:04.530 --> 00:14:08.780
This is how I had to-- I never
went to proper English schools,

00:14:08.780 --> 00:14:11.035
so I think it's my ability.

00:14:11.035 --> 00:14:12.410
It's not something
which I should

00:14:12.410 --> 00:14:14.800
feel I lack behind something.

00:14:14.800 --> 00:14:17.155
Because then I could
figure out my publisher,

00:14:17.155 --> 00:14:20.390
she always says that
grammar is not a language.

00:14:20.390 --> 00:14:22.790
There's only one language,
and that's the heart.

00:14:22.790 --> 00:14:24.160
So I don't worry about grammar.

00:14:24.160 --> 00:14:26.800
They'll figure out in a nonce.

00:14:26.800 --> 00:14:28.531
I came on December 2 to America.

00:14:30.950 --> 00:14:32.200
There's an author in American.

00:14:32.200 --> 00:14:35.550
His name is Richard Bach.

00:14:35.550 --> 00:14:37.300
Some of us must have
read this book called

00:14:37.300 --> 00:14:40.360
"Jonathan Livingston Seagull."

00:14:40.360 --> 00:14:42.050
That was the first
book I ever read

00:14:42.050 --> 00:14:44.350
by an American author--
my brother gave it

00:14:44.350 --> 00:14:50.730
to me-- in which Jonathan
wanted to fly higher.

00:14:50.730 --> 00:14:54.595
But where I come from, it was
a very homogeneous structure

00:14:54.595 --> 00:14:57.760
of life, where we
only ate a few dishes.

00:14:57.760 --> 00:15:00.380
And besides, that
was not our cuisine.

00:15:00.380 --> 00:15:01.890
And we will not accept it.

00:15:01.890 --> 00:15:04.219
You know, that happens.

00:15:04.219 --> 00:15:05.760
But I came to
America-- I don't know,

00:15:05.760 --> 00:15:07.280
I think Richard
Bach-- that book,

00:15:07.280 --> 00:15:10.030
really-- that 80-page
book was my Bible.

00:15:10.030 --> 00:15:12.060
And like a little child
who likes to repeat,

00:15:12.060 --> 00:15:14.432
I would keep repeating
reading that again and again.

00:15:14.432 --> 00:15:16.640
My brother would say that
maybe you don't understand.

00:15:16.640 --> 00:15:18.966
That's why you have to
read it so many times.

00:15:18.966 --> 00:15:22.090
I said, it's a very
difficult book, actually.

00:15:22.090 --> 00:15:26.750
But how did he figure out to
fly higher than everyone else?

00:15:26.750 --> 00:15:29.690
And I don't understand the
story of going back home.

00:15:29.690 --> 00:15:30.660
Why did he go back?

00:15:30.660 --> 00:15:32.743
And he wanted to teach
everybody to be independent

00:15:32.743 --> 00:15:37.400
and to be-- that whole concept
of American individualism.

00:15:37.400 --> 00:15:39.330
I was so moved by this.

00:15:39.330 --> 00:15:41.820
I said, no, we have
to live in groups,

00:15:41.820 --> 00:15:43.900
like in how we live back home.

00:15:43.900 --> 00:15:47.195
Everybody has to live
a kind of similar life.

00:15:47.195 --> 00:15:50.010
And everybody has to live
almost in that group.

00:15:50.010 --> 00:15:52.820
So Jonathan Livingston
Seagull will never be born,

00:15:52.820 --> 00:15:54.500
sometimes you feel.

00:15:54.500 --> 00:15:56.546
But I wanted to be
somebody who defines

00:15:56.546 --> 00:15:57.670
cooking in a different way.

00:15:57.670 --> 00:16:00.880
And that is may be one of
the biggest reasons why

00:16:00.880 --> 00:16:06.040
I wanted to be at the greatest
stage of cooking of Manhattan.

00:16:06.040 --> 00:16:09.360
I don't know, but
maybe that's what

00:16:09.360 --> 00:16:11.580
we call destiny,
which we can't define.

00:16:11.580 --> 00:16:12.490
But I came here.

00:16:12.490 --> 00:16:14.340
And I don't know
if you remember,

00:16:14.340 --> 00:16:17.320
if anybody has landed
in New York pre-9/11,

00:16:17.320 --> 00:16:21.250
it was a very different country.

00:16:21.250 --> 00:16:25.120
9/11 changed so much
of our priorities.

00:16:25.120 --> 00:16:26.630
It changed our mindsets.

00:16:26.630 --> 00:16:28.380
Even if you look at
the literature written

00:16:28.380 --> 00:16:32.280
by American authors before
9/11 and after 9/11,

00:16:32.280 --> 00:16:34.170
there's such a
strong subconscious

00:16:34.170 --> 00:16:36.400
shift which has happened.

00:16:36.400 --> 00:16:41.090
Because I was right there, when
everything started changing.

00:16:41.090 --> 00:16:46.490
I was standing right Salaam
Bombay restaurant, just almost

00:16:46.490 --> 00:16:49.990
like 1 and 1/2 blocks
away from the site.

00:16:49.990 --> 00:16:51.790
I saw that shift.

00:16:51.790 --> 00:16:54.100
And that is something
which has really

00:16:54.100 --> 00:16:57.310
got me so moved about
the understanding

00:16:57.310 --> 00:17:01.480
that this country
is forever evolving.

00:17:01.480 --> 00:17:03.340
It is something
which is the spirit

00:17:03.340 --> 00:17:08.030
is about-- it's so invincible,
that they reinvent themselves.

00:17:08.030 --> 00:17:10.160
And that was something
so important for me.

00:17:10.160 --> 00:17:16.000
But before that, I remember
that subway used to cost $1.50.

00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:19.357
And I go to a restaurant--
I don't have a cell phone.

00:17:19.357 --> 00:17:21.690
Initially, at that point, you
don't have prepaid phones.

00:17:21.690 --> 00:17:23.324
You only could get a phone
with a Social Security.

00:17:23.324 --> 00:17:24.450
IRFAN DAMA: Right.

00:17:24.450 --> 00:17:26.283
VIKAS KHANNA: I never
had a social security,

00:17:26.283 --> 00:17:30.030
so like, you know, those
totally-- I can call myself,

00:17:30.030 --> 00:17:31.670
yeah, I was illegal
at that time.

00:17:31.670 --> 00:17:33.212
I have forgot what was legal.

00:17:33.212 --> 00:17:35.420
I said oh, I have a 10-years
visa to come to America.

00:17:35.420 --> 00:17:36.150
I'm not illegal.

00:17:36.150 --> 00:17:38.700
Sir, it was expired.

00:17:38.700 --> 00:17:39.500
IRFAN DAMA: Wow.

00:17:39.500 --> 00:17:40.280
VIKAS KHANNA: Your entry was.

00:17:40.280 --> 00:17:42.196
And I'm like I had no
idea about those things.

00:17:42.196 --> 00:17:44.190
I was just come here
to American to cook.

00:17:44.190 --> 00:17:46.231
I didn't have to worry
about all of these things.

00:17:46.231 --> 00:17:48.760
We never worried
about these things.

00:17:48.760 --> 00:17:50.820
So I didn't have money.

00:17:50.820 --> 00:17:51.720
But I only had $3.

00:17:51.720 --> 00:17:53.060
So I'm going to the restaurant.

00:17:53.060 --> 00:17:53.730
The restaurant is closed.

00:17:53.730 --> 00:17:54.521
Nobody informed me.

00:17:54.521 --> 00:17:55.550
Nobody called me.

00:17:55.550 --> 00:17:58.300
And on Christmas Day, the
restaurants are closed.

00:17:58.300 --> 00:18:02.610
So I'm walking up on
Broadway near Canal Street.

00:18:02.610 --> 00:18:04.590
And there's a line of people.

00:18:04.590 --> 00:18:06.580
And I'm standing in the line.

00:18:06.580 --> 00:18:11.375
And a lady comes, and she
hands over to me a blanket.

00:18:11.375 --> 00:18:15.812
This is 2000, December 25.

00:18:15.812 --> 00:18:17.300
And exactly what I needed.

00:18:17.300 --> 00:18:18.740
I needed a blanket that time.

00:18:18.740 --> 00:18:20.060
I was shivering.

00:18:20.060 --> 00:18:21.020
And my socks were wet.

00:18:21.020 --> 00:18:24.140
It had just stop raining.

00:18:24.140 --> 00:18:28.645
And she tells me,
Merry Christmas.

00:18:28.645 --> 00:18:29.770
I don't know what happened.

00:18:29.770 --> 00:18:30.520
I just hugged her.

00:18:30.520 --> 00:18:31.510
I said, thank you.

00:18:31.510 --> 00:18:33.980
I needed this.

00:18:33.980 --> 00:18:35.420
I said what is this line for?

00:18:35.420 --> 00:18:38.240
This is the homeless shelter,
New York Rescue Mission.

00:18:38.240 --> 00:18:40.690
And now I go to New
York Rescue Mission.

00:18:40.690 --> 00:18:43.660
I'm a part of there.

00:18:43.660 --> 00:18:46.460
I love everything about
what they stand for.

00:18:46.460 --> 00:18:48.840
I think at that
point, you need hope,

00:18:48.840 --> 00:18:51.060
more than you need shelter,
more than you need food,

00:18:51.060 --> 00:18:52.990
more than you need a blanket.

00:18:52.990 --> 00:18:56.040
You need a hope that
it's going to be OK.

00:18:56.040 --> 00:18:57.040
It's OK.

00:18:57.040 --> 00:18:59.210
God is also saying,
OK, I didn't create you

00:18:59.210 --> 00:19:04.370
as a very intelligent creature,
but I'm not repenting it,

00:19:04.370 --> 00:19:08.426
because I feel that you will
find your way back home.

00:19:08.426 --> 00:19:11.780
And one day, eventually,
you will find your destiny.

00:19:11.780 --> 00:19:14.250
All you have to do is
keep your head high.

00:19:14.250 --> 00:19:18.000
And I remember when they gave
me shelter to live there too.

00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:21.060
And I was so happy to save $3
that I don't have to eat out.

00:19:21.060 --> 00:19:23.900
I don't have to try
to take a subway.

00:19:23.900 --> 00:19:25.790
And you know, it's OK.

00:19:25.790 --> 00:19:28.610
In this country, you can talk
about reinventing and falling

00:19:28.610 --> 00:19:30.370
flat on the-- and
I like when Oprah

00:19:30.370 --> 00:19:33.670
said it's great to
fall on the ground.

00:19:33.670 --> 00:19:36.630
You see the world in a
total new perspective.

00:19:36.630 --> 00:19:38.690
It's absolutely true.

00:19:38.690 --> 00:19:41.252
And when you have
fallen to the point when

00:19:41.252 --> 00:19:43.460
you don't know if you'll
ever get a next meal or not,

00:19:43.460 --> 00:19:45.370
or you'll be thrown
out of your apartment,

00:19:45.370 --> 00:19:48.194
you have such a different
perspective of success

00:19:48.194 --> 00:19:48.860
when you get it.

00:19:48.860 --> 00:19:49.901
IRFAN DAMA: That is true.

00:19:49.901 --> 00:19:52.560
And they say it's not about
how many times you fall,

00:19:52.560 --> 00:19:55.790
it's how quickly you get
up that makes a difference.

00:19:55.790 --> 00:19:59.540
But what is really
impressive to see

00:19:59.540 --> 00:20:02.475
is you've gone through your
fair share of hardships.

00:20:02.475 --> 00:20:05.750
You just mentioned that you
had a third restaurant that

00:20:05.750 --> 00:20:06.620
closed down.

00:20:06.620 --> 00:20:13.045
And seeing where you are today,
it must have changed you.

00:20:13.045 --> 00:20:14.420
VIKAS KHANNA:
There was one thing

00:20:14.420 --> 00:20:16.090
which was very
stranger which always

00:20:16.090 --> 00:20:18.860
happened to me for a long time.

00:20:18.860 --> 00:20:20.330
I'll tell you a small incident.

00:20:20.330 --> 00:20:22.380
I used to live in Queens.

00:20:22.380 --> 00:20:26.260
And when everybody come, most of
the immigrants live in Queens.

00:20:26.260 --> 00:20:27.960
I mean, take Number 7.

00:20:27.960 --> 00:20:29.534
That's the best train even now.

00:20:29.534 --> 00:20:30.450
It's a favorite train.

00:20:30.450 --> 00:20:32.950
So I'm sitting next
to us a sardar-ji,

00:20:32.950 --> 00:20:36.750
like a Sikh guy, who's
elderly, like he must be 70s.

00:20:36.750 --> 00:20:40.450
So he's asking me, like,
son, what do you do?

00:20:40.450 --> 00:20:43.410
I said I make-- you
know, in my culture,

00:20:43.410 --> 00:20:45.560
we don't say I make food.

00:20:45.560 --> 00:20:46.500
We say [HINDI].

00:20:46.500 --> 00:20:51.370
It means "I make bread."

00:20:51.370 --> 00:20:53.540
It's such a complex
language, the whole concept

00:20:53.540 --> 00:20:55.260
of so many languages
in one country.

00:20:55.260 --> 00:20:57.240
So we never say "I cook food."

00:20:57.240 --> 00:20:59.540
You always say "I
cook bread" when

00:20:59.540 --> 00:21:00.970
you translate it in English.

00:21:00.970 --> 00:21:02.850
So I said [HINDI].

00:21:02.850 --> 00:21:04.200
He's saying, oh, don't worry.

00:21:04.200 --> 00:21:05.491
One day, you'll get a good job.

00:21:05.491 --> 00:21:06.440
I said, no!

00:21:06.440 --> 00:21:10.940
[LAUGHTER]

00:21:10.940 --> 00:21:14.340
VIKAS KHANNA: I said, but
that's all I know how to do.

00:21:14.340 --> 00:21:16.580
He's saying, why
don't you drive a cab.

00:21:16.580 --> 00:21:18.534
[LAUGHTER]

00:21:18.534 --> 00:21:20.700
VIKAS KHANNA: I said, I
don't have driver's license.

00:21:20.700 --> 00:21:22.230
He said oh, that's why you cook.

00:21:22.230 --> 00:21:23.586
I said--

00:21:23.586 --> 00:21:26.020
[LAUGHTER]

00:21:26.020 --> 00:21:28.580
VIKAS KHANNA: So he's
saying, oh, no, no.

00:21:28.580 --> 00:21:29.300
You are young.

00:21:29.300 --> 00:21:31.940
You know, you could do double
shifts in cab and everything.

00:21:31.940 --> 00:21:33.495
You can do good money.

00:21:33.495 --> 00:21:34.370
I'll put you through.

00:21:34.370 --> 00:21:35.494
You look like a decent guy.

00:21:35.494 --> 00:21:38.550
And I'm, like, but I
only know how to cook.

00:21:38.550 --> 00:21:41.090
He said, oh my god, you're
really dumb, he's telling me.

00:21:41.090 --> 00:21:42.590
[LAUGHTER]

00:21:42.590 --> 00:21:47.630
VIKAS KHANNA: And then he asked
me, so you have any future?

00:21:47.630 --> 00:21:50.100
I said, yeah, I've
been making food.

00:21:50.100 --> 00:21:53.802
He said, why, you don't need
any training to make food.

00:21:53.802 --> 00:21:55.760
And then he asked me this
very simple question,

00:21:55.760 --> 00:21:58.240
which has never left me.

00:21:58.240 --> 00:22:00.170
He saw that I was
not moving away

00:22:00.170 --> 00:22:02.812
from this concept of that
"I cook bread," literally.

00:22:02.812 --> 00:22:04.520
So he's saying, where
did you learn from?

00:22:04.520 --> 00:22:07.650
I said, I learned it from
my grandmother's kitchen.

00:22:10.570 --> 00:22:13.200
And also, I learned how to
roll a bread at the Golden

00:22:13.200 --> 00:22:17.360
Temple, which is like a big
temple in Amritsar, which

00:22:17.360 --> 00:22:20.740
is where I was raised.

00:22:20.740 --> 00:22:24.970
And he took my
hand and kissed it.

00:22:24.970 --> 00:22:28.520
He's saying-- prasaab-dha
means God's food.

00:22:28.520 --> 00:22:31.730
He's saying go and
serve God's food.

00:22:31.730 --> 00:22:34.884
He's saying, you
continue to do that.

00:22:34.884 --> 00:22:37.217
He's saying, you don't have
to drive a cab, don't worry.

00:22:37.217 --> 00:22:37.664
[LAUGHTER]

00:22:37.664 --> 00:22:38.330
IRFAN DAMA: Wow.

00:22:38.330 --> 00:22:40.840
It's interesting.

00:22:40.840 --> 00:22:43.220
I guess, hardships change
people in different ways.

00:22:43.220 --> 00:22:45.910
Some people, when
they get to success,

00:22:45.910 --> 00:22:48.070
they forget about
where they came from.

00:22:48.070 --> 00:22:50.190
But obviously, you haven't.

00:22:50.190 --> 00:22:53.590
You've set up a number of
humanitarian organizations,

00:22:53.590 --> 00:22:57.330
the big one being SAKIV
and Cooking for Life.

00:22:57.330 --> 00:22:59.710
So can you tell us something
about these humanitarian

00:22:59.710 --> 00:23:03.930
organizations that you have
created, and what's it about?

00:23:03.930 --> 00:23:05.600
VIKAS KHANNA: It was after 9/11.

00:23:05.600 --> 00:23:09.090
It struck a chord in your
heart in a different way.

00:23:09.090 --> 00:23:11.970
You figured out that one thing
which will always sustain us

00:23:11.970 --> 00:23:14.300
is togetherness.

00:23:14.300 --> 00:23:18.640
And I remember that
I was at the site.

00:23:18.640 --> 00:23:20.890
And people were a
little bit-- because I

00:23:20.890 --> 00:23:24.010
look so much like my "cousins."

00:23:24.010 --> 00:23:26.580
So some people were
getting worried about me,

00:23:26.580 --> 00:23:28.800
like what are you
doing on this site?

00:23:28.800 --> 00:23:32.370
And it was fear is a
very dangerous thing.

00:23:32.370 --> 00:23:33.250
It is not hatred.

00:23:33.250 --> 00:23:36.180
Hatred is a very
small part of fear.

00:23:36.180 --> 00:23:37.180
What are you doing here?

00:23:37.180 --> 00:23:39.525
And I'm, like, I want to help.

00:23:39.525 --> 00:23:41.400
So the restaurant was
right across the street

00:23:41.400 --> 00:23:42.840
from the site.

00:23:42.840 --> 00:23:45.540
So every single day--
initially nobody

00:23:45.540 --> 00:23:48.340
would come-- but every single
day, outside the restaurant

00:23:48.340 --> 00:23:51.150
Salaam Bombay, I'll put a
small buffet for all the people

00:23:51.150 --> 00:23:54.060
who are volunteering
at the site.

00:23:54.060 --> 00:23:57.680
I will make one
biriyani, one dhal,

00:23:57.680 --> 00:23:59.357
and I'll have some fresh breads.

00:23:59.357 --> 00:24:01.190
Because nobody was
coming to the restaurant.

00:24:01.190 --> 00:24:04.560
After that, that area just died.

00:24:04.560 --> 00:24:07.019
Tribeca started
crumbling, because nobody

00:24:07.019 --> 00:24:08.810
wanted to take it as
a tourist destination.

00:24:08.810 --> 00:24:10.867
You don't want to go--
and people would tell me

00:24:10.867 --> 00:24:12.200
we don't want to go out and eat.

00:24:12.200 --> 00:24:13.550
I would tell my
friends, please, come in

00:24:13.550 --> 00:24:14.633
and support my restaurant.

00:24:14.633 --> 00:24:17.580
And they will say, I don't
want to eat near a graveyard.

00:24:17.580 --> 00:24:19.500
And that would be,
like, oh my god,

00:24:19.500 --> 00:24:22.810
would I ever get out of this?

00:24:22.810 --> 00:24:24.610
It was, like,
something which was

00:24:24.610 --> 00:24:28.510
so scary for an immigrant
who was brown at that point,

00:24:28.510 --> 00:24:34.420
standing right on the site, who
wanted to be of some support

00:24:34.420 --> 00:24:37.110
to even one soul at that point.

00:24:37.110 --> 00:24:41.480
And at that same point, we
had some riots in Queens.

00:24:41.480 --> 00:24:43.630
And a lot of Sikhs
were-- there was

00:24:43.630 --> 00:24:45.660
a bit assault and everything.

00:24:45.660 --> 00:24:47.430
And that is, again, pre-Google.

00:24:47.430 --> 00:24:48.730
And we don't have those images.

00:24:48.730 --> 00:24:51.240
Right now, we can get images
of what is a "lunger."

00:24:51.240 --> 00:24:53.110
"Lunger" is a
community kitchen which

00:24:53.110 --> 00:24:55.560
comes from the
Sikh temples, where

00:24:55.560 --> 00:24:57.640
the whole institution
of Sikhism is

00:24:57.640 --> 00:25:01.470
based on that everyone is equal.

00:25:01.470 --> 00:25:04.100
There's no sense of division
of societies in them.

00:25:04.100 --> 00:25:05.680
So when you look
at lunger, where

00:25:05.680 --> 00:25:10.070
I learned how to cook-- so
I drew a painting of a Sikh

00:25:10.070 --> 00:25:12.060
who was serving a little
child, a beggar child.

00:25:12.060 --> 00:25:14.375
I don't know I was
imagining myself as a child

00:25:14.375 --> 00:25:17.210
or I was imagining myself
as-- So I drew a sketch,

00:25:17.210 --> 00:25:18.240
and I stood on the site.

00:25:18.240 --> 00:25:22.340
And I kept telling people,
you know, these are Sikhs.

00:25:22.340 --> 00:25:23.210
They are different.

00:25:23.210 --> 00:25:27.150
These are the people
who actually raised me.

00:25:27.150 --> 00:25:28.940
And there was one
professor from NYU.

00:25:28.940 --> 00:25:33.700
He asked me saying,
why're you doing this?

00:25:33.700 --> 00:25:38.470
I said, even if I could tell one
person the story of who we are.

00:25:38.470 --> 00:25:41.920
Everybody has to
tell their own story.

00:25:41.920 --> 00:25:45.391
And he said continue to do this.

00:25:45.391 --> 00:25:48.190
This is the conviction which
will make you stand out

00:25:48.190 --> 00:25:52.240
in the United States of America,
that I saw you standing there

00:25:52.240 --> 00:25:53.420
for two hours.

00:25:53.420 --> 00:25:55.386
No one spoke to you.

00:25:55.386 --> 00:25:58.194
You were invisible.

00:25:58.194 --> 00:25:58.860
IRFAN DAMA: Wow.

00:25:58.860 --> 00:26:01.068
VIKAS KHANNA: He's saying
you're invisible right now.

00:26:01.068 --> 00:26:04.010
But as long as you believe
it, you will become visible.

00:26:04.010 --> 00:26:07.459
So this plaque what you're
holding it, don't forget it.

00:26:07.459 --> 00:26:09.250
This is something which
is representing you

00:26:09.250 --> 00:26:10.974
and York City and your people.

00:26:10.974 --> 00:26:11.640
Don't forget it.

00:26:11.640 --> 00:26:14.740
And I remember that was a
very important somebody patted

00:26:14.740 --> 00:26:17.190
on her back, on like that
women who gave me blanket.

00:26:17.190 --> 00:26:20.650
It was a similar kind
of moment for me.

00:26:20.650 --> 00:26:23.970
When I said that it is very
important if you believe

00:26:23.970 --> 00:26:25.920
in something, you've
got to stand up.

00:26:25.920 --> 00:26:28.610
If you need to be counted,
you need to stand up.

00:26:28.610 --> 00:26:30.700
And that is something
which I learned

00:26:30.700 --> 00:26:36.300
because I was born with a very
strange physical disability,

00:26:36.300 --> 00:26:39.300
in which I never played
throughout my childhood.

00:26:39.300 --> 00:26:42.470
So I have no memory of
me playing at as a child.

00:26:42.470 --> 00:26:46.600
I had club feet, which is a very
common problem in First World

00:26:46.600 --> 00:26:50.910
countries, but in my part of
the world, that's a big problem.

00:26:50.910 --> 00:26:52.455
Your feet are inside,
you're a ghost.

00:26:55.420 --> 00:26:57.360
"But Mummy, I'm a ghost."

00:26:57.360 --> 00:27:00.260
That's what everybody
in the class tells me.

00:27:00.260 --> 00:27:03.130
But you learned how to stood up.

00:27:03.130 --> 00:27:06.250
And that is what I felt that it
is very important that what you

00:27:06.250 --> 00:27:09.300
do is it cannot come
from anywhere else.

00:27:09.300 --> 00:27:11.278
The source has to be within you.

00:27:11.278 --> 00:27:15.150
And I know, being a chef--
some people tell me.

00:27:15.150 --> 00:27:19.170
Just go care, who cares
what you're saying?

00:27:19.170 --> 00:27:21.200
No, it's important.

00:27:21.200 --> 00:27:24.290
It's important that I
share in what I believe in.

00:27:24.290 --> 00:27:27.680
Because what'll happen that this
all of these stories add up.

00:27:27.680 --> 00:27:31.194
And they become a small
epic of our own life.

00:27:31.194 --> 00:27:32.610
And that is what
my mom taught me.

00:27:32.610 --> 00:27:34.850
She's saying if somebody
says that you're

00:27:34.850 --> 00:27:38.764
a ghost, tell them
thank you, angel.

00:27:38.764 --> 00:27:39.430
IRFAN DAMA: Wow.

00:27:39.430 --> 00:27:40.638
VIKAS KHANNA: And I did that.

00:27:40.638 --> 00:27:41.420
I said, oh yeah.

00:27:41.420 --> 00:27:42.920
So the foundations
all of us started

00:27:42.920 --> 00:27:46.890
based on that there was an
equal amount of awareness.

00:27:46.890 --> 00:27:50.430
There was some things I did with
the Egyptian government right

00:27:50.430 --> 00:27:51.480
before they collapsed.

00:27:51.480 --> 00:27:54.920
And I wanted to have more
accessibility on the World

00:27:54.920 --> 00:27:55.420
Wonders.

00:27:55.420 --> 00:27:57.430
Now, you would say
why would you do that?

00:27:57.430 --> 00:28:00.440
Yeah, I figured out that
it was difficult for me

00:28:00.440 --> 00:28:01.835
to access some blessed places.

00:28:04.430 --> 00:28:07.590
So SAKIV was so much
based on creating events.

00:28:07.590 --> 00:28:09.840
We did events at the
pyramids, at the Taj Mahal.

00:28:09.840 --> 00:28:11.950
I want planning a
next one in Brazil.

00:28:11.950 --> 00:28:14.290
Maybe collect chefs and they
all put the energy and food

00:28:14.290 --> 00:28:15.120
into it.

00:28:15.120 --> 00:28:16.860
You create awareness of events.

00:28:16.860 --> 00:28:18.347
It's important.

00:28:18.347 --> 00:28:19.180
IRFAN DAMA: Mmm-hmm.

00:28:19.180 --> 00:28:20.515
I agree.

00:28:20.515 --> 00:28:21.890
Not to forget
where we come from.

00:28:21.890 --> 00:28:24.880
I want to spend some time
talking about your book.

00:28:24.880 --> 00:28:27.640
You've told us how long
you took to write the book.

00:28:27.640 --> 00:28:30.370
It's a big work in progress.

00:28:30.370 --> 00:28:33.460
But the most interesting thing--
there are a couple of things.

00:28:33.460 --> 00:28:35.550
I glanced through your book.

00:28:35.550 --> 00:28:37.000
And we spoke about
it over lunch.

00:28:37.000 --> 00:28:38.205
I hope you enjoyed
lunch, by the way.

00:28:38.205 --> 00:28:39.405
VIKAS KHANNA: Yes, great.

00:28:39.405 --> 00:28:40.560
IRFAN DAMA: It's a
big honor to have

00:28:40.560 --> 00:28:41.920
Vikas eating at my restaurant.

00:28:41.920 --> 00:28:42.960
That's so awesome.

00:28:42.960 --> 00:28:44.626
Google's restaurant,
I just [INAUDIBLE].

00:28:44.626 --> 00:28:45.222
[LAUGHTER]

00:28:45.222 --> 00:28:47.677
IRFAN DAMA: FYI.

00:28:47.677 --> 00:28:51.370
[HINDI]

00:28:51.370 --> 00:28:54.010
VIKAS KHANNA: We take everything
what we're successful.

00:28:54.010 --> 00:28:55.690
All successful things are ours.

00:28:55.690 --> 00:28:58.760
IRFAN DAMA: But the one thing
that I loved about the book

00:28:58.760 --> 00:29:02.700
is you started with the
Buddhist mealtime prayer.

00:29:02.700 --> 00:29:04.890
And how do people in the
Himalayan River Valley--

00:29:04.890 --> 00:29:07.300
how do they view their
meals and the food they eat?

00:29:07.300 --> 00:29:10.560
And how is it so
different from what

00:29:10.560 --> 00:29:13.214
the Americans do and
their approach to food.

00:29:16.180 --> 00:29:18.520
VIKAS KHANNA: See, I
find it very difficult

00:29:18.520 --> 00:29:19.810
to compare two cultures.

00:29:19.810 --> 00:29:23.070
I have always had
this problem of living

00:29:23.070 --> 00:29:25.400
in two different countries.

00:29:25.400 --> 00:29:28.250
But one thing which I
love about appreciation

00:29:28.250 --> 00:29:31.684
of, when people have such
a high regard of, sharing.

00:29:31.684 --> 00:29:33.350
And there's a Buddhist
meal time prayer.

00:29:33.350 --> 00:29:36.380
And the book starts with,
saying that every grain is

00:29:36.380 --> 00:29:39.340
a the sacrifice of life.

00:29:39.340 --> 00:29:42.460
May I be worthy
of that sacrifice.

00:29:42.460 --> 00:29:44.550
May my unwholesome
qualities turn

00:29:44.550 --> 00:29:47.980
to wholesome qualities
when I consume this life.

00:29:47.980 --> 00:29:52.360
I thought that was
something so beautiful,

00:29:52.360 --> 00:29:56.510
because even if you're
consuming rice, that has life.

00:29:56.510 --> 00:29:59.570
It has the potential tomorrow
to fight against the gravity

00:29:59.570 --> 00:30:03.590
and rise to the sun
and create a new crop.

00:30:03.590 --> 00:30:05.005
That is sexy!

00:30:05.005 --> 00:30:06.294
[LAUGHTER]

00:30:06.294 --> 00:30:07.650
IRFAN DAMA: That is true.

00:30:07.650 --> 00:30:10.109
VIKAS KHANNA: When we look
at the magic of soil--

00:30:10.109 --> 00:30:11.150
we saw the movie "Vaali."

00:30:11.150 --> 00:30:15.270
And I was so affected
by "Vaali" that it

00:30:15.270 --> 00:30:17.260
is all about that
little sprout which

00:30:17.260 --> 00:30:20.980
defines our existence
on the planet.

00:30:20.980 --> 00:30:23.760
And that Buddhist
meal time prayer

00:30:23.760 --> 00:30:25.470
made me feel about
the little grain,

00:30:25.470 --> 00:30:28.700
that we are all-- the
day that we don't see it,

00:30:28.700 --> 00:30:31.830
we are all struggling for
that little sprout, which

00:30:31.830 --> 00:30:35.300
we don't even think is
so And in this prayer,

00:30:35.300 --> 00:30:39.140
they made that sprout as
the center of the universe.

00:30:39.140 --> 00:30:40.020
IRFAN DAMA: Wow.

00:30:40.020 --> 00:30:41.769
VIKAS KHANNA: So I was
I said the book has

00:30:41.769 --> 00:30:43.179
to start from that kind of note.

00:30:43.179 --> 00:30:44.595
And how Americans
eat differently.

00:30:47.770 --> 00:30:52.050
What Americans can do, the
rest of the world can do.

00:30:52.050 --> 00:30:53.010
We could create Google.

00:30:53.010 --> 00:30:55.850
The world just follows.

00:30:55.850 --> 00:30:58.710
I was Googling
Google headquarters

00:30:58.710 --> 00:31:02.345
and doesn't Google Maps before
coming to the Google office.

00:31:02.345 --> 00:31:04.756
How can you Google
more than that?

00:31:04.756 --> 00:31:05.256
[LAUGHTER]

00:31:05.256 --> 00:31:06.570
IRFAN DAMA: Exactly.

00:31:06.570 --> 00:31:09.010
VIKAS KHANNA: I'm like
are you serious, man?

00:31:11.940 --> 00:31:13.470
As you know, one
thing we also have

00:31:13.470 --> 00:31:19.350
to understand that America
is a reflection of the world.

00:31:19.350 --> 00:31:23.055
We see traces of the whole
world in the American hope

00:31:23.055 --> 00:31:25.660
or American dream.

00:31:25.660 --> 00:31:31.660
It's like there's something
so powerful when you have,

00:31:31.660 --> 00:31:33.690
when you meet American
kids who are--

00:31:33.690 --> 00:31:35.980
and I feel proud
every day to be part

00:31:35.980 --> 00:31:38.100
of that cycle in
some way at least.

00:31:38.100 --> 00:31:40.260
Even if I'm in the
kitchen in Junoon.

00:31:40.260 --> 00:31:44.010
And I'm feeding that creativity
of the American mind.

00:31:44.010 --> 00:31:46.920
This book-- on this
high commission

00:31:46.920 --> 00:31:52.405
could be produced in America,
because of the American--

00:31:52.405 --> 00:31:55.620
that curiosity to know more.

00:31:55.620 --> 00:31:57.594
And in this book I
said there are so

00:31:57.594 --> 00:31:59.260
many places where lot
of people will not

00:31:59.260 --> 00:32:03.010
be able to travel to Mustang,
which is northeast of Nepal,

00:32:03.010 --> 00:32:04.850
where Nepal people
have not gone.

00:32:04.850 --> 00:32:08.050
And it's like, it's so many
difficult places that where

00:32:08.050 --> 00:32:08.550
I went to.

00:32:08.550 --> 00:32:11.350
And I said where
people can't travel,

00:32:11.350 --> 00:32:13.190
I'm doing a small
thing of bringing

00:32:13.190 --> 00:32:17.120
that small piece of land of
Himalayas to their Kitchens

00:32:17.120 --> 00:32:18.400
through this book.

00:32:18.400 --> 00:32:21.110
So when you look at the American
creativity of thought process,

00:32:21.110 --> 00:32:23.460
that is something
which is so different.

00:32:23.460 --> 00:32:26.010
The way Americans think,
they way they write,

00:32:26.010 --> 00:32:29.710
the way they approach
in a very global way.

00:32:29.710 --> 00:32:32.050
That is something
which we all gravitate,

00:32:32.050 --> 00:32:35.010
and we aspire from it.

00:32:35.010 --> 00:32:37.930
I could have never thought this
as a very important project

00:32:37.930 --> 00:32:40.540
if I was living in Amritsar.

00:32:40.540 --> 00:32:41.520
IRFAN DAMA: Right.

00:32:41.520 --> 00:32:43.436
VIKAS KHANNA: I possibly
would've never taught

00:32:43.436 --> 00:32:47.210
that Himalayas could be
something so large and massive

00:32:47.210 --> 00:32:50.680
and splendor of the food and
the culture and the people.

00:32:50.680 --> 00:32:52.870
Till you came to America
and you figured out

00:32:52.870 --> 00:32:55.785
that it's so important.

00:32:55.785 --> 00:32:57.410
IRFAN DAMA: I glanced
through the book.

00:32:57.410 --> 00:33:02.080
The book truly
excited me-- mostly.

00:33:02.080 --> 00:33:05.835
[HINDI] I'm going to
get you to sign it.

00:33:05.835 --> 00:33:06.460
No, I got this.

00:33:06.460 --> 00:33:07.580
But I read through this.

00:33:07.580 --> 00:33:10.740
And a lot of the recipes
really fascinated me.

00:33:10.740 --> 00:33:14.900
And I'm definitely going to use
these recipes in my restaurant.

00:33:14.900 --> 00:33:17.240
I'm going to have
a Vikas Khanna Day.

00:33:17.240 --> 00:33:19.120
I love so many--
the simplicity is

00:33:19.120 --> 00:33:23.640
what touched me-- the
simple mustard greens.

00:33:23.640 --> 00:33:25.634
They're such incredibly
simple dishes,

00:33:25.634 --> 00:33:27.050
but the one thing--
and I told you

00:33:27.050 --> 00:33:29.470
I was going to ask you this
question-- is about the 108

00:33:29.470 --> 00:33:31.070
caves of meditation potatoes.

00:33:31.070 --> 00:33:31.440
VIKAS KHANNA: Yeah, yeah.

00:33:31.440 --> 00:33:32.689
It's a very interesting place.

00:33:32.689 --> 00:33:34.760
It's near Llasa.

00:33:34.760 --> 00:33:41.100
It's approximately three hours
drive from Llasa in Tibet.

00:33:41.100 --> 00:33:43.910
And I went to Tibet
because-- we all

00:33:43.910 --> 00:33:47.410
go to Tibet because
we love His Holiness.

00:33:47.410 --> 00:33:49.520
It's something
about Potala Palace,

00:33:49.520 --> 00:33:54.620
which is the-- and Potala is
fantastic, if anybody has not

00:33:54.620 --> 00:33:56.340
Googled it, must Google it.

00:33:56.340 --> 00:33:58.930
It had a red side
and the white side.

00:33:58.930 --> 00:34:02.110
Right side is the Parliament
or the political side.

00:34:02.110 --> 00:34:04.600
So he says the white side
is a spirituality side.

00:34:04.600 --> 00:34:08.283
So he says that both teams
have been balanced in sync.

00:34:08.283 --> 00:34:10.449
And it is like approximately
three hours from there.

00:34:10.449 --> 00:34:15.159
There is a place where they
have 108 caves on the mountains.

00:34:15.159 --> 00:34:19.489
So I decided one day I'm going
to go to all those 118 caves.

00:34:19.489 --> 00:34:22.440
And on the way, they
had these two things

00:34:22.440 --> 00:34:24.000
which were fantastic.

00:34:24.000 --> 00:34:26.144
One is they served
these potatoes, which

00:34:26.144 --> 00:34:28.346
are boiled potatoes, and
they come in a plastic bag

00:34:28.346 --> 00:34:29.179
and with chopsticks.

00:34:29.179 --> 00:34:31.980
And you keep feeding
that starch as you

00:34:31.980 --> 00:34:33.380
travel through these mountains.

00:34:33.380 --> 00:34:36.409
And there was a second
thing which was so shocking.

00:34:36.409 --> 00:34:38.600
It's a true example
of our existence

00:34:38.600 --> 00:34:41.300
that how we define our
cuisines and how we actually

00:34:41.300 --> 00:34:43.449
continue to live and thrive.

00:34:43.449 --> 00:34:46.590
VIKAS KHANNA: They had
made a small kind of a-- it

00:34:46.590 --> 00:34:51.254
looked like a soap-- a batch
of potato starch, which

00:34:51.254 --> 00:34:54.892
was boiled, and made
into this small block.

00:34:54.892 --> 00:34:56.860
It was sitting there.

00:34:56.860 --> 00:34:58.200
And it's noodles actually.

00:34:58.200 --> 00:35:00.750
So I'm like OK, but
where are the noodles.

00:35:00.750 --> 00:35:04.317
And the woman is, like,
could you be little patient?

00:35:04.317 --> 00:35:05.400
But where are the noodles?

00:35:05.400 --> 00:35:06.260
This is just a block.

00:35:06.260 --> 00:35:06.760
You cut it.

00:35:06.760 --> 00:35:08.020
What do you do with it?

00:35:08.020 --> 00:35:11.280
So they have this small kind
of a piece of a-- like a lid.

00:35:11.280 --> 00:35:14.720
You know the lids which come out
of the tuna box and everything

00:35:14.720 --> 00:35:17.200
So that kind of little
finger handle, and then

00:35:17.200 --> 00:35:19.070
she had made holes in it.

00:35:19.070 --> 00:35:21.730
So what she would do that
she wants to slide over

00:35:21.730 --> 00:35:24.980
that little block of
potato starch block,

00:35:24.980 --> 00:35:26.812
and the noodles will come out.

00:35:26.812 --> 00:35:27.520
It's in the book.

00:35:27.520 --> 00:35:29.840
And I'm looking at
this, and I was, like,

00:35:29.840 --> 00:35:32.520
wow, that is fantastic.

00:35:32.520 --> 00:35:34.262
So what she does is
that she makes them

00:35:34.262 --> 00:35:36.470
and then she tosses with a
little bit of garlic chili

00:35:36.470 --> 00:35:37.430
oil and all those things.

00:35:37.430 --> 00:35:39.360
But one thing which I also
found very interesting

00:35:39.360 --> 00:35:40.734
is-- I'm not going
against China.

00:35:40.734 --> 00:35:42.950
Please nobody quote
that-- but I found

00:35:42.950 --> 00:35:46.390
a pasta making machine which
is more than 1,000 years old

00:35:46.390 --> 00:35:48.427
in northwest of Bhutan.

00:35:48.427 --> 00:35:50.260
And I'm going to show
you a picture of that.

00:35:50.260 --> 00:35:54.280
And it is like a
huge lemon press,

00:35:54.280 --> 00:35:56.300
like the lemon press
we have to squeeze

00:35:56.300 --> 00:35:58.310
lemon juice or the garlic press?

00:35:58.310 --> 00:36:00.010
They had this kind
of wooden thing.

00:36:00.010 --> 00:36:02.850
Now, this is that potato
noodles with chili paste.

00:36:02.850 --> 00:36:06.090
This is how she figured
out that there's

00:36:06.090 --> 00:36:09.680
a big block of potato
starch thing which

00:36:09.680 --> 00:36:12.000
was potato starch
just cooked in water

00:36:12.000 --> 00:36:14.490
and which was quite
like thick like gelatin.

00:36:14.490 --> 00:36:16.320
It's very much like jelly.

00:36:16.320 --> 00:36:18.950
And then she scraps it
with this little thing.

00:36:18.950 --> 00:36:21.184
And this is what comes out.

00:36:21.184 --> 00:36:21.850
IRFAN DAMA: Wow.

00:36:21.850 --> 00:36:25.760
VIKAS KHANNA: And I was like,
this is a beautiful story.

00:36:25.760 --> 00:36:27.525
So the whole book
when it was created,

00:36:27.525 --> 00:36:31.550
it was almost 2,600
pages of research.

00:36:31.550 --> 00:36:33.480
The whole book would've
gone-- but then

00:36:33.480 --> 00:36:37.030
it will become very
unuser-friendly, and cost

00:36:37.030 --> 00:36:39.140
effective.

00:36:39.140 --> 00:36:40.510
Shipping will be a problem.

00:36:40.510 --> 00:36:41.820
IRFAN DAMA: Exactly.

00:36:41.820 --> 00:36:43.700
I can tell you right
now, I can't serve that.

00:36:43.700 --> 00:36:47.651
To make that for 1,000 bowls,
I think my hand will fall off.

00:36:47.651 --> 00:36:48.150
[LAUGHTER]

00:36:48.150 --> 00:36:52.790
VIKAS KHANNA: You know, practice
is what makes them so fast.

00:36:52.790 --> 00:36:54.290
One scrape, and bowl is ready.

00:36:54.290 --> 00:36:57.140
How fast she was.

00:36:57.140 --> 00:36:58.970
And there's one
more thing which I

00:36:58.970 --> 00:37:03.130
want to say about the
dedication page of this book.

00:37:03.130 --> 00:37:07.190
This book is dedicated to
this woman whom I don't know,

00:37:07.190 --> 00:37:10.910
and I will never possibly
be able to meet her again.

00:37:10.910 --> 00:37:14.240
I'm quite forgetful,
and I know that.

00:37:14.240 --> 00:37:17.410
So I had this small computer
VAIO, that black one,

00:37:17.410 --> 00:37:19.410
the cheapest one I used to have.

00:37:19.410 --> 00:37:21.530
So I had everything
documented there,

00:37:21.530 --> 00:37:24.280
and this is the last
stop, 108 caves.

00:37:24.280 --> 00:37:25.790
So there was a
small place, which

00:37:25.790 --> 00:37:29.390
was like last time I'm
going to have butter tea.

00:37:29.390 --> 00:37:32.400
So I wanted to have my last
butter tea in total peace.

00:37:32.400 --> 00:37:35.830
And then we had a small
van-- like the Maruti van

00:37:35.830 --> 00:37:37.520
which used to come in India.

00:37:37.520 --> 00:37:39.500
It's a 10-seater van.

00:37:39.500 --> 00:37:41.710
My driver is like run, run, run!

00:37:41.710 --> 00:37:47.630
So I ran out, and I forgot
my laptop in the bag next

00:37:47.630 --> 00:37:50.110
to my chair.

00:37:50.110 --> 00:37:53.404
And I forgot, and
I'm totally excited.

00:37:53.404 --> 00:37:55.570
And now I'm getting carried
away with the new sights

00:37:55.570 --> 00:37:56.380
and everything.

00:37:56.380 --> 00:37:57.588
I still had my little camera.

00:37:57.588 --> 00:37:58.940
I took all this pictures myself.

00:37:58.940 --> 00:38:01.440
So I'm clicking more images.

00:38:01.440 --> 00:38:03.350
And suddenly, the bus stopped.

00:38:03.350 --> 00:38:07.480
There was a Tibetan woman
from the top of the hill.

00:38:07.480 --> 00:38:11.514
She ran down the slope to
give my computer back to me.

00:38:11.514 --> 00:38:12.756
IRFAN DAMA: Wow.

00:38:12.756 --> 00:38:13.819
Incredible.

00:38:13.819 --> 00:38:16.360
VIKAS KHANNA: And I'm trying to
give her something, because I

00:38:16.360 --> 00:38:17.693
don't know how to react to this.

00:38:17.693 --> 00:38:21.950
Like nobody has done this
kind of running for me.

00:38:21.950 --> 00:38:24.420
So she shrugged, and she
said something in Tibetan.

00:38:24.420 --> 00:38:25.970
I asked the driver.

00:38:25.970 --> 00:38:28.250
She said that anyone
would have done that.

00:38:28.250 --> 00:38:30.050
IRFAN DAMA: Wow.

00:38:30.050 --> 00:38:33.192
VIKAS KHANNA: And she must
have that ran about two miles,

00:38:33.192 --> 00:38:35.410
more than that.

00:38:35.410 --> 00:38:38.440
And that sight never leaves me.

00:38:38.440 --> 00:38:41.100
You know, the married women
wear apron-looking dresses,

00:38:41.100 --> 00:38:43.480
and they are so beautiful.

00:38:43.480 --> 00:38:48.530
She must be in her 60s, but
her running down that hill

00:38:48.530 --> 00:38:53.060
and giving me the computer is
why this book is born today.

00:38:53.060 --> 00:38:57.030
I would have lost almost all my
data, everything, all images.

00:38:57.030 --> 00:39:02.260
And more than that, I would
have lost hope that I can do it.

00:39:02.260 --> 00:39:04.160
And that hope led
to another hope,

00:39:04.160 --> 00:39:06.760
and that led to another
hope, which got me here.

00:39:06.760 --> 00:39:09.670
IRFAN DAMA: That is incredible.

00:39:09.670 --> 00:39:12.080
I have to tell you I
spent two years in Delhi,

00:39:12.080 --> 00:39:13.830
when I worked at the
[INAUDIBLE] Sheraton.

00:39:13.830 --> 00:39:15.913
And that was when I was
first introduced to momos.

00:39:15.913 --> 00:39:18.000
I'd never heard about
momos before that.

00:39:18.000 --> 00:39:21.294
There was a small little
restaurant in chana ke puri,

00:39:21.294 --> 00:39:23.210
where all the [INAUDIBLE]
students used to go.

00:39:23.210 --> 00:39:24.430
And they would have momos.

00:39:24.430 --> 00:39:26.221
And I think the first
time, I had a thing--

00:39:26.221 --> 00:39:28.336
it had 60 momos or something.

00:39:28.336 --> 00:39:30.030
It was so good.

00:39:30.030 --> 00:39:33.502
So you have covered momos to
great degree in this book.

00:39:33.502 --> 00:39:35.210
Give us something real
quick about momos.

00:39:35.210 --> 00:39:36.464
It's such an incredible dish.

00:39:36.464 --> 00:39:38.880
VIKAS KHANNA: You know, momos
is a very interesting dough.

00:39:38.880 --> 00:39:40.130
It's a very interesting dough.

00:39:40.130 --> 00:39:43.300
It's just flour, salt and water.

00:39:43.300 --> 00:39:45.410
And then use your instinct.

00:39:45.410 --> 00:39:48.640
It needs to be a firm dough,
because if you let it rest,

00:39:48.640 --> 00:39:51.080
cover with a wet cloth
for half an hour.

00:39:51.080 --> 00:39:51.940
That's all you need.

00:39:51.940 --> 00:39:54.590
But lot of people when
I was doing any classes

00:39:54.590 --> 00:39:56.990
or doing my training of my
own chefs in the restaurant,

00:39:56.990 --> 00:39:58.920
we were worried about
the shape of the momos,

00:39:58.920 --> 00:40:01.640
you know that intricate
shape, in which we

00:40:01.640 --> 00:40:03.870
do touch a lot of that
shapes in his book.

00:40:03.870 --> 00:40:06.450
But one thing was which
is-- I tell them, tell

00:40:06.450 --> 00:40:08.960
people who cares
how the shape is.

00:40:08.960 --> 00:40:11.640
But the beauty of momos
is that you can stuff them

00:40:11.640 --> 00:40:15.550
with anything you have, any
leftovers, any restaurant

00:40:15.550 --> 00:40:16.420
food which is left.

00:40:16.420 --> 00:40:18.726
It needs to be dry for sure.

00:40:18.726 --> 00:40:20.100
And if you have
minced meat, just

00:40:20.100 --> 00:40:21.780
add some salt and
lemon juice to it.

00:40:21.780 --> 00:40:23.360
You could just stuff that in.

00:40:23.360 --> 00:40:25.640
Steaming is a great
healthy way to eat.

00:40:25.640 --> 00:40:27.530
But one more thing,
which I figured out,

00:40:27.530 --> 00:40:29.720
that you could actually
make momos with whole wheat

00:40:29.720 --> 00:40:30.860
flour too.

00:40:30.860 --> 00:40:33.120
And you can use a
lot of greens too.

00:40:33.120 --> 00:40:39.460
And this is one of my
favorite test stories about.

00:40:39.460 --> 00:40:42.370
I go to this woman's house.

00:40:42.370 --> 00:40:43.140
This is in Paro.

00:40:46.040 --> 00:40:47.550
It's the capital of Bhutan.

00:40:47.550 --> 00:40:49.536
This is actually the
only city in the world

00:40:49.536 --> 00:40:52.224
where there's no traffic lights.

00:40:52.224 --> 00:40:53.640
I think there's
one traffic signal

00:40:53.640 --> 00:40:56.540
in Bhutan, the whole
of the country.

00:40:56.540 --> 00:40:59.990
And nobody breaks traffic rules!

00:40:59.990 --> 00:41:02.470
When I got my driver's
license-- again,

00:41:02.470 --> 00:41:06.929
I come back to driving-- in
Bhutan, they drive so well.

00:41:06.929 --> 00:41:08.470
They have so much
respect for nature.

00:41:08.470 --> 00:41:09.136
They don't honk.

00:41:09.136 --> 00:41:10.670
They don't do anything.

00:41:10.670 --> 00:41:11.980
I don't know.

00:41:11.980 --> 00:41:13.730
It's a totally different
thought process,

00:41:13.730 --> 00:41:15.456
in which they say,
we don't honk,

00:41:15.456 --> 00:41:17.080
not to disturb the
other driver, but we

00:41:17.080 --> 00:41:19.180
don't honk to
disturb the nature.

00:41:19.180 --> 00:41:19.945
IRFAN DAMA: Wow.

00:41:19.945 --> 00:41:21.320
VIKAS KHANNA: So
I was like, wow.

00:41:21.320 --> 00:41:24.530
So this woman has this, and she
is making me the butter tea.

00:41:24.530 --> 00:41:26.100
If you've ever seen
this movie called

00:41:26.100 --> 00:41:28.950
"Seven years in Tibet,
with Brad Pitt,"

00:41:28.950 --> 00:41:32.770
the last line of the movie
is that "Butter tea was never

00:41:32.770 --> 00:41:34.410
my cup of tea."

00:41:34.410 --> 00:41:39.530
This is a tea, which is made
with tea, little bit of milk,

00:41:39.530 --> 00:41:44.270
water, lots of yak
butter, and salt.

00:41:44.270 --> 00:41:46.850
I know it doesn't
sounds delicious at all.

00:41:46.850 --> 00:41:47.982
It is not.

00:41:47.982 --> 00:41:49.325
[LAUGHTER]

00:41:49.325 --> 00:41:50.700
VIKAS KHANNA:
First sip, you will

00:41:50.700 --> 00:41:54.170
say I can't be having this
floating grease in my mouth,

00:41:54.170 --> 00:41:55.930
like are you serious?

00:41:55.930 --> 00:41:58.790
But you went to anyone's
house, it was there.

00:41:58.790 --> 00:42:03.237
So I write about this that I got
so upset with this butter tea.

00:42:03.237 --> 00:42:04.820
So in my little
apartment in Manhattan

00:42:04.820 --> 00:42:09.500
which is the size of a matchbox,
it only smelled of butter tea.

00:42:09.500 --> 00:42:12.240
So anyone who'd come to
visit me, I'll [INAUDIBLE].

00:42:12.240 --> 00:42:14.309
And people are,
like, are you weird?

00:42:14.309 --> 00:42:15.850
We're never coming
back to your house

00:42:15.850 --> 00:42:19.250
again if this is the next time
you're going to do this to us.

00:42:19.250 --> 00:42:24.980
But this woman, had this
kind of a stirrer, a whisk,

00:42:24.980 --> 00:42:28.000
which is from a tree.

00:42:28.000 --> 00:42:30.740
So I asked her can I have that?

00:42:30.740 --> 00:42:33.520
She said you can have anything,
but you can't have this.

00:42:33.520 --> 00:42:36.252
It was given to me
by my mother-in-law.

00:42:36.252 --> 00:42:37.470
I said OK.

00:42:37.470 --> 00:42:40.375
So I loved that.

00:42:40.375 --> 00:42:42.540
A whisk I could not buy.

00:42:42.540 --> 00:42:45.085
But I wanted to take a picture
of it to put in the book

00:42:45.085 --> 00:42:47.385
and say, eventually,
when I was walking out,

00:42:47.385 --> 00:42:49.010
her daughter gave it
to me, because she

00:42:49.010 --> 00:42:52.840
saw that my heart was like
oh my god, that's a whisk?

00:42:52.840 --> 00:42:54.620
It looked exactly like a whisk.

00:42:54.620 --> 00:42:55.920
It's a top of a tree.

00:42:55.920 --> 00:42:57.460
And they use that to make tea.

00:42:57.460 --> 00:43:00.680
I thought this is really great.

00:43:00.680 --> 00:43:05.010
And I thought, that organicness
is something which connects us

00:43:05.010 --> 00:43:09.010
all to something which is
very pure, that simplicity.

00:43:09.010 --> 00:43:10.760
IRFAN DAMA: That is
very, very incredible.

00:43:10.760 --> 00:43:14.300
I have to ask you that
incredible story you told us

00:43:14.300 --> 00:43:18.010
in 2005 when the Dalai
Lama touched your forehead.

00:43:18.010 --> 00:43:21.620
And then, you now have him
writing the forward in "Return

00:43:21.620 --> 00:43:22.410
to the Rivers."

00:43:22.410 --> 00:43:25.400
How did that
happen-- you managed

00:43:25.400 --> 00:43:28.190
to get him writing
for your book.

00:43:28.190 --> 00:43:29.050
That's incredible.

00:43:29.050 --> 00:43:30.714
Tell us about it.

00:43:30.714 --> 00:43:31.630
VIKAS KHANNA: Destiny?

00:43:34.450 --> 00:43:35.470
Pure destiny.

00:43:38.810 --> 00:43:42.410
I always feel that
there was something

00:43:42.410 --> 00:43:45.680
so honest in what I was doing,
when I was writing this.

00:43:45.680 --> 00:43:49.030
I was not worried about if my
next meal is going to come,

00:43:49.030 --> 00:43:51.200
what is going to
happen to my life.

00:43:51.200 --> 00:43:53.850
It's like what am I doing?

00:43:53.850 --> 00:43:56.480
But there was something in the
universe which was constantly

00:43:56.480 --> 00:44:00.760
guiding me and telling me you
are doing the right thing, son.

00:44:00.760 --> 00:44:02.390
And it was something
is telling me

00:44:02.390 --> 00:44:06.300
that I choose people
to do projects,

00:44:06.300 --> 00:44:08.350
like there was a
bigger power telling me

00:44:08.350 --> 00:44:10.000
that you didn't
choose this project.

00:44:10.000 --> 00:44:12.420
I chose you to do this project.

00:44:12.420 --> 00:44:15.540
And when I met his Holiness,
he was asking me questions.

00:44:15.540 --> 00:44:17.890
He was literally
trying to test me.

00:44:17.890 --> 00:44:20.080
So I went for
meditation with him.

00:44:20.080 --> 00:44:22.330
And Kalachakra is the
biggest Buddhist congregation

00:44:22.330 --> 00:44:23.990
which happens in Bodh Gaya.

00:44:23.990 --> 00:44:27.710
Bodh Gaya is a place in India
where Buddha was enlightened.

00:44:27.710 --> 00:44:30.480
So at Kalachakra, we
have lot of people.

00:44:30.480 --> 00:44:32.840
And I thought I will never
get to be sitting with him,

00:44:32.840 --> 00:44:35.580
because Richard Gere's there,
and everybody from Hollywood

00:44:35.580 --> 00:44:36.080
there.

00:44:36.080 --> 00:44:38.750
And [INAUDIBLE] looking at me.

00:44:38.750 --> 00:44:40.320
Basically, he pulls me on.

00:44:40.320 --> 00:44:45.766
And he starts talking
to me about the project.

00:44:45.766 --> 00:44:47.170
I'm, like, really?

00:44:47.170 --> 00:44:48.700
And then there was
another guy who

00:44:48.700 --> 00:44:50.340
was there, who was
complaining nonstop.

00:44:50.340 --> 00:44:52.820
Oh you don't know, I
have so much money.

00:44:52.820 --> 00:44:55.480
But I don't understand
why my kids left me,

00:44:55.480 --> 00:44:59.710
my wife is getting married
and she didn't inform me.

00:44:59.710 --> 00:45:02.130
And my [INAUDIBLE] that at
him, and say "my friend,

00:45:02.130 --> 00:45:03.476
you need scotch."

00:45:03.476 --> 00:45:06.260
[LAUGHTER]

00:45:06.260 --> 00:45:08.391
VIKAS KHANNA: Stop
complaining, he tells that way.

00:45:08.391 --> 00:45:09.404
He does!

00:45:09.404 --> 00:45:10.820
You think, you
started this intent

00:45:10.820 --> 00:45:12.670
through saying that
you are so rich.

00:45:12.670 --> 00:45:15.510
Stop feeling bad about yourself.

00:45:15.510 --> 00:45:16.905
Stop feeling bad.

00:45:16.905 --> 00:45:18.280
On top of that,
you're telling me

00:45:18.280 --> 00:45:21.470
how poor you are because
you can't connect to anyone?

00:45:21.470 --> 00:45:24.840
And I'm like oh my God, look
at his presence of mind.

00:45:24.840 --> 00:45:27.620
And then he tells me--
immediately, looks at you, says

00:45:27.620 --> 00:45:30.092
did you go to-- I said, yes.

00:45:30.092 --> 00:45:31.070
I went to Amdo.

00:45:31.070 --> 00:45:32.990
Bundle is his birthplace.

00:45:35.820 --> 00:45:39.390
I knew it somehow that he's
going to ask me that question.

00:45:39.390 --> 00:45:41.430
I don't know why.

00:45:41.430 --> 00:45:44.570
And I said I learned how to
make your favorite bread there.

00:45:44.570 --> 00:45:47.070
It's "Amdo Bread" in the book.

00:45:47.070 --> 00:45:48.700
And he just kept
holding my hand.

00:45:48.700 --> 00:45:51.160
And that guy kept
complaining in the behind.

00:45:51.160 --> 00:45:53.930
Like, but what do you want
me to do it with my life?

00:45:53.930 --> 00:45:55.980
You know, I have so much money.

00:45:55.980 --> 00:45:59.150
He does this to
get him to shut up.

00:45:59.150 --> 00:46:03.660
But he wanted to hear
the story of bread,

00:46:03.660 --> 00:46:05.900
which is his childhood bread.

00:46:05.900 --> 00:46:11.560
He goes back to Dharamshala
and within almost three weeks,

00:46:11.560 --> 00:46:15.290
I get a letter from his
office, about congratulating me

00:46:15.290 --> 00:46:17.246
of accomplishing this project.

00:46:17.246 --> 00:46:19.600
And that's the forward.

00:46:19.600 --> 00:46:20.720
IRFAN DAMA: Incredible.

00:46:20.720 --> 00:46:22.428
I don't know how many
people in the world

00:46:22.428 --> 00:46:24.360
would be able to have this.

00:46:24.360 --> 00:46:26.110
I am so impressed.

00:46:26.110 --> 00:46:30.060
I've got to ask you one last
question as a chef looking

00:46:30.060 --> 00:46:30.560
to you.

00:46:30.560 --> 00:46:33.330
You have accomplished so much.

00:46:33.330 --> 00:46:34.096
It's so much.

00:46:34.096 --> 00:46:35.970
I mean, we could never
dream of accomplishing

00:46:35.970 --> 00:46:38.850
13 books and so
many appearances.

00:46:38.850 --> 00:46:40.369
But you don't take time to rest.

00:46:40.369 --> 00:46:42.410
Is there going to be time
for life any time soon.

00:46:42.410 --> 00:46:44.420
Is there going to be
a Mrs. Vikas Khanna?

00:46:44.420 --> 00:46:44.957
[LAUGHTER]

00:46:44.957 --> 00:46:47.040
IRFAN DAMA: Someday, are
you going to take a break

00:46:47.040 --> 00:46:49.670
and just say time to enjoy
what I have accomplished?

00:46:52.620 --> 00:46:56.690
VIKAS KHANNA: I feel that
this platform is fantastic.

00:46:56.690 --> 00:46:58.630
I went to launch
this book in India.

00:46:58.630 --> 00:47:04.330
I wanted my motherland
to see this book first.

00:47:04.330 --> 00:47:08.220
I don't know what--
I'm not that patriotic.

00:47:08.220 --> 00:47:11.360
I take it is as I feel.

00:47:11.360 --> 00:47:14.790
So Jaipur Lit Festival is
the largest literary festival

00:47:14.790 --> 00:47:16.895
in India, where
Oprah went last year

00:47:16.895 --> 00:47:19.020
and then before that, Deepak
Chopra's spoken there.

00:47:19.020 --> 00:47:21.200
Salman Rushdie was not
allowed to speak there,

00:47:21.200 --> 00:47:22.240
but I was allowed.

00:47:24.431 --> 00:47:25.430
IRFAN DAMA: Good on you!

00:47:25.430 --> 00:47:26.975
Good on you!

00:47:26.975 --> 00:47:28.180
Excellent.

00:47:28.180 --> 00:47:30.670
VIKAS KHANNA: So they never
had a chef there before,

00:47:30.670 --> 00:47:33.010
Jaipur Lit Festival.

00:47:33.010 --> 00:47:35.260
They never had a
cookbook launch there.

00:47:35.260 --> 00:47:38.680
It's the largest South
Asian literary festival,

00:47:38.680 --> 00:47:39.804
and I'm just going there.

00:47:39.804 --> 00:47:41.220
And I'm a little
worried because I

00:47:41.220 --> 00:47:42.650
know there's going
to be a lot of press.

00:47:42.650 --> 00:47:44.580
So I'm asking the
people at the festival,

00:47:44.580 --> 00:47:49.110
do you rent people just
to fill up my place?

00:47:49.110 --> 00:47:50.790
I don't want to be
standing there alone,

00:47:50.790 --> 00:47:54.480
that, OK, I came all the way
from America to open this book.

00:47:54.480 --> 00:47:57.215
So all throughout, I'm asking
people, so can you come?

00:47:57.215 --> 00:47:58.340
They say, yeah, we'll come.

00:47:58.340 --> 00:48:01.330
It's like I can pay you guys.

00:48:01.330 --> 00:48:03.730
I'm thinking I should
have 100 rupees notes

00:48:03.730 --> 00:48:05.590
and I would give it to everyone.

00:48:05.590 --> 00:48:06.674
Please come for this.

00:48:06.674 --> 00:48:08.090
So I go there,
there's a Bollywood

00:48:08.090 --> 00:48:09.700
director who's talking there.

00:48:09.700 --> 00:48:12.090
So he has almost like
100 people there.

00:48:12.090 --> 00:48:14.880
So I'm like can we
tell these people that

00:48:14.880 --> 00:48:16.480
after this that--
he thinks chef,

00:48:16.480 --> 00:48:17.930
can you be a little
less paranoid?

00:48:17.930 --> 00:48:19.860
You're scaring us.

00:48:19.860 --> 00:48:21.745
You know what, it's
going to such an insult,

00:48:21.745 --> 00:48:24.235
like, here I'm talking
that I don't want

00:48:24.235 --> 00:48:26.040
to open this book
in America first.

00:48:26.040 --> 00:48:28.291
I want to open this
book in India first.

00:48:28.291 --> 00:48:29.040
And I call my mom.

00:48:29.040 --> 00:48:30.740
And she's like no,
I'm not interested.

00:48:30.740 --> 00:48:32.644
[LAUGHTER]

00:48:32.644 --> 00:48:35.210
VIKAS KHANNA: I thought nobody's
ready to come to my book

00:48:35.210 --> 00:48:36.600
lecture.

00:48:36.600 --> 00:48:40.155
And they said we put you
in the Google Mughal tent.

00:48:42.500 --> 00:48:44.000
I said I don't know
what that means,

00:48:44.000 --> 00:48:46.110
that people have
to Google my tent?

00:48:46.110 --> 00:48:48.540
So there's a place in
Jaipur Lit Festival.

00:48:48.540 --> 00:48:50.560
it's called Google Mughal Tent.

00:48:50.560 --> 00:48:53.520
And they said chef, please,
we don't want your anxiety

00:48:53.520 --> 00:48:55.890
going all over the place.

00:48:55.890 --> 00:48:59.584
We have people waiting here
since last night in the tent.

00:48:59.584 --> 00:49:00.250
IRFAN DAMA: Wow.

00:49:00.250 --> 00:49:01.375
VIKAS KHANNA: I went there.

00:49:01.375 --> 00:49:05.070
They were more than
3,000 people waiting

00:49:05.070 --> 00:49:08.242
to see this book being
opened in front of them.

00:49:08.242 --> 00:49:09.200
IRFAN DAMA: Incredible.

00:49:09.200 --> 00:49:12.600
VIKAS KHANNA: So I felt that
was my bigger accomplishment

00:49:12.600 --> 00:49:15.020
than having a life
partner or having

00:49:15.020 --> 00:49:17.050
anything else in my life.

00:49:17.050 --> 00:49:18.990
I hold this book
like this, and I

00:49:18.990 --> 00:49:21.060
could hear people
yelling and crying.

00:49:21.060 --> 00:49:24.240
I said this is symbol of home.

00:49:24.240 --> 00:49:27.355
As I told, I'm there, and
I looked at all this kids.

00:49:27.355 --> 00:49:29.730
And then it was difficult for
me to get out of the crowd,

00:49:29.730 --> 00:49:32.910
because I disturbed that
whole festival for that day.

00:49:32.910 --> 00:49:34.100
I know that.

00:49:34.100 --> 00:49:37.760
Because I went up and
told them the story of why

00:49:37.760 --> 00:49:39.710
I came back home,
because I said,

00:49:39.710 --> 00:49:42.310
because in my favorite
book, Jonathan Livingston

00:49:42.310 --> 00:49:44.270
comes back home.

00:49:44.270 --> 00:49:46.560
I wanted to go back home
and see how the home was.

00:49:46.560 --> 00:49:47.760
IRFAN DAMA: Wonderful.

00:49:47.760 --> 00:49:51.750
Well, just by saying that
you've no time for a life

00:49:51.750 --> 00:49:55.030
or a wife-- the
sexiest chef around.

00:49:55.030 --> 00:49:58.740
I don't know how many hearts
are broken in the audience.

00:49:58.740 --> 00:50:02.490
But truly, an incredible story.

00:50:02.490 --> 00:50:05.990
You know, how you can tell you
that you talked to a real chef?

00:50:05.990 --> 00:50:07.770
This is from a tandoor.

00:50:07.770 --> 00:50:09.360
His hands are
really, really worn.

00:50:09.360 --> 00:50:10.193
These scarred hands.

00:50:10.193 --> 00:50:12.860
VIKAS KHANNA: You never
need to go for waxing.

00:50:12.860 --> 00:50:14.700
Everything is
burned, everything.

00:50:14.700 --> 00:50:16.490
You never need to ever for it.

00:50:16.490 --> 00:50:18.710
If everybody wants to go
get a nice free waxing, say,

00:50:18.710 --> 00:50:20.550
can I put my hand
in the tandoor?

00:50:20.550 --> 00:50:23.070
So you get perfect clean waxing.

00:50:23.070 --> 00:50:24.910
People ask me, so you wax?

00:50:24.910 --> 00:50:26.270
I said, no.

00:50:26.270 --> 00:50:27.960
Oh but you have
you're waxed one hand.

00:50:27.960 --> 00:50:28.793
IRFAN DAMA: Tandoor.

00:50:30.750 --> 00:50:32.090
And what an incredible story.

00:50:32.090 --> 00:50:34.870
I'm now going to open to
questions in the audience.

00:50:34.870 --> 00:50:37.735
Does anybody have any
questions for Vikas?

00:50:37.735 --> 00:50:40.159
Vinod here will hand
you the microphone,

00:50:40.159 --> 00:50:42.200
so if you have a question,
please raise your hand

00:50:42.200 --> 00:50:46.280
and Vinod will come over
and give you the microphone.

00:50:46.280 --> 00:50:49.252
AUDIENCE: Before 2005
and after, would you say

00:50:49.252 --> 00:50:50.960
was that anything that
different than you

00:50:50.960 --> 00:50:56.050
did, that you know
what you wanted

00:50:56.050 --> 00:50:58.020
and everything like
a lot of success.

00:50:58.020 --> 00:50:59.780
What was the difference
before and after?

00:51:01.955 --> 00:51:03.830
VIKAS KHANNA: The biggest
difference, I felt,

00:51:03.830 --> 00:51:12.860
was that there was a time
when the transitional time

00:51:12.860 --> 00:51:15.800
of Indian cuisine, I would
say, from their reference,

00:51:15.800 --> 00:51:18.770
that a lot of people, a lot
of friends, we would meet,

00:51:18.770 --> 00:51:23.870
who were totally in not very
approval of Indian cuisine.

00:51:23.870 --> 00:51:25.210
"I hate curry."

00:51:25.210 --> 00:51:27.980
Like, you know, I heard
that word many times.

00:51:27.980 --> 00:51:30.580
But after that, I was convinced.

00:51:30.580 --> 00:51:36.570
I would patronize the
cuisine, not the people.

00:51:36.570 --> 00:51:40.510
If you patronize
something which is art,

00:51:40.510 --> 00:51:43.650
it is much bigger
than the people.

00:51:43.650 --> 00:51:45.410
I think that is
what I was convinced

00:51:45.410 --> 00:51:47.750
in 2005, when I'd
failed so many times.

00:51:47.750 --> 00:51:50.730
Because somebody would say
"change this," and I'll run.

00:51:50.730 --> 00:51:53.950
I'll change it, because I
wanted to patronize everyone.

00:51:53.950 --> 00:51:56.070
In the middle of this
whole transition,

00:51:56.070 --> 00:52:00.110
I forgot that I would
rather be a slave to art

00:52:00.110 --> 00:52:01.960
than to be to people.

00:52:01.960 --> 00:52:04.340
For me, the culture was the art.

00:52:04.340 --> 00:52:06.180
The food was the art.

00:52:06.180 --> 00:52:08.150
I just focused on
that after that.

00:52:08.150 --> 00:52:10.450
I just stopped worrying
about-- even now,

00:52:10.450 --> 00:52:13.140
when something has to be
done the right way, we do it.

00:52:13.140 --> 00:52:15.836
And I feel that people
respond more to that,

00:52:15.836 --> 00:52:17.710
than if you just keep
changing for everyone's

00:52:17.710 --> 00:52:20.850
individual perception.

00:52:20.850 --> 00:52:23.830
And yeah, I didn't
go to great schools.

00:52:23.830 --> 00:52:29.330
Initially, cooking was
the only thing I did.

00:52:29.330 --> 00:52:33.172
But one thing I figured out
you focus only on something

00:52:33.172 --> 00:52:34.130
you're convinced about.

00:52:36.660 --> 00:52:38.720
Rest is not important.

00:52:38.720 --> 00:52:41.916
Rest comes as a very
important by-product.

00:52:41.916 --> 00:52:45.710
I don't know if anything
made sense what I said.

00:52:45.710 --> 00:52:46.420
AUDIENCE: OMG.

00:52:46.420 --> 00:52:49.990
[LAUGHTER]

00:52:49.990 --> 00:52:51.830
AUDIENCE: I'm a big fan.

00:52:51.830 --> 00:52:55.400
I actually have started
my own food page.

00:52:55.400 --> 00:52:59.160
And I'm up every day,
visitor of your page.

00:52:59.160 --> 00:53:01.650
And that's when I came to
know that you'll be in Google,

00:53:01.650 --> 00:53:03.852
so I somehow tracked
down my friend

00:53:03.852 --> 00:53:05.560
that I really want to
come to the campus.

00:53:05.560 --> 00:53:08.440
And I really wanted
to come and see you.

00:53:08.440 --> 00:53:10.350
One question.

00:53:10.350 --> 00:53:14.267
I've sent you many messages
on Facebook, but haven't--

00:53:14.267 --> 00:53:15.758
[LAUGHTER]

00:53:15.758 --> 00:53:19.237
AUDIENCE: --had
any response yet.

00:53:19.237 --> 00:53:21.430
IRFAN DAMA: [INAUDIBLE]
that pressure.

00:53:21.430 --> 00:53:23.420
AUDIENCE: I sent you
a link of my page.

00:53:23.420 --> 00:53:25.160
Hey, what do you
think about my page?

00:53:25.160 --> 00:53:28.720
It's a food blog.

00:53:28.720 --> 00:53:29.810
No, no response.

00:53:29.810 --> 00:53:32.260
AUDIENCE: Awww.

00:53:32.260 --> 00:53:34.900
IRFAN DAMA: See, this
is why you should

00:53:34.900 --> 00:53:37.160
be married, because
my wife answers

00:53:37.160 --> 00:53:38.280
all my Facebook questions.

00:53:38.280 --> 00:53:39.280
[LAUGHTER]

00:53:39.280 --> 00:53:43.430
IRFAN DAMA: And she's
always on top of things.

00:53:43.430 --> 00:53:44.650
She's my publicist, so.

00:53:47.450 --> 00:53:48.430
VIKAS KHANNA: Hi.

00:53:48.430 --> 00:53:56.850
[LAUGHTER]

00:53:56.850 --> 00:53:57.850
VIKAS KHANNA: I'm sorry.

00:54:02.480 --> 00:54:03.850
AUDIENCE: Send again?

00:54:03.850 --> 00:54:06.550
VIKAS KHANNA: I'm not the
greatest person to click.

00:54:06.550 --> 00:54:07.762
My lady who does my--

00:54:07.762 --> 00:54:09.470
AUDIENCE: You should
blame the publicist.

00:54:09.470 --> 00:54:10.952
VIKAS KHANNA: Publicist.

00:54:10.952 --> 00:54:11.660
[INAUDIBLE] here.

00:54:15.780 --> 00:54:18.900
I'm just writing
a big encyclopedia

00:54:18.900 --> 00:54:22.620
of festive foods of India.

00:54:22.620 --> 00:54:26.660
And I start this journey
from Indus Valley,

00:54:26.660 --> 00:54:28.930
what festivals they
must be celebrating,

00:54:28.930 --> 00:54:33.200
and what foods they
must be eating.

00:54:33.200 --> 00:54:36.650
In Greek, Greek people or
Greeks, like what language,

00:54:36.650 --> 00:54:41.760
they say that artist
dies, art lives.

00:54:41.760 --> 00:54:43.950
I'm a [INAUDIBLE]
believer of that.

00:54:43.950 --> 00:54:46.070
Right now, and I'm
that story of Mirabai

00:54:46.070 --> 00:54:50.400
which we hold in the mythology,
who fell in love with Krishna.

00:54:50.400 --> 00:54:52.310
And she couldn't
see anything else.

00:54:52.310 --> 00:54:54.400
She could even have
consumed poison.

00:54:54.400 --> 00:54:58.230
But the love was so much
greater for something else.

00:54:58.230 --> 00:55:00.170
So what has happened
that I do have

00:55:00.170 --> 00:55:02.340
a lot of people who does
my social media, also.

00:55:02.340 --> 00:55:06.050
But I am the one who says
that today God has given me

00:55:06.050 --> 00:55:12.300
a voice, after being mute
and dumb for so many years.

00:55:12.300 --> 00:55:16.280
At this time, I must
discover more art.

00:55:16.280 --> 00:55:19.830
So in this space and time, I
will never become a shopkeeper,

00:55:19.830 --> 00:55:22.180
like I will never have
pickles coming out of my name

00:55:22.180 --> 00:55:22.910
with a smile.

00:55:22.910 --> 00:55:25.560
Nothing.

00:55:25.560 --> 00:55:28.480
I'm the slave of art.

00:55:28.480 --> 00:55:31.800
And that is what
all my energy goes.

00:55:31.800 --> 00:55:33.517
And I've apologized
in the middle of this

00:55:33.517 --> 00:55:34.600
if I'm ignoring something.

00:55:34.600 --> 00:55:34.980
AUDIENCE: You're not.

00:55:34.980 --> 00:55:36.620
VIKAS KHANNA: I'm
not, but I just

00:55:36.620 --> 00:55:41.300
feel that there's something
that-- how many people give

00:55:41.300 --> 00:55:44.910
an opportunity given that I
live in India and America both.

00:55:44.910 --> 00:55:46.952
In America, they don't
know that I live in India.

00:55:46.952 --> 00:55:48.951
And in India, they don't
know I live in America.

00:55:48.951 --> 00:55:51.520
So I think this whole confusion
of time lapse, my whole life

00:55:51.520 --> 00:55:53.281
is like in different space.

00:55:53.281 --> 00:55:55.614
AUDIENCE: No, we have full
tab on when you're in America

00:55:55.614 --> 00:55:57.051
and when you're in India.

00:55:57.051 --> 00:56:00.883
[LAUGHTER]

00:56:00.883 --> 00:56:02.624
IRFAN DAMA: Wonderful.

00:56:02.624 --> 00:56:04.540
VIKAS KHANNA: Can I cook
for you to apologize?

00:56:04.540 --> 00:56:06.220
[LAUGHTER]

00:56:06.220 --> 00:56:07.750
AUDIENCE: Yes, do, yes.

00:56:07.750 --> 00:56:09.176
IRFAN DAMA: Wow.

00:56:09.176 --> 00:56:10.550
AUDIENCE: Can you
get jimbu here?

00:56:10.550 --> 00:56:12.341
You mentioned it's such
a great alternative

00:56:12.341 --> 00:56:15.110
to cumin-based tempering.

00:56:15.110 --> 00:56:17.067
Jumbu, as we call
in Uttarakhand.

00:56:17.067 --> 00:56:18.900
VIKAS KHANNA: Oh my
god, where are you from?

00:56:18.900 --> 00:56:20.630
AUDIENCE: Uttarakhand
which is Kumaun, and--

00:56:20.630 --> 00:56:21.546
VIKAS KHANNA: Wowwwww!

00:56:21.546 --> 00:56:23.520
I paid my money, he says right.

00:56:23.520 --> 00:56:24.979
Somebody I figured
out I was right.

00:56:24.979 --> 00:56:27.228
AUDIENCE: So I think what
is there is quite authentic.

00:56:27.228 --> 00:56:29.760
Like, I think it's gone to
Nepal as well as Uttarakhand.

00:56:29.760 --> 00:56:30.870
So can you get it?

00:56:30.870 --> 00:56:33.116
Right now, my only way
is to smuggle it through,

00:56:33.116 --> 00:56:34.490
like get it from
India basically.

00:56:34.490 --> 00:56:35.450
VIKAS KHANNA: Yeah.

00:56:35.450 --> 00:56:36.750
That's what I suggest too.

00:56:36.750 --> 00:56:37.819
IRFAN DAMA: Smuggle it.

00:56:37.819 --> 00:56:38.860
VIKAS KHANNA: Smuggle it.

00:56:38.860 --> 00:56:40.609
Hey, you know, every
time I'm coming back,

00:56:40.609 --> 00:56:42.530
and I'm at the airport.

00:56:42.530 --> 00:56:45.250
And I'm just getting
into the Customs,

00:56:45.250 --> 00:56:47.840
and the guy says, you're the
same guy from Gordon Ramsay,

00:56:47.840 --> 00:56:48.340
right?

00:56:48.340 --> 00:56:49.260
I said, yeah.

00:56:49.260 --> 00:56:51.020
Are you getting in some spices?

00:56:51.020 --> 00:56:51.560
I said yes.

00:56:51.560 --> 00:56:52.400
He said OK, go.

00:56:52.400 --> 00:56:53.066
IRFAN DAMA: Wow!

00:56:55.790 --> 00:56:59.270
VIKAS KHANNA: But the only thing
I do is I steal and I bring.

00:56:59.270 --> 00:57:00.960
Anybody recording, also?

00:57:00.960 --> 00:57:01.740
It's OK.

00:57:01.740 --> 00:57:02.885
IRFAN DAMA: It's OK.

00:57:02.885 --> 00:57:04.010
VIKAS KHANNA: Love is love.

00:57:04.010 --> 00:57:07.110
But jimbu is a very
unique herb, which

00:57:07.110 --> 00:57:08.860
is used in Uttarakhand
cuisine and it's

00:57:08.860 --> 00:57:10.270
used in Nepalese cuisine.

00:57:10.270 --> 00:57:14.010
One thing which is unique
is that it is so delicate

00:57:14.010 --> 00:57:17.030
that what you do is
that you heat the oil,

00:57:17.030 --> 00:57:18.750
not totally burn it.

00:57:18.750 --> 00:57:20.000
You add jimbo.

00:57:20.000 --> 00:57:23.080
Instantly, you add
it over lentils.

00:57:23.080 --> 00:57:25.990
It's such a fragrant,
holistic smell.

00:57:25.990 --> 00:57:29.270
It's only used in lentils,
in Uttarakhand and in Nepal.

00:57:29.270 --> 00:57:32.770
But if you would ever
make a journey to Mustang,

00:57:32.770 --> 00:57:36.800
in northeast of Nepal, where
they-- you must Google this.

00:57:36.800 --> 00:57:38.864
Google is free for
you guys anyway.

00:57:38.864 --> 00:57:39.810
[LAUGHTER]

00:57:39.810 --> 00:57:41.560
VIKAS KHANNA: Mustang,
this is the place

00:57:41.560 --> 00:57:45.600
where they found about 1,500
years old caves of Buddha.

00:57:45.600 --> 00:57:50.240
They use jimbu in making
meat and in preserving meat.

00:57:50.240 --> 00:57:51.840
I was like wow!

00:57:51.840 --> 00:57:55.300
How do I smuggle this.

00:57:55.300 --> 00:57:56.277
But you're right.

00:57:56.277 --> 00:57:58.360
Some things are very
difficult when you talk about

00:57:58.360 --> 00:58:01.060
substitutions, , because
you don't want to destroy

00:58:01.060 --> 00:58:02.410
the beauty of it.

00:58:02.410 --> 00:58:04.460
So I put the jimbu--
call it jimbu.

00:58:04.460 --> 00:58:06.617
A lot of people say,
it's not "Hi- MAL-yan,"

00:58:06.617 --> 00:58:07.450
it's "hi ma LAY an."

00:58:07.450 --> 00:58:08.516
I said no!

00:58:08.516 --> 00:58:09.390
It's a Sanskrit word.

00:58:09.390 --> 00:58:13.514
At least for one time in my
life, I'm right [INAUDIBLE].

00:58:13.514 --> 00:58:14.430
IRFAN DAMA: All right.

00:58:14.430 --> 00:58:16.140
Well, thank you
everyone for coming.

00:58:16.140 --> 00:58:16.420
And Vikas--

00:58:16.420 --> 00:58:17.378
VIKAS KHANNA: Likewise.

00:58:17.378 --> 00:58:19.630
IRFAN DAMA: Thank you
so much for coming here.
