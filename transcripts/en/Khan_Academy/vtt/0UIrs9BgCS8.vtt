00:00:01.520 --> 00:00:03.740
Anna wants to
celebrate her birthday

00:00:03.740 --> 00:00:06.100
by eating pizza
with her friends.

00:00:06.100 --> 00:00:11.410
p boxes of pizza cost $40 total.

00:00:11.410 --> 00:00:14.710
Each box of pizza costs $8.

00:00:14.710 --> 00:00:18.664
Select all equations that
describe this situation.

00:00:18.664 --> 00:00:20.080
So before I even
look at that, let

00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:22.810
me at least try to construct
one in my own brain.

00:00:22.810 --> 00:00:28.660
So p boxes of pizza cost $40,
each box of pizza cost $8.

00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:30.035
So one way that
I could say, what

00:00:30.035 --> 00:00:33.390
would be the total cost
of pizzas in terms of p?

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:35.830
Well it's going to be
the number of boxes

00:00:35.830 --> 00:00:38.800
that I get times
the cost per box.

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:43.440
So it's going to be
p times 8, or 8p.

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:45.930
And the other way of
saying that, the total cost

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:50.140
of my box of my pizzas, 8p,
or I could say it's $40.

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:53.050
So 8p must be equal to $40.

00:00:53.050 --> 00:00:56.650
And we have that captured right
here, in this first equation.

00:00:56.650 --> 00:01:00.030
The number of pizza boxes is
p, you multiply that times 8,

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:01.890
because it's $8 per box.

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:05.220
That's my total cost
of boxes, which I also

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:06.480
know is going to be $40.

00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:09.345
So these two things must
be equal to each other.

00:01:09.345 --> 00:01:11.670
Now anything else
that I select really

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:14.510
has to be the same thing
as this first equation,

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:16.350
just manipulated a little bit.

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:20.380
So over here I have
40 divided by 8 is p.

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:22.600
So there's a couple of
ways to think about it.

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:26.980
If I take the total amount
that I spend on pizza, $40,

00:01:26.980 --> 00:01:32.370
and I divide by the cost per
box, so if I divide by 8,

00:01:32.370 --> 00:01:34.160
that should give me
the number of boxes.

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:35.451
And that's what this is saying.

00:01:35.451 --> 00:01:38.350
Take my total cost,
divide by my cost per box,

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:40.430
and it should give me
the number of boxes.

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:42.240
Another way of
thinking about it is,

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:43.865
if you take both
sides of this equation

00:01:43.865 --> 00:01:47.370
and divide both sides by
8, on the left-hand side

00:01:47.370 --> 00:01:50.280
8p divided by 8 is p.

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:52.170
And on the right-hand
side, 40 divided by 8

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:53.830
is, well, 40 divided by 8.

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:56.960
It doesn't matter if we wrote
p equals 40 divided by 8 or 40

00:01:56.960 --> 00:01:58.521
divided by 8 is equal to p.

00:01:58.521 --> 00:02:01.020
They're just saying that both
of these quantities are equal.

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:04.890
So this is also another way
to describe the situation.

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:07.500
Now let's think about
this right over here.

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:11.670
8 divided by 40 is equal to p.

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:14.710
Well this is not consistent,
either with this statement,

00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:16.890
or with some of the other
things that we checked.

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:19.490
Where on the left-hand side
we're taking the reciprocal,

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:21.290
and on the right-hand
side we aren't.

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:24.660
So these two things
cannot be equivalent.

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:27.540
Over here we have 40
divided by p is equal to 8.

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:31.330
So if I just said, hey
look, I spent $40 on pizza,

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:34.730
and I bought p boxes, how much
did each of those boxes cost?

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:38.070
I would say well, I would take
40 divided by p to figure out

00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:39.810
how much each of
those boxes cost.

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:41.830
And they tell us to
that must be equal to 8,

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:43.590
that each box equals 8.

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:46.350
So this seems consistent
with what we just read.

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:49.175
And you can algebraically
manipulate any of these top two

00:02:49.175 --> 00:02:51.460
to get to this one
right over here.

00:02:51.460 --> 00:02:55.030
Right up here, if you
divide both sides by p,

00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:56.520
on the left-hand
side you have 8p

00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:58.660
divided by p, which would be 8.

00:02:58.660 --> 00:03:01.390
And on the right-hand side
40 divided by p is just 40

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:02.220
divided by p.

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:04.450
So it's the same exact thing.

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:09.500
And the last one, you have
p is equal to 8 times 40.

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:12.470
Well we already know that p
is equal to 40 divided by 8.

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:14.820
So it's definitely not
going to be 8 times 40.

00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:17.210
So that one does not apply.

00:03:17.210 --> 00:03:18.520
So let's check our answer.

00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:19.340
We got it right.

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:22.100
Let's do a couple more.

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:24.780
Molly and Tory like to
eat ice cream sandwiches.

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:27.270
Molly ate 5 ice cream
sandwiches and Tory

00:03:27.270 --> 00:03:29.880
ate n ice cream
sandwiches in one week.

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:32.730
They ate a total of 12 ice
cream sandwiches together.

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:34.760
Select all of the
equations that accurately

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:35.890
describe the situation.

00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:38.260
So Molly ate 5, Tory ate n.

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:41.180
So 5 plus n is the
total that they ate.

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:43.187
And they tell us that
that must be equal to 12,

00:03:43.187 --> 00:03:45.020
that the total that
they ate together is 12.

00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:47.110
So 5 plus n is 12.

00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:49.962
So we immediately see
that one right over there.

00:03:49.962 --> 00:03:51.420
Now anything else
that we check has

00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:53.930
to be consistent with 5
plus n is equal to 12.

00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:56.480
Or it has to be a way to
algebraically manipulate

00:03:56.480 --> 00:03:58.170
from this to anything
else that is true.

00:03:58.170 --> 00:04:00.040
So let's go one by one.

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:03.480
So is n minus 5 equal to 12?

00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:05.990
So n minus 5 is going to be
the difference between what

00:04:05.990 --> 00:04:07.300
Tory ate and Molly ate.

00:04:07.300 --> 00:04:08.550
And that's not going to be 12.

00:04:08.550 --> 00:04:11.030
Their sum is 12, so we're
not going to check that.

00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:12.829
Here we have 12 is
equal to n minus 5,

00:04:12.829 --> 00:04:15.120
which is an equivalent
statement to this top one, which

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:16.286
we already know is not true.

00:04:16.286 --> 00:04:18.610
All they did was swap both
sides of these equalities.

00:04:18.610 --> 00:04:20.350
So that's not true.

00:04:20.350 --> 00:04:22.300
5 minus n is equal to 12.

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:24.837
Well that's just the difference
between Molly and Tory.

00:04:24.837 --> 00:04:26.920
And that's definitely not
going to be equal to 12.

00:04:26.920 --> 00:04:33.940
The sum of the two is
going to be equal to 12.

00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:36.320
And then finally, well
we know this is right.

00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:40.570
And then this right over
here, n plus 5 and 5--

00:04:40.570 --> 00:04:42.530
We already know that 5
plus n is equal to 12.

00:04:42.530 --> 00:04:44.350
Well it's a completely
equivalent statement

00:04:44.350 --> 00:04:45.850
to say that 12 is
equal to n plus 5.

00:04:45.850 --> 00:04:47.975
You're just swapping the
left- and right-hand sides

00:04:47.975 --> 00:04:49.420
of the equality.

00:04:49.420 --> 00:04:50.590
So let's check our answer.

00:04:50.590 --> 00:04:52.940
Let's do one more.

00:04:52.940 --> 00:04:56.430
Mr. Herman's class is selling
candy for a school fundraiser.

00:04:56.430 --> 00:05:01.920
The class has a
goal of raising $500

00:05:01.920 --> 00:05:07.010
by selling c boxes
of candy for $2 each.

00:05:07.010 --> 00:05:09.050
Write an equation
that the students

00:05:09.050 --> 00:05:11.270
could solve to figure out
how many boxes of candy

00:05:11.270 --> 00:05:13.160
they need to sell.

00:05:13.160 --> 00:05:15.770
So let's think
about in terms of c,

00:05:15.770 --> 00:05:17.950
how much money they would raise.

00:05:17.950 --> 00:05:20.910
So let's say they sell c boxes.

00:05:20.910 --> 00:05:22.640
For each box, they get $2.

00:05:22.640 --> 00:05:25.280
So the total amount they're
going to get is 2 times c,

00:05:25.280 --> 00:05:27.924
or we can even just write
2c right over there.

00:05:27.924 --> 00:05:29.590
So this is the total
amount that they're

00:05:29.590 --> 00:05:31.080
going to raise in terms of c.

00:05:31.080 --> 00:05:34.050
Now we know that the
goal is to raise $500.

00:05:34.050 --> 00:05:38.430
So we want to figure out what c
does the total amount that they

00:05:38.430 --> 00:05:41.830
raise, does that equal 500?

00:05:41.830 --> 00:05:43.420
So this right here
is the equation

00:05:43.420 --> 00:05:45.211
that the students could
solve to figure out

00:05:45.211 --> 00:05:46.980
how many boxes of candy
they need to sell.

00:05:46.980 --> 00:05:48.390
Let me check our answer.

00:05:48.390 --> 00:05:49.920
And of course to
solve this, we're

00:05:49.920 --> 00:05:52.044
essentially saying 2
times c is equal to 500.

00:05:52.044 --> 00:05:53.960
So you might be able to
solve it in your head.

00:05:53.960 --> 00:05:55.940
You might say 2
times what is 500?

00:05:55.940 --> 00:05:57.490
And you would get 250.

00:05:57.490 --> 00:06:00.080
Or if you wanted to solve it a
little bit more systematically,

00:06:00.080 --> 00:06:02.240
you just divide both sides by 2.

00:06:02.240 --> 00:06:04.030
2c divided by 2 is c.

00:06:04.030 --> 00:06:05.800
500 divided by 2 is 250.

00:06:05.800 --> 00:06:08.900
And you would get
c is equal to 250.
