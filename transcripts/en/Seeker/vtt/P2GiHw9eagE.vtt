00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:05.259
Advancing particle physics demands we build
bigger and badder particle accelerators, but

00:00:05.259 --> 00:00:09.610
every time the conversation about the next
ultra-mega-super collider comes up some stick

00:00:09.610 --> 00:00:14.220
in the mud announces that it could kill us
and the whole universe…

00:00:14.220 --> 00:00:15.220
But will it?

00:00:15.220 --> 00:00:18.240
You probably fall into one or two camps on
this subject.

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:21.920
Either you’re like me and you think that
smashing some protons into each other head

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:26.929
on at near light speed is just going to create
some pretty pictures and obliterated protons,

00:00:26.929 --> 00:00:30.869
or you think it’ll create some pretty pictures
and obliterate the Earth.

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:35.550
But the quantum world is weird and unintuitive,
so let’s all put our assumptions aside for

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:40.750
one second and genuinely examine the supposed
ways CERN could kill us all.

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:45.620
One of the stranger ideas revolves around
strange matter called strangelets.

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:50.080
Strangelets are hypothetical forms of matter
made up of up, down, and strange quarks.

00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:53.350
They’re structure would make them more stable
than ordinary nuclei.

00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:57.901
In the right conditions, they could, hypothetically,
rearrange ordinary matter, converting it to

00:00:57.901 --> 00:01:03.240
be like itself,* causing a runaway chain reaction
that shrinks earth down to a 100 meter wide

00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:04.780
ball of strangeness.

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:06.510
A space oddity.

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:10.180
It’s like the subatomic version of ice-nine.

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:13.150
And if you don’t know what ice-nine is,
read cat’s cradle.

00:01:13.150 --> 00:01:15.320
Vonnegut is an American treasure.

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:19.320
Strangelets were a concern when the world’s
second most powerful particle accelerator,

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:24.820
the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider in the
US, was switched on in the year 2000 so far

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:26.120
there’s still no sign of them.

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:27.720
So that’s encouraging.

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:32.540
Then of course there’s the fear that just
won’t go away, the idea that particle colliders

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:35.950
will create a black hole that swallows the
Earth.

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:39.550
Well guess what, there’s some truth to this
idea.

00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:43.360
But a teeeeeeny tiny one.

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:47.540
Physicists have theorized the existence of
micro black holes, but they’d be pretty

00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:48.570
unimpressive.

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:52.120
First you have to remember that a black hole’s
gravity depends on its mass.

00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:56.369
If the Earth were suddenly compacted down
to just nine millimeters across, small enough

00:01:56.369 --> 00:02:00.420
to become a black hole, the moon’s orbit
wouldn’t change.

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:03.900
Black hole Earth has the same gravitational
pull as vanilla Earth.

00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:08.560
So a ultra-small black hole wouldn’t be
able to suck much in, and it would take three

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:12.750
trillion years for it to reach the mass of
one kilogram.

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:15.390
But the black hole doesn’t have that much
time.

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:20.010
Stephen Hawking theorized that black holes
decay and give off Hawking radiation.

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:24.230
Even making the most generous assumptions
possible, a micro black hole would exist for

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:27.590
all of 10-23 seconds.

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:32.530
So even if a particle accelerator could create
black holes, they pose no threat whatsoever.

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:37.440
Finally, it’s been suggested that particle
accelerators might not just be the end of

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:40.010
Earth but the entire universe.

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:45.239
The idea is called Vacuum Decay, which postulates
that the vacuum our universe exists in is

00:02:45.239 --> 00:02:49.810
in a metastable state, meaning it seems like
it’s in a stable state, but something could

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:53.480
disrupt it and drop it to a lower, more stable
energy state.

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:58.220
If that happens it could create a bubble of
the new stable vacuum that spreads across

00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:03.540
the universe at light speed, wiping out literally
everything, right down to the fundamental

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:05.240
laws of physics.

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:09.500
Some researchers suggest a particle accelerator
could be the thing that tips our nice safe

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:15.050
false vacuum over the edge, maybe even by
way of micro black holes, so double whammy!

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:17.599
But I wouldn’t worry about it too much.

00:03:17.599 --> 00:03:22.330
Actually a good argument against any collider-caused
doomsday scenario is all around us.

00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:26.519
While smashing particles is an impressive
feat for humans, it’s pretty humdrum for

00:03:26.519 --> 00:03:27.519
the universe.

00:03:27.519 --> 00:03:31.870
Millions of collisions releasing more energy
than any particle accelerator happen daily,

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:35.690
just above our heads as cosmic rays collide
in our atmosphere.

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:40.709
The moon has been bombarded with cosmic rays
for billions of years and it’s still there.

00:03:40.709 --> 00:03:45.379
If strangelets or micro black holes or vacuum
decay were to kill us all, it probably would

00:03:45.379 --> 00:03:46.650
have happened by now.

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:50.489
Smashing some protons here on Earth and destroying
the universe is kind of like plugging in your

00:03:50.489 --> 00:03:53.220
night light and causing a countrywide blackout.

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:57.100
So there’s no reason not to keep pushing
the limits of particle accelerators.

00:03:57.100 --> 00:04:02.230
In fact, doing so could reveal new physics
that would show our vacuum is stable and strangelets

00:04:02.230 --> 00:04:04.221
can’t exist and everything is A-OK.

00:04:04.221 --> 00:04:05.221
Or maybe vacuum decay already started in some
other part of the universe and it’s on it’s

00:04:05.221 --> 00:04:06.221
way here to kill us right now.

00:04:06.221 --> 00:04:07.221
We can’t know, what are you going to spend
your whole life worrying?

00:04:07.221 --> 00:04:09.140
So particle colliders won’t kill you, and
you know what else shouldn’t?

00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:10.159
