00:00:01.137 --> 00:00:02.220
ARTUR OLIVEIRA: All right.

00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:03.480
Good afternoon, everyone.

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:06.260
Thank you all very much for
coming down to the Talks event

00:00:06.260 --> 00:00:06.770
today.

00:00:06.770 --> 00:00:08.920
My name is art Artur Oliveira.

00:00:08.920 --> 00:00:12.660
I'm one of the Chicago site
leads for Talks at Google

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:13.950
here in Chicago.

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:16.340
I'm very excited
about this talk today.

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:19.970
I am going to let John Michael
Schert do his own introduction

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:21.750
because I just
couldn't do it justice.

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:23.930
But what I'm especially
excited about today

00:00:23.930 --> 00:00:27.460
is this is a great opportunity
to really interact with him.

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:30.170
We have a small room but
a really good audience.

00:00:30.170 --> 00:00:32.509
So, you know, he's
going to get started.

00:00:32.509 --> 00:00:36.380
He has tons of interesting
content to share with you

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:37.380
and talk with you about.

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:39.620
But by all means,
like, don't feel

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:41.910
shy about asking questions,
jumping in, commenting,

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:43.090
and all of that.

00:00:43.090 --> 00:00:45.690
It's a really good opportunity
that we have today.

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:47.731
So without further ado,
I'm going to turn it over

00:00:47.731 --> 00:00:48.430
to John Michael.

00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:49.596
JOHN MICHAEL SCHERT: Thanks.

00:00:49.596 --> 00:00:50.305
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:50.305 --> 00:00:51.456
Oh, applause.

00:00:51.456 --> 00:00:52.580
They're applauding already.

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:53.710
I've done nothing.

00:00:53.710 --> 00:00:55.240
But thank you.

00:00:55.240 --> 00:00:57.640
So I do have two first
names, John and Michael.

00:00:57.640 --> 00:01:00.230
My mom gave me
that lifelong task.

00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:02.180
I grew up in South Georgia.

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:04.930
And like most warm-blooded
American boys,

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:08.334
I started doing "The
Nutcracker" at the age of 6,

00:01:08.334 --> 00:01:10.250
which led to, like, a
pretty interesting life.

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:13.420
So I've been a ballet dancer
now since 6 years old.

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:16.400
I've professionally been a
ballet dancer for 16 years.

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:18.650
According to Malcolm
Gladwell, I am an expert.

00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:20.590
I have put in my 45,000 hours.

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:22.440
I have done, by
my last estimate,

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:26.630
over 300,000 plies,
which is just this

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:29.520
over and over and over again.

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:34.190
So ballet, like most any other
form, is highly rigorous.

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:37.170
You can compare it to
any other athletic sport.

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:38.970
You can compare it,
though, to learning

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:42.730
any skill, whether it's
a language, coding, most

00:01:42.730 --> 00:01:43.260
anything.

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:46.270
We spend hundreds of thousands
of hours figuring out

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:49.420
the difference
between this and this.

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:53.330
That took about 10,000 hours
just to get that right.

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:56.490
So like most rigorous
forms, when you're young,

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:58.880
you're really just focusing
on the form itself.

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:00.290
It's a derivative
process, right?

00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:02.700
Like, you're being given this
knowledge by your teachers.

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:04.658
And they're saying, you
need to do it this way.

00:02:04.658 --> 00:02:06.610
And if you don't,
you don't measure up.

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:08.270
You're not good enough.

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:10.590
And so you're always
trying to find this more

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:13.380
extrinsically-- a
way you're filtering

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:15.380
this extrinsic information.

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:17.120
It takes a long time
before you start

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:19.100
to get that intrinsic
of, like, do you

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:20.920
know the difference
between this and this?

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:23.160
It takes a long time before
you can really feel it.

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:24.250
We do repetition.

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:27.250
We're doing the same thing
over and over and over and over

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:27.875
again.

00:02:27.875 --> 00:02:30.000
So I moved away from home
at 14 to go to a boarding

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:30.920
school for ballet.

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:34.510
At 18 I moved to New York and
joined American Ballet Theatre,

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:37.747
which is considered--
it's like joining Google.

00:02:37.747 --> 00:02:38.580
It's one of the top.

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:40.829
It's one of the top five
ballet companies in the world

00:02:40.829 --> 00:02:42.240
for classical ballet.

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:46.110
It is a very, I would say,
quantitative ballet company.

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:47.970
Again, more is more.

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:50.590
You can measure who is better.

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:53.260
Five pirouettes is
better than four.

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:55.536
The way a foot
looks-- my parents

00:02:55.536 --> 00:02:56.910
gave me good
genetics for ballet.

00:02:56.910 --> 00:02:58.660
So my feet do what
they're supposed to do.

00:02:58.660 --> 00:03:00.020
My proportions are right.

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:01.830
In some ways, I
didn't have to work

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:03.640
as hard as some of
my peers because I

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:05.620
had a lot of aptitude.

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:07.589
The way a foot looks,
the way a leg works,

00:03:07.589 --> 00:03:09.880
how high your leg goes--
those are all ways that you're

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:11.550
evaluated and measured.

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:15.180
ABT, American Ballet Theatre,
is a very hierarchical system.

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:19.790
So I went to the summer
program at the age of 16.

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:22.850
And I met a group of
colleagues-- my cohort.

00:03:22.850 --> 00:03:24.770
We all joined the same day.

00:03:24.770 --> 00:03:28.040
And to this day, still one of
my favorite people in the world

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:29.700
is my good friend
Misty Copeland.

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:32.390
So we all joined the
same day, age 15.

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:35.530
At age 18, we all became
members of the Studio Company,

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:36.890
which is like the young bucks.

00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:37.925
Then we became trainees.

00:03:37.925 --> 00:03:39.050
Then we became apprentices.

00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:41.010
Then we became corps
de ballet members.

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:42.270
And then she became a soloist.

00:03:42.270 --> 00:03:46.450
And now she's a principal dancer
and the face of Under Armour.

00:03:46.450 --> 00:03:48.560
The way you get
promoted was very much

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:50.710
based on how do you measure up.

00:03:50.710 --> 00:03:52.930
So again, I'm going
to call this the form.

00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:54.260
You had to excel at the form.

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:56.790
You had to excel at how
you processed and applied

00:03:56.790 --> 00:03:58.380
extrinsic information.

00:03:58.380 --> 00:04:00.240
You had to think quantitatively.

00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:06.800
You had to understand the
objective nature of ballet,

00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:08.700
more than the subjective.

00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:11.274
Most people think
dancers are artists.

00:04:11.274 --> 00:04:12.440
Most dancers aren't artists.

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:13.280
They're technicians.

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:15.749
They're very good at
applying all this information

00:04:15.749 --> 00:04:16.790
and doing it brilliantly.

00:04:20.130 --> 00:04:21.529
That wasn't enough for me.

00:04:21.529 --> 00:04:23.720
So after only a
couple years at ABT,

00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:27.120
I left to join a company that
was starting in New York called

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:29.510
Cedar Lake Contemporary Ballet.

00:04:29.510 --> 00:04:32.480
It was well known because it
was-- most dance companies are

00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:33.100
nonprofit.

00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:34.380
So they're funded by
a variety of sources.

00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:35.588
This was funded by one woman.

00:04:35.588 --> 00:04:37.040
Her name's Nancy Walton Laurie.

00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:38.415
She's a Walmart heiress.

00:04:38.415 --> 00:04:39.790
I remember, on
the first day, she

00:04:39.790 --> 00:04:43.310
walked in with her floor-length
purple mink coat and said,

00:04:43.310 --> 00:04:44.305
I own a baseball team.

00:04:44.305 --> 00:04:45.400
I own a hockey team.

00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:48.140
I own championship
horses, and I own you.

00:04:48.140 --> 00:04:51.010
I was only there
for three months.

00:04:51.010 --> 00:04:54.940
But I met a man, Alonzo
King, who became really sort

00:04:54.940 --> 00:04:57.470
of my mentor, a guru, almost.

00:04:57.470 --> 00:05:00.366
So I moved to San Francisco
and tutored-- well,

00:05:00.366 --> 00:05:01.240
I was in the company.

00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:03.910
But really, I was a
mentee to this man.

00:05:03.910 --> 00:05:07.250
So Alonzo was the
first one to teach me

00:05:07.250 --> 00:05:10.520
the balance of what I'm going to
talk about today-- the balance

00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:12.330
of the creative process.

00:05:12.330 --> 00:05:14.270
So the creative
process is not just

00:05:14.270 --> 00:05:16.860
all being in the right
brain all the time

00:05:16.860 --> 00:05:19.040
and being in this
incredible gaseous state.

00:05:19.040 --> 00:05:20.530
Has anyone read
Steven Johnson's,

00:05:20.530 --> 00:05:21.930
"Where Good Ideas Come From"?

00:05:21.930 --> 00:05:24.320
He talks about gaseous states.

00:05:24.320 --> 00:05:26.150
They don't have as much form.

00:05:26.150 --> 00:05:27.950
A great idea and
information can come.

00:05:27.950 --> 00:05:30.380
It can flow a little
easier, compared

00:05:30.380 --> 00:05:32.130
to, like, a solid-state
environment, which

00:05:32.130 --> 00:05:34.620
was where I was coming from,
American Ballet Theatre.

00:05:34.620 --> 00:05:37.340
I'm going to give the analogy
of two feet firmly planted.

00:05:37.340 --> 00:05:40.010
That was ABT, like,
very much grounded.

00:05:40.010 --> 00:05:44.250
A gaseous state, of course, is
just like everything's moving.

00:05:44.250 --> 00:05:45.340
Everything's formless.

00:05:45.340 --> 00:05:48.000
It's all about the feeling,
where ABT was all about

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:49.890
the form-- so form and feeling.

00:05:49.890 --> 00:05:53.210
Gaseous states are much more,
like, intrinsically motivated.

00:05:53.210 --> 00:05:54.170
What are you thinking?

00:05:54.170 --> 00:05:55.540
How does this make you feel?

00:05:55.540 --> 00:05:56.956
Where are you going
to go with it?

00:05:56.956 --> 00:05:59.490
Most people think artists are
constantly just in this state,

00:05:59.490 --> 00:06:03.580
right, where again, a
form-based, quantitative system

00:06:03.580 --> 00:06:05.570
is much more, what
can you measure,

00:06:05.570 --> 00:06:08.910
and what is being told to you,
and how are you replicating it?

00:06:08.910 --> 00:06:11.800
Alonzo was the first
one to really teach me

00:06:11.800 --> 00:06:14.230
the creative process
is how you find

00:06:14.230 --> 00:06:21.160
this inner dialogue of form and
feeling, objective perspective,

00:06:21.160 --> 00:06:23.740
subjective understanding.

00:06:23.740 --> 00:06:26.740
How are you listening
while telling?

00:06:26.740 --> 00:06:29.130
How are you doing
the choreography

00:06:29.130 --> 00:06:30.710
and doing it with
great articulation

00:06:30.710 --> 00:06:33.270
and great, like,
acumen and skill,

00:06:33.270 --> 00:06:35.354
using all that ability
that you've been working on

00:06:35.354 --> 00:06:37.395
for all those years to
make sure your thumb's not

00:06:37.395 --> 00:06:38.400
like that but like that?

00:06:38.400 --> 00:06:40.420
But how are you, in
the act of telling--

00:06:40.420 --> 00:06:43.280
like, I'm going to do the step
for you-- how are you also

00:06:43.280 --> 00:06:46.150
having a state of
reciprocal listening,

00:06:46.150 --> 00:06:49.060
where you're opening
yourself up to possibility?

00:06:49.060 --> 00:06:51.040
So you're not improvving.

00:06:51.040 --> 00:06:52.850
You're not making
these steps up.

00:06:52.850 --> 00:06:53.840
But it feels alive.

00:06:53.840 --> 00:06:55.280
It feels spontaneous.

00:06:55.280 --> 00:06:56.750
It feels real in this moment.

00:06:56.750 --> 00:06:59.380
Alonzo would always say, I
don't want to see the steps.

00:06:59.380 --> 00:07:02.200
I want to see the ideas, right?

00:07:02.200 --> 00:07:04.310
So he's like, I don't
want to go on stage

00:07:04.310 --> 00:07:06.390
and just see you
doing arithmetic.

00:07:06.390 --> 00:07:09.260
Then the arm does this, and
then you do that, where at ABT,

00:07:09.260 --> 00:07:10.600
that's what they valued.

00:07:10.600 --> 00:07:12.710
No, your arm should
be here, not here.

00:07:12.710 --> 00:07:15.570
You know, it's all about
placement, specificity.

00:07:15.570 --> 00:07:17.990
But Alonzo would
say, I'm just going

00:07:17.990 --> 00:07:21.840
to assume that you're
a genius, right?

00:07:21.840 --> 00:07:24.340
Like, he's like, why should
I spend our time together

00:07:24.340 --> 00:07:26.640
working on that?

00:07:26.640 --> 00:07:28.250
That's your job.

00:07:28.250 --> 00:07:31.240
That's what you've been spending
your whole life working on.

00:07:31.240 --> 00:07:33.100
Why should we work
on that together?

00:07:33.100 --> 00:07:35.040
I want to work on the ideas.

00:07:35.040 --> 00:07:38.576
So one way that I think of this
is in a transactional system,

00:07:38.576 --> 00:07:40.200
it's like, here's
where you need to be.

00:07:40.200 --> 00:07:41.491
And this is how you measure up.

00:07:41.491 --> 00:07:43.030
And then you match it, right?

00:07:43.030 --> 00:07:44.760
And you find the
right frequency.

00:07:44.760 --> 00:07:48.320
Alonzo, for me, was saying,
here's where I want you to be.

00:07:48.320 --> 00:07:50.470
And you have to match it.

00:07:50.470 --> 00:07:54.680
Within that has to be
a sustainable rise.

00:07:54.680 --> 00:07:56.980
The form-- this
axis-- has to still

00:07:56.980 --> 00:07:59.330
be based in the form
and the technique

00:07:59.330 --> 00:08:01.710
and the data and
the information.

00:08:01.710 --> 00:08:04.390
But how you get
to that rise equal

00:08:04.390 --> 00:08:06.370
parts the intrinsic,
the subjective,

00:08:06.370 --> 00:08:08.172
and what you're
bringing to the step.

00:08:08.172 --> 00:08:09.880
So I'm going to say
the same thing to you

00:08:09.880 --> 00:08:11.150
today that Alonzo said to me.

00:08:11.150 --> 00:08:13.570
I'm just going to assume that
you all are genius, right?

00:08:13.570 --> 00:08:15.030
You're here.

00:08:15.030 --> 00:08:17.120
You work for this company.

00:08:17.120 --> 00:08:19.660
You're very good at what you do.

00:08:19.660 --> 00:08:21.910
So the gist of today's
talk, "The Utility

00:08:21.910 --> 00:08:24.760
of the Creative
Process," is not just

00:08:24.760 --> 00:08:27.230
how are you exercising
mastery in terms

00:08:27.230 --> 00:08:31.700
of how you execute or implement
or even continue growing,

00:08:31.700 --> 00:08:36.669
but how are you tapping into
that next level of what's

00:08:36.669 --> 00:08:37.390
possible?

00:08:37.390 --> 00:08:40.510
So I always like to joke that
creativity is 2/3 reality,

00:08:40.510 --> 00:08:42.699
1/3 possibility, right?

00:08:42.699 --> 00:08:44.240
Now, if you're in
this gaseous state,

00:08:44.240 --> 00:08:46.700
it's like 3/3 possibility.

00:08:46.700 --> 00:08:51.580
But if you're over here in the
solid state, it's 3/3 reality.

00:08:51.580 --> 00:08:55.110
You need to be in a
fluid, agile state.

00:08:55.110 --> 00:08:58.510
Again, to quote Steven
Johnson, "fluid systems."

00:08:58.510 --> 00:09:01.170
The way I think of it is one
foot planted in the ground.

00:09:01.170 --> 00:09:04.560
This is the technique, your
training, your knowledge,

00:09:04.560 --> 00:09:08.650
your inheritance, tradition,
assets, resources-- everything

00:09:08.650 --> 00:09:10.300
that you can measure.

00:09:10.300 --> 00:09:12.390
But with this other
foot, you want

00:09:12.390 --> 00:09:14.880
to be constantly
challenging yourself

00:09:14.880 --> 00:09:19.800
to be finding and seeking,
going into the unknown, right?

00:09:19.800 --> 00:09:23.040
So the Venn diagram of, like,
the known and the unknown,

00:09:23.040 --> 00:09:24.850
it's that thin layer of overlap.

00:09:24.850 --> 00:09:27.030
That's where possibility lies.

00:09:27.030 --> 00:09:29.311
That's where, quote,
unquote, "innovation lies."

00:09:29.311 --> 00:09:30.560
I mean, and what's innovation?

00:09:30.560 --> 00:09:32.870
It's just creativity
monetized, right?

00:09:32.870 --> 00:09:37.110
So how do you tap
into that unknown

00:09:37.110 --> 00:09:40.377
and then bring it
back to the known?

00:09:40.377 --> 00:09:41.960
How are you challenging
yourself to be

00:09:41.960 --> 00:09:44.630
reaching out and gathering
this data, this information?

00:09:44.630 --> 00:09:48.070
Alonzo would always say
that it's just information.

00:09:48.070 --> 00:09:51.500
Without judgment, just
see it as possibility.

00:09:51.500 --> 00:09:54.860
Without bias, allow
it to come in.

00:09:54.860 --> 00:09:58.220
The beauty is the known-- the
portion that is the known--

00:09:58.220 --> 00:10:00.010
continues to grow
throughout your life.

00:10:00.010 --> 00:10:01.480
It continues to expand.

00:10:01.480 --> 00:10:03.420
The unknown is infinite.

00:10:03.420 --> 00:10:07.180
What you don't know or what
we collectively don't know

00:10:07.180 --> 00:10:09.030
is infinite.

00:10:09.030 --> 00:10:15.040
So how do you train yourself
with still a grounding

00:10:15.040 --> 00:10:17.820
and a sense of purpose?

00:10:17.820 --> 00:10:20.330
Be tapping into
that-- that adjacent

00:10:20.330 --> 00:10:23.160
possible-- what could be.

00:10:23.160 --> 00:10:25.245
I call that the
creative process.

00:10:25.245 --> 00:10:28.090
So the creative process
is not one or the other.

00:10:28.090 --> 00:10:30.060
It's both in equal measure.

00:10:30.060 --> 00:10:32.820
There's a famous psychologist
from the University Chicago,

00:10:32.820 --> 00:10:33.820
Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi.

00:10:33.820 --> 00:10:35.170
He wrote the book "Flow."

00:10:35.170 --> 00:10:36.780
He wrote the book "Creativity."

00:10:36.780 --> 00:10:39.230
So how do you find
that flow state?

00:10:39.230 --> 00:10:40.830
He thought about it
and talks about it

00:10:40.830 --> 00:10:42.760
as sort of another XY axis.

00:10:42.760 --> 00:10:47.200
On this axis is the given
demands of a situation--

00:10:47.200 --> 00:10:48.640
how you have to measure up.

00:10:48.640 --> 00:10:51.640
And on this axis is your
proclivity or ability

00:10:51.640 --> 00:10:53.630
or aptitude for that
given situation.

00:10:53.630 --> 00:10:57.670
So if the demands are very
high, and your ability is low,

00:10:57.670 --> 00:10:59.680
you probably have
anxiety, right?

00:10:59.680 --> 00:11:02.220
If your ability is very high,
and the demands are low,

00:11:02.220 --> 00:11:03.434
you probably have apathy.

00:11:03.434 --> 00:11:05.100
But how are you in a
given moment, like,

00:11:05.100 --> 00:11:08.140
arriving at that
optimal flow state?

00:11:08.140 --> 00:11:11.750
So again, a choreographer,
in the dance world,

00:11:11.750 --> 00:11:14.340
gives you the steps,
gives you sometimes

00:11:14.340 --> 00:11:17.370
the meaning, the musicality.

00:11:17.370 --> 00:11:18.780
They create the structure.

00:11:18.780 --> 00:11:21.540
That's the data-- the
extrinsic, the quantitative.

00:11:21.540 --> 00:11:22.660
You can't change that.

00:11:22.660 --> 00:11:24.255
You can't violate it.

00:11:24.255 --> 00:11:26.630
And like Alonzo would say, I
don't want to see the steps.

00:11:26.630 --> 00:11:27.520
I want to see the ideas.

00:11:27.520 --> 00:11:29.000
What are you going
to do with it?

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:33.010
What you do with it,
that's art-making.

00:11:33.010 --> 00:11:35.490
It's not just how well
you went out on stage

00:11:35.490 --> 00:11:37.180
and did those steps.

00:11:37.180 --> 00:11:43.190
It's how you made them prescient
and available and spontaneous

00:11:43.190 --> 00:11:45.240
in this moment.

00:11:45.240 --> 00:11:47.854
So I now work at the
University of Chicago

00:11:47.854 --> 00:11:49.270
with the Booth
School of Business.

00:11:49.270 --> 00:11:52.650
I'm the first Visiting
Artist &amp; Social Entrepreneur.

00:11:52.650 --> 00:11:54.190
It's a bunch of words, right?

00:11:54.190 --> 00:11:56.850
Like, it takes me a
while to say them.

00:11:56.850 --> 00:11:59.600
We're making this up as we go.

00:11:59.600 --> 00:12:03.090
The cool thing is University
of Chicago Booth School

00:12:03.090 --> 00:12:06.090
of Business is not necessarily
known for being the most

00:12:06.090 --> 00:12:08.089
fluid-state environment.

00:12:08.089 --> 00:12:10.380
They are known for being the
most conservative business

00:12:10.380 --> 00:12:13.910
school in the world, where free
market capitalism was invented.

00:12:13.910 --> 00:12:18.330
But even within that
very, in some ways,

00:12:18.330 --> 00:12:20.995
solid-state environment, there
are some brilliant teachers

00:12:20.995 --> 00:12:22.370
and educators,
one in particular,

00:12:22.370 --> 00:12:25.080
a man named Harry Davis,
who's been there 53 years.

00:12:25.080 --> 00:12:29.680
And he's been teaching the
impact of the arts on business

00:12:29.680 --> 00:12:32.220
for longer than I've been alive.

00:12:32.220 --> 00:12:32.991
And so we met.

00:12:32.991 --> 00:12:34.740
And in one meeting,
he said, what would it

00:12:34.740 --> 00:12:38.070
look like if you
came and started

00:12:38.070 --> 00:12:40.330
playing in this environment?

00:12:40.330 --> 00:12:43.050
So I've been there two
and a half years now.

00:12:43.050 --> 00:12:46.690
I question a lot of times, like,
why did I make this decision?

00:12:46.690 --> 00:12:49.370
Why did I choose to go into
this environment in which we

00:12:49.370 --> 00:12:53.400
don't really speak the
same language, right?

00:12:53.400 --> 00:12:57.100
And kind of in hindsight,
two and a half years in,

00:12:57.100 --> 00:13:00.540
it's understanding how these
ideas I knew as an artist

00:13:00.540 --> 00:13:02.850
and as a dancer-- these
ideas of creative process

00:13:02.850 --> 00:13:05.210
can be translated,
can become applicable

00:13:05.210 --> 00:13:06.752
in different scenarios.

00:13:06.752 --> 00:13:08.710
I'm skipping over a
crucial element, which is I

00:13:08.710 --> 00:13:12.340
also cofounded and ran as the
executive director for a decade

00:13:12.340 --> 00:13:13.980
my own dance company.

00:13:13.980 --> 00:13:17.210
So for a decade, I was
dancing while having to bring

00:13:17.210 --> 00:13:19.390
in millions of dollars a year.

00:13:19.390 --> 00:13:20.390
I was the booking agent.

00:13:20.390 --> 00:13:21.765
I managed the
board of directors.

00:13:21.765 --> 00:13:23.074
I managed the staff.

00:13:23.074 --> 00:13:26.920
I, yeah, philanthropically was
raising money while dancing.

00:13:26.920 --> 00:13:31.090
And it was during that time
I left Alonzo's tutelage,

00:13:31.090 --> 00:13:33.520
this man that was
incredibly brilliant

00:13:33.520 --> 00:13:36.360
and had really allowed
me to tap into this--

00:13:36.360 --> 00:13:38.610
and we'll say more in it
throughout our conversation--

00:13:38.610 --> 00:13:40.400
this idea of creative process.

00:13:40.400 --> 00:13:43.100
And for the first time,
I was in a scenario

00:13:43.100 --> 00:13:44.660
where I was the
executive director.

00:13:44.660 --> 00:13:47.000
I was pretty young-- early 20s.

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:48.880
I didn't really know
what I was doing.

00:13:48.880 --> 00:13:53.170
But I had to begin to learn how
to apply these same concepts.

00:13:53.170 --> 00:13:55.696
How do you go about
raising $2 million a year?

00:13:55.696 --> 00:13:57.320
I sat with people,
and they said, well,

00:13:57.320 --> 00:13:58.390
you break it into buckets.

00:13:58.390 --> 00:13:59.710
How much are you going to
raise from individuals,

00:13:59.710 --> 00:14:01.918
from foundations, from
government, from corporations?

00:14:01.918 --> 00:14:03.710
How many from special events?

00:14:03.710 --> 00:14:06.630
How much is fee for
services for touring?

00:14:06.630 --> 00:14:07.620
How much is education?

00:14:07.620 --> 00:14:08.540
You break it into the buckets.

00:14:08.540 --> 00:14:10.789
And you make this budget at
the beginning of the year.

00:14:10.789 --> 00:14:13.200
And your board of directors--
you know, approved.

00:14:13.200 --> 00:14:14.460
Here's your budget.

00:14:14.460 --> 00:14:16.840
And then I remember the first
year, I was like, oh, crap.

00:14:16.840 --> 00:14:19.090
Like, how do I do this?

00:14:19.090 --> 00:14:23.690
How do I suddenly
conjure up this money?

00:14:23.690 --> 00:14:26.840
So how do you deal
with the unknown?

00:14:26.840 --> 00:14:28.260
Another way of
saying it is risk.

00:14:28.260 --> 00:14:29.900
How do you deal with risk?

00:14:29.900 --> 00:14:34.800
Most systems try to minimize
risk to such a degree

00:14:34.800 --> 00:14:37.930
that we strategize
before the process.

00:14:37.930 --> 00:14:40.470
Before you implement,
you've strategized

00:14:40.470 --> 00:14:42.220
exactly how this will play out.

00:14:42.220 --> 00:14:45.090
And you've tried to minimize
the risk to the degree you could

00:14:45.090 --> 00:14:46.780
that when you
implement everything

00:14:46.780 --> 00:14:51.150
is going to follow a
pretty set system, right?

00:14:51.150 --> 00:14:56.290
Being an artist and
working with Alonzo--

00:14:56.290 --> 00:14:58.320
by doing that, if
I went out on stage

00:14:58.320 --> 00:15:01.600
and just only did
the steps, right,

00:15:01.600 --> 00:15:04.170
you've robbed yourself
of all that input.

00:15:04.170 --> 00:15:06.160
You've robbed yourself
of all that possibility.

00:15:06.160 --> 00:15:08.450
If you're only working in
the known in a derivative

00:15:08.450 --> 00:15:10.500
system that's been
laid out, you're

00:15:10.500 --> 00:15:15.450
not allowing yourself to be
able to bring in and channel

00:15:15.450 --> 00:15:16.575
all this other information.

00:15:19.100 --> 00:15:21.470
I love to go back and
spend time with Alonzo.

00:15:21.470 --> 00:15:25.310
A couple months ago, I was
in the studio observing.

00:15:25.310 --> 00:15:27.450
And the choreography
was this female dancer.

00:15:27.450 --> 00:15:31.219
Beautiful-- she's 6
foot, 1, long limbs.

00:15:31.219 --> 00:15:33.260
The choreography was that
she had to walk forward

00:15:33.260 --> 00:15:35.616
and then just
stand for a moment.

00:15:35.616 --> 00:15:36.990
And then at the
right moment, she

00:15:36.990 --> 00:15:41.706
had to launch into this, like,
very dramatic, big solo-- huge,

00:15:41.706 --> 00:15:42.205
expansive.

00:15:42.205 --> 00:15:43.890
And it was all
about power and how

00:15:43.890 --> 00:15:46.280
you're exercising
all these faculties

00:15:46.280 --> 00:15:47.900
and a lot of articulation.

00:15:47.900 --> 00:15:51.140
But she walked forward, and she
was like a horse at the gate,

00:15:51.140 --> 00:15:52.225
just ready to go.

00:15:52.225 --> 00:15:53.100
And then she started.

00:15:53.100 --> 00:15:56.620
And Alonzo stopped, and he
said, you have to come forward.

00:15:56.620 --> 00:16:01.150
And you have to have a moment
where you let it all go.

00:16:01.150 --> 00:16:03.620
In Zen Buddhism, they
call that beginner's mind.

00:16:03.620 --> 00:16:06.480
Like, you can't know
what you're about to do.

00:16:06.480 --> 00:16:10.410
You almost have to
choose to not know

00:16:10.410 --> 00:16:13.220
so that you can be
present, so that you

00:16:13.220 --> 00:16:17.270
can allow what's about
to happen to work on you

00:16:17.270 --> 00:16:19.220
as much as you're
about to work on it.

00:16:19.220 --> 00:16:24.740
So a second ago when I
said, listening and telling,

00:16:24.740 --> 00:16:26.350
you can't just get
out there and tell.

00:16:26.350 --> 00:16:28.220
Like, I'm showing
you all these steps.

00:16:28.220 --> 00:16:30.080
And here's what it is.

00:16:30.080 --> 00:16:33.860
Because the human condition is
such that in any given moment,

00:16:33.860 --> 00:16:36.385
you don't know most of
what's going to happen.

00:16:36.385 --> 00:16:37.760
And if you're not
making yourself

00:16:37.760 --> 00:16:39.710
available to that
kind of unknown--

00:16:39.710 --> 00:16:43.290
if you're not listening,
you're robbing yourself

00:16:43.290 --> 00:16:44.180
of what's possible.

00:16:44.180 --> 00:16:47.560
So right now I'm sitting here
telling things towards you.

00:16:47.560 --> 00:16:49.560
I'm saying a bunch of words.

00:16:49.560 --> 00:16:52.790
This is actually very
much a conversation.

00:16:52.790 --> 00:16:57.320
Maybe because I am a ballet
dancer, I know who's into it.

00:16:57.320 --> 00:16:59.060
I know who's
checking their phone.

00:16:59.060 --> 00:17:01.800
I know who's taking notes and
who's actually doing email.

00:17:01.800 --> 00:17:03.650
I can tell, like,
when you lean in when

00:17:03.650 --> 00:17:05.349
I say something
that was of import

00:17:05.349 --> 00:17:07.510
and when you like
drift off again.

00:17:07.510 --> 00:17:09.420
And this is a dialogue.

00:17:09.420 --> 00:17:11.909
And so I'm exercising
my own creative process

00:17:11.909 --> 00:17:13.450
at this moment of,
like, I don't know

00:17:13.450 --> 00:17:14.930
what I'm going to say to you.

00:17:14.930 --> 00:17:19.500
I have a grab bag of quotes
and stories and pieces of data

00:17:19.500 --> 00:17:21.740
that I could tell you.

00:17:21.740 --> 00:17:24.579
But for this to be really
a moment that we're

00:17:24.579 --> 00:17:28.329
sharing, like, a present
moment where we're really,

00:17:28.329 --> 00:17:32.090
like, hopefully arriving at
something together and not just

00:17:32.090 --> 00:17:34.290
this transaction where I'm
sending out information,

00:17:34.290 --> 00:17:36.710
and then you're absorbing
it and hopefully

00:17:36.710 --> 00:17:39.110
processing-- if this is really
going to be something more

00:17:39.110 --> 00:17:41.070
aspirational, and we're
building something

00:17:41.070 --> 00:17:44.200
in this collective,
collaborative moment,

00:17:44.200 --> 00:17:46.660
I have to be present.

00:17:46.660 --> 00:17:49.180
Presence is another
way of talking

00:17:49.180 --> 00:17:51.100
about the creative process.

00:17:51.100 --> 00:17:54.391
It's that balance
of all these things.

00:17:54.391 --> 00:17:55.890
You can't just come
in and know what

00:17:55.890 --> 00:17:57.610
you're going to say and say it.

00:17:57.610 --> 00:18:01.130
It has to be a relationship
that we're having right now.

00:18:01.130 --> 00:18:03.100
So in my current line
of work, I consult

00:18:03.100 --> 00:18:07.290
for hedge funds and companies
and civic governments.

00:18:07.290 --> 00:18:08.860
I coach MBAs.

00:18:08.860 --> 00:18:10.520
I coach entrepreneurs.

00:18:10.520 --> 00:18:14.610
I teach workshops and
classes on similar themes,

00:18:14.610 --> 00:18:16.950
similar things I'm
saying to you today.

00:18:16.950 --> 00:18:19.040
But a lot of them have
real-world applications.

00:18:19.040 --> 00:18:23.930
So I work with teams, companies
to help them identify,

00:18:23.930 --> 00:18:26.186
what is your creative process.

00:18:26.186 --> 00:18:27.810
And what's interesting
is people always

00:18:27.810 --> 00:18:32.380
think I'm going to show up
and give them 10-step lists.

00:18:32.380 --> 00:18:35.310
Do these 10 things, and
you, too, can be creative.

00:18:35.310 --> 00:18:37.500
I work with a man at the
University of Chicago

00:18:37.500 --> 00:18:39.670
who runs the Center
for Wisdom Research.

00:18:39.670 --> 00:18:41.378
And he said something
really fascinating.

00:18:41.378 --> 00:18:44.760
He said, there's no such
thing as a wise person.

00:18:44.760 --> 00:18:48.070
There's only wise choices.

00:18:48.070 --> 00:18:50.330
So I think that applies.

00:18:50.330 --> 00:18:53.110
There's no such thing
as a creative person.

00:18:53.110 --> 00:18:55.810
There's only creative choices.

00:18:55.810 --> 00:18:58.730
So creativity is like,
yeah, maybe if you're,

00:18:58.730 --> 00:19:01.190
in one given day, you made
majority creative choices, you

00:19:01.190 --> 00:19:04.980
might be a creative person for
that day-- maybe in a year,

00:19:04.980 --> 00:19:08.144
like, if you are exercising
creative choice-making.

00:19:08.144 --> 00:19:10.060
But below that level of
creative choice-making

00:19:10.060 --> 00:19:11.810
is what I'm calling
this creative process.

00:19:11.810 --> 00:19:13.770
It's that internal
balance of how

00:19:13.770 --> 00:19:17.100
you're seeing a given situation,
being adaptable, responding

00:19:17.100 --> 00:19:20.310
to it, and then arriving at
that-- again, 2/3 reality,

00:19:20.310 --> 00:19:22.790
1/3 possibility--
how are you arriving

00:19:22.790 --> 00:19:24.350
at that what's possible?

00:19:24.350 --> 00:19:26.240
That's what creative
choice-making is.

00:19:26.240 --> 00:19:28.150
It's not the derivative system.

00:19:28.150 --> 00:19:32.010
It's not the staid, here's what
we've already have figured out,

00:19:32.010 --> 00:19:33.120
just implement system.

00:19:33.120 --> 00:19:36.910
It's here's what I know, and
here's what could happen.

00:19:36.910 --> 00:19:40.380
So how are you making
creative choices?

00:19:40.380 --> 00:19:43.520
How are you exercising
that creative process

00:19:43.520 --> 00:19:45.620
to arrive at this balance?

00:19:45.620 --> 00:19:48.850
It's not an additive
process, I've found.

00:19:48.850 --> 00:19:51.710
Like Alonzo said, you
have to walk forward,

00:19:51.710 --> 00:19:54.480
and you actually have to let go.

00:19:54.480 --> 00:19:56.480
There's another
expression in Zen Buddhism

00:19:56.480 --> 00:19:58.130
that the water is going to flow.

00:19:58.130 --> 00:20:01.240
Like, if a stream or a
river is already flowing,

00:20:01.240 --> 00:20:02.550
it's going to flow.

00:20:02.550 --> 00:20:05.090
It's can you remove
more and more rocks

00:20:05.090 --> 00:20:10.057
to allow it to flow even more--
to flow even more smoothly?

00:20:10.057 --> 00:20:11.890
So the creative process,
as I think about it

00:20:11.890 --> 00:20:13.870
when I consult for
these companies,

00:20:13.870 --> 00:20:17.230
is really a reductive process.

00:20:17.230 --> 00:20:19.460
What are you doing
that's preventing you

00:20:19.460 --> 00:20:22.520
from kind of accessing
all that information?

00:20:22.520 --> 00:20:24.530
What are your internal biases?

00:20:24.530 --> 00:20:26.940
What are the rules or
obligations or constraints

00:20:26.940 --> 00:20:29.510
that you think you
have to live by?

00:20:29.510 --> 00:20:32.040
What are the behaviors or
ways that you show up that you

00:20:32.040 --> 00:20:33.600
think are expected of you?

00:20:37.772 --> 00:20:39.230
Creativity is also
just the ability

00:20:39.230 --> 00:20:41.990
to see one thing from
multiple perspectives

00:20:41.990 --> 00:20:44.860
and to exercise empathy
to see the bigger picture

00:20:44.860 --> 00:20:47.310
and then arrive at a creative
choice, which might be,

00:20:47.310 --> 00:20:50.380
we're going to take all that
information-- all that data--

00:20:50.380 --> 00:20:51.930
and then we're
going to arrive at,

00:20:51.930 --> 00:20:54.970
but what is the most
interesting or new or unexpected

00:20:54.970 --> 00:21:02.110
way to now display this hand
moving forward into the world?

00:21:02.110 --> 00:21:05.140
It's usually a reductive
process in the sense

00:21:05.140 --> 00:21:08.210
that the information's
already there.

00:21:08.210 --> 00:21:09.710
Sometimes you're
just not seeing it.

00:21:09.710 --> 00:21:11.709
Or sometimes you're not
letting yourself believe

00:21:11.709 --> 00:21:13.100
that that could be the answer.

00:21:13.100 --> 00:21:17.530
Or sometimes you're just-- we
all are getting more caught up

00:21:17.530 --> 00:21:21.710
in the form and what we can
be measured against rather

00:21:21.710 --> 00:21:25.920
than that next thing that is
amorphous and not fully formed

00:21:25.920 --> 00:21:27.201
and shaped yet.

00:21:27.201 --> 00:21:28.700
That's one of the
biggest hindrances

00:21:28.700 --> 00:21:34.310
I see when I consult for more
solid-state organizations,

00:21:34.310 --> 00:21:36.590
corporations, civic governments.

00:21:36.590 --> 00:21:38.127
I remember there
was a company here

00:21:38.127 --> 00:21:39.710
in Chicago that had
me come in to help

00:21:39.710 --> 00:21:42.392
them be more innovative.

00:21:42.392 --> 00:21:44.350
And they said, well, we
tried to be innovative.

00:21:44.350 --> 00:21:45.766
We created this
whole system where

00:21:45.766 --> 00:21:47.060
people would be incentivized.

00:21:47.060 --> 00:21:49.490
And they'd get paid extra
if they were innovative

00:21:49.490 --> 00:21:52.680
and if they came up with new
ideas and new potentials.

00:21:52.680 --> 00:21:54.240
And he said, it
failed miserably.

00:21:54.240 --> 00:21:55.910
Nobody was willing to take risk.

00:21:55.910 --> 00:21:58.220
No one was willing
to go there because

00:21:58.220 --> 00:22:01.380
in the end, a lot of
times, we as humans

00:22:01.380 --> 00:22:04.260
will do the thing we know we
can be measured on, right?

00:22:04.260 --> 00:22:04.950
We do the thing.

00:22:04.950 --> 00:22:07.490
We invest the time, the
resources, the energy

00:22:07.490 --> 00:22:10.350
as long as we know that
at the end what we did

00:22:10.350 --> 00:22:12.730
is worthwhile because it
measures up to certain existing

00:22:12.730 --> 00:22:14.590
standards.

00:22:14.590 --> 00:22:19.126
It's very hard to move beyond
the standards and step out.

00:22:19.126 --> 00:22:21.000
And with this analogy
of the one foot planted

00:22:21.000 --> 00:22:22.416
and the other foot
searching, it's

00:22:22.416 --> 00:22:25.440
not that you just suddenly,
like, go into a freefall.

00:22:25.440 --> 00:22:27.810
It's that you're challenging
yourself to kind of always

00:22:27.810 --> 00:22:31.970
be on that space
in between, right?

00:22:31.970 --> 00:22:34.390
The space in between this
action and this action--

00:22:34.390 --> 00:22:36.720
there's so much information
right there in between.

00:22:36.720 --> 00:22:38.570
I was getting my foot
X-rayed recently.

00:22:38.570 --> 00:22:40.350
And the doctor said, you
have really good cartilage.

00:22:40.350 --> 00:22:41.460
I said, how can you tell?

00:22:41.460 --> 00:22:43.920
Because on the X-ray,
it's just black and white.

00:22:43.920 --> 00:22:47.430
He said, there was a lot of
space in between the bones.

00:22:47.430 --> 00:22:50.030
I was like, oh, that's
what I'm getting at here.

00:22:50.030 --> 00:22:52.535
The creative process is this,
like, piece of cartilage.

00:22:52.535 --> 00:22:53.890
It's that buffer.

00:22:53.890 --> 00:22:55.951
In the brain, they call
it the corpus callosum,

00:22:55.951 --> 00:22:58.200
the webbing that's connecting
the right and left sides

00:22:58.200 --> 00:22:59.690
of the brain.

00:22:59.690 --> 00:23:02.360
For decades or
even a century now,

00:23:02.360 --> 00:23:03.930
we knew about the
corpus callosum.

00:23:03.930 --> 00:23:06.170
And neuroscientists
and doctors didn't

00:23:06.170 --> 00:23:08.970
think it had any purpose because
it didn't light up in the way

00:23:08.970 --> 00:23:10.428
that other parts
of the brain were.

00:23:10.428 --> 00:23:13.430
So they actually would sever it
in certain types of patients.

00:23:13.430 --> 00:23:15.050
People with
epilepsy-- they found

00:23:15.050 --> 00:23:16.770
if they severed the
corpus callosum,

00:23:16.770 --> 00:23:18.590
the seizures would be less.

00:23:18.590 --> 00:23:20.450
But what started to
happen was people

00:23:20.450 --> 00:23:23.130
began to have-- they were
robbed of certain forms

00:23:23.130 --> 00:23:24.810
of emotional reasoning.

00:23:24.810 --> 00:23:26.720
Their EQ was diminished.

00:23:26.720 --> 00:23:28.490
Their IQ stayed intact.

00:23:28.490 --> 00:23:32.250
But other ways of
perceiving diminished.

00:23:32.250 --> 00:23:34.200
So this webbing--
this space in between,

00:23:34.200 --> 00:23:36.700
where you don't really know
what it is and where it goes.

00:23:36.700 --> 00:23:40.150
So this is the thing with
a lot of these companies.

00:23:40.150 --> 00:23:43.100
How do you invest
time, resources, energy

00:23:43.100 --> 00:23:44.700
in the unknown?

00:23:44.700 --> 00:23:48.270
How do you set aside-- and
obviously, here at Google,

00:23:48.270 --> 00:23:51.370
there are practices and
methods for which Google

00:23:51.370 --> 00:23:52.950
has done that historically.

00:23:52.950 --> 00:23:55.080
How do you set aside--
what is it now?

00:23:55.080 --> 00:23:56.230
Is it 20% time still?

00:23:56.230 --> 00:23:57.570
I always forget.

00:23:57.570 --> 00:24:01.370
How do you incentivize
people having unformed time?

00:24:01.370 --> 00:24:03.180
How do you give
people permission

00:24:03.180 --> 00:24:05.220
to delve into that space?

00:24:05.220 --> 00:24:07.800
How do you give
people permission

00:24:07.800 --> 00:24:10.990
to not be productive?

00:24:10.990 --> 00:24:15.120
Our analytic mine operates a
lot of times off of alpha waves.

00:24:15.120 --> 00:24:19.130
And it's all about the action
steps, the action skills.

00:24:19.130 --> 00:24:21.540
The insightful mind is a
different part of your brain

00:24:21.540 --> 00:24:24.420
that operates a lot of
time off of gamma waves.

00:24:24.420 --> 00:24:28.250
It can only be active when
the alpha mind, alpha waves--

00:24:28.250 --> 00:24:30.880
the analytic mind-- is at rest.

00:24:30.880 --> 00:24:33.980
So that's why you always
get those quotes of,

00:24:33.980 --> 00:24:36.660
it came to them in the
shower, or it came to them

00:24:36.660 --> 00:24:38.130
while they were
going for a walk.

00:24:38.130 --> 00:24:40.100
It's because the moment
you take your mind off

00:24:40.100 --> 00:24:44.260
of this-- the action, the step,
the thought-- your unconscious

00:24:44.260 --> 00:24:45.660
keeps working on it.

00:24:45.660 --> 00:24:47.940
And then that insight pops up.

00:24:47.940 --> 00:24:51.570
So how do you train-- I think,
let's start chatting now.

00:24:51.570 --> 00:24:56.300
How do you train your mind to
practice insightful thinking

00:24:56.300 --> 00:24:57.630
versus analytic thinking?

00:24:57.630 --> 00:25:02.340
How do you train your mind to
step into the unknown, still

00:25:02.340 --> 00:25:04.590
grounded in the known,
and be able to bring

00:25:04.590 --> 00:25:06.400
that information back?

00:25:06.400 --> 00:25:11.090
How do you exercise your own
personal creative process?

00:25:11.090 --> 00:25:13.160
And what I do for a living
is I help individuals

00:25:13.160 --> 00:25:13.760
think about that.

00:25:13.760 --> 00:25:15.260
And then I help
them think about how

00:25:15.260 --> 00:25:17.200
we do it as a team,
and as an organization,

00:25:17.200 --> 00:25:19.100
and all the layers.

00:25:19.100 --> 00:25:21.840
But I find usually people
eradicate the creative process

00:25:21.840 --> 00:25:26.400
very quickly because
they keep reverting back

00:25:26.400 --> 00:25:30.220
to what can be measured and what
can be stated unequivocally.

00:25:30.220 --> 00:25:34.240
So I think we're-- yeah.

00:25:34.240 --> 00:25:35.710
I will pose that as a question.

00:25:35.710 --> 00:25:39.145
How do you practice
the creative process?

00:25:39.145 --> 00:25:39.770
You can answer.

00:25:39.770 --> 00:25:40.760
Anyone can answer.

00:25:40.760 --> 00:25:41.730
Yes, sir.

00:25:41.730 --> 00:25:43.310
AUDIENCE: By
introducing deadlines.

00:25:43.310 --> 00:25:47.424
By giving myself false deadlines
that I have to stick to.

00:25:47.424 --> 00:25:49.421
Usually, I buy or
invest [INAUDIBLE].

00:25:49.421 --> 00:25:51.545
JOHN MICHAEL SCHERT: False
deadlines-- I like that.

00:25:54.660 --> 00:25:55.220
Yeah.

00:25:55.220 --> 00:25:55.810
Anyone else?

00:25:58.431 --> 00:25:58.930
Yes.

00:25:58.930 --> 00:26:01.550
AUDIENCE: I think
for me, it came down

00:26:01.550 --> 00:26:02.570
to the permission thing.

00:26:02.570 --> 00:26:06.140
So I'll, like, set time in my
calendar actually to, like,

00:26:06.140 --> 00:26:09.550
set aside for that sort
of thinking to actually

00:26:09.550 --> 00:26:12.130
explicitly give yourself
permission to do it.

00:26:12.130 --> 00:26:15.837
So you actually feel like
you're still time-managed.

00:26:15.837 --> 00:26:17.420
So you're going to
get the things done

00:26:17.420 --> 00:26:18.610
you need to get done.

00:26:18.610 --> 00:26:21.550
And you don't feel as bad
allotting that time to just

00:26:21.550 --> 00:26:22.450
[INAUDIBLE].

00:26:22.450 --> 00:26:23.360
JOHN MICHAEL SCHERT:
Yeah, I love that.

00:26:23.360 --> 00:26:24.730
I do both those things, as well.

00:26:24.730 --> 00:26:27.750
Every day, for me, I have
an hour block on my calendar

00:26:27.750 --> 00:26:30.060
that's just, like, unknown time.

00:26:30.060 --> 00:26:31.810
I put it there sometimes
months in advance

00:26:31.810 --> 00:26:33.440
so I don't violate it later.

00:26:33.440 --> 00:26:36.020
And I also put these arbitrary
deadlines on my calendar.

00:26:36.020 --> 00:26:40.010
I'm a very visual person, so
my calendar is, like, God.

00:26:40.010 --> 00:26:41.190
What else?

00:26:41.190 --> 00:26:43.574
AUDIENCE: I think when you
think about creativity,

00:26:43.574 --> 00:26:44.990
about something
that as kids we're

00:26:44.990 --> 00:26:47.070
always-- it's something
we just naturally do.

00:26:47.070 --> 00:26:49.410
And as we grow older
[INAUDIBLE] school or whatever,

00:26:49.410 --> 00:26:50.244
we lose that habit.

00:26:50.244 --> 00:26:52.160
And I think one of the
stories that I've heard

00:26:52.160 --> 00:26:55.270
is that, for those people
that have kids, right,

00:26:55.270 --> 00:26:57.230
they bring this crazy drawing.

00:26:57.230 --> 00:26:59.011
And as a parent,
you're not going

00:26:59.011 --> 00:27:01.510
to be, like, that's the ugliest
house I've ever seen, right?

00:27:01.510 --> 00:27:02.301
Quite the opposite.

00:27:02.301 --> 00:27:04.870
You tell kids, that's
the most beautiful house

00:27:04.870 --> 00:27:06.700
I've seen in my entire life.

00:27:06.700 --> 00:27:09.390
That's, like, that
creativity that once you

00:27:09.390 --> 00:27:11.370
get into the real
world, you lose

00:27:11.370 --> 00:27:13.673
the ability to be able to
do that because, I mean,

00:27:13.673 --> 00:27:16.390
you talk about risk, right,
that if it's not done right,

00:27:16.390 --> 00:27:18.020
then I shouldn't do it.

00:27:18.020 --> 00:27:20.160
So for me, it's like where
I identify with, like,

00:27:20.160 --> 00:27:23.280
what I'm passionate about
and carving time to do that,

00:27:23.280 --> 00:27:25.990
whether it's reading or
writing or something that sort

00:27:25.990 --> 00:27:26.949
of strikes [INAUDIBLE].

00:27:26.949 --> 00:27:28.031
JOHN MICHAEL SCHERT: Yeah.

00:27:28.031 --> 00:27:29.150
I heard a story recently.

00:27:29.150 --> 00:27:31.825
A teacher said, what
are you drawing, Susie?

00:27:31.825 --> 00:27:33.700
And she's like, I'm
drawing a picture of God.

00:27:33.700 --> 00:27:35.866
She's like, honey, no one
knows what God looks like.

00:27:35.866 --> 00:27:37.270
She's like, they're about to.

00:27:37.270 --> 00:27:40.470
It's the idea that,
like, my perspective

00:27:40.470 --> 00:27:42.935
is equal or valuable and giving
yourself permission for it.

00:27:42.935 --> 00:27:44.060
Yeah, you had your hand up.

00:27:44.060 --> 00:27:48.100
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
I heard this expression

00:27:48.100 --> 00:27:51.030
once-- interesting input
makes for interesting output.

00:27:51.030 --> 00:27:54.600
So I want to try and get access
kind of the insightful mind.

00:27:54.600 --> 00:27:57.614
Give myself permission
just to [INAUDIBLE]

00:27:57.614 --> 00:27:59.652
input that inspires me.

00:27:59.652 --> 00:28:00.880
JOHN MICHAEL SCHERT: Yeah.

00:28:00.880 --> 00:28:03.770
Permission-giving is really hard
sometimes to give to ourselves

00:28:03.770 --> 00:28:05.440
because, again, we can
default back to all the things

00:28:05.440 --> 00:28:07.080
that we know we have
to do or should do.

00:28:07.080 --> 00:28:08.705
I call them the coulds
and the shoulds.

00:28:08.705 --> 00:28:10.680
Like, we know what
we should go do.

00:28:10.680 --> 00:28:12.430
And we know what we
could go do because we

00:28:12.430 --> 00:28:15.260
have the aptitude or the
ability or the opportunity.

00:28:15.260 --> 00:28:17.840
It's often hard to give
equal weight to the want.

00:28:17.840 --> 00:28:19.650
Like, what do I want to go do?

00:28:19.650 --> 00:28:21.710
And oftentimes, the
best information

00:28:21.710 --> 00:28:24.915
comes from, like, the
intrinsically motivated

00:28:24.915 --> 00:28:27.040
or carving out the time to
give yourself permission

00:28:27.040 --> 00:28:31.924
to just put food in your head.

00:28:31.924 --> 00:28:34.090
AUDIENCE: Can you talk a
little bit more about that?

00:28:34.090 --> 00:28:37.760
Like, both as a person, how do
you give yourself permission?

00:28:37.760 --> 00:28:40.060
But then maybe your role
as a consultant [INAUDIBLE]

00:28:40.060 --> 00:28:44.290
other companies, how do you
go up to an organization

00:28:44.290 --> 00:28:47.360
that's done things for the past
10 years, and it's worked well

00:28:47.360 --> 00:28:49.785
and ask them to give permission
to try something new?

00:28:49.785 --> 00:28:51.410
Like, what's that
first step look like?

00:28:51.410 --> 00:28:52.520
JOHN MICHAEL SCHERT:
Well, I mean,

00:28:52.520 --> 00:28:53.880
sometimes it's good
just to frame it as in,

00:28:53.880 --> 00:28:55.740
let's agree on some
universal truths.

00:28:55.740 --> 00:28:57.200
Like, change is constant.

00:28:57.200 --> 00:29:01.240
So any system has already become
antiquated with every day,

00:29:01.240 --> 00:29:01.740
right?

00:29:01.740 --> 00:29:06.034
So you have to be generating
new potential ways of seeing.

00:29:06.034 --> 00:29:07.700
It's not about new
ways of implementing.

00:29:07.700 --> 00:29:09.325
But it is definitely
new ways of, like,

00:29:09.325 --> 00:29:12.372
are you staying always
aware that you're absorbing

00:29:12.372 --> 00:29:13.455
more and more information?

00:29:13.455 --> 00:29:15.230
Now, analytics is a
great way to do it.

00:29:15.230 --> 00:29:16.896
Like, this balance
of form and feeling--

00:29:16.896 --> 00:29:18.760
like, the quant side
is super important

00:29:18.760 --> 00:29:20.060
because it's how we're
going and gathering

00:29:20.060 --> 00:29:21.351
information and bringing it in.

00:29:21.351 --> 00:29:23.470
But then again, what do
you do with that data?

00:29:23.470 --> 00:29:24.440
How do you process it?

00:29:24.440 --> 00:29:27.050
So a lot of companies will
say, oh, our system is working.

00:29:27.050 --> 00:29:29.957
But we all know if you're not
always tapping in and getting

00:29:29.957 --> 00:29:32.040
into that adjacent possible--
if you're not always

00:29:32.040 --> 00:29:36.010
living on that precipice
that we keep talking about,

00:29:36.010 --> 00:29:41.104
you will quickly be antiquated.

00:29:41.104 --> 00:29:42.520
Like, that's just
going to happen.

00:29:42.520 --> 00:29:44.600
So usually, I can frame
it in that way for them.

00:29:44.600 --> 00:29:47.470
And they're like, oh yeah, we
can accept that as a truth.

00:29:47.470 --> 00:29:51.540
And then the next
step is getting

00:29:51.540 --> 00:29:54.390
them to realize how they're
already giving themselves

00:29:54.390 --> 00:29:56.380
permission to make
creative choices,

00:29:56.380 --> 00:29:58.817
or how they're already doing it.

00:29:58.817 --> 00:30:00.650
So how can I help them
reinforce that that's

00:30:00.650 --> 00:30:01.820
a really valid thing?

00:30:01.820 --> 00:30:04.360
But usually, it falls in that,
again, that space in between.

00:30:04.360 --> 00:30:06.120
It's not like a system
they have in place.

00:30:06.120 --> 00:30:07.250
Like, you work for one
of the few companies

00:30:07.250 --> 00:30:09.625
in the world that have systems
for those sorts of things.

00:30:09.625 --> 00:30:11.200
Most companies don't.

00:30:11.200 --> 00:30:13.820
So getting them to acknowledge--
it's always the, like,

00:30:13.820 --> 00:30:16.766
amazing-to-have-it skill, but
no one knows how to teach it.

00:30:16.766 --> 00:30:18.390
I think you can teach
all those things.

00:30:18.390 --> 00:30:19.460
You can train them.

00:30:19.460 --> 00:30:21.330
Those are skills
that you can work on.

00:30:21.330 --> 00:30:24.670
So it's-- and I hate the
expression "soft skills"

00:30:24.670 --> 00:30:25.920
because usually it's not hard.

00:30:25.920 --> 00:30:26.610
It's not real.

00:30:26.610 --> 00:30:29.407
But it usually lies more in
that qualitative soft side.

00:30:29.407 --> 00:30:31.740
So I usually get them to think
about how they're already

00:30:31.740 --> 00:30:32.250
doing it.

00:30:32.250 --> 00:30:34.910
Are the individuals
in their midst

00:30:34.910 --> 00:30:36.240
that are already doing it?

00:30:36.240 --> 00:30:37.590
I try to help champion.

00:30:37.590 --> 00:30:41.711
I mean, I'm completely-- it's
a bit subversive, but it's not.

00:30:41.711 --> 00:30:43.960
Like, I think we should be
elevating creative thinkers

00:30:43.960 --> 00:30:47.097
to be leaders-- civically
and corporations.

00:30:47.097 --> 00:30:49.680
I think every board of directors
should have an artist sitting

00:30:49.680 --> 00:30:51.600
at the table, someone
that really holds

00:30:51.600 --> 00:30:53.850
the space for creative
process because you already

00:30:53.850 --> 00:30:58.867
have at the table 10 dudes
who speak money and finance.

00:30:58.867 --> 00:31:00.700
And you've got people
that speak legalities.

00:31:00.700 --> 00:31:02.830
And you have scientists
and engineers.

00:31:02.830 --> 00:31:06.900
And you have people that deal
in liability and insurance.

00:31:06.900 --> 00:31:08.630
But you don't always
carve out a space

00:31:08.630 --> 00:31:11.840
for that person who really
practices a creative process

00:31:11.840 --> 00:31:13.090
at a very heightened level.

00:31:13.090 --> 00:31:16.370
So I try to find the people
that are already doing it,

00:31:16.370 --> 00:31:19.080
especially the ones that are
already in senior positions

00:31:19.080 --> 00:31:21.580
and help sort of, like,
fortify that what they've done

00:31:21.580 --> 00:31:23.474
is super worthwhile.

00:31:23.474 --> 00:31:24.890
A lot of times,
everyone knows it.

00:31:24.890 --> 00:31:27.220
But they haven't really,
like, built a system around it

00:31:27.220 --> 00:31:31.440
or, like, incentivized it in a
way that allows others to feel

00:31:31.440 --> 00:31:32.817
they, too, can be that way.

00:31:32.817 --> 00:31:33.900
We always fall back on it.

00:31:33.900 --> 00:31:36.290
Like, in a law firm
that I was working with,

00:31:36.290 --> 00:31:38.507
one senior partner was,
like, incredibly creative.

00:31:38.507 --> 00:31:39.840
And everyone, like, praised him.

00:31:39.840 --> 00:31:41.217
He was the Steve Jobs of law.

00:31:41.217 --> 00:31:42.550
Somehow, he broke all the rules.

00:31:42.550 --> 00:31:43.690
And he went and did all
these things the way

00:31:43.690 --> 00:31:45.100
no one had ever done it before.

00:31:45.100 --> 00:31:46.933
But when you talked to
the junior associates

00:31:46.933 --> 00:31:48.847
and whatnot, why don't
you act more like him?

00:31:48.847 --> 00:31:50.680
Well, I can't because
he's a senior partner.

00:31:50.680 --> 00:31:52.090
And he has all these
permissions I don't have,

00:31:52.090 --> 00:31:53.810
and he can do
things in this way.

00:31:53.810 --> 00:31:57.600
People think that
like, you chew the fat.

00:31:57.600 --> 00:32:00.850
You do the work, and then you
get to a level of a status.

00:32:00.850 --> 00:32:03.630
And then you can start to
exercise creative process.

00:32:03.630 --> 00:32:05.930
I think it's more like a
well-marbled piece of meat.

00:32:05.930 --> 00:32:08.720
Like, you have to be practicing
this creative process.

00:32:08.720 --> 00:32:10.160
The best piece of
the cut of meat

00:32:10.160 --> 00:32:12.400
has, like, the fat and
the meat all together.

00:32:12.400 --> 00:32:13.630
It's more flavorful.

00:32:13.630 --> 00:32:14.784
It's more valuable.

00:32:14.784 --> 00:32:16.200
But we think, oh,
we're just going

00:32:16.200 --> 00:32:19.430
to do this very, like,
left-brained way of doing

00:32:19.430 --> 00:32:19.930
things.

00:32:19.930 --> 00:32:21.470
And then we can get to that.

00:32:21.470 --> 00:32:23.890
And when I mentor MBAs
and whatnot, and I say,

00:32:23.890 --> 00:32:26.310
if you don't start
practicing that skill now,

00:32:26.310 --> 00:32:29.330
it won't be available
to you at 45.

00:32:29.330 --> 00:32:32.862
So junior associates think,
I don't have that permission.

00:32:32.862 --> 00:32:34.320
And so I say, well,
I've been hired

00:32:34.320 --> 00:32:36.017
to come here to tell you do.

00:32:36.017 --> 00:32:37.100
So it's permission-giving.

00:32:37.100 --> 00:32:40.510
But it's permission-giving
over and over and over again.

00:32:40.510 --> 00:32:43.890
And it's helping them understand
all the ways they're not

00:32:43.890 --> 00:32:45.560
giving themselves permission.

00:32:45.560 --> 00:32:48.120
Why did they stop
at that moment?

00:32:48.120 --> 00:32:50.840
And it's usually,
again, because they

00:32:50.840 --> 00:32:54.520
have some idea that
someone else is going

00:32:54.520 --> 00:32:56.020
to tell them they can't do it.

00:32:56.020 --> 00:32:58.522
And that's almost
never the case.

00:32:58.522 --> 00:32:59.022
Yes.

00:32:59.022 --> 00:33:02.772
AUDIENCE: What are some of the
things that have been really,

00:33:02.772 --> 00:33:04.990
kind of stood out
to you when working

00:33:04.990 --> 00:33:06.890
with these more
traditional, like,

00:33:06.890 --> 00:33:09.330
financial companies,
for example,

00:33:09.330 --> 00:33:14.334
of when you have spotted
creativity in leadership?

00:33:14.334 --> 00:33:15.375
What does that look like?

00:33:15.375 --> 00:33:19.450
Like, I guess,
what's a good example

00:33:19.450 --> 00:33:24.450
of how the
corporation can, like,

00:33:24.450 --> 00:33:26.790
weave in that
creativity really well

00:33:26.790 --> 00:33:29.900
in the context of a
nontraditionally creative

00:33:29.900 --> 00:33:30.888
company?

00:33:30.888 --> 00:33:32.370
JOHN MICHAEL SCHERT: Yeah.

00:33:32.370 --> 00:33:34.170
On a human level, it's
usually the person

00:33:34.170 --> 00:33:38.110
that's listening the
most and practicing

00:33:38.110 --> 00:33:40.370
epistemic humility, which
is a term meaning, like,

00:33:40.370 --> 00:33:41.532
choosing to be humble.

00:33:41.532 --> 00:33:43.990
It's the person that's choosing
to practice beginner's mind

00:33:43.990 --> 00:33:44.970
and not know.

00:33:44.970 --> 00:33:47.162
They might be the most
senior brilliant person.

00:33:47.162 --> 00:33:49.120
So what's the difference
between a smart choice

00:33:49.120 --> 00:33:51.310
and a wise choice and
a creative choice?

00:33:51.310 --> 00:33:52.605
This is what one of my
colleagues at the University

00:33:52.605 --> 00:33:53.438
of Chicago works on.

00:33:53.438 --> 00:33:55.100
Like, so a smart
choice is what we all

00:33:55.100 --> 00:33:56.849
are trained to do in
our education system.

00:33:56.849 --> 00:33:58.040
Like, it's more analytic.

00:33:58.040 --> 00:33:59.500
It's more, like, you
add up these things,

00:33:59.500 --> 00:34:00.820
and you arrive at the solution.

00:34:00.820 --> 00:34:03.361
I've already talked a bit about
creative choice-making, which

00:34:03.361 --> 00:34:05.777
is, like, that overlap
of the Venn diagram

00:34:05.777 --> 00:34:06.610
and the possibility.

00:34:06.610 --> 00:34:08.835
And if you could tap into
that, what's possible?

00:34:08.835 --> 00:34:10.210
What's more of a
creative choice?

00:34:10.210 --> 00:34:12.300
Because you're allowing yourself
to open up to the unknown.

00:34:12.300 --> 00:34:13.813
Wise choice-making--
and everyone

00:34:13.813 --> 00:34:15.229
knows Maslow's
hierarchy of needs.

00:34:15.229 --> 00:34:17.830
At some point you've
seen that-- that pyramid.

00:34:17.830 --> 00:34:20.050
Wise choice-making
is the top pinnacle--

00:34:20.050 --> 00:34:22.650
helping others unlock
their full potential.

00:34:22.650 --> 00:34:24.659
Processiality--
another key component

00:34:24.659 --> 00:34:27.620
of wise choice-making--
is epistemic humility,

00:34:27.620 --> 00:34:30.560
which is the ability
to, like, not

00:34:30.560 --> 00:34:33.610
exercise ego in
choice-making and also

00:34:33.610 --> 00:34:36.100
to be available to others.

00:34:36.100 --> 00:34:39.070
You know, Warren Buffett says, I
spend most of my time thinking,

00:34:39.070 --> 00:34:40.960
just sitting there.

00:34:40.960 --> 00:34:43.460
It's not measurable.

00:34:43.460 --> 00:34:46.050
Now, of course, he has these
outputs that are amazing.

00:34:46.050 --> 00:34:47.780
So we're all like, well,
let's all act more like Warren

00:34:47.780 --> 00:34:48.280
Buffett.

00:34:48.280 --> 00:34:50.310
But why do more people
not just spend time

00:34:50.310 --> 00:34:54.219
letting their unconscious
mind be at play?

00:34:54.219 --> 00:34:56.469
So when I find it in
these companies, again,

00:34:56.469 --> 00:34:59.160
and someone at a high
level is practicing

00:34:59.160 --> 00:35:01.460
more what I would call
wise choice-making, which

00:35:01.460 --> 00:35:03.670
has built into it smart
choice-making, which

00:35:03.670 --> 00:35:08.730
is level five of Maslow's, and
creative choice-making, which

00:35:08.730 --> 00:35:12.980
I would say is level seven
of Maslow's, like-- but,

00:35:12.980 --> 00:35:15.181
again, it's more of an
allowing, a permission-giving

00:35:15.181 --> 00:35:16.180
they give to themselves.

00:35:16.180 --> 00:35:18.730
And then the
companies-- even, like,

00:35:18.730 --> 00:35:21.020
solid-state, traditional
companies-- that

00:35:21.020 --> 00:35:24.240
seem to do it well,
they don't always

00:35:24.240 --> 00:35:28.180
presuppose that their status,
their power, their market share

00:35:28.180 --> 00:35:31.270
is permanent.

00:35:31.270 --> 00:35:35.080
And they are very
open to possibility.

00:35:35.080 --> 00:35:36.910
They don't rule out
ideas right away.

00:35:36.910 --> 00:35:41.560
They don't have as much judgment
about when an idea comes up,

00:35:41.560 --> 00:35:42.410
they give it weight.

00:35:42.410 --> 00:35:44.609
They give it time--
within reason--

00:35:44.609 --> 00:35:46.400
because this is where
you start to then run

00:35:46.400 --> 00:35:48.790
into time management and
systems management and all

00:35:48.790 --> 00:35:49.920
those other things.

00:35:49.920 --> 00:35:54.914
But one of the hedge funds I
work with, a brilliant man--

00:35:54.914 --> 00:35:56.080
it's actually a mutual fund.

00:35:56.080 --> 00:35:59.170
He said, I never
sought to make money.

00:35:59.170 --> 00:36:00.460
I never sought growth.

00:36:00.460 --> 00:36:01.600
And now he's a billionaire.

00:36:01.600 --> 00:36:04.220
But he said, I just wanted
to do cool things that

00:36:04.220 --> 00:36:05.801
were interesting to me.

00:36:05.801 --> 00:36:07.550
So there's a lot of
behavioral science now

00:36:07.550 --> 00:36:11.200
that shows if you seek the
reward-- the extrinsic reward--

00:36:11.200 --> 00:36:14.320
you rob yourself of the
intrinsic creative process.

00:36:14.320 --> 00:36:17.090
If you seek the intrinsic
creative process,

00:36:17.090 --> 00:36:19.650
you're, A, more
self-fulfilled and happy.

00:36:19.650 --> 00:36:22.420
And then if you still get
the reward, it's a bonus.

00:36:22.420 --> 00:36:24.010
But we set up a
lot of our systems

00:36:24.010 --> 00:36:26.040
to be measuring what's
the outcome going to be.

00:36:26.040 --> 00:36:27.400
I'm just going to
work towards that.

00:36:27.400 --> 00:36:29.274
And they've robbed
themselves of the process.

00:36:31.640 --> 00:36:33.768
Jess, you had something.

00:36:33.768 --> 00:36:38.020
AUDIENCE: I was just
[INAUDIBLE] to your [INAUDIBLE]

00:36:38.020 --> 00:36:40.340
expectations and the
feeling sometimes

00:36:40.340 --> 00:36:44.940
that hinders me
creatively when I

00:36:44.940 --> 00:36:49.982
set either unrealistic or
somehow not [INAUDIBLE] or not

00:36:49.982 --> 00:36:50.940
realistic expectations.

00:36:50.940 --> 00:36:53.148
And then I feel like I didn't
deliver, which creates,

00:36:53.148 --> 00:36:54.392
like, something [INAUDIBLE].

00:36:56.807 --> 00:36:57.890
JOHN MICHAEL SCHERT: Yeah.

00:36:57.890 --> 00:37:01.140
AUDIENCE: So I think
I've gotten better at it.

00:37:01.140 --> 00:37:04.072
And it's really hard to create
realistic expectations that

00:37:04.072 --> 00:37:06.920
are still, like, impactful.

00:37:06.920 --> 00:37:08.300
JOHN MICHAEL SCHERT: Yeah.

00:37:08.300 --> 00:37:12.689
I think it's people
are really good again,

00:37:12.689 --> 00:37:14.230
at naming the coulds
and the shoulds,

00:37:14.230 --> 00:37:16.230
like what they should do
and what they could do.

00:37:16.230 --> 00:37:18.980
And then they often make
that their entire expectation

00:37:18.980 --> 00:37:19.740
setting.

00:37:19.740 --> 00:37:22.710
And so how do you factor
in from the onset--

00:37:22.710 --> 00:37:27.370
from the beginning, the outset--
also the intrinsic motivation?

00:37:27.370 --> 00:37:37.080
I find that we often sell our--
we often set up the expectation

00:37:37.080 --> 00:37:38.610
with our boss,
with our employer,

00:37:38.610 --> 00:37:40.400
with ourself, or
with others that's

00:37:40.400 --> 00:37:42.422
all based on others'
expectations of you

00:37:42.422 --> 00:37:44.005
and not your
expectations of yourself.

00:37:44.005 --> 00:37:45.260
It's kind of a pat answer.

00:37:45.260 --> 00:37:47.540
But I'll say more later
because I know you.

00:37:47.540 --> 00:37:48.415
And we can talk more.

00:37:48.415 --> 00:37:50.290
But I think we're coming
up on end of time.

00:37:50.290 --> 00:37:51.990
Does anyone have
one more question?

00:37:51.990 --> 00:37:55.320
And if not, I just want to
say, thanks for hanging out

00:37:55.320 --> 00:37:56.850
for an hour or so.

00:37:56.850 --> 00:38:00.692
And of course, it's very
exciting what Google does.

00:38:00.692 --> 00:38:02.690
And that's why I was
excited to come and chat

00:38:02.690 --> 00:38:04.090
with you all today
because I know

00:38:04.090 --> 00:38:07.050
I'm talking-- preaching to the
choir, in a lot of respects.

00:38:07.050 --> 00:38:10.080
But it's always
fascinating to come

00:38:10.080 --> 00:38:13.000
into different environments and
hear what you're thinking on.

00:38:13.000 --> 00:38:14.750
So I'd love to continue the
dialogue with any of you

00:38:14.750 --> 00:38:16.041
if you want to, like, chat now.

00:38:16.041 --> 00:38:17.690
Or just email and chat later.

00:38:17.690 --> 00:38:18.580
But thanks so much.

00:38:18.580 --> 00:38:19.413
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:38:19.413 --> 00:38:21.828
[APPLAUSE]
