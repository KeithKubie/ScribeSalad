00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:03.280
When you think of how to stop a major disease
outbreak, you’re probably thinking of a

00:00:03.280 --> 00:00:07.890
scene from a medical thriller; where a world
renowned virologist is helicoptered out in

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:12.090
a race against time to find the person who’s
the source of the infection.

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:14.280
The Patient Zero.

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:16.010
Patient Zero isn’t just a Hollywood creation.

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:20.530
It’s a real thing in the medical community
and it identifies the first carrier of a disease

00:00:20.530 --> 00:00:22.109
in an outbreak.

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:27.240
Identifying the origin of a disease helps
scientists understand and prevent future pandemics.

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:29.480
These things have to start somewhere.

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:34.280
But figuring out who Patient Zero is requires
a great deal of detective work.

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:38.059
Health experts go out into the field and map
the transmission of a virus.

00:00:38.059 --> 00:00:42.940
They follow a molecular game of telephone
(called contact tracing) which involves searching

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:46.269
for everyone who came into contact with a
sick patient.

00:00:46.269 --> 00:00:50.620
According to an epidemiologist we spoke to,
it’s helpful to find out how a virus travels

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:51.819
through a community.

00:00:51.819 --> 00:00:58.170
It’s a way to classify the disease (as airborne
or foodborne for instance) and work on a vaccine.

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:04.720
Though movies tell a different story, finding
Patient Zero isn’t as big a deal as preventing

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:09.410
an outbreak from spreading.Plus… searching
for the scapegoat in situations like this

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:13.060
can easily turn into a public witch hunt.

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:17.320
For example, back in the 1980s during the
height of the AIDS epidemic, researchers at

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:22.549
the CDC interviewed several HIV patients looking
for the source of the infection.

00:01:22.549 --> 00:01:25.770
They constructed a network of 40 infected
men.

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:31.100
All 40 were connected to one gay airline flight
attendant who was then vilified and dubbed

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:34.859
Patient Zero of the AIDS epidemic by the media.

00:01:34.859 --> 00:01:36.399
But, it wasn’t that guy.

00:01:36.399 --> 00:01:42.009
Later, genetic analysis found HIV had been
floating around the US throughout the 1970s,

00:01:42.009 --> 00:01:44.830
evolving within different hosts for years.

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:46.179
Science exonerated him!

00:01:46.179 --> 00:01:49.049
In fact, he’s so not patient zero.

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:53.630
A separate genetic analysis found the actual
patient zero has roots that go all the way

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:59.110
back to chimps in Africa... people were slaughtering
them for their meat, exposing themselves to

00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:00.640
the HIV virus…

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:05.280
Which is common, many diseases start in animals
and then move over to humans, otherwise known

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:06.680
as spillover.

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:12.370
MERS came from camels, SARS from bats, and
H5N1 or bird flu from birds…

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:16.790
When they come in contact with humans, a disease
is considered zoonotic, and can be very deadly.

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:19.629
But, to bring it back to finding patient zero...

00:02:19.629 --> 00:02:25.030
Remember, epidemiologists want to contain
the outbreak, not find someone to blame.

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:29.670
Which is why the process of shoe-leather epidemiology
is a big deal.

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:33.230
Scientists go out and find who did what, when
and where.

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:37.099
It’s very much like a detective novel for
the path of a disease.

00:02:37.099 --> 00:02:41.540
Finding wider connections is important because
of something called the 20/80 Rule..

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:47.610
Basically, 20 percent of a population causes
80 percent of infections -- that 20 percent

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:50.860
has a name: Superspreaders.

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:54.030
Superspreaders are the ones who make a virus,
well, go viral.

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:59.140
The SARS and ebola outbreaks both had superspreaders,
that flight attendant was very likely a superspreader.

00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:06.019
In 2011, there was an outbreak of methicillin-resistant
staphylococcus aureus, or MRSA, a superbug

00:03:06.019 --> 00:03:07.129
in a baby ward.

00:03:07.129 --> 00:03:11.890
By using fast genome sequencing technology,
a team of researchers were able to work quickly

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:16.819
to trace the source to a staff member who
was unwittingly carrying the strain and infecting

00:03:16.819 --> 00:03:20.820
patients -- they’re not patient zero, but
the PZ didn’t matter.

00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:22.360
The outbreak was contained.

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:26.680
Let’s face it, looking for Patient Zero
can be difficult and problematic, because

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:31.849
there’s really no way to actually observe
the moment when patient zero becomes Patient

00:03:31.849 --> 00:03:32.849
Zero.

00:03:32.849 --> 00:03:36.030
It’s really more of a good theory with the
best evidence we’ve got at the time.

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:40.110
But with new computer simulations, genetic
tracking and good ol’ fashioned detective

00:03:40.110 --> 00:03:45.310
work, health workers can find the superspreaders
who really drive the epidemic, putting a stop

00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:48.010
to a disease before it spreads further.

00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:52.280
Disease eradication is a seriously difficult
business, but we’ve done it… haven’t

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:53.280
we?

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:54.280
Kind of.

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:57.180
We eradicated smallpox -- find out how, in
this blast from the past, here.

00:03:57.180 --> 00:03:58.650
Why was I in a sweater?

00:03:58.650 --> 00:04:00.740
And that hair?

00:04:00.740 --> 00:04:01.740
What is happening?

00:04:01.740 --> 00:04:02.760
What was your favorite movie about the spread
of infections.

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:03.760
Let us know.

00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:07.530
Please subscribe so you get more Seeker. I went on a date once to see Contagion.

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:10.870
We shook hands and never saw each other again.

00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:11.469
Thanks for watching.
