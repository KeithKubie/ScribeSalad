00:00:00.810 --> 00:00:04.890
Which of the triangles, triangle
DEF, triangle GHI, and triangle

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:08.250
JKL, are similar
to triangle ABC?

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:10.030
And we have this triangle ABC.

00:00:10.030 --> 00:00:13.180
They've given us, or they've
just marked one of the angles,

00:00:13.180 --> 00:00:15.990
and then they've given the
lengths of the two sides

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:18.290
on either side of that angle.

00:00:18.290 --> 00:00:20.500
And you might remember
from geometry class,

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:22.390
you can prove that
two triangles are

00:00:22.390 --> 00:00:27.310
similar if you can show they
have corresponding congruent

00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:27.810
angles.

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:29.309
So let's say we're
trying to compare

00:00:29.309 --> 00:00:36.990
this triangle to this triangle,
triangle JKL to triangle ABC.

00:00:36.990 --> 00:00:39.460
So if you can show that they
have two corresponding angles

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:41.410
that are congruent
to each other,

00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:45.870
and that the sides on
either side, the ratio

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:50.830
between the sides on either
side of that angle are the same,

00:00:50.830 --> 00:00:54.160
then you're going to be dealing
with a similar triangle.

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:58.044
So, for example, if we say
that this angle corresponds

00:00:58.044 --> 00:00:59.460
to this angle, and
they've already

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:01.126
marked it to say that
they're congruent,

00:01:01.126 --> 00:01:03.100
so that's a pretty
good starting point.

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:08.550
And if we could show that
the ratio between this side

00:01:08.550 --> 00:01:17.450
and this side, side KL is the
same as the ratio between BA

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:21.900
and KJ, then we can
say that these two

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:22.910
are similar triangles.

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:24.410
Now you might be
thinking, well, how

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:29.930
did I decide to compare
BC to KL and BA to KJ?

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:34.040
Well, both of these are the two
sides that essentially make up

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:37.090
this angle, and BC is
the shorter of the two.

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:41.090
These are the two sides
that make up this angle,

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:43.110
both of these are the,
I guess you could say,

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:46.270
they're segments
of the rays, there

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:49.110
are parts of the rays that
make up this angle if you were

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:54.840
to continue forever, and the
blue one is the shorter one,

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:57.570
so that's the best candidate.

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:02.540
KL is the best candidate
to correspond to BC.

00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:04.150
Well in order to do
this, we're going

00:02:04.150 --> 00:02:06.210
to figure out the
lengths of these sides.

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:07.710
We're going to have
to do it for all

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:09.181
of these triangles
right over here.

00:02:09.181 --> 00:02:10.639
And they don't give
us the lengths,

00:02:10.639 --> 00:02:13.730
but this thing is sitting
on a coordinate plane.

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:15.710
Now you could use
the distance formula,

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:17.300
but I like to just
cut the chase.

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:19.700
The distance formula is based
on the Pythagorean theorem,

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:22.190
and they've drawn a grid
right over here for us,

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:24.736
so we could just set up some
right triangles to figure out,

00:02:24.736 --> 00:02:26.110
we could make each
of these sides

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:29.340
essentially the hypotenuse
of right triangles.

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:33.180
So to figure out
the length of KJ,

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:36.180
we could set up this right
triangle right over here.

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:39.460
This height is 3, this
length right over here

00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:46.360
we could count it, it's 1, 2,
3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 units wide.

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:49.210
If we couldn't
count like that, we

00:02:49.210 --> 00:02:51.200
could say, look,
we're going from x

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:56.360
equals negative 6 to x
equals 3, 3 minus negative 6

00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:57.550
is equal to 9.

00:02:57.550 --> 00:02:58.730
Let me make that clear.

00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:01.271
And that's essentially where
the distance formula comes from,

00:03:01.271 --> 00:03:02.460
3 minus negative 6.

00:03:02.460 --> 00:03:05.670
You're finding the change,
your change in x and you're

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:08.035
going to square it, and then
you have your change in y,

00:03:08.035 --> 00:03:09.576
you're going to
square it, and that's

00:03:09.576 --> 00:03:11.510
going to be equal to
this hypotenuse squared.

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:14.500
So let's think
about-- so this is

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:17.000
going to be equal
to the square root.

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:19.400
I'm just using the
Pythagorean theorem here.

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:21.359
So [? that line, ?]
I'll just call it so K,

00:03:21.359 --> 00:03:23.400
let me just write it out,
so that you don't think

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:25.200
I'm doing some type of voodoo.

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:27.634
So 3 squared plus-- let
me do it a little higher,

00:03:27.634 --> 00:03:29.050
because I have a
feeling I'm going

00:03:29.050 --> 00:03:33.260
to use a lot of real estate--
3 squared plus 9 squared

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:39.360
is equal to the
length of KJ squared.

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:44.986
3 squared is 27, sorry,
not 27, 3 squared is 9.

00:03:44.986 --> 00:03:48.170
9 squared is 81, and
then that's going

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:51.070
to be equal to the
length of KJ squared.

00:03:51.070 --> 00:03:57.240
Or, we get KJ squared
is equal to 90,

00:03:57.240 --> 00:04:01.710
which is the same
thing as 9 times 10.

00:04:01.710 --> 00:04:05.440
And so KJ is going to
be-- it's the square root

00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:07.300
of this, so the
square root of that

00:04:07.300 --> 00:04:10.590
is going to be the
square root of 9 times 10

00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:13.810
is equal to the
square root of 9 times

00:04:13.810 --> 00:04:18.890
the square root of 10, which is
equal to 3 square roots of 10.

00:04:18.890 --> 00:04:22.630
So it's actually the
exact same length as BA.

00:04:22.630 --> 00:04:25.430
Now let's do the
same thing for KL.

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:29.480
For KL we could set up another
right triangle right over here.

00:04:29.480 --> 00:04:32.990
So Its height is 3
and its width is 3.

00:04:32.990 --> 00:04:35.970
This is 3 and 3 right over here.

00:04:35.970 --> 00:04:40.600
So we could write 3
squared plus 3 squared

00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:44.960
is equal to the
length of KL squared.

00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:50.500
This right over here is
18 is equal to KL squared,

00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:53.540
and if you take the
square root of both sides

00:04:53.540 --> 00:04:55.470
18 is, of course, 9 times 2.

00:04:55.470 --> 00:04:59.830
So this right over here,
this is the square root of 18

00:04:59.830 --> 00:05:02.510
is equal to KL.

00:05:02.510 --> 00:05:04.060
Square root of 18
is the same thing

00:05:04.060 --> 00:05:05.590
as square root of
9 times 2, that's

00:05:05.590 --> 00:05:06.920
just 3 square roots of 2.

00:05:06.920 --> 00:05:11.030
This is equal to 3
square roots of 2.

00:05:11.030 --> 00:05:14.080
So this is 3 square roots of 2.

00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:18.010
This is 3 square roots of 10.

00:05:18.010 --> 00:05:21.920
This angle is congruent to
this angle right over here.

00:05:21.920 --> 00:05:27.050
So not only are ABC and JKL,
not only are they similar,

00:05:27.050 --> 00:05:29.250
but these are actually
congruent triangles.

00:05:29.250 --> 00:05:31.166
These are congruent
triangles right over here,

00:05:31.166 --> 00:05:34.400
but all congruent triangles
are going to be similar.

00:05:34.400 --> 00:05:38.310
So this one this one
is definitely similar.

00:05:38.310 --> 00:05:40.860
JKL is similar to ABC.

00:05:40.860 --> 00:05:43.440
Now let's figure out all
of these lengths up here.

00:05:43.440 --> 00:05:46.397
Well you have,
let's see, this is 1

00:05:46.397 --> 00:05:51.500
and 1, so you could say
1 squared plus 1 squared

00:05:51.500 --> 00:05:58.470
is equal to EF squared, is equal
to the length of segment EF

00:05:58.470 --> 00:05:59.400
squared.

00:05:59.400 --> 00:06:05.320
Or you could say EF is equal
to-- Let's see, this is 2,

00:06:05.320 --> 00:06:08.851
so this is going to be
the square root of 2.

00:06:08.851 --> 00:06:11.100
So actually I should have
done that in that blue color

00:06:11.100 --> 00:06:13.370
because this will
be the shorter,

00:06:13.370 --> 00:06:16.960
we want this to be the shorter
side if we're comparing the two

00:06:16.960 --> 00:06:19.124
sides on either
side of that angle.

00:06:19.124 --> 00:06:20.165
And now let's look at ED.

00:06:24.520 --> 00:06:27.100
So once again, we can
set up a right triangle

00:06:27.100 --> 00:06:30.570
that is 1 wide and 3 tall.

00:06:30.570 --> 00:06:36.170
And so we could say
1 squared plus 3

00:06:36.170 --> 00:06:41.980
squared is equal to the
length of ED squared.

00:06:41.980 --> 00:06:44.970
1 squared plus 3 squared,
this is going to be 10.

00:06:44.970 --> 00:06:50.140
So we get ED is equal to
the square root of 10.

00:06:50.140 --> 00:06:54.940
Now is the ratio between BC
and EF the same as the ratio

00:06:54.940 --> 00:06:58.430
between BA and ED?

00:06:58.430 --> 00:06:59.720
So let's write this down.

00:06:59.720 --> 00:07:05.070
So square root of 3,
or 3 square roots of 2

00:07:05.070 --> 00:07:08.990
over square root
of 2 is equal to 3.

00:07:08.990 --> 00:07:12.920
So the ratio between these two
blue sides between BC and EF

00:07:12.920 --> 00:07:13.880
is 3.

00:07:13.880 --> 00:07:16.310
The ratio between
these two orange sides

00:07:16.310 --> 00:07:25.410
is 3 square roots of 10
over the square root of 10,

00:07:25.410 --> 00:07:27.060
which is also 3.

00:07:27.060 --> 00:07:29.710
So the ratio between these
two corresponding sides

00:07:29.710 --> 00:07:32.440
are the same, the angle
in between is congruent,

00:07:32.440 --> 00:07:35.550
so these two triangles
are also similar.

00:07:35.550 --> 00:07:40.510
So DEF is also similar to ABC.

00:07:40.510 --> 00:07:43.070
So we have one more
to think about.

00:07:43.070 --> 00:07:48.120
So HI is a candidate to
be corresponding to BC.

00:07:48.120 --> 00:07:50.020
What's its length?

00:07:50.020 --> 00:07:52.990
Well, let's see, this
is a right triangle

00:07:52.990 --> 00:07:57.760
that's width 2, height 2, so
we could write 2 squared plus 2

00:07:57.760 --> 00:08:03.620
squared is equal to the
length of HI squared.

00:08:03.620 --> 00:08:09.790
This is 4, this is 4, so
8 is equal to the length

00:08:09.790 --> 00:08:12.360
of HI squared.

00:08:12.360 --> 00:08:15.380
And then we can take the
square root of both sides.

00:08:15.380 --> 00:08:19.530
So the square root of 8 is
equal to the length of HI,

00:08:19.530 --> 00:08:24.540
or we could say the
length of HI is equal to,

00:08:24.540 --> 00:08:26.500
let's see this is 4 times
2, so the square root

00:08:26.500 --> 00:08:29.970
of 4 times the square root
of 2 is 2 square roots of 2.

00:08:29.970 --> 00:08:32.419
So this is 2 square roots of 2.

00:08:32.419 --> 00:08:37.140
And then the candidate to be
corresponding to AB is HG,

00:08:37.140 --> 00:08:41.309
it's the longer of the two sides
on either side of this angle.

00:08:41.309 --> 00:08:49.810
So HG, we can set up a right
triangle that looks like this.

00:08:49.810 --> 00:08:54.797
It's 2 wide and 1,
2, 3, 4, 5, 6 high.

00:08:54.797 --> 00:08:56.380
So we can write, and
let's scroll over

00:08:56.380 --> 00:08:57.910
to the right a
little bit, we can

00:08:57.910 --> 00:09:01.550
write that 2 squared
plus 6 squared

00:09:01.550 --> 00:09:06.350
is equal to the
length of HG squared.

00:09:06.350 --> 00:09:09.900
So let's see, this
is 4 plus 36 is

00:09:09.900 --> 00:09:13.030
equal to the length
of HG squared.

00:09:13.030 --> 00:09:18.670
Or we get that HG is equal
to the square root of 40.

00:09:18.670 --> 00:09:22.786
Square root of 40, let's see,
how can we simplify that?

00:09:22.786 --> 00:09:26.670
That's the same thing as the
square root of 4 times 10,

00:09:26.670 --> 00:09:29.720
which is 2 times the
square root of 10.

00:09:29.720 --> 00:09:35.280
So HG is equal to 2 times
the square root of 10.

00:09:35.280 --> 00:09:37.000
Now let's compare the ratios.

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:40.650
The ratio between
BC and HI is going

00:09:40.650 --> 00:09:51.030
to be 3 square roots of 2 over
2 square roots of 2, which

00:09:51.030 --> 00:09:53.730
is 3/2.

00:09:53.730 --> 00:09:59.820
And the ratio
between BA-- let me

00:09:59.820 --> 00:10:06.460
do that in that orange color--
which is 3 square roots of 10,

00:10:06.460 --> 00:10:12.990
and HG, which is 2 square
roots of 10, is also 3/2.

00:10:12.990 --> 00:10:16.135
So all of these triangles, not
only are they similar to ABC,

00:10:16.135 --> 00:10:20.950
but they're actually all
similar to each other.
