00:00:00.307 --> 00:00:01.688
- [Voiceover] So, let's
talk a little bit about

00:00:01.688 --> 00:00:04.259
a word you might have
heard and that is Ion.

00:00:04.259 --> 00:00:06.539
Let's talk about what it is
and then we'll talk about

00:00:06.539 --> 00:00:08.239
trends in the periodic table on,

00:00:08.239 --> 00:00:12.009
on I guess how hard it is
to make something an Ion.

00:00:12.009 --> 00:00:13.206
In particular how hard it is

00:00:13.206 --> 00:00:16.175
to make something a positive ion.

00:00:16.175 --> 00:00:19.464
So, an ion is just an atom or a molecule

00:00:19.464 --> 00:00:23.140
that has charge and
it'll have charge if the

00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:25.690
protons are not equal to the electrons.

00:00:25.690 --> 00:00:29.370
Neutrons are obviously
also constituent of atoms

00:00:29.370 --> 00:00:30.519
but neutrons are neutral.

00:00:30.519 --> 00:00:31.600
What you're gonna get your charge

00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:33.559
from are your protons or electrons.

00:00:33.559 --> 00:00:34.999
So, you're going to have a net charge.

00:00:34.999 --> 00:00:38.720
If your number of, number of protons,

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:40.390
and this is for an atom or molecule.

00:00:40.390 --> 00:00:42.226
A molecule's just a bunch of,

00:00:42.226 --> 00:00:44.572
a bunch of atoms bonded together.

00:00:44.572 --> 00:00:48.099
If the number of protons does not equal

00:00:48.099 --> 00:00:51.322
the number of electrons.

00:00:51.322 --> 00:00:55.306
And you can have positive
ions if the protons are

00:00:55.306 --> 00:00:56.592
more than the number
of electrons, protons,

00:00:56.592 --> 00:00:58.329
or positive electrons or negative.

00:00:58.329 --> 00:01:00.627
And you can have negative
ions if the number

00:01:00.627 --> 00:01:03.787
of electrons are greater
than the number of protons.

00:01:03.787 --> 00:01:08.486
For example, for example, if you just had

00:01:08.486 --> 00:01:09.661
Hydrogen in it's neutral state

00:01:09.661 --> 00:01:12.182
has one proton and one electron,

00:01:12.182 --> 00:01:15.791
but if you were to take
one of those electrons away

00:01:15.791 --> 00:01:18.900
then Hydrogen would have a positive charge

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:20.361
and essentially it would just be,

00:01:20.361 --> 00:01:22.258
in its most common isotope it would just

00:01:22.258 --> 00:01:25.613
be a proton by itself.

00:01:25.613 --> 00:01:29.012
And so, when we talk about
a positive ion like this

00:01:29.012 --> 00:01:30.983
where our protons are
more than our electrons,

00:01:30.983 --> 00:01:33.604
the number of protons are more
than the number of electrons,

00:01:33.604 --> 00:01:37.927
we call these cations, cations.

00:01:37.927 --> 00:01:41.905
Cation, once again, just
another word positive ion.

00:01:41.905 --> 00:01:45.443
Likewise, we can have negative ions.

00:01:45.443 --> 00:01:48.085
So, say for example, Fluorine.

00:01:48.085 --> 00:01:50.703
So, Fluorine gains an electron,

00:01:50.703 --> 00:01:54.263
it's going to have a negative charge.

00:01:54.263 --> 00:01:56.503
It's gonna have a negative
charge of negative one,

00:01:56.503 --> 00:02:01.503
and a negative ion we call an anion.

00:02:03.086 --> 00:02:05.725
And the way that I remember this is

00:02:05.725 --> 00:02:09.727
a kind of means the opposite
or the negation of something.

00:02:09.727 --> 00:02:11.539
So, this is a negative ion.

00:02:11.539 --> 00:02:13.662
We've negating, you can somehow

00:02:13.662 --> 00:02:16.600
think we are negating the ion.

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:17.861
So, with that out of the way,

00:02:17.861 --> 00:02:21.278
let's think about how
hard it will be ionize

00:02:21.278 --> 00:02:24.112
different elements in the periodic table.

00:02:24.112 --> 00:02:28.010
In particular, how hard it
is to turn them into cations.

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:29.971
And to think about that, we'll introduce

00:02:29.971 --> 00:02:34.029
an idea called ionization energy.

00:02:34.029 --> 00:02:37.263
Ionization...

00:02:37.263 --> 00:02:41.234
Ionization energy...

00:02:41.234 --> 00:02:42.833
Energy...

00:02:42.833 --> 00:02:45.734
And this is defined, this is defined as

00:02:45.734 --> 00:02:50.734
the energy required, energy required

00:02:52.555 --> 00:02:57.555
to remove an electron,
to remove an electron.

00:03:01.072 --> 00:03:04.331
So, it could've even been
called cationization energy

00:03:04.331 --> 00:03:07.331
because you really see
energy required to remove

00:03:07.331 --> 00:03:12.242
an electron and make the
overall atom more positive.

00:03:13.283 --> 00:03:14.295
So, let's think about the trends.

00:03:14.295 --> 00:03:15.894
And we already have a
little bit of background

00:03:15.894 --> 00:03:18.797
on the different groups
of the periodic table.

00:03:18.797 --> 00:03:22.016
So, for example, if we were to focus on,

00:03:22.016 --> 00:03:24.755
especially we could look at group one,

00:03:24.755 --> 00:03:26.356
and we've already talked
about how Hydrogen's

00:03:26.356 --> 00:03:27.632
a bit of a special case in group one

00:03:27.632 --> 00:03:29.829
but if we look at
everything below Hydrogen.

00:03:29.829 --> 00:03:32.312
If we look at the Alkali, if we look

00:03:32.312 --> 00:03:34.353
at the Alkali metals here

00:03:34.353 --> 00:03:35.747
we've already talked about the fact

00:03:35.747 --> 00:03:38.576
that these are very willing
to lose an electron.

00:03:38.576 --> 00:03:40.716
Why? Because if they lose an electron

00:03:40.716 --> 00:03:43.677
they get to the electron configuration

00:03:43.677 --> 00:03:46.397
of the noble gas before it.

00:03:46.397 --> 00:03:49.797
So, if Lithium loses an electron

00:03:49.797 --> 00:03:53.349
then it has an outer shell
electron configuration of Helium.

00:03:53.349 --> 00:03:56.107
It has two outer electrons
and that's kind of,

00:03:56.107 --> 00:03:58.708
we typically talk about the Octet Rule

00:03:58.708 --> 00:04:01.947
but if we're talking about
characters like Lithium or Helium

00:04:01.947 --> 00:04:03.243
they're happy with two 'cause you can

00:04:03.243 --> 00:04:06.963
only put two electrons
in that first shell.

00:04:06.963 --> 00:04:10.672
But all the rest of 'em,
Sodium, Potassium, etc., etc.,

00:04:10.672 --> 00:04:12.955
if you take an electron away from them

00:04:12.955 --> 00:04:13.806
then their outermost shell,

00:04:13.806 --> 00:04:15.526
well, all of them in their outermost shell

00:04:15.526 --> 00:04:17.686
they're going to have the
electron configuration

00:04:17.686 --> 00:04:19.984
of the noble gas before it

00:04:19.984 --> 00:04:23.047
and for Sodium on down that outer shell

00:04:23.047 --> 00:04:24.437
is going to have that perfect eight.

00:04:24.437 --> 00:04:26.458
Lithium, if you remove an electron,

00:04:26.458 --> 00:04:27.917
it would get to Helium and it would have

00:04:27.917 --> 00:04:29.997
two electrons in its outer shell.

00:04:29.997 --> 00:04:32.294
So, you can imagine that
the ionization energy

00:04:32.294 --> 00:04:37.107
right over here, the energy
required to remove electrons

00:04:38.068 --> 00:04:42.612
from your Alkali Metals is very low.

00:04:42.612 --> 00:04:44.521
So, let me just write down this is...

00:04:44.521 --> 00:04:47.982
So, when I say low, I'm talking
about low ionization energy.

00:04:47.982 --> 00:04:49.892
Low.

00:04:49.892 --> 00:04:51.561
Now, what happens as we move to the right

00:04:51.561 --> 00:04:52.108
of the periodic table?

00:04:52.108 --> 00:04:53.546
In fact, let's go all the way

00:04:53.546 --> 00:04:55.399
to the right on the periodic table.

00:04:55.399 --> 00:04:57.121
Well, if we go here to the Noble Gases,

00:04:57.121 --> 00:04:59.380
the Noble Gases we've
already talked about.

00:04:59.380 --> 00:05:01.321
They're very, very, very stable.

00:05:01.321 --> 00:05:02.214
They don't want no one,

00:05:02.214 --> 00:05:05.094
they don't want their electron
configurations messed with.

00:05:05.094 --> 00:05:06.869
So, it would be very hard...

00:05:06.869 --> 00:05:09.347
Neon on down has their eight electrons

00:05:09.347 --> 00:05:11.267
that (mumbling) Octet Rule.

00:05:11.267 --> 00:05:14.667
Helium has two which is
full for the first shell,

00:05:14.667 --> 00:05:17.589
and so it's very hard to
remove an electron from here,

00:05:17.589 --> 00:05:20.162
and so it has a very
high ionization energy.

00:05:20.162 --> 00:05:22.661
Low energy, easy to remove electrons.

00:05:22.661 --> 00:05:24.861
Or especially the first electron,

00:05:24.861 --> 00:05:28.003
and then here you have a
high ionization energy.

00:05:28.003 --> 00:05:30.141
I know you have trouble seeing that H.

00:05:30.141 --> 00:05:34.541
So, this is high, high ionization energy,

00:05:34.541 --> 00:05:36.963
and that's the general trend
across the periodic table.

00:05:36.963 --> 00:05:38.295
As you go from left to right,

00:05:38.295 --> 00:05:43.295
you go from low ionization
energy to high ionization energy.

00:05:43.715 --> 00:05:46.444
Now, what about trends up
and down the periodic table?

00:05:46.444 --> 00:05:48.096
Well, within any group, if we,

00:05:48.096 --> 00:05:49.594
even if we look at the Alkali,

00:05:49.594 --> 00:05:52.703
if we look at the Alkali
Metals right over here,

00:05:52.703 --> 00:05:54.046
if we're down at the bottom,

00:05:54.046 --> 00:05:55.441
if we're looking at, if we're looking at,

00:05:55.441 --> 00:05:58.122
say, Cesium right over here,

00:05:58.122 --> 00:06:03.122
that electron in the, one,
two, three, four, five, six,

00:06:04.325 --> 00:06:06.425
in the sixth shell, that's going to be

00:06:06.425 --> 00:06:08.403
further from that one electron

00:06:08.403 --> 00:06:10.495
that Lithium has and its second shell.

00:06:10.495 --> 00:06:12.608
So, it's going to be, it's
going to be further away.

00:06:12.608 --> 00:06:17.287
It's not going to be as
closely bound to the nucleus,

00:06:17.287 --> 00:06:18.287
I guess you could say.

00:06:18.287 --> 00:06:19.585
So, this is going to be even,

00:06:19.585 --> 00:06:22.225
that one electron's gonna
even easier to remove

00:06:22.225 --> 00:06:25.248
than the one electron in the
outermost shell of Lithium.

00:06:25.248 --> 00:06:29.564
So, this one has even lower, even lower,

00:06:29.564 --> 00:06:32.268
even lower...

00:06:32.268 --> 00:06:35.027
And that's even going to be
true of the Noble Gases out here

00:06:35.027 --> 00:06:38.757
that Xenon, that it's electrons
in its outermost shell,

00:06:38.757 --> 00:06:41.076
even though it has
eight valence electrons,

00:06:41.076 --> 00:06:43.191
they're further away from the nucleus,

00:06:43.191 --> 00:06:45.913
and so they're a little,
the energy required

00:06:45.913 --> 00:06:47.833
to remove them is still going to be high

00:06:47.833 --> 00:06:51.190
but it's going to be lower
than the energy from,

00:06:51.190 --> 00:06:53.565
from say Neon or Helium.

00:06:53.565 --> 00:06:55.584
So, this is low.

00:06:55.584 --> 00:06:58.058
So, once again, ionization
energy low to high

00:06:58.058 --> 00:06:59.618
as we go from left to right,

00:06:59.618 --> 00:07:02.219
and low to high as we
go from bottom to top.

00:07:02.219 --> 00:07:03.435
Or we could say a general trend

00:07:03.435 --> 00:07:08.341
that if we go from the
bottom left to the top right

00:07:08.651 --> 00:07:10.806
we go from low ionization energy,

00:07:10.806 --> 00:07:12.744
very easy to remove an electron

00:07:12.744 --> 00:07:14.323
from these characters right over here

00:07:14.323 --> 00:07:16.283
to high ionization energy,

00:07:16.283 --> 00:07:19.025
very hard to move, remove an electron

00:07:19.025 --> 00:07:20.883
from these characters over here.

00:07:20.883 --> 00:07:23.284
And you can see it if, you could see

00:07:23.284 --> 00:07:26.844
in a trend of actual
measured ionization energies

00:07:26.844 --> 00:07:28.780
and I like to see charts like this because

00:07:28.780 --> 00:07:32.082
it kind of show you where
the periodic table came from

00:07:32.082 --> 00:07:34.764
when people noticed these
kind of periodic trends.

00:07:34.764 --> 00:07:35.568
It's like, hey, it looks like

00:07:35.568 --> 00:07:37.603
there's some common patterns here.

00:07:37.603 --> 00:07:40.357
But on this one in particular
we see on this axis

00:07:40.357 --> 00:07:43.238
we have ionization energy
and electron volts,

00:07:43.238 --> 00:07:44.601
that's actually, it's literally a,

00:07:44.601 --> 00:07:46.536
this is units of energy.

00:07:46.536 --> 00:07:49.329
You could convert it
to Joules if you like.

00:07:49.360 --> 00:07:51.954
Then over here, we're
increasing the atomic numbers.

00:07:51.954 --> 00:07:53.794
So, we're (mumbling), we're starting with

00:07:53.794 --> 00:07:55.616
Hydrogen then we go to Helium,

00:07:55.616 --> 00:07:58.015
and we keep, and then we go,

00:07:58.030 --> 00:08:00.065
go from Hydrogen to Helium to Lithium

00:08:00.065 --> 00:08:02.247
and let me show you what's
happening right over here.

00:08:02.247 --> 00:08:05.284
So, you go to Hydrogen to Helium.

00:08:05.284 --> 00:08:07.464
So, Helium here is very stable,

00:08:07.464 --> 00:08:10.548
so it's very hard to remove an electron.

00:08:10.548 --> 00:08:12.246
And then you go to Lithium.

00:08:12.246 --> 00:08:14.847
Lithium, as we said,
this is an Alkali metal.

00:08:14.847 --> 00:08:17.305
You remove an electron,
it gets to a stable state.

00:08:17.305 --> 00:08:20.166
So, it takes very low energy
to remove that electron.

00:08:20.166 --> 00:08:22.626
And then as we go from left to
right on the periodic table,

00:08:22.626 --> 00:08:26.467
as we go from Alkali Metal to Noble Gases

00:08:26.482 --> 00:08:29.225
we see that the ionization
energy increases.

00:08:29.225 --> 00:08:30.717
And there are these little dips here

00:08:30.717 --> 00:08:32.977
which you could think about why these...

00:08:32.977 --> 00:08:35.345
(mumbling) Or theorize why
these dips are occurring,

00:08:35.345 --> 00:08:36.726
what you see in this general trend

00:08:36.726 --> 00:08:40.904
as we go from Alkali
Metals to Noble Gases.

00:08:40.904 --> 00:08:43.486
Alkali Metals to Noble Gases.

00:08:43.486 --> 00:08:45.948
Alkali Metals to Noble Gases.

00:08:45.948 --> 00:08:47.025
Now, one thing you might be saying is,

00:08:47.025 --> 00:08:50.149
"Hey, look, you had from here to here,

00:08:50.149 --> 00:08:52.028
"that's the same distance as here to here,

00:08:52.028 --> 00:08:53.578
"but now we have a larger distance here.

00:08:53.578 --> 00:08:54.819
"What's going on here?"

00:08:54.819 --> 00:08:55.729
Well, we have to remember now we

00:08:55.729 --> 00:08:58.577
have all of our D block elements.

00:08:58.577 --> 00:09:02.848
So, now, once we get, once we get to the,

00:09:02.848 --> 00:09:05.908
once we get over here we're now adding

00:09:05.908 --> 00:09:08.268
all of the D block elements.

00:09:08.268 --> 00:09:09.888
(mumbling) On the fourth period

00:09:09.888 --> 00:09:13.369
and so we have those, we
have those added here,

00:09:13.369 --> 00:09:15.330
so you have D block
elements, D block elements,

00:09:15.330 --> 00:09:18.708
and then here you have you
F and D block elements.

00:09:18.708 --> 00:09:20.776
And so, you see the general trend

00:09:20.776 --> 00:09:24.780
that your Alkali, your Alkali Metals

00:09:24.780 --> 00:09:26.829
are very low ionization energy.

00:09:26.829 --> 00:09:31.742
Your Noble Gases, very
high ionization energy.

00:09:31.742 --> 00:09:35.059
But as they get, as the
atoms get larger and larger

00:09:35.059 --> 00:09:37.537
the ionization energy
goes lower and lower,

00:09:37.537 --> 00:09:39.239
and sends something like Radon,

00:09:39.239 --> 00:09:40.816
which even though it's Noble Gas

00:09:40.816 --> 00:09:43.897
it's ionization energy because
those outermost electrons

00:09:43.897 --> 00:09:46.551
are further away from the nucleus

00:09:46.551 --> 00:09:48.652
or they're quite far
away from the nucleus,

00:09:48.652 --> 00:09:52.699
that its ionization energy is actually,

00:09:52.699 --> 00:09:54.349
its ionization energy is

00:09:54.349 --> 00:09:58.258
actually less then that of Hydrogen.

00:09:58.258 --> 00:10:01.306
Anyway, hope you found that interesting.
