00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:03.200
[gentle music]

00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:05.200
Gomez: Wallapop is app
with a simple concept.

00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:07.000
Just consists
on a flea market

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.680
on your mobile phone
and every item is localized.

00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:13.120
On your mobile device,
Wallapop simulates

00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:15.280
a walk around your neighborhood

00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:16.640
and you start discovering
the stuff

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:18.160
that your neighbors are selling.

00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:20.520
Really provides
this impulsive buying behavior.

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:23.320
Very different to common
classified experience.

00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:25.600
There was a point of my life
when I decided

00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:27.040
it's time to start
a new challenge.

00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:29.320
So I decided to start
Wallapop in Barcelona.

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:31.280
The day one
we were only two people

00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:33.320
and after one month
of the development

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:35.360
we achieved
the number one position

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:37.240
in Spain in the Play Store.

00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:40.480
One of the keys of Wallapop
has been its simplicity.

00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:43.840
People from 15 year olds
to 60 has been selling stuff

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:44.840
on the Wallapop site.

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:46.840
And more than 70% of our users

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:49.240
come from the Android platform.

00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:51.320
Gui: My name is Marta
and I work on Wallapop

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:53.240
as a growth hacking manager.

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:56.560
We started using store listing
experiments one year ago

00:00:56.560 --> 00:01:00.800
and after testing we optimized
the organic downloads by 17%.

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:02.320
At the beginning
we started testing

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:03.880
too much things
at the same time,

00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:05.560
so result wasn't congruent

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:07.840
so we decided
to test step-by-step.

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:10.680
What we decided to test first
was the short description.

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:14.360
And we optimized 6%
of organic downloads.

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:17.480
For the next test was with
our Business Intelligence Team

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:19.920
and they told us which were
the top sold products.

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:22.520
So we did
four different experiments

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:23.960
with the four
highlighted products

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:26.080
to test how attractive
it was for the users.

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:27.840
What we found out
while testing this

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:29.760
is that there were
two type of users:

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:32.600
the decisive users
and the experienced users.

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:35.200
So what we did
is to work on a cover

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:38.120
that will be very recognizeable
for this decisive users

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:39.880
using the main slogan
of Wallapop

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:42.480
and the things that they saw
on the TV ad.

00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:44.360
We even test shuffling
the screens

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:45.920
to see what effect
this will have

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:48.400
and we see very good results.

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:50.960
When creating your
Google Play store page

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:52.760
you have to think about
the first impression

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:54.920
because it might be the only
chance you have

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:57.400
to convince a user
to download your app.

00:01:57.400 --> 00:01:59.560
Gomez:
Since we started Wallapop

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:01.520
we have grown
a very huge family.

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:04.480
This incredible success
has been something that

00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:06.120
is gonna happen
once in a lifetime

00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:08.520
and I'm very grateful
to have been able

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:11.640
just to lead all this team.
It has been the toughest

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:14.240
and the greatest experience
of my life.
