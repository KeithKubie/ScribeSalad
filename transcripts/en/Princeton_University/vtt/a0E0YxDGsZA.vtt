science teachers taught by master teachers and Princeton professors. A hundred percent

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:33.820 position:97%

and they get excited about what I am teaching.

We hope that by making ourselves available and as a resource we can play

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:15.510 position:97%

that are happening in the research lab today. This is our sixth year. We have trained over
