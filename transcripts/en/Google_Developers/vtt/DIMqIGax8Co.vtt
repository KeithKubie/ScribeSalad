ASTRO TELLER: About
five years ago,

00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:18.560
right as Google X
was being birthed,

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:20.400
I sat down with Larry Page.

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:23.060
And I was trying to work
with him on how we were going

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:26.520
to talk about what Google X is.

00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:29.950
And I was having a hard time
getting something concise out

00:00:29.950 --> 00:00:30.560
of him.

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:35.280
So I just started throwing
things at him to respond to.

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:38.080
So I said, are we
a research center?

00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:39.620
He said, "no."

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:42.350
I'm glad to hear that.

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:44.200
Are we an incubator?

00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:45.835
"Sort of, not really."

00:00:45.835 --> 00:00:47.710
Are we just another
business unit for Google?

00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:49.160
Is that what we're going to be?

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:52.140
"No."

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:56.200
The original vision statement
that Kennedy gave to the nation

00:00:56.200 --> 00:01:00.040
in 1961, that we were going
to put a man on the moon

00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:02.380
and return him safely by
the end of the decade,

00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:05.230
was the original
moonshot proposal,

00:01:05.230 --> 00:01:08.520
at least in the moonshot sense.

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:11.700
So I was delighted when I--
after 10 of these things,

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:14.080
I threw out to Larry,
are we taking moonshots?

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:17.420
And he said, "yes,
that's what we're doing."

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:19.750
That made me really happy.

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:21.840
So from that afternoon
on, what I've

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:25.080
been telling the
people at Google X

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:29.300
is that we're trying to
build a moonshot factory.

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:33.360
What I mean by that is that
we're trying to take moonshots.

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:36.370
That word is to
remind us that we're

00:01:36.370 --> 00:01:41.950
trying to work on things that
are very hard, that aspire

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:45.460
to make the world 10
times better in some way

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:48.340
than it currently
is, not 10% better,

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:51.330
to remind us about the
risks that we're taking

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:54.260
and the long-term nature of the
work that we have ahead of us

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:56.190
when we try to do these things.

00:01:56.190 --> 00:01:59.160
The word factory is
meant to remind us

00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:03.550
that even though we are doing
these risky long term things,

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:07.000
that we want to pursue
doing them with an eye

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.919
to actually having the
impact that we aspire to,

00:02:09.919 --> 00:02:14.650
that we're building products
and services for the real world.

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:18.930
Fast forward five years,
I'm tickled, I confess,

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:21.070
to see that the
word moonshot has

00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:25.580
made its way, fairly heavily
now, into the popular lexicon.

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:28.540
I understand though-- I
haven't seen the show myself--

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:34.490
that the TV show, "Silicon
Valley," the Google in it

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:35.700
is called Hooli.

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:39.120
And they've now started their
own Google X-like organization,

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:41.740
which they call XYZ, instead.

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:43.620
And it's taking moonshots also.

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:45.450
And I've personally
been upgraded

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:48.621
from captain of moonshots to
head daydreamer in the TV show,

00:02:48.621 --> 00:02:49.120
apparently.

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:57.590
The fact that it's out
there is important.

00:02:57.590 --> 00:03:00.180
And part of the reason that
I think that it's important

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:02.590
is that there's this
bizarre-- it's understandable,

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:05.360
but it's this frustrating
game of "Not It"

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:08.000
that we all play with ourselves.

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:11.067
So the small companies say,
I can't take moonshots.

00:03:11.067 --> 00:03:13.650
That's for big companies to do
because it costs a lot of money

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:15.620
to take moonshots.

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:17.540
The big companies
say, well, we aren't

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:19.600
going to take
moonshots because that

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:21.450
means taking a lot of risk.

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:22.620
That's not really our game.

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:24.870
That's what the small companies
should do because they

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:27.320
have nothing to lose.

00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:29.590
The governments say, well,
you know like 50 years ago,

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:30.740
we were taking moonshots.

00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:33.490
But that's not really
our thing anymore.

00:03:33.490 --> 00:03:36.270
We have to work on popular,
immediate problems.

00:03:36.270 --> 00:03:37.370
We don't have any money.

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:39.870
Like, that just
can't be us, sorry.

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:42.590
Academics love talking
about moonshots.

00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:44.300
They like writing the papers.

00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:47.570
They actually produce some of
the underlying science that,

00:03:47.570 --> 00:03:50.010
later, can turn into a
moonshot, but they're not

00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:52.320
the system builders
who are going to build

00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:53.890
the moonshot themselves.

00:03:53.890 --> 00:03:56.000
Everyone thinks it's
someone else's job.

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:58.500
But we're not going to fix the
biggest problems in the world

00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:01.160
if everyone thinks it's
someone else's job.

00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:05.000
The truth is, we can
all work on moonshots.

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:09.260
Working on things that aspire
to be 10 times better, rather

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:12.080
than 10% better, is a mindset.

00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:12.830
That's what it is.

00:04:12.830 --> 00:04:14.750
It's got nothing
to do specifically

00:04:14.750 --> 00:04:17.740
with the risk, or the
money, or the time frame.

00:04:17.740 --> 00:04:20.870
It's a mindset about what
we're working towards.

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:23.380
And counterintuitive
as it is, if you

00:04:23.380 --> 00:04:26.340
work on things that aspire
to be that much better,

00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:28.480
it not only isn't
harder, sometimes

00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:31.010
it's literally
easier because, when

00:04:31.010 --> 00:04:33.480
you aspire to make the
world that much better,

00:04:33.480 --> 00:04:35.270
you have to start over.

00:04:35.270 --> 00:04:38.810
And when you've acknowledged
to yourself as a team

00:04:38.810 --> 00:04:40.793
that you're going
to start over, you

00:04:40.793 --> 00:04:43.270
know that what's
going to happen next

00:04:43.270 --> 00:04:46.040
can't be built on what
people have done before.

00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:47.760
You have to, in a
meaningful sense,

00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:49.600
come at it from a
new perspective.

00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:52.640
And that often, not
always, but often unlocks

00:04:52.640 --> 00:04:58.590
possibilities that make the
impossible seem possible.

00:04:58.590 --> 00:05:00.840
So this is our
blueprint for how we

00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:03.820
take moonshots, for
what a moonshot should

00:05:03.820 --> 00:05:05.456
be in our minds.

00:05:05.456 --> 00:05:06.830
The first thing
is that there has

00:05:06.830 --> 00:05:10.174
to be a huge problem in the
world that we want to resolve,

00:05:10.174 --> 00:05:11.840
that we want to have
go away or mitigate

00:05:11.840 --> 00:05:13.420
in some meaningful way.

00:05:13.420 --> 00:05:16.560
So for example,
1.2 million people

00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:19.450
die every year in car accidents.

00:05:19.450 --> 00:05:23.180
More than a trillion
dollars is wasted every year

00:05:23.180 --> 00:05:25.850
with people sitting in traffic.

00:05:25.850 --> 00:05:28.480
That is a legitimately
world scale

00:05:28.480 --> 00:05:31.670
problem it would be awesome
if we could make go away.

00:05:31.670 --> 00:05:34.460
Number two, there has to be
a radical proposal for how

00:05:34.460 --> 00:05:36.110
to make that problem go away.

00:05:36.110 --> 00:05:38.670
If it's something that people
have tried over and over before

00:05:38.670 --> 00:05:41.970
in the past, the idea that
we or you or anyone else

00:05:41.970 --> 00:05:45.020
by just trying harder, or
staying up later at night

00:05:45.020 --> 00:05:47.230
is not really a good outcome.

00:05:47.230 --> 00:05:49.580
It's not very likely to work.

00:05:49.580 --> 00:05:53.190
So cars that drive themselves
all the way from point A

00:05:53.190 --> 00:05:55.410
to point B-- I think
that's like the poster

00:05:55.410 --> 00:05:57.820
child for a radical
sounding proposal

00:05:57.820 --> 00:06:00.160
to make that kind
of problem go away.

00:06:00.160 --> 00:06:01.940
And then, the third
one is there has

00:06:01.940 --> 00:06:04.570
to be some reason to
believe some breakthrough

00:06:04.570 --> 00:06:07.870
technology, some aha from
science or engineering,

00:06:07.870 --> 00:06:10.840
which makes us believe that,
even if it's not guaranteed

00:06:10.840 --> 00:06:14.870
to work, we have a decent shot
at learning through the process

00:06:14.870 --> 00:06:17.960
and maybe, just
maybe, getting there.

00:06:17.960 --> 00:06:19.554
In the case of
self-driving cars,

00:06:19.554 --> 00:06:20.970
that was the DARPA
Grand Challenge

00:06:20.970 --> 00:06:23.310
work that originally
happened and some advances

00:06:23.310 --> 00:06:25.015
in smart software
and smart sensors.

00:06:27.800 --> 00:06:32.790
So each project that
fits into this mold then

00:06:32.790 --> 00:06:37.520
has to describe not just
that it fits these things,

00:06:37.520 --> 00:06:40.410
but that, in
principle at least, it

00:06:40.410 --> 00:06:44.050
could produce in the long
run a Google scale business

00:06:44.050 --> 00:06:47.920
or Google scale value to
the company in order for us

00:06:47.920 --> 00:06:50.610
to help it move forward.

00:06:50.610 --> 00:06:54.390
Our goal is to have
each of these things

00:06:54.390 --> 00:06:56.480
create a ton of
value for the world,

00:06:56.480 --> 00:06:59.340
but then also create
back to Google

00:06:59.340 --> 00:07:02.440
a fair or equitable
return on its investment

00:07:02.440 --> 00:07:04.590
for taking these big risks.

00:07:04.590 --> 00:07:06.940
And five years in,
I'm very happy to say

00:07:06.940 --> 00:07:10.070
that we've started to make
real progress in this space

00:07:10.070 --> 00:07:12.780
through the graduations
that we've done.

00:07:12.780 --> 00:07:15.400
Some of them play out
in different ways.

00:07:15.400 --> 00:07:18.230
So for example, the massive
neural network project

00:07:18.230 --> 00:07:20.410
that we originally
built at Google X,

00:07:20.410 --> 00:07:24.020
we graduated back into
the main part of Google,

00:07:24.020 --> 00:07:27.310
called knowledge, which is what
you might think of as search.

00:07:27.310 --> 00:07:31.120
And in that part
of Google, it now

00:07:31.120 --> 00:07:35.020
is servicing over 50
products and services helping

00:07:35.020 --> 00:07:38.260
all these different parts
of Google turn signals

00:07:38.260 --> 00:07:41.080
into symbols more
effectively, which is helping

00:07:41.080 --> 00:07:42.510
Google to be successful.

00:07:42.510 --> 00:07:44.859
And certainly, that's
not all our credit

00:07:44.859 --> 00:07:46.650
because they've done
a lot since they left.

00:07:46.650 --> 00:07:48.370
But we helped to get that going.

00:07:48.370 --> 00:07:50.530
And that is a good example
of the sort of thing

00:07:50.530 --> 00:07:51.720
that we're shooting for.

00:07:51.720 --> 00:07:54.810
In a very different way,
the smart contact lens

00:07:54.810 --> 00:07:57.380
work that we built,
it wasn't going

00:07:57.380 --> 00:08:00.070
to probably work out
optimally for us,

00:08:00.070 --> 00:08:02.850
not only to do the original
work on that project,

00:08:02.850 --> 00:08:05.720
but to take it all the way
to the market ourselves.

00:08:05.720 --> 00:08:08.900
So we developed a partnership
with Alcon, the eye care

00:08:08.900 --> 00:08:13.080
division of Novartis, and now
we are headed towards the market

00:08:13.080 --> 00:08:15.430
through this still
very complex process

00:08:15.430 --> 00:08:17.910
of trying to make
contact lenses be

00:08:17.910 --> 00:08:22.120
able to sense the glucose in
your eye to help diabetics

00:08:22.120 --> 00:08:24.470
manage their diabetes better.

00:08:24.470 --> 00:08:26.570
But that is another
example where

00:08:26.570 --> 00:08:29.660
value can be released through
this work, in this case,

00:08:29.660 --> 00:08:31.940
through a partner.

00:08:31.940 --> 00:08:34.730
Another of the critical
operating principles

00:08:34.730 --> 00:08:38.169
that we have at Google X
is throwing ourselves out

00:08:38.169 --> 00:08:41.679
into the world to get
contact with the real world

00:08:41.679 --> 00:08:42.835
as fast as possible.

00:08:45.480 --> 00:08:48.450
It's not sometimes a
natural thing to do,

00:08:48.450 --> 00:08:50.530
but it is an absolute
critical thing

00:08:50.530 --> 00:08:54.000
to do, especially when
you're taking on particularly

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:55.300
big, hard projects.

00:08:55.300 --> 00:08:58.640
You can't possibly know at
beginning the right thing

00:08:58.640 --> 00:09:01.890
to do, but you can
have a process where

00:09:01.890 --> 00:09:04.890
you discover faster, rather
than slower, that you're

00:09:04.890 --> 00:09:06.670
on the wrong track.

00:09:06.670 --> 00:09:08.140
That, you can do.

00:09:08.140 --> 00:09:11.240
So we go through these
processes for things

00:09:11.240 --> 00:09:14.820
like the self-driving cars,
for our flying wind turbines,

00:09:14.820 --> 00:09:18.390
for Project Loon, for
contact lens work that we do,

00:09:18.390 --> 00:09:19.620
and for others.

00:09:19.620 --> 00:09:24.380
We go through this process
where we force ourselves

00:09:24.380 --> 00:09:26.370
to seek out this contact.

00:09:26.370 --> 00:09:30.970
And sometimes, this turns out to
be us dragging our balloons up

00:09:30.970 --> 00:09:34.990
to South Dakota to expose
the balloons to Arctic winds.

00:09:34.990 --> 00:09:38.970
Sometimes, it's asking a
really specific tiny question,

00:09:38.970 --> 00:09:42.600
like how long will
this glucose sensor

00:09:42.600 --> 00:09:45.350
the size of a piece
of glitter actually

00:09:45.350 --> 00:09:49.340
be able to sense glucose while
sitting in this tear fluid.

00:09:49.340 --> 00:09:52.500
The question is how
and how fast can you

00:09:52.500 --> 00:09:54.460
discover that what
you're working on

00:09:54.460 --> 00:09:57.210
is the wrong thing
to be working on.

00:09:57.210 --> 00:10:00.020
And the secret is
it's discouraging

00:10:00.020 --> 00:10:01.420
to hear these things.

00:10:01.420 --> 00:10:05.580
We all avoid going
out into the world,

00:10:05.580 --> 00:10:08.740
throwing ourselves at the
world to discover these things.

00:10:08.740 --> 00:10:10.310
But no matter how
discouraging it

00:10:10.310 --> 00:10:14.050
is now, if you put more
time into doing it,

00:10:14.050 --> 00:10:18.480
you will unconsciously avoid
even more doing it tomorrow,

00:10:18.480 --> 00:10:20.590
or a week from now,
or a month from now.

00:10:20.590 --> 00:10:23.520
And that's why doing
it as fast as you can

00:10:23.520 --> 00:10:26.800
is actually the easiest time
and the most efficient time

00:10:26.800 --> 00:10:28.830
to discover that you're
on the wrong path.

00:10:28.830 --> 00:10:32.810
And that's why it is sort of
central to how Google X works

00:10:32.810 --> 00:10:35.930
on solving these problems.

00:10:35.930 --> 00:10:39.200
I want to emphasize--
what this basically

00:10:39.200 --> 00:10:41.280
means is we don't know.

00:10:41.280 --> 00:10:43.800
And I would go so far
so to say, nobody really

00:10:43.800 --> 00:10:49.510
knows the right way to
build any of these projects.

00:10:49.510 --> 00:10:51.340
If you listen to
the media stories,

00:10:51.340 --> 00:10:56.440
you get this nice, tight arc
where the entrepreneurs that

00:10:56.440 --> 00:10:58.207
make it were
destined to make it,

00:10:58.207 --> 00:11:00.540
and the ones that didn't work
were losers who were never

00:11:00.540 --> 00:11:02.050
going to make it anyway.

00:11:02.050 --> 00:11:04.140
And it completely
misses the point,

00:11:04.140 --> 00:11:07.184
that feeling in the
pit of your stomach

00:11:07.184 --> 00:11:08.850
where you know where
you want to get to,

00:11:08.850 --> 00:11:11.640
but you really don't
know how to get there.

00:11:11.640 --> 00:11:14.330
I have those feelings
all the time.

00:11:14.330 --> 00:11:17.160
Every single one of our
project leads at Google X

00:11:17.160 --> 00:11:18.940
has those feelings.

00:11:18.940 --> 00:11:20.270
You're not alone.

00:11:20.270 --> 00:11:22.480
That's just the
truth of the world

00:11:22.480 --> 00:11:25.270
that we have those
feelings all the time.

00:11:25.270 --> 00:11:28.320
All we can do is take
our best guess about what

00:11:28.320 --> 00:11:29.400
we should be building.

00:11:29.400 --> 00:11:30.650
And then, don't wait.

00:11:30.650 --> 00:11:33.280
Get quickly out into
the world to discover

00:11:33.280 --> 00:11:35.942
how wrong you are, which
parts are salvageable,

00:11:35.942 --> 00:11:37.400
and which parts
you need to go back

00:11:37.400 --> 00:11:39.020
to the drawing board about.

00:11:39.020 --> 00:11:41.867
That's the only way
to race forward.

00:11:41.867 --> 00:11:43.450
So I'm going to tell
you about Project

00:11:43.450 --> 00:11:47.190
Wing as an example of this.

00:11:47.190 --> 00:11:49.825
Project Wing had some
kind of bumpy months--

00:11:49.825 --> 00:11:56.520
some very bumpy months
in late 2013, early 2014.

00:11:56.520 --> 00:11:59.890
So the goal for Project
Wing is self-flying vehicles

00:11:59.890 --> 00:12:01.700
for delivery.

00:12:01.700 --> 00:12:05.230
That huge problem with the
world that we aspire to,

00:12:05.230 --> 00:12:08.070
we believe that there are
still a significant amount

00:12:08.070 --> 00:12:11.220
of friction in how physical
things are moved around

00:12:11.220 --> 00:12:12.410
in the physical world.

00:12:12.410 --> 00:12:15.720
And if you look, historically,
at the Pony Express

00:12:15.720 --> 00:12:17.760
and the introduction
of the post office,

00:12:17.760 --> 00:12:20.120
at mail order catalogs--
which are kind of weirdly

00:12:20.120 --> 00:12:22.870
the precursor to ecommerce
on the internet-- If you look

00:12:22.870 --> 00:12:27.450
at boats, planes, trains, every
time people have introduced

00:12:27.450 --> 00:12:30.080
a way to more efficiently
move physical things around

00:12:30.080 --> 00:12:34.090
in the world, it has utterly and
positively changed the world.

00:12:34.090 --> 00:12:37.980
There's lots of friction left,
let's remove some more of it.

00:12:37.980 --> 00:12:41.092
But that's too hard to work
on, to get your arms around

00:12:41.092 --> 00:12:41.800
at the beginning.

00:12:41.800 --> 00:12:42.950
It's just too much.

00:12:42.950 --> 00:12:45.450
So we had to pick
something to start with.

00:12:45.450 --> 00:12:47.780
There was a process
of brainstorming.

00:12:47.780 --> 00:12:50.240
And the thing that we got
excited about at the beginning

00:12:50.240 --> 00:12:53.120
was to deliver
defibrillators to people.

00:12:53.120 --> 00:12:55.530
So if somebody is having a
heart attack-- you've probably

00:12:55.530 --> 00:12:58.279
seen like an ER show,
they say, clear.

00:12:58.279 --> 00:12:59.320
And they hit their chest.

00:12:59.320 --> 00:13:02.710
And the guy wakes
up again, hopefully.

00:13:02.710 --> 00:13:06.000
So there is in this
building, I guarantee you,

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:09.570
like five AEDSes, Automatic
External Defibrillators.

00:13:09.570 --> 00:13:12.150
I bet you not a single person
in this room knows where it is.

00:13:12.150 --> 00:13:14.320
And if somebody fell down
on the floor right now,

00:13:14.320 --> 00:13:17.190
I doubt you anyone would find
it in the next 5 to 10 minutes,

00:13:17.190 --> 00:13:18.770
sadly.

00:13:18.770 --> 00:13:21.340
What if defibrillators
could come

00:13:21.340 --> 00:13:24.140
find you-- at least get to
the front of the building,

00:13:24.140 --> 00:13:27.200
maybe even get all the way
to the person who needed it.

00:13:27.200 --> 00:13:28.680
So this was our vision.

00:13:28.680 --> 00:13:29.820
It's small.

00:13:29.820 --> 00:13:31.737
And it's something
where time matters.

00:13:31.737 --> 00:13:33.820
It's about eight to nine
minutes from when someone

00:13:33.820 --> 00:13:35.930
has a heart attack
to when they actually

00:13:35.930 --> 00:13:37.480
get help, today on average.

00:13:37.480 --> 00:13:40.350
If we could shave four
minutes off of that time,

00:13:40.350 --> 00:13:44.520
we would save 20,000 lives
a year just in the US.

00:13:44.520 --> 00:13:47.030
So the team got really
excited about this.

00:13:47.030 --> 00:13:47.930
That's a mission.

00:13:47.930 --> 00:13:51.620
That's a great beachhead
mission for this bigger goal.

00:13:51.620 --> 00:13:53.590
So we started two
things in parallel.

00:13:53.590 --> 00:13:55.500
The engineers, all
psyched up because they

00:13:55.500 --> 00:13:57.050
were going to save
all these lives,

00:13:57.050 --> 00:13:59.860
started building a first
version, or a vehicle,

00:13:59.860 --> 00:14:01.900
which by the way--
this turns out

00:14:01.900 --> 00:14:03.260
not to be the right vehicle.

00:14:03.260 --> 00:14:04.380
Story for another day.

00:14:04.380 --> 00:14:06.675
But that was another
failure mode that we had.

00:14:06.675 --> 00:14:08.550
And we're now doing a
very different vehicle.

00:14:08.550 --> 00:14:11.680
That was a painful
moment for the engineers.

00:14:11.680 --> 00:14:15.540
But while they were building
the hardware, the software,

00:14:15.540 --> 00:14:19.350
the sensors for these
vehicles, we also immediately

00:14:19.350 --> 00:14:22.920
had a real world team
that went out to ask,

00:14:22.920 --> 00:14:25.690
can we kill this project
right now, or at least

00:14:25.690 --> 00:14:29.190
that direction for the project,
by finding out that there was

00:14:29.190 --> 00:14:30.730
something wrong with the plan.

00:14:30.730 --> 00:14:32.690
We went out and we
talked to people,

00:14:32.690 --> 00:14:35.210
actually had them,
on dummies, use

00:14:35.210 --> 00:14:37.140
these automatic
external defibrillators.

00:14:37.140 --> 00:14:39.800
We went and we talked to the
emergency response people

00:14:39.800 --> 00:14:40.670
in communities.

00:14:40.670 --> 00:14:43.260
We literally sat and watched
them take phone calls

00:14:43.260 --> 00:14:46.930
and talk to the person who ran
the 911 center in various towns

00:14:46.930 --> 00:14:50.030
and said, well, could we
plug into what you're doing.

00:14:50.030 --> 00:14:52.100
And we quickly found
out the whole plan

00:14:52.100 --> 00:14:54.040
wasn't going to work.

00:14:54.040 --> 00:14:55.080
That's good though.

00:14:55.080 --> 00:14:57.670
I promise you, this was
enormously depressing

00:14:57.670 --> 00:15:00.860
for the team, but it was only
going to be depressing for them

00:15:00.860 --> 00:15:02.510
in a much bigger
way if we'd let them

00:15:02.510 --> 00:15:05.180
go for another year and a
half til they were all done,

00:15:05.180 --> 00:15:07.600
and then, discovered that it
was the wrong thing to do.

00:15:07.600 --> 00:15:10.197
That would have been much more
expensive, much more painful.

00:15:10.197 --> 00:15:12.030
It turned out that it
wasn't the right thing

00:15:12.030 --> 00:15:15.250
to do because number
one, the defibrillators

00:15:15.250 --> 00:15:17.160
are quite hard to use.

00:15:17.160 --> 00:15:18.950
In principle, they're
not, but most people

00:15:18.950 --> 00:15:20.920
don't apply them really well.

00:15:20.920 --> 00:15:22.670
So if you get someone
something they

00:15:22.670 --> 00:15:24.380
don't know how to
use really quickly,

00:15:24.380 --> 00:15:25.838
you actually haven't
made the world

00:15:25.838 --> 00:15:27.410
as better as you were hoping.

00:15:27.410 --> 00:15:31.040
And the other one is that
911 is just not set up

00:15:31.040 --> 00:15:33.910
to let us start flying
to where the call came

00:15:33.910 --> 00:15:35.827
from the moment
they get the call.

00:15:35.827 --> 00:15:38.160
In fact, you would be surprised
how much they don't even

00:15:38.160 --> 00:15:40.150
understand where
the call comes from.

00:15:40.150 --> 00:15:42.820
It's a somewhat
antiquated system.

00:15:42.820 --> 00:15:45.950
So it just wasn't a good plan,
and this was really depressing

00:15:45.950 --> 00:15:47.330
for the team.

00:15:47.330 --> 00:15:49.240
The team took a big step back.

00:15:49.240 --> 00:15:51.590
Initially, we were
trying to figure out what

00:15:51.590 --> 00:15:53.319
a better beachhead would be.

00:15:53.319 --> 00:15:55.360
And we came to what I
think was the right answer.

00:15:55.360 --> 00:15:57.565
This is about 9, 10
months ago where we said,

00:15:57.565 --> 00:15:59.690
you know what, we're not
going to pick a beachhead.

00:15:59.690 --> 00:16:02.510
Instead, let's just throw
ourselves into the world.

00:16:02.510 --> 00:16:06.070
And we went to Australia and
we started doing deliveries.

00:16:06.070 --> 00:16:08.240
And we discovered
things in that process.

00:16:08.240 --> 00:16:10.520
We discovered a ton of
things in that process.

00:16:10.520 --> 00:16:12.340
But among other
things, we discovered

00:16:12.340 --> 00:16:15.850
things people wanted delivered
that we hadn't even imagined.

00:16:15.850 --> 00:16:17.680
Cattle ranchers
were saying to us,

00:16:17.680 --> 00:16:20.830
do you know what would
be awesome is vaccines.

00:16:20.830 --> 00:16:22.170
We're out in the field.

00:16:22.170 --> 00:16:24.390
The vaccines have to be
stored in a refrigerator,

00:16:24.390 --> 00:16:26.150
so we never have them with us.

00:16:26.150 --> 00:16:27.950
They have a really
poor shelf life,

00:16:27.950 --> 00:16:30.570
so we often don't even
have them in our barns.

00:16:30.570 --> 00:16:32.987
But you want it like right
there, that's when you need it.

00:16:32.987 --> 00:16:35.278
If something could just come
in the middle of the field

00:16:35.278 --> 00:16:37.780
and hand me the vaccine, that
would be amazing for the cows

00:16:37.780 --> 00:16:38.946
that they're taking care of.

00:16:38.946 --> 00:16:41.380
We would never have
figured that out sitting

00:16:41.380 --> 00:16:43.550
in a conference room on a
whiteboard, I promise you.

00:16:46.330 --> 00:16:49.350
So Project Loon.

00:16:49.350 --> 00:16:53.940
The goal for Project
Loon is to beam internet

00:16:53.940 --> 00:16:57.410
down to the four billion
people in the world who

00:16:57.410 --> 00:17:00.060
do not currently have
a good connection

00:17:00.060 --> 00:17:01.730
to the digital world.

00:17:01.730 --> 00:17:03.380
Four billion people.

00:17:03.380 --> 00:17:06.359
It's sort of hard to imagine
something more worth working on

00:17:06.359 --> 00:17:07.859
than that.

00:17:07.859 --> 00:17:10.500
And most of these people,
surprisingly by the way,

00:17:10.500 --> 00:17:12.170
already have the device.

00:17:12.170 --> 00:17:14.900
More than half of them
already have a device.

00:17:14.900 --> 00:17:18.240
It's actually the absence of the
connection to the digital world

00:17:18.240 --> 00:17:22.300
which is stymieing their ability
to participate in modern life

00:17:22.300 --> 00:17:26.700
and to get access to better
health outcomes, literacy,

00:17:26.700 --> 00:17:30.980
the ability to vote,
lots of other things.

00:17:30.980 --> 00:17:33.690
So when we started
because the idea was

00:17:33.690 --> 00:17:35.690
to do this from
stratospherically

00:17:35.690 --> 00:17:39.910
based balloons-- so this
is 60,000 to 90,000 feet,

00:17:39.910 --> 00:17:43.020
much up above where the
weather is and up above were

00:17:43.020 --> 00:17:43.690
airplanes fly.

00:17:43.690 --> 00:17:47.370
We were going to put thousands
of these balloons, which

00:17:47.370 --> 00:17:49.079
you can think of like
flying cell towers.

00:17:49.079 --> 00:17:50.494
And they would
talk to each other.

00:17:50.494 --> 00:17:52.000
And they would
beam internet down

00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:57.220
to cell phones, or laptops,
or whatever on the ground.

00:17:57.220 --> 00:17:59.816
We knew we had a lot to
learn because we had not

00:17:59.816 --> 00:18:01.190
spent-- truthfully,
almost nobody

00:18:01.190 --> 00:18:04.770
has spent any meaningful time
hovering up in that area.

00:18:04.770 --> 00:18:09.960
But we misestimated how
much we had to learn.

00:18:09.960 --> 00:18:12.510
So one of the things that was
a basic part of our plan--

00:18:12.510 --> 00:18:14.910
it's called the stratosphere
because the winds go

00:18:14.910 --> 00:18:16.880
at different speeds and
different directions

00:18:16.880 --> 00:18:18.100
quite close to each other.

00:18:18.100 --> 00:18:19.750
It is stratified.

00:18:19.750 --> 00:18:22.680
And this is a big deal for
us, a good deal for us,

00:18:22.680 --> 00:18:24.805
because we want the balloons
to go up and down just

00:18:24.805 --> 00:18:27.179
a little bit because it doesn't
take much energy to cause

00:18:27.179 --> 00:18:28.150
them to go up and down.

00:18:28.150 --> 00:18:30.620
And then they can catch winds
going in different directions

00:18:30.620 --> 00:18:31.810
and at different speeds.

00:18:31.810 --> 00:18:33.340
And so we can
teach the balloons.

00:18:33.340 --> 00:18:36.800
We have taught the balloons
to sail on those winds.

00:18:36.800 --> 00:18:38.990
What we did not
fully anticipate,

00:18:38.990 --> 00:18:42.820
once we got up there, was, if
you have winds going like this

00:18:42.820 --> 00:18:45.090
and winds going like
that, and your balloon is

00:18:45.090 --> 00:18:48.090
the size of a house, when
it crosses that boundary,

00:18:48.090 --> 00:18:50.250
it gets whipped around.

00:18:50.250 --> 00:18:53.090
And the violence
of that process,

00:18:53.090 --> 00:18:55.210
every time we went
through these layers

00:18:55.210 --> 00:18:57.010
was something we
really hadn't properly

00:18:57.010 --> 00:18:58.420
designed into the balloon.

00:18:58.420 --> 00:19:00.890
And there was a major
redesign process

00:19:00.890 --> 00:19:02.710
to make sure that
it was ruggedized

00:19:02.710 --> 00:19:06.340
to survive those
particular kinds of things.

00:19:06.340 --> 00:19:10.840
Even after that, we
were flying balloons

00:19:10.840 --> 00:19:14.620
and our goal was to get them
to stay up for 100 days.

00:19:14.620 --> 00:19:17.760
Our modeling of how this
could turn into a Google scale

00:19:17.760 --> 00:19:20.240
business told us that,
on average, these things

00:19:20.240 --> 00:19:22.180
needed to last 100
days in order for this

00:19:22.180 --> 00:19:24.670
to be a viable business.

00:19:24.670 --> 00:19:27.150
So at first, they
would go up, they

00:19:27.150 --> 00:19:29.439
would explode after five
hours, and come down.

00:19:29.439 --> 00:19:31.105
So we could learn
pretty quickly that we

00:19:31.105 --> 00:19:32.257
were on the wrong track.

00:19:32.257 --> 00:19:34.590
It was kind of a mess though
because, when it came down,

00:19:34.590 --> 00:19:37.230
you didn't necessarily
knew why it blew up.

00:19:37.230 --> 00:19:39.730
It just sort of pops.

00:19:39.730 --> 00:19:41.960
These things are full of helium.

00:19:41.960 --> 00:19:44.760
But after a while, once
we solved those problems,

00:19:44.760 --> 00:19:47.120
our success became an
even bigger problem

00:19:47.120 --> 00:19:48.890
because they would
leak really slowly.

00:19:48.890 --> 00:19:50.060
We would wait a week.

00:19:50.060 --> 00:19:51.470
We would wait three weeks.

00:19:51.470 --> 00:19:52.900
Then it would start leaking.

00:19:52.900 --> 00:19:55.990
It would take several more weeks
for it to come down in a way

00:19:55.990 --> 00:19:57.870
where we could get
it to come down

00:19:57.870 --> 00:20:00.860
where we could capture it, and
then go send someone to like

00:20:00.860 --> 00:20:04.480
Southern Chile to pick it up.

00:20:04.480 --> 00:20:06.710
This was an incredibly
inefficient way

00:20:06.710 --> 00:20:09.330
to find out that we weren't
doing the right thing.

00:20:09.330 --> 00:20:11.310
We needed to fail faster.

00:20:11.310 --> 00:20:12.420
We were in the real world.

00:20:12.420 --> 00:20:14.003
It was giving us
these signals, but we

00:20:14.003 --> 00:20:17.070
needed to accelerate the
real world in some way.

00:20:17.070 --> 00:20:19.200
So we created, in
this particular case,

00:20:19.200 --> 00:20:21.550
something called a leak squad.

00:20:21.550 --> 00:20:25.600
And their goal was to
create, detect, and then fix

00:20:25.600 --> 00:20:27.460
the leaks that we were having.

00:20:27.460 --> 00:20:30.260
And they studied a
lot of other things

00:20:30.260 --> 00:20:33.920
in the world where people care
about very thin things that

00:20:33.920 --> 00:20:34.420
don't leak.

00:20:34.420 --> 00:20:36.260
And it's important
that they not leak.

00:20:36.260 --> 00:20:40.886
Doritos bags, sausage
casings, condoms.

00:20:40.886 --> 00:20:43.010
There's a lot of work that's
going on in this area.

00:20:43.010 --> 00:20:44.843
All three of those are
important not to leak

00:20:44.843 --> 00:20:47.900
for somewhat different reasons.

00:20:47.900 --> 00:20:53.250
So imagine something the
size of a house rubbing soap

00:20:53.250 --> 00:20:55.770
over it, and then, filling
it so full of helium

00:20:55.770 --> 00:20:57.540
that somewhere the
leak would begin.

00:20:57.540 --> 00:21:00.260
And then looking around
it for little bubbles.

00:21:00.260 --> 00:21:02.290
Or having a wand,
about this big,

00:21:02.290 --> 00:21:03.884
which is a helium detector.

00:21:03.884 --> 00:21:05.300
And kind of like
a metal detector,

00:21:05.300 --> 00:21:08.247
it would go eee if it
could smell the helium.

00:21:08.247 --> 00:21:10.080
And then waving this
thing around this thing

00:21:10.080 --> 00:21:11.579
the size of a house
while you've got

00:21:11.579 --> 00:21:13.420
it overpressurized
with helium, trying

00:21:13.420 --> 00:21:15.390
to get it to leak so
we could find the leak.

00:21:15.390 --> 00:21:18.470
Then we could redesign how
the balloon was structured.

00:21:18.470 --> 00:21:22.120
Or taking it, as I mentioned
before, to South Dakota.

00:21:22.120 --> 00:21:24.910
There's like this weird polar
vortex where Santa Claus

00:21:24.910 --> 00:21:25.870
weather had come down.

00:21:25.870 --> 00:21:28.950
It was like minus 40,
minus 50 degrees below zero

00:21:28.950 --> 00:21:30.052
for a couple weeks there.

00:21:30.052 --> 00:21:31.760
And that was good
because that's actually

00:21:31.760 --> 00:21:33.790
the temperature it is
most of the time up

00:21:33.790 --> 00:21:35.780
in the stratosphere.

00:21:35.780 --> 00:21:38.910
So most of the
stuff did not work.

00:21:38.910 --> 00:21:43.340
But we did find several
really important things.

00:21:43.340 --> 00:21:47.170
One of my favorite is that
in the manufacturing process,

00:21:47.170 --> 00:21:51.430
the balloons are so big that we
have to stand on them in order

00:21:51.430 --> 00:21:52.870
to make them.

00:21:52.870 --> 00:21:54.690
And so someone brought
up the question,

00:21:54.690 --> 00:21:56.940
I wonder if them
walking on the balloons

00:21:56.940 --> 00:21:59.340
is what's causing
some of the weeks.

00:21:59.340 --> 00:22:01.210
And so we did a test.

00:22:01.210 --> 00:22:02.490
Everything's an experiment.

00:22:02.490 --> 00:22:05.000
Failing is fine as long
as you set everything up

00:22:05.000 --> 00:22:07.710
as an experiment
with a hypothesis.

00:22:07.710 --> 00:22:11.980
So the hypothesis here was are
their feet making little holes?

00:22:11.980 --> 00:22:15.300
So the control group was
them standing on the balloons

00:22:15.300 --> 00:22:17.730
the way they were, which is
wearing their normal socks.

00:22:17.730 --> 00:22:20.620
And then we got some
really fluffy socks.

00:22:20.620 --> 00:22:22.560
But we need to control
the experiment.

00:22:22.560 --> 00:22:27.140
So we actually had a line dance,
like a can can line dance.

00:22:27.140 --> 00:22:29.080
And we had all these
manufacturing guys

00:22:29.080 --> 00:22:32.090
on the balloon doing the line
dance in their normal socks.

00:22:32.090 --> 00:22:33.649
And then we got another balloon.

00:22:33.649 --> 00:22:35.690
And we had them all put
on their big fluffy socks

00:22:35.690 --> 00:22:37.540
and do the same line dance.

00:22:37.540 --> 00:22:39.960
And in fact, it turned
out that the balloon

00:22:39.960 --> 00:22:44.290
with the fluffy socks
had fewer leaks in it.

00:22:44.290 --> 00:22:46.620
It is literally at
that level that we've

00:22:46.620 --> 00:22:49.660
had to push the real
world towards us

00:22:49.660 --> 00:22:52.710
so we can fail quickly, so we
can discover, so we can fix it.

00:22:56.510 --> 00:23:00.710
I really believe Loon has
made unbelievable progress.

00:23:00.710 --> 00:23:02.610
It hasn't even been
four years yet,

00:23:02.610 --> 00:23:05.960
and they've moved from this
crazy sounding science project

00:23:05.960 --> 00:23:07.650
to a viable venture.

00:23:07.650 --> 00:23:10.780
Our balloons now stay up, by the
way, for more than six months

00:23:10.780 --> 00:23:12.090
at a time.

00:23:12.090 --> 00:23:14.310
And we can sail them
around the world

00:23:14.310 --> 00:23:19.120
to within 500 yards of where
we want them to go, routinely.

00:23:19.120 --> 00:23:20.670
That they've made
that progress is

00:23:20.670 --> 00:23:23.510
because they've been
so hungry to fail,

00:23:23.510 --> 00:23:26.250
because they've been so hungry
to get into the real world

00:23:26.250 --> 00:23:29.070
and to try things.

00:23:29.070 --> 00:23:32.160
Maybe more than any other
project that we have,

00:23:32.160 --> 00:23:35.400
the self-driving cars have
to get into the real world

00:23:35.400 --> 00:23:37.120
in order to do their learning.

00:23:37.120 --> 00:23:40.110
It's just the way it's wired.

00:23:40.110 --> 00:23:41.750
And of course,
when we started, we

00:23:41.750 --> 00:23:45.200
couldn't possibly
know the 10,000 things

00:23:45.200 --> 00:23:47.910
that we would need to do
right in order for a car

00:23:47.910 --> 00:23:52.520
to drive itself really well
because pretty good most

00:23:52.520 --> 00:23:54.630
of the time is not
good enough when you

00:23:54.630 --> 00:23:56.920
get into a self-driving car.

00:23:56.920 --> 00:23:58.690
But we couldn't know
what that list was.

00:23:58.690 --> 00:24:00.481
We weren't going to
sit on some white board

00:24:00.481 --> 00:24:04.650
and write down the 10,000 weird
situations that would happen.

00:24:04.650 --> 00:24:08.090
So you get out into
the real world.

00:24:08.090 --> 00:24:11.810
And the truth is that the making
of that list of those 10,000

00:24:11.810 --> 00:24:16.220
things is half of all of what's
hard about doing something

00:24:16.220 --> 00:24:19.000
like this, like making a
self-driving car is figuring

00:24:19.000 --> 00:24:23.160
out what the real world
wants to tell you.

00:24:23.160 --> 00:24:29.390
So 2 and a 1/2 years ago--
this was in the fall of 2012,

00:24:29.390 --> 00:24:30.370
we were done.

00:24:30.370 --> 00:24:32.670
We were just done, pretty much.

00:24:32.670 --> 00:24:36.260
We had this great
commute helper.

00:24:36.260 --> 00:24:37.800
We had it on highways.

00:24:37.800 --> 00:24:40.420
It was executing beautifully.

00:24:40.420 --> 00:24:44.870
We were so done that we gave
a bunch of our Lexus vehicles,

00:24:44.870 --> 00:24:46.330
like you can see
in this picture,

00:24:46.330 --> 00:24:48.830
to a bunch of Googlers who
did not work at Google X.

00:24:48.830 --> 00:24:50.800
And we said take
this home with you.

00:24:50.800 --> 00:24:53.420
Use it for your commute.

00:24:53.420 --> 00:24:56.110
You just drive to the
freeway, you push a button,

00:24:56.110 --> 00:24:58.800
it'll take care of the rest.

00:24:58.800 --> 00:25:02.050
Driving on the freeway is
actually not that hard.

00:25:02.050 --> 00:25:03.580
You pretty much
stay in your lane.

00:25:03.580 --> 00:25:05.230
You change lanes occasionally.

00:25:05.230 --> 00:25:07.630
Don't hit the guy
in front of you.

00:25:07.630 --> 00:25:09.504
Occasionally, some
bad driver makes

00:25:09.504 --> 00:25:10.670
things a little interesting.

00:25:10.670 --> 00:25:14.230
But basically, we
had it covered.

00:25:14.230 --> 00:25:15.670
So we gave it to these people.

00:25:15.670 --> 00:25:18.740
And we made them
swear that they were

00:25:18.740 --> 00:25:21.715
going to pay 100% attention
because when we have our safety

00:25:21.715 --> 00:25:23.840
drivers in the car, they're
like hovering like this

00:25:23.840 --> 00:25:25.012
over the steering wheel.

00:25:25.012 --> 00:25:26.720
The car drives for
eight hours at a time,

00:25:26.720 --> 00:25:28.190
and they never touch
the steering wheel,

00:25:28.190 --> 00:25:29.770
but they just have to be
like this the whole time,

00:25:29.770 --> 00:25:31.210
so we were telling
these Googlers,

00:25:31.210 --> 00:25:32.480
you have to do the same thing.

00:25:32.480 --> 00:25:33.990
We're going to put
cameras in the car.

00:25:33.990 --> 00:25:36.210
This is for your commute,
but you got to pay attention.

00:25:36.210 --> 00:25:37.168
Yeah, oh yeah, totally.

00:25:37.168 --> 00:25:41.260
We're going to pay so much
attention you can't believe it.

00:25:41.260 --> 00:25:44.980
The cars, thankfully,
performed flawlessly.

00:25:44.980 --> 00:25:46.020
The people did not.

00:25:49.150 --> 00:25:52.190
People don't even pay
attention to driving

00:25:52.190 --> 00:25:54.690
when they're driving.

00:25:54.690 --> 00:25:58.080
They're like makeup, and the
texting, and the burrito.

00:25:58.080 --> 00:25:59.070
It's horrible.

00:25:59.070 --> 00:26:01.460
And that's when they're
actually supposed to be driving.

00:26:01.460 --> 00:26:04.420
So imagine what they do when
they think the car's mostly

00:26:04.420 --> 00:26:06.330
got it covered, and like
once in a blue moon,

00:26:06.330 --> 00:26:08.260
I'm going to need to take over.

00:26:08.260 --> 00:26:10.250
It was not pretty.

00:26:10.250 --> 00:26:13.760
It was sufficiently not pretty
that we stopped doing it.

00:26:13.760 --> 00:26:17.920
And we said, OK, this
is not going to work.

00:26:17.920 --> 00:26:22.520
Humans cannot be a backup
system for the computer.

00:26:22.520 --> 00:26:29.790
Our success was a failure when
you factored in human nature.

00:26:29.790 --> 00:26:32.592
And so we knew that if there was
going to be a self-driving car,

00:26:32.592 --> 00:26:34.300
it was going to have
to be something that

00:26:34.300 --> 00:26:36.140
could go all the
way from point A

00:26:36.140 --> 00:26:39.840
to point B by itself with
no help from the person.

00:26:43.020 --> 00:26:48.020
This was a major existential
moment for this team.

00:26:48.020 --> 00:26:49.820
They thought they were done.

00:26:49.820 --> 00:26:52.150
And now all of a sudden,
they weren't just not done,

00:26:52.150 --> 00:26:53.920
it wasn't just like
a half step back.

00:26:53.920 --> 00:26:56.480
They were like, is
this even possible?

00:26:56.480 --> 00:26:58.920
This is 2 and a 1/2 years ago.

00:26:58.920 --> 00:27:01.890
The first thing was there was
like this frantic brainstorming

00:27:01.890 --> 00:27:04.700
about how we could force
people to always pay attention

00:27:04.700 --> 00:27:08.760
to the road because then we'd
be like fixed, like training

00:27:08.760 --> 00:27:09.470
wheels.

00:27:09.470 --> 00:27:11.720
And it quickly became clear
that was not the right way

00:27:11.720 --> 00:27:14.350
to solve the problem.

00:27:14.350 --> 00:27:18.480
So after quite a bit of
emotional process and soul

00:27:18.480 --> 00:27:21.610
searching, the team
did what I now believe

00:27:21.610 --> 00:27:23.260
is exactly the right thing.

00:27:23.260 --> 00:27:27.480
They said, OK, if humans are
not a reliable backup system

00:27:27.480 --> 00:27:30.270
for the computer,
let's build a car that

00:27:30.270 --> 00:27:31.630
doesn't have a steering wheel.

00:27:31.630 --> 00:27:34.610
Then, we won't be tempted
to use that as a crutch

00:27:34.610 --> 00:27:36.420
when we hit these
parts of the process

00:27:36.420 --> 00:27:37.836
where we don't
know how to handle.

00:27:37.836 --> 00:27:40.140
We won't just pump that
and be like, oh, we'll

00:27:40.140 --> 00:27:42.820
people handle that one.

00:27:42.820 --> 00:27:43.380
So we did.

00:27:43.380 --> 00:27:45.480
We've been doing that
for 2 and a 1/2 years.

00:27:45.480 --> 00:27:48.120
And we just announced
recently that these cars

00:27:48.120 --> 00:27:54.070
will start being on city
streets this summer.

00:27:54.070 --> 00:27:56.430
Super exciting.

00:27:56.430 --> 00:27:59.790
[APPLAUSE]

00:28:03.640 --> 00:28:08.500
At first, they're going to
have this temporary steering

00:28:08.500 --> 00:28:09.020
wheel in it.

00:28:09.020 --> 00:28:11.420
And the safety driver will
just be sitting there.

00:28:11.420 --> 00:28:14.800
But that's the right, safe thing
to do so that we can make sure

00:28:14.800 --> 00:28:17.660
that these cars are doing
what our bigger cars have been

00:28:17.660 --> 00:28:20.470
practicing for a long time
now, which is to always do

00:28:20.470 --> 00:28:23.550
the right thing on these city
streets, which are much more

00:28:23.550 --> 00:28:25.660
complicated than
being on the highway,

00:28:25.660 --> 00:28:28.540
going all the way from
point A to point B.

00:28:28.540 --> 00:28:31.120
There's no way we could have
learned this sort of thing

00:28:31.120 --> 00:28:35.800
without spending a ton of
time out in the real world.

00:28:35.800 --> 00:28:39.480
It's also a priceless
opportunity for us

00:28:39.480 --> 00:28:42.710
to start being in
these city streets

00:28:42.710 --> 00:28:46.020
in a more widespread way.

00:28:46.020 --> 00:28:50.480
I think if the Lexus
vehicles that we had really,

00:28:50.480 --> 00:28:54.670
eventually were to become the
first fully self-driving cars

00:28:54.670 --> 00:28:57.780
on the streets, it could
provoke some anxiety in people.

00:28:57.780 --> 00:28:59.420
And one of the things
that we're hoping

00:28:59.420 --> 00:29:04.230
is that this car, because
it's smaller, it's cuter,

00:29:04.230 --> 00:29:07.450
because it's only going
to go 25 miles an hour,

00:29:07.450 --> 00:29:11.170
because we've actually
built a foam front end

00:29:11.170 --> 00:29:13.420
and flexible windshield
in here-- I hope we never

00:29:13.420 --> 00:29:14.690
have to use it.

00:29:14.690 --> 00:29:17.430
But we get to experiment
with these things,

00:29:17.430 --> 00:29:19.530
and on a bunch of
different fronts,

00:29:19.530 --> 00:29:23.100
make sure as we're learning that
we're keeping the world super,

00:29:23.100 --> 00:29:25.020
super safe.

00:29:25.020 --> 00:29:30.360
So I'm excited to see this
next step for that project.

00:29:30.360 --> 00:29:36.130
Now in order for this to really
be done-- that list of 10,000

00:29:36.130 --> 00:29:40.130
things-- we've become-- the
self-driving car team has

00:29:40.130 --> 00:29:41.890
become part of its own problem.

00:29:41.890 --> 00:29:44.980
We are so good at driving
now on city streets.

00:29:44.980 --> 00:29:49.170
We drive 10,000 miles a
week in Mountain View.

00:29:49.170 --> 00:29:52.040
And nothing happens because the
car just does the right thing

00:29:52.040 --> 00:29:52.630
all the time.

00:29:52.630 --> 00:29:55.126
It is incredibly boring
for the safety drivers.

00:29:55.126 --> 00:29:56.750
It's not very helpful
for the engineers

00:29:56.750 --> 00:29:59.480
either because they aren't
learning much if the cars just

00:29:59.480 --> 00:30:00.397
like, do ta do ta do.

00:30:00.397 --> 00:30:02.230
And they're like, OK,
give it a new address.

00:30:02.230 --> 00:30:03.560
Do ta do ta do.

00:30:03.560 --> 00:30:06.280
We need more negative examples.

00:30:06.280 --> 00:30:10.300
The teams at Google X are hungry
for these negative examples.

00:30:10.300 --> 00:30:12.300
So we've created a team
on the self-driving car

00:30:12.300 --> 00:30:16.200
team whose full time job is to
find creative ways to create

00:30:16.200 --> 00:30:21.110
negative examples under safe
conditions for the cars.

00:30:21.110 --> 00:30:22.890
Now one of the
ways we can do this

00:30:22.890 --> 00:30:24.250
is just by going to new cities.

00:30:24.250 --> 00:30:25.950
And we are starting to do this.

00:30:25.950 --> 00:30:27.954
So for example, coming
to San Francisco,

00:30:27.954 --> 00:30:30.120
there are interesting things
like different whether.

00:30:30.120 --> 00:30:31.980
It's more cloudy here.

00:30:31.980 --> 00:30:35.690
Maybe you get a little bit more
rain, probably not these days.

00:30:35.690 --> 00:30:37.450
We're definitely not
going to get snow.

00:30:37.450 --> 00:30:39.860
But as we move
from city to city,

00:30:39.860 --> 00:30:41.985
we can rack up some
new experiences.

00:30:41.985 --> 00:30:43.860
San Francisco-- one of
the interesting things

00:30:43.860 --> 00:30:44.945
it'll give us is hills.

00:30:44.945 --> 00:30:47.320
It's not that the cars are
going to struggle up the hill.

00:30:47.320 --> 00:30:48.520
They can go up the hills.

00:30:48.520 --> 00:30:50.290
But it's a reasonable question.

00:30:50.290 --> 00:30:54.830
How will the sensors on our
cars have a hard time, or not,

00:30:54.830 --> 00:30:58.250
when we're tilted like this
up a steep San Francisco hill.

00:30:58.250 --> 00:31:00.310
So that's a good
thing for us to learn.

00:31:00.310 --> 00:31:02.320
But that's still not
learning fast enough.

00:31:02.320 --> 00:31:05.490
So this team has been trying
to find more and more ways

00:31:05.490 --> 00:31:07.460
to challenge the cars.

00:31:07.460 --> 00:31:09.990
And the ways in
which we have to find

00:31:09.990 --> 00:31:12.280
these rare, weird
conditions fall into three

00:31:12.280 --> 00:31:16.160
different categories
Situation number one is people

00:31:16.160 --> 00:31:18.260
drive illegally.

00:31:18.260 --> 00:31:20.230
Situation number
two is we just have

00:31:20.230 --> 00:31:22.660
to react suddenly because
people weren't paying attention.

00:31:22.660 --> 00:31:25.860
And then there's
just weird stuff.

00:31:25.860 --> 00:31:29.080
The mail trucks are
jumping out in front of us.

00:31:29.080 --> 00:31:31.410
That's the canonic
version of this.

00:31:31.410 --> 00:31:34.080
And we have tried
thousands of examples

00:31:34.080 --> 00:31:37.190
to simulate that jumping
out in front of us

00:31:37.190 --> 00:31:41.840
just to try to stress our
cars on our test track.

00:31:41.840 --> 00:31:43.850
We throw beach balls at it.

00:31:43.850 --> 00:31:45.680
We've gone to the
Halloween store

00:31:45.680 --> 00:31:50.280
and gotten big birds to swing
by the windshield of the car.

00:31:50.280 --> 00:31:52.990
We've had people
hide in canvas bags

00:31:52.990 --> 00:31:54.730
and pop out in the
middle of the road

00:31:54.730 --> 00:31:56.540
just to see what
the car would do.

00:31:56.540 --> 00:31:59.027
On take your children to
work day, we parked the cars,

00:31:59.027 --> 00:32:01.610
but had the sensors running just
so the kids would play around

00:32:01.610 --> 00:32:04.390
them, so we could
get the computer

00:32:04.390 --> 00:32:08.590
used to watching kids move so
we could learn how they move.

00:32:08.590 --> 00:32:11.200
And the reason that we
could do the following

00:32:11.200 --> 00:32:12.990
is because we did all that.

00:32:12.990 --> 00:32:18.460
A few months ago, we were coming
down a suburban side street.

00:32:18.460 --> 00:32:22.790
The car turned a corner and
came automatically to a stop.

00:32:22.790 --> 00:32:25.260
There was a woman,
an elderly woman

00:32:25.260 --> 00:32:28.270
in an electric wheelchair,
holding a broom,

00:32:28.270 --> 00:32:31.327
in the middle of the road,
trying to shoo a duck out

00:32:31.327 --> 00:32:32.410
of the middle of the road.

00:32:32.410 --> 00:32:34.243
And they were going
around in little circles

00:32:34.243 --> 00:32:35.430
in the middle of the road.

00:32:35.430 --> 00:32:37.250
I'm sure this was
shocking to the car

00:32:37.250 --> 00:32:40.240
as well as well as to
the safety drivers.

00:32:40.240 --> 00:32:42.440
But eventually, she got
the duck out of the road,

00:32:42.440 --> 00:32:46.190
she moved off the street, and
the car continued autonomously.

00:32:46.190 --> 00:32:49.470
That it stopped autonomously
and started autonomously again,

00:32:49.470 --> 00:32:52.282
and there was no problem, is
thanks to these field tests

00:32:52.282 --> 00:32:52.990
that we're doing.

00:32:57.460 --> 00:33:00.440
Getting out and getting into
contact with the real world

00:33:00.440 --> 00:33:06.050
is the most valuable thing
you can do for your project.

00:33:06.050 --> 00:33:09.540
All of our audacious
yearly and quarterly goals

00:33:09.540 --> 00:33:13.200
have this characteristic
of what are

00:33:13.200 --> 00:33:16.100
we going to build, how
are we going to test it

00:33:16.100 --> 00:33:20.160
in the real world, and how are
those tests designed to reveal

00:33:20.160 --> 00:33:23.600
as fast as possible the
unanticipated design

00:33:23.600 --> 00:33:26.040
flaws with what we're building.

00:33:26.040 --> 00:33:28.120
I really believe
that the progress

00:33:28.120 --> 00:33:31.110
of Google X has made
over the last five years

00:33:31.110 --> 00:33:34.640
comes from our excitement
and throwing ourselves

00:33:34.640 --> 00:33:38.570
at the world, of
pursuing these projects

00:33:38.570 --> 00:33:40.690
with the maniacal
focus of a startup,

00:33:40.690 --> 00:33:44.270
and then the being
hungry to be wrong,

00:33:44.270 --> 00:33:46.310
being hungry to make
mistakes, to get

00:33:46.310 --> 00:33:49.010
these negative experiences
and then harness them

00:33:49.010 --> 00:33:51.110
to do it better the next time.

00:33:51.110 --> 00:33:53.640
I know it sounds like a weird
thing to be excited about,

00:33:53.640 --> 00:33:56.650
but I think it's
our special sauce.

00:33:56.650 --> 00:34:00.980
I've always wanted Google X not
just to take its own moonshots,

00:34:00.980 --> 00:34:03.870
but to encourage other
people to think this way,

00:34:03.870 --> 00:34:06.590
to take on some of
these problems, too.

00:34:06.590 --> 00:34:09.440
So even if you're not working
on a self-driving car,

00:34:09.440 --> 00:34:11.960
I hope you can take something
away from this approach

00:34:11.960 --> 00:34:16.010
and set yourself up for
creative, productive, mistake

00:34:16.010 --> 00:34:19.210
filled contact with
the real world.

00:34:19.210 --> 00:34:20.237
Thank you.

00:34:20.237 --> 00:34:24.221
[APPLAUSE]

00:34:32.190 --> 00:34:34.210
I'm happy to take a few
questions if you like.

00:34:34.210 --> 00:34:35.360
There are microphones here.

00:34:48.507 --> 00:34:49.590
AUDIENCE: Is that working?

00:34:49.590 --> 00:34:50.340
ASTRO TELLER: Yes.

00:34:50.340 --> 00:34:51.590
AUDIENCE: There we go.

00:34:51.590 --> 00:34:54.900
So looking at a product
at a typically development

00:34:54.900 --> 00:34:58.800
IT organization and
balancing innovation

00:34:58.800 --> 00:35:02.240
from product management.

00:35:02.240 --> 00:35:04.810
So from a company
who's typically

00:35:04.810 --> 00:35:06.850
focused on building
the next product,

00:35:06.850 --> 00:35:10.232
pounding the sales team lines,
building, building, building,

00:35:10.232 --> 00:35:12.440
do you have any suggestions
or recommendations of how

00:35:12.440 --> 00:35:14.690
to actually put
engineering culture first

00:35:14.690 --> 00:35:16.060
on top of that innovation.

00:35:16.060 --> 00:35:19.470
Is it just a matter of saying,
OK, let's put you guys aside.

00:35:19.470 --> 00:35:20.500
Let's insulate you.

00:35:20.500 --> 00:35:22.230
Is there an insulation
process in that,

00:35:22.230 --> 00:35:25.000
inside of the heavily
driven, product management,

00:35:25.000 --> 00:35:26.290
sales driven company?

00:35:28.369 --> 00:35:30.660
ASTRO TELLER: I'm not sure
this is the answer you want.

00:35:30.660 --> 00:35:33.290
It's a weird thing to say
at a developers conference.

00:35:33.290 --> 00:35:37.150
I don't think an engineering
heavy approach is

00:35:37.150 --> 00:35:40.370
any better than a sales
heavy driven approach.

00:35:40.370 --> 00:35:43.490
I think any company
that is overweighted

00:35:43.490 --> 00:35:46.170
on any of these things
is missing the point.

00:35:46.170 --> 00:35:48.420
When we look to fail
in the real world,

00:35:48.420 --> 00:35:52.630
we depend equally on
finance, on product managers,

00:35:52.630 --> 00:35:56.020
on designers and UX
people, on engineers.

00:35:56.020 --> 00:35:59.150
Anyone who can find a reason
why we're on the wrong track

00:35:59.150 --> 00:36:01.950
is going to be the super
hero of the month for us.

00:36:01.950 --> 00:36:04.190
And so I guess
what I would say is

00:36:04.190 --> 00:36:06.440
rather than trying to
isolate engineering

00:36:06.440 --> 00:36:08.740
from these pressures,
what I would try to do

00:36:08.740 --> 00:36:12.270
is evangelize to them
that they're missing

00:36:12.270 --> 00:36:14.250
half of their opportunities.

00:36:14.250 --> 00:36:16.280
And that if they think
about it as discovering

00:36:16.280 --> 00:36:19.000
as fast as possible why
what we're currently doing

00:36:19.000 --> 00:36:21.790
isn't the right thing to do,
that's the most efficient way

00:36:21.790 --> 00:36:22.880
to make progress.

00:36:22.880 --> 00:36:26.010
And cutting off some
of the reasons why it

00:36:26.010 --> 00:36:27.106
might be a bad reason.

00:36:27.106 --> 00:36:28.980
If you know that it
breaks the law of physics

00:36:28.980 --> 00:36:31.835
and you're not allowed to say
so, your company is broken

00:36:31.835 --> 00:36:33.450
and it's wasting its money.

00:36:33.450 --> 00:36:36.310
And surely like the sales people
are like, yeah, that's true.

00:36:36.310 --> 00:36:39.330
Then you can say, then,
invite me to the meetings.

00:36:39.330 --> 00:36:40.640
Yeah

00:36:40.640 --> 00:36:43.270
AUDIENCE: I just had a question
about the self-driving car.

00:36:43.270 --> 00:36:45.520
I think there was a quote
from Elon Musk or something.

00:36:45.520 --> 00:36:47.970
He was saying sort of
what you said, right?

00:36:47.970 --> 00:36:49.620
Freeway speeds are easy.

00:36:49.620 --> 00:36:51.740
0 to 35 range is easy.

00:36:51.740 --> 00:36:54.350
But it's that 35, to
say, 55 mile an hour

00:36:54.350 --> 00:36:57.420
zone where you can't
simply stop, right?

00:36:57.420 --> 00:36:59.990
And a lot of crazy
things can happen.

00:36:59.990 --> 00:37:02.440
So I guess I'm just
curious to hear

00:37:02.440 --> 00:37:04.990
what the testing you
do in that range is

00:37:04.990 --> 00:37:07.540
and what your experiences are.

00:37:11.020 --> 00:37:15.230
ASTRO TELLER: Look none
of it's easy, to be fair.

00:37:15.230 --> 00:37:20.380
The highways are very
constrained situations.

00:37:20.380 --> 00:37:22.480
There are some
oddities that happen,

00:37:22.480 --> 00:37:24.640
but a microscopic
fraction of the oddities

00:37:24.640 --> 00:37:26.310
that happen on city streets.

00:37:26.310 --> 00:37:29.050
So that's partly about speed.

00:37:29.050 --> 00:37:31.340
Part of the issue,
which is some of what

00:37:31.340 --> 00:37:35.110
Elon is getting at there is
that the energy of the car, m v

00:37:35.110 --> 00:37:35.900
squared.

00:37:35.900 --> 00:37:38.850
When you double the velocity
of the car, you get four times

00:37:38.850 --> 00:37:41.460
the energy, four times
the braking distance,

00:37:41.460 --> 00:37:44.210
it does complicate things
when you're going faster.

00:37:44.210 --> 00:37:47.830
Our experience has been
with that going slower

00:37:47.830 --> 00:37:50.000
will help from a
safety perspective.

00:37:50.000 --> 00:37:52.910
That's part of why we're
focused on 25 miles an hour

00:37:52.910 --> 00:37:54.900
and under for the moment.

00:37:54.900 --> 00:37:58.540
But what I would highlight
is the really hard bits

00:37:58.540 --> 00:38:02.490
of this are the duck.

00:38:02.490 --> 00:38:06.100
When someone walks out into
the street holding a stop sign,

00:38:06.100 --> 00:38:10.180
like a crossing guard,
that's a legal stop sign.

00:38:10.180 --> 00:38:12.100
The car has to figure that out.

00:38:12.100 --> 00:38:15.690
Figuring out the 10,000
things like that.

00:38:15.690 --> 00:38:18.240
When a bike is
coming the wrong way

00:38:18.240 --> 00:38:23.420
down a bike lane, which should
dominate in the computer's way

00:38:23.420 --> 00:38:25.020
of approaching that problem?

00:38:25.020 --> 00:38:28.040
The fact that they should
be going that way, and bikes

00:38:28.040 --> 00:38:30.550
tend to be going that way,
or the physical reality

00:38:30.550 --> 00:38:32.950
that its momentum is this way.

00:38:32.950 --> 00:38:35.340
Those 10,000 things--
my experience--

00:38:35.340 --> 00:38:37.630
are the really hard things.

00:38:37.630 --> 00:38:38.250
Yeah.

00:38:38.250 --> 00:38:40.440
AUDIENCE: How would
you characterize

00:38:40.440 --> 00:38:42.820
Google X's experience
when bringing Google Glass

00:38:42.820 --> 00:38:45.386
into the real world?

00:38:45.386 --> 00:38:47.010
ASTRO TELLER: So I've
said this before.

00:38:47.010 --> 00:38:49.320
So first of all,
Google Glass, I think,

00:38:49.320 --> 00:38:50.620
is making really good progress.

00:38:50.620 --> 00:38:55.910
It's graduated from Google X
to Tony Fidel's part of Google.

00:38:55.910 --> 00:39:00.690
And we will be hearing more
in the future about that.

00:39:00.690 --> 00:39:04.760
But I think we did something
right and something wrong.

00:39:04.760 --> 00:39:07.260
The thing that we did right,
that I would absolutely

00:39:07.260 --> 00:39:12.200
do again, is getting it out into
the world, and in some ways,

00:39:12.200 --> 00:39:14.100
even in the way we got
it out into the world.

00:39:14.100 --> 00:39:16.850
The Explorer Program was
exactly the right thing to do,

00:39:16.850 --> 00:39:18.560
and we owe a ton to Explorers.

00:39:18.560 --> 00:39:20.550
Thank you, if
you're one of them.

00:39:20.550 --> 00:39:26.070
But we were trying to learn
also about the social issues

00:39:26.070 --> 00:39:27.370
around Glass.

00:39:27.370 --> 00:39:30.460
And there were ways in which
by trying to figure out

00:39:30.460 --> 00:39:32.410
how people would
think about Glass,

00:39:32.410 --> 00:39:35.330
we ended up sending signals
that it wasn't a prototype,

00:39:35.330 --> 00:39:37.130
that it was a finished product.

00:39:37.130 --> 00:39:39.120
Things like putting
it on a runway.

00:39:39.120 --> 00:39:41.960
I mean, even that was not
crazy as an experiment

00:39:41.960 --> 00:39:44.940
to see how people would think
about it and respond to it.

00:39:44.940 --> 00:39:46.640
But it did leave
people with the feeling

00:39:46.640 --> 00:39:48.170
that it was a
finished product when

00:39:48.170 --> 00:39:49.790
we weren't productizing it yet.

00:39:49.790 --> 00:39:51.300
We were just trying to learn.

00:39:51.300 --> 00:39:54.410
And I think we left people with
some confusing messages there.

00:39:54.410 --> 00:39:56.425
And that I wish we
had done differently.

00:39:56.425 --> 00:39:57.562
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:39:57.562 --> 00:39:59.770
AUDIENCE: How do you think
about financial resourcing

00:39:59.770 --> 00:40:00.728
each of these products?

00:40:00.728 --> 00:40:02.220
Almost by definition,
a moonshot,

00:40:02.220 --> 00:40:04.460
these could have infinite,
or almost infinite,

00:40:04.460 --> 00:40:05.490
financial resources.

00:40:05.490 --> 00:40:07.340
So how do you decide
which products

00:40:07.340 --> 00:40:09.006
are going to get a
dollar or which one's

00:40:09.006 --> 00:40:11.204
going to get a billion dollars?

00:40:11.204 --> 00:40:12.620
ASTRO TELLER: I'm
not sure I agree

00:40:12.620 --> 00:40:15.510
that you need near infinite
resources for these things.

00:40:15.510 --> 00:40:18.481
That's true only if
you're too shy to say

00:40:18.481 --> 00:40:19.980
for long periods
of time that you're

00:40:19.980 --> 00:40:21.200
working on the wrong thing.

00:40:21.200 --> 00:40:24.969
It's amazing how in
every project when you're

00:40:24.969 --> 00:40:27.510
doing something dumb, when it's
going in the wrong direction,

00:40:27.510 --> 00:40:31.890
I guarantee you 20% or more of
the team knows it within weeks.

00:40:31.890 --> 00:40:32.860
You guys are engineers.

00:40:32.860 --> 00:40:34.484
You know what I'm
talking about, right?

00:40:34.484 --> 00:40:36.170
You know, and no one
will listen to you.

00:40:36.170 --> 00:40:39.080
What if you lived in a culture
where people are like, really.

00:40:39.080 --> 00:40:41.290
Well, let's stop then.

00:40:41.290 --> 00:40:46.120
It's unbelievable how much money
you can save when you do that.

00:40:46.120 --> 00:40:48.032
[APPLAUSE]

00:40:48.032 --> 00:40:48.532
Thanks.

00:40:52.010 --> 00:40:53.945
But just to answer the
rest of your question,

00:40:53.945 --> 00:40:57.710
it is also the case that as
long as we start on a moonshot

00:40:57.710 --> 00:41:00.140
and we believe that there's
a good return on investment

00:41:00.140 --> 00:41:04.150
over some very long period of
time, where a reward to risk

00:41:04.150 --> 00:41:09.550
ratio is good for Google, then
as we go through the process,

00:41:09.550 --> 00:41:11.730
if you're building
this moonshot for us,

00:41:11.730 --> 00:41:14.040
I'm going to have a dialogue
with you about how much

00:41:14.040 --> 00:41:16.270
resources have I given
you and how much have

00:41:16.270 --> 00:41:17.850
you do derisked the project.

00:41:17.850 --> 00:41:19.480
And as long as the
risks are coming

00:41:19.480 --> 00:41:21.840
down faster than I'm
giving you money,

00:41:21.840 --> 00:41:24.440
our ROI is actually
getting better.

00:41:24.440 --> 00:41:26.274
And as long as
that's true, I'm just

00:41:26.274 --> 00:41:27.940
going to keep handing
you the resources.

00:41:27.940 --> 00:41:29.410
And if we go the
other way, where

00:41:29.410 --> 00:41:31.160
I'm giving you more
resources and it's not

00:41:31.160 --> 00:41:34.100
getting any less risky,
then probably the resources

00:41:34.100 --> 00:41:35.990
shouldn't keep coming.

00:41:35.990 --> 00:41:38.700
I think I have time
for one or two more.

00:41:38.700 --> 00:41:41.750
AUDIENCE: Specifically
about the self-driving cars,

00:41:41.750 --> 00:41:43.710
could you talk about
the 11 accidents

00:41:43.710 --> 00:41:45.960
that the cars have been
involved in over the past year

00:41:45.960 --> 00:41:48.770
or so, both how they happened
and what you've learned

00:41:48.770 --> 00:41:50.972
from them going forward.

00:41:50.972 --> 00:41:52.680
ASTRO TELLER: So there
are certain things

00:41:52.680 --> 00:41:55.350
that I'm not even
allowed to get into.

00:41:55.350 --> 00:41:57.652
There's legal issues around it.

00:41:57.652 --> 00:41:58.610
I don't mean at Google.

00:41:58.610 --> 00:42:03.230
I mean the DMV and
things like that.

00:42:03.230 --> 00:42:06.327
But what we've said publicly,
and I encourage everyone here,

00:42:06.327 --> 00:42:08.160
if you're interested,
to go look at the blog

00:42:08.160 --> 00:42:12.930
that we post that we put out
about this is 7 of those 11,

00:42:12.930 --> 00:42:14.350
we were parked.

00:42:14.350 --> 00:42:17.520
I mean not parked on the
side, we were stationary.

00:42:17.520 --> 00:42:18.810
So the car wasn't driving.

00:42:18.810 --> 00:42:20.300
The human wasn't driving either.

00:42:20.300 --> 00:42:22.982
We were just rear ended.

00:42:22.982 --> 00:42:24.690
I don't know what we
could do about that.

00:42:24.690 --> 00:42:25.950
That's just going
to keep happening.

00:42:25.950 --> 00:42:28.283
We should expect that to
happen at roughly the rate it's

00:42:28.283 --> 00:42:30.320
been happening to us
because we can't not

00:42:30.320 --> 00:42:33.340
have a back end to the car.

00:42:33.340 --> 00:42:37.300
The other four, the
person was driving.

00:42:37.300 --> 00:42:39.140
Our safety drivers
are pretty miraculous.

00:42:39.140 --> 00:42:42.360
And they have a much better
record than me or you guys do.

00:42:42.360 --> 00:42:44.760
But I'm sure we could
improve that in some ways.

00:42:44.760 --> 00:42:48.970
We have yet to have the
car be driving itself

00:42:48.970 --> 00:42:50.730
when any of these have happened.

00:42:50.730 --> 00:42:53.030
So I don't have more to
report to you on that.

00:42:53.030 --> 00:42:55.050
But I guess that's good news.

00:42:55.050 --> 00:42:58.140
But we plan to continue to do
these blog posts like we've

00:42:58.140 --> 00:43:01.350
been doing them to help people
understand what we're learning

00:43:01.350 --> 00:43:02.450
and how we can improve.

00:43:02.450 --> 00:43:02.950
All right.

00:43:02.950 --> 00:43:04.380
Last question.

00:43:04.380 --> 00:43:06.990
AUDIENCE: I had a question
about you personally.

00:43:06.990 --> 00:43:08.682
ASTRO TELLER: I'll get you too.

00:43:08.682 --> 00:43:10.140
AUDIENCE: You do
a lot of projects.

00:43:10.140 --> 00:43:11.430
You manage a lot of projects.

00:43:11.430 --> 00:43:12.240
You speak a lot.

00:43:12.240 --> 00:43:15.630
And like I've always
seen you at your 100%.

00:43:15.630 --> 00:43:17.720
So what are some
things that we can

00:43:17.720 --> 00:43:22.680
do that you do to switch
contexts between projects

00:43:22.680 --> 00:43:25.330
while remaining efficient.

00:43:25.330 --> 00:43:26.580
ASTRO TELLER: I'm not a maker.

00:43:26.580 --> 00:43:27.510
I mean, I used to be a maker.

00:43:27.510 --> 00:43:29.040
I have a PhD in
computer science.

00:43:29.040 --> 00:43:32.590
But to be fair, I'm good
at context switching.

00:43:32.590 --> 00:43:35.670
Makers, the people who are
actually building the stuff,

00:43:35.670 --> 00:43:38.610
do not context switch at the
speed that I context switch.

00:43:38.610 --> 00:43:41.350
So there's obviously
a much longer thing.

00:43:41.350 --> 00:43:43.220
Maybe I'll do a op-ed
on it or something.

00:43:43.220 --> 00:43:44.761
I think it's an
interesting question.

00:43:44.761 --> 00:43:49.000
But my short answer is hold
yourself to the energy level

00:43:49.000 --> 00:43:52.100
that you aspire to, but don't
necessarily hold yourself

00:43:52.100 --> 00:43:53.770
to the context
switching level that I

00:43:53.770 --> 00:43:58.610
do because that's not always the
way to be the most productive.

00:43:58.610 --> 00:44:01.160
AUDIENCE: I'm an
engineer at Salesforce.

00:44:01.160 --> 00:44:04.830
So I was wondering, I
always had this attitude

00:44:04.830 --> 00:44:07.190
where I go to the
different departments.

00:44:07.190 --> 00:44:11.520
I go to the strange people
in the different departments

00:44:11.520 --> 00:44:15.160
to get some code,
to just tell me

00:44:15.160 --> 00:44:19.060
how they did some things so I'm
not writing this from scratch.

00:44:19.060 --> 00:44:22.050
And I'm talking to the
people from the boss,

00:44:22.050 --> 00:44:23.290
like what they think.

00:44:23.290 --> 00:44:25.520
I have these strange things.

00:44:25.520 --> 00:44:27.260
And it's very beneficial.

00:44:27.260 --> 00:44:30.100
I found this progressing faster.

00:44:30.100 --> 00:44:34.280
I'm just curious from
the people around me,

00:44:34.280 --> 00:44:36.880
I didn't see a lot
of such people.

00:44:36.880 --> 00:44:42.550
And do you think from your
experience, it comes naturally

00:44:42.550 --> 00:44:46.840
or like you can teach
or motivate someone

00:44:46.840 --> 00:44:50.314
to do this because a lot
of people are just shy.

00:44:50.314 --> 00:44:51.980
ASTRO TELLER: I
understand the question.

00:44:51.980 --> 00:44:55.400
I believe everyone here
is a moonshot thinker,

00:44:55.400 --> 00:44:56.870
in your hearts.

00:44:56.870 --> 00:44:59.420
I promise you, I would not
be giving this talk this way

00:44:59.420 --> 00:45:00.780
if I did not believe that.

00:45:00.780 --> 00:45:02.630
I believe that
most of us are not

00:45:02.630 --> 00:45:07.530
in a context where we can be
as open minded, as honest,

00:45:07.530 --> 00:45:09.830
as dispassionate
when appropriate,

00:45:09.830 --> 00:45:13.970
as authentic as we want to be,
as our natural selves would be.

00:45:13.970 --> 00:45:18.304
And I think you need to ask your
context for that opportunity.

00:45:18.304 --> 00:45:20.720
And if it's really not going
to give it to you, be humble,

00:45:20.720 --> 00:45:21.930
try a few times.

00:45:21.930 --> 00:45:24.520
And if it doesn't work,
go find a new context.

00:45:24.520 --> 00:45:27.140
You all deserve to be
able to let the best

00:45:27.140 --> 00:45:28.810
part of your selves out.

00:45:28.810 --> 00:45:29.900
Thank you very much.

00:45:29.900 --> 00:45:33.550
