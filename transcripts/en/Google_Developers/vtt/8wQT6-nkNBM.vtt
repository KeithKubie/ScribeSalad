00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.270
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:08.270 --> 00:00:10.360
MALE SPEAKER: The actual
moonshot is wonderful,

00:00:10.360 --> 00:00:12.910
inspirational, poetic,
beautiful, involved.

00:00:12.910 --> 00:00:15.560
Great technical challenges,
genuine heroism.

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:16.490
It brought the world together.

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:21.280
But think about the Polynesian
islander on the dugout canoe,

00:00:21.280 --> 00:00:23.737
deciding one day they were
going to that way.

00:00:23.737 --> 00:00:25.500
No one had ever been
that way before.

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:28.350
No one even knew if there was
anything that way before.

00:00:28.350 --> 00:00:31.240
It was amazing, and it
changed the world.

00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:36.330
MALE SPEAKER: People can set
their minds to magical,

00:00:36.330 --> 00:00:38.590
seemingly impossible ideas.

00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:41.490
And then through science
and technology,

00:00:41.490 --> 00:00:44.250
bring them to reality.

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:47.600
And that then sets other people
on fire, that other

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:50.820
things that look impossible
might be accomplishable.

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:53.600
MEGAN SMITH: Galileo's such
a hero in thinking big.

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:57.669
And what he represents to me is
both curiosity and wonder

00:00:57.669 --> 00:01:00.603
that humanity had that he had
that pushed him and drove

00:01:00.603 --> 00:01:03.292
himself to invent and work on
the first telescopes that

00:01:03.292 --> 00:01:04.767
allowed us to see the moon.

00:01:04.767 --> 00:01:05.510
And here we are.

00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:07.750
MALE SPEAKER: These aviation
pioneers were figuring it out

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:08.690
as they went.

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:10.940
No one really knew how to build
an airplane, right?

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:12.105
No one knew how to
fly an airplane.

00:01:12.105 --> 00:01:14.880
It was amazing and crazy
and wonderful, and

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:16.740
they wanted to explore.

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:19.160
JOHN F. KENNEDY: Many years
ago, the great British

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:23.610
explorer George Mallory,
who was to die on Mt.

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:26.890
Everest, was asked, why did
he want to climb it?

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:28.640
He said because it is there.

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:30.444
MEGAN SMITH: There are so many
challenges in the world.

00:01:30.444 --> 00:01:34.300
And you can feel daunted by that
and oppressed by that.

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:36.750
Or you kind of say,
how might we think

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:38.170
differently about this?

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:39.500
MALE SPEAKER: Everyone else
in the world is working

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:40.570
on that next 10%.

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:43.220
If you can be the one that
delivers that 10 times

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:45.965
improvement, you have a chance
to really change things.

00:01:45.965 --> 00:01:48.930
MALE SPEAKER: If you want
cars to run at 50

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:50.850
miles per gallon, fine.

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:52.790
You can retool your
car a little bit.

00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:57.050
But if I tell you it has to run
on a gallon of gas for 500

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:59.710
miles, you have to start over.

00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:01.310
MEGAN SMITH: You need a lot of
courage in this work and you

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:02.620
need a lot of persistence.

00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:04.440
One of the things that's really
critical is not only

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:05.940
having the courage to
keep trying every

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:07.212
day or thinking big.

00:02:07.212 --> 00:02:10.910
Even if you don't really 100%
believe it's possible, you

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:12.680
might think, this might
be possible.

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:14.110
Have the courage to try.

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:15.560
That's how the greatest
things have happened.

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:18.150
MALE SPEAKER: You don't spend
your time being bothered that

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:20.590
you can't teleport from here
to Japan because there's a

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:22.510
part of you that thinks
it's impossible.

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:26.650
Moonshot thinking is choosing
to be bothered by that.

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:28.890
JOHN F. KENNEDY: We choose to go
to the moon in this decade

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:31.100
and do the other things.

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:34.750
Not because they are easy, but
because they are hard.

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:37.500
MALE SPEAKER: Humanity's
progress has been a series of

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:39.895
amazing, audacious things from
the very small and personal up

00:02:39.895 --> 00:02:42.070
to the great big and
grand, and we are

00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:43.126
a species of moonshots.

00:02:43.126 --> 00:02:45.316
And to me, that's the really
amazing, poetic,

00:02:45.316 --> 00:02:46.600
inspirational thing.

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:50.645
MALE SPEAKER: I think our
ambitions are a glass ceiling

00:02:50.645 --> 00:02:52.270
in what we can accomplish.

00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:53.930
MEGAN SMITH: When you find
your passion, you're

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:54.470
unstoppable.

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:56.382
You can make amazing
things happen.

00:02:56.382 --> 00:02:58.310
It's been true through
all of history.

00:02:58.310 --> 00:02:59.550
MALE SPEAKER: I believe
in the human spirit.

00:02:59.550 --> 00:03:01.600
And I believe that there are
always going to be crazy

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:03.180
people who get out of
bed one morning and

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:04.940
say, you know what?

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:06.420
I think I can build
a space cylinder.

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:07.520
And they'll just go do it.

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:11.120
But I think that if we become
afraid to take these great big

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:13.235
risks, we stop inspiring
people.

00:03:13.235 --> 00:03:15.170
We stop achieving things.

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:18.124
And the biggest nightmare
scenario is that we won't have

00:03:18.124 --> 00:03:20.434
what it takes to solve the
really big challenges.

00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:26.050
MALE SPEAKER: When Kennedy said
that we would put a man

00:03:26.050 --> 00:03:28.890
on the moon, it's about the fact
that he said, we don't

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:29.910
know how to do this yet.

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:31.560
And we're going to
do it anyway.

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:34.962
And that sends chills up
everybody's spine.

00:03:34.962 --> 00:03:37.568
Because if that happens,
what couldn't we do?

00:03:43.544 --> 00:03:45.040
MALE SPEAKER: And cue.

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:47.940
LOUIS GRAY: Welcome back to
Google Developers Live at I/O.

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:49.080
Welcome Megan Smith.

00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:50.070
MEGAN SMITH: Thank you.

00:03:50.070 --> 00:03:50.790
It's great to be here.

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:51.810
LOUIS GRAY: Thank you
for joining me.

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:53.270
I'm really excited
about moonshots.

00:03:53.270 --> 00:03:55.580
We've been talking about some
really incredible things.

00:03:55.580 --> 00:03:57.795
We just heard from Larry about
all the work that Google has

00:03:57.795 --> 00:03:58.430
been doing.

00:03:58.430 --> 00:04:01.020
We've heard from Vic and Sundar,
and really trying to

00:04:01.020 --> 00:04:03.140
change the world through
technology.

00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:04.900
Can you tell me a little bit
about what a moonshot is?

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:05.180
MEGAN SMITH: Sure.

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:09.630
Sometimes we think of it as 10
X better versus 1 X better.

00:04:09.630 --> 00:04:12.270
And in fact, we just
watched this film

00:04:12.270 --> 00:04:13.670
with some of us talking.

00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:18.980
Often, doing a 10 X can be, not
easier, but easier than

00:04:18.980 --> 00:04:22.320
you think than 1 X. We
just try to look at--

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:23.520
I think I have a graphic.

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:25.450
We launched a thing called Solve
for X, which is trying

00:04:25.450 --> 00:04:27.340
to get more moonshot thinking
in the world.

00:04:27.340 --> 00:04:28.790
And sometimes you think
about, there's a huge

00:04:28.790 --> 00:04:30.010
problem in the world.

00:04:30.010 --> 00:04:32.060
If we put up that graphic
there's three circles.

00:04:32.060 --> 00:04:34.810
Technology that maybe it appears
like science fiction,

00:04:34.810 --> 00:04:37.040
but it's coming online or
there's a new way to think

00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:40.980
about some technology, and let's
apply it in some way.

00:04:40.980 --> 00:04:42.450
Not unlike the original
moonshot.

00:04:42.450 --> 00:04:45.540
We want to get here by the end
of the decade, get started,

00:04:45.540 --> 00:04:46.840
start with Mercury and move.

00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:48.900
LOUIS GRAY: And the initiative
Solve for X really tries to

00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:50.220
solve global problems.

00:04:50.220 --> 00:04:52.390
One thing that really excited
me about Google in the first

00:04:52.390 --> 00:04:54.860
place was that we take on these
things that people say

00:04:54.860 --> 00:04:56.260
is impossible.

00:04:56.260 --> 00:04:57.950
How do we let the
impossibility of

00:04:57.950 --> 00:04:59.290
things get in the way?

00:04:59.290 --> 00:05:01.880
What do people say that they
can't do, and what do you

00:05:01.880 --> 00:05:04.170
think makes Google a
great place to say,

00:05:04.170 --> 00:05:06.066
yes, we can do this?

00:05:06.066 --> 00:05:07.810
MEGAN SMITH: We stand on the
shoulders of giants and

00:05:07.810 --> 00:05:08.840
amazing moonshot folks.

00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:11.790
I'm from Buffalo, New York
where Nikola Tesla took a

00:05:11.790 --> 00:05:14.830
moonshot to use Niagara Falls to
light Buffalo years ago to

00:05:14.830 --> 00:05:17.250
demo modern electrification.

00:05:17.250 --> 00:05:19.660
So many people have been
thinking like that, but it

00:05:19.660 --> 00:05:20.810
maybe hasn't been
the majority.

00:05:20.810 --> 00:05:23.420
And certainly Larry and Sergey
in founding Google thought

00:05:23.420 --> 00:05:24.770
about, what's the big idea?

00:05:24.770 --> 00:05:25.550
What we can do?

00:05:25.550 --> 00:05:27.140
They were passionate, of course,
about Search in the

00:05:27.140 --> 00:05:29.800
beginning but have taken us
in a lot of directions.

00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:33.000
I think also in some ways
there's some moonshot work

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:35.700
around how we do our work,
how we collaborate.

00:05:35.700 --> 00:05:38.540
I love that Larry just did
a full open Q&amp;A, very--

00:05:38.540 --> 00:05:42.230
transparency is a fundamental
thing, and collaboration.

00:05:42.230 --> 00:05:43.650
LOUIS GRAY: That's something
that's really important to us

00:05:43.650 --> 00:05:44.800
in Google Developers Live.

00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:47.290
I want to break those barriers
down so all of the people on

00:05:47.290 --> 00:05:49.540
the live stream can not only
see us and talk to us, but

00:05:49.540 --> 00:05:52.500
engage with us and have that
kind of Q&amp;A that we honestly

00:05:52.500 --> 00:05:54.000
get as employees from Google.

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:55.890
To hear from Larry, it's really
exciting to see Larry

00:05:55.890 --> 00:05:59.070
and all the other engineers
engaging with developers here.

00:05:59.070 --> 00:06:01.360
When I look at Google and
we talk about moonshots,

00:06:01.360 --> 00:06:03.300
obviously things like
self-driving cars come to

00:06:03.300 --> 00:06:06.650
mind, and other bits
like Gmail.

00:06:06.650 --> 00:06:08.700
It wasn't too long ago
that Gmail came out.

00:06:08.700 --> 00:06:10.460
It came out on April Fools'
Day of all things.

00:06:10.460 --> 00:06:12.030
I didn't even know
if it was real.

00:06:12.030 --> 00:06:14.560
But they promised us a whole
gigabyte of email when

00:06:14.560 --> 00:06:17.180
everyone else was offering
20 or 40 megs.

00:06:17.180 --> 00:06:19.410
What is your thought in terms
of what are some moonshots

00:06:19.410 --> 00:06:22.410
that Google's done so far, and
what comes to mind in terms of

00:06:22.410 --> 00:06:24.320
something that we can
really deliver on

00:06:24.320 --> 00:06:25.540
to change the world?

00:06:25.540 --> 00:06:26.730
MEGAN SMITH: Well there's a
range of moonshots that

00:06:26.730 --> 00:06:27.790
Googlers have taken.

00:06:27.790 --> 00:06:30.470
And I always think that
moonshots are both the idea

00:06:30.470 --> 00:06:31.770
and the people, or the team.

00:06:31.770 --> 00:06:33.510
Who and what are
never separate.

00:06:33.510 --> 00:06:35.390
You know Maps and Geo would
be a good example.

00:06:35.390 --> 00:06:38.010
This incredible team of Keyhole
and Where2 Tech, other

00:06:38.010 --> 00:06:38.970
small acquisitions we've made.

00:06:38.970 --> 00:06:42.000
And the teams came and we got
together and really pushed it

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:44.060
and wanted to have free full
mapping to everybody.

00:06:44.060 --> 00:06:46.610
And some of things we've just
seen demonstrated are on that

00:06:46.610 --> 00:06:48.410
path of really thinking big.

00:06:48.410 --> 00:06:49.820
LOUIS GRAY: I know you
talk about big.

00:06:49.820 --> 00:06:51.850
It's really incredible to think
about the millions of

00:06:51.850 --> 00:06:54.920
miles that are in Street View,
and the fact that just a few

00:06:54.920 --> 00:06:56.830
years ago, you wouldn't have
thought of having the entire

00:06:56.830 --> 00:06:59.930
globe in a little smartphone in
your pocket that you take

00:06:59.930 --> 00:07:01.090
with you everywhere.

00:07:01.090 --> 00:07:03.900
And the moonshot really takes
the impossible, the

00:07:03.900 --> 00:07:07.270
incredible, and makes it real,
and makes it happen.

00:07:07.270 --> 00:07:09.770
For somebody who's going to the
Solve for X website, how

00:07:09.770 --> 00:07:10.800
can they get started?

00:07:10.800 --> 00:07:13.150
What is it that they can do to
find other people with similar

00:07:13.150 --> 00:07:13.800
dreams like them?

00:07:13.800 --> 00:07:14.240
MEGAN SMITH: Right.

00:07:14.240 --> 00:07:16.450
On our website the main
thing is we want

00:07:16.450 --> 00:07:17.910
people to put up proposals.

00:07:17.910 --> 00:07:18.410
What are their moonshots?

00:07:18.410 --> 00:07:20.730
We want to celebrate
people and process.

00:07:20.730 --> 00:07:23.080
Of course we want the historic
stuff and hear what great

00:07:23.080 --> 00:07:24.670
people have done and inspire
us that way.

00:07:24.670 --> 00:07:27.270
But also let's help people and
teams and process, and let's

00:07:27.270 --> 00:07:29.380
get inspired by each other
to think of new things.

00:07:29.380 --> 00:07:31.960
So a lot of things to watch
and collaborate on there.

00:07:31.960 --> 00:07:35.050
And in general, Larry's
saying, think big.

00:07:35.050 --> 00:07:36.750
That's what we're
trying to do.

00:07:36.750 --> 00:07:38.620
The other thing that we're
trying to do is that ideas

00:07:38.620 --> 00:07:39.760
come from everywhere.

00:07:39.760 --> 00:07:41.800
Bill Clinton says, 21st century
is really about

00:07:41.800 --> 00:07:43.390
creative collaboration.

00:07:43.390 --> 00:07:46.450
Back to the Maps example, we are
doing things in Maps but

00:07:46.450 --> 00:07:48.920
then there's things where people
are adding edits and

00:07:48.920 --> 00:07:54.140
things on top, layers,
amazing innovations.

00:07:54.140 --> 00:07:58.440
Ushahidi is such a fabulous
innovation on top of mapping

00:07:58.440 --> 00:08:00.290
to help with crisis
around the world.

00:08:00.290 --> 00:08:02.370
So collaboration together,
and I love that we're on

00:08:02.370 --> 00:08:05.180
Developers Live, because
it's all about the

00:08:05.180 --> 00:08:06.290
interconnection of us.

00:08:06.290 --> 00:08:08.710
I have to give a talk
this summer.

00:08:08.710 --> 00:08:10.710
It's called the next greatest
generation.

00:08:10.710 --> 00:08:14.140
I think the next greatest
generation is actually all of

00:08:14.140 --> 00:08:15.543
us networked.

00:08:15.543 --> 00:08:16.450
LOUIS GRAY: Right.

00:08:16.450 --> 00:08:18.700
And so one thing, [INAUDIBLE]
we looked at Google.

00:08:18.700 --> 00:08:19.610
Google's a business.

00:08:19.610 --> 00:08:21.160
We're not a nonprofit.

00:08:21.160 --> 00:08:23.250
Is it possible to do a moonshot
without first

00:08:23.250 --> 00:08:24.480
thinking of revenue?

00:08:24.480 --> 00:08:27.000
Like, how can we do something
that is not only incredible,

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:28.960
but does it have
to make money?

00:08:28.960 --> 00:08:30.890
How do you separate the business
side of things from

00:08:30.890 --> 00:08:34.610
the actual want to change the
world ideals of doing things?

00:08:34.610 --> 00:08:37.350
MEGAN SMITH: I always think
there's for profit, nonprofit.

00:08:37.350 --> 00:08:39.830
But there always needs to be
revenue coming towards

00:08:39.830 --> 00:08:42.190
something even if it's gifted
revenue, donations, or

00:08:42.190 --> 00:08:43.440
philanthropic, or

00:08:43.440 --> 00:08:45.620
kickstarterly things or others.

00:08:45.620 --> 00:08:47.910
So I think the most important
thing is not to start with the

00:08:47.910 --> 00:08:50.220
money, to start with
the big idea.

00:08:50.220 --> 00:08:51.960
We did that with Google,
we've done that

00:08:51.960 --> 00:08:52.720
with so many products.

00:08:52.720 --> 00:08:55.990
And then the money can follow
if it's incredibly valuable.

00:08:55.990 --> 00:08:58.910
And sometimes innovating how the
money should follow is a

00:08:58.910 --> 00:09:00.410
big part of the design.

00:09:00.410 --> 00:09:02.635
The internet is such an
example of freemium.

00:09:02.635 --> 00:09:06.260
It's the idea that free things
and then add ways to pay for

00:09:06.260 --> 00:09:09.980
some part, or media-based
advertising, et cetera.

00:09:09.980 --> 00:09:11.800
So there's a lot of different
models out there

00:09:11.800 --> 00:09:12.990
that you can use.

00:09:12.990 --> 00:09:15.270
But I think the most important
thing is find something you're

00:09:15.270 --> 00:09:17.530
really passionate about doing
and something that's really

00:09:17.530 --> 00:09:18.650
needed in the world.

00:09:18.650 --> 00:09:23.070
Those two things together let
the business plan follow that.

00:09:23.070 --> 00:09:24.650
LOUIS GRAY: As Vice President
of Google x, you see

00:09:24.650 --> 00:09:26.300
incredible things every day.

00:09:26.300 --> 00:09:28.100
Things that the world knows
about, things that I know

00:09:28.100 --> 00:09:30.750
about, and then things that
almost nobody knows about.

00:09:30.750 --> 00:09:32.370
And you must have an incredibly
busy time.

00:09:32.370 --> 00:09:34.470
Now, what else are you doing at
Google I/O in addition to

00:09:34.470 --> 00:09:36.510
speaking with us today?

00:09:36.510 --> 00:09:38.520
MEGAN SMITH: The Google X team
is here with Google Glass, of

00:09:38.520 --> 00:09:40.630
course, and Larry was
talking about the

00:09:40.630 --> 00:09:42.890
self-driving car ambitions.

00:09:42.890 --> 00:09:44.690
And then we have a lot of other
things we're thinking

00:09:44.690 --> 00:09:46.850
about and working on.

00:09:46.850 --> 00:09:48.900
We're still cooking them,
they're still early.

00:09:48.900 --> 00:09:50.420
So we're working on those.

00:09:50.420 --> 00:09:52.720
And then of course Solve for
X, sort of sharing this.

00:09:52.720 --> 00:09:54.830
I'm also personally working
a lot on diversity.

00:09:54.830 --> 00:09:57.430
And we have a session later
today at 5:30 on live stream

00:09:57.430 --> 00:10:01.280
that I hope people join, Seven
Tech Makers and a Microphone.

00:10:01.280 --> 00:10:03.160
The Women Tech Makers
Live at [? I/O. ?]

00:10:03.160 --> 00:10:04.785
LOUIS GRAY: We've had a number
of sessions on Women Tech

00:10:04.785 --> 00:10:05.770
Makers on GDL.

00:10:05.770 --> 00:10:08.140
It's been really a key focus for
us to make sure that we're

00:10:08.140 --> 00:10:09.830
highlighting incredible women.

00:10:09.830 --> 00:10:12.000
I was really pleased to make
sure that you went first and

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:13.720
would be our first guest.

00:10:13.720 --> 00:10:16.010
Not because you're a woman but
because you are an incredible

00:10:16.010 --> 00:10:19.700
executive who has a proven track
record, who happens to

00:10:19.700 --> 00:10:20.700
be a woman.

00:10:20.700 --> 00:10:23.040
And you're doing a lot of great
stuff with WTM as we

00:10:23.040 --> 00:10:24.350
call it, with Woman
Tech Makers.

00:10:24.350 --> 00:10:26.880
And I'm glad that that's been
an incredible focus.

00:10:26.880 --> 00:10:28.660
MEGAN SMITH: Yeah, and Larry was
just answering a question

00:10:28.660 --> 00:10:31.550
about getting more girls and
boys, but girls into STEM

00:10:31.550 --> 00:10:32.440
technologies.

00:10:32.440 --> 00:10:35.620
There are so many jobs open that
we don't have people for.

00:10:35.620 --> 00:10:37.850
We need a lot of people to
come into our field.

00:10:37.850 --> 00:10:40.540
And a friend of mine, Nicholas
[? Nicaponi ?]

00:10:40.540 --> 00:10:43.520
once said, have you
ever had a job?

00:10:43.520 --> 00:10:45.800
Meaning this is passion
work that we do.

00:10:45.800 --> 00:10:47.070
It's not required work.

00:10:47.070 --> 00:10:49.190
And so for young people
to know about this

00:10:49.190 --> 00:10:50.580
work is really important.

00:10:50.580 --> 00:10:53.310
And the visibility of technical
women is important.

00:10:53.310 --> 00:10:55.530
Because technical women, for
whatever reason through media

00:10:55.530 --> 00:10:58.490
and others, have not been as
visible as they should be.

00:10:58.490 --> 00:11:00.720
Including later today, we're
going to talk about a history

00:11:00.720 --> 00:11:04.850
story at 5:30 Pacific that
nobody has ever heard, pretty

00:11:04.850 --> 00:11:06.250
much at [? scale ?], so
that should be fun.

00:11:06.250 --> 00:11:07.110
LOUIS GRAY: For sure.

00:11:07.110 --> 00:11:08.640
Well I definitely appreciate
you coming and

00:11:08.640 --> 00:11:09.410
talking with me.

00:11:09.410 --> 00:11:11.870
We're going to be producing a
lot of exclusive interviews

00:11:11.870 --> 00:11:13.550
with Googlers throughout
the day.

00:11:13.550 --> 00:11:15.250
On Google Developers Live, we're
going to be highlighting

00:11:15.250 --> 00:11:18.310
some of our partners in the
sandboxes and we have a lot

00:11:18.310 --> 00:11:18.890
more content.

00:11:18.890 --> 00:11:20.780
What we're going to be doing
right next is we're going to

00:11:20.780 --> 00:11:23.120
be going back to the sessions,
so start to see the live

00:11:23.120 --> 00:11:24.760
sessions from all of the streams
that you're looking at

00:11:24.760 --> 00:11:27.140
from Android, Chrome, and
other technical topics.

00:11:27.140 --> 00:11:29.990
And then we'll be right back
here at the GDL at I/O stage

00:11:29.990 --> 00:11:32.280
around 1:30 to talk about
Blink with Chrome.

00:11:32.280 --> 00:11:33.560
So thank you very much, Megan.

00:11:33.560 --> 00:11:34.750
MEGAN SMITH: Thanks Louis and
thanks everyone online for

00:11:34.750 --> 00:11:36.000
joining us.
