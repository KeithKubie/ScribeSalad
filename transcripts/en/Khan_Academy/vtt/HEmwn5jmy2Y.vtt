00:00:00.459 --> 00:00:03.578
- [Instructor] We're told
that Mael mixes 15 milliliters

00:00:03.578 --> 00:00:06.495
of bleach with 3.75 liters of water

00:00:07.936 --> 00:00:10.893
to make a sanitizing
solution for a daycare.

00:00:10.893 --> 00:00:12.832
The amounts of bleach and water

00:00:12.832 --> 00:00:15.046
always have to be proportional

00:00:15.046 --> 00:00:17.810
when he makes the sanitizing solution.

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:20.666
Which of the following could
be combinations of volumes

00:00:20.666 --> 00:00:24.607
of bleach and water for
Mael's sanitizing solution?

00:00:24.607 --> 00:00:26.598
And they gave us,
actually they gave us five

00:00:26.598 --> 00:00:29.463
potential combinations,
they say pick three.

00:00:29.463 --> 00:00:30.967
So I encourage you to pause this video

00:00:30.967 --> 00:00:32.227
and try to figure it out.

00:00:32.227 --> 00:00:34.929
Remember, he mixes 15
milliliters of bleach

00:00:34.929 --> 00:00:37.512
for every 3.75 liters of water.

00:00:40.565 --> 00:00:43.352
Alright, now let's try
to work this together.

00:00:43.352 --> 00:00:44.781
So I'm gonna make a table here.

00:00:44.781 --> 00:00:49.761
So let's say this is bleach,
bleach in milliliters.

00:00:49.761 --> 00:00:52.844
And lets say this is water in liters.

00:00:54.657 --> 00:00:58.490
And they tell us that
he mixes 15 milliliters,

00:01:00.642 --> 00:01:01.883
the unit here is milliliters,

00:01:01.883 --> 00:01:04.474
for every 15 milliliters of bleach

00:01:04.474 --> 00:01:07.057
for every 3.75 liters of water.

00:01:09.955 --> 00:01:12.983
So what is the
proportionality constant here?

00:01:12.983 --> 00:01:16.529
If you said the water is
equal to some constant

00:01:16.529 --> 00:01:19.222
times the bleach, well what's going on?

00:01:19.222 --> 00:01:22.482
Well let's see, what would
he have to multiply by?

00:01:22.482 --> 00:01:25.982
He would have to multiply by 3.75 over 15.

00:01:29.381 --> 00:01:31.964
Now what is 3.75 divided by 15?

00:01:33.009 --> 00:01:34.998
Let me actually do it right over here,

00:01:34.998 --> 00:01:36.498
15 goes into 3.75.

00:01:39.044 --> 00:01:42.053
Let's see, 15 goes into 37 two times,

00:01:42.053 --> 00:01:43.261
we have our little
decimal right over here,

00:01:43.261 --> 00:01:46.178
two times 15 is 30, subtract seven,

00:01:48.272 --> 00:01:52.505
bring down the five and
then 15 times five is 75,

00:01:52.505 --> 00:01:55.858
five times 15 is 75, it all works out.

00:01:55.858 --> 00:01:58.945
So we see to go from bleach to water

00:01:58.945 --> 00:02:03.112
we're multiplying by a
proportionality constant of 0.25.

00:02:05.855 --> 00:02:07.328
So we have to see which of these

00:02:07.328 --> 00:02:09.807
have the same exact
proportionality constant

00:02:09.807 --> 00:02:11.961
going from bleach to water.

00:02:11.961 --> 00:02:15.628
So let's see, this next
one is 12 and three.

00:02:18.064 --> 00:02:20.481
So if we multiply 12 by 0.25,

00:02:23.254 --> 00:02:24.514
do we get three?

00:02:24.514 --> 00:02:27.776
Yeah, three is one fourth
of 12, 0.25, 25 hundredths

00:02:27.776 --> 00:02:31.655
is the same thing as one
fourth so this one checks out.

00:02:31.655 --> 00:02:34.405
What about going from six to 1.5?

00:02:36.845 --> 00:02:39.095
Are we multiplying by 0.25?

00:02:40.211 --> 00:02:42.711
Yeah, 1.5 is one fourth of six

00:02:44.077 --> 00:02:46.103
or another way to think about it is

00:02:46.103 --> 00:02:47.853
what is six times 25?

00:02:49.951 --> 00:02:52.909
It is a 150 so six times 25 hundredths

00:02:52.909 --> 00:02:57.318
would be a 150 hundredths
which is the same thing as 1.5.

00:02:57.318 --> 00:02:58.903
So this one works.

00:02:58.903 --> 00:03:01.693
What about three and 0.75?

00:03:01.693 --> 00:03:03.193
So three and 0.75.

00:03:05.796 --> 00:03:07.879
Am I multiplying by 0.25?

00:03:08.757 --> 00:03:11.427
Yeah, if I multiply three
times 25 hundredths,

00:03:11.427 --> 00:03:14.384
I get 75 hundredths so that works.

00:03:14.384 --> 00:03:16.965
So actually the first three
choices are our three answers

00:03:16.965 --> 00:03:18.680
but let's just verify that the next two

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:21.069
are not good answers.

00:03:21.069 --> 00:03:24.152
So let's see, if I go from 20 to 5.5,

00:03:27.671 --> 00:03:30.338
and so am I multiplying by 0.25?

00:03:31.663 --> 00:03:34.975
No, 0.25 which is the
same thing as one fourth,

00:03:34.975 --> 00:03:38.629
one fourth times 20 is five, not 5.5.

00:03:38.629 --> 00:03:39.892
So that doesn't work.

00:03:39.892 --> 00:03:42.475
And then going from 11 to 3.75,

00:03:44.483 --> 00:03:46.200
well we definitely know
that's not gonna work

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:48.640
because notice we have
the same amount of water

00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:50.640
but we have less bleach.

00:03:51.572 --> 00:03:53.973
Or you could say what's one fourth of 11?

00:03:53.973 --> 00:03:57.327
Well that's going to be less than 3.75

00:03:57.327 --> 00:04:00.744
so we can rule both of these choices out.
