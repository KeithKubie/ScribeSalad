00:00:00.179 --> 00:00:07.790
The bubonic plague is still killing people
all around the globe - but should we be worried?

00:00:07.790 --> 00:00:15.260
Hey guys, Tara here for Dnews - and we’ve
all heard of the bubonic plague.

00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:19.740
It’s the devastating disease that eats your
body from the inside out - and was responsible

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:26.030
for the deaths of over 75 million people in
the 14th century, including over half of Europe’s

00:00:26.030 --> 00:00:27.060
entire population.

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:30.980
What you might not know, is that the plague
is still around - and it’s still killing

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:31.980
people!

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:36.230
A city in China called Yumen was sealed off
last week, after a 38-year-old man died of

00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:39.980
the disease, after coming into contact with
an infected marmot.

00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:44.710
And 151 others in that city were placed under
“quarantine,” for coming into contact

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:45.710
with him.

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:49.370
But is this the same plague that killed all
those people hundreds of years ago?

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:51.550
Well… in a nutshell, yes!

00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:56.060
The plague that existed in the 14th century,
now commonly referred to as the Black Death,

00:00:56.060 --> 00:01:00.660
was caused by a bacterium called Yersinia
pestis - and it’s almost identical to the

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:02.110
one that exists today.

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:07.190
That single strain, which was originally transferred
to humans by fleas, can cause 3 separate versions

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:08.190
of the plague.

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:12.110
There’s the bubonic plague (which is the
simplest version), the pneumonic plague (which

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:16.640
is a lung infection that’s rarer, but more
devastating than the other two forms), and

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:21.110
the septicemic plague (which is the rarest
of the three, and causes all of the blood

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:22.400
in your body to clot.)

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:26.840
Some reports are saying the man in China died
of the pneumonic version, while others say

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:28.510
it was septicemic or bubonic.

00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:31.850
But it’s entirely possible that all three
of those are true.

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:36.119
The bubonic plague typically appears in localized
areas, like the lymph nodes - but without

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:40.360
treatment, the infection can spread to your
blood, morphing into the septicemic version.

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:44.320
From there, if it settles into the lungs - it
can transform once again into the pneumonic

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:47.460
version - which is easily the most contagious
form of the three.

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:51.110
It’s the septicemic version, though, that
gives the Black Death its name.

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:55.689
The lack of blood flow, causes the extremities
to turn black, until your limbs literally

00:01:55.689 --> 00:01:56.689
fall off.

00:01:56.689 --> 00:01:59.200
And all of this can happen within a span of
24 hours.

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:03.590
It’s terrifying stuff, and even though the
bubonic plague still exists - even in developed

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:07.729
countries, like the United States - it’s
now completely curable with antibiotics.

00:02:07.729 --> 00:02:11.659
Just last week, 4 Colorado residents were
diagnosed with the pneumonic plague after

00:02:11.659 --> 00:02:14.189
coming into contact with an infected dog.

00:02:14.189 --> 00:02:16.840
All of them have now been treated, and are
expected to live.

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:21.420
But the man who died in China, likely didn’t
have access to antibiotics, which explains

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:23.760
why such drastic measures were taken.

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:28.329
Disease control specialists quarantined all
30,000 residents in Yumen for 9 days - to

00:02:28.329 --> 00:02:32.150
perform disinfection as well as rat extermination.

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:36.040
They also ran education sessions to raise
awareness of how people can guard themselves

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:37.219
against infection.

00:02:37.219 --> 00:02:40.389
As of today, the quarantine has been lifted
- and no more deaths are expected.

00:02:40.389 --> 00:02:42.109
At least, for now.

00:02:42.109 --> 00:02:45.699
People who live in rural areas with lots of
rodents, are far more at risk than the general

00:02:45.699 --> 00:02:46.879
population.

00:02:46.879 --> 00:02:50.359
But it still stands, that anyone can theoretically
contract the plague.

00:02:50.359 --> 00:02:54.469
As long as you catch it early, though - and
have access to antibiotics - there’s really

00:02:54.469 --> 00:02:55.680
no need to worry.

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:57.409
Yay, modern medicine!

00:02:57.409 --> 00:03:01.139
