&gt;&gt;Hello. One of the biggest problems today
is lack of knowledge. Lack of knowledge creates

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:17.610
uncertainty; lack of knowledge creates fear,
lack of knowledge leads to mistakes, big and

00:00:17.610 --> 00:00:24.130
small. The lack of knowledge is the result
of lack of exchange of information. There

00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:28.599
are some people who don't like to receive
information; we are not talking about them.

00:00:28.599 --> 00:00:35.699
Most of the people need and want to have information
and it's our responsibility to create the

00:00:35.699 --> 00:00:41.729
infrastructure to create the circumstances
for the free exchange of information, the

00:00:41.729 --> 00:00:48.429
free information flow. I believe that information
society will make our life better.
