00:00:00.710 --> 00:00:02.660
The home stretch, we're
on problem 18.

00:00:02.660 --> 00:00:06.570
And this diagram actually looks
like something that this

00:00:06.570 --> 00:00:09.410
little tool I'm using is
well-suited to draw.

00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:13.410
Let me try-- I'll draw the one
in the back first, so I can do

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:16.470
different colors
and everything.

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:21.370
So I'll do the one in the back
in yellow, and it looks

00:00:21.370 --> 00:00:23.010
something like this.

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:28.100
Goes like this, then it switches
over like that.

00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:31.790
And then I'll draw the next one,
this orange color, and it

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:36.200
looks something-- no, I'll do
it in a more drastic color.

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:37.600
So it does something
like this.

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:42.330
It goes like this, crosses over,
dips down, then it goes

00:00:42.330 --> 00:00:43.760
over again.

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:48.660
And then finally, this last
one, and it looks

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:51.550
something like this.

00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:55.530
Crosses over and it goes
like that, very pretty.

00:00:55.530 --> 00:01:00.990
Now let me switch to
a smaller-- OK.

00:01:00.990 --> 00:01:03.030
Why don't we do white, I
never write in white.

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:06.910
In the figure above--so they
say this is the start.

00:01:06.910 --> 00:01:08.320
And this is step 1.

00:01:11.645 --> 00:01:14.770
This is step 2.

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:15.670
OK, what is this?

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:18.610
In the figure above, three
wires are braided.

00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:22.580
That is, by starting in the
order A, B, C-- OK, so this is

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:30.890
A, B, C-- and then the order
changes to B-- right, because

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:33.730
the yellow line is B-- A, C.

00:01:33.730 --> 00:01:37.350
And then we get B, C, A.

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:37.770
Right?

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:40.580
There's just the order of the
strings, left to right.

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:43.380
Or the braids, or the wires.

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:44.580
OK.

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:47.040
That is start with the order A,
B, C, the outer left wire

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:48.670
is brought over wire B, right?

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:52.380
This is brought over wire B, to
the middle position forming

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:53.610
the order shown in step 1.

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:58.350
Than the outer right wire C,
this one, is brought to the

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:00.750
new middle position shown
in step 2, and so on.

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:03.850
Alternately bringing each new
left and each new right wire

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:04.770
to the middle.

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:09.449
At what numbered step does the
braid first repeat the

00:02:09.449 --> 00:02:13.070
original order A, B, C?

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:16.910
So what you do is, you first
bring the left over the

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:18.865
middle, then you bring the right
over the middle, then

00:02:18.865 --> 00:02:20.730
you bring the left over the
middle, then you bring the

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:22.310
right over the middle.

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:24.470
So at step 3, what
do we have to do?

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:27.750
So step 1 we brought the
left over the middle.

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:29.840
So we went from A, B, C.

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:32.720
You essentially switch the
left and the middle.

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:35.330
And then step 2, you switch
the right and the middle.

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:39.420
So step 3, we switch
B and C again.

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:41.790
Because we're back on
the left-hand side.

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:44.930
So you get C, B, A.

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:46.765
And then step 4, you're
going to switch to

00:02:46.765 --> 00:02:48.690
the right-hand side.

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:52.170
Step 3 we switched these two.

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:54.470
Now step 4, we're going
to switch these two.

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:57.930
So you get C, A, B.

00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:02.020
Then in step 5, we're back
switched on this side.

00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:05.180
So then you get A, C, B.

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:07.380
And then step 6, you're going
to switch to the right-hand

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:07.895
side again.

00:03:07.895 --> 00:03:10.610
So you get A, B, C.

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:12.045
So by step 6, we repeat.

00:03:12.045 --> 00:03:13.890
So that's choice D.

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:16.030
The hard part here, as far
as I'm concerned, is just

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:18.070
understanding the problem
and their diagram.

00:03:18.070 --> 00:03:19.460
And then just seeing the pattern
that you're just

00:03:19.460 --> 00:03:20.910
switching the letters.

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:23.490
First you switch the left
and the middle letter.

00:03:23.490 --> 00:03:24.740
Then you switch the right
and the middle letter.

00:03:24.740 --> 00:03:26.050
Then you switch the left
and the middle letter.

00:03:26.050 --> 00:03:27.610
Then you switch the right
and the middle letter.

00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:29.810
Until you get back to A, B, C.

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:32.900
Next problem.

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:34.860
White I don't think is
colorful enough.

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:36.690
Let me do magenta.

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:39.450
19.

00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:42.360
In a set of 11 different
numbers-- they're different--

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:44.920
which of the following
cannot affect the

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:46.170
value of the median?

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:54.670
So it's a set of 11 different
numbers, they're different, so

00:03:54.670 --> 00:03:56.210
let's say it's 1 through 11.

00:03:56.210 --> 00:04:02.450
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6,
7, 8, 9, 10, 11.

00:04:02.450 --> 00:04:05.300
That's 11 different numbers.

00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:06.660
And in this case, what's
the median?

00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:09.010
Well we have 5 on this side, 5--
the median is this, this

00:04:09.010 --> 00:04:10.610
is the middle number, right?

00:04:10.610 --> 00:04:12.000
6 is the middle number.

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:14.350
Doubling each number-- well,
if you double every number,

00:04:14.350 --> 00:04:17.700
the median's going to become
12, so that's not right.

00:04:17.700 --> 00:04:20.060
Increasing each number by 10--
once again, if you increase

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:23.280
all of these numbers by 10, this
number's going to be 16,

00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:25.380
so you would've changed
the median.

00:04:25.380 --> 00:04:30.060
Increasing the smallest
number only.

00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:33.690
Well, what if you increase
the smallest number to,

00:04:33.690 --> 00:04:35.430
I don't know, 12?

00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:37.540
So then this 12 would
go all the way on

00:04:37.540 --> 00:04:39.610
the other side, right?

00:04:39.610 --> 00:04:42.840
And then the median would move
to 7 because you would have to

00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:45.480
have 5 below the median and
5 above the median.

00:04:45.480 --> 00:04:46.980
So you can increase that
smallest number.

00:04:46.980 --> 00:04:49.830
But if you increase it by a
large enough amount, it kind

00:04:49.830 --> 00:04:51.930
of goes into the greater than
the median column, and then

00:04:51.930 --> 00:04:54.780
the median would have to
shift to the right.

00:04:54.780 --> 00:04:59.060
Try it out, write out the list
from 2 to 12, and then the

00:04:59.060 --> 00:05:00.480
median becomes 7.

00:05:00.480 --> 00:05:03.080
OK, so we know that choice
B is not right.

00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:06.777
Choice C, increasing-- oh no,
that was choice C-- choice D,

00:05:06.777 --> 00:05:10.640
decreasing the largest number
only-- well, the same

00:05:10.640 --> 00:05:11.390
argument can apply.

00:05:11.390 --> 00:05:15.330
We could take the 11 and
decrease it down to, I don't

00:05:15.330 --> 00:05:17.690
know, decrease it to 0.

00:05:17.690 --> 00:05:20.050
You decrease it to 0, then
that'll-- and you could list

00:05:20.050 --> 00:05:22.450
them all out, 0 through 10--
and then the median number

00:05:22.450 --> 00:05:25.700
will shift to 5, so that
will change it.

00:05:25.700 --> 00:05:29.340
E, increasing the largest
number only.

00:05:29.340 --> 00:05:31.360
I can tell you that's the
answer from deductive

00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:35.210
reasoning, but if we just take
this 11 and we make it one

00:05:35.210 --> 00:05:39.740
billion, does that change the
fact that they're five numbers

00:05:39.740 --> 00:05:41.880
larger than 6 and five
numbers less than 6?

00:05:41.880 --> 00:05:42.990
Ignore the 0.

00:05:42.990 --> 00:05:44.590
Five numbers less than 6?

00:05:44.590 --> 00:05:45.370
No.

00:05:45.370 --> 00:05:47.140
I can make it into a trillion.

00:05:47.140 --> 00:05:50.350
I can change it to any number,
but the fact remains that I

00:05:50.350 --> 00:05:52.475
have the same amount of
numbers larger than 6

00:05:52.475 --> 00:05:54.340
as I do below 6.

00:05:54.340 --> 00:05:59.410
So choice E cannot affect
the value of the median.

00:05:59.410 --> 00:06:01.110
E.

00:06:01.110 --> 00:06:02.360
Next problem.

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:09.340
OK, something for me to draw.

00:06:09.340 --> 00:06:11.710
Let's see, they have a 1/4
circle, so I'll just draw a

00:06:11.710 --> 00:06:15.500
big circle, and I'll just
focus on a 1/4 of it.

00:06:22.390 --> 00:06:24.810
Close enough.

00:06:24.810 --> 00:06:27.760
That looks like a
1/4 of a circle.

00:06:27.760 --> 00:06:30.690
They say that-- oh, and there's
a rectangle there too,

00:06:30.690 --> 00:06:32.520
fascinating.

00:06:32.520 --> 00:06:35.770
So this rectangle in this 1/4
circle, so this rectangle

00:06:35.770 --> 00:06:37.940
could look like this.

00:06:37.940 --> 00:06:41.640
I know theirs looks taller,
but I think this will do.

00:06:41.640 --> 00:06:43.605
And then I think I'm
almost done.

00:06:43.605 --> 00:06:47.510
I think I'm there,
I think I can.

00:06:47.510 --> 00:06:49.930
And then they shade in some
stuff, so if they shaded it, I

00:06:49.930 --> 00:06:51.920
will shade it.

00:06:51.920 --> 00:06:54.270
A suitably tasteful color.

00:06:57.300 --> 00:07:00.500
OK, so I have shaded what
they have shaded.

00:07:00.500 --> 00:07:02.220
And now, what are they saying?

00:07:02.220 --> 00:07:15.710
They're saying that this
is R, C, T, B, S, A.

00:07:15.710 --> 00:07:20.060
And then they tell us that
is a 90 degree angle.

00:07:20.060 --> 00:07:22.980
And then they tell us that this
distance, from here to

00:07:22.980 --> 00:07:26.390
here, from all the way to the
top-- so it's essentially the

00:07:26.390 --> 00:07:29.700
radius of the circle-- is 6.

00:07:29.700 --> 00:07:31.000
The radius of the circle is 6.

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:37.410
In the figure above, arc SBT is
1/4 of a circle with center

00:07:37.410 --> 00:07:38.390
R and radius 6.

00:07:38.390 --> 00:07:39.350
Fair enough.

00:07:39.350 --> 00:07:46.130
If the length plus the width
of rectangle ABCR is 8-- so

00:07:46.130 --> 00:07:49.740
the length plus the
width, so ABCR.

00:07:49.740 --> 00:07:52.100
So this is the width,
this is the length.

00:07:52.100 --> 00:07:57.390
So L plus W is equal to 8.

00:07:57.390 --> 00:08:01.220
What is the perimeter of
the shaded region?

00:08:01.220 --> 00:08:02.920
Fascinating.

00:08:02.920 --> 00:08:04.420
Let's do it step by step.

00:08:04.420 --> 00:08:07.140
First we can just figure out
what this part of the

00:08:07.140 --> 00:08:08.310
perimeter is.

00:08:08.310 --> 00:08:11.440
And that's the easiest
part, right?

00:08:11.440 --> 00:08:13.380
Because what's the perimeter
of the whole circle?

00:08:13.380 --> 00:08:15.450
Well, it's the circumference
of the whole circle.

00:08:15.450 --> 00:08:18.170
Circumference is equal
to 2 pi r.

00:08:18.170 --> 00:08:20.210
This is the whole circle
we're talking about.

00:08:20.210 --> 00:08:25.000
So that's equal to 2 pi times
6, so that's equal to 12 pi.

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:26.950
This is the circumference of
the whole circle, so the

00:08:26.950 --> 00:08:30.880
circumference of this arc, of
this piece, is going to be 1/4

00:08:30.880 --> 00:08:33.610
of that, because it's 1/4
of the whole circle.

00:08:33.610 --> 00:08:37.860
So it's 1/4 of 12 pi,
so that's 3 pi.

00:08:37.860 --> 00:08:40.690
Now, what we need to be able
to figure out is L and W,

00:08:40.690 --> 00:08:43.559
because if we can figure out
L and W, we can figure out

00:08:43.559 --> 00:08:47.600
everything else about
this circle.

00:08:47.600 --> 00:08:49.720
And actually, I'm going to
continue this problem in the

00:08:49.720 --> 00:08:52.430
next video, because I think it
might get a little involved,

00:08:52.430 --> 00:08:53.890
and I don't want you to
get too confused.

00:08:53.890 --> 00:08:55.140
I'll see you in the next video.
