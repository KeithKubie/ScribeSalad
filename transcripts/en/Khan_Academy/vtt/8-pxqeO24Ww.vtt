00:00:04.836 --> 00:00:06.367
- Hi, I'm Sal Khan, founder of the

00:00:06.367 --> 00:00:08.340
not-for-profit Khan Academy,

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:10.590
and I have some very exciting news.

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:12.464
The data is in from our first year

00:00:12.464 --> 00:00:15.121
of the partnership between
us and the College Board

00:00:15.121 --> 00:00:19.008
around Khan Academy being the
official practice for the SAT.

00:00:19.008 --> 00:00:20.344
And what we're seeing is,

00:00:20.344 --> 00:00:21.853
students who spent an average

00:00:21.853 --> 00:00:24.657
of 20 hours of practice on Khan Academy

00:00:24.657 --> 00:00:27.407
are seeing roughly 115-point gain

00:00:28.302 --> 00:00:30.909
between the PSAT and the SAT.

00:00:30.909 --> 00:00:32.714
And to put that into perspective,

00:00:32.714 --> 00:00:34.493
that's roughly twice the point gain

00:00:34.493 --> 00:00:38.749
that students typically see
between the PSAT and the SAT.

00:00:38.749 --> 00:00:40.551
And what's especially heartening

00:00:40.551 --> 00:00:44.547
is that we're seeing that gain
be consistent across gender,

00:00:44.547 --> 00:00:47.821
race, and socioeconomic groups.

00:00:47.821 --> 00:00:50.355
And so this makes us feel really good,

00:00:50.355 --> 00:00:52.095
not just from the Khan
Academy point of view,

00:00:52.095 --> 00:00:53.933
or the College Board point of view,

00:00:53.933 --> 00:00:55.927
but just in the overall theme

00:00:55.927 --> 00:00:58.447
of being able to help
level the playing field.

00:00:58.447 --> 00:01:00.887
Students take the PSAT, they can sync

00:01:00.887 --> 00:01:02.972
those accounts with the Khan Academy,

00:01:02.972 --> 00:01:06.303
Khan Academy software then
has the information necessary

00:01:06.303 --> 00:01:08.243
to essentially do weak point training.

00:01:08.243 --> 00:01:10.769
Know where you need
practice, not just in math,

00:01:10.769 --> 00:01:12.486
but in reading and writing as well.

00:01:12.486 --> 00:01:14.484
And you get that practice so that

00:01:14.484 --> 00:01:16.169
you can put your best foot forward

00:01:16.169 --> 00:01:18.191
not just on the SAT, but to be

00:01:18.191 --> 00:01:21.478
optimally prepared for
college, and for life.

00:01:21.478 --> 00:01:25.260
So this is exciting news,
it's also just the beginning,

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:26.958
and we hope to work with all of you,

00:01:26.958 --> 00:01:28.912
students, parents, teachers,

00:01:28.912 --> 00:01:31.137
to further level the playing field

00:01:31.137 --> 00:01:33.554
for college and life access.
