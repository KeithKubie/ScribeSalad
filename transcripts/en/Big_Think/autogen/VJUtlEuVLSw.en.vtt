00:00:05.599 --> 00:00:05.609
 

00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:08.610
addiction is compulsive behavior despite

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:08.620
addiction is compulsive behavior despite
 

00:00:08.620 --> 00:00:11.220
addiction is compulsive behavior despite
negative consequences and it's really

00:00:11.220 --> 00:00:11.230
negative consequences and it's really
 

00:00:11.230 --> 00:00:13.230
negative consequences and it's really
important to start by defining addiction

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:13.240
important to start by defining addiction
 

00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:15.090
important to start by defining addiction
because for a long time we really

00:00:15.090 --> 00:00:15.100
because for a long time we really
 

00:00:15.100 --> 00:00:17.849
because for a long time we really
defined it very poorly we used to think

00:00:17.849 --> 00:00:17.859
defined it very poorly we used to think
 

00:00:17.859 --> 00:00:20.490
defined it very poorly we used to think
that addiction was needing a substance

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:20.500
that addiction was needing a substance
 

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:23.730
that addiction was needing a substance
to function and what that resulted in

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:23.740
to function and what that resulted in
 

00:00:23.740 --> 00:00:26.130
to function and what that resulted in
was that cocaine was not addictive

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:26.140
was that cocaine was not addictive
 

00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:28.319
was that cocaine was not addictive
because cocaine does not produce

00:00:28.319 --> 00:00:28.329
because cocaine does not produce
 

00:00:28.329 --> 00:00:31.100
because cocaine does not produce
physical withdrawal that is noticeable

00:00:31.100 --> 00:00:31.110
physical withdrawal that is noticeable
 

00:00:31.110 --> 00:00:35.700
physical withdrawal that is noticeable
you may be cranky and irritable and

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:35.710
you may be cranky and irritable and
 

00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:39.030
you may be cranky and irritable and
crave cocaine but you won't be puking

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:39.040
crave cocaine but you won't be puking
 

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:41.730
crave cocaine but you won't be puking
and shaking and have the classic

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:41.740
and shaking and have the classic
 

00:00:41.740 --> 00:00:43.830
and shaking and have the classic
symptoms that you would see with alcohol

00:00:43.830 --> 00:00:43.840
symptoms that you would see with alcohol
 

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:46.650
symptoms that you would see with alcohol
or heroin withdrawal so cocaine wasn't

00:00:46.650 --> 00:00:46.660
or heroin withdrawal so cocaine wasn't
 

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:50.370
or heroin withdrawal so cocaine wasn't
addictive then crack came and we

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:50.380
addictive then crack came and we
 

00:00:50.380 --> 00:00:52.740
addictive then crack came and we
realized that defining addiction in that

00:00:52.740 --> 00:00:52.750
realized that defining addiction in that
 

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:57.450
realized that defining addiction in that
way not only harms people by telling

00:00:57.450 --> 00:00:57.460
way not only harms people by telling
 

00:00:57.460 --> 00:00:59.310
way not only harms people by telling
them that cocaine is not addictive it

00:00:59.310 --> 00:00:59.320
them that cocaine is not addictive it
 

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:02.010
them that cocaine is not addictive it
also harms pain patients because people

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:02.020
also harms pain patients because people
 

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:04.979
also harms pain patients because people
who take opioids daily for pain will

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:04.989
who take opioids daily for pain will
 

00:01:04.989 --> 00:01:07.230
who take opioids daily for pain will
develop physical dependence but they are

00:01:07.230 --> 00:01:07.240
develop physical dependence but they are
 

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:10.109
develop physical dependence but they are
not addicted unless they have compulsive

00:01:10.109 --> 00:01:10.119
not addicted unless they have compulsive
 

00:01:10.119 --> 00:01:11.969
not addicted unless they have compulsive
behavior despite negative consequences

00:01:11.969 --> 00:01:11.979
behavior despite negative consequences
 

00:01:11.979 --> 00:01:14.520
behavior despite negative consequences
to me non drug addictions are really

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:14.530
to me non drug addictions are really
 

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:17.069
to me non drug addictions are really
really interesting because some people

00:01:17.069 --> 00:01:17.079
really interesting because some people
 

00:01:17.079 --> 00:01:19.080
really interesting because some people
have argued that drugs are addictive

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:19.090
have argued that drugs are addictive
 

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:21.109
have argued that drugs are addictive
because they change the brain and that

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:21.119
because they change the brain and that
 

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:23.520
because they change the brain and that
addiction results from a unique

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:23.530
addiction results from a unique
 

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:25.590
addiction results from a unique
pathology related to the particular

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:25.600
pathology related to the particular
 

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:28.349
pathology related to the particular
chemicals of the drugs it is certainly

00:01:28.349 --> 00:01:28.359
chemicals of the drugs it is certainly
 

00:01:28.359 --> 00:01:30.569
chemicals of the drugs it is certainly
the case that the chemistry matters but

00:01:30.569 --> 00:01:30.579
the case that the chemistry matters but
 

00:01:30.579 --> 00:01:32.910
the case that the chemistry matters but
addiction can occur completely without

00:01:32.910 --> 00:01:32.920
addiction can occur completely without
 

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:35.789
addiction can occur completely without
any external chemicals and the reason

00:01:35.789 --> 00:01:35.799
any external chemicals and the reason
 

00:01:35.799 --> 00:01:38.129
any external chemicals and the reason
that that happens is that addiction is

00:01:38.129 --> 00:01:38.139
that that happens is that addiction is
 

00:01:38.139 --> 00:01:40.260
that that happens is that addiction is
not simply exposure to a substance

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:40.270
not simply exposure to a substance
 

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:42.840
not simply exposure to a substance
addiction is a pattern of behavior and

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:42.850
addiction is a pattern of behavior and
 

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:45.149
addiction is a pattern of behavior and
certain patterns of experience are

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:45.159
certain patterns of experience are
 

00:01:45.159 --> 00:01:48.449
certain patterns of experience are
inherently addictive and gambling is a

00:01:48.449 --> 00:01:48.459
inherently addictive and gambling is a
 

00:01:48.459 --> 00:01:50.609
inherently addictive and gambling is a
good example of this because what

00:01:50.609 --> 00:01:50.619
good example of this because what
 

00:01:50.619 --> 00:01:52.709
good example of this because what
gambling does is it gives you

00:01:52.709 --> 00:01:52.719
gambling does is it gives you
 

00:01:52.719 --> 00:01:54.959
gambling does is it gives you
intermittent reinforcement and so you

00:01:54.959 --> 00:01:54.969
intermittent reinforcement and so you
 

00:01:54.969 --> 00:01:57.989
intermittent reinforcement and so you
know every unpredictable amount of times

00:01:57.989 --> 00:01:57.999
know every unpredictable amount of times
 

00:01:57.999 --> 00:02:03.569
know every unpredictable amount of times
you win and this is a puzzle to our

00:02:03.569 --> 00:02:03.579
you win and this is a puzzle to our
 

00:02:03.579 --> 00:02:06.330
you win and this is a puzzle to our
pattern-seeking brains and we keep

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:06.340
pattern-seeking brains and we keep
 

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:08.040
pattern-seeking brains and we keep
thinking we're gonna find a pattern and

00:02:08.040 --> 00:02:08.050
thinking we're gonna find a pattern and
 

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:09.240
thinking we're gonna find a pattern and
it's gonna sort out and we're going to

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:09.250
it's gonna sort out and we're going to
 

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:10.970
it's gonna sort out and we're going to
understand it and we're gonna get rich

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:10.980
understand it and we're gonna get rich
 

00:02:10.980 --> 00:02:14.309
understand it and we're gonna get rich
you know or we find that sort of the

00:02:14.309 --> 00:02:14.319
you know or we find that sort of the
 

00:02:14.319 --> 00:02:15.830
you know or we find that sort of the
constant immersion

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:15.840
constant immersion
 

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:18.530
constant immersion
in these ideas of you know that allow

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:18.540
in these ideas of you know that allow
 

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:19.850
in these ideas of you know that allow
you to escape while I got to do this I

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:19.860
you to escape while I got to do this I
 

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:23.509
you to escape while I got to do this I
gotta you know um is going to you know

00:02:23.509 --> 00:02:23.519
gotta you know um is going to you know
 

00:02:23.519 --> 00:02:26.059
gotta you know um is going to you know
soothe you and allow you to escape from

00:02:26.059 --> 00:02:26.069
soothe you and allow you to escape from
 

00:02:26.069 --> 00:02:27.410
soothe you and allow you to escape from
your life and stuff like this

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:27.420
your life and stuff like this
 

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:29.780
your life and stuff like this
I mean I think it I think gambling is

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:29.790
I mean I think it I think gambling is
 

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:31.729
I mean I think it I think gambling is
also really interesting because we've

00:02:31.729 --> 00:02:31.739
also really interesting because we've
 

00:02:31.739 --> 00:02:33.530
also really interesting because we've
had an enormous explosion in the

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:33.540
had an enormous explosion in the
 

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:37.070
had an enormous explosion in the
availability of gambling but we have not

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:37.080
availability of gambling but we have not
 

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:40.160
availability of gambling but we have not
had enormous explosion of gambling

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:40.170
had enormous explosion of gambling
 

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:42.410
had enormous explosion of gambling
addictions and again this is because the

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:42.420
addictions and again this is because the
 

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:44.839
addictions and again this is because the
population rate there's only a certain

00:02:44.839 --> 00:02:44.849
population rate there's only a certain
 

00:02:44.849 --> 00:02:47.680
population rate there's only a certain
percent of people who will be vulnerable

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:47.690
percent of people who will be vulnerable
 

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:50.089
percent of people who will be vulnerable
now you can make more of those people by

00:02:50.089 --> 00:02:50.099
now you can make more of those people by
 

00:02:50.099 --> 00:02:51.860
now you can make more of those people by
traumatising them and taking away their

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:51.870
traumatising them and taking away their
 

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:57.050
traumatising them and taking away their
economic you know ways of living but you

00:02:57.050 --> 00:02:57.060
economic you know ways of living but you
 

00:02:57.060 --> 00:02:58.970
economic you know ways of living but you
can't create them by providing more

00:02:58.970 --> 00:02:58.980
can't create them by providing more
 

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:00.710
can't create them by providing more
substances or more addictive

00:03:00.710 --> 00:03:00.720
substances or more addictive
 

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:03.130
substances or more addictive
