00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
The first option is the correct one.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:07.000
You bring 3 times the derivative of x minus 4x over to the right hand side

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:15.000
and write the derivative of x as y, so this becomes y and the second derivative of becomes

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:24.000
the first derivative of y, so we end up with the first derivative of y=7-3y+4x.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.000
This is the standard trick to convert higher order differential equations

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.000
into first order systems of differential equations.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:38.000
You maybe asking--why are we not using the second one. The solver needs the rate of change.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:44.000
It provides x and y, the current values so that function should depend on x and y

00:00:44.000 --> 99:59:59.999
and not on the rate of change, which is to be determined.
