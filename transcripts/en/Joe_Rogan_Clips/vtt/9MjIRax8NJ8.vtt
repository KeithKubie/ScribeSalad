1
00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:04.080
The general good experience. That's the thing, right? It's like,

2
00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:09.450
are you responsible for the people who also comment on your post?

3
00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:10.770
And th this is,

4
00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:15.300
this is where we're getting to this like Vox thing that's happening with Steven

5
00:00:15.300 --> 00:00:19.500
Crowder right now. Right? Are you responsible for the reaction to what you post?

6
00:00:19.620 --> 00:00:22.680
Because if you look at what Steven Crowder said to that, if we don't,

7
00:00:22.770 --> 00:00:23.760
people don't know the story.

8
00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:29.060
Steven Crowder got into it with this guy who is a writer for Vox who,

9
00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:35.220
uh, is, he's gay. His Twitter handle is gay wank.

10
00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:38.830
Maza yeah. So it's not that he's hiding that he's gay.

11
00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:42.090
He talks about it all the time. He's kind of a feminine.

12
00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:47.360
And Steven Crowder mock that and he mock that in these videos where he was

13
00:00:49.650 --> 00:00:51.140
criticizing Carlos.

14
00:00:51.630 --> 00:00:55.380
His position on Antifa is specifically what I saw.

15
00:00:55.770 --> 00:01:00.320
And in, in doing that, he called him, uh,

16
00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:04.680
this queer Mexican, this like, and he's doing it in a ribbing way.

17
00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:05.730
He's doing it in a joking way.

18
00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:11.090
And then Carlos Mazda posts all these horrible tweets that came his way.

19
00:01:12.781 --> 00:01:14.850
And apparently he got docs so people got his phone.

20
00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:16.110
And they were saying debates.

21
00:01:16.111 --> 00:01:20.090
Steven Crowder was getting all these text messages in and all this, uh,

22
00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:23.820
hateful stuff that was coming his way. So the question is,

23
00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:27.180
who is responsible for that hateful stuff?

24
00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:31.590
If Steven Crowder calls him queer is what is queer?

25
00:01:32.010 --> 00:01:35.520
Okay, is LBGTQ, what do we do there?

26
00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:39.390
What do we do if the cue is an Izzy is,

27
00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:41.700
is it okay to call someone gay who identifies as gay?

28
00:01:41.701 --> 00:01:45.510
If he calls him the gay little Mexican? Is that, is that right?

29
00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:49.480
<v 1>Bad? Like what is, how bad is that? Like what is that like? I'm saying,</v>

30
00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:51.140
but so do you feel what I'm saying here? It's like,

31
00:01:51.150 --> 00:01:54.040
do I know where you're getting at? Let's zoom out a little bit and then we'll,

32
00:01:54.041 --> 00:01:56.770
we'll get into this. Okay. Man, where do you even start with this?

33
00:01:56.920 --> 00:01:58.930
Because there's a lot to unpack here, right?

34
00:01:59.620 --> 00:02:02.560
If we will analyze the specifics in a second maybe,

35
00:02:02.561 --> 00:02:07.150
but first if you look at the policy, the terms of service of YouTube,

36
00:02:07.151 --> 00:02:10.030
there's a verge article from yesterday before, a few days ago,

37
00:02:10.031 --> 00:02:14.290
earlier this week before YouTube had made the decision to demonetize Steven

38
00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:14.290
Crowder.

39
00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:18.100
<v 0>Well they made the decision to not act and just say that it didn't violate the</v>

40
00:02:18.101 --> 00:02:20.650
terms of services and then today as I got in here,

41
00:02:20.651 --> 00:02:23.000
Jamie informed me that they made a decision to Monde.

42
00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:27.470
<v 1>That's right. So in the article where they made the decision not to act,</v>

43
00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:33.070
they actually put what YouTube terms of service are with regard to bullying and

44
00:02:33.291 --> 00:02:36.470
harassment. My reading of it and we could go through them.

45
00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:38.820
If we could pull them up, we could go through it line by line if we wanted.

46
00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:43.460
My reading was that the, that definitely did break the terms and conditions.

47
00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:47.660
That was my view as I looked at what it was that was done by Steven Crowder and

48
00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:49.820
what the terms of service are. Just matching it up,

49
00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:53.180
not looking at the comments from either poses specifically.

50
00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:58.070
It was specifically targeting an individual.

51
00:02:58.100 --> 00:02:59.920
On the basis of sexual orientation,

52
00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:02.380
<v 0>but he wasn't targeting them on the basis of it.</v>

53
00:03:02.381 --> 00:03:04.930
He was mentioning that with his bad ideas,

54
00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:09.310
he was targeting his bad ideas in regards to Antifa a lot of that he was

55
00:03:09.311 --> 00:03:11.880
dismissing Antifa. But if you look at Crowder's video, uh,

56
00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:14.080
and I can't believe I spent so much time doing this,

57
00:03:14.081 --> 00:03:17.550
but it's not like a whole hour on this two days ago. Yeah. Um,

58
00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:22.830
he was talking about how Carlos just dismisses Antifa as being not that big a

59
00:03:23.261 --> 00:03:27.040
deal and that there's bias in the media whenever there's anything negative that

60
00:03:27.041 --> 00:03:28.780
happens. But if you look at the overall picture,

61
00:03:28.990 --> 00:03:31.270
and then Crowder goes on to talk about all the assaults,

62
00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:34.090
all the murders that there was sexual assaults, there was rapes,

63
00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:36.940
there was all these things that happen with Antifa.

64
00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:40.510
He was talking about all these different people that got maced in the face.

65
00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:44.890
All of these people that got hurt and, and he's highlighting all,

66
00:03:44.891 --> 00:03:47.440
like this is not something to easily dismiss. Sure.

67
00:03:47.441 --> 00:03:50.470
And that the FBI had labeled Antifa a terrorist organization. So,

68
00:03:50.471 --> 00:03:53.410
so far it's just politics. It's just what, what does he think?

69
00:03:53.411 --> 00:03:57.490
What do I think so far it's just that part of it. And along the way he's like,

70
00:03:57.491 --> 00:04:01.270
yeah, but the queer little Latino says this. Yeah. And when he does that,

71
00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:04.510
that's where it's like, okay, what is he doing? Is he ma?

72
00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:08.020
He's kind of mocking him. Right. And he's mocking him by saying he's queer,

73
00:04:08.021 --> 00:04:10.930
but he says he's queer or he says he's gay. Yeah. But that's like saying,

74
00:04:10.931 --> 00:04:13.900
I mean listen, just because theN word is in rap songs,

75
00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:17.170
it doesn't mean that any that that defined to go and write,

76
00:04:17.171 --> 00:04:18.820
but the N word is not in like,

77
00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:23.020
it's not like then the LBGT N, you know what I'm saying?

78
00:04:23.021 --> 00:04:25.460
It's not like a part of their, their organ. It's,

79
00:04:25.510 --> 00:04:30.510
I think the principle though is you're suggesting that because a certain word is

80
00:04:31.031 --> 00:04:36.031
sometimes used self referentially by members of a group that any use of it from

81
00:04:36.341 --> 00:04:40.660
the outside is by definition not problematic.

82
00:04:40.690 --> 00:04:43.270
And I'm just saying it's more complicated and you've got certainly more

83
00:04:43.271 --> 00:04:46.600
complicated. You do have to look at specifics. I'm G I'm going from memory,

84
00:04:46.601 --> 00:04:50.950
but wasn't Steven Crowder also wearing a shirt that said fags with the a with an

85
00:04:50.951 --> 00:04:54.040
astrophysics wink, wink, nudge nudge.

86
00:04:54.070 --> 00:04:59.070
It said socialism is for figs and Halley's calling a gay gay is a fig instead of

87
00:05:02.201 --> 00:05:06.230
a, an I as he's calling a gay guy acquitted in Mexico. Yes. Yeah.

88
00:05:06.250 --> 00:05:09.860
I mean in total it's not crazy. So, but no, there's,

89
00:05:10.220 --> 00:05:12.670
there's certainly an argument that, well,

90
00:05:12.671 --> 00:05:15.550
I don't necessarily think the tee shirt is for Carlos Mesa.

91
00:05:15.880 --> 00:05:18.640
I think that's a T shirt that he just has, cause he thinks it's funny.

92
00:05:18.940 --> 00:05:22.510
And because Che Guevara who is on the shirt is,

93
00:05:22.750 --> 00:05:25.420
that is one of the weirdest things that people worship. That guy,

94
00:05:25.450 --> 00:05:29.830
he was a horrific human being. A mass murderer, a terrible sociopath,

95
00:05:30.010 --> 00:05:33.880
a psychopath. And because he looks good and calls in the Cuban revolution,

96
00:05:34.060 --> 00:05:36.190
elders with the Baret on, you know, he's,

97
00:05:36.550 --> 00:05:40.600
he became for a long time. I mean, it's kind of died off,

98
00:05:40.601 --> 00:05:45.430
but he became like the Wolk poster boy. I'm from Argentina. I, I know.

99
00:05:45.740 --> 00:05:50.500
Uh, I, we born there. Yeah, no kidding. Yeah, sure. So, I mean, listen,

100
00:05:50.501 --> 00:05:54.340
here's all my country, bro. I'm, I made it. Um, so listen,

101
00:05:54.400 --> 00:05:58.010
I think that I, I've, I do appreciate what you're saying and I agree with you

102
00:05:58.010 --> 00:06:01.910
<v 1>to a certain extent. I believe that when YouTube yesterday said,</v>

103
00:06:02.480 --> 00:06:06.140
we looked at the content in total and we don't think it violates our terms and

104
00:06:06.141 --> 00:06:07.880
conditions. I disagreed with them.

105
00:06:07.910 --> 00:06:10.640
I thought it very clearly violated their terms and conditions.

106
00:06:11.450 --> 00:06:16.450
Where I am thinking about it now is the application of those terms and

107
00:06:17.181 --> 00:06:21.560
conditions violations. Because a similar thing happened with Alex Jones as well,

108
00:06:21.950 --> 00:06:26.950
which was there's lots of way smaller players that are violating these same

109
00:06:26.961 --> 00:06:29.750
terms and conditions, but nobody knows about them.

110
00:06:29.780 --> 00:06:30.920
YouTube doesn't know about them,

111
00:06:30.921 --> 00:06:33.350
they don't get any attention because they have no audience.

112
00:06:33.590 --> 00:06:37.220
So I think there's the question of the application of these terms and

113
00:06:37.221 --> 00:06:37.760
conditions,

114
00:06:37.760 --> 00:06:42.760
conditions in a way that's sort of fair and is not ultimately going by the

115
00:06:42.771 --> 00:06:47.771
public blow back or reaction to situations because that that's how ad pocalypse

116
00:06:48.381 --> 00:06:50.030
1.0 [inaudible] happened again,

117
00:06:50.060 --> 00:06:55.060
I think it was a Coke ad appeared on an obviously racist video on a channel with

118
00:06:56.301 --> 00:07:00.650
like 800 or a thousand subscribers. The wall street journal, I think it was,

119
00:07:00.651 --> 00:07:01.700
did an article saying,

120
00:07:01.760 --> 00:07:06.760
look at these screenshots of these advertisers on these crazy racist videos that

121
00:07:07.400 --> 00:07:11.720
led to blow back because YouTube didn't want to lose money and ultimately that's

122
00:07:11.721 --> 00:07:12.554
what this is about.

123
00:07:12.830 --> 00:07:16.280
I know that there are people who say YouTube has an inherently left wing bias.

124
00:07:16.550 --> 00:07:21.550
Others say YouTube has a of right-wing by whatever YouTube's bias is towards

125
00:07:22.520 --> 00:07:24.130
corporatism and profit. Yes.

126
00:07:24.230 --> 00:07:27.890
That's fundamentally what it is and as a company they have a left wing bias.

127
00:07:27.950 --> 00:07:30.950
I don't know that in what sense?

128
00:07:32.010 --> 00:07:36.750
<v 0>Well in the sense that the woman who's the CEO of YouTube was talked about it</v>

129
00:07:36.751 --> 00:07:39.000
pretty openly, like the fact that she doesn't,

130
00:07:39.450 --> 00:07:42.660
what was it that she had gotten into? What did she, Oh, well,

131
00:07:42.661 --> 00:07:45.470
first of all was the, the James Demore thing. You know,

132
00:07:45.560 --> 00:07:49.590
she was talking about the Google memo and she was talking about how it was, uh,

133
00:07:49.620 --> 00:07:52.620
incredibly damaging, damaging, uh,

134
00:07:52.800 --> 00:07:56.450
damaging stereotypes against women, which it just wasn't,

135
00:07:56.820 --> 00:07:57.820
<v 1>this is not accurate.</v>

136
00:07:57.880 --> 00:08:02.710
Is home Depot a right wing company because the CEO supports Trump?

137
00:08:03.400 --> 00:08:03.460
[inaudible]

138
00:08:03.460 --> 00:08:06.040
<v 0>that's a good question. Um, I'm basing it on that.</v>

139
00:08:06.220 --> 00:08:09.730
They're a part of Facebook and Facebook is pretty clearly left wing part of

140
00:08:09.760 --> 00:08:13.090
Facebook. Google, Oh, sorry. Google. They're part of Google. I meant Google.

141
00:08:13.180 --> 00:08:14.860
Okay. Google is a, a very,

142
00:08:14.861 --> 00:08:18.580
very left wing group and it's all Silicon Valley,

143
00:08:18.581 --> 00:08:20.950
which is almost entirely left wing biased.

144
00:08:21.070 --> 00:08:25.840
<v 1>So I think we have to distinguish between the personal political biases of</v>

145
00:08:25.841 --> 00:08:30.841
Silicon Valley entrepreneurs and the broader place that Google has in the sort

146
00:08:31.271 --> 00:08:32.710
of corporate sphere.

147
00:08:33.280 --> 00:08:38.280
Google is part of the group of huge multinational corporations that lobbies for

148
00:08:41.051 --> 00:08:45.280
particular tax policy to avoid paying taxes legally.

149
00:08:45.670 --> 00:08:50.670
That is not a particularly left wing thing to do. Uh, Google is, um,

150
00:08:50.710 --> 00:08:55.710
part of the large tech companies that in order to avoid serious regulation of

151
00:08:57.031 --> 00:09:01.470
their businesses have come up with this idea of regulating themselves. Okay.

152
00:09:01.500 --> 00:09:06.120
Which I know is a topic self-regulation that's come up before on your program in

153
00:09:06.240 --> 00:09:09.390
a variety of ways. So those are not left wing things.

154
00:09:09.391 --> 00:09:12.690
And if you want to make the case that as a company,

155
00:09:13.140 --> 00:09:17.430
it has a left wing politic in the outward facing world,

156
00:09:17.460 --> 00:09:21.930
you have to have something more than just a lot of their engineers live in Palo

157
00:09:21.930 --> 00:09:26.710
Alto and are hipsters who go to coffee shops. You think? I think that in the,

158
00:09:26.730 --> 00:09:31.730
in terms of the place that it occupies within the economic system we have,

159
00:09:32.640 --> 00:09:37.640
they are not very different from all of the large corporations that are pushing

160
00:09:39.241 --> 00:09:43.710
against regulation, pushing for ways to avoid taxes, period.

161
00:09:43.800 --> 00:09:47.880
So in terms of economic decisions, yeah. I mean, listen, if,

162
00:09:48.600 --> 00:09:53.600
if we want to talk about how the personal politics of the employees translate to

163
00:09:54.421 --> 00:09:56.010
policy, we can do that,

164
00:09:56.011 --> 00:09:59.520
but we need to be able to make some specific claims about how, how it does,

165
00:09:59.820 --> 00:10:04.820
what I'm saying is we know the way in which the structure that Google is a part

166
00:10:04.921 --> 00:10:09.120
of leads to it advocating for things that are center, right.

167
00:10:09.600 --> 00:10:13.620
Corporatist, capitalist, the status quo of tax shelters,

168
00:10:13.621 --> 00:10:18.420
havens and not paying taxes, regulating ourselves, et cetera, et cetera. Well,

169
00:10:18.421 --> 00:10:20.850
that's what's interesting about this Crowder thing is they're ultimately,

170
00:10:20.851 --> 00:10:25.851
the decision was to allow him to have his freedom to post videos on there.

171
00:10:26.640 --> 00:10:31.010
But the punitive aspect of it is they're gonna reduce his ability or eliminated

172
00:10:31.011 --> 00:10:33.720
his ability to make money from it. Well, I should say reduce, right?

173
00:10:33.721 --> 00:10:38.250
Because he could, couldn't he put videos, put ads up in his video?

174
00:10:38.430 --> 00:10:43.410
Yeah, I mean, you can add. So like we, one, one thing that I do is we,

175
00:10:43.830 --> 00:10:43.950
uh,

176
00:10:43.950 --> 00:10:48.480
we kind of split off the ad sales from my show into an ad agency and we're doing

177
00:10:48.481 --> 00:10:51.330
ad sales, not just for my show but for other shows as well.

178
00:10:51.600 --> 00:10:56.600
And those include ad placements that are not like the pre-roll ads on YouTube.

179
00:10:56.821 --> 00:11:00.020
It's, the host is actually talking about a product or whatever. Right.

180
00:11:00.090 --> 00:11:03.390
It's a re, you know, alive read sort of thing. Unbox therapy does a lot of that.

181
00:11:04.010 --> 00:11:07.440
Hm. Yeah. That's where I first saw those who does some pretty extensive ones.

182
00:11:07.470 --> 00:11:10.470
Okay. So of course you can do that. I mean, yeah, the,

183
00:11:10.471 --> 00:11:11.820
there's nothing he can do that,

184
00:11:12.060 --> 00:11:16.620
but he can't just collect revenue like I assume he's been doing before.

185
00:11:16.920 --> 00:11:20.250
He has a significant number of followers. I think his, uh,

186
00:11:20.310 --> 00:11:25.070
his YouTube subscribers are more than three and a half million. So it's,

187
00:11:25.110 --> 00:11:26.240
it's very high. Yeah.

188
00:11:26.460 --> 00:11:30.780
More than me and Dave just eliminated his income. Right.

189
00:11:30.850 --> 00:11:35.760
Comes out of YouTube. And this was their decision based on his,

190
00:11:36.360 --> 00:11:40.160
his way of talking about Carlos Mesa.

191
00:11:41.280 --> 00:11:45.000
That's, that's what happened. Yeah. I mean, so what, what are the concerns?

192
00:11:45.001 --> 00:11:48.750
To me it's not that he didn't violate terms and conditions. Like I said,

193
00:11:48.751 --> 00:11:52.110
I think he pretty clearly did the concerns to me are, um,

194
00:11:52.660 --> 00:11:57.660
is YouTube only going to even look into these circumstances or instances when

195
00:12:00.520 --> 00:12:04.480
there is a public outcry? The answer is probably yes.

196
00:12:04.481 --> 00:12:06.970
Because why would they look into stuff nobody's paying attention to.

197
00:12:06.971 --> 00:12:07.804
It's not a good change.

198
00:12:07.970 --> 00:12:12.460
Their decision based on public outcry based on Carlos Mays's reaction to the

199
00:12:12.461 --> 00:12:16.150
initial decision. I happen to think their initial decision was the wrong one.

200
00:12:16.210 --> 00:12:18.520
But I have a sort of broader concern here,

201
00:12:18.521 --> 00:12:21.880
which is about the fairness of the application and also the distinguishing

202
00:12:21.881 --> 00:12:26.881
between a content that is promoting whatever falls under any of our definitions

203
00:12:29.411 --> 00:12:33.280
of hateful or whatever content and those who are fighting against it.

204
00:12:33.330 --> 00:12:38.330
<v 0>So is it because he mentioned his sexual orientation and that he called him a</v>

205
00:12:40.051 --> 00:12:43.320
list B little queer or whatever. You call them, more queer Mexican.

206
00:12:43.980 --> 00:12:48.810
And if he just called him a fucking idiot and he received the exact same amount

207
00:12:48.811 --> 00:12:51.930
of hate, would you still think that that was a good move?

208
00:12:52.360 --> 00:12:52.991
<v 1>No. I mean,</v>

209
00:12:52.991 --> 00:12:57.991
I think that it would not fall under what they are now claiming as the

210
00:12:58.661 --> 00:13:01.360
justification for the demonetization. It would be different.

211
00:13:01.770 --> 00:13:03.270
<v 0>It would have the same result.</v>

212
00:13:03.300 --> 00:13:06.540
The only difference would be they wouldn't be attacking his sexual orientation

213
00:13:06.541 --> 00:13:09.270
specifically because of crowd. That's the only difference.

214
00:13:11.490 --> 00:13:15.340
It's policing speech, you know? It really is. Here's

215
00:13:15.560 --> 00:13:20.380
<v 1>so, so who gets to decide if not the private businesses,</v>

216
00:13:20.500 --> 00:13:23.260
<v 0>what their rules are. That's where the real question comes up. Right?</v>

217
00:13:24.250 --> 00:13:26.500
Tulsi Gabbert believes that it's a first amendment issue and she believes that

218
00:13:26.501 --> 00:13:28.360
everyone should have the freedom of expression.

219
00:13:28.720 --> 00:13:30.940
And then as long as you're not doing anything illegal,

220
00:13:31.240 --> 00:13:34.630
you're not putting anyone in danger by giving up their address or doxing them or

221
00:13:34.631 --> 00:13:39.100
something along those lines or making overt physical threats that you should be

222
00:13:39.101 --> 00:13:42.670
allowed to do that because that's what the freedom of speech is all about.

223
00:13:42.671 --> 00:13:47.671
And freedom of speech when you eliminate social media in this country is your,

224
00:13:48.220 --> 00:13:51.970
your, your freedom is basically, yes. Yelling, yelling out in public.

225
00:13:51.971 --> 00:13:55.500
I mean you're, you're, we're in this weird place. It's a, what's it called, sir,

226
00:13:55.900 --> 00:13:56.501
as a culture,

227
00:13:56.501 --> 00:14:00.820
it's unprecedented really in terms of the waters we're navigating right now.

228
00:14:00.880 --> 00:14:04.180
<v 1>There's a couple of different things to F. so I like the principal,</v>

229
00:14:04.181 --> 00:14:05.560
like my principal is,

230
00:14:06.010 --> 00:14:10.270
we do almost no moderation on any of our platforms that my program is on.

231
00:14:10.960 --> 00:14:15.960
My only thing that I tell my team is if you see something that really seems to

232
00:14:16.511 --> 00:14:20.470
be illegal, it's calling for violence, it, whatever the these are,

233
00:14:20.530 --> 00:14:24.550
we have a very, very high bar before we will remove anything. And quite frankly,

234
00:14:24.670 --> 00:14:25.503
we're just too busy.

235
00:14:25.600 --> 00:14:27.230
<v 0>What did, what do you mean by that? I'm just, I'm confused.</v>

236
00:14:27.231 --> 00:14:30.140
Like who's not your videos? Who's video?

237
00:14:30.280 --> 00:14:33.820
<v 1>Yeah. And so if we find out that on our videos,</v>

238
00:14:33.850 --> 00:14:37.470
someone is posting endless comments [inaudible] in the comments.

239
00:14:37.480 --> 00:14:40.960
Second comments. My personal view is if it's not illegal, I just,

240
00:14:41.020 --> 00:14:43.510
just let it all be there and yeah, that's my personal view.

241
00:14:43.511 --> 00:14:44.770
And that's a great principle to have.

242
00:14:44.800 --> 00:14:48.190
<v 0>Well we don't touch them. We leave them alone even though we get accused of it.</v>

243
00:14:48.430 --> 00:14:52.100
But the, the question is YouTube at one point in time

244
00:14:52.310 --> 00:14:55.160
<v 1>had thrown out there that they were going to make people responsible for the</v>

245
00:14:55.161 --> 00:14:57.680
things that were in their comments. I vaguely remember that.

246
00:14:57.681 --> 00:15:00.680
But it didn't ultimately happen backed out of it very quickly when they realized

247
00:15:00.681 --> 00:15:01.880
that places like yours,

248
00:15:02.150 --> 00:15:06.260
which like your average video gets how many thousands of comments a lot and many

249
00:15:06.261 --> 00:15:08.330
of them antisemitic. And how would you, yeah.

250
00:15:08.331 --> 00:15:10.460
And how would you even be able to look at all those?

251
00:15:10.461 --> 00:15:11.600
I mean you would have to be 24,

252
00:15:11.601 --> 00:15:14.900
seven monitoring 'em cause you've also got people that are watching your videos

253
00:15:14.901 --> 00:15:16.970
from overseas at all times in the night. Yup.

254
00:15:17.300 --> 00:15:22.300
So I think that the principle of only only illegal content will be removed is

255
00:15:22.401 --> 00:15:26.420
great. That's a PR. That's my personal principle. However,

256
00:15:26.930 --> 00:15:31.930
I think that there is no serious case to be made that a private company,

257
00:15:32.730 --> 00:15:37.130
uh, can't say these are our terms of service. And if you want to,

258
00:15:37.131 --> 00:15:39.410
I mean it's sort of almost a conservative principle, right?

259
00:15:39.411 --> 00:15:42.560
The idea that unless illegal things are going on,

260
00:15:42.990 --> 00:15:46.820
we are not going to tell a business how it is that it should be run.

261
00:15:46.821 --> 00:15:51.200
And that's where I think a lot of right-wingers start to stumble on this issue

262
00:15:51.201 --> 00:15:55.430
because they're calling for a very invasive form of government regulation.

263
00:15:56.090 --> 00:16:00.290
They're calling for the government to step in and even break up these

264
00:16:00.291 --> 00:16:02.000
organizations because they've gotten too large.

265
00:16:02.160 --> 00:16:03.740
But you're hearing that from the left as well. Yeah.

266
00:16:03.810 --> 00:16:04.830
Well I think there's a diff,

267
00:16:04.850 --> 00:16:08.360
there's a difference though between Elizabeth Warren saying we should separate

268
00:16:08.420 --> 00:16:13.420
the social platform Facebook from the ad sales revenue generating piece of it.

269
00:16:16.190 --> 00:16:18.590
That's one thing that falls under antitrust.

270
00:16:18.830 --> 00:16:22.430
That's different than saying the government should come in and it should tell

271
00:16:22.431 --> 00:16:26.330
anybody who runs a social network that you can't even,

272
00:16:26.360 --> 00:16:31.040
you can't do anything unless the content is illegal because there are financial

273
00:16:31.041 --> 00:16:34.850
considerations, right? I mean there's lots of content that would not be illegal,

274
00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:38.300
but it would make a platform, a video platform like YouTube,

275
00:16:38.360 --> 00:16:41.510
not financially viable because advertisers would see it and they'd say, Oh,

276
00:16:41.511 --> 00:16:42.770
we're not going near that. Right,

277
00:16:42.890 --> 00:16:47.890
so I have a very hard time taking what is a very authoritarian perspective that

278
00:16:48.681 --> 00:16:50.360
the government should come in and say,

279
00:16:50.361 --> 00:16:54.650
this is how social networks should be run. Now if you want to change the law,

280
00:16:54.830 --> 00:16:55.940
here's the way it could be done.

281
00:16:56.480 --> 00:17:00.170
If you want to change the law and argue that these platforms have gotten so big

282
00:17:00.740 --> 00:17:04.490
that they represent more of a town square, so to speak,

283
00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:09.650
then okay, maybe you could pass a law that changes how they would be regulated,

284
00:17:09.950 --> 00:17:13.790
but that's typically the type of stuff the Rite is against because it is more

285
00:17:13.791 --> 00:17:16.520
regulation. It is more regulation,

286
00:17:16.521 --> 00:17:20.420
but it's regulation to keep a private company from regulating against free

287
00:17:20.421 --> 00:17:23.480
speech. Do you see what I'm saying? It's, it's a sneaky kind of regulation.

288
00:17:23.481 --> 00:17:28.070
It's a regulation that's enforcing the first amendment and the people's ability

289
00:17:28.071 --> 00:17:29.300
to freely express themselves.

290
00:17:29.540 --> 00:17:34.310
If we're admitting or if we're agreeing that we are entering into this new

291
00:17:34.311 --> 00:17:36.200
world. Yes. Where this is I,

292
00:17:36.201 --> 00:17:39.770
that's my position is that it is a town square and I feel like everybody should

293
00:17:39.771 --> 00:17:41.150
be able to communicate.

294
00:17:41.900 --> 00:17:46.900
The really unfortunate unsavory aspect of it is when someone gets harassed like

295
00:17:48.320 --> 00:17:49.170
Carlos Mesa was because of this,

296
00:17:49.171 --> 00:17:53.080
where people are sending him all these homophobic tweets and all the,

297
00:17:53.260 --> 00:17:55.860
and he's getting text messages and all this shit that's,

298
00:17:55.890 --> 00:18:00.840
that's the unsavory and unfortunate aspect of it. And how do you stop that?

299
00:18:00.870 --> 00:18:03.540
I don't know how you stop it. I don't know exactly how you stop it,

300
00:18:03.541 --> 00:18:05.280
but I think it would be useful.

301
00:18:05.430 --> 00:18:09.150
I mean one thing is when does a platform get big enough in your mind that it

302
00:18:09.151 --> 00:18:13.320
would qualify for this? Like town square designation? Well for sure YouTube.

303
00:18:14.040 --> 00:18:15.850
Let's talk about that one because that's the one we're on.

304
00:18:15.851 --> 00:18:18.660
I mean fucking God damn it. It's huge. It's gigantic.

305
00:18:18.690 --> 00:18:23.690
So are there other types of businesses through which communication happens that

306
00:18:24.871 --> 00:18:28.350
you think should be regulated in the same way? That's not really clear.

307
00:18:28.351 --> 00:18:29.400
So I'll give an example. Okay.

308
00:18:30.060 --> 00:18:35.060
If you start regularly sending people via ups,

309
00:18:36.300 --> 00:18:36.330
uh,

310
00:18:36.330 --> 00:18:41.330
similar things to some of the content that exists on YouTube and ups says we're

311
00:18:42.961 --> 00:18:46.290
getting reports that you're sending people harassing stuff.

312
00:18:46.560 --> 00:18:49.320
We don't want you as a customer here anymore. Here's a question though,

313
00:18:49.321 --> 00:18:52.470
isn't there a difference between someone sending something to a physical address

314
00:18:52.770 --> 00:18:54.120
and someone sending something?

315
00:18:54.480 --> 00:18:58.860
Let's say to you when your social media apps are on the third page of your phone

316
00:18:59.160 --> 00:19:01.620
and you have to swipe all the way over to get them and open it up and you have

317
00:19:01.621 --> 00:19:03.150
to read them. If you want to find them,

318
00:19:03.300 --> 00:19:05.160
well you don't necessarily have to read them.

319
00:19:05.220 --> 00:19:06.900
There's a difference in a practical sense,

320
00:19:06.901 --> 00:19:09.900
but I guess the question is would we want the government,

321
00:19:09.930 --> 00:19:14.070
would you similarly want the government to enforce for telephone companies?

322
00:19:14.130 --> 00:19:18.480
If you are harassment, getting harassing texts and you report it and report it,

323
00:19:18.690 --> 00:19:19.890
that's a different thing I think.

324
00:19:20.160 --> 00:19:23.490
I think what is coming to your phone and the phone is ringing.

325
00:19:23.520 --> 00:19:27.960
I think that's a another step. It's another step towards invasive.

326
00:19:28.260 --> 00:19:31.530
It's a big gray area. Yes. Is the phone ringing? Is it a phone call?

327
00:19:31.531 --> 00:19:35.100
Is it a text? Is it a WhatsApp message? You have to read that text, right? Yeah,

328
00:19:35.130 --> 00:19:38.220
no, I feel you. I guess the question where I hesitate,

329
00:19:38.340 --> 00:19:42.420
and again I'm speaking as someone from the left who believes regulation of

330
00:19:42.421 --> 00:19:44.250
businesses is an important thing.

331
00:19:44.970 --> 00:19:49.970
I would want to be really sure about how it exactly it is that the government

332
00:19:50.911 --> 00:19:55.911
would step in and mandate essentially that their view has to be listened to over

333
00:19:57.631 --> 00:20:00.810
the terms of service that a private company would wish to have. Yes.

334
00:20:01.260 --> 00:20:03.480
I feel like when you give people a gun,

335
00:20:03.481 --> 00:20:06.450
they start looking for targets and that that is a very common thing.

336
00:20:06.490 --> 00:20:10.170
If you give people the ability to censor and give people the ability to sensor

337
00:20:10.171 --> 00:20:13.770
based on their political ideology or based on what they feel is offensive,

338
00:20:13.860 --> 00:20:17.760
where other people don't, it's a slippery slope and I think that that can,

339
00:20:17.880 --> 00:20:22.200
that can lead to all sorts. Look that woman,

340
00:20:22.620 --> 00:20:26.070
what is her name again? The one who tried to get Amy Siskind.

341
00:20:26.130 --> 00:20:28.890
Imagine her being in charge of a social media platform.

342
00:20:28.891 --> 00:20:31.740
She tried to get you fired from Boston college for something that was incredibly

343
00:20:31.741 --> 00:20:35.940
polite. Right. That is what I'm talking about. Is that very action,

344
00:20:35.941 --> 00:20:40.380
that very same type of thinking that she tried to impose on you?

345
00:20:40.620 --> 00:20:41.700
That's what I'm worried about.

346
00:20:41.960 --> 00:20:45.360
Well they're worried about people that are really strictly trying to promote

347
00:20:45.361 --> 00:20:48.130
their ideologies and what they think is okay and

348
00:20:48.130 --> 00:20:52.540
<v 0>not okay and it's very slippery cause there's a lot of weird people out there</v>

349
00:20:52.541 --> 00:20:55.930
that believe a lot of weird things and want other people to conform to those

350
00:20:55.931 --> 00:20:56.764
weird things.

351
00:20:57.160 --> 00:21:01.570
And we sort of have to decide like that's why I'm bringing up this Crowder

352
00:21:01.571 --> 00:21:04.630
thing. Like do I think that what he said was good? No,

353
00:21:04.631 --> 00:21:07.990
it's not nice to call someone a little less be queer. It's not nice.

354
00:21:07.991 --> 00:21:09.460
It's kind of mean, you know?

355
00:21:09.461 --> 00:21:11.590
And especially when that guy wasn't even engaging with him.

356
00:21:11.740 --> 00:21:14.380
But he's making fun of him. He's a comedy show. He's mocking them.

357
00:21:14.530 --> 00:21:15.910
So the question becomes like, when,

358
00:21:16.090 --> 00:21:21.010
when is that mocking considered homophobic and when is it just ribbing? Right.

359
00:21:21.090 --> 00:21:23.380
And that's his position. His position is that it's just ribbing.

360
00:21:23.470 --> 00:21:28.470
<v 1>This is the problem with a discussion that is only about the principles.</v>

361
00:21:28.511 --> 00:21:32.560
So like a lot of our conversation for the last 15 minutes has been what is our

362
00:21:33.310 --> 00:21:37.690
principle about what types of business regulation is okay for the government to

363
00:21:37.691 --> 00:21:41.500
do and is not okay. Or when we talk about free speech,

364
00:21:41.740 --> 00:21:42.910
what should it do?

365
00:21:42.911 --> 00:21:46.990
We have a principle of anything short of illegal content versus something that

366
00:21:46.991 --> 00:21:51.700
is more strict. The reality is that it's, there is more gray area

367
00:21:52.230 --> 00:21:56.400
<v 0>trying to sort of regulate the way people communicate with each other.</v>

368
00:21:56.460 --> 00:22:00.660
So it's not, it's like if someone said that to someone in a bar,

369
00:22:00.750 --> 00:22:04.560
a cop would not arrest them. Like yeah, you listen to a little queer, you know,

370
00:22:04.770 --> 00:22:06.480
that would be like, Oh that guy's an asshole.

371
00:22:06.550 --> 00:22:09.760
<v 1>But the bar would be perfectly within their legal right to say we don't,</v>

372
00:22:09.790 --> 00:22:12.250
we don't want you in here. You're making our customers uncomfortable.

373
00:22:12.251 --> 00:22:15.430
And nobody would say that. It would be against the law for the bar to say,

374
00:22:15.620 --> 00:22:16.200
you got to go.

375
00:22:16.200 --> 00:22:18.640
<v 0>And that's a good point. If they were doing it to their face,</v>

376
00:22:18.880 --> 00:22:23.880
but what if he was in a corner talking about this guy that wasn't there and he

377
00:22:24.041 --> 00:22:24.890
was saying, yeah,

378
00:22:24.891 --> 00:22:28.000
so he's talking about Antifa this list be a little Mexican queer.

379
00:22:28.210 --> 00:22:30.970
If you came along and decided to kick the guy out of the bar, then

380
00:22:31.410 --> 00:22:33.360
<v 1>it would, I mean, listen at some bars,</v>

381
00:22:33.390 --> 00:22:36.900
if you go into the corner and you yell about a lispy and Mexican queer,

382
00:22:36.901 --> 00:22:40.110
they're going to ask you to leave and it still would not be illegal and the bar

383
00:22:40.111 --> 00:22:41.430
would still not be doing anything. Right.

384
00:22:41.500 --> 00:22:43.180
<v 0>But that's a bar, right?</v>

385
00:22:43.181 --> 00:22:45.990
That's a private business where people are physically there. Yes.

386
00:22:46.060 --> 00:22:48.580
Isn't there a difference between that and something like YouTube,

387
00:22:48.581 --> 00:22:51.040
which again falls more in line with like a town square?

388
00:22:51.110 --> 00:22:55.100
<v 1>Maybe that's what we need to revisit that because so much human communication is</v>

389
00:22:55.101 --> 00:22:58.970
now happening across these platforms. I would imagine most of it or most of it,

390
00:22:59.130 --> 00:22:59.270
we,

391
00:22:59.270 --> 00:23:04.270
we need to maybe stop drawing this arbitrary distinction that in person is a

392
00:23:05.241 --> 00:23:07.820
completely different thing than over the internet. I mean,

393
00:23:07.821 --> 00:23:10.790
maybe it's not increasingly, maybe it's more the same. Yeah.

394
00:23:11.480 --> 00:23:15.490
<v 0>Um, so I'm torn here, right?</v>

395
00:23:15.680 --> 00:23:16.960
On one side I say,

396
00:23:16.961 --> 00:23:21.961
well it seems like they still allow him to have his freedom of expression

397
00:23:23.860 --> 00:23:28.420
because he's still on YouTube. He still is able to upload his show on YouTube.

398
00:23:28.720 --> 00:23:30.550
He will have to find other ways to make money. Sure.

399
00:23:30.700 --> 00:23:32.320
So one part of me looks at it that way

400
00:23:32.550 --> 00:23:35.250
<v 1>and no one has a right to monetize on YouTube. Right, right,</v>

401
00:23:35.400 --> 00:23:37.080
<v 0>right. So in a sense,</v>

402
00:23:37.081 --> 00:23:40.800
they haven't violated his first amendment rights because he's still able to

403
00:23:40.801 --> 00:23:44.550
express himself. But then you go as a company,

404
00:23:44.700 --> 00:23:49.700
they've a punitive decision to eliminate his ability or his radically reduce his

405
00:23:50.751 --> 00:23:55.310
ability to make an income off of their platform. That seems like,

406
00:23:55.311 --> 00:23:56.750
and I'm not supporting that, they did it,

407
00:23:56.751 --> 00:24:01.730
but that seems more reasonable as a decision, right.

408
00:24:01.760 --> 00:24:05.600
To say we're going to demonetize you. That seems more reasonable.

409
00:24:06.500 --> 00:24:10.400
But the problem is there's no alternatives.

410
00:24:10.490 --> 00:24:14.660
There's nothing remotely like YouTube too over there is an alternative to

411
00:24:14.661 --> 00:24:18.770
YouTube for him to regain that same level of monetization. Yes.

412
00:24:18.920 --> 00:24:23.920
Or for people that share his viewpoint and share his ideology and share his

413
00:24:24.441 --> 00:24:28.470
positions. And there is no right-wing. YouTube is my point. And there's this,

414
00:24:28.700 --> 00:24:31.760
I would challenge the idea that YouTube has is left wing.

415
00:24:31.820 --> 00:24:35.990
I mean in terms of it's enforcing its policies. How so?

416
00:24:36.020 --> 00:24:38.990
I mean they have just this, just this particular issue, but this isn't,

417
00:24:39.020 --> 00:24:42.740
this isn't a a left wing. How is this a left wing enforcement?

418
00:24:42.770 --> 00:24:46.490
I mean they think it is because Carlos maze is progressive and because the

419
00:24:46.610 --> 00:24:49.670
argument that he was making his a very left wing progressive argument,

420
00:24:49.880 --> 00:24:51.650
and this is what Crowder was going after,

421
00:24:52.130 --> 00:24:55.760
he was going after the argument in the process of going after the argument,

422
00:24:55.761 --> 00:24:57.620
he mocked his sexuality and his appearance.

423
00:24:57.650 --> 00:25:02.090
I can assure you if it was focused merely on how much of a problem Antifa is,

424
00:25:02.540 --> 00:25:05.710
this would not have happened. I mean, I think we both, Oh yeah, for sure. Yeah.

425
00:25:06.620 --> 00:25:10.130
No, it's all about the mocking the guy's sexual orientation and looks.

426
00:25:10.131 --> 00:25:11.300
That's where Carlos Mazda,

427
00:25:11.420 --> 00:25:14.810
where a gay Republican and the exact same thing happened.

428
00:25:15.140 --> 00:25:17.690
Do you think the outcome would have been different? Yes. Why?

429
00:25:17.870 --> 00:25:21.170
I just don't think people be interested. Oh, well that's a dip boat. But,

430
00:25:21.171 --> 00:25:22.790
so that gets to the real crux of it,

431
00:25:22.820 --> 00:25:27.820
which is my real concern with this is YouTube only getting involved in even

432
00:25:29.151 --> 00:25:31.870
publicly saying what they're doing about a channel, right?

433
00:25:31.910 --> 00:25:36.140
When it becomes very public and it starts to have the possibility of impacting

434
00:25:36.141 --> 00:25:40.220
their bottom line and brand, saying, yes, this is too hot and we're getting out.

435
00:25:40.310 --> 00:25:41.330
Well, in that sense,

436
00:25:41.331 --> 00:25:46.160
what Carlos did once it was revealed that YouTube was not going to take action

437
00:25:46.580 --> 00:25:48.800
was very effective. Absolutely. I mean,

438
00:25:48.801 --> 00:25:52.190
he started tweeting like crazy and people jumped on board.

439
00:25:52.760 --> 00:25:57.110
He connected it to the LBGT movement and, and then it became this thing

440
00:26:04.940 --> 00:26:04.940
<v 2>[inaudible].</v>
