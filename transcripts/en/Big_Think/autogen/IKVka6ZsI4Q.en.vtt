is to realize that you know military

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:54.090
is to realize that you know military
 

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:59.179
is to realize that you know military
solutions to those problems are woefully

worth doing but it's it's hardly the
right answer in a lot of cases and it

00:02:09.109 --> 00:02:09.119
right answer in a lot of cases and it
 

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:11.170
right answer in a lot of cases and it
certainly is never the fundamental and

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:11.180
certainly is never the fundamental and
 

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:14.309
certainly is never the fundamental and
the fundamental answer always has to be

00:02:14.309 --> 00:02:14.319
the fundamental answer always has to be
 

00:02:14.319 --> 00:02:18.759
the fundamental answer always has to be
