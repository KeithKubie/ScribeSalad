00:00:00.960 --> 00:00:05.980
We're on problem 33 and it
asks, which equation

00:00:05.980 --> 00:00:10.760
represents a line that is
parallel to y is equal to

00:00:10.760 --> 00:00:15.490
minus 5/4 x plus 2?

00:00:15.490 --> 00:00:18.100
So a line that's parallel will
have the same slope.

00:00:18.100 --> 00:00:19.980
And we can just look at this, we
could inspect this and say,

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:23.780
OK, the slope of this line is
the coefficient on the x term.

00:00:23.780 --> 00:00:26.260
So slope on this line
is right there.

00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:31.580
Because the slope is
equal to minus 5/4.

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:33.400
And so we just have to look at
the other choices and say,

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:36.570
which one has the same
slope of minus 5/4?

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:40.850
And choice A actually is, choice
A is y is equal to

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:45.880
minus 5/4 x plus 1.

00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:47.720
So it has the exact same
slope and it's just

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:50.370
shifted down by 1.

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:51.795
So A is our choice.

00:00:51.795 --> 00:00:55.058
Now problem 34.

00:00:55.058 --> 00:00:56.990
Let me copy and paste
this one.

00:01:01.706 --> 00:01:04.150
Let's see, I can paste it.

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:11.410
All right, and they ask us,
which graph represents the

00:01:11.410 --> 00:01:15.420
solution to this system
of inequalities?

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:17.900
OK, so we could take each of
these inequalities and then,

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:21.300
what we want to do is we want
the area that satisfies both

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:22.110
of these inequalities.

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:24.390
So let's take a look
at the first one.

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:27.140
And I like to always have it
in kind of y is equal to mx

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:27.850
plus b form.

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:28.530
So let's do that.

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:32.530
So the first one says 2x
is greater than or

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:35.360
equal to y minus 1.

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:41.640
If we add 1 to both sides, we
get 2x plus 1 is greater than

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:42.970
or equal to y.

00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:44.920
And if we just want to write
that in a way that we're used

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:47.940
to seeing it, y-- I'm just
switching it around.

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:52.600
y is less than or equal
to 2x plus 1.

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:54.780
So let's see which one
this represents.

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:57.980
We have a line, 2x plus 1, so
the y-intercept is 1 and the

00:01:57.980 --> 00:02:00.170
slope is 2.

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:01.200
So let's see.

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:03.300
So that's this line here.

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:05.850
y-intercept 1 and if
we go over to the

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:11.240
right 2, we go up 4.

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:13.700
However much we increase
in x, we increase twice

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:14.550
as much with y.

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:16.400
That's what the slope
tells us.

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:21.430
And that's this line in
this chart like that.

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:21.920
Fair enough.

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:22.720
So that's that line.

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:24.460
And they're saying y
is less than that.

00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:27.930
So we want the area
below that graph.

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:29.140
So it's not this one.

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:32.500
This one they're shading in
the area above that line.

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:36.030
For any x and y that's on the
line, they're shading in y is

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:37.730
greater than that point.

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:41.410
No, but we what y is less
than that point.

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:44.220
For any y on the point,
all the y's less

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:45.680
than it satisfy it.

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:47.920
So based on the information now,
this one seems to be a

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:48.785
pretty good candidate.

00:02:48.785 --> 00:02:52.160
I haven't looked at the
other line yet.

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:55.950
And frankly, neither of--
I guess, no neither.

00:02:55.950 --> 00:02:58.060
Maybe this one might be a
candidate because this

00:02:58.060 --> 00:02:59.040
is also less than.

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:02.610
Maybe we have to be less than
both of these lines, right?

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:04.280
This is the line that
we just figured out.

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:05.410
We're definitely less than it.

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:08.210
Maybe we have to be less than
that second line as well.

00:03:08.210 --> 00:03:10.370
So if we have to be greater
than that second line, we

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:11.260
haven't looked at that yet.

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:13.220
It's going to be choice C.

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:16.280
If we have to be less than the
second line and this first

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:19.250
line, then we're going
to be in choice D.

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:22.320
Let's see what the second piece
of information tells us.

00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:25.040
OK, well they actually have a
typo and they don't give us

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:30.140
enough information
to actually-- let

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:32.140
me look up the answer.

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:34.510
Because they didn't even write
a greater than or equal or

00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:35.810
nothing here.

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:39.330
So I have to see what they
probably intended.

00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:41.730
OK, so I just looked up the
answer and they said that the

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:43.220
answer is C.

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:46.780
So they must want us to be
greater than this second line.

00:03:49.460 --> 00:03:53.880
So let's figure out what
this should have been.

00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:56.000
What should have this-- should
there have been an equals?

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:57.270
Well, definitely not
an equal sign.

00:03:57.270 --> 00:03:58.820
But should there have been
a greater than or

00:03:58.820 --> 00:03:59.800
less than or whatever?

00:03:59.800 --> 00:04:01.290
We'll figure that out.

00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:01.800
So let's see.

00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:08.270
2x minus 5y circle 10.

00:04:08.270 --> 00:04:09.930
We don't know if there's an
equal there or less-- this is

00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:12.545
almost a better exercise than
what they intended.

00:04:15.510 --> 00:04:15.890
Let's see.

00:04:15.890 --> 00:04:19.504
If we were to add 5y to both
sides, I just want to get y on

00:04:19.504 --> 00:04:20.040
the other side.

00:04:20.040 --> 00:04:21.959
And I don't want to have
to say flip signs and

00:04:21.959 --> 00:04:23.530
divide by minus 5.

00:04:23.530 --> 00:04:24.820
So let me get 5y on
the other side.

00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:26.140
So I'll add 5y to both sides.

00:04:26.140 --> 00:04:28.010
So we get 2x.

00:04:28.010 --> 00:04:31.420
Whatever inequality sign,
so that could

00:04:31.420 --> 00:04:33.330
be an equal or whatever.

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:37.570
10 plus 5y.

00:04:37.570 --> 00:04:39.190
Subtract 10 from both sides.

00:04:39.190 --> 00:04:44.180
So you get 2x minus
10 circle 5y.

00:04:44.180 --> 00:04:46.210
Remember that circle could
be an equal sign.

00:04:46.210 --> 00:04:46.840
Well, it's not an equal.

00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:48.330
It's either a greater than
or equal or it's a

00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:49.650
less than or equal.

00:04:49.650 --> 00:04:56.400
And then we can divide both
sides by 5 and you get 2

00:04:56.400 --> 00:05:03.370
divided by 5 x minus 2, some
greater than or equal or less

00:05:03.370 --> 00:05:06.060
than or equal sign, y.

00:05:06.060 --> 00:05:08.690
Now they told us C was the
answer because I had to look

00:05:08.690 --> 00:05:11.990
it up because they didn't give
us any inequality sign there.

00:05:11.990 --> 00:05:14.460
If C is the answer that means
we're going to-- we want all

00:05:14.460 --> 00:05:17.410
y's that are below
the first line.

00:05:17.410 --> 00:05:20.330
So below this line right here.

00:05:20.330 --> 00:05:22.850
So that's that area.

00:05:22.850 --> 00:05:26.600
And if we're in this grey area,
all y's that are above

00:05:26.600 --> 00:05:30.040
this bottom line.

00:05:30.040 --> 00:05:32.400
So if we're above this bottom
line, this bottom line

00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:34.560
is 2/5 x minus 2.

00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:36.920
So we want all y's that
are greater than that.

00:05:40.180 --> 00:05:45.110
Sorry, I've done it-- we want
all the y's that are greater

00:05:45.110 --> 00:05:47.940
than that. y is greater
than this thing.

00:05:47.940 --> 00:05:50.810
So that sign in this
problem should have

00:05:50.810 --> 00:05:54.110
been a less than sign.

00:05:54.110 --> 00:05:56.570
I'm saying y is greater
than this.

00:05:56.570 --> 00:05:59.640
But if you read it left to
right, you have 2x minus 2 is

00:05:59.640 --> 00:06:01.090
less than y.

00:06:01.090 --> 00:06:02.400
And so we figured
out the sign.

00:06:02.400 --> 00:06:03.280
And you might be saying,
hey, wait.

00:06:03.280 --> 00:06:06.790
How come this area over
here doesn't work?

00:06:06.790 --> 00:06:08.650
Well if you think about
it, this area is

00:06:08.650 --> 00:06:11.080
above our first line.

00:06:11.080 --> 00:06:13.880
This area is y is greater
than 2x plus 1.

00:06:13.880 --> 00:06:15.670
It's above our first line.

00:06:15.670 --> 00:06:17.970
And it's actually below
our second line.

00:06:17.970 --> 00:06:19.530
So it's actually the
opposite area.

00:06:19.530 --> 00:06:21.420
Anyway, next problem.

00:06:21.420 --> 00:06:24.780
The answer was C.

00:06:24.780 --> 00:06:30.200
Next problem, 35.

00:06:30.200 --> 00:06:31.160
OK, let's see.

00:06:31.160 --> 00:06:32.510
I'll copy and paste this one.

00:06:32.510 --> 00:06:33.800
I think the choices
are interesting.

00:06:41.300 --> 00:06:44.340
What is the solution to this
system of equations?

00:06:44.340 --> 00:06:48.170
All right, so let's see if we
can get in a form that makes

00:06:48.170 --> 00:06:51.330
it easy to look at.

00:06:51.330 --> 00:06:52.770
Let's take that first
equation and let's

00:06:52.770 --> 00:06:54.640
add 3x to both sides.

00:06:54.640 --> 00:06:57.530
If you add 3x to both sides,
that first equation becomes

00:06:57.530 --> 00:07:03.990
positive 3x plus y is
equal to minus 2.

00:07:03.990 --> 00:07:06.440
All I did is I did plus 3--
you can't see that.

00:07:06.440 --> 00:07:11.080
I added plus 3x to both sides
of this equation.

00:07:11.080 --> 00:07:13.380
And of course, that
cancels with that.

00:07:13.380 --> 00:07:14.920
All right, and now let' see.

00:07:14.920 --> 00:07:20.740
That second equation is 6x plus
2 is equal to minus 2.

00:07:20.740 --> 00:07:22.810
Well let me do something else
to this equation and I think

00:07:22.810 --> 00:07:23.890
it'll become apparent
that these are

00:07:23.890 --> 00:07:25.650
actually the same line.

00:07:25.650 --> 00:07:28.510
So if you take this first
equation and multiply both

00:07:28.510 --> 00:07:30.460
sides of it by 2,
what do you get?

00:07:30.460 --> 00:07:31.160
Let's see.

00:07:31.160 --> 00:07:36.620
Multiply 3x plus y by 2, you
get 2 times 3x is 6x.

00:07:36.620 --> 00:07:37.990
Plus 2 times y.

00:07:37.990 --> 00:07:39.670
You have to distribute the 2.

00:07:39.670 --> 00:07:41.500
Plus 2y is equal to.

00:07:41.500 --> 00:07:45.650
Minus 2 times to 2 is minus 4.

00:07:45.650 --> 00:07:46.900
And they're the same line.

00:07:50.770 --> 00:07:54.370
So when you're solving a system
of equations, you're

00:07:54.370 --> 00:07:57.990
figuring out, where do those
two equations intersect?

00:07:57.990 --> 00:08:01.640
If they're the same lines, they
intersect everywhere.

00:08:01.640 --> 00:08:04.480
So they have an infinite
number of solutions.

00:08:04.480 --> 00:08:07.075
So the answer is choice D.

00:08:10.510 --> 00:08:11.760
Next problem.

00:08:14.650 --> 00:08:17.840
They give us another
one like that.

00:08:17.840 --> 00:08:20.180
They want to know the ordered
pair that's a

00:08:20.180 --> 00:08:22.040
solution to this equation.

00:08:22.040 --> 00:08:25.450
I'll just copy and paste
the equation there.

00:08:25.450 --> 00:08:28.830
OK, so the easiest thing to do
is probably to just subtract

00:08:28.830 --> 00:08:31.770
the second equation from
the first equation.

00:08:31.770 --> 00:08:33.690
And instead, I'll actually
write it out explicitly.

00:08:33.690 --> 00:08:39.110
So the first question is x
plus 3y is equal to 7.

00:08:39.110 --> 00:08:41.240
Instead of subtracting this one
from that one, let's just

00:08:41.240 --> 00:08:43.540
multiply the second question by
negative 1 and then we'll

00:08:43.540 --> 00:08:44.750
add the two equations.

00:08:44.750 --> 00:08:47.610
So if we multiply this bottom
equation by negative 1 we get

00:08:47.610 --> 00:08:52.660
minus x minus 2y is
equal to minus 10.

00:08:52.660 --> 00:08:54.310
And the whole reason why I'm
doing that is I know when I

00:08:54.310 --> 00:08:57.680
add these two left-hand sides,
the x and the minus x are

00:08:57.680 --> 00:08:58.570
going to cancel out.

00:08:58.570 --> 00:09:00.150
And then I can just
solve for y.

00:09:00.150 --> 00:09:02.510
That's why you immediately see,
they have an x and an x.

00:09:02.510 --> 00:09:07.610
If we subtract this from that,
they'll cancel out.

00:09:07.610 --> 00:09:10.850
So if we add these two
equations, the x' cancel out.

00:09:10.850 --> 00:09:14.510
3y minus 2y is equal to y.

00:09:14.510 --> 00:09:22.140
And 7 minus 10 is equal
to minus 3.

00:09:25.090 --> 00:09:25.560
Fair enough.

00:09:25.560 --> 00:09:27.500
And now we can substitute back
in to figure out an x.

00:09:27.500 --> 00:09:30.896
So let's use the
first equation.

00:09:30.896 --> 00:09:36.130
x plus 3 times minus 3-- we
figured out what y is-- is

00:09:36.130 --> 00:09:39.250
equal to 7.

00:09:39.250 --> 00:09:41.200
And then you get x.

00:09:41.200 --> 00:09:44.486
3 times-- minus 9
is equal to 7.

00:09:44.486 --> 00:09:47.620
x is equal to-- add 9 to both
sides of this equation.

00:09:47.620 --> 00:09:49.580
x is equal to 16.

00:09:49.580 --> 00:09:54.070
So the solution is 16 comma
minus 3. x and y.

00:09:54.070 --> 00:09:55.520
And that is choice D.

00:09:58.690 --> 00:10:08.860
All right, problem 37.

00:10:08.860 --> 00:10:11.850
Marcy has a total of 100
dimes and quarters.

00:10:11.850 --> 00:10:14.190
If the total value of the coins
is $14.05, how many

00:10:14.190 --> 00:10:15.780
quarters does she have?

00:10:15.780 --> 00:10:19.555
All right, so let's say that d
is a number of dimes and q is

00:10:19.555 --> 00:10:21.000
the number of quarters.

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:24.290
So if you take the number of
dimes plus the number of

00:10:24.290 --> 00:10:28.900
quarters she has 100 coins.

00:10:28.900 --> 00:10:32.020
That's this piece of information
right there.

00:10:32.020 --> 00:10:35.510
And then the total value
of the coins.

00:10:35.510 --> 00:10:41.180
It's going to be 0.10 times the
number of dimes plus 0.25

00:10:41.180 --> 00:10:43.110
times the number of quarters.

00:10:43.110 --> 00:10:51.160
And they tell us that that
is equal to $14.05.

00:10:51.160 --> 00:10:52.410
And that's this piece
of information.

00:10:52.410 --> 00:10:54.760
The total value of the
coins is $14.05.

00:10:54.760 --> 00:10:56.960
And they say, well, how many
quarters does she have?

00:10:56.960 --> 00:10:59.640
So we just have to
solve for q.

00:10:59.640 --> 00:11:01.370
So let's do that.

00:11:01.370 --> 00:11:04.270
So if we want to cancel out the
d's, what we could do is

00:11:04.270 --> 00:11:06.640
we can multiply this
top equation by

00:11:06.640 --> 00:11:09.650
let's say, minus 0.1.

00:11:09.650 --> 00:11:11.510
And I'm doing that so
it cancels out with

00:11:11.510 --> 00:11:13.050
this d right here.

00:11:13.050 --> 00:11:14.850
Let me do it in a
different color.

00:11:14.850 --> 00:11:20.820
So if I multiply that top
equation times minus 0.1 I get

00:11:20.820 --> 00:11:27.500
minus 0.1d-- I could write
1-0 if I want-- d.

00:11:27.500 --> 00:11:35.030
Minus 0.10q is equal to-- what's
minus 1/10 of 100?

00:11:35.030 --> 00:11:38.650
Well that's minus 10, right?

00:11:38.650 --> 00:11:42.090
100 times 0.1 is 10 and we're
doing a minus 0.1.

00:11:42.090 --> 00:11:43.930
All right, now we can add
these two equations.

00:11:46.810 --> 00:11:50.210
0.1d minus 0.1d, those
cancel out.

00:11:50.210 --> 00:11:55.510
0.25q minus 0.1q, that's equal
to-- let me switch colors.

00:11:55.510 --> 00:12:01.030
That's equal to 0.15q
is equal to-- and

00:12:01.030 --> 00:12:03.550
what's 14.05 minus 10?

00:12:03.550 --> 00:12:07.230
That's equal to $4.05.

00:12:07.230 --> 00:12:09.220
Just to get rid of the decimals,
we can multiply both

00:12:09.220 --> 00:12:12.860
sides of this equation by 100.

00:12:12.860 --> 00:12:20.160
So we'll get 15q is
equal to 405.

00:12:20.160 --> 00:12:20.600
So q.

00:12:20.600 --> 00:12:22.760
We divide both sides
of this by 15.

00:12:22.760 --> 00:12:27.480
And so how many times
does 15 go into 405?

00:12:27.480 --> 00:12:28.870
15 goes into 40, what?

00:12:28.870 --> 00:12:29.570
Two times.

00:12:29.570 --> 00:12:34.940
2 times 15 is 30.

00:12:34.940 --> 00:12:36.080
Get a 10.

00:12:36.080 --> 00:12:37.310
105.

00:12:37.310 --> 00:12:41.470
15 goes into 105 seven
times I think.

00:12:41.470 --> 00:12:44.540
7 times 5 is 35.

00:12:44.540 --> 00:12:45.750
7 times 1 is 7.

00:12:45.750 --> 00:12:46.990
Plus 3 is 10.

00:12:46.990 --> 00:12:47.670
27.

00:12:47.670 --> 00:12:50.100
So q is equal to 27.

00:12:50.100 --> 00:12:53.570
So Marcy has 27 quarters.

00:12:53.570 --> 00:12:56.030
Anyway, see you in
the next video.
