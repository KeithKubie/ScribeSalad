00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:11.060
Hey Nico, you wanted to see me?

00:00:11.060 --> 00:00:13.000
Hey Anna.  Come in, have a seat.

00:00:15.640 --> 00:00:17.880
Anna you do great great work here.

00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:22.700
But we're in the difficult position of having to cut back this year.

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:26.280
And unfortunately there's no longer a spot for you at Corridor Digital.

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:27.480
Oh.

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:28.480
Yeah.

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:30.660
I'm sorry.  This kind of thing is never easy.

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:32.560
Am I still invited to the company picnic?

00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:33.140
What?

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:34.200
The company picnic.

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:36.380
Can I still come and hang out with everyone?

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:36.980
Uh.

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:39.240
The company picnic is for employees only.

00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:42.620
I was really looking forward to going to the company picnic.

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:44.980
I know it's going to be disappointing to miss out.

00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:48.020
I'm sorry.  Let's talk your severance though, okay?

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:50.080
Sure.  Sure.  Uh, what am I looking at?

00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:51.900
Well, we're prepared to offer you 6 weeks pay

00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:54.400
plus compensation for your unused vacation and sick days

00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:57.040
and we're going to extend your healthcare and dental by 3 months.

00:00:57.040 --> 00:01:01.880
That's great. Uhm, I'd also like commission on anything that I close this quarter.

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:03.480
Yeah, that's totally fine.

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:05.880
And half an hour at the company picnic.

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:07.380
The company picnic is off the table.

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:11.740
Forget the commission.  I want 15 minutes at the company picnic.

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:13.180
Anna, it's not happening.

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:15.360
Playing hard ball.  All right.

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:20.120
Cancel my health insurance and I will stand at the perimeter of the picnic while someone

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:21.600
brings me a plate of food.

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:23.960
I will give you 8 weeks pay to drop the subject right now.

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:26.020
I've worked at other places before.

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:30.640
Nobody does a company picnic like Corridor Digital does a company picnic.

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:31.980
Yeah, you think I don't know that?

00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:35.220
I've had this conversation every time I've had to lay somebody off.

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:38.940
Branden gave me his new Tesla just for one of Ivy's Lemon Bars.

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:43.920
Just tell me where the picnic is, and I will kill anyone you ask.

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:46.160
Anna, I don't want to pity you.

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:48.320
Tell me where the company picnic is!

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:50.900
Is it at Griffith Park?  Pan Pacific?

00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:53.260
Echo Park Lake?  You son of a bitch.

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:57.740
I swear to you, until the day you die, you will never find out where this picnic is!

00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:00.400
Security!

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:04.780
Ms. Akana was just leaving.  Make sure she gets her stuff from her desk.

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:05.660
Little monster!

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:07.820
Get off of me you freak of nature!

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:11.540
Oh, Anna!  I will tell you one more thing.

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:12.640
3 words.

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:13.840
Adult Bouncy Castle.

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:17.880
You bastard.  You God damn bastard!

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:21.800
I hope you get ants Nico!  I hope you get ants!

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.380
Really quick, can I still get a referral?

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:26.520
Yeah, not a problem.

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:27.460
Thanks so much.

00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:29.560
It was nice working with you!
