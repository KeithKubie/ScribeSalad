ANTHONY MAYS: Welcome to
"Engineering Everyday Equity."

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:05.190
I'm Anthony B. Mays,
software engineer

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:08.620
on the data visualization
team here at Google.

00:00:08.620 --> 00:00:10.500
In this series,
we're going to talk

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:14.200
about practical ways in which
we can build Equity, Diversity,

00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:18.990
and Inclusion, or EDI, into the
product development process.

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:22.620
And for this episode, the
third of our three-part series,

00:00:22.620 --> 00:00:25.080
we're going to specifically
focus on the validation

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:26.850
and prototyping phase.

00:00:26.850 --> 00:00:29.550
So now I'd like to
welcome Rafael Vasquez

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:32.880
as we talk about the validation
phase of the design sprint

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:33.750
process.

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:34.350
Welcome, Raf.

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:34.850
RAFAEL VASQUEZ: Yeah, thanks.

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:36.289
You know, it's good to be here.

00:00:36.289 --> 00:00:37.830
I'm a program manager
here at Google,

00:00:37.830 --> 00:00:40.140
and I've seen firsthand
what can happen

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:43.470
when you don't take into account
getting a diverse set of users

00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:45.540
to use your product early on.

00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:48.960
What ends up happening is that
you end up getting tech debt.

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:51.660
And what you and I might
think about tech debt

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:54.150
is pieces of code,
or things that

00:00:54.150 --> 00:00:55.280
don't work as they should--

00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:55.530
ANTHONY MAYS: Right.

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:56.480
RAFAEL VASQUEZ: --or
bugs, and we're just going

00:00:56.480 --> 00:00:57.490
to fix it later type stuff.

00:00:57.490 --> 00:00:57.650
ANTHONY MAYS: Right.

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:58.566
RAFAEL VASQUEZ: Right?

00:00:58.566 --> 00:01:00.930
But tech debt is
more than just that.

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:05.489
Tech debt can mean things
like having your app not be

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:07.500
really usable for
certain communities

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:09.420
because of what they're in.

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:12.480
So as an example, I
am a program manager

00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:14.580
that's part of the
people in sharing team,

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:18.300
and we worked on the photos
direct sharing feature.

00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:20.580
But I'm also-- I was
also born in El Salvador,

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:23.449
and I came here, and a lot
of my family is still there.

00:01:23.449 --> 00:01:25.990
And when we launched this, I
was really excited to show them.

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:27.448
Hey, this is
something I worked on.

00:01:27.448 --> 00:01:28.410
This is so cool.

00:01:28.410 --> 00:01:31.170
And what ended up
happening was that it

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:33.210
didn't work that well for them.

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:36.840
And what I noticed was that they
don't have the newest phones.

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:40.770
They don't have the best
data coverage, data plans.

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:44.310
And those things really hampered
how the usage of that feature

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:45.270
work.

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:47.220
And if we had started
to address those things

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:49.800
early on as part of our
testing and as part of our--

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:51.950
we could have we could
have fixed the app up.

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:53.741
ANTHONY MAYS: Yeah, I
can really appreciate

00:01:53.741 --> 00:01:55.560
that, because as an
engineer, after putting

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:59.430
all of the hours and time
into building this application

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:03.012
and building what I
believe is a great product,

00:02:03.012 --> 00:02:04.470
you end up in a
situation where you

00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:07.350
can't get it out to people as
quickly as you may have wanted.

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:09.630
And so you've got
a delayed timeline,

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:11.130
you've got things
you've got to fix,

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:15.000
and those changes are probably
more expensive on the tail end

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:16.980
than they would have been
had we addressed them

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:18.300
sooner in the process, right?

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:19.175
RAFAEL VASQUEZ: Yeah.

00:02:19.175 --> 00:02:22.410
So actually, I was on a team
that had one of our releases

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:24.844
be put in jeopardy
because we did not address

00:02:24.844 --> 00:02:26.010
screen readers early enough.

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:27.270
And so we had to do a
last-minute scramble

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:28.600
to try to get it out on time.

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:29.975
And if we had just
taken the time

00:02:29.975 --> 00:02:33.600
to do that during the
prototype and validation phase

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:36.420
and we had made sure
that we had had someone

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:39.524
who would use a screen
reader as part of that group,

00:02:39.524 --> 00:02:41.190
we wouldn't have been
in that situation.

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:41.850
ANTHONY MAYS: Wow, yeah.

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:43.641
So I can imagine that's
really frustrating.

00:02:43.641 --> 00:02:46.440
And I also have to imagine
that those things are much more

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:49.240
expensive to fix later in the
process rather than sooner.

00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:49.810
RAFAEL VASQUEZ: They are.

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:52.140
And that's why you want to take
that time upfront to recruit

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:54.515
a diverse set of users when
you're prototyping and making

00:02:54.515 --> 00:02:57.150
sure that those users actually
use all the different use

00:02:57.150 --> 00:02:59.430
cases in your app
and in the ways

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:01.020
that they would normally do it.

00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:02.730
So what's this app
that you're building?

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:04.480
ANTHONY MAYS: So this
app is called Scholar.

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:06.605
And it's about connecting
matriculating high school

00:03:06.605 --> 00:03:10.230
students with colleges and
scholarship opportunities.

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:12.930
And it's really designed to
remove the frustration out

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:16.090
of the process of pursuing
a college education.

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:19.250
RAFAEL VASQUEZ: So you can
take that app, and you can--

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:22.230
when you prototype that app,
you can take the easy route

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:24.470
and just see can students
find the scholarships.

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:25.470
ANTHONY MAYS: OK, right.

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:27.210
RAFAEL VASQUEZ: But you want to
start looking at other things,

00:03:27.210 --> 00:03:27.810
too.

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:29.970
You want to start
looking at making sure

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:32.247
that students of
different ethnicities

00:03:32.247 --> 00:03:34.080
or different abilities
can find scholarships

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:35.160
that are geared towards them.

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:37.034
Because there are some
scholarships out there

00:03:37.034 --> 00:03:39.314
that are geared towards
specific types of students.

00:03:39.314 --> 00:03:41.730
And then if you're going to
take this app internationally,

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:46.170
you are also looking at other
things, too, like, let's say,

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:48.474
language and dialect.

00:03:48.474 --> 00:03:49.890
There is countries
out there where

00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:50.790
there are multiple dialects.

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:52.830
Can people of multiple
dialects use your app

00:03:52.830 --> 00:03:54.480
and find information easily?

00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:56.700
So all those things you
can take into account

00:03:56.700 --> 00:03:58.320
when you prototype
by making sure

00:03:58.320 --> 00:04:02.132
that you have a wide variety of
users that go through your app.

00:04:02.132 --> 00:04:02.840
ANTHONY MAYS: OK.

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:05.190
And I care about all of those
different kinds of users.

00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:08.310
All right, Raf, so how
do I find these users

00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:09.440
from diverse backgrounds?

00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:11.520
And when should I
start looking for them?

00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:13.470
RAFAEL VASQUEZ: Well, you should
really start looking for them

00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:15.990
even before you start your
design sprint because you don't

00:04:15.990 --> 00:04:18.240
want to end up in a situation
where you built a prototype,

00:04:18.240 --> 00:04:19.948
and you need people
to use it, and you're

00:04:19.948 --> 00:04:21.412
scrambling to find people.

00:04:21.412 --> 00:04:22.620
That's one of the key things.

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:23.400
ANTHONY MAYS: Because
then it starts

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:24.990
to feel like more
of an afterthought.

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:25.410
RAFAEL VASQUEZ: Exactly.

00:04:25.410 --> 00:04:26.118
ANTHONY MAYS: OK.

00:04:26.118 --> 00:04:29.490
All right, so do I use social
media to find these users?

00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:30.270
Or--

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:31.980
RAFAEL VASQUEZ: Yeah, I mean,
social media is a good way.

00:04:31.980 --> 00:04:34.105
You can figure out which
social media platforms are

00:04:34.105 --> 00:04:36.730
popular with the users that
you want to target and post ads

00:04:36.730 --> 00:04:37.230
there.

00:04:37.230 --> 00:04:38.680
That's a good way of doing it.

00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:41.610
Another way is you
could reach out

00:04:41.610 --> 00:04:44.160
to nonprofits that are
working with the groups

00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:47.070
that you are trying to
get feedback from and ask

00:04:47.070 --> 00:04:47.695
for help there.

00:04:47.695 --> 00:04:48.986
ANTHONY MAYS: That makes sense.

00:04:48.986 --> 00:04:51.461
All right, and maybe I can go
tap some friends and family

00:04:51.461 --> 00:04:52.710
on the shoulder, I don't know.

00:04:52.710 --> 00:04:54.660
RAFAEL VASQUEZ: Well, you
should really start looking for

00:04:54.660 --> 00:04:57.210
even before you start your
design sprint because you don't

00:04:57.210 --> 00:04:59.430
want to end up in a situation
where you've built a prototype

00:04:59.430 --> 00:05:01.100
and you need people
to use it and you're

00:05:01.100 --> 00:05:02.330
scrambling to find people.

00:05:02.330 --> 00:05:04.010
Figure out which
social media platforms

00:05:04.010 --> 00:05:06.751
are popular with the users that
you want to target and post ads

00:05:06.751 --> 00:05:07.250
there.

00:05:07.250 --> 00:05:08.730
That's a good way of doing it.

00:05:08.730 --> 00:05:11.660
Another way is you
could reach out

00:05:11.660 --> 00:05:14.180
to nonprofits that are
working with the groups

00:05:14.180 --> 00:05:17.491
that you're trying to get
feedback from and ask for help

00:05:17.491 --> 00:05:17.990
that.

00:05:17.990 --> 00:05:19.160
You also have to
remember that you

00:05:19.160 --> 00:05:21.650
want to try to get your product
out as close to the user

00:05:21.650 --> 00:05:22.400
as possible.

00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:24.740
So you want to think
about remote testing,

00:05:24.740 --> 00:05:25.670
like how do you get--

00:05:25.670 --> 00:05:26.450
ANTHONY MAYS: Remote testing?

00:05:26.450 --> 00:05:27.395
What's that all about?

00:05:27.395 --> 00:05:29.270
RAFAEL VASQUEZ: You
could bring your user in,

00:05:29.270 --> 00:05:32.750
and you could have the user
use the product in your office,

00:05:32.750 --> 00:05:33.260
per se.

00:05:33.260 --> 00:05:33.770
ANTHONY MAYS: Sure.

00:05:33.770 --> 00:05:35.600
RAFAEL VASQUEZ: And you'll
have a certain experience.

00:05:35.600 --> 00:05:37.516
But that experience could
be totally different

00:05:37.516 --> 00:05:40.700
when the user goes and uses
that product in their home,

00:05:40.700 --> 00:05:42.510
in their daily life.

00:05:42.510 --> 00:05:45.000
Their whole usage could
be completely different.

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:47.450
So you want to get as close
to the user as possible

00:05:47.450 --> 00:05:48.920
and get their feedback
when they're using it.

00:05:48.920 --> 00:05:51.253
ANTHONY MAYS: That's interesting
because that reminds me

00:05:51.253 --> 00:05:54.950
of something that Bryan
Stevenson, a social justice

00:05:54.950 --> 00:05:57.700
attorney and advocate,
once mentioned.

00:05:57.700 --> 00:06:02.250
He talked about being
proximate to communities

00:06:02.250 --> 00:06:05.060
that have these folks
from diverse backgrounds.

00:06:05.060 --> 00:06:06.980
And I remember him
talking about the need

00:06:06.980 --> 00:06:08.685
to really get close
to those communities

00:06:08.685 --> 00:06:10.310
and meeting their
needs where they are.

00:06:10.310 --> 00:06:12.470
And I feel like
remote testing can

00:06:12.470 --> 00:06:14.900
be part of that process
of being proximate

00:06:14.900 --> 00:06:15.980
with those communities.

00:06:15.980 --> 00:06:16.520
RAFAEL VASQUEZ: Exactly.

00:06:16.520 --> 00:06:18.269
And being proximate
with those communities

00:06:18.269 --> 00:06:21.050
is going to just open it up to
just seeing how your app works,

00:06:21.050 --> 00:06:23.360
and it'll save you a lot
of time in the future.

00:06:23.360 --> 00:06:24.750
ANTHONY MAYS: All right,
so remote testing.

00:06:24.750 --> 00:06:26.249
Yeah, that sounds
like a great idea.

00:06:26.249 --> 00:06:28.370
I can't wait to get Scholar
in front of my users

00:06:28.370 --> 00:06:30.140
and really meeting
them where they are.

00:06:30.140 --> 00:06:32.010
Raf, I really appreciate
having you here.

00:06:32.010 --> 00:06:32.570
Thanks for coming by.

00:06:32.570 --> 00:06:33.860
RAFAEL VASQUEZ:
Thank you, thank you.

00:06:33.860 --> 00:06:35.610
ANTHONY MAYS: And thank
you for joining us

00:06:35.610 --> 00:06:37.790
for this episode of
"Engineering Everyday Equity."

00:06:37.790 --> 00:06:39.830
If you'd like to learn
more, or if you'd

00:06:39.830 --> 00:06:41.940
like to further the work
of equity, diversity,

00:06:41.940 --> 00:06:44.010
and inclusion in your
company or product,

00:06:44.010 --> 00:06:46.200
please visit the link in
the description below.

00:06:46.200 --> 00:06:47.741
Also, if you have
any questions, feel

00:06:47.741 --> 00:06:49.650
free to drop those
in the comments.

00:06:49.650 --> 00:06:50.600
Thanks for watching.

00:06:50.600 --> 00:06:54.710
And remember, if you do
not intentionally include,

00:06:54.710 --> 00:06:57.590
you will
unintentionally exclude.

00:06:57.590 --> 00:06:58.790
Thanks.

00:06:58.790 --> 00:07:03.340
