This episode of "Shots of Awe"
is brought to you by Norton.

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:21.470
So I'm very passionate
about technology.

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:22.970
And most people
think of technology

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:26.790
as a set of tools that expand
our creative capacity somewhat.

00:00:26.790 --> 00:00:30.280
A set of tools that provide
useful services in the world.

00:00:30.280 --> 00:00:32.740
But I believe that there's a
hidden dimension at play here.

00:00:32.740 --> 00:00:35.156
I believe that there's this
hidden dimension to technology

00:00:35.156 --> 00:00:38.840
that's actually metaphysical,
that was explored brilliantly

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:42.030
in the work of Erik Davis
in the book "Techgnosis."

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:45.234
Consider the example of Amber
Case, cyborg anthropologist.

00:00:45.234 --> 00:00:47.150
She says every time you
make a telephone call,

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:50.075
a Skype call, you're essentially
collapsing geography,

00:00:50.075 --> 00:00:54.460
you're essentially transcending
the limits of space, of time,

00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:55.600
of distance.

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:58.210
Your thoughts electrified,
traveling at quasi

00:00:58.210 --> 00:00:59.860
the speed of light,
connecting you

00:00:59.860 --> 00:01:03.120
with another mind in real time
in a kind of technologically

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:06.950
mediated telepathy, to use
the term by David Porush.

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:10.340
And so these telephone calls,
these techno social wormholes,

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:13.630
reveal themselves to be a
kind of design engineering.

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:16.520
We become the alchemical gods.

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:19.710
Andy Clark, in his book
"Natural Born Cyborg"

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:23.000
says that the mind,
the modern human mind,

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:27.540
actually emerges in the
feedback loops between brains--

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:30.720
these tools that we create and
the environment in which we

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:31.680
create them.

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:36.250
We're thinking through our
iPhones and Samsung phones.

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:38.500
We're thinking on the internet.

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:41.010
We're thinking on the page.

00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:43.740
We build the tool, and
the tool builds us.

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:46.730
We are designed by that
which we have designed.

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:48.495
And because we are
coupled to these tools,

00:01:48.495 --> 00:01:52.310
and because these tools promise
to be conduits to transcending

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:54.250
our biological
limitations, perhaps we

00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:55.990
should be sympathetic
to the reason

00:01:55.990 --> 00:01:58.790
that we run in droves to
buy the new smartphone when

00:01:58.790 --> 00:01:59.956
it comes out.

00:01:59.956 --> 00:02:02.350
We're literally
getting a mind upgrade.

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:04.350
A wet-ware upgrade.

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:05.920
These are not
trivial things, these

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:07.210
are not fashion accessories.

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:10.240
These are mind-ware upgrades.
