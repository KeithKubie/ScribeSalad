00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:04.400
An IDS can be deployed to
monitor a network or subnet.

00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:07.770
It monitors traffic in real or
close to real time so

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:11.320
that it can react to
intrusions in a timely manner.

00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:15.390
It can analyze traffic in multiple
layers of the network stack.

00:00:15.390 --> 00:00:18.890
A network IDS can include
a number of sensors.

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:23.130
For example, each of them is
deployed to monitor a subnet.

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:28.280
In such case, it may include one or
more serves in the backend that manages

00:00:28.280 --> 00:00:32.310
these censors and
interface with a human analyst.

00:00:32.310 --> 00:00:36.150
Typically, a censor monitors
traffic of a subnet and

00:00:36.150 --> 00:00:39.110
reports its finding to
the backend server.

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:43.220
Then, the backend management server
can correlate evidence across

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:47.850
multiple sensors to provide protection
or detection of the whole network.
