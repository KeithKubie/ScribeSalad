00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.740
Hey what's going on guys we are back in this video

00:00:02.740 --> 00:00:04.740
we are experimenting with bottled oxygen and a can of pringles

00:00:04.760 --> 00:00:06.800
now before we jump into this crazy mad science

00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:10.420
i've noticed a lot of comments about how dirty my lab jacket has become

00:00:10.420 --> 00:00:15.180
and in my opinion a dirty lab jacket is just a token of how much knowledge and experience we've been able to gain

00:00:15.180 --> 00:00:17.640
but to answer your requests; lets go ahead and get that changed

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:18.140
*claps*

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:20.220
and they we have it! problem solved! lets dive right in.

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:26.380
now you probably remember a few videos ago we took a propane bottle, snipped the tip, and turned it upside down to extract liquid propane.

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:29.680
do you think the same method will work with a bottle of oxygen?

00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:31.680
could we extract liquid oxygen?

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:36.600
so quick update guys i've got my modified nozzle off the propane torch, but when we try adding it to the oxygen..

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:41.600
..the threads dont match which means we can't screw it on and we can't use it to extract the oxygen

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:43.420
so we are going to have to try something a little bit different

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:46.300
and if you look down the mouth of the bottle you can see there's a little button in there

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:50.100
and if you use something small enough and press that button down, you get the oxygen to release

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:50.640
*oxygen makes spurt noise*

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:54.620
the other thing that i notice is; as we shake the bottle around I cant hear any liquid sloshing around

00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:56.620
which doesnt give me much confidence there's much in this bottle at all

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:01.260
and if we look at the side of the bottle you can see its only 1.4 ounces,, which really isn't alot

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:06.080
so why than are these bottles of oxygen 11 dollars! 11 dollars for an ounce and a half!

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:06.820
cmon guys

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:11.159
flip these things over and see what we
can get out

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:15.270
all right our wrenches set in position
our bottles upside down theoretically we

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:18.869
release the gas and if it cools down
enough we should get liquid oxygen here

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:21.049
we go

00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:38.700
oh my gosh there we go ten seconds my
pliers are barely even frosted my allen

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:42.120
wrench has a little bit of frost on it
but there was absolutely no liquid so

00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:44.820
this thing is completely empty now I can
press that button and it's completely

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:49.080
depressurize there's no more oxygen ten
seconds and nothing's satisfying about

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:52.650
that that was $11 completely vaporized
so for our next experiment what would

00:01:52.650 --> 00:01:55.920
happen if we soaked one of these bottles
in liquid nitrogen first if we were to

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:59.040
bring the temperature down so cold and
bring the oxygen that's already in there

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:02.820
down to a liquid perhaps then we could
get it to drip out see if it works

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:06.180
alright it's time to chill it up let's
get this canister completely submerged

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:09.390
here we go I'm just going to do this
nice and slowly because they don't want

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:17.970
that nitrogen to boil out the top look
at the way it jumps it's jumping like a

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:22.680
good two inches high there from all the
heat that is extracting I'm listening

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:25.440
the container and I can hear things
contracting in there I can hear it

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:30.870
cooling down I love these little drops
of nitrogen this spit out a little smoke

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:34.280
trails we're getting the boil that's a
good sign

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:38.270
the storm before the calm

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:46.910
and we just hit the bottom as far down
as I can go right there the boiling

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:51.590
nitrogen makes really cool noise I just
love the way this down alright so we are

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:56.330
completely submerged we're just going to
chill here for about 30-40 second and

00:02:56.330 --> 00:03:00.050
right there you can see the nitrogen is
gone relatively calm which means most of

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:04.010
the heats been extracted so go ahead and
make your predictions below now that our

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:07.580
oxygen is cooled down to the temperature
of liquid nitrogen if I turn it upside

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:11.930
down and press the button will we in
fact extract liquid oxygen check this

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:15.590
out the canisters changed color it used
to be like a really bright red and now

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:19.130
it's more like an orange that's kind of
interesting it's pretty stark contrast

00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:22.460
in the color there all right moment of
truth I'm not really sure how to do this

00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:25.130
I've just got a death grip with my
pliers around the neck here I'm going to

00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:28.130
pull it out use the allen wrench to get
up there and press the button and we'll

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:32.960
see if we can get any oxygen out that
looks really cold

00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:39.010
very very cool drip off the nitrogen
press the button and here's what we get

00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:49.700
it's actually so cold right now the
button is barely even releasing I do see

00:03:49.700 --> 00:03:53.210
some liquid dropping out there do you
see that we just have a couple little

00:03:53.210 --> 00:04:00.830
drops yeah there it is look at that we
are in fact getting liquid oxygen not

00:04:00.830 --> 00:04:04.190
much to hold it up here maybe you could
see it better I think that's about all

00:04:04.190 --> 00:04:07.130
we're going to get this bottle is
completely empty now but check it out we

00:04:07.130 --> 00:04:10.520
did it managed to get a little bit of
liquid oxygen come look at this right

00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:14.780
down there in the bottom boiling away is
a little bit of what I think is liquid

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:17.050
oxygen

00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:24.130
and it's gone okay so that was well
anti-climatic so yes apparently

00:04:24.130 --> 00:04:27.220
theoretically it is possible to extract
liquid oxygen from one of these

00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:30.220
canisters
however for eleven dollars of oxygen and

00:04:30.220 --> 00:04:34.180
the cost of liquid nitrogen we got such
a little amount I don't even know if

00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:36.759
that was worth it so for this last
experiment I'm going to show you the

00:04:36.759 --> 00:04:39.940
method that I love to use the most for
making liquid oxygen because it's very

00:04:39.940 --> 00:04:43.930
cheap very economical you certainly get
a lot more than an ounce and a half so

00:04:43.930 --> 00:04:47.470
what exactly do we need to generate
liquid oxygen well surprisingly the only

00:04:47.470 --> 00:04:50.320
materials were going to need are a
canister of liquid nitrogen and some

00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:53.830
styrofoam cups now go ahead and grab
yourself a Styrofoam cup in this case

00:04:53.830 --> 00:04:56.410
I'm using eight just to speed the
process we're going to lay them all out

00:04:56.410 --> 00:05:00.039
across the counter now that we got our
styrofoam laid out on the counter we're

00:05:00.039 --> 00:05:02.710
going to take our liquid nitrogen and
fill each of them up individually to the

00:05:02.710 --> 00:05:05.650
top now we're pretty much just going to
step back and let them sit for 25

00:05:05.650 --> 00:05:08.800
minutes
styrofoam axor is a really good

00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:11.740
insulator so we don't lose nearly as
much nitrogen filling these up as we

00:05:11.740 --> 00:05:14.800
would with any other container and the
best part of this nitrogen is this all

00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:20.770
homemade there we go all of our
styrofoam cups are completely filled up

00:05:20.770 --> 00:05:23.830
to the brim they couldn't go anymore
they be able to flowing all we have to

00:05:23.830 --> 00:05:29.099
do at this point now is simply step back
and let them sit for about 25 minutes

00:05:34.919 --> 00:05:38.500
quick update guys it has been an hour
we've been letting this nitrogen just

00:05:38.500 --> 00:05:41.650
sit here what's been happening it has
been taking the oxygen out of the air

00:05:41.650 --> 00:05:44.979
and condensing it and that oxygen is
dripped down to the bottom and stayed

00:05:44.979 --> 00:05:48.430
there until the nitrogen boiled off you
can see each of these containers have

00:05:48.430 --> 00:05:52.210
reduced to about 1/8 of their original
volume and if you look really closely

00:05:52.210 --> 00:05:56.650
you'll notice that the liquid has turned
blue that blue liquid my friends is

00:05:56.650 --> 00:05:59.289
liquid oxygen and now if we take all
eight of these cups and dump them

00:05:59.289 --> 00:06:04.270
together we get one full styrofoam cup
of liquid oxygen very very cool stuff

00:06:04.270 --> 00:06:07.210
the other thing that's really
interesting is how frosty these cups get

00:06:07.210 --> 00:06:09.580
you can see all the different layers
where they've actually taken the

00:06:09.580 --> 00:06:12.639
moisture in the atmosphere and condenser
through the side watch this if I just

00:06:12.639 --> 00:06:18.310
tap these cup gently all the snow falls
off

00:06:18.310 --> 00:06:41.870
fun pretty pretty blue oxygen guys look
how beautiful that is not only do we

00:06:41.870 --> 00:06:45.440
have a full cup of liquid oxygen we
actually have a little bit left over as

00:06:45.440 --> 00:06:48.319
well it's almost like what we would hope
to see if we added blue food coloring

00:06:48.319 --> 00:06:51.050
the liquid nitrogen and it actually
worked but this here is very natural

00:06:51.050 --> 00:06:56.360
oxygen is liquid state is blue and it's
also paramagnetic check this out we take

00:06:56.360 --> 00:06:59.780
something like a strong neodymium magnet
and hold it near the liquid look what

00:06:59.780 --> 00:07:14.209
happens the liquid jumps up onto the
magnet and six

00:07:18.420 --> 00:07:24.440
how crazy is that liquid oxygen responds
to a magnet at least until it burns off

00:07:24.440 --> 00:07:29.970
quite a bit of it on there I can't get
it off it's stuck

00:07:29.970 --> 00:07:33.780
that's cool now I don't have to mention
guys that liquid oxygen unlike liquid

00:07:33.780 --> 00:07:37.110
nitrogen is a very very volatile
substance if it comes in contact with a

00:07:37.110 --> 00:07:41.820
fuel liquid nitrogen is not flammable it
puts out fires but if you add a fuel to

00:07:41.820 --> 00:07:45.690
liquid oxygen and light it off the
results can be explosive so here's what

00:07:45.690 --> 00:07:47.910
I'm thinking guys what do you think
would happen if we popped a pack of

00:07:47.910 --> 00:07:52.860
Pringles so if one of the chips in
liquid oxygen and then let it off shall

00:07:52.860 --> 00:07:59.040
we find out all right so we're going to
move our oxygen over here we're going to

00:07:59.040 --> 00:08:06.870
dip this chip until it gets very very
cold and what I'm hoping is happening is

00:08:06.870 --> 00:08:11.010
it's infusing with oxygen I've never
tried this before so I'm not really sure

00:08:11.010 --> 00:08:16.980
what to expect all right that should be
enough see if I can fish that out not

00:08:16.980 --> 00:08:19.530
easy there we go
all right got my flame going let's light

00:08:19.530 --> 00:08:23.680
it off

00:08:28.430 --> 00:08:33.510
not nearly as fat as I was expecting
Oh and now look it stopped burning it

00:08:33.510 --> 00:08:36.360
was kind of like sizzling and popping
and going quite quickly and now it's

00:08:36.360 --> 00:08:43.409
slowing down let's pour a little bit of
oxygen on it oh yeah we can get it to

00:08:43.409 --> 00:08:59.420
reignite look at that slide that ship
right toward the oxygen Wow

00:08:59.420 --> 00:09:04.440
you see that when the oxygen makes
contact it almost explode every time it

00:09:04.440 --> 00:09:07.560
touches
look at those oxygen here it's just

00:09:07.560 --> 00:09:10.940
going around it it's got the same
similar properties to liquid nitrogen

00:09:10.940 --> 00:09:18.360
delayed in the frost effect what happens
if I cap it it goes into a million

00:09:18.360 --> 00:09:21.680
pieces

00:09:21.680 --> 00:09:26.460
isn't these chips just randomly spark up
that's cool all right let's try that

00:09:26.460 --> 00:09:29.310
again let's get one of these chips
soaking but the oxygen burns off a

00:09:29.310 --> 00:09:31.710
little too quickly so what I'm going to
do is pour a little bit of oxygen into

00:09:31.710 --> 00:09:39.900
the plate as well before we actually let
it off okay there's our chip we're going

00:09:39.900 --> 00:09:48.009
to set that right there and let it off

00:09:49.589 --> 00:09:57.019
more oxygen

00:09:58.800 --> 00:10:05.320
oh yes that's very vigorous

00:10:05.320 --> 00:10:21.190
oh wow
look at all these pieces of Pringle

00:10:21.190 --> 00:10:26.830
floating around you got black blobs of
Kringle filling the entire airspace

00:10:26.830 --> 00:10:31.330
above my head that's kind of nasty and
finally let's just do the Styrofoam cup

00:10:31.330 --> 00:11:11.749
itself there goes oh my goodness look at
the ceiling oh that was a bad idea

00:11:13.500 --> 00:11:16.510
there you have a guys that was
incredible and now you know how to use

00:11:16.510 --> 00:11:20.950
liquid nitrogen and styrofoam cups to
make liquid oxygen right out of the air

00:11:20.950 --> 00:11:24.430
we start off filling up eight cups with
liquid nitrogen right to the top then

00:11:24.430 --> 00:11:27.910
let them sit for about an hour until all
the nitrogen had boiled off but in the

00:11:27.910 --> 00:11:31.450
process of the nitrogen boiling off the
oxygen in the atmosphere condensed and

00:11:31.450 --> 00:11:34.329
was sucked into the cups and when we
mixed all eight of those cups together

00:11:34.329 --> 00:11:38.709
we had a cup overflowing of blue liquid
oxygen which apparently is paramagnetic

00:11:38.709 --> 00:11:42.610
just keep in mind that liquid oxygen can
be very very dangerous stuff and if it

00:11:42.610 --> 00:11:46.120
catches anything on fire you can make a
terrible mess thanks for joining me for

00:11:46.120 --> 00:11:53.980
this experiment guys I'll be looking for
you the next one talk to you then that

00:11:53.980 --> 00:11:59.140
was unexpected that got frost you didn't
it whoo the cryo container freezing my

00:11:59.140 --> 00:12:02.820
fingers looks very cool

00:12:12.970 --> 00:12:15.029
Outro
