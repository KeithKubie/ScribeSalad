00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:04.430
The answer is that the Car function would run in the context of the global scope

00:00:04.430 --> 00:00:08.535
because this Car function is being invoked as a free function invocation.

00:00:08.535 --> 00:00:11.230
. You would actually wind up with a global loc variable pointing to

00:00:11.230 --> 00:00:15.020
the number 9 and your Van instance would be completely unaffected by any

00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:16.200
code within the Car function.
