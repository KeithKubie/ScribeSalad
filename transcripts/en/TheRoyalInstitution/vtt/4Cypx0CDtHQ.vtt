[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:30.194 --> 00:00:31.860
Competitive diving is
one of the most

00:00:31.860 --> 00:00:33.666
beautiful Olympic sports.

00:00:33.666 --> 00:00:36.900
It requires strength, ability,
and above all, courage.

00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:42.050
Up here on a 10-metre board, it
takes just a second and a

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:49.920
half before you hit the water
at about 30 miles an hour.

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:53.310
And in that second and a half,
the athlete has got to do

00:00:53.310 --> 00:00:57.170
complex somersaults, twists, got
to understand the heights,

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:59.970
and got to understand
the angle of entry.

00:00:59.970 --> 00:01:02.530
So how does the diver do that?

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:04.550
And that's where the
coach comes in.

00:01:04.550 --> 00:01:07.620
So before the diver surfaces
from the water, the coach has

00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:10.380
got to come up with the answer
to the question what do I tell

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:11.630
my athletes?

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:50.692
Okay you stopped it well, good
rip, it's a little bit quick.

00:01:50.692 --> 00:01:52.120
You should try diving.

00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:53.840
I give them feedback
that helps them

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:54.550
achieve their goals.

00:01:54.550 --> 00:01:57.540
And that's the goals for that
session, the goals for that

00:01:57.540 --> 00:01:59.455
training cycle, and ultimately,
the goals that

00:01:59.455 --> 00:02:02.260
will get them towards elite
performance and hopefully an

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:03.510
Olympic medal.

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:07.950
So, Adam, we've worked
together for a

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:09.479
number of years now.

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:14.070
We've installed six cameras,
four force platforms, two

00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:16.170
enormous TV screens.

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:18.610
How do you use those to
help your athletes?

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:21.985
Well, we use it to gives lots
and lots and lots of feedback.

00:02:21.985 --> 00:02:25.520
And of the different kinds of
feedback we get, we can choose

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:28.260
which ones of those the athletes
respond best to and

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:30.700
make sure they get more
information in that style.

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:33.130
In the first instance, you've
got your coach's eye.

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:35.950
You're looking at them and
saying, internally, that looks

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:37.370
right or that doesn't
look right.

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:38.710
This is why.

00:02:38.710 --> 00:02:41.850
And then the iPad and the video
and the force data gives

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:44.280
you a bit more information that
says yes, I was right

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:45.170
with what I thought.

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:47.960
Or actually, this is new
information, so I'm going to

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:51.350
turn that into a postural
correction or a timing

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:54.640
correction that's hopefully
easy for the diver to make

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:59.630
happen to get them closer to
my coach's eye and my data

00:02:59.630 --> 00:03:00.990
idea of perfect.

00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:03.980
By the time they've come up from
the water, you've got all

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:04.805
of that ready.

00:03:04.805 --> 00:03:06.970
You tap your tablet, as
they hit the water.

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:10.160
That goes and grabs the last
few seconds of video data.

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:12.550
And by the time the diver comes
around, they can have

00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:13.670
seen their replay on
the big screen.

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:17.470
And then we go into a little bit
of detail with them in a

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:21.420
way that works for them and
leads to a technical change

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:22.670
that makes them a little
bit better.

00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:39.600
I think it was more
my legs did that.

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:41.460
They did exactly the
right thing.

00:03:41.460 --> 00:03:42.480
It just needs a little
bit of zip.

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:43.730
So it takes that out.

00:03:46.730 --> 00:03:47.820
So we've got the video of Ben.

00:03:47.820 --> 00:03:50.280
This is the high-speed video
link to the force plate data

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:51.730
and we can play the
video through.

00:03:51.730 --> 00:03:52.790
Oh, wow.

00:03:52.790 --> 00:03:53.720
I love that

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:55.680
You can see the line projected
on-screen.

00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:58.330
And if the line's longer,
he's pushing harder.

00:03:58.330 --> 00:04:00.380
And depending on what direction
the line goes,

00:04:00.380 --> 00:04:02.250
that's the direction he's
pushing into the tower.

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:04.860
So here, for example, you see
he's pushing back quite hard.

00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:07.645
Now the graph, up here, tells
the coach and the diver if

00:04:07.645 --> 00:04:10.450
they want it, a, how hard in
terms of Newtons they were

00:04:10.450 --> 00:04:13.000
pushing on the tower in two
different directions.

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:15.950
So the green line shows how hard
he was pushing down onto

00:04:15.950 --> 00:04:18.350
the tower, the red line shows
the x-direction--

00:04:18.350 --> 00:04:19.919
how hard he was pushing
forwards or backwards.

00:04:19.919 --> 00:04:20.940
OK, let me just give
that a go .

00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:21.860
That is fantastic.

00:04:21.860 --> 00:04:22.390
I love that.

00:04:22.390 --> 00:04:24.830
So having that, and having on
it here, by the side of the

00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:27.790
pool, being able to do that--
that is just wonderful seeing

00:04:27.790 --> 00:04:29.040
those force vectors.

00:04:35.230 --> 00:04:38.890
So what the top athlete has is
instinct and judgement .

00:04:38.890 --> 00:04:40.220
But he needs more.

00:04:40.220 --> 00:04:43.350
At the elite level, you need
evidence-based understanding

00:04:43.350 --> 00:04:44.810
to get those incremental
changes.

00:04:44.810 --> 00:04:47.660
And it's the job of the sports
engineer to take the

00:04:47.660 --> 00:04:50.950
measurements, to understand it,
and to impart it back to

00:04:50.950 --> 00:04:53.250
the athlete and coach, so
they can be the very

00:04:53.250 --> 00:04:54.500
best that they can.

00:05:01.905 --> 00:05:03.450
I love it.

00:05:03.450 --> 00:05:29.142
