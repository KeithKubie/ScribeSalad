00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:03.820
So here's the original elevator demo, where we read in an integer, or we're

00:00:03.820 --> 00:00:07.240
hoping it's going to be an integer, and then we use it here for that first

00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:13.536
demonstration of a new statement. Our task is to make sure that we get a valid

00:00:13.536 --> 00:00:18.420
integer here. Someone was kind enough to supply us with the bits and pieces

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:25.700
that we need. Here is the check where the, the user mistakenly enters 13.

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:31.312
Whether the floor is less than 1 or greater than 18. And finally, where that's

00:00:31.312 --> 00:00:36.119
not an integer at all. Our job is to put these together in the right order.

00:00:36.119 --> 00:00:40.944
Now, the first 2 checks already assume that the user entered an integer. So we

00:00:40.944 --> 00:00:46.268
should use the sur check first to test for that. Let's cut it out, and paste it

00:00:46.268 --> 00:00:51.340
into the main method, and fix up the flow. So, we have our scanner, we're

00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:55.180
prompting the user to type something in, and now we're checking what the user

00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:59.255
types. And if that's successful, then we call nextInt. And that gets us to

00:00:59.255 --> 00:01:04.530
where we were here. So, everything that's down here needs to get inserted here.

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:08.740
Let's do that. So, if the user entered an integer, we grab the integer and we

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:14.806
do our computation. Let's move on to the other tests. Here they are. Again,

00:01:14.806 --> 00:01:17.915
I'll cut them out. So, these one's only make sense after I have read in the

00:01:17.915 --> 00:01:22.276
next input as an integer. So I'll paste them in here. So if the floor is 13, I

00:01:22.276 --> 00:01:28.628
print an error. If it's less than equal 0 or greater than 18, I print an error.

00:01:28.628 --> 00:01:32.156
this isn't really going to work because I'm printing the error and then I still

00:01:32.156 --> 00:01:37.504
continue with all of these things. What I really need to say is if this error

00:01:37.504 --> 00:01:44.210
happens, print the error, else go on here. Let me do that. So I have enclosed

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:49.180
all of the original action inside this else. Now peaking up, there still is a

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:54.080
bit of an issue with control flow. The floor is 13, then it does this, and then

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:58.844
in all cases, whether or not it's 13, it makes this check. So we also want to

00:01:58.844 --> 00:02:03.160
put an else in here. So first we check whether the number is even an integer.

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:09.190
If so, we check whether it's one of these two special situations. And finally

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:14.240
here we know that it is a good input, and we do our regular thing. Note that we

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:19.390
have three levels of nesting. This if contains this if, and the else branch

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:22.330
here contains another if. C'est la vie.
