00:00:04.320 --> 00:00:07.940
From the creator of your older sister’s
favorite 80’s movies

00:00:07.940 --> 00:00:10.510
and the Chris Columbus that didn’t kill
any Indians

00:00:10.510 --> 00:00:16.000
comes the Christmas classic that cable channels
have rerun every holiday season for the last

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:17.500
20 years.

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:18.500
20?

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:19.830
God that makes me feel old...

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:20.880
Home Alone.

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:26.009
Deck the halls and gather round for a family
film about standing your ground

00:00:26.009 --> 00:00:28.130
"Hello!"

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:31.020
in one of the most violent kids movies ever
made,

00:00:31.020 --> 00:00:32.940
that’s one part Ferris Bueller

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:36.789
and one part Saw.

00:00:36.789 --> 00:00:45.520
This Christmas, travel to the all-white part
of Chicago

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:47.530
to meet the Mcallisters

00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:49.280
the worst family ever.

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:51.359
"Kevin, you're such a disease."

00:00:51.359 --> 00:00:56.050
Rejoice in the Christmas spirit as they gang
up on this 8-year-old boy.

00:00:56.050 --> 00:00:57.629
"Don't you know how to knock, phlegm-wad?"

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:00.570
"You're completely helpless."

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:01.570
"Look what ya did, you little jerk!"

00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:03.899
"Everyone in this family hates me!"

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:05.820
Then stick him in the attic and leave the
country.

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:08.930
"What else could we be forgetting?"

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:10.610
"Mom?"

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:15.710
Witness years of neglect and abuse take their
toll on this small child,

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:19.170
as he shows all the signs of becoming a sociopath,
like

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:20.170
manipulation,

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:21.170
"Go."

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:22.170
"I'm sorry."

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:23.170
talking to himself,

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:28.310
"I can't seem to find my toothbrush so I'll
pick one up when I go out today."

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:33.049
and trapping two non-violent criminals inside
a sadistic world of torture from which there

00:01:33.049 --> 00:01:37.509
is no escape.

00:01:37.509 --> 00:01:41.250
But gosh darn if he isn’t just the cutest
little thing.

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:43.600
Meet the “Wet Bandits."

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:47.479
There’s Marv, who sounds like the narrator
from the Wonder Years.

00:01:47.479 --> 00:01:49.770
"Kids are scared of the dark."

00:01:49.770 --> 00:02:00.090
And Harry, who sounds like Joe Pesci trying
not to curse in a PG movie.

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:03.649
Watch as these bumbling idiots

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:05.729
only rob from one block in broad daylight,

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:08.430
wear fingerless gloves during a burglary,

00:02:08.430 --> 00:02:10.729
and are irrationally obsessed with one house

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:12.130
"That's the one, Marvin.

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:13.530
That's the silver tuna."

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:19.080
that's really just full of mannequins and
poinsettias.

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:25.190
Seriously, there’s like nothing there worth
stealing here.

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:28.980
So bundle up and relive the early 90’s joy
of

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:30.660
Micro Machines,

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:32.230

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:38.220
answering machines,

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:40.610
pre-9/11 air travel,

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:42.960
and McCaulay Culkin.

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:44.530
"Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!"

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:51.300
Prepare to have your heartstrings tugged as
Kevin, who’s been Home Alone for 3 days,

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:54.120
is finally reunited with his family

00:02:54.120 --> 00:03:02.950
then immediately left alone again.

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:04.130
That was awkward.

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:05.130

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:24.180
Oh man...

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:27.220
This scene always gets me.

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:29.360
I'm not crying!

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:30.790
You're crying!

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:40.870
I 

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:48.900
really should call my dad!
