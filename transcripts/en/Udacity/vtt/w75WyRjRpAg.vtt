00:00:00.430 --> 00:00:01.673
Hey Charles, how's it goin'?

00:00:01.673 --> 00:00:03.800
&gt;&gt; It's going pretty well Michael. How's it going with you?

00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:04.860
&gt;&gt; Good, thank you.

00:00:04.860 --> 00:00:07.140
&gt;&gt; Good, good, good. Guess what we're going to talk about today?

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:08.750
&gt;&gt; Well, reading off this screen, it looks

00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:11.360
like maybe ensemble learning, and boosting, whatever that is.

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:12.720
&gt;&gt; Yes, that's exactly what we're

00:00:12.720 --> 00:00:14.010
going to talk about. We're going to talk about

00:00:14.010 --> 00:00:18.650
a class of algorithms called ensemble learners. And I think you will See

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:21.310
that they're related to some of the stuff that we've been doing already,

00:00:21.310 --> 00:00:24.700
and in particular we're going to spend most of our time focusing on, boosting.

00:00:25.850 --> 00:00:27.350
because boosting is my favorite of the

00:00:27.350 --> 00:00:29.790
ensemble learning algorithms. So you ready for that?

00:00:29.790 --> 00:00:30.860
&gt;&gt; Yeah! Let's do it.

00:00:30.860 --> 00:00:33.470
&gt;&gt; Okay. So, I want to start this out by,

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:35.790
going through a little exercise with you. I want you

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:38.840
to think about a problem. Okay. And the particular

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:41.980
problem I want you to think about is, spam email.

00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:44.430
&gt;&gt; Mm, I think about that a lot.

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:47.980
&gt;&gt; So, normally if we were thinking of this a classification

00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:51.040
task, right, where we're going to take some email and we're going to decide

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:53.780
if it's spam or not. Given what we've talked about so

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:57.590
far we would be thinking about using a decision tree or

00:00:57.590 --> 00:01:01.530
you know neural networks or kNN whatever that means

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:03.400
with email. We would be coming up with all of these sort

00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:06.330
of complicated things. I want to propose an alternative which is

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:09.740
going to get us to ensemble learn. OK and here's the alternative.

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:12.820
I don't want you to try to think of some complicated

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:16.360
Rule that you might come up with that would capture spam email.

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:19.420
Instead, I want you to come up with some simple rules

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:21.810
that are indicative of spam email. Okay, so let me be

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:25.270
specific, Michael. We have this problem with spam email. That is,

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:28.910
you you're going to get some email message and you want some computer

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:32.170
program To figure out automatically for you if something is a

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:35.350
piece of spam or it isn't. And I want you to help

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:38.260
write a set of rules that'll help me to figure that

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:41.710
out. And I want you to think about simple rules, so can

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:45.080
you think of any simple rules that might indicate that something is spam?

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:47.650
&gt;&gt; Alright I can, yeah I can think of some simple rules. I don't think

00:01:47.650 --> 00:01:55.310
they would be very good, but they might better than nothing. Like If for example

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:59.830
it mentions how manly I am, I, I would be, be willing to believe that

00:01:59.830 --> 00:02:03.780
was a spam message. So like if the body of the message contains the word manly.

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:07.690
&gt;&gt; Okay, I like that. like that when body

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:09.490
contains manly.

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:15.980
I like that rule, because I often get non-spam messages talking about

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:19.260
manly. So I guess one man's spam is another man's normal email.

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:21.310
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] I guess that's true.

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:23.590
&gt;&gt; Probably. Any other rules?

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:27.740
&gt;&gt; Sure if it, you know if it comes from my spouse it's probably not spam.

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:31.070
&gt;&gt; OK, so let's see, from spouse.

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:34.650
&gt;&gt; Her name's Lisa. Now we're going to call our spouse. So

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:37.080
let's say minus, I'm going to go to plus here, so we know

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:39.610
some rules are indicitive of being spam, and some

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:42.250
rules are indicitive of not being spam. Okay, anything else?

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:48.534
&gt;&gt; Possibly the length of the message. I guess. Like what?

00:02:48.534 --> 00:02:50.090
&gt;&gt; I don't know. I don't know that this would be very

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:52.180
accurate, but I think some of this, some of the spam I

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:54.840
get sometimes is very, very short just like the, it's like the

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:58.480
URL. Like hey, check out this site, and then there's a URL.

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:02.770
&gt;&gt; Hm, I like that. So, we'll just say short.

00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:06.070
Just contains URLs. Hm, I like those rules. Let's see if we can

00:03:06.070 --> 00:03:09.290
think of anything else. Oh, how about this one. It's just an image.

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:10.580
&gt;&gt; Hm.

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:13.190
&gt;&gt; I get a lot of those where it's just an image.

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:15.510
&gt;&gt; I see, like in it's it's and if you

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:18.130
look at the picture it's all various pharmaceuticals from Canada.

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:20.500
&gt;&gt; Exactly. Here's one I get a lot.

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:21.840
&gt;&gt; Hm,

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:28.870
&gt;&gt; Lots of misspelled words that you end up reading as being

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:29.540
a real word.

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:31.850
&gt;&gt; Hm. But I don't know how I'd write that

00:03:31.850 --> 00:03:34.380
as a rule. Or you could just list the words.

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:36.930
&gt;&gt; Like rules that, words that have already

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:39.320
been modified in that way. I guess so.

00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:41.570
&gt;&gt; Yeah, kind of a, kind of a black list, a black list of words.

00:03:41.570 --> 00:03:45.960
&gt;&gt; Okay so, words like, I would say manly, but you were saying prawn.

00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:49.110
&gt;&gt; Or whatever that says. yeah, so they're and they're tons

00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:51.450
of these. Right? I mean, another one that's, that's very popular

00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:56.610
if you're old enough anyway is this one, remember this one?

00:03:56.610 --> 00:04:00.200
&gt;&gt; Oh, sure that was sometimes a virus, right?

00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:04.900
&gt;&gt; Yes. Our young, our younger viewers will not know this but this was one

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:07.670
of the first big spam messages that would

00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:09.910
get out there. Make money fast. And there's

00:04:09.910 --> 00:04:13.920
tons and tons of these. We could come up with a bunch of them. Now, here's

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:15.330
something they all kind of have in common,

00:04:15.330 --> 00:04:18.640
Michael, and you've touched on this all ready.

00:04:18.640 --> 00:04:23.930
All of them are sort of right. They're useful but no one of them is going to be

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:27.340
very good at telling us whether a message has

00:04:27.340 --> 00:04:31.370
spam on its own. Right. So the word manly is

00:04:31.370 --> 00:04:33.930
evidence but it's not enough to decide whether something

00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:37.190
is spam or not. It's from your spouse, it's evidence

00:04:37.190 --> 00:04:41.390
it's not spam, but sometimes you get messages from

00:04:41.390 --> 00:04:43.680
your spouse that are in fact spam, because in fact,

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:46.210
she didn't actually send them. You know, and so

00:04:46.210 --> 00:04:48.310
on and so forth. And sometimes she did email

00:04:48.310 --> 00:04:51.670
from Princes in Nigeria. I didn't. And they're not

00:04:51.670 --> 00:04:55.200
always spam. I, I actually do, but any case,

00:04:55.200 --> 00:04:56.880
sometimes people are asking you for money, and maybe

00:04:56.880 --> 00:04:58.250
that's message you want to ignore, but it isn't

00:04:58.250 --> 00:05:02.140
necessarily spam. And some people are very interested in

00:05:02.140 --> 00:05:04.970
getting like this and don't consider it spam, right?

00:05:04.970 --> 00:05:08.880
&gt;&gt; So, so, okay, so I can see that these would

00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:12.300
all maybe provide some evidence, but it seems really hard tp figure out the

00:05:12.300 --> 00:05:15.290
right way of combining them all together to I don't know, make a decision.

00:05:15.290 --> 00:05:16.700
&gt;&gt; Right, this is exactly right. And by the

00:05:16.700 --> 00:05:18.760
way, if you think about something like decision tree, you

00:05:18.760 --> 00:05:20.980
could. There's really a sort of similar problem going on

00:05:20.980 --> 00:05:22.680
there. We can think of each of the nodes in

00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:25.210
a decision tree as being a very simple rule and

00:05:25.210 --> 00:05:27.840
the decision tree tells us how to combine them. Right?

00:05:27.840 --> 00:05:29.550
So, we need to figure out how to do that

00:05:29.550 --> 00:05:34.200
here and that is the fundamental notion of ensemble learning.

00:05:34.200 --> 00:05:36.620
&gt;&gt; But wait, isn't, couldn't you also do something similar with

00:05:36.620 --> 00:05:39.680
something like neural net. Right? Where each of these now becomes a

00:05:39.680 --> 00:05:41.970
feature and we're just trying to learn weights for combining them

00:05:41.970 --> 00:05:44.770
all together. So That would kind of satisfy what you were talking about.

00:05:44.770 --> 00:05:48.050
&gt;&gt; True, I mean I think the the difference here in this case and

00:05:48.050 --> 00:05:49.640
and I think you're absolutely right but

00:05:49.640 --> 00:05:51.280
one difference here is that typically with the

00:05:51.280 --> 00:05:54.040
new network we've already built the network

00:05:54.040 --> 00:05:55.570
itself and the nodes and we're trying

00:05:55.570 --> 00:05:57.480
to learn the weights whereas in something

00:05:57.480 --> 00:05:59.370
like a decision tree you're building up rules

00:05:59.370 --> 00:06:03.050
as you go along. And typically with ensemble learning you're building up a

00:06:03.050 --> 00:06:05.880
bunch of rules and combining them together until you got something that's good

00:06:05.880 --> 00:06:07.320
enough. But you're absolutely right. You

00:06:07.320 --> 00:06:09.170
could think of neural networks as being

00:06:09.170 --> 00:06:12.180
an ensemble of little parts. Sometimes

00:06:12.180 --> 00:06:14.130
hard to understand, but an ensemble nonetheless.
