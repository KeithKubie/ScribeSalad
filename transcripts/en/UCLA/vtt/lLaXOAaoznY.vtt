00:00:01.820 --> 00:00:05.380
So we're missing um like a few.

00:00:05.380 --> 00:00:08.600
Gabriel? Oh no.. how are you dear?

00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:09.860
Are you with us?

00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:16.140
we're gonna take the 720 and I'm going
to try to point things out as we go

00:00:16.140 --> 00:00:20.160
what the hell is going on here. So we are on Wilshire.

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:27.220
as we move east we enter into areas
which are not as wealthy

00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:35.240
I can see parts of LA that I hadn't previously seen. Just a whole new experience.

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:38.540
Skid Row is there we're gonna go on the edges of it

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:43.680
because I don't want to be a kind of
tourist of misery

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:52.360
This is Union Station look here always
at the ceilings. We're going to see the

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:56.789
tremendous care that is done in this
roof. This was bustling with activity we

00:00:56.789 --> 00:01:00.360
are going across which is Olvera
Street this is where the

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:03.900
Pueblo Los Angeles was born.

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:13.600
Before the music begins
again this is the oldest house existent

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:22.080
in Los Angeles it actually dates to 1818
when this was a still part of Spain

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:33.990
Chinatown is there unfortunately we
don't have enough time to do that

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:39.600
And all those people dressed in white are
being baptized. Ooh look at that one!

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:42.200
Â¡Que bonita!

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:44.640
[homelessness] moving up here

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:50.380
We should have crossed

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:56.160
we are going into the Cathedral of Our
Lady of Los Angeles a very controversial

00:01:56.160 --> 00:02:01.800
architectural building. It does not fit
the kind of idea of what a Cathedral should

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:05.000
look like

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:11.520
I mean I've been all here but I don't
know the history behind it and that's

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:15.800
what the professor is for. oh yeah he's
really nice yeah funny

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:20.600
this is the Ahmanson
art complex

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:25.320
The Disney Concert Hall. Incredible acoustics

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:40.120
I have been coming
here for 20 years

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:54.640
the man was called Bradbury the owner
and a draftsman man in his firm supposedly

00:02:54.640 --> 00:03:00.200
consulted a ouji board all kinds of
movies are filmed in this in this

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:06.720
building which is my favorite building
in LA

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:13.120
there is a room there where the Oscars took place for the first time

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:16.480
it's really nice, it's interesting to come

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:19.300
with the group and learn a little bit
more about the history

00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:21.840
people say to me 'how do you know this?'

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:25.380
I am 250 years old

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:28.160
how many things do we have left?

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:30.300
let's do it

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:33.520
It's very immersive I feel like

00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:36.480
I feel like an actual Angelino for once

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:38.440
we're going to see that there is a children's

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:41.520
library all the people who live in the
neighborhood come to the library with

00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:45.520
the children and so on but I want to
show you this frescoes here

00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:53.040
the ones on top are very interesting and quite
damning the missionaries arrive

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:57.960
the natives are delighted to see them can I
work for you they said there was

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:02.000
continuous genocide against the Native
Americans

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:06.120
but this is how you construct history

00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:17.120
we left at 10 and we are going back
after five and still not enough time

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:23.320
what I want them to see is to see the
diversity of the city

00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:25.520
the nature of this

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:30.880
ethnic and racial and linguistic
diversity. That diversity is creative

00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:35.980
That diversity is something
that we should all embrace completely

00:04:35.980 --> 00:04:40.469
and I believe that
