00:00:14.516 --> 00:00:16.611
The Five Fingers of Evolution.

00:00:17.252 --> 00:00:19.385
A thorough understanding of biology

00:00:19.409 --> 00:00:23.070
requires a thorough understanding
of the process of evolution.

00:00:23.094 --> 00:00:26.246
Most people are familiar
with the process of natural selection.

00:00:26.270 --> 00:00:28.814
However, this is just one
of five processes

00:00:28.838 --> 00:00:30.787
that can result in evolution.

00:00:30.811 --> 00:00:33.482
Before we discuss
all five of these processes,

00:00:33.506 --> 00:00:35.381
we should define evolution.

00:00:35.405 --> 00:00:39.030
Evolution is simply change
in the gene pool over time.

00:00:39.054 --> 00:00:40.303
But what is a gene pool?

00:00:40.327 --> 00:00:42.772
And for that matter, what is a gene?

00:00:42.796 --> 00:00:44.976
Before spending any more time on genetics,

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:46.868
let us begin with a story.

00:00:47.677 --> 00:00:49.455
Imagine that a boat capsizes,

00:00:49.479 --> 00:00:52.635
and 10 survivors
swim to shore on a deserted island.

00:00:52.659 --> 00:00:53.845
They are never rescued,

00:00:53.869 --> 00:00:57.506
and they form a new population
that exists for thousands of years.

00:00:57.530 --> 00:01:00.649
Strangely enough,
five of the survivors have red hair.

00:01:00.988 --> 00:01:03.868
Red hair is created
when a person inherits two copies

00:01:03.892 --> 00:01:05.829
of the red gene from their parents.

00:01:05.853 --> 00:01:09.099
If you only have one copy of the gene,
you won't have red hair.

00:01:09.123 --> 00:01:10.976
To make this easier, we will assume

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:14.523
that the five non-redheads
are not carriers of the gene.

00:01:14.547 --> 00:01:18.154
The initial frequency of the red-hair gene
is therefore 50 percent,

00:01:18.178 --> 00:01:20.260
or 10 of 20 total genes.

00:01:20.832 --> 00:01:22.609
These genes are the gene pool.

00:01:22.998 --> 00:01:25.685
The 20 different genes
are like cards in a deck

00:01:25.709 --> 00:01:28.903
that keep getting reshuffled
with each new generation.

00:01:28.927 --> 00:01:32.227
Sex is simply a reshuffling
of the genetic deck.

00:01:33.227 --> 00:01:36.891
The cards are reshuffled
and passed to the next generation;

00:01:36.915 --> 00:01:39.586
the deck remains the same, 50 percent red.

00:01:40.221 --> 00:01:43.890
The genes are reshuffled
and passed to the next generation;

00:01:43.914 --> 00:01:47.149
the gene pool remains
the same, 50 percent red.

00:01:47.877 --> 00:01:50.871
Even though the population
may grow in size over time,

00:01:50.895 --> 00:01:53.498
the frequency should stay
at about 50 percent.

00:01:53.874 --> 00:01:57.056
If this frequency ever varies,
then evolution has occurred.

00:01:57.080 --> 00:02:00.270
Evolution is simply change
in the gene pool over time.

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:02.845
Think about it in terms of the cards.

00:02:02.869 --> 00:02:05.784
If the frequency of the cards
in the deck ever changes,

00:02:05.808 --> 00:02:07.361
evolution has occurred.

00:02:07.385 --> 00:02:11.329
There are five processes
that can cause the frequency to change.

00:02:11.353 --> 00:02:14.976
To remember these processes,
we will use the fingers on your hands,

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.105
starting from the little finger
and moving to the thumb.

00:02:18.129 --> 00:02:21.721
The little finger should remind you
that the population can shrink.

00:02:21.745 --> 00:02:24.495
If the population shrinks,
then chance can take over.

00:02:24.989 --> 00:02:28.542
For example, if only four
individuals survive an epidemic,

00:02:28.566 --> 00:02:31.364
then their genes will represent
the new gene pool.

00:02:31.958 --> 00:02:33.780
The next finger is the ring finger.

00:02:33.804 --> 00:02:37.938
This finger should remind you of mating,
because a ring represents a couple.

00:02:38.428 --> 00:02:42.057
If individuals choose a mate
based on their appearance or location,

00:02:42.081 --> 00:02:43.765
the frequency may change.

00:02:43.789 --> 00:02:47.370
If redheaded individuals only mate
with redheaded individuals,

00:02:47.394 --> 00:02:49.560
they could eventually
form a new population.

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:52.542
If no one ever mates
with redheaded individuals,

00:02:52.566 --> 00:02:54.256
these genes could decrease.

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:56.042
The next finger is the middle finger.

00:02:56.066 --> 00:03:00.043
The M in the middle finger should remind
you of the M in the word "mutation."

00:03:00.067 --> 00:03:03.694
If a new gene is added through mutation,
it can affect the frequency.

00:03:04.128 --> 00:03:07.350
Imagine a gene mutation
creates a new color of hair.

00:03:07.374 --> 00:03:10.328
This would obviously change
the frequency in the gene pool.

00:03:10.352 --> 00:03:12.884
The pointer finger
should remind you of movement.

00:03:12.908 --> 00:03:16.183
If new individuals
flow into an area, or immigrate,

00:03:16.207 --> 00:03:17.738
the frequency will change.

00:03:17.762 --> 00:03:20.625
If individuals flow out
of an area, or emigrate,

00:03:20.649 --> 00:03:22.129
then the frequency will change.

00:03:22.153 --> 00:03:25.793
In science, we refer to this
movement as gene flow.

00:03:26.365 --> 00:03:31.022
All four of the processes represented
by our fingers can cause evolution.

00:03:31.046 --> 00:03:34.421
Small population size, non-random mating,

00:03:34.445 --> 00:03:36.976
mutations and gene flow.

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:39.899
However, none of them lead to adaptation.

00:03:39.923 --> 00:03:42.154
Natural selection is the only process

00:03:42.178 --> 00:03:45.733
that creates organisms
better adapted to their local environment.

00:03:46.061 --> 00:03:48.436
I use the thumb to remember this process.

00:03:48.460 --> 00:03:52.598
Nature votes thumbs up for adaptations
that will do well in their environment,

00:03:52.622 --> 00:03:55.319
and thumbs down to adaptations
that will do poorly.

00:03:55.741 --> 00:03:59.566
The genes for individuals
that are not adapted for their environment

00:03:59.590 --> 00:04:02.665
will gradually be replaced
by those that are better adapted.

00:04:03.183 --> 00:04:05.990
Red hair is an example
of one of these adaptations.

00:04:06.379 --> 00:04:09.073
Red hair is an advantage
in the northern climates,

00:04:09.097 --> 00:04:13.148
because the fair skin
allowed ancestors to absorb more light

00:04:13.172 --> 00:04:15.216
and synthesize more vitamin D.

00:04:15.240 --> 00:04:16.445
Thumbs up!

00:04:16.469 --> 00:04:19.422
However, this was a disadvantage
in the more southern climates,

00:04:19.446 --> 00:04:24.291
where increased UV radiation
led to cancer and decreased fertility.

00:04:24.315 --> 00:04:25.576
Thumbs down!

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:27.583
Even the thumb itself is an adaptation

00:04:27.607 --> 00:04:29.965
formed through the process
of natural selection.

00:04:30.694 --> 00:04:34.570
The evolution that we have described
is referred to as microevolution,

00:04:34.594 --> 00:04:36.622
because it refers to a small change.

00:04:36.646 --> 00:04:38.163
However, this form of evolution

00:04:38.187 --> 00:04:41.424
may eventually lead
to macroevolution, or speciation.

00:04:42.035 --> 00:04:46.289
Every organism on the planet shares
ancestry with a single common ancestor.

00:04:46.858 --> 00:04:50.117
All living organisms on the planet
are connected back in time

00:04:50.141 --> 00:04:51.805
through the process of evolution.

00:04:52.420 --> 00:04:53.920
Take a look at your own hand.

00:04:53.944 --> 00:04:55.606
It's an engineering masterpiece

00:04:55.630 --> 00:04:58.631
that was created by the five
processes I just described,

00:04:58.655 --> 00:05:00.539
over millions and millions of years.

00:05:01.101 --> 00:05:04.604
Can you recall the five main
causes of evolution from memory?

00:05:04.628 --> 00:05:07.282
If you can't, hit rewind
and watch that part again.

00:05:07.706 --> 00:05:08.941
But if you can,

00:05:08.965 --> 00:05:13.530
give yourself or your neighbor
a big five-fingered high five.
