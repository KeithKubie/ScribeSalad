00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
We can compute this using the formula for conditional probability.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:09.000
In this case what A is is the probability the coin toss is valid.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:18.000
A is valid, and we know that the probability of A is equal to 0.99998.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
What B is is the probability that it's heads.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:29.000
So the probability of B is the probability of H, which is 0.49999.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.000
Now we just have to plug these into the formula.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.000
But what we need to use the formula is the probability of A intersect B.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:42.000
And what A is the probability of A intersect B. What A is is valid.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.000
Instead of heads and tails, what B is is heads.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:52.000
If we intersect heads and tails with heads, we get tails.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:57.000
We know the probability of tails is 0.49999.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:04.000
That means using the formula we have the probability of tails, which is 0.49999,

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.000
which is the probability of A intersect B.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:12.000
We're dividing that by the probability of A,

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:18.000
which is a valid event which is 0.99998.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.000
We get 0.5.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.000
I should note that this is not the case for real coin tosses.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:28.000
There is no physical coin ever manufactured that has exactly

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.000
chances of landing on both sides.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:34.000
In fact, with real coin tosses, at least with American currency,

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:39.000
there is a much higher percentage--much higher meaning close to 51%

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:43.000
rather than 50%--that the coin lands on the same side that it started on.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.000
When we talk about mathematical coin tosses,

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.000
we're going to assume that there is no edge case

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.000
and that it's equally likely

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:53.000
that we have a uniform distribution and there are only 2 outcomes.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:56.000
When we talk about mathematical coin tosses,

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.000
we're going to assume that we have a uniform distribution,

00:01:58.000 --> 99:59:59.000
and there are only two outcomes.
