00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:03.620
At this point, our only code
module is our main activity.

00:00:03.620 --> 00:00:05.590
We'll get back to that
in a little while.

00:00:05.590 --> 00:00:08.450
But first,
let's create our intent service.

00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:12.100
We're going to call
DetectedActivitiesIntentService.

00:00:12.100 --> 00:00:17.530
I'll do this by creating
a new Java class, and

00:00:17.530 --> 00:00:24.600
calling it as I said,
DetectedActivitiesIntentService.

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:26.780
So here you can see my new
class has been created for

00:00:26.780 --> 00:00:30.280
me, but there's a few things I'm
going to need to set this up.

00:00:30.280 --> 00:00:32.860
First of all, there should be
a tag that we're going to use for

00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:36.280
logging events and
a constructor for the class.

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:39.380
Here's the tag I'm setting up,
I'm just calling it detection is,

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:43.000
where is stands for intends service and
here's the constructor, and

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.020
all I'm just going to do with
the constructor is super the tag.

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:48.720
There's one more thing that I need
to do, and that is because this is

00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:53.000
an intent service, I have to get it
to extend the IntentService class.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:53.840
And we do that right here.

00:00:54.980 --> 00:00:57.080
Because I've pasted IntentService in,

00:00:57.080 --> 00:01:00.430
and Android Studio recognized
that I haven't imported that yet,

00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:03.410
It's asking me if I want to import it,
and yes of course, I do.

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:05.300
You may notice that I have
a red under line here, and

00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:08.300
that's because I haven't implemented
on the on handle intent yet.

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:11.140
And if you remember earlier,
we mentioned that you have to implement

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:15.340
that, and you pass the desired intent
to that, so we will do that next.
