1
00:00:01,010 --> 00:00:01,710
Okay.

2
00:00:01,710 --> 00:00:04,680
Hey, what's going on? It's bill burn.
It's time for the Thursday afternoon.

3
00:00:04,681 --> 00:00:06,840
Just before Friday.
Monday morning podcast.

4
00:00:09,330 --> 00:00:10,110
Ah,

5
00:00:10,110 --> 00:00:11,410
I'm just checking in on you.

6
00:00:12,550 --> 00:00:17,500
I'm taking time out of my day to read
advertising to make a little more scratch,

7
00:00:17,650 --> 00:00:22,090
just to make sure that your
week is going okay. All right.

8
00:00:23,110 --> 00:00:27,480
That's all I'm trying to do here. Jesus
Christ's I hear one more fucking asshole.

9
00:00:27,490 --> 00:00:30,910
Bring up that stupid Michael
Jackson video. I don't know.

10
00:00:30,911 --> 00:00:32,650
What are they going to dig
them up and arrest them?

11
00:00:37,290 --> 00:00:37,620
Okay.

12
00:00:37,620 --> 00:00:40,950
You know and I, I love when anybody did
you see that thing on murder mountain?

13
00:00:41,190 --> 00:00:44,910
Did you see the making of a murderer?
And you go in there and you listen.

14
00:00:44,911 --> 00:00:49,490
You basically you are watching,
you're watching the prosecution's case.

15
00:00:49,491 --> 00:00:53,300
That's not how a case works. Then
you had the defense. All right.

16
00:00:54,230 --> 00:00:57,290
And I think it's kind of fucked up that
you can have something come out about a

17
00:00:57,291 --> 00:00:59,570
dead guy and then everybody's
just going to be like, all right,

18
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:01,420
now we know definitively that this guy,

19
00:01:01,740 --> 00:01:06,410
he should be allowed to refute
moonwalk out of the grave and be like,

20
00:01:06,910 --> 00:01:07,743
listen,

21
00:01:07,790 --> 00:01:11,050
just because I talk like this and I
like castles and have a giant ice cream

22
00:01:11,051 --> 00:01:13,150
machine in like 17 doors,

23
00:01:13,151 --> 00:01:16,570
that lock or the weight in my
bedroom doesn't even fucking a child.

24
00:01:16,690 --> 00:01:18,280
He should be able to say that

25
00:01:20,590 --> 00:01:25,270
and that because I think he's innocent
a, it's, it's for you and me. Right?

26
00:01:25,540 --> 00:01:29,380
So we get the chance to do that. So some
day, you know, somebody can't just say,

27
00:01:29,381 --> 00:01:29,621
Hey,

28
00:01:29,621 --> 00:01:33,880
I saw this guy with this tally whacker
fucking wagon out of the zipper there.

29
00:01:34,180 --> 00:01:34,500
Right?

30
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:39,100
You have a chance to defend yourself and
what this new fucking bullshit of the

31
00:01:39,101 --> 00:01:42,700
Internet where they just all do
processes thrown out the fucking window.

32
00:01:43,690 --> 00:01:46,360
The amount of people that I've
seen accused of this me too, Shit.

33
00:01:46,361 --> 00:01:49,390
And then people just immediately go.
Like I always knew he was at Pz Shit.

34
00:01:49,420 --> 00:01:52,840
It's just like you haven't heard,
you've, you've heard an accusation.

35
00:01:53,410 --> 00:01:57,670
But having said that,
having said that,

36
00:01:57,730 --> 00:02:02,140
it makes me feel better about
the suffering of humanity, right?

37
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:03,850
Cause when you look at
human being suffering,

38
00:02:03,851 --> 00:02:06,730
if you're any sort of a human
being, it bothers you. All right?

39
00:02:06,731 --> 00:02:10,290
But when you see 90% of them on the
Internet going, N***a, you, that guy,

40
00:02:10,291 --> 00:02:12,930
will you be you? Yet at that point
you're like, well maybe I baby,

41
00:02:12,990 --> 00:02:14,190
maybe they don't need that much food.

42
00:02:17,950 --> 00:02:21,340
Oh that was just me, Bill, that
was to meet for the morning.

43
00:02:21,341 --> 00:02:24,340
I am a little bit of a
disappointing morning.

44
00:02:24,341 --> 00:02:27,970
I was going to go fly a helicopter and we
couldn't get the fucking thing started.

45
00:02:29,150 --> 00:02:30,730
This our 22 I don't know what the deal is.

46
00:02:30,731 --> 00:02:33,940
Like if you try to start it before eight,
the magnetos are too cold,

47
00:02:33,941 --> 00:02:37,150
it's too cold outside this time of
year and it just doesn't want to start.

48
00:02:37,450 --> 00:02:39,790
So we've,
we brought a car up to jump in,

49
00:02:39,880 --> 00:02:43,030
which we'd done before and it has
been fine. It looks funny as hell.

50
00:02:43,031 --> 00:02:48,031
But if you just don't look at the fact
that it's a car and it's a helicopter and

51
00:02:48,641 --> 00:02:50,050
you just look at the
engine and you're like, oh,

52
00:02:50,051 --> 00:02:52,870
it's the same fucking so fucking
gas combustion engine. All right.

53
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:55,620
Same fucking principles here.
Um,

54
00:02:55,720 --> 00:02:58,870
I was really looking forward to flying
and I know what a lot of you guys are

55
00:02:58,871 --> 00:03:00,300
saying like, oh my God, I know why.

56
00:03:00,340 --> 00:03:04,480
There's no fucking way I want to floats
up that I had invited y'all shot. I know,

57
00:03:04,570 --> 00:03:07,390
I know what you'll get in your car that
fucking every time you drive over a

58
00:03:07,391 --> 00:03:09,730
puddle at fucking Jesus in your face,
right?

59
00:03:09,790 --> 00:03:12,430
Coming up through the rusted out
floorboards as you're texting,

60
00:03:12,431 --> 00:03:15,340
driving 90 miles an hour
right down the fucking street.

61
00:03:15,430 --> 00:03:20,080
We'll say 50 drive and 50 looking down
at your fucking phone and there's no

62
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:23,050
guardrail and there's somebody
driving 50 miles an hour, just one,

63
00:03:23,290 --> 00:03:25,930
not even like three feet up.
You.

64
00:03:25,931 --> 00:03:27,940
Have you ever noticed that when
you drive down the fucking street,

65
00:03:28,900 --> 00:03:30,250
just on a two way street,

66
00:03:30,730 --> 00:03:34,480
like the fact that you're going 50 and
the other guys going 50 and it never

67
00:03:34,481 --> 00:03:36,910
dawns on you like, what is that
guy just fucking swerved over.

68
00:03:36,911 --> 00:03:40,340
We'd both be fucking dead.
It's like you're doing like what the,

69
00:03:40,510 --> 00:03:43,000
the blue angels fly at each other.
The last second they turn away.

70
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:44,920
You're doing that with complete strangers.

71
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:47,920
You're not on the radio talking
to each other and every day,

72
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:51,810
every day somebody on their fucking phone,
they drift over headlight,

73
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:53,530
the front headlight,
Bam.

74
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:56,770
Right brain smashing on the inside
of the skull or what do people say?

75
00:03:57,130 --> 00:04:01,750
What do people say? Oh my God,
it's a fucking shape. That's it.

76
00:04:02,140 --> 00:04:05,290
But the next time you go to get in a
car and nobody says like, Hey, I'll go,

77
00:04:06,130 --> 00:04:10,390
maybe you should walk. You're
going to fucking die. Sorry.

78
00:04:10,391 --> 00:04:12,910
I'm trying to preempt everybody
who's going to sit there and fucking

79
00:04:15,010 --> 00:04:18,100
say a bunch of fucking shit
here. Anyways, plowing ahead.

80
00:04:18,101 --> 00:04:22,450
Guess who finally figured out how the
Moto GP website works. Not this guy.

81
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:25,480
Somebody gave me the Lincoln show me and
then I was able to put in my password

82
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:27,100
and a so thank you to the,

83
00:04:27,130 --> 00:04:30,220
to the listener who helped me
out and I got to watch that race.

84
00:04:30,580 --> 00:04:35,290
The first one of the Aaron [inaudible]
or a, what do they call k Tar?

85
00:04:36,790 --> 00:04:37,690
The English guys?

86
00:04:38,760 --> 00:04:38,980
Yeah,

87
00:04:38,980 --> 00:04:41,140
like every little fucking word
they say different than us.

88
00:04:41,141 --> 00:04:45,070
It's amazing that we speak the same
language over here. We say Ducati,

89
00:04:45,071 --> 00:04:49,000
they see do catty Oregano or a Ghana,
tomato,

90
00:04:49,001 --> 00:04:52,220
tomato, Qatar, Qatar.

91
00:04:53,850 --> 00:04:58,390
I didn't know that the scene or Qatar,
Qatar is, they think God was saying it.

92
00:04:59,890 --> 00:05:02,590
Um, I don't know when I just
hear shit like that. I really,

93
00:05:02,710 --> 00:05:06,790
and to start to understand how difficult
it is to be a spy, because that's,

94
00:05:06,791 --> 00:05:11,690
that's the shit that gets you caught.
You get the accent down, you know,

95
00:05:11,691 --> 00:05:15,050
you watch a little peaky blinders and
you go over there and next thing you know

96
00:05:15,051 --> 00:05:18,920
you're in Buckingham Palace and you
fucking snooping around to find out what

97
00:05:18,921 --> 00:05:22,160
those balding concert doing in there
with all the goddamn money. Right.

98
00:05:22,430 --> 00:05:26,830
And then all of a sudden, what do you
do? You let it do, you got, uh, uh, Duke,

99
00:05:27,020 --> 00:05:31,460
a Ducati. Forgot how he said it.
A Ducati slip, then that's it,

100
00:05:31,940 --> 00:05:33,380
right?
The queen pushes a button.

101
00:05:33,381 --> 00:05:37,040
You go through the floor right
down to the royal alligators. Um,

102
00:05:38,090 --> 00:05:38,660
yeah,

103
00:05:38,660 --> 00:05:40,260
there's the, I'm gonna tell
you right now, but motor GP,

104
00:05:40,290 --> 00:05:45,230
this is the best fucking racing
that is out there. All right.

105
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:49,100
On the final lap, the two, the two people,

106
00:05:50,550 --> 00:05:54,320
Andres Divisio so, and Mark Marquez in
first and second place, they change leads.

107
00:05:54,380 --> 00:05:57,140
The delayed changed three
times in the final fucking,

108
00:05:58,730 --> 00:06:01,790
even though I knew it would happen, I
was still up off the couch, you know,

109
00:06:01,791 --> 00:06:06,390
everybody was asleep. So I was
screaming quietly watching it. Um,

110
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:11,360
and amazing race. Uh, a little
bit of controversy though. Huh?

111
00:06:12,450 --> 00:06:16,400
Do Ducati's the Ducati's they got
this new little piece that they have

112
00:06:16,670 --> 00:06:19,130
underneath the bike that uh,

113
00:06:19,131 --> 00:06:22,730
allegedly is kicking up air to cool
off the rear tire. And these guys,

114
00:06:22,731 --> 00:06:24,650
I guess they chew up their tires big time.

115
00:06:25,190 --> 00:06:28,470
So if he has this little bit
of an advantage, so Davitt CEO.

116
00:06:28,840 --> 00:06:32,060
So one Ducati, one, uh,

117
00:06:32,090 --> 00:06:35,480
the team and immediately
four teams complaint,

118
00:06:35,510 --> 00:06:39,470
which I'm guessing is Honda Suzuki.
Uh,

119
00:06:40,220 --> 00:06:43,850
by the way, how come there's no Harleys
are fucking Indians in the Goddamn race?

120
00:06:43,970 --> 00:06:45,080
Well, what happened? My country,

121
00:06:46,730 --> 00:06:50,840
we started making fucking motorcycles
before all of these constantly.

122
00:06:51,890 --> 00:06:56,380
I gotta look this up.
It's so funny that like,

123
00:06:56,410 --> 00:07:00,430
Indians in like Honda's, it just for
like fat fucks, not Honda's Harleys.

124
00:07:00,700 --> 00:07:03,940
Essentially.
It's for old guys want to sit down.

125
00:07:03,941 --> 00:07:08,650
I like the pegs up nice and
highs my fucking air up my
old fucking ball bag as I

126
00:07:08,651 --> 00:07:13,630
drive down the fucking street and all
the Japanese bikes and the Italian bikes,

127
00:07:13,631 --> 00:07:16,660
they're all for the young guys who
think they're gonna live forever. Right?

128
00:07:17,080 --> 00:07:20,380
Having said all this, having
talked to all this shit, you know,

129
00:07:20,381 --> 00:07:24,370
if I was going to get a bike,
which I would love to, um,

130
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:29,080
if I wasn't, you know, live in for
somebody else now, but even then,

131
00:07:29,110 --> 00:07:32,170
even before he had a kid,
like, I always liked my legs.

132
00:07:37,900 --> 00:07:41,170
Um, I like my feet pointing
in the direction they're
supposed to be rather than

133
00:07:41,171 --> 00:07:45,460
turned around like I'm fucking like
daffy duck's bill. Every other cartoon.

134
00:07:46,840 --> 00:07:48,610
Um, all right. What the
hell was I looking up?

135
00:07:49,860 --> 00:07:50,500
Oh,

136
00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:55,310
first motorcycle built. All right,

137
00:07:55,311 --> 00:08:00,260
let's see who built it first.
Oh, I got the bad internet.

138
00:08:00,380 --> 00:08:04,670
Huh? Sometimes you get the bad cocaine.
Sometimes you get the bad internet.

139
00:08:05,900 --> 00:08:10,220
What the fuck are you doing here?
Can I only white one first?

140
00:08:11,130 --> 00:08:11,820
Okay.

141
00:08:11,820 --> 00:08:16,820
Fucking motorcycle ever built.

142
00:08:17,960 --> 00:08:18,990
That's going to bring a porno of,

143
00:08:21,790 --> 00:08:25,470
as I said, fucking in it. Come on,
come on. You can load. You can,

144
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:29,140
you can load if you want to.
You can answer my fucking question.

145
00:08:31,940 --> 00:08:36,740
What is the AH, Jesus fucking
Christ. How much do you have to pay?

146
00:08:37,790 --> 00:08:40,940
How much I am fucking pay nine grand
a month for fucking write the first

147
00:08:40,941 --> 00:08:45,941
motorcycle international
combustion petroleum field
motorcycle was was the damn.

148
00:08:46,371 --> 00:08:48,620
You're right.
Vogle that sounds like German.

149
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:52,800
It was designed and built
by the German inventors. Ah,

150
00:08:52,910 --> 00:08:53,930
you fucking son's up.

151
00:08:53,931 --> 00:08:57,090
Is there anything worse than when you
think a man did something or America did

152
00:08:57,091 --> 00:09:00,090
it and you find out
they didn't still worst?

153
00:09:00,091 --> 00:09:01,950
I feel like the world's
smiles when that happens.

154
00:09:02,190 --> 00:09:06,810
A motorcycle often called a
bike or a motorbike or a cycle.

155
00:09:06,990 --> 00:09:09,540
I know what that is. Okay. 1,894

156
00:09:12,090 --> 00:09:17,090
Hildebrand and Wolf Mueller became the
first series production motorcycles and

157
00:09:17,141 --> 00:09:22,030
the first to be called a motorcycle in
2014 the three top motorcycle producers

158
00:09:22,031 --> 00:09:24,670
globally by volume or Honda?
Yamaha

159
00:09:26,450 --> 00:09:29,900
and the hero motor corps. I
don't know. It's in India.

160
00:09:31,050 --> 00:09:31,410
Okay.

161
00:09:31,410 --> 00:09:34,520
All right. So we're not the only ones
making motorcycles. Then on in Moto GP.

162
00:09:36,820 --> 00:09:39,970
What is it about like Italians in,
in uh,

163
00:09:40,030 --> 00:09:43,810
Japanese motorcycles that they just
make the fastest ones they got,

164
00:09:43,811 --> 00:09:48,490
they got that on lock down and look
at fucking, um, Japan. They got Honda,

165
00:09:48,520 --> 00:09:50,050
Suzuki and Yamaha.

166
00:09:50,290 --> 00:09:54,370
So what I'm finding out is this
Suzuki's of the best in the corners,

167
00:09:54,520 --> 00:09:57,760
but then the Ducati's and Honda's just
have too many horses when they go down

168
00:09:57,761 --> 00:10:01,220
the straightaway, which is
fucking weird to me. You know,

169
00:10:01,221 --> 00:10:04,430
I guess it would depend on the track
because the one they were riding riding on

170
00:10:04,580 --> 00:10:09,220
head like two long straightaways so when
he sort of fucking ground the dude and

171
00:10:09,221 --> 00:10:10,250
the Suzuki would gain,

172
00:10:10,251 --> 00:10:13,790
he would just lose it every time you
would go by the grand stairs over there.

173
00:10:13,910 --> 00:10:16,470
All right. Enough motorcycle
talk. But I really enjoyed it. Uh,

174
00:10:16,710 --> 00:10:19,550
if you want to jump on board,
there's only like 20 fucking racist.

175
00:10:20,090 --> 00:10:22,640
They're like 22,
2124 laps.

176
00:10:22,641 --> 00:10:27,410
They fly by and you're watching guys
going 200 fucking miles an hour on a

177
00:10:27,411 --> 00:10:31,520
motorcycle, like an eighth of an
inch away from each other. It's done.

178
00:10:31,940 --> 00:10:34,280
I'll tell you,
it's unfucking believable.

179
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:39,500
I've been given Yannis Pappas Shit.
One of my favorite comics out there.

180
00:10:39,501 --> 00:10:40,580
Absolutely brilliant guy.

181
00:10:40,581 --> 00:10:45,581
But he's like the classic fucking New
Yorker where he did this Instagram post,

182
00:10:46,010 --> 00:10:48,230
right?
And uh,

183
00:10:49,280 --> 00:10:49,690
yeah,

184
00:10:49,690 --> 00:10:51,850
he's like in Philadelphia and he goes,
look at these,

185
00:10:51,910 --> 00:10:55,600
these go and look at the buildings, look
at buildings, buildings. And he goes,

186
00:10:55,601 --> 00:10:59,200
every city looks like New New
York City for a block and a half.

187
00:10:59,230 --> 00:11:03,630
And then the whole thing falls
apart. You know? And I this,

188
00:11:03,640 --> 00:11:07,000
there's something just so fucking
funny about the way New Yorkers travel.

189
00:11:08,100 --> 00:11:08,450
Yeah.

190
00:11:08,450 --> 00:11:10,280
You know,
every place they go to,

191
00:11:10,281 --> 00:11:13,490
if they can't do exactly what the
fuck they can do in New York City,

192
00:11:13,491 --> 00:11:16,160
the place sucks.
It's like you're in Philadelphia.

193
00:11:17,240 --> 00:11:21,950
Why would it look like New York
City? That's why you travel. Oh,

194
00:11:21,951 --> 00:11:24,320
where are all the fuck you'd build thing?

195
00:11:29,240 --> 00:11:34,240
The tristate area is arguably the biggest
collection of meatheads in the United

196
00:11:36,380 --> 00:11:36,831
States of America.
And I,

197
00:11:36,831 --> 00:11:40,370
and this is saying something cause I
grew up in Greater Boston, you know,

198
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:42,070
and if you want to see
the level of meat had,

199
00:11:42,080 --> 00:11:45,200
just watch a Boston sporting event
when they pay into the crowd.

200
00:11:46,690 --> 00:11:47,310
Okay.

201
00:11:47,310 --> 00:11:49,960
All right. And I'm not talking down.
I know I'm part of the problem.

202
00:11:51,660 --> 00:11:52,040
Yeah.

203
00:11:52,040 --> 00:11:54,310
So I've just been leaving
all these fucking messages.

204
00:11:54,910 --> 00:11:59,330
How New Yorkers just think everything
sucks. This such fucking moron. Oh,

205
00:11:59,340 --> 00:12:02,580
I went to fucking used it.
Right. I mean Houston, Texas.

206
00:12:02,581 --> 00:12:06,480
So I ordered the linguine and the
fuck else. You fucking terrible.

207
00:12:07,070 --> 00:12:07,870
Yeah.

208
00:12:07,870 --> 00:12:11,320
Okay. Good. Good Italian. And use the
Texas. Why didn't you get the barbecue?

209
00:12:11,321 --> 00:12:12,250
You dumb.
Fuck.

210
00:12:13,170 --> 00:12:13,290
Okay.

211
00:12:13,290 --> 00:12:14,730
Why don't you get some Tex Mex

212
00:12:17,710 --> 00:12:19,990
[inaudible] I went to buffalo,
right.

213
00:12:20,050 --> 00:12:24,790
I fucking went to the buffalo wild
wings and fucking wigs. I tag good

214
00:12:26,310 --> 00:12:30,780
fucking morons. They are fucking
morons. It, you know what's funny?

215
00:12:30,781 --> 00:12:34,320
I um, I went to the Brody
Memorial, right? I can't remember.

216
00:12:34,321 --> 00:12:38,720
I talked about this on Monday.
I still can't get over this.

217
00:12:38,721 --> 00:12:43,610
This guy was eulogizing is that
the right word? Brody Stevens.

218
00:12:43,640 --> 00:12:47,630
And he somehow was able
to trash Boston twice.

219
00:12:49,670 --> 00:12:53,750
It is fucking eulogy. It was one of the
high points of it cause it was, you know,

220
00:12:53,751 --> 00:12:55,370
it was really uplifting,
but it was sad.

221
00:12:55,820 --> 00:12:59,750
But it was kind of funny to see that New
York fans are that fucking annoyed that

222
00:12:59,751 --> 00:13:01,880
we won some championships finally,

223
00:13:03,530 --> 00:13:04,363
you know,

224
00:13:05,390 --> 00:13:07,180
finally won a couple, you know, and that,

225
00:13:07,410 --> 00:13:10,820
that it's bothering them so much that
they're now reduced to making fun of our

226
00:13:10,821 --> 00:13:11,654
skyline.

227
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:13,690
Uh,

228
00:13:13,690 --> 00:13:17,350
and that's stupid shit that ESPN came
up with where they would like say that

229
00:13:17,351 --> 00:13:21,220
Boston had an inferiority complex is one
of my favorite with New York is one of

230
00:13:21,221 --> 00:13:24,160
my favorite thing ever. I don't have
the heart to tell New York is that like,

231
00:13:25,090 --> 00:13:26,650
yeah, we don't even, we
didn't even know that.

232
00:13:26,680 --> 00:13:28,120
We didn't know what the
fuck it looked like.

233
00:13:32,310 --> 00:13:36,640
He'd given us too much
credit. Um, I want to say,

234
00:13:36,641 --> 00:13:39,550
I already talked about this on Monday,
but you know,

235
00:13:39,551 --> 00:13:42,400
like whenever they
fucking show New England,

236
00:13:42,401 --> 00:13:43,870
whenever there's a game in New England,

237
00:13:44,260 --> 00:13:47,480
they're always showing
some sort of foliage. Uh,

238
00:13:47,530 --> 00:13:51,340
something about the revolutionary war
and then somebody is eating a fucking

239
00:13:51,840 --> 00:13:55,450
oyster is something and it's just like,
that's really, that's, that's not a good,

240
00:13:57,280 --> 00:13:59,350
uh, that's not a good indication
of what's going on. Yeah,

241
00:13:59,570 --> 00:14:00,403
yeah,

242
00:14:04,350 --> 00:14:07,790
yeah. So somebody in a dive bar with a
beer and a fucking shot that, yeah, maybe,

243
00:14:07,980 --> 00:14:10,090
and don't,
don't go to the bull and finch,

244
00:14:10,091 --> 00:14:14,320
that stupid fucking cheers thing or
whatever the hell it is. Um, anyways,

245
00:14:14,770 --> 00:14:18,640
having said that to all the New York is
listening, I absolutely love your city.

246
00:14:18,730 --> 00:14:21,130
I love the people. I just don't
like the Yankees. That's it.

247
00:14:21,160 --> 00:14:24,640
Everything else about it.
I absolutely love having said that.

248
00:14:24,641 --> 00:14:27,750
I love Philadelphia too.
I enjoy Washington DC.

249
00:14:28,550 --> 00:14:30,760
Milwaukee is one of my favorite cities.
I don't fucking,

250
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:33,910
cause when I go there I don't
try to get fuck it. Don't,

251
00:14:34,090 --> 00:14:38,510
let's get some fucking killer fucking
clam chowder is shocked in Green Bay job.

252
00:14:41,330 --> 00:14:42,163
MMM

253
00:14:45,090 --> 00:14:48,990
Dude. I, I fought in, I go, I go
to fucking Argentina. Right dude,

254
00:14:48,991 --> 00:14:52,910
I'm fucking down yet. And I, and I say
to guy, can I get a fucking Sam Adams?

255
00:14:53,660 --> 00:14:55,550
[inaudible] got an email
she had no Sam Adams.

256
00:14:58,090 --> 00:14:58,530
Yeah.

257
00:14:58,530 --> 00:15:00,450
So I told this fucking place sucks.

258
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:04,593
MMM.

259
00:15:04,900 --> 00:15:06,680
Did anybody else,
do you have any stories like that?

260
00:15:06,710 --> 00:15:09,740
I shouldn't really just blame New Yorkers,
but does anybody else have like,

261
00:15:10,040 --> 00:15:12,380
cause I think country people are like
that too, where they just kind of look

262
00:15:12,870 --> 00:15:16,820
to [inaudible] y'all deal. There's
all these broken people out here, man.

263
00:15:17,060 --> 00:15:20,660
You give me the wild open
spices mile property.

264
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:25,680
Get me a four wheeler and a good woman
who does now the self esteem to walk off.

265
00:15:26,110 --> 00:15:30,440
Right. She knows I'll fucking club or
over the head and feed her to my pigs.

266
00:15:30,650 --> 00:15:33,830
I've done it before.
She knows it.

267
00:15:35,150 --> 00:15:36,230
We never talk about it.

268
00:15:36,231 --> 00:15:38,900
But she knows that she goes out
when she goes to feed the pig.

269
00:15:39,170 --> 00:15:42,920
She sees a couple of thugs hanging
on a nail. She knows what that means.

270
00:15:43,610 --> 00:15:46,280
I told her I've been married
twice before she gets it.

271
00:15:48,060 --> 00:15:48,590
MMM.

272
00:15:48,590 --> 00:15:52,280
Yeah. People, the purpose of traveling
is, is, is the when in Rome, right?

273
00:15:53,150 --> 00:15:56,120
When in Rome do as the Romans do.
That's what you do. All right.

274
00:15:56,150 --> 00:16:00,740
You fucking go over there. Do you go over
to fucking, you know, uh, the UK, right?

275
00:16:01,430 --> 00:16:01,641
Premiere League.
See,

276
00:16:01,641 --> 00:16:05,420
get yourself a fucking pint in a
scarf and start singing some socks.

277
00:16:06,260 --> 00:16:07,093
All right.

278
00:16:07,940 --> 00:16:08,773
Okay.

279
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:10,060
You know,
pull a very busy,

280
00:16:10,110 --> 00:16:14,700
like an in a study and you talked to some
90 year old woman over there, you know,

281
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:17,550
in blazing fast English. Go in like, Hey,

282
00:16:17,551 --> 00:16:20,370
do you know where we can watch
the NFL divisional round playoffs?

283
00:16:25,450 --> 00:16:25,980
Yeah.

284
00:16:25,980 --> 00:16:27,980
You know what it is? I think
about New Yorkers, they've just,

285
00:16:27,981 --> 00:16:31,760
they've just some too many fucking
songs about your city and then all these

286
00:16:31,761 --> 00:16:33,980
meatheads who really didn't
do that well in school,

287
00:16:34,010 --> 00:16:37,250
they think they're part of the success
rather than the digits background in the

288
00:16:37,251 --> 00:16:41,030
movie. Um, as I've always said,
Frank Sinatra was bridging

289
00:16:41,090 --> 00:16:43,030
tunnel.
He was a Jersey guy,

290
00:16:44,590 --> 00:16:48,190
four x, and he lives in nowhere. There's
no buildings and fucking place sucks.

291
00:16:49,210 --> 00:16:50,043
Yeah.

292
00:16:50,190 --> 00:16:54,480
Um, alright. Plowing ahead here. Uh,

293
00:16:54,810 --> 00:16:58,530
I did some stand up the other night,
first time since Royal Albert Hall.

294
00:16:59,490 --> 00:17:04,230
I had a good time trying out new shit.
Just like, just nothing. I got nothing.

295
00:17:04,231 --> 00:17:09,060
So I'm going to go down to the comedy
store possibly this weekend. Well,

296
00:17:09,061 --> 00:17:11,820
maybe not this week and maybe next
weekend and I'm just gonna fucking,

297
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:16,840
I'm just going to do
20 minutes of new shit.

298
00:17:17,620 --> 00:17:19,480
I'm just going to have like four or five,

299
00:17:19,481 --> 00:17:23,860
six subjects written down and I'm going
on stage and I'm just going to stand

300
00:17:23,861 --> 00:17:26,170
there and fucking take it.
Um,

301
00:17:26,200 --> 00:17:29,860
and it's one of my favorite
things in the world to do. Um,

302
00:17:29,950 --> 00:17:31,750
I was just listening to Brody special,

303
00:17:32,230 --> 00:17:36,130
the one that he has on fucking
iTunes and uh, I just, I don't know,

304
00:17:36,730 --> 00:17:41,440
just listening to that guy plowing through
this, just one of my favorite things.

305
00:17:41,441 --> 00:17:45,520
Definitely gonna miss that guy. Um, but
it was an incredible memorial service,

306
00:17:45,521 --> 00:17:48,520
which I really would think that I talked
about it on Monday. I believe I did.

307
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:52,860
I just kept no fucking short term memory.
So anyways,

308
00:17:53,070 --> 00:17:54,870
Hayden was funny was
right before I started,

309
00:17:54,871 --> 00:17:58,050
I asked my wife if she could just go
talk in the other room because she was

310
00:17:58,051 --> 00:18:02,510
talking, she had a phone on speaker
and you know, I'm just recording.

311
00:18:02,530 --> 00:18:04,710
Just didn't want that shit in
the background at all. My God,

312
00:18:04,711 --> 00:18:09,430
the fucking look she gave
me. It's unbelief. Anal.

313
00:18:11,790 --> 00:18:14,370
She's asking me to do shit all
the fucking time. Can you go here?

314
00:18:14,371 --> 00:18:17,490
Can you pick up this? Can you do
this? Can you do that? I'll ask to do,

315
00:18:17,540 --> 00:18:20,310
it was just move down one room,
close the door.

316
00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:24,480
She just looked at me cause I know what
she's going to say. You fucking talk.

317
00:18:24,730 --> 00:18:29,390
So fucking lad. When you then effecting
third get get the [inaudible],

318
00:18:29,430 --> 00:18:31,700
you know it's always, it always
comes back. Always come back.

319
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:33,840
Hey de Rosa sent me some,

320
00:18:33,900 --> 00:18:37,020
I guess they got this new fucking
Charlie Manson movie that's coming out,

321
00:18:37,350 --> 00:18:42,150
whether they're trying to make the women
that Charlie convinced to kill those

322
00:18:42,151 --> 00:18:43,260
people.
Victims.

323
00:18:48,990 --> 00:18:49,500
Okay,

324
00:18:49,500 --> 00:18:52,140
I don't give a fuck if
you're a victim or not.

325
00:18:52,230 --> 00:18:56,490
If you are dumb enough that you let
some fucking psycho look in Jesus,

326
00:18:56,840 --> 00:19:00,180
talk you into murdering a pregnant
woman and then trying to cut the

327
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:04,590
baby out. Yeah, you shouldn't
be walking around in society.

328
00:19:06,550 --> 00:19:07,990
This is the new fucking thing.

329
00:19:08,410 --> 00:19:13,040
The new fucking thing now is to go back
in time and find a bunch of selfish cons

330
00:19:13,060 --> 00:19:14,830
and then somehow blame it on guys.

331
00:19:14,831 --> 00:19:18,940
And in order to started with it
started with that stupid movie monster.

332
00:19:20,340 --> 00:19:20,530
Yeah.

333
00:19:20,530 --> 00:19:23,950
Well that fucking loan at tech was a
serial killer and I'm watching the movie

334
00:19:23,951 --> 00:19:27,280
and they're trying to make me feel guilty.
Like I'm, I'm, I'm part of the problem.

335
00:19:27,281 --> 00:19:30,430
I'm the reason why she became one.
I saw the Jeffrey Dahmer movie.

336
00:19:30,431 --> 00:19:31,690
They didn't do that.
They just like,

337
00:19:31,691 --> 00:19:33,610
this guy's out of his fucking
mind and he's eaten people.

338
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:40,170
Um, I don't know, but it's a
woman. There has to be a reason.

339
00:19:41,610 --> 00:19:45,300
Maybe she just came out of the womb
a complete fucking psycho. Right?

340
00:19:45,540 --> 00:19:47,100
Maybe that's what it was.
I don't fucking know.

341
00:19:48,360 --> 00:19:53,220
I think they tried to like find some
sort of trajectory in the madness of

342
00:19:53,221 --> 00:19:57,090
Jeffrey Dahmer, but at no
point did they blame women. Um,

343
00:19:57,420 --> 00:19:59,450
although in fairness to though

344
00:20:02,140 --> 00:20:03,280
they,
um,

345
00:20:04,910 --> 00:20:05,570
okay.

346
00:20:05,570 --> 00:20:09,940
Who's that guy? That Ed Game Guy,
that guy from fucking Wisconsin. Um,

347
00:20:09,980 --> 00:20:14,030
they did try to s they did say that his
mother fucked him up. So I don't know.

348
00:20:14,031 --> 00:20:16,400
Maybe I'm just being a baby,
you know,

349
00:20:16,401 --> 00:20:19,880
maybe I should have moved
to a one room over. Is that,

350
00:20:19,881 --> 00:20:23,390
is that what I should've done?
Um, all right. So as I mentioned,

351
00:20:23,391 --> 00:20:27,740
the Bruins lost two in a row, two in a
row, hoping to get back on track here.

352
00:20:28,610 --> 00:20:33,170
Um, I'm going to the fucking Gad and
dreams April 2nd, everybody. April 2nd.

353
00:20:33,590 --> 00:20:37,370
I'm doing the garden of dreams with,
uh,

354
00:20:38,750 --> 00:20:39,583
John Stewart.

355
00:20:39,710 --> 00:20:43,220
Oh, this is in New York City by the way.
Oh my God. They read is unbelievable.

356
00:20:43,221 --> 00:20:45,830
It's so much nicer than a Rita's
another fucking shit. Cities

357
00:20:47,890 --> 00:20:52,440
I'm doing. It's Jerry Seinfeld. Jon
Stewart, Elijah Schlesinger. You're okay.

358
00:20:55,770 --> 00:20:56,050
Uh,

359
00:20:56,050 --> 00:20:58,720
who else? Who else? Who
else? I forget who else.

360
00:20:58,750 --> 00:21:02,680
Those are the names that I remember.
Oh, and yours truly. How could I forget?

361
00:21:02,681 --> 00:21:06,280
Lovely mate.
Lovely baldy that embolding balled me.

362
00:21:07,750 --> 00:21:11,590
Um, that's the name of my one show.
One man show. Lovely balled me.

363
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:15,460
I've chosen me.

364
00:21:17,590 --> 00:21:22,590
I've decided to ignore all the advertising
did sing that I'm not good enough and

365
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:26,920
to say that I am good enough.

366
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:31,870
How fragile is your fucking psyche
that you fucking sit there looking at

367
00:21:31,871 --> 00:21:36,871
advertising and it fucks with you to that
level that you're walking out behind a

368
00:21:37,121 --> 00:21:42,121
fucking Papa John's throwing up into
a handicapped parking spot right now.

369
00:21:43,870 --> 00:21:44,980
I know what you think of bill.

370
00:21:45,730 --> 00:21:49,930
Why would you suggest that Papa John's
puts the handicap parking behind?

371
00:21:51,490 --> 00:21:53,950
I've never eaten it.
Papa John's. All right.

372
00:21:54,520 --> 00:21:55,353
Yeah,

373
00:21:56,010 --> 00:21:59,520
I like Papa Ginos Nice fucking Italian.

374
00:21:59,610 --> 00:22:03,030
I didn't want some guy named John
Making my goddamned pizza. All right.

375
00:22:03,960 --> 00:22:05,430
I want someone who can get a fucking tank.

376
00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:08,650
That's something that
Burns in fucking April. Um,

377
00:22:10,530 --> 00:22:12,390
what was I talking about?
The I've just, yeah, I mean,

378
00:22:12,391 --> 00:22:14,550
what the fuck is wrong with you?
First of all,

379
00:22:14,551 --> 00:22:18,480
the arrogance of you that you look at
a Victoria's secret model and you feel

380
00:22:18,481 --> 00:22:20,850
like you have to compete with that.
First of all,

381
00:22:20,851 --> 00:22:23,970
you can't any more than I
can compete with a Brad Pitt.

382
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,760
So what is the fucking problem?
And the second of all,

383
00:22:26,890 --> 00:22:29,370
when's the last time you saw a Victoria's
secret model walk into the bar that

384
00:22:29,371 --> 00:22:31,080
you're drinking at?
All right.

385
00:22:32,580 --> 00:22:35,610
You fucking regular looking person.

386
00:22:36,060 --> 00:22:38,610
You're an irregular looking person bar,

387
00:22:39,540 --> 00:22:44,010
you know with me and the second
and eight walks in the room,

388
00:22:44,011 --> 00:22:45,360
everybody fucking turns like,

389
00:22:45,361 --> 00:22:48,330
like Bo Derek just came
walking in and that movie 10

390
00:22:52,140 --> 00:22:56,820
Hollywood just create season.
Possible Standard. Yes. It's a movie.

391
00:23:03,480 --> 00:23:06,630
I don't understand. Like I like when
they do this reboot Buddha top gun.

392
00:23:06,631 --> 00:23:10,740
I'm not going to feel like I need to
learn how to fly a fucking fat to wherever

393
00:23:10,741 --> 00:23:13,860
the fuck they're flying. Was it f 19?
[inaudible] are they up to the 19?

394
00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:19,370
What are they up to now?
Let's see.

395
00:23:21,080 --> 00:23:21,110
Uh,

396
00:23:21,110 --> 00:23:26,110
you as a top fighter jet.

397
00:23:27,810 --> 00:23:29,120
All right.
What do we got here?

398
00:23:32,340 --> 00:23:36,090
Don't even fucking tell me. It's
called this the sue [inaudible] sue 57.

399
00:23:36,360 --> 00:23:38,610
Is it made in Japan?
Do we make anything here?

400
00:23:42,230 --> 00:23:42,740
Please tell me.

401
00:23:42,740 --> 00:23:46,190
An Asian American came up with that and
they make this an please for the love of

402
00:23:46,191 --> 00:23:49,060
God.
Do you guys have fucked up?

403
00:23:49,061 --> 00:23:52,960
That was if all our fighter jets are
made in Japan and then we have beef with

404
00:23:52,961 --> 00:23:55,910
them again and it's like,
hey man, can you keep making,

405
00:23:55,930 --> 00:23:59,440
making this jet so like we can get you
back for bombing the other part of Hawaii

406
00:23:59,470 --> 00:24:03,420
now, uh, top 10 best
fighter jets in the world.

407
00:24:03,450 --> 00:24:07,530
The top seven US fighter jets. I'll
come. They're not, not doing the, uh,

408
00:24:07,531 --> 00:24:12,300
the f anymore.
The JTTF 22.

409
00:24:14,200 --> 00:24:17,050
Dude, I'm so old. I remember,
I remember the [inaudible],

410
00:24:17,650 --> 00:24:22,650
they have 16 was the bump and I remember
a two 40 z before the two 80 z before

411
00:24:23,291 --> 00:24:26,230
the 300.
All right.

412
00:24:26,980 --> 00:24:29,350
I remember the f 100.
I don't,

413
00:24:30,510 --> 00:24:32,200
who's the F-150 in f two 50.

414
00:24:32,380 --> 00:24:37,380
I just needed another example was another
one where they just kept going up the

415
00:24:37,811 --> 00:24:40,090
Mazda rx seven.
What are they up to nine.

416
00:24:42,210 --> 00:24:44,130
I love how they think.
They say they don't start it.

417
00:24:44,550 --> 00:24:48,860
One like Jordan's like the sneakers,
you know, then was a Jordan twos,

418
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:53,640
Jordan threes. They started
like seven or a hundred.

419
00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:58,500
Um, if you wonder what the
fuck I'm talking about. I
don't, I don't know either.

420
00:24:59,050 --> 00:25:02,070
All right. I have no idea.
But anyways, I'm doing the gap

421
00:25:04,100 --> 00:25:08,390
dreams on, uh, April 2nd.

422
00:25:08,750 --> 00:25:12,550
It's in the, uh, it's the
theater at Madison Square Garden.

423
00:25:12,740 --> 00:25:16,130
As I mentioned on Monday, this is where
Eddie Murphy did, uh, the raw special.

424
00:25:16,131 --> 00:25:17,270
So I always think about that.

425
00:25:17,540 --> 00:25:21,860
So I will be there and I'm also the day
before I'm going to go try to go to a

426
00:25:21,861 --> 00:25:23,360
Brooklyn Nets game.
Now,

427
00:25:23,750 --> 00:25:27,440
I haven't gone to a pro game in a minute
as far as checking another one off the

428
00:25:27,441 --> 00:25:28,550
list and I'd forgotten.

429
00:25:28,910 --> 00:25:33,380
I only need like six more teams and I've
been to a home game of every protein in

430
00:25:33,381 --> 00:25:34,760
all four fucking sports.

431
00:25:35,300 --> 00:25:38,960
Now there's a very select few of you
that thinks that's awesome and that's who

432
00:25:38,961 --> 00:25:40,010
I'm talking to right now.

433
00:25:40,040 --> 00:25:43,880
The rest of you could just fucking zone
out because this part of the podcast,

434
00:25:43,881 --> 00:25:44,870
it's not about you

435
00:25:46,910 --> 00:25:49,450
any more than than an
average looking woman.

436
00:25:49,500 --> 00:25:53,470
It has to feel intimidated because you
know there's another Cindy Crawford

437
00:25:53,471 --> 00:25:54,220
coming along,

438
00:25:54,220 --> 00:25:58,030
her is now going to make a whole other
generation of people not feel pretty

439
00:25:58,031 --> 00:26:00,670
enough and I got to tell
you something there.

440
00:26:00,671 --> 00:26:05,380
There is a beauty in coming
to the realization that you,

441
00:26:05,381 --> 00:26:07,540
you aren't pretty enough.

442
00:26:08,650 --> 00:26:10,870
And just embracing that and
just being like, you know what?

443
00:26:10,871 --> 00:26:15,520
I'm going to be the coolest six
that walks into this bar tonight.

444
00:26:18,100 --> 00:26:21,760
It's all right being a sixth. Then
you just add add to it, you know,

445
00:26:23,110 --> 00:26:26,050
telecom, couple of jokes, learn how
to juggle. You know what I mean?

446
00:26:26,710 --> 00:26:28,480
It's like you ever see
somebody when they get a three,

447
00:26:28,481 --> 00:26:31,690
a Chrysler 300 and they try,
they try to make it look like a Bentley.

448
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:32,673
That's what you do.

449
00:26:33,970 --> 00:26:37,360
But at no point do you actually say that
you're a fucking Bentley or do you get

450
00:26:37,361 --> 00:26:42,090
mad that somebody is making a Bentley?
Is any of that makes sense?

451
00:26:42,091 --> 00:26:44,730
I don't fucking know.
Um,

452
00:26:44,790 --> 00:26:47,160
this is usually the point here
when I would read some advertising,

453
00:26:47,161 --> 00:26:49,320
but I didn't get any so far.
I wonder why.

454
00:26:49,380 --> 00:26:53,400
Probably because I shit on every
goddamn one of them. You know,

455
00:26:53,820 --> 00:26:58,740
and they fucking sensitive. Think these
women today have fucking sensitive.

456
00:26:58,810 --> 00:27:02,610
Do you think these millennials
get their feelings hurt? See,

457
00:27:02,611 --> 00:27:06,780
these fucking advertising companies
can't say a goddamn thing.

458
00:27:08,040 --> 00:27:08,873
Um,

459
00:27:08,930 --> 00:27:10,730
oh, I do have a read. Here we go.

479
00:28:16,910 --> 00:28:17,743
Okay.

480
00:28:19,330 --> 00:28:20,980
And it's now time to talk about,

481
00:28:22,210 --> 00:28:22,370
yeah,

482
00:28:22,370 --> 00:28:25,250
soccer,
I guess Liverpool,

483
00:28:25,280 --> 00:28:28,520
my adopted team is still down to
point to those men. City cuts.

484
00:28:29,990 --> 00:28:32,840
All right. What? Their, uh, wait, wait.

485
00:28:32,841 --> 00:28:37,640
Did they get their money from
somebody told me, God damn
it, it's not Saudi Arabia

486
00:28:40,200 --> 00:28:42,440
is it? You know, did they get it from air?

487
00:28:42,450 --> 00:28:44,880
Emirates does that when they
get it from the airline.

488
00:28:45,890 --> 00:28:46,560
Okay.

489
00:28:46,560 --> 00:28:50,790
Throw some of their first class fucking
ticket money at them. I don't remember.

490
00:28:53,320 --> 00:28:56,140
Anyways, they're down a point that
down a point and they've got a game.

491
00:28:56,170 --> 00:28:59,950
Liverpool's got a game on Monday.
They pay full M is, I would say,

492
00:28:59,951 --> 00:29:03,910
so they're probably full hand. Boom. You
go buy Bulla Wall on Saint Patty's Day.

493
00:29:05,020 --> 00:29:07,600
All Saint Paddy's Day you got to get out
there where you're green plastic cat.

494
00:29:08,310 --> 00:29:09,143
You know,

495
00:29:09,250 --> 00:29:11,500
where's my Hashtag on that
day where I get offended?

496
00:29:11,740 --> 00:29:14,860
Everybody going at agreed
alligator and allowing net goes,

497
00:29:15,890 --> 00:29:16,030
yeah,

498
00:29:16,030 --> 00:29:18,990
yeah. Everyone's getting shit for you.
Don't realize how fucked up that is.

499
00:29:19,110 --> 00:29:23,040
You know how funny it is?
Irish people are part Irish people.

500
00:29:23,580 --> 00:29:26,490
They go out and they just like,
there's no other fucking holiday.

501
00:29:27,830 --> 00:29:29,670
You know where people go out in,

502
00:29:30,050 --> 00:29:34,310
in people who are that nationality
literally go out and do the most

503
00:29:35,330 --> 00:29:39,230
like negative stereotype of themselves.
You know,

504
00:29:41,620 --> 00:29:45,490
black history month, everybody's
on their best behavior, right?

505
00:29:46,180 --> 00:29:50,920
Jewish holidays, everybody's
fucking Schilling. Saint
Patty's Day. What happens I,

506
00:29:50,921 --> 00:29:53,260
everybody goes out and gets
drunk in the fucking street.

507
00:29:53,261 --> 00:29:57,490
Dresses like a Leprechaun and passes
out in the gutter. That's what happens,

508
00:29:57,550 --> 00:30:01,300
right? Fucking corn, beef
sandwich. Fucking hanging out
of the side of your mouth.

509
00:30:03,690 --> 00:30:05,310
Well, that's what I always
hated about that holiday.

510
00:30:05,311 --> 00:30:09,870
It's like we're one of the prides of
the Irish is not only do you drink,

511
00:30:09,871 --> 00:30:14,070
you can handle your fucking liquor.
Don't, but don't. Can you guys just don't.

512
00:30:14,071 --> 00:30:18,840
Just don't make a messy yourself.
Fucking sitting there drinking green beer.

513
00:30:24,100 --> 00:30:26,320
The fuck are you doing?
Oh Shit.

514
00:30:27,310 --> 00:30:32,200
Odell Beckham Jr goes from the
giants to the Cleveland browns.

515
00:30:32,560 --> 00:30:37,560
Cleveland Brown fans beside themselves
can't believe their good fortune.

516
00:30:39,160 --> 00:30:42,160
Now they got out, they got that
kid there. What's his face there?

517
00:30:42,740 --> 00:30:47,710
They got the quarterback. I just spaced
on his name. Baker Mayfield, right?

518
00:30:48,820 --> 00:30:52,720
He's got a little bit of a swagger. He
likes talking a little bit of Shit, right?

519
00:30:52,721 --> 00:30:55,840
He likes doing something
and doing a little dance in
front of the fucking crowd.

520
00:30:56,050 --> 00:31:00,810
Now he's got a wide
receiver. Right. So what's,

521
00:31:01,160 --> 00:31:05,180
this might work if they have like an
Al Davis old school sort of thing.

522
00:31:05,181 --> 00:31:07,700
Because this reminds me of
what the Raiders used to do,

523
00:31:07,880 --> 00:31:10,640
where they would take the fucking people.
Everybody said don't take,

524
00:31:10,730 --> 00:31:13,700
are the outcasts from other teams.
And then they would go in there.

525
00:31:14,510 --> 00:31:17,120
Everybody would just be themselves
and they would have a good time.

526
00:31:19,530 --> 00:31:24,300
I hope it works out for the browns. My
Gut says, I can't say that it won't.

527
00:31:25,170 --> 00:31:28,830
It just all depends on the coach.
The personality.

528
00:31:29,970 --> 00:31:34,200
Like that's a good rex Ryan team.
Cause then he's talking shit. Oh,

529
00:31:34,560 --> 00:31:38,250
Dell's talking shit. Baker's
doing what the fuck he does. Uh,

530
00:31:38,251 --> 00:31:40,340
but it's definitely going to be exciting.
But I actually think,

531
00:31:40,410 --> 00:31:42,750
I think it was a good move for the giants.

532
00:31:43,680 --> 00:31:45,500
He didn't kind of fit into their,

533
00:31:46,280 --> 00:31:50,340
they have vibe defensive
minded organization.

534
00:31:51,430 --> 00:31:55,170
You look at Eli shows up, he's got Khakis
on, he tucks his shirt in. I mean that's,

535
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:58,800
that's what the giants, I guess
have become, I don't know,

536
00:31:58,890 --> 00:32:03,840
you listened to some of those lt
stories. Oh, Dosha fit right in. But, um,

537
00:32:04,920 --> 00:32:07,200
I dunno, it was a big move and I don't,
I don't think they had to give all,

538
00:32:07,201 --> 00:32:11,730
give up too much for the guy and they got
a lot of draft picks, see what they do.

539
00:32:11,790 --> 00:32:12,351
And uh,

540
00:32:12,351 --> 00:32:15,110
I've gotten a couple of friends of mine
that a Cleveland Brown fans and they're

541
00:32:15,150 --> 00:32:19,350
all saying that GM knows what he's doing.
So who knows?

542
00:32:20,310 --> 00:32:21,143
Okay.

543
00:32:21,990 --> 00:32:25,740
The only thing I need out of Cleveland
fans is to stop calling you stupid city.

544
00:32:25,741 --> 00:32:29,980
The land, the land. Ugh.

545
00:32:31,480 --> 00:32:35,290
Fucking Midwest people.
The land,

546
00:32:35,830 --> 00:32:40,580
the Berg,
did they call Cincinnati the natty.

547
00:32:41,620 --> 00:32:42,400
Okay.

548
00:32:42,400 --> 00:32:46,630
Get on the bus.
You're in Columbus.

549
00:32:46,870 --> 00:32:51,670
You get it the day.
Welcome to the day.

550
00:32:52,350 --> 00:32:56,510
Is that what they say? Dayton? Huh? Um,

551
00:32:57,710 --> 00:33:02,410
all right. Sorry. I'm being a cunt, but
it's what I do. All right. That's it.

552
00:33:02,440 --> 00:33:03,550
I'm going to be,
uh,

553
00:33:04,150 --> 00:33:08,830
out and about in La doing some
spots bombing this weekend.

554
00:33:09,910 --> 00:33:14,620
Uh, probably be down the store on Friday.
That's the deal. All right, so go Bruins,

555
00:33:14,730 --> 00:33:17,950
go Celtics.
Baseball is starting up.

556
00:33:18,460 --> 00:33:20,970
A interesting stat here,
man.

557
00:33:20,980 --> 00:33:23,470
This is something that on the
success of the New York Yankees,

558
00:33:23,471 --> 00:33:26,140
do you realize the New York
Yankees is so fucking successful?

559
00:33:26,560 --> 00:33:30,290
That sense they got babe Ruth all right.

560
00:33:30,500 --> 00:33:33,830
From the 1920s to this decade,

561
00:33:33,860 --> 00:33:36,650
they've only gone one decade
where they didn't win a war,

562
00:33:36,680 --> 00:33:41,150
at least one world series. And
that was the 1980s. And even still,

563
00:33:41,180 --> 00:33:44,360
they went to a world series in
[inaudible] 81 in lost. Right.

564
00:33:44,450 --> 00:33:45,710
If they don't win this year,

565
00:33:46,040 --> 00:33:49,190
this'll be the first time that that's
the only second time this has happened

566
00:33:49,760 --> 00:33:53,780
since women were allowed to vote.
Okay.

567
00:33:53,810 --> 00:33:57,440
Which was another huge,
huge fucking mistake by this country.

568
00:33:58,570 --> 00:33:59,403
Okay.

569
00:34:00,820 --> 00:34:04,030
You should have kept those fucking
broads in the kitchen. No. Um,

570
00:34:04,060 --> 00:34:05,710
I think it's great that
they can talk more.

571
00:34:12,790 --> 00:34:15,070
Um,
anyways.

572
00:34:16,120 --> 00:34:19,480
Am I the only one who's like not
looking forward to this next election,

573
00:34:19,570 --> 00:34:22,810
presidential election? I
just, I just don't see this.

574
00:34:23,350 --> 00:34:27,370
I just didn't see it being ever repeat
of a few years ago and it's just going to

575
00:34:27,371 --> 00:34:29,230
be a fucking train wreck.

576
00:34:31,130 --> 00:34:31,963
MMM.

577
00:34:32,180 --> 00:34:34,400
Until you get that cancer
out of the locker room.

578
00:34:35,960 --> 00:34:38,300
I just don't know what it's
going to be. I, if I, you know,

579
00:34:38,301 --> 00:34:40,640
if I was running for president
on the democratic side,

580
00:34:40,641 --> 00:34:44,180
what I would learn how to do
is talk some shit. All right?

581
00:34:44,240 --> 00:34:46,340
Stop trying to talk about issues.

582
00:34:46,341 --> 00:34:48,770
What you need to do is you need
to go in there and you need,

583
00:34:48,940 --> 00:34:51,590
you need to make fun of his hair.
Make Fun of that to pay.

584
00:34:52,160 --> 00:34:54,440
Make Fun of his fucking big motherly hips.

585
00:34:54,680 --> 00:34:59,600
You gotta you gotta go after him
like that. All right? Why is,

586
00:34:59,601 --> 00:35:03,080
why is your face orange and
underneath your eyes, his ghost white?

587
00:35:03,830 --> 00:35:04,910
Do you have a tanning bed?

588
00:35:05,060 --> 00:35:09,290
Is that some sort of cream that you
put under your eyes for puffiness?

589
00:35:09,320 --> 00:35:10,153
That's what you do.

590
00:35:10,280 --> 00:35:14,000
Do not go up there and try to talk policy
and interrupt the shit out of them.

591
00:35:14,360 --> 00:35:18,140
Just do what he does.
Completely ignore all the fucking rules.

592
00:35:18,920 --> 00:35:22,190
And then when you get called on it
just act like a victim. All right?

593
00:35:22,191 --> 00:35:25,470
That's what it's going to be. This is what
politics is fucking become. [inaudible]

594
00:35:26,650 --> 00:35:27,483
MMM.

595
00:35:28,190 --> 00:35:33,170
I mean I'm acting like it was on the
up and up before that. But uh, I dunno.

596
00:35:33,290 --> 00:35:36,170
We shall see. Although I do have to
give Trump some props ground in that,

597
00:35:36,230 --> 00:35:39,810
that airplane,
he did do that.

598
00:35:39,900 --> 00:35:43,800
He did try to pull the troops
out of Syria. You saw the
Democrats and Republican.

599
00:35:43,990 --> 00:35:45,420
Oh whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Don't do that.

600
00:35:45,450 --> 00:35:48,870
You bite the hand that
feeds by net corporate cash.

601
00:35:48,871 --> 00:35:50,580
I'll spill it out of their pockets.

602
00:35:50,790 --> 00:35:54,000
And you watch all you ladies out
there loving your girl there.

603
00:35:54,540 --> 00:35:58,650
The 29 year old check you
watch you fucking well how
soon before she gets a book

604
00:35:58,651 --> 00:36:02,640
deal, how sue before, she's
somehow a multimillionaire,

605
00:36:02,641 --> 00:36:04,950
only making 150 200 grand a year,

606
00:36:06,540 --> 00:36:10,230
but she has a vagina so Saudi you,
so you should vote for it, right?

607
00:36:10,231 --> 00:36:13,260
That should make you feel good. All
right, that was a country way to end,

608
00:36:13,290 --> 00:36:15,810
but that's how it's going to happen.
Enjoy the music.

609
00:36:15,811 --> 00:36:20,460
And there'll be another half hour of a
greatest hits from a Thursday afternoon,

earlier this year or years before.

612
00:36:26,930 --> 00:36:28,470
And I don't fuck it.

613
00:36:28,680 --> 00:36:33,080
Have a great weekend. You cuts go
Liverpool. I'll see you on Monday.

614

615
00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:53,713
You and me.

616
00:37:01,070 --> 00:37:05,990
They give me a hug.

00:37:15,770 --> 00:37:17,550
she's like 52 and she's still in sexy.

620
00:37:17,551 --> 00:37:20,790
So it was like Tyra got
a lot of years to go day.

621
00:37:22,440 --> 00:37:26,940
Who did we see walking away
from that hotel that day? Oh,

622
00:37:26,941 --> 00:37:31,230
I Cheryl t Cheryl Tiegs. They're
looking good. That time is a bitch, man.

623
00:37:31,950 --> 00:37:36,510
Really is a bitch. No, a realist change.

624
00:37:37,070 --> 00:37:39,060
Minimum. Forgot doing.

625
00:37:40,020 --> 00:37:44,580
I think you got a bit of a fetish known
you for awhile and older white women and

626
00:37:44,581 --> 00:37:47,190
he picks a bag with Hillary Clinton,
Iowa.

627
00:37:47,700 --> 00:37:51,720
My favorite number one is a Carly Simon.

628
00:37:51,721 --> 00:37:55,500
I will still pop each time and
I don't know why. I know why.

629
00:37:56,190 --> 00:37:59,420
Everybody got their fucking
fetishes album cover alone,

630
00:38:00,100 --> 00:38:04,560
which she was on all fours. Oh Wow. That
big mouth. Yeah, that's what I'm saying.

631
00:38:04,970 --> 00:38:09,300
John Brockman that pitches by the way,
a lot of people backed us up on that one.

632
00:38:09,360 --> 00:38:14,060
Wow. Yeah. Backyard. A lot of people
were calling him and saying, Lord, Chuck,

633
00:38:14,720 --> 00:38:19,020
celebrity pop up.
Moving back though.

634
00:38:19,021 --> 00:38:22,860
We saw Cheryl Tiegs leaving the
Donald Trump pros. Yeah, Cheryl Tiegs.

635
00:38:22,861 --> 00:38:27,540
We had the great seats from Vos. Well,
yeah, probably fairly in the building.

636
00:38:27,600 --> 00:38:32,430
Thanks Richard. I got your checklist
for the Trump roast section. Oh,

637
00:38:32,610 --> 00:38:35,040
it's going to be [inaudible] we,

638
00:38:35,290 --> 00:38:40,290
we were behind a monitor that was
showing the rows behind it on the second

639
00:38:41,921 --> 00:38:45,750
floor. Dude, everyone's going in the main
ballroom and we handed our tickets like,

640
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:49,750
oh, we're going to be hobnobbing with the,
the top celebrities in New York. Right.

641
00:38:49,990 --> 00:38:52,690
All of a sudden the usher, it looks
at our tickets and goes, Oh God,

642
00:38:52,691 --> 00:38:57,400
take that elevator. But the,
and then you're thinking,

643
00:38:57,401 --> 00:38:59,260
all right, well, you
know, it's an elevator.

644
00:38:59,470 --> 00:39:04,120
You ever see a roast with as an upstairs?
It's always, it's the, the day is,

645
00:39:04,121 --> 00:39:08,170
and the tables upstairs that are roasts.
So at first we're like, all right,

646
00:39:08,171 --> 00:39:11,150
well we'll follow all the other people
that have seats in that area. No,

647
00:39:11,170 --> 00:39:15,160
there were maybe another 20 people that
had Seattle area and we sit down and

648
00:39:15,161 --> 00:39:17,020
then I,
I my seat stunk.

649
00:39:17,021 --> 00:39:21,010
I had him stand up and look over
this video screen to see anything.

650
00:39:21,170 --> 00:39:23,670
I couldn't tell who was up at the,
they were tying,

651
00:39:24,450 --> 00:39:27,700
everybody gets in the elevators
like holding cable and shit. Yeah,

652
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:30,700
that's what it was. They
were all tech guys. Gaffers,

653
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:33,910
they are heading for the
fucking mixing board.

654
00:39:34,120 --> 00:39:36,820
So we're heading for the
walkways high above. So we leave.

655
00:39:36,821 --> 00:39:39,290
The roasts were walking back
towards the station and uh,

656
00:39:39,460 --> 00:39:44,460
we were right behind Cheryl Tiegs and
her white old Sechi has like how bad did

657
00:39:46,031 --> 00:39:49,240
it looked at? I mean,
here's what I'm saying,

658
00:39:49,660 --> 00:39:54,010
for an old old lady,
she probably isn't that bad.

659
00:39:54,550 --> 00:39:59,350
But when you compare her to the Cheryl
Tiegs poster that was on everybody's wall

660
00:39:59,530 --> 00:40:03,640
with the netting that she was just
wearing a net and her nipples were poking

661
00:40:03,750 --> 00:40:08,550
through. I mean, you wouldn't fuck
Sophia Loren. No, just cause she exists.

662
00:40:08,551 --> 00:40:12,000
60 something
ran.

663
00:40:14,300 --> 00:40:18,810
I don't gotta be just a
glimpse of just young.

664
00:40:19,260 --> 00:40:23,560
So phase one trial, half a pussy
lip, paint, nothing out there.

665
00:40:24,090 --> 00:40:26,670
Believe me.
And when you see these people out,

666
00:40:27,930 --> 00:40:30,810
remember they are looking
their absolute best.

667
00:40:31,200 --> 00:40:34,890
This is the best they can possibly look.
How old is shared with Teagues?

668
00:40:34,980 --> 00:40:36,540
50 got to bed.

669
00:40:36,570 --> 00:40:41,120
She's gotta be old manner in her fifth
phase five and she's gonna Finish and no

670
00:40:41,300 --> 00:40:46,140
red beam and sexuality. She's not drunk.
I didn't see any redeeming sexuality.

671
00:40:46,141 --> 00:40:50,940
I saw an older woman
that you look at and go,

672
00:40:52,060 --> 00:40:53,700
all right, she's, you know,

673
00:40:53,730 --> 00:40:56,520
an older woman that doesn't look
like she's ready to fall apart.

674
00:40:56,960 --> 00:41:01,960
What do you know the old broad w women
like who continue to dye their hair like

675
00:41:02,641 --> 00:41:06,910
that? It becomes like a fucking
birds nest itself right out there.

676
00:41:07,120 --> 00:41:09,470
That also as you get into like you,

677
00:41:10,200 --> 00:41:14,070
you get into like your sixties
it's like the smell of rotten.

678
00:41:14,390 --> 00:41:17,650
If you're attending deaths. Study
started having that old person's smell.

679
00:41:17,660 --> 00:41:19,230
So when you see the top of their head,

680
00:41:19,710 --> 00:41:23,280
because then it gets to what you taught
and you see that you see right through

681
00:41:23,281 --> 00:41:27,720
that penny hair. It's like
fucking white cotton candy, hair,

682
00:41:28,580 --> 00:41:29,980
scalp price at a Lowe's.

683
00:41:30,260 --> 00:41:34,370
They'd fucking box in the back of her
hand and she jerking you off. Yes,

684
00:41:36,280 --> 00:41:40,700
you got it. You got a fucking old Sophia
Loren and fucking movie on the TV.

685
00:41:40,940 --> 00:41:45,570
Try not to look at the, what happened
to that rod? Don't you got back up?

686
00:41:48,830 --> 00:41:51,750
Oh Shit. Bitch. Close your eyes.

687
00:41:52,690 --> 00:41:53,840
Close Your eyes

of that Bitch. Right on man. No, she, she,

689
00:42:02,781 --> 00:42:06,320

But you know you have a yeah,

690
00:42:06,321 --> 00:42:11,010
just against, you're just against old
bitches. I can feel it. You know what?

691
00:42:11,600 --> 00:42:15,740
I disagree with that.
It's not that I, I went,

00:42:26,171 --> 00:42:28,700

696
00:42:28,701 --> 00:42:31,190
I'm trying to stay knew her was
because she was a sex symbol.

697
00:42:31,191 --> 00:42:35,760
So already there your old

698
00:42:36,170 --> 00:42:40,130

699
00:42:40,340 --> 00:42:44,390
that used to be hot, super hot and
just maintained it. But like, oh wow.

700
00:42:44,450 --> 00:42:46,340
She used to wait. She,
she used to be super hot,

701
00:42:46,880 --> 00:42:50,510
but now she's an old bitch like Cheryl
Tiegs. But she's still like, you know

704
00:43:04,340 --> 00:43:08,120
Dukey makeup I'm talking about right

717
00:44:02,330 --> 00:44:06,080
the mother from little house,
Barry Ross was a bit of a whore.

718
00:44:06,260 --> 00:44:09,230
While there's always, yeah, there's always
answered. Yeah, that is hot as shit.

719
00:44:09,231 --> 00:44:11,180
Something her and Fonzie going to go.
No.

720
00:44:11,181 --> 00:44:14,800
Talk about my mom that there's
always ads. Mom, shut up Anthony.

721
00:44:15,200 --> 00:44:16,033
His mother's heart.
Yeah.

722
00:44:16,110 --> 00:44:21,050
Never talk about my mom like
that just takes care of herself.

723
00:44:21,220 --> 00:44:24,380
But you know, she's no spring
chicken. That's what you guys love.

724
00:44:24,381 --> 00:44:27,020
Real awkward moment. I have with a
good friend of mine, the other daily,

725
00:44:27,170 --> 00:44:32,160
he came to town, I took her to a Knicks
game. Right? He's sitting there, right?

726
00:44:32,490 --> 00:44:37,180
And I go, uh, and he, he's
talking about my little sister.
He goes, well, how, how, uh,

727
00:44:37,620 --> 00:44:42,130
how old? How old is she now? Huh? And I'm
like, uh, he is she in high school yet?

728
00:44:42,170 --> 00:44:44,820
I go, dude, if you can believe that
she's graduating high school. He goes,

729
00:44:44,821 --> 00:44:47,430
good Lord. We're getting old. Like,
yeah, you should see it. I mean,

730
00:44:47,431 --> 00:44:50,100
she knows beautiful girl.
And he goes, he goes, well,

731
00:44:50,101 --> 00:44:51,900
the apple doesn't fall
too far from the tree.

732
00:44:52,080 --> 00:44:55,080
Your mother was always really attractive,
but it was just kind of silenced,

733
00:44:56,710 --> 00:45:00,630
so used to jerk off to my mom.
That's great. Great to know. Yeah.

734
00:45:00,631 --> 00:45:05,631
You got to fill in the blank
and that the RBS bridge to,

735
00:45:05,740 --> 00:45:10,460
yeah. Lynda Carter. Pat Benatar,

736
00:45:11,540 --> 00:45:15,060
Katar, Lynda Carter. Now Lynda Carter.

737
00:45:15,700 --> 00:45:17,640
Now Linda fucking,
yes.

738
00:45:17,670 --> 00:45:21,300
Let me say something I want into Lynda
Carter when she was wonder woman else.

739
00:45:21,780 --> 00:45:25,890
Dad Bitch from Buck Rogers
and 20 for the Aaron Gray.

740
00:45:26,070 --> 00:45:29,940
She was very hot during that time.

741
00:45:30,820 --> 00:45:34,600
Now God, she's still a hotbed.
She's dumped on my Suzanne Summers,

742
00:45:35,790 --> 00:45:39,240
but she got that carved up
faced I shit is really old man.

743
00:45:39,270 --> 00:45:42,310
Let's go to a gym in Waco.
Jim. She kept those tapes.

744
00:45:45,030 --> 00:45:46,120
Every time I see her,

745
00:45:48,060 --> 00:45:53,060
I hated those fucking big bloomer
panty thing she wore and they didn't

746
00:45:58,570 --> 00:46:03,070
[inaudible] Victoria's secrets by now.
Big Bloom.

747
00:46:03,200 --> 00:46:07,560
My bitch with those boots, not, I
was never into higher even as a kid,

748
00:46:07,561 --> 00:46:10,460
like when she was wonder woman.
She was motherly looking.

749
00:46:10,620 --> 00:46:15,420
How about Lani and she's just,
she's just,

750
00:46:15,600 --> 00:46:15,901
she's,

751
00:46:15,901 --> 00:46:20,760
when I was fucking terrified when I
was 10 I was into 10 year old girls.

752
00:46:20,910 --> 00:46:25,710
When I was 12 I was it to 12 year
old girls, 1414 year old girls.

753
00:46:25,711 --> 00:46:26,580
That's how I went.

754
00:46:26,581 --> 00:46:30,780
I was never like 14
into 38 year old women.

755
00:46:31,230 --> 00:46:35,280
I never found them attractive. They were
like moms, so whatever your name is,

756
00:46:35,281 --> 00:46:35,731
your whatever.

757
00:46:35,731 --> 00:46:40,510
My age was up until 15 and then
it was always just 15 year olds.

758
00:46:40,910 --> 00:46:43,890
So they just did, he just made, okay,

759
00:46:43,891 --> 00:46:47,820
so 14 you weren't into 28 year olds.
Now that means though,

760
00:46:48,030 --> 00:46:48,990
so let's double it.

761
00:46:49,320 --> 00:46:52,710
He's not into something double
his age shows aunties by eight.

762
00:46:52,711 --> 00:46:55,640
So how old was show gotta be 122 years.

763
00:46:57,720 --> 00:47:01,260
I was trying to back you into that corner.
I know

764
00:47:02,950 --> 00:47:06,450
Derek is coming. Oh Derrick.
Still hot. Bo. Derek now. Okay.

765
00:47:06,600 --> 00:47:11,400
If you got to point out a hotter, older
woman. All right, I'll give it to Bo.

766
00:47:11,401 --> 00:47:12,030
Derek.

767
00:47:12,030 --> 00:47:15,600
She still looks good so it doesn't look
like she's trying to keep yourself young

768
00:47:15,720 --> 00:47:16,900
with fucking surgery and chip.

769
00:47:17,310 --> 00:47:20,940
There's nothing worse than these duck
billed fucking old broads walking around

770
00:47:21,760 --> 00:47:25,710
[inaudible] I rejected the lips
thinking it looks good, ladies.

771
00:47:25,860 --> 00:47:29,170
You Look Freakish. You look like
ducks. It's creepy. They talk like,

772
00:47:31,130 --> 00:47:34,740
God, please got a pedicure
appointment for next week. One out.

773
00:47:35,980 --> 00:47:39,040
Oh, there's a creepy, I don't
like that. Look at all it is.

774
00:48:16,420 --> 00:48:17,253
[inaudible]

775
00:48:48,730 --> 00:48:51,190
we'll assume that any
man

776
00:48:53,790 --> 00:48:57,810
finds a streetlight
steps out of the shade is

777
00:48:59,720 --> 00:49:00,553
you and me?

778
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:00,833
[inaudible] [inaudible]

779
00:51:07,480 --> 00:51:08,313
[inaudible] [inaudible]

780
00:51:18,960 --> 00:51:19,793
