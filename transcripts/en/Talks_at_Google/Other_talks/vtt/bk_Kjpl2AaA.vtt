SIMON SINGH: Great.

00:00:04.070 --> 00:00:06.403
Thank you very much for
inviting me here to speak today.

00:00:06.403 --> 00:00:07.897
So this is the
book-- "The Simpsons

00:00:07.897 --> 00:00:09.230
And Their Mathematical Secrets."

00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:11.230
I've been working on
this book-- I first

00:00:11.230 --> 00:00:14.530
started writing to the writers
about eight or nine years ago.

00:00:14.530 --> 00:00:16.200
And for the last
eight or nine years,

00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:17.195
I've been thinking
about this book

00:00:17.195 --> 00:00:18.590
and talking about this book.

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:20.890
And whenever I talk
about "The Simpsons"

00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:23.000
and I say to people there's
tons of maths hidden

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:28.370
in "The Simpsons," people are
always shocked and surprised.

00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:30.180
And what I'm trying
to do in this book is,

00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:32.280
I'm trying to explain
to people that there

00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:35.169
are lots of writers on
"The Simpsons" who love.

00:00:35.169 --> 00:00:36.960
There are lots of
writers on "The Simpsons"

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:39.180
who studied mathematics
to degree level,

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:41.789
to master's level, to PhD level.

00:00:41.789 --> 00:00:43.330
Now they're no longer
mathematicians,

00:00:43.330 --> 00:00:46.430
they're now writers, but
they still love mathematics.

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:48.200
And the way they
express that love

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:50.780
is by putting little
bits of mathematics

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:53.637
into the series-- often
when we're not looking.

00:00:53.637 --> 00:00:55.220
What sort of thing
am I talking about?

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:57.150
Well, for example,
here's an episode

00:00:57.150 --> 00:00:59.395
called, "Marge + Homer
Turn a Couple Play."

00:00:59.395 --> 00:01:03.950
The story here is that
Buck "Home Run" Mitchell

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:06.030
is married to Tabitha Vixx.

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:10.582
And Tabitha Vixx and
Buck have a marital spat.

00:01:10.582 --> 00:01:11.790
Their marriage is in trouble.

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:13.880
They go and talk
to Homer and Marge

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:16.150
and Homer and Marge
repair their marriage.

00:01:16.150 --> 00:01:18.720
And by the end of the episode
everything's all right.

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:22.300
But the very finale of
the episode, Tabitha

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:24.461
proclaims her love to Buck.

00:01:24.461 --> 00:01:26.460
But at the end of the
episode, at the same time,

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:29.900
on the Jumbo-Vision screen
at Springfield Stadium, what

00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:33.420
you see is this question up
on the Jumbo-Vision screen.

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:37.300
And it asks the crowd, what's
the attendance at the game?

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:41.000
Is it 8191, is it
8128, is it 8208,

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:42.330
or is there no way to tell?

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:43.709
OK.

00:01:43.709 --> 00:01:45.750
And nobody ever noticed
this, because everybody's

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:48.050
paying attention to Tabitha.

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:49.860
Nobody ever noticed
these numbers.

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:52.650
But each one of these
numbers is there

00:01:52.650 --> 00:01:53.940
for a very special reason.

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:55.950
It's there because each
one of those numbers

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:57.970
is mathematically significant.

00:01:57.970 --> 00:02:01.850
So for example, you take
the first number, 8191.

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:04.070
8191 is a prime number.

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:05.740
Some of you may
have spotted that.

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:07.580
But it's not just
any old prime number,

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:09.960
it's a Mersenne prime number.

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:12.430
So Mersenne prime numbers
have this very special form.

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:15.260
They're of the form 2 to
the power of p minus 1,

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:17.570
where p is also a prime number.

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:21.070
So in this case, if you
raise it to the power 13,

00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:26.150
2 to the power of 13
minus 1, you get 8191.

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:29.980
So somebody put in that
8191, because, OK, it's

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:32.710
a plausible number
for a baseball crowd.

00:02:32.710 --> 00:02:35.326
But it's also a Mersenne number.

00:02:35.326 --> 00:02:38.040
And Mersenne primes
are very special.

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:40.410
I think the ten
biggest prime numbers

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:43.330
we know are all Mersenne primes.

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:45.357
So somebody put some
thought into that.

00:02:45.357 --> 00:02:46.690
And the next number is the same.

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:48.080
The next number is 8128.

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:49.780
8128 is a very special number.

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:51.820
It's what's known
as a perfect number,

00:02:51.820 --> 00:02:54.280
and a perfect number is
one of those numbers where

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:57.890
the divisors is of the number
add up to the number itself.

00:02:57.890 --> 00:03:00.030
So the simplest example is 6.

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:04.580
1, 2, and 3 divide into 6,
and 1 plus 2 plus 3 equals 6.

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:08.600
Next perfect number is 28
because 1, 2, 4, 7, and 14

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:12.760
divide into 28 and
they add up to 28.

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:14.660
You might think
they're fairly common.

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:17.281
6 and 28, you
know, we're already

00:03:17.281 --> 00:03:18.780
getting a couple
of perfect numbers.

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:22.040
But the third perfect
number is 496.

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:25.970
And the fourth perfect
number is 8128.

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:29.250
And they get fewer
and further between.

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:31.400
I think Rene Descartes
said that perfect numbers,

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:34.447
like perfect men, are very rare.

00:03:34.447 --> 00:03:36.030
And they're rare,
and they're special,

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:38.270
so they get to be
on the scoreboard.

00:03:38.270 --> 00:03:40.910
Third number, this is a number
I hadn't really heard of,

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:42.940
a type of number I
hadn't heard of before I

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:44.280
started writing this book.

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:50.350
8208, what's special about
8208 is, it's got four digits

00:03:50.350 --> 00:03:54.290
and so what you do is you raise
each digit to the fourth power.

00:03:54.290 --> 00:03:57.580
Four digits, so you raise each
digit to the fourth power.

00:03:57.580 --> 00:04:00.070
8 to the power 4
plus 2 to the power 4

00:04:00.070 --> 00:04:03.332
plus 0 to the power
plus 8 to the power 4.

00:04:03.332 --> 00:04:04.540
Sorry, let me say that again.

00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:07.330
8 to the power 4 plus 2 to the
power 4 plus 0 to the power 4

00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:08.700
plus 8 to the power 4.

00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:12.850
Add those together and
you get back to 8208.

00:04:12.850 --> 00:04:17.269
So the number regenerates
itself from its own components.

00:04:17.269 --> 00:04:20.399
It's kind of in love
with itself and so

00:04:20.399 --> 00:04:23.000
it's called a
narcissistic number.

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:25.640
And again these
numbers are very rare.

00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:27.940
There's less than a hundred
of them that we know of.

00:04:27.940 --> 00:04:29.240
And the biggest one is that.

00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:31.526
I think it's about
39 digits long.

00:04:31.526 --> 00:04:33.650
And you might want to have
a think this afternoon--

00:04:33.650 --> 00:04:37.000
because I know the kind of
people you are --why you cannot

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:40.900
have a narcissistic number
with more than 39 digits, OK.

00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:43.489
They're rare, they're special,
there's less than 100 of them.

00:04:43.489 --> 00:04:45.780
They get to have a special
place up on the score board.

00:04:45.780 --> 00:04:48.370
So this is the kind of
thing I'm talking about,

00:04:48.370 --> 00:04:52.310
really niche mathematical
knowledge embedded

00:04:52.310 --> 00:04:55.760
within an episode for
no particular reason.

00:04:55.760 --> 00:04:57.230
I had to mention this one.

00:04:57.230 --> 00:05:00.050
The cinema, the movie
theater in Springfield

00:05:00.050 --> 00:05:03.020
is called the Springfield
Googolplex Theatre.

00:05:03.020 --> 00:05:06.960
And I guess this is part of
your history here at Google.

00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:09.930
So I'll tell it to you anyway.

00:05:09.930 --> 00:05:11.159
The googol, of course.

00:05:11.159 --> 00:05:12.950
Again, you have to
remember, the first time

00:05:12.950 --> 00:05:15.330
the googolplex appeared
in the Simpsons

00:05:15.330 --> 00:05:19.790
was back in the early 1990s,
so before the company Google

00:05:19.790 --> 00:05:20.900
existed.

00:05:20.900 --> 00:05:22.510
So nowadays people
may have an idea

00:05:22.510 --> 00:05:24.410
about what a googol
is mathematically,

00:05:24.410 --> 00:05:26.290
what a googolplex
is mathematically.

00:05:26.290 --> 00:05:28.450
But when this first
appeared on the Simpsons,

00:05:28.450 --> 00:05:30.100
nobody had heard of a googol.

00:05:30.100 --> 00:05:32.300
Nobody had heard
of a googolplex.

00:05:32.300 --> 00:05:35.030
And so it was a really
in-joke for the mathematicians

00:05:35.030 --> 00:05:37.800
who were watching.

00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:41.730
The name googol was invented by
a mathematician and his nephew.

00:05:41.730 --> 00:05:44.400
The mathematician
was Edward Kasner.

00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:46.510
And he was going for a
walk with his nephew.

00:05:46.510 --> 00:05:50.790
And he said, okay-- a million's
got 6 0's, a billion's got 9

00:05:50.790 --> 00:05:52.650
0's, a trillion's got 12 0's.

00:05:52.650 --> 00:05:55.580
What do we call a
number with 100 0's?

00:05:55.580 --> 00:05:58.509
And his nephew said why
don't we call it a googol?

00:05:58.509 --> 00:06:00.300
And that's where the
name googol came from.

00:06:00.300 --> 00:06:03.671
A googol is a number
1 followed by 100 0's.

00:06:03.671 --> 00:06:05.420
And then the uncle
said, OK, well a googol

00:06:05.420 --> 00:06:07.250
sounds like a good number.

00:06:07.250 --> 00:06:08.740
What about a googolplex?

00:06:08.740 --> 00:06:10.224
What would a googolplex be?

00:06:10.224 --> 00:06:11.640
And the nephew
thought about that,

00:06:11.640 --> 00:06:12.848
and he said, OK, that's easy.

00:06:12.848 --> 00:06:15.560
A googolplex is 1
followed by so many 0's

00:06:15.560 --> 00:06:18.050
that your arm gets tired.

00:06:18.050 --> 00:06:20.340
Now that's not very
mathematically reliable,

00:06:20.340 --> 00:06:25.280
so the uncle said, OK, well a
googol is 10 to the power 100.

00:06:25.280 --> 00:06:28.230
A googolplex is 10 to
the power of googol.

00:06:28.230 --> 00:06:31.100
So again, this is a really
mathematical in-joke

00:06:31.100 --> 00:06:32.194
in "The Simpsons."

00:06:32.194 --> 00:06:33.860
Now, who's putting
these jokes in there?

00:06:33.860 --> 00:06:35.670
Who's making these references?

00:06:35.670 --> 00:06:40.800
Well, that particular reference
was probably made by this chap

00:06:40.800 --> 00:06:42.607
here.

00:06:42.607 --> 00:06:44.190
In the back row,
second from the left,

00:06:44.190 --> 00:06:46.330
is a chap called Mike Reiss.

00:06:46.330 --> 00:06:49.090
I say probably Mike
because the writing

00:06:49.090 --> 00:06:51.520
process on "The Simpsons"
is very collaborative,

00:06:51.520 --> 00:06:54.510
and we're going
back 20 years now,

00:06:54.510 --> 00:06:56.960
and so it's hard to
remember who said what.

00:06:56.960 --> 00:06:59.930
And people are very generous
in terms of sharing credit.

00:06:59.930 --> 00:07:02.520
But it was probably
Mike Reiss in this case.

00:07:02.520 --> 00:07:04.160
I met the "Simpsons"
writers last year

00:07:04.160 --> 00:07:05.490
and I chatted to all of them.

00:07:05.490 --> 00:07:06.730
And I met Mike.

00:07:06.730 --> 00:07:13.460
And Mike's interest in maths
goes back a long, long way.

00:07:13.460 --> 00:07:16.064
When he was in the high school
math team, he was very good,

00:07:16.064 --> 00:07:16.855
he was very strong.

00:07:16.855 --> 00:07:18.790
He competed against
other schools,

00:07:18.790 --> 00:07:20.350
competed at state level.

00:07:20.350 --> 00:07:23.350
He was a very bright, a
very strong mathematician.

00:07:23.350 --> 00:07:26.470
He was also a very
keen writer and loved

00:07:26.470 --> 00:07:27.975
comedy, loved comedy writing.

00:07:27.975 --> 00:07:30.100
So even when he was younger
than that, when he was,

00:07:30.100 --> 00:07:33.725
I think, 11 or 12, he told me
he went to the dentist one day,

00:07:33.725 --> 00:07:35.350
and he was waiting
in the waiting room,

00:07:35.350 --> 00:07:37.906
and he was reading through
"New York" magazine.

00:07:37.906 --> 00:07:40.280
So, not "The New Yorker," but
"New York" magazine, and he

00:07:40.280 --> 00:07:41.696
was looking at the
back page where

00:07:41.696 --> 00:07:44.401
they have the cartoon
caption competition.

00:07:44.401 --> 00:07:46.650
And he was looking at the
cartoon caption competition,

00:07:46.650 --> 00:07:48.870
the dentist came back
and said, oh, look, Mike.

00:07:48.870 --> 00:07:51.480
I see you're looking at the
cartoon caption competition.

00:07:51.480 --> 00:07:53.700
I enter that
competition every month.

00:07:53.700 --> 00:07:56.310
I always manage to think
of something every month.

00:07:56.310 --> 00:08:01.150
And Mike said, yes, so do I.
And I've won it three times.

00:08:01.150 --> 00:08:05.020
And he was competing against
TV comedy writers in New York

00:08:05.020 --> 00:08:06.690
and winning this competition.

00:08:06.690 --> 00:08:11.170
So he had this talent for
comedy writing and mathematics.

00:08:11.170 --> 00:08:13.010
Somebody else who was
in the room-- in fact,

00:08:13.010 --> 00:08:14.510
the chap who told
me it was probably

00:08:14.510 --> 00:08:18.389
Mike who came up with
that joke, was Al Jean.

00:08:18.389 --> 00:08:20.680
Al Jean, again this is another
high school photo of him

00:08:20.680 --> 00:08:22.420
in the mathematics team.

00:08:22.420 --> 00:08:24.620
There he is in the
back row in the middle.

00:08:24.620 --> 00:08:27.980
Al Jean, another very
bright young mathematician.

00:08:27.980 --> 00:08:31.900
In fact he was so bright that
he was taken out of-- well,

00:08:31.900 --> 00:08:34.350
he was put into
a special program

00:08:34.350 --> 00:08:35.590
for elite mathematicians.

00:08:35.590 --> 00:08:39.320
This was going back to,
I guess, the mid '70s.

00:08:39.320 --> 00:08:41.760
And the idea was America
wanted to compete

00:08:41.760 --> 00:08:45.770
with the Russian elite
mathematical education system.

00:08:45.770 --> 00:08:50.220
And so people like Al Jean were
hot housed in special summer

00:08:50.220 --> 00:08:51.260
courses.

00:08:51.260 --> 00:08:53.810
And he was such a bright
young mathematician,

00:08:53.810 --> 00:08:56.750
that he went off to Harvard
to study mathematics

00:08:56.750 --> 00:08:59.460
when he was just 16 years old.

00:08:59.460 --> 00:09:01.440
So these are really
bright people.

00:09:01.440 --> 00:09:05.330
Al and Mike met at
Harvard, they left Harvard,

00:09:05.330 --> 00:09:06.700
they went into comedy writing.

00:09:06.700 --> 00:09:08.720
They joined "The
Simpsons" They worked

00:09:08.720 --> 00:09:11.440
on that very first
episode of "The Simpsons"

00:09:11.440 --> 00:09:14.430
and even in that very first
episode you get mathematics,

00:09:14.430 --> 00:09:16.970
you get mathematical references.

00:09:16.970 --> 00:09:19.720
But the interesting
thing is that, if you're

00:09:19.720 --> 00:09:22.060
looking at "The Simpsons,"
and if you look at it now

00:09:22.060 --> 00:09:24.310
and you spot a mathematical
reference-- now, you know,

00:09:24.310 --> 00:09:27.264
you'll be more eagle-eyed and
more keen to find these things.

00:09:27.264 --> 00:09:28.930
But if you find a
mathematical reference

00:09:28.930 --> 00:09:31.870
it could be that the
writer of that episode

00:09:31.870 --> 00:09:35.790
is not necessarily
an ex-mathematician.

00:09:35.790 --> 00:09:38.420
Let me explain how that happens.

00:09:38.420 --> 00:09:40.629
This is an episode
called "Marge in Chains."

00:09:40.629 --> 00:09:41.920
Now, you may remember this one.

00:09:41.920 --> 00:09:44.820
Marge is accused of theft
from the Quik-E-Mart,

00:09:44.820 --> 00:09:49.820
and she's put on trial, and
the star witness is Apu.

00:09:49.820 --> 00:09:53.570
And Lionel Hutz, the attorney,
is trying to discredit Apu

00:09:53.570 --> 00:09:55.850
and saying to him, you've
got a terrible memory.

00:09:55.850 --> 00:09:57.290
Why should we trust
your evidence?

00:09:57.290 --> 00:10:00.180
Why should we trust
your witness testimony?

00:10:00.180 --> 00:10:01.700
You've got a terrible memory.

00:10:01.700 --> 00:10:04.980
And Apu responds by saying, no
no, I've got a great memory.

00:10:04.980 --> 00:10:07.520
In fact my memory is
so good, in fact, I

00:10:07.520 --> 00:10:10.720
can recite pi to
40,000 decimal places,

00:10:10.720 --> 00:10:13.270
and the last digit is 1.

00:10:13.270 --> 00:10:14.760
So he could have said anything.

00:10:14.760 --> 00:10:16.060
He could've said I can remember
the Springfield telephone

00:10:16.060 --> 00:10:16.700
directory.

00:10:16.700 --> 00:10:18.280
But he says pi.

00:10:18.280 --> 00:10:20.400
And he talks about
reciting the digits of pi.

00:10:20.400 --> 00:10:22.275
Now, there are a couple
of interesting things

00:10:22.275 --> 00:10:25.140
behind the scenes of
this one simple line

00:10:25.140 --> 00:10:27.270
that I want to explain to you.

00:10:27.270 --> 00:10:30.280
First of all, why 40,000 digits?

00:10:30.280 --> 00:10:32.840
Why was Apu claiming
40,000 digits?

00:10:32.840 --> 00:10:37.750
Well that was the world record
in 1993 for memorizing pi.

00:10:37.750 --> 00:10:39.410
So it was a genuine
world record,

00:10:39.410 --> 00:10:42.470
and Apu claimed to
be able to match it.

00:10:42.470 --> 00:10:45.370
Sure enough, the
40,000th digit is 1.

00:10:45.370 --> 00:10:48.110
OK, can't get that wrong.

00:10:48.110 --> 00:10:49.580
In fact, you can't
get that wrong

00:10:49.580 --> 00:10:53.360
if the writing team
consults a world pi expert.

00:10:53.360 --> 00:10:55.860
They contacted a guy
called David Bailey at NASA

00:10:55.860 --> 00:10:56.450
at the time.

00:10:56.450 --> 00:10:59.400
And David Bailey was a
world authority on pi.

00:10:59.400 --> 00:11:04.090
And he'd developed something
called the spigot algorithm.

00:11:04.090 --> 00:11:05.680
When I was at
school, I was always

00:11:05.680 --> 00:11:07.096
told that if you
want to calculate

00:11:07.096 --> 00:11:09.120
the fifth digit of pi,
you need to calculate

00:11:09.120 --> 00:11:11.085
the first, second,
third, and fourth digits.

00:11:11.085 --> 00:11:13.210
If you want to calculate
the hundredth digit of pi,

00:11:13.210 --> 00:11:16.090
you've got to calculate
single digit before it.

00:11:16.090 --> 00:11:18.140
The great thing with
the spigot algorithm

00:11:18.140 --> 00:11:20.120
is that it's like a tap.

00:11:20.120 --> 00:11:22.670
A spigot is a tap
and it drips, and it

00:11:22.670 --> 00:11:26.110
will drip whichever
decimal place you want.

00:11:26.110 --> 00:11:28.650
So if you want the millionth
decimal place of pi,

00:11:28.650 --> 00:11:31.890
you just adjust the tap, and
the millionth decimal place

00:11:31.890 --> 00:11:33.150
drips out.

00:11:33.150 --> 00:11:35.280
And that's what David
Bailey invented.

00:11:35.280 --> 00:11:38.460
And he could've just
dripped the 40,000 decimal

00:11:38.460 --> 00:11:42.190
place, except the
spigot algorithm only

00:11:42.190 --> 00:11:45.650
works in hexadecimal,
which is not

00:11:45.650 --> 00:11:49.280
very friendly for a TV audience.

00:11:49.280 --> 00:11:53.290
So instead of dripping the
40,00th digit in hexadecimal,

00:11:53.290 --> 00:11:57.190
he sent them all 40,000 digits
in a big package and they could

00:11:57.190 --> 00:11:59.290
go figure out for themselves.

00:11:59.290 --> 00:12:01.720
But the other thing I wanted
to explain about this line

00:12:01.720 --> 00:12:04.060
is that this is one
of those episodes that

00:12:04.060 --> 00:12:06.194
wasn't written by
a mathematician.

00:12:06.194 --> 00:12:08.110
It was actually written
by a couple of people.

00:12:08.110 --> 00:12:11.320
It was written by Josh
Weinstein and Bill Oakley.

00:12:11.320 --> 00:12:15.370
And neither of them
are mathematicians.

00:12:15.370 --> 00:12:19.350
So the question is, why are
non-mathematicians putting math

00:12:19.350 --> 00:12:21.500
into their episodes as well?

00:12:21.500 --> 00:12:25.060
And the way this happened
was-- I met Josh last year,

00:12:25.060 --> 00:12:27.680
and he said that
that wasn't his line.

00:12:27.680 --> 00:12:29.989
He and Bill didn't
come up with that line.

00:12:29.989 --> 00:12:32.280
What had happened was that
they were given that episode

00:12:32.280 --> 00:12:35.764
to write, they went away
for a couple of weeks,

00:12:35.764 --> 00:12:37.180
and they wrote the
broad structure

00:12:37.180 --> 00:12:38.960
of the story, the
key plot points.

00:12:38.960 --> 00:12:40.750
They put in the key jokes.

00:12:40.750 --> 00:12:43.990
And then they bring it back to
the rest of the writing team.

00:12:43.990 --> 00:12:47.250
And the rest of the
writing team will maybe

00:12:47.250 --> 00:12:49.840
identify the weaker jokes
and take them out, maybe

00:12:49.840 --> 00:12:53.230
help make some of the
good jokes even better.

00:12:53.230 --> 00:12:56.350
And it's at that stage
that around the table

00:12:56.350 --> 00:12:59.910
there will almost certainly
be one or two mathematicians.

00:12:59.910 --> 00:13:03.400
And that's the stage at which
you can introduce mathematics

00:13:03.400 --> 00:13:06.390
into a script that otherwise
was devoid of mathematics.

00:13:06.390 --> 00:13:08.790
So in this case
the original script

00:13:08.790 --> 00:13:11.935
said-- Josh dug this
up from his garage,

00:13:11.935 --> 00:13:14.080
the original script
--Lionel Hutz

00:13:14.080 --> 00:13:17.410
says to Apu, "So, Mr.
Nahasapeemapetilon,

00:13:17.410 --> 00:13:20.830
if that is your real name, have
you ever forgotten anything?"

00:13:20.830 --> 00:13:21.810
And Apu says, "No.

00:13:21.810 --> 00:13:23.305
In India I was
known as Mr. Memory.

00:13:23.305 --> 00:13:25.770
I featured in over 400 films,
including 'Here Comes Mr.

00:13:25.770 --> 00:13:26.420
Memory.'"

00:13:26.420 --> 00:13:28.820
So nothing to do with pi.

00:13:28.820 --> 00:13:31.055
But you can imagine,
around that table

00:13:31.055 --> 00:13:32.930
the mathematicians
would've said, yeah here's

00:13:32.930 --> 00:13:36.720
an opportunity to get some
maths in, some mathematics.

00:13:36.720 --> 00:13:41.520
But it's also an opportunity
to build up Apu's back story.

00:13:41.520 --> 00:13:43.330
Because you may or
may not be aware

00:13:43.330 --> 00:13:46.384
that Apu is also
a mathematician.

00:13:46.384 --> 00:13:48.050
If you piece together
different elements

00:13:48.050 --> 00:13:50.530
from different episodes,
you get his back story.

00:13:50.530 --> 00:13:53.690
And Apu studied at Caltech.

00:13:53.690 --> 00:13:56.260
He went to Caltech--
not the California

00:13:56.260 --> 00:13:57.970
Institute of Technology,
but the Calcutta

00:13:57.970 --> 00:13:58.970
Institute of Technology.

00:14:01.390 --> 00:14:03.960
And then after graduating,
he came to America

00:14:03.960 --> 00:14:05.865
and he studied for a
PhD in computer science

00:14:05.865 --> 00:14:07.560
from Professor Frink.

00:14:07.560 --> 00:14:11.970
And he studied at the
Springfield Heights Institute

00:14:11.970 --> 00:14:15.120
for Technology, which has a
rather unfortunate acronym,

00:14:15.120 --> 00:14:17.230
as you've already spotted.

00:14:17.230 --> 00:14:19.450
So you get the
mathematics in here

00:14:19.450 --> 00:14:21.400
because it fits in
with Apu's background

00:14:21.400 --> 00:14:23.370
and you can have a
bit of fun with pi.

00:14:23.370 --> 00:14:27.000
It's easy to think that
the math in the Simpsons

00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:29.957
is going to be
linked to Lisa, it's

00:14:29.957 --> 00:14:31.540
going to be linked
to Professor Frink,

00:14:31.540 --> 00:14:33.540
it's going to be linked
to Apu, the kind of more

00:14:33.540 --> 00:14:35.340
mathematically-minded
characters.

00:14:35.340 --> 00:14:38.220
But you find that Homer and
all the other characters

00:14:38.220 --> 00:14:43.242
often exhibit, or get involved
with, mathematical references.

00:14:43.242 --> 00:14:44.700
So, for example,
this is an episode

00:14:44.700 --> 00:14:48.164
called "The Wizard of
Evergreen Terrace,"

00:14:48.164 --> 00:14:49.830
where Homer tries to
become an inventor.

00:14:53.750 --> 00:14:55.420
Again, it's kind of
a freeze frame gag,

00:14:55.420 --> 00:14:58.440
you've got to really look
carefully, because in one scene

00:14:58.440 --> 00:14:59.460
there's a blackboard.

00:14:59.460 --> 00:15:02.745
And on the blackboard
you have-- that's

00:15:02.745 --> 00:15:05.650
a reference to the
mass of the universe.

00:15:05.650 --> 00:15:07.220
It's a science equation.

00:15:07.220 --> 00:15:11.020
That's an equation that relates
to the mass of the Higgs boson,

00:15:11.020 --> 00:15:13.690
mass h 0.

00:15:13.690 --> 00:15:15.430
And if you work
that out, you find

00:15:15.430 --> 00:15:17.365
that that predicts a
mass that, I think,

00:15:17.365 --> 00:15:19.680
is about double the actual
mass of the Higgs boson.

00:15:19.680 --> 00:15:21.120
But that's not bad.

00:15:21.120 --> 00:15:23.290
This was happening 15
years before the Higgs

00:15:23.290 --> 00:15:26.230
was even discovered.

00:15:26.230 --> 00:15:28.820
In terms of mathematics,
you get a topology reference

00:15:28.820 --> 00:15:34.370
down here about the reshaping
of doughnuts into spheres.

00:15:34.370 --> 00:15:37.841
But you have to nibble at
them rather than twist them.

00:15:37.841 --> 00:15:40.040
But the one that really
caught my eye-- and this

00:15:40.040 --> 00:15:41.540
is the episode, I
think, that really

00:15:41.540 --> 00:15:44.870
got me interested in all of this
mathematics in "The Simpsons."

00:15:44.870 --> 00:15:48.259
This equation here-- a
number to the 12th power

00:15:48.259 --> 00:15:49.800
plus another number
to the 12th power

00:15:49.800 --> 00:15:53.010
equals another number
to the 12th power.

00:15:53.010 --> 00:15:57.680
Now that caught my eye
because the first book

00:15:57.680 --> 00:16:02.450
that I wrote in the UK was
called "Fermat's Last Theorem."

00:16:02.450 --> 00:16:05.184
In the US, it was called
"Fermat's Enigma."

00:16:05.184 --> 00:16:07.350
And it's all about this
chap here, Pierre de Fermat,

00:16:07.350 --> 00:16:08.641
who was a French mathematician.

00:16:08.641 --> 00:16:11.180
Very, very quickly I'll
tell you the story.

00:16:11.180 --> 00:16:13.660
He was studying an ancient
Greek text one day,

00:16:13.660 --> 00:16:16.190
the Arithmetica by Diophantus.

00:16:16.190 --> 00:16:18.340
And Diophantus
talked about the fact

00:16:18.340 --> 00:16:23.240
that there are lots of solutions
to the Pythagorean equation,

00:16:23.240 --> 00:16:26.370
x squared plus y squared
equals z squared.

00:16:26.370 --> 00:16:28.890
3 squared plus 4 squared
equals 5 squared.

00:16:28.890 --> 00:16:31.450
5 squared plus 12 squared
equals 13 squared.

00:16:31.450 --> 00:16:33.730
There are lots of
solutions to that equation.

00:16:33.730 --> 00:16:36.350
There are an infinite number
of solutions, in fact.

00:16:36.350 --> 00:16:38.550
But Fermat wondered what
happens if you increase

00:16:38.550 --> 00:16:41.170
the power to something
bigger than two.

00:16:41.170 --> 00:16:44.950
So for example, x to the power
of 3 plus y to the power of 3

00:16:44.950 --> 00:16:48.890
equals z to the power of 3,
or any power bigger than 2.

00:16:48.890 --> 00:16:53.360
Can you find any solutions
to any of those equations?

00:16:53.360 --> 00:16:56.470
Now, Pierre de Fermat
claimed that he

00:16:56.470 --> 00:16:58.380
could prove, without
a shadow of a doubt,

00:16:58.380 --> 00:17:00.010
that there were no solutions.

00:17:00.010 --> 00:17:01.640
He wrote in the
margin of his book,

00:17:01.640 --> 00:17:05.020
"I have a truly marvelous
proof of this fact.

00:17:05.020 --> 00:17:08.319
I have a demonstrationum
mirabilum.

00:17:08.319 --> 00:17:12.619
But this margin is too
narrow to contain that proof.

00:17:12.619 --> 00:17:15.829
Hanc marginis
exiguitas non caperet."

00:17:15.829 --> 00:17:17.400
And then he dropped dead.

00:17:17.400 --> 00:17:19.265
I Or a few years
later he dropped dead.

00:17:19.265 --> 00:17:20.890
People found the
book, they said, well,

00:17:20.890 --> 00:17:24.970
Fermat says he can prove these
equations have no solutions.

00:17:24.970 --> 00:17:26.960
But he doesn't tell
us what that proof is.

00:17:26.960 --> 00:17:30.460
And for 350 years, everybody
tries to rediscover the proof.

00:17:30.460 --> 00:17:32.370
Eventually a chap
called Sir Andrew Wiles

00:17:32.370 --> 00:17:33.860
rediscovers the proof.

00:17:33.860 --> 00:17:37.030
And we now know for a fact
that none of these equations

00:17:37.030 --> 00:17:39.380
have any solutions.

00:17:39.380 --> 00:17:42.670
So you will never find a
12 power plus a 12 power

00:17:42.670 --> 00:17:44.580
equalling a 12 power.

00:17:44.580 --> 00:17:48.660
And yet that's what
Homer gives us here.

00:17:48.660 --> 00:17:50.720
And if you check that,
if you've got a phone,

00:17:50.720 --> 00:17:54.670
you check it on your phone
calculator, that works.

00:17:54.670 --> 00:17:59.330
So Homer is defying
Andrew Wiles,

00:17:59.330 --> 00:18:01.150
he's defying Pierre
de Fermat, because he

00:18:01.150 --> 00:18:04.000
has found a solution
that seems to work.

00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:07.180
Now why does it seem to work?

00:18:07.180 --> 00:18:11.830
Well if you calculate
it more accurately,

00:18:11.830 --> 00:18:14.250
it's what's called a
near-miss solution,

00:18:14.250 --> 00:18:16.800
because the actual
solution is the following.

00:18:16.800 --> 00:18:22.000
It's not 4472, but
4472.000000 dedede dah.

00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:23.600
So it's called a
near-miss solution.

00:18:23.600 --> 00:18:25.500
It's a solution
that will fool you.

00:18:25.500 --> 00:18:28.240
It's a solution that will
fool your calculators.

00:18:28.240 --> 00:18:30.470
But if you've got a
precise calculator, one

00:18:30.470 --> 00:18:32.990
with a proper long
display, you can find out

00:18:32.990 --> 00:18:34.370
that it's a near-miss error.

00:18:34.370 --> 00:18:37.160
So again this is a lovely
example of one of the writers,

00:18:37.160 --> 00:18:40.050
in this case, David
X. Cohen, going

00:18:40.050 --> 00:18:42.990
to the trouble of putting
something in the back of shot,

00:18:42.990 --> 00:18:46.980
a little gag, a little reference
the lovers of mathematics

00:18:46.980 --> 00:18:51.115
will spot, will be annoyed by,
and then will have resolved.

00:18:51.115 --> 00:18:51.990
So it's just a prank.

00:18:51.990 --> 00:18:56.670
It's just a prank for
those who love mathematics.

00:18:56.670 --> 00:19:02.150
And there's tons-- I'll just see
how we're doing for time here.

00:19:02.150 --> 00:19:04.020
I mean there is tons more.

00:19:04.020 --> 00:19:06.560
There's another reference
of Fermat's Last Theorem

00:19:06.560 --> 00:19:08.950
in "Tree House of Horror
VI." "Treehouse of Horror VI"

00:19:08.950 --> 00:19:11.610
also has references to
Cartesian coordinates,

00:19:11.610 --> 00:19:15.790
has references to p versus np,
that great unsolved problem.

00:19:15.790 --> 00:19:18.600
It has references to
Euler's equation again,

00:19:18.600 --> 00:19:20.090
has references to
the Utah teapot.

00:19:20.090 --> 00:19:22.070
It has stuff in ASCII.

00:19:22.070 --> 00:19:23.824
There's so much
in "The Simpsons"

00:19:23.824 --> 00:19:25.990
that you could write a whole
book about it, in fact.

00:19:29.320 --> 00:19:31.860
So rather than go on about
"The Simpsons" further,

00:19:31.860 --> 00:19:35.820
I did want to talk about
"Futurama," because "Futurama"

00:19:35.820 --> 00:19:38.270
is the sister series
of "The Simpsons"

00:19:38.270 --> 00:19:44.255
and it has just as much
mathematics as "The Simpsons."

00:19:44.255 --> 00:19:46.510
The story here is
that, in the mid '90s,

00:19:46.510 --> 00:19:48.880
Fox could see that "The
Simpsons" was a huge success

00:19:48.880 --> 00:19:51.380
and they asked Matt Groening
to come up with something else.

00:19:51.380 --> 00:19:53.730
He came up with Futurama.

00:19:53.730 --> 00:19:57.950
He worked with David X.
Cohen to develop the idea.

00:19:57.950 --> 00:20:01.760
And David is one of
the guiding lights

00:20:01.760 --> 00:20:05.130
of the series, worked
on it ever since.

00:20:05.130 --> 00:20:07.740
And he's a
mathematician at heart.

00:20:07.740 --> 00:20:10.139
I think he studied
physics at Harvard

00:20:10.139 --> 00:20:11.680
then did computer
science, a master's

00:20:11.680 --> 00:20:13.400
in computer science at Berkeley.

00:20:13.400 --> 00:20:17.220
And has then written
mathematical papers.

00:20:17.220 --> 00:20:18.390
And he loves mathematics.

00:20:18.390 --> 00:20:20.410
He's put mathematics
into "The Simpsons"

00:20:20.410 --> 00:20:21.870
and he's going to
put mathematics

00:20:21.870 --> 00:20:23.730
into "Futurama" as well.

00:20:23.730 --> 00:20:26.660
And he was also keen to
recruit mathematicians

00:20:26.660 --> 00:20:28.750
to join the "Futurama"
writing team.

00:20:28.750 --> 00:20:31.090
It was quite important
not to poach writers

00:20:31.090 --> 00:20:33.570
from "The Simpsons," so
new writers came on board.

00:20:33.570 --> 00:20:38.240
People like Ken Keeler, who has
a PhD in applied mathematics.

00:20:38.240 --> 00:20:40.380
People like Jeff
Westbrook, who was

00:20:40.380 --> 00:20:42.790
a professor at Yale University.

00:20:42.790 --> 00:20:45.750
So you had new mathematicians
coming to join "Futurama,"

00:20:45.750 --> 00:20:49.560
working with David X. Cohen to
create a series which was also

00:20:49.560 --> 00:20:53.050
going to have tons
of mathematics in it.

00:20:53.050 --> 00:20:56.430
This is a picture of Ken Keeler.

00:20:56.430 --> 00:20:59.430
It's not the greatest
picture of Ken Keeler.

00:20:59.430 --> 00:21:01.540
But it's of great
historical importance,

00:21:01.540 --> 00:21:04.770
because this relates
to an episode called

00:21:04.770 --> 00:21:09.470
"The Prisoner of Benda," where
Professor Farnsworth invents

00:21:09.470 --> 00:21:11.300
a mind-switching machine.

00:21:11.300 --> 00:21:15.206
And everybody starts switching
minds left, right, and center.

00:21:15.206 --> 00:21:16.830
And at the end of
the episode everybody

00:21:16.830 --> 00:21:19.920
gets bored and wants to get
back to their original minds.

00:21:19.920 --> 00:21:23.170
But the mind-switching machine,
once two people have swapped,

00:21:23.170 --> 00:21:25.600
they cannot swap back.

00:21:25.600 --> 00:21:31.160
So the question is this--
given any number of people,

00:21:31.160 --> 00:21:35.410
given any amount
of mind switching,

00:21:35.410 --> 00:21:38.660
is there a way to guarantee
that everybody can get back

00:21:38.660 --> 00:21:40.460
to their original minds?

00:21:40.460 --> 00:21:44.490
And Ken Keeler developed
a little theorem.

00:21:44.490 --> 00:21:46.180
And he's very
modest about it, he

00:21:46.180 --> 00:21:48.180
doesn't think it's a great
piece of mathematics.

00:21:48.180 --> 00:21:50.502
But it's an interesting,
fun piece of mathematics.

00:21:50.502 --> 00:21:52.585
And this is him scribbling
it up on the whiteboard

00:21:52.585 --> 00:21:54.050
in the Futurama
offices, which is

00:21:54.050 --> 00:21:56.330
why it's of great
historical significance.

00:21:56.330 --> 00:21:58.810
But he was able to
prove that, regardless

00:21:58.810 --> 00:22:00.740
of the size of the
switching, regardless

00:22:00.740 --> 00:22:04.730
of the number of switching, if
you introduce two fresh bodies

00:22:04.730 --> 00:22:08.530
into the room, they provide
you with enough wriggle room

00:22:08.530 --> 00:22:14.420
for everybody else to
get back to their bodies.

00:22:14.420 --> 00:22:16.980
So, and I just wanted
to mention this

00:22:16.980 --> 00:22:21.210
because this is the only example
in the history of television

00:22:21.210 --> 00:22:25.030
of a writer creating a
bespoke theorem in order

00:22:25.030 --> 00:22:26.102
to complete a plot.

00:22:26.102 --> 00:22:27.810
So that's the extent
of the kind of stuff

00:22:27.810 --> 00:22:30.690
that goes on in "Futurama."

00:22:30.690 --> 00:22:34.130
I'll just give you one
example from "Futurama,"

00:22:34.130 --> 00:22:37.630
which is the number 1729.

00:22:37.630 --> 00:22:39.680
1729 crops up in "Futurama."

00:22:39.680 --> 00:22:44.000
It crops up as the hull registry
number of the Nimbus spaceship.

00:22:44.000 --> 00:22:48.440
It crops up also as
Bender's unit number.

00:22:48.440 --> 00:22:51.810
Bender the alcoholic robot.

00:22:51.810 --> 00:22:54.770
It crops up in "The
Farnsworth Parabox"

00:22:54.770 --> 00:22:58.590
as one of the universities
that's featured.

00:22:58.590 --> 00:23:00.570
So 1729 keeps cropping up.

00:23:00.570 --> 00:23:04.110
If it was just the hull registry
number, OK, we can ignore it.

00:23:04.110 --> 00:23:06.270
But the fact it
keeps cropping up

00:23:06.270 --> 00:23:09.540
means that it must have some
mathematical significance,

00:23:09.540 --> 00:23:12.260
given the fact we have Ken
Keeler and David X Cohen

00:23:12.260 --> 00:23:16.230
and Jeff Westbrook
working on this team.

00:23:16.230 --> 00:23:18.800
And one reason why
1729 is special

00:23:18.800 --> 00:23:22.240
is that it's called
a Harshad number.

00:23:22.240 --> 00:23:26.450
And Harshad numbers
have this odd property.

00:23:26.450 --> 00:23:29.150
If you take the digits
of 1729 and add them up,

00:23:29.150 --> 00:23:31.250
they come to 19.

00:23:31.250 --> 00:23:35.310
And 19 divides into 1729.

00:23:35.310 --> 00:23:38.180
And that's all it has to
be, to be a Harshad number.

00:23:38.180 --> 00:23:41.200
What's particularly
special about 1729 is,

00:23:41.200 --> 00:23:47.170
if you reverse 19, you get
the other factor of 1729.

00:23:47.170 --> 00:23:49.140
Yeah.

00:23:49.140 --> 00:23:51.880
That always gets an ooh, that
does, that always gets an ooh.

00:23:54.394 --> 00:23:56.310
So it's a very special
type of Harshad number,

00:23:56.310 --> 00:23:57.726
but in fact there
are four numbers

00:23:57.726 --> 00:23:59.300
that exhibit this property.

00:23:59.300 --> 00:24:01.310
So it's special but
not special enough

00:24:01.310 --> 00:24:04.930
to justify being cited so
many times in "Futurama."

00:24:04.930 --> 00:24:09.470
And the real reason why
1729 keeps cropping up

00:24:09.470 --> 00:24:11.350
is because of this
gentleman here.

00:24:11.350 --> 00:24:15.920
This is Srinivasa
Ramanujan, arguably

00:24:15.920 --> 00:24:18.420
the most talented
or naturally gifted

00:24:18.420 --> 00:24:21.070
mathematician of
the 20th century.

00:24:21.070 --> 00:24:24.560
He grew up in southern India,
was from a very poor family--

00:24:24.560 --> 00:24:27.300
I think his three siblings
all died in infancy.

00:24:27.300 --> 00:24:30.330
He suffered from
smallpox but survived.

00:24:30.330 --> 00:24:34.040
His family just about managed
to give him a basic education.

00:24:34.040 --> 00:24:36.970
He couldn't get to university,
couldn't get to college,

00:24:36.970 --> 00:24:38.840
but still he would
study mathematics

00:24:38.840 --> 00:24:40.440
by going to the library.

00:24:40.440 --> 00:24:44.050
And he'd pick out books
and study the mathematics

00:24:44.050 --> 00:24:45.410
within them.

00:24:45.410 --> 00:24:47.480
And pretty soon he
wasn't just studying

00:24:47.480 --> 00:24:49.440
the mathematics
in these books, he

00:24:49.440 --> 00:24:52.740
was creating new
mathematics, new theorems.

00:24:52.740 --> 00:24:54.910
And eventually he
had a whole package

00:24:54.910 --> 00:24:58.170
of these, about 120
theorems that he'd created.

00:24:58.170 --> 00:25:00.970
And nobody could understand
what he was doing.

00:25:00.970 --> 00:25:04.670
And so he sent them to
a professor, GH Hardy,

00:25:04.670 --> 00:25:07.100
in Cambridge, England.

00:25:07.100 --> 00:25:10.670
And they arrived
on Hardy's desk.

00:25:10.670 --> 00:25:12.270
And Hardy was blown away.

00:25:12.270 --> 00:25:15.050
He couldn't believe what
had appeared out of nowhere

00:25:15.050 --> 00:25:19.000
from an unknown mathematician
on the other side of the planet.

00:25:19.000 --> 00:25:21.650
And his immediate
reaction was to invite

00:25:21.650 --> 00:25:23.930
Ramanujan to come to Cambridge.

00:25:23.930 --> 00:25:27.710
And GH Hardy was a
formidable mathematician.

00:25:27.710 --> 00:25:31.250
He's credited with galvanizing
English mathematics

00:25:31.250 --> 00:25:33.790
at a time when English
mathematics was in the doldrums

00:25:33.790 --> 00:25:35.100
compared to France and Germany.

00:25:35.100 --> 00:25:39.400
So he really was spearheading
British mathematics.

00:25:39.400 --> 00:25:41.650
And yet, he said, if there's
only one great thing I've

00:25:41.650 --> 00:25:45.860
done in my life, it was to
bring Ramanujan over to England.

00:25:45.860 --> 00:25:49.720
Because when he came to
Cambridge, he flourished.

00:25:49.720 --> 00:25:52.800
His genius was recognized.

00:25:52.800 --> 00:25:55.880
He became a Fellow of the Royal
Society-- one of the youngest

00:25:55.880 --> 00:25:57.610
Fellows of the Royal Society.

00:25:57.610 --> 00:25:59.360
He became the first
Indian to become

00:25:59.360 --> 00:26:02.670
a Fellow of Trinity
College, Cambridge.

00:26:02.670 --> 00:26:06.730
And his mathematical
potential was being fulfilled.

00:26:06.730 --> 00:26:10.280
Sadly, however, physically,
he was really suffering.

00:26:10.280 --> 00:26:13.650
The cold weather
really hurt him.

00:26:13.650 --> 00:26:16.340
He was a strict vegetarian,
he was a strict Hindu,

00:26:16.340 --> 00:26:20.210
so the diet didn't
really suit him either.

00:26:20.210 --> 00:26:23.790
He came down with
tuberculosis, eventually.

00:26:23.790 --> 00:26:26.790
And he went back
to India and died

00:26:26.790 --> 00:26:30.630
in his 30s, tragically young.

00:26:30.630 --> 00:26:34.195
But just before we went back
to India, when he was ill

00:26:34.195 --> 00:26:37.140
he was in a nursing home
in Putney in South London.

00:26:37.140 --> 00:26:39.070
And Hardy went to visit him.

00:26:39.070 --> 00:26:41.140
And Hardy took a train
from Cambridge to London,

00:26:41.140 --> 00:26:44.480
took a taxi from the
station to the nursing home,

00:26:44.480 --> 00:26:48.830
went into the hospital,
sat next to Ramanujan.

00:26:48.830 --> 00:26:51.770
And, struggling to
make conversation,

00:26:51.770 --> 00:26:54.530
perhaps, Ramanujan
said, what was

00:26:54.530 --> 00:26:56.660
the name of the
taxi you came in?

00:26:56.660 --> 00:27:01.940
And Hardy said it wasn't very
interesting, it was just 1729.

00:27:01.940 --> 00:27:03.560
And Ramanujan said, 1729?

00:27:03.560 --> 00:27:05.790
No, that is a really
interesting number.

00:27:05.790 --> 00:27:09.880
It's an interesting number
because 1729 is the smallest

00:27:09.880 --> 00:27:16.110
number that's the sum of two
cubes in two different ways.

00:27:16.110 --> 00:27:18.550
Let me just unpack that.

00:27:18.550 --> 00:27:22.175
1729 is 10 cubed plus 9 cubed.

00:27:22.175 --> 00:27:24.430
Now most numbers aren't
the sum of two cubes,

00:27:24.430 --> 00:27:26.220
so that's interesting.

00:27:26.220 --> 00:27:30.650
1729 is also the sum of
12 cubed plus 1 cubed.

00:27:30.650 --> 00:27:32.660
Very few numbers are
the sum of two cubes

00:27:32.660 --> 00:27:34.860
in two different ways.

00:27:34.860 --> 00:27:36.634
And this is the
smallest number that

00:27:36.634 --> 00:27:38.550
is the sum of two cubes
in two different ways.

00:27:38.550 --> 00:27:40.060
And Ramanujan just knew that.

00:27:40.060 --> 00:27:41.730
He just plucked
that from thin air.

00:27:41.730 --> 00:27:45.330
He had a natural
understanding of numbers.

00:27:45.330 --> 00:27:48.300
He used to say that at
night, while he was asleep,

00:27:48.300 --> 00:27:51.190
one of the Hindu goddesses
would write mathematical truths

00:27:51.190 --> 00:27:55.040
on his tongue that would somehow
become absorbed into his brain.

00:27:55.040 --> 00:27:57.260
And he could just pluck
these things from thin air.

00:27:57.260 --> 00:28:00.650
And because it was one
of the last conversations

00:28:00.650 --> 00:28:03.030
that Ramanujan had before
he left to go back to India,

00:28:03.030 --> 00:28:04.787
and before he died,
that conversation

00:28:04.787 --> 00:28:06.820
has gone down in history.

00:28:06.820 --> 00:28:11.730
And 1729 has gone down
in mathematical folklore.

00:28:11.730 --> 00:28:15.140
And that's why it keeps on
appearing in "Futurama."

00:28:15.140 --> 00:28:18.180
It's Ken Keeler's way
of just acknowledging

00:28:18.180 --> 00:28:21.300
this great genius, Ramanujan.

00:28:21.300 --> 00:28:23.130
And it's kind of
wonderful, I think,

00:28:23.130 --> 00:28:27.770
that Ramanujan, some 100 years
after he started corresponding

00:28:27.770 --> 00:28:30.680
with Hardy is
remembered in this way,

00:28:30.680 --> 00:28:34.490
in this sci-fi animated
sitcom called "Futurama."

00:28:34.490 --> 00:28:39.980
It doesn't just stop there,
because you can then ask, OK

00:28:39.980 --> 00:28:41.780
that number's the
smallest number that's

00:28:41.780 --> 00:28:44.220
the sum of two cubes
in two different ways.

00:28:44.220 --> 00:28:46.400
You can then ask, well
what number is the smallest

00:28:46.400 --> 00:28:50.690
one that's a sum of two cubes
in three different ways?

00:28:50.690 --> 00:28:52.440
And you end up with
an eight digit number,

00:28:52.440 --> 00:28:54.600
something extraordinary,
something like 83 million

00:28:54.600 --> 00:28:55.690
or something.

00:28:55.690 --> 00:28:59.410
But that number also
appears in "Futurama."

00:28:59.410 --> 00:29:02.120
It's called a taxicab
number of order 3,

00:29:02.120 --> 00:29:05.804
and it appears as a
taxicab number in Futurama.

00:29:05.804 --> 00:29:07.220
So I'm going to
stop there, but we

00:29:07.220 --> 00:29:10.250
do have 10 minutes,
or a bit more, even,

00:29:10.250 --> 00:29:12.420
if people have questions.

00:29:12.420 --> 00:29:14.832
I've skipped over lot
of things and may not

00:29:14.832 --> 00:29:16.540
have explained things
in complete detail.

00:29:16.540 --> 00:29:19.850
So if people have questions, I
think we have two microphones.

00:29:19.850 --> 00:29:22.449
I'm very happy to try and
answer as many as I can.

00:29:22.449 --> 00:29:23.490
AUDIENCE: Does this work?

00:29:23.490 --> 00:29:24.302
Yeah.

00:29:24.302 --> 00:29:25.744
Hey, awesome seeing you here.

00:29:25.744 --> 00:29:28.160
It's actually really awesome,
because I saw you on YouTube

00:29:28.160 --> 00:29:29.312
before, on Numberphile--

00:29:29.312 --> 00:29:30.270
SIMON SINGH: Oh, great!

00:29:30.270 --> 00:29:32.061
AUDIENCE: --talking
about Fermat's Theorem.

00:29:32.061 --> 00:29:34.130
So the question was, this
is really cool stuff,

00:29:34.130 --> 00:29:36.430
and can we look
forward to seeing

00:29:36.430 --> 00:29:40.170
more of this in a more popular
medium than closed rooms?

00:29:40.170 --> 00:29:42.810
SIMON SINGH: Oh, well, yeah.

00:29:42.810 --> 00:29:43.520
I hope so.

00:29:46.030 --> 00:29:49.170
The book's been published in
the UK for about two weeks now.

00:29:49.170 --> 00:29:53.325
And in the UK, the mainstream
press have picked up on it,

00:29:53.325 --> 00:29:54.700
radio shows have
picked up on it,

00:29:54.700 --> 00:29:56.750
the tabloid press
have picked up on it.

00:29:56.750 --> 00:30:00.060
There's something in the
Huffington Post today.

00:30:00.060 --> 00:30:03.440
So what's really nice is,
OK, this is a big thick book,

00:30:03.440 --> 00:30:06.120
and not many people
may buy the book.

00:30:06.120 --> 00:30:09.640
Not many people may
come to talks like this.

00:30:09.640 --> 00:30:12.290
But I think it'll
get disseminated

00:30:12.290 --> 00:30:14.750
through all these other media.

00:30:14.750 --> 00:30:17.110
And I think the writers
are really happy.

00:30:17.110 --> 00:30:20.560
I called the book "The
Simpsons and Their Mathematical

00:30:20.560 --> 00:30:23.850
Secrets," but it's
never been a secret.

00:30:23.850 --> 00:30:26.152
The writers have never
tried to hide this.

00:30:26.152 --> 00:30:27.610
They've just put
it in places where

00:30:27.610 --> 00:30:29.930
people might not
necessarily look.

00:30:29.930 --> 00:30:33.480
And I think they're really
pleased that people are now

00:30:33.480 --> 00:30:35.574
noticing this.

00:30:35.574 --> 00:30:36.990
I think one of the
reasons they do

00:30:36.990 --> 00:30:39.760
this is because they think
of themselves when they were

00:30:39.760 --> 00:30:43.620
teenagers and how they
loved mathematics.

00:30:43.620 --> 00:30:45.590
And maybe it was
hard for them to find

00:30:45.590 --> 00:30:50.030
ways to see other people
loving mathematics.

00:30:50.030 --> 00:30:51.462
And yet if you're
a teenager now,

00:30:51.462 --> 00:30:52.920
and you see "The
Simpsons," and you

00:30:52.920 --> 00:30:55.390
notice that there's a
narcissistic number on there,

00:30:55.390 --> 00:30:57.810
and you think, hang on,
the people writing this

00:30:57.810 --> 00:30:59.736
must love mathematics
as much as I do.

00:30:59.736 --> 00:31:01.360
And maybe it will
make them feel better

00:31:01.360 --> 00:31:03.770
about their love of mathematics.

00:31:03.770 --> 00:31:04.720
Thank you.

00:31:04.720 --> 00:31:05.428
AUDIENCE: Thanks.

00:31:07.809 --> 00:31:08.350
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:31:08.350 --> 00:31:10.050
I had a two part question.

00:31:10.050 --> 00:31:14.480
The first part is, I assume
that Matt Groening probably

00:31:14.480 --> 00:31:16.540
has a lot of support
for these kind of jokes

00:31:16.540 --> 00:31:19.400
and he gives them a
lot of encouragement.

00:31:19.400 --> 00:31:25.030
And then the second part is, why
don't other TV shows try and do

00:31:25.030 --> 00:31:26.170
the same thing?

00:31:26.170 --> 00:31:27.890
Seeing how popular
"The Simpsons" is.

00:31:27.890 --> 00:31:29.500
SIMON SINGH: Yes, I
get the impression

00:31:29.500 --> 00:31:31.680
that Matt Groening,
from the very start,

00:31:31.680 --> 00:31:33.896
gave writers the
freedom to express

00:31:33.896 --> 00:31:35.020
their particular interests.

00:31:35.020 --> 00:31:38.140
So, again from that very,
very first episode--

00:31:38.140 --> 00:31:41.630
I call it the first
episode, "Bart the Genius."

00:31:41.630 --> 00:31:44.490
Bart's having lunch and
one of the fellow students

00:31:44.490 --> 00:31:48.080
opens a lunch box, and it's
there for a split second.

00:31:48.080 --> 00:31:52.520
But if you look carefully, it's
an Anatoly Karpov lunch box.

00:31:52.520 --> 00:31:56.030
Anatoly Karpov was world chess
champion in the early '70s.

00:31:56.030 --> 00:31:58.480
Not many people would
necessarily know that.

00:31:58.480 --> 00:32:01.750
He was also a mathematician--
not many people know that.

00:32:01.750 --> 00:32:05.230
He also is responsible for
auctioning the most valuable

00:32:05.230 --> 00:32:07.250
stamp from the Belgian Congo.

00:32:07.250 --> 00:32:10.490
Not many people
know that either.

00:32:10.490 --> 00:32:14.840
So that kind of niche know--
But the fundamental rule was,

00:32:14.840 --> 00:32:17.520
these references must not
get in the way of the jokes,

00:32:17.520 --> 00:32:19.560
and they must not get
in the way of the plot.

00:32:19.560 --> 00:32:25.070
And so with the
googolplex joke reference,

00:32:25.070 --> 00:32:28.996
as I'm fairly sure Mike
Reiss came up with that,

00:32:28.996 --> 00:32:30.370
somebody around
the writing table

00:32:30.370 --> 00:32:32.040
said, yeah who's
going to get that?

00:32:32.040 --> 00:32:34.290
Nobody's heard of
what a googolplex is.

00:32:34.290 --> 00:32:37.224
And I think Mike Reiss
responded, well, yeah,

00:32:37.224 --> 00:32:38.640
maybe not many
people will get it,

00:32:38.640 --> 00:32:41.690
but how funny can you
make the name of a cinema?

00:32:41.690 --> 00:32:45.440
So you haven't lost anything,
and maybe you gain something.

00:32:45.440 --> 00:32:48.350
And then, why "The
Simpsons" and why

00:32:48.350 --> 00:32:56.170
"Futurama"-- I have a
chapter in the book about why

00:32:56.170 --> 00:32:58.880
mathematicians are
involved in comedy.

00:32:58.880 --> 00:33:01.450
And there are lots of them,
not just within "The Simpsons."

00:33:01.450 --> 00:33:04.870
But we have people in the
UK, people like Dave Gorman,

00:33:04.870 --> 00:33:06.910
people like Dara O Briain.

00:33:06.910 --> 00:33:09.900
Tom Lehrer, the finest musical
satirist of the 20th century.

00:33:13.272 --> 00:33:15.230
There is a link between
mathematics and comedy,

00:33:15.230 --> 00:33:16.990
and I talk about
that in the book.

00:33:16.990 --> 00:33:20.986
But then I think
I asked Al Jean,

00:33:20.986 --> 00:33:24.169
but why have you all
congregated here?

00:33:24.169 --> 00:33:25.960
And there are a couple
of reasons for that.

00:33:25.960 --> 00:33:30.560
But I think the most interesting
one was, Al Jean said that when

00:33:30.560 --> 00:33:33.040
you do mathematics-- and
he made a distinction

00:33:33.040 --> 00:33:36.880
between mathematics, and
science, and everything else.

00:33:36.880 --> 00:33:39.202
And maybe with computer
science as well.

00:33:39.202 --> 00:33:40.910
That in mathematics
and computer science,

00:33:40.910 --> 00:33:44.640
whatever you write down happens.

00:33:44.640 --> 00:33:47.670
Whatever line of logic you write
down, the next line of logic

00:33:47.670 --> 00:33:48.170
flows.

00:33:48.170 --> 00:33:51.740
You are in complete control
of what you are doing.

00:33:51.740 --> 00:33:54.310
As a mathematician and
as a computer scientist.

00:33:54.310 --> 00:33:55.160
You are in control.

00:33:58.690 --> 00:34:02.370
Whereas science is messy,
and equipment breaks,

00:34:02.370 --> 00:34:05.070
and the weather gets
in the way, and you

00:34:05.070 --> 00:34:06.690
don't have enough statistics.

00:34:06.690 --> 00:34:09.187
So maths is pure
and perfect, science

00:34:09.187 --> 00:34:11.860
is impure and imperfect.

00:34:11.860 --> 00:34:14.340
Animation is pure and perfect.

00:34:14.340 --> 00:34:16.889
What you write in your
script will be read.

00:34:16.889 --> 00:34:20.570
What you draw on your storyboard
will appear on screen.

00:34:20.570 --> 00:34:22.906
Whereas with live action
comedy, again, you're

00:34:22.906 --> 00:34:25.239
dealing with the weather,
you're dealing with directors,

00:34:25.239 --> 00:34:27.770
you're dealing with
actors and so on.

00:34:27.770 --> 00:34:29.810
So he drew the
parallel-- I think

00:34:29.810 --> 00:34:32.480
his line was, he said that
animation is a mathematician's

00:34:32.480 --> 00:34:33.440
medium.

00:34:33.440 --> 00:34:35.750
So maybe that explains why.

00:34:35.750 --> 00:34:36.581
Yeah

00:34:36.581 --> 00:34:38.080
AUDIENCE: Sorry to
break the format.

00:34:38.080 --> 00:34:40.030
This is not a question,
but just an observation.

00:34:40.030 --> 00:34:42.655
I wanted to take the opportunity
to say thank you for your work

00:34:42.655 --> 00:34:47.219
with the protecting the right
of authors and individuals

00:34:47.219 --> 00:34:48.940
to present their opinions.

00:34:48.940 --> 00:34:51.848
The Defamation Act this year,
and of course, the BCA lawsuit.

00:34:51.848 --> 00:34:52.389
So thank you.

00:34:52.389 --> 00:34:53.989
SIMON SINGH: Thank
you very much.

00:34:53.989 --> 00:34:56.179
Just a bit of background
in case people don't know.

00:34:56.179 --> 00:34:59.420
But I mean, people like
to think of England

00:34:59.420 --> 00:35:05.100
as a kind of land of justice
and fairness and free speech.

00:35:05.100 --> 00:35:08.000
But we still actually
have, as of today,

00:35:08.000 --> 00:35:10.396
really quite harsh libel laws.

00:35:10.396 --> 00:35:12.520
People from all over the
world would come to London

00:35:12.520 --> 00:35:14.080
to sue for libel.

00:35:14.080 --> 00:35:15.810
It was the libel
capital of the world.

00:35:15.810 --> 00:35:18.010
You'd end up with
Danish newspapers

00:35:18.010 --> 00:35:20.330
being sued by Icelandic banks.

00:35:20.330 --> 00:35:22.750
Ukrainian oligarchs suing
Ukrainian newspapers.

00:35:22.750 --> 00:35:23.780
All in London.

00:35:23.780 --> 00:35:24.630
Ridiculous.

00:35:24.630 --> 00:35:28.710
Saudi billionaire sued a
New York author in London.

00:35:28.710 --> 00:35:31.967
And it got so bad that
your President actually

00:35:31.967 --> 00:35:34.050
brought in a law that said,
if you're an American,

00:35:34.050 --> 00:35:37.420
you get sued in London,
your assets are safe.

00:35:37.420 --> 00:35:39.450
Because we have
so little respect

00:35:39.450 --> 00:35:41.759
for English law
in terms of libel.

00:35:41.759 --> 00:35:43.800
And that was really
important because it actually

00:35:43.800 --> 00:35:46.280
helped us begin to
change our laws.

00:35:46.280 --> 00:35:49.310
I got sued for libel, as
did a few other people who

00:35:49.310 --> 00:35:52.842
were science writers,
health writers.

00:35:52.842 --> 00:35:54.550
And people just thought
it was ridiculous

00:35:54.550 --> 00:35:57.840
that you can't write about
science without being

00:35:57.840 --> 00:35:59.170
sued for libel.

00:35:59.170 --> 00:36:00.062
It was ridiculous.

00:36:00.062 --> 00:36:01.520
In science, the
way we move forward

00:36:01.520 --> 00:36:03.270
in science, and
many other areas,

00:36:03.270 --> 00:36:05.960
is through robust
argument and debate.

00:36:05.960 --> 00:36:08.800
Anyway it took a few years,
but eventually, we now

00:36:08.800 --> 00:36:11.650
have a new defamation
act, Defamation Act 2013,

00:36:11.650 --> 00:36:14.434
which is much more reasonable.

00:36:14.434 --> 00:36:16.600
And that will become law,
literally in the next week

00:36:16.600 --> 00:36:18.540
or two.

00:36:18.540 --> 00:36:20.440
And what was really
great about that was,

00:36:20.440 --> 00:36:23.150
it was very much a
grassroots campaign.

00:36:23.150 --> 00:36:25.410
Because bloggers were
getting sued for libel,

00:36:25.410 --> 00:36:28.130
getting threatened with libel.

00:36:28.130 --> 00:36:31.290
Local newspapers,
online newsgroups.

00:36:31.290 --> 00:36:34.080
We have an organization in
Britain called Mumsnet, where

00:36:34.080 --> 00:36:35.614
parents share their experiences.

00:36:35.614 --> 00:36:37.280
They were getting
threatened with libel.

00:36:37.280 --> 00:36:39.180
It was ridiculous.

00:36:39.180 --> 00:36:43.170
The only problem left,
once this law becomes law

00:36:43.170 --> 00:36:46.160
in the next week or two,
is Northern Ireland.

00:36:46.160 --> 00:36:51.030
Because Northern Ireland still
isn't updating its laws yet.

00:36:51.030 --> 00:36:54.190
And that could become the new
libel capital of the world.

00:36:54.190 --> 00:36:57.450
So you might find yourself
being dragged to Belfast

00:36:57.450 --> 00:36:59.810
if you say something which
somebody doesn't like.

00:36:59.810 --> 00:37:01.715
But thank you very
much, thank you.

00:37:01.715 --> 00:37:04.090
AUDIENCE: That guy kind of
stole my thunder a little bit.

00:37:06.810 --> 00:37:09.220
Thanks for coming and
I've read all your books.

00:37:09.220 --> 00:37:11.560
I read "The Code Book" twice.

00:37:11.560 --> 00:37:12.920
Great book.

00:37:12.920 --> 00:37:15.410
But I think the most
important book you've written,

00:37:15.410 --> 00:37:18.820
in my humble opinion,
is "Trick or Treatment."

00:37:18.820 --> 00:37:22.850
if I was king of the world,
I'd make everyone read it.

00:37:22.850 --> 00:37:25.860
And I'm curious to
know, are you still

00:37:25.860 --> 00:37:28.430
active in the science-based
medicine community?

00:37:28.430 --> 00:37:31.912
Do you do anything, are there
any plans to update that book?

00:37:31.912 --> 00:37:34.370
SIMON SINGH: Yeah, thank you
very much for your kind words.

00:37:39.030 --> 00:37:41.330
So my backgrounds in physics.

00:37:41.330 --> 00:37:43.355
That's what I study,
that's what I love.

00:37:43.355 --> 00:37:45.730
Maths is kind of the same kind
of thing, so I love maths.

00:37:45.730 --> 00:37:47.540
I love writing about that.

00:37:47.540 --> 00:37:51.170
But I ended up writing this
book about alternative medicine

00:37:51.170 --> 00:37:52.950
because-- couple of reasons.

00:37:52.950 --> 00:37:56.300
One was, I had
heard about students

00:37:56.300 --> 00:37:58.820
going on their gap years.

00:37:58.820 --> 00:38:01.170
Before going to college,
they'd travel around the world.

00:38:01.170 --> 00:38:03.710
And they would use homeopathy
to protect themselves

00:38:03.710 --> 00:38:05.045
against malaria.

00:38:05.045 --> 00:38:06.680
And I couldn't
believe this was true

00:38:06.680 --> 00:38:09.770
so I asked a young student
to go to 10 homeopaths.

00:38:09.770 --> 00:38:12.310
And she said, I don't like
using conventional treatment.

00:38:12.310 --> 00:38:14.740
Can you give me something
that I can use instead?

00:38:14.740 --> 00:38:16.960
And 10 out of 10
homeopaths said, here,

00:38:16.960 --> 00:38:18.650
use these sugar pills.

00:38:18.650 --> 00:38:20.150
And her story was
that she was going

00:38:20.150 --> 00:38:22.580
to go to West
Africa for 10 weeks

00:38:22.580 --> 00:38:25.600
on a truck tour, where there
are strains of malaria that

00:38:25.600 --> 00:38:27.580
will kill you within three days.

00:38:27.580 --> 00:38:30.770
And there are examples of
people that use homeopathy

00:38:30.770 --> 00:38:33.330
and who came back to Europe
and suffered multiple organ

00:38:33.330 --> 00:38:35.280
failure because
of severe malaria.

00:38:35.280 --> 00:38:40.500
So I was shocked that
fairly bright young people

00:38:40.500 --> 00:38:42.460
were being taken
in by homeopathy.

00:38:42.460 --> 00:38:45.720
So I sat down with a professor
of complementary medicine,

00:38:45.720 --> 00:38:47.650
in fact.

00:38:47.650 --> 00:38:50.930
But a very rigorous
scientist, what

00:38:50.930 --> 00:38:58.290
we call evidence-based
medicine is what he follows.

00:38:58.290 --> 00:39:00.270
And so he's been examining
alternative medicine

00:39:00.270 --> 00:39:02.700
for the last 10 years.

00:39:02.700 --> 00:39:05.270
And the alternative
therapists hate him.

00:39:05.270 --> 00:39:08.020
Because sometimes he finds
something that works,

00:39:08.020 --> 00:39:10.460
and he'll say that, because
he's a good scientist.

00:39:10.460 --> 00:39:12.294
But often he'll find
things that don't work,

00:39:12.294 --> 00:39:14.043
which aren't backed
by evidence, and which

00:39:14.043 --> 00:39:15.300
might even be dangerous.

00:39:15.300 --> 00:39:18.404
So the alternative
therapists hate him.

00:39:18.404 --> 00:39:19.820
He was the world's
first professor

00:39:19.820 --> 00:39:21.278
of complementary
medicine, and they

00:39:21.278 --> 00:39:24.520
said, if you're a professor
of complementary medicine,

00:39:24.520 --> 00:39:27.600
you should be championing
complementary medicine.

00:39:27.600 --> 00:39:30.420
And he says, well, look, if I
was a professor of toxicology,

00:39:30.420 --> 00:39:33.060
I wouldn't be
championing toxins.

00:39:33.060 --> 00:39:35.725
It's not how it works.

00:39:35.725 --> 00:39:40.877
So he and I, we
wrote a book which

00:39:40.877 --> 00:39:42.960
looked at all the different
alternative therapies.

00:39:42.960 --> 00:39:44.715
And one or two of them
work, and we say that,

00:39:44.715 --> 00:39:45.720
and most of them don't.

00:39:45.720 --> 00:39:47.462
Some of them are
particularly dangerous.

00:39:47.462 --> 00:39:49.670
It was after writing that
book that I wrote something

00:39:49.670 --> 00:39:52.480
in a newspaper that that's
why I got sued for libel.

00:39:52.480 --> 00:39:56.420
And I still occasionally write
about alternative medicine

00:39:56.420 --> 00:39:59.510
and support one
or two groups that

00:39:59.510 --> 00:40:03.390
are involved in challenging
alternative medicine.

00:40:03.390 --> 00:40:06.960
So for example, right now
we've got a horrendous magazine

00:40:06.960 --> 00:40:11.670
in Britain called "What
Doctors Don't Tell You,"

00:40:11.670 --> 00:40:13.340
and you can buy it
in your supermarket,

00:40:13.340 --> 00:40:17.640
you can buy it at
newspaper outlets.

00:40:17.640 --> 00:40:21.560
And it essentially says that
doctors have got secrets

00:40:21.560 --> 00:40:22.920
that they're not telling you.

00:40:22.920 --> 00:40:27.620
And we're going to tell
you the real truth.

00:40:27.620 --> 00:40:30.650
And it's just full of clap
trap, and dangerous clap trap.

00:40:30.650 --> 00:40:33.150
And people believe what's in it.

00:40:33.150 --> 00:40:37.970
So we're currently
talking to people to say--

00:40:37.970 --> 00:40:40.540
and again, I'm very
pro free speech.

00:40:40.540 --> 00:40:43.380
So if supermarkets want
to stock it and sell it,

00:40:43.380 --> 00:40:44.842
I can't stop them.

00:40:44.842 --> 00:40:47.170
And I shouldn't be able
to ban them from doing it.

00:40:47.170 --> 00:40:50.510
But I want these supermarkets
to know what they are selling.

00:40:50.510 --> 00:40:52.440
So that they're aware
that, if they generally

00:40:52.440 --> 00:40:54.780
have a policy of
promoting good health

00:40:54.780 --> 00:40:56.930
and supporting their
customers in giving them

00:40:56.930 --> 00:40:59.110
proper information,
then do they really

00:40:59.110 --> 00:41:00.920
want to be stocking
this magazine?

00:41:00.920 --> 00:41:01.755
That's their choice.

00:41:04.420 --> 00:41:06.390
But it's one that I would
caution them against.

00:41:06.390 --> 00:41:08.824
So I'm still involved with
those kind of campaigns

00:41:08.824 --> 00:41:09.865
and those kind of issues.

00:41:12.680 --> 00:41:14.037
So yes.

00:41:14.037 --> 00:41:15.120
Thank you very, very much.

00:41:15.120 --> 00:41:16.260
If people do have
more questions,

00:41:16.260 --> 00:41:17.670
I'm going to be here
for five or ten minutes.

00:41:17.670 --> 00:41:19.400
So please do come and say hello.

00:41:19.400 --> 00:41:20.990
And thank you very
much for coming.

00:41:20.990 --> 00:41:22.750
Thank you.
