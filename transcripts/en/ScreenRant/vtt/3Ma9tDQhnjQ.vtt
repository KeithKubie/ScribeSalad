10 Weirdest Movie Merchandise Ever Made

00:00:08.520 --> 00:00:11.170
It’s no secret that the world of movie merch
is a lucrative one for Hollywood, offering

00:00:11.170 --> 00:00:14.540
fans items or toys to take them right back
to their favorite movies.

00:00:14.540 --> 00:00:18.070
But some products on the market are a little
more questionable than others.

00:00:18.070 --> 00:00:20.690
Keep these in mind the next time the next
time you need gift inspiration for the movie

00:00:20.690 --> 00:00:21.690
buff in your life.

00:00:21.690 --> 00:00:26.500
Here are Screen Rant’s 10 Weirdest Movie
Merchandise Ever Made.

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:28.760
R2D2 Aquarium

00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:33.480
Star Wars is a merchandise juggernaut, spanning
the saga’s nearly 40 year legacy.

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:37.680
But when New York-based retailer Hammacher
Schlemmer got involved, fans weren’t sure

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:40.570
about their contribution to the merchandise
canon.

00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:44.770
Known for supplying an eclectic array of gadgetry,
the company prides itself on its weirdness.

00:00:44.770 --> 00:00:51.510
For only $79.95, collectors could own the
R2D2 Aquarium, which has since been removed

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:52.510
from their catalogue.

00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:56.800
The droid housed an almost two-gallon tank,
and included a built-in periscope for a different

00:00:56.800 --> 00:00:58.489
angle on the aquatic action.

00:00:58.489 --> 00:01:02.430
With all the color-changing lights, themed
backdrops, and voice-activated sound effects,

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:07.009
the aesthetic of this aquarium was designed
with humans in mind, not fish – which kind

00:01:07.009 --> 00:01:09.549
of defeats the purpose.

00:01:09.549 --> 00:01:10.710
James Bond Candles

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:16.659
The suits, booze, and cars all add to the
glamorous persona of James Bond, but one product

00:01:16.659 --> 00:01:17.659
goes a step further.

00:01:17.659 --> 00:01:22.560
In an attempt to capitalize on all aspects
of 007, clothing and lifestyle brand TOCCA

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:24.590
created the James Bond Candle.

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:28.720
For only $38, buyers can make their homes
smell just like Bond’s!

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:32.719
Inspired by his signature car and drink, the
candle’s marketed as having “rich, leathery

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:35.409
smell” reflective of Bond’s environment.

00:01:35.409 --> 00:01:39.490
Some fans may question just what the product
has to do with the star spy, but considering

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:44.939
how bankable the character has become, it’s
not surprising.

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:48.149
Harry Potter Vibrating Nimbus 2000

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:52.290
Toy manufacturer Mattel made quite a fuss
when they released a replica Nimbus 2000 from

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:54.100
the Harry Potter franchise.

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:58.689
Excited fans flocked to buy them, eager to
practice for Quidditch tryouts themselves.

00:01:58.689 --> 00:02:02.999
Marketed as a kids toy, the battery-operated
broomstick had a vibration feature, which

00:02:02.999 --> 00:02:04.609
normally wouldn’t be a big deal.

00:02:04.609 --> 00:02:07.819
But because of the nature and placement of
the broom, parents thought it was a little

00:02:07.819 --> 00:02:09.840
too adult.

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:12.760
The Nimbus was pulled from the shelves and
has since been replaced with a different,

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:15.340
non-vibrating model made by another manufacturer.

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:18.890
The original brooms are still flying around
on eBay, but because of their rarity, they

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:20.670
can cost upwards of $100.

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:22.750
Assembled The Avengers Cologne Set

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:27.990
Marvel’s Avengers are known for many things,
but how they smell isn’t one of them - until

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:28.990
NOW.

00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:33.030
The makers of The Avengers Cologne Set want
you to smell like your favorite superhero,

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:38.160
with fragrances inspired by Thor, Captain
America, Iron Man, and the Hulk sold individually

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:39.410
or as a set.

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:44.720
The idea comes from Jads International, who
released a similar line for Star Trek, but

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:46.470
this version makes even less sense.

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:49.710
It seems counter-intuitive to intentionally
smell like the inside of a sweaty suit of

00:02:49.710 --> 00:02:53.520
Iron Man armor, but according to the reviews,
Tony Stark’s scent is the fan favorite.

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:55.940
We can’t say we’re surprised.

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:58.910
The “Dark Vador” Burger

00:02:58.910 --> 00:03:02.650
Almost every fast food chain has paired up
with Hollywood marketing at some point, from

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:05.280
commercials to toys, and everything in between.

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:08.850
When a french chain named Quick was promoting
the release of Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:12.990
Menace 3D, they didn’t bother with toys,
and just got creative with the food itself.

00:03:12.990 --> 00:03:16.610
When Star Wars-themed burgers hit the menu,
diners were shocked to see that one of them

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:18.620
came on a black burger bun.

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:23.000
The “Dark Vador” burger was a double-pattied
behemoth, leaving customers split on almost

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:24.000
every aspect.

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:28.720
But the loudest critics questioned the logic
of a burger dedicated to a character who technically

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:32.660
isn’t even seen in the movie being promoted.

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:34.690
The Matrix Reloaded Cell Phone

00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:38.910
The Matrix showed audiences a darker side
of technology, but an impressively advanced

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:39.910
one, all the same.

00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:43.890
It comes as no surprise that the theme continued
with the marketing plans for The Matrix Reloaded.

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:49.140
The movie characters preferred to use Samsung’s
SPH-n270, and replicas were released in a

00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:51.480
limited number to the public in 2003.

00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:55.660
But it didn’t stop with the snap-sliding
phone: they came pre-loaded with Matrix propaganda,

00:03:55.660 --> 00:04:00.030
making it a Matrix-lover’s dream from the
ringtones to the menu design.

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:03.330
Considering how fast the phones themselves
became dated and obsolete, you’d think they’d

00:04:03.330 --> 00:04:04.380
be affordable by now.

00:04:04.380 --> 00:04:12.040
But they’re not for the budget-conscious
shopper, and can run up to $2,500 on eBay.

00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:16.690
A high price to pay considering it only displays
8 lines of text.

00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:20.299
Rocky Action Figures: The Meat, Wheelchair
Rocky

00:04:20.299 --> 00:04:24.050
Sealed action figures can be a high-value
collectors item, especially if they’re part

00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:25.430
of a limited release.

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:29.669
Toy company Jakks Pacific has released many
Rocky knickknacks, but two of them stand out

00:04:29.669 --> 00:04:31.080
for all the wrong reasons.

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:35.100
The Meat figurine is an homage to the infamous
meat locker scene from the original film,

00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:38.300
with Rocky II getting a post-fight figure
of Rocky in a wheelchair.

00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:41.259
It even comes complete with bruises for extra
authenticity!

00:04:41.259 --> 00:04:46.990
There’s a lot to love about Rocky Balboa,
but his merchandise isn’t one of them.

00:04:46.990 --> 00:04:49.569
300 Leather Briefs

00:04:49.569 --> 00:04:54.580
Zack Snyder’s graphic novel action film
300 chronicles the topless battle at Thermopylae

00:04:54.580 --> 00:04:59.020
between the Spartans and Persians, and singlehandedly
motivated thousands of people to start hitting

00:04:59.020 --> 00:05:00.389
the gym like never before.

00:05:00.389 --> 00:05:04.160
And, naturally, licensed replicas of Spartan
leather briefs hit the market to capitalize

00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:05.160
on the trend.

00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:09.990
Ranging from $79 to $95, it seems a small
price to pay to make a movie fan feel like

00:05:09.990 --> 00:05:13.599
one of the chiseled soldiers – even if they
don’t look like one.

00:05:13.599 --> 00:05:18.120
Spartan briefs can be bought, but the matching
washboard abs can only be earned.

00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:20.100
C3PO Tape Dispenser

00:05:20.100 --> 00:05:24.789
As we’ve mentioned earlier, Star Wars has
some of the weirdest themed merchandise on

00:05:24.789 --> 00:05:25.789
the market.

00:05:25.789 --> 00:05:29.759
Modifying everyday items like toasters, beds,
and guitars in the brand’s image has proven

00:05:29.759 --> 00:05:34.199
a no-brainer, but finally, the old “boring
tape dispenser” problem has been solved

00:05:34.199 --> 00:05:38.419
by Sigma, the group responsible for the ceramic
C3PO tape dispenser.

00:05:38.419 --> 00:05:43.090
If its mere existence isn't crazy enough,
consider that one in mint condition sold for

00:05:43.090 --> 00:05:47.080
$200 on eBay in 2014.

00:05:47.080 --> 00:05:50.900
Some fans have commented on the dispenser’s
awkward facial features, while others ask

00:05:50.900 --> 00:05:55.309
the more important question: why is the roll
of tape coming from between C3PO’s legs?

00:05:55.309 --> 00:05:56.360
another person.

00:05:56.360 --> 00:05:57.919
Letters to E.T

00:05:57.919 --> 00:06:02.849
Ever since its release in 1982, E.T. has been
widely beloved by audiences.

00:06:02.849 --> 00:06:05.229
Too bad the same can’t be said about it’s
merchandise.

00:06:05.229 --> 00:06:10.059
The 1983 book “Letters to E.T.” is exactly
what it sounds like: a series of letters written

00:06:10.059 --> 00:06:11.849
to the friendly extraterrestrial.

00:06:11.849 --> 00:06:15.659
Penned by people from all walks of life, the
letters praise both the alien and director

00:06:15.659 --> 00:06:20.280
Steven Spielberg, with a few explaining how
badly the senders hope to meet E.T. someday.

00:06:20.280 --> 00:06:24.400
The book was probably intended to capture
the nostalgia among fans, but was critically

00:06:24.400 --> 00:06:29.240
panned as nothing more than a published case
of ego-stroking on Spielberg’s part.

00:06:29.240 --> 00:06:30.979
Hey Screen Ranters!

00:06:30.979 --> 00:06:32.169
