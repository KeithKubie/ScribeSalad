1
00:00:00.960 --> 00:00:03.960
The Joe Rogan experience that's on the other side of the planet.

2
00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:07.980
Wasn't there book though.
We're like that happens and everyone goes to Australia,

3
00:00:07.981 --> 00:00:11.130
but there's like a cloud of radiation coming that's eventually gonna get them.

4
00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:16.440
Oh fuck.
Maybe we just get a big fan blow that shit to Russia.

5
00:00:16.530 --> 00:00:18.930
I bet that would work.
But it should.
The China plan,

6
00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:24.120
look if they can figure out how to nuke and entire country with a a few bombs

7
00:00:24.121 --> 00:00:28.350
that drop out of airplanes or shoot out a rockets.
Build a giant fan.

8
00:00:28.351 --> 00:00:30.300
Build a big fan.
Yeah.
Why is it so hard?

9
00:00:30.770 --> 00:00:32.370
Like I was reading the shit about space junk.

10
00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:33.810
Do you know how much space junk through is?

11
00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:36.930
Like this stuff's a lot floating around in space,

12
00:00:36.931 --> 00:00:40.890
like thousands of pieces of shit is flying around.
Broken satellites.

13
00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:45.030
Is it all just broken satellites?
All kinds of shit.
Yeah.
All kinds of stuff.

14
00:00:45.031 --> 00:00:49.110
Stuff from,
you know like when rockets take off and then they eject.

15
00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:52.370
Leave little pieces of stuff up in there.
And,

16
00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:56.640
and is it like in a ring like Saturn type of ring or is it just everywhere?

17
00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:01.740
It's everywhere.
It's all over the planet.
It's like co,
it's in the sky,

18
00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:02.880
like it's in the ocean.

19
00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:07.770
It's like there's pieces of shit just flying around above our head and like they

20
00:01:07.771 --> 00:01:11.100
have to be cognizant about it if they're going to launch a rocket.
Yeah,

21
00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:15.030
like you could run into it.
Space debris and human spacecraft,

22
00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:20.430
the all travel at speeds up to 17,500 miles an hour,

23
00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:24.840
more than 500,000 pieces of debris or space junk.

24
00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:27.510
Our track as the orbit earth.
Think of that.

25
00:01:27.511 --> 00:01:32.511
They travel at speeds up to 17,500 miles an hour,

26
00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.750
small enough for a relatively small piece of orbital debris to damage a

27
00:01:36.751 --> 00:01:40.680
satellite or a spacecraft.
That's,

28
00:01:40.681 --> 00:01:45.270
how was that movie with Sandra Bullock?
Gravity.
Yeah.
Yeah,

29
00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:47.550
so it doesn't,
I just jumped.
The gun comes in and says,
yeah,

30
00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:50.580
they're like fixing a satellite and something comes by and hits them.

31
00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:52.100
Sit in the next thing,
you know?
Yeah.

32
00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:55.260
Fuck that shit can happen and they don't know what to do either.

33
00:01:55.620 --> 00:01:57.210
Like the throw a net up there,
what are you going to do?

34
00:01:57.290 --> 00:02:00.570
I would think like some kind of like magnet satellite that would just attract

35
00:02:00.571 --> 00:02:04.410
everything.
Right?
But then it would probably get too heavy.

36
00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:08.130
I think we'll probably take out things that you need.
So yeah.

37
00:02:08.131 --> 00:02:10.380
Is this the junk that we can track over time?

38
00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:14.610
It starts at 57 there's only two things out there and then,
Oh God,

39
00:02:14.611 --> 00:02:16.890
we're gross were so gross.

40
00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:21.580
I bet the ocean's a similar similar story.
Wow.
Look at all this shit around.

41
00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:26.460
Even worse.
Oh my God,
that's incredible.
That's all real.
I don't know,

42
00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:32.210
2015 the entire low inner like near Earth orbit is covered with shit,

43
00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:38.550
space,
debris,
satellites and nonsense.

44
00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:39.790
I mean at one point in time,

45
00:02:39.791 --> 00:02:43.200
and we've only been traveling in the space since the 1960s right,
so what?

46
00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:46.090
When is this going to end like that?
That's not that long ago.

47
00:02:46.091 --> 00:02:47.250
That's 50 plus years ago.

48
00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:50.280
Were are going to do when it's a hundred years from now,
500 years from now.

49
00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:52.260
I mean are we going to be able to see the sun?

50
00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:56.370
We're going to look up and just see space shit floating over heads instead of

51
00:02:56.371 --> 00:02:59.620
only 500,000 pieces of the earth is pretty fucking big still.

52
00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:03.890
We'd have to get a lot,
I guess like I had a snap affected it.

53
00:03:03.891 --> 00:03:05.530
So if you dug a hole through the earth,

54
00:03:05.531 --> 00:03:07.630
it would take you 42 minutes to fall through it.

55
00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:11.140
It's like how fucking big is that?
So it's a long,
long fall.

56
00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:16.030
It's a long for Austin.
I was thinking would you stop in the middle?
He cooked.

57
00:03:16.031 --> 00:03:17.990
I know,
but in theory if you didn't,
yeah,

58
00:03:18.070 --> 00:03:23.070
if it was just a tube and zero temperature or neutral temperature tube,

59
00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:27.970
I wonder how like how accurate Snapple facts really have to be called bullshit

60
00:03:27.971 --> 00:03:32.380
on the Snapple facts.
Like I don't drink that shit so I don't read those things.

61
00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:36.110
I didn't even know they had Snapple facts until you just said that.
I didn't.

62
00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:40.300
They used to have like little things on the caps.
Like you say it,

63
00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:42.880
it makes sense to me,
but I don't think I've ever read one of them.

64
00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:46.300
I used to always read them.
No.
Yeah.

65
00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:50.980
I can't remember any of you ever get angry how to snap effect?
No.

66
00:03:56.440 --> 00:03:58.130
