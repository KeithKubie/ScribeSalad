00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.500
 

00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:06.180
- [Sal] What I want to do in this video is think about the idea of a fraction.

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:13.280
And for the sake of this video as we just learn what a fraction is, you can really think of it as a part of a whole.

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:16.660
Later on we'll think of it in even more ways.

00:00:16.660 --> 00:00:19.820
What do I mean by a part of a whole?

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:23.660
So let's imagine that we have a pizza.

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:26.900
I will do it in a pizza colored. . . so I'll do it an orange

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:29.120
I guess that's roughly the color of a pizza.

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:32.500
Pizza I guess is yellow and kind of red for the tomato sauce so yellow for the cheese.

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:36.520
So let's say this was a perfect circle. I'm gonna try my best to draw a circle right over here.

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:40.640
And let's say that I divided into four equal parts

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:49.060
so just like that I've divided it into two equal parts and now I will divide it into four equal parts.

00:00:49.060 --> 00:00:55.440
So there's a total of four slices, four equal slices of this pizza.

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:58.040
Four equal slices of this pizza.

00:00:58.040 --> 00:01:03.200
And let's say on three of the slices I have cheese only cheese.

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:04.460
only

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:06.320
only cheese.

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:12.380
And lets say on this fourth slice, I have cheese and, I don't know, I have olives

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:15.380
I have olives right over here.

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:16.900
So we can ask ourselves,

00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:20.960
"What fraction of this pizza has olives on it?"

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:27.760
Well, we have four total slices. They all are equal slices. We have four equal sections here

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:34.780
and one of those equal sections has olives, so we could say one-fourth of this pizza

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:37.940
one-fourth of the pizza

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:39.120
the pizza,

00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:40.620
has,

00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:43.880
has olives.

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:46.880
One out of the four. Now someone said,

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:50.360
"Well what fraction of this pizza only has cheese?".

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:54.300
Well this fraction has cheese, but it also has olives so we won't count that.

00:01:54.300 --> 00:02:00.080
Then we have one, two, three, three fractions three of these equal pieces have only cheese

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:06.260
so we could say three out of a total of four pieces of. . .

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:16.440
so three fourths of the pizza has only cheese.

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:20.380
Let's do a couple more examples because this is probably one of the most important

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:23.440
and most useful ideas that you can have in your brains.

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:25.300
Let's do another, another few examples.

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:27.700
So this is what we sliced up, a pizza.

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:33.720
Let's imagine instead that we're looking at a, some animals of some. . .

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:36.720
I'd say fruit. Fruit is easier for me to draw

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:42.480
So let's say that I have, I have an orange

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:44.720
so that's an orange right over there,

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:52.800
and I have a Banana. So that's my best attempt at drawing a banana right over here.

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:56.160
And I have a lemon.

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:59.880
I have a lemon.

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:05.920
Just like that. And let's say that I have an apple.

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:08.360
I'll draw. . .

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:10.600
Actually I'll draw an Apple.

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:13.760
It's a little bit of a strange color for an apple, but we'll go with it.

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:22.560
So that is my apple right over there, and actually let me draw one more, let me draw a grape.

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:23.720
Or grapes.

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:27.360
So I have a bunch of grapes right over here.

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:30.400
And if I were to ask you, at least the way that it is drawn,

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:35.960
"What fraction of my fruit that I have is. . ."

00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:37.880
Let's say,

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:40.440
". . .is yellow?"

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:44.200
"What fraction of my fruit as drawn is yellow?"

00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:50.720
Well, we could say, we have a total of one, two, three, four, five pieces of fruit

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:53.560
So there's a total of five pieces of fruit.

00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:57.760
And then what fraction of those pieces of fruit are yellow?

00:03:57.760 --> 00:04:01.280
Well, the way I drew it, I have two yellow pieces right over here.

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:08.680
So we'd say, "Two fifths of the fruit is. . ."

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:11.720
and it's strange that I'm writing this in white so I'll write it in yellow

00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:14.800
". . .is yellow."

00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:16.920
Two fifths is yellow.

00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:21.520
Let me do one more example to just really make the point clear.

00:04:21.520 --> 00:04:28.640
So let me draw a candy bar, and this is all food-related. I guess it's getting close to dinnertime. I apologize.

00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:31.400
So let's say I have a candy bar. Just like that.

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:33.160
And let me divide it into

00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:35.720
let me divide it into 5 equal pieces 1

00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:39.800
one, two, three, four

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:41.200
that doesn't look too equal.

00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:42.480
So the whole point is to do it equal,

00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:45.080
one, two, three, four

00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:46.720
that looks pretty close.

00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:49.360
So let's assume that these are equal pieces.

00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:52.880
So my drawing isn't perfect but let's assume all of these pieces are equal

00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:56.040
and I'm hungry so let's say that I eat

00:04:56.040 --> 00:05:01.880
I eat this piece, and I eat this piece so they essentially go away.

00:05:01.880 --> 00:05:05.120
So what fraction of the pieces have I eaten?

00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:12.200
Well, I have a total of five pieces. There's a total of five equal sections of this candy bar I guess I could say.

00:05:12.200 --> 00:05:15.480
And I ate two of them, so two fifths

00:05:15.480 --> 00:05:20.520
two-fifths of this bar, so this is, I've taken them away

00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:26.800
two-fifths of the bar have been eaten.

00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:29.000
Have been eaten.

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:33.680
So I'll leave you there, maybe I'll make another video that doesn't have as many food analogies,

00:05:33.680 --> 00:05:37.840
but this is a super useful concept and I encourage you to think about this as much as possible

00:05:37.840 --> 00:05:40.400
and then try the exercises on Khan Academy
