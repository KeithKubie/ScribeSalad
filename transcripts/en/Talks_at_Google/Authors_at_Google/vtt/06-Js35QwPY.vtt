[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:05.394 --> 00:00:06.810
NICOLE FARKOUH:
I'm thrilled to be

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:10.910
able to introduce and converse
with Jennifer Brown of Jennifer

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:12.690
Brown Consulting.

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:18.300
And she not only is the founder
of a well-reputed diversity

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:23.070
and inclusion firm, a published
author, and a just generally

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:27.067
fun and exciting person, but she
is also a native Californian.

00:00:27.067 --> 00:00:27.900
JENNIFER BROWN: Yes.

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:30.441
NICOLE FARKOUH: And she hails
from behind the orange curtain,

00:00:30.441 --> 00:00:32.500
which I'll let her
explain what that is.

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:33.730
And she's also a--

00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:36.080
I'm not sure if it's OK to
say recovering opera singer.

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:36.740
JENNIFER BROWN: Opera singer.

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:38.450
NICOLE FARKOUH: Yeah, a
recovering opera star.

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:38.810
JENNIFER BROWN: Absolutely.

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:39.768
NICOLE FARKOUH: Singer.

00:00:39.768 --> 00:00:42.690
And we're going to have a
lot of fun talking today.

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:45.420
So the format is that I'm
going to just ask her a number

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:49.200
of questions, and then we'll--
there's a Dory associated with

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:49.720
the talk.

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:52.160
And anyone who is
virtual, we invite

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:55.870
you to post any questions you
may have up there as well.

00:00:55.870 --> 00:01:00.120
And then we'll open up to
the floor for questions also.

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:04.769
So Jennifer, I'd love to ask
you to start off by just sharing

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:06.120
a little bit about your story.

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:07.740
JENNIFER BROWN: OK.

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:10.260
So typically where I
start about my story

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:15.060
is that I grew up in a musical
family in Southern California.

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:16.770
And I was the oldest
of three kids.

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:20.730
And when I was 27,
I decided I was

00:01:20.730 --> 00:01:23.760
going to pursue my love
of music full time,

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:26.130
so I moved to New
York City to make it,

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:29.645
as one does, and did
opera conservatory,

00:01:29.645 --> 00:01:32.740
so I got my master's
in operatic voice.

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:35.241
And that was really
what I wanted to do.

00:01:35.241 --> 00:01:36.990
And one thing led to
another in the course

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:39.240
of the intense training
that one goes through

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:40.750
in the opera world.

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:42.690
And unfortunately,
I injured my voice,

00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:45.330
and I had to get
several surgeries.

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:47.160
And the recovery
from vocal surgery

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:49.320
is that you have
to be completely

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:53.580
silent for several weeks
as your mechanism heals.

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:56.610
And when you're finally
able to make a sound,

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:59.190
all that comes out
is a little squeak.

00:01:59.190 --> 00:02:02.130
And so I worked with
speech therapists

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:04.490
and kind of coaxed
my voice back,

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:06.990
but the writing was
on the wall, and I

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:11.520
knew that I would never
be able to really use

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:15.690
my instrument in a full-time
role as a performer.

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:19.680
So it was really heartbreaking
to lose my voice, literally,

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:21.822
and my creative
means of expressing

00:02:21.822 --> 00:02:24.030
myself and connecting with
audiences, which is really

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:26.340
what I loved to do.

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:28.636
But luckily, friends
that had been

00:02:28.636 --> 00:02:30.010
in the stage and
performing world

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:31.410
said, why don't you
look into the field

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:32.250
of corporate training?

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:34.166
You know, if you like
being in front of people

00:02:34.166 --> 00:02:36.030
and on the stage,
you get to work

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:38.190
with people every single
day, and that's your job.

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:39.773
And I thought, wow,
that sounds really

00:02:39.773 --> 00:02:42.420
fun and right up my alley, so
I got another master's degree

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:44.550
in something called
organizational development,

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:46.020
organizational change.

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:49.080
Some of you may know it is I/O
psych, I/O psychology, which

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:52.110
is industrial-organizational
relations, anything having

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:55.710
to do with how organizations
function optimally and humans

00:02:55.710 --> 00:02:57.520
in those organizations.

00:02:57.520 --> 00:03:01.080
And so that kind
of saved my life

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:04.680
and gave me more inspiration
to continue and build

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:08.870
into the whole field of
leadership development.

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:12.990
So PS, I was meant to use my
voice, just not as a singer.

00:03:12.990 --> 00:03:15.120
And I would come
to understand how

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:19.320
profound the metaphor of
the voice really was for me,

00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:22.270
because I was also in
the LGBT community.

00:03:22.270 --> 00:03:24.570
So I've had a female
partner for 20 years.

00:03:24.570 --> 00:03:28.530
I've been out since I was
22, and I'm now in my 40s.

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:31.350
But I absolutely
wasn't using my voice

00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:34.260
in the workplace in a
series of corporate roles.

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:37.260
Even as I started my
company 10 years ago,

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:38.670
I really worried that--

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:41.820
I wasn't sure how
it would go for me,

00:03:41.820 --> 00:03:44.310
trying to sell
contracts to people

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:45.600
that were different than me.

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:47.070
Would they believe what I say?

00:03:47.070 --> 00:03:48.570
Would they accept me?

00:03:48.570 --> 00:03:51.100
Would they trust
me and my opinion?

00:03:51.100 --> 00:03:52.730
I mean, I think--

00:03:52.730 --> 00:03:54.660
and still to this
day, there are moments

00:03:54.660 --> 00:04:00.480
when you wonder strategically
how much of my full self

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:03.030
can I bring into this situation?

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:05.012
Does it serve me to share that?

00:04:05.012 --> 00:04:05.970
Is it a learning point?

00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:07.511
Is it a teaching
point, or is it just

00:04:07.511 --> 00:04:09.000
going to distract
the conversation?

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:10.920
Does it really matter?

00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:12.785
And it really does matter.

00:04:12.785 --> 00:04:13.410
It does matter.

00:04:13.410 --> 00:04:15.210
And if it doesn't matter
to me, it certainly

00:04:15.210 --> 00:04:16.649
matters to people
that are looking

00:04:16.649 --> 00:04:21.060
for more role models that look
like me and that have my story.

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:24.230
And so that's what I kind
of always come back to is

00:04:24.230 --> 00:04:26.970
it's important for all of us to
stand up and tell our diversity

00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:28.440
stories.

00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:31.980
And for me, giving voice to the
voiceless in the workplace--

00:04:31.980 --> 00:04:34.370
and that, to me, means
all diverse talent,

00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:36.900
i.e., women, people
of color, LGBT

00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:39.330
people, anybody
who doesn't really

00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:42.030
conform to what a leader looks
like in so many companies

00:04:42.030 --> 00:04:43.920
that I consult to.

00:04:43.920 --> 00:04:46.990
I believe in them,
and I was one of them.

00:04:46.990 --> 00:04:48.570
And so it's really us.

00:04:48.570 --> 00:04:49.740
It's not them.

00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:52.560
And so we dedicate
our work at my company

00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:55.950
to really raising those
voices up and also teaching

00:04:55.950 --> 00:04:59.740
the company why diverse talent
is so valuable in so many ways

00:04:59.740 --> 00:05:03.310
and bringing that
awareness to people.

00:05:03.310 --> 00:05:06.259
So it's really-- isn't it funny?

00:05:06.259 --> 00:05:08.300
It makes sense in hindsight
when you kind of look

00:05:08.300 --> 00:05:10.049
at all the pieces of
your life and why did

00:05:10.049 --> 00:05:11.840
things happen the way they did.

00:05:11.840 --> 00:05:15.390
But I absolutely feel like
we're in the sweet spot now.

00:05:15.390 --> 00:05:18.060
And God knows this conversation
is hotter than ever,

00:05:18.060 --> 00:05:19.511
which we'll talk about today.

00:05:19.511 --> 00:05:21.260
So we're right in the
right spot, I think,

00:05:21.260 --> 00:05:22.790
to be carrying this message.

00:05:22.790 --> 00:05:24.140
NICOLE FARKOUH: Yeah.

00:05:24.140 --> 00:05:26.390
So I was going to jump in
and hit the nail on the head

00:05:26.390 --> 00:05:30.740
and ask you, as you're talking
about finding your own voice

00:05:30.740 --> 00:05:35.570
and the struggle,
your diversity story,

00:05:35.570 --> 00:05:38.330
you also carry with you the
privilege of being able to hide

00:05:38.330 --> 00:05:39.300
your diversity story.

00:05:39.300 --> 00:05:40.216
JENNIFER BROWN: Right.

00:05:40.216 --> 00:05:44.790
NICOLE FARKOUH: And so I'm
curious how you build--

00:05:44.790 --> 00:05:49.465
how you navigate the space
in which there are people who

00:05:49.465 --> 00:05:51.840
you're trying to work on behalf
of people who cannot hide

00:05:51.840 --> 00:05:55.140
their diversity story, and how
do you build credibility with

00:05:55.140 --> 00:05:56.170
those people?

00:05:56.170 --> 00:05:58.612
And how does that come up
in the work that you do?

00:05:58.612 --> 00:06:00.570
JENNIFER BROWN: Yeah, I
mean, it's interesting.

00:06:00.570 --> 00:06:04.411
It reminds me of when I
first got into this work, I--

00:06:04.411 --> 00:06:05.910
whether people said
it to me or not,

00:06:05.910 --> 00:06:08.100
I think they wondered
what is a woman that looks

00:06:08.100 --> 00:06:11.040
like that doing in this work.

00:06:11.040 --> 00:06:14.035
I don't know if that was really
said to me all that much, but--

00:06:14.035 --> 00:06:16.320
and it is actually
really preposterous

00:06:16.320 --> 00:06:19.680
that I'm in this work in a
crazy way, because I grew up--

00:06:19.680 --> 00:06:22.120
I also have a lot
of class privilege.

00:06:22.120 --> 00:06:25.780
And I always went to
very expensive schools.

00:06:25.780 --> 00:06:28.290
And honestly, I
don't think anyone

00:06:28.290 --> 00:06:32.250
in my family forecast
me doing this work.

00:06:32.250 --> 00:06:35.310
It just wasn't something
they even knew about.

00:06:35.310 --> 00:06:37.320
And that's true for so
many of us, I think,

00:06:37.320 --> 00:06:39.000
that feel called to do this.

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:41.640
And coming out was a
really big part of that.

00:06:41.640 --> 00:06:45.330
I have to say women's studies in
college and sort of discovering

00:06:45.330 --> 00:06:49.620
my feminism was probably even
a bigger aha moment for me,

00:06:49.620 --> 00:06:51.990
growing up in a really
traditional family with really

00:06:51.990 --> 00:06:55.260
traditional gender roles
and expectations of me.

00:06:55.260 --> 00:07:00.300
So the whole process of kind
of casting that aside and kind

00:07:00.300 --> 00:07:01.800
of striking out on
a different path

00:07:01.800 --> 00:07:04.590
to say, you know, I've got
to live true to myself,

00:07:04.590 --> 00:07:08.840
but I always felt compelled to,
if I needed to be a role model,

00:07:08.840 --> 00:07:11.000
I was ready to do that.

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:14.160
And if people needed me
to be a champion for them,

00:07:14.160 --> 00:07:15.280
I was ready to do that.

00:07:15.280 --> 00:07:16.696
And I think I
honestly learned how

00:07:16.696 --> 00:07:19.110
to do that being in the
LGBT community, where

00:07:19.110 --> 00:07:20.250
we needed champions.

00:07:20.250 --> 00:07:22.830
I mean, we need our
straight ally friends

00:07:22.830 --> 00:07:26.580
so desperately to even
just be safe, let alone

00:07:26.580 --> 00:07:29.890
have conversations that we
can't have on our own behalf.

00:07:29.890 --> 00:07:33.620
So the way I've come
to think about it is--

00:07:33.620 --> 00:07:34.620
and I don't know how--

00:07:34.620 --> 00:07:39.150
I mean, I just show up, and
I admit what I don't know,

00:07:39.150 --> 00:07:41.970
but I also talk a lot about
how I have a responsibility

00:07:41.970 --> 00:07:44.760
to be an ally to
others because I

00:07:44.760 --> 00:07:47.940
have relative privilege because
of certain unearned things

00:07:47.940 --> 00:07:49.389
about me.

00:07:49.389 --> 00:07:51.180
Whether that means I
can walk, for example,

00:07:51.180 --> 00:07:54.342
into an executive room and
have people listen to me

00:07:54.342 --> 00:07:56.550
in a different way because
they're making stereotypes

00:07:56.550 --> 00:08:01.020
about who I am, often
incorrect, right?

00:08:01.020 --> 00:08:02.970
Only for me to then
reveal, which I think

00:08:02.970 --> 00:08:06.450
is a powerful aha moment
for many people as well.

00:08:06.450 --> 00:08:10.620
But I see myself as
needing allyship, but also

00:08:10.620 --> 00:08:13.830
providing that and
identifying as an ally.

00:08:13.830 --> 00:08:15.930
And the LGBT community
really gave me

00:08:15.930 --> 00:08:18.720
that language, because
I experienced directly

00:08:18.720 --> 00:08:21.360
what that really meant for
a marginalized community.

00:08:21.360 --> 00:08:23.940
So I really see it
as my job to make

00:08:23.940 --> 00:08:27.790
sure I'm employing my
privilege on others' behalf.

00:08:27.790 --> 00:08:29.070
And I think--

00:08:29.070 --> 00:08:32.130
I don't know if workplaces are
really going to figure this

00:08:32.130 --> 00:08:35.130
diversity and inclusion thing
out until we have more people

00:08:35.130 --> 00:08:39.030
who are thinking about their
intersectionality more deeply

00:08:39.030 --> 00:08:42.360
and thinking about what do
I have that others need,

00:08:42.360 --> 00:08:44.760
where I can take the hit
maybe, or I can have the tough

00:08:44.760 --> 00:08:48.300
conversation, or I can be the
one that challenges where they

00:08:48.300 --> 00:08:49.410
can't.

00:08:49.410 --> 00:08:52.380
And I think if we had more
of that going on, we wouldn't

00:08:52.380 --> 00:08:54.810
be so penalized, those
of us who are always

00:08:54.810 --> 00:08:57.360
the squeaky wheel, who
are always bringing up

00:08:57.360 --> 00:08:58.860
what's said that
wasn't appropriate,

00:08:58.860 --> 00:09:01.980
or challenging somebody's choice
about who they pick for a team

00:09:01.980 --> 00:09:03.780
or who got the job or whatever.

00:09:03.780 --> 00:09:07.320
It can't always be the
woman, the person of color,

00:09:07.320 --> 00:09:09.120
the gay person,
because there's lots

00:09:09.120 --> 00:09:14.100
of studies that show that it
puts you in a difficult spot.

00:09:14.100 --> 00:09:17.010
From a perception standpoint,
it can actually hurt you.

00:09:17.010 --> 00:09:18.660
So we're not alone.

00:09:18.660 --> 00:09:20.430
We're not alone in
fighting these battles,

00:09:20.430 --> 00:09:22.680
but we've got to figure
out how to really utilize

00:09:22.680 --> 00:09:23.580
people around us.

00:09:23.580 --> 00:09:26.699
And I'd like them
to step up and say,

00:09:26.699 --> 00:09:28.740
I don't need to wait to
be asked to do something.

00:09:28.740 --> 00:09:29.610
I'm going to do something.

00:09:29.610 --> 00:09:32.160
I'm going to use my privilege,
and I'm going to be an ally.

00:09:32.160 --> 00:09:33.960
NICOLE FARKOUH: Yeah.

00:09:33.960 --> 00:09:35.460
I'm curious-- you
mentioned that you

00:09:35.460 --> 00:09:37.260
come from a background
of class privilege.

00:09:37.260 --> 00:09:42.100
How do you think that
privilege facilitates the work

00:09:42.100 --> 00:09:42.600
that you do?

00:09:42.600 --> 00:09:44.641
JENNIFER BROWN: Oh my
gosh, I love that question,

00:09:44.641 --> 00:09:47.880
because it's something I wanted
to hide for a really long time.

00:09:47.880 --> 00:09:51.240
We talk about-- there's a
really wonderful research

00:09:51.240 --> 00:09:53.044
on covering out of Deloitte.

00:09:53.044 --> 00:09:54.210
I recommend you all read it.

00:09:54.210 --> 00:09:56.250
It's called "Uncovering Talent."

00:09:56.250 --> 00:10:00.690
And it is the hiding
or minimizing,

00:10:00.690 --> 00:10:03.447
if you can-- the minimizing
of a stigmatized identity.

00:10:03.447 --> 00:10:04.530
So some of us can hide it.

00:10:04.530 --> 00:10:07.170
Some of us can't.

00:10:07.170 --> 00:10:09.540
My class background
is something honestly

00:10:09.540 --> 00:10:11.910
that throws people off.

00:10:11.910 --> 00:10:13.870
And I don't really talk
about it that much.

00:10:13.870 --> 00:10:20.190
However, my education forced
me to write voluminous amounts

00:10:20.190 --> 00:10:21.420
on all sorts of subjects.

00:10:21.420 --> 00:10:23.970
It forced me to be
on stage in front

00:10:23.970 --> 00:10:27.190
of hundreds over and
over and over again,

00:10:27.190 --> 00:10:28.516
which means I'm fearless.

00:10:28.516 --> 00:10:30.390
I mean, I'm really,
like, you can't stump me.

00:10:30.390 --> 00:10:32.370
You can't frighten me.

00:10:32.370 --> 00:10:34.230
I am so resilient.

00:10:34.230 --> 00:10:37.935
And part of our output at JBC
is tons of thought leadership.

00:10:37.935 --> 00:10:39.060
Like, we're always writing.

00:10:39.060 --> 00:10:40.610
We're researching.

00:10:40.610 --> 00:10:44.980
I'm using a lot of my ability
to connect ideas in a way,

00:10:44.980 --> 00:10:47.980
I think, speaking the
language that my readers can

00:10:47.980 --> 00:10:51.340
absorb and understand.

00:10:51.340 --> 00:10:54.940
And honestly, it's
that level of polish

00:10:54.940 --> 00:10:58.270
that you need as a performer,
is something that I think really

00:10:58.270 --> 00:11:01.270
helps you deal with the
executive level at companies,

00:11:01.270 --> 00:11:05.450
because it's a
tough place to be.

00:11:05.450 --> 00:11:06.179
It's challenging.

00:11:06.179 --> 00:11:07.720
And you have to
really hang in there,

00:11:07.720 --> 00:11:10.170
and you've got to
build trust quickly.

00:11:10.170 --> 00:11:11.170
You've got to influence.

00:11:11.170 --> 00:11:13.540
You've got to
establish credibility.

00:11:13.540 --> 00:11:15.970
You're already a woman walking
into those spaces, which

00:11:15.970 --> 00:11:19.510
are largely male,
so I'm already aware

00:11:19.510 --> 00:11:21.280
that I've got to sort
of overcompensate

00:11:21.280 --> 00:11:27.130
and be like extra perfect
and extra creative, I think,

00:11:27.130 --> 00:11:29.290
in terms of, like, are
they listening to me?

00:11:29.290 --> 00:11:30.130
Is that landing?

00:11:30.130 --> 00:11:31.450
Do I need to take another tack?

00:11:31.450 --> 00:11:33.190
Like, do I need a
personal story here,

00:11:33.190 --> 00:11:36.280
or do I need some data here?

00:11:36.280 --> 00:11:40.720
I like the challenge of it,
but I think my background kind

00:11:40.720 --> 00:11:41.462
of prepared me.

00:11:41.462 --> 00:11:43.420
And the other thing that
prepared me, honestly,

00:11:43.420 --> 00:11:49.370
is having a really domineering
father who's still alive.

00:11:49.370 --> 00:11:51.930
He's not going to
ever watch this.

00:11:51.930 --> 00:11:55.120
This doesn't leave the
four walls of Google.

00:11:55.120 --> 00:12:00.130
But being the oldest daughter
of a very, very dominant

00:12:00.130 --> 00:12:03.640
male figure, just from
a survival perspective,

00:12:03.640 --> 00:12:09.700
I had to really figure out how
I was going to endure that,

00:12:09.700 --> 00:12:11.950
but what I was meant
to learn from it.

00:12:11.950 --> 00:12:13.870
And it turns out
what I was probably

00:12:13.870 --> 00:12:16.000
meant to learn from
it is how to deal

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:21.400
with the people I deal with now,
which are a lot like my dad.

00:12:21.400 --> 00:12:24.460
I have to go into those rooms
and have those conversations.

00:12:24.460 --> 00:12:27.500
And yelling about it,
getting upset about,

00:12:27.500 --> 00:12:28.840
it's not going to work.

00:12:28.840 --> 00:12:29.980
It has to be strategic.

00:12:29.980 --> 00:12:31.650
It has to be very careful.

00:12:31.650 --> 00:12:32.650
It has to be thoughtful.

00:12:32.650 --> 00:12:35.860
It has to be respectful, because
I think we lose a lot of people

00:12:35.860 --> 00:12:38.459
if we kind of attack.

00:12:38.459 --> 00:12:40.000
So I think that
honestly prepared me.

00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:42.340
NICOLE FARKOUH: So in the
middle of all that you

00:12:42.340 --> 00:12:44.110
have to show up as powerful.

00:12:44.110 --> 00:12:46.600
You are a successful
businesswoman.

00:12:46.600 --> 00:12:51.550
How do you-- do you struggle
with imposter syndrome?

00:12:51.550 --> 00:12:54.190
JENNIFER BROWN: Yes.

00:12:54.190 --> 00:12:55.570
I work on it a lot.

00:12:55.570 --> 00:12:57.820
Does everyone know what
imposter syndrome is?

00:12:57.820 --> 00:13:00.460
Sort of not really earning
the place that you're at

00:13:00.460 --> 00:13:02.320
and the opportunities
that you have.

00:13:02.320 --> 00:13:05.710
And I think some of us do it
to ourselves more than others.

00:13:05.710 --> 00:13:10.540
Women are notorious for
playing small, I think.

00:13:10.540 --> 00:13:14.830
So it's honestly something you
have to build the muscle with.

00:13:14.830 --> 00:13:18.850
And it involves a little
bit of believing--

00:13:18.850 --> 00:13:19.890
drinking the Kool-Aid.

00:13:19.890 --> 00:13:22.030
It is believing the
things that people

00:13:22.030 --> 00:13:23.830
say to you about what
a difference you're

00:13:23.830 --> 00:13:25.444
making every day.

00:13:25.444 --> 00:13:26.860
It is actually
allowing that stuff

00:13:26.860 --> 00:13:29.990
to land instead of
pushing it off and saying,

00:13:29.990 --> 00:13:31.240
oh, they're just saying that.

00:13:31.240 --> 00:13:34.420
That's what we're so good at
doing-- oh, it's nothing--

00:13:34.420 --> 00:13:35.710
minimizing it.

00:13:35.710 --> 00:13:40.180
I think, for us, when
you are being successful,

00:13:40.180 --> 00:13:41.800
you have to let that stuff in.

00:13:41.800 --> 00:13:44.800
And then you've got to start
to believe it to a degree

00:13:44.800 --> 00:13:50.160
and being obviously practical
and realistic about it.

00:13:50.160 --> 00:13:52.451
And really, I mean,
it's just like branding.

00:13:52.451 --> 00:13:54.700
I think brands are always
listening to their audience.

00:13:54.700 --> 00:13:56.799
I'm always listening to mine.

00:13:56.799 --> 00:13:58.090
What is resonating with people?

00:13:58.090 --> 00:14:00.730
What do they really appreciate
about what we're doing?

00:14:00.730 --> 00:14:03.800
I'm constantly trying to think,
how can I be more valuable?

00:14:03.800 --> 00:14:04.900
What do they need?

00:14:04.900 --> 00:14:06.850
And how can we be of service?

00:14:06.850 --> 00:14:11.800
And so I think if
you're in service of,

00:14:11.800 --> 00:14:14.380
far from being
called sort of overly

00:14:14.380 --> 00:14:17.800
confident or
self-promoting, you're

00:14:17.800 --> 00:14:19.840
actually adding
value all the time.

00:14:19.840 --> 00:14:22.060
I mean, my MO as a business
owner has always been,

00:14:22.060 --> 00:14:25.120
like, what can I
write about that's not

00:14:25.120 --> 00:14:27.650
being written about right now?

00:14:27.650 --> 00:14:31.090
What can I lend my credibility
to and give some weight to,

00:14:31.090 --> 00:14:33.070
so that people start
to talk about something

00:14:33.070 --> 00:14:34.780
I want them to talk about?

00:14:34.780 --> 00:14:36.100
And I love having that.

00:14:36.100 --> 00:14:37.370
That's power.

00:14:37.370 --> 00:14:39.097
But it's power for good.

00:14:39.097 --> 00:14:40.930
So I think you just
have to look at yourself

00:14:40.930 --> 00:14:44.000
and say, I have all these
tools at my disposal.

00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:46.780
It's only harming
me and the world

00:14:46.780 --> 00:14:51.460
if I don't use them for
the purposes that I judge

00:14:51.460 --> 00:14:52.360
are important.

00:14:52.360 --> 00:14:56.230
And after a while in the same
field, you become an expert.

00:14:56.230 --> 00:14:57.370
Read Malcolm Gladwell.

00:14:57.370 --> 00:15:01.450
When he talks about the
mastery, he says 10,000 hours.

00:15:01.450 --> 00:15:03.790
How many thousands of
hours have I spent?

00:15:03.790 --> 00:15:05.420
I mean, 300 pages was nothing.

00:15:05.420 --> 00:15:08.470
I was like, oh, I have to stop.

00:15:08.470 --> 00:15:10.540
You learn so much,
and I think you've

00:15:10.540 --> 00:15:12.160
got to really just
embrace that you

00:15:12.160 --> 00:15:14.710
are an expert on this stuff.

00:15:14.710 --> 00:15:17.362
And expertise-- I don't
even know if 10,000 hours

00:15:17.362 --> 00:15:18.070
is really needed.

00:15:18.070 --> 00:15:19.367
Our world is going so fast.

00:15:19.367 --> 00:15:20.950
We were talking about
this last night.

00:15:20.950 --> 00:15:24.400
To call yourself an expert
is even changing now

00:15:24.400 --> 00:15:26.920
to the point where I think
the best experts in a way

00:15:26.920 --> 00:15:30.520
are people who are present,
people who are listening,

00:15:30.520 --> 00:15:33.130
who are agile, who
are responsive,

00:15:33.130 --> 00:15:35.720
who are willing to
challenge norms.

00:15:35.720 --> 00:15:38.590
So I don't know if it
means you have five PhDs.

00:15:38.590 --> 00:15:40.120
I mean, in what?

00:15:40.120 --> 00:15:42.730
I think our world is
changing so quickly.

00:15:42.730 --> 00:15:47.110
Those of us who are at the top
level of these conversations

00:15:47.110 --> 00:15:48.520
can synthesize.

00:15:48.520 --> 00:15:50.050
We can connect the dots.

00:15:50.050 --> 00:15:53.140
We can make people
feel heard and seen.

00:15:53.140 --> 00:15:55.630
To me, that's the kind of
experts we really want,

00:15:55.630 --> 00:15:58.150
not the ones that have
been in an ivory tower

00:15:58.150 --> 00:16:02.014
forever and necessarily
studying a discipline.

00:16:02.014 --> 00:16:03.430
NICOLE FARKOUH:
And what would you

00:16:03.430 --> 00:16:07.000
say are some of the successes
you are most proud of when you

00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:08.582
say they have to actually land?

00:16:08.582 --> 00:16:09.850
You have to let them land.

00:16:09.850 --> 00:16:10.891
JENNIFER BROWN: Oh, yeah.

00:16:10.891 --> 00:16:14.710
I'd say, well, giving
a TED Talk was insane.

00:16:14.710 --> 00:16:16.870
Speaking of imposter
syndrome, I almost

00:16:16.870 --> 00:16:20.110
didn't do my TED Talk
that fell into my lap.

00:16:20.110 --> 00:16:23.920
I think I made a lot of excuses
about why I wasn't ready,

00:16:23.920 --> 00:16:28.120
or whether I wasn't--

00:16:28.120 --> 00:16:29.970
I knew I needed to
come out in the talk.

00:16:29.970 --> 00:16:31.780
It was important and it was
important to the organizers,

00:16:31.780 --> 00:16:32.280
actually.

00:16:32.280 --> 00:16:33.400
And I was, like, hmm.

00:16:33.400 --> 00:16:35.890
So at the time, it
was 2010 or '09.

00:16:35.890 --> 00:16:38.680
And there weren't a lot
of out LGBT TED speakers.

00:16:38.680 --> 00:16:41.260
And there was nobody talking
about diversity and inclusion

00:16:41.260 --> 00:16:42.340
on the TED stage.

00:16:42.340 --> 00:16:45.820
And it was the Wild West of the
internet and comment sections.

00:16:45.820 --> 00:16:48.830
And I just didn't know
what would happen.

00:16:48.830 --> 00:16:52.414
But even bigger than coming
out, I almost didn't do it.

00:16:52.414 --> 00:16:53.830
And I look back,
and I think, this

00:16:53.830 --> 00:16:57.130
is what happens to
women in particular.

00:16:57.130 --> 00:16:59.260
We don't think we're ready.

00:16:59.260 --> 00:17:02.320
We're scared it's not
going to be perfect.

00:17:02.320 --> 00:17:05.980
We think we have to do
more homework before we're

00:17:05.980 --> 00:17:08.220
ready to be that bold.

00:17:08.220 --> 00:17:12.890
And honestly, I delayed in
calling the organizers back.

00:17:12.890 --> 00:17:14.599
I kind of hemmed and hawed.

00:17:14.599 --> 00:17:17.099
I procrastinated.

00:17:17.099 --> 00:17:21.050
And it's really odd behavior
for someone like me, who so

00:17:21.050 --> 00:17:22.970
many people want to hear from.

00:17:22.970 --> 00:17:27.619
And for me to almost say
I'm not ready for that,

00:17:27.619 --> 00:17:29.090
that makes no sense.

00:17:29.090 --> 00:17:31.500
That's kind of some wiring
thing that's going on

00:17:31.500 --> 00:17:33.530
and a lot of powerful
socialization.

00:17:33.530 --> 00:17:35.210
And when I ended
up doing it, I was

00:17:35.210 --> 00:17:38.326
one of the few women in
a lineup of lots of men.

00:17:38.326 --> 00:17:40.700
So there's probably two or
three women speakers and maybe

00:17:40.700 --> 00:17:41.200
10 men.

00:17:41.200 --> 00:17:44.360
It was at TEDxPresidio, which
is right in San Francisco.

00:17:44.360 --> 00:17:46.370
So big, like, 1,000 people.

00:17:46.370 --> 00:17:50.630
And I asked the organizers,
why are there are not

00:17:50.630 --> 00:17:52.370
more women in the agenda?

00:17:52.370 --> 00:17:56.390
And they literally said, none
of the women called us back.

00:17:56.390 --> 00:17:58.745
All the men got back
to us immediately.

00:17:58.745 --> 00:17:59.150
NICOLE FARKOUH: Note to self.

00:17:59.150 --> 00:18:00.358
JENNIFER BROWN: Note to self.

00:18:00.358 --> 00:18:01.910
They got back immediately to us.

00:18:01.910 --> 00:18:04.100
And they got all of their
stuff to us so quickly.

00:18:04.100 --> 00:18:06.702
And they were so self-assured
about the message

00:18:06.702 --> 00:18:07.910
that they were going to give.

00:18:07.910 --> 00:18:08.195
NICOLE FARKOUH: Wow.

00:18:08.195 --> 00:18:08.840
JENNIFER BROWN: I know, right?

00:18:08.840 --> 00:18:10.160
NICOLE FARKOUH: That
is a great anecdote.

00:18:10.160 --> 00:18:11.743
JENNIFER BROWN: It's
a crazy anecdote.

00:18:11.743 --> 00:18:13.820
And I thought to myself,
that was almost me,

00:18:13.820 --> 00:18:17.300
thinking my story wasn't
important enough to share.

00:18:17.300 --> 00:18:18.920
And the crux of
the story I shared

00:18:18.920 --> 00:18:21.290
was honestly the voice
story that I just shared.

00:18:21.290 --> 00:18:25.640
And I thought it was
like a nothing story.

00:18:25.640 --> 00:18:27.530
I just was, like,
who's going to care?

00:18:27.530 --> 00:18:30.080
It's just me, like, poor me.

00:18:30.080 --> 00:18:30.920
How dare I?

00:18:30.920 --> 00:18:31.820
I'm so privileged.

00:18:31.820 --> 00:18:33.710
Like, I get to study opera.

00:18:33.710 --> 00:18:36.410
So why am I up on this
stage talking about this?

00:18:36.410 --> 00:18:38.810
And I guess what I
found subsequently

00:18:38.810 --> 00:18:41.540
in telling that story so many
times is so many people can

00:18:41.540 --> 00:18:45.920
see themselves in your story
in ways that are not literal.

00:18:45.920 --> 00:18:47.030
It is a metaphor.

00:18:47.030 --> 00:18:48.800
And the fact that
you're being vulnerable

00:18:48.800 --> 00:18:52.310
on stage, sharing something that
you hid, that you were ashamed

00:18:52.310 --> 00:18:55.970
of, that broke your heart, that
you almost didn't recover from,

00:18:55.970 --> 00:18:58.662
is so human and so universal.

00:18:58.662 --> 00:19:00.620
And it was such an
important lesson for me too.

00:19:00.620 --> 00:19:02.750
And as I teach
diversity stories now,

00:19:02.750 --> 00:19:05.570
especially to people who
don't think they know anything

00:19:05.570 --> 00:19:09.380
about diversity, I
say, you absolutely

00:19:09.380 --> 00:19:10.740
do know something about this.

00:19:10.740 --> 00:19:11.690
We just have to--

00:19:11.690 --> 00:19:13.620
we just have to
find that for you.

00:19:13.620 --> 00:19:15.770
And then we need to
prepare you to tell it

00:19:15.770 --> 00:19:19.250
in a way that's authentic and
connects audiences to you.

00:19:19.250 --> 00:19:23.180
And my friend says it's
not the pain Olympics.

00:19:23.180 --> 00:19:25.790
Let's not stack up
all of our grievances,

00:19:25.790 --> 00:19:27.050
and say who has suffered?

00:19:27.050 --> 00:19:29.090
Yes, some of us have
suffered more than others.

00:19:29.090 --> 00:19:30.620
Absolutely.

00:19:30.620 --> 00:19:32.720
But that doesn't mean
that you should be silent,

00:19:32.720 --> 00:19:35.120
because actually a lot of eyes
are on you, and especially

00:19:35.120 --> 00:19:37.190
for leaders, we are
watching leaders.

00:19:37.190 --> 00:19:40.400
We need to see who you are,
not just your fancy title

00:19:40.400 --> 00:19:41.990
or your big name.

00:19:41.990 --> 00:19:45.000
It's honestly so much
about your diversity story

00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:47.780
and when you
understood exclusion.

00:19:47.780 --> 00:19:49.675
And most people know
something about that.

00:19:49.675 --> 00:19:51.050
NICOLE FARKOUH:
One of the things

00:19:51.050 --> 00:19:52.600
that's striking me
as you're speaking

00:19:52.600 --> 00:19:55.280
is a polarity that I'm
seeing between power

00:19:55.280 --> 00:19:56.720
and vulnerability.

00:19:56.720 --> 00:19:59.570
And I imagine that you
have to kind of navigate

00:19:59.570 --> 00:20:03.660
both, flip between them,
stretch between, whatever it is.

00:20:03.660 --> 00:20:04.700
JENNIFER BROWN: Yes.

00:20:04.700 --> 00:20:07.241
NICOLE FARKOUH: And I'm curious
if that's a frame that you've

00:20:07.241 --> 00:20:08.507
thought about at all.

00:20:08.507 --> 00:20:09.590
JENNIFER BROWN: I like it.

00:20:09.590 --> 00:20:10.670
I like it.

00:20:10.670 --> 00:20:15.180
I'm envisioning a graphic
that I could mock up.

00:20:15.180 --> 00:20:18.660
But it's true,
especially for leaders

00:20:18.660 --> 00:20:23.570
for whom power meant
knowing all the answers,

00:20:23.570 --> 00:20:25.654
being seen as in charge.

00:20:25.654 --> 00:20:28.070
The vulnerability was the last
thing they wanted to share.

00:20:28.070 --> 00:20:30.860
And if any of you don't
know Brene Brown's work

00:20:30.860 --> 00:20:33.620
on vulnerability, she gave
a very famous TED Talk,

00:20:33.620 --> 00:20:36.410
and people nicknamed it
the vulnerability TED.

00:20:36.410 --> 00:20:38.900
And it was all about her
research around vulnerability

00:20:38.900 --> 00:20:41.000
and what a powerful
leadership tool it is,

00:20:41.000 --> 00:20:44.775
that is completely
underutilized.

00:20:44.775 --> 00:20:45.650
But it's interesting.

00:20:45.650 --> 00:20:47.600
Women being vulnerable
is different than men

00:20:47.600 --> 00:20:50.270
being vulnerable, different
than people of color

00:20:50.270 --> 00:20:51.860
being vulnerable.

00:20:51.860 --> 00:20:54.170
So the message sort of shifts.

00:20:54.170 --> 00:20:58.490
I mean, there's a degree of
risk of vulnerability for people

00:20:58.490 --> 00:21:01.744
who already have less power.

00:21:01.744 --> 00:21:02.660
NICOLE FARKOUH: Right.

00:21:02.660 --> 00:21:04.701
JENNIFER BROWN: So we've
got to be aware of that.

00:21:04.701 --> 00:21:07.430
But people with power, I
feel like there's no excuse

00:21:07.430 --> 00:21:08.769
not to show vulnerability.

00:21:08.769 --> 00:21:10.310
I mean, that's where
I get to be kind

00:21:10.310 --> 00:21:14.120
of ass kicker in the boardroom.

00:21:14.120 --> 00:21:15.035
You are safe.

00:21:17.630 --> 00:21:18.980
You're protected.

00:21:18.980 --> 00:21:21.140
And for you to kind
of go out on a limb

00:21:21.140 --> 00:21:23.840
looks very different than for
others to go out on a limb.

00:21:23.840 --> 00:21:26.060
And therefore, you have a
responsibility to do that.

00:21:26.060 --> 00:21:27.090
NICOLE FARKOUH: Yeah.

00:21:27.090 --> 00:21:30.077
And so that kind of leads me
into wanting to talk about one

00:21:30.077 --> 00:21:31.826
of the notions that
you cover a lot in you

00:21:31.826 --> 00:21:34.180
book is the change agent.

00:21:34.180 --> 00:21:36.842
And so I'm wondering if you can
just share a little bit about--

00:21:36.842 --> 00:21:39.300
I feel like we've been dancing
around that this whole time,

00:21:39.300 --> 00:21:40.830
that we've been talking
without naming it.

00:21:40.830 --> 00:21:43.200
So I want to name it and
invite you to talk about it

00:21:43.200 --> 00:21:43.780
a little bit.

00:21:43.780 --> 00:21:46.890
And how do you define
the change agent?

00:21:46.890 --> 00:21:49.420
And particularly in
a corporate space,

00:21:49.420 --> 00:21:51.120
what is the rule
of change agent?

00:21:51.120 --> 00:21:56.790
JENNIFER BROWN: Yeah, I love
the term because a lot of us

00:21:56.790 --> 00:22:00.150
feel called to challenge
a system around us.

00:22:00.150 --> 00:22:02.280
And wherever you sit
in the hierarchy--

00:22:02.280 --> 00:22:03.590
it doesn't need to be senior.

00:22:03.590 --> 00:22:07.410
It's a lot of junior people,
who are creating change

00:22:07.410 --> 00:22:09.630
from where they are and
influencing discussions that

00:22:09.630 --> 00:22:13.920
are going on and being
allies to their colleagues,

00:22:13.920 --> 00:22:17.640
volunteering to be part
of efforts and initiatives

00:22:17.640 --> 00:22:19.140
and things like that.

00:22:19.140 --> 00:22:24.330
So it's really anyone who
takes on the mantle of having

00:22:24.330 --> 00:22:27.510
courageous conversations,
showing up more boldly,

00:22:27.510 --> 00:22:29.730
speaking on behalf of
others when needed,

00:22:29.730 --> 00:22:31.990
speaking on behalf of
themselves honestly, and showing

00:22:31.990 --> 00:22:32.490
themselves.

00:22:32.490 --> 00:22:36.030
So even if-- especially
if we have stigmatized

00:22:36.030 --> 00:22:39.060
parts of who we are,
bringing those to the fore

00:22:39.060 --> 00:22:41.790
and really leading with them.

00:22:41.790 --> 00:22:44.280
And for me as a
change agent, I think

00:22:44.280 --> 00:22:47.657
you need to think of wherever
you are in the organization.

00:22:47.657 --> 00:22:49.740
Who are you trying to
influence, and what are they

00:22:49.740 --> 00:22:50.531
going to listen to?

00:22:50.531 --> 00:22:53.160
We have to be really good
at having a lot of tools

00:22:53.160 --> 00:22:53.870
at our disposal.

00:22:53.870 --> 00:22:56.610
Like I said before, if I
am in an executive room

00:22:56.610 --> 00:22:58.980
and I want to create
change, I've got to know--

00:22:58.980 --> 00:23:01.650
I like to know where is
everyone on this topic?

00:23:01.650 --> 00:23:03.840
Where are they
from early adopter,

00:23:03.840 --> 00:23:05.670
totally get it,
super enthusiastic,

00:23:05.670 --> 00:23:11.557
to kind of apathetic but
listening, to active resister,

00:23:11.557 --> 00:23:13.140
somebody who doesn't
show up, somebody

00:23:13.140 --> 00:23:16.140
who will show up and be
combative or challenging,

00:23:16.140 --> 00:23:17.890
even of the data.

00:23:17.890 --> 00:23:20.490
And so when you
think about how do

00:23:20.490 --> 00:23:22.700
I speak to each of these
groups differently,

00:23:22.700 --> 00:23:24.720
a really effective
change agent, I think,

00:23:24.720 --> 00:23:26.820
is somebody who can
shift their message

00:23:26.820 --> 00:23:28.710
and work with the listener.

00:23:28.710 --> 00:23:30.630
Because if we lose them--

00:23:30.630 --> 00:23:34.070
if we lose them, we lose our
mechanism to create change.

00:23:34.070 --> 00:23:36.150
But we need to keep
them differently.

00:23:36.150 --> 00:23:40.530
I think it's really interesting
work because, to me, it's

00:23:40.530 --> 00:23:42.180
audience analysis.

00:23:42.180 --> 00:23:43.530
And I enjoy that a lot.

00:23:43.530 --> 00:23:45.650
I enjoy trying to
figure out where

00:23:45.650 --> 00:23:49.731
are people, what are
the questions they have,

00:23:49.731 --> 00:23:51.930
what are the
triggers for change?

00:23:51.930 --> 00:23:54.030
I write a lot about
that in the book.

00:23:54.030 --> 00:23:56.880
When companies call us,
there's a host of reasons why.

00:23:56.880 --> 00:23:59.430
They call us because
they're ready for change.

00:23:59.430 --> 00:24:03.480
It can be anything from the
CEO came from like an Amex

00:24:03.480 --> 00:24:07.069
and is moving over to, say,
a fast growth tech company.

00:24:07.069 --> 00:24:09.110
And they'll be, like, what
is going on right now?

00:24:09.110 --> 00:24:11.068
Like, I came from this
company to this company,

00:24:11.068 --> 00:24:14.820
and I went from a totally
kind of baked mature strategy

00:24:14.820 --> 00:24:18.060
that everybody understood
to literally nothing.

00:24:18.060 --> 00:24:21.060
And so that CEO will say,
this is not acceptable.

00:24:21.060 --> 00:24:22.650
We've got to get on the train.

00:24:22.650 --> 00:24:24.899
And so they may
call us and say we

00:24:24.899 --> 00:24:26.440
got to build-- what
I had over there,

00:24:26.440 --> 00:24:27.648
we've got to build over here.

00:24:27.648 --> 00:24:29.610
Or they may be a very
competitive person.

00:24:29.610 --> 00:24:31.930
They might look at their
industry ecosystem and say,

00:24:31.930 --> 00:24:33.870
well, we're behind
them, them, and them,

00:24:33.870 --> 00:24:36.400
and I'm not OK with that,
so we got to catch up.

00:24:36.400 --> 00:24:37.115
That's also good.

00:24:37.115 --> 00:24:38.490
I mean, I don't
know if I believe

00:24:38.490 --> 00:24:42.270
it's the most altruistic reason
in the world, but I'll take it.

00:24:42.270 --> 00:24:43.770
Sometimes it's a
personal reason.

00:24:43.770 --> 00:24:48.000
Sometimes if it's a male CEO
with daughters and somebody

00:24:48.000 --> 00:24:52.710
who's been intimately courtside
around equal opportunity

00:24:52.710 --> 00:24:56.370
for women and girls
and has a personal need

00:24:56.370 --> 00:25:00.570
to leave a legacy that is
better than what they're seeing.

00:25:00.570 --> 00:25:03.930
And sometimes CEOs get really
galvanized around the pay gap,

00:25:03.930 --> 00:25:04.600
for example.

00:25:04.600 --> 00:25:08.070
Many companies don't even
know what their pay gap is.

00:25:08.070 --> 00:25:10.620
They know, but it's
closely guarded in HR

00:25:10.620 --> 00:25:12.480
and not really shouted
from the rooftops.

00:25:12.480 --> 00:25:15.992
But then you've got Marc
Benioff at Salesforce,

00:25:15.992 --> 00:25:18.450
who's the CEO there, who's
doing some really radical things

00:25:18.450 --> 00:25:19.740
around pay gap stuff.

00:25:19.740 --> 00:25:22.470
He's wrote a check
for $3 million

00:25:22.470 --> 00:25:25.770
just to gross up pay for all
the people that were underpaid,

00:25:25.770 --> 00:25:28.350
and that was kind of
just his first salvo

00:25:28.350 --> 00:25:30.570
in the conversation and
then, at the same time,

00:25:30.570 --> 00:25:34.170
sort of tackling the systemic
problems that led to that.

00:25:34.170 --> 00:25:39.130
So there are-- everybody is sort
of on this big long continuum.

00:25:39.130 --> 00:25:43.600
And I think you've got to meet
your organization where they're

00:25:43.600 --> 00:25:44.100
at.

00:25:44.100 --> 00:25:46.141
You've got to meet your
manager where they're at.

00:25:46.141 --> 00:25:48.240
You've got to meet your
team where they're at.

00:25:48.240 --> 00:25:51.930
Start local, start
to suggest that we

00:25:51.930 --> 00:25:53.580
have open dialogue
about this stuff

00:25:53.580 --> 00:25:56.430
and build a container for it.

00:25:56.430 --> 00:25:59.070
Somehow think about-- there's
a lot of suggestions in here

00:25:59.070 --> 00:26:01.410
about what you can do at
your level, whatever that is,

00:26:01.410 --> 00:26:02.820
to create change.

00:26:02.820 --> 00:26:07.830
But know that the
big organizations

00:26:07.830 --> 00:26:12.930
need pretty sophisticated
structures to really shift

00:26:12.930 --> 00:26:14.100
a culture towards inclusion.

00:26:14.100 --> 00:26:17.100
I mean, it's one of
those things that--

00:26:17.100 --> 00:26:20.430
it's fascinating how
does a huge company that

00:26:20.430 --> 00:26:22.560
is growing and
surviving and dealing

00:26:22.560 --> 00:26:26.240
with new markets and everything
shift towards inclusion.

00:26:26.240 --> 00:26:30.030
It's way more complex than like
hiring and fixing your problem

00:26:30.030 --> 00:26:31.680
by hiring x number
of this, this,

00:26:31.680 --> 00:26:36.110
and this, who, by the way,
won't stay if your culture isn't

00:26:36.110 --> 00:26:36.779
inclusive.

00:26:36.779 --> 00:26:38.820
So you've kind of solved
one part of the problem,

00:26:38.820 --> 00:26:40.980
but then you haven't
actually adjusted the culture

00:26:40.980 --> 00:26:43.344
so that they will stay
and grow and thrive.

00:26:43.344 --> 00:26:44.760
NICOLE FARKOUH:
So that's actually

00:26:44.760 --> 00:26:46.430
a segue into a question
that I had for you.

00:26:46.430 --> 00:26:47.430
And there's a quote
in the book where

00:26:47.430 --> 00:26:50.400
you write, "Great intentions at
the top of the house, and even

00:26:50.400 --> 00:26:53.160
great actions," like we've seen
publicly, where companies are

00:26:53.160 --> 00:26:55.890
taking a stand
politically, whether it's

00:26:55.890 --> 00:26:58.322
against the Muslim ban
or Black Lives Matter

00:26:58.322 --> 00:27:00.030
or issues that are
coming up in the news,

00:27:00.030 --> 00:27:03.266
and companies are taking
public stands against those.

00:27:03.266 --> 00:27:04.890
"Great actions at
the top of the house,

00:27:04.890 --> 00:27:06.810
great scores on all
the indices and lists,

00:27:06.810 --> 00:27:08.820
and a whole host
of awards do not

00:27:08.820 --> 00:27:10.620
guarantee a healthy
culture for all."

00:27:10.620 --> 00:27:12.810
There's a big difference
between talking the talk

00:27:12.810 --> 00:27:14.170
and walking the walk.

00:27:14.170 --> 00:27:17.430
So what is your recipe
for moving a company

00:27:17.430 --> 00:27:18.630
to walking the walk?

00:27:18.630 --> 00:27:21.380
JENNIFER BROWN: You
love the hard questions.

00:27:21.380 --> 00:27:22.300
NICOLE FARKOUH: Told you I
wasn't going to be easy on you.

00:27:22.300 --> 00:27:22.930
JENNIFER BROWN: No, I like it.

00:27:22.930 --> 00:27:23.513
No, I love it.

00:27:23.513 --> 00:27:24.030
I love it.

00:27:24.030 --> 00:27:27.180
Yeah, well, so what
happens is, companies

00:27:27.180 --> 00:27:29.520
can buy a lot of
really fancy marketing.

00:27:29.520 --> 00:27:32.640
They can even be really well
intentioned and actually

00:27:32.640 --> 00:27:34.710
really active in social
issues, although I

00:27:34.710 --> 00:27:38.580
have to say most companies
don't say anything about what's

00:27:38.580 --> 00:27:40.800
going on in the political
realm, Black Lives

00:27:40.800 --> 00:27:42.120
Matter, the Muslim ban.

00:27:42.120 --> 00:27:44.160
I mean, most were silent.

00:27:44.160 --> 00:27:46.080
And I can tell you
that a lot of employees

00:27:46.080 --> 00:27:52.860
were walking around feeling
really jittery and distressed,

00:27:52.860 --> 00:27:55.170
and that they had to
kind of hide all of that

00:27:55.170 --> 00:27:57.270
as they came into work
in the last six months

00:27:57.270 --> 00:27:58.920
at various junctures,
depending on what

00:27:58.920 --> 00:28:01.378
has been happening-- in the
last year and a half, actually.

00:28:01.378 --> 00:28:06.120
So I think until
leadership especially

00:28:06.120 --> 00:28:09.780
realizes that it's not
about-- it's not always

00:28:09.780 --> 00:28:12.330
about the grand public
gesture, although they actually

00:28:12.330 --> 00:28:15.840
need to do that more, and that's
nowhere near as widespread as I

00:28:15.840 --> 00:28:17.040
like to see it.

00:28:17.040 --> 00:28:19.890
Even just the email
to an all hands,

00:28:19.890 --> 00:28:23.900
even the inclusion of an honest
discussion about inclusion,

00:28:23.900 --> 00:28:28.170
even town halls and
dialogues and just a space

00:28:28.170 --> 00:28:30.390
to talk about it is
something that I think

00:28:30.390 --> 00:28:34.170
a lot of legal departments
are jittery about in most

00:28:34.170 --> 00:28:37.260
of the-- now, here maybe not,
but a lot of the companies I

00:28:37.260 --> 00:28:40.150
work with are-- they want
to stay away from it.

00:28:40.150 --> 00:28:42.210
But the silence
really speaks volumes.

00:28:42.210 --> 00:28:45.510
And I know that
people are looking

00:28:45.510 --> 00:28:50.360
for leadership in those times
to really speak about why--

00:28:50.360 --> 00:28:53.940
what I want to hear is why am I
important to you working here,

00:28:53.940 --> 00:28:55.500
like it's really human.

00:28:55.500 --> 00:28:57.210
It's very much, am I seen?

00:28:57.210 --> 00:28:58.360
Am I heard?

00:28:58.360 --> 00:29:00.674
Am I understood?

00:29:00.674 --> 00:29:02.340
Even if leadership
doesn't look like me,

00:29:02.340 --> 00:29:04.839
and even if it's not from my
community, which typically it's

00:29:04.839 --> 00:29:08.760
not, I still want to
hear those messages.

00:29:08.760 --> 00:29:11.572
And I want them to be heartfelt
and authentic and vulnerable.

00:29:11.572 --> 00:29:13.530
And even if leaders don't
have all the answers,

00:29:13.530 --> 00:29:15.488
they need to say, I don't
have all the answers,

00:29:15.488 --> 00:29:19.419
and yet I'm committed to
finding them out together,

00:29:19.419 --> 00:29:20.460
just something like that.

00:29:20.460 --> 00:29:22.766
It is not about taking
political stands.

00:29:22.766 --> 00:29:24.390
I think a lot of
companies stayed quiet

00:29:24.390 --> 00:29:26.190
because they thought
there was just no way

00:29:26.190 --> 00:29:28.650
to talk about these
things without coming out

00:29:28.650 --> 00:29:29.800
on one side or the other.

00:29:29.800 --> 00:29:30.540
And it wasn't about that.

00:29:30.540 --> 00:29:32.040
I think inclusion
and inclusiveness

00:29:32.040 --> 00:29:37.640
is sort of a universal topic
that we can all talk about.

00:29:37.640 --> 00:29:39.570
So I think to walk
the talk, it's

00:29:39.570 --> 00:29:43.110
got to be heartfelt.
It has to be--

00:29:43.110 --> 00:29:46.290
we've got to have the hard
conversations inside and not

00:29:46.290 --> 00:29:50.880
just go for the big pop
on the external metrics,

00:29:50.880 --> 00:29:54.120
although we need to do
more of that too, trust me.

00:29:54.120 --> 00:29:55.740
I mean, the vast
majority of companies

00:29:55.740 --> 00:29:57.990
aren't doing anything
in any of these lists.

00:29:57.990 --> 00:29:59.910
NICOLE FARKOUH: Yeah.

00:29:59.910 --> 00:30:01.759
So I have a whole set
of other questions

00:30:01.759 --> 00:30:03.300
that I'm dying to
ask you, but I also

00:30:03.300 --> 00:30:05.250
want to open up the
floor to anyone else that

00:30:05.250 --> 00:30:10.144
wants to ask questions,
either on the live stream or--

00:30:10.144 --> 00:30:11.352
JENNIFER BROWN: Yeah, please.

00:30:11.352 --> 00:30:12.090
NICOLE FARKOUH: --in the room.

00:30:12.090 --> 00:30:13.790
JENNIFER BROWN: We'd
love to hear from you.

00:30:13.790 --> 00:30:15.331
NICOLE FARKOUH: And
I'm happy to keep

00:30:15.331 --> 00:30:18.450
going if no one's thought
of anything yet to ask.

00:30:18.450 --> 00:30:21.034
JENNIFER BROWN: I see a lot of
shaking head out there, though.

00:30:21.034 --> 00:30:22.825
NICOLE FARKOUH: Does
anyone have a question

00:30:22.825 --> 00:30:23.866
that they'd like to ask?

00:30:23.866 --> 00:30:26.029
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:30:26.029 --> 00:30:28.320
NICOLE FARKOUH: OK, wait,
let's get you a mic because--

00:30:28.320 --> 00:30:28.820
JENNIFER BROWN: There you go.

00:30:28.820 --> 00:30:31.150
NICOLE FARKOUH: --we need
to have for the recording.

00:30:31.150 --> 00:30:33.004
JENNIFER BROWN: That's right.

00:30:33.004 --> 00:30:33.670
AUDIENCE: Hello.

00:30:33.670 --> 00:30:34.878
JENNIFER BROWN: Hello, hello.

00:30:34.878 --> 00:30:37.710
AUDIENCE: Hi, I'm [? Kashima. ?]
You quoted several books

00:30:37.710 --> 00:30:40.390
and people that you follow
on TED talks and whatnot,

00:30:40.390 --> 00:30:42.780
and so I was just wondering,
are there certain people

00:30:42.780 --> 00:30:44.140
that influence you?

00:30:44.140 --> 00:30:46.229
I mean, I know your father
was a major influencer.

00:30:46.229 --> 00:30:48.770
JENNIFER BROWN: Yes, maybe for
not the right reasons, though.

00:30:48.770 --> 00:30:50.650
AUDIENCE: And things happening
with your voice or whatnot,

00:30:50.650 --> 00:30:52.680
but were there certain people
that you followed and looked up

00:30:52.680 --> 00:30:54.510
to that helped you could
get to where you are now?

00:30:54.510 --> 00:30:56.385
JENNIFER BROWN: Boy,
that's a great question.

00:31:05.870 --> 00:31:09.640
Well, I'd probably say there
are some leading chief diversity

00:31:09.640 --> 00:31:12.010
officers that I've had
the privilege to work

00:31:12.010 --> 00:31:15.070
with in so many
different companies

00:31:15.070 --> 00:31:18.880
that I've worked in
that are fearlessly

00:31:18.880 --> 00:31:23.380
leading their company with
not a lot of resources.

00:31:23.380 --> 00:31:27.660
It's a really, really
hard job to do these jobs.

00:31:27.660 --> 00:31:29.230
You constantly are
sort of in doubt

00:31:29.230 --> 00:31:32.890
in terms of the legitimacy of
what you're actually doing,

00:31:32.890 --> 00:31:34.420
and there's so much pushback.

00:31:34.420 --> 00:31:35.890
So you spend so
much of your time

00:31:35.890 --> 00:31:39.140
trying to figure out, how
do I, again, steer the ship

00:31:39.140 --> 00:31:41.950
and get it to move.

00:31:41.950 --> 00:31:46.030
So I was always following
the diversity leaders

00:31:46.030 --> 00:31:48.730
at companies like
IBM and Wells Fargo

00:31:48.730 --> 00:31:52.610
and a lot of financial services
companies, honestly, who

00:31:52.610 --> 00:31:55.690
have been doing this for
a really long time, longer

00:31:55.690 --> 00:31:56.740
than the tech space.

00:31:56.740 --> 00:31:59.670
And I think more
deeply and more widely.

00:31:59.670 --> 00:32:02.920
They've sort of baked
it into their structure.

00:32:02.920 --> 00:32:07.180
And so I've learned a lot from
those really advanced cultures

00:32:07.180 --> 00:32:09.310
that have been going after
this for a long time.

00:32:09.310 --> 00:32:10.900
And you know
listening to CEOs, who

00:32:10.900 --> 00:32:13.390
talk about diversity and
inclusion and sort of carefully

00:32:13.390 --> 00:32:16.630
monitoring how do they talk
about it so that I can then

00:32:16.630 --> 00:32:19.720
take that and teach other
CEOs and executives how

00:32:19.720 --> 00:32:20.830
to talk about it.

00:32:20.830 --> 00:32:24.430
Jim Turley, who was the
CEO of Ernst and Young,

00:32:24.430 --> 00:32:28.600
was a really amazing guy,
especially on LGBT rights.

00:32:28.600 --> 00:32:32.620
And he was a straight
white cisgender man,

00:32:32.620 --> 00:32:35.860
leading this massive global
company that was very, very

00:32:35.860 --> 00:32:39.340
adamant about LGBT
equality and gender

00:32:39.340 --> 00:32:40.610
equality in his workforce.

00:32:40.610 --> 00:32:43.400
And so just getting to
interview him on the stage

00:32:43.400 --> 00:32:44.620
was really cool.

00:32:44.620 --> 00:32:47.800
And honestly, it's kept me
going because those people like

00:32:47.800 --> 00:32:51.550
him give me hope that there
are more of them out there

00:32:51.550 --> 00:32:52.581
that are--

00:32:52.581 --> 00:32:53.830
they're on the learning curve.

00:32:53.830 --> 00:32:54.829
They're on that journey.

00:32:54.829 --> 00:33:00.190
They need to be either awakened
or equipped or maybe made

00:33:00.190 --> 00:33:04.780
comfortable with being a
spokesperson for these things.

00:33:04.780 --> 00:33:06.046
So I think they were really--

00:33:06.046 --> 00:33:07.420
meeting people
like that has been

00:33:07.420 --> 00:33:08.890
really transformative
for me, because I

00:33:08.890 --> 00:33:09.980
know that it can happen.

00:33:09.980 --> 00:33:12.222
We just need to
create more of them,

00:33:12.222 --> 00:33:13.930
and that's the big
thing that keeps me up

00:33:13.930 --> 00:33:18.640
at night, is how do I ignite
leaders that look like him

00:33:18.640 --> 00:33:21.100
to speak about these
things so that it makes

00:33:21.100 --> 00:33:23.585
it safe for the rest of us
to really show up and bring

00:33:23.585 --> 00:33:25.210
our full selves to
work, because that's

00:33:25.210 --> 00:33:26.740
going to really shift it.

00:33:28.720 --> 00:33:30.970
NICOLE FARKOUH: I'm going
to ask a follow-up question.

00:33:30.970 --> 00:33:32.661
If anyone has a
question, raise your hand

00:33:32.661 --> 00:33:33.660
and we'll get you the mic.

00:33:33.660 --> 00:33:36.326
But it's interesting to hear you
say that the financial services

00:33:36.326 --> 00:33:38.607
industry has been doing
this work for a long time

00:33:38.607 --> 00:33:40.440
and deeply, because
that's not necessarily--

00:33:40.440 --> 00:33:40.890
JENNIFER BROWN: What we think.

00:33:40.890 --> 00:33:41.160
NICOLE FARKOUH:
--the industry that I

00:33:41.160 --> 00:33:44.290
would think of as a
particularly inclusive industry.

00:33:44.290 --> 00:33:47.049
So I'm curious-- it's
interesting to hear

00:33:47.049 --> 00:33:47.590
you say that.

00:33:47.590 --> 00:33:50.790
And I'm curious what the
impact of that investment

00:33:50.790 --> 00:33:54.360
has been in those companies.

00:33:54.360 --> 00:33:56.970
What do you see when you're
in there doing that work?

00:33:56.970 --> 00:33:57.886
JENNIFER BROWN: Right.

00:33:57.886 --> 00:34:03.420
Well, I mean, you see a lot
of employee resource groups

00:34:03.420 --> 00:34:07.200
that are really huge,
like they're just massive.

00:34:07.200 --> 00:34:09.000
Like, they have
tens of thousands

00:34:09.000 --> 00:34:11.317
of people in them kind
of big with their own--

00:34:11.317 --> 00:34:12.900
they're sort of a
city unto themselves

00:34:12.900 --> 00:34:14.010
with their own org charts.

00:34:14.010 --> 00:34:15.600
They have lots of
executive buy-in.

00:34:15.600 --> 00:34:19.199
There's multiple levels
of steering committees

00:34:19.199 --> 00:34:23.520
and executive councils
in different parts

00:34:23.520 --> 00:34:24.310
of the business.

00:34:24.310 --> 00:34:26.219
So it's really baked out.

00:34:26.219 --> 00:34:29.190
If you were envisioning
it, it's got arms and legs

00:34:29.190 --> 00:34:31.500
at different levels and
especially the penetration,

00:34:31.500 --> 00:34:33.690
I think, to the senior levels.

00:34:33.690 --> 00:34:38.219
And Wells Fargo, for example,
is investing in diverse talent

00:34:38.219 --> 00:34:41.850
by graduating thousands
of diverse leaders

00:34:41.850 --> 00:34:44.370
through a particular leadership
development program that

00:34:44.370 --> 00:34:47.199
is just for each segment.

00:34:47.199 --> 00:34:50.610
And I'm involved in their LGBT
program, where we've graduated

00:34:50.610 --> 00:34:52.530
500 high potential leaders.

00:34:52.530 --> 00:34:55.080
I'm not seeing that in tech.

00:34:55.080 --> 00:34:56.100
We need it desperately.

00:34:56.100 --> 00:34:57.600
We need it in every
single industry.

00:34:57.600 --> 00:34:59.620
It doesn't matter which one.

00:34:59.620 --> 00:35:02.460
And the fact they've graduated
thousands of black leaders

00:35:02.460 --> 00:35:04.260
through their high
potential program.

00:35:04.260 --> 00:35:06.030
And these are people
that are mid-career.

00:35:06.030 --> 00:35:08.100
They're in that
really critical time,

00:35:08.100 --> 00:35:11.640
where they need to kind of sit
back in a homogeneous group

00:35:11.640 --> 00:35:14.160
and say, here's what's
getting in the way for me

00:35:14.160 --> 00:35:17.220
for my career, and
here's my peers,

00:35:17.220 --> 00:35:18.750
and we share these experiences.

00:35:18.750 --> 00:35:21.660
How can we think
about shortcutting

00:35:21.660 --> 00:35:23.640
this, whether bias
is showing up,

00:35:23.640 --> 00:35:26.580
or who can we leverage
on the plus side that

00:35:26.580 --> 00:35:28.470
is supportive of
who's your mentor?

00:35:28.470 --> 00:35:29.830
Who's your sponsor?

00:35:29.830 --> 00:35:31.330
Could I have lunch
with that person?

00:35:31.330 --> 00:35:32.746
So the whole
networking thing that

00:35:32.746 --> 00:35:36.600
happens amongst these
communities behind closed doors

00:35:36.600 --> 00:35:37.665
shores up that community.

00:35:37.665 --> 00:35:41.340
It gives that community a voice,
and gives them confidence,

00:35:41.340 --> 00:35:43.670
and it makes them feel
important to the company.

00:35:43.670 --> 00:35:44.250
So it's like this
really cool thing.

00:35:44.250 --> 00:35:45.465
NICOLE FARKOUH: And
is it moving them

00:35:45.465 --> 00:35:45.840
up in the leadership ladder?

00:35:45.840 --> 00:35:46.620
JENNIFER BROWN: Yes, it is.

00:35:46.620 --> 00:35:47.190
NICOLE FARKOUH: It is.

00:35:47.190 --> 00:35:47.790
JENNIFER BROWN: The promotions.

00:35:47.790 --> 00:35:50.550
So the promotion rates for Wells
coming out of these programs

00:35:50.550 --> 00:35:54.360
are way higher than average
promotion rates for people

00:35:54.360 --> 00:35:56.010
who haven't been through them.

00:35:56.010 --> 00:36:00.450
So to me, I interpret
that as it's the lift.

00:36:00.450 --> 00:36:01.530
It's the investment.

00:36:01.530 --> 00:36:06.210
It's the deep dive
into our journeys,

00:36:06.210 --> 00:36:08.370
but it's a safe space to
talk about those things.

00:36:08.370 --> 00:36:10.755
And for the LGBT community,
the conversations

00:36:10.755 --> 00:36:13.650
are around authenticity,
bringing your full self

00:36:13.650 --> 00:36:17.490
to work, how exhausting it
is to cover and minimize

00:36:17.490 --> 00:36:19.770
your life in front
of your customers

00:36:19.770 --> 00:36:23.010
and your branch in the
Midwest or wherever they are.

00:36:23.010 --> 00:36:24.720
It's a really
honest conversation.

00:36:24.720 --> 00:36:30.510
Or we talk a lot about if
you're a lesbian, not looking

00:36:30.510 --> 00:36:33.180
like, maybe, I don't know--
like not fitting somebody's

00:36:33.180 --> 00:36:36.090
idea of what a successful
woman leader looks like,

00:36:36.090 --> 00:36:41.460
or a gay man saying, I get this
feedback around how I speak

00:36:41.460 --> 00:36:43.040
or how I gesture.

00:36:43.040 --> 00:36:45.930
I mean, it's really ridiculous
stuff, but it's real.

00:36:45.930 --> 00:36:49.950
And I think we're still fighting
against this monolithic idea

00:36:49.950 --> 00:36:52.950
of what a leader looks like, and
a lot of us don't fit in that.

00:36:52.950 --> 00:36:58.220
And so bias is still keeping us
from achieving what we really

00:36:58.220 --> 00:36:58.720
should.

00:36:58.720 --> 00:37:01.800
But we've got to take
control of that and name it.

00:37:01.800 --> 00:37:04.800
And then kind of be
really savvy about how

00:37:04.800 --> 00:37:08.460
we navigate around it, through
it, using our allies to help

00:37:08.460 --> 00:37:10.002
us, et cetera.

00:37:10.002 --> 00:37:10.930
Yes.

00:37:10.930 --> 00:37:11.430
Yes.

00:37:16.315 --> 00:37:17.690
AUDIENCE: So kind
of off what you

00:37:17.690 --> 00:37:20.940
were saying around the
shift in what a leader looks

00:37:20.940 --> 00:37:23.520
like, my question
is around, you know,

00:37:23.520 --> 00:37:25.830
we're shifting away from any--

00:37:25.830 --> 00:37:29.160
or hoping to shift from bias of
what a leader previously looked

00:37:29.160 --> 00:37:29.730
like.

00:37:29.730 --> 00:37:31.800
But isn't this still
in a way a construct

00:37:31.800 --> 00:37:34.600
of how a leader should show up
and thinking about inclusivity

00:37:34.600 --> 00:37:36.690
and bringing your
full self to work?

00:37:36.690 --> 00:37:40.050
If someone's not necessarily
extroverted or the type who

00:37:40.050 --> 00:37:43.110
feels comfortable to be
sharing these types of stories,

00:37:43.110 --> 00:37:45.140
how do you mitigate
that balance of making

00:37:45.140 --> 00:37:46.890
sure we're inclusive
in a leadership group

00:37:46.890 --> 00:37:48.825
but also having the
responsibility to show up

00:37:48.825 --> 00:37:50.200
in the way that
you've described?

00:37:50.200 --> 00:37:51.074
JENNIFER BROWN: Yeah.

00:37:51.074 --> 00:37:52.930
Oh, that's a great question.

00:37:52.930 --> 00:37:56.050
That's a tough one.

00:37:56.050 --> 00:37:58.740
I have to think about
that a little bit more.

00:37:58.740 --> 00:38:02.281
It's true that this is a little
bit of an extrovert's model,

00:38:02.281 --> 00:38:02.780
right?

00:38:02.780 --> 00:38:07.480
It's especially hard to expect
an introvert or somebody who

00:38:07.480 --> 00:38:11.500
is a little more
analytical to even come

00:38:11.500 --> 00:38:12.850
to the table with their story.

00:38:12.850 --> 00:38:14.410
And vulnerability
means something

00:38:14.410 --> 00:38:17.720
totally different to that person
and feels like way more risky.

00:38:17.720 --> 00:38:20.080
I think that's very true.

00:38:20.080 --> 00:38:22.510
My friend Wokie Nwabueze--

00:38:22.510 --> 00:38:25.300
I have a podcast, and
Wokie was on my podcast.

00:38:25.300 --> 00:38:28.090
And she has the Seen
and Heard Project.

00:38:28.090 --> 00:38:31.480
And she describes it
as being the quiet.

00:38:31.480 --> 00:38:33.340
She's the quiet girl.

00:38:33.340 --> 00:38:38.410
And Seen and Heard is all
about the quiet voices, right?

00:38:38.410 --> 00:38:41.430
So that we're not ever
going to be the one that's

00:38:41.430 --> 00:38:44.650
on edge of the
stage, maybe being

00:38:44.650 --> 00:38:47.449
that loud leader or
the expressive leader,

00:38:47.449 --> 00:38:49.240
but we're going to lead
in a different way,

00:38:49.240 --> 00:38:50.860
and yet we still
have an opportunity

00:38:50.860 --> 00:38:51.820
to lead and stretch.

00:38:51.820 --> 00:38:56.560
So what does our edge look
like when that's our profile?

00:38:56.560 --> 00:39:00.090
And I guess my
answer would be that,

00:39:00.090 --> 00:39:02.790
how can a leader who's a
quieter leader, or someone who

00:39:02.790 --> 00:39:04.950
leads from behind, or
someone that's analytical,

00:39:04.950 --> 00:39:08.740
still work their edge, which
is really the biggest point.

00:39:08.740 --> 00:39:11.910
And by the way,
showing up that way

00:39:11.910 --> 00:39:13.590
is going to resonate
with people that

00:39:13.590 --> 00:39:17.460
need to see that leader
showing up that way, right?

00:39:17.460 --> 00:39:19.290
I always say, if we're
not uncomfortable

00:39:19.290 --> 00:39:22.140
on a regular basis, from
wherever we're starting,

00:39:22.140 --> 00:39:25.440
we're not probably
doing our work.

00:39:25.440 --> 00:39:27.650
But the definition of what
uncomfortable looks like

00:39:27.650 --> 00:39:30.050
feels different for all of us.

00:39:30.050 --> 00:39:31.970
But yeah, I really
appreciate that question.

00:39:31.970 --> 00:39:33.620
It doesn't look the
same for everyone.

00:39:33.620 --> 00:39:37.940
Quiet advocacy, noisy advocacy--

00:39:37.940 --> 00:39:41.690
I think leading when
no one's looking.

00:39:41.690 --> 00:39:45.710
And yet you can be an
incredibly inclusive leader

00:39:45.710 --> 00:39:49.190
in a quiet way by the questions
you ask, the listening that you

00:39:49.190 --> 00:39:53.990
provide, the way that
you represent inclusion

00:39:53.990 --> 00:39:56.090
that maybe nobody ever
sees, but that they

00:39:56.090 --> 00:39:57.800
experience the impact of.

00:39:57.800 --> 00:40:00.410
And that's beautiful
and important.

00:40:00.410 --> 00:40:03.411
I would say get others
to tell your story.

00:40:03.411 --> 00:40:04.910
And that's why I
tell Wokie's story,

00:40:04.910 --> 00:40:09.390
because that's my way of
signaling to people that you

00:40:09.390 --> 00:40:10.440
have a role as well.

00:40:10.440 --> 00:40:11.550
It's really important.

00:40:11.550 --> 00:40:13.800
And that's going to shift
the reality for other people

00:40:13.800 --> 00:40:15.860
that may not be shifted
by me and my style,

00:40:15.860 --> 00:40:17.934
but may be shifted by you.

00:40:17.934 --> 00:40:19.350
NICOLE FARKOUH:
So that's actually

00:40:19.350 --> 00:40:20.850
a great transition to
another question that's

00:40:20.850 --> 00:40:22.050
kind of percolating for me.

00:40:22.050 --> 00:40:24.844
And again, raise your hand
if there's a question.

00:40:24.844 --> 00:40:25.760
We'll get you the mic.

00:40:25.760 --> 00:40:27.426
But in the meantime,
I'll fill the space

00:40:27.426 --> 00:40:31.570
with my question,
which is, how do you

00:40:31.570 --> 00:40:35.560
dance between
fighting to establish

00:40:35.560 --> 00:40:40.120
your credibility and your
power and being the voice,

00:40:40.120 --> 00:40:43.240
exerting your voice,
and also creating

00:40:43.240 --> 00:40:46.810
this space for other people to
exert their voice, who maybe

00:40:46.810 --> 00:40:47.770
have less power?

00:40:47.770 --> 00:40:51.490
Like, how do you navigate that?

00:40:51.490 --> 00:40:53.630
JENNIFER BROWN: Oh,
I love that question.

00:40:53.630 --> 00:40:55.390
Oh, man, it's so true.

00:40:58.300 --> 00:41:01.450
Well, we all have
a different style.

00:41:01.450 --> 00:41:04.870
So I am actually, even
though I keynote a lot,

00:41:04.870 --> 00:41:08.020
I'm actually more of a
question asker versus a talker.

00:41:08.020 --> 00:41:09.530
I'm more of a--

00:41:09.530 --> 00:41:10.990
I love focus groups.

00:41:10.990 --> 00:41:13.300
I love interviewing people.

00:41:13.300 --> 00:41:15.790
I like my podcast, not
because I get the platform,

00:41:15.790 --> 00:41:19.530
but because I can give
other people the platform.

00:41:19.530 --> 00:41:21.040
But there are some
times when I am

00:41:21.040 --> 00:41:23.620
called to be the
definitive voice,

00:41:23.620 --> 00:41:26.890
the one with the credibility,
the one that wrote the book.

00:41:26.890 --> 00:41:30.130
Even though I will say
the book is nowhere near,

00:41:30.130 --> 00:41:33.110
and it couldn't ever
be a perfect solution,

00:41:33.110 --> 00:41:36.430
it's just one person's
lens and experience.

00:41:36.430 --> 00:41:39.550
So I think it as
a change agent, we

00:41:39.550 --> 00:41:44.100
need to understand what
does this moment need of me?

00:41:44.100 --> 00:41:46.530
How can I be in
service right now?

00:41:46.530 --> 00:41:47.970
Is it to listen?

00:41:47.970 --> 00:41:50.250
Is it to support
others, or is it

00:41:50.250 --> 00:41:53.980
to come through with the
statement or the power--

00:41:53.980 --> 00:41:56.280
show the power really?

00:41:56.280 --> 00:41:57.900
And I don't even mean--

00:41:57.900 --> 00:42:00.180
we can show power
just with our bodies

00:42:00.180 --> 00:42:03.000
and our voice and our presence.

00:42:03.000 --> 00:42:06.150
I'm very conscious of
using the power differently

00:42:06.150 --> 00:42:08.520
if I'm walking into a room
with employee resource groups

00:42:08.520 --> 00:42:15.540
and it's lively and
open and informal,

00:42:15.540 --> 00:42:18.481
how does my power need
to show up in that

00:42:18.481 --> 00:42:19.480
in a very different way?

00:42:19.480 --> 00:42:22.560
But if I'm walking into
a room with executives,

00:42:22.560 --> 00:42:25.110
how you walk in, how
you speak, how you

00:42:25.110 --> 00:42:27.810
use your voice,
what you say really

00:42:27.810 --> 00:42:29.370
matters because you meet--

00:42:29.370 --> 00:42:33.120
in my experience, you meet
power with power, frankly.

00:42:33.120 --> 00:42:37.610
So you've got to learn
how to kind of get

00:42:37.610 --> 00:42:40.820
your grounding in
that kind of room

00:42:40.820 --> 00:42:43.010
and use your vulnerability,
but you're always,

00:42:43.010 --> 00:42:46.250
always watching how to
be savvy about it, right?

00:42:46.250 --> 00:42:47.960
It's a tool in your arsenal.

00:42:47.960 --> 00:42:50.390
You can't fall apart in
an executive meeting.

00:42:50.390 --> 00:42:53.210
I mean, this is part of, I
think, owning your story.

00:42:53.210 --> 00:42:55.010
Like, when I gave my
TED Talk, I thought,

00:42:55.010 --> 00:42:58.100
how am I going to get up
on that stage and not cry?

00:42:58.100 --> 00:43:00.650
I was, like, am I going
to get through my talk?

00:43:00.650 --> 00:43:04.060
And I was really
worried about that.

00:43:04.060 --> 00:43:08.980
But as you make your
stories your tool,

00:43:08.980 --> 00:43:11.260
you learn how to protect
yourself at the same time

00:43:11.260 --> 00:43:14.499
as you are being vulnerable
and you're reliving

00:43:14.499 --> 00:43:15.790
something that happened to you.

00:43:15.790 --> 00:43:18.550
But you're always mindful
and kind of watching

00:43:18.550 --> 00:43:21.310
from a distance to see,
how is this going over?

00:43:21.310 --> 00:43:23.440
I'm giving you guys
all of my tricks.

00:43:23.440 --> 00:43:25.390
But this is,
honestly-- this is how

00:43:25.390 --> 00:43:30.010
I think about it, because
your stories become your tools

00:43:30.010 --> 00:43:33.520
and bringing them
out strategically

00:43:33.520 --> 00:43:38.140
and at the right moment leads
to a sense of power and mastery

00:43:38.140 --> 00:43:40.760
that I think has been really
honestly surprising for me.

00:43:40.760 --> 00:43:42.880
It's been really
healing, actually,

00:43:42.880 --> 00:43:45.790
just to tell it over
and over and to be--

00:43:45.790 --> 00:43:48.010
for me to be
reinforced by audiences

00:43:48.010 --> 00:43:52.210
that they're telling
me, like, you're enough.

00:43:52.210 --> 00:43:55.850
And to feel that over
and over again is so--

00:43:55.850 --> 00:43:58.897
I've been adding that
to me and the strength

00:43:58.897 --> 00:43:59.730
that I carry around.

00:43:59.730 --> 00:44:04.190
So honestly, I feel like every
time, I feel I'm in community,

00:44:04.190 --> 00:44:05.390
I feel strengthened.

00:44:05.390 --> 00:44:07.880
I was just at Pride in
New York, and that's just

00:44:07.880 --> 00:44:12.860
such a wonderful experience
to realize how much power

00:44:12.860 --> 00:44:15.160
is around you and behind
you, in front of you,

00:44:15.160 --> 00:44:17.150
and has gone before
you historically.

00:44:17.150 --> 00:44:23.690
So I personally like
to really tap into that

00:44:23.690 --> 00:44:28.270
and know that I am just part
of a river, and I'm in it.

00:44:28.270 --> 00:44:31.720
And my job is just to
keep grabbing what I can,

00:44:31.720 --> 00:44:35.380
passing it along where I need
to, channeling some messages

00:44:35.380 --> 00:44:38.170
that maybe I channel
in a certain way,

00:44:38.170 --> 00:44:39.670
and seen through
my lens, it's going

00:44:39.670 --> 00:44:42.190
to sound different to someone.

00:44:42.190 --> 00:44:43.735
But I got to keep
trying, and that's

00:44:43.735 --> 00:44:44.860
kind of what it feels like.

00:44:44.860 --> 00:44:46.160
But there's a real flow.

00:44:46.160 --> 00:44:48.600
There's a flow to it
once you get into it,

00:44:48.600 --> 00:44:51.879
but it's an
interesting question.

00:44:51.879 --> 00:44:53.920
NICOLE FARKOUH: So any--
we have one minute left.

00:44:53.920 --> 00:44:55.961
I want to make sure that
anyone who's in the room

00:44:55.961 --> 00:44:58.304
knows that you can
get a free book, one

00:44:58.304 --> 00:44:59.950
of Jennifer's free books.

00:44:59.950 --> 00:45:00.280
JENNIFER BROWN: Yes, yay.

00:45:00.280 --> 00:45:02.020
NICOLE FARKOUH: We don't
have them here with us today,

00:45:02.020 --> 00:45:03.566
but if you can write
your LDAP down,

00:45:03.566 --> 00:45:05.440
I will communicate with
you when they arrive,

00:45:05.440 --> 00:45:07.540
and we'll figure out
how to get it to you.

00:45:07.540 --> 00:45:10.835
So I'm going to make sure
that to ask you to sign on it

00:45:10.835 --> 00:45:11.681
before you go.

00:45:11.681 --> 00:45:13.180
AUDIENCE: We have
one more question.

00:45:13.180 --> 00:45:15.590
JENNIFER BROWN:
One more question.

00:45:15.590 --> 00:45:18.850
Yes, absolutely.

00:45:18.850 --> 00:45:20.140
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:45:20.140 --> 00:45:20.950
OK.

00:45:20.950 --> 00:45:24.580
My name is Marina, and I
lead a diversity initiative

00:45:24.580 --> 00:45:27.280
with my vendor team.

00:45:27.280 --> 00:45:29.620
And one of our main
difficulties right now

00:45:29.620 --> 00:45:31.900
is building a diverse pipeline.

00:45:31.900 --> 00:45:34.660
We don't have enough
resources to hire someone

00:45:34.660 --> 00:45:36.790
who could tell us what
to do or not to do,

00:45:36.790 --> 00:45:38.860
so right now I rely
a lot on materials

00:45:38.860 --> 00:45:41.290
that I find online and studies.

00:45:41.290 --> 00:45:43.480
And I wanted to know
if you can give me

00:45:43.480 --> 00:45:46.840
any tips for small
companies or teams

00:45:46.840 --> 00:45:48.610
that don't have a
lot of resources,

00:45:48.610 --> 00:45:52.175
how can we build a
more diverse team?

00:45:52.175 --> 00:45:54.550
NICOLE FARKOUH: The vendor
pipeline you're talking about?

00:45:54.550 --> 00:45:54.820
AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:45:54.820 --> 00:45:55.240
NICOLE FARKOUH: OK.

00:45:55.240 --> 00:45:56.440
JENNIFER BROWN: And the
hiring on the vendor

00:45:56.440 --> 00:45:57.727
side, like their own hiring?

00:45:57.727 --> 00:45:58.310
AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:45:58.310 --> 00:46:00.580
JENNIFER BROWN: Yeah.

00:46:00.580 --> 00:46:05.050
Yeah, it is difficult. You're
constrained geographically

00:46:05.050 --> 00:46:05.590
from--

00:46:05.590 --> 00:46:06.910
and what age are you hiring?

00:46:06.910 --> 00:46:10.090
Like, out of school or
more experienced hires,

00:46:10.090 --> 00:46:11.010
all of the above?

00:46:11.010 --> 00:46:11.550
AUDIENCE: Yeah,
all of the above.

00:46:11.550 --> 00:46:13.000
JENNIFER BROWN: All the above.

00:46:13.000 --> 00:46:14.980
Yeah, because the answer
is kind of different

00:46:14.980 --> 00:46:18.760
when you're looking at
young hiring out of schools.

00:46:18.760 --> 00:46:21.730
We always say, are you looking
at a broad array of schools?

00:46:21.730 --> 00:46:25.000
Are you looking at a-- are you
throwing the job description

00:46:25.000 --> 00:46:28.180
away and thinking more broadly
about the kinds of capabilities

00:46:28.180 --> 00:46:30.970
that you're looking for to
the nontraditional talent?

00:46:30.970 --> 00:46:33.340
And that means hiring
across difference usually.

00:46:33.340 --> 00:46:35.170
If your founder team
is largely maybe

00:46:35.170 --> 00:46:37.240
white and male or
Asian and male,

00:46:37.240 --> 00:46:40.820
it's going to mean that
they have to be committed

00:46:40.820 --> 00:46:43.870
and to I wouldn't say take a
risk, because I don't believe

00:46:43.870 --> 00:46:47.530
it's risky to hire
outside of your own image,

00:46:47.530 --> 00:46:49.310
but they will
believe that it is.

00:46:49.310 --> 00:46:53.170
And so how do we help them
understand that actually hiring

00:46:53.170 --> 00:46:56.680
in your own image can harm
your ability to be innovative

00:46:56.680 --> 00:46:59.470
and to generate that creative
abrasion that happens

00:46:59.470 --> 00:47:02.500
from that diversity of talent.

00:47:02.500 --> 00:47:05.450
And I think you've got to
start with that resistance may

00:47:05.450 --> 00:47:09.580
be there, to then kind of
taking some leaps of faith

00:47:09.580 --> 00:47:13.240
and looking under corners that
you wouldn't have normally.

00:47:13.240 --> 00:47:15.910
And even going so
far as to say I

00:47:15.910 --> 00:47:20.640
don't want to interview
if the pipeline has--

00:47:20.640 --> 00:47:23.170
I mean, I have a friend, Adam
Pisoni, who founded Yammer.

00:47:23.170 --> 00:47:24.920
I don't know if any
of you know who he is.

00:47:24.920 --> 00:47:25.900
He sold to Microsoft.

00:47:25.900 --> 00:47:28.270
His next startup, he
refuses to interview

00:47:28.270 --> 00:47:32.050
white, straight men like him.

00:47:32.050 --> 00:47:34.390
So literally they're not even
getting into the pipeline.

00:47:34.390 --> 00:47:35.390
He refuses.

00:47:35.390 --> 00:47:38.020
He said, if we let
any of that happen,

00:47:38.020 --> 00:47:40.390
it's going to end up that
our founding team, which

00:47:40.390 --> 00:47:43.280
is an education startup, by
the way, so serving schools,

00:47:43.280 --> 00:47:47.849
is going to be, again,
kind of largely male.

00:47:47.849 --> 00:47:49.390
And he's, like, I'm
not OK with that,

00:47:49.390 --> 00:47:53.260
and so I've got to take some
drastic action about even who

00:47:53.260 --> 00:47:57.130
I let into the pipeline to be
interviewed because there are

00:47:57.130 --> 00:47:58.910
so many male candidates
that come his way

00:47:58.910 --> 00:48:00.850
and not a lot of
diverse candidates.

00:48:00.850 --> 00:48:04.060
And so he's had to literally
kind of say to the team,

00:48:04.060 --> 00:48:07.720
this is a non-negotiable for
me, because this founding team

00:48:07.720 --> 00:48:09.730
is so important
because who you hire

00:48:09.730 --> 00:48:11.934
is then going to send a
signal to your next hires

00:48:11.934 --> 00:48:13.600
and your next hires
and your next hires.

00:48:13.600 --> 00:48:17.330
So literally what you do
when you're small really,

00:48:17.330 --> 00:48:20.045
really matters, because it
will make your job so much

00:48:20.045 --> 00:48:20.920
easier in the future.

00:48:20.920 --> 00:48:23.170
So you have to be
uncompromising.

00:48:23.170 --> 00:48:26.740
You might want to put
some metrics in place,

00:48:26.740 --> 00:48:29.380
and then think outside the box.

00:48:29.380 --> 00:48:33.070
Watch out also for gendered
language in job descriptions.

00:48:33.070 --> 00:48:35.590
Really interesting, there
are some fascinating startups

00:48:35.590 --> 00:48:36.520
that are going on.

00:48:36.520 --> 00:48:39.280
Unitive is one.

00:48:39.280 --> 00:48:42.922
Textio, Text.io is one, that
it literally goes through

00:48:42.922 --> 00:48:45.130
and looks at your job
descriptions and flags gendered

00:48:45.130 --> 00:48:46.760
language.

00:48:46.760 --> 00:48:49.900
And that keeps basically women
and nontraditional candidates

00:48:49.900 --> 00:48:51.720
away from even
applying for things.

00:48:51.720 --> 00:48:54.460
So the way that
we describe roles

00:48:54.460 --> 00:48:59.590
is gendered and begins that
process of bias that screens--

00:48:59.590 --> 00:49:03.010
people self-screen out because
if you're looking for a rock

00:49:03.010 --> 00:49:06.357
star coder, you're using
all this kind of language

00:49:06.357 --> 00:49:07.940
and women are like,
eh, that's not me.

00:49:07.940 --> 00:49:09.820
I just don't see myself in that.

00:49:09.820 --> 00:49:10.900
NICOLE FARKOUH: Especially
if you're an introvert.

00:49:10.900 --> 00:49:12.090
JENNIFER BROWN: Especially
if you're an introvert.

00:49:12.090 --> 00:49:12.640
Exactly.

00:49:12.640 --> 00:49:16.540
And my brilliant introvert--
so it really-- there's so many

00:49:16.540 --> 00:49:19.600
places bias occurs, I think,
that keeps your pipeline

00:49:19.600 --> 00:49:23.050
from being welcoming
to even think

00:49:23.050 --> 00:49:24.460
of themselves as applying.

00:49:24.460 --> 00:49:27.129
And so it's a long--
we can talk afterwards.

00:49:27.129 --> 00:49:28.170
There's a lot more ideas.

00:49:28.170 --> 00:49:30.820
And there's a lot of ideas
in here too of how to do it.

00:49:30.820 --> 00:49:31.370
NICOLE FARKOUH: Well,
with that, we're

00:49:31.370 --> 00:49:32.480
going to have to
end unfortunately.

00:49:32.480 --> 00:49:32.810
JENNIFER BROWN: Yes.

00:49:32.810 --> 00:49:33.650
NICOLE FARKOUH:
But thank you very

00:49:33.650 --> 00:49:34.430
much for the rich conversation.

00:49:34.430 --> 00:49:34.795
JENNIFER BROWN: Thank you, guys.

00:49:34.795 --> 00:49:35.320
Thank you for coming.

00:49:35.320 --> 00:49:35.570
[APPLAUSE]

00:49:35.570 --> 00:49:36.990
NICOLE FARKOUH: Thank you
all so much for coming.

00:49:36.990 --> 00:49:37.600
JENNIFER BROWN: So
good to see you all.

00:49:37.600 --> 00:49:39.150
NICOLE FARKOUH: And
looking forward--
