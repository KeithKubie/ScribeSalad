00:00:00.580 --> 00:00:03.140
I have another one of these
fill-in-the-blank triangle

00:00:03.140 --> 00:00:04.154
proof exercises.

00:00:04.154 --> 00:00:05.570
But this time,
instead of doing it

00:00:05.570 --> 00:00:08.004
on my own little
digital notebook,

00:00:08.004 --> 00:00:09.670
I'm going to do it
right on the exercise

00:00:09.670 --> 00:00:12.100
because there actually are
tools so you can mark up

00:00:12.100 --> 00:00:13.440
the diagrams.

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:20.110
So first they tell us that
segment BC is parallel to DF,

00:00:20.110 --> 00:00:22.587
figure not drawn to
scale, fair enough.

00:00:22.587 --> 00:00:24.920
And it's always important,
if we're going to do a proof,

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:26.336
to know what we're
going to prove.

00:00:26.336 --> 00:00:28.390
We're going to prove the
triangle EBD-- so that's

00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:33.292
this triangle down here-- is
congruent to triangle EBC.

00:00:33.292 --> 00:00:35.250
So this one right over
here, that this triangle

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:36.500
is congruent to that triangle.

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:38.330
That's what we're
going to try to prove.

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:40.384
So let's see what
givens they gave us.

00:00:40.384 --> 00:00:42.550
They say that-- and you see
when you scroll over it,

00:00:42.550 --> 00:00:44.133
they show you which
two angles they're

00:00:44.133 --> 00:00:47.280
talking about-- that
angle EBD, or BDE,

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:49.910
is congruent to angle ACB.

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:51.310
So let me mark those.

00:00:51.310 --> 00:00:54.280
So I just click once to show
that those two are congruent.

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:57.277
Then they say that these
two segments, DE and AC

00:00:57.277 --> 00:00:57.860
are congruent.

00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:58.735
So let me mark those.

00:00:58.735 --> 00:00:59.790
You just click on them.

00:00:59.790 --> 00:01:01.540
Click on them once it
does one slash mark.

00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:02.914
If you click on
it more than once

00:01:02.914 --> 00:01:04.910
it will do more
than one slash mark.

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:10.930
Then we also know that these
two are congruent, BED and BAC.

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:13.150
So I'm going to
put two arcs here

00:01:13.150 --> 00:01:15.090
to show that they
are not necessarily

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:16.950
congruent to these other two.

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:18.260
So I did those.

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:22.270
Now we have this one, BED--
which we've already marked,

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:26.340
that's BED right over
there-- is congruent to CEF.

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:28.350
So that's just telling
us that CEF, this angle,

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:29.349
is the same as this one.

00:01:29.349 --> 00:01:31.800
So I can put the double
hash marks there.

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:34.055
And then they tell us that
BE is congruent to EF.

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:42.490
And then finally, they
tell us that angle DBE

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:45.325
is congruent to CFE.

00:01:45.325 --> 00:01:46.670
I'll put three.

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:48.756
DBE is congruent to CFE.

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:55.820
So now let's try
to do our proof.

00:01:55.820 --> 00:01:58.210
And they've already kind of
done a scaffold of our proof.

00:01:58.210 --> 00:02:00.630
And we need to essentially
fill in the blanks.

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:02.831
So this first thing, they're
comparing two triangles

00:02:02.831 --> 00:02:04.330
and they say these
two triangles are

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:07.390
congruent because
of angle side angle.

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:10.259
So where can we even
make that statement?

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:13.310
Well we have this
triangle right over here.

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:15.330
We can say it's congruent
to this triangle

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:19.670
up here by angle side angle.

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:22.284
Or, we could say
that this triangle

00:02:22.284 --> 00:02:24.700
is congruent to this triangle,
because you have this angle

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:27.660
side angle, this
angle side angle.

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:30.880
So it's not clear, based
on just this blank,

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:32.750
which one they want
us to describe.

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:34.180
Let's go further
down in the proof

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:36.790
and maybe it'll
become more obvious.

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:39.150
Well then they have this
blank, right over here.

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:41.320
Blank equals blank because
corresponding parts

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:43.370
of congruent triangles
are congruent.

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:46.570
Once again, it's probably
based on which two triangles

00:02:46.570 --> 00:02:47.970
we picked to be congruent.

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:49.350
This is going to be one of them.

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:50.600
But we don't know
whether it's going

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:52.183
to be that one, or
that one, depending

00:02:52.183 --> 00:02:54.200
on how this proof is going down.

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:59.810
Then they say that triangle
ABC is congruent to EBD.

00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:01.520
So then they say
that this triangle

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:04.360
is congruent to this
triangle, right over here.

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:07.340
Well, if down here, they're
making that statement,

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:10.510
then up here they must want us
to say that this triangle is

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:12.900
congruent to this
triangle, right over here.

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:25.850
So we can say that EBD, the
double arc, double side,

00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:28.870
triple side is going to be
congruent to double arc,

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:35.650
double slashes, triple side,
so EFC, because of ASA.

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:36.410
There you go.

00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:38.710
And it filled it in which
is a good indication

00:03:38.710 --> 00:03:41.900
that we did it right.

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:43.270
Let's see, what else can we say?

00:03:43.270 --> 00:03:46.050
So now, remember, we're trying
to prove that this triangle

00:03:46.050 --> 00:03:49.160
right over here is
congruent to this triangle.

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:52.420
So based on this, we just said
that this triangle on the left

00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:54.930
is congruent to this
triangle on the right.

00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:58.380
Given that they're congruent,
what is useful information so

00:03:58.380 --> 00:04:01.290
that we can get information
about this middle triangle?

00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:05.640
Well this middle triangle
shares a side-- shares side EC,

00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:07.250
with this triangle over here.

00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:10.670
So we should say that side
EC is congruent to something

00:04:10.670 --> 00:04:13.340
over here, which
will help us set up

00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:15.470
that this middle
triangle is congruent.

00:04:15.470 --> 00:04:20.130
So based on the fact that
EBD and EFC are congruent,

00:04:20.130 --> 00:04:22.920
EC's corresponding
side would be what?

00:04:22.920 --> 00:04:26.050
Well, it's the side that's
opposite the triple angle.

00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:30.326
So it's going to
correspond to side DE.

00:04:30.326 --> 00:04:37.680
So we could say that
DE is congruent to EC

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:39.700
because they're
corresponding sides.

00:04:39.700 --> 00:04:42.050
They're both the sides
opposite this triple angle.

00:04:45.730 --> 00:04:49.830
Segment DE is congruent
to segment EC.

00:04:49.830 --> 00:04:52.550
There you go, and
that worked out.

00:04:52.550 --> 00:04:56.400
And then they say triangle ABC
and EBD-- so that's this one

00:04:56.400 --> 00:04:58.430
and this one-- are
congruent because--

00:04:58.430 --> 00:04:59.680
and we already went over this.

00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:00.740
There's multiple
ways that you could

00:05:00.740 --> 00:05:03.150
say that could-- well
actually, no, there's only one.

00:05:03.150 --> 00:05:07.090
They have this angle side angle.

00:05:07.090 --> 00:05:09.200
That's why they are congruent.

00:05:09.200 --> 00:05:12.720
So we have angle side
angle congruence.

00:05:12.720 --> 00:05:17.520
And then we can say that
BC is congruent to BD.

00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:20.135
Well those are corresponding
sides of congruent triangles.

00:05:20.135 --> 00:05:22.990
Those are both the sides
opposite the double arc.

00:05:22.990 --> 00:05:25.560
Opposite the double
arc, and then up here,

00:05:25.560 --> 00:05:26.950
opposite the double arc.

00:05:26.950 --> 00:05:30.910
So that's because they
are corresponding parts

00:05:30.910 --> 00:05:32.880
of congruent triangles.

00:05:32.880 --> 00:05:37.620
And then finally, so
let me mark those off.

00:05:37.620 --> 00:05:41.850
So that is congruent to
that, corresponding parts

00:05:41.850 --> 00:05:43.390
of congruent triangles.

00:05:43.390 --> 00:05:45.757
And then finally, we
can prove the statement.

00:05:45.757 --> 00:05:47.590
And actually you could
have probably guessed

00:05:47.590 --> 00:05:50.620
what this last one was because
this was the end of the proof,

00:05:50.620 --> 00:05:55.040
that EBD is congruent to EBC.

00:06:01.740 --> 00:06:04.420
And that's, once again, because
you have side side side.

00:06:04.420 --> 00:06:06.200
We've shown that
these three sides

00:06:06.200 --> 00:06:07.910
are congruent to
these three sides.

00:06:07.910 --> 00:06:09.277
It's congruent to EBC.

00:06:09.277 --> 00:06:11.360
And you want to make sure
you get the order right.

00:06:11.360 --> 00:06:16.850
So E is the angle opposite the
three sides on this triangle.

00:06:16.850 --> 00:06:19.810
And it's also the side opposite
the three sides on that one.

00:06:19.810 --> 00:06:22.960
And then, corresponding to B,
B is opposite the single side.

00:06:22.960 --> 00:06:25.170
And over here B is
opposite the single side.

00:06:25.170 --> 00:06:27.250
So it's going to be EBC.

00:06:27.250 --> 00:06:31.740
It's congruent to EBC
because of side side side.

00:06:31.740 --> 00:06:33.300
And let's check our answer.

00:06:33.300 --> 00:06:36.590
Drum roll, and it's right.

00:06:36.590 --> 00:06:38.390
Very good.
