00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:03.469
The subject for
this lesson is linear programming.

00:00:03.469 --> 00:00:07.050
We've seen some very general tools and
abstractions in this course.

00:00:07.050 --> 00:00:10.860
It would be hard to argue that any other
combines the virtues of simplicity,

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:14.090
generality and practicality as
well as linear programming.

00:00:15.100 --> 00:00:20.050
It's simple enough to be captured with a
few matrix expression and inequalities.

00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:23.080
General enough so that it can be
used to solve any problem in p and

00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:27.060
polynomial time, and practical
enough that it helped revolutionize

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:30.270
business and industry in
the middle of the 20th century.

00:00:30.270 --> 00:00:32.530
In many ways,
this is algorithms at its best.
