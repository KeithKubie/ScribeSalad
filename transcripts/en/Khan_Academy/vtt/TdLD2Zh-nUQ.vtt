00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:02.980
You hopefully have a little
intuition now on what a double

00:00:02.980 --> 00:00:06.920
integral is or how we go about
figuring out the volume

00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:07.490
under a surface.

00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:09.910
So let's actually compute it
and I think it'll all become

00:00:09.910 --> 00:00:10.910
a lot more concrete.

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:14.220
So let's say I have the
surface, z, and it's a

00:00:14.220 --> 00:00:15.530
function of x and y.

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:20.670
And it equals xy squared.

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:22.850
It's a surface in
three-dimensional space.

00:00:22.850 --> 00:00:26.020
And I want to know the
volume between this

00:00:26.020 --> 00:00:28.660
surface and the xy-plane.

00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:33.320
And the domain in the xy-plane
that I care about is x is

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:38.380
greater than or equal to 0,
and less than or equal to 2.

00:00:38.380 --> 00:00:42.450
And y is greater than or
equal to 0, and less

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:43.740
than or equal to 1.

00:00:43.740 --> 00:00:45.370
Let's see what that looks
like just so we have a

00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:47.960
good visualization of it.

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:50.260
So I graphed it here and
we can rotate it around.

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:52.750
This is z equals xy squared.

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:56.240
This is the bounding box,
right? x goes from 0 to

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:58.300
2; y goes from 0 to 1.

00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:00.720
We literally want this-- you
could almost view it the

00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:02.710
volume-- well, not almost.

00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:05.590
Exactly view it as the
volume under this surface.

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:08.530
Between this surface, the top
surface, and the xy-plane.

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:11.580
And I'll rotate it around so
you can get a little bit better

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:14.210
sense of the actual volume.

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:16.250
Let me rotate.

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:19.330
Now I should use the
mouse for this.

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:21.380
So it's this space,
underneath here.

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:23.975
It's like a makeshift
shelter or something.

00:01:23.975 --> 00:01:27.060
I could rotate it a little bit.

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:29.340
Whatever's under this,
between the two surfaces--

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:30.920
that's the volume.

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:32.550
Whoops, I've flipped it.

00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:33.500
There you go.

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:35.690
So that's the volume
that we care about.

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:38.490
Let's figure out how to do and
we'll try to gather a little

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:41.480
bit of the intuition
as we go along.

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:44.850
So I'm going to draw a not as
impressive version of that

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:49.026
graph, but I think it'll
do the job for now.

00:01:49.026 --> 00:01:50.185
Let me draw my axes.

00:01:52.710 --> 00:02:01.030
That's my x-axis, that's my
y-axis, and that's my z-axis.

00:02:04.552 --> 00:02:08.814
x, y, z.

00:02:08.814 --> 00:02:10.870
x is going from 0 to 2.

00:02:10.870 --> 00:02:12.300
Let's say that's 2.

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:16.160
y is going from 0 to 1.

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:20.796
So we're taking the volume
above this rectangle

00:02:20.796 --> 00:02:23.570
in the xy-plane.

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:25.740
And then the surface, I'm going
to try my best to draw it.

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:27.660
I'll draw it in a
different color.

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:30.680
I'm looking at the picture.

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:32.600
At this end it looks
something like this.

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:37.743
And then it has a
straight line.

00:02:37.743 --> 00:02:43.580
Let's see if I can draw this
surface going down like that.

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:47.176
And then if I was really
good I could shade it.

00:02:47.176 --> 00:02:50.695
It looks something like this.

00:02:50.695 --> 00:02:55.740
If I were to shade it,
the surface looks

00:02:55.740 --> 00:02:57.020
something like that.

00:02:57.020 --> 00:02:59.780
And this right here
is above this.

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:04.380
This is the bottom left corner,
you can almost view it.

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:08.700
So let me just say the yellow
is the top of the surface.

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:09.830
That's the top of the surface.

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:11.830
And then this is
under the surface.

00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:15.260
So we care about this
volume underneath here.

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:17.840
Let me show you the
actual surface.

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:20.280
So this volume underneath here.

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:21.060
I think you get the idea.

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:22.560
So how do we do that?

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:26.590
Well, in the last example we
said, well, let's pick an

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:29.920
arbitrary y and for that
y, let's figure out the

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:31.250
area under the curve.

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:36.280
So if we fix some y-- when you
actually do the problem, you

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:39.550
don't have to think about it in
this much detail, but I want

00:03:39.550 --> 00:03:40.410
to give you the intuition.

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:43.810
So if we pick just an
arbitrary y here.

00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:48.250
So on that y, we could think of
it-- if we have a fixed y, then

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:51.480
the function of x and y you can
almost view it as a function

00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:56.620
of just x for that given y.

00:03:56.620 --> 00:04:02.610
And so, we're kind of figuring
out the value of this, of

00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:04.470
the area under this curve.

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:11.820
You should view this as kind of
an up down curve for a given y.

00:04:11.820 --> 00:04:15.870
So if we know a y we can figure
out then-- for example, if y

00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:20.200
was 5, this function would
become z equals 25x.

00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:22.570
And then that's easy to
figure out the value

00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:23.350
of the curve under.

00:04:23.350 --> 00:04:26.070
So we'll make the value under
the curve as a function of y.

00:04:26.070 --> 00:04:27.500
We'll pretend like
it's just a constant.

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:28.770
So let's do that.

00:04:28.770 --> 00:04:33.680
So if we have a dx
that's our change in x.

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:36.710
And then our height of each of
our rectangles is going to be a

00:04:36.710 --> 00:04:40.010
function-- it's going to be z.

00:04:40.010 --> 00:04:42.660
The height is z, which is
a function of x and y.

00:04:42.660 --> 00:04:45.190
So we can take the integral.

00:04:45.190 --> 00:04:50.020
So the area of each of these is
going to be our function, xy

00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:54.760
squared-- I'll do it here
because I'll run out of space.

00:04:54.760 --> 00:04:59.015
xy squared times the
width, which is dx.

00:04:59.015 --> 00:05:05.710
And if we want the area of this
slice for a given y, we just

00:05:05.710 --> 00:05:08.030
integrate along the x-axis.

00:05:08.030 --> 00:05:10.095
We're going to integrate
from x is equal to 0

00:05:10.095 --> 00:05:12.230
to x is equal to 2.

00:05:12.230 --> 00:05:15.210
From x is equal to 0 to 2.

00:05:15.210 --> 00:05:16.790
Fair enough.

00:05:16.790 --> 00:05:21.050
Now, but we just don't want to
figure out the area under the

00:05:21.050 --> 00:05:23.600
curve at one slice, for one
particular y, we want to

00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:25.830
figure out the entire
area of the curve.

00:05:25.830 --> 00:05:27.570
So what we do is
we say, OK, fine.

00:05:27.570 --> 00:05:33.370
The area under the curve, not
the surface-- under this curve

00:05:33.370 --> 00:05:37.050
for a particular y,
is this expression.

00:05:37.050 --> 00:05:40.550
Well, what if I gave it
a little bit of depth?

00:05:40.550 --> 00:05:45.540
If I multiplied this area times
dy then it would give me a

00:05:45.540 --> 00:05:46.850
little bit of depth, right?

00:05:46.850 --> 00:05:50.140
We'd kind of have a
three-dimensional slice of the

00:05:50.140 --> 00:05:51.240
volume that we care about.

00:05:51.240 --> 00:05:52.870
I know it's hard to imagine.

00:05:52.870 --> 00:05:54.350
Let me bring that here.

00:05:54.350 --> 00:05:58.560
So if I had a slice here, we
just figured out the area of a

00:05:58.560 --> 00:06:01.400
slice and then I'm multiplying
it by dy to give it a

00:06:01.400 --> 00:06:04.200
little bit of depth.

00:06:04.200 --> 00:06:08.000
So you multiply it by dy to
give it a little bit of depth,

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:11.550
and then if we want the entire
volume under the curve we add

00:06:11.550 --> 00:06:14.070
all the dy's together, take the
infinite sum of these

00:06:14.070 --> 00:06:17.300
infinitely small
volumes really now.

00:06:17.300 --> 00:06:21.450
And so we will integrate
from y is equal to 0

00:06:21.450 --> 00:06:22.570
to y is equal to 1.

00:06:22.570 --> 00:06:24.290
I know this graph is a little
hard to understand, but you

00:06:24.290 --> 00:06:27.180
might want to re-watch
the first video.

00:06:27.180 --> 00:06:30.540
I had a slightly easier
to understand surface.

00:06:30.540 --> 00:06:33.590
So now, how do we
evaluate this?

00:06:33.590 --> 00:06:36.510
Well, like we said,
you evaluate from the

00:06:36.510 --> 00:06:37.500
inside and go outward.

00:06:40.480 --> 00:06:43.510
It's taking a partial
derivative in reverse.

00:06:43.510 --> 00:06:47.540
So we're integrating here with
respect to x, so we can treat

00:06:47.540 --> 00:06:49.420
y just like a constant.

00:06:49.420 --> 00:06:51.670
Like it's like the number
5 or something like that.

00:06:51.670 --> 00:06:53.620
So it really doesn't
change the integral.

00:06:53.620 --> 00:06:57.060
So what's the antiderivative
of xy squared?

00:06:57.060 --> 00:07:00.160
Well, the antiderivative of
xy squared-- I want to make

00:07:00.160 --> 00:07:02.280
sure I'm color consistent.

00:07:02.280 --> 00:07:05.720
Well, the antiderivative
of x is x to the 1/2--

00:07:05.720 --> 00:07:09.080
sorry. x squared over 2.

00:07:09.080 --> 00:07:12.180
And then y squared is
just a constant, right?

00:07:12.180 --> 00:07:14.580
And then we don't have to
worry about plus c since

00:07:14.580 --> 00:07:15.960
this is a definite integral.

00:07:15.960 --> 00:07:18.990
And we're going to
evaluate that at 2 and 0.

00:07:18.990 --> 00:07:21.190
And then we still have
the outside integral

00:07:21.190 --> 00:07:22.650
with respect to y.

00:07:22.650 --> 00:07:25.190
So once we figure that out
we're going to integrate it

00:07:25.190 --> 00:07:29.800
from 0 to 1 with respect to dy.

00:07:29.800 --> 00:07:31.470
Now what does this evaluate?

00:07:31.470 --> 00:07:32.912
We put a 2 in here.

00:07:32.912 --> 00:07:36.276
If you put a 2 in there
you get 2 squared over 2.

00:07:39.230 --> 00:07:41.740
That's just 4 over 2.

00:07:41.740 --> 00:07:43.565
So it's 2 y squared.

00:07:47.670 --> 00:07:51.210
Minus 0 squared over
2 times y squared.

00:07:51.210 --> 00:07:52.080
Well, that's just
going to be 0.

00:07:52.080 --> 00:07:52.950
So it's minus 0.

00:07:52.950 --> 00:07:55.220
I won't write that down because
hopefully that's a little

00:07:55.220 --> 00:07:56.190
bit of second nature to you.

00:07:56.190 --> 00:07:58.510
We just evaluated this
at the 2 endpoints and

00:07:58.510 --> 00:08:00.660
I'm short for space.

00:08:00.660 --> 00:08:03.710
So this evaluated at 2y
squared and now we evaluate

00:08:03.710 --> 00:08:05.580
the outside integral.

00:08:05.580 --> 00:08:08.910
0, 1 dy.

00:08:08.910 --> 00:08:10.230
And this is an important
thing to realize.

00:08:10.230 --> 00:08:13.120
When we evaluated this
inside integral, remember

00:08:13.120 --> 00:08:13.820
what we were doing?

00:08:13.820 --> 00:08:16.950
We were trying to figure out
for a given y, what the

00:08:16.950 --> 00:08:19.180
area of this surface was.

00:08:19.180 --> 00:08:23.070
Well, not this surface, the
area under the surface

00:08:23.070 --> 00:08:24.380
for a given y.

00:08:24.380 --> 00:08:27.190
For a given y that surface
kind of turns into a curve.

00:08:27.190 --> 00:08:30.110
And we tried to figure out
the area under that curve

00:08:30.110 --> 00:08:33.540
in the traditional sense.

00:08:33.540 --> 00:08:36.870
This ended up being
a function of y.

00:08:36.870 --> 00:08:40.500
And that makes sense because
depending on which y we pick

00:08:40.500 --> 00:08:44.390
we're going to get a
different area here.

00:08:44.390 --> 00:08:47.810
Obviously, depending on which y
we pick, the area-- kind of a

00:08:47.810 --> 00:08:52.620
wall dropped straight down--
that area's going to change.

00:08:52.620 --> 00:08:55.760
So we got a function of y when
we evaluated this and now we

00:08:55.760 --> 00:08:58.330
just integrate with respect to
y and this is just plain old

00:08:58.330 --> 00:09:00.810
vanilla definite integration.

00:09:00.810 --> 00:09:03.350
What's the antiderivative
of 2y squared?

00:09:03.350 --> 00:09:08.140
Well, that equals 2 times
y to the third over 3,

00:09:08.140 --> 00:09:11.510
or 2/3 y to the third.

00:09:11.510 --> 00:09:14.740
We're going to evaluate
that at 1 and 0, which

00:09:14.740 --> 00:09:16.100
is equal to-- let's see.

00:09:16.100 --> 00:09:17.480
1 to the third times 2/3.

00:09:17.480 --> 00:09:18.870
That's 2/3.

00:09:18.870 --> 00:09:20.460
Minus 0 to the third times 2/3.

00:09:20.460 --> 00:09:21.580
Well, that's just 0.

00:09:21.580 --> 00:09:25.270
So it equals 2/3.

00:09:25.270 --> 00:09:29.620
If our units were meters
these would be 2/3 meters

00:09:29.620 --> 00:09:31.230
cubed or cubic meters.

00:09:31.230 --> 00:09:32.280
But there you go.

00:09:32.280 --> 00:09:34.890
That's how you evaluate
a double integral.

00:09:34.890 --> 00:09:36.450
There really isn't
a new skill here.

00:09:36.450 --> 00:09:38.650
You just have to make sure to
keep track of the variables.

00:09:38.650 --> 00:09:39.760
Treat them constant.

00:09:39.760 --> 00:09:41.620
They need to be treated
constant, and then treat them

00:09:41.620 --> 00:09:44.710
as a variable of integration
when it's appropriate.

00:09:44.710 --> 00:09:49.090
Anyway, I will see you
in the next video.
