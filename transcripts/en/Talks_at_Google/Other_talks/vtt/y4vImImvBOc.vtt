00:00:00.992 --> 00:00:04.500
CAT ALLMAN: Good morning,
everybody, or good afternoon.

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:05.790
My name's Cat Allman.

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:07.510
I'm with Google's Open
Source Programs

00:00:07.510 --> 00:00:09.880
Office here at Google.

00:00:09.880 --> 00:00:14.190
We're happy to have with
us today Paul F. Levy.

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:16.620
Paul is a manager.

00:00:16.620 --> 00:00:19.520
You might be thinking, I'm
sitting in a room, about to

00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:21.830
listen to a manager.

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:26.270
But you would be wrong Paul
is a manager the way a

00:00:26.270 --> 00:00:28.420
Stradivarius is a fiddle.

00:00:28.420 --> 00:00:30.560
PAUL LEVY: Oh.

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:31.690
CAT ALLMAN: And he's
modest, too.

00:00:31.690 --> 00:00:33.110
You can tell.

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:35.920
Under his leadership at the
Massachusetts Water Resources

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:38.370
Authority, Boston Harbor, which
had been dubbed the

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:41.965
dirtiest harbor in America,
was cleaned up.

00:00:41.965 --> 00:00:45.540
He then became chair and
president of Beth Israel

00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:48.000
Deaconess Medical Center
in Boston.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.940
This is the teaching hospital
for Harvard University and is

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:53.680
consistently ranked as one of
the best hospitals in the

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:55.300
United States.

00:00:55.300 --> 00:01:00.280
It was here in 2009 that he, in
the face of the recession,

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:03.260
worked with his employees to
crowd-source cost-savings

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:07.100
solutions which saved hundreds
of jobs, in particular for his

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:09.350
lowest-paid employees.

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:12.530
Here and there, he has squeezed
in serving as

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:15.170
chairman of the Massachusetts
Department of Public

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:18.500
Utilities, Executive Dean of
Administration for Harvard

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:19.970
Medical School.

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:25.160
He is a member of The MIT
Corporation and the board of

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:31.060
ISO New England, and he's a
20-plus-year soccer coach for

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:33.910
youths in the Massachusetts
area.

00:01:33.910 --> 00:01:37.140
This man has successfully faced
down academics, hospital

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:41.580
administrators, and roving gangs
of 12-year-old girls.

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:44.620
Paul is here today to talk to us
about his book "Goal Play!

00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:47.140
Lessons From the Soccer
Field." Please

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:49.538
welcome Paul Levy.

00:01:49.538 --> 00:01:50.006
PAUL LEVY: Thank you.

00:01:50.006 --> 00:01:53.950
[APPLAUSE]

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:57.710
Thank you, Cat, it's really
a pleasure to be here.

00:01:57.710 --> 00:01:59.470
I want to explain a little
bit about this

00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:04.010
book and how it occurred.

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:06.960
As Cat mentioned, for over 20
years, I've been coaching

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:11.690
girls' soccer in my hometown,
in Newton, Massachusetts.

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:15.170
And during that time, I've also
had the privilege and the

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:18.510
luck to run a number of complex
organizations--

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:22.500
Beth Israel Deaconess Medical
Center, Mass Water Resources

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:24.840
Authority, and so on.

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:27.460
And what I discovered over the
20-something years of coaching

00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:29.510
girls' soccer is that if you
can coach an 11-year-old

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:32.750
girls' soccer team, you can run
an academic medical center

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:34.330
or any other corporation.

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:37.810
Now I'm not sure that says
something about the emotional

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:43.720
energy, the emotional age of
doctors and other people with

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:45.290
whom you work in a hospital--

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:45.980
it might--

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:48.720
but I think it says something
more about the nature of human

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:52.740
beings, wherever they work
and whatever they do.

00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:57.100
So I wrote this book, and the
book, as you'll see, consists

00:02:57.100 --> 00:03:00.320
of a number of chapters, each
of which starts with an

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:03.900
anecdote about coaching girls'
soccer or refereeing soccer.

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:06.840
And from that, I dive into some
fairly serious lessons

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:09.720
about leadership.

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:13.170
Now I want to start by saying
that a lot of people think

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:16.590
about leadership in terms of the
CEO of an organization or

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:20.030
the president or vice president
or whatever.

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:22.600
And certainly those are
leadership positions.

00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:24.510
But I think it's more important
to understand that

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:28.430
we are all in leadership
positions at some point in our

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:33.030
lives, whether at work or in
our community activities.

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:36.120
It might just be leading a
task force or a community

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:37.370
group or whatever.

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:42.880
It might be coaching a
girls' soccer team.

00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:45.870
And so I would ask you to
think broadly about the

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:49.440
attributes that are useful to
people when you're in charge,

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:51.320
when you're the leader.

00:03:51.320 --> 00:03:52.960
And I would distinguish
a little with Cat, the

00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:55.790
difference between leadership
and manager.

00:03:55.790 --> 00:03:57.860
A manager is someone
who manages.

00:03:57.860 --> 00:04:01.610
A leader is someone who goes a
little further than that and

00:04:01.610 --> 00:04:04.580
acts in a way that actually
inspires the organization or

00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:07.130
the group of people with
whom you're working.

00:04:07.130 --> 00:04:08.450
So you're all leaders.

00:04:08.450 --> 00:04:10.860
You're all above
average, right?

00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:12.260
Anybody here not above average?

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:12.470
Good.

00:04:12.470 --> 00:04:14.810
This is Lake Wobegon.

00:04:14.810 --> 00:04:19.070
I used to make a joke about my
hospital, that all the babies

00:04:19.070 --> 00:04:21.055
born in our hospital
were above average,

00:04:21.055 --> 00:04:24.310
at Beth Israel Hospital.

00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:27.900
And it was true, because it
was a proposition I tested

00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:31.540
scientifically by interviewing
grandparents.

00:04:31.540 --> 00:04:32.440
Yeah.

00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:34.990
And in all the years I worked
at the hospital, never once

00:04:34.990 --> 00:04:38.120
did a grandparent say, when I
said, how's the new baby,

00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:40.570
never once did they say, well,
kind of substandard.

00:04:40.570 --> 00:04:41.420
It was always--

00:04:41.420 --> 00:04:44.180
spectacular, so intelligent,
math skills, everything.

00:04:44.180 --> 00:04:45.490
This was on day two.

00:04:45.490 --> 00:04:50.320
And so like that, here,
you have a group

00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:51.130
that's above average.

00:04:51.130 --> 00:04:52.690
And in fact, you are.

00:04:52.690 --> 00:04:54.120
I mean, we have to
acknowledge that.

00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:57.680
This is a great place to work
and full of great people.

00:04:57.680 --> 00:05:02.120
But like any organization, any
complex organization--

00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:04.320
which I define as any
organization having more than

00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:05.730
three people--

00:05:05.730 --> 00:05:09.160
things get in the way of getting
the job done, even

00:05:09.160 --> 00:05:09.780
though we're very

00:05:09.780 --> 00:05:12.800
well-intentioned and above average.

00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:15.160
So let me just dive into some
stories from the book, and

00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:17.760
then we'll see where
they take us.

00:05:17.760 --> 00:05:20.210
Any soccer players
here, by the way?

00:05:20.210 --> 00:05:21.320
OK, good.

00:05:21.320 --> 00:05:24.362
What's the most important
skill in playing soccer?

00:05:24.362 --> 00:05:26.670
AUDIENCE: Vision.

00:05:26.670 --> 00:05:27.920
PAUL LEVY: Vision?

00:05:29.410 --> 00:05:30.810
Nothing?

00:05:30.810 --> 00:05:31.770
AUDIENCE: Teamwork.

00:05:31.770 --> 00:05:33.210
Teamwork.

00:05:33.210 --> 00:05:33.780
PAUL LEVY: Teamwork.

00:05:33.780 --> 00:05:36.640
Well, that's a thought--
almost.

00:05:36.640 --> 00:05:39.710
The most important skill is
actually controlling the ball

00:05:39.710 --> 00:05:41.850
when it gets to you.

00:05:41.850 --> 00:05:43.180
Now why is that?

00:05:43.180 --> 00:05:43.790
OK.

00:05:43.790 --> 00:05:45.340
For those of you who
don't play soccer--

00:05:45.340 --> 00:05:47.760
or football as we call
it in Mexico or

00:05:47.760 --> 00:05:50.580
elsewhere in the world--

00:05:50.580 --> 00:05:52.590
this is a really simple game.

00:05:52.590 --> 00:05:56.080
There are two teams playing
on the same field.

00:05:56.080 --> 00:05:57.410
It's a rectangle.

00:05:57.410 --> 00:06:00.270
And at either end of the
rectangle there are goals, and

00:06:00.270 --> 00:06:04.480
the object of the game is to
get the ball into the other

00:06:04.480 --> 00:06:07.490
team's goal more often than
they get it into yours.

00:06:07.490 --> 00:06:10.110
The rest, as Hillel once
said, is commentary.

00:06:10.110 --> 00:06:11.130
Right?

00:06:11.130 --> 00:06:12.780
That's the whole deal.

00:06:12.780 --> 00:06:14.560
Now what makes it difficult?

00:06:14.560 --> 00:06:18.280
And what actually makes it
similar to working for a

00:06:18.280 --> 00:06:22.170
corporation or another
institution, is you don't know

00:06:22.170 --> 00:06:24.990
what the other people
are planning to do

00:06:24.990 --> 00:06:27.140
before the game starts.

00:06:27.140 --> 00:06:29.360
You don't even know what they're
planning to do as the

00:06:29.360 --> 00:06:32.240
game is going along, because
they're constantly changing

00:06:32.240 --> 00:06:35.280
their strategy and their tactics
and their position

00:06:35.280 --> 00:06:36.960
around the field.

00:06:36.960 --> 00:06:39.180
You don't even know what the
field is going to be like

00:06:39.180 --> 00:06:41.000
before the game starts.

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:41.740
Is it muddy?

00:06:41.740 --> 00:06:43.040
Is it rutted?

00:06:43.040 --> 00:06:44.580
Are there tufts of grass
that are going to

00:06:44.580 --> 00:06:46.195
knock the ball awry?

00:06:46.195 --> 00:06:48.270
You don't know what the wind is
going to be like during the

00:06:48.270 --> 00:06:50.410
course of the game, where the
sun's going to be, whether the

00:06:50.410 --> 00:06:51.790
clouds are going
to be covering.

00:06:51.790 --> 00:06:54.390
Whether a dog's going to run
across the field in the middle

00:06:54.390 --> 00:06:55.060
of the game.

00:06:55.060 --> 00:06:56.790
You don't know what the fans
are going to be like.

00:06:56.790 --> 00:06:59.280
You don't even know what the
referees are going to be like.

00:06:59.280 --> 00:07:02.540
So this is a challenging
situation for your 11 players

00:07:02.540 --> 00:07:03.590
on the field--

00:07:03.590 --> 00:07:06.270
a constantly changing
situation.

00:07:06.270 --> 00:07:10.180
You don't even know how your own
team is going to perform

00:07:10.180 --> 00:07:11.690
as the game starts.

00:07:11.690 --> 00:07:13.590
Think of the analogy
to an organization.

00:07:13.590 --> 00:07:14.560
You're a corporation.

00:07:14.560 --> 00:07:15.810
You're doing really interesting

00:07:15.810 --> 00:07:16.980
things for the world.

00:07:16.980 --> 00:07:18.810
I don't know if you've noticed
it lately, but there are

00:07:18.810 --> 00:07:22.990
people who want to compete with
you, who have strategies,

00:07:22.990 --> 00:07:26.610
whose whole job in life is to
figure out how to weaken you

00:07:26.610 --> 00:07:29.595
so they can get better,
so they can score more

00:07:29.595 --> 00:07:32.530
goals than you score.

00:07:32.530 --> 00:07:34.270
There are things going
on internally to your

00:07:34.270 --> 00:07:36.490
organization as well.

00:07:36.490 --> 00:07:38.780
Was somebody sick yesterday who
was going to make a major

00:07:38.780 --> 00:07:39.890
presentation today?

00:07:39.890 --> 00:07:42.310
How do you adjust to that?

00:07:42.310 --> 00:07:45.290
Does somebody in a higher-up
position here all of a sudden

00:07:45.290 --> 00:07:48.700
decide, new strategy--
we're going that way.

00:07:48.700 --> 00:07:50.240
How do we react to that?

00:07:50.240 --> 00:07:52.540
So a soccer game is a wonderful
metaphor for

00:07:52.540 --> 00:07:55.180
corporate life, because you
have both exogenous and

00:07:55.180 --> 00:07:57.690
endogenous changes occurring
all the time.

00:07:57.690 --> 00:07:58.670
And how do you adjust?

00:07:58.670 --> 00:08:03.520
Well, you adjust by creating a
team that's a self-learning

00:08:03.520 --> 00:08:07.930
organization, that can learn
in real time to make the

00:08:07.930 --> 00:08:10.220
changes necessary to succeed.

00:08:10.220 --> 00:08:11.160
How do you do that?

00:08:11.160 --> 00:08:12.950
Well, you're the coach.

00:08:12.950 --> 00:08:16.070
You're the leader of the whole
thing-- of a group, task

00:08:16.070 --> 00:08:18.100
force, whatever.

00:08:18.100 --> 00:08:20.840
You can't do the job.

00:08:20.840 --> 00:08:23.570
As a coach, you're
on the sidelines.

00:08:23.570 --> 00:08:26.520
You're advising, you're
inspiring, perhaps.

00:08:26.520 --> 00:08:28.110
But the players on the
team are making the

00:08:28.110 --> 00:08:30.810
decisions in real time.

00:08:30.810 --> 00:08:32.490
So what do you need to
know, as a coach?

00:08:32.490 --> 00:08:34.570
OK, back to our little girls.

00:08:34.570 --> 00:08:36.130
Most important thing.

00:08:36.130 --> 00:08:38.030
I'm talking to the 11-year-olds
one day.

00:08:38.030 --> 00:08:39.230
These are cute little girls.

00:08:39.230 --> 00:08:40.400
They're adorable.

00:08:40.400 --> 00:08:41.260
They're 11.

00:08:41.260 --> 00:08:42.260
They're feeling their oats.

00:08:42.260 --> 00:08:44.450
They want to be good
at what they do.

00:08:44.450 --> 00:08:46.250
They love playing soccer.

00:08:46.250 --> 00:08:48.260
They're out there, they love
being with their friends, they

00:08:48.260 --> 00:08:50.175
love to run around and scream.

00:08:50.175 --> 00:08:53.850
I'm the coach, I'm the adult,
supposedly, on the field.

00:08:53.850 --> 00:08:56.130
And I say to them, girls, you
know the most important thing

00:08:56.130 --> 00:08:59.640
in this game is controlling
the ball as it gets to us.

00:08:59.640 --> 00:09:01.835
Because if we don't control
it, if it bounces off our

00:09:01.835 --> 00:09:03.040
foot, guess what?

00:09:03.040 --> 00:09:04.720
The other team's going
to get it.

00:09:04.720 --> 00:09:05.650
That's not good.

00:09:05.650 --> 00:09:08.430
We want to control the ball,
so we can decide whether to

00:09:08.430 --> 00:09:12.410
pass it, shoot it, dribble,
or whatever.

00:09:12.410 --> 00:09:13.410
And they're nodding.

00:09:13.410 --> 00:09:15.570
And then I say, but you know
what the most important thing

00:09:15.570 --> 00:09:17.610
is about controlling the ball?

00:09:17.610 --> 00:09:21.540
It's to think about what you're
going to do with it as

00:09:21.540 --> 00:09:23.130
it approaches you.

00:09:23.130 --> 00:09:25.560
Because you, as adults,
understand that if we wait

00:09:25.560 --> 00:09:28.970
until the ball's at my foot,
neurologically I can't send a

00:09:28.970 --> 00:09:32.020
signal from my brain fast enough
to deal with what that

00:09:32.020 --> 00:09:33.010
ball is doing.

00:09:33.010 --> 00:09:35.720
I have to think about
it as it approaches.

00:09:35.720 --> 00:09:37.790
I don't suppose any of you
watched the baseball game last

00:09:37.790 --> 00:09:40.910
night, but if you notice,
baseball batters, as the pitch

00:09:40.910 --> 00:09:43.400
approaches, they actually start
swinging way before the

00:09:43.400 --> 00:09:44.230
ball gets to them.

00:09:44.230 --> 00:09:48.310
If they wait till it gets to
them, it doesn't work--

00:09:48.310 --> 00:09:51.520
except for your pitcher, who
managed to slap one into left

00:09:51.520 --> 00:09:54.670
field just at the
right moment.

00:09:54.670 --> 00:09:57.620
So I'm saying to the girls, so I
want you to think about what

00:09:57.620 --> 00:10:01.250
you're going to do with the ball
before it gets to you.

00:10:01.250 --> 00:10:02.156
OK?

00:10:02.156 --> 00:10:03.770
OK, Coach, we got it.

00:10:03.770 --> 00:10:04.630
I say, let's try it out.

00:10:04.630 --> 00:10:07.110
I throw a bunch of balls
out on the field.

00:10:07.110 --> 00:10:10.380
A ball comes rolling towards
Margaret, and without thinking

00:10:10.380 --> 00:10:14.490
about it, bam, she kicks
it into the woods.

00:10:14.490 --> 00:10:16.130
Not even on the field
anywhere.

00:10:16.130 --> 00:10:17.470
Into the woods.

00:10:17.470 --> 00:10:19.740
And I say Margaret, you weren't
thinking about what

00:10:19.740 --> 00:10:21.920
you were going to do with the
ball before it got to you.

00:10:21.920 --> 00:10:22.620
Oh, no, Coach.

00:10:22.620 --> 00:10:23.870
I was thinking about it.

00:10:23.870 --> 00:10:26.165
I just hadn't reached a
conclusion, she says.

00:10:26.165 --> 00:10:27.772
[LAUGHTER]

00:10:27.772 --> 00:10:31.980
OK, so what's the
problem here?

00:10:31.980 --> 00:10:35.820
The problem here-- there was a
famous UCLA basketball coach

00:10:35.820 --> 00:10:38.240
named John Wooden-- anybody
remember John Wooden, the best

00:10:38.240 --> 00:10:39.680
coach in the world?--

00:10:39.680 --> 00:10:42.600
who used to say, you haven't
taught it if they haven't

00:10:42.600 --> 00:10:44.540
learned it.

00:10:44.540 --> 00:10:46.370
You haven't taught it if they
haven't learned it.

00:10:46.370 --> 00:10:47.690
What did he mean by that?

00:10:47.690 --> 00:10:52.770
Well, what he meant by that is
that students, staff, are a

00:10:52.770 --> 00:10:54.950
terrific substrate
for learning.

00:10:54.950 --> 00:10:57.570
These are people who
want to do well.

00:10:57.570 --> 00:10:58.970
They want to do good
for the world.

00:10:58.970 --> 00:11:03.120
People here want to do
good for the world.

00:11:03.120 --> 00:11:07.490
You can trust them to want to
do well and want to do good.

00:11:07.490 --> 00:11:10.700
Your job as coach or teacher
is to help them learn what

00:11:10.700 --> 00:11:13.190
they need to to become a
learning organization or

00:11:13.190 --> 00:11:15.180
substantively whatever
they need.

00:11:15.180 --> 00:11:17.780
And if they haven't learned it
and they're well-intentioned

00:11:17.780 --> 00:11:19.920
thoughtful people, it means
you haven't taught

00:11:19.920 --> 00:11:21.280
it the right way.

00:11:21.280 --> 00:11:23.970
It's not their fault for
not having learned it.

00:11:23.970 --> 00:11:26.530
It's your fault as the coach.

00:11:26.530 --> 00:11:28.470
So what was my problem?

00:11:28.470 --> 00:11:30.210
What did I do wrong with
this group of girls?

00:11:30.210 --> 00:11:30.850
What do you think?

00:11:30.850 --> 00:11:34.314
What I do wrong?

00:11:34.314 --> 00:11:37.278
AUDIENCE: You asked them to
think rather than decide.

00:11:37.278 --> 00:11:40.250
You asked them to think
and not decide.

00:11:40.250 --> 00:11:43.140
PAUL LEVY: I asked them to
think, and not decide.

00:11:43.140 --> 00:11:46.180
But how did I instruct them?

00:11:46.180 --> 00:11:49.050
I gave them a lecture.

00:11:49.050 --> 00:11:54.120
I engaged in didactic training
of 11-year-olds.

00:11:54.120 --> 00:11:55.990
Think about this.

00:11:55.990 --> 00:11:57.250
Anyone have 11-year-olds?

00:11:57.250 --> 00:11:58.980
Anyone remember being 11?

00:11:58.980 --> 00:12:02.990
Did you ever listen to a
lecture from a teacher?

00:12:02.990 --> 00:12:05.290
And here I am, trying to
teach a kinesthetic

00:12:05.290 --> 00:12:09.570
skill by giving a lecture.

00:12:09.570 --> 00:12:11.920
Anyone take dance
lessons, ever?

00:12:11.920 --> 00:12:12.580
Yeah.

00:12:12.580 --> 00:12:14.520
You don't learn by a lecture,
right, Cat?

00:12:14.520 --> 00:12:15.990
It doesn't work.

00:12:15.990 --> 00:12:18.340
You actually have
to do the thing.

00:12:18.340 --> 00:12:20.910
So what approach could I have
taken with these girls?

00:12:20.910 --> 00:12:22.300
I could have said to
them, I could have

00:12:22.300 --> 00:12:23.370
just posed the question.

00:12:23.370 --> 00:12:26.550
I could have engaged in
a Socratic approach.

00:12:26.550 --> 00:12:28.960
I could have said, hey, kids,
what do you think about when

00:12:28.960 --> 00:12:31.290
the ball is rolling
towards you?

00:12:31.290 --> 00:12:34.130
One of them probably would have
said, I'm thinking about

00:12:34.130 --> 00:12:36.550
what I'm going to do with the
ball when it gets to me.

00:12:36.550 --> 00:12:38.800
And then I could've said,
gee, does that

00:12:38.800 --> 00:12:40.520
sound like a good idea?

00:12:40.520 --> 00:12:42.110
And the others would have
said, Yeah, that's--

00:12:42.110 --> 00:12:43.000
why?

00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:44.860
And someone would have said,
because if you wait till it

00:12:44.860 --> 00:12:46.500
gets to you, you muff it up.

00:12:46.500 --> 00:12:48.250
It doesn't work well.

00:12:48.250 --> 00:12:49.260
Oh, I'd say.

00:12:49.260 --> 00:12:51.680
And then I could say to them,
gee, that feels like an

00:12:51.680 --> 00:12:54.500
important thing for us
all to learn to do.

00:12:54.500 --> 00:12:58.850
What kind of games or exercises
could you invent to

00:12:58.850 --> 00:13:00.590
help learn how to do this?

00:13:00.590 --> 00:13:03.870
And then they would have
invented the games.

00:13:03.870 --> 00:13:06.580
And then we'd play the game for
a while, and I'd say, how

00:13:06.580 --> 00:13:09.140
do we know if this is
working or not?

00:13:09.140 --> 00:13:11.400
And then they would have
invented the metric of

00:13:11.400 --> 00:13:15.070
success, and they would've
judged their own performance

00:13:15.070 --> 00:13:17.910
against the metric
they invented.

00:13:17.910 --> 00:13:21.120
They would have held themselves
accountable to the

00:13:21.120 --> 00:13:25.000
standard of performance
that they invented.

00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:26.166
Whoa.

00:13:26.166 --> 00:13:28.170
What would I have
done as a coach?

00:13:28.170 --> 00:13:31.260
I just would have asked
dumb questions.

00:13:31.260 --> 00:13:32.790
What could we do?

00:13:32.790 --> 00:13:33.950
Why would that work?

00:13:33.950 --> 00:13:36.060
What else could we do?

00:13:36.060 --> 00:13:37.660
All right.

00:13:37.660 --> 00:13:40.330
So let's think about it from a
leadership perspective, more

00:13:40.330 --> 00:13:41.940
broadly, now.

00:13:41.940 --> 00:13:44.290
Your job as coach is to teach.

00:13:44.290 --> 00:13:46.080
You're teaching lots of
different things in an

00:13:46.080 --> 00:13:49.320
organization or on
a sporting team.

00:13:49.320 --> 00:13:50.910
Your job is to teach.

00:13:50.910 --> 00:13:54.650
To teach well, you have to have
some theory of learning.

00:13:54.650 --> 00:13:57.490
If you don't have a theory of
how people learn, how do you

00:13:57.490 --> 00:14:00.700
design your curriculum
or your pedagogy?

00:14:00.700 --> 00:14:02.650
There's a theory of learning
that I've been using over the

00:14:02.650 --> 00:14:04.580
years, that I borrowed from
someone at MIT, a

00:14:04.580 --> 00:14:06.430
professor at MIT--

00:14:06.430 --> 00:14:08.850
and she actually does machine
learning, which is really

00:14:08.850 --> 00:14:09.960
interesting.

00:14:09.960 --> 00:14:12.390
Nonetheless, she has this
concept of learning.

00:14:12.390 --> 00:14:14.510
Stage one of learning.

00:14:14.510 --> 00:14:16.200
The squeaking in the background,
by the way, is my

00:14:16.200 --> 00:14:18.230
grandson, Liam.

00:14:18.230 --> 00:14:19.480
He likes to sing.

00:14:23.650 --> 00:14:24.530
Theory of learning.

00:14:24.530 --> 00:14:28.820
Step one of learning
is interest.

00:14:28.820 --> 00:14:30.800
This is obvious.

00:14:30.800 --> 00:14:32.940
I decide I want to learn a
new musical instrument.

00:14:32.940 --> 00:14:33.430
Why?

00:14:33.430 --> 00:14:35.030
I'm interested in it.

00:14:35.030 --> 00:14:37.170
I decide I want to learn a
different kind of computer

00:14:37.170 --> 00:14:37.680
programming.

00:14:37.680 --> 00:14:40.290
Some of you maybe do
that stuff here.

00:14:40.290 --> 00:14:41.650
I'm interested in it.

00:14:41.650 --> 00:14:42.140
Good.

00:14:42.140 --> 00:14:44.120
Next phase after interest--

00:14:44.120 --> 00:14:45.800
distress.

00:14:45.800 --> 00:14:46.780
Distress.

00:14:46.780 --> 00:14:48.170
What's distress about?

00:14:48.170 --> 00:14:50.820
Distress is about the fact
that we are creatures of

00:14:50.820 --> 00:14:52.990
habit, we human beings.

00:14:52.990 --> 00:14:55.850
There's probably some
evolutionary reason for that.

00:14:55.850 --> 00:14:56.790
I don't know.

00:14:56.790 --> 00:14:59.210
Probably because the first time
we saw a saber-toothed

00:14:59.210 --> 00:15:02.200
tiger, we wanted to remember
it for the next time

00:15:02.200 --> 00:15:03.960
and the next time.

00:15:03.960 --> 00:15:07.980
But habit gets in our way when
we're trying to learn

00:15:07.980 --> 00:15:09.760
something new.

00:15:09.760 --> 00:15:10.840
Why?

00:15:10.840 --> 00:15:12.560
Because when you learn something
new, you have to

00:15:12.560 --> 00:15:15.990
establish a new framework for
whatever it is you're trying

00:15:15.990 --> 00:15:19.530
to learn, whether it's a
physical skill or an emotional

00:15:19.530 --> 00:15:22.920
skill or an intellectual
skills.

00:15:22.920 --> 00:15:26.170
Getting through that
phase is hard.

00:15:26.170 --> 00:15:28.510
How many of you have ever felt
you've been learning something

00:15:28.510 --> 00:15:29.855
new, and you hit a plateau?

00:15:29.855 --> 00:15:30.770
Right?

00:15:30.770 --> 00:15:32.510
Everybody feels that way.

00:15:32.510 --> 00:15:34.340
What's the plateau about?

00:15:34.340 --> 00:15:38.000
We're getting in our way of
learning the new thing.

00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:39.990
I had a wonderful
math professor--

00:15:39.990 --> 00:15:42.840
I was an undergraduate at MIT.

00:15:42.840 --> 00:15:44.926
In those days, anybody
could get into MIT.

00:15:48.490 --> 00:15:50.730
His name was Gian-Carlo Rota.

00:15:50.730 --> 00:15:58.110
Wonderful Italian professor,
talking like

00:15:58.110 --> 00:15:59.360
this all the time.

00:15:59.360 --> 00:16:01.175
A lot of gestures, and so on.

00:16:01.175 --> 00:16:02.990
By the way, what do they call
it when an Italian has a

00:16:02.990 --> 00:16:04.460
broken arm?

00:16:04.460 --> 00:16:07.010
A speech impediment.

00:16:07.010 --> 00:16:08.690
So Gianco was that
kind of guy.

00:16:08.690 --> 00:16:09.510
And he was wonderful.

00:16:09.510 --> 00:16:12.760
He was a warm, kind man, and
a great teacher, and very

00:16:12.760 --> 00:16:13.800
flamboyant.

00:16:13.800 --> 00:16:17.550
And one day, he has 400 of us
in an auditorium, 400 MIT

00:16:17.550 --> 00:16:20.560
freshmen in an auditorium, and
he's teaching us a new

00:16:20.560 --> 00:16:23.270
theorem, and we're
not getting it.

00:16:23.270 --> 00:16:25.610
He can see we're not getting
it, because he's looking at

00:16:25.610 --> 00:16:27.160
our blank faces.

00:16:27.160 --> 00:16:28.340
And so what does he do?

00:16:28.340 --> 00:16:28.980
He tries again.

00:16:28.980 --> 00:16:31.080
He comes around to the problem
a different way, tries a

00:16:31.080 --> 00:16:32.130
different approach.

00:16:32.130 --> 00:16:33.140
We're not getting it.

00:16:33.140 --> 00:16:37.430
At this point, the rather
emotional Gianco gets upset,

00:16:37.430 --> 00:16:39.980
angry, and he takes his chalk,
and he throws it on the

00:16:39.980 --> 00:16:42.880
ground, and he says, look,
learning is overcoming your

00:16:42.880 --> 00:16:44.780
prejudices.

00:16:44.780 --> 00:16:48.140
Learning is overcoming your
prejudices, he says to us.

00:16:48.140 --> 00:16:50.090
And we'll all go, doing!

00:16:50.090 --> 00:16:51.160
Like this.

00:16:51.160 --> 00:16:53.470
And we say, oh, yeah.

00:16:53.470 --> 00:16:57.280
And we learned the theorem,
because he shocked us through.

00:16:57.280 --> 00:17:00.570
He used the fact that we were
distressed, that we were

00:17:00.570 --> 00:17:02.920
uncomfortable, and he
figured out a way to

00:17:02.920 --> 00:17:04.339
push us through that.

00:17:04.339 --> 00:17:06.650
What's the final phase after
interest, distress?

00:17:06.650 --> 00:17:07.550
It's pleasure.

00:17:07.550 --> 00:17:09.660
You learn the new thing,
you feel good about it.

00:17:09.660 --> 00:17:14.079
What's your job as leader
or coach or teacher?

00:17:14.079 --> 00:17:18.500
It's to have sufficient empathy
with the people whom

00:17:18.500 --> 00:17:22.150
you're coaching so that you
understand where they are in

00:17:22.150 --> 00:17:25.940
the learning process, so that
you can gently apply or

00:17:25.940 --> 00:17:28.560
release pressure as needed.

00:17:28.560 --> 00:17:33.190
Empathy is the most important
attribute for a leader.

00:17:33.190 --> 00:17:36.230
Now let's think about leaders
you've known.

00:17:36.230 --> 00:17:39.740
Let's think about coaches you've
had, and how seldom you

00:17:39.740 --> 00:17:41.530
see empathy.

00:17:41.530 --> 00:17:45.700
How more often, you see a highly
directive approach that

00:17:45.700 --> 00:17:48.400
says, I'm in charge and I'm
going to tell you what to do,

00:17:48.400 --> 00:17:50.230
and you better learn this,
and if you don't, I'm

00:17:50.230 --> 00:17:52.340
going to blame you.

00:17:52.340 --> 00:17:56.790
So let's approach it a different
way-- empathy.

00:17:56.790 --> 00:17:59.080
Next phase of this whole
learning process-- oh, by the

00:17:59.080 --> 00:18:02.330
way, in an organization, what
makes empathy interesting is

00:18:02.330 --> 00:18:05.180
that not only do you have to
do it one-on-one, you might

00:18:05.180 --> 00:18:08.500
have to do it with a whole
group of people, because

00:18:08.500 --> 00:18:10.970
there's a whole coalition of
people in your organization

00:18:10.970 --> 00:18:13.410
who are having to learn
at the same time,

00:18:13.410 --> 00:18:14.330
at different speeds.

00:18:14.330 --> 00:18:17.290
So that makes it complicated
and takes practice.

00:18:17.290 --> 00:18:20.600
Let's turn now to the question
of mistakes.

00:18:20.600 --> 00:18:22.740
Simple lesson here--

00:18:22.740 --> 00:18:25.520
mistakes are to be cherished.

00:18:25.520 --> 00:18:26.700
Cherished.

00:18:26.700 --> 00:18:28.920
This is about Tova.

00:18:28.920 --> 00:18:31.380
My daughter Sarah back there
knows Tova well.

00:18:31.380 --> 00:18:37.500
One day, Tova, at age 28, last
year comes to me and she says,

00:18:37.500 --> 00:18:40.580
do you remember that play
I made when we were in a

00:18:40.580 --> 00:18:44.100
tournament in Connecticut
when I was 14?

00:18:44.100 --> 00:18:46.140
She's 28, and she's asking
me this question.

00:18:46.140 --> 00:18:48.400
Do you remember the play I
made in a tournament in

00:18:48.400 --> 00:18:49.500
Connecticut when I was 14?

00:18:49.500 --> 00:18:50.850
I said, yeah, I do.

00:18:50.850 --> 00:18:52.760
Because I remember
every tournament.

00:18:52.760 --> 00:18:54.820
And Tova, I said, you
made a great play.

00:18:54.820 --> 00:18:59.280
You were the sweeper on the
field, the last defender back.

00:18:59.280 --> 00:19:03.050
Our goalie came out, a shot
came towards the goal.

00:19:03.050 --> 00:19:06.580
Our goalie swatted it
out into the field.

00:19:06.580 --> 00:19:08.840
But the other team got
possession of the ball, and

00:19:08.840 --> 00:19:10.815
someone took a shot,
point-blank, right at the

00:19:10.815 --> 00:19:13.800
goal, and you, Tova, stood in
front of the goal and chested

00:19:13.800 --> 00:19:15.680
the ball down and
cleared it away.

00:19:15.680 --> 00:19:18.050
It was a great defensive play.

00:19:18.050 --> 00:19:21.146
She says, I don't remember
that one.

00:19:21.146 --> 00:19:22.750
I said, which one
do you remember?

00:19:22.750 --> 00:19:24.920
She says, well, the one I
remember was, I was playing

00:19:24.920 --> 00:19:26.970
sweeper, and a ball comes
flying towards the goal

00:19:26.970 --> 00:19:29.970
through the air, and I tried to
head it out, and instead, I

00:19:29.970 --> 00:19:33.800
deflected it into our goal for
the winning goal in the game

00:19:33.800 --> 00:19:35.590
in the tournament.

00:19:35.590 --> 00:19:37.430
I said, I don't remember
that one.

00:19:37.430 --> 00:19:39.080
And she says, I was
devastated.

00:19:39.080 --> 00:19:42.260
I was sitting on the grass after
the game, sobbing my

00:19:42.260 --> 00:19:45.060
heart out, knowing that I
caused us to lose the

00:19:45.060 --> 00:19:46.070
tournament.

00:19:46.070 --> 00:19:48.850
And you came up to me as coach,
and you said, Tova,

00:19:48.850 --> 00:19:49.520
don't worry about it.

00:19:49.520 --> 00:19:51.370
You're a great defender.

00:19:51.370 --> 00:19:52.710
I am?

00:19:52.710 --> 00:19:53.960
I said, yeah.

00:19:53.960 --> 00:19:57.730
Only the best defenders go out
after every single ball with a

00:19:57.730 --> 00:19:59.480
lot of energy and intent.

00:19:59.480 --> 00:20:02.940
And every now and then, it
deflects off of them and goes

00:20:02.940 --> 00:20:04.310
into the goal.

00:20:04.310 --> 00:20:05.400
Don't worry about it.

00:20:05.400 --> 00:20:07.810
You're a great defender.

00:20:07.810 --> 00:20:11.710
So she brushed herself off, at
age 14, walked away with her

00:20:11.710 --> 00:20:13.820
head up high, smiling,
saying to

00:20:13.820 --> 00:20:17.190
herself, I'm a great defender.

00:20:17.190 --> 00:20:20.870
Now she remembered this
14 years later.

00:20:20.870 --> 00:20:22.600
14 years later.

00:20:22.600 --> 00:20:25.970
And she was paying it forward to
people in the organizations

00:20:25.970 --> 00:20:27.530
in which she worked.

00:20:27.530 --> 00:20:28.480
What was she paying forward?

00:20:28.480 --> 00:20:32.970
She was paying forward the idea
that when someone has

00:20:32.970 --> 00:20:38.310
made a mistake and is going
through a hard time, a simple

00:20:38.310 --> 00:20:44.300
word of sympathy or empathy
can go a long way and help

00:20:44.300 --> 00:20:47.250
them through that phase, and
help them learn from the

00:20:47.250 --> 00:20:48.500
experience.

00:20:50.260 --> 00:20:53.520
So how do we learn from
the experience?

00:20:53.520 --> 00:20:55.100
We don't blame.

00:20:55.100 --> 00:20:57.410
We don't punish.

00:20:57.410 --> 00:21:00.040
As we like to say in the
hospital world, we want to be

00:21:00.040 --> 00:21:04.160
hard on the problem, but
not hard on the person.

00:21:04.160 --> 00:21:07.670
We want to say of the person,
anybody could

00:21:07.670 --> 00:21:09.220
have made that mistake.

00:21:09.220 --> 00:21:12.580
And indeed, as you think about
organizations, as you think

00:21:12.580 --> 00:21:16.660
about mistakes that are made,
in general, it's true that

00:21:16.660 --> 00:21:20.170
although a specific person may
have made the mistake, chances

00:21:20.170 --> 00:21:23.060
are anybody could have,
in the organization.

00:21:23.060 --> 00:21:23.390
Why?

00:21:23.390 --> 00:21:26.900
Because most of the errors that
occur in an organization,

00:21:26.900 --> 00:21:30.570
whether it's a hospital or a
place like this, are a result

00:21:30.570 --> 00:21:35.210
of systemic problems in the way
work is organized in that

00:21:35.210 --> 00:21:39.410
organization, and not because
someone is maliciously trying

00:21:39.410 --> 00:21:41.276
to make a mistake.

00:21:41.276 --> 00:21:45.050
I want to give you an example
from our hospital.

00:21:45.050 --> 00:21:48.230
A patient woke up from surgery,
orthopedic surgery,

00:21:48.230 --> 00:21:51.820
one day, looked down at her
ankle, and said, why is the

00:21:51.820 --> 00:21:55.460
bandage on my right leg instead
of my left leg?

00:21:55.460 --> 00:21:57.890
And it was at that moment that
her surgeon, standing right

00:21:57.890 --> 00:22:02.120
there, realized he had operated
on the wrong ankle.

00:22:02.120 --> 00:22:04.670
There's a technical term for
this in health care.

00:22:04.670 --> 00:22:07.850
It's called not good.

00:22:07.850 --> 00:22:09.640
You now can be a doctor.

00:22:09.640 --> 00:22:12.850
You want to operate on
the correct limb.

00:22:12.850 --> 00:22:18.200
Now this happens a
lot in the world.

00:22:18.200 --> 00:22:20.420
In America, I think there
are two or three or four

00:22:20.420 --> 00:22:24.520
wrong-site surgeries that
occur every week.

00:22:24.520 --> 00:22:26.360
A lot are more serious
than the one that

00:22:26.360 --> 00:22:27.940
this surgeon did--

00:22:27.940 --> 00:22:32.380
wrong breasts removed, wrong
testicles removed, or in the

00:22:32.380 --> 00:22:35.570
case of a poor guy from
Wisconsin with kidney cancer,

00:22:35.570 --> 00:22:37.990
the wrong kidney removed.

00:22:37.990 --> 00:22:39.150
Think about that.

00:22:39.150 --> 00:22:41.750
How on earth can this
possibly happen?

00:22:41.750 --> 00:22:45.090
Is it because doctors
are misanthropes who

00:22:45.090 --> 00:22:46.570
want to hurt people?

00:22:46.570 --> 00:22:50.030
No, in fact doctors are among
the most well-intentioned

00:22:50.030 --> 00:22:51.420
people in the world.

00:22:51.420 --> 00:22:54.470
They've devoted their lives to
alleviating human suffering

00:22:54.470 --> 00:22:56.270
caused by disease.

00:22:56.270 --> 00:22:59.710
They do not intentionally remove
the wrong breast or the

00:22:59.710 --> 00:23:02.550
wrong testicle or the wrong
kidney, or operate on the

00:23:02.550 --> 00:23:03.400
wrong ankle.

00:23:03.400 --> 00:23:04.840
How does it happen?

00:23:04.840 --> 00:23:08.310
Well, in this case, what
happened is that the surgeon

00:23:08.310 --> 00:23:09.820
had failed to do
what's called a

00:23:09.820 --> 00:23:12.840
time-out before the procedure.

00:23:12.840 --> 00:23:13.990
What's a time-out?

00:23:13.990 --> 00:23:16.730
Everybody in the OR stands
around the patient and says,

00:23:16.730 --> 00:23:18.630
what's the name of
the patient?

00:23:18.630 --> 00:23:20.480
What are we here to do today?

00:23:20.480 --> 00:23:22.130
What limb are we operating on?

00:23:22.130 --> 00:23:24.680
Is the limb marked so that we
know we're operating on the

00:23:24.680 --> 00:23:25.490
correct limb?

00:23:25.490 --> 00:23:27.840
He had not done that.

00:23:27.840 --> 00:23:28.580
Why?

00:23:28.580 --> 00:23:29.960
I'll tell you that in
a second, but he

00:23:29.960 --> 00:23:31.520
had not done that.

00:23:31.520 --> 00:23:34.900
So one of my trustees in the
hospital said to me, what are

00:23:34.900 --> 00:23:37.640
you going to do to punish
this doctor?

00:23:37.640 --> 00:23:39.780
And I said, nothing.

00:23:39.780 --> 00:23:40.990
He said, well, you should
punish him.

00:23:40.990 --> 00:23:42.730
He didn't follow our
time-out procedure.

00:23:42.730 --> 00:23:47.110
And I said, look, this guy is
already feeling more distress

00:23:47.110 --> 00:23:52.720
from his mistake and is
punishing himself more than

00:23:52.720 --> 00:23:54.880
anything we could
ever do to him.

00:23:54.880 --> 00:23:56.660
Why do we need to punish him?

00:23:56.660 --> 00:23:59.330
And then a colleague of mine
said, and furthermore, if we

00:23:59.330 --> 00:24:03.560
want to establish a culture
in this organization that

00:24:03.560 --> 00:24:07.760
encourages people to admit
mistakes and to admit

00:24:07.760 --> 00:24:11.260
near-misses so that we can
constantly improve as an

00:24:11.260 --> 00:24:14.700
organization, if we start
punishing people for mistakes

00:24:14.700 --> 00:24:19.420
that anyone could have made,
reporting will go underground.

00:24:19.420 --> 00:24:22.180
We'll never hear about
what's going wrong.

00:24:22.180 --> 00:24:23.360
And we don't want that.

00:24:23.360 --> 00:24:25.880
We want to be a learning
organization.

00:24:25.880 --> 00:24:27.240
And I said, yes, that's right.

00:24:27.240 --> 00:24:30.130
By the way, the trustee who was
trying to get me to punish

00:24:30.130 --> 00:24:33.310
this fellow, who said, OK, well,
if you say so, I guess

00:24:33.310 --> 00:24:36.150
we don't want to punish him,
but in my field we would

00:24:36.150 --> 00:24:37.050
punish him.

00:24:37.050 --> 00:24:38.740
What field was he in?

00:24:38.740 --> 00:24:40.420
Investment banking.

00:24:40.420 --> 00:24:40.715
Yeah.

00:24:40.715 --> 00:24:42.970
Yeah.

00:24:42.970 --> 00:24:45.500
I don't know about you, but as
I read the newspapers, it

00:24:45.500 --> 00:24:47.260
seems to me that when investment
bankers make

00:24:47.260 --> 00:24:49.140
mistakes, they get bonuses.

00:24:49.140 --> 00:24:51.310
Except in Iceland, where
they get put in jail.

00:24:54.615 --> 00:24:58.950
But what I want to do is
describe to you the nature of

00:24:58.950 --> 00:25:02.550
that error, to help you
understand even further why we

00:25:02.550 --> 00:25:05.670
didn't want to punish
this guy.

00:25:05.670 --> 00:25:11.210
So why did the surgeons
skip the time-out?

00:25:11.210 --> 00:25:14.240
It was a procedure that he
hadn't done in a while, a

00:25:14.240 --> 00:25:17.440
fairly complicated procedure,
on an ankle.

00:25:17.440 --> 00:25:22.310
He had studied it before the
surgery and was rehearsing it

00:25:22.310 --> 00:25:25.380
in his head over and over again
because he didn't want

00:25:25.380 --> 00:25:26.580
to get it wrong.

00:25:26.580 --> 00:25:30.150
So he was distracted by
the task at hand.

00:25:30.150 --> 00:25:32.550
In his view, the
task at hand--

00:25:32.550 --> 00:25:35.740
and doctors and nurses are
very task-oriented--

00:25:35.740 --> 00:25:38.930
the task at hand was to
do the surgery right.

00:25:38.930 --> 00:25:42.660
So I think we can forgive him
for forgetting a step along

00:25:42.660 --> 00:25:46.400
the way, this procedural
step along the way.

00:25:46.400 --> 00:25:48.920
What about other people
in the OR?

00:25:48.920 --> 00:25:52.050
The anesthesiologist, in
her previous case,

00:25:52.050 --> 00:25:53.730
had had a near miss.

00:25:53.730 --> 00:25:57.000
She had almost administered
the wrong medication to a

00:25:57.000 --> 00:26:02.070
patient with potentially fatal
consequences, fatal

00:26:02.070 --> 00:26:05.610
consequences, but caught
herself in time.

00:26:05.610 --> 00:26:08.540
And she was still stewing over
the fact that she'd almost

00:26:08.540 --> 00:26:09.910
made that mistake.

00:26:09.910 --> 00:26:12.690
Now if you or I made a mistake
like that, we would probably

00:26:12.690 --> 00:26:14.640
immediately tell five
or ten people, to

00:26:14.640 --> 00:26:16.620
get it off our chest.

00:26:16.620 --> 00:26:18.990
Doctors don't do that.

00:26:18.990 --> 00:26:22.280
Admitting mistakes on the part
of medical people is viewed as

00:26:22.280 --> 00:26:23.840
a sign of weakness.

00:26:23.840 --> 00:26:27.600
It tends to generate disdain
from their colleagues.

00:26:27.600 --> 00:26:29.810
Even though those same
colleagues would, in their

00:26:29.810 --> 00:26:35.570
brain, be saying, there but for
the grace of God go I. So

00:26:35.570 --> 00:26:39.935
she kept this to herself, and
she was fretting about this as

00:26:39.935 --> 00:26:41.620
she went into the OR.

00:26:41.620 --> 00:26:45.190
So she forgot about
the time-out.

00:26:45.190 --> 00:26:48.200
What about the nurse in the
OR, the circulating nurse?

00:26:48.200 --> 00:26:51.780
The person who's supposed to
document, check the checklist

00:26:51.780 --> 00:26:53.520
that the time-out
had taken place?

00:26:53.520 --> 00:26:55.930
Well, the circulating nurse
had left the OR for a few

00:26:55.930 --> 00:26:58.830
minutes to get something from
another room, had come back,

00:26:58.830 --> 00:27:03.270
the surgery had started, and
therefore he assumed the

00:27:03.270 --> 00:27:05.110
time-out had taken place.

00:27:05.110 --> 00:27:06.400
So he checked the checklist.

00:27:06.400 --> 00:27:10.250
After all, a checklist is meant
to be checked, right?

00:27:10.250 --> 00:27:12.950
Started, check.

00:27:12.950 --> 00:27:14.450
All right.

00:27:14.450 --> 00:27:16.020
It gets better than that.

00:27:16.020 --> 00:27:18.260
Gets better than that.

00:27:18.260 --> 00:27:21.740
The correct limb was marked.

00:27:21.740 --> 00:27:23.390
Yeah.

00:27:23.390 --> 00:27:26.580
It was marked, but
it was draped.

00:27:26.580 --> 00:27:30.930
Why didn't the surgeon
look for the mark?

00:27:30.930 --> 00:27:33.490
Why didn't anybody else in
the room look for a mark?

00:27:33.490 --> 00:27:35.610
And here we get to
a concept called

00:27:35.610 --> 00:27:38.510
normalization of deviance.

00:27:38.510 --> 00:27:42.940
This is a cognitive error that
occurs throughout the world.

00:27:45.580 --> 00:27:51.170
The classic example is the
Columbia Space Shuttle.

00:27:51.170 --> 00:27:52.800
Some of you may not
remember this.

00:27:52.800 --> 00:27:56.110
The space shuttle, as it was
flying back to Earth, because

00:27:56.110 --> 00:28:00.090
some heat shield tiles had come
off, burned up, killing

00:28:00.090 --> 00:28:01.260
all aboard.

00:28:01.260 --> 00:28:02.870
Why did that happen?

00:28:02.870 --> 00:28:08.140
During the takeoff, some foam
from the launchpad had broken

00:28:08.140 --> 00:28:11.290
off and had hit the
heat shield and

00:28:11.290 --> 00:28:14.760
broken off the tiles.

00:28:14.760 --> 00:28:18.040
Wasn't the first time, however,
that foam had broken

00:28:18.040 --> 00:28:19.565
off during a launch.

00:28:19.565 --> 00:28:22.180
It had happened at least
twice before.

00:28:22.180 --> 00:28:25.490
The first time it happened,
rocket takes off, the booster

00:28:25.490 --> 00:28:27.690
takes off, foam is
flying around.

00:28:27.690 --> 00:28:30.360
The NASA engineers say, what's
all this foam flying around?

00:28:30.360 --> 00:28:32.260
That's not supposed to happen.

00:28:32.260 --> 00:28:34.680
Gee, can't figure it out.

00:28:34.680 --> 00:28:36.290
It's not part of the
design spec, so we

00:28:36.290 --> 00:28:37.800
can't figure it out.

00:28:37.800 --> 00:28:41.590
But well, it doesn't seem
to do any harm.

00:28:41.590 --> 00:28:42.990
Second time, same thing.

00:28:42.990 --> 00:28:46.180
Takes off, foam flying around.

00:28:46.180 --> 00:28:49.880
Third time, they discovered that
a piece of foam going 150

00:28:49.880 --> 00:28:52.740
miles an hour has the same
amount of momentum as a cinder

00:28:52.740 --> 00:28:58.800
block when it hits heat tiles,
ceramic tiles, and damaged the

00:28:58.800 --> 00:29:01.880
space shuttle, burned
up coming down.

00:29:01.880 --> 00:29:07.170
This phenomenon of accepting
defects is called

00:29:07.170 --> 00:29:09.710
normalization of deviance.

00:29:09.710 --> 00:29:12.240
Normalization of deviance.

00:29:12.240 --> 00:29:15.370
Something goes wrong, we don't
see a consequence from it--

00:29:15.370 --> 00:29:19.000
even though we know it's wrong,
we don't act to fix it

00:29:19.000 --> 00:29:21.750
until a catastrophe occurs.

00:29:21.750 --> 00:29:26.360
In the pre-op area in our
operating rooms, where marking

00:29:26.360 --> 00:29:30.770
of body parts takes place, there
had been a shortage for

00:29:30.770 --> 00:29:35.090
several months of the indelible
markers that are

00:29:35.090 --> 00:29:37.900
used to mark body parts.

00:29:37.900 --> 00:29:43.560
So the doctors and nurses had
gotten used to using ballpoint

00:29:43.560 --> 00:29:47.330
pens to mark body
parts instead of

00:29:47.330 --> 00:29:49.390
the indelible markers.

00:29:49.390 --> 00:29:53.030
The problem with that is when
you swab Betadine on a limb

00:29:53.030 --> 00:29:55.280
that's been marked with
a ballpoint pen, it

00:29:55.280 --> 00:29:59.690
washes off the ink.

00:29:59.690 --> 00:30:03.480
Surgeons had gotten used to the
idea that they would not

00:30:03.480 --> 00:30:06.200
see a mark on the body part.

00:30:06.200 --> 00:30:08.295
Normalization of deviance.

00:30:08.295 --> 00:30:10.730
Isn't this fascinating?

00:30:10.730 --> 00:30:13.340
So now who do you blame?

00:30:13.340 --> 00:30:14.020
Who do you blame?

00:30:14.020 --> 00:30:16.990
Everybody who was in the pre-op
area for several months

00:30:16.990 --> 00:30:21.260
who never reported that
this was a problem?

00:30:21.260 --> 00:30:26.150
Everybody who had marked a limb
with a ballpoint pen?

00:30:26.150 --> 00:30:30.010
Every surgeon who had had a case
previously who didn't see

00:30:30.010 --> 00:30:33.540
a mark, because a ballpoint
pen had been used?

00:30:33.540 --> 00:30:36.610
Should it be the supply
department, because they

00:30:36.610 --> 00:30:38.970
didn't provide enough markers?

00:30:38.970 --> 00:30:42.670
So as you see, after a while,
if you go down this path,

00:30:42.670 --> 00:30:46.420
there's nobody to blame and
everybody to blame.

00:30:46.420 --> 00:30:48.890
But the point is, we don't
want to talk about blame.

00:30:48.890 --> 00:30:52.350
We want to be a learning
organization.

00:30:52.350 --> 00:30:53.940
We want to be a learning
organization.

00:30:53.940 --> 00:30:57.060
Now how do we get to that?

00:30:57.060 --> 00:31:03.170
We get to that by creating a
culture which enables people

00:31:03.170 --> 00:31:07.640
on the front line, encourages
and empowers them, to call out

00:31:07.640 --> 00:31:12.140
problems as they see them, and
requires leaders in the

00:31:12.140 --> 00:31:14.150
organization, managers and
other leaders in the

00:31:14.150 --> 00:31:17.800
organization, to be responsive
to those call-outs so the

00:31:17.800 --> 00:31:20.270
problems get fixed.

00:31:20.270 --> 00:31:25.930
And I'll end with a story about
that, that I think what

00:31:25.930 --> 00:31:28.640
will help crystallize
it for you.

00:31:28.640 --> 00:31:30.550
But let's go back to the
11-year-olds first.

00:31:30.550 --> 00:31:32.550
So this is about superstars.

00:31:35.130 --> 00:31:38.990
We had a young girl on our team
named Brooke, who was a

00:31:38.990 --> 00:31:40.740
spectacular soccer player.

00:31:40.740 --> 00:31:43.550
In particular, she was a
spectacular dribbler.

00:31:43.550 --> 00:31:46.540
She could take the ball and
dribble around anything.

00:31:46.540 --> 00:31:50.570
But the strategy of the team
was not to have a single

00:31:50.570 --> 00:31:52.420
player dribble down the field.

00:31:52.420 --> 00:31:55.970
The strategy of the team is to
pass to one another, because

00:31:55.970 --> 00:31:58.390
even a great player is going
to hit opposition from

00:31:58.390 --> 00:32:00.080
opposing players.

00:32:00.080 --> 00:32:02.240
And the way you get down the
field is you pass the ball to

00:32:02.240 --> 00:32:02.720
your teammates.

00:32:02.720 --> 00:32:05.690
When someone's open, you pass to
them, and you get the ball,

00:32:05.690 --> 00:32:06.460
and you pass again.

00:32:06.460 --> 00:32:08.720
Now, Brooke understood this,
and she was a great team

00:32:08.720 --> 00:32:12.000
player and very unselfish, would
always pass the ball to

00:32:12.000 --> 00:32:14.260
other teammates, just the
way she was supposed to.

00:32:14.260 --> 00:32:16.940
And our team had a spectacular
record.

00:32:16.940 --> 00:32:18.900
Well, on this particular day,
we were playing in a

00:32:18.900 --> 00:32:20.400
tournament-- these are
11-year-olds--

00:32:20.400 --> 00:32:26.080
and the team against which we
were playing wasn't as good as

00:32:26.080 --> 00:32:29.510
we were, and so they packed
the defense on the field.

00:32:29.510 --> 00:32:32.650
They put all their players right
in front of the goal.

00:32:32.650 --> 00:32:35.370
So our normal practice of going
down the field-- pass,

00:32:35.370 --> 00:32:37.040
pass, pass, shoot--

00:32:37.040 --> 00:32:39.680
wasn't working because they
would block the shot.

00:32:39.680 --> 00:32:41.730
There were just too many
of them in the way.

00:32:41.730 --> 00:32:43.510
And our girls were getting
really frustrated, and at

00:32:43.510 --> 00:32:44.510
halftime, it was 0-0.

00:32:44.510 --> 00:32:45.860
And it's a tournament game.

00:32:45.860 --> 00:32:48.090
You gotta win in tournaments.

00:32:48.090 --> 00:32:51.040
So in front of all the girls,
I say to Brooke, Brooke,

00:32:51.040 --> 00:32:53.410
you're a spectacular dribbler,
and normally, I want you to

00:32:53.410 --> 00:32:54.415
pass to other players.

00:32:54.415 --> 00:32:57.600
It's part of our
team approach.

00:32:57.600 --> 00:33:00.885
But just this once, next time
you get the ball, just walk it

00:33:00.885 --> 00:33:02.730
into the goal.

00:33:02.730 --> 00:33:04.850
She says, what do you mean?

00:33:04.850 --> 00:33:07.720
Slight grin appearing
on her mouth.

00:33:07.720 --> 00:33:10.580
I said, get the ball, dribble
through those other players,

00:33:10.580 --> 00:33:12.060
and just score.

00:33:12.060 --> 00:33:13.640
OK, Coach, she says.

00:33:13.640 --> 00:33:14.920
I can do this.

00:33:14.920 --> 00:33:18.930
So we start up, she gets the
ball on the 35-yard line.

00:33:18.930 --> 00:33:20.070
Doot-doot-doot-doot-doot.

00:33:20.070 --> 00:33:20.710
Scores.

00:33:20.710 --> 00:33:23.460
I mean, it took 10 seconds.

00:33:23.460 --> 00:33:25.960
High fives from the
whole team, right?

00:33:25.960 --> 00:33:28.700
Now if Brooke had usually
played that way, there

00:33:28.700 --> 00:33:30.640
would've been a lot
of resentment.

00:33:30.640 --> 00:33:32.820
But because the whole team
understood it was part of the

00:33:32.820 --> 00:33:37.050
strategy to use the attributes
of our superstar, it was

00:33:37.050 --> 00:33:37.530
acceptable.

00:33:37.530 --> 00:33:38.610
It was more than acceptable.

00:33:38.610 --> 00:33:41.350
It was great.

00:33:41.350 --> 00:33:45.470
So lesson one, here.

00:33:45.470 --> 00:33:48.310
Every organization
has superstars.

00:33:48.310 --> 00:33:51.560
It's fine to use their
attributes that are different

00:33:51.560 --> 00:33:53.020
from other people,
as long as it's

00:33:53.020 --> 00:33:56.000
part of the team strategy.

00:33:56.000 --> 00:33:59.430
Lesson two-- a little
more subtle.

00:33:59.430 --> 00:34:02.090
We can find superstars
everywhere in the

00:34:02.090 --> 00:34:04.210
organization.

00:34:04.210 --> 00:34:07.500
Every single person in a place
like this has certain

00:34:07.500 --> 00:34:11.630
characteristics, skills, or
attributes that are different

00:34:11.630 --> 00:34:15.389
from other people, that can be
brought to bear to carry out

00:34:15.389 --> 00:34:19.040
the purposes of the organization
if we give that

00:34:19.040 --> 00:34:24.360
person the freedom to
offer those skills.

00:34:24.360 --> 00:34:25.560
I want to tell you about Gloria

00:34:25.560 --> 00:34:29.550
Martinez, in our hospital.

00:34:29.550 --> 00:34:32.090
Gloria was a transporter.

00:34:32.090 --> 00:34:33.280
A transporter is one of the

00:34:33.280 --> 00:34:35.139
lowest-paid jobs in the hospital.

00:34:35.139 --> 00:34:37.050
It's an entry-level job.

00:34:37.050 --> 00:34:41.610
Transporters push beds around,
and wheelchairs with patients,

00:34:41.610 --> 00:34:45.120
delivering them from one place
to the other, and also deliver

00:34:45.120 --> 00:34:49.420
specimens from the various
departments to the pathology

00:34:49.420 --> 00:34:51.639
lab to be analyzed.

00:34:51.639 --> 00:34:55.230
This is like a no-brain
operation, right?

00:34:55.230 --> 00:35:00.060
I pick it up, I walk
over, I deliver it.

00:35:00.060 --> 00:35:04.860
Gloria, one day, noticed that
specimens from our GI

00:35:04.860 --> 00:35:08.200
department were not
getting delivered

00:35:08.200 --> 00:35:10.590
consistently to the path lab.

00:35:10.590 --> 00:35:13.100
They would be lost
occasionally.

00:35:13.100 --> 00:35:16.420
And she took it upon herself to
tell her supervisor about

00:35:16.420 --> 00:35:20.030
this, because she figured it
was important for those

00:35:20.030 --> 00:35:21.950
specimens to be delivered.

00:35:21.950 --> 00:35:25.470
Now those of you of a certain
age who've had colonoscopies--

00:35:25.470 --> 00:35:27.360
and the rest of you
will someday.

00:35:27.360 --> 00:35:31.670
This is a wonderful procedure
you'll really get to enjoy--

00:35:31.670 --> 00:35:34.700
know that the idea of a
colonoscopy is to take a look

00:35:34.700 --> 00:35:41.100
at your colon from the inside,
and if the doctor sees a polyp

00:35:41.100 --> 00:35:48.390
growing on the inside of your
colon, she clips it off, and

00:35:48.390 --> 00:35:50.350
they send it to the lab, because
they want to know if

00:35:50.350 --> 00:35:54.370
it's cancerous or
precancerous.

00:35:54.370 --> 00:35:57.120
In today's world, we can
actually eliminate colon

00:35:57.120 --> 00:35:59.305
cancer by this kind of
early detection.

00:36:02.030 --> 00:36:06.180
So if a sample gets lost on the
way to the path lab and

00:36:06.180 --> 00:36:10.450
someone is not diagnosed with
precancerous polyps or

00:36:10.450 --> 00:36:14.140
cancerous polyps, a year or two
later, they're going to

00:36:14.140 --> 00:36:16.590
have colon cancer.

00:36:16.590 --> 00:36:19.150
So it's an important test.

00:36:19.150 --> 00:36:24.030
And Gloria, maybe not knowing
why it was important,

00:36:24.030 --> 00:36:26.520
understood that it was important
for these samples to

00:36:26.520 --> 00:36:27.530
get delivered.

00:36:27.530 --> 00:36:29.800
And so when they weren't getting
delivered, she called

00:36:29.800 --> 00:36:33.660
out this problem to
her supervisor.

00:36:33.660 --> 00:36:36.880
Now I don't want to stereotype
here, but let me tell you

00:36:36.880 --> 00:36:37.480
about Gloria.

00:36:37.480 --> 00:36:41.260
Gloria is a recent immigrant
from Latin America.

00:36:41.260 --> 00:36:43.610
Her primary language
is Spanish.

00:36:43.610 --> 00:36:45.070
The family is not well-off.

00:36:45.070 --> 00:36:47.005
She's a high school-educated
person.

00:36:50.590 --> 00:36:53.500
I would suggest to you that
it's highly likely--

00:36:53.500 --> 00:36:56.920
I've met her family-- it's
highly likely that her large

00:36:56.920 --> 00:37:00.090
extended family of cousins and
uncles and aunts and parents

00:37:00.090 --> 00:37:03.770
and grandparents does not say
to Gloria every day when she

00:37:03.770 --> 00:37:06.920
goes to work, make sure you find
something wrong in the

00:37:06.920 --> 00:37:09.650
work environment and make
a fuss about it.

00:37:09.650 --> 00:37:10.000
No.

00:37:10.000 --> 00:37:13.480
More likely they say to her,
you're lucky to have a job.

00:37:13.480 --> 00:37:15.480
Keep your head down.

00:37:15.480 --> 00:37:19.330
But Gloria felt comfortable,
because of the culture we had

00:37:19.330 --> 00:37:23.170
established in our hospital,
calling out this problem.

00:37:23.170 --> 00:37:26.440
Her supervisor, her leader,
her coach, had also been

00:37:26.440 --> 00:37:30.470
trained so that when Gloria
called out the problem, he

00:37:30.470 --> 00:37:33.430
said in a kind, pleasant way--

00:37:33.430 --> 00:37:35.100
he did not say, I'm
busy right now.

00:37:35.100 --> 00:37:36.640
Tell me about it later.

00:37:36.640 --> 00:37:39.710
No, he said, thank you
so much, Gloria,

00:37:39.710 --> 00:37:40.600
for mentioning this.

00:37:40.600 --> 00:37:41.400
This is important.

00:37:41.400 --> 00:37:42.710
We're going to get on it.

00:37:42.710 --> 00:37:45.760
And as a result of her call-out,
that one time, we

00:37:45.760 --> 00:37:48.670
totally revamped the way
specimens were tracked and

00:37:48.670 --> 00:37:50.860
collected in our hospital.

00:37:50.860 --> 00:37:54.320
Gloria, personally, probably
saved some lives.

00:37:54.320 --> 00:37:56.710
She may have saved as many
lives as some of the GI

00:37:56.710 --> 00:38:01.260
doctors, if you think
about it.

00:38:01.260 --> 00:38:03.540
Around this time, we had created
what we call our

00:38:03.540 --> 00:38:05.820
Caller-Outer of the
Month award.

00:38:05.820 --> 00:38:08.530
This was an award from our
Board of Trustees to

00:38:08.530 --> 00:38:10.590
acknowledge someone in
the company who had

00:38:10.590 --> 00:38:11.560
called out a problem.

00:38:11.560 --> 00:38:14.460
Not solved a problem, but called
out a problem, because

00:38:14.460 --> 00:38:16.410
we want to encourage
these call-outs.

00:38:16.410 --> 00:38:19.950
Gloria gets the first award,
which is a letter from me and

00:38:19.950 --> 00:38:22.270
two tickets to Fenway Park
to watch the Red Sox.

00:38:22.270 --> 00:38:26.440
That's a baseball team we
have on the other coast.

00:38:26.440 --> 00:38:27.620
Although this year, they really

00:38:27.620 --> 00:38:28.820
weren't a baseball team.

00:38:28.820 --> 00:38:30.180
They were something else.

00:38:30.180 --> 00:38:31.530
Yeah, they were awful.

00:38:31.530 --> 00:38:32.120
They were awful.

00:38:32.120 --> 00:38:35.950
It was over by July 4.

00:38:35.950 --> 00:38:37.800
So here's Gloria, getting
this award.

00:38:37.800 --> 00:38:41.770
Imagine her, 23 years old, her
background, her not-so-good

00:38:41.770 --> 00:38:45.690
English, getting an award from
the suits, the people on the

00:38:45.690 --> 00:38:48.120
board, the real estate
people, the

00:38:48.120 --> 00:38:50.150
attorneys, the finance people.

00:38:50.150 --> 00:38:51.410
It's pretty intimidating.

00:38:51.410 --> 00:38:53.260
We give her the award,
and she says the

00:38:53.260 --> 00:38:55.770
following, in these words.

00:38:55.770 --> 00:38:59.440
Thank you so much for this
award, which I accept on

00:38:59.440 --> 00:39:03.120
behalf of all of the
transporters who work here,

00:39:03.120 --> 00:39:06.540
who believe that our job is to
deliver the kind of care to

00:39:06.540 --> 00:39:12.270
patients that we would want for
members of our own family.

00:39:12.270 --> 00:39:15.420
I had board members crying
when she said that.

00:39:15.420 --> 00:39:16.230
Why?

00:39:16.230 --> 00:39:20.930
Because she had codified
elegantly, in one sentence,

00:39:20.930 --> 00:39:26.010
the purpose of our hospital,
that all those board members

00:39:26.010 --> 00:39:29.430
were volunteering their time and
effort and money for, to

00:39:29.430 --> 00:39:32.510
create an institution that would
deliver the kind of care

00:39:32.510 --> 00:39:35.250
to any patient that you
or I would want for a

00:39:35.250 --> 00:39:36.780
member of our family.

00:39:36.780 --> 00:39:38.080
And Gloria got it.

00:39:38.080 --> 00:39:40.560
For me, it was one of the most
satisfying days working in

00:39:40.560 --> 00:39:41.260
that hospital.

00:39:41.260 --> 00:39:42.180
Why?

00:39:42.180 --> 00:39:45.890
Because it indicated that the
cultural change we had made in

00:39:45.890 --> 00:39:49.630
the hospital, in terms of
everybody feeling ownership

00:39:49.630 --> 00:39:53.290
with regard to the purpose of
the organization, feeling

00:39:53.290 --> 00:39:57.250
empowered to call out problems,
to make suggestions,

00:39:57.250 --> 00:40:00.050
and to have a leadership team
in the organization that was

00:40:00.050 --> 00:40:05.200
responsive to those call-outs,
had succeeded.

00:40:05.200 --> 00:40:08.400
It was a wonderful moment.

00:40:08.400 --> 00:40:11.410
So let me stop there with
stories, and we can take some

00:40:11.410 --> 00:40:13.630
questions or observations.

00:40:13.630 --> 00:40:14.500
Let me just summarize.

00:40:14.500 --> 00:40:15.310
Let's think about it.

00:40:15.310 --> 00:40:18.980
Your job as leader,
you're the coach.

00:40:18.980 --> 00:40:22.680
Your job is to help people
learn, to create a learning

00:40:22.680 --> 00:40:25.360
organization that can respond
to whatever's going on,

00:40:25.360 --> 00:40:27.210
internally and externally.

00:40:27.210 --> 00:40:30.450
To think about that learning
cycle of interest, distress,

00:40:30.450 --> 00:40:31.470
and pleasure.

00:40:31.470 --> 00:40:34.690
To have empathy for people as
individuals and groups of

00:40:34.690 --> 00:40:37.350
people, to help them through
the learning cycle.

00:40:37.350 --> 00:40:39.780
To cherish mistakes--

00:40:39.780 --> 00:40:42.200
not to blame people for
mistakes, to help them through

00:40:42.200 --> 00:40:45.690
the mistakes and to help them
learn from the states.

00:40:45.690 --> 00:40:47.670
And then finally, to recognize
that everybody

00:40:47.670 --> 00:40:49.610
is a potential superstar.

00:40:49.610 --> 00:40:51.550
We don't have to do
a draft choice.

00:40:51.550 --> 00:40:52.840
Who's our recruiter
over there?

00:40:52.840 --> 00:40:54.380
We don't have to do
a draft choice.

00:40:54.380 --> 00:40:58.350
Everybody can contribute
to the purpose of the

00:40:58.350 --> 00:40:59.610
organization.

00:40:59.610 --> 00:41:02.840
But fundamentally to understand
that your job as

00:41:02.840 --> 00:41:07.360
leader is to believe that the
people with whom you're

00:41:07.360 --> 00:41:13.100
working want to do well in their
job and want to do good

00:41:13.100 --> 00:41:17.600
for the world, and that you can
trust them, that they will

00:41:17.600 --> 00:41:22.030
actually hold themselves
accountable to a standard of

00:41:22.030 --> 00:41:28.920
performance and care and
diligence in a much more vital

00:41:28.920 --> 00:41:32.200
and real way than you
can ever hold them

00:41:32.200 --> 00:41:35.210
accountable as their leader.

00:41:35.210 --> 00:41:36.560
You can't do it from the top.

00:41:36.560 --> 00:41:38.990
They have to feel
it internally.

00:41:38.990 --> 00:41:42.400
They will feel it internally if
you create an environment

00:41:42.400 --> 00:41:44.900
that allows them to do
what they want to do

00:41:44.900 --> 00:41:46.160
in the first place--

00:41:46.160 --> 00:41:49.850
to do well, and to do good.

00:41:49.850 --> 00:41:50.500
OK.

00:41:50.500 --> 00:41:52.100
I'm going to stop right
there, and see if

00:41:52.100 --> 00:41:54.404
there are any questions.

00:41:54.404 --> 00:41:56.430
AUDIENCE: I have a question
about empathy.

00:41:56.430 --> 00:42:00.660
You talked about that in
leadership it's important to

00:42:00.660 --> 00:42:04.780
have empathy to everyone.

00:42:04.780 --> 00:42:08.670
But there is also a leadership
style that says about a

00:42:08.670 --> 00:42:13.640
healthy mixture of fear and
respect is also needed.

00:42:13.640 --> 00:42:15.340
What are your thoughts
on that?

00:42:15.340 --> 00:42:18.830
PAUL LEVY: Well some leaders
do rule through fear.

00:42:18.830 --> 00:42:21.270
And it can be extremely
effective.

00:42:25.376 --> 00:42:31.480
And an organization can do
all right for some time.

00:42:31.480 --> 00:42:34.620
Generally, though, you'll find
that the organization will not

00:42:34.620 --> 00:42:38.230
do well for a long period of
time or when there are

00:42:38.230 --> 00:42:41.370
structural changes that occur
in that industry.

00:42:41.370 --> 00:42:48.050
And the reason for that is
no single person can be

00:42:48.050 --> 00:42:52.130
knowledgeable enough to
anticipate all those changes

00:42:52.130 --> 00:42:54.120
and to design where
the organization

00:42:54.120 --> 00:42:55.840
should go in the future.

00:42:55.840 --> 00:42:56.850
No one is good enough.

00:42:56.850 --> 00:43:00.400
The Soviet Union used to try
to, you know, the Politburo

00:43:00.400 --> 00:43:05.060
used to try to run the Soviet
economy from on high.

00:43:05.060 --> 00:43:10.050
It works for a while, but it
doesn't work after a while.

00:43:10.050 --> 00:43:13.350
The best ideas in an
organization tend to come from

00:43:13.350 --> 00:43:16.880
people on the front line who
notice a problem or notice

00:43:16.880 --> 00:43:19.620
that a competitor is doing
something else, and says, you

00:43:19.620 --> 00:43:22.570
know, maybe we should do
something about that.

00:43:22.570 --> 00:43:24.990
So it can work for a while.

00:43:24.990 --> 00:43:26.090
Some people like it.

00:43:26.090 --> 00:43:29.650
By the way, some people like
working in an environment

00:43:29.650 --> 00:43:35.730
where the boss is heavy-handed
and makes them fearful.

00:43:35.730 --> 00:43:41.050
And some people like being in
a marriage or a relationship

00:43:41.050 --> 00:43:44.230
where there's an abusive
relationship as well.

00:43:44.230 --> 00:43:45.360
It takes all types.

00:43:45.360 --> 00:43:49.140
I don't particularly like that,
and I think most people

00:43:49.140 --> 00:43:50.820
don't respond that way.

00:43:50.820 --> 00:43:54.380
And I certainly think that most
professional people--

00:43:54.380 --> 00:43:56.950
highly-educated, intelligent,
thoughtful people--

00:43:56.950 --> 00:43:59.590
do not like that at all.

00:43:59.590 --> 00:44:02.140
The reason they're professional
people is because

00:44:02.140 --> 00:44:05.240
they have enough sense of self
that they think they can

00:44:05.240 --> 00:44:09.270
self-motivate, and they can.

00:44:09.270 --> 00:44:12.070
AUDIENCE: There are people who
intentionally make mistakes,

00:44:12.070 --> 00:44:15.040
or who intentionally
do bad things.

00:44:15.040 --> 00:44:19.125
So what do you do when you catch
those people who are

00:44:19.125 --> 00:44:20.710
outliers, maybe?

00:44:20.710 --> 00:44:21.560
PAUL LEVY: Yeah.

00:44:21.560 --> 00:44:23.980
So there are people who
intentionally make mistakes

00:44:23.980 --> 00:44:25.500
and cause damage.

00:44:25.500 --> 00:44:28.220
I would suggest to you, first
of all, it's a very, very,

00:44:28.220 --> 00:44:30.090
very small percentage.

00:44:30.090 --> 00:44:33.540
Most people are not misanthropes
and jerks.

00:44:33.540 --> 00:44:35.080
Most people are like
you and me.

00:44:35.080 --> 00:44:37.090
We want to do well, we want to
do good, and when we make a

00:44:37.090 --> 00:44:41.720
mistake, we tend to feel badly
about it, and we hope not to

00:44:41.720 --> 00:44:42.970
do it again.

00:44:45.840 --> 00:44:49.120
If you believe that someone
really intentionally is

00:44:49.120 --> 00:44:54.280
sabotaging an organization or
a team or whatever out of

00:44:54.280 --> 00:44:59.460
negligence or intent, real
intent, they really want to

00:44:59.460 --> 00:45:00.170
destroy it?

00:45:00.170 --> 00:45:01.330
Get rid of them.

00:45:01.330 --> 00:45:01.970
Get rid of them.

00:45:01.970 --> 00:45:04.890
Zero tolerance for that.

00:45:04.890 --> 00:45:08.720
As I say, very small
percentage.

00:45:08.720 --> 00:45:11.210
I think what you'll find,
though, most of the time when

00:45:11.210 --> 00:45:16.550
people are not performing in a
job, that it relates to one of

00:45:16.550 --> 00:45:17.970
a few things.

00:45:17.970 --> 00:45:20.330
The most common problem I've
seen when people make a

00:45:20.330 --> 00:45:23.700
mistake or are not performing
in a job, the most common

00:45:23.700 --> 00:45:27.550
problem is that something's
going wrong at home.

00:45:27.550 --> 00:45:30.370
They're having a problem with
a sick relative, a spouse, a

00:45:30.370 --> 00:45:32.280
child, whatever it is.

00:45:32.280 --> 00:45:34.440
And they can't get it out of
their mind and they're not

00:45:34.440 --> 00:45:37.030
focused correctly
on their work.

00:45:37.030 --> 00:45:39.150
And our job, at that point, is
to help them through that,

00:45:39.150 --> 00:45:41.240
just as you would
help a friend.

00:45:41.240 --> 00:45:42.840
Problem number two.

00:45:42.840 --> 00:45:45.990
They don't really know what
to do in the job.

00:45:45.990 --> 00:45:48.290
They don't have the skills.

00:45:48.290 --> 00:45:49.380
Why?

00:45:49.380 --> 00:45:52.670
Well, maybe we haven't
trained them enough.

00:45:52.670 --> 00:45:58.150
There was a nurse in Brazil who
made a fatal mistake in a

00:45:58.150 --> 00:46:00.840
clinic in Rio de Janeiro.

00:46:00.840 --> 00:46:04.830
She's now being tried for
involuntary manslaughter.

00:46:04.830 --> 00:46:07.040
The problem, the real problem
was, she wasn't trained

00:46:07.040 --> 00:46:10.380
properly for the procedure
she was told to do.

00:46:10.380 --> 00:46:12.920
She actually did not
know that she was

00:46:12.920 --> 00:46:15.890
incompetent to do that procedure.

00:46:15.890 --> 00:46:16.980
Whose fault is that?

00:46:16.980 --> 00:46:18.100
Is that her fault?

00:46:18.100 --> 00:46:18.720
I don't think so.

00:46:18.720 --> 00:46:20.600
I think it's her
leader's fault.

00:46:27.080 --> 00:46:29.830
So the second category of
problems, if somebody doesn't

00:46:29.830 --> 00:46:32.750
know how to do the job right,
let's train them.

00:46:32.750 --> 00:46:36.610
It might be, however, that
they're not trainable in that

00:46:36.610 --> 00:46:38.940
particular skill.

00:46:38.940 --> 00:46:41.130
And we have to admit that
some people are not.

00:46:41.130 --> 00:46:43.900
I mean, I'm never going to be
a Major League baseball

00:46:43.900 --> 00:46:46.130
pitcher, no matter how many
times I would try.

00:46:48.750 --> 00:46:51.060
Let's move them to
a different job.

00:46:51.060 --> 00:46:53.540
Let's find a job that is
more suited to their

00:46:53.540 --> 00:46:55.890
characteristics, their skills,
their aptitudes.

00:46:58.690 --> 00:47:01.840
Sometimes there's a problem in
the work environment in which

00:47:01.840 --> 00:47:04.290
somebody is placed, that they're
not getting along with

00:47:04.290 --> 00:47:07.110
other people or with their
supervisor, or whatever.

00:47:07.110 --> 00:47:09.680
That's a difficult problem that
requires some counseling,

00:47:09.680 --> 00:47:11.800
of everybody, usually.

00:47:11.800 --> 00:47:13.800
And then once you get through
that whole list--

00:47:13.800 --> 00:47:16.520
I would say that's 95%
of the cases--

00:47:16.520 --> 00:47:20.280
then in a very small amount of
cases, this person really

00:47:20.280 --> 00:47:21.470
shouldn't be here.

00:47:21.470 --> 00:47:23.890
Not because they're a
misanthrope or a jerk, but

00:47:23.890 --> 00:47:25.750
they're just not suited
to the place.

00:47:25.750 --> 00:47:28.410
And then we should ask
them to leave.

00:47:28.410 --> 00:47:31.030
As often as not, I've found
that when it gets to that

00:47:31.030 --> 00:47:34.990
point, the person is so relieved
to leave that they

00:47:34.990 --> 00:47:37.300
feel like you're doing
them a favor.

00:47:37.300 --> 00:47:39.340
So that's my take on that.

00:47:39.340 --> 00:47:41.620
Thanks for raising it.

00:47:41.620 --> 00:47:44.060
AUDIENCE: For the most part I
think it's true that people

00:47:44.060 --> 00:47:47.430
prefer kind of an egalitarianism
an autonomous

00:47:47.430 --> 00:47:48.830
work environment.

00:47:48.830 --> 00:47:51.430
But they've also shown
that there's kind of

00:47:51.430 --> 00:47:52.480
like a sliding scale.

00:47:52.480 --> 00:47:57.360
So in very stressful situations
or when things kind

00:47:57.360 --> 00:48:01.010
of take a turn for the south,
people actually prefer

00:48:01.010 --> 00:48:03.260
aggressive leaders,
top-down leaders.

00:48:03.260 --> 00:48:05.560
So I'm wondering, in your
personal experience, how to

00:48:05.560 --> 00:48:09.320
recognize that point, and if you
have any personal examples

00:48:09.320 --> 00:48:13.220
of when you've had to kind of
change from the egalitarian,

00:48:13.220 --> 00:48:19.050
empathetic model to more of a
top-down, you're the leader--

00:48:19.050 --> 00:48:21.130
PAUL LEVY: I actually have not
found that to be the case.

00:48:21.130 --> 00:48:22.750
I know people talk about
it that way.

00:48:22.750 --> 00:48:25.990
But we had an example
in our hospital--

00:48:25.990 --> 00:48:28.490
Cat talked about it briefly.

00:48:28.490 --> 00:48:31.430
During 2009, the economy
tumbled.

00:48:31.430 --> 00:48:36.210
Revenue to our hospital went
through the floor.

00:48:36.210 --> 00:48:39.110
Instead of projecting a $20
million loss, by halfway

00:48:39.110 --> 00:48:40.380
through the year we
were projecting--

00:48:40.380 --> 00:48:41.890
I mean a gain.

00:48:41.890 --> 00:48:43.770
By halfway through the year,
we were projecting a $20

00:48:43.770 --> 00:48:44.600
million loss.

00:48:44.600 --> 00:48:48.510
So a $40 million shift
in six months.

00:48:48.510 --> 00:48:51.240
My CFO and COO came to
me and said, we need

00:48:51.240 --> 00:48:54.186
to lay off 400 people.

00:48:54.186 --> 00:48:56.000
That's how we have to
solve this problem.

00:48:58.500 --> 00:49:00.150
And I said, no, I'd
rather not.

00:49:00.150 --> 00:49:02.460
Let's talk to folks and see
what ideas we could get to

00:49:02.460 --> 00:49:03.970
solve this problem.

00:49:03.970 --> 00:49:06.100
And they looked at me like I was
crazy, and they said, no,

00:49:06.100 --> 00:49:06.730
you don't understand.

00:49:06.730 --> 00:49:07.900
We need to act quickly.

00:49:07.900 --> 00:49:11.210
We need to identify the people,
and-- this was March

00:49:11.210 --> 00:49:13.780
1-- by April 1, have
it in place.

00:49:13.780 --> 00:49:15.250
Because we're losing hundreds
of thousands

00:49:15.250 --> 00:49:17.920
of dollars per week.

00:49:17.920 --> 00:49:20.570
And I said, well, let's
just give it a try.

00:49:20.570 --> 00:49:23.130
So what did I do?

00:49:23.130 --> 00:49:26.650
I called people together
in town meetings.

00:49:26.650 --> 00:49:30.220
I had the CFO explain the
financial situation in about

00:49:30.220 --> 00:49:31.720
five minutes.

00:49:31.720 --> 00:49:35.350
And then I said to the
staff, look, we have

00:49:35.350 --> 00:49:36.260
some options here.

00:49:36.260 --> 00:49:42.590
One is I could assert authority
and eliminate a

00:49:42.590 --> 00:49:45.000
number of hundreds of
positions here.

00:49:45.000 --> 00:49:49.450
The other thing we could do is
together decide on sacrifices

00:49:49.450 --> 00:49:52.970
that we would all take, small
sacrifices we would all take

00:49:52.970 --> 00:49:56.270
to solve this problem.

00:49:56.270 --> 00:49:59.660
Whether it's pay cuts or freezes
or whatever it is or

00:49:59.660 --> 00:50:04.030
other things, I'd rather do
that, because we're in the

00:50:04.030 --> 00:50:06.520
middle of a recession
right now.

00:50:06.520 --> 00:50:09.450
The unemployment rate
was about 8%.

00:50:09.450 --> 00:50:12.993
If I fire one of you, it's going
to be really hard for

00:50:12.993 --> 00:50:14.630
you to get another job.

00:50:14.630 --> 00:50:18.220
And at an 8% unemployment rate,
statistically one in 12

00:50:18.220 --> 00:50:21.750
of your spouses is currently out
of work, and I don't want

00:50:21.750 --> 00:50:23.800
to create non-working
families.

00:50:23.800 --> 00:50:26.280
So what do you say about us
coming together and coming up

00:50:26.280 --> 00:50:26.840
with ideas?

00:50:26.840 --> 00:50:28.580
And they're nodding and they're
smiling, they're

00:50:28.580 --> 00:50:29.950
feeling good about it.

00:50:29.950 --> 00:50:33.270
And then I say to them, I also
want to run another idea by

00:50:33.270 --> 00:50:35.560
you to see what you
think about it.

00:50:35.560 --> 00:50:37.420
There are people in
this hospital--

00:50:37.420 --> 00:50:39.850
the transporters, the food
service workers, the

00:50:39.850 --> 00:50:41.270
housekeepers--

00:50:41.270 --> 00:50:44.560
who don't earn very much
money to start with.

00:50:44.560 --> 00:50:49.410
What would you think about the
idea of exempting them from

00:50:49.410 --> 00:50:54.520
any of the sacrifices the rest
of us take, understanding that

00:50:54.520 --> 00:50:56.320
it means that everybody else
is going to have to take a

00:50:56.320 --> 00:50:59.980
slightly bigger sacrifice to
compensate for those several

00:50:59.980 --> 00:51:01.530
hundreds of people.

00:51:01.530 --> 00:51:03.810
The room burst into applause.

00:51:03.810 --> 00:51:05.135
Burst into applause.

00:51:05.135 --> 00:51:08.700
It was a very moving moment.

00:51:08.700 --> 00:51:09.840
So what do we do?

00:51:09.840 --> 00:51:14.370
So we set up chat rooms, I have
my blog, I have email,

00:51:14.370 --> 00:51:16.650
I've been walking around
town meetings.

00:51:16.650 --> 00:51:18.800
And I said, send
me your ideas.

00:51:18.800 --> 00:51:20.340
Send me your ideas.

00:51:20.340 --> 00:51:24.590
And so I got thousands
of ideas.

00:51:24.590 --> 00:51:26.460
The book tells you
how many we got.

00:51:26.460 --> 00:51:30.950
And then a week or so later, I
put out a memo, an email to

00:51:30.950 --> 00:51:33.310
the staff, saying, here are the
major ideas I've received.

00:51:36.680 --> 00:51:39.130
Here's how they would
work or not work.

00:51:39.130 --> 00:51:42.020
Here's a smaller group that
I'm considering for the

00:51:42.020 --> 00:51:45.730
future, that I'll decide upon.

00:51:45.730 --> 00:51:47.970
Let me know what you
think about those.

00:51:47.970 --> 00:51:52.200
They commented on those, and
then a week or so later, I put

00:51:52.200 --> 00:51:54.340
out the final memo, saying,
OK, here's what

00:51:54.340 --> 00:51:56.310
we're going to do.

00:51:56.310 --> 00:51:57.550
Thanks for your suggestions.

00:51:57.550 --> 00:52:00.500
I couldn't adopt all of
your suggestions.

00:52:00.500 --> 00:52:04.210
In adopting a suggestion or
not adopting one of your

00:52:04.210 --> 00:52:07.310
suggestions, it doesn't mean
that I didn't think

00:52:07.310 --> 00:52:08.660
you had a good idea.

00:52:08.660 --> 00:52:12.060
It just means that my final
responsibility here is to make

00:52:12.060 --> 00:52:13.960
the final decisions on this.

00:52:13.960 --> 00:52:16.930
And I have to feel comfortable
in the ones I've chosen.

00:52:16.930 --> 00:52:19.010
Here is what I've done.

00:52:19.010 --> 00:52:20.730
We avoided the layoffs.

00:52:20.730 --> 00:52:22.970
Avoided the layoffs.

00:52:22.970 --> 00:52:27.940
Then the other thing I did is,
I did just a SurveyMonkey

00:52:27.940 --> 00:52:31.710
thing a few weeks later, saying
OK, if we start to get

00:52:31.710 --> 00:52:36.140
better here financially, which
of the things would you like

00:52:36.140 --> 00:52:40.480
restored first, as it's
possible to do that?

00:52:40.480 --> 00:52:44.980
And I took the results of that
survey, and as the economy

00:52:44.980 --> 00:52:47.950
improved and our hospital got
better, I'd send out a note

00:52:47.950 --> 00:52:48.840
like four months later.

00:52:48.840 --> 00:52:53.120
Oh, things are better, we can
now restore the 401(k) match.

00:52:53.120 --> 00:52:53.800
Thanks very much.

00:52:53.800 --> 00:52:55.300
That was the first
on your list.

00:52:55.300 --> 00:52:57.480
Three months later, it'll
be the next thing.

00:52:57.480 --> 00:53:02.130
And after about eight months,
we were doing so much better

00:53:02.130 --> 00:53:07.820
that I actually give everybody
in the hospital a $500 bonus.

00:53:07.820 --> 00:53:09.220
So there's the situation.

00:53:09.220 --> 00:53:12.440
I mean, this was a high-stress
situation.

00:53:12.440 --> 00:53:15.230
When a hospital loses money,
it's not good.

00:53:15.230 --> 00:53:17.020
Because our only source
of money is

00:53:17.020 --> 00:53:19.290
what we actually earn.

00:53:19.290 --> 00:53:21.760
And I could've taken the
hierarchical approach.

00:53:21.760 --> 00:53:24.400
People would have accepted it.

00:53:24.400 --> 00:53:26.690
They would have said, well, he
has to do what he has to do.

00:53:26.690 --> 00:53:29.120
But think of what we
would have lost.

00:53:29.120 --> 00:53:32.860
First of all, 400 people
wouldn't have had jobs.

00:53:32.860 --> 00:53:36.520
Secondly, we would have lost
the opportunity to come

00:53:36.520 --> 00:53:38.580
together as a community--

00:53:38.580 --> 00:53:40.570
or as we said, as a family--

00:53:40.570 --> 00:53:45.590
to make this thing work, and
in essence, to take care of

00:53:45.590 --> 00:53:49.390
ourselves in the same way we
took care of patients.

00:53:49.390 --> 00:53:52.560
So it was a huge morale boost
for the organization.

00:53:52.560 --> 00:53:56.330
Plus because people had
participated in the selection

00:53:56.330 --> 00:53:59.160
process, they bought
into them.

00:53:59.160 --> 00:54:01.140
They said, well, this is
the right way to do it.

00:54:01.140 --> 00:54:05.920
Now around this time, I was
speaking to a president of a

00:54:05.920 --> 00:54:10.850
major university that was going
through a similar period

00:54:10.850 --> 00:54:14.620
and suggested to this person
that this university might

00:54:14.620 --> 00:54:17.010
adopt a similar approach.

00:54:17.010 --> 00:54:19.420
And the response of this
president was, well,

00:54:19.420 --> 00:54:20.880
participation is one thing.

00:54:20.880 --> 00:54:23.700
Pandemonium is another.

00:54:23.700 --> 00:54:25.000
That was the view.

00:54:25.000 --> 00:54:27.480
My own board chair said to me,
you know, I wouldn't have had

00:54:27.480 --> 00:54:29.790
the nerve to do what you did.

00:54:29.790 --> 00:54:34.080
And I said to him, Steve, why
does this take any nerve?

00:54:34.080 --> 00:54:36.700
I mean, I'm asking advice.

00:54:36.700 --> 00:54:39.120
I'm getting participation.

00:54:39.120 --> 00:54:42.660
I'm making the final decision,
but I'm engaging people.

00:54:42.660 --> 00:54:44.900
And by the way, many of them
will come up with ideas that I

00:54:44.900 --> 00:54:46.320
hadn't thought of.

00:54:46.320 --> 00:54:48.440
And he said, yeah, but I
wouldn't have had the nerve to

00:54:48.440 --> 00:54:51.970
do that my firm-- he was a
managing partner somewhere.

00:54:51.970 --> 00:54:54.940
It would have felt like
losing control.

00:54:54.940 --> 00:54:58.060
And I said, well, any feeling
that you have control is a

00:54:58.060 --> 00:54:59.520
mirage to start with.

00:54:59.520 --> 00:55:00.500
You don't.

00:55:00.500 --> 00:55:02.110
No one controls this place.

00:55:02.110 --> 00:55:06.420
I know the founders of this
organization might feel that

00:55:06.420 --> 00:55:07.300
way, from time to time.

00:55:07.300 --> 00:55:09.580
But they would admit privately,
I think, that they

00:55:09.580 --> 00:55:10.410
don't have control, either.

00:55:10.410 --> 00:55:12.702
What do you have, 60,000
people now?

00:55:15.540 --> 00:55:16.860
Something like that?

00:55:16.860 --> 00:55:18.290
No one controls this place.

00:55:18.290 --> 00:55:19.210
No, no.

00:55:19.210 --> 00:55:20.490
You know that.

00:55:20.490 --> 00:55:24.050
No one even controls your own
division, even if you've got a

00:55:24.050 --> 00:55:27.490
pretty hierarchical kind
of management.

00:55:27.490 --> 00:55:28.100
No, no.

00:55:28.100 --> 00:55:30.380
You control what you
do every day.

00:55:30.380 --> 00:55:34.290
And what makes you good at what
you do institutionally is

00:55:34.290 --> 00:55:36.790
that you take on that
responsibility, you feel a

00:55:36.790 --> 00:55:40.570
sense of engagement, creativity,
and purpose, and

00:55:40.570 --> 00:55:45.670
you do stuff that helps to
satisfy the corporate mission.

00:55:45.670 --> 00:55:47.390
That's what we want
to have there.

00:55:47.390 --> 00:55:51.110
So I would say to you, when
in doubt, back off.

00:55:51.110 --> 00:55:53.040
Ask everybody what they think.

00:55:53.040 --> 00:55:56.090
The worst that happens
is they don't come up

00:55:56.090 --> 00:55:58.450
with any good ideas.

00:55:58.450 --> 00:55:59.450
But you've asked.

00:55:59.450 --> 00:56:01.310
The best that happens is they've
come up with great

00:56:01.310 --> 00:56:04.720
ideas, they're there to help you
implement them, you make

00:56:04.720 --> 00:56:08.582
them feel good, they
solve your problem.

00:56:08.582 --> 00:56:11.560
It's not bad.

00:56:11.560 --> 00:56:13.490
All right.

00:56:13.490 --> 00:56:15.460
Are we at the end of
our allotted time?

00:56:15.460 --> 00:56:16.380
CAT ALLMAN: Yeah.

00:56:16.380 --> 00:56:17.210
PAUL LEVY: Thank
you very much.

00:56:17.210 --> 00:56:17.740
It's a pleasure.

00:56:17.740 --> 00:56:22.670
Oh, let me just say, of course
I'm on Facebook, Twitter,

00:56:22.670 --> 00:56:24.140
LinkedIn, all those things.

00:56:24.140 --> 00:56:25.440
I have a wonderful blog.

00:56:25.440 --> 00:56:27.380
It used to be called "Running
a Hospital." It's now called

00:56:27.380 --> 00:56:29.130
"Not Running a Hospital."

00:56:29.130 --> 00:56:31.960
And I'd love to have
you be in touch in

00:56:31.960 --> 00:56:33.460
any way in the future.

00:56:33.460 --> 00:56:35.060
And for those of you who want
to hang around for a few

00:56:35.060 --> 00:56:36.470
minutes, I'm happy to
sign your book.

00:56:36.470 --> 00:56:37.590
Thank you for having me.

00:56:37.590 --> 00:56:38.190
Thank you.

00:56:38.190 --> 00:56:41.430
