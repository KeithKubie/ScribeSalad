00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:10.820
...Zero and  lift off, the space shuttle Atlantis...

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:14.420
Weightlessness comes on really quickly during

00:00:14.420 --> 00:00:18.520
a space launch, or rather should I say as
soon as a space launch stops.

00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:23.109
The rocket is accelerating and you might
go up to 1 1/2 G, then back down to 1/2 G,

00:00:23.109 --> 00:00:28.569
then you might go up to 2 1/2 G for a bit
and then it drops back down a bit as the stage is jettisoned,

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:34.449
and then you will go up to
3 1/2 G on Soyuz where you maximise and then

00:00:34.449 --> 00:00:37.500
suddenly: Bang! The final rocket stage is
gone.

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:40.269
You go instantly from hyper G to zero G

00:00:40.269 --> 00:00:46.302
and all of a sudden you weigh nothing. That is
an incredibly powerful feeling you get,

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:51.650
the fluid immediately starts to redistribute and
move towards your chest and head

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:54.160
No longer was I being pushed back into my seat,

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:59.000
no longer was I even sitting down but
I was very much aware that I was floating

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:05.030
somewhere between the straps that were still tying
me to my seat and I forgot what it feels like

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:07.550
to actually sit down.

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:21.300
We are aware of the vulnerability of our crew.
We know the chance of losing our lives is

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:26.880
about 1 in a 100. We feel we have mastered
what we are doing, mastered the spaceship

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:34.499
which has evolved in our mind as an extension
of our own bodies. Any time there is a problem,

00:01:34.499 --> 00:01:40.299
our first idea is to find a solution. When
we get close to launch, we are like Superman as a crew.

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:46.460
They can invent any scenario they
want, however complex, we will survive and succeed.

00:01:58.940 --> 00:02:06.460
Weightlessness is 75% fantastic and 25% a
pain in the butt. The 25% has to do with

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:13.959
keeping your stuff where you want it. Here's an example:
eating dinner. You end up eating everything

00:02:13.959 --> 00:02:20.840
sequentially. You open up your steak tips
and you cut it open then you eat the whole thing.

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:25.480
Then you wrap it up and you put it in the garbage
can. Then you go and get your package of green

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:31.030
beans and you open that up and you eat the
whole thing because its just a hassle to have

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:36.390
to put it down, secure it and go to the next
thing and pull it up. That just becomes a

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:39.320
lot of overhead and you have to think about
it all the time.

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:44.340
Sleeping in space is not easy the first time

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:48.290
on the first day of any mission because you
are excited. You think about what your going

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:55.230
to do and don't let the brain relax and think
about the extraordinary adventures you are

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:58.750
living through. But it's funny because when
you are falling asleep and during the transition

00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:05.600
when you close your eyes you have this sensation
of floating. Which is strange as you don't

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:11.180
feel your body pressing on a mattress like
at home. Its strange, where is my mattress?

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:16.230
Just for fun I used to sleep on the ceiling
facing down. Anything that is specific to

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:22.030
space that you cannot do on Earth I wanted
to do. Like sleeping on the ceiling,

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:29.010
to do a pee upside down, watch the Earth whilst
leaning on the cockpit's top window.

00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:34.540
Its quite tricky to make yourself stay in

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:39.650
a particular place in the space station because
as soon as you touch one of the walls in order

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:43.880
to make yourself move in that particular part
you just carry on moving until you touch another

00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:49.830
wall. So you have to perhaps hold two 
ropes on either side and let go simultaneously

00:03:49.830 --> 00:03:54.950
and if your lucky you will let go with the
same force. You tend to move through the

00:03:54.950 --> 00:03:58.970
module as well as twisting round but its a
lovely sense of freedom.

00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:08.220
Being out in the space walk, in the space suit,

00:04:08.230 --> 00:04:12.590
is like being in space on steroids because
everything that makes space wonderful,

00:04:12.590 --> 00:04:17.750
zero gravity, being able to float, being able
to move big things and that incredible view

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:22.000
of the Earth. All of that is magnified, when
you get outside you are not looking out the

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:24.439
rim of a window, you are out there.

00:04:24.439 --> 00:04:29.449
The thrill, the rush if you will, of opening
the door for the first time and theres a bit

00:04:29.449 --> 00:04:33.270
of a sensation that your going to fall to
Earth, that your leaving this platform that

00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:36.520
is of course as weightless as you are anyway,
but you do not think about that, you think

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:40.439
you are on a stable platform and as you are
leaving that it's literally like stepping

00:04:40.439 --> 00:04:43.389
out of an aeroplane and you think you are
going to fall but of course you don't.

00:04:43.389 --> 00:04:46.020
There is space and Earth and space station

00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:51.289
wherever you look because of the bubble helmet
that we wear. Every space walk is different

00:04:51.289 --> 00:04:55.150
and you know they do not take space walks
lightly so when you are asked to go outside

00:04:55.150 --> 00:05:01.719
to do something a lot of thought has gone
into if it is worth the risk. So, as the astronauts

00:05:01.719 --> 00:05:07.370
outside doing the space walk, we are keenly
aware of how important our tasks are. So most

00:05:07.370 --> 00:05:14.890
of us are so focused on our task, its hard
to stop and appreciate what a cool experience that we are being given

00:05:16.060 --> 00:05:21.220
Believe it or not I think astronauts are more
afraid of screwing up than blowing up,

00:05:21.229 --> 00:05:27.680
our biggest stresses, tensions and fears come with that.
The scariest things we do are the things we

00:05:27.680 --> 00:05:32.540
train the most for so that makes us more task
focused.

00:05:32.540 --> 00:05:36.300
Having said that if you don't have a little bit of flutter when your doing these things

00:05:36.300 --> 00:05:38.340
you probably don't realise quite where you are.

00:05:43.020 --> 00:05:48.539
It only surprises me now when I think about
life back in space how easy it was because

00:05:48.539 --> 00:05:53.599
when your there you just do it. You don't
have to think about it and its just a joy

00:05:53.599 --> 00:05:56.099
the whole time.

00:05:56.099 --> 00:06:01.509
I have a large family and we are very close
but after 6 1/2 months in my first space flight

00:06:01.509 --> 00:06:07.249
I didn't want to come home. Its so amazing
up there, you're discovering new things,

00:06:07.249 --> 00:06:13.430
your seeing your planet, your floating, your like
superman. Its kind of addictive in a way but

00:06:13.430 --> 00:06:17.370
you get past that and your always glad to
be home and see your family, but I remember

00:06:17.370 --> 00:06:23.610
thinking as great as it is to be home, part
of me wishes I was still up there.
