00:00:01.667 --> 00:00:03.002
[buzzer alarms]

00:00:03.035 --> 00:00:04.437
(Forrest voice-over)
Unlike most pillow fights,

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:06.239
this one would have to
take place in a County jail

00:00:06.272 --> 00:00:08.641
where I was awaiting trial
for murder.

00:00:08.674 --> 00:00:11.177
I requested a meeting
with the prison psychiatrist.

00:00:11.210 --> 00:00:12.712 align:end position:100%
You wanted to see me
for something?

00:00:12.745 --> 00:00:14.680 align:start position:0%
Yes, I think I have
figured out a way

00:00:14.713 --> 00:00:18.551 align:start position:0%
to reform
the chronically violent.

00:00:18.584 --> 00:00:20.553 align:start position:0%
I want to organize
a pillow fight.

00:00:20.586 --> 00:00:22.055 align:start position:0%
And I know
that sounds crazy,

00:00:22.088 --> 00:00:24.357 align:start position:0%
but the idea is that
it could divert

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:27.894 align:start position:0%
everyone's aggressive
feelings into harmless fun.

00:00:27.927 --> 00:00:29.362 align:start position:0%
So what do you say?

00:00:30.563 --> 00:00:32.732 align:start size:63% position:38%
May be worth a shot.

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:36.402
Is that a yes?

00:00:36.435 --> 00:00:39.238
(Forrest voice-over)
Apparently that was a yes
because later that day

00:00:39.271 --> 00:00:40.973
a guards versus prisoners

00:00:41.006 --> 00:00:43.309
pillow fight
received official approval.

00:00:43.342 --> 00:00:45.478
Did you see that? We're gonna
have a pillow fight on Tuesday.

00:00:45.511 --> 00:00:47.413
You are all
cordially invited

00:00:47.446 --> 00:00:51.117
to a prisoners versus guards
pillow fight.

00:00:51.150 --> 00:00:53.319 align:start position:0%
It's gonna be
a little bit fun.

00:00:53.352 --> 00:00:55.054
[laughs]
I'm pretty sure.

00:00:55.087 --> 00:00:57.590
(Forrest voice-over)
The life of an accused murderer
behind bars

00:00:57.623 --> 00:00:59.592
is a lonely
and frightening one.

00:00:59.625 --> 00:01:01.961
This pillow fight seemed like
a good opportunity

00:01:01.994 --> 00:01:04.263
to get to know people
and to take my mind

00:01:04.296 --> 00:01:06.933
off of the terrible guilt
that was consuming me.

00:01:06.966 --> 00:01:08.801
This pillow fight
was MacNeil's suggestion,

00:01:08.834 --> 00:01:10.169
so let's all thank him
for coming up with

00:01:10.202 --> 00:01:11.337
a new activity
for you all.

00:01:11.370 --> 00:01:13.106
[applause]
- It's my pleasure.

00:01:13.139 --> 00:01:14.907 align:end position:100%
All right, MacNeil,
this is your baby.

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:17.243
- You wanna start us off?
- Well, I mean, listen,

00:01:17.276 --> 00:01:18.578
the great thing
about a pillow fight

00:01:18.611 --> 00:01:20.646
is the simplicity of it.
My question for you is:

00:01:20.679 --> 00:01:23.149
"Hey, who is ready to
feel like a kid again?"

00:01:23.182 --> 00:01:24.951
[laughs]
Okay.

00:01:24.984 --> 00:01:26.853
The other thing that I want
to tell you about pillow fights,

00:01:26.886 --> 00:01:29.122
just so you're aware,

00:01:29.155 --> 00:01:30.957
is that in a pillow fight,
you never know

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:33.960
when you might get
a sneak-attack.

00:01:33.993 --> 00:01:36.696 align:start position:0%
[laughs]
I surprised you, right?

00:01:36.729 --> 00:01:38.364 align:start position:0%
See that?
Okay...

00:01:38.397 --> 00:01:39.866
Well, come on, now.
Oh, ay, ay, ay, ay.

00:01:39.899 --> 00:01:41.834
Let's all join in.
All right?

00:01:41.867 --> 00:01:43.903
Let's have a pillow fight!

00:01:43.936 --> 00:01:46.639
[laughs]

00:01:46.672 --> 00:01:48.541
- [grunts]
- Oh, [bleep]!

00:01:48.574 --> 00:01:50.776
- [groans]
- Hey, hey, hey!

00:01:50.809 --> 00:01:53.613
[grunting, groaning]

00:01:53.646 --> 00:01:55.148
They're [bleep]ing weighted!

00:01:55.181 --> 00:01:57.083
(Forrest voice-over)
I had not considered that

00:01:57.116 --> 00:02:00.086
while these men may have been
novices at pillow fighting...

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:01.487
(Forrest)
Where did the weights
come from?

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:02.922
(Forrest voice-over)
They had expertise at smuggling

00:02:02.955 --> 00:02:05.057
items into places
they did not belong.

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:06.392 align:start size:53% position:47%
Stop it! Stop it!

00:02:06.425 --> 00:02:07.493
(Forrest voice-over)
Places like prisons...

00:02:07.526 --> 00:02:09.529
and pillowcases.

00:02:09.562 --> 00:02:12.231
The resulting melee
was a terrifying horror

00:02:12.264 --> 00:02:14.600
- to behold.
- You set us up, MacNeil!

00:02:14.633 --> 00:02:16.269
- What? I didn't do anything!
- Oh, you did!

00:02:16.302 --> 00:02:18.004 align:start size:28% position:72%
[screams]

00:02:18.037 --> 00:02:20.306
- [electricity crackles]
- [screams]

00:02:20.339 --> 00:02:23.276
[police siren blaring]

00:02:27.046 --> 00:02:28.948 align:start position:0%
Was it darkness
within the hearts

00:02:28.981 --> 00:02:30.750 align:start position:0%
of the pillow fighters
that turned innocent

00:02:30.783 --> 00:02:33.152 align:start position:0%
sleeping equipment
into improvised...

00:02:33.185 --> 00:02:36.789 align:start position:0%
deadly weapons?

00:02:36.822 --> 00:02:40.259 align:start position:0%
Or is pillow fighting
a twisted bloodsport

00:02:40.292 --> 00:02:42.728 align:start position:0%
in disguise,
a feather-stuffed form

00:02:42.761 --> 00:02:45.965 align:start position:0%
of combat that inspires
brutality in otherwise

00:02:45.998 --> 00:02:47.433 align:start position:0%
gentle creatures?

00:02:47.466 --> 00:02:48.868
No way to know for sure.

00:02:48.901 --> 00:02:51.704
What I do know is that
my dreams of world peace

00:02:51.737 --> 00:02:55.708
and my nose were shattered
together in one fell swoop.

00:02:55.741 --> 00:02:58.945 align:start position:0%
And, so, I am forced
to give pillow-fighting...

00:02:58.978 --> 00:03:02.315
just one--oh, sorry.

00:03:02.348 --> 00:03:03.983
I want to get
the plies together.

00:03:05.384 --> 00:03:06.352 align:start position:0%
Toilet paper.

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:09.320
- One star.
- Zing.
