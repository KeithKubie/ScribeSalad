00:00:00.570 --> 00:00:02.320
- [Instructor] Before talking
more about inequality,

00:00:02.320 --> 00:00:05.860
I think it's worth talking
about the difference of what,

00:00:05.860 --> 00:00:07.140
the difference between

00:00:09.005 --> 00:00:12.460
wealth and income.

00:00:12.460 --> 00:00:15.630
Wealth and income, because I
think they often get confused

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:18.750
in conversations about,
well, wealth and income

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:20.950
and also about inequality.

00:00:20.950 --> 00:00:23.280
As you can imagine, these
two things move together.

00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:24.840
You tend to associate someone

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:27.720
who has more wealth has a higher income,

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:29.880
or someone who has a higher income

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:32.760
is more likely to have more wealth.

00:00:32.760 --> 00:00:35.380
But these are not the same things.

00:00:35.380 --> 00:00:36.420
Wealth,

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:37.780
wealth is,

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:41.270
you could view it as the capital
or the assets that you own.

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:43.360
So this is the value,

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:45.763
value of capital,

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:49.390
capital and assets

00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:50.940
that you own,

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:53.710
capital and assets that are owned,

00:00:53.710 --> 00:00:58.110
while this is how much is made
in a certain period of time,

00:00:58.110 --> 00:01:00.080
so amount,

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:02.280
amount made

00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:05.993
in a certain,

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:09.450
certain period.

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:12.890
And they tend to move
together but not always.

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:15.870
So let's take an example where
they don't move together.

00:01:15.870 --> 00:01:17.650
So let's say that there's a retiree.

00:01:17.650 --> 00:01:19.870
A retiree might have a lot of wealth

00:01:19.870 --> 00:01:23.480
because they've had a whole
lifetime of income to save.

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:26.790
So let's say that your grandparents,

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:27.640
or let's just say

00:01:29.533 --> 00:01:30.866
your grandfather

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:34.160
has a wealth,

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:37.050
so the total assets, his total assets,

00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:39.460
let's say he has a million dollars,

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:42.030
a million dollars in total assets.

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:44.520
But he's not working
anymore, he's retired,

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:46.320
so his total income,

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:48.760
his total income is the return

00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:50.900
that he gets on that one million dollars.

00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:53.340
And let's say that he has invested it

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:57.640
in reasonably safe things and
some bonds and whatever else.

00:01:57.640 --> 00:01:59.170
And so he's getting a,

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:01.840
let's say he's getting a 3% return

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:04.200
after taxes on his wealth,

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:09.200
so his income is going
to be $30,000 per year.

00:02:09.760 --> 00:02:11.460
Now let's say you,

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:14.673
let's say this is you over here,

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:16.623
let's say you,

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:19.470
maybe you're just out of college,

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:22.580
maybe you actually have more
debt than you have assets.

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:26.020
So maybe your wealth could
even be, your wealth if you,

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:28.460
if, you know, let's say
you have a $20,000-car,

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:32.750
but you owe $40,000
for your college loans,

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:34.500
you might have negative wealth.

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:35.333
You might have

00:02:37.773 --> 00:02:40.800
a wealth of negative $20,000,

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:43.990
but you've, that
education was to good use,

00:02:43.990 --> 00:02:46.820
you were able to get a really good job,

00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:48.820
and you are now making,

00:02:48.820 --> 00:02:52.090
let's say you're making $80,000 a year.

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:54.570
So this is a situation
where the younger person,

00:02:54.570 --> 00:02:57.630
they actually have more
liabilities than they have assets,

00:02:57.630 --> 00:02:59.200
could even have negative wealth,

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:01.220
but has a reasonably high income,

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:02.880
while someone who's older and retired

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:06.670
could have a lot of
wealth but a lower income.

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:08.810
Now, as you can imagine, this is a,

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:11.410
you know, this is kind of,
I've drawn two extremes here

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:13.770
between a younger person
making a good amount of money,

00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:14.900
but they have some debt,

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:17.830
and an older person who's
just living on the returns

00:03:19.717 --> 00:03:23.300
from their cumulated
wealth over their lifetime.

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:24.600
Now, as you could imagine,

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:27.970
these two things do start to correlate,

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:30.340
especially, for example, let's
say wealth got really big.

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:31.980
Let's say instead of your grandfather

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:34.590
saving one million over his lifetime,

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:36.990
let's say it was 10 million,

00:03:36.990 --> 00:03:38.910
Let's say it's 10 million.

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:41.390
And he's investing it
in the exact same way,

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:43.940
so now that 3% of 10 million,

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:46.770
he has $300,000

00:03:46.770 --> 00:03:49.820
per year to live off of.

00:03:49.820 --> 00:03:52.800
So obviously, as wealth grows,

00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:54.700
the income from wealth,

00:03:54.700 --> 00:03:57.150
the income from that capital will grow.

00:03:57.150 --> 00:03:59.800
And at some point, that
income could be larger

00:03:59.800 --> 00:04:03.760
than what you might be able
to make purely from labor.

00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:05.650
But the whole point of this video is

00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:07.450
to at least highlight the difference.

00:04:07.450 --> 00:04:11.870
Sometimes when people talk
about inequality or disparities,

00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:13.830
they'll talk about accumulating wealth

00:04:14.772 --> 00:04:16.480
in a segment of the population,

00:04:16.480 --> 00:04:19.170
while other times they will
talk about accumulating,

00:04:19.170 --> 00:04:23.930
the national income going more
and more towards the top 1%

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:26.700
or top 10% or the top
quartile or whatever.

00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:28.710
And they often move together,

00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:31.313
but it's important to
realize the difference.
