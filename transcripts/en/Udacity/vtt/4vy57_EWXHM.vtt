00:00:00.580 --> 00:00:02.969
Users of a system want the cake and

00:00:02.969 --> 00:00:06.400
to eat it too. They want good performance from

00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:08.980
the operating system, but they also want the

00:00:08.980 --> 00:00:12.050
operating system to be robust and recover from such

00:00:12.050 --> 00:00:14.950
failures. That is, they want the operating system

00:00:14.950 --> 00:00:19.560
to be reliable. Conventional wisdom is that performance and

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:22.920
reliability are opposing concerns. That is, you can

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:26.364
have one or the other, but not both. Quick

00:00:26.364 --> 00:00:29.060
Silver's approach is that if recovery is taken

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:32.210
seriously from the get-go, you can design the

00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:35.380
system to be robust to failures without losing

00:00:35.380 --> 00:00:38.490
much on performance. Let's have another trivia quiz.
