00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:18.960
it's really rewarding to put in the work
and practice every day and then when you

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:20.640
go to a really big competition

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:25.860
just to see how much you improve and all
the progress you make

00:00:25.860 --> 00:00:30.180
a really good friend of mine convinced me to do cross
country and I stuck with it and during

00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:35.039
spring you go to track and I figured you
know why not? Running the 400 hurdles is

00:00:35.039 --> 00:00:41.190
very rhythmic. It used to feel sort of
smooth and easy in the beginning and

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:44.940
then hard at the end but now it's all
starting to feel the same speed

00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:04.260
it's really really awesome going to the
Olympic Trials not only representing

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:09.510
Harvard but also with my teammates just
because it's really nice to be able to

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:14.760
wear that H. Reaching for the Olympics is
definitely my riskiest goal so far

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:19.860
I kind of came to the realization like,
whoa, I'm on the road to Rio, like i am

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:23.240
I'm actually trying to do this

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:27.229
taking a step back and kind of looking
at what I've been doing

00:01:27.229 --> 00:01:30.610
how far I've come it's happening really
fast but it's a lot of fun

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:34.100
that's what I like about it, you know,
discovering new things about myself

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:39.350
Harvard has helped me get to this
point because it really fosters this

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:44.180
hard-working person that I've become. Everything that I do is not fifty percent

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:47.360
in the classroom, you have
to give everything one hundred percent

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:50.360
at the track you definitely have to give a hundred percent

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:56.950
going to the trials is a great
experience for athletes even if they

00:01:56.950 --> 00:02:00.280
don't hit the Olympic standard just
because it's really great competition

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:03.640
really high energy high caliber high
stakes

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:06.759
we have a pretty competitive US team

00:02:06.759 --> 00:02:11.709
so just to be able to even compete for a
spot on that is such a privilege and an

00:02:11.709 --> 00:02:14.550
honor to be able to represent the u.s.

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:16.870
at the Olympics would be really special

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:22.930
it would be amazing to wear your country
on your chest and represent your country
