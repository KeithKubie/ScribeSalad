00:00:01.200 --> 00:00:02.568
 (faucet water running)
 (glass slams on table)

00:00:02.601 --> 00:00:04.337
 (purse smacks on bar stool)
 (female claps hands)

00:00:04.370 --> 00:00:05.605 line:92%
- Hello.

00:00:05.638 --> 00:00:07.040
I'm wondering if I could
trouble you for a drink.

00:00:07.073 --> 00:00:10.176
 I should have a tab open
 under the name Annette Bening.

00:00:10.209 --> 00:00:13.046
 Craving something
 with a little kick.

00:00:13.079 --> 00:00:14.213 line:92%
Do you do these?

00:00:14.246 --> 00:00:17.050 line:92%
 JalapeÃ±o margarita.

00:00:17.083 --> 00:00:18.217
  - Yeah.
  - Salt on the rim.

00:00:18.250 --> 00:00:19.719 line:92%
 Little sprinkle of cayenne?

00:00:19.752 --> 00:00:22.021
 Do you do fresh lime?
 - Actually, yeah.

00:00:22.054 --> 00:00:22.955 line:92%
- Bottled lime?

00:00:22.988 --> 00:00:24.590 line:92%
 Roses? I'm cool with anything.

00:00:24.623 --> 00:00:25.858 line:92%
But, I just should know

00:00:25.891 --> 00:00:27.460
 'cause they're gonna
 pumping extra sugar

00:00:27.493 --> 00:00:29.328 line:92%
into those bottled lime juices,

00:00:29.361 --> 00:00:30.830 line:92%
which you know is pretty gross.

00:00:30.863 --> 00:00:32.098
 You know, can you
 believe that actually?

00:00:32.131 --> 00:00:32.899
  (purse slams onto
  another bar stool)

00:00:32.932 --> 00:00:33.866 line:92%
The extra sugar?

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:35.168 line:92%
 I mean what's this FDA doing,

00:00:35.201 --> 00:00:36.402 line:92%
now that I'm thinking about it?

00:00:36.435 --> 00:00:41.174
Do you put red chile
flake in the margarita?

00:00:41.207 --> 00:00:42.442 line:92%
It's dangerous.

00:00:42.475 --> 00:00:44.210 line:92%
  You can ask Billy Crudup.

00:00:44.243 --> 00:00:47.313
The sweetest, dearest
mouse you ever did meet.

00:00:47.346 --> 00:00:49.148 line:92%
He saw me nearly

00:00:49.181 --> 00:00:50.650 line:92%
 choke to death

00:00:50.683 --> 00:00:52.385
 at the 20th Century
 (mumbles) wrap party.

00:00:52.418 --> 00:00:53.553 line:92%
 Got lodged.

00:00:53.586 --> 00:00:55.455
 My uvula, my
 throat. Right there.

00:00:55.488 --> 00:00:56.722 line:92%
  Hacking, all week.

00:00:56.755 --> 00:00:59.325
Couldn't smoke. Just
that deep, the guttural,

00:00:59.358 --> 00:01:02.195
 - God.
 - that (gags).

00:01:02.228 --> 00:01:03.362 line:92%
 Can I vape in here?

00:01:03.395 --> 00:01:05.765
 This isn't an airport,
 I'm gonna vape.

00:01:05.798 --> 00:01:07.400
 - I'm sorry I
 actually need to, uh.

00:01:07.433 --> 00:01:08.901 line:92%
 - (gasps) Oh my god.

00:01:08.934 --> 00:01:12.038 line:92%
 (sucks on vaporizer)

00:01:14.006 --> 00:01:16.209 line:92%
 I (coughs) just remembered,

00:01:16.242 --> 00:01:17.877
  I have a voiceover
  spot this week.

00:01:17.910 --> 00:01:19.712
 Lets just cut all
 spice all together.

00:01:19.745 --> 00:01:20.947 line:92%
 And while we're here,

00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:22.782
 I must insist we use
 George's tequila.

00:01:22.815 --> 00:01:24.484 line:92%
 - I do not know who that is.

00:01:24.517 --> 00:01:26.018 line:92%
  - George Clooney.

00:01:26.051 --> 00:01:27.920
 He's a dear friend. And the
 tequila really is the best.

00:01:27.953 --> 00:01:28.754 line:92%
And I wouldn't say that.

00:01:28.787 --> 00:01:30.756 line:92%
 That is not who I am.

00:01:30.789 --> 00:01:33.493
  Actually, he's the one who
  taught me the difference

00:01:33.526 --> 00:01:35.695 line:92%
between gold and silver tequila.

00:01:35.728 --> 00:01:38.631 line:92%
 And, um, you're gonna kill me.

00:01:39.632 --> 00:01:40.900 line:92%
You're going to kill me.

00:01:40.933 --> 00:01:42.301 line:92%
 You will murder me.

00:01:42.334 --> 00:01:43.269 line:92%
 'Cause you know what?

00:01:43.302 --> 00:01:44.937 line:92%
 After all I've said and done.

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:46.773 line:92%
  What I really want

00:01:47.873 --> 00:01:48.808 line:92%
 Is.

00:01:48.841 --> 00:01:49.642 line:92%
  A.

00:01:49.675 --> 00:01:50.476 line:92%
Mojito.

00:01:50.509 --> 00:01:51.344 line:92%
- That's what you want?

00:01:51.377 --> 00:01:52.178
- Yup.
- Okay.

00:01:52.211 --> 00:01:54.747 line:92%
Yeah. And a hotdog, too.

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:55.748 line:92%
If you have it.

00:01:55.781 --> 00:01:56.583 line:92%
Please.

00:01:58.817 --> 00:02:00.253 line:92%
 (sucks on vaporizer loudly)

00:02:00.286 --> 00:02:01.020 line:92%
 - I.

00:02:03.088 --> 00:02:04.124 line:92%
 - That's really good.

00:02:05.391 --> 00:02:06.392 line:92%
Channing Tatum.
