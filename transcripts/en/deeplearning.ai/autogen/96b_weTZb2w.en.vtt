00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:02.240
 
one of the challenges of face

00:00:02.240 --> 00:00:02.250
one of the challenges of face
 

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:04.519
one of the challenges of face
recognition is that you need to solve

00:00:04.519 --> 00:00:04.529
recognition is that you need to solve
 

00:00:04.529 --> 00:00:07.249
recognition is that you need to solve
the one-shot learning problem what that

00:00:07.249 --> 00:00:07.259
the one-shot learning problem what that
 

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:08.990
the one-shot learning problem what that
means is that for most face recognition

00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:09.000
means is that for most face recognition
 

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.330
means is that for most face recognition
applications you need together recognize

00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:11.340
applications you need together recognize
 

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:14.209
applications you need together recognize
a person given just one single image or

00:00:14.209 --> 00:00:14.219
a person given just one single image or
 

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:16.849
a person given just one single image or
given just one example of that person's

00:00:16.849 --> 00:00:16.859
given just one example of that person's
 

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:19.460
given just one example of that person's
face and historically deep learning

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:19.470
face and historically deep learning
 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:21.590
face and historically deep learning
algorithms don't work well if you have

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:21.600
algorithms don't work well if you have
 

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:24.380
algorithms don't work well if you have
only one training example let's see an

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:24.390
only one training example let's see an
 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:26.450
only one training example let's see an
example of what this means and then talk

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:26.460
example of what this means and then talk
 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:29.419
example of what this means and then talk
about how to address this problem let's

00:00:29.419 --> 00:00:29.429
about how to address this problem let's
 

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:31.370
about how to address this problem let's
say you have a database of four pictures

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:31.380
say you have a database of four pictures
 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:34.400
say you have a database of four pictures
of employees in your organization these

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:34.410
of employees in your organization these
 

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:36.200
of employees in your organization these
are actually some of my colleagues at

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:36.210
are actually some of my colleagues at
 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:39.560
are actually some of my colleagues at
debugging AI K and a neo Eunice and Tien

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:39.570
debugging AI K and a neo Eunice and Tien
 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:42.709
debugging AI K and a neo Eunice and Tien
now let's say someone shows up at the

00:00:42.709 --> 00:00:42.719
now let's say someone shows up at the
 

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:44.569
now let's say someone shows up at the
office and they want to be led through

00:00:44.569 --> 00:00:44.579
office and they want to be led through
 

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:48.020
office and they want to be led through
the turnstile what the system has to do

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:48.030
the turnstile what the system has to do
 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:51.170
the turnstile what the system has to do
is despite ever having seen only one

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:51.180
is despite ever having seen only one
 

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:53.810
is despite ever having seen only one
image of Danielle to recognize that this

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:53.820
image of Danielle to recognize that this
 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:56.360
image of Danielle to recognize that this
is actually the same person and in

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:56.370
is actually the same person and in
 

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:58.729
is actually the same person and in
contrast if I see someone that's not in

00:00:58.729 --> 00:00:58.739
contrast if I see someone that's not in
 

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:00.920
contrast if I see someone that's not in
this database then they should recognize

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:00.930
this database then they should recognize
 

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:03.500
this database then they should recognize
that this is not any of the four persons

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:03.510
that this is not any of the four persons
 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:05.719
that this is not any of the four persons
in the database so the one-shot learning

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:05.729
in the database so the one-shot learning
 

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:08.149
in the database so the one-shot learning
problem you have to learn from just one

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:08.159
problem you have to learn from just one
 

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:11.149
problem you have to learn from just one
example to recognize the person again

00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:11.159
example to recognize the person again
 

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:13.160
example to recognize the person again
and you need this for most face

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:13.170
and you need this for most face
 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:15.469
and you need this for most face
recognition systems because you might

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:15.479
recognition systems because you might
 

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:18.230
recognition systems because you might
have only one picture of each of your

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:18.240
have only one picture of each of your
 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:20.510
have only one picture of each of your
employees or if your team members in

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:20.520
employees or if your team members in
 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:23.390
employees or if your team members in
your employee database so one approach

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:23.400
your employee database so one approach
 

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:26.630
your employee database so one approach
you could try is to input the image of

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:26.640
you could try is to input the image of
 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:29.510
you could try is to input the image of
the person feed it to a confident and

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:29.520
the person feed it to a confident and
 

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:33.740
the person feed it to a confident and
have it out put a label why using a soft

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:33.750
have it out put a label why using a soft
 

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:36.740
have it out put a label why using a soft
max unit with four outputs or maybe five

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:36.750
max unit with four outputs or maybe five
 

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:38.899
max unit with four outputs or maybe five
outputs corresponding to each of these

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:38.909
outputs corresponding to each of these
 

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:41.719
outputs corresponding to each of these
four persons or none of the above so

00:01:41.719 --> 00:01:41.729
four persons or none of the above so
 

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:43.460
four persons or none of the above so
that would be five outputs in the

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:43.470
that would be five outputs in the
 

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:44.090
that would be five outputs in the
softmax

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:44.100
softmax
 

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:45.920
softmax
but this really doesn't work well

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:45.930
but this really doesn't work well
 

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:47.840
but this really doesn't work well
because if you have such a small

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:47.850
because if you have such a small
 

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:50.480
because if you have such a small
training set is really not enough to

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:50.490
training set is really not enough to
 

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:53.389
training set is really not enough to
train a robust neural network for this

00:01:53.389 --> 00:01:53.399
train a robust neural network for this
 

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:56.330
train a robust neural network for this
task and also whatever new person joins

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:56.340
task and also whatever new person joins
 

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:59.630
task and also whatever new person joins
your team so now you have five persons

00:01:59.630 --> 00:01:59.640
your team so now you have five persons
 

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:01.310
your team so now you have five persons
you need to recognize so there should

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:01.320
you need to recognize so there should
 

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:03.950
you need to recognize so there should
now be six outputs do you have to

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:03.960
now be six outputs do you have to
 

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:06.200
now be six outputs do you have to
retrain the confident every time that

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:06.210
retrain the confident every time that
 

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:07.760
retrain the confident every time that
just doesn't seem like a good approach

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:07.770
just doesn't seem like a good approach
 

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:10.249
just doesn't seem like a good approach
so the carry outs face recognition

00:02:10.249 --> 00:02:10.259
so the carry outs face recognition
 

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:12.619
so the carry outs face recognition
to carry out one-shot learning so

00:02:12.619 --> 00:02:12.629
to carry out one-shot learning so
 

00:02:12.629 --> 00:02:14.509
to carry out one-shot learning so
instead to make this work

00:02:14.509 --> 00:02:14.519
instead to make this work
 

00:02:14.519 --> 00:02:15.619
instead to make this work
what you're going to do instead is

00:02:15.619 --> 00:02:15.629
what you're going to do instead is
 

00:02:15.629 --> 00:02:18.110
what you're going to do instead is
learning similarity function in

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:18.120
learning similarity function in
 

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:21.170
learning similarity function in
particular you want a neural network to

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:21.180
particular you want a neural network to
 

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:22.729
particular you want a neural network to
learn a function which is going to

00:02:22.729 --> 00:02:22.739
learn a function which is going to
 

00:02:22.739 --> 00:02:26.869
learn a function which is going to
denote D which inputs two images and it

00:02:26.869 --> 00:02:26.879
denote D which inputs two images and it
 

00:02:26.879 --> 00:02:29.210
denote D which inputs two images and it
outputs the degree of difference between

00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:29.220
outputs the degree of difference between
 

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:32.630
outputs the degree of difference between
the two images so if the two images are

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:32.640
the two images so if the two images are
 

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:35.449
the two images so if the two images are
of the same person you want to this to

00:02:35.449 --> 00:02:35.459
of the same person you want to this to
 

00:02:35.459 --> 00:02:38.780
of the same person you want to this to
output a small number and if the two

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:38.790
output a small number and if the two
 

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:40.910
output a small number and if the two
images are of two very different people

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:40.920
images are of two very different people
 

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:43.520
images are of two very different people
you wanted to output a large number

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:43.530
you wanted to output a large number
 

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:46.819
you wanted to output a large number
so during recognition time if the degree

00:02:46.819 --> 00:02:46.829
so during recognition time if the degree
 

00:02:46.829 --> 00:02:48.530
so during recognition time if the degree
of difference between them is less than

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:48.540
of difference between them is less than
 

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:52.190
of difference between them is less than
some threshold called tau which is a

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:52.200
some threshold called tau which is a
 

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:55.339
some threshold called tau which is a
parameter a hyper parameter then you

00:02:55.339 --> 00:02:55.349
parameter a hyper parameter then you
 

00:02:55.349 --> 00:02:57.349
parameter a hyper parameter then you
would predict that these two pictures

00:02:57.349 --> 00:02:57.359
would predict that these two pictures
 

00:02:57.359 --> 00:03:00.349
would predict that these two pictures
are of the same person and it is greater

00:03:00.349 --> 00:03:00.359
are of the same person and it is greater
 

00:03:00.359 --> 00:03:02.809
are of the same person and it is greater
than tau you would predict that these

00:03:02.809 --> 00:03:02.819
than tau you would predict that these
 

00:03:02.819 --> 00:03:07.759
than tau you would predict that these
are different persons and so this is how

00:03:07.759 --> 00:03:07.769
are different persons and so this is how
 

00:03:07.769 --> 00:03:10.520
are different persons and so this is how
you address the face verification

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:10.530
you address the face verification
 

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:14.720
you address the face verification
problem to use this for a recognition

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:14.730
problem to use this for a recognition
 

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:17.990
problem to use this for a recognition
task what you do is given this new

00:03:17.990 --> 00:03:18.000
task what you do is given this new
 

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:21.170
task what you do is given this new
picture you would use this function D to

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:21.180
picture you would use this function D to
 

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:23.659
picture you would use this function D to
compare these two images and maybe I'll

00:03:23.659 --> 00:03:23.669
compare these two images and maybe I'll
 

00:03:23.669 --> 00:03:26.780
compare these two images and maybe I'll
output a very large number let's say 10

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:26.790
output a very large number let's say 10
 

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:29.599
output a very large number let's say 10
for this example and then you compare

00:03:29.599 --> 00:03:29.609
for this example and then you compare
 

00:03:29.609 --> 00:03:31.640
for this example and then you compare
this with the second image in your

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:31.650
this with the second image in your
 

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:33.949
this with the second image in your
database and because these two are the

00:03:33.949 --> 00:03:33.959
database and because these two are the
 

00:03:33.959 --> 00:03:35.809
database and because these two are the
same person hopefully your output is a

00:03:35.809 --> 00:03:35.819
same person hopefully your output is a
 

00:03:35.819 --> 00:03:38.059
same person hopefully your output is a
very small number and then you do this

00:03:38.059 --> 00:03:38.069
very small number and then you do this
 

00:03:38.069 --> 00:03:40.099
very small number and then you do this
for the other images in your database

00:03:40.099 --> 00:03:40.109
for the other images in your database
 

00:03:40.109 --> 00:03:44.390
for the other images in your database
and so on and based on this you will

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:44.400
and so on and based on this you will
 

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:47.960
and so on and based on this you will
figure out that this is actually that

00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:47.970
figure out that this is actually that
 

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:50.300
figure out that this is actually that
person which is a danielle and in

00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:50.310
person which is a danielle and in
 

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:52.039
person which is a danielle and in
contrast is someone not in your database

00:03:52.039 --> 00:03:52.049
contrast is someone not in your database
 

00:03:52.049 --> 00:03:55.220
contrast is someone not in your database
shows up as you use the function D to

00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:55.230
shows up as you use the function D to
 

00:03:55.230 --> 00:03:57.050
shows up as you use the function D to
make all of these pairwise comparisons

00:03:57.050 --> 00:03:57.060
make all of these pairwise comparisons
 

00:03:57.060 --> 00:03:59.629
make all of these pairwise comparisons
hopefully D will output a very large

00:03:59.629 --> 00:03:59.639
hopefully D will output a very large
 

00:03:59.639 --> 00:04:02.449
hopefully D will output a very large
number for all four pairwise comparisons

00:04:02.449 --> 00:04:02.459
number for all four pairwise comparisons
 

00:04:02.459 --> 00:04:05.149
number for all four pairwise comparisons
and then you say that this is not any

00:04:05.149 --> 00:04:05.159
and then you say that this is not any
 

00:04:05.159 --> 00:04:07.280
and then you say that this is not any
one of the four persons in the database

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:07.290
one of the four persons in the database
 

00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:09.740
one of the four persons in the database
notice how this allows you to solve the

00:04:09.740 --> 00:04:09.750
notice how this allows you to solve the
 

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:12.649
notice how this allows you to solve the
one-shot learning problem so long as you

00:04:12.649 --> 00:04:12.659
one-shot learning problem so long as you
 

00:04:12.659 --> 00:04:15.080
one-shot learning problem so long as you
can learn this function D which inputs a

00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:15.090
can learn this function D which inputs a
 

00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:17.659
can learn this function D which inputs a
pair of images and tells you basically

00:04:17.659 --> 00:04:17.669
pair of images and tells you basically
 

00:04:17.669 --> 00:04:18.970
pair of images and tells you basically
if they're the same

00:04:18.970 --> 00:04:18.980
if they're the same
 

00:04:18.980 --> 00:04:21.310
if they're the same
you know different persons then if you

00:04:21.310 --> 00:04:21.320
you know different persons then if you
 

00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:23.890
you know different persons then if you
have someone new join your team you can

00:04:23.890 --> 00:04:23.900
have someone new join your team you can
 

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:26.890
have someone new join your team you can
add a fifth person to your database and

00:04:26.890 --> 00:04:26.900
add a fifth person to your database and
 

00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:31.180
add a fifth person to your database and
it just works fine so you've seen how

00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:31.190
it just works fine so you've seen how
 

00:04:31.190 --> 00:04:34.090
it just works fine so you've seen how
learning this function D which inputs to

00:04:34.090 --> 00:04:34.100
learning this function D which inputs to
 

00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:36.220
learning this function D which inputs to
images allows you to address the

00:04:36.220 --> 00:04:36.230
images allows you to address the
 

00:04:36.230 --> 00:04:38.470
images allows you to address the
one-shot learning problem in the next

00:04:38.470 --> 00:04:38.480
one-shot learning problem in the next
 

00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:40.900
one-shot learning problem in the next
video let's take a look at how you can

00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:40.910
video let's take a look at how you can
 

00:04:40.910 --> 00:04:43.420
video let's take a look at how you can
actually train in your network to learn

00:04:43.420 --> 00:04:43.430
actually train in your network to learn
 

00:04:43.430 --> 00:04:46.570
actually train in your network to learn
this function D
