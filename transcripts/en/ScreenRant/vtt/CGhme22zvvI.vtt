00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:08.109
Who says a video game has to actually work
to be unforgettable?

00:00:08.109 --> 00:00:11.230
No matter how many hours developers spend
making a game as polished as possible, some

00:00:11.230 --> 00:00:13.379
technical bugs are bound to make it through.

00:00:13.379 --> 00:00:18.450
Newer games, like the PC version of Arkham
Knight, may take those glitches to a new level,

00:00:18.450 --> 00:00:21.980
but sometimes, the most unbelievable errors
can be found in the games of yesterday.

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:25.320
Make sure to let us know in the comments below
if we missed any big ones!

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:28.100
Here are Screen Rant’s 10 Worst Video Game
Glitches.

00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:29.840
Dragon’s Dogma

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:33.410
These days, no triple-A role playing game
is complete without the chance to romance

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:35.030
an in-game character.

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:37.550
But not all games deal with love the way you
would think.

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:41.910
The RPG Dragon’s Dogma let players choose
who would be their romantic target, only to

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:44.400
see them taken hostage before the final battle.

00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:48.780
What players didn’t know was that no matter
how many hours spent chatting up a local barmaid,

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:51.650
the game just chose a romance based on time
spent in conversation.

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:55.250
Players were stunned when the final battle
saw a general store owner, blacksmith, or

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:59.380
even court jester revealed as their true love
– the love scene that followed made this

00:00:59.380 --> 00:01:01.270
mistake one for the ages.

00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:03.520
Assassin’s Creed Unity

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:09.010
No next-gen game is without some flaws, but
AC Unity’s mistakes ranged from tiny to

00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:10.010
game-breaking.

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:19.470
Players could laugh when enraged NPCs stumbled
into dramatic cut scenes, but the most widespread

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:22.790
glitch had to do with character’s faces…
or the lack of them.

00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:26.270
It eventually became a famous online joke
among players, but no player will forget the

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:30.500
first time they witnessed the real horrors
of the digital French Revolution.

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:31.740
Red Dead Redemption

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:36.060
As open worlds get bigger and bigger, the
unpredictable mistakes become more and more

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:37.060
frequent.

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:40.600
For Rockstar Games western mega-hit, the most
unforgettable glitch occurred when, an animal

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:44.760
in the world wouldn’t be rendered with its
own skin, but appear with a human model grafted

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:45.760
onto it.

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:48.800
The result was donkey women that could be
ridden through the countryside, human beings

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:52.750
flying like birds, and our personal favorite,
the hilarious but deadly man-cougar.

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:57.240
They’re freakish, but Red Dead’s “Manimals”
are the kind of glitch we can live with.

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:58.240
Call of Duty

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:01.950
In the world of Call of Duty multiplayer,
anything that CAN happen, WILL happen.

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:06.130
But players of Modern Warfare 3 were confused
to realize that if a flag carrier in an online

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:10.420
match managed to kill an opposing player,
they would respawn without their head.

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:14.040
That was a funny enough glitch, but the other
soldiers clearly disagreed.

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:17.730
Apparently the horror of the headless soldier
was too much for his teammates to handle:

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:21.200
ANY player who witnessed him without a head
was booted from the game.

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:24.580
Not all battle scars are physical.

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:25.900
Madden NFL 15

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:31.060
Sports simulations pride themselves on recreating
a game down to blades of grass, but somehow,

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:35.050
Christian Kirksey, the rookie linebacker for
the Cleveland Browns was too much to handle.

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:40.459
For some reason, the 6’2”, 235-pound player
was rendered just shy of a foot tall in one

00:02:40.459 --> 00:02:42.090
of the game’s online challenge.

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:46.190
Rather than fix the bug, the developers embraced
the tale of the Tiny Titan, and so did Kirksey.

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:49.700
The glitch was taken with a sense of humor,
probably due to the fact that despite his

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:55.280
size, the Tiny Titan still had the hitting
power of his real-life counterpart.

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:56.280
Minecraft

00:02:56.280 --> 00:03:01.060
No video game has skyrocketed to global popularity
like Minecraft, where players build entire

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:04.350
empires on randomly-generated and populated
online servers.

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:08.250
But as simple as the cube-based game may be,
thing start to get a bit… weird when you

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:09.740
head to the game world’s borders.

00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:13.340
Early players who headed for the edges of
the game’s map – now known as the Far

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:18.480
Lands – soon saw reality itself start to
break, as layers of Earth hovered in the air,

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:22.519
constantly, flowing sand from the sky made
frame rates drop to game-breaking levels,

00:03:22.519 --> 00:03:25.830
and every step risked dropping players into
the black Void below.

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:29.620
There’s never been an Inception game, but
Minecraft’s outer limits come pretty darn

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:31.709
close.

00:03:31.709 --> 00:03:32.709
Battlefield 3

00:03:32.709 --> 00:03:36.930
EA claimed it had a true rival for Call of
Duty when it began to roll out Battlefield

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:39.220
3 for beta testers around the world.

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:42.970
But it wasn’t the graphics, the physics,
or even the game modes that captured the spotlight.

00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:46.099
It was a strange glitch that occurred when
players crawled.

00:03:46.099 --> 00:03:50.599
One second they were deadly soldiers, the
next, they were long-necked, grotesquely proportioned

00:03:50.599 --> 00:03:51.599
human worms.

00:03:51.599 --> 00:03:54.730
The developers eventually patched out the
bug in the animation, but as far as we’re

00:03:54.730 --> 00:03:57.569
concerned they should have probably left it
in.

00:03:57.569 --> 00:03:58.569
Destiny

00:03:58.569 --> 00:04:01.989
The developers of this stellar online shooter
may have put hours into the lore behind the

00:04:01.989 --> 00:04:05.130
game’s races and Guardians, but players
had other priorities.

00:04:05.130 --> 00:04:09.159
Able to make their characters dance, and ride
their Sparrow hover vehicles across the game’s

00:04:09.159 --> 00:04:13.080
maps, it was only a matter of time before
the two were combined into one ridiculous

00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:14.080
time-killer.

00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:17.660
“Sparrow surfing” was every troll’s
dream, but honestly, who would care about

00:04:17.660 --> 00:04:21.859
saving humanity from the brink, or taking
on epic Raids when there are enemies on Mars

00:04:21.859 --> 00:04:24.550
who haven’t seen a Guardian bust a move
at 50 miles an hour?

00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:27.379
We’re surprised the game survived at all.

00:04:27.379 --> 00:04:28.419
Grand Theft Auto 5

00:04:28.419 --> 00:04:30.909
In game design, ever perk comes at a price.

00:04:30.909 --> 00:04:35.669
In the case of GTA5, that meant the decision
to keep every cut-scene playing in real time,

00:04:35.669 --> 00:04:38.090
in the real, active game world had a surprise
hitch.

00:04:38.090 --> 00:04:41.430
If players triggered a cut-scene while the
police were on their tail, the cops didn’t

00:04:41.430 --> 00:04:43.029
back off until their scene was over.

00:04:43.029 --> 00:04:46.449
Players watched through tears of laughter
as intense scenes played out as cops fired

00:04:46.449 --> 00:04:48.869
round after round into the on-screen figures.

00:04:48.869 --> 00:04:52.409
Where glitches like these can break the tone
of serious games, it all fit inside the madness

00:04:52.409 --> 00:04:57.569
of Grand Theft Auto, becoming a glitch to
hope for, not one to avoid.

00:04:57.569 --> 00:04:59.969
N64 Cartridge Tilting

00:04:59.969 --> 00:05:03.999
Modern glitches may have complicated routines
and AI to blame, but in the days of the Nintendo

00:05:03.999 --> 00:05:08.629
64, just tilting the game cartridge was enough
to create some instant glitch entertainment.

00:05:08.629 --> 00:05:12.940
By misaligning the pins with those of the
system, entire games became hellish nightmares.

00:05:12.940 --> 00:05:15.509
GoldenEye turned people into writhing masses
of limbs.

00:05:15.509 --> 00:05:18.990
Mario 64 became a limbless jumper set to the
sounds of limbo.

00:05:18.990 --> 00:05:21.280
But the Legend of Zelda was the worst.

00:05:21.280 --> 00:05:27.009
Forget glitches – the game began to scream
in terror, before a black screen revealed

00:05:27.009 --> 00:05:29.819
messages of “I love you” hidden between
lines of code.

00:05:29.819 --> 00:05:32.580
We’ll take broken physics over these nightmares
any day.

00:05:32.580 --> 00:05:34.889
