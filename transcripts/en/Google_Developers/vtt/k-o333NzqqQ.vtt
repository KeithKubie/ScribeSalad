00:00:03.490 --> 00:00:04.510
DAN GALPIN: All right.

00:00:04.510 --> 00:00:06.218
I'd like to thank you
all for being here.

00:00:06.218 --> 00:00:08.200
We are going to be
talking about games.

00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:10.580
And we have a tremendous
group of panelists up here.

00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:12.760
But before I introduce
them, I wanted

00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:14.620
to go a little bit into
what we're actually

00:00:14.620 --> 00:00:16.079
going to be talking about.

00:00:16.079 --> 00:00:19.290
And specifically, we talked
about games a little bit

00:00:19.290 --> 00:00:20.504
in the keynote.

00:00:20.504 --> 00:00:21.920
And one of the
things we mentioned

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:25.120
is that three out of every
four Android users play games.

00:00:25.120 --> 00:00:27.450
So this is a huge community.

00:00:27.450 --> 00:00:29.240
The last time we even
announced numbers,

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:31.830
we had over a billion
Android activations.

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:36.780
And our Play games services
have had a 100 million new users

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:38.240
in six months.

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:42.760
And some people say that is the
fastest growing network ever.

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:46.040
I just think it's
a lot of users.

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:48.230
And what does it
actually contain?

00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:50.920
So we're talking about
Achievements, Leaderboards,

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:54.980
Multiplayer, and Game Gifts,
plus the two new services

00:00:54.980 --> 00:01:00.200
we announced here at I/O, which
are Saved Games and Quests.

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:01.990
And I hope you all come.

00:01:01.990 --> 00:01:03.776
There's another session
right after this,

00:01:03.776 --> 00:01:05.400
which if you're
watching this on video,

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:07.233
it's all going to be
on video as well, where

00:01:07.233 --> 00:01:10.380
Greg [? Cartell ?] goes
into a huge amount of detail

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:13.280
about what we're doing and our
motivations behind what we're

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:13.780
doing.

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:14.988
So I do hope you attend that.

00:01:14.988 --> 00:01:17.886
It's going to be right after
this if you're here live.

00:01:17.886 --> 00:01:19.010
Let's go through our panel.

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:21.170
We've got a great
group of people here.

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:23.950
I'm going to introduce
them very briefly.

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:26.520
So we start off Sourabh Ahuja.

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:28.220
He's from Glu Mobile.

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:30.550
Glu Mobile makes
awesome action games.

00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:33.810
They really are one of
the first companies that

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:37.500
really got heavily
into Free to Play

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:39.259
We have Ari Kardasis
from Space Inch,

00:01:39.259 --> 00:01:40.550
which is a really cool company.

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:43.740
You should definitely look up
the stuff that they're doing.

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:46.620
They just came out-- their
latest game, "Make It Rain,"

00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:47.700
is awesome.

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:51.220
It's this crazy combination of
social commentary and spoof.

00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:54.786
And he was also, of course, the
designer of "Disco Bees," which

00:01:54.786 --> 00:01:57.230
is a really a
great game as well.

00:01:57.230 --> 00:02:00.014
We have Guilherme
Lachaut from Gameloft.

00:02:00.014 --> 00:02:02.180
I don't think I have to say
anything about Gameloft.

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:03.055
Their games are epic.

00:02:03.055 --> 00:02:05.320
A bunch of them are on
the floor if you go look

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:09.400
at what we're showing
on Android TV today.

00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:11.930
But just super, super
high-quality games

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:14.690
in every genre.

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:18.990
We have Keith Pichelman
from Concrete.

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:20.990
It's great the variety
of companies we have here

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:22.823
and the variety of
experiences we have here,

00:02:22.823 --> 00:02:24.360
and the way all
of these companies

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:26.840
actually can
benefit by the stuff

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:28.780
we're doing around
gaming on Google Play.

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:31.910
And Concrete is a
25-person company.

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:33.120
They're from Minneapolis.

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:35.970
And they make the coolest
multiplayer bowling

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:39.550
game that is on Google Play.

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:41.270
It is really, really awesome.

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:42.990
And you should also
go check it out.

00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:46.060
And then finally, we
have Lloyd Tullues.

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:48.340
He is here representing
Electronic Arts.

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:50.280
And I don't even
have to tell you

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:52.450
all of the things
Electronic Arts has done.

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:56.940
And again, a company that does
amazingly high-quality games

00:02:56.940 --> 00:02:59.590
in every genre on Google Play.

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:02.229
So that is our
distinguished panel.

00:03:02.229 --> 00:03:04.520
And we are going to be talking
not just about Play Game

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:07.600
services, but we're also going
to be talking about the game

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:11.090
industry in general
and Google Play.

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:15.020
So here is my first
question for our panelists.

00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:18.775
And out of the
Play Games features

00:03:18.775 --> 00:03:20.970
that you've integrated
into your games, which

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:23.090
have been the most valuable?

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:26.700
We'll start this
direction for now.

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:29.850
SOURABH AHUJA: So for
Glu and for our users,

00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:33.330
I would say Cloud Save has
been the most valuable.

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:35.950
It helps us provide that
seamless experience.

00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:38.090
People nowadays have their
phones, their tablets.

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:41.050
And now some of you
have the Android TV.

00:03:41.050 --> 00:03:43.955
And you can take your
game back and forth,

00:03:43.955 --> 00:03:47.200
the 2014 works
across all of them.

00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:48.170
And it's free.

00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:53.490
DAN GALPIN: All right.

00:03:53.490 --> 00:03:56.770
ARI KARDASIS: So for us,
we're very, very small.

00:03:56.770 --> 00:03:59.470
I'm a designer and a developer,
and I'm sitting here.

00:03:59.470 --> 00:04:03.890
So anything that we can
get out of Google Play

00:04:03.890 --> 00:04:07.110
game services that can eliminate
some of the overhead for us

00:04:07.110 --> 00:04:09.340
is really super important.

00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:11.190
In particular, achievements
is great for us,

00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:13.650
because our games
are not multiplayer,

00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:16.190
and it really helps
engagement a lot.

00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:17.814
And yeah, it's been
a great experience.

00:04:20.038 --> 00:04:21.246
GUILHERME LACHAUT: Thank you.

00:04:21.246 --> 00:04:22.560
So hello everyone.

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:24.860
Talking about
Gameloft, so Dan said,

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:26.410
we have a white
portfolio of games.

00:04:26.410 --> 00:04:28.370
And it's true that when it
comes to infrastructure, when

00:04:28.370 --> 00:04:30.230
it comes to multiplayer
and Cloud Saver,

00:04:30.230 --> 00:04:32.740
we're using our own system.

00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:34.940
So we're mainly using
achievements and leader boards

00:04:34.940 --> 00:04:35.481
in our games.

00:04:35.481 --> 00:04:37.835
And I would say that when
it comes to achievements,

00:04:37.835 --> 00:04:41.980
this is where we've seen
the highest engagement.

00:04:41.980 --> 00:04:43.650
Most of our games
now are free to play.

00:04:43.650 --> 00:04:45.920
And when you're
talking about users,

00:04:45.920 --> 00:04:48.070
you first have user acquisition.

00:04:48.070 --> 00:04:50.370
But then engagement and
retention is really important.

00:04:50.370 --> 00:04:53.940
And so achievements have
achieved to bring competition,

00:04:53.940 --> 00:04:55.770
and I think also the
fact that now there's

00:04:55.770 --> 00:04:58.689
game profiles into the
main [INAUDIBLE] map

00:04:58.689 --> 00:05:00.230
is very interesting,
because we think

00:05:00.230 --> 00:05:02.570
it's going to continue this
trend of having people compete

00:05:02.570 --> 00:05:04.986
for the games and being able
to see what their friends are

00:05:04.986 --> 00:05:05.590
doing.

00:05:05.590 --> 00:05:06.980
DAN GALPIN: I can
say personally,

00:05:06.980 --> 00:05:09.740
I went and played
"I/O Hunt" here

00:05:09.740 --> 00:05:11.227
at Google I/O, which is awesome.

00:05:11.227 --> 00:05:12.810
If you guys who are
actually attending

00:05:12.810 --> 00:05:14.250
haven't played it
yet, you should.

00:05:14.250 --> 00:05:16.458
Partially just because there
are a lot of achievement

00:05:16.458 --> 00:05:19.060
points to be had, and I leveled
up my profile right here

00:05:19.060 --> 00:05:21.377
at Google I/O.

00:05:21.377 --> 00:05:22.293
KEITH PICHELMAN: Yeah.

00:05:22.293 --> 00:05:26.378
For us, our flagship game right
now is "PBA Bowling Challenge".

00:05:26.378 --> 00:05:28.586
And we've integrated all
the game services right now,

00:05:28.586 --> 00:05:31.200
and they've all been
really big for us.

00:05:31.200 --> 00:05:33.840
But the biggest
by far is probably

00:05:33.840 --> 00:05:35.840
the multiplayer and
the game services.

00:05:35.840 --> 00:05:38.010
When we first released
"PBA Bowling Challenge",

00:05:38.010 --> 00:05:41.120
it didn't have the
multiplayer mode.

00:05:41.120 --> 00:05:44.210
We quickly started getting a
lot of fans, a lot of users.

00:05:44.210 --> 00:05:46.080
And it was really
tough to keep up

00:05:46.080 --> 00:05:48.830
with enough content
for all those users.

00:05:48.830 --> 00:05:51.390
They kept on coming back
asking for more alleys and more

00:05:51.390 --> 00:05:54.360
things unlocked,
more achievements.

00:05:54.360 --> 00:05:56.240
By adding multiplayer,
that really

00:05:56.240 --> 00:05:59.260
opened up to where people
would play forever.

00:05:59.260 --> 00:06:02.009
They could play random
people, their friends.

00:06:02.009 --> 00:06:03.550
And each game was
a little different.

00:06:03.550 --> 00:06:05.420
It was kind of funny,
having it be real time.

00:06:05.420 --> 00:06:07.461
We were actually looking
for an asynchronous type

00:06:07.461 --> 00:06:08.460
of a multiplayer.

00:06:08.460 --> 00:06:10.020
And real time has
been fantastic,

00:06:10.020 --> 00:06:13.074
because it's actually exciting
to watch the other player

00:06:13.074 --> 00:06:14.740
roll through the
different bowling balls

00:06:14.740 --> 00:06:16.910
and kind of see, oh,
hey, look at that one.

00:06:16.910 --> 00:06:17.410
Oh!

00:06:17.410 --> 00:06:18.850
They used this ball.

00:06:18.850 --> 00:06:21.600
And it's really been
great for engagement.

00:06:21.600 --> 00:06:24.520
And you can see our
users talk about it a lot

00:06:24.520 --> 00:06:26.800
and talk about how they
play against each other.

00:06:29.330 --> 00:06:31.020
LLOYD TULLUES: So
we've been focusing

00:06:31.020 --> 00:06:33.790
much more on achievements
and leader boards

00:06:33.790 --> 00:06:35.950
through a great
many of our games.

00:06:35.950 --> 00:06:38.130
And we've already seen
a tremendous amount

00:06:38.130 --> 00:06:39.840
of value out of that.

00:06:39.840 --> 00:06:43.740
Mainly because it's
a seamless experience

00:06:43.740 --> 00:06:46.750
and a consistent experience
for users across our games.

00:06:46.750 --> 00:06:48.560
But if we step
back a little bit,

00:06:48.560 --> 00:06:51.820
the most valuable feature we've
gotten out of game services

00:06:51.820 --> 00:06:56.050
is just having a
single sign on identity

00:06:56.050 --> 00:06:58.860
that follows the user
between older devices.

00:06:58.860 --> 00:07:02.040
So your achievements
follow you on your phone

00:07:02.040 --> 00:07:05.500
versus your tablet, now on
your television and so on.

00:07:05.500 --> 00:07:09.330
And just having that
experience across all of those

00:07:09.330 --> 00:07:11.522
devices has been fantastic.

00:07:11.522 --> 00:07:12.230
DAN GALPIN: Yeah.

00:07:12.230 --> 00:07:15.020
For everyone who is
on the Android team,

00:07:15.020 --> 00:07:18.330
we pretty much won't
play a game unless it

00:07:18.330 --> 00:07:19.830
has some sort of
Cloud Save feature.

00:07:19.830 --> 00:07:22.290
Because we're always
reflashing devices,

00:07:22.290 --> 00:07:24.102
things are in development,
we're testing,

00:07:24.102 --> 00:07:25.560
we're moving from
device to device.

00:07:25.560 --> 00:07:27.780
Most of us have at least
a tablet and a phone.

00:07:27.780 --> 00:07:29.395
And we want to play
on the best device

00:07:29.395 --> 00:07:32.054
that we happen to
have at a time.

00:07:32.054 --> 00:07:33.720
I'll tell someone,
this game is awesome!

00:07:33.720 --> 00:07:35.620
And they're like, does
it have Cloud Save?

00:07:35.620 --> 00:07:37.460
That's the first
question they'll ask me.

00:07:37.460 --> 00:07:38.979
And so it really means a lot.

00:07:38.979 --> 00:07:41.270
And I think we're seeing more
and more people out there

00:07:41.270 --> 00:07:44.710
in the community
actually representing

00:07:44.710 --> 00:07:46.280
a very similar kind
of demographic.

00:07:48.800 --> 00:07:50.190
So the next question.

00:07:50.190 --> 00:07:53.802
As we look into future launch
titles-- we're talking again,

00:07:53.802 --> 00:07:56.260
I know they're talking about
Play game services a lot here,

00:07:56.260 --> 00:07:58.830
but I'm hoping we can kind
of stretch the topics out

00:07:58.830 --> 00:07:59.820
beyond this.

00:07:59.820 --> 00:08:01.490
But if you look to
launch future titles,

00:08:01.490 --> 00:08:03.073
how do you plan to
leverage what we're

00:08:03.073 --> 00:08:04.459
doing in Play game services?

00:08:04.459 --> 00:08:06.000
SOURABH AHUJA: So
we're going to keep

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:08.380
using what we do with the
[? team ?] leaderboards, Cloud

00:08:08.380 --> 00:08:10.220
Save, retain those power users.

00:08:10.220 --> 00:08:12.530
But the new features,
gifting-- we just

00:08:12.530 --> 00:08:14.210
implemented it in
"Eternity Warriors 3".

00:08:14.210 --> 00:08:16.430
We're experimenting
with that, made popular

00:08:16.430 --> 00:08:17.690
by "Candy Crush" of course.

00:08:17.690 --> 00:08:22.530
But again, we get a free
way of trying that system

00:08:22.530 --> 00:08:23.400
through GPGS.

00:08:23.400 --> 00:08:25.260
So that's happening.

00:08:25.260 --> 00:08:29.830
We're actually putting in Quests
and snapshots of saved games

00:08:29.830 --> 00:08:31.430
in "RoboCup" right now.

00:08:31.430 --> 00:08:33.409
We're going live
early July, and we're

00:08:33.409 --> 00:08:36.450
excited to see how the
metrics of those pan out.

00:08:36.450 --> 00:08:39.650
And that's the
current plan for GPGS.

00:08:39.650 --> 00:08:40.650
DAN GALPIN: And it's OK.

00:08:40.650 --> 00:08:42.559
The packaged name for
saved games is snapshots.

00:08:42.559 --> 00:08:44.267
So if you're actually
looking at the API,

00:08:44.267 --> 00:08:45.840
that's what it looks like.

00:08:45.840 --> 00:08:50.210
But the consumer
name is saved games.

00:08:50.210 --> 00:08:51.950
ARI KARDASIS: So
our games tend to be

00:08:51.950 --> 00:08:54.040
somewhat one player
at this point.

00:08:54.040 --> 00:08:56.480
We're not really implementing
a lot of social stuff.

00:08:56.480 --> 00:08:58.740
So I think moving
forward, not only

00:08:58.740 --> 00:09:00.530
are we interested in
competitive gaming,

00:09:00.530 --> 00:09:02.450
but also collaborative gaming.

00:09:02.450 --> 00:09:06.050
We had a game about a year ago
called "Say the Same Thing",

00:09:06.050 --> 00:09:07.510
which was a collaborative game.

00:09:07.510 --> 00:09:10.080
And I think we didn't
ever quite figure out

00:09:10.080 --> 00:09:11.220
how to monopolize on that.

00:09:11.220 --> 00:09:13.104
And I think that Google
Play game services

00:09:13.104 --> 00:09:14.770
is the kind of thing
where we can really

00:09:14.770 --> 00:09:16.670
get people to engage
with their friends,

00:09:16.670 --> 00:09:20.837
to work together to
achieve things in games.

00:09:20.837 --> 00:09:22.920
GUILHERME LACHAUT: I think
when it comes to games,

00:09:22.920 --> 00:09:26.400
we're really working on bringing
quality games-- HD triple

00:09:26.400 --> 00:09:27.240
A games.

00:09:27.240 --> 00:09:28.990
But also on the
social part of it.

00:09:28.990 --> 00:09:30.980
And I think where Google
Play game services

00:09:30.980 --> 00:09:33.170
is really interesting
is once again the leader

00:09:33.170 --> 00:09:36.475
boards, the achievements,
and the new quests also

00:09:36.475 --> 00:09:37.600
is very interesting for us.

00:09:37.600 --> 00:09:39.349
Because it's going to
bring something new.

00:09:39.349 --> 00:09:41.450
We wanted to bring something
unique to the Android

00:09:41.450 --> 00:09:43.780
community, and this
is a great way for us

00:09:43.780 --> 00:09:46.480
to continue launching it
with all our new games.

00:09:46.480 --> 00:09:48.650
Implementing it all
the time, for us,

00:09:48.650 --> 00:09:51.621
is a great way to really keep
it social, having sure everybody

00:09:51.621 --> 00:09:53.120
can see what their
other friends are

00:09:53.120 --> 00:09:54.750
doing, what games
they're playing.

00:09:54.750 --> 00:09:57.190
And for us, it's a
key strategy to have

00:09:57.190 --> 00:10:01.200
it implemented in most
our upcoming tiles.

00:10:01.200 --> 00:10:02.900
KEITH PICHELMAN:
Yeah, we'll certainly

00:10:02.900 --> 00:10:06.200
keep using all the Google
Play game services,

00:10:06.200 --> 00:10:08.040
they've been really
valuable so far.

00:10:08.040 --> 00:10:11.220
I think we're most
excited about Quests.

00:10:11.220 --> 00:10:13.890
I mean, we really look
at Quests as being a way

00:10:13.890 --> 00:10:15.350
to have live events.

00:10:15.350 --> 00:10:17.790
If you look at a lot of the
big games out there now,

00:10:17.790 --> 00:10:22.090
they have live events,
short events, longer events.

00:10:22.090 --> 00:10:26.540
We're always looking at ways
to keep our users engaged,

00:10:26.540 --> 00:10:29.490
keep the game with new content.

00:10:29.490 --> 00:10:33.340
And by not having again to build
new alleys and tournaments all

00:10:33.340 --> 00:10:35.260
the time, we can
do a lot, I think,

00:10:35.260 --> 00:10:39.660
with Quests and
making those events.

00:10:39.660 --> 00:10:43.281
LLOYD TULLUES: So I'm going to
go back to my previous answer

00:10:43.281 --> 00:10:44.030
and build on that.

00:10:44.030 --> 00:10:47.110
So when we are
looking at our users

00:10:47.110 --> 00:10:49.760
and realize that they
have multiple devices

00:10:49.760 --> 00:10:51.930
on different platforms,
we want to give them

00:10:51.930 --> 00:10:54.170
a consistent across
all those devices.

00:10:54.170 --> 00:10:57.450
So for, cloud saves
are particularly--

00:10:57.450 --> 00:10:59.450
game saves are particularly
exciting, especially

00:10:59.450 --> 00:11:01.910
with the new features
that are coming up,

00:11:01.910 --> 00:11:06.370
that we can leverage across
different device types as well

00:11:06.370 --> 00:11:08.446
as different platforms.

00:11:08.446 --> 00:11:09.820
And so for us,
that's going to be

00:11:09.820 --> 00:11:14.949
a very exciting
feature to leverage.

00:11:14.949 --> 00:11:16.490
And I wanted to make
the comment too,

00:11:16.490 --> 00:11:19.830
that it's interesting how
game services is almost

00:11:19.830 --> 00:11:21.820
becoming its own game platform.

00:11:21.820 --> 00:11:25.240
We can start leveraging
the users in Google Play,

00:11:25.240 --> 00:11:28.070
as you guys are kind of
putting that competitive nature

00:11:28.070 --> 00:11:32.460
against users that may
not even be friends.

00:11:32.460 --> 00:11:35.940
And so as we build on
achievements in leader boards,

00:11:35.940 --> 00:11:41.040
we can then leverage
Google's competitive features

00:11:41.040 --> 00:11:43.282
and then keep engaging
users that way.

00:11:43.282 --> 00:11:44.240
DAN GALPIN: Absolutely.

00:11:44.240 --> 00:11:47.030
And I'll say,
completely, that part

00:11:47.030 --> 00:11:49.250
of the reason I went off
and played "I/O Hunt"

00:11:49.250 --> 00:11:53.410
here is that I was trying
to outdo Bob Meese's profile

00:11:53.410 --> 00:11:53.910
score.

00:11:53.910 --> 00:11:56.840
Bob Meese is the head of our
business development team here.

00:11:56.840 --> 00:11:58.410
Point of honor.

00:11:58.410 --> 00:12:00.740
Yeah, again, I think
what's really exciting too

00:12:00.740 --> 00:12:03.480
is that we have the
services across to iOS.

00:12:03.480 --> 00:12:08.240
We're launching actually
both saved games and Quests

00:12:08.240 --> 00:12:12.410
simultaneously for not just iOS,
but also our cross platform C++

00:12:12.410 --> 00:12:13.560
SDK.

00:12:13.560 --> 00:12:16.480
And I'm really excited
about giving people

00:12:16.480 --> 00:12:19.279
who have devices that are
in both families actually

00:12:19.279 --> 00:12:21.320
the ability to play together
and the ability also

00:12:21.320 --> 00:12:25.630
to bring saves from
one device to another.

00:12:25.630 --> 00:12:27.420
All right.

00:12:27.420 --> 00:12:28.480
Feedback from players.

00:12:28.480 --> 00:12:31.740
What do they say
when you integrate

00:12:31.740 --> 00:12:34.590
this, when you
don't integrate it?

00:12:34.590 --> 00:12:35.790
Just kind of talk about it.

00:12:35.790 --> 00:12:37.415
SOURABH AHUJA: So
it's mostly positive.

00:12:37.415 --> 00:12:40.010
People love the fact the
competitive elements which

00:12:40.010 --> 00:12:43.100
were missing before, or were
not going from one device

00:12:43.100 --> 00:12:44.690
to another, so they like that.

00:12:44.690 --> 00:12:49.130
There are some negatives, which
it was just touched about.

00:12:49.130 --> 00:12:51.760
Like lack of it being
a gamer network,

00:12:51.760 --> 00:12:56.880
where people struggle finding
their friends any inviting them

00:12:56.880 --> 00:13:00.080
to play with because they're
not in the Google+ circles.

00:13:00.080 --> 00:13:02.520
It's getting better, and I
think it will only get better

00:13:02.520 --> 00:13:07.050
if everybody in this room starts
putting GPGS in their game,

00:13:07.050 --> 00:13:09.580
so that we can all
leverage each other's users

00:13:09.580 --> 00:13:11.520
and everybody's there,
so it's easy to find

00:13:11.520 --> 00:13:12.800
your friends to play with.

00:13:15.894 --> 00:13:17.560
ARI KARDASIS: Well,
I try to stay as far

00:13:17.560 --> 00:13:19.450
from customer service as I can.

00:13:19.450 --> 00:13:23.320
But we really start
games with Google Play.

00:13:23.320 --> 00:13:27.190
So nobody's ever complaining
about it not being in there.

00:13:27.190 --> 00:13:29.890
And it's been great.

00:13:29.890 --> 00:13:33.350
I mean I don't think anybody has
anything negative to say to us,

00:13:33.350 --> 00:13:36.790
and it's definitely
helpful for them.

00:13:36.790 --> 00:13:38.040
GUILHERME LACHAUT: It's funny.

00:13:38.040 --> 00:13:40.179
When it comes to gaming,
when users are happy,

00:13:40.179 --> 00:13:41.470
they're just playing your game.

00:13:41.470 --> 00:13:43.146
You don't hear them that much.

00:13:43.146 --> 00:13:45.270
But actually, when you
don't implement the services

00:13:45.270 --> 00:13:47.150
in your game-- so
we've implemented it

00:13:47.150 --> 00:13:49.650
in most of our new games,
but sometimes legacy games

00:13:49.650 --> 00:13:52.520
does not necessarily have it
at launch and need updates.

00:13:52.520 --> 00:13:55.150
And so this is usually when
we hear our customers saying,

00:13:55.150 --> 00:13:56.000
where are our achievements?

00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:58.458
Where are our leader boards
from Google Play game services?

00:13:58.458 --> 00:14:01.820
Because I think, once again,
it's creating a community.

00:14:01.820 --> 00:14:05.124
And when it's there,
they're enjoying it.

00:14:05.124 --> 00:14:07.290
But when it's not there,
they're not [INAUDIBLE] it.

00:14:07.290 --> 00:14:10.680
So I think really now, it's part
of what users are expecting.

00:14:10.680 --> 00:14:12.775
So we've never received
any complaints about it,

00:14:12.775 --> 00:14:14.150
but I think it's
really something

00:14:14.150 --> 00:14:15.790
that now users
are expecting when

00:14:15.790 --> 00:14:17.750
they're playing on their games.

00:14:17.750 --> 00:14:20.800
So it really has become a
truthful gaming experience

00:14:20.800 --> 00:14:21.510
for users.

00:14:21.510 --> 00:14:21.800
DAN GALPIN: Yeah.

00:14:21.800 --> 00:14:23.900
One of the things I'm
excited about-- and going

00:14:23.900 --> 00:14:28.740
from original feature, which
was app state, or game state,

00:14:28.740 --> 00:14:33.410
to now we new have-- we have,
new, thank you, I can speak.

00:14:33.410 --> 00:14:36.840
In terms of a game saves, it
actually shows up as a badge

00:14:36.840 --> 00:14:37.740
now.

00:14:37.740 --> 00:14:38.950
And that was a big problem.

00:14:38.950 --> 00:14:41.100
A lot of people didn't
know, when people actually

00:14:41.100 --> 00:14:42.600
implementing our
Cloud Save feature,

00:14:42.600 --> 00:14:43.933
and now it'll be right up front.

00:14:43.933 --> 00:14:46.085
Immediately I know, yes,
it's going to be there.

00:14:46.085 --> 00:14:47.960
Yes, I know my state's
going to be preserved.

00:14:47.960 --> 00:14:49.626
So I think it's a
really important thing

00:14:49.626 --> 00:14:51.484
for users to be able to see.

00:14:51.484 --> 00:14:52.400
KEITH PICHELMAN: Yeah.

00:14:52.400 --> 00:14:55.640
Our users absolutely
love game services.

00:14:55.640 --> 00:14:57.050
When we added multiplayer.

00:14:57.050 --> 00:14:59.030
I mean they are definitely
now the most vocal

00:14:59.030 --> 00:15:01.330
and have been playing
for the longest.

00:15:01.330 --> 00:15:04.420
And then with achievements.

00:15:04.420 --> 00:15:07.300
I mean it's become more
of a hobby for them

00:15:07.300 --> 00:15:09.320
now, where if
something is wrong,

00:15:09.320 --> 00:15:10.800
we hear about it immediately.

00:15:10.800 --> 00:15:12.925
Or if you see somebody
who's hacked into the system

00:15:12.925 --> 00:15:15.460
and gets a high score
in a leader board,

00:15:15.460 --> 00:15:16.970
we definitely do
not find it first.

00:15:16.970 --> 00:15:20.490
They tell us within about two
seconds that something's wrong.

00:15:20.490 --> 00:15:22.350
They watch all that closely.

00:15:22.350 --> 00:15:24.140
They love the multiplayer.

00:15:24.140 --> 00:15:26.527
They love all the
different services.

00:15:26.527 --> 00:15:28.860
DAN GALPIN: Now, your users
have actually gone and built

00:15:28.860 --> 00:15:30.864
their own community
around the game.

00:15:30.864 --> 00:15:31.780
KEITH PICHELMAN: Yeah.

00:15:31.780 --> 00:15:33.320
It's really been interesting.

00:15:33.320 --> 00:15:35.130
After the game was
out for a little bit,

00:15:35.130 --> 00:15:38.220
we happened to run across that
somebody created a "PBA Bowling

00:15:38.220 --> 00:15:40.550
Challenge" Google+ page.

00:15:40.550 --> 00:15:41.520
Running it themselves.

00:15:41.520 --> 00:15:43.728
And we just were kind of
were watching it for awhile,

00:15:43.728 --> 00:15:46.870
until we finally joined
in to help them out.

00:15:46.870 --> 00:15:48.720
I mean, they are so social.

00:15:48.720 --> 00:15:50.830
They love talking to each other.

00:15:50.830 --> 00:15:53.320
They're posting videos of how
they use different bowling

00:15:53.320 --> 00:15:55.170
balls, they put different
spin on the balls.

00:15:55.170 --> 00:15:58.110
And they spent a lot
of time in there.

00:15:58.110 --> 00:16:00.110
In fact, that's
one of the things

00:16:00.110 --> 00:16:01.560
we've learned from our users.

00:16:01.560 --> 00:16:04.340
If they're that passion
about coming out and creating

00:16:04.340 --> 00:16:06.860
this community outside the
game, that's obviously something

00:16:06.860 --> 00:16:08.890
we should have inside the game.

00:16:08.890 --> 00:16:10.265
DAN GALPIN: Have
you guys thought

00:16:10.265 --> 00:16:12.015
about actually doing
a YouTube integration

00:16:12.015 --> 00:16:14.385
and making it so users can
post videos over there?

00:16:14.385 --> 00:16:15.760
KEITH PICHELMAN:
Absolutely, Dan.

00:16:15.760 --> 00:16:17.500
Yeah.

00:16:17.500 --> 00:16:20.670
It was funny, we actually
talked about that early on.

00:16:20.670 --> 00:16:23.800
We were like, eh, do people
really want to post stuff?

00:16:23.800 --> 00:16:25.840
A roll down the lane.

00:16:25.840 --> 00:16:28.164
We actually decided
people weren't

00:16:28.164 --> 00:16:29.580
going to be that
excited about it.

00:16:29.580 --> 00:16:30.788
But we were absolutely wrong.

00:16:30.788 --> 00:16:33.880
And yeah, we've been
researching exactly how

00:16:33.880 --> 00:16:35.290
we're going to do that now.

00:16:35.290 --> 00:16:37.670
DAN GALPIN: That's great.

00:16:37.670 --> 00:16:42.370
LLOYD TULLUES: So for
us, no news is good news.

00:16:42.370 --> 00:16:44.310
We've integrated game services.

00:16:44.310 --> 00:16:48.200
And like I said earlier,
a great host of our games.

00:16:48.200 --> 00:16:50.970
And we don't really
hear negative feedback

00:16:50.970 --> 00:16:53.030
to kind of reiterate
the earlier points.

00:16:53.030 --> 00:16:56.414
Which is, from our
perspective, fantastic.

00:16:56.414 --> 00:16:57.830
And so for that
reason, we're just

00:16:57.830 --> 00:17:01.010
going to keep integrating
more and more of the features

00:17:01.010 --> 00:17:02.942
and see where we can take it.

00:17:02.942 --> 00:17:04.359
DAN GALPIN: Awesome.

00:17:04.359 --> 00:17:05.940
All right.

00:17:05.940 --> 00:17:08.490
So challenges now.

00:17:08.490 --> 00:17:09.890
Obviously, we talked about one.

00:17:09.890 --> 00:17:12.511
First of all, we want
a better social graph.

00:17:12.511 --> 00:17:14.010
That's the first
thing we mentioned.

00:17:14.010 --> 00:17:16.661
What else can we do better?

00:17:16.661 --> 00:17:18.369
SOURABH AHUJA: I think
now that everybody

00:17:18.369 --> 00:17:20.440
is starting to put
it in, I'm hoping

00:17:20.440 --> 00:17:22.619
that you guys have enough data.

00:17:22.619 --> 00:17:27.730
So one of the challenges is
acquiring the right users.

00:17:27.730 --> 00:17:31.270
And the recommendation
engine in Google Play games

00:17:31.270 --> 00:17:35.340
can help everybody who's
making similar games in getting

00:17:35.340 --> 00:17:38.700
the power users introduced to
the new game which is similar.

00:17:38.700 --> 00:17:41.980
That will be really helpful
for the ecosystem, I think.

00:17:41.980 --> 00:17:43.810
I'm not sure how you
guys are doing it,

00:17:43.810 --> 00:17:46.230
but it'll be great if
that's happening right now.

00:17:46.230 --> 00:17:48.313
DAN GALPIN: What do you
guys think of, in general,

00:17:48.313 --> 00:17:51.590
the demographic features that
we put into the developer

00:17:51.590 --> 00:17:52.339
dashboard?

00:17:52.339 --> 00:17:53.130
SOURABH AHUJA: Yes.

00:17:53.130 --> 00:17:56.020
The entire analytics,
it's very high level,

00:17:56.020 --> 00:17:59.540
but it's very-- we all have, of
course, our analytics back end.

00:17:59.540 --> 00:18:03.170
But the high level stuff you
get from Google Play games

00:18:03.170 --> 00:18:04.350
analytics is very useful.

00:18:04.350 --> 00:18:06.010
Like the demographics,
the retention,

00:18:06.010 --> 00:18:07.430
all that information.

00:18:07.430 --> 00:18:09.020
And now there is
more tools which

00:18:09.020 --> 00:18:11.800
I think Ellie showed
of the Google Analytics

00:18:11.800 --> 00:18:15.890
And actually measuring your
user acquisition campaigns,

00:18:15.890 --> 00:18:18.100
which we're already
starting to look into today.

00:18:18.100 --> 00:18:21.480
So I think all that
stuff is very helpful.

00:18:21.480 --> 00:18:24.340
ARI KARDASIS: As
a developer who's

00:18:24.340 --> 00:18:26.040
spread pretty thin
most of the time,

00:18:26.040 --> 00:18:28.820
I think the biggest complaint I
would have is just sort of not

00:18:28.820 --> 00:18:32.310
really knowing the full
landscape of what Google Play

00:18:32.310 --> 00:18:34.180
game services can do.

00:18:34.180 --> 00:18:35.680
I know that there's
a lot out there.

00:18:35.680 --> 00:18:39.320
And we've done
achievements and sign in,

00:18:39.320 --> 00:18:41.560
and I think we're working
on some leader boards.

00:18:41.560 --> 00:18:45.290
But like demographics
and analytics,

00:18:45.290 --> 00:18:46.720
I didn't really
know that existed.

00:18:46.720 --> 00:18:48.850
So I think maybe
communicating with us better,

00:18:48.850 --> 00:18:51.870
to know what's useful for maybe
different types of developers

00:18:51.870 --> 00:18:54.372
at different stages in
their company cycle.

00:18:54.372 --> 00:18:55.080
DAN GALPIN: Yeah.

00:18:55.080 --> 00:18:59.000
I think we talked a lot about
the Play analytics features,

00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:00.840
and we actually
announced it at GDC.

00:19:00.840 --> 00:19:03.000
But we haven't gone
around trumpeting it.

00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:05.800
And part of the reason
we didn't do that was it

00:19:05.800 --> 00:19:07.050
wasn't quite done.

00:19:07.050 --> 00:19:08.910
We didn't integrate
demographic features

00:19:08.910 --> 00:19:10.720
until a few months later.

00:19:10.720 --> 00:19:13.535
And we really felt that, when
you actually can not only see,

00:19:13.535 --> 00:19:16.479
you know, look at the 5 day
and the 10 day and 15 day

00:19:16.479 --> 00:19:18.770
retention, look at how that
compares with achievements,

00:19:18.770 --> 00:19:20.603
then you can actually
see which demographics

00:19:20.603 --> 00:19:21.630
you're resonating with.

00:19:21.630 --> 00:19:26.130
That just adds a lot of
important data for our game

00:19:26.130 --> 00:19:27.640
makers.

00:19:27.640 --> 00:19:29.600
So I think now, we're
more excited to talk

00:19:29.600 --> 00:19:31.434
about it as a feature.

00:19:31.434 --> 00:19:33.100
GUILHERME LACHAUT: I
think with Gameloft

00:19:33.100 --> 00:19:34.600
we've always tried
to be innovative.

00:19:34.600 --> 00:19:38.330
So lots of innovative
features and social features,

00:19:38.330 --> 00:19:41.010
we've tried to implement
them within our own back end.

00:19:41.010 --> 00:19:44.720
So I think one of the challenges
was to all those features,

00:19:44.720 --> 00:19:46.720
but not to duplicate what
we were already doing.

00:19:46.720 --> 00:19:48.720
So it's finding
new, innovative ways

00:19:48.720 --> 00:19:52.430
to bring additional
content to our users.

00:19:52.430 --> 00:19:53.817
And it's worked great until now.

00:19:53.817 --> 00:19:55.650
So we're really thrilled
about the services.

00:19:55.650 --> 00:19:57.800
And I think one of the
main challenges we've

00:19:57.800 --> 00:20:01.640
seen with the services
is the sign in process.

00:20:01.640 --> 00:20:04.090
We think a great
evolution of the service

00:20:04.090 --> 00:20:08.273
would be to ease and to
help users having kind

00:20:08.273 --> 00:20:11.100
of an opt-in option, where they
could have a single sign on.

00:20:11.100 --> 00:20:12.490
They would need
to just once say,

00:20:12.490 --> 00:20:14.760
OK, I accept to sign
in into those services

00:20:14.760 --> 00:20:17.680
and into all of my games and
never have to sign in again.

00:20:17.680 --> 00:20:20.030
So I think this is, for
me, an evolution that

00:20:20.030 --> 00:20:21.912
would be very beneficial
to the services.

00:20:21.912 --> 00:20:22.620
DAN GALPIN: Yeah.

00:20:22.620 --> 00:20:23.640
It's always a balance.

00:20:23.640 --> 00:20:26.690
I think at Google,
one of things that we

00:20:26.690 --> 00:20:29.820
take incredibly
seriously is privacy.

00:20:29.820 --> 00:20:31.780
And it's always
making sure that we

00:20:31.780 --> 00:20:34.312
give the best possible
service to our users

00:20:34.312 --> 00:20:36.270
while making sure they
have absolutely the most

00:20:36.270 --> 00:20:39.050
control over every piece
of information they share.

00:20:39.050 --> 00:20:41.190
And I'm hoping we
can figure out a way

00:20:41.190 --> 00:20:44.090
to strike that balance that's
even less obtrusive than we've

00:20:44.090 --> 00:20:44.910
done already.

00:20:44.910 --> 00:20:48.264
But I think that for us is
always going to be a challenge.

00:20:48.264 --> 00:20:49.180
KEITH PICHELMAN: Yeah.

00:20:49.180 --> 00:20:50.471
I can think of a couple things.

00:20:50.471 --> 00:20:54.130
One minor thing would just
be with our leader boards

00:20:54.130 --> 00:20:56.130
in the bowling game.

00:20:56.130 --> 00:20:58.800
Most people, when they bowl,
they compare by average.

00:20:58.800 --> 00:21:02.829
So we'd love to be able to
have a leader board type

00:21:02.829 --> 00:21:05.120
thing with average, so they
can kind of go up and down.

00:21:05.120 --> 00:21:07.500
Not just go up, like in points.

00:21:07.500 --> 00:21:09.880
DAN GALPIN: We have leader
boards that can go only down.

00:21:09.880 --> 00:21:11.590
And leader boards
that can go only up.

00:21:11.590 --> 00:21:13.342
But we actually don't
have the ability

00:21:13.342 --> 00:21:14.550
to have an average like that.

00:21:14.550 --> 00:21:15.315
KEITH PICHELMAN:
Which would be great

00:21:15.315 --> 00:21:17.200
if that really happened in
bowling, if your average always

00:21:17.200 --> 00:21:18.040
went up.

00:21:18.040 --> 00:21:19.330
DAN GALPIN: Yeah exactly.

00:21:19.330 --> 00:21:20.370
KEITH PICHELMAN:
The other thing--

00:21:20.370 --> 00:21:21.411
DAN GALPIN: Peak average.

00:21:21.411 --> 00:21:24.260
KEITH PICHELMAN:
--is multiplayer

00:21:24.260 --> 00:21:27.970
was the biggest service we've
added that's really helped out

00:21:27.970 --> 00:21:30.410
our games quite a bit.

00:21:30.410 --> 00:21:31.820
If we could add more to that.

00:21:31.820 --> 00:21:34.940
Like right now we have
users all over the board,

00:21:34.940 --> 00:21:37.010
as far as experience.

00:21:37.010 --> 00:21:40.570
We've started out the game, we
actually had a cap of level 99,

00:21:40.570 --> 00:21:42.870
and people blew through
that immediately.

00:21:42.870 --> 00:21:45.620
And we raised it to--
I don't know why-- 199.

00:21:45.620 --> 00:21:47.280
Of course that didn't
last very long.

00:21:47.280 --> 00:21:49.860
And now today, we
have a capital of 999.

00:21:49.860 --> 00:21:52.300
And people are
hitting that as well.

00:21:52.300 --> 00:21:54.500
It's a challenge
when we match up

00:21:54.500 --> 00:21:57.240
players that are say, like,
level 750 to somebody who's

00:21:57.240 --> 00:21:58.400
level 10.

00:21:58.400 --> 00:22:00.150
It doesn't make sense
at all, and they'll

00:22:00.150 --> 00:22:01.210
drop out right away.

00:22:01.210 --> 00:22:03.790
It'd be nice if we
had something where

00:22:03.790 --> 00:22:06.940
if somebody was trying to
play a game, they're level x,

00:22:06.940 --> 00:22:09.776
it started from that level
and kind grew out from there

00:22:09.776 --> 00:22:11.400
to try to find somebody
at least that's

00:22:11.400 --> 00:22:13.170
closest to that
level type of thing.

00:22:13.170 --> 00:22:14.480
Or maybe even that level.

00:22:14.480 --> 00:22:15.912
Maybe it's how good they are.

00:22:15.912 --> 00:22:18.120
So maybe it's average or
something like that as well.

00:22:18.120 --> 00:22:19.062
Or combination.

00:22:19.062 --> 00:22:19.770
DAN GALPIN: Yeah.

00:22:19.770 --> 00:22:23.370
So right now, you can
split up game matching

00:22:23.370 --> 00:22:25.370
by variables that are fixed.

00:22:25.370 --> 00:22:27.520
So you can say,
never match anyone

00:22:27.520 --> 00:22:30.050
who's level 1 against
someone who's level 999.

00:22:30.050 --> 00:22:32.480
But that means that
you could potentially

00:22:32.480 --> 00:22:35.580
end up in a situation
where no one gets matched.

00:22:35.580 --> 00:22:37.080
And so that's a challenge.

00:22:37.080 --> 00:22:38.745
I think for us,
adding more variables

00:22:38.745 --> 00:22:40.870
and making matchmaking
smarter is one of the things

00:22:40.870 --> 00:22:43.030
that we really are
taking to heart

00:22:43.030 --> 00:22:46.290
and are trying to
do going forward.

00:22:46.290 --> 00:22:49.330
LLOYD TULLUES: So I want to
second the frictionless sign

00:22:49.330 --> 00:22:50.440
in as well.

00:22:50.440 --> 00:22:52.970
Anything that gets our
players into the game

00:22:52.970 --> 00:22:56.650
and enjoying the content
without wall to get through

00:22:56.650 --> 00:22:58.590
is fantastic.

00:22:58.590 --> 00:23:02.050
But I also want to
add, for us, we've

00:23:02.050 --> 00:23:05.490
got so many studios
internal, external to EA.

00:23:05.490 --> 00:23:08.300
And we've got one
developer portal account

00:23:08.300 --> 00:23:10.210
to rule them all.

00:23:10.210 --> 00:23:12.330
So when we're talking
about something

00:23:12.330 --> 00:23:15.160
as trivial as adding an
achievement or adding a leader

00:23:15.160 --> 00:23:20.540
board, having to do that over
email with so many studios

00:23:20.540 --> 00:23:23.450
all vying for the
same priority, it

00:23:23.450 --> 00:23:25.590
gets very, very
difficult very quickly.

00:23:25.590 --> 00:23:27.490
So what I would
really like to see

00:23:27.490 --> 00:23:30.770
is automation tools, so that
our game teams can actually

00:23:30.770 --> 00:23:35.487
build tools into their pipeline
so they can update whatever

00:23:35.487 --> 00:23:37.112
achievement leader
board, whatever else

00:23:37.112 --> 00:23:41.152
that they have, without us
being a bottleneck to them.

00:23:41.152 --> 00:23:41.860
DAN GALPIN: Yeah.

00:23:41.860 --> 00:23:42.530
And especially
when you're trying

00:23:42.530 --> 00:23:43.900
to internationalize
all your achievements,

00:23:43.900 --> 00:23:44.720
I know that's a lot of work.

00:23:44.720 --> 00:23:47.230
I It was funny, when we were
first designing achievements,

00:23:47.230 --> 00:23:49.390
we actually had an
internal debate.

00:23:49.390 --> 00:23:51.840
And there was one side that
argued we should do everything

00:23:51.840 --> 00:23:54.970
through XML and just have you
upload things to the portal.

00:23:54.970 --> 00:23:56.349
And then the other
side was like,

00:23:56.349 --> 00:23:58.390
but that will make it
really confusing for people

00:23:58.390 --> 00:23:59.360
who are starting out.

00:23:59.360 --> 00:24:00.977
And so I think
we're at that point

00:24:00.977 --> 00:24:03.060
now where people understand
what achievements are,

00:24:03.060 --> 00:24:04.739
they understand
what they contain.

00:24:04.739 --> 00:24:07.030
And now it's time to actually
just simplify the process

00:24:07.030 --> 00:24:09.175
and make it easier for everyone.

00:24:09.175 --> 00:24:10.050
LLOYD TULLUES: Sorry.

00:24:10.050 --> 00:24:12.674
Just one other thing I wanted to
add onto with our mini studios

00:24:12.674 --> 00:24:13.720
problem.

00:24:13.720 --> 00:24:16.670
We also have a very real
issue with game teams going

00:24:16.670 --> 00:24:19.180
to look at data in the portal.

00:24:19.180 --> 00:24:22.920
And while the
portal has a number

00:24:22.920 --> 00:24:24.990
of excellent tools for
granular permissions,

00:24:24.990 --> 00:24:27.306
we want to see that fleshed
out a bit more so our game

00:24:27.306 --> 00:24:28.650
teams can log in and
look at their data,

00:24:28.650 --> 00:24:30.108
see how their games
are performing,

00:24:30.108 --> 00:24:31.732
especially in game services.

00:24:31.732 --> 00:24:32.690
DAN GALPIN: Absolutely.

00:24:32.690 --> 00:24:34.273
Yeah, that's a really
good point, too,

00:24:34.273 --> 00:24:36.860
in terms of-- game services
are kind of locked out

00:24:36.860 --> 00:24:40.040
from most people from seeing the
console, unless you're actually

00:24:40.040 --> 00:24:41.040
a registered developer.

00:24:41.040 --> 00:24:43.540
So people in support and
services can't see that stuff.

00:24:43.540 --> 00:24:45.373
So that's another thing
for us take to heart

00:24:45.373 --> 00:24:48.040
as we add more and more features
like statistics in there.

00:24:48.040 --> 00:24:49.625
Let's see.

00:24:49.625 --> 00:24:50.930
Next.

00:24:50.930 --> 00:24:51.430
Oh, OK.

00:24:51.430 --> 00:24:52.030
New features.

00:24:52.030 --> 00:24:53.571
So this is we're
talking specifically

00:24:53.571 --> 00:24:56.620
about saved games and Quests.

00:24:56.620 --> 00:24:59.170
What are you most excited about
having your teams look at?

00:24:59.170 --> 00:25:00.740
SOURABH AHUJA: So
for us, saved games

00:25:00.740 --> 00:25:02.989
is kind of an extension of
what we were already doing.

00:25:02.989 --> 00:25:05.170
So the fact that you
can have pictures and it

00:25:05.170 --> 00:25:07.500
will show up in play games,
that is pretty exciting.

00:25:07.500 --> 00:25:10.930
We saw a little glimpse of it
earlier on somebody's phone.

00:25:10.930 --> 00:25:13.130
Even more excited about Quests.

00:25:13.130 --> 00:25:15.890
We were already doing
some of it in our games,

00:25:15.890 --> 00:25:17.970
which are more social.

00:25:17.970 --> 00:25:20.020
So we're most excited
about Quests, I think,

00:25:20.020 --> 00:25:23.574
and having some
sort of coop Quests

00:25:23.574 --> 00:25:25.490
is going to be even more
useful down the line.

00:25:25.490 --> 00:25:29.569
So that, to me, looks
pretty cool right now.

00:25:29.569 --> 00:25:30.360
ARI KARDASIS: Yeah.

00:25:30.360 --> 00:25:34.770
I mean we use saved games
in "Disco Bees", which

00:25:34.770 --> 00:25:36.190
goes pretty well.

00:25:36.190 --> 00:25:39.210
Not through Google Play
game services, but we will.

00:25:39.210 --> 00:25:43.729
And in "Make it Rain", I
know that the second we

00:25:43.729 --> 00:25:45.770
start doing that, people
are going to be using it

00:25:45.770 --> 00:25:49.160
on two devices at
once, immediately.

00:25:49.160 --> 00:25:51.717
And it's going to be a
challenge to deal with that.

00:25:51.717 --> 00:25:53.300
There's a lot of
edge cases that we're

00:25:53.300 --> 00:25:54.425
going to need to deal with.

00:25:54.425 --> 00:25:55.850
So I think that
hopefully that can

00:25:55.850 --> 00:25:59.742
manage that kind of situation
for us and make it smooth.

00:25:59.742 --> 00:26:00.450
DAN GALPIN: Yeah.

00:26:00.450 --> 00:26:01.980
I think that's always
a challenge, especially

00:26:01.980 --> 00:26:03.420
in a game where there's
a chance element.

00:26:03.420 --> 00:26:05.070
And there really is a
chance element in it.

00:26:05.070 --> 00:26:06.500
Where all of a sudden,
you have people

00:26:06.500 --> 00:26:09.041
who are playing on three or four
devices, and they're saying,

00:26:09.041 --> 00:26:10.930
which one actually
does the best?

00:26:10.930 --> 00:26:12.560
So I think that is hard.

00:26:12.560 --> 00:26:16.130
And I think that unfortunately,
if you're allowing people

00:26:16.130 --> 00:26:20.310
to play offline to begin with,
there's no great solution.

00:26:20.310 --> 00:26:23.070
I think there's a number of
potential interesting solutions

00:26:23.070 --> 00:26:24.070
to that one.

00:26:24.070 --> 00:26:26.425
But definitely, how you handle
that conflict resolution

00:26:26.425 --> 00:26:27.779
is tough.

00:26:27.779 --> 00:26:30.320
GUILHERME LACHAUT: I think we're
really excited about Quests,

00:26:30.320 --> 00:26:31.230
as well.

00:26:31.230 --> 00:26:33.340
We already have time
limited events in our games.

00:26:33.340 --> 00:26:34.930
But what's interesting
about Quests

00:26:34.930 --> 00:26:37.149
is that you can set up
new Quests, of course,

00:26:37.149 --> 00:26:37.690
all the time.

00:26:37.690 --> 00:26:39.780
You can re-use them,
and you can also

00:26:39.780 --> 00:26:41.780
change the kind of rewards
that are in the game.

00:26:41.780 --> 00:26:43.363
So let's say, for
example, we're doing

00:26:43.363 --> 00:26:45.250
a time limited
event in our game.

00:26:45.250 --> 00:26:48.362
We can actually do a time
quest with achievements,

00:26:48.362 --> 00:26:50.070
unique achievements
that can be unlocked.

00:26:50.070 --> 00:26:53.780
So once again, it comes back to
using the achievement future.

00:26:53.780 --> 00:26:56.920
But you can additionally use
the Quests to further enhance

00:26:56.920 --> 00:26:59.310
this feature of the services.

00:26:59.310 --> 00:27:02.250
And for us, we think that
time limited Quests like this

00:27:02.250 --> 00:27:03.220
is really important.

00:27:03.220 --> 00:27:06.060
Once again, for
engagement with our users,

00:27:06.060 --> 00:27:09.054
just to have them
come back to the game,

00:27:09.054 --> 00:27:11.470
keep on playing and having new
challenges within the game.

00:27:11.470 --> 00:27:14.580
And we're looking forward,
also, to coop Quests,

00:27:14.580 --> 00:27:17.120
which would be very
interesting thing.

00:27:17.120 --> 00:27:20.750
DAN GALPIN: Quests to
me are just super cool.

00:27:20.750 --> 00:27:23.200
How many people in the
audience here are actually

00:27:23.200 --> 00:27:26.690
in the gaming industry,
just by a show of hands?

00:27:26.690 --> 00:27:27.610
Great.

00:27:27.610 --> 00:27:30.264
So one of the
things we've seen--

00:27:30.264 --> 00:27:31.680
and I didn't even
introduce myself

00:27:31.680 --> 00:27:32.460
at the beginning of this panel.

00:27:32.460 --> 00:27:34.370
I've actually been doing
developer relations,

00:27:34.370 --> 00:27:37.630
I've been a developer advocate
for four years here at Google.

00:27:37.630 --> 00:27:40.080
And we've watched the
industry really shift.

00:27:40.080 --> 00:27:42.300
And it started off
that we were in an era

00:27:42.300 --> 00:27:43.860
where games were
one shot things.

00:27:43.860 --> 00:27:45.985
Where people would play
them on their phone

00:27:45.985 --> 00:27:47.360
for a couple of
weeks or a month,

00:27:47.360 --> 00:27:48.776
and they'd go on
to the next game.

00:27:48.776 --> 00:27:52.550
And now we're seeing that
all of the successful games

00:27:52.550 --> 00:27:54.970
are actually really
games as services.

00:27:54.970 --> 00:27:57.170
Almost every one of them
has a life cycle and an arc

00:27:57.170 --> 00:28:00.040
and changes that are planned
over a long period of time.

00:28:00.040 --> 00:28:02.260
And one of the
challenges when you

00:28:02.260 --> 00:28:04.850
have a game that has a long
tail like that is actually

00:28:04.850 --> 00:28:08.220
keeping it live for your users
and keeping your users engaged.

00:28:08.220 --> 00:28:10.880
And so people had ops team that
would actually set up events.

00:28:10.880 --> 00:28:13.400
And they would write all
sorts of code handle that.

00:28:13.400 --> 00:28:15.480
And it really would
require a lot of resources.

00:28:15.480 --> 00:28:17.480
So when we thought
about Quest, it was,

00:28:17.480 --> 00:28:21.197
how do we keep people engaged
in a really cool way where

00:28:21.197 --> 00:28:23.030
they don't have to build
their own back end,

00:28:23.030 --> 00:28:25.120
and they don't have
to have an ops team?

00:28:25.120 --> 00:28:27.850
So for us, it was
really the next step

00:28:27.850 --> 00:28:30.420
in taking our services forward.

00:28:30.420 --> 00:28:30.920
Anyways.

00:28:30.920 --> 00:28:32.169
I just wanted to mention that.

00:28:32.169 --> 00:28:35.069
Because it's something I'm kind
of passion about, actually.

00:28:35.069 --> 00:28:35.985
KEITH PICHELMAN: Yeah.

00:28:35.985 --> 00:28:39.360
We couldn't agree more.

00:28:39.360 --> 00:28:41.780
So excited about Quests.

00:28:41.780 --> 00:28:45.730
We're always trying to
keep our users engaged,

00:28:45.730 --> 00:28:49.330
and they burn through
our content so fast.

00:28:49.330 --> 00:28:52.980
And again, for us to build
a new alley, new lane,

00:28:52.980 --> 00:28:54.990
new tournaments.

00:28:54.990 --> 00:28:58.950
We have holiday tournaments,
like a Halloween tournament,

00:28:58.950 --> 00:28:59.832
a Halloween alley.

00:28:59.832 --> 00:29:01.540
It takes a lot of time
to build that out.

00:29:01.540 --> 00:29:04.940
And what, we use it once a year.

00:29:04.940 --> 00:29:07.710
So having Quests, having
these real time events,

00:29:07.710 --> 00:29:12.970
will add a lot for our users
and keep them hopefully

00:29:12.970 --> 00:29:13.520
very engaged.

00:29:13.520 --> 00:29:15.450
And I can't wait to start
just trying them out

00:29:15.450 --> 00:29:19.320
and try out different links,
different types of Quests,

00:29:19.320 --> 00:29:21.050
and different types
of awards, and really

00:29:21.050 --> 00:29:22.350
find out what our users enjoy.

00:29:24.881 --> 00:29:27.130
LLOYD TULLUES: You said that
very well, I can't really

00:29:27.130 --> 00:29:30.870
add on to-- that's perfect.

00:29:30.870 --> 00:29:33.250
I would like to then
go back to saves,

00:29:33.250 --> 00:29:37.340
which is my second
choice, thank you.

00:29:37.340 --> 00:29:39.480
I'd like to say that the
game saves specifically

00:29:39.480 --> 00:29:43.970
because, one, or, two reasons.

00:29:43.970 --> 00:29:47.010
One, it's so easy for
us to actually save data

00:29:47.010 --> 00:29:48.140
on to the cloud.

00:29:48.140 --> 00:29:50.340
There's really not a whole
lot of work involved,

00:29:50.340 --> 00:29:53.940
and we don't have to build our
back end for saving the data.

00:29:53.940 --> 00:29:57.250
We don't have to
administer our own CDN

00:29:57.250 --> 00:29:59.290
or go through all
that rigmarole.

00:29:59.290 --> 00:30:02.560
So it alleviates a lot
of stress on our side.

00:30:02.560 --> 00:30:05.290
And then the other side, too,
is it's fantastic for our users.

00:30:05.290 --> 00:30:08.830
They know that if we
save data on game saves,

00:30:08.830 --> 00:30:11.770
on the Google Cloud,
it's very well trusted.

00:30:11.770 --> 00:30:12.420
It's there.

00:30:12.420 --> 00:30:14.582
They know that even if
they uninstall the game

00:30:14.582 --> 00:30:17.040
and come back later, their data
is still going to be there.

00:30:17.040 --> 00:30:19.590
If we do our job
right, of course.

00:30:19.590 --> 00:30:22.410
But I do like the
fact that our players

00:30:22.410 --> 00:30:24.890
have that inherent
trust in Google

00:30:24.890 --> 00:30:26.115
that we can then leverage.

00:30:26.115 --> 00:30:28.240
And of course, like I said,
it saves our developers

00:30:28.240 --> 00:30:30.320
to focus on the fun.

00:30:30.320 --> 00:30:33.370
DAN GALPIN: I think when we
envisioned Play game services,

00:30:33.370 --> 00:30:37.580
it was how to get developers
the best opportunity

00:30:37.580 --> 00:30:39.550
to focus on making
games and let us

00:30:39.550 --> 00:30:41.380
do some of the kind
of boring things,

00:30:41.380 --> 00:30:43.399
like all this back end stuff.

00:30:43.399 --> 00:30:44.940
To me, it's actually
really exciting.

00:30:44.940 --> 00:30:48.010
But I know that there are
a lot of game developers

00:30:48.010 --> 00:30:50.629
who would much rather add game
content than figure out how

00:30:50.629 --> 00:30:53.170
to handle Cloud Save and have
the server infrastructure to do

00:30:53.170 --> 00:30:53.930
that.

00:30:53.930 --> 00:30:55.779
The thing that
I'm really excited

00:30:55.779 --> 00:30:57.320
about with the new
Cloud Save feature

00:30:57.320 --> 00:31:00.630
too is that we actually
are now making them social.

00:31:00.630 --> 00:31:03.200
So other players
can actually see

00:31:03.200 --> 00:31:06.134
the snapshot of your progress
and actually kind of figure

00:31:06.134 --> 00:31:07.800
out how to compete
with you in that way.

00:31:07.800 --> 00:31:09.549
When we originally
introduced the feature,

00:31:09.549 --> 00:31:13.330
it was entirely non social.

00:31:13.330 --> 00:31:16.580
We realized, how could we have
a feature of our game service

00:31:16.580 --> 00:31:19.041
that didn't actually allow
people to be competitive?

00:31:19.041 --> 00:31:20.790
And so that was one
of the driving forces.

00:31:20.790 --> 00:31:24.480
The other thing is that everyone
said, we want bigger saves.

00:31:24.480 --> 00:31:26.660
And so I'm happy to
say the new feature

00:31:26.660 --> 00:31:28.090
allows for 3 megabyte saves.

00:31:28.090 --> 00:31:30.840
They're actually tied through
a Google Drive account.

00:31:30.840 --> 00:31:32.530
You can have multiple
saves as well.

00:31:32.530 --> 00:31:35.890
So as much space as the
user's willing to give you,

00:31:35.890 --> 00:31:37.762
you can have.

00:31:37.762 --> 00:31:39.220
I think that's
really exciting too.

00:31:39.220 --> 00:31:41.340
Especially when you think about
the scenario of all right,

00:31:41.340 --> 00:31:43.423
maybe someone's playing
the game on three devices.

00:31:43.423 --> 00:31:44.854
Well, you could do a conflict.

00:31:44.854 --> 00:31:46.270
Or you could simply
say, well here

00:31:46.270 --> 00:31:48.402
are your saves and
kind of, you know,

00:31:48.402 --> 00:31:50.020
pick which you want to go on.

00:31:50.020 --> 00:31:53.060
And that's pretty much it.

00:31:53.060 --> 00:31:57.290
So this is beyond
Play game services.

00:31:57.290 --> 00:31:59.900
And I think this is probably
the most open question.

00:31:59.900 --> 00:32:04.704
And I want to go on
this for a while.

00:32:04.704 --> 00:32:07.120
I've watched in the last four
years the business of gaming

00:32:07.120 --> 00:32:09.070
change a lot on mobile.

00:32:09.070 --> 00:32:11.400
So the question is, how
has it changed for you

00:32:11.400 --> 00:32:12.370
in the past year?

00:32:12.370 --> 00:32:15.720
What trends do you see
coming up in the future?

00:32:15.720 --> 00:32:18.380
SOURABH AHUJA: So for
us, just the sheer amount

00:32:18.380 --> 00:32:21.070
of growth and
downloads and revenue

00:32:21.070 --> 00:32:23.240
on Google Play been amazing.

00:32:23.240 --> 00:32:26.940
Like it has started to
catch up and the gap

00:32:26.940 --> 00:32:29.330
is very narrow to iOS.

00:32:29.330 --> 00:32:32.630
I'm happy that the finer
analytical minds at Glu

00:32:32.630 --> 00:32:36.650
are now looking at taking deeper
dives into Android data, which

00:32:36.650 --> 00:32:39.470
means that we're going
to be catering our games

00:32:39.470 --> 00:32:42.500
also more towards what
the Android users like.

00:32:42.500 --> 00:32:45.530
Or at least as much towards
what the Android users like.

00:32:45.530 --> 00:32:48.150
So I'm pretty happy for like--
just the growth has just

00:32:48.150 --> 00:32:52.630
been an amazing,
downloads and revenue.

00:32:52.630 --> 00:32:55.663
ARI KARDASIS: Well,
today's the 26th, right?

00:32:55.663 --> 00:32:56.510
DAN GALPIN: Yeah.

00:32:56.510 --> 00:32:59.070
ARI KARDASIS: Yesterday is the
anniversary of us setting up

00:32:59.070 --> 00:33:02.610
our first [? repo. ?] So
one year ago, "Space Inch"

00:33:02.610 --> 00:33:04.775
was just a twinkle in our eye.

00:33:04.775 --> 00:33:07.270
So happy birthday "Space Inch".

00:33:07.270 --> 00:33:09.500
But a lot has changed
in the last year.

00:33:09.500 --> 00:33:11.780
I mean we didn't release
the game until October,

00:33:11.780 --> 00:33:17.460
and our first Android game
came out in, I think, March.

00:33:17.460 --> 00:33:18.710
So it's all very new to us.

00:33:18.710 --> 00:33:22.970
And we're accumulating knowledge
and learning everything we can

00:33:22.970 --> 00:33:26.480
and really excited to engage the
old features which we haven't

00:33:26.480 --> 00:33:30.630
gotten to, as well as the new
ones which are coming up soon.

00:33:30.630 --> 00:33:33.210
DAN GALPIN: So when you look
forward in the next year.

00:33:33.210 --> 00:33:36.190
Your team has produced a
really diverse set of games

00:33:36.190 --> 00:33:37.820
in a very, very
short period of time.

00:33:37.820 --> 00:33:39.510
What are the things
that are resonating,

00:33:39.510 --> 00:33:43.240
in terms of the
games you've built?

00:33:43.240 --> 00:33:44.700
ARI KARDASIS: I
think personality

00:33:44.700 --> 00:33:47.380
is what we try to
get out of our games.

00:33:47.380 --> 00:33:50.360
I mean there's a lot of games
out there that monetize well,

00:33:50.360 --> 00:33:53.360
that have great engagement.

00:33:53.360 --> 00:33:56.762
And I think that we need a
leg up, because we're small.

00:33:56.762 --> 00:33:58.470
We don't have a big
analytics department.

00:33:58.470 --> 00:34:01.330
We don't have a big marketing
department or UA department.

00:34:01.330 --> 00:34:03.420
So we try to put a little
bit of heart and love

00:34:03.420 --> 00:34:08.060
into everything we do
and make the games cute

00:34:08.060 --> 00:34:12.150
and engaging and loveable.

00:34:12.150 --> 00:34:15.600
And I think that
without services

00:34:15.600 --> 00:34:19.441
that provide some
additional structure for us,

00:34:19.441 --> 00:34:20.940
that would never
really be possible.

00:34:20.940 --> 00:34:23.870
Because we'd have
cute and nothing else.

00:34:23.870 --> 00:34:25.332
So it gives us that leg up.

00:34:25.332 --> 00:34:26.873
DAN GALPIN: It's
super exciting to me

00:34:26.873 --> 00:34:31.469
that a company can go from
a repo-- getting created--

00:34:31.469 --> 00:34:35.360
to having three successful
games across multiple platforms

00:34:35.360 --> 00:34:36.822
in a year.

00:34:36.822 --> 00:34:38.280
I think that says
a lot about where

00:34:38.280 --> 00:34:39.654
we are in this
industry and a lot

00:34:39.654 --> 00:34:41.820
about the opportunity
that's still there.

00:34:44.544 --> 00:34:46.460
GUILHERME LACHAUT: The
real question would be,

00:34:46.460 --> 00:34:48.543
what hasn't changed in
over a year on Google Play?

00:34:48.543 --> 00:34:52.150
I mean, the story itself
changed completely.

00:34:52.150 --> 00:34:57.380
A whole new UI, new types of
collections, algorithmic base.

00:34:57.380 --> 00:35:00.780
So I would say really, like it's
great to see the Google Play

00:35:00.780 --> 00:35:01.870
store catching up.

00:35:01.870 --> 00:35:05.156
So really tremendous results in
terms of downloads and really

00:35:05.156 --> 00:35:06.780
the gap decreasing
in terms of revenue,

00:35:06.780 --> 00:35:09.160
as well, with other
key platforms.

00:35:09.160 --> 00:35:12.170
So it's been a great
2013 year and hopefully

00:35:12.170 --> 00:35:15.610
a great 2014 year
going even further.

00:35:15.610 --> 00:35:19.310
I think for us, we're really
looking into new platforms.

00:35:19.310 --> 00:35:21.440
So Android TV is
one, but we're also

00:35:21.440 --> 00:35:23.140
excited whether
Android [INAUDIBLE],

00:35:23.140 --> 00:35:24.139
with Android [? Auto ?].

00:35:24.139 --> 00:35:26.750
I mean there's so
many new ways to try

00:35:26.750 --> 00:35:30.190
to reach our users to try to
transform the user experience

00:35:30.190 --> 00:35:33.420
and to bring new values to
games that-- I mean we're really

00:35:33.420 --> 00:35:35.450
looking forward into,
once again, innovation

00:35:35.450 --> 00:35:38.395
and seeing what we can bring
to users with our games.

00:35:38.395 --> 00:35:43.680
DAN GALPIN: So as we talk
about this past year, what

00:35:43.680 --> 00:35:45.830
have you seen in
terms of Asia and it

00:35:45.830 --> 00:35:47.050
being a force in your games?

00:35:47.050 --> 00:35:49.100
I know it's one of the
challenges for game makers

00:35:49.100 --> 00:35:50.600
that are outside
of Asia is actually

00:35:50.600 --> 00:35:53.080
kind of cracking
into that market.

00:35:53.080 --> 00:35:55.294
How has that worked
for your team?

00:35:55.294 --> 00:35:57.460
GUILHERME LACHAUT: So we're
really a global company.

00:35:57.460 --> 00:35:59.250
So we do have offices
all around the world.

00:35:59.250 --> 00:36:00.958
But it's true that
when you look at Asia,

00:36:00.958 --> 00:36:02.520
it's a really specific market.

00:36:02.520 --> 00:36:04.820
It has its own customs.

00:36:04.820 --> 00:36:07.900
The users are really playing
different types of games.

00:36:07.900 --> 00:36:11.640
So as a publisher, I think for
us it's really important-- what

00:36:11.640 --> 00:36:13.820
we're trying to do is
really to adapt our offers.

00:36:13.820 --> 00:36:17.410
So content of our games,
pricing, and the way

00:36:17.410 --> 00:36:18.370
we're addressing them.

00:36:21.420 --> 00:36:23.580
We went from being
global to trying

00:36:23.580 --> 00:36:26.060
to offer the same service,
then localization,

00:36:26.060 --> 00:36:28.780
and now it's really offering
a customized experience

00:36:28.780 --> 00:36:31.290
to those kinds of markets.

00:36:31.290 --> 00:36:33.030
DAN GALPIN: Cool.

00:36:33.030 --> 00:36:33.980
KEITH PICHELMAN: Yeah.

00:36:33.980 --> 00:36:36.646
So Concrete Software, we've been
around for almost 11 years now,

00:36:36.646 --> 00:36:37.795
making mobile games.

00:36:37.795 --> 00:36:40.160
It's been quite a ride.

00:36:40.160 --> 00:36:43.440
And the biggest change it
seemed like over the long haul

00:36:43.440 --> 00:36:44.450
has been pricing.

00:36:44.450 --> 00:36:47.370
We started off, we were selling
mobile games for $20 a shot.

00:36:47.370 --> 00:36:48.956
And we got press
down, kind of went

00:36:48.956 --> 00:36:50.960
to advertising a little bit.

00:36:50.960 --> 00:36:53.660
But then, really,
this last year we

00:36:53.660 --> 00:36:56.439
had to make a fundamental
shift, where we really

00:36:56.439 --> 00:36:57.980
had to start thinking
about our games

00:36:57.980 --> 00:36:59.938
as not just being a
product to get out the door

00:36:59.938 --> 00:37:02.120
and trying to make a great
game, get a good review.

00:37:02.120 --> 00:37:04.380
But our games are now services.

00:37:04.380 --> 00:37:08.430
We really think about, when make
a game, that this is a service.

00:37:08.430 --> 00:37:10.380
And that's where
Quests will come in.

00:37:10.380 --> 00:37:13.960
Or we can add a lot more
content for our users.

00:37:13.960 --> 00:37:16.320
But yeah, this
last year-- we used

00:37:16.320 --> 00:37:19.130
to release maybe six,
seven games a year.

00:37:19.130 --> 00:37:21.220
And now, this last
year, we released one.

00:37:21.220 --> 00:37:24.930
It's really been a
challenge to make sure

00:37:24.930 --> 00:37:27.540
that we retain our users, that
we always have new content,

00:37:27.540 --> 00:37:30.400
and that we really think
more as a service company.

00:37:33.410 --> 00:37:38.510
LLOYD TULLUES: So for us, it's
really been a mindset change.

00:37:38.510 --> 00:37:41.290
If we're going to talk about
Asia just for a second,

00:37:41.290 --> 00:37:44.980
in the past-- I've been in the
industry for 13 some odd years.

00:37:44.980 --> 00:37:48.910
And when we make
a product, you go

00:37:48.910 --> 00:37:50.210
through localization efforts.

00:37:50.210 --> 00:37:52.626
You just translate everything
and you kick it out the door

00:37:52.626 --> 00:37:54.700
and you open the rest
of the world likes it.

00:37:54.700 --> 00:37:57.400
But the mindset change on
our end, specifically now,

00:37:57.400 --> 00:37:59.720
is it's not just
about localization.

00:37:59.720 --> 00:38:01.322
It's about culturalization.

00:38:01.322 --> 00:38:06.930
Taking a game and really
adapting for the Asian market

00:38:06.930 --> 00:38:09.646
in a way that resonates to them.

00:38:09.646 --> 00:38:11.270
And oftentimes, we
get a product that's

00:38:11.270 --> 00:38:15.590
very different from the one that
we have in the United States.

00:38:15.590 --> 00:38:18.090
And so that's been a very,
very big change for us.

00:38:18.090 --> 00:38:21.670
And then we've also gone through
the same learnings in terms of,

00:38:21.670 --> 00:38:26.900
you just can't go to the old
way of doing things, which

00:38:26.900 --> 00:38:29.940
was make a thing, ship
a thing, and then pray.

00:38:29.940 --> 00:38:31.900
You now make a thing,
you ship a thing,

00:38:31.900 --> 00:38:33.540
and then you keep
on building it.

00:38:33.540 --> 00:38:35.680
As you learn what
your users like,

00:38:35.680 --> 00:38:38.690
you get into the
behavioral play patterns.

00:38:38.690 --> 00:38:41.535
You see what content
they really enjoy,

00:38:41.535 --> 00:38:43.270
and you keep building on that.

00:38:43.270 --> 00:38:47.575
You just keep on making the game
better for many years on end.

00:38:47.575 --> 00:38:49.450
DAN GALPIN: So when you
guys think of a game,

00:38:49.450 --> 00:38:52.140
how many updates in the
future are you guys thinking,

00:38:52.140 --> 00:38:54.710
in terms of when you have a
game that you know is a service?

00:38:54.710 --> 00:38:56.889
How far in the future
are you thinking?

00:38:56.889 --> 00:38:57.930
LLOYD TULLUES: Very long.

00:38:57.930 --> 00:39:06.400
We will plan for years on end
for it a successful title.

00:39:06.400 --> 00:39:10.140
SOURABH AHUJA: I'll quickly
comment on Asia, too.

00:39:10.140 --> 00:39:12.582
On the culturalization
part, it is the key.

00:39:12.582 --> 00:39:14.290
We've had one or two
successes, but we've

00:39:14.290 --> 00:39:17.150
realized-- I personally
went there, too,

00:39:17.150 --> 00:39:21.080
and we partnered with companies
like [INAUDIBLE] in giving them

00:39:21.080 --> 00:39:24.860
our game engines and
letting use their expertise

00:39:24.860 --> 00:39:29.420
for the Japanese audience to
adapt to the monetizations.

00:39:29.420 --> 00:39:31.270
Like the live events,
those kind of things,

00:39:31.270 --> 00:39:32.410
which work really well.

00:39:32.410 --> 00:39:35.260
The characters, I think
that culturalization

00:39:35.260 --> 00:39:38.951
is the key to success
in Asia right now.

00:39:38.951 --> 00:39:40.950
DAN GALPIN: When you talk
about culturalization,

00:39:40.950 --> 00:39:45.130
are you talking about changes
to marketing, to game play,

00:39:45.130 --> 00:39:47.720
to just character design?

00:39:47.720 --> 00:39:49.220
How deep do you end up going?

00:39:49.220 --> 00:39:52.000
SOURABH AHUJA: We're going
pretty deep for this project

00:39:52.000 --> 00:39:54.320
with [INAUDIBLE].

00:39:54.320 --> 00:39:56.430
They really liked
our 3-D engine we

00:39:56.430 --> 00:39:58.060
had for our game
"Heroes of Destiny."

00:39:58.060 --> 00:40:01.236
And we like what they
are doing, of course.

00:40:01.236 --> 00:40:02.610
So everybody knows
how successful

00:40:02.610 --> 00:40:04.070
their games are in Japan.

00:40:04.070 --> 00:40:06.070
So we've hired
another developer.

00:40:06.070 --> 00:40:09.050
So they are working with them
for changing the monetization.

00:40:09.050 --> 00:40:10.460
They're changing
their characters

00:40:10.460 --> 00:40:12.430
to give them a
different look and feel

00:40:12.430 --> 00:40:15.050
which appeals to the
Japanese audience.

00:40:15.050 --> 00:40:15.850
The level design.

00:40:15.850 --> 00:40:16.810
Everything is changing.

00:40:16.810 --> 00:40:19.480
It's just the core engine,
the 3-D engine, is the same.

00:40:19.480 --> 00:40:21.090
But everything
else, the gameplay,

00:40:21.090 --> 00:40:22.840
is changing to suit
the Japanese audience.

00:40:22.840 --> 00:40:24.881
DAN GALPIN: I think it's
been really interesting.

00:40:24.881 --> 00:40:26.120
We've seen both directions.

00:40:26.120 --> 00:40:28.940
We've seen companies
from Asia make strides

00:40:28.940 --> 00:40:31.050
into European and US markets.

00:40:31.050 --> 00:40:34.760
And it's always been, how do we
take something we know works,

00:40:34.760 --> 00:40:38.920
in terms of a general concept,
and bring that same concept

00:40:38.920 --> 00:40:41.880
to these markets in a way
that's palatable and exciting

00:40:41.880 --> 00:40:43.214
for them?

00:40:43.214 --> 00:40:44.755
And there have been
a couple of games

00:40:44.755 --> 00:40:46.421
that have really done
that successfully.

00:40:46.421 --> 00:40:50.690
But it's hard, there's
no question about it.

00:40:50.690 --> 00:40:56.741
So in terms of game success.

00:40:56.741 --> 00:41:00.740
How do you define success
in terms of a game?

00:41:00.740 --> 00:41:04.910
SOURABH AHUJA: So keeping
users in the game.

00:41:04.910 --> 00:41:07.030
So the retention.

00:41:07.030 --> 00:41:08.230
The money follows.

00:41:08.230 --> 00:41:10.190
I mean, we can see even
from chat apps, right?

00:41:10.190 --> 00:41:13.480
If you keep users
in your app, you

00:41:13.480 --> 00:41:15.000
will get eventually paid for it.

00:41:15.000 --> 00:41:17.440
So retention is the key.

00:41:17.440 --> 00:41:20.830
There's so many apps
and games out there.

00:41:20.830 --> 00:41:23.940
Users have short attention span.

00:41:23.940 --> 00:41:26.612
Asian users have even
shorter attention span

00:41:26.612 --> 00:41:27.570
then the Western users.

00:41:27.570 --> 00:41:30.210
So it's key to keep
them entertained.

00:41:30.210 --> 00:41:31.710
Keep the updates coming.

00:41:31.710 --> 00:41:35.417
Plan out at least a year
in ahead of what content

00:41:35.417 --> 00:41:36.250
we're going to keep.

00:41:36.250 --> 00:41:38.410
Because they eat
up content fast.

00:41:38.410 --> 00:41:40.950
And then move on to the next
one if you don't give them

00:41:40.950 --> 00:41:44.860
something fast when they're
done with those three levels.

00:41:44.860 --> 00:41:47.730
Make sure you have the fourth,
fifth, sixth, ready to go.

00:41:50.115 --> 00:41:51.740
ARI KARDASIS: Well,
of our three games,

00:41:51.740 --> 00:41:54.220
they've sort of enjoyed
success in very different ways.

00:41:54.220 --> 00:41:58.210
Say the same thing was
kind of a critical hit.

00:41:58.210 --> 00:42:02.170
The Disco Bees
monetized very well.

00:42:02.170 --> 00:42:06.400
It's kind of a sturdy game
that is what you want.

00:42:06.400 --> 00:42:11.120
And Make It Rain was kind of
a runaway, viral sensation.

00:42:11.120 --> 00:42:13.050
So we don't know.

00:42:13.050 --> 00:42:16.530
In a nutshell, we
like the process

00:42:16.530 --> 00:42:18.920
of experimenting and finding
new ways to be successful.

00:42:18.920 --> 00:42:20.570
And I think that
as we go forward,

00:42:20.570 --> 00:42:23.960
we'll try to take
things from each game,

00:42:23.960 --> 00:42:27.350
combine them into
super games that

00:42:27.350 --> 00:42:30.440
are successful in
two or three ways.

00:42:30.440 --> 00:42:34.089
Yeah, it's always
different for us.

00:42:34.089 --> 00:42:35.630
GUILHERME LACHAUT:
I think longevity,

00:42:35.630 --> 00:42:37.290
when it comes to gaming.

00:42:37.290 --> 00:42:39.800
We have games like "World at
Arms" or "Order &amp; Chaos Online"

00:42:39.800 --> 00:42:41.722
that have been live for
more than two years.

00:42:41.722 --> 00:42:44.180
And we're still bringing new
content all the time to users.

00:42:44.180 --> 00:42:47.210
And seeing those
users still being

00:42:47.210 --> 00:42:48.950
focused on playing
the game every day.

00:42:48.950 --> 00:42:50.960
The retention, the
engagement in those games

00:42:50.960 --> 00:42:54.420
that are celebrating their
two plus years, anniversaries,

00:42:54.420 --> 00:42:55.300
is very impressive.

00:42:55.300 --> 00:42:57.360
And this is, I think,
what's the most interesting

00:42:57.360 --> 00:42:59.730
with the switch to
freemium is that now,

00:42:59.730 --> 00:43:05.007
not only games have
a very long life.

00:43:05.007 --> 00:43:07.340
I mean, you don't even know
now when you release a game.

00:43:07.340 --> 00:43:09.440
It could still be live in
five years with new content.

00:43:09.440 --> 00:43:11.880
So that's really what was
the thrill with the industry,

00:43:11.880 --> 00:43:14.550
is that everything
is changing so fast.

00:43:14.550 --> 00:43:16.219
And there's always
new challenges.

00:43:16.219 --> 00:43:17.760
So for us, really
longevity and being

00:43:17.760 --> 00:43:20.501
able to have our games
live after two plus years

00:43:20.501 --> 00:43:22.500
and then being able to
bring new content to them

00:43:22.500 --> 00:43:26.020
is really a sign of success.

00:43:26.020 --> 00:43:26.980
KEITH PICHELMAN: Yeah.

00:43:26.980 --> 00:43:29.410
We look at the same things,
especially early on in a game.

00:43:29.410 --> 00:43:31.215
We look for engagement
and longevity

00:43:31.215 --> 00:43:33.287
and make sure that it's
a fun game, that people

00:43:33.287 --> 00:43:34.370
are enjoying it, you know?

00:43:34.370 --> 00:43:37.235
We're looking at the reviews
and see how people react.

00:43:37.235 --> 00:43:41.110
And we do a lot of testing
and see, you know, people,

00:43:41.110 --> 00:43:42.720
do they want to play it again?

00:43:42.720 --> 00:43:45.010
Did they not put
the device down?

00:43:45.010 --> 00:43:47.249
Things like that.

00:43:47.249 --> 00:43:48.790
I would say, Concrete
Software, being

00:43:48.790 --> 00:43:52.370
that we're a smaller
company, 25 people,

00:43:52.370 --> 00:43:55.044
we are very careful
about our games.

00:43:55.044 --> 00:43:56.960
And we want to make sure
that they make money.

00:43:56.960 --> 00:44:00.390
And so we look closely
at the lifetime values.

00:44:00.390 --> 00:44:03.240
We also look at how
much time and cost

00:44:03.240 --> 00:44:05.650
that goes into
the games as well.

00:44:05.650 --> 00:44:08.500
Like "PBA Bowling Challenge",
we spend a lot of time and money

00:44:08.500 --> 00:44:11.580
keeping it up, creating new
events and things like that.

00:44:11.580 --> 00:44:14.740
Where we do have other games
that we call very successful,

00:44:14.740 --> 00:44:17.490
like our "Aces Spades"
and "Aces Gin Rummy" where

00:44:17.490 --> 00:44:19.780
we don't have to
spend a lot of time.

00:44:19.780 --> 00:44:21.700
It's actually ad based.

00:44:21.700 --> 00:44:24.220
And we keep them updated.

00:44:24.220 --> 00:44:27.500
We keep them working
on the latest devices

00:44:27.500 --> 00:44:30.870
that we don't necessarily
spend a lot of time and efforts

00:44:30.870 --> 00:44:34.490
to create live events
or things like that.

00:44:34.490 --> 00:44:36.810
DAN GALPIN: I think in the
early version of Android,

00:44:36.810 --> 00:44:39.330
the most popular-- I don't
know how many of you were back

00:44:39.330 --> 00:44:40.890
in the early days of Android.

00:44:40.890 --> 00:44:43.220
The most popular game
on Android market

00:44:43.220 --> 00:44:47.599
was actually a solitaire game.

00:44:47.599 --> 00:44:49.015
Because everyone
wanted solitaire,

00:44:49.015 --> 00:44:51.187
and it was about
50 kilobytes long.

00:44:51.187 --> 00:44:53.770
So it was a no brainer, everyone
just kept it on their device.

00:44:53.770 --> 00:44:55.770
I'm not sure how much
people actually played it,

00:44:55.770 --> 00:44:58.910
but it was on every
single person's phone.

00:44:58.910 --> 00:45:01.420
And there are
games that are just

00:45:01.420 --> 00:45:04.250
going to be perennial
things, that people are going

00:45:04.250 --> 00:45:06.870
to want to keep there, to have
that little experience all

00:45:06.870 --> 00:45:07.740
the time.

00:45:07.740 --> 00:45:09.420
Versus then there
are things that

00:45:09.420 --> 00:45:12.040
are more engaging and
require more depth.

00:45:12.040 --> 00:45:14.980
And that's a different
kind of success.

00:45:14.980 --> 00:45:16.625
LLOYD TULLUES: So
we look very heavily

00:45:16.625 --> 00:45:20.030
towards engagement and
retention metrics as well.

00:45:20.030 --> 00:45:23.190
We love creating fantastic
content for our players.

00:45:23.190 --> 00:45:28.550
And so we will look closely in
terms of what they're consuming

00:45:28.550 --> 00:45:34.080
and what they come back
to, so we build upon that.

00:45:34.080 --> 00:45:36.370
So that's one of
the big ways that we

00:45:36.370 --> 00:45:37.750
measure the success
of our games.

00:45:37.750 --> 00:45:39.910
But one of the things that
I really like looking at

00:45:39.910 --> 00:45:45.250
is the peripheral emerging
behaviors of our users outside

00:45:45.250 --> 00:45:45.750
of the game.

00:45:45.750 --> 00:45:47.570
So when they start
creating content.

00:45:47.570 --> 00:45:50.020
Like videos, or
they go on forums

00:45:50.020 --> 00:45:52.595
where they create
strategy guides, right?

00:45:52.595 --> 00:45:56.490
And they start sharing ideas
and approaches with one another.

00:45:56.490 --> 00:45:59.950
That's how we know, OK, we're
actually on to something here.

00:45:59.950 --> 00:46:02.630
And we can possibly
build on that.

00:46:02.630 --> 00:46:04.240
So that's always
very, very exciting.

00:46:04.240 --> 00:46:07.706
And then we've got other things,
but usually the rest follows.

00:46:07.706 --> 00:46:09.830
DAN GALPIN: I think one of
the most exciting things

00:46:09.830 --> 00:46:13.760
about mobile right
now is the ability

00:46:13.760 --> 00:46:17.890
to directly interact with your
players and cycle really fast.

00:46:17.890 --> 00:46:20.280
I think for me, the coolest
thing about Google Play

00:46:20.280 --> 00:46:24.920
is you can come up with
an idea, make a change,

00:46:24.920 --> 00:46:27.670
and have it out to
users within an hour.

00:46:27.670 --> 00:46:30.870
And that's crazy fast.

00:46:30.870 --> 00:46:35.690
You think about the console
era of just a few years ago.

00:46:35.690 --> 00:46:36.649
You'd finish your game.

00:46:36.649 --> 00:46:37.898
You'd send it off for testing.

00:46:37.898 --> 00:46:39.640
You would actually
get burnt into discs.

00:46:39.640 --> 00:46:41.681
A month or two months
later you would get it out.

00:46:41.681 --> 00:46:43.529
And then maybe you
could patch it later.

00:46:43.529 --> 00:46:45.570
And now we're in this
position where you can just

00:46:45.570 --> 00:46:47.220
continue to tweak and engage.

00:46:47.220 --> 00:46:49.370
And I think from a product
perspective, actually,

00:46:49.370 --> 00:46:52.225
for outside of Play
Games, it's actually

00:46:52.225 --> 00:46:54.550
Tag Manager is the one that
I'm super excited about,

00:46:54.550 --> 00:46:56.990
to be able to actually analyze
trends and then tweak games

00:46:56.990 --> 00:46:59.150
very, very, very quickly
based upon those trends.

00:46:59.150 --> 00:47:01.160
I think it's super exciting.

00:47:01.160 --> 00:47:03.270
Well, we're about out
of time for the panel.

00:47:03.270 --> 00:47:04.910
But I wanted to
give each one of you

00:47:04.910 --> 00:47:07.700
a chance to say
one last statement

00:47:07.700 --> 00:47:09.060
about the future of games.

00:47:09.060 --> 00:47:13.889
And I know I'm putting
you all on the spot here.

00:47:13.889 --> 00:47:15.180
SOURABH AHUJA: Future of games.

00:47:15.180 --> 00:47:16.530
Google Play.

00:47:16.530 --> 00:47:18.690
Keep putting GPGS in your games.

00:47:18.690 --> 00:47:22.570
I think we have
a long way to go.

00:47:22.570 --> 00:47:25.170
We're caught up a
lot, but there's still

00:47:25.170 --> 00:47:26.401
a lot of room for growth.

00:47:26.401 --> 00:47:28.900
A lot of countries which are
getting their smart phones now,

00:47:28.900 --> 00:47:30.270
and they're all going Android.

00:47:30.270 --> 00:47:31.760
So I'm happy.

00:47:31.760 --> 00:47:34.590
Things like what Dan just said
makes the iOS guys jealous,

00:47:34.590 --> 00:47:37.240
because we can turn
around things much faster.

00:47:37.240 --> 00:47:42.010
So this is the platform to be.

00:47:42.010 --> 00:47:44.080
ARI KARDASIS: I think
that, going forward,

00:47:44.080 --> 00:47:47.840
I mean at least for us is going
to be smaller, faster games

00:47:47.840 --> 00:47:50.200
that we put out in
a couple of months.

00:47:50.200 --> 00:47:53.510
And with infrastructure
from Google,

00:47:53.510 --> 00:47:57.300
we can make something
that works and monetizes

00:47:57.300 --> 00:48:00.500
and has all these features
even in a really, really short

00:48:00.500 --> 00:48:05.842
period of time, so that we
can just make a lot of games.

00:48:05.842 --> 00:48:07.675
GUILHERME LACHAUT: I
think innovation really

00:48:07.675 --> 00:48:09.120
is something we
want to focus on.

00:48:09.120 --> 00:48:12.290
Really trying to always bring
something new to the market,

00:48:12.290 --> 00:48:12.910
to users.

00:48:12.910 --> 00:48:13.960
This new experience.

00:48:13.960 --> 00:48:16.400
So I would say really for us,
it's going to be innovation.

00:48:16.400 --> 00:48:20.140
Keep on doing great days
and trying to have our users

00:48:20.140 --> 00:48:23.520
have the most fun they can.

00:48:23.520 --> 00:48:25.550
KEITH PICHELMAN: I
think building a game

00:48:25.550 --> 00:48:28.050
to last for a really long time.

00:48:28.050 --> 00:48:31.720
Looking at games
being a service.

00:48:31.720 --> 00:48:33.910
Making sure you
build infrastructure

00:48:33.910 --> 00:48:37.969
so that it's ready to be
around for 5 years, 10 years,

00:48:37.969 --> 00:48:40.260
instead of just building a
game to be around for a year

00:48:40.260 --> 00:48:43.984
is going to be huge
for the future.

00:48:43.984 --> 00:48:46.400
LLOYD TULLUES: I've been in
this industry for 13, 14 years

00:48:46.400 --> 00:48:48.470
and I absolutely love it.

00:48:48.470 --> 00:48:51.410
There's no other industry that
I can think of that innovates

00:48:51.410 --> 00:48:53.010
so quickly.

00:48:53.010 --> 00:48:55.620
And whenever anybody puts
something new and interesting

00:48:55.620 --> 00:48:59.250
out there, my thought process
is kind of put a game on it.

00:48:59.250 --> 00:49:02.092
And so, it's
phenomenally interesting.

00:49:02.092 --> 00:49:04.550
We're looking at Android TV,
we're looking a smart watches,

00:49:04.550 --> 00:49:06.290
we're looking at Google glass.

00:49:06.290 --> 00:49:10.340
It's all these interesting
platforms, you wonder,

00:49:10.340 --> 00:49:11.460
can I put a game on this?

00:49:11.460 --> 00:49:12.500
Does this make sense?

00:49:12.500 --> 00:49:14.350
Where this is going?

00:49:14.350 --> 00:49:15.830
And if it doesn't
work now, will it

00:49:15.830 --> 00:49:18.140
work two, three
years down the line?

00:49:18.140 --> 00:49:22.120
So yeah, innovation is
the name of the game here.

00:49:22.120 --> 00:49:25.620
And it's absolutely
exciting in that way.

00:49:25.620 --> 00:49:29.270
You cannot take your eye off
of what's happening around you,

00:49:29.270 --> 00:49:30.960
whether it relates
to games or not.

00:49:30.960 --> 00:49:32.100
Because who knows?

00:49:32.100 --> 00:49:37.220
Android TV and Glass and smart
watch and games on your plate

00:49:37.220 --> 00:49:39.130
might be the next big thing.

00:49:39.130 --> 00:49:39.810
Who knows?

00:49:39.810 --> 00:49:41.994
It's going to be exciting.

00:49:41.994 --> 00:49:42.910
DAN GALPIN: Thank you.

00:49:42.910 --> 00:49:45.310
I wanted to put up this
slide a little early, right?

00:49:45.310 --> 00:49:47.800
Because I wanted to make
sure you had time to see it.

00:49:47.800 --> 00:49:49.841
If you want to find out
