00:00:00.179 --> 00:00:05.160
Keg stands and paddle boards, forever associated
with inductions into well known exclusive

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:08.160
organizations, but they can get pretty brutal.

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:12.090
So why do people go through with it?

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:16.680
Hey guys Julia here for DNews.

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:18.350
Initiation rites seem as old as time.

00:00:18.350 --> 00:00:21.480
Thousands of cultures participate in some
variation of them.

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:25.699
Here in America, we often associate them with
sports teams, social groups, Greek organizations

00:00:25.699 --> 00:00:28.400
on college campuses, or the military.

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:29.880
Bullying is as old as we are too.

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:33.710
It’s when someone who is in a position of
power abuses someone beneath them.

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:36.270
Put them together and you get hazing.

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:40.210
Hazing is defined by Ramapo Journal of Law
and Society as “…any activity, required

00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:46.390
implicitly or explicitly as a condition of
initiation or continued membership in an organization,

00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:49.739
that may negatively impact the physical or
psychological well-being.”

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:52.180
Hazing…is like bullying but it’s a little
weird.

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:56.329
Here's a direct quote from a researcher, "It's
very rare for bullies to say, 'I'm going to

00:00:56.329 --> 00:00:59.899
bully you for three months, but after that
we're going to be bros,' but that's the sort

00:00:59.899 --> 00:01:01.780
of thing that happens with hazing."

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:03.420
Hazing isn’t fun, it’s not.

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:06.530
But that’s not what you might hear coming
out of the mouths of recent pledges.

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:09.530
And that’s because they’ve convinced themselves
they’re enjoying it.

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:13.630
I once had a friend in a frat, sorry he would
be mad if I said that, I should call it a

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:18.490
fraternity, who said he participated in hazing
because “shared PTSD makes you closer.”

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:19.490
What?

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:21.740
Well he’s not entirely wrong.

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:24.810
Sharing something brings people together,
whether it’s a meal, a victory, and yes,

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:25.810
even being hazed.

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:28.080
When you think of hazing you think of a few
things.

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:32.490
Drinking games and embarrassing dares, like
having intimate relations with a pig.

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:35.790
And turns out, it’s really effective in
making people want to join a group and in

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:38.640
making people really like the group their
joining.

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:42.549
Social psychology explains that hazing produces
cognitive dissonance - which is the mental

00:01:42.549 --> 00:01:45.380
stress you feel when dealing with two contradictory
beliefs.

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:49.340
Early social psychology says that pledges
try to dispel that dissonance from hazing

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:50.340
in two ways.

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:54.450
“He can convince himself that the initiation
was not very unpleasant, or he can exaggerate

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:58.290
the positive characteristics of the group
and minimize its negative aspects”.

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:02.119
And the more unpleasant the initiation is,
the less they can convince himself of the

00:02:02.119 --> 00:02:04.310
former, so they have to exaggerate the latter.

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:08.849
One famous 1959 psychology study found that
people liked the group they joined more if

00:02:08.849 --> 00:02:11.109
they did something embarrassing to get in.

00:02:11.109 --> 00:02:14.680
In this study researchers had college women
try to get into a book club.

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:18.410
Some women went through severe initiation,
some went through a mild initiation, and some

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:19.560
went through none at all.

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:23.909
But “severe” in this case was to read
obscene words out loud, and also read aloud

00:02:23.909 --> 00:02:27.879
two vivid descriptions of sexual activity
from contemporary novels.

00:02:27.879 --> 00:02:30.519
But hey it was the 50s, so that was DOWNRIGHT
SCANDALOUS.

00:02:30.519 --> 00:02:34.889
Anyway, the researchers found that those who
went through the severe initiation rated the

00:02:34.889 --> 00:02:39.439
group as significantly more attractive than
those women who went through other initiations.

00:02:39.439 --> 00:02:43.969
Basically the harder it was to get into a
group the more they claimed they liked it.

00:02:43.969 --> 00:02:47.359
And the harder the initiation, the greater
the dissonance, and the more they fight it…

00:02:47.359 --> 00:02:48.659
by liking it.

00:02:48.659 --> 00:02:52.189
So basically your brain is like “Wow this
sucks, why did I do this?

00:02:52.189 --> 00:02:55.779
You know what, this club must be really cool
to get into”.

00:02:55.779 --> 00:02:59.969
Hazing also forges these strong bonds between
pledges by wearing down their sense of individual

00:02:59.969 --> 00:03:00.969
identity.

00:03:00.969 --> 00:03:03.019
It can be physical OR psychological.

00:03:03.019 --> 00:03:06.049
Because when people in a group are faced with
a threat, they rely more on the group and

00:03:06.049 --> 00:03:08.140
look for group promoting behavior.

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:11.569
So basically you look around during something
traumatic and make sure everyone is in it

00:03:11.569 --> 00:03:12.569
together.

00:03:12.569 --> 00:03:16.139
This kind of shared trauma creates an intense
bond with other pledges and creates a distance

00:03:16.139 --> 00:03:18.980
between themselves and non-group members.

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:22.469
Basically it creates a kind of us-vs-them
mentality among pledges and the veteran members.

00:03:22.469 --> 00:03:26.579
And the experience of hazing itself, or ‘maltreatment’
at some researchers call it, makes pledges

00:03:26.579 --> 00:03:30.620
feel dependent on the group, cognitively,
socially, and emotionally.

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:33.719
Because of what they went through together,
they now depend on the group for opinions

00:03:33.719 --> 00:03:35.200
and validation.

00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:38.769
You probably won’t be surprised to learn
there are some downsides to hazing.

00:03:38.769 --> 00:03:42.389
One study published in the journal Group Dynamics:
Theory, Research, and Practice found that

00:03:42.389 --> 00:03:47.250
undergrads who went through hazing had low
self esteem, rely on peers more, don’t like

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:48.610
to be left alone.

00:03:48.610 --> 00:03:52.680
So while hazing and severe initiation might
be unpleasant and potentially dangerous, it

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:54.799
does exactly what it’s designed to do.

00:03:54.799 --> 00:04:00.609
It wears identity down, strengthens bonds
with group members, convinces you that getting

00:04:00.609 --> 00:04:05.059
abused is fun, and increases the prestige
of the team or group that you’re joining.

00:04:05.059 --> 00:04:09.180
To get a little more background on how fraternities
and sororities became a common part of college

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:14.709
life, check out this video from Test Tube
News.

00:04:14.709 --> 00:04:23.370
So have you ever been hazed?
