Hello Charles.

00:00:01.170 --> 00:00:02.140
&gt;&gt; Hi Michael.

00:00:02.140 --> 00:00:03.310
&gt;&gt; How are you today?

00:00:03.310 --> 00:00:05.030
&gt;&gt; I'm doing just fine. How are you doing?

00:00:05.030 --> 00:00:07.380
&gt;&gt; Alright. I'm a little out of practice with

00:00:07.380 --> 00:00:09.050
this lecturing thing. So, I hope this goes well.

00:00:09.050 --> 00:00:10.530
&gt;&gt; I'm absolutely sure it will.

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:14.780
&gt;&gt; So, today's lesson is continuing what you were talking about in

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:17.870
terms of Game Theory. But, I'm going to be focusing in on what happens

00:00:17.870 --> 00:00:22.700
when you are worried about making decisions. With more than one player in

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:25.500
a sequence. Which we started to get into at the end of your

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:28.370
discussion but I'm going to go, more into it.

00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:30.350
&gt;&gt; Okay. I really like the logo by the way.

00:00:30.350 --> 00:00:34.000
&gt;&gt; Thanks very much. Yeah, it's a, it's a specially game theory logo.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:35.800
&gt;&gt; I like it very much, I like it very much. I

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:39.500
will point out, however, that all sequels should be called the quickening.

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:42.600
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I was going to go with the quickening. Or

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:45.480
judgement day, but I didn't, didn't think that made any sense.

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:47.190
&gt;&gt; Hm, that's a fair point.
