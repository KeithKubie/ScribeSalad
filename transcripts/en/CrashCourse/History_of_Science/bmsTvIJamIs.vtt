00:00:05.299 --> 00:00:10.700
Scientists in the nineteenth century discovered
a lot about life and matter. But exactly what

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:17.240
kind of stuff is the human brain? That one
was—and remains—tricky.

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:21.630
The brain sciences—with experiments and
therapies tied to biological theories of the

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:26.189
body—emerged in the nineteenth century and
came into their own in the early twentieth.

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:31.320
I’m Hank Green and it’s time to look at
some… upsetting stuff.

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:39.920
[INTRO MUSIC PLAYS]

00:00:39.929 --> 00:00:45.190
People have always had theories of the mind
and psychological disorder, or “madness.”

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:50.070
Madness was often thought to be a divine punishment,
an act of possession by spirits, or the result

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:51.789
of an imbalance of the humors.

00:00:51.789 --> 00:00:56.250
Doctors and priests cared for people dealing
with mental disorders. And as capitalism took

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:59.879
off in Europe, the mentally ill were moved
from villages, where they were looked after

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:05.990
by families, to hospitals in cities—picture
Bedlam—run by a new class of professional

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:07.140
“mad doctors.”

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:11.790
But this wasn’t psychology or psychiatry
as we know it today. In fact, there really

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:17.090
wasn’t a scientific study of the human brain
or the astonishing mental activity it enables.

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:20.550
This only got going around the time of the
Industrial Revolution, with the rise of the

00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:26.610
therapeutic asylum, or mental hospital aimed
at helping—and studying—the mentally ill.

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:31.480
Doctor Philippe Pinel of the Bicêtre hospital
in Paris often gets credit for creating the

00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:37.210
modern asylum in the late 1700s by ordering
the patients to be unchained.

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:40.990
Credit should actually go to the hospital
superintendent, Jean-Baptiste Pussin—but

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:46.350
Pinel did advocate for moral treatment of
patients rather than physical restraint. And

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:51.170
his generation of asylum doctors marked the
beginning of a shift in thought from madness

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:53.130
to a medical condition of the mind.

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:57.640
But asylums and early psychiatry were only
one part of the story. Nerve doctors treated

00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:02.240
anxious private patients. And early neurology
grew from doctors examining the brains of

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:03.240
criminals.

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:09.420
Over the 1800s, proto-neuroscientists shifted
from offering moral explanations for madness

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:11.980
to material explanations tied to brains.

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:16.300
This interest in gray matter came in part
from scientists such as Francis Galton who

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:20.790
looked for explanations about human behavior
in physical bodies, and who sought to make

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:23.840
the life sciences more quantifiable and useful.

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:28.180
Unfortunately, Galton’s version of “useful”
was eugenics, or “improving” the human

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:33.340
species through selective breeding. And scientists
in the 1800s tended to blur the lines between

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:39.030
mental illness, crime, low intelligence, and
a difficult childhood. So moral explanations

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:43.940
for mental illness snuck back into medicine
via “bad brains” instead of religion.

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:48.450
Several researchers looked for connections
between the physical brain and the mind. English

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:54.540
neurologist John Hughlings Jackson, for example,
studied epilepsy and influentially argued

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:57.990
that different bodily functions are tied to
different regions of the brain.

00:02:57.990 --> 00:03:02.901
And German doctors Gustav Fritsch and Eduard
Hitzig electrically stimulated parts of the

00:03:02.901 --> 00:03:08.680
exposed brains of dogs, making their paws
twitch. This showed experimentally that specific

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:10.980
parts of the brain coordinate motor functions.

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:12.510
And then we've got a name you've heard!

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:18.620
Russian physiologist Ivan Pavlov focused on
conditioned reflexes: he taught dogs to associate

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:24.020
the sound of a metronome with being fed, causing
them to salivate when presented with the sound

00:03:24.020 --> 00:03:25.020
alone.

00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:29.360
Pavlov’s stimulus–response work became
foundational to the school of psychology called

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:34.550
behaviorism. With this approach, psychologists
focused on environmental stimuli that affect

00:03:34.550 --> 00:03:38.310
how someone behaves rather than what they’re
thinking and feeling.

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:43.710
Meanwhile, Spanish neuroscientist Santiago
Ramón y Cajal developed a method of staining

00:03:43.710 --> 00:03:49.440
brain tissue and discovered that it is made
up of—wait for it—individual cells! Just

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:50.730
like the rest of the body.

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:55.430
After much painstaking lab work, he convinced
the rest of the scientific community of this

00:03:55.430 --> 00:03:59.380
idea, called the “neuron doctrine” after
the name of the brain cell.

00:03:59.380 --> 00:04:02.860
Around this time, other researchers set up
scientific laboratories to study the workings

00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:08.220
of the human mind. BTW, we’re mostly focusing
on the mind today, but we’ll talk more about

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:10.319
the brain after World War II.

00:04:10.319 --> 00:04:15.850
German doctor Wilhelm Wundt founded the first
psychology lab, at the University of Leipzig,

00:04:15.850 --> 00:04:20.780
in 1879, establishing psychology as a discipline
separate from other sciences.

00:04:20.780 --> 00:04:25.150
Wundt’s student, British psychologist Edward
Bradford Titchener, developed a structuralist

00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:31.330
psychological theory based on Wundt’s ideas
starting in 1892. Structuralism is a philosophy

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:36.330
that tries to understand things by seeing
how their parts fit together, regardless of

00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:41.159
what they do. Titchener tried to define the
“unit elements” of consciousness, hoping

00:04:41.159 --> 00:04:44.120
to work out a periodic table for the mind.

00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:47.849
Meanwhile—heavily influenced by Charles
Darwin—American philosopher William James

00:04:47.849 --> 00:04:53.949
developed functionalism theory, writing the
Principles of Psychology in 1890. Functionalism

00:04:53.949 --> 00:04:58.189
is a philosophy that tries to understand things
by working out the purpose for them.

00:04:58.189 --> 00:05:03.240
Finally, American psychologist G. Stanley
Hall, who studied under both Wundt and James,

00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:08.659
set up the experimental psychology lab at
Johns Hopkins and went on to professionalize

00:05:08.659 --> 00:05:14.050
the whole field. He started the American Journal
of Psychology in 1887 and founded the American

00:05:14.050 --> 00:05:16.029
Psychological Association in 1892.

00:05:16.029 --> 00:05:21.680
Thus, by the early 1900s, both the scientists
studying brains and nerves, and those studying

00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:26.849
consciousness and human behavior had set up
professional labs to explore shared research

00:05:26.849 --> 00:05:27.849
questions.

00:05:27.849 --> 00:05:31.930
But the sciences of the brain and mind became
more well known due to the application of

00:05:31.930 --> 00:05:36.749
psychological theories outside of the lab.
Y’all know who I’m talking about, right?

00:05:36.749 --> 00:05:42.479
Austrian physician-turned-talk therapist-turned-controversial
philosopher Sigmund Freud became so famous

00:05:42.479 --> 00:05:46.639
that historians sometimes call the twentieth
century “the Freudian century.”

00:05:46.639 --> 00:05:51.880
To introduce him, let’s head back to 1862,
when Europe’s most famous brain doctor,

00:05:51.880 --> 00:05:57.210
Jean‑Martin Charcot, worked at Paris’s
Salpêtrière hospital, then the largest in

00:05:57.210 --> 00:05:58.210
the world.

00:05:58.210 --> 00:06:03.180
Charcot saw patients but was also a big-time
brain collector. And he realized that maybe

00:06:03.180 --> 00:06:08.819
there were other, new ideas worth trying.
His blend of brain research-plus-therapy,

00:06:08.819 --> 00:06:12.469
the clinico-anatomical method, was the basis
for Freud’s work.

00:06:12.469 --> 00:06:17.169
Charcot focused on trying to understand the
“laws” governing hysteria—which has

00:06:17.169 --> 00:06:20.469
a long, problematic history and isn’t a
disease today.

00:06:20.469 --> 00:06:25.270
But back in the nineteenth century, it was
a way of describing various problems, including

00:06:25.270 --> 00:06:30.440
loss of motor control, paralysis, unexplained
fears, fainting, emotional outbursts, and

00:06:30.440 --> 00:06:35.740
a host of other ailments. It was a diagnostic
trash can. Plus, a way to describe

00:06:35.740 --> 00:06:38.499
women with independent ideas!

00:06:38.499 --> 00:06:43.770
Charcot tried out a lot of methods: he was
one of the first users of the camera in medicine,

00:06:43.770 --> 00:06:48.479
moving toward mechanical objectivity, or trusting
instruments over human senses.

00:06:48.479 --> 00:06:54.689
A lot of his photos of hysteric patients were
lurid and super weird by today’s standards.

00:06:54.689 --> 00:07:00.249
But the point of the history of science isn’t
to prove how awesome and ethical we are today,

00:07:00.249 --> 00:07:04.060
but to understand how people in the past made
sense of their worlds.

00:07:04.060 --> 00:07:09.889
Charcot also explored mesmerism, or hypnosis.
He showed that hypnosis can cause physical

00:07:09.889 --> 00:07:16.099
symptoms, which he took to prove that hysteria
was a neurological, not a psychological illness.

00:07:16.099 --> 00:07:20.639
That is, he thought people with mental illnesses
were more likely to be affected by hypnosis

00:07:20.639 --> 00:07:23.439
because they had bad physical brains.

00:07:23.439 --> 00:07:29.630
In 1885, the young Freud attended Charcot’s
lectures on hysteria and became obsessed with

00:07:29.630 --> 00:07:30.630
mental illness.

00:07:30.630 --> 00:07:34.719
Now, it’s important to understand the halfway
position that Freud occupied in medicine.

00:07:34.719 --> 00:07:40.750
He couldn’t take an M.D. in Germany because
he was too… Jewish. Instead, he became a

00:07:40.750 --> 00:07:46.129
“nerve doctor,” treating neurasthenia,
or bad or exhausted nerves—which was the

00:07:46.129 --> 00:07:48.210
rich-person term for hysteria.

00:07:48.210 --> 00:07:52.830
But he was open to new ideas. Freud learned
a lot from Charcot. But then he found out

00:07:52.830 --> 00:07:59.059
that Josef Breuer, a senior nerve doctor in
Vienna, was using hypnosis to encourage patients

00:07:59.059 --> 00:08:01.469
to talk rather than move.

00:08:01.469 --> 00:08:05.530
Freud started working with talk therapy and
realized that many hysterical patients were

00:08:05.530 --> 00:08:10.789
smart and otherwise “normal.” And those
suffering from hysterical “paralysis”

00:08:10.789 --> 00:08:15.460
were paralyzed in ways that didn’t make
anatomical sense. He decided that hysterical

00:08:15.460 --> 00:08:18.759
paralysis was not an anatomical problem.

00:08:18.759 --> 00:08:24.800
In 1893, Breuer and Freud published Studies
on Hysteria, theorizing that mental disorders

00:08:24.800 --> 00:08:31.169
are not the result of bad biology but bad
memories, such as sexual abuse. They suggested

00:08:31.169 --> 00:08:35.950
that the best therapy was helping them recover
those memories, which were often suppressed.

00:08:35.950 --> 00:08:39.919
Breuer and Freud fell out, but from their
work together, Freud developed a new form

00:08:39.919 --> 00:08:43.880
of therapy, psychoanalysis, that caught on
worldwide.

00:08:43.880 --> 00:08:45.940
Help us out, ThoughtBubble:

00:08:45.940 --> 00:08:49.690
Psychoanalysis was based on talking about
early childhood experiences, relationships

00:08:49.690 --> 00:08:55.790
with parents, early sexual encounters, and
dreams. The couch became a therapeutic tool.

00:08:55.790 --> 00:09:01.440
And dreams became important for therapists
after Freud’s influential 1900 book, Interpretation

00:09:01.440 --> 00:09:02.470
of Dreams.

00:09:02.470 --> 00:09:06.730
Through his work listening to patients and
trying to decode their anxieties, Freud also

00:09:06.730 --> 00:09:11.810
opened up the study of sexuality—or, to
coin another big question: where do funny

00:09:11.810 --> 00:09:17.540
feelings come from? For Freud the answer was
a form of psychic energy called libido that

00:09:17.540 --> 00:09:21.040
floated around the brain and had to go somewhere.

00:09:21.040 --> 00:09:26.230
Eventually, Freud’s work led him to develop
a three-part framework for how the human mind

00:09:26.230 --> 00:09:29.029
functions and what it even is:

00:09:29.029 --> 00:09:33.730
At the bottom, there is a fairly animalistic
layer called the id or unconscious drives,

00:09:33.730 --> 00:09:35.500
deep-seated fears and desires.

00:09:35.500 --> 00:09:41.930
Above that sits the ego, or the waking, conscious
mental interface with reality. Hey, it me!

00:09:41.930 --> 00:09:47.819
And finally, metaphorically on top of the
ego sits the superego, the mind’s internalized

00:09:47.819 --> 00:09:51.860
censor and the voice of society, religion,
and moral norms.

00:09:51.860 --> 00:09:56.920
For Freud, our minds are the outcome of a
conflict between these basic desires, rational

00:09:56.920 --> 00:10:01.779
desires, and social desires. This “iceberg
theory” of consciousness—that we only

00:10:01.779 --> 00:10:07.700
understand a small part of our own minds—has
had an enormous influence on popular culture.

00:10:07.700 --> 00:10:12.829
Thanks ThoughtBubble. Freud emphasized that
this was not an anatomical model, but a medical

00:10:12.829 --> 00:10:18.750
one, intended to help therapists access their
patients’ unconsciousness, and a sociocultural

00:10:18.750 --> 00:10:23.070
one that accounted for… all of history and
religion.

00:10:23.070 --> 00:10:29.350
To Freud, civilization represses sexual and
aggressive drives, so it’s a necessary evil.

00:10:29.350 --> 00:10:33.209
But… was this sort of theorizing even still
science?

00:10:33.209 --> 00:10:39.630
Regardless, psychoanalysis blew up. And Freud
treated it as a foregone success: in 1914,

00:10:39.630 --> 00:10:44.329
he published—maybe a little prematurely—On
the History of the Psychoanalytic Movement.

00:10:44.329 --> 00:10:49.770
Something else happened in 1914: the Great
War, or World War I, broke out. Over the next

00:10:49.770 --> 00:10:53.850
four years, thousands of soldiers returned
from the front complaining of sensory and

00:10:53.850 --> 00:10:58.860
motor disorders and loss of memories, but
with no obvious physical causes.

00:10:58.860 --> 00:11:03.650
This became “shell shock,” later rethought
of as post-traumatic stress disorder. Talk

00:11:03.650 --> 00:11:08.860
therapists played a role in treating soldiers,
and psychiatrists found a steady source of

00:11:08.860 --> 00:11:09.860
patients.

00:11:09.860 --> 00:11:14.060
Freud also continued to collaborate with other
psychologists. His Swiss colleague Carl Jung

00:11:14.060 --> 00:11:19.259
invented the word association test and the
theory of the collective unconscious, or a

00:11:19.259 --> 00:11:24.860
deep part of the mind supposedly derived from
ancestral memory and myth, not individual

00:11:24.860 --> 00:11:25.860
experience.

00:11:25.860 --> 00:11:30.209
And Freudian ideas entered mainstream psychiatry
through Swiss psychiatrist Eugen Bleuler,

00:11:30.209 --> 00:11:31.880
who coined the term “schizophrenia.”

00:11:31.880 --> 00:11:38.490
The mind sciences found perhaps an even more
fertile home in industry. Advertisers including

00:11:38.490 --> 00:11:43.000
Freud’s nephew, Edward Bernays, adopted
theories of mind and behavior in order to

00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:49.670
sell consumers increasingly mass-produced
goods. And J. B. Watson—the founder of behaviorism—became

00:11:49.670 --> 00:11:51.139
an advertising executive.

00:11:51.139 --> 00:11:56.180
In a way, Freud helped sell Fords. And other
industries looked to theories of mind in order

00:11:56.180 --> 00:11:58.819
to make their organizations run more smoothly.

00:11:58.819 --> 00:12:03.920
Next time—let’s get radioactive with a
legit family of geniuses: it’s time to meet

00:12:03.920 --> 00:12:04.949
Marie Curie.
