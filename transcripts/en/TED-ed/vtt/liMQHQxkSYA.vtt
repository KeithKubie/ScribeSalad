00:00:06.153 --> 00:00:08.086
Mysteries of vernacular:

00:00:08.086 --> 00:00:09.695
X-ray,

00:00:09.695 --> 00:00:12.207
a form of electromagnetic radiation

00:00:12.207 --> 00:00:15.095
capable of penetrating solids.

00:00:15.095 --> 00:00:17.129
The word X-ray harkens back

00:00:17.129 --> 00:00:19.520
to the work of Rene Descartes,

00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:20.983
a French philosopher,

00:00:20.983 --> 00:00:22.008
mathematician,

00:00:22.008 --> 00:00:25.614
and writer in the 17th century.

00:00:25.614 --> 00:00:28.344
One of Descartes innumerable contributions

00:00:28.344 --> 00:00:29.766
to the world of numbers

00:00:29.766 --> 00:00:33.251
was the invention of a simple yet brilliant convention

00:00:33.251 --> 00:00:36.157
most people take for granted today:

00:00:36.157 --> 00:00:38.326
the representation of unknowns

00:00:38.326 --> 00:00:43.103
within an equation as X, Y, and Z.

00:00:43.103 --> 00:00:46.337
When the German scientist Wilhelm Rontgen

00:00:46.337 --> 00:00:48.283
discovered what we now call X-rays

00:00:48.283 --> 00:00:50.344
in the late 19th century,

00:00:50.344 --> 00:00:53.740
he gave them the name X-strahlen.

00:00:53.740 --> 00:00:56.334
Strahlen is German for shine,

00:00:56.334 --> 00:01:00.316
and X, of course, represented the unknown nature

00:01:00.316 --> 00:01:03.388
of the radiation Rontgen had discovered,

00:01:03.388 --> 00:01:05.620
the X-factor, so to speak.

00:01:06.434 --> 00:01:09.259
The English translation maintained the X

00:01:09.259 --> 00:01:12.917
but replaced the German shine with ray,

00:01:12.917 --> 00:01:15.574
meaning a beam of light.

00:01:15.574 --> 00:01:17.788
Coincidentally, in mathematics,

00:01:17.788 --> 00:01:19.846
the word ray refers to a line

00:01:19.846 --> 00:01:22.721
with a point of origin that has no end

00:01:22.721 --> 00:01:25.033
and extends to infinity,

00:01:25.033 --> 00:01:27.976
bringing us neatly back to the unknown.

00:01:27.976 --> 00:01:31.794
Today we understand what X-radiation is,

00:01:31.794 --> 00:01:33.751
and in spite of the humble objections

00:01:33.751 --> 00:01:35.385
of its discoverer,

00:01:35.385 --> 00:01:39.158
it is also commonly called Rontgen Radiation,

00:01:39.158 --> 00:01:40.899
eliminating with the X

00:01:40.899 --> 00:01:43.941
the fundamental mystery of its nature.
