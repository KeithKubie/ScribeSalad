AS WE GO TO OUR NEXT GAME,
"TERMS OF ENSEARCHMENT."

00:00:08.041 --> 00:00:09.476
WHEN YOU SEARCH FOR SOMETHING ON
THE INTERNET, YOU NEVER KNOW

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:10.677
WHAT YOU'RE GOING TO FIND.

00:00:10.711 --> 00:00:11.945
SOMETIMES YOU GET A COOL FACT,
LIKE HOW PLUTO IS THE SIZE OF

00:00:11.979 --> 00:00:13.180
AUSTRALIA.

00:00:13.213 --> 00:00:15.449
SOMETIMES YOU GET A VIDEO OF A
CORGI LIP SYNCING THE "SAVED BY

00:00:15.482 --> 00:00:18.952
THE BELL" THEME, AND THEN YOU'RE
IN A BAD MOOD FOR THE REST OF

00:00:18.986 --> 00:00:20.654
YOUR LIFE.

00:00:20.687 --> 00:00:21.855
COMEDIANS, GET YOUR BUZZER
FINGERS READY.

00:00:21.889 --> 00:00:23.290

SKYNET, AND I WANT YOU TO TELL

00:00:24.758 --> 00:00:25.926
FIND IT.

00:00:25.959 --> 00:00:29.696
BUT ONLY THE FIRST PERSON TO
BUZZ IN GETS TO ANSWER, AND THE

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:33.367

00:01:08.135 --> 00:01:12.606
&gt;&gt; WHAT'S SCOTT WEILAND BEEN UP
TO?

00:01:12.639 --> 00:01:14.808
