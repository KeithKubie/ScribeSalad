00:00:06.160 --> 00:00:10.700
-OK, welcome back.

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:15.030
So for those of you who
have come in recently,

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:19.860
this is our inaugural event of
the next in science program.

00:00:19.860 --> 00:00:23.250
The idea is, at least
from my perspective,

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:26.790
that a lot of the interesting
new science in emerging areas

00:00:26.790 --> 00:00:29.550
come when we look
across disciplines,

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:32.159
when there's interdisciplinary
work being done.

00:00:32.159 --> 00:00:34.220
And typically early
career scientists

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:36.680
are the ones that are
leading the charge.

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:42.000
So the philosophy was to bring
in early career scientists

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.240
to talk to a broad
audience, and each other,

00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:49.590
for that matter, to help
enlighten us at Harvard

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:51.470
and the general public
about what might be

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:53.390
the new frontiers of science.

00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:57.160
So we had two speakers in the
first session, one talking

00:00:57.160 --> 00:01:01.000
about living
approaches to building

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:06.140
defensible shorelines and
one about sound communication

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:08.660
between whales and fish.

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:14.350
And now we're turning to a talk
on the origins of Earth's water

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:17.870
by Lydia Hallis who is
a Marie Curie research

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:20.520
fellow at the School
of Geographical

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:23.720
and earth sciences at the
University of Glasgow.

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:27.780
And she did post doctoral work
at the University of Hawaii

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:35.060
at Manoa and did her doctoral
work at the Natural History

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:37.040
Museum in London.

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:40.960
And before the break, we were
talking about the question,

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:42.340
how do we know that?

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:46.330
And this is one of these
issues where I frequently

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:50.650
come across things that I was
taught as a boy in science

00:01:50.650 --> 00:01:53.870
class and I just, sort
of, repeated it verbatim

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:56.960
as if it's always true, but
not asking the question,

00:01:56.960 --> 00:01:58.950
how do we really
know what it is?

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:01.620
And so one of the interesting
things for me was I

00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:04.060
came across an article
she had published

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:06.950
on the origins of
water on Earth.

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:10.009
And I had seen repeated
many, many times that it

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:11.654
was from comets
smashing into the Earth

00:02:11.654 --> 00:02:13.320
and that's where all
the water came from

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:18.580
and I took that as an article of
faith until I read her article.

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:24.170
And so I'm fascinated to
actually see this in person

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:27.762
and get asked
questions so, Lydia.

00:02:27.762 --> 00:02:28.262
-Hi.

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:33.330
Afternoon, everybody.

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:36.330
Yes, so now for something
completely different.

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:39.030
I'm going to be talking about
where Earth's water actually

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:40.550
came from.

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:42.560
This is not a study
that I've done on my own

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:45.660
in any way, shape or form.

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:49.460
I worked at the University
of Hawaii NASA Astrobiology

00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:54.300
Institute for four years before
I came to Glasgow in 2014.

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:58.080
And that institute had been
set up for 10 years prior

00:02:58.080 --> 00:02:59.770
to me even arriving.

00:02:59.770 --> 00:03:03.090
And they had this big
question to answer, where

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:05.470
did Earth's water come from?

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:09.310
And, really, it was all
about solar system formation,

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:11.980
and looking at water on
different planetary bodies,

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:14.070
and trying to
figure out why Earth

00:03:14.070 --> 00:03:19.530
is this really habitable and
nice place for us to live.

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:24.910
So, the big questions were
did Earth form with water,

00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:26.550
or was water added later?

00:03:26.550 --> 00:03:28.260
So this is the
cometary argument.

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:32.350
Did we get our water
from comets that

00:03:32.350 --> 00:03:34.475
are generated in the
outer solar system

00:03:34.475 --> 00:03:36.870
and come in and collide
with the early Earth?

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:40.080
Or did Earth form wets
from building blocks

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:42.450
that contained water initially?

00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:46.200
These could have been water
which asteroids, for example.

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:50.020
Where did these building blocks
come from, is another question.

00:03:50.020 --> 00:03:52.310
So, were they are
likely to be water rich?

00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:54.740
Where abouts in the solar
system did they come from?

00:03:54.740 --> 00:03:56.040
The outer solar system?

00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:58.010
The inner solar system?

00:03:58.010 --> 00:04:01.220
Is our material that
the Earth is made from

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:03.540
formed close to
home, or did it come

00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:07.040
in from the outer solar system
because of the chaotic nature

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:09.400
of the early solar system?

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:12.400
How much water
does Earth contain?

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:14.670
That seems like a
really simple question

00:04:14.670 --> 00:04:16.250
because it's very
easy for us to add

00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:19.040
up the volume of the
oceans on the surface,

00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:21.070
and the volume of the
rivers and the lakes,

00:04:21.070 --> 00:04:23.290
and the amount of water
that's in the atmosphere

00:04:23.290 --> 00:04:26.500
and say this is how
much water is contained.

00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:29.430
It's counter-intuitive
as a non-geologist, which

00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:32.420
I assume a lot of you are,
to think that rocks actually

00:04:32.420 --> 00:04:34.300
contain a lot of water.

00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:37.410
But there's more water present
beneath the Earth's surface

00:04:37.410 --> 00:04:40.470
by far than there is present
on the surface of the Earth

00:04:40.470 --> 00:04:42.330
and in the atmosphere.

00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:44.800
We don't know very much
about how much that

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:49.950
is, there are estimates that
vary between something like six

00:04:49.950 --> 00:04:53.360
oceans worth of water
beneath our feet to,

00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:55.890
I think it goes to
about 20 at the moment,

00:04:55.890 --> 00:04:59.670
but it varies all the time.

00:04:59.670 --> 00:05:02.200
And the last question
was, well, now

00:05:02.200 --> 00:05:05.070
the last question is does
Earth have more water

00:05:05.070 --> 00:05:06.460
than other terrestrial planets?

00:05:06.460 --> 00:05:08.650
I think when the
Institute was first

00:05:08.650 --> 00:05:11.200
set up that question
would have been

00:05:11.200 --> 00:05:14.250
why does Earth have more water
than the other terrestrial

00:05:14.250 --> 00:05:14.750
planets.

00:05:14.750 --> 00:05:18.760
But the more and more we looked
into the amount of water that

00:05:18.760 --> 00:05:20.580
can be present in
the deep Earth,

00:05:20.580 --> 00:05:23.600
the more we realized that that
might not actually be true

00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:25.630
and that Earth and the
other terrestrial planets

00:05:25.630 --> 00:05:30.230
may have very similar
amounts of water.

00:05:30.230 --> 00:05:32.500
OK, so all of
these questions can

00:05:32.500 --> 00:05:35.270
be answered, or at
least in part answered,

00:05:35.270 --> 00:05:39.980
by the study of hydrogen isotope
ratios and water abundancies

00:05:39.980 --> 00:05:41.620
in Earth's primitive mantle.

00:05:41.620 --> 00:05:46.590
So this would be a area in the
deep Earth that is chemically

00:05:46.590 --> 00:05:50.830
the same as the material that
the Earth formed from 4 and 1/2

00:05:50.830 --> 00:05:51.930
billion years ago.

00:05:51.930 --> 00:05:54.620
Nothing's happened to
it, nothing has changed,

00:05:54.620 --> 00:05:57.710
no surface processes have
affected this material.

00:05:57.710 --> 00:06:01.140
We call it primitive mantle.

00:06:01.140 --> 00:06:04.980
So this is where I have to get
into hydrogen isotope ratios.

00:06:04.980 --> 00:06:07.910
Please don't fall
asleep, because it

00:06:07.910 --> 00:06:10.320
does get quite geochemical,
but I'll try and, sort of,

00:06:10.320 --> 00:06:13.460
reduce most of the geochemistry.

00:06:13.460 --> 00:06:16.930
So there are two types of
hydrogen, the two flavors

00:06:16.930 --> 00:06:20.360
of hydrogen. The normal
hydrogen isotope has

00:06:20.360 --> 00:06:21.520
an atomic mass of one.

00:06:21.520 --> 00:06:24.430
That's normal hydrogen
that's in the air, in water,

00:06:24.430 --> 00:06:26.970
and most of the time on Earth.

00:06:26.970 --> 00:06:30.140
Then there's the
other hydrogen isotope

00:06:30.140 --> 00:06:31.660
which we call deuterium.

00:06:31.660 --> 00:06:34.360
So the symbol for
it is D. It just

00:06:34.360 --> 00:06:38.060
has an extra neutron
in its atomic nucleus.

00:06:38.060 --> 00:06:41.060
So it has an atomic mass of two.

00:06:41.060 --> 00:06:44.360
Comparing the D and H ratio
of different planetary bodies

00:06:44.360 --> 00:06:47.290
can indicate the
origin of these bodies.

00:06:47.290 --> 00:06:49.920
For example, whether they came
from the inner solar system,

00:06:49.920 --> 00:06:52.900
or whether they came from
the outer solar system.

00:06:52.900 --> 00:06:55.630
And in very general
terms, we can explain this

00:06:55.630 --> 00:06:58.590
if we look at how the
solar system formed.

00:06:58.590 --> 00:07:01.490
So before the sun
formed, we have what's

00:07:01.490 --> 00:07:02.830
called the molecular cloud.

00:07:02.830 --> 00:07:04.560
And this is all of
the dust and gas

00:07:04.560 --> 00:07:08.270
that later went on to form
the planets and the sun.

00:07:08.270 --> 00:07:11.900
In this molecular cloud there
is water already as a molecule.

00:07:11.900 --> 00:07:14.440
And the water is
very deuterium rich,

00:07:14.440 --> 00:07:18.330
so it has a lot of the
heavier hydrogen isotope.

00:07:18.330 --> 00:07:24.130
When the sun forms, because the
inner solar system becomes hot,

00:07:24.130 --> 00:07:28.460
this water interacts with
molecular hydrogen, so hydrogen

00:07:28.460 --> 00:07:32.250
gas, H2, which has
a low DH ratio.

00:07:32.250 --> 00:07:35.750
So that means it has a lot of
the lighter hydrogen isotope.

00:07:35.750 --> 00:07:38.290
And this interaction
means that the water then

00:07:38.290 --> 00:07:41.970
becomes rich in the
lighter hydrogen isotope,

00:07:41.970 --> 00:07:44.260
it has a low DH ratio.

00:07:44.260 --> 00:07:46.320
In the outer solar
system, because it's still

00:07:46.320 --> 00:07:52.470
cold in this region of the
outer disk, in this area here,

00:07:52.470 --> 00:07:53.900
you don't get that reaction.

00:07:53.900 --> 00:07:56.380
Because it's cold, it's
really cold out there.

00:07:56.380 --> 00:07:59.760
So the reaction either doesn't
happen, or it's very sluggish.

00:07:59.760 --> 00:08:02.680
So not much of the water
of the molecular cloud

00:08:02.680 --> 00:08:04.870
will interact with hydrogen gas.

00:08:04.870 --> 00:08:09.290
Therefore, you get the DH
ratio of the molecular cloud

00:08:09.290 --> 00:08:11.560
in the outer solar
system still to this day.

00:08:11.560 --> 00:08:15.070
Which means that
right now, in general,

00:08:15.070 --> 00:08:21.440
the closer that you are to the
sun, the lower the DH ratio,

00:08:21.440 --> 00:08:24.870
so the more light
hydrogen you have.

00:08:24.870 --> 00:08:27.300
The further out you go,
the more the deuterium

00:08:27.300 --> 00:08:30.270
you have, so the
higher the DH ratio.

00:08:33.940 --> 00:08:37.340
OK, in terms of notation, to
make that a little bit simpler,

00:08:37.340 --> 00:08:41.659
we use delta D. So we stop
talking about DH ratios

00:08:41.659 --> 00:08:44.380
and we just use
units of delta D.

00:08:44.380 --> 00:08:46.900
To make things simple we
standardize everything

00:08:46.900 --> 00:08:49.080
to Earth's ocean water.

00:08:49.080 --> 00:08:51.480
So Vienna Standard
Mean Ocean Water there,

00:08:51.480 --> 00:08:55.720
which is VSMOW we call it,
has a delta D value of zero.

00:08:55.720 --> 00:08:58.580
And everything is
compared to ocean water.

00:08:58.580 --> 00:09:01.620
So anything with a
positive delta D value

00:09:01.620 --> 00:09:04.830
is richer in deuterium
than ocean water.

00:09:04.830 --> 00:09:08.100
And anything with a
negative delta D value

00:09:08.100 --> 00:09:11.440
is richer in the lighter
hydrogen isotope.

00:09:11.440 --> 00:09:13.220
So it's poorer in deuterium.

00:09:13.220 --> 00:09:15.310
So, for example, on
Earth ice and rocks

00:09:15.310 --> 00:09:17.510
tend to have negative
delta D values

00:09:17.510 --> 00:09:20.080
because they preferentially
incorporate the lighter

00:09:20.080 --> 00:09:23.010
hydrogen isotope.

00:09:23.010 --> 00:09:25.140
This gets a little
bit more complicated

00:09:25.140 --> 00:09:30.040
because hydrogen isn't a
normal isotopic system.

00:09:30.040 --> 00:09:32.990
Deuterium has twice the
atomic mass of hydrogen,

00:09:32.990 --> 00:09:36.090
and that doesn't happen in
any other isotopic system.

00:09:36.090 --> 00:09:38.370
It means that the mass
difference between the two

00:09:38.370 --> 00:09:41.800
isotopes is very large, so
you get a very large effect

00:09:41.800 --> 00:09:44.270
when you melt something,
when you freeze something,

00:09:44.270 --> 00:09:46.080
or when you evaporate something.

00:09:46.080 --> 00:09:48.760
They separate from
each other very easily.

00:09:48.760 --> 00:09:51.290
So it means that when
you freeze something

00:09:51.290 --> 00:09:54.020
you can get a preferential
incorporation of the lighter

00:09:54.020 --> 00:09:57.930
hydrogen isotopes, but also
when you evaporate water

00:09:57.930 --> 00:10:00.050
from the oceans
into the atmosphere

00:10:00.050 --> 00:10:03.580
you also get the preferential
incorporation of the lighter

00:10:03.580 --> 00:10:04.680
hydrogen isotope.

00:10:04.680 --> 00:10:06.986
Because it's lighter so
it evaporates easier,

00:10:06.986 --> 00:10:08.610
so you get more of
the lighter hydrogen

00:10:08.610 --> 00:10:09.693
isotope in the atmosphere.

00:10:13.780 --> 00:10:16.040
To complicate
matters further, we

00:10:16.040 --> 00:10:19.810
have something called
genes or thermal escape

00:10:19.810 --> 00:10:21.980
in the upper layers
of our atmosphere.

00:10:21.980 --> 00:10:24.370
This happens on all
planetary bodies.

00:10:24.370 --> 00:10:27.440
And what it means is that
because the lighter hydrogen

00:10:27.440 --> 00:10:30.940
isotope is only half
the mass of deuterium,

00:10:30.940 --> 00:10:34.130
it takes much less
energy for that atom

00:10:34.130 --> 00:10:36.050
to reach it's escape velocity.

00:10:36.050 --> 00:10:39.270
So when high energy particles
come into the upper atmosphere

00:10:39.270 --> 00:10:42.040
such as solar wind,
cosmic rays, and they

00:10:42.040 --> 00:10:45.400
hit one of these atoms, the
lighter hydrogen isotope

00:10:45.400 --> 00:10:48.840
can much easier be blasted
off and lost to space

00:10:48.840 --> 00:10:50.340
than deuterium.

00:10:50.340 --> 00:10:52.600
And so what happens
over geological time,

00:10:52.600 --> 00:10:54.950
over these 4 and 1/2 billion
years the Earth has been

00:10:54.950 --> 00:10:57.360
around, is that
we preferentially

00:10:57.360 --> 00:11:00.070
lose the hydrogen
isotope and the DH

00:11:00.070 --> 00:11:03.570
ratio will go up over time.

00:11:03.570 --> 00:11:07.690
So this is really, really
well demonstrated by Mars.

00:11:07.690 --> 00:11:10.450
So I'm going to move away
from the Earth for a second.

00:11:10.450 --> 00:11:14.650
Mars' atmosphere is very,
very deuterium enriched.

00:11:14.650 --> 00:11:17.140
And the reason for
that is because Earth

00:11:17.140 --> 00:11:19.850
has a magnetic field, a
global magnetic field, that

00:11:19.850 --> 00:11:22.784
protects us from a lot of
the radiation from the sun

00:11:22.784 --> 00:11:25.200
and a lot of the solar wind
stripping that would otherwise

00:11:25.200 --> 00:11:26.300
occur.

00:11:26.300 --> 00:11:30.530
Mars did have a global
magnetic field until around 4

00:11:30.530 --> 00:11:35.420
billion years ago, and then the
global magnetic field stopped.

00:11:35.420 --> 00:11:38.140
That's another question
as to why that happened.

00:11:38.140 --> 00:11:40.030
But it disappeared of
four billion years.

00:11:40.030 --> 00:11:42.320
And since then
Mars' atmosphere has

00:11:42.320 --> 00:11:44.560
been exposed to the
solar wind, and it's

00:11:44.560 --> 00:11:46.850
been slowly stripped away.

00:11:46.850 --> 00:11:49.420
Deuterium and hydrogen
have been stripped away

00:11:49.420 --> 00:11:50.260
at different rates.

00:11:50.260 --> 00:11:53.180
And so we have this
value of plus 2000

00:11:53.180 --> 00:11:57.830
to plus 8000 in Mars' atmosphere
at the moment because deuterium

00:11:57.830 --> 00:12:01.360
has been left behind and
the lighter hydrogen isotope

00:12:01.360 --> 00:12:03.980
has been preferentially
stripped away.

00:12:03.980 --> 00:12:05.950
Just because Earth
has a magnetic field

00:12:05.950 --> 00:12:07.760
doesn't mean this hasn't
happened on Earth,

00:12:07.760 --> 00:12:11.950
it just means the
process isn't so extreme.

00:12:11.950 --> 00:12:15.670
So the bottom line is
changes in the DH ratio

00:12:15.670 --> 00:12:18.070
via atmospheric and
surface processes

00:12:18.070 --> 00:12:20.650
mean we can't rely
on any surface

00:12:20.650 --> 00:12:23.910
water, or any
upper mantle water,

00:12:23.910 --> 00:12:27.470
really, on Earth to give us
the original hydrogen isotope

00:12:27.470 --> 00:12:29.840
ratio of Earth.

00:12:29.840 --> 00:12:32.660
We must go deeper
into the mantle.

00:12:32.660 --> 00:12:35.230
So, as I just mentioned,
Earth is complicated

00:12:35.230 --> 00:12:37.970
because we do have
plate tectonics.

00:12:37.970 --> 00:12:41.320
No other body in the solar
system has plate tectonics.

00:12:41.320 --> 00:12:43.510
On Mars you have a static crust.

00:12:43.510 --> 00:12:47.440
So the atmosphere and the
mantle are completely separated.

00:12:47.440 --> 00:12:51.250
And if you measure the DH
ratio in a Martian meteorite,

00:12:51.250 --> 00:12:53.180
in water trapped in
a Martian meteorite,

00:12:53.180 --> 00:12:57.050
it's low, different to
the atmosphere completely.

00:12:57.050 --> 00:12:59.840
On Earth, because
you've got this mixing

00:12:59.840 --> 00:13:02.020
of subducted plates,
you potentially

00:13:02.020 --> 00:13:05.030
have ocean water and
sediment mixing down

00:13:05.030 --> 00:13:08.030
into the upper mantle and
possibly parts of the deeper

00:13:08.030 --> 00:13:09.360
mantle.

00:13:09.360 --> 00:13:13.170
You can't rely on any mantle
material, or any normal rock,

00:13:13.170 --> 00:13:15.370
to give you the
original signature,

00:13:15.370 --> 00:13:19.172
the primitive hydrogen
isotope signature of Earth.

00:13:19.172 --> 00:13:21.380
We have to go even deeper
down than the upper mantle.

00:13:25.100 --> 00:13:28.380
Rock samples from
the deepest areas

00:13:28.380 --> 00:13:30.460
that are exposed
on the surface are

00:13:30.460 --> 00:13:33.420
found in Hawaii,
Iceland, Baffin Island,

00:13:33.420 --> 00:13:36.840
all these hot spot
volcano environments.

00:13:36.840 --> 00:13:39.610
The Galapagos and
the Canary Islands

00:13:39.610 --> 00:13:42.230
are two of the good examples.

00:13:42.230 --> 00:13:45.700
And they come from what
are known as plumes,

00:13:45.700 --> 00:13:47.490
the hot spots on the surface.

00:13:47.490 --> 00:13:51.050
This plume material is thought
to come from the core mantle

00:13:51.050 --> 00:13:51.720
boundary.

00:13:51.720 --> 00:13:54.970
So this is the core
here, the mantle in red,

00:13:54.970 --> 00:13:57.070
and this plume material
comes up all the way

00:13:57.070 --> 00:13:58.670
from the core mantle boundary.

00:13:58.670 --> 00:14:00.570
So that's thousands
of kilometers.

00:14:00.570 --> 00:14:04.380
This material comes up to the
surface, is erupted as lava,

00:14:04.380 --> 00:14:09.150
solidifies into rock, and
hopefully traps its chemistry,

00:14:09.150 --> 00:14:11.510
the chemistry from down
here, at this surface for us

00:14:11.510 --> 00:14:13.510
to go and sample and pick
up and have a look at.

00:14:16.020 --> 00:14:19.000
So that is what we aim to do.

00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:20.670
The first samples
that we looked up

00:14:20.670 --> 00:14:25.480
with from Baffin Island, a
place called Padloping Island.

00:14:25.480 --> 00:14:26.940
So this is Padloping
Island, it's

00:14:26.940 --> 00:14:33.010
only a few kilometers across,
the cliff edges all along here.

00:14:33.010 --> 00:14:35.970
The samples were
collected in 1985

00:14:35.970 --> 00:14:41.000
by Professor Don Francis at
McGill University in Montreal.

00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:45.170
And they were collected from
this Northern area here.

00:14:45.170 --> 00:14:46.670
When he collected
the samples he had

00:14:46.670 --> 00:14:50.279
no idea how geochemically
special they were,

00:14:50.279 --> 00:14:51.820
but in the interim
years they've been

00:14:51.820 --> 00:14:53.820
really intensively studied.

00:14:53.820 --> 00:14:55.380
And it's found that
they are actually

00:14:55.380 --> 00:14:58.220
quite unique sample set.

00:14:58.220 --> 00:15:02.370
For example, they contain the
highest helium isotope ratios

00:15:02.370 --> 00:15:05.290
ever measured in
a sample on Earth.

00:15:05.290 --> 00:15:09.290
I'm not going to go into
helium isotopic ratios.

00:15:09.290 --> 00:15:12.680
But, basically, if you have
a high helium isotope ratio,

00:15:12.680 --> 00:15:16.630
it means that your sample
has been undegassed,

00:15:16.630 --> 00:15:20.100
has been undisturbed
since the formation

00:15:20.100 --> 00:15:24.060
or the beginning of the Earth.

00:15:24.060 --> 00:15:30.030
Similarly we have
lead isotopes that

00:15:30.030 --> 00:15:33.365
show an ancient
undisturbed mantle source.

00:15:33.365 --> 00:15:36.480
So we know that this
source of this plume

00:15:36.480 --> 00:15:40.140
has been untouched
by any mantle mixing,

00:15:40.140 --> 00:15:42.520
by any mixing of
different sources down

00:15:42.520 --> 00:15:48.050
in the deep mantle, for
4.55 to 4.45 billion years.

00:15:48.050 --> 00:15:50.960
So that's almost the
age of the Earth.

00:15:50.960 --> 00:15:53.430
It's around about the
age that the moon formed

00:15:53.430 --> 00:15:56.880
on the Earth, the giant impact.

00:15:56.880 --> 00:15:59.530
The other special thing about
these Padloping Island samples

00:15:59.530 --> 00:16:03.630
is, because we're trying to
measure hydrogen inside a rock,

00:16:03.630 --> 00:16:06.380
we want the hydrogen
to still be in there.

00:16:06.380 --> 00:16:09.370
We don't want the lava to
erupt, and degas, and lose

00:16:09.370 --> 00:16:11.980
lots of steam as it erupts.

00:16:11.980 --> 00:16:14.680
So it needs to be
erupted under pressure.

00:16:14.680 --> 00:16:18.630
So these rocks were erupted
around about 60,000 years ago

00:16:18.630 --> 00:16:22.920
under water, under seawater,
deep down under the sea.

00:16:22.920 --> 00:16:24.740
So they erupted
under pressure, which

00:16:24.740 --> 00:16:28.430
means that the gases that are
in those rocks can't escape.

00:16:28.430 --> 00:16:30.620
They're trapped.

00:16:30.620 --> 00:16:33.540
The things we actually
measured in the samples

00:16:33.540 --> 00:16:35.580
were glassy melt inclusions.

00:16:35.580 --> 00:16:41.050
So these are electron microscope
images of some of the samples.

00:16:41.050 --> 00:16:44.290
These dark gray crystals you can
see here are olivine crystals.

00:16:44.290 --> 00:16:47.770
That's a really common
mineral in lots of types

00:16:47.770 --> 00:16:50.150
of rock in the ocean crust.

00:16:50.150 --> 00:16:53.177
Generally on the Earth olivine
is a very common mineral.

00:16:53.177 --> 00:16:55.260
But, the great thing about
olivine is that it does

00:16:55.260 --> 00:16:58.170
tend to trap these, what
are called, melt inclusions.

00:16:58.170 --> 00:17:02.530
They're basically little,
tiny pockets of lava

00:17:02.530 --> 00:17:05.700
that gets trapped as
the crystals forming

00:17:05.700 --> 00:17:08.990
and the composition of
that lava is then trapped

00:17:08.990 --> 00:17:11.210
as it was before
crystallization.

00:17:11.210 --> 00:17:15.290
So you've got a sample
there of the melt

00:17:15.290 --> 00:17:18.521
as it came from the deep mantle.

00:17:18.521 --> 00:17:20.270
The great thing about
the olivine crystal,

00:17:20.270 --> 00:17:22.589
as well, is, as I
mentioned, these samples

00:17:22.589 --> 00:17:25.260
have been on the surface
for 60,000 years.

00:17:25.260 --> 00:17:28.870
Rain water, ice, at
Baffin Island sea water,

00:17:28.870 --> 00:17:31.580
can get to that
glass if it's not

00:17:31.580 --> 00:17:33.190
protected by these crystals.

00:17:33.190 --> 00:17:35.970
But the crystals are
protecting the glass.

00:17:35.970 --> 00:17:39.750
And it's very easy to see
whether an olivine crystal has

00:17:39.750 --> 00:17:43.060
been weathered to something
like a clay, in which case

00:17:43.060 --> 00:17:43.960
we would avoid it.

00:17:43.960 --> 00:17:46.100
These are pristine
olivine samples

00:17:46.100 --> 00:17:48.070
that haven't been
weathered at all,

00:17:48.070 --> 00:17:51.360
so we know that rainwater
hasn't got into the glass

00:17:51.360 --> 00:17:54.910
and contaminated what
we're trying to look for.

00:17:54.910 --> 00:17:59.140
We also looked at
samples from Iceland,

00:17:59.140 --> 00:18:01.640
very similar type of samples.

00:18:01.640 --> 00:18:04.220
Again, the high
helium isotope ratios

00:18:04.220 --> 00:18:06.010
really shows that
we're looking at rocks

00:18:06.010 --> 00:18:12.050
that are from a primitive and
isolated source from subductive

00:18:12.050 --> 00:18:14.970
mixing down in the deep mantle.

00:18:14.970 --> 00:18:17.060
These samples were
erupted subglacially,

00:18:17.060 --> 00:18:19.700
but essentially that's
the same as [INAUDIBLE].

00:18:19.700 --> 00:18:22.952
They're under pressure, so it
stops the gas from escaping.

00:18:22.952 --> 00:18:24.910
Again, we're looking at
glassy melt inclusions,

00:18:24.910 --> 00:18:28.000
so these are some of
the inclusions in here.

00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:32.910
If you've noticed the scale on
here, that's 40 microns there.

00:18:32.910 --> 00:18:38.530
So that's about a 35 micron
width melt inclusion.

00:18:38.530 --> 00:18:41.829
That's about a fifth the
width of a human hair,

00:18:41.829 --> 00:18:43.120
and that's one of the big ones.

00:18:43.120 --> 00:18:45.960
Because that's why I've taken an
image of it, that's a good one.

00:18:45.960 --> 00:18:49.200
So the others are much
smaller than that.

00:18:49.200 --> 00:18:51.220
They're really, really
difficult measurements

00:18:51.220 --> 00:18:55.800
to make, because that
isn't a water glob

00:18:55.800 --> 00:19:00.350
inside, it isn't a liquid
bit of water, it's glass.

00:19:00.350 --> 00:19:03.879
It's only got parts per million
of water in the actual glass

00:19:03.879 --> 00:19:05.420
and we're looking
at something that's

00:19:05.420 --> 00:19:08.100
less than 40 microns across.

00:19:08.100 --> 00:19:10.190
So the measurements are
really, really difficult.

00:19:10.190 --> 00:19:13.910
Not only that, but the
samples have to be polished,

00:19:13.910 --> 00:19:16.080
they have to be prepared.

00:19:16.080 --> 00:19:18.100
So how do you do that
without using water,

00:19:18.100 --> 00:19:21.790
without using any kind of resin
that doesn't contain hydrogen,

00:19:21.790 --> 00:19:24.410
without exposing them
to the atmosphere,

00:19:24.410 --> 00:19:27.830
or touching them with your
fingers, or breathing on them?

00:19:27.830 --> 00:19:30.450
It took years for us to
perfect the methodology

00:19:30.450 --> 00:19:34.590
to be able to make
these measurements.

00:19:34.590 --> 00:19:36.580
It helps if you've
got a big machine.

00:19:36.580 --> 00:19:39.780
Which in Hawaii
we have something

00:19:39.780 --> 00:19:43.180
called the Cameca 1280
ims ion-microprobe.

00:19:43.180 --> 00:19:43.980
It's this thing.

00:19:43.980 --> 00:19:46.535
It's the size of a
big room like this.

00:19:46.535 --> 00:19:50.010
It makes a variation
of different noises.

00:19:50.010 --> 00:19:54.930
And there are three people that
permanently run this thing.

00:19:54.930 --> 00:19:58.880
It has a very high vacuum
sample chamber here which

00:19:58.880 --> 00:20:00.920
we put the samples in.

00:20:00.920 --> 00:20:03.520
They're stored in a
vacuum oven at 60 degrees

00:20:03.520 --> 00:20:05.280
C to stop hydrogen
getting anywhere

00:20:05.280 --> 00:20:06.970
near the surface of the sample.

00:20:06.970 --> 00:20:09.140
We then put them at
very high vacuum in here

00:20:09.140 --> 00:20:11.440
and we bombard them
with cesium ions.

00:20:11.440 --> 00:20:15.740
So a beam of charged
particles hits the surface

00:20:15.740 --> 00:20:21.300
and makes these little pits over
what were the melt inclusions.

00:20:21.300 --> 00:20:23.940
The pits are about one
micron depth in size,

00:20:23.940 --> 00:20:27.020
so you're not really
destroying much of the sample.

00:20:27.020 --> 00:20:30.250
And you make an aerosol
which then goes through here

00:20:30.250 --> 00:20:32.470
into the mass
spectrometer and tells you

00:20:32.470 --> 00:20:35.950
how much hydrogen you've got
versus how much deuterium

00:20:35.950 --> 00:20:38.140
you have.

00:20:38.140 --> 00:20:41.660
I should mention we also
measured oxygen isotopes just

00:20:41.660 --> 00:20:44.080
to be able to tell
whether we did have

00:20:44.080 --> 00:20:47.540
any contamination from things
like rainwater, from things

00:20:47.540 --> 00:20:50.190
like mixing as the samples
came up through the crust,

00:20:50.190 --> 00:20:54.410
did they dissolve any
kind of crystal rock

00:20:54.410 --> 00:20:56.680
into the sample which would
contaminate our hydrogen

00:20:56.680 --> 00:20:57.360
signature.

00:20:57.360 --> 00:20:59.300
If you imagine you
have some lava that

00:20:59.300 --> 00:21:01.844
dissolves a lot of sediment
that's very water rich,

00:21:01.844 --> 00:21:03.260
you don't want
that in your sample

00:21:03.260 --> 00:21:06.610
because it's going to
contaminate the results.

00:21:06.610 --> 00:21:08.560
So if I start with
this graph, actually,

00:21:08.560 --> 00:21:12.700
you can see our Icelandic
samples the points are in gray,

00:21:12.700 --> 00:21:14.780
the Baffin Island
samples are in red,

00:21:14.780 --> 00:21:18.020
and we compare them to
some previous Hawaiian data

00:21:18.020 --> 00:21:20.880
which is this green point here.

00:21:20.880 --> 00:21:24.690
Two of the Icelandic samples
showed altered oceanic crust

00:21:24.690 --> 00:21:25.480
contaminant.

00:21:25.480 --> 00:21:29.850
So immediately we
discounted these samples.

00:21:29.850 --> 00:21:33.600
So we've got delta D. Again,
Vienna Standard Mean Ocean

00:21:33.600 --> 00:21:35.630
Water is zero,
anything above that

00:21:35.630 --> 00:21:38.730
is deuterium rich
compared to ocean water,

00:21:38.730 --> 00:21:43.450
anything below is more rich in
the lighter hydrogen isotope.

00:21:43.450 --> 00:21:47.620
All our samples, apart from
these Icelandic samples

00:21:47.620 --> 00:21:51.170
which are contaminated, plotted
below Vienna Standard Mean

00:21:51.170 --> 00:21:52.460
Ocean line.

00:21:52.460 --> 00:21:55.810
That's not surprising because,
as I had mentioned, normal rock

00:21:55.810 --> 00:21:59.390
samples, they have a
negative value anyway.

00:21:59.390 --> 00:22:02.570
But this is the region of
the normal rock samples, what

00:22:02.570 --> 00:22:06.530
we call MORB, it means
Mid-Ocean Ridge Basalt. So, it's

00:22:06.530 --> 00:22:13.150
a typical sample of a
typical mantle basalt.

00:22:13.150 --> 00:22:15.110
They plot in this very
narrow region here,

00:22:15.110 --> 00:22:18.680
in this orange rectangle,
at around about minus 55

00:22:18.680 --> 00:22:20.250
to minus 65.

00:22:20.250 --> 00:22:22.150
None of our Baffin
Island samples,

00:22:22.150 --> 00:22:26.510
and this one Icelandic sample,
they don't plot in that region.

00:22:26.510 --> 00:22:29.120
So they're not
typical mantle samples

00:22:29.120 --> 00:22:32.700
according to the DH ratio.

00:22:32.700 --> 00:22:37.900
I've just plotted along
with water content here.

00:22:37.900 --> 00:22:40.250
Water content is interesting,
because we're also

00:22:40.250 --> 00:22:41.940
looking to see how
much water there

00:22:41.940 --> 00:22:45.220
is in the mantle in general.

00:22:45.220 --> 00:22:47.150
The MORB basalts
have a variation,

00:22:47.150 --> 00:22:49.650
so normal basalts have a
variation of water content.

00:22:49.650 --> 00:22:53.160
And it goes up to about
0.1 of a weight percent,

00:22:53.160 --> 00:22:55.710
so 0.1 percent,
really, of the rock

00:22:55.710 --> 00:23:01.530
will be water in the most water
rich normal mantle basalts.

00:23:01.530 --> 00:23:08.130
Our samples extend much further
in terms of water content

00:23:08.130 --> 00:23:11.600
and have much lower DH ratios.

00:23:11.600 --> 00:23:13.630
So this delta D value
here, the lowest

00:23:13.630 --> 00:23:18.490
that we measured in a Baffin
Island sample, was minus 218.

00:23:18.490 --> 00:23:23.490
That's about-- the
lowest value before that

00:23:23.490 --> 00:23:28.790
was these Hawaiian samples at,
I think this one is minus 165.

00:23:28.790 --> 00:23:31.490
So we've gone quite a bit
lower than previous samples,

00:23:31.490 --> 00:23:35.390
and these samples are even
much lower than normal samples.

00:23:35.390 --> 00:23:39.990
So we can definitely say there's
a source in the deep mantle

00:23:39.990 --> 00:23:42.170
that has a lot more of
the lighter hydrogen

00:23:42.170 --> 00:23:47.360
isotope than Vienna
Standard Mean Ocean Water.

00:23:47.360 --> 00:23:49.640
In addition, it's
got more water.

00:23:49.640 --> 00:23:50.730
So why would that be?

00:23:50.730 --> 00:23:54.357
Well, we came up with
this hypothetical source.

00:23:54.357 --> 00:23:56.190
As I mentioned at the
beginning of the talk,

00:23:56.190 --> 00:24:00.970
the sun and normal
molecular hydrogen

00:24:00.970 --> 00:24:04.260
have a lot of the
lighter hydrogen isotope.

00:24:04.260 --> 00:24:06.530
They have a very
negative delta D value.

00:24:06.530 --> 00:24:12.250
It's actually at minus 870,
so it's somewhere down here.

00:24:12.250 --> 00:24:14.620
So we use that as
our theoretical sort

00:24:14.620 --> 00:24:19.640
of end member for our
theoretical deep mantle source.

00:24:19.640 --> 00:24:23.210
And we use the water content
of around about 1 weight

00:24:23.210 --> 00:24:24.420
percent water.

00:24:24.420 --> 00:24:28.580
Because, based on the Hawaiian
lavas, and previous researchers

00:24:28.580 --> 00:24:31.280
have determined
that these samples,

00:24:31.280 --> 00:24:36.070
their source regions had around
about one weight percent water.

00:24:36.070 --> 00:24:39.050
So that source plots
somewhere over here.

00:24:39.050 --> 00:24:41.330
None of our material
in the glassy melt

00:24:41.330 --> 00:24:44.660
inclusions plots anywhere
near this theoretical,

00:24:44.660 --> 00:24:46.560
what we call the
protosolar source, so

00:24:46.560 --> 00:24:48.520
a very primitive source.

00:24:48.520 --> 00:24:52.770
We get around, at the
lowest values, a 20% value.

00:24:52.770 --> 00:24:57.000
So it's 20% this
protosolar source, and 80%

00:24:57.000 --> 00:24:59.870
this normal MORB mantle source.

00:24:59.870 --> 00:25:02.750
You would expect that
the diagram I showed you

00:25:02.750 --> 00:25:05.740
earlier on with the core
mantle boundary and the plume

00:25:05.740 --> 00:25:08.870
coming up through thousands
of kilometers of mantle,

00:25:08.870 --> 00:25:12.240
you would not expect that
that plume hadn't interacted

00:25:12.240 --> 00:25:14.240
in any way with all
of the mantle material

00:25:14.240 --> 00:25:15.680
that it was coming through.

00:25:15.680 --> 00:25:18.360
It's obviously
interacted quite a bit.

00:25:18.360 --> 00:25:21.150
But we do see a 20%
signature of something

00:25:21.150 --> 00:25:23.160
that's potentially
quite rare and that

00:25:23.160 --> 00:25:26.120
doesn't exist elsewhere on the
surface of the Earth, something

00:25:26.120 --> 00:25:29.490
that we don't have
pure samples of.

00:25:29.490 --> 00:25:32.160
-What was that 20% one for?

00:25:32.160 --> 00:25:33.100
That one?

00:25:33.100 --> 00:25:34.230
-This one?

00:25:34.230 --> 00:25:40.290
So this is 20% the theoretical
protosolar source here.

00:25:40.290 --> 00:25:42.650
-And where did it
come from again?

00:25:42.650 --> 00:25:43.150
You said it.

00:25:43.150 --> 00:25:44.620
-Oh, this is from Baffin Island.

00:25:44.620 --> 00:25:46.540
So the red samples are
from Baffin Island,

00:25:46.540 --> 00:25:48.480
and the gray are from Iceland.

00:25:48.480 --> 00:25:51.260
So it looks as though,
also, the Icelandic samples

00:25:51.260 --> 00:25:54.310
may have been more
degassed, because they

00:25:54.310 --> 00:25:56.360
contain less water.

00:25:56.360 --> 00:26:00.840
So glacial eruption probably
didn't pressurize quite as much

00:26:00.840 --> 00:26:03.500
as the subaqueous eruptions.

00:26:03.500 --> 00:26:05.750
I'm sure there's been
degassing in all of them,

00:26:05.750 --> 00:26:07.290
but it's the amount
of degassing.

00:26:07.290 --> 00:26:09.760
Here you can see they're
quite water poor compared

00:26:09.760 --> 00:26:11.999
to the Baffin Island samples.

00:26:11.999 --> 00:26:14.290
So maybe they just weren't
under quite enough pressure.

00:26:18.260 --> 00:26:21.250
In terms of oxygen
isotopes, something

00:26:21.250 --> 00:26:23.620
that we found that we
didn't expect to find

00:26:23.620 --> 00:26:26.820
was there's a correlation
between the DH ratio,

00:26:26.820 --> 00:26:30.700
the delta D values here, and
the oxygen isotope ratio.

00:26:30.700 --> 00:26:34.970
And it seems that--
this is delta 18 O,

00:26:34.970 --> 00:26:39.990
it just means
oxygen isotope of 18

00:26:39.990 --> 00:26:42.670
over an oxygen isotope
of atomic mass 16.

00:26:42.670 --> 00:26:45.380
That's the ratio there.

00:26:45.380 --> 00:26:48.800
What we see is an enrichment
in the lighter hydrogen

00:26:48.800 --> 00:26:51.730
isotopes, so a more
negative delta D value,

00:26:51.730 --> 00:26:56.120
corresponds with a lower delta
18 O value, so an enrichment

00:26:56.120 --> 00:26:59.660
in the lighter oxygen isotope.

00:26:59.660 --> 00:27:02.320
We don't really
know why this is,

00:27:02.320 --> 00:27:08.320
but protosolar things
like the solar wind

00:27:08.320 --> 00:27:11.380
are very rich in
oxygen 16 compared

00:27:11.380 --> 00:27:13.682
to sources on the Earth.

00:27:13.682 --> 00:27:15.640
So this is hinting that
there's something there

00:27:15.640 --> 00:27:17.860
that we haven't
quite understood yet.

00:27:23.020 --> 00:27:25.180
In terms of the source
of Earth's water,

00:27:25.180 --> 00:27:26.040
what does this mean?

00:27:26.040 --> 00:27:30.180
We've got a low DH ratio,
we've got lots of the lighter

00:27:30.180 --> 00:27:32.050
hydrogen isotope.

00:27:32.050 --> 00:27:35.780
What bodies in the solar system
have a similar DH ration?

00:27:35.780 --> 00:27:37.920
Well, the, sort of, front
runner at the moment

00:27:37.920 --> 00:27:40.530
is the C type asteroids.

00:27:40.530 --> 00:27:42.840
These asteroids are
thought to be the parent

00:27:42.840 --> 00:27:45.730
body for what are known as
the carbonaceous chondrite

00:27:45.730 --> 00:27:46.750
meteorites.

00:27:46.750 --> 00:27:49.300
They're quite a common
meteorite group on Earth,

00:27:49.300 --> 00:27:51.660
they're known to
contain a lot of water.

00:27:51.660 --> 00:27:54.520
Some of them are very clay
rich and they contain up

00:27:54.520 --> 00:27:56.300
to 10 weight percent water.

00:27:56.300 --> 00:27:58.910
So there's no
problem in us forming

00:27:58.910 --> 00:28:01.950
the Earth from 100%
carbonaceous chondrites

00:28:01.950 --> 00:28:03.170
and having enough water.

00:28:03.170 --> 00:28:05.950
In fact, we'd have way too much.

00:28:05.950 --> 00:28:08.660
But it's very unlikely
that the Earth

00:28:08.660 --> 00:28:11.880
formed from 100% these
carbonaceous chondrites.

00:28:11.880 --> 00:28:15.670
It's more likely that it was
a mixture of different things.

00:28:15.670 --> 00:28:19.630
In terms of the DH
ratio, that works.

00:28:19.630 --> 00:28:23.170
These C values here that
you see in the orange lines,

00:28:23.170 --> 00:28:25.870
this is DH ratio
here, you can see

00:28:25.870 --> 00:28:29.100
they plot below Vienna Standard
Mean Ocean Water, which

00:28:29.100 --> 00:28:31.960
is this orange Earth line.

00:28:31.960 --> 00:28:36.200
Minus 218, which is our
lowest Baffin Island sample,

00:28:36.200 --> 00:28:37.570
is around about here.

00:28:37.570 --> 00:28:39.970
So they do correspond
to that lower value.

00:28:39.970 --> 00:28:41.980
Some of them plot much lower.

00:28:41.980 --> 00:28:43.560
This is that protosolar
source that I

00:28:43.560 --> 00:28:47.420
was talking about at minus 870.

00:28:47.420 --> 00:28:48.790
We can see the comets up here.

00:28:48.790 --> 00:28:52.710
Really, they don't have anything
to do with these values.

00:28:52.710 --> 00:28:57.330
You cannot get all of Earth's
water from cometary origins

00:28:57.330 --> 00:29:00.640
and have the right DH ratios,
even just for the ocean water,

00:29:00.640 --> 00:29:03.320
and let alone for what we
found in the deep mantle.

00:29:03.320 --> 00:29:06.000
It doesn't work.

00:29:06.000 --> 00:29:10.330
Another facet of evidence
that's recently been discovered

00:29:10.330 --> 00:29:12.850
is from the eucrite meteorites.

00:29:12.850 --> 00:29:14.690
These are meteorites
that are thought

00:29:14.690 --> 00:29:17.260
to be from the
asteroid Vesta, which

00:29:17.260 --> 00:29:20.070
is present in the main
asteroid belt at the moment.

00:29:20.070 --> 00:29:22.050
It's still there, we
sent a mission to it,

00:29:22.050 --> 00:29:23.070
we had a look at it.

00:29:23.070 --> 00:29:25.390
And we said we've got
these meteorites on Earth,

00:29:25.390 --> 00:29:28.770
we've got these spectra from
a remote sensing orbiter,

00:29:28.770 --> 00:29:31.110
and it looks like they're
made of the same stuff.

00:29:31.110 --> 00:29:33.370
So that was a really
successful mission in saying,

00:29:33.370 --> 00:29:36.510
Yes, we definitely got
pieces of Vesta on Earth

00:29:36.510 --> 00:29:38.740
and they're known as
the eucrite meteorites.

00:29:38.740 --> 00:29:42.190
The interesting thing is
they have the same DH ratio

00:29:42.190 --> 00:29:44.320
as the carbonaceous chondrites.

00:29:44.320 --> 00:29:47.325
And so it was said
that the eucrites

00:29:47.325 --> 00:29:50.200
are formed from the
carbonaceous chondrites.

00:29:50.200 --> 00:29:53.420
Now Vesta is interesting because
it's not any normal asteroid.

00:29:53.420 --> 00:29:56.300
It's actually, we
think, a remnant

00:29:56.300 --> 00:29:59.900
planetesimal from the
beginning of the solar system.

00:29:59.900 --> 00:30:02.330
So in the early part
of the solar system

00:30:02.330 --> 00:30:04.470
we have smaller
planets that formed

00:30:04.470 --> 00:30:07.200
into larger and larger planets
by hitting into each other,

00:30:07.200 --> 00:30:08.960
colliding, destroying
each other,

00:30:08.960 --> 00:30:11.380
and eventually we end up
with the four rocky planets

00:30:11.380 --> 00:30:13.060
that we have today.

00:30:13.060 --> 00:30:15.200
There were hundreds
of planetesimals,

00:30:15.200 --> 00:30:17.080
and there is now
one that we know

00:30:17.080 --> 00:30:21.260
of that's left that didn't get
destroyed, and that's Vesta.

00:30:21.260 --> 00:30:24.647
It formed only 20 million
years after the formation

00:30:24.647 --> 00:30:26.730
of the solar system-- that
sounds like a long time

00:30:26.730 --> 00:30:29.070
to a non-geologist,
but it really isn't.

00:30:29.070 --> 00:30:31.050
It's a blink of an eye.

00:30:31.050 --> 00:30:34.080
These are some of the oldest
meteorites that we know of,

00:30:34.080 --> 00:30:38.880
and they kind of could
be the intermediate stage

00:30:38.880 --> 00:30:41.520
between these
carbonaceous chondrites

00:30:41.520 --> 00:30:45.320
and the terrestrial planets
like Mars, Earth, Mercury,

00:30:45.320 --> 00:30:47.190
and Venus.

00:30:47.190 --> 00:30:50.100
So this is a really popular
theory at the moment.

00:30:50.100 --> 00:30:53.210
The problem is it
doesn't really work

00:30:53.210 --> 00:30:58.550
because based on models
of solar system formation,

00:30:58.550 --> 00:31:01.640
the carbonaceous chondrites were
nowhere near where Earth was

00:31:01.640 --> 00:31:04.750
forming when it was forming.

00:31:04.750 --> 00:31:08.340
This is a diagram
from a 2011 paper

00:31:08.340 --> 00:31:12.040
that looked at giant
planet migration.

00:31:12.040 --> 00:31:14.630
So these are the giant planets,
the black circles here.

00:31:14.630 --> 00:31:19.220
You've got Jupiter the biggest
and the other three behind it.

00:31:19.220 --> 00:31:21.600
And you can see
that Jupiter moves

00:31:21.600 --> 00:31:25.140
in towards the inner solar
system after about four

00:31:25.140 --> 00:31:27.790
million years after the
solar system formed.

00:31:27.790 --> 00:31:30.840
Jupiter moves in, Saturn follows
a little bit, the other two

00:31:30.840 --> 00:31:32.310
kind of stay where they are.

00:31:32.310 --> 00:31:35.170
And what happens in the
inner solar system where

00:31:35.170 --> 00:31:38.600
the rocky planets are forming
is you get this huge sort

00:31:38.600 --> 00:31:41.130
of chaotic environment.

00:31:41.130 --> 00:31:42.890
Jupiter squashes
everything together

00:31:42.890 --> 00:31:45.500
and everything goes crazy.

00:31:45.500 --> 00:31:47.500
Saturn comes in and
then eventually they

00:31:47.500 --> 00:31:49.910
move back out to
their current orbits

00:31:49.910 --> 00:31:52.570
and you form the
four rocky planets.

00:31:52.570 --> 00:31:54.720
The problem with
this diagram is that

00:31:54.720 --> 00:31:58.310
the carbonaceous chondrites
are the blue dots.

00:31:58.310 --> 00:32:00.890
They formed in the
outer solar system.

00:32:00.890 --> 00:32:04.350
The red dots, which here seem
to be the material that make up

00:32:04.350 --> 00:32:05.900
the terrestrial
planets, are what's

00:32:05.900 --> 00:32:07.930
known as the
ordinary chondrites,

00:32:07.930 --> 00:32:10.140
and they are a very
common meteorite.

00:32:10.140 --> 00:32:11.660
They fall to Earth all the time.

00:32:11.660 --> 00:32:14.200
If any of you remember
the meteor that

00:32:14.200 --> 00:32:17.249
fell over Russia that
landed in the lake,

00:32:17.249 --> 00:32:18.540
that was an ordinary chondrite.

00:32:18.540 --> 00:32:20.800
And everyone got really excited
and then found it, oh, it's

00:32:20.800 --> 00:32:21.716
an ordinary chondrite.

00:32:24.650 --> 00:32:26.940
So, they're common
because they are

00:32:26.940 --> 00:32:28.880
present in the
inner solar system.

00:32:28.880 --> 00:32:31.730
The problem is they don't
have the right DH ratio,

00:32:31.730 --> 00:32:34.010
they have a very high DH ratio.

00:32:34.010 --> 00:32:36.940
They contain a lot of deuterium.

00:32:36.940 --> 00:32:39.400
You can see there are
some blue spots in there,

00:32:39.400 --> 00:32:42.400
so there are some
carbonaceous chondrites,

00:32:42.400 --> 00:32:44.460
but calculations
show that this is not

00:32:44.460 --> 00:32:47.840
anywhere near enough to produce
either the right hydrogen

00:32:47.840 --> 00:32:51.040
isotope ratios that will
be low enough for Earth,

00:32:51.040 --> 00:32:52.910
or the amount of
water that we think

00:32:52.910 --> 00:32:57.740
is present even on the surface,
even for the lowest estimates.

00:32:57.740 --> 00:32:59.138
So there's a problem here.

00:33:02.100 --> 00:33:04.890
So people started to look
elsewhere and say, OK,

00:33:04.890 --> 00:33:07.690
well what other mechanisms
can we think of.

00:33:07.690 --> 00:33:12.330
So in 2015 a group at Scripps
actually thought, well,

00:33:12.330 --> 00:33:15.850
what about if we just say
we've just got some dust,

00:33:15.850 --> 00:33:18.180
one astronomical
unit from the sun.

00:33:18.180 --> 00:33:20.070
And there's water
in the cloud, we

00:33:20.070 --> 00:33:22.240
know there's water in
the molecular cloud.

00:33:22.240 --> 00:33:25.650
How much water will
stick to the dust

00:33:25.650 --> 00:33:28.380
particles, or the
olivine grains,

00:33:28.380 --> 00:33:29.830
at certain temperatures?

00:33:29.830 --> 00:33:31.730
Because it is based
on this assumption

00:33:31.730 --> 00:33:34.900
that in a hot environment you
can't stick water to anything

00:33:34.900 --> 00:33:36.870
because it is present as gas.

00:33:36.870 --> 00:33:38.390
That's not true, it turns out.

00:33:38.390 --> 00:33:42.440
And water molecules will
stick to dust particles

00:33:42.440 --> 00:33:44.400
at up to 900 Kelvin.

00:33:44.400 --> 00:33:47.105
So that's, actually,
hotter, we think,

00:33:47.105 --> 00:33:52.080
than the temperature at one
AU when the Earth was forming.

00:33:52.080 --> 00:33:54.210
Not only that, but if
there's a lot of water

00:33:54.210 --> 00:33:58.240
present and you've got
something like an olivine grain,

00:33:58.240 --> 00:34:01.050
it will start to change
to clay material.

00:34:01.050 --> 00:34:04.010
It will start to alter in this
very water rich environment.

00:34:04.010 --> 00:34:07.140
So you get more water
coming in and coming in.

00:34:07.140 --> 00:34:10.110
So, the bottom line of
that is that the entirety

00:34:10.110 --> 00:34:14.110
of Earth's water can actually
be delivered during accretion.

00:34:14.110 --> 00:34:18.659
You don't need any addition
of water from elsewhere.

00:34:18.659 --> 00:34:21.100
Not only will it be
delivered during accretion,

00:34:21.100 --> 00:34:23.340
during the formation of
Earth, but it can actually

00:34:23.340 --> 00:34:25.320
stick around as well.

00:34:25.320 --> 00:34:27.520
You form Earth
and it's very hot.

00:34:27.520 --> 00:34:28.449
You have no crust.

00:34:28.449 --> 00:34:30.780
You've got this lava world.

00:34:30.780 --> 00:34:34.120
But that's only the surface,
most of the water is inside.

00:34:34.120 --> 00:34:38.480
So for a water molecule to
get thousands of kilometers

00:34:38.480 --> 00:34:42.780
up in the short time period that
it takes for Earth to solidify

00:34:42.780 --> 00:34:45.370
at the surface is
actually very difficult.

00:34:45.370 --> 00:34:47.130
So the argument here
is that yes, you

00:34:47.130 --> 00:34:49.369
will lose a lot of water
because the Earth's hot,

00:34:49.369 --> 00:34:51.020
but you're not going
to lose all of it

00:34:51.020 --> 00:34:52.985
because there was lots
and lots of it around.

00:34:56.510 --> 00:34:58.190
The last slide, what next.

00:34:58.190 --> 00:35:00.480
Well, I mentioned
the oxygen isotopes

00:35:00.480 --> 00:35:04.810
and when I saw the correlation
that kind of suggested

00:35:04.810 --> 00:35:09.690
that the oxygen 16 was very
rich in the samples we measured,

00:35:09.690 --> 00:35:11.190
I was kicking myself
because I only

00:35:11.190 --> 00:35:16.000
measured two isotopes of oxygen.
I didn't measure oxygen 17,

00:35:16.000 --> 00:35:18.830
and oxygen 17 is
the important one

00:35:18.830 --> 00:35:23.980
for determining what body each
type of meteorite came from.

00:35:23.980 --> 00:35:27.500
So this is a very complicated
graph, but basically anything

00:35:27.500 --> 00:35:29.620
that is from Earth
at the moment plots

00:35:29.620 --> 00:35:32.986
along this dashed line, the
terrestrial fractionation line.

00:35:32.986 --> 00:35:35.110
Anything that is not from
Earth will plot elsewhere

00:35:35.110 --> 00:35:38.180
in these ellipses, for
the chondritic meteorites,

00:35:38.180 --> 00:35:42.120
this tiny ellipse here for
the Martian meteorites.

00:35:42.120 --> 00:35:47.730
Our sample suggests that if
we did measure oxygen 17,

00:35:47.730 --> 00:35:50.300
it might not have
plotted on this line.

00:35:50.300 --> 00:35:53.790
And that would be an absolute
first for any terrestrial rock.

00:35:53.790 --> 00:35:56.835
So now I need to go back to
the big machine in Hawaii

00:35:56.835 --> 00:36:01.140
and I need to make
some more measurements.

00:36:01.140 --> 00:36:02.563
OK, I think that's it.

00:36:02.563 --> 00:36:03.982
Yep.

00:36:03.982 --> 00:36:06.820
[APPLAUSE]

00:36:09.185 --> 00:36:12.950
-OK, hold your questions.

00:36:12.950 --> 00:36:17.360
We have one more speaker
and then after his talk

00:36:17.360 --> 00:36:18.900
then we'll have
them come up and you

00:36:18.900 --> 00:36:21.510
can ask questions of
both of the speakers.

00:36:21.510 --> 00:36:25.390
So our final talk
is by Ben Harden

00:36:25.390 --> 00:36:30.060
who is assistant professor
of oceanography at the Sea

00:36:30.060 --> 00:36:31.550
Education Association.

00:36:31.550 --> 00:36:35.530
I was lucky enough to
get a colleague's cruise

00:36:35.530 --> 00:36:39.230
on one of their sailing
vessels a couple years ago.

00:36:39.230 --> 00:36:42.580
And he also works as a
researcher at Woods Hole

00:36:42.580 --> 00:36:44.810
Oceanographic institute.

00:36:44.810 --> 00:36:49.110
His work centers on ocean
currents in the North Atlantic.

00:36:49.110 --> 00:36:53.900
And this, again, just by
anecdote is of interest to me

00:36:53.900 --> 00:36:58.600
because I teach a course
on navigation and one

00:36:58.600 --> 00:37:00.230
of the things that
has fascinated

00:37:00.230 --> 00:37:05.120
me is the period when the Norse
settled first Iceland and then

00:37:05.120 --> 00:37:06.020
Greenland.

00:37:06.020 --> 00:37:10.930
And there is some evidence
that temperatures in the North

00:37:10.930 --> 00:37:14.810
Atlantic were warmer, and
there is this critical area

00:37:14.810 --> 00:37:19.230
called the Denmark Strait
between Iceland and Greenland

00:37:19.230 --> 00:37:20.400
that had to be crossed.

00:37:20.400 --> 00:37:25.190
And we know that the
colonies in Greenland

00:37:25.190 --> 00:37:27.680
emerged roughly 1000 a.d.

00:37:27.680 --> 00:37:31.330
And then got shut
down around 1350,

00:37:31.330 --> 00:37:33.830
around the time of
the Little Ice Age.

00:37:33.830 --> 00:37:36.470
So this area of
the Denmark Strait

00:37:36.470 --> 00:37:38.780
has been fascinating to
me because it's somehow

00:37:38.780 --> 00:37:42.470
the source of the world's
largest underwater waterfall,

00:37:42.470 --> 00:37:45.180
and has all these strange
currents going on,

00:37:45.180 --> 00:37:48.110
and so I have to
hear about this.

00:37:48.110 --> 00:37:51.720
So his talk is entitled The
Fate of the Gulf Stream.

00:37:51.720 --> 00:37:53.420
So, here's Ben.

00:37:53.420 --> 00:37:56.300
[APPLAUSE]

00:37:57.551 --> 00:38:00.050
-This afternoon's session should
be dubbed the Brit session,

00:38:00.050 --> 00:38:02.357
I think.

00:38:02.357 --> 00:38:03.940
Thank you to Lydia
first and foremost.

00:38:03.940 --> 00:38:05.900
That was an absolutely
fascinating talk.

00:38:05.900 --> 00:38:08.877
And some stuff that I've never
really ever thought about.

00:38:08.877 --> 00:38:09.460
This is great.

00:38:09.460 --> 00:38:12.043
I think about what happens when
the water, with the water that

00:38:12.043 --> 00:38:13.927
we actually have on
our planet right now.

00:38:13.927 --> 00:38:15.343
So what I'm going
to do today, I'm

00:38:15.343 --> 00:38:18.524
going to talk a little bit about
where the water circulates to

00:38:18.524 --> 00:38:19.440
in the North Atlantic.

00:38:19.440 --> 00:38:21.020
What are some of the
important processes,

00:38:21.020 --> 00:38:22.895
and what are some of
the things that we still

00:38:22.895 --> 00:38:25.550
don't know that we need to know
in order to understand how this

00:38:25.550 --> 00:38:28.120
might change in the future.

00:38:28.120 --> 00:38:30.372
So I like to start
with this image,

00:38:30.372 --> 00:38:31.580
just because I like old maps.

00:38:31.580 --> 00:38:34.500
This is actually from
1943, it's an army map

00:38:34.500 --> 00:38:35.450
of the North Atlantic.

00:38:35.450 --> 00:38:38.830
And it shows the
surface circulation

00:38:38.830 --> 00:38:40.920
that we find in
the North Atlantic.

00:38:40.920 --> 00:38:43.334
I like it because these
lines here are streamlined,

00:38:43.334 --> 00:38:45.750
and it basically picks out
some of the really key features

00:38:45.750 --> 00:38:47.870
of the circulation around
the North Atlantic.

00:38:47.870 --> 00:38:51.414
We have a subtropical
gyre down here

00:38:51.414 --> 00:38:53.580
in the Southern portion of
the North Atlantic, which

00:38:53.580 --> 00:38:55.700
basically takes water
and circulates it

00:38:55.700 --> 00:38:57.200
all the way around.

00:38:57.200 --> 00:39:00.669
And then if we go further north
we have a subpolar gyre up

00:39:00.669 --> 00:39:02.585
in the Irminger Sea, and
that just takes water

00:39:02.585 --> 00:39:04.043
and actually sends
it the other way

00:39:04.043 --> 00:39:09.420
around over the southern
coast of Greenland up there.

00:39:09.420 --> 00:39:11.227
Right over here on
the Western boundary

00:39:11.227 --> 00:39:13.060
is a current you are
probably familiar with.

00:39:13.060 --> 00:39:14.960
That's the Gulf Stream.

00:39:14.960 --> 00:39:18.400
This is a jet of water
that starts off down here

00:39:18.400 --> 00:39:22.460
in the Caribbean region and goes
up the East Coast of the United

00:39:22.460 --> 00:39:23.270
States.

00:39:23.270 --> 00:39:26.070
If this thing was
a fire hose, it

00:39:26.070 --> 00:39:30.860
would be able to fill 10
sports stadia every second.

00:39:30.860 --> 00:39:32.660
So it's pumping a
huge amount of water.

00:39:32.660 --> 00:39:35.140
And the important thing for
climate is that water's warm.

00:39:35.140 --> 00:39:37.720
So as it comes up, it's
actually moving a lot of heat

00:39:37.720 --> 00:39:38.880
away from the equator.

00:39:38.880 --> 00:39:41.250
The equator gets an excess
of heat from the sun.

00:39:41.250 --> 00:39:44.010
The poles get not enough heat.

00:39:44.010 --> 00:39:46.620
So the Gulf Stream is really
instrumental in taking

00:39:46.620 --> 00:39:49.200
some of that heat and pumping
it northwards in the North

00:39:49.200 --> 00:39:49.760
Atlantic.

00:39:49.760 --> 00:39:53.474
And the Gulf Stream
sets off on its journey

00:39:53.474 --> 00:39:54.890
and it actually
ends up coming out

00:39:54.890 --> 00:39:56.930
between these two gyres here.

00:39:56.930 --> 00:39:59.030
Some of it gets deflected
around both ways,

00:39:59.030 --> 00:40:01.170
but you actually
get about 30% of it

00:40:01.170 --> 00:40:03.580
ends up exiting the whole
system and heading up

00:40:03.580 --> 00:40:08.080
into the Nordic seas north
of Great Britain there.

00:40:08.080 --> 00:40:13.289
I want to pause
briefly and point

00:40:13.289 --> 00:40:15.580
out something about physical
oceanographers, of which I

00:40:15.580 --> 00:40:16.500
am a member.

00:40:20.070 --> 00:40:22.198
And that is we love to
draw arrows on maps.

00:40:24.689 --> 00:40:26.230
This is a simulation
where I actually

00:40:26.230 --> 00:40:28.940
take some Earth
data from satellites

00:40:28.940 --> 00:40:30.815
and plot it up in a real
time image of what's

00:40:30.815 --> 00:40:32.856
happening with the currents
in the North Atlantic

00:40:32.856 --> 00:40:33.770
at the moment.

00:40:33.770 --> 00:40:35.410
And so, as I was
drawing on my map

00:40:35.410 --> 00:40:38.440
we had a nice, strong arrow
that was going out here

00:40:38.440 --> 00:40:40.303
across towards Northern Europe.

00:40:40.303 --> 00:40:42.260
But in reality
what's happening is

00:40:42.260 --> 00:40:44.010
we have a meandering
system that's

00:40:44.010 --> 00:40:46.200
chucking up little eddies,
and is being kind of

00:40:46.200 --> 00:40:48.810
chaotic in its progress.

00:40:48.810 --> 00:40:51.860
And if you take it further North
there's a lot of meandering,

00:40:51.860 --> 00:40:54.190
there's a lot of
chaotic movement

00:40:54.190 --> 00:40:56.860
that's going on in this region.

00:40:56.860 --> 00:40:59.067
We do have a drift
of warm water that

00:40:59.067 --> 00:41:00.775
comes up from the gulf
stream and ends up

00:41:00.775 --> 00:41:02.010
up here in the Nordic seas.

00:41:02.010 --> 00:41:03.718
And the question we're
going to ask today

00:41:03.718 --> 00:41:06.190
is what happens to that water
once it crosses that boundary

00:41:06.190 --> 00:41:08.810
up into the Arctic Ocean.

00:41:08.810 --> 00:41:10.570
So, this is the region
that we're going

00:41:10.570 --> 00:41:12.026
to be talking about today.

00:41:12.026 --> 00:41:13.900
The region that John
was talking about that's

00:41:13.900 --> 00:41:16.230
between Greenland and Iceland
here, the Denmark Strait,

00:41:16.230 --> 00:41:17.380
this is actually
the area that I'm

00:41:17.380 --> 00:41:19.296
going to focus primarily
on today because it's

00:41:19.296 --> 00:41:21.780
a really vital region for
the circulation of the North

00:41:21.780 --> 00:41:23.790
Atlantic.

00:41:23.790 --> 00:41:28.040
What we have is this remaining
30% of the Gulf Stream

00:41:28.040 --> 00:41:33.030
comes up into the Nordic seas
as a warm surface current.

00:41:33.030 --> 00:41:34.836
And it flows up,
a majority of it,

00:41:34.836 --> 00:41:36.085
to the north of Scotland here.

00:41:36.085 --> 00:41:38.450
A small sliver of it comes
in around the North coast

00:41:38.450 --> 00:41:40.200
of Iceland.

00:41:40.200 --> 00:41:42.260
And the great thing about
physical oceanography

00:41:42.260 --> 00:41:46.590
is that we can follow
these currents by tagging

00:41:46.590 --> 00:41:48.250
their unique fingerprints.

00:41:48.250 --> 00:41:50.720
So each current
has a temperature

00:41:50.720 --> 00:41:53.240
and it has a
salinity, a saltiness.

00:41:53.240 --> 00:41:54.970
And by looking at
those two properties,

00:41:54.970 --> 00:41:56.770
we can actually create a
fingerprint for that current.

00:41:56.770 --> 00:41:58.360
And then as we
follow it along, we

00:41:58.360 --> 00:42:01.360
can actually work
out where it goes.

00:42:01.360 --> 00:42:03.010
The important thing
about this current

00:42:03.010 --> 00:42:05.260
is that it's very, very
warm as it comes in.

00:42:05.260 --> 00:42:07.325
That's the reason why we
have tropical conditions

00:42:07.325 --> 00:42:10.040
at the south coast of
Cornwall in the UK.

00:42:10.040 --> 00:42:13.680
It's the reason why the most
northerly botanic gardens

00:42:13.680 --> 00:42:15.470
in the world is in
Tromso in Norway.

00:42:15.470 --> 00:42:17.810
This current is bringing
a lot of heat northwards.

00:42:17.810 --> 00:42:20.400
It's vital to the
climates of these regions.

00:42:20.400 --> 00:42:23.360
If we didn't have this warm
flow of water coming northwards,

00:42:23.360 --> 00:42:26.410
we'd be in a very similar
climatic situation to Labrador

00:42:26.410 --> 00:42:28.430
or Alaska in our climate.

00:42:28.430 --> 00:42:32.050
So, you know, these are really,
really important inputs of heat

00:42:32.050 --> 00:42:34.600
into this region.

00:42:34.600 --> 00:42:37.830
So we have this warm water
flowing into this region.

00:42:37.830 --> 00:42:39.890
This region here is
called the Nordic seas.

00:42:39.890 --> 00:42:42.220
It's basically the gateway
into the Arctic Ocean,

00:42:42.220 --> 00:42:44.580
which is up here.

00:42:44.580 --> 00:42:47.770
The Arctic Ocean, though,
is an enclosed basin.

00:42:47.770 --> 00:42:49.824
There's no real way
out once you go in.

00:42:49.824 --> 00:42:51.490
There's a couple of
little gaps, there's

00:42:51.490 --> 00:42:53.700
one over here,
the Bering Strait,

00:42:53.700 --> 00:42:56.060
and there's some areas through
the archipelago in Canada

00:42:56.060 --> 00:42:59.120
that water can eke through,
but not in great quantity.

00:42:59.120 --> 00:43:01.260
So, the situation
our warm water's got

00:43:01.260 --> 00:43:03.470
is once it comes
in, it can't keep

00:43:03.470 --> 00:43:05.546
coming in unless some
water is flowing out.

00:43:05.546 --> 00:43:07.670
Otherwise, we're just going
to keep piling, piling,

00:43:07.670 --> 00:43:09.480
piling all this water
up in the North,

00:43:09.480 --> 00:43:11.580
and it won't be able to do that.

00:43:11.580 --> 00:43:14.500
One of the primary ways that we
exchange that warm water that

00:43:14.500 --> 00:43:18.820
goes north is with dense water
that's coming back south.

00:43:18.820 --> 00:43:21.810
And this what is coming back
south not at the surface,

00:43:21.810 --> 00:43:23.860
but deep in the ocean.

00:43:23.860 --> 00:43:26.380
It's actually passing
across, conveniently for us

00:43:26.380 --> 00:43:28.020
who you want to
measure it, there's

00:43:28.020 --> 00:43:31.040
a ridge, an oceanic ridge
that runs between Greenland,

00:43:31.040 --> 00:43:32.880
Iceland, the
Faroes, and Scotland

00:43:32.880 --> 00:43:34.240
that has some small gaps in it.

00:43:34.240 --> 00:43:37.310
This ridge is about six to
1,000 meters deep in the ocean.

00:43:37.310 --> 00:43:38.950
It has these small gaps.

00:43:38.950 --> 00:43:41.550
One is the Denmark Strait,
there's the Faroe bank channel

00:43:41.550 --> 00:43:43.925
over here, and there's a small
one to the east of Iceland

00:43:43.925 --> 00:43:44.589
as well.

00:43:44.589 --> 00:43:45.964
The Denmark Strait
is the one I'm

00:43:45.964 --> 00:43:48.338
going to focus on today because
it's the primary channel.

00:43:48.338 --> 00:43:49.830
It is the largest
of the overflows.

00:43:49.830 --> 00:43:51.746
It's ultimately the
densest of the overthrows.

00:43:51.746 --> 00:43:53.730
It has the largest
contributor to the, kind of,

00:43:53.730 --> 00:43:56.334
return flow of water.

00:43:56.334 --> 00:43:57.750
And the basic
question that people

00:43:57.750 --> 00:43:59.250
have been asking
for quite some time

00:43:59.250 --> 00:44:03.090
is how do we take this warm
water that is flowing in

00:44:03.090 --> 00:44:04.970
and turn it into that
dense water that's

00:44:04.970 --> 00:44:07.600
going to flow back out again?

00:44:07.600 --> 00:44:10.550
Basically, as a side
schematic, it looks like this.

00:44:10.550 --> 00:44:12.410
We have warm water flowing in.

00:44:12.410 --> 00:44:15.020
We need to somehow
convert this warm water

00:44:15.020 --> 00:44:18.300
into dense water that can then
go over this ridge and cascade

00:44:18.300 --> 00:44:19.390
down to the deep ocean.

00:44:19.390 --> 00:44:22.850
This is, as John was
saying, one of the largest

00:44:22.850 --> 00:44:24.460
underwater waterfalls
in the world.

00:44:24.460 --> 00:44:27.130
It's cascading from
about 600 meters depth

00:44:27.130 --> 00:44:29.250
all the way down to
2 and 1/2 kilometers

00:44:29.250 --> 00:44:31.770
or further as it
goes back southwards.

00:44:31.770 --> 00:44:34.590
Hugely dynamic system.

00:44:34.590 --> 00:44:37.110
But it all starts
in how we produce

00:44:37.110 --> 00:44:39.260
the dense water, the
deep, dense water

00:44:39.260 --> 00:44:42.250
north of the Denmark Strait.

00:44:42.250 --> 00:44:44.620
So oceanographers,
physical oceanographers,

00:44:44.620 --> 00:44:47.100
have mulled this over
for many decades.

00:44:47.100 --> 00:44:49.260
Back in the 80s,
everyone was basically

00:44:49.260 --> 00:44:51.520
centered on the idea of OK,
you just send warm water

00:44:51.520 --> 00:44:52.650
into that basin.

00:44:52.650 --> 00:44:54.440
You hit it with
intense cold winds.

00:44:54.440 --> 00:44:56.920
Maybe you form some sea
ice which rejects some salt

00:44:56.920 --> 00:44:57.610
into the water.

00:44:57.610 --> 00:44:59.735
And eventually that water
just becomes dense enough

00:44:59.735 --> 00:45:03.820
in the central basins that it
just sinks and flows back out.

00:45:03.820 --> 00:45:08.020
This was challenged in the
1990s by a researcher called

00:45:08.020 --> 00:45:10.780
[INAUDIBLE] who proposed
that instead of looking

00:45:10.780 --> 00:45:13.350
in the middle of the ocean
here, we should actually

00:45:13.350 --> 00:45:17.150
follow the Gulf Stream on its
path and see where it goes.

00:45:17.150 --> 00:45:19.760
And she proposed that
actually what's happening

00:45:19.760 --> 00:45:22.070
is this Gulf Stream
water, as it comes in,

00:45:22.070 --> 00:45:24.340
is just flowing progressively
around the outside

00:45:24.340 --> 00:45:25.150
of the Nordic sea.

00:45:25.150 --> 00:45:27.570
It's being hit by winds.

00:45:27.570 --> 00:45:29.640
Sea ice is being
formed around it.

00:45:29.640 --> 00:45:32.670
And basically you just get
colder and saltier all the way

00:45:32.670 --> 00:45:34.610
around until
eventually it can sink

00:45:34.610 --> 00:45:36.876
along the edge of
the continent here

00:45:36.876 --> 00:45:38.000
and flow straight back out.

00:45:38.000 --> 00:45:39.458
So we've got like
a pipeline system

00:45:39.458 --> 00:45:44.142
now, rather than a
more diffuse system.

00:45:44.142 --> 00:45:47.560
If we zoom in to the Denmark
Strait in particular,

00:45:47.560 --> 00:45:51.490
this current we call the
East Greenland Current

00:45:51.490 --> 00:45:53.490
because it flows on the
east coast of Greenland.

00:45:53.490 --> 00:45:55.620
It comes in here,
passes over here,

00:45:55.620 --> 00:45:57.330
this is our sill at
600 meters, and then

00:45:57.330 --> 00:46:00.509
it's about to cascade down
into the really deep ocean.

00:46:00.509 --> 00:46:02.300
And what you can do is
you can go out there

00:46:02.300 --> 00:46:03.966
and you can take a
ship across this line

00:46:03.966 --> 00:46:06.750
and lower some instrumentation
and look at the fingerprints

00:46:06.750 --> 00:46:07.650
of those currents.

00:46:07.650 --> 00:46:12.840
And you can really see those
significant fingerprints.

00:46:12.840 --> 00:46:14.960
This is a cross-section
of the ocean.

00:46:14.960 --> 00:46:17.390
Over here is the
Greenland coast.

00:46:17.390 --> 00:46:18.180
This is the shelf.

00:46:18.180 --> 00:46:20.638
And this is dropping off into
the middle the Denmark Strait

00:46:20.638 --> 00:46:21.870
here.

00:46:21.870 --> 00:46:23.980
Everything below
this white line here

00:46:23.980 --> 00:46:25.927
is destined to
join the overflow.

00:46:25.927 --> 00:46:28.010
And what you can see is
we have temperature on top

00:46:28.010 --> 00:46:30.040
here, and salinity
on the bottom here,

00:46:30.040 --> 00:46:32.690
is that below that white
line we have this nice blob

00:46:32.690 --> 00:46:34.875
of warm, salty water.

00:46:34.875 --> 00:46:37.125
It's got a lot denser since
it was in the Gulf Stream,

00:46:37.125 --> 00:46:40.260
but really that fingerprint
is still on that current.

00:46:40.260 --> 00:46:43.580
We know that it came from
the Gulf Stream water.

00:46:43.580 --> 00:46:45.360
And more importantly,
it's flowing out

00:46:45.360 --> 00:46:48.870
of the page towards
us, towards the Strait.

00:46:48.870 --> 00:46:50.960
Of also note, up
here on the shelf

00:46:50.960 --> 00:46:54.330
we have a lot of very, very
cold, very, very fresh water.

00:46:54.330 --> 00:46:56.285
And that's the outflow
from the Arctic Ocean.

00:46:56.285 --> 00:46:57.910
So the Arctic dumps
a lot of freshwater

00:46:57.910 --> 00:46:59.897
into the ocean, which
then flows out as well.

00:46:59.897 --> 00:47:02.230
So actually, it's a combined
current. the East Greenland

00:47:02.230 --> 00:47:02.880
Current.

00:47:02.880 --> 00:47:06.610
We have a deep, dense component
that came from the Gulf Stream

00:47:06.610 --> 00:47:10.580
originally, and then we have
this fresh surface outflow

00:47:10.580 --> 00:47:13.407
which is joining
it at the surface.

00:47:13.407 --> 00:47:15.490
So everything was great,
everything was hunky dory

00:47:15.490 --> 00:47:16.272
back in the 1990s.

00:47:16.272 --> 00:47:17.980
We knew where this
water was coming from.

00:47:17.980 --> 00:47:20.000
We knew how the Denmark
Strait got it's water.

00:47:20.000 --> 00:47:22.720
We knew where the key regions
were to focus on in order

00:47:22.720 --> 00:47:25.420
to understand how
the water might

00:47:25.420 --> 00:47:28.010
be changed under future
climate change [INAUDIBLE].

00:47:28.010 --> 00:47:28.940
Bingo.

00:47:28.940 --> 00:47:32.396
2000s came, some
pesky Icelanders

00:47:32.396 --> 00:47:34.520
discovered a brand new
current that no one had ever

00:47:34.520 --> 00:47:38.650
seen before flowing on the
North coast of Iceland.

00:47:38.650 --> 00:47:41.190
This is not an
uncommon occurrence

00:47:41.190 --> 00:47:43.500
to discover currents
in this region.

00:47:43.500 --> 00:47:45.410
They're very, very
small in scale

00:47:45.410 --> 00:47:48.190
compared to the Gulf Stream
because of rotational effects

00:47:48.190 --> 00:47:50.544
as you get higher up
towards the poles.

00:47:50.544 --> 00:47:51.960
But this is a brand
new discovery,

00:47:51.960 --> 00:47:54.376
and this was also bringing
dense water towards the Strait,

00:47:54.376 --> 00:47:57.160
but it wasn't coming from the
same direction as the East

00:47:57.160 --> 00:47:57.410
Greenland Current.

00:47:57.410 --> 00:47:59.660
It was coming from around
the corner, around the coast

00:47:59.660 --> 00:48:00.690
of Iceland over here.

00:48:00.690 --> 00:48:02.315
They called it the
North Icelandic Jet,

00:48:02.315 --> 00:48:04.110
and if you expand
that cross-section

00:48:04.110 --> 00:48:07.030
that I showed originally,
all the way out over here,

00:48:07.030 --> 00:48:09.820
this is Iceland now over
here, you can see roughly

00:48:09.820 --> 00:48:11.450
where this dashed
line is here we

00:48:11.450 --> 00:48:15.866
got a demarcation from this
warm, salty overflow water that

00:48:15.866 --> 00:48:17.740
was going to be in the
East Greenland Current

00:48:17.740 --> 00:48:23.140
and you suddenly jump to a much
fresher, much colder product.

00:48:23.140 --> 00:48:25.560
A fingerprint that was
distinctly different

00:48:25.560 --> 00:48:27.260
from the Gulf
Stream, and we needed

00:48:27.260 --> 00:48:28.890
to know where that
was coming from.

00:48:28.890 --> 00:48:32.560
Importantly, again, it's coming
out of the page towards us.

00:48:32.560 --> 00:48:35.806
It's flowing this
way towards the cell.

00:48:35.806 --> 00:48:38.840
Of note, also, up here we've
got some very warm, salty water.

00:48:38.840 --> 00:48:41.800
That's that little eking
stream of warm water

00:48:41.800 --> 00:48:45.147
we had flowing in round
the top of Iceland.

00:48:45.147 --> 00:48:46.980
So we've got that warm
water coming directly

00:48:46.980 --> 00:48:50.640
in from the Gulf Stream
as well in that region.

00:48:50.640 --> 00:48:53.760
So that's basically the
situation as we understood it.

00:48:53.760 --> 00:48:55.835
We had a very well
known source of water,

00:48:55.835 --> 00:48:58.390
and all of a sudden we had
this mysterious current that

00:48:58.390 --> 00:49:00.265
was coming from a new
direction and we didn't

00:49:00.265 --> 00:49:02.312
know where it's coming from.

00:49:02.312 --> 00:49:04.270
And so that's significant,
looking at those two

00:49:04.270 --> 00:49:06.770
dense pathways, because if we
don't know where that water is

00:49:06.770 --> 00:49:09.104
coming from, we don't know
what formation regions are

00:49:09.104 --> 00:49:10.020
going to be important.

00:49:10.020 --> 00:49:11.394
If we change the
wind conditions,

00:49:11.394 --> 00:49:13.980
if we change freshwater
inputs, if we change sea ice

00:49:13.980 --> 00:49:16.100
distributions, how
would that affect

00:49:16.100 --> 00:49:18.265
the water that's being
produced that then feeds in?

00:49:18.265 --> 00:49:20.140
How would that then
affect how much water can

00:49:20.140 --> 00:49:21.520
flow north in the Gulf Stream?

00:49:24.150 --> 00:49:27.900
The reason we've only recently
discovered these pathways

00:49:27.900 --> 00:49:29.570
and been asking
these questions is

00:49:29.570 --> 00:49:32.360
that this is a pretty
perilous place to visit.

00:49:32.360 --> 00:49:34.540
As a context to the
video I'm about the show,

00:49:34.540 --> 00:49:37.090
I did my undergraduate
in physics

00:49:37.090 --> 00:49:38.510
and my master's in physics.

00:49:38.510 --> 00:49:41.850
I dabbled in particle physics
and astrophysics for a while

00:49:41.850 --> 00:49:44.530
before deciding that I
wanted to do something

00:49:44.530 --> 00:49:46.700
more environmental in my focus.

00:49:46.700 --> 00:49:49.110
And so I signed up
for a PhD Program

00:49:49.110 --> 00:49:52.560
at the University of East Anglia
where my supervisor promptly

00:49:52.560 --> 00:49:53.700
sent me to sea.

00:49:53.700 --> 00:49:57.060
And said go to sea,
there's a research vessel

00:49:57.060 --> 00:50:00.260
that's going to be out
in the Denmark Strait,

00:50:00.260 --> 00:50:03.980
you're going to study
the wind conditions

00:50:03.980 --> 00:50:06.306
around the coast of
Greenland and your thesis

00:50:06.306 --> 00:50:08.180
is all going to be about
extreme wind events.

00:50:08.180 --> 00:50:08.910
I was like, this is fine.

00:50:08.910 --> 00:50:09.570
I can do this.

00:50:09.570 --> 00:50:13.590
He said, go stand out on
the back of the vessel

00:50:13.590 --> 00:50:18.741
and launch meter wide helium
balloons into the storm.

00:50:18.741 --> 00:50:20.366
I've got this on mute
because you don't

00:50:20.366 --> 00:50:23.490
want to hear the commentary.

00:50:23.490 --> 00:50:24.810
-How big is that wave?

00:50:24.810 --> 00:50:27.740
-Oh, it's, it was at least
as high as the bridge,

00:50:27.740 --> 00:50:28.809
if not more.

00:50:28.809 --> 00:50:30.600
This is the research
vessel in [INAUDIBLE].

00:50:30.600 --> 00:50:33.760
And so my job during
this first installment

00:50:33.760 --> 00:50:36.592
of my oceanography career was
to go out and try and stand

00:50:36.592 --> 00:50:38.800
on the back of that ship to
launch a weather balloon.

00:50:38.800 --> 00:50:40.200
-Were you tied in?

00:50:40.200 --> 00:50:41.554
-Just about, yeah.

00:50:44.664 --> 00:50:46.080
It was an exhilarating
experience,

00:50:46.080 --> 00:50:48.540
but the interesting--
within the context

00:50:48.540 --> 00:50:52.330
of this interdisciplinary
notion that John

00:50:52.330 --> 00:50:54.790
was talking about in
the introduction, one

00:50:54.790 --> 00:50:57.740
of the great things
about this region

00:50:57.740 --> 00:51:00.460
is there's so much influence
of the atmosphere on the ocean.

00:51:00.460 --> 00:51:01.980
This is how I got
interested in oceanography

00:51:01.980 --> 00:51:04.188
in the first place was seeing
these winds and saying,

00:51:04.188 --> 00:51:06.390
wow, you know, this is
a dynamic environment.

00:51:06.390 --> 00:51:09.930
I wonder what these winds
are doing to the ocean.

00:51:09.930 --> 00:51:12.169
So it's very hard to
go to this region.

00:51:12.169 --> 00:51:14.210
You go out there in these
ships, you try and take

00:51:14.210 --> 00:51:15.876
these measurements,
and we only actually

00:51:15.876 --> 00:51:18.670
have four snapshots
across this current system

00:51:18.670 --> 00:51:23.711
in eight years of asking.

00:51:23.711 --> 00:51:25.960
So you've really only got
this little tiny look at it.

00:51:25.960 --> 00:51:29.040
And the problem with it
is that every time you

00:51:29.040 --> 00:51:31.920
go out with the ship the
current system looks different.

00:51:31.920 --> 00:51:33.790
You want to measure how much
water is coming from each place

00:51:33.790 --> 00:51:35.831
if you want to know how
much each is contributing

00:51:35.831 --> 00:51:36.530
to the overflow.

00:51:36.530 --> 00:51:40.562
2004 the East Greenland
Current, 85% of the overflow.

00:51:40.562 --> 00:51:42.020
Great, cool, we've
got this sorted.

00:51:42.020 --> 00:51:44.490
We don't need to worry about
the North Icelandic Jet.

00:51:44.490 --> 00:51:46.630
2012, oh heck, it's
gone the other way.

00:51:46.630 --> 00:51:50.650
60% of it's in the
North Icelandic Jet.

00:51:50.650 --> 00:51:52.040
So we've got a problem here.

00:51:52.040 --> 00:51:55.616
We don't know whether this
is-- is this a seasonal thing?

00:51:55.616 --> 00:51:57.490
Because we actually only
go out in the summer

00:51:57.490 --> 00:51:58.640
to measure these things.

00:51:58.640 --> 00:52:00.530
What's even happening
in the winter time?

00:52:00.530 --> 00:52:03.580
Is this, if we went out a week
later would it be different?

00:52:03.580 --> 00:52:05.420
If we went out a year later?

00:52:05.420 --> 00:52:07.356
You know, is this
a decadal trend?

00:52:07.356 --> 00:52:09.480
Or is this something that's
happening very quickly?

00:52:09.480 --> 00:52:12.200
And we really don't have a
way of doing that if we just

00:52:12.200 --> 00:52:13.810
keep going out with
ships one by one

00:52:13.810 --> 00:52:16.330
to try and measure
these systems.

00:52:16.330 --> 00:52:19.160
So the way that we
solved the problem

00:52:19.160 --> 00:52:22.810
is kind of a technological
solution, which

00:52:22.810 --> 00:52:25.360
is to go out with a
series of moorings

00:52:25.360 --> 00:52:27.520
across the whole current system.

00:52:27.520 --> 00:52:29.270
So a mooring, an
oceanographic mooring,

00:52:29.270 --> 00:52:30.970
is basically a big
anchor that sits

00:52:30.970 --> 00:52:33.880
on the sea floor with
a wire that comes up

00:52:33.880 --> 00:52:35.400
to a very buoyant float.

00:52:35.400 --> 00:52:37.930
We keep our floats about
100 meters below the surface

00:52:37.930 --> 00:52:39.930
because there's a lot of
icebergs in the region,

00:52:39.930 --> 00:52:41.471
there's a lot of
fishing vessels that

00:52:41.471 --> 00:52:42.870
will come along and smash them.

00:52:42.870 --> 00:52:46.930
We lose a lot of moorings
in this region because

00:52:46.930 --> 00:52:48.904
of those kind of activities.

00:52:48.904 --> 00:52:50.320
So we have to be
a little careful,

00:52:50.320 --> 00:52:52.292
and the old
oceanography adage is

00:52:52.292 --> 00:52:53.875
you don't put something
into the water

00:52:53.875 --> 00:52:55.880
that you're expecting
to get back.

00:52:55.880 --> 00:52:59.116
You have to be a little bit
realistic about this process.

00:52:59.116 --> 00:53:00.740
And I thought I'd
just say a little bit

00:53:00.740 --> 00:53:01.870
about how we deploy
them, because I

00:53:01.870 --> 00:53:03.161
think it's kind of fascinating.

00:53:03.161 --> 00:53:04.860
You have to take the
ship back out there

00:53:04.860 --> 00:53:06.039
to put these things in.

00:53:06.039 --> 00:53:08.580
And the way that you put them
in is you kind of go backwards.

00:53:08.580 --> 00:53:09.913
This is, again, the [INAUDIBLE].

00:53:09.913 --> 00:53:12.090
This is a much nicer day
in the Denmark Strait.

00:53:12.090 --> 00:53:14.214
We got very lucky on
this particular cruise.

00:53:14.214 --> 00:53:16.130
And the idea is you're
on the back of the ship

00:53:16.130 --> 00:53:18.030
and you put it in backwards.

00:53:18.030 --> 00:53:20.639
You put the float in
first, the top float.

00:53:20.639 --> 00:53:22.055
Put that in the
water, release it,

00:53:22.055 --> 00:53:24.000
and you've got the wire now
attached to the bottom of it,

00:53:24.000 --> 00:53:24.570
right.

00:53:24.570 --> 00:53:26.430
And you now steam
away from that and you

00:53:26.430 --> 00:53:28.290
start laying out
your wire, you start

00:53:28.290 --> 00:53:30.850
adding the instrumentation
one by one,

00:53:30.850 --> 00:53:32.270
and you just keep
spooling it out.

00:53:32.270 --> 00:53:36.530
And eventually you end up with
the anchor that goes over last.

00:53:36.530 --> 00:53:39.215
So you lower the anchor in,
it's just a big chunk of steel.

00:53:39.215 --> 00:53:41.590
Then when you get to exactly
the right point in the ocean

00:53:41.590 --> 00:53:46.140
where you want to drop it
you trigger the release,

00:53:46.140 --> 00:53:50.050
the anchor drops,
buoys go down, and then

00:53:50.050 --> 00:53:51.960
that top float comes
water skiing towards you

00:53:51.960 --> 00:53:55.600
as it's being dragged
down underneath the water.

00:53:58.240 --> 00:54:00.400
And so then you
leave them there.

00:54:00.400 --> 00:54:03.290
We actually left 12 of
them across the whole thing

00:54:03.290 --> 00:54:04.827
between Iceland and Greenland.

00:54:04.827 --> 00:54:06.910
You leave them there for
a year, you go back home,

00:54:06.910 --> 00:54:08.530
you go back to
your regular life,

00:54:08.530 --> 00:54:10.280
and you try not to think
about it because there's

00:54:10.280 --> 00:54:11.404
no point worrying about it.

00:54:11.404 --> 00:54:13.130
You might go out next
year and discover

00:54:13.130 --> 00:54:15.240
that every single one of
them has been destroyed,

00:54:15.240 --> 00:54:16.560
or taken away somewhere else.

00:54:16.560 --> 00:54:22.030
You have to do the best you can
to put that out of your mind.

00:54:22.030 --> 00:54:24.320
And then you do go
out a year later

00:54:24.320 --> 00:54:26.860
to find out whether these
things are still there,

00:54:26.860 --> 00:54:29.500
and one of the things about
going to pick these moorings up

00:54:29.500 --> 00:54:32.860
is that they're
below the surface

00:54:32.860 --> 00:54:34.870
and you can't see
them from the boat.

00:54:34.870 --> 00:54:36.909
So you have to find
them electronically,

00:54:36.909 --> 00:54:39.450
and you have to, using a fish
finder, or something like that,

00:54:39.450 --> 00:54:41.440
go back to the place
where you left them.

00:54:41.440 --> 00:54:45.180
And because radio waves travel
really badly through the water,

00:54:45.180 --> 00:54:47.000
you can't just send
a radio signal out

00:54:47.000 --> 00:54:48.230
to say, hey, release it.

00:54:48.230 --> 00:54:51.180
You actually have to use sound,
sound waves, in the water.

00:54:51.180 --> 00:54:53.910
And so what you do is
you go back out again

00:54:53.910 --> 00:54:57.200
on a different ship, also a nice
day off the coast of Greenland.

00:54:57.200 --> 00:55:01.250
And this is a little
speaker, basically,

00:55:01.250 --> 00:55:03.850
that sends out sound
waves into the water

00:55:03.850 --> 00:55:05.980
over the side of the ship.

00:55:05.980 --> 00:55:08.860
And we send a coded
series of pings which

00:55:08.860 --> 00:55:10.240
the anchor is listening for.

00:55:10.240 --> 00:55:12.861
And if we send the right
combination at the right code,

00:55:12.861 --> 00:55:14.360
basically, to the
anchor, it's going

00:55:14.360 --> 00:55:16.080
to release its
grip on the anchor

00:55:16.080 --> 00:55:18.930
and then the whole thing's going
to float up to the surface.

00:55:18.930 --> 00:55:20.390
But you don't know where
it's going to come up.

00:55:20.390 --> 00:55:21.624
And everyone looks
at the ocean, and you

00:55:21.624 --> 00:55:23.707
don't know whether it's
actually going to show up.

00:55:23.707 --> 00:55:26.185
And all of a sudden it pings
up onto the surface there.

00:55:26.185 --> 00:55:28.930
Now it's floating around and
you have to go pick it up

00:55:28.930 --> 00:55:30.930
with your ship.

00:55:30.930 --> 00:55:33.570
Those are the good
days when that happens.

00:55:33.570 --> 00:55:36.530
The bad days can be when you
send a ping out it says, OK,

00:55:36.530 --> 00:55:39.700
I've released, and then nothing
shows up at the surface.

00:55:39.700 --> 00:55:42.520
And then you have to go
out with-- you actually

00:55:42.520 --> 00:55:44.770
put a long grappling
hook out behind the ship

00:55:44.770 --> 00:55:47.260
and just go around, and
round, and round in the ocean

00:55:47.260 --> 00:55:48.843
hoping you're going
to grab something.

00:55:48.843 --> 00:55:51.333
And then you drive away, hoping
it's going to kind of drag

00:55:51.333 --> 00:55:55.350
the whole thing with it.

00:55:55.350 --> 00:55:57.630
So we actually got really,
really lucky on this trip.

00:55:57.630 --> 00:55:58.790
All 12 of them came back.

00:55:58.790 --> 00:56:00.873
This is not something that
happens very regularly.

00:56:00.873 --> 00:56:03.810
So we've actually been able to
now look at the whole Strait

00:56:03.810 --> 00:56:06.680
wide circulation in
some detail, and not

00:56:06.680 --> 00:56:11.030
just through four snapshots
of what the current's doing.

00:56:11.030 --> 00:56:15.675
We now have 1008 snapshots
over the course of a year.

00:56:15.675 --> 00:56:18.300
And so we can do things that we
haven't been able to do before,

00:56:18.300 --> 00:56:20.930
like produce an average
hydrographic section,

00:56:20.930 --> 00:56:24.377
an average temperature and
salinity across the strait.

00:56:24.377 --> 00:56:25.960
And this looks largely
similar to some

00:56:25.960 --> 00:56:27.230
of the stuff we've seen before.

00:56:27.230 --> 00:56:28.771
Again, Greenland on
the left, Iceland

00:56:28.771 --> 00:56:31.520
on the right, this white line
is that line that's important.

00:56:31.520 --> 00:56:33.978
Everything below that is going
to join the overflow, that's

00:56:33.978 --> 00:56:37.392
the dense water that's
going to go head back South.

00:56:37.392 --> 00:56:40.162
Up on the surface,
on the left here, we

00:56:40.162 --> 00:56:42.040
have that cold
fresh surface water

00:56:42.040 --> 00:56:43.310
from the Arctic pouring out.

00:56:43.310 --> 00:56:44.950
That's all the melt water.

00:56:44.950 --> 00:56:47.670
Over right here that's
the warmer, saltier waters

00:56:47.670 --> 00:56:50.600
coming in from the Atlantic
Ocean surface, those two

00:56:50.600 --> 00:56:51.960
surface currents.

00:56:51.960 --> 00:56:56.270
And then deeper down, below
that density interface,

00:56:56.270 --> 00:57:00.310
we have warm, salty water from
the East Greenland Current,

00:57:00.310 --> 00:57:02.597
and then, again, colder,
fresher water over

00:57:02.597 --> 00:57:04.680
on the Iceland side from
the North Icelandic jets.

00:57:04.680 --> 00:57:07.284
We have, again, seen
these fingerprints now

00:57:07.284 --> 00:57:08.700
over the course
of the whole year.

00:57:08.700 --> 00:57:10.940
So we can start to say, hey,
we think the North Icelandic

00:57:10.940 --> 00:57:12.970
Jet's actually going to be an
important thing all year round,

00:57:12.970 --> 00:57:15.110
it's not necessarily
just a summertime thing.

00:57:15.110 --> 00:57:17.030
We even went further
and were able to compare

00:57:17.030 --> 00:57:22.490
those fingerprints of those
two currents to historic data

00:57:22.490 --> 00:57:24.730
from upstream of
the Denmark Strait.

00:57:24.730 --> 00:57:27.340
So this is our mooring array
here across the strait.

00:57:27.340 --> 00:57:30.145
This is one mooring over here
in the East Greenland Current,

00:57:30.145 --> 00:57:32.020
and one over here in
the North Icelandic Jet.

00:57:32.020 --> 00:57:34.603
And we can actually compare the
fingerprints between these two

00:57:34.603 --> 00:57:36.270
regions, and they
match up really well.

00:57:36.270 --> 00:57:37.490
So we've actually been
able to show not just

00:57:37.490 --> 00:57:38.850
that we have two
different kind of waters,

00:57:38.850 --> 00:57:40.900
but they actually come
from two different places

00:57:40.900 --> 00:57:43.590
along the coast.

00:57:43.590 --> 00:57:45.830
I wanted to show you
earlier about the fact

00:57:45.830 --> 00:57:48.720
that we love drawing
arrows on maps

00:57:48.720 --> 00:57:51.540
to point out where the
currents are going from and to.

00:57:51.540 --> 00:57:58.120
The reality, again, is that
we can't quite be so specific.

00:57:58.120 --> 00:58:01.690
This is a video of the
current velocities,

00:58:01.690 --> 00:58:04.440
the speed of the currents
coming through the red.

00:58:04.440 --> 00:58:06.560
And Greenland on the left,
Iceland on the right.

00:58:06.560 --> 00:58:09.530
Red colors mean the
current's coming towards us,

00:58:09.530 --> 00:58:15.590
and blue colors mean the
current's heading away from us.

00:58:15.590 --> 00:58:18.180
And so at times it
looks kind of stable.

00:58:18.180 --> 00:58:20.490
But then after a while
it starts to cascade.

00:58:20.490 --> 00:58:22.620
And you get blobs of
blue, and blobs of red,

00:58:22.620 --> 00:58:24.570
and they shift from
one side to the other

00:58:24.570 --> 00:58:27.940
when things start coming in
and going out of the region.

00:58:27.940 --> 00:58:29.500
And this is just to
exemplify that we

00:58:29.500 --> 00:58:32.080
love drawing these arrows that
point currents in singular

00:58:32.080 --> 00:58:35.410
directions, but in reality
we have a very dynamic system

00:58:35.410 --> 00:58:37.910
that's eddying and distorting
throughout the year.

00:58:37.910 --> 00:58:42.620
So, how can we use this
kind of information

00:58:42.620 --> 00:58:45.120
to actually say how much water
is coming from each direction

00:58:45.120 --> 00:58:47.160
if it's so dynamic?

00:58:47.160 --> 00:58:49.150
And we use those
fingerprints, in general,

00:58:49.150 --> 00:58:50.590
to be able to do this.

00:58:50.590 --> 00:58:54.190
Say, this is one snapshot
of the current at one time.

00:58:54.190 --> 00:58:56.352
Here's a current
coming out of the page,

00:58:56.352 --> 00:58:58.310
here's another current
over here, a little tiny

00:58:58.310 --> 00:58:59.422
one, that's up here.

00:58:59.422 --> 00:59:01.130
And here is our
temperature and salinity.

00:59:01.130 --> 00:59:03.950
And then, again, you can
see those same fingerprints,

00:59:03.950 --> 00:59:07.290
warm, salty over
here, and then colder

00:59:07.290 --> 00:59:09.530
and fresher over on that side.

00:59:09.530 --> 00:59:13.190
And we can basically draw a line
at every time, every snapshot

00:59:13.190 --> 00:59:16.880
that we have that divides the
currents between currents that

00:59:16.880 --> 00:59:19.945
are carrying the East Greenland
Current water, these two here,

00:59:19.945 --> 00:59:22.320
and currents that are carrying
North Icelandic Jet water,

00:59:22.320 --> 00:59:23.750
this little current up here.

00:59:23.750 --> 00:59:27.170
So we can actually use the
data about the fingerprints

00:59:27.170 --> 00:59:29.770
to divide these currents
up into what kind of water

00:59:29.770 --> 00:59:31.900
they're bringing.

00:59:31.900 --> 00:59:34.760
And so the results of that
are shown in this figure.

00:59:34.760 --> 00:59:37.330
It's a time series that
shows the percentage

00:59:37.330 --> 00:59:39.950
from the Greenland side, the
percentage of East Greenland

00:59:39.950 --> 00:59:41.730
Current that's in our array.

00:59:41.730 --> 00:59:43.306
And so over here
would be entirely

00:59:43.306 --> 00:59:45.680
East Greenland Current, over
here would be entirely North

00:59:45.680 --> 00:59:48.220
Icelandic Jet.

00:59:48.220 --> 00:59:51.990
So the light line is what's
happening every single eight

00:59:51.990 --> 00:59:58.200
hours, the dark line is a
smoothed average over 30 days.

00:59:58.200 --> 01:00:00.370
And so what we can see
is, actually, this current

01:00:00.370 --> 01:00:01.730
is extremely dynamic.

01:00:01.730 --> 01:00:04.300
It's jumping from 100%
East Greenland Current

01:00:04.300 --> 01:00:06.524
to 100% North
Icelandic Jet at times.

01:00:06.524 --> 01:00:07.940
It's going back
and forth, someone

01:00:07.940 --> 01:00:09.410
is turning the
faucet on, and off,

01:00:09.410 --> 01:00:12.770
and on, and off, on different
sides of this Strait

01:00:12.770 --> 01:00:14.551
to bring water through.

01:00:14.551 --> 01:00:16.800
You can also see that there's
some kind of seasonality

01:00:16.800 --> 01:00:20.100
as well, maybe in the wintertime
the East Greenland Current

01:00:20.100 --> 01:00:21.170
brings more water.

01:00:21.170 --> 01:00:24.340
Maybe the North Icelandic
Jet's a bigger player

01:00:24.340 --> 01:00:26.940
in the summertime when we've
seen it before in our, kind of,

01:00:26.940 --> 01:00:29.230
snapshots.

01:00:29.230 --> 01:00:30.960
So there's much to
learn from this.

01:00:30.960 --> 01:00:32.960
The simplest thing we can
do is take an average.

01:00:32.960 --> 01:00:34.770
It's the first time we're
able to do this and actually

01:00:34.770 --> 01:00:37.400
robustly say how much water's
coming from each direction,

01:00:37.400 --> 01:00:39.840
and about 70% of it's coming
from the East Greenland

01:00:39.840 --> 01:00:45.320
Current and 30% is coming
from the North Icelandic Jet.

01:00:45.320 --> 01:00:47.680
So we now have a
pretty good image

01:00:47.680 --> 01:00:52.594
of the importance of these
two different branches.

01:00:52.594 --> 01:00:54.260
And we now know that
the North Icelandic

01:00:54.260 --> 01:00:56.370
Jet is something that's
there all year round,

01:00:56.370 --> 01:00:58.720
and it brings a significant
quantity of water.

01:00:58.720 --> 01:01:01.200
The question now is
where does it come from?

01:01:01.200 --> 01:01:02.890
And that's still
an open question.

01:01:02.890 --> 01:01:03.870
We don't really know.

01:01:03.870 --> 01:01:07.220
One hypothesis is that that
warm water that actually comes

01:01:07.220 --> 01:01:10.170
in north of Iceland, it
kind of spreads out here

01:01:10.170 --> 01:01:13.310
into the Iceland Sea, and
it's subject to very, very

01:01:13.310 --> 01:01:17.620
cold intense winter conditions,
and it sinks directly here

01:01:17.620 --> 01:01:20.584
and flows directly back
towards the Strait.

01:01:20.584 --> 01:01:22.750
The reason we think that
is because, actually, we've

01:01:22.750 --> 01:01:24.150
followed the North
Icelandic Jet upstream

01:01:24.150 --> 01:01:25.430
and followed that fingerprint.

01:01:25.430 --> 01:01:28.460
It eventually just
peters out around here.

01:01:28.460 --> 01:01:30.010
Kind of comes from nowhere.

01:01:30.010 --> 01:01:32.550
But it was also, kind of,
comes from a very large body

01:01:32.550 --> 01:01:33.192
of dense water.

01:01:33.192 --> 01:01:34.900
So we think there's
a kind of smoking gun

01:01:34.900 --> 01:01:36.750
there about where
that water is formed.

01:01:36.750 --> 01:01:38.360
But we don't know.

01:01:38.360 --> 01:01:40.840
The next big project is heading
out into the Iceland Sea

01:01:40.840 --> 01:01:43.440
to work out whether we can find
exactly where that water is

01:01:43.440 --> 01:01:45.904
coming from.

01:01:45.904 --> 01:01:47.320
Taking a step out
again, you know,

01:01:47.320 --> 01:01:49.940
now we kind of have this
slightly more sophisticated

01:01:49.940 --> 01:01:53.120
picture of where the overflow
water is coming from.

01:01:53.120 --> 01:01:54.940
This region here
in the Iceland Sea

01:01:54.940 --> 01:01:57.570
could be important, this region
here where making dense water

01:01:57.570 --> 01:01:58.840
could be important.

01:01:58.840 --> 01:02:00.416
There are also
other possibilities,

01:02:00.416 --> 01:02:02.290
things that we may not
have thought about yet

01:02:02.290 --> 01:02:04.748
because we haven't been able
to go out there and measure it

01:02:04.748 --> 01:02:06.677
often enough.

01:02:06.677 --> 01:02:09.010
But this all kind of brings
us back to the central point

01:02:09.010 --> 01:02:11.732
is that if we can't make this
dense water somewhere, then

01:02:11.732 --> 01:02:13.440
we can't bring the
warm water northwards.

01:02:13.440 --> 01:02:16.765
And that's going to change the
climate of the Northern Europe

01:02:16.765 --> 01:02:17.265
regions.

01:02:19.860 --> 01:02:22.160
So, some key questions
going forward.

01:02:22.160 --> 01:02:24.490
You know, where is this
North Icelandic Jet formed?

01:02:24.490 --> 01:02:30.340
How is it formed and
how often is it formed?

01:02:30.340 --> 01:02:32.480
Do the two branches
compensate for each other?

01:02:32.480 --> 01:02:34.990
If, under some
climate scenario, we

01:02:34.990 --> 01:02:37.710
have an increase in wind
in a particular area,

01:02:37.710 --> 01:02:40.770
sea ice retreated
back somewhere,

01:02:40.770 --> 01:02:43.180
would one of these
currents be able to pick up

01:02:43.180 --> 01:02:46.305
the slack from the other one
if the other one was weakening?

01:02:46.305 --> 01:02:48.450
Would the other one be
able to intensify in order

01:02:48.450 --> 01:02:50.260
to pick up the slack?

01:02:50.260 --> 01:02:51.600
It's an open question.

01:02:51.600 --> 01:02:53.340
And how sensitive
is the whole system?

01:02:53.340 --> 01:02:56.311
We know in the past that
this whole thermohaline,

01:02:56.311 --> 01:02:58.060
this whole circulation,
the North Atlantic

01:02:58.060 --> 01:03:00.917
shut down various glacial
periods in the past.

01:03:00.917 --> 01:03:03.250
Is that something that could
happen under climate change

01:03:03.250 --> 01:03:05.916
scenarios, or is the
system robust enough

01:03:05.916 --> 01:03:07.290
under the kind of
changes that it

01:03:07.290 --> 01:03:09.610
will see to actually be
able to sustain itself

01:03:09.610 --> 01:03:13.150
and be able to keep bringing
this warm water northwards?

01:03:13.150 --> 01:03:14.990
I turn to this picture.

01:03:14.990 --> 01:03:17.790
We've been asking the question
of how this warm water flows

01:03:17.790 --> 01:03:20.310
North, and it's because we can
exchange with this deep water

01:03:20.310 --> 01:03:21.050
that flows South.

01:03:21.050 --> 01:03:24.070
And as it cascades down
to 2000, 3000 meters,

01:03:24.070 --> 01:03:26.060
it makes it's way
southwards and it hugs

01:03:26.060 --> 01:03:26.935
the east coast of the states.

01:03:26.935 --> 01:03:28.810
It actually ends up
directly underneath where

01:03:28.810 --> 01:03:30.400
it started in the Gulf Stream.

01:03:30.400 --> 01:03:32.170
So it kind of goes
nowhere eventually,

01:03:32.170 --> 01:03:33.810
it just gets deeper.

01:03:33.810 --> 01:03:38.196
And ends up heading all the way
down southwards past Brazil.

01:03:38.196 --> 01:03:39.820
And, you know, there's
a kind of couple

01:03:39.820 --> 01:03:43.140
of things I wanted to say about
this larger scale circulation.

01:03:43.140 --> 01:03:45.600
Was that there's been
some effort for a while

01:03:45.600 --> 01:03:49.460
to actually monitor that
large scale circulation down

01:03:49.460 --> 01:03:50.590
off the coast of Florida.

01:03:50.590 --> 01:03:53.500
A large mooring
array out here called

01:03:53.500 --> 01:03:56.940
the rapid array which is trying
to measure the warm water

01:03:56.940 --> 01:03:58.950
outflow and the
cold water inflow

01:03:58.950 --> 01:04:01.910
and try to make some estimates
of how robust the system is,

01:04:01.910 --> 01:04:05.880
how the heat exchange is
actually changing over time.

01:04:05.880 --> 01:04:09.640
And lest we forget this whole
thing is tied into a larger

01:04:09.640 --> 01:04:11.460
system that goes planet wide.

01:04:11.460 --> 01:04:13.560
We've been talking
about this warm water

01:04:13.560 --> 01:04:17.712
outflow, the cold water
exchange coming back South.

01:04:17.712 --> 01:04:19.812
But this whole thing is
tied into a complex series

01:04:19.812 --> 01:04:21.520
of currents that extend
around the globe.

01:04:21.520 --> 01:04:24.770
How could one, how could
changes in one of these branches

01:04:24.770 --> 01:04:28.325
impact onwards throughout
that entire system.

01:04:28.325 --> 01:04:30.950
So that's the, kind of, thought
I wanted to leave you on today.

01:04:30.950 --> 01:04:32.616
Thank you very much
for having me speak.

01:04:32.616 --> 01:04:33.540
It's been a pleasure.

01:04:33.540 --> 01:04:36.324
[APPLAUSE]

01:04:40.290 --> 01:04:45.130
-So Lydia, can you come
join Andrew at the table?

01:04:45.130 --> 01:04:48.230
And entertain questions?

01:04:48.230 --> 01:04:52.390
So there's a microphone in
the back, so other questions

01:04:52.390 --> 01:04:53.440
from the audience.

01:04:53.440 --> 01:04:54.604
Go ahead.

01:04:54.604 --> 01:04:56.020
-Can we start with
your questions?

01:04:56.020 --> 01:04:57.150
-Start with my question?

01:04:57.150 --> 01:05:00.610
Well, OK, well the first
question is for Lydia

01:05:00.610 --> 01:05:04.380
and it's just going to reveal
that I'm a physics nerd,

01:05:04.380 --> 01:05:06.450
but at least I'm
in good company.

01:05:06.450 --> 01:05:12.002
What is the ion beam that you
use to extract the isotopes?

01:05:12.002 --> 01:05:13.960
I mean, I'm just trying
to picture what you do.

01:05:13.960 --> 01:05:18.150
You scan it for
these little pockets,

01:05:18.150 --> 01:05:19.770
and then you find
the pocket, and then

01:05:19.770 --> 01:05:23.931
you have to be able to direct
this tiny, really small beam?

01:05:23.931 --> 01:05:24.430
-Yeah.

01:05:24.430 --> 01:05:26.330
It's cesium ions that we use.

01:05:26.330 --> 01:05:27.140
-OK.

01:05:27.140 --> 01:05:30.880
-So, first of all what we
do is we put the samples

01:05:30.880 --> 01:05:33.180
in the electron microscope
to actually take pictures

01:05:33.180 --> 01:05:35.280
of those glass pockets.

01:05:35.280 --> 01:05:38.440
So that's kind of
our reconnaissance.

01:05:38.440 --> 01:05:41.180
And when we find
them, the problem

01:05:41.180 --> 01:05:43.250
is the ion microprobe,
actually, is

01:05:43.250 --> 01:05:45.520
a really sophisticated machine.

01:05:45.520 --> 01:05:48.010
But the imaging system is
actually a really old, like,

01:05:48.010 --> 01:05:51.240
1980 CCD TV camera.

01:05:51.240 --> 01:05:54.550
So all you can see on
the surface is cracks.

01:05:54.550 --> 01:05:56.970
And the sample is
coated in carbon,

01:05:56.970 --> 01:05:59.220
so you can't see any of
that detail on that image.

01:05:59.220 --> 01:06:00.770
You can't see at all.

01:06:00.770 --> 01:06:02.020
All you can see is the cracks.

01:06:02.020 --> 01:06:05.490
So you have to, kind of, have a
map of the cracks in your mind.

01:06:05.490 --> 01:06:07.840
And then go, OK, let's move
a little bit leftwards,

01:06:07.840 --> 01:06:08.690
a little bit.

01:06:08.690 --> 01:06:10.672
And then you make the pit.

01:06:10.672 --> 01:06:12.630
Then you put it back in
the electron microscope

01:06:12.630 --> 01:06:16.140
and you say, damn, I missed it.

01:06:16.140 --> 01:06:18.230
So it takes a long
time to actually,

01:06:18.230 --> 01:06:22.791
sort of, work around how
to navigate in the system.

01:06:22.791 --> 01:06:24.290
And then make sure
that you've hit--

01:06:24.290 --> 01:06:27.650
the worst is when you half
hit, because if you half

01:06:27.650 --> 01:06:32.220
hit you've destroyed the sample,
but you haven't got any data.

01:06:32.220 --> 01:06:34.620
-That reminds me of this
t-shirt my son got me

01:06:34.620 --> 01:06:38.430
which is stand back,
I'm doing science.

01:06:38.430 --> 01:06:41.874
OK, a question here
from the audience?

01:06:41.874 --> 01:06:44.720
-Yeah, this is a
question for Lydia.

01:06:44.720 --> 01:06:45.860
Is this on?

01:06:45.860 --> 01:06:46.460
Hello?

01:06:46.460 --> 01:06:47.250
-Yeah.

01:06:47.250 --> 01:06:50.600
-OK, and this is a
very naive question.

01:06:50.600 --> 01:06:52.796
But my curiosity, or my
need to have it answered,

01:06:52.796 --> 01:06:54.170
is greater than
my embarrassment.

01:06:54.170 --> 01:06:55.920
So I'm going to ask it
anyway, because I've

01:06:55.920 --> 01:06:57.170
wondered about it for a while.

01:06:57.170 --> 01:07:00.760
Now, you gave us a criterion
by which we could possibly

01:07:00.760 --> 01:07:04.970
determine whether water on
Earth was produced coevally

01:07:04.970 --> 01:07:07.430
with the Earth, or
whether it came later

01:07:07.430 --> 01:07:09.180
from outside the Earth
extraterrestrially.

01:07:11.860 --> 01:07:13.520
And that leads to
my question which

01:07:13.520 --> 01:07:15.380
is, what does it
mean to say, when we

01:07:15.380 --> 01:07:17.460
say we're running out of water?

01:07:17.460 --> 01:07:20.360
I mean, does it, it just
means to say that water

01:07:20.360 --> 01:07:21.850
is becoming less accessible?

01:07:21.850 --> 01:07:23.970
Like they say the
aquifers are empty.

01:07:23.970 --> 01:07:25.660
But the water's going
somewhere, right?

01:07:25.660 --> 01:07:26.300
-Yes.

01:07:26.300 --> 01:07:29.090
-It's not being
desynthesized, or whatever.

01:07:29.090 --> 01:07:34.111
It's not being analyzed into
oxygen and hydrogen, right?

01:07:34.111 --> 01:07:34.610
-No.

01:07:34.610 --> 01:07:37.680
Apart from the small
amount that we do actually

01:07:37.680 --> 01:07:40.370
lose all the time from
the upper atmosphere--

01:07:40.370 --> 01:07:42.090
-It goes out into outer space.

01:07:42.090 --> 01:07:43.370
-That is lost to space.

01:07:43.370 --> 01:07:47.680
But in terms of our reservoirs
and aquifers on the surface,

01:07:47.680 --> 01:07:50.620
it's us that's
using the water up.

01:07:50.620 --> 01:07:54.429
And it is becoming less
accessible, it's just that--

01:07:54.429 --> 01:07:56.220
-But it's just going
somewhere else, right?

01:07:56.220 --> 01:07:56.690
-Yeah.

01:07:56.690 --> 01:07:58.190
-It's not going to
the rocks, right?

01:07:58.190 --> 01:08:00.960
I mean, we don't have conditions
in which it could, or.

01:08:00.960 --> 01:08:03.670
-It can if you talk
about at plate margins,

01:08:03.670 --> 01:08:05.570
you have lots of ocean
water and sediment.

01:08:05.570 --> 01:08:09.030
But that, that's been
happening all the time.

01:08:09.030 --> 01:08:12.200
I think the deep water aquifers,
it's because we're using it up

01:08:12.200 --> 01:08:14.530
and we're pumping it
out into the oceans,

01:08:14.530 --> 01:08:15.840
into the river system.

01:08:15.840 --> 01:08:17.896
So it's being removed
from the land,

01:08:17.896 --> 01:08:19.479
and it's being pumped
into the oceans.

01:08:19.479 --> 01:08:20.840
And then going elsewhere.

01:08:20.840 --> 01:08:22.240
Because some of
these systems-- I

01:08:22.240 --> 01:08:24.479
think there was a paper
a few years ago that

01:08:24.479 --> 01:08:28.109
talked about a water aquifer
underneath North America that's

01:08:28.109 --> 01:08:30.653
actually 1.2 billion years old.

01:08:30.653 --> 01:08:32.819
-That's the Ogallala, that's
what I'm talking about.

01:08:32.819 --> 01:08:35.521
They say it's emptying
out, it's almost empty now.

01:08:35.521 --> 01:08:36.020
-Really?

01:08:36.020 --> 01:08:38.870
-Because the California farms
are using so much water.

01:08:38.870 --> 01:08:40.569
-The Oklahoma farms.

01:08:40.569 --> 01:08:42.569
It's under Oklahoma.

01:08:42.569 --> 01:08:44.330
The Ogallala is.

01:08:44.330 --> 01:08:46.109
-So it doesn't take that much--

01:08:46.109 --> 01:08:47.950
-But it's agriculture
that's using it.

01:08:47.950 --> 01:08:50.630
--human activity to destroy
things that have been around

01:08:50.630 --> 01:08:53.330
for billions of years.

01:08:53.330 --> 01:08:54.566
-OK, thank you.

01:08:54.566 --> 01:08:55.899
-There was a question back here.

01:09:00.255 --> 01:09:02.260
-Hi, this is for the gentleman.

01:09:02.260 --> 01:09:04.050
I'm wondering if you
have any more picture

01:09:04.050 --> 01:09:06.569
of those underwater waterfalls.

01:09:06.569 --> 01:09:09.420
Like, I'm kind of curious.

01:09:09.420 --> 01:09:13.290
-Yeah, it's a little hard.

01:09:13.290 --> 01:09:16.520
You've got water
falling through water,

01:09:16.520 --> 01:09:20.032
so it's not actually something
you can take a picture of.

01:09:20.032 --> 01:09:22.490
We know that they exist because
you can go down and measure

01:09:22.490 --> 01:09:23.670
the speed of the water.

01:09:23.670 --> 01:09:26.035
And you know that the water
above it's largely stagnant,

01:09:26.035 --> 01:09:27.410
and then this
layer on the bottom

01:09:27.410 --> 01:09:30.090
is sliding down
to the deep water.

01:09:30.090 --> 01:09:32.649
But we're talking about
ocean currents, which

01:09:32.649 --> 01:09:35.540
aren't necessarily falling
at the rate of water

01:09:35.540 --> 01:09:36.590
from a waterfall.

01:09:36.590 --> 01:09:39.589
Typically these currents,
at their strongest velocity,

01:09:39.589 --> 01:09:43.979
is maybe moving, upstream
of the Strait, maybe 10,

01:09:43.979 --> 01:09:47.186
20 centimeters a second.

01:09:47.186 --> 01:09:48.560
Actually, in the
overflow itself,

01:09:48.560 --> 01:09:50.160
you might get up to
like a meter a second,

01:09:50.160 --> 01:09:51.069
or something like that.

01:09:51.069 --> 01:09:52.818
The Gulf Stream's a
particularly fast one,

01:09:52.818 --> 01:09:54.660
that can go at least
a meter a second.

01:09:54.660 --> 01:09:59.840
But, yeah, it's a little
hard to visualize explicitly.

01:09:59.840 --> 01:10:02.290
You kind of have to-- with
all of physical oceanography,

01:10:02.290 --> 01:10:04.373
I think part of the beauty
of it, a friend of mine

01:10:04.373 --> 01:10:07.954
said this, was that you
can't see below the waves,

01:10:07.954 --> 01:10:09.370
and so a lot of
what we have to do

01:10:09.370 --> 01:10:12.360
is throw our imaginations
down into the deep

01:10:12.360 --> 01:10:14.297
to see these things.

01:10:14.297 --> 01:10:16.505
-Is it the same thing that's
happening in the Bermuda

01:10:16.505 --> 01:10:18.140
Triangle, or is
that something else?

01:10:18.140 --> 01:10:21.570
-I don't know specifically
about the Bermuda Triangle's

01:10:21.570 --> 01:10:23.447
specific oceanography,
so I don't know.

01:10:23.447 --> 01:10:25.030
-That's where the
airplanes disappear.

01:10:25.030 --> 01:10:27.045
-It's where the airplanes
disappear, I do know that.

01:10:27.045 --> 01:10:28.730
But I think that's
outside the purview

01:10:28.730 --> 01:10:30.136
of physical oceanography.

01:10:33.130 --> 01:10:35.730
-Question, we have two here.

01:10:35.730 --> 01:10:38.360
I guess we'll work
our way forward.

01:10:38.360 --> 01:10:39.770
-Also a question for Ben.

01:10:39.770 --> 01:10:41.420
You were talking a
little bit about how

01:10:41.420 --> 01:10:42.980
what you're looking
at specifically

01:10:42.980 --> 01:10:45.431
is related to global
ocean circulation.

01:10:45.431 --> 01:10:47.180
And I was wondering,
thinking about, like,

01:10:47.180 --> 01:10:49.470
North Atlantic deep water
formation, and stuff like that.

01:10:49.470 --> 01:10:51.070
Looking forwards
with climate change,

01:10:51.070 --> 01:10:54.540
what do you know or think
about possible changes

01:10:54.540 --> 01:10:57.360
in that circulation and whether
the specific currents you're

01:10:57.360 --> 01:10:59.310
looking at could
have some effect,

01:10:59.310 --> 01:11:00.690
and how do they change too?

01:11:00.690 --> 01:11:02.610
-Yeah, absolutely.

01:11:02.610 --> 01:11:06.360
We know from the geological
record that in the past

01:11:06.360 --> 01:11:08.620
that circulation has
largely shut off,

01:11:08.620 --> 01:11:10.000
or it has become
shallower, or it

01:11:10.000 --> 01:11:11.560
has moved to a different
part the North Atlantic,

01:11:11.560 --> 01:11:13.720
all of which would
affect how much heat we

01:11:13.720 --> 01:11:15.220
can get northwards.

01:11:15.220 --> 01:11:17.850
One of the major concerns
in the climate change

01:11:17.850 --> 01:11:20.700
is melting of the
Greenland ice sheet.

01:11:20.700 --> 01:11:22.190
You melt more fresh
water, you dump

01:11:22.190 --> 01:11:24.130
that out into the ocean,
and all of a sudden

01:11:24.130 --> 01:11:28.480
you've got this fresh, really
light cap on the water that

01:11:28.480 --> 01:11:30.590
is really hard for
the winds to cool

01:11:30.590 --> 01:11:32.080
down enough to make it sink.

01:11:32.080 --> 01:11:34.840
So you're basically shutting
off, and making little cap

01:11:34.840 --> 01:11:39.210
on the surface which shuts off
this dense water formation.

01:11:39.210 --> 01:11:42.820
It's not entirely clear
if that is happening

01:11:42.820 --> 01:11:44.599
or will be important.

01:11:44.599 --> 01:11:46.390
As I was showing, a
lot of that fresh water

01:11:46.390 --> 01:11:49.630
is flushed out along
the shelf of Greenland.

01:11:49.630 --> 01:11:51.150
It's going to be
important to know

01:11:51.150 --> 01:11:53.910
if we can get that fresh
water off the shelf

01:11:53.910 --> 01:11:56.740
and into the open ocean regions
where this dense water is

01:11:56.740 --> 01:11:57.850
being formed.

01:11:57.850 --> 01:12:00.410
That's going to be important.

01:12:00.410 --> 01:12:02.955
Another thing is if we
have retreating sea ice.

01:12:02.955 --> 01:12:05.580
The edge of the sea ice is often
where a lot of the dense water

01:12:05.580 --> 01:12:07.830
is made because you have
these winds coming off

01:12:07.830 --> 01:12:11.180
the edge of it, they're very
cold and they're very dry.

01:12:11.180 --> 01:12:13.850
So you can take both moisture
and heat out, both of which

01:12:13.850 --> 01:12:15.490
make the water denser.

01:12:15.490 --> 01:12:18.550
And so the sea
ice edge positions

01:12:18.550 --> 01:12:20.400
are kind of important
parameter in knowing

01:12:20.400 --> 01:12:22.608
where the dense water is
going to form, specifically.

01:12:22.608 --> 01:12:25.060
So if that sea ice keeps
retreating or changing

01:12:25.060 --> 01:12:29.420
its positions, it may change
where we form the deep water.

01:12:29.420 --> 01:12:31.720
Just as, you know, what
we've seen currently

01:12:31.720 --> 01:12:34.680
there's been no evidence so
far, no categoric evidence

01:12:34.680 --> 01:12:38.676
that we've seen a
slowdown in that system.

01:12:38.676 --> 01:12:41.130
But we also know that it
has happened in the past

01:12:41.130 --> 01:12:42.280
and it could happen again.

01:12:42.280 --> 01:12:44.576
And we have lots of hypothesis
for how it might change.

01:12:50.490 --> 01:12:52.840
-My question is for Lydia.

01:12:52.840 --> 01:12:56.040
One of the really
mind blowing things

01:12:56.040 --> 01:13:00.470
that has come to my attention
as we've started here

01:13:00.470 --> 01:13:04.420
at the Institute to think about
our year focused on oceans

01:13:04.420 --> 01:13:06.520
is the question
that you addressed,

01:13:06.520 --> 01:13:09.080
where do oceans come from?

01:13:09.080 --> 01:13:13.040
Because at first I thought
I've never thought about that,

01:13:13.040 --> 01:13:14.542
that's really interesting.

01:13:14.542 --> 01:13:16.250
And then the next
question becomes, well,

01:13:16.250 --> 01:13:19.790
how the heck are you ever
going to answer that question?

01:13:19.790 --> 01:13:24.350
And so you've really had this
really amazing presentation

01:13:24.350 --> 01:13:29.870
of where your research and
the analysis of your materials

01:13:29.870 --> 01:13:31.790
is leading you.

01:13:31.790 --> 01:13:36.050
But I really appreciated you
showing that complex machine,

01:13:36.050 --> 01:13:39.190
because it really puts
those of us who are not

01:13:39.190 --> 01:13:44.090
in the lab in your
kind of world about,

01:13:44.090 --> 01:13:46.870
you can't just dream this up,
and it's not just a theory.

01:13:46.870 --> 01:13:49.890
It's a tested something,
but how do we test it?

01:13:49.890 --> 01:13:52.470
And I'm wondering, if that
machine has been so important

01:13:52.470 --> 01:13:54.670
to, kind of, advancing
some of the understanding

01:13:54.670 --> 01:13:57.490
that you're making,
can you help us

01:13:57.490 --> 01:14:00.490
think through what we should
be looking for as that machine

01:14:00.490 --> 01:14:01.210
evolves?

01:14:01.210 --> 01:14:04.740
Or as other machines, and,
I guess, a lot of us in town

01:14:04.740 --> 01:14:07.300
here are reflecting
on the breakthrough

01:14:07.300 --> 01:14:11.210
with LIGO and the way that
that machine, and the machine

01:14:11.210 --> 01:14:13.600
structure, helped
to really catalyze

01:14:13.600 --> 01:14:15.880
a new way of
understanding space.

01:14:15.880 --> 01:14:16.380
-Yeah.

01:14:16.380 --> 01:14:18.400
-Thank you.

01:14:18.400 --> 01:14:22.660
-It definitely has really, sort
of, revolutionized the analysis

01:14:22.660 --> 01:14:27.860
of-- that particular machine--
the analysis of chemistry

01:14:27.860 --> 01:14:31.150
in meteorites in
particular, I think.

01:14:31.150 --> 01:14:35.470
Because 10 years ago we
didn't know that the moon

01:14:35.470 --> 01:14:37.550
had any water at all.

01:14:37.550 --> 01:14:39.220
And it was only
through the analysis

01:14:39.220 --> 01:14:43.990
of Apollo samples on a
similar machine like this one

01:14:43.990 --> 01:14:46.080
that we found there is
actually water in there,

01:14:46.080 --> 01:14:48.304
but it's trapped within
the minerals in the rock.

01:14:48.304 --> 01:14:49.970
People just kind of
assumed that there's

01:14:49.970 --> 01:14:52.100
no water in lunar samples.

01:14:52.100 --> 01:14:56.220
And when I was doing my PhD
I asked this question-- I did

01:14:56.220 --> 01:14:58.599
my PhD on Apollo
samples-- I asked

01:14:58.599 --> 01:14:59.890
this question of my supervisor.

01:14:59.890 --> 01:15:01.970
I said, has anyone
actually really measured

01:15:01.970 --> 01:15:03.520
the water content
of Apollo rocks?

01:15:03.520 --> 01:15:05.353
And he said there's no
need to because there

01:15:05.353 --> 01:15:07.560
isn't any water in them.

01:15:07.560 --> 01:15:09.890
And I just kind of went away
and thought, OK, well he

01:15:09.890 --> 01:15:11.150
knows what he's talking about.

01:15:11.150 --> 01:15:13.330
And it was literally
six months later

01:15:13.330 --> 01:15:16.280
that all this work was published
and he sent me an apology email

01:15:16.280 --> 01:15:20.630
before I even read
the journals online.

01:15:20.630 --> 01:15:22.090
He just sent me--
I opened my inbox

01:15:22.090 --> 01:15:23.150
and he said, Lydia,
I'm so sorry.

01:15:23.150 --> 01:15:24.858
And I thought, what's
he apologizing for?

01:15:24.858 --> 01:15:27.510
And then I went on
the science website

01:15:27.510 --> 01:15:31.020
and I thought, OK, I was right.

01:15:31.020 --> 01:15:33.320
But I would have
been too late anyway.

01:15:33.320 --> 01:15:35.920
But it is true not
only for hydrogen,

01:15:35.920 --> 01:15:38.360
which we couldn't measure
10 years ago because it's

01:15:38.360 --> 01:15:40.570
such a difficult
element to measure,

01:15:40.570 --> 01:15:42.550
but for the oxygen
graph that I showed,

01:15:42.550 --> 01:15:44.400
that's all ion microprobe work.

01:15:44.400 --> 01:15:47.300
So, that kind of
graph determined

01:15:47.300 --> 01:15:49.970
that Martian meteorites
are from Mars,

01:15:49.970 --> 01:15:52.620
we can prove that the
moon and the Earth

01:15:52.620 --> 01:15:56.160
formed from the giant
impact through that data,

01:15:56.160 --> 01:15:57.800
and they're developing
all the time.

01:15:57.800 --> 01:15:59.420
And all the time they're
getting to the point

01:15:59.420 --> 01:16:01.586
where we can measure something
a little bit smaller,

01:16:01.586 --> 01:16:04.140
with a little bit
less content in there,

01:16:04.140 --> 01:16:06.960
a little bit less abundant,
so, parts per billion of things

01:16:06.960 --> 01:16:07.520
now.

01:16:07.520 --> 01:16:10.510
And it really does tell
you from something so tiny

01:16:10.510 --> 01:16:12.400
you can work out how
the solar system formed,

01:16:12.400 --> 01:16:14.260
which is fascinating.

01:16:14.260 --> 01:16:17.744
-So there'll be more of those
kind of incremental discoveries

01:16:17.744 --> 01:16:19.620
that lead us to [INAUDIBLE]

01:16:19.620 --> 01:16:20.560
-I think so, yeah.

01:16:20.560 --> 01:16:22.980
I think it is a technological
advancement, really.

01:16:22.980 --> 01:16:24.580
An explosion.

01:16:24.580 --> 01:16:29.150
-You also have to have somebody
who's going to ask a question,

01:16:29.150 --> 01:16:31.340
or at least be willing to
ask the question, right.

01:16:31.340 --> 01:16:31.630
-Yeah.

01:16:31.630 --> 01:16:33.630
-If you don't have a
person asking the question,

01:16:33.630 --> 01:16:36.210
all the machinery in the
world isn't going to help you.

01:16:36.210 --> 01:16:38.140
-True.

01:16:38.140 --> 01:16:42.450
-I just want to follow the last
question, any possible to use

01:16:42.450 --> 01:16:43.390
laser ablation?

01:16:43.390 --> 01:16:45.550
Much cheaper, much simple.

01:16:45.550 --> 01:16:50.080
And I know people have been
using for oxygen to do that,

01:16:50.080 --> 01:16:52.750
because this is much
cheaper way and also

01:16:52.750 --> 01:16:56.390
much simple instrumentation.

01:16:56.390 --> 01:16:57.670
-For oxygen?

01:16:57.670 --> 01:16:58.670
-Laser ablation.

01:16:58.670 --> 01:16:59.880
-Laser ablation.

01:16:59.880 --> 01:17:04.190
Yes, so laser ablation
is great for looking

01:17:04.190 --> 01:17:07.780
at different isotopes of things
if you want to make a larger

01:17:07.780 --> 01:17:09.610
hole in your sample.

01:17:09.610 --> 01:17:13.160
But it is, it's
getting to the point

01:17:13.160 --> 01:17:16.750
where the spot size is
about 20 microns now,

01:17:16.750 --> 01:17:19.060
the smallest, I think,
for laser ablation.

01:17:19.060 --> 01:17:20.570
-It's true.

01:17:20.570 --> 01:17:25.340
-But that's still too large for
the samples that I looked at.

01:17:25.340 --> 01:17:29.720
The actual spot size on my
sample was around 8 microns.

01:17:29.720 --> 01:17:31.620
And that was on the,
they were really

01:17:31.620 --> 01:17:34.390
on the limit of how large
those inclusions were.

01:17:34.390 --> 01:17:37.050
Because we didn't want to
get any of the material

01:17:37.050 --> 01:17:38.850
from the surrounding
olivine in there.

01:17:38.850 --> 01:17:41.540
So we wanted to hit the
middle of the samples.

01:17:41.540 --> 01:17:43.440
But laser ablation
is definitely,

01:17:43.440 --> 01:17:45.380
it's coming to the point
where, you're right,

01:17:45.380 --> 01:17:48.020
it's much cheaper,
it's much smaller,

01:17:48.020 --> 01:17:50.960
and you can measure more
than one element a time.

01:17:50.960 --> 01:17:53.920
You can get the whole spectrum
of elements at the same time.

01:17:53.920 --> 01:17:59.765
The problem is for hydrogen you
can't use it because hydrogen

01:17:59.765 --> 01:18:01.470
is so volatile.

01:18:01.470 --> 01:18:04.440
It doesn't have the
high vacuum chamber

01:18:04.440 --> 01:18:07.950
that the ion microprobe has.

01:18:07.950 --> 01:18:11.100
And also, it doesn't
have the resolution

01:18:11.100 --> 01:18:14.170
that you can tell between,
for example, deuterium

01:18:14.170 --> 01:18:17.760
has an atomic mass of two, but
so does molecular hydrogen.

01:18:17.760 --> 01:18:24.390
So you need that huge
electromagnet to separate out

01:18:24.390 --> 01:18:28.180
the different atomic masses.

01:18:28.180 --> 01:18:33.170
So laser ablation at the moment
can't do that I don't think.

01:18:33.170 --> 01:18:35.870
-And I have one more question.

01:18:35.870 --> 01:18:38.380
I assume your sample
all from MORB, right?

01:18:38.380 --> 01:18:40.651
It's not from [INAUDIBLE] or--

01:18:40.651 --> 01:18:41.650
-It's from where, sorry?

01:18:41.650 --> 01:18:43.990
-From MORB.

01:18:43.990 --> 01:18:44.540
-From MORB.

01:18:44.540 --> 01:18:46.900
-Mid-ocean ridge basalt.

01:18:46.900 --> 01:18:49.930
-Oh, right, right, right.

01:18:49.930 --> 01:18:51.580
-Because those is,
they have water

01:18:51.580 --> 01:18:54.370
circulated, subduction zone.

01:18:54.370 --> 01:18:56.680
It's not true for mantle water.

01:18:56.680 --> 01:19:00.236
-Yeah, I didn't measure
the MORB samples.

01:19:00.236 --> 01:19:03.470
They're samples that were
standard samples that

01:19:03.470 --> 01:19:05.230
had been measured
elsewhere that I just

01:19:05.230 --> 01:19:07.630
used as standard samples.

01:19:07.630 --> 01:19:10.040
The paper that really
focused on those,

01:19:10.040 --> 01:19:14.100
I forget, actually, the name of
the author who measured them.

01:19:14.100 --> 01:19:16.170
But that was quite a
recent paper as well.

01:19:16.170 --> 01:19:18.870
I'm not sure where they
got their samples from.

01:19:18.870 --> 01:19:21.580
-But I assume is from
mid-ocean ridge basalt,

01:19:21.580 --> 01:19:25.190
otherwise it's not
direct from mantle.

01:19:25.190 --> 01:19:26.915
-It's from the surface, yeah.

01:19:26.915 --> 01:19:28.130
It will be from the surface.

01:19:28.130 --> 01:19:30.530
It's not from a
deep mantle sample.

01:19:30.530 --> 01:19:33.250
But I think they
are fresh samples,

01:19:33.250 --> 01:19:37.380
so they're actually quite
fresh pillow lava samples,

01:19:37.380 --> 01:19:40.450
so they're not contaminated
by things like sea water.

01:19:40.450 --> 01:19:44.130
You can measure, for example,
the chlorine and potassium

01:19:44.130 --> 01:19:48.490
isotope ratio of the
glass in the sample

01:19:48.490 --> 01:19:51.000
will tell you whether
things like ocean water

01:19:51.000 --> 01:19:53.030
have affected the
chemistry of the rock.

01:19:53.030 --> 01:19:56.770
So you avoid any kind of
contamination from seawater.

01:19:56.770 --> 01:19:58.770
-Yeah, that's true if
your rock sample coming

01:19:58.770 --> 01:20:02.640
from [INAUDIBLE] or
[INAUDIBLE], those samples

01:20:02.640 --> 01:20:04.820
come from subduction
zone and there's

01:20:04.820 --> 01:20:08.190
water circulated from seawater.

01:20:08.190 --> 01:20:09.200
-For the MORB samples.

01:20:09.200 --> 01:20:09.700
Yeah.

01:20:09.700 --> 01:20:12.270
-Yeah, and I also
heard you mention

01:20:12.270 --> 01:20:14.720
there's not plate
tectonics on other planet.

01:20:14.720 --> 01:20:17.920
Is this your--

01:20:17.920 --> 01:20:19.820
-No, I said there's--

01:20:19.820 --> 01:20:23.585
-Because there are people
now study plate tectonic

01:20:23.585 --> 01:20:25.180
on other planet.

01:20:25.180 --> 01:20:29.360
-There's no plate tectonics
on any other planet.

01:20:29.360 --> 01:20:34.820
On Mars there is abortive, kind
of, abortive plate tectonics.

01:20:34.820 --> 01:20:38.820
So, it kind of started
to begin, but it

01:20:38.820 --> 01:20:40.670
didn't break through the crust.

01:20:40.670 --> 01:20:43.000
It's a wrinkling of the crust.

01:20:43.000 --> 01:20:45.140
But there's no evidence
that it actually

01:20:45.140 --> 01:20:48.020
went down into the mantle
and any kind of circulation

01:20:48.020 --> 01:20:48.800
started.

01:20:48.800 --> 01:20:53.500
And I think that's because
Mars didn't have enough water.

01:20:53.500 --> 01:20:55.950
So, it had enough
water early on,

01:20:55.950 --> 01:20:57.750
but I don't think it
quite had enough water

01:20:57.750 --> 01:21:02.730
to lubricate the system and
get full blown plate tectonics.

01:21:02.730 --> 01:21:04.730
Venus doesn't have
any plate tectonics,

01:21:04.730 --> 01:21:06.910
and Mercury doesn't have
any plate tectonics.

01:21:06.910 --> 01:21:09.540
There's no plate tectonics
on any asteroid or body

01:21:09.540 --> 01:21:10.450
that we know of.

01:21:10.450 --> 01:21:14.210
But if there is a planet around
another sun somewhere that

01:21:14.210 --> 01:21:17.960
has a lot of water,
there's no reason

01:21:17.960 --> 01:21:20.640
why there couldn't be plate
tectonics on that planet

01:21:20.640 --> 01:21:22.505
as far as I know.

01:21:22.505 --> 01:21:23.130
-OK, thank you.

01:21:23.130 --> 01:21:24.713
We have another question for--

01:21:24.713 --> 01:21:28.660
-We should go to someone else.

01:21:28.660 --> 01:21:33.120
Try to spread around
the-- spread it around.

01:21:33.120 --> 01:21:35.510
-I have a question for you Ben.

01:21:35.510 --> 01:21:38.820
I'm interested in
microbial life in the sea.

01:21:38.820 --> 01:21:44.672
And the express trains
that you described

01:21:44.672 --> 01:21:46.130
are really interesting
for thinking

01:21:46.130 --> 01:21:49.230
about the flow of microbial
life within the ocean.

01:21:49.230 --> 01:21:54.870
And I thought at one point you
said that the Arctic Basin was,

01:21:54.870 --> 01:21:58.160
like, a closed system,
and then that these things

01:21:58.160 --> 01:22:00.820
flow in and maybe flow out.

01:22:00.820 --> 01:22:03.630
But then I thought you were
suggesting that now maybe you

01:22:03.630 --> 01:22:06.970
think the currents
don't go that far?

01:22:06.970 --> 01:22:07.900
-They do.

01:22:07.900 --> 01:22:10.990
I presented a, kind of, a
little simplified picture

01:22:10.990 --> 01:22:12.440
of what was going on out there.

01:22:12.440 --> 01:22:14.410
The thing about the
Arctic is, for the kind

01:22:14.410 --> 01:22:18.040
of scales of current to warm
inflow, and these dense water

01:22:18.040 --> 01:22:20.820
outflows, the
sub-Arctic Nordic Seas

01:22:20.820 --> 01:22:22.670
is the kind of key
exchange region.

01:22:22.670 --> 01:22:26.080
Some of this Gulf Stream water
does go into the Arctic Ocean.

01:22:26.080 --> 01:22:27.610
And, actually,
once it gets there,

01:22:27.610 --> 01:22:30.420
it kind of dives down
below the freshwater.

01:22:30.420 --> 01:22:31.680
So it's actually subsurface.

01:22:31.680 --> 01:22:34.880
It's, kind of, 100, 200 meters
down in the Arctic Ocean.

01:22:34.880 --> 01:22:37.490
So, if you go into the Arctic
and drill through the ice

01:22:37.490 --> 01:22:39.310
and look down, you end
up with fresh water

01:22:39.310 --> 01:22:42.260
on top of salty, warm
water, and then it goes down

01:22:42.260 --> 01:22:43.450
to cold at the bottom.

01:22:43.450 --> 01:22:44.770
So, yeah, it does enter.

01:22:44.770 --> 01:22:48.500
And there is fresher
water that flows out

01:22:48.500 --> 01:22:50.750
through the Canadian
archipelago, much shallower,

01:22:50.750 --> 01:22:52.530
and out through the--
most of the water

01:22:52.530 --> 01:22:54.940
comes in through the
Bering Strait, actually,

01:22:54.940 --> 01:22:56.092
to the Arctic.

01:22:56.092 --> 01:22:59.466
-And do the-- does a
microbiologist ever,

01:22:59.466 --> 01:23:02.484
like, say to you,
while you're out there,

01:23:02.484 --> 01:23:04.820
can you collect a
few samples for us?

01:23:04.820 --> 01:23:05.390
-Absolutely.

01:23:05.390 --> 01:23:08.140
I was involved in a
project up in the Chukchi

01:23:08.140 --> 01:23:13.984
Sea just north west of Alaska, a
very shallow sea, 50 meter sea.

01:23:13.984 --> 01:23:15.650
And the whole project
was around joining

01:23:15.650 --> 01:23:18.570
the dots between the physics,
the sea ice dynamics,

01:23:18.570 --> 01:23:20.420
and the biology of the region.

01:23:20.420 --> 01:23:23.930
So we had teams looking at
how the currents were bringing

01:23:23.930 --> 01:23:26.930
nutrients into the region,
how the ice was actually now

01:23:26.930 --> 01:23:30.670
becoming so thin that light
can actually penetrate through

01:23:30.670 --> 01:23:32.550
and so maybe
phytoplankton can start

01:23:32.550 --> 01:23:36.460
to bloom underneath the ice
before people had previously

01:23:36.460 --> 01:23:37.890
thought it was
possible up there.

01:23:37.890 --> 01:23:40.820
So, yeah, again, back to
the interdisciplinary nature

01:23:40.820 --> 01:23:44.250
of especially oceanography,
all of the key discoveries

01:23:44.250 --> 01:23:47.740
we're going to make are at the
boundaries between physics,

01:23:47.740 --> 01:23:51.272
biology, chemistry, geology, ice
dynamics, those kind of things.

01:23:51.272 --> 01:23:52.480
-I've got a question up here.

01:23:58.900 --> 01:24:01.180
-Hi, my question is for Ben.

01:24:01.180 --> 01:24:04.160
And it's on the flip
side of climate change.

01:24:04.160 --> 01:24:07.140
So the question is, is there
anybody even tentatively

01:24:07.140 --> 01:24:10.700
thinking about ocean currents
and temperature gradients

01:24:10.700 --> 01:24:14.300
as potential sources of energy?

01:24:14.300 --> 01:24:19.770
-Yeah, I think there
is some thoughts.

01:24:19.770 --> 01:24:21.360
I don't know specifics
on this, but I

01:24:21.360 --> 01:24:26.480
have heard people discuss a
possibility of using turbines

01:24:26.480 --> 01:24:27.729
on ocean currents.

01:24:27.729 --> 01:24:29.520
I'm not sure how fruitful
it's going to be.

01:24:29.520 --> 01:24:32.020
I know that you can actually,
technically, theoretically

01:24:32.020 --> 01:24:35.230
extract energy from the
thermal gradient in the ocean,

01:24:35.230 --> 01:24:37.660
but I don't think people
are thinking about this

01:24:37.660 --> 01:24:39.940
on a really big scale.

01:24:39.940 --> 01:24:43.230
I think we have some much
better, practical options

01:24:43.230 --> 01:24:45.100
on land and in coastal
environments where

01:24:45.100 --> 01:24:46.944
we have a lot of readily
available energy.

01:24:50.660 --> 01:24:52.100
-Yeah.

01:24:52.100 --> 01:24:53.540
[INAUDIBLE]

01:24:53.540 --> 01:24:57.980
-OK

01:24:57.980 --> 01:25:00.100
-In your talk you
gave us a criterion

01:25:00.100 --> 01:25:04.879
to determine when water came
into the Earth's system.

01:25:04.879 --> 01:25:07.170
Wouldn't there be another
way of looking at the problem

01:25:07.170 --> 01:25:10.700
and answering it which is,
when and where did conditions

01:25:10.700 --> 01:25:16.050
obtain for the synthesis of
water from oxygen and hydrogen?

01:25:16.050 --> 01:25:22.340
-Yes, so I mentioned about the
molecular cloud earlier on.

01:25:22.340 --> 01:25:26.960
So astronomers, which
I am not an astronomer,

01:25:26.960 --> 01:25:30.490
they assure me that there was
water in the molecular cloud

01:25:30.490 --> 01:25:31.940
before the sun formed.

01:25:31.940 --> 01:25:36.520
So that cloud of dust and gas
contained molecules of water.

01:25:36.520 --> 01:25:40.100
So we don't need to wait
for things to cool down

01:25:40.100 --> 01:25:42.880
after the sun's formation for
the oxygen and the hydrogen

01:25:42.880 --> 01:25:45.820
to come together to form
water, it's already there.

01:25:45.820 --> 01:25:48.240
It's immediately available.

01:25:48.240 --> 01:25:51.320
And the Earth doesn't, it's
not one of the first planets

01:25:51.320 --> 01:25:51.820
to form.

01:25:51.820 --> 01:25:56.620
So I showed that graph with
the giant planets moving in,

01:25:56.620 --> 01:25:58.650
Jupiter begins to
form first, then

01:25:58.650 --> 01:26:01.570
Saturn, then Uranus and
Neptune form after that.

01:26:01.570 --> 01:26:03.170
And it's only once
those giant planets

01:26:03.170 --> 01:26:06.510
are formed, around four
or five million years

01:26:06.510 --> 01:26:11.080
after the solar system formed,
that they begin to migrate in.

01:26:11.080 --> 01:26:13.750
And then you get the terrestrial
rocky planets forming.

01:26:13.750 --> 01:26:15.500
So they're actually
quite late comers

01:26:15.500 --> 01:26:17.570
in terms of solar
system formation,

01:26:17.570 --> 01:26:21.320
it's kind of the last
big bodies that form.

01:26:21.320 --> 01:26:24.640
So you'd expect that things
had kind of settled down

01:26:24.640 --> 01:26:29.510
a little bit in terms of oxygen
and molecules forming together.

01:26:29.510 --> 01:26:34.080
You've already got solids in
the solar system by that point.

01:26:34.080 --> 01:26:39.060
-OK so now it's time
for our reception.

01:26:39.060 --> 01:26:42.310
So I'd like to thank
all of the speakers.
