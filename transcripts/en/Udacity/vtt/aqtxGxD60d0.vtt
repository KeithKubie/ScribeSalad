00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:03.400
Information that we have available is that on

00:00:03.400 --> 00:00:06.770
some processor pu, the queue contains a task

00:00:06.770 --> 00:00:10.590
tx. On another processor, pv, the queue contains

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:14.350
four threads. Tm, tq, tr, and tn, so

00:00:14.350 --> 00:00:16.350
these are these are the threads on pv's

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:19.490
queue. And there's a particular thread, Ty, the

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:23.060
affinity of Ty with respect to Pu, is

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:26.340
2. This is the intervening thread index, and

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:28.100
I mentioned to you that the smaller the

00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:31.920
index, the higher the affinity. So PuI for Ty

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:36.960
is two, and similarly Pu, PvI For T

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:40.690
y is one. There's a number of intervening tasks

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:46.100
that have run on the process of P u and P v respectively since the last time

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:48.560
T y had a chance to run on these

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:51.850
processes. And the scheduling policy we're going to pick

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:56.550
is the minimum intervening plus q. Minimum intervening plus

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:59.050
q, that's a scheduling policy that we're going to pick.

00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:01.620
So, given that this is a scheduling policy, when

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:04.790
we decide at the point that Qi gets to run

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:11.070
again, when it is ready to be put on a Q, which Q will I put Ty on, if

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:14.330
the scheduling policy is minimum intervening plus Q? Is

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:16.870
it Pu's Q or is Pv's Q those are the

00:01:16.870 --> 00:01:18.280
two choices available to you.
