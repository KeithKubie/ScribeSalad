00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:03.980
Here's our quadratic formula written out once again, and I've written the

00:00:03.980 --> 00:00:08.052
discriminant b squared minus 4ac in teal. It's important to note that we're

00:00:08.052 --> 00:00:12.148
taking the square root of this number, and as we've said many times before, we

00:00:12.148 --> 00:00:16.500
only know how to take the square root of non-negative numbers, non-negative real

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:21.062
numbers to be exact. So if we have a negative number under here, we're not going

00:00:21.062 --> 00:00:25.299
to get any real solutions. However, we need to make another distinction among

00:00:25.299 --> 00:00:29.400
the numbers that do give us real solutions. If we have a 0 under here, then we

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:33.366
only get 1 real solution. Since we'll have negative b plus or minus 0, and

00:00:33.366 --> 00:00:37.721
either adding or subtracting zero from negative b gives us the same number, just

00:00:37.721 --> 00:00:42.176
negative b. So we would just get negative b over 2a. If the discriminant is 0.

00:00:42.176 --> 00:00:46.333
That's only 1 answer. This is only 1 number. It's our plus or minus, which is

00:00:46.333 --> 00:00:50.687
what split this into 2 solutions originally, is no longer doing that for us. If

00:00:50.687 --> 00:00:54.587
b squared minus 4ac is positive, then we'll get some real number here and

00:00:54.587 --> 00:00:59.066
negative b plus that number will be different from negative b minus that number.

00:00:59.066 --> 00:01:03.288
So in that case we will wind up with 2 roots, two positions where we know that

00:01:03.288 --> 00:01:04.998
our parabola hits the x axis.
