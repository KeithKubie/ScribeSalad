00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:01.819
so I have a very simple equation written

00:00:01.819 --> 00:00:01.829
so I have a very simple equation written
 

00:00:01.829 --> 00:00:05.180
so I have a very simple equation written
here a plus B is equal to C and what I

00:00:05.180 --> 00:00:05.190
here a plus B is equal to C and what I
 

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:07.700
here a plus B is equal to C and what I
want to think about if we know that a is

00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:07.710
want to think about if we know that a is
 

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:09.860
want to think about if we know that a is
an integer so let's say that this is the

00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:09.870
an integer so let's say that this is the
 

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:12.940
an integer so let's say that this is the
set of all integers right over here

00:00:12.940 --> 00:00:12.950
set of all integers right over here
 

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:16.700
set of all integers right over here
integers we know that a is an integer so

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:16.710
integers we know that a is an integer so
 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:19.460
integers we know that a is an integer so
let's say that's a there we also know

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:19.470
let's say that's a there we also know
 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:21.200
let's say that's a there we also know
that B is an integer it could be the

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:21.210
that B is an integer it could be the
 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:22.910
that B is an integer it could be the
same integer but I'll draw it so it

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:22.920
same integer but I'll draw it so it
 

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:24.200
same integer but I'll draw it so it
looks like it's another one but doesn't

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:24.210
looks like it's another one but doesn't
 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:25.429
looks like it's another one but doesn't
have to be they could be the same

00:00:25.429 --> 00:00:25.439
have to be they could be the same
 

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:27.890
have to be they could be the same
integer B is an integer if we're adding

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:27.900
integer B is an integer if we're adding
 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:30.200
integer B is an integer if we're adding
these two integers are we definitely

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:30.210
these two integers are we definitely
 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:32.450
these two integers are we definitely
going to get another integer do we know

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:32.460
going to get another integer do we know
 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:36.260
going to get another integer do we know
that C is going to be an integer and I

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:36.270
that C is going to be an integer and I
 

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:37.520
that C is going to be an integer and I
encourage you to pause the video and

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:37.530
encourage you to pause the video and
 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:39.170
encourage you to pause the video and
think about it well when you thought

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:39.180
think about it well when you thought
 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:40.400
think about it well when you thought
about you might have come up with some

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:40.410
about you might have come up with some
 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:42.110
about you might have come up with some
cases well what if a and B are both 1

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:42.120
cases well what if a and B are both 1
 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:44.900
cases well what if a and B are both 1
then for sure C is going to be 2 and C

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:44.910
then for sure C is going to be 2 and C
 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:46.220
then for sure C is going to be 2 and C
is going to be an integer well is that

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:46.230
is going to be an integer well is that
 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:48.680
is going to be an integer well is that
always going to be the case well it is

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:48.690
always going to be the case well it is
 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:50.299
always going to be the case well it is
there are ways to prove it I'm not going

00:00:50.299 --> 00:00:50.309
there are ways to prove it I'm not going
 

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:52.160
there are ways to prove it I'm not going
to go into it now but when you have a

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:52.170
to go into it now but when you have a
 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:53.810
to go into it now but when you have a
situation like this when you're able to

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:53.820
situation like this when you're able to
 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:55.670
situation like this when you're able to
take two members of a set in this case

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:55.680
take two members of a set in this case
 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:57.740
take two members of a set in this case
two members of a set and perform an

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:57.750
two members of a set and perform an
 

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:00.439
two members of a set and perform an
operation on it and always get another

00:01:00.439 --> 00:01:00.449
operation on it and always get another
 

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:02.959
operation on it and always get another
member of the set and it could be a or B

00:01:02.959 --> 00:01:02.969
member of the set and it could be a or B
 

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:05.210
member of the set and it could be a or B
again or it could be another distinct

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:05.220
again or it could be another distinct
 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:07.399
again or it could be another distinct
member of the set I'll draw it as

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:07.409
member of the set I'll draw it as
 

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:09.020
member of the set I'll draw it as
another distinct member of the set

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:09.030
another distinct member of the set
 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:11.960
another distinct member of the set
whenever you have this so you have some

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:11.970
whenever you have this so you have some
 

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:14.510
whenever you have this so you have some
operation in this case it is addition so

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:14.520
operation in this case it is addition so
 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:15.830
operation in this case it is addition so
when you're performing the addition

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:15.840
when you're performing the addition
 

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:18.530
when you're performing the addition
operation on two members of the set you

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:18.540
operation on two members of the set you
 

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:21.560
operation on two members of the set you
get you stay in the set C is also going

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:21.570
get you stay in the set C is also going
 

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:24.020
get you stay in the set C is also going
to be a member of that set so one way to

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:24.030
to be a member of that set so one way to
 

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:25.850
to be a member of that set so one way to
think about it we're going we're going

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:25.860
think about it we're going we're going
 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:28.609
think about it we're going we're going
like this and we are performing this

00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:28.619
like this and we are performing this
 

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:30.620
like this and we are performing this
addition operation whenever you see a

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:30.630
addition operation whenever you see a
 

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:33.590
addition operation whenever you see a
circumstance like this we call we say

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:33.600
circumstance like this we call we say
 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:36.710
circumstance like this we call we say
that this set the set of integers is

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:36.720
that this set the set of integers is
 

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:39.319
that this set the set of integers is
closed under addition let me write that

00:01:39.319 --> 00:01:39.329
closed under addition let me write that
 

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:43.389
closed under addition let me write that
down so this means that the set of

00:01:43.389 --> 00:01:43.399
down so this means that the set of
 

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:52.100
down so this means that the set of
integers integers is closed under under

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:52.110
integers integers is closed under under
 

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:54.889
integers integers is closed under under
addition so once again you're going to

00:01:54.889 --> 00:01:54.899
addition so once again you're going to
 

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:58.039
addition so once again you're going to
hear this idea of closure as the general

00:01:58.039 --> 00:01:58.049
hear this idea of closure as the general
 

00:01:58.049 --> 00:01:59.630
hear this idea of closure as the general
term that we're talking about is closure

00:01:59.630 --> 00:01:59.640
term that we're talking about is closure
 

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:02.209
term that we're talking about is closure
when you take some especially higher

00:02:02.209 --> 00:02:02.219
when you take some especially higher
 

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:03.380
when you take some especially higher
mathematics course but you might even

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:03.390
mathematics course but you might even
 

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:04.940
mathematics course but you might even
hear it in some of your high school

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:04.950
hear it in some of your high school
 

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:06.709
hear it in some of your high school
courses and it might seem like this

00:02:06.709 --> 00:02:06.719
courses and it might seem like this
 

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:08.960
courses and it might seem like this
really advanced thing but all it's

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:08.970
really advanced thing but all it's
 

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:10.999
really advanced thing but all it's
saying is you have a set you have some

00:02:10.999 --> 00:02:11.009
saying is you have a set you have some
 

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:12.470
saying is you have a set you have some
operation that you can perform on

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:12.480
operation that you can perform on
 

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:13.120
operation that you can perform on
members of

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:13.130
members of
 

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:14.890
members of
set and if every time you perform that

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:14.900
set and if every time you perform that
 

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:16.330
set and if every time you perform that
operation on members of the set you get

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:16.340
operation on members of the set you get
 

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:18.850
operation on members of the set you get
you stay in the set the result is a

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:18.860
you stay in the set the result is a
 

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:21.220
you stay in the set the result is a
member of the set then you say that the

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:21.230
member of the set then you say that the
 

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:24.010
member of the set then you say that the
set is closed under that operation the

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:24.020
set is closed under that operation the
 

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:26.620
set is closed under that operation the
set is closed in this case the operation

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:26.630
set is closed in this case the operation
 

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:28.750
set is closed in this case the operation
is addition you say the set is closed

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:28.760
is addition you say the set is closed
 

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:30.700
is addition you say the set is closed
under addition and we can ask ourselves

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:30.710
under addition and we can ask ourselves
 

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:32.650
under addition and we can ask ourselves
that same question about other things is

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:32.660
that same question about other things is
 

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:39.880
that same question about other things is
the set of is the set of integers closed

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:39.890
the set of is the set of integers closed
 

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:43.870
the set of is the set of integers closed
under closed under actually let's take

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:43.880
under closed under actually let's take
 

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:45.520
under closed under actually let's take
some examples is it closed under

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:45.530
some examples is it closed under
 

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:50.350
some examples is it closed under
multiplication multi-application and i

00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:50.360
multiplication multi-application and i
 

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:51.730
multiplication multi-application and i
encourage you to pause the video and

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:51.740
encourage you to pause the video and
 

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:54.130
encourage you to pause the video and
think about it and then think about is

00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:54.140
think about it and then think about is
 

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:57.310
think about it and then think about is
it closed under division is it closed

00:02:57.310 --> 00:02:57.320
it closed under division is it closed
 

00:02:57.320 --> 00:03:00.100
it closed under division is it closed
under division is it closed under

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:00.110
under division is it closed under
 

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:04.420
under division is it closed under
subtraction is it closed under

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:04.430
subtraction is it closed under
 

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:05.650
subtraction is it closed under
subtraction I encourage you to think

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:05.660
subtraction I encourage you to think
 

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:06.730
subtraction I encourage you to think
about all these different operations

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:06.740
about all these different operations
 

00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:08.200
about all these different operations
let's take them one by one

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:08.210
let's take them one by one
 

00:03:08.210 --> 00:03:10.090
let's take them one by one
multiplication if you take two integers

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:10.100
multiplication if you take two integers
 

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:12.190
multiplication if you take two integers
and you were to multiply it you actually

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:12.200
and you were to multiply it you actually
 

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:14.980
and you were to multiply it you actually
will always get another integer so the

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:14.990
will always get another integer so the
 

00:03:14.990 --> 00:03:17.230
will always get another integer so the
set of integers is closed under

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:17.240
set of integers is closed under
 

00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:18.160
set of integers is closed under
multiplication

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:18.170
multiplication
 

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:20.740
multiplication
now what about division well it's very

00:03:20.740 --> 00:03:20.750
now what about division well it's very
 

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:23.260
now what about division well it's very
easy to prove a case in which I'm up I'm

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:23.270
easy to prove a case in which I'm up I'm
 

00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:25.120
easy to prove a case in which I'm up I'm
dividing two integers and not getting

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:25.130
dividing two integers and not getting
 

00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:27.990
dividing two integers and not getting
another integer for example I could say

00:03:27.990 --> 00:03:28.000
another integer for example I could say
 

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:32.050
another integer for example I could say
let me just do a very simple 1 1 divided

00:03:32.050 --> 00:03:32.060
let me just do a very simple 1 1 divided
 

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:34.630
let me just do a very simple 1 1 divided
by 2 1 &amp; 2 are both integers but what's

00:03:34.630 --> 00:03:34.640
by 2 1 &amp; 2 are both integers but what's
 

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:36.190
by 2 1 &amp; 2 are both integers but what's
that going to give me that's going to

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:36.200
that going to give me that's going to
 

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:39.520
that going to give me that's going to
give me 1/2 which is not another integer

00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:39.530
give me 1/2 which is not another integer
 

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:41.290
give me 1/2 which is not another integer
this is a rational number but not an

00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:41.300
this is a rational number but not an
 

00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:43.630
this is a rational number but not an
integer so if we were to extend our sets

00:03:43.630 --> 00:03:43.640
integer so if we were to extend our sets
 

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:45.220
integer so if we were to extend our sets
right over here all integers are also

00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:45.230
right over here all integers are also
 

00:03:45.230 --> 00:03:46.900
right over here all integers are also
rational but all rationals are not

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:46.910
rational but all rationals are not
 

00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:49.420
rational but all rationals are not
integers necessarily so this is

00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:49.430
integers necessarily so this is
 

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:52.390
integers necessarily so this is
irrational rational numbers here this

00:03:52.390 --> 00:03:52.400
irrational rational numbers here this
 

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:56.710
irrational rational numbers here this
case of 1/2 so that's 1 and this is 2

00:03:56.710 --> 00:03:56.720
case of 1/2 so that's 1 and this is 2
 

00:03:56.720 --> 00:03:59.500
case of 1/2 so that's 1 and this is 2
when we performed division we went out

00:03:59.500 --> 00:03:59.510
when we performed division we went out
 

00:03:59.510 --> 00:04:02.230
when we performed division we went out
of the set so when we performed division

00:04:02.230 --> 00:04:02.240
of the set so when we performed division
 

00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:04.180
of the set so when we performed division
we went out of that set to something

00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:04.190
we went out of that set to something
 

00:04:04.190 --> 00:04:05.620
we went out of that set to something
that's not an integer but it is a

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:05.630
that's not an integer but it is a
 

00:04:05.630 --> 00:04:07.840
that's not an integer but it is a
rational number so the set of integers

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:07.850
rational number so the set of integers
 

00:04:07.850 --> 00:04:11.410
rational number so the set of integers
is not closed under division subtraction

00:04:11.410 --> 00:04:11.420
is not closed under division subtraction
 

00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:13.540
is not closed under division subtraction
sure and once again I'm not going to

00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:13.550
sure and once again I'm not going to
 

00:04:13.550 --> 00:04:15.100
sure and once again I'm not going to
rigorously prove it here but take any

00:04:15.100 --> 00:04:15.110
rigorously prove it here but take any
 

00:04:15.110 --> 00:04:17.770
rigorously prove it here but take any
two integers you indeed are going to get

00:04:17.770 --> 00:04:17.780
two integers you indeed are going to get
 

00:04:17.780 --> 00:04:20.860
two integers you indeed are going to get
another you are going to get a another

00:04:20.860 --> 00:04:20.870
another you are going to get a another
 

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:23.530
another you are going to get a another
integer so the whole idea here is to

00:04:23.530 --> 00:04:23.540
integer so the whole idea here is to
 

00:04:23.540 --> 00:04:25.420
integer so the whole idea here is to
just give you a brief introduction to

00:04:25.420 --> 00:04:25.430
just give you a brief introduction to
 

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:26.530
just give you a brief introduction to
the notion

00:04:26.530 --> 00:04:26.540
the notion
 

00:04:26.540 --> 00:04:29.650
the notion
of closure the idea that if you have a

00:04:29.650 --> 00:04:29.660
of closure the idea that if you have a
 

00:04:29.660 --> 00:04:31.990
of closure the idea that if you have a
set and if you perform an operation on

00:04:31.990 --> 00:04:32.000
set and if you perform an operation on
 

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:34.330
set and if you perform an operation on
members of that set and you always get a

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:34.340
members of that set and you always get a
 

00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:36.460
members of that set and you always get a
member of your original set then that

00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:36.470
member of your original set then that
 

00:04:36.470 --> 00:04:39.130
member of your original set then that
then that set is closed under that

00:04:39.130 --> 00:04:39.140
then that set is closed under that
 

00:04:39.140 --> 00:04:41.080
then that set is closed under that
operation now what did Matt what matters

00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:41.090
operation now what did Matt what matters
 

00:04:41.090 --> 00:04:42.310
operation now what did Matt what matters
is is the set that you're talking about

00:04:42.310 --> 00:04:42.320
is is the set that you're talking about
 

00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:43.150
is is the set that you're talking about
in this case we talked a lot about

00:04:43.150 --> 00:04:43.160
in this case we talked a lot about
 

00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:44.950
in this case we talked a lot about
integers and we talked about addition

00:04:44.950 --> 00:04:44.960
integers and we talked about addition
 

00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:46.840
integers and we talked about addition
multiplication division subtraction but

00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:46.850
multiplication division subtraction but
 

00:04:46.850 --> 00:04:48.460
multiplication division subtraction but
you could think about the set of

00:04:48.460 --> 00:04:48.470
you could think about the set of
 

00:04:48.470 --> 00:04:50.380
you could think about the set of
polynomials and whether they are closed

00:04:50.380 --> 00:04:50.390
polynomials and whether they are closed
 

00:04:50.390 --> 00:04:52.450
polynomials and whether they are closed
under addition which they actually are

00:04:52.450 --> 00:04:52.460
under addition which they actually are
 

00:04:52.460 --> 00:04:56.050
under addition which they actually are
or the set of rational numbers are they

00:04:56.050 --> 00:04:56.060
or the set of rational numbers are they
 

00:04:56.060 --> 00:04:59.470
or the set of rational numbers are they
closed under exponentiation there's all

00:04:59.470 --> 00:04:59.480
closed under exponentiation there's all
 

00:04:59.480 --> 00:05:01.060
closed under exponentiation there's all
sorts of things we could think about but

00:05:01.060 --> 00:05:01.070
sorts of things we could think about but
 

00:05:01.070 --> 00:05:02.560
sorts of things we could think about but
hopefully this gives you a good sense of

00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:02.570
hopefully this gives you a good sense of
 

00:05:02.570 --> 00:05:05.380
hopefully this gives you a good sense of
what we mean when we say closure or for

00:05:05.380 --> 00:05:05.390
what we mean when we say closure or for
 

00:05:05.390 --> 00:05:09.880
what we mean when we say closure or for
a set being closed under some operation
