1
00:00:06,070 --> 00:00:06,903
We're

2
00:00:10,830 --> 00:00:15,090
moving on to,
to have and have not.

3
00:00:15,780 --> 00:00:16,410
Um,

4
00:00:16,410 --> 00:00:21,060
and this novel was
written in a fairly have,

5
00:00:21,090 --> 00:00:24,930
has it fashion.
It was written in 19,

6
00:00:24,931 --> 00:00:29,931
between 1935 and 1937 basically,

7
00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:35,220
um, it was written when Hemingway was
taking a break from his coverage of the

8
00:00:35,221 --> 00:00:36,360
Spanish civil war,

9
00:00:36,390 --> 00:00:41,230
so he would be in Spain for Spanish
civil war and then he would, um,

10
00:00:41,310 --> 00:00:45,920
come back, um, to the, uh, United
States, but after they, um,

11
00:00:45,990 --> 00:00:50,930
also to The Bahamas to right
to have and have not. So, uh,

12
00:00:50,940 --> 00:00:55,230
we'll be reading, you guys know that we'll
be reading for whom the bell tolls, um,

13
00:00:55,280 --> 00:01:00,150
for whom the bell tolls and have and
have not really interlocking in multiple

14
00:01:00,151 --> 00:01:04,740
ways because one is balanced pencil awards
and this one's written when Hemingway

15
00:01:04,741 --> 00:01:06,310
was covering the span.
So awards.

16
00:01:06,370 --> 00:01:10,980
So we can really think of those as in
dialogue in really interesting ways.

17
00:01:11,670 --> 00:01:15,240
Um,
the um,

18
00:01:16,110 --> 00:01:18,770
hotel that Hemingway's stayed at,
uh,

19
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:22,650
when he was writing to have and have not,
uh,

20
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:27,660
was in The Bahamas is in the
mini is the conceit Anglo hotel.

21
00:01:27,661 --> 00:01:31,080
Actually, I'm the hotel burned
down, so it's no longer there.

22
00:01:31,081 --> 00:01:35,760
But this was a picture taken before that
was really lucky that there was this

23
00:01:35,761 --> 00:01:40,560
picture. Um, and inside of
there, there's a plaque standard.

24
00:01:40,561 --> 00:01:45,060
This was the home of Ernest Hemingway.
Um, he was there for two years,

25
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:49,890
um, the police road to have and have
not in various different places,

26
00:01:50,220 --> 00:01:54,000
but this was one of the main places
he stayed at when he wrote the novel.

27
00:01:54,660 --> 00:01:58,680
Um, as we also know, Cuba, um,

28
00:01:58,710 --> 00:02:03,600
was very important to Hemingway. Um,
this is, uh, his house is still standing.

29
00:02:03,910 --> 00:02:07,800
The thing that they're here,
um, which is now than Lucio. Um,

30
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:10,320
on this Hemingway in Havana.
Um,

31
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:13,920
and this is a picture
of Hemingway writing.

32
00:02:14,340 --> 00:02:15,540
He wrote the man,

33
00:02:15,630 --> 00:02:19,620
Oh man in the sea when he was
in Cuba in this very house.

34
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:22,890
Roy's books were there. So, um,

35
00:02:23,310 --> 00:02:28,310
but this was Polly picture was polytech
and a little later in the 1950s,

36
00:02:29,250 --> 00:02:29,850
um,

37
00:02:29,850 --> 00:02:34,530
so I found some pictures of
Havana in the 1930 business.

38
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:38,270
The while the frame, this
is the El Malecon, uh,

39
00:02:38,310 --> 00:02:39,850
with the sea war.

40
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:44,090
You can see are there some really
very magnificent buildings, uh,

41
00:02:44,220 --> 00:02:48,270
on the Wallace van.
And this is the main avenue,

42
00:02:48,460 --> 00:02:53,100
the Anita, those president is
very, very impressive looking.

43
00:02:53,490 --> 00:02:54,720
Um,
avenue.

44
00:02:54,810 --> 00:02:59,810
Cuba was actually called the Paris of
the Western in the first half of the 20th

45
00:03:01,901 --> 00:03:06,370
century. And we can see why, uh, it
really was a very magnificent place.

46
00:03:07,210 --> 00:03:11,710
And, um, this is downtown Havana
and still in the thirties. Um,

47
00:03:11,860 --> 00:03:14,980
and this is bothered
Hemingway went to quill,

48
00:03:14,981 --> 00:03:16,920
has the sloppy joes but are,

49
00:03:17,380 --> 00:03:21,840
and here's a picture of him
and the British playwright,

50
00:03:22,070 --> 00:03:25,960
no coward at the sloppy Joes Ball. So, um,

51
00:03:26,290 --> 00:03:29,860
really interesting historic
pictures other than drinking.

52
00:03:30,250 --> 00:03:35,250
Hemingway also went fishing a lot as we
can see as a very intimate knowledge of,

53
00:03:38,330 --> 00:03:42,870
of fishing. And the fish
that especially, uh,

54
00:03:42,940 --> 00:03:45,260
preoccupy him was the mall.

55
00:03:45,261 --> 00:03:49,180
And so this is a description
from to have and have not, um,

56
00:03:49,300 --> 00:03:52,120
of what Amal and look like. And I just
happened to have found this picture,

57
00:03:52,121 --> 00:03:55,180
the single correspondence lag
way through that, the thought,

58
00:03:55,240 --> 00:04:00,240
the eye and open lower jaw and huge
purple black head of a black Marlin from

59
00:04:01,871 --> 00:04:04,990
this picture.
We can't really see how big areas.

60
00:04:05,020 --> 00:04:08,630
This is a picture of Hemingway
on the boat and Nida, um,

61
00:04:08,710 --> 00:04:13,630
this is just before he wrote to have
and have not, um, with his friends.

62
00:04:14,020 --> 00:04:18,100
Um, and the next picture is, um,

63
00:04:18,130 --> 00:04:21,160
taken in the mini,
um,

64
00:04:21,220 --> 00:04:26,180
and with his second wife
Pauline and his three sons,

65
00:04:26,740 --> 00:04:30,610
Gregory, John and Patrick, 19 than five.

66
00:04:30,850 --> 00:04:35,110
And we can see just how
huge a tamale in is.

67
00:04:35,350 --> 00:04:40,010
It could weigh up to a
thousand partners. So, um, the,

68
00:04:40,270 --> 00:04:43,080
this picture is, I downloaded, um,

69
00:04:43,590 --> 00:04:48,590
online things to the Ernest Hemingway
collection at the JFK Library in Boston.

70
00:04:49,640 --> 00:04:53,610
So this is just to acknowledge
a very important collection. Um,

71
00:04:53,710 --> 00:04:57,940
if you guys want to do future work on
him anyway, that's the place to go,

72
00:04:58,680 --> 00:05:03,460
um, is helpful, um, in thinking
about to have and have not,

73
00:05:03,580 --> 00:05:04,000
um,

74
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:09,000
to think a little bit about the
publication district of this novel.

75
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:14,950
It was also publish as short stories.
It's too short stories.

76
00:05:15,370 --> 00:05:15,760
Um,

77
00:05:15,760 --> 00:05:20,760
one trip across was published
in a cosmopolitan 1934.

78
00:05:21,020 --> 00:05:21,610
Um,

79
00:05:21,610 --> 00:05:26,610
and then the traders return publish and
as wired magazine 1936 and then to have

80
00:05:27,341 --> 00:05:32,230
and have not was published
by a Scribner's in 1937. Um,

81
00:05:32,380 --> 00:05:33,460
so,
um,

82
00:05:33,700 --> 00:05:38,700
because of the way it came out
initially as she was stories,

83
00:05:39,220 --> 00:05:44,220
I think once again we have to think about
the narrative structure of the novel

84
00:05:45,490 --> 00:05:48,880
and this a lot to think about because
it turns out that this is an incredibly

85
00:05:48,881 --> 00:05:53,881
complicated switching back and forth
between the first person and third person.

86
00:05:54,970 --> 00:05:59,970
So one is told and the first
person is themes for straight,

87
00:06:00,241 --> 00:06:02,620
straightforward is told from herring.

88
00:06:02,621 --> 00:06:06,770
Morgan's point of view is also the spring,
the session cause spraying.

89
00:06:07,250 --> 00:06:12,020
So, um, it is in many ways the
spring and Harry Morgan's life.

90
00:06:12,650 --> 00:06:13,250
Um,

91
00:06:13,250 --> 00:06:18,250
and then part two is toe
and the third person.

92
00:06:19,420 --> 00:06:22,190
Um,
and this is actually quite Jordan.

93
00:06:22,250 --> 00:06:25,430
All of a sudden we see Harry
more than from the outside. Um,

94
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:27,780
as we knew nothing about him,

95
00:06:27,810 --> 00:06:32,690
his reintroduced to us as
he and even as the man,

96
00:06:33,080 --> 00:06:33,531
the very,

97
00:06:33,531 --> 00:06:38,531
very alienating perspective and part
you and as the section called the fall.

98
00:06:39,230 --> 00:06:41,330
And then part three is called a winter.

99
00:06:41,331 --> 00:06:46,331
And here is even more complicated than
that is mixed narration begins with

100
00:06:47,450 --> 00:06:50,770
someone who's not even a very important
character of someone called [inaudible]

101
00:06:50,780 --> 00:06:54,020
who tells the story in chat tonight.
Um,

102
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:57,680
and then it switches back
to Harry and chapter 10.

103
00:06:57,680 --> 00:07:02,680
And then we get third person narration
for a good part of the part two,

104
00:07:02,870 --> 00:07:07,490
a part three. And then the
very final chapter, Chapter 26,

105
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:11,930
it switches back to the first person
narration, but there's Toba and Marie,

106
00:07:11,960 --> 00:07:14,510
Harry's wife.
Um,

107
00:07:14,540 --> 00:07:19,540
so at the very least we can say that
Hemingway's experimented with all kinds of

108
00:07:20,541 --> 00:07:22,610
narrative who of views.
Um,

109
00:07:22,670 --> 00:07:26,030
and so the most fundamental question,
um,

110
00:07:26,330 --> 00:07:30,670
has to do with pronouns. Um, who
is attached to which pronoun?

111
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:32,780
Why does having way,
uh,

112
00:07:32,900 --> 00:07:37,550
choose to use certain pronouns while the
see choose to use some points of views

113
00:07:37,730 --> 00:07:39,950
for that section.
Um,

114
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:44,660
and this is also a good moment to start
thinking about the interconnections,

115
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:48,800
Amanda Novels. I know that you guys
just turn in your first paper, so,

116
00:07:48,890 --> 00:07:53,030
but there's not too early to start
thinking about the next big project.

117
00:07:53,510 --> 00:07:53,960
Um,

118
00:07:53,960 --> 00:07:58,550
and the interconnections amount of novels
would be a very good approach to thing

119
00:07:58,551 --> 00:08:01,570
about that larger project. So, um,

120
00:08:01,610 --> 00:08:06,610
two things are very clear in terms
of the prior publication as she was

121
00:08:06,940 --> 00:08:11,940
[inaudible] to have and have not
obviously looks back to in our time.

122
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:17,570
There seems to be Hemingway's habit
is to publish publish poets as short

123
00:08:17,571 --> 00:08:19,670
stories. Actually it's very common, uh,

124
00:08:19,730 --> 00:08:24,380
publish pause and short stories and
then to have a more, a larger entity,

125
00:08:24,690 --> 00:08:26,330
um, whether or not, um,

126
00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:30,710
the two are related in terms of this
kind of pry publication history is a good

127
00:08:30,711 --> 00:08:34,940
question. Um, but to have and
have not, it's also linked,

128
00:08:35,160 --> 00:08:35,750
um,

129
00:08:35,750 --> 00:08:40,750
to the sound and the theory because
of the multiple narratives voices,

130
00:08:41,060 --> 00:08:43,790
um, in the sound of the fury, we
know that they are just four, right?

131
00:08:43,791 --> 00:08:48,590
So the three brothers, um, each guest
one section and then the ignition,

132
00:08:48,760 --> 00:08:53,760
a narration in section four and to have
and have not is much less clear cut than

133
00:08:56,011 --> 00:08:57,720
that.
As I just mentioned,

134
00:08:58,260 --> 00:09:02,610
someone who's quite Mojito to a story
like Alvin guests to have a section.

135
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:07,880
So he obviously doesn't have to send
challenged that Benji or Quentin or Jason.

136
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:11,500
Um, there's the three brothers
do in, in Santa Theory. Uh,

137
00:09:11,670 --> 00:09:15,660
why does someone like Albert get
to tell the story? Um, it's um,

138
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:20,720
even though the two novels have share
common ground in terms of multiple

139
00:09:21,630 --> 00:09:25,900
narrative whizzes, the actual
configuration of those voices, um,

140
00:09:26,190 --> 00:09:30,300
the two different configurations
in the two novels. Um,

141
00:09:30,390 --> 00:09:35,390
and finally something new is also
emerging and to half and half,

142
00:09:35,431 --> 00:09:40,431
not that we haven't seen so far or that
hasn't been in the foreground a up to

143
00:09:40,561 --> 00:09:44,580
this point. Then I like to call your
attention to add, which as characters,

144
00:09:44,610 --> 00:09:49,140
as generic types with classification,

145
00:09:49,410 --> 00:09:52,230
with taxonomy of social types,

146
00:09:52,470 --> 00:09:57,470
we see it in the very title of
the novel is divided into two,

147
00:09:58,260 --> 00:10:00,810
the haves and the have nots.
Um,

148
00:10:00,990 --> 00:10:05,960
and obviously to social
types. Um, it's very much, um,

149
00:10:06,060 --> 00:10:09,450
kind of organizing
principle in this novel. Uh,

150
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:14,480
but it also looks forward
to the Fitzgerald stories
that we'll be reading next

151
00:10:16,590 --> 00:10:16,650
week.

152
00:10:16,650 --> 00:10:21,650
A story like the ritual boy is very
much about this kind of classifiable and

153
00:10:22,591 --> 00:10:25,740
generic type.
Um,

154
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:34,170
so, um, I wanted to think about this. Um,

155
00:10:34,760 --> 00:10:38,340
one of the thing about the
difference between two novels, um,

156
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:42,990
in terms of another novel that,
um, that Hemingway is famous for,

157
00:10:43,380 --> 00:10:46,770
which is the old man and the sea.
Um,

158
00:10:49,170 --> 00:10:53,130
and um,
they're both sat in Cuba,

159
00:10:53,131 --> 00:10:55,530
the above about Cuba for some extent,

160
00:10:55,560 --> 00:10:59,810
but no central league about
Cuba but standing Cuba, uh,

161
00:10:59,910 --> 00:11:04,830
but in many ways they represent two
different sides of the spectrum, um,

162
00:11:04,920 --> 00:11:08,160
to have and have not,
um,

163
00:11:08,220 --> 00:11:13,220
is as we can see from the
Tido is a divided canvas is
populated by two taxonomic

164
00:11:15,031 --> 00:11:19,140
groups. Um, so it's very
much about classify ability.

165
00:11:19,230 --> 00:11:22,770
Not only is it giving
us two taxonomic groups,

166
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:27,560
but it's also about the phenomenon
of classify ability. Um,

167
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:29,790
are human beings classify,

168
00:11:29,820 --> 00:11:32,940
can they be put under
various generic labels?

169
00:11:32,941 --> 00:11:37,560
That is a big question in
his novel to the old man.

170
00:11:37,561 --> 00:11:42,000
And the sea is in many ways on
the other side of the spectrum,

171
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:43,880
as we can see as you,

172
00:11:43,980 --> 00:11:47,550
as you guys know the story,

173
00:11:47,580 --> 00:11:51,330
the novel is about a solitary,
um,

174
00:11:52,100 --> 00:11:55,700
fishermen, Cuban fishermen
in San Diego. Um,

175
00:11:55,780 --> 00:11:58,960
and his decision to go out along,
um,

176
00:11:59,020 --> 00:12:03,400
and he did get this huge Marlin
once again, that fish, um,

177
00:12:03,490 --> 00:12:08,350
and he's trying to save that, uh,
from being eaten up by sharks.

178
00:12:08,620 --> 00:12:13,550
So the novel was really about his struggle
against the sharks and he loses out

179
00:12:13,551 --> 00:12:17,830
of the mountain is completely cleaned out
by the sharks by the end of the novel.

180
00:12:18,180 --> 00:12:19,840
Uh,
but in spite of that ending,

181
00:12:19,860 --> 00:12:24,860
it is really about the heroic struggle
of man against elemental forces.

182
00:12:25,390 --> 00:12:29,650
So, um, most of us know Hemingway
actually as the Hemingway,

183
00:12:29,830 --> 00:12:32,870
the old man and the sea, and it's, um,

184
00:12:33,250 --> 00:12:34,870
helpful to keep that in mind.

185
00:12:35,110 --> 00:12:40,110
But Hemingway is also very interested
in the other side of the equation,

186
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:44,290
which is about, um, not
so much about individuals,

187
00:12:44,291 --> 00:12:49,291
as about individuals who can be
understood or can be encompass,

188
00:12:50,050 --> 00:12:55,000
accounted for in terms
of social types. So, um,

189
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:59,770
we see it not only in the
main characters in the novel,

190
00:12:59,980 --> 00:13:04,360
but also in very marginal characters.
People who would appear just once.

191
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:09,670
Um, they also presented to us as social
types. So the very opening of the novel,

192
00:13:09,940 --> 00:13:10,720
um,

193
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:15,720
Harry Morgan is approached by his three
young Cubans who want to pay him a lot

194
00:13:17,021 --> 00:13:21,460
of money to be taken to the United States.
Um, and this is how they are described.

195
00:13:22,630 --> 00:13:26,530
They were good looking young
fellows work good clothes,

196
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:31,450
none of them wore hats and they
look like they had plenty of money.

197
00:13:32,140 --> 00:13:35,170
They talk friendly with money anyway.

198
00:13:35,890 --> 00:13:40,890
And there's the kind of English
Cubans with money speed,

199
00:13:41,170 --> 00:13:41,411
right.

200
00:13:41,411 --> 00:13:46,411
So obviously classify as well it's
fun standard and this passage,

201
00:13:46,770 --> 00:13:47,050
um,

202
00:13:47,050 --> 00:13:51,730
the various syntax they talked plenty of
money is an expression that we use and

203
00:13:51,731 --> 00:13:56,200
is certainly, it's the kind of labeling
that goes on behind that kind of syntax.

204
00:13:56,650 --> 00:13:59,800
Um, so the uh, where the
parent is the clothes,

205
00:13:59,801 --> 00:14:04,801
the speech patterns of these
people easily classify them.

206
00:14:06,220 --> 00:14:09,690
We don't really need to know much else
about them that they haven't weighed,

207
00:14:09,700 --> 00:14:12,760
is not interested in telling
as much else about them.

208
00:14:12,940 --> 00:14:17,860
They are just there as representatives
of Cubans with money who need to get out

209
00:14:17,861 --> 00:14:20,950
of Cuba at that moment.
Um,

210
00:14:21,340 --> 00:14:25,750
but because classifiable it
seems so central to the novel.

211
00:14:26,020 --> 00:14:26,560
The question,

212
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:31,560
obviously it arises as to whether or not
Harry Morgan himself as classifiable,

213
00:14:34,060 --> 00:14:35,320
he is a hero.

214
00:14:35,321 --> 00:14:40,321
He's a protagonist who inhabits a novel
that is populated by loss of social

215
00:14:41,501 --> 00:14:44,900
types, right? Whether or not
he belongs with Nahu fist,

216
00:14:44,960 --> 00:14:49,490
completely into that landscape
is to open question. Um,

217
00:14:49,570 --> 00:14:51,230
is he evil,
uh,

218
00:14:51,410 --> 00:14:55,040
to break away okayso finally
from that landscape does,

219
00:14:55,041 --> 00:15:00,041
he's managed to stand out
and be an individual that
we would recognize and that

220
00:15:02,091 --> 00:15:07,091
will stick in our memories as one
individual rather than as one social type.

221
00:15:08,001 --> 00:15:13,001
That is the question that we have to think
about and I like to break that down a

222
00:15:13,761 --> 00:15:16,970
little bit. Um, in terms of for, uh,

223
00:15:17,060 --> 00:15:21,470
interconnected clusters
of issues, one is, um,

224
00:15:21,500 --> 00:15:23,300
to willy stands,
Harry Morgan,

225
00:15:23,690 --> 00:15:27,920
a racist is he races or not races?
Um,

226
00:15:27,950 --> 00:15:32,690
the other question and that's something
that we've already seen in thought the

227
00:15:32,691 --> 00:15:34,400
play approved now,
um,

228
00:15:34,460 --> 00:15:39,460
and that is highlighted
dramatize by Hemingway's joys
and narrative technique is

229
00:15:40,191 --> 00:15:45,191
whether he is an eye or whether he is
a he and the choice of those pronouns.

230
00:15:49,940 --> 00:15:53,940
Obviously it has narrative
implications, right? If he is an iron,

231
00:15:53,950 --> 00:15:58,950
very likely we're going to see the inside
of him is going to be an interior view

232
00:15:59,870 --> 00:16:02,480
of Harriet.
If he's going to be a here,

233
00:16:02,540 --> 00:16:06,570
very likely there's going to be
an external view of Paris. Um,

234
00:16:06,680 --> 00:16:11,680
just as in [inaudible] there's an external
view and not very pretty view of doc

235
00:16:12,700 --> 00:16:15,560
in the false section of
the sound, the theory. Um,

236
00:16:15,610 --> 00:16:20,350
and finally going back to the title of
the course of the, of the novel, uh,

237
00:16:20,420 --> 00:16:23,120
whether he is a half or have not,

238
00:16:23,330 --> 00:16:26,610
does he accept the novel empty handed?
Um,

239
00:16:26,750 --> 00:16:30,300
can you say that he has
achieved something? Um,

240
00:16:30,350 --> 00:16:33,710
there's something is in his
possession that he has on there.

241
00:16:34,100 --> 00:16:38,650
He owns something with he also
both in the beginning, uh,

242
00:16:38,870 --> 00:16:43,260
whether he's still almost anything at
all at the annals of novel. That is no,

243
00:16:43,261 --> 00:16:45,230
the question,
um,

244
00:16:45,620 --> 00:16:50,620
I raised the question of racism because
that is the question raised by Toni

245
00:16:52,670 --> 00:16:54,620
Morrison.
Toni Morrison,

246
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:59,800
we know as the author of novels
[inaudible] live in aisles like beloved.

247
00:17:01,760 --> 00:17:06,350
Um, but she's also, um, uh, someone who,

248
00:17:06,440 --> 00:17:07,130
um,

249
00:17:07,130 --> 00:17:11,990
gives a lot of talks and she also
turned some of those tasks into essays.

250
00:17:11,991 --> 00:17:16,991
So play in the dark is the collection
of essays published by Tony Morrison.

251
00:17:17,780 --> 00:17:22,520
And she devoted the long section
to Hemingway and to have,

252
00:17:22,570 --> 00:17:23,690
to have and have not,

253
00:17:23,970 --> 00:17:27,530
it's very interesting that this is not
the best known novel I haven't went,

254
00:17:27,531 --> 00:17:32,380
but this is the novel that,
um, Morrison singles out. Um,

255
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:36,230
or those just singling it
out, not to praise it. Uh,

256
00:17:36,250 --> 00:17:40,880
I've had to pull into some troubling
aspects of to have and have not,

257
00:17:41,460 --> 00:17:43,640
um,
and this is what Morrison says.

258
00:17:44,570 --> 00:17:48,290
Harry includes a nigger and his crew,

259
00:17:48,840 --> 00:17:52,890
a a man who threw out all of that.
One has known name,

260
00:17:53,910 --> 00:17:56,700
his appearance is taken
on by the sentence.

261
00:17:57,180 --> 00:18:00,840
Just then the nigger we had
getting paid comes down to dark.

262
00:18:01,710 --> 00:18:05,370
The black man is not only
nameless for five chapters,

263
00:18:05,700 --> 00:18:07,170
he's not even hired.

264
00:18:07,650 --> 00:18:12,210
Just someone we had getting
beat the kind of trend with.

265
00:18:12,790 --> 00:18:17,790
Now that Asian assessing the job and
then she goes on to say the spatial and

266
00:18:19,501 --> 00:18:24,501
conceptual difference is marked by the
shortcut that the term nigger allows with

267
00:18:27,090 --> 00:18:30,510
all this color and cast implications.

268
00:18:31,230 --> 00:18:36,230
The term occupies a territory
between man and animal for free.

269
00:18:37,800 --> 00:18:42,570
Um, strong objections to the novel. Um,

270
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:46,950
in response, I'll just, not to
defend him in way completely,

271
00:18:47,630 --> 00:18:51,030
but just to point out that the one that
goes up use my Faulkner's we've just

272
00:18:51,031 --> 00:18:52,230
seen,
um,

273
00:18:52,290 --> 00:18:56,740
is also used by Marc train because that's
the word that those characters were

274
00:18:56,741 --> 00:19:01,050
the views how Finn with have used
the neighbor in the 19th century.

275
00:19:01,080 --> 00:19:04,530
It would have been very odd for Mark
Twain not to use that work in this novel.

276
00:19:05,040 --> 00:19:06,810
Um,
someone like Quentin,

277
00:19:06,870 --> 00:19:11,870
suddenly Jason would have used the
word nigger if they were living people.

278
00:19:12,930 --> 00:19:17,670
So it would have been very odd for farming
not to use that work because that's

279
00:19:17,910 --> 00:19:21,000
the basic speech pattern
of his characters. Um,

280
00:19:21,150 --> 00:19:24,750
but quite aside from that,
um,

281
00:19:24,900 --> 00:19:28,290
but as you also point out
that, um, Maura's and Ashley,

282
00:19:28,291 --> 00:19:33,240
you can see it's that it's only
in part one that this black man,

283
00:19:33,570 --> 00:19:37,020
um, doesn't have a name. He actually,
he does over there in part two.

284
00:19:37,021 --> 00:19:41,160
So we can look at that
moment of transition when the
black men acquires and name

285
00:19:41,161 --> 00:19:46,110
off son, find out what his car. Um,
but uh, before we get into part two,

286
00:19:46,140 --> 00:19:51,140
I just want to actually look at
another one to call attention to,

287
00:19:51,630 --> 00:19:55,380
um,
a passage where the word nigger is used.

288
00:19:55,680 --> 00:20:00,240
But now to describe the black
men that Morrison has in mind.

289
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:04,520
This is an earlier appearance
of that word nigger. Um,

290
00:20:04,590 --> 00:20:07,860
and this is actually coming right after,
um,

291
00:20:08,100 --> 00:20:12,750
Harry's conversation with
those three, uh, rich Cubans.

292
00:20:13,080 --> 00:20:16,800
Um, all of a sudden this,
this seat is fighting,

293
00:20:16,830 --> 00:20:19,650
breaking out and shooting.
Um,

294
00:20:19,740 --> 00:20:24,740
and it turns out that the key player
in that shooting as a black character,

295
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:31,400
the nigger with a Tommy gun goddess
phase almost into the street and gave the

296
00:20:33,091 --> 00:20:37,770
back of the wagon of births from
underneath. And sure enough,

297
00:20:37,830 --> 00:20:38,850
one came down,

298
00:20:39,110 --> 00:20:44,110
fall into what the sidewalk with his
head above the curb attended feet.

299
00:20:44,730 --> 00:20:49,030
The leaker charlatan in the
belly with a Tommy Gun with one.

300
00:20:49,100 --> 00:20:53,170
Must've been the last shot in it
because I saw him throw it down.

301
00:20:53,650 --> 00:20:57,510
No Pancho set down hard
and went over four with,

302
00:20:58,210 --> 00:21:01,450
he was trying to come up,
still holding onto the Luger,

303
00:21:01,870 --> 00:21:06,550
only he couldn't get his head up when
a nigger and took the shotgun that was

304
00:21:06,551 --> 00:21:11,530
lying again as the wheel of the car by
the show for and to do the side of his

305
00:21:11,531 --> 00:21:15,420
head, some nigger. Okay.

306
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:20,890
So we might object to file
and of this theme. Uh,

307
00:21:20,920 --> 00:21:25,920
but what is clear in this passage is the
tremendous admiration that having wet

308
00:21:28,780 --> 00:21:33,780
has for this black character he's been
meant to kill to his job is to kill the

309
00:21:35,501 --> 00:21:37,620
three rich Cubans.
Um,

310
00:21:37,750 --> 00:21:42,220
and he accomplishes that
task magnificently. Um,

311
00:21:42,250 --> 00:21:43,120
so this is,

312
00:21:43,140 --> 00:21:48,140
and having way is just using every bit
of his writerly skill to convey to us,

313
00:21:52,541 --> 00:21:57,541
even those of us who really know nothing
about guns and nothing about the odd of

314
00:21:57,671 --> 00:22:00,880
shooting.
To highlight for us,

315
00:22:00,910 --> 00:22:05,080
one an odd there's there is to be able
to get your face almost down to the

316
00:22:05,081 --> 00:22:08,050
street until he will to get someone,
um,

317
00:22:08,110 --> 00:22:12,340
to get the shotgun when there's no more,
nothing left in your own.

318
00:22:12,350 --> 00:22:16,810
Tommi Gunn. And to be able to finish
off the last of the three Cubans,

319
00:22:17,020 --> 00:22:21,190
one against three, um, you know,
just the performance of it.

320
00:22:21,670 --> 00:22:22,240
Um,

321
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:27,240
so this nothing but admiration in this
description of the black man and we can

322
00:22:30,250 --> 00:22:35,250
almost get a kind of a capsule summary
of the intense admiration from the two

323
00:22:36,100 --> 00:22:40,870
word phrase that concludes the
passage. Some nigger, okay.

324
00:22:41,140 --> 00:22:44,050
How many ways,
still using the word nigger,

325
00:22:44,470 --> 00:22:49,470
but the expression Stum Negro almost
completely undermines that word.

326
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:53,890
Yes,
he's a nigger.

327
00:22:54,370 --> 00:22:57,010
His the classifiable type,

328
00:22:57,700 --> 00:23:00,750
but he's Nivison specimen.

329
00:23:00,790 --> 00:23:04,120
He's an amazing specimen of that type.

330
00:23:04,540 --> 00:23:08,530
So much so that his stretching
that type two is limit.

331
00:23:08,531 --> 00:23:12,600
So much so that he's almost making
that type non anthology. No,

332
00:23:12,610 --> 00:23:16,860
he's such an amazing character
that is almost, you know,

333
00:23:16,861 --> 00:23:20,110
you can call him a nigger, but it doesn't
really mean anything, was some nigger.

334
00:23:20,550 --> 00:23:24,640
Um,
it turns out that some that construction,

335
00:23:24,641 --> 00:23:28,180
some followed by what appears
to be a derogatory term,

336
00:23:28,570 --> 00:23:32,640
that is a kind of a verbal
tick for Harry Morgan.

337
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:36,520
He uses that phrase over and over
again for other characters as well.

338
00:23:36,521 --> 00:23:41,521
So we can go and look at some other
instances when he uses that construction.

339
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:42,790
Um,

340
00:23:42,790 --> 00:23:47,790
and it turns out that he also
uses it for the man who has a,

341
00:23:48,170 --> 00:23:53,060
who owes him $825. And they said it
was a clear out without paying a cent.

342
00:23:53,090 --> 00:23:57,980
This is the very regionals to Johnson who
charters the boat for fishing managers

343
00:23:57,981 --> 00:24:02,480
to lose the whole, um, other, um, um, the,

344
00:24:02,630 --> 00:24:06,850
the, um, the works under on boat, um,

345
00:24:06,930 --> 00:24:10,520
managers to, to, um, uh,

346
00:24:10,850 --> 00:24:13,980
to do real damage, uh, to, to, to,

347
00:24:14,040 --> 00:24:17,750
to Harry's bill because of his
enamel as efficient and um,

348
00:24:17,840 --> 00:24:20,780
and so he owes $825.

349
00:24:21,500 --> 00:24:26,310
And this Mr. Johnson,
even though he is quite in as a fisherman,

350
00:24:26,570 --> 00:24:30,440
he nonetheless is very
skilled in one thing.

351
00:24:30,470 --> 00:24:35,420
And this is why this passage pays
tribute to he went on the plane,

352
00:24:35,450 --> 00:24:39,440
frankly, he frankly said,
all right, there was,

353
00:24:39,890 --> 00:24:44,180
the counselor was close as
well, the science. And anyhow,

354
00:24:44,420 --> 00:24:46,760
Wayne was in Miami by now.

355
00:24:47,420 --> 00:24:51,650
I couldn't even send a wire
some Mr. Johnson, right.

356
00:24:52,190 --> 00:24:53,210
It was my fault.

357
00:24:53,690 --> 00:24:58,280
I should have known better how I didn't
even have enough money to put in gas.

358
00:24:58,310 --> 00:25:02,000
It was a hell of a note.
All right, so Mr. Johnson,

359
00:25:02,600 --> 00:25:06,740
it is not the same kind of
performance as the shooting,

360
00:25:08,300 --> 00:25:13,300
but it guests from Harry the
same involuntary and the regime,

361
00:25:15,350 --> 00:25:20,350
even though he's obviously the victim
of that magnificent performance on the

362
00:25:21,291 --> 00:25:24,440
poem, Mr. Johnson, it takes nerve,

363
00:25:24,441 --> 00:25:29,441
it takes whatever ruthlessness we can
attach any number of adjectives to Mr.

364
00:25:33,860 --> 00:25:35,190
Johnson anyway,

365
00:25:35,420 --> 00:25:40,420
and it's much more economic style
of writing uses only one phrase.

366
00:25:41,990 --> 00:25:45,090
And that is enough desk completely
adequate for Mr. Johnson.

367
00:25:45,110 --> 00:25:49,790
There's no need for any string of
adjectives to be attached to Mr. Johnson,

368
00:25:50,060 --> 00:25:53,270
some Mr [inaudible] that does it all.
Um,

369
00:25:53,330 --> 00:25:58,330
so we can see right away that this is
really Hemingway's way of both paying

370
00:26:00,690 --> 00:26:04,380
tribute to a generic type. In this
case, we'll Richman, you know,

371
00:26:04,610 --> 00:26:07,740
even his name is generic. Mr. Johnson. Um,

372
00:26:07,760 --> 00:26:12,260
here's a generic type is a
generic Richman who managers,

373
00:26:12,530 --> 00:26:15,190
um, you know, to, uh,

374
00:26:15,470 --> 00:26:19,850
get to be where he is by what he
does by doing so numbers of things.

375
00:26:20,300 --> 00:26:23,510
And he's very, very good
at that. Uh, so once again,

376
00:26:23,540 --> 00:26:27,140
this is a generic type of
specimen of a generic type.

377
00:26:27,500 --> 00:26:31,820
Those so good at what he's doing
that he's stretches the limit,

378
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:36,470
that type
one a example.

379
00:26:36,471 --> 00:26:41,090
And this one is much more analogous
to the expression, some nigger.

380
00:26:41,180 --> 00:26:45,540
Um, we know that, um, actually
even in Cuba, there's a very,

381
00:26:45,970 --> 00:26:50,440
uh, significant, even in Havana
now there's a very important, uh,

382
00:26:50,490 --> 00:26:54,830
Chinese population and it to tell that
there is a timeless character into have

383
00:26:54,840 --> 00:26:59,790
and have not. Um, he's very
smooth. Talkings looking, uh,

384
00:26:59,820 --> 00:27:01,350
China man.
Um,

385
00:27:01,500 --> 00:27:06,500
he wears a white suit and the silk shirt
with a black tie and a $125 Panama hat.

386
00:27:08,760 --> 00:27:11,310
So he also talks like this.
Um,

387
00:27:11,400 --> 00:27:15,280
and Hemingway gives us a
specimen of the spiritual,

388
00:27:15,300 --> 00:27:17,840
have them have this
very classified or type,

389
00:27:18,690 --> 00:27:22,040
he talks like an Englishman quite.
So it's the things that,

390
00:27:22,290 --> 00:27:26,370
how many you might have fortunate
compared with. Could you both accommodate?

391
00:27:26,840 --> 00:27:30,360
You Mean Carrie?
You stood up and I watch him go out.

392
00:27:30,570 --> 00:27:32,820
Frankly smiled at him. I, he,

393
00:27:32,821 --> 00:27:35,730
when Mr Sam doesn't look at him,

394
00:27:36,090 --> 00:27:40,990
he was a smooth looking
chink. Alright. Some Chin.

395
00:27:42,420 --> 00:27:45,390
Okay. So once again, um,

396
00:27:45,510 --> 00:27:49,930
there's a type that outperforms the
tape by the way of margin, right?

397
00:27:49,980 --> 00:27:54,980
So this is about what kind of performance
can be expected within a generic title

398
00:27:57,540 --> 00:28:00,510
and the extent of that outperformance,

399
00:28:00,570 --> 00:28:05,460
even as a smooth talking
Ching Mr Sing is very,

400
00:28:05,461 --> 00:28:10,380
very memorable. Um, and we see it.

401
00:28:10,530 --> 00:28:11,250
Um,

402
00:28:11,250 --> 00:28:16,250
and even when Mr Sing is that he's still
memorable and still more than just a

403
00:28:17,651 --> 00:28:21,830
specimen, you guys
probably know, um, that um,

404
00:28:21,900 --> 00:28:26,310
Mr Sing is killed by Harry.
Um, because he was Harry,

405
00:28:26,370 --> 00:28:31,020
he was basically the kill off
12 channels, passengers, uh,

406
00:28:31,170 --> 00:28:35,460
that he has no intention of shipping to
where they thought they were going. Um,

407
00:28:35,461 --> 00:28:40,420
so he was Harry to kill those 12 times
passengers and instead of killing those

408
00:28:40,421 --> 00:28:43,780
swells, Chinese passengers,
herring kills Mr. Sing,

409
00:28:44,130 --> 00:28:47,640
but not without a lot of resistance,

410
00:28:47,700 --> 00:28:50,790
a very heroic resistance,
uh,

411
00:28:51,030 --> 00:28:55,440
never seen resistance from Mr
Singh. And this is the outcome. Uh,

412
00:28:55,540 --> 00:28:58,820
his dad is killed by Harry,
uh,

413
00:28:58,860 --> 00:29:01,650
but he's left a mark on herring.
Um,

414
00:29:01,680 --> 00:29:06,390
and this is actually the beginning
of the bodily injuries sustained by,

415
00:29:07,040 --> 00:29:07,530
um,

416
00:29:07,530 --> 00:29:12,530
this is actually one of the structural
principles and the novel is the things

417
00:29:14,881 --> 00:29:18,450
that eat into Harry's body.

418
00:29:18,510 --> 00:29:23,010
And that is pilot with a
catalog of things that,

419
00:29:23,160 --> 00:29:28,160
that we can put on the half not calling
Harry's stars with these of able body

420
00:29:30,451 --> 00:29:33,750
person who is completely his eyes by the,
um,

421
00:29:34,100 --> 00:29:38,820
and he gradually loses some
positive as his body positive.

422
00:29:38,850 --> 00:29:40,410
There's barley,
we get them.

423
00:29:40,411 --> 00:29:45,411
And so is the first instance of something
that happens to his body and is coming

424
00:29:46,740 --> 00:29:48,150
to him because Mr Saint,

425
00:29:49,540 --> 00:29:54,540
I held a wheel with my knee and opened
up my should and saw where Mr Sing did

426
00:29:57,490 --> 00:29:58,323
me.

427
00:29:58,890 --> 00:30:02,710
It was quite a bite and put iodine on it.

428
00:30:03,630 --> 00:30:08,630
And then I sat there staring and wondering
whether the bite from retirement was

429
00:30:08,800 --> 00:30:13,520
supposedly as hell know that bite
wasn't poisonous. A man like that.

430
00:30:13,521 --> 00:30:17,380
And it's the same Polly's from his
teeth two or three times a day.

431
00:30:18,090 --> 00:30:23,090
Some of this to say this is
Hemingway writing and not father,

432
00:30:23,740 --> 00:30:28,740
but we see this thing mixture of cash
and even comedy right here in food as

433
00:30:29,950 --> 00:30:34,750
Flint. So it is not a great
experience to be bitten by anyone.

434
00:30:34,751 --> 00:30:37,870
And this seems to be a very bad,
but um,

435
00:30:37,900 --> 00:30:42,400
but the is also an
occasion on what a generic,

436
00:30:42,550 --> 00:30:45,690
smooth looking chink with deal.
Um,

437
00:30:45,880 --> 00:30:48,640
he's going to be brushing his
teeth three or four times,

438
00:30:48,641 --> 00:30:53,641
then you can count on his hygiene to
save you from getting any infection from

439
00:30:53,681 --> 00:30:57,040
his bike. So this one consoling fat. Um,

440
00:30:57,100 --> 00:31:01,540
but he's at least if you have to be busy
in his belly to be bitten by the lights

441
00:31:01,541 --> 00:31:06,190
and this saying than to be by someone
else. Um, that is the dark comedy,

442
00:31:06,280 --> 00:31:11,140
um, that, um, is emerging
and to have and have not. Um,

443
00:31:11,170 --> 00:31:16,090
but it also is a meditation,
um,

444
00:31:16,180 --> 00:31:20,260
really on all those derogatory labels.
Um,

445
00:31:20,410 --> 00:31:22,990
and the question to us,
uh,

446
00:31:23,260 --> 00:31:28,000
as to whether or not we should consider
them aloud or whether or not we should

447
00:31:28,001 --> 00:31:33,001
say this is an instance where
it is completely legitimate
to use those words or

448
00:31:33,461 --> 00:31:37,060
whether we still think that some
other work would have been preferred.

449
00:31:37,360 --> 00:31:41,830
So I encourage you to talk
about this issue in section. Um,

450
00:31:42,370 --> 00:31:44,260
but now,
um,

451
00:31:45,280 --> 00:31:50,200
I like to switch to part two of two,
half and half,

452
00:31:50,201 --> 00:31:51,610
not um,

453
00:31:51,700 --> 00:31:56,440
and to the possibility
that Harry Morgan himself,

454
00:31:56,860 --> 00:32:01,410
my actually they portrayed as a Tyler,
uh,

455
00:32:01,720 --> 00:32:06,460
as dramatize, uh, and
reinforced by having ways,

456
00:32:06,490 --> 00:32:07,570
narrative technique.

457
00:32:07,930 --> 00:32:12,930
So we're switching to third
person narration and a very
jolting outside view of

458
00:32:15,010 --> 00:32:15,843
herring Morgan.

459
00:32:16,600 --> 00:32:21,100
And this is also the moment when the
black character and actually acquires a

460
00:32:21,101 --> 00:32:24,100
name and sorry,
Wesley,

461
00:32:24,190 --> 00:32:28,900
the man's led by God to steer
you. Treat a man, know about her.

462
00:32:28,901 --> 00:32:32,800
The dog to Negro said
it was getting ugly now,

463
00:32:33,610 --> 00:32:38,610
but the man was still sorry for him. I'm
going to make you comfortable, Wesley.

464
00:32:38,670 --> 00:32:43,100
He said, you just lay quiet.
You ain't going to things me up.

465
00:32:43,101 --> 00:32:47,630
The neighbors had the man
whose name was Harry Morgan,

466
00:32:48,290 --> 00:32:53,120
said nothing then because he liked the
nigger and there was nothing to do.

467
00:32:53,120 --> 00:32:56,180
Now I hit him that he couldn't hit him.

468
00:32:57,650 --> 00:32:59,500
Um,
it is um,

469
00:32:59,870 --> 00:33:04,870
very almost things to add to deliberate
hostility against his own character.

470
00:33:05,810 --> 00:33:06,530
Um,

471
00:33:06,530 --> 00:33:11,530
after so many pages when we're inside
the head and inside the skin of Harry

472
00:33:12,350 --> 00:33:14,810
Morgan two and counter that phrase,

473
00:33:15,560 --> 00:33:17,790
the man whose name was Harry mortgage,

474
00:33:18,380 --> 00:33:23,380
it can be more externalizing and that
can be more objectifying than that.

475
00:33:25,430 --> 00:33:30,430
What is interesting is that
that objectified discretion
is actually use for a

476
00:33:33,621 --> 00:33:38,621
white protagonist in the same moment
when the black character is acquiring a

477
00:33:40,341 --> 00:33:44,900
name like so this kind of double
dynamics suggest that this is a very,

478
00:33:44,901 --> 00:33:46,430
very important moment.

479
00:33:46,940 --> 00:33:51,940
New Black character acquires and them
and the white character also acquires a

480
00:33:53,751 --> 00:33:58,070
name but in a bad way he had,
if when he had been telling the story,

481
00:33:58,790 --> 00:34:03,590
he doesn't refer to himself as Harry
Morgan for the white character to acquire

482
00:34:03,620 --> 00:34:08,150
the name and to be referred to as
the man whose name was Harry Morgan.

483
00:34:08,750 --> 00:34:13,750
Cause him in almost exactly the same
structural position as the black man

484
00:34:14,340 --> 00:34:15,110
Westlake.

485
00:34:15,110 --> 00:34:19,490
Each of them requires a name except the
full of black heritage row to apply and

486
00:34:19,491 --> 00:34:20,480
then is a good thing.

487
00:34:20,660 --> 00:34:25,280
Whereas for the white
character [inaudible] name is
about the worst thing that

488
00:34:25,281 --> 00:34:28,040
can happen to him at that moment.
Um,

489
00:34:28,250 --> 00:34:33,250
why is it that Hemingway was
suddenly switch to this third person?

490
00:34:33,441 --> 00:34:38,180
They're Asian and it's very alienating
mechanism that has been visited upon

491
00:34:38,450 --> 00:34:42,180
Harry Morgan. Um, we can think
of a number of issues. Um,

492
00:34:42,320 --> 00:34:46,970
in section,
in part one we sort of know,

493
00:34:47,620 --> 00:34:51,700
uh, Harry does for a living, right? You
know, we sort of have our, you know,

494
00:34:51,710 --> 00:34:55,610
why does this man have a boat? Uh,
we sort of have our conjectures,

495
00:34:56,300 --> 00:35:01,300
but insect in plug to all of
that is being clarified for us.

496
00:35:01,720 --> 00:35:06,610
Um, we know that the, the
black man is his shot. Um,

497
00:35:06,740 --> 00:35:10,310
and um, there's the smell
of the maker of the boat.

498
00:35:11,510 --> 00:35:16,510
The boat itself is referred
to as the booze boat.

499
00:35:17,120 --> 00:35:20,900
So we know that's what Harry
does in his day smugglers.

500
00:35:21,540 --> 00:35:24,720
They are into the United States.
Um,

501
00:35:24,950 --> 00:35:29,690
he becomes just that, you know,
that's his profession. Um,

502
00:35:29,900 --> 00:35:32,680
and that's what we know him by.
Um,

503
00:35:32,720 --> 00:35:37,720
that takes over to intimate into hurdle
view that we had of him in part one.

504
00:35:39,590 --> 00:35:44,590
And because that is their occupation
that lands him in this type,

505
00:35:46,620 --> 00:35:50,880
in this very tight spot
with his companion. The
black man was maybe in shot.

506
00:35:50,881 --> 00:35:54,270
And we also know that
something else happens as well,

507
00:35:54,271 --> 00:35:58,020
that that Wesley is not the only one,
um,

508
00:35:58,110 --> 00:36:00,960
to be shot on that occasion.
Um,

509
00:36:01,320 --> 00:36:06,270
as we find out in this
man's, uh, disruption.

510
00:36:07,920 --> 00:36:10,320
Who the hell Sean was,
he asked him,

511
00:36:11,160 --> 00:36:15,660
you only you sharp.
Worse than legal side,

512
00:36:16,770 --> 00:36:20,070
but he never been sharp. I didn't
figure it out. You get shot.

513
00:36:20,490 --> 00:36:23,420
I am paid to get shot.
I don't want to be a shot.

514
00:36:24,180 --> 00:36:26,640
[inaudible] Wesley,
the man told him.

515
00:36:27,120 --> 00:36:29,340
Don't do you any good to talk like that.

516
00:36:30,510 --> 00:36:34,830
I'm just this one little
detail that in fact,

517
00:36:35,010 --> 00:36:38,480
both of them were shot,
uh,

518
00:36:38,550 --> 00:36:43,290
because they obviously had run in
the booze world was discovered.

519
00:36:43,680 --> 00:36:48,240
Um,
and so it was a major event,

520
00:36:48,750 --> 00:36:51,160
um, with casualties, um,

521
00:36:51,300 --> 00:36:56,100
in both Harry and Westley.
So far,

522
00:36:56,130 --> 00:37:00,900
whether it's in the foreground,
in part two is the casualty is to,

523
00:37:00,910 --> 00:37:05,100
wouldn't sustain by Wesley. And that's
what he's complaining about. His making,

524
00:37:06,330 --> 00:37:09,000
everyone aware that he's been shot.

525
00:37:09,810 --> 00:37:14,810
The extent of Harris one is
revealed to us in this very oblique,

526
00:37:17,130 --> 00:37:22,130
very marginal mention who the hell
shot worse he asked you or meet you,

527
00:37:24,450 --> 00:37:25,290
your shoppers.

528
00:37:25,440 --> 00:37:30,440
So Wesley and knowledges that actually
the more serious one is on herring,

529
00:37:31,080 --> 00:37:36,080
but we don't actually know
what the consequences might
be because right now the

530
00:37:36,991 --> 00:37:39,570
limelight Israeli aren't Wesley.

531
00:37:39,810 --> 00:37:43,400
And the fact that his furious
for having gotten shot, uh,

532
00:37:43,490 --> 00:37:48,120
for going on this trip with Harry
and Harry trying his best to appears,

533
00:37:48,540 --> 00:37:53,040
um, due to a Westley. And then in the
rest of the [inaudible] two, we also have,

534
00:37:53,270 --> 00:37:55,470
um, this outside character, uh,

535
00:37:55,620 --> 00:37:58,670
federally Harrison who
takes up a louder space,

536
00:37:58,680 --> 00:38:03,320
impart to a one inch report,
Herrick to authorities. Um,

537
00:38:03,390 --> 00:38:07,280
so two is in many ways, um, uh,

538
00:38:07,410 --> 00:38:11,610
part of the story in which we see Harry,

539
00:38:12,090 --> 00:38:12,840
um,

540
00:38:12,840 --> 00:38:17,840
as someone who should be reported to
the authorities or someone who is the

541
00:38:18,811 --> 00:38:21,300
recipient of complaint from,

542
00:38:21,330 --> 00:38:26,220
of bill will of anger out of the glove
at the very leaders from Wesleyan. Um,

543
00:38:26,280 --> 00:38:31,170
and who's also someone that an outsider
would want to report to the authorities.

544
00:38:31,270 --> 00:38:35,890
Um, here's someone who's doing something
illegal. Um, and his, you know,

545
00:38:35,891 --> 00:38:38,560
he's outside the law anyways.
Um,

546
00:38:38,620 --> 00:38:43,620
so all that suggests that it
is fitting that in thought to,

547
00:38:44,470 --> 00:38:44,860
um,

548
00:38:44,860 --> 00:38:49,810
the storage to be tall from outside of
his point of view that we're no longer

549
00:38:49,811 --> 00:38:50,770
inside skin.

550
00:38:50,770 --> 00:38:55,770
We just see him as he is seen by other
people as he's seen by Wesley as he seen

551
00:38:56,591 --> 00:38:57,670
by Captain Willie,

552
00:38:57,900 --> 00:39:02,200
tries to protect him as he's seen
through the by nodular is, uh,

553
00:39:02,350 --> 00:39:06,790
by Federal Harrison who wants to report
him. Um, so he really is an object,

554
00:39:06,791 --> 00:39:08,940
isn't seen object.
Um,

555
00:39:09,010 --> 00:39:14,010
and it's fitting that this thin object
should be conveyed to us through the

556
00:39:14,411 --> 00:39:18,880
third person. Erasion and I think
that there's also another reason,

557
00:39:19,330 --> 00:39:19,990
um,

558
00:39:19,990 --> 00:39:24,990
why Hemingway w one two switch from
first person erasion too verbose in the

559
00:39:26,831 --> 00:39:30,850
Asian,
is that already in part two?

560
00:39:31,240 --> 00:39:36,240
We're beginning to see assymetry between
Harry and the black man as the rain.

561
00:39:37,891 --> 00:39:42,891
We just saw that both of them
acquire and name in part two.

562
00:39:44,380 --> 00:39:48,210
We now see in this moment
that they're also linked.

563
00:39:48,280 --> 00:39:52,960
They are kindred. In one sense,
they're kindred in a narrative sense.

564
00:39:53,200 --> 00:39:55,690
Um,
in the same way that Benji,

565
00:39:56,440 --> 00:39:59,390
Quentin and Jason are
kindred in narrative.

566
00:39:59,390 --> 00:40:04,390
Sam's as authors on these two are kindred
in a narrative sense because the same

567
00:40:06,220 --> 00:40:09,750
thing happen to them being shot.

568
00:40:10,420 --> 00:40:14,530
That is the time between those black
character in this way character.

569
00:40:14,980 --> 00:40:18,850
Um, and it, the only difference
between them, Ashley,

570
00:40:19,390 --> 00:40:22,930
is the degree of severity of that shot.

571
00:40:23,440 --> 00:40:26,000
And here as they, we know that, um,

572
00:40:26,100 --> 00:40:29,830
it is the black man who actually
has the later one that is the white

573
00:40:29,831 --> 00:40:34,780
protagonists who are suffering
the, the, the, the, the worst. Um,

574
00:40:35,030 --> 00:40:38,910
the suffering more actually
on this occasion. Um,

575
00:40:38,980 --> 00:40:43,980
so both the commonality between the
white character and the black heritage or

576
00:40:44,240 --> 00:40:47,190
we'll it or line and
differentiation in the standards.

577
00:40:47,230 --> 00:40:51,640
That is the person who has delay the
one who's been taken care of by Harry,

578
00:40:52,110 --> 00:40:56,590
um,
less than go to chapter nine,

579
00:40:56,591 --> 00:41:00,940
which is in pods free. Um, and here,

580
00:41:01,090 --> 00:41:04,750
um, it is, this is a chapter
that is taught by our,

581
00:41:04,751 --> 00:41:08,080
the very marginal character. Um, so, um,

582
00:41:08,110 --> 00:41:10,990
it is tour from um,
Albert's point of view,

583
00:41:11,290 --> 00:41:14,770
but Harry is once again
seen from the outside.

584
00:41:14,771 --> 00:41:18,580
He is a here in chapter nine
in blood three tap tonight.

585
00:41:19,210 --> 00:41:21,590
There was also interesting
about part three,

586
00:41:22,180 --> 00:41:24,270
chapter nine is that it bears,

587
00:41:24,280 --> 00:41:29,280
the curvy is a revisiting of earlier
moment between Harry and Wesley.

588
00:41:31,780 --> 00:41:36,780
And now we know the consequences
of that gunshot wound earlier.

589
00:41:39,500 --> 00:41:41,030
What happened to your arm?

590
00:41:41,960 --> 00:41:46,960
The lawyer as Harry Harry has to
sleeve and up to the shoulder.

591
00:41:48,140 --> 00:41:52,670
I didn't like the look of it,
so I cut it off. Harry told him,

592
00:41:53,390 --> 00:41:56,000
you and who else cut it off?

593
00:41:56,720 --> 00:41:58,730
Me and a doctor cut it off.

594
00:42:04,460 --> 00:42:09,460
I think that Hemingway really wants
that shock that comes from that lack of

595
00:42:11,930 --> 00:42:15,590
knowledge in section in thought to,

596
00:42:16,850 --> 00:42:21,850
well two goes onto quite awhile and all
the time when reading about Frederick

597
00:42:22,970 --> 00:42:23,440
Harrison,

598
00:42:23,440 --> 00:42:28,440
we have no idea that the one is serious
enough that the arm would have to be

599
00:42:28,641 --> 00:42:33,641
amputated and is the withholding of
that information and what to you that

600
00:42:37,040 --> 00:42:39,830
maximize and said in part three,

601
00:42:39,920 --> 00:42:44,920
it is a shock to us that that is what
will have to happen to Harry and none of

602
00:42:47,391 --> 00:42:48,320
them would have been,

603
00:42:48,720 --> 00:42:53,660
would have been conveyed to us if
Harry had been telling the story.

604
00:42:53,900 --> 00:42:57,770
It is impossible to talk about the
invitation of the loud with this kind of

605
00:42:58,100 --> 00:43:02,900
dramatic impersonality, um,
that Hemingway is ending for.

606
00:43:03,230 --> 00:43:07,940
If it had been told from Harris point of
view, it would have been about his pain.

607
00:43:07,941 --> 00:43:12,941
But Hemingway is not into
conveying to insight view of pain.

608
00:43:14,540 --> 00:43:19,430
That is not a phenomenal field
that he chooses to enter.

609
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:25,000
Some other novelists do great job within
that phenomena will feel pain that is

610
00:43:25,131 --> 00:43:27,680
not having waste chosen subjects.

611
00:43:27,950 --> 00:43:32,420
Where he was is to give us
that complete impersonal,

612
00:43:32,600 --> 00:43:35,210
neutral,
almost joking,

613
00:43:35,480 --> 00:43:39,620
kind of look at someone losing his arm.
Um,

614
00:43:39,680 --> 00:43:43,580
and that can only be achieved by
looking at Harry from the outside.

615
00:43:43,880 --> 00:43:48,880
So the combination of the straightforward
third person duration impala two and

616
00:43:50,961 --> 00:43:55,310
then Albert telling the
story in part three,

617
00:43:55,430 --> 00:43:56,263
chapter nine,

618
00:43:56,420 --> 00:44:01,420
the combination of those maximizes the
shock of realizing that really hairy is

619
00:44:03,781 --> 00:44:05,360
starting to do something.

620
00:44:05,361 --> 00:44:10,361
He's starting is well on his way and this
trajectory to us to have nod category

621
00:44:11,030 --> 00:44:14,820
his well on his way or losing
one's arm is, is, is, is um,

622
00:44:16,090 --> 00:44:20,420
is, is quite different from losing lots
of other things, uh, to say the least.

623
00:44:20,690 --> 00:44:21,800
So,
um,

624
00:44:22,220 --> 00:44:27,220
we've just seen that Harry has
something in common with Wesley,

625
00:44:27,950 --> 00:44:32,850
but we also see that he has something
ours in common with someone else as well

626
00:44:33,450 --> 00:44:38,450
because of course then when Ellis
pride it is had also lost his mom,

627
00:44:39,120 --> 00:44:44,120
Mr Sing in the fight between Harry
and his to say Harry tries to Ben,

628
00:44:44,940 --> 00:44:47,850
Mr Singh's arm behind him.
And at one point he just,

629
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:52,630
here's this funny low noise that is
made when an arm is broken. Um, and the,

630
00:44:52,631 --> 00:44:56,280
he lets go there mom, because um,
isn't good to Mr. Sing gang war.

631
00:44:56,610 --> 00:45:01,610
So we've seen that dramatize rendition
of someone losing his arm and this

632
00:45:02,820 --> 00:45:07,820
deliberately on dramatize rendition of
someone losing his arm and only appearing

633
00:45:09,030 --> 00:45:13,530
as a man without,
for Harry to appear as a man without a,

634
00:45:13,590 --> 00:45:17,850
and I'm in the eyes as seen
by the doctor but by a lawyer.

635
00:45:18,060 --> 00:45:23,060
So once again is Harry as a CNR object
but still the common ground is there.

636
00:45:24,270 --> 00:45:28,020
He and Mr saying Ashley, do
you have something in common?
Mr Saint loses his arm,

637
00:45:28,200 --> 00:45:32,600
he loses his life. Um, Harry
loses his arm with a knife,

638
00:45:32,601 --> 00:45:37,500
is going to lose this live like
Mr Sing is to open question,

639
00:45:37,920 --> 00:45:42,660
um, in to have and have no, so
this is a novel that Ashley,

640
00:45:42,900 --> 00:45:45,390
it is very hard to predict
the and they use novel.

641
00:45:45,390 --> 00:45:48,750
So I'm very happy not
to tell you the ending.

642
00:45:48,860 --> 00:45:53,150
I just leave it as an open question.
Um, to what extent is the cemetery, um,

643
00:45:53,820 --> 00:45:58,590
between Harry and Mr Saint go into
extended, how far does that example, um,

644
00:45:58,800 --> 00:46:00,660
but just one more,
um,

645
00:46:01,680 --> 00:46:06,680
meditation on the question
of having and not having,

646
00:46:08,130 --> 00:46:08,490
um,

647
00:46:08,490 --> 00:46:13,490
it seems that Harry actually is quite
aware that he is on his way to becoming a

648
00:46:14,911 --> 00:46:15,744
have not,

649
00:46:16,090 --> 00:46:21,030
but he has his own way
of classifying himself.

650
00:46:21,031 --> 00:46:22,620
So this is one characters,

651
00:46:23,030 --> 00:46:28,030
the term to classify himself in his own
fashion and what is going to be used as

652
00:46:29,891 --> 00:46:33,470
the criteria for classifying
the house and have no,

653
00:46:33,480 --> 00:46:37,620
you can classify people by the amount
of money they have or you can classify

654
00:46:37,890 --> 00:46:42,000
them by whether or not they have arms or
you can classify them by something else.

655
00:46:42,330 --> 00:46:47,310
So here is Harry proposing to
classify himself and his own fashion.

656
00:46:48,690 --> 00:46:52,050
The hell with my arm. You
lose an arm, you lose an arm.

657
00:46:52,590 --> 00:46:54,600
There's worse things than to lose an arm.

658
00:46:55,080 --> 00:46:59,000
You've got two arms and you've got
to have something else. And the,

659
00:46:59,250 --> 00:47:04,250
they were mad with one arm on one
of those to how with it he says,

660
00:47:05,130 --> 00:47:08,550
I don't want to talk about it.
Then after a minute he says,

661
00:47:09,120 --> 00:47:11,850
I got those other two still.

662
00:47:12,230 --> 00:47:17,230
So this is the celebrated concept
of the colonialist that um,

663
00:47:18,790 --> 00:47:20,830
that, that Harry, uh,

664
00:47:20,970 --> 00:47:25,320
still has the word that
having ways very fun of, um,

665
00:47:25,410 --> 00:47:29,710
and uh, that's how he would like
to pacify himself. You know,

666
00:47:29,980 --> 00:47:33,010
maybe the arm is the most
obvious thing that people see,

667
00:47:33,340 --> 00:47:38,340
but the most obvious thing is not actually
the thing that best classify someone.

668
00:47:39,450 --> 00:47:43,690
Um, something that is invisible,
um, could be a better classifier.

669
00:47:44,080 --> 00:47:45,010
So,
um,

670
00:47:45,070 --> 00:47:50,070
I think that the novel entertains that
question is how much can you lose?

671
00:47:50,440 --> 00:47:54,990
You know, the Harry is going to lose a
lot of things in the closet is novel. Um,

672
00:47:55,570 --> 00:48:00,490
you can keep on losing a lot of
things and still remain yourself.

673
00:48:00,550 --> 00:48:03,880
At least that's the hope. Or
maybe that's a fantasy. Um,

674
00:48:04,180 --> 00:48:06,750
we have to decide whether
it's a legitimate hole,

675
00:48:06,810 --> 00:48:08,920
a real or hope that actually is,

676
00:48:09,010 --> 00:48:13,380
has some grounding in reality or whether
it's just a fantasy, uh, weather.

677
00:48:14,140 --> 00:48:18,640
So important when you've lost so much
that you really have stopped being

678
00:48:18,641 --> 00:48:22,540
yourself, you're no longer what it used
to be. Whether that is indeed the case.

679
00:48:22,780 --> 00:48:27,610
So we'll come back, um, and
um, and ramp up the novel,

680
00:48:27,611 --> 00:48:31,090
but thing more about
where we should put Harry.
