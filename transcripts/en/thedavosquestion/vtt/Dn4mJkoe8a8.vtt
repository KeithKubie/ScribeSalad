00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.680
&gt;&gt; Copenhagen was not as successful as we
all would have expected.

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:12.190
But it was substantive progress.
And remember, it's the first time where we

00:00:12.190 --> 00:00:17.570
have commitments by the
United States, policy commitments by India

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:22.750
and by China.
Specific amendments by the EU in terms of

00:00:22.750 --> 00:00:30.359
targets, a renewed strength
and commitment by Japan, and by large emerging

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:34.860
countries in Latin
America like Brazil, Mexico -- both have made

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:38.270
their own independent
commitments in targeting.

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:43.510
So there is a lot of progress.
What happened in Copenhagen is we picked up

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:46.940
part of these -- of these
advances.

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:53.140
We now have to move to a more specific, more
targeted and also more

00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:56.240
binding type of agreement.
People expect it.

00:00:56.240 --> 00:01:00.190
I think we're going to be working towards
that in COP 16 in Mexico.

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:06.189
But also from here to COP 16, it's almost
a year that we have to take

00:01:06.189 --> 00:01:10.240
advantage of in order to deal both technicalities
as well as as the

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:15.450
matters of financing.
The whole deal can make or break in terms

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:20.979
of whether there is a viable
financing package there are ways in which

00:01:20.979 --> 00:01:26.049
one can put a viable
financing package together.

00:01:26.049 --> 00:01:29.579
There is the political will, there is the
awareness, and I think even

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:34.869
in the largest emerging economies, there is
not only the awareness, but

00:01:34.869 --> 00:01:38.370
there's also the conviction that they have
to do things for their own

00:01:38.370 --> 00:01:42.490
benefit as well as for the responsibility
they have vis a vie the rest

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:43.039
of the world.
