new in support library from 25.3 through

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:21.510
new in support library from 25.3 through
 

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:27.080

today's released 26 0 beta 1 so has

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:27.090
today's released 26 0 beta 1 so has
 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:29.419
today's released 26 0 beta 1 so has
anybody here not use the support library

00:00:29.419 --> 00:00:29.429
anybody here not use the support library
 

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:34.240
anybody here not use the support library
to develop an Android app Wow one person

00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:34.250
to develop an Android app Wow one person
 

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:38.020
to develop an Android app Wow one person
do you actually develop Android apps

00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:38.030
do you actually develop Android apps
 

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:40.100
do you actually develop Android apps
okay so everybody here is pretty

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:40.110
okay so everybody here is pretty
 

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:41.780
okay so everybody here is pretty
familiar with the support library it's a

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:41.790
familiar with the support library it's a
 

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:44.600
familiar with the support library it's a
collection of utilities and classes that

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:44.610
collection of utilities and classes that
 

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:47.119
collection of utilities and classes that
make it easy to target older versions of

00:00:47.119 --> 00:00:47.129
make it easy to target older versions of
 

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:49.520
make it easy to target older versions of
the platform use some new concepts like

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:49.530
the platform use some new concepts like
 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:50.090
the platform use some new concepts like
mature

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:50.100
mature
 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:52.939
mature
material design widgets and it's a very

00:00:52.939 --> 00:00:52.949
material design widgets and it's a very
 

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:54.470
material design widgets and it's a very
essential part of Android app

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:54.480
essential part of Android app
 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:58.459
essential part of Android app
development so we're going to start by

00:00:58.459 --> 00:00:58.469
development so we're going to start by
 

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:00.529
development so we're going to start by
talking about what's old in the android

00:01:00.529 --> 00:01:00.539
talking about what's old in the android
 

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:02.180
talking about what's old in the android
support library before we move on to

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:02.190
support library before we move on to
 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:06.410
support library before we move on to
what's new so last year you may recall

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:06.420
what's new so last year you may recall
 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:09.230
what's new so last year you may recall
that we drop support for SDKs lower than

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:09.240
that we drop support for SDKs lower than
 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:13.490
that we drop support for SDKs lower than
9 so donut declare and Froyo went away

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:13.500
9 so donut declare and Froyo went away
 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:15.770
9 so donut declare and Froyo went away
and this allowed us to focus more on the

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780
and this allowed us to focus more on the
 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:17.330
and this allowed us to focus more on the
API levels the developers are actually

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:17.340
API levels the developers are actually
 

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:20.149
API levels the developers are actually
targeting so a lot of compact code went

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:20.159
targeting so a lot of compact code went
 

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:22.039
targeting so a lot of compact code went
away and we reduced our method count by

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:22.049
away and we reduced our method count by
 

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:23.899
away and we reduced our method count by
quite a bit and when you're targeting

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:23.909
quite a bit and when you're targeting
 

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:26.990
quite a bit and when you're targeting
platforms earlier than 21 you're worried

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:27.000
platforms earlier than 21 you're worried
 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.660
platforms earlier than 21 you're worried
about the 65k Dex limit this is really

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:29.670
about the 65k Dex limit this is really
 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:34.249
about the 65k Dex limit this is really
helpful so today we have fewer than 1%

00:01:34.249 --> 00:01:34.259
helpful so today we have fewer than 1%
 

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:36.350
helpful so today we have fewer than 1%
of active Android devices according to

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:36.360
of active Android devices according to
 

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:38.990
of active Android devices according to
play store check-ins on api's lower than

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:39.000
play store check-ins on api's lower than
 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:43.550
play store check-ins on api's lower than
14 so you may guess what I'm about to

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:43.560
14 so you may guess what I'm about to
 

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:45.230
14 so you may guess what I'm about to
say is anybody still targeting

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:45.240
say is anybody still targeting
 

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:49.429
say is anybody still targeting
Gingerbread one or two people you

00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:49.439
Gingerbread one or two people you
 

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:50.960
Gingerbread one or two people you
probably have a sinking feeling right

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:50.970
probably have a sinking feeling right
 

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:54.560
probably have a sinking feeling right
now so as you might have guessed we are

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:54.570
now so as you might have guessed we are
 

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:56.990
now so as you might have guessed we are
removing support for API is lower than

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:57.000
removing support for API is lower than
 

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.530
removing support for API is lower than
14

00:01:59.530 --> 00:01:59.540
14
 

00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:03.550
14
and the support library team is as happy

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:03.560
and the support library team is as happy
 

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:05.710
and the support library team is as happy
about that as you are so we've got some

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:05.720
about that as you are so we've got some
 

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:07.840
about that as you are so we've got some
great benefits from this but the main

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:07.850
great benefits from this but the main
 

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:10.180
great benefits from this but the main
thing is that if you're min SDK is not

00:02:10.180 --> 00:02:10.190
thing is that if you're min SDK is not
 

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:15.430
thing is that if you're min SDK is not
already 14 it will become 14 if you're

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:15.440
already 14 it will become 14 if you're
 

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:17.080
already 14 it will become 14 if you're
still targeting in older versions the

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:17.090
still targeting in older versions the
 

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:18.760
still targeting in older versions the
three of you in this room that are still

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:18.770
three of you in this room that are still
 

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:21.070
three of you in this room that are still
targeting Gingerbread you can still use

00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:21.080
targeting Gingerbread you can still use
 

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:23.230
targeting Gingerbread you can still use
the existing versions of support library

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:23.240
the existing versions of support library
 

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:25.750
the existing versions of support library
so 25.3 is going to continue to work on

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:25.760
so 25.3 is going to continue to work on
 

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:28.300
so 25.3 is going to continue to work on
Gingerbread and honeycomb but if you

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:28.310
Gingerbread and honeycomb but if you
 

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:29.320
Gingerbread and honeycomb but if you
want to use some of the new features

00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:29.330
want to use some of the new features
 

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:31.270
want to use some of the new features
that we're talking about today you'll

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:31.280
that we're talking about today you'll
 

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:33.850
that we're talking about today you'll
need to maybe have a separate code

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:33.860
need to maybe have a separate code
 

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:38.220
need to maybe have a separate code
branch where your min SDK is 14

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:38.230
branch where your min SDK is 14
 

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:40.600
branch where your min SDK is 14
all right so some of the benefits that

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:40.610
all right so some of the benefits that
 

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:41.800
all right so some of the benefits that
you're going to get from this we've

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:41.810
you're going to get from this we've
 

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:45.940
you're going to get from this we've
dropped over 1,400 methods so we're a

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:45.950
dropped over 1,400 methods so we're a
 

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:48.040
dropped over 1,400 methods so we're a
little bit backing off from the Dex

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:48.050
little bit backing off from the Dex
 

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:52.090
little bit backing off from the Dex
limit and we're going to be removing

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:52.100
limit and we're going to be removing
 

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:54.880
limit and we're going to be removing
even more classes and methods so just

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:54.890
even more classes and methods so just
 

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:56.830
even more classes and methods so just
public methods and classes and

00:02:56.830 --> 00:02:56.840
public methods and classes and
 

00:02:56.840 --> 00:02:57.520
public methods and classes and
interfaces

00:02:57.520 --> 00:02:57.530
interfaces
 

00:02:57.530 --> 00:03:01.270
interfaces
we're deprecating 30 classes over 400

00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:01.280
we're deprecating 30 classes over 400
 

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:03.460
we're deprecating 30 classes over 400
methods that are no longer necessary

00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:03.470
methods that are no longer necessary
 

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:08.350
methods that are no longer necessary
because they're compact on 14 above so

00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:08.360
because they're compact on 14 above so
 

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:11.890
because they're compact on 14 above so
for example view compat set pivot X is

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:11.900
for example view compat set pivot X is
 

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:14.320
for example view compat set pivot X is
now going to show up as deprecated and

00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:14.330
now going to show up as deprecated and
 

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:16.449
now going to show up as deprecated and
you can replace that with a call to the

00:03:16.449 --> 00:03:16.459
you can replace that with a call to the
 

00:03:16.459 --> 00:03:18.880
you can replace that with a call to the
actual set pivot X method because that

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:18.890
actual set pivot X method because that
 

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:21.460
actual set pivot X method because that
exists there are some methods where we

00:03:21.460 --> 00:03:21.470
exists there are some methods where we
 

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:24.190
exists there are some methods where we
have workarounds for bugs in existing

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:24.200
have workarounds for bugs in existing
 

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:26.470
have workarounds for bugs in existing
versions so it may still be useful to be

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:26.480
versions so it may still be useful to be
 

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:28.870
versions so it may still be useful to be
calling view compat but anywhere that's

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:28.880
calling view compat but anywhere that's
 

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:30.370
calling view compat but anywhere that's
been deprecated you can go ahead and

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:30.380
been deprecated you can go ahead and
 

00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:31.930
been deprecated you can go ahead and
migrate away from and we'll be removing

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:31.940
migrate away from and we'll be removing
 

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:36.370
migrate away from and we'll be removing
those methods in a later version all

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:36.380
those methods in a later version all
 

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:37.900
those methods in a later version all
right so we've made it easier to develop

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:37.910
right so we've made it easier to develop
 

00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:40.030
right so we've made it easier to develop
with the android support library we're

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:40.040
with the android support library we're
 

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:41.949
with the android support library we're
also going to be improving the way that

00:03:41.949 --> 00:03:41.959
also going to be improving the way that
 

00:03:41.959 --> 00:03:43.830
also going to be improving the way that
you get the android support library

00:03:43.830 --> 00:03:43.840
you get the android support library
 

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:46.479
you get the android support library
we've modernized our distribution method

00:03:46.479 --> 00:03:46.489
we've modernized our distribution method
 

00:03:46.489 --> 00:03:53.550
we've modernized our distribution method
and added the google maven repository

00:03:53.550 --> 00:03:53.560
 
 

00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:56.830
 
so every time we update the support

00:03:56.830 --> 00:03:56.840
so every time we update the support
 

00:03:56.840 --> 00:03:58.899
so every time we update the support
library with a bug-fix you don't have to

00:03:58.899 --> 00:03:58.909
library with a bug-fix you don't have to
 

00:03:58.909 --> 00:04:02.020
library with a bug-fix you don't have to
download 500 megabytes of internal maven

00:04:02.020 --> 00:04:02.030
download 500 megabytes of internal maven
 

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:09.039
download 500 megabytes of internal maven
repository so we're including support

00:04:09.039 --> 00:04:09.049

we've made textview auto-sizing what

00:18:55.320 --> 00:18:55.330
we've made textview auto-sizing what
 

00:18:55.330 --> 00:18:56.820
we've made textview auto-sizing what
this means is you might have run into

00:18:56.820 --> 00:18:56.830
this means is you might have run into

translations come around and they're
 

00:19:03.340 --> 00:19:05.070
translations come around and they're
longer and they don't fit and you start

00:19:05.070 --> 00:19:05.080

can help you what we do is auto sizing

00:19:11.250 --> 00:19:11.260
can help you what we do is auto sizing
 

00:19:11.260 --> 00:19:13.019
can help you what we do is auto sizing
and we choose the size of the text

00:19:13.019 --> 00:19:13.029
and we choose the size of the text
 

00:19:13.029 --> 00:19:14.909
and we choose the size of the text
depending on the boundaries of the

00:19:14.909 --> 00:19:14.919
depending on the boundaries of the
 

00:19:14.919 --> 00:19:16.470
depending on the boundaries of the
textview so as you can see we will

screen drag something down and the touch
 

00:20:48.520 --> 00:20:51.060
screen drag something down and the touch
has some sense of velocity so you want

00:20:51.060 --> 00:20:51.070
has some sense of velocity so you want
 

00:20:51.070 --> 00:20:53.100
has some sense of velocity so you want
to fling something off the screen and

00:20:53.100 --> 00:20:53.110
to fling something off the screen and
 

00:20:53.110 --> 00:20:54.750
to fling something off the screen and
you want the velocity to match their

00:20:54.750 --> 00:20:54.760
you want the velocity to match their
 

00:20:54.760 --> 00:20:57.390
you want the velocity to match their
initial touch movement and you can run

00:20:57.390 --> 00:20:57.400
initial touch movement and you can run
 

00:20:57.400 --> 00:20:58.950
initial touch movement and you can run
those calculations and you can figure

00:20:58.950 --> 00:20:58.960
those calculations and you can figure
 

00:20:58.960 --> 00:21:00.480
those calculations and you can figure
out an interpolation curve that's going

before the animation started but it can
be a lot of work so dynamic animation is

equilibrium point or maybe you grab

00:21:25.080 --> 00:21:25.090
equilibrium point or maybe you grab
 

00:21:25.090 --> 00:21:26.370

looks like in practice is I have an
Android view a bug droid view and I

00:21:36.240 --> 00:21:36.250
Android view a bug droid view and I
 

00:21:36.250 --> 00:21:38.789
Android view a bug droid view and I
touch it and as I'm pulling it down we

00:21:38.789 --> 00:21:38.799
touch it and as I'm pulling it down we
 

00:21:38.799 --> 00:21:40.409
touch it and as I'm pulling it down we
start feeding touch events into a

00:21:40.409 --> 00:21:40.419
start feeding touch events into a
 

00:21:40.419 --> 00:21:42.990
start feeding touch events into a
velocity tracker so this knows how fast

00:21:42.990 --> 00:21:43.000
velocity tracker so this knows how fast
 

00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:44.700
velocity tracker so this knows how fast
the bug droid is going to be moving when

00:21:44.700 --> 00:21:44.710
the bug droid is going to be moving when
 

00:21:44.710 --> 00:21:47.070
the bug droid is going to be moving when
I let go of it as I'm moving it down

00:21:47.070 --> 00:21:47.080
I let go of it as I'm moving it down
 

00:21:47.080 --> 00:21:50.130
I let go of it as I'm moving it down
we're tracking the y translation so that

00:21:50.130 --> 00:21:50.140
we're tracking the y translation so that
 

00:21:50.140 --> 00:21:52.350
we're tracking the y translation so that
it follows my finger and when I remove

00:21:52.350 --> 00:21:52.360
it follows my finger and when I remove
 

00:21:52.360 --> 00:21:53.880
it follows my finger and when I remove
my finger we're going to start our

00:21:53.880 --> 00:21:53.890
my finger we're going to start our
 

00:21:53.890 --> 00:21:56.070
my finger we're going to start our
dynamic animation our spring animation

00:21:56.070 --> 00:21:56.080
dynamic animation our spring animation
 

00:21:56.080 --> 00:21:59.730
dynamic animation our spring animation
on our bug droid view so from code that

00:21:59.730 --> 00:21:59.740
on our bug droid view so from code that
 

00:21:59.740 --> 00:22:00.899
on our bug droid view so from code that
looks like this we're creating a new

00:22:00.899 --> 00:22:00.909
looks like this we're creating a new
 

00:22:00.909 --> 00:22:02.789
looks like this we're creating a new
spring animation on our bug droid view

00:22:02.789 --> 00:22:02.799
spring animation on our bug droid view
 

00:22:02.799 --> 00:22:04.110
spring animation on our bug droid view
we're going to be animating the

00:22:04.110 --> 00:22:04.120
we're going to be animating the
 

00:22:04.120 --> 00:22:06.450
we're going to be animating the
translation Y the vertical translation

interaction and when I let go of that I

00:22:10.320 --> 00:22:10.330
interaction and when I let go of that I
 

00:22:10.330 --> 00:22:11.850
interaction and when I let go of that I
want it to return to an equilibrium

00:22:11.850 --> 00:22:11.860
want it to return to an equilibrium
 

00:22:11.860 --> 00:22:14.639
want it to return to an equilibrium
state of zero translation Y so when

00:22:14.639 --> 00:22:14.649
state of zero translation Y so when
 

00:22:14.649 --> 00:22:16.580
state of zero translation Y so when
Springs up it's going to overshoot

00:22:16.580 --> 00:22:16.590
Springs up it's going to overshoot
 

00:22:16.590 --> 00:22:18.440
Springs up it's going to overshoot
it's going to overshoot and eventually

00:22:18.440 --> 00:22:18.450
it's going to overshoot and eventually
 

00:22:18.450 --> 00:22:20.389
it's going to overshoot and eventually
it's going to settle on zero translation

00:22:20.389 --> 00:22:20.399
it's going to settle on zero translation
 

00:22:20.399 --> 00:22:24.200
it's going to settle on zero translation
why is equilibrium spring animation uses

00:22:24.200 --> 00:22:24.210
why is equilibrium spring animation uses
 

00:22:24.210 --> 00:22:26.330
why is equilibrium spring animation uses
physical properties of Springs so the

00:22:26.330 --> 00:22:26.340
physical properties of Springs so the
 

00:22:26.340 --> 00:22:28.549
physical properties of Springs so the
damping ratio is how quickly the spring

00:22:28.549 --> 00:22:28.559
damping ratio is how quickly the spring
 

00:22:28.559 --> 00:22:30.830
damping ratio is how quickly the spring
is going to come to rest damping ratio

00:22:30.830 --> 00:22:30.840
is going to come to rest damping ratio
 

00:22:30.840 --> 00:22:33.139
is going to come to rest damping ratio
of zero would oscillate infinitely a

00:22:33.139 --> 00:22:33.149
of zero would oscillate infinitely a
 

00:22:33.149 --> 00:22:35.180
of zero would oscillate infinitely a
very high damping ratio will stop

00:22:35.180 --> 00:22:35.190
very high damping ratio will stop
 

00:22:35.190 --> 00:22:38.180
very high damping ratio will stop
animating very quickly stiffness is how

00:22:38.180 --> 00:22:38.190
animating very quickly stiffness is how
 

00:22:38.190 --> 00:22:39.830
animating very quickly stiffness is how
quickly the spring is going to snap back

00:22:39.830 --> 00:22:39.840
quickly the spring is going to snap back
 

00:22:39.840 --> 00:22:42.649
quickly the spring is going to snap back
so a very high stiffness when I pull the

00:22:42.649 --> 00:22:42.659
so a very high stiffness when I pull the
 

00:22:42.659 --> 00:22:44.360
so a very high stiffness when I pull the
spring down it's going to snap back

00:22:44.360 --> 00:22:44.370
spring down it's going to snap back
 

00:22:44.370 --> 00:22:46.580
spring down it's going to snap back
immediately a very low stiffness would

00:22:46.580 --> 00:22:46.590
immediately a very low stiffness would
 

00:22:46.590 --> 00:22:48.230
immediately a very low stiffness would
be like a car with a loose suspension

00:22:48.230 --> 00:22:48.240
be like a car with a loose suspension
 

00:22:48.240 --> 00:22:49.609
be like a car with a loose suspension
it's going to just bounce back and forth

00:22:49.609 --> 00:22:49.619
it's going to just bounce back and forth
 

00:22:49.619 --> 00:22:54.680
it's going to just bounce back and forth
slowly alright finally I want to pull in

00:22:54.680 --> 00:22:54.690
slowly alright finally I want to pull in
 

00:22:54.690 --> 00:22:56.210
slowly alright finally I want to pull in
the velocity that I've been tracking

00:22:56.210 --> 00:22:56.220
the velocity that I've been tracking
 

00:22:56.220 --> 00:22:58.009
the velocity that I've been tracking
this is the direct interaction portion

00:22:58.009 --> 00:22:58.019
this is the direct interaction portion
 

00:22:58.019 --> 00:23:00.859
this is the direct interaction portion
so I pull it down very quickly when I

00:23:00.859 --> 00:23:00.869
so I pull it down very quickly when I
 

00:23:00.869 --> 00:23:02.450
so I pull it down very quickly when I
lift my finger up I wanted to keep

00:23:02.450 --> 00:23:02.460
lift my finger up I wanted to keep
 

00:23:02.460 --> 00:23:04.549
lift my finger up I wanted to keep
moving with that energy if I move my

00:23:04.549 --> 00:23:04.559
moving with that energy if I move my
 

00:23:04.559 --> 00:23:06.169
moving with that energy if I move my
finger very slowly I'm going to lift my

00:23:06.169 --> 00:23:06.179
finger very slowly I'm going to lift my
 

00:23:06.179 --> 00:23:07.460
finger very slowly I'm going to lift my
finger up and I want it to start moving

00:23:07.460 --> 00:23:07.470
finger up and I want it to start moving
 

00:23:07.470 --> 00:23:09.409
finger up and I want it to start moving
back because there's very little energy

00:23:09.409 --> 00:23:09.419
back because there's very little energy
 

00:23:09.419 --> 00:23:10.930
back because there's very little energy
that my finger is putting into it and

00:23:10.930 --> 00:23:10.940
that my finger is putting into it and
 

00:23:10.940 --> 00:23:13.519
that my finger is putting into it and
finally we start our animation and we

00:23:13.519 --> 00:23:13.529
finally we start our animation and we
 

00:23:13.529 --> 00:23:15.230
finally we start our animation and we
end up with an android that snaps back

00:23:15.230 --> 00:23:15.240

hollow areas in the middle so here we

00:23:44.840 --> 00:23:44.850
hollow areas in the middle so here we
 

00:23:44.850 --> 00:23:47.570
hollow areas in the middle so here we
have a light bulb that has a single path

00:23:47.570 --> 00:23:47.580
have a light bulb that has a single path
 

00:23:47.580 --> 00:23:50.180
have a light bulb that has a single path
defining the entire area and it has some

case Photoshop uses a fill rule and this

00:24:17.419 --> 00:24:17.429
case Photoshop uses a fill rule and this
 

00:24:17.429 --> 00:24:19.700
case Photoshop uses a fill rule and this
defines what the inside of our vector

00:24:19.700 --> 00:24:19.710
defines what the inside of our vector
 

00:24:19.710 --> 00:24:22.070
defines what the inside of our vector
path is so you'll notice we have a

00:24:22.070 --> 00:24:22.080
path is so you'll notice we have a
 

00:24:22.080 --> 00:24:24.019
path is so you'll notice we have a
single path that defines our light bulb

00:24:24.019 --> 00:24:24.029
single path that defines our light bulb
 

00:24:24.029 --> 00:24:26.330
single path that defines our light bulb
we have a rule that tells the renderer

00:24:26.330 --> 00:24:26.340
we have a rule that tells the renderer
 

00:24:26.340 --> 00:24:28.909
we have a rule that tells the renderer
which is inside fill and which is

00:24:28.909 --> 00:24:28.919
which is inside fill and which is
 

00:24:28.919 --> 00:24:29.940
which is inside fill and which is
outside fill which is

00:24:29.940 --> 00:24:29.950
outside fill which is
 

00:24:29.950 --> 00:24:33.659
outside fill which is
transparent so this was added in the

00:24:33.659 --> 00:24:33.669
transparent so this was added in the
 

00:24:33.669 --> 00:24:36.299
transparent so this was added in the
framework in API 24 and we've now back

00:24:36.299 --> 00:24:36.309

framework in API 24 and we've now back
ported it to API 14 so the assets that

00:24:38.879 --> 00:24:38.889
ported it to API 14 so the assets that

so again these are some new features on

00:25:17.129 --> 00:25:17.139
so again these are some new features on
 

00:25:17.139 --> 00:25:18.539
so again these are some new features on
the platform that we're back porting to

00:25:18.539 --> 00:25:18.549
the platform that we're back porting to
 

00:25:18.549 --> 00:25:21.659
the platform that we're back porting to
API 14 you'll be using the same XML on

and here for path data morphing we're

00:25:28.350 --> 00:25:28.360
and here for path data morphing we're
 

00:25:28.360 --> 00:25:30.810
and here for path data morphing we're
going to be able to take an initial path

00:25:30.810 --> 00:25:30.820
going to be able to take an initial path
 

00:25:30.820 --> 00:25:33.840
going to be able to take an initial path
spec so the the long string of numbers

00:25:33.840 --> 00:25:33.850
spec so the the long string of numbers
 

00:25:33.850 --> 00:25:35.970

if you actually dive down into your
vector drawable paths one caveat here is

00:25:41.250 --> 00:25:41.260
vector drawable paths one caveat here is
 

00:25:41.260 --> 00:25:43.289
vector drawable paths one caveat here is
the path formats must match and this is

00:25:43.289 --> 00:25:43.299
the path formats must match and this is
 

00:25:43.299 --> 00:25:44.659
the path formats must match and this is
something that can be handled by tools

00:25:44.659 --> 00:25:44.669
something that can be handled by tools

00:25:51.450 --> 00:25:51.460
show so here's what path morphing looks
 

00:25:51.460 --> 00:25:54.509

familiar with in your Android apps

00:26:03.529 --> 00:26:03.539
 
 

00:26:03.539 --> 00:26:05.669
 
alright so let's look at what's going on

00:26:05.669 --> 00:26:05.679
alright so let's look at what's going on
 

00:26:05.679 --> 00:26:08.519
alright so let's look at what's going on
at the XML level we have vector drawable

00:26:08.519 --> 00:26:08.529
at the XML level we have vector drawable
 

00:26:08.529 --> 00:26:10.379
at the XML level we have vector drawable
defining our starting image a buffalo

00:26:10.379 --> 00:26:10.389
defining our starting image a buffalo
 

00:26:10.389 --> 00:26:12.419
defining our starting image a buffalo
and here I've extracted out our path

00:26:12.419 --> 00:26:12.429
and here I've extracted out our path
 

00:26:12.429 --> 00:26:15.240
and here I've extracted out our path
data for the buffalo so that long string

00:26:15.240 --> 00:26:15.250
data for the buffalo so that long string
 

00:26:15.250 --> 00:26:16.830
data for the buffalo so that long string
of letters and numbers that defines our

00:26:16.830 --> 00:26:16.840
of letters and numbers that defines our
 

00:26:16.840 --> 00:26:18.899
of letters and numbers that defines our
vector path I pulled that into a string

00:26:18.899 --> 00:26:18.909
vector path I pulled that into a string
 

00:26:18.909 --> 00:26:20.879
vector path I pulled that into a string
resource and we're going to be reusing

00:26:20.879 --> 00:26:20.889
resource and we're going to be reusing
 

00:26:20.889 --> 00:26:23.070
resource and we're going to be reusing
it in our animation and this also just

00:26:23.070 --> 00:26:23.080
it in our animation and this also just
 

00:26:23.080 --> 00:26:25.289
it in our animation and this also just
makes things way more readable so we

00:26:25.289 --> 00:26:25.299
makes things way more readable so we
 

00:26:25.299 --> 00:26:26.730
makes things way more readable so we
have our starting vector XML that we

00:26:26.730 --> 00:26:26.740
have our starting vector XML that we
 

00:26:26.740 --> 00:26:30.029
have our starting vector XML that we
want to a mate from and we have our

00:26:30.029 --> 00:26:30.039
want to a mate from and we have our
 

00:26:30.039 --> 00:26:32.129
want to a mate from and we have our
object animator now the new thing here

00:26:32.129 --> 00:26:32.139
object animator now the new thing here
 

00:26:32.139 --> 00:26:34.740
object animator now the new thing here
for API 14 and above is the ability to

00:26:34.740 --> 00:26:34.750
for API 14 and above is the ability to
 

00:26:34.750 --> 00:26:37.230
for API 14 and above is the ability to
specify path data as your property type

00:26:37.230 --> 00:26:37.240
specify path data as your property type
 

00:26:37.240 --> 00:26:39.419
specify path data as your property type
so we're going to value anim the value

00:26:39.419 --> 00:26:39.429
so we're going to value anim the value
 

00:26:39.429 --> 00:26:42.050
so we're going to value anim the value
from our buffalo path

00:26:42.050 --> 00:26:42.060
from our buffalo path
 

00:26:42.060 --> 00:26:44.450
from our buffalo path
back to our hippo path spec and this is

00:26:44.450 --> 00:26:44.460
back to our hippo path spec and this is
 

00:26:44.460 --> 00:26:45.920
back to our hippo path spec and this is
actually going to transform the points

00:26:45.920 --> 00:26:45.930
actually going to transform the points
 

00:26:45.930 --> 00:26:48.410
actually going to transform the points
and give us that morphing animation that

00:26:48.410 --> 00:26:48.420
and give us that morphing animation that
 

00:26:48.420 --> 00:26:52.280
and give us that morphing animation that
we saw we pull this all together into an

00:26:52.280 --> 00:26:52.290
we saw we pull this all together into an
 

00:26:52.290 --> 00:26:53.930
we saw we pull this all together into an
animated vector which points the

00:26:53.930 --> 00:26:53.940
animated vector which points the
 

00:26:53.940 --> 00:26:56.540
animated vector which points the
drawable to our starting buffalo the

00:26:56.540 --> 00:26:56.550
drawable to our starting buffalo the
 

00:26:56.550 --> 00:26:58.430
drawable to our starting buffalo the
target we're taking our Buffalo path

00:26:58.430 --> 00:26:58.440
target we're taking our Buffalo path
 

00:26:58.440 --> 00:26:59.930
target we're taking our Buffalo path
from that drawable and we're going to be

00:26:59.930 --> 00:26:59.940
from that drawable and we're going to be
 

00:26:59.940 --> 00:27:02.030
from that drawable and we're going to be
morphing the path data from a buffalo to

00:27:02.030 --> 00:27:02.040
morphing the path data from a buffalo to
 

00:27:02.040 --> 00:27:04.730
morphing the path data from a buffalo to
a hippo so we're going to take this a

00:27:04.730 --> 00:27:04.740
a hippo so we're going to take this a
 

00:27:04.740 --> 00:27:06.470
a hippo so we're going to take this a
little bit further and take advantage of

00:27:06.470 --> 00:27:06.480
little bit further and take advantage of
 

00:27:06.480 --> 00:27:09.830
little bit further and take advantage of
a feature in a apt to use a bundled XML

00:27:09.830 --> 00:27:09.840
a feature in a apt to use a bundled XML
 

00:27:09.840 --> 00:27:11.750
a feature in a apt to use a bundled XML
format so you may not have used this

00:27:11.750 --> 00:27:11.760
format so you may not have used this
 

00:27:11.760 --> 00:27:13.460
format so you may not have used this
before but it's really cool this is

00:27:13.460 --> 00:27:13.470
before but it's really cool this is
 

00:27:13.470 --> 00:27:16.160
before but it's really cool this is
supported on a through a apt so it's

00:27:16.160 --> 00:27:16.170
supported on a through a apt so it's
 

00:27:16.170 --> 00:27:18.140
supported on a through a apt so it's
backwards compatible we're going to take

00:27:18.140 --> 00:27:18.150
backwards compatible we're going to take
 

00:27:18.150 --> 00:27:21.920
backwards compatible we're going to take
this and we're going to take our

00:27:21.920 --> 00:27:21.930
this and we're going to take our
 

00:27:21.930 --> 00:27:24.560
this and we're going to take our
drawable and expand that out into an

00:27:24.560 --> 00:27:24.570
drawable and expand that out into an
 

00:27:24.570 --> 00:27:27.620
drawable and expand that out into an
after element and this replaces the

00:27:27.620 --> 00:27:27.630
after element and this replaces the
 

00:27:27.630 --> 00:27:29.420
after element and this replaces the
Android drawable attribute in our

00:27:29.420 --> 00:27:29.430
Android drawable attribute in our
 

00:27:29.430 --> 00:27:31.310
Android drawable attribute in our
animated vector element and we're going

00:27:31.310 --> 00:27:31.320
animated vector element and we're going
 

00:27:31.320 --> 00:27:34.190
animated vector element and we're going
to inline our initial drawable our

00:27:34.190 --> 00:27:34.200
to inline our initial drawable our
 

00:27:34.200 --> 00:27:36.140
to inline our initial drawable our
buffalo vector drawable XML in this

00:27:36.140 --> 00:27:36.150
buffalo vector drawable XML in this
 

00:27:36.150 --> 00:27:39.440
buffalo vector drawable XML in this
element so now we've gotten rid of our

00:27:39.440 --> 00:27:39.450
element so now we've gotten rid of our
 

00:27:39.450 --> 00:27:41.690
element so now we've gotten rid of our
Buffalo XML and we've centralized things

00:27:41.690 --> 00:27:41.700
Buffalo XML and we've centralized things
 

00:27:41.700 --> 00:27:43.760
Buffalo XML and we've centralized things
in our animal animal morph bundle dot

00:27:43.760 --> 00:27:43.770
in our animal animal morph bundle dot
 

00:27:43.770 --> 00:27:46.430
in our animal animal morph bundle dot
XML so if you're not reusing Buffalo XML

00:27:46.430 --> 00:27:46.440
XML so if you're not reusing Buffalo XML
 

00:27:46.440 --> 00:27:48.350
XML so if you're not reusing Buffalo XML
you just need it for this animation it

00:27:48.350 --> 00:27:48.360
you just need it for this animation it
 

00:27:48.360 --> 00:27:49.970
you just need it for this animation it
can really simplify and clean up your

we're gonna do the same thing with our

00:27:52.790 --> 00:27:52.800
we're gonna do the same thing with our
 

00:27:52.800 --> 00:27:55.520
we're gonna do the same thing with our
animation and now we have everything

00:27:55.520 --> 00:27:55.530
animation and now we have everything
 

00:27:55.530 --> 00:27:57.890
animation and now we have everything
neatly contained in one file so the only

00:27:57.890 --> 00:27:57.900
neatly contained in one file so the only
 

00:27:57.900 --> 00:27:59.210
neatly contained in one file so the only

thing that we're going to reference from
 

00:27:59.220 --> 00:28:01.610

our layout XML or reference from code is

00:28:01.610 --> 00:28:01.620
our layout XML or reference from code is
 

00:28:01.620 --> 00:28:04.610
our layout XML or reference from code is
our animal morph bundle drawable and we

00:28:04.610 --> 00:28:04.620
our animal morph bundle drawable and we
 

00:28:04.620 --> 00:28:06.830
our animal morph bundle drawable and we
don't need to keep a separate animation

00:28:06.830 --> 00:28:06.840
don't need to keep a separate animation
 

00:28:06.840 --> 00:28:09.410
don't need to keep a separate animation

down to API 14 through a apt alright
we've also back ported support for

00:28:30.140 --> 00:28:30.150
we've also back ported support for
 

00:28:30.150 --> 00:28:32.510
we've also back ported support for
interpolation along a path so this

00:28:32.510 --> 00:28:32.520
interpolation along a path so this
 

00:28:32.520 --> 00:28:34.250
interpolation along a path so this
provides parity with the platform AVD

00:28:34.250 --> 00:28:34.260
provides parity with the platform AVD
 

00:28:34.260 --> 00:28:36.590
provides parity with the platform AVD
again and this is going to allow you to

00:28:36.590 --> 00:28:36.600
again and this is going to allow you to
 

00:28:36.600 --> 00:28:38.990
again and this is going to allow you to
set the interpolator on your object

00:28:38.990 --> 00:28:39.000
set the interpolator on your object
 

00:28:39.000 --> 00:28:41.540
set the interpolator on your object

they want us to shrink down a square but

00:29:04.790 --> 00:29:04.800
they want us to shrink down a square but
 

00:29:04.800 --> 00:29:06.110
they want us to shrink down a square but
they wanted to have an interesting

00:29:07.679 --> 00:29:09.290
acceleration curve as it's shrinking
down so we're going to shrink down real

00:29:09.290 --> 00:29:09.300
down so we're going to shrink down real
 

00:29:09.300 --> 00:29:11.660

so we're our curve is quickly reducing

00:29:32.299 --> 00:29:32.309
so we're our curve is quickly reducing
 

00:29:32.309 --> 00:29:35.450

bit and then we're slowly tapering off
 

00:29:37.290 --> 00:29:39.590
bit and then we're slowly tapering off
to zero and this is what you see when it

00:32:20.950 --> 00:32:22.500
the implementation of this let's say we
want to store preferences in the cloud

00:32:22.500 --> 00:32:22.510
want to store preferences in the cloud
 

00:32:22.510 --> 00:32:24.570
want to store preferences in the cloud
will extend preference data store the

00:32:24.570 --> 00:32:24.580
will extend preference data store the
 

00:32:24.580 --> 00:32:27.210
will extend preference data store the
new class and we'll override here just

00:32:27.210 --> 00:32:27.220
new class and we'll override here just
 

00:32:27.220 --> 00:32:29.490
new class and we'll override here just
get boolean and put boolean so when we

00:32:29.490 --> 00:32:29.500
get boolean and put boolean so when we
 

00:32:29.500 --> 00:32:31.620
get boolean and put boolean so when we
put a boolean preference in we're going

00:32:31.620 --> 00:32:31.630
put a boolean preference in we're going
 

00:32:31.630 --> 00:32:33.390
put a boolean preference in we're going
to start some asynchronous call that

00:32:33.390 --> 00:32:33.400
to start some asynchronous call that
 

00:32:33.400 --> 00:32:35.610
to start some asynchronous call that
stores it in the cloud now because we

00:32:35.610 --> 00:32:35.620
stores it in the cloud now because we
 

00:32:35.620 --> 00:32:37.020
stores it in the cloud now because we
want to be able to retrieve a value

00:32:37.020 --> 00:32:37.030
want to be able to retrieve a value
 

00:32:37.030 --> 00:32:39.030

00:32:41.080 --> 00:32:43.020
interaction we're going to store this
locally as well and an important thing

00:32:43.020 --> 00:32:43.030
locally as well and an important thing
 

00:32:43.030 --> 00:32:44.760
locally as well and an important thing
to keep in mind with this class is that

00:32:44.760 --> 00:32:44.770
to keep in mind with this class is that
 

00:32:44.770 --> 00:32:46.590
