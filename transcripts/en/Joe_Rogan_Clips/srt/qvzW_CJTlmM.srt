1
00:00:00,040 --> 00:00:02,820
And there's so much clickbait out there
because it's such an effective way to

2
00:00:02,821 --> 00:00:04,920
get people to pay attention to
things because it's, as you said,

3
00:00:05,100 --> 00:00:08,970
people focus on failure and negative
and anger. That's who we want to see.

4
00:00:09,110 --> 00:00:13,650
Controversy. That's what we want to see.
People would want to see the anger and,

5
00:00:13,910 --> 00:00:18,540
and you know, why do you think that
is? Because it's just the times.

6
00:00:19,020 --> 00:00:23,730
It's, it's, that's what's
cool. Now, is that what it is?
The coolest being negative.

7
00:00:23,970 --> 00:00:26,970
You know how you always have
some people is a great example.

8
00:00:26,971 --> 00:00:31,260
How you have people who mean you
can talk about a movie. All right.

9
00:00:31,650 --> 00:00:34,740
We didn't talk about
titanic. Wow. And Titanic,

10
00:00:34,830 --> 00:00:38,220
one of the biggest movies of all
time. Fucking great movie. He'll, yes,

11
00:00:38,221 --> 00:00:41,520
it was great movie. And why guy for
no reason to go. I fucking hated it.

12
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:48,790
Why? Yeah, like titanic.
Fucking bullshit. Why Manga?

13
00:00:48,860 --> 00:00:52,110
The odd Noah.
Now tell me why.

14
00:00:52,130 --> 00:00:54,690
Why did you hate it that
Tom told you about that?

15
00:00:55,620 --> 00:00:57,870
The cool thing is just being different.

16
00:00:58,650 --> 00:01:02,510
I wanna I want to be completely
opposite than all even true positive.

17
00:01:02,511 --> 00:01:06,980
You know what? Nah, Nah,
Nah. That shit was ass. Wow.

18
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:08,670
Wow.
Wow.

19
00:01:09,090 --> 00:01:14,020
Why was it as you have people that just
like to do that? Oh yeah, for sure. And,

20
00:01:14,060 --> 00:01:18,900
and what happens when one person does it?
Another person for no reason. I'll go.

21
00:01:18,901 --> 00:01:23,520
Yeah, me too. Yeah, that shit was
ass, man. I, I ain't like it either.

22
00:01:24,150 --> 00:01:25,800
Did you see it?
Which I'll talk about.

23
00:01:26,970 --> 00:01:28,290
You don't have to know
what they're talking about,

24
00:01:28,530 --> 00:01:33,360
but you just want to hop on the negative
train because that's what's cool.

25
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:37,950
It's not cool to be positive.
It's not cool to be happy.

26
00:01:38,160 --> 00:01:39,240
I don't know if it's a cool thing.

27
00:01:39,241 --> 00:01:42,530
I think it's usually people
that are really frustrated
with their lives. 100% of,

28
00:01:42,540 --> 00:01:46,170
what's the, that's the factual side to
it. I did a joke before, it was like,

29
00:01:46,171 --> 00:01:49,920
do you think Michael Jordan leaves
Youtube comments? Like, I bet he does now.

30
00:01:52,390 --> 00:01:55,620
That's awful winters. No, not at all.

31
00:01:55,621 --> 00:01:58,920
Type of people that want to get mad and
complain constantly about shit like that.

32
00:01:58,950 --> 00:02:01,740
Do you know what it takes
to do this right here?

33
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:08,970
Right here. I'll tell you how I feel
right in your comments section. Joe Rogan,

34
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,950
you can kiss my ass.

35
00:02:11,070 --> 00:02:15,480
You know what that takes you or what do
you have going on that you have the time

36
00:02:16,350 --> 00:02:21,350
to just simply be that negative and
do it in this world and it's just a

37
00:02:21,901 --> 00:02:23,880
mismanagement of your time.

38
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:29,360
Time is so valuable and I don't think
people understand how valuable they can be

39
00:02:31,050 --> 00:02:35,730
if they use their time correctly. Yeah.
Yes. Now, have you always been like this?

40
00:02:35,731 --> 00:02:40,350
If you always put this fucking
guy, man, but always, always.

41
00:02:40,380 --> 00:02:44,670
Really.
I find a light in every dark tunnel.

42
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:49,680
I will find a goddamn
light, man. I hear it all.

43
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:53,130
You'd listen when I tell you to wait
on my back is so heavy of all the stuff

44
00:02:53,131 --> 00:02:55,020
that I deal with and I'm fine.

45
00:02:55,470 --> 00:02:59,310
The reason why I'm fine is
because I'm genuinely happy.

46
00:03:00,220 --> 00:03:04,540
I'm happy and I'm not happy
just because of the success.

47
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:06,850
The success x is a bonus.

48
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:12,360
I'm happy because I truly know the
definition and the feeling that comes with

49
00:03:13,031 --> 00:03:16,270
happiness. I truly know it. I felt it.

50
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:19,930
I felt it when I said, Yo,
what really makes me happy?

51
00:03:20,350 --> 00:03:24,550
And I look at heaven and Hendrickson, I
look Hizo. I look at my wife, I go, Yo,

52
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:29,350
I didn't have the family shit when
I was coming up. Y'All got one.

53
00:03:30,450 --> 00:03:33,880
I got one. Look, what I
done did, look what I built.

54
00:03:34,690 --> 00:03:38,500
These people depend on me. I provide
for these people. That makes me happy.

55
00:03:39,250 --> 00:03:43,780
That makes me happy. When my daughter
comes up, dad, you're not only my dad,

56
00:03:43,781 --> 00:03:47,950
you're my best friend. Yo,
I'm happy. That's my world.

57
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:52,600
So everything else from the outside
that comes in, you're, you're,

58
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:57,340
you're throwing shit at a, at a,
at a bubble that can't be popped.

59
00:03:57,910 --> 00:03:59,200
There's a force field around me.

60
00:03:59,910 --> 00:04:02,140
There's a force field around
me because what matters,

61
00:04:02,620 --> 00:04:06,010
what really matters
loves me whole heartedly.

62
00:04:06,100 --> 00:04:11,100
And when you had that and you
understand that you're unbreakable,

63
00:04:12,190 --> 00:04:14,680
so if you don't add to that force field,

64
00:04:14,681 --> 00:04:18,100
if you don't make my force field
stronger, you don't, you don't,

65
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:23,590
you don't get time from me.
My team hartbeat productions,

66
00:04:23,591 --> 00:04:26,620
the people underneath my umbrella.
You're a part of my force field.

67
00:04:27,010 --> 00:04:30,790
You believe what I believe
we all see the same things.

68
00:04:30,791 --> 00:04:33,130
We want the same things.

69
00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:38,410
So we march with the same beat.
You can't,

70
00:04:38,411 --> 00:04:39,910
you can't shake that.

71
00:04:40,630 --> 00:04:45,630
We are an individual that seen that and
understands that if you've never felt

72
00:04:45,821 --> 00:04:50,050
that, if you have no idea what that
feels like and it's easy to shake you.

73
00:04:51,340 --> 00:04:54,010
That's why some people are easily broken.

74
00:04:55,570 --> 00:04:59,050
Being broken is not a hard thing.
It's not a hard thing.

75
00:04:59,051 --> 00:05:02,740
So those that do get broken, those that
do get down, those that do get depressed.

76
00:05:02,860 --> 00:05:06,790
I understand, I understand. I don't,

77
00:05:06,791 --> 00:05:10,540
I don't knock people for it. Mm.
I don't knock anybody for it.

78
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:15,720
What I also understand is
that the encouragement that
can come from so many can

79
00:05:16,301 --> 00:05:20,140
add value for those that
may need a little push,

80
00:05:20,890 --> 00:05:22,750
that may need a little amen.
Picky Chyna.

81
00:05:23,650 --> 00:05:28,650
It's so easy to be that positive
reinforcement for somebody and add value.

82
00:05:30,100 --> 00:05:34,810
It's so easy. But some people choose to
throw that aside and kick while your dad.

83
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:35,960
Mm.

84
00:05:36,100 --> 00:05:40,780
I try to put out the light of positivity
because whoever's out there you,

85
00:05:40,930 --> 00:05:42,670
I don't know what it could
do for somebody else,

86
00:05:42,671 --> 00:05:44,740
but somebody else may just simply
look at him and say, Yo, to wait.

87
00:05:44,750 --> 00:05:48,630
He embraces his kids. It makes me
want to be a better father. Yoda,

88
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:51,910
where did this man doesn't stop in a
way that every day he wakes up and he's

89
00:05:51,911 --> 00:05:53,500
just positive,
regardless of what's going on,

90
00:05:53,610 --> 00:05:58,460
makes me realize that this shit ain't
so bad the way he gets up and says, Hey,

91
00:05:58,940 --> 00:06:02,540
today's another day. It's a morning. Let's
all be better than we were yesterday.

92
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:04,310
Somebody probably needed to hear that.

93
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:08,210
The more that I can give that out and
I can take my platform to throw good

94
00:06:08,211 --> 00:06:09,044
energy out,

95
00:06:09,140 --> 00:06:14,140
I'm doing my part because there's so
many that thought the complete opposite.

96
00:06:15,710 --> 00:06:19,970
Yeah. I don't want to be a part of that.
That's beautiful man, and that's true.

97
00:06:20,030 --> 00:06:24,350
I believe you. It's not, it's
not forced. It's not phony. Yeah.

98
00:06:24,470 --> 00:06:25,400
It's not fake.

99
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:30,960
That shit every day I hear shit every day.
It's very contagious too.

100
00:06:31,180 --> 00:06:33,110
I had a lady, I lady, right?

101
00:06:39,190 --> 00:06:41,810
Lady rolled down a window.
She goes,

102
00:06:41,811 --> 00:06:43,610
where are you going to
make a good movie again?

103
00:06:49,310 --> 00:06:53,630
I said, did you see the upside? I
thought the upside was good. What's that?

104
00:06:54,440 --> 00:06:58,640
Oh Shit. Some movie. It's one of
my movies that's out us think.

105
00:06:58,890 --> 00:07:01,730
I think it's a good movie.
I didn't see that.

106
00:07:03,810 --> 00:07:08,660
All right, ma'am. You have a beautiful
day. That's, yeah. All right.

107
00:07:09,990 --> 00:07:12,280
That's it.
That's it.

108
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:21,050
With such conviction, like literally
I could have said a lot of shit.

109
00:07:21,051 --> 00:07:23,780
Like she rolled her window down.
You could tell she still had the crank.

110
00:07:24,670 --> 00:07:26,320
I got to set a lot of shit

111
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:31,580
girls. A lot of things that
I can say to you, ma'am,

112
00:07:32,030 --> 00:07:34,850
where are you going to make a good movie?
It's snapping

113
00:07:36,530 --> 00:07:40,820
that one out. The upside. You see
the other side? What's that? Oh,

114
00:07:40,821 --> 00:07:45,350
it's a movie out now. Amazing that
that's how she chose to come out here.

115
00:07:45,410 --> 00:07:49,010
I see it. I get it. She chooses
to come at you with a negative.

116
00:07:49,130 --> 00:07:53,780
I get it every day when you won't be
funny again and I'm trying my best,

117
00:07:55,220 --> 00:07:59,030
trying my best. If it's not working
for you, hopefully I do better soon.

118
00:07:59,750 --> 00:08:04,310
What do you, what do you, what am
I going to feed into that and why?

119
00:08:04,311 --> 00:08:07,700
Why, why, why? For what?

120
00:08:08,750 --> 00:08:12,800
For what?
It seems to have been working thus far.

121
00:08:13,190 --> 00:08:17,540
Are you getting this positive attitude
towards life from life experience?

122
00:08:17,541 --> 00:08:21,350
Are you getting it from books?
Did someone teach you how to find this?

123
00:08:21,380 --> 00:08:26,380
I'm getting it from the
experiences and from the,

124
00:08:27,380 --> 00:08:32,380
the real understanding of
perfection doesn't exist.

125
00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:35,501
Don't exist.

126
00:08:35,501 --> 00:08:40,501
Yo know we're in a time right now
where people expect perfection.

127
00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:44,270
You expect perfection and I
don't know where this came from.

128
00:08:44,271 --> 00:08:48,350
I don't know what happened.
That this is the criteria for living.

129
00:08:49,550 --> 00:08:54,200
My true understanding is, all right,
you got one life and that one life.

130
00:08:55,440 --> 00:09:00,440
The goal for us is to live it to the
best of our ability from the beginning to

131
00:09:02,071 --> 00:09:06,390
what said the n in the middle
and the beginning. Middle.

132
00:09:07,140 --> 00:09:09,570
You're going to do things. You're going
to make mistakes. You're going to fuck up.

133
00:09:10,170 --> 00:09:15,170
You're supposed to learn and then move
forward with the understanding of what

134
00:09:15,301 --> 00:09:20,040
not to do and when you move forward.
Live may get better, it may not,

135
00:09:20,041 --> 00:09:24,060
but somewhere along the lines is going
to click and everything that went through

136
00:09:24,061 --> 00:09:28,380
back here was supposed to happen
so that now that I'm here,

137
00:09:29,130 --> 00:09:34,130
I'm able to go ahead with such a high
level of knowledge and I can make other

138
00:09:36,001 --> 00:09:40,050
people better. I can make myself
better. I could do more from a family.

139
00:09:40,140 --> 00:09:43,440
Something happens.
My Dad is the prime example,

140
00:09:43,980 --> 00:09:48,540
crazy drug addict and I'm out of jail.
Life was very bad,

141
00:09:49,140 --> 00:09:52,230
very fucking bad for my dead son,

142
00:09:52,231 --> 00:09:55,710
got successful son,
then took money,

143
00:09:56,310 --> 00:09:59,880
gave it to his day. Here's
your house, here's your truck.

144
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:04,860
Here's your monthly. At this age,
I want you to live your life.

145
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:09,660
You may have mistakes. You can't rebuild
and correct the things you've done.

146
00:10:10,530 --> 00:10:14,250
I'm your son. I love you. You
can't go back in and Redo.

147
00:10:14,310 --> 00:10:18,510
You can't try to keep going backwards
and about me. You got grandkids.

148
00:10:19,710 --> 00:10:23,130
Go be the best grandpop you can be for
these grandkids. That's your focus now.

149
00:10:23,790 --> 00:10:27,180
Where's this energy devoted to
being a grandpa for the grandkids?

150
00:10:27,810 --> 00:10:30,540
Don't worry about me,
but something happened in your life.

151
00:10:31,260 --> 00:10:36,260
Something happened that took you into the
direction to reap the benefits of your

152
00:10:36,781 --> 00:10:38,280
son's happiness and success.

153
00:10:38,370 --> 00:10:41,310
My energy is now contagious is
enough and I hand it to you,

154
00:10:42,030 --> 00:10:45,510
so now you're able to give that off to
all these other people that you're around.

155
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:51,320
Something happens and that's an every
single life in every life I under stand

156
00:10:53,071 --> 00:10:57,630
that there's a payoff for bad
eventually cause a pay off.

157
00:10:58,080 --> 00:10:59,880
It can't be bad,
but for so long,

158
00:11:00,610 --> 00:11:05,010
if you got the strength and
the understanding to realize
that shit will change,

159
00:11:05,690 --> 00:11:09,390
it will change. It's impossible.
It's just like poker.

160
00:11:09,930 --> 00:11:12,600
I don't know if you play poker
nut, I don't. You play poker.

161
00:11:12,601 --> 00:11:16,590
You can run bad forever,
but it will eventually turn around.

162
00:11:16,740 --> 00:11:18,930
Once you grasp the
understanding of the game,

163
00:11:19,620 --> 00:11:22,750
eventually it's going to
turn around blackjack.

164
00:11:22,760 --> 00:11:23,880
You're never going to be at the casino,

165
00:11:24,330 --> 00:11:27,300
but eventually you're going to have
a good run. If you catch a run,

166
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:29,460
you'll do good.
Get the fuck out of there.

167
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:33,750
You waited long enough for it
to happen here, come catch it.

168
00:11:33,840 --> 00:11:38,700
Leave anything in life
will eventually tie. Good.

169
00:11:38,910 --> 00:11:39,120
Now.
