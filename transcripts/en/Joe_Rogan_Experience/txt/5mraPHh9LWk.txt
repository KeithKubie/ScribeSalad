Speaker 1:          00:00:00       One, two, three.

Speaker 2:          00:00:04       [inaudible]. So

Speaker 1:          00:00:34       the demand, Leonard Skinner, the actual man landscape died. Is that what happened? Yeah, I guess he was like a gym coach. Hang on, let me eat this Mike Condoms. Yeah, he was at on them free day. He was, yeah. Evidently the gym teacher that they named their band after. Really? Yeah. So He's dead. That's it. That's a wrap. We all go folks, uh, this, this show as all are sponsored by the fleshlight. Uh, if you have not tried one, Doug Stanhope, and I know we were discussing this before the break, but we decided to save it. You have not, I have not fucked a fleshlight. Oh, you're still a fan of masturbation. Everything. Only in the most clinical medicinal, like quickly get this out of me way. You don't spend any time like lusting, no lust, no. None whatsoever. When did that stop happening? I gradually over years, I mean, I remember even at the man show, I'd fucking no interest in the jug ease, just so dull.

Speaker 1:          00:01:29       At a certain point in time in your life, you're forcing it. If you're still chasing it, you're forcing it. It's like, what are you doing? Yeah. Well, I remember if you had told me a 20 are, you'll lose your sex drive it like what would you do if you weren't trying to fuck people like, and then you'd think at 43 what could I have done with my life if I wasn't just trying to fucking blow loads and chicks? Well, I, I definitely haven't stopped beating off, but I see where it's ridiculous. I just want to to cam ones by the way. Huh? I just fucked one of the canned ones. Totally different than the other one was like a drunk, sloppy chick. Oh, it's really sloppy and loose in our own flashlight. Get on that shit. Oh, it was good. It was a manufacturing issue.

Speaker 1:          00:02:10       It's mixing up your bitches. It was good. It was meant for a different kinds of Brian. It's, this is what it's meant for a girth here. See, it looks like a beer and a, you opened up top and it's a fake vagina. That's the idea behind. Good. I'm Brian is not a fan of this one. I fucked up. I fucked a rubber vagina once and blew a load in it and then fucking just put it, put it away and then a couple days later I grabbed it and it fucking stunk. Like all get out to look at this one. It's a, it's a fake vampire. Yeah, that's the, it's a vampire mouth. The twilight series. All right. What is wrong with people? If the aliens didn't need more evidence that were retarded and it's time to land, look at this fucking thing. Look at this thing. Can they see it? Yeah. Come on man. Really

Speaker 3:          00:03:02       wake me up by your mouth that you fuck what? Yeah, they're good though. They're great. Very good. As far as masturbation since or anything, I'll try one. And if you think about it in terms of just being pragmatic and doing body maintenance, when you shoot a load with this, you're going to shoot a bigger load and it's going to take a couple more days for you to build up. No one could call you a sellout for this. Like I asked all traps blue ribbon sponsor a tour and I like switch beer and for a minute like I've got, oh, it's, I'm going to get drunk anyway. Who gives a shit? What kind of beer? I'm drinking, not selling out. There's something about Pabst blue ribbon that's become cool again. Like the fact that it sucks. It's, yeah, it's, it's, it's been that way for a while. Yeah. Yeah. The fact that it blows is the selling point.

Speaker 3:          00:03:47       Yeah. It didn't used to be right. [inaudible] hipsters to the poor thing. $3 PBR. I just don't like drinking out of cans on stage. That was my big beef. Get a fucking bottle. There's a dude as a comic in New York named Jon Tobin and um, when we were, uh, I was living, I know that name. He's does a radio show and a, I think in Buffalo, someone upstate New York. Anyway, yeah. When we were, uh, I was in my early twenties, we got fucking wicked drunk on, um, on 40 ounces, like black beer, you know, like old English and track man cobras one size 18. And I had just moved to La and we drank that, I don't know, maybe three of them and I was passed out on a sidewalk. Yeah, we had these and we watched a show a of the movie superfly and did commentary on supply.

Speaker 3:          00:04:32       Just two white guys talking like black guys drunk out of their fucking mind of forties on forties it's a different kind of drunk. It's a reckless trunk engineered by the government. It's pretty, pretty clear. Alex Jones was saying that something is given men estrogen, which is causing men to be gay was like toothpaste or some shit. It was one of my favorite ones. He's ever die manager. Said he saw you on an Alex Jones. I haven't seen it yet, but he said it was hilarious how you'd bug to the camera when he was going fucking crazy. You just look at the camera and go. Well it was a double whammy of crazy cause I was on with Eddie Bravo and he probably wants to talk about chem trails because Eddie Bravo, I love him to death, but any problems convinced that the government's spray and shit on us. It's a fucking crazy story and I even tried to come to Eddie Bravo with some science.

Speaker 3:          00:05:20       I said, well I know this dude who's a pilot and he explained to me that those clouds are created by a certain amount of moisture in the atmosphere combined with the turbines at the jet engine and it creates these clouds. That's what happens. But this video's on youtube, man, his videos and he just won't buy it, man. He just, he's convinced. So here we are. I'm trapped. And Alex Jones, well I'm doing a documentary on that right now. The government is definitely spraying us. It's a hell of an Alex. And then Eddie Bravo is going jam once this documentary coming out and I'm going fuck spraying the population like they have that day. When did he do it at night? There'll be a lot of people. The airmen. Yeah. This is a giant. He's this cut to syphilis. Yeah. Yeah. That's what it is. A giant one for the whole population.

Speaker 3:          00:06:06       It's not really working. It's kind of a real slow process but there can to keep the spray gun trance. Have you ever seen those up? Like trucks are good on your street and spray for bugs and like in the middle of the night like that more scary cause that's really, the government definitely has worked on some weather. And don't get me wrong, I mean I think for sure they have sprayed people at certain point in time, you know there's video when people can say, oh there was some shit and I'm sure they probably tried it. I mean, but it's probably very specific areas and the V for a very specific reason and some fucked up experiment that didn't let the people know they were in on. But I'm sure they did it or not doing it every day here too, aren't they here? They're getting sprayed onto, yeah. Yeah man.

Speaker 3:          00:06:43       But I'm immune to that shit. Yeah. He posted this one photo that was really crazy. And then I went and I was like, wait, where was this photo taken? Airport? No, no, no. It was right next to lax. And I'm like, cause I found a store behind him was like the stores that I googled the name of that store. And I found out that he was right next to lax when he took that photo and on he believes in it. Man, he believes that they're a man who knows really bad on his show because I couldn't really like, you know, bust on him cause I know him. We've known him for years. Jones. Yeah. But I couldn't take them seriously and I couldn't, he was evidently thought I was coming in as more of a on his side guy. Yeah. Cause he hasn't seen me since we did that Kevin Booth DVD.

Speaker 3:          00:07:23       I always try to find things that I do believe. I try to be as friendly as possible with them. I really like Alex as a person. He's a fun guy. I enjoy going to the, we went to the fights with them, we ate with them, we hung out with him. He's a good guy. He's just, he's just crazy and all wound up and everything. So I was trying to find some common ground where I actually agree on them. Like I always bring up some stuff like you know like a operation Northwoods. Yeah. That's the one. That's the good one. And you know, of course you can get into the Kennedy assassination, but that gets a little gray. It's like, who knows what really happened there. Yeah. I can't put together last year very well. So fucking the further back in history, the more open to interpretation.

Speaker 3:          00:08:01       There's some shit though. That's really interesting that, uh, that he turned me onto. One of them was, uh, uh, one called operation midnight climax where the government ran brothels in New York and in San Francisco and where they did LSD, LSD. Yeah. That's John's. That's true. Yeah. And he turned me on to that and I was like, wow. And again, once you see that those things are real, Northwoods and mk ultra, all that, yeah. Then you go, well, they could be doing anything and then you realize, I don't give a fuck. Yeah, I agree. It doesn't affect my day. I've been coming to that exact same conclusion that there's certain things in life that you're putting all your energy towards and they're not helping you at all. Right. You know, nor are they stopping anything. You're not helping the cause, you know you're not out there, but you know, but it is worth I guess pointing out so that maybe someone somewhere along the line here are some of the shit you say and laughs at it and thinks maybe know. It's almost even

Speaker 1:          00:08:56       one direction or another. It's almost like being at a magic show and being able to go, I know how you did that. Yes. All right. You're still going to have a show. I'm not going to fuck up your whole Vegas experience, but I know how you did it. So chicken based on some comics yelling that out. Maybe it just makes them up their game. Maybe that's all. It's something that stuff I'm interested in, but I had to stop with that. Making yourself so Alex Jones, like where you just get crazy. Yeah, I'll be at three o'clock in the morning. I'll be fucking clicking on some link about some new loophole that Goldman Sachs use and some fucking Matt Taibbi article and I'm just going fuck me to stop your business knowing not only that, I don't, what the fuck am I going to do? What am I gonna do?

Speaker 1:          00:09:36       Am I going to devote my whole life to this? You know, I could, shit I like to do. Yeah. I want to know how many times Alex Jones shows up at a city council meeting about fucking streets sweeping laws. There's some not something he can affect. Yeah, that's interesting. You probably doesn't ever do that. Yeah. What about do that Doug? Stan hope. But right now demons are ascending upon our government. They are deep embedded in our political system. Doug Stanhope, you go on the road, you'd tell your jokes, you think all swell and good because are you dying FEMA camps? So don't worry about the volume mean birds. I was trying to do my, uh, my, uh, I can't do it. Well, what's his name? Fucking conspiracy theory. Oh, just Jesse Ventura that show they conspiracy theories look so bad. Like we don't realize there's Rumsfeld, he's trying to tell me that the Kennedy assassination might have been, yeah, one low.

Speaker 1:          00:10:36       Not Real. Well, no, they overproduce it. So he sits down with his writers like and they, they hit them to some conspiracy that he's not aware of, but I'm going to go right up. And then he's surprised that a former governor just can't walk into the CIA and look at fine whenever he wants. The former pro dumb founded, this was reduction of here's where your rights are going. [inaudible] gentleman who talks like this, this is how we're a little bit of a load in his mouth just to, just to, just like he looked at Tim, let's just floating around with her for middle shoulder governor from Torah. Did you see him on the opiate Anthony when Jim Norton tore him apart? No, no I didn't. Fucking beautiful. He got douchey with Darren. He got bullied with Norton and the last thing you should do is get bullied with Norton.

Speaker 1:          00:11:24       Cause that's what people have done to him his whole life. And he's like, fuck you. He was like physically intimidating. And when, when he's talking about like a legitimate question about nine 11 or whatever it is, conspiracy theories, and he's legitimately questioned him, you know, in a, in a, in a, in a a really not a condescending way at all. And Torah gets fucking crazy. And then Norton gets crazy back and Ventura winds up leaving and walking off the shot. What do you want to hear it? Do you want to hear it? Yeah, here we go. Yeah, let's put it, it's great because it's like the most comics were picked on. Most comics were, would do shit

Speaker 3:          00:11:54       around when we were younger. Yeah. And the last thing comics like is a bully, right? You know, if someone like this, so this was like, when I, when I heard it, I immediately texted him and called him up and when I saw him I said it was the most awesome thing I've ever seen. It was beautiful because Jim Norton is a fleshy ball of 150 pounds and Jesse Ventura is a fucking former navy seal, his big giant head. And he's, what was he getting in his face? He just got stupid with them. You know, it's like the way he describes things. If I take this out of the stand, well no, he's not the God damn comic. Good. Can I keep trying to lean into it? Uh, yeah. Yeah. The stand is an awkward situation. This whole couch was a terrible idea. I mean, I need something.

Speaker 3:          00:12:35       I can't look over there because not only do I not like to see myself, but it's a delay. So I'm seeing myself minutes ago. I'll have to look at it. I'll show. All right. Yeah. I don't like looking at fucking, we used to have a chat in the chat. The problem with the shadows, who would be like, fuck good. shop.call. Calm, calm, calm. Like the chat would be flooded, bigger tech. Suck my dick or tick like a hundred times in a row. And you'd be like, Oh God, it's such a fucking outlet of hate. The whole Internet. I never like Google search my name or anything like that. Oh, that was awesome. That was Google saying cos he smirked. Be smirk. He's Marcus. Every fucking show I do. People will yell out to every show, every show, but fuck it if people are yelling shit out.

Speaker 3:          00:13:26       That's of, and that was, I never even really did. I talked about it on stage a few times, but yeah, I heard the, the audio, you talked about the time that you and I did it where I thought you were going to die, but every fucking show, like it was like my closing bit for here. It was a, there was one of the weirdest psychedelics situations for the folks at home. Uh, Doug and I were doing the man show and it was like in the death throes, right? It wasn't right. Yeah. Here we had to spend all night writing, trying to save the fucking thing. We knew it was a disaster. We got fucked. I mean, look, we, we both appreciate the fact that everybody was disappointed by how that show came out, but no one was more disappointed. And we were, the whole thing was a mess.

Speaker 3:          00:14:06       And look, we don't need to get into details, but uh, if you, unless you want to, no, no, no. It's, yeah, it's over. Was terrible show. But there was some great shit in it. I defy anybody to watch the uh, my midget sketch. You what is it? Another man's midget cause your, your sketch a defy anybody to watch that and tell me that's not hilarious. Where are you trying to steal the old mentioned from the man show. Bring them over to the middle. Knew we had shared with us, I mean it was a, it was the wrong thing at the time because our show is not a, the learning experience was priceless cause that was my first real television and just knowing how they fuck it up. We could have, we could have done something on the Internet, we've could have done something like Internet style where there was no input whatsoever and we could have had a great fucking time.

Speaker 3:          00:14:49       Right. And when, when they came to me with the idea, the idea was we're going to have nudity, we'll blur it out immediately. I'm thinking Joey d is going to be naked at the beginning of every show is just telling someone about that. And then the, and then I said on what? About squares? And they said he could bleep it out, bleep out, talk about whatever you want. They go, it's a good thing if we get sued, this is what stone Stanley guys tell me. If we get sued, it's a good thing. Yeah. I'm like, we are gonna fuck shit up. I'm like, I'm just can't wait for abortion monologues in chaos. And when we got in there, it was totally different story. As soon as we got in and the audience wouldn't have liked it any better. No, they would've still hated it, but we wouldn't have had the fuck.

Speaker 3:          00:15:26       We would've had the bags on our heads. We would've had to rebuild and make a new audience. You know, there was one point in time with John Stewart didn't use to host the daily show. Right. You know, people forgot there was that other guy and it really, we shouldn't have called the dementia. We should've said, we are really into the idea of taking over that time slot or that idea that doing this new show. What? It told us to pound sand probably go fuck ourselves. Yeah. Yeah, they were, they were convinced that that name was going to sell everything and that was going to be the big push and there's name brand. I'm like, it's it, but it's not the same. Sheldon at the same guys, they're not here anymore. None of the writers are here. What the fuck you talking about? Can you do it?

Speaker 3:          00:15:59       Fear, fear factor, 14 hours a day. That was, I got so greedy. I was like, I am going to have two shows at the same time and I was just thinking this stuff up, that money I could never work again. Never work in again. I'm never working again, but that was a dumb I down. Terrible idea. You should never do more than one television. If you didn't have to work would you stop? No, not stop doing. Stand up and maybe, yeah. I like doing the UFC too, man. It's nothing I do right now is really work. You know, between Standup, I mean, I can or I can regulate how many times a year I'd go out and the UFC. I, I look forward to it. It's fun. It's like, yeah, what am I going to do this weekend? I could stay at home and I can go to the movies or I find it Indianapolis. I want some dudes beat the fuck out of each other from five feet away and I get paid for it. I get to call. It does, it never feels like work, but if it was like a sitcom or something like that, yeah. Do you got to shut it off for a, did you get, did you guys want to hear that? Uh, yes. Yes. Yeah. And then what's, let's reintroduce this. Okay. I, this is, so this is Jesse Ventura and opion Anthony, Jim Norton and him get into an argument. Right?

Speaker 4:          00:17:02       Okay. I'll talk to y'all. [inaudible] can you hear that? Yes. Okay. Cheryl, that yes, bodies identified. Ah, well we'll just fly with that. What the hell? My government told me that. So you know why I don't believe my governor. You believe Saudi Arabia's go go over there flying planes around. But here's why I don't believe my government, my government is lying to me so many times they lied to me about the Gulf of Tonkin incident. Isn't that pretty important? Be like, I want to go back that far. You want to go back to far with the Kennedy? We can't go back to avoid via dog. You said to me, we were with those, got all the shopping in 2004 pounds. So we're not going back that far. We said we send our guys off to war without giving a shit. And I'll tell her that's not true. I agree with you.

Speaker 4:          00:17:51       When did you go to war? I've never been in the door and that door. So you don't know. But I say pull them out of everything. So because I've never been in the military when we are attacked by I feel a nation, we should not, it should be proven first. I feel we proved that. You feel we didn't. Do you also feel that fucking Bush was behind nine 11 so we're always going to disagree. Go put fucking words in my mouth. You feel that the u s government was behind it and I didn't say that. Josh. I met covering it out where you have not been told the truth. So you feel like, well, okay, wait a minute. All right. If you'll call them down in a moment, you're yelling. You said the ads, right? When you're the governor, they slot

Speaker 4:          00:18:31       bring you up to yours. You know, wish I saw that you said about, you know you're not going to let me talk. I'm out the door and talking. The whole time while you're doing is yelling for people and you don't want to address point by point. You Act like we say, send our boys to our fucking, we've never said that I agree with you, but I want to pull them out of Jeremy. I want to pull them everywhere. The U s military should never be dying for other countries. I don't care for Roya happened. Scan them. Outcome. I don't care if Kim Jong Il bikes itself. That's not my business. I just think that if we were attacked, we have the right to honor military to respond. So that's not something warmonger saying fuck the voice. Send them over.

Speaker 4:          00:19:11       That's what I want to see. It just sits and looks at Jimmy. Why Awkward? That was a fair point I just made you were wrong when you said that. I don't know. I didn't listen. I talked over you. Yes. Nutritional yelling at me cause I'm not talking. I'm not yelling at you. I'm just telling you about your point. You would shoot. It does. It's something. So let's say that you guys are just full of Shit. You're, you're warmongers. You know, it's like that's not the truth. Yeah. Yes, I stand corrected. Thank you. You're a great American web. How much have a great American, but I'm not a warm in their country calls. You're there. Hey, I've never been in the military. So you're brave. I'm a coward. I have no right week.

Speaker 1:          00:19:57       Let me stop there for a second. Stop there for a second. You know, if you ever listened to something and it was a long time ago and you have it in your head as being one thing and then watch it again and you go, wait a minute. Well I remember when they had the loose change guy on there and they fucking decimated them. But he's not a, he was not a performer. He's not integrative physician to those guys. The fucking, there's so many New York guys and I think Jimmy Norton is funny. He's a great guy. Off the cuff, probably the funniest comic. What I saw when I saw the video was I originally, I must've not seen it all. I must've saw just Jimmy shouting him down and he walked out of the room. I must not have seen the debate that went on to discussion that went on before it. I must not have, cause I remember that. I think I just remember him standing up the point we're about to get to. I don't remember that part at all. If you watch, I just watched

Speaker 5:          00:20:48       the most dangerous man in America. The Daniel Ellsberg story. What does that, it's a, he released the Pentagon papers. He was a top advisor to the Pentagon during Vietnam and knew that it was all bullshit from the Gulf of Tonkin. All this secret shit that we were doing and release the papers to the New York Times, uh, is, uh, Nixon called him the most dangerous man in America. It's, and it was like 20,000 pages of all the fucking lies that were told about Vietnam. And you watch that fucking movie, Jim Norton and tell me that they don't send people into fucking to die for no reason other than political.

Speaker 3:          00:21:28       Jim Norton is a good guy, but he's a Republican. He's got like this right wing lean to him. It's a lean, you know, he goes conservative and I think he does it because he gets support from them. And I think he likes it. And I liked the idea of it. And, and, and he's correct. Absolutely. Though a lot of people who are liberals who call themselves liberals are whiny constantly to shut the fuck up. Oh yeah. No, I think liberals fuck up more stuff. Way More in my day, in my, my, my own personal life. Yeah. You can't smoke in bars. That's not Republican. Yeah. You should be able to smoke wherever the fuck you want. If a bar decides they're going to stop smoking, and I understand it for the patrons that worked there, but you can find plenty of patrons at smoke and if they want, they want to quit while you know what?

Speaker 3:          00:22:09       They should quit the job and quit smoking. Okay. You can't be around smoke. Right. I totally understand your point, that it's bad for your health, but there's people that do smoke. It'd be more than willing to take those jobs. At the old days when I was playing pool, we all pool halls were smoking and I didn't mind. I liked it. There's something about it, man, and I'm just, I'm using that as a frivolous example, but it was the first one that came to my, but the, as far as the nanny state itself is concerned, that's mostly liberal policies. Yeah. He, so it's Norton's anti liberal and he's right. There's a lot of Cottey fucking throwing their cigarettes out of their Prius. How many fucking times have you seen that? I've seen that seven times. Yeah, it's cause it's so ironic. I always go a number five.

Speaker 3:          00:22:47       The fucking guy throws a cigarette out of his Prius the other day with a meat is murder bumper sticker. I want to just fucking grab him and pull his head off. Just just rip it right off his fucking week spine to shut the fuck up. So I understand where Norton is coming from. I understand this, this rebellion against, but it's, there's, there's absolute proof that the government has put people in harm's way. Absent proof. They're profiting off of relentless proof. Not just a few aberrations but relentless over a course of time repeatedly. And No, you don't know about it until long after the fact years. So yes. The fact that I, I would, if I had to bet money, I would say on some level nine 11 was an inside job on some level. But what they do is they take every possibility and combine them though as though they're all actual fact. They were not really planes. What we're seeing our drones, ladies and gentlemen, if you look at the bottom, you can see the box very clearly. I'm

Speaker 1:          00:23:46       looking at two pixels. One Gray, one's white. I don't know what the fuck it is at. All. I fear is like there's no parts of the plane that went into the Pentagon, but yet you look at a picture and be like, there's this big parts and say, well, you know, yeah, there's fucking broken wheels and shit. With that plane hit the Pentagon for sure. There's a video of it. He was living and people who like to do video, it was only like a play and I'm like, fuck, do you know it's one frame, things going 500 miles an hour and it slams into a building and explodes. And why do you think it's a missile? It can be anything I'd be at somebody's throwing a football, you know, it doesn't matter. Like there's little things like the fact that they show a lady hanging out the whole of the World Trade Center where the plane made a whole waving for help, but you're, and you're thinking just logically, okay, if it's hot enough to melt steel, how is that woman sitting there and address waving out the window?

Speaker 1:          00:24:34       How is she not on fire? So stuff like that. Yeah, that, yeah. Maybe there is a scientific explanation for that. Well that is disinformation is all about right. You say some absolutely ridiculous things like what people don't know, ladies and gentlemen, there were Ufo is stationed in New Jersey. They needed a distraction to get out of the state. They'll add shit like that to shit. That's real. And then will that get all up? That's what Jesse Ventura's show did for everything it was talking about by being overproduced and acting like he never right. Are you telling me that problem? Are we better get out? Go file. Wait, this is your TV show. You just walked in and you didn't know what it was going to be about. Well, you know, once you're on the set, what are you going to do if you're Anthony Bordain, you gotta eat the snails.

Speaker 1:          00:25:24       Hey you are you on for another nine 11 thing was the the amount of people on those planes cause you and I, we fucking fly for a living. And why you go there at like 30% capacity? Like how often do you get on a fucking plane where there's only a third full? Yeah, very rarely but all of her essay. So again, there's things that made me, you know, brought up buildings, seven questions, building seven's the big one tonight. Building seven's the one and I don't claim any knowledge. Okay. This is, people get all frantic when you start, you're questioning the fucking official story. So what are you a truther you wouldn't have fucking known living truther like you cannot be interesting to me. I don't give a fuck. I didn't, I don't know. I don't like New York.

Speaker 1:          00:26:10       I was in Irvine last night, fucking horrible spectrum center, this adult destination mall and I said around, as I said, a fucking nine 11 happened here. I don't think it would make national news. Maybe, maybe one local guy would write a letter to the editor complaining about how it ruined his reservations at pf Chang's. That's pretty funny. But yeah, I'm interested, but I don't, I don't care. It doesn't affect my day. Um, well I, I, I'm fascinated and I'm interested in, and I do care. I know, you know, all jokes aside, a lot of people died there and

Speaker 3:          00:26:43       people knew people who died there and you will die everywhere all the time. And it's crazy that you wear, we don't such an influx of knowledge right now that you can go online and find some shit that you should care about. And I had to fucking cut. Um, I, my list is full. You have to care about enough already the connections that were supposed to have the people that we don't know because they were born in Connecticut as opposed to people that we don't know that were born in Iran and not buying that. That's, that's where it gets ridiculous. It's like with the connection of information that we have with the Internet, at a certain point in time, they're not gonna be able to keep selling the whole idea of, of a, a planet or, or have a, an individual country or an individual state.

Speaker 3:          00:27:24       They're going to have to eventually just, we're, we're going to have to go to one, one CR, one world government. Yeah. I'd have to, you know, pro new world order in that sense. Yeah. We have to be the same thing. We can't be fighting over each other because you know, this guys are like a million people die in Iraq and ember goes, hey, as long as it doesn't happen over here, but it is that is over here, this over here, over there. It's the same thing. It's the people you don't know there were born somewhere else who fucking got jacked like yeah. And if we tore down borders, I could stop caring about people closer to me. Yeah. It's like you get trapped in that whole idea of, you know, this is my team, these are my people and you know, someone fucking plays a country music song.

Speaker 3:          00:28:01       And throws up a flag and I'm man, fuck it. It feels good. It feels good to be in right. All right. Feels good. God bless America feels good singing around with a bunch of other people and you're all drinking. Where are resilient people? How has that fucking baddest mother fuckers on the plant? Wu on July 4th I didn't blink after [inaudible] and you're drunk. And that's how people get recruited. That's how, that's what happens. You know, you shouldn't be great if, if generations didn't overlap, what do you mean to carry on the nonsense? That way if there was a great ever, if people like we just showed up now with all the, you know, the basic skills, motor skills, you know, instincts, but we still had the innocence and ignorance of a baby. Like one generation dies and then the next day the next generation starts. So they can't pass down ridiculous notions like nations.

Speaker 3:          00:28:52       And you ever stop and think when you see all this crazy shit and this is what I'm on lately. They ever stop and think about all this nonsense that keeps carrying on despite the access to information that we have. And you ever look at it and go, maybe this is like a natural pattern. You know, I've got this thing I've been tripping out on about, and like animals and natural instincts. I'm like, we look at like wolves and we see the Alpha, the Beta out of the pack. We know he'll likely die on his own. And we go, hey, you know, that's just, that's it. It's hard as fuck to be a wolf, you know? And they have to do that. That's natural. And we look at bees making beehives, that's all natural. But we never look at ourselves as the direction we're moving in his natural juice.

Speaker 3:          00:29:29       Maybe possibly super fucking incredibly complex, but ultimately natural. And this idea of, you know, that we have so much control and so much power over our future. Maybe that's a crock of Shit May, may be the reason why all this nonsense is in place is because that's like a little, almost a universal order to keep this process moving in the direction it's supposed to be moving in as what? I probably didn't get the word in edge wise, but with Alex Jones, he would say he was trying to make the point because I am a, you know, hugely against procreation and uh, he was a, well, you know how the fucking, if we don't keep making smart people than fucking dumb people, if you're going to have a fuck off, yes, she will always be out numbered. And eventually, yes, smart people don't have to exist. What if smart people stopped procreating?

Speaker 3:          00:30:21       Then you give the earth to the dumb and you don't fucking create poor bastards who have to suffer in it. I used to think until I had kids, I used to think that like procreation, like who gives a fuck? What are you gonna make another person? Does it matter? And then once I had kids, I started realizing, well, this can be fun. You can enjoy the shit out of this and he can make these little happy people and it makes your life more happy and it makes their life have you get a chance to make this little person a raise them happy. I don't claim to have any information about what the fuck is going to happen to the world and although our take your scent, your your similar cynical view that you know we're fucked. We're going on a certain road, overpopulation, the pollution of the environment.

Speaker 3:          00:31:01       Nobody seems to care the corporatization of these small countries and fucking rob them of the resources and pollute them and this and that and war and fucking chaos and where the fuck is it all going to go? I'm not completely convinced. I don't think I have the answer. I don't think I could have ever imagined that this could have taken place. If I was a monkey. I could never imagine that we'd be doing a fucking podcast right now, just sitting in my office just shooting the shit and it would spread through the Internet and you can do whatever the fuck you wanted and that this would be the kind of thing where you could reach people. I get emails from people from Australia, from fucking Tanzania. I get Italy, China. I get emails from all over the world. Somehow or another. This has had some of them say, you suck.

Speaker 3:          00:31:39       A lot of them do. I suck in China. Most of my emails honestly, are really positive. Every now and then I get some Umea. You a youtube douchey ma'am, but I like to think that it's always one guy too. There's this one guy, the only way Douche always. What my point was that I could never have imagined this taking place, so why am I pretending that I know how this is all going to turn out? Why am I pretending that I have a little fucking do man, it's coming. You know apocalypse too for sure. No, not necessarily, but that's when I stopped giving a fuck is when I realized I'm not going to procreate. So it doesn't matter. Duncan Trussell mind, fuck me last week and that was it. Monday, when do we do this? We've got Dunkin Monday, Monday. Dunkin mind fucked me on Monday by saying something like, how do we know how long we get to live for?

Speaker 3:          00:32:22       And he was talking about reincarnation. He was like, maybe we live forever. Maybe reincarnation is you live this life. And then you know, you think you're fucking going off a bridge and a truck and you know, you wake up from the dream, you're like, fuck, I almost died, but you did die and you're just in this new thing now. And this is life with embedded memories and embedded ideas and you keep going on and on. And there's times where I stopped back and I look at my past and I ma, I'm not convinced that was me. Look Dude, see these right here. These are all my, my martial arts metals, these are all from taekwondo tournament. When I won the US Open and a silver medal in the U S Cup, we had a problem. Please gentlemen, you know what to make me hard sign. Um, but anyway, I don't believe I run those.

Speaker 3:          00:33:08       I don't believe I really used to do that. I don't believe I know how to do it still. And I, I'll go out and I'll hit the bag and something or something like that and I go, oh, I guess I really know how to do that. Like somehow I know that's in my head, but I don't believe that that's really me. You know, that was, that was so many years ago. It's a different human being. Your fault. Every cell in your body is replaced every seven years. Yeah. You know what's weird about his, uh, in theory, by the way, I thought of it as a afterwards, unfortunately, but I understand what he's saying. Where you, you, you, you wake up and you're like, oh, you know, you might've just re born or whatever. Right. But you're still getting old the whole time. Doesn't matter. Doesn't matter.

Speaker 3:          00:33:42       He might be right. Be The memory of you getting old is this life. You don't know whether or not the memory of you getting old is just taken from another life or not. You have no idea. You have no idea how long you've been here. It's all nonsense. Every time you wake up, you're trusting that you're on the same track in the same game that you're, you know, on the, in the same fucking movie. And then the same. Yeah, there's the, every time you wake up, look, everybody's scared to die. But nobody is scared to go to sleep. And they ultimately seemed to be the same thing. I mean, chemically, they're even the same thing. Your brain produces DMT when you're in rem sleep and they believe it also produces it when you're about to die. And they think that's responsible for all these crazy near death experiences.

Speaker 3:          00:34:20       And you know, you've had the empty, you know what the fuck I'm talking about. If you didn't know that that existed and then someone was trying to describe it to you, they would do it. No justice, right? They'd be like, you could talk. You could talk all day. You can't now. Yeah. It's, you can't describe it is what you always say before you try and that shit's happening to you every night and you're going to die and that shit's going to happen when you die. We don't know. We don't know what the fuck we are. We don't. We do not know. This is real. You assume that it's real because I'm, I'm agreeing. It's real and your ingredients real and we're all in a room together, but this is all just trust. I'm just trusting that you guys were even fucking real. You know? I'm trusting that.

Speaker 3:          00:34:56       You know what I'm saying? I'm trusting that this this day that I woke up isn't some new life that I just started because I was some fucking trucker in Iceland and I went into a frozen lake. You know who the fuck knows? You're the only one they exist to. Couldn't be like everyone else is just like a part of your brain. That's the theory. There's a lot of people who subscribe to the theory that the reason why the world is ending is because your life is ending and your life is really the creator of this universe and this universe all exists in your mind and as you get closer to death, the world becomes more and more fucked up. Fascism and fucking government control and their chips in my brain. Really it's always old people that do that the most. Sure. It's not like

Speaker 1:          00:35:38       it was your, not like you were those old people by the way are in your mind. How about that? How about those old people aren't even real and the old people in your mind that are playing this fucking game out with you. Yeah, but uh, if you knew that, if you knew that was the case, it would fucking ruin your day. What it though? I would still enjoy the fuck out of it. I can still enjoy it. Like it's just a strange ride. Groundhog day though. He didn't enjoy that. Yeah, but that was different at the same fucking life over and over again. Brian's not talking about slightly different every time. Saying, if I, if I, if I consent that you are just part of my imagination and I'm creating you [inaudible] that would suck. Well, the real question is what the fuck? What a guy, what would wake up every day?

Speaker 1:          00:36:18       Go? What should I have Joe Rogan, dude, I made them up. And that's not just me. It's you. You're, you're living in your imagination. I would hope that I have a better imagination than why it's fucking fantastic list if I am, let me tell you something right now. If I am just a player in your imagination, I am honored at what you've created. Like fucking fly across the room. Oh No, no, no, no. Brian in the chest. No. I imagine like, no, you've done an amazing job with your imagination as a bit player in your imagination. I just want to tell you, thank you very much for everything you've created the pores. It's brilliant. It's brilliant. It's brilliant making you blow smoke up my ass. You, you're right. You are the master. You're the man behind the curtain. Don't even know what I'd have you say if you were in my imagination.

Speaker 1:          00:37:04       Listen, you've done an amazing job what you've done in Afghanistan, the quagmire. You know what I really love? I really love the drug war references that you throw into it. The fact that we're over there in Afghanistan and they produces 90% of the world's opium. I love how you may be my imagination. Not only would you be heaving compliments upon me, but you'd you'd give me Vaginas to in a can to fuck fucking Dick. I want to thank you for the pouty lips stuff. Yeah, man. I love those. My space pictures that you created. I love how you made Justin Bieber. Justin Bieber's brilliant brains, right? When you think it's over right? When you think it's over. Well, there's no begin to be no more, no more, no more. Boom. A new one. More ridiculous than ever before. He's a fucking I. I don't know why. I know I have to know who that guy is.

Speaker 1:          00:37:50       I don't watch any shows like that. I don't even listen to music, but I know who Justin Bieber's I don't watch gossip fucking shit. It's yeah, it's something you could bury me in the ground under eight feet of fucking soil and leave me there like a fucking David Blaine trick and I would still somehow find out who Justin Bieber is and not know why. I don't know why either. I haven't even heard his voice. I don't need not even know what his voice sounds pointing. Get Yogurt with him. I don't know what he looks like. I just know the name and he's a big pop sensation. N N. Dot com I go to for my mainstream news. Okay. I go there and there's an article, Kim Kardashian upset about playboy pictures. She's upset because some pictures when she posed for playboy in 19 seven got released and somehow they're on the internet.

Speaker 1:          00:38:38       That's like tiger woods getting pissed off because they showed a fucking old golf game. Right. You know, like what the fuck are you talking about? This is like real news. How do I know about this? I can't stop breathing. I want to know the details. What happened? Oh, well the guy who did the playboy shoot, he had a bunch of images that are unreleased and finally he released them. That mother Fucker, especially since you can get pissed after you've had that, that porn video either that porn video was like one of the dirtiest porn videos I've ever seen. Big fucking throbbing. Black big. Okay. Big Black Dick. Confident young black man who is handsome and athletic and she was sucking his hard black Dick. That's a wrap. You can't complain about anything. You crazy bitch. You made it, but I don't know why I know her.

Speaker 1:          00:39:23       I mean [inaudible] you know her because she wants you to know her and I fucking hate it. I brilliant out of my head. I do hate it, but I don't. I love it. I love it. I love the retardation of it all. I mean we, yeah, we would be out of business. I didn't have everything in the world to hate. We would be puking, but we wouldn't be funny. We wouldn't be funny if we didn't. We'd have little name tags on right now. We'd have to have our hair cut over our color. If I didn't know who fucking Kim Kardashian was. I don't agree with the whole Buddhist monk ideology of living wearing robes. No masturbation, no fun. Because then you miss out on some of the fun of hating. You miss out on some of the fun. There's like an a part of me that knows that this is the wrong path and lightened meant when I start shitting on people and fucking torture them.

Speaker 1:          00:40:09       But there's another part that goes, fuck you. Stupid. Fuck. I'm trying to figure out the way the Internet is. It's only a matter of time and it's actually going on now before the just regular civilians are open to the same kind of fucking hate mail. Yes. Internet trash talking that we deal with on a regular basis where you know, you go out to lunch on a date with some woman and she goes, Huh? He had puts on her Facebook. He had stinky breath and he's fat and I was boring. And she links to your Facebook. Well, no, the guy's going to have someone from fucking four Chan finds it and then they start a thread on animal and it's fucked. Paul Revolution, he w n e, d, You know, emailed this guy, you, you're fucking constellations, but you're going to find out what people really think about you and you're not going to like it.

Speaker 1:          00:40:58       And it's like change what we take for granted as just being honest versus being civil and people are really gonna have to start just Larkin owning who they are. I, yeah, I agree. And I think another thing that's going to happen is that this is only one stage and an endless stage of disclosure. And then what we're at right now is the beginnings of transparency between all people and all information of all, all acts, everything you've ever done and everything you've ever thought, right? We're eventually going to be able to like literally sink up to one fucking hive mind that going to happen. Google. Yeah. It might be Google, right? Google might be skynet. Yup. Well whatever know it's, it's, it's

Speaker 3:          00:41:34       inevitable. I mean everybody wants to again, make me hard, ladies and gentlemen is signed. The keeps falling for the folks that are on iTunes that don't get to see this. When Doug and I were on the Mankato, I know we complained, but this is, this is pure evidence that was, that was the best story about how hard we had a game show that we created called make me hard. And it was, it was one of the best things we did when it actually turned out. And the reason why I was one of the best things we ever did is because there was tranny cock cock. Yeah. But we, we the the show is called make me hard. And then when we actually made the show and when we, you know, talk to the comedy central people and everything, they didn't like hard, hard was too dangerous.

Speaker 3:          00:42:15       They wanted it to be make me stiff. And we were like what the fuck is the difference is the most, this was right before we're about to tape too. So our department has to rush that. They allowed fucking full open tranny cock open tranny cock cause we're going to blur it out. Simulated fellatio on a banana by images. This is what happened. All the language. It's just this was the Gig. There was a kid, they would strap him to a chair and they would put it, this harness, actually I should back up because a lot of people probably don't remember, make me laugh, was a game show where people tried not to laugh while comics try to make, but the guys would get in their face and say silly things. So make me hard. We set them up where they have this box on their package and we would decide when it lit up indicating that they had an erection.

Speaker 3:          00:43:00       So we had, so they had to try to not get a boner during these sexual, uh, yeah. So of course it would go off, midgets would eat bananas. It would go off. And we had this really hot tranny. She was so hot that Eddie Bravo and I were at the comedy store one night and we were coming down that we've got a park at the high end. The comedy store parking lot was full and we're coming down the ramp, but she was coming up at eight. He's going, God damn that pitches on. Look, this chick coming up right now. Whoa. She's so pretty. I go, that's a dude. I've seen his dick. That's how hot like her name is. Vanity and choose totally believable. If you ever think that you can't get tricked by a tranny, there's no way I would know. I wouldn't know. You wouldn't care.

Speaker 3:          00:43:41       She, yeah, she blew a dude. We know and yeah, just did it because Weiss, yeah, twice, once on the set. And then once that, and then she called him after she was at our hotel and he was back the next day or something. He's so hot. We're calling him, her name was vanity. And you can find her like, I think it's vanity, Tsu, Google. I've found her to show it to people who'd, who'd blame him? So anyway, the, we, the, the guys, you know, strapped to this table and she climbs all over him and he licked her tits. Right. I can't remember. Poor fucking guy. We tortured this guy's memory forever. So He's, he's like, everyone's going, yeah, yeah, yeah. People cheering. And then she pulls out this trainee Dick that looks like, like a poison monkey. Dick look like it looks sick. Like it had been hitting so many female hormones. It was like an old man

Speaker 1:          00:44:32       in a wheelchair. That's what a tickler. And she pulled it out. It was black, it was black. As it functions, there's a bunch of snow. No, it's done. It's all done. I mean it's just hanging out there. It probably feels good when you suck. It's still, you know, even a soft dick feels good if you suck it right. But I don't think, I don't think there's any, unless she pops Viagara maybe she'll talk for Agora and I still have a hard dick. Wow. But she's just so full of female hormones where he is.

Speaker 6:          00:44:56       Do you know if it's something that's kind of crazy and I, I, before, I shouldn't have ever said this, but now I think I can do it. Uh, I used to read, start reading penthouse magazine reading recently and there was this thing at the end of the magazine that said, I'm coming next month, pet pet of the month. Uh, and then there was this girl's photo and stuff like that. So I became friends with her on Twitter just to follow her around. And see who this girl is. And then the following month she wasn't to the pet of the month. And then so then I started following her Twitter a little bit more. And she's a guy

Speaker 1:          00:45:26       what? And they just kind of kind of like, hmm. They just swept it under the rug. So a dude snuck in and became a penthouse pet ivy league. They obviously did a photo shoot because it was saying next dude's name. I don't remember man. It was like it was, you got to come was like, where's Alex Jones on this? Well I can tell you what months it was. It was like, how about this? How about you Google that shit? Find out what? I don't think it's no one caught it, I think. I think I just noticed it because I followed her on Twitter. Why do you think she's a dude? Because she's a dude, if I know. Cause you sucked his neck. If you look at the, if you looked at her and then, and then she talks about it. She was talking about it on her Twitter for talking about being a dude.

Speaker 1:          00:46:06       Yeah. And then she heard Twitter just went away. Whoa. They paid her off. I think I paid her, I don't know, older. She's fucking, imagine if you were seeing drivers allegedly, let's just say you're a truck driver and Cincinnati and you beat off to the fucking July edition of penthouse and you find out what's up, dude. He probably got a good lawsuit some fucking like it was like, well, [inaudible] tell. I just want to know why they didn't notice that. It may be, how can you tell maybe she has a disease maybe or something. Maybe she has a disease. What the fuck does that mean? Brung it something bad. Dub World. The whole world. The fucking sex world. That's a strange world. Yeah. Yeah. It's pretty fucking, I don't hate to use the word shallow. Yeah, but yeah, it's the, using the word gives a different connotation than what I mean, but they're really, there's not, it's like sex itself.

Speaker 1:          00:46:59       There's not a lot of ways to go with it. Right. All right. I stuck my Dick and I can. All right. Is that different? Does not. So the people that are involved in that tend to be people who are easily amused. Yeah. What I always said about like there was a bunch of friends who uh, they took me to this marijuana policy project thing at the playboy mansion and they were all going off. Wow. I'll call to the man. She know HEFCE the fucking man. Look what Hef did. Look would have dad and I and I stopped about I go, do you guys, there's a big difference between being attracted to girls like you are right now. You guys are attracted to girls. There's a giant difference between that and making a living, taking pictures of them naked so guys can beat off. And that's the whole world you live in and you have a mansion and you pay them to hang out with you because you think that it's a cool image.

Speaker 1:          00:47:48       So you have all these girls that you're on, you have the payroll and you're this old dude. Like you're the fucking man. One of my favorites bucket bits. You ever did? But yeah, that was bad that day. Just something fucking creepy about that. This creepy about anybody that's, that's getting money off of other people being naked and they're rich and the people who are to pour, right? Like that's, that's that, and again, it's all it is, is fucking nudity and fucking, yeah, it's like playing a Kazoo. There's only so many fucking, you can put a little bunch of Kazoos together and make it, cause you orchids is just, that is true music at the end of the day. But that is true. But if you're a young, raging man with a fucking throbbing Boehner and, and a strong sex drive in your, you know, 19 or 20, you know, 1920 and you're hanging out in Vegas and you're at a club money in your bank in new checks every night, that's exciting.

Speaker 1:          00:48:41       Right? No, it is. It is, but it's, it's, that is a market that's been created by the falls and morality and people that are against sex and make it as difficult thing to obtain. Right. If people were just fuck right away and get that out of your system, you could like Europe, like I don't, I don't know. There was there more liberal. But yeah, again, you don't see when you go to Europe, you don't see the shit we have here fucking sex in advertising and titties on a billboard because it's not built up to be that big a deal. It's such, you know, such a a, what's the word? Fucking holy grail. Just to see entities so they don't, it doesn't have the leverage over there that it does here. Remember we both grew up in Massachusetts and a lot of Catholics and Massachusetts, Catholic school girls.

Speaker 1:          00:49:31       I mean it's a fucking, it's a joke. It's a longstanding joke. Why are Catholic school girls whores? I mean not horse. Cause why are they freaks? Why they freaks? They're freaks. Because that's the last thing their parents want. Right? That's the last thing. The parents want to control them. The fucking teacher wants control. They make them wear crazy outfits and then also on those outfits become hot. You want to fuck them cause they're wearing those outfits. I mean, is that the most ironic shimmer leaders, Catholic school girls and fucking that, that outfit. Schoolgirl outfit. That's the outfit. Like all the guys. And you're like watching football on Thanksgiving and like, yeah, I'd watch it judge for the cheerleaders. Like you're from a such a repressed sexual place that just a girl that's vaguely skippy growing up in the Oh death I believe. Do you watch mad men? I'm fucking absolutely awesome. I it's, it's fantastic. It really, if you, if you look at it, it is a glorified soap opera. But that era

Speaker 3:          00:50:28       is so well done. I'm not totally familiar with the show. I've only seen like little clips out advertising from the 1940s fifties late fifties, early sixties. Here's what I know about that show. There's a bread head on that's ridiculously hot. Yeah, she's pretty hot. She got, she got fat this year. It's a big to do and oh, she's gotten, she's gotten wider in the Lazy Lazy. It became some big to do where uh, yeah, cause people have pointed out that she got fat and then there's the other, how dare you say she's fat than season one money. Like you wouldn't be happy to be with her, but the why, why can't she get fat and professional? Hot chick up bad. She's just up saved. She's fat. Fat is only fat as a description. You decide it's an insult. It's a description. Totally true. Indian, your indigenous. It's a description. You're fucking tall.

Speaker 3:          00:51:24       You're short. You're pat. I used to have a joke about Mexicans. It wasn't about Mexicans, but it was about the Roswell incident where you know the, the aliens, you remember that junk was, no, I don't remember the joke, but the joke was, um, you put Roswell, it's going to be a Mexican joke. I'm already kind of get, the joke was that the government released, Eh, they, they had a press release to say that they had a crashed Ufo and alien bodies. The alien bodies is bullshit. I did it just to make the joke better. And then, then the next day they say, they came out and say, Oh, we made a mistake. It was just blown. And I say, what about the aliens? Those were Mexicans. They were on a blown, they were tracking some shenanigans took place. I said that in one night at the comedy store and this chick yell out, Hey, yeah, like describing Mexican as a Mexican.

Speaker 3:          00:52:10       Like, it's a bet. Like I said, anything wrong with Mexicans. I've never had a anti race joke in my entire life, but any race. So to think that I would do it about Mexicans, but just that I said Mexico, it was like she had a right to stand up, hands on hips, long nails stretched out. Hey, like she found a fucking, she found an opening. I had to stop. I stop my show and address the issue. Oh, I still don't know you as something you're not supposed to say. My friend Brian wants got mad at me now. This Brian, Brian Frazier or writer, uh, there was something happened and uh, I said I was trying to chew you down and he's Jewish and he was super, super sensitive and he got really mad at me and he was right. I mean, I'm a, it was kind of a racist statement, but, oh, but, but you didn't cook.

Speaker 3:          00:52:58       I'm Italian. And if you said, oh, look at this fucking dopey Guinea, you know, with this gold chain and this stupid slicked hair, I started laughing, you know, it's not me. Okay. It's, it's, yeah. What are you acting like a Guinea? You know, if I, if I had a chain on it, he was like, what are you going, who are you acting like Guinea? I wouldn't be upset, but Jew you down, like someone tried to shoot you down. That's a particularly insulting side of a demeaning expression about Jewish people. And he got that day. They tried to mark drifty. Yeah, they're a little bit frugal. No fiscally responsible. Again, it's a self imposed. Oh Shit. I'm going to be, he got so mad once this fucking guy, this it. Brian was a, he's a really funny guy. He was a great comic, but a really high strung guy and um, uh, it's stopped doing comedy.

Speaker 3:          00:53:40       I think he just writes now. But we were in a, we had a cake together in Fremont and by the way, he was a bodybuilder at the time and all natural but enormous, like the proof positive that you don't have to do steroids to get big because I know this guy never did anything. He was eating like Broccoli and never even took vitamins. But he just was obsessed and at giant muscles to the point where I tell him like, you can't go on stage with teachers on like you go on stage with tee shirts, just carrying the fuck out of people. You don't look funny. You know, like funny. I go, you didn't need to wear like a suit or along a baggy shirt that covers you up. You're intimidating. I, I can't look at anything but you on stage with these giant muscles. So we did this gig together on the road and uh, he had a throat, sore throat and he was apologizing for the sore throat.

Speaker 3:          00:54:19       You know, he's like, I'm sorry to the, to the guy who ran the club. And um, he, uh, he goes, I'm sorry I was a bit sick all week, guys, go please. You were hilarious. He killed it was great. You guys were awesome. And, um, he goes, I'm just sorry. I just really, I wish I could've done a better job. He was really just a nice guy and the guy goes, relax with like a playing, what are you Jewish? He says this because Brian had a crew cut and he has blonde hair. But yes, he's Jewish. His fucking name is Brian Frazier. Like Frazier's that Jewish name. Like you wouldn't even put that together. But then you think Joe Frazier chooses a Jewish name is German. All right, well I have no idea. I wouldn't, I wouldn't see Frazier and Phil, your heap.

Speaker 3:          00:55:03       I say Fraiser's a German name. No, isn't that Jenny? No, I don't know the whole, it's not Liebowitz. It's not obvious, but I mean the guy, look, he's blonde, he's blonde and he does not look Jewish. Right? And he's a bodybuilder. He looks like he looks like some dude you pulled out of a farm in Iowa and he's ready to fucking kick your ass and date rape your sister. Right? That's what he looks like. But he's a nice guy. Brock Lesner is what you're saying. Exactly. You can't say so he goes fucking nuts and he can't talk cause it's flushes your fucking ass. All Jewish and he's red in the face and this guy can't realize that. He's telling me he's being serious for like the first couple of seconds. I'm like, fuck, what am I going to do here? I'm like, what am I gonna fight my friend to keep them from killing this asshole?

Speaker 3:          00:55:46       I'm like, I'm here in Vermont. I'm thinking I'm going to go to jail. I'm ready to this hall. And Brian is just big giant tree trunk neck. No, fuck that. Gosh, I have Josh any serious. And the guy has to realize that he's serious. And Brian is like leaning over the desk like screaming and the guy's face. And I'm like, so what happened? I have to talk him down and nothing happens. It's fucking anticlimactic story. Of course. He's Joyce. She was very upset about being called Jewish. Yeah, but they don't. But with the insinuating the Jewish, well, he was Jewish. People Complain, they just complain a lot. They're never going to really do anything. Right. Why are you, why? Why you have such a sense of guilt, right? What are you Jewish? I'm sorry, I got that from every fucking Jewish comic I've ever heard. That's why I say that. I'm sorry. Yeah, there's a lot of guilt going on in the Jewish world. Again, if you, Ari Shaffir as the best story about being, you know, Ari was raised like, like really strict orthodox Jewish and he had to read the, Tom would like 10 hours a day. He lived in Israel, like he did the whole deal and he said that they told him that masturbating, when you masturbate your seed, when it leaves your body goes into a demon's womb and gives birth to handicap babies.

Speaker 3:          00:57:04       Which is true. Absolutely true. True. Could you fucking imagine if somebody that's, that's what your mom was telling you and you're like, oh my God, I know this can't be real, but I got to go with it. This crazy bitch. I'm never going to figure it out. Like walking through the mall and apologizing to people in wheelchairs. And when I was in first grade, I went to Catholic school and I can very remember very clearly thinking that I'm fucked because I know I don't know what life is all about, but I know these assholes don't either. And they're the ones who are going to tell me they're the ones going to tell me and I'm fucked. I'm fucked. Because they're not telling the truth and they're not right and I'm fucked. I remembered that, that thought. I really remember it from being like six. That's a terrible fucking feeling for a kid to think that the, the people that are, that are raising you are retarded. No, wait, what's going on? I'm going to jerk off into a g a demons pussy and it's gonna make a retard baby. Really? Really? Yeah. You gotta fucking video of this, you know, could you just, why are you just saying this? You just, you know, because it was written somewhere and you're gonna, you're gonna teach me and I'm five. You fuck.

Speaker 1:          00:58:05       I always, I, I, I was, no, that was, sorry. That was someone else has just talking to no, I thought it was just telling him this. He was that stupid meeting I had with that lawyer guy. But uh, yeah, I would, yeah. Doug's Stan hopes lawyered up. Ladies and gentlemen, I am lawyered up. Look in high power. Don't get crazy. The guy showed me that he had a, an autograft sheet of acid from Timothy leary. That's a good lawyer. Said when that's on your lawyer is warm. I might go to jail too. He's going to jail first. I'm sure it's not going to jail acid. Did you want to jail first and you have to wait with the artwork before you write the book. You have to wait five years. Right. So that's the court ordered notice off it off of it for five years after he goes to jail.

Speaker 1:          00:58:50       I ain't a fucking great joke that uh, uh, there's a statute of limitations. Like there's 13 more months before I could do it. Really? Yeah, I'll tell you off the air. Wow. Awesome. One of the fucking coolest things about being friends with Doug Stanhope. I get to know the joke. You bitches don't get to know shit. It's weird having material that you can't do for 13 months. While you should know what you should do. How strong is this story? How strong is the story? While the story itself is, is, is strong, but I'll, this is what I think. There's one joke, we'll the story itself, I think this is what we should do. Actually. I'm actually doing the joke. I just had to change it around a little bit. Oh, you know, it'd be cool though is if you had a show where you organize a show, let's say in Phoenix, Denver, whatever, and pick a city and then told everybody online and 14 miles or 13 months, two weeks, I'll be [inaudible].

Speaker 1:          00:59:42       I do it on the fucking road. If it were a decade ago, subject was mother, mother. Okay. Oh, you know, you know, oh, the mother does something to you perhaps could be legally responsible for something along those lines. Let's just start. You're talking about, I'm talking about mother, mother. We had that wrong hand, but that's all we needed. Yeah. We had a, our moms on the demand show for that. Yeah. It was cool. It was really fun. Oh yeah. But uh, I realized that my mom was not nearly as crazy as your mom. Your mom. Mom's way more fun. My mom was boring bread and your mom, your mom's hilarious. You're your mom used to review porn. Dude, we had gotten about Doug's mom reviews porn was the best bit that we did. She was so terrified about that. She moved to La to be an actress and she did all these independent films for no money and stuff, but when it came to working with me, she didn't even want me there.

Speaker 1:          01:00:39       She was so nervous about me being there and me thinking she was funny. She was great. She was great. Your mom was hilarious and the whole idea, just a beautiful thing. It's like you have this new vehicle for writing comedy. You can write through your mom and your mom was going to do it and these sketches and it's fucking great. Really. I mean, the move would be honestly to just have only, you know only right for your mom. Everything. Well, no. She tried to do standup comedy and it was one of the most terrifying, awful. That's when I met you. I think she had been on stage at the night. I met you at [inaudible], didn't we? It was called union. It was next door to double. Oh, right, right, right. Yeah, you're right. My brother had gone up to do open mic and it was so awful.

Speaker 1:          01:01:20       It was like the worst fucking comedy you've ever seen and everyone knows me and I think you were there. Kinda remember it now it's one of those things where you just, you just, how'd you guys meet? Were you, what were you doing at the time when you go with this bar next to Dublin's? It was, I'd heard about him. I'd heard about them from a Joe Diaz, which I use radio. Doug Stanhope so funny motherfucker. You got to meet. That kid is good. We, I think he was. Yeah, that's what, that's what Joey said. He's one of us. Yeah. Where it was the real deal. Where's Joey Hollywood was the last time you saw him? I haven't seen him for years. I tried to bring him tonight. Yeah, I gotta get his number. I lost all of fucking when I lost my phone. What the Fuck Doug Stanhope not on, I lose my phone. I twittered my phone number accidentally send. The guy saw that somewhere. It's trying to send us a Doug Benson. Doug Benson was going to the Vegas for a UFC and I was like, yeah, here's my number, get in touch with me and get there. Fuck. And I realized once I sent it out that I sent it out to the whole world, or at least a hundred thousand people. How's that? So I got how many calls did you get? My phone, my phone. I would turn it on and it would have so many texts that detects would be coming in

Speaker 7:          01:02:27       being, yeah,

Speaker 1:          01:02:29       every time I would vibrate with the new texts it would get to a certain point where it's like a hundred hundred 50 and 200 and where the phone would just bang shut off and reboot. Wow. Blue Black. Where he would go black and it would reboot [inaudible] they don't have any. My girlfriend was on my Facebook and it accidentally when like online's so it shows that you're online to all your Facebook people end up fucking chat. Things just start popping up. So as I got fucking shut this off, I don't have that set up like that, I don't think. No, you just have to turn it on yours. Yeah, she had it. She accidentally turned it on somehow. I don't mind Twitter and stuff like that, but you can't let everybody looks like when we had the chat online with the, uh, the, the podcast, it was just too much.

Speaker 1:          01:03:11       Too much access. Right. So much freedom is fucking anonymous. Clouds, broken bottles up there, asshole. Just smashing keyboards. Fuck, fuck. You know too many of them man. Just too many. That's why I also get into with the mother thing go the like I would, I used to be able to tell jokes. Yeah, I'll take one. Definitely. I'd be able to talk about shit like that on the road 10 years ago because they didn't have the fucking youtube. Everyone with a cell phone camera. What you do is you, I won't tell those stories on stage because there's one of you little fucking rat fucks thinks out there that's got to youtube it and then you then put it whatever it is. I fucked around on my girlfriend last night. I would fuck around our girlfriends all the time. And if it was a funny story, I would tell it on stage the next night cause they don't know my fucking girlfriend.

Speaker 1:          01:04:06       Right. But now you can, I'm in Pittsburgh does this, who's, who are they going to tell? But now, yeah, it's every fucking show has some little fucking bitch that as proof to pry and pointed this out. And I've been saying it on stage at bootlegging is not even difficult anymore. The, I mean the expression comes from when you actually had to have a heavy equipment in your boot and it was very difficult to get. Now anyone can do it so you're not fucking cool for like good fucking tape of it. Yeah. I mean you were, you're, everyone's equipped for it. Every phone you buy has the ability to record videos for mine I have, yeah, I have one. That's the biggest piece of shit. I can't even really text on it because I can't figure out how to get a space. Okay. Texting me, hey, how's that? Yeah, it does. You're fucking $19. Why are you, why are you trying to avoid the future? Well, because I don't enjoy it. I don't like talking on the phone. I certainly, it's your fucking business of space right here in the lower right hand corner. Oh, the lower see the under case like you along stretched out. Yeah. Double wide do that. That's a space. W One f when it first met Doug,

Speaker 6:          01:05:18       one of the first videos I ever filmed ever was going to Ohio University and it was a parents' weekend and Doug, it was Ed Helms, Doug and the dude from a Chappelle show, the real world, uh, Christian Finnegan and fitting in. And so they, they think it's a, they advertise it as that clean, they accidentally put it on a family friendly events for parents weekend. So parents with their incoming freshman children. Right. And it was almost a riot and I filmed it from the back with the shittiest camera ever. And it's the worst video quality ever. But you could see people standing up screaming at him and Doug just went harder and harder. It's like, oh, let's do an abortion mentally. And it was like parents as Christ 600 walkouts. Yeah. Yeah. It was amazing.

Speaker 3:          01:06:06       That's awesome. I did a show and I miss those days like having a, having an audience that knows what they're there for. You miss out on all of channels. Old School Fun that people being mad at you. I did a a college in Olivette, Michigan and that was the same situation where they were told that I was clean somehow or another Barry Katz probably told him that cocksucker the booking agent. I get there, I go on stage, it's, I'm standing on two cafeteria tables in, in a, in a high school cafeteria. That's where the tiny little teeny speakers and it's a football college. They're all football players and just full of good food like right when I get onstage just yelling Faggot, fuck you fucking faggot. And so I just start lightened dudes up left and right and when I do this guy comes up to the, the corner of stage and the alerts me and lets you are not allowed to swear in this show. There's no swearing and I'm sitting here, these guys are screaming faggot at me.

Speaker 3:          01:07:04       I'm standing on two tables. And if you're pretending that these are real rules, that you have a structure, there's special words and are not allowed with your shitty fucking set up and this ridiculous. So I turned to the crown, I go, this motherfucker, you see this guy right here? He just told me, what do you guys, you guys are at least 18 right? You're old enough to die for your country. This guy doesn't think you should be allowed to hear swears. Do you believe this shit? This motherfucker right here told me that I can swear to believe this shit. And they started going crazy. I go, let's burn this fucking place to the ground to start throwing chairs and shit and go crazy and screaming. And I'm laughing and joking around while I'm saying, I ain't go no, don't burn to the ground. So the guy goes, just say whatever you, Amy is gay too, by the way.

Speaker 3:          01:07:49       So I don't want to make it seem like I'm adding a list for this guy's voice making the list existed. He goes, say whatever you want, don't be consequences later. Wow. That's what he said. Say whatever you want. I'm like, I'm going to do what the fuck I do. Signs you get paid. Yeah, I got paid and he had to pay me. Yeah, I didn't, I written didn't really get paid cause this was the days of New York entertainment were buried. But what Barry Katz used to do is he would book these colleges and you would get a check and the check would be to New York entertainment. You would give it to New York and attainment and then would cut you a cheque supposedly. Yeah. Theoretically. Well, Barry's expenses got a little out of hand. So he started spending people's checks and wasn't paying anybody. But I, I had done a college gig in yeah,

Speaker 5:          01:08:25       Tampa and then I banged the girl who booked it. So I went back for whatever reason, I don't know if it's in the same trip, but anyway, I s she had booked, it was backs. I was backstage and it was Darrell Hammond, think it was brewer. It was three guys from Saturday night live. And, uh, when they get off stage, they are like, so where do we go to get paid? And she goes, oh, uh, Barry said just send, I sent the check to him and they all fucking went, no, you fucking gave it to Barry. Get motherfucker now we're never going to see our money. This is, I did in the late mid to late nineties.

Speaker 3:          01:09:05       Barry Katz was one of the producers on the first last comic standing. I, he's not involved in it now. I don't know if he is, man think he is. Maybe [inaudible] name

Speaker 5:          01:09:14       famous manager. Yeah. Then at that Dane Cook, I think maybe

Speaker 3:          01:09:18       it was the first one where it was me. I was one of the judges, Monique and buddy. Oh that's right. Yeah. I forgot to buddy. I got mad at me cause I called aunt out on stealing, stealing shit from movies lines from the movie boiler room about Manhattan. Some guy comes up to a gay guy and he goes, hey, they should put your people on an island. And he goes, they did. It's called Manhattan.

Speaker 5:          01:09:40       It's funny, I have the actual pilot of the last comic standing. They had you in it. I have a copy of it. It is on you too. I have it somewhere on youtube. It's called Shit Funny House. I haven't seen it. Oh, I've pulled in my leg. I looked high and low for the more Jay more you and yeah, I did the presentation pilot for last comic standing and a presentation pilot is what they've filmed to show the network what the show would look like if uh, in order to get picked up. So I lived in a house for three days with five, there were five comics total and we were the comics. John Heflin was the only one that you'd know while there's Alex Stewart is a is a black comic. Yeah. All right. Him and it was really fun. [inaudible] I can't remember her name. And then some other chick that dates some comic.

Speaker 3:          01:10:36       So the only one that made it through to the heffer on one the second year.

Speaker 5:          01:10:40       Second year, yeah. Yeah. After the, after the first year. Because they were, they were acting like, well, if this gets picked up, you'll be on it. That's why my manager talked me into doing it. It was less money to do the presentation pilot than to be on the road. But my manager's like, well, you know, if it gets picked up, I mean it's already a presentation and then we're sitting in the house going, if this gets picked up, how are we going to act? Like we don't know each other. I'll coming into a house to live together. I go, I don't think we're going to be on it if it gets picked out. Fuck Jay. More fucking

Speaker 1:          01:11:14       cocky little concert. Norton Jim Norton was on the first season. Wasn't anybody had to like leave halfway through because, uh, I like to pretend comics that I, uh, I don't know cause I left Bisbee era to, to live in Bisbee, Arizona. So I don't know what's going on in comedy. So because I don't know what they're doing, I just assume they're washed up and it's a happy thought. And then I'll find out, oh fuck y'all get out arenas. I don't know. I don't watch network. He shot a fucking TV show. I thought that guy's washed up. Fuck yeah. There's a certain few guys. You root root to crash. Yeah. There's a certain few. When you find out they're not doing so good to you. Yeah, fucking prick. But you have to know it affects them. You know you're not a Boston comic. No, not at all.

Speaker 1:          01:12:01       Grew up in Wooster in Wooster. Tell us 18 as soon as I was old enough to leave, I put you on Boston comic. Whether you like it or not, there's a reason why there's so many fucking funny guys from that shitty part of the country and it's not shitty. Which shit is shitty. Yeah, the weather's Shitty. The girl, I think everything about, well, not everything obviously hyperbole, but I did not know the girls were nice until I moved to La. I didn't know they were capable of being nice fucking dumb as shit. We're hillbillies, man. Eddie Bravo's, Eddie, probably this girl. I met this girl in Boston and she, it was just a fucking Hail Mary. Sacrifice two in the morning, move way back in the day. Many, many decades ago. Anyway, she goes, why? While he's like making out with her and pulls his dick out, whatever, he goes, she goes, he can't tell you friends, girls in Boston.

Speaker 1:          01:12:52       I tell you fans. That's, that's what I remember growing up. I remember the only time I ever got to fuck with the girls were so sloppy, drunk and belligerent that it was like, we had to argue before we get to fuck. And then when we did it, when it was over, I was like, Oh, I've got gotta go home. Get me the fuck away from this. You better fucking call me. Call me. Like, there's still like that. It's the cold weather. Is it the fucking savages that lived there that came over on boats from Ireland? One of my first girlfriends when I was like 16, 17. Uh, I kept in touch with her, you know, remotely here and again. And I remember I had to be in my thirties going back and I call in, we will, yeah, we'll have a drink and hey, you look really good. And she goes, yeah. She goes, yeah, well maybe if you hadn't of Fuck Sherry Munson would still beat again. 17 years old. Oh, that's hilarious. Oh, oh, that's so fucking funny. But they do. They hold onto that shit forever. That's a fucking get out of jail free card. It's one of those few pat myself on the back times in my life is just comparing myself

Speaker 5:          01:14:12       to most of the people we grew up with and knowing that one night in my life would be something they wouldn't remember. That would be like the bucking biggest shit. I don't remember doing. I've done television shows that I don't remember. Wait, oh, you were on my show and I'm like, Eh, sounds familiar. If they were on the news once in the background, they'd have a still photo of it somewhere in their fucking grubby or can Foxborough framing fucking route nine route nine

Speaker 3:          01:14:47       the auto mall. Oh. Oh, that's so true. There's a, there's a feeling that I get when I go back to that part of the country. When I go to Framingham, I'll go to Natick. You know I mean the Natick Mall. When I drive through Newton, there's a feeling that I get lar. I escaped, got away from you. Fuck you. Fuck your trapped here. That's what I feel like in Ohio. Same thing, but I have to admit it's one of my favorite places to perform. They're fucking crazy and Boston and they don't give a shit. They want to hear the real shit. They want to hear the real shit. They had the best comp when, when? When I was coming up in the 1980s Boston had the best local headliners in the country. They were better. We've talked about this on the show many, many times. We talked about it when Dane was on, we talked about it when a bunch of different guys were on there.

Speaker 3:          01:15:36       They were the best comics in the country. There were local headliners. Don Gavin was the best comic in the country at one point in time, but no one knew it. He was the best, but I got to watch the guys at HBO. I got to watch guys when they came in town and did the live shows and I got to see Don Gavin. I'm like, he's the best. He's the best he's doing. He's squeaky clean and he's crushing, destroying the point where I feel like I'm going to quit. I'm a fucking fraud. What am I doing? I'll never be like this. And we got, we had, we were forced to, to see that like early on. You know Boston's a very strange place when it comes to comedy man. Yeah. It's, it's uh, it's fucking incest. It's an and says pond fucking Appalachian Mountain comedy. Y'All ain't welcome around here. It's a fucking town of red heads. We don't send none out. We don't accept none in, there's something about it though. It's a fun place. Cause cause of the fact that it's so cold there and it's so fucking miserable for five months out of the year, five nights out of the year you're like, what the fuck are we doing living here? When you walk from your car to your house, when you shut your car door, one

Speaker 5:          01:16:44       to the fucking house, cheat, grueling. And you get in your house, you're like, fuck, fuck, fuck. You shut the door and you stand there for a couple of sentences. Summers, you're fucking wet and full of mosquitoes. There's one day in fucking October where you kicked through some golden fucking dead leaves under your feet and it's that perfect crisp and you go, God, I see. I love the change of seasons. No you don't. No, don't you love that

Speaker 1:          01:17:10       fucking one day. And that's the only one you noticed and that there were other nice ones you had to work.

Speaker 3:          01:17:17       You kidding me? Oh, it's so true. So true. There's nothing worse than working a shit job in cold weather. Terrible. I didn't have to get up early to work a shit job. Did construction many, many years. My Dad was an architect, so like throughout high school when I wanted summer jobs, I got jobs on construction sites. But every now and then, you know, I would do something in the winter. And you know, when I graduated I did a lot of shit in the winter. You'd go to these fucking houses, they're framing a building. Look, somebody wants to their house built in January. They don't say no. They just built a house in January and you were in like 17 layers of pajamas under your fucking pants. You can't move like you're in a space suit and you're hammering nails. It's fucking zero out. Yeah. I never did that.

Speaker 3:          01:18:01       It's the worst. It was beautiful. It was the best thing I ever did. The smartest thing that I ever did when I was in high school, right when I graduated high school at the very year, me and my friend Jimmy Lawless, Jimmy got me a job in this construction site and Jimmy was like a carpenter's apprentice. He got me a job as a laborer and I carried cement bags and pressure treated lumber for two weeks. That's all I did for two weeks. Uh, carried cement bags and pressure treated lumber. We were building a wheelchair ramp at a knights of Columbus Hall. They needed a wheelchair ramp because some new laws and all I did was that all day. And I did nothing. I had nothing left. At the end of the day, I couldn't work out. I couldn't, I just ate. I couldn't work out, couldn't work out. Jesus. Not even in my company like that. Something that you want to do. After I was eating, that was back when I was fighting. I was 18 years old. I was fighting in tournaments. I had, I had to train, I had to work out, so I forced myself to work out and that taught me what?

Speaker 1:          01:18:57       All right. I was going to say, if you can't work, isn't that a workout? If you can't work out, it's not enough. You win your dudes. You're trying to kick you in the face. You've got to do other shit. You gotta. You gotta make sense.

Speaker 3:          01:19:08       Get in there with other dudes trying to kick you in the face. You get the timing down. You have to, you have to stay sharp. You can't just say, well, I don't need to work out. I'm carrying bags of cement.

Speaker 1:          01:19:16       Okay. All right. I would say I hear workout. That's you're lifting weights with the fucking sweatpants on. All right. Leg warmers. Yeah, but I, I learned, I learned, fuck, fuck. Hard work for no reason. Yeah, no, there's money in it. I mean, there is a reason, you know you're doing it so you can get that. Some people are predisposed to that, but, and again, I know that people that do that don't look at it like the hell. It's the same as people who come up to you and say, Oh man, that's the scariest thing in the world. What you do talk in front of people. I couldn't get up on that stage in front of people. Well, so scary. It's not scary to me or I wouldn't be doing it. Well it's, it's been, your job is scary to me. Fucking selling shoes for 30 years in the mall. Only to have the place fucking go out of business. Oh, selling crocs and a kiosk.

Speaker 1:          01:20:05       What do you do? I'm on the guy in the mall. I the beat dazzled iPhone covers. That's pretty good. I make about 60 grand a year. I'm doing good. Did you use to sell meat or is that Depaulo depaulo alright. Paul, one of you sold meat. Dorna Var and the Polo or the same group. Angry white guys from Boston. Well. Yeah. I said fucking white guy from my age, from Boston. You depaulo was one of the guys that I got a chance to see, uh, when I was coming up, when I was an open mic or he had a few years and he was like two, three years in. Who's already really good. He's one of those guys, Huh? When I, I went to see him at Caroline's, I guess it was maybe two years ago. I go, how the fuck is this guy? Not Gigantic. How is this guy not selling out arenas?

Speaker 1:          01:20:47       He was, but it was the, it was after Katrina and then he said, uh, he goes, a lot more people would've been rescued if it wasn't for the fucking misspellings. I looked at this, this roof, this guy was trying to get rescued off his roof. It's said hip on it. You want some hep trick that fucking won in front of you fucking howling. Howling. It's a late night show at Caroline's. And I'm like, how is this not an arena? I mean, I've known this guy for two decades. How was he? How was he not one of the most, you know, famous fucking comments. He is accessible. He's not just comics clown. He's accessible. He's got that angry Boston thing, man. It's just fucking, nothing funnier to me. I know some dudes probably, it's probably his fucking personality. People have to realize like, this is like the fucking thing.

Speaker 1:          01:21:34       Like, oh, like angry. And I'm like, you know what? Fuck man. You know, just live your life with that kind of hate. That's really bad for you. It's not real. Hates fun. Exactly. Yeah. It's, it's [inaudible] hepatitis qualify his personality. You have to understand this industry is run by people and most of them are fucking phony and they know they're fraudulent. And so a, a personality like Nick's is probably very scary to the people who would put him in an arena. Yes. And so I think it would, it's probably his personality is the reason because people are, that are afraid that they're going to be found out as completely. Yeah. They don't want to go like that around. Yeah. They don't want to fucking walking mirror. Nick played my brother on news radio. Oh, hell yeah. He uh, him and Brian Cowen and a Epstein from welcome back, Kotter brother on an episode of News Radio where we just beat the fuck out of each other.

Speaker 1:          01:22:28       Like people were, you know, like we were like someone, can we cut to a clip of that? Cause I have to piss desperate. I think that's why while, while, while, while Doug goes to p, Brian, do me a favor, before you pee, pull up Bobby Barnett. Pull up Doug's bit about Bobby Barnett because one of my fucking favorite all time bits is your bit about Bobby Barton. Just see the, that's what I was gonna talk about that. And she, she apparently now this woman from this bit that we're gonna play is a boy. If you go to Doug Stam help.com I'm sure in your archives you can tell your story. The story is fucking brilliant. The bit is fantastic. It's from uh,

Speaker 3:          01:23:06       keep the edge. Something to take the edge off. Something take the edge off, which is my favorite all time CD of yours. Not because of your materials the best cause it's, they're all pretty, in my opinion. They're all equal. They're all great. But I love the music behind it, man. I mean, I, that was my favorite CD to listen to. And you, and that CD you took on this sort of like a musical quality to your, your delivery too, like in sync with the, with, with the guitar. Henry Phillips and I used to do that in la just for stories where like know anytime I was a full story, I'd try to have him play with me, you know, goofy little clubs around and he was, he was, he was in Houston when I recorded that and I had recorded every night and wasn't happy with any of them.

Speaker 3:          01:23:49       And it's Sunday and there's only about 60 people. And I went, you know what? Fuck it. Why don't we just try it with the entire set, not just the stories. I, he had played with the blade to Bobby Barnett before and uh, you know, transvestite hooker or whatever. He'd played behind a few stories, storytelling. So I just, it was last minute like, all right, let's just, it's beautiful. The set feels like that too. It feels like a set where you had already gotten enough sets in the bag where you can be comfortable, you know when you record something or, yeah, it didn't give a fuck. Like tell people if I'm, if I'm filming something, one of my film and a film in the special, there's an eight and a 10 got a 10 out of 10 I'm going to be like, I gotta get this bit out.

Speaker 3:          01:24:27       I'm going to get that bit out and getting all technical once 10 minutes in, I'll be fine. Anyway, don't worry about the eight. If you've got a babysitter, 18 one one you can make, it'll be pretty, pretty close, but I'll sit in the words. But yeah, there's a looseness in when you know you already have it in the bag, but you can just go to like tomorrow night I'm at some place called mortise in Indianapolis. There's zero pressure when you perform your do. It's not a fucking, and I'm a feminist, but hey, shut it off dude. Wait until we do it. But the um, you know, when you're, when you're filming something man, it's like a weird, it's a weird pressure thing. You know, like you am, I make sure I get this right. I only got one shot. Like I would never want to do like Bill Hicks, relentless.

Speaker 3:          01:25:06       Like he even said that he wasn't comfortable in it. If you watch it, it's like it's got great material in it, but it's definitely not his best performance and delivery. It's cause he did it all in one shot. It was one, one hour and a half performance ready go. The cameras are on you. We're going to film this forever. Fuck. It's hard to loosen up and the crowd is tight cause it's like, cause they know to the showtime special, it's filling that Gotham comedy club, which is a tiny club anyway. And now it's brightly lit with fucking giant cranes coming over someone's fucking cocktail tables though. I love that place. My, I've never played there except for that. When I filmed at, um, uh, the, uh, southern theater in Ohio, when I did a talking monkey's in space, the guy who was the director of it as a good friend of mine, Anthony Giordano, he's the, he directs the UFC and directs all the UFC like little satellite programs. And I, he listened to me, I said, I don't want any lights in the audience. I want it like a regular show. Let's just do a regular show and we capture on camera. But even then it's hard. The first one was

Speaker 5:          01:26:04       like, it was a little stiff. I felt loose. Like I haven't seen it but scared to watch you. I'm scared to watch comedy. Why? Uh, like I was telling him on the way up, cause I'm afraid after fucking this long doing comedy, I sit there and I go, have I heard this before, if I heard this somewhere else, I've told you I caught myself stealing my own material where I go, fuck, this is funny, but it just seems so familiar and I'll fuck it. I'll do it anyway. And then I like find it in an old notebook. Oh, hey, this isn't fucking knew I wrote this. He used to do this exactly seven years ago. Yeah. So like when I do watch comedy at home, like I'll make sure I'm sober. I won't go to sleep with though. I wouldn't dare like the ideas. We'll get into your head.

Speaker 3:          01:26:59       My friend Mike McCarthy did that once. A friend of mine back in Boston, he went to sleep at the Dennis Miller CD and he woke up with all these new

Speaker 5:          01:27:05       jokes. But anytime you sleep with TV, if you, you know, your dreams will become infused with whatever's what? To bed to fucking sports center. All of a sudden I'm being fisted by a linebacker, but so, you know, I, I'm scared of watching comedy. Aye. Aye. Aye.

Speaker 3:          01:27:25       Still enjoy the fuck out of it. I, you know, want the reason why I got into comedy because I was a fan of comedy. I was going to go see you in Irvine last night, but I was just too lazy. I couldn't make that the drive from La to Irvine at like 5:00 PM his death. You might as well no fucking shoes yourself up plan. Yeah, it's death. But, um, I still agree with someone. Like I saw Louis C k recently at the Improv. I get it. I get inspired by comedy. If I see something that's really funny, I get inspired. It makes me want to write, you know, it makes me want to go.

Speaker 5:          01:27:53       Well that's the other thing is on TV, it's never as good anyway, so it's not hard to go, ah, I'm not gonna Watch this special cause it's a special and a special suck.

Speaker 3:          01:28:03       Well, what I'm hoping is that eventually everything will be accessible all the time and there will be no TV and no sets will be special because everyone will see every set ever seen. Everyone will see everything that you do ever over and over and over the next, the next level of technology is not going to be, you know, something as simple as, oh here's a newer, faster phone. No, it's going to be some super invasive thing while you're allowed to turn on. You're always on Cam and people could just travel with you everywhere you go. And people can watch every fucking thing you do. And there's going to be like some really popular channels where people subscribed shows zero privacy, zero none. Total transparency. There'll be no need for it. No need for us. No one has anything to hide. Right. Why are we, why do we have privacy now? I mean you and I really don't, you know people who are in the public eye who talk a lot about their life on stage, you have a fraction of the privacy.

Speaker 5:          01:28:50       Yeah, I don't, yeah, short of wiping my ass. I'm really fucking, yeah, I don't

Speaker 3:          01:28:56       what do you have a good situation or any, any fucked up situation? I don't mean good. I mean anything where it's juicy,

Speaker 1:          01:29:02       where's there's a story, don't you get excited? Like you just said, like you just got a new puppy. When I got, when my fucking dad died, I was conscious of the fact that a huge part of me was thinking, I'm going to get a lot of attention for this. And what do you do with that? Like you fucking, you, you're aware of that part of you that see like, right, you're right. But you know other people do it. You know they fucking milk fucking tragedy for attention on some level. Well, you know, I, I can't, I can't talk right now. Something really bad happened with the insurers. You Go, you all right. But you know, like I'm at least aware of the fact that I enjoy the why. He used to get excited and when girlfriends had said go wrong, cat died or dog got hit by a car or something. Cause I knew we were going to fuck. You're going to feel bad. I'm going to console you. Next thing you know, we're going to be getting afraid gone. Speaking of fucking, I fucked a girl named Bobby by now. Listen, this is one of my favorite all time. Stand up comedy bits. One A, one of Doug's classics, Bobby Barnett. Check it out. Listen and uh, Doug, we'll be right back in the meantime,

Speaker 8:          01:30:13       Bobby Bar, now it's probably the most,

Speaker 1:          01:30:17       it just died. Brian.

Speaker 8:          01:30:20       Beautiful woman ever match.

Speaker 1:          01:30:22       There we go. Something to take the edge off.

Speaker 8:          01:30:28       Motivation for the clothes.

Speaker 1:          01:30:32       What's on the iTunes?

Speaker 8:          01:30:35       That's true. But that kind of beautiful girl who works retail beautiful. If you life have a flash before your eyes, you'd have to stop at that part and beat off your hand. Eyes rolled up smiling. She had short brown hair and big brown eyes kind of beauty that hurts to look at. I met her in this strange bar in Minneapolis and when I say strange bar, I mean I didn't know anyone there and normally I would never have the balls to approach a girl in a bar that I don't know people. My big approach in of of strange bars to go Sydney far into the bar all alone watch sports center. Like the only reason I'm in a crowded dance club on ladies night is to watch sports book charisma, no volume and hope seller feel sad. But that night, I don't know, I was motivated or just intoxicated and sometimes what's the difference?

Speaker 8:          01:31:50       I talked to her and I don't don't know what bullshit stories. I gave her money. I played right into her hand, whatever she said. I said what she wanted to hear. She hated long hair. I was thinking of cutting that hated cigarettes on is trying to quit whatever it was at work. She said tomorrow the twins are playing the Red Sox, my team, the red sox. She goes, why don't we go to the game? You can stay at my house because it's right near the stadium, not for sex, just out of convenience. Just exactly what I'd tell a girl I was trying to have sex with. So I show up. We had one more drink in her house and that led to kissing, which led to grind it, which led to some of the most vicious dry humping I've seen since two behind school was like Horno with clothes on. It was when it got to a point where I realize it's not going to go any farther than this cause every time I tried to close the deal I can't. I'm not a slot. Well I am and I'll show you how. It's not that hard. Really. Well I don't even know you. Whoa. I'll have my agent facts. My Bio along please. It's starting to hurt here.

Speaker 8:          01:33:11       Finally I gave up like a gentleman. I rolled over, curled up in a warm soft pillow of my own testicle. He went to bed. The next day we go to the twins game. Twins and play in the Red Sox is like 1994 three if you want want to look up the statistics prove this story's true. I'm being an asshole in the stadium cause I'm already pissed and blue bald and I'm a red sox fan so I am trying down, up and down the bleachers. I go, Ooh, bad side. Yeah, you're going to lose. And I keep doing this for six innings, still a red sox again, the shit kicked out of them. They are losing that game. Five to 100 bottom of the sixth Bobby, she starts talking shit and so on. I tried to call her bluff. I say, listen, red sox lose this game. I will quit smoking and cut my hair tonight. Red sox come back and when you turn lose some of that old plussing girl somatically than that was stolen.

Speaker 8:          01:34:28       I said, as soon as she fine. Mo Vaughn came to the plate right out of the fucking phone. The Red Sox scored out 11 on answered abroad and Bobby Barnett sat in the bleachers and turn gray. She's driving me silently. I turned to her and I said, so do you think guys an asshole if I took you up on the bed? But she saying now, so would you think as an asshole if I picked up a homeless guy and told you I wanted to donate my winnings to charity? [inaudible] made good on the bed, but it was only shortly after that she decided she didn't like the kind of person I was. I never talked to her again, but she didn't Welch on the back.

Speaker 8:          01:35:49       The thing is generally beautiful things always make me feel kind of empty, beautiful sunsets and beautiful mountain tops because there's none of that you can take with you. You can take all the pictures in the world. It never does it justice. You use every word in your vocabulary to describe. It never comes out the same. You had to be there watching that beautiful mountain top. There's always a guy next to you goes, doesn't it make you feel insignificant? Yeah. It really does have no need to feel anymore insignificant. I feel very insignificant every day I get that. I go to my hometown bar where all my friends know my name and I'd feel significant. I don't need anything less, but a beautiful woman is different cause a beautiful woman might fuck you. I went to a beautiful woman fucks you. It's like she's giving you part of that beauty. It's like she's giving you part of our soul and that is yours forever. It doesn't ever go away. You're beautiful mountain tops. We'll one may crumble to this. See, your beautiful sunset might never rise again by you thought would be Bobby Barnett. Yes you did. You fucked me. Awesome. Repo man with a thousand tow trucks can never take that back. [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          01:37:31       I don't know if I just shut your shit off. I hit a button on your thing. Your gadget. The kids want to get high. They're just scrambling back to the microphones now and uh, ladies and gentlemen, eyes talking with the Joe Rogan and a turtle from entourage. We're discussing comedy bootcamp. Oh yeah. Comedy fucking bootcamp. [inaudible] name's Chris. I'll feel folks in, if you go to Doug shine help Stan, hope.com. Doug Stan hope.com. I think that's one archive back one archive doctors or a story about comedy bootcamp. There's been a new trend in the comedy community as of late. Is it comedy bootcamp.com? Is that what it is? Yeah. I'm not even sure their website, but they have comedy training classes. And you disagreed strongly on the premise and practice.

Speaker 5:          01:38:20       Yeah, no, I, I think as a, as a community comics all agree that classes are bullshit. Unless they have to go teach them, then they go, well, no. Yeah. It's not all bullshit. Right. So yeah, there's this Guy Kyle cease, uh, started a pretty hardcore like traveling. He got Louie Anderson on the, uh, on the ticket as Kyle and Louie are going to travel. Yeah. They go town to town. The way they'll take an Improv for, they'll get 80% of the door, uh, and th th th and teach these comedy, you have to really read the fucking thing.

Speaker 1:          01:39:02       So the comics get on stage, so let's, let me get this straight. So if they do this comedy class and they go around the world around the country, rather say if they show up the Improv and

Speaker 5:          01:39:11       yeah, Florida West Palm, it's a comedy all day intensive, one day, October 8th that the fucking Fort Lauderdale funny market.

Speaker 1:          01:39:21       So there's a hundred people in the class and they all have to pay how much money

Speaker 5:          01:39:25       between $403,000 depending on which course. The one day course is only 400 bucks. A three day intensive master's stand up is like 3000 but either way it's all fucking nonsense. And this I, I, I've gotten emails from the guy, let's just assume you've read the fucking thing. If not,

Speaker 1:          01:39:48       go to it. Go to [inaudible] dot com and yeah, pause this and because it's way too much to get it in your car. Tough Shit. Just you're going to have to do the math if you're not a comic,

Speaker 5:          01:39:59       you don't want to hear all the fucking discourse anyway. It's really, it's an inside kind of thing. But the fact that it's scumbag, hurry to tell someone, oh yeah, I can make you a fucking master stand up and fucking three short days.

Speaker 1:          01:40:13       He, they really called him master stand up mastery is the $3,000 course. That's strong words. Yeah. Yeah. Mastery. You're going to be a master of this 10 years, right. I mean, I barely think I know what I'm doing now and I'm 22 years in, you know, but I know I saw declining it. If I had a fucking time machine, I definitely wouldn't recommend you going back in time any earlier than 10 years into my camp comedy career, right. Camera. I can't recommend any of those shows. Pre 1999 he says you're on your own. You want to go see it just for fucking a point of reference to realize that someone can suck really hard and come back from that strong. Right. But I don't recommend those shows. But, uh, so, so

Speaker 5:          01:40:54       yeah, you read the fucking thing

Speaker 3:          01:40:56       so you don't, you don't think that there's any way that there's, there's a benefit of having some sort of a class to teach people standing.

Speaker 5:          01:41:03       You can take it, you can get all that advice for free. That was my major beats. Anything they will teach you in a class, any comic is glad to tell you for free or just at the fucking bar at the Improv or just get a job at the out at the bar, the old school way to do it. I agree. That is the old school way to do it. But you're still not going to learn until you do it. Yes. I want to teach you how to be like you are. Cause comics aren't like actors. We're not all going for the same part. We have to be different. So to take advice, you're only telling someone how to be more like you. Joe and I did attack Kyle cease brutally because that's my, the fashion of my comedy where I'm saying that his family should die. Something like that. It's always us. It's always just to give a little flavor to the update doesn't really mean that I don't want your family to die, Kyle cease. But I think what you're doing is negligent, irresponsible and uh, dishonor. But you, you

Speaker 3:          01:41:58       get so upset about it because it's, I mean, in terms of like negligent or irresponsible shit that the rest of the world sees, it's really fairly mild. Oh, course. You'd just get upset about this one particular subject because it's something that you love

Speaker 5:          01:42:11       because I'm calling, it's something that I know and it's something I can make a difference. I can yell about fucking government invasion of civil liberties all day and it's not going to do a fucking dicks were the difference. But I could say Kyle sees is a fucking fraud and it might save you between 403,000 oaks.

Speaker 3:          01:42:29       No, maybe it's not a bad idea to get both. Maybe it's not a bad idea for someone to go to one of these comedy bootcamps and you know, just get turned out. Look when I didn't know if I was going to do comedy, you know, I had been talked into doing it by some friends of mine. I just went to an open mic night. I didn't know shit that open Mike night. If I had $3,000, you know, easily could have been, you know, some comedy bootcamp. Well fuck it, I'm going to try it out. Like, you know, when there's 1920 year old kids are, they're young and they have no experience and it's not a bad thing to just get somehow and other introduced to it. And then once you get introduced to, you immerse yourself in standup comedy, he started listening to a bunch of it and watching a bunch of youtube clips. Then you read your story on it and listen to you talk about it and go, oh, okay, this guy doesn't know what the fuck he's talking about. And he just knows what the fuck he's talking about for him.

Speaker 5:          01:43:14       Right, exactly. And uh, I'll give you this, that it might act as a catalyst to make you become committed and have always thought about him doing some momentum. Yeah. And so, you know, now it's like, uh, hypnotism to stop smoking. It doesn't fucking work. You're not hypnotized. But the fact that you just laid out $250, I'm going to tell you hypnotize for 30 minutes might make you not smoke just cause you don't want to feel like a Douche bag. So if it has that effect, but what you're doing is you're, you're gliding the market. He talks about how he's got all these comics now and they're working together in these communities and they having writer's clubs together, what you're doing, you're, you're saying everyone's innately funny, which is so horribly untrue. And what you're doing is giving them perseverance to keep fucking bothering bookers and bothering promoters and clogging up open Mike nights with shitty comedy because you told them don't quit. Keep trying. I agree. You're not fucking funny it whatsoever. But out of those, like you're, you're speaking to the worst case scenarios. So if there's a hundred people that take his course, there might be one or two that sneaks through the fucking salmon ladder. They would actually, anyway, they might, they might anyway. And they might in spite of, but he might have introduced them to the game. He might've gotten them inspired. A lot of girls are in porn cause they got raped.

Speaker 3:          01:44:43       I see your point. When I was starting out in comedy, there was a guy, I don't want to say his name because he's a nice guy. He just sucks. And he uh, he, one time he was hosting an open mic night and he came up to me and he was like, listen, I'm going to tell you right now, okay, you want to be a comic, you got to stop swearing. He goes, you're always swearing. You swear. Well you don't have a punchline. You swear to make it funnier. And I'm like, well, you know, the guys who I liked were really funny. Like Sam Kinison and dice clay, you're not die clay. Okay, you're not dice clay. And he told me about this one joke he had. I can't say the joke because then everybody in Boston would know who the fuck I'm talking about. And I don't know guys, his life sucks.

Speaker 3:          01:45:19       I don't want to shit on them. But the idea was that he took this word fuck out of one of his jokes and it made it, he had to focus more on his timing and I don't always like, that's ridiculous. You're joke sucks. This is a fucking, you're telling me how to do you and I'm even think you're good. You know, it's like you fuck. You know. It's like people will try to get you to follow their pattern. You can't do that. There's no way you can get, you can tell someone how to do comedy, but,

Speaker 5:          01:45:46       well, hang on then I'm going to, because we're talking specifically about Kyle sees, I don't know anything about that deal. I should just say this. I know what I've seen the clips of this. It's like Anthony Robbins fucking Scientology. Believe in yourself. Find your inner voice. They don't, and that's the thing. Every fucking comedy. What's the guy that got in my face at Montreal? The fucking industry guys. Step Up. Your stand up. The guy looks like he's wearing the fake glasses. The nose, but he's not. That's Jeff singer. I don't know who that is. Jeff Singer. He's, I guess some industry guy and he got in my face cause I mentioned him in the update going, I don't do what he does. He's like, you got your face. Yeah, he was saying that Kyle sees his shit. You don't understand. I'm not like him. Why would you put write that about me?

Speaker 5:          01:46:36       Yeah. As I'm fucking awful night at the fucking Delta borrower, whatever dealt in Montreal, it's not the delta anymore. They moved hotels but it's the same scene drunk and the guys like fuck you. Like Hey, I don't agree with point is Kyle's, Oh I, we don't tell people how to write jokes. You can't teach that. But what we do is we motivate them and make them believe and find their own voice. You're still full of shit. They are full of Shit. They definitely, and I want to address this because one of the beefs that I've, a few beefs that I've gotten from it is why did you attack him and not Louie Anderson? Why we just got a little guy scared. Yeah. Scared. Well, that's the thing is, and I sat there, why? First of all, as I was talking to Hannah, give my manager and he said, no. He goes, well, uh, Louie Anderson wouldn't be doing this if it weren't for Kyle seat.

Speaker 5:          01:47:36       Kyle sees fucking hell. Yeah. He got the guy on and Louie Anderson is such such a feeble guy. You don't ever look at him as someone you have to take down. Kyle ceases the one promoting this fucking hokey. The secret I met Kyle cease to the Improv. You seem like a nice guy. That's literally all I know about. No fucking he'd send me emails and he's fucking tears. You're one of my heroes. Like you're not the same fucking washing on me. I lost into your fucking podcast. But Jimmy Dore, every comic that whose name came up was one of your favorites. Oh, it's one of those guys. Yeah, he's one of those, you know, it's funny as hell. No, look, I can't fault the guy for not being snow. There's, and there's a lot of things he says that I think you're a fucking fact. The majority of what he says.

Speaker 5:          01:48:25       I think is good advice. I don't think it's bad to get more people interested in doing standup because I think just with sheer numbers, I mean there's going to be a bunch that suck, but there'll also be more, but they're using it as a scan will be problem. Like I just started doing a see the point, but I don't think you need to be compensated. If you're going to spend three fucking days talking to some open makers and it's going to have to be some, a long cash song taller. Here's a, here's a crazy fucks. This is what new comedy, this is what it really solidified the fact that this guy is a fucking okay Connie. He emails me and he's breaking down how he's losing money and he gives me actual numbers where he says we averaged 30, uh, 30 people per class and if you know, and then it's $400 times 30, that's $12,000 and he says, and will, and most of that goes to airfare, hotel, et cetera. Wait, hang on. You and Louie Anderson teach class. You make $12,000 in a day and you're losing money, you of all people should not be teaching anything, right? How many hotel rooms do you get for you and Louie Anderson? You're making $12,000 a day. What's the et Cetera? Cause airfare.

Speaker 1:          01:49:48       That's about 800 bucks for the two years hotel at a nice place down 400 goddamn fascinating reality show. Feel free to steal this idea because I'm lazy and I won't produce it, but comedy camp.com traveling, doing some sort of a like grizzly man. You ever watch grizzly man where it's unintentionally funny? The Guy Werner Herzog had to know that guy was hilarious. He had hadn't know what he's putting together. It's going to be hilarious. He couldn't admit it, but he had it know there could be one of the most beautiful, Beautiful Cohen brothers ask reality shows ever. Louie Anderson and Kyle sees on the road teaching this funky comedy class meeting with these crazy open miker is all over the country.

Speaker 6:          01:50:28       It's crazy. Standup comedy is actually kind of getting into a scam. I don't know if if there's no money into it or not. Cause I've been doing it lately and I'm watching these little open mic, hers get attacked. But like sales, like TV salesmen type ways like, hey, here's the deal. So I run the show at the comedy store, belly room, all right, you give me $100 I'll give you a 20 tickets to give to all your friends. Now you can charge your friends these tickets, money or whatever you, so you're going to make money, but I'm going to be five minutes and I'm watching this. You know that's how they do. That's how they pay fighters and like low level organizations that give them tickets. Right? Right. But, but the problem is is that a, the belly room is free to get in. So these tickets make no sense at all.

Speaker 6:          01:51:07       Right. You know, and so, and so this girl, she's like always framed the belly room for the most part. But here's, here's the thing. This girl's only been doing comedy six months. The guy that even came up to her and said, hey, you had a great set tonight. I was watching this dude cause like my other friend Jordan said the same thing happen to him last time he was just praying and he's, he wasn't even watching her. He came up there and did this whole sales pitch and like, like, like oh you know, it's 20 tickets,

Speaker 1:          01:51:28       stuff like that. And I feel bad for that. But I also feel like that's kind of funny cause it's all so yeah, it's kind of the fucking ominously I think less than zero, you know, con artistry. And that might be why I get upset at something so fucking simple as a standup comedy class, which really has on the fucking grand scale makes no difference. It's just, but I think fraud is the most undervalued art form con artistry is called, it's called con art for a reason. It's fucking art. If it's done well, there's nothing more beautiful than hearing about a very inventive scam rift and comedy preying on like these little kids that are set in a comic. But wait a minute man. You were one of those at one point in time and I was one of those at one point in time when I was 21 years old.

Speaker 1:          01:52:17       You could have easily talked me into doing some fucking comedy course. Right. I would have saved up my money. I don't take acting course. I was completely ripped off when I was 18 I had a bad acting teacher. That was an earn while you learn program, they're going to get you gigs while they fucking, you paid them to go weekly but we'll, we'll get you working. Get yet to casting agents. They do that with models too, right? [inaudible] how is it classic took the train to La as soon as I was 18 with 400 bucks in my pocket, I get off the at union station

Speaker 3:          01:52:46       and I'm going to be an actor. What? It didn't work out when I was in Boston. Every girl you had a model in photo number one girls what used to go to modeling Casablanca. Yeah. And they would take the photo with the girl that's standing like this and like her hair blowing in the wind and the poses. They would spend all this money. It was basically a huge scam when they would just get these girls to spend a fuckload of money on getting their photos taken and then they get their photos taken with this guy's logo at the bottom of it and they would send it out and nothing would ever happen. But it was like these girls like camp and doing some modeling. I mean slink out some new shots.

Speaker 1:          01:53:22       It's a mildly, every fucking God damn was models. Crazy. Bitches aren't even that good. Tell your friends, I can't even say early in the night he was drunk.

Speaker 3:          01:53:38       She was drunk and I was just trying to avoid her. I was trying to avoid her. I was just trying to avoid her and she goes to me,

Speaker 1:          01:53:43       you think you're off fear factor. He's young. My face with this fucking thing in the fingers moving. He think like those girls get sloppy drunk every weekend. Those are trends. They know what the fuck they're doing is fucking just milky, awful bleach in and shaved pussies wiring, cigarette breath and fucking dirty ass holes. Still Lou Fain titties black fucking shearer socks and make your feet sweat and it's smelling shit tube top and belly hair, blue eyeshadow thrown up in the Tori. Don't leave. Don't leave you fucking as though I, oh my God. Can you imagine having a, if I ran into half the chicks I boned as a teenager now cause they were pigs then. Oh Man, I see him now at our age.

Speaker 3:          01:55:12       Oh I went and found my, my original high school girlfriend on Facebook and I opened up her thing and said send her a message and I went like that with my fingers and I hovered over the keyboard and I wanted to apologize. I want to apologize for being me. I want to apologize for being 14 I wanted to apologize for the whole fucking thing. I mean here, but you know this is, this is the first one. This is the first one. And I looked at it and I'm like, okay,

Speaker 1:          01:55:37       let's shut this thing off. Close the window. Like what are we going to do? I'm 43 years old. I'm going to apologize for being a Douche bag when I was 16 you're a con. Too stupid. It wasn't going to be this. You got the fucking fat. Fuck you when you move to fucking western Massachusetts. I went there once, I drove an hour and a half. You didn't even fuck me because you're mad at me. Shit. I just had that show it did I tell you what to do? This either fucking act, no, I'm done. I write it down. Somebody wrote something down. I had this x

Speaker 6:          01:56:04       chap me on Facebook and was like, Hey, I have something very important to tell you like, and I'm like, what's, what is it? And I'm like, no, I need to talk to you in person. I can't do this over chat. And this is from like 12 years ago or something like that. So I'm like thinking, all right, it's one of three things. They either have a child or I have aids or she found Jesus. It's like one of the three things I'm going to wear face. I'm going to your Facebook. And I'm like, all right, these kids look kind of retarded. It might be mine. I don't know. They kind of look, that kid looks a little Asian or whatever. So she calls me up and she goes, Hey, I just want you to know something that you remember that abortion, you paid for it and like, yeah, and she goes, I just need money for heroin. I started doing heroin after we broke up and I really needed money, so I made, I said this whole thing that I was pregnant and I,

Speaker 1:          01:56:42       oh, I thought you said, you told me. She said she was pregnant with another guy and it wasn't actually, she said

Speaker 6:          01:56:47       she was pregnant with her new heroin friend guy, but they spent so much money on heroin, they needed money and I gave her like $500 it wasn't like regular like

Speaker 1:          01:56:54       did you ever see the money back hunt? No. High dollar seven 50 and suck my Dick Dude. I said, dude, like interest. Yeah. You should at least get an extra 250 bucks in a blow job. It was, it was crazy cause I sold my Carolyn. Hey, and then she's off on her tits rot. That's why a little of my comic books, I forgot Coles and shoot loads. Why? I sold my comic books. I forgot I sold my whole comic book collection to pay for this abortion. Okay, well now she's a fuck. She has ruined your iron man collection. Spider. What was your favorite comment? That one has that story. Yeah. I sold my comic books paper and, Oh boy. Yeah, that's your story. It wasn't even a boy. So if it's for heroin, anyone who's dealing with anyone who needs an abortion or heroin should not have comic ducks. You shoot a minimal fucking survival kit like les Stroud around Ranch House. You just shit to keep your water clean and a knife to fend them off. Check this, check this out. As I was in play a del Rey fucking trade, my baseball cards kept my fucking girlfriend a new liver.

Speaker 6:          01:58:03       I was in Playa del Rey and I was, I was after the bar closed, it was that that bar we were talking about was like 30 people fit in this bar. And it's just like for locals only, it's, the school board has been there since the 19 hundreds so anyways, after the bar, we're hanging out in this way.

Speaker 1:          01:58:14       Old Lady 110 years ago. No. So, so there's hundreds, 10 years ago, the old lady, this old lady comes up to me and grabs me

Speaker 6:          01:58:23       by the sweatshirt and she goes, I see your necklace, you wear that because it protects you. And I'm like, what the fuck you're talking about?

Speaker 1:          01:58:28       Oh this is the story you were telling me. I would advise you before you go into the story. This is all led to not really say it. I gotta tell Ya. I gotta tell you, this is a person who is in the public guy who got a little fucked up but a little drunk and made some mistakes. And I'm just saying if you were in the same situation and you did the same situation to a person younger than never, grab a person and let them lead you. You get, she was doing it. We all get fucked up and we're not ourselves. Okay. That's the reality of the situation. The right mixture. We'll a little bit of crystal math, a little bit of Jack Daniels. You can make some mistakes. I want to say it, but Nancy Cartwright tried to, oh, I don't know who that Nancy Cartwright's the voice of Bart Simpson and she tried to rape me.

Speaker 1:          01:59:10       Oh, that sound to tell that story. Hi folks. I try so hard to save his Karma. I should just say this right now, Brian, right now. Can you queue up prince? I got a broken heart again. Cue this up. We have to talk. We have to talk. Brian, Brian's in a situation. You could just look up prince. I got a broken heart again. Okay. You got your phone on. Okay. Brian is a great guy. He's, I know. He's a good friend. He's one of the most interesting people I've ever met. In my life. I would tries to fuck him though. So if someone pays his child, fuck you. It's a good story for him. It's a good story for him, but he's right now vulnerable place. Eat my shorts. I would eat her short. Brian, if Brian was on top of the world like he was just a month ago, just a month, just a month ago.

Speaker 1:          02:00:00       Can we talk about how on top of the world you are, do you want me to use euphemisms? Let's just say this. Okay. Let's just say this. Pretend. Let's just pretend that a salmon's a song called again. Huh? What does the song prince got? A broken heart again. Let's pretend that there's, there's, there's a man and on the one to 10 he's a three. I mean he said it's a fucking witty three. He's an interesting three. Call me a three. I'm just making up stories, dude. I can't make it so close to you that it's realistic. If I had a judge, you honestly, I'd say if you lost 20 pounds, you'd be an eight. Right now you're probably a six and a half percent. I remember. Is that on? Is that honest? I was not mad. Right. Fat The fucking, before I was nearly this fat, Brian was a stud when he was, I was on the fucking man show is what I was fighting Tonya Harding.

Speaker 1:          02:00:45       And I remember fucking him standing with jugging. Kathy was one of the most beautiful women in the world and he's like, look at his fucking body. You're so disgusting, Dude. Let me look at you. And that was what I was way less disgusting. So back in the day. Yeah. Yeah. Well, so let's be realistic. Okay, Brian, let me give you, I'm going to give you a rating of a six and a half, seven if you just continue on your current path of losing weight. Okay. That's realistic. I don't think I'm a more than an eight, right? I was, I was pretty much a nine when I was on news radio, but I'm old and my Shit's falling apart. Okay. Let's be honest right now I think on a more attractive than the news. Radio got a strong nine. Yeah, nine. So Brian was with a strong nine [inaudible] you're fucking never agree.

Speaker 1:          02:01:31       On the chicks because the chicks, you call it nine and he showed me a picture and I go, that's a fucking real doll. That isn't even snotty. You're looking for something different. We have different, we've always had different opinions on what's fucking for sure. Yeah, for sure. We have, yeah. We've always had like, fuck. Yeah, some chicks that you would think of. Wicked. Skanks I make a perfect 10 what do you like? What you that girl can I like to, I like, I like girls with unfortunate tattoos. There's girls that like just that there's a porn look now there's not even, there's, there's no difference. She did. She was, she was in there like the fund, this girl, this girl, this girl was some chick that works at the local fucking, she works at the local car seat. Fucking manufacturer, you know, working in the book.

That's what it means, right? It's a product. It's a product, but you know, doesn't count with mom issues or HIV. You get her alone. Then the next thing you know, you're a fucking, yeah, you're, you're banging it out and you're like, I can't even believe this girl's let me fuck you. Well, he had that situation for awhile, back and forth, a little separation, little break up. It just wasn't ready for that kind of frequency. The kid wasn't ready hit the songs. Brian, I'm trying your, your Wifi sucks, does it? Yeah. Really. It doesn't really work too much. Joe Hates it when you fucking talk about his technical ineptitude gadgetry thing. We need to put a block by rob tod. You Mow your Wifi. Joe is about five and a half.

Speaker 1:          02:03:07       Oh, don't you go there? You don't know Mark Merrin's podcast has fucking Wifi out the mark. Man. Just send me an email asking me to do is pop. I probably will. I just don't want to argue with them. I like Mark Matt. I think he's a good dude, but he says dumb shit. I don't wanna. I don't want to get cocky with them. That's why not. That's what I want to argue with anybody. I ain't got no time. I know, but if you're not arguing, it's a fucking low rated podcast. I will listen to podcasts. Are you doing Carlos men? Sia on Mark Marin. I listened to Dane Cook on Mark Marin and I didn't know you had done Dane Cook. So I'll listen to that. And I listened to the fucking, what train do use name is that had the Kyle cease on, you're just looking for train wrecks. Exactly.

Speaker 1:          02:03:57       What do you want to fucking, I don't want to the lesson here. Well listen to fucking two guys who agree breakdown like the Paul Provenza who I love women. This is the best podcast we've ever done. This is the best, best podcast I've ever done. And we, you and I are almost completely in agreement on everything except the, the, the level of demonic aptitude Kyle sees is has it is fucking show. That's it. I know. But I'm saying that's, that doesn't get fucking people I don't go to listen to. That's okay. You guys get along. That's just you, your point of view. I understand what you're saying. I understand that. I just don't, my point of view is at this point in time, I'm a, I'm a grown man. I don't want to play these stupid games. I don't want to argue with anybody who

Speaker 3:          02:04:38       just don't just stop, stop. I don't, I don't want to hear it. I don't care. And I can't, I've thoroughly dissected my own personal thoughts and I don't want to deal with the mess that's in your head. Okay. I don't want to have to fucking sit down and go, well, okay, let's back up. Where did you come to this perception and how did this start out? And maybe you didn't take into account how I felt. I don't want to care. I've got no time. You know, he's doing one of your bits therein. He did his show and um, he hadn't been seen on and he had this like ramp up or he like gives his take on it and he said the men Sia incident was two bullies arguing over bullshit. That's how he said it. And I just said,

Speaker 9:          02:05:21       done, done.

Speaker 3:          02:05:24       That's it. You just saved me weird conversations for the rest of my life. Just don't like to talk to you anymore. I don't have to talk to you tomorrow. I can wish you well. I'm Karma free. I can say good luck. Have Fun. Take care. Don

Speaker 9:          02:05:37       done.

Speaker 3:          02:05:37       It's nice. It's nice to, there's a lot of problems in this world. You can't fix them all. Sometimes it's good to Jess.

Speaker 9:          02:05:44       Now let's go back to Brian.

Speaker 3:          02:05:49       Brian, his good friend I met Brian Online is talented. He makes these incredible videos and I'm like, what do you do man? He told me, he goes, I, I worked for gateway. I was like, dude, you need to come work for me. I don't even know what the fuck you're going to do, but we're just gonna make some videos. We're going to make shit happen. We're going to have some fun. Just come with me on the road. We'll films are shit, man. Fuck that crazy job. That job sucks. He's like, okay. Years ago, right? So while ago, so he comes, he Compson brands out there and new world, man, we're traveling but Kona, fucking comedy clubs and going on TV shows going all over the world. We go on. Opie and Anthony were in New York. Okay. We're all over the place. Brian's from Columbus, Ohio. And this girl is from Venus perhaps.

Speaker 3:          02:06:37       Maybe. Perfect. Right. Perfect girl. Your perfect girl. Yes sir. What, what the fuck would ever make you think that you would be able to fuck her? Right, right. In real life. It's like how does this happen? How does anybody get the fuck doesn't have a weak channel, strong eyebrows body. How does anybody get the fucker? There's certain girls in this world, like any girl that's over a nine it's like really any guidance. Fucking I was like really? Because every guy that's fucking at nine it's fucked sixes and fives and can't believe that anybody who talks to him anymore. But as a whole fucking Bobby Barnett, he never wrapped up cause you're outside smoking all the Bobby find that tape. Yeah, go with bags. Like three, four archives, genius. She finally found out, someone in my fans from Sweden actually tracked her down whether new fucking married name and she heard that bit and is a born again Christian now and said to very upset emails.

Speaker 3:          02:07:28       So that's it. Doug. Stan hope doc, which by the way made the bid 20,000 times better. Yeah, it was beautiful and your was just fucking spectacular. I honestly think that you have to do that on stage. What I think you should do is play the original recording on stage for people who don't know, for the new fans. Let them hear that and then tell the new store. Just do. Then you'd been on states. A fucking destroyer I think you should close with that would be pretty fucking lazy. I go, well, first you to this bit. I won't say that. You can say you can say it. I don't mean that. I mean I feel weird telling old joke. Oh, I did too. I won't do it. More weird to go. I know I could say this. Let me just hit play. I do old bits at during my question and answer after I've done like an hour or so.

Speaker 3:          02:08:12       I always do a question to answer because at this point in time, I mean I joke around about it onstage, but this is in order to keep a real honest relationship with all these people that come out to see me, I don't think I should be doing the one that gets a talk. I always say that. I would say this feels weird, like the whole standup comedy, the the, the, the whole art form is you get onstage and there's a microphone. There's a bunch of people that pay to hear you talk and that's ridiculous. You're going to be the only one who talks for an hour to cocaine dream. It's crazy. I get to fucking get to do the coke and now it's my sentence for an hour and you don't get a chance. I always talk about it, how I understand that this is a ridiculous relationship and in order to compensate for the fact that it's ridiculous, I do the best I can.

Speaker 3:          02:08:50       I write the most shit I do. I explore the most ideas. I tried to give you the most shit. I got the most hyped up for the show and I also do a question to answer why. So she yell out anything you want, we'll talk about anything you want. You know, and, and that's, that's like an opportunity for people to, they can, they can yell shit out. They can talk about anything they want. If I were, if we were going to do, I'm sorry. That's what I do. Old Bits. This is a, this, that would be a perfect time for all of us to fucking do. If I knew other comics would do this, I would do a fucking Q and a at the end of every show for wannabe standup comics. So you can get advice for fucking free. That's all you should ever pay for comedy advice.

Speaker 3:          02:09:31       That's not a bad idea everywhere. But you know what you know and not be a bad idea. If you said, you know, he had people sign up for an advance. They couldn't be just somebody who wanted to photograph no photos, no autographs, can't waste any time. But after every show there'll be one half hour Q and a section session for want to be stand up comedian. So, so you have to be honest about the fact that you want to be a comedian and if you are, you're allowed to common. There's a Roman, there's 100 of us and we're going to sit there and I'll let you talk for half an hour. Right? That's a great idea. You know what? You fucking wait outside for a half an hour after the show, like fight club and that'll get rid of the Douche bags that are just drunk. You want to fucking say something stupid? Wait out on the porch like flight club. While if you really want to fucking be a stand up, we'll give you, that's how I avoid crazy people at my shows when I take pictures with them afterwards I sit down for 10 minutes, take a leak, have a glass of water, just to let everybody just really fucking frantic. Just go about their way. Right. Let's do fucking gyms all over me with your douchey miss. Yeah. You sell merge? No, I did a couple of times. I've sold a DD hats fucking tradeoff. I can

Speaker 1:          02:10:34       either sell, merge and have to fucking dive right into this right from stage and that head full of, you know, and then right to politician. Nice to meet you. Oh, I'd love to fuck you. Take a picture with your wife. Right from fucking are you go. All right. I cannot sell merge. First of all, merge sales. It's not just the money that you're making, it's the fact that you're getting your product out there, right. I'm not on fucking television. You're all people finding me because someone sent him a link to a cleaner way off now. Okay. I disagree. You're not off the grid. Okay. You're on the Internet, man. You're not an internet. I'm saying this is, this is, there's a website that I frequent all the time called mixed martial arts.com and uh, it's has nothing to do with you. And there's a, there's a section called the underground where they talk about MMA fights, but there's the other ground where they talk about anything else and they always have sections on comedians and your name comes up all the time.

Speaker 1:          02:11:29       And I understand that, but I'm saying that you, you have to feed that sense. Yes. Yes. I agree. At the same time, a million people have said, I never even heard of you. Sorry. No offense man. I never heard of you until my buddy low your DVD. Yeah. So yeah, it's, it's getting that out there. So that's the other important thing about birch. You don't, you don't give a fuck about torrents or anything like that, do you? Do you ever, you don't an idea. I don't give a fuck about that shit when people have my shit on my phone. Every camera. No, no, no. It is computers. You don't know what a bit torn is where you can download movies. Oh, stealing. Yeah, still. No, I'm all for stealing. And this is what it's not stealing. Well listen, listen to this skill from the fuse and you'll agree with me and this is fucking very important.

Speaker 1:          02:12:12       I encourage you fucking downloading and sharing and burning files of all the shit that I've released, but don't come to the show. And you decide when I'm releasing my new CD on your fucking cell phone camera. I agree. That makes me, I agree. It is annoying. However, I also think that it looks as long as everybody else can just deal with the real hardcore fans of you're gonna go research these videos can deal with the fact that this is material that's in, it's in development. You know it starts out here. Maybe you want to watch them develop and that's all cool too. But don't fucking go to shows and yell out punchlines when you know what they are. Cause he saw a clip on youtube and the bid is only a month old and it's going through some metamorphosis. Like don't be a Douche bag. But as long as you're not a Douche bag and you come to a show, I don't mind if you, you know, I don't mind all the, I had you down for a reason cause I hate looking at myself.

Speaker 1:          02:13:01       So when I see someone with a million reasons, I agree. I'm worried about how I look. I've taken me totally. I would take you out of your day if you're fucking had seven 11 I just start filming. You have no reason. Absolutely agree. It's really distracting. It was the Ice House in Pasadena and I yelled at some lady, but I wasn't really mad, but I was like, he can't just fucking live your life. Don't fucking live your life through a fucking youtube clip. This is ridiculous. Just just enjoy this moment. You don't have to relive it or live your three rows away from, I don't affect you enough that you can remember the shit that I said then it's not really worth it. Just to enjoy the good feeling that you had while you were there and come see me again to see. I'll have to fucking live through a Goddamn Lens.

Speaker 1:          02:13:41       I've said, I've said the same thing I've, I've said don't fill me in so many bucking ways. Now you actually have bits on it, right? Your bits of people filming? I've had, yeah. I've had a number of bits. I have more bits about about stop filming me than overpopulation. Again, can't be honest. I can't tell you stuff. I can't say that my girlfriend's sister is. If I, if my girlfriend's sister was a fat cunt, you couldn't do a bit about what does she do is she was a big fat cut and did something really awful and I wanted to talk about it. And you have can't talk about my fucking nephews kind of say no, no little loony violent. He, he looks at the moon a lot. Nice. I said, but I could never do bits cause he, he's kind of an idiot savant. He knows how to use computers. Some people in my life that are hanging onto a thread because I'm thinking about throwing them down the river. I'm talking about chucking them under the bus and do it a fuck closing bid on them. There's a few people in my life where I think about how crazy they are. I'm like, motherfucker, I just want to, you're going to be my closing again.

Speaker 1:          02:14:48       But you can't cause it fucking hurts when it comes back. Yeah. You don't want them to be upset people, you know, you can make fun of me all day, but making fun of other people, man, for people, making someone making fun of you. You don't even know them for most people. And it's like for us it's like you just get like, don't Google your name. Cause if you do some anonymous Douche bags can be mad at you somewhere for sure. And I hate myself so much. That's just a voice seconding what I already thought. This is what I find that I'm sure you find the same way. Do you find yourself like hating yourself the most when you have to edit your shit when you have to like go like edit a DVD or something like that and you watch your bits over over January. Oh you shut the fuck up.

Speaker 1:          02:15:26       Yeah. No I, I might, I can't stand a fucking way. I look, people just sound, we're egomaniacs are narcissists. It's like when you, when you're editing your, get to a certain point in your comedy, I think when you get to a certain point where you really kind of appreciate what this is all about and this is really not all about all this personal intention that's really not all about, you know, people loving you. It's really about like finding a way to tune into all these crazy ideas so that other people get enjoyment out of it. And when you hear yourself do it, you hear yourself say it, it's you. It's you saying it's you doing it. You're judging yourself. You're like, shut the fuck up. Yeah. No, I, I don't like doing comedy. I really don't. And lots of really though you do though, you say you don't, but you do.

Speaker 1:          02:16:09       I know you, if I could bullshit, you wouldn't do what you don't want to do. You can tell you like it. There's moments you like you don't like, you might not like 40% of it. Okay. There's loads going on stage crush. You love it. Yeah. No, no. Come on. When you knock it out of the park, when you really find a fucking, but when I knocked out of that really locks into people's heads and they go, yes, fuck yeah. But I've, I like everything that I've been passionate about. I've beaten into the ground, right? I've, I can't fucking do another overpopulation. I'll probably find a way to help you, can help you with all of these things. I can help you with all these songs. No, I do it out of the parts of me is when I come up with something off the top of my head when I actually riff and I get a couple of fucking lines that's knock it, I can have a shitty show, but if I said something that amused me like, Oh fuck, that was fun.

Speaker 1:          02:17:02       That's funny. You just need them. When I say write that down to someone in the fucking audience, that's when I'm knocking on it. Yeah, yeah, yeah. But those moments are worth it. All those moments are worth it all where you are the fucking lightning rod and the bolt hits you out of the heavens and you get this thought when you're on stage that you really never went down that avenue before, but all the sudden you'd go there and the audit, it just destroys your howling laughing at the thought that you didn't even, you don't even know where the fucking came from. He could scarcely take photos. I was just saying to someone that, the applause that you hear before the show, when they announce you, Doug's Stan hope and you hear that fucking massive round of applause is nothing but fucking terror of expectations that I don't think I can meet.

Speaker 1:          02:17:46       Yeah. I don't feel like that's love and I worked hard for that. I feel like they want more than I have to. That's one of the problems that you had with the Kyle sees comedy course and you use a brilliant example where you're talking about David Tell who's one of my favorite comedians and your favorite comedians and one of the most unique guys in my opinion. They'd come along lot a little records, his set, he still has a fucking mini recorder and he listens to his sets after 20 some years of comedy. Yeah. And he gets mad at himself and he doesn't like his bed and he doesn't believe in them and he gets upset and he gets insecure. Meanwhile he's brilliant, you know. And that was the example that you use that you don't always have to be confident. That's not true. Like sometimes you can just do it and be ashamed of everything you say and ashamed of every laugh you get.

Speaker 1:          02:18:29       It's still, it's still formula man. Yeah. A lot of guys are only successful because they hate themselves so much. There's no formula for anything than any of us do. [inaudible] head Hedberg funny that as soon as they became successful dive set another fucking word. Yeah, a lot of them. How about a lot of them? How about a lot of them forgot what it's all about. Right? In the reason why the forgot what it's all about. It's cause he's fucking, people are hungry at one point in time they were that were really, most comedy comes from a place of fear and hate and it's just a matter of chips come perspective. In my opinion. Ma Hedberg Hedberg was at a pers perfect example where you look at that guy on paper, like the shit that he would say on paper. Like the joke about doubletrees. Yeah. You know, how did they, do they have a meetings? How did they name that? Let's call it two trees. No, let's call a double tree meeting adjourned. It's like she'd be funny. Why is that funny? I mean while I'm alone in my car, laughing my ass off and I hear it on Xm radio,

Speaker 3:          02:19:28       there's certain guys that they just, they find out. Joey Diaz. Perfect example. You've said at best you said Joey Diaz could read the phone book and there'd be funnier than 90% of the comments [inaudible] guys, you don't think you did Wayne that term? No, I think that might not have yet is a term, but I read shade. Expression is I didn't want to get, Oh, I'm setting forth. You said it best when you said it and I heard I can't say it. Third hand you can say it second hand. I can't say it. Third Day I had to take, I got you and I have to go. Do I have to do soon? Six, 10 let's find a closer, but let's talk. Let's talk about a question. You know, here's a six pack. I think we drank a lot of beer. We drink all of them. I think I'm pretty fucked up yours over there.

Speaker 3:          02:20:09       By the way. This is the only time I've ever been. I need to, this is only a time drunk on a podcast and on top of it stops you in the middle. Do two of these big ass bitches. Didn't have anything to two here. You know, it's 6:00 PM. I've had, oh, I had eggs, lies, lies, lies, had pancakes today. Headlines, she and some Chinese. Chinky. Um, so here's, here's, hey, Kyle sees I didn't love it. Yeah, I don't shit. It's not, it's not personal. Listen, you know, you could do better. We know I can do better. You can do better. We can all do better. Kyle sees you can do better. Okay. Maybe just cut down the hyperbole. Yeah. Comedy master. What the fuck dude? Master after three days, that's what they were getting on him for. His podcast was a, uh, there's one clip of him.

Speaker 3:          02:21:00       It's a montage compilation reel for his class. He goes, do you want to make $1 million in your first year of comedy? Oh No, it doesn't say that. Calm seas. Fuck you Kyle seats. Yeah, that's ridiculous. Kyle sees that's bullshit. I know you're a delicate flower. And we all, are you going to be okay, stop doing that. Just do comedy. The last thing that I want to talk about, and this is, this is a sort of a reoccurring theme and um, the, I think one of the reasons why you don't like comedy and one of the reasons why Connolly bothers you is your really fucking good at it. And this is just my own theory. I think when you get really good at anything, you don't feel like you deserve any of what you're doing. And I think when you get to this point where all these people are pointing at you and go, oh, he's fucking awesome, he's the shit and you're the fucking man, and you get these Twitter messages and you're like, ah, okay.

Speaker 3:          02:21:53       It becomes creepy because you know that to be really good at something, to be, to tune into something like you do. Like I'm a fucking comedy kind of sore, right? I've been doing standup comedy for I guess 22 years, 22 years now. I've been doing it and I've been watching it for much longer than that. And you're one of my favorites, so I know that you, you're tuned into it. I know you're tuned doing, do it, but when you're tuned into it and onto the really, in order to really get the energy, the creativity, that in order to really fucking tap into the Muse, you've got to think you're a piece of shit. You've got to think you're not worthy. You got to think that it's all bullshit. You've got to think that we'll fucking different. Who the fuck am I and what is, you can never think you're the shit when these guys get famous.

Speaker 3:          02:22:35       That's what happens. That's why they suck. They get famous and everyone tells them the sh they're the shit and they start thinking they're special and they start thinking they protected and they don't want to dive into the fucking sea of humanity in labs one. It's not funny that true. That's true. Yeah, that's true. Uh, but I, I have to, I will enjoy it more when I can get back to a place where I'm not worried about living up to expectations. Cause I used to fuck off, man. That's in your head dinner like while I'm doing on stage, I'd fuck that Shit's in your head. I think you don't get past those ideas if you just take care of your body a little bit better. There's a lot of stress that comes up to me when I don't exercise. The only energy that's coming, the only like feeling of expectation is all this.

Speaker 3:          02:23:16       There's the performance of the show and the energy, all these people and it's like there's not enough other physical activity going on a lot to pitch me the Joe Rogan comedy workout comedy bootcamp that you too can be powerfully funding. I'm flashlight of partially sponsored by fish. Died not be dicks. No, I mean I, I mean it sounds very cliche and hippie and yoga. I really want to bring this back to my girlfriend habits. I brought you something baby. It's realistic. It's modeled after mine. Say No more. It is your is yours. I'm gonna fuck this vampire mouth. But you can have this fake rubber Dick. That's all you know. Fucking love of fuckers. There's, there's a balance to all of it. And I think we both, we both seek the balance in, in, in, in, in as you're holding this a rubber vagina that's on its period.

Speaker 3:          02:24:08       No, cause I'll fuck with this shit out of a girl in a period. It's like saying something, a rubber band that as big as a house, it's like, yeah, it's realistic, but it's way too big. Go ahead. Um, I think, um, I don't fucking say, all right, let's not deconstruct cotton. Deconstructing comedy. I'm, I'm just trying to say that I think this whole thing is we all do in comedy, it's all about tuning into the idea that's relevant to you. Tuning into the, whatever you're saying on stage that hits you. And a lot of it doesn't. And a lot of it makes them laugh and it doesn't make you laugh and it's like you're trying to find this fucking spot. But it's all the same thing. We're all just trying to like just go, just get to the pure shit, tune into the pure shit, tuned into the pure idea, you know?

Speaker 3:          02:24:48       And then there's always this bag, big battle with yourself when you're doing that, you know there's a big self hate thing and an insecurity thing. And then when you all know those people fucking love you, but you're the same guy when you were shitting your pants, when you're in your car and Oh yeah, I don't have like famous shoes or anything like that. I just, I didn't even famous shoes. [inaudible] do is expectation that his fame though, expectations. A few whom are level, it's not a matter of it doesn't. Fame doesn't have to be worldwide. Shit. Fame can be neighborhood. Fame can fuck you up. You can think you're some phone number that found runaways. Remember the hot whore I said was waiting coke at the fucking

Speaker 1:          02:25:24       show. I'm going to have to do it now. Do it. Do what now? The coke, the coke like, yeah. It's like you gotta get Outta here at six 15 I got rush hour tonight. Ladies and gentlemen, if you're one of the best comics work in the country today, it sounds like

Speaker 3:          02:25:40       fucking Hollywood bullshit. We're blowing smoke up each other's asses, but I really do. I'm glad we're friends and you, you inspire me and I love talking to Ya. And, um, I love what you're doing. I love everything you're doing. I have always, uh, I, I,

Speaker 1:          02:25:53       I mentioned you on the road. All right, this is going nowhere. Now. Every time I go, if I have a talk about fucking and anyone who has kids, I don't have friends that have kids because as soon as they have fucking kids, I don't talk to him anymore. And I'll, I'll always say, except for Joe Rogan, he scares the fuck out of me. I still talk to him. He can have as many kids as he walks. You'd be upset at me if I had kids, but didn't

Speaker 3:          02:26:17       if, uh, if it wasn't an intimidating guy, is that what you're saying

Speaker 1:          02:26:21       about once people have kids, they tend to drift in other directions anyway, and I don't, I was myself

Speaker 3:          02:26:27       before I had kids. I think a lot of people are not themselves. They don't understand. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          02:26:31       Well, they want to incorporate their kids into your, and I fucking despise children. The younger, the worst, like babies. I was fucking terrified. I go, I said to Brian and then this Brian, I like, fuck, am I going to have to look at his baby because I'm going to have to pretend like if I, someone came to my house and I go, these are my dogs and they go, I fucking hate dogs. That would bum me out. So I'm going to have to be do the right thing and look at his kid. But you didn't fucking make me look at the kid. And I think kids are fucking fascinating, man.
