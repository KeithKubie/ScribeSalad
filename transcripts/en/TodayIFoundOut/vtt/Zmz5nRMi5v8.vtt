00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:08.200
We’ve all seen the occasional child playing
football accidentally run the wrong way on

00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:13.150
the field, and if you watch enough T-ball,
you might even occasionally see a kid run

00:00:13.150 --> 00:00:15.480
the wrong way on the base paths.

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:19.390
It turns out, there was once a Major League
Baseball player who did this, only he did

00:00:19.390 --> 00:00:20.390
it on purpose.

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:25.660
The man was Herman “Germany” Schaefer,
who also had other nicknames given to him

00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:28.140
such as “Dutch” and “The Prince”.

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:32.910
Schaefer was a notorious prankster in baseball
who would do things like wear rain coats or

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:37.740
carry a lantern out onto the field during
the game, trying to hint to the umpire that

00:00:37.740 --> 00:00:40.860
they should call the game because of rain
or darkness (more of his zany antics in the

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:41.860
Bonus Facts below).

00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:45.500
One of his more memorable antics was to steal
first base from second (possibly twice, though

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:50.579
there is no documented proof of the first
instance, just a story from a fellow player,

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:51.579
Davy Jones.)

00:00:51.579 --> 00:00:55.980
Schaefer is the only known person to ever
steal first in a Major League game and will

00:00:55.980 --> 00:01:01.360
remain so, because, probably due to Schaefer,
a new rule was written shortly after his death

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:07.060
at the age of 42 in 1919 from a “brain hemorrhage”
and complications due to tuberculosis.

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:11.799
Rule 52, Section 2, which is now Rule 7.08i:

00:01:11.799 --> 00:01:15.700
After he has acquired legal possession of
a base, [if] he runs the bases in reverse

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:20.329
order for the purpose of confusing the defense
or making a travesty of the game… [the]

00:01:20.329 --> 00:01:24.539
umpire shall immediately call “Time” and
declare the runner out…

00:01:24.539 --> 00:01:28.820
The supposed first instance of Schaefer stealing
first, according to Davy Jones, occurred in

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:33.639
a game against Cleveland around 1908, with
the exact date unknown.

00:01:33.639 --> 00:01:38.889
With a runner on third late in the game, Schaefer
stole second hoping to draw a throw from the

00:01:38.889 --> 00:01:43.060
catcher so that the runner on third, Davy
Jones, could try and steal home.

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:47.009
Jones gave the following account of what happened
next in The Glory of Their Times, by Larry

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:48.009
Ritter:

00:01:48.009 --> 00:01:50.310
So now we had men on second and third.

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:53.740
Well, on the next pitch Schaefer yelled, ‘Let’s
try it again!’

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:58.880
And with a blood-curdling shout he took off
like a wild Indian back to first base, and

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:01.359
dove in headfirst in a cloud of dust.

00:02:01.359 --> 00:02:04.689
He figured the catcher might throw to first
— since he evidently wouldn’t throw to

00:02:04.689 --> 00:02:08.149
second — and then I would come home same
as before.

00:02:08.149 --> 00:02:09.149
But nothing happened.

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:10.490
Nothing at all.

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:14.940
Everybody just stood there and watched Schaefer,
with their mouths open, not knowing what the

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:15.940
devil was going on.

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:18.720
The umpires were just as confused as everybody
else.

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:22.110
However, it turned out that at that time there
wasn’t any rule against a guy going from

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:26.329
second back to first, if that’s the way
he wanted to play baseball, so they had to

00:02:26.329 --> 00:02:27.549
let it stand.

00:02:27.549 --> 00:02:31.580
So there we were, back where we started, with
Schaefer on first and me on third.

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:36.040
And on the next pitch, darned if he didn’t
let out another war whoop and take off again

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:37.180
for second base.

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:41.739
By this time the Cleveland catcher evidently
had enough, because he finally threw to second

00:02:41.739 --> 00:02:46.420
to get Schaefer, and when he did I took off
for home and both of us were safe.

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:51.360
On August 4, 1911, Schaefer, playing for the
Washington Senators, pulled the same stunt

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:55.920
with less success, but at least this time
documented in the newspapers.

00:02:55.920 --> 00:03:00.280
In this instance, it was the bottom of the
ninth with a similar situation as above.

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:04.750
There was a runner, Clyde Milan, on third
who represented the winning run of the game

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:07.640
(it was tied 0-0), and Schaefer on first.

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:11.730
Schaefer broke for second and made it, but
this failed to illicit a throw from White

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:16.561
Sox catcher Fred Payne, as you might expect
in the bottom of the ninth in a 0-0 tie where

00:03:16.561 --> 00:03:20.810
a runner on second is meaningless to the outcome
of the game when there is already a runner

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:21.810
on third.

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:25.700
On the very next pitch Schaefer stole first,
again without drawing a throw.

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:29.310
This brought the skipper of the White Sox,
Hugh Duffy, out to argue with the umpires

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:30.969
about allowing Schaefer to do this.

00:03:30.969 --> 00:03:35.620
While Duffy was still arguing with umpire
Tommy Connolly, Schaefer broke for second,

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:39.041
this time getting caught in a run-down, at
which point Milan tried to steal home, but

00:03:39.041 --> 00:03:41.000
was thrown out ending the inning.

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:45.200
Not to be dissuaded, Schaefer argued with
the umpire that this shouldn’t have counted

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:49.359
because at the time of the play, the White
Sox had ten team members on the field, though

00:03:49.359 --> 00:03:52.379
of course Hugh Duffy hadn’t played in a
game since 1908.

00:03:52.379 --> 00:03:56.470
The umpires didn’t listen to his arguments
and ruled that the play stood, as did his

00:03:56.470 --> 00:04:00.519
steal from second to first base because, at
the time, there was no rule against it.

00:04:00.519 --> 00:04:04.849
The Senators went on to win the game 1-0 anyway.

00:04:04.849 --> 00:04:08.690
Besides using raincoats to try to get games
called because of rain, Schaefer was also

00:04:08.690 --> 00:04:13.969
known to occasionally wear galoshes and sometimes
to also bring an umbrella out, on at least

00:04:13.969 --> 00:04:19.060
one instance even up to bat as if he was going
to use it to bat.

00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:23.420
One of the instances where he wore a raincoat
got him ejected from the game.

00:04:23.420 --> 00:04:27.450
Another antic that got him ejected once was
wearing an extremely fake bushy black moustache

00:04:27.450 --> 00:04:28.450
up to bat.

00:04:28.450 --> 00:04:32.161
Generally, though, umpires gave Schaefer a
lot of rope before they’d eject him, as

00:04:32.161 --> 00:04:37.450
reported in Sporting Life in 1912: “Schaefer
is such a hit with the crowds that the umpires

00:04:37.450 --> 00:04:41.560
are giving him every liberty to do as he pleases.”

00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:45.720
After hitting a home run out of Columbia Park
in Philadelphia, Schaefer chose to carry his

00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:49.871
bat around the bases with him acting as if
it was a gun and that he was shooting the

00:04:49.871 --> 00:04:52.700
pitcher Rube Waddell with it.

00:04:52.700 --> 00:04:57.840
On June 24, 1906, Schaefer supposedly called
his shot (again a story from Davy Jones, but

00:04:57.840 --> 00:05:01.390
at least this time it can be verified that
Schaefer did hit the home run).

00:05:01.390 --> 00:05:05.770
With the Tigers down by one run with two outs
in the ninth, Schaefer supposedly yelled “Ladies

00:05:05.770 --> 00:05:10.310
and gentlemen, you are now looking at Herman
Schaefer, better known as ‘Herman the Great,’

00:05:10.310 --> 00:05:13.280
acknowledged by one and all to be the greatest
pinch-hitter in the world.

00:05:13.280 --> 00:05:17.170
I am now going to hit the ball into the left
field bleachers.

00:05:17.170 --> 00:05:18.170
Thank you.”

00:05:18.170 --> 00:05:23.380
This was quite a claim from a player who at
that point only had 2 home runs in his career.

00:05:23.380 --> 00:05:26.410
Schaefer then hit the first pitch off of Doc
White into the left field bleachers.

00:05:26.410 --> 00:05:27.410
This is where his showmanship really kicked
in.

00:05:27.410 --> 00:05:32.280
Rather than just trot around the bases, Schaefer
made diving, headfirst slides into each base.

00:05:32.280 --> 00:05:34.650
This all was recorded in newspapers at the
time.

00:05:34.650 --> 00:05:38.650
Davy Jones went on to say that after getting
up from each base, Schaefer had called out

00:05:38.650 --> 00:05:43.050
his progress as if he was in a horse race,
though few in the audience could hear him.

00:05:43.050 --> 00:05:46.970
“At the half, Schaefer leads by a length!…
Schaefer leads by a mile!… Schaefer wins

00:05:46.970 --> 00:05:51.540
by a nose!” Jones said that after diving
into home Schaefer stood up and called out,

00:05:51.540 --> 00:05:54.890
“Ladies and Gentlemen, this concludes this
afternoon’s performance.

00:05:54.890 --> 00:05:57.350
I thank you for your kind attention.”

00:05:57.350 --> 00:06:00.430
This sort of thing wasn’t that rare for
Schaefer, who liked to tell people he was

00:06:00.430 --> 00:06:04.520
psychic, and would often try to predict what
was about to happen on the field.

00:06:04.520 --> 00:06:08.700
Most of the time, he was wrong, but, of course,
as the late great Hall of Fame baseball announcer

00:06:08.700 --> 00:06:14.030
Dave Niehaus use to say “Nobody remembers
those times, they only remember when you’re

00:06:14.030 --> 00:06:15.030
right”.

00:06:15.030 --> 00:06:21.100
Another common off-the-field antic of Schaefer,
recalled by Ty Cobb, was Schaefer’s practice

00:06:21.100 --> 00:06:24.601
of holding running conversations with strangers
on the street, while continuing to walk as

00:06:24.601 --> 00:06:30.400
he passed them and conversed, such that at
the end of it, both he and the stranger would

00:06:30.400 --> 00:06:34.110
have to be screaming at the top of their lungs
to hear each other from so far away.

00:06:34.110 --> 00:06:38.610
Trying to be polite, most people would continue
on with the conversation until this happened.

00:06:38.610 --> 00:06:43.040
As Cobb stated, at the end “all street traffic
would have stopped to listen open-mouthed

00:06:43.040 --> 00:06:47.591
to the dialogue and Germany never considered
the stunt a complete success unless he still

00:06:47.591 --> 00:06:52.780
had the mother screeching answers when we
were half a block away.”

00:06:52.780 --> 00:06:59.350
In October of 1914, Schaefer randomly showed
up in Court to defend some homeless drunkards

00:06:59.350 --> 00:07:01.110
who were to be charged that day.

00:07:01.110 --> 00:07:04.470
His principle argument was that “these poor
souls should not be sentenced to 30 days in

00:07:04.470 --> 00:07:08.460
jail for an offense that a millionaire would
be sent home in a cab for.”

00:07:08.460 --> 00:07:10.920
The judge sided with Schaefer and let the
drunkards go.

00:07:10.920 --> 00:07:14.540
Schaefer then took them all out to dinner.

00:07:14.540 --> 00:07:18.210
About what he’d do after retiring from baseball
(which he never got the chance to do, because

00:07:18.210 --> 00:07:22.300
of his early death while still a scout), Schaefer
once said in an interview he’d like to buy

00:07:22.300 --> 00:07:27.550
a saloon, “Not a big gaudy place, but a
cozy spot where my friends can enjoy a glass

00:07:27.550 --> 00:07:29.710
of beer and a sociable evening.

00:07:29.710 --> 00:07:33.650
And along about 10 o’clock every evening
I want one of my pals to say to the bartender

00:07:33.650 --> 00:07:36.250
on duty, ‘Where’s old Schaef tonight?’

00:07:36.250 --> 00:07:57.120
And I want my bartender to be able to say,
‘He’s upstairs, drunk.'”
