00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:01.580
In computer architecture,

00:00:01.580 --> 00:00:05.290
we are interested in the locality
property of memory references.

00:00:05.290 --> 00:00:09.750
If we know that the processor has
accessed the address x recently,

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:15.000
the locality principle says that it is
likely to access the same address again

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:16.230
in the near future.

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:20.790
And, it is likely to access
addresses close to x, too.

00:00:20.790 --> 00:00:24.440
This is what we call temporal locality.

00:00:24.440 --> 00:00:28.760
Once we access an address we are likely
to access the same address again.

00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:31.830
This is what we call spatial locality.

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:36.180
If we access an address, we are likely
to access nearby addresses so on.
