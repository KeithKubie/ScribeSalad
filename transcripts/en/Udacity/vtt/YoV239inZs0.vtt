00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:02.650
So, since we are talking about use case diagrams, I also want

00:00:02.650 --> 00:00:05.593
to ask you, what are use case diagrams used for? So, what

00:00:05.593 --> 00:00:08.600
are they good for? Why are they useful within a software process?

00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:12.130
Also in this case, I'm providing several possible answers. They are not really

00:00:12.130 --> 00:00:15.420
used for anything. Or, they can be used to prioritize requirements. Or,

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:18.220
maybe they can be used for user interface design. They can be

00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:20.280
used during requirements elicitation. They can

00:00:20.280 --> 00:00:21.890
be used for code optimization. And

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:25.570
finally, they can be used for test case design. Also, in this case,

00:00:25.570 --> 00:00:28.650
I would like you to mark all the answers that you think are correct.
