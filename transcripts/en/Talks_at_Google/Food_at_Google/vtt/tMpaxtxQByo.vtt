[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:05.454 --> 00:00:07.370
LYZELLE CARREON: Thanks,
everyone, for coming.

00:00:07.370 --> 00:00:09.350
We'll get started.

00:00:09.350 --> 00:00:12.350
I'm Lyzelle, I'm part of
the Asian Google Network.

00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:18.860
And I'm here with Chris Cheung,
who was born and raised here

00:00:18.860 --> 00:00:19.490
in New York.

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:20.970
He's a renown chef.

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:25.490
He is the owner of East
Wind Snack Shop in Brooklyn

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:28.100
and is now also
the Executive Chef

00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:33.020
Partner of the newly-opened
Tansuo restaurant in Nashville.

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:37.050
And he's obviously the
cook of the delicious food

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:39.320
that you're eating,
which is the--

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:42.380
CHRIS CHEUNG: It's cucumber
salad with crispy shallots

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:43.430
and sesame.

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:48.014
It's with chicken and vinegar.

00:00:48.014 --> 00:00:49.680
LYZELLE CARREON: And
also, in Truck Pit,

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:51.890
if you guys haven't
gone there already,

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:54.380
there are the baos, his--

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:57.770
CHRIS CHEUNG: So yeah, we do,
at East Wind, a pork belly bao.

00:00:57.770 --> 00:01:01.155
So it's slow braised
pork belly with pickles.

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:08.870
Yeah, we have that at East
Wind, so I had the chefs here

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:12.554
do it on their own for
Google, so it's pretty cool.

00:01:12.554 --> 00:01:13.470
LYZELLE CARREON: Yeah.

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:15.851
So we can all eat that
after if you have already.

00:01:15.851 --> 00:01:16.351
Awesome!

00:01:16.351 --> 00:01:18.090
So thanks for being here, Chris!

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:18.920
CHRIS CHEUNG: Thanks
for having me.

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:20.360
LYZELLE CARREON: We're excited
to get to know you better

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:23.260
and learn more about your
success in the food scene.

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:26.016
CHRIS CHEUNG: Yeah, anything
I can help you with on that,

00:01:26.016 --> 00:01:26.967
sure.

00:01:26.967 --> 00:01:27.800
LYZELLE CARREON: OK.

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:29.220
So let's jump right in.

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:31.730
Let's talk about East Wind
and the East Wind Snack Shop.

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:33.890
What inspired you to
open the restaurant?

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:37.310
CHRIS CHEUNG: OK, so when I was
a kid, I grew up in Chinatown.

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:39.740
And in Chinatown, there
were these little coffee

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:43.730
shops, these little tea houses
that really served the working

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:47.780
class of Chinatown--
so lots of lunches,

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:51.230
meat over rice, baos,
dumplings-- and that's

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:52.220
what I lived off of.

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:56.210
And so when the space
came up for East Wind,

00:01:56.210 --> 00:01:58.220
it was so reminiscent
of those coffee

00:01:58.220 --> 00:02:01.850
shops and those teahouses, it
brought me back to my childhood

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:04.940
and then I was inspired
to kind of recreate

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:07.690
a modern version of that.

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:11.466
And so that's how that took
off, so that was pretty cool.

00:02:11.466 --> 00:02:14.090
LYZELLE CARREON: And East Wind's
been open for about two years,

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:14.350
now?

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:15.750
CHRIS CHEUNG: Yeah, a
little over two years.

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:17.666
LYZELLE CARREON: What
do you love about owning

00:02:17.666 --> 00:02:18.920
the restaurant and cooking?

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:22.040
CHRIS CHEUNG: Well, when
you own your own place,

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:24.830
you get to obviously
call your own shots.

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:29.720
You can forge a path from
your own creative juices

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:33.500
and really control your
own destiny on that.

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:37.700
It's also a really cool
feeling when it's successful.

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:42.530
So that's one of the benefits,
because doing business in New

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:46.680
York is extremely difficult.

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:49.170
LYZELLE CARREON: What are
your most popular dishes?

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:50.940
CHRIS CHEUNG: So we
have a few dishes.

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:53.820
It's a very small menu, it's
about eight items on the menu.

00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:58.590
And so when I first started
cooking at East Wind,

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:01.020
we did dumplings--
and we still do--

00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:06.970
and we get a lot of great
things said about our dumplings.

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:08.910
So I spent the first--

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:11.710
I still do it, I chase
the perfect dumpling.

00:03:11.710 --> 00:03:18.210
So I try to cook every dumpling
with the technique in mind

00:03:18.210 --> 00:03:20.250
to make sure that that
dumpling is great,

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:24.960
and that goes from everywhere
from making our own dough,

00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:29.100
grinding our own meat,
folding those doughs by hand

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:33.590
from scratch every day,
doing the dumplings by batch

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:37.500
every day so we only
have enough by par--

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:40.050
and when it runs
out it runs out--

00:03:40.050 --> 00:03:41.880
and we cook each one to order.

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:46.710
So a lot of work goes into the
juicy pork dumplings, which

00:03:46.710 --> 00:03:48.940
is probably my best seller.

00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:55.830
The dry aged beef pot
stickers are pretty well

00:03:55.830 --> 00:03:58.180
received by the
critics in New York.

00:03:58.180 --> 00:04:00.450
And then I do this pork
belly bun, which I told you

00:04:00.450 --> 00:04:02.000
you'll have a little later on.

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:03.500
LYZELLE CARREON:
Do you think you've

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:05.700
got the perfect dumpling?

00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:08.220
CHRIS CHEUNG: You know, cooking
is variable from day to day

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:12.240
and sometimes you get
that one that you cook,

00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:14.019
that one that was
like, that's so great,

00:04:14.019 --> 00:04:15.060
but it's fleeting, right?

00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:17.550
So then you serve it and
it's gone, and you know,

00:04:17.550 --> 00:04:18.870
you left it to keep cooking.

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:23.340
So that's I call it
chasing, it's always

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:26.610
difficult to keep doing it
under variable conditions,

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:31.467
but it's about giving it your
best effort every single time.

00:04:31.467 --> 00:04:33.800
LYZELLE CARREON: And do you
have any personal favorites?

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:34.591
CHRIS CHEUNG: Yeah.

00:04:34.591 --> 00:04:36.750
So the juicy pork
dumpling, like you said,

00:04:36.750 --> 00:04:40.890
when we first started it, it
went through a few iterations

00:04:40.890 --> 00:04:45.870
and I just made a decision to
really just cook everything

00:04:45.870 --> 00:04:48.810
from scratch and do everything
by the day, and it really,

00:04:48.810 --> 00:04:51.390
really makes a difference.

00:04:51.390 --> 00:04:56.640
You get proud of the product
when you see it comes out

00:04:56.640 --> 00:04:58.387
the way you want it.

00:04:58.387 --> 00:05:00.220
LYZELLE CARREON: So if
you don't know Chris,

00:05:00.220 --> 00:05:02.940
he's pretty much a TV star now.

00:05:02.940 --> 00:05:06.120
Can you tell us about some
of the shows you've been on?

00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:08.160
CHRIS CHEUNG: Yeah,
so, you know--

00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:09.430
TV star?

00:05:09.430 --> 00:05:11.750
I'm trying.

00:05:11.750 --> 00:05:13.000
LYZELLE CARREON: So modest.

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:15.030
CHRIS CHEUNG: I happened
to get a lot of--

00:05:15.030 --> 00:05:17.940
there's my mic.

00:05:17.940 --> 00:05:20.040
Sorry, guys.

00:05:20.040 --> 00:05:22.570
Just leave that there.

00:05:22.570 --> 00:05:26.380
I happen to had the pleasure to
be on a few really good shows.

00:05:26.380 --> 00:05:30.190
Martha Stewart's show,
was a judge on "Chopped."

00:05:30.190 --> 00:05:34.150
I was on one of the early
food competition shows done

00:05:34.150 --> 00:05:37.630
by the Food Network, and that
was "The Next Great Chef,"

00:05:37.630 --> 00:05:39.970
and I got to battle
Sean Brock, who

00:05:39.970 --> 00:05:42.460
is a nationally acclaimed
chef who happens to actually

00:05:42.460 --> 00:05:44.540
have a restaurant in
Nashville as well,

00:05:44.540 --> 00:05:49.810
so it's going to be cool meeting
him later on down the line.

00:05:49.810 --> 00:05:53.020
I've also done the
Anthony Bourdain

00:05:53.020 --> 00:05:57.030
show, "No Reservations,"
which was really, really cool.

00:05:57.030 --> 00:06:00.210
LYZELLE CARREON: Is that the
most interesting and memorable?

00:06:00.210 --> 00:06:03.970
CHRIS CHEUNG: That one
happens to be the one that's

00:06:03.970 --> 00:06:05.110
helped my career the most.

00:06:05.110 --> 00:06:08.200
So Anthony Bourdain
is a mega star

00:06:08.200 --> 00:06:12.760
and I had the pleasure of taking
him on a tour of all three

00:06:12.760 --> 00:06:15.730
Chinatowns in New York City.

00:06:15.730 --> 00:06:19.390
One in Flushing,
dim sum in Brooklyn,

00:06:19.390 --> 00:06:22.720
and then Hop Kee in Manhattan,
in Manhattan's Chinatown.

00:06:22.720 --> 00:06:29.840
And so yeah, it is really,
really cool to have been--

00:06:29.840 --> 00:06:36.404
think I did four spots
over two episodes

00:06:36.404 --> 00:06:38.320
and then helped them on
another episode, which

00:06:38.320 --> 00:06:40.034
I was behind the camera.

00:06:40.034 --> 00:06:40.534
Yep.

00:06:40.534 --> 00:06:41.950
LYZELLE CARREON:
I personally want

00:06:41.950 --> 00:06:44.080
to know, what's it like
to work with Anthony?

00:06:44.080 --> 00:06:45.070
What's he really like?

00:06:45.070 --> 00:06:46.611
CHRIS CHEUNG: OK,
so Anthony Bourdain

00:06:46.611 --> 00:06:49.490
is the same exact guy off
camera as he is on camera.

00:06:49.490 --> 00:06:51.340
He's very sharp witted.

00:06:51.340 --> 00:06:55.090
And the work involved
in doing his show

00:06:55.090 --> 00:06:59.950
is the easiest thing you'll
ever do if you ever do food TV.

00:06:59.950 --> 00:07:05.440
You sit with him, you drink,
you get drunk, you eat a lot,

00:07:05.440 --> 00:07:07.120
and then you talk about food.

00:07:07.120 --> 00:07:09.870
And then he cracks his jokes.

00:07:09.870 --> 00:07:12.430
And then you get on
national TV for doing it,

00:07:12.430 --> 00:07:13.552
so it was pretty cool.

00:07:13.552 --> 00:07:14.701
LYZELLE CARREON: Nice.

00:07:14.701 --> 00:07:16.450
So when you're not in
front of the camera,

00:07:16.450 --> 00:07:18.730
what's a day in the
life of Chris' life?

00:07:18.730 --> 00:07:22.240
CHRIS CHEUNG: OK, so lately,
it's been pretty hectic.

00:07:22.240 --> 00:07:23.300
I have two restaurants.

00:07:23.300 --> 00:07:28.450
So East Wind is
located in Brooklyn

00:07:28.450 --> 00:07:31.870
and it happens to be three
blocks away from my house.

00:07:31.870 --> 00:07:37.397
So over my career, it has been
the quickest, easiest commute

00:07:37.397 --> 00:07:38.980
that I've ever had
to work, and we all

00:07:38.980 --> 00:07:43.150
know, living and working in New
York, how crazy that can be.

00:07:43.150 --> 00:07:48.170
So my next move is to open a
restaurant 1,000 miles away.

00:07:48.170 --> 00:07:52.630
And so it's a lot of going
back and forth from restaurant

00:07:52.630 --> 00:07:55.650
to restaurant, heading
to the airport,

00:07:55.650 --> 00:07:57.880
and then the rest of the
day, the rest of the time

00:07:57.880 --> 00:08:02.424
is trying to spend as much
time with my family as I can.

00:08:02.424 --> 00:08:03.840
LYZELLE CARREON:
So speaking about

00:08:03.840 --> 00:08:07.430
interesting and memorable, tell
us about the Asian Food Mafia.

00:08:07.430 --> 00:08:08.940
That's a memorable, catchy name.

00:08:08.940 --> 00:08:09.680
What is it?

00:08:09.680 --> 00:08:13.040
CHRIS CHEUNG: OK, so Asian
Food Mafia is a group of chefs

00:08:13.040 --> 00:08:16.340
that I've formed together.

00:08:16.340 --> 00:08:21.470
We all are Asian, we all own
or run our own restaurants.

00:08:21.470 --> 00:08:24.780
Currently, the
roster goes from me,

00:08:24.780 --> 00:08:29.930
Doron Wong of Northern Tiger,
Chef Bao Bao of Baoburg,

00:08:29.930 --> 00:08:36.870
Medwin Pang of Hunger Pang,
Lien Lin of Bricolage,

00:08:36.870 --> 00:08:40.820
Pichet Ong, Jonathan
Wu of Fung Tu

00:08:40.820 --> 00:08:43.850
is pretty much the
core of our group.

00:08:43.850 --> 00:08:47.600
And we basically get
together once a month,

00:08:47.600 --> 00:08:53.930
hang out, eat, drink,
rant about the industry,

00:08:53.930 --> 00:08:56.120
talk shop and go over problems.

00:08:56.120 --> 00:09:00.530
And then we've also started to
get into some community events

00:09:00.530 --> 00:09:01.582
as well.

00:09:01.582 --> 00:09:03.540
LYZELLE CARREON: What
kind of community events?

00:09:03.540 --> 00:09:08.870
CHRIS CHEUNG: So we're trying
to shape the way Asian food is

00:09:08.870 --> 00:09:11.150
perceived, especially
in New York,

00:09:11.150 --> 00:09:14.420
and trying to do our best,
our thing for the community.

00:09:14.420 --> 00:09:18.470
We've done one event for the
Museum of Chinese in America

00:09:18.470 --> 00:09:22.170
and we did a panel discussion
about the past, present,

00:09:22.170 --> 00:09:24.850
and future of Asian cuisine.

00:09:24.850 --> 00:09:31.370
And that was to help the museum
as well as get our word out.

00:09:31.370 --> 00:09:33.419
And we're doing
an upcoming event

00:09:33.419 --> 00:09:35.460
where we're going to have
a collaborative dinner,

00:09:35.460 --> 00:09:38.000
so watch out for that.

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:41.510
I'm really excited to
cook alongside of all

00:09:41.510 --> 00:09:43.340
those great chefs,
and we're going

00:09:43.340 --> 00:09:46.220
to do it at Fung Tu in
the Lower East Side.

00:09:46.220 --> 00:09:47.870
So probably in a
couple of months,

00:09:47.870 --> 00:09:49.190
we'll make that announcement.

00:09:49.190 --> 00:09:51.440
LYZELLE CARREON: Oh, cool.

00:09:51.440 --> 00:09:57.050
So with the Asian
Food Mafia, what

00:09:57.050 --> 00:10:00.040
are some of the challenges
you and the Mafia

00:10:00.040 --> 00:10:03.212
have faced as Asian
American chefs starting

00:10:03.212 --> 00:10:04.170
a business in New York?

00:10:04.170 --> 00:10:05.720
And running a
business in New York?

00:10:05.720 --> 00:10:07.178
CHRIS CHEUNG: Yeah,
so there's lots

00:10:07.178 --> 00:10:09.590
of challenges to running
businesses in New York.

00:10:09.590 --> 00:10:14.720
I'm not too sure if
it's indicative of just

00:10:14.720 --> 00:10:17.390
Asian American chefs
per se, running

00:10:17.390 --> 00:10:20.739
a small business in New
York is extremely difficult.

00:10:20.739 --> 00:10:23.030
It's extremely hard and New
York does not make it easy,

00:10:23.030 --> 00:10:25.405
so, you know, the saying goes,
if you could make it here,

00:10:25.405 --> 00:10:27.110
you can make it anywhere.

00:10:27.110 --> 00:10:29.430
That's 100% true.

00:10:29.430 --> 00:10:32.360
There are so many things that--

00:10:32.360 --> 00:10:35.510
owning a business in New York--

00:10:35.510 --> 00:10:36.850
they make you go through.

00:10:36.850 --> 00:10:41.210
A lot of it may be
unnecessary, but overall,

00:10:41.210 --> 00:10:46.100
it's really, really
difficult. So as Asian chefs,

00:10:46.100 --> 00:10:50.330
together, we're able to
tackle some of the challenges.

00:10:50.330 --> 00:10:56.750
Like staffing, if one of
us is looking for cooks,

00:10:56.750 --> 00:10:59.150
we can always go to
each other and see

00:10:59.150 --> 00:11:01.790
if there's any referrals out.

00:11:01.790 --> 00:11:05.930
If my dishwasher
doesn't come in,

00:11:05.930 --> 00:11:07.820
I can always ask to
borrow a dishwasher

00:11:07.820 --> 00:11:10.280
from one of the other chefs.

00:11:10.280 --> 00:11:13.430
So strength in numbers
makes it a lot easier

00:11:13.430 --> 00:11:16.910
for us to get just
the basics of the day.

00:11:16.910 --> 00:11:18.390
You know?

00:11:18.390 --> 00:11:20.015
LYZELLE CARREON:
Earlier you mentioned,

00:11:20.015 --> 00:11:23.080
when you were talking,
that some places don't want

00:11:23.080 --> 00:11:26.810
an Asian kind of restaurant?

00:11:26.810 --> 00:11:30.410
CHRIS CHEUNG: Well,
some of the challenges

00:11:30.410 --> 00:11:32.740
happen to be on a little
bit of a higher scale.

00:11:32.740 --> 00:11:38.210
I've, as an Asian American
opening Chinese restaurants

00:11:38.210 --> 00:11:41.660
or Asian restaurants, I've
encountered real estate

00:11:41.660 --> 00:11:46.640
companies who tell me their
landlords do not want Asian

00:11:46.640 --> 00:11:48.680
restaurants or Chinese
restaurants for whatever

00:11:48.680 --> 00:11:50.630
reason-- the smell of food--

00:11:50.630 --> 00:11:52.680
anywhere near their
community or their block, so

00:11:52.680 --> 00:11:56.360
it's really tough to
hear when that happens.

00:11:56.360 --> 00:11:58.040
But I take it on the chin.

00:11:58.040 --> 00:12:00.530
Sometimes the best
deal is no deal.

00:12:00.530 --> 00:12:03.620
I don't want to be anywhere
where I'm not wanted,

00:12:03.620 --> 00:12:07.820
and so I'll look
at other options.

00:12:07.820 --> 00:12:10.430
But still, it is a tough thing
to hear when you hear something

00:12:10.430 --> 00:12:11.260
like that for sure.

00:12:14.076 --> 00:12:15.950
LYZELLE CARREON: Going
into a little bit more

00:12:15.950 --> 00:12:17.980
of your community
involvement, how--

00:12:17.980 --> 00:12:20.620
or just the community
at large, how have you

00:12:20.620 --> 00:12:23.390
seen the Chinese or
Asian-American community

00:12:23.390 --> 00:12:25.860
changing over the years since
you've been and raised here.

00:12:25.860 --> 00:12:28.234
CHRIS CHEUNG: It's changed
and grown immensely.

00:12:28.234 --> 00:12:29.650
When I was a kid
growing up, there

00:12:29.650 --> 00:12:34.960
was one community that
represented Asia in general,

00:12:34.960 --> 00:12:37.230
and that was
Chinatown Manhattan--

00:12:37.230 --> 00:12:39.880
Mott Street, L Street,
Bayard Street--

00:12:39.880 --> 00:12:42.680
and it started to
grow from there.

00:12:42.680 --> 00:12:45.640
As I got a little
older, the joke

00:12:45.640 --> 00:12:49.060
was, Chinatown was kind of
taking over all of downtown New

00:12:49.060 --> 00:12:50.290
York, right?

00:12:50.290 --> 00:12:52.630
After September 11th,
that kind of changed

00:12:52.630 --> 00:12:54.760
and Chinatown started shrinking.

00:12:54.760 --> 00:12:58.780
But what happened was, more
Chinatowns started to open up

00:12:58.780 --> 00:13:01.540
across the cities-- there's
like three in Brooklyn,

00:13:01.540 --> 00:13:04.090
there's the huge one
in Flushing, Queens--

00:13:04.090 --> 00:13:07.900
and the difference
is, when I was a kid,

00:13:07.900 --> 00:13:10.210
it was really mostly
Chinese people

00:13:10.210 --> 00:13:13.930
from Hong Kong, Taishan,
the Guangdong area of China.

00:13:13.930 --> 00:13:18.250
And now that diversity
from all areas of China--

00:13:18.250 --> 00:13:21.520
and then you also have a
lot of people from Southeast

00:13:21.520 --> 00:13:22.870
Asia coming in, too.

00:13:22.870 --> 00:13:26.740
So for me, it's really great,
because there's so much more

00:13:26.740 --> 00:13:29.114
different food to try.

00:13:29.114 --> 00:13:30.530
LYZELLE CARREON:
What do you think

00:13:30.530 --> 00:13:34.130
are some of the biggest
challenges our communities are

00:13:34.130 --> 00:13:35.800
facing at the moment?

00:13:35.800 --> 00:13:40.820
CHRIS CHEUNG: Well, obviously
in today's political climate,

00:13:40.820 --> 00:13:43.940
the immigrant journey seems
to be a little bit tougher

00:13:43.940 --> 00:13:46.340
and there's lot more
challenges to face.

00:13:50.060 --> 00:13:53.540
It's really just about
chasing the American dream.

00:13:53.540 --> 00:13:57.980
I remember when I was
a kid and my mother--

00:13:57.980 --> 00:14:01.420
we were poor and just
trying to make ends meet.

00:14:01.420 --> 00:14:05.300
The longer you're here, the
more generations you're here,

00:14:05.300 --> 00:14:06.920
it seems to get a
little bit better

00:14:06.920 --> 00:14:09.960
and you seem to have a little
bit more of a advantage.

00:14:09.960 --> 00:14:13.820
So I think education
will help that and just

00:14:13.820 --> 00:14:16.490
putting your head down
and working hard also

00:14:16.490 --> 00:14:19.050
goes a long way too.

00:14:19.050 --> 00:14:22.466
LYZELLE CARREON: I think
we can all attest to that.

00:14:22.466 --> 00:14:23.340
CHRIS CHEUNG: Yeah.

00:14:23.340 --> 00:14:24.715
LYZELLE CARREON:
But where do you

00:14:24.715 --> 00:14:28.280
see the community going next?

00:14:28.280 --> 00:14:35.270
CHRIS CHEUNG: Well, you know,
bigger, better, more diversity.

00:14:35.270 --> 00:14:37.470
A more stronger voice.

00:14:37.470 --> 00:14:45.650
And I think that in the case of
the Asian community in general,

00:14:45.650 --> 00:14:49.880
being on a more united
front would definitely help.

00:14:49.880 --> 00:14:53.500
It seems like, this
Thai community,

00:14:53.500 --> 00:14:56.170
this Chinese community,
there is Korean community,

00:14:56.170 --> 00:14:58.370
and they all have
their own agendas,

00:14:58.370 --> 00:15:00.020
but if you take
a couple of steps

00:15:00.020 --> 00:15:03.230
back and kind of look at the
picture through a wider angle,

00:15:03.230 --> 00:15:08.540
being more united because a
lot of the people who are not

00:15:08.540 --> 00:15:13.550
on the Asian side tend
to look at Asians--

00:15:13.550 --> 00:15:14.990
hence the word Asia, right?

00:15:14.990 --> 00:15:20.000
So I used to hate the word
Asian food, or Asian cuisine,

00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:22.760
because, really, there
is no Asian cuisine--

00:15:22.760 --> 00:15:24.770
Korean food is
definitely different

00:15:24.770 --> 00:15:29.510
than Thai; Thai is definitely
different from Chinese--

00:15:29.510 --> 00:15:32.630
you get tend to
put into one group.

00:15:32.630 --> 00:15:35.540
It's good to put that
perception-- make that lemons

00:15:35.540 --> 00:15:38.810
into lemonade, and try to
be more in a united front,

00:15:38.810 --> 00:15:42.680
because we all kind of have
the same concerns trying to be

00:15:42.680 --> 00:15:44.930
successful in this country.

00:15:44.930 --> 00:15:47.084
LYZELLE CARREON: Those
are great points, I think.

00:15:47.084 --> 00:15:48.500
We would like to
know, what do you

00:15:48.500 --> 00:15:50.690
think Google could do
to help the advancement

00:15:50.690 --> 00:15:52.400
of the community
and all the things

00:15:52.400 --> 00:15:53.250
that you mentioned
about united front?

00:15:53.250 --> 00:15:55.520
CHRIS CHEUNG: Yeah, so I
got a good one for that.

00:15:55.520 --> 00:15:58.040
Checking out the Google
Translator, right?

00:15:58.040 --> 00:16:03.050
So if the Google
Translator can be developed

00:16:03.050 --> 00:16:05.120
to where it hits
a home run 100%,

00:16:05.120 --> 00:16:08.570
I think, especially with the
tonal languages, which Chinese

00:16:08.570 --> 00:16:13.970
definitely is, it would be one
language for the whole world,

00:16:13.970 --> 00:16:17.270
but we all still get to
keep our cultural identity.

00:16:17.270 --> 00:16:20.000
And I think that that would be
a game changer for the world

00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:20.810
if that was happen.

00:16:20.810 --> 00:16:23.060
LYZELLE CARREON: Does anyone
work on Google Translator

00:16:23.060 --> 00:16:24.008
know anyone?

00:16:24.008 --> 00:16:26.380
Know anyone that does?

00:16:26.380 --> 00:16:28.161
OK.

00:16:28.161 --> 00:16:30.410
Now let's open up the floor
to see if the audience has

00:16:30.410 --> 00:16:31.050
any questions.

00:16:31.050 --> 00:16:32.010
There's a mic there.

00:16:32.010 --> 00:16:34.295
I can also hand my
mic over if anyone

00:16:34.295 --> 00:16:36.530
has any questions for Chris?

00:16:46.070 --> 00:16:48.090
AUDIENCE: Hello,
thank you for coming.

00:16:48.090 --> 00:16:49.250
I have two questions.

00:16:49.250 --> 00:16:53.350
So one of my questions is, how
do you get inspired new food?

00:16:53.350 --> 00:16:55.550
How do you-- and where
do you get inspiration

00:16:55.550 --> 00:16:58.160
to come up with new menu?

00:16:58.160 --> 00:17:00.080
Second question was,
I think you briefly

00:17:00.080 --> 00:17:04.462
mentioned that you went
to the Museum of Chinese--

00:17:04.462 --> 00:17:06.670
CHRIS CHEUNG: Yeah, the
Museum of Chinese in America.

00:17:06.670 --> 00:17:08.544
AUDIENCE: Yeah, Museum
of Chinese in America,

00:17:08.544 --> 00:17:10.280
and then you have a
panel discussion--

00:17:10.280 --> 00:17:12.440
I'm just curious about
what you discussed--

00:17:12.440 --> 00:17:13.940
and you briefly
mentioned that it

00:17:13.940 --> 00:17:18.880
was about dealing with the
perception of the Asian

00:17:18.880 --> 00:17:19.910
Americans?

00:17:19.910 --> 00:17:22.700
And I was just
curious, like, what

00:17:22.700 --> 00:17:26.312
aspect you were trying
to elaborate on?

00:17:26.312 --> 00:17:27.020
CHRIS CHEUNG: OK.

00:17:27.020 --> 00:17:29.750
Well, first question
about inspiration.

00:17:29.750 --> 00:17:32.180
So when your
creative inspiration

00:17:32.180 --> 00:17:33.740
can come from anywhere.

00:17:33.740 --> 00:17:35.660
You go out to eat and
you try different things

00:17:35.660 --> 00:17:36.993
and you can be inspired by that.

00:17:36.993 --> 00:17:38.300
Travel's another way.

00:17:38.300 --> 00:17:40.100
But sometimes, you're
just like laying

00:17:40.100 --> 00:17:42.100
in bed trying to get
to sleep and this idea

00:17:42.100 --> 00:17:43.580
pops in your head.

00:17:43.580 --> 00:17:45.530
Sometimes you're
working on a dish

00:17:45.530 --> 00:17:47.840
and you really trying to
get that last component,

00:17:47.840 --> 00:17:51.470
and you can go for days
trying to figure it out.

00:17:51.470 --> 00:17:54.170
And then one thing
pops and then it

00:17:54.170 --> 00:17:56.090
just kind of just
overflows from there,

00:17:56.090 --> 00:17:58.815
almost like the quarter
machine in Las Vegas

00:17:58.815 --> 00:18:00.940
where you just dropped that
quarter and all of them

00:18:00.940 --> 00:18:02.030
start spilling out.

00:18:02.030 --> 00:18:05.210
So who knows where
it comes from?

00:18:05.210 --> 00:18:08.570
I don't know, but I'm so
glad that it does come.

00:18:08.570 --> 00:18:13.330
And then what we talked
about in the Asian Food

00:18:13.330 --> 00:18:15.080
Mafia in the Museum
of Chinese in America.

00:18:15.080 --> 00:18:18.620
So it was a lot about
sigmas in the beginning.

00:18:18.620 --> 00:18:20.900
About fighting a
lot of the stigmas

00:18:20.900 --> 00:18:24.060
that Asian food used to face.

00:18:24.060 --> 00:18:25.670
MSG was one of them.

00:18:30.250 --> 00:18:32.720
I got to say, there
was a lot of racism

00:18:32.720 --> 00:18:36.230
back in the '60s and '70s
when it came to especially

00:18:36.230 --> 00:18:39.080
Chinese food, and I
think a lot of that

00:18:39.080 --> 00:18:41.390
had to do with Chinese
food all of a sudden

00:18:41.390 --> 00:18:44.840
becoming popular and
taking up pieces of the pie

00:18:44.840 --> 00:18:46.910
from other types of restaurants.

00:18:46.910 --> 00:18:51.380
And there was a backlash
towards it and some propaganda.

00:18:51.380 --> 00:18:55.270
And some of it we
did to ourselves.

00:18:55.270 --> 00:19:00.200
The MSG thing, there was a
lot of Chinese restaurants--

00:19:00.200 --> 00:19:03.920
you'd have mom and pop
and there wasn't really

00:19:03.920 --> 00:19:08.270
enough chefs to go around, so
your uncle would cook the food

00:19:08.270 --> 00:19:11.120
and he wouldn't really know
too much about cooking,

00:19:11.120 --> 00:19:15.920
so he knew that putting this
powder in made it taste better,

00:19:15.920 --> 00:19:17.570
but he would probably misuse it.

00:19:17.570 --> 00:19:23.270
But really, taking that
and making a whole movement

00:19:23.270 --> 00:19:29.540
against an Asian ingredient
which is so widely used in Asia

00:19:29.540 --> 00:19:31.340
would be taking it a
little bit too far,

00:19:31.340 --> 00:19:35.660
so there was a lot of those
things that we had to overcome.

00:19:35.660 --> 00:19:38.750
Presently-- we also talked
about the present stigmas.

00:19:38.750 --> 00:19:45.050
And right now, food in
America is treated with--

00:19:45.050 --> 00:19:46.790
especially with the
higher end chefs--

00:19:46.790 --> 00:19:51.470
with a very big emphasis on
the quality of ingredients.

00:19:51.470 --> 00:19:54.650
And those ingredients
don't come cheap.

00:19:54.650 --> 00:19:58.230
But when an Asian restaurant
uses those same ingredients,

00:19:58.230 --> 00:20:00.800
It's so much harder for them
to demand the same price

00:20:00.800 --> 00:20:05.210
point on their menu because
of the stigma of Asian food

00:20:05.210 --> 00:20:09.890
being so much lower priced
than many other cuisines.

00:20:09.890 --> 00:20:13.070
So the chefs that are trying
their hardest to be creative

00:20:13.070 --> 00:20:15.110
and using those
great ingredients

00:20:15.110 --> 00:20:17.690
can't make any money on it.

00:20:17.690 --> 00:20:19.190
So that was a big thing.

00:20:19.190 --> 00:20:21.200
And then as the future
goes on, how are we

00:20:21.200 --> 00:20:24.050
going to overcome a
lot of these hurdles

00:20:24.050 --> 00:20:28.220
and how we're going
to show a stronger

00:20:28.220 --> 00:20:32.217
voice in the quality of
what we want to cook?

00:20:32.217 --> 00:20:33.050
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:20:33.050 --> 00:20:35.154
And by the way, I really
like that cucumber salad.

00:20:35.154 --> 00:20:36.320
CHRIS CHEUNG: Oh, thank you.

00:20:36.320 --> 00:20:36.903
Appreciate it.

00:20:39.669 --> 00:20:40.210
Hi you doing?

00:20:40.210 --> 00:20:42.850
AUDIENCE: I want back to the
first question because I was--

00:20:42.850 --> 00:20:45.520
and a very practical question.

00:20:45.520 --> 00:20:47.020
You talked about
getting inspiration

00:20:47.020 --> 00:20:49.390
by sampling different
restaurants,

00:20:49.390 --> 00:20:52.314
and I love exploring different
neighborhoods in New York.

00:20:52.314 --> 00:20:53.980
Recently, for example,
I've been hearing

00:20:53.980 --> 00:20:55.780
a lot about College Point.

00:20:55.780 --> 00:20:58.900
Where do you like to go
and what are some places

00:20:58.900 --> 00:21:01.665
that you've stumbled across
that you might recommend?

00:21:01.665 --> 00:21:03.040
CHRIS CHEUNG:
Well, in New York--

00:21:03.040 --> 00:21:06.280
so I've spent a lot of
time in Nashville, so it's

00:21:06.280 --> 00:21:09.040
funny to get inspired by
a whole different food

00:21:09.040 --> 00:21:12.790
scene in a whole
different city and see

00:21:12.790 --> 00:21:14.530
the differences in cooking.

00:21:14.530 --> 00:21:22.690
In New York, you can go to
any of the three Chinatowns

00:21:22.690 --> 00:21:25.600
and get little gems
in the neighborhood.

00:21:25.600 --> 00:21:28.360
So Chinatown in Manhattan
is rapidly changing.

00:21:28.360 --> 00:21:30.790
So it used to be
all Cantonese food,

00:21:30.790 --> 00:21:34.180
and now you're going to get a
big influx of Fuzhounese food,

00:21:34.180 --> 00:21:35.890
which I haven't
even fully explored,

00:21:35.890 --> 00:21:37.810
but it's a totally
different cuisine,

00:21:37.810 --> 00:21:39.490
and so it changes
your perception

00:21:39.490 --> 00:21:42.190
of what Chinese food is.

00:21:42.190 --> 00:21:45.400
So much so, like, I grew
up on Cantonese food,

00:21:45.400 --> 00:21:48.370
that's all I knew as
far as Chinese food.

00:21:48.370 --> 00:21:51.250
I get customers who
come in on a daily basis

00:21:51.250 --> 00:21:55.090
and say, oh, Chinese
food's too spicy.

00:21:55.090 --> 00:21:57.910
And I'm like, I got to think
for a second, I'm like,

00:21:57.910 --> 00:22:00.430
wow, Szechuan food
became that big

00:22:00.430 --> 00:22:02.290
that there are
people who have never

00:22:02.290 --> 00:22:05.170
had any Chinese food
besides Szechuan food,

00:22:05.170 --> 00:22:06.700
and that kind of blows my mind.

00:22:06.700 --> 00:22:08.658
With that being said,
there's some really great

00:22:08.658 --> 00:22:10.035
Szechuan restaurants out there.

00:22:10.035 --> 00:22:13.770
A couple in Queens, in Flushing.

00:22:13.770 --> 00:22:18.500
One called Nan Xiang who does
really great soup dumplings.

00:22:18.500 --> 00:22:21.130
Not Szechuan, but
Dumpling Galaxy

00:22:21.130 --> 00:22:26.560
is another one that has
been big in the press.

00:22:26.560 --> 00:22:28.870
And I've met Helen
at couple events

00:22:28.870 --> 00:22:32.140
and her dumplings are
pretty much spot on.

00:22:32.140 --> 00:22:34.486
You can go into any
of the Chinatowns--

00:22:34.486 --> 00:22:35.860
the Chinatown in
Brooklyn is very

00:22:35.860 --> 00:22:40.070
reminiscent of the Chinatown
in Manhattan 20 years ago,

00:22:40.070 --> 00:22:42.880
and so there's some really
good barbecue joints there.

00:22:42.880 --> 00:22:45.730
And you really kind of
got to go to each one

00:22:45.730 --> 00:22:47.080
and check them out--

00:22:47.080 --> 00:22:49.210
forget Yelp for now.

00:22:49.210 --> 00:22:54.250
Spend some time, hang out,
pick a nice spring day,

00:22:54.250 --> 00:22:57.480
go hungry, and really--

00:22:57.480 --> 00:22:59.260
Chinese food in Chinatown
is pretty cheap,

00:22:59.260 --> 00:23:01.134
there's not really that
big of an investment.

00:23:01.134 --> 00:23:06.540
So you can, for your 30 or 40
bucks, you can eat all day.

00:23:06.540 --> 00:23:08.580
AUDIENCE: So one quick
question followup.

00:23:08.580 --> 00:23:11.070
For the barbecue
restaurant you mentioned,

00:23:11.070 --> 00:23:13.452
I assume it's somewhere
around 8th Avenue,

00:23:13.452 --> 00:23:15.130
do you know the name?

00:23:15.130 --> 00:23:17.380
CHRIS CHEUNG: There was
one barbecue restaurant

00:23:17.380 --> 00:23:20.990
that I've been going to
which is pretty good.

00:23:20.990 --> 00:23:22.900
They have a few locations.

00:23:22.900 --> 00:23:26.009
They also do a type of
cooking for Bok Choy, which

00:23:26.009 --> 00:23:27.550
is basically cooking
in the clay pot.

00:23:27.550 --> 00:23:32.440
It's King's Kitchen, and they
have an outlet in 8th Avenue

00:23:32.440 --> 00:23:35.080
and they have an outlet in
Fort Hamilton Parkway, which

00:23:35.080 --> 00:23:37.610
is a few blocks down
from 8th Avenue.

00:23:37.610 --> 00:23:40.390
And I've been pretty impressed
with what they've been doing,

00:23:40.390 --> 00:23:43.150
so look up King's Kitchen.

00:23:43.150 --> 00:23:45.760
They have barbecue and
clay pot cooking, which

00:23:45.760 --> 00:23:48.310
is really, really cool stuff.

00:23:48.310 --> 00:23:49.157
You'll enjoy it.

00:23:49.157 --> 00:23:49.990
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:23:49.990 --> 00:23:50.830
CHRIS CHEUNG: You're welcome.

00:23:50.830 --> 00:23:53.371
LYZELLE CARREON: You're going
to have to share those with me.

00:23:53.371 --> 00:23:54.637
I hope you write them down.

00:23:54.637 --> 00:23:55.470
AUDIENCE: Hi, Chris.

00:23:55.470 --> 00:23:56.965
Thanks so much for coming.

00:23:56.965 --> 00:23:57.965
CHRIS CHEUNG: Thank you.

00:23:57.965 --> 00:23:59.450
AUDIENCE: I have two questions.

00:23:59.450 --> 00:24:00.970
One, what is some
advice you would

00:24:00.970 --> 00:24:04.550
give to someone who's trying
to start their own business?

00:24:04.550 --> 00:24:06.640
Doesn't have to be a restaurant.

00:24:06.640 --> 00:24:09.040
Any business.

00:24:09.040 --> 00:24:13.390
CHRIS CHEUNG: Well,
OK, so one thing

00:24:13.390 --> 00:24:16.540
is be grounded, be
balanced, because starting

00:24:16.540 --> 00:24:19.040
your own business and an
incredibly difficult thing,

00:24:19.040 --> 00:24:20.950
and like I said,
especially in New York,

00:24:20.950 --> 00:24:22.510
it's even more
difficult, especially

00:24:22.510 --> 00:24:25.740
if you're doing it
from the retail point.

00:24:25.740 --> 00:24:32.590
You know, renting a space in
New York can be very harrowing--

00:24:32.590 --> 00:24:36.160
you need a lawyer,
you need a broker--

00:24:36.160 --> 00:24:40.430
and both those
positions cost money.

00:24:40.430 --> 00:24:42.370
So you're going to spend money.

00:24:42.370 --> 00:24:45.370
From the restaurant side is--

00:24:45.370 --> 00:24:48.190
one big advice I
have is, you need

00:24:48.190 --> 00:24:52.070
to be aware of a
realistic budget.

00:24:52.070 --> 00:24:55.870
So if you think that
it's going to cost you

00:24:55.870 --> 00:25:00.760
$100,000 to open the store,
it's going to cost $200,000.

00:25:00.760 --> 00:25:05.860
Do not open your doors
spending all your money.

00:25:05.860 --> 00:25:11.202
You need to open your doors
with a big cushion, because--

00:25:11.202 --> 00:25:13.660
and I've done this before, so
you think you open your doors

00:25:13.660 --> 00:25:15.700
and you're going to be
busy right off the bat?

00:25:15.700 --> 00:25:17.170
A lot of times that
doesn't happen.

00:25:17.170 --> 00:25:20.500
The food press helps
you and a name helps you

00:25:20.500 --> 00:25:21.930
and you can bring
those people in,

00:25:21.930 --> 00:25:24.020
but sometimes you'll
go three weeks,

00:25:24.020 --> 00:25:28.930
a month before
things start to look

00:25:28.930 --> 00:25:31.640
more realistic to the
numbers that you projected.

00:25:31.640 --> 00:25:33.950
If you can't survive
that month, you're

00:25:33.950 --> 00:25:35.890
already going to be
behind your bills,

00:25:35.890 --> 00:25:40.296
and that's the call of
doom for businesses,

00:25:40.296 --> 00:25:41.670
especially because
nobody's going

00:25:41.670 --> 00:25:43.240
to help you in your first year.

00:25:43.240 --> 00:25:46.390
So then you have to find
another investor, which

00:25:46.390 --> 00:25:49.270
means that your equity is now
less than what you want it to.

00:25:49.270 --> 00:25:51.970
You're not making any money
for the first couple of years.

00:25:51.970 --> 00:25:56.230
And you're working harder than
you've ever done to just get

00:25:56.230 --> 00:25:57.940
your head above water.

00:25:57.940 --> 00:26:03.220
So not to put a dark edge
on opening a business,

00:26:03.220 --> 00:26:06.290
because when you're successful,
there's nothing better,

00:26:06.290 --> 00:26:08.427
but You have to get there.

00:26:08.427 --> 00:26:09.260
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:26:09.260 --> 00:26:09.890
Great tips.

00:26:09.890 --> 00:26:14.100
And Now my next question was,
what made you choose Nashville?

00:26:14.100 --> 00:26:18.000
CHRIS CHEUNG: So I didn't choose
Nashville, Nashville chose me.

00:26:18.000 --> 00:26:21.060
Monique Chauhan, who is
a Food Network celebrity

00:26:21.060 --> 00:26:25.680
chef, I worked with her on
the Sabra Recipe Challenge,

00:26:25.680 --> 00:26:27.540
which was a Food Network--

00:26:27.540 --> 00:26:29.700
Sabra, which makes the
hummus, the company that

00:26:29.700 --> 00:26:34.080
makes the hummus spreads, they
did an internet cooking show

00:26:34.080 --> 00:26:36.420
and we were chosen for
it, so I got to know her

00:26:36.420 --> 00:26:38.010
on the set of that show.

00:26:38.010 --> 00:26:42.840
And afterwards-- and I
used the rib her, too,

00:26:42.840 --> 00:26:45.120
because I was always
a restaurant guy

00:26:45.120 --> 00:26:48.194
and she was pursuing a career
in television at the time

00:26:48.194 --> 00:26:49.860
and I was like, it's
so much cooler just

00:26:49.860 --> 00:26:52.360
to have your own restaurant
and running your restaurant

00:26:52.360 --> 00:26:53.770
and to be on TV.

00:26:53.770 --> 00:26:55.474
You get to cook and
things like that.

00:26:55.474 --> 00:26:57.390
So what she did was she
went down to Nashville

00:26:57.390 --> 00:27:00.350
and she opened up, like, four.

00:27:00.350 --> 00:27:02.040
And one of them
was a Chinese one

00:27:02.040 --> 00:27:04.500
and she needed a
chef to run that,

00:27:04.500 --> 00:27:08.010
and so she made me a partner
and she offered me a deal

00:27:08.010 --> 00:27:12.860
and it was a pretty good deal,
so I said, what the hell.

00:27:12.860 --> 00:27:14.625
So now I have a
restaurant down there.

00:27:14.625 --> 00:27:15.250
AUDIENCE: Cool!

00:27:15.250 --> 00:27:16.650
And what's the name
of the restaurant?

00:27:16.650 --> 00:27:17.670
CHRIS CHEUNG: It's
called Tansuo.

00:27:17.670 --> 00:27:18.211
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:27:18.211 --> 00:27:19.257
And opens later this--

00:27:19.257 --> 00:27:20.840
CHRIS CHEUNG: No,
it's already opened.

00:27:20.840 --> 00:27:23.509
It opened-- it's about
three weeks old now.

00:27:23.509 --> 00:27:24.800
AUDIENCE: Well congratulations.

00:27:24.800 --> 00:27:25.800
CHRIS CHEUNG: Thank you.

00:27:31.054 --> 00:27:33.070
AUDIENCE: Hey, Chris,
thanks for coming.

00:27:33.070 --> 00:27:35.510
I've been to the East
Winds Snack Shop on a date,

00:27:35.510 --> 00:27:36.530
it was really good.

00:27:36.530 --> 00:27:37.626
CHRIS CHEUNG: Thanks, man!

00:27:37.626 --> 00:27:38.750
AUDIENCE: Great experience.

00:27:38.750 --> 00:27:43.130
So you briefly mentioned that
it is pretty hard to open

00:27:43.130 --> 00:27:45.590
a restaurant in New York City.

00:27:45.590 --> 00:27:48.317
Did you ever have like
that oh shit moment like,

00:27:48.317 --> 00:27:49.150
I might not make it.

00:27:49.150 --> 00:27:51.230
Or like a moment of crisis?

00:27:51.230 --> 00:27:52.760
CHRIS CHEUNG: I
have that every day.

00:27:52.760 --> 00:27:54.030
Every single day.

00:27:54.030 --> 00:27:57.470
Every single day you
worry about what the food

00:27:57.470 --> 00:28:00.530
quality, you worry
about your employees,

00:28:00.530 --> 00:28:02.510
you worry about the business--

00:28:02.510 --> 00:28:05.180
you're worrying on
a constant basis.

00:28:05.180 --> 00:28:06.480
It's like having a kid.

00:28:06.480 --> 00:28:11.990
You It's so many moving parts.

00:28:11.990 --> 00:28:14.960
Is the walk in up
the temperature?

00:28:14.960 --> 00:28:17.880
Is my dishwasher coming in late?

00:28:17.880 --> 00:28:20.960
And there's so many things
to handle at every twist

00:28:20.960 --> 00:28:23.420
and turn, you really--

00:28:23.420 --> 00:28:26.210
as the older I got,
I've had to find ways

00:28:26.210 --> 00:28:27.710
to deal with stress better.

00:28:27.710 --> 00:28:29.360
I gotta tell you.

00:28:29.360 --> 00:28:34.370
So you take the good
days when you have them

00:28:34.370 --> 00:28:37.340
and you enjoy them, and
you put your head down you

00:28:37.340 --> 00:28:39.930
knock out every problem
as they come along.

00:28:39.930 --> 00:28:43.310
It's managing crises when
you own your own business,

00:28:43.310 --> 00:28:46.425
especially a restaurant.

00:28:46.425 --> 00:28:48.550
AUDIENCE: Surely at some
point the number of crises

00:28:48.550 --> 00:28:50.130
starts to normalize.

00:28:50.130 --> 00:28:52.610
CHRIS CHEUNG: No, what it
becomes is becomes normal.

00:28:52.610 --> 00:28:56.840
And you just kind of take it
without really much emotion,

00:28:56.840 --> 00:29:01.040
and, you know, call the
repair guy, pay the money,

00:29:01.040 --> 00:29:07.100
hire the new cook, fire the
old one for not showing up,

00:29:07.100 --> 00:29:08.520
things like that.

00:29:08.520 --> 00:29:12.080
And you have to
wear a lot of hats

00:29:12.080 --> 00:29:17.330
and you have to be able to be
calm under pressure and figure

00:29:17.330 --> 00:29:22.280
things out as you go and try to
figure things out in the least

00:29:22.280 --> 00:29:23.285
expensive way possible.

00:29:28.534 --> 00:29:29.200
Hey, [INAUDIBLE]

00:29:29.200 --> 00:29:31.470
AUDIENCE: Hey, Chris.

00:29:31.470 --> 00:29:33.250
So I have two questions.

00:29:33.250 --> 00:29:36.090
The first one is,
what do you think

00:29:36.090 --> 00:29:39.510
about the integrated
tipping system that's

00:29:39.510 --> 00:29:41.610
coming through a
lot of restaurant--

00:29:41.610 --> 00:29:45.214
maybe not a lot-- some
restaurants in New York?

00:29:45.214 --> 00:29:46.110
I'll start with that.

00:29:46.110 --> 00:29:51.030
CHRIS CHEUNG: All right,
so yeah, I don't get it.

00:29:51.030 --> 00:29:53.130
I'm the back of the house guy.

00:29:53.130 --> 00:29:55.230
I'm a chef, but I
was always a chef,

00:29:55.230 --> 00:29:56.550
I was a cook for many years.

00:29:56.550 --> 00:30:00.800
And yeah, it really
does suck to--

00:30:00.800 --> 00:30:02.120
let's say, take Jean-George.

00:30:02.120 --> 00:30:04.620
For Jean-George, I
worked with Jean-George

00:30:04.620 --> 00:30:09.090
and I worked about
100 hours a week.

00:30:09.090 --> 00:30:11.940
The shift was come in at
9:00 and leave at 6:00.

00:30:11.940 --> 00:30:15.540
I'd come in at 6:30 and leave
at 9:30 or 10:00 at night just

00:30:15.540 --> 00:30:17.160
to get my stuff done.

00:30:17.160 --> 00:30:21.460
And I got paid about
$250 a week for that job.

00:30:21.460 --> 00:30:23.370
And it really sucked
to watch waiters

00:30:23.370 --> 00:30:27.750
leave making $500 a night.

00:30:27.750 --> 00:30:35.160
But I see a lot of talk about
we have to take the tipping away

00:30:35.160 --> 00:30:37.230
and pay the back of the
house-- which is great,

00:30:37.230 --> 00:30:40.080
because I'm a back
of the house guy--

00:30:40.080 --> 00:30:45.780
and then raise your prices
on the menu to justify that.

00:30:45.780 --> 00:30:48.521
I don't see why you have
to take tipping away.

00:30:48.521 --> 00:30:50.520
If you're going to raise
the prices on the menu,

00:30:50.520 --> 00:30:52.603
make it simple, just raise
the prices on the menu.

00:30:52.603 --> 00:30:56.400
Somebody has got to pay for
the higher increase of labor.

00:30:56.400 --> 00:31:02.310
There's a big push to
make the minimum wage $15,

00:31:02.310 --> 00:31:04.500
and that's for your
lowest paid employees,

00:31:04.500 --> 00:31:07.830
so that's basically for the guy
who cleans the restaurant, $15.

00:31:07.830 --> 00:31:11.970
Cooks will probably
make $18 an hour.

00:31:11.970 --> 00:31:15.510
Which is great, everybody
should get a fair wage,

00:31:15.510 --> 00:31:17.557
but you where that money's
coming from, right?

00:31:17.557 --> 00:31:19.140
That doesn't come
out of the business.

00:31:19.140 --> 00:31:21.540
The profit margins
for restaurants are,

00:31:21.540 --> 00:31:23.760
if you don't know,
are tremendously low.

00:31:23.760 --> 00:31:28.350
If you're making 20%,
you're doing really good.

00:31:28.350 --> 00:31:30.540
Sometimes you're just
doing it on to break even.

00:31:30.540 --> 00:31:32.640
So for restaurants that
are struggling and have

00:31:32.640 --> 00:31:35.500
to pay that, the menu prices
are going to go up eventually.

00:31:35.500 --> 00:31:38.040
The restaurant world
is resisting that now.

00:31:38.040 --> 00:31:39.690
Because everybody's afraid.

00:31:39.690 --> 00:31:41.580
It's a tough market.

00:31:41.580 --> 00:31:44.400
But eventually,
you're not even going

00:31:44.400 --> 00:31:47.430
to blink at a $25 hamburger.

00:31:47.430 --> 00:31:50.099
That's just how
it's going to be.

00:31:50.099 --> 00:31:50.765
AUDIENCE: Right.

00:31:50.765 --> 00:31:51.556
I need a promotion.

00:31:51.556 --> 00:31:56.520
[LAUGHS] The next question
is, you've worked out of a lot

00:31:56.520 --> 00:31:58.230
of really incredible
restaurants--

00:31:58.230 --> 00:32:02.220
Jean-George's, a few
others-- so I'm curious,

00:32:02.220 --> 00:32:06.120
who was one chef that you worked
with that you really respected

00:32:06.120 --> 00:32:09.780
or maybe just something that
they did that you found just--

00:32:09.780 --> 00:32:11.040
like maybe you do it--

00:32:11.040 --> 00:32:13.350
you find kind of integrating
into your day to day?

00:32:13.350 --> 00:32:14.730
CHRIS CHEUNG: Yeah.

00:32:14.730 --> 00:32:17.760
There's been a lot of chefs
that helped me in my career

00:32:17.760 --> 00:32:18.810
in different aspects.

00:32:18.810 --> 00:32:22.440
So I worked for Jean-George
and I worked for Nobu,

00:32:22.440 --> 00:32:25.680
and Jean-George was great
because the name was great,

00:32:25.680 --> 00:32:27.750
and I, in his
kitchen especially,

00:32:27.750 --> 00:32:32.070
at Jean-George's,
learning the discipline

00:32:32.070 --> 00:32:34.050
of cooking four-star
French cuisine,

00:32:34.050 --> 00:32:37.350
you really got to immerse
yourself in that world.

00:32:37.350 --> 00:32:40.396
When you work at a four
star restaurant, four star

00:32:40.396 --> 00:32:42.520
"New York Times" restaurant,
which probably equates

00:32:42.520 --> 00:32:47.580
to three star Michelin or two
star Michelin here in America,

00:32:47.580 --> 00:32:51.420
it's very much like working
in the very strict confines

00:32:51.420 --> 00:32:53.160
of a French restaurant.

00:32:53.160 --> 00:32:56.114
You gotta give yourself
to that discipline.

00:32:56.114 --> 00:32:58.530
You're not going to see family,
you're not going to go out

00:32:58.530 --> 00:33:00.488
and party, you're not
going to see your friends

00:33:00.488 --> 00:33:04.320
on the weekend, you basically
work that 100, 110 hours a week

00:33:04.320 --> 00:33:06.330
and just concentrate on cooking.

00:33:06.330 --> 00:33:07.730
And that's what that gave me.

00:33:07.730 --> 00:33:12.600
So basically, I learned
to be really attached

00:33:12.600 --> 00:33:15.270
to the craft of what cooking is.

00:33:15.270 --> 00:33:18.240
Nobu, on the other hand, I
was a young cook at Nobu,

00:33:18.240 --> 00:33:21.120
and he let me
experiment with dishes

00:33:21.120 --> 00:33:24.450
that a young cook would have
no place experimenting with

00:33:24.450 --> 00:33:25.920
and get stuff on the menu.

00:33:25.920 --> 00:33:30.720
And so he was integral for
sparking a creative edge in me

00:33:30.720 --> 00:33:31.830
as well.

00:33:31.830 --> 00:33:37.050
I worked for James Chu, who was
the chef at Typhoon Brewery.

00:33:37.050 --> 00:33:39.150
He's not as well
known as those, chefs

00:33:39.150 --> 00:33:42.720
but he really taught me how to
break down flavors on my palate

00:33:42.720 --> 00:33:43.650
as we ate.

00:33:43.650 --> 00:33:46.120
His whole thing was the
five flavors of food,

00:33:46.120 --> 00:33:49.470
which was spicy, sour,
sweet, salty, bitter,

00:33:49.470 --> 00:33:53.640
and how to discern
that as you eat.

00:33:53.640 --> 00:33:56.880
And so that was very integral.

00:33:56.880 --> 00:34:00.480
So each chef that
you learn under,

00:34:00.480 --> 00:34:01.980
you'll learn under
different things.

00:34:01.980 --> 00:34:06.180
As I got higher up the ladder, I
learned under a Dim Sum master.

00:34:06.180 --> 00:34:09.428
And he just taught me
techniques of Chinese food

00:34:09.428 --> 00:34:11.219
and recipes of Chinese
food that I wouldn't

00:34:11.219 --> 00:34:12.480
have learned anywhere else.

00:34:12.480 --> 00:34:16.290
And that was really an important
part of my learning process

00:34:16.290 --> 00:34:17.257
as well.

00:34:17.257 --> 00:34:18.090
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:34:18.090 --> 00:34:19.298
CHRIS CHEUNG: You're welcome.

00:34:27.600 --> 00:34:28.339
How are you?

00:34:28.339 --> 00:34:29.219
AUDIENCE: Hey, Chris.

00:34:29.219 --> 00:34:30.475
Thanks for coming.

00:34:30.475 --> 00:34:32.370
So I was wondering
what's the best

00:34:32.370 --> 00:34:34.280
way to market your business?

00:34:34.280 --> 00:34:35.202
Do you use AdWords?

00:34:38.429 --> 00:34:41.429
CHRIS CHEUNG: Let's see,
how do I answer that one?

00:34:41.429 --> 00:34:46.320
No, but send me an email
and I'll check it out.

00:34:50.250 --> 00:34:53.489
The world is expanded
and contracted

00:34:53.489 --> 00:34:58.470
as far as marketing a business
and special restaurants, right?

00:34:58.470 --> 00:35:01.080
Like I said, the city makes it
difficult. You know, the best--

00:35:01.080 --> 00:35:04.830
the easiest way for restaurants
that-- a neighborhood

00:35:04.830 --> 00:35:06.480
restaurant-- to
market themselves,

00:35:06.480 --> 00:35:09.630
was to pass flyers
throughout all the houses

00:35:09.630 --> 00:35:13.980
that are near you on
your block, right?

00:35:13.980 --> 00:35:15.030
They took that away.

00:35:15.030 --> 00:35:17.550
They fine you now if
you do that, right?

00:35:17.550 --> 00:35:22.260
So it's kind of illegal or
we're not permitted anymore,

00:35:22.260 --> 00:35:23.520
which is really tough, right?

00:35:23.520 --> 00:35:26.880
Because you still see
the market [INAUDIBLE].

00:35:26.880 --> 00:35:29.430
The big companies can do
it because they either

00:35:29.430 --> 00:35:31.230
get the allowance
to do it or they can

00:35:31.230 --> 00:35:33.420
afford to pay the fines, right?

00:35:33.420 --> 00:35:37.170
So with that taken away,
it's really, really tough

00:35:37.170 --> 00:35:39.840
for a restaurant to
get their name out.

00:35:39.840 --> 00:35:41.460
But you have social media now.

00:35:41.460 --> 00:35:45.900
And social media is a big
part of getting the word out

00:35:45.900 --> 00:35:47.760
and getting people to
see what you are all

00:35:47.760 --> 00:35:54.060
about with the pictures
and just saying things

00:35:54.060 --> 00:35:57.500
that you want people to
know about your place.

00:35:57.500 --> 00:35:59.470
So that helps a lot.

00:35:59.470 --> 00:36:04.260
The press, food press,
for operators like me

00:36:04.260 --> 00:36:06.720
are extremely important.

00:36:06.720 --> 00:36:10.620
As a chef, you live and die
by what a reviewer says.

00:36:10.620 --> 00:36:15.270
And you got to take the good
with the bad, knock on wood.

00:36:15.270 --> 00:36:20.880
I've had my share
of good, so that's

00:36:20.880 --> 00:36:22.350
one of the special
things that make

00:36:22.350 --> 00:36:26.531
New York a really cool food city
to get that, but not everybody

00:36:26.531 --> 00:36:27.030
gets that.

00:36:27.030 --> 00:36:33.330
So the climb is tough and
really, sometimes quality

00:36:33.330 --> 00:36:35.960
and just doing the right
thing isn't enough.

00:36:35.960 --> 00:36:37.950
You really got to
have other resources.

00:36:41.280 --> 00:36:46.290
Anything that will help
you in an inexpensive way,

00:36:46.290 --> 00:36:48.647
you have to explore.

00:36:48.647 --> 00:36:49.480
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:36:49.480 --> 00:36:50.355
CHRIS CHEUNG: Thanks.

00:36:54.200 --> 00:36:56.290
Everybody good?

00:36:56.290 --> 00:36:59.820
LYZELLE CARREON: Do we
have any other questions?

00:36:59.820 --> 00:37:00.730
I guess that's it--

00:37:00.730 --> 00:37:01.390
oh, one more.

00:37:03.650 --> 00:37:05.400
AUDIENCE: First of
all, I'm from Lawrence.

00:37:05.400 --> 00:37:08.140
My teammate, we both were for
AdWords and ask the question.

00:37:08.140 --> 00:37:12.600
[LAUGHTER] The first one
is more of the comment

00:37:12.600 --> 00:37:14.820
about what you said
about the Asian, kind

00:37:14.820 --> 00:37:17.830
of umbrella of term, the Asian.

00:37:17.830 --> 00:37:20.960
There was actually a great
panel a couple weeks--

00:37:20.960 --> 00:37:23.415
I don't know if other
people watched--

00:37:23.415 --> 00:37:30.426
on kind of diversity, and
there were a Sikh activist

00:37:30.426 --> 00:37:34.710
and a Korean blogger and I
think a [INAUDIBLE] activist?

00:37:34.710 --> 00:37:36.780
Quite a few diverse--

00:37:36.780 --> 00:37:38.990
the bulk of all Asian
representatives,

00:37:38.990 --> 00:37:41.280
and the Korean
blogger was great.

00:37:41.280 --> 00:37:43.110
And he was saying--

00:37:43.110 --> 00:37:45.070
he was kind of the
same thing, right?

00:37:45.070 --> 00:37:49.890
Because Asian is so
not all Asian talk--

00:37:49.890 --> 00:37:53.860
oh, Asian community, but it's
really so diverse within Asia.

00:37:53.860 --> 00:37:55.660
But the funny thing
that he said is

00:37:55.660 --> 00:37:57.810
that, one thing that
kind of seem to unite,

00:37:57.810 --> 00:37:58.970
where even like--

00:37:58.970 --> 00:38:00.570
distinguish Asian is food!

00:38:00.570 --> 00:38:02.920
We eat so diverse,
different food.

00:38:02.920 --> 00:38:05.311
But that may be one thing
that unites us, right?

00:38:05.311 --> 00:38:06.060
CHRIS CHEUNG: Yes.

00:38:06.060 --> 00:38:07.710
AUDIENCE: Or something.

00:38:07.710 --> 00:38:11.809
So I think you as a great
Chinese chef, or Asian chef--

00:38:11.809 --> 00:38:13.350
I don't really think
that [INAUDIBLE]

00:38:13.350 --> 00:38:15.380
brand yourself as Asian.

00:38:15.380 --> 00:38:19.150
CHRIS CHEUNG: I cooked
a lot of Thai food,

00:38:19.150 --> 00:38:22.270
I cooked a lot of Japanese food,
but the last few years I've

00:38:22.270 --> 00:38:24.000
really immersed myself
into Chinese food,

00:38:24.000 --> 00:38:26.650
so I kind of refer to
myself as a Chinese chef.

00:38:26.650 --> 00:38:31.360
But I am familiar, very
familiar with other types

00:38:31.360 --> 00:38:33.160
of Asian cooking.

00:38:33.160 --> 00:38:37.330
And again, it's a word
that, for a lot of years,

00:38:37.330 --> 00:38:40.300
it kind of bothered
me a little bit.

00:38:40.300 --> 00:38:43.300
We don't refer to European
cooking as European cooking,

00:38:43.300 --> 00:38:45.580
it's French or Italian.

00:38:45.580 --> 00:38:49.150
And so I struggled with that.

00:38:49.150 --> 00:38:52.930
I haven't-- and I still use the
term because it's widely used

00:38:52.930 --> 00:38:56.830
in general, and it does have
some good to it as well.

00:38:56.830 --> 00:38:58.500
But I do struggle with that.

00:38:58.500 --> 00:39:04.330
As part of an identity, you
want, as a Chinese person,

00:39:04.330 --> 00:39:05.895
you don't want to
really be referred

00:39:05.895 --> 00:39:08.020
to as Asian, you want to
be referred to as Chinese,

00:39:08.020 --> 00:39:10.600
and I'm sure if you're
Korean or you Japanese

00:39:10.600 --> 00:39:12.790
or you're Indian or--

00:39:12.790 --> 00:39:15.490
you want the same thing.

00:39:15.490 --> 00:39:21.400
But on the other hand, the
perception of it as a tool

00:39:21.400 --> 00:39:23.120
can be very beneficial.

00:39:23.120 --> 00:39:26.290
So yeah, it's a struggle,
at least for me,

00:39:26.290 --> 00:39:28.580
to kind of come to
terms with that.

00:39:28.580 --> 00:39:31.040
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] And by
the way, how are you branding

00:39:31.040 --> 00:39:33.029
your new Nashville restaurant?

00:39:33.029 --> 00:39:33.820
CHRIS CHEUNG: Yeah.

00:39:33.820 --> 00:39:37.270
So again, I brand it as a--

00:39:37.270 --> 00:39:40.100
when I'm approached, I say
it's a Chinese restaurant.

00:39:40.100 --> 00:39:44.350
Nashville actually
happens to be publicly--

00:39:46.860 --> 00:39:49.710
they publicly say they
need better Chinese food

00:39:49.710 --> 00:39:53.230
in the city, from everywhere
from the mayor to the cab

00:39:53.230 --> 00:39:57.160
drivers to everybody,
it's amazing.

00:39:57.160 --> 00:40:02.830
But their perception
is also rooted

00:40:02.830 --> 00:40:07.769
in having Asian
eateries in town.

00:40:07.769 --> 00:40:09.310
But it's a little
bit different there

00:40:09.310 --> 00:40:13.360
because they don't have a big
Asian community, so they're

00:40:13.360 --> 00:40:17.951
accepting of pretty much
any good quality Asian food

00:40:17.951 --> 00:40:18.700
that they can get.

00:40:22.720 --> 00:40:25.150
Hopefully I've given them
something that they want.

00:40:25.150 --> 00:40:27.097
So far, so good.

00:40:27.097 --> 00:40:28.680
AUDIENCE: All right,
another question.

00:40:28.680 --> 00:40:31.990
Oh, actually, sorry, forgot
to thank you for coming.

00:40:31.990 --> 00:40:34.353
And so this question is--

00:40:34.353 --> 00:40:36.820
maybe more like
a trick question.

00:40:36.820 --> 00:40:42.040
So you mention that your East
Wind is only three block away,

00:40:42.040 --> 00:40:42.540
right?

00:40:42.540 --> 00:40:46.420
So it's probably easy
for you to commute.

00:40:46.420 --> 00:40:49.090
Are there days when you just
feel like, oh, I'm going there

00:40:49.090 --> 00:40:51.340
again, I'm making
the same dumpling,

00:40:51.340 --> 00:40:55.120
say you whatever, that maybe
I should do something else.

00:40:55.120 --> 00:40:57.510
I mean, you actually
opened your new restaurant.

00:40:57.510 --> 00:40:59.440
And that kind
relates to us, right?

00:40:59.440 --> 00:41:02.462
We're engineers and
our thing or whatever.

00:41:02.462 --> 00:41:04.860
And we have to get out and
commute to our-- today, it's

00:41:04.860 --> 00:41:05.475
great right?

00:41:05.475 --> 00:41:08.160
Because we get to eat
your bao and salad,

00:41:08.160 --> 00:41:09.550
that really get me up--

00:41:09.550 --> 00:41:12.280
but how do you get
by the daily grind?

00:41:12.280 --> 00:41:16.240
CHRIS CHEUNG: Well,
it's each to his own.

00:41:16.240 --> 00:41:19.360
The daily grind, everybody
has their daily grind, right?

00:41:19.360 --> 00:41:23.350
Some days are
better than others.

00:41:23.350 --> 00:41:25.960
Good cooking is
rooted in repetition,

00:41:25.960 --> 00:41:29.620
so some days you will
take the practice

00:41:29.620 --> 00:41:32.740
and some days you look
forward to holding a craft

00:41:32.740 --> 00:41:35.350
and trying to do better
than the day before.

00:41:35.350 --> 00:41:38.260
Sometimes that you've had
a bad day the day before,

00:41:38.260 --> 00:41:40.300
but in the restaurant
business, a bad day

00:41:40.300 --> 00:41:45.260
means you get to do it again the
next day and try even harder.

00:41:45.260 --> 00:41:50.200
So you have that as a
motivational tool for you.

00:41:50.200 --> 00:41:55.810
But there are some days, whole
10 degree day in February,

00:41:55.810 --> 00:41:57.940
you've got to get out
there early to shovel snow

00:41:57.940 --> 00:41:59.740
before you actually
start cooking.

00:41:59.740 --> 00:42:04.690
Or 98 degrees in August where
basically the last thing

00:42:04.690 --> 00:42:06.970
you want to do is leave your
air conditioned bedroom.

00:42:09.580 --> 00:42:12.820
But there were a lot
of benefits to being

00:42:12.820 --> 00:42:15.070
successful in the
restaurant business.

00:42:15.070 --> 00:42:18.250
You get to do other projects,
you get to do events,

00:42:18.250 --> 00:42:22.090
you get to come to Google and
hang out and talk and talk

00:42:22.090 --> 00:42:23.210
shop and things like that.

00:42:23.210 --> 00:42:26.200
So mixing it up is
always good and getting

00:42:26.200 --> 00:42:29.250
a little bit of recognition for
some hard work is always good.

00:42:29.250 --> 00:42:32.980
But knowing that you always have
to go back and cook the food--

00:42:32.980 --> 00:42:36.070
you got to make the doughnuts--

00:42:36.070 --> 00:42:37.480
is very important.

00:42:37.480 --> 00:42:40.300
You can't lose
sight of what you've

00:42:40.300 --> 00:42:43.590
done the years before
for your whole career,

00:42:43.590 --> 00:42:47.290
and that basically was going
into work the very next day.

00:42:47.290 --> 00:42:50.620
My business is a
six day work week.

00:42:50.620 --> 00:42:53.140
Now, for me, it's a
seven day work week.

00:42:53.140 --> 00:42:56.380
It's 12 hours a day minimum.

00:42:56.380 --> 00:42:59.770
It's working on Christmas,
it's working on Thanksgiving,

00:42:59.770 --> 00:43:03.500
so it's missing all the weddings
and all the birthday parties.

00:43:03.500 --> 00:43:09.390
So you have to really be
dedicated to your craft to--

00:43:09.390 --> 00:43:10.460
I haven't missed that.

00:43:10.460 --> 00:43:12.130
I come home to a quiet house.

00:43:12.130 --> 00:43:13.840
My kids and wife
are already sleeping

00:43:13.840 --> 00:43:15.070
by the time I get home.

00:43:15.070 --> 00:43:17.177
So it's kind of one
of those things.

00:43:17.177 --> 00:43:18.010
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:43:18.010 --> 00:43:19.560
I guess I should
stay in Google, then.

00:43:19.560 --> 00:43:20.143
It's too hard.

00:43:22.882 --> 00:43:23.465
AUDIENCE: Hey.

00:43:23.465 --> 00:43:24.130
CHRIS CHEUNG: Hey, how are you?

00:43:24.130 --> 00:43:25.040
AUDIENCE: Thanks
again for coming in.

00:43:25.040 --> 00:43:25.780
CHRIS CHEUNG: Thanks.

00:43:25.780 --> 00:43:28.113
AUDIENCE: So we have Anthony
Bourdain opening his market

00:43:28.113 --> 00:43:31.920
two blocks from us here,
which is an interesting trend,

00:43:31.920 --> 00:43:33.910
and that's the basis
of my question.

00:43:33.910 --> 00:43:37.310
Do you think these markets
mean the future trend

00:43:37.310 --> 00:43:38.890
within the industry,
specifically

00:43:38.890 --> 00:43:40.990
for Asian restaurants?

00:43:40.990 --> 00:43:44.277
Or, if you step forward
five, 10 years from now,

00:43:44.277 --> 00:43:46.360
what is the restaurant
scene, the Asian restaurant

00:43:46.360 --> 00:43:48.354
scene in this area?

00:43:48.354 --> 00:43:49.270
CHRIS CHEUNG: It's a--

00:43:49.270 --> 00:43:51.370
that's a pretty loaded
question, because I

00:43:51.370 --> 00:43:57.820
think that on the base of it,
the food court and food stalls

00:43:57.820 --> 00:44:02.407
are inspired from a lot of
what we see outside of America.

00:44:02.407 --> 00:44:04.990
They're very popular in Europe,
they're very also very popular

00:44:04.990 --> 00:44:07.930
in all around Asia-- the
night markets in Asia--

00:44:07.930 --> 00:44:09.640
and they kind of
follow on those things

00:44:09.640 --> 00:44:11.560
and they're immensely
popular there.

00:44:11.560 --> 00:44:15.130
If we can get the
operation to represent

00:44:15.130 --> 00:44:20.090
what the American crowd
would accept here as well

00:44:20.090 --> 00:44:21.910
and it's done right--

00:44:21.910 --> 00:44:26.740
those places can be very
disorganized and very crazy,

00:44:26.740 --> 00:44:30.850
and some of the regulations,
especially in this city,

00:44:30.850 --> 00:44:34.150
probably won't allow that
much chaos to happen,

00:44:34.150 --> 00:44:36.310
so there has to be a little
bit of a middle ground.

00:44:39.036 --> 00:44:41.244
You kind of got to take that
[INAUDIBLE] of the woods

00:44:41.244 --> 00:44:42.070
so that there's--

00:44:42.070 --> 00:44:45.190
As real estate in New York
becomes way more and more

00:44:45.190 --> 00:44:50.410
expensive and smaller guys with
a lot of creative bones in them

00:44:50.410 --> 00:44:53.560
can't open restaurants,
especially in Manhattan--

00:44:53.560 --> 00:44:56.650
they have to go to Queens,
they have to go to Brooklyn--

00:44:56.650 --> 00:44:59.230
and if there is
opportunities for them

00:44:59.230 --> 00:45:02.830
to do it with less
money, those food stalls

00:45:02.830 --> 00:45:05.450
are going to become very
important for guys like that,

00:45:05.450 --> 00:45:07.150
especially me.

00:45:07.150 --> 00:45:12.460
And the opportunities become a
little bit more easier to have.

00:45:12.460 --> 00:45:18.800
And it's going to promote a lot
of chefs to do better things.

00:45:18.800 --> 00:45:22.690
And then though, on
the other side of it,

00:45:22.690 --> 00:45:28.870
it still will perpetuate the
perception of Asian food being

00:45:28.870 --> 00:45:32.440
cheap, because I don't think
many people are going to want--

00:45:32.440 --> 00:45:34.360
food stores aren't
usually cheap,

00:45:34.360 --> 00:45:36.050
but they're not
super expense and you

00:45:36.050 --> 00:45:38.750
can't get fine dining
out of them either,

00:45:38.750 --> 00:45:42.320
and that's one of the areas
that a lot of Asian chefs

00:45:42.320 --> 00:45:46.880
and restaurants, especially
in New York and in America,

00:45:46.880 --> 00:45:49.460
haven't been able to be
successful in the fine dining

00:45:49.460 --> 00:45:50.450
level.

00:45:50.450 --> 00:45:54.020
That's not going to
help that part too much.

00:45:54.020 --> 00:45:57.440
So it just depends on kind
of where you're looking at.

00:45:57.440 --> 00:46:02.840
And I think most of the
smaller mom and pop businesses

00:46:02.840 --> 00:46:06.860
are willing to sacrifice
that in an effort to be

00:46:06.860 --> 00:46:08.572
successful in the business end.

00:46:08.572 --> 00:46:10.030
AUDIENCE: Yeah it
seems if you just

00:46:10.030 --> 00:46:12.880
remove a lot of
the administration,

00:46:12.880 --> 00:46:14.987
it's like working for one
the startup [INAUDIBLE]

00:46:14.987 --> 00:46:15.820
or something, right?

00:46:15.820 --> 00:46:18.270
Where location is taken
care of, a lot overhead

00:46:18.270 --> 00:46:21.230
is taken care of, you can
focus more on the craft.

00:46:21.230 --> 00:46:23.780
CHRIS CHEUNG:
Yeah, but everybody

00:46:23.780 --> 00:46:25.280
takes their piece
of the pie, right?

00:46:25.280 --> 00:46:29.090
So I've been in
a couple of deals

00:46:29.090 --> 00:46:36.710
with a couple of food stalls
and a lot the space is shared.

00:46:36.710 --> 00:46:38.000
The refrigerator.

00:46:38.000 --> 00:46:39.690
Refrigeration is shared.

00:46:39.690 --> 00:46:41.600
The work spaces are shared.

00:46:41.600 --> 00:46:46.770
And what I'm going
to find interesting,

00:46:46.770 --> 00:46:49.250
especially on the
Bourdain food stall,

00:46:49.250 --> 00:46:53.930
is he doesn't just
have people sharing,

00:46:53.930 --> 00:46:56.120
he has people from
different countries

00:46:56.120 --> 00:46:58.100
that don't speak
the same language--

00:46:58.100 --> 00:47:00.020
that aren't from here--

00:47:00.020 --> 00:47:02.420
all sharing the
same common areas.

00:47:02.420 --> 00:47:08.480
And I have a kitchen, and when
my saute cook and my wok cook

00:47:08.480 --> 00:47:12.740
can't fit the ingredients
in the same area in the wok

00:47:12.740 --> 00:47:16.940
and it comes close to blows.

00:47:16.940 --> 00:47:18.860
And so when they're
all going to have

00:47:18.860 --> 00:47:22.810
to learn how to share and
then be up to standards

00:47:22.810 --> 00:47:29.000
and sanitary things and
reporting and all that stuff,

00:47:29.000 --> 00:47:33.920
he has a big hurdle to overcome
on something like that,

00:47:33.920 --> 00:47:34.633
I believe.

00:47:34.633 --> 00:47:35.320
AUDIENCE: That's a
great perspective.

00:47:35.320 --> 00:47:35.730
Thank you.

00:47:35.730 --> 00:47:36.855
CHRIS CHEUNG: Yeah, thanks.

00:47:40.020 --> 00:47:42.590
AUDIENCE: Same topic, but I
know DaDong has just opened,

00:47:42.590 --> 00:47:45.944
the Peking duck place,
upscale, in Bryant Park?

00:47:45.944 --> 00:47:47.110
CHRIS CHEUNG: Yes, yes, yes.

00:47:47.110 --> 00:47:49.340
AUDIENCE: Do you
think that will impact

00:47:49.340 --> 00:47:51.050
the perception of Asian food?

00:47:51.050 --> 00:47:53.120
I can't imagine that's
going to be inexpensive.

00:47:53.120 --> 00:47:55.700
CHRIS CHEUNG: No, I don't
think it's going to be--

00:47:55.700 --> 00:47:56.810
I know the guy.

00:47:59.197 --> 00:48:01.280
I've heard of the guy and
I know some of the deals

00:48:01.280 --> 00:48:02.196
that he's been trying.

00:48:02.196 --> 00:48:04.790
He wanted that real
estate for free.

00:48:04.790 --> 00:48:08.210
He wanted that rent free
because it's his name.

00:48:08.210 --> 00:48:09.770
I'm not sure if
he got that deal,

00:48:09.770 --> 00:48:12.290
but he's got a pretty good
sweetheart deal for the Bryant

00:48:12.290 --> 00:48:14.250
Park location.

00:48:17.980 --> 00:48:19.970
It may.

00:48:19.970 --> 00:48:22.910
I think it will, but
it will be tempered.

00:48:22.910 --> 00:48:25.730
I don't think it's
going to carry the torch

00:48:25.730 --> 00:48:30.200
to make Chinese restaurants
one or two Michelin

00:48:30.200 --> 00:48:35.720
star for the rest of the
chefs that want to come here.

00:48:35.720 --> 00:48:38.210
New York is a funny place.

00:48:38.210 --> 00:48:40.640
When people from
outside New York

00:48:40.640 --> 00:48:43.880
think off the bat that they're
going to have an automatic hit,

00:48:43.880 --> 00:48:45.830
sometimes it doesn't
work out for them.

00:48:45.830 --> 00:48:47.300
I wish him all the best.

00:48:47.300 --> 00:48:50.030
He has a really,
really good reputation.

00:48:50.030 --> 00:48:52.670
If he can replicate
what he does in Hong

00:48:52.670 --> 00:48:55.380
Kong and the other
places in the world--

00:48:55.380 --> 00:48:57.300
I think he has
Australia, and I think

00:48:57.300 --> 00:48:59.390
he has another place too--

00:48:59.390 --> 00:49:02.824
if he can do that in
New York successfully--

00:49:02.824 --> 00:49:04.740
and again, he's going
to fight the same stigma

00:49:04.740 --> 00:49:05.720
as everybody else is.

00:49:05.720 --> 00:49:10.144
I don't see, because of
his name and reputation,

00:49:10.144 --> 00:49:12.560
I think he still gonna have
to fight through some of that.

00:49:12.560 --> 00:49:14.580
So it's a wait and
see kind of thing.

00:49:14.580 --> 00:49:16.580
I think it's going
to have to be organic

00:49:16.580 --> 00:49:20.280
and it's going to take time.

00:49:20.280 --> 00:49:22.700
But the wheels are
turning already.

00:49:22.700 --> 00:49:27.350
We are a lot farther from
the starting point where

00:49:27.350 --> 00:49:31.340
we were 20 years ago, so
hopefully in five years

00:49:31.340 --> 00:49:33.404
we can make another
big leap as well.

00:49:36.792 --> 00:49:38.250
LYZELLE CARREON:
I think that's all

00:49:38.250 --> 00:49:40.180
the time we have for questions.

00:49:40.180 --> 00:49:42.300
Thank you so much,
Chris for being here

00:49:42.300 --> 00:49:44.100
and for answering
all our questions!

00:49:44.100 --> 00:49:47.070
CHRIS CHEUNG: I had a
blast, that was really cool!

00:49:47.070 --> 00:49:50.420
[APPLAUSE]
