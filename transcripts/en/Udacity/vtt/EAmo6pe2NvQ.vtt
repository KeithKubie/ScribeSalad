00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:04.890
Now that we have a derived feature x, before we go on to making

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:11.020
kernel density estimates let's look at a simple histogram, of this feature x.

00:00:11.020 --> 00:00:15.553
Let's switch to our [INAUDIBLE] in this block off code here,

00:00:15.553 --> 00:00:19.750
in the [INAUDIBLE] we have defined the variable x.

00:00:19.750 --> 00:00:24.860
We're going to bend it between 0 and 1 with 100 bins.

00:00:24.860 --> 00:00:29.450
We're not going to normalize it, so we can look at the number of entries.

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:31.630
Let's run this piece of code.

00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:33.880
Once the code has finished running,

00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:36.640
you will see a histogram that looks like this.

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:39.587
This is our variable of interest x.

00:00:42.227 --> 00:00:45.090
It ranges between 0 and 1.

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:47.500
It also has two definite peaks.

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:52.310
One at the value of zero, the other between 0.8 and 1.

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:56.420
Somewhere around 0.89 or 9.

00:00:57.620 --> 00:01:02.570
Notice that we had two variables in our model, but

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:06.140
we have changed that to a single variable x,

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:10.840
which is a combination derived from the two variables here.

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:14.910
This will let us use a single variable kernel density estimate,

00:01:14.910 --> 00:01:16.899
to build a model of x.

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:23.960
Form the derived variable corresponding to x, for the state of California.

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:25.570
Name it y.

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:27.840
Once you're done click on this box.
