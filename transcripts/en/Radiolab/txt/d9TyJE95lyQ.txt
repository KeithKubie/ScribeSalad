Speaker 1:          00:05          You're listening to radiolab from public radio,W , N, Y, s, t, e, n, n, P, R for Steve Strogatz mathematician who we sometimes have on the show. It all started with a pendulum.

Speaker 1:          00:23          He was sitting in math class. Our teacher handed us a little toy pendulum. Basically just a little device with a ball on the end of the string that was retractable. That is, you could change the length of the string like an old telescope, you know on that the pirate stretches out of spyglass. Click, click, click. You could make it longer in discreet clicks and then the teacher gave us a stopwatch and said, I want you to time how long it takes for this pendulum to swing back and forth 10 times. Okay, so I do the experiment, 10 swings, I record how, how many seconds it took. Then he says, now make the pendulum a little bit longer. One click longer, click do it again and as you might expect since now the string is longer, it takes a bit more time to make the 10 swings and I write down the number, click do it again, click do it again.

Speaker 1:          01:14          And I do this five or six times due to fleet plotting the the results on graph paper, which is what the experiment was really supposed to teach us how to use graph paper. So he's clicking, measuring, making little dot. Click measure.click measure dot soon the thing is filled with dots. That is when he noticed something, this spooky thing was happening, which is that the dots were falling on an arc on a curve. They weren't on a straight line. They fell on a particular curve. And I noticed that this curve was a curve I had seen before because I had just learned about it in Algebra class and it's called a parabola.

Speaker 2:          01:51          And this really gave me the creeps. I had this sort of feeling of the hairs on the back of my neck standing up because it was as if this inanimate thing, this pendulum, new Algebra and my 13 year old mind couldn't understand that. How could, how could this thing swinging back and forth know something about parabolas or how could that be built in then? And even creepier thought occurred to him.

Speaker 3:          02:14          Wait a second. This parabola on my paper, which is the same one as the math book is also out in the world. It's the, the shape that water makes coming out of a water fountain. It's also the shape of, you know, when you shoot a rocket into this guy and it slowly descends. It's that it was in that moment that I suddenly understood what people mean when they say there is a law of nature. Uh,

Speaker 2:          02:40          do you remember what it was that meet your heroes stand on and was it that you had peaked in and discovered a secret or did you just sent, we found the right answer it much closer to the first thing you said that there was this sort of veil over reality. A hidden universe that you couldn't see unless you knew math. It really felt like being led into some sort of secret society and that wasn't so much the point. I mean, it's not like I cared about being in this priesthood. It was, it's a very intimate, personal thing. This feeling of wonder of a sense of living in an comprehensible and beautiful universe

Speaker 3:          03:19          [inaudible]

Speaker 2:          03:20          go partly comprehensible. That's the beauty of it. I mean, if you're a lobster, you don't have this thought, right? And lobster doesn't get to think about the laws of nature. And so I've often thought to myself that it's a blessing that we live in a certain window of intelligence, that if we were infinitely smart, godlike, we'd have such powerful brains, we could see every implication of everything. So math wouldn't be fun for an a being that's too smart. And of course for the lobster that's not smart enough, math is no fun for them either. It's in this intermediate window where math and science become something to rejoice in.

Speaker 1:          03:56          Today's program is about kind of search search for order for patterns, hidden truth in truth, and it's about the scientists who go out looking for those things and sometimes find them, oh, what's that? And sometimes don't, I felt humiliated. I felt stupid. Question is what makes these people tick? And we're calling this show, why do I love the fly that's eating my brain? That'll make sense later. I'm Jad Abumrad. Hi, I'm Robert Krulwich. This is radio lab.

Speaker 1:          04:32          Okay, you ready? Yeah. Off we go. I think there's always been a desire to somehow categorize and classify the world around us. I remember it and when you were in, I don't know when it would be like in eighth grade when they, when the teacher comes in in general science and he pulls down the periodic table of elements or that. Yeah, sure. I mean that was one of the first times where I was like, yeah, I don't want to be a scientist. It's not for me. But for kids who love this kind of thing, take Oliver sacks for example. Yeah. Chad, you should come in. I should come in. Yeah. So a couple of years ago we had went to talk to Oliver sacks about something. Well, it's actually mostly you that was going to talk to them and I was just tagging along for the hell of it.

Speaker 1:          05:14          Yup. And for some reason we ended up in his bathroom. I tend to read it for this and that, maybe to look in a book or something. He seems to have facts and figures in his as well. There's a lot of us in there. I'm sorry. Sorry. And that's when we noticed you have a periodic chart in the bathroom, but he had a periodic Cuba, the elements on the wall in the bathroom. Here we are. Wow. How funny. Periodic table in the bathroom. But then he said, well, you know, if you go out into the couch, you'll see type of cushion cushions employed with the periodic table. And then he took us to his bedroom. Although I don't usually take people into my bedroom. Oh, he'll come where? He showed us his periodic table, comforter. I tend to sleep here right under tungsten.

Speaker 4:          05:59          But the cool part was when he took us to the living room where you had this, uh, describe what isn't before us here. And I'm like an Walter, it's like a little, a little dictionary Stan on top of, which was a beautiful mahogany box, a fine wooden box, like the size of a backgammon set, core periodic table of the elements is a very fine wooden box. And if you care to open it all right? It's, it's, it's uh, it's made of some sort of fine wood if it comes from Russia. All right. Is there a trick to opening this? Oh, [inaudible] okay. We've all seen the periodic table of being Alona chart, but I don't know the phrase box there. There were the shovel elements. These are all these and we have here like 90, some odd little, uh, little tubes, little solid UDL TV files. Almost all the elements.

Speaker 4:          06:55          We'll have arsenic this myth [inaudible] manganese, Merck can nitrogenic molybdenum goal. Since I am, for example, having my 77th birthday tomorrow and element 72 is half Niamh. There is a little half a million, a little rocks. Here's what they're, what they sound like. If he's grabbing me, I have coming to me, I hope it lives today and in got of half Hafnum which will be very much more satisfying. What would you do with an in gap that you can't do with the two little pebbles? Uh, I'll be able to hold it in my hand. I first love of chemistry had to do with the, the said she wants a year. We, one of the liquid elements me, I loved the colors around me. Lee Brown fluid, Ethan Luster, Pale Golden. That can be very, very beautiful. The, the physical properties is a gas trapped in a little vial. Yes. I wasn't, the one wouldn't want to drop that. Why not? I will, it's just not good to [inaudible] can I just jump in here for a second? Sure. Um, cause I, I, I really need to jump. But the thing that's really crazy about that box and this you don't get from, uh, from looking at a period of chart on a wall, is that all those elements, Boolean Bull, carbon, nitrogen, that's like the world. I mean everything that we can see and perceive. This table right here, the depth in my mouth, sky though ocean, the mountains, it's all need of some combination of elements.

Speaker 5:          08:23          That box and the box itself gives it all in deep, deep order.

Speaker 4:          08:32          I had noticed myself, I can't help noticing that the elements are organized in a very special sort of way. For example, excuse me for I have managed to not notice. I find it a little odd that you could organize them at all. I don't even know how to begin the process of figuring out they're related in well, well then then you are sort of um, recapitulating what you know, what everyone felt in the, in the early days, of course in the really early days people thought they were just four elements. The ancient notion of elements took the form of earth, fire and water. Basically the thought that the whole world could be composed of these four ingredients in different ways. But then in the 18th century, we're skipping ahead a bit. Chemists began to break things down into smaller pieces like wind became gases like oxygen and hydrogen and nitrogen. And Earth got divided up into things like sulfur, phosphorus ion, by the way, do this kind of investigating. Do you have to boil and pull and tongue and fry and steam and do things like that? All of the above. So to fast forward, after enough of this boiling and tugging and frying and steaming [inaudible] chemists got all the way down to the root of it, which was the Adam. That's really

Speaker 6:          09:58          what an element is. It's a particular kind of Adam. The problem was though, when chemists began to start measuring these atoms, they found that they were all different sizes and types. Like one would be heavy, another would be light. Third one would be really friendly, likes to link up with other atoms where as the fourth would be a loner and they would come in combinations like heavy, friendly, heavy, Shy, light, friendly, light shine. What was the pattern? That was the question. Could they fit all of these differences and similarities into one big,

Speaker 4:          10:29          you mentioned his name. You have to me here, show you a picture of the um, um, here's where we get to Oliver's hero. The Siberian big a mist I skew is cold. That would be Dimitri Mandalay, the great men delay of whom we will talk about. Oliver has a black and white picture of him on his kitchen cabinets. Man is not going to win any, any beauty content? No. He uh, he looks like a mixture between a Rasputin and um, uh, who do, I mean, what do you mean? He has a big nose, a shaggy, slightly unkempt white beard and mustache that goes all over the place. Piercing eyes, thick eyebrows and looks like he's in a hunchback position. Generally, if you met him on the sidewalk, you'd probably want to walk around him. Yeah. He didn't believe in wasting time going to a barber. Let me just ask you as the degree of your passion, when you look at this man, do you think he's a beautiful looking guy or do you see what I see? Um, I think mentally I've had a beautiful mind. All right. Okay. In 1860, uh, along dating 16th, there were trains going all over Russia and [inaudible] could afford to take trains. He was often on enormous journeys and to wile away the tide. Since he couldn't do chemical experiments or whatever, he would take playing cards with the name of various elements, their chemical and physical properties, and he would play

Speaker 6:          11:54          what he called chemical solitaire, sorting them for likeness or sorting. I'm fed, I, I don't know the details, but you know what we can imagine, right? Sure. Let's just say he's Day sitting there on the train. He's looking out the window to get these trees made of carbon carbon like a lake made of hydrogen and oxygen, oxygen, oxygen behind that amount should be made of silica, any shuffling the properties and the atomic weights in his mind. Wondering how do these things go to Karen? What's the pattern? Any shuffling, I'm shuffling, shuffling, shuffling traffic, and he did this for years until one night.

Speaker 4:          12:37          This we think is true. In February of 1869 he has said to have had a dream and his dream.

Speaker 6:          12:43          All the atoms have all the elements of all the world. If that wants a smaller points, dense warrants, the heavy warrants, the friendly ones to shine. Once they all begin to dance in his mind and then snapped

Speaker 4:          12:56          into a grid, he awoke with a vision of the periodic table.

Speaker 6:          13:02          Oh

Speaker 4:          13:04          dreams, which he then wrote on the back of an envelope.

Speaker 6:          13:12          [inaudible] is the thing about what he wrote on the back of that envelope is that it starts out so simply left to right. The Adam's just getting heavier and heavier Nav. You feel heavy on it, but every so often, and this is what he intuited in his dream, is it while they're getting heavy, are there other traits like whether they're shy or magnetic or whatever those traits, o repeat, UDL decree changed Berger, Uri, and every time they do start a new route, it brought with these repeat again out of this simple repeating structure. Mentally, if you get a table that you can read in a million ways, there are so many ways to read this table. I'm going to call this the PDL dictate that if you use your imagination,

Speaker 4:          13:58          you can see yourself in there. I was a rather shy kid with a, uh, difficulty forming relationships. Um, and I sometimes compared myself to the inert gases in nerd cancers are very isolated. They react with nothing because I felt that they too had difficulties forming relationships. But um, I did, uh, he has now left the chair and has moved to the library as taking on an a hugely thick, actually a dangerously thick book. This is the handbook of physics and chemistry. As you'll see it says 5,000 pages. I had a smaller version as a boy and I'm from brooding in this book. It seemed to me just possible that one of the inert gases, xenon might be seduced into combination by the most active element of all, which was flew in this lonely, lonely gas might find a partner somehow. Yeah. Did they ever get together?

Speaker 4:          15:00          In fact, it came to me with great joy when I found out her in the 1960s that a actually a Canadian chemist hadn't fact made, a flew out of xenon elemental love. And speaking of love, he then took us, let's come here to the living room. And he showed us a small painting in the painting. There was this dramatic figure of a bearded scowling character on the side of a mountain holding two stone tablets over his head. And the sky was filled with lightning. And who was it? It was Dimitri Mandalay. F when I heard of how mental AAF had, um, discovered the periodic table, I imagined men to laugh as a sort of Moses going up to a chemical Sinai and coming down with the tablets of the periodic law. And when I mentioned this fantasy to Peter Celkon, my friend, uh, an artist, he did this, imagine it, of picture of the young Mendillo f peaks of a chemical Sinai behind him holding aloft the tablets of the periodic table,

Speaker 7:          16:19          which raises maybe the deepest question of all, did Mendeley a think this up and impose it upon the world or was this pattern always there? In which case mentally you've just removed the veil and said,

Speaker 4:          16:32          oh, very, you are, is the periodic table a discovery or an invention? Is it a human construct or is it a revelation of the cosmic or divine order? Is it so to speak?

Speaker 7:          19:00          yeah. Hey, I'm Jad Abumrad and I'm Robert Krulwich. This is Radiolab. How do we continue with our ongoing appreciation of the Great Dimitri Mandalay

Speaker 9:          19:12          [inaudible]

Speaker 7:          19:15          [inaudible]

Speaker 3:          19:15          wow.

Speaker 7:          19:17          And, and, and let's also get back to the question that Oliver sacks asked about Dmitri Mendeleev before the break, which is when a scientist looks out at the world and sees a pattern, is that the scientist mind projected onto the chaos of the world? So is the discovery in the scientist or is it out there in the world, right? Meaning it just exists independent of us, doesn't care if we find it or not. Exactly. Is it a human construct or is it a level Asian of the cosmic or divine order? That's the question. And it can lead to some fairly well, sad and riveting. Do you

Speaker 10:         19:52          mind waiting for you? Ooh, this story comes to us from Alan Lightman, a theoretical physicist working out in cal tech. Once upon a time, Alan, when he was a scientist, he was working on a problem, a problem that had to deal with on astronomic object called a globular cluster, which is a collection of about a million stars. So he's got a Glob of stars orbiting each other. And the question he's asked is how do they hang together? Tell me a little bit about the gravity that links them. And he, he thought he'd made a discovery that was brand new. So I was in the process of writing up the paper. I'd done the calculations, I was writing the paper and I was in the library as one often does, putting in the footnotes and the references. And one of the things that you do in the references is you cite other people have done similar things and ideally you should do this before you start the problem. So I was flipping through some of the most current journals and I saw a title that looked alarmingly like the title that my article would have been. I got this terrible Pang, a bang society that went through me.

Speaker 3:          21:06          Uh,

Speaker 10:         21:06          so open up the journal and these two guys from Japan had solved the same problem that I had and I pulled out my notebook of results and started comparing my results against their results. And the numbers agreed to like three decimal places. So what they found was exactly what you had found. Well, they would have to find exactly what I'd found because this is the world of science and the world of science has this terrible precision. I was crestfallen. I was a so disappointed. I felt humiliated. I felt stupid.

Speaker 3:          21:47          Uh,

Speaker 10:         21:48          and then another sensation went through me and that was a feeling of amazement that these two guys on the other side of the planet with no communication with me sitting at their desks, worked on the same problem and had gotten the same results, the exact same results. You know, all of the philosophers like Bishop Barkley who said, it's all in our mind, they're all wrong. Any scientist, anywhere in the universe solving this problem would have gotten that answer. There. Willy is something outside of our bodies and independent of our minds, and this is both a wonderful thing and a terrible thing. It's a wonderful thing because there's a beauty to it. There's a feeling of power and control. But the tragedy of this, which I felt at the same time, is that what is the relevance of me as an individual person? If anybody else could have solved the same problem, then why was I needed? What is the meaning of my life? How do I leave my individuality on the world? Certainly not through science.

Speaker 3:          23:10          [inaudible]

Speaker 7:          23:10          so here's what happened. Alan gave up the practice of bench science and became a novelist. Einstein's dreams when the Pulitzer Prize, great book. That's his work. It couldn't have happened without him.

Speaker 10:         23:22          And that is a profound difference between the sciences and the arts.

Speaker 7:          23:28          Jeff, if the Ode to joy had not been in Beethoven's head, you don't think they would have come around? Yeah,

Speaker 10:         23:35          that's right. I, the tempest is not going to have been written by anybody but Shakespeare. The brief and wondrous life of Oscar Way oh by Juno Diaz, which is the novel I just finished, is going to have been written

Speaker 1:          23:46          by him. So it's good by science. But let's, um, let's argue the other side for just a second. Okay. There's, oops. Okay, I'm back. Um, there's an idea floating around that gives the scientists a little bit more. Um, I dunno, you'll probably like it. It comes from another physicist. Can you just introduce yourself?

Speaker 11:         24:04          Casey, forget you're talking today. I'm Paul Davis. I'm director of the beyond center for fundamental concepts in science at Arizona State University.

Speaker 1:          24:12          So Paul Davies starts with a basic question which humans have been asking forever. Why are we here? If you think about it, it's totally crazily improbable that we are here asking these questions that, I don't know,

Speaker 11:         24:25          13.7 billion years ago

Speaker 3:          24:31          [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          24:31          the universe is born and a shower particles that somehow cool in just the right way to form atoms, which somehow gather in just the right way to form stars and galaxies, a planet with sunrises and sunsets and just the right atmosphere to give rise to a creature that can look at the sunrises and sunsets and say,

Speaker 11:         24:50          wow, if the fundamental laws of physics or the initial conditions on the universe but then is slightly different, then there would be no life and no observers, no one to say. Wow. And the question is, is that a significant fact or just an incidental fact?

Speaker 1:          25:06          A lot of scientists would say, well, it's a fluke that we're here, that we have a mind that we ask these questions

Speaker 11:         25:11          and I think it's a big deal. We've been made privy to the fundamental nature of the universe. The rules on which the universe runs. It's basic laws. If we've just accident, why aren't we just here looking at the universe surviving but having no clue and the only way I can make sense of it is to suppose that there is some sort of link between the laws of the universe and the emergence of of life and consciousness that the existence of observers like ourselves is part of the explanatory story.

Speaker 1:          25:44          In other words, says Paul, the fact that we're here understanding at least trying to know the universe works on some scientific level. He thinks that's part of the grand scheme, that somehow the universe, the atoms in the universe need to be understood.

Speaker 11:         26:00          Well, the universe has engineered, it's its own self awareness that that the universe has thinking beings within it. You can think about it.

Speaker 1:          26:09          I'm going to compare the thinking beings. Like on the one hand maybe you had Cezanne painting a portrait and on the other you had Einstein doing an equation. It sounds like if understanding is the key that as you just said, that this theory would put the scientists ahead.

Speaker 11:         26:24          Well it does and I, you know, I'm always wary about saying that FFA are infuriating. My uh, out out Scotty for example, um, uh, that's not to diminish the value of art and poetry, but this thing we call silence is a, is a near miracle.

Speaker 12:         26:44          I'm not using miracle in the religious sense, but the fact we can do it I think is stupendous. We're incredibly privileged and I think there is some, uh, bigger, I want to say agenda, but you have to be very careful with these words, but certainly a scheme and that we judged that a scheme to be ingenious and beautiful for reasons we know not

Speaker 13:         27:10          [inaudible] seems to me that the earth would have a beautiful day and there was no one around who could reflect on all that beauty. Then what is it? It's there, but unappreciated. It's not quite there enough.

Speaker 1:          27:29          You know, in the Bible, God creates a bit of the universe every day. But at the end of each day, almost as a necessary function, God says, and it was good. He gives himself a grade, she gets way off a grade. So maybe this is just the Adam's way of inspiring itself because what is a scientist? It's just a bunch of atoms. Yeah. You know, it's a nice idea. But actually in the end I don't buy it, you know? No, cause he's saying that the purpose of the universe is to create thinking beings like us to examine it. And the best examiners of them all are the physicists. Well guess what? Here's a physicist. He is the very thing that he sort of, it's a little miss piggy. I, yeah. And I don't think anything that we've learned in science in past couple of hundred years would lead us to believe we are at the center of anything.

Speaker 1:          28:13          I think most scientists in the world would agree with you. And, and one more thing just on the level of aesthetics of beauty. Isn't it more beautiful to think that all of this is an accident? I hate that idea. Why hate you think that that all of this beauty coming into being by accident is better than in having some purpose? Yes. Because if it has a purpose, it means it's supposed to be here. And if it's supposed to be here, then it's just somehow little less. Um, amazing. Do you know what I mean? Yeah. I just think you're wrong. Okay. Okay. Thanks. Let's keep it moving. Yeah. Appreciating is the key according to Paul Davis will in science, that is sometimes harder than it sounds because what if you're out there in the world, you're on the cusp of a major discovery. It's right there in front of your face, but you happen to be looking the other way. For example, take the story. So I'm very excited to hear about your journey, but first tell me who you are. Okay. Uh, I'm Erica Lloyd.

Speaker 14:         29:12          I'm an editor and freelance writer. Testing looks like the mic is on and Erica recently took a trip with a bunch of scientists. Everything is working very far away. Quite a ways where exactly similar between Greenland and Siberia and all you're seeing every day is just lots and lots of ice. What's that? What's that like? Ice Is really beautiful. July 5th among the deck. We're looking in the Arctic Ocean. I mean it's just

Speaker 3:          29:42          one guy called. It is

Speaker 15:         29:44          cold Campfire Chili. Here it's, it's hovering around zero degrees. I mean sometimes when the sun is up and it's just sparked,

Speaker 1:          29:52          glean like diamonds,

Speaker 3:          29:54          look out. It's this mermaid thing. You get how isolated you are. Close to warmer clothes,

Speaker 15:         30:06          mittens. Maybe you can introduce yourself. Rob resewn. I'm a scientist at the woods hole oceanographic institution. He's sort of the main guy of this expedition. We have extra shoes like should I wear one? You're welcome to. So he raised the money. Millions of dollars of government funding. Go for him. Career wise, this is very important. This is it. When I was coming out of graduate school,

Speaker 16:         30:26          I was trying to think how was I going to make my mark in the scientific world. And you know, the more mature a field gets, the harder it is to do something important. And sometimes in graduate school it can feel like you're, you know, nine on bones as a scientist. And I'm the Gaggle Ridge has been a little bit of a, you know, in a sense it's, it's one of the final [inaudible]

Speaker 15:         30:52          frontiers. Wow. That's a shit petty. Nice. So we're going to the Gecko Ridge

Speaker 3:          31:08          [inaudible]

Speaker 15:         31:08          well, it's one of the great, unexplored places on the planet. Basically it's an Arctic mountain range, two or 300 miles from the north pole at the bottom of the ocean. It's like two and a half or three miles deep. Making matters worse in terms of getting there at the top of the ocean is covered in ice. Really, really thick this ice. But the thought is if you could somehow get there, get underneath the ice, get all the way down to the bottom of the ocean, you'll find volcanoes and you know where you have volcanoes, you might have hotsprings

Speaker 1:          31:38          where you have hot springs, you might have life. Just imagine blacks

Speaker 15:         31:44          really toxic, billowing out of a chimney on the sea floor, hot enough to melt lead Jesus. All manner of bizarre biological organisms making a little oasis around it. And what kind of creatures were they expecting to see? Weird kinds of, I mean everyone wanted to see a three eyed two words.

Speaker 1:          32:01          Yeah, really? Yeah. Is this a thing as a three I tuber? No, not yet. But the point is, is that every time that they've seen these hot springs in different parts of the planet, they've found completely new things. Something like 600 previously unheard of species like really strange looking Schramm with eyes that had moved to their backs and they have found tube worms. Huh? Big Ones that look sort of like plumes, the really cool looking and they're big. They have these little flower caps. In any case, this spot that they're going to for various geological reasons that I don't really understand. It might be the most interesting one of all, but no one's ever seen it,

Speaker 15:         32:36          huh? Huh? It's too early in the morning. 3:28 AM

Speaker 14:         32:42          [inaudible] minutes ago. As soon as that, but of course it took a few days to get to the first site is probably our colored location. This is a place where there was evidence of these fat,

Speaker 17:         32:54          so we thought, well, that's where we're going to start, Erica, how are they actually going to get through the ice to go down? Well, rob reef song thinking, how am I ever going to get to the cackle ridge? I had a newborn, a child, this is I guess 1996 I was giving her a bath and of course the whole layer of bath bubbles. I mean you couldn't see the bottom of the bath tub. Then what are the toys that she had was a sesame street submarine, the cookie monster, and Elmo is the captains and all this kind of stuff. And we were playing around with it. So we dove the submarine under the layer of bubbles. Oh wait a minute. The submarines underneath the bubbles. If we could develop robots, robots that could go under the Arctic ice cap to the sea floor, that would be a way to move beyond, you know, nine on bones and navy bring down some big game.

Speaker 14:         33:47          So finally, finally they're going to put this thing in the water. The verge of history. Man, I go down and gone all the way here, Rico, but the hell say we'd already gone. I'm in this shack that's sitting on the deck, a nice small heated enclosure and it's tiny. There's a a couple of Grad students and you know, I'm, I'm hanging in there and just to kind of squeeze into a corner. Everybody's got these big exposure suits on in case you fall into the water pretty quickly. It starts smelling like body odor and peanuts. You know, it's not there. People are doing laundry? No, they're not washing their fleets. Oh, the stress level. How's your stress?

Speaker 17:         34:21          And then they, they dropped the robot in [inaudible]

Speaker 14:         34:25          letting the baby go. No. It's like sending your child to preschool for the first time.

Speaker 18:         34:29          Okay. He is funny. And [inaudible]

Speaker 19:         34:32          so they're watching it go down deeper, deeper, deeper, deeper, deeper, deeper, deeper, deeper, deeper, deeper. What's going down, down, down. And they can watch on the computer monitor on the screen. What you're seeing is streams of data. So it just, just stayed. I know. Pictures, right? X, Y,Z , depth time, love of blah, blah, blah.

Speaker 14:         34:52          Good. Let me get this down. Coming up, the dropping is taking hours, hours, writing about the meter every five seconds.

Speaker 17:         34:58          Oh, so 12 meters per minute.

Speaker 14:         35:02          It goes now to 187 meters are now at 220 meters. 373 meters or at what? Cool. A hundred meters. Right now it's exciting to read the problem. The problem is that nobody should need music. I've got my iPod, you know, they start playing music. Let's do of course

Speaker 3:          35:28          [inaudible] and rolling. [inaudible]

Speaker 14:         35:45          [inaudible]. Okay, awesome. Yep. Six 41 OBL and right. Six 41 six 31 meters. Yes. So that's the new record. That's the depth record for an ATV in the Arctic. One or somebody go somebody to go for breakfast, I'll go and just, and that I'm not going anywhere. I want to thousand yen. So it's past the 1000 meter mark and it's moved on and makes his first mission goal a thousand meters. Everything's looking great. It's moving onto its next goal, 2,500 meters. And then

Speaker 17:         36:13          Beta boards, it's mentioned what? Oh, vehicle boarded the software died. Separate bug software, bug software. What's the matter with you? Can't you test the software before we come up here? So you're pissed off at this point? No, I wasn't because I knew how hard it was [inaudible] but I was so stressed out, so stressed out. I had facial tick tightness of my chest, labored breathing, eating my fingernails to my knuckles, you know, 10 years of, of effort, millions of dollars, his entire scientific career. All of that is on the line. You know, people kept asking me, of course, you know, Eric, I, you know, had aired a microphone there. How do you feel trying to kind of get me to take this kind of introspective look on it? And I even try, I like sat there, you know, one night after things had kind of died down and went on the front with the stars and said, okay, you know, feel the moment, dude. I can't feel the moment. We haven't had coms from the AUV for two and a half hours. I've gotta get back down there. You only have so many days on station to do what you've been planning 10 years to do. And Front to a board. Yeah. You're burning the clock. You know

Speaker 20:         37:23          Dick Dick, Dick, and you feel it, Dick Dick. You feel that tick, tick, tick. You can feel the Fuze tick, tick, tick, tick, tick.

Speaker 15:         37:31          We're not finding vents here, Dick. The clock is ticking. Let's move on to this next site. Well, we went through five times zones to get there. Took a week, took a week. Yeah. So you're back just chugging through the yes. For a week. Yep. Yep, Yep. Tick, tick, tick. And then, yeah.

Speaker 14:         37:51          Whoa. That's a guess. We're hitting some ice here. Everything's rocking everywhere.

Speaker 17:         37:55          Really, really big ice flow moved in and ran us out of town. Meaning you were stuck. Yeah. And a big traffic jam of ice chunks. Exactly. There's absolutely nothing we can do. Tick, tick, tick. We're just waiting in the eyes, you know, and just be fired, like, ugh. Or it didn't come up here to wait, let's keep working. Let's make something happen.

Speaker 14:         38:21          So the CTD team drops in their equipment because that's what they do. You know, if you're just sitting around in your, dropped you [inaudible]

Speaker 17:         38:27          you think so they were just stuck there and they're like, ah, let's throw it over the side, see what happens. Right.

Speaker 14:         38:34          And he found signals. Yeah.

Speaker 16:         38:36          Much stronger signals than they'd found anywhere else. Oh, see they got lucky. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, it's like interesting stuff everywhere is what it is kind of looking like. And this time, did the robot have a camera? Yeah. Ooh. They got all this video footage. Wonderful. Wonderful. High definition video. Superb. You know, and we could watch from the ship. We're seeing it, you know, in the control van in real time. Is it gonna be two berms is going to be clams. Is it going to be muscles? Is it going to be snails? This is Phil [inaudible], one of the engineers. Oh, over the next rock. Now there is going to be, there is going to be the next smoker, there's going to be the next Cali field with clams and mussels and who knows what we're going to see. And we go over this crater, the big rim, and then drop back down on the other side. And we found these fight fields, a whole hilltop fields just covered in this. This is so eerie. It was, it was, I haven't seen anything like that before. Yellow, yellow

Speaker 14:         39:34          fluffing stuff.

Speaker 15:         39:36          And it was really beautiful yellow fluffy stuff. Yeah. It was just everywhere floating around or were on the sea floor. We were seeing ski slopes, like cotton candy or something that might be growing in your yogurt. Whoa. What's that? Like? There'd be like a waterfall on it or I know one fall. Wow. Like it would just be coming down rock. So scarps and wow, kind of beautiful but but year. And it was

Speaker 17:         40:07          really, really frustrating what there was a certain faction on the ship that was really disappointed and they were really angry with me but telling me that I failed them really. Absolutely. In what way? That, you know, the combination of the AUV [inaudible] and our technology and my leadership hadn't resulted in finding [inaudible] worms. That's what we all wanted to see. Everyone wanted to see a three eyed to warm something really kind of spectacularly new and creepy and weird. And instead the new stuff that we found was, you know, this yellow fluffy stuff to the fluff was just like whatever. Well they was exciting cause it meant well, okay, hey what's going to eat this stuff? We're on the right trail, right? It's gotta be something eating this stuff. Nothing seemed to be eating no. Three I two worms

Speaker 9:          41:01          [inaudible]

Speaker 16:         41:02          and of course all of that is built on the supposition that there are three eyed two worms there to find, you know, the world is the world. The Arctic Ocean is the Arctic Ocean. It doesn't care what we want to see, what's there. Is there,

Speaker 9:          41:19          whoa.

Speaker 16:         41:20          So here's the interesting thing. Robbery. If sones comes back all that way thinking basically this trip that I've planned for the last 10 years was a bust. No vents, no two berms, nothing cool and amazing, just this fluff, whatever it is. But then they get back and they look at it more closely and they realize, okay, this stuff is microbes but not your run of the mill micro. These are some of the oldest known living organisms on earth. We were the first to see it. And what's funny is that like you didn't even know that until you got back. Thank you. Almost missed it. Yeah. Right. Are you going to be doing this again? Well, any more trips? Well that uh, that's a good question. I mean, uh, I'm broke now. Uh, the money's all gone field programs over, I am a, you know, a free falling a little bit, but the three eyed worm is still out there and it's still there for the taking mythic three, I'd worm the Unicorn of the Arctic

Speaker 9:          42:26          [inaudible]

Speaker 7:          42:26          thanks to rob brief zones. And Erica Lloyd and also before them, Katelyn walkin foots and the Brooklyn Tech Cheer Squad.

Radiolab is supported in part by the National Science Foundation and by the Alfred p Sloan Foundation, enhancing public understanding of science and technology in the modern world. More information aboutSloan@wwwdotsloan.org

Speaker 7:          43:08          hello, I'm Jad Abumrad. Hi, I'm Robert Krulwich. This is radio lab and we're talking about how scientists think about the world and appreciate, yeah, except appreciation. This is something that scientists do differently from the rest of us. And I think this next story is an act of appreciation. So different from the rest of us that it makes me want to Barf gag. Bring it once upon a time in a rainforest in Costa Rica and Central America, there was a little buck fly. It's a butterfly. Butterflies are here. He flies that live in moist, uh, tropical areas on route to, they're not like New York City flies. No, no, no. What a butterfly does is when a bot fly is pregnant and our butterfly was a pregnant female, but she has her baby flies up into the air carrying a baby, she sees in night hearing this feeder grabs actually grab on to the mosquito mid-flight and drops her baby on to the mosquito.

Speaker 7:          44:07          Why the mosquito? Well, because the mosquito is going to do something very important for the baby. But the mosquito of course is a mosquito. So it's looking to paint somebody right when the mosquito lands in a nice warm help potato potatoey math so she can have the Bob by baby is programmed to fall off into the mosquito bite and Mokolo. Wow, that's impressive. Completely. Yeah. And then mosquito probably has no idea of any of this. No idea at all. You got all that. Got It. Okay, so now I want to introduce you to a particular palpitating mammal that happened to be in Costa Rica on our very day.

Speaker 22:         44:44          I guess I was about 24 it was a 1973 his name is Jerry Coyne, 37 years, I guess 35 years. But I remember it like it was yesterday. This isn't an unexperienced that you forget easily working at Harvard as a Grad student at the time. Yeah, I was, I was doing a laboratory experiment on flies ironically. And, uh, there was a program for Harvard graduate students to go to the tropics for two months during the summer so they could get some experience in the field and learn something about the diversity of tropical nature.

Speaker 7:          45:19          So now we've got Jerry coin, Costa Rica walking through a forest, doing some researchers and some research and through the air you hear the distance sound of a mosquito getting closer and closer and closer to the Gerry,

Speaker 22:         45:35          right on the head, not too far from the crowd. And uh, and I scratch

Speaker 3:          45:40          [inaudible],

Speaker 22:         45:42          you know, it didn't go away when it got to be about the size of a pea. I consulted one of my fellow students,

Speaker 7:          45:47          this friend of his happened to be an entomologist. She climbed up onto a bunk bed

Speaker 22:         45:51          and she looked in my head, pulled the hair's bag, and she said, oh my God, there's something moving in there.

Speaker 22:         45:58          That's when I freaked out completely. I started running around the field station and going, Oh my God, Oh my God. I mean just physically running in circles is mosquito bite. It was a little hose or something protruding through the top of the mosquito bite and it was sort of wiggling around breathing tube, like a little straw. I was really completely freaked out. I mean, I had a a worm in my body. Nobody knew how to extract it. Why couldn't you just grab onto the, to the periscope part in Paul because like all marvels of evolution, the butt fly Maggot has devices to keep you from pulling it out because it makes his living in your body. So it has a pair of hooks on the anal and the other end that are dug into your flesh. So if you try to pull the thing out, it just digs in and you'll break it into, that is the thing you want to avoid because it can cause a serious infection.

Speaker 22:         46:47          Now you don't want to do that and you know you don't. But what you could do however is you could try what they called the meat cure. Put a slab of meat over the wound, strap it to you. I would have to have strapped, for example, a stake to my head which is not practicable and then the worm thinks that you know the worms breathing tube, which is went through the mosquito bite, it gets cut off and it's deprived of air. So it thinks that the steak is part of your flesh and it burrows up through the steak and when it comes out almost all the way, you can just remove this steak with a worm in it. But what a clever idea. Yeah. The idea of toiling in the tropical heat every day with a t-bone strapped to my head was not something that I wanted to do.

Speaker 7:          47:25          Meantime, it's some, it's causing problems. This thing is a terrible

Speaker 22:         47:30          itch and from time to time it would like move or switch and you'd feel this sort of sharp pain, your score or you can feel it grinding up against there. And when I went swimming or took a shower, we'd get sort of freaked out because it's air hole would be cut off and then it would really go nuts, you know, make a lot of pain. So, so I tried to avoid getting my head under water. Meanwhile, that lump was getting bigger and bigger until it sort of got noticeable.

Speaker 7:          47:56          Wait, how does it, what does it eating in order to get bigger and bigger? Well, it's a

Speaker 22:         48:02          um, yes. Um, sitting my muscles and tissue and my scalp. It's eating your flesh then. Yeah, it is. Oh, that's turning human flesh into fly flesh.

Speaker 7:          48:14          This fly. It's eating Jerry. So it's more and more.

Speaker 22:         48:18          Well it is Jerry. It is and that's the part that made me like it. So

Speaker 7:          48:24          Jerry and the part of Jerry that is now the butterfly leave Costa Rica and it's time to head back to Cambridge, Massachusetts at Harvard University where Jerry's the Grad student and uh, you know, he has to check things out.

Speaker 22:         48:36          So I went to the health clinic and you know, in about 10 minutes there was 20 doctors around me that nobody had ever seen anything like this at Harvard. They were all curious and poking and prodding and looking at it and doing an arm. But of course none of them knew what to do about it. Can I just decided screw it, you know, I'm gonna, I'm gonna let it come out and make the best of it. I, you know, enjoy it as much as I could and, and marvel at it. I mean, when you really think about it, it is amazing that an animal can take human flesh and turn it using its own genes into a fly. I mean, and you have to, marvel is so weird. Have you actually, I mean, I didn't even think this misbehavior, it might seem weird to the lay person, but to biologist, it's sort of absolutely normal to, you know, be very curious about something.

Speaker 22:         49:16          You know, I make my living on flies, I've worked with fruit flies, I'm a geneticist and, and here's the fly making. It's living on me. And I was getting more and more curious. I wanted to see what it looked like when it came out. I didn't want to kill it. What about girls? I mean, assuming you're dating. So like, yeah, can just like a total turnoff. Say Hi, this is me and my maggot. Well, I was, you know, I was dating a nurse at the time and this is, this is the good thing about it. The nurse was, uh, actually quite fascinated with this.

Speaker 7:          49:41          Huh? I thought it was disgusting. Cheryl Rogerson was Jerry's friend. She inspected the fly. Did you give it a name? No. No. Jerry May have felt that way about it, but uh, no I didn't. This was more of a scientific experience. This is something you were, it was okay with you. Well, I don't remember being informed that there were any other options. I thought, I thought this is just what had to happen. So a couple of weeks pass and the butterfly is just getting, yeah,

Speaker 22:         50:08          bigger and bigger and bigger. It goes from

Speaker 7:          50:09          Jelly bean size to something like the size of an egg. An Egg. Yeah. It was pretty big. Like a quail egg. Well, he's covering it now with a baseball cap, which is maybe one reason why they decided to go to Fenway park one particular evening. That is correct.

Speaker 9:          50:26          [inaudible]

Speaker 22:         50:26          yeah, there's the Psych Yankees game.

Speaker 6:          50:28          I wasn't gonna miss that. And uh, every once in a while I would rub my head, I mean, throughout this whole gestation of this thing, just to check on it. And during the game when I wrote from my head, I felt something coming out of the lump. Jerry kept saying, oh my gosh, oh my gosh, it's coming out. I can feel it. So was this a little distracting? Uh, yeah.

Speaker 3:          50:49          A foul ball came up where you were sitting in it

Speaker 6:          50:53          damn. And one of those wooden seats at Fenway and we've narrowly escaped getting hit because we really weren't paying much attention to the game at all.

Speaker 3:          51:03          [inaudible]

Speaker 22:         51:03          but it took a long time. I mean, it started at the game and then it went on, started the game and, and continued on until the evening

Speaker 6:          51:10          back to Jerry's apartment. And he kept reaching up and checking to feel the lump and we were just hanging out and

Speaker 22:         51:17          Morris gave in that and he said he reached up and said,

Speaker 3:          51:24          it's gone.

Speaker 22:         51:26          We've gotta find it. I turned on the light and there was on the pillow and it was horrifying. What did it look like? Is it a weekly little wormy thing?

Speaker 6:          51:35          It's sort of bulbous on one end and then it tapers down to a little tail. It's white fat, white Grub, warm inch and a half long, and it has little black tea.

Speaker 9:          51:48          [inaudible]

Speaker 22:         51:48          no, I thought, oh my goodness. That's what was in my head. Had I known that I might've been more freaked out. When you are greeting your baby there, did you have a feeling of pride or just, well, no extreme curiosity. Um, the one thing that was extremely striking to me was that it's, it's exit was completely painless. Um, you know, it's painful when it's in there, but when it comes out, it does so very painlessly and that's another evolutionary phenomenon. Of course it's the, if the worm was did it painfully and exited, then the horse or the monkey or whoever it's infecting would just slap it and kill it. So what did you do when you had the baby there on the pillow then? I decided I was going to try to rear into an adult fly, you know, um, aside what you do. So I, I had prepared a jar of sterile sand. I took the worm and I drafted into the sand and put the top on with air holes and hope that, um, it would, pew paid, but unfortunately it died. Did you get sad? I was extremely sad, you know, in the temperate zone in Boston about flight is not gonna make it and just can't live. And so it was doomed from the start, but I wanted to see it complete its life cycle. And unfortunately it didn't quite make it so

Speaker 22:         53:02          I did the best they could with what I knew. You know, I, I think it's as an added some richness to my life. It really did. People still get completely horrified when I tell them this story, even though to me is, you know, it's sort

Speaker 23:         53:26          of a nice store.

Speaker 7:          53:32          Jerry [inaudible] works at the University of Chicago and his forthcoming book is called why evolution is true and we have time for one more story. A couple of years ago, I sat down with one of the great bug scientist, insect scientist in the world. His name is Tom Eisner. He teaches up at Cornell and has taught more scientists to love insects than anyone in the world probably. And I guess I wondered if you spent your whole life having feelings and very sophisticated feelings about tiny, almost alien lifeforms. How does that happen? We spoke at the 92nd street y in Manhattan.

Speaker 24:         54:11          It's an insects. Can you remember when it began? According to my parents, when I first stood on my feet, great. Right here. The Button was box MD, Beatles, caterpillars, ants, termites, cockroaches. I've picked them up. I learned quickly not to put them all in my mouth. Uh, I kept, I'm in my room. My Room was Zune. You were born in Berlin, correct? From a Jewish family. You were, what, about three years old when you left or thereabouts? Three years old went to Spain. So you went from the Nazis in Berlin to Spain? Yes. And the Spanish civil war fled for France. My parents decided we should really start somewhere else and we went to South America. And that was an entomological paradigm.

Speaker 24:         55:06          Every living organism has some sort of coder. You can build these up in your memory. And I used to take a whiff of that in second classify in my mind's eye, according to what place smells like Caterpillar and Beatles. And do you ever dream of insect? Yes. Yeah. I tend to dream that I am in insect. What does that mean? That your dream that you are in, in Sec? I mean you were scurrying and walking upside down on the ceilings or leave even escaping. Sweating's um, the weirdest situation that I ever got into in a dream was like dream that it was an insect. And I was telling another insect that occasionally dreamed that I'm a human. That's your dream. Insects were somehow my great love. It was very much a loner. And, uh, if I didn't have a room full of insects live, I was unhappy. Tom, I wanted to ask you,

Speaker 7:          56:11          and at this moment, uh, Oliver sacks who was on the stage with us, he asked Tom this question

Speaker 24:         56:15          whether you feel that insects respond to your, you know, whether, whether you feel them sort of polling and whether they, um, they know that you're gentle and reliable. And for them, you know, it's, it's a, it's a good question. I don't, I don't presume to read responses on the part of the insects, but the older I get, the more difficult I find it to experiment with them and they were ways that killed them. Um, bombardier beetles can live four one, two up to three years in your lab. You become very attached to them. You give them names and when they die, it's an event. So you must somehow have moments where you feel that things are going on in that tiny little brain that they have secrets hidden up their sleeves that uh, they might reveal. If you find a common language, I find that I can love nature no matter how distant the individual organisms are from me, but I reach out and hope that I can shorten the distance and create some feeling of coexistence.

Speaker 16:         57:40          Tom Eisner's book is called for the love of insects. It's really what it's called. Yeah. Well, we should go check our website, radiolab.org for more information, and you can always send us an email@radiolabatwnyc.org Radiolab is one word. Yes, it is. [inaudible] boom, rod. I'm Robert Krulwich.
