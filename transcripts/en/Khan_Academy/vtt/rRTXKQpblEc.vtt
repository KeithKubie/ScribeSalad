00:00:00.339 --> 00:00:01.561
- [Voiceover] We know that we can find

00:00:01.561 --> 00:00:03.454
the area of a rectangle by multiplying

00:00:03.454 --> 00:00:05.053
the base times the height.

00:00:05.053 --> 00:00:08.184
The area of a rectangle is
equal to base times height.

00:00:08.184 --> 00:00:09.804
In another video, we saw that,

00:00:09.804 --> 00:00:12.190
if we're looking at the
area of a parallelogram,

00:00:12.190 --> 00:00:14.253
and we also know the length of a base,

00:00:14.253 --> 00:00:16.042
and we know its height, then the area

00:00:16.042 --> 00:00:18.659
is still going to be base times height.

00:00:18.659 --> 00:00:19.890
Now, it's not as obvious when you look

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:21.817
at the parallelogram, but in that video,

00:00:21.817 --> 00:00:24.987
we did a little manipulation of the area.

00:00:24.987 --> 00:00:26.055
We said, "Hey, let's take this

00:00:26.055 --> 00:00:28.086
"little section right over here."

00:00:28.086 --> 00:00:31.256
So we took that little
section right over there,

00:00:31.256 --> 00:00:35.726
and then we move it over
to the right-hand side,

00:00:35.726 --> 00:00:37.618
and just like that, you see that,

00:00:37.618 --> 00:00:39.963
as long as the base and
the height is the same,

00:00:39.963 --> 00:00:41.786
as this rectangle here,
I'm able to construct

00:00:41.786 --> 00:00:44.422
the same rectangle by
moving that area over,

00:00:44.422 --> 00:00:46.384
and that's why the area
of this parallelogram

00:00:46.384 --> 00:00:47.858
is base times height.

00:00:47.858 --> 00:00:50.854
I didn't add or take away
area, I just shifted area

00:00:50.854 --> 00:00:53.187
from the left-hand side
to the right-hand side

00:00:53.187 --> 00:00:55.460
to show you that the area
of that parallelogram

00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:58.159
was the same as this
area of the rectangle.

00:00:58.159 --> 00:01:01.317
It's still going to be base times height.

00:01:01.317 --> 00:01:03.693
So hopefully that convinces you

00:01:03.693 --> 00:01:07.595
that the area of a parallelogram
is base times height,

00:01:07.595 --> 00:01:09.139
because we're now going to use that

00:01:09.139 --> 00:01:13.591
to get the intuition for
the area of a triangle.

00:01:13.591 --> 00:01:16.656
So let's look at some triangles here.

00:01:16.656 --> 00:01:17.852
So that is a triangle,

00:01:17.852 --> 00:01:20.853
and we're given the base and the height,

00:01:20.853 --> 00:01:21.915
and we're gonna try to think about

00:01:21.915 --> 00:01:25.392
what's the area of this
triangle going to be,

00:01:25.392 --> 00:01:26.390
and you can imagine it's going to be

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:28.480
dependent on base and height.

00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:29.989
Well, to think about that,

00:01:29.989 --> 00:01:33.856
let me copy and paste this triangle.

00:01:33.856 --> 00:01:38.627
So let me copy, and then let me paste it,

00:01:38.627 --> 00:01:39.986
and what I'm gonna do is,

00:01:39.986 --> 00:01:41.425
so now I have two of the triangles,

00:01:41.425 --> 00:01:43.387
so this is now going to be twice the area,

00:01:43.387 --> 00:01:45.918
and I'm gonna rotate it around,

00:01:45.918 --> 00:01:50.918
I'm gonna rotate it around like that,

00:01:52.025 --> 00:01:55.694
and then add it to the
original area, and you see

00:01:55.694 --> 00:01:57.958
something very interesting is happening.

00:01:57.958 --> 00:02:01.174
I have now constructed a parallelogram.

00:02:01.174 --> 00:02:03.252
I have now constructed a parallelogram

00:02:03.252 --> 00:02:06.619
that has twice the area
of our original triangle,

00:02:06.619 --> 00:02:08.279
'cause I have two of
our original triangles

00:02:08.279 --> 00:02:09.754
right over here, you saw me do it,

00:02:09.754 --> 00:02:12.354
I copied and pasted it,
and then I flipped it over

00:02:12.354 --> 00:02:15.559
and I constructed the parallelogram.

00:02:15.559 --> 00:02:17.358
Now why is this interesting?

00:02:17.358 --> 00:02:20.621
Well, the area of the
entire parallelogram,

00:02:20.621 --> 00:02:23.453
the area of the entire parallelogram

00:02:23.453 --> 00:02:28.388
is going to be the length of
this base times this height.

00:02:28.388 --> 00:02:29.478
You also have height written

00:02:29.478 --> 00:02:31.694
with the "h" upside down over here.

00:02:31.694 --> 00:02:32.994
It's going to be base times height.

00:02:32.994 --> 00:02:35.758
That's going to be for the
parallelogram, for the entire--

00:02:35.758 --> 00:02:37.952
let me draw a parallelogram
right over here.

00:02:37.952 --> 00:02:40.587
That's going to be the area
of the entire parallelogram.

00:02:40.587 --> 00:02:43.420
So what would be the area
of our original triangle?

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:48.354
What would be the area
of our original triangle?

00:02:48.354 --> 00:02:51.524
Well, we already saw that this
area of the parallelogram,

00:02:51.524 --> 00:02:53.823
it's twice the area of
our original triangle.

00:02:53.823 --> 00:02:54.926
So our original triangle is just

00:02:54.926 --> 00:02:56.725
going to have half the area.

00:02:56.725 --> 00:02:59.419
So this area right over
here is going to be

00:02:59.419 --> 00:03:02.426
one half the area of the parallelogram.

00:03:02.426 --> 00:03:06.485
One half base-- let me
do those same colors.

00:03:06.485 --> 00:03:10.757
One half base times height.

00:03:10.757 --> 00:03:13.091
One half base times height.

00:03:13.091 --> 00:03:15.157
And you might say, "OK, maybe
it worked for this triangle,

00:03:15.157 --> 00:03:18.118
"but I wanna see it work
for more triangles."

00:03:18.118 --> 00:03:19.778
And so, to help you there,

00:03:19.778 --> 00:03:21.856
I've added another
triangle right over here,

00:03:21.856 --> 00:03:23.853
you could do this as an obtuse triangle,

00:03:23.853 --> 00:03:26.721
this angle right over here
is greater than 90 degrees,

00:03:26.721 --> 00:03:27.661
but I'm gonna do the same trick.

00:03:27.661 --> 00:03:30.064
We have the base, and
then we have the height.

00:03:30.064 --> 00:03:30.993
Here, you can think of,

00:03:30.993 --> 00:03:33.861
if you start at this
point right over here,

00:03:33.861 --> 00:03:35.928
and if you drop a ball,

00:03:35.928 --> 00:03:39.051
the length that the ball goes,
if you had a string here,

00:03:39.051 --> 00:03:40.508
to kind of get to the ground level,

00:03:40.508 --> 00:03:41.791
you could view this as the ground level

00:03:41.791 --> 00:03:44.554
right over there, that that's
going to be the height,

00:03:44.554 --> 00:03:46.818
it's not sitting in the
triangle like we saw last time,

00:03:46.818 --> 00:03:49.760
but it's still the height of the triangle.

00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:51.060
If this was a building of some kind,

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:52.024
you'd say, "Well, this is the height."

00:03:52.024 --> 00:03:53.928
How far off the ground is it?

00:03:53.928 --> 00:03:55.484
Well, what's the area of this going to be?

00:03:55.484 --> 00:03:56.424
Well, you can imagine,

00:03:56.424 --> 00:03:58.990
it's going to be one
half base times height.

00:03:58.990 --> 00:04:00.917
How do we feel good about that?

00:04:00.917 --> 00:04:05.724
Well, let's do the same magic here.

00:04:05.724 --> 00:04:09.520
So let me copy and paste this,

00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:12.353
so I'm gonna copy and then paste it.

00:04:12.353 --> 00:04:14.489
Whoops, that didn't work.

00:04:14.489 --> 00:04:19.489
Let me copy, and then paste it.

00:04:20.294 --> 00:04:23.185
And so, I have two of these triangles now,

00:04:23.185 --> 00:04:25.484
but I'm gonna flip this one over,

00:04:25.484 --> 00:04:28.514
so that I can construct a parallelogram.

00:04:28.514 --> 00:04:31.951
So I'm gonna flip it over,
and move it over here,

00:04:31.951 --> 00:04:34.191
I'm gonna have to rotate
it a little bit more.

00:04:34.191 --> 00:04:37.628
So, I think you get the general idea.

00:04:37.628 --> 00:04:39.694
So now I have constructed a parallelogram

00:04:39.694 --> 00:04:43.061
that has twice the area
of our original triangle.

00:04:43.061 --> 00:04:48.019
It has twice the area of
our original triangle.

00:04:48.019 --> 00:04:49.157
And so, if I talked about

00:04:49.157 --> 00:04:51.188
the area of the entire parallelogram,

00:04:51.188 --> 00:04:56.188
it would be base times the
height of the parallelogram.

00:04:57.585 --> 00:04:59.327
Base times the height
of the parallelogram.

00:04:59.327 --> 00:05:02.160
But if we're only talking
about the area of --

00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:06.455
If we're only talking about this area

00:05:06.455 --> 00:05:08.952
right over here, which
is our original triangle,

00:05:08.952 --> 00:05:11.192
it's going to be half the
area of the parallelogram,

00:05:11.192 --> 00:05:12.882
so it's gonna be one half of that.

00:05:12.882 --> 00:05:14.786
So our area of our original triangle

00:05:14.786 --> 00:05:17.352
is one half base times height.

00:05:17.352 --> 00:05:18.861
So hopefully that makes
you feel pretty good

00:05:18.861 --> 00:05:21.218
about this formula that
you will see in geometry,

00:05:21.218 --> 00:05:23.888
that area of a triangle is
one half base times height,

00:05:23.888 --> 00:05:26.117
while the area of a
rectangle or a paralleogram

00:05:26.117 --> 00:05:28.701
is going to be base times height.
