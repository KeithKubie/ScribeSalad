making Columbia content publicly
 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:57.890
making Columbia content publicly
available and I think I'm going to be

00:00:57.890 --> 00:00:57.900
available and I think I'm going to be
 

00:00:57.900 --> 00:01:02.030
available and I think I'm going to be
kind of a poster child for that uh but I

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:02.040
kind of a poster child for that uh but I
 

00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:06.230
kind of a poster child for that uh but I
must say I think that having stuff

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:06.240
must say I think that having stuff
 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:10.849
must say I think that having stuff
publicly available is really good and my

00:01:10.849 --> 00:01:10.859
publicly available is really good and my
 

00:01:10.859 --> 00:01:14.139
publicly available is really good and my
sense is that if we had a dozen

lectures available for free online that
 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:20.630
lectures available for free online that
would increase the number of applicants

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640
would increase the number of applicants
 

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:25.550
would increase the number of applicants

and the Pacific Islands so I want to

00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:03.210
and the Pacific Islands so I want to

is Africa and the other is the history

is Africa and the other is the history
of early seafaring so let's start with

00:04:15.830 --> 00:04:15.840
of early seafaring so let's start with
 

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:21.170
of early seafaring so let's start with
Africa uh the argument made by the

00:04:21.170 --> 00:04:21.180
Africa uh the argument made by the
 

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:25.790
Africa uh the argument made by the
learner I just mentioned was that the

00:04:25.790 --> 00:04:25.800
learner I just mentioned was that the
 

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:27.980
learner I just mentioned was that the
his that history is based on written

00:04:27.980 --> 00:04:27.990
his that history is based on written
 

00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:31.070
his that history is based on written
documents there are no written documents

00:04:31.070 --> 00:04:31.080
documents there are no written documents
 

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:35.060
documents there are no written documents
and therefore you have to wait a while

00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:35.070
and therefore you have to wait a while
 

00:04:35.070 --> 00:04:38.120
and therefore you have to wait a while

Rome it was dry and you have very

00:13:13.680 --> 00:13:13.690
Rome it was dry and you have very
 

00:13:13.690 --> 00:13:15.480
Rome it was dry and you have very

agriculturally productive then you go

00:13:25.620 --> 00:13:25.630
agriculturally productive then you go
 

00:13:25.630 --> 00:13:29.370

then you have a range of hills on the
 

00:13:29.380 --> 00:13:31.740
then you have a range of hills on the
southern edge of the towel you go over

00:13:31.740 --> 00:13:31.750
southern edge of the towel you go over
 

00:13:31.750 --> 00:13:33.900
southern edge of the towel you go over
the hills and then you have a quite a

00:13:33.900 --> 00:13:33.910
the hills and then you have a quite a
 

00:13:33.910 --> 00:13:36.569
the hills and then you have a quite a
steep descent and then you're in the

00:13:36.569 --> 00:13:36.579
steep descent and then you're in the
 

00:13:36.579 --> 00:13:41.660
steep descent and then you're in the
sand and if so it's a very dramatic

00:13:41.660 --> 00:13:41.670

going across the northern Sahara let's

00:13:54.750 --> 00:13:54.760
going across the northern Sahara let's
 

00:13:54.760 --> 00:13:56.850

Mountains you go down to the tail go up
 

00:14:00.780 --> 00:14:02.150
Mountains you go down to the tail go up
a little bit and now you're down in the

historically from the oases that you
 

00:14:49.020 --> 00:14:52.160
historically from the oases that you
have in the central Sahara so you keep

00:14:52.160 --> 00:14:52.170
have in the central Sahara so you keep
 

00:14:52.170 --> 00:14:58.700
have in the central Sahara so you keep
on going across the Sahara and you get

00:14:58.700 --> 00:14:58.710
on going across the Sahara and you get
 

00:14:58.710 --> 00:15:02.120
on going across the Sahara and you get
to high mountains you get past the high

to high mountains you get past the high
 

00:15:02.130 --> 00:15:05.260
to high mountains you get past the high

they had a hard time defining when they
 

00:15:24.840 --> 00:15:26.900
they had a hard time defining when they
would find the Sahara and they finally

00:15:26.900 --> 00:15:26.910
would find the Sahara and they finally
 

00:15:26.910 --> 00:15:29.990
would find the Sahara and they finally
decided on one particular weed they said

the the southern extent is a variable

00:15:48.200 --> 00:15:48.210
the the southern extent is a variable
 

00:15:48.210 --> 00:15:50.320
the the southern extent is a variable
the northern extent some seems to be

that affected the southern Sahara and in

00:16:14.900 --> 00:16:14.910
that affected the southern Sahara and in
 

00:16:14.910 --> 00:16:16.880
that affected the southern Sahara and in
particular affected these mountainous

00:16:16.880 --> 00:16:16.890
particular affected these mountainous
 

00:16:16.890 --> 00:16:20.090
particular affected these mountainous
areas in the central Sahara so you have

00:16:20.090 --> 00:16:20.100
areas in the central Sahara so you have
 

00:16:20.100 --> 00:16:22.970
areas in the central Sahara so you have
us a sequence of mountainous areas that

00:16:22.970 --> 00:16:22.980
us a sequence of mountainous areas that
 

00:16:22.980 --> 00:16:28.340
us a sequence of mountainous areas that
go from from western Sudan across Chad

00:16:28.340 --> 00:16:28.350
go from from western Sudan across Chad
 

00:16:28.350 --> 00:16:35.870
go from from western Sudan across Chad
across Nazaire and southern Algeria and

00:16:35.870 --> 00:16:35.880
across Nazaire and southern Algeria and
 

00:16:35.880 --> 00:16:44.410
across Nazaire and southern Algeria and
then across Mauritania and Mali to some

00:16:44.410 --> 00:16:44.420
then across Mauritania and Mali to some
 

00:16:44.420 --> 00:16:48.319
then across Mauritania and Mali to some
extent and this hilum sequence of areas

00:16:48.319 --> 00:16:48.329
extent and this hilum sequence of areas
 

00:16:48.329 --> 00:16:54.819

is the heartland of the Saharan rock art

00:16:54.819 --> 00:16:54.829
is the heartland of the Saharan rock art
 

00:16:54.829 --> 00:16:57.199
is the heartland of the Saharan rock art
so the rock art of the Sahara is

00:16:57.199 --> 00:16:57.209
so the rock art of the Sahara is
 

00:16:57.209 --> 00:17:02.269
so the rock art of the Sahara is

southern Sahara and that as desiccation
 

00:17:29.340 --> 00:17:32.690
southern Sahara and that as desiccation
occurred people moved south rather than

00:17:32.690 --> 00:17:32.700
occurred people moved south rather than
 

00:17:32.700 --> 00:17:37.549
occurred people moved south rather than
north because the people you know this

00:17:37.549 --> 00:17:37.559
north because the people you know this
 

00:17:37.559 --> 00:17:39.590
north because the people you know this
area up here doesn't appear to have

00:17:39.590 --> 00:17:39.600
area up here doesn't appear to have
 

00:17:39.600 --> 00:17:41.650
area up here doesn't appear to have
gotten as much rainfall as the area

00:17:41.650 --> 00:17:41.660
gotten as much rainfall as the area
 

00:17:41.660 --> 00:17:44.020
gotten as much rainfall as the area
further to the south

00:17:44.020 --> 00:17:44.030
further to the south
 

00:17:44.030 --> 00:17:52.070
further to the south
so in this wetter period for a long time

00:17:52.070 --> 00:17:52.080
so in this wetter period for a long time
 

00:17:52.080 --> 00:17:58.520
so in this wetter period for a long time
all you had were a rock art and almost

00:17:58.520 --> 00:17:58.530
all you had were a rock art and almost
 

00:17:58.530 --> 00:18:03.049
all you had were a rock art and almost
no dateable archaeology now that is

00:18:03.049 --> 00:18:03.059
no dateable archaeology now that is
 

00:18:03.059 --> 00:18:06.320
no dateable archaeology now that is
beginning to change and and really I

00:18:06.320 --> 00:18:06.330
beginning to change and and really I
 

00:18:06.330 --> 00:18:08.690
beginning to change and and really I
think one of the things you have to keep

00:18:08.690 --> 00:18:08.700
think one of the things you have to keep
 

00:18:08.700 --> 00:18:09.890
think one of the things you have to keep
in mind you're something I mentioned in

00:18:09.890 --> 00:18:09.900
in mind you're something I mentioned in
 

00:18:09.900 --> 00:18:11.650
in mind you're something I mentioned in
earlier lecture that you know

00:18:11.650 --> 00:18:11.660

archaeology really starts where it's

00:18:15.409 --> 00:18:15.419
archaeology really starts where it's
 

00:18:15.419 --> 00:18:18.320
archaeology really starts where it's
easiest you know where there's a

00:18:18.320 --> 00:18:18.330
easiest you know where there's a
 

00:18:18.330 --> 00:18:21.440
easiest you know where there's a
Starbucks and you come there no trees on

00:18:21.440 --> 00:18:21.450
Starbucks and you come there no trees on
 

00:18:21.450 --> 00:18:23.510
Starbucks and you come there no trees on
the ground and the mound is really

00:18:23.510 --> 00:18:23.520
the ground and the mound is really
 

00:18:23.520 --> 00:18:24.390
the ground and the mound is really
obvious and you

00:18:24.390 --> 00:18:24.400
obvious and you
 

00:18:24.400 --> 00:18:26.850
obvious and you
just go and dig it up and send it off to

00:18:26.850 --> 00:18:26.860
just go and dig it up and send it off to
 

00:18:26.860 --> 00:18:28.650
just go and dig it up and send it off to

my important work particularly in the

00:18:37.890 --> 00:18:37.900
my important work particularly in the
 

00:18:37.900 --> 00:18:41.970

Americas and in Southeast Asia and to
 

00:18:41.980 --> 00:18:47.580
Americas and in Southeast Asia and to
some degree in Africa so now we have

some degree in Africa so now we have
 

00:18:47.590 --> 00:18:53.370
some degree in Africa so now we have
some archaeology and it reveals things

astronomical observation but it is so
 

00:21:02.649 --> 00:21:05.460

consistent to find alignments that

00:21:05.460 --> 00:21:05.470
consistent to find alignments that

from outer space uh know that that that

very long way now here of course it's

00:21:28.259 --> 00:21:28.269
very long way now here of course it's
 

00:21:28.269 --> 00:21:30.049
very long way now here of course it's
interesting because it goes it's pre its

00:21:30.049 --> 00:21:30.059
interesting because it goes it's pre its
 

00:21:30.059 --> 00:21:33.990
interesting because it goes it's pre its
pre-agricultural so the people who say

00:21:33.990 --> 00:21:34.000
pre-agricultural so the people who say
 

00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:35.909

oh once you start growing crops you'll

00:21:35.909 --> 00:21:35.919
oh once you start growing crops you'll
 

00:21:35.919 --> 00:21:37.159
oh once you start growing crops you'll
have to keep track of the seasons

00:21:37.159 --> 00:21:37.169
have to keep track of the seasons
 

00:21:37.169 --> 00:21:39.779
have to keep track of the seasons
because you can't really figure out what

00:21:39.779 --> 00:21:39.789
because you can't really figure out what
 

00:21:39.789 --> 00:21:42.899
because you can't really figure out what
comes after fall maybe it's summer again

00:21:42.899 --> 00:21:42.909
comes after fall maybe it's summer again
 

00:21:42.909 --> 00:21:45.899
comes after fall maybe it's summer again
and get spring no you know it it isn't

something as simple-minded as keeping
 

00:21:49.029 --> 00:21:50.840
something as simple-minded as keeping
track of the seasons but rather

thing probably in my view something
 

00:21:56.769 --> 00:21:59.869
thing probably in my view something
closer to the notion of the macrocosm

practical now one of the interesting
 

00:22:09.100 --> 00:22:11.909
practical now one of the interesting
things about this stone circle which was

to here you've got the stone circle the
 

00:22:37.419 --> 00:22:41.009

00:28:21.850 --> 00:28:21.860
domesticated in Africa separately from
 

00:28:21.860 --> 00:28:24.909
domesticated in Africa separately from
being domesticated in the Middle East so

00:28:24.909 --> 00:28:24.919
being domesticated in the Middle East so
 

00:28:24.919 --> 00:28:27.549
being domesticated in the Middle East so
in other words you go to 7,000 BC where

00:28:27.549 --> 00:28:27.559
in other words you go to 7,000 BC where
 

00:28:27.559 --> 00:28:31.000
in other words you go to 7,000 BC where
you have abundant camel capital remains

00:28:31.000 --> 00:28:31.010
you have abundant camel capital remains
 

00:28:31.010 --> 00:28:32.740
you have abundant camel capital remains

catalhoyuk and Turkey so in Turkey we

00:28:53.950 --> 00:28:53.960
catalhoyuk and Turkey so in Turkey we
 

00:28:53.960 --> 00:28:58.570
catalhoyuk and Turkey so in Turkey we
can see a cattle being you know exciting

00:28:58.570 --> 00:28:58.580
can see a cattle being you know exciting
 

00:28:58.580 --> 00:29:00.610

a certain kind of reverence you'll have

a certain kind of reverence you'll have

the crania of cattle embedded in the
 

00:29:06.109 --> 00:29:08.529
the crania of cattle embedded in the

walls or the horn sticking out and this
 

00:29:08.539 --> 00:29:11.609

is we believe where the practice of
 

00:29:11.619 --> 00:29:17.229
is we believe where the practice of
having sort of extreme games jumping on

00:29:17.229 --> 00:29:17.239
having sort of extreme games jumping on
 

00:29:17.239 --> 00:29:22.720
having sort of extreme games jumping on
and off of horned cattle began but we

00:29:22.720 --> 00:29:22.730
and off of horned cattle began but we
 

00:29:22.730 --> 00:29:24.820
and off of horned cattle began but we
don't know and the bones make it clear

00:29:24.820 --> 00:29:24.830
don't know and the bones make it clear
 

00:29:24.830 --> 00:29:27.039
don't know and the bones make it clear
that that's very early in the period of

00:29:27.039 --> 00:29:27.049
that that's very early in the period of
 

00:29:27.049 --> 00:29:28.029
that that's very early in the period of

central Turkey and northwest Sudan circa
 

00:29:35.359 --> 00:29:40.119
central Turkey and northwest Sudan circa
7000 BC so you have the likelihood that

7000 BC so you have the likelihood that
 

00:29:40.129 --> 00:29:42.940
7000 BC so you have the likelihood that
you have two different domestication

that is extremely awkward about most
theories of domestication that they

00:31:24.370 --> 00:31:24.380
theories of domestication that they
 

00:31:24.380 --> 00:31:28.990
theories of domestication that they
assume that that certain animals are

00:31:28.990 --> 00:31:29.000
assume that that certain animals are
 

00:31:29.000 --> 00:31:32.620
assume that that certain animals are

susceptible of domestication and others
 

00:31:32.630 --> 00:31:35.890
susceptible of domestication and others
are not and that humans early on

are not and that humans early on

discovered which subsets could be used
 

00:31:38.690 --> 00:31:41.680
discovered which subsets could be used
and that sort of made domestication a

00:31:41.680 --> 00:31:41.690
and that sort of made domestication a
 

00:31:41.690 --> 00:31:47.110
and that sort of made domestication a

millennia BC this is Jared Diamond's
 

00:31:50.350 --> 00:31:52.750
millennia BC this is Jared Diamond's
proposal but he's picking it up from a

00:31:52.750 --> 00:31:52.760
proposal but he's picking it up from a
 

00:31:52.760 --> 00:31:55.660
proposal but he's picking it up from a
number of other people what this

00:31:55.660 --> 00:31:55.670
number of other people what this
 

00:31:55.670 --> 00:31:58.240
number of other people what this
indicates is that you had a local wild

00:31:58.240 --> 00:31:58.250
indicates is that you had a local wild
 

00:31:58.250 --> 00:32:02.370
indicates is that you had a local wild
animal that was being penned up for

00:32:02.370 --> 00:32:02.380
animal that was being penned up for
 

00:32:02.380 --> 00:32:04.390
animal that was being penned up for
protracted periods of time or else you

00:32:04.390 --> 00:32:04.400
protracted periods of time or else you
 

00:32:04.400 --> 00:32:05.350
protracted periods of time or else you
wouldn't have gotten the degree of

wouldn't have gotten the degree of
accumulation of dung you have an animal

00:32:07.960 --> 00:32:07.970
accumulation of dung you have an animal
 

00:32:07.970 --> 00:32:11.140
accumulation of dung you have an animal
that we see in images as having some

00:32:11.140 --> 00:32:11.150
that we see in images as having some
 

00:32:11.150 --> 00:32:17.590
that we see in images as having some
sort of ritual attraction but it never

00:32:17.590 --> 00:32:17.600
sort of ritual attraction but it never
 

00:32:17.600 --> 00:32:21.010
sort of ritual attraction but it never
becomes domestic so then you have this

00:32:21.010 --> 00:32:21.020
becomes domestic so then you have this
 

00:32:21.020 --> 00:32:24.310
becomes domestic so then you have this
question of is there something about the

00:32:24.310 --> 00:32:24.320
question of is there something about the
 

00:32:24.320 --> 00:32:26.740
question of is there something about the
indigenous populations of the Sahara

00:32:26.740 --> 00:32:26.750
indigenous populations of the Sahara
 

00:32:26.750 --> 00:32:30.580
indigenous populations of the Sahara

animals that is fundamentally different
from the relationship of animals that

00:32:36.850 --> 00:32:36.860
from the relationship of animals that
 

00:32:36.860 --> 00:32:40.330
from the relationship of animals that
you find in the grain growing Middle

you find in the grain growing Middle
East where you have sheep and goats and

East where you have sheep and goats and
 

00:32:43.460 --> 00:32:46.390
East where you have sheep and goats and
cattle cattle in a somewhat different

cattle cattle in a somewhat different
formation and different from what you

00:32:48.970 --> 00:32:48.980
formation and different from what you
 

00:32:48.980 --> 00:32:50.830

camels and farther north reindeer if so
 

00:33:01.330 --> 00:33:03.130
camels and farther north reindeer if so
then there's a question is whether

00:33:03.130 --> 00:33:03.140
then there's a question is whether
 

00:33:03.140 --> 00:33:06.480
then there's a question is whether
African history should start with Egypt

00:33:06.480 --> 00:33:06.490
African history should start with Egypt
 

00:33:06.490 --> 00:33:10.330
African history should start with Egypt
which is the extension into Africa of

00:33:10.330 --> 00:33:10.340
which is the extension into Africa of
 

00:33:10.340 --> 00:33:14.350
which is the extension into Africa of
the Middle Eastern complex or whether it

00:33:14.350 --> 00:33:14.360
the Middle Eastern complex or whether it
 

00:33:14.360 --> 00:33:17.250
the Middle Eastern complex or whether it
should be following the history of this

should be following the history of this
 

00:33:17.260 --> 00:33:22.420
should be following the history of this
indigenous African pattern and if you

00:33:22.420 --> 00:33:22.430
indigenous African pattern and if you
 

00:33:22.430 --> 00:33:25.780
indigenous African pattern and if you
think in those terms then you say well

00:33:25.780 --> 00:33:25.790
think in those terms then you say well
 

00:33:25.790 --> 00:33:29.049
think in those terms then you say well
what happens to this cattle culture

00:33:29.049 --> 00:33:29.059
what happens to this cattle culture

00:50:47.560 --> 00:50:47.570
grain and I think that that would be of
 

00:50:47.570 --> 00:50:50.920

right so that's what I wanted to talk

00:51:22.360 --> 00:51:22.370
right so that's what I wanted to talk

completely different subject but it goes
 

00:51:33.770 --> 00:51:35.140

back to something I have talked about
 

00:51:35.150 --> 00:51:36.970
back to something I have talked about

of course using the wind is not late if

of course using the wind is not late if

the question of you know what is a sail

00:54:28.229 --> 00:54:28.239
the question of you know what is a sail
 

00:54:28.239 --> 00:54:32.960
the question of you know what is a sail
made of say old sails made out of cloth

00:54:32.960 --> 00:54:32.970
made of say old sails made out of cloth
 

00:54:32.970 --> 00:54:35.400
made of say old sails made out of cloth
yeah well what about you don't have

00:54:35.400 --> 00:54:35.410
yeah well what about you don't have
 

00:54:35.410 --> 00:54:41.519
yeah well what about you don't have
cloth or what if your loom produces a

00:54:41.519 --> 00:54:41.529
cloth or what if your loom produces a
 

00:54:41.529 --> 00:54:44.819
cloth or what if your loom produces a
cloth that is 2 inches wide and 2 feet

00:54:44.819 --> 00:54:44.829
cloth that is 2 inches wide and 2 feet
 

00:54:44.829 --> 00:54:47.609

long and you're going to sew together

00:54:47.609 --> 00:54:47.619
long and you're going to sew together
 

00:54:47.619 --> 00:54:51.599
long and you're going to sew together
all those so it's more likely it seems

00:54:51.599 --> 00:54:51.609
all those so it's more likely it seems
 

00:54:51.609 --> 00:54:54.830
all those so it's more likely it seems
that sails originally were made on a mat

00:54:54.830 --> 00:54:54.840
that sails originally were made on a mat
 

00:54:54.840 --> 00:55:00.510

something like that that could be turned

00:55:10.200 --> 00:55:10.210
something like that that could be turned
 

00:55:10.210 --> 00:55:11.840
something like that that could be turned
into strips and then woven together

00:55:11.840 --> 00:55:11.850
into strips and then woven together
 

00:55:11.850 --> 00:55:15.930
into strips and then woven together
would be a plausible place where you'd

00:55:15.930 --> 00:55:15.940
would be a plausible place where you'd
 

00:55:15.940 --> 00:55:18.210
would be a plausible place where you'd
have sails and then of course ties

00:55:18.210 --> 00:55:18.220
have sails and then of course ties
 

00:55:18.220 --> 00:55:21.530

sailing into the history of basketry
 

00:55:21.540 --> 00:55:24.000
sailing into the history of basketry
history of basketry is not very well

00:55:24.000 --> 00:55:24.010
history of basketry is not very well
 

00:55:24.010 --> 00:55:25.680
history of basketry is not very well

originally because it doesn't leave much
in the way of remains but there is a

in the way of remains but there is a
 

00:55:28.110 --> 00:55:31.620
in the way of remains but there is a
argument that I think is not an oblong

00:55:31.620 --> 00:55:31.630
argument that I think is not an oblong
 

00:55:31.630 --> 00:55:34.950

sound one that that pottery may begin

00:55:34.950 --> 00:55:34.960
sound one that that pottery may begin
 

00:55:34.960 --> 00:55:40.860
sound one that that pottery may begin
with basketry yeah the problem with the

00:55:40.860 --> 00:55:40.870
with basketry yeah the problem with the
 

00:55:40.870 --> 00:55:43.890
with basketry yeah the problem with the
basket is that if you put it on a fire

00:55:43.890 --> 00:55:43.900
basket is that if you put it on a fire
 

00:55:43.900 --> 00:55:46.830
basket is that if you put it on a fire
it burns up but that's that's pretty

00:55:46.830 --> 00:55:46.840
it burns up but that's that's pretty
 

00:55:46.840 --> 00:55:50.640
it burns up but that's that's pretty
obvious so and yet you want to cook

00:55:50.640 --> 00:55:50.650
obvious so and yet you want to cook
 

00:55:50.650 --> 00:55:54.600
obvious so and yet you want to cook
something because chewing up you know

00:55:54.600 --> 00:55:54.610
something because chewing up you know
 

00:55:54.610 --> 00:55:58.170
something because chewing up you know

raw wheat grains grinds your teeth down
 

00:55:58.180 --> 00:56:02.640
raw wheat grains grinds your teeth down
and dental care was poor so you want to

00:56:02.640 --> 00:56:02.650
and dental care was poor so you want to
 

00:56:02.650 --> 00:56:03.720
and dental care was poor so you want to
cook it you'd want to make this stuff

00:56:03.720 --> 00:56:03.730
cook it you'd want to make this stuff
 

00:56:03.730 --> 00:56:07.140
cook it you'd want to make this stuff
soft so how do you do it when you don't

00:56:07.140 --> 00:56:07.150
soft so how do you do it when you don't
 

00:56:07.150 --> 00:56:09.080
soft so how do you do it when you don't
have anything you can put on the fire

00:56:09.080 --> 00:56:09.090
have anything you can put on the fire
 

00:56:09.090 --> 00:56:14.220
have anything you can put on the fire
the idea was that you take a basket you

00:56:14.220 --> 00:56:14.230
the idea was that you take a basket you
 

00:56:14.230 --> 00:56:16.350
the idea was that you take a basket you
line the basket with something that will

00:56:16.350 --> 00:56:16.360
line the basket with something that will
 

00:56:16.360 --> 00:56:19.830
line the basket with something that will
be that will make it watertight like

00:56:19.830 --> 00:56:19.840
be that will make it watertight like
 

00:56:19.840 --> 00:56:24.360
be that will make it watertight like
clay and then you put in water and you

00:56:24.360 --> 00:56:24.370
clay and then you put in water and you
 

00:56:24.370 --> 00:56:28.890
clay and then you put in water and you
know some barley so wild onions maybe a

00:56:28.890 --> 00:56:28.900
know some barley so wild onions maybe a
 

00:56:28.900 --> 00:56:32.060
know some barley so wild onions maybe a
little tarragon or mant or something and

00:56:32.060 --> 00:56:32.070
little tarragon or mant or something and
 

00:56:32.070 --> 00:56:36.090
little tarragon or mant or something and
you take really really hot stones from

00:56:36.090 --> 00:56:36.100
you take really really hot stones from
 

00:56:36.100 --> 00:56:38.010
you take really really hot stones from
the fire and you drop them in to the

00:56:38.010 --> 00:56:38.020
the fire and you drop them in to the
 

00:56:38.020 --> 00:56:41.820
the fire and you drop them in to the
water and so you boil the stuff from the

00:56:41.820 --> 00:56:41.830
water and so you boil the stuff from the
 

00:56:41.830 --> 00:56:44.040
water and so you boil the stuff from the
inside out instead of putting it on the

00:56:44.040 --> 00:56:44.050
inside out instead of putting it on the
 

00:56:44.050 --> 00:56:46.110
inside out instead of putting it on the
fire because you can't put in the fire

00:56:46.110 --> 00:56:46.120
fire because you can't put in the fire
 

00:56:46.120 --> 00:56:49.230
fire because you can't put in the fire
you burn up the basket and the idea that

00:56:49.230 --> 00:56:49.240
you burn up the basket and the idea that
 

00:56:49.240 --> 00:56:51.920
you burn up the basket and the idea that
arise from that is supposing you

00:56:51.920 --> 00:56:51.930
arise from that is supposing you
 

00:56:51.930 --> 00:56:54.180
arise from that is supposing you
particularly after you discover that

00:56:54.180 --> 00:56:54.190
particularly after you discover that
 

00:56:54.190 --> 00:56:56.880
particularly after you discover that
that those hot stones make the clay

00:56:56.880 --> 00:56:56.890
that those hot stones make the clay
 

00:56:56.890 --> 00:57:00.060
that those hot stones make the clay
inside the basket real hard then you

00:57:00.060 --> 00:57:00.070
inside the basket real hard then you
 

00:57:00.070 --> 00:57:01.830
inside the basket real hard then you
think well why don't we take away the

00:57:01.830 --> 00:57:01.840
think well why don't we take away the
 

00:57:01.840 --> 00:57:03.750
think well why don't we take away the
basket and simply use the real hard clay

00:57:03.750 --> 00:57:03.760
basket and simply use the real hard clay
 

00:57:03.760 --> 00:57:06.120
basket and simply use the real hard clay
and then we have something that we can

00:57:06.120 --> 00:57:06.130
and then we have something that we can
 

00:57:06.130 --> 00:57:07.140
and then we have something that we can
put on the fire

00:57:07.140 --> 00:57:07.150
put on the fire
 

00:57:07.150 --> 00:57:10.410
put on the fire
that's one possibility but the thing is

00:57:10.410 --> 00:57:10.420
that's one possibility but the thing is
 

00:57:10.420 --> 00:57:12.900
that's one possibility but the thing is
that plating things appears to be

00:57:12.900 --> 00:57:12.910
that plating things appears to be
 

00:57:12.910 --> 00:57:17.460
that plating things appears to be
extremely old it doesn't depend on on

00:57:17.460 --> 00:57:17.470
extremely old it doesn't depend on on
 

00:57:17.470 --> 00:57:21.270
extremely old it doesn't depend on on
growing any particular plant or having

growing any particular plant or having
 

00:57:21.280 --> 00:57:26.250
growing any particular plant or having
any particular tool it's just a way of

and they would have a square sail
 

00:57:46.050 --> 00:57:51.570
and they would have a square sail
typically wider than it is tall and they

typically wider than it is tall and they
 

00:57:51.580 --> 00:57:55.020
typically wider than it is tall and they
would have a yard at the top in the yard

would have a yard at the top in the yard
 

00:57:55.030 --> 00:58:00.990
would have a yard at the top in the yard
at the bottom and they would use it on

at the bottom and they would use it on
 

00:58:01.000 --> 00:58:07.020

this was the type of sail they used

00:58:19.370 --> 00:58:19.380
this was the type of sail they used
 

00:58:19.380 --> 00:58:24.030
this was the type of sail they used
after which they got rid of this yard on

00:58:24.030 --> 00:58:24.040
after which they got rid of this yard on

hung down and they could tie up tie it
 

00:58:34.810 --> 00:58:37.800

vessel so this is a square sail

00:58:41.130 --> 00:58:41.140
vessel so this is a square sail
 

00:58:41.140 --> 00:58:46.700
vessel so this is a square sail
tradition the squares tale tradition is

00:58:46.700 --> 00:58:46.710
tradition the squares tale tradition is
 

00:58:46.710 --> 00:58:50.760
tradition the squares tale tradition is
one of the important traditions and

00:58:50.760 --> 00:58:50.770
one of the important traditions and
 

00:58:50.770 --> 00:58:54.090
one of the important traditions and
sailing but it has very little to do

00:58:54.090 --> 00:58:54.100
sailing but it has very little to do
 

00:58:54.100 --> 00:58:58.890
sailing but it has very little to do
with most of the world sails the the

00:58:58.890 --> 00:58:58.900
with most of the world sails the the
 

00:58:58.900 --> 00:59:02.070
with most of the world sails the the
sails that you get in the Indian Ocean

00:59:02.070 --> 00:59:02.080
sails that you get in the Indian Ocean
 

00:59:02.080 --> 00:59:05.370
sails that you get in the Indian Ocean
and eastward seem to come from a

00:59:05.370 --> 00:59:05.380
and eastward seem to come from a
 

00:59:05.380 --> 00:59:08.940
and eastward seem to come from a
different concept and this was the idea

00:59:08.940 --> 00:59:08.950
different concept and this was the idea
 

00:59:08.950 --> 00:59:11.880
different concept and this was the idea
that

00:59:11.880 --> 00:59:11.890
 
 

00:59:11.890 --> 00:59:14.400
 
you would have a vessel and you had two

00:59:14.400 --> 00:59:14.410
you would have a vessel and you had two
 

00:59:14.410 --> 00:59:21.299
you would have a vessel and you had two
sticks like that and you would tie of a

00:59:21.299 --> 00:59:21.309
sticks like that and you would tie of a
 

00:59:21.309 --> 00:59:23.309
sticks like that and you would tie of a
square of matting you tie it across here

00:59:23.309 --> 00:59:23.319
square of matting you tie it across here
 

00:59:23.319 --> 00:59:27.180
square of matting you tie it across here
would hang down and then you would tie

00:59:27.180 --> 00:59:27.190
would hang down and then you would tie
 

00:59:27.190 --> 00:59:30.299
would hang down and then you would tie
one end to the front one in the back so

00:59:30.299 --> 00:59:30.309
one end to the front one in the back so
 

00:59:30.309 --> 00:59:36.089
one end to the front one in the back so
it was a a fore-and-aft sail with two

00:59:36.089 --> 00:59:36.099
it was a a fore-and-aft sail with two
 

00:59:36.099 --> 00:59:38.519
it was a a fore-and-aft sail with two
rather slender sticks that are called

00:59:38.519 --> 00:59:38.529
rather slender sticks that are called
 

00:59:38.529 --> 00:59:44.750
rather slender sticks that are called
spritz those is called a a double sprit

00:59:44.750 --> 00:59:44.760
spritz those is called a a double sprit
 

00:59:44.760 --> 00:59:53.960
spritz those is called a a double sprit
tight sail it is light it is

00:59:53.960 --> 00:59:53.970
 
 

00:59:53.970 --> 00:59:58.769
 
comparatively easy to make in its most

00:59:58.769 --> 00:59:58.779
comparatively easy to make in its most
 

00:59:58.779 --> 01:00:03.000
comparatively easy to make in its most
primitive form it can be found in

01:00:03.000 --> 01:00:03.010
primitive form it can be found in
 

01:00:03.010 --> 01:00:04.940
primitive form it can be found in
several places around the Indian Ocean

01:00:04.940 --> 01:00:04.950
several places around the Indian Ocean
 

01:00:04.950 --> 01:00:09.359
several places around the Indian Ocean
most notably because of the geographical

01:00:09.359 --> 01:00:09.369
most notably because of the geographical
 

01:00:09.369 --> 01:00:11.880
most notably because of the geographical
features on the island of Madagascar on

01:00:11.880 --> 01:00:11.890
features on the island of Madagascar on
 

01:00:11.890 --> 01:00:14.779
features on the island of Madagascar on
the western side of the Indian Ocean and

01:00:14.779 --> 01:00:14.789
the western side of the Indian Ocean and
 

01:00:14.789 --> 01:00:18.059
the western side of the Indian Ocean and
yet every indication is that it

01:00:18.059 --> 01:00:18.069
yet every indication is that it
 

01:00:18.069 --> 01:00:20.910
yet every indication is that it
originated in Indonesia on the eastern

01:00:20.910 --> 01:00:20.920
originated in Indonesia on the eastern
 

01:00:20.920 --> 01:00:22.950
originated in Indonesia on the eastern
side of the Indian Ocean so in other

01:00:22.950 --> 01:00:22.960
side of the Indian Ocean so in other
 

01:00:22.960 --> 01:00:24.779
side of the Indian Ocean so in other
words this appears to be a sail that

01:00:24.779 --> 01:00:24.789
words this appears to be a sail that
 

01:00:24.789 --> 01:00:27.960
words this appears to be a sail that
didn't go up and down the Nile River but

01:00:27.960 --> 01:00:27.970
didn't go up and down the Nile River but
 

01:00:27.970 --> 01:00:29.789
didn't go up and down the Nile River but
rather went all the way across the

01:00:29.789 --> 01:00:29.799
rather went all the way across the
 

01:00:29.799 --> 01:00:32.910
rather went all the way across the
Indian Ocean leaving traces here and

01:00:32.910 --> 01:00:32.920
Indian Ocean leaving traces here and
 

01:00:32.920 --> 01:00:38.009
Indian Ocean leaving traces here and
there that gets into the question of

01:00:38.009 --> 01:00:38.019
there that gets into the question of
 

01:00:38.019 --> 01:00:41.970
there that gets into the question of
dating because the island of Madagascar

01:00:41.970 --> 01:00:41.980
dating because the island of Madagascar
 

01:00:41.980 --> 01:00:47.329
dating because the island of Madagascar
which is now the Malagasy Republic and

01:00:47.329 --> 01:00:47.339
 
 

01:00:47.339 --> 01:00:52.170
 
speaks a language known as Malagasy that

01:00:52.170 --> 01:00:52.180
speaks a language known as Malagasy that
 

01:00:52.180 --> 01:00:56.309
speaks a language known as Malagasy that
language is an Indonesian language even

01:00:56.309 --> 01:00:56.319
language is an Indonesian language even
 

01:00:56.319 --> 01:00:58.410
language is an Indonesian language even
though the island is located very near

01:00:58.410 --> 01:00:58.420
though the island is located very near
 

01:00:58.420 --> 01:01:01.349
though the island is located very near
the east coast of Africa current

01:01:01.349 --> 01:01:01.359
the east coast of Africa current
 

01:01:01.359 --> 01:01:02.519
the east coast of Africa current
thinking is that the island was

01:01:02.519 --> 01:01:02.529
thinking is that the island was
 

01:01:02.529 --> 01:01:06.029
thinking is that the island was
uninhabited before people from Indonesia

01:01:06.029 --> 01:01:06.039
uninhabited before people from Indonesia
 

01:01:06.039 --> 01:01:08.400
uninhabited before people from Indonesia
got there that is to say that the

01:01:08.400 --> 01:01:08.410
got there that is to say that the
 

01:01:08.410 --> 01:01:10.710
got there that is to say that the
sailing vessels that brought them were

01:01:10.710 --> 01:01:10.720
sailing vessels that brought them were
 

01:01:10.720 --> 01:01:13.620
sailing vessels that brought them were
the first sailing vessels that were

01:01:13.620 --> 01:01:13.630
the first sailing vessels that were
 

01:01:13.630 --> 01:01:18.450
the first sailing vessels that were
available to people living in Eastern

01:01:18.450 --> 01:01:18.460
available to people living in Eastern
 

01:01:18.460 --> 01:01:22.130
available to people living in Eastern
Africa there is a guess that the

01:01:22.130 --> 01:01:22.140
Africa there is a guess that the
 

01:01:22.140 --> 01:01:24.420
Africa there is a guess that the
Indonesians probably settled on the

01:01:24.420 --> 01:01:24.430
Indonesians probably settled on the
 

01:01:24.430 --> 01:01:24.910
Indonesians probably settled on the
African

population and were eventually absorbed

01:01:33.070 --> 01:01:33.080
population and were eventually absorbed
 

01:01:33.080 --> 01:01:37.360
population and were eventually absorbed
by the indigenous peoples of the African

by the indigenous peoples of the African
 

01:01:37.370 --> 01:01:39.370
by the indigenous peoples of the African
continent but that on the island of

01:01:39.370 --> 01:01:39.380
continent but that on the island of
 

01:01:39.380 --> 01:01:41.860

Madagascar they were on their own and

when did this happen there is a guest

01:01:47.890 --> 01:01:47.900
when did this happen there is a guest

we're in Indonesia until the Indians
began coming and then they left although

bad drawings to show you how it evolves
 

01:04:49.910 --> 01:04:52.059
bad drawings to show you how it evolves
because there's a it's an interesting

01:04:52.059 --> 01:04:52.069
because there's a it's an interesting
 

01:04:52.069 --> 01:04:55.390
because there's a it's an interesting
evolution where you you know you can

01:04:55.390 --> 01:04:55.400

have your spritz like this and then the

01:04:57.160 --> 01:04:57.170
have your spritz like this and then the
 

01:04:57.170 --> 01:04:59.380
have your spritz like this and then the
setting the square sail so let's just

01:04:59.380 --> 01:04:59.390
setting the square sail so let's just
 

01:04:59.390 --> 01:05:00.970
setting the square sail so let's just
have the sail be triangular and have it

01:05:00.970 --> 01:05:00.980
have the sail be triangular and have it
 

01:05:00.980 --> 01:05:07.450
have the sail be triangular and have it
fit between the spritz and now this is a

01:05:07.450 --> 01:05:07.460
fit between the spritz and now this is a
 

01:05:07.460 --> 01:05:09.730
fit between the spritz and now this is a
problem because it means that the

01:05:09.730 --> 01:05:09.740
problem because it means that the
 

01:05:09.740 --> 01:05:13.059
problem because it means that the
fullest force of the wind is up here and

01:05:13.059 --> 01:05:13.069
fullest force of the wind is up here and
 

01:05:13.069 --> 01:05:16.059
fullest force of the wind is up here and
you're down here so your boat is tippy

01:05:16.059 --> 01:05:16.069
you're down here so your boat is tippy
 

01:05:16.069 --> 01:05:21.120
you're down here so your boat is tippy
so then then they say well supposing we

01:05:21.120 --> 01:05:21.130
so then then they say well supposing we
 

01:05:21.130 --> 01:05:24.730
so then then they say well supposing we
tipped it so we have the spritz like

01:05:24.730 --> 01:05:24.740
tipped it so we have the spritz like
 

01:05:24.740 --> 01:05:30.099
tipped it so we have the spritz like
this with a triangular sail and that way

01:05:30.099 --> 01:05:30.109
this with a triangular sail and that way
 

01:05:30.109 --> 01:05:34.270
this with a triangular sail and that way
we lower the the center of force come

01:05:34.270 --> 01:05:34.280
we lower the the center of force come
 

01:05:34.280 --> 01:05:37.750
we lower the the center of force come
from the wind and that was okay except

01:05:37.750 --> 01:05:37.760
from the wind and that was okay except
 

01:05:37.760 --> 01:05:40.059
from the wind and that was okay except
how do you keep these spritz in this

01:05:40.059 --> 01:05:40.069
how do you keep these spritz in this
 

01:05:40.069 --> 01:05:42.700
how do you keep these spritz in this
position so then they have the idea well

01:05:42.700 --> 01:05:42.710
position so then they have the idea well
 

01:05:42.710 --> 01:05:47.349
position so then they have the idea well
let's let's really flatten it out and

01:05:47.349 --> 01:05:47.359
 
 

01:05:47.359 --> 01:05:50.959
 
make it like that and that put a kind of

01:05:50.959 --> 01:05:50.969
make it like that and that put a kind of
 

01:05:50.969 --> 01:05:54.819
make it like that and that put a kind of
a post in here with a cup device on it

01:05:54.819 --> 01:05:54.829
a post in here with a cup device on it
 

01:05:54.829 --> 01:05:59.839

to hold the sprit in place and that

01:05:59.839 --> 01:05:59.849
to hold the sprit in place and that
 

01:05:59.849 --> 01:06:05.659
to hold the sprit in place and that
becomes the mast these spritz are not

01:06:05.659 --> 01:06:05.669
becomes the mast these spritz are not
 

01:06:05.669 --> 01:06:10.999
becomes the mast these spritz are not
considered masts they're too light and

01:06:10.999 --> 01:06:11.009
considered masts they're too light and
 

01:06:11.009 --> 01:06:14.839
considered masts they're too light and
flexible to really qualify as mass so

01:06:14.839 --> 01:06:14.849
flexible to really qualify as mass so
 

01:06:14.849 --> 01:06:19.489
flexible to really qualify as mass so
now you're getting a design that's very

01:06:19.489 --> 01:06:19.499
now you're getting a design that's very
 

01:06:19.499 --> 01:06:22.339
now you're getting a design that's very
similar to the lateen sail of the later

and New Zealand you can find relations
between the sails that you can trace

know there are maps that sort of give

01:07:35.659 --> 01:07:35.669
know there are maps that sort of give
 

01:07:35.669 --> 01:07:38.029

you the details about this but the point

01:07:38.029 --> 01:07:38.039
you the details about this but the point
 

01:07:38.039 --> 01:07:40.929
you the details about this but the point
is that the the sprit sails

01:07:40.929 --> 01:07:40.939
is that the the sprit sails
 

01:07:40.939 --> 01:07:47.509
is that the the sprit sails
were really effective for ocean ocean

01:07:47.509 --> 01:07:47.519
were really effective for ocean ocean
 

01:07:47.519 --> 01:07:50.689
were really effective for ocean ocean

was the use of outriggers you can have

01:07:57.589 --> 01:07:57.599
was the use of outriggers you can have

craft once you put up a sail you have
 

01:08:32.000 --> 01:08:35.740
craft once you put up a sail you have
something of a problem because the sail

01:08:35.740 --> 01:08:35.750
something of a problem because the sail
 

01:08:35.750 --> 01:08:42.490
something of a problem because the sail
causes the boat to to to to keel over as

using a square sail now the thinking is
that South America may have been

01:11:00.130 --> 01:11:00.140
that South America may have been

our speculations more than things that
can be firmly pinned down but what is

01:11:30.230 --> 01:11:30.240
can be firmly pinned down but what is
 

01:11:30.240 --> 01:11:33.590
can be firmly pinned down but what is
certainly known is that virtually every

01:11:33.590 --> 01:11:33.600
certainly known is that virtually every
 

01:11:33.600 --> 01:11:37.040
certainly known is that virtually every
point in the Pacific was reached using

01:11:37.040 --> 01:11:37.050

for example in Hawaii it was known that

01:12:00.020 --> 01:12:00.030
for example in Hawaii it was known that
 

01:12:00.030 --> 01:12:02.810
for example in Hawaii it was known that
there must be land somewhere to the east

01:12:02.810 --> 01:12:02.820
there must be land somewhere to the east
 

01:12:02.820 --> 01:12:05.390
there must be land somewhere to the east
of Hawaii because there were land birds

01:12:05.390 --> 01:12:05.400
of Hawaii because there were land birds
 

01:12:05.400 --> 01:12:07.549
of Hawaii because there were land birds
that were flying in from the east as

01:12:07.549 --> 01:12:07.559
that were flying in from the east as
 

01:12:07.559 --> 01:12:10.600
that were flying in from the east as
they migrated and landing in Hawaii and

01:12:10.600 --> 01:12:10.610
they migrated and landing in Hawaii and
 

01:12:10.610 --> 01:12:13.399
they migrated and landing in Hawaii and
so people in Hawaii could have said well

01:12:13.399 --> 01:12:13.409
so people in Hawaii could have said well
 

01:12:13.409 --> 01:12:17.739
so people in Hawaii could have said well
there must be something over there I

01:12:17.749 --> 01:12:20.359
 
don't know of any North American birds

don't know of any North American birds
 

01:12:20.369 --> 01:12:23.000
don't know of any North American birds
that you know show up in Spain when they

we've had a very hard time recovering in

we've had a very hard time recovering in
 

01:12:34.679 --> 01:12:38.719
we've had a very hard time recovering in
our narrative forms is a saga of the

our narrative forms is a saga of the
 

01:12:38.729 --> 01:12:42.160
our narrative forms is a saga of the
peopling of the of the Pacific Ocean and

peopling of the of the Pacific Ocean and
 

01:12:42.170 --> 01:12:47.779
peopling of the of the Pacific Ocean and
of Island Southeast Asia and this is one

01:12:47.779 --> 01:12:47.789
of Island Southeast Asia and this is one
 

01:12:47.789 --> 01:12:49.790
of Island Southeast Asia and this is one
