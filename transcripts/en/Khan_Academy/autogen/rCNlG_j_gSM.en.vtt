00:00:00.282 --> 00:00:03.115
 Suppose there are a handful of water 

00:00:03.115 --> 00:00:06.621
 Separated by a semi-permeable membrane 

00:00:06.621 --> 00:00:09.570
 But what does a semi-permeable membrane mean? 

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:11.079
 This means that some things are allowed to pass 

00:00:11.079 --> 00:00:13.192
 And prevents the passage of other things 

00:00:13.192 --> 00:00:15.468
 That is, this membrane resembles an outlet 

00:00:15.468 --> 00:00:18.254
 Allow water molecules to pass 

00:00:18.254 --> 00:00:20.437
 We will talk later about what is not allowed 

00:00:20.437 --> 00:00:22.991
 Which makes it semi-outlet 

00:00:22.991 --> 00:00:24.755
 Think about what can happen if it is 

00:00:24.755 --> 00:00:26.910
 Water molecules are present on both sides 

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:29.696
 We talked about this in video-related videos 

00:00:29.696 --> 00:00:32.041
 Since the concentration of water molecules is equal 

00:00:32.041 --> 00:00:35.060
 On both sides, the probability of transmission is one 

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:38.844
 Of these molecules to this aspect in a specific time period 

00:00:38.844 --> 00:00:41.608
 Is equal to the probability of another water molecule moving 

00:00:41.608 --> 00:00:45.044
 From right to left in the same time period 

00:00:45.044 --> 00:00:46.925
 This is due to the same emphasis 

00:00:46.925 --> 00:00:48.968
 These things move 

00:00:48.968 --> 00:00:53.171
 In different directions 

00:00:53.171 --> 00:00:55.260
 At different speeds 

00:00:57.675 --> 00:00:59.300
 We talked about probability 

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:01.019
 We said that the probability of moving from left to right 

00:01:01.019 --> 00:01:03.155
 Through one of these gaps, is equal 

00:01:03.155 --> 00:01:04.966
 The probability of moving from right to left 

00:01:04.966 --> 00:01:07.172
 In a specified time period 

00:01:07.172 --> 00:01:09.540
 But to make it interesting 

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:12.257
 We treat water as solvent 

00:01:12.257 --> 00:01:14.741
 And we shall put the soliloquy therein 

00:01:14.741 --> 00:01:17.249
 To melt 

00:01:17.249 --> 00:01:20.221
 Let's put some of the solute particles here 

00:01:20.221 --> 00:01:23.087
 We make it larger in size to see clearly 

00:01:23.087 --> 00:01:26.118
 They will find it difficult to pass through these gaps 

00:01:26.118 --> 00:01:28.022
 There are other cases where similar permeable membranes are used 

00:01:28.022 --> 00:01:30.251
 The charge to allow some things to pass 

00:01:30.251 --> 00:01:31.714
 Preventing others 

00:01:31.714 --> 00:01:35.824
 But easy to imagine size 

00:01:35.824 --> 00:01:37.217
 Think of the membrane as allowing only 

00:01:37.217 --> 00:01:39.748
 The passage of specific objects of specific sizes 

00:01:39.748 --> 00:01:42.139
 Let us put some of the melancholy here 

00:01:42.139 --> 00:01:44.322
 this too 

00:01:44.322 --> 00:01:49.453
 On the other hand, we place a particle or a particle on it 

00:01:49.453 --> 00:01:51.265
 In fact let's increase the number of particles 

00:01:51.265 --> 00:01:55.374
 In the right side 

00:01:55.374 --> 00:01:56.953
 So that the dissolved concentration 

00:01:56.953 --> 00:02:00.018
 Top in this aspect 

00:02:00.018 --> 00:02:01.922
 This is a semi-permeable membrane 

00:02:01.922 --> 00:02:04.546
 Clearly, the size of these gaps 

00:02:04.546 --> 00:02:06.589
 These large particles will not be allowed to pass 

00:02:06.589 --> 00:02:08.191
 Across the membrane 

00:02:08.191 --> 00:02:09.269
 And therefore will not be able to spread 

00:02:09.269 --> 00:02:10.420
 But if allowed to spread 

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:12.626
 These particles move toward the concentration gradients, from the higher concentration to the low concentration 

00:02:12.626 --> 00:02:14.994
 These large particles are likely to be transported 

00:02:17.014 --> 00:02:19.185
 From right to left is greater than the possibility of moving from left to right at any time 

00:02:19.185 --> 00:02:21.135
 Because the number of particles is larger on the right side 

00:02:21.135 --> 00:02:23.407
 But this membrane 

00:02:23.407 --> 00:02:24.804
 Semi-outlet 

00:02:24.804 --> 00:02:25.894
 Thus will not be allowed 

00:02:25.894 --> 00:02:28.008
 The spread of these things 

00:02:28.008 --> 00:02:29.749
 All these have large particles 

00:02:29.749 --> 00:02:35.275
 Its own speed 

00:02:38.387 --> 00:02:41.103
 So, what will happen? 

00:02:41.103 --> 00:02:42.682
 Let's think about it 

00:02:42.682 --> 00:02:44.192
 Large particles can not 

00:02:44.192 --> 00:02:45.515
 Spread from side to side 

00:02:45.515 --> 00:02:47.674
 But what happens to water molecules? 

00:02:47.674 --> 00:02:50.275
 The water molecules will not stop, on the left side 

00:02:50.275 --> 00:02:52.075
 About the movement 

00:02:52.075 --> 00:02:53.409
 If it moves to the right side 

00:02:53.409 --> 00:02:55.453
 It can move from the left side to the right 

00:02:55.453 --> 00:02:58.587
 And moves to the right side through these gaps 

00:02:58.587 --> 00:03:01.234
 But what about the molecules on the right side? 

00:03:01.234 --> 00:03:04.462
 If appropriate conditions exist 

00:03:05.971 --> 00:03:08.918
 This molecule may pass through the membrane 

00:03:08.918 --> 00:03:09.895
 And so we get the 

00:03:09.895 --> 00:03:12.356
 Water molecules move back and forth 

00:03:12.356 --> 00:03:14.957
 But we can say that probability 

00:03:14.957 --> 00:03:17.000
 Transmission of water molecules 

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:18.997
 From left to right side, less than 

00:03:18.997 --> 00:03:21.388
 The possibility of moving from the left side to the right 

00:03:21.388 --> 00:03:22.712
 What is the reason? 

00:03:22.712 --> 00:03:24.802
 These large molecules are unable to propagate 

00:03:24.802 --> 00:03:27.565
 Intervene in this matter 

00:03:27.565 --> 00:03:29.213
 They are moving 

00:03:29.213 --> 00:03:30.421
 And sometimes prevented 

00:03:33.819 --> 00:03:39.685
 Access these openings 

00:03:39.685 --> 00:03:42.083
 If this membrane is not present, it will not be inhibited 

00:03:42.083 --> 00:03:44.097
 These molecules process access 

00:03:44.097 --> 00:03:45.443
 But since the membrane exists 

00:03:45.443 --> 00:03:47.626
 The particles may prevent the process from reaching or bouncing 

00:03:47.626 --> 00:03:50.017
 Some water molecules are paid 

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:55.985
 Bound in this direction 

00:03:55.985 --> 00:03:59.200
 Therefore we can say that some water molecules 

00:03:59.212 --> 00:04:01.372
 You succeed in moving from right to left 

00:04:01.372 --> 00:04:03.833
 But the possibility of moving from right to left 

00:04:03.833 --> 00:04:06.364
 Less likely to move from left to right 

00:04:06.364 --> 00:04:09.553
 Thus the water flow is clear from 

00:04:09.553 --> 00:04:13.608
 This is the aspect in which the concentration of the solute decreases 

00:04:13.608 --> 00:04:14.839
 The solvent is the substance 

00:04:14.839 --> 00:04:16.998
 Dissolved in water 

00:04:16.998 --> 00:04:18.623
 The solvent is general 

00:04:18.623 --> 00:04:20.434
 Which is more 

00:04:20.434 --> 00:04:21.526
 In this case water is the solvent 

00:04:21.526 --> 00:04:24.892
 Water is probably the most common solvent 

00:04:24.892 --> 00:04:26.866
 The solubility is less 

00:04:26.866 --> 00:04:29.327
 Accordingly, the solvent dissolves in the solvent 

00:04:29.327 --> 00:04:33.764
 Water molecules migrate clearly 

00:04:33.764 --> 00:04:36.897
 Of this solution in which the solute concentration decreases 

00:04:36.897 --> 00:04:39.567
 To the other, where the concentration of melted is high 

00:04:39.567 --> 00:04:42.725
 This phenomenon is called osmotic property 

00:04:45.627 --> 00:04:47.608
 There are other examples of osmotic properties 

00:04:47.608 --> 00:04:50.433
 This has been observed over and over again 

00:04:50.433 --> 00:04:52.500
 If we put something familiar to fresh water 

00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:56.331
 It has skin or membranes 

00:04:56.331 --> 00:05:00.609
 Allow water to pass, in salt water 

00:05:00.609 --> 00:05:03.674
 Such as a slaughtered animal 

00:05:03.674 --> 00:05:05.804
 It will not do well in the presence of salt 

00:05:05.804 --> 00:05:09.310
 Because the water in the slugs does exactly 

00:05:09.310 --> 00:05:11.748
 What happens in this illustration 

00:05:11.748 --> 00:05:13.513
 We have talked about this mechanism before 

00:05:13.513 --> 00:05:17.182
 The molecules that can not pass through the membrane 

00:05:17.182 --> 00:05:19.712
 And prevents the movement of water molecules from right to left 

00:05:19.712 --> 00:05:21.849
 And continue to bounce, may cause moving water molecules 

00:05:21.849 --> 00:05:24.333
 Located on the left side 

00:05:24.333 --> 00:05:26.516
 To this trend when they bounce back 

00:05:26.516 --> 00:05:27.839
 This is one interpretation 

00:05:27.839 --> 00:05:30.602
 But there is another possibility that is often 

00:05:30.602 --> 00:05:32.297
 The solvent is dissolved in water 

00:05:32.297 --> 00:05:34.108
 Shipment associated with it 

00:05:34.108 --> 00:05:37.034
 Take table salt as an example 

00:05:37.034 --> 00:05:42.449
 So we have sodium ions 

00:05:42.449 --> 00:05:44.487
 Salt is sodium chloride 

00:05:44.487 --> 00:05:46.809
 But when placed in water, we get sodium ions 

00:05:46.809 --> 00:05:51.104
 Chloride ions 

00:05:51.104 --> 00:05:52.916
 Chloride ions are negative 

00:05:52.916 --> 00:05:56.805
 Sodium ions are positive 

00:05:56.805 --> 00:06:00.021
 Away from the idea of ​​mechanical blockage 

00:06:00.021 --> 00:06:02.575
 We mentioned it, there is another idea 

00:06:02.575 --> 00:06:07.149
 Since these are ionic molecules and carry loads 

00:06:07.149 --> 00:06:08.913
 Water also carries partial shipments 

00:06:08.913 --> 00:06:11.282
 It may stick to more water molecules 

00:06:11.282 --> 00:06:13.441
 So the water molecules that stick to it will not be able 

00:06:13.441 --> 00:06:16.715
 From passing through the membrane 

00:06:16.715 --> 00:06:19.536
 But what does water mean? 

00:06:19.536 --> 00:06:23.727
 The water molecule consists of 

00:06:23.727 --> 00:06:26.072
 An oxygen atom carries a partial negative charge 

00:06:26.072 --> 00:06:28.402
 And two hydrogen atoms 

00:06:28.402 --> 00:06:31.575
 Lyndon is so, if hydrogen atoms 

00:06:31.575 --> 00:06:35.360
 Carry a partial positive charge 

00:06:35.360 --> 00:06:37.659
 The oxygen tip is attracted 

00:06:37.659 --> 00:06:39.518
 Far from hydrogen 

00:06:39.518 --> 00:06:42.627
 To the sodium molecule 

00:06:42.627 --> 00:06:44.160
 Thus the sodium molecule can not pass through it 

00:06:44.160 --> 00:06:45.994
 The oxygen tip wants to stick to the sodium molecule 

00:06:45.994 --> 00:06:48.920
 You can imagine the attraction of all these water molecules 

00:06:48.920 --> 00:06:51.218
 To the sodium molecule 

00:06:51.218 --> 00:06:53.517
 Reducing the likelihood of the molecules moving 

00:06:53.517 --> 00:06:55.282
 From right to left compared to their probability of transmission 

00:06:55.282 --> 00:06:57.255
 From left to right 

00:06:57.255 --> 00:07:00.903
 Well, if we have negative ion charge like this 

00:07:00.903 --> 00:07:03.107
 We can direct water to the other side 

00:07:03.107 --> 00:07:07.240
 Where hydrogen particles are attracted by a partial negative charge 

00:07:07.240 --> 00:07:11.396
 To chloride ion located here 

00:07:11.396 --> 00:07:13.950
 Since the chloride ion will not be able to pass through 

00:07:13.950 --> 00:07:16.829
 This reduces the likelihood of transit 

00:07:16.829 --> 00:07:19.083
 These particles are attached to it 

00:07:19.083 --> 00:07:21.891
 The attraction of these molecules to 

00:07:21.891 --> 00:07:24.724
 More chloride or sodium ions 

00:07:24.724 --> 00:07:26.308
 From its attraction to other water molecules 

00:07:26.308 --> 00:07:27.626
 Partial shipments 

00:07:27.626 --> 00:07:31.054
 These fully charged particles will not be able to pass 

00:07:31.054 --> 00:07:33.315
 And the probability of passing these molecules as well 

00:07:33.315 --> 00:07:35.102
 Be slim 

00:07:35.102 --> 00:07:37.703
 But this has double implications 

00:07:37.703 --> 00:07:39.444
 I hope one of you shows me a simulation 

00:07:39.444 --> 00:07:41.023
 Good or we can work simulated for this 

00:07:41.023 --> 00:07:43.879
 Using the Khan Academy of Computer Science program 

00:07:43.879 --> 00:07:45.574
 The probability is that 

00:07:45.574 --> 00:07:47.826
 The passage of water molecules from left to right 

00:07:47.826 --> 00:07:50.172
 Are more likely to be moved from right to left 

00:07:50.172 --> 00:07:53.190
 This is due to mechanical blockage or these large particles 

00:07:53.190 --> 00:07:55.558
 Which bounce and push the water molecules in the wrong direction 

00:07:55.558 --> 00:07:57.787
 Or attraction of water molecules to these large molecules 

00:07:57.787 --> 00:08:00.388
 They carry a cargo 

00:08:00.388 --> 00:08:02.031
 This is the Osmotic property
