[Clapping]

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:09.210
David LeBatard: All right. Is this all right?
Can everybody hear me okay?

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:11.870
First, I'd like to thank everybody for coming
out today.

00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:16.680
I thought I was just going to be talking to
my five friends that I brought with me. [laughter]

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:19.710
And I'd especially like to thank all the people
at Google for allowing us the opportunity

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:23.090
to share this work with you.
Originally, I was going to do this as a sort

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:27.690
of question and answer thing, but last night
I decided to make it more of an interpretive

00:00:27.690 --> 00:00:30.900
dance.
So if you guys can all just come around me

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:34.480
and hold hands.
We'll do this like as an ice breaker, kind

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:41.180
of team building thing. [laughter] No.
You know, I was told just to kind of speak

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:46.550
briefly about the work that's here today.
I've been doing what I'm doing professionally

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:53.260
which is creating art for 14 years.
I've been creating art for 25 years.

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:58.000
And just recently when I was -- Darren is
the head of the Arts Fund, brought me into

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:02.110
the group, I guess about a year ago.
Up to that point, I was operating pretty much

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:04.899
independently.
And by the grace of God, I just always had

00:01:04.899 --> 00:01:09.330
people who were really supportive of my work.
And it kind of found its own direction and

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:14.000
I followed it and just applied what I had
to that.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:19.340
And that's what led me here today, so.
In regards to the work you see around you,

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:24.400
I don't know if you've all had a chance to
look around and check it out, but it's all

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:27.830
basically themed on flags from around the
world.

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:32.049
And then I coupled it with another theme that
I have been evolving lately, which is that

00:01:32.049 --> 00:01:36.450
about atomic weaponry and the splitting of
the atom, which is something I've been really

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:41.369
interested in on a scientific level in regards
to the physics involved with it.

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:45.400
And then in the way that it kind of changed
the course of humanity that now, you know,

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:49.290
since the 40's they basically have been able
to destroy ourselves, so.

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:53.590
I really find that's pretty interesting in
terms of the way it changes the dynamics of

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:59.250
how we think.
And then the other thing about it is that

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:03.140
I've really liked to explore themes that define
who we are.

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:07.070
And I feel like flags are one of those things
on a broad level that define who we are, but

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:11.581
in a way they also divide who we are.
They move us away from becoming closer together

00:02:11.581 --> 00:02:14.669
a lot of times.
So in the micro, they might bring us closer

00:02:14.669 --> 00:02:16.260
together.
And then, on the macro, which is globally,

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:20.669
it pretty much separates all of us.
That's why the last flag that I decided to

00:02:20.669 --> 00:02:24.650
do -- I wasn't really sure about the last
three that I was going to do -- so I was going

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:29.950
back and forth with Darren actually and trying
to figure out maybe Tibet would have made

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:33.480
sense, maybe England would have made sense.
And in the end, really what made the most

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:36.269
sense was just doing a white flag, which is
the surrender.

00:02:36.269 --> 00:02:40.059
And I always feel that if we had a little
bit more of that, we'd probably have less

00:02:40.059 --> 00:02:45.609
of the things that are negative, so.
I could go on and on about it, but I'll keep

00:02:45.609 --> 00:02:47.659
it at that.
And if there's any questions or anything,

00:02:47.659 --> 00:02:49.780
I'd be happy to answer them.

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:53.330
&gt;&gt; If you have questions, please come up to
the mic.

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:56.540
David LeBatard: Or just stone cold silence
is good too. [laughter]

00:02:56.540 --> 00:03:05.639
I'm going to dance either way, so. No.
He might have a question there.

00:03:05.639 --> 00:03:08.909
Q So what was the final selection process
for which flags you chose?

00:03:08.909 --> 00:03:12.650
I mean, you know, it sounds like you took
into account political strife somehow.

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:17.589
But, it's a pretty diverse array of flags.
Could you go into a couple of specifics?

00:03:17.589 --> 00:03:19.923
David LeBatard: Sure. Sure. And by the way,
all the guitars -- I don't know if there's

00:03:19.923 --> 00:03:22.499
any guitar players -- but it's made that they
can be taken down.

00:03:22.499 --> 00:03:25.839
They're not tuned yet, but you're more than
welcome, and actually encouraged to do it.

00:03:25.839 --> 00:03:30.430
If any of the pieces get scuffed or whatever,
I'll touch them up at the end, but.

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:34.349
I guess the selection process, I was working
 -- like I said, I'm going to keep referencing

00:03:34.349 --> 00:03:36.419
 -- but Darren was with me while I working
through most of it.

00:03:36.419 --> 00:03:39.560
And I really, you know, I get a chance to
work by myself a lot.

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:43.599
I think the life of a painter is a pretty
solitary life, but I really like the collaborative

00:03:43.599 --> 00:03:46.689
experience as well.
So, Darren and I went back and forth about

00:03:46.689 --> 00:03:50.099
a lot.
The first two were Cuban flag and the American

00:03:50.099 --> 00:03:52.909
flag.
I'm first generation Cuban American to Cuban

00:03:52.909 --> 00:03:58.239
parents, but also within the whole arms race.
And you know really holds a really -- it's

00:03:58.239 --> 00:04:01.510
the first, the only time the United States
has really been butt up against that question

00:04:01.510 --> 00:04:06.729
of destroying ourselves in a real way.
So those were kind of -- went without question.

00:04:06.729 --> 00:04:10.119
And then it really started -- I guess there
was nine countries that have nuclear capabilities

00:04:10.119 --> 00:04:11.590
now.
So then we sorted through those.

00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:15.290
I don't think I really wanted to do all of
those, but those definitely played a factor

00:04:15.290 --> 00:04:18.419
into it.
The Korean flag which is, I actually did South

00:04:18.419 --> 00:04:23.229
Korean rather than North Korean, but just
the whole Korean factor.

00:04:23.229 --> 00:04:26.370
It's kind of one of the, you know, rogue factors.
I think they all are.

00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:31.699
But with the arms race and all that.
And I think beyond that, the rest just kind

00:04:31.699 --> 00:04:34.919
of happened organically.
The Soviet flag was actually the second to

00:04:34.919 --> 00:04:37.260
last one.
When I thought about it, I'm like, "Oh, that

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:41.240
really should have been probably one of the
top three, because -- for 40-some-odd years

00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:43.620
 -- that's really what kept the whole arms
race going.

00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:47.009
And then that got replaced right away.
We had like ten years of not worrying about

00:04:47.009 --> 00:04:48.789
it.
And then now it's 'dirty bombs' is what we

00:04:48.789 --> 00:04:53.009
worry about.
So -- and like I said, the rest really happened

00:04:53.009 --> 00:04:55.930
very organically.
And I've noticed, at this point in my career,

00:04:55.930 --> 00:05:00.479
when I'm working on a series and I'm very
focused on it, the very last piece that I

00:05:00.479 --> 00:05:04.389
do is usually the most poignant and it's usually
the most stripped down and minimal piece.

00:05:04.389 --> 00:05:08.860
And it generally leads to the next series.
So that's why the all-white one was the last

00:05:08.860 --> 00:05:09.860
one, so.

00:05:09.860 --> 00:05:13.009
&gt;&gt; Thanks, Jesse.

00:05:13.009 --> 00:05:21.780
David LeBatard: Guy in the ponytail. [laughter]

00:05:21.780 --> 00:05:25.569
Q So I was wondering about the musical references
in here.

00:05:25.569 --> 00:05:30.240
I was wandering around earlier today and thinking,
"Okay, I'm trying to sort of associate the

00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:33.750
music with the nation."
And I'm like, "No, maybe there isn't one there."

00:05:33.750 --> 00:05:37.659
And that's okay. I don't mind.
I like the friction between things.

00:05:37.659 --> 00:05:41.251
But I'm curious about the musical references
if you have anything to say on them.

00:05:41.251 --> 00:05:44.300
David LeBatard: Yeah, absolutely. And I appreciate
your question.

00:05:44.300 --> 00:05:50.960
Well, one of the -- Adidas and Gibson are
big branding partners that I've had over the

00:05:50.960 --> 00:05:53.400
years, so.
I think just being able to paint on guitars

00:05:53.400 --> 00:05:55.730
and being able to do that is a really nice,
positive thing.

00:05:55.730 --> 00:06:00.139
But one of the things that I noticed is one
 -- when I was a kid, and having been an artist

00:06:00.139 --> 00:06:03.280
my whole life, you kind of chronicle in a
way when you look at it in hindsight.

00:06:03.280 --> 00:06:07.550
You have a visual chronicle of what you were
feeling and what you were thinking at the

00:06:07.550 --> 00:06:09.941
time.
And when I was younger, I was very much in

00:06:09.941 --> 00:06:13.030
the punk rock movement.
And you know all my early art was really about

00:06:13.030 --> 00:06:15.230
doing punk rock artwork and flyers and all
that.

00:06:15.230 --> 00:06:20.009
And at that point in my life, looking back
on it, I remember it was all about finding

00:06:20.009 --> 00:06:22.389
differences with stuff.
Everything was kind of like, "Well, this isn't

00:06:22.389 --> 00:06:24.620
like that, and I'm not like this." and so
on and so forth.

00:06:24.620 --> 00:06:29.520
Well, slowly -- and I really got introduced
to Eastern philosophy and Buddhism and all

00:06:29.520 --> 00:06:32.509
that -- and then that kind of shifted into
really trying to find the things that make

00:06:32.509 --> 00:06:35.980
us similar.
So that's why things like the flags and all

00:06:35.980 --> 00:06:40.620
these other -- I really like to use what I
consider 'universal' images and symbols now.

00:06:40.620 --> 00:06:42.900
And also, music is one of those things -- it's
a unifier.

00:06:42.900 --> 00:06:51.990
And it rarely divides. It almost always unifies.
So I thought that was a good juxtaposition

00:06:51.990 --> 00:06:56.919
against that.
Everyone just stare at me. I'm feeling this.

00:06:56.919 --> 00:07:01.060
Q Hey thanks, Lebo, very much for coming.
And you kind of touched on your last answer,

00:07:01.060 --> 00:07:06.180
but I was wondering if you could speak more
to, you know, the 25 years that have led up

00:07:06.180 --> 00:07:08.800
to this series.
I notice that you have a lot of kind of graffiti

00:07:08.800 --> 00:07:13.909
stylings and some of your previous art that
may have influenced the style that this series

00:07:13.909 --> 00:07:14.909
captures.

00:07:14.909 --> 00:07:16.520
David LeBatard: Okay, yeah. That's a good
question.

00:07:16.520 --> 00:07:19.759
Yeah, my work gets lumped into the graffiti
thing a lot.

00:07:19.759 --> 00:07:23.999
But I think, when I was a kid, what drew me
to the graffiti were the characters.

00:07:23.999 --> 00:07:27.659
And some less than the words.
And what I started doing was researching,

00:07:27.659 --> 00:07:30.479
Where did these characters come from?
And that led me into the history of cartooning

00:07:30.479 --> 00:07:35.349
and I was fortunate enough to be assistant
curator at a cartoon museum for three years.

00:07:35.349 --> 00:07:40.639
So, within that time, I was really able to
see the way that iconography identifies different

00:07:40.639 --> 00:07:43.280
periods of time and different people and different
emotions.

00:07:43.280 --> 00:07:47.349
And, I mean, when I was working at that museum,
I was able to handle the first drawings of

00:07:47.349 --> 00:07:51.309
Mickey Mouse. And things that might seem silly
to most people, but to me, that was always

00:07:51.309 --> 00:07:54.370
kind of like a religion growing up was drawing
and all that.

00:07:54.370 --> 00:07:58.029
So, I was able to get that from a real academic
standpoint.

00:07:58.029 --> 00:08:02.370
And then, I also backpacked around a lot and
did a lot of stuff -- street stuff -- not

00:08:02.370 --> 00:08:05.629
necessarily graffiti when I was a kid.
But I would -- especially when I was in Europe

00:08:05.629 --> 00:08:09.059
 -- I would do a lot of art on the street,
and I would meet people, because I didn't

00:08:09.059 --> 00:08:11.751
have that much money.
So a lot of times I'd meet people on the street

00:08:11.751 --> 00:08:13.810
that would let me stay with them based on
what I was doing.

00:08:13.810 --> 00:08:17.800
And to me, it was all kind of connecting with
people that didn't speak the same language,

00:08:17.800 --> 00:08:22.061
but through this medium of iconography and
cartooning and it was really powerful and

00:08:22.061 --> 00:08:25.919
it was really empowering too.
And that's when I was really broke and I didn't

00:08:25.919 --> 00:08:31.539
have anything really to fall back on except
that want to do it and the real passion to

00:08:31.539 --> 00:08:35.360
do it.
And then in the last -- I mean, that was probably

00:08:35.360 --> 00:08:40.210
15 years ago -- it's just gone through different
manifestations of being able to really have

00:08:40.210 --> 00:08:44.500
a certain vision and a certain philosophy.
And almost inherently, it attracts itself

00:08:44.500 --> 00:08:48.589
to other like energy, which led me to being
here and being with the Arts Fund and all

00:08:48.589 --> 00:08:51.370
those things.
So it's all been through the scope of cartooning

00:08:51.370 --> 00:08:52.370
basically.

00:08:52.370 --> 00:08:53.370
&gt;&gt; [pause]

00:08:53.370 --> 00:09:03.230
David LeBatard: Girls don't ask questions
at Google it seems. [laughter]

00:09:03.230 --> 00:09:10.380
Q Thanks for coming. A few questions.
I guess, What made you go from freelance to

00:09:10.380 --> 00:09:12.889
join the Arts Fund?
What inspired you to do that change?

00:09:12.889 --> 00:09:17.149
And then, maybe a greater question, What does
the Arts Fund -- what's the mission statement?

00:09:17.149 --> 00:09:18.270
And how do you support artists?

00:09:18.270 --> 00:09:21.960
David LeBatard: Okay. Well, I think one of
the original things that drew me to it is

00:09:21.960 --> 00:09:26.080
that they came to me because I was independent
and because I never really considered myself

00:09:26.080 --> 00:09:28.340
freelance.
I just never considered myself wanting to

00:09:28.340 --> 00:09:31.740
work for anybody else.
But I think the part -- and I'll answer for

00:09:31.740 --> 00:09:37.029
Darren -- I think part of the philosophy of
Arts Fund is to enable artists that are working

00:09:37.029 --> 00:09:40.980
in non-traditional ways to basically have
their Renaissance period.

00:09:40.980 --> 00:09:43.279
And that's something that we've discussed
a few times.

00:09:43.279 --> 00:09:47.899
And basically, before I was at Arts Fund,
everything I would have to do would be balanced

00:09:47.899 --> 00:09:52.760
out between making money through selling my
own art and then saving some of that money

00:09:52.760 --> 00:09:56.380
aside from the one to live to fund projects
that were really, really, labor-of-love-type

00:09:56.380 --> 00:09:59.089
projects.
So I had to be really streamlined and stripped

00:09:59.089 --> 00:10:01.371
down to the bone in order to really operate
the way I wanted to.

00:10:01.371 --> 00:10:05.601
Darren was able to recognize that right away.
And he's like, "Well, basically we want to

00:10:05.601 --> 00:10:09.199
let you keep doing that, but you don't have
to worry about saving your own money and all

00:10:09.199 --> 00:10:11.670
that.
We'll be able to help you finance those things.

00:10:11.670 --> 00:10:14.220
And we'll do it in a very strategic, smart
way.

00:10:14.220 --> 00:10:17.761
And we'll find ways to input it into all these
nontraditional ways." which is what I already

00:10:17.761 --> 00:10:20.320
was doing.
So it was a real natural fit.

00:10:20.320 --> 00:10:23.640
There was basically -- and I've mentioned
this to them a few times -- they took all

00:10:23.640 --> 00:10:25.781
the stuff I didn't like about it before, what
I was doing.

00:10:25.781 --> 00:10:28.630
Or I shouldn't say I didn't like it, but it
was the more taxing part of it.

00:10:28.630 --> 00:10:32.220
And then allowed me to just do really what
I always struggled to do was -- that's just

00:10:32.220 --> 00:10:39.810
create independently in my own space and try
to deliver something that would be thought-provoking.

00:10:39.810 --> 00:10:43.339
One girl question -- we've got to recruit
a woman.

00:10:43.339 --> 00:10:54.079
Q Okay. Can you talk about the permanent piece
that's outside the cafe so that we can get

00:10:54.079 --> 00:10:56.740
the back story and have that, since it's going
to be here forever?

00:10:56.740 --> 00:11:01.000
David LeBatard: Yeah. I'd be happy.
Briefly, I mean, that piece was very inspired

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:05.720
as an abstract, expressionist artist from
the New York School from the 50's named Robert

00:11:05.720 --> 00:11:08.089
Motherwell.
And I'm not sure if any of you are familiar

00:11:08.089 --> 00:11:09.800
with him, but if you aren't, you should check
him out.

00:11:09.800 --> 00:11:13.970
But, he's somebody -- I've studied a lot of
abstract work for years and years, so -- he's

00:11:13.970 --> 00:11:17.430
one that I always try to go back to over and
over and interpret what he was doing in my

00:11:17.430 --> 00:11:19.820
own way.
I don't necessarily think I'm effective as

00:11:19.820 --> 00:11:22.320
he was, but I definitely use that as the starting
point.

00:11:22.320 --> 00:11:27.620
So that piece was basically trying to create
something that was -- of where I think he

00:11:27.620 --> 00:11:30.630
was trying to go in his work.
And if you don't know who he is, then it's

00:11:30.630 --> 00:11:33.380
not going to make much sense.
But if you do check it out, I think you'll

00:11:33.380 --> 00:11:38.389
get it that I was trying to basically do a
piece that was platforming itself off of him

00:11:38.389 --> 00:11:41.970
and then just creating another message there
that's more of an open note -- I don't really

00:11:41.970 --> 00:11:43.410
want to get into exactly what the message
is.

00:11:43.410 --> 00:11:48.550
Because I've found that, as the artist, once
you give your intention of what went into

00:11:48.550 --> 00:11:51.769
making that piece, that the viewer kind of
discounts their own.

00:11:51.769 --> 00:11:55.079
And I think that it's kind of like birthing
a baby that you have to let it live its own

00:11:55.079 --> 00:11:57.389
life.
So, you know, I'll just leave it that the

00:11:57.389 --> 00:12:02.690
fact that I really wanted to just kind of
make an homage to Robert Motherwell's work

00:12:02.690 --> 00:12:06.279
and put a narrative through that that I felt
 -- again had that sort of universal ring

00:12:06.279 --> 00:12:12.350
to it, so.
Here we go. Things are heating up now.

00:12:12.350 --> 00:12:19.190
Q Hello. Thanks for coming.
So this is just an aesthetic question.

00:12:19.190 --> 00:12:27.410
And flags are obviously usually rectangular
and yours has like an ellipse -- oblong -- so

00:12:27.410 --> 00:12:30.540
I'm just wondering what the decision is around
that?

00:12:30.540 --> 00:12:35.290
David LeBatard: Sure. I think in general I
prefer curve lines to hard lines.

00:12:35.290 --> 00:12:37.920
And I don't know, maybe that's more of a feminine
sensibility.

00:12:37.920 --> 00:12:42.090
I grew up -- I taught a lot of kids to draw
when I was younger and one thing I noticed

00:12:42.090 --> 00:12:46.569
that girls have a very curved organic line,
and boys tend to have a very kind of rigid,

00:12:46.569 --> 00:12:50.010
mechanical line when they draw.
And for whatever reason, I've always favored

00:12:50.010 --> 00:12:54.510
kind of curved organic -- if I see like hard
angles, my instinct is to want to smooth them

00:12:54.510 --> 00:12:55.510
out, so.

00:12:55.510 --> 00:13:00.310
Q Thanks.

00:13:00.310 --> 00:13:02.970
&gt;&gt; [pause]

00:13:02.970 --> 00:13:13.949
Q Hi. I was wondering if you feel influenced
by technology we have as a technology company

00:13:13.949 --> 00:13:17.290
and you mention things that unify as well
as divide.

00:13:17.290 --> 00:13:21.779
So you have the Internet which is sort of
breaking down walls -- unify.

00:13:21.779 --> 00:13:26.480
And yet, there's also people who are not sort
of online, and they talk about that as being

00:13:26.480 --> 00:13:32.310
the 'Digital Divide'. So it also divides us.
And I was wondering if you feel that influence

00:13:32.310 --> 00:13:35.350
and have thought about how that might play
into your work?

00:13:35.350 --> 00:13:38.970
David LeBatard: Yeah, that's an excellent
question.

00:13:38.970 --> 00:13:43.060
I guess I thought about it a few years ago,
because at one point I had the philosophy

00:13:43.060 --> 00:13:45.290
that I was a craftsman.
And I still feel that way -- that I was a

00:13:45.290 --> 00:13:49.790
very 'hands on' person.
And it was about the tactile part of the art.

00:13:49.790 --> 00:13:54.339
So I was a little hesitant to start working
on computers and be able to apply myself to

00:13:54.339 --> 00:13:56.480
that.
But then, once I made that switch, I realized

00:13:56.480 --> 00:14:00.010
it just added to my toolbox.
I could basically -- now I can do twice as

00:14:00.010 --> 00:14:03.310
many things.
And then, one of the other things I realize

00:14:03.310 --> 00:14:09.269
is that the format of cartooning -- you know,
I've studied ancient Asian languages -- all

00:14:09.269 --> 00:14:14.680
started off as iconography.
Egyptian languages were all iconic.

00:14:14.680 --> 00:14:17.500
Everything basically, up until about 10,000
years ago, were pictures.

00:14:17.500 --> 00:14:21.500
And I think that the art that I practice is
really about that tradition.

00:14:21.500 --> 00:14:25.779
And that tradition plugs in perfectly to computer.
Because computers are becoming -- even though

00:14:25.779 --> 00:14:28.220
blogs are very popular and all that -- it's
still visual.

00:14:28.220 --> 00:14:31.730
It's still about pictures.
And I found the more direct the picture is

00:14:31.730 --> 00:14:36.100
and the easier it is to relay a message, the
more effective it is.

00:14:36.100 --> 00:14:40.450
So I'm very fortunate that, for years and
years, I was just developing that on my own

00:14:40.450 --> 00:14:44.269
because I just wanted a visual language basically
to be able to speak through.

00:14:44.269 --> 00:14:47.410
And then I realize, "Well, wow! Everything
I'm doing visually -- whether it's these flags

00:14:47.410 --> 00:14:51.170
or big murals or anything -- once you put
them online, they have a million different

00:14:51.170 --> 00:14:53.940
ways to apply them outside of what they're
originally intended for."

00:14:53.940 --> 00:14:58.769
So as far as I'm concerned, I still get to
apply myself the way I grew up applying.

00:14:58.769 --> 00:15:02.600
My goal has always been able to be a draftsman
that's able to articulate the world around

00:15:02.600 --> 00:15:04.199
him.
That's never stopped being my goal.

00:15:04.199 --> 00:15:07.509
Even now, it's still my goal.
And even though I'm seen as a painter, in

00:15:07.509 --> 00:15:10.570
my mind, I'm still a draftsman.
And that's all I really long to be.

00:15:10.570 --> 00:15:15.309
So now, I can work in sketchbooks or on canvas
and then -- the mural that I finished yesterday

00:15:15.309 --> 00:15:19.100
 -- normally without technology, people would
have to drive by and see it.

00:15:19.100 --> 00:15:22.009
Thankfully, it's been posted and I've been
getting e-mails from people all over the country.

00:15:22.009 --> 00:15:24.459
They're like, "Wow, that's really cool."
And I was like, "Man, that just got finished

00:15:24.459 --> 00:15:26.560
tonight."
And that's something that I don't think has

00:15:26.560 --> 00:15:30.570
ever been able to really -- you know, this
is a pivotal point for that kind of contact.

00:15:30.570 --> 00:15:34.360
And from my perspective, I really appreciate
it.

00:15:34.360 --> 00:15:41.829
Q Although I feel like cartoon art, so to
speak -- it's a higher level of legitimacy

00:15:41.829 --> 00:15:45.600
than graffiti art, in the sense that there
are cartoon art museums and not really graffiti

00:15:45.600 --> 00:15:48.699
art museums.
There are a lot of elements of graffiti in

00:15:48.699 --> 00:15:50.730
your work and in other cartoonists.
Could you talk about, you know, maybe the

00:15:50.730 --> 00:15:55.699
relationship between those two styles or how
graffiti has influenced your work specifically?

00:15:55.699 --> 00:15:59.329
David LeBatard: Sure. Yeah I mean, I think
both graffiti and cartooning are about making

00:15:59.329 --> 00:16:04.370
a direct impact on the viewer.
And in general, it's unfettered.

00:16:04.370 --> 00:16:06.600
It doesn't have a gallery.
There's nothing that needs to be really in

00:16:06.600 --> 00:16:10.100
the way of that.
So I think -- I would say that they probably

00:16:10.100 --> 00:16:13.790
relate more conceptually.
I mean, they obviously relate aesthetically

00:16:13.790 --> 00:16:16.649
to one another.
But conceptually, I think it's about having

00:16:16.649 --> 00:16:20.852
the freedom to just be able to interact with
the viewer and not necessarily have to have

00:16:20.852 --> 00:16:25.170
a middleman in the way of that.
And I know that my early career in Miami was

00:16:25.170 --> 00:16:28.149
established on three or four years of just
doing murals on the street.

00:16:28.149 --> 00:16:32.379
And, you know, I was 23 at the time, and I
was just really hungry for it.

00:16:32.379 --> 00:16:35.180
So I was getting -- even when I didn't have
contracts to do murals -- I was doing them

00:16:35.180 --> 00:16:38.389
for free wherever I could.
And I always had paintings in the back of

00:16:38.389 --> 00:16:39.760
my car that I finished in my house that I'd
be selling.

00:16:39.760 --> 00:16:44.449
To me, it was just about the hustle of it.
But what I realize is that, Man, people really

00:16:44.449 --> 00:16:47.040
got it at that gut level.
It didn't need to be explained.

00:16:47.040 --> 00:16:48.250
It didn't need a lot of art history behind
it.

00:16:48.250 --> 00:16:52.120
People just really reacted to it at a guttural
level, which I think is the way people should

00:16:52.120 --> 00:16:55.129
react.
It's great to have art that has a manifesto

00:16:55.129 --> 00:16:58.199
and has a bunch of different components.
But, in the end, I think you really need to

00:16:58.199 --> 00:17:01.680
tell a story that -- on the surface -- a lot
of people can relate to, and then there's

00:17:01.680 --> 00:17:05.850
a lot of layers and complexity to it that
people can plug into further if they want

00:17:05.850 --> 00:17:08.560
to.
And I think graffiti has that quality as well

00:17:08.560 --> 00:17:12.370
when it's done in its most, you know, elevated
form.

00:17:12.370 --> 00:17:18.540
Q Thank you so much for being here.

00:17:18.540 --> 00:17:21.150
David LeBatard: Sure. Thank you.

00:17:21.150 --> 00:17:28.410
Q Testing. Is this thing working? Okay.
I was just wondering, in terms of graffiti

00:17:28.410 --> 00:17:32.450
and your mural painting, How much does the
space inspire you?

00:17:32.450 --> 00:17:36.210
Like, when you drive down the street, do you
see a wall and you're just like, "Oh, man.

00:17:36.210 --> 00:17:38.910
I wish I could go off to that wall and create
a space."

00:17:38.910 --> 00:17:42.680
And did you have to see this space before
you created this beautiful installation?

00:17:42.680 --> 00:17:45.930
David LeBatard: Thank you. That's an excellent
question.

00:17:45.930 --> 00:17:49.500
I think yeah. I think when you're a visual
artist, I think when you're any kind of artist,

00:17:49.500 --> 00:17:52.810
you kind of see things.
You know, what I should say that what I realize

00:17:52.810 --> 00:17:55.530
about all visual arts is that it's basically
arrangements and shape.

00:17:55.530 --> 00:17:59.580
Or you're basically arranging -- you're taking
whatever shape you have, whether it's an empty

00:17:59.580 --> 00:18:02.440
room or an empty canvas.
And it's funny with buildings.

00:18:02.440 --> 00:18:05.970
I don't see buildings -- like when I see a
building, I don't necessarily look at it as

00:18:05.970 --> 00:18:09.240
like, "Oh, that's a place for a mural."
I see like six buildings and I'll be like,

00:18:09.240 --> 00:18:11.390
"Oh, that'd be a great place to do a composition
like this."

00:18:11.390 --> 00:18:14.290
We were talking about -- or a whole city block
or the side of a bridge.

00:18:14.290 --> 00:18:18.080
Like, I still think that that medium hasn't
really scratched the surface in what it's

00:18:18.080 --> 00:18:20.770
able to do yet.
Because like even that -- like doing a mural

00:18:20.770 --> 00:18:24.420
on the side of that big wall in the bridge
and then doing a mural on a boat that's going

00:18:24.420 --> 00:18:26.760
to pass by it.
And then having them be able to like interact

00:18:26.760 --> 00:18:29.560
together.
That's really the way that I look at space.

00:18:29.560 --> 00:18:33.890
And a lot of it's just being able to -- from
when I was a kid, that's where I lost myself

00:18:33.890 --> 00:18:37.640
was in the space of one little page like that.
And I basically saw the whole universe kind

00:18:37.640 --> 00:18:40.490
of come out of that over the years.
And I just worked in black and white.

00:18:40.490 --> 00:18:44.610
I didn't even work in -- I didn't start making
 -- when I started working in color, I started

00:18:44.610 --> 00:18:47.300
making a living almost the same -- six months
later.

00:18:47.300 --> 00:18:49.240
So, for all that time before, it was all black
and white.

00:18:49.240 --> 00:18:52.560
It was all delineation; it was all just trying
to figure out.

00:18:52.560 --> 00:18:56.490
In hindsight, it was really trying to figure
out like kind of God's dynamic -- the mechanism

00:18:56.490 --> 00:19:00.260
that makes things the same.
So whether, you know, I'd go out in the field

00:19:00.260 --> 00:19:03.691
and I'd draw a bush or I'd draw leaf studies
and things like that.

00:19:03.691 --> 00:19:06.630
But then I'd also come and draw my mom's hands
and thing like that.

00:19:06.630 --> 00:19:09.200
And I'd also be drawing these little cartoon
characters and stuff.

00:19:09.200 --> 00:19:12.951
So at one point, all those things started
to reveal a larger truth that was really a

00:19:12.951 --> 00:19:15.710
simple truth.
And that's the nicest things about them is

00:19:15.710 --> 00:19:18.400
that I find the more profound truths are the
real simple ones.

00:19:18.400 --> 00:19:21.550
And that's what I like about cartooning too
 -- it's very direct, and there's not really

00:19:21.550 --> 00:19:25.610
any pretense to it -- not in its physical
application and not really so much in the

00:19:25.610 --> 00:19:29.390
way that it's defined, so.
I don't know if that answers your question.

00:19:29.390 --> 00:19:30.390
Q Thank you.

00:19:30.390 --> 00:19:35.150
David LeBatard: That long-winded answer answer
your question.

00:19:35.150 --> 00:19:36.400
&gt;&gt; [pause]

00:19:36.400 --> 00:19:42.570
Q Thanks for coming, Lebo. I love the work.
Question around Adidas and Gibson like, What

00:19:42.570 --> 00:19:44.990
are they expecting from you?
And, What do you feel obligated to do for

00:19:44.990 --> 00:19:46.700
them?
And then also a little bit about like the

00:19:46.700 --> 00:19:51.870
economics or business model behind Arts Fund.
Like, What is it that you guys are getting

00:19:51.870 --> 00:19:54.940
out of it?
Do you get, for example, percentage of sales

00:19:54.940 --> 00:19:56.600
of future work sold etc.?

00:19:56.600 --> 00:20:01.950
David LeBatard: The latter part yeah I think
I'm better equipped to answer the first part

00:20:01.950 --> 00:20:03.710
about it.
But I've been real fortunate.

00:20:03.710 --> 00:20:07.140
Like my relationship with Gibson basically
started that there was these Gibson reps in

00:20:07.140 --> 00:20:10.320
Miami that asked me to paint a guitar for
them.

00:20:10.320 --> 00:20:14.780
And in return, they gave me a really expensive
guitar in return for that.

00:20:14.780 --> 00:20:18.250
So it was very much -- we did that as a barter
for six months where I had this collection

00:20:18.250 --> 00:20:19.710
 -- I don't play any instruments or anything
like that.

00:20:19.710 --> 00:20:22.310
[laughter] What I basically -- I didn't know
what to do with them.

00:20:22.310 --> 00:20:25.650
But I basically painted on them, and then
I sold them.

00:20:25.650 --> 00:20:27.490
And at the time, it was for a whole lot of
money.

00:20:27.490 --> 00:20:30.640
And I was like, "Wow, okay. I spend a day
painting this guitar for them.

00:20:30.640 --> 00:20:33.620
I spend another day doing it for me. And I
made as much as I'd like to make in a week

00:20:33.620 --> 00:20:37.670
normally for what I do."
So, and that's the part of the thing that

00:20:37.670 --> 00:20:40.750
the Arts Fund enables me to do.
That's not my normal method of thinking, but

00:20:40.750 --> 00:20:44.660
as a survival skill, I had to be like, "All
right, I got to make this much money every

00:20:44.660 --> 00:20:48.580
month to be able to pay my mortgage and put
a little bit away in the bank." and so on

00:20:48.580 --> 00:20:51.520
and so forth.
So back to the Arts Fund thing.

00:20:51.520 --> 00:20:53.400
They've enabled me to not have to worry about
that as much.

00:20:53.400 --> 00:20:56.620
Even though -- just being independent and
a self-starter -- that's the way I always

00:20:56.620 --> 00:20:59.540
think.
And then -- and Gibson never asked me to do

00:20:59.540 --> 00:21:03.400
anything outside of what I wanted to do.
And I've always kind of favored the approach

00:21:03.400 --> 00:21:07.020
to just work really hard and produce work
rather than get into the political part of

00:21:07.020 --> 00:21:08.590
art.
Because, in the end, that's what I wanted

00:21:08.590 --> 00:21:11.630
to hold on to the most.
And I really feel like -- the people that

00:21:11.630 --> 00:21:15.280
are attracted to my work -- they understand
that vision.

00:21:15.280 --> 00:21:18.980
And I've been given some really nice jobs
and some really great projects that I never

00:21:18.980 --> 00:21:21.880
would have thought I had the freedom to do
what I did with them.

00:21:21.880 --> 00:21:25.260
And the Adidas relationship and the Gibson
is just an extension of that.

00:21:25.260 --> 00:21:29.860
And when Gibson -- the showroom that I share
with Gibson at home is bigger than this whole

00:21:29.860 --> 00:21:31.100
room.
And it's by appointment only.

00:21:31.100 --> 00:21:33.820
They don't sell anything out of it.
It's just a showcase for their instruments

00:21:33.820 --> 00:21:36.870
and things like that.
And they asked me to do three installations

00:21:36.870 --> 00:21:40.480
for them that were similar to this.
And in return, they gave me keys to the place

00:21:40.480 --> 00:21:43.490
and parking, and basically, access whenever
I want to use it.

00:21:43.490 --> 00:21:48.960
So most of the -- actually, all of the relationships,
whether they're friendships or business relationships,

00:21:48.960 --> 00:21:51.640
they're all very symbiotic.
And there's always a real positive give and

00:21:51.640 --> 00:21:53.001
take.
And I don't think there needs to be a lot

00:21:53.001 --> 00:21:55.801
of sacrifice to it.
I mean, even in relationships with, you know,

00:21:55.801 --> 00:22:00.600
girlfriend or something like that, which I
don't have -- I'm very single, so. [laughter]

00:22:00.600 --> 00:22:04.960
But, you know, that it really should be about
not making compromises all the time.

00:22:04.960 --> 00:22:07.310
It should be about a natural fit.
And of course, you're going to smooth out

00:22:07.310 --> 00:22:11.370
the edges and things like that, but overall,
it should just kind of be something that feels

00:22:11.370 --> 00:22:15.380
right for both parties.
So I don't know if that answers either -- I

00:22:15.380 --> 00:22:20.260
feel like I'm getting off course a little
sometimes. [pause]

00:22:20.260 --> 00:22:26.630
I think that's -- so now, you're ready for
the dance? [laughter]

00:22:26.630 --> 00:22:29.930
So yeah, if there's no more questions.
And you're all welcome to come up to me individually

00:22:29.930 --> 00:22:34.660
for whatever reason, so.
I will bite, but only by request so. [laughter]

00:22:34.660 --> 00:22:39.549
&gt;&gt; Thank you very much. Thank you.

00:22:39.549 --> 00:22:40.549
&gt;&gt; [Clapping]

00:22:40.549 --> 00:22:41.179
&gt;&gt; [silent]
