it doesn't make sense and then

that children who received antibiotics

a crazy prediction and but I really

00:09:41.150 --> 00:09:41.160
a crazy prediction and but I really
 

00:09:41.160 --> 00:09:42.350
a crazy prediction and but I really

the conclusion that antibiotics were
destroying our health it may well be

destroying our health it may well be
 

00:09:50.250 --> 00:09:52.129
destroying our health it may well be
that we look at antibiotics the same way

we look at those leeches that they use

we look at those leeches that they use
 

00:09:54.209 --> 00:09:57.290
we look at those leeches that they use
to suck out blood from patients in in in

to suck out blood from patients in in in
 

00:09:57.300 --> 00:10:00.110
to suck out blood from patients in in in
in England and you know the belief was

in England and you know the belief was
 

00:10:00.120 --> 00:10:01.610
in England and you know the belief was
that you could cure health by sucking

00:10:01.610 --> 00:10:01.620
that you could cure health by sucking
 

00:10:01.620 --> 00:10:04.129
that you could cure health by sucking
out blood using leeches okay that may be

00:10:04.129 --> 00:10:04.139
out blood using leeches okay that may be

now so what I'm saying is that by 2030
 

00:21:26.590 --> 00:21:30.840
now so what I'm saying is that by 2030
or so we could have unlimited clean

this seems crazy this seems unimaginable
but all you have to do is look at the

00:21:47.820 --> 00:21:47.830
but all you have to do is look at the
 

00:21:47.830 --> 00:21:49.680
but all you have to do is look at the
data look at the trend it is as clear as

having to drive anymore we have autonomy

00:33:27.489 --> 00:33:27.499
having to drive anymore we have autonomy

like we've never had before because of
 

00:33:29.479 --> 00:33:31.149
like we've never had before because of
self-driving cars but then we lose

00:33:31.149 --> 00:33:31.159
self-driving cars but then we lose

highways so you have a trade-off over

here the question is does it lead to
does technology lead to dependence or

00:33:41.829 --> 00:33:41.839
does technology lead to dependence or

autonomy in the case of self-driving
 

00:33:43.459 --> 00:33:45.789
autonomy in the case of self-driving
cars it's both dependence and autonomy

00:33:45.789 --> 00:33:45.799
cars it's both dependence and autonomy
 

00:33:45.799 --> 00:33:47.889
