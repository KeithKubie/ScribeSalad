- Health officials in
California are warning people

00:00:05.939 --> 00:00:09.342 align:start size:88% position:13%
to stay away from
so-called measles party.

00:00:09.342 --> 00:00:11.144 align:start size:84% position:16%
The get-togethers
are meant for parents

00:00:11.144 --> 00:00:13.980 align:start size:88% position:13%
to intentionally expose
kids to the disease

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:16.216
to develop a natural immunity.

00:00:16.216 --> 00:00:17.951
- Measles parties, guys!

00:00:17.951 --> 00:00:19.586
(audience boos)

00:00:19.586 --> 00:00:20.820 align:start size:84% position:16%
- Yeah, you don't
get to participate in
the liberal society!

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:22.655 align:start size:84% position:16%
- Lemme...I used to
hate it when, you know

00:00:22.655 --> 00:00:24.224 align:start size:88% position:13%
when you have a birthday
party for your kid,

00:00:24.224 --> 00:00:26.126
and you have to make the
party favors for everybody.

00:00:26.126 --> 00:00:27.594
(panelists laugh)

00:00:27.594 --> 00:00:28.828
And I'm like, he's the
birthday kid, give him...

00:00:28.828 --> 00:00:30.196 align:start size:84% position:16%
and so now the party
favor is measles?

00:00:30.196 --> 00:00:31.431
(audience laughs)

00:00:31.431 --> 00:00:33.500
That's their version
of a plus-size model!

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:36.903 align:start size:97% position:3%
- I mean, that lady was
plus size from here to here.

00:00:36.903 --> 00:00:38.171
(audience and panelists laugh)

00:00:38.171 --> 00:00:42.442
I mean, the only thing
plus about her was here.

00:00:42.442 --> 00:00:44.044
- [Host] Is it odd that a
few weeks after you move

00:00:44.044 --> 00:00:45.645
into the neighborhood, Jon
Stewart decides he wants

00:00:45.645 --> 00:00:46.913
to move out?

00:00:46.913 --> 00:00:49.749
(audience laughs)

00:00:52.952 --> 00:00:55.622
I would say that yes, it is odd.

00:00:57.257 --> 00:00:59.592
I've said all along
that Jon is a racist.

00:00:59.592 --> 00:01:00.760
(audience laughs)

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:02.595 align:start size:84% position:16%

Just don't poke me. I

You can Candy Crush me.
