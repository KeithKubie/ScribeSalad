00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:15.450
The wrong things in our world are glamorous:
fast cars, tomato throwing

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:21.970
contests, actors - instead of the
right things: going to bed early, long walks

00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:27.419
observing the sky at dusk, kindness...
It’s not that nothing at all is glamorous,

00:00:27.419 --> 00:00:34.000
it's just that we need to direct our admiration
and excitement more wisely; we need to turn

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:38.309
it upon the things which genuinely deserve
prestige.

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:44.120
Artists can help us. One of the fundamental
things art can do for us is turn the spotlight

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:50.370
of glamour in the best – and most helpful
– directions. Artists identify things that

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:55.220
we tend to overlook but which, ideally, we
should care about deeply. And through the

00:00:55.240 --> 00:00:58.440
Serving women, bread, and milk were not

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:04.060
especially exciting in the late 1650s,
when Johannes Vermeer painted this picture. [The Milkmaid, 1657-8].

00:01:04.060 --> 00:01:08.460
She wasn’t a celebrity; he isn’t showing
us someone who was already highly admired.

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:13.810
Yet Vermeer saw in the serving woman pouring
milk something that he felt deserved prolonged

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:19.950
contemplation and admiration. He thought something
really important was going on. By worldly

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:26.770
standards, it’s a pretty humble situation.
But the care with which she works is moving.

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:33.420
Vermeer is impressed by the idea that our
true needs might be quite simple. Bread and

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:40.270
milk are really rather satisfying. The light
coming through the window is beautiful. A

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:43.850
plain white wall can be a major source of
delight.

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:49.609
Vermeer is redistributing glamour by raising
the prestige of the things he depicts. And

00:01:49.609 --> 00:01:55.119
he’s trying to get us to feel the same way.
The milk maid is a kind of propaganda (or

00:01:55.119 --> 00:01:57.609
an advert) for homely pleasures.

00:01:57.609 --> 00:02:00.759
Or consider the painstakingly skilful – and

00:02:00.759 --> 00:02:06.280
commercial – business of lace-making [The Lacemaker, 1669-1671]: Vermeer
paints the self-employed businesswoman with

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:11.660
the usual devotion and care that would be given to a military hero or a great political

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:14.920
leader.
Vermeer was himself unremarkable in many ways.

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:21.920
He was born in 1632 in the small but beautiful
city of Delft, where his father was a modestly

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:25.099
successful art dealer-cum-innkeeper.

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:29.040
He stayed there most of his life. He never
travelled away from Delft after his marriage

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:35.560
at age 20. He hardly even left his pleasant
home. He and his wife, Catharina, had 11

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:39.349
surviving children and he did much of his painting from the rooms on the upper

00:02:39.349 --> 00:02:40.250
floor.
(Modeled after Catharina:)

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:45.010
Vermeer was a slow painter, partially because
he was not only a painter. He continued the

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:51.180
family businesses of art dealing and innkeeping and he also became the head of the local guild of painters.

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:53.160
In contemporary terms, his career was not

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:57.830
a huge success. He wasn’t especially famous and he didn’t make a lot

00:02:57.830 --> 00:02:59.709
of money.
He was in fact an exemplary member of what

00:02:59.709 --> 00:03:04.690
was,in those days, a newly important kind
of person: the middle-class individual. Vermeer

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:09.989
was in his teens when Holland (or technically
the Seven Provinces) became an independent

00:03:09.989 --> 00:03:13.489
state – the first ‘bourgeois republic’
in the world.

00:03:13.489 --> 00:03:15.970
In contrast to the semi-feudal aristocratic

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:20.840
nations that surrounded it, Holland gave honour
and political power to people who were not

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:25.769
at the pinnacle of society: to merchants,
administrators, prosperous artisans and entrepreneurs.

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:28.730
It was the first country in the world to be

00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:33.200
recognisably modern.
In this era, a great insight of Christianity

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:38.370
– one which is easily detachable from
the surrounding theology – became increasingly

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:43.610
relevant: that everybody’s inner life is
important, even if on the outside they do

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:45.980
not seem particularly distinguished.

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:52.240
Vermeer paints 'The Girl with the Pearl Earring' with the same kind of consideration.

00:03:52.240 --> 00:03:55.580
[The Girl with the Pearl Earring, 1665]
She isn’t anybody famous or important

00:03:55.640 --> 00:03:58.580
She isn’t rich. The earring
that she wears is nice, but it is a minor

00:03:58.590 --> 00:04:02.659
trinket by the eye of the fashionable
world. It is the one pricey thing she

00:04:02.659 --> 00:04:09.469
owns. Yet she’s not in need of justice – she’s
not downtrodden or badly treated. She is (for

00:04:09.469 --> 00:04:15.450
want of a better term) ordinary. Yet,
she is (like everyone) not in the least

00:04:15.450 --> 00:04:22.440
ordinary: she is uniquely, profoundly, and mysteriously, herself.

00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:26.060
The picture which best sums up Vermeer’s

00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:30.500
philosophy, The Little Street, has become
one of the most famous works of art in the

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:36.389
world. It has pride of place in Amsterdam’s
great Rijksmuseum; it is insured for perhaps

00:04:36.389 --> 00:04:42.060
half a billion euros and is the subject of
a mountain of learned articles.

00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:46.199
Yet the painting is pointedly out of synch with its status. Because,

00:04:46.199 --> 00:04:52.330
above all else, it wants to show us that the
ordinary can be very special. The picture

00:04:52.330 --> 00:04:57.199
says that looking after a simple but beautiful
home, cleaning the yard, watching the children,

00:04:57.199 --> 00:05:03.030
darning cloth – and doing these things faithfully
and without despair – is life’s real duty.

00:05:03.030 --> 00:05:09.220
It is an anti-heroic picture: a weapon against
false images of glamour. It refuses to accept

00:05:09.220 --> 00:05:14.479
that true glamour depends on amazing feats
of courage or on the attainment of status.

00:05:14.480 --> 00:05:19.480
It argues that doing the modest things, that
are expected of all of us, is enough.

00:05:20.140 --> 00:05:26.020
Vermeer did not live long. He died in 1675,
still only in his early forties.

00:05:26.020 --> 00:05:31.370
But he had communicated a crucial – and
hugely sane – idea: much of what matters

00:05:31.370 --> 00:05:37.750
to us is not exciting, urgent, dramatic or
special things. Most of life is taken up dealing

00:05:37.750 --> 00:05:42.960
with things that are routine, modest, humble, and (to be honest) a touch dull.

00:05:42.960 --> 00:05:45.240
Our culture should focus on getting us to

00:05:45.240 --> 00:05:49.130
appreciate the average, the ordinary and the everyday.

00:05:49.130 --> 00:05:53.560
When Vermeer painted his hometown
he didn’t choose a special day; the sky

00:05:53.560 --> 00:05:55.990
is neither very overcast nor especially sunny.

00:05:55.990 --> 00:05:59.740
[View of Delft, 1660-1]
Nothing is happening. There are no celebrities around.

00:05:59.740 --> 00:06:05.470
Yet it is, as he has taught us to recognise,
all very special indeed.
