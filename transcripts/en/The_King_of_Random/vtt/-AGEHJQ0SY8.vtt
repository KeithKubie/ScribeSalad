00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:03.330
Hey guys welcome back, I'm Nate, thank you for joining me today on the king of random today

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:07.140
We're going to be trying an experiment suggested by pierios hi grant

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:10.830
Can you try and see what happens if you put cake mix in a vacuum and get the bubbles out?

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:16.440
How would the baked cake look well pierios? That sounds like a great experiment to us so today? We're gonna try it

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:18.390
We've picked up this bright blue cake mix

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:20.260
Which we're gonna mix up according to the instructions

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:24.809
Put in the vacuum chamber to suck out all the air and then bake it before we start mixing ingredients

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:26.810
Let's get the oven warming up

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:33.119
The instructions also tell us that we need to grease and flour our pan before we pour in the batter

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:45.570
The ovens heating up and our pans are ready for the cake batter, so let's start mixing our ingredients. It's blue blue cake mix

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:57.299
Taste blue, it doesn't it just taste the cake batter water

00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:04.949
All our ingredients are added now. Let's mix it

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:15.710
Vo tastes all mixed up

00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:20.640
It's like cake just

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:26.419
Very very moist cake probably shouldn't eat things with raw egg in them but just tastes so good something

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:29.660
I noticed while mixing this up is this cake better is actually fairly stiff

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:34.880
I hope you've seen our previous video where we tried using a vacuum chamber on pancake batter before cooking them

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:38.029
This is much thicker than pancake batter. You can see it's like

00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:41.389
Barely moving at all even when the bowl is turned completely sideways

00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:45.020
We'll see what kind of effect and change that has when it goes in the vacuum chamber

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:48.829
It might have a harder time bubbling than pancake batter does now

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:54.020
I'll divide this cake batter in to put half of it in our vacuum chamber and half of it in one of our prepared pans

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:58.009
That's great. It's just like this blue boozy blob down there

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:05.539
Half of the cake batter is in the jar let's pull out the air and see what happens

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:14.480
Holy cow

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:21.769
That's amazing that immediately starts swelling up like a balloon oh my gosh

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:26.990
Thought it was gonna be too thick

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:36.430
Holy cow that's so freaking awesome oh

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:47.410
That's a thousand times better than what I thought was gonna happen oh

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:54.369
We're coming back for a second run it filled up it collapsed now. It's filling back up again

00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:59.920
That's weird that almost looks like a baked cake already. Oh, it's alive

00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:06.640
It's a boiling roiling sea of cake batter. Yeah, we're definitely doing another one just cuz I want to get that again I

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:12.310
Had a few different thoughts of how this was gonna go firstly. I thought it was so stiff that it wasn't really gonna

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:12.790
Do too much

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:17.379
I thought maybe a couple bubbles would just slowly build up and pop and it would maybe just sort of look like a

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:19.869
Swamp or something like that this immediately

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:26.619
Started ballooning up like as soon as the pressure was changed inside the chamber it just started expanding this giant

00:03:26.990 --> 00:03:31.119
Blob of cake flavored foam and almost filled the whole chamber

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:37.300
So when I turn off the vacuum chamber and stop everything off it will actually start to grow back a little bit as well

00:03:37.519 --> 00:03:38.900
the cake mix

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:45.400
Probably has baking soda and baking powder in it and when those get wet they start combining to form carbon dioxide so this is probably

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:51.730
Creating its own gases, and then if I turn the vacuum back on. I think it will suck all that built-up co2 out

00:03:52.010 --> 00:03:58.539
Yeah, you pull it turn the vacuum back on and it starts pulling all that new gas back out it collapses back down all

00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:04.360
Right we've been pulling air out of this cake batter for several minutes now, and we've let it rise its collapsed

00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:09.639
It keeps bubbling a little bit, but one interesting thing is the whole tank is still at almost a vacuum pressure

00:04:09.709 --> 00:04:13.959
So we haven't tried letting off the pressure to see if the cake collapses even more when we do that

00:04:13.959 --> 00:04:15.959
So let's give that a try

00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:18.380
Oh

00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:21.090
Snap that turned

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:28.229
Dark-colored immediately, I think so much air has been pulled out that it's lost the light color given to it by the air

00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:36.569
Well just feels like cake batter, I don't know because it has no air in it

00:04:36.570 --> 00:04:43.140
It's it's like a lot slimy er  looking like it's it's not full of bubbles like a batter should be

00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:46.950
It's just like dense thick slimy

00:04:48.730 --> 00:04:55.259
Still tastes like cake batter shocking. Now, let's use the spatula to scrape this out pour it into our pan and bake it up

00:05:01.370 --> 00:05:07.699
I look at the difference in the color of the dude. This is our normal cake better, and this is our cake better

00:05:07.699 --> 00:05:09.699
That's been vacuumed. It's

00:05:09.990 --> 00:05:15.949
Like wildly different colors. That's what happens if you pull all the air out of this. Oh that is great

00:05:24.840 --> 00:05:28.549
Those cakes are looking good and while they're cooking in the oven we're going to start mixing up a new batch

00:05:28.550 --> 00:05:35.030
And we're gonna use those to make some poop emoji cupcakes using this mold from Rosanna pansino from the YouTube channel nerdy nummies

00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:46.719
Our cake timer went off, so let's use these bamboo skewers to test if our cakes are ready

00:05:48.020 --> 00:05:54.789
Those look very different from each other all right the skewer should come out clean if the cake is finished

00:05:56.560 --> 00:05:58.620
That's looking pretty good and clean now

00:05:58.940 --> 00:05:59.440
 

00:05:59.440 --> 00:06:04.300
I'm just gonna test what happened with the one that we vacuumed Shanker feels more like brownies and cake

00:06:05.720 --> 00:06:09.100
All right, I think that's finished they've both been in there for the same amount of time

00:06:09.480 --> 00:06:11.860
Let's take them out and start to let them cool down

00:06:14.140 --> 00:06:17.540
We have our second batch all mixed up, but there's one small change I want to do

00:06:17.559 --> 00:06:21.219
I want to use some yellow food coloring and try and turn this blue cake green

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:32.779
There we go, it's not the most intense green color in the world

00:06:32.780 --> 00:06:37.820
But it is greener than it was before and I'm interested to see how it changes when we decompress it in the vacuum chamber

00:06:38.070 --> 00:06:42.379
First let's fill three of these cupcake molds with non vacuumed cake batter

00:06:49.820 --> 00:06:52.840
The batter is in the jar let's turn on the Machine and suck out the air

00:07:05.240 --> 00:07:06.400
woah

00:07:12.640 --> 00:07:14.940
Well that's even more than last time and

00:07:15.550 --> 00:07:18.449
It's collapsing ah I collapse collapse oh

00:07:19.030 --> 00:07:21.030
that is great I

00:07:21.100 --> 00:07:27.629
Love watching that I'm gonna try cycling some pressure in and closing it off again to see if that speeds up the process Oh

00:07:29.229 --> 00:07:35.939
Too fast too fast I got splattered everywhere the air rushing in through the valve

00:07:37.210 --> 00:07:40.889
Hit the cake batter and splattered it a little bit didn't mean to go that quickly

00:07:43.210 --> 00:07:50.820
There you go decompressed slightly green cake batter, let's scoop a little bit of that out and put it into our cupcake mold

00:07:53.800 --> 00:07:58.770
On one of these I'm gonna try filling it up all the way because our first cake didn't really seem to rise much

00:07:58.770 --> 00:08:03.389
So I'm not too worried about it expanding out of the mold now. Let's throw these in the oven

00:08:11.879 --> 00:08:13.259
All right

00:08:13.259 --> 00:08:18.408
That's a thing. We've got our normal cake and we've got our cake that was made with the vacuum decompressed batter

00:08:18.409 --> 00:08:20.449
Let's cut them open and see how they turned out

00:08:23.190 --> 00:08:30.499
One feels pretty normal nice and light and fluffy cuts easily on a concave plate, which is not the best surface for it

00:08:30.500 --> 00:08:31.490
It's collapsing a little bit

00:08:31.490 --> 00:08:37.279
But that's just because of the shape of the plate not the cake itself very soft very airy all right

00:08:37.279 --> 00:08:40.129
Let's try cutting open the cake made from our vacuumed batter

00:08:42.270 --> 00:08:46.789
Still cuts pretty easily I think it does feel a little bit more dense not terribly bad

00:08:47.339 --> 00:08:50.898
Wow that almost looks like gelatin more than it looks like cake

00:08:51.300 --> 00:08:56.359
We have less than half of the height of the normal cake it's really squished down

00:08:56.579 --> 00:09:01.519
Let's test out our dense cake I'm just gonna be a monster and cut a piece right out of the middle here goes

00:09:03.779 --> 00:09:07.699
It's not bad, but if I took a bite of that not knowing ahead of time what it was

00:09:07.700 --> 00:09:10.309
I'm not sure if I would guess that it was cake it's

00:09:11.310 --> 00:09:13.310
It's obviously a dessert. It's sweet

00:09:13.529 --> 00:09:15.200
It's got a cake flavor to it

00:09:15.200 --> 00:09:20.959
but the texture is so different that it does it just doesn't feel like cake it feels like maybe some liquid has been added to

00:09:20.959 --> 00:09:24.739
It or. It's some sort of gelatin base, but yeah very different

00:09:25.860 --> 00:09:28.070
When I squish the fluffy cake they start to look the same

00:09:30.820 --> 00:09:36.479
You kind of see tiny bits of liquid coming out of this cake at some point I'm wondering if it's just butter or

00:09:37.330 --> 00:09:42.719
Water got trapped because there was no air bubbles anymore and a good way to make a mess though

00:09:45.520 --> 00:09:48.839
Timer says our cupcakes are ready. Let's give one a test that

00:09:52.120 --> 00:09:58.770
Came out nice and clean say we're ready to go, let's try D molding our poop emoji cupcakes and see how they turned out

00:10:03.910 --> 00:10:08.880
Well that's a little bit of a poop emoji shape these actually come out more easily

00:10:09.490 --> 00:10:12.299
That should be about the same amount of cupcake batter

00:10:12.460 --> 00:10:16.919
You can see that pulling all the air out of it and the vacuum chamber really made a difference in how it turned out

00:10:17.220 --> 00:10:20.660
And kind of afraid to D mold this one cuz I think it's still kind of liquid on the inside

00:10:20.660 --> 00:10:22.660
But we'll see what happens

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:26.740
oh There we go

00:10:26.740 --> 00:10:30.840
You know that probably has the best poop shape of all of them, but it is

00:10:31.960 --> 00:10:35.069
Leaking liquid cake batter. I'm gonna squish it

00:10:40.790 --> 00:10:45.159
Green cupcake poop your poop looks like this see a doctor immediately

00:10:48.560 --> 00:10:53.919
He's interesting little tunnels and that's where the air was trying to rise up out

00:10:54.950 --> 00:11:00.790
There you have it cake batter run through a vacuum chamber and then baked you don't get a very light or fluffy cake it's still

00:11:00.790 --> 00:11:06.130
A dessert it's still edible some people may even prefer it that way I like the light fluffy cake that doesn't have the concentrated egg

00:11:06.130 --> 00:11:11.120
Taste and all around I think it's a better idea if you don't include the vacuum chamber as part of your cake baking process

00:11:11.720 --> 00:11:18.180
especially, thank you to Rosana from nerdy nummies for providing these poop emoji cupcake molds and a special shout-out to PIeRios for

that looks really delicious, I kind of wish I could eat it while it was in a vacuum

00:11:41.600 --> 00:11:44.740
Foaming up like a foam cake balloon.

00:11:47.380 --> 00:11:49.980
oh My gosh it tastes toke, no I'm kidding it tastes exactly the same

00:11:50.660 --> 00:11:52.220
just cake
