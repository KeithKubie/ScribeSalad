00:00:01.568 --> 00:00:03.070
- I MEAN, THIS IS RIDICULOUS.

00:00:03.070 --> 00:00:05.072
DID YOU HAVE A HOLE IN THAT,
OR WHAT HAPPENED?

00:00:05.072 --> 00:00:06.473
- I'M GONNA CLEAN THAT UP.

00:00:06.473 --> 00:00:08.375
- LIKE, REALLY?
- I DIDN'T DO THAT.

00:00:08.375 --> 00:00:10.377
- YOU KNOW THIS IS
MY GODDAMN HOME, RIGHT?

00:00:10.377 --> 00:00:12.746
- YOU LIVE
IN THIS [bleep]HOLE?

00:00:12.746 --> 00:00:14.314
- HELLO.

00:00:14.314 --> 00:00:18.318
TODAY WE'RE GONNA TALK TO YOU
ABOUT THE ELECTION OF 1800.

00:00:20.053 --> 00:00:21.889
[slurps, laughs]

00:00:21.889 --> 00:00:23.423
THOMAS JEFFERSON
AND JOHN ADAMS--

00:00:23.423 --> 00:00:25.525
THEY WERE FOUNDING
FATHERS OF AMERICA.

00:00:25.525 --> 00:00:27.494
THEY WERE ALSO
THE BEST OF FRIENDS.

00:00:27.494 --> 00:00:29.496
ADAMS WAS LIKE,
THE CONSTITUTION--

00:00:29.496 --> 00:00:32.165
YOU CAN KIND OF BEND THAT
HOW YOU NEED TO BEND IT.

00:00:32.165 --> 00:00:33.634
WE CAN KIND OF WORK
WITH THIS,

00:00:33.634 --> 00:00:35.035
AND JEFFERSON
WAS ALWAYS LIKE,

00:00:35.035 --> 00:00:36.570
CONSTITUTION IS
THE CONSTITUTION.

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:37.971
YOU CAN'T [bleep] WITH THAT.

00:00:37.971 --> 00:00:39.573
BUT THEY LOVED EACH OTHER...

00:00:39.573 --> 00:00:41.775
UNTIL ADAMS BECAME PRESIDENT,

00:00:41.775 --> 00:00:44.211
AND IMMEDIATELY
THEY STARTED BUTTING HEADS.

00:00:44.211 --> 00:00:47.881
JOHN ADAMS WAS LIKE,
IT'S ILLEGAL TO TALK ANY [bleep]

00:00:47.881 --> 00:00:49.583
ABOUT THE PRESIDENT
OF THE UNITED STATES,

00:00:49.583 --> 00:00:52.152
AND IF YOU DISAGREE
WITH THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT,

00:00:52.152 --> 00:00:53.353
[bleep] YOU.

00:00:53.353 --> 00:00:55.656
AND JEFFERSON WAS LIKE,
WELL, THIS IS TYRANNY.

00:00:55.656 --> 00:00:58.458
THAT'S A VIOLATION
OF A LITTLE SOMETHING CALLED

00:00:58.458 --> 00:00:59.793
FREEDOM OF SPEECH.

00:00:59.793 --> 00:01:03.063
IT ALL REALLY REACHES ITS HEAD
ON THE ELECTION OF 1800,

00:01:03.063 --> 00:01:06.033
WHERE THESE TWO LIFELONG FRIENDS
WERE PITTED AGAINST EACH OTHER.

00:01:06.033 --> 00:01:09.369
ADAMS IS LIKE,
IF YOU ELECT THOMAS JEFFERSON,

00:01:09.369 --> 00:01:10.737
HERE'S WHAT YOU'RE GONNA GET.

00:01:10.737 --> 00:01:12.372
MURDER ALL THE TIME.

00:01:12.372 --> 00:01:14.241
EVERYBODY'S GONNA BE
MURDERING EACH OTHER.

00:01:14.241 --> 00:01:17.945
INCEST, YOUR WIVES WILL LOSE
THEIR VIRTUE HAVING SEX

00:01:17.945 --> 00:01:19.947
WITH A LOT OF DUDES
WILLY-NILLY.

00:01:19.947 --> 00:01:22.049
SO JEFFERSON STARTS
TALKING A LOT OF [bleep]

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:23.483
ABOUT JOHN ADAMS.

00:01:23.483 --> 00:01:24.885
WE'RE TALKING
ABOUT GUYS WHO, LIKE,

00:01:24.885 --> 00:01:26.219
CREATED THIS COUNTRY.

00:01:26.219 --> 00:01:28.789
THEY WERE REALLY LIKE
A BUNCH OF EIGHTH GRADERS.

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:29.990
HE WAS LIKE, YOU KNOW WHAT?

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:33.393
ADAMS HAS PROSTITUTES
SHIPPED IN FROM OVERSEAS

00:01:33.393 --> 00:01:35.128
THAT HE BANGS ALL THE TIME.

00:01:35.128 --> 00:01:37.497
I'M JUST GONNA--I'M JUST
GONNA TELL YOU THAT RIGHT NOW.

00:01:37.497 --> 00:01:40.367
I-I FEEL LIKE I KEEP SEEING
SPIT FLYING FROM MY MOUTH.

00:01:40.367 --> 00:01:42.402
- NO, I'M FEELING IT.
- AM I SPITTING A LOT?

00:01:42.402 --> 00:01:43.737
- YEAH, I'M GLAD
YOU'RE SEEING IT, YEAH.

00:01:43.737 --> 00:01:45.439
- THAT'S GOOD.
- I'M IN THE SPLASH ZONE.

00:01:45.439 --> 00:01:48.475
- SO JEFFERSON
WENT TO THE NEWSPAPERS.

00:01:48.475 --> 00:01:51.044
HE SAYS,
I WANT TO TELL YOU THIS--

00:01:51.044 --> 00:01:53.814
JOHN ADAMS
IS A HERMAPHRODITE.

00:01:53.814 --> 00:01:56.483
HE'S GOT BOTH MAN
AND WOMAN SEX ORGANS.

00:01:56.483 --> 00:01:58.318
THIS IS, LIKE,
A PUBLISHED STATEMENT

00:01:58.318 --> 00:01:59.553
FROM THOMAS JEFFERSON.

00:01:59.553 --> 00:02:01.555
ADAMS WAS LIKE, OKAY, FINE.

00:02:01.555 --> 00:02:03.023
YOU WANT TO GO THAT ROUTE?

00:02:03.023 --> 00:02:05.258
THAT'S WHEN [bleep]
GOT REALLY DIRTY.

00:02:05.258 --> 00:02:08.061
ADAMS SAYS, OH, BY THE WAY,
IF YOU WERE THINKING

00:02:08.061 --> 00:02:13.200
ABOUT VOTING FOR JEFFERSON,
YOU SHOULDN'T BECAUSE HE'S DEAD.

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:15.369
- THAT'S A PRETTY GOOD CAMPAIGN.
- IT'S A VERY GOOD CAMPAIGN.

00:02:15.369 --> 00:02:16.403
- VOTE FOR ME.
I'M ALIVE.

00:02:16.403 --> 00:02:17.571
- YEAH.

00:02:17.571 --> 00:02:18.972
EVEN IF YOU DISAGREE
WITH EVERYTHING I SAY,

00:02:18.972 --> 00:02:20.440
AT THE VERY LEAST, I'M ALIVE.

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:22.309
- WOULD YOU RATHER BE ACCUSED
OF HAVING

00:02:22.309 --> 00:02:24.678
A PENIS AND A VAGINA
OR BEING DEAD?

00:02:24.678 --> 00:02:26.446
- I THINK BEING ALIVE
WITH A PENIS AND A VAGINA

00:02:26.446 --> 00:02:28.482
WOULD BE AN AMAZING EXPERIENCE.

00:02:28.482 --> 00:02:30.784
AND YOU'RE ALIVE.
- [laughs]

00:02:30.784 --> 00:02:32.719
- JEFFERSON CALLS
UPON A HATCHET MAN,

00:02:32.719 --> 00:02:37.657
JAMES CALLENDER, TO PUBLISH
NEWSPAPER ARTICLES ABOUT ADAMS.

00:02:37.657 --> 00:02:40.694
ADAMS...

00:02:40.694 --> 00:02:42.629
WHAT WAS I GONNA SAY?

00:02:42.629 --> 00:02:44.731
OH, YEAH, AND HE WAS GONNA GO
TO WAR WITH THE FRENCH.

00:02:44.731 --> 00:02:46.233
THAT'S WHAT WAS PUBLISHED
IN THE NEWSPAPER.

00:02:46.233 --> 00:02:47.768
AND IT'S A LIE.
IT'S NOT TRUE AT ALL.

00:02:47.768 --> 00:02:48.969
AMERICA WAS LIKE,

00:02:48.969 --> 00:02:50.404
I DON'T WANT TO GO TO WAR
WITH THE FRENCH.

00:02:50.404 --> 00:02:51.705
THAT SOUNDS TERRIBLE.

00:02:51.705 --> 00:02:53.640
AND THEY ELECT JEFFERSON
INTO OFFICE.

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:54.975
JEFFERSON WINS.

00:02:54.975 --> 00:02:57.878
ADAMS IS LIKE, YOU WANT TO GO
WITH THIS LOSER, FINE.

00:02:57.878 --> 00:03:02.749
BUT BEFORE I LEAVE, I'M GOING
TO APPOINT ALL OF THESE PEOPLE

00:03:02.749 --> 00:03:06.319
WHO VIOLENTLY OPPOSE EVERYTHING
JEFFERSON STANDS FOR,

00:03:06.319 --> 00:03:10.390
AND THEN HE'S LIKE, I HOPE YOU
LIKE ALL THESE ASS[bleep].

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:13.193
SO CUT TO FOUR YEARS
DOWN THE LINE,

00:03:13.193 --> 00:03:16.129
AND JEFFERSON'S DAUGHTER DIES,
AND ABIGAIL ADAMS IS LIKE,

00:03:16.129 --> 00:03:19.566
LOOK, I KNOW WE'VE HAD OUR
DIFFERENCES WITH JEFFERSON,

00:03:19.566 --> 00:03:21.334
BUT I SHOULD POP HIM OFF
A LETTER.

00:03:21.334 --> 00:03:24.004
SHE'S LIKE, LOOK,
I'M REALLY, REALLY SORRY

00:03:24.004 --> 00:03:27.841
ABOUT YOUR DAUGHTER,
AND IT SUCKS THAT SHE IS DEAD.

00:03:27.841 --> 00:03:30.077
JEFFERSON GETS THIS LETTER,
AND HE'S LIKE,

00:03:30.077 --> 00:03:33.914
I-I WANT TO THANK YOU SO MUCH
FOR BEING SO CONSIDERATE

00:03:33.914 --> 00:03:35.649
ABOUT THE DEATH OF MY DAUGHTER.

00:03:35.649 --> 00:03:37.384
BUT WHILE
I'VE GOT YOUR ATTENTION,

00:03:37.384 --> 00:03:40.821
I ALSO WANT TO TELL YOU,
[bleep] YOU,

00:03:40.821 --> 00:03:43.190
AND [bleep] YOUR HUSBAND
FOR BEING SUCH ASS[bleep]

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:44.691
WHO [bleep] UP MY PRESIDENCY.

00:03:44.691 --> 00:03:45.826
THIS IS HOW IMMATURE

00:03:45.826 --> 00:03:48.895
THESE GREAT MEN
OF AMERICAN HISTORY WERE.

00:03:48.895 --> 00:03:50.464
HE CAN'T EVEN,
LIKE, JUST--

00:03:50.464 --> 00:03:52.699
LIKE, THAT SHOULD HAVE BEEN
TWO SEPARATE LETTERS.

00:03:52.699 --> 00:03:54.801
SHE'S LIKE,
JOHN, YOU KNOW WHAT?

00:03:54.801 --> 00:03:57.270
WE'RE DONE
WITH THOMAS JEFFERSON.

00:03:57.270 --> 00:03:58.338
HE'S AN ASS[bleep].

00:03:58.338 --> 00:04:00.107
I TRIED TO MAKE IT WORK
WITH THIS GUY,

00:04:00.107 --> 00:04:03.076
BUT [bleep] HIM.

00:04:03.076 --> 00:04:06.913
SO THESE TWO DON'T SPEAK
FOR A DECADE.

00:04:06.913 --> 00:04:09.549
EVENTUALLY, BENJAMIN RUSH,

00:04:09.549 --> 00:04:11.518
WHO WAS ANOTHER FOUNDING FATHER,
WAS LIKE,

00:04:11.518 --> 00:04:15.355
LOOK, JOHN ADAMS.
JOHNNY, I LOVE YOU TWO GUYS.

00:04:15.355 --> 00:04:16.823
WHY AREN'T YOU SPEAKING ANYMORE?

00:04:16.823 --> 00:04:19.059
WHY CAN'T WE ALL BE FRIENDS
LIKE WE USED TO BACK

00:04:19.059 --> 00:04:21.061
IN THOSE GLORY DAYS,

00:04:21.061 --> 00:04:24.264
THOSE 1776 DAYS
THAT WERE SO MAGICAL?

00:04:24.264 --> 00:04:27.434
AND JOHN ADAMS WAS LIKE,
LOOK, I LOVE TOMMY JEFFS.

00:04:27.434 --> 00:04:29.002
I'M A BIG FAN.

00:04:29.002 --> 00:04:30.504
I'LL POP HIM OFF A LETTER.

00:04:30.504 --> 00:04:31.571
IT'S VERY GENERAL.

00:04:31.571 --> 00:04:33.173
IT'S LIKE,
HEY, HOW YOU DOING?

00:04:33.173 --> 00:04:34.708
I-I MISS YOU.

00:04:34.708 --> 00:04:35.942
I HOPE YOU'RE ALL RIGHT.

00:04:35.942 --> 00:04:37.511
HOW'S THINGS GOING?

00:04:37.511 --> 00:04:38.545
JEFFERSON GETS THE LETTER.

00:04:38.545 --> 00:04:41.181
HE'S LIKE, ADAMS, JOHNNY ADS.

00:04:41.181 --> 00:04:42.349
GOOD TO HEAR FROM YOU, BUDDY.

00:04:42.349 --> 00:04:44.117
IT'S BEEN TEN YEARS.
HOW'S LIFE?

00:04:44.117 --> 00:04:45.752
AND THEN
THE LETTERS START FLOWING,

00:04:45.752 --> 00:04:48.088
AND BEFORE YOU KNOW IT,
THEY START TO CONNECT

00:04:48.088 --> 00:04:49.089
ON CERTAIN THINGS.

00:04:49.089 --> 00:04:50.223
THEY START TO CONNECT ON,

00:04:50.223 --> 00:04:51.792
I'M A LITTLE CONCERNED
ABOUT SLAVERY.

00:04:51.792 --> 00:04:54.528
THOMAS JEFFERSON WAS LIKE,
I'M ANTI-SLAVERY,

00:04:54.528 --> 00:04:57.964
BUT I DO HAVE
HUNDREDS OF SLAVES.

00:04:57.964 --> 00:05:00.133
UH...

00:05:00.133 --> 00:05:02.502
UH...

00:05:02.502 --> 00:05:04.337
WHAT AM I TALKING ABOUT?

00:05:04.337 --> 00:05:06.106
- KEEP GOING.
YOU GOT IT.

00:05:06.106 --> 00:05:08.942
- IT'S WEIRD HOW QUICKLY
ALCOHOL MAKES YOU NOT REALIZE

00:05:08.942 --> 00:05:12.179
WHAT YOU SAID AT ALL.
[laughs]

00:05:12.179 --> 00:05:14.080
SO, BY THE END OF THEIR LIFE,

00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:17.918
THESE TWO HAVE EXCHANGED
158 LETTERS,

00:05:17.918 --> 00:05:20.587
AND THEY'RE BEST FRIENDS AGAIN.

00:05:20.587 --> 00:05:22.455
THEN IT'S 1826.

00:05:22.455 --> 00:05:24.357
JOHN ADAMS IS ON HIS DEATHBED,

00:05:24.357 --> 00:05:27.294
AND HIS LAST WORDS ARE,
INDEPENDENCE FOREVER,

00:05:27.294 --> 00:05:30.997
AND ALSO,
THOMAS JEFFERSON SURVIVES

00:05:30.997 --> 00:05:33.433
BECAUSE THAT GUY'S
[bleep] AWESOME.

00:05:33.433 --> 00:05:36.636
LITTLE DID HE KNOW
THAT JUST A FEW HOURS PRIOR,

00:05:36.636 --> 00:05:41.575
MILES AND MILES AWAY,
THOMAS JEFFERSON HAD ALSO DIED.

00:05:41.575 --> 00:05:46.546
THAT DAY WAS JULY 4TH,
THE 50TH ANNIVERSARY

00:05:46.546 --> 00:05:49.983
OF THE SIGNING OF
THE DECLARATION OF INDEPENDENCE,

00:05:49.983 --> 00:05:51.451
WHICH IS CRAZY.

00:05:51.451 --> 00:05:53.353
- THAT'S TRUE FRIENDSHIP.

00:05:53.353 --> 00:05:55.322
- TRUE FRIENDSHIP.
- CHEERS.

00:05:55.322 --> 00:05:56.456
TO FRIENDSHIP.

00:05:56.456 --> 00:05:58.358
YOU'RE MY BEST FRIEND.

00:05:58.358 --> 00:06:00.393
- WE BARELY KNOW EACH OTHER.

00:06:00.393 --> 00:06:02.495
- NO, WE'RE BEST FRIENDS.
