PRESENTER: Hi, everybody.

00:00:02.029 --> 00:00:03.500
And thank you for joining
us today.

00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:05.660
We've got a great Google Talk
coming up and I have the

00:00:05.660 --> 00:00:08.830
pleasure of introducing our
speaker, Paddy Hirsch.

00:00:08.830 --> 00:00:11.660
Paddy is a senior producer at
the American Public Media's

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:14.920
business radio program
Marketplace and is also the

00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:17.950
creator of the acclaimed
Marketplace Whiteboard.

00:00:17.950 --> 00:00:20.540
His recently published book
Man Versus Markets--

00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:23.450
Economics Explained Plain
and Simple, focuses on

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:26.650
demystifying markets and using
stories to explain economic

00:00:26.650 --> 00:00:28.230
terms and principles.

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:31.350
He then relates these stories
back to real life examples,

00:00:31.350 --> 00:00:33.980
such as the mortgage crisis
of several years back.

00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:36.170
But I'll let Paddy
explain more.

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:38.880
Please join me in giving a warm
and Googley welcome to

00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:40.130
Paddy Hirsch.

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:45.360
PADDY HIRSCH: Thank
you very much.

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:46.880
Thank you.

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:48.150
It's a pleasure to be here.

00:00:48.150 --> 00:00:48.990
Thank you for having me.

00:00:48.990 --> 00:00:50.460
Thank you for feeding me.

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:52.410
I've been up here before a
couple of times and I always

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:55.130
forget how good the food is, so
it was a real treat today.

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:56.570
Thanks for that.

00:00:56.570 --> 00:00:59.570
So usually when people ask me
to speak, they're usually

00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:01.730
very, very specific about
what they want.

00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:04.440
It's usually things like, can
you explain monetary policy

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:05.120
and inflation?

00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:06.460
Can you talk to me about
the Volcker rule?

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:07.410
Whatever it is.

00:01:07.410 --> 00:01:12.260
So I asked, what is it you'd
like me to speak about today?

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:16.200
And the answer that came back
through my publicist was, just

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:17.240
something about technology.

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:18.690
So I thought, OK.

00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:21.530
Well, those of you who've read
the book will know that I

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:24.130
actually talk a little bit about
high-frequency trading

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:26.380
in Man Versus Markets.

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:28.020
And so I thought, well,
I could talk about

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:29.730
high-frequency trading.

00:01:29.730 --> 00:01:31.110
And then I thought a little bit
about that and I thought,

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:32.360
hang on a second.

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:34.040
That's all about algorithms.

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:37.410
And you guys are kind of
the kings and queens of

00:01:37.410 --> 00:01:39.430
algorithms, so there's something
of a risk coming

00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:41.860
here and talking to you about
algorithms, right?

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:43.955
It's kind of like me going to
St. Peter and talking to him

00:01:43.955 --> 00:01:45.390
about gate security.

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:47.240
So Peter, I think you need
a few dogs over here.

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:49.490
And maybe you need one of those
fingerprint readers.

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:51.500
Get out of here.

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:53.780
So I won't talk about that.

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:54.980
Well, I might talk about
that a little later if

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:55.580
you'd like me to.

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:58.940
But let's talk about something
else that Google really does

00:01:58.940 --> 00:02:02.160
specialize in, which is in
identifying and meeting a

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:07.680
need, which is really what Man
Versus Markets is born from.

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:09.600
And could I see a show of
hands, how many people

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:10.734
actually know Marketplace?

00:02:10.734 --> 00:02:12.470
The radio show?

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:13.840
OK, that's great.

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:16.170
Do people know the whiteboards,
the video

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:18.015
products that we put
out on the web?

00:02:18.015 --> 00:02:19.666
Any takers there?

00:02:19.666 --> 00:02:22.530
OK, we kind of need some
more outreach there.

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:24.130
So what happened was--

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:25.250
Marketplace has been
in existence for

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:26.230
quite a long time now.

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:28.540
And we've been doing a great
job, I think, over the last

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:32.260
15, 20 years of actually taking
business news and

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:35.480
breaking it down and delivering
it in a way that

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:37.330
most people can understand--
like regular people can

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:39.175
understand, rather than
people on Wall Street.

00:02:39.175 --> 00:02:41.560
And that's really the
battle, is to--

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:43.410
we saw a need back then.

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:46.220
We saw people were reading the
business pages that come out

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:48.240
of the Wall Street Journal or
the back page of the New York

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:52.510
Times or listening to business
commercial radio and saying,

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:54.940
we don't understand what you
guys are talking about.

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:56.560
We don't understand
this language.

00:02:56.560 --> 00:02:59.100
So Marketplace was really
invented to meet that need.

00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:01.540
To meet the need of regular
people to understand what was

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:03.800
going on in Wall Street, what
was going on in business, so

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:06.180
that they could relate that
to their own lives.

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:10.510
So we then said, well, how
can we improve on that?

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:11.950
And really, we couldn't
really see that many

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:12.670
ways of doing it.

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:15.820
We were really the only people
on the landscape of radio and

00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:17.502
television in general
that were doing it.

00:03:17.502 --> 00:03:19.280
You had the niche programs like
CNBC, which is already

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:20.590
delivering to a certain
audience.

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:23.610
And it was us, which was
delivering to people like you

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:25.130
and I.

00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:28.070
Come the financial crisis, we
realized that there was a gap.

00:03:28.070 --> 00:03:30.640
So the financial crisis hit--
already before the financial

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:32.800
crisis, whenever Bear Stearns
started to collapse and we had

00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:35.110
this terrible credit crunch that
was really gripping the

00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:36.860
economy really badly.

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:41.190
And we realized that even though
we were breaking terms

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:43.160
down, or breaking the language
of Wall Street down, to a

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:45.110
certain extent, we weren't break
it down all the way.

00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:48.090
Because suddenly, terms would
just sort of pop out of the

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:51.830
back end of Wall Street like
CDOs, credit default swaps,

00:03:51.830 --> 00:03:55.140
collateralized debt obligations,
securitization.

00:03:55.140 --> 00:03:58.960
And we started to realize the we
were using that language in

00:03:58.960 --> 00:04:01.750
our own programming, because it
was really, really hard to

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:04.070
find a way to break down
those concepts.

00:04:04.070 --> 00:04:06.780
They were so dense and so
complicated, we couldn't find

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:08.190
a way to break it down.

00:04:08.190 --> 00:04:10.450
So I happened to come
from Wall Street.

00:04:10.450 --> 00:04:12.665
I used to work at an
organization called Standard

00:04:12.665 --> 00:04:13.380
and Poor's.

00:04:13.380 --> 00:04:16.630
I used to work for a division
of them that was like that

00:04:16.630 --> 00:04:18.180
little news division
they had reporting

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:18.990
on corporate finance.

00:04:18.990 --> 00:04:21.290
And I happened to work
in securitization.

00:04:21.290 --> 00:04:23.400
I covered that for many years.

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:25.620
So somebody asked, Paddy,
can you explain

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:26.900
how this stuff works?

00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:29.500
So I used an analogy that I
used when I was training

00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:32.240
people for Standard and Poor's,
which was to talk

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:37.430
about a cascade of glasses
at a wedding.

00:04:37.430 --> 00:04:39.650
Even if you haven't been to a
wedding where they have the

00:04:39.650 --> 00:04:42.580
glasses all stacked up on
themselves where you can pour

00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:44.030
champagne in the top,
you've probably

00:04:44.030 --> 00:04:45.480
seen it in mafia movies.

00:04:45.480 --> 00:04:46.095
They have it there.

00:04:46.095 --> 00:04:47.700
You pour in the champagne
on the top and it

00:04:47.700 --> 00:04:49.140
all cascades through.

00:04:49.140 --> 00:04:52.210
So I used this as a way to
explain how a securitization

00:04:52.210 --> 00:04:54.380
instrument worked, how one
of these CDOs worked.

00:04:54.380 --> 00:04:58.060
Somebody took a photograph or
took a video on one of the

00:04:58.060 --> 00:05:00.490
really basic camera phones
that they had then.

00:05:00.490 --> 00:05:03.500
And we slung it up onto the
web and we had hundreds of

00:05:03.500 --> 00:05:04.795
thousands of hits almost
instantaneously.

00:05:04.795 --> 00:05:06.130
It was amazing.

00:05:06.130 --> 00:05:10.220
So clearly we saw there was a
real thirst for knowing what

00:05:10.220 --> 00:05:12.350
these very exotic instruments
were.

00:05:12.350 --> 00:05:15.260
And we thought, this is really
strange, because who really

00:05:15.260 --> 00:05:17.190
wants to know what a CDO is.

00:05:17.190 --> 00:05:19.340
Really, nobody wants
to know that.

00:05:19.340 --> 00:05:21.440
Until it's crashing your
economy, in which case

00:05:21.440 --> 00:05:22.470
everybody wants to know it.

00:05:22.470 --> 00:05:27.350
So we realized that there was so
many of these very strange,

00:05:27.350 --> 00:05:29.300
new-fangled financial
concepts--

00:05:29.300 --> 00:05:30.660
and they were relatively new,
because they'd only been

00:05:30.660 --> 00:05:32.140
around for about 10 years--

00:05:32.140 --> 00:05:34.600
that were intricately bound into
the financial system, so

00:05:34.600 --> 00:05:36.960
tightly that when whenever
they started to fail, the

00:05:36.960 --> 00:05:38.180
whole system started
to go down.

00:05:38.180 --> 00:05:41.530
So we realized, wow, we've got
to do more than just explain

00:05:41.530 --> 00:05:42.860
the ins and outs
of Wall Street.

00:05:42.860 --> 00:05:46.900
We've got to explain how these
financial instruments work.

00:05:46.900 --> 00:05:49.620
So it was a really revelatory
thing for us.

00:05:49.620 --> 00:05:51.750
And it was a revelatory thing
for me, because then we

00:05:51.750 --> 00:05:53.920
started to tackle-- and I'd
encourage you go and look at

00:05:53.920 --> 00:05:54.890
the whiteboards.

00:05:54.890 --> 00:05:58.370
These are short videos, single
take, anything between three

00:05:58.370 --> 00:06:00.580
and eight minutes, that break
down all of these concepts.

00:06:00.580 --> 00:06:02.070
It's really worth having
a look at.

00:06:02.070 --> 00:06:04.010
And you can comment on the
bottom and tell me how bad

00:06:04.010 --> 00:06:05.870
they are and I'll redo them.

00:06:05.870 --> 00:06:09.190
But understanding that need for
explanatory journalism was

00:06:09.190 --> 00:06:11.660
really, really key for us.

00:06:11.660 --> 00:06:15.990
As you are doing all the time,
we did outreach with our

00:06:15.990 --> 00:06:18.790
listeners, outreach to the
consumers, we identified a

00:06:18.790 --> 00:06:20.720
need, we saw there was a
problem, and then we found a

00:06:20.720 --> 00:06:21.930
way to meet that need.

00:06:21.930 --> 00:06:24.410
And that's not something,
frankly, that Public Radio,

00:06:24.410 --> 00:06:27.700
and in fact, radio in general,
does that well.

00:06:27.700 --> 00:06:30.670
So it was good for us to be at
the front end of that kind of

00:06:30.670 --> 00:06:32.800
innovation.

00:06:32.800 --> 00:06:35.250
But as we were doing this, and I
was going around and talking

00:06:35.250 --> 00:06:37.600
to people, and we were meeting
people and talking about the

00:06:37.600 --> 00:06:40.490
product and how Public Radio was
doing things, we realized

00:06:40.490 --> 00:06:42.860
that there was actually an even
deeper need than wanting

00:06:42.860 --> 00:06:46.890
to know the ins and outs
of these instruments.

00:06:46.890 --> 00:06:49.940
We realized that there's
actually a really basic lack

00:06:49.940 --> 00:06:53.210
of understanding about even
the most simple financial

00:06:53.210 --> 00:06:54.640
instruments.

00:06:54.640 --> 00:06:56.070
And it turned out that people
would say to us--

00:06:56.070 --> 00:06:59.460
we'd go to meetings and we'd
expect people to say, can you

00:06:59.460 --> 00:07:02.530
explain again how this credit
default swap works, or how

00:07:02.530 --> 00:07:03.410
futures work?

00:07:03.410 --> 00:07:04.820
The really complicated stuff.

00:07:04.820 --> 00:07:06.580
People would say, you
know, I really don't

00:07:06.580 --> 00:07:08.300
get how a bond works.

00:07:08.300 --> 00:07:10.320
What's the difference between
a bond and a debt?

00:07:10.320 --> 00:07:13.190
We'd be like, well, there
is no differences.

00:07:13.190 --> 00:07:15.270
There's the same.

00:07:15.270 --> 00:07:16.360
People would say, what's
the difference

00:07:16.360 --> 00:07:17.850
between stock and equity?

00:07:17.850 --> 00:07:19.710
We were like, well, there
is no difference.

00:07:19.710 --> 00:07:20.210
They're the same.

00:07:20.210 --> 00:07:22.960
And suddenly we realized that
the whole lexicon of Wall

00:07:22.960 --> 00:07:26.010
Street has become so
complicated, and it's treated

00:07:26.010 --> 00:07:29.040
like such a black art, that it's
become impenetrable that

00:07:29.040 --> 00:07:31.880
even the most basic things that
those of us who've been

00:07:31.880 --> 00:07:33.800
in financial journalism for a
while, that have worked on

00:07:33.800 --> 00:07:37.250
Wall Street, we understand
instinctively, regular people

00:07:37.250 --> 00:07:39.520
in the street, who have checking
accounts and go to

00:07:39.520 --> 00:07:41.770
the bank and use the financial
system every day and are

00:07:41.770 --> 00:07:45.260
effected by it, have really no
concept of just real basic

00:07:45.260 --> 00:07:46.970
function of the financial system
unless they really,

00:07:46.970 --> 00:07:49.140
really want to read in and
work out how to do it.

00:07:49.140 --> 00:07:51.190
So suddenly we started
to see another need.

00:07:51.190 --> 00:07:54.490
It's just the need for the most
basic explainers for the

00:07:54.490 --> 00:07:56.520
things that are going on on Wall
Street, which is really

00:07:56.520 --> 00:07:57.890
what the book is about.

00:07:57.890 --> 00:08:02.540
So that gave rise to a whole new
series of videos that we

00:08:02.540 --> 00:08:05.500
put out, and that really drove
me to put it down on paper as

00:08:05.500 --> 00:08:08.760
well, because we found that
while many people love to

00:08:08.760 --> 00:08:11.510
watch videos and they like to
listen to the radio, people

00:08:11.510 --> 00:08:13.370
still love to have a paper
product in their hand.

00:08:13.370 --> 00:08:15.680
I know that's really
disturbing to many

00:08:15.680 --> 00:08:17.575
technologists, but it's true.

00:08:17.575 --> 00:08:20.120
It's true.

00:08:20.120 --> 00:08:23.550
So now that I've told you what
we kind of both do, drawn us

00:08:23.550 --> 00:08:26.590
together there, what can I tell
you that you don't know?

00:08:26.590 --> 00:08:27.940
I don't think that's anything
that you don't know.

00:08:27.940 --> 00:08:32.140
But it's interesting to come
here, because you guys are the

00:08:32.140 --> 00:08:33.640
cream of Silicon
Valley, really.

00:08:33.640 --> 00:08:35.840
The cream of the American
workforce.

00:08:35.840 --> 00:08:37.289
And you do some really, really,

00:08:37.289 --> 00:08:38.960
really complicated things.

00:08:38.960 --> 00:08:42.000
You think the credit default
swap is complicated?

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:42.520
Wow.

00:08:42.520 --> 00:08:45.080
I can't imagine how difficult it
is for some of you guys to

00:08:45.080 --> 00:08:47.730
explain exactly what it
is that you do at

00:08:47.730 --> 00:08:49.280
dinner parties to people.

00:08:49.280 --> 00:08:52.250
Maybe you're an enterprise
technical solutions engineer

00:08:52.250 --> 00:08:55.600
or a space planning analyst.

00:08:55.600 --> 00:08:56.660
This is what you are.

00:08:56.660 --> 00:08:57.690
This is what you do.

00:08:57.690 --> 00:08:59.940
And I imagine that it's actually
quite difficult for

00:08:59.940 --> 00:09:03.340
you to explain these things to
people who have no idea about

00:09:03.340 --> 00:09:04.800
anything about your world.

00:09:04.800 --> 00:09:06.910
So if you're an engineer and
you're hanging out with a

00:09:06.910 --> 00:09:09.480
bunch of liberal arts majors
at the bar, trying to get

00:09:09.480 --> 00:09:13.500
across what it is you do can
be extremely difficult.

00:09:13.500 --> 00:09:16.580
So maybe I can help
you with that.

00:09:16.580 --> 00:09:17.450
But seriously.

00:09:17.450 --> 00:09:19.710
Explaining is useful when you're
trying to explain what

00:09:19.710 --> 00:09:22.100
you do at a party, but it's
essential when you're trying

00:09:22.100 --> 00:09:24.160
to get your message across in
whatever environment you're

00:09:24.160 --> 00:09:26.810
in, whether you're trying to
get a message across to a

00:09:26.810 --> 00:09:30.640
client, you're trying to tell
your supervisor about an idea

00:09:30.640 --> 00:09:32.890
that you have, or if you've got
a room full of people that

00:09:32.890 --> 00:09:37.410
you're pitching your idea to,
you need to have a number of

00:09:37.410 --> 00:09:39.590
basic elements to your
presentation.

00:09:39.590 --> 00:09:41.160
You need to be succinct.

00:09:41.160 --> 00:09:42.460
You need to be speedy.

00:09:42.460 --> 00:09:45.100
But most of all, you need to
find ways to connect--

00:09:45.100 --> 00:09:47.400
to use concepts in the
explanation that you're

00:09:47.400 --> 00:09:50.010
providing that your audience
is familiar with

00:09:50.010 --> 00:09:50.690
and can relate to.

00:09:50.690 --> 00:09:53.900
So what you really
need is a story.

00:09:53.900 --> 00:09:56.310
In radio, in Public Radio in
particular, were always really

00:09:56.310 --> 00:09:57.880
interested in the story.

00:09:57.880 --> 00:10:00.990
If you ever hear of journalists
talking or if

00:10:00.990 --> 00:10:04.360
you're referring to-- many
people refer to news items

00:10:04.360 --> 00:10:05.600
that they read in
the newspaper,

00:10:05.600 --> 00:10:07.195
they talk about stories.

00:10:07.195 --> 00:10:08.960
And there's a reason they
talk about stores.

00:10:08.960 --> 00:10:11.060
It's because people can
relate to stories.

00:10:11.060 --> 00:10:13.180
Many people relate very
well to data.

00:10:13.180 --> 00:10:15.010
Many people relate very
well to just the

00:10:15.010 --> 00:10:16.570
facts of the news man.

00:10:16.570 --> 00:10:19.130
But most people relate
best to a story.

00:10:19.130 --> 00:10:23.060
So the way we look at our news
is, and the way that I look at

00:10:23.060 --> 00:10:25.860
delivering information, it's
all about telling a story--

00:10:25.860 --> 00:10:27.330
which, if you read this book,
you'll find that what I've

00:10:27.330 --> 00:10:29.420
done is I've taken a whole bunch
of analogies and a whole

00:10:29.420 --> 00:10:31.540
bunch of stories and kind
of strung them together.

00:10:31.540 --> 00:10:35.320
And I've used storytelling
as the rubric to deliver

00:10:35.320 --> 00:10:37.330
information about some of the
most complex parts of the

00:10:37.330 --> 00:10:39.180
financial markets.

00:10:39.180 --> 00:10:42.110
So if you are an enterprise
technical solutions engineer

00:10:42.110 --> 00:10:45.270
or a space planning analyst,
tell people a story about what

00:10:45.270 --> 00:10:47.010
you do rather than just
delivering the

00:10:47.010 --> 00:10:48.440
facts of what you do.

00:10:48.440 --> 00:10:49.990
And relate it to what they do.

00:10:49.990 --> 00:10:53.720
So of course, first of
all you have to find

00:10:53.720 --> 00:10:55.120
out about your audience.

00:10:55.120 --> 00:10:57.260
So if you're an app developer,
you might want to ask, do you

00:10:57.260 --> 00:10:58.330
know what an app is.

00:10:58.330 --> 00:10:59.740
I think you'd be surprised
how many people don't

00:10:59.740 --> 00:11:01.000
know what an app is.

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:02.660
If you're a space planner,
maybe you want to ask if

00:11:02.660 --> 00:11:05.570
you've ever worked in a cubicle
or what type of office

00:11:05.570 --> 00:11:07.020
environment you have.

00:11:07.020 --> 00:11:09.630
A little empathetic interviewing
is always a

00:11:09.630 --> 00:11:10.790
really, really good
thing to do.

00:11:10.790 --> 00:11:12.360
You've got to know
your audience.

00:11:12.360 --> 00:11:13.550
It was interesting.

00:11:13.550 --> 00:11:16.850
I did a fellowship at Stanford
a couple of years ago.

00:11:16.850 --> 00:11:20.490
And I went to work in the
Hasso Plattner School of

00:11:20.490 --> 00:11:22.360
Design, the D school
over there.

00:11:22.360 --> 00:11:24.900
And it was very interesting
having a bunch of

00:11:24.900 --> 00:11:27.020
journalists-- there were about
seven or eight of us

00:11:27.020 --> 00:11:28.390
journalists from the fellowship
that had gone

00:11:28.390 --> 00:11:31.090
across to work in what's
essentially part of the

00:11:31.090 --> 00:11:31.560
engineering department.

00:11:31.560 --> 00:11:33.050
I think it's part of the
mechanical engineering

00:11:33.050 --> 00:11:33.860
department.

00:11:33.860 --> 00:11:36.890
And so we had a lot of interface
with engineers.

00:11:36.890 --> 00:11:41.280
And for us, design and the whole
idea of trying to put

00:11:41.280 --> 00:11:42.760
ideas together was really,
really difficult.

00:11:42.760 --> 00:11:45.340
But engineers find it really,
really simple.

00:11:45.340 --> 00:11:47.930
For engineers, going out and
getting information out of

00:11:47.930 --> 00:11:49.770
people was really,
really hard.

00:11:49.770 --> 00:11:52.610
But of course, it was second
nature to us as journalists.

00:11:52.610 --> 00:11:55.810
And that's one of the key parts
of any conversation that

00:11:55.810 --> 00:11:57.820
you have-- whenever you're
trying to deliver information

00:11:57.820 --> 00:12:00.110
about anything, you need to find
out about your audience.

00:12:00.110 --> 00:12:02.440
You've got to find out what your
audience knows, what your

00:12:02.440 --> 00:12:04.540
audience doesn't know.

00:12:04.540 --> 00:12:08.680
So what I do is I make some
assumptions in this book.

00:12:08.680 --> 00:12:11.220
I use analogy and characters
that I assume that most people

00:12:11.220 --> 00:12:12.680
are going to know.

00:12:12.680 --> 00:12:16.540
I deal with things like turkeys
and ice cream vans and

00:12:16.540 --> 00:12:19.440
The Three Little Pigs and The
Godfather, the movie.

00:12:19.440 --> 00:12:20.430
So I use all of these things.

00:12:20.430 --> 00:12:22.280
And I'm assuming that most
people who are reading the

00:12:22.280 --> 00:12:23.715
book will know these things.

00:12:23.715 --> 00:12:24.570
And hopefully they will.

00:12:24.570 --> 00:12:25.750
If not, they'll have to go
out and read about them.

00:12:25.750 --> 00:12:27.470
Or rent the movie The Godfather,
which great.

00:12:27.470 --> 00:12:28.440
Which is actually fine.

00:12:28.440 --> 00:12:30.720
That's a good bit
of preparation.

00:12:30.720 --> 00:12:32.770
That's another point, is that
you need to have some fun.

00:12:32.770 --> 00:12:34.646
You don't have to be a comedian,
but you don't want

00:12:34.646 --> 00:12:36.250
to take yourself too
seriously either.

00:12:36.250 --> 00:12:39.220
So again, this book is about
not taking the financial

00:12:39.220 --> 00:12:39.970
markets too seriously.

00:12:39.970 --> 00:12:42.450
We all know, they take
themselves way too seriously

00:12:42.450 --> 00:12:43.900
anyway, right?

00:12:43.900 --> 00:12:45.800
If we haven't seen that over the
last few years, what else

00:12:45.800 --> 00:12:46.180
do we know?

00:12:46.180 --> 00:12:48.400
So I'm trying not to take the
financial markets too

00:12:48.400 --> 00:12:51.050
seriously, poking a little
bit of fun, maybe.

00:12:51.050 --> 00:12:53.780
And in a way, I'm poking a
little bit of fun at myself.

00:12:53.780 --> 00:12:55.800
And I think that's actually
really key

00:12:55.800 --> 00:12:57.590
to explaining anything.

00:12:57.590 --> 00:12:59.160
If you show you have a sense of
humor, then you're going to

00:12:59.160 --> 00:13:01.150
relate better to people.

00:13:01.150 --> 00:13:03.575
So back to empathetic
interview.

00:13:03.575 --> 00:13:06.770
Who here would like a quick,
sort of smart, amusing way to

00:13:06.770 --> 00:13:09.190
understand the fiscal cliff?

00:13:09.190 --> 00:13:10.366
Any takers?

00:13:10.366 --> 00:13:11.060
Fiscal cliff, anyone?

00:13:11.060 --> 00:13:12.530
Good.

00:13:12.530 --> 00:13:12.980
OK, here's another one.

00:13:12.980 --> 00:13:15.394
Who's seen the movie
Thelma and Louise?

00:13:15.394 --> 00:13:17.050
OK.

00:13:17.050 --> 00:13:19.480
Who hasn't seen the movie
Thelme and Louise?

00:13:19.480 --> 00:13:21.980
OK, spoiler alert.

00:13:21.980 --> 00:13:24.400
There's a scene in this movie
where Thelma and Louise are

00:13:24.400 --> 00:13:26.420
driving dangerously fast
towards a cliff.

00:13:26.420 --> 00:13:28.540
Now, I'm going to do a
little drawing here.

00:13:28.540 --> 00:13:30.710
This is what I do with
this whiteboard

00:13:30.710 --> 00:13:31.310
product that I have.

00:13:31.310 --> 00:13:34.300
So I'm going to use the magic
of Google technology here to

00:13:34.300 --> 00:13:35.550
do a little drawing.

00:13:37.860 --> 00:13:39.290
So there we go, can
wee see that?

00:13:39.290 --> 00:13:41.570
Yes, I think we can.

00:13:41.570 --> 00:13:42.890
All right, so here we are.

00:13:42.890 --> 00:13:45.360
Imagine here's our car.

00:13:45.360 --> 00:13:46.970
And Thelma and Louise
are in this car.

00:13:46.970 --> 00:13:48.780
And as I say, it is
speeding along.

00:13:48.780 --> 00:13:49.610
It's like a Sunday afternoon.

00:13:49.610 --> 00:13:50.650
Here they are.

00:13:50.650 --> 00:13:51.345
This is Thelma.

00:13:51.345 --> 00:13:51.650
Here she is.

00:13:51.650 --> 00:13:54.420
And here's Louise.

00:13:54.420 --> 00:13:55.560
Speeding along in this car.

00:13:55.560 --> 00:13:58.070
And they're actually heading
uphill towards a very, very

00:13:58.070 --> 00:13:59.920
sharp cliff.

00:13:59.920 --> 00:14:01.170
Very fast.

00:14:03.710 --> 00:14:06.610
So they're motoring along
here at high speeds.

00:14:06.610 --> 00:14:11.110
And the cliff, essentially,
is the economy.

00:14:11.110 --> 00:14:13.290
So this is our economy.

00:14:13.290 --> 00:14:15.520
Right now, we're actually
pulling up reasonably well.

00:14:15.520 --> 00:14:16.510
We're doing pretty well.

00:14:16.510 --> 00:14:17.730
Not great.

00:14:17.730 --> 00:14:19.560
This slow and sluggish recovery
that we have.

00:14:19.560 --> 00:14:20.970
So we're sort of
driving uphill.

00:14:20.970 --> 00:14:23.620
But what we're worried about
is that come December the

00:14:23.620 --> 00:14:26.180
31st, we're going to go
hurtling over a cliff.

00:14:26.180 --> 00:14:28.040
Everybody's worried
about this.

00:14:28.040 --> 00:14:29.500
So that's the cliff.

00:14:29.500 --> 00:14:31.415
Let's talk about Thelma
and Louise.

00:14:31.415 --> 00:14:34.250
I'm going to turn the
page here if I can.

00:14:34.250 --> 00:14:36.630
So here's Thelma.

00:14:36.630 --> 00:14:43.840
And Thelma is a woman of a
certain age who happens to be

00:14:43.840 --> 00:14:45.150
relatively wealthy.

00:14:45.150 --> 00:14:48.380
And she benefits hugely from
the Bush tax cuts.

00:14:48.380 --> 00:14:50.650
She doesn't have to pay as much
tax, which means she's

00:14:50.650 --> 00:14:53.870
got much more money in her
pocket than she had before.

00:14:53.870 --> 00:14:56.200
Here's Louise.

00:14:56.200 --> 00:14:58.800
Louise is as a government
servant.

00:14:58.800 --> 00:15:01.790
In fact, she works in the
Defense Department.

00:15:01.790 --> 00:15:03.490
So she's a happy woman,
because we know

00:15:03.490 --> 00:15:05.410
defense pays very well.

00:15:08.420 --> 00:15:12.800
Now, the problem is that come
the end of the year, a couple

00:15:12.800 --> 00:15:16.380
of things are going to happen
if Congress doesn't act.

00:15:16.380 --> 00:15:19.140
The first thing that's going to
happen is the Bush tax cuts

00:15:19.140 --> 00:15:20.840
are going to expire.

00:15:20.840 --> 00:15:23.760
So if the Bush tax cuts expire,
this is going to make

00:15:23.760 --> 00:15:29.400
Thelma very unhappy, because
she's going to get taxed more.

00:15:29.400 --> 00:15:31.960
She's going to have a lot
less money to spend.

00:15:31.960 --> 00:15:34.210
Louise, come the end
of the year--

00:15:34.210 --> 00:15:36.130
the other thing that's going
to happen because of the

00:15:36.130 --> 00:15:39.770
finagling that we had about a
year ago over raising the debt

00:15:39.770 --> 00:15:41.960
ceiling, they said, oh,
well, let it go.

00:15:41.960 --> 00:15:44.540
But come the end of this year,
what's going to happen is

00:15:44.540 --> 00:15:46.710
we're going to make a bunch
of cuts across the board.

00:15:46.710 --> 00:15:48.510
And particularly in the
Defense Department.

00:15:48.510 --> 00:15:51.680
So come the end of the year,
Louise here is going

00:15:51.680 --> 00:15:52.820
to be out of a job.

00:15:52.820 --> 00:15:56.320
So she's going to be pretty
unhappy as well.

00:15:56.320 --> 00:15:58.140
So she's going to
be unhappy too.

00:15:58.140 --> 00:16:03.370
And what we have is, the money
that people had saved because

00:16:03.370 --> 00:16:04.850
of the Bush tax cuts
will dry out.

00:16:04.850 --> 00:16:07.120
So there'll be less money in
people's pockets as a result

00:16:07.120 --> 00:16:10.910
of the lack of extension
of the Bush tax cuts.

00:16:10.910 --> 00:16:12.630
And because you've got a bunch
of people laid off in the

00:16:12.630 --> 00:16:13.920
Defense Department, you're
going to have less

00:16:13.920 --> 00:16:15.490
money here as well.

00:16:15.490 --> 00:16:17.880
Now, we all know that
our economy pretty

00:16:17.880 --> 00:16:19.880
much thrives on spending.

00:16:19.880 --> 00:16:20.900
We hear this all the time.

00:16:20.900 --> 00:16:25.000
Some people talk about 70% of
economic output in the US is

00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:26.750
because of consumer spending.

00:16:26.750 --> 00:16:28.340
That's actually a fairly
inaccurate number, but it's

00:16:28.340 --> 00:16:29.950
still extremely high.

00:16:29.950 --> 00:16:31.340
The economy is really, really

00:16:31.340 --> 00:16:33.200
dependent on consumer spending.

00:16:33.200 --> 00:16:35.720
And if you've got consumers like
Thelma and Louise who've

00:16:35.720 --> 00:16:38.770
got a lot less money coming into
their pockets, it means

00:16:38.770 --> 00:16:40.680
that-- well, essentially, if
you think of the car as the

00:16:40.680 --> 00:16:43.620
economy, it means that they're
not going to be able to pay to

00:16:43.620 --> 00:16:45.520
fix the brakes or get
the oil changed.

00:16:45.520 --> 00:16:48.420
So when you're heading towards
a cliff, suddenly, there's

00:16:48.420 --> 00:16:50.930
nothing stopping you going
over the edge.

00:16:50.930 --> 00:16:52.720
It means we're going to
plunge over the edge.

00:16:52.720 --> 00:16:55.730
This lack of spending is going
to really put us straight back

00:16:55.730 --> 00:16:58.100
into the hole that we've
been in in the past.

00:16:58.100 --> 00:17:01.790
So that's how the fiscal
cliff is going to work.

00:17:01.790 --> 00:17:05.430
That is, if it's allowed
to occur.

00:17:05.430 --> 00:17:08.440
So what I'm trying to do there
is I'm trying to use stories

00:17:08.440 --> 00:17:11.980
and analogy to explain
a financial concept.

00:17:11.980 --> 00:17:13.630
Were there any holes in
that for you guys?

00:17:13.630 --> 00:17:16.810
Did anybody see any holes in
there, some areas that I

00:17:16.810 --> 00:17:17.380
didn't cover?

00:17:17.380 --> 00:17:19.187
Or have I explained the
fiscal cliff to you?

00:17:25.260 --> 00:17:27.020
Well, the government will hold
it because it wants to pay off

00:17:27.020 --> 00:17:28.430
its deficits.

00:17:28.430 --> 00:17:31.040
So the reason is, remember
we had the debt ceiling

00:17:31.040 --> 00:17:31.610
conversation?

00:17:31.610 --> 00:17:34.470
It's like we don't want to
increase our deficit, so the

00:17:34.470 --> 00:17:37.750
whole idea of having these
spending cuts and having more

00:17:37.750 --> 00:17:41.670
tax going into the federal
government means that they can

00:17:41.670 --> 00:17:44.150
then use that money to pay off
the debt, as opposed to

00:17:44.150 --> 00:17:46.760
injecting it back into the
economy in some way and

00:17:46.760 --> 00:17:48.580
helping the economy
grow again.

00:17:48.580 --> 00:17:50.950
And remember, the way that
spending works in the economy

00:17:50.950 --> 00:17:53.520
is that people like you
and I go out and we

00:17:53.520 --> 00:17:54.830
buy a home, for example.

00:17:54.830 --> 00:17:58.720
There's a reason that housing
is regarded as one of the

00:17:58.720 --> 00:18:00.880
biggest engines of the economic
recovery, is because

00:18:00.880 --> 00:18:03.220
people buy a house, but they
don't just buy a house.

00:18:03.220 --> 00:18:06.110
They buy carpets, they buy
curtains, they buy fridge

00:18:06.110 --> 00:18:08.340
freezers, they buy a car
to put in the garage.

00:18:08.340 --> 00:18:09.140
All this stuff.

00:18:09.140 --> 00:18:12.510
So all the spending that
they do drives demand.

00:18:12.510 --> 00:18:14.430
And that means that
manufacturers then have to

00:18:14.430 --> 00:18:15.700
create more.

00:18:15.700 --> 00:18:18.290
And the way that they do that
is by hiring more people and

00:18:18.290 --> 00:18:21.340
buying more property and
cranking out more stuff.

00:18:21.340 --> 00:18:24.305
And then you have this very
positive cycle, because as

00:18:24.305 --> 00:18:25.910
more people are employed then
they're going to spend more.

00:18:25.910 --> 00:18:27.310
And they're going to go
out and buy houses.

00:18:27.310 --> 00:18:29.670
And suddenly you have this very
beneficial effect cycling

00:18:29.670 --> 00:18:30.620
through the economy.

00:18:30.620 --> 00:18:31.780
At least, that's the theory.

00:18:31.780 --> 00:18:33.285
Of course, there are a lot of
people that don't like the

00:18:33.285 --> 00:18:35.900
fact that we have mainly a
consumer economy and are very

00:18:35.900 --> 00:18:36.690
upset about that.

00:18:36.690 --> 00:18:38.790
But right now, that's the
way we're configured.

00:18:38.790 --> 00:18:42.250
So that's the way
we're set up.

00:18:42.250 --> 00:18:47.090
So the whole point of a book
like this is to take, as I

00:18:47.090 --> 00:18:50.245
say, these potentially extremely
complicated terms

00:18:50.245 --> 00:18:53.120
and turn them into, really,
stories that

00:18:53.120 --> 00:18:54.420
everybody can relate to.

00:18:54.420 --> 00:18:57.290
So what I'd like to ask, are
there any other terms out

00:18:57.290 --> 00:18:59.880
there that people have
difficulty with when they hear

00:18:59.880 --> 00:19:00.730
about them?

00:19:00.730 --> 00:19:03.040
When they're listening to the
news or reading the news--

00:19:03.040 --> 00:19:04.800
like, I don't understand
what this is.

00:19:04.800 --> 00:19:07.010
Are there any sort of hot
points for people?

00:19:07.010 --> 00:19:08.050
Any words that we don't
understand?

00:19:08.050 --> 00:19:09.300
Yes.

00:19:13.380 --> 00:19:15.070
And quantitative easing
is all about--

00:19:15.070 --> 00:19:17.010
OK, well, let me use
an analogy that I

00:19:17.010 --> 00:19:18.740
actually use in the book.

00:19:18.740 --> 00:19:20.033
I want you to imagine--

00:19:20.033 --> 00:19:21.850
I'm not going to draw this, this
is really hard to draw,

00:19:21.850 --> 00:19:24.800
all right?-- but I want you to
imagine a swimming pool that's

00:19:24.800 --> 00:19:27.340
got kind of a dam at
one end of it.

00:19:27.340 --> 00:19:28.560
And the swimming pool is--

00:19:28.560 --> 00:19:31.890
behind the dam, which is, say,
3/4 of the way up-- behind the

00:19:31.890 --> 00:19:33.140
dam it's full of water.

00:19:35.900 --> 00:19:39.060
So you have to swim in that
one end of the pool, the

00:19:39.060 --> 00:19:39.610
dammed end.

00:19:39.610 --> 00:19:40.770
On the other end, you sort
of paddle around.

00:19:40.770 --> 00:19:44.020
There's a little bit of
ankle-deep water right there.

00:19:44.020 --> 00:19:46.800
The stuff that's behind the dam
is where the banks are.

00:19:46.800 --> 00:19:47.820
That's where all the money is.

00:19:47.820 --> 00:19:49.110
It's all in the banks.

00:19:49.110 --> 00:19:52.380
And what happens is money sort
of sloshes in and slashes out

00:19:52.380 --> 00:19:54.110
of the paddling part
of the pool.

00:19:54.110 --> 00:19:56.370
You don't want too much money
in that end of the pool,

00:19:56.370 --> 00:19:57.860
because not everybody
can swim that well.

00:19:57.860 --> 00:19:59.190
You want people to sort
of paddle around.

00:19:59.190 --> 00:20:01.224
And that helps things grow in
there, because this is a pool

00:20:01.224 --> 00:20:02.063
that's got stuff
growing in it.

00:20:02.063 --> 00:20:03.405
So that helps stuff grow.

00:20:03.405 --> 00:20:06.530
And people are quite happy
paddling around.

00:20:06.530 --> 00:20:09.630
The problem is that the
situation we have now is that

00:20:09.630 --> 00:20:11.830
there's not enough water in
that end of the pool.

00:20:11.830 --> 00:20:15.000
The banks aren't sloshing
enough water in there.

00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:16.170
And what's happened
is that we've got

00:20:16.170 --> 00:20:17.580
this sort of dry situation.

00:20:17.580 --> 00:20:20.030
And that water is
really money.

00:20:20.030 --> 00:20:22.920
That's the money that we used
to go out and borrow to buy

00:20:22.920 --> 00:20:25.392
stuff-- to buy those houses,
to buy those cars, to buy

00:20:25.392 --> 00:20:27.280
those fridge freezers and
all the rest of it.

00:20:27.280 --> 00:20:28.860
Right now, we're not
able to borrow.

00:20:28.860 --> 00:20:31.740
It's really, really difficult
for us to borrow.

00:20:31.740 --> 00:20:33.620
Usually what happens in the
financial system is we have a

00:20:33.620 --> 00:20:35.640
set amount of money
in the system.

00:20:35.640 --> 00:20:37.230
And the money sloshes
in and sloshes out.

00:20:37.230 --> 00:20:39.370
So the bankers will chuck a
bucket over and then when

00:20:39.370 --> 00:20:41.530
we're saving, we'll chuck a
bucket back and all this.

00:20:41.530 --> 00:20:43.770
It's usually the same
amount of water.

00:20:43.770 --> 00:20:46.320
Quantitative easing is like the
janitor coming along with

00:20:46.320 --> 00:20:49.200
a hose pipe and turning it on
and pumping a whole lot of

00:20:49.200 --> 00:20:51.180
extra water in there.

00:20:51.180 --> 00:20:53.520
And the idea is that he's
flooding that end--

00:20:53.520 --> 00:20:56.290
and when I say "in there,"
I mean the banking end.

00:20:56.290 --> 00:20:58.390
Not in the shallow end,
in the deep end.

00:20:58.390 --> 00:21:00.670
They're pumping extra water
into the deep end.

00:21:00.670 --> 00:21:03.870
The idea is to make the bankers
so uncomfortable that

00:21:03.870 --> 00:21:05.830
they want to start
bailing water out

00:21:05.830 --> 00:21:07.090
much, much more quickly.

00:21:07.090 --> 00:21:08.080
Because here's the thing.

00:21:08.080 --> 00:21:08.610
Bankers--

00:21:08.610 --> 00:21:11.380
this is going to sound really
weird-- bankers hate money.

00:21:11.380 --> 00:21:12.030
They hate it.

00:21:12.030 --> 00:21:13.640
All right, they don't hate it.

00:21:13.640 --> 00:21:15.530
But they hate having--

00:21:15.530 --> 00:21:16.380
they hate cash.

00:21:16.380 --> 00:21:18.150
They hate having
to sit on cash.

00:21:18.150 --> 00:21:20.505
Because cash doesn't make any
money, cash just sits there.

00:21:20.505 --> 00:21:21.810
In fact, cash is a depreciating

00:21:21.810 --> 00:21:23.240
asset because of inflation.

00:21:23.240 --> 00:21:24.420
It's worth less every day.

00:21:24.420 --> 00:21:27.040
Only fractionally in our
economy, but it's worth less

00:21:27.040 --> 00:21:28.030
as time goes on.

00:21:28.030 --> 00:21:29.460
Bankers want to invest money.

00:21:29.460 --> 00:21:31.980
But right now, they're really
nervous about investing.

00:21:31.980 --> 00:21:33.660
They're like, oh, no, we're
quite happy to just sort of

00:21:33.660 --> 00:21:38.020
swim around because we want to
have lots of cash around just

00:21:38.020 --> 00:21:39.200
in case something happens.

00:21:39.200 --> 00:21:40.720
So they're sitting on
all sorts of cash.

00:21:40.720 --> 00:21:42.260
Also, to be fair to the banks,
because the government's

00:21:42.260 --> 00:21:44.110
asking them to keep
more cash around.

00:21:44.110 --> 00:21:48.780
So by pumping more money into
the banking end of the system,

00:21:48.780 --> 00:21:50.340
they're hoping that the bankers
will say, god, we've

00:21:50.340 --> 00:21:51.550
got so much of this cash.

00:21:51.550 --> 00:21:52.790
It's not making us any money.

00:21:52.790 --> 00:21:54.020
Let's find ways to
make it money.

00:21:54.020 --> 00:21:56.170
Let's toss it into the other
end of the pool.

00:21:56.170 --> 00:21:58.290
So they're hoping that the banks
will throw buckets of

00:21:58.290 --> 00:22:00.770
water into the shallow end of
the pool to people like us.

00:22:00.770 --> 00:22:02.050
And we'll be like,
oh, yes, please.

00:22:02.050 --> 00:22:03.222
Please, feed us.

00:22:03.222 --> 00:22:04.660
Help us drink.

00:22:04.660 --> 00:22:07.290
And we'll be able to take this
money and run around and spend

00:22:07.290 --> 00:22:11.390
it on all sorts of things, and
therefore have this positive

00:22:11.390 --> 00:22:13.680
cycle throughout the economy
where people start buying

00:22:13.680 --> 00:22:16.670
stuff, employers start hiring
again, and then the economy

00:22:16.670 --> 00:22:18.130
starts to grow.

00:22:18.130 --> 00:22:20.430
So that's my summing cool
analogy of how quantitative

00:22:20.430 --> 00:22:21.530
easing works.

00:22:21.530 --> 00:22:23.530
Of course, a lot of people say,
one of the problems is

00:22:23.530 --> 00:22:26.470
now we've got all of this money
that's sloshing, this

00:22:26.470 --> 00:22:27.080
extra money.

00:22:27.080 --> 00:22:28.120
Well, what happens?

00:22:28.120 --> 00:22:30.080
And one of the dangers is that
if too much money goes into

00:22:30.080 --> 00:22:33.100
the wider economy, we have
inflation, where you've got

00:22:33.100 --> 00:22:34.990
much more money chasing
a relatively

00:22:34.990 --> 00:22:35.820
small amount of goods.

00:22:35.820 --> 00:22:36.610
And what does that do?

00:22:36.610 --> 00:22:37.990
It drives the cost
of everything

00:22:37.990 --> 00:22:39.270
really, really high.

00:22:39.270 --> 00:22:40.160
Now, we've had two--

00:22:40.160 --> 00:22:41.260
we're obviously in the
third round of

00:22:41.260 --> 00:22:42.610
quantitative easing now.

00:22:42.610 --> 00:22:44.930
But the previous two rounds
actually didn't do much in

00:22:44.930 --> 00:22:47.080
terms of inflation-- barely
moved the needle.

00:22:47.080 --> 00:22:48.260
Wasn't really a problem.

00:22:48.260 --> 00:22:50.100
People are still worried
about going forward.

00:22:50.100 --> 00:22:52.320
So what happens, you
ask, to that money?

00:22:52.320 --> 00:22:53.750
Does it just sit around?

00:22:53.750 --> 00:22:54.040
No.

00:22:54.040 --> 00:22:57.330
In actual fact, the janitor can
then get a bucket, start

00:22:57.330 --> 00:22:59.390
dipping the bucket into the
banker's end, and taking money

00:22:59.390 --> 00:23:01.440
back out of there.

00:23:01.440 --> 00:23:03.250
That's what Ben Bernanke
will, in fact, do.

00:23:03.250 --> 00:23:05.400
This is called the destruction
of money.

00:23:05.400 --> 00:23:07.210
This is done through something
called the repo system, which

00:23:07.210 --> 00:23:08.920
I can talk about in a little
bit if you want.

00:23:08.920 --> 00:23:11.890
But essentially, it is
effectively that janitor, Ben

00:23:11.890 --> 00:23:13.283
the janitor, coming along.

00:23:13.283 --> 00:23:16.240
dipping a bunch of buckets in to
take the money back out of

00:23:16.240 --> 00:23:16.870
the system.

00:23:16.870 --> 00:23:19.160
So once again, we have the same
amount of money in the

00:23:19.160 --> 00:23:21.390
monetary system that
we had before.

00:23:21.390 --> 00:23:22.656
How's that?

00:23:22.656 --> 00:23:24.110
Great, thank you.

00:23:24.110 --> 00:23:26.980
All right, any other terms that
people are nervous about

00:23:26.980 --> 00:23:29.070
or confused about?

00:23:29.070 --> 00:23:29.840
Unsure about?

00:23:29.840 --> 00:23:31.090
Yes.

00:23:34.705 --> 00:23:35.400
Well, yes.

00:23:35.400 --> 00:23:36.770
They do that just
through lending.

00:23:36.770 --> 00:23:38.500
So if you want to think of--

00:23:38.500 --> 00:23:41.180
maybe there's two little
pipes at the

00:23:41.180 --> 00:23:42.590
bottom of the wall there.

00:23:42.590 --> 00:23:43.990
And one pipe pumps money out.

00:23:43.990 --> 00:23:46.030
And that's done through mortgage
lending, through car

00:23:46.030 --> 00:23:47.760
lending, student loans,
all the rest of it.

00:23:47.760 --> 00:23:50.540
Any kind of lending activity
that sends money out into the

00:23:50.540 --> 00:23:51.640
wider economy.

00:23:51.640 --> 00:23:53.840
And of course, the other tube
is where we pump it back in,

00:23:53.840 --> 00:23:55.600
which, of course, we
do through savings.

00:23:55.600 --> 00:23:58.070
And right now, the savings rate
is going up in the US.

00:23:58.070 --> 00:24:00.020
People are socking away money.

00:24:00.020 --> 00:24:03.790
So you've got cash flowing in
and out of the banking system.

00:24:03.790 --> 00:24:06.620
And it's not the entirely--

00:24:06.620 --> 00:24:08.540
I don't want to vilify
the banks too much.

00:24:08.540 --> 00:24:10.910
It's not entirely the banks'
fault that we're socking away

00:24:10.910 --> 00:24:13.250
money like this and actually not
spending it, because we're

00:24:13.250 --> 00:24:15.290
being every bit as cautious
as they are.

00:24:15.290 --> 00:24:16.910
That's a great question,
thank you.

00:24:20.790 --> 00:24:21.980
Well, the gold standard--

00:24:21.980 --> 00:24:23.420
does everybody know what--
does anybody--

00:24:23.420 --> 00:24:25.940
OK, let me explain what
the gold standard is.

00:24:25.940 --> 00:24:28.420
Back in the day, back before
the Nixon administration,

00:24:28.420 --> 00:24:31.580
whenever they removed the gold
standard, it used to be that

00:24:31.580 --> 00:24:33.890
every dollar was worth a
certain amount of gold.

00:24:33.890 --> 00:24:37.190
And in theory, you could take
your dollar and walk in and

00:24:37.190 --> 00:24:40.100
say, give me a dollar's
worth of gold.

00:24:40.100 --> 00:24:42.790
And they would give you
a tiny little grain.

00:24:42.790 --> 00:24:43.890
No, they wouldn't.

00:24:43.890 --> 00:24:45.220
But essentially, that was
what it was worth.

00:24:45.220 --> 00:24:48.520
So every dollar was backed by
gold, which was in Fort Knox,

00:24:48.520 --> 00:24:50.760
or wherever they
kept the gold.

00:24:50.760 --> 00:24:53.350
So of course, you now know that
your dollar is actually

00:24:53.350 --> 00:24:55.750
worth something real.

00:24:55.750 --> 00:24:57.500
So if you have enough of those
dollars, you can walk out with

00:24:57.500 --> 00:24:59.570
a nugget or an ingot
or whatever it is.

00:24:59.570 --> 00:25:02.300
So there's immense appeal to
that, of knowing what your

00:25:02.300 --> 00:25:03.990
dollar's actually worth.

00:25:03.990 --> 00:25:06.200
But of course, it gets
complicated if you want to do

00:25:06.200 --> 00:25:09.420
things like spend vast amounts
of money on defense spending

00:25:09.420 --> 00:25:12.030
or build a whole load of bridges
and freeways around

00:25:12.030 --> 00:25:16.120
the country, because maybe you
don't have that much gold.

00:25:16.120 --> 00:25:18.880
Suddenly if you want to go out
and get extra gold in order to

00:25:18.880 --> 00:25:22.160
print more money, you've got
to go to South Africa or

00:25:22.160 --> 00:25:24.190
wherever it is and do a bunch
more mining or go to China and

00:25:24.190 --> 00:25:26.080
beg them to sell your gold,
or whatever it is.

00:25:26.080 --> 00:25:27.330
And that can get extremely
expensive,

00:25:27.330 --> 00:25:28.460
because what happens--

00:25:28.460 --> 00:25:31.330
as soon as you have a large
economy that needs more money,

00:25:31.330 --> 00:25:33.370
the price of gold is going to
go through the roof because

00:25:33.370 --> 00:25:34.870
demand has risen so much.

00:25:34.870 --> 00:25:36.740
It's a classic supply
and demand issue.

00:25:36.740 --> 00:25:38.100
And what does that do?

00:25:38.100 --> 00:25:40.330
That increases the value
of the dollar.

00:25:40.330 --> 00:25:43.870
And then you have this terrible
deflation system,

00:25:43.870 --> 00:25:46.570
where you've got the dollar has
become so expensive and

00:25:46.570 --> 00:25:49.720
goods have become devalued
in comparison.

00:25:49.720 --> 00:25:52.320
So people were very nervous
about this.

00:25:52.320 --> 00:25:54.410
So they said, well, let's get
rid of this thing, because it

00:25:54.410 --> 00:25:56.010
doesn't give us any freedom
as an economy.

00:25:56.010 --> 00:25:58.910
If we want to expand, that
really restricts our freedom.

00:25:58.910 --> 00:26:01.165
So they created what's
called fiat currency.

00:26:01.165 --> 00:26:04.340
And fiat currency basically
means, it is what the

00:26:04.340 --> 00:26:06.000
government says it is.

00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:08.980
This is worth $1 because the
government says it's worth $1.

00:26:08.980 --> 00:26:11.750
Which is a really kind
of weird system.

00:26:11.750 --> 00:26:15.880
It means that really, the dollar
is worth only the paper

00:26:15.880 --> 00:26:18.220
that it's written on.

00:26:18.220 --> 00:26:20.825
And it's only the government's
word that actually makes it

00:26:20.825 --> 00:26:21.730
worth any money.

00:26:21.730 --> 00:26:25.820
So it can be a very difficult to
thing for people to grasp.

00:26:25.820 --> 00:26:28.280
And what it really comes
down to is trust.

00:26:28.280 --> 00:26:29.920
You've got to trust
your government.

00:26:29.920 --> 00:26:32.350
You've got to trust that your
dollar is going to be worth

00:26:32.350 --> 00:26:35.650
the same tomorrow
as it is today.

00:26:35.650 --> 00:26:38.445
Or the same in two years
as it is today.

00:26:38.445 --> 00:26:39.820
And of course, that
doesn't happen

00:26:39.820 --> 00:26:41.630
because we have inflation.

00:26:41.630 --> 00:26:43.960
So what we do is we trust the
government to make sure that

00:26:43.960 --> 00:26:45.420
inflation is low.

00:26:45.420 --> 00:26:47.690
And that our dollars
are not devalued.

00:26:47.690 --> 00:26:50.890
So it's not surprising,
especially in an era where we

00:26:50.890 --> 00:26:53.330
have all sorts of quantitative
easing, where we have all of

00:26:53.330 --> 00:26:55.760
this money that's sloshing
around the system and people

00:26:55.760 --> 00:26:57.390
are really worried
about inflation.

00:26:57.390 --> 00:26:59.830
They say, maybe we should go
back to the gold standard,

00:26:59.830 --> 00:27:01.750
where everything is worth
something real.

00:27:01.750 --> 00:27:04.205
So it's totally understandable
why people say that.

00:27:04.205 --> 00:27:08.200
But I have to say that now going
back to a system where

00:27:08.200 --> 00:27:10.690
every dollar was backed with a
certain amount of gold would

00:27:10.690 --> 00:27:12.180
be incredibly difficult to do.

00:27:12.180 --> 00:27:15.620
Firstly, there's not that much
gold in the world right now.

00:27:15.620 --> 00:27:17.030
I mean, look at the size
of the economies

00:27:17.030 --> 00:27:17.970
that we have now.

00:27:17.970 --> 00:27:19.550
Can you imagine if China decided
to do the same thing

00:27:19.550 --> 00:27:21.010
at the same time
that we did it?

00:27:21.010 --> 00:27:22.940
And Europe as well.

00:27:22.940 --> 00:27:24.500
How much gold would you be
getting for your euro?

00:27:24.500 --> 00:27:26.840
It'd be infinitesimal.

00:27:26.840 --> 00:27:29.480
So it's understandable that
people are interested in the

00:27:29.480 --> 00:27:31.280
gold standard, but it's a very,
very difficult system to

00:27:31.280 --> 00:27:31.960
go back to.

00:27:31.960 --> 00:27:32.790
That's a great question.

00:27:32.790 --> 00:27:34.040
Thank you.

00:27:38.070 --> 00:27:40.290
Well, you have to spend less.

00:27:40.290 --> 00:27:43.840
A lot of people talk about
the similarity between a

00:27:43.840 --> 00:27:45.930
government and a house--

00:27:45.930 --> 00:27:48.310
somebody's individual
bank account, their

00:27:48.310 --> 00:27:50.190
own personal economies.

00:27:50.190 --> 00:27:51.790
And there's a lot of
truth to that.

00:27:51.790 --> 00:27:54.950
The analogy doesn't extend much
further, but essentially,

00:27:54.950 --> 00:27:56.810
you've got money coming
in the door and money

00:27:56.810 --> 00:27:57.800
going out the door.

00:27:57.800 --> 00:28:00.920
And that money coming in the
door comes from whatever

00:28:00.920 --> 00:28:06.480
you've sold your ability to work
for plus debt that comes

00:28:06.480 --> 00:28:07.100
in the door.

00:28:07.100 --> 00:28:08.850
And money that goes out the
door is all the stuff

00:28:08.850 --> 00:28:09.910
that you spend on.

00:28:09.910 --> 00:28:11.980
All the services that you
have around the home--

00:28:11.980 --> 00:28:13.700
electricity, heating,
whatever--

00:28:13.700 --> 00:28:15.030
plus your car.

00:28:15.030 --> 00:28:16.900
Plus the interest that you're
paying on that debt that's

00:28:16.900 --> 00:28:17.930
coming in the door.

00:28:17.930 --> 00:28:20.720
So when you look at it like
that, that looks a lot like

00:28:20.720 --> 00:28:21.740
the economy.

00:28:21.740 --> 00:28:24.140
So really, the only way you can
reduce those costs, those

00:28:24.140 --> 00:28:26.460
expenditure costs, is
by cutting back.

00:28:26.460 --> 00:28:28.130
It's by heating your
house less.

00:28:28.130 --> 00:28:30.090
Maybe it's like wearing
a sweater for longer.

00:28:30.090 --> 00:28:33.430
Maybe it's like selling one car
and getting a cheaper car.

00:28:33.430 --> 00:28:35.130
But you have to cut
your costs.

00:28:35.130 --> 00:28:38.230
Which is what all of the
shenanigans going on in the

00:28:38.230 --> 00:28:41.670
government is all about right
now, it's trying to decide

00:28:41.670 --> 00:28:43.300
what it is that you cut.

00:28:43.300 --> 00:28:46.660
Yes, of course, you could remove
all social programs,

00:28:46.660 --> 00:28:47.680
crank the tax rate up.

00:28:47.680 --> 00:28:49.940
Suddenly, you've got much more
money coming in the door if

00:28:49.940 --> 00:28:52.200
your tax rate is at 40%.

00:28:52.200 --> 00:28:54.440
Suddenly you've got way more
money coming in the door if

00:28:54.440 --> 00:28:56.470
you remove all of those
entitlement programs--

00:28:56.470 --> 00:28:58.230
Medicare, Medicaid, and
all the rest of it.

00:28:58.230 --> 00:29:00.600
Suddenly, you've got much less
money going out the door.

00:29:00.600 --> 00:29:01.490
And yeah, it's going
to be easy to pay

00:29:01.490 --> 00:29:02.250
your debt off then.

00:29:02.250 --> 00:29:03.190
Absolutely.

00:29:03.190 --> 00:29:04.750
The logic is impeccable.

00:29:04.750 --> 00:29:07.200
But the practicality of that
is extremely difficult.

00:29:07.200 --> 00:29:10.180
You think about what we spend
as a nation every year, more

00:29:10.180 --> 00:29:13.630
than 50% of the money that we
spend is spent on mandatory

00:29:13.630 --> 00:29:16.820
spending programs, like Social
Security, like Medicare.

00:29:16.820 --> 00:29:18.530
These are programs that cannot--
it's not like a

00:29:18.530 --> 00:29:21.250
business, where a business owner
can turn around and go,

00:29:21.250 --> 00:29:21.820
you know what?

00:29:21.820 --> 00:29:24.970
We're going to get rid of
the Android division.

00:29:24.970 --> 00:29:26.960
It's gone.

00:29:26.960 --> 00:29:27.980
A company can do that.

00:29:27.980 --> 00:29:29.260
A company can say,
you know what?

00:29:29.260 --> 00:29:30.820
We're going to get out of
the software business.

00:29:30.820 --> 00:29:32.330
Let's get into the health
care business.

00:29:32.330 --> 00:29:33.520
A company can do that.

00:29:33.520 --> 00:29:35.610
It can make those changes.

00:29:35.610 --> 00:29:37.310
An economy cannot.

00:29:37.310 --> 00:29:40.480
We are required to provide
those services by law.

00:29:40.480 --> 00:29:41.980
Sure, you can trim them down.

00:29:41.980 --> 00:29:43.250
And that's a lot of
what the back and

00:29:43.250 --> 00:29:44.910
forth is about in Congress.

00:29:44.910 --> 00:29:46.970
You can shrink them and
make them smaller.

00:29:46.970 --> 00:29:48.160
But getting rid of
them all together

00:29:48.160 --> 00:29:49.920
is extremely difficult.

00:29:49.920 --> 00:29:53.300
So what's not mandatory, what
they call the discretionary

00:29:53.300 --> 00:29:55.830
spending, it's all these really
unimportant things like

00:29:55.830 --> 00:29:59.090
education, roads, the Coast
Guard, defense.

00:30:01.980 --> 00:30:03.310
This is the discretionary
spending.

00:30:03.310 --> 00:30:05.520
This is the stuff that the
government is not required,

00:30:05.520 --> 00:30:07.070
mandated, to spend on.

00:30:07.070 --> 00:30:09.300
But again, you try and cut that
stuff and boy, people are

00:30:09.300 --> 00:30:10.950
going to start to howl.

00:30:10.950 --> 00:30:15.430
So yes, in principle,
absolutely right.

00:30:15.430 --> 00:30:17.480
You could reduce those programs

00:30:17.480 --> 00:30:18.590
and reduce your spending.

00:30:18.590 --> 00:30:21.640
But actually making the
decision, the way to go about

00:30:21.640 --> 00:30:24.570
making the decisions what to
cut and what not to cut are

00:30:24.570 --> 00:30:28.010
extremely difficult and
frought with politics.

00:30:28.010 --> 00:30:28.960
One of the things--

00:30:28.960 --> 00:30:31.460
what's interesting about the
presidential election is that

00:30:31.460 --> 00:30:34.280
you have Mitt Romney walking
around and saying, look, I'm a

00:30:34.280 --> 00:30:35.340
businessman.

00:30:35.340 --> 00:30:38.280
I've had so much experience in
business, I'm going to know

00:30:38.280 --> 00:30:41.190
how to be able to handle
our economy better.

00:30:41.190 --> 00:30:42.880
And of course, in many
ways that's true.

00:30:42.880 --> 00:30:45.110
It would be great to have
someone who understands how a

00:30:45.110 --> 00:30:48.430
business works to run the
economy, especially when its

00:30:48.430 --> 00:30:50.222
got business functions.

00:30:50.222 --> 00:30:54.240
But Mitt Romney is the
CEO of a company.

00:30:54.240 --> 00:30:58.000
When he wants to make a
decision, what he says or what

00:30:58.000 --> 00:31:00.080
she says goes.

00:31:00.080 --> 00:31:02.120
They're at the top of a pyramid
and everybody reports

00:31:02.120 --> 00:31:02.640
up the pyramid.

00:31:02.640 --> 00:31:06.610
So essentially, everybody
reports to the CEO.

00:31:06.610 --> 00:31:08.060
In an economy that's
not the case.

00:31:08.060 --> 00:31:12.170
In a government, he's got
whatever 600-odd people in the

00:31:12.170 --> 00:31:15.360
Congress up on Capitol Hill in
the Senate and the House of

00:31:15.360 --> 00:31:19.230
Representatives, reporting not
to him but reporting to us.

00:31:19.230 --> 00:31:21.180
So if the President goes down
and says, I want you to vote

00:31:21.180 --> 00:31:23.780
my way on this bill,
they're like, no.

00:31:23.780 --> 00:31:26.130
I report to Jill and
Ben over here.

00:31:26.130 --> 00:31:27.090
I don't report to you.

00:31:27.090 --> 00:31:28.420
You can't tell me what to do.

00:31:28.420 --> 00:31:30.990
So not really a parallel
structure.

00:31:30.990 --> 00:31:34.421
So the same rules at that
point do not apply.

00:31:38.350 --> 00:31:39.280
Yes.

00:31:39.280 --> 00:31:41.570
It's really interesting.

00:31:41.570 --> 00:31:47.030
I like to liken our regulatory
system, and the financial

00:31:47.030 --> 00:31:51.140
services system within it,
to-- it's kind of like a

00:31:51.140 --> 00:31:53.680
teenager who's growing up and
has been wearing the same

00:31:53.680 --> 00:31:55.550
clothes since he was
nine years old.

00:31:55.550 --> 00:31:58.680
He's now 15, he's starting to
play football, and he's

00:31:58.680 --> 00:31:59.940
busting out of these clothes.

00:31:59.940 --> 00:32:02.070
Everything is completely
threadbare.

00:32:02.070 --> 00:32:03.920
This is what our financial
system is like.

00:32:03.920 --> 00:32:06.690
Over the last 20 to 30 years,
our financial system has gone

00:32:06.690 --> 00:32:08.220
off on steroids.

00:32:08.220 --> 00:32:09.540
It's gone crazy.

00:32:09.540 --> 00:32:11.190
All of this financial innovation
that you've heard

00:32:11.190 --> 00:32:14.150
about-- this credit default
swap, these CDOs, these are

00:32:14.150 --> 00:32:17.510
relatively recent arrivals
in the market.

00:32:17.510 --> 00:32:19.220
And what has happened is that
the regulatory system

00:32:19.220 --> 00:32:20.570
has not kept up.

00:32:20.570 --> 00:32:23.190
The regulatory system in its
current form was really

00:32:23.190 --> 00:32:26.300
recreated in the 1930s, after
the Great Depression.

00:32:26.300 --> 00:32:28.230
And it was a great system
for its time.

00:32:28.230 --> 00:32:29.620
It really, really worked well.

00:32:29.620 --> 00:32:31.720
And what we've done since then
is we've just sort of patched

00:32:31.720 --> 00:32:33.520
it here and there and
we've cut holes

00:32:33.520 --> 00:32:34.410
in it here and there.

00:32:34.410 --> 00:32:37.880
It's a bit like a leaky bucket
that's been sort of taped up

00:32:37.880 --> 00:32:38.750
and then it's leaked again.

00:32:38.750 --> 00:32:39.720
It's taped up again.

00:32:39.720 --> 00:32:41.590
And it leaks again and
you tape it up again.

00:32:41.590 --> 00:32:46.190
So it's now turned into this
monster of tape and metal and

00:32:46.190 --> 00:32:47.570
leaking water everywhere.

00:32:47.570 --> 00:32:49.640
That's what our regulatory
system looks like now with

00:32:49.640 --> 00:32:51.190
regard to the financial
system.

00:32:51.190 --> 00:32:53.910
So you've got these incredibly
smart people who are working

00:32:53.910 --> 00:32:56.490
in finance, who are coming up
with all these amazing ideas

00:32:56.490 --> 00:32:57.670
about how to make money.

00:32:57.670 --> 00:33:02.870
But really, the regulators
are two decades behind.

00:33:02.870 --> 00:33:04.090
They don't really under--

00:33:04.090 --> 00:33:11.570
if you ever listened to any of
the Congressional statements

00:33:11.570 --> 00:33:13.560
that came out after the
financial crisis, it was very,

00:33:13.560 --> 00:33:17.200
very clear that people on
Capitol Hill had no idea what

00:33:17.200 --> 00:33:18.340
they were dealing with.

00:33:18.340 --> 00:33:20.860
They were still thinking stocks
and bonds, whereas Wall

00:33:20.860 --> 00:33:24.320
Street was thinking martian
credit default swaps.

00:33:24.320 --> 00:33:25.250
It was just ridiculous.

00:33:25.250 --> 00:33:28.060
There was no correlation
in knowledge.

00:33:28.060 --> 00:33:33.140
So what we really need is a
financial system that is, I

00:33:33.140 --> 00:33:35.300
believe-- and this is just a
very personal opinion-- but I

00:33:35.300 --> 00:33:37.620
believe we need a financial
system that is simpler and a

00:33:37.620 --> 00:33:38.690
lot more robust.

00:33:38.690 --> 00:33:40.770
And much, much better policed.

00:33:40.770 --> 00:33:44.030
Because what's happened over the
last 50 years, really, is

00:33:44.030 --> 00:33:49.350
that the rise of the bank lobby
has forced politicians

00:33:49.350 --> 00:33:53.040
to pick the bones of the
policing of the regulatory

00:33:53.040 --> 00:33:53.650
system clean.

00:33:53.650 --> 00:33:56.650
The SEC has been underfunded,
it's been undermanned, and

00:33:56.650 --> 00:33:59.270
really just can't compete
with Wall Street.

00:33:59.270 --> 00:34:02.490
And also, it's punched holes in
the system that allow banks

00:34:02.490 --> 00:34:06.330
ways to look for ways
around the system in

00:34:06.330 --> 00:34:06.980
order to make money.

00:34:06.980 --> 00:34:09.780
And nobody's stitched those
loopholes closed.

00:34:09.780 --> 00:34:12.530
And in fact, many people have
tried to tear them and make

00:34:12.530 --> 00:34:13.389
them bigger.

00:34:13.389 --> 00:34:15.365
So that's really what
the problem is.

00:34:15.365 --> 00:34:17.870
But don't blame the
banks for this.

00:34:17.870 --> 00:34:20.389
The banks are glands.

00:34:20.389 --> 00:34:21.600
There's no sensibility there.

00:34:21.600 --> 00:34:23.679
There's no morality there.

00:34:23.679 --> 00:34:25.120
Their job is to make
money for their

00:34:25.120 --> 00:34:27.120
shareholders, plain and simple.

00:34:27.120 --> 00:34:28.520
That's what their job is.

00:34:28.520 --> 00:34:30.780
They are there to crank out
as much money for their

00:34:30.780 --> 00:34:32.909
shareholders, which obviously
includes the board and all the

00:34:32.909 --> 00:34:33.810
rest of it--

00:34:33.810 --> 00:34:36.199
and, by the way, you and I,
because our 401(k)s and

00:34:36.199 --> 00:34:39.480
403(b)s are invested in large
part with the banks.

00:34:39.480 --> 00:34:41.300
Their job is to make
money for us.

00:34:41.300 --> 00:34:42.870
And they'll do whatever
it takes to make as

00:34:42.870 --> 00:34:44.580
much money as possible.

00:34:44.580 --> 00:34:48.909
So what stands in the way
of them and hell?

00:34:48.909 --> 00:34:50.389
Well, the regulatory system.

00:34:50.389 --> 00:34:52.420
Which is why the regulatory
system has to be a lot

00:34:52.420 --> 00:34:54.385
simpler, so everybody
can understand it.

00:34:54.385 --> 00:34:55.810
Even we can understand it.

00:34:55.810 --> 00:34:57.490
And then, most importantly
perhaps, the politicians can

00:34:57.490 --> 00:34:58.840
understand it.

00:34:58.840 --> 00:35:01.800
And much tighter in terms
of the way it's policed.

00:35:07.220 --> 00:35:08.560
That's the question
of the decade.

00:35:08.560 --> 00:35:11.830
That's a good question.

00:35:11.830 --> 00:35:13.700
That was the fear, right?

00:35:13.700 --> 00:35:16.910
That's why Hank Paulson
did what he did.

00:35:16.910 --> 00:35:17.490
Think about this.

00:35:17.490 --> 00:35:20.290
This was a guy who came
from Goldman Sachs.

00:35:20.290 --> 00:35:24.060
He was the kind of person
who would never want to

00:35:24.060 --> 00:35:24.940
regulate the banks.

00:35:24.940 --> 00:35:26.210
Who would want to get out
of the way of the

00:35:26.210 --> 00:35:27.930
banks at all costs.

00:35:27.930 --> 00:35:31.550
And let them do what they do for
the good of the economy.

00:35:31.550 --> 00:35:33.900
And there he is basically
standing in in the way and

00:35:33.900 --> 00:35:36.360
saying, forget the
free market.

00:35:36.360 --> 00:35:37.460
Forget that.

00:35:37.460 --> 00:35:41.210
Forget all the principles of
Ayn Rand and all the rest.

00:35:41.210 --> 00:35:42.870
I'm going to stand here and I'm
going to catch these guys

00:35:42.870 --> 00:35:46.780
and cosset them like
a real Democrat.

00:35:46.780 --> 00:35:49.750
This was very, very unusual for
someone like that to be

00:35:49.750 --> 00:35:50.270
doing what he did.

00:35:50.270 --> 00:35:53.390
And the reason was because he
was afraid that the whole

00:35:53.390 --> 00:35:55.440
system would just come
crashing down.

00:35:55.440 --> 00:35:58.640
The way I describe it
in the book is--

00:35:58.640 --> 00:36:01.670
the analogy I use is like it's a
string of mountain climbers.

00:36:01.670 --> 00:36:04.400
They're all climbing up
a mountain together.

00:36:04.400 --> 00:36:06.550
And anyone who's done any
mountaineering knows that you

00:36:06.550 --> 00:36:07.820
rope yourselves together.

00:36:07.820 --> 00:36:09.540
You're all roped up.

00:36:09.540 --> 00:36:12.160
And the reason you do that is
because if one person falls,

00:36:12.160 --> 00:36:15.200
then you hope that the combined
weight of everybody

00:36:15.200 --> 00:36:18.450
else will actually stop that guy
or that woman from going

00:36:18.450 --> 00:36:19.950
over the edge, and they'll
be able to claw

00:36:19.950 --> 00:36:21.350
themselves back up.

00:36:21.350 --> 00:36:23.040
But what happened is--

00:36:23.040 --> 00:36:26.920
imagine now that one of these
banks is so enormous, or the

00:36:26.920 --> 00:36:29.810
precipice is so steep and the
ground is so treacherous, that

00:36:29.810 --> 00:36:32.900
when that person goes over the
edge, suddenly everybody's

00:36:32.900 --> 00:36:34.730
being pulled with them.

00:36:34.730 --> 00:36:36.260
And there's a real danger
that everybody's going

00:36:36.260 --> 00:36:37.540
to go over the edge.

00:36:37.540 --> 00:36:38.950
That's what Hank Paulson
was worried about.

00:36:38.950 --> 00:36:41.690
He was worried that Lehman
Brothers, because of the

00:36:41.690 --> 00:36:44.630
system of credit default swaps
that tied everybody together,

00:36:44.630 --> 00:36:46.950
and not just that but also the
way that the overnight banking

00:36:46.950 --> 00:36:49.560
system worked, and not just that
but the fact that if one

00:36:49.560 --> 00:36:51.920
bank goes, then no bank will
ever trust any other back

00:36:51.920 --> 00:36:54.200
again and suddenly the
system will freeze.

00:36:54.200 --> 00:36:56.030
He worried that it was just
going to drag the entire

00:36:56.030 --> 00:36:57.600
system over the cliff.

00:36:57.600 --> 00:37:00.440
And it was going to destroy
not just the American

00:37:00.440 --> 00:37:02.900
financial system, but the
global financial system.

00:37:02.900 --> 00:37:04.843
And he said the risks
were just too great.

00:37:04.843 --> 00:37:07.560
Now, if you speak to my father,
he'll say yes, we

00:37:07.560 --> 00:37:09.140
should have just let them go.

00:37:09.140 --> 00:37:11.760
And let the chips fall
where they may.

00:37:11.760 --> 00:37:14.767
But my dad lives in a little
cottage in Northern Ireland in

00:37:14.767 --> 00:37:15.860
the middle of nowhere
and doesn't depend

00:37:15.860 --> 00:37:16.920
on any of that stuff.

00:37:16.920 --> 00:37:18.310
He's retired.

00:37:18.310 --> 00:37:20.050
So it's all very well
for him to say that.

00:37:20.050 --> 00:37:22.440
But for those of us who are
still invested, and we all are

00:37:22.440 --> 00:37:25.340
if we have a retirement account,
if nothing else,

00:37:25.340 --> 00:37:28.540
that's a really, really
dangerous thing for us.

00:37:28.540 --> 00:37:31.570
If we work for a company that
needs the financial system in

00:37:31.570 --> 00:37:34.340
order to get business done,
whether it be to borrow money

00:37:34.340 --> 00:37:38.470
in order to buy property around
the world or to hire

00:37:38.470 --> 00:37:40.930
more people, or whether it be
because we have a company that

00:37:40.930 --> 00:37:47.040
invests in securities, our lives
are intricately tied in

00:37:47.040 --> 00:37:47.910
with the financial system.

00:37:47.910 --> 00:37:49.603
So there was real fear there.

00:37:49.603 --> 00:37:50.490
Now.

00:37:50.490 --> 00:37:51.410
2020 hindsight.

00:37:51.410 --> 00:37:55.000
If we'd let the banks go,
where would we be today?

00:37:55.000 --> 00:37:55.810
Maybe--

00:37:55.810 --> 00:37:58.860
if Goldman Sachs is to be
believed, they said that they

00:37:58.860 --> 00:38:00.360
had enough money that
they would be able

00:38:00.360 --> 00:38:01.210
to withstand that.

00:38:01.210 --> 00:38:04.530
So they would actually have a
good enough ice ax that they'd

00:38:04.530 --> 00:38:05.410
be able to sort of
hang on there.

00:38:05.410 --> 00:38:06.190
And they would have been OK.

00:38:06.190 --> 00:38:08.700
And eventually after a little
bit of freezing up, they would

00:38:08.700 --> 00:38:10.840
be able to claw themselves
back up again.

00:38:10.840 --> 00:38:12.110
JP Morgan said the same thing.

00:38:12.110 --> 00:38:13.620
Wells Fargo said
the same thing.

00:38:13.620 --> 00:38:16.200
So maybe what would've happened
is Lehman Brothers

00:38:16.200 --> 00:38:18.270
would have disappeared,
everything would have frozen

00:38:18.270 --> 00:38:21.770
solid for a couple of months,
but then people would've

00:38:21.770 --> 00:38:24.520
gradually sort of warmed up and
started lending to each

00:38:24.520 --> 00:38:25.040
other again.

00:38:25.040 --> 00:38:26.600
And things would
have improved.

00:38:26.600 --> 00:38:28.060
And it's a possibility.

00:38:28.060 --> 00:38:30.740
But making that call?

00:38:30.740 --> 00:38:33.890
I would not like to have been
in that room at the time.

00:38:33.890 --> 00:38:35.480
So the point was that
the financial system

00:38:35.480 --> 00:38:37.130
is inherently unstable.

00:38:37.130 --> 00:38:41.370
And perhaps what we need is a
new foundation, maybe, to--

00:38:41.370 --> 00:38:44.300
if I understand you correctly--
to recreate the

00:38:44.300 --> 00:38:46.630
fundamentals of the financial
service system.

00:38:46.630 --> 00:38:47.280
Maybe.

00:38:47.280 --> 00:38:48.910
That's certainly an argument
that I've heard

00:38:48.910 --> 00:38:51.390
made a number of times.

00:38:51.390 --> 00:38:57.210
I think that the reality is that
we're dealing with the

00:38:57.210 --> 00:39:00.730
trading of securities and the
way that you deal with money

00:39:00.730 --> 00:39:02.320
is inherently risky.

00:39:02.320 --> 00:39:05.650
People are always taking a risk
in order to get a reward.

00:39:05.650 --> 00:39:08.610
And we're part of the problem.

00:39:08.610 --> 00:39:11.050
The shareholder economy is part
of the problem, because

00:39:11.050 --> 00:39:15.720
people like us put our money
into investment funds, which

00:39:15.720 --> 00:39:19.220
then go to banks and say,
you'd better make money.

00:39:19.220 --> 00:39:20.850
Go to companies and say,
you better make money.

00:39:20.850 --> 00:39:24.550
It pushes those companies and
those banks to take risks.

00:39:24.550 --> 00:39:28.440
And unless you have a really
good foundation in which they

00:39:28.440 --> 00:39:32.330
can take risks, you're in
trouble, because they're going

00:39:32.330 --> 00:39:33.130
to fall through the floor.

00:39:33.130 --> 00:39:37.550
So I think that yes, the system
is not robust enough.

00:39:37.550 --> 00:39:39.220
Do we need a new system?

00:39:39.220 --> 00:39:39.860
I don't know.

00:39:39.860 --> 00:39:41.760
I think that the original
system that we

00:39:41.760 --> 00:39:43.050
had was pretty good.

00:39:43.050 --> 00:39:46.040
I think that the system they
designed after the Great

00:39:46.040 --> 00:39:48.860
Depression was pretty solid.

00:39:48.860 --> 00:39:50.580
We haven't maintained
it properly.

00:39:50.580 --> 00:39:53.030
Like I say, we punched a few
holes in it here and there.

00:39:53.030 --> 00:39:53.900
And that's a problem.

00:39:53.900 --> 00:39:57.380
So I think it needs to be
overhauled, but I don't think

00:39:57.380 --> 00:39:58.440
it needs to be replaced.

00:39:58.440 --> 00:40:01.790
But what I do think is that we
need to give mind to something

00:40:01.790 --> 00:40:03.380
that the Europeans are doing
much more often.

00:40:03.380 --> 00:40:05.100
You sound like you're
from Europe.

00:40:05.100 --> 00:40:05.540
OK.

00:40:05.540 --> 00:40:09.120
So what the Europeans are doing
is they're saying that

00:40:09.120 --> 00:40:11.390
there should be a almost a--
this is not specifically what

00:40:11.390 --> 00:40:12.590
they're saying, but they're
implying that there should be

00:40:12.590 --> 00:40:15.750
a morality clause built
into bank business.

00:40:15.750 --> 00:40:19.290
The banks should be required,
almost, to sign up to a sort

00:40:19.290 --> 00:40:24.400
of a morality charter that says,
you know what, we're

00:40:24.400 --> 00:40:25.730
part of society.

00:40:25.730 --> 00:40:28.190
Therefore, we should behave as
though we're part of society.

00:40:28.190 --> 00:40:29.540
Now, banks will tell you
here that that's what

00:40:29.540 --> 00:40:30.290
they already do.

00:40:30.290 --> 00:40:31.360
You know, we're part
of society.

00:40:31.360 --> 00:40:32.570
And we give money to charity.

00:40:32.570 --> 00:40:34.040
And this and that.

00:40:34.040 --> 00:40:34.910
And that's one thing.

00:40:34.910 --> 00:40:35.680
They'll say one thing.

00:40:35.680 --> 00:40:38.890
But I think that when you
actually see what they do--

00:40:38.890 --> 00:40:41.905
yes, of course, they are one of
the mainstays of society,

00:40:41.905 --> 00:40:44.910
but when it comes to actually
making money, that part of

00:40:44.910 --> 00:40:48.180
thinking about the rest of
us is not really part

00:40:48.180 --> 00:40:49.090
and parcel of that.

00:40:49.090 --> 00:40:51.610
They think about the rest of us
in the way that Adam Smith

00:40:51.610 --> 00:40:52.690
thinks about the rest of us.

00:40:52.690 --> 00:40:54.970
It's like enlightened
self interest.

00:40:54.970 --> 00:40:56.610
You drive, drive, drive
to make money.

00:40:56.610 --> 00:40:59.170
And that will therefore
blossom into good

00:40:59.170 --> 00:40:59.940
things down the line.

00:40:59.940 --> 00:41:04.140
Now, I think that that logic
only goes so far.

00:41:04.140 --> 00:41:06.950
Blocking out all morality
is a real problem.

00:41:06.950 --> 00:41:10.710
And I think that what we do need
is some kind of required

00:41:10.710 --> 00:41:14.645
structure for banks to invest
in on moral terms, so that

00:41:14.645 --> 00:41:16.060
they understand that they're
part of society.

00:41:16.060 --> 00:41:18.900
And they shouldn't be risking
all, because if they do, they

00:41:18.900 --> 00:41:21.880
will indeed risk all when
it comes to society too.

00:41:21.880 --> 00:41:24.610
[INAUDIBLE]?

00:41:24.610 --> 00:41:26.380
Ah, this includes
punishment, yes.

00:41:26.380 --> 00:41:28.340
Punishment.

00:41:28.340 --> 00:41:29.900
So we haven't seen much
punishment, have we?

00:41:29.900 --> 00:41:30.480
For the banks.

00:41:30.480 --> 00:41:32.960
And I know that's one of the
things that people get really,

00:41:32.960 --> 00:41:34.660
really upset about.

00:41:34.660 --> 00:41:37.530
And part of the reason for this
is because we have this

00:41:37.530 --> 00:41:40.950
poorly understood system that's
very poorly regulated.

00:41:40.950 --> 00:41:42.400
Or it's not poorly policed.

00:41:42.400 --> 00:41:46.060
So if you don't have a strong
system of rules that address

00:41:46.060 --> 00:41:49.400
themselves to every part of the
system and comprehend the

00:41:49.400 --> 00:41:52.260
system completely, how can
you have a punishment?

00:41:52.260 --> 00:41:55.190
Because wriggle out of it and
somebody says, well, we meant

00:41:55.190 --> 00:41:55.650
to do this.

00:41:55.650 --> 00:41:56.520
And it looks like this.

00:41:56.520 --> 00:41:59.130
And then the regulators are
completely bamboozled because

00:41:59.130 --> 00:42:00.480
they don't get it and haven't
been following it, haven't

00:42:00.480 --> 00:42:02.100
been paid to follow it
for long enough.

00:42:02.100 --> 00:42:03.940
And these people skate free.

00:42:03.940 --> 00:42:05.610
So yes, I think you're
absolutely right.

00:42:05.610 --> 00:42:07.160
We do need to have sanctions.

00:42:07.160 --> 00:42:09.790
But it's very, very difficult to
have sanctions in a system

00:42:09.790 --> 00:42:11.840
where even the police don't
really understand what the

00:42:11.840 --> 00:42:13.090
heck is going on.

00:42:17.011 --> 00:42:20.060
Well, I think that we do have
racketeering laws, of course.

00:42:20.060 --> 00:42:22.160
But then, those racketeering
laws were probably put

00:42:22.160 --> 00:42:25.390
together in the 1940s to deal
with the mafia, as opposed to

00:42:25.390 --> 00:42:29.662
having to deal with people
at an investment bank.

00:42:29.662 --> 00:42:32.520
And the other thing is, those
racketeering laws usually

00:42:32.520 --> 00:42:35.500
require-- and I'm not an expert
in this, but they

00:42:35.500 --> 00:42:38.060
usually require knowledge of
sort of a chain of command

00:42:38.060 --> 00:42:41.820
that actually wants you to do
something very, very specific.

00:42:41.820 --> 00:42:42.530
And then it happens.

00:42:42.530 --> 00:42:44.810
And then you can bring a case.

00:42:44.810 --> 00:42:47.810
In the case of the banks, these
people are empowered to

00:42:47.810 --> 00:42:48.550
just make money.

00:42:48.550 --> 00:42:50.980
It's like, guys, go and make
money the best way you can.

00:42:50.980 --> 00:42:51.870
You're smart guys.

00:42:51.870 --> 00:42:52.730
You figure it out.

00:42:52.730 --> 00:42:53.710
Get it done.

00:42:53.710 --> 00:42:55.690
And make sure that it remains
within the law.

00:42:55.690 --> 00:42:58.350
And as far as the law is
concerned, it does remain

00:42:58.350 --> 00:42:59.870
within the law.

00:42:59.870 --> 00:43:03.660
So it's all about your ability
to interpret whether or not

00:43:03.660 --> 00:43:05.360
the lines have been overstepped
in these cases.

00:43:05.360 --> 00:43:06.868
But you were going
to follow up.

00:43:10.500 --> 00:43:11.410
Well, here's the thing.

00:43:11.410 --> 00:43:16.920
So if they were selling
something to you and me,

00:43:16.920 --> 00:43:17.550
that's illegal.

00:43:17.550 --> 00:43:18.720
They can't do that.

00:43:18.720 --> 00:43:20.900
So if they're coming to us and
they're saying, you should buy

00:43:20.900 --> 00:43:23.100
this investment, it's great--
and people do

00:43:23.100 --> 00:43:25.400
go to jail for this.

00:43:25.400 --> 00:43:28.930
You have these unscrupulous
investment companies that will

00:43:28.930 --> 00:43:32.230
go to old ladies and retired
people, and they'll say, oh,

00:43:32.230 --> 00:43:33.050
you should really buy this.

00:43:33.050 --> 00:43:34.660
It's going to return
you 9% a year.

00:43:34.660 --> 00:43:35.510
Everything's going to be fine.

00:43:35.510 --> 00:43:36.940
And then the next thing,
it disappears in the

00:43:36.940 --> 00:43:38.120
twinkle of an eye.

00:43:38.120 --> 00:43:38.780
That's illegal.

00:43:38.780 --> 00:43:40.360
And people go to
jail for that.

00:43:40.360 --> 00:43:41.710
What we have in the
investment banking

00:43:41.710 --> 00:43:44.030
system is that you have--

00:43:44.030 --> 00:43:47.080
say, one investment bank will go
to another investment bank

00:43:47.080 --> 00:43:49.900
and say, you should
buy this product.

00:43:49.900 --> 00:43:51.340
This product is complete
rubbish.

00:43:51.340 --> 00:43:53.660
Put lipstick on that pig.

00:43:53.660 --> 00:43:55.030
They know that it's
a bad product.

00:43:55.030 --> 00:43:55.660
And what are they doing?

00:43:55.660 --> 00:43:58.000
Not only are they selling it to
that-- or they believe it's

00:43:58.000 --> 00:43:58.560
a bad product.

00:43:58.560 --> 00:44:00.490
They're not only selling it to
that person, to that other

00:44:00.490 --> 00:44:03.050
investment bank, but they're
also betting against it.

00:44:03.050 --> 00:44:05.360
They're saying, we think it's
so bad, we're actually going

00:44:05.360 --> 00:44:08.010
to bet against this thing.

00:44:08.010 --> 00:44:10.000
There's a concept in investment
banking called "big

00:44:10.000 --> 00:44:14.380
boy language." It
goes into all of

00:44:14.380 --> 00:44:15.470
these investing documents.

00:44:15.470 --> 00:44:18.140
So you get a bank loan-- if
you buy a piece of a bank

00:44:18.140 --> 00:44:20.320
loan, they put this thing in
called big boy language, and

00:44:20.320 --> 00:44:22.910
basically it's saying, you
and I are big boys.

00:44:22.910 --> 00:44:24.530
We know what's going on here.

00:44:24.530 --> 00:44:26.760
This thing could be complete
rubbish, but you're buying it

00:44:26.760 --> 00:44:28.960
on site and you know it could
be complete rubbish.

00:44:28.960 --> 00:44:30.780
But you're going to
buy it anyway.

00:44:30.780 --> 00:44:34.020
And once you've signed the big
boy language, there's nothing

00:44:34.020 --> 00:44:34.560
you can do.

00:44:34.560 --> 00:44:37.640
The investment bank who bought
it, and it went right into the

00:44:37.640 --> 00:44:40.190
toilet 10 seconds later,
can scream and howl

00:44:40.190 --> 00:44:41.490
as much as it wants.

00:44:41.490 --> 00:44:43.370
The other bank will just flick
this big boy language and say,

00:44:43.370 --> 00:44:44.460
look, here it is.

00:44:44.460 --> 00:44:45.750
You signed a paper.

00:44:45.750 --> 00:44:51.310
So the other point is that it's
kind of like gambling.

00:44:51.310 --> 00:44:54.400
If you make a bet on something,
somebody's got to

00:44:54.400 --> 00:44:55.630
take the other side
of the action.

00:44:55.630 --> 00:44:58.400
You go to a bookie and you make
a bet on a horse, the

00:44:58.400 --> 00:45:00.500
bookie's taking the other
side of that action.

00:45:00.500 --> 00:45:04.680
The same goes with
investment banks.

00:45:04.680 --> 00:45:05.910
They're making bets on things.

00:45:05.910 --> 00:45:07.540
And somebody else has to
take the other side.

00:45:07.540 --> 00:45:10.220
Somebody's got to sell you
something in order

00:45:10.220 --> 00:45:11.420
for you to buy it.

00:45:11.420 --> 00:45:13.250
So all they're saying
is, listen, we're

00:45:13.250 --> 00:45:14.440
selling you this thing.

00:45:14.440 --> 00:45:16.040
We may bet against it.

00:45:16.040 --> 00:45:17.440
Here's the big boy language.

00:45:17.440 --> 00:45:19.430
But they're like, OK,
we'll take it.

00:45:19.430 --> 00:45:22.190
We think it's going to do
better than you do.

00:45:22.190 --> 00:45:24.120
And we'll take our chances.

00:45:24.120 --> 00:45:27.780
So yes, on the face of it to
us, it sounds incredible.

00:45:27.780 --> 00:45:29.360
It sounds illegal.

00:45:29.360 --> 00:45:32.050
But in fact it's absolutely
legal and it's been happening

00:45:32.050 --> 00:45:33.300
for decades.

00:45:37.070 --> 00:45:40.460
Well, I think a lot of people
call taxing consumption--

00:45:40.460 --> 00:45:44.420
it's like a regressive tax,
because poor people--

00:45:44.420 --> 00:45:45.760
you've got to eat, right?

00:45:45.760 --> 00:45:49.555
So if you start taxing them
for pretty much everything

00:45:49.555 --> 00:45:51.620
that they consume,
then it really

00:45:51.620 --> 00:45:54.090
affects poor people more.

00:45:54.090 --> 00:45:56.840
This is a policy discussion
that I

00:45:56.840 --> 00:45:58.780
think happens ad infinitum.

00:45:58.780 --> 00:46:01.290
And has been happening
for a very long time.

00:46:01.290 --> 00:46:03.100
There are many societies
that put a--

00:46:03.100 --> 00:46:04.620
I think Singapore, for example,
has very high

00:46:04.620 --> 00:46:06.180
consumption tax.

00:46:06.180 --> 00:46:09.590
Here, we have relatively
low consumption tax.

00:46:09.590 --> 00:46:12.000
I think the UK now has
consumption tax.

00:46:12.000 --> 00:46:14.100
So I think most societies
are now doing

00:46:14.100 --> 00:46:15.650
something in between.

00:46:15.650 --> 00:46:19.760
But it's one of these
open questions.

00:46:19.760 --> 00:46:21.760
We could sit down and debate
it afterwards.

00:46:21.760 --> 00:46:24.130
But it would be a debate rather
than anything else.

00:46:24.130 --> 00:46:25.380
Yes.

00:46:28.056 --> 00:46:28.970
Oh, no.

00:46:28.970 --> 00:46:30.850
It wasn't empty.

00:46:30.850 --> 00:46:33.240
It wasn't really empty.

00:46:33.240 --> 00:46:34.820
So yes, this is a very
good question.

00:46:34.820 --> 00:46:38.370
So what we had is
virtual water.

00:46:38.370 --> 00:46:40.150
Here's the thing.

00:46:40.150 --> 00:46:43.710
The way the banking system works
is if I go to a bank and

00:46:43.710 --> 00:46:48.310
I put $100 into the
bank, there's a

00:46:48.310 --> 00:46:50.120
credit for me for $100.

00:46:50.120 --> 00:46:52.820
So say I'm a bank and
you give me $100.

00:46:52.820 --> 00:46:55.420
You've now got $100, but it
happens to be in the bank.

00:46:55.420 --> 00:46:57.260
I then have to keep,
say, 5% of that.

00:46:57.260 --> 00:46:58.750
So I keep $5 in the bank.

00:46:58.750 --> 00:47:02.400
And I can turn around and
I can lend you $95.

00:47:02.400 --> 00:47:07.210
So now there's $200
in the system.

00:47:07.210 --> 00:47:09.060
And then you can go and give
it to another bank.

00:47:09.060 --> 00:47:11.410
And suddenly we start to see
exponentially the amount of

00:47:11.410 --> 00:47:13.140
money that there is
in the system.

00:47:13.140 --> 00:47:15.150
A lot of this is just
notional money.

00:47:15.150 --> 00:47:18.880
Because there's only-- if you
came to me today and said, I

00:47:18.880 --> 00:47:21.520
want my $100 back,
I'd be like, OK.

00:47:21.520 --> 00:47:22.870
And I'd have to turn around
and borrow it

00:47:22.870 --> 00:47:24.180
from somebody else.

00:47:24.180 --> 00:47:28.450
And this is slightly away from
your question, but what

00:47:28.450 --> 00:47:30.130
happens in the banking
system is that this

00:47:30.130 --> 00:47:30.960
happens all the time.

00:47:30.960 --> 00:47:33.340
Banks run out of money.

00:47:33.340 --> 00:47:34.690
It sounds absurd, right?

00:47:34.690 --> 00:47:35.680
But they actually run
out of money.

00:47:35.680 --> 00:47:38.590
So they have to go to other
banks to borrow money.

00:47:38.590 --> 00:47:41.140
So say, for example, this is
what happened in Lehman

00:47:41.140 --> 00:47:42.070
Brothers-- well, no.

00:47:42.070 --> 00:47:43.680
That's not a good example
because Lehman Brothers was

00:47:43.680 --> 00:47:44.680
not a commercial bank.

00:47:44.680 --> 00:47:46.170
But say, for example,
I'm the bank.

00:47:46.170 --> 00:47:47.190
You want your money from me.

00:47:47.190 --> 00:47:48.300
I have to go to another bank.

00:47:48.300 --> 00:47:51.610
And that bank says to me, no.

00:47:51.610 --> 00:47:53.460
I'm not going to lend you
that money overnight.

00:47:53.460 --> 00:47:54.450
Because they usually do
it in what's called

00:47:54.450 --> 00:47:55.410
the overnight market.

00:47:55.410 --> 00:47:57.400
The bank says to me--

00:47:57.400 --> 00:47:59.160
J.P. Morgan says to me, I'm not
lending the Bank of Paddy

00:47:59.160 --> 00:48:02.780
Hirsch money overnight,
because I think you're

00:48:02.780 --> 00:48:05.610
invested in really
dodgy securities.

00:48:05.610 --> 00:48:06.080
What do you mean.

00:48:06.080 --> 00:48:08.170
Said, well, if you're invested
in bad securities, it means

00:48:08.170 --> 00:48:09.780
that you're not going to
be able to redeem those

00:48:09.780 --> 00:48:10.730
securities for any money.

00:48:10.730 --> 00:48:12.140
Which means you're not going
to be able to pay me

00:48:12.140 --> 00:48:13.550
back, let alone you.

00:48:13.550 --> 00:48:16.770
So suddenly I'm bust.

00:48:16.770 --> 00:48:17.840
Nobody's lending me any money.

00:48:17.840 --> 00:48:19.660
I owe you $95.

00:48:19.660 --> 00:48:20.990
I can give you $5.

00:48:20.990 --> 00:48:22.520
Sorry.

00:48:22.520 --> 00:48:23.950
But I'm bust.

00:48:23.950 --> 00:48:27.260
And that's really the root cause
of what happened when we

00:48:27.260 --> 00:48:29.600
were worried about the financial
system collapsing.

00:48:29.600 --> 00:48:31.570
It was the fact that these
banks would not

00:48:31.570 --> 00:48:32.440
lend to each other.

00:48:32.440 --> 00:48:34.950
And if banks stop lending to
each other, it's like you stop

00:48:34.950 --> 00:48:37.040
the flow of blood
around the body.

00:48:37.040 --> 00:48:38.780
And suddenly you have-- you know
what it's like when you

00:48:38.780 --> 00:48:41.320
stop blood flowing around a
body, is bits of the body

00:48:41.320 --> 00:48:41.950
start to drop off.

00:48:41.950 --> 00:48:45.250
They get gangrenous and horrible
and they fall off.

00:48:45.250 --> 00:48:48.270
So that's really what happened,
is the lifeblood

00:48:48.270 --> 00:48:50.690
started to slow down and
maybe even stop.

00:48:50.690 --> 00:48:55.120
And the urgency was keeping
that lifeblood going.

00:48:55.120 --> 00:48:56.790
But you had another question,
which was, where

00:48:56.790 --> 00:48:57.690
did that money go?

00:48:57.690 --> 00:49:00.070
Oh, yes, sorry.

00:49:00.070 --> 00:49:01.160
In the financial crisis.

00:49:01.160 --> 00:49:04.090
So what happened is, as people
get these credits in their

00:49:04.090 --> 00:49:07.300
account, they start behaving as
though that's real money.

00:49:07.300 --> 00:49:09.000
So suddenly you have all
this money stacking up.

00:49:09.000 --> 00:49:11.180
And if you've taken
all sorts of--

00:49:11.180 --> 00:49:12.410
if you've made bets
with people.

00:49:12.410 --> 00:49:13.380
And you've, say--

00:49:13.380 --> 00:49:15.000
this is what happened with these
credit default swaps.

00:49:15.000 --> 00:49:20.190
They'd made bets on peoples'
ability to pay a

00:49:20.190 --> 00:49:21.090
loan down the road.

00:49:21.090 --> 00:49:27.780
So say, for example, John has
bought a car, for example, and

00:49:27.780 --> 00:49:31.160
I want to bet that John's going
to crash his car within

00:49:31.160 --> 00:49:32.360
the next five years.

00:49:32.360 --> 00:49:33.310
I can take a bet with you.

00:49:33.310 --> 00:49:37.690
And I can pay you $5 a week
to take that action.

00:49:37.690 --> 00:49:40.760
So every week I'll pay you $5.

00:49:40.760 --> 00:49:44.270
And if John does crash his car,
then indeed, you pay me

00:49:44.270 --> 00:49:46.200
the entire worth
of John's car.

00:49:46.200 --> 00:49:46.660
So this is great.

00:49:46.660 --> 00:49:49.780
But what I can do is I can
register that as an asset.

00:49:49.780 --> 00:49:55.030
I can say I essentially
own the money that--

00:49:55.030 --> 00:49:56.270
so you can register
this as an asset.

00:49:56.270 --> 00:49:58.980
So what you had is all of this
financial shenanigans that

00:49:58.980 --> 00:50:05.110
allowed people to show all of
this income and this huge

00:50:05.110 --> 00:50:07.120
bottom line in their
bank accounts, and

00:50:07.120 --> 00:50:08.710
much of it was notional.

00:50:08.710 --> 00:50:11.100
It's kind of like when
you own a house and

00:50:11.100 --> 00:50:12.370
you value your house.

00:50:12.370 --> 00:50:13.310
And you say--

00:50:13.310 --> 00:50:15.640
you bought the house
for $300,000.

00:50:15.640 --> 00:50:17.160
Then the market jacks
up and now the

00:50:17.160 --> 00:50:19.090
house is worth $600,000.

00:50:19.090 --> 00:50:21.660
So you take the equity out
and then the house

00:50:21.660 --> 00:50:23.270
drops back down again.

00:50:23.270 --> 00:50:27.040
Well, that house was never
really worth $600,000.

00:50:27.040 --> 00:50:28.250
But yet, you've taken
the money out of it.

00:50:28.250 --> 00:50:29.990
And now your houses is under
water and you owe that money

00:50:29.990 --> 00:50:30.810
back in again.

00:50:30.810 --> 00:50:33.130
That's the kind of place where
all the money disappeared.

00:50:33.130 --> 00:50:37.360
It was this notional concept of
the value of certain assets

00:50:37.360 --> 00:50:39.740
that just disappeared whenever
the market dropped away.

00:50:39.740 --> 00:50:41.200
And that didn't just
happen in housing.

00:50:41.200 --> 00:50:44.370
That happened for cars
in many cases.

00:50:44.370 --> 00:50:46.340
It certainly happened for
credit default swaps.

00:50:46.340 --> 00:50:48.810
It happened for stocks
and shares and bonds.

00:50:48.810 --> 00:50:50.150
All sorts of assets.

00:50:50.150 --> 00:50:52.080
So this is what they call--

00:50:52.080 --> 00:50:54.145
this is where you hear the term
"frothy" in the market.

00:50:54.145 --> 00:50:57.500
It was just like froth
on the top of a beer.

00:50:57.500 --> 00:50:58.890
That froth looks great.

00:50:58.890 --> 00:50:59.970
The beer's this big.

00:50:59.970 --> 00:51:01.610
The froth just sort of
slowly goes down.

00:51:01.610 --> 00:51:03.430
And that's it.

00:51:03.430 --> 00:51:04.630
That's what happens.

00:51:04.630 --> 00:51:07.110
So it's all that froth that
we're talking about.

00:51:07.110 --> 00:51:08.810
So when people say, where
did all the money go?

00:51:08.810 --> 00:51:11.320
Well, the money didn't really
exist in the first place.

00:51:11.320 --> 00:51:12.791
It just looked like it did.

00:51:16.400 --> 00:51:17.710
Wow.

00:51:17.710 --> 00:51:18.960
Thanks for that.

00:51:21.970 --> 00:51:22.400
Yes.

00:51:22.400 --> 00:51:24.330
It is possible because we can't
use the gold standard.

00:51:24.330 --> 00:51:25.350
Yes.

00:51:25.350 --> 00:51:27.382
It's one of the downsides.

00:51:27.382 --> 00:51:28.740
Definitely.

00:51:28.740 --> 00:51:30.470
We're looking for a
happy medium, yes.

00:51:30.470 --> 00:51:32.280
I think everybody's looking
for a happy medium.

00:51:32.280 --> 00:51:35.960
But I think that really, with
the way the bubbles worked--

00:51:35.960 --> 00:51:37.260
and that's one of the things
about gold standard.

00:51:37.260 --> 00:51:39.195
They said, well, there were
never any bubbles when we had

00:51:39.195 --> 00:51:40.245
a gold standard.

00:51:40.245 --> 00:51:42.610
But that's not entirely true,
because you think of the--

00:51:42.610 --> 00:51:45.750
you may have heard of the tulip
bubble in the 1500s.

00:51:45.750 --> 00:51:47.500
And they have the gold
standard then.

00:51:47.500 --> 00:51:48.670
They had a bubble then.

00:51:48.670 --> 00:51:52.700
But it was a particular
asset, the value

00:51:52.700 --> 00:51:54.710
of these tulip bulbs.

00:51:54.710 --> 00:51:57.640
So it's not entirely true that
you don't have bubbles, but

00:51:57.640 --> 00:51:59.420
you probably get less of them
with the gold standard because

00:51:59.420 --> 00:52:01.010
you don't have the ability
to print money.

00:52:06.530 --> 00:52:08.220
Well, let's deal with
the 47% first.

00:52:08.220 --> 00:52:09.020
So yes.

00:52:09.020 --> 00:52:12.860
What's really interesting about
that statement is that a

00:52:12.860 --> 00:52:14.650
significant proportion
of the 47% are

00:52:14.650 --> 00:52:15.730
probably Republican voters.

00:52:15.730 --> 00:52:19.150
It just drives-- it amazes me.

00:52:19.150 --> 00:52:21.460
This falls into the same
rubric as the, get your

00:52:21.460 --> 00:52:24.070
government hands off my
Medicare comment.

00:52:24.070 --> 00:52:27.390
It's really interesting to hear
him say that, because a

00:52:27.390 --> 00:52:29.810
lot of those people
are retired.

00:52:29.810 --> 00:52:31.730
They're not paying
any income tax.

00:52:31.730 --> 00:52:34.310
And a lot of retired voters
vote Republican.

00:52:34.310 --> 00:52:38.740
So it's crazy that he would
make that statement.

00:52:38.740 --> 00:52:41.460
I watched the entire
video, or certainly

00:52:41.460 --> 00:52:42.250
right up to that point.

00:52:42.250 --> 00:52:45.310
So I know that he wasn't quoted
out of context there.

00:52:45.310 --> 00:52:48.310
That said, it's true.

00:52:48.310 --> 00:52:51.330
We have a system that
is open to abuse.

00:52:51.330 --> 00:52:53.500
And some people do abuse it.

00:52:53.500 --> 00:52:56.480
But I don't think 47% of the
population abuses it.

00:52:56.480 --> 00:52:59.110
Now, the question about the
amount of tax that--

00:52:59.110 --> 00:53:00.780
or how you can avoid the AMT.

00:53:00.780 --> 00:53:02.590
I mean, you'd have to speak to
a tax advisor about avoiding

00:53:02.590 --> 00:53:04.440
the AMT, which I'm sure you
could do if you're--

00:53:04.440 --> 00:53:05.790
AUDIENCE: But he's done it.

00:53:05.790 --> 00:53:08.690
PADDY HIRSCH: Well, he's done
it because he doesn't get

00:53:08.690 --> 00:53:09.743
income, you see.

00:53:09.743 --> 00:53:11.370
Not in the way that
we understand it.

00:53:11.370 --> 00:53:14.670
He has this thing called
carried interest.

00:53:14.670 --> 00:53:18.170
And what this is is if you are
a private equity fund--

00:53:18.170 --> 00:53:20.870
usually, we get paid a
paycheck every month.

00:53:20.870 --> 00:53:22.730
That's how it works for us.

00:53:22.730 --> 00:53:26.550
When you're in charge of a hedge
fund, what happens is

00:53:26.550 --> 00:53:27.540
you're making investments.

00:53:27.540 --> 00:53:30.840
So as the partner in a hedge
fund, it's almost as though

00:53:30.840 --> 00:53:32.500
you're just buying stocks
and shares.

00:53:32.500 --> 00:53:33.360
You're obviously buying
more than that.

00:53:33.360 --> 00:53:35.300
But it's like you're buying
stocks and shares.

00:53:35.300 --> 00:53:38.930
And then every month, you
get paid interest.

00:53:38.930 --> 00:53:41.150
So you get paid through
interest.

00:53:41.150 --> 00:53:46.190
But interest only gets
taxed at 15%.

00:53:46.190 --> 00:53:49.190
And carried interest only occurs
once every couple of

00:53:49.190 --> 00:53:50.680
years, because the way that--

00:53:50.680 --> 00:53:53.390
I mean, I'm sure most people
know about the venture capital

00:53:53.390 --> 00:53:54.450
market more than I do now.

00:53:54.450 --> 00:53:57.410
But the way a venture capital
works is that you only get

00:53:57.410 --> 00:54:02.320
paid out as an investor whenever
the exit from the

00:54:02.320 --> 00:54:03.680
investment occurs.

00:54:03.680 --> 00:54:05.880
So that could be like two,
three, five, seven

00:54:05.880 --> 00:54:07.070
years down the line.

00:54:07.070 --> 00:54:08.880
So a lot of the time this money
is coming in a lump sum,

00:54:08.880 --> 00:54:11.810
but it's still only
investment income.

00:54:11.810 --> 00:54:15.545
He's not being paid a check
monthly by his employer, by

00:54:15.545 --> 00:54:16.850
Bain Capital.

00:54:16.850 --> 00:54:19.180
So everything for him, all of
his money, comes in through

00:54:19.180 --> 00:54:19.610
investments.

00:54:19.610 --> 00:54:22.002
And the reason I think that--

00:54:22.002 --> 00:54:24.280
this is entirely subjective
on my part, but one of the

00:54:24.280 --> 00:54:26.690
reasons I think that the
Romney campaign was so

00:54:26.690 --> 00:54:29.160
reluctant to release this
information is not because

00:54:29.160 --> 00:54:29.960
there's anything
illegal in it--

00:54:29.960 --> 00:54:31.220
I think it's completely legal.

00:54:31.220 --> 00:54:34.060
I think the scary thing is what
you can get away with

00:54:34.060 --> 00:54:35.060
that's legal.

00:54:35.060 --> 00:54:36.230
I mean, it's, really?

00:54:36.230 --> 00:54:38.790
It's like, this is legal?

00:54:38.790 --> 00:54:39.550
It's totally legal.

00:54:39.550 --> 00:54:40.520
So he didn't do anything
illegal.

00:54:40.520 --> 00:54:45.610
But I think it's really kind of
a poke in the eye for the

00:54:45.610 --> 00:54:48.090
tax regime that you can get away
with this kind of thing.

00:54:48.090 --> 00:54:50.220
And I think a lot of
people think that

00:54:50.220 --> 00:54:51.360
it's extremely unfair.

00:54:51.360 --> 00:54:52.590
But that's really where
it comes into.

00:54:52.590 --> 00:54:56.590
It is investment income,
and not earned income,

00:54:56.590 --> 00:54:57.910
as you and I have.

00:54:57.910 --> 00:54:58.920
Can we afford Obamacare?

00:54:58.920 --> 00:55:00.990
Well, we're paying
for it right now.

00:55:00.990 --> 00:55:03.230
So we've got it right now.

00:55:03.230 --> 00:55:06.710
Actually, I think that what's
really interesting about the

00:55:06.710 --> 00:55:09.620
Romney plan and Obamacare as it
exists today, there's very

00:55:09.620 --> 00:55:11.330
little to choose between
them, frankly.

00:55:11.330 --> 00:55:16.970
I mean, everybody talks about
the great saving that the Ryan

00:55:16.970 --> 00:55:18.740
plan is going to make five years
down the road, which is

00:55:18.740 --> 00:55:20.820
exactly the great saving that
Obamacare is already

00:55:20.820 --> 00:55:21.460
making right now.

00:55:21.460 --> 00:55:24.930
So I think there's not much to
choose between the two plans.

00:55:24.930 --> 00:55:27.440
Whether or not we can
afford Obamacare--

00:55:27.440 --> 00:55:28.240
I actually don't think so.

00:55:28.240 --> 00:55:30.070
I think cuts are going to have
to be a lot deeper than they

00:55:30.070 --> 00:55:31.860
are right now.

00:55:31.860 --> 00:55:37.650
Just to keep the system funded
is going to be a problem.

00:55:37.650 --> 00:55:40.330
But to keep the system funded
and to pay down the deficit to

00:55:40.330 --> 00:55:42.510
some extent is going to be
really, really hard to do.

00:55:42.510 --> 00:55:44.540
And it's clear that they're
going to have to make deeper

00:55:44.540 --> 00:55:45.390
cuts than they've
made right now.

00:55:45.390 --> 00:55:47.370
They're going to be extremely
difficult to do politically.

00:55:47.370 --> 00:55:48.410
But they've got to be done.

00:55:48.410 --> 00:55:49.320
Otherwise, the system,
I think, is

00:55:49.320 --> 00:55:50.310
going to bust itself.

00:55:50.310 --> 00:55:52.770
So I think as it stands right
now, in the situation we're in

00:55:52.770 --> 00:55:53.880
right now, probably not.

00:55:53.880 --> 00:55:54.890
No, I don't think we could.

00:55:54.890 --> 00:55:58.820
So we're going to have to make
some cuts elsewhere.

00:55:58.820 --> 00:55:59.420
All right.

00:55:59.420 --> 00:56:00.280
Thank you all very
much indeed.

00:56:00.280 --> 00:56:01.370
I really appreciate it.

00:56:01.370 --> 00:56:02.620
Thank you.
