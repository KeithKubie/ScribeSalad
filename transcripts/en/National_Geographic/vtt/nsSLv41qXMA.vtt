00:00:37.136 --> 00:00:40.306
(applause)

00:00:41.374 --> 00:00:44.210
Thank you all for
coming out this evening.

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:47.213
It really is an honor
and pleasure to be here

00:00:47.213 --> 00:00:50.350
talking about
National Geographic,

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:55.055 line:0%
and in somewhat of a light
that maybe some of you

00:00:55.055 --> 00:00:57.257 line:0%
know about and maybe some
of you don't know about.

00:00:57.257 --> 00:00:59.826 line:0%
I mean everybody knows
about the golden rectangle

00:00:59.826 --> 00:01:02.061 line:0%
and about the<i> National
 Geographic magazine</i> .

00:01:02.061 --> 00:01:03.729 line:0%
Most of you know
about our channel

00:01:03.729 --> 00:01:06.365
and the fact that
through our media

00:01:06.365 --> 00:01:09.034
we reach almost four
hundred million souls

00:01:09.034 --> 00:01:10.303
around the world.

00:01:10.303 --> 00:01:12.838
It's incredible, it's
an honor to represent

00:01:12.838 --> 00:01:15.674
National Geographic
but it's also equally

00:01:15.674 --> 00:01:19.712
important to remember
that we are a funder

00:01:19.712 --> 00:01:24.550
of research and that we are
a player, we're proactive.

00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:29.055
Fredrik Hiebert: If we want
to tell the stories of people,

00:01:29.055 --> 00:01:33.059
places, cultures,
ecology, whales and lions

00:01:33.059 --> 00:01:35.428
and other things that
I don't deal with,

00:01:35.428 --> 00:01:36.696
we have to preserve that!

00:01:36.696 --> 00:01:39.732
We have to be able to
take care of our world

00:01:39.732 --> 00:01:43.469
so that future generations,
our kids and their kids

00:01:43.469 --> 00:01:45.638
will be able to turn
to National Geographic

00:01:45.638 --> 00:01:49.341
and have the same
stories to be told.

00:01:49.341 --> 00:01:51.076
You know, we have a very special

00:01:51.076 --> 00:01:55.781
thing with history and culture.

00:01:55.781 --> 00:01:59.285
It's very actually
different from you know

00:01:59.285 --> 00:02:03.589
biological world or oceans
and things like that.

00:02:03.589 --> 00:02:07.994
It's, the difference is
the culture, the past,

00:02:07.994 --> 00:02:13.099
the remains of our
history is nonrenewable.

00:02:13.099 --> 00:02:17.270
Like once a giant
Buddha is destroyed

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:19.005
it can't come back.

00:02:19.005 --> 00:02:20.406
It's gone!

00:02:20.406 --> 00:02:24.176
Once a site is destroyed
that little piece of history

00:02:24.176 --> 00:02:28.814
that piece of peoples'
identity is gone.

00:02:28.814 --> 00:02:29.882
You can't replace that

00:02:29.882 --> 00:02:33.619
And so, we become really
sort of focused on

00:02:33.619 --> 00:02:37.656
what can we do as a group,

00:02:37.656 --> 00:02:40.726
as a bunch of you know,
drummers in a band

00:02:40.726 --> 00:02:42.561
to get people so
that we can say,

00:02:42.561 --> 00:02:44.263
yeah, we can actually
do something.

00:02:44.263 --> 00:02:46.299
That's what this
evening is all about.

00:02:47.499 --> 00:02:50.669
Fredrik: When we look at
the world and certainly that's

00:02:50.669 --> 00:02:52.905
something that's
interesting about Geographic

00:02:52.905 --> 00:02:56.575
is that we do have
as our research arena

00:02:56.575 --> 00:02:57.810
all the continents of the world

00:02:57.810 --> 00:02:59.778
even Antarctica,
we don't have that.

00:02:59.778 --> 00:03:03.549
These circles here, these ovals

00:03:03.549 --> 00:03:06.919
are centers of civilization,

00:03:06.919 --> 00:03:10.989
centers of dense
archaeological finds.

00:03:10.989 --> 00:03:13.693
As you can see, you
know we're looking at

00:03:13.693 --> 00:03:16.195
something not on just
one continent or another.

00:03:16.195 --> 00:03:19.365
We're not gonna talk
about all of these.

00:03:19.365 --> 00:03:21.968
Tonight we're gonna look
at a few case examples.

00:03:21.968 --> 00:03:26.672
But when we look at the
whole issue of you know,

00:03:26.672 --> 00:03:30.342
how to keep cultures
and keep identities

00:03:30.342 --> 00:03:33.146
and artifacts where they belong.

00:03:33.146 --> 00:03:35.882
How is it that these
different cultures

00:03:35.882 --> 00:03:39.285
can become proud of
their role in part

00:03:39.285 --> 00:03:43.990
of human history in
defining humanity?

00:03:43.990 --> 00:03:46.359
It's huge, it's
almost unbelievable.

00:03:46.359 --> 00:03:48.894
When I work with
customs agents about

00:03:48.894 --> 00:03:50.763
what's coming
through the airports

00:03:50.763 --> 00:03:53.433
and what's coming
through our ports,

00:03:53.433 --> 00:03:55.235
its, you know I show
them this picture

00:03:55.235 --> 00:04:00.806
and I say, you have a
huge issue on your hands.

00:04:00.806 --> 00:04:04.344
You could have you know,
artifacts from the Andes

00:04:04.344 --> 00:04:07.146
just as easily as you can
have artifacts from Mali

00:04:07.146 --> 00:04:10.749
just as easily as you can have
artifacts from Afghanistan

00:04:10.749 --> 00:04:15.455
in a box being transported
away from its home.

00:04:15.455 --> 00:04:16.688
How are you gonna
deal with that?

00:04:16.688 --> 00:04:19.058
That's something which
is we're gonna talk

00:04:19.058 --> 00:04:22.261
about those kind of
interesting topics tonight.

00:04:22.261 --> 00:04:24.363
And we're gonna look at
a few of these areas.

00:04:24.363 --> 00:04:27.867
I call these
archaeological hot spots.

00:04:27.867 --> 00:04:29.968
And I'm happy to
tell you more about

00:04:29.968 --> 00:04:32.972
those archaeological hot
spots in discussion.

00:04:32.972 --> 00:04:35.040
But I'm gonna give
you a few examples.

00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:38.143
I'll give two,
Afghanistan and Peru
just to tell you

00:04:38.143 --> 00:04:41.547
a little bit about
approaches that we can have.

00:04:41.547 --> 00:04:45.651
Very positive approaches
that we can help

00:04:45.651 --> 00:04:48.888
to inspire these artifacts
and these cultures

00:04:48.888 --> 00:04:52.225
to remain alive in the
countries where they are.

00:04:52.225 --> 00:04:54.760
These are archaeologically
rich countries, right?

00:04:54.760 --> 00:04:56.828
All of them, all of
them have so many

00:04:56.828 --> 00:04:58.297
sites it's hard to count them.

00:04:58.297 --> 00:05:01.900
Afghanistan is famous for
its role on the Silk road,

00:05:01.900 --> 00:05:04.336
and we have artifacts
all over the place.

00:05:04.336 --> 00:05:07.540
I think this was the
first country where we

00:05:07.540 --> 00:05:09.742
had sort of an
international recognition

00:05:09.742 --> 00:05:13.046
for a country's
cultural heritage

00:05:13.046 --> 00:05:15.381
for something that we
wish really didn't happen.

00:05:15.381 --> 00:05:18.817
This is a giant Buddha
in the Bamiyan Valley.

00:05:18.817 --> 00:05:21.720
Huge, over a hundred feet tall,

00:05:21.720 --> 00:05:25.691
incredible built in the sixth,

00:05:25.691 --> 00:05:28.060
or seventh, or
eighth century A.D.

00:05:28.060 --> 00:05:29.428
It's been famous.

00:05:29.428 --> 00:05:31.430
It was a tourist attraction.

00:05:31.430 --> 00:05:35.434
And many of you remember
when it was destroyed.

00:05:35.434 --> 00:05:40.206
Fredrik: That sort of culture
destruction cannot be replaced.

00:05:40.206 --> 00:05:43.008
And it, for the
first time focused

00:05:43.008 --> 00:05:44.676
international
attention on you know,

00:05:44.676 --> 00:05:45.978
the center of the
Silk road and say,

00:05:45.978 --> 00:05:48.181
oh my goodness we
didn't really realize

00:05:48.181 --> 00:05:50.315
that culture was a
big factor in this.

00:05:50.315 --> 00:05:51.650
And I think when it was on the

00:05:51.650 --> 00:05:53.152
front pages of the
<i> New York Times,</i>

00:05:53.152 --> 00:05:54.921
when it was on the pages
of the<i> National Geographic</i>

00:05:54.921 --> 00:05:57.089
when you saw this
on CNN you realize,

00:05:57.089 --> 00:06:00.660
oh, this is important.

00:06:02.060 --> 00:06:03.629
At the same time
people have to realize

00:06:03.629 --> 00:06:09.101
that fragility of culture
wasn't just at Pompeion.

00:06:09.101 --> 00:06:10.536
This is two thousand
and three when I

00:06:10.536 --> 00:06:12.905
first saw the National
Museum of Afghanistan.

00:06:12.905 --> 00:06:15.174
This is the museum.

00:06:15.174 --> 00:06:21.381
No roof, no windows and
inside, no artifacts.

00:06:22.981 --> 00:06:25.918
I went there on behalf
of<i> National Geographic</i>

00:06:25.918 --> 00:06:28.020
magazine to sort of
write a post script

00:06:28.020 --> 00:06:31.056
about what I thought
was a tragedy,

00:06:31.056 --> 00:06:33.859
something that people
should know about.

00:06:33.859 --> 00:06:35.828
But something else happened,
okay.

00:06:35.828 --> 00:06:38.331
I went to the museum, all
the way to Afghanistan.

00:06:38.331 --> 00:06:40.666
I had never actually been
to Afghanistan before

00:06:40.666 --> 00:06:43.269
even though I had
written about it.

00:06:43.269 --> 00:06:45.904
I had written reports
in archaeology magazines.

00:06:45.904 --> 00:06:47.306
I wrote my dissertation on it.

00:06:47.306 --> 00:06:48.474
It was sort of like,
I never thought

00:06:48.474 --> 00:06:49.941
I was going to Afghanistan.

00:06:49.941 --> 00:06:51.610
And I went and I talked to the

00:06:51.610 --> 00:06:56.014
museum director, this
man Omara Khan Massoudi.

00:06:56.014 --> 00:06:59.451
He's one of my cultural
heroes this evening is about.

00:06:59.451 --> 00:07:02.721
And I said, "What do I say about

00:07:02.721 --> 00:07:05.291
the treasures of Afghanistan?"

00:07:05.291 --> 00:07:07.359
And he said, well you
know the treasures

00:07:07.359 --> 00:07:10.829
of the National Museum
meant a lot to us

00:07:10.829 --> 00:07:12.764
and you know before the museum

00:07:12.764 --> 00:07:15.534
was destroyed we hid them away.

00:07:15.534 --> 00:07:19.505
Well, he said that's a
secret but I'm telling you.

00:07:19.505 --> 00:07:22.174
And we ended up doing
something that we never

00:07:22.174 --> 00:07:24.744
expected to do at
National Geographic.

00:07:24.744 --> 00:07:27.680
We sponsored
an inventory of the

00:07:27.680 --> 00:07:29.415
hidden collections
of Afghanistan.

00:07:29.415 --> 00:07:31.417
This is one of the pieces.

00:07:31.417 --> 00:07:33.852
We put all these
things on inventory,

00:07:33.852 --> 00:07:35.755
computerized, digital images

00:07:35.755 --> 00:07:39.225
and we created a passport
for these objects.

00:07:39.225 --> 00:07:41.426
That meant that
now these objects

00:07:41.426 --> 00:07:43.296
were visible to the whole world

00:07:43.296 --> 00:07:46.732
and could never actually
be sold or marketed again.

00:07:46.732 --> 00:07:49.568
Kind of squashing a
market for these objects.

00:07:49.568 --> 00:07:53.271
It also lead to the
Bactrian Gold exhibition.

00:07:53.271 --> 00:07:54.706
They're feeling of sense of self

00:07:54.706 --> 00:07:56.341
about this within Afghanistan.

00:07:56.341 --> 00:08:01.480
A sense of great honor and
sort of cultural heritage

00:08:01.480 --> 00:08:03.182
that they hadn't
seen for 30 years.

00:08:03.182 --> 00:08:04.683
And that's a really
positive thing

00:08:04.683 --> 00:08:07.887
that came out of working
together on that.

00:08:09.021 --> 00:08:11.690
There are other problems
and we continue to work

00:08:11.690 --> 00:08:14.726
with the Afghans on
issues on what happens

00:08:14.726 --> 00:08:17.630
during the situation
when sites are looted.

00:08:17.630 --> 00:08:20.966
This is actually
not an excavation.

00:08:20.966 --> 00:08:23.335
These are people
who are just digging

00:08:23.335 --> 00:08:25.571
for treasures in Afghanistan.

00:08:25.571 --> 00:08:28.474
And it hurts me to
look at this picture.

00:08:28.474 --> 00:08:31.510
My friend who excavated
the Bactrian Gold,

00:08:31.510 --> 00:08:33.912
he took this picture
and here's a picture

00:08:33.912 --> 00:08:35.714
of where those
artifacts ended up.

00:08:35.714 --> 00:08:38.985
That's the marketplace in Kabul.

00:08:38.985 --> 00:08:42.587
I can't tell you how many
four thousand year old

00:08:42.587 --> 00:08:44.056
burials this represents 'cause

00:08:44.056 --> 00:08:46.158
it's impossible
for me to say that.

00:08:46.158 --> 00:08:48.793
But each one of those
vessels represents

00:08:48.793 --> 00:08:51.831
a piece of culture which is out,

00:08:51.831 --> 00:08:56.735
and about to be sent abroad
for pennies on each piece.

00:08:56.735 --> 00:08:57.436
(stutters)

00:08:57.669 --> 00:09:00.539
It's tragic from a
personal point of view,

00:09:00.539 --> 00:09:01.940
from an Afghan point of view

00:09:01.940 --> 00:09:04.310
and from a world
point of view to see.

00:09:04.310 --> 00:09:06.879
That's a whole chapter
of history right there.

00:09:07.579 --> 00:09:10.182
So we do, do things
and I am pleased

00:09:10.182 --> 00:09:12.351
to say that work
with U.S. Customs.

00:09:12.351 --> 00:09:13.785
We work with UNESCO.

00:09:13.785 --> 00:09:16.856
We work with culture,
with groups around the world.

00:09:16.856 --> 00:09:20.726
And one of the things
that we do is we help.

00:09:20.726 --> 00:09:22.661
For example, this
is U.S. Customs.

00:09:22.661 --> 00:09:28.200
This is a shipment of
illegally transported artifacts

00:09:28.200 --> 00:09:30.402
that thanks to
collaboration between

00:09:30.402 --> 00:09:31.970
the U.S. government
and the governments

00:09:31.970 --> 00:09:33.706
around the world
including Afghanistan

00:09:33.706 --> 00:09:36.508
and Peru and quite
a few countries.

00:09:36.508 --> 00:09:39.411
We're able to say,
look these pieces

00:09:39.411 --> 00:09:43.048
belong in a home and
they can be sent back.

00:09:43.048 --> 00:09:46.618
And we're so pleased to be
able to say that repatriations

00:09:46.618 --> 00:09:49.355
are an important part
of what we do here

00:09:49.355 --> 00:09:51.557
at National Geographic,
here in Washington DC.

00:09:51.557 --> 00:09:52.758
And the United
States is a really

00:09:52.758 --> 00:09:54.427
good partner is
doing these things.

00:09:54.427 --> 00:09:56.428
And I think it's
a fantastic thing

00:09:56.428 --> 00:09:58.997
that you should all know about.

00:09:58.997 --> 00:10:00.232
Let's turn quickly
to my second

00:10:00.232 --> 00:10:01.800
example, which is Peru.

00:10:01.800 --> 00:10:03.735
So we've moved continents.

00:10:03.735 --> 00:10:06.471
This is a Peruvian pyramid.

00:10:06.471 --> 00:10:08.707
Sometimes hard to see so I put

00:10:08.707 --> 00:10:10.609
a little drawing
of a pyramid to say,

00:10:10.609 --> 00:10:12.444
hey look, you know this
is just like Egypt.

00:10:12.444 --> 00:10:14.947
You're gonna see some
pictures of pyramids later.

00:10:14.947 --> 00:10:16.315
You know you've got pyramids

00:10:16.315 --> 00:10:18.884
that are known from the
Mayan area from Egypt,

00:10:18.884 --> 00:10:21.754
but believe me
they're in Peru too.

00:10:21.754 --> 00:10:26.859
But pyramids attract the
attention of looters.

00:10:26.859 --> 00:10:29.762
And things from those
pyramids have been

00:10:29.762 --> 00:10:32.931
on sale in the market
for a long, long time.

00:10:32.931 --> 00:10:35.500
This is a piece
from the exhibition

00:10:35.500 --> 00:10:37.636
that was on the market in Italy.

00:10:37.636 --> 00:10:40.138
We were so pleased
when the ambassador

00:10:40.138 --> 00:10:42.774
from Peru asked the
president of Italy,

00:10:42.774 --> 00:10:44.776
that's him in the front,

00:10:44.776 --> 00:10:48.280
please return this piece of
Peruvian culture and they did.

00:10:48.280 --> 00:10:50.349
And it was like ancient Rome

00:10:50.349 --> 00:10:52.684
returning something
to ancient Peru.

00:10:52.684 --> 00:10:53.852
I would've thought that,

00:10:53.852 --> 00:10:55.654
that's kind of a
cool concept right?

00:10:55.654 --> 00:10:57.823
We're really pleased
but you know it sat

00:10:57.823 --> 00:10:59.291
for many years as
being kind of like,

00:10:59.291 --> 00:11:01.460
okay, that's a large
cool mask, right?

00:11:01.460 --> 00:11:02.394
What does it mean?

00:11:02.394 --> 00:11:03.829
And you know without the context

00:11:03.829 --> 00:11:06.899
of knowing what it is, it
was a little enigmatic.

00:11:06.899 --> 00:11:10.302
Still very cool but
having the objects

00:11:10.302 --> 00:11:13.639
in a database that
can be presented

00:11:13.639 --> 00:11:16.775
to anybody as, you
know around the world.

00:11:16.775 --> 00:11:21.279
This is the
Larco Museum in Peru,
which is a model.

00:11:21.279 --> 00:11:23.548
The director of the
Larco Museum was here.

00:11:23.548 --> 00:11:25.684
He has a collection of
45 thousand objects.

00:11:25.684 --> 00:11:28.087
You can visit every single
one of these objects

00:11:28.087 --> 00:11:29.988
in high resolution
because every single

00:11:29.988 --> 00:11:32.658
object in their
collection is on the web.

00:11:32.658 --> 00:11:34.726
I think that's fantastic!

00:11:34.726 --> 00:11:36.127
We don't have museums in the

00:11:36.127 --> 00:11:37.495
United States that have that.

00:11:37.495 --> 00:11:41.600
And our best example
comes from Lima, Peru.

00:11:41.600 --> 00:11:43.235
If you look very
carefully we have

00:11:43.235 --> 00:11:46.438
a piece that was
stolen from Peru,

00:11:46.438 --> 00:11:48.340
was returned by U.S. Customs.

00:11:48.340 --> 00:11:51.109
It was at the Peruvian
embassy and they said

00:11:51.109 --> 00:11:52.611
would you please
put this on display?

00:11:52.611 --> 00:11:55.080
And I was like, oh
my God, that's huge.

00:11:55.080 --> 00:11:59.051
And this piece has been
stolen twice from Peru.

00:11:59.051 --> 00:12:00.552
'Cause the market is
so high for them.

00:12:00.552 --> 00:12:02.254
We're trying to
reduce that market.

00:12:02.254 --> 00:12:04.823
This piece, after
the exhibition will

00:12:04.823 --> 00:12:07.493
be going back to Peru,
to its right home.

00:12:08.460 --> 00:12:12.464
Peru is a nice example
because this is using drones

00:12:12.464 --> 00:12:14.967
to document
archaeological sites in Peru.

00:12:14.967 --> 00:12:17.602
We really are, you know
it's not just archaeologist

00:12:17.602 --> 00:12:20.773
as Indiana Jones with
a shovel and a whip.

00:12:20.773 --> 00:12:22.707
We use drones, we
use satellites.

00:12:22.707 --> 00:12:27.445
We use best technology
available to help us understand

00:12:27.445 --> 00:12:30.682
and preserve cultures
for the world.

00:12:30.682 --> 00:12:33.551 line:0%
Omara Massoudi: A nation
stays alive.

00:12:33.551 --> 00:12:37.255 line:0%
When its culture, stays alive.

00:12:37.255 --> 00:12:40.259
Omara: Our people should
know what happened.

00:12:40.259 --> 00:12:41.961
They should know
about their culture

00:12:41.961 --> 00:12:44.363
about their history.

00:12:44.363 --> 00:12:46.098
That is true for every

00:12:46.098 --> 00:12:47.766
culture around the world.

00:12:47.766 --> 00:12:49.001
They should know
about their culture.

00:12:49.001 --> 00:12:50.569
They should know
about their history.

00:12:50.569 --> 00:12:53.305
It's a win, win
situation for everybody.

00:12:54.206 --> 00:12:55.541
We need
to do the inventory of

00:12:55.541 --> 00:12:58.310
the collections and sites.

00:12:58.310 --> 00:13:01.580
We need to help with
the repatriations.

00:13:01.580 --> 00:13:03.248
And we need to
get people excited

00:13:03.248 --> 00:13:04.683
about visiting these countries

00:13:04.683 --> 00:13:06.652
where they come
from, like Egypt.

00:13:06.652 --> 00:13:08.921
Thank you very much.

00:13:08.921 --> 00:13:11.122
