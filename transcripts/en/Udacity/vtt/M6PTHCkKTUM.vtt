Because of the severity of the symptoms associated with schizophrenia, there's

00:00:03.357 --> 00:00:08.430
been a great deal of research to look at the causes for this disorder. And we

00:00:08.430 --> 00:00:11.994
can see clearly from the research that schizophrenia is both a fascinating yet

00:00:11.994 --> 00:00:15.504
tragic disorder that is a result of the dynamic interplay between both nature

00:00:15.504 --> 00:00:20.854
and nurture. Let's take a look at how these two forces work together to produce

00:00:20.854 --> 00:00:26.168
schizophrenia. The major model looking at the interplay of nature and nurture

00:00:26.168 --> 00:00:30.980
in the development of schizophrenia is called the diathesis-stress model. Let's

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:32.729
go to Greg to learn a little bit more about this.
