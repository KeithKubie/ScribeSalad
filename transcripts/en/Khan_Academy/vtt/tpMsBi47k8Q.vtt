00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:02.410
- [Instructor] Two terms
that you've likely heard

00:00:02.410 --> 00:00:05.560
in the context of government
spending and budgets

00:00:05.560 --> 00:00:10.000
and borrowing are the
terms deficit and debt.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:11.840
And they can get a little bit confusing

00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:14.740
because they're associated
with borrowing and budgets

00:00:14.740 --> 00:00:17.590
and spending and they both start with D.

00:00:17.590 --> 00:00:21.520
And they are related but
they mean different things.

00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:25.910
A deficit is a situation
where you spend more

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:27.680
than you are taking in.

00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:30.050
So from a government point of view,

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:33.190
this would be a situation
where a government spends more,

00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:37.710
in a year than they take
in, in revenue in that year.

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:42.710
So in a year, or budgetary cycle

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:47.670
spending more, spending more

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:50.140
than taking in.

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:51.220
And that difference,

00:00:51.220 --> 00:00:54.610
the amount that you are
over spending that year

00:00:54.610 --> 00:00:57.930
is going to be a deficit.

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:01.310
A debt on the other
hand is the total amount

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:02.500
that you owe.

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:07.500
So total amount, amount owed.

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:10.050
Now these are clearly related.

00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:12.440
Let's say in, let me make a,

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:15.160
a hypothetical government here.

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:19.010
So let's say year one, year two,

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:23.530
year three, year four and
I'll go up to year five.

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:26.143
And let's think about the deficit,

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:28.550
the deficit each year

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:31.170
and let's think about the debt each year.

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:35.020
So let's say in year one
our hypothetical country,

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:37.760
we overspend by 200,

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:40.530
I'll do everything in billions of dollars.

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:44.260
So we overspend by 200 billion dollars.

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:47.270
We run a 200 billion dollar deficit.

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:50.200
Well assuming that the
debt was zero before that,

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:54.220
we're now going to owe
people 200 billion dollars.

00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:56.790
I'm assuming everything
here is in billions.

00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:58.500
Alright, so let's say that next year,

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:03.500
we run a deficit of a
hundred billion dollars.

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:07.410
Well now we owe the
money that we owed before

00:02:07.410 --> 00:02:09.510
plus another hundred billion dollars.

00:02:09.510 --> 00:02:12.880
So this would be 300 billion

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:14.860
and then you could see where this goes.

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:18.200
If in year three we run another deficit

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:21.630
of let's say, let's say
we spend a lot this year.

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:23.170
A lot more than we take in,

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:25.770
so we have a deficit of 500 billion.

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:27.780
Well then that will just add to our debt.

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:30.870
So that's now going to be 800 billion

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:32.800
and of course you can pay down debt.

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:34.080
In order to pay down debt

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:36.300
you would run a surplus in a year

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:38.940
which you could view
as a negative deficit.

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:43.650
So let's say that this
year it's negative 100.

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:45.370
So normally people wouldn't say

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:48.940
this is a negative 100
billion dollar deficit.

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:50.410
Normally they would
say that the government

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:53.690
ran a 100 billion dollar surplus

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:55.410
but let's say they run that surplus,

00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:56.950
they pay down the debt.

00:02:56.950 --> 00:02:59.060
Well so now, they would pay it down,

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:01.530
so now we're at, we owe 700 billion

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:03.290
and of course you could have a year

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:05.620
where you have a
completely balanced budget.

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:07.970
You're not running a surplus or a deficit

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:11.470
and in that case your
debt would stay the same.

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:13.840
Now some of y'all might be
wondering about the interest

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:15.260
but the interest on the debt,

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:16.930
that'd be part of the budget.

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:19.280
So we thought about that
already on whether we're running

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:20.673
a surplus or a deficit.

00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:23.320
To make this a little bit more clear

00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:25.390
in the context of the United States

00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:29.910
here is a chart that shows the
total deficits and surpluses

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:32.630
for the United States from the late 1960's

00:03:32.630 --> 00:03:34.850
all the way to near the present time

00:03:34.850 --> 00:03:36.620
but then it projects out a decade

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:37.660
and these projections,

00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:39.620
you should always take
with a grain of a salt.

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:41.870
Whenever these bars are going downwards

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:43.130
those are years in which

00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:45.040
our government is running a deficit.

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:47.140
The years where we are above the line,

00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:50.040
those are where we are
running a budget surplus,

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:52.280
where the government actually took in more

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:53.690
than it spent.

00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:56.440
So big picture, deficits and surpluses

00:03:56.440 --> 00:03:59.580
are talking about how much
you are over or underspending

00:03:59.580 --> 00:04:00.710
in a given year

00:04:00.710 --> 00:04:03.440
while debts are talking
about your accumulated amount

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:04.273
that you owe

00:04:04.273 --> 00:04:05.930
and to make that clear

00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:08.720
we can take a look at
the total public debt

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:10.740
in the United States and this once again,

00:04:10.740 --> 00:04:15.320
goes from the 1970's all
the way to near the present.

00:04:15.320 --> 00:04:17.090
And you can see that the debt

00:04:17.090 --> 00:04:19.870
has accumulated in a pretty big way.

00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:22.400
It's approaching, this says 20 million

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:23.233
but you have to look at this.

00:04:23.233 --> 00:04:24.810
It says millions of dollars.

00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:27.270
So this is 20 million million

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:31.310
or 20 trillion dollars of debt.

00:04:31.310 --> 00:04:34.110
This is how much the United
States Government owes

00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:35.357
but some of you might argue that

00:04:35.357 --> 00:04:38.077
"Hey look, the economy
has grown a good bit.

00:04:38.077 --> 00:04:40.677
"So what really matters
is how much do you owe

00:04:40.677 --> 00:04:43.400
"as a percent of GDP?"

00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:46.450
So this shows as a percentage of GDP,

00:04:46.450 --> 00:04:48.250
it's not quite as dramatic

00:04:48.250 --> 00:04:50.860
but our government debt is now about equal

00:04:50.860 --> 00:04:53.170
to our annual GDP.

00:04:53.170 --> 00:04:56.100
So if you were to make an
analogy to your personal life,

00:04:56.100 --> 00:04:59.660
if you say made, $100,000 in a year

00:04:59.660 --> 00:05:04.530
this is like having also $100,000 of debt.

00:05:04.530 --> 00:05:06.630
Now an interesting question is,

00:05:06.630 --> 00:05:11.630
what are the pros and the cons

00:05:11.890 --> 00:05:14.380
of running a deficit in a given year?

00:05:14.380 --> 00:05:17.430
Which is going to add to the debt.

00:05:17.430 --> 00:05:19.780
Well some of the arguments in favor

00:05:19.780 --> 00:05:21.770
of sometimes running a deficit

00:05:21.770 --> 00:05:23.990
which will add to the debt

00:05:23.990 --> 00:05:26.390
is that it allows a government to do

00:05:26.390 --> 00:05:29.070
counter-cyclical fiscal policy,

00:05:29.070 --> 00:05:33.436
or if you're into a recession,
to have an expansionary,

00:05:33.436 --> 00:05:37.402
expansionary fiscal policy

00:05:37.402 --> 00:05:39.740
which we've talked about in other videos

00:05:39.740 --> 00:05:42.390
often involves maybe lowering taxes

00:05:42.390 --> 00:05:44.160
and increasing spending

00:05:44.160 --> 00:05:46.070
and that could allow the government

00:05:46.070 --> 00:05:49.210
to maybe make a recession less severe

00:05:49.210 --> 00:05:52.050
which might allow everyone to
be better off in the long run

00:05:52.050 --> 00:05:54.420
and these things are all debated.

00:05:54.420 --> 00:05:57.560
Now the cons are easier to think of.

00:05:57.560 --> 00:05:59.960
One could imagine that at some point

00:05:59.960 --> 00:06:02.120
the debt becomes unsustainable.

00:06:02.120 --> 00:06:06.540
Debt unsustainable and
there are definitely

00:06:06.540 --> 00:06:08.410
examples of other countries

00:06:08.410 --> 00:06:10.540
that have run such large debts

00:06:10.540 --> 00:06:13.070
that they could not even
service the interest.

00:06:13.070 --> 00:06:15.670
Just remember whether
it's just you individually

00:06:15.670 --> 00:06:17.330
or a government, when you borrow money

00:06:17.330 --> 00:06:18.950
you have pay interest.

00:06:18.950 --> 00:06:20.520
At some point the interest could become

00:06:20.520 --> 00:06:23.400
so significant that the
government can no longer

00:06:23.400 --> 00:06:24.830
afford to pay it.

00:06:24.830 --> 00:06:28.530
And even if a government can
pay the interest on the debt

00:06:28.530 --> 00:06:30.210
that money that's being used for interest

00:06:30.210 --> 00:06:33.910
could have otherwise been
used for other things.

00:06:33.910 --> 00:06:37.500
Another con of running large deficits

00:06:37.500 --> 00:06:40.630
which could lead to
large accumulated debts

00:06:40.630 --> 00:06:42.300
is that it can affect interest rates

00:06:42.300 --> 00:06:43.740
in the broader market.

00:06:43.740 --> 00:06:46.140
So you could lead to an increase,

00:06:46.140 --> 00:06:49.963
increase in interest rates.

00:06:50.910 --> 00:06:53.840
Interest rates.

00:06:53.840 --> 00:06:55.410
When we studied the money market

00:06:55.410 --> 00:06:56.960
we would see that hey,

00:06:56.960 --> 00:06:59.040
the more that the government is out there

00:06:59.040 --> 00:07:00.570
trying to borrow money,

00:07:00.570 --> 00:07:02.900
that's goIng to shift
demand in the money markets

00:07:02.900 --> 00:07:03.950
to the right

00:07:03.950 --> 00:07:06.240
and if the interest rates increase

00:07:06.240 --> 00:07:07.370
that could lead to,

00:07:07.370 --> 00:07:08.930
what we've talked about before,

00:07:08.930 --> 00:07:10.670
the idea of crowding out.

00:07:10.670 --> 00:07:12.300
Or the crowding out effect

00:07:12.300 --> 00:07:14.720
where because of increased interest rates,

00:07:14.720 --> 00:07:16.610
fewer potential private borrowers

00:07:16.610 --> 00:07:18.480
are gonna go and borrow money

00:07:18.480 --> 00:07:21.850
which they might use to
go out and invest things.

00:07:21.850 --> 00:07:24.130
So those are, these are
all very interesting things

00:07:24.130 --> 00:07:26.440
to think about but the big takeaway here

00:07:26.440 --> 00:07:30.180
is to not get confused
between deficit and debt.

00:07:30.180 --> 00:07:32.699
Deficits and surplus
refer to how much you are

00:07:32.699 --> 00:07:35.690
over or underspending in a given year.

00:07:35.690 --> 00:07:38.243
Debt is the total amount you owe.
