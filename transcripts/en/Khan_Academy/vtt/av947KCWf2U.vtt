00:00:00.624 --> 00:00:01.442
- [Voiceover] We already have a lot

00:00:01.442 --> 00:00:03.722
of experience with the geometric series.

00:00:03.956 --> 00:00:06.577
For example, if I have the
infinite geometric series

00:00:07.101 --> 00:00:11.406
starting at N equals K to
infinity of R to the N,

00:00:11.406 --> 00:00:16.242
which would be R to the K
plus R to the K plus one

00:00:16.242 --> 00:00:18.922
plus R to the K plus two and keep

00:00:18.922 --> 00:00:21.779
going on and on and on forever.

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:23.991
There are a few things we've
already thought about here.

00:00:23.991 --> 00:00:26.240
We know what the common ratio is.

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:31.240
So the common ratio,
which is the ratio between

00:00:31.558 --> 00:00:36.558
consecutive terms, is going
to be R to the K plus one.

00:00:36.956 --> 00:00:39.956
Actually, let me just write
this as R to the N plus one.

00:00:39.956 --> 00:00:42.473
I don't want to fixate on
this K right over here.

00:00:42.473 --> 00:00:46.273
So R to the N plus one over R to the N.

00:00:46.742 --> 00:00:48.985
Well, this is just going to be equal to R.

00:00:48.985 --> 00:00:51.374
Anything to the N plus one over
that same thing with the N,

00:00:51.374 --> 00:00:54.794
that's just going to be equal
to R, or R to the first power,

00:00:54.794 --> 00:00:56.004
and you see that here.

00:00:56.004 --> 00:00:57.573
When you go from one term to another

00:00:57.573 --> 00:01:00.974
you are just multiplying, you
are just multiplying by R,

00:01:01.491 --> 00:01:04.375
and this is all review.

00:01:04.375 --> 00:01:05.743
If it is not review, I encourage you

00:01:05.743 --> 00:01:08.440
to watch the videos on geometric series.

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:10.656
And what's interesting
about this is we've proven

00:01:10.656 --> 00:01:13.125
to ourselves, in the videos
about geometric series,

00:01:16.617 --> 00:01:19.339
that if the common ratio,
if the absolute value

00:01:19.339 --> 00:01:22.408
of the common ratio is less than one,

00:01:24.608 --> 00:01:28.291
then the series converges.

00:01:29.625 --> 00:01:32.257
And if the absolute value of R

00:01:32.257 --> 00:01:34.575
is greater than or equal to one,

00:01:34.575 --> 00:01:35.988
then the series diverges.

00:01:35.988 --> 00:01:37.693
And that makes sense,
we've proven it as well,

00:01:37.693 --> 00:01:39.457
but it also makes
logical sense that, look,

00:01:39.457 --> 00:01:41.892
if that absolute value
of R is less than one

00:01:41.892 --> 00:01:45.493
then each term here is going
to go down by that common,

00:01:45.493 --> 00:01:47.659
or it's going to be multiplied
by that common ratio,

00:01:47.659 --> 00:01:50.659
and it's going to decrease
on and on and on and on

00:01:50.659 --> 00:01:52.630
until it makes sense
that, even though this

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:56.459
is an infinite sum, it will
converge to a finite value.

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:59.459
Now, with that out of the way for review,

00:01:59.459 --> 00:02:04.459
let's tackle something a
little bit more interesting.

00:02:05.077 --> 00:02:07.493
Let's say that we want to look at a,

00:02:07.493 --> 00:02:11.526
we want to figure out
whether a series like this,

00:02:11.671 --> 00:02:13.793
so starting at N equals five to infinity

00:02:13.793 --> 00:02:17.180
of, let's say, N to the tenth power.

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:19.577
The numerator is growing quickly.

00:02:19.577 --> 00:02:23.492
N to the tenth power over N factorial,

00:02:23.492 --> 00:02:25.876
and factorial we know also
grows very, very quickly,

00:02:25.876 --> 00:02:27.127
probably it grows much faster than

00:02:27.127 --> 00:02:31.460
even a high degree polynomial like this,

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:33.243
or a high degree term like this,

00:02:33.243 --> 00:02:36.527
but how do we prove that it converges?

00:02:36.527 --> 00:02:38.293
We could definitely the diverges test

00:02:38.293 --> 00:02:41.065
to show that this does not diverge,

00:02:41.065 --> 00:02:44.078
but how do we prove that
this actually converges?

00:02:44.078 --> 00:02:47.543
And maybe we can use a little
bit of our intuition here.

00:02:47.959 --> 00:02:50.627
Well, let's see if we can
come up with a common ratio.

00:02:50.627 --> 00:02:53.144
So let's see if there's
a common ratio here.

00:02:53.144 --> 00:02:55.460
So let's take the N plus oneth term,

00:02:55.460 --> 00:02:59.841
which is going to be N
plus one to the tenth power

00:02:59.841 --> 00:03:04.841
over N plus one factorial and
divide that by the Nth term,

00:03:06.392 --> 00:03:11.392
so let's divide that by N to
the tenth over N factorial.

00:03:12.826 --> 00:03:15.243
Well, dividing by a fraction,
or dividing by anything,

00:03:15.243 --> 00:03:17.243
is equivalent to multiplying
by it's reciprocal,

00:03:17.243 --> 00:03:19.309
So let's just multiply by the reciprocal,

00:03:19.309 --> 00:03:24.001
so times N factorial over N to the tenth.

00:03:24.001 --> 00:03:26.592
Remember all I'm trying to do
is exactly right over here.

00:03:26.592 --> 00:03:30.043
See if there is some
type of a common ratio.

00:03:30.812 --> 00:03:32.259
Well, if we do a little algebra here

00:03:32.259 --> 00:03:36.341
N plus one factorial, and
factorial algebra is always fun.

00:03:36.341 --> 00:03:41.341
This is the same thing as N
plus one times N factorial.

00:03:43.043 --> 00:03:45.513
Times N factorial.

00:03:45.513 --> 00:03:46.698
You're not use to seeing order

00:03:46.698 --> 00:03:48.260
of operations with factorials,

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:51.359
but this factorial only applies
to this N right over here,

00:03:51.359 --> 00:03:52.877
and why is that useful?

00:03:52.877 --> 00:03:55.626
Because this N factorial
cancels with this N factorial,

00:03:55.626 --> 00:04:00.626
and we're left with N plus
one to the tenth power

00:04:00.758 --> 00:04:05.758
over N plus one times N to the tenth.

00:04:08.376 --> 00:04:10.505
Times N to the tenth.

00:04:10.505 --> 00:04:11.691
So I know what you're thinking.

00:04:11.691 --> 00:04:14.145
"Hey, wait, look, this isn't
a fixed common ratio here."

00:04:14.145 --> 00:04:16.545
The ratio between consecutive terms here,

00:04:16.545 --> 00:04:19.361
when I took the N plus oneth
term divided by the Nth term,

00:04:19.361 --> 00:04:22.009
it's changing depending on what my N is.

00:04:22.009 --> 00:04:25.996
This ratio, I guess you
could say, is a function of N

00:04:25.996 --> 00:04:27.896
so this doesn't seem too useful,

00:04:27.896 --> 00:04:29.079
but what if I were to say,

00:04:29.079 --> 00:04:31.046
"O.K., well look, with any of these series

00:04:31.046 --> 00:04:33.546
"we really care about
the behavior as our N's

00:04:33.546 --> 00:04:35.777
"get really, really, really large as

00:04:35.777 --> 00:04:38.947
the limit, as our N's, go to infinity."

00:04:38.947 --> 00:04:40.878
So what if we were to
look at the behavior here,

00:04:40.878 --> 00:04:42.129
and if this is approaching some

00:04:42.129 --> 00:04:43.928
actual values as N approaches infinity,

00:04:43.928 --> 00:04:45.679
well, it would make conceptual sense

00:04:45.679 --> 00:04:47.212
that we could kind of think of that as

00:04:50.596 --> 00:04:52.129
the limit of our common ratio.

00:04:52.796 --> 00:04:54.177
So let's do that.

00:04:54.177 --> 00:04:59.177
Let's take the limit as N
approaches infinity of this thing.

00:05:00.329 --> 00:05:01.547
So remember what we're doing here.

00:05:01.547 --> 00:05:03.379
This isn't just kind of some voodoo.

00:05:03.379 --> 00:05:06.713
Conceptually, let me copy and paste this.

00:05:07.662 --> 00:05:09.262
Conceptually, we're just trying to think

00:05:09.262 --> 00:05:12.278
about what is the common ratio approach?

00:05:12.278 --> 00:05:14.212
What is the ratio between
consecutive terms?

00:05:14.212 --> 00:05:15.963
The N plus one term and the Nth term

00:05:15.963 --> 00:05:18.947
as N gets really, really,
really, really large?

00:05:19.347 --> 00:05:22.178
And what we see here is
we have this up here,

00:05:22.178 --> 00:05:23.213
we don't even have to multiply it out,

00:05:23.213 --> 00:05:24.743
this is going to be N to the tenth

00:05:24.743 --> 00:05:26.329
plus a bunch of other stuff.

00:05:26.329 --> 00:05:28.612
It's going to be a
tenth degree polynomial,

00:05:28.612 --> 00:05:31.070
and this down here is going to be,

00:05:31.070 --> 00:05:32.629
actually you can figure it out,

00:05:32.629 --> 00:05:36.064
this is going to be N to the
11th plus N to the tenth power,

00:05:36.972 --> 00:05:38.573
so the limit as N approaches infinity,

00:05:38.573 --> 00:05:40.287
well this denominator is going
to grow faster than that.

00:05:40.287 --> 00:05:41.504
You could divide the numerator

00:05:41.504 --> 00:05:43.156
and the denominator by N to the tenth,

00:05:46.662 --> 00:05:48.705
actually the numerator and the
denominator by N to the 11th,

00:05:48.705 --> 00:05:50.740
and everything up here
is going to go to zero,

00:05:50.740 --> 00:05:52.622
and this is going to be one,

00:05:52.622 --> 00:05:54.504
and so the limit, right over here,

00:05:57.148 --> 00:06:00.479
this limit is going to be equal to...

00:06:01.355 --> 00:06:04.522
This limit is going to be equal to zero.

00:06:04.522 --> 00:06:06.155
As N approaches infinity one way the ratio

00:06:06.155 --> 00:06:11.155
between consecutive terms approaches zero.

00:06:12.819 --> 00:06:17.772
So this seems, if we use
the logic from our common

00:06:17.772 --> 00:06:19.823
ratio up here when we
looked at geometric series,

00:06:19.823 --> 00:06:21.538
this is clearly not a geometric series,

00:06:21.538 --> 00:06:23.487
but we would say, "Well, look, as N gets

00:06:23.487 --> 00:06:25.439
really, really, really
large the ratio between

00:06:25.439 --> 00:06:27.638
"consecutive terms gets smaller
and smaller and smaller.

00:06:27.638 --> 00:06:30.689
"Hey, maybe we could
make the same conclusion.

00:06:31.105 --> 00:06:32.438
"Maybe we could make
the same conclusion that

00:06:32.438 --> 00:06:37.438
"therefore this series
actually converges."

00:06:38.073 --> 00:06:43.073
The series actually converges,
so N factorial converges.

00:06:43.465 --> 00:06:45.600
So can we make this statement?

00:06:45.600 --> 00:06:48.607
And the answer is yes we can,

00:06:48.607 --> 00:06:52.500
and what allows us to
do it is the ratio test.

00:06:52.531 --> 00:06:54.260
Is the ratio test.

00:06:54.260 --> 00:06:55.325
Let me write that down.

00:06:55.325 --> 00:06:57.501
The ratio test.

00:06:58.040 --> 00:07:00.873
And all the ratio test tells us is

00:07:00.873 --> 00:07:03.739
if we have an infinite series...

00:07:03.739 --> 00:07:04.969
If we have an infinite series,

00:07:04.969 --> 00:07:09.076
and I can say from N equals K to infinity,

00:07:09.076 --> 00:07:14.076
and if we take the limit
as N approaches infinity,

00:07:17.883 --> 00:07:22.324
of the absolute value
of A to the N plus one

00:07:22.324 --> 00:07:25.140
over A to the N, and over here I didn't

00:07:25.140 --> 00:07:26.660
take the absolute value of that limit,

00:07:26.660 --> 00:07:28.042
but we absolutely could have taken

00:07:28.042 --> 00:07:29.825
the absolute value of that limit

00:07:29.825 --> 00:07:33.075
if all of these terms right
over here were positive,

00:07:33.075 --> 00:07:35.026
so the absolute value would
be the same thing as itself.

00:07:36.118 --> 00:07:38.383
If this approaches some limit,

00:07:38.921 --> 00:07:40.443
if this approaches some limit,

00:07:40.443 --> 00:07:44.040
so once again, this limit is
what is going to be our ratio

00:07:44.040 --> 00:07:47.698
between consecutive terms
as N gets larger and larger,

00:07:48.467 --> 00:07:53.467
the ratio tells us if L is less than one,

00:07:55.342 --> 00:07:58.358
which was the situation here,
L is clearly less than one,

00:07:58.358 --> 00:08:00.509
then the series converges.

00:08:04.653 --> 00:08:07.908
Some definitions will say
it's absolutely convergent,

00:08:07.908 --> 00:08:09.826
it converges absolutely,
the absolute value

00:08:09.826 --> 00:08:12.258
of the series converges,
but then that also means

00:08:12.258 --> 00:08:14.246
that the series itself converges.

00:08:14.246 --> 00:08:19.246
If L is greater than one
then series diverges,

00:08:20.735 --> 00:08:22.903
Series diverges.

00:08:23.595 --> 00:08:28.192
and if L is equal to one it's
inconclusive, we don't know.

00:08:29.191 --> 00:08:31.091
We would have to do some other test

00:08:31.091 --> 00:08:34.659
to prove whether it converges or diverges.

00:08:35.193 --> 00:08:37.291
So that's the essence of the ratio test.

00:08:37.291 --> 00:08:39.758
Find the absolute value of the ratio

00:08:39.758 --> 00:08:41.408
between consecutive terms,

00:08:41.408 --> 00:08:43.127
take the limit as N approaches infinity,

00:08:43.127 --> 00:08:46.742
if that approaches an actual limit,

00:08:46.742 --> 00:08:51.742
and that limit is less than
one, then the series converges,

00:08:51.923 --> 00:08:53.798
and it's really based on
the same fundamental idea

00:08:53.798 --> 00:08:57.381
that we saw with the common
ratio of geometric series.
