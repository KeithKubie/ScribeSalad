that is hugely expensive it's not
convenient at all especially when you've

00:14:19.300 --> 00:14:19.310
convenient at all especially when you've
 

00:14:19.310 --> 00:14:21.910

things you need Karachi you need
 

00:14:46.220 --> 00:14:49.059
things you need Karachi you need
Pakistan for that but it's going to be

00:14:49.059 --> 00:14:49.069
Pakistan for that but it's going to be
 

00:14:49.069 --> 00:14:52.960
Pakistan for that but it's going to be
very difficult and and you need

00:14:52.960 --> 00:14:52.970
very difficult and and you need
 

00:14:52.970 --> 00:14:55.240
very difficult and and you need
relationships with Iran particular I'd

00:14:55.240 --> 00:14:55.250

talks process which I'll get into a bit
later and and and then of course there's

00:15:06.040 --> 00:15:06.050
later and and and then of course there's
 

00:15:06.050 --> 00:15:07.900
later and and and then of course there's
a long-term stability that you want for

00:15:07.900 --> 00:15:07.910
a long-term stability that you want for

00:17:36.270 --> 00:17:38.670
 
the second issue that I find very

00:17:38.670 --> 00:17:38.680
the second issue that I find very
 

00:17:38.680 --> 00:17:40.940
the second issue that I find very
disturbing is that is the huge growth in

00:17:40.940 --> 00:17:40.950
disturbing is that is the huge growth in
 

00:17:40.950 --> 00:17:45.980

ethnic unrest in Afghanistan in 10 years

00:17:45.980 --> 00:17:45.990

00:17:48.700 --> 00:17:51.450
partly this has been fueled by the talks
with the Taliban because the as you know

00:17:51.450 --> 00:17:51.460
with the Taliban because the as you know
 

00:17:51.460 --> 00:17:53.670

these talks with the Taliban is a very
 

00:17:57.790 --> 00:18:01.320
these talks with the Taliban is a very
grave threat to them they don't want the

Taliban back in any shape or form and

00:18:03.240 --> 00:18:03.250
Taliban back in any shape or form and
 

00:18:03.250 --> 00:18:04.830
Taliban back in any shape or form and
what has being talked about is it

00:18:04.830 --> 00:18:04.840
what has being talked about is it
 

00:18:04.840 --> 00:18:07.860
what has being talked about is it
possible you know power-sharing deal etc

00:18:07.860 --> 00:18:07.870

single Pashtun who's fighting for the
 

00:27:41.379 --> 00:27:44.099
single Pashtun who's fighting for the
Taliban because if there are 15 million

00:27:44.099 --> 00:27:44.109
Taliban because if there are 15 million
 

00:27:44.109 --> 00:27:46.109
Taliban because if there are 15 million
mushrooms in Afghanistan they're 40

00:27:46.109 --> 00:27:46.119
mushrooms in Afghanistan they're 40
 

00:27:46.119 --> 00:27:48.659
mushrooms in Afghanistan they're 40
million in Pakistan and there's no

00:27:48.659 --> 00:27:48.669
million in Pakistan and there's no
 

00:27:48.669 --> 00:27:50.969
million in Pakistan and there's no
shortage of them you know pashtuns

00:27:50.969 --> 00:27:50.979
shortage of them you know pashtuns
 

00:27:50.979 --> 00:27:53.969
shortage of them you know pashtuns
coming into you know and and they're

00:27:53.969 --> 00:27:53.979
coming into you know and and they're
 

00:27:53.979 --> 00:27:55.829
coming into you know and and they're
only have you know hundred thousand

00:27:55.829 --> 00:27:55.839

troops there of the of American troops
so this is a bit disproportionate you

00:28:00.629 --> 00:28:00.639
so this is a bit disproportionate you
 

00:28:00.639 --> 00:28:05.219
so this is a bit disproportionate you
know so my this idea that somehow you

00:28:05.219 --> 00:28:05.229
know so my this idea that somehow you
 

00:28:05.229 --> 00:28:08.430
know so my this idea that somehow you
you fight to the last minute of 2014 and

00:28:08.430 --> 00:28:08.440
you fight to the last minute of 2014 and
 

00:28:08.440 --> 00:28:10.169
you fight to the last minute of 2014 and
then you would draw

00:28:10.169 --> 00:28:10.179
then you would draw
 

00:28:10.179 --> 00:28:11.879
then you would draw
then you leave the Afghan troops to

00:28:11.879 --> 00:28:11.889
then you leave the Afghan troops to
 

00:28:11.889 --> 00:28:14.369
then you leave the Afghan troops to
carry on the fight and they will stand

00:28:14.369 --> 00:28:14.379
carry on the fight and they will stand
 

00:28:14.379 --> 00:28:17.609
carry on the fight and they will stand
there staunchly and carry on the fight i

00:28:17.609 --> 00:28:17.619

are and if there's no sign of a
political solution then the Taliban will

on the myths and then and then what we
 

00:40:07.210 --> 00:40:09.569
on the myths and then and then what we
should do one thing that sort of

obviously humanitarian one and an
ethical one in terms of you know we have

ethical one in terms of you know we have
 

00:40:29.290 --> 00:40:32.040
ethical one in terms of you know we have
had thousands tens of thousands of

we should you know negotiate with those
 

00:41:35.620 --> 00:41:38.100
we should you know negotiate with those
elements but this is a very serious

mean these are all very big

01:15:39.730 --> 01:15:39.740
mean these are all very big
 

01:15:39.740 --> 01:15:43.250
mean these are all very big
imponderables you know the assumption is

01:15:43.250 --> 01:15:43.260
imponderables you know the assumption is
 

01:15:43.260 --> 01:15:44.960
imponderables you know the assumption is
that if there is a big know if there's a

01:15:44.960 --> 01:15:44.970
that if there is a big know if there's a
 

01:15:44.970 --> 01:15:47.690

01:15:49.100 --> 01:15:49.110
ceasefire and then there's sort of
 

01:15:49.110 --> 01:15:51.560
ceasefire and then there's sort of
negotiations for power sharing you would

01:15:51.560 --> 01:15:51.570
negotiations for power sharing you would
 

01:15:51.570 --> 01:15:53.330
negotiations for power sharing you would
need some kind of Loya Jirga or

01:15:53.330 --> 01:15:53.340
need some kind of Loya Jirga or
 

01:15:53.340 --> 01:16:00.470
need some kind of Loya Jirga or
something to validate a a new new piece

01:16:00.470 --> 01:16:00.480
