00:00:38.770 --> 00:00:41.750
We are here in the
Jefferson Studios

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:43.260
at the Library of Congress.

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:45.580

&gt;&gt; Guha Shankar: So,
thank you very much,

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:54.730
Dr. Patterson, for
being with us.

00:00:54.730 --> 00:00:56.800
It's a real honor and a
privilege to have you here,

00:00:56.800 --> 00:00:58.830
and great seeing you again.

00:00:58.830 --> 00:01:00.130
&gt;&gt; Dr. Lotsee Paterson:
Thank you.

00:01:00.130 --> 00:01:01.430
&gt;&gt; Guha Shankar: Okay.

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:04.810
Well, we're going to go into
some details of your career

00:01:04.810 --> 00:01:09.270
and your involvement with
libraries and providing services

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:12.440
for Native American people
here in the United States

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:15.540
and your reach, which
is vast and wide.

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:20.000
Just for the record, I would
note that you are a graduate

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.320
of the Oklahoma College
for Women in 1959.

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:24.580
You have earned your Master's
Degree in Library Science

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:27.060
and Doctorate Degree in
Educational Technology

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:29.200
from the University of Oklahoma.

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:30.950
You are a professor
emeritus of the Library

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:32.820
and Information Studies at OU

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:35.660
and you taught there
for 17 years.

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:37.510
Awards are too numerous
to mention

00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:41.120
so we'll merely append a PDF
of all of the lengthy list

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:43.500
of your accomplishments in
the interview transcript

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:44.900
at some point, when
we get that up.

00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:46.200
&gt;&gt; Dr. Lotsee Paterson:
Thank you.

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:47.500
&gt;&gt; Guha Shankar: But a long

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:48.800
and distinguished
career, to be sure.

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:53.050
And again, it's a real honor and
a privilege to have you here.

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:56.250
Maybe we might begin by asking
you some biographical details

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:58.730
as to where you were
born, some details

00:01:58.730 --> 00:02:03.230
about your childhood growing
up in Apache, Oklahoma.

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:05.490
Then, we can move into
other areas and talk

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:07.500
about your career, if
that's okay with you.

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:08.800
&gt;&gt; Dr. Lotsee Paterson:
Well, where I was born

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:13.240
and raised really accounts
for my career and why I went

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:16.790
into Library Services
focusing on American Indians.

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:22.350
I was born 1931 -- I'm very old
-- December the third, 1931.

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:26.920
So, I grew up in an
allotment in Oklahoma --

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:31.360
we don't have reservations, so
we had little squares of land --

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:35.750
way out in the country, in
1931, height of the Depression,

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:38.990
then the Dust Bowl,
then World War II.

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:44.540
And so, all those things were
dramatic, emotional, hard times.

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:48.480
But my mother was
a college graduate

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:51.730
so I always had things
to read at my home.

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:53.960
Books. She ordered books
from the state library.

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:55.260
I think that's so remarkable.

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:57.650
In 1930s, they'd come by mail.

00:02:57.650 --> 00:02:58.950
So, I always had books.

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:00.520
The schools did not have books.

00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:03.830
Most of my neighbors
didn't have books.

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:08.980
So, I guess I grew
up loving to read.

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:11.690
When I started teaching
some years later

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:13.760
in a little rural school
with Indian students,

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:18.250
90% of them were Indian, I
realized they had nothing

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:19.550
in their homes to read.

00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:21.300
Nothing. No newspapers,
magazines.

00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:24.190
Nothing. And I thought
of, I'd describe it

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:28.740
as being a little flame that
started and that kept burning

00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:32.280
and smoldering, and I
kept trying at that point,

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:34.780
even wanting to do
something about it.

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:40.560
Skip years later, my life
has been a kind of series

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:43.900
of not being planned but
things just happened.

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:48.350
And after, I had five
kids and I got a divorce.

00:03:48.350 --> 00:03:52.190
And I had needed a better job
than that little rural school.

00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:54.940
So, I went to a nearby Bureau
of Indian Affairs School,

00:03:54.940 --> 00:03:58.170
it was a high school, where
we had a nice library.

00:03:58.170 --> 00:04:01.600
But the kids there had grown up
in the heart of the Reservation,

00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:06.780
on Navajo and Dakotas, and they
too, you know, had no libraries.

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:08.680
But I worked in the
library while I was there

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:10.080
for an hour or two a day.

00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:15.070
And the government, because BI
schools are 12 months a year,

00:04:15.070 --> 00:04:17.220
they have to something with
the teachers in the summer,

00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:20.000
so they sent me to
library school.

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:22.230
Little did they know I
would never come back.

00:04:22.230 --> 00:04:24.480
But then I got a fellowship

00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:28.520
and I cannot give credit enough
credit to federal programs

00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:31.690
that offer scholarships,
fellowships for students.

00:04:31.690 --> 00:04:34.200
I would've never been
able to get a degree.

00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:38.230
So, I got a fellowship,
got my Master's Degree,

00:04:38.230 --> 00:04:43.000
and since you could take
all the courses you wanted

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:46.040
for the same tuition
because grant was paying,

00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:48.650
scholarship was paying
for it, I took 45 hours

00:04:48.650 --> 00:04:49.950
on a Master's program.

00:04:49.950 --> 00:04:52.320
I crammed it all in.

00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:56.310
And I intended to go back to
the BI school but I realized,

00:04:56.310 --> 00:05:00.570
with five little kids to take
care of, it was really hard

00:05:00.570 --> 00:05:04.240
to work the hours and so forth.

00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:07.880
So, skipping forward, I
went to down college of ed,

00:05:07.880 --> 00:05:15.050
got an assistantship, I
guess, and got my Ph.D.

00:05:15.050 --> 00:05:21.430
In library school,
the Department

00:05:21.430 --> 00:05:24.990
of Interior librarian had come
and given a guest lecture.

00:05:24.990 --> 00:05:27.130
I mean, all these
things are accidents.

00:05:27.130 --> 00:05:28.650
You can't plan them.

00:05:28.650 --> 00:05:29.950
&gt;&gt; Guha Shankar:
So, this was all

00:05:29.950 --> 00:05:31.250
at the University of Oklahoma?

00:05:31.250 --> 00:05:32.550
&gt;&gt; Dr. Lotsee Paterson:
University of Oklahoma.

00:05:32.550 --> 00:05:35.470
Right. So, I really kind
of just think things happen

00:05:35.470 --> 00:05:37.120
to me and, oh, you know?

00:05:37.120 --> 00:05:38.770
But then I followed.

00:05:38.770 --> 00:05:42.240
But he came to give a lecture
and I talked to him afterwards

00:05:42.240 --> 00:05:46.220
about my concern about school
libraries in BI schools.

00:05:46.220 --> 00:05:48.750
That one little short
conversation --

00:05:48.750 --> 00:05:52.840
after finishing my Ph.D., I
got a call from the University

00:05:52.840 --> 00:05:55.660
of Mexico offering me
a faculty position.

00:05:55.660 --> 00:06:00.200
And that Department of Interior
librarian had talked to them.

00:06:00.200 --> 00:06:02.730
They had said, "Do you know
anybody who's American Indian?"

00:06:02.730 --> 00:06:06.000
It's the days when they
really wanted minority people.

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:09.660
Anyway, that led to my job
at the University of Mexico.

00:06:09.660 --> 00:06:14.230
When I got out there, I decided
that I would try to do something

00:06:14.230 --> 00:06:16.130
with the Indian schools
out there.

00:06:16.130 --> 00:06:20.760
So, I learned all of the
grants that the government has

00:06:20.760 --> 00:06:24.890
and I began to look for grants
and found, the title to be,

00:06:24.890 --> 00:06:28.380
Higher Education Act:
Research and Demonstration.

00:06:28.380 --> 00:06:31.200
So I wrote a grant to
work with the schools.

00:06:31.200 --> 00:06:35.060
I had a hidden agenda;
I often do.

00:06:35.060 --> 00:06:37.700
The grant was for
training, and --

00:06:37.700 --> 00:06:40.410
or, I mean, research
and demonstration.

00:06:40.410 --> 00:06:43.930
But I secretly wanted to start
schools in the libraries,

00:06:43.930 --> 00:06:46.150
libraries in the schools.

00:06:46.150 --> 00:06:51.060
And so I did, and got the grant,
started with some schools.

00:06:51.060 --> 00:06:54.450
While I had just started
and I began to get,

00:06:54.450 --> 00:06:58.460
we call it the Moccasin Grape
Fund, where word spreads.

00:06:58.460 --> 00:07:02.500
There are 19 pueblos
in New Mexico

00:07:02.500 --> 00:07:05.270
and two Apache tribes
in the Navajo.

00:07:05.270 --> 00:07:09.090
So, they heard about me and what
I was doing and began to reach

00:07:09.090 --> 00:07:13.120
out to me, the tribal
people did.

00:07:13.120 --> 00:07:17.050
"Would you help us get a
library in the pueblo?"

00:07:17.050 --> 00:07:18.350
"Well, of course!"

00:07:18.350 --> 00:07:21.820
One of my, sort of,
philosophies is never say no

00:07:21.820 --> 00:07:24.110
to something that's
a good cause.

00:07:24.110 --> 00:07:26.120
&gt;&gt; Guha Shankar: What years
are you talking about?

00:07:26.120 --> 00:07:28.460
&gt;&gt; Dr. Lotsee Paterson: I
started out there in 1972.

00:07:28.460 --> 00:07:31.560
So, my first grant was 1973.

00:07:31.560 --> 00:07:37.070
So, for the following four or
five years I had federal grants

00:07:37.070 --> 00:07:39.590
to work with the
pueblos and helping them

00:07:39.590 --> 00:07:40.980
with library services.

00:07:40.980 --> 00:07:43.990
I started libraries from
nothing: you know, in hallways,

00:07:43.990 --> 00:07:46.130
in food co-ops, in offices.

00:07:46.130 --> 00:07:47.430
Because another one

00:07:47.430 --> 00:07:51.030
of my philosophies is you
can start a library anywhere.

00:07:51.030 --> 00:07:52.650
And I get so irked
when people say,

00:07:52.650 --> 00:07:54.240
"Well, we don't have money."

00:07:54.240 --> 00:07:56.360
I don't care if you
don't have money.

00:07:56.360 --> 00:07:58.080
Do it anyway!

00:07:58.080 --> 00:08:00.330
And that's kind of
the way I started.

00:08:00.330 --> 00:08:03.020
And they began to
build and grow.

00:08:03.020 --> 00:08:08.220
And the pueblo people
really wanted them because,

00:08:08.220 --> 00:08:11.690
as they have said to
me, "We now realize --

00:08:11.690 --> 00:08:15.920
" and they are much more
culturally pure than Oklahoma

00:08:15.920 --> 00:08:19.250
in terms of not integrating
because they're

00:08:19.250 --> 00:08:20.910
in these remote reservations

00:08:20.910 --> 00:08:23.840
where they are among
their own people 24/7.

00:08:23.840 --> 00:08:25.820
Not true in Oklahoma.

00:08:25.820 --> 00:08:32.790
So I discovered, in talking to
them, one of them said to me,

00:08:32.790 --> 00:08:36.410
"We can no longer live the
way we have been doing.

00:08:36.410 --> 00:08:39.860
We must get our children
educated."

00:08:39.860 --> 00:08:43.520
And they saw the library as
a way to get them educated.

00:08:43.520 --> 00:08:45.760
And they said to
me, "You cannot --

00:08:45.760 --> 00:08:49.280
our children are bused
50 miles away to school.

00:08:49.280 --> 00:08:50.820
They get on the bus and go home.

00:08:50.820 --> 00:08:53.950
They have no libraries to go to.

00:08:53.950 --> 00:08:55.840
So, we want a library.

00:08:55.840 --> 00:08:57.930
They can go after
school, they can study,

00:08:57.930 --> 00:09:00.000
they can do their homework."

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:02.500
Anyway, that's sort of
a little synopsis of,

00:09:02.500 --> 00:09:04.570
kind of, the nutshell.

00:09:04.570 --> 00:09:06.970
But they wanted them,
that was the thing.

00:09:06.970 --> 00:09:10.920
And I always went to them,
said, "Do you want a library?"

00:09:10.920 --> 00:09:13.950
and let them tell
me what they wanted.

00:09:13.950 --> 00:09:16.550
And I got the most
interesting --

00:09:16.550 --> 00:09:18.950
you know, because I hired
people to help teach

00:09:18.950 --> 00:09:23.100
and they had the typical
librarian mindset of "Okay,

00:09:23.100 --> 00:09:24.800
we'll buy this reference
book and that."

00:09:24.800 --> 00:09:26.100
No, no, no.

00:09:26.100 --> 00:09:28.170
You ask them what they want.

00:09:28.170 --> 00:09:32.750
I got answers like, "We want the
state statutes and state codes

00:09:32.750 --> 00:09:34.230
because we don't want to have

00:09:34.230 --> 00:09:36.980
to go ask people,
'What does it say?'

00:09:36.980 --> 00:09:39.700
We want to know for ourselves.

00:09:39.700 --> 00:09:44.220
We want things for our
children to do their homework."

00:09:44.220 --> 00:09:45.520
I forget. And, of course,

00:09:45.520 --> 00:09:48.290
anything about their
tribe or their pueblo.

00:09:48.290 --> 00:09:51.380
First, their pueblo, and
then Indians in general,

00:09:51.380 --> 00:09:52.880
they wanted in their library.

00:09:52.880 --> 00:09:57.920
But they did have constraints
about some materials,

00:09:57.920 --> 00:10:01.560
some well-known authors who were
not Indian who had written books

00:10:01.560 --> 00:10:06.400
about them: they didn't want
those books in those libraries

00:10:06.400 --> 00:10:07.700
for obvious reasons.

00:10:07.700 --> 00:10:11.690
They were not truthful, they
were misleading, and many times,

00:10:11.690 --> 00:10:15.870
derogatory, or if they had put
things in there that had to do

00:10:15.870 --> 00:10:18.440
with their religion,
or certain things

00:10:18.440 --> 00:10:23.380
that shouldn't be told a
certain time of the year.

00:10:23.380 --> 00:10:25.830
And it was kind of
interesting, really,

00:10:25.830 --> 00:10:28.650
because it was a federal grant,

00:10:28.650 --> 00:10:33.580
and the federal attitude
is, "We cannot restrict."

00:10:33.580 --> 00:10:36.220
So, I actually got an
opinion from the Department

00:10:36.220 --> 00:10:38.800
of Ed's solicitor:
"Yes, you can."

00:10:38.800 --> 00:10:43.760
And so that turned out to be
kind of an interesting thing.

00:10:43.760 --> 00:10:45.950
But the libraries took
hold, and they grew,

00:10:45.950 --> 00:10:47.940
and I had a certain philosophy

00:10:47.940 --> 00:10:51.170
that I would provide the
training -- not salaries.

00:10:51.170 --> 00:10:54.530
I would not hire anybody
because I knew, if I hired them,

00:10:54.530 --> 00:10:56.260
when the grant was
gone, they were gone.

00:10:56.260 --> 00:10:58.110
&gt;&gt; Guha Shankar: So, let
me ask you a little bit

00:10:58.110 --> 00:11:00.060
about the training part of it.

00:11:00.060 --> 00:11:01.360
&gt;&gt; Dr. Lotsee Patterson: Yeah.

00:11:01.360 --> 00:11:02.660
&gt;&gt; Guha Shankar: So,
obviously facilities

00:11:02.660 --> 00:11:04.560
and building the library is
one thing, but I'm just --

00:11:04.560 --> 00:11:07.830
I really would like to know
-- when you started out,

00:11:07.830 --> 00:11:09.990
what was the level of, you
know, professional training

00:11:09.990 --> 00:11:12.320
or development available
for Native people

00:11:12.320 --> 00:11:13.620
who wanted [inaudible] --

00:11:13.620 --> 00:11:15.350
&gt;&gt; Dr. Lotsee Patterson: Well,
these were reservations way

00:11:15.350 --> 00:11:17.250
out from the middle of nowhere.

00:11:17.250 --> 00:11:21.980
And I also knew that you
better do it their way

00:11:21.980 --> 00:11:23.290
or you're not going
to be successful.

00:11:23.290 --> 00:11:26.760
We had professors thrown off of
reservations because they came

00:11:26.760 --> 00:11:29.140
in wanting to tell
them what to do.

00:11:29.140 --> 00:11:33.150
So, we took -- I said to
the tribal leadership,

00:11:33.150 --> 00:11:36.990
"You choose the person
you want me to train,

00:11:36.990 --> 00:11:39.480
and I will train them."

00:11:39.480 --> 00:11:43.720
And then I relied on that person
to ask the tribe for some money

00:11:43.720 --> 00:11:45.350
to get, like, reference books

00:11:45.350 --> 00:11:48.510
and you know, build
the collection.

00:11:48.510 --> 00:11:52.480
I had some money I could
build basic, you know,

00:11:52.480 --> 00:11:54.790
I could buy some basic tools.

00:11:54.790 --> 00:12:00.390
But anyway, it's really -- it
just came together and it grew,

00:12:00.390 --> 00:12:04.760
but part of the success of
that was letting them choose

00:12:04.760 --> 00:12:09.740
who they wanted me to train,
many times an older person.

00:12:09.740 --> 00:12:14.060
And I've learned that that's
good because younger ones want

00:12:14.060 --> 00:12:15.360
to work just so long enough

00:12:15.360 --> 00:12:17.590
to find another job
where it's better.

00:12:17.590 --> 00:12:21.400
The older ones were
vested in the community,

00:12:21.400 --> 00:12:26.230
they knew the culture,
they knew the morays.

00:12:26.230 --> 00:12:32.640
And so, I, you know, that
was an element of success.

00:12:32.640 --> 00:12:37.730
But that, because it was so
successful in New Mexico,

00:12:37.730 --> 00:12:43.110
many other places copied,
I guess is the right word,

00:12:43.110 --> 00:12:47.360
my proposals and got them
funded in the Dakotas,

00:12:47.360 --> 00:12:51.950
so it really carried much
further than New Mexico.

00:12:51.950 --> 00:12:54.510
And of course, the
federal agency really liked

00:12:54.510 --> 00:12:57.800
that because, so their
money was doing good things.

00:12:57.800 --> 00:13:01.870
But the tribes came -- they
would keep hiring this person,

00:13:01.870 --> 00:13:04.290
even after I was
through training.

00:13:04.290 --> 00:13:07.820
They had enough basic training
they could operate the library.

00:13:07.820 --> 00:13:10.370
And I tried to work
with the state library,

00:13:10.370 --> 00:13:11.670
and that's very difficult.

00:13:11.670 --> 00:13:14.370
Some states will have
nothing to do with the tribes

00:13:14.370 --> 00:13:17.090
because they're federal
responsibility,

00:13:17.090 --> 00:13:21.550
and the states say, "We have
no obligation to the tribes."

00:13:21.550 --> 00:13:24.130
It just varies among the
states, but I worked on those

00:13:24.130 --> 00:13:27.340
in New Mexico, and they
were, "Well, they can come

00:13:27.340 --> 00:13:31.420
to our training programs" and
so, just many little pieces have

00:13:31.420 --> 00:13:33.700
to fit together, but
you have to start

00:13:33.700 --> 00:13:39.210
with letting the Native people
tell you what they want.

00:13:39.210 --> 00:13:41.440
Many things have
not been successful

00:13:41.440 --> 00:13:46.610
because people didn't
know how to approach that.

00:13:46.610 --> 00:13:48.810
Well, it was so successful,

00:13:48.810 --> 00:13:50.760
and then there was the
White House conferences,

00:13:50.760 --> 00:13:52.780
which librarians know about.

00:13:52.780 --> 00:13:55.940
We got an Indian delegation;
Department of Interior funded,

00:13:55.940 --> 00:13:58.850
helped fund a Indian
pre-conference,

00:13:58.850 --> 00:14:02.460
so we got resolutions and
so forth, so we got that fed

00:14:02.460 --> 00:14:04.650
into the National Conference,

00:14:04.650 --> 00:14:07.540
and after the National
Conference --

00:14:07.540 --> 00:14:09.340
White House Conference --
in Rothburys [phonetic] --

00:14:09.340 --> 00:14:11.130
&gt;&gt; Guha Shankar: I'm sorry,
Dr. Lotsee, when would that --

00:14:11.130 --> 00:14:13.220
&gt;&gt; Dr. Lotsee Patterson:
Seventy-nine was the first one.

00:14:13.220 --> 00:14:14.520
&gt;&gt; Guha Shankar: Okay.

00:14:14.520 --> 00:14:15.820
&gt;&gt; Dr. Lotsee Patterson: 1979.

00:14:15.820 --> 00:14:18.160
But I want to credit the
National Commission on Libraries

00:14:18.160 --> 00:14:19.910
and Information Science.

00:14:19.910 --> 00:14:24.380
They no longer exist, but
for a number of years,

00:14:24.380 --> 00:14:26.920
they were a federally --

00:14:26.920 --> 00:14:29.940
a presidentially-appointed
commission,

00:14:29.940 --> 00:14:34.190
and their mission was
to tell the president

00:14:34.190 --> 00:14:40.410
and Congress what the needs
for libraries was nationwide.

00:14:40.410 --> 00:14:44.760
And that made a huge difference.

00:14:44.760 --> 00:14:46.910
The associate director
of the commission,

00:14:46.910 --> 00:14:51.250
Mary Alice Hedge-Reszetar, had
been a congressional staffer,

00:14:51.250 --> 00:14:55.090
so she knew how to do
the legislative thing,

00:14:55.090 --> 00:14:57.480
so after the White
House Conference,

00:14:57.480 --> 00:15:00.700
she went to Paul Simon, the
congressman of Illinois,

00:15:00.700 --> 00:15:02.430
and said, "Look,
here's some resolutions;

00:15:02.430 --> 00:15:04.780
we haven't done anything
about these."

00:15:04.780 --> 00:15:06.080
That was all it took.

00:15:06.080 --> 00:15:08.710
He called me in, I
worked with his staff,

00:15:08.710 --> 00:15:10.440
I drafted the legislation.

00:15:10.440 --> 00:15:12.900
You know, like I -- today.

00:15:12.900 --> 00:15:17.460
I said, "Here's what I
know the needs to be,

00:15:17.460 --> 00:15:19.440
and here's what the
resolutions say."

00:15:19.440 --> 00:15:22.970
So, we wrote -- I
drafted the legislation,

00:15:22.970 --> 00:15:26.250
they put their stuff, you
know, their lingo into it,

00:15:26.250 --> 00:15:30.070
and Simon successfully
got it through Congress.

00:15:30.070 --> 00:15:31.370
&gt;&gt; Guha Shankar: So, can
you tell us a little bit

00:15:31.370 --> 00:15:33.830
about what's in the legislation,
just as a sort of --

00:15:33.830 --> 00:15:35.130
&gt;&gt; Dr. Lotsee Patterson: Well,

00:15:35.130 --> 00:15:38.360
it basically gave
them some funds.

00:15:38.360 --> 00:15:41.370
Not a small amount, but
that's really all it took.

00:15:41.370 --> 00:15:44.020
They could match it with some
tribal funds, and then they --

00:15:44.020 --> 00:15:48.630
and the salaries that the
librarians were abominably low,

00:15:48.630 --> 00:15:54.510
but if you're 50 miles from
anywhere, any salary is welcome.

00:15:54.510 --> 00:15:59.630
So, that happened, and when that
was enacted and passed into law

00:15:59.630 --> 00:16:01.950
and -- Reagan signed it.

00:16:01.950 --> 00:16:04.340
Reagan signed the law --

00:16:04.340 --> 00:16:07.650
the U.S. Department of
Ed said, "Wait a minute.

00:16:07.650 --> 00:16:09.780
We don't know anything
about Indians."

00:16:09.780 --> 00:16:12.220
You know. "What are
we going to do?"

00:16:12.220 --> 00:16:13.940
And so they issued an RFP --

00:16:13.940 --> 00:16:15.830
I find the federal
government does that,

00:16:15.830 --> 00:16:17.130
agencies do that a lot.

00:16:17.130 --> 00:16:19.640
If they don't know
anything, they do an RFP.

00:16:19.640 --> 00:16:23.010
So, I successfully
got a contract

00:16:23.010 --> 00:16:24.600
to provide technical assistance

00:16:24.600 --> 00:16:29.520
and training all throughout
the country, including Alaska,

00:16:29.520 --> 00:16:32.380
to these places who had
never had this money,

00:16:32.380 --> 00:16:33.990
they didn't know what to
do, they didn't know nothing

00:16:33.990 --> 00:16:38.290
about libraries, so I
went to states and areas

00:16:38.290 --> 00:16:40.670
and held workshops to
write their grants,

00:16:40.670 --> 00:16:43.670
and I did a core
collection for them.

00:16:43.670 --> 00:16:47.620
One of my problems with
places that start libraries

00:16:47.620 --> 00:16:50.340
and don't know what they're
doing is what they buy

00:16:50.340 --> 00:16:53.320
and what they purchase, because
they go to a local bookstore

00:16:53.320 --> 00:16:56.180
and "That cover looks good"
and "that cover looks good."

00:16:56.180 --> 00:17:00.500
So, I tried to do some quality
basic stuff, and that was well.

00:17:00.500 --> 00:17:04.620
Then, I negotiated with a
vendor, or multiple vendors:

00:17:04.620 --> 00:17:07.890
"Okay, what discount are
you going to give them

00:17:07.890 --> 00:17:09.350
if they buy through you?"

00:17:09.350 --> 00:17:10.950
And they had never done that.

00:17:10.950 --> 00:17:12.630
They don't know how to do that.

00:17:12.630 --> 00:17:16.050
So, just typical library stuff.

00:17:16.050 --> 00:17:20.010
That was funded for a year.

00:17:20.010 --> 00:17:23.950
The Department of Ed couldn't
fund things more than one year,

00:17:23.950 --> 00:17:28.680
but they said, "I promise you,
we'll do it for three years."

00:17:28.680 --> 00:17:32.410
"Okay." During the first year,

00:17:32.410 --> 00:17:35.330
we got a presidential
-- new president.

00:17:35.330 --> 00:17:38.190
He appointed new, was going
to appoint a new person head

00:17:38.190 --> 00:17:41.320
of Department of Ed,
who said to me --

00:17:41.320 --> 00:17:44.110
I can remember, it's like
when Kennedy was shot

00:17:44.110 --> 00:17:46.210
and you remember
exactly where you were.

00:17:46.210 --> 00:17:49.200
I remember exactly where I was
when that woman came up to me

00:17:49.200 --> 00:17:51.090
and said -- it was
in the Palmer House,

00:17:51.090 --> 00:17:53.830
in front of the elevators.

00:17:53.830 --> 00:17:57.920
She said, "Oh, by the way" --
she wasn't even in office yet --

00:17:57.920 --> 00:18:02.050
"I am not going to fund your
-- " I call it TRAILS Program.

00:18:02.050 --> 00:18:06.830
"I'm not going to fund it
because -- " I said, "Why?

00:18:06.830 --> 00:18:08.790
You don't even know
what we're doing."

00:18:08.790 --> 00:18:11.270
"Well, I have five years
to make a name for myself,

00:18:11.270 --> 00:18:13.530
and it's not going
to be with Indians."

00:18:13.530 --> 00:18:14.830
&gt;&gt; Guha Shankar: Whoa.

00:18:14.830 --> 00:18:16.130
&gt;&gt; Dr. Lotsee Patterson:
You know what I thought?

00:18:16.130 --> 00:18:18.660
"Where is Bob Woodward
when you need him?"

00:18:18.660 --> 00:18:20.920
But, she did -- I
mean, she got in office

00:18:20.920 --> 00:18:23.030
and she cut the funding
for that, and --

00:18:23.030 --> 00:18:26.080
but there's a happy
end to that story too.

00:18:26.080 --> 00:18:27.380
&gt;&gt; Guha Shankar: But tell us

00:18:27.380 --> 00:18:28.680
about the TRAILS
Program, if you would.

00:18:28.680 --> 00:18:29.980
What does that stand for?

00:18:29.980 --> 00:18:31.280
TRAILS?

00:18:31.280 --> 00:18:33.400
&gt;&gt; Dr. Lotsee Patterson: TRAILS
is the acronym, is Training,

00:18:33.400 --> 00:18:39.970
T-R, and Assistance, A, for
Indian Library Services.

00:18:39.970 --> 00:18:43.430
And it's still talked about, and
I still hear testimony every now

00:18:43.430 --> 00:18:45.220
and then, "We need TRAILS."

00:18:45.220 --> 00:18:49.680
I had an 800 number, so they
could call, ask anything,

00:18:49.680 --> 00:18:54.340
I manned it 12 hours a day.

00:18:54.340 --> 00:18:58.880
And we got -- mostly what they
wanted was basic information.

00:18:58.880 --> 00:19:05.180
You know, "How do weA" and they
still need that, even today.

00:19:05.180 --> 00:19:09.260
And I hear people saying,
"We need TRAILS back,"

00:19:09.260 --> 00:19:11.140
you know, "We need our TRAILS."

00:19:11.140 --> 00:19:12.920
And I'm working on that.

00:19:12.920 --> 00:19:15.220
I'm working on that.

00:19:15.220 --> 00:19:17.630
But it has been enormously
successful,

00:19:17.630 --> 00:19:22.240
and I'm extremely happy that we
have libraries on reservations

00:19:22.240 --> 00:19:24.230
where there were none.

00:19:24.230 --> 00:19:26.990
Hundreds and thousands of
Indian kids have been able

00:19:26.990 --> 00:19:28.620
to go to a library.

00:19:28.620 --> 00:19:31.870
One other happy note
I'll insert is

00:19:31.870 --> 00:19:34.640
when the Gates Foundation
made an announcement

00:19:34.640 --> 00:19:36.090
that they were going to --

00:19:36.090 --> 00:19:38.150
you know, they have
different focuses.

00:19:38.150 --> 00:19:39.450
They were going to focus

00:19:39.450 --> 00:19:42.600
on small public libraries
for their grants.

00:19:42.600 --> 00:19:45.790
Ah! So, I call Gates Foundation.

00:19:45.790 --> 00:19:48.590
I said, "Don't forget
tribal libraries."

00:19:48.590 --> 00:19:51.150
And they respond, "Oh, they're
part of the state libraries and,

00:19:51.150 --> 00:19:52.660
you know, we'll do
-- " "No, no, no.

00:19:52.660 --> 00:19:54.340
No, they're not."

00:19:54.340 --> 00:19:57.510
"Well, how do we know where
they are if they're not

00:19:57.510 --> 00:19:59.010
on the list of the state?"

00:19:59.010 --> 00:20:01.660
"Oh, I'll be happy
to send you a list.

00:20:01.660 --> 00:20:03.370
Names, addresses,
and phone numbers."

00:20:03.370 --> 00:20:07.140
And sure enough, that took root.

00:20:07.140 --> 00:20:10.760
And then it was like
Columbus discovered America.

00:20:10.760 --> 00:20:13.510
Gates discovered
tribal libraries.

00:20:13.510 --> 00:20:16.060
That's okay, I don't care.

00:20:16.060 --> 00:20:19.100
But what they did
was put computers

00:20:19.100 --> 00:20:21.970
in those tribal libraries,
sent trainers

00:20:21.970 --> 00:20:24.800
down to train them how
to use the computers.

00:20:24.800 --> 00:20:28.400
So, I want to give Gates
credit too for their --

00:20:28.400 --> 00:20:31.220
you know, that only lasted a
few years, but it's wonderful.

00:20:31.220 --> 00:20:33.260
&gt;&gt; Guha Shankar: And when
would that have been, Lotsee?

00:20:33.260 --> 00:20:34.560
&gt;&gt; Dr. Lotsee Patterson: When?

00:20:34.560 --> 00:20:35.860
&gt;&gt; Guha Shankar: Mm-hmm.

00:20:35.860 --> 00:20:37.160
&gt;&gt; Dr. Lotsee Patterson:
I can't remember.

00:20:37.160 --> 00:20:39.580
Must have been in the '80s.

00:20:39.580 --> 00:20:40.880
&gt;&gt; Guha Shankar: Okay.

00:20:40.880 --> 00:20:42.180
&gt;&gt; Dr. Lotsee Patterson: And
you know, they only fund things

00:20:42.180 --> 00:20:45.070
for a while, but those computers
that Gates funded and put

00:20:45.070 --> 00:20:47.390
out in those libraries, many
of them are still there.

00:20:47.390 --> 00:20:50.140
I had one, or probably
more librarians

00:20:50.140 --> 00:20:53.060
that actually never learned
how to use the computer,

00:20:53.060 --> 00:20:56.690
but they've moved on, and the
younger ones have taken to it.

00:20:56.690 --> 00:21:00.200
And now, when I go
out to Indian country,

00:21:00.200 --> 00:21:02.530
and I go to those libraries,

00:21:02.530 --> 00:21:07.970
I say computers have
leveled the playing field.

00:21:07.970 --> 00:21:09.990
Now, those people 50 miles

00:21:09.990 --> 00:21:14.220
from anywhere can have the
same access to information

00:21:14.220 --> 00:21:16.850
that they have in
downtown Albuquerque.

00:21:16.850 --> 00:21:19.190
It's absolutely been
such a boon,

00:21:19.190 --> 00:21:22.990
and it's bringing people in,
because the people in the --

00:21:22.990 --> 00:21:25.920
I'm talking mostly about the
Pueblos, but this is true

00:21:25.920 --> 00:21:27.490
in Indian country in general:

00:21:27.490 --> 00:21:29.580
they do not have
access to the Internet.

00:21:29.580 --> 00:21:32.880
Even if they do, they
couldn't pay for it.

00:21:32.880 --> 00:21:34.190
They don't have computers.

00:21:34.190 --> 00:21:38.190
So, they can go to their tribal
library and use the computer.

00:21:38.190 --> 00:21:39.780
And they do.

00:21:39.780 --> 00:21:41.870
And it's brought people
into the libraries

00:21:41.870 --> 00:21:44.860
that would have never
been in there before.

00:21:44.860 --> 00:21:51.460
&gt;&gt; Judith Gray: So, this was
all prior to your actually being

00:21:51.460 --> 00:21:54.680
at University of Oklahoma
in the library school, yes?

00:21:54.680 --> 00:21:56.880
&gt;&gt; Dr. Lotsee Patterson:
Well, yes, but I continued,

00:21:56.880 --> 00:22:01.340
as I still do, to
try to do what I can.

00:22:01.340 --> 00:22:04.940
I still get calls from
people asking for help.

00:22:04.940 --> 00:22:08.070
Now I get calls about
"Which software automation,

00:22:08.070 --> 00:22:10.720
library automation
software should we buy?"

00:22:10.720 --> 00:22:14.140
I have to, you know, I
have to -- I never say no.

00:22:14.140 --> 00:22:18.000
So, I try to find
somebody in their state

00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:21.470
that can give them
assistance or information,

00:22:21.470 --> 00:22:23.060
and I'll give them
what they have.

00:22:23.060 --> 00:22:26.340
I mostly -- you know,
library journals,

00:22:26.340 --> 00:22:27.890
some might publish
just once a year,

00:22:27.890 --> 00:22:30.110
the library software companies,

00:22:30.110 --> 00:22:31.900
so I'll provide them
information.

00:22:31.900 --> 00:22:35.280
I never promote one
company over another.

00:22:35.280 --> 00:22:38.710
But there's still many
things that can be done.

00:22:38.710 --> 00:22:41.310
&gt;&gt; Judith Gray: Well, I know
that you are funding, as well,

00:22:41.310 --> 00:22:44.480
a scholarship for
Native students wanting

00:22:44.480 --> 00:22:45.780
to go to library school.

00:22:45.780 --> 00:22:47.080
&gt;&gt; Dr. Lotsee Patterson:
That's right.

00:22:47.080 --> 00:22:48.380
That's what I did at
the university level,

00:22:48.380 --> 00:22:51.170
is I write grants
to get fellowships

00:22:51.170 --> 00:22:53.930
and recruited American
Indians to library school.

00:22:53.930 --> 00:22:55.520
And I'm so happy, I had --

00:22:55.520 --> 00:22:59.570
two of the seven Montana tribal
colleges were my graduates,

00:22:59.570 --> 00:23:02.200
in Fort Peck, and Blackfeet.

00:23:02.200 --> 00:23:06.910
Yeah, I call myself the
mother of tribal libraries.

00:23:06.910 --> 00:23:09.960
And like any good mother --

00:23:09.960 --> 00:23:13.310
I do have some Jewish
blood too, I must tell you.

00:23:13.310 --> 00:23:14.970
My DNA says I do.

00:23:14.970 --> 00:23:18.410
So, I compare myself to a
Jewish grandmother who says,

00:23:18.410 --> 00:23:21.180
"This [inaudible]
help these libraries."

00:23:21.180 --> 00:23:27.660
And I never miss an opportunity
to try to put things together.

00:23:27.660 --> 00:23:31.680
I'm a connector, I'm a
networker, and sometimes,

00:23:31.680 --> 00:23:35.930
just little things pay off well.

00:23:35.930 --> 00:23:39.940
&gt;&gt; Judith Gray: Both TRAILS
and then ATALM, though,

00:23:39.940 --> 00:23:44.800
had University of Oklahoma
connections, Associations

00:23:44.800 --> 00:23:47.190
for Tribal Archives
Libraries and Museums.

00:23:47.190 --> 00:23:48.490
&gt;&gt; Dr. Lotsee Patterson: Yeah.

00:23:48.490 --> 00:23:51.100
&gt;&gt; Judith Gray: So did you
help bridge that as well?

00:23:51.100 --> 00:23:52.930
&gt;&gt; Dr. Lotsee Patterson:
Not directly.

00:23:52.930 --> 00:23:56.160
The Department of Ed --
there was some restructuring

00:23:56.160 --> 00:23:58.220
and I forget when it happened,

00:23:58.220 --> 00:24:04.310
but they took the tribal library
money out of Department of Ed

00:24:04.310 --> 00:24:07.790
and they formed, I
think it was a --

00:24:07.790 --> 00:24:09.800
when they rewrite
the legislation,

00:24:09.800 --> 00:24:13.010
and they formed this IMLS,
Institute for Library

00:24:13.010 --> 00:24:17.490
and Museum Services, and they
moved that money over to IMLS,

00:24:17.490 --> 00:24:20.440
who's administered,
for some years now.

00:24:20.440 --> 00:24:23.550
And so, it's under their
-- and they have --

00:24:23.550 --> 00:24:26.780
somebody asked me why
I didn't do this in,

00:24:26.780 --> 00:24:28.830
you know, the legislation.

00:24:28.830 --> 00:24:33.340
I said, "It's very hard to get
a new piece of legislation."

00:24:33.340 --> 00:24:35.860
And Mary Alice Reszetar,
National Commission,

00:24:35.860 --> 00:24:39.750
very clever: "We're not going
to make new legislation;

00:24:39.750 --> 00:24:43.180
we're going to take a
title under another act

00:24:43.180 --> 00:24:47.910
that has been named
but never funded.

00:24:47.910 --> 00:24:50.860
So, we're going to
take that title

00:24:50.860 --> 00:24:55.160
and rename it Library
Services for American Indians,

00:24:55.160 --> 00:24:58.940
but we'll tie the funding
for that to these others

00:24:58.940 --> 00:25:03.370
that are funded and it has
to be percent of the funding

00:25:03.370 --> 00:25:04.790
that you give to those."

00:25:04.790 --> 00:25:07.630
Very clever move, because now
they could not leave the tribal

00:25:07.630 --> 00:25:09.940
library title out.

00:25:09.940 --> 00:25:14.520
And this is the money that goes
to state libraries, and the,

00:25:14.520 --> 00:25:16.430
we knew when that
happened, it was passed,

00:25:16.430 --> 00:25:18.900
the state libraries are
going to be very unhappy

00:25:18.900 --> 00:25:22.500
because they had always
had flow-through money,

00:25:22.500 --> 00:25:24.940
and Mary Alice, again,
said, "No, we're not going

00:25:24.940 --> 00:25:26.290
to do flow-through
money with this

00:25:26.290 --> 00:25:27.660
because the states
have not worked

00:25:27.660 --> 00:25:29.410
with their tribal
libraries, many of them.

00:25:29.410 --> 00:25:33.810
So, we're going to direct
Washington to the tribe."

00:25:33.810 --> 00:25:35.540
That was a first.

00:25:35.540 --> 00:25:39.470
And so, Mary Alice is
responsible for that, and again,

00:25:39.470 --> 00:25:41.230
they don't have the staffing

00:25:41.230 --> 00:25:44.280
that can provide the
direct technical assistance

00:25:44.280 --> 00:25:48.610
and training, and it's
usually very basic things,

00:25:48.610 --> 00:25:51.710
like what library automation
system should we use?

00:25:51.710 --> 00:25:55.120
Where can we get
trained for that?

00:25:55.120 --> 00:25:57.870
They don't know about
buying from vendors,

00:25:57.870 --> 00:26:00.780
you can get a 20% discount.

00:26:00.780 --> 00:26:05.050
They don't know -- they don't
have access to reviewing tools.

00:26:05.050 --> 00:26:08.380
And, you know, I wouldn't
say Google or Amazon,

00:26:08.380 --> 00:26:10.650
that's not a reviewing tool.

00:26:10.650 --> 00:26:13.460
But they think it is.

00:26:13.460 --> 00:26:16.470
So, I still see many issues
that I'm concerned about:

00:26:16.470 --> 00:26:18.820
the quality of the
material they're buying,

00:26:18.820 --> 00:26:22.310
continuing training,
and of course,

00:26:22.310 --> 00:26:24.960
always there's the basic
question of funding.

00:26:24.960 --> 00:26:28.840
IMLS just announced this
fall that they were going

00:26:28.840 --> 00:26:32.690
to up the basic grants
up to $10,000 a year.

00:26:32.690 --> 00:26:35.110
So, that means, these
libraries have, you know,

00:26:35.110 --> 00:26:38.050
that's a basic they
can count on.

00:26:38.050 --> 00:26:42.520
That's enough to enable
them to continue to operate.

00:26:42.520 --> 00:26:47.870
They have trouble -- I was in
Jemez this spring, this fall,

00:26:47.870 --> 00:26:50.250
and visited them,
and they were --

00:26:50.250 --> 00:26:53.690
their lights were going
to be shut off, you know,

00:26:53.690 --> 00:26:58.980
and I took some people with me,
and I said to them, "We're going

00:26:58.980 --> 00:27:03.010
to make a donation before
you leave this room.

00:27:03.010 --> 00:27:06.420
We are going to make a
donation to this library."

00:27:06.420 --> 00:27:09.060
And we got just enough
to pay their light bill

00:27:09.060 --> 00:27:10.710
and get the, kept the lights on.

00:27:10.710 --> 00:27:14.540
So, I work in nefarious ways.

00:27:14.540 --> 00:27:17.890
But always for a good cause.

00:27:17.890 --> 00:27:20.050
&gt;&gt; Guha Shankar: So that's
a kind of a very, you know,

00:27:20.050 --> 00:27:23.100
drastic aspect of what's
happening with libraries,

00:27:23.100 --> 00:27:26.430
which are about literally to
have their lights shut off,

00:27:26.430 --> 00:27:29.300
but is there a spectrum of
those kinds of libraries,

00:27:29.300 --> 00:27:34.090
ranging from really impoverished
to very, very well-endowed, or?

00:27:34.090 --> 00:27:35.390
&gt;&gt; Dr. Lotsee Patterson: Yes,

00:27:35.390 --> 00:27:37.780
and the best tribal
libraries you will find are

00:27:37.780 --> 00:27:43.610
in the tribal colleges, and
most of them have MLS graduates,

00:27:43.610 --> 00:27:45.540
or they're going to school.

00:27:45.540 --> 00:27:48.530
So, they have really
made a difference.

00:27:48.530 --> 00:27:54.120
The Dakotas -- Montana has
seven tribes, and at least three

00:27:54.120 --> 00:27:55.420
of them have tribal colleges.

00:27:55.420 --> 00:27:57.100
Four have tribal colleges.

00:27:57.100 --> 00:28:00.020
So, they're in pretty
good shape.

00:28:00.020 --> 00:28:03.580
But the other thing
they need is networking.

00:28:03.580 --> 00:28:05.880
They need to be able
to talk to one another.

00:28:05.880 --> 00:28:09.160
They need to know who they can
call if they have a question

00:28:09.160 --> 00:28:10.870
that won't be intimidating.

00:28:10.870 --> 00:28:12.170
I have to tell you,

00:28:12.170 --> 00:28:15.150
many librarians are
very intimidating.

00:28:15.150 --> 00:28:17.930
When you go into a library
and they look down their nose

00:28:17.930 --> 00:28:20.100
at you, like "Are
you stupid or what?"

00:28:20.100 --> 00:28:23.380
You know, I mean,
now you can laugh,

00:28:23.380 --> 00:28:25.670
but I feel that way sometimes.

00:28:25.670 --> 00:28:27.790
You know, I've been
in libraries where --

00:28:27.790 --> 00:28:29.570
because they get tired of
answering the same questions,

00:28:29.570 --> 00:28:30.880
like "Where's the restroom?"

00:28:30.880 --> 00:28:33.010
And, so --

00:28:33.010 --> 00:28:34.310
&gt;&gt; Judith Gray: Here, too.

00:28:34.310 --> 00:28:35.610
&gt;&gt; Dr. Lotsee Patterson: But
they -- with Indian people,

00:28:35.610 --> 00:28:39.770
they're so sensitive, not
just to words, but to looks,

00:28:39.770 --> 00:28:44.450
to body language, to attitude,
and they can be turned off

00:28:44.450 --> 00:28:48.030
like that and they
will never come back.

00:28:48.030 --> 00:28:51.610
But I think, more and more, now
that the Institute of Museum

00:28:51.610 --> 00:28:55.310
and Library Services is
funding an annual conference

00:28:55.310 --> 00:28:57.540
to bring tribal librarians,
archivists,

00:28:57.540 --> 00:29:01.090
and museum people together,
and that's wonderful.

00:29:01.090 --> 00:29:04.360
And I know you've had
representatives there.

00:29:04.360 --> 00:29:07.490
And it's wonderful because
they meet you there,

00:29:07.490 --> 00:29:09.960
the tribal libraries and
archivists do, and they're not,

00:29:09.960 --> 00:29:12.200
then, afraid to call you.

00:29:12.200 --> 00:29:15.310
And they're not intimidated
to ask you what --

00:29:15.310 --> 00:29:19.530
they don't want to ask a stupid
question, because you won't --

00:29:19.530 --> 00:29:22.910
they don't feel that way about
you because they know you now,

00:29:22.910 --> 00:29:24.530
and that's very important.

00:29:24.530 --> 00:29:26.590
&gt;&gt; Guha Shankar: So, it
seems to me this training

00:29:26.590 --> 00:29:29.190
that you're providing for Native
librarians might also be applied

00:29:29.190 --> 00:29:30.550
to non-Native librarians.

00:29:30.550 --> 00:29:31.950
&gt;&gt; Dr. Lotsee Patterson: Yeah.

00:29:31.950 --> 00:29:37.850
Well, I believe very much in the
graduate degree for librarians,

00:29:37.850 --> 00:29:40.290
but I know it's unrealistic.

00:29:40.290 --> 00:29:46.820
And these people in the tribal
settings know things that --

00:29:46.820 --> 00:29:50.270
you can train a person with a
Ph.D and they won't know some

00:29:50.270 --> 00:29:55.730
of the things these people know,
that they need to be successful.

00:29:55.730 --> 00:30:00.450
And I've said, more
than once, you can train

00:30:00.450 --> 00:30:04.090
a Native person to be a
librarian, but it's very hard

00:30:04.090 --> 00:30:09.500
to train a non-native to
work in a tribal library,

00:30:09.500 --> 00:30:15.130
because there's so much culture
behind everything they do

00:30:15.130 --> 00:30:17.500
and you know, people
don't recognize,

00:30:17.500 --> 00:30:18.800
they don't realize it.

00:30:18.800 --> 00:30:23.050
I should give you a bibliography
attached to this interview

00:30:23.050 --> 00:30:28.070
of some things I've written
and express those feelings.

00:30:28.070 --> 00:30:32.560
&gt;&gt; Judith Gray: If I
can move from that,

00:30:32.560 --> 00:30:36.310
you have graciously given us
an interesting collection,

00:30:36.310 --> 00:30:39.460
which was a, sort of an
annotated discography

00:30:39.460 --> 00:30:42.200
of Native American recordings.

00:30:42.200 --> 00:30:44.990
I'm wondering how that
project came about.

00:30:44.990 --> 00:30:47.450
&gt;&gt; Dr. Lotsee Patterson: Now,
say that again, a little louder?

00:30:47.450 --> 00:30:48.750
&gt;&gt; Judith Gray: Sure.

00:30:48.750 --> 00:30:50.820
You've given us this collection,

00:30:50.820 --> 00:30:54.470
this annotated discography
of recordings.

00:30:54.470 --> 00:30:55.770
&gt;&gt; Dr. Lotsee Patterson:
Oh, yes, yes.

00:30:55.770 --> 00:30:57.070
&gt;&gt; Judith Gray: And I
was wondering how that,

00:30:57.070 --> 00:30:58.370
how did that come about?

00:30:58.370 --> 00:30:59.670
&gt;&gt; Dr. Lotsee Patterson:
Well, because professors have

00:30:59.670 --> 00:31:01.240
to do research and
publish, that's the truth.

00:31:01.240 --> 00:31:02.540
It's not that we want to;

00:31:02.540 --> 00:31:05.380
it's that we have
to, to keep our job.

00:31:05.380 --> 00:31:09.360
And in fact, I've done that
in my professional career,

00:31:09.360 --> 00:31:12.760
but at a research institution
like University of Oklahoma,

00:31:12.760 --> 00:31:15.670
you have to publish and
you have to do research,

00:31:15.670 --> 00:31:19.030
and I've always focused on the
American Indian library stuff,

00:31:19.030 --> 00:31:25.130
and I've been told, "Don't do
that because that won't get you,

00:31:25.130 --> 00:31:29.150
you know, what you need to be
promoted," to which I've said,

00:31:29.150 --> 00:31:31.550
"Well, I'm going
to do it anyway."

00:31:31.550 --> 00:31:33.970
And I've proceeded to
do so, and I got tenure

00:31:33.970 --> 00:31:36.060
and I got full professor,
so there.

00:31:36.060 --> 00:31:40.230
But I know what they meant.

00:31:40.230 --> 00:31:44.000
It was all, the places I've
published have not been

00:31:44.000 --> 00:31:46.820
mainstream always,
but it's my audience,

00:31:46.820 --> 00:31:50.930
it's the things they read,
like Tribal College Journal.

00:31:50.930 --> 00:31:55.770
But anyway, that's, yeah.

00:31:55.770 --> 00:32:00.400
But in the context of my
position, another colleague

00:32:00.400 --> 00:32:06.610
and I, she was a Ph.D
music professor and we --

00:32:06.610 --> 00:32:09.240
I always look for gaps in --

00:32:09.240 --> 00:32:12.310
music is a big thing
in the communities

00:32:12.310 --> 00:32:13.960
and people don't know this

00:32:13.960 --> 00:32:17.350
but certain songs
belong to certain people.

00:32:17.350 --> 00:32:20.050
"They're my family's
songs; you have no right

00:32:20.050 --> 00:32:23.160
to sing them unless I
give you permission."

00:32:23.160 --> 00:32:25.470
And so, commercial
recordings and,

00:32:25.470 --> 00:32:28.450
there are many complications
with that.

00:32:28.450 --> 00:32:30.830
But she and I took
a look at the field

00:32:30.830 --> 00:32:34.410
and there's two major producers
of Indian music: Indian House

00:32:34.410 --> 00:32:36.800
in Taos, the other
one's in Phoenix,

00:32:36.800 --> 00:32:38.130
I can't remember the name of.

00:32:38.130 --> 00:32:39.430
&gt;&gt; Judith Gray: Canyon.

00:32:39.430 --> 00:32:40.730
&gt;&gt; Dr. Lotsee Patterson:
What is it?

00:32:40.730 --> 00:32:42.030
&gt;&gt; Judith Gray: Canyon Records.

00:32:42.030 --> 00:32:43.330
&gt;&gt; Guha Shankar: Canyon Records.

00:32:43.330 --> 00:32:44.630
&gt;&gt; Dr. Lotsee Patterson:
Canyon, that's right.

00:32:44.630 --> 00:32:47.600
So I went to Canyon and I
spent time in their facility

00:32:47.600 --> 00:32:51.760
in the University of Mexico and
we took the, what do you call --

00:32:51.760 --> 00:32:56.590
she was the music expert -- off
the, all of the information off

00:32:56.590 --> 00:33:01.330
of the recordings and we
put together a discography.

00:33:01.330 --> 00:33:04.300
There had been one up
to like 1940-something

00:33:04.300 --> 00:33:07.670
of commercially produced
Indian music.

00:33:07.670 --> 00:33:10.420
Though we just focused
on the Southwest,

00:33:10.420 --> 00:33:15.010
but tried to put together a
comprehensive list of everything

00:33:15.010 --> 00:33:19.570
that had been commercially
produced from like 1956 I think

00:33:19.570 --> 00:33:22.940
to '94, that gap, that era.

00:33:22.940 --> 00:33:25.190
But my colleague,
who had all the data

00:33:25.190 --> 00:33:28.030
on her computer, lost it.

00:33:28.030 --> 00:33:31.970
So I had one print copy,
which I brought to you.

00:33:31.970 --> 00:33:34.100
That's how I met you, in fact.

00:33:34.100 --> 00:33:37.980
I brought, I think, I
brought that manuscript.

00:33:37.980 --> 00:33:42.010
We had a book contract
but we didn't fulfill it

00:33:42.010 --> 00:33:43.790
so I think it's yours.

00:33:43.790 --> 00:33:45.140
Do with as you wish,

00:33:45.140 --> 00:33:50.510
but it fills the gap
of what was produced.

00:33:50.510 --> 00:33:53.670
We learned a lot in the process.

00:33:53.670 --> 00:33:56.000
&gt;&gt; Judith Gray: Was she also
at University of Oklahoma?

00:33:56.000 --> 00:33:57.400
&gt;&gt; Dr. Lotsee Patterson:
Yes, yes.

00:33:57.400 --> 00:34:04.850
She was a temporary appointment
but she was ill and before,

00:34:04.850 --> 00:34:06.900
you know, I was,
and I went to Canada

00:34:06.900 --> 00:34:08.700
to be a visiting
professor at the University

00:34:08.700 --> 00:34:13.010
of British Columbia during this
era, so I was not there to say,

00:34:13.010 --> 00:34:18.920
"Give me a backup copy," and
when I came back from Vancouver,

00:34:18.920 --> 00:34:23.180
she had gone and lost,
she lost all the --

00:34:23.180 --> 00:34:27.860
and that's a lesson in what
not to do with computers.

00:34:27.860 --> 00:34:29.160
&gt;&gt; Guha Shankar:
I wanted to follow

00:34:29.160 --> 00:34:30.460
up on something you
just said, Lotsee,

00:34:30.460 --> 00:34:33.980
about some materials just
aren't even meant to be heard

00:34:33.980 --> 00:34:35.820
by non-family members.

00:34:35.820 --> 00:34:37.430
That brings up the
broader question

00:34:37.430 --> 00:34:40.390
of the Native American
protocols, which were introduced

00:34:40.390 --> 00:34:42.290
about ten years ago, which was

00:34:42.290 --> 00:34:46.270
about how non-Native
institutions ought to look after

00:34:46.270 --> 00:34:50.810
and caretake Native materials
in their own collections.

00:34:50.810 --> 00:34:53.460
Can you talk about that a little
bit and what your reaction

00:34:53.460 --> 00:34:55.900
to that set of protocols was?

00:34:55.900 --> 00:34:57.460
&gt;&gt; Dr. Lotsee Patterson: Well,
actually I'm glad you mentioned

00:34:57.460 --> 00:34:59.860
that because a librarian

00:34:59.860 --> 00:35:03.190
at the Northern Arizona
University put together a small

00:35:03.190 --> 00:35:07.360
group, I think 15 of us,
to write some protocols.

00:35:07.360 --> 00:35:11.590
Not just for music, but for
anything intellectual property

00:35:11.590 --> 00:35:16.080
that belonged to Indians,
whether design or a song or a,

00:35:16.080 --> 00:35:19.630
you know, many elements
of that, and now,

00:35:19.630 --> 00:35:22.150
so we put together
a list of protocols

00:35:22.150 --> 00:35:23.750
and that's still available.

00:35:23.750 --> 00:35:26.050
There's a group now at the
University of Oklahoma,

00:35:26.050 --> 00:35:29.700
the Sam Noble Museum,
working on a project.

00:35:29.700 --> 00:35:31.780
And what they're
doing is trying to go

00:35:31.780 --> 00:35:34.880
out to the Indian
communities and get music

00:35:34.880 --> 00:35:37.420
that was recorded
but not commercially.

00:35:37.420 --> 00:35:40.630
They're in closets and on, you
know, Uncle John's back porch.

00:35:40.630 --> 00:35:44.110
And so, Oklahoma,
University of Oklahoma,

00:35:44.110 --> 00:35:46.950
Sam Noble Museum is
working on that right now.

00:35:46.950 --> 00:35:49.140
But the protocols
are so interesting,

00:35:49.140 --> 00:35:50.950
and when you find people
who have never worked

00:35:50.950 --> 00:35:55.810
with a Native group,
they don't have a clue,

00:35:55.810 --> 00:35:59.450
and I think the broader term
now being used is cultural

00:35:59.450 --> 00:36:03.140
expressions, which covers a lot.

00:36:03.140 --> 00:36:06.030
I mean, I've done some work
in New Zealand with Maoris

00:36:06.030 --> 00:36:09.140
and they are really leading the
charge with people taking their,

00:36:09.140 --> 00:36:14.410
even tattoos, the design, so
hopefully we've created a lot

00:36:14.410 --> 00:36:17.270
of awareness and, you
know, T-shirts that used

00:36:17.270 --> 00:36:19.980
to copy Indian designs.

00:36:19.980 --> 00:36:24.320
But you at L-C are kind of ahead

00:36:24.320 --> 00:36:26.620
of that right now;
you're ahead of that.

00:36:26.620 --> 00:36:27.920
&gt;&gt; Dr. Judith Gray:
We're trying.

00:36:27.920 --> 00:36:29.430
&gt;&gt; Dr. Lotsee Patterson: Well,
it's a lot to keep up with.

00:36:29.430 --> 00:36:32.650
If nothing else but
create awareness.

00:36:32.650 --> 00:36:35.730
Hey, you people out here in the
street, you don't have a right

00:36:35.730 --> 00:36:38.460
to take that and put
it on your T-shirt.

00:36:38.460 --> 00:36:43.370
It's insulting, for one
thing; it's degrading.

00:36:43.370 --> 00:36:47.410
So, good luck to you
all in your work.

00:36:47.410 --> 00:36:53.130
But there's many, many more
facets to this whole thing,

00:36:53.130 --> 00:36:55.710
and I'm so happy
that LC has you two.

00:36:55.710 --> 00:36:57.010
&gt;&gt; Guha Shankar: Thank you.

00:36:57.010 --> 00:36:58.310
&gt;&gt; Judith Gray: Thank you.

00:36:58.310 --> 00:36:59.610
&gt;&gt; Dr. Lotsee Patterson:
Because you understand.

00:36:59.610 --> 00:37:00.910
&gt;&gt; Judith Gray: Right.

00:37:00.910 --> 00:37:02.210
&gt;&gt; Dr. Lotsee Patterson:

00:37:02.210 --> 00:37:03.510
You understand the
issues and the problems.

00:37:03.510 --> 00:37:04.810
&gt;&gt; Guha Shankar:
So, moving slightly

00:37:04.810 --> 00:37:06.110
in a different direction.

00:37:06.110 --> 00:37:07.410
Today, you came to the
library and you met

00:37:07.410 --> 00:37:12.120
with our recently installed
library, librarian of Congress

00:37:12.120 --> 00:37:14.850
and the national
librarian, Dr. Carla Hayden.

00:37:14.850 --> 00:37:17.260
Can you talk a little bit -- not
actually giving away any details

00:37:17.260 --> 00:37:19.570
of the meeting but how did
you come to know Dr. Hayden

00:37:19.570 --> 00:37:21.370
and what's your association
been over the years?

00:37:21.370 --> 00:37:23.080
&gt;&gt; Dr. Lotsee Patterson:
Well, I've known Dr. Hayden

00:37:23.080 --> 00:37:24.380
for a number of years.

00:37:24.380 --> 00:37:27.010
We served on the ALA
Committee for Accreditation,

00:37:27.010 --> 00:37:30.250
I think that was the '80s
maybe, I don't remember.

00:37:30.250 --> 00:37:32.760
But our paths have
crossed a number of times.

00:37:32.760 --> 00:37:37.020
She was on the IMLS board when
I was on, but I've come to know

00:37:37.020 --> 00:37:41.520
and respect her and can't
tell you how overjoyed I

00:37:41.520 --> 00:37:45.080
and many other librarians are
to have her in this position.

00:37:45.080 --> 00:37:50.570
I met with her today briefly
because I explained to her

00:37:50.570 --> 00:37:55.050
that when one of your own, and
I consider her one of our own,

00:37:55.050 --> 00:38:01.260
achieves a high, makes a high
achievement or high status,

00:38:01.260 --> 00:38:03.890
it's tradition in many
Indian communities

00:38:03.890 --> 00:38:06.310
to gift them, to
give them gifts.

00:38:06.310 --> 00:38:08.930
So I brought her a gift today.

00:38:08.930 --> 00:38:12.680
Happy to know she
liked Indian jewelry,

00:38:12.680 --> 00:38:14.810
so I brought her
something from Navajo.

00:38:14.810 --> 00:38:17.960
Comanches do beadwork
and I see her more

00:38:17.960 --> 00:38:20.010
as a silver and turquoise
person.

00:38:20.010 --> 00:38:23.120
But we talked briefly
and very candidly

00:38:23.120 --> 00:38:25.770
about some needs
in Indian country.

00:38:25.770 --> 00:38:27.550
I didn't even have to
bring up the subject;

00:38:27.550 --> 00:38:32.540
she broached the subject
about what LC might do,

00:38:32.540 --> 00:38:35.810
so I've got some homework.

00:38:35.810 --> 00:38:39.290
I'm going to -- and I'll be
calling on some other people,

00:38:39.290 --> 00:38:42.240
see what we can put
together that can make use

00:38:42.240 --> 00:38:45.160
of the LC's vast resources.

00:38:45.160 --> 00:38:49.180
I'm a big one to
put things together.

00:38:49.180 --> 00:38:51.760
I told you earlier,
don't tell me you have

00:38:51.760 --> 00:38:55.270
to have money for
it; just do it.

00:38:55.270 --> 00:38:57.750
So that's where I'm starting.

00:38:57.750 --> 00:39:02.540
I think we can look at various
services and places here

00:39:02.540 --> 00:39:08.700
that might piggyback, cooperate,
collaborate, and with IMLS too,

00:39:08.700 --> 00:39:14.880
I want to talk to them and
maybe get a revived TRAILS

00:39:14.880 --> 00:39:16.590
project back.

00:39:16.590 --> 00:39:21.470
Something, an office where
those many tribal librarians,

00:39:21.470 --> 00:39:23.760
I spent two weeks in Alaska

00:39:23.760 --> 00:39:27.400
in villages along the Bering
Sea, which are Eskimo.

00:39:27.400 --> 00:39:31.450
The only way in and out is
by plane, summer you can come

00:39:31.450 --> 00:39:34.870
by barge; I prefer
not to do that.

00:39:34.870 --> 00:39:37.570
Even planes, which you
look down on the ground,

00:39:37.570 --> 00:39:39.730
you see all these planes
crashed down there and,

00:39:39.730 --> 00:39:42.030
"Oh well, okay, not today."

00:39:42.030 --> 00:39:47.010
But they have a great need up
there and fortunately for them,

00:39:47.010 --> 00:39:51.310
the Alaska State Library tries
to provide some services.

00:39:51.310 --> 00:39:58.160
So, I think Dr. Hayden
understands the big picture

00:39:58.160 --> 00:40:01.500
and I'll be there to
help her if she needs me.

00:40:02.930 --> 00:40:04.230
And so will you.

00:40:04.230 --> 00:40:06.790
&gt;&gt; Judith Gray: We will try.

00:40:06.790 --> 00:40:08.090
Yes.

00:40:08.090 --> 00:40:10.500
&gt;&gt; Guha Shankar: So what, so
in your assessment, what is --

00:40:10.500 --> 00:40:13.210
you've mentioned a lot of
different needs, infrastructure,

00:40:13.210 --> 00:40:15.670
and funding maybe
not so much but --

00:40:15.670 --> 00:40:16.970
&gt;&gt; Judith Gray: Training.

00:40:16.970 --> 00:40:18.270
&gt;&gt; Guha Shankar: What is,
yeah, in terms of training,

00:40:18.270 --> 00:40:22.590
what do you see as the next step
for tribal librarians to take?

00:40:22.590 --> 00:40:24.490
&gt;&gt; Dr. Lotsee Patterson: Well,
you know I'm not out there

00:40:24.490 --> 00:40:25.790
in contact with them daily

00:40:25.790 --> 00:40:28.110
but I can tell you
generally what I think.

00:40:28.110 --> 00:40:32.120
They still need basic,
basic skills.

00:40:32.120 --> 00:40:34.730
And, you know, like searching
and reference questions,

00:40:34.730 --> 00:40:38.080
and purchasing quality
materials, all that basic stuff

00:40:38.080 --> 00:40:39.400
that librarians learn.

00:40:39.400 --> 00:40:43.240
But what I hear at this national
conference and what I see

00:40:43.240 --> 00:40:45.730
in talking -- I still
keep my finger you know,

00:40:45.730 --> 00:40:47.400
attached with a number of them.

00:40:47.400 --> 00:40:51.570
Now they want to know, "How
do I digitize my collection?

00:40:51.570 --> 00:40:52.870
How do I start that?

00:40:52.870 --> 00:40:54.170
Where do I go?

00:40:54.170 --> 00:40:55.470
Who can help me?"

00:40:55.470 --> 00:40:59.200
And I would say digitization is
the number-one issue right now,

00:40:59.200 --> 00:41:01.870
even for those that
are advanced.

00:41:01.870 --> 00:41:07.430
They have some materials

00:41:07.430 --> 00:41:11.100
about their own people
they do not want shared.

00:41:11.100 --> 00:41:17.750
So they're very reluctant to do
any kind of permanent, you know,

00:41:17.750 --> 00:41:20.300
even languages; you've
probably faced this.

00:41:20.300 --> 00:41:24.120
There are some tribes that we
do not want our language written

00:41:24.120 --> 00:41:26.520
because it's an oral language

00:41:26.520 --> 00:41:29.300
and it must be transmitted
that way.

00:41:29.300 --> 00:41:32.700
They are so fearful, many of
them are, that if they put it

00:41:32.700 --> 00:41:35.980
in writing or they put
it on a CD or a video,

00:41:35.980 --> 00:41:38.450
somebody will come and take it.

00:41:38.450 --> 00:41:42.770
I can name you many instances
where would-be authors have gone

00:41:42.770 --> 00:41:45.370
to Indian people and asked
them to tell them stories,

00:41:45.370 --> 00:41:48.360
they go away, and they write
that and adapt it and amend it,

00:41:48.360 --> 00:41:49.970
and make it all kinds of,
you know, their own way,

00:41:49.970 --> 00:41:54.280
and publish it as an
official Acoma tale,

00:41:54.280 --> 00:41:56.410
and it sells like crazy.

00:41:56.410 --> 00:41:59.790
New Mexico had several of those.

00:41:59.790 --> 00:42:02.210
So, they, they're leery

00:42:02.210 --> 00:42:06.400
that somebody will take their
oral history, their stories,

00:42:06.400 --> 00:42:11.130
their music, and use it
for commercial purposes.

00:42:11.130 --> 00:42:12.610
So, when they talk

00:42:12.610 --> 00:42:16.560
about digitizing,
that element applies.

00:42:16.560 --> 00:42:19.520
But on the other hand,
and I learned this

00:42:19.520 --> 00:42:22.400
at the Arizona meeting because
we have Hopi and Navajo there,

00:42:22.400 --> 00:42:26.330
were adamant: "We don't
want, you know, we want this

00:42:26.330 --> 00:42:29.350
in our own, we don't
want university archives

00:42:29.350 --> 00:42:30.650
to have this.

00:42:30.650 --> 00:42:34.500
We don't want," well, if
you just wait, let them talk

00:42:34.500 --> 00:42:38.010
and listen, and then
you say, "Okay.

00:42:38.010 --> 00:42:41.020
What will you do with it?"

00:42:41.020 --> 00:42:44.730
"Oh, well, we have this
warehouse you know we could put

00:42:44.730 --> 00:42:46.270
it out there."

00:42:46.270 --> 00:42:48.330
"Is it temperature-controlled?"

00:42:48.330 --> 00:42:52.190
"No." "Is it
humidity-controlled?"

00:42:52.190 --> 00:42:55.770
"No." You just let
them think through it

00:42:55.770 --> 00:42:58.890
and then they decide
maybe it would be okay

00:42:58.890 --> 00:43:00.800
if your library kept it.

00:43:00.800 --> 00:43:06.150
And it would still be ours,
but we can come and use it.

00:43:06.150 --> 00:43:10.150
So, just give them
time and be patient.

00:43:10.150 --> 00:43:12.040
They realize the value.

00:43:12.040 --> 00:43:14.650
You all have heard this
more than I, about languages

00:43:14.650 --> 00:43:17.100
that were lost and they come
to a library in an archive

00:43:17.100 --> 00:43:19.960
and they find, you're
at the top of this,

00:43:19.960 --> 00:43:22.190
recordings of their language.

00:43:22.190 --> 00:43:24.610
They have never heard
those words,

00:43:24.610 --> 00:43:27.160
nobody remembers them anymore.

00:43:27.160 --> 00:43:30.700
So I think more and more
there's a coming together

00:43:30.700 --> 00:43:36.090
and it takes special people
like you two that are sensitive,

00:43:36.090 --> 00:43:42.880
caring, smart, that understand
this to make that happen.

00:43:42.880 --> 00:43:45.050
Where better to keep
this motherload

00:43:45.050 --> 00:43:49.310
of material than here?

00:43:49.310 --> 00:43:51.560
So I'm an advocate for you two.

00:43:51.560 --> 00:43:52.860
&gt;&gt; Guha Shankar: Thank you.

00:43:52.860 --> 00:43:55.160
&gt;&gt; Judith Gray: Thank
you so much.

00:43:57.310 --> 00:43:59.380
&gt;&gt; Guha Shankar: Well, I was
going to ask you something,

00:43:59.380 --> 00:44:01.080
you mentioned something
interesting about,

00:44:01.080 --> 00:44:03.750
your travels have taken
you abroad to meet

00:44:03.750 --> 00:44:05.870
with other Indigenous
communities.

00:44:05.870 --> 00:44:09.080
And generally, where does
the United States stand

00:44:09.080 --> 00:44:12.110
in relationship to the Maori
who, as you said, are advanced?

00:44:12.110 --> 00:44:15.220
I mean, and I'm not using
this in a comparison scale

00:44:15.220 --> 00:44:16.970
but I'm just wondering
what needs to be done.

00:44:16.970 --> 00:44:18.270
&gt;&gt; Dr. Lotsee Patterson: No,
that's extremely important,

00:44:18.270 --> 00:44:20.340
and I, you know I go
home and do some homework

00:44:20.340 --> 00:44:23.600
because I haven't done
this, five or ten years,

00:44:23.600 --> 00:44:26.820
but United Nations is trying
to make a declaration,

00:44:26.820 --> 00:44:30.000
and worked on it with the
IMLS, one of the legal councils

00:44:30.000 --> 00:44:33.220
over there has worked with
them in writing policy

00:44:33.220 --> 00:44:34.860
and drafting a language

00:44:34.860 --> 00:44:38.580
that hopefully will be
universally accepted.

00:44:38.580 --> 00:44:41.170
I actually don't know where
that stands right now,

00:44:41.170 --> 00:44:43.240
but United Nations,

00:44:43.240 --> 00:44:47.710
and I believe there are some
other international group,

00:44:47.710 --> 00:44:50.850
they were pushed, the Maoris
have been very adamant,

00:44:50.850 --> 00:44:54.770
the Australian Aboriginal
people have very adamant

00:44:54.770 --> 00:44:58.030
about these issues,
and protocols

00:44:58.030 --> 00:45:02.000
and ownership, if you will.

00:45:02.000 --> 00:45:04.430
But there are other
countries too.

00:45:04.430 --> 00:45:08.220
So many times they work in
isolation and they need,

00:45:08.220 --> 00:45:12.140
there's great benefit
in joining.

00:45:12.140 --> 00:45:18.920
And I actually have not
researched that for a while,

00:45:18.920 --> 00:45:22.640
but I think the last thing I
heard was that they're going

00:45:22.640 --> 00:45:24.650
to drop that, United Nations,

00:45:24.650 --> 00:45:26.700
that they call it
Declaration of --

00:45:26.700 --> 00:45:28.520
&gt;&gt; Judith Gray: Of the
Rights of Indigenous Peoples.

00:45:28.520 --> 00:45:29.820
&gt;&gt; Dr. Lotsee Patterson:
Yes, yes.

00:45:29.820 --> 00:45:33.420
&gt;&gt; Judith Gray: Yeah, that was
ratified and the US did sign on.

00:45:33.420 --> 00:45:34.850
&gt;&gt; Guha Shankar: Finally.

00:45:34.850 --> 00:45:36.150
&gt;&gt; Dr. Lotsee Patterson:
Aren't they still working

00:45:36.150 --> 00:45:37.450
with some language and things?

00:45:37.450 --> 00:45:40.510
There may be other aspects
of it that they're --

00:45:40.510 --> 00:45:42.360
I'm honestly not up
on that right now.

00:45:42.360 --> 00:45:43.660
&gt;&gt; Judith Gray: Yeah.

00:45:43.660 --> 00:45:44.960
I think there's a
little bit more debate

00:45:44.960 --> 00:45:47.260
in the World Intellectual
Property Organization.

00:45:47.260 --> 00:45:48.560
They're, they're trying --

00:45:48.560 --> 00:45:49.860
&gt;&gt; Dr. Lotsee Patterson:
Yes, yes, yes.

00:45:49.860 --> 00:45:51.160
WIPO? Is it WIPO?

00:45:51.160 --> 00:45:52.460
&gt;&gt; Guha Shankar: WIPO, yeah.

00:45:52.460 --> 00:45:53.760
&gt;&gt; Dr. Lotsee Patterson: Yeah.

00:45:53.760 --> 00:45:55.060
That's right.

00:45:55.060 --> 00:45:56.360
&gt;&gt; Judith Gray: I think that's

00:45:56.360 --> 00:45:57.660
where their issues are
being further discussed.

00:45:57.660 --> 00:45:58.960
&gt;&gt; Dr. Lotsee Patterson:
Because people get very,

00:45:58.960 --> 00:46:00.570
I've met archivists who
just get livid, you know,

00:46:00.570 --> 00:46:05.470
that you don't think this should
be in their archives or, I mean,

00:46:05.470 --> 00:46:08.400
they're very territorial,
archivists are.

00:46:08.400 --> 00:46:09.700
&gt;&gt; Judith Gray: Who, us?

00:46:09.700 --> 00:46:11.000
&gt;&gt; Dr. Lotsee Patterson:

00:46:11.000 --> 00:46:14.330
Librarians are much
more generous.

00:46:14.330 --> 00:46:16.120
Well, I understand.

00:46:16.120 --> 00:46:18.030
You know, I understand
their point of view.

00:46:18.030 --> 00:46:21.900
But we need to get the two sides
together and let the archivists,

00:46:21.900 --> 00:46:24.900
and I'm talking about university
and, you know, that level,

00:46:24.900 --> 00:46:27.520
not at your level,
where they need

00:46:27.520 --> 00:46:30.020
to listen to the Native people.

00:46:30.020 --> 00:46:31.950
They'll come together.

00:46:31.950 --> 00:46:35.460
But it's a matter
of mutual respect.

00:46:35.460 --> 00:46:40.290
You need to respect one another
and your interest and focus,

00:46:40.290 --> 00:46:43.680
foci, I guess it
would be plural.

00:46:43.680 --> 00:46:44.980
That's a good point, though.

00:46:44.980 --> 00:46:46.280
&gt;&gt; Guha Shankar: Thank you.

00:46:46.280 --> 00:46:48.780
I wanted to return to this
notion of basic training

00:46:48.780 --> 00:46:51.090
for librarians, because you
touched upon something I think

00:46:51.090 --> 00:46:54.020
is interesting, you've talked
about a generational shift

00:46:54.020 --> 00:46:56.410
from the older generation
of librarians

00:46:56.410 --> 00:46:58.940
who might have been older, or
community scholars for lack

00:46:58.940 --> 00:47:00.690
of a better word, to people

00:47:00.690 --> 00:47:03.090
who got an accreditation
who are younger.

00:47:03.090 --> 00:47:08.770
But is that generally the case
that all tribal libraries will,

00:47:08.770 --> 00:47:11.470
can afford to have a person --

00:47:11.470 --> 00:47:12.770
&gt;&gt; Dr. Lotsee Patterson:
No, they can't.

00:47:12.770 --> 00:47:14.890
Nor small public
libraries can't.

00:47:14.890 --> 00:47:17.720
No, and that's why you
have to be realistic.

00:47:17.720 --> 00:47:20.280
I'm a realist.

00:47:20.280 --> 00:47:22.550
I realize you're not going
to have MLS people out there.

00:47:22.550 --> 00:47:24.300
Sometimes they do.

00:47:24.300 --> 00:47:27.160
Laguna has a person who
has graduated, has an MLS

00:47:27.160 --> 00:47:30.620
and she came back to
the Laguna community

00:47:30.620 --> 00:47:33.450
because she wanted
to serve her people.

00:47:33.450 --> 00:47:37.710
But sometimes, coming back to
your own community is harder

00:47:37.710 --> 00:47:40.520
than an outside Native person.

00:47:40.520 --> 00:47:43.030
I always compare it to
Jesus of Nazareth; you know,

00:47:43.030 --> 00:47:46.690
he couldn't go home,
if that makes sense.

00:47:46.690 --> 00:47:50.260
So, sometimes it's very hard
because -- I'll tell you why:

00:47:50.260 --> 00:47:52.980
because they're very
critical of their own

00:47:52.980 --> 00:47:56.220
and they will not criticize
an outside person like that.

00:47:56.220 --> 00:47:57.520
I've seen that happen.

00:47:57.520 --> 00:47:58.820
I saw it happen at Cochiti.

00:47:58.820 --> 00:48:02.110
We had a really bright
young girl we trained and,

00:48:02.110 --> 00:48:06.490
but they were, the tribal
leadership would just,

00:48:06.490 --> 00:48:11.200
it's different in each pueblo,
but it's usually the elder men,

00:48:11.200 --> 00:48:15.590
it's always men, who have
reached a certain status

00:48:15.590 --> 00:48:16.900
and they then govern the tribe.

00:48:16.900 --> 00:48:18.680
They have different duties.

00:48:18.680 --> 00:48:23.140
But I've seen them come down on
her, cultural things, you know?

00:48:23.140 --> 00:48:25.290
"You shouldn't do this,
you shouldn't," you know,

00:48:25.290 --> 00:48:26.590
and she was sitting there.

00:48:26.590 --> 00:48:30.540
Well, that's very hard to
take for a bright young girl.

00:48:30.540 --> 00:48:35.690
So it's kind of -- it's a
really good point, though.

00:48:35.690 --> 00:48:38.150
What do you do?

00:48:38.150 --> 00:48:40.040
They won't criticize an --

00:48:40.040 --> 00:48:41.900
even a white person
they won't criticize

00:48:41.900 --> 00:48:44.210
like they will their own.

00:48:44.210 --> 00:48:49.440
And I've heard an older Comanche
woman explain it this way: "Oh,

00:48:49.440 --> 00:48:52.540
honey, don't worry about them.

00:48:52.540 --> 00:48:55.500
They're just white people
and they don't understand."

00:48:55.500 --> 00:48:59.890
But I think that says a lot.

00:48:59.890 --> 00:49:04.350
You know, in other words,
"Don't try to explain to them.

00:49:04.350 --> 00:49:07.450
They're just white people;
they don't understand."

00:49:10.280 --> 00:49:12.080
&gt;&gt; Guha Shankar: So taking
up your, in the present

00:49:12.080 --> 00:49:14.520
in associations with the
American Indian Library

00:49:14.520 --> 00:49:19.220
Association, which you were, you
founded, what is its role today

00:49:19.220 --> 00:49:22.400
in educating and
training Native people?

00:49:22.400 --> 00:49:26.570
&gt;&gt; Dr. Lotsee Patterson:
Well, they say, the bylaws

00:49:26.570 --> 00:49:28.750
and mission, to assist
tribal librarians

00:49:28.750 --> 00:49:31.500
but they really have no
mechanism for doing so,

00:49:31.500 --> 00:49:34.370
because AILA, American
Indian Library Association,

00:49:34.370 --> 00:49:37.410
is just composed of various
people across the country

00:49:37.410 --> 00:49:38.830
who belong to the association.

00:49:38.830 --> 00:49:43.760
We do publish a newsletter
and, but we have no ability

00:49:43.760 --> 00:49:45.280
to provide what they
really need,

00:49:45.280 --> 00:49:48.250
which is one-on-one assistance.

00:49:48.250 --> 00:49:50.180
We don't have that.

00:49:50.180 --> 00:49:53.960
What AILA should be
is leading the charge

00:49:53.960 --> 00:49:57.660
for federal legislation for
amendments to various pieces

00:49:57.660 --> 00:50:00.400
of legislation, the
national visibility.

00:50:00.400 --> 00:50:02.370
That should be their role.

00:50:02.370 --> 00:50:06.480
It's not done very well, I
mean -- well-intended people,

00:50:06.480 --> 00:50:10.610
it's done, you know, but it's
just -- everybody's a volunteer,

00:50:10.610 --> 00:50:14.500
and nobody has time to say,
"Okay, I'll go for six months

00:50:14.500 --> 00:50:17.410
out to Crow Reservation and --
we did have somebody do that,

00:50:17.410 --> 00:50:21.410
by the way, to help
them catalog.

00:50:21.410 --> 00:50:26.980
&gt;&gt; Judith Gray: So, AILA meets
together with ALA, correct?

00:50:26.980 --> 00:50:28.280
&gt;&gt; Dr. Lotsee Patterson: Yes.

00:50:28.280 --> 00:50:31.510
AILA -- the American Indian
Library Association was started

00:50:31.510 --> 00:50:34.660
-- it wasn't called that
then but as a subcommittee

00:50:34.660 --> 00:50:38.880
to an ALA committee, they would
call it, it's called OLOS now,

00:50:38.880 --> 00:50:42.080
Office of Library
Outreach Services.

00:50:42.080 --> 00:50:46.150
We started as a committee, a
subcommittee of a committee.

00:50:46.150 --> 00:50:51.440
ALA is very bureaucratic,
and later we got to a point

00:50:51.440 --> 00:50:55.160
where we could say we're going
to form our own association.

00:50:55.160 --> 00:50:58.730
We had no funding base, we had
no, you know, so you understand,

00:50:58.730 --> 00:51:05.720
it has to just be volunteers and
-- but there really is a role,

00:51:05.720 --> 00:51:10.120
and they will celebrate their
40th anniversary next spring,

00:51:10.120 --> 00:51:12.230
I mean, next ALA
midwinter, I think,

00:51:12.230 --> 00:51:16.150
here in D.C. They have
had a role, but in terms

00:51:16.150 --> 00:51:23.550
of doing on-site assistance,
they just can't do it.

00:51:23.550 --> 00:51:28.350
But everything is good, you
know, I mean, there is --

00:51:28.350 --> 00:51:32.250
you need associations,
you need groups

00:51:32.250 --> 00:51:35.210
that can speak as one voice.

00:51:35.210 --> 00:51:38.680
I've seen the power, as you
know, being in Washington,

00:51:38.680 --> 00:51:40.510
there's power in numbers.

00:51:40.510 --> 00:51:43.380
And I don't know what
the membership is now,

00:51:43.380 --> 00:51:46.650
but a few hundred.

00:51:46.650 --> 00:51:49.460
But we have many friends;
there are many people

00:51:49.460 --> 00:51:53.180
that would help us if we ask.

00:51:53.180 --> 00:51:58.300
&gt;&gt; Judith Gray: So probably
ATALM -- the Association, again,

00:51:58.300 --> 00:52:00.810
for Tribal Archives
Libraries and Museums --

00:52:00.810 --> 00:52:04.530
is that more fulfilling
the needs for training

00:52:04.530 --> 00:52:05.950
at this point, do you think?

00:52:05.950 --> 00:52:07.340
&gt;&gt; Dr. Lotsee Patterson:
It's a great conference

00:52:07.340 --> 00:52:09.640
and a great organization,
but it has one purpose,

00:52:09.640 --> 00:52:12.840
and that is that meeting,
an annual conference.

00:52:12.840 --> 00:52:16.810
But IMLS partnered -- well,
that's funded by IMLS,

00:52:16.810 --> 00:52:19.800
but IMLS then said to
the tribal libraries,

00:52:19.800 --> 00:52:22.920
"Here's your basic grant,
$5000, but then you can ask

00:52:22.920 --> 00:52:26.980
for another 2000, so you
can go to that conference.

00:52:26.980 --> 00:52:28.620
That's enabled the people --

00:52:28.620 --> 00:52:31.100
because they have no
money to travel --

00:52:31.100 --> 00:52:35.290
enabled those people in
those little places to come

00:52:35.290 --> 00:52:39.120
to that conference and network
with others in the same shape,

00:52:39.120 --> 00:52:41.610
and that's invaluable.

00:52:41.610 --> 00:52:43.990
Very, very valuable.

00:52:43.990 --> 00:52:47.410
And the nice thing there is
they get to meet the people

00:52:47.410 --> 00:52:52.350
from Washington who
are the power brokers.

00:52:52.350 --> 00:52:56.050
&gt;&gt; Guha Shankar: But I
think you're being generous

00:52:56.050 --> 00:52:57.810
on the one hand to
ATALM and IMLS,

00:52:57.810 --> 00:53:01.060
but you're also pointing out,
it seems to me, a lack or a gap

00:53:01.060 --> 00:53:03.990
in terms of sustaining
that knowledgebase,

00:53:03.990 --> 00:53:07.070
because ATALM meets once
a year, but then the rest

00:53:07.070 --> 00:53:08.880
of the year what happens
in between meetings?

00:53:08.880 --> 00:53:10.180
I mean, it seems to me
that there's something --

00:53:10.180 --> 00:53:11.480
&gt;&gt; Dr. Lotsee Patterson: Well,

00:53:11.480 --> 00:53:13.290
unless they've encountered
somebody and interfaced

00:53:13.290 --> 00:53:15.890
with them at the conference,
exchanged information,

00:53:15.890 --> 00:53:19.130
got their emails,
probably not much.

00:53:19.130 --> 00:53:22.450
But there's value in that, and I
think a number of them do that.

00:53:22.450 --> 00:53:24.780
You've probably been
approached that way.

00:53:24.780 --> 00:53:26.080
&gt;&gt; Judith Gray: Yeah.

00:53:26.080 --> 00:53:27.380
&gt;&gt; Dr. Lotsee Patterson:
You know, once they know you

00:53:27.380 --> 00:53:28.680
and they know they
can call you --

00:53:28.680 --> 00:53:30.400
that happens on a
one-on-one basis,

00:53:30.400 --> 00:53:32.780
and I expect a good
bit of that happens.

00:53:32.780 --> 00:53:34.080
&gt;&gt; Guha Shankar: It does.

00:53:34.080 --> 00:53:36.130
&gt;&gt; Dr. Lotsee Patterson:
More than I know.

00:53:36.130 --> 00:53:38.610
The nice thing about
that conference is,

00:53:38.610 --> 00:53:41.230
they pull in people
like yourselves,

00:53:41.230 --> 00:53:45.180
people from various
government offices,

00:53:45.180 --> 00:53:50.050
who are really unapproachable
to them out in those little --

00:53:50.050 --> 00:53:54.020
Rough Rock, Arizona,
until they've met them

00:53:54.020 --> 00:53:56.210
and they know they
can talk to them.

00:53:56.210 --> 00:54:01.050
There are many -- I'm trying
to think of some that were --

00:54:01.050 --> 00:54:04.350
I call them fringe,
like Parks Service.

00:54:04.350 --> 00:54:09.490
There are many different federal
agencies that could have a role.

00:54:09.490 --> 00:54:14.870
That's what I see LC
doing: having some element

00:54:14.870 --> 00:54:19.580
from the various and many
departments, divisions,

00:54:19.580 --> 00:54:22.650
I can see where -- even
the law library, you know,

00:54:22.650 --> 00:54:27.300
has an indigenous law library
-- well that's invaluable,

00:54:27.300 --> 00:54:33.680
because tribal people need the
law, and that's like them saying

00:54:33.680 --> 00:54:35.800
to me, "We don't want to have
to go to the state and say,

00:54:35.800 --> 00:54:38.270
"What does the state
statute say?"

00:54:38.270 --> 00:54:40.990
We want to look it
up ourselves."

00:54:40.990 --> 00:54:45.690
So this indigenous law
library component here --

00:54:45.690 --> 00:54:50.220
I haven't explored it, so I
don't know much about it but --

00:54:50.220 --> 00:54:52.560
and I don't know if anybody
from that office has come

00:54:52.560 --> 00:54:53.970
to the ATALM meetings.

00:54:53.970 --> 00:54:55.270
Have they?

00:54:55.270 --> 00:54:56.570
&gt;&gt; Guha Shankar: Yes.

00:54:56.570 --> 00:54:57.870
&gt;&gt; Dr. Lotsee Patterson:
Good, good, okay.

00:54:57.870 --> 00:54:59.170
&gt;&gt; Guha Shankar: Yeah.

00:54:59.170 --> 00:55:00.470
&gt;&gt; Dr. Lotsee Patterson: I am
so busy when I go to ATALM,

00:55:00.470 --> 00:55:02.060
seeing people, and
renewing acquaintances

00:55:02.060 --> 00:55:05.240
that I miss a lot
of the meetings.

00:55:05.240 --> 00:55:08.760
But I'm out there, they all
know I'm there, you know?

00:55:08.760 --> 00:55:12.330
I still get calls from
people wanting help

00:55:12.330 --> 00:55:15.610
and I've also had calls,
like, from a mother

00:55:15.610 --> 00:55:19.710
in Vermont whose sixth-grade
child has a report due on,

00:55:19.710 --> 00:55:23.430
quote, "Indians" and could I
please sell them everything I

00:55:23.430 --> 00:55:26.930
have on, quote, "Indians."

00:55:26.930 --> 00:55:32.270
I'm usually patient with
them, but this time I wasn't.

00:55:32.270 --> 00:55:36.130
I usually say, "Go to your
local public library."

00:55:36.130 --> 00:55:39.650
And her response was,
"I don't have time."

00:55:39.650 --> 00:55:43.150
So, I said, "Well what
makes you think I do?"

00:55:43.150 --> 00:55:46.470
And I heard later
that I made her sick

00:55:46.470 --> 00:55:49.870
and she had to go to the doctor.

00:55:49.870 --> 00:55:56.230
So, you never know what
you're going to do or not do.

00:55:56.230 --> 00:55:58.940
&gt;&gt; Guha Shankar: So I want
to ask you, circling back

00:55:58.940 --> 00:56:00.380
to another point
you made earlier,

00:56:00.380 --> 00:56:02.650
you talked about
New Mexico obviously

00:56:02.650 --> 00:56:05.460
where you established the
tribal libraries forum

00:56:05.460 --> 00:56:09.590
or the association -- that's
a shining moment it seems

00:56:09.590 --> 00:56:11.520
to me in terms of success.

00:56:11.520 --> 00:56:15.220
How have those, sort
of, relationships

00:56:15.220 --> 00:56:17.010
and those foundations
you built --

00:56:17.010 --> 00:56:19.720
how are they going on
today in New Mexico?

00:56:19.720 --> 00:56:22.890
Are they continuing in terms
of training and librarianship?

00:56:22.890 --> 00:56:24.620
&gt;&gt; Dr. Lotsee Patterson:
Yes, and in New Mexico,

00:56:24.620 --> 00:56:26.990
because we worked a lot
with the state library,

00:56:26.990 --> 00:56:30.450
every time we got a new state
librarian, which was frequently,

00:56:30.450 --> 00:56:33.300
I would call them and
say, "Let me take you out

00:56:33.300 --> 00:56:35.240
and show you the
tribal libraries."

00:56:35.240 --> 00:56:38.520
So you have to work at it.

00:56:38.520 --> 00:56:41.870
And they, and then,
after I left,

00:56:41.870 --> 00:56:44.360
one of the people I had
hired to do training

00:56:44.360 --> 00:56:46.480
for me became -- guess what?

00:56:46.480 --> 00:56:48.490
The state librarian.

00:56:48.490 --> 00:56:52.170
So -- and Ben Wakashige
you've probably met.

00:56:52.170 --> 00:56:57.870
They actually worked --
and Ben is a genius --

00:56:57.870 --> 00:57:02.370
they got some state legislation,
we had a Navajo legislator --

00:57:02.370 --> 00:57:06.880
that helps -- whose sister
was a librarian -- that helps.

00:57:06.880 --> 00:57:10.560
But he introduced legislation
in the New Mexico legislature

00:57:10.560 --> 00:57:14.030
to provide state funds
for tribal libraries.

00:57:14.030 --> 00:57:16.180
That's as far as -- I
think New York did that,

00:57:16.180 --> 00:57:19.310
Joe Schubert many years ago
did that in New York State.

00:57:19.310 --> 00:57:23.050
But that was kind of a first;
most states won't do that,

00:57:23.050 --> 00:57:26.400
where they allocated some
money for the tribal libraries.

00:57:26.400 --> 00:57:28.900
But the thing is, in
those communities,

00:57:28.900 --> 00:57:31.760
if they're white people, anybody
can come use the tribal library.

00:57:31.760 --> 00:57:33.330
It's not just for Indians.

00:57:33.330 --> 00:57:36.550
So it really is a
community library.

00:57:40.920 --> 00:57:43.450
&gt;&gt; Guha Shankar: I was
curious, I mean, there's a point

00:57:43.450 --> 00:57:45.860
that was made I think maybe
by one of your associates

00:57:45.860 --> 00:57:50.360
that libraries, because they are
part of the education system,

00:57:50.360 --> 00:57:53.600
are actually a sovereign
right, or a treaty right?

00:57:53.600 --> 00:57:55.170
Can you expand a little --

00:57:55.170 --> 00:57:58.510
&gt;&gt; Dr. Lotsee Patterson: Well,
by treaty, with most tribes,

00:57:58.510 --> 00:58:02.670
the federal government promised
the Indians, if they give

00:58:02.670 --> 00:58:05.340
up all their land and move,

00:58:05.340 --> 00:58:09.590
that the federal government
would provide them with health,

00:58:09.590 --> 00:58:11.710
education and welfare.

00:58:11.710 --> 00:58:13.840
Those three big things.

00:58:13.840 --> 00:58:17.440
Well, you can fit libraries in
two of those and maybe three.

00:58:17.440 --> 00:58:22.240
So they were what we call
"treaty obligations," and we use

00:58:22.240 --> 00:58:26.840
that as saying, "You promised
that you would provide" --

00:58:26.840 --> 00:58:30.400
and the schools are obvious.

00:58:30.400 --> 00:58:35.160
Welfare's a broader term, but
I fit libraries into that.

00:58:35.160 --> 00:58:38.320
And even health, because
NIH approached me once,

00:58:38.320 --> 00:58:41.300
and "What can we do to work
with tribal libraries?"

00:58:41.300 --> 00:58:43.710
They want to, they
want to do it.

00:58:43.710 --> 00:58:46.280
But because tribes
do have a status

00:58:46.280 --> 00:58:50.170
as being sovereign
nations within a nation,

00:58:50.170 --> 00:58:53.160
they are -- they're sovereign.

00:58:53.160 --> 00:58:56.130
Only thing on a reservation,
I've tried to explain

00:58:56.130 --> 00:58:58.870
to some tourists -- when
you're on a reservation,

00:58:58.870 --> 00:59:00.510
state laws do not apply.

00:59:00.510 --> 00:59:03.180
Don't call the sheriff;
they can't help you

00:59:03.180 --> 00:59:04.960
if you get in trouble.

00:59:04.960 --> 00:59:06.260
You're on your own.

00:59:06.260 --> 00:59:07.720
Tribal law applies.

00:59:07.720 --> 00:59:14.180
The only thing that precedes
tribal law is federal law.

00:59:14.180 --> 00:59:17.650
So, you know, I used to think,
when I crossed that line going

00:59:17.650 --> 00:59:19.910
into a reservation, I even
took my sunglasses off

00:59:19.910 --> 00:59:22.000
because I didn't want
to look like a tourist.

00:59:22.000 --> 00:59:24.810
Hide your camera, get
rid of your camera.

00:59:24.810 --> 00:59:29.440
You are their guest, and that's
the way I always looked at it.

00:59:29.440 --> 00:59:33.670
I'm afraid that is not an
attitude some people understand,

00:59:33.670 --> 00:59:39.400
but they -- that relationship
of federal responsibility

00:59:39.400 --> 00:59:43.180
to sovereign nations within
a nation is very complicated.

00:59:43.180 --> 00:59:45.940
That's why we have
high-paid tribal lawyers

00:59:45.940 --> 00:59:51.950
and there are law firms here in
D.C. that only do tribal law.

00:59:51.950 --> 00:59:57.720
But it's complicated, and
that's why the states, though,

00:59:57.720 --> 01:00:00.460
state libraries can say, "Hey,

01:00:00.460 --> 01:00:02.090
they're a federal
responsibility.

01:00:02.090 --> 01:00:04.330
We don't owe them a thing.

01:00:04.330 --> 01:00:08.340
We do not put state
money onto reservations,

01:00:08.340 --> 01:00:10.380
even if it's training."

01:00:10.380 --> 01:00:13.700
Now, that's less and
less true, I think.

01:00:13.700 --> 01:00:18.350
Arizona has done things,
New Mexico, but some states

01:00:18.350 --> 01:00:22.230
where there's a large Indian
population still feel that way.

01:00:22.230 --> 01:00:24.900
&gt;&gt; Judith Gray: Including
Oklahoma?

01:00:24.900 --> 01:00:26.200
&gt;&gt; Dr. Lotsee Patterson:
Oklahoma --

01:00:26.200 --> 01:00:28.960
here's their response, the state
librarian: "Well, they can come

01:00:28.960 --> 01:00:32.980
to us and we'll help them."

01:00:32.980 --> 01:00:37.850
Okay. They do training workshops
for their public librarians,

01:00:37.850 --> 01:00:40.040
you know, the basic stuff.

01:00:40.040 --> 01:00:41.940
"They can come to those."

01:00:41.940 --> 01:00:43.840
Well, the little
tribal libraries are a

01:00:43.840 --> 01:00:45.910
one-person library.

01:00:45.910 --> 01:00:49.190
They can't take off, and if they
could, they don't have the money

01:00:49.190 --> 01:00:51.870
to drive 200 miles
to Oklahoma City

01:00:51.870 --> 01:00:53.170
and spend a night in a hotel.

01:00:53.170 --> 01:00:54.850
They just can't do it.

01:00:54.850 --> 01:00:58.060
So we have a mix, you
know, a mix and match.

01:00:58.060 --> 01:01:01.780
Sometimes they will go to
those training sessions.

01:01:01.780 --> 01:01:04.080
I would say in Oklahoma
they try to do,

01:01:04.080 --> 01:01:06.510
the state library,
what they can.

01:01:06.510 --> 01:01:10.230
But they will argue, "We
have to use state money,

01:01:10.230 --> 01:01:12.780
you know, in a certain way.

01:01:12.780 --> 01:01:15.320
The federal government
should do that."

01:01:15.320 --> 01:01:18.610
It varies with the
state librarian,

01:01:18.610 --> 01:01:22.600
who's the state librarian,
what their attitude is.

01:01:22.600 --> 01:01:24.510
&gt;&gt; Judith Gray: And at
the university itself

01:01:24.510 --> 01:01:28.000
in the library school, how much

01:01:28.000 --> 01:01:32.180
of the training there does
end up for tribal people?

01:01:32.180 --> 01:01:34.510
&gt;&gt; Dr. Lotsee Patterson: None.

01:01:34.510 --> 01:01:36.780
&gt;&gt; Judith Gray: So all the
time you were teaching there,

01:01:36.780 --> 01:01:38.080
it was --

01:01:38.080 --> 01:01:39.380
&gt;&gt; Dr. Lotsee Patterson:
Well, think about it.

01:01:39.380 --> 01:01:44.120
Universities, you know, are --
it's a graduate school program,

01:01:44.120 --> 01:01:46.650
professors are all under the
gun to write and publish,

01:01:46.650 --> 01:01:50.970
and to do something with tribal
libraries is taking their

01:01:50.970 --> 01:01:52.630
own time.

01:01:52.630 --> 01:01:54.290
It's something they could do,

01:01:54.290 --> 01:01:58.860
and I would say they
really don't.

01:01:58.860 --> 01:02:02.130
They might come to a
meeting now and then.

01:02:02.130 --> 01:02:05.430
It's not that they don't support
them; it's just that they are

01:02:05.430 --> 01:02:10.220
under the gun, fulfill
their role

01:02:10.220 --> 01:02:14.180
as a researcher and a publisher.

01:02:14.180 --> 01:02:17.460
And as I was told, if
they focused on Indians,

01:02:17.460 --> 01:02:18.910
that's not going to
get them anywhere

01:02:18.910 --> 01:02:24.430
in their tenure track,
generally speaking.

01:02:24.430 --> 01:02:26.170
&gt;&gt; Judith Gray: Of
course, it did for you.

01:02:26.170 --> 01:02:27.930
&gt;&gt; Dr. Lotsee Patterson:
Well, you know,

01:02:27.930 --> 01:02:30.380
you have to be really
stubborn, like I was,

01:02:30.380 --> 01:02:32.690
[inaudible] say I'm
going to do it anyway.

01:02:32.690 --> 01:02:36.460
But we do have -- the other
element I've sort of tried

01:02:36.460 --> 01:02:39.440
to work on, is getting
Indian professors,

01:02:39.440 --> 01:02:42.360
and we do have a few.

01:02:42.360 --> 01:02:46.460
But we need more.

01:02:46.460 --> 01:02:47.760
&gt;&gt; Guha Shankar:
You know, Lotsee,

01:02:47.760 --> 01:02:50.100
you just mentioned something
about the fact that education

01:02:50.100 --> 01:02:53.430
and that was part of the treaty,
you know, sort of obligation,

01:02:53.430 --> 01:02:57.560
and I'm reminded that the
Esther Martinez language act

01:02:57.560 --> 01:03:00.720
for Native Americans is
run through the Department

01:03:00.720 --> 01:03:02.020
of Health and Human Services.

01:03:02.020 --> 01:03:03.320
&gt;&gt; Dr. Lotsee Patterson:
Yeah, that's right.

01:03:03.320 --> 01:03:04.620
&gt;&gt; Guha Shankar: So
that's really interesting,

01:03:04.620 --> 01:03:06.490
just sort of supporting your
point, that health, education

01:03:06.490 --> 01:03:09.570
and welfare in terms of
education cuts across a lot

01:03:09.570 --> 01:03:12.290
of different federal agencies.

01:03:12.290 --> 01:03:13.590
&gt;&gt; Dr. Lotsee Patterson: Yes,

01:03:13.590 --> 01:03:15.780
and I think another valuable
thing for tribal libraries is

01:03:15.780 --> 01:03:17.280
to know about those things.

01:03:17.280 --> 01:03:20.770
I don't know how -- that's ANA
you're talking about, yeah.

01:03:20.770 --> 01:03:25.530
There are, you know, among
your big federal agencies,

01:03:25.530 --> 01:03:29.070
components that will work with
Indians, but who knows about it?

01:03:29.070 --> 01:03:30.700
You know, how do
you know about it

01:03:30.700 --> 01:03:33.000
and how do you know
to access that?

01:03:33.000 --> 01:03:34.640
You know, I'll go
begging on the streets

01:03:34.640 --> 01:03:37.370
if I think I can
find some money.

01:03:37.370 --> 01:03:42.590
Or, not just money, but
it's more assistance,

01:03:42.590 --> 01:03:46.130
because I think money
is ephemeral,

01:03:46.130 --> 01:03:50.870
and you need the
people connection.

01:03:50.870 --> 01:03:55.480
And I've always said, you
can start a library anywhere

01:03:55.480 --> 01:03:57.500
and watch it grow.

01:03:57.500 --> 01:04:03.680
I've started them anywhere,
and I get really, really tired

01:04:03.680 --> 01:04:06.560
of people who say, "Oh, we
don't have money for that."

01:04:06.560 --> 01:04:09.610
Stop it! Just go do it!

01:04:09.610 --> 01:04:11.520
Just do it!

01:04:11.520 --> 01:04:12.820
&gt;&gt; Judith Gray: Sounds like --

01:04:12.820 --> 01:04:14.120
&gt;&gt; Guha Shankar: Yeah.

01:04:14.120 --> 01:04:15.420
So what are your
present projects?

01:04:15.420 --> 01:04:17.950
What are you working on that's
sort of right on the top

01:04:17.950 --> 01:04:19.520
of your -- besides
the homework you have

01:04:19.520 --> 01:04:20.820
to do for the librarian?

01:04:20.820 --> 01:04:22.120
&gt;&gt; Dr. Lotsee Patterson: Yeah.

01:04:22.120 --> 01:04:24.410
&gt;&gt; Guha Shankar: What else
are you most involved with?

01:04:24.410 --> 01:04:26.600
&gt;&gt; Dr. Lotsee Patterson: Well,
I'm involved as an advisor

01:04:26.600 --> 01:04:29.940
on this Oklahoma project
with Sam Noble Museum.

01:04:29.940 --> 01:04:31.720
I'm not doing much advising

01:04:31.720 --> 01:04:34.500
because they know what they're
doing, so they don't need me.

01:04:34.500 --> 01:04:37.280
But I'm cheerleading.

01:04:38.440 --> 01:04:41.540
You know, I think now
I have more opportunity

01:04:41.540 --> 01:04:43.310
to one-on-one with people.

01:04:43.310 --> 01:04:47.220
I still get calls
occasionally from people

01:04:47.220 --> 01:04:50.300
and I appreciate their
effort and I never,

01:04:50.300 --> 01:04:52.100
never am impatient
with the Indian.

01:04:52.100 --> 01:04:57.060
I am sometimes impatient with
mothers of sixth-graders, but --

01:04:57.060 --> 01:05:01.670
just the level of
stupidity, I'm sorry --

01:05:01.670 --> 01:05:03.020
there's no other way to say it.

01:05:03.020 --> 01:05:05.930
You know, first of all to say,

01:05:05.930 --> 01:05:07.810
"We need everything you
have about Indians."

01:05:07.810 --> 01:05:09.300
Go to the Library of Congress

01:05:09.300 --> 01:05:11.600
and see how many
floors it covers.

01:05:13.280 --> 01:05:20.180
The other thing I guess I would
say all of us should do is try

01:05:20.180 --> 01:05:23.850
to promote good writing, you
know, people who write --

01:05:23.850 --> 01:05:25.920
I don't care if it's
non-fiction or fiction.

01:05:25.920 --> 01:05:28.680
We need people who write
from a perspective --

01:05:28.680 --> 01:05:31.090
from the right perspective.

01:05:31.090 --> 01:05:32.800
And it doesn't have
to be Indian,

01:05:32.800 --> 01:05:36.930
but it has to be somebody who
understands and appreciates.

01:05:36.930 --> 01:05:41.600
We need more and more people
telling their own story,

01:05:41.600 --> 01:05:43.530
the Native people.

01:05:43.530 --> 01:05:47.130
I've worked on that for years,
too, trying to encourage,

01:05:47.130 --> 01:05:50.720
without much success,
I must say.

01:05:50.720 --> 01:05:56.670
I've had book publisher,
editors, offer to help.

01:05:56.670 --> 01:05:58.870
"Tell me someone,
I'll work with them."

01:05:58.870 --> 01:06:03.460
And I've tried, but it
really doesn't take root.

01:06:03.460 --> 01:06:08.440
There are very few authors that
can write a good fiction book

01:06:08.440 --> 01:06:12.430
and there are people
who write non-fiction,

01:06:12.430 --> 01:06:14.610
which I say it has
enough fiction in it

01:06:14.610 --> 01:06:17.550
to satisfy my need for fiction.

01:06:17.550 --> 01:06:21.730
&gt;&gt; Guha Shankar: So you're
working on a memoir then?

01:06:21.730 --> 01:06:23.030
&gt;&gt; Dr. Lotsee Patterson: Huh?

01:06:23.030 --> 01:06:24.330
&gt;&gt; Guha Shankar: Are
you working on a memoir?

01:06:24.330 --> 01:06:25.630
&gt;&gt; Dr. Lotsee Patterson: No,
but I have written my obituary.

01:06:25.630 --> 01:06:27.420
Would you like to have a copy?

01:06:27.420 --> 01:06:29.910
[ Laughter ]

01:06:29.910 --> 01:06:32.630
&gt;&gt; Judith Gray: Only later.

01:06:32.630 --> 01:06:35.990
&gt;&gt; Dr. Lotsee Patterson: I plan
ahead, you know, I plan ahead.

01:06:35.990 --> 01:06:38.570
Well, at 86 you need to!

01:06:38.570 --> 01:06:43.650
And I will encounter
somebody once in a while

01:06:43.650 --> 01:06:48.690
that I think might be interested
and I link them with editors.

01:06:48.690 --> 01:06:53.190
Publishers are really, really --
I haven't done so much lately,

01:06:53.190 --> 01:06:58.660
but they want to find
people who can do that.

01:06:58.660 --> 01:07:00.070
Some of you all help
me with that.

01:07:00.070 --> 01:07:03.090
You must meet people
that can do that.

01:07:03.090 --> 01:07:04.390
&gt;&gt; Guha Shankar: Yes, sure.

01:07:04.390 --> 01:07:06.570
We'll give you some names.

01:07:06.570 --> 01:07:10.140
Well, we're going to come to
the end of our time with you

01:07:10.140 --> 01:07:14.230
and we wanted to thank you,
and I guess the final, sort of,

01:07:14.230 --> 01:07:17.950
question is, is there something
that we should have asked

01:07:17.950 --> 01:07:19.250
or that you'd like to share

01:07:19.250 --> 01:07:22.780
with us before we bring
this interview to a close?

01:07:22.780 --> 01:07:24.080
What's on your mind, I mean?

01:07:24.080 --> 01:07:25.380
&gt;&gt; Dr. Lotsee Patterson:
I think I've told you more

01:07:25.380 --> 01:07:26.680
than you wanted to know!

01:07:26.680 --> 01:07:27.980
&gt;&gt; Guha Shankar: No.

01:07:27.980 --> 01:07:29.280
&gt;&gt; Judith Gray: No, no.

01:07:29.280 --> 01:07:30.580
&gt;&gt; Dr. Lotsee Patterson:
So, that's a good question.

01:07:30.580 --> 01:07:33.900
I hadn't thought about that.

01:07:33.900 --> 01:07:40.330
I guess I would just implore you
in your positions of influence

01:07:40.330 --> 01:07:46.190
and expertise to do everything
you can, no matter how small,

01:07:46.190 --> 01:07:49.630
to move things forward.

01:07:49.630 --> 01:07:56.040
Also and backward, you know, the
preservation and conservation,

01:07:56.040 --> 01:08:01.070
as well as looking
ahead, because the ahead

01:08:01.070 --> 01:08:03.730
and the future -- you know,

01:08:03.730 --> 01:08:06.310
so many people think
Indians are, like, gone.

01:08:06.310 --> 01:08:10.830
No. I've taken people, you know,
want to go to Indian country,

01:08:10.830 --> 01:08:12.200
"Well, where are the Indians?"

01:08:12.200 --> 01:08:14.960
"Well you've just been
passing them on the sidewalk,

01:08:14.960 --> 01:08:16.540
you didn't know that?"

01:08:16.540 --> 01:08:19.550
You know, so education --

01:08:19.550 --> 01:08:23.460
you're in a position to educate
both the Indian and non-Indian,

01:08:23.460 --> 01:08:27.300
or indigenous, I guess.

01:08:27.300 --> 01:08:30.870
So keep up the good
work, keep up the fight.

01:08:30.870 --> 01:08:32.700
&gt;&gt; Guha Shankar: Great, okay.

01:08:32.700 --> 01:08:35.180
&gt;&gt; Dr. Lotsee Patterson: I'm
preaching to the choir I know.

01:08:35.180 --> 01:08:37.050
&gt;&gt; Guha Shankar: It's always
good to get reinforcement

01:08:37.050 --> 01:08:38.350
for our work, so
thank you for that.

01:08:38.350 --> 01:08:39.650
&gt;&gt; Dr. Lotsee Patterson: Well,

01:08:39.650 --> 01:08:40.950
and know that someone
appreciates it.

01:08:40.950 --> 01:08:43.400
You may think day to day
nobody cares but we do.

01:08:43.400 --> 01:08:44.700
We do.

01:08:44.700 --> 01:08:46.000
&gt;&gt; Guha Shankar: Thank you.

01:08:46.000 --> 01:08:47.300
&gt;&gt; Judith Gray: Thank you.

01:08:47.300 --> 01:08:48.600
&gt;&gt; Dr. Lotsee Patterson:
And no matter how little,

01:08:48.600 --> 01:08:51.410
it can be significant.

01:08:51.410 --> 01:08:53.260
You never know you've
touched someone,

01:08:53.260 --> 01:08:58.810
or just a very innocuous little
sentence leads to bigger things.

01:08:58.810 --> 01:09:01.280
So do it. Just do it!

01:09:01.280 --> 01:09:02.580
&gt;&gt; Judith Gray: Thank
you, Lotsee.

01:09:02.580 --> 01:09:04.660
&gt;&gt; Guha Shankar: That'll be the
last word from our guest today,

01:09:04.660 --> 01:09:07.850
Dr. Lotsee Patterson, and we
thank you so much for your time.

01:09:07.850 --> 01:09:09.150
&gt;&gt; Dr. Lotsee Patterson:
Thank you.

01:09:09.150 --> 01:09:10.450
&gt;&gt; Guha Shankar: We have had
an interview with you here

01:09:10.450 --> 01:09:13.790
at the Library of Congress
studio on December 20th.

01:09:13.790 --> 01:09:15.730
Looking forward to having
more time with you --

01:09:15.730 --> 01:09:18.410
&gt;&gt; Dr. Lotsee Patterson: Might
give the year, December 20th --

01:09:18.410 --> 01:09:20.240
&gt;&gt; Guha Shankar: 2017.

01:09:20.240 --> 01:09:21.920
You're correct, thank
you so much.

01:09:21.920 --> 01:09:23.220
&gt;&gt; Dr. Lotsee Patterson: Okay.

01:09:23.220 --> 01:09:24.520
&gt;&gt; Guha Shankar: We're
still being educated

01:09:24.520 --> 01:09:25.820
by [inaudible] doctor.

01:09:25.820 --> 01:09:27.120
Thank you.

01:09:27.120 --> 01:09:28.420
We really appreciate your time.

01:09:28.420 --> 01:09:29.720
&gt;&gt; Dr. Lotsee Patterson:
Thank you.

01:09:29.720 --> 01:09:31.020
Thank you for the opportunity.

01:09:31.020 --> 01:09:34.280
&gt;&gt; This has been a presentation
of the Library of Congress.
