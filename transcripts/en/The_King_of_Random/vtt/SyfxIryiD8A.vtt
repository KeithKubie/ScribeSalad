00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:04.980
These ninja balls are customizable, mashable,
and perfect for juggling. The best part is

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:08.780
you can make them at home for practically
nothing. In this project we’re turning some

00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:13.500
flour and a bag of party balloons, into a
colorful batch of superhero stress balls.

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:25.160
All we need to start this project is a variety
of latex party balloons, and a container like

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:28.949
a juice bottle. This one has a wide mouth,
and you’ll see why that’s better in just

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:33.090
a minute. Now, if we cut a common water bottle
in half, it’ll turn upside down and form

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:36.580
a makeshift funnel. We can use this to start
filling our juice bottle with flour, and we’re

00:00:36.580 --> 00:00:41.190
going to need about 3/4 of a cup. You can
see that shaking the funnel up and down rapidly,

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:44.410
transfers the flour into the juice bottle.
And now the next step, is to get it inside

00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:48.610
a balloon. We need to find 3 balloons that
are all the same color, and for this first

00:00:48.610 --> 00:00:52.220
one, I’m going to choose yellow. Now to
get the flour inside, simply blow a balloon

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:56.760
and twist the neck around 4-5 times so the
air is trapped inside. Stretch the mouth of

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:00.400
the ballon over top of the juice bottle, and
when it’s on securely, just let the balloon

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:04.390
go. If you turn the bottle upside down and
squeeze it repeatedly, you can see the flour

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:08.869
transfers easily, without making any mess.
Alright, let’s pinch the neck of the balloon

00:01:08.869 --> 00:01:12.049
and pull it off the bottle, so we can let
the air out, but it will be important to pinch

00:01:12.049 --> 00:01:16.569
it off again before it starts spewing out
flour dust. We still need to get as much air

00:01:16.569 --> 00:01:20.240
out of the balloon as we can, and massaging
the base will help compress the flour and

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:24.219
move any trapped gasses to the top. At this
point you should be able to let go, and the

00:01:24.219 --> 00:01:28.289
flour will stay neatly inside the balloon.
Ok, to get ready for the next step let’s

00:01:28.289 --> 00:01:32.069
carefully clean the outside of the balloon
with a damp cloth, then slowly and carefully

00:01:32.069 --> 00:01:35.920
use a pair of scissors to cut the excess off
the top. While that’s settling down, it’s

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:39.740
a good time to prepare the other balloons
by cutting the ends off them as well. When

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:42.789
you pull them open, you should be able to
get all your fingers inside, and if you stretch

00:01:42.789 --> 00:01:46.649
them open wide enough to place the center
over the flour ball, then wrap it around to

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:50.829
the underside, it’ll seal the flour inside,
and hold everything together firmly. You can

00:01:50.829 --> 00:01:55.060
remove any little ripples by pulling the edges
until it looks nice and smooth. Now if you

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:58.889
want to make sure this never comes apart,
one option is to use a few dabs of super glue

00:01:58.889 --> 00:02:02.590
on the underside of the lip. The glue bonds
really well to rubber, and will help prevent

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:06.659
the balloons from pulling apart. Now we can
also increase the durability by adding a couple

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:10.959
more balloons. This makes it exponentially
stronger, and depending on how firm you want

00:02:10.959 --> 00:02:15.819
it, you can add as many layers as you want,
but try not to use less than 3. I used 4 balloons

00:02:15.819 --> 00:02:20.260
for this one, and the finishing step is to
add a black ninja mask. To form that, just

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:24.000
make “U” shaped cuts around the edges
of a black balloon, then fold it in half so

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.530
you can cut a “U” shape out of the side.
When you open it up you’ll have a hole right

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:30.810
through the center. And putting the mask on
the ninja ball is as simple as turning the

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:34.930
band inside out, then wrapping it around the
outside. Now try matching one of the holes

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:38.980
on the mask with the seam on the ball, and
the seam will virtually disappear. This is

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:43.189
really cool because most people will have
no idea how you made this. Just for fun I

00:02:43.189 --> 00:02:47.409
tried making a couple more balls with monochromatic
colors, and those ended with an awesome two

00:02:47.409 --> 00:02:53.700
tone effect. Then I made 4 solid green balls
with blue, purple, orange and red ninja masks.

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:58.290
Now I know you can see totally see where I’m
with this. Baby ninja turtle eggs. Now check

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:02.030
this out. If we stack them on top of each
other and push down hard, you can get a feel

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:05.959
for how squishy they really are. Not only
that, but they’ll stick to each other as

00:03:05.959 --> 00:03:10.260
well. I tried smashing them into the ground
and was amazed by how resilient they are.

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:13.510
And check out how they all formed different
shapes. I wonder if this could be classified

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:17.329
as modern art. These will hold their shape
as long as you don’t mess with them too

00:03:17.329 --> 00:03:20.670
much. And if you play around with different
color combinations, you can see just how easy

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:25.049
it is to make any superhero theme you can
think of. I tried making a whole variety of

00:03:25.049 --> 00:03:29.180
different colors, and was impressed that 1
cheap bag of flour, makes over 20 different

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:33.230
toys. The soft rubbery texture makes them
easy to grip, so they’re actually perfect

00:03:33.230 --> 00:03:37.099
for juggling, and since they’re ridiculously
cheap to make, they’re an awesome gift for

00:03:37.099 --> 00:03:41.379
kids. Well now you know how to take a sack
of flour and handful of party balloons and

00:03:41.379 --> 00:03:45.859
convert them into squishy, superhero stress
balls. Well that’s it for now. If you liked

00:03:45.859 --> 00:03:47.719
this project, perhaps you’ll like some 

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:50.460
of 
my others. Check them out at www.thekingofrandom.com
