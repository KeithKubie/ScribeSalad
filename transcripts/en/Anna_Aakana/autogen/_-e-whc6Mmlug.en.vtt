00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.180
So, a while ago, I put out a video called "I'm going on antidepressants"

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:06.740
and... the reception was very weird from my friends,

00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:09.960
Any happiness that you feel on it is going to be fake happiness.

00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:11.980
You can only find real happiness...

00:00:12.100 --> 00:00:13.260
inside of yourself.

00:00:13.300 --> 00:00:13.960
My family,

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:17.780
Honey, mental illness is just an illness...

00:00:18.580 --> 00:00:19.540
in your mental.

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:20.460
The internet,

00:00:24.540 --> 00:00:25.740
I exercise regularly,

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:28.120
eat predominantly vegan and macrobiotic meals,

00:00:28.180 --> 00:00:29.740
drink plently of water and green tea,

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:30.780
I take vitamins,

00:00:30.780 --> 00:00:31.700
I get enough sleep,

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:34.260
and I plan out enough time to relax and unwind.

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:36.620
And meds didn't cure my depression,

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:39.100
they just kind of raised the floor of it.

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:40.920
So that the bottom wasn't so far down.

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:43.980
So, I started taking ten milligrams of Lexapro about three months ago,

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:46.080
and I noticed a difference right away...

00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:49.160
and so did my boyfriend, I was like, "hey, did you- have you noticed any difference?"

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:50.100
and he was like, "yes!"

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:53.540
But, uh, about a week in, I remember I was doing a standup show

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:55.420
and I almost always do a meet and greet afterwards

00:00:55.420 --> 00:00:58.500
and... there was this long line, and I was getting through it,

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:01.800
when this lady came up to me and shouted in front of everybody

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:07.540
that she felt ripped off and cheated because she didn't think I did enough time onstage to make it worth her while.

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:10.300
Now, my normal reaction to something like that

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:12.400
would be to cry, of course, you know

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:16.700
from like, the shame and the humiliation and the- and being sad that I disappointed her

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:20.760
But there was this moment where my brain kinda paused and was like,

00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:25.900
"well, there's 250 people in line who clearly liked the show and no one else has said anything,

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:30.240
are you going to let yourself cry over one lady's opinion?"

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:33.000
And I realized in that moment, like,

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.060
oh my god, my whole life my emotions have been so extreme,

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:37.600
they're always a rollercoaster,

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:42.760
and it was the first moment of emotional clarity I had that...

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:45.880
I don't have to... cry.

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:47.760
The first four to six weeks were really rough,

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:52.220
the primary side effect I experienced was just tiredness, just being very tired all the time.

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:55.380
In a way it was great because I just read a lot of books

00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:59.040
I was like, "oh, I'm too tired to actually work, I'm just gonna lay down and read."

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:01.980
But then I would get exhausted the moment I started working out,

00:02:01.980 --> 00:02:03.140
and I'd always want to take a nap,

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:04.260
or I'd oversleep.

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:07.760
So, I've started taking my meds in the evening

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:10.280
and I can report that it is... so much better.

00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:13.600
I don't know if I'll go off of them anytime soon.

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:19.760
I really love this- this feeling of just stability that I have, you know?

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:23.480
I'm so used to being like this and being sad or really happy or really angry about everything

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:26.280
and I still get sad, you know, I still cry when it's appropriate

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:28.100
and I still get angry about a lot of things

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:32.400
and I'm still very- very happy, I'm actually more happy than I was prior to meds.

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:38.060
Um, but I have also heard stories from friends who had terrible experiences with antidepressants

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:41.680
and... they didn't want to stay on them because it made them feel weird.

00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:46.740
So I think this whole experience has kind of taught me that there is no right answer and there is no cure,

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:49.680
I think ultimately, we just kind of have to find out what works for us.

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:52.640
And luckily for me, this is working for me right now.

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:54.020
That may change, of course,

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:57.100
but right now, I've found some help.

00:02:57.100 --> 00:02:58.480
And I'm not ashamed of it.

00:02:59.300 --> 00:03:00.460
I'm Anna Akana.

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:02.120
Stay awesome, Gotham.
