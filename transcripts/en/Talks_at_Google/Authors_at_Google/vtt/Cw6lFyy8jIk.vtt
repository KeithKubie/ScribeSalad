00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:09.400
MALE SPEAKER: Good afternoon.

00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:13.310
Welcome to "Talks at
Google" in Cambridge.

00:00:13.310 --> 00:00:17.490
Today it's my great pleasure to
introduce Dr. Edward Baptist,

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:20.950
associate professor
of history at Cornell.

00:00:20.950 --> 00:00:23.750
In addition to today's
book, he is the author

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:27.840
of "Creating an Old South--
Middle Florida's Plantation

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:32.310
Frontier Before the Civil
War," and, with Louis Hyman,

00:00:32.310 --> 00:00:34.660
"American Capitalism--
A Reader,"

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:38.860
an ebook just released
by Simon and Schuster.

00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:42.900
Today marks the beginning of his
tour to discuss his new book,

00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:46.120
"The Half Has Never
Been Told-- Slavery

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:50.250
and the Making of
American Capitalism."

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:54.790
Publishers Weekly has said that
this book is, "an unapologetic,

00:00:54.790 --> 00:00:58.730
damming, and grisly account of
slavery's foundational place

00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:03.060
in the emergence of America
as a global superpower,

00:01:03.060 --> 00:01:06.630
balancing the macro lens of
statistics and national trends

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:09.650
with intimate slave narratives.

00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:12.310
Delivered in a voice
that fluidly incorporates

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:16.520
both academic objectivity
and coarse language,

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:18.900
Baptist's chronicle
exposes the taint

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:22.000
of blood in virtually all
of the wealthiest Americans

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:25.280
have inherited from
their forebearers."

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:27.805
Please join me in
welcoming Edward Baptist.

00:01:31.649 --> 00:01:33.440
EDWARD BAPTIST: Alright,
thanks, and thanks

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:39.256
to Google for having me, and
thank you for showing up.

00:01:39.256 --> 00:01:41.970
I appreciate it
and I'm not going

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:48.340
to talk about The Economist
yet, but if you have questions,

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:51.706
I don't think I can avoid them.

00:01:51.706 --> 00:01:53.080
I also noticed I
think I might be

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:55.380
the only person in the
building with a tie.

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:58.200
I expected that was
going to be the case,

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:00.600
but my wife just
got this for me,

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:04.760
so I didn't really
have a choice.

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:10.880
Alright, so I think what I'm
going to do is read a passage

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:14.040
and then talk a little bit,
and then read a passage

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:16.160
and have a few
more things to say.

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:20.020
And then, maybe, either one or
two more passages after that,

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:23.740
but I want to leave plenty of
time for questions and answers.

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:25.860
So let me start.

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:29.050
"On a bright spring
Maryland morning in 1805,

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:31.270
Charles Ball rode
comfortably on the board seat

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:35.030
of a wagon, the lead rope
of his owner's yoke of oxen

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:36.550
in his hands.

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:38.450
He was driving the
team to a little town

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:40.980
on the bank of Patuxent River.

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:44.080
Ball's latest owner-- he
had five in his 25 years--

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:45.460
was a hard man.

00:02:45.460 --> 00:02:47.000
Mr. Ballard would
make a slave work

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:50.680
in the woods on the snowiest
of days with no boots.

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:51.910
But Ball had hopes.

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:53.400
All through the
neighborhood he was

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:56.940
known as a strong intelligent
worker with a steady temper,

00:02:56.940 --> 00:02:59.530
unlike is irascible
African grandfather

00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:01.810
or as runaway father.

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:04.582
Charles Ball had been hired
out to the Washington Navy Yard

00:03:04.582 --> 00:03:06.290
and had come back
instead of running away

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:09.940
like so many others had done
when they had worked abroad.

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:13.470
Ball could figure out faster,
smarter ways to do any job.

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:15.590
And he had incentives--
a wife and children

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:17.630
owned by another white man.

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:21.880
Balls extra hours supplied his
family with food and clothing,

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:24.910
and though he would later to
laugh at his younger self,

00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:27.150
the 25-year-old
Charles Ball hoped

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:30.470
for his own and his
family's freedom.

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:31.210
He was not alone.

00:03:31.210 --> 00:03:33.640
In Maryland's decaying
tobacco economy,

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:35.640
enslavers we're allowing
many African Americans

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:37.070
to buy their freedom.

00:03:37.070 --> 00:03:41.720
The free constituted 5% of
the state's 111,000 people

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:47.510
of African descent in 1790
and they'd be 22% of 145,000

00:03:47.510 --> 00:03:48.610
by 1810.

00:03:48.610 --> 00:03:50.250
Maryland was becoming
a middle ground

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:53.330
between the slave
state and a free one."

00:03:53.330 --> 00:03:58.950
I go on to explain that
Ball gets to the town

00:03:58.950 --> 00:04:03.410
where he's bringing the team
of oxen, ties up the oxen,

00:04:03.410 --> 00:04:05.710
and goes to get a
little bit of breakfast,

00:04:05.710 --> 00:04:10.630
but he sees his owner standing
outside the stable talking

00:04:10.630 --> 00:04:13.020
with another white man.

00:04:13.020 --> 00:04:14.880
"Uneasily swallowing
a last mouthful,

00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:17.010
Ball stood up and
walked slowly out.

00:04:17.010 --> 00:04:20.057
He began hitching up the oxen
fumbling with the leather rope,

00:04:20.057 --> 00:04:22.640
suddenly he felt the presence
of several people looming around

00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:23.330
him.

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:26.420
He turned as, out of
nowhere, a dozen white men

00:04:26.420 --> 00:04:27.680
had surrounded him.

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:29.180
Before his eyes
had time to flicker

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:32.530
from one hard face to another,
his head jerked back as someone

00:04:32.530 --> 00:04:35.180
seized him by the
collar from behind.

00:04:35.180 --> 00:04:38.350
You are my property now, a
voice shouted in Ball's ear.

00:04:38.350 --> 00:04:40.420
And, as he whipped
his head around,

00:04:40.420 --> 00:04:43.140
he saw the man with whom
Ballard had been whispering.

00:04:43.140 --> 00:04:45.890
You must go to you must
go with me to Georgia,

00:04:45.890 --> 00:04:48.940
the stranger snarled."

00:04:48.940 --> 00:04:52.170
So I then set what's
happening to Ball

00:04:52.170 --> 00:04:55.521
in the context of the
larger migration that's just

00:04:55.521 --> 00:04:57.770
beginning-- a forced migration
they would, ultimately,

00:04:57.770 --> 00:05:00.560
move a million a enslaved
African Americans from older

00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:05.070
parts of the South to what
would become increasingly

00:05:05.070 --> 00:05:08.990
larger new parts of the South as
the US acquired more territory.

00:05:08.990 --> 00:05:12.710
And I talk over the course is a
book about how the slave trade

00:05:12.710 --> 00:05:17.190
to develops, changes,
and grows and becomes,

00:05:17.190 --> 00:05:19.780
in fact, the breeding ground
for a lot of innovative business

00:05:19.780 --> 00:05:22.120
practices-- for a
lot of market making,

00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:25.810
some economists might say,
for a lot of institutions.

00:05:25.810 --> 00:05:28.370
They bring buyers
and sellers together,

00:05:28.370 --> 00:05:31.340
they make information
flow more freely,

00:05:31.340 --> 00:05:33.290
they make credit
flow more freely,

00:05:33.290 --> 00:05:37.970
all in the name of moving
enslaved human beings.

00:05:37.970 --> 00:05:42.100
And I continue to follow
the story of Charles Ball.

00:05:42.100 --> 00:05:45.460
I talk about how he is actually
locked into a series of chains

00:05:45.460 --> 00:05:47.390
called a cothal,
and how the march

00:05:47.390 --> 00:05:52.220
South, with 51 other people
to whom is chained, begins.

00:05:52.220 --> 00:05:55.950
And I try to take the
reader into his mind

00:05:55.950 --> 00:06:00.130
as he described it many, many
years later-- as these events

00:06:00.130 --> 00:06:01.230
were happening.

00:06:01.230 --> 00:06:04.860
How he dreamed that night,
as he lay in chains,

00:06:04.860 --> 00:06:09.240
that his son came to try to
break the chains but could not.

00:06:09.240 --> 00:06:12.260
And how he then dreamed
about his grandfather, who

00:06:12.260 --> 00:06:15.020
I mentioned just now, his
African grandfather who had,

00:06:15.020 --> 00:06:19.110
in fact, helped Charles's own
father, the grandfather's son,

00:06:19.110 --> 00:06:22.930
to escape from slavery so
that he could not be sold.

00:06:22.930 --> 00:06:25.270
I follow this story
of Charles Ball

00:06:25.270 --> 00:06:27.140
all the way down
the South Carolina

00:06:27.140 --> 00:06:29.460
where he sold to a man
named Wade Hampton.

00:06:29.460 --> 00:06:31.780
Wade Hampton, who
was at that point

00:06:31.780 --> 00:06:35.130
already one of the wealthiest
men in the United States,

00:06:35.130 --> 00:06:38.960
and Wade Hampton put Charles
Ball on his cotton plantation.

00:06:38.960 --> 00:06:43.090
Now at this point, 1805,
cotton is a relatively new crop

00:06:43.090 --> 00:06:46.660
in the United States and it is
just moving into the position

00:06:46.660 --> 00:06:50.110
that it eventually comes to
hold in the world economy.

00:06:50.110 --> 00:06:53.290
And it holds that position for a
large part of the 19th century.

00:06:53.290 --> 00:06:56.610
That position is that of the
world's most widely traded

00:06:56.610 --> 00:06:57.840
commodity.

00:06:57.840 --> 00:07:00.560
Through most a 20th
century, that position

00:07:00.560 --> 00:07:01.840
would have been held by oil.

00:07:01.840 --> 00:07:03.710
Through most of
the 19th century,

00:07:03.710 --> 00:07:05.420
that was held by cotton.

00:07:05.420 --> 00:07:07.300
Cotton was the raw
material that was

00:07:07.300 --> 00:07:10.460
used in the factories of the
new industrial system that

00:07:10.460 --> 00:07:13.680
was emerging in England
and later in New England.

00:07:13.680 --> 00:07:16.810
It was turned into
textiles, textiles

00:07:16.810 --> 00:07:21.380
that could be turned
out at a quantity

00:07:21.380 --> 00:07:25.810
a of a variety
previously impossible

00:07:25.810 --> 00:07:30.050
with traditional modes
of hand manufacture.

00:07:30.050 --> 00:07:32.700
And they would slowly
push out other kinds

00:07:32.700 --> 00:07:34.900
of textile manufacturing
around the world

00:07:34.900 --> 00:07:38.750
and themselves become a
massively important kind

00:07:38.750 --> 00:07:41.260
of trade, massively
important commodity that's

00:07:41.260 --> 00:07:44.100
shopped all around the world.

00:07:44.100 --> 00:07:47.240
In other words, the
cotton is the raw material

00:07:47.240 --> 00:07:48.490
of the Industrial Revolution.

00:07:48.490 --> 00:07:51.410
It is the raw material in
the early modernization

00:07:51.410 --> 00:07:53.330
of the global economy.

00:07:53.330 --> 00:07:55.760
And Charles Ball would
be forced to make it.

00:07:55.760 --> 00:07:59.860
So, what's significant about how
African Americans make cotton,

00:07:59.860 --> 00:08:03.660
starting in the 1790s and going
all the way up into the Civil

00:08:03.660 --> 00:08:07.710
War, is the fact that
the cotton they made

00:08:07.710 --> 00:08:11.390
pushed other producers
out of the market.

00:08:11.390 --> 00:08:14.000
It gradually became
the dominant--

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:17.110
the US South gradually became
the dominant producer of cotton

00:08:17.110 --> 00:08:18.130
on the world market.

00:08:18.130 --> 00:08:20.920
Whereas it made almost none
at the start of the Industrial

00:08:20.920 --> 00:08:21.420
Revolution.

00:08:21.420 --> 00:08:23.390
So as the market
for the raw material

00:08:23.390 --> 00:08:28.860
is growing dramatically, not
only the ability of the US

00:08:28.860 --> 00:08:31.450
South to produce it,
but their market share

00:08:31.450 --> 00:08:33.580
is growing dramatically.

00:08:33.580 --> 00:08:35.650
And one of the
historical problems

00:08:35.650 --> 00:08:39.679
that I try to address in the
book is why that was the case.

00:08:39.679 --> 00:08:42.520
One reason is that
huge amounts of land

00:08:42.520 --> 00:08:44.980
were taken from Native
Americans, huge amounts of land

00:08:44.980 --> 00:08:49.680
were taken, were bought,
from other European powers.

00:08:49.680 --> 00:08:51.820
Later from North
American powers were

00:08:51.820 --> 00:08:54.510
seized, like the territory
that's taken from Mexico.

00:08:54.510 --> 00:08:56.950
Another piece of it,
of how this comes

00:08:56.950 --> 00:08:59.610
to pass-- of how this massive
upsurge in US cotton production

00:08:59.610 --> 00:09:02.280
comes to pass-- is
the forced migration

00:09:02.280 --> 00:09:04.120
of large numbers of
African Americans.

00:09:04.120 --> 00:09:07.200
A million people are
moved and most of them

00:09:07.200 --> 00:09:08.659
go into making cotton.

00:09:08.659 --> 00:09:10.950
And the children, if the
children are born and survive,

00:09:10.950 --> 00:09:14.350
go on to making cotton in places
like Alabama, Mississippi,

00:09:14.350 --> 00:09:16.650
Louisiana, Texas and so on.

00:09:16.650 --> 00:09:20.570
But, another piece
of it is the fact

00:09:20.570 --> 00:09:24.770
that the labor process changes,
and it changes continuously

00:09:24.770 --> 00:09:28.410
and dynamically on
the cotton frontier.

00:09:28.410 --> 00:09:35.400
So in 1805, when Charles Ball
learns how to pick cotton,

00:09:35.400 --> 00:09:38.280
he picks about 50 pounds a day.

00:09:38.280 --> 00:09:40.860
A few decades later,
the average amount

00:09:40.860 --> 00:09:44.626
picked would be two
to four times that.

00:09:44.626 --> 00:09:46.750
And one of the historical
problems I try to address

00:09:46.750 --> 00:09:52.300
is why that increase happens,
and this is something

00:09:52.300 --> 00:09:55.660
that I imagine is going to be
continued subject of debate

00:09:55.660 --> 00:09:59.260
between historians
and economists.

00:09:59.260 --> 00:10:04.530
But my explanation
ultimately is that enslavers

00:10:04.530 --> 00:10:07.870
create a system of
measurement-- they measure

00:10:07.870 --> 00:10:15.860
the day's picking of cotton--
and recording information--

00:10:15.860 --> 00:10:21.340
they write down the number of
pounds the enslaved person has

00:10:21.340 --> 00:10:25.350
picked-- and they then compare
it to a quota, a quota that

00:10:25.350 --> 00:10:28.700
is individually determined
based on their past performance.

00:10:28.700 --> 00:10:31.600
If they have not met that
quota on that particular day,

00:10:31.600 --> 00:10:32.620
they're whipped.

00:10:32.620 --> 00:10:35.120
If you've seen the film
"12 Years a Slave,"

00:10:35.120 --> 00:10:40.330
you've seen a little bit of
this dramatized on the screen.

00:10:40.330 --> 00:10:43.660
And then another piece of
it, when enslaved people

00:10:43.660 --> 00:10:47.710
learn how to meet that
quota, that quota is raised.

00:10:47.710 --> 00:10:51.340
And so over time, the average
quota of the average slave

00:10:51.340 --> 00:10:52.710
gets higher and higher.

00:10:52.710 --> 00:10:54.950
The average slave
has to learn how

00:10:54.950 --> 00:10:57.270
to meet those higher
and higher quotas.

00:10:57.270 --> 00:10:59.930
And that explains why
the price of cotton

00:10:59.930 --> 00:11:05.850
in real dollars, raw
cotton, is 15% in 1860 what

00:11:05.850 --> 00:11:08.350
it was an 1800, even
though the demand for it

00:11:08.350 --> 00:11:11.850
has increased dramatically.

00:11:11.850 --> 00:11:17.590
Alright, how did enslaved
people describe that process

00:11:17.590 --> 00:11:20.800
that they went through, the
process of being forced,

00:11:20.800 --> 00:11:23.680
of being moved-- and we've
heard a little bit of that

00:11:23.680 --> 00:11:29.000
from Charles Ball-- and then
the process of being forced

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:31.520
to raise their own
ability to produce

00:11:31.520 --> 00:11:35.420
this crucial raw material for
the Industrial Revolution?

00:11:35.420 --> 00:11:39.710
Well, at the heart
of my book, I tried

00:11:39.710 --> 00:11:43.290
to put the voices of
enslaved people themselves.

00:11:43.290 --> 00:11:47.380
This can be hard to do
because, as you may be aware,

00:11:47.380 --> 00:11:50.740
literacy was essentially
forbidden for most slaves

00:11:50.740 --> 00:11:52.700
in most states,
and, of course, they

00:11:52.700 --> 00:11:56.260
didn't have the
tools ready at hand

00:11:56.260 --> 00:11:59.630
to write and record
their thoughts.

00:11:59.630 --> 00:12:03.580
But, despite that,
we do have access

00:12:03.580 --> 00:12:07.410
to the experiences and
the thoughts of formerly

00:12:07.410 --> 00:12:12.730
enslaved people because as
people like Charles Ball-- who

00:12:12.730 --> 00:12:17.000
was not unique, but very unusual
in that he successfully escaped

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:18.970
from slavery in the deep
South, but there were

00:12:18.970 --> 00:12:22.230
other people like him-- as
people like Charles Ball

00:12:22.230 --> 00:12:28.350
escape, many of them were able
to find people to help them

00:12:28.350 --> 00:12:30.800
write down their memoirs,
create their autobiographies,

00:12:30.800 --> 00:12:31.890
and publish them.

00:12:31.890 --> 00:12:34.004
And this became the
basis, in many ways,

00:12:34.004 --> 00:12:35.420
for the abolitionist
movement that

00:12:35.420 --> 00:12:38.210
would ultimately oppose slavery.

00:12:38.210 --> 00:12:40.810
They're about hundreds of
those published autobiographies

00:12:40.810 --> 00:12:43.650
from the 19th century of
formally enslaved people,

00:12:43.650 --> 00:12:46.430
and they're a great
source for studying

00:12:46.430 --> 00:12:49.880
what the experience of
slavery was actually like.

00:12:49.880 --> 00:12:52.600
On the other hand,
in the 1930s, there

00:12:52.600 --> 00:12:55.416
were still thousands of
formally enslaved people alive,

00:12:55.416 --> 00:12:57.790
and the federal government,
as part of the Works Progress

00:12:57.790 --> 00:13:01.020
Administration, one of these
agencies of the New Deal

00:13:01.020 --> 00:13:03.330
that was trying to put
people back to work

00:13:03.330 --> 00:13:06.660
hires different individuals--
some of them graduate students,

00:13:06.660 --> 00:13:11.840
some of them unemployed
teachers, some of them

00:13:11.840 --> 00:13:14.660
locally prominent
spouses of judges,

00:13:14.660 --> 00:13:18.080
and so on and so forth--
anybody who had the ability

00:13:18.080 --> 00:13:20.830
to go and make connections
with former slaves

00:13:20.830 --> 00:13:23.910
was sent out into different
neighborhoods and communities

00:13:23.910 --> 00:13:25.150
around the country.

00:13:25.150 --> 00:13:27.700
And all in all, about
2,200 interviews

00:13:27.700 --> 00:13:30.760
were done with formerly
enslaved people,

00:13:30.760 --> 00:13:33.510
and these narratives are
also crucial to the story

00:13:33.510 --> 00:13:34.520
that I tell.

00:13:34.520 --> 00:13:37.500
I try to put those things
at the center of the story

00:13:37.500 --> 00:13:43.390
and, as we can talk about later,
that is in itself, as it turns

00:13:43.390 --> 00:13:46.750
out, something of a
controversial act.

00:13:46.750 --> 00:13:54.210
Alright, so there was one person
who gave his testimony to a WPA

00:13:54.210 --> 00:13:57.250
interview named Henry
Clay-- probably named

00:13:57.250 --> 00:14:01.720
after the famous American
politician, born about 1840--

00:14:01.720 --> 00:14:05.415
and he told his story to
his interviewer in the 1930s

00:14:05.415 --> 00:14:09.010
and I think it's
really interesting.

00:14:09.010 --> 00:14:12.880
And he claimed he'd been born
into slavery in the Carolinas

00:14:12.880 --> 00:14:15.820
and moved to Louisiana
has as a boy.

00:14:15.820 --> 00:14:17.680
And he grew up on
a cotton plantation

00:14:17.680 --> 00:14:22.210
in Louisiana, being forced
to work faster and faster.

00:14:22.210 --> 00:14:24.010
And he claimed to
his interviewer

00:14:24.010 --> 00:14:27.030
that his owner once
possessed a machine, which

00:14:27.030 --> 00:14:31.470
by his own account made cotton
cultivation and harvesting

00:14:31.470 --> 00:14:34.140
mechanical and
rapid and efficient.

00:14:34.140 --> 00:14:36.940
And, by the way, there was
no mechanical cotton picker,

00:14:36.940 --> 00:14:41.470
no machine that would do the
job slaves did until the 130s.

00:14:41.470 --> 00:14:44.060
It turned out to be a very
difficult engineering problem

00:14:44.060 --> 00:14:47.930
to solve, but his
owner supposedly

00:14:47.930 --> 00:14:50.420
had a machine that
solved the problem

00:14:50.420 --> 00:14:53.100
to some extent, the problem
of how to pick more cotton.

00:14:53.100 --> 00:14:56.570
Because, of course, the more
cotton your slaves picked,

00:14:56.570 --> 00:14:59.220
the more pounds of
cotton would sell,

00:14:59.220 --> 00:15:03.060
the higher your total revenue
would be as a slave owner.

00:15:03.060 --> 00:15:06.080
So "this machine was
a big wooden wheel,

00:15:06.080 --> 00:15:08.330
as Clay remembered,
with a treadle on it.

00:15:08.330 --> 00:15:09.830
And when you tromped
on the treadle,

00:15:09.830 --> 00:15:11.950
the big wheel goes around.

00:15:11.950 --> 00:15:14.660
On that wheel was four or
five leather straps with holes

00:15:14.660 --> 00:15:17.150
cut in them to make blisters.

00:15:17.150 --> 00:15:20.190
And you lay the Negro down
on his face, on a bench,

00:15:20.190 --> 00:15:21.940
and tie to it.

00:15:21.940 --> 00:15:24.970
Now, when the operator pumped
the treadle to turn the wheel,

00:15:24.970 --> 00:15:28.070
the straps thrashed the back
of the man or woman tied

00:15:28.070 --> 00:15:30.490
to the bench into bloody jelly.

00:15:30.490 --> 00:15:33.250
According to Clay, the mere
threat of the whipping machine

00:15:33.250 --> 00:15:36.100
was enough to speed
his own hands."

00:15:36.100 --> 00:15:38.380
Now, the contraption might
have actually existed,

00:15:38.380 --> 00:15:40.520
but I actually think it did not.

00:15:40.520 --> 00:15:42.210
I think it was not
a material thing,

00:15:42.210 --> 00:15:44.210
but it was actually a metaphor.

00:15:44.210 --> 00:15:47.020
I think he saying that every
cotton labor camp carved out

00:15:47.020 --> 00:15:50.960
of the Southwestern woods used
torture, used whipping as it

00:15:50.960 --> 00:15:52.000
central technology.

00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:54.510
And so every day--
with measurement,

00:15:54.510 --> 00:15:56.610
with recourse to the
information that was already

00:15:56.610 --> 00:15:58.360
recorded about
people's production,

00:15:58.360 --> 00:16:00.910
and then with whipping of
those who didn't actually

00:16:00.910 --> 00:16:04.710
succeed in meeting their
quota-- calibrated pain

00:16:04.710 --> 00:16:08.450
was being used to
push enslaved people

00:16:08.450 --> 00:16:13.390
to exceed their previous
day's gains in production.

00:16:13.390 --> 00:16:15.630
This was a kind of
technology, a technology

00:16:15.630 --> 00:16:19.180
of whips, and measuring
weights, and slate--

00:16:19.180 --> 00:16:23.130
where the pounds would be
recorded-- which forced people

00:16:23.130 --> 00:16:26.460
to focus their minds on
inventing new ways to perform

00:16:26.460 --> 00:16:29.520
repetitive and mind
numbing labor at nearly

00:16:29.520 --> 00:16:31.230
impossible speed.

00:16:31.230 --> 00:16:35.470
Fingertips hardened, but also
became more subtle and swift.

00:16:35.470 --> 00:16:38.130
Enslaved people developed
different tricks,

00:16:38.130 --> 00:16:40.570
ways to get down the row
with as little wasted

00:16:40.570 --> 00:16:42.024
movement as possible.

00:16:42.024 --> 00:16:44.440
Some of their new discoveries
they could teach each other,

00:16:44.440 --> 00:16:48.350
but, ultimately, one also had
to-- and you get some of this

00:16:48.350 --> 00:16:50.400
from some of the ex-slave
interviews-- they

00:16:50.400 --> 00:16:53.100
had to split their own
consciousness in half

00:16:53.100 --> 00:16:55.800
in some ways-- to be
present but not be present,

00:16:55.800 --> 00:17:01.230
to generate unseen creativity in
movement, new graces of speed.

00:17:01.230 --> 00:17:02.960
And this was the
key, I would argue,

00:17:02.960 --> 00:17:06.230
to the astonishing increase
of cotton production

00:17:06.230 --> 00:17:10.349
over time, which is extremely
important to the creation

00:17:10.349 --> 00:17:11.460
of the modern economy.

00:17:11.460 --> 00:17:16.650
Because, of course, raw cotton,
at 15% of its earlier price,

00:17:16.650 --> 00:17:20.910
enables the factory owners,
who are processing that

00:17:20.910 --> 00:17:23.680
into one of the most
important commodities

00:17:23.680 --> 00:17:25.520
that they sell-- the
cotton textiles which

00:17:25.520 --> 00:17:28.680
go all over the world and
invade all kinds of markets

00:17:28.680 --> 00:17:33.670
from India, to China, to
Africa, to Latin America--

00:17:33.670 --> 00:17:36.630
it allows them to lower
the price of their product.

00:17:36.630 --> 00:17:40.700
It allows them to skim off
revenues and reinvest them

00:17:40.700 --> 00:17:41.670
new machines.

00:17:41.670 --> 00:17:43.870
It allows them to pay
slightly higher wages

00:17:43.870 --> 00:17:47.440
to workers, which dampens
down industrial unrest.

00:17:47.440 --> 00:17:51.290
And so the increase productivity
on the cotton plantation

00:17:51.290 --> 00:17:53.600
is one of the keys,
one of the keys

00:17:53.600 --> 00:17:57.440
that makes all of
those things possible.

00:17:57.440 --> 00:18:01.840
Let me transition
to one more reading.

00:18:01.840 --> 00:18:04.330
And this reading
brings us to Boston.

00:18:04.330 --> 00:18:09.260
This reading brings us from
Maryland, South Carolina,

00:18:09.260 --> 00:18:13.710
and Louisiana,
specifically, to Boston.

00:18:13.710 --> 00:18:16.080
Boston was closely
linked to the things that

00:18:16.080 --> 00:18:19.410
were happening on
the cotton frontier.

00:18:19.410 --> 00:18:23.160
And not just because
the textile factories

00:18:23.160 --> 00:18:26.810
that boomed, that were so
important to the Massachusetts

00:18:26.810 --> 00:18:29.980
economy in Lowell and
other parts of the state,

00:18:29.980 --> 00:18:33.810
were-- most of them-- were owned
by men and women who lived here

00:18:33.810 --> 00:18:34.310
in Boston.

00:18:37.060 --> 00:18:41.020
Well, one of the members
of the class of people

00:18:41.020 --> 00:18:43.940
who owned those factories
had a particularly direct

00:18:43.940 --> 00:18:47.570
relationship to
Louisiana cotton fields.

00:18:47.570 --> 00:18:51.150
And this was a man named
John Gorham Palfry,

00:18:51.150 --> 00:18:53.490
and he actually lived
in Louisiana briefly

00:18:53.490 --> 00:18:56.610
because his father
John Palfry, the elder,

00:18:56.610 --> 00:19:00.390
had been a merchant
in Boston, but then

00:19:00.390 --> 00:19:03.820
had bought Louisiana
plantation-- about 1804--

00:19:03.820 --> 00:19:05.300
and move down there.

00:19:05.300 --> 00:19:10.050
And he moved his five sons, one
of them, John Gorham Palfry,

00:19:10.050 --> 00:19:10.960
was the oldest.

00:19:10.960 --> 00:19:16.830
And he left Louisiana when he
turned 18 and moved back up

00:19:16.830 --> 00:19:18.290
here to go to Harvard.

00:19:18.290 --> 00:19:21.700
And at Harvard he was ordained
as Unitarian minister.

00:19:21.700 --> 00:19:24.600
He ran a church for awhile,
became a professor of theology.

00:19:24.600 --> 00:19:27.540
So he was a Harvard professor.

00:19:27.540 --> 00:19:30.370
And then, late in
the 1830s, he took

00:19:30.370 --> 00:19:33.460
over a magazine called "The
North American Review."

00:19:33.460 --> 00:19:35.380
And the "North American
Review" was a sort

00:19:35.380 --> 00:19:39.740
of "New York Review of Books"
or "Atlantic" or something

00:19:39.740 --> 00:19:41.700
along those lines of the '30s.

00:19:41.700 --> 00:19:44.540
It was the magazine
of a national,

00:19:44.540 --> 00:19:48.120
educated middle
class-- published

00:19:48.120 --> 00:19:50.810
authors of America's emerging
literature, James Fenimore

00:19:50.810 --> 00:19:54.710
Cooper, William Cullen
Bryant, et cetera, et cetera.

00:19:54.710 --> 00:19:56.480
His four brothers were
still in Louisiana

00:19:56.480 --> 00:19:59.170
and they gradually took over
their father's cotton operation

00:19:59.170 --> 00:20:01.750
as he older.

00:20:01.750 --> 00:20:05.100
The brothers stayed in
contact and John Gorham Palfry

00:20:05.100 --> 00:20:07.710
sometimes went down
to Louisiana to visit.

00:20:07.710 --> 00:20:12.240
In the 1830s, he came down,
went back up to Boston,

00:20:12.240 --> 00:20:15.070
and he wrote letters
that asked ironically

00:20:15.070 --> 00:20:19.460
after individual enslaved people
in terms of racist parody, "How

00:20:19.460 --> 00:20:22.590
are my sooty friends?" he wrote.

00:20:22.590 --> 00:20:25.280
When William contemplated, one
of his brother's, contemplated

00:20:25.280 --> 00:20:27.400
visiting Boston,
John the younger

00:20:27.400 --> 00:20:29.640
told him to bring his own slave.

00:20:29.640 --> 00:20:31.520
"The free black servants
you can hire here

00:20:31.520 --> 00:20:34.130
are good for nothing," he said.

00:20:34.130 --> 00:20:38.070
The Palfry's agreed, it
seemed, on slavery and race

00:20:38.070 --> 00:20:39.550
as they did on
national politics.

00:20:39.550 --> 00:20:42.420
They were both part
of the Whig party.

00:20:42.420 --> 00:20:46.800
Well, as John the elder aged--
this is John Gorham's father--

00:20:46.800 --> 00:20:49.860
the Louisiana Palfry's took care
to advise their Massachusetts

00:20:49.860 --> 00:20:54.820
brothers that under the terms
of the Louisiana civil code--

00:20:54.820 --> 00:20:58.500
that's a Napoleonic
form of law--

00:20:58.500 --> 00:21:01.200
he would inherit, automatically,
one third of his father's

00:21:01.200 --> 00:21:01.700
property.

00:21:01.700 --> 00:21:04.060
One of the brothers had
died in the meantime.

00:21:04.060 --> 00:21:07.030
Most of the value of that
property was in slaves.

00:21:07.030 --> 00:21:09.810
The best way to turn that
share into money usable

00:21:09.810 --> 00:21:13.260
in Massachusetts would be to
sell the people he inherited.

00:21:13.260 --> 00:21:15.160
"But you might incur
the risk," wrote

00:21:15.160 --> 00:21:18.040
one of his brothers, "of some
busy abolitionist reporting

00:21:18.040 --> 00:21:20.580
that the Reverend Dr,
Palfry had been selling

00:21:20.580 --> 00:21:22.530
human flesh, et
cetera, et cetera.

00:21:22.530 --> 00:21:25.310
Or living on the
income of slave labor."

00:21:25.310 --> 00:21:27.520
So Boston at this time
was also becoming,

00:21:27.520 --> 00:21:31.200
not just the bed of textile
money and textile innovation,

00:21:31.200 --> 00:21:36.700
but abolitionist critique
of slavery in the South.

00:21:36.700 --> 00:21:40.220
In the autumn of 1843, one of
the season's first cotton ships

00:21:40.220 --> 00:21:45.490
arriving in Boston to offload
cotton for Lowell also

00:21:45.490 --> 00:21:47.450
brought news from New Orleans.

00:21:47.450 --> 00:21:50.730
Old John Palfry had died
and John Gorham Palfry now

00:21:50.730 --> 00:21:52.910
owned 20 human beings.

00:21:52.910 --> 00:21:55.790
And so at this point,
something unexpectedly happens.

00:21:55.790 --> 00:21:58.110
John the younger
decides he doesn't

00:21:58.110 --> 00:22:00.920
want any more
money from slavery.

00:22:00.920 --> 00:22:02.790
And so he tells
his brother that he

00:22:02.790 --> 00:22:07.340
wants to free all of the slaves,
but Louisiana law at that point

00:22:07.340 --> 00:22:09.590
will not allow him to do that.

00:22:09.590 --> 00:22:13.560
At least not if they
remain in Louisiana itself.

00:22:13.560 --> 00:22:16.770
The brothers, the other
brothers, try to talk about it

00:22:16.770 --> 00:22:20.600
and they're becoming
increasingly angry at him.

00:22:20.600 --> 00:22:22.920
In fact, when they
disagree with him,

00:22:22.920 --> 00:22:26.100
he goes around them, sends a
petition to the Louisiana state

00:22:26.100 --> 00:22:28.160
legislature for an
exemption to the law,

00:22:28.160 --> 00:22:30.530
forbidding the freeing
of slaves who would then

00:22:30.530 --> 00:22:35.560
remain in Louisiana near
their families and so on.

00:22:35.560 --> 00:22:38.100
One of the brothers writes
angrily back to John,

00:22:38.100 --> 00:22:39.770
"The whole story
would be published

00:22:39.770 --> 00:22:41.550
in the local paper on Saturday."

00:22:41.550 --> 00:22:44.670
Local planters, their
neighbors, would hear it.

00:22:44.670 --> 00:22:46.640
They would get questions.

00:22:46.640 --> 00:22:49.070
Their neighbors
would think that they

00:22:49.070 --> 00:22:52.560
were from a family
of abolitionists.

00:22:52.560 --> 00:22:54.120
Meanwhile, proposing
emancipation

00:22:54.120 --> 00:22:57.290
for 20 of the people at
their father slave labor camp

00:22:57.290 --> 00:23:00.070
would render the
other 40 unmanageable.

00:23:00.070 --> 00:23:02.890
They would talk back to
overseers or run to New Orleans

00:23:02.890 --> 00:23:05.160
to find a lawyer
for a freedom suit.

00:23:05.160 --> 00:23:07.930
Better to let them remain
quietly at work and time

00:23:07.930 --> 00:23:09.880
will gradually settle
all difficulties,

00:23:09.880 --> 00:23:11.660
one of the brothers insisted.

00:23:11.660 --> 00:23:13.580
Don't rock the boat.

00:23:13.580 --> 00:23:15.570
But John rocks the boat.

00:23:15.570 --> 00:23:18.530
And, eventually, he
travels down the Ohio River

00:23:18.530 --> 00:23:22.620
and brings back 17
of the 20 people

00:23:22.620 --> 00:23:28.290
who then become part of
Boston's free black community.

00:23:28.290 --> 00:23:34.020
And I want to end
with this because it's

00:23:34.020 --> 00:23:35.240
a complicated story.

00:23:35.240 --> 00:23:39.010
Palfry doesn't seem--
even after his conversion

00:23:39.010 --> 00:23:40.800
to not wanting the
profit of slaves

00:23:40.800 --> 00:23:45.910
anymore, and being willing to
fight his brothers in this way

00:23:45.910 --> 00:23:52.020
to free those 20 slaves-- he
doesn't seem to be particularly

00:23:52.020 --> 00:23:56.030
anti-racist by any terms that
we would understand today.

00:23:56.030 --> 00:24:01.530
But, despite that,
he does carry out

00:24:01.530 --> 00:24:03.730
this act, which was
very difficult for him.

00:24:03.730 --> 00:24:06.450
It was costly to him-- not
just in monetary terms,

00:24:06.450 --> 00:24:10.240
but in terms of his
relationship to his family.

00:24:10.240 --> 00:24:13.160
And even in terms of his
relationship to other Boston

00:24:13.160 --> 00:24:15.130
elites, who are by
no means abolitionist

00:24:15.130 --> 00:24:16.680
in the early 1840s.

00:24:16.680 --> 00:24:18.780
There are people in
his social circle

00:24:18.780 --> 00:24:22.150
who stop talking to him,
who stopped inviting him

00:24:22.150 --> 00:24:23.700
to the best parties.

00:24:23.700 --> 00:24:26.350
He paid a price, certainly
not the kind of price

00:24:26.350 --> 00:24:31.450
that Charles Ball paid for
slavery for opposing slavery,

00:24:31.450 --> 00:24:35.479
but a significant
price all the same.

00:24:35.479 --> 00:24:37.020
And in the book I
try to explore some

00:24:37.020 --> 00:24:38.820
of the reasons
why that might be,

00:24:38.820 --> 00:24:42.150
the gradual resentment
of some northern elites

00:24:42.150 --> 00:24:45.540
against southern political
power which protected slavery.

00:24:45.540 --> 00:24:49.770
But I think the essence
of what happened

00:24:49.770 --> 00:24:52.460
here, that I want to pull out
in the case of John Palfry,

00:24:52.460 --> 00:24:55.870
is that despite the multiple
kinds of cost-- and we have

00:24:55.870 --> 00:24:57.410
to acknowledge the
kinds of cost you

00:24:57.410 --> 00:24:59.830
pay-- despite the
multiple kinds of cost,

00:24:59.830 --> 00:25:03.170
he made a choice in his own
time to forgo those things

00:25:03.170 --> 00:25:06.670
and do something that had an
impact that went beyond the 17

00:25:06.670 --> 00:25:08.430
people who were freed.

00:25:08.430 --> 00:25:10.040
It was a political act.

00:25:10.040 --> 00:25:13.200
It was a political act that,
in its own way, as I explore

00:25:13.200 --> 00:25:16.340
the book, helped to change
the nature of anti-slavery

00:25:16.340 --> 00:25:17.530
in Massachusetts.

00:25:17.530 --> 00:25:20.410
So I think the lesson
here is, don't be evil,

00:25:20.410 --> 00:25:22.600
which you may have heard before.

00:25:22.600 --> 00:25:24.180
But, it's a tough choice.

00:25:24.180 --> 00:25:25.960
It's a tough choice
when you're going up

00:25:25.960 --> 00:25:30.390
against deeply embedded
social and economic realities.

00:25:30.390 --> 00:25:32.650
Deeply embedded social
and economic interests.

00:25:32.650 --> 00:25:35.640
And John Palfrey, to his
credit, made that choice.

00:25:35.640 --> 00:25:42.160
So I'll stop, and do we
do Q&amp;A at this point?

00:25:42.160 --> 00:25:44.340
Thank you, by the way.

00:25:44.340 --> 00:25:46.030
AUDIENCE: My curiosity--
so John Palfry

00:25:46.030 --> 00:25:48.150
came back up with
17 of his 20 slaves.

00:25:48.150 --> 00:25:49.660
What happened to
the other three?

00:25:49.660 --> 00:25:53.190
EDWARD BAPTIST: Yeah,
that's a good question.

00:25:53.190 --> 00:26:00.220
So part of the story
that I left out

00:26:00.220 --> 00:26:08.050
is this-- He goes down to
Louisiana to bring slaves back,

00:26:08.050 --> 00:26:10.890
to bring them back as
emancipated people.

00:26:10.890 --> 00:26:14.790
And they convinced him--
and this is all 20 of them,

00:26:14.790 --> 00:26:17.170
really-- convinced
him that he needs

00:26:17.170 --> 00:26:19.590
to wait-- I think it's July
when he goes down there--

00:26:19.590 --> 00:26:21.880
he needs to wait to
the end of the year.

00:26:21.880 --> 00:26:25.010
Because they had their
own little gardens

00:26:25.010 --> 00:26:29.310
that they were able to spend
some time on at the end

00:26:29.310 --> 00:26:33.190
of Saturday workday and
over Sunday working on.

00:26:33.190 --> 00:26:35.950
And the 1840s cotton
prices are not so good,

00:26:35.950 --> 00:26:38.580
and so sometimes they would be
allowed-- not just half the day

00:26:38.580 --> 00:26:40.260
on Saturday, but
maybe from 10 AM

00:26:40.260 --> 00:26:42.410
on-- to work there
because there's not

00:26:42.410 --> 00:26:45.880
so much of an interest in
producing as much cotton

00:26:45.880 --> 00:26:48.840
when the prices is so low.

00:26:48.840 --> 00:26:52.800
So they have these
crops they're growing

00:26:52.800 --> 00:26:54.440
in these little gardens.

00:26:54.440 --> 00:26:56.309
And some of them have
cows, some of them

00:26:56.309 --> 00:26:57.850
have planted little
patches of cotton

00:26:57.850 --> 00:27:00.230
that they're going to
try to sell as well.

00:27:00.230 --> 00:27:01.847
And typically enslaved
people did this

00:27:01.847 --> 00:27:03.430
so they could get a
little bit of cash

00:27:03.430 --> 00:27:05.596
to supplement their rations,
which we usually pretty

00:27:05.596 --> 00:27:10.490
bad-- maybe to buy some
ribbon, some buttons, something

00:27:10.490 --> 00:27:14.660
like that that went beyond the
sort of standard issue clothes.

00:27:14.660 --> 00:27:18.490
But these folks want
to sell what they've

00:27:18.490 --> 00:27:22.750
raised at the end of the year
when it's ready to harvest

00:27:22.750 --> 00:27:24.530
and bring the money
back up to Boston

00:27:24.530 --> 00:27:26.430
with them, because
they don't totally

00:27:26.430 --> 00:27:31.020
trust John Palfry, the
son of their slave owner.

00:27:31.020 --> 00:27:33.820
They want to have a little
bit of a cash reserve

00:27:33.820 --> 00:27:36.627
so that they can
stake themselves

00:27:36.627 --> 00:27:38.960
to some kind of independence
when they get up to Boston.

00:27:38.960 --> 00:27:42.760
And, in fact, he tries
to place most of them

00:27:42.760 --> 00:27:46.220
in different jobs,
usually very menial jobs.

00:27:46.220 --> 00:27:49.880
And their tendency is
more to slip off and do

00:27:49.880 --> 00:27:53.200
their own thing-- in some
cases, start their businesses.

00:27:53.200 --> 00:27:56.150
Well, in that intervening
time period-- and this

00:27:56.150 --> 00:28:00.060
gets back your question--
three of the oldest slaves

00:28:00.060 --> 00:28:03.860
decide that they want
to stay in Louisiana.

00:28:03.860 --> 00:28:05.930
They're all, I
think, over 50, which

00:28:05.930 --> 00:28:08.590
is quite old for
enslaved people Louisiana

00:28:08.590 --> 00:28:09.990
at that point in time.

00:28:09.990 --> 00:28:12.870
And they have children
and grandchildren there.

00:28:12.870 --> 00:28:15.330
And those children and
grandchildren had not

00:28:15.330 --> 00:28:18.610
been freed, had not been
willed to John Palfrey.

00:28:18.610 --> 00:28:23.120
So essentially, the other
brothers cut a deal.

00:28:23.120 --> 00:28:25.950
They say, we will let
them live on the fringes

00:28:25.950 --> 00:28:29.960
of our plantations, will
understand that they're free,

00:28:29.960 --> 00:28:32.530
but we just won't talk about
that to our neighbors too much.

00:28:37.670 --> 00:28:42.020
AUDIENCE: So there's an argument
that South was held back

00:28:42.020 --> 00:28:44.370
because of slavery
from industrializing

00:28:44.370 --> 00:28:46.960
like the North did and
so on and so forth.

00:28:46.960 --> 00:28:48.770
But, based on the
subtitle, is sounds

00:28:48.770 --> 00:28:50.350
like your thesis
is that slavery is

00:28:50.350 --> 00:28:53.010
very important in
American capitalism.

00:28:53.010 --> 00:28:55.260
How do you kind of draw
those two together?

00:28:58.150 --> 00:29:01.060
EDWARD BAPTIST: So are at
least two different questions,

00:29:01.060 --> 00:29:02.740
I think, embedded in that.

00:29:02.740 --> 00:29:04.980
I mean, one is, was
the South held back?

00:29:04.980 --> 00:29:07.930
And the other-- was
slavery a plus or minus

00:29:07.930 --> 00:29:10.500
for American
capitalism in general?

00:29:10.500 --> 00:29:12.410
I think for the
second one, I think

00:29:12.410 --> 00:29:14.305
I would argue
unquestionably yes.

00:29:14.305 --> 00:29:16.870
It brought massive
export earnings

00:29:16.870 --> 00:29:18.440
into the United States.

00:29:18.440 --> 00:29:21.060
It was 50% of all the
export earnings of US

00:29:21.060 --> 00:29:24.250
and, virtually, every year
from 1800 to 1860-- 50%

00:29:24.250 --> 00:29:25.870
came from cotton, I should say.

00:29:25.870 --> 00:29:28.040
And then, if you added
some of the other crops,

00:29:28.040 --> 00:29:31.840
it even creeps a little higher
when you look at slavery share.

00:29:31.840 --> 00:29:36.230
Also, because it was exporting
all of these relatively

00:29:36.230 --> 00:29:39.520
high value commodities, or
high demand commodities-- let's

00:29:39.520 --> 00:29:44.560
put it that way-- created
a circuit of payment

00:29:44.560 --> 00:29:48.610
and repayment that brought
huge amounts of credit

00:29:48.610 --> 00:29:51.730
into the American economy
on an annual basis.

00:29:51.730 --> 00:29:53.440
British investors,
in particular,

00:29:53.440 --> 00:29:55.840
and a lot of the world savings
were pulling in Britain

00:29:55.840 --> 00:29:57.440
at that point in time.

00:29:57.440 --> 00:30:00.240
British investors were
very eager to invest

00:30:00.240 --> 00:30:03.450
in that whole circuit
of trade and repayment.

00:30:03.450 --> 00:30:05.970
And so other
industries piggybacked

00:30:05.970 --> 00:30:07.730
on that stream of credit.

00:30:07.730 --> 00:30:09.950
And we could go on
about this, but I

00:30:09.950 --> 00:30:13.730
think that there are multiple
ways in which slavery helps

00:30:13.730 --> 00:30:17.000
American capitalism in general.

00:30:17.000 --> 00:30:19.300
But, it does so at
a tremendous cost.

00:30:19.300 --> 00:30:21.530
First of all, to enslave people.

00:30:21.530 --> 00:30:24.660
Second of all, I'd
argue, you could argue,

00:30:24.660 --> 00:30:28.090
creates winners and losers in
both the North and the South

00:30:28.090 --> 00:30:29.480
among free people.

00:30:29.480 --> 00:30:31.840
And, potentially,
the whole South

00:30:31.840 --> 00:30:35.800
ends up being a loser
because of the commitment

00:30:35.800 --> 00:30:38.930
to slavery and to the
production, ultimately, of one

00:30:38.930 --> 00:30:40.540
major commodity.

00:30:40.540 --> 00:30:43.610
And over the long run,
I think that's true.

00:30:43.610 --> 00:30:46.660
I think that's pretty consistent
with the experience of most

00:30:46.660 --> 00:30:50.940
regions that invest themselves
so heavily in producing one

00:30:50.940 --> 00:30:53.310
commodity no matter how
important that is to the world

00:30:53.310 --> 00:30:54.860
economy.

00:30:54.860 --> 00:30:58.380
But, as long as the
ride is going well,

00:30:58.380 --> 00:31:01.330
it can be a great ride
for the people who

00:31:01.330 --> 00:31:04.600
are sitting at the
top of that process.

00:31:04.600 --> 00:31:06.790
And when you look
at the way wealth

00:31:06.790 --> 00:31:11.066
is distributed among whites
and the United States in 1865,

00:31:11.066 --> 00:31:14.260
five of the six
highest states in terms

00:31:14.260 --> 00:31:19.590
of per capita wealth for white
people are cotton states.

00:31:19.590 --> 00:31:20.910
I always forget the order.

00:31:20.910 --> 00:31:22.750
I know Louisiana's
first, and then

00:31:22.750 --> 00:31:26.450
you also have-- in that
number you have Mississippi,

00:31:26.450 --> 00:31:32.610
and Alabama, Florida, and I
think George's the other one.

00:31:32.610 --> 00:31:38.110
But, this produces a very
prosperous upper, and even

00:31:38.110 --> 00:31:39.850
a very prosperous middle class.

00:31:39.850 --> 00:31:43.600
And they don't have an
incentive to change the system.

00:31:43.600 --> 00:31:47.040
Even if over the long run,
we can look back and say

00:31:47.040 --> 00:31:50.130
the choices that
were made, the choice

00:31:50.130 --> 00:31:52.830
to invest in cash
commodity production,

00:31:52.830 --> 00:31:56.000
didn't lead to a sort
of complex local economy

00:31:56.000 --> 00:31:59.361
that you saw in Boston,
that you saw in New England

00:31:59.361 --> 00:31:59.985
more generally.

00:32:03.280 --> 00:32:04.790
You also have to
reckon with in fact

00:32:04.790 --> 00:32:06.220
that the Civil War
happened, which

00:32:06.220 --> 00:32:11.460
not only stripped the southern
states of 20% of the accounting

00:32:11.460 --> 00:32:13.800
wealth, the wealth on the
books of the country-- which

00:32:13.800 --> 00:32:18.390
is enslaved people--
and thus left them

00:32:18.390 --> 00:32:20.840
at a much lower
position financially

00:32:20.840 --> 00:32:22.750
than they had been before.

00:32:22.750 --> 00:32:25.380
But, in addition to
that, creates a lot

00:32:25.380 --> 00:32:28.840
of physical devastation
throughout the south as well.

00:32:28.840 --> 00:32:30.960
I don't say that to say
we should feel sorry

00:32:30.960 --> 00:32:33.640
for Southern planters
because of Sherman's March.

00:32:33.640 --> 00:32:35.100
They started the war.

00:32:35.100 --> 00:32:41.750
They, to my lights, committed
treason against the government,

00:32:41.750 --> 00:32:44.306
but it does have
a long term effect

00:32:44.306 --> 00:32:45.930
on the future
development of the South.

00:32:48.760 --> 00:32:50.820
AUDIENCE: You started
off at the very beginning

00:32:50.820 --> 00:32:55.530
by referring, inevitably,
to "The Economist" review.

00:32:55.530 --> 00:32:58.550
Obviously, the book is going
to have a certain reception

00:32:58.550 --> 00:33:02.190
in the world where there
are established agendas,

00:33:02.190 --> 00:33:05.140
but I'm curious in academia.

00:33:05.140 --> 00:33:08.690
Among economists and
historians, there's

00:33:08.690 --> 00:33:15.970
probably been a lot of research,
an ongoing dialogue over years

00:33:15.970 --> 00:33:19.440
and decades that most
of us are unaware of.

00:33:19.440 --> 00:33:22.220
Where does this book
and your research

00:33:22.220 --> 00:33:27.180
fall then in an ongoing
dialogue and debate?

00:33:27.180 --> 00:33:29.305
EDWARD BAPTIST: Now, that's
a really good question.

00:33:35.370 --> 00:33:41.350
I think that there are
certainly things about my book

00:33:41.350 --> 00:33:45.310
that I, as the author would
argue, are new and innovative.

00:33:45.310 --> 00:33:47.830
And I could talk about
them in just a second.

00:33:47.830 --> 00:33:52.080
But, at the same time, there
is this long debate about

00:33:52.080 --> 00:33:53.570
was slavery capitalists?

00:33:53.570 --> 00:33:55.705
To what extent, if
it was capitalistic,

00:33:55.705 --> 00:33:59.330
did it contribute to the larger
development of capitalism?

00:33:59.330 --> 00:34:02.050
Or perhaps,
alternatively, it was

00:34:02.050 --> 00:34:04.830
something that put the
brakes on the development

00:34:04.830 --> 00:34:07.750
of the modern economy-- not just
in the South, but elsewhere.

00:34:07.750 --> 00:34:10.840
I've laid out where I stand
on the last point, certainly.

00:34:10.840 --> 00:34:13.690
But I'm not the only person
who would make the argument

00:34:13.690 --> 00:34:17.010
that there are key
things about slavery--

00:34:17.010 --> 00:34:19.630
as a set of institutions
and practices,

00:34:19.630 --> 00:34:26.920
as a culture-- that make it more
like the rest of the emerging

00:34:26.920 --> 00:34:31.000
Western capitalist complex
in the early 19th century

00:34:31.000 --> 00:34:32.870
than it is less like.

00:34:32.870 --> 00:34:35.465
More alike, more
part of, than it

00:34:35.465 --> 00:34:37.365
is different, than
it is separate.

00:34:37.365 --> 00:34:44.620
That it is just one flavor in
a larger banquet of capitalism,

00:34:44.620 --> 00:34:47.110
and it contributes
to the overall whole.

00:34:47.110 --> 00:34:48.900
And there are
number of historians

00:34:48.900 --> 00:34:50.630
who would argue that.

00:34:50.630 --> 00:34:52.900
There are also some
economists, but I

00:34:52.900 --> 00:34:57.900
think that I've already gotten
some push back from economists

00:34:57.900 --> 00:35:02.630
who-- whether they're
saying this because it's

00:35:02.630 --> 00:35:06.710
sort of a fundamental position
that capitalism must include

00:35:06.710 --> 00:35:10.880
free wage labor, must be based
on free wage labor or not.

00:35:10.880 --> 00:35:13.960
But they're arguing
that, in fact,

00:35:13.960 --> 00:35:18.420
the contribution of
enslaved people's labor

00:35:18.420 --> 00:35:23.030
to the development of
capitalism is not so significant

00:35:23.030 --> 00:35:25.150
as I make it out to be.

00:35:25.150 --> 00:35:27.730
One point in particular
where there's

00:35:27.730 --> 00:35:29.780
some debate and
some divergence is,

00:35:29.780 --> 00:35:31.850
what is the cause of
that massive increase

00:35:31.850 --> 00:35:33.710
in productivity
that I mentioned?

00:35:33.710 --> 00:35:37.550
Productivity, of
course, is defined here

00:35:37.550 --> 00:35:40.750
as the quantity of labor--
or the quantity of output,

00:35:40.750 --> 00:35:42.350
I should say-- the
quantity of output

00:35:42.350 --> 00:35:44.820
generated in a given
amount of time.

00:35:44.820 --> 00:35:49.410
So the number of pounds picked
in a day by one laborer.

00:35:49.410 --> 00:35:52.250
And some economists argue
that the source of that

00:35:52.250 --> 00:35:56.600
is improved cotton seeds, and
that this produces a bigger

00:35:56.600 --> 00:35:59.580
yield of more pickable cotton.

00:35:59.580 --> 00:36:02.900
And I would argue, and
I say this in the book,

00:36:02.900 --> 00:36:04.560
that that is
definitely part of it,

00:36:04.560 --> 00:36:07.370
but somebody still has
to pick the cotton.

00:36:07.370 --> 00:36:11.410
There's more cotton out there,
and it's easier to pick.

00:36:11.410 --> 00:36:15.570
It's probably not four
times easier to pick.

00:36:15.570 --> 00:36:17.130
There's still a lot
of moving, a lot

00:36:17.130 --> 00:36:19.830
of grabbing, a lot of pulling.

00:36:19.830 --> 00:36:22.150
And, in fact, slave
owners also seem

00:36:22.150 --> 00:36:25.010
to think that it's not the seed
that they need to focus on,

00:36:25.010 --> 00:36:28.520
but it's actually extracting
the labor from individuals.

00:36:28.520 --> 00:36:32.950
So every day, and this goes
back to the description

00:36:32.950 --> 00:36:35.580
of the sort of calibrated
system that I mentioned

00:36:35.580 --> 00:36:38.300
before, every day
they're weighing.

00:36:38.300 --> 00:36:41.660
Every day they're recording
the amount of weighed.

00:36:41.660 --> 00:36:45.430
And every day, if you listen
to what formally enslaved

00:36:45.430 --> 00:36:48.360
people say, they're whipping
those who come up short.

00:36:48.360 --> 00:36:50.580
And this is a big
complicated system

00:36:50.580 --> 00:36:54.610
to put in place if what's really
making a difference is seeds.

00:36:54.610 --> 00:36:58.690
Enslavers really believe that
it is the pushing, the weighing,

00:36:58.690 --> 00:37:01.610
the whipping that is making
the difference in output

00:37:01.610 --> 00:37:05.550
and increasing
productivity over time.

00:37:05.550 --> 00:37:08.620
But you don't know
that if you don't

00:37:08.620 --> 00:37:12.200
look at what formally
enslaved people say.

00:37:12.200 --> 00:37:15.310
If you just look at what
the owners are saying,

00:37:15.310 --> 00:37:17.810
you just look at output--
and some economists

00:37:17.810 --> 00:37:20.170
have had a tendency--
then you don't really

00:37:20.170 --> 00:37:23.740
understand what the labor
system is like from the inside,

00:37:23.740 --> 00:37:26.210
from the perspective of
those who experienced it.

00:37:28.799 --> 00:37:30.590
AUDIENCE: I'm curious
when you started out,

00:37:30.590 --> 00:37:36.140
what was your aspiration,
what did you have in mind?

00:37:36.140 --> 00:37:37.820
Do you feel like
you achieved that,

00:37:37.820 --> 00:37:41.900
and where would
you go from here?

00:37:41.900 --> 00:37:45.140
EDWARD BAPTIST: So
that's a good question.

00:37:45.140 --> 00:37:47.820
Yeah, it was a while
ago when I started

00:37:47.820 --> 00:37:49.970
really working on this project.

00:37:49.970 --> 00:37:54.440
Google was one of
many search engines.

00:37:54.440 --> 00:37:58.320
I wasn't familiar with Google
Maps, it might have existed.

00:37:58.320 --> 00:38:00.810
One of my students
was trying to convince

00:38:00.810 --> 00:38:05.350
me to use a search
engine called "Dog Pile."

00:38:05.350 --> 00:38:07.370
I don't think, I
mean, maybe that's

00:38:07.370 --> 00:38:10.350
still out there on the way
back machine or something.

00:38:10.350 --> 00:38:14.030
But it was a long time ago.

00:38:14.030 --> 00:38:16.040
And the project
really grew over time

00:38:16.040 --> 00:38:22.080
because I wanted to look just
at the experience of people

00:38:22.080 --> 00:38:23.200
like Charles Ball.

00:38:23.200 --> 00:38:26.030
And I just wanted to tell their
story of moving from point A

00:38:26.030 --> 00:38:28.860
to point B. But,
as I dug into that,

00:38:28.860 --> 00:38:30.410
I realized that
that was connected

00:38:30.410 --> 00:38:33.760
to virtually everything else
that happened in the South

00:38:33.760 --> 00:38:37.970
from 1790 to 1860,
which is a long time.

00:38:37.970 --> 00:38:40.640
And everything that happened
there, it turned out,

00:38:40.640 --> 00:38:44.820
was connected to US
politics, national expansion,

00:38:44.820 --> 00:38:49.140
to the growing cultural
sense of the United States--

00:38:49.140 --> 00:38:52.420
with a separate culture
that people like John Palfry

00:38:52.420 --> 00:38:53.660
were a part of.

00:38:53.660 --> 00:38:56.240
There were many, many
connections, of course.

00:38:56.240 --> 00:38:58.370
That's a wonderful thing.

00:38:58.370 --> 00:39:03.160
That's a kind of experience of
wealth and excitement, right?

00:39:03.160 --> 00:39:07.300
You're seeing all of the
connections in the world.

00:39:07.300 --> 00:39:10.440
And, at the same time, you have
tell a story behind two covers,

00:39:10.440 --> 00:39:10.940
right?

00:39:10.940 --> 00:39:13.290
And has some kind of
coherent structure.

00:39:13.290 --> 00:39:18.300
So that was the struggle that I
went through-- not just reading

00:39:18.300 --> 00:39:20.050
all the sources, of
which there were many,

00:39:20.050 --> 00:39:25.920
but figuring out how to not
read some sources, if you will,

00:39:25.920 --> 00:39:29.180
that maybe in some
alternate universe where

00:39:29.180 --> 00:39:31.080
I have infinite
time could be part

00:39:31.080 --> 00:39:34.320
of an infinitely large story.

00:39:34.320 --> 00:39:35.985
So what's next?

00:39:35.985 --> 00:39:38.010
I have a couple of projects
that I'm working on,

00:39:38.010 --> 00:39:41.247
but, I think-- I was talking
to a couple friends of mine.

00:39:41.247 --> 00:39:43.080
I said, well I'm going
to go talk to Google.

00:39:43.080 --> 00:39:46.010
And they said, well,
maybe you don't

00:39:46.010 --> 00:39:49.150
say capitalism
comes from slavery.

00:39:49.150 --> 00:39:51.740
And I said, well, I don't know.

00:39:51.740 --> 00:39:55.630
I'm not quite sure
what people at Google

00:39:55.630 --> 00:39:58.156
think about those
kinds of questions

00:39:58.156 --> 00:39:59.280
so I'll just talk about it.

00:39:59.280 --> 00:40:02.430
But, they did urged me to
talk about another project

00:40:02.430 --> 00:40:05.160
I'm working on
because it directly

00:40:05.160 --> 00:40:09.440
connects the amazing
digital tools that we all

00:40:09.440 --> 00:40:12.460
have now to the study history.

00:40:12.460 --> 00:40:14.920
So one of the things that
when I was doing research

00:40:14.920 --> 00:40:17.530
on this project I always
wanted to have, one of things

00:40:17.530 --> 00:40:19.920
always wanted to
have was a collection

00:40:19.920 --> 00:40:22.850
of runaway slave ads,
a full collection.

00:40:22.850 --> 00:40:24.980
I don't know if you've
ever seen these things,

00:40:24.980 --> 00:40:28.440
if you've read Frederick
Douglass's autobiography,

00:40:28.440 --> 00:40:30.030
he discusses them.

00:40:30.030 --> 00:40:33.090
Other fugitive slaves
talk about them.

00:40:33.090 --> 00:40:36.220
Even "Huckelberry Finn" sort of
tangentially talks about them.

00:40:36.220 --> 00:40:41.120
So when an enslaved person ran
away in the antebellum South,

00:40:41.120 --> 00:40:46.600
often the owner would place
an ad in a local newspaper.

00:40:46.600 --> 00:40:50.210
And this ad was very
frank in many cases,

00:40:50.210 --> 00:40:54.120
because it had to physically
describe the person.

00:40:54.120 --> 00:41:00.070
So, Jim-- five foot
nine, 27 years old.

00:41:00.070 --> 00:41:02.490
That description
not only is richer

00:41:02.490 --> 00:41:04.410
than a lot of the
description we have

00:41:04.410 --> 00:41:07.820
in any sort of systematic way
about large numbers of slaves,

00:41:07.820 --> 00:41:10.640
but it might then
also go on to say,

00:41:10.640 --> 00:41:16.540
Jim-- three of whose fingers
on his right hand were cut off,

00:41:16.540 --> 00:41:19.490
whose back is much scarred with
whips, et cetera, et cetera.

00:41:19.490 --> 00:41:22.600
And it might describe their
clothes, where they came from.

00:41:22.600 --> 00:41:26.510
Jim was just moved from South
Carolina to Alabama a year ago,

00:41:26.510 --> 00:41:27.930
may be trying to get back.

00:41:27.930 --> 00:41:28.650
Things like that.

00:41:28.650 --> 00:41:30.630
So there's amazing
detail and there

00:41:30.630 --> 00:41:33.940
are amazingly large
numbers of the sources.

00:41:33.940 --> 00:41:37.780
My vague estimate is that there
are probably about 100,000

00:41:37.780 --> 00:41:40.070
of them out there
in newspapers that

00:41:40.070 --> 00:41:43.100
survived, because
the early 1800s is

00:41:43.100 --> 00:41:46.330
the era of another new
technology-- the steam

00:41:46.330 --> 00:41:47.970
powered press.

00:41:47.970 --> 00:41:50.960
And newspapers proliferate.

00:41:50.960 --> 00:41:54.490
They stop being weeklies and
become two or three times

00:41:54.490 --> 00:41:56.600
a week, and they become dailies.

00:41:56.600 --> 00:41:58.450
Newspapers are everywhere.

00:41:58.450 --> 00:42:01.670
And runaway ads are in
most of the Southern ones.

00:42:01.670 --> 00:42:05.000
So my mind guesstimate is
that there are about 100,000.

00:42:05.000 --> 00:42:08.320
I don't think I'm off by a
whole order of magnitude.

00:42:08.320 --> 00:42:10.170
I know not on the
low end, anyway.

00:42:10.170 --> 00:42:14.020
We already have gathered
over 10,000 of them.

00:42:14.020 --> 00:42:16.030
But what I want
to do is not just

00:42:16.030 --> 00:42:19.830
gather them and put
them in digital form--

00:42:19.830 --> 00:42:22.310
collect them as a
whole bunch of PDFs--

00:42:22.310 --> 00:42:24.550
but, what I also
want to do is create

00:42:24.550 --> 00:42:29.810
a database that categorizes
the information.

00:42:29.810 --> 00:42:32.010
And we're going to use
a relational database

00:42:32.010 --> 00:42:35.270
as sort of an underlying
structure there-- categorizes

00:42:35.270 --> 00:42:38.340
the information
that's in those ads.

00:42:38.340 --> 00:42:41.170
The name, the height,
where they ran from,

00:42:41.170 --> 00:42:43.560
how many times this
ad ran, and so on.

00:42:43.560 --> 00:42:45.990
So that you can do all kinds
of interesting analysis.

00:42:45.990 --> 00:42:49.055
And we will also record all
the text, which will allow us,

00:42:49.055 --> 00:42:50.430
hopefully, if we
get enough text,

00:42:50.430 --> 00:42:53.620
to do some very interesting
text mining with it.

00:42:53.620 --> 00:42:55.316
And, in fact, one of
the people that I'm

00:42:55.316 --> 00:42:56.690
working with at
Cornell's library

00:42:56.690 --> 00:43:01.430
wants to run-- this has probably
already occurred to a lot you--

00:43:01.430 --> 00:43:06.000
but basically the
same kind of analysis

00:43:06.000 --> 00:43:08.750
with a relational database
as with the text mining,

00:43:08.750 --> 00:43:12.040
and see if you've got radically
different kinds of results--

00:43:12.040 --> 00:43:16.930
see if the difference might tell
you anything about the ability

00:43:16.930 --> 00:43:19.200
or the usefulness of
different text mining tools

00:43:19.200 --> 00:43:20.962
and techniques.

00:43:20.962 --> 00:43:22.670
And then the other
piece of this database

00:43:22.670 --> 00:43:26.290
is that I want a large part
of it to be crowdsourced.

00:43:26.290 --> 00:43:29.400
So we're building a
site where hopefully,

00:43:29.400 --> 00:43:33.130
if we continue to get funding
over the next couple of years,

00:43:33.130 --> 00:43:35.740
we'll be able to create
an experience for users--

00:43:35.740 --> 00:43:38.700
students, in particular,
are one of our targets--

00:43:38.700 --> 00:43:42.600
where they will go
to the site and then

00:43:42.600 --> 00:43:45.040
be presented with
a runaway slave ad,

00:43:45.040 --> 00:43:48.430
and their job will be to do
the detective work of pulling

00:43:48.430 --> 00:43:51.890
information out of
that ad, recording it

00:43:51.890 --> 00:43:54.400
for us in the
relational database,

00:43:54.400 --> 00:43:57.740
maybe correcting a
transcription of the text.

00:43:57.740 --> 00:44:02.170
And as they do that, they
will be building and deepening

00:44:02.170 --> 00:44:03.430
our database.

00:44:03.430 --> 00:44:05.360
And we think the kinds
of historical analysis

00:44:05.360 --> 00:44:11.180
we can do with this will
be significantly more

00:44:11.180 --> 00:44:13.910
effective and more interesting
than a lot of the work we've

00:44:13.910 --> 00:44:16.670
been able to do so far
in slavery studies.

00:44:16.670 --> 00:44:20.270
So that's the next project.

00:44:20.270 --> 00:44:22.160
AUDIENCE: That's
pretty interesting.

00:44:22.160 --> 00:44:25.890
I have a question that's on
a different subject though.

00:44:25.890 --> 00:44:30.710
I'm wondering if you've done
much comparative analysis

00:44:30.710 --> 00:44:33.270
of slavery in the South
with slavery elsewhere.

00:44:33.270 --> 00:44:35.700
I'm thinking, in
particular, of, I guess,

00:44:35.700 --> 00:44:37.780
the two most obvious
examples would

00:44:37.780 --> 00:44:41.930
be the slavery in the
Caribbean for the purpose

00:44:41.930 --> 00:44:47.460
of harvesting sugar and
also the slavery of Indians,

00:44:47.460 --> 00:44:52.610
in particular, say Peru
earlier by the Spanish, too,

00:44:52.610 --> 00:44:55.900
for mainly for the
purpose of mining--

00:44:55.900 --> 00:44:59.240
those, in particular the Spanish
system, seems pretty different.

00:44:59.240 --> 00:45:01.560
Also seems, pretty
clearly, not too

00:45:01.560 --> 00:45:05.030
have led to any sort of
industrial capitalism at all.

00:45:05.030 --> 00:45:09.190
I guess, for the British
system in the West Indies,

00:45:09.190 --> 00:45:11.550
you'll probably have to
look at how that related

00:45:11.550 --> 00:45:14.250
to industrialization
in Britain more,

00:45:14.250 --> 00:45:17.070
and I know there's a lot of
literature on that already.

00:45:17.070 --> 00:45:19.840
But, anyway, I'm just
wondering, just in general,

00:45:19.840 --> 00:45:21.760
do these kind of
comparisons tell you

00:45:21.760 --> 00:45:23.330
anything about your own theory?

00:45:23.330 --> 00:45:24.170
Do they support it?

00:45:24.170 --> 00:45:28.231
Do they tend to not support it?

00:45:28.231 --> 00:45:29.230
how do you look at that?

00:45:29.230 --> 00:45:31.840
EDWARD BAPTIST: Now
that's a great question.

00:45:31.840 --> 00:45:36.450
And I don't know so much about
the systems of forced labor

00:45:36.450 --> 00:45:41.070
that are used on native
peoples in the Andes,

00:45:41.070 --> 00:45:43.190
for instance, to get silver.

00:45:43.190 --> 00:45:46.550
But, my basic understanding
is that they're not,

00:45:46.550 --> 00:45:49.240
strictly speaking,
chattel slavery.

00:45:49.240 --> 00:45:52.800
That they're sort of labor
requisition processes.

00:45:52.800 --> 00:45:55.630
The difference If you were
working in the silver mine

00:45:55.630 --> 00:45:59.720
might have been pretty hard,
you know, to parse out.

00:45:59.720 --> 00:46:03.150
And there were African slaves
working in Peru, sometimes

00:46:03.150 --> 00:46:08.190
in the mines, in a sort of more
chattel slavery formulation.

00:46:08.190 --> 00:46:12.850
Slavery in the British West
Indies, which ends in 1834,

00:46:12.850 --> 00:46:18.910
is already, I would say,
moribund by the early 1800s.

00:46:18.910 --> 00:46:21.450
And one reason is
that the productivity

00:46:21.450 --> 00:46:23.870
of sugar production
is not increasing.

00:46:23.870 --> 00:46:25.980
It hasn't increased in a while.

00:46:25.980 --> 00:46:30.120
And there's always been a
sort of a historical problem

00:46:30.120 --> 00:46:31.900
or debate about why that is.

00:46:31.900 --> 00:46:34.170
Does it have to be
do with labor supply?

00:46:34.170 --> 00:46:39.160
The Atlantic slave trade is
cut off in 1808 by Parliament.

00:46:39.160 --> 00:46:43.550
Maybe it's easier
to force Africans

00:46:43.550 --> 00:46:46.760
into harder kinds of
labor because they're not

00:46:46.760 --> 00:46:49.440
able to build the
kind of networks that

00:46:49.440 --> 00:46:52.590
allow group and individual
resistance to locally born

00:46:52.590 --> 00:46:54.480
enslaved people.

00:46:54.480 --> 00:46:56.990
There are a lot of
questions still about that.

00:46:56.990 --> 00:47:01.030
But, one thing's for
sure, both the mechanics

00:47:01.030 --> 00:47:08.610
of sugar processing and
the way that sugar labor

00:47:08.610 --> 00:47:11.210
is extracted from
individuals are

00:47:11.210 --> 00:47:16.010
different in Cuba in the 19th
century than what prevailed

00:47:16.010 --> 00:47:20.710
in Britain and some other
colonies in the 18th century.

00:47:20.710 --> 00:47:24.380
So new machinery comes in,
and sugar is, mechanically

00:47:24.380 --> 00:47:29.950
speaking, the most complex
of any commodity production

00:47:29.950 --> 00:47:33.930
process before--
I mean, you could

00:47:33.930 --> 00:47:36.430
argue it's actually more complex
than the Bessemer process

00:47:36.430 --> 00:47:40.390
for making steel--
but it's more complex

00:47:40.390 --> 00:47:43.660
than any sort of
chemical process--

00:47:43.660 --> 00:47:48.270
so its any non medical
process-- than anything

00:47:48.270 --> 00:47:50.300
that happens before
the late 19th century.

00:47:50.300 --> 00:47:55.720
It's very important for sugar
slavers to have a lot of credit

00:47:55.720 --> 00:47:58.640
so that they can invest
in this kind of machinery,

00:47:58.640 --> 00:48:00.939
and the kind of machinery
they have is very important.

00:48:00.939 --> 00:48:02.980
Well, they're lot of key
inventions in the 1810s,

00:48:02.980 --> 00:48:06.080
'20s and '30s which
allow a speedup

00:48:06.080 --> 00:48:07.420
in the processing of sugar.

00:48:07.420 --> 00:48:11.790
This is significant because
there's kind of a bottleneck--

00:48:11.790 --> 00:48:17.810
if you don't mill sugar, if you
don't then refine the juice you

00:48:17.810 --> 00:48:21.080
get from the mill within
about 24 to 48 hours

00:48:21.080 --> 00:48:22.840
it starts to go bad.

00:48:22.840 --> 00:48:27.420
So unless you have
many, many sugar mills,

00:48:27.420 --> 00:48:30.890
there's a limit to how
much labor you can actually

00:48:30.890 --> 00:48:34.430
profitably use on
one sugar plantation.

00:48:34.430 --> 00:48:38.730
The change that's driven by
these mechanical, technological

00:48:38.730 --> 00:48:42.180
innovations leads to
a dramatic increase

00:48:42.180 --> 00:48:47.870
in the size of sugar plantations
once they're created on Cuba.

00:48:47.870 --> 00:48:50.920
And that primarily begins
to happen after 1834,

00:48:50.920 --> 00:48:52.830
after the British emancipation.

00:48:52.830 --> 00:48:55.530
So in Cuba, the sugar
plantations get much bigger,

00:48:55.530 --> 00:48:59.770
get much more sped up, and labor
is then behind the processing.

00:48:59.770 --> 00:49:01.990
So labor in the fields
is slower than what's

00:49:01.990 --> 00:49:04.100
happening in the
processing centers.

00:49:04.100 --> 00:49:06.720
So labor in the fields
is then sped up,

00:49:06.720 --> 00:49:08.910
and they actually,
the enslavers is Cuba,

00:49:08.910 --> 00:49:10.955
actually use some
techniques that

00:49:10.955 --> 00:49:13.270
are very similar to what
happens in cotton fields

00:49:13.270 --> 00:49:16.760
to get people to plant,
and to cut, and to harvest

00:49:16.760 --> 00:49:17.910
more rapidly.

00:49:17.910 --> 00:49:19.410
And at the same
time, similar things

00:49:19.410 --> 00:49:21.800
are happening in
Brazilian coffee

00:49:21.800 --> 00:49:25.440
where you have a massive
increase in production

00:49:25.440 --> 00:49:27.840
in new territory, often
with new slaves who

00:49:27.840 --> 00:49:29.340
had been moved a
very long way away.

00:49:29.340 --> 00:49:31.040
It's very similar to cotton.

00:49:31.040 --> 00:49:35.880
And the weighing and the
recording of how much slaves

00:49:35.880 --> 00:49:39.010
individual slaves have picked in
terms of weight of coffee beans

00:49:39.010 --> 00:49:42.270
is very important to pushing
an increase in production.

00:49:42.270 --> 00:49:44.920
It might seem like
coffee's not really related

00:49:44.920 --> 00:49:48.700
to industrialization,
but I bet I can walk you

00:49:48.700 --> 00:49:51.210
through that process really
quickly when you think

00:49:51.210 --> 00:49:54.690
about the espresso
machine, right?

00:49:54.690 --> 00:49:56.940
I mean, I'm serious.

00:49:56.940 --> 00:49:59.250
The transition from
drinking alcohol at work

00:49:59.250 --> 00:50:03.060
to drinking coffee work is key
to industrialization as well.

00:50:06.490 --> 00:50:10.670
So the Jamaican
example, for instance,

00:50:10.670 --> 00:50:14.060
is a little-- it
fits into a longer

00:50:14.060 --> 00:50:16.030
story of slavery and
industrialization.

00:50:16.030 --> 00:50:20.052
It's bigger than just the USA.

00:50:20.052 --> 00:50:22.130
AUDIENCE: I've got a
couple more questions.

00:50:22.130 --> 00:50:25.650
First, on the topic
of not being evil,

00:50:25.650 --> 00:50:27.410
you suggested--
what you're saying--

00:50:27.410 --> 00:50:32.910
I'm sure, what you written--
that in the early 1800s if you

00:50:32.910 --> 00:50:35.897
were opposed to slavery,
it would have been very

00:50:35.897 --> 00:50:37.730
difficult in the US,
and maybe in the world,

00:50:37.730 --> 00:50:39.970
to unplug from the slave
economy from the economics

00:50:39.970 --> 00:50:41.660
effects of it.

00:50:41.660 --> 00:50:45.610
Can you think of examples,
other than the Civil War itself,

00:50:45.610 --> 00:50:48.370
of course, that were
effective at that time

00:50:48.370 --> 00:50:50.764
in bringing an end
to slavery in the US.

00:50:50.764 --> 00:50:52.430
Particularly, things
that were effective

00:50:52.430 --> 00:50:53.949
on an economical level.

00:50:53.949 --> 00:50:55.990
And then, my second
question, is can you actually

00:50:55.990 --> 00:50:58.770
talk about "The Economist"
review, the response to that,

00:50:58.770 --> 00:51:01.437
and so forth?

00:51:01.437 --> 00:51:03.520
EDWARD BAPTIST: I can try
to answer both of those,

00:51:03.520 --> 00:51:06.970
but when you ask effective
at ending slavery in the US,

00:51:06.970 --> 00:51:10.475
do you mean in, let's say
local emancipation-- like what

00:51:10.475 --> 00:51:11.850
you have in the
Northern states--

00:51:11.850 --> 00:51:15.090
or do you mean effective
in ending slavery

00:51:15.090 --> 00:51:19.670
in other societies
beyond the US?

00:51:19.670 --> 00:51:23.060
AUDIENCE: Well, I
think both in a sense,

00:51:23.060 --> 00:51:27.130
in that if what
you found offensive

00:51:27.130 --> 00:51:29.350
was the act of slavery
itself and it was

00:51:29.350 --> 00:51:32.449
offensive in your
country and elsewhere.

00:51:32.449 --> 00:51:33.240
EDWARD BAPTIST: OK.

00:51:35.860 --> 00:51:39.780
So explaining abolition
and explaining

00:51:39.780 --> 00:51:43.690
why the British abolished
slavery has launched

00:51:43.690 --> 00:51:46.007
all sorts of history
books, right?

00:51:46.007 --> 00:51:47.840
It's spilled a lot of
ink, and there's still

00:51:47.840 --> 00:51:49.430
a lot of debate about that.

00:51:49.430 --> 00:51:51.410
And there's two points of view.

00:51:51.410 --> 00:51:55.950
One is that it was an act
of what one historian calls,

00:51:55.950 --> 00:51:57.470
"econocide," right?

00:51:57.470 --> 00:52:02.090
So it was economically
very healthy for Britain

00:52:02.090 --> 00:52:05.240
to have sugar
plantation colonies

00:52:05.240 --> 00:52:07.250
where the labor
was done by slaves,

00:52:07.250 --> 00:52:13.240
and they abolished slavery as
a sort of act of generosity,

00:52:13.240 --> 00:52:15.400
of moral goodness, if you will.

00:52:15.400 --> 00:52:18.170
And you can nuance that and
say, well they weren't really

00:52:18.170 --> 00:52:19.120
so good after all.

00:52:19.120 --> 00:52:21.150
They actually were hoping
for something else,

00:52:21.150 --> 00:52:23.780
but that's the essential point.

00:52:23.780 --> 00:52:28.080
The other is to argue-- and
this goes all the way back

00:52:28.080 --> 00:52:30.430
certainly to the
1940s, but maybe

00:52:30.430 --> 00:52:34.510
even before-- to argue
that capitalism in Britain

00:52:34.510 --> 00:52:38.110
was changing dramatically
by the early 1800s,

00:52:38.110 --> 00:52:41.110
as evidenced by the
Industrial Revolution.

00:52:41.110 --> 00:52:45.650
And a heavy investment in the
slave trade, in Atlantic slave

00:52:45.650 --> 00:52:48.950
trade-- it was necessary to
populate sugar plantations

00:52:48.950 --> 00:52:51.210
because people died
at an astonishing rate

00:52:51.210 --> 00:52:52.800
on sugar plantation,
so you had to go

00:52:52.800 --> 00:52:57.230
more slaves-- and
the investments

00:52:57.230 --> 00:52:59.950
in the sort of
institutional power,

00:52:59.950 --> 00:53:02.060
that you had the seed
to sugar planters.

00:53:02.060 --> 00:53:05.760
That this was a limiting
force, a sort of parking

00:53:05.760 --> 00:53:09.700
brake on the development
of industrial capitalism

00:53:09.700 --> 00:53:11.070
in Britain itself.

00:53:11.070 --> 00:53:13.470
And so it's not an
act of econocide,

00:53:13.470 --> 00:53:15.680
it's an act of
economic self love

00:53:15.680 --> 00:53:18.200
on the part of the
British ruling class

00:53:18.200 --> 00:53:19.595
to abolish slavery.

00:53:19.595 --> 00:53:23.220
The story, I think, is--
there's a little bit of both,

00:53:23.220 --> 00:53:28.740
and it's much more
complicated at the same time.

00:53:28.740 --> 00:53:33.360
If you look at other societies,
what you typically find

00:53:33.360 --> 00:53:35.140
is that they abolish
slavery because they

00:53:35.140 --> 00:53:38.270
had to, because they
were forced to do so.

00:53:38.270 --> 00:53:43.920
So African countries,
or African societies,

00:53:43.920 --> 00:53:47.530
where slavery actually
grows in the 1800s

00:53:47.530 --> 00:53:50.890
because the European market for
the products those slaves make

00:53:50.890 --> 00:53:53.660
is all of a sudden getting
much larger because

00:53:53.660 --> 00:53:58.200
of industrialization-- those
societies only abolish slavery

00:53:58.200 --> 00:54:00.710
in the late 19th century
because they're forced to.

00:54:00.710 --> 00:54:03.930
They're forced to by the
British, in particular.

00:54:03.930 --> 00:54:07.650
Brazil abolishes
slavery very late, 1888,

00:54:07.650 --> 00:54:10.160
and it does so because
it's been effectively

00:54:10.160 --> 00:54:14.920
isolated-- it's been isolated
by the fall of the South--

00:54:14.920 --> 00:54:18.390
and pressure from its main
trading partners, Britain

00:54:18.390 --> 00:54:20.010
and the US.

00:54:20.010 --> 00:54:23.030
And, at the same
time, Brazil also

00:54:23.030 --> 00:54:27.450
has sort of lucked into a
really, really good stream

00:54:27.450 --> 00:54:32.410
of labor coming in the form of
essentially indentured servants

00:54:32.410 --> 00:54:36.110
who are traveling from Italy--
Italy which is, at that point,

00:54:36.110 --> 00:54:37.410
impoverished.

00:54:37.410 --> 00:54:45.090
So they don't completely have to
at that point, they're not 100%

00:54:45.090 --> 00:54:49.120
backed into it, but there's
some pretty strong incentives,

00:54:49.120 --> 00:54:51.730
pretty strong pressures,
being put on them.

00:54:51.730 --> 00:54:55.490
And then, of course, in
the case the US, slavery

00:54:55.490 --> 00:54:57.740
ends because of war--
and a war that's

00:54:57.740 --> 00:54:59.580
started by enslavers themselves.

00:54:59.580 --> 00:55:03.000
Now, one question
that always comes up

00:55:03.000 --> 00:55:07.560
is, well, would slavery have
ended without the Civil War?

00:55:07.560 --> 00:55:10.860
And, on that point,
people who have

00:55:10.860 --> 00:55:14.600
tried to answer that question
often say, well, of course.

00:55:14.600 --> 00:55:15.720
Slavery would've ended.

00:55:15.720 --> 00:55:19.610
It's just so premodern,
it would have had to end.

00:55:19.610 --> 00:55:22.194
Well, it's 2014 and there
are slaves in our world.

00:55:22.194 --> 00:55:23.610
There are people
who are enslaved.

00:55:23.610 --> 00:55:25.443
There are people who
are enslaved in Boston.

00:55:25.443 --> 00:55:27.680
They're not legally enslaved,
but they're effectively

00:55:27.680 --> 00:55:28.440
enslaved.

00:55:28.440 --> 00:55:31.640
And their labor, which is
primarily domestic labor,

00:55:31.640 --> 00:55:32.810
is very profitable.

00:55:32.810 --> 00:55:34.940
And then when you go
beyond the United States

00:55:34.940 --> 00:55:37.060
and beyond the West,
you find places

00:55:37.060 --> 00:55:42.170
where forced labor is pretty
open-- in parts of Africa,

00:55:42.170 --> 00:55:43.860
and Central Asia, and so on.

00:55:43.860 --> 00:55:50.590
So, I'm not ready to concede
that slavery would have simply

00:55:50.590 --> 00:55:53.400
had to end because it was
so premodern, or whatever.

00:55:53.400 --> 00:55:55.300
It seemed to be
pretty well integrated

00:55:55.300 --> 00:55:57.080
into the modern economy.

00:55:57.080 --> 00:55:59.750
Maybe after the invention
of mechanical cotton picker

00:55:59.750 --> 00:56:01.650
we would've seen
an end to slavery,

00:56:01.650 --> 00:56:03.330
but, of course, slavery
had been adapted

00:56:03.330 --> 00:56:06.470
to a new product in the past.

00:56:06.470 --> 00:56:12.550
Now, alright, "The Economist."

00:56:12.550 --> 00:56:14.970
I learned that "The
Economist" would

00:56:14.970 --> 00:56:17.780
be reviewing my book
a couple weeks ago,

00:56:17.780 --> 00:56:21.680
and I didn't anticipate
that it would be a rave.

00:56:21.680 --> 00:56:25.180
But I anticipated it would be a
kind of a thoughtful engagement

00:56:25.180 --> 00:56:29.470
that looked at the recent
scholarship as well as mine,

00:56:29.470 --> 00:56:33.220
and tried to put my book
in the context of that.

00:56:33.220 --> 00:56:35.790
That's, for instance, what
"The Wall Street Journal" did

00:56:35.790 --> 00:56:37.170
and it reviewed-- it
came out this week.

00:56:37.170 --> 00:56:39.260
And it put my book in the
context of other people

00:56:39.260 --> 00:56:40.660
who are writing about
slavery and capitalism,

00:56:40.660 --> 00:56:43.030
like Walter Johnson here
at Harvard-- here in town

00:56:43.030 --> 00:56:46.180
at Harvard-- who's written
a great book, essentially,

00:56:46.180 --> 00:56:50.100
on slavery capitalism--
came out last year.

00:56:50.100 --> 00:56:52.560
That's not what "The
Economists" did.

00:56:52.560 --> 00:56:56.770
"The Economist"
chose to charge me

00:56:56.770 --> 00:57:02.380
with writing a history that
was advocacy and not objective.

00:57:02.380 --> 00:57:05.050
We could debate about what
objectivity in history is.

00:57:05.050 --> 00:57:07.670
I'm not sure what they
think I'm advocating,

00:57:07.670 --> 00:57:10.110
but-- if I'm
advocating anything--

00:57:10.110 --> 00:57:13.580
I think I'm advocating that
at the center of any story

00:57:13.580 --> 00:57:16.407
about slavery
should be sources--

00:57:16.407 --> 00:57:17.990
and we're lucky in
the US that they're

00:57:17.990 --> 00:57:23.460
pretty voluminous-- these
sources that are created

00:57:23.460 --> 00:57:25.100
by the survivors
of slavery, that

00:57:25.100 --> 00:57:27.370
are the testimony of the
survivors of slavery.

00:57:27.370 --> 00:57:29.453
It doesn't mean that's the
only source we look at.

00:57:29.453 --> 00:57:31.350
It's not the only
source I look at,

00:57:31.350 --> 00:57:33.610
but it's a source that
can't be dismissed,

00:57:33.610 --> 00:57:36.570
and too often, in the
writing of slavery history,

00:57:36.570 --> 00:57:39.880
has been pushed to the
side and made secondary.

00:57:39.880 --> 00:57:44.690
And this-- if I can read "The
Economist" review correctly--

00:57:44.690 --> 00:57:49.660
seemed to be the thing that
enraged the reviewer the most.

00:57:49.660 --> 00:57:52.260
I seemed, to their
mind, to be privileging

00:57:52.260 --> 00:57:55.600
those stories, and
that, because I

00:57:55.600 --> 00:57:59.860
put African American
testimony about slavery

00:57:59.860 --> 00:58:03.395
at the center of the story,
that made it a kind of advocacy.

00:58:06.950 --> 00:58:14.610
I also think that's the sort
of chain of criticisms that

00:58:14.610 --> 00:58:19.030
enraged a lot of
respondents to the review,

00:58:19.030 --> 00:58:26.640
because I got the review on
Thursday-- about one or two

00:58:26.640 --> 00:58:32.660
o'clock Eastern time-- and
by late that night, I think,

00:58:32.660 --> 00:58:37.180
we were five full pages of
comments on "The Economist"

00:58:37.180 --> 00:58:39.560
site, and every single
one of them that I saw

00:58:39.560 --> 00:58:42.920
was profoundly negative.

00:58:42.920 --> 00:58:48.680
And some of them were quite
incisive and quite smart

00:58:48.680 --> 00:58:50.460
and by the next
morning, "The Economist"

00:58:50.460 --> 00:58:56.130
had pulled the review
with a partial apology.

00:58:56.130 --> 00:58:58.940
I could say some things
about how they used the image

00:58:58.940 --> 00:59:00.990
of Lupita Nyong'o,
which, I think,

00:59:00.990 --> 00:59:03.920
was pretty reprehensible,
the way that they did it.

00:59:03.920 --> 00:59:06.880
And they haven't
apologize for that either.

00:59:06.880 --> 00:59:12.880
But it turned out to
be great publicity

00:59:12.880 --> 00:59:16.280
for any discussion of
capitalism and slavery.

00:59:16.280 --> 00:59:21.070
I mean, I got-- the phone
was ringing off the hook.

00:59:21.070 --> 00:59:23.890
They sold a lot of
books, and I hope

00:59:23.890 --> 00:59:25.930
they sold a lot of other
books about slavery

00:59:25.930 --> 00:59:27.360
for some of my friends.

00:59:27.360 --> 00:59:30.160
And I hope people are going
to talk about these issues

00:59:30.160 --> 00:59:34.600
more, because, I think, the
reaction of "The Economist"

00:59:34.600 --> 00:59:39.370
showed that the issue is still
alive in a lot of quarters.

00:59:39.370 --> 00:59:44.870
And discussion of the influence
of slavery on how we live today

00:59:44.870 --> 00:59:48.750
is something that's going
to provoke some deep,

00:59:48.750 --> 00:59:51.066
searching questions, I
think, for all of us.

00:59:51.066 --> 00:59:53.190
So, hopefully, that's--
hopefully questions will be

00:59:53.190 --> 00:59:55.300
deepen and searching.

00:59:55.300 --> 00:59:57.460
Not everybody thought that
"The Economist" review

00:59:57.460 --> 00:59:59.609
was deep and searching.

00:59:59.609 --> 01:00:00.150
There you go.

01:00:04.740 --> 01:00:08.090
AUDIENCE: So I've been
reading Piketty's "Capitalism

01:00:08.090 --> 01:00:09.800
in the 21st Century."

01:00:09.800 --> 01:00:12.600
It strikes me that part
of Piketty's thesis

01:00:12.600 --> 01:00:17.090
is that capitalism seems to
be, under some circumstances,

01:00:17.090 --> 01:00:18.870
you produce greater
and greater wealth

01:00:18.870 --> 01:00:20.619
for a smaller and
smaller number of people

01:00:20.619 --> 01:00:24.090
and the working class ends up
getting poorer and poorer--

01:00:24.090 --> 01:00:26.560
at which point,
slavery kind of seems

01:00:26.560 --> 01:00:30.505
like the limiting case of that.

01:00:30.505 --> 01:00:32.005
I was trying to
formulate a question

01:00:32.005 --> 01:00:34.640
and I have failed
utterly, but any thoughts

01:00:34.640 --> 01:00:38.270
about how that pertains
to models of capitalism

01:00:38.270 --> 01:00:39.480
and how it evolves over time?

01:00:39.480 --> 01:00:44.210
EDWARD BAPTIST: Yeah,
I'm not sure if you

01:00:44.210 --> 01:00:47.260
fail to formulate
a question or not.

01:00:47.260 --> 01:00:50.320
I think what you did was
open up a whole area, right.

01:00:50.320 --> 01:00:52.820
Which is really,
really interesting.

01:00:52.820 --> 01:00:57.530
And I read-- I can claim
with full truthfulness

01:00:57.530 --> 01:00:59.630
to have slogged
through the whole book,

01:00:59.630 --> 01:01:01.610
but I wouldn't actually
say it was a slog.

01:01:01.610 --> 01:01:04.950
If you read-- if you get into,
like, the last 200 pages,

01:01:04.950 --> 01:01:07.880
he's got some really interesting
things to say about the US.

01:01:07.880 --> 01:01:14.010
And I'm pretty sure all of
we're pretty successful at US

01:01:14.010 --> 01:01:16.200
or other universities,
and there's

01:01:16.200 --> 01:01:17.830
some really interesting
things to say

01:01:17.830 --> 01:01:20.760
about the kinds of universities
that a lot of you all went to

01:01:20.760 --> 01:01:25.385
and that I teach at and
so on, which are rough.

01:01:25.385 --> 01:01:26.760
I mean, they are
rough criticisms

01:01:26.760 --> 01:01:29.010
and, I think, ones we
have to take seriously

01:01:29.010 --> 01:01:32.830
about the role of wealth and
governing them in certain ways.

01:01:32.830 --> 01:01:37.500
But anyway, I think one
of the points he makes

01:01:37.500 --> 01:01:40.560
is that most human
societies, and certainly

01:01:40.560 --> 01:01:45.130
most Western societies since
the Industrial Revolution,

01:01:45.130 --> 01:01:49.420
seem to be arenas for the
concentration of wealth

01:01:49.420 --> 01:01:52.330
rather than the
democratization of wealth.

01:01:52.330 --> 01:01:54.900
Yes, standards of
living on the whole

01:01:54.900 --> 01:01:59.100
rise, but they don't
rise nearly as quickly

01:01:59.100 --> 01:02:02.180
as they do in
those brief windows

01:02:02.180 --> 01:02:04.370
where the
democratisation of wealth

01:02:04.370 --> 01:02:07.020
is really sort of running wild.

01:02:07.020 --> 01:02:09.440
And there are really
only two moments

01:02:09.440 --> 01:02:11.440
where he sees that happening.

01:02:11.440 --> 01:02:16.310
One is most of the West
between World War II and 1968,

01:02:16.310 --> 01:02:21.090
or maybe between some point
the Great Depression and 1968.

01:02:21.090 --> 01:02:24.137
And the other-- and that's
sort of a high inflation

01:02:24.137 --> 01:02:25.720
period, which is
part of his argument,

01:02:25.720 --> 01:02:29.610
too-- but the other
one is the US North

01:02:29.610 --> 01:02:33.080
between the Revolution
and the Civil War.

01:02:33.080 --> 01:02:34.960
And that's also unusual.

01:02:34.960 --> 01:02:37.857
It's an unusual time and
place, just like the West

01:02:37.857 --> 01:02:39.690
as it goes through the
Depression, World War

01:02:39.690 --> 01:02:42.805
II, and then the Great Rebuild--
well at the same time you

01:02:42.805 --> 01:02:45.530
had this confrontation with
the Eastern Bloc, which

01:02:45.530 --> 01:02:48.470
is not incidental to the story.

01:02:48.470 --> 01:02:53.370
But the US North is also weird
because, on the one hand,

01:02:53.370 --> 01:02:56.260
it can draw a lot
of sustenance, I

01:02:56.260 --> 01:02:58.650
would argue, from
the slave South.

01:02:58.650 --> 01:03:03.900
It partakes in the
circulation of credit

01:03:03.900 --> 01:03:07.390
that is partly
driven by the South

01:03:07.390 --> 01:03:09.690
and by the willingness
of British investors,

01:03:09.690 --> 01:03:11.870
especially, to send
money into the US

01:03:11.870 --> 01:03:15.405
because it'll come back
multiplied through the cotton

01:03:15.405 --> 01:03:16.760
trade.

01:03:16.760 --> 01:03:22.950
But the North, of course,
isn't weighed down in the ways

01:03:22.950 --> 01:03:25.510
or isn't limited in the
ways that slavery clearly

01:03:25.510 --> 01:03:29.080
can limit and constrain
choices for an economy.

01:03:29.080 --> 01:03:31.280
And then, there's
all that cheap land.

01:03:31.280 --> 01:03:33.570
There's all that
free land, right?

01:03:33.570 --> 01:03:35.080
It's not really
free because it has

01:03:35.080 --> 01:03:37.610
to be taken from the people
who already live on it,

01:03:37.610 --> 01:03:38.770
but its there.

01:03:38.770 --> 01:03:40.460
So these are two
unusual cases, OK?

01:03:40.460 --> 01:03:42.876
So what does this mean for
thinking about the slave South?

01:03:42.876 --> 01:03:46.550
What it means is that the
slave South is more like 2014

01:03:46.550 --> 01:03:55.590
US, 2014 Western Europe, 1914
Europe than the free North is

01:03:55.590 --> 01:03:58.450
like those societies,
in some measures, right?

01:03:58.450 --> 01:03:59.200
In some ways.

01:03:59.200 --> 01:04:02.140
Certainly when we look at the
way wealth is concentrated.

01:04:02.140 --> 01:04:04.520
The profile of the
South is much more

01:04:04.520 --> 01:04:10.560
like we are today than
the antebellum North is

01:04:10.560 --> 01:04:12.800
like the United States today.

01:04:12.800 --> 01:04:15.040
And that's a sobering
thought, right?

01:04:15.040 --> 01:04:18.620
And I think there are a
lot of places we could go

01:04:18.620 --> 01:04:21.640
and there are ways to take
that analysis a little further,

01:04:21.640 --> 01:04:26.730
but I think what it means
is that-- certainly I

01:04:26.730 --> 01:04:30.860
read Piketty, and I find
a lot of richness there,

01:04:30.860 --> 01:04:33.920
a lot of interesting thoughts
for thinking about the slave

01:04:33.920 --> 01:04:38.240
South and for maybe
building future analyses.

01:04:38.240 --> 01:04:39.150
Thank you.

01:04:39.150 --> 01:04:40.870
Thanks for your questions.
