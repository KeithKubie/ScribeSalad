00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:02.620
Just as we have a notation for music,

00:00:02.620 --> 00:00:05.420
we have a notation for language, we have a notation for dance,

00:00:05.680 --> 00:00:08.340
we came up with a notation for juggling.

00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:10.820
And the really cool thing was that there was some unexpected

00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:17.250
mathematics underneath that then let us predict the existence of juggling tricks that, as far as we knew, had never been done before.

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:22.289
Well, the one I'm going to talk about is called siteswap. If you go on the Wikipedia page, it does

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:23.650
have a couple of alternative names.

00:00:23.650 --> 00:00:28.500
But really the place to start is with a little bit of juggling, so that you can see what it is

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:32.849
we're trying to capture. I'll just do three to start with, and a lot of people think that they'll go in a circle.

00:00:33.399 --> 00:00:36.449
But, in fact, the easiest thing to do is to throw them

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:40.469
so that they all come down in the same order. And if you do that,

00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:43.080
they've got yellow, green, orange,

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:45.480
and then it will be the yellow one's turn again.

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:50.219
But if my hand's taken in turns, that means the yellow has to change hands. So let me show you.

00:00:50.739 --> 00:00:55.200
Yellow with this hand, green with that hand, orange with this hand.

00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:57.140
So yellow green orange yellow green orange yellow

00:00:57.140 --> 00:01:00.680
green orange yellow green orange. And you'll see that they have to change hands

00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:05.549
because the balls are taking it in turns, and so are my hands.

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:08.099
And so it just works out that that's the way it goes.

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:14.040
So the first thing to be able to do is at least to be able to describe that juggling pattern

00:01:14.409 --> 00:01:18.389
in any notation that you use, and then, think to yourself,

00:01:18.389 --> 00:01:20.540
well, can I then also describe other ones?

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:24.270
So what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna have my left hand here, and my right hand here.

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:28.500
And I'm gonna have time running in this direction. So imagine that I'm walking

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:34.860
forwards as I juggle, and this, more or less, is where my left hand is, and this, more or less, is where my right hand is.

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:39.240
I'm gonna leave out some of the detail of my hands moving from side to side.

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:42.329
But I'm gonna say, as I'm walking forwards,

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:47.069
I'm gonna throw with the right hand from here, and that ball's gonna go over to the other hand.

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:52.049
I don't know when that balls gonna come down, but it's gonna go over to the other hand. And a moment later,

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:54.779
I'm gonna throw with the left hand, and then a moment later,

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:58.799
I'm gonna throw with the right hand, and then I'm gonna throw with the left hand, then I'm gonna throw with the

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:01.559
right hand, and then with the left hand. And I've got this this,

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:06.440
this rhythm about the whole thing, this, this constant metronomic beat going on here.

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:09.340
[tick tick tick tick tick tick tick]

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:13.660
So I'm gonna put the, the colors onto here now. So this one was with the yellow ball,

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:17.790
and this will also show you that they, they have to change hands, because if I throw the yellow one here,

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:23.339
and then I'll throw the green one next, and then I'll throw the orange one next, and then I've got to throw the yellow one here.

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:25.350
And so it has to be in the other hand.

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:31.440
And in truth, it comes down a little bit before that, so if we look at when it comes down, it might come down there,

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:34.020
and then it's in my hand for that moment there.

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:36.900
So there's the yellow ball going across to that hand there.

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:41.120
And then the green ball does the same thing. It goes over here, in that direction,

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:44.640
and then it's in my hand for a while, there. So that will be the green ball there.

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:48.750
And then the orange one gets thrown. It goes across to the other hand,

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:55.080
and so that's over here in this hand, and then that's the orange ball being thrown, and then the yellow one again,

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:59.460
and then the green one again, and then the orange one again.

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:02.980
[tick tick tick tick tick tick]

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:07.400
And, in fact, what we end up with here is a plait.

00:03:07.740 --> 00:03:14.880
And if you juggle and walk forwards, or, more particularly, juggle and walk backwards, look at the paths that the balls leave in the air.

00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:17.430
They literally form a braid.

00:03:17.740 --> 00:03:21.149
It's ephemeral, because the balls don't leave, actually, leave the trails behind,

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:26.070
but if you could imagine that. And a guy called Henry Segerman has made 3D printed models of

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:33.209
juggling tricks that are then pushed through time, pushed through space, so you can see the intermingling, interleaving of the balls.

00:03:33.209 --> 00:03:38.699
But here, what's happening now is, you can see that with three ball juggling, what's happening is

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:43.139
I throw the yellow ball, green ball, orange ball, then I throw the yellow one again, so the length of time

00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:49.139
from that throw of the yellow ball to that throw of the yellow ball is

00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:55.319
three beats of the clock, three ticks of the underlying metronome.

00:03:56.080 --> 00:03:58.960
[TICK tick tick TICK tick tick TICK]

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:03.120
So, if you've got this tick, and it goes yellow green orange, yellow green orange,

00:04:03.910 --> 00:04:08.969
then the yellow ball will be thrown every third time. So it's every third beat that the yellow ball gets thrown.

00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:15.899
Another little comment about this is that the actual flight time, the time that the ball spends in the air, has to be less,

00:04:16.480 --> 00:04:22.020
to allow for some time in the hand, what we call the hold of the juggling ball,

00:04:22.020 --> 00:04:26.819
and that's the dwell, the, the time that it's in the hand, and then we have the flight time here,

00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:28.820
and you'll see that flight time is a little bit less

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:36.239
than this time that it takes the balls to cycle around, and this is what we call the cycle time.

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:44.220
These names are not universally agreed. Some people call it the beat time, some people call it the underlying native time.

00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:47.900
[tick]

00:04:51.580 --> 00:04:52.160
[tick]

00:04:55.380 --> 00:04:55.980
[tick]

00:04:59.500 --> 00:05:00.160
[tick]

00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:04.240
[tick]

00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:06.640
And that's for three balls.

00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:11.680
Now let's move on to four balls, and see what happens. Yellow pink green

00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:13.020
and white.

00:05:13.420 --> 00:05:16.720
So yellow pink green white, yellow pink green white, so here we go. We go,

00:05:17.420 --> 00:05:23.650
yellow pink green white yellow pink green white yellow pink green white yellow pink green white yellow pink green white yellow pink green white yellow

00:05:23.650 --> 00:05:27.789
pink green white. And now, you'll see that the balls are actually staying in the same hands.

00:05:36.580 --> 00:05:39.359
So let's actually draw the diagram for four balls.

00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:45.000
I've got left hand and right hand. Throw it here, throw it here, throw it here, throw it here, throw it here.

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:49.160
And I've got yellow pink green white.

00:05:49.380 --> 00:05:50.540
And look, the yellow,

00:05:50.550 --> 00:05:53.430
it's the yellow's turn, and it's the right-hand's turn again.

00:05:53.770 --> 00:06:00.449
So the yellow has to come back to the same hand, and that's what we saw when I was actually doing the juggling. Yellow pink

00:06:00.820 --> 00:06:02.220
green white.

00:06:02.220 --> 00:06:07.100
So the yellow ball is thrown here, and next it has to be thrown there,

00:06:07.300 --> 00:06:12.660
so it stays in the same hand. I'm gonna have it bob around, so it comes around. Again, again,

00:06:12.660 --> 00:06:14.729
it has to come down that little bit early,

00:06:14.730 --> 00:06:19.259
I catch it before I throw it. Obviously, it has to spend some time in the hand.

00:06:20.050 --> 00:06:25.259
For simplicity, we often assume that that catch is exactly halfway between. In practice,

00:06:25.260 --> 00:06:28.230
it's not. In practice, your hand is full for more than half the time.

00:06:29.080 --> 00:06:33.000
Because the only time you can control the juggling prop is while you're holding it.

00:06:33.430 --> 00:06:37.139
So you tend to hold it for as long as you can to give you the maximum control.

00:06:37.660 --> 00:06:43.139
But you can see here, the yellow ball comes, and it's in air. And then the green ball does the same thing. It bobs

00:06:43.360 --> 00:06:46.110
over the time that I'm holding the yellow ball.

00:06:46.110 --> 00:06:49.830
and then it's in the hand, then the green, then the yellow ball gets launched again.

00:06:49.830 --> 00:06:54.870
And this is actually how it feels. It feels like you get these two balls

00:06:55.090 --> 00:06:59.819
bouncing over each other in the hand. And if I actually do yellow and green in the same hand, here,

00:06:59.920 --> 00:07:04.920
you can see that they, they really do feel like they're bouncing, one over the top of the other.

00:07:05.020 --> 00:07:09.930
It's almost like they're playing leapfrog. And, in fact, if you turn this side on, you can see that

00:07:09.930 --> 00:07:15.060
they're playing leapfrog over each other. Although, it's leapfrog through time, not leapfrog through space.

00:07:28.580 --> 00:07:34.090
But now, the interesting thing is, if we have a look at the time that the yellow ball gets thrown here,

00:07:34.090 --> 00:07:38.300
and then the time the yellow ball next gets thrown is there, and look, how long is that?

00:07:38.900 --> 00:07:42.240
Well, I've got a beat here, and then I go, one two three

00:07:42.560 --> 00:07:45.700
four beats. And you can see that that really is

00:07:46.310 --> 00:07:53.140
four beats of time from a throw of the yellow ball to the next throw of the yellow ball. And they're all doing the same thing.

00:07:53.750 --> 00:07:57.940
So they will all have a four beat cycle.

00:08:02.150 --> 00:08:08.049
In a moment, I'm gonna talk about throwing the balls to different heights. At the moment, they're all doing the same thing.

00:08:09.470 --> 00:08:15.760
So at the moment, I can say that the pattern has four beats between throws. But shortly, I'll talk about an

00:08:16.280 --> 00:08:19.540
individual throw being four beats.

00:08:19.550 --> 00:08:23.620
Okay, so, having seen three balls and three beats, four balls and four beats,

00:08:23.840 --> 00:08:29.410
we can fairly obviously go on and do five and six and seven, and there's no real interest in that.

00:08:30.050 --> 00:08:34.659
We can go down and ask what does it actually mean, now, based on this kind of diagram,

00:08:34.659 --> 00:08:39.129
can I draw a diagram for two balls? And what does then imply, that then imply,

00:08:39.500 --> 00:08:43.390
for the physical juggling? And one ball, and perhaps even zero balls.

00:08:43.510 --> 00:08:46.719
I'm not gonna do that yet, because I really want to get to the payoff.

00:08:46.720 --> 00:08:51.130
I want to get to the actual notation, and why it's interesting and what happens.

00:08:51.230 --> 00:08:54.610
So I'm gonna go back, and I'm gonna look at four ball juggling again. Yellow

00:08:55.220 --> 00:09:00.880
pink green and white. So that's what's going on there. And the yellow ball will be thrown next over here,

00:09:00.880 --> 00:09:06.609
and the pink ball will be thrown next over here, and the green ball thrown next over here, the white ball thrown next over here.

00:09:06.890 --> 00:09:11.859
We know that that's what's going on. But now, let's cheat. Now, let's do something slightly different.

00:09:11.920 --> 00:09:17.600
I'm looking at the yellow ball landing here, and I'm looking at the pink ball landing here, and I'm going, well, they're good friends.

00:09:18.680 --> 00:09:20.680
Why don't they change places?

00:09:20.810 --> 00:09:24.190
So, in fact, what we can have is the yellow ball

00:09:24.200 --> 00:09:25.450
not come to here,

00:09:25.450 --> 00:09:29.499
but actually go to there, where the pink ball would go. So the yellow ball actually goes

00:09:29.940 --> 00:09:34.010
to where the pink ball would go. And the pink ball actually goes to where the yellow ball would go.

00:09:35.040 --> 00:09:37.720
So they exchange

00:09:37.920 --> 00:09:42.260
landing sites. They swap their sites. It is a site

00:09:43.560 --> 00:09:47.520
swap, which is where we get the name of the notation from.

00:09:47.520 --> 00:09:50.419
They are swapping the places that they go to.

00:09:50.970 --> 00:09:52.430
And that's great on the diagram.

00:09:52.430 --> 00:09:58.729
What does it mean physically? Well, if we look at this, the yellow would normally have this cycle time of four.

00:09:59.340 --> 00:10:05.569
But now, the time it's next thrown is 1 2 3 4 5 beats of time in the future.

00:10:06.210 --> 00:10:12.199
And the pink ball would be, normally 1 2 3 4, but in fact, 1 2 3, it's three beats of time in the future.

00:10:12.930 --> 00:10:15.890
So what's happening is I'm doing lots of cycle time four

00:10:16.080 --> 00:10:19.910
throws, so I'm doing 4 4 4 4 4. And then, suddenly and without provocation,

00:10:19.920 --> 00:10:23.300
I'm doing a five and a three according to my diagram.

00:10:24.270 --> 00:10:29.599
And what's really nice is that actually turns out to be exactly the kind of throw that you do when juggling five balls,

00:10:29.760 --> 00:10:32.510
followed by exactly the kind of throw you do in juggling three balls.

00:10:33.300 --> 00:10:39.979
So what's predicted from the diagram turns out to be the case in reality. And if I demonstrate that,

00:10:40.620 --> 00:10:43.609
I need the yellow pink

00:10:44.370 --> 00:10:45.750
green and

00:10:45.750 --> 00:10:48.289
white, in that order. So, yellow pink green

00:10:48.290 --> 00:10:50.290
and I'm gonna do the yellow and the pink as the

00:10:50.490 --> 00:10:54.380
high and low, as the five and three, so if I just juggled four for a while,

00:10:54.380 --> 00:10:59.540
and then I'm gonna do the yellow ball high, and the pink ball low, so we, counting down, so, three,

00:11:00.220 --> 00:11:01.000
two,

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:01.780
one.

00:11:01.780 --> 00:11:02.480
Five three.

00:11:03.180 --> 00:11:09.960
And you'll see that they have changed hands, as is predicted by the diagram. The yellow did go high.

00:11:10.240 --> 00:11:15.340
The pink did go low. And they landed perfectly in rhythm, and I could just carry on.

00:11:15.540 --> 00:11:16.040
[tick]

00:11:17.340 --> 00:11:17.880
[tick]

00:11:19.800 --> 00:11:20.300
[tick]

00:11:21.400 --> 00:11:21.900
[tick]

00:11:24.040 --> 00:11:24.580
[tick]

00:11:26.620 --> 00:11:27.120
[tick]

00:11:28.580 --> 00:11:29.080
[tick]

00:11:31.200 --> 00:11:31.820
[tick]

00:11:33.060 --> 00:11:40.020
So the brilliant thing there is that the diagram lets us predict that this should work. And in fact, this is a juggling trick

00:11:40.020 --> 00:11:41.470
that's been known.

00:11:41.920 --> 00:11:49.020
And so now, we can say, okay, well, it's possible to do a four, and it's possible to do a five three.

00:11:50.200 --> 00:11:54.209
We could have a look at pushing two of them one later,

00:11:54.790 --> 00:12:00.480
and the other one has to be brought back more. So, instead of having a four four four,

00:12:01.089 --> 00:12:03.539
it becomes five five,

00:12:04.149 --> 00:12:06.149
and then the four has to become a two.

00:12:06.460 --> 00:12:07.940
So we end up with

00:12:08.280 --> 00:12:11.900
five five two. And that can also be done.

00:12:12.790 --> 00:12:15.060
And now, you can see a pattern building.

00:12:15.190 --> 00:12:21.059
So we get, look at these last numbers here, four three two, and you predict that there's going to be a one here.

00:12:21.060 --> 00:12:23.060
All of these are five, so we get

00:12:23.380 --> 00:12:30.150
five five five, and we predict that this should be possible. And we can do it just from the numbers.

00:12:30.820 --> 00:12:34.890
We can do it by drawing the diagram. And when we first did this,

00:12:35.380 --> 00:12:40.890
this was a juggling trick that we didn't know. And as far as I know, had actually never been done.

00:12:41.589 --> 00:12:45.449
When I took this to juggling conventions, people did not know it.

00:12:45.880 --> 00:12:49.109
After four months, people from America were trying to show it to me,

00:12:49.260 --> 00:12:54.179
because it was a juggling trick that had just gone right round the world, from juggling club to juggling club to juggling club.

00:12:54.880 --> 00:12:59.369
It's called the fake five, because it feels and sounds a lot like juggling five balls.

00:12:59.370 --> 00:13:02.549
And if I actually do it, here we go, so we get yellow,

00:13:03.190 --> 00:13:09.179
yellow pink green white. So we do a single shot at this, starting with the yellow ball,

00:13:09.670 --> 00:13:11.735
counting three, two, one,

00:13:11.735 --> 00:13:13.800
five five five one.

00:13:15.010 --> 00:13:20.369
And those three high throws are exactly the kind of throw that you would do if you're juggling five balls.

00:13:20.370 --> 00:13:25.649
But hang on, what's this one? What am I doing with the one? And you may have noticed I did a zip across underneath.

00:13:26.380 --> 00:13:29.909
And we can actually show that on the diagram, why that becomes inevitable.

00:13:45.600 --> 00:13:47.420
What's this one business?

00:13:47.420 --> 00:13:53.460
Well, once again, if we very very quickly sketch this, I say I'm throwing here, throwing here, throwing here, throwing here, throwing here, throwing

00:13:53.460 --> 00:13:55.460
here. I throw this ball,

00:13:55.540 --> 00:13:58.949
I've only got one, I have to throw it...  here.

00:13:59.170 --> 00:14:01.979
It's got to be the same ball. So that means that the ball

00:14:02.260 --> 00:14:05.670
basically has to zip across to be held in the hand for a short time,

00:14:05.950 --> 00:14:08.910
to be zipped across to be held in the hand for a short time.

00:14:09.610 --> 00:14:17.250
So, in essence, if, if the, if the catch is happening in the middle of those two throws, then basically, the ball gets zipped across,

00:14:17.440 --> 00:14:23.820
spending no time in the air at all. And we can start to talk about the flight time of the ball, and how that compares.

00:14:23.820 --> 00:14:30.209
And if the catches are always in the middle, then we always have the ball in the hand for one beat.

00:14:30.910 --> 00:14:37.560
So you've got your cycle time, you take up one beat of that with the dwell time, and the flight time is always, therefore,

00:14:37.810 --> 00:14:39.839
one less than the total cycle time.

00:14:41.170 --> 00:14:47.250
That has interesting implications if you look at zero ball juggling. Because that would mean that the ball actually has to go backwards in time.

00:14:47.950 --> 00:14:51.930
But there aren't any balls. But there are some interesting things that you can say about that.

00:14:52.240 --> 00:14:56.969
But here, we can do a one. A zero is basically having an empty hand.

00:14:57.460 --> 00:15:02.040
And so now, we can start to say, well, what, what are all of the possibilities?

00:15:02.520 --> 00:15:04.400
We can start to draw the diagrams.

00:15:04.400 --> 00:15:09.600
Are there other ways of inventing juggling tricks? Are there other ways of knowing that we've got them all?

00:15:10.180 --> 00:15:14.200
How does this help us find every possible juggling trick?

00:15:14.660 --> 00:15:16.200
When jugglers talk about the height of a ball,

00:15:16.200 --> 00:15:19.259
there are two possible things that they could mean. One is the physical height.

00:15:19.450 --> 00:15:24.180
But we also talk about the natural height of a five ball pattern.

00:15:24.180 --> 00:15:28.709
And we'll call that a height five. The natural height of a six ball pattern,

00:15:28.710 --> 00:15:31.889
and we'll call that a six. That varies according to the speed.

00:15:32.500 --> 00:15:34.450
But when you talk about the height of a ball,

00:15:34.450 --> 00:15:38.910
then you'll tend to mean the, the number of balls that you're juggling for that given

00:15:39.460 --> 00:15:41.460
physical height, so.

00:15:41.480 --> 00:15:43.480
The, the term is often used interchangeably,

00:15:44.240 --> 00:15:45.920
which can be confusing.

00:15:45.920 --> 00:15:49.680
But once you use it often enough, it, it stops being something that you worry about.

00:15:50.140 --> 00:15:53.380
There are weight diagrams that help us, which are finite state diagrams.

00:15:54.120 --> 00:15:59.340
But I can show you a finite state diagram for every possible three ball juggling pattern,

00:15:59.740 --> 00:16:02.700
where the height of throw never exceeds five.

00:16:02.980 --> 00:16:04.180
So let's do that.

00:16:04.620 --> 00:16:06.300
What I do know is that there are

00:16:06.890 --> 00:16:10.629
ten places to be, and as I draw this, you'll think, hang on,

00:16:10.630 --> 00:16:13.419
that's only eight. But I'm gonna put an extra one here, and an extra one here.

00:16:13.640 --> 00:16:15.640
And I'm gonna start in a strange place.

00:16:15.640 --> 00:16:16.840
I'm gonna start here,

00:16:16.840 --> 00:16:22.059
and I'm gonna label that arrow as a three. And the way you read this diagram

00:16:22.060 --> 00:16:28.419
is that you follow the arrow and write down the number, and that tells you the cycle time of the throw you're doing.

00:16:28.940 --> 00:16:35.440
So this tells you that I can do three three three three three three, and that's good because that's the native three ball pattern.

00:16:35.800 --> 00:16:37.060
[tick tick tick]

00:16:37.240 --> 00:16:41.660
From there, I could also do a four, and come back with a two.

00:16:42.120 --> 00:16:44.120
[tick tick tick tick tick]

00:16:46.660 --> 00:16:50.380
Now, I haven't talked about a two. But basically, if you've got two juggling balls,

00:16:50.450 --> 00:16:55.599
then really, the only thing that you're gonna do is two two two two two two two two two two.

00:16:55.600 --> 00:16:59.620
And if you draw the diagram, that really is how it looks. You're just hanging on to the balls.

00:16:59.620 --> 00:17:03.460
You don't really even need to let them go. So that's green and orange.

00:17:03.780 --> 00:17:05.540
Okay, so having done that,

00:17:05.540 --> 00:17:10.660
if I do a four, it turns out that I can actually do a five after that, if I choose.

00:17:11.140 --> 00:17:12.460
Two going there.

00:17:12.460 --> 00:17:18.380
There's also a one coming back here. And if I stop for a moment and pull out some of the patterns that we've got here,

00:17:19.250 --> 00:17:21.250
four four one

00:17:22.459 --> 00:17:27.939
was one of the very very earliest patterns that we ever found by using these techniques.

00:17:27.940 --> 00:17:30.549
And that's the one that I use to torture

00:17:30.550 --> 00:17:36.039
the really good jugglers at the European juggling convention, because it's only three ball juggling,

00:17:36.530 --> 00:17:41.379
it looks a lot like a pattern that they know, which is called the box.

00:17:41.860 --> 00:17:43.380
But it's not.

00:17:43.380 --> 00:17:45.400
It's much easier. It's much lower.

00:17:45.400 --> 00:17:50.739
It's much cleaner. And every time I showed it to them, and they tried to do it, they couldn't do it.

00:17:50.740 --> 00:17:54.900
So this was a great way of getting really good jugglers hooked on this,

00:17:54.900 --> 00:17:58.650
where did you find this pattern? And so I could then start to talk about this.

00:17:58.650 --> 00:18:00.980
Brady: "What does a 4 4 1 look like?"

00:18:00.980 --> 00:18:03.340
4 4 1, okay, so, 4 4 1.

00:18:03.720 --> 00:18:08.960
What I have to do is I have to do a 4, and then a 4, and then a 1. Now I'll do that.

00:18:08.970 --> 00:18:13.799
I'll start with three ball juggling, and then I'll start, I'll just do a single shot, starting with the orange ball,

00:18:14.530 --> 00:18:17.340
and so next time round, so we get 4 4 1.

00:18:17.530 --> 00:18:21.749
And I'll do it again, one shot, 4 4 1. And now if I do it constantly,

00:18:22.020 --> 00:18:26.160
We get 441, 441, 441, 441.

00:18:26.160 --> 00:18:28.560
And if you watch, each ball goes everywhere.

00:18:28.560 --> 00:18:33.690
And that's the really cool thing about this pattern, is, all three balls are doing the same thing,

00:18:34.030 --> 00:18:35.470
but out of phase,

00:18:35.470 --> 00:18:40.319
in such a way that they all meet together. And then, in the middle of doing all of that,

00:18:40.320 --> 00:18:44.639
you can simply drop back to doing three balls, and it just ... disappears.

00:18:44.860 --> 00:18:51.360
It's just a really cool neat clean pattern, and, and I love it particularly, 'cause it's one of one of the ones we found.

00:19:03.460 --> 00:19:08.759
Now there's an interesting thing that happens here is that you get patterns that start and finish here,

00:19:08.770 --> 00:19:15.810
but don't travel over there, and patterns that start and finish here, but don't travel over there. And so, within the juggling world,

00:19:15.810 --> 00:19:17.080
there's a thing known as

00:19:17.080 --> 00:19:22.040
excited patterns, that you can't do just starting from the three ball cascade.

00:19:22.900 --> 00:19:29.370
And they're a ground state, which are patterns that you can. So, for example, five three one, five three one,

00:19:29.370 --> 00:19:31.500
you can just patch that into the middle of a cascade.

00:19:36.370 --> 00:19:41.969
But five one five one, which is the three ball shower, where the balls go in that cyclic pattern, that everybody thinks

00:19:41.970 --> 00:19:43.970
they know is the way you juggle,

00:19:47.560 --> 00:19:52.169
you can't actually do that, instantly starting from the cascade, starting from the three ball

00:19:52.450 --> 00:19:58.080
figure of eight. You have to do a preparatory throw. And there are different preparatory throws that you can do.

00:19:58.390 --> 00:20:00.390
So, for example, you can do a four,

00:20:01.030 --> 00:20:03.030
five one five one five one five one.

00:20:03.190 --> 00:20:05.730
What people used to do is a five two,

00:20:06.040 --> 00:20:11.639
five one five one five one, and they have, each has their own merits, and so forth. But now,

00:20:12.240 --> 00:20:20.440
every traversal of this, of this diagram, every way of wandering around on this diagram and writing down the black numbers as you go,

00:20:20.440 --> 00:20:21.900
gives you

00:20:22.460 --> 00:20:25.820
a jugglable sequence of numbers.

00:20:26.020 --> 00:20:29.760
Brady: "How many different sequences are possible? How many different tricks are there?"

00:20:29.760 --> 00:20:36.120
It becomes really messy if you try and do it by saying, how many are there of a certain maximum cycle time,

00:20:36.360 --> 00:20:41.360
what we would normally call height, but there is a lovely formula that's slightly

00:20:42.430 --> 00:20:45.509
unexpected and slightly unusual in its terms.

00:20:45.940 --> 00:20:49.710
But if we ask for a repeating pattern,

00:20:50.050 --> 00:20:53.970
and ask for a repeating period of, say, length n,

00:20:54.730 --> 00:20:58.829
and now this is the unusual bit that people don't expect, and then we say, up to

00:20:59.740 --> 00:21:04.799
b balls, but not including, so that's strictly less than b balls,

00:21:05.530 --> 00:21:07.530
then the number of patterns,

00:21:09.130 --> 00:21:11.189
the number of possible patterns

00:21:12.009 --> 00:21:14.009
is b to the power of n.

00:21:14.800 --> 00:21:17.280
Which is just unexpectedly simple.

00:21:17.280 --> 00:21:20.320
Brady: "What does a zero mean? On your diagram, what does a zero mean?"

00:21:20.320 --> 00:21:25.820
On my diagram it means at this point I'm scheduled to do a throw, but all the balls are currently in the air.

00:21:25.830 --> 00:21:27.840
So I have zero juggling balls to throw.

00:21:28.090 --> 00:21:29.450
Brady: "And what does a one mean?"

00:21:29.450 --> 00:21:34.110
A one is this one that transfers directly from one hand to the other. So if I've only got one,

00:21:34.269 --> 00:21:37.529
juggling ball, I actually just transfer it from one hand to the other. Now again,

00:21:37.529 --> 00:21:40.013
my hands are full for exactly half the time.

00:21:40.013 --> 00:21:40.860
Brady: "A two?"

00:21:40.860 --> 00:21:42.180
A two is doing this.

00:21:42.180 --> 00:21:45.320
Which is surprisingly difficult, because you have to throw and catch.

00:21:45.330 --> 00:21:46.179
But in truth,

00:21:46.179 --> 00:21:51.238
in the middle of juggling and having lots of balls in the air all at the same time, you would never let that go.

00:21:51.249 --> 00:21:55.409
You actually just hold it up and show it to display, rather than releasing it.

00:21:55.409 --> 00:21:56.440
You'd never do that.

00:21:56.440 --> 00:21:57.300
Brady: "And a three?"

00:21:57.760 --> 00:21:59.279
The three is actually when we're juggling three balls.

00:21:59.279 --> 00:22:02.878
It's, it's the first what people think of as proper juggling.

00:22:03.190 --> 00:22:07.409
But when you look at the the, the notation that we've got, the structure,

00:22:07.659 --> 00:22:11.849
the diagrams, the mathematics underneath it of how the patterns and timings work,

00:22:12.399 --> 00:22:20.189
this fits neatly and cleanly into the whole thing, as does this for one ball, as does this for zero balls.

00:22:20.190 --> 00:22:26.970
Brady: "What proportion of professional jugglers are into the math and the notation, and what percentage of them think this is just

00:22:27.129 --> 00:22:28.836
"a nerdy way of looking at their art?"

00:22:28.840 --> 00:22:30.380
It's fairly clear that

00:22:30.780 --> 00:22:33.140
almost everybody who's heard of the notation,

00:22:33.909 --> 00:22:39.988
and it really is split fairly evenly, you know, it might not be fifty-fifty, it might be sixty-forty,

00:22:39.989 --> 00:22:47.789
but, but there's a good proportion of people who actually can use this to communicate with each other, a slightly smaller

00:22:48.070 --> 00:22:53.820
proportion who can use this to devise notations, and of course we've got rules underneath this, and the idea

00:22:53.820 --> 00:22:57.840
then is how do we break these rules to do things which are more artistic potentially?

00:22:57.879 --> 00:23:00.299
Then you get the jazz musicians, for whom

00:23:00.489 --> 00:23:06.389
writing down music kind of kills it. And they don't want the music written down, they want to ornate around a theme.

00:23:06.879 --> 00:23:12.389
And as you get out into that side of the, the juggling world, they don't like this. They know it's there.

00:23:12.389 --> 00:23:16.529
They don't want to use it. If somebody comes to them and says, this is a really cool pattern.

00:23:16.529 --> 00:23:19.349
What can you make of this? They want you to demonstrate

00:23:19.350 --> 00:23:24.299
what it is, so they can then elaborate on top of it, do variations on top of it,

00:23:24.820 --> 00:23:27.660
mutate it into something that's, that's not as

00:23:28.260 --> 00:23:29.200
technical as this.

00:23:29.580 --> 00:23:32.180
Brady: "Can you watch live juggling and sort of almost see the numbers?"

00:23:32.560 --> 00:23:37.640
Yeah, absolutely. And again, live juggling, you get the, the superb fluid

00:23:38.500 --> 00:23:45.390
dynamic creative dance performance. But then, you look at it and go, okay, that was four four one,

00:23:48.610 --> 00:23:52.920
done in a gorgeous way. And that was just four two done in a very clever way.

00:23:57.610 --> 00:24:00.030
So I do pick out what the patterns are.

00:24:00.340 --> 00:24:05.640
And it's really interesting, because it does then mean that I don't have to concentrate on some of the aspects of it.

00:24:05.710 --> 00:24:09.240
It frees up my brain to, to think about the rest of it.

00:24:09.360 --> 00:24:11.520
It's like chunking in maths.

00:24:12.000 --> 00:24:17.760
Once you get a particular skill really under control, it frees up your brain to think about the next phase.

00:24:17.760 --> 00:24:24.749
It's like playing a sport, dribbling the ball in football, playing a forehand drive in tennis, it has to be totally

00:24:24.970 --> 00:24:26.970
mechanical, has to be totally

00:24:27.190 --> 00:24:32.790
as easy as breathing, so that it frees up your mind to think about the structure of the game, the structure of what's going on.

00:24:32.790 --> 00:24:34.790
And so it is when I watch juggling.

00:24:34.960 --> 00:24:41.970
I see the pattern and I have the siteswap in my head of what they're doing, and that then lets me see more about what's going on,
