ANDREW BROGDON: Hey, everybody.

00:00:06.550 --> 00:00:09.480
I'm Andrew Brogdon, and welcome
back to the Mobile Ads Garage.

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:13.590
Today, with the help of my
partner, Gary the graphics guy,

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:15.810
I'm going to talk about
AdMob and Google Analytics

00:00:15.810 --> 00:00:17.109
for Firebase.

00:00:17.109 --> 00:00:19.650
Publishers have been able to
use Analytics and AdMob together

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:21.486
for a while now,
but Engineering just

00:00:21.486 --> 00:00:22.860
rolled out some
new features that

00:00:22.860 --> 00:00:25.950
make them smarter and more
powerful in combination.

00:00:25.950 --> 00:00:28.170
Plus, everything I'm
about to show you

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:31.620
requires no code changes beyond
a Gradle or a Podfile update.

00:00:31.620 --> 00:00:33.600
And the Analytics are
free and unlimited.

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:35.920
[MUSIC, CHEERING, AND FIREWORKS]

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:36.550
I know, right?

00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:37.925
That's the most
fun sentence I've

00:00:37.925 --> 00:00:41.640
gotten to say in this
entire video series.

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:43.360
All right, now.

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:43.860
OK.

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:45.650
Let's take a look at
how AdMob and Google

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:48.270
Analytics for Firebase
are working together.

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:50.100
If you're already a
Firebase developer,

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:52.140
or you saw our earlier
episode introducing

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:55.270
AdMob with Firebase, you're
probably familiar with these.

00:00:55.270 --> 00:00:57.300
They're the Gradle
dependencies and CocoaPods

00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:59.370
for AdMob and Firebase core.

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:01.117
That core includes Analytics.

00:01:01.117 --> 00:01:02.700
So when you build
your app with these,

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:06.047
you get the SDKs for both
of those services included.

00:01:06.047 --> 00:01:08.130
Now, they each have a
backend service in the cloud

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:09.479
that they send data to.

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:11.520
That's how you get all
that juicy AdMob reporting

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:14.550
data and all the stats
that show up in Analytics.

00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:16.560
The new piece that the
engineering team just

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:18.430
finished building is this--

00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:20.790
a link between the
two systems, which

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:23.700
means AdMob reporting data,
real dollars and cents,

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:26.090
now appears in Google
Analytics for Firebase,

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:29.190
and Analytics data shows
up in AdMob reporting.

00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:30.930
So again, all you
have to do is make

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:33.420
sure you've linked your AdMob
app to a Firebase project

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:35.287
in the AdMob app settings.

00:01:35.287 --> 00:01:37.620
And make sure you're building
it with these dependencies

00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:40.140
on Android and these
CocoaPods in iOS,

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:43.030
and this connection will
start working for you.

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:45.720
Now, let's take a look at how
that data is made available

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:47.370
once it's up there
on the server.

00:01:47.370 --> 00:01:49.320
We'll start with the
AdMob reporting interface

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:51.780
and see what Analytics
data we can play with.

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:53.520
All right, so
here's the AdMob UI.

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:55.350
And some of you might
be thinking, hey,

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:57.990
that looks different than it did
when I logged in this morning.

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:00.900
At I/O '17, AdMob announced
a new version of the web UI,

00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:02.640
and it's being
rolled out right now.

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:04.410
You get the same
AdMob functionality,

00:02:04.410 --> 00:02:06.780
plus some new stuff
like mediation groups

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:07.692
right in there--

00:02:07.692 --> 00:02:09.150
and look for a blog
post about that

00:02:09.150 --> 00:02:12.690
in the video description-- plus
a new material design look.

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:14.220
Because the UI has
been updated, I'm

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:16.511
just going to go over, real
quick, how to link an AdMob

00:02:16.511 --> 00:02:17.550
app with Firebase.

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:21.370
So here, you just
go to app settings.

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:24.580
And you can see the option
to link is right there.

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:27.180
So I just click the
Link to Firebase button,

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:29.820
and I'm asked to confirm
the package name of the app.

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:32.310
I like to use the package
names for my app names

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:34.200
when registering apps
in AdMob, so I can just

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:36.120
type the same thing again.

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:39.180
Firebase space is a lot of
stuff on bundle IDs and package

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:41.160
names, so it's important
to get these right.

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:42.900
Now, AdMob's checked
my Firebase account

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:45.024
and given me the option to
connect with an existing

00:02:45.024 --> 00:02:46.650
project or start a new one.

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:48.360
And I'm going to
start a new one.

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:51.810
So I type in a name for my
new Firebase project, click

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:54.400
Continue, and I'm linked up.

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:56.230
So again, all that's
really required here

00:02:56.230 --> 00:02:58.690
is to use the Gradle and
CocoaPod dependencies you just

00:02:58.690 --> 00:03:00.640
saw, and link your app.

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:02.440
Do make sure that
when you do the link,

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:06.140
you don't forget to grab the
configuration file right there

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:07.870
and drop it into
your project as well.

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:09.340
Check our Firebase
Quickstart-- and there's

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:11.290
a link for that in the
description-- for more

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:13.229
details on what's in that file.

00:03:13.229 --> 00:03:15.520
So let's say it's a week
after I release my new version

00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:16.930
with Analytics compiled in.

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:21.342
And I come back to the AdMob
UI, what new things can I see?

00:03:21.342 --> 00:03:23.300
So there's two big ones,
and they're right here

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:24.080
on this screen--

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:27.365
the revenue card
and user metrics.

00:03:27.365 --> 00:03:31.190
I like revenue, so let's check
that one out first and zoom in.

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:32.160
Cool.

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:34.029
So first, you get a
straight bar chart

00:03:34.029 --> 00:03:36.320
that shows you the revenue
generated by your app, which

00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:38.653
doesn't seem like much, but
notice these categories down

00:03:38.653 --> 00:03:39.620
here.

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:41.000
That's not just ad revenue.

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:42.590
By hooking into
Firebase, AdMob is

00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:44.420
able to give you the
big picture, including

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:45.909
all the ways you're earning.

00:03:45.909 --> 00:03:48.200
So if you've got a game out
there with in-app purchases

00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:50.000
and ads, you don't
have to go bouncing

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:52.041
around different consoles
to get all the numbers.

00:03:52.041 --> 00:03:54.410
It's right there.

00:03:54.410 --> 00:03:57.140
On the user metrics
card, it's a dashboard

00:03:57.140 --> 00:03:59.350
presenting some important
numbers for app publishers.

00:03:59.350 --> 00:04:01.100
Some of these are
pretty self-explanatory,

00:04:01.100 --> 00:04:02.960
like sessions per
day and active users.

00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:05.060
There are a couple I want
to point out, though.

00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:07.570
First is ad exposure.

00:04:07.570 --> 00:04:10.030
This is a measure of how
much of a user's session

00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:12.070
was spent being exposed to ads.

00:04:12.070 --> 00:04:13.990
Ideally, you want to
make the revenue you need

00:04:13.990 --> 00:04:15.280
while keeping that number low.

00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:16.912
So it's good to
keep an eye on it.

00:04:16.912 --> 00:04:18.370
The other stats I
want to point out

00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:21.130
are the average revenue numbers.

00:04:21.130 --> 00:04:23.080
These tell you the
average revenue per user

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:25.680
and the average revenue
per paying user.

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:28.390
ARPU, as it's called,
is all your revenue

00:04:28.390 --> 00:04:29.620
divided by all your users.

00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:31.200
And it's a key stat.

00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:34.480
ARPPU, which I can't pronounce
with a straight face,

00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:36.490
calculates IAP and
commerce revenue

00:04:36.490 --> 00:04:38.079
for users making
a purchase, which

00:04:38.079 --> 00:04:40.120
lets you know how you're
doing with users engaged

00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:42.540
enough to open their wallets.

00:04:42.540 --> 00:04:44.290
So that's AdMob
reporting, which gives you

00:04:44.290 --> 00:04:46.456
the same kind of information
you're used to getting,

00:04:46.456 --> 00:04:49.480
but with new intelligence from
Google Analytics for Firebase.

00:04:49.480 --> 00:04:51.520
Now let's take a look
at the Analytics console

00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:54.587
and see how AdMob data
makes an impact there.

00:04:54.587 --> 00:04:56.170
So here we are in
the Firebase console

00:04:56.170 --> 00:04:57.190
in the Analytics section.

00:04:57.190 --> 00:04:58.570
And I'm going to
scroll right down

00:04:58.570 --> 00:05:00.611
and zoom into the first
thing I want to show you,

00:05:00.611 --> 00:05:04.100
which is LTV, or Lifetime Value.

00:05:04.100 --> 00:05:05.080
There we go.

00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:08.170
Previously, this value did
not include AdMob ad revenue.

00:05:08.170 --> 00:05:10.764
But after the link-up
between systems, it does.

00:05:10.764 --> 00:05:12.430
So this number can
now tell you how much

00:05:12.430 --> 00:05:14.950
total revenue from
ads and purchases

00:05:14.950 --> 00:05:16.750
you're averaging per user.

00:05:16.750 --> 00:05:19.150
If you're running a universal
app campaign in AdWords

00:05:19.150 --> 00:05:21.820
to grow your user base, you need
to know how much revenue you

00:05:21.820 --> 00:05:24.319
can expect from each user so
you can figure out how much you

00:05:24.319 --> 00:05:26.230
can spend to acquire them.

00:05:26.230 --> 00:05:28.150
And with AdMob data
included, you've

00:05:28.150 --> 00:05:30.054
now got a complete value.

00:05:30.054 --> 00:05:32.470
I'm going to zoom back out and
head over to the Events tab

00:05:32.470 --> 00:05:34.510
now to show you two
new events that have

00:05:34.510 --> 00:05:36.052
made their way into Analytics.

00:05:36.052 --> 00:05:37.510
And they're right
here at the top--

00:05:37.510 --> 00:05:39.730
ad click and ad impression.

00:05:39.730 --> 00:05:41.650
These are automatically
generated for you.

00:05:41.650 --> 00:05:43.990
And you can use them just
like any other event-- session

00:05:43.990 --> 00:05:46.340
start, change of
screen, you name it.

00:05:46.340 --> 00:05:47.920
So let me dig into one.

00:05:47.920 --> 00:05:49.030
Let's do ad impression.

00:05:49.030 --> 00:05:51.812
And I'm going to take
a spin down the page

00:05:51.812 --> 00:05:52.770
once it gets loaded up.

00:05:55.530 --> 00:05:56.430
There we go.

00:05:56.430 --> 00:05:58.490
So these are broken down
by ad unit right now.

00:05:58.490 --> 00:06:01.400
And I've got stats for clicks,
impressions, and revenue.

00:06:01.400 --> 00:06:04.920
Plus, that new ad exposure
metric is available.

00:06:04.920 --> 00:06:07.020
Let me show you a cool
trick you can do here.

00:06:07.020 --> 00:06:09.080
I'm going to change the
grouping from ad unit

00:06:09.080 --> 00:06:11.270
to grouping by screen class.

00:06:11.270 --> 00:06:13.340
This field is generated
for you using the class

00:06:13.340 --> 00:06:15.272
names for activities
and view controllers,

00:06:15.272 --> 00:06:17.480
or you can customize it with
calls into the Analytics

00:06:17.480 --> 00:06:19.020
library on the mobile side.

00:06:19.020 --> 00:06:21.710
Check out game board
and main menu here.

00:06:21.710 --> 00:06:25.490
You can see the ad exposure is
almost entirely on game board.

00:06:25.490 --> 00:06:30.000
It's 94%, compared to only
1.3% for the main menu.

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:31.430
That's more than 70 to 1.

00:06:31.430 --> 00:06:36.140
But when I look at revenue,
it's about 15 to 1.

00:06:36.140 --> 00:06:38.519
That means my users are more
receptive on the main menu

00:06:38.519 --> 00:06:40.310
than they are while
playing the game, which

00:06:40.310 --> 00:06:42.950
is a piece of intel I can use
in shaping my monetization

00:06:42.950 --> 00:06:43.867
strategy.

00:06:43.867 --> 00:06:45.950
Maybe I want to try removing
ads on the game board

00:06:45.950 --> 00:06:47.825
and using something like
an interstitial that

00:06:47.825 --> 00:06:48.975
appears between actions.

00:06:48.975 --> 00:06:50.600
Or maybe I want to
try a richer format,

00:06:50.600 --> 00:06:53.270
like native, in the main menu,
see if I can push engagement

00:06:53.270 --> 00:06:54.592
even higher there.

00:06:54.592 --> 00:06:56.300
The idea here is that
Analytics gives you

00:06:56.300 --> 00:06:58.160
actionable intelligence
on your users

00:06:58.160 --> 00:07:00.530
that you can really put to work.

00:07:00.530 --> 00:07:02.969
I'm going to pop back out
to the list of events now.

00:07:02.969 --> 00:07:04.760
And I just want to
mention that once you've

00:07:04.760 --> 00:07:07.220
got Analytics in your app,
you can start extending it

00:07:07.220 --> 00:07:08.780
for a custom solution.

00:07:08.780 --> 00:07:12.109
For example, these ad
events are automatic.

00:07:12.109 --> 00:07:14.400
But if you want your app to
log an event called "reward

00:07:14.400 --> 00:07:16.860
received" every time a user
watches a rewarded video ad

00:07:16.860 --> 00:07:18.684
to completion, you can do that.

00:07:18.684 --> 00:07:20.100
I'll put a link
in the description

00:07:20.100 --> 00:07:21.780
below to the Firecast
series, which

00:07:21.780 --> 00:07:24.660
can show you how to log your
own events in Analytics.

00:07:24.660 --> 00:07:27.420
In addition, I also have all
the other Firebase services

00:07:27.420 --> 00:07:30.810
that I can choose to
integrate, like Remote Config.

00:07:30.810 --> 00:07:34.110
For example, I can make a custom
audience based on my events

00:07:34.110 --> 00:07:35.820
and send different
configurations down

00:07:35.820 --> 00:07:37.530
to the device based on that.

00:07:37.530 --> 00:07:39.390
I could create a
reward received event,

00:07:39.390 --> 00:07:41.370
like we just talked
about, make an audience

00:07:41.370 --> 00:07:43.200
of those users who've
experienced it,

00:07:43.200 --> 00:07:45.990
and then use Remote Config
to turn off all the other ad

00:07:45.990 --> 00:07:48.622
formats in the app and
focus on rewarded video.

00:07:48.622 --> 00:07:50.580
You'd have to spend a
day or two in mobile code

00:07:50.580 --> 00:07:53.040
to make that happen, but
it's there if you want it.

00:07:53.040 --> 00:07:55.080
Similarly, if I have
a subset of my users

00:07:55.080 --> 00:07:57.014
that spend a lot on
in-app purchases,

00:07:57.014 --> 00:07:58.680
maybe I'd prefer to
show them a house ad

00:07:58.680 --> 00:08:01.775
campaign for my other apps
instead of normal AdMob ads.

00:08:01.775 --> 00:08:03.900
I could use Remote Config
to send down different ad

00:08:03.900 --> 00:08:05.790
units based on
audience, and then use

00:08:05.790 --> 00:08:07.050
them to make my ad requests.

00:08:07.050 --> 00:08:09.270
There's just a ton you
can play with here now

00:08:09.270 --> 00:08:11.792
that all this information
is in one place.

00:08:11.792 --> 00:08:12.750
So that's it for today.

00:08:12.750 --> 00:08:15.360
Before you go, though, I've
got some resources for you.

00:08:15.360 --> 00:08:16.860
If you look down
in the description,

00:08:16.860 --> 00:08:19.401
you'll see links to the AdMob
with Firebase Quickstart guides

00:08:19.401 --> 00:08:22.500
for Android and iOS, plus
a help center article that

00:08:22.500 --> 00:08:25.230
covers how to link an AdMob
app with a Firebase project

00:08:25.230 --> 00:08:27.150
in case you haven't
done that step.

00:08:27.150 --> 00:08:28.859
You'll also find a
link to our SDK forum,

00:08:28.859 --> 00:08:31.233
where you're welcome to bring
any technical questions you

00:08:31.233 --> 00:08:31.946
have.

00:08:31.946 --> 00:08:34.320
And if you've got a question
about this series or an idea

00:08:34.320 --> 00:08:37.030
for something you'd like us to
cover, leave a comment below.

00:08:37.030 --> 00:08:38.850
And Gary and I will
see you next time.

00:08:38.850 --> 00:08:42.500
