00:00:01.360 --> 00:00:04.360
So, the questions that
have been at the heart

00:00:04.360 --> 00:00:08.540
of my historical work have
been those of what is it

00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:12.070
to be a human and are
humans all the same

00:00:12.070 --> 00:00:14.460
in their rights and
opportunities.

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:17.880
Why have they not always
been always treated that way?

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:23.770
And what are the moments of
truth that a war or other kinds

00:00:23.770 --> 00:00:30.210
of intense social experiences
can extract from humans

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:34.240
that give us a special insight
into who they really are

00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:38.590
when they are tested and when we
see them under the most severe

00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:40.980
of pressures on conditions.
