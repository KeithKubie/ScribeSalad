00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:32.280
Leonard Barkan: I've written a book about a
different Michelangelo. 

00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:34.350
It's still the same guy. 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:40.350
Michelangelo Buonarotti: Florentine architect,
painter, sculptor, poet. 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:41.989
But, it's not the

00:00:41.989 --> 00:00:48.850
Michelangelo who produced things like the
"David," the "Moses," the Sistine ceiling.

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:52.850
It's the Michelangelo who produced things
for his eyes only. 

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:55.909
So, the book, which is

00:00:55.909 --> 00:01:02.300
called, "Michelangelo: A Life on Paper," is
about that life. It's really about his interior

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:08.590
life. And it's an archive of the things that
he put together when his mind was wandering

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:16.590
and his hand was wandering, and words popped
into his head or drawings seeped out of his pen.

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:25.320
For me, it's the incongruity, it's the
randomness, it's the accidental quality, it's

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:32.159
the private quality of these sheets of paper
that makes them fascinating. At the same time,

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:37.640
it's an archive of his practical life, because
it turns out that he did all kinds of different

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:44.640
things on the same sheets of paper which are
a mixture of bits of poetry, memos to self,

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:54.859
lists for foods and expenditures and moneys...
all mixed in with drawings that range from

00:01:54.859 --> 00:02:01.649
everything from doodles to sublime figure
sketches. But the other thing we have, is

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:09.970
that we have private, passionate remarks.
The kinds of phrases that can only bubble

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:16.970
up from an intense and tortured soul. 

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:21.500
He has at some point drawn a cherub 
and he has also

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:27.760
turned the sheet ninety degrees and written
the direct quotation from a very nostalgic

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:35.310
poem by Petrarch about his own home territory
about the Vaucluse. But, as though it's seamlessly

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:42.140
connected, Michelangelo continues this Latin
poem by writing, in Italian, "Don't make me

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:45.260
draw tonight because Perino isn't here." 

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:51.270
On this sheet he writes, "Lavoglia invoglia e

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:57.670
poi lascia la doglia" (Desire engenders desire
and then leaves pain). And next to it, he

00:02:57.670 --> 00:03:02.920
writes, "Death is the end of a dark prison."
But in the midst of this, he has contracts,

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:12.920
he has angry statements and he also draws
a large, rather ungainly hand, 

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:15.500
and two very long, extended bodies. 

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:24.830
It is the strange interconnections
among some of these drawings and these passionate

00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:30.550
utterances that point somewhere to a private
space, that I think, without these pieces

00:03:30.550 --> 00:03:33.880
of paper we would never glimpse. 

00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:36.880
And, so he loved words and,
of course, we know he loved

00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:45.430
pictures. So, one of the ways that this book
tells its story about Michelangelo is to understand

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:51.640
that the connections between words and pictures
in his life were much more intimate and also

00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:53.590
more mysterious than we might have thought.

00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:58.590
We have these sheets with completely incongruous

00:03:58.590 --> 00:04:06.710
and unrelated fragments on them. And for me
these sheets of paper, with their quite bizarre

00:04:06.710 --> 00:04:12.940
and mysterious mixtures of words and images,
are very very much like dreams. Really, the

00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:21.430
kind of dream that Freud analyzed in which
there are strange, unexpected juxtapositions.

00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:27.740
Juxtapositions that if you look carefully,
and think carefully about the whole life of

00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:33.210
the subject (whether that's a subject on an
analytic couch or a subject who is reclining

00:04:33.210 --> 00:04:41.000
as he paints the Sistine ceiling), if you look
carefully at these mysterious, seemingly disconnected

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:47.340
utterances, you have a sense of what Freud
would call Michelangelo's unconscious.
