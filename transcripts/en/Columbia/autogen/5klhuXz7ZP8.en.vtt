there had been animals in these

you know wolves and cougars and so on

00:13:05.830 --> 00:13:05.840
you know wolves and cougars and so on
 

00:13:05.840 --> 00:13:09.320
you know wolves and cougars and so on
but they didn't eat the Sheep or they

00:13:09.320 --> 00:13:09.330
but they didn't eat the Sheep or they
 

00:13:09.330 --> 00:13:14.800
but they didn't eat the Sheep or they
didn't eat the sheep fast enough I think

00:13:14.800 --> 00:13:14.810
didn't eat the sheep fast enough I think
 

00:13:14.810 --> 00:13:19.790
didn't eat the sheep fast enough I think
that the why that's the case I think it

00:13:19.790 --> 00:13:19.800
that the why that's the case I think it
 

00:13:19.800 --> 00:13:22.220
that the why that's the case I think it
would be interesting to find out I mean

would be interesting to find out I mean
 

00:13:22.230 --> 00:13:23.810
would be interesting to find out I mean
was it that if you were a cougar you

00:13:23.810 --> 00:13:23.820
was it that if you were a cougar you
 

00:13:23.820 --> 00:13:27.200
was it that if you were a cougar you
thought I could eat that but it's just a

thought I could eat that but it's just a
 

00:13:27.210 --> 00:13:31.160
thought I could eat that but it's just a
big mouthful of wool and and frankly it

00:13:31.160 --> 00:13:31.170
big mouthful of wool and and frankly it
 

00:13:31.170 --> 00:13:34.550

things about prey predator systems is

00:13:43.040 --> 00:13:43.050
things about prey predator systems is
 

00:13:43.050 --> 00:13:50.660
things about prey predator systems is
that the prey animals evolved in tandem

00:13:50.660 --> 00:13:50.670
that the prey animals evolved in tandem
 

00:13:50.670 --> 00:13:54.740
that the prey animals evolved in tandem
with the predator animals and they they

00:13:54.740 --> 00:13:54.750
with the predator animals and they they
 

00:13:54.750 --> 00:13:56.600
with the predator animals and they they
expect to be I mean they know what they

00:13:56.600 --> 00:13:56.610
expect to be I mean they know what they
 

00:13:56.610 --> 00:14:00.770
expect to be I mean they know what they
expect to eaten by and the predator

00:14:00.770 --> 00:14:00.780
expect to eaten by and the predator
 

00:14:00.780 --> 00:14:02.570
expect to eaten by and the predator
animals know what the prey animals are

00:14:02.570 --> 00:14:02.580
animals know what the prey animals are
 

00:14:02.580 --> 00:14:04.760
animals know what the prey animals are
and I'm not sure the Cougars knew what

00:14:04.760 --> 00:14:04.770
and I'm not sure the Cougars knew what
 

00:14:04.770 --> 00:14:08.330

the sheep were you know was that

00:14:08.330 --> 00:14:08.340
the sheep were you know was that
 

00:14:08.340 --> 00:14:10.670
the sheep were you know was that
fluffball really edible and would you

00:14:10.670 --> 00:14:10.680
fluffball really edible and would you
 

00:14:10.680 --> 00:14:13.100
fluffball really edible and would you
prefer it but whatever the case either

00:14:13.100 --> 00:14:13.110
prefer it but whatever the case either
 

00:14:13.110 --> 00:14:15.920
prefer it but whatever the case either
because of remarkable efficiency or

00:14:15.920 --> 00:14:15.930
because of remarkable efficiency or
 

00:14:15.930 --> 00:14:17.390
because of remarkable efficiency or
reproduction which i think is part of it

reproduction which i think is part of it
 

00:14:17.400 --> 00:14:20.240

or because the Predators did not pray

00:14:20.240 --> 00:14:20.250

millions of sheep and then you had a
 

00:14:27.840 --> 00:14:30.590

the Sheep died because they had no food
 

00:14:33.150 --> 00:14:36.410
the Sheep died because they had no food
and eaten everything in northern Mexico

00:14:36.410 --> 00:14:36.420
and eaten everything in northern Mexico
 

00:14:36.420 --> 00:14:41.240
and eaten everything in northern Mexico
and then you had a huge die-off and then

00:14:41.240 --> 00:14:41.250
and then you had a huge die-off and then
 

00:14:41.250 --> 00:14:43.400
and then you had a huge die-off and then
you had a gradual rebuilding and then a

you had a gradual rebuilding and then a
 

00:14:43.410 --> 00:14:46.820
you had a gradual rebuilding and then a
sort of equilibrium of that that comes

the problem is that there was no market

the problem is that there was no market

so one of the things that happens is

00:16:16.700 --> 00:16:16.710
so one of the things that happens is
 

00:16:16.710 --> 00:16:22.550
so one of the things that happens is
that these temperate zone areas become

00:33:35.169 --> 00:33:35.179
worshipping a god they see as
 

00:33:35.179 --> 00:33:37.190
worshipping a god they see as
represented by

00:33:37.190 --> 00:33:37.200

00:33:37.200 --> 00:33:41.600

by a cow or by a a donkey or something

by a cow or by a a donkey or something
 

00:33:41.610 --> 00:33:44.650
by a cow or by a a donkey or something
like that

00:33:44.650 --> 00:33:44.660
 
 

00:33:44.660 --> 00:33:47.450
 
initially the use of the animals is

00:33:47.450 --> 00:33:47.460
initially the use of the animals is
 

00:33:47.460 --> 00:33:51.380
initially the use of the animals is
fairly secondary to the imagination to

00:33:51.380 --> 00:33:51.390
fairly secondary to the imagination to
 

00:33:51.390 --> 00:33:54.770
fairly secondary to the imagination to
the imaginary role of the animals but

00:33:54.770 --> 00:33:54.780
the imaginary role of the animals but
 

00:33:54.780 --> 00:33:58.460
the imaginary role of the animals but
over time that relationship reverses and

00:33:58.460 --> 00:33:58.470
over time that relationship reverses and
 

00:33:58.470 --> 00:34:00.830
over time that relationship reverses and
what you get is an increasingly use

00:34:00.830 --> 00:34:00.840
what you get is an increasingly use
 

00:34:00.840 --> 00:34:05.480

00:50:53.410 --> 00:50:55.440
 
now one could say that Russians are

now one could say that Russians are
 

00:50:55.450 --> 00:50:58.769
now one could say that Russians are
Europeans and therefore they have that

00:50:58.769 --> 00:50:58.779
Europeans and therefore they have that
 

00:50:58.779 --> 00:51:00.630
Europeans and therefore they have that
little science gene that all Europeans

now we get a somewhat different story
then because the Europeans are inventing

then because the Europeans are inventing
 

00:53:35.570 --> 00:53:37.390
then because the Europeans are inventing
things then we say what's really

you know we could have done that but you
 

00:53:53.510 --> 00:53:56.230
you know we could have done that but you
know we're too high-minded for that you

lithograph was invented in Europe but
 

00:54:18.710 --> 00:54:21.460

why does capital capital accumulate what
 

00:54:57.170 --> 00:55:01.599
why does capital capital accumulate what
is capital used for and so the story of

00:55:01.599 --> 00:55:01.609
is capital used for and so the story of
 

00:55:01.609 --> 00:55:05.200
is capital used for and so the story of
capitalism starting perhaps with the

17th century has been if you accumulate
the money and if you
