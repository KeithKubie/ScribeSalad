yeah the reason that I thought that she

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:15.560
yeah the reason that I thought that she
 

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:17.250
yeah the reason that I thought that she
was dying from memory is that there are

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:17.260
was dying from memory is that there are
 

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:19.900
was dying from memory is that there are
there's clearly there's probably some

00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:19.910
there's clearly there's probably some
 

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:21.640
there's clearly there's probably some
interaction in between these things

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:21.650
interaction in between these things
 

00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:23.860

which means that they probably speak at

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:26.900
which means that they probably speak at
 

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:29.440
which means that they probably speak at
some point and maybe she's dialing

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:29.450
some point and maybe she's dialing
 

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:30.640
some point and maybe she's dialing
correctly sometimes incorrectly

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:30.650
correctly sometimes incorrectly
 

00:01:30.650 --> 00:01:32.410

clearly hasn't figured out that this

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:33.950
clearly hasn't figured out that this
 

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:36.460
clearly hasn't figured out that this
number doesn't get a response right so

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:36.470
number doesn't get a response right so
 

00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:37.990
number doesn't get a response right so
you're right the interaction kind of

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:38.000
you're right the interaction kind of
 

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:38.620
you're right the interaction kind of
