00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:02.930
So in order to do responsive images right, you need

00:00:02.930 --> 00:00:06.700
to request different images based on the device-pixel ratio, but

00:00:06.700 --> 00:00:10.390
also possibly based on the layout width. These images may

00:00:10.390 --> 00:00:13.900
be the same image simply transcoded to different sizes. But

00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:16.690
they may also be actually different images depending on the

00:00:16.690 --> 00:00:20.640
layout size and how appropriate that layout is. The key

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:23.040
here is to serve the right image to the device

00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:25.880
that needs it. The original of my cat picture here

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:29.580
is a 21 megapixel image. Obviously I probably

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:31.960
don't need to send that to a mobile device.

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:34.690
It has only a half a megapixel display.

00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:36.910
But it helps to start with high quality art.
