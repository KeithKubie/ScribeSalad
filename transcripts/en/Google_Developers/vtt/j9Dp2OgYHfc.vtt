MIKE O'BRIEN: Good
afternoon everybody.

00:00:01.500 --> 00:00:03.620
My name is Mike O'Brien.

00:00:03.620 --> 00:00:06.760
I'm with a company called
Appirio and I'm joined on stage

00:00:06.760 --> 00:00:09.660
today by Adam Graff, from
Genentec, and Matt Pruden,

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:11.740
who is also from Appirio.

00:00:11.740 --> 00:00:13.278
And we are thrilled that you've
joined us today for this Google

00:00:13.278 --> 00:00:17.960
IO2010 enterprise session
called "Extending Google

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:20.698
Apps." And what we're
going to do in this session, is

00:00:20.698 --> 00:00:22.898
we're going to go beyond
the typical Google apps.

00:00:23.478 --> 00:00:26.038
Sort of an implementation of
migrating a customer off of

00:00:26.038 --> 00:00:29.878
Exchange or migrating a
customer off of Lotus Notes,

00:00:29.878 --> 00:00:33.840
and explore what it really
means to extend the platform.

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:35.320
Specifically, we're going
to look at three demos.

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:38.740
Three applications developed by
Appirio and by Genentech and

00:00:38.740 --> 00:00:39.660
we're going to look
under the covers.

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:42.640
We're going to look at the
code, and the API that enabled

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:43.920
these apps to come together.

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:46.380
Also, we're going to look at
the business benefits that

00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:49.520
Genentech is deriving as
a result of these apps.

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:51.860
Also we're going to a
look at a very cool new

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:53.500
Gmail gadget called

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:55.160
PS Connect recently
developed Appirio.

00:00:55.960 --> 00:00:59.580
And, of course, we'll save some
time for Q&amp;A at the end.

00:00:59.580 --> 00:01:01.340
But before we get into all
these topics, we'd like to give

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:05.580
you a little bit of background
on of both Appirio and

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:06.440
Genentech; who we are, what
we're all about so you

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:09.020
kind of sense of how we
approach these topics.

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:10.800
So, let's start there.

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:14.100
Appirio was founed three and a
half, almost 4 years ago, with

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:17.140
a very singular focus of
helping customers move

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:18.380
through the cloud.

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:21.560
You can think of us as a cloud
solution provider whereby we

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:24.120
provide both products and
services to help customers

00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:28.700
implement on Google on
SalesForce and on Amazon.

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:30.660
Then, when we started the
company, we said, hey, let's

00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:33.120
not only do this for our
customers, but let's do

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:35.900
this for ourselves.

00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:37.760
Today we're company of
over 200 employees.

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:38.900
We're in 28 different states.

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:41.098
We're in 3 different
countries and we don't

00:01:41.098 --> 00:01:43.120
own a single server.

00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:44.200
We own lots of laptops,
we even have some

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:47.360
Ipads, but no servers.

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:50.700
About 80% of infrastructure is
on the back of Google,

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:51.800
providing our a messaging and
collaboration layer and

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:59.820
Salesforce, providing our
application and platform layer.

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:03.960
Specifically, from a Google
perspective, we were fortunate

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:05.300
to become a Google Apps
Enterprise Partner

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:06.180
in May of 2007.

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:09.120
And, as such, we've had the
opportunity to work with

00:02:09.120 --> 00:02:13.458
literally dozens and dozens of
medium and large enterprise

00:02:13.458 --> 00:02:14.278
customers who have gone Google.

00:02:14.278 --> 00:02:17.538
And, in fact, we've
participated in 6 of the 10

00:02:17.538 --> 00:02:20.778
largest implementations
to date.

00:02:20.778 --> 00:02:23.398
Those customers you see
here on this slide.

00:02:23.398 --> 00:02:25.578
But, in addition to those
customers who have going

00:02:25.578 --> 00:02:27.458
Google, we've also had the
opportunity to work with a

00:02:27.458 --> 00:02:31.998
number of cutting edge, very
innovative customers like

00:02:31.998 --> 00:02:35.998
Genentech who have truly
extended the platform.

00:02:35.998 --> 00:02:39.160
Who have taken advantage of
incredibly rich and robust

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:42.718
API's that Google has made
available and have customized

00:02:42.718 --> 00:02:45.038
Google apps in a way that
better conforms to their

00:02:45.038 --> 00:02:47.178
business processes.

00:02:47.178 --> 00:02:50.260
So, to those points I'd
like to invite Adam and

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:51.500
Matt to jump in here.

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:53.740
Adam to provide a bit of
background on Genentech and

00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:55.238
to share with us these
very cool demos.

00:02:58.458 --> 00:03:00.958
ADAM GRAFF: Thanks Mike.

00:03:00.958 --> 00:03:01.178
Good afternoon, everyone.

00:03:01.358 --> 00:03:05.860
My name is Adam Graff, and I
manage a very talented team of

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:09.438
software developers and
engineers at Genentech who are

00:03:09.438 --> 00:03:12.038
focused on collaboration tools
and mobile applications

00:03:12.038 --> 00:03:14.398
within our enterprise.

00:03:14.398 --> 00:03:16.798
And, so, just to give you an
idea of who Genentech is,

00:03:16.798 --> 00:03:17.598
in case you don't know.

00:03:18.678 --> 00:03:24.478
Genentech was founded in 1976
by Herb Boyer and Bob Swanson

00:03:24.478 --> 00:03:27.638
as the first biotechnology
company in the world.

00:03:28.378 --> 00:03:31.218
Over the years, since our
founding, we've had a

00:03:31.218 --> 00:03:32.400
lot of great successes.

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:37.478
From our first cloned human
growth hormone drug to the

00:03:37.478 --> 00:03:40.878
latest blockbusters which deal
in the onocology space of

00:03:40.878 --> 00:03:42.220
Avastin, Rituxin,
and Herceptin.

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:49.938
So, oftentimes people ask me or
ask Genentech employees what

00:03:49.938 --> 00:03:51.658
motivate you guys to get up
in the morning go to work?

00:03:51.658 --> 00:03:55.080
And the main thing that
motivates us as the company and

00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:57.538
as a whole and I think you
could ask Genentech employee

00:03:57.538 --> 00:03:59.960
this question, it's
the patients.

00:03:59.960 --> 00:04:04.360
So focusing in on making sure
that we are always identifying

00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:07.780
how our work ties into the
quality of products that we're

00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:11.658
delivering and the lives that
we're saving through our drugs.

00:04:11.658 --> 00:04:12.318
So, how does that relate IT?

00:04:14.398 --> 00:04:16.940
IT embraces this in many ways.

00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:21.560
And the service that we provide
to our end users is an enabling

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:23.840
and academic computing
environment.

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:27.040
So what this means, is we give
as much room as we can to our

00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:30.140
users to be able to choose the
platform they want to be on.

00:04:30.140 --> 00:04:33.238
To choose the tools that they
want to work with, and most

00:04:33.238 --> 00:04:36.278
importantly, give back as much
time as we possibly can,

00:04:36.278 --> 00:04:38.260
through IT and not make things
more complicated than

00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:40.640
they should be.

00:04:40.640 --> 00:04:43.778
So, just to give you an idea of
our environment, to paint a

00:04:43.778 --> 00:04:46.300
story for you, we've got about
40% of our users on Macs.

00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:50.380
We have about 60% of
our users on PC's.

00:04:50.380 --> 00:04:52.920
We got Iphones, we've got
blackberries, we've got a

00:04:52.920 --> 00:04:55.720
handful of Androids out there,
so it's of it's a pretty mixed

00:04:55.720 --> 00:04:56.900
environment that we
have to support.

00:04:56.900 --> 00:05:00.040
And so, we do whatever it
takes, basically, to support

00:05:00.040 --> 00:05:03.898
scientific innovation.

00:05:03.898 --> 00:05:06.778
So, putting that into
perspective, to give you an

00:05:06.778 --> 00:05:08.920
idea of where we are with
Google Apps and kind of where

00:05:08.920 --> 00:05:11.878
we've come from over the
last year and a half.

00:05:11.878 --> 00:05:16.798
Back in 2008, we realized that
we had the big problem on our

00:05:16.798 --> 00:05:20.178
hands to deal with in our email
infrastructure and calendaring

00:05:20.178 --> 00:05:22.000
infrastructure, so we started
looking at different vendors

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:24.958
and the space to figure out
what we're going to do

00:05:24.958 --> 00:05:26.560
to fix the problem.

00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:30.600
And, of course, since we had
such a wide variety of

00:05:30.600 --> 00:05:33.018
platforms we have to support,
whatever we implemented had to

00:05:33.018 --> 00:05:34.358
be able to support that.

00:05:34.358 --> 00:05:37.278
And, that's where Google
came into the picture.

00:05:37.278 --> 00:05:40.700
By enabling us to go to the
web, it got us out of the space

00:05:40.700 --> 00:05:43.840
of having to have thick clients
that were dedicated to Windows

00:05:43.840 --> 00:05:47.438
or Apple Mail or Outlook
and so on and so forth.

00:05:47.438 --> 00:05:52.980
And so, once we came on board
with Google initially with

00:05:52.980 --> 00:05:53.860
Google Calendar first.

00:05:53.860 --> 00:05:55.478
We got through that.

00:05:55.478 --> 00:05:58.298
Migrated off of our existing
system into the cloud, and

00:05:58.298 --> 00:06:00.938
currently were actually
implementing Gmail.

00:06:00.938 --> 00:06:04.138
So, we're migrating about
17,000 users over the course

00:06:04.138 --> 00:06:08.740
of the next 6 months
to the platform.

00:06:08.740 --> 00:06:11.560
So, one of the great things
that we realized once we

00:06:11.560 --> 00:06:15.898
started using Google, is
that you can think it as a

00:06:15.898 --> 00:06:16.178
platform to be extended.

00:06:17.178 --> 00:06:20.160
It's something bigger than just
the products themselves so when

00:06:20.160 --> 00:06:25.600
we started to think about this
and spent some time with it to

00:06:25.600 --> 00:06:31.440
figure out OK what can we do in
terms of developing small tools

00:06:31.440 --> 00:06:34.540
that enable our users to do
unique things; integrate

00:06:34.540 --> 00:06:39.638
between legacy applications, so
for example, keep people in one

00:06:39.638 --> 00:06:43.318
user interface, Gmail, for
example, instead of having to

00:06:43.318 --> 00:06:45.360
flip around between different
applications to get

00:06:45.360 --> 00:06:48.338
the information that
they're looking for.

00:06:48.338 --> 00:06:51.198
So, with Appirio, one of
the first projects that we

00:06:51.198 --> 00:06:56.160
looked at was this, gLinda.

00:06:56.160 --> 00:07:00.800
And, gLinda is a g-talk
bot, so as soon as

00:07:00.800 --> 00:07:04.220
Google released XMPP support,
an app engine, we immediately

00:07:04.220 --> 00:07:05.420
glommed on to that.

00:07:05.420 --> 00:07:08.038
We'd had this idea in the back
of our heads for a while.

00:07:08.398 --> 00:07:12.458
So, it's a g-talk bot, that
basically lives in the Gmail

00:07:12.458 --> 00:07:17.898
interface and from a very high
level, answers questions.

00:07:17.898 --> 00:07:19.758
So, let me paint a
picture for you.

00:07:20.578 --> 00:07:25.680
I'm sitting at my desk writing
an email message and I realized

00:07:25.680 --> 00:07:27.960
in the middle of that email
message this is way too

00:07:27.960 --> 00:07:29.260
complex, I don't want to send
an email, I actually want

00:07:29.260 --> 00:07:30.220
to call the person.

00:07:30.220 --> 00:07:33.698
So what you would normally do
as an end user, is open up a

00:07:33.698 --> 00:07:37.260
new browser or a tab, go to the
coporate directory, look up

00:07:37.260 --> 00:07:41.938
that person's information, and
pick up the phone and call.

00:07:41.938 --> 00:07:46.898
With gLinda, we can actually
ask her who is John Doe?

00:07:46.898 --> 00:07:50.518
And, she will answer back with
that contact information that

00:07:50.518 --> 00:07:52.010
comes from our corporate
directory right in g-talk so

00:07:52.010 --> 00:07:55.360
you no longer have to
leave Gmail to go find

00:07:55.360 --> 00:07:56.758
that information.

00:07:56.758 --> 00:07:59.500
And that's what we tried to do
with all of these different

00:07:59.500 --> 00:08:01.818
questions that we've
set her up to answer.

00:08:01.818 --> 00:08:04.838
So you can search for
information that integrates

00:08:04.838 --> 00:08:07.078
with our Google search
appliance infrastructure that's

00:08:07.078 --> 00:08:09.458
internal to Genentech as
well as Google Search.

00:08:09.980 --> 00:08:12.160
You can ask "WhoIs"
of course to get the corporate

00:08:12.160 --> 00:08:13.658
directory information.

00:08:13.658 --> 00:08:16.338
You can ask "WhereIs"
and that integrates with Google

00:08:16.338 --> 00:08:19.740
Calendar to reply back what
meeting that person may

00:08:19.740 --> 00:08:20.738
be in at that time.

00:08:20.738 --> 00:08:23.238
And then just for fun, we
can run a Magic 8 ball

00:08:23.238 --> 00:08:24.720
question for our users.

00:08:24.720 --> 00:08:28.712
So, I'll turn it over to Matt
now and he'll tell you kind

00:08:28.712 --> 00:08:34.108
of what is on the back end
to enable us to do this.

00:08:44.740 --> 00:08:45.284
MATT PRUDEN: Thanks, Adam.

00:08:46.048 --> 00:08:50.040
Ok, so lets actually flip over
here and talk to gLinda.

00:08:50.040 --> 00:08:50.124
Hello, gLinda.

00:08:50.168 --> 00:08:50.340
Obviously, gLinda's going out.

00:08:50.340 --> 00:08:51.380
She's going to respond to us.

00:08:51.380 --> 00:08:54.080
We can ask her questions.

00:08:54.440 --> 00:08:55.540
I'm not sure where I
am right now, so lets

00:08:55.540 --> 00:08:58.940
just check on me here.

00:08:58.940 --> 00:09:00.960
Where is Matthew here?

00:09:00.960 --> 00:09:03.120
And gLinda is going to go out
and look at my Google calendar.

00:09:03.120 --> 00:09:06.240
It's gonna said, well,
I'm in a meeting.

00:09:06.240 --> 00:09:07.740
I'm giving a demo of Google IO.

00:09:07.840 --> 00:09:15.100
So, okay, well, what is this
Google IO thing? gLinda is

00:09:15.100 --> 00:09:16.420
going to go out and search.

00:09:16.420 --> 00:09:18.800
It's going to say, well, Google
IO, according to Google if I

00:09:18.800 --> 00:09:20.540
click link, it will
tell me all about.

00:09:20.540 --> 00:09:25.880
So, that's a real simple demo
of how this works and the

00:09:25.880 --> 00:09:28.180
whole idea here is that
this is supposed to be fun.

00:09:28.180 --> 00:09:31.320
Right, it's supposed be
interesting and catch on

00:09:31.320 --> 00:09:34.520
so let's just try one
more thing on here.

00:09:34.520 --> 00:09:36.100
Let's try the Magic 8.

00:09:36.100 --> 00:09:40.700
Lets pick on Mike here.

00:09:40.700 --> 00:09:42.620
Will mike's demo that
he's gonna give here

00:09:42.620 --> 00:09:43.000
in a minute succeed?

00:09:45.400 --> 00:09:46.920
Yes, good job Mike.

00:09:46.920 --> 00:09:50.620
That bribe worked.

00:09:50.620 --> 00:09:59.680
So, let's go behind the scenes
and see how this thing works.

00:10:01.038 --> 00:10:01.298
OK,obviously , we know
this is an App engine.

00:10:01.298 --> 00:10:01.538
Adam said this earlier.

00:10:01.538 --> 00:10:07.660
But, did we have to go out look
at 10 different XMPP libraries?

00:10:07.660 --> 00:10:08.300
No.

00:10:08.800 --> 00:10:11.360
Did we have to go to some
enterprise architectural review

00:10:11.360 --> 00:10:14.280
board and get them to buy and
say yes, this passes our

00:10:14.280 --> 00:10:15.240
security audits, and all that?

00:10:15.758 --> 00:10:17.560
No, we didn't have
to do any of that.

00:10:17.340 --> 00:10:21.100
And that's because there's
already a great high-level

00:10:21.100 --> 00:10:24.780
extraction to do XMPP right
out of the box in app engine.

00:10:24.780 --> 00:10:26.100
And here's some example
code that it shows

00:10:26.100 --> 00:10:28.260
just how easy this is.

00:10:28.260 --> 00:10:31.298
There's really 3 things
to keep in mind here.

00:10:31.118 --> 00:10:35.840
First, we're just loading in a
standard Python module here.

00:10:35.840 --> 00:10:39.920
We're extending a class,
Command Handler, in this case.

00:10:39.920 --> 00:10:44.380
We're going in, we're
overriding an existing function

00:10:44.380 --> 00:10:47.340
called "Unhandled"
command and this runs any time

00:10:47.340 --> 00:10:50.900
we just type jiberish
in, this will respond.

00:10:50.900 --> 00:10:53.360
And, if we type something that
really matters, we'll run this

00:10:53.360 --> 00:10:57.760
method called, "Text
Message" and in here, if

00:10:57.760 --> 00:10:59.600
you've written some Python,
you'll notice this is kind of

00:10:59.600 --> 00:11:01.340
standard Python stuff here.

00:11:01.340 --> 00:11:05.278
We've got a familiar dispatch
pattern there in the text

00:11:05.278 --> 00:11:09.120
message method that will go out
and run the Magic 8 function if

00:11:09.120 --> 00:11:10.940
that's what it calls for.

00:11:10.940 --> 00:11:16.120
I guess I should have added
the bride code in there.

00:11:16.120 --> 00:11:18.600
We've got some decorators here.

00:11:18.600 --> 00:11:21.098
We have the oft-required
decorator.

00:11:21.278 --> 00:11:24.820
This is just something we
wrote and let me talk

00:11:24.820 --> 00:11:25.800
about that a minute.

00:11:26.220 --> 00:11:29.500
We obviously want gLinda to
respond to humans, right?

00:11:29.500 --> 00:11:31.180
We don't want gLinda responding
to people she shouldn't

00:11:31.180 --> 00:11:32.660
be responding to.

00:11:32.660 --> 00:11:35.660
People that are in trying
to get information.

00:11:35.660 --> 00:11:39.478
So, because of this very nice
extraction app engine provides,

00:11:39.478 --> 00:11:42.678
we're able to do n number of
validation checks on the

00:11:42.678 --> 00:11:43.760
sender the message.

00:11:43.760 --> 00:11:48.180
So we can go and check,
perhaps, are they a member

00:11:48.180 --> 00:11:49.480
of our Google aps domain?

00:11:49.480 --> 00:11:51.538
Do they exist in our
corporate directory?

00:11:51.940 --> 00:11:53.320
There are a bunch of
things we can do.

00:11:53.320 --> 00:11:55.098
In this case, we do a
lot of those checks.

00:11:55.098 --> 00:11:59.360
We also go and we use other
services of app engine to

00:11:59.360 --> 00:12:02.520
actually send an email to that
user, make sure that they

00:12:02.520 --> 00:12:04.020
receive email, click a link.

00:12:04.020 --> 00:12:05.778
We record that on
the data store.

00:12:05.778 --> 00:12:07.600
We check that on every request.

00:12:08.380 --> 00:12:11.140
These are things that you can
do to just validate that the

00:12:11.140 --> 00:12:16.840
user is someone that should
be receiving these messages.

00:12:16.840 --> 00:12:19.640
Another thing I want to point
out that app engine gives us is

00:12:19.640 --> 00:12:21.680
the whole idea here is we want
this to spread virally, right?

00:12:21.680 --> 00:12:24.320
We want to be fun.

00:12:24.320 --> 00:12:26.860
The downside to doing that, is
there's a good chance we're

00:12:26.860 --> 00:12:31.540
going to go from 100 requests
a day to around 10,000.

00:12:32.880 --> 00:12:35.600
And when we do that it's good
to know that app engine is

00:12:35.600 --> 00:12:38.440
behind the scenes and can
dynamically scale and support

00:12:38.440 --> 00:12:45.138
that kind of load and to get us
those 10,000 users, Adam's

00:12:45.138 --> 00:12:48.638
going to come back and talk
about an application that helps

00:12:48.638 --> 00:12:54.240
people get started
using Google apps.

00:12:54.240 --> 00:12:56.920
ADAM GRAFF: Ok, so I mentioned
earlier that we were in the

00:12:56.920 --> 00:13:04.540
middle of our migration of
users to Gmail At Genentech,

00:13:04.540 --> 00:13:06.538
another the great thing about
working there is that we do

00:13:06.538 --> 00:13:09.838
provide a very high level of
support to our end users and

00:13:09.838 --> 00:13:11.718
for our Gmail migration,
it's no different.

00:13:11.998 --> 00:13:17.360
We decided to form a group of
people who are dedicated to

00:13:17.360 --> 00:13:18.860
providing one-on-one support.

00:13:18.860 --> 00:13:20.000
You can call them up.

00:13:20.640 --> 00:13:23.160
You can schedule them
to come to your desk.

00:13:23.160 --> 00:13:25.660
You can schedule
group training.

00:13:25.660 --> 00:13:27.760
You can schedule web-ex
sessions, however you want to

00:13:27.760 --> 00:13:30.660
get support for you as you're
going through the

00:13:30.660 --> 00:13:31.960
migration period.

00:13:31.960 --> 00:13:33.140
We're available to help.

00:13:33.140 --> 00:13:35.500
And so, when we formed this
group, we realized early on

00:13:35.500 --> 00:13:39.020
that one of the challenges that
we had, was how do we manage

00:13:39.020 --> 00:13:41.240
all of these appointments that
are going to be coming in from

00:13:41.240 --> 00:13:44.900
the 17,000 people that are
going to be migrating over?

00:13:44.900 --> 00:13:47.780
So, at that point, we had a
choice that we could make.

00:13:47.780 --> 00:13:51.058
We could either hire a
coordinator that managed 8

00:13:51.058 --> 00:13:54.320
people schedules and scheduling
all of the meetings in Google

00:13:54.320 --> 00:13:57.860
calendar, or we could approach
this problem from a technical

00:13:57.860 --> 00:13:59.760
perspective and see if we could
find a technical solution.

00:13:59.760 --> 00:14:03.320
And that's exactly what we did
with Appirio and the Google

00:14:03.320 --> 00:14:06.020
apps Concierge tool.

00:14:06.020 --> 00:14:08.440
So, the Google apps Concierge
tool from, again, a very high

00:14:08.440 --> 00:14:14.560
level takes x numbers of
calendars for individual people

00:14:14.560 --> 00:14:17.480
and then aggregates it down
into one view that's presented

00:14:17.480 --> 00:14:20.440
to the end user that you
can then book a time with

00:14:20.440 --> 00:14:21.380
one of the concerieges.

00:14:22.820 --> 00:14:27.780
Then on the concierge side, it
books the time automatically in

00:14:27.780 --> 00:14:31.800
whoever's calendar is free for
that time slot and then

00:14:31.800 --> 00:14:33.940
notified them of the
upcoming appointment.

00:14:34.140 --> 00:14:38.798
This has been a great tool for
us because it gives our end

00:14:38.798 --> 00:14:42.038
users the ability to control
when they want to receive

00:14:42.038 --> 00:14:46.000
support it very easy for them
and gives that gives them

00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:49.220
the opportunity to get the
support that they need.

00:14:49.220 --> 00:15:02.840
So, I'll turn it over to Matt
again to look at the back end.

00:15:02.840 --> 00:15:06.900
MATT PRUDEN: Let's see if I can
shrink this down a little bit.

00:15:06.900 --> 00:15:07.660
Ok, so this is the application.

00:15:07.660 --> 00:15:12.620
You'll see this looks very much
like a very simple web app.

00:15:12.620 --> 00:15:13.520
It modern.

00:15:13.740 --> 00:15:15.880
It has the rounded corners,
and all the things

00:15:15.880 --> 00:15:16.040
you would expect.

00:15:16.040 --> 00:15:20.178
The idea here is that this
should be extremely simple;

00:15:20.178 --> 00:15:21.240
kind of one click.

00:15:21.240 --> 00:15:24.420
Get access to a concierge, book
your appointment, get the help

00:15:24.420 --> 00:15:26.980
you need and get on
with your day job.

00:15:27.440 --> 00:15:29.740
I'm not spend a lot of time
walking through this just

00:15:29.740 --> 00:15:30.980
cuz there's not much to it.

00:15:30.980 --> 00:15:32.920
You click a button, you
type in your information

00:15:32.920 --> 00:15:34.420
and you're done.

00:15:34.420 --> 00:15:37.320
So let me go back to the slides
and show how this works.

00:15:40.960 --> 00:15:43.340
As you can tell by the image
here this is app engine again

00:15:43.340 --> 00:15:44.400
except this time it's
the Java Runtime.

00:15:46.600 --> 00:15:49.940
And, specifically here's some
code from there, and I was

00:15:49.940 --> 00:15:53.920
going to ask the audience here,
what's interesting about it?

00:15:53.920 --> 00:15:57.820
And looking at that, I think
the answer is, there's nothing

00:15:57.820 --> 00:15:59.800
interesting about that code.

00:15:59.800 --> 00:16:00.820
Nothing at all.

00:16:00.900 --> 00:16:04.160
I think oftentimes we overlook
the fact a conference like this

00:16:04.160 --> 00:16:08.920
or when we're getting blasted
with all this new technology

00:16:08.920 --> 00:16:11.540
that if we have skills that
we've acquired or master over

00:16:11.540 --> 00:16:15.300
10 or 15 years like doing
HTML and JSP pages.

00:16:15.300 --> 00:16:16.820
We don't have to learn
a lot of new stuff.

00:16:16.820 --> 00:16:19.280
We can take that and
immediately began

00:16:19.280 --> 00:16:21.760
and start using it.

00:16:21.760 --> 00:16:22.100
And that's exactly
what we had here.

00:16:22.100 --> 00:16:24.940
We had experience designers.

00:16:24.940 --> 00:16:27.390
We have people that are
used to looking at these

00:16:27.390 --> 00:16:28.740
tags in their HTML.

00:16:28.140 --> 00:16:32.020
We have people that knew JSP,
and they could begin and use

00:16:32.020 --> 00:16:34.940
those skills on app engine,
without having to learn Glib.

00:16:34.940 --> 00:16:40.180
Although would probably been
a lot more interesting.

00:16:40.180 --> 00:16:43.560
Another thing to point out here
is, they didn't even learn a

00:16:43.560 --> 00:16:46.040
lot of data source stuff
for this application.

00:16:46.040 --> 00:16:48.880
And the reason is because,
Genentech, like a lot of

00:16:48.880 --> 00:16:51.160
enterprises, has invested in
their enterprise service plus

00:16:51.160 --> 00:16:54.580
infrastructure and we were
able to just reuse that

00:16:54.580 --> 00:16:56.040
investment from App Engine.

00:16:56.040 --> 00:17:01.178
Here we are using the same
java classes that people are

00:17:01.178 --> 00:17:04.800
familiar with to do HTPP
communication and that's

00:17:04.800 --> 00:17:05.580
exactly what we're doing here.

00:17:05.580 --> 00:17:07.178
We're getting JSON on
back from their ESP.

00:17:08.620 --> 00:17:10.760
That actually would
be interesting talk

00:17:10.760 --> 00:17:11.098
in and of itself.

00:17:11.098 --> 00:17:14.150
It talks out to Google Calendar
and a lot of other systems in

00:17:14.150 --> 00:17:17.080
order to check calendar
availability and book

00:17:17.080 --> 00:17:18.800
calendar appointments.

00:17:18.460 --> 00:17:19.860
That's all there is to it.

00:17:19.860 --> 00:17:23.520
I think that the whole point
here is that although as

00:17:23.520 --> 00:17:25.940
developers, we all wish we
could learn new stuff every

00:17:25.940 --> 00:17:28.260
day, a lot of times
it's not realistic.

00:17:28.260 --> 00:17:29.660
It's not the right thing to do.

00:17:29.660 --> 00:17:31.840
So, if you already have those
skills that you've learned

00:17:31.840 --> 00:17:34.040
over 15 years, feel free to
bring to bear in AppEngine.

00:17:34.120 --> 00:17:34.760
Adam.

00:17:34.760 --> 00:17:45.180
ADAM GRAFF: OK, so just
extrapolate a little further on

00:17:45.180 --> 00:17:47.420
Matt's comment around our
investment in our enterprise

00:17:47.420 --> 00:17:51.300
service bus architecture, so in
general, when we are

00:17:51.300 --> 00:17:58.720
implementing on the Google
platform, we do try and

00:17:58.720 --> 00:18:02.460
implement or tie into Google's
API's with our enterprise

00:18:02.460 --> 00:18:04.960
service bus and then expose
those as web services.

00:18:04.960 --> 00:18:08.780
And that gives us a couple of
advantages from a couple of

00:18:08.780 --> 00:18:09.940
different perspectives,
because then we can

00:18:09.940 --> 00:18:10.720
reuse those services.

00:18:10.720 --> 00:18:14.300
So, some of the same services
that we developed for

00:18:14.300 --> 00:18:20.820
gLinda were reused in the
concierge app as well.

00:18:20.860 --> 00:18:24.380
And we're seeing that
throughout the enterprises as

00:18:24.380 --> 00:18:26.880
both recognition of the
platform's capabilities grow

00:18:26.880 --> 00:18:30.100
and then as people are starting
to pick up and do more

00:18:30.100 --> 00:18:31.080
implementations on it.

00:18:31.080 --> 00:18:35.920
So this next the integration is
one of the more interesting

00:18:35.920 --> 00:18:38.340
ones that we've done over the
course of the last year for a

00:18:38.340 --> 00:18:39.280
couple of different reasons.

00:18:39.280 --> 00:18:43.078
So I mentioned earlier that one
of the goals of our team is to

00:18:43.078 --> 00:18:46.058
give time back to our employees
to make sure that they're

00:18:46.058 --> 00:18:48.920
focused on the work that
they're there to do and

00:18:48.920 --> 00:18:51.340
make their jobs easier.

00:18:51.340 --> 00:18:53.740
So, at Genentech, we
obviously use Google Apps.

00:18:54.280 --> 00:19:00.780
we also sales force.com so
we've got 2 major pieces of our

00:19:00.780 --> 00:19:01.720
infrastructure in the cloud.

00:19:01.720 --> 00:19:05.080
And one of the pieces of
feedback that we got from are

00:19:05.080 --> 00:19:07.820
sales force, our commercial
organization, was that

00:19:07.820 --> 00:19:10.740
they're having to manage
too many calendars.

00:19:10.740 --> 00:19:15.038
So, day in the life of, if I'm
a sales person, I've got to

00:19:15.038 --> 00:19:18.720
wake up in the morning, look at
my personal Google calendar,

00:19:18.720 --> 00:19:20.900
check my meetings and
appointments there with

00:19:20.900 --> 00:19:23.460
my colleagues at work.

00:19:23.460 --> 00:19:26.740
Then you've got team calendars
in addition to that, that have

00:19:26.740 --> 00:19:28.410
all kinds of events that
the people are managing so

00:19:28.410 --> 00:19:29.960
you've gotta check that.

00:19:29.960 --> 00:19:34.420
And then you got to switch over
again to Salesforce.com and

00:19:34.420 --> 00:19:37.260
then look at your Salesforce
calendar and figure out, what

00:19:37.260 --> 00:19:41.618
are my appointments with
doctors and with health care

00:19:41.618 --> 00:19:42.798
professionals and so
on and so forth.

00:19:42.798 --> 00:19:48.700
So, our sales folks are
managing 3 possibly even the up

00:19:48.700 --> 00:19:51.460
to 10 different calendars to
figure out what they needed

00:19:51.460 --> 00:19:54.440
to do in their day.

00:19:54.440 --> 00:19:55.240
So, big problem.

00:19:55.240 --> 00:20:00.140
With the unified calendar, what
we were able to do was, because

00:20:00.140 --> 00:20:02.960
of the open standards and open
nature of both Salesforce and

00:20:02.960 --> 00:20:08.620
Google is take Salesforce, the
calendar in Salesforce and

00:20:08.620 --> 00:20:12.700
bring it in and funnel it down
into one view in

00:20:12.700 --> 00:20:13.440
Google Calendar.

00:20:13.440 --> 00:20:16.980
So now our sales force
team has one place to go.

00:20:16.980 --> 00:20:19.880
All of their appointments show
in one screen and then they

00:20:19.880 --> 00:20:24.340
also have the ability to manage
their events and subscribe to

00:20:24.340 --> 00:20:26.260
events that they're interested
in, like educational series

00:20:26.260 --> 00:20:31.760
about new drugs or new ways to
present information to doctors

00:20:31.760 --> 00:20:34.040
based on FDA regulations
and so on and so forth.

00:20:34.040 --> 00:20:40.440
So, I'll hand it
back to Matt again.

00:20:40.440 --> 00:20:41.740
MATT PRUDEN: As you
might guess, now

00:20:41.740 --> 00:20:42.000
going to give a demo!

00:20:53.140 --> 00:20:58.160
Like Adam said, this is a very
big application and we could

00:20:58.160 --> 00:21:01.280
easily spend 8 hours going into
the nuts and bolts of how this

00:21:01.280 --> 00:21:04.600
whole thing works and anyone
that's done calendar

00:21:04.600 --> 00:21:07.180
syncronization knows
what I'm talking about.

00:21:07.180 --> 00:21:12.540
So what I'm going to focus on
today is just one part of this

00:21:12.540 --> 00:21:16.318
and the piece that I think that
most applies to the audience

00:21:16.318 --> 00:21:23.560
here and that is this Google
gadget over here on the right.

00:21:23.560 --> 00:21:25.960
In order to kind of explain
what we should be looking at

00:21:25.960 --> 00:21:31.820
here, let me talk a little
bit about the business case.

00:21:31.820 --> 00:21:34.320
As a user of Google Calendar,
here I'm going to have a lot

00:21:34.320 --> 00:21:36.160
of appointments every day.

00:21:36.160 --> 00:21:39.440
Some of these are
personal appointments.

00:21:39.440 --> 00:21:42.000
Some of them are meetings
people have booked with me but

00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:43.700
others live in Salesforce.

00:21:44.200 --> 00:21:47.118
The system of record of those
lives in Salesforce and those

00:21:47.118 --> 00:21:49.098
are behind the scenes
synchronized and they show up

00:21:49.098 --> 00:21:53.880
on my calendar and these are
what we call interactions.

00:21:53.880 --> 00:21:59.780
An interaction, in this case,
is just a meeting with someone

00:21:59.780 --> 00:22:02.020
in the medical industry about a
Genentech product or

00:22:02.020 --> 00:22:04.358
a Genentech event or
something like that.

00:22:04.358 --> 00:22:06.680
So, we have a couple
of those here.

00:22:06.680 --> 00:22:09.860
You see I've got one at
noon today, or I had

00:22:09.860 --> 00:22:10.958
one at noon today.

00:22:10.958 --> 00:22:13.060
I've got another one at
5:00 today and these

00:22:13.060 --> 00:22:14.660
are calls with people.

00:22:14.660 --> 00:22:16.900
And once again, these
live in Salesforce.

00:22:17.260 --> 00:22:20.060
This is where they were created
and then magically, they were

00:22:20.060 --> 00:22:23.540
pushed through the enterprise
service bus right

00:22:23.540 --> 00:22:26.300
here to my calendar.

00:22:26.300 --> 00:22:29.760
So, what we have is this gadget
and what it does is it shows

00:22:29.760 --> 00:22:32.358
all of the interactions, all
those special events that are

00:22:32.358 --> 00:22:34.200
on my calendar that are
visible right now.

00:22:34.200 --> 00:22:36.920
You can see there's 2,
so there's 2 showing

00:22:36.920 --> 00:22:39.320
up right here.

00:22:39.320 --> 00:22:44.380
Let me go to just go to the
week view so now I'm seeing

00:22:44.380 --> 00:22:46.580
more my calendar and the
interaction that load up up and

00:22:46.580 --> 00:22:49.118
now I'm looking at it 3
difference interactions because

00:22:49.118 --> 00:22:52.658
I can see 3; the 2 that are
today and the 1 at 1:00 p.m.

00:22:52.658 --> 00:22:52.978
Tomorrow.

00:22:55.520 --> 00:22:59.340
So when I use this gadget, the
idea is that I can click

00:22:59.340 --> 00:23:01.320
directly from my Google
calendar and go back to sales

00:23:01.320 --> 00:23:04.220
force to look at interesting
things about the interaction.

00:23:04.220 --> 00:23:06.000
I can look at the account,
I can look at the

00:23:06.000 --> 00:23:06.620
interaction itself.

00:23:07.200 --> 00:23:08.840
I'm not going to go
through that right now.

00:23:08.060 --> 00:23:11.420
I'm just going to
focus on the gadget.

00:23:11.420 --> 00:23:14.240
The other thing you'll
notice is I have a second

00:23:14.240 --> 00:23:15.440
calendar over here called
commercial events.

00:23:16.580 --> 00:23:19.980
And these are events that I
personally find interesting.

00:23:19.980 --> 00:23:24.240
I go into Salesforce, I select
a bunch of criteria, things

00:23:24.240 --> 00:23:27.960
that are interesting to me, and
then out a potentially

00:23:27.960 --> 00:23:31.838
thousands of events, Salesforce
will figure out the events that

00:23:31.838 --> 00:23:34.118
interest me and it'll push them
to this special calendar

00:23:34.118 --> 00:23:36.920
that's unique to me.

00:23:36.920 --> 00:23:40.640
And whenever this calendar is
visible, I have a link at the

00:23:40.640 --> 00:23:42.260
bottom of the gadget that
says, edit my commercial

00:23:42.260 --> 00:23:43.920
event preferences.

00:23:43.118 --> 00:23:46.400
This is where I would go and
say, OK, now I'm only

00:23:46.400 --> 00:23:48.998
interested in events related
to this particular product,

00:23:48.998 --> 00:23:51.260
or that product or
something like that.

00:23:51.060 --> 00:23:53.720
One thing that I want to point
out that's important when

00:23:53.720 --> 00:23:56.360
you're designing a gadget, is
that there's limited screen

00:23:56.360 --> 00:24:00.560
real estate here, so if I'm not
viewing that calendar if you'll

00:24:00.560 --> 00:24:04.860
pay attention to the gadget
when I de-select that

00:24:04.860 --> 00:24:11.440
hopefully, the gadget should
respond and hide that.

00:24:11.440 --> 00:24:14.140
Exactly like it's not doing!

00:24:14.140 --> 00:24:18.140
So, imagine a nice fade
of that disappearing.

00:24:18.140 --> 00:24:21.800
Let's try that again.
490
00:24:21,8 --&gt; 00:24:21,22
Ah, there we go.

00:24:24.360 --> 00:24:26.420
And that's something to keep
in mind when you're writing

00:24:26.420 --> 00:24:28.880
gadgets, is respect the
user's screen real estate.

00:24:28.880 --> 00:24:29.740
There's not a lot there.

00:24:29.740 --> 00:24:31.180
They may have other gadgets.

00:24:31.180 --> 00:24:33.120
If you're hogging all the
space, they're going to

00:24:33.120 --> 00:24:35.120
get rid of your gadget,
so keep that in mind.

00:24:35.120 --> 00:24:44.940
OK, let me switch
over to some code.

00:24:44.940 --> 00:24:46.840
Before I show the code
though,let me just emphasize

00:24:46.840 --> 00:24:49.880
this is kind of a merger of
equals, this application here.

00:24:49.880 --> 00:24:53.618
It's kind of equal parts Sales
force being the system of

00:24:53.618 --> 00:24:58.160
record, equal part Google being
the user interface and then

00:24:58.160 --> 00:25:00.598
equal part all the glue that
makes it works, and thats

00:25:00.598 --> 00:25:01.220
the enterprise service bus.

00:25:03.900 --> 00:25:07.120
The first little code snippette
that I want to talk about is

00:25:07.120 --> 00:25:12.118
really what orchestrates the
entire gadget and this is the

00:25:12.118 --> 00:25:15.038
standard kind of calendar
sidebar API that you use.

00:25:15.038 --> 00:25:16.140
This is all Javascript.

00:25:17.900 --> 00:25:21.800
And what we're doing here is
any time the user changes the

00:25:21.800 --> 00:25:24.840
visible number of events they
are seeing, if they're looking

00:25:24.840 --> 00:25:26.858
at day and they go to the
week view like I did, then

00:25:26.858 --> 00:25:28.598
this subscribe to dates
function's going to run.

00:25:28.598 --> 00:25:29.958
It's going a call back.

00:25:29.838 --> 00:25:33.420
In this case, got dates, and
this starts the gadget.

00:25:35.920 --> 00:25:37.760
So, now we have the dates.

00:25:37.760 --> 00:25:40.120
Now we need go and ask Google
to get us all the events

00:25:40.120 --> 00:25:42.000
for that date range.

00:25:42.000 --> 00:25:44.020
And this is an important
pattern you'll see.

00:25:44.860 --> 00:25:48.518
It's not is well-documented as
I think it should be, but it's

00:25:48.518 --> 00:25:50.858
something that it once you get
the hang of it, it really

00:25:50.858 --> 00:25:52.220
makes writing gadgets easier.

00:25:52.220 --> 00:25:58.180
And that is always assume that
the user isn't authorize.

00:25:58.180 --> 00:25:59.760
So we're going to go we're
going to ask Google, hey

00:25:59.760 --> 00:26:01.060
give me a bunch of events.

00:26:01.060 --> 00:26:04.720
Most people would say, well
before we do that, we need to

00:26:04.720 --> 00:26:05.740
authorize the user to make
sure they have access

00:26:05.740 --> 00:26:07.260
to these events.

00:26:07.260 --> 00:26:09.140
But it turns out that's
actually not the best way

00:26:09.140 --> 00:26:12.540
to do it because we're
using 3 [? leg go ?]

00:26:12.540 --> 00:26:15.120
auth here, and the user could
revoke the token at any time,

00:26:15.120 --> 00:26:17.260
and we're not guaranteed this
is going to succeed so let's

00:26:17.260 --> 00:26:20.058
just go ahead and try
to get it anyway.

00:26:20.058 --> 00:26:24.160
And if you haven't seen code
like this, asynchronous

00:26:24.160 --> 00:26:26.640
Javascript like this, the way
to read it is to just

00:26:26.640 --> 00:26:27.760
start at the bottom.

00:26:27.760 --> 00:26:29.140
We're going to ask the
calendar, to give

00:26:29.140 --> 00:26:30.618
us all the events.

00:26:30.618 --> 00:26:32.618
That's either going to succeed
or it's going to fail.

00:26:32.618 --> 00:26:34.778
If it succeeds, great.

00:26:34.778 --> 00:26:35.940
We got the events.

00:26:35.940 --> 00:26:39.700
Run the display event function
or method right here.

00:26:39.700 --> 00:26:43.340
If it failed, and it failed
because we weren't authorized

00:26:43.340 --> 00:26:48.400
to run this fictious method
here that I put in just to make

00:26:48.400 --> 00:26:50.000
it so there's less code on the
screen here then authorize me

00:26:50.000 --> 00:26:54.280
and this would do the normal
OAuth dance and ask which

00:26:54.280 --> 00:26:56.900
account do you want to use to
authorize and all that stuff.

00:26:56.900 --> 00:27:01.620
This code actually uses the
Shindig library from Apache

00:27:01.620 --> 00:27:02.340
to automate all this stuff.

00:27:02.340 --> 00:27:04.200
It's really clean.

00:27:04.200 --> 00:27:08.000
And after we do that, then we
just call the same method again

00:27:08.000 --> 00:27:12.280
and this kind of very simple
recursion makes authorization

00:27:12.280 --> 00:27:15.578
with OAuth very, very easy.

00:27:15.578 --> 00:27:18.240
OK, so now we've got events,
we're authorized, excuse me,

00:27:18.240 --> 00:27:21.060
we've got an event feed from
Google were authorized.

00:27:21.980 --> 00:27:26.740
Now, let's display the
events on the screen.

00:27:26.740 --> 00:27:30.280
To do that, we need to identify
out of potentially hundreds of

00:27:30.280 --> 00:27:33.380
events that were returned,
which ones are interactions?

00:27:33.380 --> 00:27:35.780
And sure, we could do that by
looking at the subject and

00:27:35.780 --> 00:27:38.100
trying to say well, if the
subject looks this way, then

00:27:38.100 --> 00:27:41.800
it's probably an event that was
pushed from Salesforce, but the

00:27:41.800 --> 00:27:45.098
user could always change the
subject and that would lead to

00:27:45.098 --> 00:27:48.880
a bug down the road so that's
not the right thing to do.

00:27:48.880 --> 00:27:50.740
So, instead, we use something
that's often overlooked.

00:27:50.740 --> 00:27:53.880
And, it's extended properties.

00:27:53.880 --> 00:27:56.400
And this is a standard
feature of the calendar API.

00:27:56.400 --> 00:28:00.018
Any event can have arbitrary
name value pairs attached to it

00:28:00.018 --> 00:28:01.418
and that's what we do here.

00:28:01.418 --> 00:28:04.220
So whenever Salesforce, through
the ESB, creates these

00:28:04.220 --> 00:28:06.660
events, we add a bunch of
extended property to it.

00:28:06.660 --> 00:28:08.960
The user has no idea
those are there.

00:28:08.960 --> 00:28:11.498
They can't change them, but we,
the programmer can, and we can

00:28:11.498 --> 00:28:12.780
look at them so that's
what we do here.

00:28:13.640 --> 00:28:15.780
We just loop through
every event in the feed.

00:28:15.780 --> 00:28:17.420
If it has certain extended
properties, then we know

00:28:17.420 --> 00:28:18.200
it came from Salesforce.

00:28:19.220 --> 00:28:20.260
We know it's an interaction.

00:28:20.260 --> 00:28:24.558
We know we should display
it in the gadget.

00:28:24.558 --> 00:28:27.420
So, with that I'm going to
hand it back to Mike and

00:28:27.420 --> 00:28:31.220
he's gonna talk more
about some gadget work.

00:28:31.220 --> 00:28:32.292
Thank you Matt.

00:28:32.364 --> 00:28:32.580
Thank you Adam.

00:28:33.660 --> 00:28:39.760
Lets hope that the the Magic 8
Ball predicted accurately and

00:28:39.760 --> 00:28:41.740
this last demo works smoothly.

00:28:41.740 --> 00:28:44.720
We'll find out.

00:28:44.720 --> 00:28:46.838
Imagine, if you will, what it
would be like to run your

00:28:46.838 --> 00:28:50.360
entire business in the cloud.

00:28:50.360 --> 00:28:53.618
Gartner tells us that 1 out
of 5 companies, 20% of the

00:28:53.618 --> 00:28:54.220
companies are going to do this.

00:28:54.220 --> 00:28:56.920
They're going to be
server-less by the year 2012.

00:28:57.460 --> 00:28:59.400
Appirio doesn't only do this
for our customers, we actually

00:28:59.400 --> 00:29:00.880
do it for ourselves.

00:29:00.880 --> 00:29:03.840
That's how we run our business
and now with Gmail contentual

00:29:03.840 --> 00:29:07.880
gadgets and a new product from
Appirio called PS Connect, you

00:29:07.880 --> 00:29:09.640
can do all of that directly
within Google Apps.

00:29:09.038 --> 00:29:15.700
Let me show you how.

00:29:15.700 --> 00:29:18.860
So for this demo, let's assume
I run our services organization

00:29:18.860 --> 00:29:21.280
and do so, I need a lot of
powerful enterprise

00:29:21.280 --> 00:29:23.740
applications.

00:29:23.740 --> 00:29:26.140
I need to be able to manage
my people, my projects, my

00:29:26.140 --> 00:29:27.958
customers, my financials.

00:29:27.958 --> 00:29:30.778
And to do so, I need a
lot of powerful apps.

00:29:30.778 --> 00:29:33.540
I use apps all the cloud.

00:29:33.540 --> 00:29:38.980
I use Salesforce.com to manage
my leads and my opportunities.

00:29:38.980 --> 00:29:42.318
I use a force.com application
called PS Enterprise to manage

00:29:42.318 --> 00:29:44.520
my projects and my resources.

00:29:44.520 --> 00:29:46.040
So you can see I've got
a lot of information

00:29:46.040 --> 00:29:47.980
out there, right?

00:29:47.980 --> 00:29:50.900
That's all necessary to run my
business, but unfortunately

00:29:50.900 --> 00:29:53.260
this isn't where
I spend my day.

00:29:53.260 --> 00:29:54.680
This is.

00:29:55.020 --> 00:29:57.338
This is where I make dozens and
dozens of decisions throughout

00:29:57.338 --> 00:30:00.160
the day that affect my
operations, but I do so without

00:30:00.160 --> 00:30:02.940
the benefit of all that
information thats locked

00:30:02.940 --> 00:30:07.480
up in the cloud.

00:30:07.480 --> 00:30:12.038
But now, with Gmail contextual
gadgets and PS Connect, I

00:30:12.038 --> 00:30:13.520
can do that within my email.

00:30:13.520 --> 00:30:14.300
Let me show you how I do that.

00:30:14.300 --> 00:30:17.480
So when I start my day, I
typically will zero in on

00:30:17.480 --> 00:30:18.980
customer related emails.

00:30:19.500 --> 00:30:20.280
Here's one from Carl Customer.

00:30:21.840 --> 00:30:24.040
This one looks like Carl
wants to go to lunch.

00:30:24.040 --> 00:30:27.600
Well I'm not typical going
to prioritize this.

00:30:27.600 --> 00:30:29.260
It doesn't seem very urgent.

00:30:29.260 --> 00:30:31.750
Certainly I'm not to go out to
my CRM System and see what kind

00:30:31.750 --> 00:30:34.500
of projects and opportunities
we have open with this

00:30:34.500 --> 00:30:35.540
particular customer.

00:30:35.540 --> 00:30:36.280
But, you know what?

00:30:36.280 --> 00:30:38.000
That would be a mistake,
because look down here.

00:30:38.000 --> 00:30:41.380
At the bottom of this email, is
a new Gmail contextual gadget

00:30:41.380 --> 00:30:45.260
called PS Connect that's
gone out to my enterprise

00:30:45.260 --> 00:30:48.308
applications and gathered all
the relevent information and

00:30:48.308 --> 00:30:49.400
displayed it to me here.

00:30:49.400 --> 00:30:51.320
So, of course, I've got
contact information and such.

00:30:51.320 --> 00:30:51.940
But look.

00:30:51.940 --> 00:30:55.280
I've got 7 opportunities in
my CRM system open with

00:30:55.280 --> 00:30:56.500
this particular customer.

00:30:56.500 --> 00:30:59.480
One of them here happens
to be related to this

00:30:59.480 --> 00:31:00.020
particular email.

00:31:00.680 --> 00:31:03.140
It's the office relocation
which happens to be on

00:31:03.140 --> 00:31:04.400
hold, but guess what?

00:31:04.400 --> 00:31:06.780
I just learned from this
particular email that the

00:31:06.780 --> 00:31:09.940
New York office move is
complete, so I can now

00:31:09.940 --> 00:31:11.620
take action directly
from within this email.

00:31:12.020 --> 00:31:16.490
I can change the stage from
prospecting to qualified and

00:31:16.490 --> 00:31:18.880
that automatically
gets updated.

00:31:18.880 --> 00:31:22.250
I can add this record to my CRM
system so the entire account

00:31:22.250 --> 00:31:24.240
team can see what's going on.

00:31:24.240 --> 00:31:26.260
And, I typically wouldn't have
done either of those two things

00:31:26.260 --> 00:31:29.660
until the night before the
sales call, but because I've

00:31:29.660 --> 00:31:33.180
now done them, and I've
informed my sales team what's

00:31:33.180 --> 00:31:35.680
going on, I can go ahead and
appropriately response to this

00:31:35.680 --> 00:31:40.680
customer and say sounds great.

00:31:40.180 --> 00:31:45.340
Looking forward to
lunch next week.

00:31:45.340 --> 00:31:46.640
So far, so good.

00:31:46.640 --> 00:31:48.640
So I'm going back to my inbox
and look at the next email.

00:31:48.640 --> 00:31:52.160
Izzy Impatience.

00:31:52.160 --> 00:31:54.400
This is from a customer that
doesn't look to be too happy.

00:31:54.400 --> 00:31:57.640
It looks like his
project is off track.

00:31:57.640 --> 00:32:01.440
Now, typically this would
just set off a flurry of

00:32:01.440 --> 00:32:02.400
activity in my company.

00:32:03.460 --> 00:32:04.880
Who's project is this?

00:32:04.880 --> 00:32:05.400
What's the status?

00:32:05.400 --> 00:32:06.318
What are we doing about it?

00:32:06.318 --> 00:32:07.320
One big fire drill, right?

00:32:07.320 --> 00:32:07.940
You know what?

00:32:07.940 --> 00:32:11.340
All of this information
is probably within my

00:32:11.340 --> 00:32:12.260
PS Enterprise system.

00:32:12.260 --> 00:32:16.060
And PS Connect has brought that
information back to me here.

00:32:16.060 --> 00:32:18.660
So I can see this customer
happens to have 3 projects

00:32:18.660 --> 00:32:20.640
open. 2 of them are
in green status.

00:32:21.460 --> 00:32:23.420
One of them happens
to be in red.

00:32:23.420 --> 00:32:25.260
That's probably the one
he's talking about here.

00:32:25.260 --> 00:32:26.360
Implementation.

00:32:26.660 --> 00:32:28.760
I see a note from the project
manager that says the

00:32:28.760 --> 00:32:31.260
schedule will slip unless an
architect is extended.

00:32:31.260 --> 00:32:32.140
So you know what?

00:32:32.140 --> 00:32:35.640
I'm familiar enough with my
project, with the staffing

00:32:35.640 --> 00:32:38.298
situation, that I can go ahead
and an extended resource.
680
00:32:38,298 --&gt; 00:32:38,14
But you know what?

00:32:38.140 --> 00:32:41.440
Is that a smart thing to do?

00:32:41.440 --> 00:32:42.838
Additionally, I have more
information here that

00:32:42.838 --> 00:32:44.720
says this project has
plenty of budget left.

00:32:44.720 --> 00:32:46.900
I've got over $600,000
so you know what?

00:32:46.900 --> 00:32:50.078
I'm going to go ahead and
inform my staffing team that

00:32:50.078 --> 00:32:52.440
we're extending this resource
and I'm going to respond to

00:32:52.440 --> 00:32:55.260
Scott to say, hey the resource
has been extended, and

00:32:55.260 --> 00:32:58.920
he's going to be thrilled.

00:32:58.920 --> 00:33:02.380
So, you can see by running your
entire business in the cloud,

00:33:02.380 --> 00:33:04.940
it's a vastly different
experience, right?

00:33:04.940 --> 00:33:06.640
You have the ability to go out
to your enterprise systems

00:33:06.640 --> 00:33:10.580
aggregate all that information
and directly within Google Apps

00:33:10.580 --> 00:33:12.460
again thanks to Gmail
contextual gadgets

00:33:12.460 --> 00:33:13.660
and PS Connect.

00:33:14.920 --> 00:33:19.920
Ok, so that is the
end of our demos.

00:33:19.920 --> 00:33:22.200
I'm going to transition
back over to here and

00:33:22.200 --> 00:33:23.780
open up to Q&amp;A.

00:33:23.780 --> 00:33:26.600
We obviously talked about 3
gadgets, three demos that we

00:33:26.600 --> 00:33:33.358
developed Genentech and the
one here developed by Appirio

00:33:33.358 --> 00:33:40.220
and we want to open up to
questions for any of those.

00:33:40.220 --> 00:33:43.820
There must be some questions.

00:33:43.820 --> 00:33:44.940
Come on, you can ask
some tough ones!

00:33:44.940 --> 00:33:48.240
There are developers and
engineers in the room from both

00:33:48.240 --> 00:33:50.900
Appirio and Genentech who have
worked on some of

00:33:50.900 --> 00:33:51.340
these projects.

00:33:51.340 --> 00:33:52.740
If you would just step up
to the microphone so that

00:33:52.740 --> 00:33:55.540
everyone can hear you?

00:33:55.540 --> 00:33:57.700
AUDIENCE: So, what's next?

00:33:57.700 --> 00:34:00.480
What do you have in mind as
far as the next enterprise

00:34:00.480 --> 00:34:02.940
applications that you could
build on top of Google Apps,

00:34:02.940 --> 00:34:06.100
using the API's and utilize
within Genentech or Appirio?

00:34:07.680 --> 00:34:08.380
MATT PRUDEN: Yeah,
great questions.

00:34:09.198 --> 00:34:13.718
We see tons of opportunities
to continue to move

00:34:13.718 --> 00:34:16.118
functionality to the cloud.

00:34:16.118 --> 00:34:18.658
Google continues to offer
richer and richer API's

00:34:18.658 --> 00:34:20.378
that makes that possible.

00:34:20.298 --> 00:34:24.678
You know anything that you see
happening behind the firewall

00:34:24.678 --> 00:34:30.940
today, whether it's single sign
on or directory service as

00:34:30.940 --> 00:34:34.298
examples, those are things that
could be taken out to the cloud

00:34:34.298 --> 00:34:39.438
and become part of not your
network behind the firewall but

00:34:39.438 --> 00:34:42.538
your network in the cloud and
we see Google continuing to

00:34:42.538 --> 00:34:46.878
make advances in those areas to
make things like that possible.

00:34:46.878 --> 00:34:48.028
ADAM GRAFF: Mike and
I can actually add a

00:34:48.028 --> 00:34:48.658
little bit to that.

00:34:48.658 --> 00:34:51.138
Some of what Genentech is
looking at as well so I

00:34:51.138 --> 00:34:54.978
mentioned trying to keep
people as Mike has

00:34:54.978 --> 00:34:55.778
talked about as well.

00:34:55.778 --> 00:34:59.998
Try to keep people in one
interface, on there's a lot of

00:34:59.998 --> 00:35:03.158
benefit there, so looking at
the contextual gadgets, there's

00:35:03.158 --> 00:35:06.498
a lot of opportunity in that
area specifically to integrate

00:35:06.498 --> 00:35:09.078
with some of the legacy
systems that we have.

00:35:09.078 --> 00:35:15.358
So, for example, you look
at SAP and you get email

00:35:15.358 --> 00:35:18.300
notifications for invoice
approvals or for payment

00:35:18.300 --> 00:35:20.420
processing, whatever it is,
there's a lot of opportunity

00:35:20.420 --> 00:35:24.900
there to keep people from
having to jump over to SAP log

00:35:24.900 --> 00:35:28.578
in, do the transaction and then
come back to the email message.

00:35:28.578 --> 00:35:30.638
You could actually
implement that within the

00:35:30.638 --> 00:35:31.638
contextual gadget too.

00:35:31.638 --> 00:35:32.498
So, this something that we
are thinking about to.

00:35:33.018 --> 00:35:39.978
AUDIENCE: Ok, guys,
thanks for your time.

00:35:39.978 --> 00:35:42.540
Two-part question: How do
you see these approach is

00:35:42.540 --> 00:35:44.280
integrating with other
social and collaberation

00:35:44.280 --> 00:35:45.320
portals like Wave?

00:35:46.860 --> 00:35:48.098
And also, how do you see
them fitting in with

00:35:48.098 --> 00:35:53.098
other enterprise portal
framework like Liferay?

00:35:53.098 --> 00:35:53.358
MATT PRUDEN: I'm sorry.

00:35:53.358 --> 00:35:53.450
I

00:35:53.450 --> 00:35:53.638
missed the second question.

00:35:53.858 --> 00:35:56.118
AUDIENCE: How do you see these
kinds of integration approaches

00:35:56.118 --> 00:35:58.878
working with other enterprise
portal frameworks like Liferay,

00:35:58.878 --> 00:36:03.618
or Oracle Portal, or
Sharepoint, or pick a flavor.

00:36:03.618 --> 00:36:04.698
Is there an integration path?

00:36:04.258 --> 00:36:06.258
Is there any
strategy behind it?

00:36:06.258 --> 00:36:13.318
Has anyone thought in
that direction yet?

00:36:13.498 --> 00:36:14.958
MIKE O'BRIEN: I guess I can
answer the second part

00:36:14.958 --> 00:36:16.338
of question generally.

00:36:16.338 --> 00:36:21.300
I'm not familiar with a lot of
those products, but what we

00:36:21.300 --> 00:36:26.018
have tried to do at Genentech
as well and really everywhere,

00:36:26.018 --> 00:36:32.578
is push the open standard,
so use open ID, use

00:36:32.578 --> 00:36:32.760
three-legged OAuth.

00:36:34.880 --> 00:36:38.440
use these things and then
hopefully all the vendors that

00:36:38.440 --> 00:36:40.486
typically do things in a
proprietary fashion are going

00:36:40.486 --> 00:36:44.358
to gradually trend in more of a
standards way and the

00:36:44.358 --> 00:36:46.938
investments we make in
the standards will

00:36:46.938 --> 00:36:47.458
continue to work.

00:36:47.458 --> 00:36:50.118
AUDIENCE: Could you just
extend that statement?

00:36:50.438 --> 00:36:53.420
Would you consider Portlet
standards like GSR-T68 as

00:36:53.420 --> 00:36:58.478
being part of that family
or not part of that family?

00:36:58.478 --> 00:37:00.578
MIKE O'BRIEN: I'm not familiar
enough with it to answer that,

00:37:00.578 --> 00:37:04.738
but it sounds like
its a standard.

00:37:04.738 --> 00:37:06.558
MATT PRUDEN: I'll try to answer
the first part of that,

00:37:06.558 --> 00:37:08.998
regarding Wave, obviously we've
all been using Wave

00:37:08.998 --> 00:37:10.378
for the last year.

00:37:11.118 --> 00:37:15.098
We've used it in the consultant
environment with a number of

00:37:15.098 --> 00:37:19.120
customers and were aware that
it was coming to Google Apps

00:37:19.120 --> 00:37:20.280
obviously for some time now.

00:37:20.280 --> 00:37:22.360
Thrilled with the
announcement this morning.

00:37:22.360 --> 00:37:25.020
And we're looking forward
using it out the field.

00:37:25.738 --> 00:37:28.098
Project based sort of
collaberative communication

00:37:28.098 --> 00:37:30.318
work is where we've seen
that the best usage of it.

00:37:30.318 --> 00:37:35.458
In terms of expanding upon that
it's still early stage, but

00:37:35.458 --> 00:37:40.338
certainly we'll see
opportunities there.
783
00:37:40,338 --&gt; 00:37:40,138
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:37:40.138 --> 00:37:45.060
AUDIENCE: Genentech, how do you
feel that Google's meeting your

00:37:45.060 --> 00:37:48.098
compliance needs with respect
to HIPAA and GMP for the

00:37:48.098 --> 00:37:50.198
software you have to develop?

00:37:51.538 --> 00:37:54.618
Do they make your compliance
people happy with the security

00:37:54.618 --> 00:37:57.978
they provided and the
software testing and so on?

00:37:57.978 --> 00:37:58.178
ADAM GRAFF: In general yes.

00:37:58.178 --> 00:38:01.538
Within Genentech there's a
pretty distinct line drawn

00:38:01.538 --> 00:38:08.800
between the validated world, so
to speak, GNP, GCP, GLP -- for

00:38:08.800 --> 00:38:11.680
those of you that don't know in
the audience, this is like FDA

00:38:11.680 --> 00:38:15.538
regulations speak for systems
that have to deal with drug

00:38:15.538 --> 00:38:19.178
manufacturing --so there's a
very distinct line that's

00:38:19.178 --> 00:38:21.558
drawn between the two.

00:38:21.958 --> 00:38:25.320
We have gone through a
particular exercise with one of

00:38:25.320 --> 00:38:30.680
our integrations between SAP
and Google and have had pretty

00:38:30.680 --> 00:38:33.458
good success with that
particular instance in getting

00:38:33.458 --> 00:38:38.718
qualities buy off on the
security model the data

00:38:38.718 --> 00:38:42.198
center security as well.

00:38:44.058 --> 00:38:45.318
I think there's some
opportunity there.

00:38:45.318 --> 00:38:48.738
It a little more difficult just
because of the nature of what

00:38:48.738 --> 00:38:51.078
you're dealing with in the
regulated environment.

00:38:51.078 --> 00:38:54.618
But, yeah they seem generally
pretty pleased as long as we

00:38:54.618 --> 00:39:02.718
don't cross the line too much.

00:39:02.718 --> 00:39:04.358
AUDIENCE: Ok, Thanks.

00:39:04.358 --> 00:39:04.658
MATT PRUDEN: Any
other questions?

00:39:04.658 --> 00:39:07.604
AUDIENCE: You were obviously
using something before Google

00:39:07.604 --> 00:39:09.820
Apps, so what was that, and
what were the challenges in

00:39:09.820 --> 00:39:14.078
moving the users from where you
were to over the Google Apps?

00:39:14.338 --> 00:39:17.198
What kinds of things
should we look out for?

00:39:17.198 --> 00:39:17.398
ADAM GRAFF: Sure.

00:39:17.398 --> 00:39:18.738
Good question.

00:39:18.738 --> 00:39:24.678
So before using Google Apps, we
were using Oracle Calendar for

00:39:24.678 --> 00:39:28.240
our calendaring system and the
reason we were using Oracle

00:39:28.240 --> 00:39:31.200
Calendar, like I said before,
is because we needed that broad

00:39:31.200 --> 00:39:35.060
platform support in
supporting both Macs and PCs

00:39:35.060 --> 00:39:35.358
and mobile devices.

00:39:35.718 --> 00:39:39.138
And then for our email
solution, we were, and still

00:39:39.138 --> 00:39:42.698
are, for some people that
haven't migrated yet using

00:39:42.698 --> 00:39:44.638
SendMail as the infrastructure.

00:39:44.518 --> 00:39:50.800
So the migration from Oracle
Calendar to Google Calendar was

00:39:50.800 --> 00:39:56.840
a cut over events so we did it
with Appirio actually over a

00:39:56.840 --> 00:39:58.280
weekend, migrated every data.

00:39:58.578 --> 00:39:59.920
They got to work on Monday
morning and they were

00:39:59.920 --> 00:40:01.718
on Google Calendar.

00:40:01.718 --> 00:40:05.878
That was a largely successful,
extremely successful

00:40:05.878 --> 00:40:08.658
implementation that in many
ways kind of set the standard

00:40:08.658 --> 00:40:12.498
for how Google apps migrations
have gone forward after that.

00:40:12.800 --> 00:40:16.478
Our email migration, just
because of the complexity that

00:40:16.478 --> 00:40:21.038
we have, we don't limit our
users mailboxes sizes at

00:40:21.038 --> 00:40:24.280
Genentech so we have a lot of
people with a lot of

00:40:24.280 --> 00:40:25.000
large mailboxes.

00:40:25.000 --> 00:40:28.340
Some people have been there for
30 years, so on and so forth.

00:40:28.340 --> 00:40:30.738
So that that's a little more
complex because of the amount

00:40:30.738 --> 00:40:33.260
of data that we're dealing
with, so we have to migrate

00:40:33.260 --> 00:40:35.540
them in a different way.

00:40:35.540 --> 00:40:39.118
Its not a cutover event, its a
800 people every other week

00:40:39.118 --> 00:40:47.058
kind of thing and actually
going very well for us so far.

00:40:47.058 --> 00:40:48.558
AUDIENCE: Can

00:40:48.558 --> 00:40:49.440
you comment a little bit
more about your PS Connect?

00:40:49.440 --> 00:40:51.398
Is it something like Gmail?

00:40:51.398 --> 00:40:52.238
And you can see the
advertising?Is it

00:40:52.238 --> 00:40:54.598
related to your mail?

00:40:54.598 --> 00:40:55.638
Something like that?

00:40:55.638 --> 00:41:03.558
I mean how does
PS Connect work?

00:41:03.558 --> 00:41:08.758
MATT PRUDEN: So, PS Connect is
a Gmail contextual gadget that

00:41:08.758 --> 00:41:12.258
uses a force.com application at
the back end integrated behind

00:41:12.258 --> 00:41:16.840
the scenes called PSEnterprise
and it's extracting data out of

00:41:16.840 --> 00:41:20.838
this force.com application and
displaying it in an intelligent

00:41:20.838 --> 00:41:23.618
way based on the sender of
email, the receiver of the

00:41:23.618 --> 00:41:26.000
email, or the content
of the email.

00:41:26.000 --> 00:41:30.366
AUDIENCE: You searched
every word of the content?

00:41:31.458 --> 00:41:32.338
Yes.

00:41:32.338 --> 00:41:35.818
Any other questions?

00:41:35.818 --> 00:41:41.838
AUDIENCE: Now you have
integrating this ESP and Google

00:41:41.838 --> 00:41:47.820
app, and is that a big problem
or how's infrastructure

00:41:47.820 --> 00:41:50.898
behind that?

00:41:50.898 --> 00:41:56.238
MIKE O'BRIEN: It's actually
extreme simple, so the

00:41:56.238 --> 00:42:00.438
infrastructure from Google,
from my perspective it's let's

00:42:00.438 --> 00:42:04.018
say if I was programming an app
engine it's very simple I can

00:42:04.018 --> 00:42:09.178
just send an HTTP request to a
URL and its give me JSON

00:42:09.178 --> 00:42:10.278
or whatever I want.

00:42:10.278 --> 00:42:14.958
Give me XML and then I
just consume that like I

00:42:14.958 --> 00:42:16.378
would any data source.

00:42:16.378 --> 00:42:21.918
So, from that perspective
it's very simple.

00:42:22.038 --> 00:42:24.858
Its obviously a little bit more
complex behind the scenes.

00:42:24.858 --> 00:42:27.760
A lot of that calendar I would
suspect, although i didn't

00:42:27.760 --> 00:42:31.360
write this code but a lot of
the calendar API interaction

00:42:31.360 --> 00:42:35.598
that's happening in the ESP is
it's probably extracting a lot

00:42:35.598 --> 00:42:37.578
of Gdata, calendar
calls, right?

00:42:38.078 --> 00:42:40.510
Getting event feeds searching
and those feeds and doing those

00:42:40.510 --> 00:42:44.618
kinds of things and that's
done in java in the

00:42:44.618 --> 00:42:51.018
enterprise service bus.

00:42:51.018 --> 00:42:51.558
AUDIENCE: OK, Thanks.

00:42:51.558 --> 00:42:53.758
AUDIENCE: Hi, hey, thanks
again for the presentation.

00:42:53.758 --> 00:42:54.378
I really appreciate that.

00:42:55.278 --> 00:42:58.998
I notice in most the client
examples that you gave were all

00:42:58.998 --> 00:43:02.978
through the web interface using
the Gmail interface and I was

00:43:02.978 --> 00:43:07.720
curious if you allow users to
use, say, a desktop client

00:43:07.720 --> 00:43:08.620
of their preference?

00:43:08.620 --> 00:43:11.178
Say maybe have users who
like Microsoft Outlook

00:43:11.178 --> 00:43:12.280
or Apple mail?

00:43:12.280 --> 00:43:16.998
And if you do, I'm curious to
see if that if that works?

00:43:16.998 --> 00:43:17.638
How well thats work for you?

00:43:19.018 --> 00:43:19.478
ADAM GRAFF: Sure,
good question.

00:43:20.058 --> 00:43:25.238
So the strategy that we are
employing for our deployment

00:43:25.238 --> 00:43:28.598
is to move people to the
web interface first.

00:43:28.598 --> 00:43:32.118
We have done some pretty
in-depth analysis on of what

00:43:32.118 --> 00:43:35.078
are the issues that people
run into with email?

00:43:37.578 --> 00:43:39.798
Is the problems with the
clients, the thick client?

00:43:39.798 --> 00:43:41.318
Is the problems with the
back end mail serve?

00:43:41.318 --> 00:43:43.340
And so on and so forth.

00:43:43.340 --> 00:43:48.680
So, what we found is that based
on a pilot we ran for about a

00:43:48.680 --> 00:43:52.020
year, we find that people end
up after they get over the

00:43:52.020 --> 00:43:54.940
initial hump of adjusting to
the web interface and go

00:43:54.940 --> 00:43:58.658
through the change, get the
right training, get the right

00:43:58.658 --> 00:44:01.200
support, they end up having
fewer problems than the web

00:44:01.200 --> 00:44:04.238
interface than what they had in
the Outlook or Apple Mail

00:44:04.238 --> 00:44:07.978
interface, so we do allow
people to make the choice

00:44:07.978 --> 00:44:08.318
for the most part.

00:44:09.938 --> 00:44:12.378
We go first to the Web UI, than
if you just you can't live in

00:44:12.378 --> 00:44:15.198
it, or have a business reason
for needing the Apple Mail, or

00:44:15.198 --> 00:44:16.820
Outlook client, we'll
give it to you.

00:44:16.820 --> 00:44:19.338
We're not going to restrict you
but, we do encourage people

00:44:19.338 --> 00:44:20.798
to go that way first.

00:44:20.798 --> 00:44:23.838
And we trained to that, and
provide a change management

00:44:23.838 --> 00:44:27.038
support for that as well.

00:44:27.038 --> 00:44:30.178
AUDIENCE: Hi, you mentioned
real estate as being a concern

00:44:30.178 --> 00:44:33.158
in the gmail interface.

00:44:33.158 --> 00:44:36.598
Do you have any provision in
place for changes that Google

00:44:36.598 --> 00:44:41.098
might make to the interface,
and is there anyway ahead of

00:44:41.098 --> 00:44:46.418
time where your box might
get eliminated by new box?

00:44:46.418 --> 00:44:47.178
MIKE O'BRIEN: That's a
really good question.

00:44:47.178 --> 00:44:55.218
So one of the benefits of
using Google Apps, it's

00:44:55.218 --> 00:44:56.058
always changing, right?

00:44:56.058 --> 00:45:00.658
It seems like features come out
every day and certainly Google

00:45:00.658 --> 00:45:04.400
could release a feature that
could impact a particular user

00:45:04.400 --> 00:45:07.498
interface that we're going for.

00:45:07.498 --> 00:45:11.738
But the good thing is that
these things happen slowly so

00:45:11.738 --> 00:45:15.798
usually it's not as if the
entire sidebar is going

00:45:15.798 --> 00:45:16.320
to go away one day.

00:45:16.320 --> 00:45:19.760
They go away if they were to
do that, in my experience,

00:45:19.760 --> 00:45:22.798
they would communicate
a change of that size.

00:45:23.258 --> 00:45:25.658
And, I'm interested in your
perspective on this, Adam.

00:45:25.658 --> 00:45:30.078
I think enterprises are
probably a bit scared of

00:45:30.078 --> 00:45:34.818
that kind of rapid pace of
innovation when they start.

00:45:34.818 --> 00:45:37.478
But, I really think users or
are familiar with it, because

00:45:37.478 --> 00:45:38.678
so many people use
Gmail every day.

00:45:39.598 --> 00:45:42.078
This kind of thing doesn't
really bother people I think.

00:45:43.158 --> 00:45:46.940
And, I think that as users
begin using Google Apps, in the

00:45:46.940 --> 00:45:49.958
enterprise, these small changes
they'll see as good

00:45:49.958 --> 00:45:50.818
things, right?

00:45:50.818 --> 00:45:54.578
Not, as oh my gosh you're
breaking something.

00:45:54.578 --> 00:45:56.118
Is that kind of what you seen?

00:45:56.118 --> 00:45:57.158
ADAM GRAFF: Yeah, absolutely.

00:45:57.158 --> 00:46:01.378
In the beginning when we first
moved from Oracle Calendar to

00:46:01.378 --> 00:46:04.798
Google Calendar, there was a
shock period for people

00:46:04.798 --> 00:46:07.598
especially whenever new changes
would come up, we'd get tons of

00:46:07.598 --> 00:46:10.158
calls to our service desk
asking what is this?

00:46:10.518 --> 00:46:12.858
How do I use it, in and
so on and so forth.

00:46:12.978 --> 00:46:14.198
And, what we've seen over time
is that people gradually adjust

00:46:14.198 --> 00:46:18.358
they go back to that to that
mentality, oh yea is just

00:46:18.358 --> 00:46:21.240
gmail, its just Google calendar
and this is kind of the

00:46:21.240 --> 00:46:26.138
way things work with it.

00:46:26.138 --> 00:46:30.698
AUDIENCE: This is for
Genentech question.

00:46:30.698 --> 00:46:33.578
You mentioned primary data
associated with corporate

00:46:33.578 --> 00:46:35.298
information like user
accounts and so forth.

00:46:36.798 --> 00:46:37.258
[? Inpharma ?]

00:46:37.258 --> 00:46:40.598
is a big componant
of scientific data.

00:46:40.760 --> 00:46:43.678
Do you perceive issues related
to migrating some of the

00:46:43.678 --> 00:46:47.300
scientific information
particularly computation aspect

00:46:47.300 --> 00:46:48.858
running on the app engine?

00:46:48.858 --> 00:46:51.098
Have you seen any requests
from that space?

00:46:52.478 --> 00:46:55.738
ADAM GRAFF: So no,
not necessarily.

00:46:55.738 --> 00:46:58.438
We don't really see a
security risk in having

00:46:58.438 --> 00:46:59.998
that data hosted.

00:46:59.998 --> 00:47:01.820
Is that the question
you're asking?

00:47:01.820 --> 00:47:02.078
AUDIENCE: That's one aspect.

00:47:02.078 --> 00:47:05.780
Also, its a regulated
environment, as you know.

00:47:11.340 --> 00:47:14.218
ADAM GRAFF: We don't really see
a risk in migrating data out.

00:47:14.718 --> 00:47:18.580
Scientific research data,
things of that sort, the

00:47:18.580 --> 00:47:22.798
security that google apps is
able to provide for the most

00:47:22.798 --> 00:47:25.660
part at least meets, and in
many places exceeds the

00:47:25.660 --> 00:47:27.360
security that we're able
to provide in terms of

00:47:27.360 --> 00:47:29.958
how it's implemented.

00:47:29.958 --> 00:47:31.998
AUDIENCE: I was more like
concerned about the

00:47:31.998 --> 00:47:32.878
lawyers aspect.

00:47:32.878 --> 00:47:37.738
ADAM GRAFF: Oh, the
lawyers aspect, yes.

00:47:37.738 --> 00:47:40.800
It did take some work to get to
the point where our lawyers

00:47:40.800 --> 00:47:42.380
were comfortable with us
storing information

00:47:42.380 --> 00:47:43.038
in the cloud.

00:47:46.898 --> 00:47:50.398
I think I showed the slide of
the timeline where we spent

00:47:50.398 --> 00:47:52.780
time evaluating what
the platform was.

00:47:52.780 --> 00:47:57.058
I'd say about 90% of that
time was time with lawyers

00:47:57.058 --> 00:47:57.300
getting them familiar.

00:47:57.300 --> 00:48:01.158
Having them converse with the
Google's lawyers to understand

00:48:01.158 --> 00:48:06.358
exactly what the use cases or
what the possibilities are and

00:48:06.358 --> 00:48:09.720
then for the most part there's
only one particular area where

00:48:09.720 --> 00:48:12.800
we found a gap, and it has to
do with data privacy protection

00:48:12.800 --> 00:48:15.678
laws when you get into a very
specific kind of lawsuit

00:48:15.678 --> 00:48:17.118
and that's basically it.

00:48:17.118 --> 00:48:20.198
That's what it boils down to
but you know it does take some

00:48:20.198 --> 00:48:22.440
time if you're looking at it
with your corporate lawyers.

00:48:22.440 --> 00:48:29.558
It takes time to get them
comfortable with it.

00:48:29.558 --> 00:48:32.920
AUDIENCE: Continuing the lawyer
discussion, can you touch on

00:48:32.920 --> 00:48:36.960
how you're dealing with
discovery for legal holds and

00:48:36.960 --> 00:48:39.960
also coming from the education
space where we deal with HIPAA

00:48:39.960 --> 00:48:43.878
and FERPA a lot and is it
possible or have you already

00:48:43.878 --> 00:48:47.278
published a generic thing like
Genentech thinks this is cool

00:48:47.278 --> 00:48:50.558
and we're OK with it and
therefore you should feel

00:48:50.558 --> 00:48:54.798
less on scared of it?

00:48:54.798 --> 00:48:56.478
ADAM GRAFF: I'm not sure
I understood the last

00:48:56.478 --> 00:48:57.238
part of your question.

00:48:57.238 --> 00:48:59.018
AUDIENCE: Is there just a
general announcement that

00:48:59.018 --> 00:49:03.878
Genentech has done this, and
we're fine with that the

00:49:03.878 --> 00:49:06.118
implications of going this way?

00:49:06.118 --> 00:49:09.638
ADAM GRAFF: Ok, so in terms of
ediscovery and legal holds, we

00:49:09.638 --> 00:49:12.158
have implemented a custom
solution for that.

00:49:12.158 --> 00:49:18.898
It integrates with our on
premise ediscovery systems, so

00:49:18.898 --> 00:49:23.198
because of the API access that
we have through the supervision

00:49:23.198 --> 00:49:28.680
API we're able to get people's
mailboxes and then we also have

00:49:28.680 --> 00:49:32.400
implemented retention policy
with Gmail so that email is

00:49:32.400 --> 00:49:34.178
cleaned at a certain
time period.

00:49:34.178 --> 00:49:38.638
There certain labels that you
can apply that will circumvent

00:49:38.638 --> 00:49:42.338
the janitoring and there's a
legal hold label and there's a

00:49:42.338 --> 00:49:45.474
save type of label that we
use at Genentech as well.

00:49:45.474 --> 00:49:46.472
AUDIENCE:
1011
00:49:46,472 --&gt; 00:49:46,468
[INAUDIBLE]

00:49:46.468 --> 00:49:49.450
ADAM GRAFF: No we're not.

00:49:50.444 --> 00:49:51.438
Go ahead.

00:49:53.430 --> 00:49:54.424
What's that?
1015
00:49:56,898 --&gt; 00:49:56,338
Oh, why not Postini?

00:49:56.338 --> 00:50:00.158
That's a simple question,
a very complex answer.

00:50:01.978 --> 00:50:07.918
We have, at Genentech, we have
a pretty substantial MTA

00:50:07.918 --> 00:50:11.618
infrastructure that we use to
handle our mail routing, and

00:50:11.618 --> 00:50:14.360
there's a lot of history behind
why we do things a certain way

00:50:14.360 --> 00:50:20.298
to keep email within the bounds
of Genentech so to speak.

00:50:20.358 --> 00:50:21.638
A lot of it has
to do with that.

00:50:21.638 --> 00:50:24.738
The MTA infrastructure
that we've implemented is

00:50:24.738 --> 00:50:25.998
kind of a legacy system.

00:50:26.320 --> 00:50:30.800
It's got a lot of very complex
routing rules and things that

00:50:30.800 --> 00:50:32.678
are there that we weren't
able to port over to

00:50:32.678 --> 00:50:39.178
Postini just yet.

00:50:39.178 --> 00:50:41.178
AUDIENCE: I wanted to ask all
bit more about the HIPAA piece,

00:50:41.178 --> 00:50:43.598
because I'm not sure how much
you're effected by that

00:50:43.598 --> 00:50:44.598
or not in your company.

00:50:44.598 --> 00:50:48.258
So handling patient data, it
seems to me the biggest issue

00:50:48.258 --> 00:50:51.678
is the business associate
agreement that has to happen as

00:50:51.678 --> 00:50:55.978
part of the chain from patients
to people managing the middle.

00:50:55.978 --> 00:50:59.118
Did you handle that, and how
was your relationship to

00:50:59.118 --> 00:51:02.280
Google, in terms of you signing
one and then the next person

00:51:02.280 --> 00:51:04.838
of chain of custody,
if you don't mind.

00:51:04.838 --> 00:51:07.438
ADAM GRAFF: Sure, so all of our
confidential patient and HIPAA

00:51:07.438 --> 00:51:11.658
information is stored in other
systems so it's policy, in

00:51:11.658 --> 00:51:14.178
general, within Genentech that
we don't communicate this type

00:51:14.178 --> 00:51:16.320
of information across
email to begin with.

00:51:16.320 --> 00:51:18.138
It's all held within
certain systems.

00:51:18.138 --> 00:51:22.820
Communication is handled from
there, so I don't know if that

00:51:22.820 --> 00:51:25.898
answers your question regarding
HIPAA compliance, but that's

00:51:25.898 --> 00:51:32.298
how we do its at Genentech.

00:51:32.298 --> 00:51:35.860
MIKE O'BRIEN: Any
other questions?

00:51:35.860 --> 00:51:36.938
Ok, then I think we're
going to wrap up just

00:51:36.938 --> 00:51:38.598
a few minutes early.

00:51:38.598 --> 00:51:41.378
Hopefully that was both
interesting and educational.

00:51:41.378 --> 00:51:44.398
Maybe it gave you some ideas of
things that you can do within

00:51:44.398 --> 00:51:47.578
your company or things you
can do with your customers.

00:51:47.578 --> 00:51:51.798
We also invite you to come
visit in the Enterprise

00:51:51.798 --> 00:51:53.038
pavilion at Appirio booth.

00:51:53.038 --> 00:51:58.038
Thank you very much.
