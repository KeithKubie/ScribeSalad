organize better and how can we possibly

later I think that if we want to think

later I think that if we want to think
 

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:36.600
later I think that if we want to think
about theory and thinking about how we

so dignity is a complex concept it

00:10:28.400 --> 00:10:28.410
so dignity is a complex concept it
 

00:10:28.410 --> 00:10:32.810
so dignity is a complex concept it
increases complexity of a theory but I

00:10:32.810 --> 00:10:32.820
increases complexity of a theory but I
 

00:10:32.820 --> 00:10:35.360
increases complexity of a theory but I
think it increases accuracy as well so

00:10:35.360 --> 00:10:35.370

we call that economists there are ways

then there are a lot of conversations

00:11:10.970 --> 00:11:10.980
then there are a lot of conversations
 

00:11:10.980 --> 00:11:13.280
then there are a lot of conversations
about how we can promote dignity to

00:11:13.280 --> 00:11:13.290
about how we can promote dignity to
 

00:11:13.290 --> 00:11:15.950
about how we can promote dignity to
increase wealth and I think that is the

00:11:15.950 --> 00:11:15.960
increase wealth and I think that is the
 

00:11:15.960 --> 00:11:18.940
increase wealth and I think that is the
typical CSR conversation in many ways

how do we engage in socially responsive

how do we engage in socially responsive

I think that's fatal in many ways if we

I think that's fatal in many ways if we
 

00:11:31.230 --> 00:11:33.290
I think that's fatal in many ways if we
stick to that kind of understanding and

00:11:33.290 --> 00:11:33.300
stick to that kind of understanding and
 

00:11:33.300 --> 00:11:35.060
stick to that kind of understanding and
that's why I think we need to really

00:11:35.060 --> 00:11:35.070
that's why I think we need to really
 

00:11:35.070 --> 00:11:36.650
that's why I think we need to really
rethink the objective function and the

00:11:58.280 --> 00:11:58.290
humanistic perspective the well-being
 

00:11:58.290 --> 00:12:00.410
humanistic perspective the well-being
creation could be an alternative view so

00:12:00.410 --> 00:12:00.420
creation could be an alternative view so
 

00:12:00.420 --> 00:12:02.840
creation could be an alternative view so
the objective function shifts then we

00:12:02.840 --> 00:12:02.850
the objective function shifts then we
 

00:12:02.850 --> 00:12:04.370
the objective function shifts then we
have different models and the one that

00:12:04.370 --> 00:12:04.380
have different models and the one that
 

00:12:04.380 --> 00:12:07.160
have different models and the one that
is I think that Nina was referring to

00:12:07.160 --> 00:12:07.170
is I think that Nina was referring to
 

00:12:07.170 --> 00:12:10.520
is I think that Nina was referring to
that provides for this dangerous kind of

00:12:10.520 --> 00:12:10.530
that provides for this dangerous kind of
 

00:12:10.530 --> 00:12:12.530
that provides for this dangerous kind of
organizing where well possibly we are

00:12:12.530 --> 00:12:12.540
organizing where well possibly we are
 

00:12:12.540 --> 00:12:13.880
organizing where well possibly we are
going for the common good

00:12:13.880 --> 00:12:13.890
going for the common good
 

00:12:13.890 --> 00:12:16.310
going for the common good
but we're neglecting dignity which

00:12:16.310 --> 00:12:16.320
but we're neglecting dignity which
 

00:12:16.320 --> 00:12:19.070
but we're neglecting dignity which
includes all totalitarianism which

00:12:19.070 --> 00:12:19.080
includes all totalitarianism which
 

00:12:19.080 --> 00:12:21.380
includes all totalitarianism which
includes paternalistic structures which

00:12:21.380 --> 00:12:21.390
includes paternalistic structures which
 

00:12:21.390 --> 00:12:23.480
includes paternalistic structures which
is dangerous and we need to be very

00:12:23.480 --> 00:12:23.490
is dangerous and we need to be very
 

00:12:23.490 --> 00:12:26.440
is dangerous and we need to be very
clear that this is a trap that could be

00:12:26.440 --> 00:12:26.450
clear that this is a trap that could be
 

00:12:26.450 --> 00:12:30.290
clear that this is a trap that could be
coming under the humanistic label and I

00:12:30.290 --> 00:12:30.300
coming under the humanistic label and I
 

00:12:30.300 --> 00:12:31.430
coming under the humanistic label and I
think we need to be very clear that this

00:12:31.430 --> 00:12:31.440
think we need to be very clear that this
 

00:12:31.440 --> 00:12:33.560
think we need to be very clear that this
dignity is the distinction the

00:12:33.560 --> 00:12:33.570
dignity is the distinction the
 

00:12:33.570 --> 00:12:35.410
dignity is the distinction the
protection of dignity doesn't allow for

00:12:35.410 --> 00:12:35.420
protection of dignity doesn't allow for
 

00:12:35.420 --> 00:12:38.410
protection of dignity doesn't allow for
totalitarianism or even paternalism and

00:12:38.410 --> 00:12:38.420
totalitarianism or even paternalism and
 

00:12:38.420 --> 00:12:40.970
totalitarianism or even paternalism and
we call it bounded humanism and then the

00:12:40.970 --> 00:12:40.980
we call it bounded humanism and then the
 

00:12:40.980 --> 00:12:43.070
we call it bounded humanism and then the
ultimate form we would say is promoting

00:12:43.070 --> 00:12:43.080
ultimate form we would say is promoting
 

00:12:43.080 --> 00:12:45.320
ultimate form we would say is promoting
dignity and well-being creation which is

00:12:45.320 --> 00:12:45.330
dignity and well-being creation which is
 

00:12:45.330 --> 00:12:47.390
dignity and well-being creation which is
a humanistic form and we think that you

00:12:47.390 --> 00:12:47.400
a humanistic form and we think that you
 

00:12:47.400 --> 00:12:49.160
a humanistic form and we think that you
can do that if you can do research

00:12:49.160 --> 00:12:49.170
can do that if you can do research
 

00:12:49.170 --> 00:12:50.810
can do that if you can do research
around these things if you can

00:12:50.810 --> 00:12:50.820
around these things if you can
 

00:12:50.820 --> 00:12:53.660
around these things if you can
reformulate your theory you can teach

00:12:53.660 --> 00:12:53.670
reformulate your theory you can teach
 

00:12:53.670 --> 00:12:55.670
reformulate your theory you can teach
differently you can practice differently

00:12:55.670 --> 00:12:55.680
differently you can practice differently
 

00:12:55.680 --> 00:12:57.110
differently you can practice differently
and it's already done in many different

00:12:57.110 --> 00:12:57.120
and it's already done in many different
 

00:12:57.120 --> 00:12:59.420
and it's already done in many different
ways and you can formulate policy and

00:12:59.420 --> 00:12:59.430
ways and you can formulate policy and
 

00:12:59.430 --> 00:13:01.310
ways and you can formulate policy and
that's already happening but I think we

00:13:01.310 --> 00:13:01.320
that's already happening but I think we
 

00:13:01.320 --> 00:13:02.840
that's already happening but I think we
need to go back if we have the question

00:13:02.840 --> 00:13:02.850
need to go back if we have the question
 

00:13:02.850 --> 00:13:04.730
need to go back if we have the question
that how can we develop trust and

00:13:04.730 --> 00:13:04.740
that how can we develop trust and
 

00:13:04.740 --> 00:13:06.470
that how can we develop trust and
ethically healthy organizations I think

00:13:06.470 --> 00:13:06.480
ethically healthy organizations I think
 

00:13:06.480 --> 00:13:08.240
ethically healthy organizations I think
we need to increase our level of

00:13:08.240 --> 00:13:08.250
we need to increase our level of
 

00:13:08.250 --> 00:13:11.210
we need to increase our level of
mindfulness and shift also mindsets

00:13:11.210 --> 00:13:11.220
mindfulness and shift also mindsets
 

00:13:11.220 --> 00:13:13.130
mindfulness and shift also mindsets
about it so that's I think where I leave

00:13:13.130 --> 00:13:13.140
about it so that's I think where I leave
 

00:13:13.140 --> 00:13:27.740
about it so that's I think where I leave
it for now

00:13:27.740 --> 00:13:27.750
 
 

00:13:27.750 --> 00:13:29.810
