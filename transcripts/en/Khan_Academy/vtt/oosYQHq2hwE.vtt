00:00:00.910 --> 00:00:04.760
Welcome to my presentation on
mortgage-backed securities.

00:00:04.760 --> 00:00:05.730
Let's get started.

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:07.560
And this is going to be part
of a whole new series of

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:10.840
presentations, because I think
what's happening right now in

00:00:10.840 --> 00:00:14.670
the credit markets is pretty
significant from, I guess, a

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:16.510
personal finance point of
view and just from a

00:00:16.510 --> 00:00:17.730
historic point of view.

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:20.130
And I want to do a whole set
of videos just so people

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:23.870
understand, I guess, how
everything fits together, and

00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:25.470
what the possible repercussions
could be.

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:26.690
But we have to start
with the basics.

00:00:26.690 --> 00:00:28.170
So what is a mortgage-backed
security?

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:29.940
You've probably read
a lot about these.

00:00:29.940 --> 00:00:33.440
So historically, let's think
about what historically

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:37.100
happens when I went to get a
loan for a house, let's say,

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:37.850
20 years ago.

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:38.920
And I'm going to simplify
some things.

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:40.250
And later we can do
a more nuanced.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.000
Where'd my pen go?

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.150
Let's say I need $100,000.

00:00:48.150 --> 00:00:50.210
No, let me say $1 million,
because that's actually closer

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:52.710
to how much houses cost now.

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:57.080
Let's say I need a $1 million
loan to buy a house, right?

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:58.990
This is going to be a mortgage
that's going to be

00:00:58.990 --> 00:01:00.160
backed by my house.

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:03.150
And when I say backed by my
house, or secured by my house,

00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:08.230
that means that I'm going to
borrow $1 million from a bank,

00:01:08.230 --> 00:01:10.780
and if I can't pay back
the loan, then the

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:11.590
bank gets my house.

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:13.210
That's all it means.

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:15.800
And oftentimes it'll only be
secured by the house, which

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:17.310
means that I could just give
them back the keys.

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:19.760
They get the house and I have
no other responsibility, but

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:21.250
of course my credit
gets messed up.

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:22.690
But I need a $1 million loan.

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:28.280
The traditional way I got a $1
million loan is I would go and

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:30.550
talk to the bank.

00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:33.260
This is the bank.

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:34.720
They have the money.

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:41.830
And then they would give me $1
million and I would pay them

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:46.340
some type of interest. I'll
make up a number.

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:48.410
The interest rates obviously
change, and we'll do future

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:50.730
presentations on what causes the
interest rates to change.

00:01:50.730 --> 00:01:55.890
But let's say I would pay them
10% interest. And for the sake

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:59.660
of simplicity, I'm going to
assume that the loans in this

00:01:59.660 --> 00:02:01.690
presentation are interest-only
loans.

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:04.800
In a traditional mortgage, you
actually, your payment has

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:06.950
some part interest and
some part principal.

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:10.419
Principal is actually when
you're paying down the loan.

00:02:10.419 --> 00:02:12.530
The math is a little bit more
difficult with that, so what

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:15.030
we're going to do in this case
is assume that I only pay the

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:17.770
interest portion, and at the
end of the loan I pay the

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:18.800
whole loan amount.

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:23.470
So let's say that this
is a 10-year loan.

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:27.530
So for each year of the 10
years, I'm going to pay

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:33.290
$100,000 in interest. $100,000
per year, right?

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:38.540
And then in year 10, I'm going
to pay the $100,000 and I'm

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:41.490
also going to pay back
the $1 million.

00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:44.150
Right?

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:50.550
Year 1, 2, 3, dot, dot,
dot, dot, 9, 10.

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:52.310
So in year one, I
pay $100,000.

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:53.720
Year two, I pay $100,000.

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:55.030
Year three, I pay $100,000.

00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:56.030
Dot, dot, dot, dot.

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:57.650
Year nine, I pay $100,000.

00:02:57.650 --> 00:03:00.340
And then year 10, I pay the
$100,000 plus I pay back the

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:01.030
$1 million.

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:04.300
So I pay back $1.1 million.

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:08.180
So that's kind of how the cash
is going to be transferred

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:09.830
between me and the bank.

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:11.725
And this is how a-- I don't
want to say a traditional

00:03:11.725 --> 00:03:13.240
loan, because this isn't
a traditional loan, an

00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:17.630
interest-only loan-- but for the
sake of this presentation,

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:19.410
how it's different than a
mortgage-backed security, the

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:21.990
important thing to realize
is that the bank would

00:03:21.990 --> 00:03:23.710
have kept the loan.

00:03:23.710 --> 00:03:25.780
These payments I would have been
making would have been

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:27.010
directly to the bank.

00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:28.540
And that's what the
business that,

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:30.800
historically, banks were in.

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:38.770
Another person, you-- and you
have a hat-- let's say you're

00:03:38.770 --> 00:03:40.610
extremely wealthy and
you would put $1

00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:42.090
million into the bank.

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:42.340
Right?

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:44.320
That's just your life savings
or you inherited

00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:45.260
it from your uncle.

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:47.710
And the bank would pay you,
I don't know, 5%.

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:55.120
And then take that $1 million,
give it to me, and get 10% on

00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:56.680
what I just borrowed.

00:03:56.680 --> 00:03:58.330
And then the bank makes
the difference, right?

00:03:58.330 --> 00:04:01.360
It's paying you 5% percent and
then it's getting 10% from me.

00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:03.790
And we can go later into how
they can pull this off, like

00:04:03.790 --> 00:04:05.270
what happens when you have
to withdraw the money,

00:04:05.270 --> 00:04:05.960
et cetera, et cetera.

00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:09.220
But the important thing to
realize is that these payments

00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:11.210
I make are to the bank.

00:04:11.210 --> 00:04:15.220
That's how loans worked before
the mortgage-backed security

00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:17.320
industry really got developed.

00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:20.550
Now let's do the example with
a mortgage-backed security.

00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:24.460
Now there's still me.

00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:29.040
I still exist. And I still
need $1 million.

00:04:31.950 --> 00:04:34.100
Let's say I still
go to the bank.

00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:35.460
Let's say I go to the bank.

00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:36.710
The bank is still there.

00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:45.550
And like before, the bank
gives me $1 million.

00:04:48.380 --> 00:04:52.320
And then I give the
bank 10% per year.

00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:52.840
Right?

00:04:52.840 --> 00:04:54.940
So it looks very similar
to our old model.

00:04:54.940 --> 00:04:57.900
But in the old model,
the bank would keep

00:04:57.900 --> 00:04:59.040
these payments itself.

00:04:59.040 --> 00:05:03.650
And that $1 million it had is
now used to pay for my house.

00:05:03.650 --> 00:05:05.810
Then there was an innovation.

00:05:05.810 --> 00:05:08.370
Instead of having to get more
deposits in order to keep

00:05:08.370 --> 00:05:10.750
giving out loans, the bank said,
well, why don't I sell

00:05:10.750 --> 00:05:14.030
these loans to a third
party and let them do

00:05:14.030 --> 00:05:15.140
something with it?

00:05:15.140 --> 00:05:16.550
And I know that that might
be a little confusing.

00:05:16.550 --> 00:05:17.640
How do you sell a loan?

00:05:17.640 --> 00:05:18.890
Well let's say there's me.

00:05:18.890 --> 00:05:21.510
And let's say there's
a thousand of me.

00:05:21.510 --> 00:05:22.020
Right?

00:05:22.020 --> 00:05:24.310
There's a bunch of Sals
in the world.

00:05:24.310 --> 00:05:24.820
Right?

00:05:24.820 --> 00:05:28.080
And we each are borrowing
money from the bank.

00:05:28.080 --> 00:05:30.740
So there's a thousand of me.

00:05:30.740 --> 00:05:31.050
Right?

00:05:31.050 --> 00:05:32.460
I'm just saying any kind
of large number.

00:05:32.460 --> 00:05:34.040
It doesn't have to
be a thousand.

00:05:34.040 --> 00:05:36.220
And collectively we
have borrowed a

00:05:36.220 --> 00:05:37.430
thousand times a million.

00:05:37.430 --> 00:05:42.190
So we've collectively borrowed
$1 billion from the bank.

00:05:42.190 --> 00:05:44.570
And we are collectively paying
10% on that, right?

00:05:44.570 --> 00:05:47.330
Because each of us are going to
pay 10% per year, so we're

00:05:47.330 --> 00:05:49.470
each going to pay 10%
on that $1 billion.

00:05:49.470 --> 00:05:49.750
Right?

00:05:49.750 --> 00:05:52.930
So 10% on that $1 billion is
$100 million in interest. So

00:05:52.930 --> 00:05:58.220
this 10% equals $100 million.

00:05:58.220 --> 00:06:02.810
Now the bank says, OK, all the
$1 billion that I had in my

00:06:02.810 --> 00:06:05.830
vaults, or whatever-- I guess
now there's no physical money,

00:06:05.830 --> 00:06:09.500
but in my databases-- is now
out in people's pockets.

00:06:09.500 --> 00:06:10.800
I want to get more money.

00:06:10.800 --> 00:06:13.470
So what the bank does is it
takes all these loans

00:06:13.470 --> 00:06:17.200
together, that $1 billion in
loans, and it says, hey,

00:06:17.200 --> 00:06:22.060
investment bank-- so that's
another bank-- why don't you

00:06:22.060 --> 00:06:23.750
give me $1 billion?

00:06:26.490 --> 00:06:28.850
So the investment bank gives
them $1 billion.

00:06:28.850 --> 00:06:33.110
And then instead of me and the
other thousands of me paying

00:06:33.110 --> 00:06:38.430
the money to this bank, we're
now paying it to this new

00:06:38.430 --> 00:06:40.990
party, right?

00:06:40.990 --> 00:06:43.020
I'm making my picture
very confusing.

00:06:43.020 --> 00:06:44.480
So what just happened?

00:06:44.480 --> 00:06:48.420
When this bank sold the loans--
grouped all of the

00:06:48.420 --> 00:06:50.460
loans together and it folded it
into a big, kind of did it

00:06:50.460 --> 00:06:52.750
on a wholesale basis--
it's sold a thousand

00:06:52.750 --> 00:06:54.090
loans to this bank.

00:06:54.090 --> 00:06:58.330
So this bank paid $1 billion
for the right to get the

00:06:58.330 --> 00:07:00.870
interest and principal payment
on those loans.

00:07:00.870 --> 00:07:06.280
So all that happened is, this
guy got the cash and then this

00:07:06.280 --> 00:07:08.850
bank will now get the
set of payments.

00:07:08.850 --> 00:07:10.930
So you might wonder, why
did this bank do it?

00:07:10.930 --> 00:07:14.210
Well I kind of glazed over the
details, but he probably got a

00:07:14.210 --> 00:07:16.550
lot of fees for doing this, or
maybe he just likes giving

00:07:16.550 --> 00:07:18.130
loans to his customers,
whatever.

00:07:18.130 --> 00:07:20.610
But the actual right answer
is that he got

00:07:20.610 --> 00:07:22.300
fees for doing this.

00:07:22.300 --> 00:07:24.110
And he's actually probably going
to transfer a little bit

00:07:24.110 --> 00:07:26.130
less value to this guy.

00:07:26.130 --> 00:07:28.630
Now, hopefully you understand
the notion of actually

00:07:28.630 --> 00:07:29.610
transferring the loan.

00:07:29.610 --> 00:07:31.980
This guy pays money and now the
payments are essentially

00:07:31.980 --> 00:07:33.840
going to be funnelled to him.

00:07:33.840 --> 00:07:35.810
I only have two minutes left
in this presentation, so in

00:07:35.810 --> 00:07:39.530
the next presentation I'm going
to focus on what this

00:07:39.530 --> 00:07:43.300
guy can now do with the
loan to turn it into a

00:07:43.300 --> 00:07:44.630
mortgage-backed security.

00:07:44.630 --> 00:07:46.250
And this guy's an investment
bank instead of

00:07:46.250 --> 00:07:48.070
a commercial bank.

00:07:48.070 --> 00:07:49.820
That detail is not that
important in understanding

00:07:49.820 --> 00:07:52.020
what a mortgage-backed security
is, but that will

00:07:52.020 --> 00:07:54.820
have to wait until the
next presentation.

00:07:54.820 --> 00:07:56.340
See you soon.
