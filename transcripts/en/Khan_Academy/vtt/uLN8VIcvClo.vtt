00:00:00.114 --> 00:00:01.545
- [Instructor] We're
going to do in this video

00:00:01.545 --> 00:00:03.955
is have an overview of one
of the greatest empires

00:00:03.955 --> 00:00:06.647
and really civilizations of
not only the ancient world,

00:00:06.647 --> 00:00:09.730
but of the world, and that is Persia.

00:00:10.573 --> 00:00:13.876
And we see a map here, this
is the extent of the Persian

00:00:13.876 --> 00:00:17.553
empire at around 500 B.C.E.
under Darius the Great

00:00:17.553 --> 00:00:20.866
and in future videos we'll
talk more about Cyrus the Great

00:00:20.866 --> 00:00:23.888
and Darius the Great and
the various Shah and Shahs

00:00:23.888 --> 00:00:26.718
King of Kings of the Persian
empire, but you can see

00:00:26.718 --> 00:00:28.640
it was a massive empire.

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:32.123
Not only did it contain
modern Iran which is really

00:00:32.123 --> 00:00:35.758
the heart of the Persian
empire, but much of the modern

00:00:35.758 --> 00:00:38.876
Middle East including
Turkey, you have Egypt here

00:00:38.876 --> 00:00:41.318
we go into central Asia
and also Afghanistan

00:00:41.318 --> 00:00:43.758
and even parts of Pakistan.

00:00:43.758 --> 00:00:47.029
But before talking more
about how it was established

00:00:47.029 --> 00:00:50.357
and who established it, I'm
gonna dig down a little bit

00:00:50.357 --> 00:00:55.093
into the word "Persia"
because just as the ancient

00:00:55.093 --> 00:00:58.608
Greeks did not refer to
where they lived as Greece

00:00:58.608 --> 00:01:02.617
that is a Latin idea of calling it Greece,

00:01:02.617 --> 00:01:07.124
the Greeks referred to where
they lived as "Hellas",

00:01:07.124 --> 00:01:08.883
it turns out that the
Persians did not refer

00:01:08.883 --> 00:01:11.296
to where they lived as "Persia".

00:01:11.296 --> 00:01:15.434
Their terms are actually
much closer to ideas around

00:01:15.434 --> 00:01:20.058
land of the Aryans, so
there's, based on my research,

00:01:20.058 --> 00:01:23.808
ideas like Aryan-Vega
and Aran-Shah and Aran.

00:01:25.659 --> 00:01:28.489
So it actually turns out
that the modern name of the

00:01:28.489 --> 00:01:33.281
country, the modern word Iran
is probably more appropriate

00:01:33.281 --> 00:01:37.503
or in some ways closer to
what the region has always

00:01:37.503 --> 00:01:41.066
called itself, what the
Iranians or the Persians have

00:01:41.066 --> 00:01:45.233
always called themselves,
and called where they lived.

00:01:46.434 --> 00:01:50.241
They referred to themselves
as the Aryans and where

00:01:50.241 --> 00:01:54.989
they lived as the Aryanan-Vega
or Aran, or Aran-Shah

00:01:54.989 --> 00:01:59.445
or some version of that and
the modern version is Iran.

00:01:59.445 --> 00:02:00.754
Now, with that said, you might say,

00:02:00.754 --> 00:02:04.024
"Well, why did the Greeks call it Persia?"

00:02:04.024 --> 00:02:07.630
Well, the Persian empire what
we consider to be the first

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:11.227
true Persian empire is the
Achaemenid empire, and we'll

00:02:11.227 --> 00:02:14.338
talk in a second why do we
call it even the Achaemenid,

00:02:14.338 --> 00:02:18.178
but the Achaemenid empire
emerges from a region

00:02:18.178 --> 00:02:22.384
of Persia, I guess we can
say, that in this map is

00:02:22.384 --> 00:02:26.148
referred to as Persus,
but other names for it are

00:02:26.148 --> 00:02:29.789
Pars, and even in modern
Iran there's a region called

00:02:29.789 --> 00:02:33.122
Fars which coincides very close with it.

00:02:33.975 --> 00:02:38.142
And since the leaders of the
Persian empire, and especially

00:02:39.086 --> 00:02:43.253
Cyrus the Great, emerged from
this region, they called them

00:02:44.651 --> 00:02:48.701
the Persians and it was the
"Persian" empire that emerges

00:02:48.701 --> 00:02:52.463
from this region which you
might wanna call Pars, Fars.

00:02:52.463 --> 00:02:55.241
Fars especially comes from
Arabic where they don't

00:02:55.241 --> 00:02:59.408
have the P sound, but Pars or
Persus or whatever you wanna

00:03:00.347 --> 00:03:04.514
call it, and that's why it
was called the Persian empire.

00:03:05.388 --> 00:03:09.476
Now, it wasn't the first
empire in that region.

00:03:09.476 --> 00:03:12.418
Before the Persian empire
gets established or what

00:03:12.418 --> 00:03:15.576
we associate with the Persian
or the Achaemenid empire

00:03:15.576 --> 00:03:19.166
of Cyrus the Great, much
of this region of where we

00:03:19.166 --> 00:03:21.916
call modern day Iran was
controlled by the Medians,

00:03:21.916 --> 00:03:26.849
and you can see Media is
this region right over here.

00:03:26.849 --> 00:03:31.644
And it was Cyrus the Great
that in 549, some accounts

00:03:31.644 --> 00:03:35.811
say 550 B.C.E., is able to
overthrow the Median emperor

00:03:37.001 --> 00:03:39.733
who happens to be his grandfather.

00:03:39.733 --> 00:03:44.342
And that is the really dawn
of the Achaemenid dynasty.

00:03:44.342 --> 00:03:46.427
Now the next question
and this was established,

00:03:46.427 --> 00:03:49.212
let me write this down, this
was established by Cyrus

00:03:49.212 --> 00:03:53.379
the Great, he was Cyrus the II
but he became Cyrus the Great

00:03:54.979 --> 00:03:58.210
because he was able to break
out and overthrow the Medians

00:03:58.210 --> 00:04:01.043
and establish this massive empire.

00:04:01.971 --> 00:04:04.345
And the reason why it's
called the Achaemenid empire

00:04:04.345 --> 00:04:08.512
not the Cyrid empire, is
that Cyrus claims to be from

00:04:12.442 --> 00:04:16.568
the family of the patriarch
Achaemenis and a lot of

00:04:16.568 --> 00:04:18.932
these names, these are
come from Greek accounts so

00:04:18.932 --> 00:04:21.543
that's why they sound a
little bit more Greek.

00:04:21.543 --> 00:04:26.455
But Achaemenis is a semi-legendary
figure that, we're not

00:04:26.455 --> 00:04:29.807
sure exactly when he lived,
but the best accounts I could

00:04:29.807 --> 00:04:34.273
see is near the beginning of
the seventh century B.C.E.

00:04:34.273 --> 00:04:37.970
And Cyrus the Great is
from Achaemenis' family,

00:04:37.970 --> 00:04:42.596
and so since they came to
power, this first really Persian

00:04:42.596 --> 00:04:44.801
empire, when the people talk
about the Persian empire

00:04:44.801 --> 00:04:47.494
they don't tend to refer to
the Median empire, they're

00:04:47.494 --> 00:04:49.327
really referring to the Achaemenid empire,

00:04:49.327 --> 00:04:52.140
that's why it's called Achaemenid.

00:04:52.140 --> 00:04:55.135
Now, in future videos we'll
talk more about what happened

00:04:55.135 --> 00:04:58.703
in the Achaemenid empire, but
you can see the extent of it

00:04:58.703 --> 00:05:02.962
was pretty significant and it
lasts for a little over 200

00:05:02.962 --> 00:05:06.277
years until they're
conquered by foreigners.

00:05:06.277 --> 00:05:09.102
And the foreigners that
conquer them are the Greeks.

00:05:09.102 --> 00:05:12.870
Philip of Macedon's son,
Alexander the Great, is able to,

00:05:12.870 --> 00:05:16.269
on some level, unify Greece and Persia.

00:05:16.269 --> 00:05:18.741
And it's interesting because
a lot of what we learn about

00:05:18.741 --> 00:05:21.705
ancient Persia, it's
accounts from the Greeks,

00:05:21.705 --> 00:05:25.030
from folks like Herodotus,
but during the time

00:05:25.030 --> 00:05:29.521
of classical Greece, Greece
was really a bit of a sideshow,

00:05:29.521 --> 00:05:32.573
it was really this kind of
thorn in the side of Persia.

00:05:32.573 --> 00:05:35.516
Persia was really where the power was.

00:05:35.516 --> 00:05:39.683
But as we get to the mid or
the end of the fourth century

00:05:41.292 --> 00:05:45.647
B.C.E., Persia weakens,
Greece unifies under Philip

00:05:45.647 --> 00:05:48.832
of Macedon and Alexander the
Great and Alexander the Great

00:05:48.832 --> 00:05:51.608
is able to conquer the Persian empire.

00:05:51.608 --> 00:05:54.020
And he is short-lived, we have
videos on Alexander the Great

00:05:54.020 --> 00:05:57.181
I encourage you to watch
them, his life is short-lived

00:05:57.181 --> 00:05:59.754
and his unified empire is
short-lived, but he has this

00:05:59.754 --> 00:06:03.546
dream of mixing the cultures
and really being a unified

00:06:03.546 --> 00:06:06.367
people, but as soon as he
dies his empire splits,

00:06:06.367 --> 00:06:09.882
but the Persian empire for the most part,

00:06:09.882 --> 00:06:12.751
is in the control of the Seleucid's.

00:06:12.751 --> 00:06:16.229
And the Seleucid dynasty, this
is essentially foreign rule

00:06:16.229 --> 00:06:19.947
'cause Seleucus, who
establishes Seleucid dynasty,

00:06:19.947 --> 00:06:22.852
he is one of Alexander's
generals, he's fundamentally

00:06:22.852 --> 00:06:26.397
Greek, and so the rulers of
the Seleucid dynasty are Greek.

00:06:26.397 --> 00:06:29.458
And you don't get back
to having Persian rule

00:06:29.458 --> 00:06:32.751
until 238 B.C.E.

00:06:32.751 --> 00:06:36.918
It's in 238 B.C.E. that the
Parthian's emerge to conquer

00:06:38.604 --> 00:06:40.855
the empire and so, once
again you could say,

00:06:40.855 --> 00:06:44.173
"Well, this is back to non-foreign rule."

00:06:44.173 --> 00:06:46.597
It's really important
to keep in mind, because

00:06:46.597 --> 00:06:50.815
in it's day the Achaemenid
empire was, if not the dominant,

00:06:50.815 --> 00:06:54.418
one of the very dominant
empires of the world.

00:06:54.418 --> 00:06:58.190
At it's peak it had a
population, this is roughly

00:06:58.190 --> 00:07:01.537
under Darius the Great, and
we'll talk more about him,

00:07:01.537 --> 00:07:03.876
he was an interesting
character, but the Achaemenid

00:07:03.876 --> 00:07:08.043
empire at it's peak had
approximately 50 million people.

00:07:09.114 --> 00:07:12.023
And that's a lot of people
at any time in history,

00:07:12.023 --> 00:07:13.457
but especially at that time in history

00:07:13.457 --> 00:07:15.213
because at that time in
history there was only

00:07:15.213 --> 00:07:17.870
a little over 100 million
people in the world,

00:07:17.870 --> 00:07:19.626
or at least that's our current estimates.

00:07:19.626 --> 00:07:22.408
So this is actually the largest
proportion of the world's

00:07:22.408 --> 00:07:27.322
population that any empire
has ever had in history,

00:07:27.322 --> 00:07:29.745
as far as we can tell, so
that gives it some claim

00:07:29.745 --> 00:07:32.910
to being maybe the greatest
or one of the greatest

00:07:32.910 --> 00:07:35.223
empires in world history.

00:07:35.223 --> 00:07:37.800
And then, as we get into
the Seleucid and especially

00:07:37.800 --> 00:07:40.502
the Parthian empire, you
know, in the West we talk

00:07:40.502 --> 00:07:42.924
a lot about the glory of the Roman empire,

00:07:42.924 --> 00:07:47.038
but the Parthian's were right
there beside of them, and

00:07:47.038 --> 00:07:51.240
they kind of went back and forth
but they were side by side,

00:07:51.240 --> 00:07:54.810
the peak of the Parthian
empire coincides with the peak

00:07:54.810 --> 00:07:57.251
of the Roman empire, and they
give each other space and

00:07:57.251 --> 00:08:00.650
they went back and forth
especially around the Middle East.

00:08:00.650 --> 00:08:03.630
And you have this empire
from the Parthian's you go to

00:08:03.630 --> 00:08:07.797
the Sassanian's and eventually
in the seventh century C.E.,

00:08:09.890 --> 00:08:12.398
Islam comes into the Persian empire

00:08:12.398 --> 00:08:14.281
and becomes the dominant religion.

00:08:14.281 --> 00:08:15.875
And so that might make you ask,

00:08:15.875 --> 00:08:18.738
"Well, what was the dominant
religion before that?"

00:08:18.738 --> 00:08:22.600
And the answer there is Zoroastrianism.

00:08:22.600 --> 00:08:25.683
Zoroastrianism.

00:08:29.318 --> 00:08:32.705
And it was really Cyrus
the Great, by establishing

00:08:32.705 --> 00:08:36.720
the Persian empire, who
really spreads Zoroastrianism.

00:08:36.720 --> 00:08:40.893
And Zoroastrianism is based
on their prophet Zarathustra.

00:08:40.893 --> 00:08:44.042
And when Zarathustra lived is
up for some debate, it might

00:08:44.042 --> 00:08:47.719
be as early as 1500 B.C.E.,
some people say it might

00:08:47.719 --> 00:08:51.932
be even right before even
coincident with the life

00:08:51.932 --> 00:08:53.979
of Cyrus the Great, so
there's some debate on when

00:08:53.979 --> 00:08:58.146
Zarathustra lived, but it
was a monotheistic religion,

00:08:59.127 --> 00:09:02.210
following the one god of Ahura Mazda.

00:09:07.625 --> 00:09:09.443
Ahura Mazda.

00:09:09.443 --> 00:09:12.755
And it was based on these
ideas of good thoughts lead

00:09:12.755 --> 00:09:15.416
to good words and good deeds.

00:09:15.416 --> 00:09:18.776
Other big ideas of the
Persian empire is their system

00:09:18.776 --> 00:09:20.947
of governments, of governants.

00:09:20.947 --> 00:09:25.047
Because it was such a
vast empire they delegated

00:09:25.047 --> 00:09:27.881
the emperor, the Shah and
Shah, the King of Kings,

00:09:27.881 --> 00:09:31.286
delegated authority to the
regions so each region,

00:09:31.286 --> 00:09:35.203
each satrapy had it's
governor called a satrap.

00:09:37.872 --> 00:09:40.124
And as we see over time, some
of these satraps got more

00:09:40.124 --> 00:09:43.973
power then maybe was intended
and then eventually took over.

00:09:43.973 --> 00:09:47.654
But this was a major empire
in the history of the world,

00:09:47.654 --> 00:09:51.821
they unified people, they're
famous for royal road

00:09:52.720 --> 00:09:57.619
that connected Sardis all the
way, all the way to Sousa,

00:09:57.619 --> 00:10:00.643
as you can imagine it would
have facilitated the transfer

00:10:00.643 --> 00:10:02.979
of knowledge and the transfer of trade.

00:10:02.979 --> 00:10:05.396
Under the Seleucid's you
had huge Greek influence,

00:10:05.396 --> 00:10:06.789
but it was two way street.

00:10:06.789 --> 00:10:09.331
Not only did the Greeks
influence the Persians,

00:10:09.331 --> 00:10:13.148
but the Persians heavily
influenced the Greeks.

00:10:13.148 --> 00:10:15.149
So with that, in the next
few videos we'll go into

00:10:15.149 --> 00:10:18.557
even more depth on the Persian empire

00:10:18.557 --> 00:10:21.390
and specifically the Achaemenid's.
