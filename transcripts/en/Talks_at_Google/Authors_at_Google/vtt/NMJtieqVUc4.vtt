00:00:01.604 --> 00:00:03.270
MALE SPEAKER: We're
really pleased today

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:07.160
to have Theodore Gray from
my alma mater, University

00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:09.445
of Illinois, here today.

00:00:09.445 --> 00:00:12.390
Theo is the author of
"The Elements-- A Visual

00:00:12.390 --> 00:00:14.590
Explanation," which some
of you probably have.

00:00:14.590 --> 00:00:16.780
He has about 1 million
copies in print,

00:00:16.780 --> 00:00:23.850
and he also is the co-founder
of Wolfram Research, 1987.

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:26.156
Are you working on
WolframAlpha now or--

00:00:26.156 --> 00:00:27.530
THEODORE GRAY:
Yeah, not anymore.

00:00:27.530 --> 00:00:29.510
MALE SPEAKER: Not anymore.

00:00:29.510 --> 00:00:32.750
So today he's got
an exciting new book

00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:35.190
I can't wait to read on
"Molecules-- the Elements

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:37.210
and the Architecture
of Everything."

00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:39.431
So please welcome Theodore Gray.

00:00:39.431 --> 00:00:41.886
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:43.965 --> 00:00:44.840
THEODORE GRAY: Hello.

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:49.160
So I put up the cat slide.

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:52.630
I added this after my first
talk on this book tour

00:00:52.630 --> 00:00:54.840
because right before
the very first talk

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:56.650
that I gave on this
book tour, this kid

00:00:56.650 --> 00:00:58.000
came up with his phone.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:00:59.477
And he was very
excited to show me

00:00:59.477 --> 00:01:01.810
a picture of this cat, because
this is the cat that he's

00:01:01.810 --> 00:01:04.890
named after me, because
he's such a big fan.

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:07.760
It's like, well, I guess
it's downhill from here.

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:09.052
[LAUGHTER]

00:01:10.410 --> 00:01:13.520
Anyway, so actually, how many
of you have my "Elements" book

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:14.610
or have seen it?

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:18.775
So that's quite a few--
maybe just a very quick recap

00:01:18.775 --> 00:01:23.770
of how I ended up in
this line of work.

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:25.270
There's this book,
"Uncle Tungsten."

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:27.600
So if you like my book, you'll
definitely like this one.

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:28.349
It's a great book.

00:01:28.349 --> 00:01:30.600
It's by Oliver Sacks.

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:32.952
And he talks about
this periodic table

00:01:32.952 --> 00:01:35.160
that he used to visit in
the Science Museum in London

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:35.990
when he was a kid.

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:37.650
And when I was reading
this, I thought

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:41.030
he meant a table that was in
the shape of the periodic table.

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:43.960
And I thought that was
just the coolest idea ever.

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:45.930
And then I read along
a little further

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:50.005
and discovered that actually,
no, it's just a wall display,

00:01:50.005 --> 00:01:52.820
same as everybody else's, and it
was kind of confusingly worded.

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:55.570
But that gave me
the idea that there

00:01:55.570 --> 00:01:58.410
ought to be a periodic table.

00:01:58.410 --> 00:02:00.730
So I ended up building
this periodic table,

00:02:00.730 --> 00:02:03.355
and for various
reasons that don't

00:02:03.355 --> 00:02:04.480
make a whole lot of sense--

00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:04.920
[CELLPHONE VIBRATING]

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:05.240
What?

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:06.156
Somebody's calling me.

00:02:06.156 --> 00:02:08.430
That's not going to work.

00:02:08.430 --> 00:02:11.870
So because of some
technicalities

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:15.660
in how I built it, it ended up
with each of the little element

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:18.730
tiles that are engraved with
the information being loose,

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:20.870
with a little
compartment underneath.

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:24.290
And because of that, I thought
I could get some elements

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:26.190
and put them into
those compartments

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:28.130
and collect elements.

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:30.470
And then I discovered
eBay, which was just

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:32.760
kind of coming into its
own around that time--

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:35.660
this was like 2002 or so.

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:38.240
And the whole
enterprise has been

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:40.755
a series of slippery slopes
and maybe a little bit

00:02:40.755 --> 00:02:42.130
poor decision-making
or something

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:43.960
because it just kind
of got out of hand.

00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:47.250
And I've since actually had
to add two more display cases,

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:51.450
so far, to hold the
various elements .

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:54.284
Then Oliver Sacks heard
about this and the fact

00:02:54.284 --> 00:02:56.200
that it was his fault
that I built this table.

00:02:56.200 --> 00:02:59.310
And so he came to visit
it, and that was cool.

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:01.900
And then I got this thing
called the Ig Nobel Prize,

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:03.910
which is awarded for
achievements that cannot

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:07.550
or should not be replicated,
which I think it was pretty

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:10.310
much the only honor for which
a periodic table table is

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:12.790
actually eligible.

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:14.590
And so I made a crappy website.

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:17.261
And then I got a call
from "Popular Science"

00:03:17.261 --> 00:03:19.010
who said would you
like to write a column?

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:21.370
So I ended up spending
literally 10 years

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:24.160
writing a column for
"Popular Science."

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:28.340
And I'll tell you in a little
bit why I stopped doing that.

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:29.930
So that was like
one page every month

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:32.242
about some random topic
in chemistry or science

00:03:32.242 --> 00:03:33.200
or something like that.

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:35.626
It turned into two
books-- "Mad Science" is

00:03:35.626 --> 00:03:38.000
the first five years. "Mad
Science 2" was the second five

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:38.499
years.

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:42.030
I improved my website.

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:45.040
I got periodictable.com,
which is a beautiful URL.

00:03:48.350 --> 00:03:51.290
Anyway, so when I started
collecting these elements,

00:03:51.290 --> 00:03:53.899
I realized if I don't
take a picture of each one

00:03:53.899 --> 00:03:55.440
and write a little
description of it,

00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:57.070
I'm going to forget
what they are.

00:03:57.070 --> 00:03:59.780
There's just no way that
I'm going to remember 50--

00:03:59.780 --> 00:04:03.860
let alone 500 or 3,000,
currently-- different element

00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:05.370
samples.

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:08.000
So I started photographing them,
and I kind of got into that

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:09.150
and started doing
it a little better.

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:11.640
And eventually, I ended up with
a set of photographs like this.

00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:13.530
And I thought, well,
I should make a poster

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:15.570
because periodic tables
are kind of boring.

00:04:15.570 --> 00:04:21.769
And so I published this poster
right before Christmas 2005

00:04:21.769 --> 00:04:24.640
or 2006, something like that.

00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:26.020
And that did pretty well.

00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:27.770
People liked it.

00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:29.950
And then at some
point, I thought, well,

00:04:29.950 --> 00:04:31.160
I guess I have enough.

00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:34.800
I could probably write a
little bit about each element.

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:38.550
And I've got several different
samples about each element,

00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:41.407
so I should make a
book, because I'm not

00:04:41.407 --> 00:04:42.740
making any money on the website.

00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:44.864
I was making like
$300 or $400 a month

00:04:44.864 --> 00:04:46.280
on Google Ads,
which is very nice.

00:04:46.280 --> 00:04:47.120
Thank you, Google.

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:50.810
But it's not that
exciting in terms

00:04:50.810 --> 00:04:52.685
of putting more work into it.

00:04:52.685 --> 00:04:54.310
Although I understand
Simon has friends

00:04:54.310 --> 00:04:58.160
who make a good bit more
than that on similar science

00:04:58.160 --> 00:04:59.209
sorts of themed websites.

00:04:59.209 --> 00:05:01.250
But nevertheless, I thought
a book would be good,

00:05:01.250 --> 00:05:04.270
because a book you can put
it in paper and can sell it.

00:05:04.270 --> 00:05:07.280
And so this now has, as of this
summer, about a million copies

00:05:07.280 --> 00:05:09.610
in print in 23 languages,
which is very nice.

00:05:13.380 --> 00:05:15.650
What people who look at the
print book don't realize

00:05:15.650 --> 00:05:17.560
is that at some point,
rather than just

00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:19.360
taking a picture
of each thing, I

00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:21.970
started putting each
thing on a turntable

00:05:21.970 --> 00:05:26.165
and doing a VR rotation of
it, where we do a photograph

00:05:26.165 --> 00:05:29.230
from every angle all
the way around, so

00:05:29.230 --> 00:05:32.010
that I could actually start
doing things like this.

00:05:32.010 --> 00:05:34.250
But the problem was
that there wasn't really

00:05:34.250 --> 00:05:38.920
any platform on which it seemed
realistic to use this imagery.

00:05:38.920 --> 00:05:41.370
You can't print it,
because it's paper.

00:05:41.370 --> 00:05:45.730
And you can't really sell it
as desktop computer software.

00:05:45.730 --> 00:05:47.630
It just didn't make
a whole lot of sense.

00:05:47.630 --> 00:05:52.630
But fortunately, Steve Jobs
had this semi-annual descent

00:05:52.630 --> 00:05:54.770
from a higher plane to
hand the world a thing

00:05:54.770 --> 00:05:58.320
that they didn't know that
they needed it, but couldn't

00:05:58.320 --> 00:05:59.030
live without.

00:05:59.030 --> 00:06:04.840
And just a few months after we
came out with the print book,

00:06:04.840 --> 00:06:06.410
the iPad was announced.

00:06:06.410 --> 00:06:09.210
And I thought, wow, that
is exactly what I need.

00:06:09.210 --> 00:06:12.864
I could make an ebook in
which all the objects-- so

00:06:12.864 --> 00:06:15.030
in the actual ebook, you
spin them with your finger.

00:06:15.030 --> 00:06:17.071
They're not just continuously
animated like that.

00:06:17.071 --> 00:06:18.550
You just take each
one and spin it.

00:06:18.550 --> 00:06:22.590
And through various reasons
to do with Wolfram Research

00:06:22.590 --> 00:06:24.410
more so than science
writing, we actually

00:06:24.410 --> 00:06:26.940
had a prototype iPad for
the two-month interval

00:06:26.940 --> 00:06:31.380
between the announcement and
the ship date of the iPad, which

00:06:31.380 --> 00:06:34.037
was a deep dark
secret at the time.

00:06:34.037 --> 00:06:36.120
But it was fun, because
it meant we could actually

00:06:36.120 --> 00:06:39.100
do a pretty good job of
developing this software

00:06:39.100 --> 00:06:41.510
and releasing it as an
iPad app simultaneously

00:06:41.510 --> 00:06:44.000
with the launch of the iPad.

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:48.990
And that's done really
well, because it's

00:06:48.990 --> 00:06:53.470
very good for Apple, and
it's in their TV commercials.

00:06:53.470 --> 00:06:57.110
We're going to skip the Japanese
elements song because-- we're

00:06:57.110 --> 00:07:01.400
just going to, because some
of you may have heard it

00:07:01.400 --> 00:07:02.400
and some of you may not.

00:07:02.400 --> 00:07:06.350
Either way, we don't
need to play it again.

00:07:06.350 --> 00:07:08.580
So that led to me
starting a company

00:07:08.580 --> 00:07:13.790
called Touchpress, which is an
iPad app publishing company.

00:07:13.790 --> 00:07:17.230
Sorry, no Android at the moment.

00:07:17.230 --> 00:07:19.060
And we've published
20 or so apps.

00:07:19.060 --> 00:07:21.390
The reason I stopped doing
my "Popular Science" column

00:07:21.390 --> 00:07:24.330
is because we did this thing
called "Disney Animated," which

00:07:24.330 --> 00:07:26.770
was iPad App of
the Year last year.

00:07:26.770 --> 00:07:28.395
And through a series
of what I consider

00:07:28.395 --> 00:07:30.920
a very poor decision-making
process on the part of Disney,

00:07:30.920 --> 00:07:33.880
they decided that I should
be the author of the ebook

00:07:33.880 --> 00:07:37.750
component of that app, as well
as the designer of the thing.

00:07:37.750 --> 00:07:39.810
And when I was
growing up, I wasn't

00:07:39.810 --> 00:07:42.660
allowed to watch Disney movies,
because my parents considered

00:07:42.660 --> 00:07:43.590
them kind of lowbrow.

00:07:43.590 --> 00:07:45.970
And so I really knew absolutely
nothing about Disney.

00:07:45.970 --> 00:07:49.240
So I had to spend a year
indoctrinating myself

00:07:49.240 --> 00:07:51.316
with everything Disney,
and it was kind of fun.

00:07:51.316 --> 00:07:52.690
I got to talk to
all these people

00:07:52.690 --> 00:07:58.190
and develop the
zeal of the convert,

00:07:58.190 --> 00:08:02.420
because I'm new to all this,
and it's all so amazing.

00:08:02.420 --> 00:08:04.710
And so we made
this app about it.

00:08:04.710 --> 00:08:08.100
And that ended in me
basically blowing off

00:08:08.100 --> 00:08:10.240
"Popular Science" for so
long that they eventually

00:08:10.240 --> 00:08:12.770
decided I'm not a reliable
columnist anymore.

00:08:12.770 --> 00:08:15.100
And now I don't write
that column anymore.

00:08:15.100 --> 00:08:16.920
But as a trade-off,
we got iPad App

00:08:16.920 --> 00:08:20.290
of the Year, which was cool.

00:08:20.290 --> 00:08:22.610
So I spent several years
being kind of distracted,

00:08:22.610 --> 00:08:26.170
making essentially
other people's apps.

00:08:26.170 --> 00:08:27.760
And I decided a
little over a year ago

00:08:27.760 --> 00:08:28.850
that I'm done with that.

00:08:28.850 --> 00:08:32.659
I'm going to go back and write
the second in the trilogy

00:08:32.659 --> 00:08:34.880
that I had intended to do
from the very beginning

00:08:34.880 --> 00:08:38.770
with "Elements"-- elements,
molecules, reactions.

00:08:38.770 --> 00:08:41.630
There's a fourth in the trilogy,
which has become necessary

00:08:41.630 --> 00:08:43.820
because "Molecules"
doesn't cover

00:08:43.820 --> 00:08:45.320
biological macromolecules.

00:08:45.320 --> 00:08:47.615
So it will actually be a
four-part trilogy eventually.

00:08:50.390 --> 00:08:53.060
So yeah, so I started
on "Molecules,"

00:08:53.060 --> 00:08:55.149
and that's what
I'm here for now.

00:08:55.149 --> 00:08:56.690
And so now I'm going
to just tell you

00:08:56.690 --> 00:08:58.540
some random stories out
of the "Molecules"--

00:08:58.540 --> 00:09:00.370
things that I think
are interesting.

00:09:00.370 --> 00:09:03.901
We start with this slide, which
actually made more sense when

00:09:03.901 --> 00:09:05.650
I was giving this talk
jointly with-- this

00:09:05.650 --> 00:09:08.120
is my girlfriend,
Nina Paley-- who

00:09:08.120 --> 00:09:10.650
has outstanding
Van de Graaf hair.

00:09:10.650 --> 00:09:13.170
It's the best I've ever seen.

00:09:13.170 --> 00:09:15.560
So that's an illustration
of static electricity, which

00:09:15.560 --> 00:09:18.390
is what holds molecules
together, essentially.

00:09:18.390 --> 00:09:20.400
It's the electrostatic
force that

00:09:20.400 --> 00:09:22.660
is keeping these things
all knitted together.

00:09:22.660 --> 00:09:24.630
And it's also an
illustration of the fact

00:09:24.630 --> 00:09:27.854
that I do a lot of
things involving thread.

00:09:27.854 --> 00:09:30.020
We have these giant
computerized embroidery machines

00:09:30.020 --> 00:09:32.260
and quilting machines.

00:09:32.260 --> 00:09:34.050
And the first story
is about thread.

00:09:34.050 --> 00:09:36.495
So this is cotton.

00:09:36.495 --> 00:09:39.210
This is what you pick if
you're out picking cotton.

00:09:39.210 --> 00:09:41.020
And there's little
fibers in there.

00:09:41.020 --> 00:09:43.645
All the fibers in a cotton
plant are about an inch long,

00:09:43.645 --> 00:09:45.970
and each one has a
tiny seed at the end.

00:09:45.970 --> 00:09:50.150
And this is a 6,000 yard
cone of cotton thread.

00:09:50.150 --> 00:09:53.077
So 6,000 yards, that's
about 3 and 1/2 miles.

00:09:53.077 --> 00:09:54.160
It's actually quite small.

00:09:54.160 --> 00:09:56.790
It's the standard commercial
size cone of thread.

00:09:56.790 --> 00:09:59.570
And all the fibers in it
are still only an inch long.

00:09:59.570 --> 00:10:01.460
They don't glue them
together or anything.

00:10:01.460 --> 00:10:04.390
The only thing holding
it together is the twist.

00:10:04.390 --> 00:10:07.590
And if you untwist
it very carefully,

00:10:07.590 --> 00:10:12.020
you can actually separate the
thread and nothing breaks.

00:10:12.020 --> 00:10:14.917
You don't break any
fibers when you take apart

00:10:14.917 --> 00:10:17.250
a cotton thread like that,
because they weren't fastened

00:10:17.250 --> 00:10:19.190
to each other in
the first place.

00:10:19.190 --> 00:10:21.760
And this turns out to
be an excellent analogy

00:10:21.760 --> 00:10:25.270
to the way certain polymers
hold each other together.

00:10:25.270 --> 00:10:28.440
Polyethylene, for example-- this
is a highly schematic drawing

00:10:28.440 --> 00:10:31.530
of polyethylene--
and the connections

00:10:31.530 --> 00:10:34.440
down the carbon backbone of a
polyethylene molecule like this

00:10:34.440 --> 00:10:36.220
are very, very strong.

00:10:36.220 --> 00:10:39.130
But the forces between
the polyethylene molecules

00:10:39.130 --> 00:10:40.310
are quite weak.

00:10:40.310 --> 00:10:43.400
They're van der Waals
forces, and they're not

00:10:43.400 --> 00:10:44.990
really bonded to each other.

00:10:44.990 --> 00:10:47.460
And they can actually
slide quite easily.

00:10:47.460 --> 00:10:50.340
So if you have a plastic
grocery bag, for example,

00:10:50.340 --> 00:10:53.774
you can tear it
apart quite easily.

00:10:53.774 --> 00:10:55.440
And for the most part,
you aren't really

00:10:55.440 --> 00:10:56.870
breaking those carbon bonds.

00:10:56.870 --> 00:11:01.470
You're more like just separating
the molecules from each other.

00:11:01.470 --> 00:11:04.250
But if you instead kind
of pull it in such a way

00:11:04.250 --> 00:11:07.640
that it stretches
linearly and becomes

00:11:07.640 --> 00:11:11.390
kind of more like a fiber,
there's a very specific point

00:11:11.390 --> 00:11:13.010
as you're stretching
it-- it deforms.

00:11:13.010 --> 00:11:15.780
Then it stretches,
and then it stops.

00:11:15.780 --> 00:11:17.600
And it becomes much stronger.

00:11:17.600 --> 00:11:20.780
And it's like it cuts into your
finger, and you can't tear it.

00:11:20.780 --> 00:11:23.057
And you realize you have to
pull it apart and tear it

00:11:23.057 --> 00:11:24.640
the other way because
it's too strong.

00:11:24.640 --> 00:11:27.160
That's the point at which
the polyethylene molecules

00:11:27.160 --> 00:11:32.180
have lined up with each other
and are now interlocking

00:11:32.180 --> 00:11:35.590
in much the way that the fibers
in the cotton thread interlock.

00:11:35.590 --> 00:11:37.190
And the strength
that you're feeling

00:11:37.190 --> 00:11:39.450
is the strength of the
carbon-carbon bond that

00:11:39.450 --> 00:11:42.920
goes down the backbone
of those molecules.

00:11:42.920 --> 00:11:48.301
It's actually quite unusual
to be able to directly feel

00:11:48.301 --> 00:11:50.550
forces like that, and it
happens because the molecules

00:11:50.550 --> 00:11:51.758
are lined up with each other.

00:11:51.758 --> 00:11:54.260
And if you take longer
polyethylene chains--

00:11:54.260 --> 00:11:56.600
this is ultra high molecular
weight polyethylene--

00:11:56.600 --> 00:12:01.250
it's maybe 500,000 carbon units
long versus just a few thousand

00:12:01.250 --> 00:12:02.199
in a grocery bag.

00:12:02.199 --> 00:12:03.740
And you stretch that
into fibers, you

00:12:03.740 --> 00:12:05.970
end up with a fiber
called Dyneema,

00:12:05.970 --> 00:12:08.750
which is ordinary polyethylene.

00:12:08.750 --> 00:12:10.500
But it's among the
strongest known fibers.

00:12:10.500 --> 00:12:12.125
It's stronger than
Kevlar, for example.

00:12:14.830 --> 00:12:19.680
Speaking of which,
so Kevlar is strong

00:12:19.680 --> 00:12:22.430
not because the
chains are very long.

00:12:22.430 --> 00:12:25.210
But because they're actually
kind of sticky in the same way

00:12:25.210 --> 00:12:27.580
that cotton fibers are
rough on the surface

00:12:27.580 --> 00:12:30.080
and, therefore, kind
of stick to each other.

00:12:30.080 --> 00:12:34.640
These benzene rings down the
back of a Kevlar polymer,

00:12:34.640 --> 00:12:38.350
they tend to stick
a little stronger.

00:12:38.350 --> 00:12:40.310
You can go one
step further, which

00:12:40.310 --> 00:12:42.907
is to actually glue
the metaphorical fibers

00:12:42.907 --> 00:12:43.490
to each other.

00:12:43.490 --> 00:12:48.394
So this is cross-linked
latex rubber-- vulcanized

00:12:48.394 --> 00:12:49.310
rubber, as it's known.

00:12:49.310 --> 00:12:51.840
You take this natural
rubber, and you treat it

00:12:51.840 --> 00:12:53.250
with sulfur and heat.

00:12:53.250 --> 00:12:57.764
And you build sulfur bridges
between the polymer molecules.

00:12:57.764 --> 00:12:59.430
And when you do that,
you're essentially

00:12:59.430 --> 00:13:00.720
turning them into one molecule.

00:13:00.720 --> 00:13:02.136
So I have a page
in my book called

00:13:02.136 --> 00:13:04.935
"A Shoe-Shaped Molecule,"
because I did my due diligence.

00:13:04.935 --> 00:13:06.810
I did some back of the
envelope calculations.

00:13:06.810 --> 00:13:08.780
I talked to a couple
of polymer chemists,

00:13:08.780 --> 00:13:11.530
and we agreed that
chances are you

00:13:11.530 --> 00:13:14.160
could make a defensible argument
that in a vulcanized rubber

00:13:14.160 --> 00:13:16.770
shoe like that, there's
at least one sulfur

00:13:16.770 --> 00:13:21.114
link from every molecule
to every other one.

00:13:21.114 --> 00:13:23.030
And therefore, the whole
thing is one molecule

00:13:23.030 --> 00:13:24.909
that's shaped like a shoe.

00:13:24.909 --> 00:13:26.450
And I thought that
was kind of funny,

00:13:26.450 --> 00:13:28.910
so I called the page "The
Shoe-Shaped Molecule."

00:13:28.910 --> 00:13:31.700
And then I gave a talk
about three weeks ago

00:13:31.700 --> 00:13:33.837
to a group of chemical
engineers in Seattle.

00:13:33.837 --> 00:13:35.920
And I asked them, well,
you're chemical engineers.

00:13:35.920 --> 00:13:36.669
What do you think?

00:13:36.669 --> 00:13:37.737
Is it one molecule?

00:13:37.737 --> 00:13:39.320
And this guy raised
his hand and said,

00:13:39.320 --> 00:13:41.560
well, I used to work for Nike.

00:13:41.560 --> 00:13:45.180
And we studied vulcanized
rubber shoe soles

00:13:45.180 --> 00:13:47.930
and particularly investigated
the question of how much of it

00:13:47.930 --> 00:13:50.480
is formed into one molecule
versus how much is still

00:13:50.480 --> 00:13:52.020
solubilized.

00:13:52.020 --> 00:13:57.440
And he said, no, it's probably
only about 80% one molecule,

00:13:57.440 --> 00:14:01.840
and about 20% of it is
not connected to that.

00:14:01.840 --> 00:14:04.630
And it's like, Jesus,
what are the chances

00:14:04.630 --> 00:14:07.486
that you have a chemical
engineer who specifically

00:14:07.486 --> 00:14:12.910
studied the question of
vulcanized rubber shoe soles

00:14:12.910 --> 00:14:15.069
and calls you out on that?

00:14:15.069 --> 00:14:16.860
I haven't quite decided
yet exactly how I'm

00:14:16.860 --> 00:14:19.210
going to fix that
page, but it's going

00:14:19.210 --> 00:14:21.860
to have to be fixed somehow.

00:14:21.860 --> 00:14:23.260
Anyway, back to the cellulose.

00:14:23.260 --> 00:14:24.960
So this is the
cellulose polymer,

00:14:24.960 --> 00:14:26.830
and like all simple
polymers, it's

00:14:26.830 --> 00:14:29.710
repeating unit over
and over again.

00:14:29.710 --> 00:14:32.270
And as some of you may know,
the repeating unit in cellulose

00:14:32.270 --> 00:14:36.260
is glucose-- sugar.

00:14:36.260 --> 00:14:38.010
And the only reason
it doesn't taste sweet

00:14:38.010 --> 00:14:40.420
is because we don't have
any kind of chemical process

00:14:40.420 --> 00:14:42.100
in our stomach
that's able to break

00:14:42.100 --> 00:14:44.390
the bonds between
the glucose units.

00:14:44.390 --> 00:14:47.120
They're connected in a way
that we don't break up.

00:14:47.120 --> 00:14:50.000
And so if you eat
grass, it doesn't work.

00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:53.850
And if you want to extract the
chemical energy in the sugars

00:14:53.850 --> 00:14:56.720
from cellulose, you need a
different chemical process,

00:14:56.720 --> 00:14:59.960
which is called cattle-ranching,
where you feed it to cows.

00:14:59.960 --> 00:15:04.299
And then you eat the cows
or the milk or whatever.

00:15:04.299 --> 00:15:05.090
The energy's there.

00:15:05.090 --> 00:15:07.250
You just have to get
it out appropriately.

00:15:07.250 --> 00:15:09.200
So this is two forms of sugar.

00:15:09.200 --> 00:15:11.160
The one on the left
is 100% glucose.

00:15:11.160 --> 00:15:14.820
The one on the right
is 50% glucose,

00:15:14.820 --> 00:15:16.850
because the one on
the left is cotton,

00:15:16.850 --> 00:15:19.150
and the one on the
right is cotton candy,

00:15:19.150 --> 00:15:22.000
which is made of sucrose,
which is glucose plus fructose.

00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:24.490
That's a disaccharide.

00:15:24.490 --> 00:15:27.480
I just put that in there,
because it's funny.

00:15:27.480 --> 00:15:29.800
So cellulose is something
which is made of pure sugar,

00:15:29.800 --> 00:15:31.490
but isn't sweet.

00:15:31.490 --> 00:15:35.457
There's other things which are
sweet but not made of sugar.

00:15:35.457 --> 00:15:37.040
So saccharin's been
around long enough

00:15:37.040 --> 00:15:38.930
that there are antique
saccharin artifacts.

00:15:38.930 --> 00:15:41.714
This is a saccharin bowl
on top of a sugar bowl.

00:15:41.714 --> 00:15:44.380
You notice the saccharin bowl is
much smaller, because you don't

00:15:44.380 --> 00:15:45.963
need very much
saccharin, because it's

00:15:45.963 --> 00:15:48.504
much more intensely
sweet than sugar.

00:15:48.504 --> 00:15:50.420
And there would be these
little tiny pellets--

00:15:50.420 --> 00:15:51.920
little tiny
tweezers-- that people

00:15:51.920 --> 00:15:53.836
would use to take out
little bits of saccharin

00:15:53.836 --> 00:15:56.297
and put them in their coffee.

00:15:56.297 --> 00:15:57.880
But there's things
that are much, much

00:15:57.880 --> 00:16:00.540
sweeter than saccharin.

00:16:00.540 --> 00:16:03.900
So this is 100 pounds
of sugar that I got,

00:16:03.900 --> 00:16:04.910
surprisingly expensive.

00:16:04.910 --> 00:16:13.400
So it's 170,000 calories,
14,000% of your daily carb

00:16:13.400 --> 00:16:15.230
requirements.

00:16:15.230 --> 00:16:19.080
And balanced on top, you
can see a tiny little Petri

00:16:19.080 --> 00:16:21.390
dish, which we'll zoom in on.

00:16:21.390 --> 00:16:23.770
That's 4 and 1/2
grams of neotame,

00:16:23.770 --> 00:16:27.990
which is the sweetest
FDA-approved artificial

00:16:27.990 --> 00:16:29.510
sweetener.

00:16:29.510 --> 00:16:31.910
It's about 300 times
sweeter than NutraSweet,

00:16:31.910 --> 00:16:33.440
which it's chemically
derived from.

00:16:33.440 --> 00:16:36.350
It's basically NutraSweet plus
a little side chain on it.

00:16:36.350 --> 00:16:38.350
10,000 times sweeter
than sugar, depending

00:16:38.350 --> 00:16:41.210
on exactly what
you mean by that.

00:16:41.210 --> 00:16:42.980
But anyway, so that
4 and 1/2 grams

00:16:42.980 --> 00:16:45.690
is roughly equivalent in
sweetness to the sugar.

00:16:45.690 --> 00:16:47.380
And this stuff, I
highly recommend it.

00:16:47.380 --> 00:16:49.939
You can get like 10 grams
on eBay for about $70,

00:16:49.939 --> 00:16:52.480
which is worth it, because it's
all the sweetness you'll ever

00:16:52.480 --> 00:16:53.850
need.

00:16:53.850 --> 00:16:59.500
And if you ever wonder about
how chemical contamination

00:16:59.500 --> 00:17:01.640
or particularly
radioactive contamination

00:17:01.640 --> 00:17:04.420
can happen where the
quantities are similarly small,

00:17:04.420 --> 00:17:05.970
I got this packet.

00:17:05.970 --> 00:17:08.060
It's like a foil
packet, 10 grams.

00:17:08.060 --> 00:17:10.109
I opened it up to measure
out the 4 and 1/2 grams

00:17:10.109 --> 00:17:11.700
that I calculated I needed.

00:17:11.700 --> 00:17:15.790
And within seconds of carefully
and gently opening the packet,

00:17:15.790 --> 00:17:18.460
I was tasting sweet in
the back of my throat.

00:17:18.460 --> 00:17:22.380
And I didn't puff it or
stir it up or whatever.

00:17:22.380 --> 00:17:28.020
I just slowly opened the packet,
and some completely invisible

00:17:28.020 --> 00:17:31.225
tiny quantity of this fine
powder-- I had waffed it up,

00:17:31.225 --> 00:17:32.100
and I was tasting it.

00:17:32.100 --> 00:17:34.680
And the next morning
after taking a shower,

00:17:34.680 --> 00:17:40.130
I could lick my beard and taste
sweet on it from-- this stuff

00:17:40.130 --> 00:17:43.180
is unbelievably intensely sweet.

00:17:43.180 --> 00:17:45.350
And it gets on
everything immediately,

00:17:45.350 --> 00:17:47.440
because it's a very fine powder.

00:17:47.440 --> 00:17:49.690
And so it's like you'd
be a little bit worried

00:17:49.690 --> 00:17:52.736
about chemicals like
that getting out.

00:17:52.736 --> 00:17:54.110
I mean, it's like
I'm tasting it,

00:17:54.110 --> 00:17:56.732
this chemical that
I was just handling.

00:17:56.732 --> 00:17:59.190
And particularly, people worry
about artificial sweeteners,

00:17:59.190 --> 00:18:03.491
like should you be eating
aspartame, for example?

00:18:03.491 --> 00:18:04.990
Which I do in very
large quantities,

00:18:04.990 --> 00:18:07.894
because I drink
nothing but Diet Coke.

00:18:07.894 --> 00:18:09.310
And so I did a
little calculation,

00:18:09.310 --> 00:18:12.290
like what level of
exposure are you getting?

00:18:12.290 --> 00:18:15.977
Say you were to take an
appropriate amount of neotame

00:18:15.977 --> 00:18:17.560
and sweeten the cup
of coffee with it,

00:18:17.560 --> 00:18:21.090
the equivalent sweetness
that you would typically use.

00:18:21.090 --> 00:18:24.120
And what if it were
as toxic as the most

00:18:24.120 --> 00:18:28.292
toxic known synthetic compound,
which is VX nerve agent?

00:18:28.292 --> 00:18:29.750
And it turns out
you would actually

00:18:29.750 --> 00:18:32.690
be several times below
the LD50 of VX nerve

00:18:32.690 --> 00:18:36.170
agent in the quantity of
neotame that you used.

00:18:36.170 --> 00:18:37.930
So you'd probably survive.

00:18:37.930 --> 00:18:40.190
You'd have a pretty high
probability actually

00:18:40.190 --> 00:18:45.550
of surviving, even if it were as
poisonous as the most poisonous

00:18:45.550 --> 00:18:48.190
known synthetic substance.

00:18:48.190 --> 00:18:49.870
And that kind of
colors my attitude

00:18:49.870 --> 00:18:51.370
about a number of
chemicals when you

00:18:51.370 --> 00:18:54.630
think about just how little
it is that you actually

00:18:54.630 --> 00:18:56.980
are using, especially with
artificial sweeteners, which

00:18:56.980 --> 00:19:00.412
are very high intensity things.

00:19:00.412 --> 00:19:02.120
And then there's also
always the question

00:19:02.120 --> 00:19:03.460
of natural versus synthetic.

00:19:03.460 --> 00:19:05.321
So two of these are synthetic.

00:19:05.321 --> 00:19:06.320
Two of them are natural.

00:19:06.320 --> 00:19:07.986
You can tell the
difference, by the way.

00:19:07.986 --> 00:19:09.580
The natural
chemicals, very often,

00:19:09.580 --> 00:19:11.660
are hugely more complicated.

00:19:11.660 --> 00:19:14.540
Like to synthesize
Stevia or mogroside,

00:19:14.540 --> 00:19:17.330
that would be a hugely
complicated synthesis

00:19:17.330 --> 00:19:18.320
nobody would try.

00:19:18.320 --> 00:19:23.810
So we tend to make much
simpler, smaller molecules,

00:19:23.810 --> 00:19:25.110
like, for example, saccharin.

00:19:25.110 --> 00:19:28.680
So here's a fact you may
not know about Sweet 'N Low.

00:19:28.680 --> 00:19:32.010
Saccharin is so sweet that
the amount of saccharin

00:19:32.010 --> 00:19:34.050
that you need to put
in a cup of coffee

00:19:34.050 --> 00:19:36.260
is impractically
small, like it would

00:19:36.260 --> 00:19:38.390
be a few grains of salt amount.

00:19:38.390 --> 00:19:40.750
And so the packet is
actually mostly filler.

00:19:40.750 --> 00:19:43.760
It's about 6% saccharin
and 94% filler.

00:19:43.760 --> 00:19:46.850
You want to guess
what the filler is?

00:19:46.850 --> 00:19:48.790
Glucose.

00:19:48.790 --> 00:19:51.840
Dextrose-- nutritive dextrose
is what it's listed as,

00:19:51.840 --> 00:19:54.680
but that's an exact
synonym for glucose.

00:19:54.680 --> 00:19:57.389
And you notice how it
says "zero calorie" on it.

00:19:57.389 --> 00:19:59.430
You may wonder how does
it say zero calorie on it

00:19:59.430 --> 00:20:01.807
if it's basically pure sugar?

00:20:01.807 --> 00:20:04.140
And the answer is because
there's an FDA regulation that

00:20:04.140 --> 00:20:06.940
says you can round calories
to the nearest five calories.

00:20:06.940 --> 00:20:09.920
If it's less than five,
you can round down.

00:20:09.920 --> 00:20:11.160
So it's one gram of glucose.

00:20:11.160 --> 00:20:13.035
There's four calories
in one gram of glucose.

00:20:16.329 --> 00:20:17.370
So this is the situation.

00:20:17.370 --> 00:20:19.900
So I'm slightly diabetic,
you know, borderline.

00:20:19.900 --> 00:20:21.430
I shouldn't be eating sugar.

00:20:21.430 --> 00:20:23.980
And I think it's just
absolutely outrageous

00:20:23.980 --> 00:20:26.520
that this natural
chemical is allowed

00:20:26.520 --> 00:20:29.740
to contaminate the pure
clean synthetic that I

00:20:29.740 --> 00:20:32.530
was looking for.

00:20:32.530 --> 00:20:33.580
I want saccharin.

00:20:33.580 --> 00:20:35.070
I don't want sugar.

00:20:35.070 --> 00:20:35.870
Sugar's bad for me.

00:20:35.870 --> 00:20:37.800
Sugar is unhealthy.

00:20:37.800 --> 00:20:41.420
The tiny little bit of saccharin
that's in there, that's great.

00:20:41.420 --> 00:20:44.010
Even California no longer has
the saccharin warning on it

00:20:44.010 --> 00:20:45.511
that many of you may remember.

00:20:45.511 --> 00:20:48.010
And the reason is because they
actually figured out not only

00:20:48.010 --> 00:20:50.030
that it doesn't
actually cause cancer,

00:20:50.030 --> 00:20:53.040
but why it was mistakenly
thought to cause cancer,

00:20:53.040 --> 00:20:55.440
like the mechanism by
which that mistake was made

00:20:55.440 --> 00:20:57.354
was thoroughly understood.

00:20:57.354 --> 00:20:59.020
So much so, that even
California took it

00:20:59.020 --> 00:21:02.510
off that famous list of
chemicals known to California.

00:21:02.510 --> 00:21:05.620
But that un-banning
of saccharin is still

00:21:05.620 --> 00:21:07.040
rippling throughout the world.

00:21:07.040 --> 00:21:10.310
So this is a seemingly identical
packet of Sweet 'N Low,

00:21:10.310 --> 00:21:12.387
but this one's from Canada.

00:21:12.387 --> 00:21:14.720
And if you look carefully,
it's sweetened with cyclamate

00:21:14.720 --> 00:21:17.260
because saccharin is
still banned in Canada.

00:21:17.260 --> 00:21:19.530
Cyclamate is still
banned in the US

00:21:19.530 --> 00:21:21.950
for the same sort
of residual reason.

00:21:21.950 --> 00:21:25.100
And so we have mutually
illegal Sweet 'N Lows

00:21:25.100 --> 00:21:26.845
between the US and Canada.

00:21:26.845 --> 00:21:29.479
They're both almost pure sugar.

00:21:29.479 --> 00:21:31.270
And in Europe, by the
way, which is usually

00:21:31.270 --> 00:21:33.790
much stricter about this,
both saccharin and cyclamate

00:21:33.790 --> 00:21:34.874
are legal now.

00:21:34.874 --> 00:21:36.540
And almost all these
sorts of sweeteners

00:21:36.540 --> 00:21:38.810
are a mixture of the two,
because they taste better

00:21:38.810 --> 00:21:39.620
together.

00:21:39.620 --> 00:21:42.745
And we'll get there.

00:21:42.745 --> 00:21:43.534
Oh, there we are.

00:21:43.534 --> 00:21:44.950
There's the Canadian
Sweet 'N Low.

00:21:44.950 --> 00:21:47.950
I was using the wrong slide.

00:21:47.950 --> 00:21:50.546
You can tell it's Canadian
because of the French.

00:21:50.546 --> 00:21:52.170
And if you look on
the back, you should

00:21:52.170 --> 00:21:55.450
be able to read the cyclamate
ingredient there somewhere--

00:21:55.450 --> 00:21:57.050
sodium cyclamate.

00:21:57.050 --> 00:21:58.850
Anyway, so at this
point, lest I sound

00:21:58.850 --> 00:22:02.310
like a shill for the chemical
industry, I want to show you

00:22:02.310 --> 00:22:03.820
a synthetic chemical
I don't think

00:22:03.820 --> 00:22:07.250
should be used as an
artificial sweetener.

00:22:07.250 --> 00:22:10.990
So this was most recently
used on a large scale

00:22:10.990 --> 00:22:13.610
as an artificial sweetener
by the Romans, who knew it

00:22:13.610 --> 00:22:17.060
under its alchemical
name of "sugar of lead."

00:22:17.060 --> 00:22:20.030
The modern name is lead
acetate, and it's no longer

00:22:20.030 --> 00:22:22.330
used as a sweetener
because it's lead.

00:22:22.330 --> 00:22:28.160
And there is no
quantity of lead that

00:22:28.160 --> 00:22:29.850
is known not to be dangerous.

00:22:29.850 --> 00:22:32.010
There's no lower safety
limit known for lead.

00:22:32.010 --> 00:22:33.110
It's really bad.

00:22:33.110 --> 00:22:35.025
You shouldn't be eating it.

00:22:35.025 --> 00:22:36.400
What's most
surprising, actually,

00:22:36.400 --> 00:22:40.110
is that this brand and
a couple other brands

00:22:40.110 --> 00:22:43.000
of progressive hair dyes
for men use lead acetate

00:22:43.000 --> 00:22:43.995
as their pigment.

00:22:43.995 --> 00:22:46.120
And when your hair is being
darkened by this stuff,

00:22:46.120 --> 00:22:48.770
it's the accumulation
of lead in your hair

00:22:48.770 --> 00:22:50.560
that's causing that darkening.

00:22:50.560 --> 00:22:54.500
And the fact that
that's legal is bizarre.

00:22:54.500 --> 00:23:00.840
And it's an antique regulatory
leftover, banned in Europe,

00:23:00.840 --> 00:23:02.470
and being phased
out here, I think.

00:23:02.470 --> 00:23:03.970
Because even the
companies that make

00:23:03.970 --> 00:23:05.920
this stuff have realized
that this is probably

00:23:05.920 --> 00:23:07.100
not a great idea.

00:23:07.100 --> 00:23:08.730
And if you read
the FDA exemption

00:23:08.730 --> 00:23:12.850
for why lead acetate is allowed,
it's like, if you wear gloves,

00:23:12.850 --> 00:23:16.470
and if you engage in a
great many elaborate safety

00:23:16.470 --> 00:23:18.740
precautions, it's
hypothetically possible

00:23:18.740 --> 00:23:21.090
not to poison yourself
with the stuff.

00:23:21.090 --> 00:23:25.450
But realistically, not a good
idea, and definitely not as an

00:23:25.450 --> 00:23:27.860
artificial sweetener.

00:23:27.860 --> 00:23:29.975
But that's not because
it's a synthetic chemical.

00:23:29.975 --> 00:23:33.040
It's because it contains
lead, and lead is toxic.

00:23:33.040 --> 00:23:34.610
So this is another
example I like.

00:23:34.610 --> 00:23:35.860
This is black licorice, right?

00:23:35.860 --> 00:23:37.850
So black licorice, which
is not to be confused

00:23:37.850 --> 00:23:40.170
with red licorice, which
is not licorice at all.

00:23:40.170 --> 00:23:43.530
The real stuff-- the
principal flavor component

00:23:43.530 --> 00:23:46.490
is glycyrrhizin, which is toxic.

00:23:46.490 --> 00:23:49.360
It's quite significantly
toxic, to the point

00:23:49.360 --> 00:23:51.860
where if you-- I mean, it's
like several hundred grams a day

00:23:51.860 --> 00:23:53.610
over a period of many months.

00:23:53.610 --> 00:23:56.320
You would build up a
dose of glycyrrhizin

00:23:56.320 --> 00:24:00.180
which is at a level where
it's known to be toxic.

00:24:00.180 --> 00:24:02.740
It's kidney toxicity,
I think, primarily.

00:24:02.740 --> 00:24:05.920
If it were a synthetic chemical
artificial food ingredient,

00:24:05.920 --> 00:24:08.440
there's absolutely no way it
would ever have been permitted

00:24:08.440 --> 00:24:10.320
or it would have
been banned long ago.

00:24:10.320 --> 00:24:13.030
But because it's a
natural plant product,

00:24:13.030 --> 00:24:14.750
it's completely unregulated.

00:24:14.750 --> 00:24:16.760
There's no limitation
on the amount

00:24:16.760 --> 00:24:18.312
of the stuff that
can be in licorice.

00:24:18.312 --> 00:24:19.770
And there's actually
companies that

00:24:19.770 --> 00:24:23.150
advertise particularly strong
licorice for aficionados

00:24:23.150 --> 00:24:24.080
of licorice.

00:24:24.080 --> 00:24:27.600
And they're advertising the
degree-- the high concentration

00:24:27.600 --> 00:24:29.510
of toxic glycyrrhizin
that's in there.

00:24:29.510 --> 00:24:32.130
And that's fine, because it's
a plant extract and who cares?

00:24:32.130 --> 00:24:34.470
Must be good for you.

00:24:34.470 --> 00:24:38.172
Another one of my
favorite plant extracts--

00:24:38.172 --> 00:24:40.380
I happen to have a couple
of friends who had recently

00:24:40.380 --> 00:24:42.510
been to Peru, just
by coincidence,

00:24:42.510 --> 00:24:44.750
when I was working on this book.

00:24:44.750 --> 00:24:46.260
And they brought me back these.

00:24:46.260 --> 00:24:48.730
So one of them is coca
leaf tea, commonly

00:24:48.730 --> 00:24:50.360
available in tourist traps.

00:24:50.360 --> 00:24:53.850
And the thing on the
left is dried coca leaf,

00:24:53.850 --> 00:24:56.425
which you probably know that
the principle alkaloid component

00:24:56.425 --> 00:25:00.540
is cocaine, which is a
natural plant product.

00:25:00.540 --> 00:25:03.810
And it has its
pluses and minuses.

00:25:03.810 --> 00:25:07.200
I mean, as a topical
anesthetic, it

00:25:07.200 --> 00:25:09.810
was absolutely revolutionary.

00:25:09.810 --> 00:25:12.840
It was the first dental
anesthetic that really worked,

00:25:12.840 --> 00:25:16.280
and it continues to be used to
this day in medical practice

00:25:16.280 --> 00:25:19.500
as a topical anesthetic,
very effective.

00:25:19.500 --> 00:25:25.270
Of course, it also
has other uses.

00:25:25.270 --> 00:25:27.810
Although amusingly,
one of the problems

00:25:27.810 --> 00:25:30.037
with being a drug
addict is that you have,

00:25:30.037 --> 00:25:32.370
generally speaking, poor
medical care, and particularly,

00:25:32.370 --> 00:25:33.600
poor dental care.

00:25:33.600 --> 00:25:34.975
So you get a lot of toothaches.

00:25:34.975 --> 00:25:37.100
And doctors won't prescribe
pain medication for you

00:25:37.100 --> 00:25:40.050
because you're a drug addict,
and they won't do that.

00:25:40.050 --> 00:25:41.750
So it's widely known
to drug addicts

00:25:41.750 --> 00:25:44.520
that rubbing powder
cocaine on their gums

00:25:44.520 --> 00:25:48.050
is really effective as a
treatment for toothache.

00:25:48.050 --> 00:25:49.960
And in fact, it's
better pain management

00:25:49.960 --> 00:25:52.080
than most people get
from their doctor,

00:25:52.080 --> 00:25:53.580
because the doctor
is not legally

00:25:53.580 --> 00:25:57.220
allowed to prescribe
cocaine for toothaches.

00:25:57.220 --> 00:25:59.340
And it's by far the best
thing you could actually

00:25:59.340 --> 00:26:01.780
have for a toothache.

00:26:01.780 --> 00:26:05.190
But then there's the
downside that-- so this

00:26:05.190 --> 00:26:09.210
is a video of cooking
cocaine hydrochloride, which

00:26:09.210 --> 00:26:11.430
is how you get it
straight out of the plant

00:26:11.430 --> 00:26:13.800
into freebase cocaine, otherwise
known as crack cocaine.

00:26:13.800 --> 00:26:17.080
And I don't think we're going
to watch the entire process,

00:26:17.080 --> 00:26:19.720
but it's basically baking
soda and a lighter.

00:26:19.720 --> 00:26:22.350
And you turn this
thing which you

00:26:22.350 --> 00:26:26.140
can't smoke into
something you can smoke.

00:26:26.140 --> 00:26:28.740
And so here on the left,
that's a rock of crack cocaine.

00:26:28.740 --> 00:26:30.750
The thing on the right
is a rock of heroin.

00:26:30.750 --> 00:26:32.250
And the reason I put this
slide up with these two

00:26:32.250 --> 00:26:33.840
next to each other
is because it's

00:26:33.840 --> 00:26:39.190
a very good example of public
policy debates about chemicals.

00:26:39.190 --> 00:26:42.660
People have many
opinions about drugs.

00:26:42.660 --> 00:26:45.580
Is crack better for you
than heroin or vice versa?

00:26:45.580 --> 00:26:49.370
Or of all the different
things that you

00:26:49.370 --> 00:26:51.955
can debate about the
issues to do with drug use,

00:26:51.955 --> 00:26:53.330
the fact that the
one on the left

00:26:53.330 --> 00:26:55.663
is a natural plant extract,
whereas the one on the right

00:26:55.663 --> 00:26:57.962
is a synthetic chemical
never comes up.

00:26:57.962 --> 00:26:58.670
And why would it?

00:26:58.670 --> 00:27:00.940
Because it's just
completely irrelevant.

00:27:00.940 --> 00:27:02.212
Who cares?

00:27:02.212 --> 00:27:04.170
When you're talking about
substances like this,

00:27:04.170 --> 00:27:07.030
it makes absolutely
no difference

00:27:07.030 --> 00:27:10.250
whether it's natural
or synthetic.

00:27:10.250 --> 00:27:14.780
And yet, very often, that is
precisely the only content

00:27:14.780 --> 00:27:18.090
of public debate about the
relative merits of one chemical

00:27:18.090 --> 00:27:20.070
over another or whether
a certain chemical

00:27:20.070 --> 00:27:22.360
should be allowed.

00:27:22.360 --> 00:27:25.307
This came up last
year quite prominently

00:27:25.307 --> 00:27:26.890
in the case of
azodicarbonamide, which

00:27:26.890 --> 00:27:30.860
is a chemical that's used
in commercial bread baking,

00:27:30.860 --> 00:27:32.960
or at least used to be.

00:27:32.960 --> 00:27:35.640
And there was sort of
a big to-do about this.

00:27:35.640 --> 00:27:37.630
And Subway announced
that they were

00:27:37.630 --> 00:27:40.510
going to stop using
this in their dough.

00:27:40.510 --> 00:27:44.830
And when it's heated, it
turns into semicarbazide,

00:27:44.830 --> 00:27:47.720
and there's some evidence
that that might be harmful.

00:27:47.720 --> 00:27:50.540
Regulators in Europe are
looking at it in a sensible way

00:27:50.540 --> 00:27:53.150
to see whether it ought
to be permitted or not.

00:27:53.150 --> 00:27:55.190
But the public debate
in the US was entirely

00:27:55.190 --> 00:27:59.420
based on people repeating
over and over again

00:27:59.420 --> 00:28:02.640
that this chemical is used
to make rubber yoga mats.

00:28:02.640 --> 00:28:05.930
And why should
you use a chemical

00:28:05.930 --> 00:28:10.160
that's used to make rubber
yoga mats in your bread?

00:28:10.160 --> 00:28:12.480
Like, this is terrible,
and we should ban this.

00:28:12.480 --> 00:28:13.970
And Subway essentially
backed down

00:28:13.970 --> 00:28:17.000
and said, OK, we're
going to stop using it.

00:28:17.000 --> 00:28:20.180
And this is a dumb way
of debating chemicals.

00:28:20.180 --> 00:28:22.570
And I hope it doesn't go any
farther, because I happen

00:28:22.570 --> 00:28:26.750
to really like lye bread--
these little lye rolls.

00:28:26.750 --> 00:28:28.920
And the way you make lye
bread, it fundamentally

00:28:28.920 --> 00:28:31.910
involves the use of
lye, hence the name.

00:28:31.910 --> 00:28:33.850
Lye is another name
for sodium hydroxide.

00:28:33.850 --> 00:28:35.076
It's drain opener.

00:28:35.076 --> 00:28:36.450
If you're a crack
dealer, and you

00:28:36.450 --> 00:28:38.270
have a problem
with somebody, lye

00:28:38.270 --> 00:28:40.550
is what you use to
dispose of the bodies.

00:28:40.550 --> 00:28:45.450
So it's a very,
very nasty chemical.

00:28:45.450 --> 00:28:46.690
It's tremendously caustic.

00:28:46.690 --> 00:28:47.940
It's a drain opener.

00:28:47.940 --> 00:28:51.220
Should we be using drain
opener to make bread?

00:28:51.220 --> 00:28:52.257
Yes, absolutely.

00:28:52.257 --> 00:28:54.590
There's no reason not to use
drain opener to make bread,

00:28:54.590 --> 00:28:56.890
because the fact that you
can use a chemical for one

00:28:56.890 --> 00:29:00.400
thing or another has
nothing to do with it.

00:29:00.400 --> 00:29:02.110
The question is,
what is the chemical?

00:29:02.110 --> 00:29:02.700
Is it good for you?

00:29:02.700 --> 00:29:03.290
Is it harmful?

00:29:03.290 --> 00:29:04.300
How is it being used?

00:29:04.300 --> 00:29:05.460
What's the dose?

00:29:05.460 --> 00:29:08.760
All kinds of questions that
essentially didn't come up

00:29:08.760 --> 00:29:10.850
at all in the debate
about azodicarbonamide.

00:29:13.026 --> 00:29:14.650
And the fact is that
actually everybody

00:29:14.650 --> 00:29:17.491
loves chemicals, no
matter what they say.

00:29:17.491 --> 00:29:18.990
For example, if you
like asparagus--

00:29:18.990 --> 00:29:20.810
I happen to be particularly
fond of asparagus.

00:29:20.810 --> 00:29:22.730
If you like asparagus,
these are the chemicals

00:29:22.730 --> 00:29:25.629
that you particularly
like the taste of.

00:29:25.629 --> 00:29:27.420
If you like some other
food, I can give you

00:29:27.420 --> 00:29:30.880
another list of the chemicals
that you like the taste of.

00:29:30.880 --> 00:29:34.881
Many of these chemicals
are insecticides.

00:29:34.881 --> 00:29:36.280
They're pesticides.

00:29:36.280 --> 00:29:37.500
They're fungicides.

00:29:37.500 --> 00:29:39.630
They're antibacterial agents.

00:29:39.630 --> 00:29:41.230
None of them are
put there by us.

00:29:41.230 --> 00:29:43.660
They're put there by the
plant, because plants

00:29:43.660 --> 00:29:46.260
have this problem
that they're immobile.

00:29:46.260 --> 00:29:47.160
They can't move.

00:29:47.160 --> 00:29:49.147
Their only defense
is chemical warfare

00:29:49.147 --> 00:29:50.730
against being eaten
by various things.

00:29:50.730 --> 00:29:55.080
And so plants are actually
very active participants

00:29:55.080 --> 00:29:59.710
in the enterprise of
generating toxic chemicals.

00:29:59.710 --> 00:30:01.950
Actually, here's some
more random chemicals.

00:30:01.950 --> 00:30:03.490
You probably can't
read it there.

00:30:03.490 --> 00:30:07.310
This happens to list the colors
that are made by the plant

00:30:07.310 --> 00:30:11.980
to color themselves in this
way in each of these cases.

00:30:11.980 --> 00:30:17.560
And so plants spend a lot of
time making toxic chemicals.

00:30:17.560 --> 00:30:19.310
Here, for example,
these are the four most

00:30:19.310 --> 00:30:20.580
toxic known compounds.

00:30:20.580 --> 00:30:23.510
The top three are
all-natural products.

00:30:23.510 --> 00:30:26.640
The VX nerve agent
is number four.

00:30:26.640 --> 00:30:29.300
It's about 2,000
times less toxic

00:30:29.300 --> 00:30:31.380
than number one,
which is botulinum.

00:30:31.380 --> 00:30:32.910
Number two is
maitotoxin, which is

00:30:32.910 --> 00:30:34.860
made by a type of
marine plankton.

00:30:34.860 --> 00:30:39.980
Number three is the
poison dart frog poison.

00:30:39.980 --> 00:30:41.839
These are all-natural products.

00:30:41.839 --> 00:30:43.130
Plants are really good at that.

00:30:46.000 --> 00:30:50.300
And it's disconcerting,
disheartening,

00:30:50.300 --> 00:30:53.240
and sort of dysfunctional
to talk about chemicals

00:30:53.240 --> 00:30:58.750
so exclusively as, is it
artificial and therefore bad?

00:30:58.750 --> 00:31:01.105
Or is it natural
and therefore good?

00:31:01.105 --> 00:31:03.165
You get it wrong in
two different ways.

00:31:06.510 --> 00:31:09.010
So this is another project that
we worked on in Touchpress--

00:31:09.010 --> 00:31:13.410
a book about the whole
DNA exoneration enterprise

00:31:13.410 --> 00:31:16.270
that's now-- and has
been for some time

00:31:16.270 --> 00:31:19.420
now-- discovering these
tremendous injustices that

00:31:19.420 --> 00:31:24.430
happened decades ago,
people who were locked up.

00:31:24.430 --> 00:31:26.327
And one lesson from that
is the power of DNA.

00:31:26.327 --> 00:31:28.160
It turns out DNA is
really, really powerful,

00:31:28.160 --> 00:31:33.220
not just for solving crimes, but
for investigating many things.

00:31:33.220 --> 00:31:36.100
For example-- and the reason
I put the reference up there

00:31:36.100 --> 00:31:38.820
is because every
time I say this,

00:31:38.820 --> 00:31:40.330
I have trouble believing it.

00:31:40.330 --> 00:31:41.430
But go read the study.

00:31:41.430 --> 00:31:42.388
I read the whole thing.

00:31:42.388 --> 00:31:43.610
It's very thoroughly done.

00:31:43.610 --> 00:31:45.700
It's a totally legit study.

00:31:45.700 --> 00:31:47.510
What they did was
they investigated

00:31:47.510 --> 00:31:48.560
herbal supplements.

00:31:48.560 --> 00:31:50.500
They went out
around the country.

00:31:50.500 --> 00:31:54.420
They bought 40 or 50
different national brands

00:31:54.420 --> 00:31:56.720
of herbal supplements, and
they did DNA fingerprinting

00:31:56.720 --> 00:31:59.710
on the plant material that
was in those supplements.

00:31:59.710 --> 00:32:02.640
And then they compared-- they
went to botanical greenhouses

00:32:02.640 --> 00:32:06.200
and had experts
identify-- they made

00:32:06.200 --> 00:32:11.660
a library of DNA fingerprints
of herbs of known provenance,

00:32:11.660 --> 00:32:16.070
so they could very
authoritatively

00:32:16.070 --> 00:32:18.710
determine what's in those
supplements and what's not.

00:32:18.710 --> 00:32:21.847
And so not surprising, like 60%
or 65%, something like that,

00:32:21.847 --> 00:32:23.555
were found to contain
plant material that

00:32:23.555 --> 00:32:25.830
was not listed on the labels.

00:32:25.830 --> 00:32:26.560
Nobody's perfect.

00:32:26.560 --> 00:32:29.030
That doesn't seem
so shocking to me.

00:32:29.030 --> 00:32:31.470
What's more surprising
is over 30% of them

00:32:31.470 --> 00:32:33.800
contained none of any of
the listed ingredients

00:32:33.800 --> 00:32:38.370
at all-- none of any of
the listed ingredients.

00:32:38.370 --> 00:32:42.880
So to represent this in my
book-- because I did actually

00:32:42.880 --> 00:32:45.002
want to go out and buy an
herbal supplement pill,

00:32:45.002 --> 00:32:45.960
and there was no point.

00:32:45.960 --> 00:32:47.819
I just raked up some
leaves in the backyard

00:32:47.819 --> 00:32:49.860
and chopped them up and
put them in a pill, which

00:32:49.860 --> 00:32:51.640
is to say I did
exactly the same thing

00:32:51.640 --> 00:32:56.730
as 30% of the manufacturers
of these supplements.

00:32:56.730 --> 00:33:00.780
And the point is
that if you blindly

00:33:00.780 --> 00:33:02.950
believe claims of all-natural,
wholesome, you know,

00:33:02.950 --> 00:33:05.206
we're a small family
farm, you may actually

00:33:05.206 --> 00:33:07.080
be dealing with a
rapacious corporation based

00:33:07.080 --> 00:33:08.960
in New Jersey, which
is ripping you off.

00:33:08.960 --> 00:33:13.240
And it's not really
useful to apply skepticism

00:33:13.240 --> 00:33:15.110
because it's Monsanto,
but not because it's

00:33:15.110 --> 00:33:16.050
this friendly company.

00:33:16.050 --> 00:33:21.020
One ought to use
truth and mechanisms

00:33:21.020 --> 00:33:23.920
for actually finding the truth
to determine these things,

00:33:23.920 --> 00:33:28.370
rather than what essentially
amounts to prejudice,

00:33:28.370 --> 00:33:32.940
I think I'll skip this
particular example.

00:33:32.940 --> 00:33:36.050
Right, yeah, so let's
skip that example

00:33:36.050 --> 00:33:39.417
and go right on to the funniest
thing I know about vanilla,

00:33:39.417 --> 00:33:40.750
which is my last little example.

00:33:40.750 --> 00:33:42.964
And then we can have
little demos here.

00:33:42.964 --> 00:33:45.005
So, as you may know,
there's two kinds of vanilla

00:33:45.005 --> 00:33:46.046
you can get in the store.

00:33:46.046 --> 00:33:48.910
There's natural vanilla, and
there's artificial vanilla.

00:33:48.910 --> 00:33:51.437
And it turns out these
are chemically identical.

00:33:51.437 --> 00:33:53.520
It's the same vanilla, and
it's the same molecule.

00:33:53.520 --> 00:33:55.330
One is derived
from vanilla beans,

00:33:55.330 --> 00:33:57.629
and it's very
expensive because you

00:33:57.629 --> 00:33:58.920
have to grow the vanilla beans.

00:33:58.920 --> 00:34:00.920
They actually, apparently,
have to be pollinated

00:34:00.920 --> 00:34:03.607
by hand in a
rainforest plantation.

00:34:03.607 --> 00:34:05.065
And then they have
to be fermented,

00:34:05.065 --> 00:34:07.840
and it's quite expensive
to make natural vanilla.

00:34:07.840 --> 00:34:09.770
Synthetic vanilla, I
got a kilogram on eBay

00:34:09.770 --> 00:34:11.760
for like $20 or something.

00:34:11.760 --> 00:34:14.120
It's a trivial chemical
to synthesize, dirt cheap.

00:34:14.120 --> 00:34:17.250
And this, of course, means
there's a tremendous temptation

00:34:17.250 --> 00:34:23.520
for companies to adulterate
and to sell artificial vanilla

00:34:23.520 --> 00:34:26.175
calling it natural, because
there's huge profit to be made.

00:34:26.175 --> 00:34:27.550
And there's no
chemical test that

00:34:27.550 --> 00:34:29.020
can determine the difference.

00:34:29.020 --> 00:34:34.150
It's impossible to
apply any chemical test.

00:34:34.150 --> 00:34:36.650
But you can tell the difference.

00:34:36.650 --> 00:34:40.659
And the way you do it
is based on carbon-14.

00:34:40.659 --> 00:34:44.509
As you may know, the atmosphere
is full of carbon-14--

00:34:44.509 --> 00:34:46.050
well, tiny amounts,
but anyway-- it's

00:34:46.050 --> 00:34:48.752
incorporated by plants into
their cells when they grow.

00:34:48.752 --> 00:34:50.960
And it then very slowly
decays over tens of thousands

00:34:50.960 --> 00:34:53.570
of years.

00:34:53.570 --> 00:34:55.060
Natural vanilla is
made from plants

00:34:55.060 --> 00:34:57.790
that grew quite recently.

00:34:57.790 --> 00:35:00.200
Artificial vanilla is made
from petroleum feedstocks,

00:35:00.200 --> 00:35:01.350
which is also plants.

00:35:01.350 --> 00:35:03.959
But the plants grew
a very long time ago.

00:35:03.959 --> 00:35:05.750
And so the carbon-14
is completely decayed.

00:35:05.750 --> 00:35:08.410
So the way you tell is that
natural vanilla is radioactive,

00:35:08.410 --> 00:35:12.300
whereas synthetic
vanilla is not.

00:35:12.300 --> 00:35:15.290
And this is actually
how this is detected

00:35:15.290 --> 00:35:16.570
in the commercial trade.

00:35:16.570 --> 00:35:21.530
If the carbon-14 date of your
vanilla is too old, it's fake.

00:35:21.530 --> 00:35:24.632
In other words, if it's not
radioactive enough, it's fake.

00:35:24.632 --> 00:35:26.840
Which I just think is, I
don't know, for some reason,

00:35:26.840 --> 00:35:27.990
I think that's very funny--

00:35:27.990 --> 00:35:29.700
[LAUGHTER]

00:35:29.700 --> 00:35:34.340
--and a good example of the
use of science to find truth.

00:35:34.340 --> 00:35:38.190
Anyway, so these
are all my books,

00:35:38.190 --> 00:35:40.060
which you should all buy.

00:35:40.060 --> 00:35:43.150
Then I want to do two things.

00:35:43.150 --> 00:35:46.220
I want to show you
a preview-- now

00:35:46.220 --> 00:35:48.860
it's, I guess it's a release
candidate beta version

00:35:48.860 --> 00:35:53.360
something on there in between
of the "Molecules" app.

00:35:53.360 --> 00:35:55.584
And then I have a couple
of demonstrations.

00:35:55.584 --> 00:35:57.810
OK, yeah, so this
is the-- and like

00:35:57.810 --> 00:35:59.750
I say, unfortunately,
no Android,

00:35:59.750 --> 00:36:03.620
but maybe you guys can
talk me into it someday.

00:36:03.620 --> 00:36:14.180
The iPad version of "Molecules",
so it has things in it.

00:36:14.180 --> 00:36:15.070
You can spin them.

00:36:18.710 --> 00:36:25.330
Let's see If we go to
here, unlike on "Elements,"

00:36:25.330 --> 00:36:29.090
it has a larger number of
what I refer to as "still life

00:36:29.090 --> 00:36:31.805
video," which is kind of an
aesthetic I've been developing.

00:36:31.805 --> 00:36:35.300
So these are little things
that move when you touch them.

00:36:35.300 --> 00:36:37.440
They're not really videos,
but they are video,

00:36:37.440 --> 00:36:40.120
and they kind of
exist on the page.

00:36:40.120 --> 00:36:42.710
And they're meant to
illustrate, in this case,

00:36:42.710 --> 00:36:47.470
the different viscosity between
longer and shorter hydrocarbon

00:36:47.470 --> 00:36:50.590
chains, respectively.

00:36:50.590 --> 00:36:53.890
But the thing that's really
interesting in this app

00:36:53.890 --> 00:36:58.580
is something that you
really have not seen before.

00:36:58.580 --> 00:37:02.420
I'm trying to find the
right place to-- yeah,

00:37:02.420 --> 00:37:04.940
so here's a good one.

00:37:04.940 --> 00:37:06.785
So when you see these
diagrams of molecules.

00:37:06.785 --> 00:37:08.700
I mean, you've seen
them everywhere, right?

00:37:08.700 --> 00:37:10.130
These are all lies.

00:37:10.130 --> 00:37:13.060
Molecules are not flat
things like that on paper.

00:37:13.060 --> 00:37:15.750
And if you've seen 3D
renderings of molecules

00:37:15.750 --> 00:37:19.620
or plastic 3D models of
molecules, those are lies, too.

00:37:19.620 --> 00:37:20.980
Because-- I mean they're closer.

00:37:20.980 --> 00:37:22.620
Molecules are
three-dimensional things,

00:37:22.620 --> 00:37:25.420
but they aren't
rigid things at all.

00:37:25.420 --> 00:37:30.070
This is actually what
molecules really look like.

00:37:30.070 --> 00:37:33.480
They're, generally
speaking, very flexible,

00:37:33.480 --> 00:37:37.620
floppy things that are
in constant motion.

00:37:37.620 --> 00:37:39.120
They're always vibrating.

00:37:39.120 --> 00:37:40.910
And so what we have
in the "Molecules" app

00:37:40.910 --> 00:37:45.440
is this high-end piece of
molecular dynamic simulation

00:37:45.440 --> 00:37:48.390
software that's normally
a supercomputer thing,

00:37:48.390 --> 00:37:50.470
but we're doing it
with small molecules.

00:37:50.470 --> 00:37:53.550
And it's doing quantum
mechanics guided

00:37:53.550 --> 00:37:58.990
simulation, legitimate molecular
dynamic simulation of what

00:37:58.990 --> 00:38:00.670
these molecules
are actually like

00:38:00.670 --> 00:38:01.900
with multi-touch interface.

00:38:01.900 --> 00:38:03.730
So you can pick
up separate parts

00:38:03.730 --> 00:38:08.415
of the molecule simultaneously
and kind of stretch it out.

00:38:08.415 --> 00:38:15.050
I actually managed to-- if you
go to that maitotoxin, which

00:38:15.050 --> 00:38:19.980
is an amazing multifused
ring structure-- we'll

00:38:19.980 --> 00:38:21.240
get it in here somewhere.

00:38:25.460 --> 00:38:28.252
So yeah, if you zoom
in, it's just one ring

00:38:28.252 --> 00:38:30.460
after another, all different
sizes, the kind of thing

00:38:30.460 --> 00:38:35.080
that only biology can
synthesize molecules like this.

00:38:35.080 --> 00:38:36.960
And I managed to
tie it in a knot.

00:38:36.960 --> 00:38:39.230
It takes about a minute
or two to do this,

00:38:39.230 --> 00:38:40.990
but you can actually
pick this thing up

00:38:40.990 --> 00:38:44.910
and very slowly-- the
simulation's a little slow--

00:38:44.910 --> 00:38:50.994
but you can actually drag this
thing out and tie a knot in it.

00:38:50.994 --> 00:38:53.410
Anyway, I think this is going
to be quite interesting when

00:38:53.410 --> 00:38:56.480
a large number of people get
to actually see and experience

00:38:56.480 --> 00:39:03.105
what molecules are like
as living, moving things.

00:39:03.105 --> 00:39:03.980
But it's not out yet.

00:39:03.980 --> 00:39:06.021
It will be out next week
or maybe the week after.

00:39:06.021 --> 00:39:09.410
I think the week after.

00:39:09.410 --> 00:39:11.400
OK.

00:39:11.400 --> 00:39:16.210
And now, we have just
a couple of demos.

00:39:16.210 --> 00:39:20.757
We'll leave this one for last,
in case it's the last demo.

00:39:20.757 --> 00:39:22.811
[LAUGHTER]

00:39:22.811 --> 00:39:23.310
OK.

00:39:23.310 --> 00:39:26.310
So the first one
is along the lines

00:39:26.310 --> 00:39:29.140
of telling real from fake.

00:39:29.140 --> 00:39:32.879
So I don't do the kind of
really spectacular science demos

00:39:32.879 --> 00:39:33.920
that people sometimes do.

00:39:33.920 --> 00:39:37.520
So I try to have some
kind of relevance to them.

00:39:37.520 --> 00:39:39.190
And this one is
practical advice on how

00:39:39.190 --> 00:39:41.520
to tell real silk
from fake silk.

00:39:41.520 --> 00:39:45.510
It turns out that fake silk
is actually incredibly good

00:39:45.510 --> 00:39:46.080
these days.

00:39:46.080 --> 00:39:49.560
And even experts can't
really reliably tell

00:39:49.560 --> 00:39:54.310
just by feeling it
whether it's real or not.

00:39:54.310 --> 00:39:58.200
Because there's enough variation
in what real silk is like.

00:39:58.200 --> 00:40:00.190
And the imitations
are good enough

00:40:00.190 --> 00:40:02.460
that you need a better way.

00:40:02.460 --> 00:40:04.960
And obviously, you can do
chemical analyses or whatever.

00:40:04.960 --> 00:40:06.670
But there's a much
simpler way, which

00:40:06.670 --> 00:40:08.860
is to simply burn a bit of it.

00:40:08.860 --> 00:40:10.820
And apparently, if
you're a silk buyer

00:40:10.820 --> 00:40:15.300
and you're evaluating
something, that's how you do it,

00:40:15.300 --> 00:40:16.670
is you take a lighter along.

00:40:16.670 --> 00:40:18.710
And you pull a little
thread out of the garment,

00:40:18.710 --> 00:40:19.530
and you light it.

00:40:19.530 --> 00:40:21.060
And so I read about
this, and I was

00:40:21.060 --> 00:40:25.180
thinking it sounds pretty clear,
but how does it really look?

00:40:25.180 --> 00:40:27.680
And so I'll give you now
a practical demonstration

00:40:27.680 --> 00:40:30.960
of how you tell what
it actually looks like.

00:40:30.960 --> 00:40:35.860
And thank you, Simon,
for this fine torch.

00:40:35.860 --> 00:40:37.500
So you burn it,
and if it's silk--

00:40:37.500 --> 00:40:39.700
you see how it kind of melts?

00:40:39.700 --> 00:40:42.290
It actually pulls
back a little bit,

00:40:42.290 --> 00:40:46.352
but then it always puts
itself out-- eventually.

00:40:46.352 --> 00:40:48.310
And this is the point
where we'll all find out.

00:40:48.310 --> 00:40:53.050
And it leaves a char behind.

00:40:53.050 --> 00:40:54.980
There's a black
char, and it smells

00:40:54.980 --> 00:40:59.180
of burning hair--
terrible smell.

00:40:59.180 --> 00:40:59.740
Synthetic.

00:40:59.740 --> 00:41:02.260
So this is, I believe
this is nylon.

00:41:02.260 --> 00:41:03.190
It feels really nice.

00:41:03.190 --> 00:41:05.920
It's a beautiful rope.

00:41:05.920 --> 00:41:07.790
Now when you burn
this-- and this will

00:41:07.790 --> 00:41:12.710
be true of any synthetic
imitation silk-- first of all,

00:41:12.710 --> 00:41:15.620
it melts much more.

00:41:15.620 --> 00:41:22.030
And when it does eventually
catch fire-- yeah,

00:41:22.030 --> 00:41:25.640
that is absolutely
diagnostic of fake silk, when

00:41:25.640 --> 00:41:29.580
you have the dripping flaming
balls of death falling down.

00:41:32.200 --> 00:41:34.920
That's not silk.

00:41:34.920 --> 00:41:36.377
But it's also much
more attractive

00:41:36.377 --> 00:41:37.460
really in a darkened room.

00:41:37.460 --> 00:41:39.510
That's kind of fun.

00:41:42.675 --> 00:41:44.175
Oh, oh, and right,
and you can hear.

00:41:44.175 --> 00:41:45.591
I don't know if
you can hear that.

00:41:45.591 --> 00:41:46.228
Let me see.

00:41:53.490 --> 00:41:54.986
Anyway, this is
really a fun demo

00:41:54.986 --> 00:41:57.235
to do when the kids are not
there, because they learn.

00:42:00.440 --> 00:42:04.356
OK, now we can hopefully
get this to go out.

00:42:04.356 --> 00:42:06.470
AUDIENCE: Spray some
hair spray on it.

00:42:06.470 --> 00:42:09.090
THEODORE GRAY: Yeah,
that will probably work.

00:42:09.090 --> 00:42:10.400
OK.

00:42:10.400 --> 00:42:12.250
So there's a whole
section in the book,

00:42:12.250 --> 00:42:13.470
and in particular on
the app, it's good.

00:42:13.470 --> 00:42:16.180
There's a whole section of lots
of different fibers burning,

00:42:16.180 --> 00:42:18.880
and it's quite
attractive, the ways

00:42:18.880 --> 00:42:20.780
in which different
types of fibers burn.

00:42:20.780 --> 00:42:23.000
Some of them burn
very differently.

00:42:23.000 --> 00:42:26.330
Cotton balls burn in
a very beautiful way.

00:42:26.330 --> 00:42:28.440
Kevlar doesn't burn at all.

00:42:28.440 --> 00:42:31.360
And then, of course, there's the
whole natural versus synthetic.

00:42:31.360 --> 00:42:35.170
But one of the more
surprising things that burns

00:42:35.170 --> 00:42:37.490
is actually steel wool.

00:42:37.490 --> 00:42:41.140
You might not think of
steel or iron as flammable.

00:42:41.140 --> 00:42:43.860
And normally it isn't,
but only because normally,

00:42:43.860 --> 00:42:46.530
when you have some of it,
it's a big chunk of it

00:42:46.530 --> 00:42:51.210
with a substantial volume
versus surface area.

00:42:51.210 --> 00:42:53.730
But if you have fine
steel wool like this,

00:42:53.730 --> 00:42:55.897
it has very little volume
and a lot of surface area.

00:42:55.897 --> 00:42:58.396
And it turns out it's actually--
and we should at this point

00:42:58.396 --> 00:43:00.335
turn off the lights,
if that's possible.

00:43:00.335 --> 00:43:01.680
Does anybody know how
to turn off the-- oh,

00:43:01.680 --> 00:43:02.680
there's a bunch of light
switches over here.

00:43:02.680 --> 00:43:04.090
AUDIENCE: Right there.

00:43:04.090 --> 00:43:04.500
THEODORE GRAY: Ah, can you?

00:43:04.500 --> 00:43:05.375
AUDIENCE: Over there.

00:43:07.895 --> 00:43:09.020
THEODORE GRAY: There we go.

00:43:09.020 --> 00:43:10.350
Perfect, OK.

00:43:10.350 --> 00:43:13.524
Oh, great.

00:43:13.524 --> 00:43:15.440
Yeah, so it turns out
that steel wool actually

00:43:15.440 --> 00:43:18.654
burns very nicely, and
it's quite attractive

00:43:18.654 --> 00:43:21.972
when it works right.

00:43:21.972 --> 00:43:25.200
I just light it
here, and then you

00:43:25.200 --> 00:43:30.730
get this lovely kind of little
worms of fire coming up.

00:43:30.730 --> 00:43:35.460
And you notice that it's
different from most kinds

00:43:35.460 --> 00:43:37.900
of fire that you see, because
the fire is happening right

00:43:37.900 --> 00:43:39.421
on the surface of the metal.

00:43:39.421 --> 00:43:41.920
Normally, when you have wood
burning or something like that,

00:43:41.920 --> 00:43:43.540
the fire is above the wood.

00:43:43.540 --> 00:43:45.373
And that's because
what's actually happening

00:43:45.373 --> 00:43:47.159
is that the wood
is volatilizing,

00:43:47.159 --> 00:43:48.950
and there's flammable
gases that are going.

00:43:48.950 --> 00:43:50.200
Well, it's the gas
above that's really

00:43:50.200 --> 00:43:51.400
doing most of the burning.

00:43:51.400 --> 00:43:53.150
But here, nothing
volatilizes, and there's

00:43:53.150 --> 00:43:56.720
no smoke, other than a tiny bit
from residual oil on the steel

00:43:56.720 --> 00:43:57.221
wool.

00:43:57.221 --> 00:43:58.720
Because what's
happening is the iron

00:43:58.720 --> 00:44:02.000
is being converted in
place into iron oxide.

00:44:02.000 --> 00:44:04.180
And, actually, what's
happening, this is rusting.

00:44:04.180 --> 00:44:07.600
This is just high-speed rust.

00:44:07.600 --> 00:44:09.430
And rusting is a very
exothermic process.

00:44:09.430 --> 00:44:12.630
And it when happens fast
enough, things get hot,

00:44:12.630 --> 00:44:15.350
and then we call it fire.

00:44:15.350 --> 00:44:18.490
But really, it's just rusting.

00:44:18.490 --> 00:44:20.990
And it puts itself out, because
there's not much left to do.

00:44:24.602 --> 00:44:25.810
We'll just let that burn out.

00:44:25.810 --> 00:44:27.976
You can turn the-- I guess
you could leave them off.

00:44:27.976 --> 00:44:29.230
I don't know.

00:44:29.230 --> 00:44:31.230
So one of the
chapters in the book

00:44:31.230 --> 00:44:33.680
is called "I Hate
That Molecule," which

00:44:33.680 --> 00:44:35.350
I hate that title.

00:44:35.350 --> 00:44:37.559
I think that's a really
stupid title for the chapter.

00:44:37.559 --> 00:44:39.849
What I really wanted to call
it is "Molecules That Piss

00:44:39.849 --> 00:44:41.280
People Off," but
they wouldn't let

00:44:41.280 --> 00:44:45.270
me do that, because
children and all.

00:44:45.270 --> 00:44:48.310
And so that's a
chapter about molecules

00:44:48.310 --> 00:44:52.550
which just cause people to be
angry about something or other

00:44:52.550 --> 00:44:54.976
and cause there to
be hate in the world.

00:44:54.976 --> 00:44:56.350
And the number
one molecule there

00:44:56.350 --> 00:45:01.980
is thimerosal, because of the
whole anti-vaccination deal,

00:45:01.980 --> 00:45:04.049
which whatever side
of that you're on--

00:45:04.049 --> 00:45:05.840
and I hope you're on
pro-vaccination side--

00:45:05.840 --> 00:45:08.110
but either way, people
get really angry.

00:45:08.110 --> 00:45:12.400
People call each other
murderers and whatever.

00:45:12.400 --> 00:45:14.295
Another class of
compounds that's on there

00:45:14.295 --> 00:45:16.110
is chlorofluorocarbons.

00:45:16.110 --> 00:45:17.626
So that debate is
kind of over now.

00:45:17.626 --> 00:45:20.000
And actually, I was just
reading just after the book went

00:45:20.000 --> 00:45:21.830
to press that for
the first time,

00:45:21.830 --> 00:45:24.010
the ozone hole is
getting better again now.

00:45:24.010 --> 00:45:26.170
It's like there's actually
been some progress

00:45:26.170 --> 00:45:29.400
in atmospheric science.

00:45:29.400 --> 00:45:34.090
But there was a time when
there was tremendous discord

00:45:34.090 --> 00:45:36.970
about that and people
calling each other names.

00:45:39.480 --> 00:45:41.200
And one of the
arguments that was made

00:45:41.200 --> 00:45:44.060
is that chlorofluorocarbons,
particularly in aerosol cans,

00:45:44.060 --> 00:45:47.520
are really good because
they're not flammable.

00:45:47.520 --> 00:45:52.680
And the alternatives
are, generally speaking,

00:45:52.680 --> 00:45:54.280
pretty flammable.

00:45:54.280 --> 00:45:57.280
And that argument
eventually was won over

00:45:57.280 --> 00:46:00.300
in the survival of the
species side of the camp.

00:46:00.300 --> 00:46:02.609
And so now we have
aerosol cans that

00:46:02.609 --> 00:46:04.150
are much more exciting
than they used

00:46:04.150 --> 00:46:10.180
to be because their propellants
are now more flammable.

00:46:10.180 --> 00:46:14.190
And so I brought you
three examples of that.

00:46:14.190 --> 00:46:15.736
Two hair sprays--
and this, I don't

00:46:15.736 --> 00:46:18.360
get to do this demo when there's
children present, because even

00:46:18.360 --> 00:46:20.170
I draw the line at
teaching kids how

00:46:20.170 --> 00:46:23.996
to make flame throwers with
their mom's hair spray.

00:46:23.996 --> 00:46:25.410
AUDIENCE: What is
the propellant?

00:46:25.410 --> 00:46:27.160
THEODORE GRAY: Well,
it depends, so that's

00:46:27.160 --> 00:46:28.705
why I get different brands.

00:46:28.705 --> 00:46:32.790
We can see what
it is in this one.

00:46:32.790 --> 00:46:37.800
Let's see, this is SD alcohol,
which is not a propellant,

00:46:37.800 --> 00:46:41.000
and hydrofluorocarbon 152a.

00:46:41.000 --> 00:46:44.430
Usually there's a-- where is it?

00:46:44.430 --> 00:46:49.110
No, so that one is-- usually
there's an ether in there.

00:46:49.110 --> 00:46:51.110
I didn't actually read
these ingredients before.

00:46:56.310 --> 00:47:01.280
Aminomethyl propanol
could be the propellant.

00:47:01.280 --> 00:47:02.890
Where is it?

00:47:02.890 --> 00:47:07.291
Anyway, yeah, usually
there's like a methyl ethyl--

00:47:07.291 --> 00:47:08.461
is it methyl ethyl ketone?

00:47:08.461 --> 00:47:08.960
What is it?

00:47:08.960 --> 00:47:09.569
I forget.

00:47:09.569 --> 00:47:10.110
I don't know.

00:47:10.110 --> 00:47:11.120
There's various things.

00:47:11.120 --> 00:47:14.290
It's like they try to make it
as non-flammable as they can,

00:47:14.290 --> 00:47:16.060
but without the
chlorofluorocarbon,

00:47:16.060 --> 00:47:18.380
you're kind of limited.

00:47:18.380 --> 00:47:19.835
So we were going
to aim that away.

00:47:22.445 --> 00:47:25.900
So this one's actually
fairly tame, I think.

00:47:25.900 --> 00:47:27.310
I forget which one it is.

00:47:30.807 --> 00:47:32.640
So if you've ever seen
the James Bond movie,

00:47:32.640 --> 00:47:33.845
it actually does work.

00:47:36.840 --> 00:47:40.390
And then this one is a
slightly different combination.

00:47:46.110 --> 00:47:49.930
You can tell how volatile
some of the components

00:47:49.930 --> 00:47:53.640
are by how far back the flame
reaches towards the can.

00:47:53.640 --> 00:47:56.820
You want to go with brands where
it doesn't reach the nozzle.

00:47:56.820 --> 00:47:59.200
[LAUGHTER]

00:48:00.152 --> 00:48:01.810
OK, so--

00:48:01.810 --> 00:48:03.954
[LAUGHTER]

00:48:04.820 --> 00:48:06.570
Actually, the valves
in these aerosol cans

00:48:06.570 --> 00:48:09.530
are deep inside the metal,
and so there's not actually

00:48:09.530 --> 00:48:11.980
that much opportunity for
the entire can to explode.

00:48:11.980 --> 00:48:15.560
So it turns out that if you want
this actually to work really

00:48:15.560 --> 00:48:18.430
well, you need to pick something
which not only has a flammable

00:48:18.430 --> 00:48:21.980
propellant, but was actually
intended to be flammable,

00:48:21.980 --> 00:48:23.393
namely starter fluid.

00:48:23.393 --> 00:48:25.560
[LAUGHTER]

00:48:25.560 --> 00:48:26.695
This works really well.

00:48:29.847 --> 00:48:30.430
AUDIENCE: Ooh!

00:48:30.430 --> 00:48:32.346
Woohoo!

00:48:32.346 --> 00:48:33.720
THEODORE GRAY: So
I guess you got

00:48:33.720 --> 00:48:35.270
a router up there or something.

00:48:35.270 --> 00:48:36.190
[LAUGHTER]

00:48:36.190 --> 00:48:38.900
And we want to stay away
from the sprinkler system.

00:48:43.095 --> 00:48:48.450
It's highly recommended
as a home demonstration

00:48:48.450 --> 00:48:49.550
of something.

00:48:49.550 --> 00:48:51.940
[LAUGHTER]

00:48:53.380 --> 00:48:54.780
Yeah, so now we
find out how good

00:48:54.780 --> 00:48:56.944
the fire detection
system in here is.

00:48:56.944 --> 00:48:58.610
I don't know if you
could feel the heat,

00:48:58.610 --> 00:49:00.068
but it's actually
surprisingly hot.

00:49:00.068 --> 00:49:01.842
AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:49:01.842 --> 00:49:03.550
THEODORE GRAY: So OK,
well, there you go.

00:49:03.550 --> 00:49:04.140
Thank you very much.

00:49:04.140 --> 00:49:05.186
That's my demonstration.

00:49:05.186 --> 00:49:08.042
[APPLAUSE]

00:49:11.860 --> 00:49:14.910
AUDIENCE: So I work on Chrome,
and I'm a little bit biased

00:49:14.910 --> 00:49:18.964
on people building native
apps versus for iOS or Android

00:49:18.964 --> 00:49:20.130
or something versus the web.

00:49:20.130 --> 00:49:22.596
And obviously, you got
started a few years ago

00:49:22.596 --> 00:49:24.970
when the web couldn't do as
many things as it can do now.

00:49:24.970 --> 00:49:27.240
I was wondering if
you could talk nerdily

00:49:27.240 --> 00:49:29.454
a little bit about why
you just have an iOS

00:49:29.454 --> 00:49:31.620
app versus an Android app,
and whether or not you've

00:49:31.620 --> 00:49:33.995
looked at being able to do
some of this stuff on the web,

00:49:33.995 --> 00:49:35.570
because your apps are amazing.

00:49:35.570 --> 00:49:37.153
THEODORE GRAY: That's
a good question.

00:49:37.153 --> 00:49:41.590
And I mean, so the "Elements"
app and the "Molecules" app,

00:49:41.590 --> 00:49:44.270
with the exception of the
molecular dynamic simulation,

00:49:44.270 --> 00:49:48.690
is-- you could do that
as an HTML5 thing.

00:49:48.690 --> 00:49:51.915
I mean, being able to spin--
I think five years ago when

00:49:51.915 --> 00:49:54.700
we did it, it was
probably not really going

00:49:54.700 --> 00:49:56.202
to be super smooth
as a web thing.

00:49:56.202 --> 00:49:57.910
It probably could be
done as a web thing.

00:49:57.910 --> 00:50:03.600
But many of the apps that
we do have a lot more stuff

00:50:03.600 --> 00:50:06.467
that you can't really do as
a web app sort of a thing.

00:50:06.467 --> 00:50:08.175
I don't know how you
exactly describe it,

00:50:08.175 --> 00:50:11.500
but you need your fingers on
the hardware a little more.

00:50:11.500 --> 00:50:12.450
You need performance.

00:50:12.450 --> 00:50:16.300
You need access to
bits of the hardware

00:50:16.300 --> 00:50:19.360
that you can't necessarily get
to through a web interface.

00:50:19.360 --> 00:50:24.420
And we're in the business
of publishing apps

00:50:24.420 --> 00:50:26.430
to make money on the
sales of the apps, which

00:50:26.430 --> 00:50:27.940
is a really tough
business to be in.

00:50:27.940 --> 00:50:32.480
I think it's gotten worse
and worse over time.

00:50:32.480 --> 00:50:36.250
So the "Elements" app
just-- we've sold,

00:50:36.250 --> 00:50:41.040
I think, 360,000 copies,
something like that, at $14

00:50:41.040 --> 00:50:42.010
a copy.

00:50:42.010 --> 00:50:44.990
And that's very
unusual for apps.

00:50:44.990 --> 00:50:47.760
It's like apps don't cost $14.

00:50:47.760 --> 00:50:51.610
And if they do, they don't
sell in those sort of numbers.

00:50:51.610 --> 00:50:56.535
And that's our
best-selling app to date.

00:50:56.535 --> 00:50:57.410
That's our first app.

00:50:57.410 --> 00:50:59.160
It's the one that got
the company started.

00:50:59.160 --> 00:51:01.360
We've had a few other apps
that have been successful

00:51:01.360 --> 00:51:03.030
at those price points.

00:51:03.030 --> 00:51:07.280
"Disney Animated" has done
reasonably well at $10 a copy.

00:51:07.280 --> 00:51:10.590
We make these super
premium, lush--

00:51:10.590 --> 00:51:13.600
they're like the app equivalent
of a coffee table book.

00:51:13.600 --> 00:51:16.040
And it's very
difficult to get people

00:51:16.040 --> 00:51:21.000
to consider the concept of
paying actual money, let alone

00:51:21.000 --> 00:51:23.600
like $10, for an app--
the exact same people

00:51:23.600 --> 00:51:26.170
who would not bat an
eye at paying $20 or $30

00:51:26.170 --> 00:51:33.110
for a print book or even $10 for
an ebook, just a regular ebook

00:51:33.110 --> 00:51:35.390
on their Kindle, with no
pictures or anything, just

00:51:35.390 --> 00:51:36.620
plain text.

00:51:36.620 --> 00:51:39.950
People are more willing to
spend $10 on a plain text ebook,

00:51:39.950 --> 00:51:43.477
than they are on the
same text in an app.

00:51:43.477 --> 00:51:45.560
There was a great example
that some book-- not one

00:51:45.560 --> 00:51:48.360
of ours-- but a book that
came out simultaneously

00:51:48.360 --> 00:51:55.620
in print, as a static ebook, as
an audio book, and as an app.

00:51:55.620 --> 00:51:58.170
The app, of course,
included everything

00:51:58.170 --> 00:51:59.650
that all the other
versions had--

00:51:59.650 --> 00:52:02.850
the full text and the
recording and plus lots

00:52:02.850 --> 00:52:04.050
of other interactivity.

00:52:04.050 --> 00:52:06.390
And, of course, the app
was by far the cheapest.

00:52:06.390 --> 00:52:09.370
The audio book was
the most expensive,

00:52:09.370 --> 00:52:10.810
and the ebook was in between.

00:52:13.330 --> 00:52:15.100
And that makes no sense.

00:52:15.100 --> 00:52:21.990
It's entirely the psychological
environment of the app store.

00:52:21.990 --> 00:52:24.290
And that's unfortunately a
place where the Android app

00:52:24.290 --> 00:52:28.080
store is even worse
than the iOS app store.

00:52:28.080 --> 00:52:32.540
The iOS app store started out,
and particularly for iPad apps,

00:52:32.540 --> 00:52:34.060
supporting a
reasonably high price

00:52:34.060 --> 00:52:37.510
point for people who wanted to
make money by actually selling

00:52:37.510 --> 00:52:39.566
the apps, as opposed
to many people

00:52:39.566 --> 00:52:40.940
who make apps who
have completely

00:52:40.940 --> 00:52:43.290
different ways of making
money or who are just

00:52:43.290 --> 00:52:48.765
going for the viral hit and can
make by with a few cents a user

00:52:48.765 --> 00:52:51.310
or something.

00:52:51.310 --> 00:52:53.880
And every time we try to think
about doing this for Android--

00:52:53.880 --> 00:52:56.340
and it's not that we have
anything against Android.

00:52:56.340 --> 00:52:58.870
It's just we have
X amount of money

00:52:58.870 --> 00:53:01.280
to put into developing
our next app.

00:53:01.280 --> 00:53:06.126
And if we do this for iOS,
we have some expectation

00:53:06.126 --> 00:53:07.500
of what we're
going to make back.

00:53:07.500 --> 00:53:09.300
We have one platform to target.

00:53:09.300 --> 00:53:11.050
Well, all right, two
or three or whatever.

00:53:11.050 --> 00:53:12.674
But they're all very
nicely integrated.

00:53:12.674 --> 00:53:13.659
They all-- it works.

00:53:13.659 --> 00:53:15.450
We look at Android,
it's like first of all,

00:53:15.450 --> 00:53:16.730
forget all the
phones, because people

00:53:16.730 --> 00:53:17.771
don't use this on phones.

00:53:17.771 --> 00:53:20.860
So you're talking
about tablets only.

00:53:20.860 --> 00:53:22.780
It's fragmentation.

00:53:22.780 --> 00:53:23.920
It's maintenance.

00:53:23.920 --> 00:53:25.720
The development costs
are much higher.

00:53:25.720 --> 00:53:30.367
And the store is not one that is
conducive to high-priced apps.

00:53:30.367 --> 00:53:32.200
And so we always just
say no, you know what?

00:53:32.200 --> 00:53:33.885
Let's make another iOS app.

00:53:33.885 --> 00:53:36.420
And I wish it weren't so.

00:53:36.420 --> 00:53:40.460
And I wish we could do something
that would be cross-platform

00:53:40.460 --> 00:53:43.380
as a web thing, but
when you're doing

00:53:43.380 --> 00:53:46.870
synchronized audio,
complex interactivity

00:53:46.870 --> 00:53:49.560
with multiple streams
of audio and things

00:53:49.560 --> 00:53:52.780
and video-- our
apps are very big.

00:53:52.780 --> 00:53:56.885
They're like a gigabyte
or more sometimes.

00:53:56.885 --> 00:53:59.260
It's like there's only one
platform where that really

00:53:59.260 --> 00:53:59.790
make sense.

00:53:59.790 --> 00:54:03.280
And that's, unfortunately,
right now iOS.

00:54:03.280 --> 00:54:06.089
And I think it's like the
days are numbered where we're

00:54:06.089 --> 00:54:08.130
going to keep doing this,
because the returns are

00:54:08.130 --> 00:54:11.200
actually not improving,
despite the number of devices,

00:54:11.200 --> 00:54:15.470
because the app store
environment is deteriorating.

00:54:15.470 --> 00:54:17.660
AUDIENCE: What inspired
you to get into chemistry

00:54:17.660 --> 00:54:18.887
and stay in chemistry?

00:54:18.887 --> 00:54:21.470
THEODORE GRAY: Well, actually I
was never really in chemistry.

00:54:21.470 --> 00:54:24.270
So I have a bachelor's
degree in chemistry,

00:54:24.270 --> 00:54:27.330
and then I dropped out
of graduate school to go

00:54:27.330 --> 00:54:31.230
and co-found Wolfram Research
with Stephen Wolfram, which

00:54:31.230 --> 00:54:35.150
is the makers of Mathematica,
and ultimately, WolframAlpha.

00:54:35.150 --> 00:54:37.380
And so I spent the
last-- I mean, that

00:54:37.380 --> 00:54:41.050
was 1987-- and up until
a couple of years ago,

00:54:41.050 --> 00:54:43.130
that was kind of my job.

00:54:43.130 --> 00:54:47.640
And this whole periodic
table book-writing stuff

00:54:47.640 --> 00:54:49.940
was just a hobby.

00:54:49.940 --> 00:54:51.440
Since then, I've
now transitioned

00:54:51.440 --> 00:54:53.710
into Touch Press,
our map company,

00:54:53.710 --> 00:54:55.900
being my primary occupation.

00:54:55.900 --> 00:55:00.720
And since then, decided, OK, no,
I'm just going to be a writer

00:55:00.720 --> 00:55:02.620
and do this, because
this is much more

00:55:02.620 --> 00:55:07.730
interesting than working
on other people's projects.

00:55:07.730 --> 00:55:10.410
But as far as why
chemistry, I don't know.

00:55:10.410 --> 00:55:12.120
I like the names.

00:55:12.120 --> 00:55:15.200
I think organic chemical
naming systems are fascinating.

00:55:15.200 --> 00:55:19.485
That was my original reason for
studying organic chemistry--

00:55:19.485 --> 00:55:21.770
not a good basis
for a career choice.

00:55:21.770 --> 00:55:24.460
And then the reason I decided
to get out of chemistry

00:55:24.460 --> 00:55:27.336
was because I realized that if
I became a professional chemist,

00:55:27.336 --> 00:55:28.710
particularly an
academic chemist,

00:55:28.710 --> 00:55:30.300
I wouldn't get to
do any chemistry.

00:55:30.300 --> 00:55:32.771
But you know, I like blowing
stuff up and mixing things.

00:55:32.771 --> 00:55:35.270
And you can't do that if you're
a chemist, because you spend

00:55:35.270 --> 00:55:37.200
all your time writing
grant proposals.

00:55:37.200 --> 00:55:42.830
And being a science writer, like
for "Popular Science" column,

00:55:42.830 --> 00:55:46.150
every month, for 10 years,
I got to blow something up.

00:55:46.150 --> 00:55:47.550
They'd send a photographer down.

00:55:47.550 --> 00:55:48.720
I had a big shop.

00:55:48.720 --> 00:55:52.210
And we would do something
involving chemicals--

00:55:52.210 --> 00:55:53.614
build transparent
rocket engines.

00:55:53.614 --> 00:55:55.030
It's all this stuff
that you don't

00:55:55.030 --> 00:55:57.000
get to do if you're
actually a chemist.

00:55:57.000 --> 00:56:01.990
So my interest was primarily
nurtured and expanded

00:56:01.990 --> 00:56:05.520
by not actually being a chemist
in a professional sense,

00:56:05.520 --> 00:56:07.590
but getting to do
all the stuff that

00:56:07.590 --> 00:56:10.470
is the most fun
and the most useful

00:56:10.470 --> 00:56:14.004
in terms of communicating
chemistry to the public.

00:56:14.004 --> 00:56:16.420
I actually got an award from
the American Chemical Society

00:56:16.420 --> 00:56:19.350
called the Grady Stack Award
for Communication of Chemistry

00:56:19.350 --> 00:56:22.560
to the Public, which I
think of as the "We Found

00:56:22.560 --> 00:56:28.787
a Journalist Who Doesn't Hate
Us" award, which is hard.

00:56:28.787 --> 00:56:31.120
It's hard for them, and they
don't have a lot of choice,

00:56:31.120 --> 00:56:33.475
as evidenced by the fact
that they gave it to me.

00:56:33.475 --> 00:56:35.350
AUDIENCE: With all the
content that you have,

00:56:35.350 --> 00:56:37.330
have you ever considered
creating a MOOC

00:56:37.330 --> 00:56:40.080
to open chemistry to the masses?

00:56:40.080 --> 00:56:41.580
THEODORE GRAY: Funny
you should ask.

00:56:41.580 --> 00:56:42.510
Yes, I have thought about it.

00:56:42.510 --> 00:56:44.009
And I've also thought
about how much

00:56:44.009 --> 00:56:47.920
I enjoy not being a creator
of stuff that actually

00:56:47.920 --> 00:56:50.330
gets officially used in schools.

00:56:50.330 --> 00:56:50.830
Right?

00:56:50.830 --> 00:56:55.540
Because as soon as you do that,
there are so many restrictions,

00:56:55.540 --> 00:56:57.330
and there's so
much you can't do.

00:56:57.330 --> 00:56:59.560
Like my books will
find themselves

00:56:59.560 --> 00:57:02.225
in the library of
a grade school,

00:57:02.225 --> 00:57:03.835
if no parent has noticed.

00:57:06.692 --> 00:57:09.490
And it's like the more
enlightened parents get it

00:57:09.490 --> 00:57:13.245
for their kids, but it would
never, ever pass as a textbook.

00:57:13.245 --> 00:57:15.620
And I wouldn't want to have
to take everything out of it.

00:57:15.620 --> 00:57:17.536
Actually, in the case
of the "Molecules" book,

00:57:17.536 --> 00:57:22.020
I admit, OK, we sold so
many copies of "Elements"

00:57:22.020 --> 00:57:24.390
to the Scholastic book
fairs, where they go around

00:57:24.390 --> 00:57:27.065
to schools, and they have
these displays-- lots

00:57:27.065 --> 00:57:28.800
of copies every year.

00:57:28.800 --> 00:57:30.824
And so my publisher
was very eager

00:57:30.824 --> 00:57:32.990
that they should do the
same thing with "Molecules."

00:57:32.990 --> 00:57:34.950
And so they ran it by them.

00:57:34.950 --> 00:57:36.880
And there was this
woman who reminds

00:57:36.880 --> 00:57:42.090
me Dolores Umbridge from the
"Harry Potter" series, who

00:57:42.090 --> 00:57:44.540
went through it line by line.

00:57:44.540 --> 00:57:47.520
And we cut out-- you
know, there was some stuff

00:57:47.520 --> 00:57:49.770
that even I have to admit
after the fact was perhaps

00:57:49.770 --> 00:57:54.600
a bit off-color and maybe
not really belonging there.

00:57:54.600 --> 00:57:57.660
There was a marijuana
bud that was full-page.

00:57:57.660 --> 00:57:59.130
It was gorgeous.

00:57:59.130 --> 00:58:01.889
I mean it was just
unbelievably beautiful.

00:58:01.889 --> 00:58:03.680
And you can talk about
the fact that that's

00:58:03.680 --> 00:58:06.190
a pesticide to the plant.

00:58:06.190 --> 00:58:10.909
The THC is a pesticide
that the plant makes.

00:58:10.909 --> 00:58:12.450
But we took it out,
because it's just

00:58:12.450 --> 00:58:14.250
like, you don't
really need that.

00:58:14.250 --> 00:58:16.580
And we made the
heroin rock smaller.

00:58:16.580 --> 00:58:17.670
And it was gorgeous, too.

00:58:17.670 --> 00:58:19.420
It's a beautiful,
beautiful rock of heroin

00:58:19.420 --> 00:58:21.711
that I had to flush down the
toilet, because you really

00:58:21.711 --> 00:58:23.338
can't hang on to
that kind of thing.

00:58:23.338 --> 00:58:25.630
[LAUGHTER]

00:58:29.544 --> 00:58:30.710
Where was I going with this?

00:58:30.710 --> 00:58:31.251
I don't know.

00:58:31.251 --> 00:58:33.360
Yeah, so right, actually
being a textbook author

00:58:33.360 --> 00:58:35.120
isn't very appealing
because you don't

00:58:35.120 --> 00:58:36.390
get to do that kind of stuff.

00:58:36.390 --> 00:58:42.192
However, there's value in it
and watch this space perhaps.

00:58:42.192 --> 00:58:42.900
MALE SPEAKER: OK.

00:58:42.900 --> 00:58:45.358
Let's all thank Theo for coming
here and giving a super fun

00:58:45.358 --> 00:58:45.930
talk.

00:58:45.930 --> 00:58:48.980
[APPLAUSE]
