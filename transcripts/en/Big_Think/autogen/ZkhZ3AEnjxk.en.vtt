boils down to two huge forces that are

00:00:10.850 --> 00:00:10.860
boils down to two huge forces that are
 

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:13.220
boils down to two huge forces that are
dramatically changing the world and will

00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:13.230
dramatically changing the world and will
 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:15.410
dramatically changing the world and will
do so even more over the next 20 30

00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:15.420
do so even more over the next 20 30
 

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:19.370
do so even more over the next 20 30
years one force is the is a dark force

00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:19.380
years one force is the is a dark force
 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:22.820
years one force is the is a dark force
it's the population increase where we

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:22.830
it's the population increase where we
 

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:24.590
it's the population increase where we
had three billion people in nineteen

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:24.600
had three billion people in nineteen
 

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:27.800
had three billion people in nineteen
sixty five billion people in 1990 now we

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:27.810
sixty five billion people in 1990 now we
 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:30.740
sixty five billion people in 1990 now we
had six billion or a little more and we

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:30.750
had six billion or a little more and we
 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:34.430
had six billion or a little more and we
headed straight to 9 billion by 2050 so

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:34.440
headed straight to 9 billion by 2050 so
 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:37.459
headed straight to 9 billion by 2050 so
between 1960 in 2050 we will have

00:00:37.459 --> 00:00:37.469
between 1960 in 2050 we will have
 

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:40.400
between 1960 in 2050 we will have
tripled the world population on a planet

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:40.410
tripled the world population on a planet
 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:42.229
tripled the world population on a planet
that's already extremely stressed in

00:00:42.229 --> 00:00:42.239
that's already extremely stressed in
 

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:45.049
that's already extremely stressed in
terms of the environment arable land and

00:00:45.049 --> 00:00:45.059
terms of the environment arable land and
 

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:48.049
terms of the environment arable land and
even social stressors so that's one huge

00:00:48.049 --> 00:00:48.059
even social stressors so that's one huge
 

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:51.350
even social stressors so that's one huge
force that there is a massive force of

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:51.360
force that there is a massive force of
 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:55.369
force that there is a massive force of
change and and that clearly plays a role

00:00:55.369 --> 00:00:55.379
change and and that clearly plays a role
 

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:58.160
change and and that clearly plays a role
in my world view the other force is this

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:58.170
in my world view the other force is this
 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:00.760
in my world view the other force is this
new world economy that is based on very

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:00.770
new world economy that is based on very
 

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:03.020
new world economy that is based on very
inexpensive telecommunications and

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:03.030
inexpensive telecommunications and
 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:05.570
inexpensive telecommunications and
computer technologies which is a real

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:05.580
computer technologies which is a real
 

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:08.480
computer technologies which is a real
industrial revolution but unlike the

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.490
industrial revolution but unlike the
 

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:10.310
industrial revolution but unlike the
earlier and dust revolutions that had to

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:10.320
earlier and dust revolutions that had to
 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:12.109

because it transforms time and distance

00:01:16.969 --> 00:01:16.979
because it transforms time and distance
 

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:19.789
because it transforms time and distance
and it makes knowledge the biggest

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:19.799

factor of production and that new
 

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:24.950

wonderful new things but it's also a
 

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:43.310

very tough new economy where you have to

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:43.320
very tough new economy where you have to
 

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:44.899
very tough new economy where you have to
be agile you have to be good at

constantly inventing new tricks and you

00:01:49.249 --> 00:01:49.259
constantly inventing new tricks and you
 

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:51.980
constantly inventing new tricks and you
have to be very reliable and so some

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:51.990
have to be very reliable and so some
 

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:54.139

countries and companies and individuals

00:01:54.139 --> 00:01:54.149
countries and companies and individuals
 

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:56.300
countries and companies and individuals
do very well in that new economy some

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:56.310
do very well in that new economy some
 

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:59.810

fall by the wayside so it's a very most

00:01:59.810 --> 00:01:59.820
fall by the wayside so it's a very most
 

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:01.700
fall by the wayside so it's a very most
positive and negative force but it's a

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:01.710
positive and negative force but it's a
 

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:03.889
positive and negative force but it's a
huge force and we've probably only seen

00:02:03.889 --> 00:02:03.899
huge force and we've probably only seen
 

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:06.109
huge force and we've probably only seen
twenty percent of it this industrial

00:02:06.109 --> 00:02:06.119
twenty percent of it this industrial
 

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:08.630
twenty percent of it this industrial
revolution based on telecoms and

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:08.640
revolution based on telecoms and
 

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:10.550
revolution based on telecoms and
computer technology still has eighty

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:10.560
computer technology still has eighty
 

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:13.740
computer technology still has eighty
percent to go and these two big forces

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:13.750
percent to go and these two big forces
 

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:17.160
percent to go and these two big forces
I think overwhelmed the capacity of the

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:17.170
I think overwhelmed the capacity of the
 

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:19.260
I think overwhelmed the capacity of the
human institutions we have to manage

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:19.270
human institutions we have to manage
 

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:22.170
human institutions we have to manage
them the human institutions being

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:22.180
them the human institutions being
 

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:24.660
them the human institutions being
nation-states the government's the

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:24.670
nation-states the government's the
 

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:28.080
nation-states the government's the
ministries the public agencies of

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:28.090
ministries the public agencies of
 

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:29.580

various kinds the international

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:29.590
various kinds the international
 

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:32.940

organizations all that human system of

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:32.950
organizations all that human system of
 

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:35.250
organizations all that human system of
management is overwhelmed by these two

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:35.260
management is overwhelmed by these two
 

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:38.699
management is overwhelmed by these two
big forces and so I think we are seeing

00:02:38.699 --> 00:02:38.709
big forces and so I think we are seeing
 

00:02:38.709 --> 00:02:42.480
big forces and so I think we are seeing
the beginning of a governance gap sort

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:42.490
the beginning of a governance gap sort
 

00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:44.640
the beginning of a governance gap sort
of inability to manage the forces which

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:44.650
of inability to manage the forces which
 

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:47.850
of inability to manage the forces which
we ourselves have unleashed
