00:00:00.403 --> 00:00:01.808
Male voiceover: Let's
see if we can understand

00:00:01.808 --> 00:00:04.078
a thing or two about Futures Curves

00:00:04.078 --> 00:00:06.162
and I've drawn two futures curves here

00:00:06.162 --> 00:00:11.386
and really all they show is
the different settlement prices

00:00:11.386 --> 00:00:14.752
for the different
delivery dates of futures.

00:00:14.752 --> 00:00:17.080
So, let's say that this
orange curve is one of them.

00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:21.583
What this says is if today,
if for delivery today,

00:00:21.583 --> 00:00:24.074
we wanted to buy or sell an apple,

00:00:24.074 --> 00:00:25.996
the market rate is 10 cents a pound.

00:00:25.996 --> 00:00:27.781
This isn't the Futures contract at all.

00:00:27.781 --> 00:00:29.786
This is actually called the Spot Price.

00:00:29.786 --> 00:00:33.210
It's essentially the market
price for that commodity

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:34.494
or that security today.

00:00:34.494 --> 00:00:36.149
We're just using the example of apples.

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:39.489
This tells us at time 0, you
can buy or sell an apple,

00:00:39.489 --> 00:00:41.449
based on the current market for 10 cents.

00:00:41.449 --> 00:00:44.736
Now, when we move to 1, the
way I've labeled this axis,

00:00:44.736 --> 00:00:47.258
it says one month from now.

00:00:47.258 --> 00:00:49.919
This is not saying that
the market price is going

00:00:49.919 --> 00:00:51.385
to go up one month from now.

00:00:51.385 --> 00:00:53.270
This is saying that today,

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:55.586
if you were to go into the Futures market

00:00:55.586 --> 00:00:59.427
and say, "I want to sell,"
or, "I want to buy apples

00:00:59.427 --> 00:01:00.920
"one month from now.

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:02.851
"What type of a settlement price

00:01:02.851 --> 00:01:04.534
"can I get on my Futures contract?"

00:01:04.534 --> 00:01:06.745
And based on this Futures Curve,

00:01:06.745 --> 00:01:09.492
it looks like we could do about 12 cents.

00:01:09.492 --> 00:01:12.572
I'm gonna repeat what I just said.

00:01:12.572 --> 00:01:16.145
This is not saying that a month from now

00:01:16.145 --> 00:01:17.600
that the market price

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:19.331
that the Spot Price is going to move up.

00:01:19.331 --> 00:01:21.343
Only this time 0 is the Spot Price.

00:01:21.343 --> 00:01:23.835
What this is saying is right now,

00:01:23.835 --> 00:01:25.313
the market is saying,
"If you want to enter

00:01:25.313 --> 00:01:28.236
"into a Futures contract for
delivery a month from now,

00:01:28.236 --> 00:01:32.135
"that delivery price will be 12 cents.

00:01:32.135 --> 00:01:34.391
"If you wanna deliver two months from now,

00:01:34.391 --> 00:01:36.693
that delivery price
might be around 15 cents.

00:01:36.693 --> 00:01:39.103
"If you wanna deliver
eight months from now,

00:01:39.103 --> 00:01:42.324
"that delivery price might
be something like 20 cents."

00:01:42.324 --> 00:01:43.789
If you wanted to show movement,

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:45.499
let's say all of a sudden,

00:01:45.499 --> 00:01:47.209
people just get more bullish on apples

00:01:47.209 --> 00:01:49.426
or there's some new
diet that tells everyone

00:01:49.426 --> 00:01:51.239
that apples help you lose weight,

00:01:51.239 --> 00:01:53.443
what you would probably see is

00:01:53.443 --> 00:01:55.907
this entire curve would shift up

00:01:55.923 --> 00:01:58.175
So, regardless of delivery date,

00:01:58.175 --> 00:02:01.250
you would probably see
this entire curve shift up

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:02.988
because people would want apples

00:02:02.988 --> 00:02:06.584
across the entire Futures Curve.

00:02:06.584 --> 00:02:08.521
This one that we're
highlighting right now,

00:02:08.521 --> 00:02:09.987
I've drawn two Futures Curves.

00:02:09.987 --> 00:02:12.523
I've drawn an upwards sloping orange one

00:02:12.523 --> 00:02:14.987
and I've also drawn a
downward sloping blue one

00:02:14.987 --> 00:02:16.671
and I'll focus on that
one in the next video

00:02:16.671 --> 00:02:20.395
but this upward sloping
is kind of a normal curve

00:02:20.395 --> 00:02:21.651
and it's actually called that.

00:02:21.651 --> 00:02:24.659
It's a Normal Curve because
this is what you actually expect

00:02:24.659 --> 00:02:27.051
for most types of commodities.

00:02:27.051 --> 00:02:27.999
You could imagine why.

00:02:27.999 --> 00:02:32.076
If this wasn't upward sloping,

00:02:32.076 --> 00:02:33.722
there would actually be no reason for you

00:02:33.722 --> 00:02:34.632
to hold onto something.

00:02:34.632 --> 00:02:35.910
Especially, if this was downwards sloping,

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:37.269
you'd be like, "Wow.

00:02:37.269 --> 00:02:38.459
"If for future delivery dates,

00:02:38.459 --> 00:02:39.746
"I'm getting lower and lower prices,

00:02:39.746 --> 00:02:41.602
"why don't I just sell now?"

00:02:41.618 --> 00:02:43.899
And that would actually
create downward pressure

00:02:43.899 --> 00:02:45.400
on the current Spot Price

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:48.144
and you could of course, make
the arbitrage arguments I made

00:02:48.144 --> 00:02:51.761
in previous videos, why you
shouldn't in a theoretical setting,

00:02:51.761 --> 00:02:54.666
see a downward sloping Futures Curve.

00:02:54.666 --> 00:02:57.410
What we're gonna talk a little
bit about on the next video,

00:02:57.410 --> 00:03:01.151
is maybe why you would see a
downward sloping Futures Curve

00:03:01.151 --> 00:03:05.164
where the delivery price
for delivery further out

00:03:05.164 --> 00:03:07.237
than the Spot Price or
for further out months

00:03:07.237 --> 00:03:09.769
than nearby months is actually lower

00:03:09.769 --> 00:03:11.376
and just to give you a little terminology,

00:03:11.376 --> 00:03:14.789
this type of curve right here
is called an Inverted Curve

00:03:14.789 --> 00:03:16.252
and I'll talk in the next video on

00:03:16.252 --> 23:59:59.999
why you might see one of those.
