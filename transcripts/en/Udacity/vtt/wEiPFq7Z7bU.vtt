00:00:00.610 --> 00:00:03.780
Another way that we can look at
risk in this thought experiment

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:08.440
is to consider the standard deviation
of all those individual bets.

00:00:08.440 --> 00:00:12.980
So again consider we have a thousand
different betting tables out there, and

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:15.630
we have the opportunity to
allocate our bets however we like.

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:20.222
We could put 200 tokens on one table,
5 on another, and so on.

00:00:20.222 --> 00:00:24.537
We're looking at the two extreme cases
here of course, but in any case,

00:00:24.537 --> 00:00:29.180
what is the standard deviation of the
results of all those individual bet?.

00:00:29.180 --> 00:00:31.870
So we're going to look at standard
deviation after the fact,

00:00:31.870 --> 00:00:34.530
in other words,
we're going to assume we bet already and

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:36.330
we're looking at the outcome.

00:00:36.330 --> 00:00:41.590
So if we have one token per table we
might have a loss of one token on

00:00:41.590 --> 00:00:46.640
one table, a gain on another,
another loss, and a gain, and

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:51.615
a gain and so on,
all the way across our 1,000 tables.

00:00:51.615 --> 00:00:54.740
Now, we don't actually have to spend
much time doing the math here.

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:57.410
It turns out that
the standard deviation for

00:00:57.410 --> 00:01:00.010
this case is pretty easy to calculate.

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:03.112
Because for each table,
the result is either -1 or 1.

00:01:03.112 --> 00:01:06.510
And it turns out that the standard
deviation in this case

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:08.190
is easily calculated as 1.0.

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:13.020
So it doesn't matter what
the particular outcome turns out to be.

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:16.350
We know we're either going to lose 1 or
gain 1 at every single table.

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:19.730
And so our expected standard
deviation there is 1.

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:20.930
The outcome for

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:25.210
the second scenario where we make
one bet with a 1000 tokens and then

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:29.770
essentially 0 bets on the other tables,
turns out a little bit differently.

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:33.390
So on this first table
where we bet 1000 tokens,

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:38.100
we either win 1000 or we lose 1000.

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:43.000
And on all the other tables,
the outcome is exactly 0.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.190
Same for this case where
we lost on that first one.

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:50.190
So again,
we bet on one table 1,000 tokens, and

00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:52.770
we bet 0 tokens on the other 999.

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:57.160
Reasoning it out this way enables us
to calculate the standard deviation.

00:01:57.160 --> 00:02:00.000
Whichever way it goes whether we win or
lose,

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:04.910
the standard deviation on
this event is the same.

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:06.650
And the answer is 31.62.

00:02:06.650 --> 00:02:12.540
Key point here is, the standard
deviation or risk is much, much larger.

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:15.210
Well as you can see
about 31 time larger,

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:19.190
when we make that single bet on one
table and no bets on the other tables.
