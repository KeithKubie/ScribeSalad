00:00:00.840 --> 00:00:05.390
Over the past centuries, technologies have
regularly come along that completely change

00:00:05.390 --> 00:00:10.090
how we connect to each other: the printing
press, the telegraph, the telephone; the newspaper,

00:00:10.090 --> 00:00:11.290
the radio, the TV.

00:00:11.290 --> 00:00:15.360
All are technologies that begin social
revolutions.

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:20.920
We’re living through one such revolution
now. It started in 1962 with a humble, almost

00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:27.109
boring idea: connecting computers together.
Today, almost three billion people are connected.

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:30.270
What kind of revolution are we going through?

00:00:30.270 --> 00:00:35.320
- Firstly, it’s fast. It took 25 years after
the Guttenberg Press arrived for the first

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:39.399
English book to be printed.
In its first twenty-five years, the telephone

00:00:39.399 --> 00:00:42.090
reached just 10% of America.

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:47.910
In 1995, less than 1% of the world’s population
was connected. The first billion was reached

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:53.660
in 2005. The second billion in 2010. The third
billion at the end of 2014.

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:58.750
The benefits of the Internet are obvious
and all around us. In a European-wide poll,

00:00:58.750 --> 00:01:02.610
people put the Internet at the top of their
list of daily essentials – ahead of the

00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:04.369
bath,the car and the television.

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:08.309
But the risks and dangers are less obvious
and more subterranean.

00:01:08.309 --> 00:01:10.679
There are at least four.

00:01:10.679 --> 00:01:12.130
ONE - WE’RE ADDICTED

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:16.899
In the UK, two in five of us recognise we’re
spending too long on the internet but admit

00:01:16.899 --> 00:01:17.779
we can’t stop.

00:01:17.779 --> 00:01:21.590
Three in five of us check the internet the
first thing in the morning, and the last thing

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:25.420
at night - and put this habit ahead of interpersonal
communication.

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:30.329
Two in five women say that one of the greatest
challenges of relationships has become how

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:33.649
to prove more interesting than the partner’s
smartphone.

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:38.119
Nine out of ten people would rather be surfing
the web rather than reading a book.

00:01:38.119 --> 00:01:43.179
Internet pornography has proved particularly
compelling: 60% of US adult males admit to

00:01:43.179 --> 00:01:48.569
using it at least once a month. 9% of males
classify themselves as spending between 10

00:01:48.569 --> 00:01:50.669
and 20 hours a week on porn.

00:01:50.669 --> 00:01:55.469
We are not neurologically designed to withstand
the temptations on offer online - and this

00:01:55.469 --> 00:01:59.799
suits a great many internet companies just
fine.

00:01:59.799 --> 00:02:03.039
TWO - WE KNOW TOO MUCH AND UNDERSTAND TOO
LITTLE

00:02:03.039 --> 00:02:06.679
The amount of information at our fingertips
is unimaginably large;

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:08.000
every single minute of the day:

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:11.120
Facebook users share 2.5 million pieces
of content.

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:15.900
Twitter users Tweet 300,000 times. YouTube users upload 72 hours of video

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:20.000
200million emails are sent. Apple users download 50,000 apps

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:25.790
Between the dawn of civilization and 2003,
5 exabytes of data was created. That much

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:29.290
information is now created every 2 days.

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:33.760
There is so much data that we keep having
to come up with new words to describe it.

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:35.959
The latest term is the yottabyte.

00:02:35.959 --> 00:02:39.629
This much data is overwhelming and asphyxiating.

00:02:39.629 --> 00:02:44.939
To manoeuvre, we have to rely on search engines.
Google makes 2.5 billion searches per day.

00:02:44.939 --> 00:02:49.269
But we forget that these search engines are
mechanical and highly coloured in their interpretations.

00:02:49.269 --> 00:02:54.349
For a start, they constantly direct our attention
to their products, sponsors, and affiliates.

00:02:54.349 --> 00:02:55.469
Imagine the Dewey Decimal system owned by
Coca Cola.

00:02:55.469 --> 00:03:00.640
A lot of the information is nonsense: during
the riots in London in 2011, the three most

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:05.340
shared stories on Twitter were that the London
Eye was on Fire, the Army was on the streets,

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:07.510
and that a tiger had escaped from London zoo.

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:12.109
Because the internet is often a source of
reliable information, we exaggerate its accuracy,

00:03:12.109 --> 00:03:13.969
its importance and its wisdom.

00:03:13.969 --> 00:03:17.180
The 12th most popular question typed into
Google is:

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:19.170
WHAT SHALL I DO WITH MY LIFE?

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:22.829
It doesn’t know, but at the same time, it
constantly gets in the way of the conversations

00:03:22.829 --> 00:03:28.340
you might have with the one person who does:
namely, you.

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:29.870
THREE - PRIVACY IS UNDER THREAT

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:34.749
Thousands of ‘cookies’ track where
we go. Our mobile phones log data about our

00:03:34.749 --> 00:03:37.920
movements every five seconds, even when they
are ostensibly off.

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:42.340
The head of the French police force proposed
it’s now almost impossible to commit a murder

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:43.389
and remain undetected.

00:03:43.389 --> 00:03:48.370
We’re constantly leaving so-called digital
breadcrumbs on our online travels. Every year,

00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:53.749
in the UK, we leave up to £5,000 worth of
data online which is sold to marketing companies

00:03:53.749 --> 00:03:59.099
and harvested, filtered and cross-referenced
to provide detailed insight into our lives.

00:03:59.099 --> 00:04:01.930
Facebook will know you’re gay before your
mother does.

00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:06.849
70% of us admit to fearing how much we
have already shared. one in seven teenagers

00:04:06.849 --> 00:04:11.379
in the US has sent a compromising image over
the internet and had a sexual chat with a

00:04:11.379 --> 00:04:12.090
real-life stranger.

00:04:12.090 --> 00:04:16.949
A majority of European internet users are
under the impression that a security service

00:04:16.949 --> 00:04:20.030
has snooped into their conversations and activities.

00:04:20.030 --> 00:04:22.470
FOUR - ONLINE CRIME IS OUT OF CONTROL

00:04:22.470 --> 00:04:27.440
Over the last twenty years, crime has abated
in many countries. Since it peaked in the

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:30.349
UK in 1995, it has fallen by 60%.

00:04:30.349 --> 00:04:33.419
But Internet crime is exploding.

00:04:33.419 --> 00:04:39.810
In 1990 the NSPCC estimated there were 7,000
known images of child pornography at large.

00:04:39.810 --> 00:04:46.490
In 2014, American law enforcement found 42
million images on just one server.

00:04:46.490 --> 00:04:51.370
The UK Government estimates 50,000 people
in the UK are actively involved in downloading

00:04:51.370 --> 00:04:53.819
and sharing images of child abuse.

00:04:53.819 --> 00:04:58.139
Online abuse and hate-speech are endemic:On Twitter, 10,000 uses of racist slur

00:04:58.139 --> 00:04:59.160
terms occur a day.

00:04:59.160 --> 00:05:02.250
And 2000 Tweets are sent containing the
word ‘rape’.

00:05:02.250 --> 00:05:06.220
69% of young people in the UK have experienced
cyber-bullying

00:05:06.220 --> 00:05:10.669
The police are overwhelmed. The Head of
the UK’s National Crime Agency recently

00:05:10.669 --> 00:05:17.030
said they would only ever be able to focus
on less than 1% of child porn users.

00:05:17.030 --> 00:05:18.650
CONCLUSION

00:05:18.650 --> 00:05:22.610
One view is that new technologies have always
brought anxieties with them, and that they

00:05:22.610 --> 00:05:24.530
always turn out to be groundless.

00:05:24.530 --> 00:05:29.289
Socrates in Plato’s Phaedrus warned that
books would promote forgetfulness. People

00:05:29.289 --> 00:05:33.240
would become the “hearers of many things
and will have learned nothing”.

00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:37.960
But that’s too rosy and too relaxed about
what we’re facing. Technologies can and

00:05:37.960 --> 00:05:42.690
do bring serious lasting problems. As the
residents of Hiroshima realised.

00:05:42.690 --> 00:05:45.970
The internet presents unrivalled challenges
to our abilities to:

00:05:45.970 --> 00:05:47.250
- interact deeply with our partners

00:05:47.250 --> 00:05:49.110
- keep our critical faculties alive

00:05:49.110 --> 00:05:52.300
- stop thinking that the answers always lie
‘out there’.

00:05:52.300 --> 00:05:55.090
- remain emotionally connected to real-life
people.

00:05:55.090 --> 00:05:59.229
- and make the discoveries that come when
we are bored and letting our minds lie fallow.

00:05:59.229 --> 00:06:01.379
We need to start to take active measures to

00:06:01.379 --> 00:06:03.990
educate our children in the dangers of this
tool

00:06:03.990 --> 00:06:07.620
reconnect with the natural world
talk to one another face to face

00:06:07.620 --> 00:06:11.039
stop downloading images of naked people
get bored

00:06:11.039 --> 00:06:13.370
and take regular digital sabbaths.

00:06:13.370 --> 00:06:17.639
We need to learn to control ourselves not
because the internet is so bad, but precisely

00:06:17.639 --> 00:06:22.240
because it’s so very very nice - in ways
that turn out to be deeply detrimental to

00:06:22.240 --> 00:06:24.610
our ability to flourish and function..

00:06:24.610 --> 00:06:28.620
We can accept that it is not a good thing
to let a fifteen year old boy have unmonitored

00:06:28.620 --> 00:06:32.889
access to the internet in his bedroom. Not
because we think he is wicked. But because

00:06:32.889 --> 00:06:37.560
we are generous. We understand that asking
for self-control in those circumstances is

00:06:37.560 --> 00:06:41.940
too demanding. A similar argument applies
if you happen to be twenty six - or forty

00:06:41.940 --> 00:06:42.629
six.

00:06:42.629 --> 00:06:47.400
The internet has unparalleled power to get
in the way of almost every other rather important

00:06:47.400 --> 00:06:52.120
and precious thing around - starting with
the rest of your life.
