MARTIN AGUINIS: I'm here
with Will Larche, who works

00:00:07.920 --> 00:00:09.714
on Material Design and Flutter.

00:00:09.714 --> 00:00:12.380
Will, could you tell us a little
bit more about what that means?

00:00:12.380 --> 00:00:13.129
WILL LARCHE: Sure.

00:00:13.129 --> 00:00:16.079
So I'm the Flutter
engineering lead in Material.

00:00:16.079 --> 00:00:18.180
Material has a huge
engineering team

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:19.860
that works on
material components

00:00:19.860 --> 00:00:24.300
on different platforms, and also
supports the different platform

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:28.320
teams like Flutter as
they're building out anything

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:29.520
that has to do with design.

00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:32.910
So I work with
material designers,

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:34.380
and I work with
Flutter engineers

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:37.260
to make sure that there
is really good, really

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:40.049
easily executable beautiful
design in Flutter.

00:00:40.049 --> 00:00:41.340
MARTIN AGUINIS: That's amazing.

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:43.620
I remember an I/O
earlier this year,

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:47.130
Flutter was one of the four
first-class implementations

00:00:47.130 --> 00:00:50.604
of material alongside
Android, web, and OS.

00:00:50.604 --> 00:00:52.020
I'm wondering if
you could comment

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:53.125
a little bit about that.

00:00:53.125 --> 00:00:56.520
WILL LARCHE: Yeah, so
that still blows me away.

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:59.410
It's really exciting
to be in that group.

00:00:59.410 --> 00:01:02.100
Those are some giants
of digital industry,

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:05.220
and Flutter is
that important now.

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:08.250
So we support it with
our documentation

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:12.870
by having an engineering team,
and we believe that this time,

00:01:12.870 --> 00:01:14.820
we will be growing with
the platform instead

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:16.020
of having to catch up.

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:17.850
And that is a really
great place to be.

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:20.610
Also we're really
grateful to the Flutter

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:22.740
team for the material
implementation

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:26.220
that they have built. It is
spot on, and it's amazing.

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:29.880
And being the default UI
library for a platform

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:32.070
is really flattering.

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:34.350
We're really, really
grateful that people

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:38.220
understand how material design
makes beautiful things easily.

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:41.545
And now that we see how Flutter
makes any kind of app easily,

00:01:41.545 --> 00:01:43.170
those two things go
together perfectly.

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:44.880
MARTIN AGUINIS: What really
motivates you every day

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:45.671
to work on Flutter?

00:01:45.671 --> 00:01:48.900
WILL LARCHE: I was
assigned to Flutter just

00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:51.300
to do a little bit of an
exploration to Material.

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:53.700
I was working on the
iOS team at the time.

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:56.100
And almost instantly
I knew that I did not

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:58.410
want to do anything
but Flutter ever again

00:01:58.410 --> 00:01:59.610
for the rest of my career.

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:02.010
Every day is a delight
building with Flutter,

00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:04.800
and it's very exciting
to be on the ground

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:06.940
level of the next big thing.

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:07.940
MARTIN AGUINIS: Awesome.

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:09.870
Well, I didn't want to leave
this interview without asking,

00:02:09.870 --> 00:02:10.770
did I miss the memo?

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:12.231
Should I be wearing a suit?

00:02:12.231 --> 00:02:13.980
WILL LARCHE: You should
be wearing a suit.

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:15.705
You should be wearing
a suit every day.

00:02:15.705 --> 00:02:16.200
MARTIN AGUINIS: Awesome.

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:17.040
Well, thanks so much, Will.

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:17.970
WILL LARCHE: Sure.

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:19.780
Thanks, Martin.
