00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:03.500
You have finally finished your graduate work and clinical

00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:06.740
fellowship after many years. And are excited to become

00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:10.235
faculty at a research hospital studying the genetics of

00:00:10.235 --> 00:00:14.130
cranial-facial development. You are soon presented with a case

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:16.040
where a family has a child with an ear

00:00:16.040 --> 00:00:19.220
condition. Where the external part of the ears malformed

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:22.610
and enclosed to the outside environment. This is similar

00:00:22.610 --> 00:00:25.310
to a set of phenotypes observed for a trait

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:29.190
called Microtia. A congenital underdevelopment of the

00:00:29.190 --> 00:00:32.159
outer ear. Now let's continue this hypothetical a

00:00:32.159 --> 00:00:35.410
little bit more. Groundbreaking work from another

00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:37.510
lab has shown that a major cause of

00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:40.610
Microtia, is caused by a particular allele

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:43.250
on Chromosome 14. It turns out that this

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:47.410
particular allele promotes enhanced expression of gene

00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:51.390
Y, which is the gene that causes microtia.

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:54.490
You begin to hypothesize that you could develop

00:00:54.490 --> 00:00:56.740
a drug that might change the effect of this

00:00:56.740 --> 00:01:00.690
gene during development. To prevent children from developing

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:04.989
microtia. Assuming that the microtia allele on chromosome 14

00:01:04.989 --> 00:01:07.590
directly effects gene y somehow. I want you

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:10.350
to tell me is the particular allele on chromosome

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:13.920
14 that's causing microtia likely in the coding

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:16.400
or non-coding region. And then I want you to

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:19.710
tell me what effect you need your drug to have to achieve the

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:24.870
desired effect of normal ear development. Explain your answer in the box here.
