00:00:14.787 --> 00:00:17.120
PROFESSOR 1: This game is
inspired by Super Monkey Ball.

00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:19.525
I don't know whether
you have played already.

00:00:19.525 --> 00:00:21.262
PROFESSOR 2: So ready?

00:00:21.262 --> 00:00:22.720
PROFESSOR 1: But
instead of a ball,

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:27.470
we had a real car, a car
with real physics in it.

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:29.941
But there's still one
problem which we didn't--

00:00:29.941 --> 00:00:32.146
[AUDIENCE GASPING]

00:00:35.555 --> 00:00:36.493
Right, it's hard.

00:00:36.493 --> 00:00:38.838
[LAUGHING]

00:00:39.279 --> 00:00:40.695
PROFESSOR 3: This
is acceleration,

00:00:40.695 --> 00:00:43.994
and this is steering.

00:00:43.994 --> 00:00:44.910
AUDIENCE: That's cool.

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:46.576
PROFESSOR 3: But it's
a bit complicated.

00:00:46.576 --> 00:00:47.390
PROFESSOR 1: Yeah.

00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:49.181
The problem with this
is because each wheel

00:00:49.181 --> 00:00:50.780
will exhibit its own torque.

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:57.530
So sometimes, it will
be quite unbalanced,

00:00:57.530 --> 00:00:59.740
because the hand positions
are quite different,

00:00:59.740 --> 00:01:01.120
and it will flip.

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:03.770
I tried to mitigate
it by attaching

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:08.800
a weight so that I can
lower the center of gravity.

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:12.393
It did some job, but
it wasn't perfect.

00:01:12.393 --> 00:01:15.265
PROFESSOR 2: And I think
that this will work perfectly

00:01:15.265 --> 00:01:17.560
if the terrain was
like the terrain

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:19.410
that you will have in a car.

00:01:19.410 --> 00:01:22.307
Obviously, the physical-- where
we thought we'd reconsider.

00:01:22.307 --> 00:01:24.640
AUDIENCE: This is like driving
on the moon in a Ferrari.

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:25.780
PROFESSOR 2: Exactly.

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:28.000
And this is because when I
was doing the level design

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.041
and testing, I was still
thinking about the ball.

00:01:30.041 --> 00:01:32.940
If this was a ball rolling
down, it will be cute.

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:34.890
It will look like pinball.

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:38.655
And so what I need to do
next to improve it is I

00:01:38.655 --> 00:01:42.180
need to change the level
design and make into a track.

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:43.790
Just a track, right?

00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:45.696
AUDIENCE: Oh, that's
it flipping there.

00:01:45.696 --> 00:01:48.086
PROFESSOR 1: Yeah.

00:01:48.086 --> 00:01:49.339
It's flipping too much.

00:01:49.339 --> 00:01:51.088
AUDIENCE: It's trying
to roll like a ball.

00:01:51.088 --> 00:01:52.402
[LAUGHING]

00:01:52.402 --> 00:01:54.318
PROFESSOR 2: Well, that's
because the level is

00:01:54.318 --> 00:01:55.064
pushing it.

00:01:55.064 --> 00:01:56.540
That's exactly what's happening.

00:01:56.540 --> 00:01:57.543
The level is--

00:01:57.543 --> 00:02:00.114
AUDIENCE: Oh, so is there also
a force from behind on it?

00:02:00.114 --> 00:02:00.780
PROFESSOR 2: No.

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:03.387
Actually, the level is
all concave-- or convex,

00:02:03.387 --> 00:02:04.610
how do you say that?

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:05.720
AUDIENCE: Concave.

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:06.970
PROFESSOR 2: It's all concave.

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:10.070
It's like the level makes
the ball roll and do

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:13.720
these half-pipes, and
holes, and things like that.

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:20.544
But a car has four balls that
are going single-track, right?

00:02:20.544 --> 00:02:23.038
[LAUGHING]

00:02:23.538 --> 00:02:26.532
AUDIENCE: Yay!

00:02:26.532 --> 00:02:28.665
PROFESSOR 2: And it's
possible with a car.

00:02:28.665 --> 00:02:30.405
There's this game
called [INAUDIBLE]..

00:02:30.405 --> 00:02:31.030
AUDIENCE: Yeah?

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:31.310
PROFESSOR 2: Yeah.

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:33.856
AUDIENCE: You could have, like,
for all of this, where you've

00:02:33.856 --> 00:02:36.280
spend hours and hours
designing your amazing Ferrari,

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:38.550
but then the track
is set up to fall,

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:40.906
where this car spins around.

00:02:40.906 --> 00:02:44.260
PROFESSOR 2: That's-- I
like that that's the result.

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:45.949
PROFESSOR 1: Yeah, that's--

00:02:45.949 --> 00:02:46.782
PROFESSOR 2: Oh, oh!

00:02:46.782 --> 00:02:48.890
It's getting somewhere.

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:51.315
[LAUGHING]

00:02:56.650 --> 00:02:58.771
[CLAPPING]

00:02:59.270 --> 00:03:01.200
PROFESSOR 1: So
yeah, that's probably

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:03.899
the biggest problem we
have, because this level is

00:03:03.899 --> 00:03:05.190
designed for a ball, not a car.

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:06.402
[LAUGHING]

00:03:06.402 --> 00:03:10.532
So if you want to see
a level that we did--

00:03:10.532 --> 00:03:11.782
PROFESSOR 2: That's the track.

00:03:11.782 --> 00:03:14.187
[LAUGHING]

00:03:14.187 --> 00:03:14.984
[CLAPPING]

00:03:14.984 --> 00:03:16.900
We divided the labor,
and everybody went home.

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:19.560
And it was like OK, I
guess I need to do a level.

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:22.484
And then I did a level, but
I had a ball to test it.

00:03:22.484 --> 00:03:24.900
I didn't have the car, because
the car was being worked on

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:25.890
at the time.

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:28.620
I actually-- we started a
completely new level that

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:31.620
is almost ready to
go, but it's for cars,

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:36.320
which means that there's no big
ramps, and falls, and so forth.

00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:39.837
The shape it has is
like a bowl that you

00:03:39.837 --> 00:03:43.018
put a marble inside it.

00:03:43.018 --> 00:03:43.518
It's cute.

00:03:43.518 --> 00:03:44.718
I mean, it's cute.

00:03:44.718 --> 00:03:46.825
AUDIENCE: How did you
create the giant levels?

00:03:46.825 --> 00:03:47.700
PROFESSOR 1: Blender.

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:48.460
PROFESSOR 2: In Blender.

00:03:48.460 --> 00:03:49.620
AUDIENCE: In
Blender-- OK, so it's

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:51.286
a three-dimensional
object that just has

00:03:51.286 --> 00:03:52.540
a rigid body attached to it.

00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:54.460
PROFESSOR 2: Yeah, it's just
a mesh rigid-- rigid body.

00:03:54.460 --> 00:03:55.380
AUDIENCE: Oh, wow.

00:03:55.380 --> 00:03:57.780
PROFESSOR 2: Which-- that's
a big discovery, too,

00:03:57.780 --> 00:04:02.880
because apparently,
there is a limit

00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:07.140
in polygons to what a
mesh rigid body can have.

00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:11.505
But also, if it's
too low resolution,

00:04:11.505 --> 00:04:13.160
the physics don't work.

00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:16.230
The edges are too sharp.

00:04:16.230 --> 00:04:18.570
So I'm assuming that
if there's the need

00:04:18.570 --> 00:04:21.720
to create a beautiful track,
a lot of the objects that

00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:24.290
are the actual terrain-- they
need to be very low resolution,

00:04:24.290 --> 00:04:26.774
and then this would be
a very fancy mesh on top

00:04:26.774 --> 00:04:27.440
of it hiding it.

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:30.420
Which sounds obvious
now, but at the time.

00:04:30.420 --> 00:04:33.110
PROFESSOR 1: May I
say, if you place

00:04:33.110 --> 00:04:37.220
this track in a very
high resolution wall,

00:04:37.220 --> 00:04:38.190
it also doesn't work.

00:04:38.190 --> 00:04:39.630
It's just really jittery.

00:04:39.630 --> 00:04:42.750
So I put this online
just to test my car.

00:04:42.750 --> 00:04:45.840
And if I go forward,
it will go crazy.

00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:48.840
The camera will go crazy.

00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:52.160
So yeah, it doesn't really work.

00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:54.248
[LAUGHING]

00:04:59.264 --> 00:05:01.877
[INAUDIBLE] the keyboard.

00:05:01.877 --> 00:05:03.514
I've never [INAUDIBLE] this.

00:05:03.514 --> 00:05:05.055
PROFESSOR 2: But
you see this is more

00:05:05.055 --> 00:05:07.450
like it should be-- the
level terrain should be more

00:05:07.450 --> 00:05:07.650
like this.

00:05:07.650 --> 00:05:08.400
PROFESSOR 1: Yeah.

00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:11.389
PROFESSOR 2: Not like
Super Monkey Ball.
