00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:08.950
I know nine to five tae-il when de

00:00:08.950 --> 00:00:08.960
I know nine to five tae-il when de
 

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:14.629
I know nine to five tae-il when de
science guy and I look the role widens

00:00:14.629 --> 00:00:14.639
science guy and I look the role widens
 

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:19.099
science guy and I look the role widens
face go on to level Aaron the science

00:00:19.099 --> 00:00:19.109
face go on to level Aaron the science
 

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:19.670
face go on to level Aaron the science
guy

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:19.680
guy
 

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:22.700
guy
good to see you why does space go on

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:22.710
good to see you why does space go on
 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:25.370
good to see you why does space go on
forever yeah that's a that's a great

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:25.380
forever yeah that's a that's a great
 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:28.099
forever yeah that's a that's a great
question that's a deep question and no

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:28.109
question that's a deep question and no
 

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:30.380
question that's a deep question and no
one really knows the actual answer to

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:30.390
one really knows the actual answer to
 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:32.690
one really knows the actual answer to
that maybe you will be the one who

00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:32.700
that maybe you will be the one who
 

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:34.190
that maybe you will be the one who
figures it out but near as we can tell

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:34.200
figures it out but near as we can tell
 

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:37.610
figures it out but near as we can tell
the farther we look into space farther

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:37.620
the farther we look into space farther
 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:41.869
the farther we look into space farther
it seems to go with that said we can see

00:00:41.869 --> 00:00:41.879
it seems to go with that said we can see
 

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:45.520
it seems to go with that said we can see
that all the stars are moving apart and

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:45.530
that all the stars are moving apart and
 

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:49.010
that all the stars are moving apart and
so people have figured out that they

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:49.020
so people have figured out that they
 

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:52.220
so people have figured out that they
must have all been at one place about

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:52.230
must have all been at one place about
 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:54.880
must have all been at one place about
thirteen point six billion years ago and

00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:54.890
thirteen point six billion years ago and
 

00:00:54.890 --> 00:00:59.090
thirteen point six billion years ago and
so people can observe light that we

00:00:59.090 --> 00:00:59.100
so people can observe light that we
 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:00.799
so people can observe light that we
believe is thirteen point six billion

00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:00.809
believe is thirteen point six billion
 

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:04.579
believe is thirteen point six billion
years old but nobody knows what's beyond

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:04.589
years old but nobody knows what's beyond
 

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:07.609
years old but nobody knows what's beyond
that or if it's even if it is even a

00:01:07.609 --> 00:01:07.619
that or if it's even if it is even a
 

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:09.890
that or if it's even if it is even a
meaningful question to ask what's beyond

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:09.900
meaningful question to ask what's beyond
 

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:13.460
meaningful question to ask what's beyond
that like what would the world be like

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:13.470
that like what would the world be like
 

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:16.760
that like what would the world be like
if there were no world uh it would be

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:16.770
if there were no world uh it would be
 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:19.550
if there were no world uh it would be
different and so these are deep deep

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:19.560
different and so these are deep deep
 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:21.830
different and so these are deep deep
questions and the people who think about

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:21.840
questions and the people who think about
 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:24.039
questions and the people who think about
these questions are called

00:01:24.039 --> 00:01:24.049
these questions are called
 

00:01:24.049 --> 00:01:27.050
these questions are called
astrophysicists they study the motion of

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:27.060
astrophysicists they study the motion of
 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:30.310
astrophysicists they study the motion of
stars physics is the study of motion and

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:30.320
stars physics is the study of motion and
 

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:33.530
stars physics is the study of motion and
Astro has to do with stars so perhaps

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:33.540
Astro has to do with stars so perhaps
 

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:36.050
Astro has to do with stars so perhaps
you will be an astrophysicist who

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:36.060
you will be an astrophysicist who
 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:43.410
you will be an astrophysicist who
figures this out cool question

00:01:43.410 --> 00:01:43.420
 

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:45.479
you
