[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:07.584 --> 00:00:08.370
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:10.840
- I think the world needs
a SpongeBob musical.

00:00:10.840 --> 00:00:12.580
- What is so appealing
about SpongeBob

00:00:12.580 --> 00:00:16.805
to such a broad demographic
is an optimism at his core.

00:00:16.805 --> 00:00:17.555
- I'm a fan, dude.

00:00:17.555 --> 00:00:19.720
This is not made up.

00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:22.920
- We are drawing on the biggest
pop stars in music today.

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:24.700
- We got songs from
a lot of people.

00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:28.120
- We are making the show in the
spirit of SpongeBob himself.

00:00:28.120 --> 00:00:34.973
That he's here to say,
let's have the bad day ever.

00:00:34.973 --> 00:00:35.960
[END PLAYBACK]

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:38.600
ALLEN: Broadway's best creative
minds reimagine and bring

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:41.780
to life the beloved Nickelodeon
series with humor, heart,

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:45.170
and pure theatricality in a
party for the eyes and ears.

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:47.420
Be there when SpongeBob
and all of Bikini Bottom

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:50.780
face catastrophe until a
most unexpected hero rises

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:52.220
to take center stage.

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:56.060
The show has recently been
nominated for 12 Tony awards.

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:58.710
So let's kick this off and
we'll get into the songs here.

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:01.190
We're going to start out
with a song called "BFF."

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:03.530
Here we find
SpongeBob and Patrick,

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:05.390
shortly after the
citizens of Bikini Bottom

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:08.930
have learned that a nearby
volcano, Mount Humongous,

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:12.330
will erupt the following
day and destroy the town.

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:13.130
I lost my place.

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:13.730
There we go.

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:15.500
To Patrick's
distress, his friends

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:19.370
are stuck at home without a TV
but SpongeBob shows his friends

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:22.070
that imagination can get
them through any crisis.

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:24.260
Here to sing "BFF,"
please help me welcome

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:26.424
Curtis Holbrook and
Brian Ray Norris.

00:04:07.592 --> 00:04:08.300
ALLEN: All right.

00:04:11.290 --> 00:04:12.510
So Brian, you stay up here.

00:04:12.510 --> 00:04:14.520
We're going to get to
the next song called,

00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:15.840
"Daddy Knows Best."

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:18.660
All citizens of Bikini Bottom
have different responses

00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:19.350
to crisis.

00:04:19.350 --> 00:04:22.290
Mr. Krabs, owner of the
most popular restaurant

00:04:22.290 --> 00:04:24.630
in town, the Krusty
Krab, sees an opportunity

00:04:24.630 --> 00:04:26.550
to make some quick cash.

00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:28.230
Here, we find Mr.
Krabs, as he attempts

00:04:28.230 --> 00:04:30.810
to teach his daughter,
Pearl, about what's

00:04:30.810 --> 00:04:31.795
most important in life.

00:04:31.795 --> 00:04:33.420
Here to sing "Daddy
Knows Best," again,

00:04:33.420 --> 00:04:35.190
is Brian, and Jai'Len Josey.

00:07:01.482 --> 00:07:02.440
ALLEN: Very, very cool.

00:07:02.440 --> 00:07:02.940
All right.

00:07:02.940 --> 00:07:07.227
So awkward transition to
some seating stuff, I guess.

00:07:07.227 --> 00:07:08.560
Yeah, we'll just do it this way.

00:07:08.560 --> 00:07:09.768
Everybody else come on stage.

00:07:09.768 --> 00:07:13.390
We're also welcoming two more
to the cast, Lily and Curtis.

00:07:13.390 --> 00:07:14.304
How you doing?

00:07:14.304 --> 00:07:15.220
WESLEY TAYLOR: Wesley.

00:07:15.220 --> 00:07:16.240
ALLEN: Sorry, Wes.

00:07:16.240 --> 00:07:17.615
Curtis is over there.

00:07:17.615 --> 00:07:18.490
Curtis is over there.

00:07:18.490 --> 00:07:19.656
WESLEY TAYLOR: How dare you.

00:07:19.656 --> 00:07:20.800
ALLEN: How dare you, yes.

00:07:20.800 --> 00:07:23.260
Get evil on me.

00:07:23.260 --> 00:07:25.090
Have you two introduce
yourselves, please.

00:07:25.090 --> 00:07:26.624
So we can get--

00:07:26.624 --> 00:07:28.290
WESLEY TAYLOR: My
name is Wesley Taylor.

00:07:28.290 --> 00:07:31.540
I play Sheldon J Plankton.

00:07:31.540 --> 00:07:33.022
ALLEN: The evil one.

00:07:33.022 --> 00:07:34.480
LILLI COOPER: And
I'm Lilli Cooper.

00:07:34.480 --> 00:07:36.805
I play Sandy Jennifer Cheeks.

00:07:36.805 --> 00:07:38.680
[LAUGHTER]

00:07:38.680 --> 00:07:41.700
ALLEN: Does anybody need water,
Brian after singing like that?

00:07:41.700 --> 00:07:42.280
BRIAN RAY NORRIS: No, I'm good.

00:07:42.280 --> 00:07:42.480
JAE'LEN JOSEY: Sure.

00:07:42.480 --> 00:07:43.200
ALLEN: You're good.

00:07:43.200 --> 00:07:43.750
All right.

00:07:43.750 --> 00:07:43.990
Sorry.

00:07:43.990 --> 00:07:45.490
We actually forgot
to set the water.

00:07:45.490 --> 00:07:46.175
So--

00:07:46.175 --> 00:07:47.320
WESLEY TAYLOR: Get me one.

00:07:47.320 --> 00:07:51.345
ALLEN: Behind the
scenes, live theater.

00:07:51.345 --> 00:07:52.810
WESLEY TAYLOR: Oh, Jesus.

00:07:52.810 --> 00:07:55.579
ALLEN: Put that anywhere.

00:07:55.579 --> 00:07:56.870
WESLEY TAYLOR: It's going well.

00:07:56.870 --> 00:07:58.620
It's going really well, guys.

00:07:59.544 --> 00:08:01.210
LILLI COOPER: At least
she sings pretty.

00:08:01.210 --> 00:08:02.930
[LAUGHTER]

00:08:02.930 --> 00:08:05.110
ALLEN: Jae'Len was--
what did you call her,

00:08:05.110 --> 00:08:06.027
12 out of 10, earlier?

00:08:06.027 --> 00:08:07.318
LILLI COOPER: Yeah, she was on.

00:08:07.318 --> 00:08:07.962
She was on.

00:08:07.962 --> 00:08:09.670
ALLEN: She was really
excited to be here.

00:08:09.670 --> 00:08:13.932
They've all had Google food and
they're all a little hyped up.

00:08:13.932 --> 00:08:15.640
Did any of you actually
watch "SpongeBob"

00:08:15.640 --> 00:08:16.556
when you were younger?

00:08:16.556 --> 00:08:18.501
JAE'LEN JOSEY: Yup.

00:08:18.501 --> 00:08:19.750
LILLI COOPER: Yeah, I did too.

00:08:19.750 --> 00:08:22.150
WESLEY TAYLOR: It was like
yesterday for Jae'Len,

00:08:22.150 --> 00:08:23.329
growing up, I mean.

00:08:23.329 --> 00:08:24.370
LILLI COOPER: Growing up.

00:08:24.370 --> 00:08:24.890
JAE'LEN JOSEY: Yes.

00:08:24.890 --> 00:08:25.510
ALLEN: Growing up.

00:08:25.510 --> 00:08:25.720
So--

00:08:25.720 --> 00:08:25.930
LILLI COOPER: I did.

00:08:25.930 --> 00:08:26.513
I totally did.

00:08:26.513 --> 00:08:28.465
Do you guys remember Xanga?

00:08:28.465 --> 00:08:29.465
It was like pre-mySpace.

00:08:29.465 --> 00:08:30.993
ALLEN: The blog?

00:08:30.993 --> 00:08:33.159
LILLI COOPER: Yeah, you
could like theme your pages.

00:08:33.159 --> 00:08:34.659
And mine was
"SpongeBob" themed when

00:08:34.659 --> 00:08:36.169
I was in Junior High School.

00:08:36.169 --> 00:08:36.669
ALLEN: Wow.

00:08:36.669 --> 00:08:38.530
So coming into these
characters, did

00:08:38.530 --> 00:08:39.929
you have any
preconceived notions

00:08:39.929 --> 00:08:42.470
of what "SpongeBob" would be or
what the characters would be?

00:08:46.997 --> 00:08:48.830
WESLEY TAYLOR: No, I
actually didn't grow up

00:08:48.830 --> 00:08:49.579
watching the show.

00:08:49.579 --> 00:08:53.480
I was more of like a "Doug,"
"Rugrats" generation.

00:08:53.480 --> 00:08:55.161
But then "SpongeBob" was after.

00:08:55.161 --> 00:08:56.660
And I would see it
in the background

00:08:56.660 --> 00:08:59.070
of-- on the TV and periphery.

00:08:59.070 --> 00:09:02.210
And I recognized that
it was a clever, smarter

00:09:02.210 --> 00:09:03.950
than the average cartoon.

00:09:03.950 --> 00:09:06.800
And when I got offered
a reading, not the part,

00:09:06.800 --> 00:09:09.480
but a reading, the final
workshop before Broadway.

00:09:09.480 --> 00:09:13.550
And so I drilled Doug Lawrence,
the voice actor for Plankton,

00:09:13.550 --> 00:09:17.540
in my ear for weeks, and just
tried to get it perfectly.

00:09:17.540 --> 00:09:20.120
And then I got to the reading
and Tina Landau, our Director,

00:09:20.120 --> 00:09:22.328
was like, we're not going
to be doing impersonations.

00:09:22.328 --> 00:09:24.110
We're going to
split the difference

00:09:24.110 --> 00:09:27.780
and bring a human interpretation
to pay homage of course,

00:09:27.780 --> 00:09:31.340
to the cartoon but
bring ourselves to it.

00:09:31.340 --> 00:09:32.420
That wasn't the question.

00:09:32.420 --> 00:09:33.450
[LAUGHTER]

00:09:33.450 --> 00:09:36.020
ALLEN: That was actually
a really good question.

00:09:36.020 --> 00:09:37.520
Where you are now,
give us a sample.

00:09:37.520 --> 00:09:39.230
Can you give us an
example of a line

00:09:39.230 --> 00:09:40.880
where you are now
versus where you

00:09:40.880 --> 00:09:42.320
wanted to take it originally?

00:09:42.320 --> 00:09:44.690
WESLEY TAYLOR:
Yeah, that is good.

00:09:44.690 --> 00:09:48.680
So like my first line in the
show is, quiet, computer wife.

00:09:48.680 --> 00:09:52.160
This time it didn't work.

00:09:52.160 --> 00:09:56.450
[LAUGHTER]

00:09:56.450 --> 00:09:59.900
But I try to bring
a little bit more--

00:09:59.900 --> 00:10:02.000
for the intro, I think
it's important to establish

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:07.220
the voice to help adjust to
people's ears from the cartoon.

00:10:07.220 --> 00:10:11.060
But then you can sort of scale
back, the more you're on stage

00:10:11.060 --> 00:10:13.250
and bring a little bit
more humanity to it

00:10:13.250 --> 00:10:14.165
in your own voice.

00:10:14.165 --> 00:10:16.790
So I try to split the difference
between this voice that you're

00:10:16.790 --> 00:10:20.360
hearing right now and the
voice that I just did.

00:10:20.360 --> 00:10:21.710
ALLEN: And were any challenge--

00:10:21.710 --> 00:10:24.370
I guess, was any challenges
for the physicality,

00:10:24.370 --> 00:10:29.320
going from a single celled
organism to multicellular?

00:10:29.320 --> 00:10:31.820
WESLEY TAYLOR: They put me in
this incubator that shrinks me

00:10:31.820 --> 00:10:33.111
every single night before the--

00:10:33.111 --> 00:10:37.400
[CHUCKLE] no, it's
like really about just

00:10:37.400 --> 00:10:38.400
using your imagination.

00:10:38.400 --> 00:10:40.550
And again, we
adjust people's eyes

00:10:40.550 --> 00:10:42.110
at the very beginning
with my intro.

00:10:42.110 --> 00:10:45.020
I have a finger puppet that's
a tiny little Plankton.

00:10:45.020 --> 00:10:48.080
And then we get rid of
it within the first 60

00:10:48.080 --> 00:10:51.380
seconds of that intro so
that people can get it.

00:10:51.380 --> 00:10:54.500
And I think in Chicago,
he had the finger puppet

00:10:54.500 --> 00:10:55.280
the whole show.

00:10:55.280 --> 00:10:57.334
And I really voted
to get rid of it.

00:10:57.334 --> 00:10:59.750
Because I think we need to
treat our audience like they're

00:10:59.750 --> 00:11:02.150
a little smarter than that.

00:11:02.150 --> 00:11:03.529
And I think they totally get it.

00:11:03.529 --> 00:11:04.820
LILLI COOPER: Yeah, absolutely.

00:11:04.820 --> 00:11:08.000
ALLEN: So for the rest of you,
did anything change between--

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:10.477
Jae'Len, you're like
mesmerized with these captions.

00:11:10.477 --> 00:11:12.305
[LAUGHTER]

00:11:12.305 --> 00:11:15.305
JAE'LEN JOSEY: They're
really going fast.

00:11:15.305 --> 00:11:16.930
WESLEY TAYLOR: Be
careful what you say.

00:11:16.930 --> 00:11:18.290
This is going to get
written down now.

00:11:18.290 --> 00:11:20.453
ALLEN: OK, so for the rest
of you, the different--

00:11:20.453 --> 00:11:22.500
[LAUGHTER]

00:11:22.500 --> 00:11:24.250
--the difference between
where you are now

00:11:24.250 --> 00:11:26.164
and where you originally
saw the character

00:11:26.164 --> 00:11:27.580
or thought the
character would be,

00:11:27.580 --> 00:11:29.788
is there a big difference
for any of the rest of you?

00:11:33.320 --> 00:11:35.930
LILLI COOPER: So I play
Sandy, which is a squirrel.

00:11:35.930 --> 00:11:36.980
She's a squirrel.

00:11:36.980 --> 00:11:39.230
And she lives underwater.

00:11:39.230 --> 00:11:41.570
And on the cartoon she's
in an astronaut helmet

00:11:41.570 --> 00:11:43.160
so that she can breathe
underwater because she's a land

00:11:43.160 --> 00:11:44.480
mammal and she has lungs.

00:11:44.480 --> 00:11:47.000
And in the Broadway
show, instead

00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:49.280
of being in an
actual glass bubble,

00:11:49.280 --> 00:11:53.030
I wear an Afro,
which is just really

00:11:53.030 --> 00:11:55.470
awesome and rad to be able
to rock an Afro on Broadway

00:11:55.470 --> 00:11:55.970
every night.

00:11:55.970 --> 00:11:59.450
And it's sort of
representational

00:11:59.450 --> 00:12:02.060
of the silhouette
of the character.

00:12:02.060 --> 00:12:05.180
And sort of similar to what
Wesley was talking about,

00:12:05.180 --> 00:12:06.940
I even got a note
last week where

00:12:06.940 --> 00:12:08.900
Tina, our Director
was like, OK, so just

00:12:08.900 --> 00:12:10.520
bring it down a little bit.

00:12:10.520 --> 00:12:14.220
Because the pitch of my
character is very squirrely.

00:12:14.220 --> 00:12:19.430
And so she always reminds us
to ground ourselves in reality.

00:12:19.430 --> 00:12:21.530
And I always like to
think of our characters

00:12:21.530 --> 00:12:24.540
as our human versions
of these characters.

00:12:24.540 --> 00:12:26.450
So yeah, you watch
the show and you

00:12:26.450 --> 00:12:27.860
think of these cartoony things.

00:12:27.860 --> 00:12:31.430
And you think of how can I make
this the most cartoony version

00:12:31.430 --> 00:12:32.450
of this character?

00:12:32.450 --> 00:12:35.510
But what we really want is
to tell a relatable story

00:12:35.510 --> 00:12:40.545
and to make it more
human than cartoony.

00:12:40.545 --> 00:12:41.920
CURTIS HOLBROOK:
Yeah, so for me,

00:12:41.920 --> 00:12:42.800
it's a little bit different.

00:12:42.800 --> 00:12:44.640
I'm actually in the
ensemble of the show.

00:12:44.640 --> 00:12:45.590
And I play--

00:12:45.590 --> 00:12:48.510
I have like 23 costume changes
in the show where we're running

00:12:48.510 --> 00:12:50.030
around doing crazy things.

00:12:50.030 --> 00:12:52.440
But I understood SpongeBob.

00:12:52.440 --> 00:12:54.540
And so I've had the
opportunity to go

00:12:54.540 --> 00:12:56.970
on quite a bit over the
last couple of months.

00:12:56.970 --> 00:12:59.430
And Tina, our Director,
has talked to me

00:12:59.430 --> 00:13:05.610
about my version of SpongeBob
versus Ethan's version, which

00:13:05.610 --> 00:13:07.590
have to be two different things.

00:13:07.590 --> 00:13:12.060
I can't be doing an Ethan
SpongeBob impersonation

00:13:12.060 --> 00:13:15.510
because that's just not going
to pop off the stage as much

00:13:15.510 --> 00:13:18.060
as my version of the thing.

00:13:18.060 --> 00:13:26.190
So I thought initially, of
doing this like charactery

00:13:26.190 --> 00:13:27.150
version of SpongeBob.

00:13:27.150 --> 00:13:28.816
And every time she's
come in, she's just

00:13:28.816 --> 00:13:30.300
stripped it away more and more.

00:13:30.300 --> 00:13:32.180
And she's actually
come up with this thing

00:13:32.180 --> 00:13:34.406
of talking about having a dial.

00:13:34.406 --> 00:13:36.030
And she will tell me
on specific lines,

00:13:36.030 --> 00:13:38.820
OK, SpongeBob voice
at a nine there.

00:13:38.820 --> 00:13:41.100
On this line, SpongeBob
voice at a two.

00:13:41.100 --> 00:13:47.460
And so it's-- at first,
you're like, oh my gosh.

00:13:47.460 --> 00:13:50.310
That is insane to have to think
about it that specifically.

00:13:50.310 --> 00:13:53.070
But it's super, super
helpful actually.

00:13:53.070 --> 00:13:54.927
And what we found is
that we can establish

00:13:54.927 --> 00:13:56.760
the voice and the
character in the beginning

00:13:56.760 --> 00:13:58.140
and then through--

00:13:58.140 --> 00:14:01.770
she calls it SpongeBob growing
up throughout the show,

00:14:01.770 --> 00:14:03.390
and the journey that
he's on, and how

00:14:03.390 --> 00:14:06.390
he's having to really
become the hero and the man

00:14:06.390 --> 00:14:07.650
to save the day.

00:14:07.650 --> 00:14:13.030
And so his SpongeBob-y
boy voice goes away

00:14:13.030 --> 00:14:14.890
throughout the evening.

00:14:14.890 --> 00:14:17.140
It's just another
thing that Tina

00:14:17.140 --> 00:14:21.070
has come up with in a
way of telling the story.

00:14:21.070 --> 00:14:24.510
ALLEN: Tina, also nominated for
Best Direction of a Musical.

00:14:24.510 --> 00:14:25.810
Yeah, Jai'len, what about you?

00:14:25.810 --> 00:14:28.600
JAE'LEN JOSEY: What
was the question again?

00:14:28.600 --> 00:14:30.880
ALLEN: The question was,
where your character is now,

00:14:30.880 --> 00:14:32.620
how did that differ from
your original notion

00:14:32.620 --> 00:14:34.786
of the character when you
first heard about the show

00:14:34.786 --> 00:14:36.436
or read the script?

00:14:36.436 --> 00:14:37.230
JAE'LEN JOSEY: Oh.

00:14:37.230 --> 00:14:39.712
They're spelling my name wrong.

00:14:39.712 --> 00:14:42.500
[LAUGHTER]

00:14:42.500 --> 00:14:43.930
So--

00:14:43.930 --> 00:14:46.239
[LAUGHTER]

00:14:46.239 --> 00:14:47.280
WESLEY TAYLOR: It begins.

00:14:50.824 --> 00:14:51.990
JAE'LEN JOSEY: That's funny.

00:14:51.990 --> 00:14:53.420
WESLEY TAYLOR: Diva.

00:14:53.420 --> 00:14:54.920
ALLEN: For those
watching the video,

00:14:54.920 --> 00:14:56.560
the captioner just apologized.

00:14:56.560 --> 00:14:58.238
[LAUGHTER]

00:14:58.238 --> 00:14:59.404
JAE'LEN JOSEY: That's funny.

00:14:59.404 --> 00:15:01.640
That's cool.

00:15:01.640 --> 00:15:04.200
WESLEY TAYLOR:
Caption guy's fired.

00:15:04.200 --> 00:15:07.820
Jae'Len you just got
the caption guy fired.

00:15:07.820 --> 00:15:10.250
How does that make you feel?

00:15:10.250 --> 00:15:11.836
JAE'LEN JOSEY: So--

00:15:11.836 --> 00:15:21.572
[BREATHE] So, Pearl is a
whale and in the beginning,

00:15:21.572 --> 00:15:23.780
I was like, OK, so they
about to have me in a mascot.

00:15:23.780 --> 00:15:27.170
I'mma have to wear this big
Pearl whale looking thing.

00:15:27.170 --> 00:15:30.240
So I came into the--

00:15:30.240 --> 00:15:31.700
that was my first--

00:15:31.700 --> 00:15:34.310
that was my mindset coming
into the first rehearsal.

00:15:34.310 --> 00:15:40.080
So after a while, I was
like, this is literally me

00:15:40.080 --> 00:15:46.530
with platform shoes
on and just a--

00:15:46.530 --> 00:15:48.870
the only thing
personally on my body

00:15:48.870 --> 00:15:50.630
that makes me think
that I'm a whale

00:15:50.630 --> 00:15:53.460
are the platform
shoes and the hair.

00:15:53.460 --> 00:15:58.790
Other than that, you
just think me, or Pearl.

00:15:58.790 --> 00:16:02.450
But I have this--

00:16:02.450 --> 00:16:03.430
what would you call it?

00:16:03.430 --> 00:16:09.097
Janelle Monet, type of bouffant,
type of hairdo that symbolizes

00:16:09.097 --> 00:16:10.590
the-- what's it called?

00:16:10.590 --> 00:16:11.270
What's the thing
that the whale--

00:16:11.270 --> 00:16:11.790
CURTIS HOLBROOK: The snout.

00:16:11.790 --> 00:16:12.831
JAE'LEN JOSEY: The snout.

00:16:12.831 --> 00:16:14.420
Is it a snout?

00:16:14.420 --> 00:16:15.480
Someone?

00:16:15.480 --> 00:16:15.900
BRIAN RAY NORRIS: A head?

00:16:15.900 --> 00:16:16.600
JAE'LEN JOSEY: Face.

00:16:16.600 --> 00:16:16.950
Head.

00:16:16.950 --> 00:16:17.991
BRIAN RAY NORRIS: A head.

00:16:17.991 --> 00:16:18.985
JAE'LEN JOSEY: Head.

00:16:18.985 --> 00:16:20.610
BRIAN RAY NORRIS:
Quick, quick, Google.

00:16:20.610 --> 00:16:21.550
ALLEN: It's got a mouth
and two eyes and a nose.

00:16:21.550 --> 00:16:22.347
What is that thing?

00:16:22.347 --> 00:16:23.430
Yeah, I think it's a face.

00:16:23.430 --> 00:16:25.380
It's a little face.

00:16:25.380 --> 00:16:29.220
JAE'LEN JOSEY: So that thing
is for me, is the hair.

00:16:29.220 --> 00:16:33.000
And so it it's like
this large thing.

00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:37.065
I think that it looks kind of
like an over-the-top Elvis--

00:16:37.065 --> 00:16:38.190
BRIAN RAY NORRIS: Pompadour

00:16:38.190 --> 00:16:38.980
JAE'LEN JOSEY: --pompadour.

00:16:38.980 --> 00:16:39.630
Yeah.

00:16:39.630 --> 00:16:41.010
But it's not.

00:16:41.010 --> 00:16:45.714
And the platforms make me
taller than everyone besides--

00:16:45.714 --> 00:16:47.880
only when Alex is on the
stage, than I'm really not.

00:16:47.880 --> 00:16:52.230
But-- he's one of our peoples.

00:16:52.230 --> 00:16:55.320
But it makes me taller
than everyone on the stage.

00:16:55.320 --> 00:16:58.110
And in the beginning,
I thought that it

00:16:58.110 --> 00:17:00.450
was going to be a mascot
but it's basically--

00:17:00.450 --> 00:17:04.599
I'm just a cheerleader
in platform shoes

00:17:04.599 --> 00:17:05.349
and a good hairdo.

00:17:08.011 --> 00:17:09.260
Does that answer the question.

00:17:09.260 --> 00:17:12.300
ALLEN: Not really but it's OK.

00:17:12.300 --> 00:17:14.240
We danced around it
but we got the idea.

00:17:14.240 --> 00:17:14.520
JAE'LEN JOSEY: We got the idea.

00:17:14.520 --> 00:17:14.970
OK, good.

00:17:14.970 --> 00:17:16.928
BRIAN RAY NORRIS: Thank
you all for joining us.

00:17:16.928 --> 00:17:18.182
[LAUGHTER]

00:17:18.182 --> 00:17:19.140
JAE'LEN JOSEY: You now.

00:17:19.140 --> 00:17:20.240
Go.

00:17:20.240 --> 00:17:21.990
LILLI COOPER: That's
all the time we have.

00:17:21.990 --> 00:17:23.692
Thank you.

00:17:23.692 --> 00:17:25.650
JAE'LEN JOSEY: And they're
getting all of this.

00:17:25.650 --> 00:17:28.069
BRIAN RAY NORRIS: I mean,
of course, with Mr. Krabs,

00:17:28.069 --> 00:17:30.870
there is definitely
the money Tourette's

00:17:30.870 --> 00:17:35.530
that is very obvious
in the cartoon itself.

00:17:35.530 --> 00:17:38.580
And I think for me,
approaching the character,

00:17:38.580 --> 00:17:43.500
finding a way to justify
that I think I more or less

00:17:43.500 --> 00:17:47.130
just started approaching
him as a single father who

00:17:47.130 --> 00:17:50.520
has a daughter that is
getting bigger every day.

00:17:50.520 --> 00:17:54.690
And it takes a lot of money
to feed a growing child.

00:17:54.690 --> 00:17:59.400
So I think that was my way
of connecting those dots

00:17:59.400 --> 00:18:01.620
and grounding it to
something a little more human

00:18:01.620 --> 00:18:05.100
than just money, money,
money, money, money, which

00:18:05.100 --> 00:18:08.580
is very much the cartoon.

00:18:08.580 --> 00:18:10.280
WESLEY TAYLOR: I also
have an eye patch

00:18:10.280 --> 00:18:16.020
that is my human interpretation
of the one-eye Plankton.

00:18:16.020 --> 00:18:17.610
LILLI COOPER: And
two little braids.

00:18:17.610 --> 00:18:19.735
WESLEY TAYLOR: And two
little Steven Seagal samurai

00:18:19.735 --> 00:18:24.800
braids that are
representing my antenna.

00:18:24.800 --> 00:18:26.670
ALLEN: It's funny,
none of you guys--

00:18:26.670 --> 00:18:28.753
I guess Jae'Lin, a little
bit you talked about it.

00:18:28.753 --> 00:18:29.830
But the costumes--

00:18:29.830 --> 00:18:30.774
I went into the show.

00:18:30.774 --> 00:18:32.190
And I was like,
how are they going

00:18:32.190 --> 00:18:36.330
to do these animals
on stage, especially

00:18:36.330 --> 00:18:38.880
like a whale and a
Plankton, and whatnot?

00:18:38.880 --> 00:18:40.670
And-- because that's
obviously a lot

00:18:40.670 --> 00:18:42.180
a lot of different thoughts.

00:18:42.180 --> 00:18:45.979
And David Zinn designed
both costumes and the set.

00:18:45.979 --> 00:18:47.520
We'll get in the
set in a little bit.

00:18:47.520 --> 00:18:52.860
But the costumes are super
complex in their simplicity,

00:18:52.860 --> 00:18:54.540
if that makes sense.

00:18:54.540 --> 00:18:57.000
Brian talk about your
claws for a second.

00:18:57.000 --> 00:18:59.730
BRIAN RAY NORRIS: Yeah,
I mean, my costume

00:18:59.730 --> 00:19:01.350
looks like it could
be any guy who

00:19:01.350 --> 00:19:04.410
runs a deli in New
York with the exception

00:19:04.410 --> 00:19:10.920
of these huge, oversized,
massive boxing gloves, which

00:19:10.920 --> 00:19:16.620
are representative
of the crab claws.

00:19:16.620 --> 00:19:17.629
Yes, I wear a necklace.

00:19:17.629 --> 00:19:18.420
Thank you, Jae'Lin.

00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:26.970
So it's really, I think
what David Zinn, and one

00:19:26.970 --> 00:19:29.700
of the things we talked a
lot about in the concept

00:19:29.700 --> 00:19:33.570
of the design, is that
it's less about trying

00:19:33.570 --> 00:19:36.840
to be these animals
as it is, creating

00:19:36.840 --> 00:19:40.720
the silhouette of the characters
that you know and love.

00:19:40.720 --> 00:19:43.500
And you put those gloves on
and it's almost immediate.

00:19:43.500 --> 00:19:47.040
You just fall into a deep
squat and hold your arms out.

00:19:47.040 --> 00:19:47.700
And that's it.

00:19:47.700 --> 00:19:49.772
You've already done it.

00:19:49.772 --> 00:19:50.730
JAE'LEN JOSEY: I agree.

00:19:50.730 --> 00:19:51.570
Once you put on--

00:19:51.570 --> 00:19:53.400
I mean, the platforms
are really high.

00:19:53.400 --> 00:19:57.270
So you can't help but feel
to feel like a skyscraper.

00:19:57.270 --> 00:19:59.190
So just like-- yeah.

00:19:59.190 --> 00:20:00.880
Just like he falls
into his little--

00:20:00.880 --> 00:20:03.379
LILLI COOPER: Yeah, there are
some costumes that physically,

00:20:03.379 --> 00:20:06.090
sort of force you to
become these animals that

00:20:06.090 --> 00:20:07.410
are on the show.

00:20:07.410 --> 00:20:11.820
We have Larry the Lobster and he
has this very big muscle suit.

00:20:11.820 --> 00:20:14.220
And so he can't actually
walk around with his arms

00:20:14.220 --> 00:20:17.640
down because there's just
so much of his costume.

00:20:17.640 --> 00:20:21.060
So he walks around like this,
like a big lobster would.

00:20:21.060 --> 00:20:22.980
So some of the
costumes physically

00:20:22.980 --> 00:20:26.020
force us to embody our animals.

00:20:26.020 --> 00:20:28.920
ALLEN: I enjoy that
SpongeBob actually is just

00:20:28.920 --> 00:20:31.140
people in overalls and--

00:20:31.140 --> 00:20:33.690
WESLEY TAYLOR: Although
Ethan's body is already

00:20:33.690 --> 00:20:36.630
shaped like a square.

00:20:36.630 --> 00:20:38.080
I mean, his torso is like--

00:20:38.080 --> 00:20:40.020
I mean, it's perfect.

00:20:40.020 --> 00:20:40.770
ALLEN: He's Ethan.

00:20:40.770 --> 00:20:41.350
He's good.

00:20:41.350 --> 00:20:42.835
Now Curtis, you said you had--

00:20:42.835 --> 00:20:44.710
do you literally have
32 costume changes,

00:20:44.710 --> 00:20:45.550
or was that an exaggeration?

00:20:45.550 --> 00:20:46.480
CURTIS HOLBROOK: It's like 23.

00:20:46.480 --> 00:20:47.180
ALLEN: Or 23, yeah.

00:20:47.180 --> 00:20:48.221
WESLEY TAYLOR: Oh my god.

00:20:48.221 --> 00:20:49.820
CURTIS HOLBROOK:
It's pretty insane.

00:20:49.820 --> 00:20:52.300
But some of the
costumes are taken out

00:20:52.300 --> 00:20:56.320
of the visual aspect of it.

00:20:56.320 --> 00:20:58.990
I play-- there's a rock band
that comes to Bikini Bottom

00:20:58.990 --> 00:21:02.240
to help raise money
to save the town,

00:21:02.240 --> 00:21:03.880
called the Electric Skates.

00:21:03.880 --> 00:21:09.010
And so I play one of the
singers in the rock band.

00:21:09.010 --> 00:21:11.140
And we are Skate fish.

00:21:11.140 --> 00:21:13.710
And so we were on
various types of skates.

00:21:13.710 --> 00:21:16.600
So I roller skate,
do skateboarding.

00:21:16.600 --> 00:21:19.630
So it's just sort of taken out
of context, made a little more

00:21:19.630 --> 00:21:20.830
abstract in that way.

00:21:20.830 --> 00:21:23.329
But it's so fun for me in--

00:21:23.329 --> 00:21:25.120
there's another character
that I play named

00:21:25.120 --> 00:21:28.060
Cone Face, who is a crustaceon.

00:21:28.060 --> 00:21:30.430
And I literally am like
this the whole time.

00:21:30.430 --> 00:21:32.464
And I wear a traffic
cone on my face

00:21:32.464 --> 00:21:33.880
with two tennis
balls as eyeballs.

00:21:33.880 --> 00:21:37.510
So you get a
creature out of that.

00:21:37.510 --> 00:21:39.880
But with the skates, it's
a little more up to--

00:21:39.880 --> 00:21:41.680
like, yes, we're wearing skates.

00:21:41.680 --> 00:21:45.010
But it's more up to--

00:21:45.010 --> 00:21:48.245
I actually, before we started
rehearsal, was in Mexico.

00:21:48.245 --> 00:21:49.120
And I was snorkeling.

00:21:49.120 --> 00:21:50.380
And I found a Skate fish.

00:21:50.380 --> 00:21:52.004
And I just started
following it around.

00:21:52.004 --> 00:21:53.530
They are so disgusting.

00:21:53.530 --> 00:21:56.290
The way that they like slither
on the bottom of the ocean,

00:21:56.290 --> 00:21:59.110
and they're like this
weird gray color.

00:21:59.110 --> 00:22:02.770
And so I think about that
every time I'm on my skates.

00:22:02.770 --> 00:22:06.160
And something as simple
as a stop, when I stop,

00:22:06.160 --> 00:22:08.470
I like [WOOSH].

00:22:08.470 --> 00:22:11.466
It just becomes part of my
physicality, stuff like that.

00:22:11.466 --> 00:22:13.840
Or like the guitar that we're
carrying, if I'm wearing it

00:22:13.840 --> 00:22:16.300
on my back, it's like my fin.

00:22:16.300 --> 00:22:18.910
So we get to be a
little more creative

00:22:18.910 --> 00:22:20.370
in some of the costumes.

00:22:20.370 --> 00:22:22.370
WESLEY TAYLOR: It's sort
of a genius playground,

00:22:22.370 --> 00:22:24.760
in terms of what David Zinn
has established for us.

00:22:24.760 --> 00:22:28.040
And it's like, no offense
to Disney or whatever,

00:22:28.040 --> 00:22:31.930
but it could have
been a very safe,

00:22:31.930 --> 00:22:36.940
expected, very big budget,
blockbuster set, costume sort

00:22:36.940 --> 00:22:41.740
of thing with a rain curtain
and actual, more obvious things,

00:22:41.740 --> 00:22:44.980
when it comes to under the
sea kind of production value.

00:22:44.980 --> 00:22:48.051
But the genius of the show
is how creative and inventive

00:22:48.051 --> 00:22:48.550
it is.

00:22:48.550 --> 00:22:50.620
Making-- I mean, the
set and the costumes

00:22:50.620 --> 00:22:53.050
are like assembled junk.

00:22:53.050 --> 00:22:55.840
So stuff that you would find
at the bottom of the ocean

00:22:55.840 --> 00:22:58.040
is what has made up our set.

00:22:58.040 --> 00:23:00.280
So pool noodles are kelp.

00:23:00.280 --> 00:23:03.460
And hula hoops are corals.

00:23:03.460 --> 00:23:08.290
Instead of just the obvious,
trying to recreate it,

00:23:08.290 --> 00:23:11.300
it's forcing the audience
to use their imagination.

00:23:11.300 --> 00:23:14.085
And that goes with the
costume design as well.

00:23:14.085 --> 00:23:15.910
It's just a bunch
of stuff that's

00:23:15.910 --> 00:23:20.170
made into-- like a traffic
cone, and a golf ball, or tennis

00:23:20.170 --> 00:23:22.720
balls, or whatever.

00:23:22.720 --> 00:23:25.210
JAE'LEN JOSEY: Yeah.

00:23:25.210 --> 00:23:28.300
My mom-- just to piggyback
off of what he said.

00:23:28.300 --> 00:23:30.420
My mom said, this
is Nickelodeon.

00:23:30.420 --> 00:23:32.812
Ain't they like a
billion dollar company?

00:23:32.812 --> 00:23:35.020
So we could have been
underwater for all they wanted.

00:23:35.020 --> 00:23:38.350
If they really wanted
a Blockbuster thing,

00:23:38.350 --> 00:23:39.790
we could have been swimming.

00:23:39.790 --> 00:23:44.290
Electric Skates could've
been some Electric Skates.

00:23:44.290 --> 00:23:44.950
But like--

00:23:47.571 --> 00:23:48.570
WESLEY TAYLOR: I don't--

00:23:48.570 --> 00:23:50.050
Oh, you mean like real animals?

00:23:50.050 --> 00:23:51.300
JAE'LEN JOSEY: Skates aren't--

00:23:51.300 --> 00:23:54.470
isn't that an-- what's that
thing that-- with the--

00:23:54.470 --> 00:23:55.720
CURTIS HOLBROOK: A skate fish?

00:23:55.720 --> 00:23:56.612
BRIAN RAY NORRIS: Looks
kind of like a Stingray.

00:23:56.612 --> 00:23:57.862
LILLI COOPER: Like a Stingray.

00:23:57.862 --> 00:23:59.580
JAE'LEN JOSEY: Stingray, yeah.

00:23:59.580 --> 00:24:00.559
And--

00:24:00.559 --> 00:24:02.350
CURTIS HOLBROOK: But
they're not Stingrays.

00:24:02.350 --> 00:24:03.140
JAE'LEN JOSEY: Yes,
they are Stingrays.

00:24:03.140 --> 00:24:03.880
CURTIS HOLBROOK: No
they're Skate fish.

00:24:03.880 --> 00:24:04.990
They're different.

00:24:04.990 --> 00:24:06.230
They look similar but
they're different.

00:24:06.230 --> 00:24:08.350
JAE'LEN JOSEY: But he says,
those Stingray degenerates.

00:24:08.350 --> 00:24:09.120
ALLEN: All right, so--

00:24:09.120 --> 00:24:09.340
LILLI COOPER: Keep going.

00:24:09.340 --> 00:24:09.840
Keep going.

00:24:09.840 --> 00:24:10.370
Keep going.

00:24:10.370 --> 00:24:11.380
ALLEN: So I want to
back up for a second.

00:24:11.380 --> 00:24:12.338
LILLI COOPER: So close.

00:24:14.405 --> 00:24:15.079
[BLIP]

00:24:15.079 --> 00:24:16.120
ALLEN: Let's talk about--

00:24:16.120 --> 00:24:17.080
I want to talk about the set.

00:24:17.080 --> 00:24:17.860
You mentioned the set.

00:24:17.860 --> 00:24:19.270
The pool noodles,
the hula hoops,

00:24:19.270 --> 00:24:20.440
all these amazing things.

00:24:20.440 --> 00:24:22.720
The set itself is like a
giant Rube Goldberg machine.

00:24:22.720 --> 00:24:24.940
It's incredible.

00:24:24.940 --> 00:24:30.580
And there was actual bubble
design that went into this set.

00:24:30.580 --> 00:24:32.529
And does anybody-- can
anybody speak to that?

00:24:32.529 --> 00:24:33.820
Do you guys know about the set?

00:24:33.820 --> 00:24:34.630
JAE'LEN JOSEY: You're
talking about the--

00:24:34.630 --> 00:24:36.310
ALLEN: Like the
Gazillion Bubbles show,

00:24:36.310 --> 00:24:38.290
that off-broadway
show, that crew

00:24:38.290 --> 00:24:39.610
actually designed your bubbles.

00:24:39.610 --> 00:24:40.090
Did you know that?

00:24:40.090 --> 00:24:40.450
CURTIS HOLBROOK: No.

00:24:40.450 --> 00:24:41.240
JAE'LEN JOSEY: No.

00:24:41.240 --> 00:24:41.770
ALLEN: Yes.

00:24:41.770 --> 00:24:43.240
LILLI COOPER: I
didn't know that.

00:24:43.240 --> 00:24:44.323
JAE'LEN JOSEY: At the end?

00:24:44.323 --> 00:24:44.930
ALLEN: Yes.

00:24:44.930 --> 00:24:45.320
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:24:45.320 --> 00:24:46.250
ALLEN: No, I am not.

00:24:46.250 --> 00:24:48.010
LILLI COOPER: I do know that
we went through a lot-- we went

00:24:48.010 --> 00:24:48.660
through a whole transition.

00:24:48.660 --> 00:24:51.076
WESLEY TAYLOR: Spoiler alert,
bubbles come out at the end.

00:24:51.076 --> 00:24:52.290
Thanks, Allen.

00:24:52.290 --> 00:24:53.456
ALLEN: You're under the sea.

00:24:53.456 --> 00:24:55.160
JAE'LEN JOSEY: Wait,
are you playing?

00:24:55.160 --> 00:24:56.530
ALLEN: No, no I am not.

00:24:56.530 --> 00:24:57.520
JAE'LEN JOSEY: They
designed the bubbles

00:24:57.520 --> 00:24:59.062
that are make from
the bubble things.

00:24:59.062 --> 00:25:01.103
ALLEN: Yeah, to make sure
that all of the bubbles

00:25:01.103 --> 00:25:03.520
adequately fill the house and
look as appropriate as Tina

00:25:03.520 --> 00:25:06.099
wanted it to be, they hired
the Gazillion Bubbles crews.

00:25:06.099 --> 00:25:08.140
LILLI COOPER: And so that
they wouldn't come down

00:25:08.140 --> 00:25:09.806
on the ground and we
would slip on them.

00:25:09.806 --> 00:25:11.860
Like it's a very
specific kind of bubble

00:25:11.860 --> 00:25:13.510
that isn't dangerous for us.

00:25:13.510 --> 00:25:15.010
WESLEY TAYLOR: That
hurts like shit.

00:25:15.010 --> 00:25:17.872
And when it gets in
your eye it like--

00:25:17.872 --> 00:25:19.446
JAE'LEN JOSEY: It
tastes bad too.

00:25:19.446 --> 00:25:21.280
WESLEY TAYLOR: It
was really bad.

00:25:21.280 --> 00:25:23.724
LILLI COOPER: Just
Jae'Lin on stage.

00:25:23.724 --> 00:25:25.390
ALLEN: I guess no one
can speak to that.

00:25:25.390 --> 00:25:27.940
Cool.

00:25:27.940 --> 00:25:28.440
It's cool.

00:25:28.440 --> 00:25:30.898
You talk about Nickelodeon,
billion dollar business, right?

00:25:30.898 --> 00:25:33.980
So I think all the money
went into the score.

00:25:33.980 --> 00:25:35.410
That's just my guess.

00:25:35.410 --> 00:25:37.430
For those of you
who don't know--

00:25:37.430 --> 00:25:39.689
and I'm being
slightly facetious.

00:25:39.689 --> 00:25:41.480
Those of you who don't
know, this is again,

00:25:41.480 --> 00:25:43.590
nominated for Best
Original Score.

00:25:43.590 --> 00:25:46.200
The music was written
by a slew of people.

00:25:46.200 --> 00:25:48.930
I think almost every song was
written by somebody different,

00:25:48.930 --> 00:25:52.440
including, for example, David
Bowie, Flaming Lips, Sara

00:25:52.440 --> 00:25:54.420
Bareilles, John Legend,
Panic at the Disco,

00:25:54.420 --> 00:25:56.781
They Might Be Giants,
Cindy Lauper, it goes on.

00:25:56.781 --> 00:25:57.780
Every song is different.

00:25:57.780 --> 00:25:59.730
Every song is unique.

00:25:59.730 --> 00:26:03.390
How does-- when you heard all
of this music come together

00:26:03.390 --> 00:26:04.710
for the first time, did that--

00:26:04.710 --> 00:26:06.960
what was your first impressions
of everything when you

00:26:06.960 --> 00:26:08.316
were finally hearing all this?

00:26:08.316 --> 00:26:09.690
CURTIS HOLBROOK:
Well, I was very

00:26:09.690 --> 00:26:13.200
lucky to be a part of the
from one of the early labs.

00:26:13.200 --> 00:26:16.150
So the first lab
that we did was,

00:26:16.150 --> 00:26:18.356
I want to say six years
ago, and we didn't

00:26:18.356 --> 00:26:19.480
have a complete script yet.

00:26:19.480 --> 00:26:24.660
It was just to show part of
what the show could possibly

00:26:24.660 --> 00:26:26.640
be to Viacom for them
to write another check

00:26:26.640 --> 00:26:30.340
for the next workshop, and out
of town, and all that stuff.

00:26:30.340 --> 00:26:32.760
So we had songs
literally rolling

00:26:32.760 --> 00:26:35.190
in throughout that
rehearsal process.

00:26:35.190 --> 00:26:37.440
And it was pretty incredible.

00:26:37.440 --> 00:26:40.000
Tina would reach out
to the songwriter,

00:26:40.000 --> 00:26:43.080
and basically give them a
title of what the song could

00:26:43.080 --> 00:26:45.470
be and a couple thoughts.

00:26:45.470 --> 00:26:48.840
And the next day we'd have
a complete song to learn.

00:26:48.840 --> 00:26:52.620
And almost every song
that was submitted

00:26:52.620 --> 00:26:54.870
is still the song is there now.

00:26:54.870 --> 00:26:59.670
It's pretty incredible,
like first draft situation.

00:26:59.670 --> 00:27:01.340
And they're all
completely different.

00:27:01.340 --> 00:27:01.840
Right?

00:27:01.840 --> 00:27:02.845
They have to be.

00:27:02.845 --> 00:27:07.080
And Tina's thought behind
that was that the show feels--

00:27:07.080 --> 00:27:12.000
the cartoon feels very
spastic and things

00:27:12.000 --> 00:27:14.050
are happening that are
not cohesive, in a way.

00:27:14.050 --> 00:27:15.924
So she wanted the score
to feel that way too,

00:27:15.924 --> 00:27:17.301
that it was very--

00:27:17.301 --> 00:27:20.089
coming from different
genres and--

00:27:20.089 --> 00:27:21.880
ALLEN: Has this ever
been done before where

00:27:21.880 --> 00:27:24.780
they source that many different
songwriters for a single show?

00:27:24.780 --> 00:27:25.320
CURTIS HOLBROOK:
I don't think so.

00:27:25.320 --> 00:27:27.903
WESLEY TAYLOR: There's obviously
been jukebox musicals before.

00:27:27.903 --> 00:27:29.190
But this is not a jukebox.

00:27:29.190 --> 00:27:30.930
I mean, this is truly--

00:27:30.930 --> 00:27:32.730
they were assigned.

00:27:32.730 --> 00:27:34.740
Panic at the Disco, you
get the "I Want" number.

00:27:34.740 --> 00:27:36.630
You get the "I Want"
song, the third song

00:27:36.630 --> 00:27:39.090
of the evening where
SpongeBob dreams and wants

00:27:39.090 --> 00:27:40.920
what he wants for
the whole show.

00:27:40.920 --> 00:27:44.430
John Legend, you get the Act 2
ballad between the two friends.

00:27:44.430 --> 00:27:46.800
They were each assigned
a specific part

00:27:46.800 --> 00:27:49.470
of the show to write for.

00:27:49.470 --> 00:27:52.219
And I don't-- no, I don't
think that's ever been done.

00:27:52.219 --> 00:27:53.260
ALLEN: That's incredible.

00:27:53.260 --> 00:27:54.690
But yea, Curtis
and Lilli, you two

00:27:54.690 --> 00:27:57.229
have been in it
since Chicago, right?

00:27:57.229 --> 00:27:58.020
LILLI COOPER: Yeah.

00:27:58.020 --> 00:28:02.010
ALLEN: So how-- it was open
in Chicago in 2016, right?

00:28:02.010 --> 00:28:03.690
LILLI COOPER: Yeah,
summer of 2016.

00:28:03.690 --> 00:28:05.880
ALLEN: And then-- so how
long did it run there?

00:28:05.880 --> 00:28:08.610
LILLI COOPER: About a month
and a half or two months,

00:28:08.610 --> 00:28:09.540
including previews.

00:28:09.540 --> 00:28:10.040
Yeah.

00:28:10.040 --> 00:28:10.890
It wasn't very long.

00:28:10.890 --> 00:28:12.690
ALLEN: And then
how did it change

00:28:12.690 --> 00:28:14.289
when it came to New York?

00:28:14.289 --> 00:28:15.705
LILLI COOPER: It's
changed a lot--

00:28:15.705 --> 00:28:16.590
WESLEY TAYLOR: Me.

00:28:16.590 --> 00:28:17.798
LILLI COOPER: --and a little.

00:28:17.798 --> 00:28:19.130
He's here so--

00:28:19.130 --> 00:28:20.130
ALLEN: Besides the cast.

00:28:20.130 --> 00:28:22.350
LILLI COOPER: --for the worse.

00:28:22.350 --> 00:28:25.247
No, I'm kidding.

00:28:25.247 --> 00:28:26.580
It's changed a lot and a little.

00:28:26.580 --> 00:28:29.817
I mean, the story overall
is pretty much the same.

00:28:29.817 --> 00:28:31.150
I think it's just gotten better.

00:28:31.150 --> 00:28:32.010
It's gotten tighter.

00:28:32.010 --> 00:28:33.900
It's gotten funnier.

00:28:33.900 --> 00:28:36.720
Some amazing people have
been added to the cast.

00:28:36.720 --> 00:28:40.130
The music has actually changed
quite a bit, lyrically.

00:28:40.130 --> 00:28:42.900
All the songs are the same.

00:28:42.900 --> 00:28:47.250
Tom Kitt is the brilliance that
has created the throughline

00:28:47.250 --> 00:28:49.440
of all of the different genres.

00:28:49.440 --> 00:28:51.060
He's our orchestrator
and arranger.

00:28:51.060 --> 00:28:57.120
And he has created
such an incredible way

00:28:57.120 --> 00:29:02.430
of incorporating every
different genre of these songs

00:29:02.430 --> 00:29:06.470
and making them work seamlessly.

00:29:06.470 --> 00:29:10.700
It reminds me a lot
of a movie soundtrack.

00:29:10.700 --> 00:29:12.330
And I think the
storytelling, in a way,

00:29:12.330 --> 00:29:14.940
is very cinematic
in that way, that we

00:29:14.940 --> 00:29:16.710
can have all of these
different genres

00:29:16.710 --> 00:29:18.540
but it just works so
seamlessly, because it

00:29:18.540 --> 00:29:21.690
works with what the
emotion of whatever scene

00:29:21.690 --> 00:29:24.090
is happening in the moment.

00:29:24.090 --> 00:29:26.580
But yeah, going back to
Chicago, a lot of the lyrics

00:29:26.580 --> 00:29:28.500
have changed.

00:29:28.500 --> 00:29:31.820
But overall, I just think
its better, and smarter,

00:29:31.820 --> 00:29:32.700
and funnier.

00:29:32.700 --> 00:29:35.220
CURTIS HOLBROOK: Well,
when we started rehearsal

00:29:35.220 --> 00:29:36.977
for the New York
production, Tina

00:29:36.977 --> 00:29:39.060
said that she had one of
her director friends come

00:29:39.060 --> 00:29:39.726
to see the show.

00:29:39.726 --> 00:29:41.490
And she was like,
everything is amazing,

00:29:41.490 --> 00:29:44.130
and everything goes
on for too long.

00:29:44.130 --> 00:29:47.340
So we basically just made
little trims in the show

00:29:47.340 --> 00:29:51.680
to every number so that
things hit you in the face.

00:29:51.680 --> 00:29:53.180
And then we're on
to something else.

00:29:53.180 --> 00:29:54.596
So it doesn't just
linger too long

00:29:54.596 --> 00:29:57.465
in song or one scenic element.

00:29:57.465 --> 00:29:59.340
LILLI COOPER: We added
a lot of dance breaks.

00:29:59.340 --> 00:30:00.840
CURTIS HOLBROOK: A lot of
dance breaks, a speed rap.

00:30:00.840 --> 00:30:01.800
LILLI COOPER: Which are amazing.

00:30:01.800 --> 00:30:02.760
ALLEN: Speed rap?

00:30:02.760 --> 00:30:02.850
A

00:30:02.850 --> 00:30:03.370
LILLI COOPER: Speed rap.

00:30:03.370 --> 00:30:04.036
ALLEN: Oh right.

00:30:04.036 --> 00:30:06.390
Yeah.

00:30:06.390 --> 00:30:09.660
So I have to have a question
about the Foley design here,

00:30:09.660 --> 00:30:10.270
in a second.

00:30:10.270 --> 00:30:12.179
But if anybody in the
audience has questions,

00:30:12.179 --> 00:30:13.470
we have two mics in the aisles.

00:30:13.470 --> 00:30:15.180
You can start lining
up there and we'll

00:30:15.180 --> 00:30:18.420
go to audience
questions in a bit.

00:30:18.420 --> 00:30:21.790
The Foley design, for those
who don't know, what is Foley?

00:30:21.790 --> 00:30:24.070
WESLEY TAYLOR: Foley's
the sound effects,

00:30:24.070 --> 00:30:27.460
someone who is actually making
the sound of-- like when you

00:30:27.460 --> 00:30:28.890
walk, they're making the--

00:30:28.890 --> 00:30:29.980
I'm not being articulate.

00:30:29.980 --> 00:30:30.270
Can you--

00:30:30.270 --> 00:30:31.480
LILLI COOPER: Yeah, it's a
person making the sound effects

00:30:31.480 --> 00:30:31.930
live.

00:30:31.930 --> 00:30:33.240
WESLEY TAYLOR: Yeah, thank you.

00:30:33.240 --> 00:30:34.290
ALLEN: Like in
movies, when it's--

00:30:34.290 --> 00:30:36.040
CURTIS HOLBROOK: He
basically orchestrates

00:30:36.040 --> 00:30:36.980
people's performances.

00:30:36.980 --> 00:30:39.610
So like when SpongeBob walks,
like the squeaky walks,

00:30:39.610 --> 00:30:44.030
any time I walk, he is right
there with me going [SQUEEKING]

00:30:44.030 --> 00:30:46.460
LILLI COOPER: Or when I do
karate chops, you hear [SWISH]

00:30:46.460 --> 00:30:48.110
and that's all him
pressing buttons.

00:30:48.110 --> 00:30:49.060
JAE'LEN JOSEY: Or when I stomp.

00:30:49.060 --> 00:30:49.760
CURTIS HOLBROOK: I'm sorry.

00:30:49.760 --> 00:30:51.610
ALLEN: Do you do-- don't you
do Foley noises live, some

00:30:51.610 --> 00:30:53.010
of the noises live on stage?

00:30:53.010 --> 00:30:53.330
JAE'LEN JOSEY: No.

00:30:53.330 --> 00:30:54.210
ALLEN: Or did you record
them, you pre-recorded--

00:30:54.210 --> 00:30:55.650
CURTIS HOLBROOK: No,
he does them for us.

00:30:55.650 --> 00:30:56.240
ALLEN: Oh, he does?

00:30:56.240 --> 00:30:56.950
CURTIS HOLBROOK: Yeah.

00:30:56.950 --> 00:30:57.300
ALLEN: Oh, no kidding.

00:30:57.300 --> 00:30:59.380
CURTIS HOLBROOK: It comes
across like were doing it but--

00:30:59.380 --> 00:31:01.210
WESLEY TAYLOR: He has
about a million cues,

00:31:01.210 --> 00:31:02.202
over a million cues.

00:31:02.202 --> 00:31:03.910
He's like one of the
most valuable people

00:31:03.910 --> 00:31:05.230
in that building.

00:31:05.230 --> 00:31:07.990
JAE'LEN JOSEY: I stomp
and he makes it sound

00:31:07.990 --> 00:31:10.370
like the place is shaking.

00:31:10.370 --> 00:31:13.170
I don't know how to
elaborate on that.

00:31:13.170 --> 00:31:14.730
ALLEN: It's a low rumble.

00:31:14.730 --> 00:31:16.650
JAE'LEN JOSEY: A low
rumble every time I walk.

00:31:16.650 --> 00:31:18.370
ALLEN: It's the low
end of the music that

00:31:18.370 --> 00:31:23.070
makes the tenth floor here hate
us when we do musical events.

00:31:23.070 --> 00:31:25.120
We're on the 11th
floor, by the way.

00:31:25.120 --> 00:31:29.450
So talking about show
reactions for a little bit,

00:31:29.450 --> 00:31:31.330
again, we got into your
own misconceptions.

00:31:31.330 --> 00:31:33.797
But I feel like me personally,
I went, I said, oh,

00:31:33.797 --> 00:31:34.880
they're doing "SpongeBob."

00:31:34.880 --> 00:31:36.100
What?

00:31:36.100 --> 00:31:37.700
And then, I went
to see the show.

00:31:37.700 --> 00:31:40.657
And I was like, OK,
this set's cool.

00:31:40.657 --> 00:31:41.740
Lets get into the numbers.

00:31:41.740 --> 00:31:43.820
And then I started listening
and watching the show,

00:31:43.820 --> 00:31:44.944
and I was like, this works.

00:31:44.944 --> 00:31:46.510
This is brilliant and perfect.

00:31:46.510 --> 00:31:48.220
And that was my own
perfect reaction.

00:31:48.220 --> 00:31:51.010
It's now one of my all
time favorite shows.

00:31:51.010 --> 00:31:54.970
And are you finding that's
consistent through your friends

00:31:54.970 --> 00:31:57.125
or through the reactions
you hear outside?

00:31:57.125 --> 00:31:59.500
BRIAN RAY NORRIS: I think
that's a reaction we get a lot.

00:32:02.310 --> 00:32:04.070
One of the ways
it was put once is

00:32:04.070 --> 00:32:07.090
that our greatest asset
and our greatest liability

00:32:07.090 --> 00:32:10.120
is the name because people
have a very preconceived notion

00:32:10.120 --> 00:32:11.770
of what that is going to be.

00:32:11.770 --> 00:32:14.650
And there are a lot of
people who are like, oh yeah,

00:32:14.650 --> 00:32:15.670
I want to go see that.

00:32:15.670 --> 00:32:17.170
But you are definitely
going to have

00:32:17.170 --> 00:32:21.040
those people who are like,
"SpongeBob" with a big question

00:32:21.040 --> 00:32:21.680
mark.

00:32:21.680 --> 00:32:24.370
But I don't know anybody
who had reservations,

00:32:24.370 --> 00:32:28.630
who hasn't come to the show,
and ended up leaving, loving it.

00:32:28.630 --> 00:32:30.110
And I think that's very telling.

00:32:30.110 --> 00:32:34.840
And I think that's pretty
broad for most people.

00:32:34.840 --> 00:32:37.480
WESLEY TAYLOR: I feel very--

00:32:37.480 --> 00:32:39.370
this question is like
a hot topic for me

00:32:39.370 --> 00:32:43.270
because I feel very
protective and defensive when

00:32:43.270 --> 00:32:46.780
it comes to this show.

00:32:46.780 --> 00:32:48.460
Because I believe
in it so fully.

00:32:48.460 --> 00:32:50.530
But also because I
feel like there's

00:32:50.530 --> 00:32:52.540
a lot of people
who have opinions

00:32:52.540 --> 00:32:54.970
about what deserves to be
on Broadway, which I think

00:32:54.970 --> 00:32:56.440
is so silly.

00:32:56.440 --> 00:33:00.400
Because the idea
that a brand name

00:33:00.400 --> 00:33:04.300
couldn't be creative or
artistically valuable,

00:33:04.300 --> 00:33:06.250
is so absurd to me.

00:33:06.250 --> 00:33:08.920
The fact that "The Band's Visit"
is the only musical right now

00:33:08.920 --> 00:33:11.320
that's allowed to be
artistically worthy

00:33:11.320 --> 00:33:13.450
is ridiculous.

00:33:13.450 --> 00:33:15.400
If you go see our
show, you'll know

00:33:15.400 --> 00:33:18.610
that it's the most creative,
inventive show that you've seen

00:33:18.610 --> 00:33:20.890
on Broadway, in my opinion.

00:33:20.890 --> 00:33:23.500
And I went to drama school.

00:33:23.500 --> 00:33:26.620
And I thought I was like Daniel
Day Lewis when I graduated.

00:33:26.620 --> 00:33:28.780
I took myself very
seriously as an actor.

00:33:28.780 --> 00:33:32.050
And the first job I got out
of school was "Rock of Ages,"

00:33:32.050 --> 00:33:38.346
this 80s jukebox, trashy,
bubble gum, rock musical.

00:33:38.346 --> 00:33:40.720
And I was actually embarrassed
to invite my faculty to it

00:33:40.720 --> 00:33:42.219
because I thought
it was less than--

00:33:42.219 --> 00:33:44.027
I was still in
that snobby bubble.

00:33:44.027 --> 00:33:45.610
And they came and
they were like, what

00:33:45.610 --> 00:33:46.526
are you talking about?

00:33:46.526 --> 00:33:47.530
This is the training.

00:33:47.530 --> 00:33:49.700
This is comedy technique
at its fullest.

00:33:49.700 --> 00:33:54.990
If you can't identify that the
work is in all art, and that--

00:33:54.990 --> 00:34:00.910
anywho-- I feel like my career
since graduating drama school

00:34:00.910 --> 00:34:03.445
has been the people show,
has been "Rock of Ages,"

00:34:03.445 --> 00:34:05.320
"The Addams Family,"
"SpongeBob Squarepants,"

00:34:05.320 --> 00:34:07.810
not "The Band's Visit,"
not "Next to Normal"

00:34:07.810 --> 00:34:11.949
and the artistically
worthy shows.

00:34:11.949 --> 00:34:16.659
And I find that, with
this show, it's such--

00:34:16.659 --> 00:34:20.889
like he said, I am pressed to
find anyone who comes and sees

00:34:20.889 --> 00:34:24.130
our show and leaves without
having their opinion changed,

00:34:24.130 --> 00:34:27.130
their original opinion of
coming into the theater

00:34:27.130 --> 00:34:29.710
with their arms crossed,
hoping to not enjoy

00:34:29.710 --> 00:34:32.101
this corporate experience.

00:34:32.101 --> 00:34:34.600
LILLI COOPER: And it's sort of
the best reaction we can get.

00:34:34.600 --> 00:34:36.310
People come in sort of
wanting to hate the show.

00:34:36.310 --> 00:34:38.260
A lot of people have
told me that they've come

00:34:38.260 --> 00:34:40.159
to the show wanting to hate it.

00:34:40.159 --> 00:34:41.580
And then they just
simply cannot.

00:34:41.580 --> 00:34:43.330
And they sit there
with their arms crossed

00:34:43.330 --> 00:34:45.705
and then they start to smile,
and they start to rock out.

00:34:45.705 --> 00:34:48.070
And then start to cry because
it just creeps up on you.

00:34:48.070 --> 00:34:49.900
And it's so good.

00:34:49.900 --> 00:34:52.000
So it's a great
reaction that people

00:34:52.000 --> 00:34:55.179
come thinking it's not going to
be good and realizing, oh wait,

00:34:55.179 --> 00:34:56.230
I was totally wrong.

00:34:56.230 --> 00:34:59.367
And this is creative, and smart,
and inventive, and wonderful.

00:34:59.367 --> 00:35:01.450
WESLEY TAYLOR: We're all
very pleasantly surprised

00:35:01.450 --> 00:35:03.033
with how the community
has accepted us

00:35:03.033 --> 00:35:05.560
with the Tony nominations,
and the rave reviews,

00:35:05.560 --> 00:35:08.400
and everything because it
could have gone the other way.

00:35:08.400 --> 00:35:10.690
I mean, it's a stigma
with the title for people

00:35:10.690 --> 00:35:12.635
to want to embrace it.

00:35:12.635 --> 00:35:14.260
LILLI COOPER: It's
also-- another thing

00:35:14.260 --> 00:35:16.960
to remind ourselves, and
everybody, and viewers,

00:35:16.960 --> 00:35:19.090
and people who haven't
seen, is I think,

00:35:19.090 --> 00:35:21.260
a preconceived notion that
is actually incorrect,

00:35:21.260 --> 00:35:24.541
is that we are just replicating
a TV show and a story that's

00:35:24.541 --> 00:35:25.290
already been done.

00:35:25.290 --> 00:35:26.450
And it's a jukebox musical.

00:35:26.450 --> 00:35:27.890
It's none of those things.

00:35:27.890 --> 00:35:29.980
It's a completely
original story.

00:35:29.980 --> 00:35:32.540
And it has completely
original music and lyrics.

00:35:32.540 --> 00:35:36.780
And everything about it is new
and has never been done before.

00:35:36.780 --> 00:35:41.099
So it's not just a TV show
that's being put onto stage,

00:35:41.099 --> 00:35:42.890
or a movie that's being
put onto the stage.

00:35:42.890 --> 00:35:45.500
BRIAN RAY NORRIS: And I
think just like this series,

00:35:45.500 --> 00:35:49.310
in terms of it being like this--
yes, it's an original story.

00:35:49.310 --> 00:35:53.800
But it's also-- it's
not just for kids.

00:35:53.800 --> 00:35:57.780
There's definitely
a lot for kids.

00:35:57.780 --> 00:36:02.180
But just like the series,
there is super subversive adult

00:36:02.180 --> 00:36:04.220
humor, adult topics.

00:36:04.220 --> 00:36:08.280
We are covering ground like,
give me some examples, guys--

00:36:08.280 --> 00:36:09.830
JAE'LEN JOSEY: Gun violence.

00:36:09.830 --> 00:36:11.955
BRIAN RAY NORRIS: Everything
from gun violence to--

00:36:11.955 --> 00:36:13.691
LILLI COOPER: Global warming.

00:36:13.691 --> 00:36:14.690
WESLEY TAYLOR: I don't--

00:36:14.690 --> 00:36:17.210
I mean, I don't know a more
politically relevant musical

00:36:17.210 --> 00:36:18.127
right now on Broadway.

00:36:18.127 --> 00:36:19.210
BRIAN RAY NORRIS: Exactly.

00:36:19.210 --> 00:36:21.890
WESLEY TAYLOR: It is for Trump's
America in the truest sense.

00:36:21.890 --> 00:36:23.210
And it's not even subtle.

00:36:23.210 --> 00:36:24.480
LILLI COOPER:
Government versus media.

00:36:24.480 --> 00:36:25.700
WESLEY TAYLOR: It's
not nuanced at all.

00:36:25.700 --> 00:36:27.720
It's like hitting the
audience over the head

00:36:27.720 --> 00:36:29.780
with it but in the best way.

00:36:29.780 --> 00:36:33.380
I mean, I literally say the
lines, you're not welcome here.

00:36:33.380 --> 00:36:36.290
No, no, I say, you're
not even from here.

00:36:36.290 --> 00:36:38.300
Why should we trust you?

00:36:38.300 --> 00:36:42.550
It's huge conversations
about inclusion, science.

00:36:42.550 --> 00:36:44.960
Because Sandy is
obviously pro-science

00:36:44.960 --> 00:36:48.161
and the antagonist characters
are not, are anti-science.

00:36:48.161 --> 00:36:49.910
ALLEN: Well, you're
married to a computer.

00:36:49.910 --> 00:36:51.050
WESLEY TAYLOR: I am
married to a computer.

00:36:51.050 --> 00:36:52.310
So you would think.

00:36:52.310 --> 00:36:55.010
You would think.

00:36:55.010 --> 00:36:56.860
But I challenge her science.

00:36:56.860 --> 00:36:58.610
And I say, oh, next
she's going to tell us

00:36:58.610 --> 00:37:00.675
that tidal warming is real.

00:37:04.730 --> 00:37:09.080
ALLEN: That was a very
sinister turn you made to me.

00:37:09.080 --> 00:37:11.420
I was going to ask about
that, the audience reaction.

00:37:11.420 --> 00:37:14.090
Has it-- does it differ from
the kids and the adults.

00:37:14.090 --> 00:37:17.070
But it sounds like you
very clearly answered that.

00:37:17.070 --> 00:37:17.779
Do the--

00:37:17.779 --> 00:37:19.320
WESLEY TAYLOR:
Elizabeth Vincentelli,

00:37:19.320 --> 00:37:22.934
who's the main critic for
the "Post" just tweeted.

00:37:22.934 --> 00:37:24.350
I don't know if
you guys saw this.

00:37:24.350 --> 00:37:29.584
But she just tweeted, it's a
show for people ages 6 to 96.

00:37:29.584 --> 00:37:31.250
And I was like, well,
don't discriminate

00:37:31.250 --> 00:37:33.380
against the 97-year-old.

00:37:33.380 --> 00:37:37.820
But it was basically like,
every age will enjoy this show.

00:37:37.820 --> 00:37:40.097
It is that sort of special.

00:37:40.097 --> 00:37:41.930
JAE'LEN JOSEY: My father
broke out in tears.

00:37:41.930 --> 00:37:44.550
I rarely see my father.

00:37:44.550 --> 00:37:47.730
But he came to the opening and--

00:37:47.730 --> 00:37:49.800
no, he came a few shows after.

00:37:49.800 --> 00:37:52.640
And that was right when
we added the head shake

00:37:52.640 --> 00:37:57.800
to the gun, the jellyfish gun.

00:37:57.800 --> 00:38:00.320
And my father was like,
at the end of the show,

00:38:00.320 --> 00:38:03.110
correct me if I'm wrong, but
you guys just shook your head

00:38:03.110 --> 00:38:03.860
at the gun, right?

00:38:03.860 --> 00:38:05.318
JAE'LEN JOSEY: I
was like, yeah dad

00:38:05.318 --> 00:38:07.100
we were shaking our
head to the gun.

00:38:07.100 --> 00:38:09.850
And he was like, wow.

00:38:09.850 --> 00:38:13.960
Because my father, he's
a Georgia guy, southern--

00:38:13.960 --> 00:38:16.790
he had that-- of course, he was
happy that his baby girl was

00:38:16.790 --> 00:38:18.655
in a Broadway musical but--

00:38:18.655 --> 00:38:21.590
ALLEN: This is your debut, by
the way, so congratulations.

00:38:21.590 --> 00:38:25.820
[APPLAUSE]

00:38:25.820 --> 00:38:28.344
JAE'LEN JOSEY: Thank you.

00:38:28.344 --> 00:38:30.135
But he was like-- but
of course, the title,

00:38:30.135 --> 00:38:33.747
so he was like
"SpongeBob," I'm gonna--

00:38:33.747 --> 00:38:35.330
it was always in the
back of his head.

00:38:35.330 --> 00:38:38.500
But he was like, you guys
just shook your head to a gun.

00:38:38.500 --> 00:38:41.930
It was just so much stuff
that he was very happy about.

00:38:41.930 --> 00:38:44.540
WESLEY TAYLOR: Our
mayor character

00:38:44.540 --> 00:38:48.201
has plenty of lines about,
don't trust the dishonest media.

00:38:48.201 --> 00:38:50.450
She's tweeting at the beginning
of the musical instead

00:38:50.450 --> 00:38:51.650
of governing.

00:38:51.650 --> 00:38:54.590
She is-- I mean,
it's very obvious,

00:38:54.590 --> 00:38:57.950
everything that's
happening, and clear,

00:38:57.950 --> 00:38:59.690
Tina's intention for the show.

00:38:59.690 --> 00:39:01.898
CURTIS HOLBROOK: What's
interesting about that though

00:39:01.898 --> 00:39:05.720
is that most of the
politicalness of the show

00:39:05.720 --> 00:39:07.820
was there in Chicago.

00:39:07.820 --> 00:39:11.360
And the show-- we were supposed
to come right in after our out

00:39:11.360 --> 00:39:13.560
of town tryout.

00:39:13.560 --> 00:39:16.550
We closed in July and we were
supposed to come in September.

00:39:16.550 --> 00:39:18.470
And then just getting
a theater in New York

00:39:18.470 --> 00:39:21.060
is incredibly complicated
and difficult.

00:39:21.060 --> 00:39:22.760
So it happened a year
and a half later.

00:39:22.760 --> 00:39:25.580
And the show didn't change
much, in terms of that,

00:39:25.580 --> 00:39:28.830
but it's like our show was a
little bit ahead of its time.

00:39:28.830 --> 00:39:31.370
And it's actually made
the show more important,

00:39:31.370 --> 00:39:33.680
just the timing of when
our show has come in.

00:39:33.680 --> 00:39:35.971
LILLI COOPER: Right, our show
hasn't changed that much.

00:39:35.971 --> 00:39:37.551
But our world has
changed so much.

00:39:37.551 --> 00:39:39.800
CURTIS HOLBROOK: And the
things that we're in the show

00:39:39.800 --> 00:39:42.010
political-wise--

00:39:42.010 --> 00:39:42.780
political-wise?

00:39:42.780 --> 00:39:45.800
Sure-- were things
that, at the time,

00:39:45.800 --> 00:39:47.710
we were like oh,
that's so ridiculous.

00:39:47.710 --> 00:39:48.860
That will never happen.

00:39:48.860 --> 00:39:49.787
And then--

00:39:49.787 --> 00:39:50.870
ALLEN: Look what happened.

00:39:50.870 --> 00:39:51.530
CURTIS HOLBROOK:
Look at our world.

00:39:51.530 --> 00:39:52.390
Yeah.

00:39:52.390 --> 00:39:53.310
BRIAN RAY NORRIS: I want
to quickly acknowledge,

00:39:53.310 --> 00:39:55.830
Brian this is also your debut,
as well, your Broadway debut.

00:39:55.830 --> 00:39:57.920
So congratulations
to both of you.

00:39:57.920 --> 00:39:59.870
[APPLAUSE]

00:39:59.870 --> 00:40:00.560
I didn't forget.

00:40:00.560 --> 00:40:02.000
Don't worry.

00:40:02.000 --> 00:40:03.750
I think, we have a
question over here.

00:40:03.750 --> 00:40:06.140
AUDIENCE: Can
anyone of you share

00:40:06.140 --> 00:40:09.440
how did you end up with this
job and what was your interviews

00:40:09.440 --> 00:40:10.449
like for this job?

00:40:10.449 --> 00:40:11.990
ALLEN: Tell us about
your interviews.

00:40:11.990 --> 00:40:12.700
LILLI COOPER: That's so funny.

00:40:12.700 --> 00:40:14.533
Jae'Lin just asked all
of the Google people,

00:40:14.533 --> 00:40:16.947
how did you get this job.

00:40:16.947 --> 00:40:19.280
ALLEN: She actually asked me
how we auditioned for this.

00:40:19.280 --> 00:40:22.105
LILLI COOPER: How did
you audition for Google?

00:40:22.105 --> 00:40:23.730
JAE'LEN JOSEY: They
took out the slide.

00:40:23.730 --> 00:40:25.964
But they have a rock
climbing wall place.

00:40:25.964 --> 00:40:28.130
WESLEY TAYLOR: I sort of
answered this question kind

00:40:28.130 --> 00:40:32.600
of already but I was not a part
of the show like they were.

00:40:32.600 --> 00:40:34.610
Me, Brian, and Jae'Lin are new.

00:40:34.610 --> 00:40:38.510
So those two down there and
me are brand new to the show.

00:40:38.510 --> 00:40:42.660
And I auditioned for the show
actually a couple years ago,

00:40:42.660 --> 00:40:44.870
and it was between me
and another guy, who

00:40:44.870 --> 00:40:46.070
ended up getting the part.

00:40:46.070 --> 00:40:48.720
And he did it in Chicago.

00:40:48.720 --> 00:40:53.090
So-- but I'm actually
glad that that happened

00:40:53.090 --> 00:40:55.400
because I moved to LA and
I experienced some things

00:40:55.400 --> 00:40:57.100
that I wanted to
experience in my life.

00:40:57.100 --> 00:41:00.650
So it sort of worked out how
it was supposed to work out.

00:41:00.650 --> 00:41:02.240
And I'm playing the part now.

00:41:04.935 --> 00:41:07.490
And it was strange
because I was living in LA

00:41:07.490 --> 00:41:11.680
and I got an email
saying, they'd

00:41:11.680 --> 00:41:13.430
like you to come in
for this final reading

00:41:13.430 --> 00:41:16.730
before Broadway, no guarantees,
but this could translate

00:41:16.730 --> 00:41:18.540
to an offer for the production.

00:41:18.540 --> 00:41:20.960
And so I came in and did
this three day workshop

00:41:20.960 --> 00:41:23.780
and flew back to LA,
got off the plane,

00:41:23.780 --> 00:41:27.180
and they called and said
that I got the part.

00:41:27.180 --> 00:41:31.100
And so then I moved
back to New York

00:41:31.100 --> 00:41:33.270
to start rehearsals
in September.

00:41:33.270 --> 00:41:34.970
And that's how it went for me.

00:41:34.970 --> 00:41:37.970
So that was my audition,
was the three day reading.

00:41:37.970 --> 00:41:41.520
LILLI COOPER: I had three
auditions, I believe.

00:41:41.520 --> 00:41:43.940
And it was probably
the funniest experience

00:41:43.940 --> 00:41:49.220
I've had at an audition ever
in my life because the setting

00:41:49.220 --> 00:41:52.160
that Tina created in the
audition room is just so fun,

00:41:52.160 --> 00:41:53.977
and safe, and welcoming.

00:41:53.977 --> 00:41:56.060
And you can't really say
that about every audition

00:41:56.060 --> 00:41:56.684
that you go to.

00:41:56.684 --> 00:41:58.924
Sometimes you walk into a
room of very cold people

00:41:58.924 --> 00:42:01.340
behind a table and you feel
like you have to impress them,

00:42:01.340 --> 00:42:03.290
as opposed to
collaborating with people.

00:42:03.290 --> 00:42:06.620
And Tina would throw a
bunch of fun things at us.

00:42:06.620 --> 00:42:10.010
And I had to make up a
karate dance on the spot.

00:42:10.010 --> 00:42:14.150
And Ethan Slater, who
plays SpongeBob and I,

00:42:14.150 --> 00:42:15.210
went to college together.

00:42:15.210 --> 00:42:17.580
And he was in the
room for my audition.

00:42:17.580 --> 00:42:20.210
And so we got to read together,
which was really wonderful.

00:42:20.210 --> 00:42:22.940
And we obviously had like a
great history and chemistry

00:42:22.940 --> 00:42:23.840
together.

00:42:23.840 --> 00:42:28.790
So it was just a safe,
fun, thoroughly enjoyable,

00:42:28.790 --> 00:42:31.599
creative experience.

00:42:31.599 --> 00:42:33.390
CURTIS HOLBROOK: My
journey is a little bit

00:42:33.390 --> 00:42:34.890
different with the show.

00:42:34.890 --> 00:42:38.910
I didn't actually audition for
this show or this production.

00:42:38.910 --> 00:42:40.920
I'd worked with Tina before.

00:42:40.920 --> 00:42:45.240
And she just, back six years ago
when she wanted to experiment,

00:42:45.240 --> 00:42:48.240
and we did what were called
movement labs to see how

00:42:48.240 --> 00:42:52.759
these characters could move
and translate in a human form,

00:42:52.759 --> 00:42:55.050
she called me and asked me
if I would just be involved.

00:42:55.050 --> 00:42:59.040
So I did a couple
different labs, readings,

00:42:59.040 --> 00:43:00.220
in the out of town.

00:43:00.220 --> 00:43:02.730
And while I didn't audition,
every time I was in one

00:43:02.730 --> 00:43:04.500
of those readings,
labs, or workshops,

00:43:04.500 --> 00:43:05.880
I felt like I was auditioning.

00:43:05.880 --> 00:43:08.490
Because every time they could
replace me or hire someone new

00:43:08.490 --> 00:43:09.580
if they wanted to.

00:43:09.580 --> 00:43:11.380
So it was always
sort of like, OK,

00:43:11.380 --> 00:43:14.340
what can I bring this time that
will make me irreplaceable?

00:43:14.340 --> 00:43:16.161
The roller skates did it.

00:43:16.161 --> 00:43:19.595
[LAUGHTER]

00:43:19.595 --> 00:43:20.220
ALLEN: Jae'Lin.

00:43:20.220 --> 00:43:20.984
JAE'LEN JOSEY: Oh.

00:43:20.984 --> 00:43:22.650
CURTIS HOLBROOK: You
have a great story.

00:43:22.650 --> 00:43:23.940
JAE'LEN JOSEY: Oh yeah.

00:43:23.940 --> 00:43:28.080
So-- I was--

00:43:28.080 --> 00:43:30.660
I was in New York.

00:43:30.660 --> 00:43:33.420
I was doing an intensive--

00:43:33.420 --> 00:43:38.150
I was getting ready to go into
my sophomore year of college.

00:43:38.150 --> 00:43:41.150
And I was at a master class.

00:43:41.150 --> 00:43:46.037
And it was a master class that
Tom Kitt, was the one who was--

00:43:46.037 --> 00:43:47.370
BRIAN RAY NORRIS: Orchestrating.

00:43:47.370 --> 00:43:49.740
JAE'LEN JOSEY: --orchestrating
the master class.

00:43:49.740 --> 00:43:52.020
And I sang for him.

00:43:52.020 --> 00:43:54.090
And my friend in the
back was like recording.

00:43:54.090 --> 00:43:56.970
I didn't even know that
he was recording the video

00:43:56.970 --> 00:43:58.390
of the whole master class.

00:43:58.390 --> 00:43:59.950
And I found it three days later.

00:43:59.950 --> 00:44:02.340
And it went viral
like for two days.

00:44:05.100 --> 00:44:07.960
But after all of
that was happen--

00:44:07.960 --> 00:44:11.290
I was done with
the master class.

00:44:11.290 --> 00:44:15.770
I was in a car
going to LaGuardia.

00:44:15.770 --> 00:44:17.470
And I got a call
that they wanted--

00:44:17.470 --> 00:44:18.677
LILLI COOPER: [INAUDIBLE]

00:44:18.677 --> 00:44:20.385
JAE'LEN JOSEY: Oh,
that is very specific.

00:44:23.160 --> 00:44:23.820
I got a call.

00:44:23.820 --> 00:44:26.500
And they were like, we want
you to come in and audition

00:44:26.500 --> 00:44:31.550
because I didn't know that
Mr. Tom was the person who

00:44:31.550 --> 00:44:34.136
was on the director team.

00:44:34.136 --> 00:44:35.429
That's right?

00:44:35.429 --> 00:44:36.470
LILLI COOPER: Keep going.

00:44:36.470 --> 00:44:37.470
You're doing so good.

00:44:40.590 --> 00:44:42.407
JAE'LEN JOSEY: So I
went and auditioned.

00:44:42.407 --> 00:44:44.365
And I was like, I need
to get ready for school.

00:44:44.365 --> 00:44:47.990
So after all of this,
I went back to Georgia

00:44:47.990 --> 00:44:50.460
with the mindset of school.

00:44:50.460 --> 00:44:53.670
And I got the call
to do a reading.

00:44:53.670 --> 00:44:55.560
And that's where I met Wesley.

00:44:55.560 --> 00:45:01.642
And-- oh, and I met
all of these people.

00:45:01.642 --> 00:45:02.850
WESLEY TAYLOR: Nope, just me.

00:45:02.850 --> 00:45:05.740
Just me.

00:45:05.740 --> 00:45:08.120
JAE'LEN JOSEY: And after
that three-day reading--

00:45:08.120 --> 00:45:09.870
BRIAN RAY NORRIS: I
didn't do the reading.

00:45:09.870 --> 00:45:10.710
JAE'LEN JOSEY: Yes, you did.

00:45:10.710 --> 00:45:11.918
WESLEY TAYLOR: No, he didn't.

00:45:11.918 --> 00:45:13.440
Remember, it was the other guy.

00:45:13.440 --> 00:45:16.080
Remember, the little guy.

00:45:16.080 --> 00:45:17.720
JAE'LEN JOSEY: Oh,
it was a old guy.

00:45:17.720 --> 00:45:19.110
Yeah.

00:45:19.110 --> 00:45:22.030
I didn't mean-- I'm so sorry.

00:45:22.030 --> 00:45:24.643
I am sorry.

00:45:24.643 --> 00:45:25.143
Anyway.

00:45:28.390 --> 00:45:32.760
I went home and I got the
call like two days later

00:45:32.760 --> 00:45:34.280
after me being home in Georgia.

00:45:34.280 --> 00:45:38.340
It was a very weird
process when I was home

00:45:38.340 --> 00:45:41.440
because I was like I need
to go back to college.

00:45:41.440 --> 00:45:42.440
But it didn't.

00:45:42.440 --> 00:45:49.049
So-- so here we are.

00:45:49.049 --> 00:45:50.340
WESLEY TAYLOR: Top that, Brian.

00:45:50.340 --> 00:45:51.545
ALLEN: Nope.

00:45:51.545 --> 00:45:53.420
BRIAN RAY NORRIS: It
started when I was five.

00:45:57.450 --> 00:46:02.100
I went through a three audition
process, very late in the game.

00:46:02.100 --> 00:46:05.220
I mean, the show was
starting rehearsals in about,

00:46:05.220 --> 00:46:08.910
I think, two months when
I first started going in.

00:46:08.910 --> 00:46:12.330
So they were clearly
looking for just a couple

00:46:12.330 --> 00:46:13.770
of very specific things.

00:46:13.770 --> 00:46:18.990
And at the time, I was
actually in for a handful

00:46:18.990 --> 00:46:22.050
of other projects as well
that were very serious.

00:46:24.910 --> 00:46:27.150
And every time I would
go in and it would just

00:46:27.150 --> 00:46:29.220
be this kind of
dark brooding, a lot

00:46:29.220 --> 00:46:31.230
of whispering behind the table.

00:46:31.230 --> 00:46:34.290
And then I would go in
for Tina and the creatives

00:46:34.290 --> 00:46:39.840
at "SpongeBob," and it was
just this beautiful room

00:46:39.840 --> 00:46:43.047
of warm, compassionate
people, who were like, hey,

00:46:43.047 --> 00:46:44.380
you know what we're going to do?

00:46:44.380 --> 00:46:45.755
We're going to
play a little bit.

00:46:45.755 --> 00:46:48.210
You want to play?

00:46:48.210 --> 00:46:51.900
And so every week as I was
going through these processes,

00:46:51.900 --> 00:46:54.644
I slowly started sabotaging the
other ones, and going in going,

00:46:54.644 --> 00:46:55.560
please be "SpongeBob."

00:46:55.560 --> 00:46:57.060
Please be "SpongeBob."

00:46:57.060 --> 00:47:03.430
And yeah, when I got the call
it was a pretty beautiful day.

00:47:03.430 --> 00:47:05.970
And I get to share that with
some pretty beautiful people

00:47:05.970 --> 00:47:06.645
too.

00:47:06.645 --> 00:47:08.040
[AWES]

00:47:08.040 --> 00:47:11.610
JAE'LEN JOSEY: Oh, about
the audition process--

00:47:11.610 --> 00:47:14.940
I just want to piggyback
off of what everyone said.

00:47:14.940 --> 00:47:17.070
I was so blessed
to have this have

00:47:17.070 --> 00:47:19.950
been my first audition
because of course,

00:47:19.950 --> 00:47:21.510
if I audition for
anything else, I'm

00:47:21.510 --> 00:47:26.760
pretty sure that it's not going
to be the same experience.

00:47:26.760 --> 00:47:28.410
I walked in
thinking, OK, they're

00:47:28.410 --> 00:47:30.480
going to be behind that table.

00:47:30.480 --> 00:47:31.770
And it's going to be--

00:47:31.770 --> 00:47:34.950
there going to not have
any smiles on their faces.

00:47:34.950 --> 00:47:39.150
And I walked in, and they
had the music playing.

00:47:39.150 --> 00:47:42.190
And Tina was in
these jogging-- well,

00:47:42.190 --> 00:47:47.410
she's always in these
jogging pants and hair wild.

00:47:47.410 --> 00:47:52.770
And at first, before, I had this
really weird thought that they

00:47:52.770 --> 00:47:54.364
had SpongeBob behind the table.

00:47:54.364 --> 00:47:55.530
But it was actually Kenneth.

00:47:55.530 --> 00:47:58.086
Kenneth is our
Assistant Director.

00:47:58.086 --> 00:47:58.960
I thought that they--

00:47:58.960 --> 00:48:01.690
[LAUGHTER]

00:48:01.690 --> 00:48:02.492
Anyway.

00:48:02.492 --> 00:48:03.700
LILLI COOPER: Again, tangent.

00:48:03.700 --> 00:48:05.380
WESLEY TAYLOR:
Kenneth was SpongeBob?

00:48:05.380 --> 00:48:09.785
Our Associate Director, who's
got like tall blonde hair--

00:48:09.785 --> 00:48:11.160
JAE'LEN JOSEY: I
thought he was--

00:48:11.160 --> 00:48:13.830
I thought they had SpongeBob
already in the room.

00:48:13.830 --> 00:48:16.720
But for me, it
just felt so good.

00:48:16.720 --> 00:48:20.610
Because I'm already like
all wacky, crazy girl.

00:48:20.610 --> 00:48:22.806
BRIAN RAY NORRIS: You?

00:48:22.806 --> 00:48:24.183
You?

00:48:24.183 --> 00:48:24.734
Really?

00:48:24.734 --> 00:48:27.150
JAE'LEN JOSEY: Anyway, it was
just a beautiful experience.

00:48:27.150 --> 00:48:29.210
WESLEY TAYLOR: This is
your last interview.

00:48:29.210 --> 00:48:30.001
LILLI COOPER: Ever.

00:48:33.330 --> 00:48:34.870
ALLEN: They love her.

00:48:34.870 --> 00:48:36.224
She is the youngest of the cast.

00:48:36.224 --> 00:48:38.640
This dynamic has been throughout
the whole day, regardless

00:48:38.640 --> 00:48:39.300
of every thing.

00:48:39.300 --> 00:48:41.770
This is a beautiful,
beautiful cast.

00:48:41.770 --> 00:48:42.270
They do--

00:48:42.270 --> 00:48:44.340
LILLI COOPER: We
all love each other.

00:48:44.340 --> 00:48:46.702
ALLEN: We're running
short on time.

00:48:46.702 --> 00:48:47.910
We are running short on time.

00:48:47.910 --> 00:48:50.479
So we can take-- sorry, just
one more question over here.

00:48:50.479 --> 00:48:52.270
AUDIENCE: Thank you
all so much for coming.

00:48:52.270 --> 00:48:53.305
I love musical theater.

00:48:53.305 --> 00:48:54.180
And I'm a singer too.

00:48:54.180 --> 00:48:57.630
So I want to know, what
would be your dream role

00:48:57.630 --> 00:48:59.461
in a musical past,
present, or future?

00:48:59.461 --> 00:49:00.210
LILLI COOPER: Fun.

00:49:00.210 --> 00:49:01.710
That's a great question.

00:49:01.710 --> 00:49:03.293
BRIAN RAY NORRIS:
Google, the musical.

00:49:03.293 --> 00:49:07.240
LILLI COOPER: Mine is, this is
hopefully a long time from now

00:49:07.240 --> 00:49:09.984
but I would love to play Mrs.
Lovett in "Sweeney Todd."

00:49:09.984 --> 00:49:11.400
WESLEY TAYLOR:
That's really good.

00:49:14.174 --> 00:49:16.590
I got to play one of my dream
roles a couple of years ago.

00:49:16.590 --> 00:49:19.350
I was the emcee in
"Cabaret" down in DC.

00:49:19.350 --> 00:49:21.500
And I would love
to do that again.

00:49:21.500 --> 00:49:24.039
I still got another 10 years--

00:49:24.039 --> 00:49:25.080
I played it pretty young.

00:49:25.080 --> 00:49:28.070
So I would like to have
another shot at that.

00:49:28.070 --> 00:49:31.550
And also "Floyd Collins," which
is a musical that Tina wrote,

00:49:31.550 --> 00:49:33.736
actually, our director,
she wrote the book to it.

00:49:33.736 --> 00:49:36.110
And I think that's one of the
most gorgeous musicals ever

00:49:36.110 --> 00:49:37.400
written.

00:49:37.400 --> 00:49:40.820
And I don't know if I could
sing it but I would want--

00:49:40.820 --> 00:49:42.070
LILLI COOPER: You could do it.

00:49:42.070 --> 00:49:42.450
WESLEY TAYLOR: Thank you.

00:49:42.450 --> 00:49:43.500
That's I was waiting for.

00:49:46.920 --> 00:49:48.690
ALLEN: You could do
anything you want.

00:49:48.690 --> 00:49:49.810
CURTIS HOLBROOK:
I have a couple.

00:49:49.810 --> 00:49:51.780
When I was 13 years old,
I saw the national tour

00:49:51.780 --> 00:49:52.655
of "West Side Story."

00:49:52.655 --> 00:49:56.350
It came through my hometown
of San Antonio, Texas.

00:49:56.350 --> 00:49:57.900
And it was such a
magical evening.

00:49:57.900 --> 00:49:59.399
And I've thought,
that's what I have

00:49:59.399 --> 00:50:00.780
to do for the rest of my life.

00:50:00.780 --> 00:50:02.700
And I saw Christian
Borle, if anyone

00:50:02.700 --> 00:50:04.030
knows who Christian Borle is.

00:50:04.030 --> 00:50:04.580
ALLEN: He's been on this stage.

00:50:04.580 --> 00:50:06.900
CURTIS HOLBROOK: He played
Riff in this production.

00:50:06.900 --> 00:50:08.660
And Stephen Pasquale
played Tony.

00:50:08.660 --> 00:50:11.160
So it was like a pretty
magical experience

00:50:11.160 --> 00:50:13.880
that I didn't know I was having.

00:50:13.880 --> 00:50:17.944
And so, the 2009 revival
happened with Arthur Lawrence,

00:50:17.944 --> 00:50:19.110
who wrote "West Side Story."

00:50:19.110 --> 00:50:20.400
He directed our production.

00:50:20.400 --> 00:50:22.220
He was 91 years old.

00:50:22.220 --> 00:50:24.325
And I was hired for
that production.

00:50:24.325 --> 00:50:25.950
It was sort of like
full circle moment.

00:50:25.950 --> 00:50:27.540
So Riff in "West
Side Story" and then

00:50:27.540 --> 00:50:29.040
Cosmo in "Singing in the Rain."

00:50:29.040 --> 00:50:31.960
The Donald O'Connor part,
which I got to do out of town,

00:50:31.960 --> 00:50:34.954
with Tony Yasbeck as Don.

00:50:34.954 --> 00:50:36.870
The two of us together,
it was really awesome,

00:50:36.870 --> 00:50:39.960
original Gene Kelly
tap choreography.

00:50:39.960 --> 00:50:40.860
It was incredible.

00:50:40.860 --> 00:50:43.740
I have a really
weird dream role,

00:50:43.740 --> 00:50:46.460
which is the Scarecrow
in "The Wizard of Oz."

00:50:46.460 --> 00:50:47.340
JAE'LEN JOSEY: Yes.

00:50:47.340 --> 00:50:49.464
CURTIS HOLBROOK: I just
think it would be so funny,

00:50:49.464 --> 00:50:50.490
the physicality of that.

00:50:50.490 --> 00:50:53.869
And so that's the one
that I'm waiting for.

00:50:53.869 --> 00:50:54.910
ALLEN: You heard it here.

00:50:54.910 --> 00:50:56.326
JAE'LEN JOSEY:
Skip me real quick.

00:50:56.326 --> 00:50:57.730
You go.

00:50:57.730 --> 00:51:00.580
BRIAN RAY NORRIS: I mean, as a
character guy, it's hard for me

00:51:00.580 --> 00:51:02.400
to pick one.

00:51:02.400 --> 00:51:06.980
I would love to play
Sweeney just once.

00:51:06.980 --> 00:51:12.800
And Nathan Detroit
in "Guys and Dolls."

00:51:12.800 --> 00:51:14.990
I would-- but I
think my biggest one

00:51:14.990 --> 00:51:19.286
is, I would love to do "Shrek."

00:51:19.286 --> 00:51:21.579
Hello, Donkey.

00:51:21.579 --> 00:51:22.370
JAE'LEN JOSEY: Yes.

00:51:22.370 --> 00:51:23.925
BRIAN RAY NORRIS: Just once
I'd like to do "Shrek."

00:51:23.925 --> 00:51:25.140
WESLEY TAYLOR: So good.

00:51:25.140 --> 00:51:27.770
You should do that.

00:51:27.770 --> 00:51:31.700
JAE'LEN JOSEY: I, forgive
me because I might not

00:51:31.700 --> 00:51:36.860
know the names to these people,
to the characters, forgive me.

00:51:36.860 --> 00:51:38.330
But--

00:51:38.330 --> 00:51:39.880
BRIAN RAY NORRIS: Dream role.

00:51:39.880 --> 00:51:41.130
JAE'LEN JOSEY: My dream role--

00:51:43.590 --> 00:51:50.540
I'd loved to sing "Meadowlark."

00:51:50.540 --> 00:51:52.120
Please help me
because you guys know.

00:51:52.120 --> 00:51:54.980
I would love to
sing "Meadowlark,"

00:51:54.980 --> 00:51:58.998
"You Don't Know" from
"Next to Normal."

00:51:58.998 --> 00:52:01.875
WESLEY TAYLOR: Yeah, any others?

00:52:01.875 --> 00:52:03.500
JAE'LEN JOSEY: Oh,
and I'd love to be--

00:52:03.500 --> 00:52:05.090
WESLEY TAYLOR: You should
be Kate in "Wild Party."

00:52:05.090 --> 00:52:06.590
JAE'LEN JOSEY: Kate
in "Wild Party."

00:52:06.590 --> 00:52:07.730
I would love to do that.

00:52:07.730 --> 00:52:11.322
And for some reason, I
just want to be Shug Avery.

00:52:11.322 --> 00:52:12.280
WESLEY TAYLOR: Oh yeah.

00:52:12.280 --> 00:52:13.740
That'd be perfect.

00:52:13.740 --> 00:52:14.690
You should do that.

00:52:14.690 --> 00:52:15.230
LILLI COOPER: Say that first.

00:52:15.230 --> 00:52:16.355
JAE'LEN JOSEY: Shug Avery.

00:52:16.355 --> 00:52:17.140
ALLEN: There you go.

00:52:17.140 --> 00:52:17.840
JAE'LEN JOSEY: Shug Avery.

00:52:17.840 --> 00:52:19.923
ALLEN: Well, thank you all
so much for being here.

00:52:19.923 --> 00:52:23.350
Everybody, please go
to the Palace Theater,

00:52:23.350 --> 00:52:26.290
at the beautiful Palace
Theater, 47th and Broadway.

00:52:26.290 --> 00:52:28.690
You can visit them online
SpongeBobBroadway.com,

00:52:28.690 --> 00:52:33.200
on Instagram, and
Twitter, @SpongeBobBway.

00:52:33.200 --> 00:52:35.000
And then we actually
have one more song

00:52:35.000 --> 00:52:38.210
that they will
perform for us here.

00:52:38.210 --> 00:52:39.020
Did you know that?

00:52:42.290 --> 00:52:42.980
All right.

00:52:42.980 --> 00:52:45.223
Everybody help me give
them a round of applause.

00:52:45.223 --> 00:52:52.159
[APPLAUSE]

00:52:52.159 --> 00:52:54.200
So I will leave the stage
after I introduce this.

00:52:54.200 --> 00:52:59.280
This song is called "Simple
Sponge," sung by SpongeBob.

00:52:59.280 --> 00:53:01.890
A fry cook at the
Krusty Krab, SpongeBob

00:53:01.890 --> 00:53:03.690
dreams of becoming
a manager one day.

00:53:03.690 --> 00:53:05.670
But few believe
in his ambitions.

00:53:05.670 --> 00:53:09.084
Before SpongeBob can rally his
best friends Sandy and Patrick

00:53:09.084 --> 00:53:11.250
to take on Mount Humongous,
he needs to give himself

00:53:11.250 --> 00:53:12.360
a little pep talk.

00:53:12.360 --> 00:53:15.120
Here to sing "Simple Sponge,"
one final time on stage,

00:53:15.120 --> 00:53:15.810
Curtis Holbrook.

00:53:15.810 --> 00:53:16.935
CURTIS HOLBROOK: Thank you.

00:53:22.271 --> 00:53:28.250
[CURTIS HOLBROOK SINGING "SIMPLE
 SPONGE"]

00:57:13.044 --> 00:57:16.516
[APPLAUSE]

00:57:16.516 --> 00:57:17.480
ALLEN: Keep it going.

00:57:17.480 --> 00:57:19.364
One more round of applause.

00:57:19.364 --> 00:57:23.610
[APPLAUSE]

00:57:23.610 --> 00:57:24.476
Good job.

00:57:24.476 --> 00:57:25.191
Good job.

00:57:25.191 --> 00:57:25.690
Thank you.

00:57:25.690 --> 00:57:26.189
Thank you.

00:57:26.189 --> 00:57:26.870
Thank you.

00:57:26.870 --> 00:57:27.695
So wonderful.

00:57:27.695 --> 00:57:28.820
CURTIS HOLBROOK: Thank you.

00:57:28.820 --> 00:57:29.528
ALLEN: All right.

00:57:29.528 --> 00:57:30.510
Let's go eat froyo.

00:57:30.510 --> 00:57:32.960
