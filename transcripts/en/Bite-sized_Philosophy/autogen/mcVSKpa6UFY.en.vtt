brilliant piece of science is that first

00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:05.730
brilliant piece of science is that first

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:08.010
of all juvenile male routes in
 

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:10.040

particular like to rough-and-tumble play

00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:10.050

they like to wrestle and they actually

00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:12.000
they like to wrestle and they actually
 

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:13.879
they like to wrestle and they actually
pin each other just like little kids do

00:00:13.879 --> 00:00:13.889
pin each other just like little kids do
 

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:15.799
pin each other just like little kids do
or like adult wrestlers do they pin

00:00:15.799 --> 00:00:15.809
or like adult wrestlers do they pin
 

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:17.510
or like adult wrestlers do they pin
their shoulders down and that basically

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:17.520
their shoulders down and that basically
 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:20.150
their shoulders down and that basically
means you win and so okay so that's

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:20.160
means you win and so okay so that's
 

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:22.130
means you win and so okay so that's
pretty cool but what's even cooler I

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:22.140
pretty cool but what's even cooler I
 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:24.109
pretty cool but what's even cooler I
think well there's three things one is

the rats will work for an opportunity to

00:00:26.929 --> 00:00:26.939
the rats will work for an opportunity to
 

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:28.609
the rats will work for an opportunity to
get into an arena where they know that

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:28.619
get into an arena where they know that
 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:30.859
get into an arena where they know that
play might occur and so that's one of

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:30.869
play might occur and so that's one of
 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:32.900
play might occur and so that's one of
the scientific ways of testing and

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:32.910
the scientific ways of testing and
 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:34.790

animals motivation right so imagine you

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:34.800
animals motivation right so imagine you
 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:37.160
animals motivation right so imagine you
have a starving rat and it knows that

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:37.170
have a starving rat and it knows that
 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:39.530
have a starving rat and it knows that
it's got food down the end of a corridor

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:39.540
it's got food down the end of a corridor
 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:41.479
it's got food down the end of a corridor
you can put a little spring on its tail

00:00:41.479 --> 00:00:41.489
you can put a little spring on its tail
 

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:43.670
you can put a little spring on its tail
and measure how hard it pulls and that

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:43.680
and measure how hard it pulls and that
 

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:44.869
and measure how hard it pulls and that
gives you an indication of its

00:00:44.869 --> 00:00:44.879
gives you an indication of its
 

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:46.850
gives you an indication of its
motivational force now imagine the

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:46.860
motivational force now imagine the
 

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:48.950
motivational force now imagine the
starving rat that's trying to get to

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:48.960
starving rat that's trying to get to
 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:50.150
starving rat that's trying to get to
some food and you have a little spring

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:50.160
some food and you have a little spring
 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:52.549
some food and you have a little spring
on his tail and you waft in some cat

00:00:52.549 --> 00:00:52.559
on his tail and you waft in some cat
 

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:55.189
on his tail and you waft in some cat
odour so now that rat is starving and

00:00:55.189 --> 00:00:55.199
odour so now that rat is starving and
 

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:57.290
odour so now that rat is starving and
wants to get out of there he's going to

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:57.300
wants to get out of there he's going to
 

00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:59.090
wants to get out of there he's going to
try to pull even farther towards the

00:00:59.090 --> 00:00:59.100
try to pull even farther towards the
 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:00.799
try to pull even farther towards the
food so getting away plus getting

00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:00.809
food so getting away plus getting
 

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:02.479
food so getting away plus getting

it's real potent and part of the reason

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:06.900
it's real potent and part of the reason
 

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:09.289
it's real potent and part of the reason
why in the future authoring exercise

00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:09.299
why in the future authoring exercise
 

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:10.670
why in the future authoring exercise
that you guys are going to do as the

class progresses you're asked to outline

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:12.659
class progresses you're asked to outline
 

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:14.600
class progresses you're asked to outline
the place you'd like to end up which is

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:14.610
the place you'd like to end up which is
 

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:16.969
the place you'd like to end up which is
your desired future and also the place

00:01:16.969 --> 00:01:16.979
your desired future and also the place
 

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:18.950
your desired future and also the place
that you could end up if you let

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:18.960
that you could end up if you let
 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:21.020
that you could end up if you let
everything fall apart is so that your

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:21.030
everything fall apart is so that your
 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:23.899
everything fall apart is so that your
anxiety chases you and your approach

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:23.909
anxiety chases you and your approach
 

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:25.520
anxiety chases you and your approach
systems pull you forward

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:25.530
systems pull you forward
 

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:28.280
systems pull you forward
you're maximally motivated dead and it's

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:28.290
you're maximally motivated dead and it's
 

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:30.350
you're maximally motivated dead and it's
important because otherwise you can be

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:30.360
important because otherwise you can be
 

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:32.300
important because otherwise you can be
afraid of pursuing the things that you

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:32.310
afraid of pursuing the things that you
 

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:34.190
afraid of pursuing the things that you
want to pursue right and that's very

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:34.200
want to pursue right and that's very
 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:36.890
want to pursue right and that's very
common and so then the fear inhibits you

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:36.900
common and so then the fear inhibits you
 

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:38.960
common and so then the fear inhibits you
as the promise pulls you forward but it

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:38.970
as the promise pulls you forward but it
 

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:40.940
as the promise pulls you forward but it
makes you weak because you're afraid you

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:40.950
makes you weak because you're afraid you
 

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:42.800
makes you weak because you're afraid you
want to get your fear behind you pushing

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:42.810
want to get your fear behind you pushing
 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:45.109
want to get your fear behind you pushing
you and so what you want to be is afraid

00:01:45.109 --> 00:01:45.119
you and so what you want to be is afraid
 

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:47.660
you and so what you want to be is afraid
more afraid of not pursuing your goals

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:47.670
more afraid of not pursuing your goals
 

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:50.030
more afraid of not pursuing your goals
then you are of pursuing them it's very

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:50.040
then you are of pursuing them it's very
 

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:52.999
then you are of pursuing them it's very
very helpful and lots of times in life

00:01:52.999 --> 00:01:53.009
very helpful and lots of times in life
 

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:54.260
very helpful and lots of times in life
and this is something really worth

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:54.270
and this is something really worth
 

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:56.480
and this is something really worth
knowing you know and what this is one of

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:56.490
knowing you know and what this is one of
 

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:58.190
knowing you know and what this is one of
the advantages to being an autonomous

00:01:58.190 --> 00:01:58.200
the advantages to being an autonomous
 

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:00.649
the advantages to being an autonomous
adult is you don't get to pick the best

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:00.659
adult is you don't get to pick the best
 

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:02.929
adult is you don't get to pick the best
thing you get to pick your poison you

00:02:02.929 --> 00:02:02.939
thing you get to pick your poison you
 

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:04.940
thing you get to pick your poison you
have two bad choices and you get to pick

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:04.950
have two bad choices and you get to pick
 

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:06.499
have two bad choices and you get to pick
which one you're willing to suffer

00:02:06.499 --> 00:02:06.509
which one you're willing to suffer
 

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:08.630
which one you're willing to suffer
through and every choice has a bit of

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:08.640
through and every choice has a bit of
 

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:10.430
through and every choice has a bit of
that element in it and so if you know

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:10.440
that element in it and so if you know
 

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:12.229
that element in it and so if you know
that it's really freeing because

00:02:12.229 --> 00:02:12.239
that it's really freeing because
 

00:02:12.239 --> 00:02:13.910
that it's really freeing because
otherwise you torture yourself

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:13.920
otherwise you torture yourself
 

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:16.130
otherwise you torture yourself
by thinking well maybe there's a good

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:16.140
by thinking well maybe there's a good
 

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:18.020
by thinking well maybe there's a good
solution to this you know compared to

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:18.030
solution to this you know compared to
 

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:19.370
solution to this you know compared to
the bad solution it's like nah nah

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:19.380
the bad solution it's like nah nah
 

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:21.650
the bad solution it's like nah nah
sometimes there's just risky solution

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:21.660
sometimes there's just risky solution
 

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:25.490
sometimes there's just risky solution
one and risky solution two and sometimes

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:25.500
one and risky solution two and sometimes
 

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:27.589
one and risky solution two and sometimes
both of them are really bad but you at

00:02:27.589 --> 00:02:27.599
both of them are really bad but you at
 

00:02:27.599 --> 00:02:29.059
both of them are really bad but you at
least get to pick which one you're

00:02:29.059 --> 00:02:29.069
least get to pick which one you're
 

00:02:29.069 --> 00:02:30.500
least get to pick which one you're
willing to suffer through and that's

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:30.510
willing to suffer through and that's
 

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:32.420
willing to suffer through and that's
that actually makes quite a bit of

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:32.430
that actually makes quite a bit of
 

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:34.520
that actually makes quite a bit of
difference because you're also facing it

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:34.530
difference because you're also facing it
 

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:36.680
difference because you're also facing it
voluntarily then instead of it chasing

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:36.690
voluntarily then instead of it chasing
 

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:38.540
voluntarily then instead of it chasing
you and that is an entire different

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:38.550
you and that is an entire different
 

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:40.699
you and that is an entire different
entirely different cycle physiological

00:02:40.699 --> 00:02:40.709
entirely different cycle physiological
 

00:02:40.709 --> 00:02:43.520
entirely different cycle physiological
response challenge versus threat it's

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:43.530
response challenge versus threat it's
 

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:45.860
response challenge versus threat it's
not the same even if the magnitude of

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:45.870
not the same even if the magnitude of
 

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:48.110
not the same even if the magnitude of
the problem is the same and so putting

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:48.120
the problem is the same and so putting
 

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:49.910
the problem is the same and so putting
yourself in a challenging let's call it

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:49.920
yourself in a challenging let's call it
 

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:51.740

mind frame you can't just do that by

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:51.750
mind frame you can't just do that by
 

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:53.930
mind frame you can't just do that by
magic putting yourself in a challenging

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:53.940
magic putting yourself in a challenging
 

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:56.600
magic putting yourself in a challenging
mind frame is much better much easier on

00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:56.610
mind frame is much better much easier on
 

00:02:56.610 --> 00:02:58.190
mind frame is much better much easier on
you cycle physiologically because you

00:02:58.190 --> 00:02:58.200
you cycle physiologically because you
 

00:02:58.200 --> 00:02:59.840
you cycle physiologically because you
don't produce you don't go into the

00:02:59.840 --> 00:02:59.850
don't produce you don't go into the
 

00:02:59.850 --> 00:03:01.759
don't produce you don't go into the
generalized stress response to the same

00:03:01.759 --> 00:03:01.769
generalized stress response to the same
 

00:03:01.769 --> 00:03:03.470
generalized stress response to the same
degree and you're activating your

exploratory and seeking systems which

00:03:05.479 --> 00:03:05.489
exploratory and seeking systems which
 

00:03:05.489 --> 00:03:07.550
exploratory and seeking systems which
are dopaminergic Lee mediated and that

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:07.560
are dopaminergic Lee mediated and that
 

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:10.460
are dopaminergic Lee mediated and that
involve positive emotion so if you can

00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:10.470
involve positive emotion so if you can
