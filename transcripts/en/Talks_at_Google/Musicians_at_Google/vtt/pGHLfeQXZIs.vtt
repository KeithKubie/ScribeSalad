[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:06.040 --> 00:00:08.039
SPEAKER: Google Birmingham
is pleased to welcome

00:00:08.039 --> 00:00:10.710
the genre bending G. Love,
who, along with his band

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:14.550
Special Sauce, forms a group
that coined the term hip-hop

00:00:14.550 --> 00:00:15.230
blues.

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:15.400
Right?

00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:16.109
G. LOVE: Mm-hmm.

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:16.900
SPEAKER: All right.

00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:17.670
G. LOVE: Yes, sir.

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:19.830
SPEAKER: With their most
recent released album,

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:22.372
"Love Saves the Day," the band
returns to their rock and roll

00:00:22.372 --> 00:00:22.871
roots.

00:00:22.871 --> 00:00:24.860
We'll talk a lot about
kind of the new album.

00:00:24.860 --> 00:00:26.020
I found it fascinating.

00:00:26.020 --> 00:00:28.450
I listened to it on
the plane last night.

00:00:28.450 --> 00:00:32.100
G. Love's incredible career
has spanned 20 years--

00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:34.880
over 20 years
producing 11 albums

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:37.380
with classic songs
such as "Baby's Got

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:44.212
Sauce," "Rodeo Clowns" with
Jack Johnson, "Cold Beverage"--

00:00:44.212 --> 00:00:47.460
I love the mug over there--

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:49.080
"50 Ways to Leave Your Lover."

00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:49.580
See?

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:51.540
Cold beverage.

00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:52.514
G. LOVE: This is hot.

00:00:52.514 --> 00:00:53.430
SPEAKER: That's right.

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:55.290
And this is your--
so tonight will

00:00:55.290 --> 00:00:59.740
be your fourth or fifth
concert of this tour?

00:00:59.740 --> 00:01:01.850
G. LOVE: Oh, yeah.

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:02.920
Yeah, the fifth show.

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:03.280
SPEAKER: The fifth show.

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:04.173
G. LOVE: Sixth show--

00:01:04.173 --> 00:01:05.131
SPEAKER: The sixth one.

00:01:05.131 --> 00:01:06.779
G. LOVE: --of our
Freedom World Tour.

00:01:06.779 --> 00:01:08.820
SPEAKER: Going back on
the road for three months.

00:01:11.504 --> 00:01:14.730
And, yeah, it's great
for you to take some time

00:01:14.730 --> 00:01:18.109
to come to Google Detroit to
talk to us and play for us.

00:01:18.109 --> 00:01:18.900
G. LOVE: Thank you.

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:19.566
SPEAKER: Thanks.

00:01:19.566 --> 00:01:20.690
Thanks a lot.

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:21.940
G. LOVE: Thanks for having me.

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:22.737
SPEAKER: Of course.

00:01:22.737 --> 00:01:25.671
[APPLAUSE]

00:01:26.650 --> 00:01:32.410
All right, so let's go back
20-plus years, 23 years, right?

00:01:32.410 --> 00:01:33.880
Something like that.

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:37.120
Your sound is very
cool, kind of unique.

00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:38.970
You are originally from Philly.

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:40.977
How did you start?

00:01:40.977 --> 00:01:41.560
G. LOVE: Yeah.

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:45.790
I was born and raised
in Philadelphia.

00:01:45.790 --> 00:01:47.800
My mother kind of
got me involved

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:51.310
in playing music at a young
age, just probably how

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:52.450
most parents do.

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:58.390
I was drumming along the
back of the family station

00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:00.439
wagon, along with the
radio, and she said, oh,

00:02:00.439 --> 00:02:01.480
that sounded pretty good.

00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:03.107
Do you want to
play an instrument?

00:02:03.107 --> 00:02:03.940
So I said, oh, yeah.

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:05.380
I want to play guitar.

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:11.120
And so soon after that,
I was eight years old.

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:14.750
I found myself in
folk guitar lessons,

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:19.900
learning kind of old
time Joan Baez type folk

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:20.830
songs or something.

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:23.540
And I was terrible at
it, and I hated it.

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:25.180
It hurt my fingers.

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:29.050
And my mother was already better
at playing guitar than me,

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:30.400
so that was--

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:34.660
it was a struggle for the
first five years or so.

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:37.630
And then when I was
about 13, kind of

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:41.560
figured out how to tune it,
and it started sounding OK.

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:45.040
And then when I was 15,
I wrote my first tune.

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:49.990
And I think that was kind of
the age that a lot of, you know,

00:02:49.990 --> 00:02:52.480
kids kind of come
into themselves when

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:53.830
they're about 15.

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:56.570
My son's 15 now.

00:02:56.570 --> 00:02:57.070
Yeah.

00:02:57.070 --> 00:02:58.870
Once I wrote that
first song, that

00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:02.850
was, to me, the real
springboard which would,

00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:06.790
you know, lead on into a
career in music and, you know,

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:08.480
being here today.

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:11.310
SPEAKER: So 13-- things clicked.

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:15.302
15-- you wrote your first song.

00:03:15.302 --> 00:03:16.510
You still remember it, right?

00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:17.287
G. LOVE: Oh, yeah.

00:03:17.287 --> 00:03:18.370
SPEAKER: Which one was it?

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:19.220
What was it about?

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:21.880
G. LOVE: Well, I
never did record it.

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:24.320
Although, I have recorded
and released a lot of the

00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:29.530
tunes that I wrote actually
when I was in high school.

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:32.470
The first tune,
it's a good example

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:36.700
of kind of how I write songs.

00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:41.290
You know, I always
feel like a song can

00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:43.330
feel like one thing
on the surface,

00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:47.230
but in reality there can be a
lot of different circumstances

00:03:47.230 --> 00:03:50.470
that kind of lead to
this thing happening.

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:52.570
And a lot of times
also a song, I feel,

00:03:52.570 --> 00:03:55.270
should be kind of a
knee-jerk reaction,

00:03:55.270 --> 00:04:00.430
and therefore, it's kind of real
and poignant and true to life.

00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:05.410
So anyway, the first song
was about two people.

00:04:05.410 --> 00:04:07.510
You know, I had a
little girlfriend.

00:04:07.510 --> 00:04:14.260
And I think-- yeah, I was
just really, like, you know,

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:15.760
I figured I was
pretty much in love.

00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:16.510
I was 15.

00:04:16.510 --> 00:04:18.660
You know?

00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:20.200
So it was kind of
my love for her.

00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:22.314
But then also I think
more importantly

00:04:22.314 --> 00:04:27.820
it was about my best friend
who actually is my manager now.

00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:32.530
He was going to leave school
and go to boarding school.

00:04:32.530 --> 00:04:34.720
So you know, I was
kind of bummed out.

00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:38.206
I was pretty sad he was
going to be leaving the state

00:04:38.206 --> 00:04:38.830
and everything.

00:04:38.830 --> 00:04:41.810
So I had these emotions of
being in love with this--

00:04:41.810 --> 00:04:44.350
with my little girlfriend
and then my best friend

00:04:44.350 --> 00:04:45.430
leaving home.

00:04:45.430 --> 00:04:48.670
So I wrote this song
that seems like a love

00:04:48.670 --> 00:04:51.100
song on the outside, but I
feel like the emotion in it

00:04:51.100 --> 00:04:55.900
was kind of more written
towards your friend.

00:04:55.900 --> 00:04:57.430
So actually I've
kind of continued

00:04:57.430 --> 00:05:00.430
to write, like I
said, like that.

00:05:00.430 --> 00:05:04.360
One song can have a lot
of different meanings,

00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:06.560
especially to me on
the inside of it.

00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:10.120
SPEAKER: And with this one,
kind of to take off of that,

00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:12.220
your songs are
really interesting.

00:05:12.220 --> 00:05:14.014
Your videos are
extremely interesting.

00:05:14.014 --> 00:05:15.430
You've almost got
like-- you know,

00:05:15.430 --> 00:05:17.980
there's like a different
story from the visual aspect

00:05:17.980 --> 00:05:21.330
than the song itself, both
lyrically and musically.

00:05:21.330 --> 00:05:24.544
As I was kind of
preparing for this--

00:05:24.544 --> 00:05:25.960
and again, I took
a couple quotes,

00:05:25.960 --> 00:05:28.720
because people are describing
your music in a very

00:05:28.720 --> 00:05:30.340
interesting, weird way.

00:05:30.340 --> 00:05:33.050
"Groove heavy,
Chicago blues infused,

00:05:33.050 --> 00:05:34.900
brand of stripped
down rock and roll."

00:05:34.900 --> 00:05:37.780
G. LOVE: [LAUGHS] That's
like I can't figure out

00:05:37.780 --> 00:05:38.960
what the hell this shit is.

00:05:38.960 --> 00:05:39.668
SPEAKER: Exactly.

00:05:39.668 --> 00:05:42.060
[LAUGHTER]

00:05:42.060 --> 00:05:45.970
Another one, "unique, sloppy,
and laid back, blues sound

00:05:45.970 --> 00:05:47.770
that encompasses classic R&amp;B."

00:05:47.770 --> 00:05:49.300
G. LOVE: [LAUGHS]

00:05:49.300 --> 00:05:50.030
SPEAKER: Right?

00:05:50.030 --> 00:05:52.420
And like, we are in Detroit.

00:05:52.420 --> 00:05:53.110
You know?

00:05:53.110 --> 00:05:55.780
Clearly there's lots
of Motown influence

00:05:55.780 --> 00:05:57.340
as well in some of those songs.

00:05:57.340 --> 00:05:59.724
So how would you describe it?

00:05:59.724 --> 00:06:03.380
G. LOVE: Well, yeah,
we've kind of always--

00:06:03.380 --> 00:06:05.920
we called it hip-hop blues.

00:06:05.920 --> 00:06:08.210
I think that's the kind of--

00:06:08.210 --> 00:06:08.710
it's funny.

00:06:08.710 --> 00:06:10.330
Because people will say,
hey-- you know, I'll

00:06:10.330 --> 00:06:11.730
get in a cab-- oh, you play?

00:06:11.730 --> 00:06:13.110
What kind of music do you play?

00:06:13.110 --> 00:06:14.860
Oh, well, I play hip-hop blues.

00:06:14.860 --> 00:06:17.160
Oh, I love that kind of music.

00:06:17.160 --> 00:06:17.800
Oh, really?

00:06:17.800 --> 00:06:19.508
Because we're the only
people that do it.

00:06:19.508 --> 00:06:22.420
[LAUGHTER] And you don't
know who the hell I am.

00:06:22.420 --> 00:06:25.030
But yeah, I mean,
it's kind of what

00:06:25.030 --> 00:06:29.170
our music of G. Love and
Special Sauce is anyhow.

00:06:29.170 --> 00:06:33.760
The kind of blueprint
for it was I kind of

00:06:33.760 --> 00:06:36.460
learned a lot of
Delta blues, people

00:06:36.460 --> 00:06:41.080
like Robert Johnson
and Bukka White,

00:06:41.080 --> 00:06:44.230
Bob Dylan, too,
and John Hammond.

00:06:44.230 --> 00:06:47.950
And then also I grew
up in the first--

00:06:47.950 --> 00:06:49.060
I'm 44.

00:06:49.060 --> 00:06:51.130
So I look around the room.

00:06:51.130 --> 00:06:52.699
There's probably
some people my age,

00:06:52.699 --> 00:06:54.490
and you know, probably
the first generation

00:06:54.490 --> 00:06:58.750
of kids that kind of
grow up with hip-hop.

00:06:58.750 --> 00:07:02.560
So like I said, I was learning
folk music and then later

00:07:02.560 --> 00:07:06.340
blues music in my room, which
is kind of a solo endeavor.

00:07:06.340 --> 00:07:10.660
But then when I'm out
with my homies, you know,

00:07:10.660 --> 00:07:13.690
we're listening to hip-hop, and
we're running around the city.

00:07:13.690 --> 00:07:19.350
And of course, in
1987 or whatever,

00:07:19.350 --> 00:07:21.026
there was a couple
white rappers.

00:07:21.026 --> 00:07:22.150
There was the Beastie Boys.

00:07:22.150 --> 00:07:22.650
Right?

00:07:22.650 --> 00:07:23.950
They were huge.

00:07:23.950 --> 00:07:27.250
And there was 3rd Bass
and then Vanilla Ice,

00:07:27.250 --> 00:07:31.340
but everybody would
rag on him, you know?

00:07:31.340 --> 00:07:37.420
But yeah, the point is that
the Beastie Boys seemed kind

00:07:37.420 --> 00:07:40.195
of a fluke, and indeed
hip-hop was very--

00:07:43.730 --> 00:07:45.580
it's a black music.

00:07:45.580 --> 00:07:50.170
It's a black art form
from predominately black

00:07:50.170 --> 00:07:51.190
neighborhoods.

00:07:51.190 --> 00:07:56.680
It's a true cultural music
of America, like the same way

00:07:56.680 --> 00:07:58.090
that Delta blues is.

00:07:58.090 --> 00:08:00.740
And I've always found there's
a lot of correlation there.

00:08:00.740 --> 00:08:05.100
But the point of the story
is that you never thought--

00:08:05.100 --> 00:08:08.110
I never thought I
would be a rapper.

00:08:08.110 --> 00:08:10.450
And I don't know
whether I am now,

00:08:10.450 --> 00:08:17.500
but hip-hop is a large part
of our music, and I do rap.

00:08:17.500 --> 00:08:23.800
So those two influences
kind of collided for me

00:08:23.800 --> 00:08:25.660
in a really natural kind of way.

00:08:25.660 --> 00:08:31.960
Because you know, I
was never planning

00:08:31.960 --> 00:08:34.900
on the two of them
colliding, but really my life

00:08:34.900 --> 00:08:38.890
was these-- were these two polar
opposite things, like Peter,

00:08:38.890 --> 00:08:40.960
Paul, and Mary and
the Beastie Boys.

00:08:40.960 --> 00:08:43.240
You know?

00:08:43.240 --> 00:08:47.170
And I never thought
about combining them,

00:08:47.170 --> 00:08:48.490
but eventually they just did.

00:08:48.490 --> 00:08:51.970
Because I became a street
musician, and one night

00:08:51.970 --> 00:08:53.580
when I was out there playing--

00:08:53.580 --> 00:08:56.300
and this was like a great
epiphany of my life.

00:08:56.300 --> 00:08:58.510
I started playing
this blues riff,

00:08:58.510 --> 00:09:00.100
and then I finished the song.

00:09:00.100 --> 00:09:02.510
And then I started rapping
the lyrics for one of Eric B.

00:09:02.510 --> 00:09:06.790
and Rakim songs called "Paid
in Full" over top of it.

00:09:06.790 --> 00:09:08.440
And then at that
moment, it was like,

00:09:08.440 --> 00:09:11.530
you know, it was like
the clouds parted,

00:09:11.530 --> 00:09:14.770
and it was like shining a light
on the street in Philadelphia.

00:09:14.770 --> 00:09:17.800
And I was the only
kid in the world

00:09:17.800 --> 00:09:22.960
at that moment playing a Dobro
acoustic guitar and rapping.

00:09:22.960 --> 00:09:25.389
And I was like, OK,
well, now I got it.

00:09:25.389 --> 00:09:27.430
And that was what you want
to have as a musician.

00:09:27.430 --> 00:09:31.417
You want to find an
original take on something.

00:09:31.417 --> 00:09:34.000
And then I had to explain it--
and that's the thing is that no

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:35.460
one knows what it--

00:09:35.460 --> 00:09:38.130
no one could really
ever put us in a box.

00:09:38.130 --> 00:09:39.130
It wasn't rock and roll.

00:09:39.130 --> 00:09:41.090
It wasn't hip-hop.

00:09:41.090 --> 00:09:45.250
So the record labels,
especially marketing people,

00:09:45.250 --> 00:09:47.950
they want to have an
easy way to put you.

00:09:47.950 --> 00:09:50.680
But they never could
figure out what to call us

00:09:50.680 --> 00:09:51.850
or what section to put us.

00:09:51.850 --> 00:09:53.711
You could go into
one Tower Records,

00:09:53.711 --> 00:09:55.210
and we might be in
hip-hop, and then

00:09:55.210 --> 00:09:56.850
another one would
be alternative rock.

00:09:56.850 --> 00:09:59.510
So that's why we have
a lot of adjectives

00:09:59.510 --> 00:10:02.560
and trying to figure out,
like, what we're doing.

00:10:02.560 --> 00:10:03.910
SPEAKER: And then even with--

00:10:03.910 --> 00:10:07.780
early on you got a decent
rotation at MTV network

00:10:07.780 --> 00:10:11.920
when people were watching it and
when it actually played music.

00:10:11.920 --> 00:10:17.950
Were you considered back
then with MTV hip-hop?

00:10:17.950 --> 00:10:20.710
Because, again, your videos,
especially the older ones,

00:10:20.710 --> 00:10:24.010
I watched them on YouTube, and
they're very black and white,

00:10:24.010 --> 00:10:28.110
very soul and blues
kind of videos.

00:10:28.110 --> 00:10:31.120
So I'm very curious about going
from the 15-year-old who wrote

00:10:31.120 --> 00:10:32.860
the song, to being
a street musician,

00:10:32.860 --> 00:10:38.200
to finding your sound, then
getting on MTV, figuring out--

00:10:38.200 --> 00:10:40.376
when did you have
to stop explaining

00:10:40.376 --> 00:10:42.000
and actually start
playing and touring?

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:42.854
G. LOVE: Never.

00:10:42.854 --> 00:10:44.790
[LAUGHTER] No.

00:10:44.790 --> 00:10:46.900
I mean, it's kind of
an interesting thing

00:10:46.900 --> 00:10:49.660
to talk about,
because, you know,

00:10:49.660 --> 00:10:56.164
when we first came out with
the first record, everything

00:10:56.164 --> 00:10:57.330
changes in your life, right?

00:10:57.330 --> 00:11:01.870
You go from being a
street performer, which

00:11:01.870 --> 00:11:04.810
everybody in my band,
which is a trio,

00:11:04.810 --> 00:11:08.630
started as a street performer
in Boston or Philadelphia.

00:11:08.630 --> 00:11:11.170
And so you think about,
like, you're really

00:11:11.170 --> 00:11:13.090
living on the fringe
of society, right?

00:11:13.090 --> 00:11:16.690
So you're kind of very far
away from corporate America.

00:11:16.690 --> 00:11:19.330
You're very far away
from making any money.

00:11:19.330 --> 00:11:24.117
You're 100 light years away
from the record labels,

00:11:24.117 --> 00:11:26.200
which are really just a
couple hours down the road

00:11:26.200 --> 00:11:28.930
in New York City.

00:11:28.930 --> 00:11:34.240
You're a million miles away
from MTV and all the real music

00:11:34.240 --> 00:11:38.710
that you see every day on that.

00:11:38.710 --> 00:11:41.680
And holy shit-- then all of
a sudden you send your demo,

00:11:41.680 --> 00:11:43.489
and then you have the
opportunity to play.

00:11:43.489 --> 00:11:45.280
And then they liked
it, and then now you're

00:11:45.280 --> 00:11:47.290
getting a record deal.

00:11:47.290 --> 00:11:52.870
And all of a sudden you
went from not having a job,

00:11:52.870 --> 00:11:54.790
except for playing as
a street performer,

00:11:54.790 --> 00:11:58.930
to now working for Sony Music
and having a pocketful of money

00:11:58.930 --> 00:12:01.330
but working for one of
the biggest corporations,

00:12:01.330 --> 00:12:04.180
not only in America,
but in the world, right?

00:12:04.180 --> 00:12:07.750
So, like, for us it
was like overnight life

00:12:07.750 --> 00:12:10.030
changed completely.

00:12:10.030 --> 00:12:12.610
And along with that, then
all of a sudden people

00:12:12.610 --> 00:12:15.840
want to know, well,
why are you here?

00:12:15.840 --> 00:12:17.530
What gives you the
right to be here?

00:12:17.530 --> 00:12:18.130
Right?

00:12:18.130 --> 00:12:20.170
What's this music that
you're playing all about?

00:12:20.170 --> 00:12:21.910
I don't know what this is.

00:12:21.910 --> 00:12:24.190
Explain it to us.

00:12:24.190 --> 00:12:26.710
And then, of course,
for us, being

00:12:26.710 --> 00:12:29.770
like a white kid from
Philadelphia in the 80s, like,

00:12:29.770 --> 00:12:33.640
what gives you the right
to play blues music?

00:12:33.640 --> 00:12:35.590
And what gives you the
right to play hip-hop?

00:12:35.590 --> 00:12:41.410
Because clearly you're
not built for that.

00:12:41.410 --> 00:12:48.211
And that was like a really big
thing in my early 20s was--

00:12:48.211 --> 00:12:49.960
whether you're, like,
defending your right

00:12:49.960 --> 00:12:53.152
to play this type of
music or explaining

00:12:53.152 --> 00:12:55.110
why you came about doing
it in the first place.

00:12:55.110 --> 00:12:56.950
It was never
comfortable, you know?

00:12:56.950 --> 00:13:00.970
And especially when you go over
to Europe or you go to Japan,

00:13:00.970 --> 00:13:03.100
then they really
hone in on this.

00:13:05.800 --> 00:13:12.840
And so that was an interesting
thing to kind of juggle,

00:13:12.840 --> 00:13:16.480
you know, mentally
and emotionally.

00:13:16.480 --> 00:13:19.570
What gives you the right
to play this music?

00:13:19.570 --> 00:13:21.730
And then, of course,
you meet the artist--

00:13:21.730 --> 00:13:23.470
because we've toured
with everybody

00:13:23.470 --> 00:13:31.660
from Buddy Guy, who signed
my guitar here, to Run DMC,

00:13:31.660 --> 00:13:35.890
and everybody you can
imagine, you know, A Tribe

00:13:35.890 --> 00:13:38.204
Called Quest, and Gang Starr.

00:13:38.204 --> 00:13:39.370
SPEAKER: Dave Matthews Band.

00:13:39.370 --> 00:13:41.800
G. LOVE: Dave Matthews Band.

00:13:41.800 --> 00:13:44.470
But I was really talking
about like the hip-hop people,

00:13:44.470 --> 00:13:48.760
because these people, these
artists, they would never say,

00:13:48.760 --> 00:13:50.770
like, you know, why
are you doing this?

00:13:50.770 --> 00:13:52.510
Well, of course,
they knew right away.

00:13:52.510 --> 00:13:55.300
They could tell, you know,
whatever we're doing,

00:13:55.300 --> 00:13:56.660
this is what they do.

00:13:56.660 --> 00:13:57.310
Right?

00:13:57.310 --> 00:13:59.800
You do it because
you have to do it.

00:13:59.800 --> 00:14:02.740
And so the artists were
always very supportive,

00:14:02.740 --> 00:14:04.660
which was nice.

00:14:04.660 --> 00:14:06.910
You know, Q-Tip would never
say, yo, G., you're white.

00:14:06.910 --> 00:14:07.970
Why are you rapping?

00:14:07.970 --> 00:14:09.490
He was like, yeah,
man, I'm a fan.

00:14:09.490 --> 00:14:10.450
You know?

00:14:10.450 --> 00:14:14.110
And I was like, oh, my god.

00:14:14.110 --> 00:14:15.330
So yeah.

00:14:15.330 --> 00:14:16.800
SPEAKER: So your early 20s--

00:14:16.800 --> 00:14:18.640
G. LOVE: I don't know if I
answered any of your questions

00:14:18.640 --> 00:14:19.140
or anything.

00:14:19.140 --> 00:14:20.065
[LAUGHTER]

00:14:20.065 --> 00:14:21.015
SPEAKER: I don't know
about the questions,

00:14:21.015 --> 00:14:22.325
but the answers are great.

00:14:22.325 --> 00:14:23.740
This is good.

00:14:23.740 --> 00:14:27.640
So you know, early 20s,
you make it a little bit.

00:14:27.640 --> 00:14:28.600
You get on MTV.

00:14:28.600 --> 00:14:30.320
You tour a lot.

00:14:30.320 --> 00:14:33.520
Then you guys decide to,
or choose to, or end up

00:14:33.520 --> 00:14:35.182
taking a fairly long break.

00:14:35.182 --> 00:14:37.390
And then right now-- because
you mentioned it, right?

00:14:37.390 --> 00:14:38.770
Right now you're in your 40s.

00:14:38.770 --> 00:14:41.196
You're back with a new
album, back on the road.

00:14:41.196 --> 00:14:42.820
I'm just kind of
curious mentally-- how

00:14:42.820 --> 00:14:45.100
are you approaching your
touring times right now

00:14:45.100 --> 00:14:46.935
versus what you were
doing in the past?

00:14:46.935 --> 00:14:49.900
G. LOVE: Oh, I like to think
that we finally figured out

00:14:49.900 --> 00:14:51.590
this whole thing now.

00:14:51.590 --> 00:14:52.610
You know what I mean?

00:14:52.610 --> 00:14:56.905
Because there's
definitely-- god.

00:14:56.905 --> 00:15:00.290
The music business has changed,
and it's always changing.

00:15:00.290 --> 00:15:00.790
You know?

00:15:03.640 --> 00:15:05.680
Certainly because
technology and you

00:15:05.680 --> 00:15:11.380
know things that you guys
are involved in for sure.

00:15:11.380 --> 00:15:18.240
And you know, basically I
got signed when I was 20,

00:15:18.240 --> 00:15:21.820
so I really didn't know
anything about anything other

00:15:21.820 --> 00:15:23.320
than playing music.

00:15:23.320 --> 00:15:27.130
And it was a big learning curve.

00:15:27.130 --> 00:15:29.560
I definitely made a lot
of mistakes along the way,

00:15:29.560 --> 00:15:31.810
trying to figure out how to
navigate through the music

00:15:31.810 --> 00:15:32.500
business.

00:15:32.500 --> 00:15:34.640
And like I said,
that's always changing.

00:15:34.640 --> 00:15:39.430
So how do I approach
touring now differently?

00:15:39.430 --> 00:15:44.610
You know, we have a saying
that's called back in the van

00:15:44.610 --> 00:15:45.190
again.

00:15:45.190 --> 00:15:45.690
Right?

00:15:45.690 --> 00:15:47.898
Because you spend a lot of
time when you're coming up

00:15:47.898 --> 00:15:49.290
riding around in a van.

00:15:49.290 --> 00:15:54.180
And you know the 12-passenger
vans that you rent from Budget,

00:15:54.180 --> 00:16:00.030
like the Ford 150, 12
passenger, white van.

00:16:00.030 --> 00:16:02.500
You don't want to get
back in the van again.

00:16:02.500 --> 00:16:03.000
Right?

00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:04.650
So that's how you
approach a tour.

00:16:04.650 --> 00:16:06.810
We're not-- we're
going to do whatever

00:16:06.810 --> 00:16:08.950
we have to do to not
be back in the van.

00:16:08.950 --> 00:16:09.450
Right?

00:16:09.450 --> 00:16:13.230
Meaning, we want-- we've got a
tour bus, so traveling in a van

00:16:13.230 --> 00:16:15.540
is pretty tough.

00:16:15.540 --> 00:16:19.491
It's great if you're like
22 years old and don't--

00:16:19.491 --> 00:16:19.990
that's cool.

00:16:19.990 --> 00:16:23.000
But when you're like
in your 40s, which--

00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:24.720
well, actually,
I'm the only person

00:16:24.720 --> 00:16:26.430
in my band left in their 40s.

00:16:26.430 --> 00:16:29.310
My drummer and bass player
are now in their 50s.

00:16:29.310 --> 00:16:34.120
So we approach touring
like a small business.

00:16:34.120 --> 00:16:37.350
So that's kind of what
we've always been.

00:16:37.350 --> 00:16:40.890
Once we figured out, OK,
aside from the music,

00:16:40.890 --> 00:16:42.810
this is a small business.

00:16:42.810 --> 00:16:45.590
Because we've never
really had like--

00:16:45.590 --> 00:16:48.570
even though we got signed
and had that success which

00:16:48.570 --> 00:16:51.270
seemed overnight,
really all that did

00:16:51.270 --> 00:16:54.600
was basically like you've got
a record deal that basically

00:16:54.600 --> 00:16:56.160
is like a small business loan.

00:16:56.160 --> 00:16:57.480
Right?

00:16:57.480 --> 00:17:02.730
And then that set us on the
way to keeping our business up,

00:17:02.730 --> 00:17:07.710
and our store is what we set up
on stage every night to sell,

00:17:07.710 --> 00:17:08.800
like a pop-up shop.

00:17:08.800 --> 00:17:09.300
You know?

00:17:09.300 --> 00:17:14.300
So I think we approach
our touring like that,

00:17:14.300 --> 00:17:17.069
like on the business side.

00:17:17.069 --> 00:17:17.960
That's how we run it.

00:17:17.960 --> 00:17:19.240
It's pretty grassroots.

00:17:19.240 --> 00:17:21.670
You know, we have
a small business.

00:17:21.670 --> 00:17:26.670
There's two people in the
front office in New York,

00:17:26.670 --> 00:17:29.820
and there's six of us on the
road, including band and crew.

00:17:29.820 --> 00:17:32.760
And then we have, you know,
an accountant and lawyer,

00:17:32.760 --> 00:17:34.220
and they're kind of independent.

00:17:37.140 --> 00:17:42.820
But yeah, you got to look at
the road as being a marathon

00:17:42.820 --> 00:17:44.150
not a sprint.

00:17:44.150 --> 00:17:45.720
And one thing that I--

00:17:45.720 --> 00:17:48.720
one thing that I have kind
of realized along the way

00:17:48.720 --> 00:17:51.380
is that you're basically
rowing around in circles.

00:17:51.380 --> 00:17:57.060
So the world is so big you
can't get to every place you

00:17:57.060 --> 00:17:59.220
want to get to every year.

00:17:59.220 --> 00:18:02.210
So it's best to take your time.

00:18:02.210 --> 00:18:03.600
It's a marathon.

00:18:03.600 --> 00:18:06.235
SPEAKER: Well, and one thing
I didn't know about you,

00:18:06.235 --> 00:18:07.860
which I thought was
really interesting,

00:18:07.860 --> 00:18:09.900
the children's book
that you wrote.

00:18:09.900 --> 00:18:11.760
So you know, "Little Daddies--

00:18:11.760 --> 00:18:14.100
A Book for Kids with
Traveling Dads."

00:18:14.100 --> 00:18:17.903
Clearly being for so long away
from home and having-- you

00:18:17.903 --> 00:18:19.580
said your kid right now is 15?

00:18:19.580 --> 00:18:20.780
G. LOVE: Yeah.

00:18:20.780 --> 00:18:22.860
SPEAKER: So, I
mean, I have kids.

00:18:22.860 --> 00:18:24.900
Many of us have
both families and we

00:18:24.900 --> 00:18:26.120
travel for different reasons.

00:18:26.120 --> 00:18:26.953
It's very different.

00:18:26.953 --> 00:18:28.590
But I would love to
just kind of hear

00:18:28.590 --> 00:18:31.160
from you what got you
to write this song.

00:18:31.160 --> 00:18:32.400
What was the experience?

00:18:32.400 --> 00:18:36.900
And did it impact you and
your son and the relationship

00:18:36.900 --> 00:18:39.552
that you have had that
you have right now?

00:18:39.552 --> 00:18:41.010
G. LOVE: Yeah, you
know, actually I

00:18:41.010 --> 00:18:44.140
have a 15-year-old boy, and
I have a 10-month-old boy.

00:18:44.140 --> 00:18:47.035
So, you know, whoops.

00:18:47.035 --> 00:18:48.380
[LAUGHTER]

00:18:53.520 --> 00:18:56.920
But fatherhood has been
the best thing for my life.

00:18:59.880 --> 00:19:02.464
You never think it's going
to happen, but then it does.

00:19:02.464 --> 00:19:03.880
It's like the
greatest thing ever.

00:19:03.880 --> 00:19:07.900
So I'm not really great
at planning things.

00:19:07.900 --> 00:19:11.700
But you know,
certainly being a dad

00:19:11.700 --> 00:19:16.210
has been the greatest
gift of my life.

00:19:16.210 --> 00:19:20.000
And so one thing is that
if you guys travel a lot,

00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:21.480
like everybody
travels these days,

00:19:21.480 --> 00:19:25.920
so it never gets comfortable or
easy to leave your kid at home,

00:19:25.920 --> 00:19:29.940
really no matter
how old they are.

00:19:29.940 --> 00:19:32.610
Like I said, my
older son is 15 now,

00:19:32.610 --> 00:19:34.500
and he's a full-on teenager.

00:19:34.500 --> 00:19:37.380
And every time I drop him
off, I'm like, (WEAKLY) bye,

00:19:37.380 --> 00:19:38.300
I got to go.

00:19:38.300 --> 00:19:40.410
See you in a couple weeks.

00:19:40.410 --> 00:19:41.930
You know?

00:19:41.930 --> 00:19:43.760
It never gets easy
to say goodbye.

00:19:43.760 --> 00:19:46.230
And I think it's almost
easier for the kids

00:19:46.230 --> 00:19:49.080
than it is for the parents,
because you feel, like,

00:19:49.080 --> 00:19:53.470
so much guilt. And oh,
my god, I'm leaving.

00:19:53.470 --> 00:19:56.700
So anyhow, when my
older son was a toddler,

00:19:56.700 --> 00:19:58.830
I would say, OK, where's
daddy going to be?

00:19:58.830 --> 00:20:00.520
And then he would
point to his heart.

00:20:00.520 --> 00:20:01.840
And then I'd say, OK,
where's Aiden going to be?

00:20:01.840 --> 00:20:03.250
And he'd point at my heart.

00:20:03.250 --> 00:20:06.870
And we'd say we always keep each
other in each other's hearts.

00:20:06.870 --> 00:20:09.714
And that was the
premise of this book,

00:20:09.714 --> 00:20:11.130
this book called
"Little Daddies--

00:20:11.130 --> 00:20:13.500
A Book for Kids with
Traveling Dads."

00:20:17.230 --> 00:20:19.420
It's on Amazon.

00:20:19.420 --> 00:20:22.490
They print it up there.

00:20:22.490 --> 00:20:26.060
You can Google it and find it.

00:20:28.660 --> 00:20:30.582
And then hopefully
it'll sell enough copies

00:20:30.582 --> 00:20:32.540
so that I can write
"Little Mommies," you know,

00:20:32.540 --> 00:20:35.020
the book for kids
with traveling moms.

00:20:35.020 --> 00:20:36.970
You know, one thing at a time.

00:20:36.970 --> 00:20:39.890
But, you know, that's been good.

00:20:39.890 --> 00:20:44.030
My older son, actually, his
step-dad is a musician as well.

00:20:47.024 --> 00:20:48.440
So I couldn't quite
figure out why

00:20:48.440 --> 00:20:53.030
his mother went with
him because she was so

00:20:53.030 --> 00:20:55.070
aggravated with what I did.

00:20:55.070 --> 00:20:56.990
She, of course, went
with another musician.

00:20:56.990 --> 00:21:00.350
But we're great
friends, all of us.

00:21:00.350 --> 00:21:06.080
And you know, I don't know.

00:21:06.080 --> 00:21:08.360
It is a juggle, though,
traveling so much.

00:21:08.360 --> 00:21:13.490
Because I probably do
travel like 250 days a year.

00:21:13.490 --> 00:21:16.340
I don't do 250
shows, but I think

00:21:16.340 --> 00:21:18.740
that's about how much
we're away from home.

00:21:18.740 --> 00:21:21.380
I figured out-- I think it's
like every time I spend a night

00:21:21.380 --> 00:21:23.990
at home, it costs
me like $1,000--

00:21:23.990 --> 00:21:26.420
it's like $1,000 hotel room.

00:21:26.420 --> 00:21:29.240
You know, that's how many--
like if I'm home for--

00:21:29.240 --> 00:21:34.340
if my mortgage is $4,000,
I'm home four nights a month.

00:21:34.340 --> 00:21:35.520
You know what I mean?

00:21:35.520 --> 00:21:37.965
It's like, damn, this
is an expensive hotel.

00:21:37.965 --> 00:21:39.300
This place is so expensive.

00:21:39.300 --> 00:21:46.850
[LAUGHS] But yeah, you
know, it is something.

00:21:46.850 --> 00:21:50.630
It's tough to be away.

00:21:50.630 --> 00:21:52.580
Like they say, you
never get the time back.

00:21:52.580 --> 00:21:57.200
And that's something that I
think now that my son is 15,

00:21:57.200 --> 00:22:01.190
he's a sophomore, I can see him
already walking out the door.

00:22:01.190 --> 00:22:04.910
And I'm just like, oh, you
know, I have a lot of emotions.

00:22:04.910 --> 00:22:11.420
Like, man, you know, you
never get that time back.

00:22:11.420 --> 00:22:14.180
I don't know what to
say other than that.

00:22:14.180 --> 00:22:17.470
That part of it is a
tough part of the job.

00:22:17.470 --> 00:22:19.610
SPEAKER: I have a
couple more questions.

00:22:19.610 --> 00:22:21.760
I want to make sure that
we leave time for you

00:22:21.760 --> 00:22:25.050
guys for Q&amp;A. All right,
before we go into the "Love

00:22:25.050 --> 00:22:30.440
Saves the Day," you did
a couple of commercials--

00:22:30.440 --> 00:22:32.210
Coke, Cadillac.

00:22:32.210 --> 00:22:35.800
You are on YouTube right
now, having actually like

00:22:35.800 --> 00:22:38.300
1.2, 1.3 million views for
some of your kind of older

00:22:38.300 --> 00:22:39.360
songs, good stuff.

00:22:39.360 --> 00:22:42.410
I know many of the artists,
many of the musicians,

00:22:42.410 --> 00:22:44.762
they look at social media.

00:22:44.762 --> 00:22:46.220
They look at some
of those things--

00:22:46.220 --> 00:22:50.270
Spotify, YouTube, being in
commercials as being something

00:22:50.270 --> 00:22:52.310
they hate doing or
they have to do,

00:22:52.310 --> 00:22:53.686
versus others just embrace it.

00:22:53.686 --> 00:22:56.060
Now, the whole idea of you as
a musician making money off

00:22:56.060 --> 00:23:01.290
of album sales I think is kind
of gone back into history.

00:23:01.290 --> 00:23:04.020
So I'm curious from you--

00:23:04.020 --> 00:23:07.910
I love the analogy of small
business, a pop-up shop.

00:23:07.910 --> 00:23:10.580
How are you thinking
of digital--

00:23:10.580 --> 00:23:12.974
YouTube, Spotify, social media?

00:23:12.974 --> 00:23:15.140
What does it mean for you
as being a musician that's

00:23:15.140 --> 00:23:17.570
on the road 250 days a year?

00:23:17.570 --> 00:23:21.950
G. LOVE: Well, I think
now, like in the past year

00:23:21.950 --> 00:23:24.634
or whatever, just
very recently, they're

00:23:24.634 --> 00:23:26.050
finally starting
to figure it out,

00:23:26.050 --> 00:23:28.070
and there's a lot
more transparency

00:23:28.070 --> 00:23:29.630
in the digital music thing.

00:23:29.630 --> 00:23:33.920
So you know, that's one
thing about my career.

00:23:33.920 --> 00:23:35.540
I've really seen--

00:23:35.540 --> 00:23:39.740
I got signed kind of five
years before the very peak

00:23:39.740 --> 00:23:40.590
of the industry.

00:23:40.590 --> 00:23:42.200
So if you look at it like--

00:23:42.200 --> 00:23:44.390
I think it was like
1999 or something

00:23:44.390 --> 00:23:46.700
when N'Sync put
out a huge record,

00:23:46.700 --> 00:23:51.480
and it was like the
most records sold ever.

00:23:51.480 --> 00:23:53.090
You know?

00:23:53.090 --> 00:23:55.190
Like way more than
the Beatles ever sold

00:23:55.190 --> 00:23:57.110
in like a day or something.

00:23:57.110 --> 00:24:00.710
If you look at that as like the
peak of the commercialization

00:24:00.710 --> 00:24:03.710
of the success of the
music industry, then

00:24:03.710 --> 00:24:09.770
after that Napster came
along, then there was 9/11.

00:24:09.770 --> 00:24:13.370
And it all hit at the same time.

00:24:13.370 --> 00:24:17.480
And just to put it
in perspective, like,

00:24:17.480 --> 00:24:25.070
in October of 2001, like
less than a month after 9/11,

00:24:25.070 --> 00:24:27.490
we got a call from our A&amp;R guy.

00:24:27.490 --> 00:24:30.980
And you know, I just
happened to be in the office,

00:24:30.980 --> 00:24:33.060
and I said, oh, hey, Mike.

00:24:33.060 --> 00:24:34.452
How Are you calling to drop us?

00:24:34.452 --> 00:24:36.910
And he goes-- and I was just
joking, but I kind of knew it.

00:24:36.910 --> 00:24:39.292
And he was like, actually, yeah.

00:24:39.292 --> 00:24:41.750
I'm calling to-- you know, it's
been a great run, you know?

00:24:41.750 --> 00:24:42.960
Love ya.

00:24:42.960 --> 00:24:45.660
That was last time I
ever talked to him.

00:24:45.660 --> 00:24:49.647
And so between 9/11 and
Napster, the music industry

00:24:49.647 --> 00:24:50.480
really shit the bed.

00:24:50.480 --> 00:24:56.030
And then for the last almost
20 years between that, now

00:24:56.030 --> 00:24:58.280
it's been kind of trying
to figure itself out.

00:24:58.280 --> 00:25:02.960
And now with Spotify and
different streaming services,

00:25:02.960 --> 00:25:04.730
like I said, there's
more transparency.

00:25:04.730 --> 00:25:06.230
And now the artists
and the labels

00:25:06.230 --> 00:25:08.600
are starting to get
paid from the streaming.

00:25:08.600 --> 00:25:13.520
And because the consumer
likes the streaming,

00:25:13.520 --> 00:25:16.460
now you don't hear about people
like pirating or stealing

00:25:16.460 --> 00:25:17.030
music, right?

00:25:17.030 --> 00:25:19.310
Because everyone
gets it for free now

00:25:19.310 --> 00:25:21.980
or with a small
subscription fee, and that

00:25:21.980 --> 00:25:23.580
works out for everybody.

00:25:23.580 --> 00:25:27.800
So now you have a chance to make
money off it, which is good.

00:25:27.800 --> 00:25:30.140
Because if the record
labels can make money,

00:25:30.140 --> 00:25:32.330
then they can give
budgets to people like us

00:25:32.330 --> 00:25:36.627
to make music because
it does cost--

00:25:36.627 --> 00:25:38.210
it does cost a certain
amount of money

00:25:38.210 --> 00:25:40.880
to make a high quality record.

00:25:40.880 --> 00:25:42.950
You have to pay musicians.

00:25:42.950 --> 00:25:45.670
You have to pay for studio
time and everything else.

00:25:45.670 --> 00:25:50.000
So I see now--

00:25:50.000 --> 00:25:53.640
now we see, like, good things
starting to happen again.

00:25:53.640 --> 00:25:57.730
And so I feel better
about the music business.

00:25:57.730 --> 00:26:00.605
SPEAKER: Was it-- the Cadillac.

00:26:00.605 --> 00:26:02.480
Cadillac actually had
a pretty heavy rotation

00:26:02.480 --> 00:26:03.290
of the commercial.

00:26:03.290 --> 00:26:03.950
G. LOVE: Oh, yeah.

00:26:03.950 --> 00:26:05.491
SPEAKER: They used
some of your song.

00:26:05.491 --> 00:26:06.430
Was it pretty cool?

00:26:06.430 --> 00:26:08.990
Did people text you just like,
hey, I just heard your song

00:26:08.990 --> 00:26:09.887
in the commercial?

00:26:09.887 --> 00:26:10.470
G. LOVE: Yeah.

00:26:10.470 --> 00:26:12.986
Actually, so back
to the commercials--

00:26:12.986 --> 00:26:14.360
the whole thing
about commercials

00:26:14.360 --> 00:26:17.360
was that commercials--
and if you're a musician,

00:26:17.360 --> 00:26:19.010
if you had a chance
to do a commercial,

00:26:19.010 --> 00:26:21.230
it was really a sellout move.

00:26:21.230 --> 00:26:23.540
That was the way our
generation perceived it.

00:26:23.540 --> 00:26:24.830
Right?

00:26:24.830 --> 00:26:30.320
And to me, that ended when there
was two major commercials--

00:26:30.320 --> 00:26:32.600
I don't know if you
remember-- but when

00:26:32.600 --> 00:26:36.505
the Beatles' "Revolution"
was in a Nike commercial.

00:26:36.505 --> 00:26:38.630
And then I think there was
a Led Zeppelin song that

00:26:38.630 --> 00:26:40.240
was used in a commercial.

00:26:40.240 --> 00:26:44.090
And then Bob Dylan was
physically in a Victoria's

00:26:44.090 --> 00:26:45.885
Secret commercial.

00:26:45.885 --> 00:26:47.260
Do you guys remember
that at all?

00:26:47.260 --> 00:26:50.670
It was like the weirdest
like-- it was like a Victoria's

00:26:50.670 --> 00:26:52.253
Secret commercial,
and all of a sudden

00:26:52.253 --> 00:26:54.305
there was Bob Dylan
just sitting there.

00:26:54.305 --> 00:26:56.620
And you're like, what
the-- what is this?

00:26:56.620 --> 00:27:02.420
You're like, OK, man, well,
now it's all open season.

00:27:02.420 --> 00:27:06.200
And yeah, I'd
certainly like to--

00:27:06.200 --> 00:27:13.280
if you're me, you pray to God
that sometime during the year

00:27:13.280 --> 00:27:16.700
you're going to get that
call where, oh, Google

00:27:16.700 --> 00:27:21.414
wants to use this song, an
old song, or a new song,

00:27:21.414 --> 00:27:23.330
or they want you to write
a song, or whatever.

00:27:23.330 --> 00:27:26.060
It's, yes, we want to do it.

00:27:26.060 --> 00:27:34.190
Because for us, it's like
money that you don't expect,

00:27:34.190 --> 00:27:37.430
and on top of that,
more importantly,

00:27:37.430 --> 00:27:39.890
in this day and age I
feel like it's so hard

00:27:39.890 --> 00:27:41.640
to make a splash anywhere.

00:27:41.640 --> 00:27:44.450
There's so many outlets where
people are getting everything

00:27:44.450 --> 00:27:47.120
from you can't have--

00:27:47.120 --> 00:27:49.500
you can't achieve
maximum exposure.

00:27:49.500 --> 00:27:52.890
So every time you get a
song played on anything

00:27:52.890 --> 00:27:53.810
it's like a win.

00:27:53.810 --> 00:27:57.080
So us now, it's like--

00:27:57.080 --> 00:27:59.450
whereas before it would be
a real emotional struggle.

00:27:59.450 --> 00:28:01.610
Oh, my god, well,
Coca-Cola wants

00:28:01.610 --> 00:28:05.150
to give us more money than
we've ever made on anything,

00:28:05.150 --> 00:28:07.970
but now, look, we could
lose all our fanbase.

00:28:07.970 --> 00:28:09.800
This is a real problem.

00:28:09.800 --> 00:28:15.500
We could take this money from
Coca-Cola or Philip Morris.

00:28:18.410 --> 00:28:20.690
But, god, if we do
this, we're going

00:28:20.690 --> 00:28:23.940
to upset our fans and
the rock and roll gods.

00:28:23.940 --> 00:28:26.860
I remember, I really did have--

00:28:26.860 --> 00:28:28.820
and we passed a lot of stuff.

00:28:28.820 --> 00:28:32.630
We left a lot of money on
the table for this reason.

00:28:32.630 --> 00:28:36.020
We left a huge Miller Light
commercial on the table.

00:28:36.020 --> 00:28:38.840
It was definitely like
a three figure deal,

00:28:38.840 --> 00:28:41.750
and it was probably like,
well, no, that's a sellout.

00:28:41.750 --> 00:28:43.100
We can't do that.

00:28:43.100 --> 00:28:46.220
Or TGIF Friday's wants to
use your song "Baby's Got

00:28:46.220 --> 00:28:50.460
Sauce" in a rib
commercial in the UK only.

00:28:50.460 --> 00:28:53.180
No, can't do that.

00:28:53.180 --> 00:28:56.720
Philip Morris wants to use
your song "Cold Beverage"

00:28:56.720 --> 00:28:59.510
in Eastern Europe only.

00:28:59.510 --> 00:29:01.340
And I said, well, tell
them they can use it

00:29:01.340 --> 00:29:03.830
if they give me $1 million.

00:29:03.830 --> 00:29:05.881
Well, they never
replied, you know?

00:29:05.881 --> 00:29:07.880
I was just basically
saying, you know, fuck you.

00:29:07.880 --> 00:29:08.671
I'm not doing that.

00:29:08.671 --> 00:29:09.650
You know what I mean?

00:29:09.650 --> 00:29:12.350
And now you think
back, you're like,

00:29:12.350 --> 00:29:13.992
damn, I should've taken that.

00:29:13.992 --> 00:29:16.890
[LAUGHTER]

00:29:16.890 --> 00:29:19.664
SPEAKER: So "Loves Saves
the Day," your newest album.

00:29:19.664 --> 00:29:21.080
First of all, where
do you record?

00:29:21.080 --> 00:29:23.420
In Philly or do you go
somewhere else to record it?

00:29:23.420 --> 00:29:26.330
G. LOVE: We recorded the
latest record and actually

00:29:26.330 --> 00:29:30.080
our last couple records
in Brushfire Studios,

00:29:30.080 --> 00:29:35.284
which is Jack Johnson's record
label and studio in Hollywood.

00:29:35.284 --> 00:29:35.783
SPEAKER: OK.

00:29:35.783 --> 00:29:36.590
Cool.

00:29:36.590 --> 00:29:40.540
So how is this one different
from some of the other work?

00:29:40.540 --> 00:29:47.750
G. LOVE: Well, I mean, this
record for us was kind of--

00:29:47.750 --> 00:29:50.390
records kind of flow, and
the music is always flowing,

00:29:50.390 --> 00:29:53.130
and one thing leads to another.

00:29:53.130 --> 00:29:56.340
So our previous record
was called "Sugar,"

00:29:56.340 --> 00:30:00.650
and I felt like we kind of
stumbled upon the modern day

00:30:00.650 --> 00:30:02.870
version of the
hip-hop blues, which

00:30:02.870 --> 00:30:04.250
was very clear cut this time.

00:30:04.250 --> 00:30:06.110
It was like Cypress
Hill style beats

00:30:06.110 --> 00:30:09.170
with Elmore James style guitar.

00:30:09.170 --> 00:30:11.060
Right?

00:30:11.060 --> 00:30:13.202
So it was like, OK,
and that was the song

00:30:13.202 --> 00:30:15.410
actually they used in that
Cadillac commercial called

00:30:15.410 --> 00:30:16.910
"Come Up Man."

00:30:16.910 --> 00:30:20.090
Anyways, I felt like, OK,
now we got a really concrete

00:30:20.090 --> 00:30:23.750
blueprint, and we're going to
really push it on this record.

00:30:23.750 --> 00:30:29.840
So we really pushed
that sound, and then it

00:30:29.840 --> 00:30:31.460
ended up being rock and roll.

00:30:31.460 --> 00:30:34.257
Because basically if you
push the blues enough,

00:30:34.257 --> 00:30:35.840
it ends up being
rock and roll, right?

00:30:35.840 --> 00:30:37.423
That's how rock and
roll was invented.

00:30:37.423 --> 00:30:39.874
So we finally, after 25
years, figured out how

00:30:39.874 --> 00:30:40.790
to play rock and roll.

00:30:40.790 --> 00:30:45.020
[LAUGHTER]

00:30:45.020 --> 00:30:47.690
SPEAKER: All right,
let's transition to some

00:30:47.690 --> 00:30:48.680
of the questions, Q&amp;As.

00:30:48.680 --> 00:30:50.854
So again, raise your
hand and wait for a mic.

00:30:50.854 --> 00:30:52.520
G. LOVE: Someone
please have a question.

00:30:52.520 --> 00:30:55.352
[LAUGHS]

00:30:59.409 --> 00:30:59.950
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:30:59.950 --> 00:31:02.229
I'm Laura-- long,
long, long time fan.

00:31:02.229 --> 00:31:03.020
G. LOVE: Thank you.

00:31:03.020 --> 00:31:05.667
AUDIENCE: Thank
you for being here.

00:31:05.667 --> 00:31:07.250
We were talking
earlier actually today

00:31:07.250 --> 00:31:10.100
about a couple of our
favorite live performers

00:31:10.100 --> 00:31:14.270
and how it is so different to
see them in different cities

00:31:14.270 --> 00:31:16.340
and at different
venues, and how they

00:31:16.340 --> 00:31:21.280
can kind of vibe off of the
city or even the venue itself.

00:31:21.280 --> 00:31:23.690
So outside of your
roots in Philly--

00:31:23.690 --> 00:31:26.450
because it wouldn't be
fair to include that--

00:31:26.450 --> 00:31:29.300
do you have a favorite venue or
a favorite city to perform in?

00:31:29.300 --> 00:31:31.470
And you don't have to
say Detroit, either.

00:31:31.470 --> 00:31:32.290
G. LOVE: Detroit!

00:31:32.290 --> 00:31:33.786
The MGM Grand tonight.

00:31:33.786 --> 00:31:36.430
[LAUGHTER]

00:31:36.430 --> 00:31:39.630
No, that's a good question.

00:31:39.630 --> 00:31:42.650
I mean, really,
short answer is no,

00:31:42.650 --> 00:31:45.800
because I really do like to--

00:31:45.800 --> 00:31:48.390
every night you're in a
chance-- and like you said,

00:31:48.390 --> 00:31:50.750
you have a room full of people.

00:31:50.750 --> 00:31:52.940
It's a different room,
different crowd. .

00:31:52.940 --> 00:31:55.610
You have a chance to vibe with
them and connect with them

00:31:55.610 --> 00:31:58.070
and make something happen,
like, with your guitar

00:31:58.070 --> 00:32:01.610
and a microphone.

00:32:01.610 --> 00:32:03.800
And to me, a great
experience can

00:32:03.800 --> 00:32:07.700
happen at like a really
prestigious club,

00:32:07.700 --> 00:32:09.770
like The Fillmore
in San Francisco,

00:32:09.770 --> 00:32:13.290
or it can happen at the
corner bar, you know?

00:32:13.290 --> 00:32:14.650
And it often does.

00:32:14.650 --> 00:32:18.950
And honestly, sometimes a lot
of the bigger famous rooms,

00:32:18.950 --> 00:32:20.450
like Red Rocks, for instance.

00:32:20.450 --> 00:32:22.430
You know, if you were
going to say like--

00:32:22.430 --> 00:32:24.980
if you were going to say,
what are the best venues?

00:32:24.980 --> 00:32:28.520
Well, then you have to say
like Red Rocks, or The Gorge

00:32:28.520 --> 00:32:32.450
in Washington, which is on the
banks of the Columbia River

00:32:32.450 --> 00:32:33.290
Canyon.

00:32:33.290 --> 00:32:36.960
The sun goes down, and then the
moon rises behind the stage,

00:32:36.960 --> 00:32:41.980
and it's really a beautiful
place to see or play.

00:32:41.980 --> 00:32:44.270
But like Red Rocks
is one of these rooms

00:32:44.270 --> 00:32:45.860
where I feel like every time--

00:32:45.860 --> 00:32:48.500
I've had the opportunity
to headline it twice.

00:32:48.500 --> 00:32:50.930
And I feel like it's really
kicked my ass every time.

00:32:50.930 --> 00:32:54.497
It's like, you know,
you're backstage,

00:32:54.497 --> 00:32:55.580
and you're walking around.

00:32:55.580 --> 00:32:57.413
You're looking at all
the pictures of people

00:32:57.413 --> 00:32:59.060
who played there like.

00:32:59.060 --> 00:33:01.280
You grew up-- like there's
the Beatles played there,

00:33:01.280 --> 00:33:04.040
and you know that U2 did
the "Sunday Bloody Sunday"

00:33:04.040 --> 00:33:05.410
video there.

00:33:05.410 --> 00:33:07.450
And you're like, now
I got to go out there.

00:33:07.450 --> 00:33:08.825
AUDIENCE: I saw
you at Red Rocks.

00:33:08.825 --> 00:33:09.700
G. LOVE: Oh, you did?

00:33:09.700 --> 00:33:10.490
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:33:10.490 --> 00:33:12.906
G. LOVE: Well, hopefully you
had a better time than I did.

00:33:12.906 --> 00:33:13.534
[LAUGHTER]

00:33:13.534 --> 00:33:14.700
AUDIENCE: I did, definitely.

00:33:14.700 --> 00:33:17.030
G. LOVE: Oh, good.

00:33:17.030 --> 00:33:17.720
Yeah.

00:33:17.720 --> 00:33:19.910
So, yeah, it can
happen anywhere.

00:33:19.910 --> 00:33:24.147
But I just like to--

00:33:24.147 --> 00:33:25.480
I like the experience, you know?

00:33:28.459 --> 00:33:29.000
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:33:29.000 --> 00:33:30.337
Thanks for coming in today.

00:33:30.337 --> 00:33:31.670
Like Laura, I'm a long time fan.

00:33:31.670 --> 00:33:34.260
I think the first time I saw you
was 10 years ago with Donavon

00:33:34.260 --> 00:33:36.200
Frankenreiter and Jack Johnson.

00:33:36.200 --> 00:33:39.930
So you've described
yourself as hip hop blues.

00:33:39.930 --> 00:33:43.040
So how did you meet up with
Jack Johnson and "Brushfire

00:33:43.040 --> 00:33:43.630
Fairytales"?

00:33:43.630 --> 00:33:46.730
That's very not
hip hop in a sense.

00:33:46.730 --> 00:33:48.730
It's a good blend of the two.

00:33:48.730 --> 00:33:51.920
So how did you meet
up with those guys?

00:33:51.920 --> 00:33:54.370
G. LOVE: Well, that's
a good story, too.

00:33:57.680 --> 00:34:01.674
Jack was-- OK, a buddy of
mine from Avalon, New Jersey--

00:34:01.674 --> 00:34:03.590
because I grew up in
Philadelphia in the city,

00:34:03.590 --> 00:34:06.080
but then in the summer
time me and my family

00:34:06.080 --> 00:34:08.000
would stay in at
the Jersey Shore.

00:34:08.000 --> 00:34:11.870
So I grew up surfing,
and so I had a lot of--

00:34:11.870 --> 00:34:15.600
you know, we had a little
surf town in New Jersey.

00:34:15.600 --> 00:34:20.630
One of these guys that
I was growing up with,

00:34:20.630 --> 00:34:22.909
he ended up being
a surf photographer

00:34:22.909 --> 00:34:27.440
and met up with Jack Johnson
and the Malloy brothers.

00:34:27.440 --> 00:34:29.810
And they were making
these surf films,

00:34:29.810 --> 00:34:32.780
and they were stealing my music.

00:34:32.780 --> 00:34:37.909
So they had put about
seven of our tunes

00:34:37.909 --> 00:34:42.230
in a couple of their movies
and not cleared it, you know?

00:34:42.230 --> 00:34:44.840
So a surfing buddy
was, like, hey, man--

00:34:44.840 --> 00:34:46.200
yo, G., man.

00:34:46.200 --> 00:34:48.199
This kid I looked up to
my whole life, you know,

00:34:48.199 --> 00:34:50.900
because I was never
very good at surfing.

00:34:50.900 --> 00:34:53.604
So the cool kid was like,
yo, Garrett, come over.

00:34:53.604 --> 00:34:55.520
You've got to come over
to my house right now.

00:34:55.520 --> 00:34:56.840
Oh, my god.

00:34:56.840 --> 00:34:59.230
And then he was like, look,
your music's in this movie.

00:34:59.230 --> 00:35:00.920
I was like, damn,
they stole that shit.

00:35:00.920 --> 00:35:03.440
[LAUGHTER]

00:35:03.440 --> 00:35:05.450
So then we got in
touch with them.

00:35:05.450 --> 00:35:10.130
So the first interaction with
Jack and his surfing buddies

00:35:10.130 --> 00:35:12.170
was like, yo, you
stole our music.

00:35:12.170 --> 00:35:15.950
And then they said, OK, well,
here's some surf wax and surf

00:35:15.950 --> 00:35:17.220
leashes and track top.

00:35:17.220 --> 00:35:19.400
Like, OK, thanks.

00:35:19.400 --> 00:35:24.470
But then I did have the
opportunity to meet Jack.

00:35:24.470 --> 00:35:30.172
So he was just a kid,
and he had a guitar,

00:35:30.172 --> 00:35:31.130
and we went for a surf.

00:35:31.130 --> 00:35:37.040
And then we traded songs, and he
kept singing all of his tunes.

00:35:37.040 --> 00:35:39.140
One part of me was like,
this guy's a cool kid.

00:35:39.140 --> 00:35:42.400
And one part of me was like,
this guy's a fucking rockstar.

00:35:42.400 --> 00:35:44.120
And the songs were like--

00:35:44.120 --> 00:35:46.520
he basically played me
that whole first record,

00:35:46.520 --> 00:35:50.420
"Brushfire
Fairytales," and yeah.

00:35:50.420 --> 00:35:52.790
So I think long
story short, he was

00:35:52.790 --> 00:35:54.530
a big fan from when he grew up.

00:35:58.280 --> 00:36:01.010
It's been great, because
our music has really

00:36:01.010 --> 00:36:03.200
rubbed off on one another.

00:36:03.200 --> 00:36:05.540
And actually, if you do
listen to Jack's flow,

00:36:05.540 --> 00:36:08.990
he actually really
is like a rapper.

00:36:08.990 --> 00:36:11.930
He's actually-- even
though he's not a rapper,

00:36:11.930 --> 00:36:16.730
he's floating as if--
and he's a real lyricist.

00:36:16.730 --> 00:36:19.117
Yeah, it's been a
great relationship.

00:36:24.219 --> 00:36:25.510
AUDIENCE: Thanks for coming in.

00:36:25.510 --> 00:36:28.750
Any favorite memories
or funny stories

00:36:28.750 --> 00:36:31.510
from traveling or being on
the road all those years?

00:36:34.300 --> 00:36:36.190
G. LOVE: Yeah, a couple.

00:36:36.190 --> 00:36:38.500
I'm trying to think if there
was a good one in Detroit.

00:36:41.079 --> 00:36:41.620
I don't know.

00:36:41.620 --> 00:36:43.330
Do you want to
hear a dirty story?

00:36:43.330 --> 00:36:46.247
[LAUGHTER]

00:36:46.247 --> 00:36:46.830
AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:36:49.534 --> 00:36:50.450
G. LOVE: I don't know.

00:36:53.240 --> 00:36:55.030
Well, I don't know.

00:36:55.030 --> 00:36:56.572
There is one funny--

00:36:56.572 --> 00:36:58.030
I don't want to
tell a dirty story.

00:36:58.030 --> 00:36:58.610
I always do this.

00:36:58.610 --> 00:36:59.610
AUDIENCE: Tell us after.

00:36:59.610 --> 00:37:00.522
G. LOVE: What's that?

00:37:00.522 --> 00:37:01.960
AUDIENCE: Tell us
the dirty one after.

00:37:01.960 --> 00:37:02.751
G. LOVE: OK, after.

00:37:05.380 --> 00:37:07.690
That's like a tough
question, tell a funny story

00:37:07.690 --> 00:37:10.726
from the road.

00:37:10.726 --> 00:37:13.649
I don't know.

00:37:13.649 --> 00:37:14.190
I don't know.

00:37:14.190 --> 00:37:15.648
Let me come back
to that, because I

00:37:15.648 --> 00:37:20.140
got to think of one that's
not too dirty and appropriate

00:37:20.140 --> 00:37:21.295
for the internet.

00:37:21.295 --> 00:37:23.554
[LAUGHTER]

00:37:23.554 --> 00:37:24.970
SPEAKER: Well, as
you think of it,

00:37:24.970 --> 00:37:27.512
we probably have time for
one, maybe two more questions,

00:37:27.512 --> 00:37:28.720
before we do the performance.

00:37:28.720 --> 00:37:30.146
So again, raise your hand.

00:37:33.149 --> 00:37:34.190
AUDIENCE: How's it going?

00:37:34.190 --> 00:37:34.700
G. LOVE: Good.

00:37:34.700 --> 00:37:36.366
AUDIENCE: So you
mentioned you obviously

00:37:36.366 --> 00:37:38.090
are very influenced
by the blues,

00:37:38.090 --> 00:37:40.630
and you specifically called
out Buddy Guy as somebody

00:37:40.630 --> 00:37:42.170
that you'd open for before.

00:37:42.170 --> 00:37:44.480
I was wondering if there was
like ever a group you were

00:37:44.480 --> 00:37:46.605
opening for that you were
a big fan of or like kind

00:37:46.605 --> 00:37:49.040
of starstruck going in
and talking with them

00:37:49.040 --> 00:37:50.900
and kind of how that played out.

00:37:50.900 --> 00:37:51.740
G. LOVE: Yeah.

00:37:51.740 --> 00:37:55.150
That's a lot of people.

00:37:55.150 --> 00:37:57.660
Well, actually,
here's a funny story,

00:37:57.660 --> 00:37:59.290
and it will go with
the last one, too.

00:37:59.290 --> 00:38:03.200
But this is kind of a funny one,
because it kind of encompasses

00:38:03.200 --> 00:38:04.001
both things.

00:38:04.001 --> 00:38:06.500
Back in the day there was this
festival, The H.O.R.D.E Tour,

00:38:06.500 --> 00:38:07.640
right?

00:38:07.640 --> 00:38:13.100
And this is cool because
Blues Traveler, who actually I

00:38:13.100 --> 00:38:15.360
toured with last summer,
this was their thing,

00:38:15.360 --> 00:38:16.490
and they were running it.

00:38:16.490 --> 00:38:21.440
And this was amazing,
because three years

00:38:21.440 --> 00:38:24.320
before I had jumped over
the fence when I was 16

00:38:24.320 --> 00:38:26.450
and snuck into the Blues
Traveler opening up

00:38:26.450 --> 00:38:28.970
for the Allman Brothers
show in Philadelphia.

00:38:28.970 --> 00:38:32.420
And I was like, you know,
backstage at catering,

00:38:32.420 --> 00:38:34.310
and there's John Popper
and all these people

00:38:34.310 --> 00:38:35.900
and all these musicians.

00:38:35.900 --> 00:38:38.180
And this one guy comes
up to me and goes,

00:38:38.180 --> 00:38:39.530
hey, man, are you G. Love?

00:38:39.530 --> 00:38:41.580
And I was kind of
pretty shy when I was--

00:38:41.580 --> 00:38:46.430
well, not shy, but when I
was 20 I was a different guy.

00:38:46.430 --> 00:38:49.800
I was kind of keeping to myself.

00:38:49.800 --> 00:38:51.710
Hey, are you G. Love?

00:38:51.710 --> 00:38:52.390
Oh, yeah, I am.

00:38:52.390 --> 00:38:53.139
How are you doing?

00:38:53.139 --> 00:38:55.880
Oh, man, I really love your
record, really big fan.

00:38:55.880 --> 00:38:58.400
Oh, thank you so much.

00:38:58.400 --> 00:39:00.170
And I'm like, you know,
so what do you do?

00:39:00.170 --> 00:39:01.629
Oh, are you a musician?

00:39:01.629 --> 00:39:02.670
Oh, yeah, I'm a musician.

00:39:05.640 --> 00:39:09.780
Well, what's your name?

00:39:09.780 --> 00:39:10.410
I'm Dave.

00:39:10.410 --> 00:39:11.118
Nice to meet you.

00:39:11.118 --> 00:39:14.910
Well, what's your-- what's
the name of your band?

00:39:14.910 --> 00:39:16.080
Oh, Dave Matthews Band.

00:39:16.080 --> 00:39:17.337
[LAUGHTER]

00:39:17.337 --> 00:39:18.420
I was like all right, man.

00:39:18.420 --> 00:39:19.710
Well, great to meet you, man.

00:39:19.710 --> 00:39:20.250
Good luck.

00:39:20.250 --> 00:39:21.083
Good luck out there.

00:39:21.083 --> 00:39:23.820
[LAUGHTER]

00:39:23.820 --> 00:39:25.570
I had no idea who he was.

00:39:25.570 --> 00:39:27.840
He was like, yeah,
I'm Dave Matthews.

00:39:27.840 --> 00:39:29.670
What's your band?

00:39:29.670 --> 00:39:32.090
Oh, Dave Matthews Band.

00:39:32.090 --> 00:39:33.300
And so now like--

00:39:33.300 --> 00:39:35.950
and then, of course, Dave
Matthews from that summer,

00:39:35.950 --> 00:39:37.901
which was '95, that
was probably when

00:39:37.901 --> 00:39:39.150
he was just starting to break.

00:39:39.150 --> 00:39:41.024
But, like, I was just
listening to the blues.

00:39:41.024 --> 00:39:43.720
I had no idea who this guy was.

00:39:43.720 --> 00:39:47.220
It took me years to understand
kind of what they do,

00:39:47.220 --> 00:39:50.580
and why it's successful, and why
people love it, and I love it.

00:39:50.580 --> 00:39:53.820
But now I have a running
thing of like stupid things

00:39:53.820 --> 00:39:55.800
that I say to Dave Matthews.

00:39:55.800 --> 00:39:58.710
Because every time I see Dave--
he's like the nicest guy.

00:39:58.710 --> 00:40:02.100
But every time I'd say
the stupidest shit to him

00:40:02.100 --> 00:40:04.230
every time.

00:40:04.230 --> 00:40:08.870
Because whenever you open for
him, he'll come backstage.

00:40:08.870 --> 00:40:10.860
He's one of the few
guys, when you're

00:40:10.860 --> 00:40:13.080
opening for him,
whoever's opening for him,

00:40:13.080 --> 00:40:15.960
he meets you backstage,
and then he introduces

00:40:15.960 --> 00:40:19.620
you to like the five people
that aren't in the parking lot,

00:40:19.620 --> 00:40:21.720
and they're actually going
to watch you play out

00:40:21.720 --> 00:40:25.740
of the 50,000 that
are going to be there.

00:40:25.740 --> 00:40:28.560
I think the last time I
said to Dave, I was like--

00:40:31.500 --> 00:40:32.910
it was at The Gorge.

00:40:32.910 --> 00:40:36.030
And they had this bluegrass
guy sitting in with them.

00:40:36.030 --> 00:40:38.040
And he sang this
great song called,

00:40:38.040 --> 00:40:40.080
"By the Side of the Road."

00:40:40.080 --> 00:40:42.227
And I was like, oh, this
is the greatest song ever,

00:40:42.227 --> 00:40:43.310
"By the Side of the Road."

00:40:43.310 --> 00:40:46.860
So then the second
day, Dave's there,

00:40:46.860 --> 00:40:49.270
and his voice was hurting.

00:40:49.270 --> 00:40:52.430
And I go, Dave, man,
great show last night.

00:40:52.430 --> 00:40:54.550
I got a new favorite song.

00:40:54.550 --> 00:40:55.870
And he's like, oh, which one?

00:40:55.870 --> 00:40:58.600
I was like, "By the
Side of the Road."

00:40:58.600 --> 00:40:59.650
It's not even his song.

00:40:59.650 --> 00:41:01.210
It's the other guy's song.

00:41:01.210 --> 00:41:02.000
I'm like, fuck.

00:41:02.000 --> 00:41:05.140
[LAUGHTER]

00:41:05.140 --> 00:41:08.740
Anyway, yeah, but long story
short, yeah, I get starstruck.

00:41:08.740 --> 00:41:10.740
I get starstruck a lot.

00:41:10.740 --> 00:41:11.830
That's probably like why--

00:41:11.830 --> 00:41:13.630
I'm like a fan
first, which is why

00:41:13.630 --> 00:41:17.480
I get people to sign my guitar.

00:41:17.480 --> 00:41:20.620
The most recent funny one
was we toured with Cypress

00:41:20.620 --> 00:41:22.360
Hill two summers ago.

00:41:22.360 --> 00:41:25.210
And my guitar tech is
named Big Scrimp, right?

00:41:25.210 --> 00:41:26.740
And he's this big,
fat, bald guy,

00:41:26.740 --> 00:41:28.180
and he looks real
mean and tough.

00:41:28.180 --> 00:41:29.950
But you know, he's one of these
guys who's like a teddy bear

00:41:29.950 --> 00:41:31.180
once you know him.

00:41:31.180 --> 00:41:35.740
But him and I are really
big fans of Cypress Hill.

00:41:35.740 --> 00:41:39.150
So we're like two little
schoolgirls in catering,

00:41:39.150 --> 00:41:41.770
we're like, there's B-Real.

00:41:41.770 --> 00:41:42.820
There's Sen Dog.

00:41:42.820 --> 00:41:45.880
I'm like, hey, hey,
B. We used to have

00:41:45.880 --> 00:41:49.600
all these jokes, like, yeah,
we get totally starstruck.

00:41:49.600 --> 00:41:51.554
It's pretty funny.

00:41:51.554 --> 00:41:53.470
SPEAKER: So you guys are
ready for some music?

00:41:53.470 --> 00:41:53.810
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:41:53.810 --> 00:41:54.640
SPEAKER: All right.

00:41:54.640 --> 00:41:57.106
G. LOVE: Oh, man.

00:41:57.106 --> 00:42:04.830
This song is about I-95 and
everything that happens on it.

00:42:04.830 --> 00:42:07.780
One time I was driving from New
York City back up to Boston,

00:42:07.780 --> 00:42:09.414
and I wrote it down.

00:42:09.414 --> 00:42:11.342
And it goes like this.

00:42:14.716 --> 00:42:16.611
(SINGING) I'm going
back to Boston.

00:42:16.611 --> 00:42:19.377
I think I'm losing my mind.

00:42:19.377 --> 00:42:25.140
I'm going back to
Boston, driving I-95.

00:42:25.140 --> 00:42:28.270
Well, I know your girl, she
ain't no friend of mine.

00:42:30.800 --> 00:42:35.306
Boston called me, and see them
women wearin' too much clothes.

00:42:35.306 --> 00:42:39.890
Yeah, them Boston girls, they
don't like to stay at home.

00:42:39.890 --> 00:42:42.210
Oh, when that sun
is shining, they

00:42:42.210 --> 00:42:44.064
got a lot of leg that shows.

00:42:44.064 --> 00:42:47.438
Show it, baby.

00:42:47.438 --> 00:42:52.212
Whoa, I'm a good man, so
I need a good woman, too.

00:42:52.212 --> 00:42:54.340
I'm a real good man.

00:42:54.340 --> 00:42:57.582
Oh, I need a good woman, too.

00:42:57.582 --> 00:43:03.416
Well, that girl I love don't do
nothin' but give me the blues.

00:43:03.416 --> 00:43:05.360
Blues.

00:43:05.360 --> 00:43:10.748
Whoa, we was to be married,
married in the spring.

00:43:10.748 --> 00:43:12.242
Whoa, married.

00:43:12.242 --> 00:43:15.230
I'd give her my diamond ring.

00:43:15.230 --> 00:43:17.222
Whoa, now she changed her mind.

00:43:17.222 --> 00:43:19.214
She doing' her own thing.

00:43:19.214 --> 00:43:21.206
Now do your thing,
baby, like this now.

00:43:24.692 --> 00:43:27.182
I like it when you
do your thing now.

00:43:27.182 --> 00:43:32.162
I just wish you'd do your thing
with me one of these old times.

00:43:35.150 --> 00:43:38.138

hearted, but, baby.

00:56:29.990 --> 00:56:31.424
Oh, honey.

00:56:31.424 --> 00:56:34.090
Oh, honey, now, I
need some time alone

00:56:34.090 --> 00:56:37.125
with the crew to do the stupid
things that we used to do.

00:56:37.125 --> 00:56:39.750
Upon this she slammed
me with a frying pan.

00:56:39.750 --> 00:56:40.950
Ain't it love.

00:56:40.950 --> 00:56:41.965
I can't leave her, man.

00:56:41.965 --> 00:56:44.150
She got sauce.

00:56:44.150 --> 00:56:46.360
You know my baby got sauce.

00:56:46.360 --> 00:56:48.330
You know my baby got sauce.

00:56:48.330 --> 00:56:50.830
Your baby ain't sweet like mine.

00:56:50.830 --> 00:56:52.300
She ain't sweet like mine.

00:56:52.300 --> 00:56:53.035
She got sauce.

00:56:53.035 --> 00:56:54.580
Your baby ain't sweet like mine.

00:56:54.580 --> 00:56:56.490
She got sauce.

00:56:56.490 --> 00:56:59.026
Oh, she got that sauce.

00:56:59.026 --> 00:57:01.018
Yes, she do.

00:57:01.018 --> 00:57:03.010
And it's so sweet, too.

00:57:03.010 --> 00:57:05.998
Oh, baby.

00:57:05.998 --> 00:57:11.476
Now, oh, honey.

00:57:11.476 --> 00:57:14.962
[PLAYING HARMONICA]

00:57:44.390 --> 00:57:45.840
You know my baby got sauce.

00:57:45.840 --> 00:57:47.650
And of course, as a
matter, of course,

00:57:47.650 --> 00:57:50.110
she does what she wants
to, because she's the boss.

00:57:50.110 --> 00:57:52.280
Please don't tell my
friends about our situation.

00:57:52.280 --> 00:57:54.975
They think I'm on some
extended vacation.

00:57:54.975 --> 00:57:57.065
I don't get out and
see my boys anymore.

00:57:57.065 --> 00:57:58.830
The only time I
leave my house is

00:57:58.830 --> 00:58:00.597
to go to the store
for some of what

00:58:00.597 --> 00:58:02.416
she, what she, what
she want me for.

00:58:02.416 --> 00:58:03.904
What could she want this time?

00:58:03.904 --> 00:58:06.384
I'm all hers.

00:58:06.384 --> 00:58:08.880
She ain't even hardly mine.

00:58:08.880 --> 00:58:09.485
Oh, baby.

00:58:09.485 --> 00:58:13.140
And believe me, what she
do at night, I don't know.

00:58:13.140 --> 00:58:14.600
I know that something
ain't right,

00:58:14.600 --> 00:58:15.870
because she got me waitin'.

00:58:15.870 --> 00:58:18.510
She comes so late, and I
try not to raise my voice,

00:58:18.510 --> 00:58:19.700
negotiate it.

00:58:19.700 --> 00:58:21.200
Yo, she'll win the argument.

00:58:21.200 --> 00:58:22.420
Shouldn't have started it.

00:58:22.420 --> 00:58:24.545
I'm broken hearted, but
you know I can't be parted.

00:58:24.545 --> 00:58:26.090
Because my baby needs a taste.

00:58:26.090 --> 00:58:27.440
I count my loss.

00:58:27.440 --> 00:58:28.760
Woo!

00:58:28.760 --> 00:58:31.534
She got that sauce.

00:58:31.534 --> 00:58:33.290
Oh, yeah.

00:58:33.290 --> 00:58:34.600
You know my baby got sauce.

00:58:34.600 --> 00:58:36.894
Your baby ain't sweet like mine.

00:58:36.894 --> 00:58:38.940
Oh, she ain't sweet like mine.

00:58:38.940 --> 00:58:39.737
She got sauce.

00:58:39.737 --> 00:58:41.070
Your baby ain't sweet like mine.

00:58:41.070 --> 00:58:43.381
She got sauce.

00:58:43.381 --> 00:58:45.300
Yeah, she got sauce.

00:58:45.300 --> 00:58:46.590
Oh, she do.

00:58:46.590 --> 00:58:48.210
She's so sweet, too.

00:58:48.210 --> 00:58:49.830
She got that sauce.

00:59:01.530 --> 00:59:02.730
[APPLAUSE]

00:59:02.730 --> 00:59:03.630
Thank you, guys.

00:59:03.630 --> 00:59:05.430
I appreciate it.

00:59:05.430 --> 00:59:08.780
[APPLAUSE]
