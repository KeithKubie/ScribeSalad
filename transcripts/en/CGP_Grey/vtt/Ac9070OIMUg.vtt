00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:04.620
In the main video, I went through a couple of quick little examples of STV elections,

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:09.780
but in this extra video, I want to take a bigger election and go through it in a little bit more depth

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:13.260
so that you can see how an STV election unfolds.

00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:19.600
In this case we are going to have 10 candidates, and there are going to be five seats for representative open.

00:00:19.620 --> 00:00:23.560
So that means each candidate needs to get 20% to win.

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:27.820
So citizens go off to the polls and their first choice results come in as follows:

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:29.000
Tarsier gets 5%

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:30.880
Gorilla gets 32%

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:32.420
Silverback gets 3%

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:34.060
Owl gets 33%

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:35.200
Turtle gets 1%

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:36.240
Snake gets 1%

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:37.460
Tiger gets 16%

00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:38.620
Lynx gets 4%

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:39.960
Jackelope gets 2%

00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:41.740
and Buffalo gets 3%.

00:00:41.740 --> 00:00:47.400
Now what we can see here is a situation that is very often the case in real elections with STV

00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:51.100
That there are two or three parties with a lot of support

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:53.520
--in this case Gorilla, Owl, and Tiger--

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:56.740
and there are a bunch of parties that have less than 5% of the vote.

00:00:56.740 --> 00:00:58.200
So let's see how this works out.

00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:04.420
First, Gorilla and Owl get awarded a seat because they have both crossed the threshold required to win.

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:07.080
Both candidates have more votes than they actually needed to get in,

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:11.520
which means they have more support among the population than just their one candidate can provide.

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:17.080
You take a look at which candidate has the biggest surplus votes first and redistribute those.

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:23.280
Owl has 32%, she has the biggest surplus. Her voters' second choice is the most important thing to figure out

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:25.540
and in this case it is Turtle.

00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:27.360
Next up, Gorilla has a surplus of votes.

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:33.600
Now, up until this point we've been pretending that all citizens in the animal kingdom vote in exactly the same way.

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:37.580
But in real elections, voters don't all agree on what their second choice is.

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:43.240
So Gorilla voters, it turns out, are split between Tarsier and Silverback for their second choice.

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:49.300
There are very many ways to try to resolve this situation of what happens when second choice votes are split.

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:54.280
But to simplify a little bit, we can just say that those votes are distributed proportionally.

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:59.480
So in this case, 2-to-1 voters like Silverback over Tarsier as their second choice.

00:01:59.480 --> 00:02:04.880
So that is how the votes get distributed, bumping Silverback up to 11% and Tarsier up to 9%.

00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:11.220
At this point, nobody has a surplus of votes anymore and nobody's over the threshold, so we start eliminating the biggest loser first.

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:18.480
In this case, that is Snake. Snake was never going to win and so those votes go to Snake voters' second choice which is Turtle.

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:21.040
Next up, Jackelope is the biggest loser.

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:24.460
Now, what happens here is Jackelope voters only like Jackelope.

00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:30.520
They don't like any other candidate. They think everybody else is equally bad and only Jackelope is awesome.

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:33.380
So they just put a one next to Jackelope on their voting ballot,

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:35.720
and nothing next to anybody else.

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:42.020
What happens in this situation is Jackelope votes are actually just removed from the election at this stage.

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:45.740
Their voters have said that they don't care if Jackelope doesn't win.

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:47.840
So it's almost like they didn't vote.

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:49.480
Next up, Buffalo is eliminated.

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:54.020
Now, his voters put Jackelope as second choice, but since Jackelope has been already eliminated,

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:56.240
his votes can't go there.

00:02:56.240 --> 00:03:01.980
In STV it does matter that you're able to get a certain number of peoples' first choice vote.

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:05.540
Sometimes people criticize the system for that, but I don't think it's unreasonable

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:09.240
to consider that first choice votes matter more than other votes.

00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:13.440
Since Buffalo voters can't move to their second choice 2/3rds of Buffalo voters don't care at this point

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:16.520
they wanted Buffalo or Jackelope and they don't like anybody else,

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:19.280
and 1/3rd of Buffalo voters back Turtle.

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:23.760
So Turtle has gotten another little slice of 1% bringing him up to 16% and tied with Tiger.

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:26.320
But, the next biggest loser is Lynx.

00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:32.680
Lynx votes go to Tiger, and Tiger is selected as the next representative for reaching the voting threshold.

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:35.540
Next biggest loser is Tasier. Sorry Tarsier.

00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:40.480
Tarsier at this stage has votes both from citizens who selected her as their first choice

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:44.460
and candidates who selected her as their second choice after Gorilla.

00:03:44.460 --> 00:03:48.960
So when these votes are redistributed, some of them are going to their second choice

00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:51.300
and some of them are going to their third choice.

00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:55.560
But simians stick together, and so towards Silverback is where they go.

00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:58.840
Silverback is elected as the next representative.

00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:01.880
Finally, the question is what to do with Turtle.

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:04.820
Turtle is the next biggest loser and hasn't reached the threshold

00:04:04.820 --> 00:04:07.500
but there are five seats open in this election.

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:13.560
The rule under most STV systems is that if you have one seat open, and you have one candidate remaining,

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:17.160
even if they didn't quite reach the threshold, they still get in.

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:20.140
And so Turtle is elected as our final representative.

00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:24.700
If we jump back to the beginning, we can see that this has turned out to be a pretty good result.

00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:27.680
Our biggest sections of the population were Gorilla and Owl

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:30.680
and they ended up getting both their first and second choices.

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:33.340
Tiger and Lynx were the next biggest sections of the population.

00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:34.660
They got one of their choices.

00:04:34.660 --> 00:04:37.800
A lot of parties agreed that they were OK with Turtle as their next choice,

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:41.640
and those votes prevented Turtle from getting eliminated in any particular round.

00:04:41.640 --> 00:04:43.640
And so Turtle, too, is a representative.
