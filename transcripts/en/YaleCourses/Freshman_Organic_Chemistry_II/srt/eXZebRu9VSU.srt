1
00:00:02,130 --> 00:00:03,570
Okay.
So as we said were,

2
00:00:03,870 --> 00:00:08,580
most of the lectures nowadays are about
carbonyl chemistry and in particular

3
00:00:08,581 --> 00:00:12,030
today we're going to talk about
[inaudible] means the nitrogen analog of a

4
00:00:12,031 --> 00:00:16,470
carbonyl group and ina means, which
you'll see are closely related to those.

5
00:00:17,190 --> 00:00:21,780
And then get onto the general topic of
oxidation reduction and how it applies in

6
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:27,090
organic chemistry. And in its simplest
case where it involves electron transfer.

7
00:00:27,630 --> 00:00:31,830
In the unlikely event we have any time
we'll review Nmr a little bit at the end.

8
00:00:33,420 --> 00:00:38,100
Bear in mind, this isn't on the exam
Friday, but it will be on the final.

9
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:42,840
Okay. We talked last time about
a ketone going to an mean.

10
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:48,330
So you have an amine, it's unshared.
Pair is a nucleophile to attack Pi Star,

11
00:00:48,720 --> 00:00:53,400
put a proton, then I'll take a proton
off the nitrogen onto the oxygen minus.

12
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:55,650
You get this carbon Ola mean,

13
00:00:56,730 --> 00:01:00,390
and then the unshared pair
allows you to lose hydroxide,

14
00:01:01,650 --> 00:01:02,480
right?

15
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:07,480
So you get this cad ion and a minium
ion protonated amine and hydroxide,

16
00:01:10,011 --> 00:01:14,550
but the hydroxide can take
the proton away. Okay?

17
00:01:14,551 --> 00:01:18,090
So that's how you make emotions.
And we mentioned that last time.

18
00:01:18,091 --> 00:01:21,120
The amine is the nitrogen
analog of a carbonyl group.

19
00:01:23,230 --> 00:01:23,760
Uh,

20
00:01:23,760 --> 00:01:27,240
the n the equilibrium constant
for this, however, is unfavorable.

21
00:01:27,300 --> 00:01:29,430
It lies toward the starting ketone,

22
00:01:30,180 --> 00:01:34,830
but there are some cases
where the equilibrium lies
the other way. For example,

23
00:01:34,860 --> 00:01:36,780
with Oih as the r group,

24
00:01:36,810 --> 00:01:41,810
it lies toward the right that's called
an oxy or when this complicated thing is

25
00:01:42,811 --> 00:01:43,860
used as the amine,

26
00:01:43,890 --> 00:01:48,570
the equilibrium lies to the right and
that's called a two four Denitra fennel

27
00:01:48,571 --> 00:01:52,440
hydra zone or a two four d n p derivative.

28
00:01:52,650 --> 00:01:57,180
And these things were really important
before Nmr came along. And, and,

29
00:01:57,270 --> 00:02:01,620
and I are to allow you to characterize
compounds because you had these,

30
00:02:01,860 --> 00:02:06,750
these, uh, uh, ketone liquids
typically that were very difficult to,

31
00:02:06,780 --> 00:02:08,730
to, uh, to deal with.

32
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:14,120
But if you treated them with hydroxyl
amine at the top or two for die nitrile

33
00:02:14,251 --> 00:02:15,900
fennel hydrazine at the bottom,

34
00:02:16,260 --> 00:02:20,280
they created the AUC seem or
the two for DNP derivatives,

35
00:02:20,670 --> 00:02:24,870
which were easy to crystallize and
gave nice sharp melting points.

36
00:02:25,140 --> 00:02:29,310
So there were tables of all different
ketones and what their oxygen's melted at

37
00:02:29,311 --> 00:02:32,520
and what they're two, four d
and p derivatives melted. At.

38
00:02:32,790 --> 00:02:35,640
So you've made a couple of these
derivatives beige or their melting point,

39
00:02:35,641 --> 00:02:39,000
and then you knew what ketone you had
if you didn't have Nmr to help you out.

40
00:02:39,330 --> 00:02:44,010
So these were very important and you'll
see that that such, uh, compounds,

41
00:02:44,011 --> 00:02:48,840
this kind of in mean is important
in, in, uh, biology as well.

42
00:02:49,320 --> 00:02:52,420
Now,
why do these equilibria right?

43
00:02:52,460 --> 00:02:56,160
Lie to the right when with an
[inaudible] group at lies to the left.

44
00:02:57,400 --> 00:02:58,233
Okay,

45
00:02:58,250 --> 00:03:02,290
so let's think about, we have an
unshared pair here on the, uh,

46
00:03:02,350 --> 00:03:05,830
on the group that's attached to nitrogen
where we don't have an unshared pair

47
00:03:05,831 --> 00:03:09,670
here. How might that help the
equilibrium lie to the right?

48
00:03:10,270 --> 00:03:12,280
How might it stabilize the products?

49
00:03:12,670 --> 00:03:17,670
The fact that you have an a mean which
has a Hetero atom with an unshared pair

50
00:03:18,041 --> 00:03:22,270
next door. What special stability
might you get on the right from that,

51
00:03:22,271 --> 00:03:26,890
that you wouldn't get on the left?
Anybody got an idea?

52
00:03:29,740 --> 00:03:31,360
What's good about this compound?

53
00:03:31,361 --> 00:03:34,270
Having an unshared pair
here attached to the Amine,

54
00:03:38,020 --> 00:03:38,950
Matt,
you got an idea?

55
00:03:42,830 --> 00:03:46,460
Sure. You got the Pi Star here
and it can overlap with that.

56
00:03:46,461 --> 00:03:50,630
So you get special stability on there,
right? It's uh, it's our Lilly, the,

57
00:03:50,810 --> 00:03:55,310
the unshared pair is adjacent to
the, uh, to the, uh, double bond.

58
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:57,410
So you got special stability on the right.

59
00:03:57,770 --> 00:04:02,060
Now how about on the left does heavy the
unshared pair on the left to make any

60
00:04:02,061 --> 00:04:06,200
difference that would help
the reaction go to the right,

61
00:04:07,570 --> 00:04:07,910
right.

62
00:04:07,910 --> 00:04:12,200
Is there any reason it should be unstable
to have that unshared pair adjacent to

63
00:04:12,201 --> 00:04:13,430
the nitrogen on the left?

64
00:04:14,010 --> 00:04:14,843
Hmm.

65
00:04:16,140 --> 00:04:19,320
Bear in mind that the nitrogen
itself has an unshared pair.

66
00:04:20,460 --> 00:04:21,690
What if they overlap

67
00:04:24,470 --> 00:04:25,303
right?

68
00:04:25,490 --> 00:04:30,200
If you have to occupied orbitals
come together, they mix up and down,

69
00:04:30,201 --> 00:04:34,940
but up more than down the unshared
pairs repel one another, right? So the,

70
00:04:35,270 --> 00:04:39,020
so it's unstable on the left because
of the overlap of unshared pairs.

71
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:43,430
So both of these factors shift the
equilibrium toward being stable as,

72
00:04:43,431 --> 00:04:47,600
as it means as oxy or two for
dinitrogen mental hydra zone. Now,

73
00:04:47,601 --> 00:04:52,010
there are other cases where, uh, it
means a very important, for example, uh,

74
00:04:52,011 --> 00:04:56,540
in the olden days when, when it was
difficult to separate compounds,

75
00:04:56,950 --> 00:04:59,390
uh, it's still can be difficult
to separate compounds,

76
00:04:59,391 --> 00:05:02,660
but there are a lot more techniques
nowadays with fancy chromatic graphic

77
00:05:02,661 --> 00:05:07,190
techniques for example. But
Gerard developed this, uh,

78
00:05:07,250 --> 00:05:11,780
this reagent which is you see one of these
things that has an unshared pair next

79
00:05:11,781 --> 00:05:16,460
to the nitrogen, so it'll make a
nice strong in mean a stable, I mean,

80
00:05:17,150 --> 00:05:19,070
and it could be reacted for example,

81
00:05:19,071 --> 00:05:24,050
with a ketone in cortisone
or a steroid hormone, right,

82
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:26,120
to make it soluble in water.

83
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:31,210
So without Gerard's reagent t it
would be dissolved in, in, uh, in,

84
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:34,460
it would dissolve when you
do an extraction it would
be in the organic layer,

85
00:05:34,850 --> 00:05:38,180
but if you add Gerard's reagent,
it goes into the water layer.

86
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:42,080
So you can separate it from other things
that would go into the one or the other

87
00:05:42,081 --> 00:05:44,390
of those layers.
How does that work?

88
00:05:44,870 --> 00:05:49,870
Why does you ards reagent make
the ketone soluble in water?

89
00:05:57,640 --> 00:05:58,473
What,

90
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:01,070
what's the nature of the polarity?

91
00:06:02,390 --> 00:06:06,110
It's more of that polarity
polarity is having,

92
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:10,610
is having something to sty polar
plus here on minus here, right?

93
00:06:11,300 --> 00:06:12,710
It's much more so than that.

94
00:06:13,670 --> 00:06:18,200
This reagent has a charge that
you can't get rid of, right?

95
00:06:18,201 --> 00:06:23,201
Cause there that nitrogen has for Al Keel
groups on it so it can't lose a proton

96
00:06:23,541 --> 00:06:26,900
and get rid of its charge.
So once this is hooked on to here,

97
00:06:27,080 --> 00:06:30,650
the molecule is permanently
a cad. I am, right?

98
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:34,280
So then it dissolves in water.
It's like a cat, a cat, ionic Emmy,

99
00:06:34,750 --> 00:06:39,230
a hydra zone. That is the hydro zone
is those things that have nitrogen,

100
00:06:39,231 --> 00:06:43,430
nitrogen, double bond, right?
Carbon. Okay. So there's a,

101
00:06:43,431 --> 00:06:45,830
there's another example
of the importance of Ibi.

102
00:06:45,860 --> 00:06:48,890
Now you remember this slide that you've
been reviewing for the test about,

103
00:06:49,220 --> 00:06:53,090
about chromophores, but let's just now
focused on this part down at the bottom.

104
00:06:53,510 --> 00:06:58,040
Notice that it's the end mean that holds
the Chroma for the thing that's going

105
00:06:58,041 --> 00:07:02,900
to be colored that conjugated system
onto a protein to make Rhodopsin.

106
00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:05,330
So that's what holds Retina Aldehyde.

107
00:07:05,960 --> 00:07:08,870
This was originally an Aldehyde
with an oxygen on here,

108
00:07:09,260 --> 00:07:11,810
but it get formed and [inaudible]
and got held to the protein.

109
00:07:11,811 --> 00:07:16,280
So it functions the way it's
supposed to do in your eye. Okay.

110
00:07:16,730 --> 00:07:20,870
It means are also important in
the synthesis of amino acids,

111
00:07:21,650 --> 00:07:23,790
particularly in the,
in the uh,

112
00:07:24,040 --> 00:07:29,030
an originally in the technique developed
by out off Stryker. Stryker was,

113
00:07:29,031 --> 00:07:33,530
uh, was a student and an
assistant in a later in, um,

114
00:07:33,750 --> 00:07:38,360
in leaving slab in Giessen we
talked about last time, but in 1854,

115
00:07:38,361 --> 00:07:43,361
he figured out how to make the amino
acid alanine by starting with acid

116
00:07:44,661 --> 00:07:49,070
Aldehyde, reacting it with moaning
fluoride and potassium cyanide.

117
00:07:49,700 --> 00:07:52,940
Now let's figure out how that happens.
First to react,

118
00:07:53,060 --> 00:07:55,190
the ammonia of ammonium chloride,

119
00:07:56,150 --> 00:07:59,350
which is an equilibrium of course
with ammonium chloride, uh,

120
00:07:59,390 --> 00:08:03,440
with the Keith with the
Aldehyde to make an mean. Okay.

121
00:08:04,700 --> 00:08:08,990
Then what's going to happen next do you
think given the reagents you have there,

122
00:08:10,850 --> 00:08:15,410
another reagent comes in,
the reagent that comes in is cyanide.

123
00:08:16,340 --> 00:08:18,260
What we'll sign cyanide I do with an Emmy

124
00:08:20,050 --> 00:08:23,240
cyanides and an ion a nucleophile.

125
00:08:23,750 --> 00:08:27,700
It's a special nucleophile cause
its nucleus like at carbon.

126
00:08:28,180 --> 00:08:31,390
So at carbon has a high homo on that,
then cyanide.

127
00:08:32,110 --> 00:08:34,570
So where's it going to attack Cassie?

128
00:08:37,340 --> 00:08:38,280
The Pi Star are the,

129
00:08:38,330 --> 00:08:42,480
I mean it would also attack the ketone
if you had the ketone there. Okay.

130
00:08:42,481 --> 00:08:45,700
So the cyanide comes down
to tax the amine, uh,

131
00:08:45,740 --> 00:08:49,410
that makes a negative charge on the
nitrogen when you formed a bond.

132
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:54,180
But you could put a proton on there,
right? So you get this compound,

133
00:08:55,140 --> 00:08:58,050
okay, now it that, that's the first stage.

134
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:03,080
Then you add strong acid and heated up
hydrochloric acid and water and heat it

135
00:09:03,301 --> 00:09:05,880
up.
Now you protonate the nitrogen,

136
00:09:05,881 --> 00:09:10,881
the unshared pair on the nitrogen with
the acid and now water can attack the the

137
00:09:12,620 --> 00:09:16,020
cat.
I had to give this and lose a proton.

138
00:09:17,970 --> 00:09:22,200
But now notice you have another sort of
him being like thing, carbon, nitrogen,

139
00:09:22,201 --> 00:09:26,580
double bond. And we already know that
that can react with water, right?

140
00:09:26,850 --> 00:09:30,900
To deliberate ammonia. We look, the
very first step was the same reaction,

141
00:09:30,901 --> 00:09:34,200
going the opposite direction,
taking the carbon neo off,

142
00:09:34,530 --> 00:09:39,180
putting the nitrogen on to make a new me.
Now we put an oxygen on,

143
00:09:39,181 --> 00:09:41,820
pulled the nitrogen off,
right? And that's Alanine.

144
00:09:42,150 --> 00:09:45,660
So he was able to make that
in 50 to 60% yield this way.

145
00:09:45,930 --> 00:09:49,680
So such a high yield from VF,
such very simple compounds,

146
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:54,300
suggests to a lot of people that this
could be involved in the origin of life.

147
00:09:54,301 --> 00:09:55,440
There are people who get into,

148
00:09:55,990 --> 00:09:59,310
into discussions and debates
about how life might've begun.

149
00:09:59,311 --> 00:10:01,080
One thing you need is amino acids.

150
00:10:01,380 --> 00:10:05,910
This could have provided amino acids
without any, uh, extraordinary,

151
00:10:06,180 --> 00:10:07,590
uh,
uh,

152
00:10:07,591 --> 00:10:11,730
requirements in terms of starting
materials and complicated mechanisms.

153
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:13,193
Okay.

154
00:10:13,290 --> 00:10:18,190
And notice as in passing here that
this is an important thing that our c n

155
00:10:18,250 --> 00:10:20,190
triple a night trial,

156
00:10:20,191 --> 00:10:24,510
carbon nitrogen triple
bond gives our COO h.

157
00:10:24,540 --> 00:10:29,540
So you could make carboxylic acids by
first using carbon as a nucleophile

158
00:10:29,940 --> 00:10:32,900
because the carbon is an ana,
the cyanide is an anti.

159
00:10:32,910 --> 00:10:36,450
And so it can displace a haylight
do these other things, right?

160
00:10:36,810 --> 00:10:40,930
And then you can change it into a,
into a carboxylic acid group.

161
00:10:40,931 --> 00:10:45,420
So that's a handy thing and synthesis,
which is exemplified here. Now,

162
00:10:45,421 --> 00:10:48,870
it's not only in the laboratory that
this kind of thing happens where you go

163
00:10:48,871 --> 00:10:53,871
through any of mean here's an imaging of
being used in a biosynthetic scheme to

164
00:10:54,571 --> 00:10:57,930
make the,
to make the amino acid glutamic acid.

165
00:10:58,590 --> 00:11:00,930
So it's the same deal as before.
You have,

166
00:11:01,260 --> 00:11:04,590
you have ammonia and you have Nadh,

167
00:11:04,591 --> 00:11:08,750
which we talked about last time we talked
about in terms of nuclear affiliate,

168
00:11:08,760 --> 00:11:11,310
aromatic substitution.
Okay.

169
00:11:11,520 --> 00:11:14,250
And of course there are enzymes
that control this whole thing.

170
00:11:14,251 --> 00:11:18,900
L glutamate dehydrogenase is that
is the one that does it. Okay.

171
00:11:18,901 --> 00:11:23,901
So first the ammonia reacts and gives
the mean and then the [inaudible],

172
00:11:24,180 --> 00:11:28,120
then, uh, uh, uh, then you, uh,

173
00:11:28,170 --> 00:11:31,950
protonate the nitrogen.
So you have a car,

174
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:33,210
carbon cad ion,

175
00:11:33,750 --> 00:11:38,750
and now the Nadh gets into the act because
you remember Nad h was nad plus two,

176
00:11:41,611 --> 00:11:46,140
which h minus had been added. If you
go back and review that, you'll see it.

177
00:11:46,380 --> 00:11:51,300
So it can, it can go the other way too.
It can give up h minus and make Nad plus.

178
00:11:51,690 --> 00:11:56,350
So now the h minus can come down
in the tack that carbon, right?

179
00:11:56,590 --> 00:11:58,150
And you have glutamic acid.

180
00:11:58,900 --> 00:12:02,320
And this is not for mammals
and essential amino acids.

181
00:12:02,321 --> 00:12:06,760
They don't have to get it in their diet
because they run this scheme themselves,

182
00:12:06,910 --> 00:12:08,080
right?
So they make it,

183
00:12:08,470 --> 00:12:13,180
they make it inside themselves
using El glutamate dehydrogenase.

184
00:12:13,420 --> 00:12:17,890
Now that's an interesting, uh,
name for the enzyme that does this.

185
00:12:18,220 --> 00:12:23,220
Because notice what we've done is that
the enzyme using the Nadh actually

186
00:12:23,260 --> 00:12:28,150
hydrogenated this, it puts h two
on a chair and a chair, right?

187
00:12:28,190 --> 00:12:29,920
The first stage came in as a proton,

188
00:12:30,190 --> 00:12:33,220
and then the key one came
in from up here as h minus.

189
00:12:33,580 --> 00:12:36,280
But what you might call this,
uh,

190
00:12:36,760 --> 00:12:41,080
Alpha Keto glutaric acid,
hydrogen A's, right?

191
00:12:41,081 --> 00:12:44,380
The thing that does this,
why is it called dehydrogenase?

192
00:12:44,710 --> 00:12:46,750
Because a catalyst bakes,

193
00:12:46,751 --> 00:12:51,160
the reaction go faster in either
direction and it was first studied in the

194
00:12:51,161 --> 00:12:55,690
direction where it goes from bottom
right, bottom left to top, right, right?

195
00:12:56,230 --> 00:12:58,000
So it's called dehydrogenase.

196
00:12:58,001 --> 00:13:01,480
But the catalyst just makes the
transformation happen in either direction.

197
00:13:03,340 --> 00:13:05,200
Okay.
Now,

198
00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:09,640
once you have an amino acid light
glutamic acid that we got last time,

199
00:13:10,030 --> 00:13:14,770
then you could make other amino acids
by what's called Trans Amination.

200
00:13:15,130 --> 00:13:19,660
So you have a compound like this that
has a ketone in it that reacts with that

201
00:13:20,110 --> 00:13:23,590
Amino Group to form an Emmy.
Right?

202
00:13:24,190 --> 00:13:29,190
And then this thing ultimately comes apart
to go back to the alpha-ketoglutarate

203
00:13:29,191 --> 00:13:33,220
Rick acid. So you sacrifice
having made glutamic acid,

204
00:13:33,221 --> 00:13:37,150
having made this amino acid,
but you get back Alanine,

205
00:13:37,210 --> 00:13:42,130
the one that's ch three here,
c h and h two

206
00:13:43,630 --> 00:13:47,850
right now. What was the key step once
you formed this form? This [inaudible],

207
00:13:49,180 --> 00:13:54,180
what had to happen in order to make it
unzip to make alanine and go back to the

208
00:13:55,991 --> 00:13:59,860
Quito glutaric acid
notice in this first step,

209
00:14:00,040 --> 00:14:01,780
we've made this double bond.

210
00:14:02,980 --> 00:14:07,180
Obviously if we had the double
bond here and a single bond here,

211
00:14:07,990 --> 00:14:10,690
then if we undid the double
bond by adding water,

212
00:14:10,691 --> 00:14:15,130
we'd put the key tone at the
top carbon up here. Right?

213
00:14:15,490 --> 00:14:18,370
And we have the a amino
acid at the bottom.

214
00:14:19,720 --> 00:14:23,920
So what's key is to move the double bond
from here to here and the single bond

215
00:14:23,921 --> 00:14:28,750
from top to bottom. Right. What
kind of rearrangement is that?

216
00:14:30,370 --> 00:14:32,710
Can you think of a name for
a rearrangement like that?

217
00:14:36,070 --> 00:14:39,550
Amy Did you say for
somebody said, Oh, I should.

218
00:14:40,220 --> 00:14:41,660
It's an outlet for you arrangement.

219
00:14:42,110 --> 00:14:47,010
All right, where are you? Say
Take off this, this proton,

220
00:14:47,370 --> 00:14:50,550
which is adjacent to the double
bonds and put it on down here. Okay,

221
00:14:50,551 --> 00:14:53,180
so that's called Trans Amination.
So again,

222
00:14:53,270 --> 00:14:55,760
many other amino acids are not essential.

223
00:14:55,761 --> 00:14:58,190
You don't have to get them in
your diet because you could.

224
00:14:58,220 --> 00:15:02,840
There you have the enzymes that help
make it by transamination. Okay?

225
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:05,870
Now, does anybody recognize
what this fragment is?

226
00:15:05,871 --> 00:15:10,100
It's a fragment of a much bigger molecule.
You know what the bigger molecule is?

227
00:15:11,830 --> 00:15:16,500
Pardon me? I heard
someone say something, Dna

228
00:15:17,870 --> 00:15:22,790
change the DNA. It's a bunch of, it's
here. Here's a stick diagram of it,

229
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:26,120
and it's a bunch of cs in a row,
okay?

230
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:31,190
But let's just look at that bit in the
middle there. All right, and let's, uh,

231
00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:34,970
uh, break the chain here,
these phosphates. And uh,

232
00:15:35,180 --> 00:15:37,820
and so we'll make these o's into ohs here,

233
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:40,810
right?

234
00:15:40,810 --> 00:15:44,860
So there's the key thing
that's in the chain. Now,

235
00:15:45,400 --> 00:15:47,440
there's an interesting
functional group there

236
00:15:50,460 --> 00:15:53,940
that's called Hemi Ama.
Now that functional group,

237
00:15:55,560 --> 00:15:58,620
so it has a nitrogen.
And an oxygen on the carbon.

238
00:16:00,110 --> 00:16:00,943
Right.

239
00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:04,170
Can you, does that remind you
of any other functional groups?

240
00:16:04,670 --> 00:16:05,503
Yeah.

241
00:16:08,080 --> 00:16:11,320
What would the oxygen
analog be if you had,

242
00:16:11,321 --> 00:16:13,900
instead of the nitrogen and oxygen,

243
00:16:18,700 --> 00:16:22,240
what would it be? Yeah, it
would be an asset towel. Right?

244
00:16:23,080 --> 00:16:26,220
And you can see then you could take it
apart. The way you're taking an asset,

245
00:16:26,221 --> 00:16:31,221
tell apart you have an haven't a carbon
eel and here an Nh when you would have

246
00:16:31,391 --> 00:16:34,390
an alcohol and o h if it
were the oxygen analog.

247
00:16:34,750 --> 00:16:39,670
So you have a sugar and the basis
it's called, right. But if that base,

248
00:16:39,671 --> 00:16:43,450
we're an alcohol instead and
then reverse the reaction,

249
00:16:44,110 --> 00:16:45,280
you'd make a key towel.

250
00:16:45,790 --> 00:16:50,590
So the DNA is a whole bunch
of essentially key towels.

251
00:16:50,591 --> 00:16:55,470
They're called Hemi aminals cause it's
at Ama now would be two nitrogens, Akita,

252
00:16:55,530 --> 00:16:59,830
Alice, two oxygens, a Hemi am
unal is a nitrogen and an oxygen.

253
00:16:59,831 --> 00:17:03,820
So you have a whole bunch of these
essentially key towels so that you know,

254
00:17:03,821 --> 00:17:07,330
that's a protecting group for
a sugar. Right? So in a sense,

255
00:17:07,331 --> 00:17:11,170
DNA as a protecting group for sugars,
although it has other uses as well.

256
00:17:13,090 --> 00:17:13,923
Okay.

257
00:17:14,500 --> 00:17:19,500
Now you can also get what's called Alpha
substitution via a really a relative

258
00:17:20,411 --> 00:17:24,850
of, of the amine called INA mean. Okay,

259
00:17:24,851 --> 00:17:29,200
so here we saw before you take the amine,
you've put it together to get the, uh,

260
00:17:29,240 --> 00:17:34,210
m and l or the, the Carbon Ola
mean you have the unshared Perry,

261
00:17:34,211 --> 00:17:39,211
you can lose hydroxide and you get here
and remember what happened before the,

262
00:17:40,001 --> 00:17:42,790
Ooh, mine is took off a
proton to make an [inaudible].

263
00:17:44,260 --> 00:17:48,160
Now you can't do that.
Can you see why you can't make an amine?

264
00:17:49,560 --> 00:17:49,980
Why can't

265
00:17:49,980 --> 00:17:51,150
you make an Emmy in here,

266
00:17:56,610 --> 00:17:57,443
Chris?

267
00:17:59,990 --> 00:18:04,450
The domain is the carbon nitrogen
double bond, but without the charge,

268
00:18:04,930 --> 00:18:09,190
right? Cause you've lost the Proton,
but there's no proton on the nitrogen,

269
00:18:09,910 --> 00:18:13,170
right? Because we've started
with a secondary amine,

270
00:18:13,180 --> 00:18:14,860
one that has to our groups on it.

271
00:18:15,640 --> 00:18:20,500
So you don't have the Proton to take
off from the ammonium ion, right?

272
00:18:21,010 --> 00:18:23,710
But you do have that Proton on the carbon.

273
00:18:24,760 --> 00:18:28,900
And notice that's in the Alpha
position adjacent to the double bond.

274
00:18:29,170 --> 00:18:32,140
And this is very much like a ketone.
In fact,

275
00:18:32,141 --> 00:18:36,880
it's very reactive because the n plus
makes that double bond even more.

276
00:18:37,150 --> 00:18:41,140
Uh, even a lower Lumo the Pi Star, right?

277
00:18:41,350 --> 00:18:44,710
So it's something that's going to be able
to stabilize and electron pair if you

278
00:18:44,711 --> 00:18:48,160
pull that Proton off,
okay, so you, you do that,

279
00:18:48,550 --> 00:18:52,180
the proton gets pulled off by
the hydroxide and you have this,

280
00:18:52,181 --> 00:18:57,100
which is now called an Ian. I
mean it's like an Ian. All right.

281
00:18:58,690 --> 00:19:03,690
Now you can make that in a 90% yield by
driving the equilibrium to the right by

282
00:19:05,051 --> 00:19:07,750
removing the water,
which was the product you just made.

283
00:19:07,751 --> 00:19:09,310
So you distill out the water,

284
00:19:09,670 --> 00:19:13,210
then you can get a very high
a yield of this ina mean,

285
00:19:13,510 --> 00:19:17,170
which it was shown to be a very
useful synthetic intermediate.

286
00:19:17,740 --> 00:19:22,740
And the reason it's useful is the unshared
pair can get involved in making that

287
00:19:22,871 --> 00:19:24,370
carbon nuclear fillic.

288
00:19:24,860 --> 00:19:29,050
Remember we just said that cyanide is
an important synthetic intermediate

289
00:19:29,051 --> 00:19:32,940
because it has a carbon
that's a nucleophile that can
attack another carbon form

290
00:19:32,950 --> 00:19:37,480
of carbon carbon bond in the
striker synthesis of the amino acid.

291
00:19:37,481 --> 00:19:41,450
We saw that, right? But here's
another one that can do, can,

292
00:19:41,500 --> 00:19:46,330
can function as a nucleophile to make
new carbon carbon bonds. Uh, for example,

293
00:19:46,450 --> 00:19:50,950
it can react with an acid chloride,
right?

294
00:19:51,970 --> 00:19:55,600
So it adds addition, uh, association,

295
00:19:55,630 --> 00:19:58,840
and then dissociation of the chloride,
right?

296
00:19:59,410 --> 00:20:03,940
And puts an ACL group on the,
on the Alpha position.

297
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:07,720
Now you can bring water in,
right?

298
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:12,970
And reverse the formation of
the, of the, uh, ammonium ion,

299
00:20:13,570 --> 00:20:18,160
right? And you get what you
see there is a Beta die ketone.

300
00:20:18,520 --> 00:20:22,930
It's two ketone groups, not, not
adjacent to one another, not alpha,

301
00:20:22,931 --> 00:20:26,710
but next adjacent with a carbon
in between a Beta die ketone.

302
00:20:27,010 --> 00:20:30,950
So if you want to synthesize a Beta
die ketone, you can use this reaction.

303
00:20:30,951 --> 00:20:34,370
And in fact, when our
is a c five chain, uh,

304
00:20:34,371 --> 00:20:38,840
this was done in 70% yield. Okay? Uh,

305
00:20:39,370 --> 00:20:44,320
that process is called stork.
Ina Mean Acla nation ACL.

306
00:20:44,321 --> 00:20:46,570
Remember is our c double bond o.

307
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:51,550
So put our c double bond o on the Alpha
position of a ketone. So if you want,

308
00:20:52,010 --> 00:20:56,770
you want the carbon eel grew up here,
you can do make the ENM mean,

309
00:20:56,800 --> 00:20:59,980
then react with an ACL chloride.
Okay?

310
00:21:00,100 --> 00:21:03,490
But that's not the only thing you can
attack with that carbon nucleophile.

311
00:21:04,030 --> 00:21:06,940
You could attack RCL right?

312
00:21:07,450 --> 00:21:11,530
Then that puts an art group
on the Alpha position, right?

313
00:21:11,920 --> 00:21:14,590
Bring in water and hydrolyze
it and you get that.

314
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:18,670
And when our is fennel ch two Benzel,

315
00:21:18,850 --> 00:21:23,200
there's a 50 55% yield of that
purified compound was obtained,

316
00:21:23,710 --> 00:21:26,650
right? But that's not an
ACL elation that anymore.

317
00:21:26,890 --> 00:21:31,210
You're putting our on not RCO.
This is an alkylation.

318
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:36,600
So this is called the stork eno mean ow
culation and there's a much fancier kind

319
00:21:37,091 --> 00:21:41,380
of calculation that was done in
all these are in the same paper.

320
00:21:41,860 --> 00:21:45,940
If you have an Alpha Beta
unsaturated key tone,

321
00:21:46,060 --> 00:21:51,060
so a conjugated ketone right now you can
attack not just not the carbon that has

322
00:21:52,421 --> 00:21:53,770
the double bond o on it,

323
00:21:54,130 --> 00:21:58,120
but you can attack adjacent
to it right to the next,

324
00:21:58,121 --> 00:22:01,780
to the terminal double bond there,
and then form this.

325
00:22:02,740 --> 00:22:04,720
So it would form first that he analyte.

326
00:22:05,620 --> 00:22:08,440
Then since the inlay could
be on the Alpha position,

327
00:22:08,441 --> 00:22:13,441
Proton come in and you've
got that compound so you
can put that fancier Al Kill

328
00:22:14,070 --> 00:22:16,710
Group on, uh, bring in water,

329
00:22:16,740 --> 00:22:21,670
get rid of the helping group there.
And you have this dye ketone

330
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:26,890
now, um, this, these are called stork.

331
00:22:27,250 --> 00:22:29,800
The reason they're called stork
is not because of the bird,

332
00:22:29,801 --> 00:22:34,720
but because of Gilbert's stork shown on
the left there who was the phd adviser

333
00:22:34,721 --> 00:22:38,830
of my neighbor. Uh, Fred
Ziegler, who teaches chem two 20.

334
00:22:39,420 --> 00:22:43,720
Uh, uh, and in fact Storch
was a graduate or uh,

335
00:22:44,260 --> 00:22:48,460
uh, Ziegler was a graduate student in
storks lab just at the time this work was

336
00:22:48,461 --> 00:22:49,294
being done.

337
00:22:49,480 --> 00:22:53,180
So when I went to talk to him about
getting permission to use this picture and

338
00:22:53,181 --> 00:22:55,280
the slideshow,
uh,

339
00:22:55,360 --> 00:22:59,980
he told me some lore about
it that I wasn't aware of
that I think is interesting

340
00:22:59,981 --> 00:23:03,010
for you to know. So here,
remember that there's a lot,

341
00:23:03,040 --> 00:23:06,820
there's an enormous amount of lord
that you just have to be around the way

342
00:23:06,940 --> 00:23:09,910
Ziegler was around or to have used
these things in order to know.

343
00:23:10,420 --> 00:23:14,850
So here was this, we showed this
70% yield of the free del Cra,

344
00:23:14,900 --> 00:23:19,390
the stork, Acla Asian.
Right? But in fact, what,

345
00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:23,950
uh, uh, Ziegler pointed
out to me is to do this,

346
00:23:23,951 --> 00:23:28,420
you need to equivalence of the enemy,
not just one.

347
00:23:29,650 --> 00:23:34,150
Now why do you need two equivalents
rather than just one mole per mole of the,

348
00:23:34,510 --> 00:23:38,530
of the ACL?
Haylight because the first product,

349
00:23:38,531 --> 00:23:42,260
remember before you got rid
of this helping group, uh,

350
00:23:42,440 --> 00:23:46,340
from the Itam mean was that,
and that's a super

351
00:23:46,340 --> 00:23:47,450
carbon steel group,

352
00:23:48,050 --> 00:23:53,050
which means that that hydrogen is Alpha
both to this one and this carbon yield

353
00:23:53,810 --> 00:23:57,560
group. So what property should that
hydrogen have? Unusual property.

354
00:23:58,760 --> 00:24:01,550
Pardon me?
It's very acidic.

355
00:24:01,551 --> 00:24:04,760
The anti on will be very
strongly stabilized, right?

356
00:24:04,761 --> 00:24:09,761
So it'll be easy for it to
dissociate to give h plus right?

357
00:24:10,580 --> 00:24:13,490
Now, can you think of anything
that would be a base in here?

358
00:24:18,320 --> 00:24:22,240
Notice we identified the
INA mean as a nuclear file,

359
00:24:23,750 --> 00:24:27,350
but nuclear files are also basic,
right?

360
00:24:27,830 --> 00:24:32,830
So this product transfers a
proton to a mole of Edo mean,

361
00:24:34,190 --> 00:24:36,830
right?
So that uses a second enemy and up.

362
00:24:36,831 --> 00:24:39,980
So you need to have them if you want
to get the reaction to go. Otherwise,

363
00:24:39,981 --> 00:24:44,300
the first half of the product chews up
the rest of the starting material, right?

364
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:46,400
But there's a cheaper way to do it,

365
00:24:46,610 --> 00:24:51,530
which is to put in some other base
that can eat up the proton. So in fact,

366
00:24:51,531 --> 00:24:55,790
they use triethylamine is
added in to soak up the h plus.

367
00:24:56,750 --> 00:25:01,640
Okay. And that wasn't the only bit
of Lore Ziegler told me about, uh,

368
00:25:01,910 --> 00:25:05,780
this, if you go to Wikipedia
and looked up, uh, you know,

369
00:25:05,790 --> 00:25:10,550
me and alkylation, you'll get this
as an example of what the product is.

370
00:25:10,940 --> 00:25:13,100
But in fact,
that's not the product.

371
00:25:14,600 --> 00:25:19,310
The product is this in 71%
yield from doing this reaction.

372
00:25:21,110 --> 00:25:25,580
So where in the world did that come from?
Well,

373
00:25:25,590 --> 00:25:30,590
remember before we hydrolyze that it was
in that form a supercar video type of

374
00:25:30,981 --> 00:25:34,820
group, right? And now here,

375
00:25:34,850 --> 00:25:37,850
that carbon is Alpha to the carbon eel.

376
00:25:38,180 --> 00:25:40,010
So you can make an eternal eight there.

377
00:25:41,870 --> 00:25:46,870
So now this carbon and I n can
attack Pi Star at that carbon.

378
00:25:48,050 --> 00:25:52,100
So you form a bond from here to here.
Now, of course, in order to reach,

379
00:25:52,101 --> 00:25:55,460
you have to flop this over 180 degrees.
Okay?

380
00:25:56,150 --> 00:26:00,140
So if you do that, then
you get this, right?

381
00:26:00,141 --> 00:26:04,790
This is the new bond that was formed
to the carbon adjacent to the nitrogen,

382
00:26:05,480 --> 00:26:08,000
right?
But notice with this,

383
00:26:08,840 --> 00:26:13,670
you can make an anti in there. Take a
proton off. It's a, it's an analyte.

384
00:26:14,330 --> 00:26:16,070
Where did the,
where would the proton go?

385
00:26:17,630 --> 00:26:17,860
Okay,

386
00:26:17,860 --> 00:26:20,440
go on the nitrogen here.
Right?

387
00:26:21,060 --> 00:26:24,660
And now we have a leaving
group and a nucleophile

388
00:26:27,190 --> 00:26:31,090
and that's the product, right?
Elimination from that compound.

389
00:26:32,050 --> 00:26:35,890
So that's another bit of Lore that you
don't get. What? Wikipedia. Yeah, it's,

390
00:26:35,891 --> 00:26:39,610
you get what stork founding in 1963.

391
00:26:41,950 --> 00:26:44,070
Okay. Now, uh, that's what we want to say

392
00:26:44,070 --> 00:26:48,000
about him means and now onto
oxidation and reduction.

393
00:26:48,360 --> 00:26:52,710
Now this the most straight forward
kind of oxidation reduction oxidation.

394
00:26:52,711 --> 00:26:53,850
Where did the word come from?

395
00:26:57,130 --> 00:26:58,360
What does oxidation

396
00:26:59,890 --> 00:27:04,330
originally who thought of
the term oxidation oxygen.

397
00:27:05,500 --> 00:27:10,500
[inaudible]

398
00:27:16,930 --> 00:27:19,040
the idea that oxygen made things acidic.

399
00:27:21,640 --> 00:27:22,473
Shayla did,

400
00:27:22,860 --> 00:27:26,340
yeah, Shayla discovered some of those
things, but the name came from France,

401
00:27:26,341 --> 00:27:29,250
came to the blood loss.
His colleagues. Okay.

402
00:27:29,251 --> 00:27:33,450
So oxidation was reaction with oxygen,
right?

403
00:27:33,451 --> 00:27:37,050
Which made things acidic.
Where did the word reduction come from?

404
00:27:37,051 --> 00:27:39,780
What's the reduced?
What does reduce mean?

405
00:27:41,130 --> 00:27:41,850
Right?

406
00:27:41,850 --> 00:27:44,910
Duco do Caray and Latin means to lead.

407
00:27:45,510 --> 00:27:48,540
So to it is to lead back again.

408
00:27:49,140 --> 00:27:51,360
So you've gone to oxidation,

409
00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:55,260
you've put oxygen on to
something and then you reduce it,

410
00:27:55,560 --> 00:27:59,310
you lead it back to what it was
originally, take the oxygen off.

411
00:27:59,820 --> 00:28:03,600
When do you think that term originated in?
Where would,

412
00:28:03,780 --> 00:28:08,780
where in technology would you be involved
in removing oxygen from some material?

413
00:28:12,430 --> 00:28:15,970
It's very old.
Thousands of years.

414
00:28:19,660 --> 00:28:23,670
You take a metal oxide,
treat it with a reducing agent,

415
00:28:23,671 --> 00:28:28,350
carbon pull the oxygen, often make
CO2 and you're left with the metal.

416
00:28:28,890 --> 00:28:32,910
That's how you get metal from metallic
whores iron for example. Okay.

417
00:28:32,911 --> 00:28:35,190
So that's what reduces.
Okay.

418
00:28:35,430 --> 00:28:39,870
But nowadays we understand that
in terms of electron transfer,

419
00:28:40,500 --> 00:28:41,130
right?

420
00:28:41,130 --> 00:28:45,810
To oxidize something is to remove
electrons from it to reduce it as to put

421
00:28:45,811 --> 00:28:50,811
electrons on and that those actual
reactions occur in organic chemistry.

422
00:28:51,570 --> 00:28:52,351
For example,

423
00:28:52,351 --> 00:28:57,090
metals are something that are often used
as reducing agents like solid magnesium

424
00:28:57,480 --> 00:29:00,210
and an owl keel.
Haylight can take an electron.

425
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:03,780
Where would the electron go
in Meth into methyl bromide?

426
00:29:03,781 --> 00:29:05,520
If you took an electron out of magnesium,

427
00:29:09,560 --> 00:29:12,870
where's the low Lumo Antonia,

428
00:29:15,880 --> 00:29:16,470
right?

429
00:29:16,470 --> 00:29:21,330
Darcy CBR. So we have reduction
sigma star. So an electron comes out,

430
00:29:21,360 --> 00:29:24,970
we get out of the metal.
So the metal has lost, the,

431
00:29:25,950 --> 00:29:30,150
has lost an electron and the
Ch ch three Br is gained one.

432
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:31,051
What will that,

433
00:29:31,051 --> 00:29:34,860
how will that change the properties of
methyl bromide having an extra electron

434
00:29:34,861 --> 00:29:35,730
in Sigma Star?

435
00:29:40,390 --> 00:29:45,290
In what sense? Reactive. What
specific bond will change?

436
00:29:48,650 --> 00:29:50,380
What do you call sigma star

437
00:29:53,260 --> 00:29:55,430
one kind of more?
Well,

438
00:30:00,670 --> 00:30:01,880
why do you call an antibiotic?

439
00:30:02,220 --> 00:30:06,690
Because it usually breaks last attraction.
So what's going to happen?

440
00:30:07,930 --> 00:30:08,990
So the Bob Burns,

441
00:30:09,750 --> 00:30:12,250
alright, so you get c h three. Dot.

442
00:30:12,520 --> 00:30:16,660
There were three electrons in that
sigma and Sigma Star. Two and sigma,

443
00:30:16,661 --> 00:30:20,830
one in Sigma Star. So now those
three electrons or a pair on bromine,

444
00:30:20,950 --> 00:30:25,630
bromide and a single electron
radical od on nothing,

445
00:30:26,110 --> 00:30:29,380
right? Uh, now you can get, uh,

446
00:30:29,381 --> 00:30:34,060
the magnesium Adam comes
out or May, uh, uh,

447
00:30:34,690 --> 00:30:39,100
uh, and, and reacts with the,
uh, methyl radical to give, uh,

448
00:30:39,340 --> 00:30:42,610
to give the methyl magnesium bromide.

449
00:30:43,390 --> 00:30:48,010
And that's called the green yar reagent
and it behaves a lot like you might

450
00:30:48,011 --> 00:30:50,350
expect ch three minus to behave.

451
00:30:50,351 --> 00:30:54,730
It's a carbon nucleophile and it's a,
it's a strong base,

452
00:30:55,480 --> 00:31:00,190
right? Of course. It's not really
ch three minus. It's actually the,

453
00:31:00,490 --> 00:31:04,120
the, a sigma bond, the sigma
pair of electrons in here.

454
00:31:04,121 --> 00:31:08,530
But because of the magnesium is
not, uh, is so high in energy,

455
00:31:08,531 --> 00:31:09,161
it's orbitals.

456
00:31:09,161 --> 00:31:13,450
This is an unusually high homo and we've
talked about it before and lithium can

457
00:31:13,451 --> 00:31:17,050
do the same thing that magnesium did here.
Okay.

458
00:31:17,290 --> 00:31:19,870
Green Yard got a very early Nobel prize,

459
00:31:19,990 --> 00:31:24,160
not a 19 eight or something
like this because it,

460
00:31:24,180 --> 00:31:29,180
because it was so useful to have
ways to make Al Keel nuclear files in

461
00:31:29,561 --> 00:31:33,400
synthesis. Okay. 1912. Pardon
me. He got the Nobel prize.

462
00:31:34,270 --> 00:31:39,100
Okay. Now another example is a ketone.
So you can, it can react with magnesium.

463
00:31:39,340 --> 00:31:42,280
Now where will the electron
go? Roll. What are you saying?

464
00:31:44,480 --> 00:31:47,260
What's the,
what's the low low low acid?

465
00:31:49,900 --> 00:31:54,530
Put an electron in Pi Star.
Okay.

466
00:31:55,130 --> 00:31:59,570
So now we can write that as a charge
on oxygen and the radical on carbon.

467
00:31:59,970 --> 00:32:03,260
It doesn't break the bond because
there was a double bond to begin with.

468
00:32:03,261 --> 00:32:06,800
So it's just the s but we went
down to a single bond. Now, okay,

469
00:32:06,801 --> 00:32:09,500
now you can do that with another,
uh,

470
00:32:09,590 --> 00:32:12,860
acetone on the surface of
the magnesium and get that.

471
00:32:13,430 --> 00:32:17,270
And now you have magnesium
double plus between them, right?

472
00:32:18,020 --> 00:32:21,260
But now since the two are
attached to the same magnesium,

473
00:32:22,040 --> 00:32:26,270
the radicals can react with one another,
right?

474
00:32:26,271 --> 00:32:30,560
To make a bond. And if you then add
water to put protons on the Ohs,

475
00:32:32,160 --> 00:32:34,970
right?
You can get pinnacle.

476
00:32:35,540 --> 00:32:38,630
And this is called the pinnacle reduction,
right?

477
00:32:39,320 --> 00:32:43,310
And we've seen before that if
you treat pin a call with h plus,

478
00:32:43,311 --> 00:32:44,510
you'll get Pinnock alone.

479
00:32:47,090 --> 00:32:50,960
So here are two examples of
reducing an organic compound,

480
00:32:51,740 --> 00:32:54,590
actually by electron transfer,
right?

481
00:32:54,860 --> 00:32:57,320
But much more often in organic chemistry.

482
00:32:57,500 --> 00:33:00,350
We're not talking about
actual electron transfers,

483
00:33:00,620 --> 00:33:05,000
we're just using it as a
bookkeeping scheme right now.

484
00:33:05,001 --> 00:33:07,640
What do we want to keep books about?
We,

485
00:33:07,730 --> 00:33:12,170
we arbitrarily assigned
shared electron pairs.

486
00:33:12,171 --> 00:33:16,160
We know from last semester the nature
of a bond and how electron pairs get

487
00:33:16,161 --> 00:33:19,160
shared.
But for bookkeeping purposes,

488
00:33:19,340 --> 00:33:24,340
we pretend that if there's a
bond between two different atoms,

489
00:33:25,010 --> 00:33:29,600
it's an ionic bond and those two
electrons for bookkeeping purposes,

490
00:33:29,780 --> 00:33:32,330
even though they're practically 50,
50 shared,

491
00:33:32,570 --> 00:33:35,690
we assign them to the more
electronegative as the two elements.

492
00:33:36,410 --> 00:33:40,190
There's nothing realistic about,
this is just the scheme for bookkeeping,

493
00:33:40,700 --> 00:33:43,010
but it turns out to be
handy as you will see.

494
00:33:44,180 --> 00:33:47,340
So let's look at these at these two comp,

495
00:33:47,460 --> 00:33:51,350
these two at the ketone
and the alcohol here,

496
00:33:51,950 --> 00:33:56,950
and let's figure out what the oxidation
states of the various atoms are.

497
00:33:59,210 --> 00:34:01,120
Right? So let's start. Uh,

498
00:34:01,220 --> 00:34:06,220
so we're just doing bookkeeping
here and I'll tell you why.

499
00:34:07,280 --> 00:34:11,870
It's because it will be very helpful
in choosing reagents or remembering

500
00:34:11,871 --> 00:34:13,250
reagents,
right?

501
00:34:13,640 --> 00:34:18,140
Because we've classified reagents as
homos and Lumos and what they can react

502
00:34:18,141 --> 00:34:22,100
with. But there's a completely
different way of classifying reagents,

503
00:34:22,101 --> 00:34:26,450
not as having unusually high homos are
unusually low lumos or both or neither.

504
00:34:27,350 --> 00:34:31,670
But you can classify them as to whether
they're oxidizing or reducing agents.

505
00:34:32,660 --> 00:34:36,560
And a good reason. So you have
lots of, when you think of,

506
00:34:36,561 --> 00:34:38,810
I need to make a transformation
from here to here,

507
00:34:38,811 --> 00:34:40,190
I'd have to choose the reagent.

508
00:34:41,030 --> 00:34:45,470
It could be very helpful if
you can exclude two thirds
of the reagents and think

509
00:34:45,471 --> 00:34:46,790
only about the others,

510
00:34:47,480 --> 00:34:52,430
or if you're trying to design a new
reagent to design it sensibly so that it

511
00:34:52,431 --> 00:34:55,670
could plausibly give this transformation,
right?

512
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:59,060
So you can think about homos
and lumos would we do do that.

513
00:34:59,120 --> 00:35:01,490
When we tried to think,
for example, for a ketone,

514
00:35:01,491 --> 00:35:06,050
we'd think of having a high homo to attack
the carbon eel or a little Lumo like

515
00:35:06,051 --> 00:35:09,620
a proton to protonate the oxygen.
That's mechanistic thought,

516
00:35:10,190 --> 00:35:15,190
but we can throw out two thirds of the
candidates if we think about oxidation

517
00:35:15,861 --> 00:35:18,890
and reduction. So that's why
this bookkeeping scheme is handy.

518
00:35:19,280 --> 00:35:23,210
So let's look first at this carbon and
I'll get, I'll start you out here. Okay.

519
00:35:23,211 --> 00:35:27,890
So this carbon has a bond to carbon.
Now that's a carbon carbon bond,

520
00:35:28,550 --> 00:35:32,270
right? So one electron came from
the carbon. We're talking about.

521
00:35:32,271 --> 00:35:35,510
One came from the other carbon,
but we now split it.

522
00:35:35,780 --> 00:35:38,370
50 50 cents said the electronegativity.

523
00:35:38,670 --> 00:35:43,230
So this carbon neither lost nor gained
in electron by forming the carbon carbon

524
00:35:43,231 --> 00:35:46,680
bond. But it also formed
three bonds to hydrogen.

525
00:35:47,580 --> 00:35:52,380
Now carbon is more electronegative
than hydrogen, right?

526
00:35:52,680 --> 00:35:57,630
So those three pairs, each of them has
one electron that came from carbon.

527
00:35:58,140 --> 00:36:02,100
One Electron came from hydrogen,
but for bookkeeping purposes,

528
00:36:02,101 --> 00:36:03,510
we assigned them to carbon.

529
00:36:04,830 --> 00:36:09,690
So now carbon has three electrons
that it didn't come in with, right?

530
00:36:09,691 --> 00:36:14,460
It came in with four shared one with
another carbon bookkeeping. Keep that one,

531
00:36:14,970 --> 00:36:17,880
but not the other one.
Made three bonds to hydrogen.

532
00:36:17,881 --> 00:36:22,410
Get an electron from each of those so
that carbon has an oxidation state of

533
00:36:22,411 --> 00:36:26,610
minus three is everybody.
See how we did that? Okay,

534
00:36:26,611 --> 00:36:29,220
so if we see that,
now tell me what the next carbon is.

535
00:36:29,221 --> 00:36:31,590
What should its oxidation State v

536
00:36:33,810 --> 00:36:38,020
Roy
second car.

537
00:36:38,100 --> 00:36:38,970
Then from the left.

538
00:36:39,670 --> 00:36:42,690
Yeah.
What box does it too?

539
00:36:44,650 --> 00:36:46,030
How many carbon carbon bonds.

540
00:36:46,320 --> 00:36:51,320
[inaudible]

541
00:36:57,070 --> 00:36:58,270
carbon carbon bonds.

542
00:36:58,330 --> 00:37:01,120
Both of them split the electrons
since it's the same element.

543
00:37:01,630 --> 00:37:02,860
So what should its oxidation

544
00:37:02,870 --> 00:37:06,520
level? B. Z. Okay. How about the next one?

545
00:37:08,100 --> 00:37:13,100
[inaudible] carbon

546
00:37:17,690 --> 00:37:21,810
to bonds. To oxygen. Yeah.
And those electrons go to who?

547
00:37:24,300 --> 00:37:25,350
Those went to oxygen.

548
00:37:25,350 --> 00:37:28,500
Those two electrons of carbon went
to oxygen. So what's the carbon

549
00:37:29,870 --> 00:37:30,960
plus?
Okay.

550
00:37:31,570 --> 00:37:36,570
How about the next carbon [inaudible]

551
00:37:41,140 --> 00:37:46,000
again, like the methyls on the left.
Okay, now let's look at the right.

552
00:37:46,390 --> 00:37:49,570
That one's minus three. How
about the next one? Yeah,

553
00:37:50,480 --> 00:37:54,610
that's zero. How do you, how
would you answer so quickly here?

554
00:37:55,730 --> 00:37:58,980
Right? So that one zero.
How about the next one?

555
00:38:00,630 --> 00:38:01,463
Zero.

556
00:38:01,620 --> 00:38:05,880
Zero because it was minus one
with respect to the hydrogen,

557
00:38:05,881 --> 00:38:09,950
but plus one with respect to the
oxygen. So it's zero. And finally,

558
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:18,650
now notice that almost all of these
were the same left and right. So we,

559
00:38:18,651 --> 00:38:21,920
we're really wasting our time except
for getting some practice and doing

560
00:38:21,921 --> 00:38:23,900
everything except the ones that changed.

561
00:38:24,200 --> 00:38:28,340
So you look at the elements
that change their bonds, right?

562
00:38:28,341 --> 00:38:29,270
To see what happened.

563
00:38:29,630 --> 00:38:34,630
And if we do that now we see that only
this one and this one changed and it

564
00:38:34,761 --> 00:38:39,700
changed plus two to zero.
So it got reduced.

565
00:38:40,690 --> 00:38:44,920
Okay. So that question mark, now
we know is that's a reduction.

566
00:38:45,250 --> 00:38:48,880
So we had to choose a reducing agent,
right?

567
00:38:49,450 --> 00:38:54,450
So now if we had a way of classifying
reagents as being oxidizing or reducing or

568
00:38:56,020 --> 00:38:58,330
neither,
then we would know.

569
00:38:58,331 --> 00:39:02,500
We would only have to look among reducing
agents if we want to do this reaction,

570
00:39:02,710 --> 00:39:06,610
unless the reaction might be a really
complicated thing where you do an

571
00:39:06,611 --> 00:39:10,600
oxidation and then two
reductions or something like
that. But for simple things,

572
00:39:10,840 --> 00:39:14,080
it should be a reducing agent.
Okay,

573
00:39:14,380 --> 00:39:19,060
so let's try some elements are so some
compounds and see whether we would expect

574
00:39:19,061 --> 00:39:23,500
them to be oxidizing or
reducing or neither. Okay,

575
00:39:23,501 --> 00:39:26,920
so let's start with hcl.
There's a good reagent. Now,

576
00:39:26,921 --> 00:39:31,020
what's the oxidation state
of hydrogen in this? There

577
00:39:32,290 --> 00:39:35,150
it hcl. We'll see oxidation.
State of hydrogen.

578
00:39:38,180 --> 00:39:40,430
Pardon me?
It's plus one

579
00:39:40,450 --> 00:39:44,200
because it's sharing. It's got, it's
shared its electron with chlorine.

580
00:39:44,230 --> 00:39:48,730
That means for bookkeeping purposes that
gave it to chlorine and so hydrogens

581
00:39:48,731 --> 00:39:50,800
plus one. How about chlorine? Chris

582
00:39:52,250 --> 00:39:53,083
minus.

583
00:39:53,200 --> 00:39:57,400
Now, what would those be if
they were in organic compounds?

584
00:39:57,401 --> 00:39:59,980
If they were attached to carbon,
what would hydrogen be?

585
00:39:59,981 --> 00:40:01,240
If it were attached to carbon,

586
00:40:04,450 --> 00:40:07,620
it would be plus one. What would
chloride be if it were attached?

587
00:40:07,621 --> 00:40:11,150
Chlorine for attached department.
Okay, so these have there

588
00:40:11,270 --> 00:40:14,540
normal oxidation levels,
right?

589
00:40:14,541 --> 00:40:19,541
HCL has the same oxidation level for
agency L as as if they were attached to

590
00:40:19,611 --> 00:40:24,560
carbon. So it's neither oxidized in nor
reducing if it goes into carbon. Right?

591
00:40:24,561 --> 00:40:28,250
So that's neither. Okay. Okay.

592
00:40:28,251 --> 00:40:31,910
Now let's take br two of Poli.

593
00:40:32,870 --> 00:40:35,300
What's the,
what's the oxidation level

594
00:40:35,780 --> 00:40:38,750
of bromine in br two and elemental girl,

595
00:40:40,750 --> 00:40:45,520
I can't hear. Yeah, they're both zero.

596
00:40:45,570 --> 00:40:47,400
They shared a pair,
but they get it 50,

597
00:40:47,401 --> 00:40:50,760
50 for bookkeeping because they're the
same element. So they're both zero.

598
00:40:50,840 --> 00:40:54,990
That one zero. That one. Zero. Okay. Now
what if they were attached to carbon?

599
00:40:54,991 --> 00:40:55,824
What would they be?

600
00:40:57,600 --> 00:40:58,570
Why this one

601
00:40:58,920 --> 00:41:03,390
take electrons from carbon,
those atoms in bromine, right?

602
00:41:03,690 --> 00:41:05,820
So are they oxidizing or reducing

603
00:41:05,820 --> 00:41:10,460
the agents?
Is Br to oxidizing or reducing?

604
00:41:10,970 --> 00:41:12,490
If it reacts with Carbon Carbon,

605
00:41:12,490 --> 00:41:16,870
it'll take electrons from carbon
for our bookkeeping purposes, right?

606
00:41:17,530 --> 00:41:22,300
So it's a reducing agent. It takes
the electrons away, right? It, it,

607
00:41:22,301 --> 00:41:27,280
uh, uh, our part to say the wrong
thing. It's an oxidizing agent.

608
00:41:27,460 --> 00:41:31,340
Okay. It takes electrons
away. Go ahead. It, uh,

609
00:41:31,510 --> 00:41:35,270
it makes the carbon become plus.
Okay.

610
00:41:35,630 --> 00:41:40,190
So B r two as an oxidizing agent and
we've already seen of course be to act as

611
00:41:40,191 --> 00:41:43,460
an oxidizing agent. For example,
it reacts with ethylene.

612
00:41:43,610 --> 00:41:46,310
What's the oxidation level
of carbon and ethylene?

613
00:41:48,470 --> 00:41:51,500
Well,
what do you say in ch two ch two.

614
00:41:51,950 --> 00:41:54,150
What's the oxidation
level of the carbon out?

615
00:41:54,340 --> 00:41:55,173
Yes,

616
00:41:56,610 --> 00:41:58,470
there are two bonds.
Carbon to carbon,

617
00:41:59,190 --> 00:42:02,820
but those don't take electrons away or
give electrons. Right? Cause it's saint.

618
00:42:03,090 --> 00:42:05,400
But there are two bonds to
hydrogen on each carbon.

619
00:42:07,410 --> 00:42:08,350
Hydrogen done squat,

620
00:42:08,880 --> 00:42:09,750
current bookkeeping,

621
00:42:11,740 --> 00:42:14,810
we consider the bond
ionic for bookkeeping,

622
00:42:15,230 --> 00:42:17,330
h plus c minus.

623
00:42:17,570 --> 00:42:22,370
So the carbon got an electron from the,
from each hydrogen.

624
00:42:22,700 --> 00:42:26,390
Right? So what should its oxidation
level via up the carbon on the left.

625
00:42:31,060 --> 00:42:33,590
Okay. And same on there.
Right now we've, we,

626
00:42:33,600 --> 00:42:38,600
we went through homos Lumos and so on
and saw how it reacts with how it reacts

627
00:42:38,801 --> 00:42:42,160
with Brahmi. Remember Bro ammonium
ion bromide comes in and so on.

628
00:42:42,161 --> 00:42:43,150
That's the mechanism.

629
00:42:44,380 --> 00:42:49,380
But for purposes of oxidation
reduction there now minus a minus one,

630
00:42:50,710 --> 00:42:53,740
right? Because the bromine
canceled one of the hydrogens.

631
00:42:54,460 --> 00:42:57,580
So we went from minus two
on each carbon to minus one.

632
00:42:57,970 --> 00:43:02,970
So if we want to go from ethylene
to die Bromo F to to die x ethylene,

633
00:43:04,630 --> 00:43:07,000
right?
We need a,

634
00:43:07,060 --> 00:43:12,060
we need an oxidizing agent like Vr to
not be our minus sodium bromide isn't

635
00:43:12,941 --> 00:43:16,510
going to do it. It has to be
br zero. That's going to do it.

636
00:43:17,010 --> 00:43:21,010
And he did an oxidized. Now
how about ch four? What's the,

637
00:43:21,050 --> 00:43:24,790
what's the oxidation state
of carbon and ch four

638
00:43:26,320 --> 00:43:29,020
Amy. Okay. That's minus four.

639
00:43:29,170 --> 00:43:31,880
And the hydrogens are all maybe

640
00:43:33,430 --> 00:43:38,200
plus one for each of
those, right? So those, uh,

641
00:43:38,380 --> 00:43:43,210
now should that be oxidized? Reduced?
Well, certainly it, it, it reduces oxygen.

642
00:43:43,270 --> 00:43:44,103
O Two,

643
00:43:44,380 --> 00:43:49,180
what reaction do you call it when
you reduce a o two with methane?

644
00:43:50,770 --> 00:43:51,603
What do you call it?

645
00:43:55,390 --> 00:43:58,140
Call Fire,
right?

646
00:43:58,730 --> 00:44:02,010
You got see co two and water.
Okay.

647
00:44:02,190 --> 00:44:06,270
You can reduce Effie two oh three at
great heat. That's the original reduction.

648
00:44:06,271 --> 00:44:10,980
Getting a metal from the metal oxide.
You can react it with br two and free.

649
00:44:10,981 --> 00:44:13,350
Radical halogenation.
Right.

650
00:44:13,890 --> 00:44:18,720
But generally methane is not very
reactive except under very special

651
00:44:18,721 --> 00:44:20,880
circumstances.
It doesn't have a homo Lubo,

652
00:44:21,030 --> 00:44:25,320
but we could classify it as a
reducing agent sensibly. Right?

653
00:44:26,280 --> 00:44:29,160
Okay. How about lithium aluminum? Hydride

654
00:44:30,900 --> 00:44:34,770
so this is assault l I plus,
right?

655
00:44:34,980 --> 00:44:36,810
So lithium is in what state?

656
00:44:37,710 --> 00:44:42,250
It's obvious plus one right now.
Aluminum,

657
00:44:43,750 --> 00:44:47,800
aluminum, uh, is, is uh,

658
00:44:48,800 --> 00:44:53,450
is forming three is forming
for bonds to hydrogen.

659
00:44:56,640 --> 00:45:00,630
Now how are we going to do that?
Okay.

660
00:45:01,130 --> 00:45:06,130
What we can regard this as is aluminum
plus three and one of the hydrogens,

661
00:45:08,050 --> 00:45:13,010
hydrogens all being minus one,
right?

662
00:45:13,670 --> 00:45:16,910
Except that we also have a
minus charge there, right?

663
00:45:16,970 --> 00:45:21,970
So the aluminum would be plus four with
four hydrogens because hydride is more

664
00:45:22,581 --> 00:45:24,050
electronegative than aluminum.

665
00:45:24,440 --> 00:45:28,640
So the aluminum would be plus four
with respect to the four hydrogens,

666
00:45:29,210 --> 00:45:34,160
right? But then there's an extra
electron. It's all h four minus.

667
00:45:34,280 --> 00:45:37,970
So that we put on the aluminum
and we have a all three.

668
00:45:39,020 --> 00:45:44,020
Now, uh, what is, what's an abnormal? Uh,

669
00:45:44,320 --> 00:45:47,660
aluminum is a metal,
not very electronegative.

670
00:45:47,960 --> 00:45:52,460
So we had expects the B plus try
[inaudible] plus three. That's reasonable.

671
00:45:52,910 --> 00:45:55,850
What element here is unnatural?

672
00:45:56,510 --> 00:45:59,600
That is not what it would be
if associated with carbon.

673
00:46:01,820 --> 00:46:05,110
Yeah. Hydrogen. It's h

674
00:46:05,180 --> 00:46:08,300
minus, not h plus. Right.

675
00:46:08,630 --> 00:46:13,550
So that's going to make this a reducing
agent because of the h minus. Okay.

676
00:46:14,030 --> 00:46:16,730
How about sodium hydride
there's an easier one,

677
00:46:19,040 --> 00:46:19,700
Carl.

678
00:46:19,700 --> 00:46:24,560
What's the oxidation state of sodium
in this plus one plus one and hydrogen

679
00:46:25,520 --> 00:46:26,190
minus one.

680
00:46:26,190 --> 00:46:27,150
What's unnatural?

681
00:46:29,330 --> 00:46:29,930
Hydrogen.

682
00:46:29,930 --> 00:46:34,610
So reducing agent. Okay.
How about potassium? Metal?

683
00:46:36,730 --> 00:46:39,520
Nathan, what do you say?
What's it's 10 potassium metal.

684
00:46:39,521 --> 00:46:43,600
What's the oxidation state of Gassy.
So you're okay.

685
00:46:43,840 --> 00:46:47,740
Is that what it is with respect to carbon?
If you had a potassium carbon bond,

686
00:46:50,090 --> 00:46:50,923
what would it be?

687
00:46:53,570 --> 00:46:57,190
It would be plus wonderful. It's
carbon. It's less elected. I you

688
00:46:57,210 --> 00:47:00,210
living carbon.
So is that an oxidizing or reducing agent?

689
00:47:02,500 --> 00:47:06,440
No, it's able to give up an electronic
right to go from zero to one

690
00:47:06,500 --> 00:47:11,120
plus one. So that's another
reducing agent. How about KCLS?

691
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:13,910
Hey, can help us with that. What's pay

692
00:47:16,220 --> 00:47:17,990
plus one and chloride?

693
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:21,590
What are they with respect to carbon?

694
00:47:25,010 --> 00:47:26,160
So where should we put it?

695
00:47:30,640 --> 00:47:35,460
Oxidizing. Reducing or amazing. Okay.

696
00:47:36,140 --> 00:47:36,680
Uh,

697
00:47:36,680 --> 00:47:38,630
well,
our s s are,

698
00:47:42,270 --> 00:47:44,280
what's the oxidation state of sulfur?

699
00:47:48,870 --> 00:47:52,950
Sulfur is more electronegative for
these bookkeeping purposes than carbon.

700
00:47:53,700 --> 00:47:56,710
Okay.
So with respect to that

701
00:47:57,750 --> 00:47:59,550
sulfur carbon bond,

702
00:48:00,460 --> 00:48:04,710
that it's more electronegative it
would be minus one. How about sulfur?

703
00:48:04,711 --> 00:48:05,544
Sulfur bonds.

704
00:48:07,050 --> 00:48:09,960
So your role, so what is it? The salt?

705
00:48:11,660 --> 00:48:13,040
It's minus one.
Okay.

706
00:48:13,210 --> 00:48:17,110
Same for the other one now.
Uh,

707
00:48:17,260 --> 00:48:20,860
so that's an oxidizing agent because
of or associated with two carbons,

708
00:48:20,861 --> 00:48:24,520
it would be minus two.
It would get an electron from carbon.

709
00:48:25,060 --> 00:48:29,280
So as compared to, uh, so
as compared to our SSR,

710
00:48:29,850 --> 00:48:34,540
right? O R S R it's, it's
a, an oxidizing agent.

711
00:48:34,900 --> 00:48:39,190
So it oxidizes things like r two r s h is,

712
00:48:39,460 --> 00:48:41,860
could be oxidized by tea,

713
00:48:41,920 --> 00:48:46,840
can be oxidized to this by this.
So r s h is,

714
00:48:46,841 --> 00:48:50,650
uh, is, is a reducing agent, right?

715
00:48:50,680 --> 00:48:54,880
In that reaction and that reaction,
it's a reducing agent.

716
00:48:55,150 --> 00:48:56,650
Did you ever see such a reaction?

717
00:49:01,300 --> 00:49:04,260
Pardon me? Yeah, that's all fine.

718
00:49:04,390 --> 00:49:07,090
Bridges are the permanent waves and hair,
right,

719
00:49:07,091 --> 00:49:09,070
with exactly the reaction
that we talked about.

720
00:49:09,280 --> 00:49:12,280
We talked about it then Homo Lumo terms.
But you know,

721
00:49:12,281 --> 00:49:16,600
in order to make the dye sulfide bridge,
you need an oxidizing agent.

722
00:49:16,660 --> 00:49:21,370
Something has to be the oxidizing
agent, and it could be this. Okay.

723
00:49:22,570 --> 00:49:26,980
Uh, cro three. Uh, I think
I just have two more here.

724
00:49:26,981 --> 00:49:31,510
Let me finish it. That's plus
six. Okay. That's minus two. Okay.

725
00:49:31,750 --> 00:49:36,370
Now there's also a stabili unlike
this where it's cr plus four,

726
00:49:36,630 --> 00:49:40,090
so cr plus six can become cr plus four.

727
00:49:40,510 --> 00:49:43,690
That means it's an oxidizing agent,
cro three.

728
00:49:44,470 --> 00:49:48,070
And we can put it over there. Okay. Water.

729
00:49:48,730 --> 00:49:52,240
Those are the normal oxidation
level plus one minus two.

730
00:49:52,660 --> 00:49:57,250
So it's neither except, uh, well, no,

731
00:49:57,251 --> 00:50:01,180
actually let's, let's quit it here.
We can carry on next Monday. Okay.
