what I'm realizing at you serve a

what I'm realizing at you serve a

00:09:08.100 --> 00:09:09.590 align:start position:0%
difference between this one the next one
and<00:09:08.430><c> again</c><00:09:08.670><c> maybe</c><00:09:08.880><c> it's</c><00:09:09.120><c> building</c><00:09:09.390><c> up</c><00:09:09.450><c> to</c>

00:09:09.590 --> 00:09:09.600 align:start position:0%
and again maybe it's building up to
 

00:09:09.600 --> 00:09:11.570 align:start position:0%
and again maybe it's building up to
something<00:09:09.630><c> but</c><00:09:10.140><c> with</c><00:09:10.590><c> the</c><00:09:10.740><c> first</c><00:09:10.980><c> season</c><00:09:11.250><c> that</c>

00:09:11.570 --> 00:09:11.580 align:start position:0%

00:13:30.690 --> 00:13:30.700 align:start position:0%
seems to me in this may be because of
 

00:13:30.700 --> 00:13:32.700 align:start position:0%
seems to me in this may be because of
