00:00:00.165 --> 00:00:02.725
 2 to 6 percent of people describe themselves as 

00:00:02.725 --> 00:00:05.155
 They have an attraction factor for homosexuality 

00:00:05.155 --> 00:00:08.455
 While there are many social and political theories about why, 

00:00:08.455 --> 00:00:11.575
 What does science say? Is homosexuality genetic, 

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:13.440
 If so, do we all have a homosexuality gene? 

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:16.860
 In the 1990s, two studies using the Human Genome Project 

00:00:16.860 --> 00:00:21.060
 I found that paraplegic men had more equal relatives than men of heterosexuals 

00:00:21.065 --> 00:00:24.035
 And gay brothers have similar ties 

00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:27.045
 On the X chromosome, demonstrating a high level of genetic inheritance. 

00:00:27.045 --> 00:00:29.140
 A recent study of more than four hundred and nine 

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:31.580
 Equivalent siblings also found links in a particular area 

00:00:31.585 --> 00:00:34.815
 Of X chromosome labeled Xq28 

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:37.220
 And in another area of ​​chromosome 8. 

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:40.515
 Moreover the 2014 analysis of fifty years of research 

00:00:40.515 --> 00:00:43.325
 The two men found that they were more likely to have twin brothers 

00:00:43.325 --> 00:00:46.265
 Compared with the possibility of heterosexual men and lesbians 

00:00:46.265 --> 00:00:48.860
 Lesbian sisters, suggesting their qualities are 

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:50.340
 Genetically linked. 

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:53.160
 But, if homosexuality, in fact, hereditary, 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:54.700
 Does not this create a paradox? 

00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:56.420
 While some people like sex, they still have children, 

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:58.800
 Overall they have children 80% 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:00.300
 Of the variants 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:03.620
 Does not it mean that the genes will not pass and disappear in the end? 

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:06.480
 Well, a recent study by the University of California uses epigenetics 

00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:09.080
 To suggest that everyone has a homeopathic gene, 

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:12.280
 But whether the Methyl group facility is specified or not 

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:15.320
 DNA zones are turned on and converted. 

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:17.880
 Genetics is a study of how your environment is 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:19.840
 It can chemically modify your genes. 

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:22.160
 Such as how to diet for the queen of ants and phyromons 

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:24.580
 Chemically the fetal ants can either be chemically altered 

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:25.900
 Soldier or ant worker 

00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:27.800
 Based on what is required of the colony. 

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:30.520
 The twin study was used, one of them being gay and the other different 

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:33.580
 And found that a certain methyl pattern is closely related 

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:35.100
 To sexual orientation. 

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:39.060
 The model was able to predict sexual orientation in men accurately 70% 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:41.420
 But these data used a small subset of people, 

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:43.540
 There is some controversy about research. 

00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:47.620
 In the end, certain gay genes were not found, but scientific evidence 

00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:50.120
 Suggest that sexual orientation is human 

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:53.820
 It is strongly linked to genetics and is tightly regulated at the molecular level. 

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:56.220
 So it was found that the birth of a son 

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:59.120
 Increases the likelihood of homosexuality in the next son 

00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:02.100
 33% for the population. 

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:06.095
 If the older brother of a different mother, there is no effect. 

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:08.820
 This has prompted some researchers to believe that male pregnancy 

00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:12.080
 Leading to a biological mechanism that affects the successive birth of the mother. 

00:02:12.085 --> 00:02:14.565
 A meta-analysis was found 

00:02:14.565 --> 00:02:16.720
 Statistically, gay men 

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:19.420
 They have older brothers than heterosexuals. 

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:23.140
 Another study found women who were exposed to high levels of testosterone in their womb 

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:25.620
 They have higher rates to be different. 

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:27.280
 Why does this happen? 

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:31.420
 The hypothesis of homosexuality suggests that homosexual family members who do not reproduce 

00:02:31.425 --> 00:02:34.305
 Are still increasing the spread of their family genes 

00:02:34.305 --> 00:02:35.460
 In future generations 

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:38.680
 By helping to provide resources for the offspring to which they are associated 

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:43.680
 But the family is correct. 

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:46.540
 Studies also show that there are lower levels of hostility 

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:48.780
 Higher levels of emotional intelligence, 

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:50.760
 Mercy and cooperation in the two men, 

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:54.400
 Which may also increase altruism and survival in human groups. 

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:57.600
 Another hypothesis suggests that genes are homosexuality 

00:02:57.600 --> 00:02:59.720
 Are the ultimate codec to attract 

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:03.200
 This means female relatives of the two men who share the same gene 

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:05.200
 They will also have strong attraction factors for men, 

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:07.495
 Providing an evolutionary advantage. 

00:03:07.495 --> 00:03:10.945
 Studies have shown that these females have more children on average. 

00:03:10.945 --> 00:03:13.895
 The same is true for lesbians and their opposite male relatives 

00:03:13.895 --> 00:03:16.425
 World famous EO Wilson once said 

00:03:16.425 --> 00:03:18.780
 "Homeopathy gives advantages to the group. 

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:22.020
 The community that condemns homosexuality condemns itself. " 

00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:25.240
 Historically, science has not been good for the Quer population. 

00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:27.180
 In the past, it was generally accepted that 

00:03:27.185 --> 00:03:30.185
 The bodies and minds of the two were under pressure to be 

00:03:30.185 --> 00:03:33.375
 From a lower status, with a popular belief that gay behavior 

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:35.500
 It was the result of flawed development. 

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:39.280
 Even some LGBTQ + community are afraid of this scientific research 

00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:43.020
 It can be used to hurt people 

00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:45.700
 Even from the available research, it is clear that most 

00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:49.040
 Just focus on gay men and neglect other groups. 

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:53.120
 But more research on genetic and genetic factors about homosexuality 

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:55.560
 Will reduce anti-homelong laws around the world 

00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:57.940
 By proving that homosexuality is not a choice 

00:03:57.940 --> 00:04:01.340
 But, genetically, can we get rid of homosexuality? 

00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:05.380
 Watch the second video where we discuss whether it's possible and its implications 

00:04:05.380 --> 00:04:07.180
 Of the ongoing study in this field.
