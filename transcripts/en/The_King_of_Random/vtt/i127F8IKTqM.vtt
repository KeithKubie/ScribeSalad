00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:02.820
Hey guys!, i'm Nate welcome back to the workshop not too long ago

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:08.639
We made a video showing you how to make a copy of a vinyl record using a silicone mold and some resin i used two

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:12.179
types of resin for that experiment the first of which i didn't put in a vacuum chamber

00:00:12.340 --> 00:00:17.069
Because i explained that it cured so quickly it wouldn't have time to de gas off the bubbles

00:00:17.199 --> 00:00:19.199
well that made a lot of you curious i guess

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:25.439
Because several people commented saying that they wanted to see what happens if we put that resin in the vacuum chamber so that's what we're

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:26.289
gonna
try out today!

00:00:26.289 --> 00:00:28.499
we've got my quick setting two-part resin

00:00:28.599 --> 00:00:33.328
We'll pour it off into a cup mix it up and then we'll put it in the vacuum chamber and see what happens if we

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:35.329
let it cure while it's in a vacuum

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:41.579
we have our vacuum chamber and we have our resin so let's get started i'll be mixing up our residents and clear plastic cups with

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:47.669
Some popsicle sticks and i also have these paper plates which i've cut to fit inside our vacuum chamber these are gonna go down at

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:52.590
the bottom of the vacuum chamber that's just in case any of our resins fills up over the edges of the cup it won't bond

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:56.969
permanently to the glass of our vacuum chamber it'll just be stuck to these disposable paper plates instead

00:00:57.250 --> 00:00:58.180
cups should balance

00:00:58.180 --> 00:01:02.969
Nicely in the middle of that and hopefully if we do have any spillage it'll land on the plate and not on the glass

00:01:03.729 --> 00:01:09.749
to start with for our equal amounts of each half of our resin now before i put these in a vacuum chamber just as an

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:15.449
Example so we can see what changes let's just pour one half into the other mix it up and let it cure in the cups

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:22.170
this is actually quite a lot of this resin to have in one cup it's very thick at this point and it's not usually

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:26.129
Designed to cast quite this thick we're gonna see what happens anyway

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:33.299
Now that should just take a few minutes and then it'll start to solidify it'll get gelatinous and then turn hard

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:37.650
feeling on the sides it will also usually warm up as it catalyzes

00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:42.089
They'll be able to tell when the process is starting is the whole cup and start to get toast

00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:48.870
Looking down into it there are a lot of tiny little bubbles so the vacuum chamber really might do quite a bit too

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:57.299
for a honey consistency in this of a boil consistency oh now it's more of a molasses consistency

00:01:58.540 --> 00:02:01.350
It's getting very hot oh wow and there you go now it's

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:05.160
thickened up so much but it's not really even dripping off the popsicle stick anyway

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:06.730
There you have it that is now?

00:02:06.730 --> 00:02:12.389
catalyzed it is no longer liquid it's still curing it's still very warm and it's still fairly soft like it's a

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:15.449
spongy sort of solid at this point it will eventually get

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:16.600
To the point where it's completely

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:21.089
solid just a hard plastic resin now we know what it looks like if we don't put it in a vacuum chamber

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:23.190
let's try it in the vacuum

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:31.230
I'm gonna have to move fairly quickly so we'll pour 1/2 of the resin into the other stir it up and then put it into

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:36.149
The vacuum chamber throw the lid on and get pulling a vacuum as quickly as possible here goes oh?

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:44.580
There we go we've got like a foam forming on the surface now

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:50.039
most of the bubbles have broken at this point

00:02:50.739 --> 00:02:52.739
so we're looking like we just have a

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:55.890
resin that's mostly degassed

00:02:56.290 --> 00:02:59.549
It is still bubbling a lot so it's not degassed yet

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:05.160
it's kind of a race will it solidify first or will the gas all get pulled out of it first

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:08.880
there are still some bubbles coming out but the bubbles on the surface

00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:12.329
don't really look like they're moving and popping very much

00:03:13.239 --> 00:03:17.069
so i think our resin has probably started to cure already i

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:19.390
think that's it i

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:21.540
think our resin is no longer liquid

00:03:29.069 --> 00:03:34.819
couple little bubbles on the surface looked like they popped but for the most part that foam just sort of stayed in place where it

00:03:34.819 --> 00:03:36.819
was

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:39.120
look at this

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:45.560
Is nice and warm i'd say it's definitely started to cure down here in our cup we have this gelatinous

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:48.290
bubble foam on top

00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:53.329
you, can see it's cured these bubbles don't pop but they are a little bit squishy i

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:03.379
hope that demonstrates pretty well why i didn't try to degassed

00:04:03.590 --> 00:04:07.849
This type of resin before i used it to cast a record by the time it's pulled all of the air out

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:12.439
the resin has already set and you can't pour it into the mold anymore there is a

00:04:12.599 --> 00:04:16.698
variation on this experiment that i want to try a while back i was playing around with what

00:04:16.829 --> 00:04:19.698
different chemicals you could mix it together because that's my hobby

00:04:20.039 --> 00:04:27.199
and i tried mixing some of this resin with a little bit of clear elmer's glue and the result i got was pretty surprising

00:04:39.850 --> 00:04:46.320
Now as a comparison remember this is what happens with the normal resin when there is no glue added to it

00:04:47.710 --> 00:04:49.710
let's watch

00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:12.510
hasn't cured completely yet but it is getting there it's not liquid it doesn't fall out of the cup

00:05:14.170 --> 00:05:21.719
Pretty close so let's try mixing up our same combination of resin with glue in it and see what happens if we have this reaction

00:05:21.880 --> 00:05:23.880
in a vacuum

00:05:34.610 --> 00:05:37.520
Oh, we have a fast expansion now

00:05:42.569 --> 00:05:47.959
Maybe, too fast to the lack of pressure is just making it all destabilizing bubble

00:05:52.650 --> 00:05:58.009
there goes up and out this is why we have the plate

00:06:12.930 --> 00:06:18.349
just, kind of a bubbling foam red all over

00:06:29.919 --> 00:06:34.179
the bubbling does seem to be slowing down i don't know if that means the reaction is slowing down

00:06:34.490 --> 00:06:40.090
Or if it means that the reaction is getting near the end and all of the bubbles are actually starting to harden in place

00:06:57.150 --> 00:07:02.660
There we go i think at this point our resin has probably cured most of the way so let's add pressure back in and see

00:07:02.660 --> 00:07:04.759
what happens to those bubbles that have already formed

00:07:09.840 --> 00:07:11.840
not, a lot of change

00:07:21.330 --> 00:07:26.690
there we go it's still somewhat soft but it's just all made up of bubbles is just like a

00:07:27.449 --> 00:07:32.598
gelatinous phone almost at this point i don't know if i'll be able to get out from under the bubbles in this one so on

00:07:46.970 --> 00:07:48.440
there we go

00:07:48.440 --> 00:07:51.910
barely any resin stayed in our cup almost all of it bubbled out

00:07:51.980 --> 00:07:56.770
It spilled out all over onto our plate to make me very glad that i thought to put a plate in there

00:07:56.900 --> 00:07:59.079
other than that yeah we just have this

00:08:00.080 --> 00:08:02.080
sort of plastic feed

00:08:03.380 --> 00:08:05.770
sort of squishy foam going on

00:08:07.160 --> 00:08:12.910
interesting stuff glad we didn't try making your record out of this i don't think you would have played no ball

00:08:16.700 --> 00:08:18.190
So if it's obviously sticking

00:08:18.190 --> 00:08:22.960
To the plate quite a bit and i can't get it off but i can peel off sort of the top layer that's

00:08:23.420 --> 00:08:25.990
one heck of a texture it's just made of

00:08:26.510 --> 00:08:29.679
Bubbles really collapsed bubbles most of them popped as soon as

00:08:29.680 --> 00:08:31.010
we added pressure back in

00:08:31.010 --> 00:08:32.479
There we have it a whole bunch of?

00:08:32.479 --> 00:08:37.959
Varieties of what happens with this resin if we put it in the vacuum chamber we have our standard unvaccinated

00:08:39.400 --> 00:08:44.919
We have the same resin put into a vacuum chamber and we got some good bubbling action on the top it's

00:08:45.050 --> 00:08:47.530
solidified with all sorts of gaps and polls in it

00:08:47.630 --> 00:08:53.859
Showing why we didn't try to vacuum it before we cast our record with it we then have the resin mixed with a little bit

00:08:53.860 --> 00:08:59.380
Of clear elmer's glue which makes it foam up and bubbling bizarrely so we get this very lightweight

00:08:59.690 --> 00:09:05.979
low-density resin and then when we take that same combination we put that in the vacuum chamber it actually bubbles so

00:09:06.200 --> 00:09:10.689
aggressively that it just comes right up out of the cup spills all over and doesn't hold itself together

00:09:10.880 --> 00:09:17.439
nearly as well i hope you have enjoyed these tests of our resin in a vacuum chamber and mixed with some glue if you have

00:09:17.440 --> 00:09:22.030
some other ideas of things you want to see us try let us know down in the comments thanks for joining us for this video
