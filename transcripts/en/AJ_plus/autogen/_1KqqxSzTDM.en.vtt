00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:02.040
(inspiring music)

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:05.240
- [Mohamed] In my religion, if
I see somebody needs my help,

00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:07.840
and I'm able, I must help.

00:00:07.840 --> 00:00:10.000
[NPR Host] "Mohamed Bzeek knows that the children"

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.160
"he takes into his home are dying."

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:20.400
- I came to the United States in 1978.

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:24.360
I graduate from Utah State
as electronics engineer.

00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:26.920
I met my wife in 1989,

00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:29.600
and we started fostering
kids in the system.

00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:32.160
Since 1989, about 80 kids.

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:36.200
I used to go to the children's hospital

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:38.320
and see those kids who is terminal.

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:40.520
The minute they're born,
they have medical problems.

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:42.520
They have suffering, nobody wants them.

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:47.120
I believe that every kid has rights

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:49.800
to have a place to call
home and have family.

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:59.640
I try to make them better life.

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:03.600
The daughter I have,
she is deaf and blind.

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:05.560
She has almost no brain.

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:08.840
They're expecting her, I
mean, she lives few weeks,

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:13.240
but now she is on seven years and a half.

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:16.400
I know she has a soul, she has a feeling,

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:18.760
so I always talk to her, no matter what.

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:22.080
She knows that I am with
her and that I love her.

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:27.520
When President Trump signed,

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:29.400
banning the several Muslim countries,

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:31.720
one of them is my country, Libya.

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:35.800
The LA Times, they did the article

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:38.000
on my story in their newspaper.

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:42.840
From the first day, my story went viral,

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:45.480
not the United States, all over the world.

00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:47.320
- [News Anchor] "Mohamed
Bzeek has become something"

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:50.120
"of a local hero here in
Los Angeles recently."

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:52.240
(girl moaning)

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:56.200
- After three days, there
is somebody opened GoFundMe.

00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:59.680
It's a trust fund for those kids.

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:02.040
I remodeled my house,
we're fixing the roof,

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:06.280
and bought generator, central
heat and air condition.

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:10.720
What's the most important for
me, it was their comments.

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:13.680
I used to spend, like, three,
four hours every night,

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:15.080
reading on them and cry.

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:17.640
So many people said, "We
love what you doing,"

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:20.160
"You inspire us, you changed our life."

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:23.000
A lot of people say that,
"I wanna adopt children."

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.760
A secondary teacher in north California,

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:29.640
she did this book: "Mohamed
Bzeek, Beard Full of Love."

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:30.920
- [Woman] "This book is dedicated"

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:33.480
"to Mr. Bzeek and his children."

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:37.440
Some of them wrote notes, some of them wrote something.

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:43.640
This one, she said, "You
are my hero, Mr. Bzeek."

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:44.480
"I love you."

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:50.240
"Dear Mr. Bzeek, I hope
you take care of your"

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:51.280
"sick children."

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:53.520
It's really makes me feel happy, you know?

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:57.880
There's always good in this
world more than bad things.

00:02:57.880 --> 00:03:00.480
We are brothers and sisters in humanity.

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:05.360
Nobody wants to be alone.
We need each other.
