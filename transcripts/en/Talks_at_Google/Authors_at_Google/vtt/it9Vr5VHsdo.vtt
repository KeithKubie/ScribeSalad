BECKY: Please join me in
welcoming to Google New York

00:00:02.800 --> 00:00:04.258
Louisa Shafia.

00:00:04.258 --> 00:00:05.424
LOUISA SHAFIA: Thanks Becky.

00:00:08.119 --> 00:00:10.400
JACI BADZIN: So your book
opens with a really great

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:13.390
introduction to your
history and your heritage.

00:00:13.390 --> 00:00:16.720
Can you start by telling us a
bit about your personal story

00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:19.570
and your connection
with Persian food?

00:00:19.570 --> 00:00:22.830
LOUISA SHAFIA: Sure,
well, my dad is from Iran.

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:27.150
He grew up in a town called
Qazvin, which I'm not

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:29.300
saying in a nearly
guttural enough way.

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:31.880
It's really Qazvin.

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:34.020
And then he moved to
Tehran as a teenager,

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:36.680
and then he came to
the US to Philadelphia,

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:40.720
to be exact, to finish
his medical degree.

00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:44.740
So he came from a
large Muslim family,

00:00:44.740 --> 00:00:50.941
and in Philly he met my mom, who
is an American Ashkenazi Jew.

00:00:50.941 --> 00:00:52.190
JACI BADZIN: Very interesting.

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:54.920
LOUISA SHAFIA: And they fell
in love and got married.

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:59.940
And so I grew up with a
very diverse household

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:06.160
in Philadelphia, and
as most Iranian men,

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:08.340
my dad wasn't doing
a ton of cooking,

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:12.040
but my mom wanted to make
the dishes of his homeland

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:14.520
that he loved so she
really taught herself

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:16.480
how to make Persian dishes.

00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:20.470
And so maybe once every
few weeks on a Sunday

00:01:20.470 --> 00:01:24.140
my mom would start
the long, slow process

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:26.214
of making a big
Persian feast for us.

00:01:26.214 --> 00:01:27.130
And my dad would help.

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:27.820
I've got to give him credit.

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:28.500
He would help.

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:34.520
These flavors we're kind
of my every day flavors.

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:37.110
They were just part of my world.

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:39.880
It wasn't until I was
an adult and really

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:42.490
exploring all different
kinds of culinary traditions

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:45.810
that I kind of realized
this awesome food heritage

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:48.480
that I have.

00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:50.860
JACI BADZIN: Did you grew
up cooking with your mom

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:53.990
or was it something you
explored later on in life?

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:56.930
How did you find that
interest in cooking?

00:01:56.930 --> 00:02:00.500
LOUISA SHAFIA: Yes, I
was recruited by my mom

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:06.540
around age five-- no joke, to
help prepare for dinner parties

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:08.180
and gatherings that
she would have.

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:13.000
My mom loves to entertain, and
she's an amazing cook herself.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:17.250
I'm sure that's where I got
the bug to love to cook.

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:20.480
And she would have
us, my sister and I,

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:24.720
prepare crudites platters
and very simple desserts

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:26.280
and omelets.

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:29.710
And so I just grew up
feeling very comfortable

00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:32.350
experimenting with
food, so that's

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:34.042
for sure where it comes from.

00:02:34.042 --> 00:02:35.500
JACI BADZIN: That's
so interesting.

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:38.620
And this is your second
cookbook that's out,

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:41.690
and you've also written
numerous articles

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:45.639
for publications, "Food 52,"
the "Wall Street Journal."

00:02:45.639 --> 00:02:47.680
How did you get interested
in writing about food?

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:50.110
Was that something that
was also from a young age

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:52.910
or was it something that you
found when you were older?

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:54.600
LOUISA SHAFIA: I
really got into writing

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:57.850
after I had my catering
company for a couple of years.

00:02:57.850 --> 00:03:01.130
I had a catering company
called Lucid Food that

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:04.070
was all about sustainable
catering, really bringing

00:03:04.070 --> 00:03:07.680
the world of eco-friendly
thinking and locavore approach

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:10.770
to eating to the
world of fine-dining,

00:03:10.770 --> 00:03:14.280
doing something more interesting
than pigs in blankets

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:16.440
at nice corporate events.

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:19.060
And people got really
excited that you

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:22.485
could have these beautiful,
elegant hors d'oeuvres that

00:03:22.485 --> 00:03:24.320
were all sourced from
the farmer's market,

00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:27.610
and everything was being
composted along the way.

00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:31.900
And no one was really doing
it in New York at that time,

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:36.040
and people were so curious
and excited by this

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:39.120
because they hadn't really come
across it before that that's

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:42.160
when I got inspired to write
my first cookbook, which

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:45.710
is "Seasonal Cooking
and Eco-friendly

00:03:45.710 --> 00:03:48.230
Tips for the Kitchen."
and I just kind of wanted

00:03:48.230 --> 00:03:51.420
to take all that experience that
I got with my catering company,

00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:53.890
and all those things I
shared and share them

00:03:53.890 --> 00:03:57.060
with a bigger
audience in a book.

00:03:57.060 --> 00:03:59.540
JACI BADZIN: So this book
is called, the new book,

00:03:59.540 --> 00:04:01.880
is called "The New
Persian Kitchen."

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:05.280
What is your definition of
the new Persian kitchen?

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:09.080
LOUISA SHAFIA: Well, the
new Persian kitchen-- well,

00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:13.450
I should say in
context, Persian cooking

00:04:13.450 --> 00:04:16.290
has a very different
timeline than say,

00:04:16.290 --> 00:04:19.860
American cooking or
even European cooking.

00:04:19.860 --> 00:04:25.000
Persian cooking goes back
literally thousands of years.

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:29.550
So at the ruins of Persepolis,
which was the ancient ritual

00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:31.940
capital of the
Persian Empire, what

00:04:31.940 --> 00:04:37.980
is now modern day Iran, the
makings of fesenjoon stew,

00:04:37.980 --> 00:04:41.680
which is one of the most iconic
stews eaten today in Iran.

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:44.960
It's made from ground walnuts
and pomegranate molasses.

00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:50.200
All the makings of that were
found written on stone tablets

00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:52.270
at Persepolis.

00:04:52.270 --> 00:04:54.580
So even back then, they
were using pomegranates.

00:04:54.580 --> 00:04:55.710
They were using walnuts.

00:04:55.710 --> 00:04:57.290
They were using parsley.

00:04:57.290 --> 00:05:00.330
They were using garlic.

00:05:00.330 --> 00:05:04.250
So when you say the
new Persian kitchen,

00:05:04.250 --> 00:05:07.560
it's taking something
that's very ancient

00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:10.340
and kind of riffing on it.

00:05:10.340 --> 00:05:14.140
So I'm sort of doing a
take on Persian food that's

00:05:14.140 --> 00:05:16.950
very much inspired by
this ancient cuisine,

00:05:16.950 --> 00:05:23.130
by the very sensuous
ingredients, like saffron

00:05:23.130 --> 00:05:27.050
and rose water and
sumac, and filtering it

00:05:27.050 --> 00:05:30.750
through my own very
healthy way of eating.

00:05:30.750 --> 00:05:34.850
So putting in whole grains,
instead of white rice.

00:05:34.850 --> 00:05:38.470
Cutting back on sugar, really
trying to put the emphasis back

00:05:38.470 --> 00:05:41.810
on fresh fruits and
vegetables, which really

00:05:41.810 --> 00:05:45.690
are the foundation
of Persian food.

00:05:45.690 --> 00:05:52.450
JACI BADZIN: So the inspiration
for this cookbook would be,

00:05:52.450 --> 00:05:55.160
was it founded more
in your heritage?

00:05:55.160 --> 00:06:00.680
Was it wanting to express
your new techniques

00:06:00.680 --> 00:06:02.520
and connect them
back with your roots?

00:06:02.520 --> 00:06:05.990
Where did this inspiration
come from to write this book?

00:06:05.990 --> 00:06:10.500
LOUISA SHAFIA: Well, I entered
the professional culinary world

00:06:10.500 --> 00:06:14.540
with a very strong focus
on healthy cooking.

00:06:14.540 --> 00:06:18.630
In fact, I was vegan when I
started my career as a chef.

00:06:18.630 --> 00:06:20.010
JACI BADZIN: That's interesting.

00:06:20.010 --> 00:06:23.030
LOUISA SHAFIA: Yes, and I
went to a very healthy cooking

00:06:23.030 --> 00:06:23.530
school.

00:06:23.530 --> 00:06:25.280
It's called the Natural
Gourmet Institute.

00:06:25.280 --> 00:06:28.470
It's here in New York, and
I was vegan at the time.

00:06:28.470 --> 00:06:31.227
I entered-- all of my
teachers at the school

00:06:31.227 --> 00:06:33.560
were middle-aged women, and
they all told me being vegan

00:06:33.560 --> 00:06:35.450
was the worst thing I
could do for my health.

00:06:35.450 --> 00:06:38.190
So I left cooking
school no longer vegan,

00:06:38.190 --> 00:06:42.020
and after I finished, I
moved to San Francisco

00:06:42.020 --> 00:06:45.700
to cook at this awesome vegan
restaurant called Millennium.

00:06:45.700 --> 00:06:47.420
And I have to say
one of my first meals

00:06:47.420 --> 00:06:49.780
in San Francisco
was at Luna Park,

00:06:49.780 --> 00:06:53.560
and I had fish for the
first time in a few years.

00:06:53.560 --> 00:06:56.620
I'm bringing that up because
you said you used to work there.

00:06:56.620 --> 00:06:58.661
JACI BADZIN: That's how
I got my start at Google,

00:06:58.661 --> 00:07:01.740
as a hostess at Luna Park, in
case you guys are wondering.

00:07:01.740 --> 00:07:02.235
LOUISA SHAFIA: Great restaurant.

00:07:02.235 --> 00:07:03.610
JACI BADZIN: It's
a great restaurant.

00:07:03.610 --> 00:07:04.420
Still open, too.

00:07:04.420 --> 00:07:05.836
LOUISA SHAFIA:
Still going strong.

00:07:08.260 --> 00:07:11.130
Yeah, I started cooking
at Millennium, loved it.

00:07:11.130 --> 00:07:13.890
Was so inspired by all
the different ingredients

00:07:13.890 --> 00:07:15.160
we were using.

00:07:15.160 --> 00:07:18.680
In San Francisco at the
time, that was 2001.

00:07:18.680 --> 00:07:21.420
Everyone was already deeply
into the locavore thing,

00:07:21.420 --> 00:07:23.920
and we had farmers coming to
the back door of the restaurant

00:07:23.920 --> 00:07:27.040
dropping off foraged
mushrooms and chilies

00:07:27.040 --> 00:07:28.730
and all kinds of cool things.

00:07:28.730 --> 00:07:32.340
So one day, my chef asked
me if I would come up

00:07:32.340 --> 00:07:34.470
with a new dish for the menu.

00:07:34.470 --> 00:07:38.590
And we were already using a
huge diversity of ingredients,

00:07:38.590 --> 00:07:42.870
Korean things, Japanese,
African, and my first thought

00:07:42.870 --> 00:07:46.180
was what can I do that
no one's done here yet?

00:07:46.180 --> 00:07:48.610
And I knew nobody had
done Persian food.

00:07:48.610 --> 00:07:50.500
I just knew it,
because there's not

00:07:50.500 --> 00:07:54.110
a lot of Persians or Persian
restaurants in the Bay Area.

00:07:54.110 --> 00:07:59.610
And so I thought, I
think I'll try fesenjoon,

00:07:59.610 --> 00:08:04.180
which is pomegranate and
walnut stew usually made

00:08:04.180 --> 00:08:08.160
with either turkey or
chicken or sometimes, duck.

00:08:08.160 --> 00:08:11.860
And I did a vegan version of it.

00:08:11.860 --> 00:08:13.460
The ingredients are magical.

00:08:13.460 --> 00:08:17.530
That combination of the bitter
walnuts and the tart and sweet

00:08:17.530 --> 00:08:19.414
pomegranate, that's
all you need.

00:08:19.414 --> 00:08:21.830
And it almost doesn't matter
if there's meat in it or not,

00:08:21.830 --> 00:08:23.130
it's just so good.

00:08:23.130 --> 00:08:25.980
So I didn't know how to cook
with any Persian ingredients

00:08:25.980 --> 00:08:26.660
at that time.

00:08:26.660 --> 00:08:29.990
It was a huge process
of discovery for me.

00:08:29.990 --> 00:08:32.690
And I found some
different versions

00:08:32.690 --> 00:08:35.830
of recipes for fesenjoon, and
I muddled my way through it,

00:08:35.830 --> 00:08:38.140
and came up with something.

00:08:38.140 --> 00:08:41.320
Everyone tasted it, and
said, whoa, what is this?

00:08:41.320 --> 00:08:42.280
This is so great.

00:08:42.280 --> 00:08:46.330
It's sweet, and it's tart, and
its rich, and it's beautiful.

00:08:46.330 --> 00:08:50.190
I added some grated
red beets to the dish

00:08:50.190 --> 00:08:52.100
to make it a beautiful
deep red color.

00:08:52.100 --> 00:08:54.970
And it went on the menu,
and everyone liked it.

00:08:54.970 --> 00:08:57.750
And that was really the
start of me discovering

00:08:57.750 --> 00:09:00.580
this amazing food heritage
that I had grown up

00:09:00.580 --> 00:09:02.680
with but I'd never
been aware of.

00:09:02.680 --> 00:09:04.470
JACI BADZIN: So cool.

00:09:04.470 --> 00:09:09.160
Do you find that there's an
opening within vegan style

00:09:09.160 --> 00:09:10.960
food for more Persian cooking?

00:09:10.960 --> 00:09:12.940
It feels like it'd
be a pretty good fit.

00:09:12.940 --> 00:09:15.680
I mean, yes, there's the
yogurt, and there's the meat,

00:09:15.680 --> 00:09:18.170
but do you think that
there is an opportunity

00:09:18.170 --> 00:09:24.010
to expand that vegan
lifestyle with more

00:09:24.010 --> 00:09:25.960
immersion of Persian
food in the ingredients?

00:09:25.960 --> 00:09:27.250
Do you think there's--

00:09:27.250 --> 00:09:28.750
LOUISA SHAFIA: Absolutely.

00:09:28.750 --> 00:09:31.000
Persian food is all
about the flavors.

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:34.780
And traditionally, meat
was used to just boost

00:09:34.780 --> 00:09:35.870
the flavor of things.

00:09:35.870 --> 00:09:38.370
It never had a starring role.

00:09:38.370 --> 00:09:40.690
It's only kind of now
that meat is so much

00:09:40.690 --> 00:09:45.680
more accessible and cheap that
you'll see these huge kabob

00:09:45.680 --> 00:09:49.420
fests and super meaty stews.

00:09:49.420 --> 00:09:51.730
But traditionally, meat
was just a small element,

00:09:51.730 --> 00:09:54.510
and you can do these dishes
completely without meat.

00:09:54.510 --> 00:09:57.480
If you're doing-- there's
all these classic stews,

00:09:57.480 --> 00:09:59.930
like fesenjoon,
there's bademjoon,

00:09:59.930 --> 00:10:02.140
which is eggplant
and tomato stew.

00:10:02.140 --> 00:10:04.680
There's ghormeh
sabzi, which is herbs.

00:10:04.680 --> 00:10:05.800
It's all green herbs.

00:10:05.800 --> 00:10:09.050
When it's finished it's this
beautiful vibrant green color.

00:10:09.050 --> 00:10:11.580
And it's really
flavored with something

00:10:11.580 --> 00:10:15.410
called dried limes, which
is a very particular Persian

00:10:15.410 --> 00:10:15.990
ingredient.

00:10:15.990 --> 00:10:18.320
And it's kind of
like lime times 12,

00:10:18.320 --> 00:10:20.450
because you cook
with the whole lime.

00:10:20.450 --> 00:10:21.065
JACI BADZIN: I read
that in your book,

00:10:21.065 --> 00:10:22.810
and was like, what
is this dried lime?

00:10:22.810 --> 00:10:23.890
I want to try it.

00:10:23.890 --> 00:10:25.800
LOUISA SHAFIA: Oh,
they're so good.

00:10:25.800 --> 00:10:29.450
They're super sweet and kind
of bitter at the same time.

00:10:29.450 --> 00:10:33.850
But it's all about those
flavors so you really

00:10:33.850 --> 00:10:35.300
don't need the meat.

00:10:35.300 --> 00:10:39.030
And in my cookbook, I try
and give vegetarian or even

00:10:39.030 --> 00:10:42.120
a vegan version of all
of the meat dishes,

00:10:42.120 --> 00:10:44.400
because the whole
point is to make

00:10:44.400 --> 00:10:46.480
use of the fruits
and vegetables.

00:10:46.480 --> 00:10:50.090
And here, I want to point
out that Iran always

00:10:50.090 --> 00:10:53.510
had an abundance of fresh
fruits and vegetables

00:10:53.510 --> 00:10:56.270
and herbs, very
much unlike a lot

00:10:56.270 --> 00:10:58.020
of other parts of
the Middle East.

00:10:58.020 --> 00:11:00.045
But Iran has a
temperate climate.

00:11:00.045 --> 00:11:01.740
It has four seasons.

00:11:01.740 --> 00:11:04.180
It's surrounded by two
mountain ranges that

00:11:04.180 --> 00:11:07.980
are covered with snow
throughout the whole year, which

00:11:07.980 --> 00:11:11.060
most people, I'm sure, think
of Iran as a big desert.

00:11:11.060 --> 00:11:11.780
But it's not.

00:11:11.780 --> 00:11:15.970
There's marshy areas and
meadows and mountain ranges

00:11:15.970 --> 00:11:19.160
and very, very
diverse geography.

00:11:19.160 --> 00:11:21.020
But the ancient
Iranians figured out

00:11:21.020 --> 00:11:24.030
a way to bring the melted
snow water from the mountains

00:11:24.030 --> 00:11:29.510
into vast desert areas and
have these lush gardens growing

00:11:29.510 --> 00:11:30.350
in the desert.

00:11:30.350 --> 00:11:32.320
JACI BADZIN: And the
irrigation systems

00:11:32.320 --> 00:11:35.510
are something that's
known historically,

00:11:35.510 --> 00:11:38.585
that they've been
able to develop

00:11:38.585 --> 00:11:40.210
these amazing lush
gardens and it's

00:11:40.210 --> 00:11:42.100
depicted in books and
stories and movies,

00:11:42.100 --> 00:11:44.470
and it's really fascinating.

00:11:44.470 --> 00:11:47.460
And I feel like that comes
across in your book really

00:11:47.460 --> 00:11:50.050
well through your writings,
but also through the imagery

00:11:50.050 --> 00:11:53.230
and through your emphasis
on herbs and on produce.

00:11:53.230 --> 00:11:56.650
And even taking the
different-- like the limes,

00:11:56.650 --> 00:11:57.760
which were fantastic.

00:11:57.760 --> 00:11:59.830
There's a bit about
the caramelized onions

00:11:59.830 --> 00:12:02.660
too that it just--
it's so interesting how

00:12:02.660 --> 00:12:05.240
you take fresh ingredients,
and you can just

00:12:05.240 --> 00:12:07.535
build and build and build
these really amazing dishes.

00:12:07.535 --> 00:12:08.550
LOUISA SHAFIA:
Yes, and thank you

00:12:08.550 --> 00:12:10.390
for bringing up the
caramelized onions.

00:12:10.390 --> 00:12:11.980
Caramelized onions
is something you

00:12:11.980 --> 00:12:15.100
see in many, many
Persian dishes.

00:12:15.100 --> 00:12:18.210
It's often used as a
topping for things,

00:12:18.210 --> 00:12:22.270
and that is a great way to
bring a foundation of really

00:12:22.270 --> 00:12:26.130
deep, rich flavor into a dish,
even if it doesn't have meat.

00:12:26.130 --> 00:12:29.200
So if you're trying to make
these dishes vegetarian,

00:12:29.200 --> 00:12:31.800
take the time to make
some really nice,

00:12:31.800 --> 00:12:34.580
slowly cooked
caramelized onions.

00:12:34.580 --> 00:12:37.890
They will fill in for
the flavor of meat

00:12:37.890 --> 00:12:41.180
and really round out a dish
in a very powerful way.

00:12:41.180 --> 00:12:42.260
It takes a little time.

00:12:42.260 --> 00:12:45.970
They can take about an hour
to really do it the right way.

00:12:45.970 --> 00:12:49.486
You start on high heat with
your thinly sliced onions,

00:12:49.486 --> 00:12:51.485
then reduce the heat and
just let them cook down

00:12:51.485 --> 00:12:53.650
and cook down until they're
really dark and just

00:12:53.650 --> 00:12:55.590
a fraction of their size.

00:12:55.590 --> 00:12:59.690
And they're sweet
and rich and smokey.

00:12:59.690 --> 00:13:00.630
Everything you want.

00:13:00.630 --> 00:13:02.024
JACI BADZIN: So good.

00:13:02.024 --> 00:13:04.500
Do we have caramelized
onions today in the cafe?

00:13:04.500 --> 00:13:05.370
I hope we do

00:13:05.370 --> 00:13:08.160
LOUISA SHAFIA: I hope we
do after that description.

00:13:08.160 --> 00:13:12.440
So talking, again, there's these
amazing traditional ingredients

00:13:12.440 --> 00:13:17.060
and your culinary interest
and personal interest in vegan

00:13:17.060 --> 00:13:20.300
food, the recipes
in this book are

00:13:20.300 --> 00:13:23.750
really-- they are a mix of
traditional and innovative.

00:13:23.750 --> 00:13:26.800
And can you tell us a bit about
how you created the recipes

00:13:26.800 --> 00:13:29.627
in this book, and how this
collection came together?

00:13:29.627 --> 00:13:30.460
LOUISA SHAFIA: Sure.

00:13:30.460 --> 00:13:35.180
Well, it was kind of a
process of discovery.

00:13:35.180 --> 00:13:39.850
I had originally wanted to go
research this cookbook in Iran,

00:13:39.850 --> 00:13:42.410
but I wasn't able to get
the documentation to go,

00:13:42.410 --> 00:13:44.416
and I was very sad about that.

00:13:44.416 --> 00:13:46.290
And then a friend of
mine said, why don't you

00:13:46.290 --> 00:13:49.180
just go to Los Angeles?

00:13:49.180 --> 00:13:53.510
And if you don't
know, Los Angeles

00:13:53.510 --> 00:13:57.220
has the biggest Iranian
population outside of Iran.

00:13:57.220 --> 00:14:01.440
And a lot of my extended
Iranian family is out there.

00:14:01.440 --> 00:14:05.100
I have at least 20
family members out there.

00:14:05.100 --> 00:14:07.540
And I thought,
that's a great idea,

00:14:07.540 --> 00:14:11.380
because I won't have to wear
a chador and cover my head,

00:14:11.380 --> 00:14:13.310
and I'll be able to get around.

00:14:13.310 --> 00:14:16.250
And I speak the
language, English.

00:14:16.250 --> 00:14:22.270
So I went out there and kind of
in my honor of being out there,

00:14:22.270 --> 00:14:25.940
we had all these
amazing family feasts.

00:14:25.940 --> 00:14:27.310
It was so cool.

00:14:27.310 --> 00:14:29.070
These all day feasts.

00:14:29.070 --> 00:14:31.290
You get there at 12:00
or 1:00 on a Sunday,

00:14:31.290 --> 00:14:33.510
and you leave at
maybe 9:00 or 10:00.

00:14:33.510 --> 00:14:35.890
You've had about
three rounds of food,

00:14:35.890 --> 00:14:39.260
and you're just feeling super
happy and tons of black tea

00:14:39.260 --> 00:14:40.880
in between every meal.

00:14:40.880 --> 00:14:45.370
And from that, I got to see the
favorite dishes that everybody

00:14:45.370 --> 00:14:51.670
made, sholeh zard, the sweet
rice pudding with saffron rice,

00:14:51.670 --> 00:14:54.919
with dates, adas polo, all
these different dishes.

00:14:54.919 --> 00:14:56.960
So I got to see the ones
my family members really

00:14:56.960 --> 00:14:58.810
loved and I got to taste those.

00:14:58.810 --> 00:15:00.640
And I thought, OK, I
really like this one.

00:15:00.640 --> 00:15:01.306
I like that one.

00:15:01.306 --> 00:15:03.440
I'm going to try my
own recipe for this.

00:15:03.440 --> 00:15:05.510
And then my relatives
took the time

00:15:05.510 --> 00:15:06.820
to get in the kitchen with me.

00:15:06.820 --> 00:15:09.060
So I would come over for
these intense all day

00:15:09.060 --> 00:15:12.150
cooking sessions
with my cousins,

00:15:12.150 --> 00:15:14.399
and they showed me
really step-by-step

00:15:14.399 --> 00:15:16.190
how they made some of
their favorite dishes

00:15:16.190 --> 00:15:20.050
like rice with fava beans
and dill, which is just

00:15:20.050 --> 00:15:23.350
a beautiful dish for any
time that stuff is in season.

00:15:23.350 --> 00:15:26.124
And so I really
learned that way.

00:15:26.124 --> 00:15:27.790
And then being there,
I was able to shop

00:15:27.790 --> 00:15:29.730
at all these Persian
grocery stores because I

00:15:29.730 --> 00:15:32.030
had all the ingredients
on hand like I had never

00:15:32.030 --> 00:15:33.350
had in New York.

00:15:33.350 --> 00:15:38.210
So I could get rose petals,
I could get date syrup,

00:15:38.210 --> 00:15:41.710
dried limes, barberries,
anything I needed

00:15:41.710 --> 00:15:44.830
and just play around and
experiment in my kitchen.

00:15:44.830 --> 00:15:48.780
And so through that
process I kind of chose

00:15:48.780 --> 00:15:53.270
some of those classic dishes
from the Persian cannon.

00:15:53.270 --> 00:15:56.430
They kind of have a cannon
of classic rice dishes,

00:15:56.430 --> 00:15:59.020
classic stews, classic desserts.

00:15:59.020 --> 00:16:00.740
So I took some of
those and then I just

00:16:00.740 --> 00:16:04.430
created some that were
inspired by-- like there's

00:16:04.430 --> 00:16:06.130
a chicken dish in the book.

00:16:06.130 --> 00:16:09.260
It's turmeric chicken
with sumac and line.

00:16:09.260 --> 00:16:10.690
And I really wanted to have--

00:16:10.690 --> 00:16:11.490
JACI BADZIN: It's
featured today.

00:16:11.490 --> 00:16:13.100
LOUISA SHAFIA: Yes,
is on today's menu.

00:16:13.100 --> 00:16:14.020
JACI BADZIN: It looks so good.

00:16:14.020 --> 00:16:16.540
LOUISA SHAFIA: I can't wait
to taste their version of it.

00:16:16.540 --> 00:16:19.350
But I wanted to make a
dish that encapsulated

00:16:19.350 --> 00:16:20.920
all the flavors
of Persian cooking

00:16:20.920 --> 00:16:23.190
but didn't take several
hours and only used

00:16:23.190 --> 00:16:24.770
a handful of ingredients.

00:16:24.770 --> 00:16:28.810
So you just season the
chicken thighs or breasts

00:16:28.810 --> 00:16:32.590
with a little bit of turmeric
and salt, sear them in a pan,

00:16:32.590 --> 00:16:34.700
then add some water
and garlic and let

00:16:34.700 --> 00:16:36.720
it braise for 25 minutes.

00:16:36.720 --> 00:16:39.240
Take it out, season
with some lime juice

00:16:39.240 --> 00:16:43.350
and some sumac powder, so you've
got a lot of tartness in there.

00:16:43.350 --> 00:16:47.000
You've got saltiness, you've
got richness from the chicken.

00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:49.880
And it's really
well-rounded and full so it

00:16:49.880 --> 00:16:52.460
tastes like you were
cooking all day,

00:16:52.460 --> 00:16:55.470
but it's kind of
for an Americans

00:16:55.470 --> 00:16:58.940
modern tolerance of
how much time you

00:16:58.940 --> 00:17:00.724
want to spend in the kitchen.

00:17:00.724 --> 00:17:03.140
JACI BADZIN: It's really-- one
of the other things I loved

00:17:03.140 --> 00:17:08.819
about this book is that it's
a book that's-- it so useful.

00:17:08.819 --> 00:17:11.440
It so just connects immediately.

00:17:11.440 --> 00:17:13.190
There's so many recipes
in there that you

00:17:13.190 --> 00:17:15.550
could make in a tiny
kitchen in Manhattan.

00:17:15.550 --> 00:17:18.240
You can also make in
a huge kitchen in LA,

00:17:18.240 --> 00:17:23.022
and it's so approachable that
I just kept flipping through

00:17:23.022 --> 00:17:24.730
and I was like, I want
to make this dish.

00:17:24.730 --> 00:17:25.990
No, I want to make this dish.

00:17:25.990 --> 00:17:28.850
It's really vibrant
and really amazing.

00:17:28.850 --> 00:17:30.990
And the ingredients
that you talk about too

00:17:30.990 --> 00:17:36.927
are so vast, fantastic,
but possibly not the most--

00:17:36.927 --> 00:17:39.260
some of the ingredients, what
I thought was interesting,

00:17:39.260 --> 00:17:43.560
is that they may not be
found in the form in the book

00:17:43.560 --> 00:17:45.420
of the recipes, but
you give instructions

00:17:45.420 --> 00:17:47.150
on how to make them
or even sometimes

00:17:47.150 --> 00:17:50.720
substitutions, which I
thought was a really helpful.

00:17:50.720 --> 00:17:54.090
If you had to suggest a
few key ingredients to have

00:17:54.090 --> 00:17:57.150
in your house to cook from your
book or to cook Persian food,

00:17:57.150 --> 00:17:58.390
what would they be?

00:17:58.390 --> 00:18:00.420
LOUISA SHAFIA: Oh, I
love that question.

00:18:00.420 --> 00:18:03.540
Turmeric would be one.

00:18:03.540 --> 00:18:08.680
Sumac, which is a little
purple powder that

00:18:08.680 --> 00:18:13.150
comes from the sumac
berries, not poison sumac,

00:18:13.150 --> 00:18:14.569
just edible sumac.

00:18:14.569 --> 00:18:15.860
They look completely different.

00:18:15.860 --> 00:18:16.930
Two different plants.

00:18:16.930 --> 00:18:20.360
And it sort of serves the
purpose of lemon juice,

00:18:20.360 --> 00:18:22.400
but you don't need to
have a fresh lemon around.

00:18:22.400 --> 00:18:25.690
It's tart and kind of salty
and actually very high

00:18:25.690 --> 00:18:28.470
in vitamin C.

00:18:28.470 --> 00:18:31.610
Pomegranate molasses, which is
just pomegranate juice cooked

00:18:31.610 --> 00:18:34.950
down, again, tart and sweet.

00:18:34.950 --> 00:18:38.885
Dried limes, which
maybe they're not

00:18:38.885 --> 00:18:41.380
that easy to find in a store,
but there's a lot of places

00:18:41.380 --> 00:18:46.100
you can order them online,
and they keep forever.

00:18:46.100 --> 00:18:52.190
And I guess, dried mint, which
you can throw into any dish

00:18:52.190 --> 00:18:57.380
and transform the flavor and
make it exotic and eastern

00:18:57.380 --> 00:18:59.219
just by adding that at the end.

00:18:59.219 --> 00:19:00.760
JACI BADZIN:
Interesting, dried mint.

00:19:00.760 --> 00:19:01.730
I'm going to add that.

00:19:01.730 --> 00:19:04.260
LOUISA SHAFIA: It's
spearmint, in particular.

00:19:04.260 --> 00:19:06.790
So it's not peppermint, and
it's not just general mint,

00:19:06.790 --> 00:19:10.490
it's really spearmint that
has that real fullness

00:19:10.490 --> 00:19:11.730
and that real savory taste.

00:19:11.730 --> 00:19:12.690
JACI BADZIN: And
the difference too.

00:19:12.690 --> 00:19:14.210
I'm glad you clarified that.

00:19:14.210 --> 00:19:18.930
Spearmint versus peppermint,
that's really interesting.

00:19:18.930 --> 00:19:21.530
In your book, it states
that according to Persian

00:19:21.530 --> 00:19:25.490
tradition foods can either heat
your body up or cool it down,

00:19:25.490 --> 00:19:26.980
and it's typically
advised that you

00:19:26.980 --> 00:19:29.080
keep these energies
carefully balanced.

00:19:29.080 --> 00:19:32.920
So with that in mind, can
you recommend a balanced meal

00:19:32.920 --> 00:19:34.867
according to Persian tradition?

00:19:34.867 --> 00:19:35.700
LOUISA SHAFIA: Sure.

00:19:35.700 --> 00:19:39.650
So a classic balanced
meal is actually

00:19:39.650 --> 00:19:43.920
a kabob platter, which
is your kabobs, which

00:19:43.920 --> 00:19:45.810
are hot by nature.

00:19:45.810 --> 00:19:47.680
Meat is hot.

00:19:47.680 --> 00:19:52.870
You have your rice, which can be
studded with anything from nuts

00:19:52.870 --> 00:19:57.160
to dried fruit to
meat to fresh herbs.

00:19:57.160 --> 00:20:01.541
You have grilled
tomatoes on there,

00:20:01.541 --> 00:20:03.040
and then you're
always going to have

00:20:03.040 --> 00:20:06.580
sumac sprinkled over the
rice, and that is cooling.

00:20:06.580 --> 00:20:09.410
And you're always going
to have a glass of doogh,

00:20:09.410 --> 00:20:14.340
which is a salty
mint yogurt soda.

00:20:14.340 --> 00:20:18.650
It sounds weird, so delicious.

00:20:18.650 --> 00:20:21.625
It's just yogurt with--
I like to make it

00:20:21.625 --> 00:20:22.500
with sparkling water.

00:20:22.500 --> 00:20:24.040
You could make it with flat.

00:20:24.040 --> 00:20:26.560
Put a little bit of dried
mint in there, some salt,

00:20:26.560 --> 00:20:30.940
a little bit of garlic,
and it is so good.

00:20:30.940 --> 00:20:34.010
And that is really,
really cooling,

00:20:34.010 --> 00:20:37.430
and that's why you
have it with that meal.

00:20:37.430 --> 00:20:40.590
Iranians have a very
specific philosophy

00:20:40.590 --> 00:20:42.960
about healthy eating
that, again, goes back

00:20:42.960 --> 00:20:47.180
thousands of years, just like
ayurvedic cooking and dietary

00:20:47.180 --> 00:20:47.690
rules.

00:20:47.690 --> 00:20:50.190
And just like traditional
Chinese medicine,

00:20:50.190 --> 00:20:52.380
Iranians have this
theory that goes back,

00:20:52.380 --> 00:20:54.380
and you always want
to stay balanced.

00:20:54.380 --> 00:20:57.120
If you get too much of
hot or too much of cold,

00:20:57.120 --> 00:20:58.370
you're going to get sick.

00:20:58.370 --> 00:20:59.980
JACI BADZIN: Very interesting.

00:20:59.980 --> 00:21:02.070
Your first cookbook,
as you mentioned,

00:21:02.070 --> 00:21:05.620
was focused on
eco-friendly food.

00:21:05.620 --> 00:21:08.080
This book focuses
on your heritage

00:21:08.080 --> 00:21:10.210
in more traditional
Persian elements.

00:21:10.210 --> 00:21:13.740
Will the reader see any
similarities between the two

00:21:13.740 --> 00:21:17.390
books or is it a
pretty different route

00:21:17.390 --> 00:21:19.620
from your first book?

00:21:19.620 --> 00:21:22.690
LOUISA SHAFIA: There's a lot of
common ground between the two.

00:21:22.690 --> 00:21:26.070
It's funny, with the first
book, I only had, I guess,

00:21:26.070 --> 00:21:28.600
a couple of chicken dishes
and some fish dishes in there.

00:21:28.600 --> 00:21:32.090
It was really true to
my vegetarian heritage.

00:21:32.090 --> 00:21:36.400
In this book, meat is
such of integral part

00:21:36.400 --> 00:21:37.690
of Persian cooking.

00:21:37.690 --> 00:21:40.690
It's really one of
the characteristics

00:21:40.690 --> 00:21:44.880
of all these classic
Persian stews and rice,

00:21:44.880 --> 00:21:46.710
even if it's just
a small amount.

00:21:46.710 --> 00:21:49.710
So I really wanted to be true
to that, so I debated a while.

00:21:49.710 --> 00:21:53.370
But I did end up including lamb,
which is the meat that you'll

00:21:53.370 --> 00:21:58.250
find most often in Iranian
cooking, lots of chicken,

00:21:58.250 --> 00:22:01.050
a fair amount of fish
and seafood dishes,

00:22:01.050 --> 00:22:04.490
which they have all different
kinds of fish in Iran.

00:22:04.490 --> 00:22:07.170
Down by the Persian
Gulf, there's one kind.

00:22:07.170 --> 00:22:10.500
Up near the Caspian Sea,
there's different kinds.

00:22:10.500 --> 00:22:13.360
So I did include those,
and then, I really

00:22:13.360 --> 00:22:17.190
have an emphasis on
cooking with whole grains,

00:22:17.190 --> 00:22:21.340
finding healthy alternatives
to maybe less healthy ways

00:22:21.340 --> 00:22:22.500
of cooking.

00:22:22.500 --> 00:22:24.690
If you go to a Persian
restaurant these days,

00:22:24.690 --> 00:22:27.670
you'll often find dishes that
are made with a lot of oil.

00:22:27.670 --> 00:22:29.750
So I have suggestions
for cutting down on oil

00:22:29.750 --> 00:22:31.750
and also using
healthier cooking oils,

00:22:31.750 --> 00:22:36.450
like coconut oil,
things like almond oil,

00:22:36.450 --> 00:22:39.460
using extra virgin olive oil
for garnishing at the end.

00:22:39.460 --> 00:22:42.370
So you can definitely
tell that both books

00:22:42.370 --> 00:22:45.170
were written by a health nut.

00:22:45.170 --> 00:22:46.430
That's the common ground.

00:22:46.430 --> 00:22:47.590
JACI BADZIN: That's great.

00:22:47.590 --> 00:22:50.020
What was your favorite
discovery of writing this book?

00:22:50.020 --> 00:22:53.480
Your second cookbook,
so you are familiar.

00:22:53.480 --> 00:22:55.500
You've written a
book before, but what

00:22:55.500 --> 00:22:59.770
was your favorite discovery
of this particular journey?

00:22:59.770 --> 00:23:02.280
LOUISA SHAFIA: Gosh, I
mean there were so many

00:23:02.280 --> 00:23:06.490
little particular food things
that I discovered, just

00:23:06.490 --> 00:23:10.040
like the whole
ingredient, dried mint.

00:23:10.040 --> 00:23:11.700
I loved discovering that.

00:23:11.700 --> 00:23:15.310
But I think the bigger thing
for me was the opportunity

00:23:15.310 --> 00:23:18.670
to really get to know
my Persian family

00:23:18.670 --> 00:23:21.500
and get this opportunity
to really be immersed

00:23:21.500 --> 00:23:23.860
in the culture like I
had never been growing up

00:23:23.860 --> 00:23:25.300
in Philadelphia.

00:23:25.300 --> 00:23:28.890
And I think just really
understanding that,

00:23:28.890 --> 00:23:33.950
and also understanding that I
was part of this sort of bigger

00:23:33.950 --> 00:23:37.170
tribe, if you will,
and going out to LA

00:23:37.170 --> 00:23:40.650
and looking around and seeing
that everybody looked like me.

00:23:40.650 --> 00:23:46.020
That was an amazing discovery
and a completely new feeling.

00:23:46.020 --> 00:23:47.420
JACI BADZIN: So cool.

00:23:47.420 --> 00:23:52.810
So besides your cookbooks,
what is a cookbook

00:23:52.810 --> 00:23:55.010
that you would recommend,
like a must-have cookbook

00:23:55.010 --> 00:23:57.160
that you would recommend
for people to have?

00:23:57.160 --> 00:23:57.951
LOUISA SHAFIA: Yes.

00:23:57.951 --> 00:23:59.660
Just yesterday I
was looking at it.

00:23:59.660 --> 00:24:02.650
It's called "The Legendary
Cuisine of Persia"

00:24:02.650 --> 00:24:07.660
by a woman named Margaret
Shaida, S-H-A-I-D-A.

00:24:07.660 --> 00:24:10.890
She was an English woman who
married an Iranian and lived

00:24:10.890 --> 00:24:12.790
in Iran for decades.

00:24:12.790 --> 00:24:16.360
She's no longer alive,
but her book is available,

00:24:16.360 --> 00:24:18.300
and it taught me so much.

00:24:18.300 --> 00:24:20.860
And it's got all
kinds of great stories

00:24:20.860 --> 00:24:24.270
about the folk traditions
that are behind

00:24:24.270 --> 00:24:28.770
a lot of the specific dishes and
the role of religion in Iran,

00:24:28.770 --> 00:24:31.530
and the role of geography,
and how it really

00:24:31.530 --> 00:24:33.500
affected how each
part of the country

00:24:33.500 --> 00:24:36.330
has a very different
regional cuisine.

00:24:36.330 --> 00:24:39.620
It's really written
in a lyrical way.

00:24:39.620 --> 00:24:42.330
It's just beautiful, and
she put some things--

00:24:42.330 --> 00:24:45.150
she's able to express some
things about Persian cuisine

00:24:45.150 --> 00:24:48.830
and Persian culture in
ways that just can't even

00:24:48.830 --> 00:24:50.369
be improved upon.

00:24:50.369 --> 00:24:51.410
JACI BADZIN: That's good.

00:24:51.410 --> 00:24:54.130
Making a note of that one.

00:24:54.130 --> 00:24:58.730
So in this digital
age, technology

00:24:58.730 --> 00:25:01.620
is so ever present,
we're at Google.

00:25:01.620 --> 00:25:04.320
How do you see technology
changing or affecting

00:25:04.320 --> 00:25:07.460
the way that you approach
traditional foods

00:25:07.460 --> 00:25:09.620
or cooking or sharing
the information

00:25:09.620 --> 00:25:14.280
about this rich
history through food?

00:25:14.280 --> 00:25:18.490
LOUISA SHAFIA: Well, I feel
like now it's so easy with video

00:25:18.490 --> 00:25:22.900
to show how you would make a
dish that once was believed

00:25:22.900 --> 00:25:25.090
very, very complicated.

00:25:25.090 --> 00:25:28.160
Like, for example,
something like

00:25:28.160 --> 00:25:30.970
tadig, which is a traditional
part of any Persian meal.

00:25:30.970 --> 00:25:34.460
It's the crispy rice
on the bottom of a pot,

00:25:34.460 --> 00:25:36.943
and it's golden and
it's crisp and it

00:25:36.943 --> 00:25:40.830
tastes like potato chips and
popcorn and fried chicken

00:25:40.830 --> 00:25:41.830
all in one.

00:25:41.830 --> 00:25:46.730
So if you tried to just describe
that in words, it's so subtle,

00:25:46.730 --> 00:25:48.770
and there's so many
different little tips

00:25:48.770 --> 00:25:53.740
that you need to carry out to
actually make it successfully.

00:25:53.740 --> 00:25:56.795
But with a video, there's
so many great instructional

00:25:56.795 --> 00:25:58.890
cooking videos
out there now, you

00:25:58.890 --> 00:26:01.640
can show people exactly how
they can do it and learn

00:26:01.640 --> 00:26:04.710
how to do it like
an expert at home.

00:26:04.710 --> 00:26:06.110
JACI BADZIN: Yeah,
I definitely--

00:26:06.110 --> 00:26:10.730
it's amazing to see how many--
these days, how many people are

00:26:10.730 --> 00:26:13.180
learning to cook from
videos, and people will

00:26:13.180 --> 00:26:15.510
find information online.

00:26:15.510 --> 00:26:17.420
I still have my-- I
love my cookbooks.

00:26:17.420 --> 00:26:20.290
I mean, I will
keep them forever,

00:26:20.290 --> 00:26:24.050
but it's interesting to
see how the two compliment

00:26:24.050 --> 00:26:25.000
each other too.

00:26:25.000 --> 00:26:27.390
It's like book to
video, back to the book,

00:26:27.390 --> 00:26:29.162
when you're cooking
and moving around.

00:26:29.162 --> 00:26:30.620
And there is
something that's still

00:26:30.620 --> 00:26:33.620
so beautiful about having that
book present in your kitchen

00:26:33.620 --> 00:26:36.482
as opposed to a
laptop or your phone.

00:26:36.482 --> 00:26:38.940
You can't really hold your
phone and cook at the same time.

00:26:38.940 --> 00:26:41.930
So it's really-- I think
there's a beauty and essence

00:26:41.930 --> 00:26:44.230
in the cookbooks and
especially in yours.

00:26:44.230 --> 00:26:46.440
The photos are
wonderful, and you

00:26:46.440 --> 00:26:49.407
can tell it's such a
culturally rich book.

00:26:49.407 --> 00:26:50.240
It's really amazing.

00:26:50.240 --> 00:26:51.520
LOUISA SHAFIA: Thank you.

00:26:51.520 --> 00:26:53.780
Just one more thing on
that that I want to say.

00:26:53.780 --> 00:26:56.610
Is also, with
things like Twitter

00:26:56.610 --> 00:26:59.940
and just so much
sharing online, I

00:26:59.940 --> 00:27:03.560
can be talking with people in
Iran and getting recipe tips,

00:27:03.560 --> 00:27:05.440
and asking them
how they do things

00:27:05.440 --> 00:27:07.580
and getting an
immediate response

00:27:07.580 --> 00:27:11.070
and having this dialogue that I
really wouldn't have otherwise.

00:27:11.070 --> 00:27:14.310
It just makes us so much
closer and makes the ability

00:27:14.310 --> 00:27:17.660
to share ideas really easy.

00:27:17.660 --> 00:27:20.420
JACI BADZIN: And tips,
that's really interesting.

00:27:20.420 --> 00:27:21.560
So cool.

00:27:21.560 --> 00:27:26.170
I love that idea of like when
you're cooking something that's

00:27:26.170 --> 00:27:28.750
historically inherited
from a different country,

00:27:28.750 --> 00:27:31.302
a different land,
and using technology

00:27:31.302 --> 00:27:33.760
to get instant information
about like, oh, I'm making this.

00:27:33.760 --> 00:27:34.551
I'm not quite sure.

00:27:34.551 --> 00:27:36.440
Does anybody have
any recommendations?

00:27:36.440 --> 00:27:37.130
And you can.

00:27:37.130 --> 00:27:39.640
You can get information
just instantaneously

00:27:39.640 --> 00:27:41.580
that shifts your entire process.

00:27:41.580 --> 00:27:43.750
It's so interesting.

00:27:43.750 --> 00:27:47.690
So you have two cookbooks,
a catering company,

00:27:47.690 --> 00:27:52.640
you're a food writer, what
is going to be next for you?

00:27:52.640 --> 00:27:57.100
LOUISA SHAFIA: I'm
really thinking about it.

00:27:57.100 --> 00:28:00.170
I feel like I'd like to
bring these flavors to people

00:28:00.170 --> 00:28:04.220
in an easier way, so
I'm working right now

00:28:04.220 --> 00:28:07.850
on getting my papers
in order to visit Iran.

00:28:07.850 --> 00:28:11.020
And, fingers crossed, that's
going to come through soon.

00:28:11.020 --> 00:28:14.750
And if I do, and I'm able to
actually go to the motherland,

00:28:14.750 --> 00:28:16.730
to the source of
all this, I think

00:28:16.730 --> 00:28:20.070
I'm going to go deeper into
this approach to cooking

00:28:20.070 --> 00:28:24.210
in this tradition of things
that come from the Silk Road.

00:28:24.210 --> 00:28:28.600
So I kind of feel like that's
where I'm going, but we'll see.

00:28:28.600 --> 00:28:31.575
I don't want to jinx anything
by saying it to soon.

00:28:31.575 --> 00:28:33.200
JACI BADZIN: Silk
Road, that's amazing.

00:28:33.200 --> 00:28:36.061
I love that thread line through
this too, the ingredients

00:28:36.061 --> 00:28:37.060
and how you tie that in.

00:28:37.060 --> 00:28:38.920
It's really fantastic.

00:28:38.920 --> 00:28:42.400
What is on your
food bucket list?

00:28:42.400 --> 00:28:44.410
JACI BADZIN: Oh, boy.

00:28:44.410 --> 00:28:47.120
Well, one thing I
really want to do

00:28:47.120 --> 00:28:50.630
is after I get deeper
into the Iran thing

00:28:50.630 --> 00:28:53.480
is I'd love to explore
the heritage of my mom's

00:28:53.480 --> 00:28:58.650
side, which is Russian,
German, and Polish.

00:28:58.650 --> 00:29:01.720
And I would love to go
to that part of the world

00:29:01.720 --> 00:29:03.780
and really immerse myself.

00:29:03.780 --> 00:29:06.130
And the interesting
thing that I found,

00:29:06.130 --> 00:29:09.450
which was really surprising
in researching this book,

00:29:09.450 --> 00:29:12.710
is how much those two
areas have in common.

00:29:12.710 --> 00:29:15.170
Because there's been
cultural exchange

00:29:15.170 --> 00:29:18.810
for thousands of years,
whether it be by war

00:29:18.810 --> 00:29:21.440
and conquering or just by trade.

00:29:21.440 --> 00:29:25.630
But I found pickles
and dill and raw onions

00:29:25.630 --> 00:29:30.580
and pickled fish, caviar and
lots of super sour flavors

00:29:30.580 --> 00:29:33.910
all throughout Eastern Europe.

00:29:33.910 --> 00:29:37.920
and then, of course, into
Iran and the Persianate sphere

00:29:37.920 --> 00:29:38.960
of influence.

00:29:38.960 --> 00:29:41.930
So I kind of want to go
to that part of the world

00:29:41.930 --> 00:29:44.570
and see what all the
similarities are.

00:29:44.570 --> 00:29:45.580
JACI BADZIN: Very cool.

00:29:45.580 --> 00:29:47.980
So we've got a couple more
questions left, and we're

00:29:47.980 --> 00:29:50.960
going to open it up
to the Q&amp;A portion.

00:29:50.960 --> 00:29:52.620
So if anybody has
questions, please

00:29:52.620 --> 00:29:56.780
use the microphones that
are in the audience.

00:29:56.780 --> 00:30:00.690
So I like to wrap things
up with a off the cuff

00:30:00.690 --> 00:30:03.110
portion, finish this sentence.

00:30:03.110 --> 00:30:05.230
So there's a few questions.

00:30:05.230 --> 00:30:09.030
I'm inspired by--

00:30:09.030 --> 00:30:14.010
LOUISA SHAFIA: Yotam Ottolenghi,
the author-- the co-author

00:30:14.010 --> 00:30:17.200
with Sammi Tamimi, the
cookbook "Jerusalem."

00:30:17.200 --> 00:30:19.920
I love how the two
of them have brought

00:30:19.920 --> 00:30:24.210
this really exotic flavors to
a bigger audience in a really

00:30:24.210 --> 00:30:27.290
beautiful, easy
to understand way.

00:30:27.290 --> 00:30:30.170
And I think they've kind of
changed the whole dialogue

00:30:30.170 --> 00:30:31.180
about cooking here.

00:30:31.180 --> 00:30:34.640
Suddenly, everybody's super
into Middle Eastern cooking.

00:30:34.640 --> 00:30:36.050
JACI BADZIN: Fantastic.

00:30:36.050 --> 00:30:40.180
Three things that are
always in my fridge are--

00:30:40.180 --> 00:30:45.820
LOUISA SHAFIA: Peanut butter,
miso paste, and tamarind pure.

00:30:45.820 --> 00:30:48.985
JACI BADZIN: I don't know
if those three go together,

00:30:48.985 --> 00:30:51.110
but I bet she could make
something very interesting

00:30:51.110 --> 00:30:51.560
with them.

00:30:51.560 --> 00:30:52.559
LOUISA SHAFIA: They can.

00:30:52.559 --> 00:30:56.700
They all will kick up the
flavor of a bowl of ramen.

00:30:56.700 --> 00:30:58.276
JACI BADZIN: That's amazing.

00:30:58.276 --> 00:31:00.860
I'm going to try that.

00:31:00.860 --> 00:31:04.880
When no one is watching, I eat--

00:31:04.880 --> 00:31:06.800
LOUISA SHAFIA: A
big bowl of soup

00:31:06.800 --> 00:31:09.395
that has peanut
butter and miso in it

00:31:09.395 --> 00:31:12.710
and all different kinds of
vegetables like winter squash

00:31:12.710 --> 00:31:19.170
and shiitakes and scallions
and ginger and carrots.

00:31:19.170 --> 00:31:21.090
JACI BADZIN: That
sounds really good.

00:31:21.090 --> 00:31:22.900
LOUISA SHAFIA: Had
it this morning.

00:31:22.900 --> 00:31:25.140
JACI BADZIN: If I weren't
a chef, I would be--

00:31:32.610 --> 00:31:39.660
LOUISA SHAFIA: I guess, I
would be a full-time writer.

00:31:39.660 --> 00:31:42.200
JACI BADZIN: I can see
you on your way to that.

00:31:42.200 --> 00:31:43.450
LOUISA SHAFIA: An academician.

00:31:43.450 --> 00:31:45.530
I should be more exact.

00:31:45.530 --> 00:31:51.220
I guess, I would delve deeply
into food history and really

00:31:51.220 --> 00:31:54.302
the theories and the
foundations of everything.

00:31:54.302 --> 00:31:55.760
JACI BADZIN: Very interesting.

00:31:55.760 --> 00:31:57.470
Last question.

00:31:57.470 --> 00:32:02.700
When Jaci comes to my house for
dinner, I'm going to make her--

00:32:02.700 --> 00:32:06.300
LOUISA SHAFIA: I am going
to make her Persian rice

00:32:06.300 --> 00:32:12.910
pie, which is rice with a
layer of cooked chicken,

00:32:12.910 --> 00:32:16.450
roasted chicken, and
yogurt and barberries,

00:32:16.450 --> 00:32:20.170
and then another layer of
rice on top cooked to a crisp

00:32:20.170 --> 00:32:23.090
so the top is covered
with the golden tadig

00:32:23.090 --> 00:32:25.790
and the inside is tender.

00:32:25.790 --> 00:32:31.737
And it's comforting,
it's rich, it's savory.

00:32:31.737 --> 00:32:32.820
JACI BADZIN: I can't wait.

00:32:32.820 --> 00:32:34.569
LOUISA SHAFIA: It's
special occasion food.

00:32:34.569 --> 00:32:36.514
I'm going to make it for you.

00:32:36.514 --> 00:32:37.930
JACI BADZIN: Well,
thanks so much.

00:32:37.930 --> 00:32:39.470
We have a question over here.

00:32:42.000 --> 00:32:42.780
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:32:42.780 --> 00:32:45.280
First, I want us to say how I'm
kind of excited to see this,

00:32:45.280 --> 00:32:47.340
because it seemed for
years that, at least

00:32:47.340 --> 00:32:49.670
in English language, it was
kind of legendary cuisine.

00:32:49.670 --> 00:32:52.101
Persia was the only cookbook
that really was available

00:32:52.101 --> 00:32:52.850
that I could find.

00:32:52.850 --> 00:32:54.010
LOUISA SHAFIA: Oh, you
know about that book?

00:32:54.010 --> 00:32:54.880
AUDIENCE: Yeah, totally I know.

00:32:54.880 --> 00:32:57.510
It's an awesome cookbook,
but I'm excited to see more.

00:32:57.510 --> 00:32:59.900
I guess, when I think of
Iran, the first thing that

00:32:59.900 --> 00:33:02.080
comes to other people's
minds is saffron.

00:33:02.080 --> 00:33:04.220
They produce one of the
world's best saffron

00:33:04.220 --> 00:33:06.370
and I was kind of
actually surprised you can

00:33:06.370 --> 00:33:08.650
apparently what claims to
be Iranian saffron here

00:33:08.650 --> 00:33:11.700
in the US, which I wouldn't
have thought was legal.

00:33:11.700 --> 00:33:13.760
But where do you
think-- where should I

00:33:13.760 --> 00:33:18.440
go to get really the best
saffron that I can find?

00:33:18.440 --> 00:33:20.779
Do1 you mean here in New
York or just in general?

00:33:20.779 --> 00:33:21.570
AUDIENCE: Whatever.

00:33:21.570 --> 00:33:22.545
Here in New York.

00:33:22.545 --> 00:33:23.170
Let's try that.

00:33:23.170 --> 00:33:24.500
JACI BADZIN: Let's
start here in New York.

00:33:24.500 --> 00:33:26.083
LOUISA SHAFIA: Well,
here in New York,

00:33:26.083 --> 00:33:28.110
I usually go to Kalustyan's.

00:33:28.110 --> 00:33:29.985
AUDIENCE: Yeah, that's
where I would go.

00:33:29.985 --> 00:33:31.160
JACI BADZIN: It's amazing.

00:33:31.160 --> 00:33:36.280
LOUISA SHAFIA: But, you know,
you could also-- does Penzeys

00:33:36.280 --> 00:33:38.000
still have a store in New York?

00:33:38.000 --> 00:33:41.940
Penzeys, the mail-order spice
company, did they close?

00:33:41.940 --> 00:33:44.770
Oh, that's too bad, because
they have such high quality

00:33:44.770 --> 00:33:47.590
ingredients, even things
like sumac or saffron.

00:33:47.590 --> 00:33:49.845
I would go to them first
because they're really fresh

00:33:49.845 --> 00:33:51.012
and they know their sources.

00:33:51.012 --> 00:33:52.886
AUDIENCE: So I guess
there's no secret places

00:33:52.886 --> 00:33:54.980
like in the Iranian
community where they like--

00:33:54.980 --> 00:33:58.780
LOUISA SHAFIA: Well,
now that you've asked.

00:33:58.780 --> 00:34:02.750
You could go out to
Great Neck, Long Island,

00:34:02.750 --> 00:34:07.030
where there's a big
community of Persian-Jews,

00:34:07.030 --> 00:34:09.690
and there's grocery stores
and there's restaurants.

00:34:09.690 --> 00:34:12.760
So you might, if you paid
off the right person,

00:34:12.760 --> 00:34:15.530
be able to get some real
authentic Iranian saffron.

00:34:15.530 --> 00:34:16.710
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:34:16.710 --> 00:34:17.860
JACI BADZIN: Nice.

00:34:17.860 --> 00:34:19.739
Well, thank you so
much for coming in.

00:34:19.739 --> 00:34:22.830
This is so fantastic to get
to have you here and talk

00:34:22.830 --> 00:34:24.730
about this beautiful book.

00:34:24.730 --> 00:34:26.570
LOUISA SHAFIA: Thanks Jaci.
