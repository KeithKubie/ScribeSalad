1
00:00:00,990 --> 00:00:04,950
The Joe Rogan experience you anticipating
seeing like a lot of freaky things

2
00:00:04,951 --> 00:00:08,910
come out of China? Yes. Whoa. You said
that very quick. Yeah, no, it's true.

3
00:00:08,911 --> 00:00:13,620
I suppose I spend, I spend a
lot of time in China. I in this,

4
00:00:13,950 --> 00:00:15,840
it's a different meeting,
but the thing with China,

5
00:00:15,870 --> 00:00:18,570
China had this great ancient civilization,

6
00:00:19,110 --> 00:00:24,110
but they destroyed their own civilization
in the great leap forward and the

7
00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:25,740
Cultural Revolution. They,
they burned their books,

8
00:00:25,741 --> 00:00:29,610
they smashed their own at historic
relics and so it's really,

9
00:00:29,611 --> 00:00:34,230
it's a society in many ways it's starting
from scratch and so all of these norms

10
00:00:34,231 --> 00:00:36,870
that people get inherit
through their traditions.

11
00:00:37,110 --> 00:00:41,100
China in many ways doesn't
have and so and so it's,

12
00:00:41,101 --> 00:00:42,300
it's a very different,

13
00:00:42,620 --> 00:00:47,620
and China is growing Monday
are increasingly powerful
in China is going to be a

14
00:00:48,511 --> 00:00:52,260
major Foyt at forest defining
the world of the 21st century.

15
00:00:52,261 --> 00:00:53,910
That's why America has
to get its act together.

16
00:00:54,060 --> 00:00:55,680
That's a hard concept for us to grasp.

17
00:00:55,681 --> 00:00:58,710
When we think about the fact that they
had the Great Wall and they have so much

18
00:00:58,711 --> 00:01:03,690
ancient art and architecture, we just
assume they're a really old culture.

19
00:01:03,720 --> 00:01:08,580
They are, but they wiped it out. That's
crazy. That's why if you want to see,

20
00:01:08,850 --> 00:01:12,630
if you want to see great Chinese art,
you have to go to Taiwan.

21
00:01:12,990 --> 00:01:16,650
Because when the Chinese nationalists
left in 1949 when they lost,

22
00:01:16,780 --> 00:01:18,570
as they were losing the civil war,

23
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:23,220
they took the treasures and they put
them in the National Museum of Taiwan in

24
00:01:23,221 --> 00:01:25,930
the the cultural revolution,
the great leap forward. China,

25
00:01:25,950 --> 00:01:29,010
the red guards were just
smashing all of their own stuff,

26
00:01:29,011 --> 00:01:33,330
their own ancient history. Now, now the
Chinese Communist Party is saying, oh no,

27
00:01:33,331 --> 00:01:36,690
we're going back and we have this
great 5,000 year old culture.

28
00:01:36,691 --> 00:01:37,710
And some ways it's true,

29
00:01:37,711 --> 00:01:42,540
but in some ways it's like an adolescent
culture without these kinds of

30
00:01:42,541 --> 00:01:44,070
restrictions that other societies have.

31
00:01:44,190 --> 00:01:47,310
That's such a unique perspective
that I haven't heard before.

32
00:01:48,010 --> 00:01:52,290
It makes so much sense in terms of like
how frantic they are restructuring their

33
00:01:52,291 --> 00:01:53,580
world. Yeah. Yeah. And,

34
00:01:53,581 --> 00:01:56,910
and they feel that they got screwed
over because there is this, this vague,

35
00:01:56,970 --> 00:02:00,000
the sense of Chinese greatness.
When you hear the word middle kingdom,

36
00:02:00,001 --> 00:02:02,480
it's like China as the center of
the world and everybody else's,

37
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:04,170
some kind of of tributary.

38
00:02:04,590 --> 00:02:09,590
And so their monumentally pissed off
that these colonial powers came and

39
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:12,870
overpowered them and they had to
make all of these concessions.

40
00:02:12,871 --> 00:02:17,780
They had to give land away and and
hell bent on Regainey gaining that are

41
00:02:17,790 --> 00:02:18,810
playing the long game.

42
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:21,750
They are playing a long game and we have
to be and we are not and we have to be

43
00:02:21,751 --> 00:02:22,440
mindful of it.

44
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:26,040
That's also something you can do if you
have complete control of your population.

45
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:29,910
You don't have to worry about people's
opinions or you can just go in the

46
00:02:29,911 --> 00:02:33,930
direction that you feel is
going to benefit the Chinese
power, the power that be,

47
00:02:34,010 --> 00:02:35,940
wait,
this is a country run by engineers.

48
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:40,590
We per country run largely by lawyers
and, and, and reality TV people I guess.

49
00:02:40,850 --> 00:02:42,720
Um,
but in China it's run by engineers.

50
00:02:42,721 --> 00:02:45,360
So there are all these problems and
the answer is always engineering.

51
00:02:45,361 --> 00:02:47,880
So if you have a population problem,
it's the answers,

52
00:02:47,910 --> 00:02:51,710
the one child policy environmental
problem. You have Three Gorges Dam there.

53
00:02:51,711 --> 00:02:53,550
You don't have water
in the north of China.

54
00:02:53,551 --> 00:02:57,750
You build this massive biggest water
project in the world from south to north.

55
00:02:57,751 --> 00:03:01,420
You want to win the Olympics,
you engineer your population,

56
00:03:01,421 --> 00:03:04,180
you take kids away from their families
and put them in their Olympic sports

57
00:03:04,181 --> 00:03:06,430
school.
So I write about this in Genesis Code.

58
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:10,960
If you're China and you kind of have
this Plato's republic model of the world

59
00:03:10,961 --> 00:03:14,500
and we're going to kind of identify
the genetic or maybe manipulate these

60
00:03:14,501 --> 00:03:18,910
genetic superstars to be our greatest
scientists and mathematicians and business

61
00:03:18,911 --> 00:03:20,020
leaders and political leaders,

62
00:03:20,590 --> 00:03:25,280
like there is a model that you can
imagine for for how to do it. Wow.

63
00:03:25,540 --> 00:03:29,530
It makes you really
nervous. It should, yes.

64
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:35,170
That's why like I just feel
like with this country,

65
00:03:35,171 --> 00:03:38,830
we don't have time to have
all of these distractions.

66
00:03:38,831 --> 00:03:43,720
We're focusing on junk. Like what
it just like all of this, you,

67
00:03:43,790 --> 00:03:46,120
I'm on CNN all the time when I'm,

68
00:03:46,121 --> 00:03:48,610
when I'm home in New York and
I always say like you guys,

69
00:03:48,940 --> 00:03:52,420
and I'm talking about kind of geopolitical
issues, China and North Korea.

70
00:03:52,950 --> 00:03:57,050
And when I would say it's like you guys
recognize this is porn like CNN and MSGB.

71
00:03:57,070 --> 00:04:01,900
That's like one kind of porn and Fox
and, and whoever else, info wars.

72
00:04:01,901 --> 00:04:05,410
That's another kind of porn.
But it's all porn and we're just kind of,

73
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:09,190
we're drawing people's
attention to these few stories.

74
00:04:09,550 --> 00:04:14,440
But there's these big stories that we
have to focus on and certainly the rise of

75
00:04:14,441 --> 00:04:19,441
China is such an essential story for the
21st century because China is competing

76
00:04:20,470 --> 00:04:23,950
in all of these technologies.
And China, it's like go, go, go.

77
00:04:23,980 --> 00:04:26,680
I mean people in China who were
involved in the tech world,

78
00:04:27,070 --> 00:04:30,370
when they go and visit silicon
valley uniformly, they say,

79
00:04:30,371 --> 00:04:32,560
we cannot believe these
people are so lazy.

80
00:04:32,890 --> 00:04:35,650
Like why are they not
working 24 hours a day?

81
00:04:35,651 --> 00:04:40,000
Why are they not issuing product
new products every, uh, every week?

82
00:04:40,001 --> 00:04:40,834
And so this is,

83
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:46,200
I mean they are racing somewhere and
it's going to have huge implications for

84
00:04:46,781 --> 00:04:50,440
the world. And so if we believe in our
values is that I believe we should,

85
00:04:50,860 --> 00:04:51,760
we have to fight for him.

86
00:04:51,761 --> 00:04:56,020
And the place that we have to fight for
him first is here and we can't, you know,

87
00:04:56,021 --> 00:05:00,620
it's just like every day that we're
just focusing on this, this drama,

88
00:05:00,621 --> 00:05:05,020
this reality TV drama of our government
is another day where we're not focusing

89
00:05:05,021 --> 00:05:07,030
on the big things.
How are we going to get our act together?

90
00:05:07,030 --> 00:05:09,610
How are we going to lead the
world and technology? I mean,

91
00:05:09,611 --> 00:05:12,370
if another example is this is immigration,

92
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:14,560
like we have this whole fight
of how do we keep people out?

93
00:05:14,561 --> 00:05:17,770
What I'd like to do is to go to to
the State Department's all right,

94
00:05:17,771 --> 00:05:21,070
every embassy in the world, you
have a new job, you have to,

95
00:05:21,071 --> 00:05:23,770
we're going to give you whatever,
a number 500 slots per year.

96
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:28,210
You have to in your country find
the 500 most brilliant, talented,

97
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:32,650
creative, entrepreneurial people and
say, we're giving you a green card.

98
00:05:33,350 --> 00:05:34,720
We're going to give you
a little starter money.

99
00:05:34,721 --> 00:05:39,580
We want you to move to the United States
and just start a life and have kids.

100
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:42,340
And if we we,
we should be creaming the crop,

101
00:05:42,580 --> 00:05:46,790
skimming the cream over the rest of the
world. I think we could take over, we,

102
00:05:46,910 --> 00:05:48,580
we could revitalize this country,

103
00:05:48,581 --> 00:05:53,581
but we're having this fight of how do we
keep a small number of refugees out and

104
00:05:53,681 --> 00:05:58,280
it's just we're not focusing on the right
things. That's a, that's again another

105
00:05:58,280 --> 00:06:01,320
very, very interesting
perspective. We are,

106
00:06:01,370 --> 00:06:05,240
we learned about Huawei in
this country really. Not just,

107
00:06:05,241 --> 00:06:08,450
well I learned about it because they put
out some pretty innovative phones and

108
00:06:08,520 --> 00:06:12,800
some interesting technology but we learned
it because the State Department was

109
00:06:12,801 --> 00:06:14,600
telling people to stop using their phones.
Yep.

110
00:06:15,110 --> 00:06:19,070
Do you think that that is trying
to stifle the competition?

111
00:06:19,140 --> 00:06:21,440
Like to try it like cause cause
the market share that they have,

112
00:06:21,441 --> 00:06:26,441
if they do really have the number two
selling cell phones in the world now

113
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:30,770
that's not from America. America is
largely out of that conversation. Right.

114
00:06:31,460 --> 00:06:32,870
And if they were in America,

115
00:06:32,900 --> 00:06:36,500
they would probably dominate in America
as well because they're cheaper. Yeah.

116
00:06:36,501 --> 00:06:40,220
And they're really good. Yeah. I mean
[inaudible] they're phones are insane.

117
00:06:40,221 --> 00:06:42,740
They're, the cameras in their
phones are off the charts.

118
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:45,740
They put some video of the,

119
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:50,660
the zoom capability of their newest
phone and people were calling bullshit.

120
00:06:50,661 --> 00:06:53,990
There's like, there's no way that's not
impossible, but it turned out it was true.

121
00:06:54,170 --> 00:06:58,720
It really can. It really can zoom like
an a super expensive telephoto Lens.

122
00:06:59,060 --> 00:07:03,010
Yeah. Yeah. So Huawei,
it's a complicated stew.

123
00:07:03,011 --> 00:07:04,150
I for sure.

124
00:07:04,180 --> 00:07:09,160
The founder of Walway is a former
Chinese military officer for sure. Sure.

125
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:11,800
In the early stages of their company,

126
00:07:11,980 --> 00:07:16,980
they stole straight out stole lots of
source code from companies like Cisco.

127
00:07:18,190 --> 00:07:22,020
Um, for sure we should
be really worried if, um,

128
00:07:22,210 --> 00:07:27,210
Walway is the sole supplier of the
infrastructure that supports 5g all around

129
00:07:27,851 --> 00:07:32,680
the world because that Chinese government
would have access to everything.

130
00:07:32,681 --> 00:07:34,480
And so that leads us to the question is,
one,

131
00:07:35,290 --> 00:07:38,960
is there a problem with
Walway itself? Um, and,

132
00:07:38,970 --> 00:07:40,780
but then two is let's just say,

133
00:07:40,781 --> 00:07:45,050
and I inciting the answer to that
first question is probably yes. Um,

134
00:07:45,550 --> 00:07:50,050
but then the question too is let's
just say Huawei is a legit company and

135
00:07:50,051 --> 00:07:53,920
they're not totally intimately
connected to the Chinese government.

136
00:07:54,370 --> 00:07:57,280
Can we trust their relationship
with the Chinese government?

137
00:07:57,280 --> 00:08:00,940
And the Chinese government has a rule
that every one of these companies has the

138
00:08:00,941 --> 00:08:03,760
big Chinese national companies,
national champion companies,

139
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:08,470
they have a communist party
sell inside of that company.

140
00:08:08,740 --> 00:08:09,880
And so these,
like,

141
00:08:09,881 --> 00:08:13,900
I think that we can't think of big
Chinese companies just like we think of

142
00:08:13,901 --> 00:08:18,100
companies here. We have to think
of them as quasi state actors.

143
00:08:18,101 --> 00:08:21,940
And that's why this, this fight that's
happening right now is, is so important.

144
00:08:21,941 --> 00:08:25,780
And that's why like when China is out
investing in different parts of the world,

145
00:08:25,781 --> 00:08:26,620
including Africa,

146
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:30,910
their companies are kind of acting
like arms of the government.

147
00:08:30,930 --> 00:08:35,320
I mean they're making all kinds of
investments that don't really make sense.

148
00:08:35,380 --> 00:08:37,510
If you just see,
well this is a company doing something.

149
00:08:37,511 --> 00:08:41,680
If you say that this is a company with
backing by the state that's fulfilling a

150
00:08:41,681 --> 00:08:45,850
function that supports the state. It's,
it's just, it's a very different model.

151
00:08:45,851 --> 00:08:50,710
So I, I am actually quite concerned
about, uh, about hallway and,

152
00:08:50,711 --> 00:08:53,800
and I'm not a fan of everything
that this administration is doing,

153
00:08:53,801 --> 00:08:54,880
but I think on,
on China,

154
00:08:54,881 --> 00:08:59,400
it's that we need to stand up and I
think pushing back on Huawei is the right

155
00:08:59,401 --> 00:09:02,340
thing to do. I'm uncomfortable
about this for two reasons. One,

156
00:09:02,341 --> 00:09:03,690
I'm uncomfortable about that,

157
00:09:03,750 --> 00:09:07,940
about the Chinese government being
inexorably connected to this global super

158
00:09:07,941 --> 00:09:08,970
power in technology,

159
00:09:09,300 --> 00:09:14,130
but I'm also uncomfortable that it sets
a precedent for other nations to follow.

160
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:15,040
Yeah. Because they're like, look,

161
00:09:15,050 --> 00:09:18,030
as the only way to compete because what
you were talking about the investments

162
00:09:18,031 --> 00:09:22,380
that Walway or that the Chinese government
makes in these other, these countries.

163
00:09:22,381 --> 00:09:25,350
And that don't seem to make sense if
you're just dealing with a company, right.

164
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:29,100
But if you're dealing with someone who's
trying to take over the world, yeah.

165
00:09:29,250 --> 00:09:30,360
It makes a lot of sense.

166
00:09:30,890 --> 00:09:34,020
And so when we have our companies that
you're out in some place in Africa and

167
00:09:34,021 --> 00:09:38,130
you're competing with a Chinese
company and to do something,

168
00:09:38,131 --> 00:09:39,330
build a port or whatever,

169
00:09:39,750 --> 00:09:44,040
and you're competing because you are an
American company and so you have your

170
00:09:44,041 --> 00:09:46,950
CAC, I this is the poor, what's the
income stream going to be about it?

171
00:09:46,951 --> 00:09:50,880
And you have a certain amount that you
can bid because otherwise it becomes a

172
00:09:50,881 --> 00:09:55,230
bad investment. But if the Chinese
company is that their calculus is not,

173
00:09:55,231 --> 00:09:56,880
is this a good or bad investment?

174
00:09:56,881 --> 00:10:01,650
It's what is the state interest in
controlling or caused by controlling this

175
00:10:01,651 --> 00:10:02,484
asset.

176
00:10:02,610 --> 00:10:07,110
And so that's why we can't project
ourselves onto the Chinese.

177
00:10:07,111 --> 00:10:09,590
We can't say they're just like us.
Just different.

178
00:10:09,810 --> 00:10:11,940
We have different models and
our models are competing.

179
00:10:12,150 --> 00:10:16,100
Do you think that we should avoid while
we products like consumer? Should I, well,

180
00:10:16,110 --> 00:10:20,810
I think the government should
very tightly regulate, um,

181
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:25,150
products like Huawei products
because some of their network, uh,

182
00:10:25,260 --> 00:10:28,590
look routers or, exactly.
They've shown that they,

183
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:32,580
they're using them to extract information.
And so we've,

184
00:10:32,581 --> 00:10:35,430
we have a long history of European,
Japanese,

185
00:10:35,431 --> 00:10:38,400
South Korean companies that
have invested very well.

186
00:10:38,401 --> 00:10:40,770
They've out competed us and we've,
we've allowed,

187
00:10:40,771 --> 00:10:44,640
we allowed the Japanese companies to
outcompete our auto manufacturers.

188
00:10:44,850 --> 00:10:48,780
And that was, that was fine in
the sense it are in the 1970s,

189
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:53,070
our cars had become shit
because we had this monopoly.

190
00:10:53,100 --> 00:10:57,180
And so I'm all for open competition.
I'm all for free trade.

191
00:10:57,181 --> 00:11:00,420
It has to be fair.
But I think that what China is doing,

192
00:11:00,421 --> 00:11:05,421
China recognized as a state that they
could use the tools of capitalism to

193
00:11:06,841 --> 00:11:09,840
achieve state ends. And I think we
need to be very cautious about that.

194
00:11:10,350 --> 00:11:13,110
That's interesting that you'd compare
it to the automotive market because the

195
00:11:13,111 --> 00:11:15,030
consequences are so much different.
Right.

196
00:11:15,060 --> 00:11:17,790
So much different cause but
we do have a model to go on.

197
00:11:17,791 --> 00:11:20,310
We could see what happened.
We did, we made shitty cars.

198
00:11:20,311 --> 00:11:23,250
The Japanese took over and
then we made better cars.

199
00:11:23,251 --> 00:11:27,750
Like I have a rental car here. I'm
in Los Angeles. And I went to the,

200
00:11:27,780 --> 00:11:30,480
to the, um, the rental
car place said at lax,

201
00:11:30,990 --> 00:11:34,290
and they had all of the different
cars and there was like a,

202
00:11:34,920 --> 00:11:39,360
a Nissan and Toyota, and there was a
Cadillac. And for the fact that, you know,

203
00:11:39,361 --> 00:11:43,240
I said, I'm going to go with the
caddy. So it's a great car inside.

204
00:11:43,241 --> 00:11:47,790
They're amazing. Incredible. The American
cars are very good now. They're great.

205
00:11:48,090 --> 00:11:51,810
And then so like, I'm all for competition,
but I just feel like what Chinese,

206
00:11:51,811 --> 00:11:56,380
some Chinese companies are, it's not
competition. It's, they have become,

207
00:11:56,500 --> 00:12:00,340
not all of them, but quasi state actors
and gift. That's what they're doing.

208
00:12:00,341 --> 00:12:03,940
I think we need to respond to
them in that way. Interesting.

209
00:12:08,650 --> 00:12:11,320
[inaudible].
