Speaker 1:          00:00          Hey, I'm Jad Abumrad. I'm Robert Krulwich Radiolab. Today we're going to start off with a building, not just any building, but a building that is heavy with secrets and it's a building we first really learned about, or at least got a picture of from this woman Katie Engelhart. I'm a reporter at Vice News in London, in Katy. Like now, all of us at radio lab is obsessed devastatingly obsessed with this place called Hansel o park. So Hansel park is this huge sprawling complex in Buckinghamshire near a town called Milton keens, which isn't too far from London. And our producer Jamie Yorke, check, check, check happened to be in London on vacation. So we asked them, well, why don't you scrap your tape recorder and go down there? Yeah, let's do this. Check it out. So it's a bit of a drive from London, about an hour and a half on the m one m two you approached this, this sort of beautiful town with adorable little posh cottages and little pubs. Not from around here. I'm looking for, yeah, I mean it's, it's your sort of typical e all day British village. About a four minute drive past that new old town. You go through some fields, crest over a hill and there it is. This massive, massive buildings surrounded by razor wire. What's going on here? So the archives are housed in a purpose belt belting from the 90s and these are archives, by the way, from the largest empire ever known. It's like if you were creating a movie set for like a secret government compound where they keep secret files, you would literally just make this

Speaker 2:          01:47          Jamie parked a quarter mile away and walked up to the gate. There's some pig, looks like electrified fence through the gate, taller than me pass these traffic spikes and just as he barely stepped inside, are you going to call to call with? No, I'm no comfortable with any of this activity you're doing. The guard grabs him, takes him to a guard house. That is, it's a microphone disconnected. While you're in here though, please. And then where is your vehicle? Right. Okay. They walk him. Are you going to escort me all the way back to my car the entire quarter mile back to his car.

Speaker 1:          02:28          Now we've heard it said that the files in that building, if they were ever released, could rewrite 200 years of history. No idea if that's true, we just don't know. But we're starting to know, and today we're going to focus on the one story that has so far anyway, tumbled out kind of by accident. And it's a story that we find kind of startling and we should also warn that there's some stuff coming up that is graphic and disturbing. So if you're listening with

Speaker 3:          03:00          kids, you might want to skip this one. Although if you're not listening with kids, don't skip it. Don't skip it. Okay.

Speaker 4:          03:14          [inaudible]

Speaker 5:          03:14          a story is the Puna.

Speaker 3:          03:16          Kenya was always a scene. This is a story in David Anderson and a kind of Sepia tinted Hays.

Speaker 5:          03:22          Many of you guys are go Kim white band of adventure pioneers who found the country beautiful. The climate kind on the soil per tile.

Speaker 3:          03:31          Bougainvillea sunshines smiling, happy servants. David says in the 1910s twenties thirties the British public was obsessed with Kenya. You had books, eventually television programs. It was one of the crown jewels of the empire. And so you had all of these Brits leaving Britain and going to Kenya to start a new life. And many, many of the settlers who flopped out to Kenya were lower middle classes who could have a much better salary and a much better living standard in Kenya than they ever could back at home.

Speaker 5:          03:59          They stayed and found of the young culinary where men make the homes where that children are born, taught and grow strong and healthy.

Speaker 6:          04:08          Now it probably goes without saying that this new life for the Britta citizen came at the expense of the Kenyan who was already living there to problems that were always encountered in Africa and in general with colonization is the issue of land in the issue of labor. That's Harvard historian, Carolina Elkins. She'll play a big role in our story. So in Kenya they solve the land problem by simply alienating it and giving it to the white farmers, but then becomes the labor problem. How do you force Africans to labor cheaply on plantations, right? Like in this case, tea and coffee? Well, the way you do it is you create what are called native reserves. We had them here for four native Americans. She basically says that the native Kenyans were forced off of their land into slums where they could barely eke out a living. And so the only option they had was to work for the white people.

Speaker 3:          04:54          And that's how it went for, for decades until the second war

Speaker 5:          04:58          or act as the question has started, all cards gather

Speaker 6:          05:03          in 1939 suddenly thousands and thousands of men, young Kenyan men are forced in the war. The people of Africa are doing excellent work to help the allied cause many get thrown into the British army, you kings African rifles and among the finest troops in the empire where they came in contact with ideas of independence and they anticipated when they returned

Speaker 4:          05:26          the day that they're, that they

Speaker 6:          05:31          would have access to land, that their conditions would be getting better. But nope, they, uh, they find their condition is not only not gotten better, it's gotten worse.

Speaker 3:          05:43          And so after the war, a few of these vets from the largest ethnic group in Kenya called the Kikuyu, they get together and they decided to take an oath.

Speaker 6:          05:55          No owning is traditional amongst

Speaker 7:          05:58          the Kikuyu. So for example, men a hundred years ago or more would take an oath pledging allegiance to their ethnic group as they went to war with somebody else. In this case, they'd take an oath pledging themselves to kick all Europeans out of the colony. Then the earth good, something like this. I pledge to kick all Europeans out of the colony, uh, out of Kenya. And if I don't, may this oath kill me. I pledge to take up arms against the Europeans if I don't make this, Oh, kill me. Now of course, the last thing that was said always was, if I reveal the contents of this oath, may this oath kill me.

Speaker 7:          06:32          She says, the first thing they did was attack the settlers livestock, doing things like hamstring cattle, hamstringing cattle cut their hamstrings, your hamstrings, so they can't walk. They started destroying property. Their oath started to involve things like goat eyeballs, Ram, scrotums and tested blood. Things that absolutely a, the local European settlers and put terror into them. And why do they end up calling themselves the Mal Mal? Well, that's a good question. It's the etymology of that as much debated, um, with nobody quite agreeing on, on how it, how it came to pass. But Malmo is many thing. Is this why he only derivative of sort of more and more that there's, you know, um, uh, some say it has to do with you [inaudible] I don't play this one over hearing what was the Malmo Oath, whatever the case in 1952,

Speaker 8:          07:23          [inaudible]

Speaker 7:          07:24          colonial government, which was served the British arm in Kenya, they declare a state of emergency and those pudgy and legions to the Malmo, they escalate. They start going after the loyalists. The Kenyans had been helping the settlers

Speaker 6:          07:36          savagely attacking the defense that shooting them or they weren't at the monitoring one assassination after the next men and women were, their bodies are whatever they raid loyalists, villages with club [inaudible] in the British or they're terrified, oh, sorry. In the streets of Naomi, this is the night of the long nights coming to into reality and it's only about to get worse.

Speaker 7:          07:58          And that happens on the night of January 24th, 1953, which was the murder of the RUC family. The rucks were these very young, lovely couple. Roger Rock was a farmer as me. Ruck was a doctor who actually administered to the local population and they had a little boy named Michael who was six. Just that day, the little boy had fallen off his pony and his one of their trusted servants carried him back up to the house. Later that night, a group of Mamao crept out of the forest, lured Roger Nesbie ruck out of the house, killed them, and then the whole gang, including that same servant that had helped the boy, they march into the house, go up to the little boys room and they hack them to death and there's a very famous photo of the young boys dead, absolutely buddied, which is an every major newspaper and almost overnight mal mal becomes synonymous with pure evil in our mind, in children's mind. Mauer bigger than life,

Speaker 1:          08:56          darkest, dark people that you ever saw. Men, men, men, men, men. Yeah. And actually as we were reporting this story, one of our producers, a lot of Nasser told us about how his mom grew up next door to Kenya in what is now called Tanzania Jack. And to her and her friends, the Malmo were like like a monster to children. The boogeyman, that was sort of a threat all the time. Our barrier, our mothers especially would refer to if if you don't drink your milk or if you don't sleep [inaudible] hey my mama. Okay. Bolani so the Mama will come and get ya. And how scared were you? You know what? Just the word Mau would make us run, crawl under the bed. I'm old enough to be one of the people who thought that there were a calming [inaudible]. They were like a isis or some weird sort of self organizing terrorist group.

Speaker 1:          09:54          Yes. The most peace Geo horrible, awful savage movement that I had ever hit the face of the British empire. Okay, so here's where we get to the part of the story that is in deep flux. After the murder of the rock family, the settlers demanded that the colonial government do something and they did. They pursued the Malmo fighters, supposedly small band of fighters into the forest. Uh, there were skirmishes that lasted for years. Story goes, the Malmo Movement never quite gained traction and ultimately the British quelled the rebellion. They handled it. Now as for how they handled it for the longest times, people would look back. It was this giant blank spot. No one quite knew what happened. And here's why. According to David Anderson, by the time the British finally decided to leave Kenya, and this is 1963, by that

Speaker 9:          10:42          time, Kenya is around the 20th different colony that Britain will leave. So it's about halfway down the list. So there's already in place a process.

Speaker 5:          10:53          Kathy, well Hello Stadium. The articles of independence were handed by the Duke to the country's prime minister.

Speaker 1:          10:59          There's a formal exchange of powers. They set off fireworks and then

Speaker 5:          11:04          at midnight they union. Jack was low at about the last time,

Speaker 1:          11:07          the Brits Rollout, in other words, date run us Ruth and colorful and happy exit. And at some point in that well-worn exit process either right before the exit, right afterwards there was, as David calls it, the weeding of documents. I mean the British government conducted very, very sophisticated purge operations in all of its former colonies. It's Katie Inglehart again, she says everywhere you look, Uganda, Palestine, Rhodesia, Zanzibar, Nigeria, Jordan, Malaya, Hong Kong. There are stories of papers being kind of tightly packed into boxes and dropped at sea. A lot of papers were burned.

Speaker 9:          11:47          There's a joke in among Indian historians on the day the India achieved its independence when the celebrations

Speaker 7:          11:54          were taking place in Delhi. You could hardly see what was going on on the podium cause the waft of smoke blowing across from the bonfires of burning documents. All of which is to say that it was, you know, as soon for 30 years did that blank spot of the Mal mal emergency would just stay blank and the story of the Evil Malmo, which is continue because there were no documents to say otherwise. But then we get to Carolina Elkins. How did you, like once upon a time you were a curious young Grad student or something? Not more or less. In fact we, you even have to go back further. You know I'm dating myself at age 45 but the, I have to go back to my undergraduate years talking 1990 and I was at Princeton and when we were, you know you do senior thesis there and Princeton was ahead of its time and I got lots of funding and I went off to London and Kenya.

Speaker 7:          12:39          And how old are you when you're taking this trip? Oh I'm 20 so Caroline is working in Nairobi and I'm doing research at the time my senior thesis was looking at the Kikuyu, which is the largest ethnic group in Kenya. And I was looking primarily at the shifting roles of women and the ways in which they were impacted by colonialism. So Caroline, it was wake up every morning and would walk to this old colonial building right in Nairobi city center called the National Archives. It's loud, it's dusty. It's, um, you know, sometimes you had to jump under the desk for several hours cause there was a shootout across the street and really? Yeah. Wow. Yeah, that was quite a Saturday. Um, long story short, so one day she was at the archives flipping through some files when I came across some files on, uh, detention camp

Speaker 7:          13:32          [inaudible] detention camp [inaudible] commit to you saying come meet t k a m as in Mary, I t I and this was a Nairobi just outside. And I remember okay. And I said, Gosh, you know, I know nothing about this. So she calls over the archivist guy named Evanson and I said, ever see? Got Anything else like this? He said, yeah, let me take a walk. And then Evanson starts bringing me some other files also related to committee, very bureaucratic files. These pages were filled with the, the details, numbers of prisoners. A lot of them were women, well over a thousand because they would mention a hundred of this and a couple hundred of that. And at that point I thought, what's going on? So short time later she gets back to Princeton and being the good little undergraduate history major that I was, I just, I searched high and low about detention camps in Kenya. Nothing much, no mention of this center any, there's nobody who had done a systematic study of it. Okay. And that's what I was at. So without anything else to go on, Caroline just started driving up country as they say, in the middle of nowhere. Kenya, all these tiny little villages in the central province. I mean really if you wanted to find middle of nowhere on the map I was in it, I would just show up at somebody who's a little Shambo or farm one day and [inaudible].

Speaker 6:          14:54          Next thing you know, I'm conducting an interview. Can you ask her while working about how many Hailey? No, these are tapes. She recorded on a few of her trips. She would speak to people through her research assistant, Terry Wirey Mu. I mean, some of these interviews go on for hours than one interview begets the next. Every time you finish an interview you say, you know, do you have somebody else who I could talk to? [inaudible] they say, Oh yeah, I've got my friend lives three bridges up in four hills over. So she would talk to that person. [inaudible] and then the person they referred to [inaudible] and then person they refer to to move in. Like this is what she did for like five years. I went and interviewed several hundred villagers. And what exactly are they telling you? Um, stories you can't imagine

Speaker 10:         15:44          [inaudible]

Speaker 11:         15:47          what the stories were, what those stories have begun to unravel is up next.

Speaker 12:         15:57          [inaudible] maybe do that. What you mean? [inaudible] [inaudible] [inaudible] hello [inaudible] good. [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          17:56          Hey, I'm Jeff. I'm Ron and I'm Robert Krulwich Radiolab. Before we get to the stories that Caroline was referring to, um, we should say that as we were sort of reporting this story, we really kind of fell in deep, uh, to the point where Jamie York, who had already gone to London to get hassled by those guards at Hansel Park, he then decided to spend part of his vacation

Speaker 2:          18:17          in Kenya, basically following in Carolina Elkins footsteps. Yes. And that's when he stumbled into something kind of surprising. So it got picked up early one morning in Nairobi and driven about three hours into the countryside and okay, after what felt like five right? Turns 37 lefts. We finally wind up in this completely rural place. It really does feel like the middle of the nowhere. It's like a little village or something. Yup. Little cluster of houses and rolling hills in a county called knee area. Okay. Got My stuff. Got Out of the car, followed Terry who uh, had arranged the trip. My name is [inaudible]. I am 41 years old. This is the same Terry who translated for Carolyn Elkins many years. Anyhow, best a few kids and Terry walks me into this little clay hut. There's a table in the center of the room, there's a handful of plastic chairs around it and eventually people start showing up. I'm good. Here I am with women. You are gay. Nine women who are all in their late eighties early nineties.

Speaker 2:          19:32          I'm like [inaudible] making reductions and honestly I'm a little bit disappointed because the Malmo, I thought we're just men, Jimmy fighters and seeing these women. I thought, I don't know. I realized most of the men have died of old age. Oh, so you thought you were going to meet anybody. Exactly. How you curious for myself, but I thought, okay, I'll just, I'll just ask how many of them are women? Like show of hands, how many of you would identify as Malmo at today about to give will be instantaneously put their hand up. All nine people. Yeah. And then started to sort of chuckle if I did fun that we asking them because it's obvious to us are putting Mama. They were like, of course we were supporting the Mama. We were, the was like that. That was everybody.

Speaker 1:          20:22          Oh, interesting. So it wasn't just like a small band of militants. It wasn't a small band in militants amongst the cuckoo you, it was almost everyone. This is one of the first things that caught Carolina Elkins attention made her really questioned that official narrative. Cause when she was doing interviews 15 years ago, she says everyone, she spoke to every one to a person and we're talking hundreds of interviews started with, I took the oath on such and such a date.

Speaker 3:          20:48          Very interesting.

Speaker 1:          20:49          Seem to her. What you had here was not a small insurrection. This was a mass movement and she would discover that the British responds to, it was also massive. 1953 shortly after the murder of the ruck family, the white settlers marched, demanded that the colonial government do something, and so what happened is that the colonial soldiers, they came to the village, they started going to villages across Kenya. They rounded everybody up, no joke, slaughtered their cattle, slaughter their goats, burned down their homesteads and put them into these prison villages, some 800 barbwire villages throughout central province, Kenya, [inaudible]. The village was like a concentration camp.

Speaker 9:          21:36          The thing, the thing to grasp here is that this is very carefully designed and very practical.

Speaker 1:          21:42          David says there was a very carefully planned system at work. The barbwire villages were primarily for women and children. Men were usually sent to these detention camps, which are basically prisons. Now. The logic of those camps was actually thought up by a group of British academics who met in 1953 it's sort of an emergency meeting to discuss the quote Mal mal problem and they decided at that meeting that clearly the real reason the Malmo are rebelling

Speaker 9:          22:08          was that they were captured by some kind of mental illness.

Speaker 1:          22:12          Had nothing to do with the fact that their land had been taken away from them. No, it was set. They were temporarily crazy and the committee decided it must have something to do with those. Oh,

Speaker 9:          22:21          oh. So was seen by the British as a primitive way of capturing a cocoon mind and making the person unreasonable and insensible. The only way they argued you can get rid of the oath was to convert the person back to sanity. Part of that involved a confession of what they'd done. Once confessions were made, they would then be rewarded by a better prison regime. Then we moved into another compound given privileges, give them better food. You moved along the system, they called it a pipeline. You would along the pipeline until you were released,

Speaker 3:          22:55          but you first had to confess to a, to a confess to confers. This is good to walk Hungarian freedom fighter. I joined as the Momo freedom struggle when I was 17 years of age. He quickly became an organizer, recruiter and therefore a target. They had to uh, such for me and they caught me. They put me into a detention camp. They want us to say loudly that was for sick, the mouse struggle but refused. We refused.

Speaker 1:          23:37          In fact, one man told us the story of how in one of the barbwire villages, every once in awhile [inaudible] would come to the edge of the forest, just outside the villages fence. These were the fighters that hadn't been captured yet. They'd come right to the edge of the camp where a lot of the children would be playing. And because the no [inaudible] does that, anything about what was happening in their country, [inaudible] people in the village used to use the children to take messages to the people in the foot, the fighters in the forest. That's how they pass food and information to the fighters. And in a way kept things going. The point is, according to David, that inside the camps you had massive resistance and so in many cases the British colonial soldiers would double down. Morning the following is pretty graphic. Um, there's a BBC documentary called white terror that has tons of these frighteningly common stories of abuse from detainees.

Speaker 15:         24:36          He told me how naked tied by his feet to the bars. He was brutally beaten on the testicles with a stick.

Speaker 1:          24:42          One of them is a man giving a tour of the prison cell. He was kept in [inaudible].

Speaker 15:         24:46          Then they said his eyes with hot coals. They kept him there for eight days.

Speaker 1:          24:52          There's another story of these three men who were made to strip naked.

Speaker 16:         24:56          Well, one of the men who was made to put his head into a bucket of water with the [inaudible]. Then the white officer held one of the prisoners legs aloft and when you're smiling, God held the other Eh [inaudible] and another God brought some sand. So they started to push into the detainees anus with the stake [inaudible] [inaudible] they kept on doing this or trinity putting in sand and water. All the while pushing the mixture in with the stack. [inaudible] [inaudible] two gives me nightmares to this day because that was something that should never be done to a human being. What

Speaker 1:          25:39          in that period of coercive violence, it lasted throughout the 1950s

Speaker 6:          25:48          now the the moment we're bad guys, listen, there's nothing to excuse this kind of terrorism, but the Kenyan campaign was a sledgehammer used to crack and not

Speaker 17:         26:00          [inaudible].

Speaker 6:          26:01          There've been a lot of different estimates to try to pin down the scale of the British campaign. They range from 160,000 people killed, maim, torture, detained to much, much higher numbers. Caroline outcomes did her own calculations and according to her, by the time it was done, nearly the entire Kikuyu population of a million and a half people were detained, tortured, murdered, systematize force labor. And you have to look at scale and if you are the balance sheet of this is how many Europeans died? 30 to 32 huh? Like, why isn't this a tale that everybody in the world knows in the event, say

Speaker 7:          26:44          of the enslavement of the Hebrew people under the Pharaoh, they were slaves in Egypt. The Pharaoh wouldn't let them out. Moses had to cross the river. It becomes the national story of the Hebrew people. In this situation, you have Jomo Kenyatta who I believe is a cocoon. You becoming the first president. Why wouldn't he make this the national story? Well, Kenyatta comes out of detention and one of the first things he does is he denounces Malmo as being hooligans. The same organization that accelerated independence in Kenya. She says the same movement that scared the British [inaudible] scared him. No, he didn't want them suddenly organizing and taking his power. So for decades from 1948 until 2002 the ban on Malmo that had been put in place by the British corneal government remained in place, meaning it was illegal to even talk about it

Speaker 4:          27:42          [inaudible].

Speaker 1:          27:42          But eventually in 2005 Caroline publishes her book imperial reckoning, which included the hundreds of interviews and painted a picture of just a systemic violence. The book was well received, but she says a lot of critics told her nice story, but

Speaker 7:          28:00          no, this is an act of fiction, an act of fiction. I made it up, but you had all these interviews, right, but one of the lines of critique was that it's all based upon oral testimony. Oral testimonies aren't usable. There is no story here. She says a lot of that was just blatant racism. You know, Africans make up stories, but buried in there

Speaker 1:          28:21          is sort of a legitimate concern. I mean memory is faulty. We know that oral histories are notoriously unreliable. If you're going to rewrite an entire history, you need to get beyond personal anecdote. You need documents. Let illustrate and prove it beyond doubt. And as we mentioned, besides those few that you found, the documents didn't seem to exist.

Speaker 1:          28:44          Nonetheless. Fast forward 2009 that book, Caroline's imperial reckoning became the basis of a very large lawsuit. These Kenyan independent veterans have in June of 2009 five mammo veterans representing over 5,000 mile mouth flew to London. The seat of an empire they say is responsible for torturing them and filed a lawsuit against the British government the first time the British government had ever been sued by a former colonized population. [inaudible] veterans want an apology and some form of recompense for what happened. Are you at all nervous going into the court? I think the word nervous is not the word I would have used. I tell my partners to write off the case. I was not at all convinced that we're going to go anywhere but down, but that's smart day. He represented the Malmo veterans in court and the reason he was so sure that the case was going to go down in flames was, well, same issue. You just didn't have the documents. All he had were stories that weren't exactly rock solid. The eight was a nightmare. Old Kenyans, their late seventies

Speaker 3:          29:42          and eighties first of all, most Africans in my experience find dates extremely difficult, but people in their seventies and eighties almost impossible, and this was actually a huge problem because in the British system, if you're going to bring forward an old case like one that's more than six years old, the key question to the judge is, can you still get a fair trial? And the government can plausibly argue, no, too much time has passed. We were really worried that the judge would say, well look, there can't be a fair trial because actually these witnesses are so old, so up and down, just in terms of their memories that really their evidence is worth a great deal. So to recap, I wasn't really optimistic, but then it's kind of a last ditch effort. He contacted historian David Anderson, two dozen expert witness because David had written a book about African history that was chocked full of legal documents and they approached me to ask whether there was material in the legal cases I dealt with that might be useful.

Speaker 3:          30:38          And that's when he told them something that would ultimately lead all of us back to that scary building of secrets. He told them for the past 20 years. He has had this hunch, well so long before the mammo trial came to court, I and a number of other historians believed that documents had been brought back from Kenya to Britain. David says in that same Nairobi archive were Caroline Elkins had found the document about detention and thought, gosh, you know what's going on in that same place. Somebody else had found another document that had also fallen through the cracks. This one was a simple packing slip listing of documents for transportation. I don't know if they're packing up and removal as for where those documents were moved to. Well, no one knew. No. Maybe to an incinerator or bottom of the ocean bumped from 1990790890 nine like a starving man with a single Pringle. David kept on. I eventually bought documents from the National Archives in Britain that confirmed the stuff from Kenya actually landed in an airport in Britain on the eve of independence. I then was able to find out who took them, which van they went in, even got the college registration number, but that's when the trail went cold. They filed document requests after document requests and we get nowhere. Then something totally unexpected happens to historians working on southern Africa actually got access to Hounslow park. They got inside.

Speaker 3:          32:07          One of them was a former colonial administrator, so he could work some connections to get its way in any out. Afterwards he sends David Anderson a text message telling me the enhanced loop park keeps seeing miles and miles of shelving of documents from other colonies, including Kenya. Was that a figure of speech miles or was that a, I think he meant it literally. So He'd seen a vast a hangar as he described it with row upon row upon row of document. So when Martin Day, the lawyer David Anderson

Speaker 1:          32:40          and asked him, can you help us with it? Our case, David said, here's what I can do. I can't actually give you any documents because I don't have any, but I can outline for you the documents that I think might be out there.

Speaker 3:          32:51          The documents. I believed the British government were hiding away,

Speaker 1:          32:55          so he wrote a witness report for the judge summarizing everything he knew,

Speaker 3:          32:58          giving all the details I had, I didn't mention Huntsville Park. I didn't say what I thought they were. I just said I knew they'd come into Britain and I want you to know what happened to them. The judge read that report and then basically ask the government, do you have them or not? Look, if you can't answer this question, you'll be held in contempt of court. You'll be in another, which I will interpret this as you're withholding information and that basically means you lose the case.

Speaker 14:         33:23          No,

Speaker 9:          33:23          that decision was the turning point

Speaker 18:         33:26          half a century on from Britain's withdrawal from Kenya documents detailing the alleged brutality employed by the British colonial authorities have finally been released and suddenly having spent years denying these documents existed within four days, they found Kenyans were waiting in my ruby today for the news from London.

Speaker 1:          33:46          What are you going to see the reaction of these people here? Take one important battle here today. I mean, we're talking, we're talking something like 300 boxes of files, you know, tons of missing documents, 15,000 papers relevant to the case. This again is Katie Engelhart of vice new. She reported on the trial and the extensive number of files that the government produced a hundred linear feet. I think those, those files held, um, and they contained really, really damning evidence of Britain's conduct in Kenya. The files made it clear that the central government in London did know what was happening in Kenya. There was specific documentation of rounding up of Malmo fighters. It was even a memo about a Kenyon being roasted alive. And there was this pleading letter written by detainees up in smuggled out of a camp and it said, hurry, hurry, hurry. In order to save our souls. I mean, absolutely damning evidence. The government ultimately agreed to pay about 20 million pounds to the people who brought this lawsuit, which works out to roughly $4,600 each. Yes. Here's what I don't understand. Why would they even save those documents? Well

Speaker 9:          34:52          looking through the collections that have now emerged, it's quite clear to me that they wanted to save documents that showed that not all the European stuff in Kenya had been happy about compulsive force.

Speaker 1:          35:08          There's a letter written in 1953 by the colonies attorney general. He observed that detention facilities in Kenya or quote distressingly reminiscent of conditions in Nazi Germany or communist Russia. Oh, interesting. So you think the people, some of the British officers in Kenya Save the files precisely because they were damning.

Speaker 9:          35:28          Yes. They save stuff that would demonstrate that we didn't like this

Speaker 14:         35:35          [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          35:36          whatever the reason. Here's why the memo cases become so much bigger than just the Mal mal case. As soon as journalists and historians learned about the existence of those files, they started to relentlessly poke and request more documents and soon those 1500 very soon, that became 8,800 files and then 20,000 files and then 1.2 million files and at the time the estimate was that the files occupied about 15 miles a Florida ceiling shelving, what, 15 miles

Speaker 9:          36:06          the [inaudible] has been invoked by the mammo case. Is going to have even wider repercussions than people yet realize.

Speaker 1:          36:17          We got a little arrived in, in just a little laughed of them when we were talking with a woman named Mandy Banton, a senior research fellow at London University. She used to work at the National Archives in London and we called her just to help us parse all this stuff. And at one point I asked her, is this just the Kenya thing? And she said, oh, no, no, no, it's not. It's not by any means. Um, and she explained that after the Mamao case, the Foreign Commonwealth Office, which is the technical name for the place, it was holding those documents almost immediately afterwards. It admitted that he actually had, um, documents from 37 former colonies. Oh yes, exactly. You mean that there could be dirty stuff from Malaysia, dirty stuff from Palestine, dirty stuff from Cypress? I believe the [inaudible] sort of trouble spots if you like. I mean, this is like a rewriting of history essentially is what you said, ray writing of history.

Speaker 1:          37:11          And I mean there are now quite a lot of people. I'm looking at these, you know, comparatively newly released records now, both David and Katie o cautioned us that the new stuff when it comes out might not be quite as regulatory as all those mammo files. Well, I think there are nuggets. I think there are nuggets and I think, I mean I think historians will find them for David Anderson, one of those nuggets might be the documents about the Cold War. Those could be historically really very, very important for Caroline Elkins, Israel and Palestine. Then Malaya in Singapore and I want to know is in those Hong Kong files, there's over 250,000 documents on Hong Kong, just Hong Kong, which sort of brings us to the situation that we are in now.

Speaker 9:          37:57          Just the most ridiculous, ridiculous, stupid situation imaginable,

Speaker 1:          38:02          which is that for the moment the British government's policy is that all [inaudible] documents must be reviewed and redacted before release. So each file needs to be looked over by what's called a senior sensitivity reviewer, although colloquially it's just weeders. It's basically retired senior diplomats. If you can imagine you've got 15 miles of papers and you've got literally a couple of dozen retired diplomats and they sit in an office, literally turning pages, trying to stay awake, sitting here. Just imagine like take little sip tea and redact all day long sip, redact, sip deck and at the rate that we're going, by the time these files finally see the light of day, it will not be within my lifetime. I mean it could literally be hundreds of years. I,

Speaker 3:          38:52          I keep thinking about these two groups of elderly folks. Again, producer, Jamie York, the litigants and the Mama case are in their eighties and nineties. It just strikes me that what a crazy lucky break for them. That in the very final years they're alive. They survive. To hear this apology from the British government and acknowledgement of the story that had been telling for 50 years. Well, I find speculating there's going to be so lucky. Yeah. Thank you for putting it that way because I am having got to know the plaintiffs in the case. When they came to London, it was very clear to me that, um, what mattered to these people was not a financial settlement at all, but rather acknowledgement,

Speaker 9:          39:39          just simple acknowledgment that these things had been done to them. So on the day that the barrister for the crown stood up in court and to all of our astonishment shed, quite simply, the British government admits the tortures. Once I gathered my wix and looked around and behind me in the court, two of the plaintiffs were in tears and it brought home to me what a traumatic, appalling experience this had been for them from start to finish. So yes, I agree for them to get that triumph was remarkable, remarkable.

Speaker 4:          40:47          [inaudible]

Speaker 2:          40:47          but since our producer, Jamie York, it was really remarkable only for some people. Yes. So w when I went to Kenya and I was talking to these people who had lived through the emergency, I wanted to know about what they thought of the settlement [inaudible] [inaudible] and a lot of them were like, what settlement thing? The, they had a little mass about the government of Britain having a green [inaudible]. Some of them had heard about it. Some of them hadn't. But it doesn't really matter to them because the people that got paid, that's just a tiny sliver of the vast majority of people who've suffered. Who are you doing? [inaudible] what this one guy told me is that he and most

Speaker 1:          41:34          people, what they, what they want need isn't so much an acknowledgement. It's, it's to get back what was taken from them. [inaudible] pieces of land. Oh please. We one can keep some good cows. [inaudible] so the Deacon do with any 80 90 year old wants to do, leave something behind Eh [inaudible] to give their children and black children a better life.

Speaker 4:          42:29          [inaudible] [inaudible] [inaudible]
