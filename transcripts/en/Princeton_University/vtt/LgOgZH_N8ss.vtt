00:00:06.070 --> 00:00:08.660
JAMES STEWARD: Princeton
began building a campus art

00:00:08.660 --> 00:00:11.330
collection decades ago.


00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:17.440
As both a manifestation of
its commitment to modern art--

00:00:17.440 --> 00:00:19.610
this came about largely
through the so-called Putnam

00:00:19.610 --> 00:00:22.390
Collection, that was
committed to collecting works

00:00:22.390 --> 00:00:25.070
by the so-called
modern masters--

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:28.300
and as a way of putting art
in the path of everyday life

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:29.380
all across campus.


00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:32.070
And seeing it as a way of
enriching the campus experience

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:33.640
writ large.


00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:37.260
We already have in the
Putnam Collection, one work

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:39.180
by Alexander Calder.


00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:41.470
And this gives us an
opportunity, and a way,

00:00:41.470 --> 00:00:44.160
to think of this as a
campus-wide exhibition

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:47.470
of highlights of
Calder's output.

00:00:47.470 --> 00:00:49.320
Right now, in front
of the museum,

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:52.450
we have two Calders
on loan to us

00:00:52.450 --> 00:00:55.210
from the Fisher
Family Collection.

00:00:55.210 --> 00:00:56.990
What I think is
especially arresting

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:59.990
about Calder's production,
is that he worked primarily

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:02.440
in two idioms.


00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:05.410
He's the inventor of what were
called the mobiles and then

00:01:05.410 --> 00:01:06.740
the so-called stabiles.


00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:09.390
In both cases they're
important for the fact

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:11.240
that he was one of
the real innovators

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:13.000
in the move towards
pure abstraction.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.480
Leaving aside any
notion of representation

00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:18.000
in the form of the sculpture.


00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:22.880
I think in the case of both Man,
and The Kite That Never Flew,

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:25.140
it's tempting to see them
in their relationship

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:27.790
to each other in a somewhat
anthropomorphic way.

00:01:27.790 --> 00:01:32.480
Almost at times make me think
of ancient animals stalking

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:35.710
one another across the Plaza
in front of the museum,

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:38.800
because of the way he uses
the folded metal form.

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:42.840
They are both purely abstract
and yet resonant of something

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:46.700
that is almost kind of
subconscious or subliminal.

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:48.830
Abstract art can
liberate us in a sense

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:52.140
because we can bring our own
thoughts and issues to it.

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:56.710
It doesn't overtly tell us
a clear narrative in the way

00:01:56.710 --> 00:01:58.980
that representational
art would be.

00:01:58.980 --> 00:02:01.760
That's of course exactly what
some people find so difficult

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:02.820
about abstraction.


00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:04.810
Because they are
curious, they're

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:08.700
troubled by the lack of
clarity about meaning.

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:10.910
That is I think,
it's very power.

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:16.010
And my message to visitors
would be to feel empowered.

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:18.010
To let their minds run.


00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:19.620
To say, what might this mean?


00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:22.820
How can I develop a relationship
with this sculpture?

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:24.530
I think one of the
great values of having

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:27.330
that sculpture in the
landscape, for a time,

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:29.800
is that one can have repeat
experiences of it, including

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:30.680
accidental ones.


00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:32.760
When you simply are
walking past the Museum

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:35.460
along the [INAUDIBLE]
walk and discover these

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:38.330
under different light conditions
and different weather.

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:41.170
To experience them when
it was actively snowing,

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:44.420
was a wholly different
experience of those sculptures.

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:46.560
When someone put it
to me, they appeared

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:48.300
to be dancing in
the falling snow

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:50.540
and it was remarkably true.


00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:52.480
They were animated
in a different way

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:54.470
than they would be on
a bright sunny day.

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:56.140
And I think that's
again a part of where

00:02:56.140 --> 00:03:00.690
the richness of experience of
abstract art can come from.
