00:00:10.815 --> 00:00:13.865
Have you ever achieved something that you felt as though you didn't really deserve?

00:00:13.865 --> 00:00:17.075
Like being voted MVP on your sports team,

00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:19.500
or winning an award for an artist I made you did.

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:22.460
Or even something as simple as getting a good grade.

00:00:22.555 --> 00:00:25.465
In the moment, you are ecstatic and overjoyed,

00:00:25.535 --> 00:00:27.655
but as time went on you began to think.

00:00:27.655 --> 00:00:29.485
"Did I really deserve this?"

00:00:29.705 --> 00:00:32.135
You become suspicious of everything,

00:00:32.135 --> 00:00:35.155
thinking maybe it was a joke and you're the only one that's missing out on it.

00:00:35.235 --> 00:00:38.115
Or you become so paranoid that you hide behind a mask,

00:00:38.115 --> 00:00:41.255
in fear of someone realizing that you were indeed a fraud?

00:00:41.535 --> 00:00:44.795
If so, this is a common phenomenon known as the Impostor Effect,

00:00:44.795 --> 00:00:47.355
and that you're not alone in this feeling.

00:00:47.665 --> 00:00:50.515
Far too many of us have similar experiences to this,

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:55.620
whether at school, at work, on the field, in the orchestra, etc.

00:00:56.120 --> 00:00:59.060
We're here to let you know this phenomenon,

00:00:59.065 --> 00:01:01.745
so that you may be able to recognize it, and overlook it in the future.

00:01:02.755 --> 00:01:04.325
In 1978,

00:01:04.325 --> 00:01:07.355
two psychologists, Suzanne Imes, PhD

00:01:07.355 --> 00:01:09.895
and Pauline Rose Clance, PhD

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:12.120
observed this trait among high-achieving women,

00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:14.275
who questioned their intelligence,

00:01:14.275 --> 00:01:16.075
and thus were unable to accept their success.

00:01:16.475 --> 00:01:18.425
According to Clance and Imes,

00:01:18.425 --> 00:01:21.615
there are four behaviors that start the snowball effect of the Impostor Syndrome.

00:01:21.615 --> 00:01:25.015
Preventing belief in one's own abilities and accomplishments.

00:01:25.465 --> 00:01:28.925
One. The first behavior involves diligence and hard work.

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:32.375
Although these are common traits of any persevering individual,

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:35.200
the person suffering from the Impostor Syndrome

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:38.380
works tirelessly out of fear that they would be discovered as a fraud.

00:01:38.525 --> 00:01:41.485
So they try to catch up to the intellect they think people view them as,

00:01:41.485 --> 00:01:43.080
never getting there.

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:47.280
Thus, a vicious cycle begins with fear of being discovered as a faker,

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:48.775
leads to overworking,

00:01:48.775 --> 00:01:51.805
and hard work leading to temporary approval from superiors,

00:01:51.805 --> 00:01:53.980
which the person is subject to not believe.

00:01:53.980 --> 00:01:55.880
And it repeats all over again.

00:01:57.160 --> 00:01:58.200
Two.

00:01:58.300 --> 00:02:01.700
The second behavior focuses on having a sense of phoniness.

00:02:01.705 --> 00:02:04.335
This is whats meant by saying they wear a mask.

00:02:04.335 --> 00:02:07.025
They don't talk about their true feelings or ideas,

00:02:07.025 --> 00:02:10.800
rather saying what they believe their superiors or classmates want to hear,

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:12.395
or expect them to say.

00:02:12.395 --> 00:02:14.745
The person who is suffering from the syndrome

00:02:14.745 --> 00:02:17.995
will support another person's ideas, and downplay their own abilities.

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:21.280
This allows the impostor to believe that no one can critique them,

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:22.120
or dislike them,

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:24.420
because they're so supportive and agreeable.

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:27.020
Three. The third behavior involves

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:30.875
using charm and perceptiveness to gain favor of their superiors.

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:33.635
The impostor wants to be recognized by their professors

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:35.685
or coaches as a star pupil.

00:02:35.685 --> 00:02:39.100
So they tie that mask on tighter and try to win over their hearts.

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:41.995
This person wants to gain the support and reassureance

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.080
of their abilities from the superior,

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:47.060
in hopes that it will help her gain her confidence in her own abilities

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:48.260
beneath the mask.

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:52.000
Unfortunately, after the impostor recieves their validation,

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.040
she may begin to question her abilities,

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:57.880
thinking the validation was given because of her charm and good acting skills,

00:02:58.000 --> 00:02:59.420
and not her intellect.

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:03.040
Thus, a vicious cycle of seeking reassurance from different superiors

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:05.500
leaves the impostor unsure of her own abilities

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:06.460
and talents.

00:03:07.585 --> 00:03:10.435
Four. The fourth behavior is the impostor

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:12.280
avoiding to display confidence.

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:14.600
Modesty is the best policy

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:16.900
is a true ________ for an impostor.

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:20.340
If the person suffering from the syndrome avoids showing confidence,

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:23.400
no one can challenge them on their intellect or ideas,

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:26.180
because they never go out of their way to announce them.

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:29.940
Avoiding conflict and confrontation is key in this situation,

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:32.075
because the impostor fears that if they

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:34.715
show any bit of confidence in their ideas or abilities,

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:36.280
her peers will fight her on them,

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:38.480
and shun her for her ignorance.

00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:40.900
After all this, do you feel like you

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:43.240
relate to the traits of the impostor in question?

00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:46.280
If so, then you've experienced the Impostor Syndrome as well.

00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:49.175
You might be wondering this pressing question,

00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:50.460
"Can this be treated?"

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:52.720
Thankfully, the answer is yes.

00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:55.840
According to Clance and Imes, a “multi-modal therapy

00:03:55.840 --> 00:03:58.880
in which several therapeutic approaches are used concurrently

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:02.280
seems most effective in altering the impostor belief in a client.”

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:05.180
as well as “a group therapy setting or an inter-actional group

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:07.200
in which there are some other high achieving women

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:10.560
experiencing the impostor phenomenon is highly recommended.”

00:04:10.855 --> 00:04:13.475
The group setting is extremely valuable because

00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:15.660
one, women feel more secure when they realize

00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:18.700
that they are not alone in dealing with the impostor phenomenon,

00:04:18.700 --> 00:04:19.920
and two,

00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:22.735
women have a chance to reflect when they her another woman’s story

00:04:22.735 --> 00:04:25.235
and the lack of reality in their rationale.

00:04:25.825 --> 00:04:28.355
This can even be broken down in this video.

00:04:28.355 --> 00:04:30.685
From watching this and hearing about the effect,

00:04:30.685 --> 00:04:32.220
and relating it to yourself,

00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:35.240
you begin to realize that you are not alone in these feelings,

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:38.155
and others around you experience the same thoughts.

00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:39.660
By recognizing this impostor

00:04:39.660 --> 00:04:41.555
as feelings, and pushing them aside,

00:04:41.555 --> 00:04:44.865
you can no longer be afraid of being exposed as a fake.

00:04:44.865 --> 00:04:47.045
You can be confident that you're not one.

00:04:48.215 --> 00:04:50.575
