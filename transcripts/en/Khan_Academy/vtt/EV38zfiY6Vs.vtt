00:00:00.331 --> 00:00:02.142
- Try to pause the video and figure out

00:00:02.142 --> 00:00:06.645
what 71 plus 24 is.

00:00:06.646 --> 00:00:08.968
All right, now let's do this together.

00:00:08.968 --> 00:00:13.216
So let's think about what 71 actually means.

00:00:13.217 --> 00:00:15.795
Well we have a one in the ones place.

00:00:15.795 --> 00:00:17.188
Let me make this clear.

00:00:17.188 --> 00:00:21.413
So this is the ones place and we have one one.

00:00:21.414 --> 00:00:23.921
So that's that one one right over there.

00:00:23.921 --> 00:00:27.544
And then the tens place - in the tens place

00:00:27.544 --> 00:00:30.887
we have seven so we have seven groups of ten.

00:00:30.887 --> 00:00:36.506
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven groups of ten.

00:00:36.506 --> 00:00:41.289
So this really means seven tens and one one.

00:00:41.289 --> 00:00:44.888
This right over here, 71 boxes.

00:00:44.888 --> 00:00:48.370
Now we're going to add to that two tens.

00:00:48.371 --> 00:00:50.716
We're gonna add to that two tens;

00:00:50.716 --> 00:00:51.854
you see them here.

00:00:51.854 --> 00:00:55.848
One ten, two tens and four ones.

00:00:55.848 --> 00:00:57.984
And four ones.

00:00:57.984 --> 00:00:59.934
So what is that going to be?

00:00:59.934 --> 00:01:04.206
Well lets first thing about the ones.

00:01:04.206 --> 00:01:06.900
We have one one and four more ones.

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:09.268
Well that's going to be five ones.

00:01:09.268 --> 00:01:11.381
That's going to be five ones,

00:01:11.381 --> 00:01:12.937
so we can count them right over there.

00:01:12.937 --> 00:01:14.980
This is five ones right over there.

00:01:14.980 --> 00:01:18.625
One one plus four ones is five ones.

00:01:18.625 --> 00:01:19.972
And then when you look at the tens;

00:01:19.972 --> 00:01:22.782
seven tens plus two tens.

00:01:22.782 --> 00:01:25.289
Well if you combine all of these together -

00:01:25.289 --> 00:01:27.936
if you combine all of these together you

00:01:27.936 --> 00:01:30.867
are going to have nine of these groups of ten.

00:01:30.867 --> 00:01:32.980
We're gonna have nine tens.

00:01:32.980 --> 00:01:36.811
Seven tens plus two tens is nine tens.

00:01:36.811 --> 00:01:38.832
So we're left with nine tens which

00:01:38.832 --> 00:01:42.291
we see right over here and five ones.

00:01:42.291 --> 00:01:44.288
And five ones.

00:01:44.288 --> 00:01:46.308
Well what's another way of saying nine tens

00:01:46.308 --> 00:01:47.771
and five ones?

00:01:47.771 --> 00:01:52.830
Well that's 95, and we're done.
