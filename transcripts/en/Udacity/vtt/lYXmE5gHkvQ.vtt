00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:05.630
The anomaly detection approach involves
first developing a model of normal or

00:00:05.630 --> 00:00:08.400
legitimate behaviors by collecting

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:13.260
data from the normal operations of
the monitored system and network.

00:00:13.260 --> 00:00:15.420
This is called a training phase.

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:19.600
Once this model exists,
the observed behavior is compared

00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:23.867
with this model in order to
classify it as either legitimate or

00:00:23.867 --> 00:00:27.550
anomalous and
this is the detection phase.

00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:32.590
A variety of approaches are used to
construct such depression model.

00:00:32.590 --> 00:00:39.310
The statistical approach, process
data into metrics or measures and

00:00:39.310 --> 00:00:45.178
then apply univariate, multivariate or
time series analysis to view a model.

00:00:45.178 --> 00:00:49.858
The knowledge based approach
uses expert knowledge to encode

00:00:49.858 --> 00:00:55.190
legitimate behavior into a set
of rules as the detection model.

00:00:55.190 --> 00:00:59.775
A machine learning approach uses data
mining and machine learning techniques

00:00:59.775 --> 00:01:03.050
to automatically learn a model
from the training data.

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:06.290
When we compare these approaches,

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:10.570
we need to consider both efficiency and
cost.

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:15.330
Efficiency here means how fast we can
learning a model from training data, and

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:17.750
how fast we can apply the model

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:22.210
to the observed data to determine
whether it is anomalous or normal.

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:27.670
The cost of detection here means, how
much data do we need in order to view

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:33.740
the model and apply the model, and how
much completion of power it is required?

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:34.670
For example,

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:38.420
typically a machine learning based
approach required a lot of data.
