00:00:00.860 --> 00:00:04.370
Write the conditional
statement in if-then form.

00:00:04.370 --> 00:00:06.920
And the statement is,
dogs have four legs, which

00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:07.800
we know is true.

00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:09.300
So another way of
thinking about it,

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:13.860
you say, well, if you have a dog
or if an animal is a dog then

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:15.280
it's going to have four legs.

00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:16.820
That's an equivalent
statement to this here.

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:19.070
So let's see if we can
construct a sentence like that.

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:31.270
So if an animal is a dog
then it has four legs.

00:00:31.270 --> 00:00:33.140
So that was pretty
straightforward.

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:35.510
Let's do a few more of these.

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:36.480
So here, same thing.

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:38.250
We want to write this
as in if-then form,

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:43.080
I will win a gold medal
when I go to the Olympics.

00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:43.760
So let's see.

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:46.490
This is essentially saying,
if I go to the Olympics

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:48.450
then I will win a gold medal.

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:59.157
So if I go to the Olympics
then I win a gold medal.

00:00:59.157 --> 00:01:00.990
Now, you might be tempted
to say, hey, well,

00:01:00.990 --> 00:01:03.640
I saw gold medal first here
then I saw Olympics later

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:05.310
in the sentence, but
this isn't saying

00:01:05.310 --> 00:01:09.340
that if you win a
gold medal then you

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:12.030
have gone to the Olympics or
then you will go the Olympics.

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:14.204
You might win a gold medal
at the local track meet

00:01:14.204 --> 00:01:15.620
or something, and
that's not going

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:17.870
to ensure that you're
going to the Olympics.

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:20.332
This is saying that if
you go the Olympics--

00:01:20.332 --> 00:01:22.040
this person is very
confident who is ever

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:24.235
saying this-- I will
win a gold medal when

00:01:24.235 --> 00:01:25.110
I go to the Olympics.

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:28.870
So that's the same
statement as saying,

00:01:28.870 --> 00:01:33.360
if I go to the Olympics, I'm
going to win a gold medal.

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:36.637
So if I go to the Olympics
then I win a gold medal.

00:01:36.637 --> 00:01:38.470
And actually, this
statement is a little bit

00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:40.220
more confident than this
one because here they say,

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:41.880
if I go to the Olympics
while here they

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:43.540
say when I go to the Olympics.

00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:45.550
But I think you get the idea.

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:47.890
Let's do a couple more of these.

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:51.160
I will go to Disneyland
when I win a gold medal.

00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:53.280
So now, winning
the gold medal is

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:55.440
what's driving stuff to happen.

00:01:55.440 --> 00:02:00.130
So if I win a gold medal
then I will go to Disneyland.

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:12.574
So if I win a gold medal
then I go to Disneyland.

00:02:12.574 --> 00:02:13.490
Oh, that wasn't right.

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:15.180
Oh, I didn't put this.

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:16.670
I go to Disneyland.

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:17.510
I got too careless.

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:20.350
I got to make sure I do
if I win a gold medal then

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:22.280
I go to Disneyland.

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:23.901
And now we got it right.

00:02:23.901 --> 00:02:24.650
Let's do one more.

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:25.774
I can't do enough of these.

00:02:25.774 --> 00:02:28.150
These are incredibly fun.

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:32.030
Isosceles triangles
have two equal sides.

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:34.300
So if I have an
isosceles triangle

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:37.224
then I have two equal sides.

00:02:37.224 --> 00:02:45.380
So if a shape is an
isosceles triangle

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:50.570
then it has two equal sides.

00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:53.020
And we got it right.
