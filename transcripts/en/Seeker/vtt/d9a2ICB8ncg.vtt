00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:04.640
In what may turn out to be one of the worst
ecological disasters in recent memory, the

00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:07.919
EPA recently “accidently” spilled millions
of gallons of waste into the Animas river

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:09.160
in Colorado.

00:00:09.160 --> 00:00:13.629
Why did it turn that freaky orange color?

00:00:13.629 --> 00:00:20.610
So, the EPA made the Animas River orange on
accident by spilling some wastewater out of

00:00:20.610 --> 00:00:21.610
a mine.

00:00:21.610 --> 00:00:24.779
I don’t know about you but I’m picturing
buffoonish guys carrying barrels of waste

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:27.730
and one of them just trips and whoops it all
falls into the river.

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:31.800
While there might have been some buffoonery,
the whole incident is a little more complicated

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:32.800
than that.

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:35.010
Like most Western Tales it all starts with
a mine.

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:37.750
The Gold King Mine near Silverton, Colorado
in fact.

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:42.400
Most of the area is littered with mines, when
in the late 1880-1920s lots of people went

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:43.850
looking for precious metals.

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:47.570
But, the thing about mining is, sooner or
later if you dig deep enough, you’ll run

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:48.570
into water.

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:52.570
If the water ends up reacting with pyrite
(or fool's gold) and oxygen it will form a

00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:55.530
pool of sulfuric acid and dissolved iron.

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:58.940
This acid isn’t good on it’s own, but
if it gets in contact with people it can cause

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:02.030
blindness, and if swallowed it can burn holes
in your insides.

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:05.330
In this case, the water dissolved other minerals
too, like lead and copper.

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:09.350
Each metal is toxic on its own, but mix them
all together and you get a nasty soup of heavy

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:10.350
metals.

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:14.260
Miners back in the day didn’t have to do
anything with it, because there was no one

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:15.260
regulating their wastewater.

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:17.830
Usually they just dumped it somewhere, like
a nearby river.

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:22.340
But in this case, a lot of it was still trapped
inside The Gold King Mine... or it was.

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:25.960
The mine changed hands multiple times over
the past few decades, and eventually fell

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:26.960
into disrepair.

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:30.850
Now, it had been leaking toxic water for a
while now -- which brings us to the EPA.

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:35.120
The EPA knew the mine contained wastewater,
and was considering designating it a superfund

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:39.740
site since the 1980s; a designation reserved
for only the worst toxic messes.

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:43.050
Remediation efforts were underway, but that’s
what caused all this trouble.

00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:45.409
You see, the EPA was trying to clean up the
site.

00:01:45.409 --> 00:01:49.170
The main goal was to install a pipe to drain
some of the water and plug the mine so that

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:51.380
all the toxic water would stay trapped inside.

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:55.690
While trying to excavate some fallen debris
in the mine, some of that debris collapsed

00:01:55.690 --> 00:01:57.860
and it all went south really quick.

00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:01.350
Toxic water started pouring into Cement Creek,
a tributary of the Animas River.

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:04.799
Turning the Animas River the color of… well
Newsweek describes it as “reminiscent of

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:06.050
boxed mac and cheese”.

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:07.050
yuuuum.

00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:10.410
One EPA official said they were surprised
that “there was quite a bit more mine wastewater

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:11.880
up there than [they] had expected.

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:13.750
They were really trying to make things better.

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:15.130
but they didn’t.

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:18.780
While initial reports estimated the spill
at a million gallons, four days later it became

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:22.660
apparent that THREE TIMES that amount was
actually spilled, releasing all those toxic

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:23.990
heavy metals into the environment.

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:28.850
The UK based Guardian reported that metals
like “cadmium, arsenic, lead, copper ,and

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:29.850
manganese”.

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:33.810
At it’s peak, the mine was gushing about
500 gallons of water a minute!

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:38.069
Most of these metals were released in an initial
“plume” where levels of lead spiked to

00:02:38.069 --> 00:02:41.420
3,500 times the normal level and arsenic,
300 times normal.

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:45.720
But according to a Colorado Parks and Wildlife
test, the water isn’t too deadly.

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:50.340
They tested the toxicity of the water by placing
cages of fish in the water for a few days.

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:53.490
They’ve only had one fatality out of hundreds
of fish.

00:02:53.490 --> 00:02:58.680
Unlike a similar test during another big spill
back in the 1970s when a huge heavy-metal-loaded

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:00.820
tailings pile spilled into the river.

00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:04.340
During that similar test with fish, nearly
all died within 24 hours.

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:08.380
So this isn’t the first or worst disaster
the river has seen, but we can hope it’ll

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:09.380
be the last.

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:13.281
Already things seem to be clearing up, the
EPA says the notoriously orange tint isn’t

00:03:13.281 --> 00:03:45.250
visible anymore, but the river remains closed
indefinitely.
