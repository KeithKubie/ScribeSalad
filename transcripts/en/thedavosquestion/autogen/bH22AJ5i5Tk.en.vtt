once described us as there are people

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:13.410
once described us as there are people

evidence and I thought that's what you
 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:21.349
evidence and I thought that's what you
should normally do but then I realized

out for anything that is evidence-based

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:28.680
out for anything that is evidence-based
 

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:32.030
out for anything that is evidence-based
and unfortunately that means to a large

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:32.040
and unfortunately that means to a large
 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:35.569

things that have in the past been able
 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:43.549
things that have in the past been able
to satisfy our needs for understanding

00:00:43.549 --> 00:00:43.559
to satisfy our needs for understanding

talking about religion I'm adding
 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:55.130

religion which is not evidence-based is

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:55.140
religion which is not evidence-based is
 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:57.740
religion which is not evidence-based is
what's holding us back in getting to

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:57.750
what's holding us back in getting to
 

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:00.290
what's holding us back in getting to
evidence-based decision area so that is

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:00.300
evidence-based decision area so that is
 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:02.000
evidence-based decision area so that is
also what I think the large part of this

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010
also what I think the large part of this
 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:05.509
also what I think the large part of this
forum is about how to move away from

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:05.519
forum is about how to move away from
 

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:08.390
forum is about how to move away from
sort of random decisions or emotional

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:08.400
sort of random decisions or emotional
 

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:10.700
sort of random decisions or emotional
decisions and trying to figure out what

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:10.710
decisions and trying to figure out what
 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:13.429
decisions and trying to figure out what
works what doesn't work and use the

00:01:13.429 --> 00:01:13.439
works what doesn't work and use the
 

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:16.820
works what doesn't work and use the
things that work so it's it's a very

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:16.830
things that work so it's it's a very
 

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:19.820
things that work so it's it's a very
positive approach I think and it's all

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:19.830
positive approach I think and it's all
 

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:22.190
positive approach I think and it's all
based on what you see it what the

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:22.200
based on what you see it what the
 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:24.260
based on what you see it what the
results are where you can go with this

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:24.270
results are where you can go with this
 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:27.560
results are where you can go with this
results it does not mean that we

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:27.570
results it does not mean that we
 

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:30.499
results it does not mean that we
shouldn't decide what we like or what we

00:01:30.499 --> 00:01:30.509
shouldn't decide what we like or what we
 

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:33.410
shouldn't decide what we like or what we
want but the means to get there should

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:33.420
want but the means to get there should
 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:36.380
want but the means to get there should
at least be based on evidence that's not

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:36.390
at least be based on evidence that's not
 

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:41.119
at least be based on evidence that's not
likely go to evidence place this is not
