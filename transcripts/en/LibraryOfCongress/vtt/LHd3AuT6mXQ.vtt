00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:03.970
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington DC.

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:26.700 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Annette McLean: Good evening,
welcome to our Founders Day Weekend.

00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:28.840
I'm Anne McLean from the
Library's Concert Office

00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:32.300
and we are very excited
to be celebrating 90 years

00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:35.540
of legendary concerts here at the
Library of Congress this season.

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:39.850
Nine decades after the
Library opened in October 1925,

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:41.150
concerts from the Library

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:43.820
of Congress is alive,
vibrant and colorful.

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:47.480
And it's exciting and exhilarating
to be celebrating our history

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:49.320
and looking forward to the future

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:53.070
with a splendid lineup
of more than 95 events.

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:56.670
This weekend we're honoring the
150th anniversary of the founder

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:00.230
of our concerts, Elizabeth Sprague
Coolidge, an extraordinary woman,

00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:04.740
extraordinary philanthropist,
and extraordinary role model.

00:01:04.740 --> 00:01:07.380
Today, October 30th,
is her birthday,

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:10.450
day that we mark each season
with a special project.

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:13.540
And I'm happy to say that two of
her great granddaughters are here

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:17.510
with us, Jose and Peg
[inaudible], so welcome to them.

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:23.930
[ Applause ]

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:26.970
Mrs. Coolidge, as many of you
know already, was a brilliant

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:29.530
and formidable woman,
pianist, composer, [inaudible]

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:33.020
and a passionate advocate
for chamber music.

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:37.570
She endowed our superb concert hall
and supervised it's construction.

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:40.300
She established our concert
series here through a concept

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:43.550
that was visionary and
radical for its time,

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:47.810
a public/private partnership, a
path breaking innovation signed

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:50.370
into law by Calvin Coolidge.

00:01:50.370 --> 00:01:53.880
And if you have our brochure
you can see a reprint image

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:56.140
of that first bill.

00:01:56.140 --> 00:01:57.530
This was a first.

00:01:57.530 --> 00:02:00.140
Her gesture was a first.

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:01.560
Her vision and her leadership

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:04.600
which has made possible
nearly 3000 concerts and more

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:07.420
than 100 significant
Coolidge Foundation commission

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:11.720
for the Library was the spark for
our panel tonight, A Leading Role:

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:14.940
A Conversation on Women
in the Music World.

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:18.810
And I wanted to say, too, that
you can see in a handsome exhibit

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:21.280
about Mrs. Coolidge
and her life and career

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:24.250
over in the James Madison
Building across the street.

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:27.580
It's beautifully put together and
curated by our two colleagues,

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:30.930
Robin Rousch [assumed
spelling] and Katelyn Miller.

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:34.730
This weekend we have concerts that
reflect Mrs. Coolidge's interests

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:38.140
in music, both very new,
tomorrow's concert --

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:41.380
or tonight's concert
by a modern master

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:43.890
and vocal magician, Meredith Monk.

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:46.140
And also music that was very old.

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:48.170
Tomorrow we have Pomerium,

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:52.690
a vocal ensemble performing
music of renaissance masters.

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:55.780
So I'd like to introduce our
distinguished panel tonight,

00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:59.900
and I'm very grateful
to these speakers.

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:03.150
We are honored to have as our
featured speaker, Jane Chu,

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:05.380
Chairman of the National
Endowment of the Arts.

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:07.510
It's [inaudible] to have you here.

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:11.700
[ Applause ]

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:14.730
Chairman Chu is the 11th
chairman of the NEA appointed

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:17.840
by President Obama in 2014.

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:21.330
In addition to awarding
nearly $220 million

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:25.480
in grants during her tenure just to
date, she's also launched a number

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:29.650
of new programs, and including
one called Creative Connections,

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:32.450
we'll hear about --
Creativity Connects, pardon me,

00:03:32.450 --> 00:03:33.980
which we'll hear about later.

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:36.800
She is a pianist and a
former concert presenter,

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:39.810
and this was of great interest
to us when she was appointed.

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:45.230
From 2006 to 2014 she was president
and CEO of the Kauffman Center

00:03:45.230 --> 00:03:47.930
for the Performing Arts
in Kansas City, Missouri,

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:52.980
overseeing a $413 million
campaign to build that center.

00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:55.540
She holds a doctorate
in Philanthropic Studies

00:03:55.540 --> 00:03:57.200
and a background in fundraising

00:03:57.200 --> 00:04:01.720
and development is an
important part of her portfolio.

00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:05.940
We are very, very pleased to be
able to work closely with the NEA

00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:09.130
and we will talk a little bit
more about the intersection

00:04:09.130 --> 00:04:13.760
between public and private funding
and developing those initiates.

00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:17.420
Cellist and educator, Astrid
Schween, is admired internationally

00:04:17.420 --> 00:04:20.580
as both a solo and chamber
artist, long-time member

00:04:20.580 --> 00:04:23.570
of the Lark Quartet, with whom she
has performed here at the Library.

00:04:23.570 --> 00:04:26.960 position:56%
She's now performing with the Boston
Trio and she's a professor of Cello

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:28.790
at the University of Massachusetts.

00:04:28.790 --> 00:04:32.730
In 2016 she will join the Julliard
String Quartet, whom I know many

00:04:32.730 --> 00:04:36.620
of you are fans of, replacing
cellist Joel Krosnick,

00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:40.520
and will join the faculty
at the Juilliard School.

00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:42.320
Margaret Lioi --

00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:47.040
[ Applause ]

00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:50.670
Margaret Lioi is CEO of Chamber
Music America, founded 28 years ago

00:04:50.670 --> 00:04:53.640
to develop, support and
strengthen the chamber music field,

00:04:53.640 --> 00:04:55.670
and I'm glad to say that the
Library has been a member

00:04:55.670 --> 00:04:59.880
since the very early days of the
founding of the organization.

00:04:59.880 --> 00:05:02.010
She too has a background
very impressive

00:05:02.010 --> 00:05:04.210
in performance and business skills.

00:05:04.210 --> 00:05:06.490
She has an MBA in Arts
Administration,

00:05:06.490 --> 00:05:08.700
and has held the post of
Director or Development

00:05:08.700 --> 00:05:12.400
for the Spoleto Festival USA,
and the Executive Director

00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:16.920
of the Eleanor Naylor
Dana Charitable Trust.

00:05:16.920 --> 00:05:20.090
And I'd like to say that CMA is
a very important commissioner

00:05:20.090 --> 00:05:24.540
of new music, offering a number
of commissions, and we will talk

00:05:24.540 --> 00:05:26.370
about commissioning a little later.

00:05:26.370 --> 00:05:30.590
We would like to get started with
hearing from these experts on many,

00:05:30.590 --> 00:05:36.310
many areas of the world of music
and business as they intersect.

00:05:36.310 --> 00:05:38.830
And we would like to start
off with Astrid Schween.

00:05:38.830 --> 00:05:40.130
&gt;&gt; Astrid Schween: Okay.

00:05:40.130 --> 00:05:41.430
Good evening.

00:05:41.430 --> 00:05:42.730
Hi, this is [inaudible].

00:05:42.730 --> 00:05:47.130
Okay. So I put together a little
narrative of what my life is

00:05:47.130 --> 00:05:50.850
like as a teacher, as a
performer, as a mentor.

00:05:50.850 --> 00:05:53.970
I found this a wonderful
exercise and a great way to kind

00:05:53.970 --> 00:05:59.280
of explore the impact I am and
perhaps am not having on people

00:05:59.280 --> 00:06:03.980
around me, so I've
prepared a little something.

00:06:03.980 --> 00:06:07.630
My perspective on women in the
music world has been shaped

00:06:07.630 --> 00:06:11.060
by my activities as a
performer, teacher and mentor.

00:06:11.060 --> 00:06:15.550
In these roles I've spent much
of my time focusing on aspects

00:06:15.550 --> 00:06:18.730
that are largely technical,
analytical,

00:06:18.730 --> 00:06:20.640
diagnostic and practical.

00:06:20.640 --> 00:06:25.140
As a teacher one of my
primary responsibilities is

00:06:25.140 --> 00:06:27.480
to address the needs
of each student,

00:06:27.480 --> 00:06:31.620 position:56%
and help balance their strengths and
weaknesses as developing cellists.

00:06:31.620 --> 00:06:34.330
Each student is different,
and the work tends to focus

00:06:34.330 --> 00:06:36.840
on individual issues
that are independent

00:06:36.840 --> 00:06:39.920
of race, gender or even age.

00:06:39.920 --> 00:06:42.440
My perspective has
also been influenced

00:06:42.440 --> 00:06:47.120
by a very diverse family life that
included a rich network of friends

00:06:47.120 --> 00:06:50.970
and family members from multiple
cultures and backgrounds.

00:06:50.970 --> 00:06:53.690
My parents even chose my schools

00:06:53.690 --> 00:06:57.320
to reflect a similarly
mixed population.

00:06:57.320 --> 00:07:00.140
There was also never
any doubt at home

00:07:00.140 --> 00:07:03.120
that I would pursue a
professional career.

00:07:03.120 --> 00:07:05.690
And it's nice to see a clip
like that from [inaudible],

00:07:05.690 --> 00:07:08.460
I can understand that motivation.

00:07:08.460 --> 00:07:11.670
I later discovered that these
values, which I took for granted,

00:07:11.670 --> 00:07:15.360
were not necessarily consistent
with some of the conventions

00:07:15.360 --> 00:07:19.500
of the times, such as those
I found during summer visits

00:07:19.500 --> 00:07:22.620
to my father's family
in post war Germany,

00:07:22.620 --> 00:07:27.090 position:56%
or even in some suburban communities
closer to home, or the attitudes

00:07:27.090 --> 00:07:30.920
of some teachers that boys,
as future breadwinners,

00:07:30.920 --> 00:07:35.200
would be more focused
attention than girls.

00:07:35.200 --> 00:07:38.480
My most direct mentorship
experience as a young cellist was

00:07:38.480 --> 00:07:41.850
with the great cellist,
Jacqueline du Pre.

00:07:41.850 --> 00:07:45.900
Through a series of lucky events
I was able to work with her

00:07:45.900 --> 00:07:49.190
and made numerous trips to London
over the course of seven years,

00:07:49.190 --> 00:07:51.380
while still a student at Juilliard.

00:07:51.380 --> 00:07:53.920
My lessons with Jacqueline
were unique.

00:07:53.920 --> 00:07:57.670
As someone who had lost the ability
to play because of her illness,

00:07:57.670 --> 00:08:01.130
she learned to communicate
the essentials by singing

00:08:01.130 --> 00:08:04.400
and making gestures with her arms.

00:08:04.400 --> 00:08:05.940
We listened to recordings

00:08:05.940 --> 00:08:09.430
and she would explain what she
had been thinking interpretively

00:08:09.430 --> 00:08:11.310
and while on stage.

00:08:11.310 --> 00:08:15.880
These musically in-depth sessions
always included at least one meal,

00:08:15.880 --> 00:08:18.360
several cups of tea,
and lots of stories

00:08:18.360 --> 00:08:21.650
about her life as a touring artist.

00:08:21.650 --> 00:08:25.870
Normally you spend one hour
with your teacher each week,

00:08:25.870 --> 00:08:31.010 position:56%
or a little more with studio class
time, but in this case I was invited

00:08:31.010 --> 00:08:33.390
into the thought process
and creative process

00:08:33.390 --> 00:08:35.740
in a way that was completely new.

00:08:35.740 --> 00:08:39.340
Jacqueline took the time to share
with me and explain from the point

00:08:39.340 --> 00:08:41.960
of view of a performer
the nuts and bolts

00:08:41.960 --> 00:08:44.210
of assembling an interpretation

00:08:44.210 --> 00:08:47.370
and rending it practically
through the instrument.

00:08:47.370 --> 00:08:51.030
To me this was the
essence of mentorship.

00:08:51.030 --> 00:08:55.530
Women in the music world, with
quotes, took on new meaning

00:08:55.530 --> 00:08:59.870
when I became of an all
women string quartet.

00:08:59.870 --> 00:09:02.640
I started traveling
extensively with the Lark Quartet

00:09:02.640 --> 00:09:05.150
for concerts, tours
and competitions.

00:09:05.150 --> 00:09:09.030
This very valuable professional
experience included both mentoring

00:09:09.030 --> 00:09:13.380
students of my own during quartet
residencies at various institutions

00:09:13.380 --> 00:09:16.460
around the country, as well
as being mentored by some

00:09:16.460 --> 00:09:19.460
of the great chamber music
artists of the generation,

00:09:19.460 --> 00:09:23.230
who worked with us as we
prepared for competitions.

00:09:23.230 --> 00:09:29.210
These included members of the
Budapest, Amadeus, Bardeen,

00:09:29.210 --> 00:09:31.990
[inaudible] Juilliard
and LaSalle quartets.

00:09:31.990 --> 00:09:34.380
With Jackie my lessons were all

00:09:34.380 --> 00:09:37.110
about how do you make
this particular sound,

00:09:37.110 --> 00:09:41.580
how do you sustain this line,
how do you play with more power,

00:09:41.580 --> 00:09:47.060 position:56%
how do you conserve your energy, how
does one imitate the human voice.

00:09:47.060 --> 00:09:50.460 position:56%
With these quartet masters it
tended to be more about illustrating

00:09:50.460 --> 00:09:55.400
to the audience the architecture
and form of a complete work.

00:09:55.400 --> 00:09:58.850
From these people I learned
a lot about collaboration,

00:09:58.850 --> 00:10:01.230
how to assemble a piece
and convey it's substance

00:10:01.230 --> 00:10:03.560 position:56%
to an audience, and how to rehearse.

00:10:03.560 --> 00:10:06.110
It was also essential to
my development as a coach

00:10:06.110 --> 00:10:08.600
of other chamber musicians.

00:10:08.600 --> 00:10:11.690
My time with the Lark Quartet
also brought experience

00:10:11.690 --> 00:10:15.790
with commissioning composers and
premiering and recording new works.

00:10:15.790 --> 00:10:19.510
The Lark was founded on the
mission to expand the repertoire

00:10:19.510 --> 00:10:21.350
through funded commissions.

00:10:21.350 --> 00:10:24.440
During these years we worked a
great deal with organizations

00:10:24.440 --> 00:10:29.600
like Chamber Music America, thank
you, applying for both residency

00:10:29.600 --> 00:10:31.290
and commissioning grants.

00:10:31.290 --> 00:10:32.820
We worked with other organizations

00:10:32.820 --> 00:10:35.400
such as the Minnesota's
Composers Forum,

00:10:35.400 --> 00:10:38.000
the National Orchestral
Association, which was funded

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:40.790
by the Judson Foundation,
and the Mars

00:10:40.790 --> 00:10:43.960
and Alma Shapiro Fund,
to name a few.

00:10:43.960 --> 00:10:47.150
Interestingly, all of these
organizations featured women

00:10:47.150 --> 00:10:49.100
in leadership roles.

00:10:49.100 --> 00:10:52.660
And it was with each of them
that we had direct communication

00:10:52.660 --> 00:10:55.860
when making our applications
for funds.

00:10:55.860 --> 00:10:58.840
Over the years the Quartet
commissioned numerous works

00:10:58.840 --> 00:11:01.580
from some of the most
celebrated composers.

00:11:01.580 --> 00:11:05.090
These pieces were significant
for our career building.

00:11:05.090 --> 00:11:08.910
Being the first ensemble to record
them helped establish the Quartet

00:11:08.910 --> 00:11:13.790
in the mainstream of the American
chamber music scene for many years.

00:11:13.790 --> 00:11:15.380
Some of the commissions
included works

00:11:15.380 --> 00:11:18.520
for string quartet plus a guest
artist, which opened the way

00:11:18.520 --> 00:11:20.890
for broader collaborations.

00:11:20.890 --> 00:11:25.580
These patrons, in ways not unlike
Elizabeth Sprague Coolidge expanded

00:11:25.580 --> 00:11:29.130
the standard repertoire and
helped advance the careers

00:11:29.130 --> 00:11:33.130
of some now very well
known female composers.

00:11:33.130 --> 00:11:37.820
When Lark traveled internationally
we were generally well received.

00:11:37.820 --> 00:11:43.180
Occasionally we would be found
"charming and adorable" [laughter]

00:11:44.300 --> 00:11:46.910
or perhaps related to as
though we were a group

00:11:46.910 --> 00:11:51.090
of girls enjoying some kind
of hobby or field trip,

00:11:51.090 --> 00:11:52.800
with frequently the assumption

00:11:52.800 --> 00:11:55.610
that making a family
would inevitably take our

00:11:55.610 --> 00:11:58.110
interests elsewhere.

00:11:58.110 --> 00:12:01.690
Over the course of the 20 plus
years since I joined the group,

00:12:01.690 --> 00:12:04.070
and since my time with
Jackie du Pre,

00:12:04.070 --> 00:12:08.090
these kinds of assumptions have
diminished somewhat, and I now work

00:12:08.090 --> 00:12:11.360
with a group of students
that is mostly female.

00:12:11.360 --> 00:12:15.030
More recently in my work at cello
professor at UMass, Mount Holyoake

00:12:15.030 --> 00:12:19.280
and elsewhere, I've observed some
of the different ways in leadership

00:12:19.280 --> 00:12:21.310
and mentoring can take shape.

00:12:21.310 --> 00:12:24.330
The students in the music
department at UMass are by

00:12:24.330 --> 00:12:27.460
and large pre-professional
musicians,

00:12:27.460 --> 00:12:31.370
focusing on cello performance
and music [inaudible].

00:12:31.370 --> 00:12:33.620
When working with these
students I draw heavily

00:12:33.620 --> 00:12:38.060
on my most profound mentorships
experiences as a student,

00:12:38.060 --> 00:12:42.600 position:56%
such as my work with Jackie du Pre
or Eugene Moye, cellist in New York,

00:12:42.600 --> 00:12:44.990
or my many others teachers
and mentors.

00:12:44.990 --> 00:12:48.050
In fact, it's not uncommon in
the middle of a lesson to feel

00:12:48.050 --> 00:12:51.430
as though I'm channeling
the advice of one or another

00:12:51.430 --> 00:12:56.210
of my many teachers, when I'm
helping a student with a problem.

00:12:56.210 --> 00:13:01.110
The how to is really in
the foreground at UMass,

00:13:01.110 --> 00:13:04.290
and the pressure is on for
immediate practical results

00:13:04.290 --> 00:13:07.460
that will prepare students
for professional work.

00:13:07.460 --> 00:13:10.380
In addition to providing
musical demonstrations,

00:13:10.380 --> 00:13:14.280
I have to provide them with a
template for entering working life

00:13:14.280 --> 00:13:18.280
as a string player, whether
that involves further study

00:13:18.280 --> 00:13:23.970
or starting orchestral auditions,
or enrolling in competitions

00:13:23.970 --> 00:13:26.160
that not only can they
play all the notes,

00:13:26.160 --> 00:13:28.390
but they have internalized
the [inaudible]

00:13:28.390 --> 00:13:31.010
of the professional
musician and are prepared

00:13:31.010 --> 00:13:33.250
to collaborate successfully.

00:13:33.250 --> 00:13:34.970
This includes the understanding
that those

00:13:34.970 --> 00:13:39.890
who take a more entrepreneurial
role are more likely to succeed.

00:13:39.890 --> 00:13:41.830 position:56%
In contrast, the liberal arts agenda

00:13:41.830 --> 00:13:44.030
at Mount Holyoake College
represents --

00:13:44.030 --> 00:13:46.040
or presents me with cello students

00:13:46.040 --> 00:13:48.710
who are frequently
majoring in other fields.

00:13:48.710 --> 00:13:52.160
My role there is to give them a
deeper understanding and sense

00:13:52.160 --> 00:13:55.210
of confidence navigating
a piece of music.

00:13:55.210 --> 00:13:58.250
As a women's college with a
tradition of preparing women

00:13:58.250 --> 00:14:01.770
for leadership, the school
values classroom experience

00:14:01.770 --> 00:14:05.540
that contributes to the basic
goals of thinking independently

00:14:05.540 --> 00:14:09.810
and analytically, speaking and
writing effectively, and connecting

00:14:09.810 --> 00:14:11.990
with the broader community.

00:14:11.990 --> 00:14:16.020 position:56%
While preparing a piece of music one
draws upon many of the analytical

00:14:16.020 --> 00:14:20.050
and communication skills
required for effective leadership.

00:14:20.050 --> 00:14:22.620
In our lessons and
coaching sessions,

00:14:22.620 --> 00:14:25.290
there are surprising numbers
of parallels that can be drawn

00:14:25.290 --> 00:14:28.050
between musical performance
and clear thinking

00:14:28.050 --> 00:14:30.110
and communication in general.

00:14:30.110 --> 00:14:34.350
In true Mount Holyoake style
orchestra members rotate leadership

00:14:34.350 --> 00:14:37.800
positions, as board
members, directors of marking

00:14:37.800 --> 00:14:40.470 position:56%
and fundraising committees and more.

00:14:40.470 --> 00:14:43.740 position:56%
They are thoroughly self-sustaining.

00:14:43.740 --> 00:14:46.780
Both of these institutions
are actively engaged

00:14:46.780 --> 00:14:49.380
to advance women in
leadership roles.

00:14:49.380 --> 00:14:54.730 position:56%
For example, as recently as last
year UMass developed a program known

00:14:54.730 --> 00:14:58.780
as Priming Women for Public
Leadership, and Mount Holyoake

00:14:58.780 --> 00:15:05.440
as a vast array of programs,
including Women Leading

00:15:05.440 --> 00:15:08.690
in Public Service Summit 2015.

00:15:08.690 --> 00:15:13.970
As I prepare to join the Juilliard
faculty and my new colleagues

00:15:13.970 --> 00:15:17.590
in the Juilliard Quartet, I am
learning more about the school

00:15:17.590 --> 00:15:21.070
and the many ways it has changed
since I was a student there.

00:15:21.070 --> 00:15:24.570
To my delight, Juilliard
has made a tremendous effort

00:15:24.570 --> 00:15:26.730
to offer a broad array of courses,

00:15:26.730 --> 00:15:31.150
to the point of creating whole
departments geared toward career

00:15:31.150 --> 00:15:34.330
building, entrepreneurship,
educational outreach,

00:15:34.330 --> 00:15:37.020
mentoring and innovation.

00:15:37.020 --> 00:15:39.880
Things have changed a
lot since I was kid.

00:15:39.880 --> 00:15:43.000
Initiatives such as Julliard's
Music Advancement program,

00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:45.940
the Boston Symphony
Orchestra's Project STEP,

00:15:45.940 --> 00:15:47.240
and the Sphinx Organization

00:15:47.240 --> 00:15:51.950
in Detroit have brought a much more
diverse generation of musicians

00:15:51.950 --> 00:15:55.120
into the world of music, and
that world is showing signs

00:15:55.120 --> 00:15:59.740
of being more inclusive and more
like the tapestry I grew up with.

00:15:59.740 --> 00:16:01.310
So it's very interesting to be here

00:16:01.310 --> 00:16:05.620
and hear what my two co panelists
will have to say about the state

00:16:05.620 --> 00:16:09.140
of women in music, but is
a very nice exploration.

00:16:09.140 --> 00:16:10.570
Thank you for inviting me.

00:16:10.570 --> 00:16:12.570
&gt;&gt; Annette McLean: Well,
you know, it's very resonate

00:16:12.570 --> 00:16:15.480
to hear your comments,
especially in this room

00:16:15.480 --> 00:16:18.140
with the [inaudible]
instruments there that were played

00:16:18.140 --> 00:16:21.600
for so many years by
the Budapest Quartet.

00:16:21.600 --> 00:16:23.960
And they were, as Robert
[inaudible] used to say,

00:16:23.960 --> 00:16:28.120
the most famous quartet known by
name in the world at that time.

00:16:28.120 --> 00:16:30.950
And our friend, June Schneider,
is here who was married

00:16:30.950 --> 00:16:34.950
to Mischa Schneider, the
cellist of the Budapest Quartet

00:16:34.950 --> 00:16:37.680
and June is a longtime -- she
came to a concert first year

00:16:37.680 --> 00:16:41.000
in 1946, so she's here tonight.

00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:42.920
And for the Juilliard
we presented them --

00:16:42.920 --> 00:16:47.290 position:56%
we have presented them for 67 of the
70 years they have been in business.

00:16:47.290 --> 00:16:50.360
So the Library is a
place where stories

00:16:50.360 --> 00:16:54.400
and relationships and
families are grown.

00:16:54.400 --> 00:16:57.260
And this -- Margaret, this
applies to you very much.

00:16:57.260 --> 00:17:00.320
We -- as I say, we feel a part
of a Chamber Music America.

00:17:00.320 --> 00:17:04.030
You have been very, very hands-on
at CMA in developing a number

00:17:04.030 --> 00:17:07.980 position:56%
of new program initiatives to
encourage a diversity of expression,

00:17:07.980 --> 00:17:10.950
and we'd love to hear about that.

00:17:10.950 --> 00:17:13.360
&gt;&gt; Margaret Lioi: Well,
I'll begin by saying

00:17:13.360 --> 00:17:20.290
that I never use GPS,
I always use a map.

00:17:21.820 --> 00:17:24.390
[Applause] Now, I'm
surprised to hear applause.

00:17:24.390 --> 00:17:28.200
I thought people would probably
say, what does that have

00:17:28.200 --> 00:17:30.640
to do with women in the arts.

00:17:30.640 --> 00:17:32.160
Everything.

00:17:32.160 --> 00:17:36.980
And the reason is, I use a map
because when I'm going on a trip I

00:17:36.980 --> 00:17:42.130
like to know not just where I'm
starting from and where I'm going,

00:17:42.130 --> 00:17:46.300
but I like to know, oh, what
does the interstate cross,

00:17:46.300 --> 00:17:49.520
and maybe there are
mountains over here, or a lake

00:17:49.520 --> 00:17:54.600
or maybe I'll take a detour,
so I like the bigger picture.

00:17:54.600 --> 00:17:59.600
And I realized that I do
the same thing in my work.

00:17:59.600 --> 00:18:05.500
I don't just think of chamber
music or even the performing arts,

00:18:05.500 --> 00:18:08.070
but I look at the bigger landscape.

00:18:08.070 --> 00:18:12.030
I look at what's happening
at economically and socially

00:18:12.030 --> 00:18:15.970
and with technology and
the political landscape.

00:18:15.970 --> 00:18:22.300
And I think that we all get a
clearer picture of where we are

00:18:22.300 --> 00:18:26.790
in the larger world, where
there might be opportunities,

00:18:26.790 --> 00:18:30.790
where there might be
gaps that we can fill in.

00:18:30.790 --> 00:18:34.470
So thinking of this conversation

00:18:34.470 --> 00:18:38.170
in the larger context
I thought I would start

00:18:38.170 --> 00:18:41.800
out where I often start out,
which is the Census Bureau.

00:18:41.800 --> 00:18:46.980
I love reading Census Bureau
statistics [laughter].

00:18:46.980 --> 00:18:52.040
I know it sounds a little boring,
but really you can find out so much

00:18:52.040 --> 00:18:56.610
about where you are and
where you might want to go.

00:18:56.610 --> 00:19:01.040
So according to the Census
Bureau women's presence

00:19:01.040 --> 00:19:06.770
in the labor force has increased
dramatically, from about 30 million

00:19:06.770 --> 00:19:12.450
in 1970 to 73 million in 2010.

00:19:12.450 --> 00:19:17.020
Now to put that into
context, in 1970 there were

00:19:17.020 --> 00:19:20.020
about 80 million workers total,

00:19:20.020 --> 00:19:25.500
so of those total workers,
about 38% were women.

00:19:25.500 --> 00:19:32.630
And in 2010 there were 154
million workers, so the percentage

00:19:32.630 --> 00:19:37.000
of women had risen to about 47%.

00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:40.630
But the types of jobs
that most women held

00:19:40.630 --> 00:19:48.020
in 1970 were dental assistants,
teachers, secretaries and nurses.

00:19:48.020 --> 00:19:52.810
And in fact, I graduated from
high school right around that time

00:19:52.810 --> 00:19:57.540
and I was one of three women
out of -- we had a class --

00:19:57.540 --> 00:20:01.560
I went to a women's high school,
we had a class of about 200.

00:20:01.560 --> 00:20:06.320
I was one of three that was
pursuing a career in the arts,

00:20:06.320 --> 00:20:08.910
all the other classmates were going

00:20:08.910 --> 00:20:12.010
to nursing school or
becoming teachers.

00:20:12.010 --> 00:20:16.480
And that was actually confirmed
at my last high school reunion,

00:20:16.480 --> 00:20:19.290
when we found that in fact most

00:20:19.290 --> 00:20:24.690
of the class had had careers
in teaching and nursing.

00:20:24.690 --> 00:20:29.160
The career guidance available
at that time for women wanting

00:20:29.160 --> 00:20:33.450
to pursue a performing
career didn't exist.

00:20:33.450 --> 00:20:36.540
I studied piano with the
Eastman School of Music

00:20:36.540 --> 00:20:41.920
in the Preparatory Division, and
my teacher wanted me to continue

00:20:41.920 --> 00:20:44.760
in the college division of Eastman,

00:20:44.760 --> 00:20:48.880
but I wanted to expand
my world view.

00:20:48.880 --> 00:20:54.380
Now expand my worldview is a
euphemism for I wanted to get

00:20:54.380 --> 00:20:57.180
out of Rochester, New
York [laughter],

00:20:58.710 --> 00:21:04.270
even though Eastman is a wonderful
school, but I just felt there had

00:21:04.270 --> 00:21:09.630 position:56%
to be a place where the sun came out
more than in Rochester, New York.

00:21:09.630 --> 00:21:15.380
Now I had absolutely no
idea what I was doing.

00:21:15.380 --> 00:21:19.080
There were some well known
women pianists at the time,

00:21:19.080 --> 00:21:22.710
but I didn't particularly
want to be a performer,

00:21:22.710 --> 00:21:27.510
I just knew that I loved
music, I loved the piano,

00:21:27.510 --> 00:21:32.600
and I wanted in some way to have
a career in the performing arts.

00:21:32.600 --> 00:21:37.300
So the way I could see that
at that time was to continue

00:21:37.300 --> 00:21:40.990
with the instrument that
I had been studying.

00:21:40.990 --> 00:21:45.220
So we'll fast forward through four
years of college and two years

00:21:45.220 --> 00:21:50.340
of graduate school, and after
six years I had much improved

00:21:50.340 --> 00:21:55.200
as a musician and had as
few prospects for employment

00:21:55.200 --> 00:21:58.800
as I had had six years before.

00:21:58.800 --> 00:22:02.550
And, again, there were few
women professors of piano

00:22:02.550 --> 00:22:04.190
at New England Conservatory.

00:22:04.190 --> 00:22:10.500 position:56%
They were not young women, and I
really could not identify with them.

00:22:10.500 --> 00:22:12.820
My old teacher was a man,

00:22:12.820 --> 00:22:17.340
a wonderful man named Jacob
Maxim, excellent teacher.

00:22:17.340 --> 00:22:18.960
I loved him.

00:22:18.960 --> 00:22:24.390
But he was not a mentor,
he was very reclusive.

00:22:24.390 --> 00:22:29.540
As a matter of fact, he himself had
stopped performing because he had

00:22:29.540 --> 00:22:33.190
such anxiety before
he got onto the stage.

00:22:33.190 --> 00:22:35.120
And so I thought, I'm not sure

00:22:35.120 --> 00:22:39.450
that that's really the person
I want for a mentor [laughter].

00:22:39.450 --> 00:22:41.300
But we remained close,

00:22:41.300 --> 00:22:45.390
he just passed away recently,
he was a wonderful man.

00:22:45.390 --> 00:22:49.370
But after I graduated I
became a freelance musician,

00:22:49.370 --> 00:22:51.700
primarily for vocalists.

00:22:51.700 --> 00:22:55.750
And this actually turned into
a career as an accompanist,

00:22:55.750 --> 00:22:59.700
which is now of course
called collaborative piano.

00:22:59.700 --> 00:23:03.860
And I often say, if it had
truly been collaborative

00:23:03.860 --> 00:23:07.510
when I was doing it I would have
remained in that profession.

00:23:07.510 --> 00:23:10.090
[ Laughter ]

00:23:10.090 --> 00:23:13.890
I played with some
wonderful musicians, I toured,

00:23:13.890 --> 00:23:18.180
I played for opera rehearsals and
dance classes and music theater,

00:23:18.180 --> 00:23:20.440
you name it and I played for it.

00:23:20.440 --> 00:23:25.750
Freelancers live in fear of
never getting another job,

00:23:25.750 --> 00:23:30.610
so you take any job at any
time that comes your way,

00:23:30.610 --> 00:23:34.620
and that becomes its own
problem which is another panel,

00:23:34.620 --> 00:23:37.490
which we'll schedule
some time [laughter].

00:23:37.490 --> 00:23:40.980
So this went on until I turned 30,

00:23:40.980 --> 00:23:48.690 position:56%
and I had this really lightning bolt
realization that I had no savings,

00:23:48.690 --> 00:23:52.960
no stability, I was
working seven days a week,

00:23:52.960 --> 00:23:55.970
and I had lost a clear direction.

00:23:55.970 --> 00:23:59.280
My direction became maintenance.

00:23:59.280 --> 00:24:05.000
Did I have enough money for
rent, food, and gas for my car.

00:24:05.000 --> 00:24:09.840
It was a very short-term plan,
very short-term existence.

00:24:09.840 --> 00:24:12.620
So at that time I met a woman

00:24:12.620 --> 00:24:16.860
who was getting an MBA
in Arts Administration.

00:24:16.860 --> 00:24:21.210
I had no idea that
such a thing existed.

00:24:21.210 --> 00:24:26.510
There was actually a job
called an Arts Administrator.

00:24:26.510 --> 00:24:31.920
And it does seem ridiculous to
me now, but at that time I was

00:24:31.920 --> 00:24:35.610
so focused on playing that
it never occurred to me

00:24:35.610 --> 00:24:38.350
that someone was actually in charge

00:24:38.350 --> 00:24:42.160
of the organizations
that were hiring me.

00:24:42.160 --> 00:24:47.250
So let's -- we'll fast forward
again for another couple of years.

00:24:47.250 --> 00:24:49.980 position:56%
I did get my MBA and I began to work

00:24:49.980 --> 00:24:54.230
for arts organizations
on the business side.

00:24:54.230 --> 00:24:57.940
So now that I'm running
a national organization,

00:24:57.940 --> 00:25:03.340
I'd like to share a few things
that I have observed in my career.

00:25:03.340 --> 00:25:08.870
They're not necessarily related,
but they all sort of fit the idea

00:25:08.870 --> 00:25:12.290
that we're talking about tonight.

00:25:12.290 --> 00:25:15.400
I've never had a female boss.

00:25:15.400 --> 00:25:20.060
Every organization I've worked
for has been led by men.

00:25:20.060 --> 00:25:25.330
They're wonderful, smart,
talented, creative and charismatic,

00:25:25.330 --> 00:25:33.770
but I think it's interesting that
since I had come up in my career,

00:25:33.770 --> 00:25:38.120
so many more organizations
are run by women.

00:25:38.120 --> 00:25:41.110
And I'll get to that
in just a moment.

00:25:41.110 --> 00:25:45.080
According to the National
Partnership for Women and Families,

00:25:45.080 --> 00:25:52.130
on average, women earn 77 cents
for every dollar earned by men.

00:25:52.130 --> 00:25:56.910
And I did experience this firsthand
when I moved to New York to work

00:25:56.910 --> 00:25:58.810
for the Charitable Trust.

00:25:58.810 --> 00:26:01.030 position:56%
My predecessor had been a gentleman,

00:26:01.030 --> 00:26:05.130
and since I was the
trust's chief administrator,

00:26:05.130 --> 00:26:08.010
I had payroll responsibilities.

00:26:08.010 --> 00:26:14.260
So in reviewing the payroll records
it came to [laughter] my attention

00:26:14.260 --> 00:26:22.920
that I was being paid exactly
50% less than he had been paid.

00:26:22.920 --> 00:26:26.060
That was quite a shock.

00:26:26.060 --> 00:26:31.560
There are still very few
mentorship programs for women

00:26:31.560 --> 00:26:36.550
who are interested in pursuing
arts administration career paths.

00:26:36.550 --> 00:26:39.370
There are many women who
are members of ensembles

00:26:39.370 --> 00:26:44.250
and notably some ensembles are
composed entirely of women.

00:26:44.250 --> 00:26:49.950
But there are still relatively
few women in major orchestras.

00:26:49.950 --> 00:26:51.940
The paths from performing

00:26:51.940 --> 00:26:55.070
to administration are
very serendipitous.

00:26:55.070 --> 00:26:59.400
There are few official structures
where performers can know

00:26:59.400 --> 00:27:05.890
about the existence of arts jobs
and arts administration programs.

00:27:05.890 --> 00:27:10.140
The wage discrepancy issue that I
mentioned earlier has been talked

00:27:10.140 --> 00:27:15.540
about for years, but another
aspect of this conversation

00:27:15.540 --> 00:27:20.330
that women continue to face
is the work/life balance.

00:27:20.330 --> 00:27:23.540
Our cultural understanding
of mothers

00:27:23.540 --> 00:27:27.890
and fathers roles really
must be further examined,

00:27:27.890 --> 00:27:34.700 position:56%
and our administrative work places
need to become more family friendly.

00:27:34.700 --> 00:27:37.470
Young women who look to
the arts for careers have

00:27:37.470 --> 00:27:42.990
so many high profile role models
now that didn't exist years ago.

00:27:42.990 --> 00:27:47.630
In addition to my co panelists
who have very high profile

00:27:47.630 --> 00:27:52.220
and prominent jobs in the
arts, there's Deborah Borda

00:27:52.220 --> 00:27:55.870
who is president and CEO of
the Los Angeles Philharmonic,

00:27:55.870 --> 00:27:59.070
and the Fellow New England
Conservatory [inaudible] I'm happy

00:27:59.070 --> 00:28:00.370
to say.

00:28:00.370 --> 00:28:04.900
There's your own Deborah Rutter who
is president of the Kennedy Center,

00:28:04.900 --> 00:28:08.020
and before that of
the Chicago Symphony.

00:28:08.020 --> 00:28:12.870
And we just saw Marin Alsop, Music
Director of the Baltimore Symphony.

00:28:12.870 --> 00:28:17.700
So these women who are prominent
in the arts, in administration,

00:28:17.700 --> 00:28:23.600
and in performing, and they
can become now role models

00:28:23.600 --> 00:28:25.310
for the younger generation.

00:28:25.310 --> 00:28:29.640
They have become role
models for younger women.

00:28:29.640 --> 00:28:34.080
So I have a vision for the field
of arts of administration that I'd

00:28:34.080 --> 00:28:39.180
like to share with
you for the year 2025.

00:28:39.180 --> 00:28:42.770
We'll reconvene then maybe,
Anne, and we'll have this panel

00:28:42.770 --> 00:28:45.970
and see if we've gotten there.

00:28:45.970 --> 00:28:50.730
Learning the principles of arts
administration will be required

00:28:50.730 --> 00:28:54.070
for anyone studying
the performing arts.

00:28:54.070 --> 00:28:57.140
This will be the norm
and not the exception.

00:28:57.140 --> 00:29:00.730
For those seeking arts
administration careers,

00:29:00.730 --> 00:29:05.140
paid internships will
part of their curriculum.

00:29:05.140 --> 00:29:09.620
Salaries in arts administration
positions will not be lower

00:29:09.620 --> 00:29:12.900
than their counterparts
in the for profit arena.

00:29:12.900 --> 00:29:18.490
And artists and arts administrators
will be welcomed additions

00:29:18.490 --> 00:29:22.680
to the boards of civic
organizations and corporations

00:29:22.680 --> 00:29:26.020
because of the creativity
and innovative thinking

00:29:26.020 --> 00:29:28.190
that they bring to the table.

00:29:28.190 --> 00:29:33.870
And there will be parody among men
and women in wages, family care,

00:29:33.870 --> 00:29:37.370
and job opportunities
throughout the field.

00:29:37.370 --> 00:29:40.180
I think we can do it,
and I look forward

00:29:40.180 --> 00:29:42.320
to being a part of that world.

00:29:42.320 --> 00:29:44.120
Thank you.

00:29:44.120 --> 00:29:50.110
[ Applause ]

00:29:50.110 --> 00:29:51.410
&gt;&gt; Annette McLean: Wonderful.

00:29:51.410 --> 00:29:54.380
And Chairman Chu, you have
the very broadest overview

00:29:54.380 --> 00:29:57.310
of all aspects of music
in our nation.

00:29:57.310 --> 00:30:00.660
&gt;&gt; Jane Chu: Well, I -- now
I'm in a position where I focus

00:30:00.660 --> 00:30:05.190
on all the arts, all the
genders, and appreciate them all.

00:30:05.190 --> 00:30:09.720
But I come today with a perspective
of my own love for music,

00:30:09.720 --> 00:30:11.210
and my own musical training

00:30:11.210 --> 00:30:16.130
and how it has informed
my own leadership style.

00:30:16.130 --> 00:30:18.910
I don't think that there's
ever been a better time

00:30:18.910 --> 00:30:22.660
to appreciate what the arts can
provide in terms of leadership.

00:30:22.660 --> 00:30:26.190
Because we live in this world that
is filled with constant change,

00:30:26.190 --> 00:30:29.000
and there's new information
flying toward us

00:30:29.000 --> 00:30:31.760
from multiple directions
simultaneously

00:30:31.760 --> 00:30:35.800
and everybody has an opinion and
everybody wants the opinion heard.

00:30:35.800 --> 00:30:39.620
And so we need creative
leaders who will sort through

00:30:39.620 --> 00:30:41.390
and bring together
those [inaudible] pieces

00:30:41.390 --> 00:30:44.660
and who will find new
solutions to be able

00:30:44.660 --> 00:30:46.840
to bridge those opposing
perspectives.

00:30:46.840 --> 00:30:51.380
And for me, and possible for
you, and certainly my panelists,

00:30:51.380 --> 00:30:57.070 position:56%
the arts are a key piece in building
new paths toward this common ground.

00:30:57.070 --> 00:30:59.600
So I was born into
multiple cultures,

00:30:59.600 --> 00:31:02.000
often with seemingly
opposing perspectives,

00:31:02.000 --> 00:31:04.910
and if I had not been involved
in the arts I'm not sure

00:31:04.910 --> 00:31:08.170
that I would have been able to
make as much sense of my own life.

00:31:08.170 --> 00:31:12.060
My parents met in the United
States, but both came from China,

00:31:12.060 --> 00:31:15.880
during a time when their home
country was in a lot of turmoil.

00:31:15.880 --> 00:31:21.730
They came to America in the
1940s, or 1948 and 1949,

00:31:21.730 --> 00:31:24.080
and they never saw
their families again.

00:31:24.080 --> 00:31:27.780
I on the other hand was born in
Oklahoma and I grew up in Arkansas,

00:31:27.780 --> 00:31:32.590
11,000 miles away from China,
and equally as far away

00:31:32.590 --> 00:31:35.410
from the traditional
Chinese way of life.

00:31:35.410 --> 00:31:40.160
So I juggled living in two
opposite cultures simultaneously.

00:31:40.160 --> 00:31:42.580
They spoke Mandarin
to each other at home,

00:31:42.580 --> 00:31:44.700 position:56%
but they wanted me to speak English.

00:31:44.700 --> 00:31:46.810
They liked to eat bok
choy and noodles,

00:31:46.810 --> 00:31:50.510
I liked to eat pizza and corn dogs.

00:31:50.510 --> 00:31:55.150
So I've really grown up navigating
through situations where people

00:31:55.150 --> 00:31:57.380
around me have different
perspectives,

00:31:57.380 --> 00:32:00.470
and many times they're opposite
from each other, and learning how

00:32:00.470 --> 00:32:03.890
to appreciate those bok
choy/corn dog settings

00:32:03.890 --> 00:32:08.250
without force fitting everybody
to be exactly like each other.

00:32:08.250 --> 00:32:10.620
And in the midst of
those settings the arts,

00:32:10.620 --> 00:32:15.040 position:56%
and in particular my music training,
have been the most soothing form

00:32:15.040 --> 00:32:18.220
of expression and of
communication for me.

00:32:18.220 --> 00:32:22.270 position:56%
And so they opened the door for me
to develop my own leadership skills.

00:32:22.270 --> 00:32:24.660
And I've come to realize
that the type

00:32:24.660 --> 00:32:28.570 position:56%
of really effective leadership
that's needed for tomorrow's leaders

00:32:28.570 --> 00:32:32.570
and probably for today boils
down to only one thing,

00:32:32.570 --> 00:32:36.820
and that is how we do
something, how we lead is just

00:32:36.820 --> 00:32:38.740
as important as what we do.

00:32:38.740 --> 00:32:42.300
How we do something is just
as important as what we do.

00:32:42.300 --> 00:32:44.970
And I can say without reservation

00:32:44.970 --> 00:32:48.940
that my own musical training
has given me techniques to use

00:32:48.940 --> 00:32:50.820
when working with others,
for example,

00:32:50.820 --> 00:32:52.940
in working with different styles.

00:32:52.940 --> 00:32:57.000
Even if you have a job where
you work mostly in solitude,

00:32:57.000 --> 00:33:00.880
there will always be times
when you work alongside others.

00:33:00.880 --> 00:33:04.200
And when you work with others
you will encounter people

00:33:04.200 --> 00:33:07.250
with different styles,
different ways of doing things,

00:33:07.250 --> 00:33:10.700
certainly different perspectives
from yours, and this can happen

00:33:10.700 --> 00:33:12.800
with the smallest nuance.

00:33:12.800 --> 00:33:16.770
You might make a comment as a
leader, and somebody on your team,

00:33:16.770 --> 00:33:19.890
because they have a
completely learning style,

00:33:19.890 --> 00:33:23.780
may interpret your comment in
a completely different way.

00:33:23.780 --> 00:33:26.250
So working with other
people also requires

00:33:26.250 --> 00:33:32.050
that I have an understanding of how
my coworkers assemble information,

00:33:32.050 --> 00:33:35.850
how they make decisions,
how they act at work.

00:33:35.850 --> 00:33:39.560
I don't perform Beethoven the
same way I perform [inaudible],

00:33:39.560 --> 00:33:44.230
and I don't approach a coworker
who is focused upon facts

00:33:44.230 --> 00:33:48.280
and logical analysis the same
way I approach another coworker

00:33:48.280 --> 00:33:51.550
who is focused on whether
they feel good in a situation.

00:33:51.550 --> 00:33:55.080
And so in one of my previous
jobs I had a board member

00:33:55.080 --> 00:33:59.360
who had almost the exact
opposite style from me,

00:33:59.360 --> 00:34:02.720
and this board member turned out
to be one of my greatest gifts.

00:34:02.720 --> 00:34:06.510 position:56%
Because I had to really prepare
myself when I communicated with him,

00:34:06.510 --> 00:34:11.240
and sometimes sending him an e-mail
message took a long time for me

00:34:11.240 --> 00:34:14.080
to compose even a paragraph,
because I knew

00:34:14.080 --> 00:34:17.030
that he would read
the message from me

00:34:17.030 --> 00:34:19.370
from his own perspective
and now mine.

00:34:19.370 --> 00:34:23.580
So I couldn't insert any
shorthand words or make any leaps

00:34:23.580 --> 00:34:26.530
because he would either
jump to the wrong conclusion

00:34:26.530 --> 00:34:28.220
or he would just not get it.

00:34:28.220 --> 00:34:31.800
But he was such a good board member
and he had so much information

00:34:31.800 --> 00:34:35.020
and experience that would
make the organization better,

00:34:35.020 --> 00:34:38.630
as long as I understood how
to communicate with him.

00:34:38.630 --> 00:34:41.120
So thank goodness for
my musical training,

00:34:41.120 --> 00:34:46.000
because if the board member was,
say, a Hindemith piano sonata

00:34:46.000 --> 00:34:51.090 position:56%
and I was a Scarlatti sonata then I
made sure that I learned how to play

00:34:51.090 --> 00:34:52.670
in the style of Hindemith.

00:34:52.670 --> 00:34:56.990
And so as a result I became
a far more versatile leader,

00:34:56.990 --> 00:34:59.200
with more tools in my
leadership tool belt

00:34:59.200 --> 00:35:01.750
as a result of my musical training.

00:35:01.750 --> 00:35:05.450
In listening to others, and
paying attention how to listen

00:35:05.450 --> 00:35:08.730
to my environment, my
musical training taught me how

00:35:08.730 --> 00:35:10.440
to listen with a keen ear.

00:35:10.440 --> 00:35:14.670
So to hear the nuances of
a composition, many people,

00:35:14.670 --> 00:35:17.070
perhaps most, can tell
the difference

00:35:17.070 --> 00:35:20.230
between loud versus quiet.

00:35:20.230 --> 00:35:25.470
But my musical training taught
me to differentiate between forte

00:35:25.470 --> 00:35:31.090
and [inaudible] between loud and
not quite as loud, but not quiet.

00:35:31.090 --> 00:35:35.040
And so to move at an andante
tempo instead of [inaudible],

00:35:35.040 --> 00:35:39.210
so not just moving fast or
slowly, but knowing the differences

00:35:39.210 --> 00:35:40.720
in the speeds of walking.

00:35:40.720 --> 00:35:44.960
So is it time for me to race walk
or do I need to walk leisurely.

00:35:44.960 --> 00:35:50.960
This same ability to discern these
subtleties lets us listen intently

00:35:50.960 --> 00:35:55.920
to others, and that keep ear
training differentiates leaders

00:35:55.920 --> 00:35:59.210
who are really good listeners
from leaders who pay no attention

00:35:59.210 --> 00:36:00.810
to those they're leading.

00:36:00.810 --> 00:36:05.280
And really great listening skills
allow us to move our relationship

00:36:05.280 --> 00:36:09.920
from surface to deep, because your
staff is no longer just following

00:36:09.920 --> 00:36:12.750
you because you're the anointed
the leader, they're following you

00:36:12.750 --> 00:36:14.780
because they felt heard by you.

00:36:14.780 --> 00:36:18.480
And you're ability to listen
to others can transform them

00:36:18.480 --> 00:36:22.630
because they have experienced your
in-depth ability to hear them,

00:36:22.630 --> 00:36:25.050
and discern the subtleties.

00:36:25.050 --> 00:36:26.530
In pulling people together,

00:36:26.530 --> 00:36:29.780
leadership ability is highly
dependent upon being able

00:36:29.780 --> 00:36:31.120
to pull people together,

00:36:31.120 --> 00:36:34.350
and you can't really lead
unless you have followers.

00:36:34.350 --> 00:36:36.720
And often the people that
you're pulling together,

00:36:36.720 --> 00:36:38.730
not only come from
different perspectives,

00:36:38.730 --> 00:36:42.750
but they may also not share
the same objectives as you.

00:36:42.750 --> 00:36:45.540
So when do you give a people --

00:36:45.540 --> 00:36:48.960
a group of people free
reign to express themselves

00:36:48.960 --> 00:36:51.800
in a manner that's different
from you, and when do you reign

00:36:51.800 --> 00:36:53.620
in everybody in the group

00:36:53.620 --> 00:36:57.360
so that together you can
accomplish a single objective.

00:36:57.360 --> 00:37:01.240
Composers ask those same questions
about the music they write.

00:37:01.240 --> 00:37:03.380
They look for the times
and the pieces of music

00:37:03.380 --> 00:37:07.370
where a single musician
might take a riff on her own,

00:37:07.370 --> 00:37:08.990
and they look for other
times when all

00:37:08.990 --> 00:37:11.260
of the performers have
come back together

00:37:11.260 --> 00:37:13.070
for the sake of the composition.

00:37:13.070 --> 00:37:17.790
And my musical training has helped
me understand when one voice needs

00:37:17.790 --> 00:37:21.680
to be prominent and when to
bring that voice back down

00:37:21.680 --> 00:37:25.650
and let another different voice
step out and make itself known.

00:37:25.650 --> 00:37:30.360
Really effective leaders know when
to step forward, but they also know

00:37:30.360 --> 00:37:33.240
when to hold back so
that others can lead.

00:37:33.240 --> 00:37:35.980
They know when to dance with
exuberance and they know

00:37:35.980 --> 00:37:39.250
when to be sensitive to
the stillness of the music.

00:37:39.250 --> 00:37:45.180 position:56%
And here's the key, neither approach
is right by itself all the time.

00:37:45.180 --> 00:37:49.540
And an effective leader
understands this same context.

00:37:49.540 --> 00:37:52.400
And because the arts are
a form of communication,

00:37:52.400 --> 00:37:55.510 position:56%
and we know that there are
different ways to express ourselves,

00:37:55.510 --> 00:37:59.090
we can pay close attention
to what someone is saying,

00:37:59.090 --> 00:38:02.420
even if they're using a different
vocabulary set, because, after all,

00:38:02.420 --> 00:38:06.250
expressing ourselves through the
arts is just using a different

00:38:06.250 --> 00:38:07.870
vocabulary set.

00:38:07.870 --> 00:38:10.710
So I'm an only child, and
I was the first generation

00:38:10.710 --> 00:38:12.650
to be born in the United States.

00:38:12.650 --> 00:38:16.040
And I spoke English in my school
life and my parents spoke Mandarin

00:38:16.040 --> 00:38:19.440
in my home life, and my
parents were not musicians,

00:38:19.440 --> 00:38:23.620
nor were they arts aficionado,
but when my father died of cancer

00:38:23.620 --> 00:38:26.280 position:56%
when I was nine, those piano lessons

00:38:26.280 --> 00:38:30.430
that I had been taking dutifully
turned out to be the only form

00:38:30.430 --> 00:38:35.230
of expression I could use to
articulate my own grief as a child.

00:38:35.230 --> 00:38:38.420
Because music gave me a broader
vocabulary than just the use

00:38:38.420 --> 00:38:40.330
of linear everyday words,

00:38:40.330 --> 00:38:43.250
and my music training
has helped me understand

00:38:43.250 --> 00:38:47.140
that as a leader I can pay
attention to the ways others learn.

00:38:47.140 --> 00:38:50.690
And at the heart of my musical
training was creativity,

00:38:50.690 --> 00:38:55.140
so it's that same creativity that
allows us to see the patterns

00:38:55.140 --> 00:38:57.380
and the connections
and the possibilities

00:38:57.380 --> 00:38:59.100
when others don't see them.

00:38:59.100 --> 00:39:04.330
To acquire meaning and value and
to build something from nothing,

00:39:04.330 --> 00:39:07.130
to transcend those
situations which may appear

00:39:07.130 --> 00:39:10.620
to have only one solution,
or possibly none,

00:39:10.620 --> 00:39:14.160 position:56%
the creativity gives us that ability
to see things in a different way

00:39:14.160 --> 00:39:17.800
and it involves courage to step
out and do something in a way

00:39:17.800 --> 00:39:20.080
that hasn't been done before.

00:39:20.080 --> 00:39:24.740
Many of us in the arts are
here because we need to create

00:39:24.740 --> 00:39:27.590
and we need to find ways
to innovate, and to be able

00:39:27.590 --> 00:39:31.680
to use technologies, to deal with
change, and to take those resources

00:39:31.680 --> 00:39:34.480
that are available to us
at any moment in time,

00:39:34.480 --> 00:39:38.560
whether our resources are
abundant or whether they're scarce,

00:39:38.560 --> 00:39:42.780
and use whatever we have to
create value and meaning.

00:39:42.780 --> 00:39:47.000
And as leaders in creative fields,
we have this great opportunity

00:39:47.000 --> 00:39:51.080
to provoke and create and
inspire, and we have an opportunity

00:39:51.080 --> 00:39:54.590
to be lifelong learners
so that we won't be boxed

00:39:54.590 --> 00:39:57.510
in by the same old tired arguments.

00:39:57.510 --> 00:40:01.320
We have an opportunity to stand in
the midst of different perspectives

00:40:01.320 --> 00:40:05.260
without shrinking back, and to
provide a working environment

00:40:05.260 --> 00:40:08.300
that allows people to
generate new insights

00:40:08.300 --> 00:40:11.150
and solve old problems in new ways.

00:40:11.150 --> 00:40:14.020
To embolden creativity in
others and pay attention

00:40:14.020 --> 00:40:17.340
to those fresh approaches
and ways of thinking.

00:40:17.340 --> 00:40:21.000
So whether you have taken an
oath of office, as I have,

00:40:21.000 --> 00:40:24.340
or you've started a company,
or you've introduced an idea

00:40:24.340 --> 00:40:28.930
through a new approach, the arts
can bring together ideas and people

00:40:28.930 --> 00:40:33.590
and perspectives, and from them
generate something beyond what we

00:40:33.590 --> 00:40:36.110
could have envisioned on our own.

00:40:36.110 --> 00:40:39.950
The arts an integral
component to my own leadership,

00:40:39.950 --> 00:40:42.770
and not just because I'm
working in the arts field,

00:40:42.770 --> 00:40:47.020
but because the arts have taught
me that how we do something is just

00:40:47.020 --> 00:40:49.340
as important as what we
do, and that's the kind

00:40:49.340 --> 00:40:50.790
of leadership that I'm aiming for.

00:40:50.790 --> 00:40:53.510
Thank you.

00:40:53.510 --> 00:41:00.350
[ Applause ]

00:41:00.350 --> 00:41:01.910
&gt;&gt; Annette McLean: You know, while
you were speaking [inaudible]

00:41:01.910 --> 00:41:06.750
from Mrs. Coolidge that one
can hear sometimes in our --

00:41:06.750 --> 00:41:09.990
later in our exhibit, but it's
so resonant at this moment,

00:41:09.990 --> 00:41:13.640
she said how wonderful it
would be to have in the cabinet

00:41:13.640 --> 00:41:16.720
of secretary of fine arts.

00:41:16.720 --> 00:41:19.160
This is a wonderful
opportunity for us

00:41:19.160 --> 00:41:22.950
to congratulate you on
being that secretary.

00:41:22.950 --> 00:41:24.280
&gt;&gt; Jane Chu: Thank you.

00:41:24.280 --> 00:41:26.530
&gt;&gt; Annette McLean: Let's -- I
wanted to just take a quick --

00:41:26.530 --> 00:41:30.380 position:56%
before we go further, I wanted to
ask you a couple of quick questions,

00:41:30.380 --> 00:41:32.320
and think about this for a moment.

00:41:32.320 --> 00:41:35.300
How do we -- we talked about
how you define leadership,

00:41:35.300 --> 00:41:38.730
how would you define the
success, that's one thing.

00:41:38.730 --> 00:41:42.040
Do you have any comments for
people about how do you --

00:41:42.040 --> 00:41:44.840
how does one develop
an authentic voice?

00:41:44.840 --> 00:41:49.030
Tonight we'll hear Meredith
Monk, who has spent 50 years,

00:41:49.030 --> 00:41:51.940
she's celebrating 50
years as an artist,

00:41:51.940 --> 00:41:57.240
developing a very unique
authentic voice of her own.

00:41:57.240 --> 00:42:01.370
Is there any comment you would
care to make on that question,

00:42:01.370 --> 00:42:06.900
how to be an authentic self in
this process of becoming a leader.

00:42:06.900 --> 00:42:08.200
That's a big question, I know.

00:42:08.200 --> 00:42:11.930
And then, okay, while you're
resonating on that [laughter],

00:42:11.930 --> 00:42:14.510
while you're thinking about that,

00:42:14.510 --> 00:42:19.760
your Creativity Connects initiative
involves three different sectors,

00:42:19.760 --> 00:42:23.350
business, private, giving
and corporate involvement.

00:42:23.350 --> 00:42:25.450
Can you talk a little
bit about that?

00:42:25.450 --> 00:42:27.750
&gt;&gt; Jane Chu: Well, we're launching
an initiative called Creativity

00:42:27.750 --> 00:42:30.310
Connects, and it really is
because we're starting to look

00:42:30.310 --> 00:42:34.630
across the nation and we're
seeing that the arts are not off

00:42:34.630 --> 00:42:37.860
in a corner by themselves,
and they're not a frill,

00:42:37.860 --> 00:42:43.140
but they infuse our lives every
day in so many different ways.

00:42:43.140 --> 00:42:46.450
And sometimes they're the
beauty of arts themselves,

00:42:46.450 --> 00:42:49.370
that's certainly the way
I came into the arts.

00:42:49.370 --> 00:42:54.210
But we also see that they spike
creativity in other settings,

00:42:54.210 --> 00:42:55.570
just as you had talked about --

00:42:55.570 --> 00:42:58.510
both of you had talked about
before, Margaret and Astrid.

00:42:58.510 --> 00:43:03.780
And so the Creativity Connects
initiative is an opportunity not

00:43:03.780 --> 00:43:06.850
only to see the new ways
people are creating --

00:43:06.850 --> 00:43:09.800
I was trained and I don't
-- maybe you were too,

00:43:09.800 --> 00:43:12.910
but I was trained certainly that
when I wanted to either practice

00:43:12.910 --> 00:43:18.200
or create on my own, to sequester
myself by myself in a room,

00:43:18.200 --> 00:43:21.020
shut the door, don't get
tainted by these people

00:43:21.020 --> 00:43:26.410
because you want the purity and the
authenticity of my own creation.

00:43:26.410 --> 00:43:29.200
What I love about that
is I don't ever want

00:43:29.200 --> 00:43:31.180
to give up my own authenticity.

00:43:31.180 --> 00:43:35.420 position:56%
But what I see is that I can do that
still and be in the room and learn

00:43:35.420 --> 00:43:37.050
from others at the same time.

00:43:37.050 --> 00:43:39.430
So the Creativity Connects
initiative is

00:43:39.430 --> 00:43:42.630
about hooking the arts
to other areas.

00:43:42.630 --> 00:43:46.120
Arts in -- connected to
business, arts connected

00:43:46.120 --> 00:43:49.380
to other sectors that
want creativity.

00:43:49.380 --> 00:43:52.910
Science, technology, you
can think of all kinds

00:43:52.910 --> 00:43:56.060
of design, fashion, culinary.

00:43:56.060 --> 00:44:00.460
So you'll start seeing, in
addition to what we currently find,

00:44:00.460 --> 00:44:07.070
we'll add another program to spike
having arts be in other sectors.

00:44:07.070 --> 00:44:10.040
Because other sectors are
starting to say, wait a minute,

00:44:10.040 --> 00:44:13.790
we need the mindset of
an artist, because we --

00:44:13.790 --> 00:44:16.830
they are already helping us
solve old problems in new ways.

00:44:16.830 --> 00:44:19.340
So that's what the
initiative is about.

00:44:19.340 --> 00:44:20.640
&gt;&gt; Annette McLean: Beautiful.

00:44:20.640 --> 00:44:23.360
Back to success, any
thoughts on how you feel?

00:44:23.360 --> 00:44:26.760 position:56%
Because it's interesting, that's one
of the things that comes up a lot

00:44:26.760 --> 00:44:28.320 position:56%
when you read about these questions.

00:44:28.320 --> 00:44:30.130
You know, you talked about
the work/life balance,

00:44:30.130 --> 00:44:33.160
and there's a book now, <i>Unfinished
Business </i>by Anne-Marie Slaughter,

00:44:33.160 --> 00:44:35.530
that's a brand new book,
that talks about this.

00:44:35.530 --> 00:44:38.080
And it talks about the culture,

00:44:38.080 --> 00:44:43.950 position:56%
how we need to develop societal
mechanisms for balancing care giving

00:44:43.950 --> 00:44:46.070 position:56%
for the very old and the very young.

00:44:46.070 --> 00:44:49.290 position:56%
And whether there is a way that our
economic structure can support that,

00:44:49.290 --> 00:44:50.890
that is a huge question.

00:44:50.890 --> 00:44:54.080
But then, you know, faced with
those challenges, what is success

00:44:54.080 --> 00:44:56.760
at a different point in
a women artists life,

00:44:56.760 --> 00:45:00.930
a women administrator's life,
that's an important question.

00:45:00.930 --> 00:45:05.770
Are there any other thoughts
on the concept of vision?

00:45:05.770 --> 00:45:09.440
Because back to Mrs. Coolidge,
she's the inspiration for this,

00:45:09.440 --> 00:45:12.670
have you had any thoughts
about when you knew you were

00:45:12.670 --> 00:45:14.970
on the right track?

00:45:16.150 --> 00:45:19.320
&gt;&gt; Margaret Lioi: I'm still
waiting to find out [laughter].

00:45:19.320 --> 00:45:24.520
You know, it's interesting
thinking about vision and success.

00:45:25.660 --> 00:45:31.060 position:56%
I think what -- I think an important
thing, certainly an important thing

00:45:31.060 --> 00:45:36.650 position:56%
that we talk to our musician members
about is -- well, two things.

00:45:36.650 --> 00:45:42.610
One is, certainly when I
was performing as a pianist,

00:45:42.610 --> 00:45:47.990
there was a very clear
hierarchical structure.

00:45:47.990 --> 00:45:51.820
So, you know, you would
play for ballet classes,

00:45:51.820 --> 00:45:56.140
and then that was sort of
the low rung for pianists.

00:45:56.140 --> 00:46:01.740
And then you would maybe play for
education programs in schools.

00:46:01.740 --> 00:46:04.850
Then you might get
a gig with a singer

00:46:04.850 --> 00:46:08.110
and you could have a
few weeks of the tour.

00:46:08.110 --> 00:46:11.800
And I'm sure it was the
same for string players.

00:46:11.800 --> 00:46:20.020 position:56%
You would start doing things to get
credentials, but your goal was to go

00:46:20.020 --> 00:46:25.650
up the ladder, and eventually
play, you know, at Carnegie Hall

00:46:25.650 --> 00:46:27.730
or at the Kennedy Center.

00:46:27.730 --> 00:46:35.730
And now success is not looked
at so much as a vertical line,

00:46:35.730 --> 00:46:39.520
but much more as a
horizontal continuum.

00:46:39.520 --> 00:46:45.200
So that people who play
engagements in schools,

00:46:45.200 --> 00:46:48.740
education is so important,
and reaching young people is

00:46:48.740 --> 00:46:53.080
so important, and they'll
do that maybe on a Thursday,

00:46:53.080 --> 00:46:55.970
and then on Friday they're
playing in the concert hall.

00:46:55.970 --> 00:46:59.300
And then on Saturday maybe
they decide they're playing

00:46:59.300 --> 00:47:01.910
in a coffee shop, just
to reach people

00:47:01.910 --> 00:47:04.330
that maybe didn't come
to the concert hall.

00:47:04.330 --> 00:47:08.500
So musicians and administrators

00:47:08.500 --> 00:47:14.270 position:56%
as well I think are defining success
not as starting at the bottom

00:47:14.270 --> 00:47:19.500
and going to the top, but what
makes you happy every day,

00:47:19.500 --> 00:47:22.560
what makes you fulfilled every day.

00:47:22.560 --> 00:47:24.260 position:56%
And I think that's a big difference.

00:47:24.260 --> 00:47:33.230
I think that technology and
expressing yourself publically

00:47:33.230 --> 00:47:37.520
in a different kind
of way from certainly

00:47:37.520 --> 00:47:41.800
when I was a younger person,
that was not acceptable.

00:47:41.800 --> 00:47:44.600
There were -- there were only
a few people who were allowed

00:47:44.600 --> 00:47:48.440
to have opinions and those people
were called critics [laughter].

00:47:48.440 --> 00:47:51.100
And it isn't that way anymore.

00:47:51.100 --> 00:47:56.330
So I think that success has
redefined itself really.

00:47:56.330 --> 00:47:57.630
&gt;&gt; Annette McLean: Excellent.

00:47:57.630 --> 00:47:58.930
Excellent.

00:47:58.930 --> 00:48:00.230
You talked the other day

00:48:00.230 --> 00:48:03.610
about having said something there
many kinds of artistic excellences

00:48:03.610 --> 00:48:07.110
in many paths, and I --
that -- I remembered that.

00:48:07.110 --> 00:48:11.350
This has been very interesting,
and we appreciate your thoughts

00:48:11.350 --> 00:48:13.350
on the subject of leadership.

00:48:13.350 --> 00:48:15.330
And I know that time is
running out so I want

00:48:15.330 --> 00:48:16.780
to give the audience a chance

00:48:16.780 --> 00:48:18.940
to ask some questions,
if you would like to.

00:48:18.940 --> 00:48:21.770
We can open it up now
for just a few moment.

00:48:21.770 --> 00:48:23.070
And we'll have the
microphones coming

00:48:23.070 --> 00:48:26.570 position:56%
around just here to facilitate this.

00:48:26.570 --> 00:48:27.870
Okay.

00:48:27.870 --> 00:48:29.680
&gt;&gt; I just wanted to thank --

00:48:29.680 --> 00:48:35.110
everyone of your statements has
been just so incredibly meaningful.

00:48:35.110 --> 00:48:36.710
I wanted to thank you all.

00:48:36.710 --> 00:48:38.010
&gt;&gt; Margaret Lioi: Thank you.

00:48:38.010 --> 00:48:40.820
&gt;&gt; And as I was listening to
each one of you, for example,

00:48:40.820 --> 00:48:45.340
I went through school,
high school, college

00:48:45.340 --> 00:48:48.700
and graduate school never
having a single women professor

00:48:48.700 --> 00:48:52.550
in chemistry, in the
sciences, at all.

00:48:52.550 --> 00:48:56.580
And so the parallels
between music and science

00:48:56.580 --> 00:49:00.890
in our career times is identical.

00:49:00.890 --> 00:49:06.330
And I applaud the Creativity
Connects, because I have to say

00:49:06.330 --> 00:49:12.350
that most of the women scientists
I know also play an instrument,

00:49:12.350 --> 00:49:13.730
and that's almost, you know,

00:49:13.730 --> 00:49:18.550
an absolutely necessary
therapeutic counterbalance

00:49:18.550 --> 00:49:22.560
to that solitary scientific
endeavor.

00:49:22.560 --> 00:49:27.520
And so I wanted to ask, though,
for example, the media lab at MIT,

00:49:27.520 --> 00:49:29.520
which I happen to know
very well, has --

00:49:29.520 --> 00:49:31.910
you know, the media is [inaudible].

00:49:31.910 --> 00:49:37.520
And so the arts and the sciences
have intertwined over the years,

00:49:37.520 --> 00:49:39.950 position:56%
not necessarily with women involved.

00:49:39.950 --> 00:49:45.500
But I guess I'm interested
in your perspective

00:49:45.500 --> 00:49:49.370
on the historical connection
and how that feeds into some

00:49:49.370 --> 00:49:58.950
of the connectivities of -- and
perhaps if you have some experience

00:49:58.950 --> 00:50:03.600
through your own musical education,
you mentioned at Mount Holyoake.

00:50:03.600 --> 00:50:07.270
You're obviously dealing with
cellists who are majoring

00:50:07.270 --> 00:50:12.010
in non-music, if you have
any comments on that as well.

00:50:12.010 --> 00:50:13.310
&gt;&gt; Astrid Schween: Yeah, sure.

00:50:13.310 --> 00:50:16.720
Well, that's one of the reasons I
enjoy my position at Mount Holyoake

00:50:16.720 --> 00:50:19.140 position:56%
so much -- it's just a little short.

00:50:19.140 --> 00:50:20.510
There we go.

00:50:20.510 --> 00:50:24.690
I do, as I said, work with so many
young women who are, you know,

00:50:24.690 --> 00:50:31.290 position:56%
likely future chairman's of major --
chairpersons of major corporations

00:50:31.290 --> 00:50:34.330
or possibly even future presidents.

00:50:34.330 --> 00:50:39.040
They're so bright and so
ambitious, and so creative.

00:50:39.040 --> 00:50:43.150
And when they take the time to
come for a weekly cello lesson

00:50:43.150 --> 00:50:46.200
or a chamber music session, I find
it's a great opportunity for us

00:50:46.200 --> 00:50:50.200
to connect on this, especially
in the level of communication.

00:50:50.200 --> 00:50:54.420
And how does one find
a voice and amplify

00:50:54.420 --> 00:50:57.120
that through the texture
of the group.

00:50:57.120 --> 00:51:01.040
Specifically you talked about
media and how that interacts

00:51:01.040 --> 00:51:02.650
with -- intersects with music.

00:51:02.650 --> 00:51:05.070
I think -- you know, I was
listing several classes

00:51:05.070 --> 00:51:07.670
that Juilliard has offered,
and I have to say as somebody

00:51:07.670 --> 00:51:10.490
who is stepping in, I
grew up at that school,

00:51:10.490 --> 00:51:15.150 position:56%
I was there from age seven to 20, so
I do feel like there's a little bit

00:51:15.150 --> 00:51:18.300
of my blood on the walls
everywhere [laughter].

00:51:18.300 --> 00:51:21.280
And I'm just so impressed now
coming back as a professor

00:51:21.280 --> 00:51:25.790
to see the innovations that have
been made by President Polisi

00:51:25.790 --> 00:51:28.200
and that he's addressing
this very issue.

00:51:28.200 --> 00:51:32.670
That it's not enough to be
creative within your own Scarlatti

00:51:32.670 --> 00:51:35.130
or [inaudible], but you
have to create a world

00:51:35.130 --> 00:51:36.540
in which you can share this music.

00:51:36.540 --> 00:51:41.390
And I think it's no accident that
classical music became so kind

00:51:41.390 --> 00:51:43.050
of single minded for a while,

00:51:43.050 --> 00:51:47.120
and was not successful
at being all inclusive.

00:51:47.120 --> 00:51:50.470
So in a way, to have
our young people now

00:51:50.470 --> 00:51:52.550
who are students use the media.

00:51:52.550 --> 00:51:56.390
They're using social media, they're
doing all sorts of things to get --

00:51:56.390 --> 00:52:00.590
to connect young people and
introduce them to classical music.

00:52:00.590 --> 00:52:02.350
I think it's fantastic.

00:52:02.350 --> 00:52:04.080
Exposure is everything.

00:52:04.080 --> 00:52:06.050
It's the reason I play the cello,

00:52:06.050 --> 00:52:11.350
and I imagine my colleagues here
had some similar experiences.

00:52:13.490 --> 00:52:18.290
&gt;&gt; Hi. Very much appreciate
all that you all are doing.

00:52:18.290 --> 00:52:21.670
Thank you very much for all
your dedication and commitment,

00:52:21.670 --> 00:52:25.580
because I know it must have been
mammoth over all these years.

00:52:25.580 --> 00:52:29.490
And I would just like to give a
little shout out to the composers.

00:52:29.490 --> 00:52:30.790
&gt;&gt; Jane Chu: Yeah.

00:52:30.790 --> 00:52:37.070
&gt;&gt; It seems like still that's a
section that is missing somehow.

00:52:37.070 --> 00:52:41.880
I think of the commissions done
here by the Library of Congress,

00:52:41.880 --> 00:52:46.040
and I wonder how many
have been won by women.

00:52:46.040 --> 00:52:51.610
When they were talking about
their panel several months ago,

00:52:51.610 --> 00:52:57.300
and picking people, I said,
do you do an anonymous

00:52:57.300 --> 00:52:59.420
or do you do it some other way.

00:52:59.420 --> 00:53:02.500
And they said, "No, we
know who we're seating."

00:53:02.500 --> 00:53:08.590
And I just wonder if some blind
competitions might be better

00:53:08.590 --> 00:53:15.790 position:56%
to give women a chance that perhaps
unconsciously the men may not be as,

00:53:15.790 --> 00:53:19.020
you know, accepting of.

00:53:19.020 --> 00:53:25.540
But also in general, I can't think
of a single woman composer or note,

00:53:25.540 --> 00:53:27.880
except in the popular field.

00:53:27.880 --> 00:53:35.200
Meredith Monk, Carol --
what's her name, Carol King.

00:53:35.200 --> 00:53:37.960
What's that?

00:53:37.960 --> 00:53:42.340
Carol Sager [assumed
spelling], just in popular field.

00:53:42.340 --> 00:53:45.580
I can't think -- I can't
think of a lot of --

00:53:45.580 --> 00:53:46.880
&gt;&gt; Annette McLean: I think

00:53:46.880 --> 00:53:48.180
of Jennifer Higdon [assumed
spelling] and [inaudible].

00:53:48.180 --> 00:53:49.480
We're so pleased to say that --

00:53:49.480 --> 00:53:53.390
&gt;&gt; Okay. Except [inaudible]
back in the 16th Century.

00:53:53.390 --> 00:53:58.650
So I'm just hoping that all of you
all who are on panels are watching

00:53:58.650 --> 00:54:01.280
out for the women who are
trying to get into that.

00:54:01.280 --> 00:54:02.580
&gt;&gt; Annette McLean: I know

00:54:02.580 --> 00:54:04.510
that Chamber Music America is
very, very much aware of this.

00:54:04.510 --> 00:54:06.390
And, Margaret, we've
talked about this

00:54:06.390 --> 00:54:10.420
about how gender blind listening
is important, and how you encourage

00:54:10.420 --> 00:54:12.960
and seek out submissions for women.

00:54:12.960 --> 00:54:15.710
And I can respond briefly on
behalf of the Library saying

00:54:15.710 --> 00:54:18.060
that we are very excited
that we do have a number

00:54:18.060 --> 00:54:21.010 position:56%
of important substantive commissions

00:54:21.010 --> 00:54:23.200
by female composers
in the last few years.

00:54:23.200 --> 00:54:25.000
And we have a couple
more coming up this year.

00:54:25.000 --> 00:54:26.850
If you look at our
brochure we are going

00:54:26.850 --> 00:54:30.210
to have Gabriella Alana
Fronk [assumed spelling],

00:54:30.210 --> 00:54:33.570
a new [inaudible] from
her [inaudible] Society.

00:54:33.570 --> 00:54:35.410 position:56%
But talk a little bit about -- yeah.

00:54:35.410 --> 00:54:37.210
This is --

00:54:37.210 --> 00:54:42.070
[ Inaudible Speaker ]

00:54:42.070 --> 00:54:43.890
Or we can swap microphones
for a second.

00:54:43.890 --> 00:54:45.910
&gt;&gt; Jane Chu: There you go.

00:54:45.910 --> 00:54:47.730
Go ahead.

00:54:47.730 --> 00:54:49.270
&gt;&gt; Margaret Lioi: Thank you.

00:54:49.270 --> 00:54:54.650
Yes, actually Caroline Shaw just
won the Pulitzer Prize last year

00:54:54.650 --> 00:54:55.950
for music.

00:54:55.950 --> 00:54:57.250
I think it was last year.

00:54:57.250 --> 00:55:02.660
And we have many, many --
actually Chamber Music America has

00:55:02.660 --> 00:55:05.290
commissioned many women composers.

00:55:05.290 --> 00:55:11.110
But you are absolutely right, they
are not as prominently programmed

00:55:11.110 --> 00:55:15.140
as male composers on
chamber music programs.

00:55:15.140 --> 00:55:18.330
I can only speak for chamber music.

00:55:18.330 --> 00:55:22.980
But we do an awful lot of outreach.

00:55:22.980 --> 00:55:29.860 position:56%
When we are having our commissioning
program we contact the women

00:55:29.860 --> 00:55:35.430
who have received commissions by
us, and ask them to, you know,

00:55:35.430 --> 00:55:39.660
spread the word so that
more women will apply.

00:55:39.660 --> 00:55:43.360
We've also -- we have a conference
every years, and we have had many,

00:55:43.360 --> 00:55:48.250
many sessions on programming
compositions by women.

00:55:48.250 --> 00:55:54.410
It's a an issue in the
classical musical field,

00:55:54.410 --> 00:55:57.630
it is even a bigger
issue in the jazz field.

00:55:57.630 --> 00:56:01.270
There are so few women
jazz musicians

00:56:01.270 --> 00:56:08.090 position:56%
and women jazz band leaders, and I
think this is just part of the field

00:56:08.090 --> 00:56:11.930
that has to be brought
up to the same level

00:56:11.930 --> 00:56:14.330
as the performing parts
of the field.

00:56:14.330 --> 00:56:18.480
And to do it I think we
have to be very intentional.

00:56:18.480 --> 00:56:22.530
There have to be some very
intentional steps taken

00:56:22.530 --> 00:56:27.230 position:56%
so that women have the opportunities
to compose and to be programmed.

00:56:27.230 --> 00:56:29.700
So thank you for bringing that up.

00:56:29.700 --> 00:56:31.720
&gt;&gt; Annette McLean: I
wanted to mention an article

00:56:31.720 --> 00:56:34.500
that you might find interesting,
unfortunately we're --

00:56:34.500 --> 00:56:36.760
I think we're almost out of time.

00:56:36.760 --> 00:56:40.570
But the Guardian actually has a
lot of coverage of these kinds

00:56:40.570 --> 00:56:42.870
of issues, the British newspaper.

00:56:42.870 --> 00:56:46.930
And there was an article very
recently how the male domination

00:56:46.930 --> 00:56:49.150
of classical music
may finally be coming

00:56:49.150 --> 00:56:51.430
to an end, which is interesting.

00:56:51.430 --> 00:56:53.640
But the article [inaudible] Jessica
Ducheon [assumed spelling] is the

00:56:53.640 --> 00:56:54.940
women who wrote the article.

00:56:54.940 --> 00:56:58.700
But what resonated in the back of
my mind about this was she talks

00:56:58.700 --> 00:57:02.470
about the BBC recently,
Radio 3, did long series

00:57:02.470 --> 00:57:05.540
of radio programs about
women composers.

00:57:05.540 --> 00:57:09.700
And recently there was
a British music exam

00:57:09.700 --> 00:57:12.030
on which almost no
composers were women,

00:57:12.030 --> 00:57:15.090
or maybe only one was on the exam.

00:57:15.090 --> 00:57:16.870
So this is a very timely issue.

00:57:16.870 --> 00:57:19.170
But the great news is
that there is a lot

00:57:19.170 --> 00:57:23.310
of very exciting things happening
and going on in this area.

00:57:23.310 --> 00:57:27.370
So maybe just one more question,
then we need to go to the concert.

00:57:28.610 --> 00:57:31.960
&gt;&gt; Good evening everyone, I'm
Kristy Wagner [assumed spelling],

00:57:31.960 --> 00:57:35.250
Starlee Wagner is my pen name,
Starlee is my stage name.

00:57:35.250 --> 00:57:39.910 position:56%
I'd like to know what can be done
politically, men and women together,

00:57:39.910 --> 00:57:44.110
to bring about the creation of
a Cabinet secretary of culture.

00:57:44.110 --> 00:57:48.570
Hungary, since time in [inaudible]
has had a Minister of Culture.

00:57:48.570 --> 00:57:51.580
France has had, Greece has had.

00:57:51.580 --> 00:57:54.590
It's indefensible that we do not.

00:57:55.630 --> 00:58:00.290
&gt;&gt; Jane Chu: Why are
you looking at me?

00:58:00.290 --> 00:58:03.210
&gt;&gt; Margaret Lioi: Well - oh, here.

00:58:03.210 --> 00:58:05.860 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Annette McLean: I think just I'll
start out by just referring again

00:58:05.860 --> 00:58:09.610
to the wonderful comment that
we were talking about earlier,

00:58:09.610 --> 00:58:13.340
Mrs. Coolidge said, we have
a secretary of hygiene,

00:58:13.340 --> 00:58:15.810
one of education, and
one of welfare,

00:58:15.810 --> 00:58:18.360
but we do not have a
secretary of fine arts.

00:58:18.360 --> 00:58:21.970
In fact, to have Jane
Chu is pretty amazing.

00:58:21.970 --> 00:58:23.460
You're right that we
need to move forward,

00:58:23.460 --> 00:58:25.520
and I'll let you speak to that.

00:58:25.520 --> 00:58:32.920
&gt;&gt; Margaret Lioi: Well, I -- that's
actually a very controversial idea,

00:58:32.920 --> 00:58:38.140
and there are many, many people
who are not in favor of it.

00:58:38.140 --> 00:58:45.810 position:56%
Not because -- because when you have
a cultural minister that also leads

00:58:45.810 --> 00:58:49.590
to other kinds of issues
that we don't have to deal

00:58:49.590 --> 00:58:51.440
with here in the United States.

00:58:51.440 --> 00:58:53.620
I think that actually the --

00:58:53.620 --> 00:59:01.060
having an agency the way
that we do is actually --

00:59:01.060 --> 00:59:05.120
I think some of the European
countries look to the United States

00:59:05.120 --> 00:59:11.960
to see how robust our philanthropy
is, which is based a great deal

00:59:11.960 --> 00:59:14.220
on the presence of the
National Endowment,

00:59:14.220 --> 00:59:18.780
and how it's grants leverage
money from the private sector.

00:59:18.780 --> 00:59:23.050 position:56%
That doesn't happen in the same way
when you have a Minister of Culture.

00:59:23.050 --> 00:59:25.780
So I understand people's --

00:59:25.780 --> 00:59:30.460
the impetus of we need somebody
there that's just for culture,

00:59:30.460 --> 00:59:34.980
but there are other
consequences of having that system

00:59:34.980 --> 00:59:36.690
that we don't have in this country.

00:59:36.690 --> 00:59:39.650
And so I'm not so much
in favor of --

00:59:39.650 --> 00:59:44.220 position:56%
I'm in favor of Jane Chu [laughter].

00:59:44.220 --> 00:59:46.090
I think she should do it.

00:59:46.090 --> 00:59:49.320
&gt;&gt; Annette McLean: I think
that we are out of time.

00:59:49.320 --> 00:59:50.890 position:56%
We very much appreciate your coming.

00:59:50.890 --> 00:59:54.510
We thank you, Chairman Chu,
Margaret Lioi, Astrid Schween.

00:59:54.510 --> 00:59:57.060
[ Applause ]

00:59:57.060 --> 00:59:59.940
&gt;&gt; This has been a presentation
of the Library of Congress.
