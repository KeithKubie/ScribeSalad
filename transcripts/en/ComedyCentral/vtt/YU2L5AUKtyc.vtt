00:00:09.443 --> 00:00:11.812
All right, well.

00:00:11.912 --> 00:00:12.980
Bye.

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:14.147
Bye.

00:00:33.267 --> 00:00:34.301
Whew.

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:39.206
Here's the craziest
thing about last night.

00:00:39.373 --> 00:00:41.208
Like his body just--

00:00:41.341 --> 00:00:42.743
It felt like home.

00:00:42.876 --> 00:00:44.378
Dude, does this taste
skunked to you ?

00:00:44.511 --> 00:00:45.812
No.

00:00:45.946 --> 00:00:46.780
What does he do ?

00:00:46.947 --> 00:00:48.148
Okay, we did
not get to that,

00:00:48.315 --> 00:00:51.952
but according to Google,
like finance, maybe.

00:00:52.119 --> 00:00:53.520
What'd you get into
last night ?

00:00:53.687 --> 00:00:56.190
Nothing.

00:00:56.356 --> 00:00:57.891
Actually, I got kind
of hammered.

00:00:58.025 --> 00:00:59.259
God, I like,
miss him.

00:00:59.426 --> 00:01:00.260
I'm gonna text him.

00:01:00.427 --> 00:01:01.495
Oh,
you should wait.

00:01:01.595 --> 00:01:06.533
No, the amazing thing
is that we're not playing games.

00:01:06.633 --> 00:01:08.068
Oh my God.
( phone alert )

00:01:13.807 --> 00:01:14.842
No idea who
that is.

00:01:18.579 --> 00:01:20.681
How hard is it to open
a joint checking account ?

00:01:20.814 --> 00:01:23.183
And this is for you
and your husband ?

00:01:23.283 --> 00:01:25.252
Husband ?

00:01:25.385 --> 00:01:28.388
I--
I guess, I guess.

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:40.334
I have a feeling.

00:01:47.841 --> 00:01:49.776
Mm-hmm.

00:01:49.877 --> 00:01:51.879
This is it.

00:01:52.012 --> 00:01:53.413
This is my
wedding cake.

00:01:58.752 --> 00:02:01.722
This place
is perfect.

00:02:01.855 --> 00:02:04.825
Unless he's Jewish.

00:02:04.925 --> 00:02:06.159
Whatever, it's my day,
right ?

00:02:07.928 --> 00:02:08.962
You know what ?

00:02:09.062 --> 00:02:10.797
There's one more thing
I'd like to take a look at.

00:02:14.902 --> 00:02:15.736
You know what ?

00:02:15.903 --> 00:02:16.904
I just--
I feel it.

00:02:16.937 --> 00:02:19.973
I feel like Matt and I will
just be at peace here.

00:02:20.107 --> 00:02:20.974
Yeah.

00:02:21.141 --> 00:02:22.075
God.

00:02:22.142 --> 00:02:23.076
You know what ?

00:02:23.143 --> 00:02:26.813
I'm gonna call my boo-boo,
see what he's up to.

00:02:26.947 --> 00:02:29.716
( phone ringing )

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:30.717
Hello ?

00:02:30.884 --> 00:02:31.919
Hey.

00:02:32.085 --> 00:02:34.254
Just at the cemetery,
thinking boutcha.

00:02:34.388 --> 00:02:35.389
What are you thinking
for tonight ?

00:02:35.522 --> 00:02:38.525
I'm literally
down for whatever.

00:02:38.625 --> 00:02:40.627
Who is this ?

00:02:40.761 --> 00:02:43.096
Uh, it's Amy.

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:46.633
We--we hung out last night,
I came back to your place.

00:02:46.767 --> 00:02:49.503
Right, yeah.

00:02:49.636 --> 00:02:51.805
Sorry, I think
I'm gonna take a pass

00:02:51.905 --> 00:02:54.341
on us seeing each
other again.

00:02:54.441 --> 00:02:55.809
Did I wear a bag ?

00:02:58.111 --> 00:03:00.480
What a dick !

00:03:00.614 --> 00:03:02.182
Ma'am, should
I stop digging ?

00:03:02.349 --> 00:03:03.350
Yeah.

00:03:05.419 --> 00:03:07.120
Wait.

00:03:07.254 --> 00:03:08.488
What's your name ?

00:03:08.622 --> 00:03:09.623
My name's Charles.

00:03:12.192 --> 00:03:15.062
Amy Charles.

00:03:15.128 --> 00:03:17.564
Keep digging.
