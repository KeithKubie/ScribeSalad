00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:04.760
So I'm approaching and I bind the sequence tens of thousand of letters away.

00:00:04.760 --> 00:00:08.590
&gt;&gt; And even though she's that far away from the start of the gene,

00:00:08.590 --> 00:00:12.810
it's okay, because DNA can fold as we saw just a second ago, and now,

00:00:12.810 --> 00:00:16.097
her sequence is actually really close to the beginning of the gene or the

00:00:16.097 --> 00:00:18.450
TATA-box region here. So if I'm a

00:00:18.450 --> 00:00:21.230
protein that promotes transcription, what am I called?

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:23.910
&gt;&gt; Well, a sequence that promotes transcription

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:25.880
here at this site would be called

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:29.090
an enhancer. Now, not all sequences have to promote

00:00:29.090 --> 00:00:32.570
transcription. Some of them inhibit transcription, and we call

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:37.770
those sequences silencers. Now, If we know that the

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:40.460
effect of an enhancer or a silencer is because

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:42.150
of whether or not the protein is bound or

00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:43.850
not. I want you to look at the following

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:48.460
scenarios, and tell me which scenario matches with which

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:51.220
level of transcription. This could be a little tricky.

00:00:51.220 --> 00:00:53.470
So focus on each picture, and see if you can

00:00:53.470 --> 00:00:56.860
match which ones belong to each other. Match the scenario

00:00:56.860 --> 00:00:59.740
on the left with the amount of transcription expected on

00:00:59.740 --> 00:01:02.830
the right. There are three scenarios here on the left,

00:01:02.830 --> 00:01:04.840
three scenarios on the right. The ones on the right

00:01:04.840 --> 00:01:07.490
are lettered A, B and C. Just put the letter

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:10.810
in the box that corresponds to the situation on the

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:13.770
left, where you'd expect that situation to be a match.
