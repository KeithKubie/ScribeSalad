00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
Being alive today, you probably know that lightening is a form of electricity.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000
But this wasn't obvious in the 18th century.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:11.000
If you were this green-haired person here watching houses get struck by lightening,

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.000
you'd probably think, "What is this thing?"

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000
Let's go back to the professor to get some more context on this situation.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:21.000
[Professor Lucio Fregonese, University of Pavia] Before the explosion of electrical studies

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:29.000
in the 18th century, lightening was interpreted as an explosion of sulfur, sulfurous matter

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000
coming from the earth.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:36.000
But people started to realize some analogies between lightening and electricity.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:41.000
Benjamin Franklin was not the first to think about that analogy.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.000
It was already present in science.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:49.000
For example, a French scientist wrote down a list of analogies

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:53.000
between lightening and artificial electricity,

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:57.000
but it was Benjamin Franklin to stress the analogy.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:06.000
One of the most evident effects you'll see studying electricity are attraction and repulsion.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:11.000
So, there are interactions between electrified bodies.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:14.000
There is a quantity called electrical charge,

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:19.000
which is one of the quantities involved in the phenomenon.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:25.000
The bigger the charge, the stronger the effect in the same conditions.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:29.000
The analogy with gravity is very clarifying.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.000
It looks like we have our work cut out for us,

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.000
but with the help of Benjamin Franklin,

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:37.000
it looks like we may be able to answer this question--what is lightening?

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:42.000
And we might even be able to prevent it from hitting our churches, houses and other buildings.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.000
Now, if you've ever rubbed your feet on the carpet

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.000
and then touched your finger to your friends,

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.000
you might have noticed a little spark.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.000
That spark is electricity.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:56.000
It was Franklin's idea that this spark was the same as this giant spark in the sky

00:01:56.000 --> 99:59:59.000
and that both were a form of electricity.
