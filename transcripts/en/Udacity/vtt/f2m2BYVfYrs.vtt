00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.240
Now, of course, this overview is super subjective and far from complete

00:00:04.240 --> 00:00:08.010
and also maybe not always correct but nevertheless.

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:12.460
I think clustering or finding groups of related objects, usually it's a good idea

00:00:12.460 --> 00:00:14.490
to try to do a reduction from clique.

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:17.650
Covering a set of objects--that is basically the problem that Alice was looking at

00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:19.840
for her Telecommunications Company.

00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:24.300
Vertex cover is usually a good idea and there are certain generalizations of vertex cover

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:30.440
called hitting set that can also be a useful tool in proving that problems like these are NP complete.

00:00:30.440 --> 00:00:35.950
Optimizing pathways--well, yeah that is shortest tour and also here you should know that

00:00:35.950 --> 00:00:41.430
shortest tour has a very closely-related problem and that is the famous traveling salesman problem.

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:43.800
They are not the same but they are very, very close.

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:48.040
Traveling salesman is basically shortest tour, but you cannot visit a vertex more than once,

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:52.990
so it's enforced here, and traveling salesman or the shortest tour problem here,

00:00:52.990 --> 00:00:57.040
it is always a good idea to try to use these problems for a reduction when you want

00:00:57.040 --> 00:01:02.440
to show that a problem that deals with optimizing pathways under constraints is NP complete.

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:07.670
Now, diversification/independent objects--yeah. If you're a bit test savvy, you would already have guessed.

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:11.860
This is, of course, independent set, and then, finally, something else.

00:01:11.860 --> 99:59:59.000
Well, you use our general tool and that is SAT.
