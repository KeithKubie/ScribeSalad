1
00:00:01.980 --> 00:00:03.180
Okay,
let's get started.

2
00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:08.990
The stuff we're doing these few days are really the focus of the first half of

3
00:00:09.091 --> 00:00:13.950
the semester,
so pay attention and uh,
think about it.

4
00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:17.250
Um,
okay,

5
00:00:17.251 --> 00:00:22.251
so the topics today are overlap and energy match as determinants of how strong

6
00:00:23.641 --> 00:00:27.330
bonds are.
So we'll start with overlap.

7
00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:33.080
We saw last time that overlap is what creates the difference density,

8
00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:38.390
what focuses some small amount of the electron density between the atoms and

9
00:00:39.181 --> 00:00:40.740
serves to hold them together.

10
00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:46.520
The overlap integral is the total amount of that product of a and B.

11
00:00:47.671 --> 00:00:52.671
Remember you square a plus B and you got a squared plus B squared plus two ab

12
00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:56.130
that to a B term is the overlap.

13
00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:59.130
It's called overlap because it has values.

14
00:00:59.131 --> 00:01:04.131
When both functions have appreciable magnitude at the same point in space,

15
00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:05.333
they overlap.

16
00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:10.790
And summing that overall space or integrating it gives what's called the overlap

17
00:01:10.981 --> 00:01:15.450
integral.
It'll depend on the distance.
Obviously they're very far apart.

18
00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:20.040
They don't give simultaneous values to the same point in space because it's far

19
00:01:20.041 --> 00:01:24.840
from either one or the other or from both.
So it depends on distance.

20
00:01:25.410 --> 00:01:30.150
It also depends on hybridization and that's what we're going to talk about
first.

21
00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:33.750
Okay?
First,
let's just look for scale.

22
00:01:33.751 --> 00:01:38.751
Here are the two s orbitals of carbon atom and you can work out with your

23
00:01:38.971 --> 00:01:40.930
formulas that the,

24
00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:45.540
the diameter of the spherical node is 0.7 OnX drums,

25
00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:51.210
right?
That means we have a distance scale here.
Now,

26
00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:53.480
the distance between two car,
uh,

27
00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:58.680
carbons is roughly 1.4,
1.5,
uh,

28
00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:03.150
when they formed a bond from one another between one another.
Okay?

29
00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:08.040
So that means we can use that 0.7 angst from scale to see how far we have to

30
00:02:08.041 --> 00:02:11.820
slide these together in order to get them to bonded distance.

31
00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:15.870
If we superimpose the x's,
remember those diameters are each 0.7.

32
00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:20.220
So if we slide them together until we superimpose the x's,

33
00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:22.680
then there are 1.4 angst comes apart.

34
00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:29.460
So that's about the distance that these two orbitals are and the proper scale

35
00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:32.760
when they're in a carbon carbon bond.
Now,

36
00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:38.990
how big is the overlap integral to some of the product of a Times B overall

37
00:02:41.551 --> 00:02:44.070
space?
Now I want you to guess,

38
00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:47.670
guess how big that integral is,
and we have a hint.

39
00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:53.390
What would the overlap integral be if we moved them until they superimposed on

40
00:02:54.121 --> 00:02:55.500
one another?
Exactly.

41
00:02:56.820 --> 00:02:59.890
That's the maximum we could get if the distance where zero.

42
00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:01.930
So if we pulled them all together,

43
00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:04.780
then a and B would be measured from the same center,

44
00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:08.890
so it'd be the same thing as a squared.
Okay,

45
00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:14.700
so what would the integral of a squared B overall space one.

46
00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:17.950
That's normalization.
Okay,

47
00:03:17.951 --> 00:03:21.430
so the maximum value can get when they're right on top of one another.

48
00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:26.640
Negatives multiplied negatives to give positive positive areas multiply positive

49
00:03:27.131 --> 00:03:30.910
areas to give positive everything is optimum is going to be one.

50
00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:33.940
Now I want somebody to give me an idea,

51
00:03:33.941 --> 00:03:36.580
a guess of how big it's going to be here,

52
00:03:36.581 --> 00:03:39.160
or at least some considerations that would go into that.

53
00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:43.690
The maximum value you can get is one.
How big do you think it would be here?

54
00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:46.240
What's something that would hurt it

55
00:03:49.130 --> 00:03:51.060
that is making it less than one Russell?

56
00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:52.723
<v 1>Yes.</v>

57
00:03:54.190 --> 00:03:57.760
<v 0>Yeah.
On the f beyond out,
beyond the red areas,</v>

58
00:03:57.761 --> 00:03:59.490
there's very little overlap altogether.

59
00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:04.420
So you lose whatever overlap you'd get from there and doing the normalization.

60
00:04:05.320 --> 00:04:09.400
Now in the middle,
right in the middle,
you have blue on top of blue.
That's good.

61
00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:14.740
But notice there's also a node that's going to interfere with some of the wave

62
00:04:14.741 --> 00:04:19.090
functions overlapping and there's going to be a little bit of blue on top of
red.

63
00:04:19.930 --> 00:04:24.760
Everybody got that?
So I just want uh,
people to guess.
Okay.

64
00:04:24.761 --> 00:04:28.750
I know what I'll do.
We'll,
we'll do a poll.
This is a democracy after all.

65
00:04:28.751 --> 00:04:30.340
We're about to get it to November.

66
00:04:30.670 --> 00:04:34.960
So I'm going to start with 0.1 as what you think it would be right?

67
00:04:34.961 --> 00:04:37.600
The maximum if you put them right on top of one another is one.

68
00:04:38.140 --> 00:04:40.780
So I'm going to start with 0.1 and move up and see hands.
Okay.

69
00:04:40.781 --> 00:04:43.960
How many people think it's 0.1 0.2

70
00:04:45.730 --> 00:04:50.730
0.3 0.4 0.5

71
00:04:52.930 --> 00:04:57.930
0.67891.

72
00:04:57.941 --> 00:05:01.930
Obviously not one.
Now I think [inaudible] has been my uh,

73
00:05:02.230 --> 00:05:05.860
sense of this is it peaked between 0.3 and 0.4.

74
00:05:05.861 --> 00:05:09.670
But there were some votes for 0.2 and I would have voted for 0.2 cause it looks

75
00:05:09.671 --> 00:05:12.580
like you've lost an awful lot here.
But in fact,

76
00:05:12.581 --> 00:05:15.250
I personally am surprised that it's pretty big.

77
00:05:15.400 --> 00:05:20.400
It's 0.41 it's almost half as big as it would be if they were right on top of

78
00:05:21.191 --> 00:05:25.240
one another despite despite the fact that you're losing great parts of it that

79
00:05:25.241 --> 00:05:26.530
they don't overlap at all.

80
00:05:26.710 --> 00:05:29.380
And there's negative overlap where reds on top of blue,

81
00:05:29.381 --> 00:05:32.410
because still the fact is it's 0.41 so pretty big.

82
00:05:32.770 --> 00:05:36.190
Now that's going to depend on distance obviously.
Right?

83
00:05:36.191 --> 00:05:38.080
So here's how it depends on distance.

84
00:05:38.081 --> 00:05:41.310
There's that point at 1.4 on strums.

85
00:05:41.380 --> 00:05:46.360
It's 0.41 and I've put on here for reference the distance of a carbon carbon

86
00:05:46.361 --> 00:05:47.194
single bond,

87
00:05:47.470 --> 00:05:51.940
the distance of a carbon carbon double bond and a carbon carbon triple bond and

88
00:05:51.941 --> 00:05:56.800
zero notice would be way down out in the hallway someplace,

89
00:05:56.990 --> 00:05:57.230
right?

90
00:05:57.230 --> 00:06:01.940
We're only looking at the region that's carbon carbon bonds or maybe just about

91
00:06:01.941 --> 00:06:06.480
to the far wall.
Okay,
here's,
here's half an obstacle.

92
00:06:06.481 --> 00:06:11.260
We got to go two more halves.
Right.
Okay.
So here's how it,

93
00:06:11.300 --> 00:06:15.950
how do you think,
what should the line look like?
Should it be a sign wave?

94
00:06:16.580 --> 00:06:19.430
Should it be increasing as we go to the left?

95
00:06:19.431 --> 00:06:21.740
Should it be decreasing as we go to the left?
What do you think

96
00:06:26.790 --> 00:06:30.330
some guests
should probably decrease?

97
00:06:30.360 --> 00:06:34.950
Cause cause we know it's going to approach one,
right?
And there it is.
Yes,

98
00:06:34.951 --> 00:06:36.330
it decreases it.
Pardon me?

99
00:06:36.331 --> 00:06:40.470
It increases as you go to the left and ultimately it'll go up to one when you

100
00:06:40.471 --> 00:06:44.730
get out to the hallway.
Okay,
so that's s with us.

101
00:06:44.940 --> 00:06:48.980
Now let's look at some other orbitals that might overlap and see how big their

102
00:06:48.981 --> 00:06:51.210
overlap Benadryls would be.
Okay.

103
00:06:51.211 --> 00:06:56.211
Suppose you have s on one overlapping with p on the other.

104
00:06:56.730 --> 00:06:59.610
Now that p is called for this purpose,

105
00:06:59.670 --> 00:07:04.670
Pi Pi is the Greek version of p.

106
00:07:05.670 --> 00:07:10.080
In fact,
in Greek you pronounce it p not pie.
Right?

107
00:07:10.081 --> 00:07:13.380
So that's the Greek letter p.
Am I right about that?

108
00:07:16.610 --> 00:07:18.350
Okay.
What is it?
Which way is it?

109
00:07:22.940 --> 00:07:26.880
Uh Huh.
Okay,
good.
So anyhow,
Pi now,

110
00:07:27.480 --> 00:07:29.430
uh,
so that,

111
00:07:29.460 --> 00:07:34.460
that symbol is used to talk about molecular orbitals or parts of molecular

112
00:07:35.251 --> 00:07:39.090
orbitals where P is used to talk about atomic orbitals,

113
00:07:39.091 --> 00:07:40.620
they correspond to one another.

114
00:07:40.800 --> 00:07:45.800
Now what is it that characterize as a p atomic orbital has a nodal plane.

115
00:07:47.190 --> 00:07:52.190
And in the same way a Pi orbital has a nodal plane that contains the nuclei that

116
00:07:54.211 --> 00:07:57.720
are in question,
right?
So you'll see if those two came together,

117
00:07:57.721 --> 00:08:01.230
there'd be a nodal plane in the orbital on the right that contains the two

118
00:08:01.231 --> 00:08:06.030
nuclei.
Okay?
So that's called a Pi orbital.
Okay?

119
00:08:06.480 --> 00:08:06.751
Now,

120
00:08:06.751 --> 00:08:11.751
but notice the contributions to the overlap below that plane,

121
00:08:12.300 --> 00:08:14.640
you're going to have blue overlapping with blue.

122
00:08:14.700 --> 00:08:16.920
So that's going to be a positive contribution.

123
00:08:17.070 --> 00:08:19.920
But above you're going to have blue overlapping with red.

124
00:08:20.130 --> 00:08:23.460
That's going to be a negative contribution and it's symmetrical.

125
00:08:24.270 --> 00:08:25.650
So what will the total B,

126
00:08:27.460 --> 00:08:31.180
what will the total overlap integral be?
The sum of all the overlaps?

127
00:08:33.280 --> 00:08:34.113
<v 1>One,</v>

128
00:08:34.890 --> 00:08:38.310
<v 0>it'll be zero because for every contribution on the bottom,
what's positive,</v>

129
00:08:38.311 --> 00:08:40.860
there'll be one on the top.
That's the same value in is negative.

130
00:08:41.160 --> 00:08:46.140
So it's going to be zero.
So the one on the left is called sigma.

131
00:08:46.920 --> 00:08:50.820
Now sigma is the Greek equivalent of s,
right?

132
00:08:50.821 --> 00:08:55.260
So it means for a molecular orbital what s meant for an atomic orbital,

133
00:08:55.261 --> 00:08:58.980
there are no nodes that contain the the nucleus.

134
00:08:59.820 --> 00:09:02.310
Okay?
Okay?

135
00:09:02.311 --> 00:09:05.250
So if you have a sigma overlapping with a pie,

136
00:09:05.550 --> 00:09:08.730
there's going to be this symmetry that causes a cancellation.

137
00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:14.000
So you can never get any overlap by overlapping a sigma orbital with a Pi

138
00:09:14.611 --> 00:09:19.190
orbital.
Does that make sense to everyone?
That does make sense.

139
00:09:19.191 --> 00:09:20.024
Doesn't make sense.

140
00:09:21.410 --> 00:09:25.250
If you have one that doesn't have a horizontal node that's the same top and

141
00:09:25.251 --> 00:09:26.000
bottom,

142
00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:29.960
and you one that has the one that does have a node that's plus on the top,

143
00:09:29.961 --> 00:09:30.950
minus on the bottom,

144
00:09:31.160 --> 00:09:34.490
then you're going to get this cancellation everywhere and zero.

145
00:09:34.520 --> 00:09:37.460
And that's called orthogonal.
Okay?

146
00:09:37.461 --> 00:09:41.840
So you won't get any net interaction.
They're okay.

147
00:09:41.841 --> 00:09:46.430
But if you turn the PR,
but also that it is also sigma notice,

148
00:09:46.431 --> 00:09:47.570
it has a plane,

149
00:09:48.220 --> 00:09:51.560
a nodal plane that contains that nucleus,

150
00:09:52.310 --> 00:09:55.880
but it doesn't contain the other nucleus you're interested in.

151
00:09:56.420 --> 00:09:58.430
So the the call sigma and Pi,

152
00:09:58.431 --> 00:10:03.200
we need a plane that contains both nuclei that'll create this symmetry that

153
00:10:03.201 --> 00:10:08.060
cancels things out.
Okay,
so this one will give overlap?

154
00:10:08.090 --> 00:10:08.270
No.

155
00:10:08.270 --> 00:10:12.830
What would you expect for the trend of this one as you go from great distance to

156
00:10:12.831 --> 00:10:15.740
small distance?
How about if they're very,
very far apart?
How much,

157
00:10:15.800 --> 00:10:20.690
how big will the overlap integral be?
Like 10 meters apart.
Zero.

158
00:10:20.990 --> 00:10:24.680
Okay.
Now as you bring it together,
will it start pot,

159
00:10:24.681 --> 00:10:28.250
will the or as they start coming together where you get positive or negative

160
00:10:28.251 --> 00:10:30.590
overlap.
Positive.
Right.

161
00:10:30.591 --> 00:10:33.710
The blue will overlap with the blue and you keep coming.

162
00:10:33.710 --> 00:10:36.980
It'll get bigger and bigger and then what will happen?

163
00:10:38.420 --> 00:10:41.780
Then the red is going to start coming in and uh,
well the,

164
00:10:41.781 --> 00:10:45.410
the blue is going to start the blue on the right from the puppy orbital to start

165
00:10:45.411 --> 00:10:46.460
going to overlap that,

166
00:10:46.490 --> 00:10:51.490
that the red part on the left and then as it slides on over till they,

167
00:10:52.460 --> 00:10:56.210
till they get exactly on top of one another when they get exactly on top of one

168
00:10:56.211 --> 00:11:00.620
another,
what will it be?
Zero.
Because there'll be canceling right to left.

169
00:11:01.010 --> 00:11:05.930
Okay,
so here's,
here's a plot of that for s p sigma overlap,

170
00:11:06.350 --> 00:11:09.710
right?
It's almost the same as s with us.
In fact,

171
00:11:10.040 --> 00:11:11.990
it's a little bigger at great distance,

172
00:11:11.991 --> 00:11:16.370
a little smaller at small distance except at very small distance.

173
00:11:16.371 --> 00:11:20.680
What will happen
when you approaches zero,

174
00:11:23.530 --> 00:11:27.050
it will go to zero,
whereas the other one went to one,
right?

175
00:11:27.051 --> 00:11:29.240
That's with us went to one.
So,

176
00:11:29.241 --> 00:11:33.620
but in the region we're interested in of the carbon carbon bond distances,

177
00:11:33.830 --> 00:11:38.720
it's about the same.
Okay.
Now how about peace sigma with p sigma?

178
00:11:41.530 --> 00:11:44.470
Well,
we won't go through elaborate guessing game.

179
00:11:44.471 --> 00:11:46.390
If they're very far apart it'll be zero.

180
00:11:46.810 --> 00:11:48.940
How about if they were on top of one another?

181
00:11:51.550 --> 00:11:55.810
It's obviously going to grow as blue on top of blue and then as they get really

182
00:11:55.811 --> 00:11:57.160
close,
the blew up from there,
right?

183
00:11:57.161 --> 00:12:01.780
We'll be on top of the red and the red on top of the blue.
Right.
And what will,

184
00:12:01.970 --> 00:12:05.920
what will it approach Zach,
what do you say?
Approaches zero.

185
00:12:07.150 --> 00:12:10.180
What will it be when they're right on top of one another?

186
00:12:12.010 --> 00:12:14.920
So read on blue here.
Blue on red here.

187
00:12:16.520 --> 00:12:17.890
Will they overlap be zero?

188
00:12:20.120 --> 00:12:20.953
<v 1>Pardon me?</v>

189
00:12:22.180 --> 00:12:27.180
<v 0>It will be minus one because it would be like the orbital on top of itself.</v>

190
00:12:27.370 --> 00:12:31.900
That would be one except you've changed the sign of one of them.
Right?

191
00:12:32.890 --> 00:12:34.750
So every contribution will be negative.

192
00:12:34.990 --> 00:12:39.340
So that one starts there and it's heading toward minus one.
So it's going down.

193
00:12:42.140 --> 00:12:44.360
Okay,
so that's p sigma with p sigma.

194
00:12:44.510 --> 00:12:46.490
Can you think of any other way we should talk about,

195
00:12:46.491 --> 00:12:47.900
we've talked about this with us.

196
00:12:48.350 --> 00:12:51.710
We saw that s with p pie was orthogonal.

197
00:12:52.010 --> 00:12:56.240
S with s with a s with a p sigma.

198
00:12:56.270 --> 00:13:00.800
We've got their p sigma with p sigma.
Any others?
We need to think about.

199
00:13:02.960 --> 00:13:06.050
How about p Sigma with PPI?

200
00:13:07.820 --> 00:13:09.020
Can anybody guess that one

201
00:13:13.690 --> 00:13:16.630
p sigma is the same sign,
top and bottom.

202
00:13:17.200 --> 00:13:19.810
P Pie is opposite sides.
Top and bottom.

203
00:13:22.070 --> 00:13:24.140
That's going to be zero.
There'll be orthogonal.

204
00:13:24.350 --> 00:13:26.450
So we've done it now or is there anything else to think about?

205
00:13:27.740 --> 00:13:30.410
We could do p Pie with p Pi.
Okay,

206
00:13:30.411 --> 00:13:34.670
so there's a p Pie with p Pie.
Okay.

207
00:13:35.330 --> 00:13:38.270
Now what?
At great distance,
there'll be nothing will bring them together.

208
00:13:38.271 --> 00:13:42.920
They'll begin to overlap.
What will let approach as we go to zero,
zero.

209
00:13:43.490 --> 00:13:48.020
If they're on top of one another,
the product to be zero,
it'll be one,
right?

210
00:13:48.021 --> 00:13:52.430
It'll be the orbital with itself normalized.
So that'll be one.

211
00:13:53.030 --> 00:13:53.810
Right?

212
00:13:53.810 --> 00:13:58.010
But now how do you think is going to be bigger p signal with peace sigma or PPI

213
00:13:58.190 --> 00:14:01.700
with p Pie.
And he guesses.

214
00:14:02.540 --> 00:14:05.090
I'll give you the answer,
right?

215
00:14:05.750 --> 00:14:09.410
P Pie with P [inaudible] is approaching one at big distance.

216
00:14:09.411 --> 00:14:13.580
It's smaller than sigma,
right?
But it's small distance start.

217
00:14:13.670 --> 00:14:18.590
It must get much bigger.
And in this region it's crossing,
so it's bigger.
Okay.

218
00:14:18.591 --> 00:14:23.120
So there are the,
the kinds of overlaps of simple two P orbitals.

219
00:14:24.350 --> 00:14:25.183
Uh,

220
00:14:26.480 --> 00:14:30.380
now there's a curiosity here over on most of this range,

221
00:14:30.381 --> 00:14:31.910
more than half of the range.

222
00:14:32.630 --> 00:14:37.630
Two s overlaps with two p sigma better than either two s with two s or two p

223
00:14:39.201 --> 00:14:42.740
sigma with two p sigma.
That just seems curious to me.

224
00:14:42.920 --> 00:14:47.660
You'd think that one of them would have a shape that gives better overlap.
Right?

225
00:14:48.050 --> 00:14:52.430
So two of those together would do the best job,
but it's not that way.

226
00:14:52.580 --> 00:14:56.210
It's that an s with a p is the best over most of this range.

227
00:14:57.800 --> 00:15:01.100
I just think that's curious and it has an important implication,

228
00:15:01.101 --> 00:15:02.540
which you'll see right now.

229
00:15:03.320 --> 00:15:07.820
What if we use hybrid orbitals that are partly yes and partly p.

230
00:15:08.180 --> 00:15:12.350
Now since this one is partly s,
it's s plus a certain amount of p,

231
00:15:12.530 --> 00:15:14.570
this one's asked with a certain amount of p.

232
00:15:14.750 --> 00:15:19.750
The overlap will be s here with s here as here with p here as here with p here

233
00:15:22.280 --> 00:15:24.500
and p here with p here,
right?

234
00:15:24.501 --> 00:15:29.501
There'll be four contributions to the s with us p with p s with p with us.

235
00:15:31.040 --> 00:15:34.520
Right?
So if we took the p Cube for example,

236
00:15:34.521 --> 00:15:38.800
and we can make you remember for such orbitals,
uh,

237
00:15:39.050 --> 00:15:41.840
then you get that it's better than,

238
00:15:42.110 --> 00:15:45.410
than any of the pure hybrids.
Right?

239
00:15:45.650 --> 00:15:50.650
And the reason is that it has that it has s with s and p with p and also s with

240
00:15:52.011 --> 00:15:56.660
p that comes in as a bonus.
Right?
Twice.

241
00:15:57.530 --> 00:16:00.860
Okay.
Now.
How about if we use instead of s p cubed?

242
00:16:01.040 --> 00:16:04.250
How about if we use SP squared?
Remember what happens is we,

243
00:16:04.520 --> 00:16:09.050
as we approach sp,
the orbitals extend more.

244
00:16:09.500 --> 00:16:13.460
So what do you expect?
More overlap.

245
00:16:15.170 --> 00:16:18.770
So there's SP squared with sp squared a little better.

246
00:16:18.800 --> 00:16:23.180
How about sp with sp
better still?

247
00:16:24.770 --> 00:16:29.000
Could we get any better?
How about s squared?

248
00:16:29.001 --> 00:16:33.740
P With s squared P or s p one half with sp one half,

249
00:16:34.280 --> 00:16:35.090
right.

250
00:16:35.090 --> 00:16:40.090
It's a little better at short distance at about and a little lots of good at

251
00:16:40.581 --> 00:16:41.271
long distance.

252
00:16:41.271 --> 00:16:46.271
So it optimizes around sp hybridization that gives the best overlap.

253
00:16:46.880 --> 00:16:49.670
Why do you want,
why do we think now you want good overlap?

254
00:16:50.150 --> 00:16:51.920
Why would it be good to have good overlap?

255
00:16:53.310 --> 00:16:57.620
Because that's what's building up the difference density as we saw last time.

256
00:16:57.621 --> 00:17:01.550
Right?
That's putting the glue in the,
in the orbital.
Okay.

257
00:17:01.551 --> 00:17:06.551
So there's an interesting observation here that hybrids overlap about twice as

258
00:17:07.431 --> 00:17:11.390
well as pure orbitals.
Right?

259
00:17:11.600 --> 00:17:16.040
All the hybrids are roughly twice as good as the,
as the pure ones.

260
00:17:16.990 --> 00:17:20.630
Okay.
And they're not very,
very different from one another.

261
00:17:21.020 --> 00:17:24.260
But sp is about the best over a bunch of this range.

262
00:17:24.980 --> 00:17:29.980
The trouble with sp is you can only make two of them because each involves 50%

263
00:17:30.711 --> 00:17:34.730
of acid.
You only have one s to go in it.
You have one s and three P's.

264
00:17:35.090 --> 00:17:40.090
So if you want to make just one orbital fine use sp cause it,

265
00:17:40.341 --> 00:17:44.300
you'll get good over.
Well only one,
uh,
bond from the carbon fine use,

266
00:17:44.330 --> 00:17:49.150
use sp and get the best overlap or maybe even s squared p right?

267
00:17:49.170 --> 00:17:53.310
Depending on the distance.
Right?
But if you want to make more bonds,

268
00:17:53.510 --> 00:17:55.080
if you want more than two bonds,

269
00:17:55.320 --> 00:17:58.140
then you're going to have to cut back on the s in each bond.

270
00:17:58.141 --> 00:17:59.850
Cause you only have 100% to use.

271
00:17:59.851 --> 00:18:04.851
You can't use more than 50% in more than two bonds you're making.

272
00:18:05.580 --> 00:18:10.500
Okay.
And what you see here is that s p three isn't much worse than sp squared.

273
00:18:10.560 --> 00:18:13.920
So why not make for right?
Cause you can,

274
00:18:15.300 --> 00:18:19.680
okay.
Anyhow,
that's the hybridisation of carbon.
So,

275
00:18:20.210 --> 00:18:22.140
and the reason they do this,
as I already said,

276
00:18:22.141 --> 00:18:27.141
is because they allowed nearly full measure of s with p overlap plus s with s

277
00:18:28.261 --> 00:18:30.540
and p with p when you have mixtures.

278
00:18:31.860 --> 00:18:36.810
So that all depends on the fact that sp sigma is so good and it's overlap

279
00:18:39.570 --> 00:18:39.841
now.

280
00:18:39.841 --> 00:18:44.841
So sp gives the best overlap but only allows two orbitals with 50% in each SB

281
00:18:45.470 --> 00:18:49.170
three gives four in nearly as much overlap.
Okay.

282
00:18:49.650 --> 00:18:54.060
Now we're going to look at the influence of overlap on molecular orbital energy.

283
00:18:54.270 --> 00:18:57.690
But we're gonna use Arab and meets goldilocks just for familiarity.

284
00:18:57.691 --> 00:19:01.560
So we're working here in just one dimension to get the idea of it.

285
00:19:01.770 --> 00:19:04.230
And we'll also then think in more general terms,

286
00:19:06.930 --> 00:19:09.960
and we've already done this,
so it's partly review.

287
00:19:11.190 --> 00:19:13.740
So we'll assume that there's perfect energy match.

288
00:19:13.741 --> 00:19:17.520
That is the two Adams were talking about.
Of course Adams would be cool.

289
00:19:17.521 --> 00:19:22.260
Alembic potential's not harmonic oscillator Hooke's law potentials.
Right?

290
00:19:22.261 --> 00:19:25.360
But the idea of a double minimum is the same.
So we'll,
uh,

291
00:19:25.440 --> 00:19:28.200
we'll suppose that the atoms are equivalent.
So the bottom of the,

292
00:19:28.201 --> 00:19:30.240
well as the same on both sides.

293
00:19:31.260 --> 00:19:36.030
And guess and energy and low and behold,
we were right.
We got the solution,

294
00:19:36.031 --> 00:19:38.340
and you've seen that one.
Okay.

295
00:19:38.580 --> 00:19:42.090
But you can also get that one one with one node,
right?

296
00:19:42.330 --> 00:19:43.980
And from the on the far left,

297
00:19:43.981 --> 00:19:46.540
you can see that they have the same curvature over amplitudes.

298
00:19:46.541 --> 00:19:50.340
So they have essentially the same energy.
If the green energy is right,

299
00:19:50.550 --> 00:19:53.400
the red energy's the same deal,
right?

300
00:19:53.401 --> 00:19:56.700
They're degenerate orbitals because they're far apart.

301
00:19:58.110 --> 00:20:00.390
Okay?
No significant energy difference.

302
00:20:00.930 --> 00:20:03.210
Now suppose we increase the overlap.

303
00:20:04.020 --> 00:20:06.750
What will happen if we shorten the distance?

304
00:20:06.751 --> 00:20:09.390
You did this on a problem set with Aaron,
right?

305
00:20:09.660 --> 00:20:14.280
So you bring them closer together and you have the one with no nodes and the one

306
00:20:14.281 --> 00:20:18.270
with one node and now there's a little right halfway between.

307
00:20:18.480 --> 00:20:23.310
There's more electron density in one than there is in the other,
right?

308
00:20:23.460 --> 00:20:24.480
One has that.

309
00:20:24.490 --> 00:20:28.530
The anti-bonding one has zero and the bonding one has some build up of an

310
00:20:28.531 --> 00:20:30.090
electron density in between,

311
00:20:30.300 --> 00:20:35.300
but the energy hasn't changed visibly on this scale that we're using.

312
00:20:35.610 --> 00:20:37.980
Looks just the same.
Okay?

313
00:20:38.430 --> 00:20:42.330
Now we increase it more and now there's a big difference in the middle,
right?

314
00:20:42.540 --> 00:20:45.870
And now the energies are beginning to change.
One,
the,

315
00:20:45.871 --> 00:20:49.600
the unfavorable orbital is going up in the favorable bonding.

316
00:20:49.601 --> 00:20:54.310
Orbitals is going down in energy.
And if we get it still closer together,

317
00:20:54.520 --> 00:20:59.200
uh,
we can see that there's now a big difference,
uh,
between them.

318
00:21:00.690 --> 00:21:01.523
<v 1>Okay,</v>

319
00:21:01.530 --> 00:21:06.530
<v 0>so that increasing overlap creates the splitting that we talk about.</v>

320
00:21:07.080 --> 00:21:11.780
We've,
this is just review as you know,
but it's worth,
it's so important.
It's a,

321
00:21:11.970 --> 00:21:16.560
that's good to mention it again.
Now that overlap holds the atoms together.

322
00:21:16.561 --> 00:21:19.500
And this again is a picture we saw before that,

323
00:21:19.560 --> 00:21:23.190
except we're going to do it with writing in the equations.
Remember,

324
00:21:23.250 --> 00:21:27.150
a good guests of the form of the molecular orbital is one over the square root

325
00:21:27.151 --> 00:21:31.980
of two times a plus B or one over the square root of two times a minus B.

326
00:21:32.280 --> 00:21:37.020
And that will give to new orbitals one better in one worse.

327
00:21:37.560 --> 00:21:41.130
And in fact,
if you try,
if you think about normalization,

328
00:21:41.131 --> 00:21:44.580
it should be a little less than one over the square root of two in the one

329
00:21:44.581 --> 00:21:48.900
that's going to have plus two Ab and a 20th square it and a little less than one

330
00:21:48.901 --> 00:21:52.830
over the square root of two when it's going to have a minus sign for the two ab

331
00:21:52.831 --> 00:21:57.090
term.
Okay?
Now because of that little bit,

332
00:21:57.350 --> 00:21:59.640
a little bit greater and a little bit less,

333
00:21:59.850 --> 00:22:03.870
the energies aren't quite as we saw before,
equally split up and down.

334
00:22:04.620 --> 00:22:09.030
The one that goes down doesn't go down quite as much because this is less than.

335
00:22:09.300 --> 00:22:13.480
And the one that goes up goes up a little more because it's greater than that.

336
00:22:13.530 --> 00:22:15.990
The mathematical,
uh,
uh,

337
00:22:16.020 --> 00:22:19.500
requirement for that isn't immediately obvious to you,
but it's true.

338
00:22:21.150 --> 00:22:21.650
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

339
00:22:21.650 --> 00:22:21.951
<v 0>Okay.</v>

340
00:22:21.951 --> 00:22:25.490
So there's there the new orbitals you get when you bring the atoms together.

341
00:22:26.600 --> 00:22:30.140
Okay?
And if you had more overlap,
there'd be a bigger difference.

342
00:22:30.170 --> 00:22:33.800
So that's why overlap is important.
The more overlap,
the more splitting.

343
00:22:33.801 --> 00:22:38.780
We just saw that with in one dimension with Arab and meets goldilocks.
Now,

344
00:22:39.080 --> 00:22:43.070
how many electrons do we have to put in these orbitals that's gonna make a big

345
00:22:43.071 --> 00:22:47.240
difference.
So suppose we have just one electron for these two orbitals.

346
00:22:47.540 --> 00:22:51.560
When we bring the two wells together would bring the two atoms together.

347
00:22:51.770 --> 00:22:55.670
That electron will go down and energy to the new molecular orbital.

348
00:22:56.060 --> 00:22:59.060
So that's going to be good.
And if we tried to pull them apart,

349
00:22:59.061 --> 00:23:03.920
the electronic would have to go back up in energy and that would require energy

350
00:23:04.130 --> 00:23:07.910
and that would be opposed the breaking.
So that's the bond strength,
right?

351
00:23:07.911 --> 00:23:12.380
You have to put an electron up that much.
Now I suppose there were two electrons.

352
00:23:12.590 --> 00:23:16.730
Now a second one goes down the same way so it's even stronger.

353
00:23:16.850 --> 00:23:21.140
It won't in truth be quite twice as strong.

354
00:23:21.141 --> 00:23:24.470
Do you see why?
Yeah,

355
00:23:25.670 --> 00:23:27.920
because the electrons will repel one another.
We're not,

356
00:23:28.280 --> 00:23:31.520
we haven't taken that into account when we think about the energies here,

357
00:23:31.760 --> 00:23:35.480
but it'll be certainly stronger.
It's considerably stronger.
Okay.

358
00:23:36.050 --> 00:23:38.570
Now suppose we had three electrons.

359
00:23:40.110 --> 00:23:41.010
<v 1>What's going to happen?</v>

360
00:23:43.230 --> 00:23:46.280
<v 0>One of them is going to have to go up instead of down.</v>

361
00:23:46.760 --> 00:23:51.760
And in fact it will go up further than either of the others went down.

362
00:23:53.090 --> 00:23:57.590
Even neglecting electron repulsion.
Right?
Because of that greater than,

363
00:23:57.591 --> 00:24:01.550
less than thing.
That shifted the pair up a little bit.
Okay.

364
00:24:01.700 --> 00:24:06.020
So that's going to be even weaker than having one electron to hold them together

365
00:24:06.800 --> 00:24:08.930
when you have three.
How about if you have four

366
00:24:12.800 --> 00:24:16.050
Wilson?
Yeah,
it'll,
you're,

367
00:24:16.150 --> 00:24:20.570
you're now definitely losing because the two that go up go up more than the two

368
00:24:20.571 --> 00:24:24.170
that go down and go down.
So that's bad.
So we can summarize that here.

369
00:24:24.171 --> 00:24:27.080
The effect on the bond,
if you have one electron,
it's bonding.

370
00:24:27.320 --> 00:24:31.580
Two electrons are strongly bonding,
three electrons is weekly bonding,

371
00:24:31.670 --> 00:24:35.510
probably,
and four electrons will definitely be anti-bonding.

372
00:24:35.511 --> 00:24:40.511
So that's why helium bounces off helium until it gets 52 on strums apart.

373
00:24:41.660 --> 00:24:44.180
Right.
And there,
then there's this very,
very,

374
00:24:44.181 --> 00:24:48.410
very weak bond that we talked about due to the correlation to the electrons.

375
00:24:49.160 --> 00:24:52.250
Right.
But as soon as you get overlap with helium,

376
00:24:52.460 --> 00:24:55.370
it's repulsive when you start to split these levels.

377
00:24:57.020 --> 00:24:59.960
Okay.
Now.
Oh Wow.
Let's look at the other end.

378
00:24:59.990 --> 00:25:03.890
Why does it increasing overlap as you bring things closer together?

379
00:25:05.120 --> 00:25:08.060
Why doesn't that make these plum puddings collapse?

380
00:25:08.210 --> 00:25:12.830
The electrons are getting more and more stable as you increase the overlap by

381
00:25:12.831 --> 00:25:16.160
bringing things closer together.
So why doesn't it just collapse?

382
00:25:22.030 --> 00:25:22.400
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

383
00:25:22.400 --> 00:25:23.750
<v 0>In fact,
the electrons,</v>

384
00:25:23.780 --> 00:25:28.430
if hydrogen molecule collapsed two helium,

385
00:25:28.700 --> 00:25:31.370
it would be a funny helium because it would have no neutrons.

386
00:25:32.000 --> 00:25:33.170
But if it collapsed,

387
00:25:33.380 --> 00:25:37.520
the electrons indeed would become 55% more stable.

388
00:25:37.521 --> 00:25:42.521
The electrons in helium are lower in energy than the electrons in h two right?

389
00:25:44.151 --> 00:25:47.900
So that would tend to pull them together all the way to [inaudible] zero.

390
00:25:48.200 --> 00:25:50.870
Why don't they Elizabeth?

391
00:25:51.920 --> 00:25:56.870
Cause the protons will repel one another.
That depends on one over R.
Right?

392
00:25:56.960 --> 00:26:00.080
And that increases much more dramatically in fact,

393
00:26:00.420 --> 00:26:05.150
that the amount by which the electrons become more stable as 650 kilocalories

394
00:26:05.420 --> 00:26:08.150
per mole or would become more stable.
Right.

395
00:26:08.510 --> 00:26:13.510
But the new nuclear repulsion increases by that much.

396
00:26:14.120 --> 00:26:18.080
By the time they get to 0.3 Ostrom's let alone the last little bit.

397
00:26:18.081 --> 00:26:21.050
When one over r gets enormous.
Okay.

398
00:26:21.320 --> 00:26:25.760
So it's not worth it unless you have glue to hold the neutrons together.

399
00:26:26.390 --> 00:26:26.780
Right?

400
00:26:26.780 --> 00:26:31.580
So on the sun you can take deuterium and fuse it into heat to make a helium.

401
00:26:31.581 --> 00:26:35.810
You have neutrons there to hold the protons together and then you get 200

402
00:26:35.810 --> 00:26:38.600
million kilocalories per mole,
which is of course nuclear energy,

403
00:26:38.601 --> 00:26:41.910
not electronic energy.
It is possible,
but uh,

404
00:26:42.230 --> 00:26:47.220
not an under the chemical circumstances that we're talking about.
Okay,

405
00:26:47.310 --> 00:26:50.250
so here's the morse potential.
Yeah.
Lucas,

406
00:26:56.190 --> 00:27:00.120
no are only sort of subliminally,

407
00:27:01.320 --> 00:27:05.610
right?
Because if you take,
at first glance there's going to be nuclear,

408
00:27:05.611 --> 00:27:09.660
nuclear repulsion,
electron electron repulsion between the atoms,

409
00:27:09.870 --> 00:27:13.260
nuclear electron attraction,
nuclear electron attraction.

410
00:27:13.440 --> 00:27:17.400
So to first approximation,
those law cancel out.
Right?

411
00:27:17.520 --> 00:27:21.210
But then you get on top of that,
you have a little change from,

412
00:27:21.360 --> 00:27:26.360
from the fact that the nuclear nuclear goes as one over r and gets quite big

413
00:27:26.611 --> 00:27:30.030
when they get really close and that the electrons are coming down because of

414
00:27:30.031 --> 00:27:33.780
overlap.
And we'd been focusing on this overlap thing that causes the bonding.

415
00:27:34.080 --> 00:27:37.080
But obviously things aren't going to collapse because of the nuclear part.

416
00:27:37.081 --> 00:27:41.940
But we haven't been talking about it explicitly.
You're right.
Okay.
So anyhow,

417
00:27:41.941 --> 00:27:45.060
this is the form of the bonding potential,
the Morse potential,

418
00:27:45.061 --> 00:27:50.061
which was just cobbled together artificially to make it convenient to calculate

419
00:27:50.131 --> 00:27:53.280
things and to have a reasonable properties for a bond.

420
00:27:53.281 --> 00:27:57.330
But now we understand why it should look like that.

421
00:27:57.600 --> 00:27:58.770
This first part,

422
00:27:58.800 --> 00:28:02.610
the attractive part is because the electron pair becomes more stable with

423
00:28:02.611 --> 00:28:05.760
increasing overlap as the atoms come together,

424
00:28:06.060 --> 00:28:10.650
and then the nuclear propulsion becomes dominant when it becomes too close,

425
00:28:11.340 --> 00:28:14.940
right?
So all of this is cool ohms law.

426
00:28:14.941 --> 00:28:18.960
There's nothing special.
There's not correlation energy,

427
00:28:18.990 --> 00:28:22.290
which is some completely new physical phenomenon,
right?

428
00:28:22.470 --> 00:28:26.790
It's all Coolum big correlation energy is just remember it,
uh,

429
00:28:26.791 --> 00:28:31.500
an excuse to for the,
uh,
for the area or making or a way to hide it.

430
00:28:32.010 --> 00:28:36.990
Okay.
So it all comes from,
from coolamons law for potential energy and that,

431
00:28:37.020 --> 00:28:40.440
but the funny thing was the kinetic energy of the electrons according to

432
00:28:40.441 --> 00:28:44.460
Schrodinger,
right?
Because as you make things,
as you concentrate things,

433
00:28:44.461 --> 00:28:48.090
you change the curvature as well.
So you have to take that into account.

434
00:28:48.420 --> 00:28:53.420
But this curve provides the potential for studying molecular vibration.

435
00:28:55.260 --> 00:28:57.510
That is,
once you know the form of this curve,

436
00:28:58.320 --> 00:29:01.530
then you can use quantum mechanics for the motion to the Adams,

437
00:29:01.740 --> 00:29:05.700
not of the electrons,
but of the Adams.
And figure out how atoms vibrate,

438
00:29:05.730 --> 00:29:10.380
which we've already done when we were doing urban meets goldilocks.
Okay.

439
00:29:10.381 --> 00:29:12.510
But here finally,

440
00:29:12.690 --> 00:29:16.440
we understand the Adam Adam Force law,
right?

441
00:29:16.441 --> 00:29:19.950
That's what we've been doing the whole time for four weeks or five weeks or

442
00:29:19.951 --> 00:29:22.960
whatever it's been right is trying to understand where the,

443
00:29:22.961 --> 00:29:26.780
what the forest law is.
Wouldn't Newton be happier?
Remember he said there,

444
00:29:26.790 --> 00:29:27.960
therefore,
agents in nature,

445
00:29:27.961 --> 00:29:31.560
April to make particles of bodies stick together by various strong attractions.

446
00:29:31.770 --> 00:29:35.130
And it's the business of experimental philosophy to find them out.

447
00:29:35.250 --> 00:29:36.870
And now we found that out.

448
00:29:37.830 --> 00:29:42.670
Now can we use this understanding then to gain greater purchase on,

449
00:29:43.000 --> 00:29:47.140
on a chemistry?
So we've looked at overlap,

450
00:29:47.141 --> 00:29:50.890
but there's one other thing we have to look at in order to apply it.

451
00:29:51.100 --> 00:29:54.810
And that's what's what we call energy match.
Uh,

452
00:29:54.811 --> 00:29:59.710
I don't think anybody else talks about energy match,
but we do.
Okay.

453
00:29:59.711 --> 00:30:03.760
So here's what we talked about already,
right?
And we have this splitting,

454
00:30:03.761 --> 00:30:07.510
which is about proportional to overlap.
It's not numerically,

455
00:30:07.511 --> 00:30:09.280
strictly proportional to overlap,

456
00:30:09.490 --> 00:30:14.050
but it certainly is close to proportional to overlap.
Okay.
Now,

457
00:30:14.051 --> 00:30:16.720
what would happen if the two atoms you started with?

458
00:30:16.721 --> 00:30:21.721
We're not the same if one was a better place for electrons to be than the other,

459
00:30:22.300 --> 00:30:26.410
like their for example.
So why,

460
00:30:26.650 --> 00:30:30.400
why would you remember what happened is you mix these,
you get a plus B,

461
00:30:30.401 --> 00:30:31.450
an a minus B,

462
00:30:31.660 --> 00:30:36.660
but why would you put any a together with B if B is already much better than a,

463
00:30:39.040 --> 00:30:41.810
if they're,
if they're equal,
you don't care where it is,
then fine.

464
00:30:41.811 --> 00:30:45.250
Use a 50 50 mixture.
But if one's better than the other,

465
00:30:46.240 --> 00:30:50.230
why use any of the,
of the,
uh,
of the inferior one?

466
00:30:50.231 --> 00:30:52.480
Why not just use the one that's good.

467
00:30:53.230 --> 00:30:58.230
So we already actually saw this in the case of the one s or atomic orbitals,

468
00:30:59.710 --> 00:31:04.710
which did remain pure and unmixed when we made the molecular orbitals that funny

469
00:31:04.781 --> 00:31:08.230
molecule last time the,
the flouro ethanol,

470
00:31:09.250 --> 00:31:12.850
remember it looked like that one of them was just an s orbital on f.

471
00:31:13.090 --> 00:31:16.870
Another one was an s orbital sr brittle on one carbon Sr.

472
00:31:16.871 --> 00:31:20.020
But along the other carbon,
they didn't mix.
Right?

473
00:31:20.320 --> 00:31:23.110
But the next door battle,
the,

474
00:31:23.120 --> 00:31:28.000
so the compact one one s Corp orbitals did remain pure and unmixed.

475
00:31:28.210 --> 00:31:33.100
Right?
But the valence level,
atomic orbitals,
we're heavily mixed.
For example,

476
00:31:33.101 --> 00:31:35.680
the next one was biggest on fluorine,

477
00:31:35.681 --> 00:31:40.630
but also substantial on oxygen and carbon even got into the act a little bit

478
00:31:41.290 --> 00:31:45.430
right now.
Why is it that the core orbitals didn't mix

479
00:31:46.930 --> 00:31:51.610
and the valence or did mix?
What's different?

480
00:31:54.040 --> 00:31:57.460
The core orbitals are very small,
very compact.

481
00:31:58.480 --> 00:32:03.370
These orbitals are bigger.
So what happens?
They overlap,

482
00:32:04.480 --> 00:32:08.950
right?
So it's overlap that causes things to mix.

483
00:32:09.490 --> 00:32:12.880
If there's no overlap,
they don't mix.
If they overlap,
they mix.

484
00:32:14.830 --> 00:32:16.990
So why use any of an inferior orbital?

485
00:32:17.560 --> 00:32:20.040
Well suppose the energy of a is much higher,

486
00:32:20.050 --> 00:32:24.450
less favorable than that of be right.
So now we,
we make uh,

487
00:32:24.460 --> 00:32:27.700
some of some a weighted sum,
a parts of a,
B,

488
00:32:27.701 --> 00:32:30.280
parts of B and we square it.

489
00:32:30.460 --> 00:32:35.460
So we get a square parts of ace of the aid density be square parts of the bead

490
00:32:36.131 --> 00:32:39.040
density and also this overlap term to a beak.

491
00:32:40.400 --> 00:32:45.400
Now can you profit from shifting electron density toward the internuclear Ab

492
00:32:46.641 --> 00:32:51.260
region without paying too much of the high energy cost of a,

493
00:32:51.261 --> 00:32:55.610
that is a squared is higher energy than B squared,
right?

494
00:32:55.611 --> 00:32:59.990
The electron density around a is higher energy than the electron density about
B.

495
00:33:00.260 --> 00:33:01.910
And if you mix a with B,

496
00:33:02.060 --> 00:33:07.060
you're going to get a certain amount of that bad or less good distribution a

497
00:33:07.251 --> 00:33:11.870
squared.
But at the same time you're going to get some of Ab,

498
00:33:12.440 --> 00:33:17.390
which,
which puts stuff in the middle at the expense of outside.

499
00:33:17.391 --> 00:33:21.470
That's good,
right?
You'd rather at a certain distance from the nuclei,

500
00:33:21.650 --> 00:33:25.340
you'd rather be between the new,
the new between the two nuclei,

501
00:33:25.580 --> 00:33:29.240
then out beyond one of them.
So as you increase a,

502
00:33:29.600 --> 00:33:33.920
you increase,
uh,
oops,
sorry,
you increase this bad part,

503
00:33:34.580 --> 00:33:36.770
which you also increase that good part.

504
00:33:37.520 --> 00:33:41.030
Can it be worthwhile to make a non zero,

505
00:33:41.360 --> 00:33:45.370
which one is going to help?
But notice this a small,

506
00:33:45.410 --> 00:33:47.660
if you put only a small amount of a man,

507
00:33:48.230 --> 00:33:51.170
then the amount of a squared probability density,

508
00:33:51.171 --> 00:33:55.700
this bit here is a squared parts of that really,

509
00:33:55.701 --> 00:33:58.810
really tiny if a is tiny.
But the uh,

510
00:33:58.880 --> 00:34:03.500
the amount of Ab you put in is a times B,
not a squared,

511
00:34:03.980 --> 00:34:05.090
right?
So it's much bigger.

512
00:34:05.090 --> 00:34:10.090
So you get this good stuff without getting very much of this bad stuff right

513
00:34:14.830 --> 00:34:16.160
at for example,

514
00:34:16.280 --> 00:34:20.720
suppose you used a was 0.03 and B was 0.98.

515
00:34:21.410 --> 00:34:24.780
So you square them to find out how much,
whoops,
what did I do?

516
00:34:24.820 --> 00:34:26.450
I pressed that thing there.
Okay.

517
00:34:26.720 --> 00:34:29.960
You Square them and you find out that the amount of a squared you get is only

518
00:34:29.961 --> 00:34:34.961
0.01 the amount of B squared is 0.96 and the amount of two ab is 0.06.

519
00:34:36.950 --> 00:34:41.900
So you're getting 60 times as much of Ab is you get an a squared.

520
00:34:42.170 --> 00:34:45.830
So that's why it can be useful to put a little bit in.
And you could,

521
00:34:45.860 --> 00:34:48.170
if you're pedantic,
you can look at the footnote there.

522
00:34:49.850 --> 00:34:54.740
So let's look at Arab and meets goldilocks in the case where the two wells are

523
00:34:54.741 --> 00:34:55.640
not matched,

524
00:34:55.641 --> 00:34:58.400
where the energies are a little bit different because that's what we're talking

525
00:34:58.401 --> 00:34:59.234
about.

526
00:34:59.390 --> 00:35:03.770
So here's here are non degenerate atomic orbitals.

527
00:35:04.100 --> 00:35:07.700
So the one on the left is a little bit lower than the one on the right,

528
00:35:07.730 --> 00:35:10.370
but only a teeny bit.
Okay.

529
00:35:10.790 --> 00:35:12.950
Now we're going to look at the wave functions here.

530
00:35:12.951 --> 00:35:16.400
So there's the lowest energy wave function,
right?

531
00:35:16.940 --> 00:35:21.830
And notice it's the sub,
it's a weighted sum with no nodes,

532
00:35:22.190 --> 00:35:25.550
but there's almost no mixing at all.
Just a really,
really,

533
00:35:25.551 --> 00:35:30.530
really tiny amount of a in it.
So essentially it's just the,
the,
the,

534
00:35:30.531 --> 00:35:33.530
the solution you'd get in the left.
Well,
right,

535
00:35:33.950 --> 00:35:38.070
there'd be one with one node as well.
What will it look?
Can you guess?

536
00:35:40.710 --> 00:35:43.920
This is the one with zero nodes.
What's,

537
00:35:43.921 --> 00:35:46.830
what's the wave function with one node look like?
Any guesses?

538
00:35:49.640 --> 00:35:53.360
Yeah,
Josh.
Um,
it'll just have a note in the middle of that first potential.

539
00:35:53.420 --> 00:35:56.520
Be Straight on the second.
That'd be what I mean.
You sort of straight up

540
00:35:56.580 --> 00:36:00.300
<v 2>the second one,
right?</v>

541
00:36:00.600 --> 00:36:04.440
<v 0>So the first one,
the lowest one is,
is the,
the one on the left.</v>

542
00:36:04.920 --> 00:36:05.701
The second one,

543
00:36:05.701 --> 00:36:09.420
the next highest energy orbital is the one on the right with just a little bit

544
00:36:09.421 --> 00:36:12.630
of the one on the left in it.
Negligible amount of mixing.
Right.

545
00:36:12.840 --> 00:36:16.950
And their energies.
You might think their energies would be the same,
right?

546
00:36:16.951 --> 00:36:19.840
Because they're not mixing,
but the,

547
00:36:19.930 --> 00:36:24.930
the green one is in this well and the red one is in that well and that wells

548
00:36:25.711 --> 00:36:29.670
higher.
Okay.
So it's gotta be higher and energy.

549
00:36:29.940 --> 00:36:34.140
That splitting is due only to the original offset between the wells.

550
00:36:34.141 --> 00:36:38.070
There's no shift of it,
right?
It's just you have a,

551
00:36:38.071 --> 00:36:40.920
or you have B and you have what you would expect for them.

552
00:36:41.310 --> 00:36:45.240
Now suppose we increased the overlap between these,

553
00:36:46.410 --> 00:36:47.760
what do you think's going to happen?

554
00:36:51.730 --> 00:36:56.560
You should get a little more mixing because Ab is going to count for more if you

555
00:36:56.561 --> 00:36:59.500
have overlap.
Okay,
so here they are close together.

556
00:36:59.501 --> 00:37:03.910
You still don't have very much mixing just a little bit and you haven't seen
any,

557
00:37:04.270 --> 00:37:07.110
any,
uh,
appreciable change in the energies.

558
00:37:07.120 --> 00:37:11.530
You still have that same splitting that's due to the original offset.
Okay,

559
00:37:11.860 --> 00:37:16.630
now we'll bring them still closer together and now it's getting worthwhile to

560
00:37:16.631 --> 00:37:21.520
put it in the wrong.
Well,
because the ab term is so important,
right?

561
00:37:21.550 --> 00:37:26.410
So the,
the,
the anti-bonding energy is rising,
the bonding energy is falling.

562
00:37:27.040 --> 00:37:29.320
That's why they're anti bonding and bonding.

563
00:37:30.040 --> 00:37:32.440
And if we bring them still closer together,

564
00:37:33.490 --> 00:37:36.890
we get that right.
Which if you look,

565
00:37:36.891 --> 00:37:41.200
kid looked at it casually,
they look like a single well,

566
00:37:41.950 --> 00:37:46.660
but notice that,
that they're,
they're still quite unsymmetrical there.

567
00:37:46.670 --> 00:37:51.670
Still biased.
The one without any nodes is still mostly in the left.
Well,

568
00:37:52.180 --> 00:37:55.660
and the one with no,
with a node is mostly in the right.
Well,

569
00:37:55.690 --> 00:37:57.880
but they're heavily mixed,
right?

570
00:37:58.180 --> 00:38:02.830
So what's happening is this increasing overlap as you bring them together is

571
00:38:02.831 --> 00:38:06.490
fighting the effect of the difference.
In the two wells.

572
00:38:07.000 --> 00:38:10.570
So when we had the core electrons and Fluor,
oh,
ethanol,

573
00:38:10.840 --> 00:38:15.370
if we had tiny orbitals that didn't overlap,
then they stayed pure.

574
00:38:15.880 --> 00:38:16.570
Right?

575
00:38:16.570 --> 00:38:20.710
But once we went to the valence level orbitals that are much bigger so that they

576
00:38:20.711 --> 00:38:23.290
overlapped doesn't,
they started mixing like this.

577
00:38:26.170 --> 00:38:29.530
Okay.
Now what if the one partner is lower in energy than a,

578
00:38:29.560 --> 00:38:31.030
that's the case we're dealing with.

579
00:38:31.330 --> 00:38:34.720
But what will these ultimate energies be when you have this,

580
00:38:35.110 --> 00:38:37.420
this competition between overlap,

581
00:38:37.421 --> 00:38:41.260
which is trying to mix them and energy mismatch,

582
00:38:41.440 --> 00:38:46.210
which is trying to keep them separate from one another.
So here's uh,

583
00:38:46.690 --> 00:38:48.760
here's what you get.
You get,
again,

584
00:38:48.761 --> 00:38:53.530
splitting but not as much shift as you got before the lower level.

585
00:38:53.531 --> 00:38:57.340
We'll look mostly like c because c is better than a,

586
00:38:57.970 --> 00:39:02.020
the anti-bonding.
We'll look mostly like a,
with just a little bit of CNN.

587
00:39:03.010 --> 00:39:06.010
And if they had had the same energy,

588
00:39:06.011 --> 00:39:08.830
you'd get a big energy shift because of overlap.

589
00:39:09.820 --> 00:39:14.820
But now you get a smaller energy shift because the mismatch is fighting that,

590
00:39:16.720 --> 00:39:17.980
right?
You don't want to,

591
00:39:18.430 --> 00:39:23.430
you lose as you try to mix because of the difference between a and C in this

592
00:39:24.131 --> 00:39:26.200
case.
Now,
uh,

593
00:39:26.290 --> 00:39:30.880
so that one looks mostly like see both in shape and in energy.

594
00:39:31.390 --> 00:39:34.870
That one looks mostly like a both in shape and energy,

595
00:39:34.871 --> 00:39:38.950
but it's a little worse than a,
and the first one is a little better than see

596
00:39:40.990 --> 00:39:42.850
now how,

597
00:39:42.940 --> 00:39:46.990
how much smaller is that bonding shift when we were mismatched,

598
00:39:46.991 --> 00:39:51.550
they didn't shift as much with the same overlap.
How much less exactly.

599
00:39:51.551 --> 00:39:56.140
Where does it end up?
Well,
that's not so crucially important to you,

600
00:39:56.141 --> 00:39:58.330
but there's a neat trick you can do to see that.

601
00:39:58.660 --> 00:40:02.500
Suppose we have that much energy mismatch.
Okay.

602
00:40:02.710 --> 00:40:07.710
And the red.is halfway between a and or between B C or between a and c since a

603
00:40:08.741 --> 00:40:11.520
and B are the same energy now,
uh,

604
00:40:11.530 --> 00:40:16.530
so when they were perfectly matched a and be perfectly matched an energy,

605
00:40:17.050 --> 00:40:20.680
that's how much splitting you got from that amount of overlap.

606
00:40:24.160 --> 00:40:26.230
So these are the two factors that go into it.

607
00:40:26.231 --> 00:40:29.980
How much splitting you get when they have the same energy and how different the

608
00:40:29.981 --> 00:40:31.180
original energies are.

609
00:40:31.330 --> 00:40:35.740
How can you put those together to find out how much shift you actually get?

610
00:40:37.240 --> 00:40:37.451
Well,

611
00:40:37.451 --> 00:40:42.451
what we do is slide that over and then bend down the blue one so it's

612
00:40:44.441 --> 00:40:48.240
perpendicular to that.
Okay.

613
00:40:48.700 --> 00:40:51.910
And make a rectangle around it and draw the diagonal.

614
00:40:53.680 --> 00:40:58.680
And that diagonal will be the new energy difference between the new levels.

615
00:41:00.910 --> 00:41:04.090
Okay.
Then you say,
why do I make this construction?

616
00:41:04.240 --> 00:41:07.450
It's because there's a quadratic formula that comes in.
So this is,

617
00:41:07.520 --> 00:41:12.520
so the diagonal is the square root of the two of the squares of the two sides.

618
00:41:12.790 --> 00:41:16.390
Some of the squares of the two sides.
Okay.
So we can rotate that,

619
00:41:16.391 --> 00:41:18.970
put a tack in there and rotate it.

620
00:41:19.000 --> 00:41:22.960
And that's going to be the new energy difference.
Okay.

621
00:41:23.590 --> 00:41:27.040
And it's bigger than the original energy difference because the diag and all has

622
00:41:27.041 --> 00:41:31.030
to be Dick bigger than one of the sides.
Uh,

623
00:41:31.090 --> 00:41:33.550
but because of the normalization,

624
00:41:33.560 --> 00:41:37.460
because one of them is a little less than one of them is a little smaller and

625
00:41:37.461 --> 00:41:41.360
one's a little greater.
That was the less than greater than square root of two,

626
00:41:42.050 --> 00:41:45.230
one over the square root of two thing.
It's going to shift up a little bit.

627
00:41:45.231 --> 00:41:48.590
Both levels will shift up a little bit like that.
Right.
I'll do it again.

628
00:41:48.591 --> 00:41:52.190
So you see it both will shift up.
So they're the new levels.

629
00:41:53.390 --> 00:41:57.740
That's how you do it.
Okay.
Uh,
now,

630
00:41:58.550 --> 00:42:02.240
so for a given overlap,
the bonding shift,

631
00:42:02.960 --> 00:42:07.960
how much the electrons changed when the atoms came together is reduced.

632
00:42:08.450 --> 00:42:12.410
If the energies aren't well matched,
if you have the same overlap,

633
00:42:12.710 --> 00:42:16.670
you don't get as strong a bond from that point of view.

634
00:42:16.940 --> 00:42:19.850
The energy's didn't shift down as much or up as much,

635
00:42:21.560 --> 00:42:26.560
but still a plus c will be lower in energy than the original one was a plus B.

636
00:42:30.530 --> 00:42:33.110
Okay.
And we had that construction,

637
00:42:33.530 --> 00:42:35.780
which shows us an interesting thing,

638
00:42:36.320 --> 00:42:41.180
which is the splitting is not very sensitive to the one of these contributions

639
00:42:41.181 --> 00:42:44.960
that smaller,
there are two contributions.
The overlap part.

640
00:42:44.990 --> 00:42:49.520
That's the black Arrow art department.
That's the Blue Arrow and the uh,

641
00:42:49.880 --> 00:42:53.150
uh,
and the energy difference between the energy mismatch,

642
00:42:53.151 --> 00:42:57.650
which is the black arrow.
But if one of those is very small,
like here,

643
00:42:57.830 --> 00:43:02.300
the uh,
the mismatch is that mismatch,

644
00:43:02.420 --> 00:43:05.840
which is black is very big and the overlap,

645
00:43:05.841 --> 00:43:07.430
the blue one is very small,

646
00:43:07.670 --> 00:43:11.540
but you can see that the length of the diagonal is not going to be very

647
00:43:11.541 --> 00:43:16.370
sensitive to what the overlap is.
You could increase that blue overlap,

648
00:43:16.490 --> 00:43:21.440
the width of the,
of the rectangle,
which wouldn't change the Diet.

649
00:43:21.500 --> 00:43:25.220
The diagonal,
very much.
So it's sensitive to the one that's bigger.

650
00:43:26.450 --> 00:43:29.900
Okay.
That don't worry too much about that part.
I just think it's fun.

651
00:43:31.910 --> 00:43:32.661
Uh,
okay,

652
00:43:32.661 --> 00:43:37.310
so we can generalize from this mixing two overlapping orbitals gives one

653
00:43:37.311 --> 00:43:41.570
composite orbital that's lower in energy than either of the parents and one

654
00:43:41.571 --> 00:43:45.020
that's higher in energy than either of the parents.
Okay.

655
00:43:45.350 --> 00:43:47.510
The lower energy combination looks,

656
00:43:47.511 --> 00:43:52.511
that is its shape is most like the lower energy parent and it's same is true for

657
00:43:53.481 --> 00:43:57.020
energy right in the higher one looks like the higher parent

658
00:43:58.700 --> 00:44:00.080
for a given overlap,

659
00:44:00.140 --> 00:44:05.140
increasing energy mismatch decreases the amount of mixing and decreases the

660
00:44:06.321 --> 00:44:10.040
magnitude of the energy shifts.
Now what does this have to do with bonding?

661
00:44:11.240 --> 00:44:15.740
Okay.
The a the a minus.
The electrons are clearly lower in energy,

662
00:44:16.400 --> 00:44:18.530
but that's not really what we're interested in.

663
00:44:18.830 --> 00:44:23.120
We're interested in the change of energy that comes when you break the bond or

664
00:44:23.121 --> 00:44:27.110
make the bond.
So which bond is stronger?

665
00:44:27.140 --> 00:44:31.620
Ab or AC?
How many think a B is stronger?

666
00:44:32.460 --> 00:44:35.490
You have in this scheme,
how many think AC is stronger?

667
00:44:36.240 --> 00:44:38.860
It's clearly got lower energy,
electrons ac,

668
00:44:39.780 --> 00:44:43.080
but this is a classic example of compared to what.

669
00:44:43.940 --> 00:44:44.773
<v 2>Okay,</v>

670
00:44:45.010 --> 00:44:47.530
<v 0>how are we going to break the,
the,
the bond.</v>

671
00:44:47.531 --> 00:44:52.060
Suppose what we're going to do is break it to put two electrons in.

672
00:44:52.061 --> 00:44:56.410
See because that's the lower energy at them or in the other case to put two

673
00:44:56.411 --> 00:45:01.000
electrons in B.
Okay,
so both electrons go the same way.

674
00:45:01.270 --> 00:45:03.070
Can you see anything bad about that?

675
00:45:04.550 --> 00:45:07.010
Why might it be better to put one electron each way?

676
00:45:09.190 --> 00:45:10.023
<v 2>Heaven</v>

677
00:45:13.270 --> 00:45:16.750
<v 0>not spin.
You can put two electrons in an orbital with opposite spin.</v>

678
00:45:16.751 --> 00:45:19.390
So spins not a problem.
If you only have to,

679
00:45:20.420 --> 00:45:22.030
if you had three it would be a problem.

680
00:45:22.830 --> 00:45:24.700
But with two it's the spin is not a problem,

681
00:45:24.701 --> 00:45:28.060
but there's an obvious problem with having both the electrons go to one data,

682
00:45:28.840 --> 00:45:32.080
they'll repel each other if you can put them on opposite when so much better.

683
00:45:32.140 --> 00:45:32.560
Right.

684
00:45:32.560 --> 00:45:36.400
But it wouldn't be possible to do this and that that that it might be plausible

685
00:45:36.401 --> 00:45:39.640
in the case of ASC where C is lower in energy than a,

686
00:45:39.880 --> 00:45:44.620
although the repulsion might make it better to go one on c and one on a.
Okay.

687
00:45:44.621 --> 00:45:47.080
But anyhow,
suppose you break it this way,
which one is,

688
00:45:47.081 --> 00:45:51.820
it would be easier to break which requires less energy.
Red Or blue?

689
00:45:52.630 --> 00:45:55.060
Red requires less energy.
Okay,

690
00:45:55.240 --> 00:46:00.240
so ab is stronger if you're forming a plus B minus if both the electrons are

691
00:46:01.211 --> 00:46:03.220
going in the same way.
Right?

692
00:46:03.910 --> 00:46:07.270
So mismatch aids,

693
00:46:07.330 --> 00:46:12.330
heterologous heterologous uneven braking is to put them both on the same side

694
00:46:12.821 --> 00:46:16.660
rather than one on each side.
That's called homolysis is you'll see in a second.

695
00:46:17.290 --> 00:46:21.610
So if you put them both on one side,
then it easier to break.

696
00:46:21.611 --> 00:46:24.820
If they're mismatched,
the bond is stronger if they're well matched.

697
00:46:25.470 --> 00:46:26.303
<v 2>Okay.</v>

698
00:46:27.000 --> 00:46:28.350
<v 0>That's because that,</v>

699
00:46:28.590 --> 00:46:33.590
but now suppose you do homolysis and put one on each.

700
00:46:34.320 --> 00:46:35.820
Now which one's easier?

701
00:46:37.810 --> 00:46:40.600
Now the blue is less energy than the red.

702
00:46:42.360 --> 00:46:43.193
<v 2>Okay,</v>

703
00:46:43.210 --> 00:46:45.940
<v 0>so now the AC is going to be stronger.</v>

704
00:46:47.050 --> 00:46:50.500
So mismatch hinders whole malice,

705
00:46:51.630 --> 00:46:52.280
<v 2>right?</v>

706
00:46:52.280 --> 00:46:56.840
<v 0>So you can't really say which bond is stronger unless you say,
compared to what?</v>

707
00:46:56.870 --> 00:46:58.370
How are you breaking it apart?

708
00:46:59.770 --> 00:47:00.370
<v 2>Okay.</v>

709
00:47:00.370 --> 00:47:01.870
<v 0>Is All this true?</v>

710
00:47:02.920 --> 00:47:07.540
So I've been weaving this fairy tale for you for the last couple of weeks,

711
00:47:07.720 --> 00:47:12.190
but is it true what we can check that with experiment.
For example,

712
00:47:12.191 --> 00:47:14.800
compare h h with Hf,

713
00:47:15.200 --> 00:47:20.110
h h has perfect matching between the two Adams in HF.

714
00:47:20.111 --> 00:47:24.700
There's a much bigger nuclear charge on f electrons in the valence orbital or

715
00:47:24.701 --> 00:47:27.580
lower in energy on f than they RNA.
Okay?

716
00:47:27.581 --> 00:47:31.120
So if we look at the sigma or but all the valence sigma orbital,

717
00:47:31.270 --> 00:47:36.040
it's symmetrical in the case of h two and quite unsymmetrical in the case of HF,

718
00:47:36.041 --> 00:47:39.550
it's big on f and small on h just as we were speaking of.

719
00:47:40.330 --> 00:47:43.000
That's the sigma big on f right?

720
00:47:43.810 --> 00:47:48.790
But there's also an anti-bonding orbital sigma star,
which has a node.

721
00:47:49.080 --> 00:47:53.920
Uh,
so the,
so that one is the,
the contrary.
It's big on h small on f.

722
00:47:53.980 --> 00:47:58.900
This is just what we were talking about a few minutes ago.
Uh,
and that,

723
00:47:58.930 --> 00:48:02.560
and the electrons of course are only in the sigma,
not in the Sigma Star.

724
00:48:02.561 --> 00:48:04.570
There are only two electrons.
That one's empty.

725
00:48:05.080 --> 00:48:09.970
And that the star means that it's anti bonding,

726
00:48:10.330 --> 00:48:12.910
right?
So it has the node between the nuclei,

727
00:48:13.870 --> 00:48:17.920
planar in the symmetrical case and bent in the case of HF,

728
00:48:17.921 --> 00:48:20.620
but it's still the node.
Now,

729
00:48:20.650 --> 00:48:25.650
how about the experiment heterologous where you break in order to get h plus h

730
00:48:27.101 --> 00:48:31.330
minus in one case or h plus f minus,
and the other case,

731
00:48:31.630 --> 00:48:35.620
in the case of hh,
it costs 400 kilocalories to break the bond.

732
00:48:35.920 --> 00:48:40.330
In the case of HF,
it costs only 373.
Incidentally,

733
00:48:40.331 --> 00:48:44.410
this is a lot of energy to break this bond because you're putting both the

734
00:48:44.411 --> 00:48:47.650
electrons the same place it can happen in solution,

735
00:48:47.651 --> 00:48:51.610
but it's not so easy in the gas phase,
which is what we're talking about.
Okay?

736
00:48:51.611 --> 00:48:53.080
So indeed we were right.

737
00:48:53.440 --> 00:48:58.440
That mismatch weakens the bond for heterologous.

738
00:48:59.170 --> 00:49:03.970
Hf Bond is weaker.
That's why you call it hydrofluoric acid,

739
00:49:04.750 --> 00:49:06.850
right?
Because it can easily break off an age.

740
00:49:07.060 --> 00:49:11.860
You don't call h to Hydrogenics acid or something like that,

741
00:49:11.861 --> 00:49:15.610
right?
But if you break it into two Adams,

742
00:49:15.670 --> 00:49:18.880
h two h atoms,
or an h adamant and f Adam,

743
00:49:19.210 --> 00:49:24.040
then it costs a only 104 for hh,
but 136 for HF.

744
00:49:24.430 --> 00:49:27.760
So the HF bond is stronger if you're breaking to Adams.

745
00:49:28.000 --> 00:49:30.610
So that's the first verification,

746
00:49:30.640 --> 00:49:33.850
experimental verification of what I've been talking to you about.

747
00:49:34.120 --> 00:49:37.890
And we're going to go on next time to talk about x h three which,

748
00:49:37.990 --> 00:49:41.680
which will have lots of experimental data that will show that this stuff is

749
00:49:41.681 --> 00:49:42.280
sensible.
