[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:00:09.475 --> 00:00:11.650
- Everything in
the world was done

00:00:11.650 --> 00:00:15.620
to me that would've killed me.

00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:17.680
And here I am alive.

00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:21.546
- From the Auschwitz experiments
of the Angel of Death--

00:00:21.546 --> 00:00:22.418
- Children!

00:00:22.418 --> 00:00:24.520
Children-- at Auschwitz.

00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:27.905
- Through decades of
isolation and anger--

00:00:27.905 --> 00:00:31.080
- I accuse the world
of stopping to care!

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:32.830
- Eva is tough.

00:00:32.830 --> 00:00:34.487
- Bloody-minded.

00:00:34.487 --> 00:00:35.240
- Gestapo!

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:36.370
Gestapo!

00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:40.370
- She rose to introduce the
Mengele twins to the world--

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:42.430
- She woke us all up.

00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:45.210
- Launched the biggest
manhunt in history.

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:47.110
- The worldwide search
for this war criminal

00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:48.990
was given new
importance this week.

00:00:48.990 --> 00:00:51.230
- Eva's role was
absolutely critical.

00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:54.022
- Forgive mankind's worst crime.

00:00:54.022 --> 00:00:59.380
- I, Eva Moses Kor, hereby
give amnesty to all Nazis--

00:00:59.380 --> 00:01:01.210
- I said you're
going to do what?

00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:02.590
You're going to do what?

00:01:02.590 --> 00:01:08.362
- How could she possibly,
possibly forgive?

00:01:08.362 --> 00:01:13.595
- Free herself and start
a worldwide movement.

00:01:13.595 --> 00:01:15.790
- Forgive your worst enemy.

00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:20.440
It will heal your soul,
and it will set you free.

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:22.946
- I just wanted to
stand up and applaud.

00:01:22.946 --> 00:01:25.730
- It was like [? you meet ?]
[? of ?] an angel.

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:29.065
- The pathway out
of a dark place.

00:01:29.065 --> 00:01:32.080
- A revelation of
what's possible

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:33.790
in the human condition.

00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:35.467
- Even when we're
all long gone--

00:01:35.467 --> 00:01:36.050
- We are free!

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:37.780
- --they'll still
be telling a story.

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:38.980
- We are free!

00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:41.410
- By any standards
of the imagination--

00:01:46.422 --> 00:01:47.630
- What an astounding journey.

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:56.620
- The story of Eva.

00:01:56.620 --> 00:01:59.130
- She's taking you somewhere,
and has taken us somewhere

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:01.210
that we need to
be prepared to go.

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:05.206
[END PLAYBACK]

00:02:05.206 --> 00:02:08.539
SPEAKER 1: All right, so thank
you, Ted, even for being here.

00:02:08.539 --> 00:02:09.699
Ted, let's start with you.

00:02:09.699 --> 00:02:11.115
How did you get
introduced to Eva,

00:02:11.115 --> 00:02:13.210
and decide to take
on this project?

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:14.880
TED GREEN: Well, I
live in Indianapolis

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:17.160
right by Butler University.

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:20.500
And one day I'm sitting at
home in the late afternoon,

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:22.980
and a friend of mine from
Butler calls and says,

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:24.360
hey, I got your next one.

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:26.370
I got your next film.

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:28.630
And I said, well, I'm
working on a film right now.

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:30.810
And he said, no, this is
definitely your next one.

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:33.210
It's about Eva, Eva Kor.

00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:35.810
And I said, what's an Eva Kor?

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:37.500
Seriously, I had no
idea who she was.

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:39.750
And he said, she's a
Holocaust survivor.

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:42.439
And I thought, well,
in all honesty,

00:02:42.439 --> 00:02:43.980
you know, with all
due respect, there

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:45.700
have been a lot of
Holocaust stories.

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:46.950
What makes this one different?

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:48.690
He said, just trust me.

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:49.410
Come over here.

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:50.409
You'll see for yourself.

00:02:50.409 --> 00:02:51.960
She's speaking tonight.

00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:54.360
So I go over there, in
a beautiful theater,

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:55.320
2,000 people.

00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:56.610
It is absolutely packed.

00:02:56.610 --> 00:02:57.870
I sit-in the back.

00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:00.780
And like everybody else
there, I am mesmerized

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:02.760
by this woman's story.

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:04.180
I mean, she's there.

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:06.192
She's just telling
it straightforward.

00:03:06.192 --> 00:03:07.650
And I'm also
mesmerized by the fact

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:10.620
that everybody else is
mesmerized by her as well.

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:12.150
All eyes are right on her.

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:15.960
So I knew this is something
that I really wanted to do.

00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:16.920
I waited a few days.

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:20.100
I drove over to her museum
in Terre Haute, Indiana,

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:22.140
just about 70 miles away.

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:24.180
And I kind of had to pitch her.

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:25.650
And to be honest,
in all honesty,

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:27.114
she was pretty
skeptical at first.

00:03:27.114 --> 00:03:29.280
I mean, to be involved in
one of these documentaries

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:31.920
takes a lot of work.

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:35.030
So I broke out the old charm,
charmed her for a while.

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:36.090
Isn't that right?

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:37.620
Little bit of charm.

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:39.370
Yeah, maybe.

00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:41.279
It took a little
while, but she said--

00:03:41.279 --> 00:03:42.070
we settled on this.

00:03:42.070 --> 00:03:43.570
She said, why don't
you come with me

00:03:43.570 --> 00:03:47.620
on the trip to Auschwitz,
and see what you think.

00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:50.040
And so I went with my
co-producer, Mika Brown,

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:52.460
and others from our
production team.

00:03:52.460 --> 00:03:54.090
And we spent a week there.

00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:57.342
And I ought to say I went
in as a hardened journalist,

00:03:57.342 --> 00:03:59.550
and I thought that this was,
you know, the tough guy,

00:03:59.550 --> 00:04:01.740
and this is just
another story to cover.

00:04:01.740 --> 00:04:03.870
And after three days,
I was crying along

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:05.700
with everybody else.

00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:07.590
It was a life-changing trip.

00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:10.720
It's a life-changing
place to go.

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:13.590
And I believe Eva's, once I
really started to learn it,

00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:15.480
is a life-changing story.

00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:18.240
I mean, you have to see
that this is a woman,

00:04:18.240 --> 00:04:19.500
this is just a--

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:23.730
her story is a stunning
psychological odyssey

00:04:23.730 --> 00:04:26.340
that has played out
so very publicly,

00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:30.300
and is rooted in the worst
event in modern times,

00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:34.260
and now finds this 84-year-old
woman in a walker traveling

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:39.120
the world to preach about
healing and forgiveness

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:40.249
and humanity.

00:04:40.249 --> 00:04:41.790
There are a lot of
ingredients there.

00:04:41.790 --> 00:04:44.507
And I was really
honored to take it on.

00:04:44.507 --> 00:04:46.590
SPEAKER 1: So Eva, let's
have you tell your story.

00:04:46.590 --> 00:04:48.631
I know you speak all over
the country, really all

00:04:48.631 --> 00:04:49.290
over the world.

00:04:49.290 --> 00:04:51.581
And I've been fortunate enough
to see your presentation

00:04:51.581 --> 00:04:52.160
a few times.

00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:54.660
Unfortunately not enough time
for the whole thing today, but

00:04:54.660 --> 00:04:56.820
can you talk about
your time at Auschwitz

00:04:56.820 --> 00:05:01.080
and surviving with your sister,
especially with Dr. Mengele?

00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:06.830
EVA KOR: After four years of
Hungarian Nazi occupation,

00:05:06.830 --> 00:05:11.470
four days in a cattle
car without water,

00:05:11.470 --> 00:05:12.745
just very little air.

00:05:12.745 --> 00:05:15.010
On the cattle car, doors opened.

00:05:15.010 --> 00:05:17.410
We had no idea where we were.

00:05:17.410 --> 00:05:22.920
And within 30 minutes, my
whole family was ripped apart.

00:05:22.920 --> 00:05:26.250
Miriam and I were standing
on the selection platform,

00:05:26.250 --> 00:05:28.020
holding onto one another.

00:05:28.020 --> 00:05:31.170
We did not know what
would happen to us.

00:05:31.170 --> 00:05:33.800
We were completely bewildered.

00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:37.920
We became part of a group
of little girls, all twins.

00:05:37.920 --> 00:05:42.780
There were 13 sets of
twins and one mother.

00:05:42.780 --> 00:05:45.750
One thing that I need to
explain from the beginning.

00:05:45.750 --> 00:05:50.070
From the time that we arrived
in Auschwitz, actually

00:05:50.070 --> 00:05:52.920
from the time we were put in
the cattle car to the time

00:05:52.920 --> 00:05:58.530
we were liberated, no one
ever told us where we were,

00:05:58.530 --> 00:06:01.230
why we were there, and
what would happen to us.

00:06:01.230 --> 00:06:05.270
So everything was going
on as it was happening.

00:06:05.270 --> 00:06:11.870
The first night we were in
the barrack that is there,

00:06:11.870 --> 00:06:16.650
crude and filthy,
three-story-high bunk beds

00:06:16.650 --> 00:06:22.170
with a bench in the middle,
a brick bench in the middle,

00:06:22.170 --> 00:06:26.710
infested with lice and rats.

00:06:26.710 --> 00:06:29.270
We were starved for food.

00:06:29.270 --> 00:06:32.320
We were starved
for human kindness.

00:06:32.320 --> 00:06:37.140
We were starved for the love of
the mothers and fathers we once

00:06:37.140 --> 00:06:38.070
had.

00:06:38.070 --> 00:06:41.040
We had no rights.

00:06:41.040 --> 00:06:46.290
And somehow we had the fierce
determination, which I still

00:06:46.290 --> 00:06:52.110
do not understand where it came
from, to live one more day,

00:06:52.110 --> 00:06:56.100
survive one more experiment.

00:06:56.100 --> 00:07:00.450
I was used in two
types of experiments.

00:07:00.450 --> 00:07:03.480
After roll call-- every morning
and night we had the roll call

00:07:03.480 --> 00:07:05.910
at 6:00 AM and 6:00 PM--

00:07:05.910 --> 00:07:08.250
then Mengele would
come in the barrack

00:07:08.250 --> 00:07:11.690
to count us in the morning.

00:07:11.690 --> 00:07:13.140
Then we got breakfast.

00:07:13.140 --> 00:07:18.660
There was a brownish cup of
liquid, bitter, lukewarm cold

00:07:18.660 --> 00:07:21.780
coffee, zero calories.

00:07:21.780 --> 00:07:24.360
Then we would be
taken for experiments.

00:07:24.360 --> 00:07:26.670
Monday, Wednesday,
and Friday, we

00:07:26.670 --> 00:07:31.770
would be placed naked in a
room for about eight hours.

00:07:31.770 --> 00:07:35.280
They would measure
every part of my body,

00:07:35.280 --> 00:07:37.820
compare it to my twin
sister's and compare it

00:07:37.820 --> 00:07:39.710
to a [? chart. ?]

00:07:39.710 --> 00:07:43.380
These were not
dangerous experiments.

00:07:43.380 --> 00:07:46.050
But even in Auschwitz,
they were very demeaning

00:07:46.050 --> 00:07:50.190
because they made me feel like
I was a nothing and nobody.

00:07:50.190 --> 00:07:53.670
So the only way I could
cope with it after a while

00:07:53.670 --> 00:07:55.990
is blocking it out of my mind.

00:07:55.990 --> 00:08:01.620
The other experiments were on
Tuesday, Thursday and Saturday,

00:08:01.620 --> 00:08:03.240
where they would
take us to a lab

00:08:03.240 --> 00:08:07.380
that I named the
"Blood Lab," tie

00:08:07.380 --> 00:08:10.770
both of my arms to
restrict the blood flow.

00:08:10.770 --> 00:08:13.380
Take a lot of blood
from my left arm.

00:08:13.380 --> 00:08:17.400
Give me a minimum of five
injections into my right arm.

00:08:17.400 --> 00:08:21.060
The content of those
injections we didn't know then,

00:08:21.060 --> 00:08:23.130
nor do I know today.

00:08:23.130 --> 00:08:28.710
The rumor was that they were
germs, diseases, and drugs.

00:08:28.710 --> 00:08:32.130
After one of the injections,
I became very ill

00:08:32.130 --> 00:08:36.010
with a very high fever.

00:08:36.010 --> 00:08:41.549
I was trembling as the August
sun was burning my skin.

00:08:41.549 --> 00:08:44.710
Arms and legs were
swollen and painful.

00:08:44.710 --> 00:08:47.790
And I was covered with red dots.

00:08:47.790 --> 00:08:53.170
Next visit to the Blood Lab they
did, instead of tying my arms,

00:08:53.170 --> 00:08:57.100
they measured my fever, and
I knew I was in trouble.

00:08:57.100 --> 00:08:59.930
I was taken to the hospital.

00:08:59.930 --> 00:09:02.910
It was filled with people who
they looked to me more dead

00:09:02.910 --> 00:09:04.260
than alive.

00:09:04.260 --> 00:09:08.400
Next morning, Mengele
arrived with four doctors.

00:09:08.400 --> 00:09:10.470
Never examined me.

00:09:10.470 --> 00:09:12.510
He looked at my fever
chart, and then he

00:09:12.510 --> 00:09:16.230
declared, laughing
sarcastically, "Too bad.

00:09:16.230 --> 00:09:17.610
She's so young.

00:09:17.610 --> 00:09:20.370
She has only two weeks to live."

00:09:20.370 --> 00:09:24.450
I knew he was right
but I refused to die.

00:09:24.450 --> 00:09:29.130
So I made a second
silent pledge that I

00:09:29.130 --> 00:09:32.430
will do whatever
is within my power

00:09:32.430 --> 00:09:37.890
to prove Dr. Mengele wrong,
to survive and be reunited

00:09:37.890 --> 00:09:40.350
with my twin sister, Miriam.

00:09:40.350 --> 00:09:45.780
For the following two weeks,
I have only one clear memory.

00:09:45.780 --> 00:09:49.770
I remember crawling
on the barrack floor

00:09:49.770 --> 00:09:51.340
because I couldn't walk.

00:09:51.340 --> 00:09:54.630
And I was crawling to
reach a faucet with water

00:09:54.630 --> 00:09:58.350
because this barrack was
not even allocated water.

00:09:58.350 --> 00:10:02.490
After two weeks, my fever
broke, and I immediately

00:10:02.490 --> 00:10:04.290
felt a lot stronger.

00:10:04.290 --> 00:10:06.380
And it took me
another three weeks.

00:10:06.380 --> 00:10:09.600
So I was in the hospital of
the barrack of the living

00:10:09.600 --> 00:10:12.870
dead, I call, for five weeks.

00:10:12.870 --> 00:10:17.330
I was released and reunited
with my twin sister, Miriam.

00:10:17.330 --> 00:10:21.300
What I skipped over,
and I want to reiterate

00:10:21.300 --> 00:10:23.820
because it was very important--

00:10:23.820 --> 00:10:26.950
that first night when we
couldn't go back to our bunk

00:10:26.950 --> 00:10:31.320
beds because the rats were
parading right at the bottom,

00:10:31.320 --> 00:10:36.870
and our bunk beds on the bottom,
and we went to the latrine,

00:10:36.870 --> 00:10:40.830
and I saw three dead children
on the barrack floor.

00:10:40.830 --> 00:10:44.670
I have never seen
anybody dead before.

00:10:44.670 --> 00:10:49.020
But that hit me very
severely, violently,

00:10:49.020 --> 00:10:52.290
to see dead children
on the floor.

00:10:52.290 --> 00:10:55.500
So that was my
first silent pledge.

00:10:55.500 --> 00:10:59.370
Then I said, I will do anything
and everything within my power

00:10:59.370 --> 00:11:04.275
to make sure that Miriam and I
shall not end up on that filthy

00:11:04.275 --> 00:11:07.980
latrine floor, that we actually
would survive and walk out

00:11:07.980 --> 00:11:09.450
of this camp alive.

00:11:09.450 --> 00:11:18.630
And that idea, that mindset that
followed me throughout my days

00:11:18.630 --> 00:11:22.770
in Auschwitz, I wonder if
I would have never seen

00:11:22.770 --> 00:11:25.020
those dead bodies,
would I have been

00:11:25.020 --> 00:11:28.420
able to make that decision.

00:11:28.420 --> 00:11:32.080
Because whatever was wrong, I
was going to somehow survive.

00:11:32.080 --> 00:11:35.490
And so I survived.

00:11:35.490 --> 00:11:38.760
I was released from the
barracks of the living dead.

00:11:38.760 --> 00:11:41.490
My sister was quite
sick in the barrack,

00:11:41.490 --> 00:11:46.050
but she was never
taken to the hospital.

00:11:46.050 --> 00:11:50.470
Life in Auschwitz, for instance,
I want to kind of just--

00:11:50.470 --> 00:11:56.070
today, 74 years ago,
I was in Auschwitz.

00:11:56.070 --> 00:11:57.800
And I was just
trying to reminisce.

00:11:57.800 --> 00:12:01.500
It might have been
the day that we were--

00:12:01.500 --> 00:12:07.260
once a week, usually on Friday,
we were taken to the showers

00:12:07.260 --> 00:12:09.600
to actually give us soap.

00:12:09.600 --> 00:12:12.510
And we washed with the soap.

00:12:12.510 --> 00:12:17.820
Actually, I figured out, I
was in Auschwitz 255 days.

00:12:17.820 --> 00:12:22.355
And we found out later it
was made out of human fat.

00:12:22.355 --> 00:12:26.370
It had very low
[INAUDIBLE] to it.

00:12:26.370 --> 00:12:30.210
We were walking with
our soap, because you

00:12:30.210 --> 00:12:34.870
were given it in the barrack,
and we passed the shower.

00:12:37.890 --> 00:12:41.450
And there was a chill
going through all of us.

00:12:41.450 --> 00:12:46.070
Why did we go further
than the shower room?

00:12:46.070 --> 00:12:51.990
Next, camp was B. We were
in camp A. There was the gas

00:12:51.990 --> 00:12:54.630
chambers and crematoriums.

00:12:54.630 --> 00:12:58.540
And they told us-- some
people said that they sometime

00:12:58.540 --> 00:13:01.330
had these tricks.

00:13:01.330 --> 00:13:06.910
They would tell you to take a
shower, and you end up in the--

00:13:06.910 --> 00:13:08.010
and they did go.

00:13:08.010 --> 00:13:12.760
We finally entered the
shower room in camp B.

00:13:12.760 --> 00:13:17.620
And we kept thinking, what
will come from up there?

00:13:17.620 --> 00:13:20.040
Came water.

00:13:20.040 --> 00:13:23.100
What a relief that was.

00:13:23.100 --> 00:13:27.710
Because what we found out later
on that the camps and shower,

00:13:27.710 --> 00:13:31.250
in camp A the showers
in camp A were broken.

00:13:31.250 --> 00:13:33.860
That is-- but nobody
explained to us anything.

00:13:33.860 --> 00:13:38.490
It was always done
as it happened.

00:13:38.490 --> 00:13:42.240
And life was that way in
the camp at all times.

00:13:42.240 --> 00:13:45.420
Never any information
of what will happen

00:13:45.420 --> 00:13:47.340
or how we are going to--

00:13:47.340 --> 00:13:53.820
we never even knew for
the 255 days in Auschwitz.

00:13:53.820 --> 00:13:56.680
We never knew how we are
going to be liberated.

00:13:56.680 --> 00:14:01.720
I can tell you one thing
that was a great help for me.

00:14:01.720 --> 00:14:05.910
Late in August, one day
there was an airplane

00:14:05.910 --> 00:14:07.810
flying over the camp.

00:14:07.810 --> 00:14:09.630
That was the first time.

00:14:09.630 --> 00:14:12.150
It was flying low.

00:14:12.150 --> 00:14:17.630
I could see the American
flag on one of the wings.

00:14:17.630 --> 00:14:22.970
That gave me hope that
somebody was trying to free us.

00:14:22.970 --> 00:14:28.360
And hope in Auschwitz
was in very short supply.

00:14:28.360 --> 00:14:30.880
There was no one to talk
to and ask, why was there

00:14:30.880 --> 00:14:32.140
American airplane?

00:14:32.140 --> 00:14:33.380
None of us knew.

00:14:33.380 --> 00:14:35.300
And the grown ups
didn't talk to us.

00:14:35.300 --> 00:14:37.870
The supervisor didn't.

00:14:37.870 --> 00:14:42.090
The air raids continued
and increased.

00:14:42.090 --> 00:14:46.140
And every time they were
bombing, we were applauding.

00:14:46.140 --> 00:14:48.630
Because that meant the
Nazis will be defeated,

00:14:48.630 --> 00:14:51.960
and we will win, and
we would be free.

00:14:51.960 --> 00:14:53.550
And that went on.

00:14:53.550 --> 00:14:56.880
By November we had
three air raids a day.

00:14:56.880 --> 00:14:58.830
All the experiments stopped.

00:14:58.830 --> 00:15:04.140
And we could tell that
this cannot go on forever.

00:15:04.140 --> 00:15:07.610
But we're just going
to hope that somehow we

00:15:07.610 --> 00:15:11.480
survive until the
liberation will happen.

00:15:11.480 --> 00:15:16.310
And that happened
late January, 1945.

00:15:16.310 --> 00:15:18.020
We were free.

00:15:18.020 --> 00:15:20.460
We were alive.

00:15:20.460 --> 00:15:24.310
And it was an unbelievable day.

00:15:24.310 --> 00:15:26.260
SPEAKER 1: Thank you
for sharing this story.

00:15:26.260 --> 00:15:29.380
There's a part of the story
that Ted really highlights

00:15:29.380 --> 00:15:30.666
that hasn't been told as much.

00:15:30.666 --> 00:15:32.290
And so Ted, I kind
of want to go to you

00:15:32.290 --> 00:15:34.180
and talk a little
bit about the time

00:15:34.180 --> 00:15:37.330
when he was in Indiana,
and shortly after,

00:15:37.330 --> 00:15:38.530
and she'd been liberated.

00:15:38.530 --> 00:15:41.311
And there was a lot
of anger and stuff

00:15:41.311 --> 00:15:43.060
that she hasn't talked
about as much about

00:15:43.060 --> 00:15:45.100
and that you capture
in the video.

00:15:45.100 --> 00:15:47.660
How did you get to
tell the whole story?

00:15:47.660 --> 00:15:49.900
TED GREEN: Well, first I
would really like, again,

00:15:49.900 --> 00:15:53.830
to think Eva and her CANDLES
Museum, because they allowed

00:15:53.830 --> 00:15:56.590
us to travel with Eva
all over the world, which

00:15:56.590 --> 00:15:58.360
gave us wonderful insight.

00:15:58.360 --> 00:16:00.640
We were able to do
an interview with her

00:16:00.640 --> 00:16:04.870
in her tiny, little Romania,
Transylvania town of ports,

00:16:04.870 --> 00:16:07.820
in the one-room schoolhouse
where she and her twin sister

00:16:07.820 --> 00:16:10.810
Miriam were forced to
kneel on corn kernels

00:16:10.810 --> 00:16:12.820
while all the other
kids made fun of them

00:16:12.820 --> 00:16:14.710
and called them dirty Jews.

00:16:14.710 --> 00:16:17.290
We were able to interview
her in the blood lab

00:16:17.290 --> 00:16:19.930
that she was talking about
where they had blood drawn,

00:16:19.930 --> 00:16:23.080
and they gave the
mysterious injections.

00:16:23.080 --> 00:16:25.570
We were able to interview
her at the graveside

00:16:25.570 --> 00:16:30.880
of her twin, Miriam, in
Ashkelon Cemetery in Israel.

00:16:30.880 --> 00:16:33.482
And we were also able-- this
is a real highlight, I think,

00:16:33.482 --> 00:16:35.440
for a lot of us-- we were
able to interview her

00:16:35.440 --> 00:16:38.470
on a tiny little boat
off the port of Haifa,

00:16:38.470 --> 00:16:42.190
where, in 1950,
she and her sister

00:16:42.190 --> 00:16:44.470
and a whole bunch
of other refugees

00:16:44.470 --> 00:16:46.160
really first tasted freedom.

00:16:46.160 --> 00:16:48.951
And they all stood up and
they sang the Israeli National

00:16:48.951 --> 00:16:49.450
Anthem.

00:16:49.450 --> 00:16:52.990
And so, of course, Eva on
the boat just impromptu

00:16:52.990 --> 00:16:54.190
breaks into singing it.

00:16:54.190 --> 00:16:58.240
So we were able to be with
her in these super important

00:16:58.240 --> 00:17:00.310
places, which helps open up.

00:17:00.310 --> 00:17:05.140
But yes, in a deeper sense,
the reason we were able to do--

00:17:05.140 --> 00:17:07.089
to get to that new
side of the story

00:17:07.089 --> 00:17:08.650
was because of her courage.

00:17:08.650 --> 00:17:12.910
She had the courage to
open up to us things

00:17:12.910 --> 00:17:16.069
that she really hadn't
opened up much about before.

00:17:16.069 --> 00:17:18.160
I believe, generally,
her story before

00:17:18.160 --> 00:17:20.980
had been told in two parts, what
I call part one and part three.

00:17:20.980 --> 00:17:23.079
Part one being her
time at Auschwitz,

00:17:23.079 --> 00:17:26.290
part three being her
forgiveness, which was in 1995.

00:17:26.290 --> 00:17:30.730
Well, there's 50-- exactly a
half century in the middle that

00:17:30.730 --> 00:17:31.480
was--

00:17:31.480 --> 00:17:34.214
it was extremely
painful for Eva.

00:17:34.214 --> 00:17:36.630
And that's why she didn't like
to talk about it very much.

00:17:36.630 --> 00:17:40.750
It included a really
ugly hard-to-watch arrest

00:17:40.750 --> 00:17:42.370
in the US capitol.

00:17:42.370 --> 00:17:46.510
And so this was very
troubling for her.

00:17:46.510 --> 00:17:49.060
But she did open up to us.

00:17:49.060 --> 00:17:50.860
And I think that
what that showed

00:17:50.860 --> 00:17:54.220
is that it ultimately
showed what kind of set

00:17:54.220 --> 00:17:58.680
the stage for the forgiveness
that would change her life,

00:17:58.680 --> 00:18:00.940
and has, in turn,
changed, I would

00:18:00.940 --> 00:18:03.190
say, hundreds of
thousands of lives

00:18:03.190 --> 00:18:05.410
since then through
the work she's doing.

00:18:05.410 --> 00:18:08.440
So really, it was
through her courage

00:18:08.440 --> 00:18:11.580
that we were able to
get that full story out.

00:18:11.580 --> 00:18:14.080
SPEAKER 1: And Eva, I want you
to talk about the forgiveness

00:18:14.080 --> 00:18:14.890
piece.

00:18:14.890 --> 00:18:17.740
But how did you come to,
and I guess, why did you

00:18:17.740 --> 00:18:22.010
decide to open up to Ted about
this painful part of your life?

00:18:22.010 --> 00:18:25.700
EVA KOR: Number one,
talking about forgiveness

00:18:25.700 --> 00:18:27.310
is a very positive thing.

00:18:27.310 --> 00:18:31.840
And it is easier than talking
about the painful things.

00:18:31.840 --> 00:18:34.590
And when I talk
about forgiveness,

00:18:34.590 --> 00:18:39.940
it is difficult to mix the
trauma that I experienced

00:18:39.940 --> 00:18:42.880
in the United States
with the forgiveness

00:18:42.880 --> 00:18:45.400
because it makes it very long.

00:18:45.400 --> 00:18:49.630
The other thing that
nobody asked me in detail

00:18:49.630 --> 00:18:50.770
what Ted asked me.

00:18:50.770 --> 00:18:53.300
So well, the old question,
if you don't ask,

00:18:53.300 --> 00:18:54.790
you don't get to answer.

00:18:57.650 --> 00:19:00.390
He was very determined.

00:19:00.390 --> 00:19:03.230
And he researched it.

00:19:03.230 --> 00:19:05.650
And his questions
were clear-cut,

00:19:05.650 --> 00:19:11.450
and there was no other way
but to enter them straight on.

00:19:11.450 --> 00:19:15.020
Also, I did not
really know how far

00:19:15.020 --> 00:19:17.770
he was going to go with that.

00:19:17.770 --> 00:19:21.260
As I like to tell him,
you're digging into my soul,

00:19:21.260 --> 00:19:24.620
and I don't like it.

00:19:24.620 --> 00:19:28.130
Because these
soul-diggings are painful.

00:19:28.130 --> 00:19:31.730
And we don't really want
to get every morning up

00:19:31.730 --> 00:19:36.410
and think about the worst
experiences in our life.

00:19:36.410 --> 00:19:39.740
And particularly living
in the United States,

00:19:39.740 --> 00:19:44.070
one would not think that
my pain was continuing.

00:19:44.070 --> 00:19:48.470
And it was continuing to
a very, very big extent,

00:19:48.470 --> 00:19:55.010
to be realizing that I
think that the two best

00:19:55.010 --> 00:19:58.740
governments under which I lived
were Israel and the United

00:19:58.740 --> 00:20:02.130
States, but they
are not perfect.

00:20:02.130 --> 00:20:04.010
None of them are perfect.

00:20:04.010 --> 00:20:10.790
I mean, I have suffered
here in the United States

00:20:10.790 --> 00:20:15.260
from things that might have
happened that the government

00:20:15.260 --> 00:20:17.370
has done or people have done.

00:20:17.370 --> 00:20:20.270
That is a very touchy
thing to talk about.

00:20:20.270 --> 00:20:21.830
I don't really like to talk.

00:20:21.830 --> 00:20:24.590
I don't want to accuse the
United States of not doing

00:20:24.590 --> 00:20:26.870
the right thing every time.

00:20:26.870 --> 00:20:28.140
But sometimes they're not.

00:20:28.140 --> 00:20:30.070
Sometimes they make mistakes.

00:20:30.070 --> 00:20:32.160
I was asking too many questions.

00:20:32.160 --> 00:20:35.000
And so that is a
reason that I never

00:20:35.000 --> 00:20:37.650
really wanted to talk about it.

00:20:37.650 --> 00:20:39.170
But I wanted answers.

00:20:39.170 --> 00:20:45.320
The fact that the United
States was so interested

00:20:45.320 --> 00:20:49.100
in the Mengele case, in
one way it was hopeful.

00:20:49.100 --> 00:20:52.760
Maybe they will give
us answers, too, right?

00:20:52.760 --> 00:20:55.690
But then they never
gave us any answers.

00:20:55.690 --> 00:20:58.490
They just gave us decisions.

00:20:58.490 --> 00:21:04.500
And when the decision
in 1985 in June--

00:21:04.500 --> 00:21:07.970
we just went to
Auschwitz in 1985

00:21:07.970 --> 00:21:10.790
with the first
group of survivors

00:21:10.790 --> 00:21:14.840
to celebrate 40 years to
the liberation of the camp.

00:21:14.840 --> 00:21:19.010
And we made headlines
throughout the world.

00:21:19.010 --> 00:21:23.540
As a result of that,
the Attorney General,

00:21:23.540 --> 00:21:29.990
I think his name was Smith,
opened the airport in trying

00:21:29.990 --> 00:21:33.110
to find Mengele and arrest him.

00:21:33.110 --> 00:21:37.010
So then by June, the
United States government

00:21:37.010 --> 00:21:40.090
had a report that
Mengele's bones

00:21:40.090 --> 00:21:43.420
were found in Embu, Brazil.

00:21:43.420 --> 00:21:46.510
They talked to many
Holocaust organizations

00:21:46.510 --> 00:21:50.030
in the United States, many
politicians, but not us,

00:21:50.030 --> 00:21:53.680
the twins, who were
directly affected by it.

00:21:53.680 --> 00:21:57.490
And that was my protest
in Washington DC.

00:21:57.490 --> 00:22:02.220
I felt that they should-- if it
is important to United States,

00:22:02.220 --> 00:22:07.120
that they should have an
open hearing in Washington,

00:22:07.120 --> 00:22:10.480
and not just give
that determination.

00:22:10.480 --> 00:22:14.320
And I knew that nobody
would like me to protest,

00:22:14.320 --> 00:22:20.860
but they saw my little cardboard
that was 8 by 20 cardboard.

00:22:20.860 --> 00:22:26.120
I hand wrote it, that the
memory services are not enough.

00:22:26.120 --> 00:22:31.490
We need an open hearing
on Mengele [? gate. ?]

00:22:31.490 --> 00:22:34.490
They let me through
the security.

00:22:34.490 --> 00:22:39.140
And then when I held it
up, they arrested me,

00:22:39.140 --> 00:22:43.880
but it was the brutality of
it that was really startling,

00:22:43.880 --> 00:22:45.200
scary.

00:22:45.200 --> 00:22:50.300
And then as the detective
who came on my right shoulder

00:22:50.300 --> 00:22:54.720
and actually ripped
my rotator cuff,

00:22:54.720 --> 00:22:56.630
and this is when
I began to scream.

00:22:56.630 --> 00:22:59.090
It really hurt.

00:22:59.090 --> 00:23:02.390
So why I didn't talk,
and why I talk about now,

00:23:02.390 --> 00:23:04.430
it's never pleasant.

00:23:04.430 --> 00:23:05.490
It's never pleasant.

00:23:05.490 --> 00:23:08.850
And I knew that I know
that they knew that.

00:23:08.850 --> 00:23:12.860
But the tools truth
might be able to help.

00:23:12.860 --> 00:23:18.090
Maybe we can put that to rest.

00:23:18.090 --> 00:23:21.980
And people don't see
that their life is just

00:23:21.980 --> 00:23:25.130
a bowl of peaches and cream.

00:23:25.130 --> 00:23:26.960
Life is a struggle.

00:23:26.960 --> 00:23:29.600
But to go from
here, actually, I am

00:23:29.600 --> 00:23:34.940
convinced that if I would
have never been arrested,

00:23:34.940 --> 00:23:37.760
I would have never
forgiven the Nazis.

00:23:37.760 --> 00:23:40.340
Because from there on--

00:23:40.340 --> 00:23:45.420
I also wanted answers because
my sister was so very ill.

00:23:45.420 --> 00:23:48.230
So I was doing
everything I could

00:23:48.230 --> 00:23:52.490
do to find as much information
about Mengele's experiments.

00:23:52.490 --> 00:23:58.100
And did not end up with
a lot of good results.

00:23:58.100 --> 00:24:03.830
But in order to go on,
we need to really know

00:24:03.830 --> 00:24:06.200
as much as possible.

00:24:06.200 --> 00:24:12.030
And then realizing that
I was not going to get--

00:24:12.030 --> 00:24:15.170
and can you imagine
for one moment,

00:24:15.170 --> 00:24:18.590
I am in the capitol rotunda--

00:24:18.590 --> 00:24:20.270
I want to describe it to you--

00:24:20.270 --> 00:24:27.066
surrounded by all the members
of Congress, by 15 or 100

00:24:27.066 --> 00:24:32.000
to 1,000 survivors,
by the world press,

00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:35.450
probably 1,000 members
of the world press.

00:24:35.450 --> 00:24:39.740
Not anybody got up or
asked, what on earth

00:24:39.740 --> 00:24:41.080
are they doing to her?

00:24:41.080 --> 00:24:45.140
Not anybody ever contacted
me after the arrest.

00:24:45.140 --> 00:24:48.070
Are you alive or dead?

00:24:48.070 --> 00:24:51.810
That was very scary
to me, that that

00:24:51.810 --> 00:24:55.830
could happen, that people
who I expected to help me--

00:24:55.830 --> 00:25:00.660
my fellow survivors, the
government of United States,

00:25:00.660 --> 00:25:01.910
and the press--

00:25:01.910 --> 00:25:03.020
nobody did.

00:25:06.040 --> 00:25:10.160
That made me feel that
from there on, I said,

00:25:10.160 --> 00:25:13.730
I was afraid to
go to Washington.

00:25:13.730 --> 00:25:16.820
But strangely, I'm not
afraid to go to Auschwitz.

00:25:16.820 --> 00:25:18.750
What does that mean?

00:25:18.750 --> 00:25:22.220
That doesn't make any sense.

00:25:22.220 --> 00:25:25.840
And when the
opportunity presented

00:25:25.840 --> 00:25:32.280
itself to meet with the
Nazi doctor in 1993,

00:25:32.280 --> 00:25:34.530
I was very, very nervous.

00:25:34.530 --> 00:25:36.200
I was very worried.

00:25:36.200 --> 00:25:42.030
What I remembered about Nazis,
I wasn't looking forward to it.

00:25:42.030 --> 00:25:46.990
But when I met him, this
was a guy I was scared of,

00:25:46.990 --> 00:25:49.810
and he was treating
me with respect.

00:25:49.810 --> 00:25:53.610
And the people who were supposed
to treat me with respect

00:25:53.610 --> 00:25:56.420
were arresting me
and ignoring me.

00:25:56.420 --> 00:25:58.300
Something didn't end up.

00:25:58.300 --> 00:26:01.135
And that is a way I think
the mind is interesting,

00:26:01.135 --> 00:26:04.210
how it works.

00:26:04.210 --> 00:26:08.200
I don't know if I want to talk
about forgiveness right now.

00:26:08.200 --> 00:26:09.880
SPEAKER 1: No, go--

00:26:09.880 --> 00:26:11.470
yeah, it's the next question.

00:26:11.470 --> 00:26:16.030
EVA KOR: Well, the
idea is that I asked--

00:26:16.030 --> 00:26:18.110
I met with the doctor.

00:26:18.110 --> 00:26:21.960
He was willing to
tell me everything.

00:26:21.960 --> 00:26:27.570
And basically it
was to have a report

00:26:27.570 --> 00:26:30.030
I could take to a
conference in Boston,

00:26:30.030 --> 00:26:33.660
because he was not
willing to go to Boston.

00:26:33.660 --> 00:26:36.780
And the camera people were
wrapping up everything,

00:26:36.780 --> 00:26:38.570
and we were sitting outside.

00:26:38.570 --> 00:26:40.800
It was a nice August afternoon.

00:26:40.800 --> 00:26:44.810
August 20, 1993.

00:26:44.810 --> 00:26:47.740
And I didn't really plan
to ask that question,

00:26:47.740 --> 00:26:51.220
but somehow it
popped into my head.

00:26:51.220 --> 00:26:55.110
Dr. Munch, you
were in Auschwitz.

00:26:55.110 --> 00:26:57.050
Did you ever walk
by the gas chamber?

00:26:57.050 --> 00:26:59.260
Did you ever go inside?

00:26:59.260 --> 00:27:01.055
Do you know how it operates?

00:27:01.055 --> 00:27:04.210
And he said, yes, yes, yes.

00:27:04.210 --> 00:27:07.210
This is a nightmare that I
live with every single day

00:27:07.210 --> 00:27:08.260
of my life.

00:27:08.260 --> 00:27:11.390
And then he went on describing
the operation of the gas

00:27:11.390 --> 00:27:12.010
chamber.

00:27:12.010 --> 00:27:15.580
He said that everybody-- he
was not in the gas chamber.

00:27:15.580 --> 00:27:19.700
He was stationed outside and
looking through a peephole.

00:27:19.700 --> 00:27:21.940
And then everybody was dead.

00:27:21.940 --> 00:27:24.290
I signed their
death certificates.

00:27:24.290 --> 00:27:25.400
No names.

00:27:25.400 --> 00:27:28.180
Just the number of
people that were killed.

00:27:28.180 --> 00:27:31.510
I have never read
about it in any book.

00:27:31.510 --> 00:27:36.670
So I told him that was new
information I didn't know.

00:27:36.670 --> 00:27:42.400
And therefore, I invited him to
go with me to Auschwitz in 1995

00:27:42.400 --> 00:27:45.580
to sign a document at
the ruins of the gas

00:27:45.580 --> 00:27:48.460
chamber in the
company of witnesses,

00:27:48.460 --> 00:27:50.530
just what he told me.

00:27:50.530 --> 00:27:53.080
And I wanted six
witnesses so nobody

00:27:53.080 --> 00:27:57.940
could say later on that he
didn't sign this document.

00:27:57.940 --> 00:28:00.330
And he said, I would love to.

00:28:00.330 --> 00:28:02.380
I was pleased that
it was so easy.

00:28:02.380 --> 00:28:05.970
I got back to Terre Haute.

00:28:05.970 --> 00:28:10.380
And I wanted to thank this
Nazi doctor for his willingness

00:28:10.380 --> 00:28:12.480
to document the gas chamber.

00:28:12.480 --> 00:28:16.770
What I liked about it that
it was not a Jewish person.

00:28:16.770 --> 00:28:20.370
Because Jews are being accused
of inventing the Holocaust.

00:28:20.370 --> 00:28:22.440
It was important
to me that this was

00:28:22.440 --> 00:28:27.270
a Nazi who witnessed it
and was willing to testify.

00:28:27.270 --> 00:28:31.460
And I wanted to thank him,
and that was a strange thing.

00:28:31.460 --> 00:28:35.500
Because I realized thanking the
Nazis, that was a crazy idea.

00:28:35.500 --> 00:28:38.740
So I did not tell
anybody about it,

00:28:38.740 --> 00:28:42.220
because I didn't want my friends
and family to talk me out

00:28:42.220 --> 00:28:43.780
of it.

00:28:43.780 --> 00:28:47.790
So I did not know
how to thank a Nazi.

00:28:47.790 --> 00:28:49.260
And I didn't know where to turn.

00:28:49.260 --> 00:28:55.800
For the 10 months, every day,
I brainstormed by myself.

00:28:55.800 --> 00:29:00.150
And after 10 months, a simple
idea popped into my head.

00:29:00.150 --> 00:29:02.820
How about a letter of
forgiveness from me

00:29:02.820 --> 00:29:05.640
to Dr. Munch.

00:29:05.640 --> 00:29:08.910
I realized that that
was a meaningful gift.

00:29:08.910 --> 00:29:13.350
But what I discovered for
myself was that I had the power

00:29:13.350 --> 00:29:14.700
to forgive.

00:29:14.700 --> 00:29:16.690
No one can give me that power.

00:29:16.690 --> 00:29:18.250
No one can take it away.

00:29:18.250 --> 00:29:22.110
It was all mine to use
in any way I wished.

00:29:22.110 --> 00:29:25.710
And so that is a way
I arrived in Auschwitz

00:29:25.710 --> 00:29:29.320
with Dr. Munch and my children.

00:29:29.320 --> 00:29:32.630
Alex was with me and
my daughter Rena.

00:29:32.630 --> 00:29:38.630
And I don't think that they
really understood how big that

00:29:38.630 --> 00:29:42.230
was for me, to realize
as time goes on--

00:29:42.230 --> 00:29:44.510
and I am doing a lot
more research on it,

00:29:44.510 --> 00:29:48.650
and I am going to write a little
book just about forgiveness,

00:29:48.650 --> 00:29:51.110
my forgiveness.

00:29:51.110 --> 00:29:55.430
Because people do not
understand that accidentally

00:29:55.430 --> 00:30:02.930
I stumbled, in my opinion,
on the cure for war,

00:30:02.930 --> 00:30:05.370
the secret to world peace.

00:30:05.370 --> 00:30:09.680
If every person, or the
majority of the people,

00:30:09.680 --> 00:30:12.410
when they are
hurt, they know how

00:30:12.410 --> 00:30:18.700
to heal themselves by forgiving,
there is no anger in the world.

00:30:18.700 --> 00:30:23.980
People concentrate on getting
along and doing good things

00:30:23.980 --> 00:30:27.670
rather than killing each
other or getting evil.

00:30:27.670 --> 00:30:31.120
And the forgiveness
doesn't hurt anybody.

00:30:31.120 --> 00:30:34.860
It always helps the victims.

00:30:34.860 --> 00:30:36.630
That is not designed to do.

00:30:36.630 --> 00:30:41.760
I did not forgive ultimately
to help Dr. Munch.

00:30:41.760 --> 00:30:45.330
It started out as a
gift to Dr. Munch.

00:30:45.330 --> 00:30:52.040
But it ended up as a
curing of my own pain.

00:30:52.040 --> 00:30:57.481
And many people have contacted
me to tell me the same thing.

00:30:57.481 --> 00:30:59.480
SPEAKER 1: So Ted, you
got to kind of experience

00:30:59.480 --> 00:31:01.950
the other side of somewhat
of a controversial message.

00:31:01.950 --> 00:31:05.510
How, when you talk to the other
twins, the other survivors,

00:31:05.510 --> 00:31:07.930
how did they take to the
[? messes ?] of forgiving

00:31:07.930 --> 00:31:08.450
a Nazi?

00:31:08.450 --> 00:31:09.950
TED GREEN: Well, I
would have to say

00:31:09.950 --> 00:31:14.600
that most survivors, probably
a pretty heavy percentage,

00:31:14.600 --> 00:31:18.200
really, absolutely disagree
with Eva's forgiveness.

00:31:18.200 --> 00:31:21.200
You saw one woman
there, a lovely woman,

00:31:21.200 --> 00:31:23.420
in the trailer,
whose veins were kind

00:31:23.420 --> 00:31:26.690
of popping out of her head,
she was so enraged about it.

00:31:26.690 --> 00:31:30.740
We were able to interview the
only set of twins still alive

00:31:30.740 --> 00:31:32.780
who were with Eva
in her barrack.

00:31:32.780 --> 00:31:36.620
And they have this great
love with Eva and bond.

00:31:36.620 --> 00:31:39.290
But they also adamantly
disagree with her.

00:31:39.290 --> 00:31:41.530
So yeah, that's something
to sit down and take in.

00:31:41.530 --> 00:31:43.750
I think there are two--

00:31:43.750 --> 00:31:46.730
a couple of things, the
main points they have,

00:31:46.730 --> 00:31:50.480
is that how can she
forgive and forget.

00:31:50.480 --> 00:31:52.580
And then that's
just flat-out wrong.

00:31:52.580 --> 00:31:54.710
The last thing she is
doing is forgetting.

00:31:54.710 --> 00:31:57.860
I would say that there is
no other survivor alive

00:31:57.860 --> 00:32:01.580
who is working harder
day to day, year to year,

00:32:01.580 --> 00:32:03.560
to keep the messages
of the Holocaust

00:32:03.560 --> 00:32:07.070
alive as much as this
woman right here.

00:32:07.070 --> 00:32:09.050
They also say that
while forgiveness

00:32:09.050 --> 00:32:13.340
is OK for maybe lesser crimes,
for maybe one on one crimes,

00:32:13.340 --> 00:32:15.410
but the Holocaust,
that's too much,

00:32:15.410 --> 00:32:17.270
that's simply unforgivable.

00:32:17.270 --> 00:32:18.240
I think I can--

00:32:18.240 --> 00:32:21.290
this is what Eva would say
is it's not unforgivable.

00:32:21.290 --> 00:32:23.270
And in fact, in
the documentary, we

00:32:23.270 --> 00:32:27.241
were fortunate to interview
an expert on forgiveness.

00:32:27.241 --> 00:32:28.990
He wrote the book
"Embodying Forgiveness."

00:32:28.990 --> 00:32:32.710
He's the former Dean of
the Duke Divinity School.

00:32:32.710 --> 00:32:36.440
And he says that
for Eva to forgive

00:32:36.440 --> 00:32:39.490
the seemingly unforgivable
proves that it's not

00:32:39.490 --> 00:32:41.300
unforgivable after all.

00:32:41.300 --> 00:32:44.150
That we all sort of have
to look within ourselves

00:32:44.150 --> 00:32:48.380
and try to figure out why
couldn't we forgive something

00:32:48.380 --> 00:32:48.900
that big.

00:32:48.900 --> 00:32:50.290
And it's a tough question.

00:32:50.290 --> 00:32:53.640
And I'm not here to
advocate or not advocate.

00:32:53.640 --> 00:32:55.190
I'm here to chronicle.

00:32:55.190 --> 00:32:57.620
But I will say that
I have also have

00:32:57.620 --> 00:33:02.180
been able to interview so many
people whose lives have been

00:33:02.180 --> 00:33:07.220
changed, in some cases saved,
by Eva through her forgiveness.

00:33:07.220 --> 00:33:09.332
SPEAKER 1: And Ted, what's
next for the project?

00:33:09.332 --> 00:33:10.790
TED GREEN: Well,
it's actually kind

00:33:10.790 --> 00:33:12.040
of an exciting time right now.

00:33:12.040 --> 00:33:13.320
We are in the process of--

00:33:13.320 --> 00:33:17.210
we're negotiating for national
distribution right now.

00:33:17.210 --> 00:33:19.460
We are entering into
lots of film festivals.

00:33:19.460 --> 00:33:21.480
We've already gotten into a few.

00:33:21.480 --> 00:33:25.520
We've received screenings so
far, dozens of screenings,

00:33:25.520 --> 00:33:28.610
from around-- requests
from around the country.

00:33:28.610 --> 00:33:31.400
And one thing I want to say is
we're very proud of-- we just

00:33:31.400 --> 00:33:33.830
released an
educational tool kit,

00:33:33.830 --> 00:33:36.980
which is a cut-down version
of the film-- one hour--

00:33:36.980 --> 00:33:39.910
along with a curriculum
guide that's standards-based,

00:33:39.910 --> 00:33:42.330
and really, really works.

00:33:42.330 --> 00:33:45.020
And we are spreading
that nationwide as well,

00:33:45.020 --> 00:33:47.330
along with the help of
Tanglewood Publishing,

00:33:47.330 --> 00:33:48.950
the publisher of Eva's book.

00:33:48.950 --> 00:33:52.100
So to follow along,
to see our progress,

00:33:52.100 --> 00:33:53.600
and to see clips
of the film and all

00:33:53.600 --> 00:33:56.450
that, we are turning everybody
to our website, which

00:33:56.450 --> 00:34:00.645
is www.thestoryofEva.com.

00:34:00.645 --> 00:34:03.020
SPEAKER 1: So I want to open
it up to audience questions.

00:34:03.020 --> 00:34:05.020
So we have two
microphones on each side.

00:34:05.020 --> 00:34:07.910
While people are lining up, Eva,
I've got a question for you.

00:34:07.910 --> 00:34:09.624
The last couple of
years, you've become

00:34:09.624 --> 00:34:10.790
a little bit of a celebrity.

00:34:10.790 --> 00:34:13.260
You were the Grand
Marshal of the Indy 500.

00:34:13.260 --> 00:34:15.830
You've become friends with
Ray Allen and Motley Crue

00:34:15.830 --> 00:34:17.362
and all kinds of people.

00:34:17.362 --> 00:34:19.070
Who's your favorite
celebrity that you've

00:34:19.070 --> 00:34:20.940
got to meet the last few years?

00:34:20.940 --> 00:34:25.850
EVA KOR: It's a very
incorrect question to ask me.

00:34:25.850 --> 00:34:28.730
I like all celebrities
and actually

00:34:28.730 --> 00:34:32.929
all people who are interested
in learning about the Holocaust,

00:34:32.929 --> 00:34:34.830
learning about forgiveness.

00:34:34.830 --> 00:34:39.350
It is each person
relates to it different.

00:34:39.350 --> 00:34:44.179
Ray Allen is a member of
the US Holocaust Council,

00:34:44.179 --> 00:34:46.400
and he has a special
interest in it.

00:34:46.400 --> 00:34:49.040
Then I met him, this tall guy.

00:34:49.040 --> 00:34:53.120
With all his family, he
came to Miami to my lecture.

00:34:53.120 --> 00:34:57.220
And he was interested
in what I had to say.

00:34:57.220 --> 00:34:59.120
I was very surprised
that he brought

00:34:59.120 --> 00:35:01.520
all of his five children.

00:35:01.520 --> 00:35:06.710
And with Motley Crew it
was strange, very strange.

00:35:06.710 --> 00:35:14.690
Nikki Sixx, his burley hair
appeared above my shoulder,

00:35:14.690 --> 00:35:18.140
as he was putting his
arm on my shoulder.

00:35:18.140 --> 00:35:22.100
And I saw this dangling
arm with all the tattoos.

00:35:22.100 --> 00:35:24.090
And I didn't even
know where on earth I

00:35:24.090 --> 00:35:27.980
was, because I just turned
around on the red carpet

00:35:27.980 --> 00:35:29.390
to find the right direction.

00:35:29.390 --> 00:35:30.140
You were there.

00:35:30.140 --> 00:35:31.250
TED GREEN: I was there.

00:35:31.250 --> 00:35:33.090
EVA KOR: And I'm
trying to figure out

00:35:33.090 --> 00:35:35.300
what on earth is happening.

00:35:35.300 --> 00:35:40.560
And he smiles with his big
mustache and lots of hair.

00:35:40.560 --> 00:35:42.450
"Hi, sweetie."

00:35:42.450 --> 00:35:45.020
I'm saying, well, I'm
on the red carpet.

00:35:45.020 --> 00:35:45.640
What do I do?

00:35:45.640 --> 00:35:46.350
I said hi.

00:35:49.400 --> 00:35:52.733
And then everybody told
me he was this famous.

00:35:52.733 --> 00:35:57.390
Well, I have texted to him
later on, a year later, I said,

00:35:57.390 --> 00:35:58.790
you scared me to death.

00:35:58.790 --> 00:36:00.830
Lucky that you had a nice smile.

00:36:00.830 --> 00:36:02.310
That put me at ease.

00:36:02.310 --> 00:36:04.970
I mean, I did not--

00:36:04.970 --> 00:36:09.380
I expected to meet media,
maybe in suits or at least

00:36:09.380 --> 00:36:10.580
more civilized looking.

00:36:13.697 --> 00:36:15.530
TED GREEN: You know,
what you're leaving out

00:36:15.530 --> 00:36:19.190
is right after the event, she
tweeted him and said, how do I

00:36:19.190 --> 00:36:21.260
get to be a rock star like you?

00:36:21.260 --> 00:36:22.874
And he responded--

00:36:22.874 --> 00:36:24.530
EVA KOR: "Well,
sweetie, you have

00:36:24.530 --> 00:36:27.200
been a rock star all your life.

00:36:27.200 --> 00:36:29.720
You have inspired many people."

00:36:29.720 --> 00:36:33.780
So then I appeared on his
radio show about a year ago.

00:36:33.780 --> 00:36:36.530
But it is-- here we are.

00:36:36.530 --> 00:36:38.330
I mean, lots of celebrities.

00:36:38.330 --> 00:36:42.410
I need all the celebrities,
I need all the everybody

00:36:42.410 --> 00:36:46.820
to join in that effort
to create a better

00:36:46.820 --> 00:36:49.940
understanding of how
we can get along,

00:36:49.940 --> 00:36:52.940
and how we can heal ourselves.

00:36:52.940 --> 00:36:54.390
Nobody can heal you.

00:36:54.390 --> 00:36:57.200
You have to work at
healing yourself.

00:36:57.200 --> 00:37:04.490
Because it's a personal
journey of actually addressing

00:37:04.490 --> 00:37:07.790
what happened, and coming
out on the other side feeling

00:37:07.790 --> 00:37:11.690
that you have, I have,
everybody has the right

00:37:11.690 --> 00:37:16.470
to be free of any pain that
anybody imposed upon us.

00:37:16.470 --> 00:37:21.740
That the survivors don't
agree they are wrong.

00:37:21.740 --> 00:37:26.750
They keep telling me, you
can't forgive Nazi atrocities.

00:37:26.750 --> 00:37:29.090
Did God say that?

00:37:29.090 --> 00:37:33.080
Did God decide that Nazis
are too big to forgive them?

00:37:33.080 --> 00:37:35.540
That is man's interpretation.

00:37:35.540 --> 00:37:38.736
Why can't you forgive the
big crime that really hurt,

00:37:38.736 --> 00:37:41.910
when you can forgive
the small crimes.

00:37:41.910 --> 00:37:45.020
I think we should
forgive all crimes,

00:37:45.020 --> 00:37:47.750
not for the sake
of the perpetrator,

00:37:47.750 --> 00:37:50.370
but for the sake of
healing ourselves.

00:37:50.370 --> 00:37:54.200
And once we are
healed, we hope that we

00:37:54.200 --> 00:37:59.055
can teach the perpetrators
to heal themselves too.

00:37:59.055 --> 00:38:01.430
TED GREEN: Could I jump in
here with one little shameless

00:38:01.430 --> 00:38:02.750
promotion, or another
shameless promotion?

00:38:02.750 --> 00:38:03.666
SPEAKER 1: Yeah, sure.

00:38:03.666 --> 00:38:07.040
TED GREEN: To join Eva's team,
we have actually started that

00:38:07.040 --> 00:38:09.500
with hashtag #TeamEva.

00:38:09.500 --> 00:38:13.520
Anybody who wants to sort
of follow along and join

00:38:13.520 --> 00:38:16.160
with this crusade
she's on, please

00:38:16.160 --> 00:38:17.230
look at hashtag #TeamEva.

00:38:19.790 --> 00:38:22.220
EVA KOR: I want to jump
in also with something,

00:38:22.220 --> 00:38:25.640
because I have an app.

00:38:25.640 --> 00:38:32.720
It's called Eva-- capital
E-V-A without any space,

00:38:32.720 --> 00:38:37.460
and then capital K-O-R.
You can click on it.

00:38:37.460 --> 00:38:39.860
You get at least three lectures.

00:38:39.860 --> 00:38:41.660
You can choose what
you want to hear.

00:38:41.660 --> 00:38:43.940
And you get some
other information.

00:38:43.940 --> 00:38:46.560
You can bring it up on your
iPhone anytime you want to.

00:38:49.240 --> 00:38:50.270
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:38:50.270 --> 00:38:53.540
First of all, thank you
for coming to Google.

00:38:53.540 --> 00:38:56.210
I have a question
about forgiveness

00:38:56.210 --> 00:38:59.300
and how it might
be different when

00:38:59.300 --> 00:39:01.700
the person you are forgiving,
or the people that you

00:39:01.700 --> 00:39:06.990
are forgiving, feel bad
versus don't feel bad.

00:39:06.990 --> 00:39:10.880
So in the case of the
doctor who you spoke with

00:39:10.880 --> 00:39:14.840
and who expressed to you that
he felt terrible every day,

00:39:14.840 --> 00:39:19.460
it seems like that would aid in
being able to feel forgiveness,

00:39:19.460 --> 00:39:24.590
whereas presumably
there are Nazis who

00:39:24.590 --> 00:39:26.330
still are alive who might not--

00:39:26.330 --> 00:39:29.780
who don't feel that
way, who don't feel bad.

00:39:29.780 --> 00:39:32.780
How do you feel forgiveness
for those people?

00:39:34.895 --> 00:39:37.170
EVA KOR: Because of
forgiveness, if we understand it

00:39:37.170 --> 00:39:38.920
correctly today--

00:39:38.920 --> 00:39:44.070
I agree with you that when it
happened it was helpful to me

00:39:44.070 --> 00:39:50.500
that he was feeling sorry and
remorse in what he has done.

00:39:50.500 --> 00:39:53.130
If he would have yelled
at me and treated me

00:39:53.130 --> 00:39:55.320
like a good old
Nazi in the camp,

00:39:55.320 --> 00:39:56.880
I probably would
not have not been

00:39:56.880 --> 00:40:01.560
able to reach a
forgiveness or even want

00:40:01.560 --> 00:40:03.370
to deal with him at all.

00:40:03.370 --> 00:40:07.290
So these steps that happened,
happened accidentally.

00:40:07.290 --> 00:40:13.080
But once I realized what the
power that the forgiveness has,

00:40:13.080 --> 00:40:14.820
I do not care.

00:40:14.820 --> 00:40:17.640
I am sorry if they
feel still angry,

00:40:17.640 --> 00:40:20.730
and they want to
create problems.

00:40:20.730 --> 00:40:21.930
I have the right.

00:40:21.930 --> 00:40:27.685
And it's a fairly selfish thing,
but it does not hurt anybody.

00:40:27.685 --> 00:40:31.510
It helps everybody, that
I do have the human right.

00:40:31.510 --> 00:40:34.260
And actually, I am
trying to get the United

00:40:34.260 --> 00:40:37.710
Nations to change
their Universal

00:40:37.710 --> 00:40:39.540
Declaration to Human Rights.

00:40:39.540 --> 00:40:44.110
That every human being on
the face of this earth--

00:40:44.110 --> 00:40:46.460
an addendum that I
would like to add--

00:40:46.460 --> 00:40:52.080
has the human right to be happy
and to be free of the pain

00:40:52.080 --> 00:40:55.110
that anybody imposed
us in the past.

00:40:55.110 --> 00:40:59.100
And we can do it if we
so choose by forgiving.

00:40:59.100 --> 00:41:01.710
So the ideal of
forgiveness, I would

00:41:01.710 --> 00:41:05.760
like it to be a human right
included into the declaration.

00:41:05.760 --> 00:41:11.130
But the fact that they
are still mean and nasty,

00:41:11.130 --> 00:41:15.420
it's more that I have the
need to forgive them, and thus

00:41:15.420 --> 00:41:18.990
remove them from my agenda.

00:41:18.990 --> 00:41:19.908
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:41:19.908 --> 00:41:22.000
EVA KOR: You're welcome.

00:41:22.000 --> 00:41:22.670
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:41:22.670 --> 00:41:23.190
Thank you.

00:41:23.190 --> 00:41:25.880
So my question is, do you
consider the forgiveness

00:41:25.880 --> 00:41:28.070
to the start of the
healing process,

00:41:28.070 --> 00:41:31.220
or do you consider possibility
of the healing started before,

00:41:31.220 --> 00:41:32.930
even before forgiveness,
and forgiveness

00:41:32.930 --> 00:41:35.950
being a stage of that.

00:41:35.950 --> 00:41:38.626
EVA KOR: I'm not
sure that I follow.

00:41:38.626 --> 00:41:40.500
TED GREEN: Do you need
to forgive-- let's see

00:41:40.500 --> 00:41:41.583
if I'm hearing this right.

00:41:41.583 --> 00:41:43.280
Do you need to be
able to forgive

00:41:43.280 --> 00:41:44.750
before you can start healing?

00:41:44.750 --> 00:41:47.754
Or can you heal sometimes
before you forgive?

00:41:47.754 --> 00:41:48.920
AUDIENCE: Yes, that's right.

00:41:48.920 --> 00:41:50.270
EVA KOR: You have to forgive.

00:41:50.270 --> 00:41:53.630
Because by forgiving,
you are removing

00:41:53.630 --> 00:41:56.370
all the pain and the burden.

00:41:56.370 --> 00:41:58.070
Although, one more thing.

00:41:58.070 --> 00:42:02.210
Forgiveness gives you
power over your life.

00:42:02.210 --> 00:42:05.990
And most victims when
they are victimized

00:42:05.990 --> 00:42:08.240
and after, they
feel they have they

00:42:08.240 --> 00:42:12.120
have no power to
change their life.

00:42:12.120 --> 00:42:13.290
Many people.

00:42:13.290 --> 00:42:14.840
So what can I do about it?

00:42:14.840 --> 00:42:16.470
That's it.

00:42:16.470 --> 00:42:22.520
But by having that power that
we all do, we exist in every--

00:42:22.520 --> 00:42:26.870
even in wars where there is a
lot more problems than here,

00:42:26.870 --> 00:42:28.610
we do have the power to forgive.

00:42:28.610 --> 00:42:30.450
We don't have to make it public.

00:42:30.450 --> 00:42:32.590
But we know that we forgive.

00:42:32.590 --> 00:42:36.830
Therefore, the burden of pain
is removed from our shoulder.

00:42:36.830 --> 00:42:38.525
And this is when
the healing starts.

00:42:44.020 --> 00:42:47.960
AUDIENCE: Hi, thank you
for coming to speak to us.

00:42:47.960 --> 00:42:51.170
As you know, we are
technology builders.

00:42:51.170 --> 00:42:56.180
We build telephones and
communications systems,

00:42:56.180 --> 00:42:59.630
information tools.

00:42:59.630 --> 00:43:02.420
You've been living a
life of great purpose

00:43:02.420 --> 00:43:07.340
through a time of great
technological transformation

00:43:07.340 --> 00:43:09.200
through the 20th century.

00:43:09.200 --> 00:43:12.440
I wonder if you can
think of any time

00:43:12.440 --> 00:43:16.460
maybe recently, maybe
a long time ago,

00:43:16.460 --> 00:43:20.270
of a technology that
helped you achieve

00:43:20.270 --> 00:43:29.050
your purposes in your work for
remembrance and for justice

00:43:29.050 --> 00:43:30.942
and for forgiveness.

00:43:30.942 --> 00:43:33.790
EVA KOR: Well, it's an
interesting question.

00:43:33.790 --> 00:43:36.520
I do not agree with
the word justice.

00:43:36.520 --> 00:43:38.110
Only just punishment.

00:43:38.110 --> 00:43:41.770
But I don't think there is
really justice in the world.

00:43:41.770 --> 00:43:47.470
But purpose, I mean,
technology, I am not sure

00:43:47.470 --> 00:43:50.710
if I am going to answer it.

00:43:50.710 --> 00:43:55.630
How can I help using
technology in my philosophy

00:43:55.630 --> 00:43:58.210
of forgiveness?

00:43:58.210 --> 00:44:01.940
The Shoah Foundation
created holograms.

00:44:01.940 --> 00:44:04.000
And I have a hologram of my own.

00:44:04.000 --> 00:44:06.240
There are certain
survivors who were

00:44:06.240 --> 00:44:11.380
recorded for hologram,
interactive holograms.

00:44:11.380 --> 00:44:16.450
I think the idea that we
can spread the knowledge

00:44:16.450 --> 00:44:20.720
and information
that each of us has.

00:44:20.720 --> 00:44:23.560
And we can interact,
and by interacting, we

00:44:23.560 --> 00:44:28.810
can help other people maybe
realize that they can do it too

00:44:28.810 --> 00:44:29.980
in their own way.

00:44:29.980 --> 00:44:34.630
I don't think that everybody
will do healing and forgiveness

00:44:34.630 --> 00:44:35.620
in my way--

00:44:35.620 --> 00:44:36.460
own way.

00:44:36.460 --> 00:44:40.210
Technology-- I mean, he
created a wonderful film

00:44:40.210 --> 00:44:43.270
with a lot of
technological parts.

00:44:43.270 --> 00:44:47.020
And that we are also going to
make available for schools.

00:44:49.706 --> 00:44:51.540
I do not know--

00:44:51.540 --> 00:44:54.040
I will tell you one thing
that I'm fascinated.

00:44:54.040 --> 00:44:56.840
I am fascinated by
all these questions.

00:44:56.840 --> 00:45:00.580
Do you know that the
most interesting part

00:45:00.580 --> 00:45:04.956
in the human body is the brain?

00:45:04.956 --> 00:45:09.220
Everything that
we come up with--

00:45:09.220 --> 00:45:13.310
I mean, I'm amazed how long
ago, over 100 years ago,

00:45:13.310 --> 00:45:15.280
people came up with ideas.

00:45:15.280 --> 00:45:17.930
Columbus discovered America.

00:45:17.930 --> 00:45:21.460
The curiosities that we have.

00:45:21.460 --> 00:45:23.780
We can do anything.

00:45:23.780 --> 00:45:27.670
Therefore, I am convinced
that we can heal

00:45:27.670 --> 00:45:29.500
all the problems in the world.

00:45:29.500 --> 00:45:32.920
If I just gave you
an assignment here,

00:45:32.920 --> 00:45:37.560
every single one of you,
if you ever are bored,

00:45:37.560 --> 00:45:40.540
just think for 10
minutes, what can I

00:45:40.540 --> 00:45:43.940
do to make the world better?

00:45:43.940 --> 00:45:46.520
I don't care how little it is.

00:45:46.520 --> 00:45:49.610
But every single one
of you can do something

00:45:49.610 --> 00:45:51.780
to make the world better.

00:45:51.780 --> 00:45:56.940
Now, if we can use
technology to enhance that,

00:45:56.940 --> 00:46:00.310
that is where the
power of technology is.

00:46:00.310 --> 00:46:01.560
AUDIENCE: Thank you very much.

00:46:01.560 --> 00:46:03.480
TED GREEN: Can I jump
in on this one as well?

00:46:03.480 --> 00:46:04.896
I don't think
you're going to find

00:46:04.896 --> 00:46:08.471
many more technology savvy
84-year-olds than this women

00:46:08.471 --> 00:46:08.970
right here.

00:46:08.970 --> 00:46:10.590
I mean, she's got an app.

00:46:10.590 --> 00:46:12.570
She tweets all the time.

00:46:12.570 --> 00:46:16.550
And actually, she delivers
her lectures via Skype.

00:46:16.550 --> 00:46:19.120
She gets requests from
all over the world.

00:46:19.120 --> 00:46:21.810
So she really has
been, you know,

00:46:21.810 --> 00:46:24.120
back in the days
in the 1980s, when

00:46:24.120 --> 00:46:26.940
all of your typed-written
letters to every publication

00:46:26.940 --> 00:46:30.510
around the country just asking
them to help with your story.

00:46:30.510 --> 00:46:32.070
And here you are
and she is really

00:46:32.070 --> 00:46:33.990
reaching all around the world.

00:46:33.990 --> 00:46:36.370
EVA KOR: And I found my
typewriter, if I'm moving,

00:46:36.370 --> 00:46:38.580
the old typewriter I
found in the garage.

00:46:38.580 --> 00:46:39.508
TED GREEN: All right.

00:46:42.772 --> 00:46:44.230
AUDIENCE: Hi, first
of all, my name

00:46:44.230 --> 00:46:46.313
is Rina like your daughter's
name. that's really--

00:46:46.313 --> 00:46:47.560
EVA KOR: Oh, wonderful.

00:46:47.560 --> 00:46:49.900
AUDIENCE: Thank you
so much for coming.

00:46:49.900 --> 00:46:54.120
I wanted to ask so in terms of
the Holocaust, what happened

00:46:54.120 --> 00:46:56.200
overall, like a
genocide and whatnot,

00:46:56.200 --> 00:46:58.750
do you think that
we, as a globe,

00:46:58.750 --> 00:47:03.460
have learned from
that terrible event,

00:47:03.460 --> 00:47:08.830
or do you think that
there's still more to learn?

00:47:08.830 --> 00:47:13.450
EVA KOR: I think that
technology and communication

00:47:13.450 --> 00:47:17.900
and the internet and
I will tell you why.

00:47:17.900 --> 00:47:20.560
For instance, as
we sit here, there

00:47:20.560 --> 00:47:25.150
are many people in the world who
are suffering, lack of freedom,

00:47:25.150 --> 00:47:28.290
lack of food, lack
of many things.

00:47:28.290 --> 00:47:33.640
But it was New Year's
Eve, and I said, well,

00:47:33.640 --> 00:47:35.410
I am not going to
go anywhere, but I

00:47:35.410 --> 00:47:37.510
want to do something unique.

00:47:37.510 --> 00:47:40.140
So I was going to help--

00:47:40.140 --> 00:47:42.850
the Iranian issue
was on the news.

00:47:42.850 --> 00:47:45.040
They talked about the protests.

00:47:45.040 --> 00:47:51.250
Those people are living in
theocracy without any freedom.

00:47:51.250 --> 00:47:55.030
It's hard for us to understand
because in the United States,

00:47:55.030 --> 00:47:59.370
we really have the most freedom
that most people would have.

00:47:59.370 --> 00:48:02.080
Economically, it's
very important,

00:48:02.080 --> 00:48:05.470
because if you don't have food,
you cannot be very free, right?

00:48:05.470 --> 00:48:07.210
If you don't have money to buy.

00:48:07.210 --> 00:48:12.970
So we can, all of
us, do something

00:48:12.970 --> 00:48:17.170
and in helping other
people in preventing--

00:48:17.170 --> 00:48:22.390
I mean, how on earth that
Iran was able to protest?

00:48:22.390 --> 00:48:23.020
The internet.

00:48:23.020 --> 00:48:26.340
So I tweeted.

00:48:26.340 --> 00:48:27.490
I tweeted.

00:48:27.490 --> 00:48:28.560
I did the following.

00:48:28.560 --> 00:48:34.740
I said 73, years ago, we
were dying in the Nazi camps,

00:48:34.740 --> 00:48:36.350
and the world was silent.

00:48:39.690 --> 00:48:43.440
And I got about 26 responses.

00:48:43.440 --> 00:48:45.540
I didn't like it.

00:48:45.540 --> 00:48:49.940
So I said, 73 years ago,
I was dying in Auschwitz,

00:48:49.940 --> 00:48:51.520
and the world was silent.

00:48:51.520 --> 00:48:54.060
And I no longer can be silent.

00:48:54.060 --> 00:48:59.250
I want you to join with me
and tweet for freedom of Iran.

00:48:59.250 --> 00:49:04.350
I got 17,000 responses.

00:49:04.350 --> 00:49:05.640
So it pays to be dramatic.

00:49:08.160 --> 00:49:16.170
But also the fact that they
entered me in direct mail,

00:49:16.170 --> 00:49:18.930
they said, nobody
has their stories.

00:49:18.930 --> 00:49:21.210
They didn't know
if their stories

00:49:21.210 --> 00:49:23.380
were carried by the media.

00:49:23.380 --> 00:49:30.800
And me tweeting helped them
find out that we knew about it.

00:49:30.800 --> 00:49:32.460
Of course, they were arrested.

00:49:32.460 --> 00:49:34.680
I don't know what their
destiny is right now.

00:49:34.680 --> 00:49:36.020
But I don't think--

00:49:36.020 --> 00:49:38.310
here and there I
get some direct mail

00:49:38.310 --> 00:49:42.170
that we are still
planning something.

00:49:42.170 --> 00:49:46.120
So this is a way I have
a little bit of doubt

00:49:46.120 --> 00:49:49.940
that easily it
can be pulled off.

00:49:49.940 --> 00:49:54.920
Because direct mail,
direct message,

00:49:54.920 --> 00:49:57.740
cannot completely be eradicated.

00:49:57.740 --> 00:50:02.480
The technology is
helping break through.

00:50:02.480 --> 00:50:04.980
That people have not
learned their lesson,

00:50:04.980 --> 00:50:06.110
that is another tragedy.

00:50:12.860 --> 00:50:14.720
AUDIENCE: Thank you, Eva.

00:50:14.720 --> 00:50:19.970
You seem to have an immense
liveliness and vitality.

00:50:19.970 --> 00:50:24.200
And I just wonder where
do you get it from?

00:50:24.200 --> 00:50:25.550
What drives you?

00:50:25.550 --> 00:50:27.980
EVA KOR: Well, then
Mengele stood by my bed

00:50:27.980 --> 00:50:31.160
and said that I had
only two weeks to live,

00:50:31.160 --> 00:50:34.160
I was going to prove him wrong.

00:50:34.160 --> 00:50:37.730
And I had been trying to prove
the world wrong ever since.

00:50:37.730 --> 00:50:40.490
I don't know.

00:50:40.490 --> 00:50:44.930
I feel I was in the
hospital a year ago in May,

00:50:44.930 --> 00:50:47.870
and I was supposed to
give the big speech,

00:50:47.870 --> 00:50:53.390
that it was a terrific
speech, about medicine

00:50:53.390 --> 00:50:55.280
and law and the Holocaust.

00:50:55.280 --> 00:50:57.740
OK, that's combined everything.

00:50:57.740 --> 00:51:00.750
And I worked very hard on it.

00:51:00.750 --> 00:51:03.380
And I was rushed into
the emergency room

00:51:03.380 --> 00:51:05.600
for not being able--

00:51:05.600 --> 00:51:07.490
my heart was in big trouble.

00:51:07.490 --> 00:51:11.810
It wasn't beating
more than 0 to 40.

00:51:11.810 --> 00:51:15.590
And he was there at
the emergency room.

00:51:15.590 --> 00:51:20.600
I said, Ted, this is the
best speech I ever wrote.

00:51:20.600 --> 00:51:22.360
He said, I talked
to the doctors.

00:51:22.360 --> 00:51:27.350
Can I get two hours
off to give my speech?

00:51:27.350 --> 00:51:31.680
And they said, no, what if you
die while you give the speech

00:51:31.680 --> 00:51:33.590
and we don't have the equipment.

00:51:33.590 --> 00:51:37.430
I said, oh, god, that too.

00:51:37.430 --> 00:51:40.160
So Ted recorded it.

00:51:40.160 --> 00:51:43.580
And then I rolled into
the operating room

00:51:43.580 --> 00:51:48.050
to get my pacemaker,
and my recording

00:51:48.050 --> 00:51:50.700
got a standing ovation.

00:51:50.700 --> 00:51:53.000
But I didn't meet Elena Kagan.

00:51:53.000 --> 00:51:55.047
So she was in the audience.

00:51:55.047 --> 00:51:55.880
I couldn't meet her.

00:51:55.880 --> 00:51:59.399
I said maybe she would come to
the hospital, but she didn't.

00:51:59.399 --> 00:52:01.190
TED GREEN: It was
actually really something

00:52:01.190 --> 00:52:03.030
because they were the
co-keynote speakers.

00:52:03.030 --> 00:52:05.660
And I will have to say, no
offense to the Supreme Court

00:52:05.660 --> 00:52:08.480
Justice, but Eva's
taped speech got

00:52:08.480 --> 00:52:12.650
a much bigger round of applause
than Elena Kagan's did.

00:52:12.650 --> 00:52:15.401
EVA KOR: So where do I--

00:52:15.401 --> 00:52:16.710
I don't really know.

00:52:16.710 --> 00:52:18.290
I think some of it is genetic.

00:52:18.290 --> 00:52:21.140
Most of it probably
comes from my mother

00:52:21.140 --> 00:52:24.242
who I don't think
she ever thought

00:52:24.242 --> 00:52:26.090
she would be living
in a big farm

00:52:26.090 --> 00:52:29.360
in a godforsaken little village.

00:52:29.360 --> 00:52:33.290
And she found joy and
happiness in what she could.

00:52:33.290 --> 00:52:35.210
And she loved her children.

00:52:35.210 --> 00:52:38.310
And she loved being
the woman that she was.

00:52:38.310 --> 00:52:43.140
As she was arguing with my
father about her [INAUDIBLE]

00:52:43.140 --> 00:52:45.540
little daughters,
because my father--

00:52:45.540 --> 00:52:48.530
we were religious,
very, Orthodox Jews.

00:52:48.530 --> 00:52:50.600
And my father said,
oh, the girl just

00:52:50.600 --> 00:52:53.390
need to get married and
have babies and that is.

00:52:53.390 --> 00:52:57.530
My mother said, no, my girls
are going to get an education.

00:52:57.530 --> 00:53:00.830
And she never gave up on that.

00:53:00.830 --> 00:53:04.550
So as I was going to
college for 11 years,

00:53:04.550 --> 00:53:08.330
every time I was struggling,
the voice of my mother

00:53:08.330 --> 00:53:11.230
was ringing in my
ears, "My children

00:53:11.230 --> 00:53:13.310
are going to get an education."

00:53:13.310 --> 00:53:16.490
And her vitality,
and her joy, she

00:53:16.490 --> 00:53:21.740
would iron my father's
shirt with an iron

00:53:21.740 --> 00:53:24.410
that had the charcoal in it.

00:53:24.410 --> 00:53:27.980
And she would put on the
radio to listen to the radio.

00:53:27.980 --> 00:53:30.740
She was happy doing
what she was doing.

00:53:30.740 --> 00:53:34.910
So find happiness
in any situation.

00:53:34.910 --> 00:53:38.500
There is always-- you
can make your life happy

00:53:38.500 --> 00:53:43.670
even when things look
desperate or not very good.

00:53:43.670 --> 00:53:45.980
Find joy in something.

00:53:45.980 --> 00:53:50.030
And I find joy in the fact
that I get up every morning,

00:53:50.030 --> 00:53:51.620
and I say, I'm still alive.

00:53:51.620 --> 00:53:53.090
Ah, that's very good.

00:53:55.800 --> 00:53:57.890
And then I see what
can I do good--

00:53:57.890 --> 00:53:59.960
what good can I do today?

00:53:59.960 --> 00:54:04.860
And that, right away,
puts me in a good mood.

00:54:04.860 --> 00:54:08.049
SPEAKER 1: We have time for
one more quick question.

00:54:08.049 --> 00:54:10.090
AUDIENCE: I was really
struck by a comment by Ted

00:54:10.090 --> 00:54:12.160
earlier where you
mentioned that there

00:54:12.160 --> 00:54:13.660
have been so many
Holocaust stories,

00:54:13.660 --> 00:54:16.240
so why is this one different.

00:54:16.240 --> 00:54:18.640
The reason that that
struck me is recent surveys

00:54:18.640 --> 00:54:20.762
have shown that as many
as 2/3 of millennials

00:54:20.762 --> 00:54:21.970
don't know what Auschwitz is.

00:54:21.970 --> 00:54:24.710
40% of Americans
don't know what it is.

00:54:24.710 --> 00:54:26.850
So with all those stories
that have been told,

00:54:26.850 --> 00:54:27.850
what are we doing wrong?

00:54:27.850 --> 00:54:30.920
And why aren't those stories
resonating and spreading?

00:54:30.920 --> 00:54:32.440
EVA KOR: That is--

00:54:32.440 --> 00:54:34.610
I don't know if I
can answer that.

00:54:34.610 --> 00:54:38.620
I think that the
curriculum in schools

00:54:38.620 --> 00:54:44.650
have to include the idea
that history is important.

00:54:44.650 --> 00:54:48.220
We are the product of the past.

00:54:48.220 --> 00:54:53.030
And we have to rely on what
happened before to go forward.

00:54:53.030 --> 00:54:55.540
This country was
founded, and we have

00:54:55.540 --> 00:54:57.850
to learn the history
of this country.

00:54:57.850 --> 00:55:02.830
So many Americans have
died in World War II.

00:55:02.830 --> 00:55:05.820
So many millions of people
died in World War II.

00:55:05.820 --> 00:55:08.830
That has to be a pretty
big event in the world

00:55:08.830 --> 00:55:12.700
to have a bigger chapter
in the high school

00:55:12.700 --> 00:55:14.650
and junior high school books.

00:55:14.650 --> 00:55:17.260
And why doesn't it?

00:55:17.260 --> 00:55:19.550
Because it is an
important chapter.

00:55:19.550 --> 00:55:22.520
And what do we learn from it?

00:55:22.520 --> 00:55:25.510
I am hoping that if I
am successful enough

00:55:25.510 --> 00:55:30.730
with Ted and with what we are
doing, that I can stimulate

00:55:30.730 --> 00:55:33.460
more interest for more schools.

00:55:33.460 --> 00:55:36.350
Because the schools are
controlled by school board,

00:55:36.350 --> 00:55:39.050
and they decide
their curriculum.

00:55:39.050 --> 00:55:40.120
So we are learning.

00:55:40.120 --> 00:55:44.290
With my publisher, I have
been giving lot of lectures

00:55:44.290 --> 00:55:49.390
to school board and
[? schools ?] to adopt my book.

00:55:49.390 --> 00:55:52.840
And once they adopt my book,
they learn a little bit more

00:55:52.840 --> 00:55:54.220
to teach it.

00:55:54.220 --> 00:55:55.900
And it's a along--

00:55:55.900 --> 00:55:56.980
it's a big effort.

00:55:56.980 --> 00:55:59.640
It's not simple.

00:55:59.640 --> 00:56:04.030
But I think your point is
very well made, that we

00:56:04.030 --> 00:56:06.340
need to make a bigger effort.

00:56:06.340 --> 00:56:07.450
And all of us.

00:56:07.450 --> 00:56:08.650
Not only me.

00:56:08.650 --> 00:56:11.560
So I ask you to join me.

00:56:11.560 --> 00:56:13.690
AUDIENCE: OK, thank you.

00:56:13.690 --> 00:56:15.890
SPEAKER 1: So Ted, Eva,
thank you for being here.

00:56:15.890 --> 00:56:17.800
Thank you for
sharing your story.

00:56:17.800 --> 00:56:20.150

00:56:21.250 --> 00:56:24.130
And so thanks for your time.

00:56:24.130 --> 00:56:26.580
