00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:06.030
Superman has been able to focus his heat and
X-ray vision to microscopic levels since 2001,

00:00:06.030 --> 00:00:09.800
but it’s only thanks to recent advancements
in “molecular imaging” that this is moving

00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:11.460
from comics to medicine.

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:15.760
There are lots of different ways doctors look
inside your body.MRIs let us view structures

00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:19.249
based on water content, and X-rays based on
tissue density.

00:00:19.249 --> 00:00:24.050
And, while this can give us beautiful anatomical
information, the standard techniques are quite

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:27.150
limited in what they can tell us about a given
structure.

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:32.052
For example, mammograms use low-energy X-rays
to produce images of breast tissue so a doctor

00:00:32.052 --> 00:00:33.790
can check for any lurking tumors.

00:00:33.790 --> 00:00:36.770
But they’re not a perfect test by any means.

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:41.740
Up to 50% of women have dense breast tissue
that makes it difficult to get a clear image

00:00:41.740 --> 00:00:45.210
and, consequently, there are lots of false
positive results.

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:50.940
One study estimated as many as 1 in 3 women
are initially told they have an abnormal result,

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:55.000
only to find there’s no cancer after repeat
or more sophisticated tests

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:59.360
And,on top of that, the more sophisticated
tests we do have, like MRIs, they require

00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:04.300
an injection to make the target tissues stand
out, and that means tons of sterile tools,

00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:08.729
trained professionals to do the injection,
and extra time at the hospital for the patient.

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:15.409
But, a new study offers what could be a better
solution… a technique called molecular imaging,

00:01:15.409 --> 00:01:19.490
paired with a different way to deliver the
dye -- a simple pill.

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:24.010
Molecular imaging isn’t going to give us
superhuman sight, buuut it CAN make it easier

00:01:24.010 --> 00:01:26.889
for doctors to detect tumors during screening
tests.

00:01:26.889 --> 00:01:31.850
It uses specially designed dyes to illuminate
different tissues based on their biochemical

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:36.320
properties, giving an extra layer of information
about what you’re looking at.

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:40.060
This new technique took advantage of the fact
that cells in a breast cancer tumor have a

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:42.959
lot of a protein receptor called integrin.

00:01:42.959 --> 00:01:47.159
Integrins are found in cells all over the
body so this type of dye wasn’t totally

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:53.350
exclusive to the tumor cells, but it did let
them detect tumors as small as 2 cm in mice.

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:54.350
Which is pretty small.

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:56.990
The thing is, it’s based on a pill.

00:01:56.990 --> 00:02:01.119
And whenever something is ingested instead
of injected it means you have to worry about

00:02:01.119 --> 00:02:05.410
whether it’ll get absorbed by the gut into
the bloodstream where it can travel to go

00:02:05.410 --> 00:02:06.659
do its business.

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:10.060
And while they didn’t have as high of doses
as they would’ve hoped because of all these

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:15.030
metabolic processes, the researchers could
still detect breast cancer tumors and some

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:18.620
support cells in mice.- No injections required.

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:23.400
As we continue to identify biomarkers of aggressive
tumors, this would mean that screening tests

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:27.970
using molecular imaging would not only be
able to check if a mass is present -- they

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:31.920
could also give insight as to whether it’s
benign or something more worrisome that needs

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:33.560
to be removed right away.

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:37.950
Since molecular imaging is less confounded
by the density of tissue, the hope is that

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:40.890
it would have higher accuracy than the current
standard.

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:45.340
While this still needs to be tested in humans
-- and with dyes for different targets -- this

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:51.040
type of pill is inexpensive, estimated by
the authors at about $1/dose, and it’d be

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:55.080
a big improvement over the current standard
in terms of accuracy and efficiency.

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:59.840
So when it comes to scanning inside our bodies,
there’s still a lot to learn.

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:03.940
Mammograms are the current standard for screening
tests, and the American Cancer Society recommends

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:09.460
once women reach 45 they start getting them.But,
I don’t know about you -- I’m terrified

00:03:09.460 --> 00:03:12.930
of needles so I’d pick a pill over an injection
any day.

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:17.230
For more medical mysteries,
check out this video Julian did about surgeries

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:20.680
that might not work at all -- placebo surgeries!

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:25.620
Oh and one last thing: the dye used in this
study was one that already existed -- it was

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:29.900
made by a pharma company but failed to do
what it was designed for… good thing these

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:31.140
folks found another use for it!
