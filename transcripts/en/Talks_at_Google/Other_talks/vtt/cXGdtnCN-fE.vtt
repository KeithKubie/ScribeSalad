&gt;&gt;Kristy: Uh, hi everyone. Thanks for coming
to today's talk, "Do It Pro Bono" with Aaron

00:00:06.310 --> 00:00:10.790
Hurst, right over here. This talk is part
of the Optimize Your Life initiative. Are

00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:15.759
folks familiar with Optimize Your Life? Yeah?
So it's again the global initiative that aims

00:00:15.759 --> 00:00:20.310
to provide Googlers with education and programs
to help them and their families to get and

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:26.610
stay healthy. So actually for folks on VC
if you could mute that would be great. Thanks.

00:00:26.610 --> 00:00:32.020
So to see all of our upcoming Health@Google
speakers and topics, check out goto/OYL and

00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:38.880
also, let me see if we can move this along.
We do have a survey where we'd love to get

00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:43.650
feedback from folks on this talk, on other
talks that you'd like to see as well, so if

00:00:43.650 --> 00:00:49.560
you can just at the end of the talk go to
go/health@survey for a 30-second survey and

00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:55.390
let us know what you think. So I'm pleased
to introduce Aaron Hurst, a globally-recognized

00:00:55.390 --> 00:01:00.350
social innovator and leading architect of
the growing pro bono services movement. Aaron's

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:05.920
career is dedicated to challenging and empowering
the private and public sectors as well as

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:10.710
individuals and organizations to drive our
collective social, environmental, and economic

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:15.640
progress. So a lot of work going on over here.
He's the founder of the Taproot Foundation,

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:19.990
which is a non-profit organization building
the national pro bono marketplace and leading

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:25.479
the global service movement. He's widely known
for his thought leadership and civic engagement,

00:01:25.479 --> 00:01:29.020
non-profit management and corporate social
responsibility, which is definitely something

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:36.100
Google's very interested in. He's also both
an Ashoka and a Draper Richards Kaplan Foundation

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:41.330
fellow. He's also been formally recognized
as a leading social innovator by the Aspen

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:46.710
Institute, the Commonwealth Club, and many
others. Aaron currently serves on the boards

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:50.920
of Reimagining Service and BoardSource. He's
also a featured blogger for the Huffington

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:55.560
Post and he's coauthor of the children's book
Mommy and Daddy Do It Pro Bono, which a lot

00:01:55.560 --> 00:02:01.259
of you guys have grabbed out here. And he
did that with his wife, Kara. And after the

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:04.630
talk today, Aaron will be graciously signing
books, so if folks are interested, you can

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:12.109
just come over to the table. And that is quite
an intro for quite a man, so please join me

00:02:12.109 --> 00:02:15.219
in welcoming Aaron.

00:02:15.219 --> 00:02:16.260
[applause]

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:22.180
&gt;&gt;Aaron Hurst: Thank you, Kristy, it's a great
to be here. I'm actually gonna go back up

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:29.489
to this one. I, which topic am I? I was looking
at these different logos. You got, OK, is

00:02:29.489 --> 00:02:38.329
the first one cooking? Cooking. Fishing. So
you like have fishing classes? Weight lifting.

00:02:38.329 --> 00:02:39.790
Religion and dancing?

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:40.950
&gt;&gt;female #1: Meditation.

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:46.439
&gt;&gt;Aaron Hurst: Meditation. Just give me the
weight lifting. Who can bench press 150 in

00:02:46.439 --> 00:02:54.950
the room? Is there? No one? Yeah? Got one.
Well, thank you all for coming today. It's

00:02:54.950 --> 00:03:01.349
a, it's an honor to be here and it's great
to see Google investing in you as whole people,

00:03:01.349 --> 00:03:05.269
not just as employees and the work you do
from 7 a.m. till midnight, but the work you

00:03:05.269 --> 00:03:08.659
do in your own life between midnight and 7
a.m. [audience chuckles] So it's just great

00:03:08.659 --> 00:03:12.481
to see that they, they care about those few
hours. So thank you. I also want to thank

00:03:12.481 --> 00:03:17.409
Google for all the support you've given the
Taproot Foundation over the years through

00:03:17.409 --> 00:03:22.239
ad words and other philanthropic programs
that you guys do. So, much appreciated and

00:03:22.239 --> 00:03:27.319
it's been great to have you as a partner in
our effort to, to make pro bono service part

00:03:27.319 --> 00:03:33.419
of what it means to be a business professional.
And I wanted to try to explain sort of quickly

00:03:33.419 --> 00:03:36.939
what Taproot is before I go through my whole
spiel, but we actually have a plant, Stanley

00:03:36.939 --> 00:03:43.519
back here. And Stanley, you want to stand
up for a second? This is Stanley.

00:03:43.519 --> 00:03:44.519
[applause]

00:03:44.519 --> 00:03:50.079
&gt;&gt;Aaron Hurst: So Stanley actually just came
up to me right beforehand and he actually

00:03:50.079 --> 00:03:56.279
worked at a non-profit called Oasis in, in
Oakland, right? And, which is a recipient

00:03:56.279 --> 00:04:02.129
of three pro bono service grants that the
Taproot Foundation did for his organization.

00:04:02.129 --> 00:04:07.170
One was around how to install a sales force
database for them to help fundraising. One

00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:11.229
was around branding and marketing for the
non-profit. And the third one was around their

00:04:11.229 --> 00:04:15.169
HR systems. And this is really what we're
all about at Taproot, is helping business

00:04:15.169 --> 00:04:20.410
professionals help non-profits with critical,
functional needs. And Stanley can tell you

00:04:20.410 --> 00:04:26.170
how horribly it all went, but that he still
loves us. So you got now like an example of

00:04:26.170 --> 00:04:29.950
someone who is now a Googler, I think as you
call them, but who came out of the non-profit

00:04:29.950 --> 00:04:36.070
sector. Hey Seth, what's up? So anyway, I
just gave you a sense for, for who we are.

00:04:36.070 --> 00:04:40.010
So I'm gonna be signing books, but I wanted
to start off by doing a little reading of

00:04:40.010 --> 00:04:45.220
a couple of the pages of this book. And I'd
actually love two volunteers. This would be

00:04:45.220 --> 00:04:52.780
like an opportunity for service right here.
We got one. Come on up. He has an organ for

00:04:52.780 --> 00:04:55.800
LA it looks like. Is that a, is that a heart?

00:04:55.800 --> 00:04:58.800
&gt;&gt;audience volunteer #1: It's a stomach.

00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:03.620
&gt;&gt;Aaron Hurst: A stomach. Like Godzilla, I
love that. Need one more. Come on up. So we're

00:05:03.620 --> 00:05:09.060
gonna do a reading and I, I think you guys
will do better justice than I will, so actually

00:05:09.060 --> 00:05:13.260
if you come on over here where the microphone
is. I'm gonna page through this and your name,

00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:14.260
sir?

00:05:14.260 --> 00:05:15.260
&gt;&gt;audience volunteer #1: Josh.

00:05:15.260 --> 00:05:17.501
&gt;&gt;Aaron Hurst: Josh, you are now seven years
old, and

00:05:17.501 --> 00:05:19.080
&gt;&gt;audience volunteer #2: Mary Ann.

00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:22.260
&gt;&gt;Aaron Hurst: Mary Ann, you're gonna be a
parental figure today. So I'm gonna go through

00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:27.280
each of these and if you can just read the
child part and if there's an adult part you

00:05:27.280 --> 00:05:33.610
can act it out or whatever you feel moved
to do. So, here's the first one. This is for

00:05:33.610 --> 00:05:34.610
engineers.

00:05:34.610 --> 00:05:35.610
&gt;&gt;female #2: Jump up to the mic.

00:05:35.610 --> 00:05:38.220
&gt;&gt;Aaron Hurst: Yeah, come on up so they can.

00:05:38.220 --> 00:05:44.190
&gt;&gt;Josh: My daddy is a computer programmer.
He makes it so you can find things on the

00:05:44.190 --> 00:05:48.720
internet. He also built a website for a group
that helps to save elephants and other animals.

00:05:48.720 --> 00:05:52.310
&gt;&gt;Aaron Hurst: He could work here. Except
for he'd probably have a better computer,

00:05:52.310 --> 00:05:57.340
but, it's a little dated. Why don't we just
rotate? We'll do the next one here, so, the

00:05:57.340 --> 00:05:58.340
next.

00:05:58.340 --> 00:05:59.340
&gt;&gt;MaryAnn: So I'll be the child again? Yeah,
ok.

00:05:59.340 --> 00:06:01.500
&gt;&gt;Aaron Hurst: Yeah, go for it, let's do that.
I forgot that it's just all--

00:06:01.500 --> 00:06:05.660
&gt;&gt;MaryAnn: My daddy makes ads for companies
to help them sell things. He says it is marketing.

00:06:05.660 --> 00:06:11.530
I saw his ad on TV for a new car. He volunteers
to help foster kids, too. This is a sign he

00:06:11.530 --> 00:06:14.560
created to help some kids find a new home.

00:06:14.560 --> 00:06:18.910
&gt;&gt;Aaron Hurst: Fantastic. A couple more here.
Sales. Show us your best sales voice.

00:06:18.910 --> 00:06:20.120
&gt;&gt;Josh: My mommy [chuckles]

00:06:20.120 --> 00:06:21.120
[laughter]

00:06:21.120 --> 00:06:22.120
&gt;&gt;MaryAnn: As a child.

00:06:22.120 --> 00:06:23.850
&gt;&gt;Aaron Hurst: A little bit deeper like you
really mean it.

00:06:23.850 --> 00:06:25.180
&gt;&gt;Josh: But as a child.

00:06:25.180 --> 00:06:26.570
&gt;&gt;Aaron Hurst: Yes, of course.

00:06:26.570 --> 00:06:31.090
&gt;&gt;Josh: My mommy is a consultant. She flies
around the world to help companies solve difficult

00:06:31.090 --> 00:06:36.460
problems. She took me to this play. She helped
them get more people to come to the theater.

00:06:36.460 --> 00:06:40.630
&gt;&gt;Aaron Hurst: What a mom. I think this is
the last one.

00:06:40.630 --> 00:06:41.630
&gt;&gt;MaryAnn: Ok.

00:06:41.630 --> 00:06:42.680
&gt;&gt;Aaron Hurst: Close this with dramatic flair.

00:06:42.680 --> 00:06:48.940
&gt;&gt;MaryAnn: Ok. My daddy is an HR manager.
He helps to hire people for jobs at his work.

00:06:48.940 --> 00:06:53.610
He uses his skills pro bono to help injured
soldiers get new jobs when they come back

00:06:53.610 --> 00:06:54.760
from war.

00:06:54.760 --> 00:06:58.210
&gt;&gt;Aaron Hurst: Thank you, that was.

00:06:58.210 --> 00:06:59.210
[applause]

00:06:59.210 --> 00:07:02.990
&gt;&gt;Aaron Hurst: Does anybody have any acting
tips for them? Just anything you'd like to

00:07:02.990 --> 00:07:06.710
see improved for the next one? I know you
guys are into professional development, so

00:07:06.710 --> 00:07:13.030
I wanna make sure. Pretty good? Ok. Thank
you both. I appreciate, appreciate the reading.

00:07:13.030 --> 00:07:18.320
So my wife and I created this book a couple
years ago because we both had little kids.

00:07:18.320 --> 00:07:23.740
We'd just had a. We both. Of course we did.
We had little kids and we realized in reading

00:07:23.740 --> 00:07:28.450
children's books that there were two things
that were missing. One was that every children's

00:07:28.450 --> 00:07:33.830
book was about astronauts, ballerinas, policemen
and firemen. There were no kids' books that

00:07:33.830 --> 00:07:38.060
were about the jobs of a lot of the people
that we knew. And a lot of those people, like

00:07:38.060 --> 00:07:42.400
if you're an HR manager and a kid asks you,
what, you know what the hell is an HR manager?

00:07:42.400 --> 00:07:47.280
Which is how my kid probably would phrase
it. There, there was no way of describing

00:07:47.280 --> 00:07:51.490
it or talking about it. And it really was
a disservice, 'cause therefore like every

00:07:51.490 --> 00:07:55.740
kid just wants to be a fireman, and none of
them were inspired to be great HR managers,

00:07:55.740 --> 00:08:01.210
so we saw a need for that. The second piece
was that there weren't books about celebrating

00:08:01.210 --> 00:08:05.730
not just what people do in their office setting,
but what they do to use their skills to make

00:08:05.730 --> 00:08:11.340
a difference and about setting that precedent
in the eyes of a child. And realizing that

00:08:11.340 --> 00:08:15.910
marketing is not just about selling cars,
but it's also about using marketing to help

00:08:15.910 --> 00:08:20.340
that foster kid, as we talked about. So we
realized there was an opportunity here for

00:08:20.340 --> 00:08:26.240
a book that pretended like it was for kids,
but really was for adults to help them have

00:08:26.240 --> 00:08:31.880
that conversation with kids. But also our
hope was to inspire parents to think of two

00:08:31.880 --> 00:08:36.699
things. One, what would your child? How many
of you actually have kids in the room? I know

00:08:36.699 --> 00:08:43.830
at least one. Fantastic. Breeding. I love
it. Breeding smart people. I love it. That's

00:08:43.830 --> 00:08:48.809
good. The, there's actually a guy, who's,
he's actually up in Menlo Park, it was a lawyer

00:08:48.809 --> 00:08:51.790
originally actually that inspired this. He
said, I asked him why do you do pro bono work?

00:08:51.790 --> 00:08:56.410
Why do you on top of working 70 hours a week,
or whatever it was, why do you go out and

00:08:56.410 --> 00:09:00.800
do pro bono work? And he said it was because
his kid, who was like seven, asked him what

00:09:00.800 --> 00:09:05.070
he did for a living and he said he didn't
like the answer. He said I wanted to figure

00:09:05.070 --> 00:09:10.350
out how, how my kid looks at what I do for
a living and making sure they felt great about

00:09:10.350 --> 00:09:16.439
what I do. But the secondary piece is he reflected
on himself at seven, and the dreams he had

00:09:16.439 --> 00:09:20.120
when he was seven and what he wanted to be
and then looked at what he was actually doing,

00:09:20.120 --> 00:09:23.920
and saw a mid-life crisis coming, right? When
he was suddenly gonna realize he'd gone off

00:09:23.920 --> 00:09:28.870
on this track and hadn't fully invested in
his values in who he is. And what's wonderful

00:09:28.870 --> 00:09:32.970
about pro bono, it's not about quitting your
job to go become a nun. It's about doing the

00:09:32.970 --> 00:09:37.130
great work you do in a commercial setting
at your job, but realizing you're developing

00:09:37.130 --> 00:09:42.019
skills and giving those back in a much broader
setting to drive social impact and having

00:09:42.019 --> 00:09:46.430
those things blended into your life. And that's
really what this book was all about. So I'm

00:09:46.430 --> 00:09:51.529
excited to be signing copies afterwards. And
hopefully it'll lead to discussions with your

00:09:51.529 --> 00:09:59.600
own kids about what you do. It has other professions
in there, these are some, some highlights.

00:09:59.600 --> 00:10:03.699
So that does the closing thing on the book.
What do your mommy and daddy do? So it just

00:10:03.699 --> 00:10:07.139
encourages you to think about, you know, your
life, to think about that question and how

00:10:07.139 --> 00:10:11.389
you want to answer that question. And it's
a really profou-, it's the most simple, but

00:10:11.389 --> 00:10:15.740
most profound question, 'cause it is again
both the voice of your child and your inner

00:10:15.740 --> 00:10:21.610
seven year old that's in you thinking about
and judging your life. Which is probably the

00:10:21.610 --> 00:10:29.350
most judgmental voice you can possibly have.
So the big message I wanna leave you with

00:10:29.350 --> 00:10:33.220
today, I'm gonna go through a number of slides
here, but. Does anybody know who these two

00:10:33.220 --> 00:10:35.699
folks are? Yes.

00:10:35.699 --> 00:10:39.350
&gt;&gt;female #4: The peanut gallery from the Muppet
Show.

00:10:39.350 --> 00:10:42.449
&gt;&gt;Aaron Hurst: The peanut gallery from the
Muppet Show. That is exactly right. They are,

00:10:42.449 --> 00:10:48.430
they represent the old, the old white guys,
so we sort of always think about as sort of

00:10:48.430 --> 00:10:54.249
like traditionally involved in leadership,
traditionally involved in philanthropy, etc.

00:10:54.249 --> 00:11:00.680
And they had, these guys specifically, but
most people, this idea that you should learn,

00:11:00.680 --> 00:11:06.899
earn, then return. How many people have heard
that expression? Learn, earn. Seth has. Joel.

00:11:06.899 --> 00:11:11.730
That's it? This is, I'm gonna dispel a myth
you did not even know was a myth. I mean how

00:11:11.730 --> 00:11:17.819
often do you get to do that? This is fantastic.
So as I, conventional thinking in American

00:11:17.819 --> 00:11:23.190
business that you should first learn. You
go to school, you get in debt, you learn a

00:11:23.190 --> 00:11:27.990
lot of stuff. Right? Then you stop learning
and you start earning. And you should just

00:11:27.990 --> 00:11:31.910
dedicate every waking hour to making money,
making money. And some day you're gonna be

00:11:31.910 --> 00:11:37.470
fabulously wealthy and then you start to return
it back to society. Right? That's sort of

00:11:37.470 --> 00:11:41.420
this gen, there's a general philosophy. And
if you go to Wall Street, even you know I

00:11:41.420 --> 00:11:44.839
think here in Silicon Valley there's a lot
of that attitude of, I don't need to worry

00:11:44.839 --> 00:11:49.540
about giving back now because later on I'm
gonna have so much money, I'll be able to

00:11:49.540 --> 00:11:53.220
give then, and that's what my goal is, to
like accumulate wealth so that some day I

00:11:53.220 --> 00:11:57.529
do that stuff. Well, let's just wait until
then. Now I'm just, I gotta make money. So

00:11:57.529 --> 00:12:01.790
there's like 100 flaws with this logic. Right?
The first most obvious one is that if you

00:12:01.790 --> 00:12:07.929
get hit by a bus at 24, you never got to like
experience the wonder of giving back, right?

00:12:07.929 --> 00:12:11.459
Because you always assumed there'd be the
next day. But not everyone's gonna be able

00:12:11.459 --> 00:12:16.649
to like, to make it there and also you may
not be able due to life circumstances, be

00:12:16.649 --> 00:12:20.029
able to return, you're not gonna be the next
billionaire. You're not gonna have the resources

00:12:20.029 --> 00:12:24.180
you think you're gonna have. So it's also
based a lot on this false premise and optimism

00:12:24.180 --> 00:12:28.490
of like I'll always have more later. Things
are hard now, but I'll always have more later.

00:12:28.490 --> 00:12:33.379
Which is also a fallacy. It's also a fallacy
'cause it's based on the assumption that you

00:12:33.379 --> 00:12:38.309
should stop learning when you graduate from
college or business school. That that's sort

00:12:38.309 --> 00:12:41.379
of your learning opportunity and then you're
just like gonna go to work. Which I think

00:12:41.379 --> 00:12:47.129
also in the contemporary business world, you
have to learn every day. You have to learn

00:12:47.129 --> 00:12:50.519
how to be better at what you do. You have
to learn more about yourself. So I really

00:12:50.519 --> 00:12:55.579
see and what I profess is the idea that you
should be learning, earning and returning

00:12:55.579 --> 00:13:00.809
every day of your career. That every day you
should be looking at what can I learn today?

00:13:00.809 --> 00:13:06.089
What can I give back? And be able to obviously
pay the bills so you can send your kids to

00:13:06.089 --> 00:13:09.339
school and make sure they've got food on the
table. But that we need to integrate these

00:13:09.339 --> 00:13:14.519
things much more into our lives and as part
of our identity. Does that make sense? Alright.

00:13:14.519 --> 00:13:21.760
Anybody, is anyone in the room an economics
major? Sweet. We've got two. So you have to

00:13:21.760 --> 00:13:27.350
help me with this one. Oh, this is a visual
for it, before we get to it. This is a basic

00:13:27.350 --> 00:13:33.759
idea of present value of service. So, be honest,
the idea of present value, does that ring

00:13:33.759 --> 00:13:38.630
a bell? Yes. What is, what is like at a high
level of present, what is, what does it mean?

00:13:38.630 --> 00:13:41.329
Share with your fellow Googlers.

00:13:41.329 --> 00:13:46.459
&gt;&gt;female #4: [inaudible]

00:13:46.459 --> 00:13:55.449
&gt;&gt;Aaron Hurst: So, to repeat that, basically
you take something in the future of value

00:13:55.449 --> 00:13:59.459
and you discount it to what it would be worth
today. So for example, the way I think about

00:13:59.459 --> 00:14:06.220
it is, if you invest $100 in the stock market
today versus $100 ten years from now, you

00:14:06.220 --> 00:14:10.369
will have accumulated all that hopefully additional
return over those ten years, so that $100

00:14:10.369 --> 00:14:17.519
is worth more now than doing it then, right?
So the basic premise here is, and this goes

00:14:17.519 --> 00:14:25.069
to the learn, earn, return piece, your serving
right now has a much bigger impact than if

00:14:25.069 --> 00:14:29.100
you do it ten years from now. If you wait
till you retire, you will have much less of

00:14:29.100 --> 00:14:33.959
an impact, not just because of the volume
of what you do, but the compounded social

00:14:33.959 --> 00:14:38.230
interest, if you will, of that service. So
this image I think illustrates it well, which

00:14:38.230 --> 00:14:43.249
is, this is a picture of New York City in
about 20 years when the streets are fully

00:14:43.249 --> 00:14:47.819
flooded from global warming, right? So it
shows like what it's gonna look like once

00:14:47.819 --> 00:14:53.320
the sea level rises and all the streets become
flooded. So, if you think about it, if you,

00:14:53.320 --> 00:15:00.319
right now work with an environmental organization
to help combat climate change and fight to

00:15:00.319 --> 00:15:05.290
save the ozone and our natural environment,
we might actually prevent that water from

00:15:05.290 --> 00:15:10.399
seeping up onto my, the streets of the city
I live in. Or, 10 years from now or 20 years

00:15:10.399 --> 00:15:16.459
from now we'll probably need you to volunteer
to be like a gondolier for people going to

00:15:16.459 --> 00:15:20.160
the hospital, 'cause they'll need like a gondolier
service to get to the hospital, right? So

00:15:20.160 --> 00:15:25.660
the impact of your service today is infinitely
more valuable than it will be in 10 years.

00:15:25.660 --> 00:15:31.290
Another example of that, and these are hyperbole
obviously, you take a kid, like a disadvantaged

00:15:31.290 --> 00:15:36.460
kid is in a tough spot, has a lot of things
going against him at say age four. You could

00:15:36.460 --> 00:15:40.129
be a mentor for them today and like try to
help get them on the right track and help

00:15:40.129 --> 00:15:44.350
support them, or if you wait 20 years, you're
likely gonna be doing what I did, which was

00:15:44.350 --> 00:15:48.810
teaching creative writing to inmates in a
prison, to that same kid because at that point

00:15:48.810 --> 00:15:52.819
they'll have gone down a path or may have
gone down a path where the options for how

00:15:52.819 --> 00:15:57.560
you can serve them are so greatly diminished.
So again this is why the idea of waiting till

00:15:57.560 --> 00:16:02.589
your later in your career to make that difference
fundamentally, like, is gonna mean that you

00:16:02.589 --> 00:16:09.920
have less of an impact than if you start today.
This is my highly-technical economics graph

00:16:09.920 --> 00:16:16.889
to show that. Which basically shows, I gotta
redo it, it's terrible. The bottom orange

00:16:16.889 --> 00:16:20.560
line represents sort of the trajectory of
an issue, right, so it could be global warming,

00:16:20.560 --> 00:16:26.369
it could be some kid's life. And basically,
if you start your intervention early in that

00:16:26.369 --> 00:16:30.350
timeline and you have that trajectory, you
actually end up making a much bigger difference

00:16:30.350 --> 00:16:35.730
versus if you start with that same intervention
or a similar one later on in that life cycle,

00:16:35.730 --> 00:16:38.839
like you don't end up making as big an impact.
And it's not just due to the effort, it has

00:16:38.839 --> 00:16:43.459
to do with the trajectory of that, that return.
And this is really important I think to just

00:16:43.459 --> 00:16:48.309
understand the present value of service, not
to wait another month, not to wait another

00:16:48.309 --> 00:16:51.869
year, not to wait till you retire, but knowing
that a small thing now will have a bigger

00:16:51.869 --> 00:17:00.510
impact than a big thing later. Any questions
about the uh, this graph? The continuum with

00:17:00.510 --> 00:17:06.800
the cosign of it is?
So I wanted to talk a little bit about, this

00:17:06.800 --> 00:17:11.440
is a specific issue, education, which is something
that I care a lot about 'cause I have kids.

00:17:11.440 --> 00:17:17.090
But just to give you a sense of like the diversity
of skills that non-profits, whether it's you

00:17:17.090 --> 00:17:20.360
know a school, whether it's a non-profit,
whether it's a government agency, what they

00:17:20.360 --> 00:17:26.440
need from people like yourselves. This is
just a representative sample, but you take

00:17:26.440 --> 00:17:31.500
like marketing, right? Non-profits are in
desperate need for marketing because they

00:17:31.500 --> 00:17:35.460
do incredibly great work and Stanley can back
this up, they do great work, but you wouldn't

00:17:35.460 --> 00:17:39.380
often know from reading their materials they
do great work. Like there's such a huge delta

00:17:39.380 --> 00:17:43.211
between the reality of their work and the
materials and the way they describe what they

00:17:43.211 --> 00:17:48.320
do. And it's partially a resources issue,
but it's also, I used to work in the technology,

00:17:48.320 --> 00:17:53.170
and it's also the engineering problem. Engineers
aren't good at marketing their own wares,

00:17:53.170 --> 00:17:55.700
because they think every little detail matters
and they have trouble figuring out what the

00:17:55.700 --> 00:17:59.900
thing is that like is the real selling point,
right? Similarly, if you're a non-profit program

00:17:59.900 --> 00:18:03.710
manager who's doing work with people, you
think every little thing you do for them is

00:18:03.710 --> 00:18:08.400
like so important that you couldn't possibly
leave that piece out, and therefore you become

00:18:08.400 --> 00:18:12.620
a terrible spokesperson because you don't
know what the real core story is, right? So

00:18:12.620 --> 00:18:16.430
having marketers come into an organization,
help tell the stories, figure out what the

00:18:16.430 --> 00:18:21.850
core messaging is, to tell that amazing story,
is incredibly powerful.

00:18:21.850 --> 00:18:29.250
Management. So few non-profit executives have
training in management. Very few for-profit

00:18:29.250 --> 00:18:33.610
ones for that matter as well, but it's even
worse in the, the non-profit sector. And you

00:18:33.610 --> 00:18:36.560
know, and strategy, and being able to put
together a real strategy, being able to really

00:18:36.560 --> 00:18:41.070
do the research behind the strategy, to be
able to do the people management of an organization

00:18:41.070 --> 00:18:45.000
it could so resource constraints. So being
able to help bring that kind of thinking and

00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:49.830
mentorship. And mentorship is one of the best
ways to do that.

00:18:49.830 --> 00:18:53.800
Information technology. I mean we talked about
sales force, that's a great example where

00:18:53.800 --> 00:18:58.730
so many non-profits you go into are still
using Excel spreadsheets to manage all their

00:18:58.730 --> 00:19:02.540
donors. Which works when you have like 10
of them, but it gets to a point like at around

00:19:02.540 --> 00:19:08.170
13½ where it just becomes impossible to manage.
So they need people to help with technology.

00:19:08.170 --> 00:19:12.020
It's much better than it was 10 years ago,
but there's still so much need at a basic

00:19:12.020 --> 00:19:16.490
level and then at a transformational level
there's even more opportunities around rethinking

00:19:16.490 --> 00:19:20.370
your programs and how do you actually, like,
run your organization in a different way by

00:19:20.370 --> 00:19:25.860
leveraging technology?
Design. This goes to that same point about

00:19:25.860 --> 00:19:32.630
marketing. If you look at the logo or the
actual visuals of a typical non-profit, it

00:19:32.630 --> 00:19:35.370
often looks like it was done by a high school
student and yet the work they're doing is

00:19:35.370 --> 00:19:40.521
like a post-doctorate, like, incredible sophistication.
And it's such a crime, because I think it

00:19:40.521 --> 00:19:46.280
not only serves them poorly, but it actually
erodes confidence overall in non-profits,

00:19:46.280 --> 00:19:50.460
'cause we tend to think that that represents
the quality of the work they do, and it doesn't.

00:19:50.460 --> 00:19:54.780
It actually hurts our society at a much broader
level, not having that kind of design resource

00:19:54.780 --> 00:20:00.670
for non-profits.
And then finally HR. This is one that's like

00:20:00.670 --> 00:20:04.761
a personal passion for me just because non-profits
are fundamentally in a people business, but

00:20:04.761 --> 00:20:09.730
so few of them have the systems to support
their people effectively. We did a focus group

00:20:09.730 --> 00:20:16.280
a couple years ago with about ten non-profit
executive directors, so the CEOs. And we just

00:20:16.280 --> 00:20:21.940
asked, how many of you have ever worked in
an organization that have like a, like a functioning

00:20:21.940 --> 00:20:27.180
HR department? Not one of them raised their
hand. There's just a fundamental issue of

00:20:27.180 --> 00:20:32.910
not having, even seeing what it looks like
to even know what the systems are. And I'm

00:20:32.910 --> 00:20:37.920
the first one to criticize a lot of HR practices
that are overwrought, cause all kinds of issues.

00:20:37.920 --> 00:20:41.160
But there's some really core pieces just around
doing performance reviews and setting that

00:20:41.160 --> 00:20:44.670
up and helping set goals for people. Making
sure you're optimizing what their benefits

00:20:44.670 --> 00:20:49.500
can be. Like sort of training about how to
be a manager. There are some really core things

00:20:49.500 --> 00:20:54.050
that organizations don't even actually know
how to access those resources and being able

00:20:54.050 --> 00:20:58.700
to bring an HR professional to do an audit
of their overall HR practices and suggest

00:20:58.700 --> 00:21:03.230
some of the key ways they could move forward
is transformational for them.

00:21:03.230 --> 00:21:12.250
So any, has anyone done any of this kind of
work for non-profits? Seth has. A little bit?

00:21:12.250 --> 00:21:18.700
What a great opportunity for you guys to get
out later this afternoon and do some of it.

00:21:18.700 --> 00:21:23.790
But this is so critical. This stuff is so
needed and unlike doing traditional volunteerism,

00:21:23.790 --> 00:21:32.960
it has a much greater impact, which goes to
my two friends here. Jill and Jim. So this

00:21:32.960 --> 00:21:37.560
is based on data that's out there now, just
talking about if you're gonna do service,

00:21:37.560 --> 00:21:44.070
why doing service, using your skills is so
valuable. And Jill, she works at Google. She's

00:21:44.070 --> 00:21:51.730
smart. She does pro bono service. Jim over
here works somewhere else, not quite as swift.

00:21:51.730 --> 00:21:58.000
And he does volunteering by painting things,
right? So the data shows that Jill provides

00:21:58.000 --> 00:22:04.500
six times more value than Jim. So when she's
using her skills to do work in the community,

00:22:04.500 --> 00:22:10.570
she is providing literally six times more
value for society than Jim. She is three times

00:22:10.570 --> 00:22:15.470
more likely to gain material job-related skills,
so actually learn things about how to be better

00:22:15.470 --> 00:22:24.821
at her job, and she's five times more likely
to make an impact overall, where is it? Social

00:22:24.821 --> 00:22:29.450
impact as Jim's company like overall as part
of the broader program. On the flip side,

00:22:29.450 --> 00:22:34.030
Jim over here, he's 25 percent less likely
to develop new internal relationships. You

00:22:34.030 --> 00:22:38.210
actually build more relationships internally
in your company by working with your peers

00:22:38.210 --> 00:22:43.810
on skilled projects than if you do it for
non-skilled work. Jim is less likely to be

00:22:43.810 --> 00:22:48.480
satisfied with his experience. This is surprising
because people often say, yeah, I should do

00:22:48.480 --> 00:22:51.970
skilled, but like, I want to get out there
and just, you know, enjoy the sun. I want

00:22:51.970 --> 00:22:55.270
to something different, it'll be a lot more
fun. But people actually report having, being

00:22:55.270 --> 00:22:58.220
much more satisfied when they're using their
skills, 'cause they know they're making a

00:22:58.220 --> 00:23:03.290
bigger impact, they're more engaged and they
still get the psychic rewards. And most importantly,

00:23:03.290 --> 00:23:07.430
Jim is 100 percent more likely to get paint
on his suit. Which probably is not as much

00:23:07.430 --> 00:23:11.500
of an issue here, 'cause I don't think anyone's
wearing a suit. But you have some nice t-shirts

00:23:11.500 --> 00:23:17.280
and sweatshirts and stuff, so it applies the
same way. So this again, as you think about

00:23:17.280 --> 00:23:22.530
both for Google as a company but each of you
individually, leveraging your skills is just,

00:23:22.530 --> 00:23:27.560
from a business standpoint, from a personal
standpoint just a much better value proposition

00:23:27.560 --> 00:23:33.000
for you in terms of going out there and doing
stuff. Any questions about that? Does anyone

00:23:33.000 --> 00:23:41.230
debate like the 100% paint on the suit stat
or anything? Not one. Ok.

00:23:41.230 --> 00:23:46.100
So I wanna give you a quick sense of where
the state of pro bono is. So as Kristy generously

00:23:46.100 --> 00:23:50.040
shared, I've been leading this movement around
pro bono service and I wanted to give you

00:23:50.040 --> 00:23:54.350
a sense of where we've come and where this
is now and Seth knows some of this stuff.

00:23:54.350 --> 00:24:01.950
Hopefully, can you guys in the back read this
ok? Probably not, but you can pretend. Be

00:24:01.950 --> 00:24:06.060
generous. I just want to share a couple of
these statistics that I think are really interesting,

00:24:06.060 --> 00:24:11.010
just to catch your imagination. On the left
here you see the number of projects delivered

00:24:11.010 --> 00:24:18.440
by CreateAthon's 73 agencies. It's 2500. So
CreateAthon is a program where ad agencies

00:24:18.440 --> 00:24:22.750
basically shut down for 24 hours. So basically
from 9 a.m. till 9 a.m. the next day, like

00:24:22.750 --> 00:24:26.810
literally around the clock. And they bust
out websites, logos, brochures, annual reports

00:24:26.810 --> 00:24:32.770
for non-profits. And they have 73 different
ad agencies that have signed up for this and

00:24:32.770 --> 00:24:38.030
have delivered over 2500 projects for non-profits.
And it's amazing, like the people on this

00:24:38.030 --> 00:24:41.130
just love it, 'cause it's like such a great
team-building activity to all get together.

00:24:41.130 --> 00:24:44.511
So one thing you can think about is like getting
a group of your colleagues together and just

00:24:44.511 --> 00:24:49.740
thinking about like what could you do in a
24-hour sort of sprint helping non-profits

00:24:49.740 --> 00:24:54.290
around something. There's another technology
one called the Nerdery, which I think is a

00:24:54.290 --> 00:24:59.050
fabulous name, out of Minneapolis, that does
this around technology, and they just do 24-hour

00:24:59.050 --> 00:25:05.760
sort of just builds. I'm gonna go over here
to the five percent in this bubble. AIGA,

00:25:05.760 --> 00:25:09.980
which is the American Institute for Graphic
Arts, so it's the trade association of graphic

00:25:09.980 --> 00:25:14.150
artists, they've set a goal now that all graphic
designers and graphic design firms should

00:25:14.150 --> 00:25:19.400
give five percent of their billable time to
pro bono service. So you're seeing this starting

00:25:19.400 --> 00:25:24.450
to actually get adopted by the professions
who are at large, like in a really fundamental

00:25:24.450 --> 00:25:30.270
way. I mean five percent is a lot of, a lot
of time, especially for a services business.

00:25:30.270 --> 00:25:35.630
Twenty. The number of top 25 business schools
that have pro bono programs. So were getting

00:25:35.630 --> 00:25:40.940
to the point now where just about every business
school is making pro bono part of the experience

00:25:40.940 --> 00:25:45.470
of getting an MBA. And we're gonna start having
more and more students graduating who expect

00:25:45.470 --> 00:25:52.570
to be able to do pro bono in their work. It's
incredibly exciting. Capital One is a company

00:25:52.570 --> 00:25:57.370
that's done an incredibly great job at this.
Capital One started this a couple of years

00:25:57.370 --> 00:26:03.050
ago in '08 and they've served 125 non-profits
through their company. It's not a consulting

00:26:03.050 --> 00:26:07.660
firm, it's a bank, a credit card company and
a bank. But they actually set it up so each

00:26:07.660 --> 00:26:12.490
of their departments, like technology, legal,
real estate, etc. each took on a couple projects

00:26:12.490 --> 00:26:17.130
a year for local non-profits. And it was a
really, it's a really fabulous model and it's

00:26:17.130 --> 00:26:21.390
coordinated across the whole company, but
it enabled them to make a real difference

00:26:21.390 --> 00:26:25.320
in the different fields and it has the heads
of each of those departments really taking

00:26:25.320 --> 00:26:35.080
ownership in a really powerful way. I want
to share the two, I think, most challenging

00:26:35.080 --> 00:26:40.340
stats. The first is the bottom here it says
three percent. That's the percentage of non-profits

00:26:40.340 --> 00:26:45.400
that report having access to the pro bono
services they need. So only three percent

00:26:45.400 --> 00:26:51.570
of non-profits in this country feel they have
the resources they need on a pro bono basis

00:26:51.570 --> 00:26:57.000
to help them achieve their missions, right?
Like that's a pretty depressing thought, right?

00:26:57.000 --> 00:27:04.210
Or huge opportunity. On the opposite side
here are the word access. The number one barrier

00:27:04.210 --> 00:27:09.520
of non-profits to getting more pro bono is
access. If you're a non-profit executive director,

00:27:09.520 --> 00:27:13.990
you don't know which companies offer what,
you don't know who to ask, you don't know

00:27:13.990 --> 00:27:18.600
how to scope and state what your need is.
So there's a huge need, not just for pro bono,

00:27:18.600 --> 00:27:22.360
but for helping non-profits really gain access.
So one of the things you could do individually

00:27:22.360 --> 00:27:26.990
is just mentor a non-profit to help them think
about what are all their needs and think about

00:27:26.990 --> 00:27:31.031
in your network, whether it's a virtual network
or your, through people you work with, how

00:27:31.031 --> 00:27:35.430
to help them source and get those people to
meet that need. So that simple act of being

00:27:35.430 --> 00:27:41.320
a matchmaker and helping them gain access,
solves for a huge part of this three percent

00:27:41.320 --> 00:27:45.310
problem. 'Cause in our experience people want
to do pro bono, they just don't, no one ever

00:27:45.310 --> 00:27:49.890
asks them, so they don't know where to go.
So helping to be that matchmaker is incredibly,

00:27:49.890 --> 00:27:57.590
incredibly powerful. Taproot Foundation at
this point, you see here in the bottom middle,

00:27:57.590 --> 00:28:02.180
we've done over a million hours of pro bono
service using pro bono consultants from across

00:28:02.180 --> 00:28:06.940
the country for non-profits. It's been incredibly
rewarding just to work with these thousands

00:28:06.940 --> 00:28:11.500
of business professionals that each give 100
hours of their time to help a local non-profit

00:28:11.500 --> 00:28:16.470
in the arts, education, the environment, etc.
And that's really where we learned about how

00:28:16.470 --> 00:28:22.070
to make this all work. We also now, and Stanley
and I were just talking about this, we now

00:28:22.070 --> 00:28:26.900
work with over 25 companies where they hire
us to help them build their own pro bono programs,

00:28:26.900 --> 00:28:30.570
'cause we realize no matter how big we are,
we'll never be big enough, so we are working

00:28:30.570 --> 00:28:35.190
with companies to help them build their own
programs, so that they can help the sector.

00:28:35.190 --> 00:28:38.850
'Cause this three percent, I mean if Taproot
was wildly successful, we might get to that

00:28:38.850 --> 00:28:44.480
to like four percent, five percent. Like we'll
never be big enough. But if companies adopt

00:28:44.480 --> 00:28:48.660
this, we can really make a difference there,
so we see a lot of growth there. Any questions

00:28:48.660 --> 00:28:57.120
on any of? So my challenge to you, and then
I'm gonna open up for questions, I find that

00:28:57.120 --> 00:29:03.130
much more engaging by definition. I know you
guys recently launched Google+, which is fantastic,

00:29:03.130 --> 00:29:07.120
even though no one's invited me to be a member
of it, goddammit.

00:29:07.120 --> 00:29:08.120
[laughter]

00:29:08.120 --> 00:29:14.830
&gt;&gt;Aaron Hurst: Clearly labeled as a late adopter,
I guess. Or very unnetworked. But I want to

00:29:14.830 --> 00:29:17.590
challenge you to think a little bit differently
about the definition of this and think about

00:29:17.590 --> 00:29:21.960
it more in terms of yourself and think about
what you do at Google, but what you should

00:29:21.960 --> 00:29:26.190
do plus, sort of as a plus on top of that,
right? So you have what you do every day again

00:29:26.190 --> 00:29:30.861
from 7 a.m. till midnight, but to think about
you know what you do with that plus. What

00:29:30.861 --> 00:29:36.500
is the plus that you wanna have in your life
to really make yourself that parent who has

00:29:36.500 --> 00:29:40.670
a great answer for their kids, but also to
be able to satisfy the seven year old inside

00:29:40.670 --> 00:29:45.970
you that's asking, you know, are you on the
path, are you doing and being the change that

00:29:45.970 --> 00:29:50.560
you wanna see? Are you proud of who you are
as a total person and are you really learning,

00:29:50.560 --> 00:29:56.001
earning and returning every day, and if not,
how do you get that plus to be part of your

00:29:56.001 --> 00:30:02.840
experience as a Googler? So. With that I would
love to open it up to any questions people

00:30:02.840 --> 00:30:06.570
may have, if any, I don't know. Don't want
to force questions.

00:30:06.570 --> 00:30:15.040
&gt;&gt;male #1: What's your e-mail address for
a plus invitation?

00:30:15.040 --> 00:30:21.170
&gt;&gt;Aaron Hurst: It's Aaron, aaron@taprootfoundation.org.
Sweet. I'm gonna be busy the rest of the afternoon

00:30:21.170 --> 00:30:26.930
figuring out what to do with that, so, thank
you. Yeah, please.

00:30:26.930 --> 00:30:32.380
[audience laughs]
&gt;&gt;female audience member #5: What is the,

00:30:32.380 --> 00:30:36.620
what is the access point for [inaudible]

00:30:36.620 --> 00:30:42.961
&gt;&gt;Aaron Hurst: Yeah, another great question.
So I think there's a, Taproot definitely is

00:30:42.961 --> 00:30:48.450
always looking for marketing, HR, strategy,
finance professionals in the bay area, D.C.,

00:30:48.450 --> 00:30:53.090
New York, Chicago and LA. So you know we'd
love to have you come join us and be part

00:30:53.090 --> 00:30:57.020
of that. I think alternatively, you know,
think about who you know that are on non-profit

00:30:57.020 --> 00:31:00.550
boards and ask them, like are there needs
that they have or is there any way you could

00:31:00.550 --> 00:31:03.380
help, is there a way you could do it on a
personal level? Seth is there anything like

00:31:03.380 --> 00:31:06.930
at Google you could point them to or I should
be?

00:31:06.930 --> 00:31:17.100
&gt;&gt;Seth: I think we're, we're building up [inaudible]

00:31:17.100 --> 00:31:26.630
&gt;&gt;Aaron Hurst: So, and I was reminded that
the microphone, I need to make sure for the

00:31:26.630 --> 00:31:30.810
people not here that to repeat that, so. The
original question was how to get involved

00:31:30.810 --> 00:31:34.890
and I'd asked Seth sort of what are the opportunities
through Google? And Seth's really working

00:31:34.890 --> 00:31:38.170
to try to get more of a formal pro bono program
up at Google, so the best thing you can do

00:31:38.170 --> 00:31:43.870
to support him is harass him and all of his
chain of command, do it faster, so that we

00:31:43.870 --> 00:31:47.581
can get that going here. But, you know, I
think Seth, also in the short term, probably

00:31:47.581 --> 00:31:51.860
gets conversations with random non-profits
that are like, gosh I wish I had a X, Y or

00:31:51.860 --> 00:31:55.700
a Z, so you know, I think also just letting
him know that you're interested will, it'll

00:31:55.700 --> 00:31:56.700
help.

00:31:56.700 --> 00:31:58.460
&gt;&gt;Kristy: Yeah. One quick, quick plug on that.

00:31:58.460 --> 00:32:00.000
&gt;&gt;Aaron Hurst: Yeah. Plug away.

00:32:00.000 --> 00:32:03.680
&gt;&gt;Kristy: So there's actually a program that's
been developed right now for sales and we're

00:32:03.680 --> 00:32:06.950
gonna be rolling it out to the rest of the
company. It's this one percent time. Have

00:32:06.950 --> 00:32:12.250
folks heard of this? Yeah. So, right now it
is focused on skills-based projects and there's

00:32:12.250 --> 00:32:21.010
over 300 projects, so if folks are interested,
go to goto/onepercenttime or goto/salesonepercent

00:32:21.010 --> 00:32:23.190
and there's a lot of stuff there, so definitely
take a look.

00:32:23.190 --> 00:32:28.559
&gt;&gt;Aaron Hurst: Cool. Great plug. And sales
is a key area that non-profits need help with.

00:32:28.559 --> 00:32:33.470
I think it's less on, it's sales skills and
it's also sales operations of like running,

00:32:33.470 --> 00:32:37.450
like how do you do pipeline management, how
do you like manage overall to like forecast

00:32:37.450 --> 00:32:41.820
your revenue, etc. These are really critical
skills that a lot of non-profits can really

00:32:41.820 --> 00:32:46.110
benefit from. There was a question, yes, in
the middle there.

00:32:46.110 --> 00:32:56.970
&gt;&gt;female #6: So, I [inaudible] that's really
great, but I need that fence painted. What's

00:32:56.970 --> 00:33:06.750
your response to that? [inaudible]

00:33:06.750 --> 00:33:14.490
&gt;&gt;Aaron Hurst: So that gives a, so the question
is this Googler often goes to the schools

00:33:14.490 --> 00:33:18.680
and churches and does volunteering, doing
more manual labor, and asks, you know says

00:33:18.680 --> 00:33:25.161
that she is a, in technology and couldn't
they be leveraging her skills and they generally

00:33:25.161 --> 00:33:28.910
say you know what? That fence really does
need painting, why don't you just, you know,

00:33:28.910 --> 00:33:32.820
code that fence with some paint? You know,
I think it's an interesting, I think there's

00:33:32.820 --> 00:33:36.460
a couple different pieces to that. I think
one is a question of who you're talking to

00:33:36.460 --> 00:33:40.860
often and finding the right person who actually
knows where that paint point is. I think a

00:33:40.860 --> 00:33:44.400
lot of times people don't know how to, they
don't know how to use you, so being able to

00:33:44.400 --> 00:33:47.730
say, would it be helpful for me to come in
and do like a diagnostic upfront of just how

00:33:47.730 --> 00:33:51.810
you're using technology overall and see coming
out of that how to help? 'Cause often they

00:33:51.810 --> 00:33:55.820
just don't even have that upfront work done.
And it's not hard for these organizations

00:33:55.820 --> 00:33:59.460
to find someone to paint a fence. I mean there's
VolunteerMatch. Every company's hungry to

00:33:59.460 --> 00:34:04.500
find paints, fences to paint. I mean in fact
there's a great story of a non-profit in D.C.

00:34:04.500 --> 00:34:09.119
who has a room that exists solely so companies
can come in and paint it, 'cause companies

00:34:09.119 --> 00:34:13.649
are so hard up for things to paint. So they
just paint it every week a different color

00:34:13.649 --> 00:34:20.050
as different companies come in. So I think
they had, it's not often the case they actually

00:34:20.050 --> 00:34:23.690
don't have the access to that labor to dig
the ditches or painting. I think if you're

00:34:23.690 --> 00:34:26.250
able to go in at a more strategic level and
say, can I help do an assessment? You'll probably

00:34:26.250 --> 00:34:30.040
uncover it instead of saying, what can I do
just right out of the gate, 'cause they often

00:34:30.040 --> 00:34:34.620
don't know what that entry point is. The other
problem is the sector in general has a problem

00:34:34.620 --> 00:34:39.210
with people volunteering to help and then
trying to find jobs for you instead of vice

00:34:39.210 --> 00:34:42.560
versa, having them say, here's what our needs
are, and then finding the people to meet that

00:34:42.560 --> 00:34:46.760
need. And it's must easier to find people
to paint, as a general rule, because you don't

00:34:46.760 --> 00:34:50.440
have to have specific skills. It's harder
to think about where you need people otherwise.

00:34:50.440 --> 00:34:55.340
So the biggest, just to underscore, the biggest
value you can provide upfront is to say, you

00:34:55.340 --> 00:35:00.681
know, you have access through Google to 26,000
amazing people. You'd love to get more of

00:35:00.681 --> 00:35:04.850
them involved in that school. Can you help
them identify where those opportunities are

00:35:04.850 --> 00:35:09.350
so that the next time someone says, you know,
no, just paint that fence, they can say, actually

00:35:09.350 --> 00:35:12.470
we have all these other needs. So, I think
you can really help them cross that chasm.

00:35:12.470 --> 00:35:17.710
Because according to all the surveys, non-profits
consistently need skilled people way more

00:35:17.710 --> 00:35:22.360
than they need manual labor. They just don't
know how to get it or how to use it.

00:35:22.360 --> 00:35:26.590
&gt;&gt;female #7: [inaudible]

00:35:26.590 --> 00:35:34.310
&gt;&gt;Aaron Hurst: Yep. It is across a lot of
different sizes and I've seen this same data

00:35:34.310 --> 00:35:38.510
across those different, I haven't seen it
around religious organizations, but it's definitely

00:35:38.510 --> 00:35:44.050
been the case around schools, it's been around
you know non-profits of different sizes and

00:35:44.050 --> 00:35:48.290
their needs vary somewhat, but it's pretty
universal. And sometimes with schools and

00:35:48.290 --> 00:35:52.720
things that are, if they're public institutions,
so actual government organizations, they may

00:35:52.720 --> 00:35:58.119
have more rules around what they can and can't
do with volunteers, given unions, but every

00:35:58.119 --> 00:36:02.030
school I've ever interacted with like is in
desperate need for help on like all those

00:36:02.030 --> 00:36:05.270
fronts. It's a question of having the help
to manage it. And if you can go in and start

00:36:05.270 --> 00:36:08.369
with the question, let me help you manage
it by figuring out what you need, you help

00:36:08.369 --> 00:36:10.670
them unlock that potential. Yeah, Stanley.

00:36:10.670 --> 00:37:01.970
&gt;&gt;Stanley: [inaudible] pro bono work in areas
that we're not experts in [inaudible]

00:37:01.970 --> 00:37:30.530
&gt;&gt;Aaron Hurst: Yep.

00:37:30.530 --> 00:38:20.350
&gt;&gt;Stanley: 2010 when we got a marketing [inaudible]

00:38:20.350 --> 00:38:26.900
&gt;&gt;Aaron Hurst: So, thank you Stanley, that's
nice. In terms of, I guess I have to try to

00:38:26.900 --> 00:38:33.100
summarize that for the, Taproot is great,
get involved. Is that? Yeah. Ok.

00:38:33.100 --> 00:38:34.100
[laughter]

00:38:34.100 --> 00:38:37.821
&gt;&gt;Aaron Hurst: I couldn't do justice to the
full spiel there, but no, I mean I think we've

00:38:37.821 --> 00:38:41.201
really spent the last ten years creating a
model to make it really easy for you to make

00:38:41.201 --> 00:38:46.590
a difference. And really, like start with
the non-profit's needs first, so we hope that

00:38:46.590 --> 00:38:50.140
that you know is an opportunity if you guys
are interested that you would embrace, but

00:38:50.140 --> 00:38:59.380
I think there's a lot of other ways to go
about doing it. Any other? No gotcha questions?

00:38:59.380 --> 00:39:00.380
Yeah, Seth's got one. Good.

00:39:00.380 --> 00:39:01.910
&gt;&gt;Seth: [inaudible] sort of something to do
with your kids?

00:39:01.910 --> 00:39:02.910
&gt;&gt;Aaron Hurst: Yeah.

00:39:02.910 --> 00:39:05.310
&gt;&gt;Seth: Can you talk a little bit about your
kids and how you, how do you involve them

00:39:05.310 --> 00:39:15.600
in pro bono services? There are, are there
examples you see as you're leading this movement

00:39:15.600 --> 00:39:25.945
in the way in which parents involve their
kids in the service that their doing. 'Cause

00:39:25.945 --> 00:39:27.460
it's easy to go out and paint fence with my
three and a half year old, it's not as easy

00:39:27.460 --> 00:39:28.460
to involve her in a strategic [inaudible]

00:39:28.460 --> 00:39:29.460
&gt;&gt;Aaron Hurst: You're kids probably aren't
very smart, is the reason. My kids can do

00:39:29.460 --> 00:39:30.820
that, so I don't know what. I think that's
just, that's sort of your issue.

00:39:30.820 --> 00:39:31.820
[laughter]

00:39:31.820 --> 00:39:33.540
&gt;&gt;Aaron Hurst: Is there another question?

00:39:33.540 --> 00:39:34.540
[laughter]

00:39:34.540 --> 00:39:38.070
&gt;&gt;Aaron Hurst: No, no that's a great question.
I think this is one of the challenges in general

00:39:38.070 --> 00:39:42.630
of like looking at I think the broader ethic
around pro bono is about bringing, giving

00:39:42.630 --> 00:39:47.260
what you know and what you do best, right?
And obviously Seth, for you that's different

00:39:47.260 --> 00:39:52.800
than my three year old son, who is really
good at killing ants and like wrestling with

00:39:52.800 --> 00:39:57.140
kids twice his size, like those are the two
things like he's exceptionally good at. I

00:39:57.140 --> 00:40:01.950
think that there's, I think there's two different
pieces. I think there's the issue of inspiring

00:40:01.950 --> 00:40:06.801
your kids and being a role model. And thinking
about pro bono service in terms of a way to

00:40:06.801 --> 00:40:13.080
be that role model, to be that hero to them
and to have that value transmitted to them

00:40:13.080 --> 00:40:16.441
and then to find ways to have them witness
that, not just have you tell them that, so

00:40:16.441 --> 00:40:19.670
you know if you do work for a non-profit,
see if you can bring them on a site visit

00:40:19.670 --> 00:40:23.110
and show them. Because I think a lot of it's
not necessarily them serving as much as it

00:40:23.110 --> 00:40:27.100
is them seeing that you value that and that
even though you're busy, like you make time

00:40:27.100 --> 00:40:31.570
for that because you know there's always someone
less fortunate than you, no matter how bad

00:40:31.570 --> 00:40:36.369
your circumstance is. I think that's incredibly
powerful as just a transmission of values.

00:40:36.369 --> 00:40:40.044
I think the second piece is around them actually
doing service. And I think you have to be

00:40:40.044 --> 00:40:43.800
really careful there again to not patronize
the non-profit sector, 'cause the sector's

00:40:43.800 --> 00:40:48.620
not like hard up for seven year olds to come
paint fences, like that's not really what

00:40:48.620 --> 00:40:51.950
they're looking for, but at the same time
I think there are ways to think about what

00:40:51.950 --> 00:40:56.770
do your kids love to do? And often helping
other kids that are younger than them, like

00:40:56.770 --> 00:41:00.800
my daughter loves doing projects. She likes
painting, she likes beading, she likes doing

00:41:00.800 --> 00:41:05.250
all kinds of stuff and her school does a great
job of getting kids that are like a couple

00:41:05.250 --> 00:41:09.140
grades older to come down and like teach the
kids how to do those things that they love

00:41:09.140 --> 00:41:12.311
to do, whether it's reading, what have you,
which to me is instilling at an early age

00:41:12.311 --> 00:41:17.170
that same idea of taking what you love, what
you know how to do well and bringing that

00:41:17.170 --> 00:41:24.770
to, to others in sort of that sense. But it's
a, no it's an interesting challenge. I had

00:41:24.770 --> 00:41:27.850
the same impulse too. It's like I want to,
you have a Saturday, you want to like go figure

00:41:27.850 --> 00:41:34.380
out how to do something that you feel like
is transmitting real value. And you know I

00:41:34.380 --> 00:41:38.359
think for some of that stuff, to be candid,
some of the direct service stuff is easier

00:41:38.359 --> 00:41:43.109
for that. I think the challenge is, like it
puts the onus on the non-profits to have to

00:41:43.109 --> 00:41:48.460
host you and that kid, because very few volunteer
activities really are best suited for especially

00:41:48.460 --> 00:41:55.430
smaller children. I think as they get older,
that tends to vary, so, I don't know. But

00:41:55.430 --> 00:41:59.660
my, my daughter is a bad ass, so she's got,
she's got, we live in Brooklyn and she's got

00:41:59.660 --> 00:42:03.490
a lemonade stand that she puts up pretty regularly.
I'm doing a documentary on it, 'cause it's

00:42:03.490 --> 00:42:08.120
just been like such an amazing business. She
brings in like 25 bucks an hour at 50 cents

00:42:08.120 --> 00:42:09.120
a glass.

00:42:09.120 --> 00:42:10.120
[laughter]

00:42:10.120 --> 00:42:14.060
&gt;&gt;Aaron Hurst: Like that's a scalable amazing
business and like it's like it's phenomenal,

00:42:14.060 --> 00:42:16.030
like I think a couple of the local bars are
like worried they're gonna have to go out

00:42:16.030 --> 00:42:20.480
of business soon because of like the amount
of business she's been taking, so. She's not

00:42:20.480 --> 00:42:23.820
that far off at five I think from being able
to do some business strategy for you guys

00:42:23.820 --> 00:42:24.820
here.

00:42:24.820 --> 00:42:25.820
[laughter]

00:42:25.820 --> 00:42:29.940
&gt;&gt;Aaron Hurst: Any final questions? Yeah,
Seth.

00:42:29.940 --> 00:42:39.070
&gt;&gt;Seth: I'm also [inaudible] so we get a lot
of people who say, I wanna do something different

00:42:39.070 --> 00:42:43.510
than my, what I do during my day job [inaudible]

00:42:43.510 --> 00:42:44.840
&gt;&gt;Aaron Hurst: Yep.

00:42:44.840 --> 00:42:50.211
&gt;&gt;Seth: You talked about the present value
of service, you talked about the [inaudible]

00:42:50.211 --> 00:42:51.211
You must get that often where people say,
like, I get it, I know that my skills are

00:42:51.211 --> 00:42:52.590
more valuable doing what I'm professionally
good at, but I work 60 hours a week doing

00:42:52.590 --> 00:42:54.609
that and I want to do something different
when I'm doing my service time.

00:42:54.609 --> 00:42:59.200
&gt;&gt;Aaron Hurst: I'd fire 'em. Like if they
don't love their job and what they do enough

00:42:59.200 --> 00:43:02.580
to wanna like do that in the community, like
they clearly aren't very good at what they

00:43:02.580 --> 00:43:07.350
do. That's my sense of it. But, no I think
it has to, I think there are people who really

00:43:07.350 --> 00:43:11.050
are trying to like use it as an escapism,
right? But I think, you know I think there

00:43:11.050 --> 00:43:14.040
is that percentage of the population, but
I find though consistently is when people

00:43:14.040 --> 00:43:18.461
actually go and use their skills and do it
in a completely different setting that it

00:43:18.461 --> 00:43:22.810
turns them upside down. They're surprised
by how much they love that and how it feels

00:43:22.810 --> 00:43:27.690
very different from work. And I think it's,
you know you talk about, I talked with my

00:43:27.690 --> 00:43:31.110
executive coach about sort of in life you
need your three places. You've got your family,

00:43:31.110 --> 00:43:35.610
you've got your work and then you need that
third place. And I think you know often people

00:43:35.610 --> 00:43:37.980
are looking for that third place and their
looking at like I don't wanna do this stuff

00:43:37.980 --> 00:43:41.910
at work, I want a third place. But I think
what I've seen is that people actually have

00:43:41.910 --> 00:43:46.619
a much more rewarding third place when they
bring their whole selves to that experience.

00:43:46.619 --> 00:43:50.550
They're not checking out their brain, they're
not checking out like you know their intellectual

00:43:50.550 --> 00:43:53.890
passion, they're bringing that fully to the
full. So it's counterintuitive at first because

00:43:53.890 --> 00:43:58.200
they're like trying to create a place away
from work. They're trying to carve out that

00:43:58.200 --> 00:44:05.170
third place. But realizing that their love
for marketing or coding or HR, they've often

00:44:05.170 --> 00:44:08.990
never had the chance to express that in a
non-commercial setting and realize how radically

00:44:08.990 --> 00:44:12.570
different that feels when you're doing it
in that kind of environment and I can't tell

00:44:12.570 --> 00:44:16.200
you the number of times like people said it's
the most rewarding experience in their career.

00:44:16.200 --> 00:44:20.350
How many times people feel like they've learned
like ways to do things in completely different

00:44:20.350 --> 00:44:23.560
ways. It's changed their identity 'cause they
go from thinking marketing as a commercial

00:44:23.560 --> 00:44:27.440
thing to suddenly realizing that you know
they are marketing or technology that doesn't

00:44:27.440 --> 00:44:30.770
mean that they're a business professional.
It means that they are a marketing professional

00:44:30.770 --> 00:44:35.369
and that can be translated in a lot of different
ways, so my short answer, besides fire them,

00:44:35.369 --> 00:44:39.901
would be tell them just to try it and tell
them that non-profit, tell them non-profits

00:44:39.901 --> 00:44:43.880
are so hard up for this stuff, they've got
plenty of people to paint a fence, like they're

00:44:43.880 --> 00:44:48.760
hard up for these needs. Try it and see how
it feels. And you know, not everything's for

00:44:48.760 --> 00:44:52.120
everybody, but I'm surprised at the number
of people that have that sentiment and then

00:44:52.120 --> 00:45:04.010
sort of had that turned around. Yeah. [pause]
Any final heckling? Well, thank you all for

00:45:04.010 --> 00:45:08.080
making the time, I know you guys are incredibly
busy. And you know sharing your lunch hour

00:45:08.080 --> 00:45:11.210
with me. I hope, you know, a lot of you are
able to get involved with Taproot, get involved

00:45:11.210 --> 00:45:16.161
in other ways. Remember the present value
of service and remember that while it's easy

00:45:16.161 --> 00:45:20.930
to always say tomorrow's gonna be an easier
day to do it, you never know what's gonna

00:45:20.930 --> 00:45:25.570
be tomorrow, so you may as well start today.
So I just encourage you to go to our website,

00:45:25.570 --> 00:45:29.530
look at the stories, either sign up, find
a, you know, reasons for motivation through

00:45:29.530 --> 00:45:34.150
that and show your, show your kids what you're
doing. Show them how you are making a difference

00:45:34.150 --> 00:45:38.490
and be a role model to them and really hold
that as your, you know your, the bar for you

00:45:38.490 --> 00:45:42.130
and your career and your life is to be that
role model you want to be. So, thank you.

00:45:42.130 --> 00:45:42.380
