MALE SPEAKER: Good afternoon.

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:06.480
Let's welcome Chef Daniel
Patterson, owner of Coi,

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:11.050
Plum, Plum Bar, Haven, and the
forthcoming Alta California

00:00:11.050 --> 00:00:15.990
restaurant in San Francisco's
Mid-Market Neighborhood.

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:19.580
He's also the author of the
recently released "Coi, Stories

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:24.260
and Recipes from the
Kitchen," "Aroma,

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:29.680
The Magic of Essential Oils
in Foods and Fragrances."

00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:34.635
He is also a noted writer on
food in the kitchen and beyond,

00:00:34.635 --> 00:00:36.510
and has written for a
number of publications,

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:40.010
including "Lucky Peach" and
"The New York Times Magazine."

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:42.508
Let's give a round of
applause for Chef Patterson.

00:00:42.508 --> 00:00:45.769
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:45.769 --> 00:00:47.810
MALE SPEAKER: I'm going
to let you take the helm.

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:50.720
And you're going to do a
little presentation discussing

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:52.629
your book, which
is pretty exciting.

00:00:52.629 --> 00:00:53.670
DANIEL PATTERSON: Thanks.

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:54.980
MALE SPEAKER: We look
forward to hearing you.

00:00:54.980 --> 00:00:57.080
DANIEL PATTERSON:
Thank you very much.

00:00:57.080 --> 00:01:01.960
Thanks so much for coming down.

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:03.760
As he said, I have
a little restaurant

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:07.690
in San Francisco called Coi.

00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:09.650
My background is
I started working

00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:12.390
in restaurants when I was 14.

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:14.980
I was a dishwasher
and then a prep cook.

00:01:14.980 --> 00:01:17.489
And then I worked my way up.

00:01:17.489 --> 00:01:19.280
I opened my first
restaurant when I was 25.

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:20.530
I had a couple of restaurants.

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:23.330
And then I opened Coi in 2006.

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:28.150
One question I get a lot of
is Coi, what does it mean?

00:01:28.150 --> 00:01:30.500
And so it's an
archaic French word.

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:31.940
They ask for where
did I find it.

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:36.617
I found it on the internet in
a search engine, basically.

00:01:36.617 --> 00:01:38.200
It's an archaic
French word that means

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:41.410
tranquil or quiet, from
the Latin root quietus.

00:01:41.410 --> 00:01:44.380
It hasn't really been used
since the Middle Ages.

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:48.330
It transferred to Middle
English and became

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:55.770
coy, C-O-Y. While coi
fell out of favor,

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:57.145
quietus became anglicized.

00:01:57.145 --> 00:01:58.270
It's not that nice of word.

00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:01.240
To bring quietus to
someone means to kill them.

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:05.430
And then it's very
close to koi, K-O-I,

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:07.181
which is like a Japanese carp.

00:02:07.181 --> 00:02:09.139
So to this day, people
come into our restaurant

00:02:09.139 --> 00:02:12.350
every once in awhile
wondering where the sushi is.

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:16.190
So I picked a name
for the restaurant

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:18.121
that no one knew what it meant.

00:02:18.121 --> 00:02:19.870
It hasn't been used
for hundreds of years.

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:21.203
No one knew how to pronounce it.

00:02:21.203 --> 00:02:22.910
And it's very like another name.

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:25.110
And so they were
always very confused.

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:29.660
Which was actually a
monumental failure of branding,

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:33.009
but it turns out that it
was pretty accurate for what

00:02:33.009 --> 00:02:35.050
the restaurant was to
become, which was something

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:37.895
that I didn't
realize at the time,

00:02:37.895 --> 00:02:41.540
but we crossed a lot of
categories of things.

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:46.460
And I'd like to think we've
brought a little clarity to it.

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:47.850
But I'm not sure.

00:02:55.742 --> 00:03:00.080
I guess the restaurant really
started in my mind in 2005.

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:02.657
So I was in between jobs.

00:03:02.657 --> 00:03:04.365
When I say in between
jobs, I really only

00:03:04.365 --> 00:03:05.975
had one job in
the last 20 years.

00:03:05.975 --> 00:03:07.850
I've owned my own
restaurants except one time

00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:11.340
I tried to take a job
and then I got fired.

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:12.810
And I couldn't find another one.

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:15.370
And so in the
summer of 2005, I'm

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:18.000
from Massachusetts originally.

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:20.740
And I moved out here
in 1989, a month

00:03:20.740 --> 00:03:23.550
before the earthquake--
had nothing to do with it.

00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:29.200
And after 16 years,
I couldn't figure out

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:32.440
exactly my place here.

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:35.840
And at that time, I
was dating someone

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:37.470
who would then become my wife.

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:39.720
And I had a lot of
time on my hands.

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:42.860
So during that time, her
mother was very sick.

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:44.460
She had cancer.

00:03:44.460 --> 00:03:47.170
And we went up to
visit her a lot.

00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:49.220
Her mother lived in the
foothills of the Sierra

00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:50.980
Nevadas, about 4 and
1/2 hours northeast.

00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:52.771
And I don't know if
you've ever been there,

00:03:52.771 --> 00:03:54.070
but it's incredibly beautiful.

00:03:54.070 --> 00:03:56.672
It's like completely
untouched by people.

00:03:56.672 --> 00:03:58.880
There's more animals, I
think, than there are people.

00:03:58.880 --> 00:04:00.213
Her mother was an archaeologist.

00:04:00.213 --> 00:04:03.800
And she studied Native
American culture, especially

00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:04.570
the Maidu tribe.

00:04:04.570 --> 00:04:07.660
And so if you were going
to build a house, say,

00:04:07.660 --> 00:04:11.700
on a land where nothing had ever
been, you would contact her.

00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:15.524
And she would go and make sure
it wasn't a special place.

00:04:15.524 --> 00:04:17.899
And so while we were there,
we would take a lot of walks.

00:04:17.899 --> 00:04:21.060
And she would show me
plants and other things

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:24.060
that I didn't think
were edible-- trees,

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:26.110
acorns, all kinds
of things that have

00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:28.380
been eaten for
thousands of years.

00:04:28.380 --> 00:04:30.270
So California's pretty new.

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:31.980
So California's been
around 150 years.

00:04:31.980 --> 00:04:33.420
Before that, it was Mexico.

00:04:33.420 --> 00:04:36.800
People have been living in
California thousands of years.

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:39.090
And so somehow, when
I was talking to her,

00:04:39.090 --> 00:04:43.340
I started to understand
this place where I lived.

00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:45.210
I knew almost nothing about it.

00:04:45.210 --> 00:04:48.580
All I knew was really
the last 50 years.

00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:50.330
And so I started to
study a little bit.

00:04:50.330 --> 00:04:53.010
And then one day, I got a call.

00:04:53.010 --> 00:04:54.790
I was down in Santa
Cruz with a friend.

00:04:54.790 --> 00:04:56.915
My wife called and said,
you've got to get up here.

00:04:56.915 --> 00:04:58.210
And so I did.

00:04:58.210 --> 00:04:58.900
And I got there.

00:04:58.900 --> 00:04:59.816
Her mother had passed.

00:04:59.816 --> 00:05:01.550
And it was this
incredible moment

00:05:01.550 --> 00:05:04.900
where I had no idea what to say.

00:05:04.900 --> 00:05:07.200
It was this very
powerful reaction

00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:09.880
when I opened the door, this
grief, which was so palpable.

00:05:09.880 --> 00:05:13.000
And I had no idea what to do.

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:14.480
But everyone was hungry.

00:05:14.480 --> 00:05:15.630
And I knew how to cook.

00:05:15.630 --> 00:05:17.290
So I started cooking.

00:05:17.290 --> 00:05:23.230
And she was there, her sister,
her mother's best friend,

00:05:23.230 --> 00:05:24.660
and her mother's partner.

00:05:24.660 --> 00:05:27.930
And for four days, I cooked
breakfast, lunch, and dinner.

00:05:27.930 --> 00:05:30.860
And restaurants
are a funny thing.

00:05:30.860 --> 00:05:33.232
It's like you're feeding
people, but there's

00:05:33.232 --> 00:05:35.190
an element about them,
and especially if you're

00:05:35.190 --> 00:05:39.420
cooking very high-end food,
which was always what I did,

00:05:39.420 --> 00:05:41.890
it's about consistency.

00:05:41.890 --> 00:05:44.310
And it's about this
level of professionalism

00:05:44.310 --> 00:05:49.250
that sometimes you lose
track a little bit of what

00:05:49.250 --> 00:05:51.310
it means to cook for someone.

00:05:51.310 --> 00:05:54.550
And that's what I thought
about, what it means to cook--

00:05:54.550 --> 00:05:56.650
So that was where
I started thinking

00:05:56.650 --> 00:05:59.270
about what I wanted Coi to be.

00:05:59.270 --> 00:06:01.720
I remember it very
distinctly, sitting there

00:06:01.720 --> 00:06:07.470
in my fiance's mother's
house with her crappy stove,

00:06:07.470 --> 00:06:09.570
going through her
pots and pans trying

00:06:09.570 --> 00:06:12.650
to find something that
wasn't hopelessly dented,

00:06:12.650 --> 00:06:15.780
and going through her
cupboards, and going to the one

00:06:15.780 --> 00:06:18.474
local store that
there was, thinking

00:06:18.474 --> 00:06:20.140
about what it means
to cook for someone.

00:06:20.140 --> 00:06:25.030
So when I started Coi, I wanted
something very small, very

00:06:25.030 --> 00:06:28.830
personal, and something that
felt a little bit like you're

00:06:28.830 --> 00:06:30.740
going into someone's house.

00:06:30.740 --> 00:06:34.080
And so that's what we opened.

00:06:34.080 --> 00:06:36.445
It's in a terrible neighborhood.

00:06:36.445 --> 00:06:37.820
I don't think I
could have chosen

00:06:37.820 --> 00:06:40.210
a worse location in retrospect.

00:06:40.210 --> 00:06:43.230
But it's in North Beach.

00:06:43.230 --> 00:06:45.060
It's also next to a strip club.

00:06:45.060 --> 00:06:49.517
So for three years, at
least every single review,

00:06:49.517 --> 00:06:51.350
the first line was,
it's next to-- I'm like,

00:06:51.350 --> 00:06:55.060
there's actually more to
the restaurant than that.

00:06:55.060 --> 00:06:56.230
Fine.

00:06:56.230 --> 00:06:59.950
But North Beach is one
of my favorite places,

00:06:59.950 --> 00:07:02.500
I would say my favorite
place in San Francisco.

00:07:02.500 --> 00:07:05.800
So down the street-- so in
the corner of that picture

00:07:05.800 --> 00:07:09.760
is City Lights Bookstore,
Lawrence Ferlinghetti.

00:07:09.760 --> 00:07:13.510
Across the street is
Tosca and Vesuvio.

00:07:13.510 --> 00:07:16.800
I mean, this is where the
beat poets used to hang out.

00:07:16.800 --> 00:07:21.500
Down the street from
that is Carol Doda, who

00:07:21.500 --> 00:07:25.390
was this incredibly
famous burlesque performer

00:07:25.390 --> 00:07:27.020
with these great
stories that came out

00:07:27.020 --> 00:07:30.440
of this place, The
Condor, like the couple

00:07:30.440 --> 00:07:32.985
that was having sex on the
piano, the hydraulic piano that

00:07:32.985 --> 00:07:35.110
broke, and they just kind
of went up to the ceiling

00:07:35.110 --> 00:07:36.780
and trapped them there.

00:07:36.780 --> 00:07:40.700
I mean, The Hungry Eye,
which was Enrico Banducci.

00:07:40.700 --> 00:07:42.730
Lenny Bruce used to
play there in the '50s.

00:07:42.730 --> 00:07:43.800
And Woody Allen.

00:07:43.800 --> 00:07:46.980
There was The Jazz Workshop
where Thelonius Monk recorded

00:07:46.980 --> 00:07:48.380
one of his most famous albums.

00:07:48.380 --> 00:07:53.290
The whole area has been
this foment of creativity

00:07:53.290 --> 00:07:54.040
for so many years.

00:07:54.040 --> 00:07:56.050
It's become something
a little different now.

00:07:56.050 --> 00:07:59.050
But for me, it still
has a little bit

00:07:59.050 --> 00:08:00.580
of that spirit to it.

00:08:00.580 --> 00:08:03.289
And so we're on the edge of
North Beach, Telegraph Hill,

00:08:03.289 --> 00:08:04.080
and Jackson Square.

00:08:04.080 --> 00:08:08.200
So Jackson Square used to be
the edge of San Francisco.

00:08:08.200 --> 00:08:12.120
And so it's a part of the
city that's easy to get to.

00:08:12.120 --> 00:08:15.300
It's kind of central, but also
historically in San Francisco.

00:08:15.300 --> 00:08:18.880
It's got a lot of
substance to it.

00:08:18.880 --> 00:08:27.170
And so when we opened, I
knew that the restaurant

00:08:27.170 --> 00:08:29.704
had to fit into the community.

00:08:29.704 --> 00:08:31.120
And so I thought
a lot about that.

00:08:31.120 --> 00:08:32.870
I'm like, well, how
am I going to do this?

00:08:32.870 --> 00:08:35.985
So one thing I thought is using
a lot of the wild ingredients

00:08:35.985 --> 00:08:38.580
that I'd been learning about.

00:08:38.580 --> 00:08:41.010
I wanted to cook for
San Franciscans, people

00:08:41.010 --> 00:08:42.500
who grew up here.

00:08:42.500 --> 00:08:47.510
And if you imagine taking a
walk and brushing by or just

00:08:47.510 --> 00:08:51.210
being near a wild bay tree, like
California bay in the summer

00:08:51.210 --> 00:08:54.390
and that kind of menthol,
eucalyptus aroma,

00:08:54.390 --> 00:08:56.620
and then bringing that
into the dining room,

00:08:56.620 --> 00:09:00.040
that sense of place, very
vividly on their plate.

00:09:00.040 --> 00:09:01.520
That's one thing I thought of.

00:09:01.520 --> 00:09:03.660
And then I wanted to
use the best ingredients

00:09:03.660 --> 00:09:04.890
that we have here.

00:09:04.890 --> 00:09:08.360
So I'm only going to use
local ingredients that

00:09:08.360 --> 00:09:09.930
are recognizable.

00:09:09.930 --> 00:09:11.210
So that means mostly plants.

00:09:11.210 --> 00:09:13.270
That's our best ingredient.

00:09:13.270 --> 00:09:15.550
It means there's not
a lot of fin fish.

00:09:15.550 --> 00:09:19.021
So I wrote a whole book with no
fin fish in it, only shellfish.

00:09:19.021 --> 00:09:20.770
It means a lot of wild
plants, but it also

00:09:20.770 --> 00:09:25.040
means lot of cultivated stuff
and meats raised on grass.

00:09:25.040 --> 00:09:29.870
And people that I'd dealt with
her for 10, 15 years, producers

00:09:29.870 --> 00:09:34.800
like Soyoung Scanlon, who is,
I think, probably the best

00:09:34.800 --> 00:09:37.440
cheesemaker in the country who
does all of our cheese for us.

00:09:37.440 --> 00:09:44.690
So bringing in people who had
a lot of meaning to the area,

00:09:44.690 --> 00:09:47.110
to me, and bringing
that into the food.

00:09:49.720 --> 00:09:52.100
And then, it's funny,
this idea of local.

00:09:52.100 --> 00:09:58.740
Back then this idea
of Californial cuisine

00:09:58.740 --> 00:10:00.000
didn't really exist.

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:03.009
So then this idea like even
more that we would work only

00:10:03.009 --> 00:10:04.550
with local ingredients--
at that time

00:10:04.550 --> 00:10:10.400
there was pretty much a kind of
a schism between haute cuisine,

00:10:10.400 --> 00:10:13.650
like very high in food,
and then casual food.

00:10:13.650 --> 00:10:15.150
And we kind of
scrambled everything.

00:10:15.150 --> 00:10:17.145
Restaurants are a
lot about symbolism.

00:10:17.145 --> 00:10:19.520
And so we took the
symbols from both things

00:10:19.520 --> 00:10:21.610
and mixed them together.

00:10:21.610 --> 00:10:25.550
We have fuzzy pillows
and nubbly fabrics

00:10:25.550 --> 00:10:29.120
on our banquettes,
handmade pottery,

00:10:29.120 --> 00:10:31.620
a lot of things that
really were associated

00:10:31.620 --> 00:10:33.800
with the more rustic
style of food.

00:10:33.800 --> 00:10:39.850
But we served a highly
personal tasting menu at a time

00:10:39.850 --> 00:10:43.900
when there was no highly
personal modern cooking

00:10:43.900 --> 00:10:44.400
in the city.

00:10:44.400 --> 00:10:47.710
And there really
wasn't a lot of idea

00:10:47.710 --> 00:10:50.377
that there was a need for it.

00:10:50.377 --> 00:10:52.960
And all my friends called me and
they were like, you're crazy.

00:10:52.960 --> 00:10:54.680
You're going to go
out of business.

00:10:54.680 --> 00:10:57.250
And we almost did for
the first two years.

00:10:57.250 --> 00:10:58.790
It was really hard.

00:10:58.790 --> 00:11:01.455
But what was
interesting to me was--

00:11:01.455 --> 00:11:04.320
so there's this great
movie from 2003.

00:11:04.320 --> 00:11:08.320
Lars von Trier made a movie
called "The Five Obstructions."

00:11:08.320 --> 00:11:10.720
And the premise is
kind of a documentary.

00:11:10.720 --> 00:11:14.550
And there's a very
famous older filmmaker,

00:11:14.550 --> 00:11:16.890
a Danish filmmaker
called Jorgen Leth.

00:11:16.890 --> 00:11:21.370
And the premise was he'd kind
have gotten a little depressed.

00:11:21.370 --> 00:11:23.860
He'd kind of lost a
little bit of his spirit.

00:11:23.860 --> 00:11:29.550
And Lars when to him and said,
I want to do a movie together.

00:11:29.550 --> 00:11:32.790
I want you to re-make your
most famous movie, which

00:11:32.790 --> 00:11:33.945
was from 1967.

00:11:33.945 --> 00:11:35.865
It's called "The Perfect Human."

00:11:35.865 --> 00:11:37.490
And I want you to
re-make it five times

00:11:37.490 --> 00:11:39.330
with each time with
an obstruction.

00:11:39.330 --> 00:11:42.200
Obstruction meaning
like the first time,

00:11:42.200 --> 00:11:45.240
I want you to remake
the movie, but left

00:11:45.240 --> 00:11:47.380
like long, langerish shots.

00:11:47.380 --> 00:11:52.100
He's like, each cut needs
to be only 12 frames,

00:11:52.100 --> 00:11:54.160
which is like [SNAP] [SNAP].

00:11:54.160 --> 00:11:56.580
And what was amazing
was he did it.

00:11:56.580 --> 00:12:01.020
And he did it somehow
with his voice,

00:12:01.020 --> 00:12:04.230
with his honest
expression intact.

00:12:04.230 --> 00:12:05.320
It was extraordinary.

00:12:05.320 --> 00:12:11.090
And that's how I
felt about working

00:12:11.090 --> 00:12:13.710
with this tight
constriction of ingredients,

00:12:13.710 --> 00:12:17.640
is that it really
forced creativity.

00:12:17.640 --> 00:12:22.210
Because it's easy enough to put
a bunch of caviar on a plate

00:12:22.210 --> 00:12:23.624
and have people be happy.

00:12:23.624 --> 00:12:25.040
But if you're going
to give people

00:12:25.040 --> 00:12:26.456
a carrot instead
of caviar, it has

00:12:26.456 --> 00:12:29.070
to be a really fucking
good carrot, you know?

00:12:29.070 --> 00:12:32.520
And so that was from
the very beginning

00:12:32.520 --> 00:12:34.466
the foundation of
our cooking, is

00:12:34.466 --> 00:12:36.090
that we're going to
start with a carrot

00:12:36.090 --> 00:12:37.740
and make it as good as caviar.

00:12:37.740 --> 00:12:39.960
And we worked really hard at it.

00:12:39.960 --> 00:12:46.181
I think now it's almost
eight years later.

00:12:46.181 --> 00:12:47.680
I think our restaurant
as come to be

00:12:47.680 --> 00:12:50.180
known a lot for creativity.

00:12:50.180 --> 00:12:54.820
And I guess I have three
thoughts about creativity.

00:12:54.820 --> 00:12:59.076
One is that creativity
is the pursuit of truth.

00:12:59.076 --> 00:13:04.710
And I think at its
best, something

00:13:04.710 --> 00:13:08.990
that is creative and
successful reveals something

00:13:08.990 --> 00:13:14.140
that is essentially true about
a form, about an ingredient,

00:13:14.140 --> 00:13:17.607
about a person, about
something universal.

00:13:17.607 --> 00:13:19.690
I think the second thing
is that creativity is not

00:13:19.690 --> 00:13:20.880
an end in itself.

00:13:20.880 --> 00:13:23.460
It's there only to
discover something.

00:13:23.460 --> 00:13:26.460
So creativity is taking
form that's known

00:13:26.460 --> 00:13:29.670
and reshaping it so
it does something new,

00:13:29.670 --> 00:13:35.680
not to do something new, but to
discover something that's true.

00:13:35.680 --> 00:13:37.780
And then I think the other
thing about creativity

00:13:37.780 --> 00:13:40.030
is it requires courage.

00:13:40.030 --> 00:13:42.969
And courage is like a word that
seems really old-fashioned.

00:13:42.969 --> 00:13:44.510
I don't think anyone
uses it anymore.

00:13:44.510 --> 00:13:47.180
I don't think anyone's used
it probably in 20 years.

00:13:47.180 --> 00:13:48.600
And it sounds kind of stilted.

00:13:48.600 --> 00:13:51.120
But for me, it
has meaning still.

00:13:51.120 --> 00:13:53.454
So when I was a
kid, I learned how

00:13:53.454 --> 00:13:55.120
to speak French when
I was pretty young.

00:13:55.120 --> 00:13:57.100
And somehow, I think I
was in seventh grade,

00:13:57.100 --> 00:13:59.340
I ended up in a
French class that

00:13:59.340 --> 00:14:01.564
was a little bit
below where I was.

00:14:01.564 --> 00:14:02.480
And I was bored stiff.

00:14:02.480 --> 00:14:04.130
So there was this
poster on the wall,

00:14:04.130 --> 00:14:05.546
and I memorized
it because I think

00:14:05.546 --> 00:14:08.969
I read it 10,000 times because
I couldn't pay attention

00:14:08.969 --> 00:14:09.510
in the class.

00:14:09.510 --> 00:14:13.930
And it was a picture of
Robert Kennedy getting off

00:14:13.930 --> 00:14:16.290
of a plane and this great quote.

00:14:16.290 --> 00:14:18.302
And I always remembered it.

00:14:18.302 --> 00:14:21.950
The answer of the world's hope
is to rely on youth, not a time

00:14:21.950 --> 00:14:25.600
in life, but a state of
mind, temper of the will,

00:14:25.600 --> 00:14:28.500
quality of the
imagination, predominance

00:14:28.500 --> 00:14:31.400
of courage over timidity,
and the love of adventure

00:14:31.400 --> 00:14:33.890
over the life of ease.

00:14:33.890 --> 00:14:37.580
And I kind of always remembered
it, the predominance of courage

00:14:37.580 --> 00:14:43.850
over timidity, because I think a
lot of people feel like courage

00:14:43.850 --> 00:14:45.910
is not being afraid.

00:14:45.910 --> 00:14:49.820
And I think it is being afraid
and doing something anyway.

00:14:49.820 --> 00:14:53.720
Creativity requires risk.

00:14:53.720 --> 00:14:56.320
And risk necessitates failure.

00:14:56.320 --> 00:14:58.530
I think the best thing
we've done at Coi,

00:14:58.530 --> 00:15:01.090
the thing I'm most proud
of, is we failed a lot.

00:15:01.090 --> 00:15:02.800
That sounds terrible.

00:15:02.800 --> 00:15:06.060
But I don't think
that a person has

00:15:06.060 --> 00:15:10.380
been invented that can
take risks without failing.

00:15:10.380 --> 00:15:11.885
And that's definitely not me.

00:15:11.885 --> 00:15:14.385
And so one of the things that
we did a lot at the restaurant

00:15:14.385 --> 00:15:18.690
is we failed over and over
because we were trying

00:15:18.690 --> 00:15:23.940
to evolve a culinary
language that was ours,

00:15:23.940 --> 00:15:26.150
that seemed like our expression.

00:15:26.150 --> 00:15:28.520
And it took a lot of work.

00:15:28.520 --> 00:15:34.240
And there was a lot of
times where, I have to say,

00:15:34.240 --> 00:15:37.564
it was a little bit nuts.

00:15:37.564 --> 00:15:38.980
I was getting all
the ingredients.

00:15:38.980 --> 00:15:39.940
I was doing all the foraging.

00:15:39.940 --> 00:15:41.090
I was writing the menus.

00:15:41.090 --> 00:15:42.030
And I was cooking.

00:15:42.030 --> 00:15:46.250
And it's funny because
a lot of good chefs

00:15:46.250 --> 00:15:47.670
have come out of our kitchen.

00:15:47.670 --> 00:15:48.930
And I'm really proud of that.

00:15:48.930 --> 00:15:53.100
And it's funny to go
back and talk to them.

00:15:53.100 --> 00:15:55.590
From the early years,
the people who,

00:15:55.590 --> 00:15:58.670
when we worked together there,
we just laugh about some

00:15:58.670 --> 00:15:59.380
of the stories.

00:15:59.380 --> 00:16:04.190
Like I was putting like 150 new
dishes on the menu a year, 200.

00:16:04.190 --> 00:16:06.400
It was just this
constant, constant thing.

00:16:06.400 --> 00:16:07.560
They weren't all good.

00:16:07.560 --> 00:16:10.500
And sometimes I'd
be like, OK, we're

00:16:10.500 --> 00:16:12.660
going to change four
dishes tomorrow.

00:16:12.660 --> 00:16:14.280
And my sous chef
kind of, ahem, Chef,

00:16:14.280 --> 00:16:16.670
you remember like
last time, you told me

00:16:16.670 --> 00:16:18.992
that last time it
didn't go so well.

00:16:18.992 --> 00:16:20.700
And you told me to
tell you the next time

00:16:20.700 --> 00:16:21.860
that you shouldn't
change four dishes.

00:16:21.860 --> 00:16:23.234
And I was like,
no, no, this time

00:16:23.234 --> 00:16:25.930
it's really going to go well.

00:16:25.930 --> 00:16:29.550
And so what happened
was it really

00:16:29.550 --> 00:16:36.200
did take seven years to
discover what was our language.

00:16:36.200 --> 00:16:40.600
And then when I
finally wrote the book,

00:16:40.600 --> 00:16:44.300
what the book ended
up being was a story

00:16:44.300 --> 00:16:49.850
about that process, a
story about discovery.

00:16:49.850 --> 00:16:55.050
So I brought a few slides.

00:16:55.050 --> 00:16:58.110
And we're right near
Chinatown, which

00:16:58.110 --> 00:17:01.165
is like my other favorite
part of San Francisco.

00:17:04.359 --> 00:17:07.396
And this is our alley.

00:17:07.396 --> 00:17:09.270
I brought a couple
pictures just to show you.

00:17:09.270 --> 00:17:12.760
Our restaurant is like,
for me, it's super warm.

00:17:12.760 --> 00:17:16.869
And at its best,
it's a place where

00:17:16.869 --> 00:17:18.569
I want people to
have a good time.

00:17:18.569 --> 00:17:20.510
I don't want them
to feel like they

00:17:20.510 --> 00:17:22.460
have to talk in hushed voices.

00:17:22.460 --> 00:17:24.569
It's not a temple
of fine dining.

00:17:24.569 --> 00:17:29.860
It's a place for people
to enjoy the table.

00:17:29.860 --> 00:17:35.510
Because food, like
cooking, is like one

00:17:35.510 --> 00:17:37.670
of the most human things we do.

00:17:37.670 --> 00:17:40.220
We cook reach other, for
ourselves, for families,

00:17:40.220 --> 00:17:42.310
for our friends.

00:17:42.310 --> 00:17:46.260
The emotion of the table,
sharing stories and experiences

00:17:46.260 --> 00:17:50.160
together, and how that makes
us feel about our community

00:17:50.160 --> 00:17:53.580
and about where we live,
is the most central thing.

00:17:53.580 --> 00:17:56.146
And so every day when we
come into the restaurant--

00:17:56.146 --> 00:17:58.020
and I'll probably say
"we" a lot and it's not

00:17:58.020 --> 00:18:00.890
because I'm using the "royal
we" but because we have

00:18:00.890 --> 00:18:03.910
a lot of people who
work in the restaurant,

00:18:03.910 --> 00:18:06.250
a lot of people considering
how small the restaurant is,

00:18:06.250 --> 00:18:08.940
and everyone, I think,
feels the same way.

00:18:08.940 --> 00:18:14.000
And everyone feels
like when I opened,

00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:16.596
I said, OK, all we're going to
think about is the people that

00:18:16.596 --> 00:18:17.720
come in the door every day.

00:18:17.720 --> 00:18:20.600
That's who is the most important
people in the world to us.

00:18:20.600 --> 00:18:23.770
We never think about
press or awards.

00:18:23.770 --> 00:18:24.770
That's not why we cook.

00:18:24.770 --> 00:18:26.870
We cook for the
people who come in.

00:18:26.870 --> 00:18:29.260
And I think to this
day that has remained

00:18:29.260 --> 00:18:32.242
the most central tenet
in the restaurant.

00:18:32.242 --> 00:18:34.200
I want people to the come
in, have a good time,

00:18:34.200 --> 00:18:37.470
feel very comfortable.

00:18:37.470 --> 00:18:42.820
And you can see, the kitchen is
right next to the dining room.

00:18:42.820 --> 00:18:46.790
So I brought a few slides to
talk about some of the food

00:18:46.790 --> 00:18:51.770
and use that as a way to talk
about how we evolve dishes,

00:18:51.770 --> 00:18:53.880
some of the ideas,
and some of the,

00:18:53.880 --> 00:18:55.840
I guess, philosophical
aspects of how we cook.

00:18:55.840 --> 00:19:01.650
So more than wild ingredients
and local ingredients,

00:19:01.650 --> 00:19:06.650
I also wanted to
understand and incorporate

00:19:06.650 --> 00:19:10.720
a lot of tropes that
are common to this area.

00:19:10.720 --> 00:19:14.540
So this is the dish
that everyone gets right

00:19:14.540 --> 00:19:15.606
when they sit down.

00:19:15.606 --> 00:19:16.730
We call it California Bowl.

00:19:16.730 --> 00:19:18.010
It's kind of a joke.

00:19:18.010 --> 00:19:20.290
It's brown rice,
sprouts, and avocado.

00:19:20.290 --> 00:19:23.390
So we took typical
hippie Californian food

00:19:23.390 --> 00:19:24.940
and transformed it a little bit.

00:19:24.940 --> 00:19:27.350
I think one thing that's
really important about dining

00:19:27.350 --> 00:19:29.910
experiences like this--
and it's so funny.

00:19:29.910 --> 00:19:33.920
I keep getting asked about
the tyranny of tasting menus,

00:19:33.920 --> 00:19:37.230
as if people are being
shackled, dragged

00:19:37.230 --> 00:19:40.630
into these terrible
places, these dungeons,

00:19:40.630 --> 00:19:44.430
and being left to
languish there for hours.

00:19:44.430 --> 00:19:45.560
And I think it's true.

00:19:45.560 --> 00:19:47.910
A bad tasting menu is
like a prison sentence.

00:19:47.910 --> 00:19:49.680
No one wants that.

00:19:49.680 --> 00:19:51.180
The one thing we
work really hard on

00:19:51.180 --> 00:19:55.680
is making it fun, kind of like
when you're writing a book.

00:19:55.680 --> 00:20:00.485
The way I put it is it
would be like saying,

00:20:00.485 --> 00:20:03.110
if there's plenty of good short
stories in the world, why would

00:20:03.110 --> 00:20:04.160
you need a novel?

00:20:04.160 --> 00:20:06.540
Well, the form allows
expression that's

00:20:06.540 --> 00:20:09.620
entirely different,
more complex.

00:20:09.620 --> 00:20:12.860
And the constituent
components don't

00:20:12.860 --> 00:20:16.830
have to carry as
much responsibility.

00:20:16.830 --> 00:20:20.907
In the case of a
restaurant meal,

00:20:20.907 --> 00:20:22.990
you need to leave with
enough food in your stomach

00:20:22.990 --> 00:20:24.790
or you're not going to be happy.

00:20:24.790 --> 00:20:28.020
So if you want to
serve smaller portions,

00:20:28.020 --> 00:20:29.780
very intense flavors,
maybe something that

00:20:29.780 --> 00:20:32.840
doesn't taste good when
you get to the end of it.

00:20:32.840 --> 00:20:34.520
Maybe it's super
temperature sensitive

00:20:34.520 --> 00:20:36.240
and you can't have
more than three bites

00:20:36.240 --> 00:20:38.050
without it disappearing.

00:20:38.050 --> 00:20:39.850
You have to do that
within a longer menu.

00:20:39.850 --> 00:20:42.997
That being said, our menu
is 2, 2 and 1/2 hours.

00:20:42.997 --> 00:20:44.580
We try and keep
people moving through.

00:20:44.580 --> 00:20:45.663
We're an urban restaurant.

00:20:45.663 --> 00:20:48.090
We're not a country restaurant.

00:20:48.090 --> 00:20:49.310
People got places to go.

00:20:49.310 --> 00:20:50.811
And so we're very
cognizant of that.

00:20:50.811 --> 00:20:52.768
But when they come in,
the most important thing

00:20:52.768 --> 00:20:54.560
is we wan them to
feel comfortable.

00:20:54.560 --> 00:20:58.140
I mean, this references
chips and dip.

00:20:58.140 --> 00:21:01.615
It basically it's a welcome.

00:21:01.615 --> 00:21:02.490
It's not a challenge.

00:21:02.490 --> 00:21:06.570
We want people to settle in,
have a glass of champagne,

00:21:06.570 --> 00:21:09.992
have a few bites to
eat, a and chill out

00:21:09.992 --> 00:21:11.450
while they're
getting ready to eat.

00:21:11.450 --> 00:21:16.820
So the rice is overcooked,
pureed, spread very thin,

00:21:16.820 --> 00:21:18.760
dehydrated, and fried in oil.

00:21:18.760 --> 00:21:22.380
And oil so hot that literally
it goes in for a second

00:21:22.380 --> 00:21:25.760
and you're pulling it out of
the oil and it's blistering.

00:21:25.760 --> 00:21:28.720
And the oil that's clinging
to it is still cooking it.

00:21:28.720 --> 00:21:32.820
And so it's super, super
light, like a chicharon.

00:21:32.820 --> 00:21:35.990
Avocado that's charred and
mixed with a little lime juice.

00:21:35.990 --> 00:21:37.510
And then sprouts.

00:21:37.510 --> 00:21:38.836
So the sprouts we grow ourself.

00:21:38.836 --> 00:21:40.210
And it's to have
something fresh.

00:21:40.210 --> 00:21:41.820
It's to have something alive.

00:21:41.820 --> 00:21:46.120
and also capturing
that moment of energy

00:21:46.120 --> 00:21:51.640
when a plant is just
starting to grow.

00:21:51.640 --> 00:21:56.180
One of the things
that I think is

00:21:56.180 --> 00:21:57.650
really essential
to how we cook is

00:21:57.650 --> 00:22:01.200
to take-- I guess one thing
you can do if you want to have

00:22:01.200 --> 00:22:03.735
the shock of the new-- because
if you talk about creativity,

00:22:03.735 --> 00:22:06.780
if you talk about an expectation
of a sense of discovery,

00:22:06.780 --> 00:22:11.540
one thing is to find something
that no one's ever seen before

00:22:11.540 --> 00:22:12.570
and present it.

00:22:12.570 --> 00:22:13.530
Well, of course,
then you're going

00:22:13.530 --> 00:22:14.696
to get the shock of the new.

00:22:14.696 --> 00:22:18.060
But it's not going to have
any of the emotional content

00:22:18.060 --> 00:22:20.570
because there's no sense of
familiarity along with it.

00:22:20.570 --> 00:22:23.600
So it just kind of
comes across your radar.

00:22:23.600 --> 00:22:24.630
And then it's gone.

00:22:24.630 --> 00:22:27.550
It doesn't have
any staying power.

00:22:27.550 --> 00:22:30.240
But to take something
that's very, very familiar,

00:22:30.240 --> 00:22:32.640
and to make it look
new again, I think,

00:22:32.640 --> 00:22:35.480
then you get all of the
emotional connection

00:22:35.480 --> 00:22:39.640
of the familiarity and the
newness at the same time.

00:22:39.640 --> 00:22:41.550
So we work a lot with
humble ingredients,

00:22:41.550 --> 00:22:43.530
things that are
very, very ordinary.

00:22:43.530 --> 00:22:45.300
And we work really
hard to make them new.

00:22:45.300 --> 00:22:51.532
So this came from my partner
in the business, Ron Boyd.

00:22:51.532 --> 00:22:52.740
We were talking about a dish.

00:22:52.740 --> 00:22:54.490
And he said, what
about beet and rose?

00:22:54.490 --> 00:22:56.610
And he was thinking
about the flavors.

00:22:56.610 --> 00:22:58.130
For some reason, I just
started thinking about what

00:22:58.130 --> 00:22:59.640
if I made the beet
look like a rose?

00:22:59.640 --> 00:23:04.570
This is the most difficult dish
to produce we've ever done.

00:23:04.570 --> 00:23:05.810
There's no molds.

00:23:05.810 --> 00:23:07.030
It's all done by hand.

00:23:07.030 --> 00:23:11.500
It is so tedious, so labor
intensive-- roasting,

00:23:11.500 --> 00:23:16.190
slicing, compressing,
putting it together.

00:23:16.190 --> 00:23:19.450
Underneath it, a
little bit of yogurt.

00:23:19.450 --> 00:23:22.790
And then the ice on the
side is rose petals.

00:23:22.790 --> 00:23:24.710
So if you imagine
like a rose petal tea

00:23:24.710 --> 00:23:27.780
with a little bit
of honey and lemon.

00:23:27.780 --> 00:23:31.582
So bright, fresh, like
a soda on a hot day.

00:23:31.582 --> 00:23:33.540
Like you take a bite and
you keep wanting more.

00:23:33.540 --> 00:23:34.540
It kind of draws you in.

00:23:34.540 --> 00:23:36.580
So it's a first course.

00:23:36.580 --> 00:23:38.590
It's meant to reset
people's expectations,

00:23:38.590 --> 00:23:40.180
like a sense a surprise.

00:23:40.180 --> 00:23:45.540
A lot of the ideas that would
come in the rest of meal.

00:23:45.540 --> 00:23:46.840
We cook with a lot of acidity.

00:23:46.840 --> 00:23:48.215
We cook with a
lot of brightness.

00:23:48.215 --> 00:23:50.070
For me, one of the
things we talk about

00:23:50.070 --> 00:23:51.250
is energy a lot in the book.

00:23:51.250 --> 00:23:54.339
And the idea of energy to
me is partly in the products

00:23:54.339 --> 00:23:56.130
you work with and partly
it's how you cook.

00:23:56.130 --> 00:23:58.540
And so acidity
makes things jump.

00:23:58.540 --> 00:24:02.730
It makes things
alive a little bit.

00:24:02.730 --> 00:24:08.790
So this is a dish
that, in a way,

00:24:08.790 --> 00:24:11.370
it's not just about elevating,
but within the kitchen

00:24:11.370 --> 00:24:14.173
it's about how hard it
is, and how much you

00:24:14.173 --> 00:24:17.110
have to respect the effort
of making a simple form.

00:24:22.070 --> 00:24:25.960
So I wrote a book in
2003, came out in 2004,

00:24:25.960 --> 00:24:28.520
with a natural perfumer
named Mandy Aftel.

00:24:28.520 --> 00:24:30.610
I met her in 2001
through a mutual friend.

00:24:33.620 --> 00:24:36.400
This is a woman
who has basically

00:24:36.400 --> 00:24:39.850
taken an art form that's
thousands of years old, that's

00:24:39.850 --> 00:24:42.730
disappeared for 100 years,
and has almost single-handedly

00:24:42.730 --> 00:24:46.020
brought it back, which
is making perfume

00:24:46.020 --> 00:24:47.980
out of natural essences.

00:24:47.980 --> 00:24:50.300
Because nothing you
find in a supermarket

00:24:50.300 --> 00:24:52.980
is made from anything natural.

00:24:52.980 --> 00:24:56.780
They started figuring out how to
synthesize the top two or three

00:24:56.780 --> 00:24:58.270
notes out of hundreds.

00:24:58.270 --> 00:25:04.460
So what makes food so complex
is its incredible organic

00:25:04.460 --> 00:25:08.610
chemistry that you can
actually mimic pretty easily,

00:25:08.610 --> 00:25:10.930
but you don't get
any of the richness.

00:25:10.930 --> 00:25:12.170
It doesn't change.

00:25:12.170 --> 00:25:13.270
It's very static.

00:25:13.270 --> 00:25:18.050
And so when we met, she showed
me about essential oils,

00:25:18.050 --> 00:25:20.750
which I'd never worked
with before, but even

00:25:20.750 --> 00:25:23.430
more about the
relationship between what

00:25:23.430 --> 00:25:27.660
we eat smell, taste, and
remember, and how what we smell

00:25:27.660 --> 00:25:29.840
is most of what we taste.

00:25:29.840 --> 00:25:35.260
And this dish is cucumber and
melon, so biological cousins.

00:25:35.260 --> 00:25:36.310
There's two forms.

00:25:36.310 --> 00:25:38.960
One is a drink.

00:25:38.960 --> 00:25:43.000
It's melon juice, cucumber
juice, and a little bit a lime.

00:25:43.000 --> 00:25:46.920
And then a little salad
of compressed melon,

00:25:46.920 --> 00:25:48.760
cucumber, and little
borage leaves,

00:25:48.760 --> 00:25:50.710
which have a cucumber-y flavor.

00:25:50.710 --> 00:25:52.260
So this dish, you
see that there's

00:25:52.260 --> 00:25:53.718
that little thing
that says "mint."

00:25:53.718 --> 00:25:55.600
That's a spray that Mandy made.

00:25:55.600 --> 00:26:00.310
We've collaborated together on
a lot of things over the years.

00:26:00.310 --> 00:26:02.600
But this was, basically,
we had a plate.

00:26:02.600 --> 00:26:03.830
We sprayed it with this mint.

00:26:03.830 --> 00:26:05.890
And we put two
things on top of it.

00:26:05.890 --> 00:26:06.560
So you get it.

00:26:06.560 --> 00:26:08.766
There's no mint in the dish.

00:26:08.766 --> 00:26:09.390
You smell mint.

00:26:09.390 --> 00:26:11.931
So the first thing that happens
is you have the smell of mint

00:26:11.931 --> 00:26:14.260
and the taste of
cucumber and melon.

00:26:14.260 --> 00:26:18.760
By the end, your taste buds
have been totally fooled.

00:26:18.760 --> 00:26:20.590
So you're tasting
mint in the food

00:26:20.590 --> 00:26:22.840
even though there's
no mint in the food.

00:26:22.840 --> 00:26:25.500
And so it's really fun.

00:26:25.500 --> 00:26:31.120
And it's also kind of a
sensory trompe l'oeil.

00:26:34.190 --> 00:26:38.110
So this dish I made as
a joke for a friend.

00:26:38.110 --> 00:26:42.870
Massimo Bottura is an Italian
chef, a very great time

00:26:42.870 --> 00:26:45.000
Italian chef, has a
restaurant in Modena.

00:26:45.000 --> 00:26:47.785
And he took one of
the famous dishes

00:26:47.785 --> 00:26:51.530
of Emilia Romagna, his
region, Bollito Misto.

00:26:51.530 --> 00:26:54.760
And he made a dish called
Bollito Misto, No Bollito--

00:26:54.760 --> 00:26:57.030
so Boiled Meat, Not Boiled.

00:26:57.030 --> 00:27:02.975
And so at first, his
region was just appalled.

00:27:02.975 --> 00:27:04.600
It's a very traditional region.

00:27:04.600 --> 00:27:07.850
And to take something that's
a traditional touchstone

00:27:07.850 --> 00:27:09.500
and reinvent it?

00:27:09.500 --> 00:27:12.300
Oh, that was just--
no one liked that.

00:27:12.300 --> 00:27:14.400
Well, over time,
it caught on and it

00:27:14.400 --> 00:27:16.655
became one of his
most famous dishes.

00:27:16.655 --> 00:27:18.280
And then I was talking
to him one time.

00:27:18.280 --> 00:27:22.080
And he was laughing that
it had become so copied,

00:27:22.080 --> 00:27:25.015
people were even making
Frito Misto, No Frito.

00:27:25.015 --> 00:27:26.640
And so he came to
eat at my restaurant.

00:27:26.640 --> 00:27:28.770
I made Fried Egg, Not Fried.

00:27:28.770 --> 00:27:34.720
And so it's an egg yolk
poached in smoked oil.

00:27:34.720 --> 00:27:36.760
And then around
it is bread crumbs

00:27:36.760 --> 00:27:39.140
that have a little bit of smoke.

00:27:39.140 --> 00:27:43.694
Different kinds of brassica,
so cauliflower and broccoli,

00:27:43.694 --> 00:27:44.360
stuff like that.

00:27:44.360 --> 00:27:48.990
And then the sauce is this
very intensely acidic,

00:27:48.990 --> 00:27:52.970
because the egg is
very rich, emulsion

00:27:52.970 --> 00:27:56.160
based on steamed egg white.

00:27:56.160 --> 00:27:58.510
And so he came in.

00:27:58.510 --> 00:27:59.480
And I did it for him.

00:27:59.480 --> 00:28:00.260
And he loved it.

00:28:00.260 --> 00:28:05.150
But even more, I loved the
dish that came out of it.

00:28:05.150 --> 00:28:09.500
Then over time, what
the dish evolved into

00:28:09.500 --> 00:28:12.600
is actually a dish that we serve
now at the restaurant, which

00:28:12.600 --> 00:28:15.284
is that same yolk, no
breadcrumbs, and a little bit

00:28:15.284 --> 00:28:16.950
of caviar, a little
bit of whipped creme

00:28:16.950 --> 00:28:20.220
fraiche, and chives--
so, so simple.

00:28:20.220 --> 00:28:26.000
One of things we discovered,
I think, in earlier times,

00:28:26.000 --> 00:28:28.380
I really wanted to
challenge people more.

00:28:28.380 --> 00:28:31.361
And now I changed my mind
about that a little bit.

00:28:31.361 --> 00:28:32.860
I think at the
beginning of the meal

00:28:32.860 --> 00:28:34.610
is a good time to
be very comforting.

00:28:34.610 --> 00:28:39.160
So we're a two Michelin
star restaurant.

00:28:39.160 --> 00:28:42.460
I never set out to make a
two Michelin star restaurant.

00:28:42.460 --> 00:28:43.730
But that's what we are.

00:28:43.730 --> 00:28:45.660
And so more and more, I
feel like, well, shit,

00:28:45.660 --> 00:28:47.430
if that's what we
are, I think we

00:28:47.430 --> 00:28:50.320
need to provide
a little bit more

00:28:50.320 --> 00:28:54.670
of the kinds of things, a few
moments that people expect,

00:28:54.670 --> 00:28:59.770
of luxury, of a
nod to tradition.

00:28:59.770 --> 00:29:04.990
And so caviar, this egg yolk
that's cooked in smoked oil

00:29:04.990 --> 00:29:08.790
to almost a custard consistency,
creme fraiche, and chive--

00:29:08.790 --> 00:29:12.180
right down the middle of
the road, perfectly done.

00:29:12.180 --> 00:29:14.890
Everyone loves it.

00:29:14.890 --> 00:29:17.400
And a lot of people
at the end of the day,

00:29:17.400 --> 00:29:20.750
they'll go, everything was so
great, especially that egg.

00:29:20.750 --> 00:29:23.957
Well, maybe five years ago,
I would've looked at them

00:29:23.957 --> 00:29:26.540
and like, oh, no, but I did so
much else that was so much more

00:29:26.540 --> 00:29:27.040
interesting.

00:29:27.040 --> 00:29:29.120
I can't believe you
loved the crowd-pleaser.

00:29:29.120 --> 00:29:31.892
And now I just like, great.

00:29:31.892 --> 00:29:33.350
Because that's what
it's there for.

00:29:33.350 --> 00:29:34.599
It's there for people to love.

00:29:34.599 --> 00:29:38.170
So this is how even
when we're-- for us,

00:29:38.170 --> 00:29:41.920
food is part of like
a continual evolution.

00:29:41.920 --> 00:29:46.550
And so what started out as
something totally different

00:29:46.550 --> 00:29:48.962
has turned into something,
like the main part of it

00:29:48.962 --> 00:29:50.670
turned into something
we serve every day.

00:29:55.070 --> 00:29:56.820
I'm not going to talk
too much about this.

00:29:56.820 --> 00:30:00.090
This is a morel dish.

00:30:00.090 --> 00:30:04.100
I was at Full Belly
Stand in Marin.

00:30:04.100 --> 00:30:07.170
And they had new potatoes
that had just come in.

00:30:07.170 --> 00:30:09.080
Next to the new potatoes
they had popcorn.

00:30:09.080 --> 00:30:11.080
They just happened to be
having it side by side.

00:30:11.080 --> 00:30:14.700
And then I thought,
mushroom, potato, corn.

00:30:14.700 --> 00:30:15.200
Makes sense.

00:30:15.200 --> 00:30:15.390
Why not?

00:30:15.390 --> 00:30:16.840
I've never cooked
with popcorn before.

00:30:16.840 --> 00:30:17.420
I came back.

00:30:17.420 --> 00:30:18.140
I made this dish.

00:30:18.140 --> 00:30:21.430
A little popcorn, sauce,
and some basil sprouts.

00:30:21.430 --> 00:30:23.020
So it was a very nice dish.

00:30:23.020 --> 00:30:28.240
But what was interesting
about it was the dish

00:30:28.240 --> 00:30:34.480
demanded a very elegant
popcorn sauce, very smooth.

00:30:34.480 --> 00:30:36.930
But right before blended
it, I kept looking at it.

00:30:36.930 --> 00:30:38.920
And the process is very simple.

00:30:38.920 --> 00:30:41.360
It's popcorn, water, butter.

00:30:41.360 --> 00:30:43.100
Bring it up to a
about 30 seconds.

00:30:43.100 --> 00:30:44.180
Strain it.

00:30:44.180 --> 00:30:45.310
That liquid?

00:30:45.310 --> 00:30:49.971
So if you took butter and
water, heat it, cool it

00:30:49.971 --> 00:30:52.470
in the refrigerator, and then
remove the butter so it's just

00:30:52.470 --> 00:30:55.540
water, that water is going
to taste like butter.

00:30:55.540 --> 00:31:01.500
So the flavor of fat
is water-soluble.

00:31:01.500 --> 00:31:02.380
So we do that a lot.

00:31:02.380 --> 00:31:03.470
We cook things with fat.

00:31:03.470 --> 00:31:04.840
We take the fat out.

00:31:04.840 --> 00:31:07.580
The liquid carries the flavor.

00:31:07.580 --> 00:31:10.870
And so in this case, we
kept using that liquid

00:31:10.870 --> 00:31:13.210
to cook more and more popcorn.

00:31:13.210 --> 00:31:16.780
And the popcorn that was
saturated, we passed it.

00:31:16.780 --> 00:31:20.600
And this is a dish,
I mean, to a dish

00:31:20.600 --> 00:31:22.650
is a little bit of a stretch.

00:31:22.650 --> 00:31:26.970
It's a fun little thing that we
throw into the menu sometimes.

00:31:26.970 --> 00:31:31.579
A basket strainer, and a
pot, and a spoon-- that's

00:31:31.579 --> 00:31:32.620
what we use to make this.

00:31:32.620 --> 00:31:34.200
So it's very low tech.

00:31:34.200 --> 00:31:35.830
We pass through a
basket strainer.

00:31:35.830 --> 00:31:39.380
What comes out of the other
side is exactly like grits.

00:31:39.380 --> 00:31:44.960
So basically, this is grits
made from popped popcorn.

00:31:44.960 --> 00:31:47.840
One of the things that
I think about a lot

00:31:47.840 --> 00:31:50.920
is what it means to
be an American cook.

00:31:50.920 --> 00:31:53.480
I think our traditions
are very new.

00:31:53.480 --> 00:31:54.746
Our country's very new.

00:31:54.746 --> 00:31:56.370
And we're mostly made
up of immigrants.

00:31:56.370 --> 00:32:00.730
My family is a
family of immigrants.

00:32:00.730 --> 00:32:03.590
Three generations ago, none of
my family was in this country.

00:32:03.590 --> 00:32:07.380
And I think that's true
of most of this country.

00:32:07.380 --> 00:32:09.380
And so what does it mean
to be an American cook?

00:32:09.380 --> 00:32:11.840
And what does it mean to
work within traditions

00:32:11.840 --> 00:32:12.970
that aren't our traditions?

00:32:12.970 --> 00:32:15.290
And how do we make
them our traditions?

00:32:15.290 --> 00:32:19.034
So very early on,
there was starting

00:32:19.034 --> 00:32:22.470
to be a regional identity.

00:32:22.470 --> 00:32:25.310
The South, I think,
is much more developed

00:32:25.310 --> 00:32:27.420
than most other
parts of the country.

00:32:27.420 --> 00:32:31.180
And grits is one of our
most iconic regional dishes.

00:32:31.180 --> 00:32:33.100
Popcorn, I mean
everyone knows popcorn.

00:32:33.100 --> 00:32:34.470
Everyone goes to the movies.

00:32:34.470 --> 00:32:40.130
It's one of our most well-known
pop culture sensory memories.

00:32:40.130 --> 00:32:43.640
So combining the two-- grits
made from popped popcorn--

00:32:43.640 --> 00:32:45.770
you take two things that
are incredibly familiar

00:32:45.770 --> 00:32:47.240
and make something new.

00:32:47.240 --> 00:32:50.540
So I think maybe
that's kind of-- I

00:32:50.540 --> 00:32:55.270
don't know-- something
about American food in that.

00:32:55.270 --> 00:32:58.244
The other part of our
culture-- and our culture

00:32:58.244 --> 00:32:59.660
here in San
Francisco-- and I talk

00:32:59.660 --> 00:33:03.230
a lot about San Francisco
and California's history,

00:33:03.230 --> 00:33:05.670
and our history, and
here-- is that we

00:33:05.670 --> 00:33:09.710
have an incredible swirl of
people from all over the world

00:33:09.710 --> 00:33:10.890
here.

00:33:10.890 --> 00:33:15.190
Part of being a very new city
is that, I mean, the people who

00:33:15.190 --> 00:33:19.400
grow our food, they're from
Japan, China, South America,

00:33:19.400 --> 00:33:20.909
France, Italy.

00:33:20.909 --> 00:33:22.200
And they come with their seeds.

00:33:22.200 --> 00:33:24.560
They come with their
backgrounds their ideas.

00:33:24.560 --> 00:33:29.060
And so, we have the flavors
of the world here, grown here.

00:33:29.060 --> 00:33:32.440
And so we study a
lot about-- sometimes

00:33:32.440 --> 00:33:36.000
I see a product that I
don't know, I'll ask.

00:33:36.000 --> 00:33:39.030
In Italy, how do you make that?

00:33:39.030 --> 00:33:41.510
What do you do
with this in Japan?

00:33:41.510 --> 00:33:45.200
And we learn a lot about
new ways to look at food.

00:33:45.200 --> 00:33:48.810
I think an ingredient,
a lot of people

00:33:48.810 --> 00:33:50.900
think it's like a
piece of paper, right?

00:33:50.900 --> 00:33:51.985
You got two sides.

00:33:51.985 --> 00:33:53.360
I think that it's
like a diamond.

00:33:53.360 --> 00:33:55.150
It's like so many facets.

00:33:55.150 --> 00:33:56.960
And we're constantly
turning things over

00:33:56.960 --> 00:33:57.832
to find a new facet.

00:33:57.832 --> 00:33:58.665
It's the same thing.

00:33:58.665 --> 00:34:02.320
It's just you're looking
at it in a different way.

00:34:02.320 --> 00:34:06.310
And so this dish
came out of a series

00:34:06.310 --> 00:34:09.042
of dishes called Earth and Sea.

00:34:09.042 --> 00:34:10.500
I went through a
period where I was

00:34:10.500 --> 00:34:11.840
naming things more poetically.

00:34:11.840 --> 00:34:12.929
I stopped.

00:34:12.929 --> 00:34:15.809
I got really bored with that.

00:34:15.809 --> 00:34:17.600
But this stuck with me
because when I first

00:34:17.600 --> 00:34:19.849
moved to San Francisco, I
was at the edge of the city.

00:34:19.849 --> 00:34:23.620
I mean, I grew up on the
ocean in a little town called

00:34:23.620 --> 00:34:26.709
Manchester in the North
Shore of Massachusetts.

00:34:26.709 --> 00:34:28.250
And it's right next
to a fishing town

00:34:28.250 --> 00:34:30.710
called Gloucester,
which is made famous

00:34:30.710 --> 00:34:33.582
by Sebastian Yunger's
"Perfect Storm."

00:34:33.582 --> 00:34:35.790
And then I think they made
a movie, which is probably

00:34:35.790 --> 00:34:39.330
more famous than the book.

00:34:39.330 --> 00:34:44.380
And the ocean, the smell of the
ocean, and of seaweed drying

00:34:44.380 --> 00:34:47.040
on the rocks, of
the feeling of what

00:34:47.040 --> 00:34:50.690
it's like to be on the coast
is so deeply ingrained in me

00:34:50.690 --> 00:34:52.630
that I don't think I
could ever live too far

00:34:52.630 --> 00:34:53.870
away from the ocean.

00:34:53.870 --> 00:34:57.240
And so where I lived was right
on the edge of San Francisco,

00:34:57.240 --> 00:35:00.830
right where this
incredibly dramatic moment

00:35:00.830 --> 00:35:02.281
where the water comes in.

00:35:02.281 --> 00:35:03.530
There's a little bit of beach.

00:35:03.530 --> 00:35:04.655
And then the forest starts.

00:35:07.270 --> 00:35:10.460
We have a lot of dishes that
try and capture this moment,

00:35:10.460 --> 00:35:13.870
this energy that happens right
where the two things meet.

00:35:13.870 --> 00:35:19.040
And so the little circles are
tofu coagulated with seawater.

00:35:19.040 --> 00:35:20.880
So this is something
that our pastry

00:35:20.880 --> 00:35:23.820
chef Matt Tinder brought
into the kitchen.

00:35:23.820 --> 00:35:24.830
It's very traditional.

00:35:24.830 --> 00:35:28.880
It's done all through
coastal areas in Asia.

00:35:28.880 --> 00:35:31.760
They'll use actual seawater
to coagulate instead

00:35:31.760 --> 00:35:38.860
of the boiled down
chemicals or minerals.

00:35:38.860 --> 00:35:42.020
And this is like fresh ricotta.

00:35:42.020 --> 00:35:44.870
It's not pressed.

00:35:44.870 --> 00:35:46.770
We make it ourselves.

00:35:46.770 --> 00:35:51.637
And it's really, really a
delicate, incredible product.

00:35:51.637 --> 00:35:53.720
When we make it, it separates
into curds and whey.

00:35:53.720 --> 00:35:55.830
We take the whey, mix
it with tomato water,

00:35:55.830 --> 00:35:59.700
so kind of like a sweet clear
elixir of tomato, chopped sea

00:35:59.700 --> 00:36:02.650
weed or sea lettuce,
I should say,

00:36:02.650 --> 00:36:04.900
and then a bunch of different
kinds of fresh seaweeds.

00:36:04.900 --> 00:36:07.970
Fresh seaweed is something
I had this fixation about.

00:36:07.970 --> 00:36:09.220
I couldn't find any for years.

00:36:09.220 --> 00:36:12.740
And finally we were working with
a company down in Monterey Bay

00:36:12.740 --> 00:36:15.730
called the Monterey
Bay Abalone Company.

00:36:15.730 --> 00:36:18.421
I was talking to them in 2007.

00:36:18.421 --> 00:36:20.670
And they were talking about
all of the different kinds

00:36:20.670 --> 00:36:23.010
of seaweed they were
feeding to the abalone.

00:36:23.010 --> 00:36:24.320
And I was like, wait a minute.

00:36:24.320 --> 00:36:25.695
You have fresh seaweed.

00:36:25.695 --> 00:36:26.570
I want fresh seaweed.

00:36:26.570 --> 00:36:29.860
It was like, can you send me
the seaweed with the abalone?

00:36:29.860 --> 00:36:30.527
They said, sure.

00:36:30.527 --> 00:36:32.443
And so that's when we
started working with it.

00:36:32.443 --> 00:36:34.660
And it took a long
time to figure out how

00:36:34.660 --> 00:36:37.630
to-- A lot of them
are carrageenanphytes.

00:36:37.630 --> 00:36:39.500
So when you go to
a place and they've

00:36:39.500 --> 00:36:42.750
used carrageenan or
something to thicken,

00:36:42.750 --> 00:36:44.000
those come from seaweed.

00:36:44.000 --> 00:36:46.166
So if you don't treat the
seaweeds in a certain way,

00:36:46.166 --> 00:36:49.890
they will just ooze a
snail trail or something.

00:36:49.890 --> 00:36:52.730
It's really gross.

00:36:52.730 --> 00:36:57.700
And so fresh seaweeds and then
a little bit of olive oil,

00:36:57.700 --> 00:36:59.370
pungent but not overwhelming.

00:36:59.370 --> 00:37:03.240
And so it was really funny about
this-- and then a little bit

00:37:03.240 --> 00:37:06.820
of cherry tomato-- so
I took this to a table.

00:37:06.820 --> 00:37:08.470
It had been on the
menu about a month.

00:37:08.470 --> 00:37:10.560
A table [INAUDIBLE],
I put it down.

00:37:10.560 --> 00:37:11.870
I do one in the dining room.

00:37:11.870 --> 00:37:13.110
And I never used to.

00:37:13.110 --> 00:37:15.950
But now I find that I
really like to see people.

00:37:15.950 --> 00:37:18.410
They may or may not want
to actually talk to me.

00:37:18.410 --> 00:37:20.630
But I think if they
do, or it's just

00:37:20.630 --> 00:37:23.530
nice to know that someone's
cooking your food, I guess.

00:37:23.530 --> 00:37:25.730
And so I put it down.

00:37:25.730 --> 00:37:26.660
And they look at me.

00:37:26.660 --> 00:37:27.993
And they're like, this is great.

00:37:27.993 --> 00:37:29.485
We've been eating this all week.

00:37:29.485 --> 00:37:32.890
And I was like, thinking
to myself, whoa,

00:37:32.890 --> 00:37:34.960
they've been eating
tofu coagulated

00:37:34.960 --> 00:37:38.050
with seawater, seaweed,
and tomato all week?

00:37:38.050 --> 00:37:39.790
This is like crazy.

00:37:39.790 --> 00:37:41.360
I looked at them like, really?

00:37:41.360 --> 00:37:44.559
They're like, yeah, tomato,
mozzarella, olive oil.

00:37:44.559 --> 00:37:46.350
Because that's kind of
what it looked like.

00:37:46.350 --> 00:37:50.110
And so a lot of
our food has this--

00:37:50.110 --> 00:37:51.810
like the little nesting dolls.

00:37:51.810 --> 00:37:54.080
It's like an idea inside
an idea inside an idea.

00:37:54.080 --> 00:37:58.140
So the connectivity is
what draws people in.

00:37:58.140 --> 00:37:59.702
A lot of different
kinds of people

00:37:59.702 --> 00:38:01.660
can recognize different
things within the food.

00:38:01.660 --> 00:38:03.160
And I think that's
really important.

00:38:03.160 --> 00:38:07.630
So this to me is like a
dish that's like California,

00:38:07.630 --> 00:38:13.190
like San Francisco, like
a part of our culture.

00:38:13.190 --> 00:38:17.600
This is another thing
that we-- I love tarts.

00:38:17.600 --> 00:38:19.685
And I was making very
traditional tarts

00:38:19.685 --> 00:38:20.310
for many years.

00:38:20.310 --> 00:38:23.970
And then one day I wanted
to do something different.

00:38:23.970 --> 00:38:26.400
So I flipped it
over-- crust on top,

00:38:26.400 --> 00:38:28.920
filling in the middle,
the top on the bottom.

00:38:28.920 --> 00:38:32.120
And actually the way it eats,
everything about it was great.

00:38:32.120 --> 00:38:34.434
So I went through
a few iterations.

00:38:34.434 --> 00:38:35.850
There's three of
them in the book.

00:38:35.850 --> 00:38:37.110
This was the last one.

00:38:37.110 --> 00:38:40.370
And it's the weirdest one
and definitely my favorite.

00:38:40.370 --> 00:38:44.770
So the top crust is buckwheat,
sheep's milk fromage blanc

00:38:44.770 --> 00:38:45.540
underneath.

00:38:45.540 --> 00:38:50.590
And then Ron cooked fennel,
a little burnt fennel oil.

00:38:50.590 --> 00:38:53.870
There's wild fennel
pollen, so a lot

00:38:53.870 --> 00:38:55.560
of anise flavors in the chervil.

00:38:55.560 --> 00:38:58.860
The sauce around
it, wheat grass.

00:38:58.860 --> 00:39:02.630
So again, trying to
work with iconic things,

00:39:02.630 --> 00:39:08.520
but wrap it into a
sensibility that's delicious.

00:39:08.520 --> 00:39:11.530
Because at the end of the
day, if it's not delicious,

00:39:11.530 --> 00:39:12.910
it may or may not
be a good idea,

00:39:12.910 --> 00:39:14.500
but it's definitely
not worth serving.

00:39:18.140 --> 00:39:21.050
I put these pictures in here
just to show you a little bit,

00:39:21.050 --> 00:39:22.810
because they're in
the book, about how

00:39:22.810 --> 00:39:23.940
we put a dish together.

00:39:23.940 --> 00:39:25.856
I'm not going to go
through the dish too much.

00:39:25.856 --> 00:39:28.290
It's salsify, black
trumpet mushrooms,

00:39:28.290 --> 00:39:32.130
and wood sorrel with
lichen vinaigrette.

00:39:32.130 --> 00:39:36.780
So it's a dish of the forest
in winter a little bit.

00:39:36.780 --> 00:39:40.290
So you can see a little
bit about how much detail

00:39:40.290 --> 00:39:42.830
goes into putting
these dishes together.

00:39:42.830 --> 00:39:44.010
And so what you get is this.

00:39:44.010 --> 00:39:46.770
And it looks very,
very simple in a way.

00:39:46.770 --> 00:39:49.960
Well, we don't scatter those
things all over the plate.

00:39:49.960 --> 00:39:51.020
This is on a light table.

00:39:51.020 --> 00:39:53.860
But really, when you get
it at the restaurant,

00:39:53.860 --> 00:39:57.460
you would get this
and the vinaigrette.

00:39:57.460 --> 00:39:59.240
And it looks so simple.

00:39:59.240 --> 00:40:00.960
It's easy to eat.

00:40:00.960 --> 00:40:03.060
It tastes good.

00:40:03.060 --> 00:40:06.840
But what goes into it is all
of these layerings of things.

00:40:06.840 --> 00:40:09.182
But the lichen
vinaigrette-- so lichen's

00:40:09.182 --> 00:40:13.030
a fungus that grows on trees.

00:40:13.030 --> 00:40:15.950
It's like mushrooms, basically.

00:40:15.950 --> 00:40:19.300
And it's not something we
really worked with before.

00:40:19.300 --> 00:40:24.660
But just by accident, I
found myself in a forest.

00:40:24.660 --> 00:40:26.820
And I found a piece that
would look beautiful.

00:40:26.820 --> 00:40:27.970
I ate it.

00:40:27.970 --> 00:40:31.130
And the nice thing about
cooks-- we' we're very curious.

00:40:31.130 --> 00:40:32.880
I mean, I'm amazed
that I'm still alive.

00:40:32.880 --> 00:40:34.420
I eat anything.

00:40:34.420 --> 00:40:39.725
If it moves, it doesn't
move, I'll try it.

00:40:39.725 --> 00:40:41.619
I start chewing on it.

00:40:41.619 --> 00:40:43.160
It didn't really
taste like anything.

00:40:43.160 --> 00:40:48.210
And all of a sudden, this really
deep, mushroomy, earthy, really

00:40:48.210 --> 00:40:49.410
delicious flavor came.

00:40:49.410 --> 00:40:51.700
And I'm like, huh, this could
be a cooking ingredient.

00:40:54.480 --> 00:40:56.630
And then so I took it back.

00:40:56.630 --> 00:40:59.350
I learned that you
need to boil lichen.

00:40:59.350 --> 00:41:03.190
And by the way, this is a
kind of called Parmotrema.

00:41:03.190 --> 00:41:07.110
Most of the hundreds of
kinds of lichens are edible.

00:41:07.110 --> 00:41:07.860
A few aren't.

00:41:07.860 --> 00:41:09.985
It's not like something
you should go and really do

00:41:09.985 --> 00:41:13.630
like I did because you
just don't want to.

00:41:13.630 --> 00:41:19.450
But we boiled it, dehydrated
it, and ground it into a powder.

00:41:19.450 --> 00:41:22.230
And what was amazing was when we
boiled it, at a certain point,

00:41:22.230 --> 00:41:26.030
the bitterness boiled
away and you're

00:41:26.030 --> 00:41:28.040
left with something earthly.

00:41:28.040 --> 00:41:29.960
It tasted like black
trumpet mushrooms

00:41:29.960 --> 00:41:31.730
and kind of like truffles.

00:41:31.730 --> 00:41:33.080
Super, super labor intensive.

00:41:33.080 --> 00:41:34.615
Then we coated the beef.

00:41:34.615 --> 00:41:37.770
And the beef is from Prather
Ranch, so grass-fed beef.

00:41:40.470 --> 00:41:42.880
The same people I've been
dealing with for so many years

00:41:42.880 --> 00:41:45.620
because it just tastes good.

00:41:45.620 --> 00:41:47.250
They take care of
their animals well.

00:41:47.250 --> 00:41:49.041
And they have their
own slaughtering house.

00:41:49.041 --> 00:41:53.010
Beginning to end, their
process is totally controlled.

00:41:53.010 --> 00:41:55.910
This is the dish of tradition.

00:41:55.910 --> 00:41:59.200
So all of our dishes are
built in some way, shape,

00:41:59.200 --> 00:42:01.280
or form on tradition.

00:42:01.280 --> 00:42:06.304
It's like I am a tiny speck in
this long continuum of cooks.

00:42:06.304 --> 00:42:07.720
And I think if you
don't know what

00:42:07.720 --> 00:42:10.790
came before, you can't
affect what comes after.

00:42:10.790 --> 00:42:14.030
And so this is basically
Boeuf Bordelaise.

00:42:14.030 --> 00:42:16.770
And it doesn't look anything
remotely like that dish.

00:42:16.770 --> 00:42:21.120
But for me, that's what it's
built on-- beef, mushrooms,

00:42:21.120 --> 00:42:23.920
spinach, marrow sauce.

00:42:23.920 --> 00:42:26.000
Except the mushrooms,
there's some mushrooms.

00:42:26.000 --> 00:42:26.560
There's some chanterelles.

00:42:26.560 --> 00:42:28.268
And sometimes we've
done it with porcini.

00:42:28.268 --> 00:42:32.420
But the mushroom, the main
mushroom, is the lichen.

00:42:32.420 --> 00:42:34.150
And the spinach is a
coastal spinach, so

00:42:34.150 --> 00:42:36.520
kind of salty and mineraly.

00:42:36.520 --> 00:42:39.250
And then the bordelaise is
infused with native spices.

00:42:39.250 --> 00:42:45.460
So wild bay with its minty,
menthol kind of aroma.

00:42:45.460 --> 00:42:47.990
The citrus of
Monterey cypress, kind

00:42:47.990 --> 00:42:52.110
of a fresh, green
anise from wild fennel.

00:42:52.110 --> 00:42:55.390
And a deep earthy licorice
from angelic root.

00:42:55.390 --> 00:42:58.209
A ton of lime juice, a
shocking amount of lime

00:42:58.209 --> 00:43:00.000
juice, even though it
doesn't taste acidic,

00:43:00.000 --> 00:43:01.890
and a little bit of
rice wine vinegar.

00:43:01.890 --> 00:43:04.590
So it looks like every
sauce you've ever had,

00:43:04.590 --> 00:43:06.430
very dark and kind of brooding.

00:43:06.430 --> 00:43:08.780
It tastes bright
and fresh and green.

00:43:08.780 --> 00:43:12.090
So it's exactly what
the tradition has been,

00:43:12.090 --> 00:43:15.290
but exactly 100 times
opposite from it.

00:43:15.290 --> 00:43:18.320
And so somehow, I think, for
me, that's what we try and get,

00:43:18.320 --> 00:43:26.310
is this connection to people,
this connection to tradition

00:43:26.310 --> 00:43:30.266
shown in a new way, synthesized
through our own sensibilities.

00:43:36.360 --> 00:43:39.532
One question I get a lot
is, oh, you wrote a book.

00:43:39.532 --> 00:43:41.240
You've had this
restaurant all this time.

00:43:41.240 --> 00:43:43.200
What's next?

00:43:43.200 --> 00:43:50.380
And I guess what's next is
cooking in my restaurant.

00:43:50.380 --> 00:43:52.530
And there's this thing
with the media that's

00:43:52.530 --> 00:43:54.820
like new, new, new, new, new.

00:43:54.820 --> 00:43:57.160
But there's something
beautiful about a restaurant.

00:43:57.160 --> 00:43:59.065
I mean, if you
really love a place

00:43:59.065 --> 00:44:02.540
and you put your heart
into it, over time

00:44:02.540 --> 00:44:04.120
it's like any relationship.

00:44:04.120 --> 00:44:07.020
Right at first, you have
this flush of newness

00:44:07.020 --> 00:44:08.570
and it's so exciting.

00:44:08.570 --> 00:44:11.960
But the depth of feeling
you get over time as you

00:44:11.960 --> 00:44:16.340
get to know this person,
this place more and more,

00:44:16.340 --> 00:44:19.430
it becomes so satisfying.

00:44:19.430 --> 00:44:21.270
Coi is the last place
I'm going to cook at.

00:44:21.270 --> 00:44:24.030
It's like the place
that-- as quirky

00:44:24.030 --> 00:44:27.910
as it is, as terrible as the
location is, we're remodeling

00:44:27.910 --> 00:44:36.080
it again in January, we keep
improving it, improving it--

00:44:36.080 --> 00:44:39.410
I'm more excited now than
I was when we opened.

00:44:39.410 --> 00:44:44.790
And so sometimes what's next
is doing what you already do,

00:44:44.790 --> 00:44:46.424
but a little bit better.

00:44:46.424 --> 00:44:47.840
And we got a great
team of people.

00:44:47.840 --> 00:44:51.520
And they allow me to
come here and talk.

00:44:51.520 --> 00:44:53.350
Which is, by the
way, totally bizarre

00:44:53.350 --> 00:44:58.130
because I never got into
restaurants to talk to people.

00:44:58.130 --> 00:45:00.980
So one of the things
that I mentioned before

00:45:00.980 --> 00:45:05.310
is this idea of a
culinary language.

00:45:05.310 --> 00:45:08.440
When I was growing up, I wasn't
good at talking to people.

00:45:08.440 --> 00:45:11.270
I didn't have a lot of
communication skills.

00:45:11.270 --> 00:45:13.770
And I think that's true of a
lot of people in restaurants.

00:45:13.770 --> 00:45:16.020
And you're probably
sitting here saying, OK,

00:45:16.020 --> 00:45:19.280
you've talked about 40
minutes straight, so--

00:45:19.280 --> 00:45:20.710
But I learned that.

00:45:20.710 --> 00:45:21.770
It's not natural.

00:45:21.770 --> 00:45:26.900
What is natural to me is
the language of cooking.

00:45:26.900 --> 00:45:30.610
And it's a nonverbal language.

00:45:30.610 --> 00:45:33.510
When I was young, I spent a lot
of time with my grandparents.

00:45:33.510 --> 00:45:38.270
My grandfather, he was the guy
who took us to restaurants.

00:45:38.270 --> 00:45:39.935
I love restaurants
from when I was

00:45:39.935 --> 00:45:41.560
an early age because
of my grandfather.

00:45:41.560 --> 00:45:42.860
I'd sit right next to him.

00:45:42.860 --> 00:45:44.960
I would get the cherries
out of his Manhattans.

00:45:44.960 --> 00:45:46.430
I felt so special.

00:45:46.430 --> 00:45:49.050
That was the moment
actually that I

00:45:49.050 --> 00:45:51.030
felt most special in my life.

00:45:51.030 --> 00:45:55.440
And I think everyone
has their own shitty

00:45:55.440 --> 00:45:58.120
stories of what did
or didn't go right

00:45:58.120 --> 00:45:59.330
when they were growing up.

00:45:59.330 --> 00:46:00.730
And my parents split up early.

00:46:00.730 --> 00:46:02.300
And I was kind of
left to my own.

00:46:02.300 --> 00:46:07.600
But that moment when I was in a
restaurant with my grandfather,

00:46:07.600 --> 00:46:11.990
I felt like the center
of the universe.

00:46:11.990 --> 00:46:13.980
And so for me, that's
what restaurants were.

00:46:13.980 --> 00:46:15.740
They were not reality.

00:46:15.740 --> 00:46:19.060
A restaurant was a place
where you could be anything,

00:46:19.060 --> 00:46:21.820
where your life could
just totally transform.

00:46:21.820 --> 00:46:27.240
My grandmother, as outgoing and
gregarious as my grandfather,

00:46:27.240 --> 00:46:29.989
she was quiet and inward.

00:46:29.989 --> 00:46:32.030
So I spent a lot of time
with her in the kitchen.

00:46:32.030 --> 00:46:33.520
She was a great cook.

00:46:33.520 --> 00:46:36.200
She was not good at
expressing herself

00:46:36.200 --> 00:46:39.570
or her love for her
family through words.

00:46:39.570 --> 00:46:42.320
But through her
cooking, it was magic.

00:46:42.320 --> 00:46:44.910
And she would cook for 30
people at the holidays.

00:46:44.910 --> 00:46:48.050
And it would be like she was
casting a spell over everyone.

00:46:48.050 --> 00:46:51.940
The way she could express
yourself through her food

00:46:51.940 --> 00:46:53.890
was incredible.

00:46:53.890 --> 00:46:54.970
She wouldn't sit down.

00:46:54.970 --> 00:46:55.950
She wouldn't eat.

00:46:55.950 --> 00:46:58.354
She stayed in the kitchen
on the stove all night.

00:46:58.354 --> 00:46:59.770
Maybe if you begged
her, you'd get

00:46:59.770 --> 00:47:03.140
her to take literally
two bites of something.

00:47:03.140 --> 00:47:07.580
And when I grew, I realized that
I became her in a lot of ways.

00:47:07.580 --> 00:47:11.060
So somehow this
is very familiar.

00:47:11.060 --> 00:47:16.230
Writing is a very familiar
form of communication.

00:47:16.230 --> 00:47:20.450
But talking, I think,
is really hard.

00:47:20.450 --> 00:47:22.760
And so the other
thing that's next--

00:47:22.760 --> 00:47:27.187
and I brought this because
we have about 120 employees.

00:47:27.187 --> 00:47:28.770
We have more than
just one restaurant.

00:47:28.770 --> 00:47:30.270
Everyone says, how do
you run four restaurants?

00:47:30.270 --> 00:47:31.790
I don't run four restaurants.

00:47:31.790 --> 00:47:33.380
That would be inhuman.

00:47:33.380 --> 00:47:35.270
I have a team of people.

00:47:35.270 --> 00:47:39.750
This is 20 people out of 120,
and just a nice little cross

00:47:39.750 --> 00:47:44.140
section of really
amazing, talented people.

00:47:44.140 --> 00:47:48.820
And so part of what's next
is to help the company grow

00:47:48.820 --> 00:47:51.140
and to stay out
of the way, to let

00:47:51.140 --> 00:47:52.800
them do what they're
good at doing.

00:47:52.800 --> 00:47:58.270
And I think as I
get older, I realize

00:47:58.270 --> 00:48:01.470
the biggest part of management
is not getting in people's way,

00:48:01.470 --> 00:48:05.800
not inhibiting their
natural ability.

00:48:05.800 --> 00:48:10.620
Out of everyone here, I
would-- and I could go on

00:48:10.620 --> 00:48:15.642
for another hour talking about
all of them-- that guy up

00:48:15.642 --> 00:48:16.600
there with the glasses?

00:48:16.600 --> 00:48:18.080
Ron Boyd, my partner?

00:48:18.080 --> 00:48:21.625
He's the guy who oversees
the other restaurants.

00:48:21.625 --> 00:48:23.940
I'm mostly a cheerleader
for the other restaurants.

00:48:23.940 --> 00:48:24.710
I go there.

00:48:24.710 --> 00:48:25.400
I have dinner.

00:48:25.400 --> 00:48:26.150
I bring people in.

00:48:26.150 --> 00:48:28.280
I say everything's awesome.

00:48:28.280 --> 00:48:32.750
And it allows me to
do the work at Coi.

00:48:32.750 --> 00:48:37.320
Ron is probably one of the
most creative, brilliant,

00:48:37.320 --> 00:48:39.420
kind, and generous
people I've ever met.

00:48:39.420 --> 00:48:41.330
And so I feel very lucky.

00:48:41.330 --> 00:48:43.090
And so part of what's
next is we have

00:48:43.090 --> 00:48:45.060
a couple of projects
for next year already.

00:48:45.060 --> 00:48:46.560
Neither one of them
are restaurants.

00:48:46.560 --> 00:48:49.730
And both of them
pretty exciting.

00:48:49.730 --> 00:48:53.290
And then this is the
other part of what's next.

00:48:53.290 --> 00:48:55.290
So I have two kids.

00:48:55.290 --> 00:48:58.880
And I always said
I wouldn't have

00:48:58.880 --> 00:49:01.420
kids that grew up without
seeing their father.

00:49:01.420 --> 00:49:03.790
So it turns out that I have
two kids that are growing up

00:49:03.790 --> 00:49:05.910
without seeing their
father so much.

00:49:05.910 --> 00:49:07.610
So I'm trying to change that.

00:49:07.610 --> 00:49:11.260
And so that's part of
having this amazing team.

00:49:11.260 --> 00:49:12.710
I have a great chef de cuisine.

00:49:17.720 --> 00:49:19.950
There's a great
quote by Paul Bocuse.

00:49:19.950 --> 00:49:21.520
Someone asked him-- he was out
of the kitchen-- and they said,

00:49:21.520 --> 00:49:22.160
who's cooking in
your kitchen tonight?

00:49:22.160 --> 00:49:25.190
And he said, the same people
that cook every night.

00:49:25.190 --> 00:49:27.960
And so having seen
this team of people

00:49:27.960 --> 00:49:34.200
allows me to have the ability
to help the company grow

00:49:34.200 --> 00:49:36.630
and also, I think,
maybe have the ability

00:49:36.630 --> 00:49:39.150
to have a little bit
more family time.

00:49:42.010 --> 00:49:45.200
So I thought maybe you
might have some questions.

00:49:45.200 --> 00:49:49.150
And then maybe you guys might
have some questions, too,

00:49:49.150 --> 00:49:53.070
about anything I talked
about, didn't talk about,

00:49:53.070 --> 00:49:54.460
embarrassing personal questions.

00:49:57.302 --> 00:49:59.260
MALE SPEAKER: I think
we're about the same age.

00:49:59.260 --> 00:50:01.676
Certainly, we followed a certain
path from the East Coast.

00:50:01.676 --> 00:50:03.960
DANIEL PATTERSON: 872 years old?

00:50:03.960 --> 00:50:04.850
That's how old I am.

00:50:04.850 --> 00:50:08.020
MALE SPEAKER: I'm 871, so
I a little bit younger.

00:50:08.020 --> 00:50:10.410
One of the things that I found
interesting in my career,

00:50:10.410 --> 00:50:14.870
and I heard you echo,
was as you started off,

00:50:14.870 --> 00:50:22.020
you had a desire to make things
more intricate or more simple.

00:50:22.020 --> 00:50:25.200
And if that makes
sense, you have evolved.

00:50:25.200 --> 00:50:29.850
And it sounds like Coi
is maybe not your end

00:50:29.850 --> 00:50:33.350
game, but your
ultimate evolution.

00:50:33.350 --> 00:50:34.960
Would you say that that's true?

00:50:34.960 --> 00:50:36.460
DANIEL PATTERSON:
Yeah, that's true.

00:50:36.460 --> 00:50:39.080
Although the thing about
evolution is it never stops.

00:50:39.080 --> 00:50:43.050
So like for me, it's
a constant refinement.

00:50:43.050 --> 00:50:45.727
And it's about hiding
our work, our effort.

00:50:45.727 --> 00:50:46.560
MALE SPEAKER: Right.

00:50:46.560 --> 00:50:48.768
DANIEL PATTERSON: If you
see the effort on the plate,

00:50:48.768 --> 00:50:50.130
we've done something wrong.

00:50:50.130 --> 00:50:52.890
So the work should
stay in the kitchen.

00:50:52.890 --> 00:50:55.010
And what's on the
plate should be easy.

00:50:55.010 --> 00:50:57.090
It should be like,
no one should have

00:50:57.090 --> 00:50:58.920
to wonder how to eat something.

00:50:58.920 --> 00:51:01.200
And this is just my own feeling.

00:51:01.200 --> 00:51:03.290
Or when they eat
it, they shouldn't

00:51:03.290 --> 00:51:05.180
wonder what they're eating.

00:51:05.180 --> 00:51:06.120
So we go for flavor.

00:51:06.120 --> 00:51:10.440
When you talk about
simplicity, simple is hard.

00:51:10.440 --> 00:51:16.180
Simple, to mean concentrated,
clear, distillation,

00:51:16.180 --> 00:51:19.130
of a flavor that's
just like a pinpoint

00:51:19.130 --> 00:51:22.650
and like a shock of
recognition, to deliver

00:51:22.650 --> 00:51:25.649
that every single time?

00:51:25.649 --> 00:51:26.440
That's really hard.

00:51:26.440 --> 00:51:27.960
And so that's really
what our focus is.

00:51:27.960 --> 00:51:29.293
And that comes from ingredients.

00:51:29.293 --> 00:51:30.380
It comes from technique.

00:51:30.380 --> 00:51:32.520
And it comes from
knowing when to stop,

00:51:32.520 --> 00:51:34.080
I think, a little bit, too.

00:51:34.080 --> 00:51:35.880
MALE SPEAKER: Over-manipulation.

00:51:35.880 --> 00:51:38.170
DANIEL PATTERSON: Yeah, I
mean, it's a tough thing.

00:51:38.170 --> 00:51:43.040
Because I think the second you
take a chicken and kill him,

00:51:43.040 --> 00:51:43.910
you manipulate it.

00:51:43.910 --> 00:51:45.470
And then you put it in the
oven, you manipulate it again.

00:51:45.470 --> 00:51:48.330
So you have roast chicken, which
is the least manipulated thing.

00:51:48.330 --> 00:51:50.730
But everything is manipulation.

00:51:50.730 --> 00:51:54.640
But for me, it's more a
matter of understanding

00:51:54.640 --> 00:51:59.880
the proper limits of a dish.

00:51:59.880 --> 00:52:03.000
Each dish has its own
moment where you just

00:52:03.000 --> 00:52:06.570
need to have the
intuition to know

00:52:06.570 --> 00:52:08.670
when to stop, to add something.

00:52:08.670 --> 00:52:11.596
And I think intuition is
the hardest thing to teach,

00:52:11.596 --> 00:52:12.270
I think.

00:52:12.270 --> 00:52:13.665
MALE SPEAKER: Only
comes with time, right?

00:52:13.665 --> 00:52:15.255
DANIEL PATTERSON: Or
it doesn't come at all.

00:52:15.255 --> 00:52:16.590
MALE SPEAKER: Many
times, unfortunately.

00:52:16.590 --> 00:52:18.590
DANIEL PATTERSON: Yeah,
I mean, let's be honest.

00:52:18.590 --> 00:52:21.000
I think you can teach
anyone how to cook well.

00:52:21.000 --> 00:52:24.090
But there's a certain point
at which you can't really

00:52:24.090 --> 00:52:29.330
teach someone to make a
connection that's not already

00:52:29.330 --> 00:52:31.090
in place.

00:52:31.090 --> 00:52:32.920
But you can teach
someone to make

00:52:32.920 --> 00:52:35.100
a connection that
has been established.

00:52:35.100 --> 00:52:38.040
MALE SPEAKER: As a chef,
there are many things

00:52:38.040 --> 00:52:41.126
that people do in my kitchen
that have infuriated me.

00:52:41.126 --> 00:52:44.087
What is an example for you?

00:52:44.087 --> 00:52:45.420
DANIEL PATTERSON: You know what?

00:52:45.420 --> 00:52:53.584
It's funny because-- I mean--
I'm so much better than I was.

00:52:53.584 --> 00:52:55.000
But if you caught
me 10 years ago?

00:52:55.000 --> 00:52:56.450
Oh, my God.

00:52:56.450 --> 00:52:59.460
But even now, like
what just sends me

00:52:59.460 --> 00:53:02.590
through the roof
is just not caring.

00:53:02.590 --> 00:53:05.020
I feel like when people
come into a restaurant,

00:53:05.020 --> 00:53:06.660
they've given us their trust.

00:53:06.660 --> 00:53:07.800
And that trust is sacred.

00:53:07.800 --> 00:53:12.230
And when I feel like people
haven't taken that seriously,

00:53:12.230 --> 00:53:15.040
that's the only thing.

00:53:15.040 --> 00:53:17.800
We have so many
safety nets in place,

00:53:17.800 --> 00:53:21.060
it's almost impossible
for a mistake

00:53:21.060 --> 00:53:23.670
to get to the dining
room at this point

00:53:23.670 --> 00:53:26.650
because we have so many checks
and balances along the way.

00:53:26.650 --> 00:53:28.750
But not caring is
the only thing.

00:53:28.750 --> 00:53:30.940
So if you make a
mistake, we're human.

00:53:30.940 --> 00:53:31.690
We make mistakes.

00:53:31.690 --> 00:53:34.830
That's not something
that makes me upset.

00:53:34.830 --> 00:53:37.560
But not caring or not
trying hard enough

00:53:37.560 --> 00:53:39.320
is the thing that gets me.

00:53:39.320 --> 00:53:42.360
Because it's like, if you
don't want to work that hard,

00:53:42.360 --> 00:53:47.290
go to another restaurant
that has a simpler form where

00:53:47.290 --> 00:53:48.890
you don't have to
work that hard.

00:53:48.890 --> 00:53:50.340
Our form demands a lot of work.

00:53:50.340 --> 00:53:53.590
And it demands a lot of caring.

00:53:53.590 --> 00:53:57.340
And the caring is the thing
that is the most important.

00:53:57.340 --> 00:54:00.590
If you care and you make
a mistake, ah, it happens.

00:54:00.590 --> 00:54:04.259
And we get some young
cooks that come in.

00:54:04.259 --> 00:54:05.300
Sure, they make mistakes.

00:54:05.300 --> 00:54:06.300
They're not experienced.

00:54:06.300 --> 00:54:07.810
But a lot of heart.

00:54:07.810 --> 00:54:11.270
And that's what matters.

00:54:11.270 --> 00:54:14.590
MALE SPEAKER: How do
you feel about the epic

00:54:14.590 --> 00:54:17.000
issue with obesity
in this country,

00:54:17.000 --> 00:54:20.840
the government's attempt
to either tax soda,

00:54:20.840 --> 00:54:25.300
or perhaps to
inspire people to eat

00:54:25.300 --> 00:54:26.920
better which I'm
certainly a fan of?

00:54:26.920 --> 00:54:28.590
But I'd love your
thoughts on that.

00:54:28.590 --> 00:54:31.720
You don't necessarily
deal with healthy eating

00:54:31.720 --> 00:54:34.450
as a focus in Coi.

00:54:34.450 --> 00:54:36.700
DANIEL PATTERSON: Yeah, it's
funny you mentioned that.

00:54:36.700 --> 00:54:38.450
So for about three
years, we've been

00:54:38.450 --> 00:54:40.552
working with Larkin
Street Youth Services.

00:54:40.552 --> 00:54:41.260
MALE SPEAKER: OK.

00:54:41.260 --> 00:54:45.100
DANIEL PATTERSON: And you get
hit up a lot in restaurants

00:54:45.100 --> 00:54:52.640
for, why don't you make
1,000 pieces of something

00:54:52.640 --> 00:54:56.940
on a shitty piece of toast
for the opera or something?

00:54:56.940 --> 00:54:59.760
And you feel nickel
and dimed a little bit.

00:54:59.760 --> 00:55:02.940
And I thought, well, why don't
we just take a lot of energy

00:55:02.940 --> 00:55:07.450
and put it in one place that
is doing work that we really

00:55:07.450 --> 00:55:11.147
believe in, that has our values.

00:55:11.147 --> 00:55:13.730
And this is an organization that
takes kids in off the street.

00:55:13.730 --> 00:55:16.380
They give them counseling
and job training

00:55:16.380 --> 00:55:18.315
and a place to stay and food.

00:55:18.315 --> 00:55:19.530
MALE SPEAKER: OK.

00:55:19.530 --> 00:55:21.520
DANIEL PATTERSON: And so we've
tried a lot of different things

00:55:21.520 --> 00:55:22.020
with them.

00:55:22.020 --> 00:55:24.910
But the thing that
worked best is I

00:55:24.910 --> 00:55:28.030
finally called them and said,
look, bring some kids over.

00:55:28.030 --> 00:55:29.540
We're closed on Mondays.

00:55:29.540 --> 00:55:31.470
I'll do a cooking class.

00:55:31.470 --> 00:55:34.750
And these are kids who grew up,
a lot of them, with processed

00:55:34.750 --> 00:55:36.690
food, without healthy food.

00:55:36.690 --> 00:55:40.580
A lot of things that
are so, so, basic to me,

00:55:40.580 --> 00:55:42.340
they've never seen before.

00:55:42.340 --> 00:55:45.607
And it wasn't like we were on
opposite sides of the table.

00:55:45.607 --> 00:55:46.940
Like, OK, everyone come on back.

00:55:46.940 --> 00:55:47.500
Here's some cutting boards.

00:55:47.500 --> 00:55:48.340
Here's some knives.

00:55:48.340 --> 00:55:50.520
Try not to cut your fingers off.

00:55:50.520 --> 00:55:52.040
And let's cook some food.

00:55:52.040 --> 00:55:52.730
Lets have fun.

00:55:52.730 --> 00:55:55.165
So the whole thing
is delicious and fun.

00:55:55.165 --> 00:55:57.530
And get people with A, a
taste memory of something

00:55:57.530 --> 00:55:59.160
that's good for them
that's delicious.

00:55:59.160 --> 00:56:01.180
Because if there's no
taste memory of good food,

00:56:01.180 --> 00:56:05.550
there's no way to reorient--
the way we're put together,

00:56:05.550 --> 00:56:08.105
if you grow up being
comforted by potato chips,

00:56:08.105 --> 00:56:09.480
potato chips is
what you're going

00:56:09.480 --> 00:56:13.041
to reach for in a time
of stress or crisis.

00:56:13.041 --> 00:56:14.790
And if someone gives
you a bowl of greens,

00:56:14.790 --> 00:56:17.530
but you have no
association with them?

00:56:17.530 --> 00:56:19.350
You're not going to crave them.

00:56:19.350 --> 00:56:21.800
But if you have a bowl of
greens that's delicious,

00:56:21.800 --> 00:56:25.410
and you associate it
with this very fun day

00:56:25.410 --> 00:56:27.610
that you're hanging
out with these people

00:56:27.610 --> 00:56:31.280
who you're living with, and then
you have this good experience,

00:56:31.280 --> 00:56:34.030
then you're like, oh,
I'd eat that again.

00:56:34.030 --> 00:56:35.940
Because it's not
just good, but it's

00:56:35.940 --> 00:56:38.830
connected to a good feeling.

00:56:38.830 --> 00:56:41.650
And then the other thing
is having some basic tools

00:56:41.650 --> 00:56:44.620
to feed themself at
home that good food.

00:56:44.620 --> 00:56:47.510
And so we started something
called The Cooking Project.

00:56:47.510 --> 00:56:51.020
And right now it's out of
San Francisco Cooking School.

00:56:51.020 --> 00:56:54.750
And it focuses tightly
on the Tenderloin,

00:56:54.750 --> 00:56:58.450
using products that they can
get in their neighborhood.

00:56:58.450 --> 00:57:00.650
We have a different chef
come every other week

00:57:00.650 --> 00:57:03.010
and teach them one
or two little things,

00:57:03.010 --> 00:57:04.940
things that they can
tell a story about,

00:57:04.940 --> 00:57:08.310
things that have meaning,
whether it's a pasta,

00:57:08.310 --> 00:57:11.600
we've had different
kinds of porridge,

00:57:11.600 --> 00:57:15.360
different kinds of
stews, salads, whatever.

00:57:15.360 --> 00:57:18.430
And then afterwards--
everyone makes all the food

00:57:18.430 --> 00:57:20.580
and they sit down
and eat it together.

00:57:20.580 --> 00:57:23.520
And in a way, that's even
like the best part of it.

00:57:23.520 --> 00:57:26.199
So it's a very modest program.

00:57:26.199 --> 00:57:27.740
We're not trying to
change the world.

00:57:27.740 --> 00:57:30.530
But I don't think you can
have too many people working

00:57:30.530 --> 00:57:31.570
on this.

00:57:31.570 --> 00:57:33.600
Ours is just like maybe
at the end of the year,

00:57:33.600 --> 00:57:35.880
200 kids know how
to feed themself

00:57:35.880 --> 00:57:38.270
a little bit better
than they did before.

00:57:38.270 --> 00:57:39.990
I think that's pretty great.

00:57:39.990 --> 00:57:42.610
MALE SPEAKER: What do you
tell, with the outbreak

00:57:42.610 --> 00:57:45.514
of the celebrity chef,
certainly, there's

00:57:45.514 --> 00:57:46.180
the television--

00:57:46.180 --> 00:57:48.639
DANIEL PATTERSON: Like a virus.

00:57:48.639 --> 00:57:50.180
MALE SPEAKER: I
mean, to some extent,

00:57:50.180 --> 00:57:53.900
I mean, I know Bobby
Flay, Morimoto.

00:57:53.900 --> 00:57:55.779
I know that they can cook.

00:57:55.779 --> 00:57:56.570
I do not know them.

00:57:56.570 --> 00:57:58.210
But I know that they can cook.

00:57:58.210 --> 00:58:00.770
They did not get there
because they couldn't.

00:58:00.770 --> 00:58:03.950
I know that there's
plenty of chefs on TV

00:58:03.950 --> 00:58:09.700
that are great personalities
and are able to excite people.

00:58:09.700 --> 00:58:13.560
I also know that I
have kids from 10 to 20

00:58:13.560 --> 00:58:18.360
coming up to me saying,
I want to be a chef.

00:58:18.360 --> 00:58:22.590
DANIEL PATTERSON:
Well, every development

00:58:22.590 --> 00:58:25.510
that's new in culture
has good things

00:58:25.510 --> 00:58:28.000
and it always has side effects.

00:58:28.000 --> 00:58:30.530
You don't get any
forward movement

00:58:30.530 --> 00:58:34.240
without a little bit of
negative side effect.

00:58:34.240 --> 00:58:44.560
This fetishization of
chefs is like crazy time.

00:58:44.560 --> 00:58:48.100
We're manual laborers.

00:58:48.100 --> 00:58:52.160
We're like the people who
lay carpet or paint walls

00:58:52.160 --> 00:58:55.540
or put woodwork in.

00:58:55.540 --> 00:58:56.860
That's our job.

00:58:56.860 --> 00:58:59.360
Our job really hasn't
changed for 100 years.

00:58:59.360 --> 00:59:01.100
Our perception of
the job was changed.

00:59:01.100 --> 00:59:03.910
But at the end of the day, we
don't have coal in our ovens

00:59:03.910 --> 00:59:04.410
anymore.

00:59:04.410 --> 00:59:05.700
So that's a big improvement.

00:59:05.700 --> 00:59:09.220
MALE SPEAKER: Sometimes you
do now in flavoring things.

00:59:09.220 --> 00:59:10.470
DANIEL PATTERSON: That's true.

00:59:10.470 --> 00:59:12.360
But at least we're
not breathing it in.

00:59:12.360 --> 00:59:17.510
But I think our approach is
much more human in the kitchen.

00:59:17.510 --> 00:59:23.560
We're much more cognizant of
people's emotional development.

00:59:23.560 --> 00:59:28.580
I always think, how do I
create an environment that

00:59:28.580 --> 00:59:32.050
supports people to be
as good as they can be?

00:59:32.050 --> 00:59:33.550
So we're thinking
about these things

00:59:33.550 --> 00:59:34.860
a lot more than we used to.

00:59:34.860 --> 00:59:36.720
But the basic job is the same.

00:59:36.720 --> 00:59:39.470
You have raw ingredients
that you transform into food.

00:59:39.470 --> 00:59:42.020
And it takes a lot of
work and a lot of hours.

00:59:42.020 --> 00:59:46.260
So however that's
being contextualized,

00:59:46.260 --> 00:59:48.590
to the extent that it
brings people closer

00:59:48.590 --> 00:59:50.970
to thinking about what
they put in their bodies,

00:59:50.970 --> 00:59:52.090
I think it's great.

00:59:52.090 --> 00:59:55.220
And if a little bit
of that is that people

00:59:55.220 --> 00:59:58.405
have this idea that it's a
glamorous profession, ah, come

00:59:58.405 --> 01:00:01.160
on, they'll learn soon enough.

01:00:01.160 --> 01:00:02.810
MALE SPEAKER: Hear, hear.

01:00:02.810 --> 01:00:05.340
Thank you so much for
allowing me to host this

01:00:05.340 --> 01:00:07.140
and for coming to San Francisco.

01:00:07.140 --> 01:00:07.940
DANIEL PATTERSON:
Thank you so much--

01:00:07.940 --> 01:00:08.670
MALE SPEAKER: It was
an absolute pleasure.

01:00:08.670 --> 01:00:09.570
DANIEL PATTERSON:
--for having me.

01:00:09.570 --> 01:00:10.070
[APPLAUSE]

01:00:10.070 --> 01:00:12.020
DANIEL PATTERSON: Hey,
thanks for coming.
