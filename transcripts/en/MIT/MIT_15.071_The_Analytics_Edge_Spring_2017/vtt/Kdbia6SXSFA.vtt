00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:08.600
In this video, we'll discuss
how we can create visualizations

00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:12.490
that are used in
predictive policing models.

00:00:12.490 --> 00:00:15.430
In almost every
application, before we even

00:00:15.430 --> 00:00:17.980
consider a predictive
model, we should

00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:21.560
try to understand
the historical data.

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:25.340
Many cities in the United
States and around the world,

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:30.260
provide logs of reported crimes,
usually the time, location,

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:32.640
and nature of the event.

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:36.350
In this lecture, we'll use
data from the city of Chicago,

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:38.810
in the United States,
about motor vehicle thefts.

00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:43.820
Given this data
on crimes, suppose

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:45.950
we wanted to communicate
crime patterns

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:48.560
over the course of
an average week.

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:52.690
We could display daily crime
averages using a line graph,

00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:57.030
like the one shown here, but
this doesn't seem too useful.

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:00.960
We can see that crime tends to
be higher on Saturday, but when

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:04.400
on Saturday, and where?

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:08.830
We could replace our x-axis
with the hour of the day

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:11.780
and have a different line
for every day of the week

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:15.760
to understand when crime
occurs in more detail.

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:19.150
But this would be a jumbled mess
with seven lines, and probably

00:01:19.150 --> 00:01:21.150
very hard to read.

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:24.660
We could instead use no
visualization at all,

00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:27.810
and instead present
information in a table,

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:30.039
like the one shown here.

00:01:30.039 --> 00:01:33.650
For each hour and day,
we have the total number

00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:36.240
of crimes that occurred.

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:39.030
This is a valid
representation of the data,

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:43.460
but large tables of numbers can
be hard to read and understand.

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:46.590
So how can we make the table
more interesting and usable?

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:51.700
A great way to
visualize information

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:55.550
in a two-dimensional
table is with a heat map.

00:01:55.550 --> 00:02:00.050
Heat maps visualize data
using three attributes.

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:04.030
Two of the attributes are on
the x and y-axes, typically

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:07.990
displayed horizontally
and vertically.

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:12.400
The third attribute is
represented by shades of color.

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:16.930
In this example, lower
values in the third attribute

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:19.780
correspond to colors
closer to blue,

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:22.280
and higher values in
the third attribute

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:25.780
correspond to colors
closer to red.

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:29.920
For example, the x-axis
could be hours of the day,

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:32.910
the y-axis could be
days of the week,

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:36.020
and the colors could correspond
to the amount of crime.

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:42.000
In a heat map, we can pick
different color schemes

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:46.150
based on the type of data to
convey different messages.

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:49.560
In crime, a yellow
to red color scheme

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:52.410
might be appropriate
because it can highlight

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:55.230
some of the more
dangerous areas in red.

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:59.760
Your eye is naturally drawn
to the red areas of the plot.

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:03.380
In other applications,
both high and low values

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:07.050
are meaningful, so having
a more varied color scheme

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:09.180
might be useful.

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:11.340
And in other applications,
you might only

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:13.970
want to see cells
with high values,

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:17.550
so you could use a gray scale to
make the cells with low values

00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:19.380
white.

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:24.360
The x and y-axes in a heat map
don't need to be continuous.

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:27.680
In our example, we have a
categorical or factor variable

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:29.960
-- the day of the week.

00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:32.840
And we can even
combine a heat map

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:35.079
with a geographical
map, which we'll

00:03:35.079 --> 00:03:37.660
discuss later in this lecture.

00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:40.030
This type of heat map
is frequently used

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:46.100
in predictive policing to show
crime hot spots in a city.

00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:49.400
In this lecture, we'll use
Chicago motor vehicle theft

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:53.120
data to explore patterns
of crime, both over days

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:57.130
of the week, and over
hours of the day.

00:03:57.130 --> 00:04:00.880
We're interested in analyzing
the total number of car thefts

00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:03.470
that occur in any
particular hour

00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:07.420
of a day of the week
over our whole data set.

00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:10.280
In the next video,
we'll switch to R,

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:12.390
and start by
creating a basic line

00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:16.890
plot counting the total
crime by the day of the week.
