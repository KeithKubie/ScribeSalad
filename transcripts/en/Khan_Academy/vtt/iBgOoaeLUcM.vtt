00:00:00.721 --> 00:00:02.067
- [Voiceover] So a lot of the ways that we

00:00:02.067 --> 00:00:04.041
represent multivariable functions

00:00:04.041 --> 00:00:05.875
assume that you're
fluent with understanding

00:00:05.875 --> 00:00:08.522
how to represent points
in three-dimensions

00:00:08.522 --> 00:00:11.100
and also how to represent
vectors in three-dimensions.

00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:13.259
So I thought I'd make
a little video here to,

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:15.279
spell out exactly how
it is that we describe

00:00:15.279 --> 00:00:17.369
points and vectors in three-dimensions.

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:18.646
And before we do that,

00:00:18.646 --> 00:00:20.202
I think it will be valuable

00:00:20.202 --> 00:00:22.036
if we start off by describing

00:00:22.036 --> 00:00:24.753
points and vectors in two-dimensions.

00:00:24.753 --> 00:00:26.495
And, I'm assuming if you're learning

00:00:26.495 --> 00:00:27.632
about multivariable calculus,

00:00:27.632 --> 00:00:29.351
that a lot of you have
already learned about this.

00:00:29.351 --> 00:00:30.396
And you might be saying

00:00:30.396 --> 00:00:31.417
what's the point?

00:00:31.417 --> 00:00:32.926
I already know how to represent,

00:00:32.926 --> 00:00:36.015
points and vectors in two-dimensions.

00:00:36.015 --> 00:00:38.824
But there is a huge value in analogy here,

00:00:38.824 --> 00:00:40.984
because as soon as you start to compare

00:00:40.984 --> 00:00:42.911
two dimensions and three-dimensions,

00:00:42.911 --> 00:00:46.115
you start to see patterns for how it could

00:00:46.115 --> 00:00:47.996
extend to other dimensions that you

00:00:47.996 --> 00:00:49.459
can't necessarily visualize,

00:00:49.459 --> 00:00:51.433
or when it might be useful to think about

00:00:51.433 --> 00:00:53.244
one dimension versus another.

00:00:53.244 --> 00:00:55.914
So in two-dimensions, if
you have some kind of point

00:00:55.914 --> 00:00:58.863
just, you know, off sitting there.

00:00:58.863 --> 00:00:59.931
We typically represent it,

00:00:59.931 --> 00:01:01.998
you've got an x-axis and a y-axis

00:01:01.998 --> 00:01:03.716
that a perpendicular to each other.

00:01:03.716 --> 00:01:05.945
And we represent this number with a pair.

00:01:05.945 --> 00:01:10.636
Sorry, we represent this
point with a pair of numbers.

00:01:10.636 --> 00:01:11.936
So in this case, I don't know,

00:01:11.936 --> 00:01:13.482
it might be something like one, three.

00:01:13.482 --> 00:01:14.950
And what that would represent,

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:16.685
is it's saying that you
have to move a distance

00:01:16.685 --> 00:01:19.185
of one along the x-axis

00:01:20.261 --> 00:01:24.139
and then a distance of
three up along the y-axis.

00:01:24.139 --> 00:01:26.809
So you know this, let's say
that's a distance of one,

00:01:26.809 --> 00:01:27.947
that's a distance of three,

00:01:27.947 --> 00:01:29.340
it might not be exactly
that the way I drew it,

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:32.359
but let's say that those
are the coordinates.

00:01:32.359 --> 00:01:33.357
What this means is that every

00:01:33.357 --> 00:01:35.772
point in two dimensional space

00:01:35.772 --> 00:01:37.595
can be given a pair of numbers like this

00:01:37.595 --> 00:01:38.907
and you think of them as instructions

00:01:38.907 --> 00:01:39.929
where it's kind of telling you

00:01:39.929 --> 00:01:41.159
how far to walk in one way,

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:43.017
how far to walk in another.

00:01:43.017 --> 00:01:45.385
But you can also think
of the reverse, right?

00:01:45.385 --> 00:01:47.754
Every time that you have a pair of things

00:01:47.754 --> 00:01:50.726
you know that you should be
thinking two-dimensionaly

00:01:50.726 --> 00:01:51.887
and that's actually,

00:01:51.887 --> 00:01:53.536
a surprisingly powerful idea that

00:01:53.536 --> 00:01:55.672
I don't think I
appreciated for a long time

00:01:55.672 --> 00:01:57.599
how there's this back and forth between

00:01:57.599 --> 00:01:59.317
pairs of numbers and points in space

00:01:59.317 --> 00:02:01.291
and it lets you visualize things

00:02:01.291 --> 00:02:02.661
you didn't think you could visualize,

00:02:02.661 --> 00:02:03.497
or lets you understand things

00:02:03.497 --> 00:02:04.774
that are inherently visual just by

00:02:04.774 --> 00:02:06.562
kinda going back and forth.

00:02:06.562 --> 00:02:08.025
And in three-two-dimensions

00:02:08.025 --> 00:02:10.068
there's a similar dichotomy, but between

00:02:10.068 --> 00:02:12.458
triplets of points and

00:02:12.458 --> 00:02:13.898
points in three-dimensional space.

00:02:13.898 --> 00:02:16.684
So, let me just plop down a point

00:02:16.684 --> 00:02:18.751
in three-dimensional space here,

00:02:18.751 --> 00:02:20.097
and it's hard to get a feel for exactly

00:02:20.097 --> 00:02:22.396
where it is until you move things around.

00:02:22.396 --> 00:02:24.300
This is one thing that
makes three-dimensions hard

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:26.158
is you can't really draw it without

00:02:26.158 --> 00:02:27.946
moving it around or showing,

00:02:27.946 --> 00:02:30.732
showing a difference in
perspective in various ways.

00:02:30.732 --> 00:02:32.357
But we describe points like this,

00:02:32.357 --> 00:02:34.772
again with a set of coordinates,

00:02:34.772 --> 00:02:36.700
but this time it's a triplet.

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:39.347
And this particular point,

00:02:39.347 --> 00:02:43.447
I happen to know is one, two, five.

00:02:43.447 --> 00:02:46.464
And what those numbers are telling you is

00:02:46.464 --> 00:02:49.250
how far to move, parallel to each axis.

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:51.015
So just like with two dimensions,

00:02:51.015 --> 00:02:52.780
we have an x-axis,

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:54.266
and a y-axis.

00:02:54.266 --> 00:02:55.473
But now there's a third axis that's

00:02:55.473 --> 00:02:57.238
perpendicular to both of them,

00:02:57.238 --> 00:03:00.489
and moves us into that
third-dimension, the z-axis.

00:03:00.489 --> 00:03:02.369
And the first number in our coordinate

00:03:02.369 --> 00:03:04.204
is gonna tell us how far,

00:03:04.204 --> 00:03:06.967
whoop, can't move those guys,

00:03:06.967 --> 00:03:09.591
how far we need to move in the x direction

00:03:09.591 --> 00:03:10.938
as our first step.

00:03:10.938 --> 00:03:12.934
The second number, two in this case,

00:03:12.934 --> 00:03:14.676
tells us how far we need to move

00:03:14.676 --> 00:03:17.857
parallel to the y-axis,
for our second step.

00:03:17.857 --> 00:03:20.365
And then the third number
tells us how far up

00:03:20.365 --> 00:03:23.105
we have to go to get to that point.

00:03:23.105 --> 00:03:24.591
And you can do this for any point

00:03:24.591 --> 00:03:26.193
in three-dimensional space, right?

00:03:26.193 --> 00:03:27.308
Any point that you have you can

00:03:27.308 --> 00:03:28.747
give the instructions for how to move

00:03:28.747 --> 00:03:30.942
along the x, and then how
to move parallel to the y

00:03:30.942 --> 00:03:32.196
and how to move parallel to the z

00:03:32.196 --> 00:03:33.473
to get to that point,

00:03:33.473 --> 00:03:35.609
which means there's this back and forth

00:03:35.609 --> 00:03:38.604
between triplets of
numbers and points in 3-D.

00:03:38.604 --> 00:03:40.648
So whenever you come
across a triplet of things,

00:03:40.648 --> 00:03:41.728
and you'll see this in the next video

00:03:41.728 --> 00:03:44.119
when we start talking about
three-dimensional graphs,

00:03:44.119 --> 00:03:45.547
you'll know, just by virtue of the

00:03:45.547 --> 00:03:46.407
fact that it's a triplet

00:03:46.407 --> 00:03:49.379
"Ah, yes, I should be thinking
in three-dimensions somehow"

00:03:49.379 --> 00:03:51.376
just in the same way
whenever you have pairs

00:03:51.376 --> 00:03:52.258
you should be thinking

00:03:52.258 --> 00:03:54.859
ah, this is a very two-dimensional thing.

00:03:54.859 --> 00:03:56.879
So, there's another context though

00:03:56.879 --> 00:04:00.037
where pairs of numbers come up

00:04:00.037 --> 00:04:01.894
and that would be vectors.

00:04:01.894 --> 00:04:03.427
So a vector you might represent,

00:04:03.427 --> 00:04:05.958
you know you typically it with an arrow.

00:04:05.958 --> 00:04:06.840
Oh,

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:07.792
ahh.

00:04:07.792 --> 00:04:11.125
Help, help! (chuckling)

00:04:14.317 --> 00:04:15.234
So vectors,

00:04:16.639 --> 00:04:19.890
So vectors we typically
represent some kind of arrow,

00:04:19.890 --> 00:04:22.307
let's, this arrow nice color.

00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:24.543
An arrow.

00:04:26.961 --> 00:04:30.676
And if it's a vector from
the origin to a simple point,

00:04:30.676 --> 00:04:33.904
the coordinates of that vector

00:04:33.904 --> 00:04:35.668
are just the same as those of the point.

00:04:35.668 --> 00:04:36.783
And the convention is to write

00:04:36.783 --> 00:04:38.594
those coordinates in a column.

00:04:38.594 --> 00:04:39.499
You know, it's not set in stone,

00:04:39.499 --> 00:04:40.986
but typically if you
see numbers in a column

00:04:40.986 --> 00:04:42.750
you should be thinking
about it as a vector,

00:04:42.750 --> 00:04:43.818
some kind of arrow.

00:04:43.818 --> 00:04:45.931
And if it's a pair with
parenthesis around it

00:04:45.931 --> 00:04:47.835
you just think about it as a point.

00:04:47.835 --> 00:04:49.484
And even though, you know, both of these

00:04:49.484 --> 00:04:51.783
are ways of representing
the same pair of numbers,

00:04:51.783 --> 00:04:53.896
the main difference is that a vector

00:04:53.896 --> 00:04:55.661
you could have started
at any point in space

00:04:55.661 --> 00:04:57.332
it didn't have to start in the origin.

00:04:57.332 --> 00:04:58.772
So if we have that same guy,

00:04:58.772 --> 00:04:59.956
but you know if he starts here

00:04:59.956 --> 00:05:01.953
and he still has a
rightward component of one

00:05:01.953 --> 00:05:04.136
and an upward component of three,

00:05:04.136 --> 00:05:06.040
we think of that as the same vector.

00:05:06.040 --> 00:05:10.289
And typically these are
representing motion of some kind

00:05:10.289 --> 00:05:11.984
whereas points are just representing

00:05:11.984 --> 00:05:14.317
like actual points in space.

00:05:15.235 --> 00:05:17.232
And the other big thing that you can do

00:05:17.232 --> 00:05:18.881
is you can add vectors together.

00:05:18.881 --> 00:05:20.877
So, you know, if you had another,

00:05:20.877 --> 00:05:23.339
let's say you have another vector

00:05:23.339 --> 00:05:24.662
that has a large x component

00:05:24.662 --> 00:05:29.492
but a small negative y
component, like this guy.

00:05:29.492 --> 00:05:31.489
And what that means is
that you can kind of add

00:05:31.489 --> 00:05:33.881
like, imagining that second vector started

00:05:33.881 --> 00:05:36.131
at the tip of the first one

00:05:37.991 --> 00:05:39.825
and then however you get from the origin

00:05:39.825 --> 00:05:41.172
to the new tip there,

00:05:41.172 --> 00:05:43.633
that's gonna be the resulting vector, so

00:05:43.633 --> 00:05:47.325
I'd say this is, this is the
sum of those two vectors.

00:05:47.325 --> 00:05:49.415
And you can't really do
that with points as much.

00:05:49.415 --> 00:05:51.040
In order to think about adding points

00:05:51.040 --> 00:05:53.223
you end up thinking about them as vectors.

00:05:53.223 --> 00:05:56.033
And the same goes with three-dimensions.

00:05:56.033 --> 00:05:58.552
For a given point, if you draw an arrow

00:05:58.552 --> 00:06:01.302
from the origin up to that point,

00:06:02.407 --> 00:06:04.125
this arrow would be represented

00:06:04.125 --> 00:06:05.890
with that same triplet of numbers,

00:06:05.890 --> 00:06:08.676
but you typically do it in a column,

00:06:08.676 --> 00:06:09.977
I call this a column vector.

00:06:09.977 --> 00:06:12.477
That's not three, that's five.

00:06:13.924 --> 00:06:14.888
And the difference between the point

00:06:14.888 --> 00:06:16.745
and the arrow is you can think of,

00:06:16.745 --> 00:06:18.463
you know the arrow or the vector

00:06:18.463 --> 00:06:19.810
is starting anywhere in space,

00:06:19.810 --> 00:06:20.716
it doesn't really matter,

00:06:20.716 --> 00:06:23.131
as long as it's got those same components

00:06:23.131 --> 00:06:24.965
for how far does it
move parallel to the x,

00:06:24.965 --> 00:06:27.775
for how far does it move
parallel to the y-axis,

00:06:27.775 --> 00:06:30.747
and for how far does it
move parallel to the z-axis.

00:06:30.747 --> 00:06:32.001
So in the next video,

00:06:32.001 --> 00:06:34.764
I'll show how we use
these three-dimensions

00:06:34.764 --> 00:06:37.963
to start graphing multivariable functions.
