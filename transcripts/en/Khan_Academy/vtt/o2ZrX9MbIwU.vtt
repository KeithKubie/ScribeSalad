00:00:01.120 --> 00:00:01.950
Welcome back.

00:00:01.950 --> 00:00:03.680
So we just figured out
how long does this

00:00:03.680 --> 00:00:04.850
thing stay in the air.

00:00:04.850 --> 00:00:06.190
So what can we do with that?

00:00:06.190 --> 00:00:09.510
Let me clear all of this and
redraw it because maybe every

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:12.890
time I redraw it, it might
further clarify things.

00:00:15.520 --> 00:00:18.710
Let me actually draw things a
little bit fancier this time.

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:24.430
So I have the ball and it's
moving-- look at that.

00:00:24.430 --> 00:00:27.530
Let me just draw the triangle
ahead of time.

00:00:27.530 --> 00:00:29.960
I'm going to use
fancy-- whoops.

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:33.070
Actually, let me use
a thicker line.

00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:37.540
So this was the initial
vector.

00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:41.460
Then I wanted to do--
switch to green.

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:42.670
This is its horizontal.

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:44.070
I'm going to draw the
arrows in a second.

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:48.070
I just want to get all the line
tool work out of the way.

00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:49.160
Bam.

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:55.430
And this is the--
close enough.

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:58.310
And then, if I use my
paint tool, I could

00:00:58.310 --> 00:01:00.260
draw an arrow there.

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:01.880
Switch back to green.

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:03.370
Draw an arrow there.

00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:04.569
Switch back to magenta.

00:01:04.569 --> 00:01:07.110
Draw an arrow there.

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:14.450
So this was 10 meters per second
at a 45 degree angle.

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:17.690
We figured out in the last
video that its horizontal

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:23.930
velocity is equal to
10 cosine of 45.

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:28.260
Which equals 5 square
root of 2.

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:32.960
And we also figured out that the
vertical velocity is equal

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:39.300
to 10 sine of 45 degrees.

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:43.200
Which also equals 5
square root of 2.

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:44.910
And we wanted to figure out, how
long does this thing stay

00:01:44.910 --> 00:01:45.780
in the air?

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:48.840
And we said, well, if we're
going-- the vertical component

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:52.020
is 5 square root of 2
meters per second.

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:55.000
So if I'm going 5 square root
of 2 meters per second, the

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.910
ball-- how long does it take for
the ball to go from that

00:01:57.910 --> 00:01:59.820
point to the point that
it's stationary at

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:01.070
the top of its path?

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:08.030
It's going at 5 square root
of 2 meters per second.

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:10.590
And then it goes to 0.

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:12.905
So how long does it take to
decelerate from 5 square

00:02:12.905 --> 00:02:14.480
root of 2 to 0?

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:16.630
And there we just said, you
know, change in velocity.

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:19.930
Well my change in velocity is
minus 5 square root of 2.

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:23.600
That equals acceleration, which
is minus 10 meters per

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:25.710
second squared times time.

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:29.530
We figured out the time when the
ball leaves to kind of its

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:36.265
highest point is the square
root of 2 seconds.

00:02:36.265 --> 00:02:39.680
And that happens if you just
solve this equation.

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:42.510
And that's how long the ball
takes to go from the ground to

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:43.390
its highest point.

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:46.350
And it's going to take the exact
amount of time for it to

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:49.500
reaccelerate and
come back down.

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:52.715
So it takes square root of 2
seconds to go up, it's going

00:02:52.715 --> 00:02:54.740
to take square root of
2 seconds to go down.

00:02:54.740 --> 00:03:03.760
So the total time is equal
to 2 square root of 2.

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:05.280
This is the total time.

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:07.980
This is kind of a nice
intermediate thing that we've

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:09.620
discovered.

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:11.630
Now, can we use this to
figure out how far

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:13.340
does that ball travel?

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:15.760
How far is this sucker
going to go?

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:18.670
Well, the entire time that--
you know, we were messing

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:21.895
around with the vertical speed
or the vertical velocity of

00:03:21.895 --> 00:03:22.760
this ball and the vertical

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:24.000
acceleration, vertical position.

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:27.040
The whole time the ball was
going up and down, it was also

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:32.570
going to the right because it
has this horizontal velocity.

00:03:32.570 --> 00:03:34.410
And we're going to assume
that the horizontal

00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:35.860
velocity stays constant.

00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:37.010
And why can we assume that?

00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:39.010
Well one, we're assuming that
there's no air resistance.

00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:41.040
Because air resistance makes
very-- things very

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:41.580
complicated.

00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:44.370
If this is something like a
penny or a marble, it actually

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:45.840
does have very little
air resistance.

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:48.570
So air isn't going
to slow it down.

00:03:48.570 --> 00:03:52.710
And so if there's no air, what
can slow it down in the

00:03:52.710 --> 00:03:54.220
horizontal direction?

00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:55.180
Well, nothing.

00:03:55.180 --> 00:03:57.020
Gravity only acts downwards.

00:03:57.020 --> 00:04:00.740
Gravity doesn't make something
slow down as it moves

00:04:00.740 --> 00:04:01.660
horizontally.

00:04:01.660 --> 00:04:03.840
You could imagine pushing
something on ice.

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:06.430
And if there's nothing slowing
it down, no friction, no air

00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:08.340
resistance, it'll just
keep on going.

00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:10.550
And actually, the assumptions
we're making would be

00:04:10.550 --> 00:04:12.110
absolutely true on the moon.

00:04:12.110 --> 00:04:13.630
Because the moon has no air.

00:04:13.630 --> 00:04:17.380
But anyway, so the whole time
the ball's going up and down

00:04:17.380 --> 00:04:20.155
it's also moving to the right
at this speed, at 5 square

00:04:20.155 --> 00:04:24.370
root of 2 meters per second.

00:04:24.370 --> 00:04:26.770
And let me ask you a question:
how long is it going to be

00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:28.350
moving to the right?

00:04:28.350 --> 00:04:31.300
Well, it's going to be moving
to the right as long as it's

00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:32.500
up in the air.

00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:34.570
And do we know how long it's
going to be up in the air?

00:04:34.570 --> 00:04:36.270
Well yeah, we just
figured that out.

00:04:36.270 --> 00:04:38.650
We figured out that it stays in
the air for 2 square root

00:04:38.650 --> 00:04:42.250
of 2 seconds.

00:04:42.250 --> 00:04:44.770
So to figure out its horizontal
distance, to figure

00:04:44.770 --> 00:04:48.110
out how long it is along the
ground, so we could say change

00:04:48.110 --> 00:04:49.360
in distance horizontally.

00:04:54.830 --> 00:04:58.040
That just equals my average
velocity, which is just this

00:04:58.040 --> 00:04:59.980
because it doesn't
really change.

00:04:59.980 --> 00:05:04.260
So it equals 5 square root
of 2 meters per second.

00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:06.690
Times the time that
I'm in the air.

00:05:06.690 --> 00:05:08.850
Times 2 square root
of 2 seconds.

00:05:08.850 --> 00:05:10.340
Times this sucker.

00:05:10.340 --> 00:05:12.900
2 square root of 2 seconds.

00:05:12.900 --> 00:05:17.450
So when you multiply
it out-- let's see.

00:05:17.450 --> 00:05:20.515
10 times-- square root of
2 times square root of

00:05:20.515 --> 00:05:22.820
2 is 2 times 2.

00:05:22.820 --> 00:05:29.420
So we go 20 meters.

00:05:29.420 --> 00:05:31.640
That I think is pretty cool.

00:05:31.640 --> 00:05:34.450
All I did is I said well I'm
throwing something at 10

00:05:34.450 --> 00:05:37.010
meters per second at
a 45 degree angle,

00:05:37.010 --> 00:05:37.930
how far did it go?

00:05:37.930 --> 00:05:39.860
And you could figure it out.

00:05:39.860 --> 00:05:43.180
You could figure out that
it went 20 meters.

00:05:43.180 --> 00:05:45.310
And actually, you could do
things the other way.

00:05:45.310 --> 00:05:47.570
And I'll do that in future
problems. You can figure out

00:05:47.570 --> 00:05:51.690
the exact angle you need to
throw something or you need to

00:05:51.690 --> 00:05:55.630
shoot something, if we were
thinking military terms. If

00:05:55.630 --> 00:05:58.070
you were an artillery man and
you had to arm the-- you had

00:05:58.070 --> 00:06:01.550
to figure out what angle to
shoot the big gun at to shoot

00:06:01.550 --> 00:06:03.580
a target-- I don't know, 5
miles away-- not that I

00:06:03.580 --> 00:06:05.900
advocate these type of things--
war is very bad.

00:06:05.900 --> 00:06:07.860
You would be doing essentially
this problem.

00:06:07.860 --> 00:06:09.810
I don't know if people
in the military are

00:06:09.810 --> 00:06:10.470
actually doing it.

00:06:10.470 --> 00:06:12.340
They're probably having a
computer do it for them.

00:06:12.340 --> 00:06:14.310
But it's really not
that hard to do.

00:06:14.310 --> 00:06:16.850
And you know, if we ever lose
our computers and we have to

00:06:16.850 --> 00:06:18.950
do things with bows and arrows,
it's good to be able

00:06:18.950 --> 00:06:22.020
to sit down and do the
math like this.

00:06:22.020 --> 00:06:24.400
So that's all I'm going to do
for-- well, we could do a

00:06:24.400 --> 00:06:25.280
couple of other things too.

00:06:25.280 --> 00:06:27.150
We can also figure out how
high the ball went.

00:06:27.150 --> 00:06:29.920
And how high the ball went is
actually no different than the

00:06:29.920 --> 00:06:32.020
1-dimensional problem.

00:06:32.020 --> 00:06:34.370
We know that this is the
initial velocity

00:06:34.370 --> 00:06:36.050
in its upward direction.

00:06:36.050 --> 00:06:37.790
We know it goes to 0.

00:06:37.790 --> 00:06:40.810
So its average velocity in
the upward direction

00:06:40.810 --> 00:06:41.870
is going to be what?

00:06:41.870 --> 00:06:44.310
Its average velocity in the
upward direction is going to

00:06:44.310 --> 00:06:47.910
be this plus this
divided by 2.

00:06:47.910 --> 00:06:52.480
So the average horizontal
velocity--

00:06:52.480 --> 00:06:54.030
vertical velocity, sorry.

00:06:54.030 --> 00:06:57.090
Vertical velocity average.

00:06:57.090 --> 00:06:58.870
This is funny notation.

00:06:58.870 --> 00:07:00.030
Is just going to be
half of this.

00:07:00.030 --> 00:07:04.000
It's going to be 5 square
root of 2 over 2.

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:07.230
And it travels that
for how long?

00:07:07.230 --> 00:07:09.420
Well just while it's going up,
it travels that for a square

00:07:09.420 --> 00:07:11.755
root of 2 seconds times the
square root of 2 seconds.

00:07:16.050 --> 00:07:18.660
Distance is the average
velocity times time.

00:07:18.660 --> 00:07:19.750
So this is a sequel.

00:07:19.750 --> 00:07:23.060
This square root of 2 times this
square root of 2 is 2,

00:07:23.060 --> 00:07:24.350
and it cancels out with this.

00:07:24.350 --> 00:07:29.290
So the peak height that we could
say, the height is going

00:07:29.290 --> 00:07:31.390
to be 5 meters.

00:07:31.390 --> 00:07:32.360
So that's pretty neat.

00:07:32.360 --> 00:07:35.500
If I throw something at 10
meters per second at a 45

00:07:35.500 --> 00:07:38.730
degree angle, its maximum height
is going to be 5 meters

00:07:38.730 --> 00:07:40.550
and it's going to
go 20 meters.

00:07:40.550 --> 00:07:43.050
So I could draw that.

00:07:43.050 --> 00:07:46.110
Image, clear image.

00:07:46.110 --> 00:07:48.750
Image, invert colors.

00:07:48.750 --> 00:07:52.310
So let me draw my ground.

00:07:52.310 --> 00:07:54.096
Oh, whoops.

00:07:54.096 --> 00:07:57.420
So I'm going to draw my ground,
it's kind of a yellow

00:07:57.420 --> 00:07:58.820
ochre ground.

00:07:58.820 --> 00:08:09.790
And I'm going to shoot something
at an angle of 45

00:08:09.790 --> 00:08:15.960
degrees at 10 meters
per second.

00:08:15.960 --> 00:08:22.600
And we figured out that it
will go 20 meters and its

00:08:22.600 --> 00:08:25.630
maximum height is going
to be-- let's see.

00:08:25.630 --> 00:08:27.400
This is 10, so I'm
trying to draw

00:08:27.400 --> 00:08:28.620
something kind of to scale.

00:08:28.620 --> 00:08:31.680
So its maximum height
is roughly 5 meters.

00:08:31.680 --> 00:08:33.010
It is exactly 5 meters.

00:08:33.010 --> 00:08:34.400
Roughly is what I'm drawing.

00:08:34.400 --> 00:08:37.789
And so its path is going to
look something like this.

00:08:37.789 --> 00:08:39.799
You know, right from the get-go
it's at that angle, but

00:08:39.799 --> 00:08:41.650
the angle is going to get
shallower and shallower.

00:08:44.360 --> 00:08:46.530
Then it gets to 5 meters
and it comes down.

00:08:46.530 --> 00:08:50.270
And then it hits the ground.

00:08:50.270 --> 00:08:50.800
So there you go.

00:08:50.800 --> 00:08:53.090
We just figured out how far
does that thing go and how

00:08:53.090 --> 00:08:53.590
high does it go.

00:08:53.590 --> 00:08:55.290
What else could you want?

00:08:55.290 --> 00:08:58.020
So in the next video I'm going
to do this more generally, so

00:08:58.020 --> 00:09:00.610
that we can kind of-- we
can work backwards.

00:09:00.610 --> 00:09:03.846
If we know how far something
went and how long it was in

00:09:03.846 --> 00:09:05.440
the air, maybe we could
figure out its angle.

00:09:05.440 --> 00:09:07.640
Or maybe we could actually
figure out what the optimal

00:09:07.640 --> 00:09:10.240
angle is to throw something
for distance.

00:09:10.240 --> 00:09:12.410
I'll see you in the
next video.
