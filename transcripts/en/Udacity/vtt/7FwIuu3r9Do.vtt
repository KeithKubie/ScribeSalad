00:00:00.800 --> 00:00:03.990
It's time for you to start
working on your own weather app.

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:06.120
We've given you a bit
of a head start and

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:11.500
created the basic app shell, styles,
and initial JavaScript for you.

00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:15.620
See the instructor notes below for
information on how to download and

00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:18.130
get your development environment set up.

00:00:18.130 --> 00:00:21.250
Because we'll be working with
a service worker in a bit and

00:00:21.250 --> 00:00:24.780
service workers do not work when
served from the file system.

00:00:24.780 --> 00:00:27.935
Make sure that you're working
from a local web server

00:00:27.935 --> 00:00:29.920
in your development environment.

00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:32.810
See the instructor notes for
some more ways to do this.

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:37.820
Service workers must
be served over HTTPS.

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:39.531
But to make development easier,

00:00:39.531 --> 00:00:42.960
that requirement is waived when
they're served from local host.

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:46.010
When you've got everything
setup properly,

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:48.030
your app should look like this.

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:52.240
Be sure to compare your app in
the link to the instructor notes below

00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:54.670
to make sure everything
works exactly the same.
