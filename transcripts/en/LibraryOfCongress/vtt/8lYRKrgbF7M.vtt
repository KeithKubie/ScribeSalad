00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:12.620
&gt;&gt; John Haskell: At the
Kluge Center and we're glad

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:15.250
to have you here
[inaudible] members' room here

00:00:15.250 --> 00:00:17.490
in the Jefferson Building.

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:24.420
Some of you may not know too
much about the Kluge Center,

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:28.380
but the Kluge Center was founded
in 2000 and its mission is

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:29.680
to bridge the gap
between scholarship

00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:30.980
on the hand and congress,

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:33.870
other policymakers, and the
interest of public on the other

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:35.170
to contribute to the debate

00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:37.650
about the challenges facing
democracies in the 21st century.

00:00:37.650 --> 00:00:42.960
We do that in a variety of ways,
including events like this.

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:47.040
And let me just outline what
we're going to do today.

00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:49.340
There will be a book
signing afterwards.

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:52.400
I hope you will stay around
for the reception as well.

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:56.090
And, basically, I'm going to
pitch some questions at John

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:58.980
and see what he has to say
about for 40 minutes or so,

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:00.830
and then we'll turn
to your questions.

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:02.130
&gt;&gt; Jonathan Haidt: Okay,

00:01:02.130 --> 00:01:06.700
how about before [inaudible] I
just make a general statement.

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:08.000
So, hello, everyone.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:09.300
I'm John Haidt.

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:11.680
I'm a professor at NYU Stern.

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:14.370
And we'll be talking about,
in part about my book,

00:01:14.370 --> 00:01:16.370
The Coddling of the
American Mind.

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:18.220
But a lot of my research
is, we'll be talking

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:21.360
about some things that could
offend you or drive you crazy

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:23.130
if you're in that
normal reactive mode,

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:24.430
but I hope this beautiful
setting,

00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:27.540
this library, will put
us all in the mode like,

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:28.840
we've got problems,
let's think about them,

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:30.740
let's talk about them, and
that's what we're here to do.

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:32.070
&gt;&gt; John Haskell:
Yeah, you know, John,

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:34.310
mentioned that he got
his bachelor's degree,

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:37.930
it was in philosophy at Yale,
a Ph.D. It was in psychology

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:40.450
at the University
of Pennsylvania.

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:43.930
And he went on to teach for 16
years at UVA before he ended

00:01:43.930 --> 00:01:46.980
up at the Stern School
of Business and the chair

00:01:46.980 --> 00:01:49.530
for ethical leadership at NYU.

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:54.610
I want to particularly emphasize
an earlier book he wrote,

00:01:54.610 --> 00:01:56.330
because we're going to
build a question on that.

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:58.240
The first question I
have is built on that.

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:02.740
It's, I think I would say,
his most acclaimed book.

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:04.450
That still remains to be seen.

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:06.540
Let's see what happens with
the -- with the new book,

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:08.270
The Coddling of the
American Mind.

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:09.640
But it was a New York
Times bestseller.

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:12.590
It's called The Righteous Mind,
Why Good People Are Divided

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:14.070
by Politics and Religion.

00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:15.370
I think if you want

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:16.720
to understand our political
divisions, in my opinion,

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:19.240
it's the single book
you should read.

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:21.340
In that book he offers
an account of the origins

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:24.350
of the human moral sense
and he shows how variations

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:27.760
in moral intuitions can help
explain the polarization

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:31.030
and what some might call
dysfunction of our politics.

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:34.160
So, a good place to start,
particularly here in Washington

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:36.570
for this particular
audience, is with that book.

00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:39.400
Can you tell us about your
research related to the book

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:42.340
and how you got from
The Righteous Mind

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:43.660
to the coddled mind?

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:44.960
&gt;&gt; Jonathan Haidt:
Coddled mind, right.

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:46.260
&gt;&gt; John Haskell: And the
new book is The Coddling

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:47.560
of the American Mind.

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:48.860
&gt;&gt; Jonathan Haidt: Sure.

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:50.160
So, I study morality.

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:51.610
That's what I've done
since graduate school,

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:53.960
and I look at it both from
an evolutionary perspective

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:56.310
and cultural psychological,
or anthropological,

00:02:56.310 --> 00:02:58.330
perspective at the same time.

00:02:58.330 --> 00:03:02.180
And I was looking at how
cultures vary around the world

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:04.320
and why there are a lot of
similarities and differences.

00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:06.240
And in the 1990's
I began to notice

00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:09.380
that the American culture was
heating up to such an extent

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:11.980
that left and right were
like different countries,

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:13.500
like different cultures.

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:15.700
We have different
American history.

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:17.230
If you ask, what's
American history on the left

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:19.170
and the right, it's like
different countries.

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:20.690
If you ask, what's
the U.S. Constitution,

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:22.180
two different Constitutions.

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:24.310
You ask about climate science,
if you ask about so many things,

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:25.760
we're coming apart --
we were coming apart,

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:29.160
and that was in the 90's.

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:31.540
So, I began studying about, and
originally I was on the left.

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:33.350
I was always on the
left when I was younger,

00:03:33.350 --> 00:03:37.240
and I began really studying
political psychology in order

00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:39.420
to help the Democrats
win, because after 2000

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:42.910
and 2004 I thought, they have no
clue how to talk about morality.

00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:45.460
I'd like to help them connect
with American morality.

00:03:45.460 --> 00:03:48.880
So, I set out to understand the
conservatives read conservative

00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:51.000
writings and watch
conservative TV shows,

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:52.950
and what I discovered was

00:03:52.950 --> 00:03:55.610
that on any complicated issue
you want to think about,

00:03:55.610 --> 00:03:57.170
if you're not -- if
you're only looking

00:03:57.170 --> 00:03:59.110
at one perspective you can't
possibly understand it.

00:03:59.110 --> 00:04:02.660
And I found it was so much
fun and so interesting to look

00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:04.350
at things from a
conservative perspective

00:04:04.350 --> 00:04:06.390
and libertarian perspective.

00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:08.530
And so, eventually, I just sort
of stepped out and I said, okay,

00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:10.220
I'm not on any team anymore.

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:12.340
And I think to be a social
scientist it's very helpful

00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:13.640
to not be on a team.

00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:15.620
It's really corrupting
to be on a team

00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:18.680
and to want certain results
to come out of your research.

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:21.550
So, I was working on the problem

00:04:21.550 --> 00:04:23.140
of political polarization
for a long time.

00:04:23.140 --> 00:04:24.440
I wrote the book
The Righteous Mind.

00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:26.200
It came out in 2012 and then
things kept getting worse

00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:27.830
and worse.

00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:30.370
But the basic perspective
that we are tribal creatures,

00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:34.020
we evolved for tribal conflict,
we're very good at doing us

00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:36.220
versus them, and
this is the nature --

00:04:36.220 --> 00:04:38.000
this allows us to do sports.

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:39.550
This allows us to do politics.

00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:41.590
It's all the same psychology.

00:04:41.590 --> 00:04:43.220
So, while I'm working
on this problem,

00:04:43.220 --> 00:04:45.240
suddenly these strange
things start happening

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:48.130
in my backyard, namely
universities.

00:04:48.130 --> 00:04:51.680
Beginning in 2014 we started
seeing students asking

00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:54.750
for trigger warnings, protesting
speakers on the grounds

00:04:54.750 --> 00:04:57.480
that if this speaker comes to
campus it will be traumatizing

00:04:57.480 --> 00:04:59.670
or damaging to some students.

00:04:59.670 --> 00:05:00.970
You know, you might say, well,

00:05:00.970 --> 00:05:02.270
why don't you just say
not go to the talk?

00:05:02.270 --> 00:05:03.570
But, no. They would say, no, no,

00:05:03.570 --> 00:05:06.130
we can't have this person
step foot on our campus.

00:05:06.130 --> 00:05:07.990
So, it was a new
morality, a new fearfulness

00:05:07.990 --> 00:05:09.600
about words and ideas.

00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:11.990
So, Greg Lukianoff
and I wrote this book.

00:05:11.990 --> 00:05:14.330
Greg Lukianoff came to me, he's
the president of the Foundation

00:05:14.330 --> 00:05:16.740
for Individual Rights in
Education, he came to me

00:05:16.740 --> 00:05:20.650
with this idea that somehow
students were learning

00:05:20.650 --> 00:05:22.230
to interpret words and books

00:05:22.230 --> 00:05:26.150
and ideas using the exact
same cognitive distortions

00:05:26.150 --> 00:05:28.220
that he had learned not to do

00:05:28.220 --> 00:05:30.880
when he learned cognitive
behavioral therapy.

00:05:30.880 --> 00:05:34.200
He had a suicidal
depression in 2007.

00:05:34.200 --> 00:05:36.870
He thinks cognitive
therapy saved his life.

00:05:36.870 --> 00:05:39.380
You learn all these distortions,
black-and-white thinking,

00:05:39.380 --> 00:05:42.680
catastrophizing, mind-reading,
labeling, all these things

00:05:42.680 --> 00:05:44.560
that people sometimes
do, but depressed

00:05:44.560 --> 00:05:46.910
and anxious people
do constantly.

00:05:46.910 --> 00:05:48.210
And, so, the therapist,
you stop --

00:05:48.210 --> 00:05:49.510
you learn how to
stop doing that.

00:05:49.510 --> 00:05:51.910
And Greg noticed students
are beginning to really do

00:05:51.910 --> 00:05:54.720
that a lot, catastrophizing,
everything is good or evil.

00:05:54.720 --> 00:05:57.470
Around 2014 we wrote an
article in The Atlantic,

00:05:57.470 --> 00:05:59.880
it comes out in 2015,
and we think we're done,

00:05:59.880 --> 00:06:03.080
we did our analysis
of these trends.

00:06:03.080 --> 00:06:05.570
And then, at Halloween of
2015, some of you know,

00:06:05.570 --> 00:06:08.240
some of you don't, but at
Halloween of 2015 at Yale,

00:06:08.240 --> 00:06:10.520
and then it went everywhere,
it went many other places,

00:06:10.520 --> 00:06:12.070
there were giant protests.

00:06:12.070 --> 00:06:14.900
It like a new moral culture
had emerged on some campuses,

00:06:14.900 --> 00:06:16.850
and it's a real puzzle, and
it's a very difficult one

00:06:16.850 --> 00:06:21.300
to work with, as we'll to,
but it's a callout culture.

00:06:21.300 --> 00:06:23.500
It makes it very difficult
for people to work together.

00:06:23.500 --> 00:06:25.410
So, that's how we
got from my work

00:06:25.410 --> 00:06:27.810
on originally cultural
differences

00:06:27.810 --> 00:06:30.380
to political differences
and the culture war

00:06:30.380 --> 00:06:32.210
to what's going on campus.

00:06:32.210 --> 00:06:34.860
And I think during our
discussion we'll come then off

00:06:34.860 --> 00:06:36.290
of campus back to politics.

00:06:36.290 --> 00:06:39.600
&gt;&gt; John Haskell: Yeah, we'll get
-- but sticking with campus is,

00:06:39.600 --> 00:06:43.120
go into more detail about what
you identify as the issues

00:06:43.120 --> 00:06:46.980
on campus and, in particular,

00:06:46.980 --> 00:06:49.630
maybe a couple of
specific examples.

00:06:49.630 --> 00:06:52.640
I mean, some of them have gotten
a lot of press nationally.

00:06:52.640 --> 00:06:55.450
You know, when I was
reading your book I noticed

00:06:55.450 --> 00:06:57.720
that you also brought in
examples that I hadn't heard

00:06:57.720 --> 00:07:00.960
of before that were --
that were illuminating.

00:07:00.960 --> 00:07:02.260
So, I'll --

00:07:02.260 --> 00:07:03.560
&gt;&gt; Jonathan Haidt: Sure,
so, let me first check.

00:07:03.560 --> 00:07:06.770
How many of you, if I just
ask you about the protests

00:07:06.770 --> 00:07:09.710
at Berkeley when Milo
Yiannopoulos was scheduled

00:07:09.710 --> 00:07:11.010
to speak?

00:07:11.010 --> 00:07:12.310
Raise your hand if
you know what that is,

00:07:12.310 --> 00:07:13.610
if you heard about that?

00:07:13.610 --> 00:07:15.900
Okay, most, but not all of
you, the great majority of you.

00:07:15.900 --> 00:07:17.200
Or, the protests at Yale

00:07:17.200 --> 00:07:19.700
when Nicholas Christakis
was surrounded by students

00:07:19.700 --> 00:07:21.680
who demanded he apologize,
raise your hand

00:07:21.680 --> 00:07:23.510
if you know what that is?

00:07:23.510 --> 00:07:24.990
Okay, there's less than half.

00:07:24.990 --> 00:07:26.480
All right, so there are these --

00:07:26.480 --> 00:07:30.950
the most spectacular events are
mobbing where students circle

00:07:30.950 --> 00:07:34.170
around a professor, a speaker,
and they demand that he be fired

00:07:34.170 --> 00:07:36.240
or he retract something.

00:07:36.240 --> 00:07:37.540
Speaker shutdowns

00:07:37.540 --> 00:07:39.710
where typically a conservative
speaker is invited to campus

00:07:39.710 --> 00:07:42.130
and the students demand
that he be disinvited.

00:07:42.130 --> 00:07:44.130
And if the president

00:07:44.130 --> 00:07:46.350
of the university
won't disinvited them,

00:07:46.350 --> 00:07:47.790
then they protest.

00:07:47.790 --> 00:07:49.810
They try to block people
from coming in, or they go

00:07:49.810 --> 00:07:51.500
and they try to shout him down.

00:07:51.500 --> 00:07:52.800
So, these things happen.

00:07:52.800 --> 00:07:54.310
There were some of
these in the 60's,

00:07:54.310 --> 00:07:56.930
but that didn't happen
for a long time.

00:07:56.930 --> 00:07:58.310
And then there's a lot now.

00:07:58.310 --> 00:07:59.800
By a lot I mean a few dozen.

00:07:59.800 --> 00:08:01.210
It's not happening
at every school,

00:08:01.210 --> 00:08:02.790
but there are dozens of these.

00:08:02.790 --> 00:08:04.090
These are always videotaped.

00:08:04.090 --> 00:08:05.500
Everybody pulls out
their cellphone and, so,

00:08:05.500 --> 00:08:06.800
they're on the Internet,

00:08:06.800 --> 00:08:08.630
and especially right-wing
media sites love them

00:08:08.630 --> 00:08:11.280
because they really show
students being intolerant

00:08:11.280 --> 00:08:13.800
of conservative ideas
and speakers.

00:08:13.800 --> 00:08:15.320
Those are the most
spectacular things,

00:08:15.320 --> 00:08:17.100
but those are fairly rare.

00:08:17.100 --> 00:08:18.670
What I'd rather talk
about with you,

00:08:18.670 --> 00:08:21.890
or what you may not know about,
is the really subtle ways

00:08:21.890 --> 00:08:24.590
that the speech climate
on campus has changed,

00:08:24.590 --> 00:08:26.950
and this is very
widespread and very damaging.

00:08:26.950 --> 00:08:28.540
So, I'll just share with
you a couple of examples,

00:08:28.540 --> 00:08:30.110
because now people --
you know, people write

00:08:30.110 --> 00:08:31.570
to me all the time now
with these examples.

00:08:31.570 --> 00:08:36.510
And so one -- so, I co-run a
group called Heterodox Academy,

00:08:36.510 --> 00:08:39.360
and the woman who now
runs it was a professor

00:08:39.360 --> 00:08:40.660
at Harvey Mudd College,

00:08:40.660 --> 00:08:42.670
at one of the Claremont
colleges in California.

00:08:42.670 --> 00:08:47.060
And she uses the example of how
a student came to talk to her --

00:08:47.060 --> 00:08:51.220
well, a student came to talk
to her and he started to say,

00:08:51.220 --> 00:08:53.940
you know, yeah, that's
a great idea,

00:08:53.940 --> 00:08:56.280
because that would
kill two birds with,

00:08:56.280 --> 00:08:59.340
and he covered his mouth.

00:08:59.340 --> 00:09:00.640
And she said, what?

00:09:00.640 --> 00:09:01.940
Were you going to say,
two birds with one stone?

00:09:01.940 --> 00:09:05.510
And he said, well, yes,
but that would be violent.

00:09:05.510 --> 00:09:06.810
And he was afraid,
because if you say --

00:09:06.810 --> 00:09:08.110
like, he could be called out,

00:09:08.110 --> 00:09:10.780
like he could be
shamed for saying that.

00:09:10.780 --> 00:09:13.560
There's another story from
another college in California.

00:09:13.560 --> 00:09:15.910
Three students, this was
e-mailed to me by a friend,

00:09:15.910 --> 00:09:19.190
her daughter and two other
people were walking on campus

00:09:19.190 --> 00:09:21.310
and her daughter said,
wow, I'm starving,

00:09:21.310 --> 00:09:24.750
and her friends called
her out on that.

00:09:24.750 --> 00:09:27.090
That's insensitive,
because there are people

00:09:27.090 --> 00:09:28.390
who are really starting.

00:09:28.390 --> 00:09:31.620
So, those are just two
examples from college.

00:09:31.620 --> 00:09:34.400
But this sort of thing is
happening all the time, that is,

00:09:34.400 --> 00:09:37.650
students get prestige by showing
that they are more sensitive

00:09:37.650 --> 00:09:40.030
to various victim groups
or marginalized groups.

00:09:40.030 --> 00:09:43.330
They get prestige by calling
out someone for insensitivity.

00:09:43.330 --> 00:09:44.850
Now, most students
are perfectly normal

00:09:44.850 --> 00:09:46.290
and sane are not doing this,

00:09:46.290 --> 00:09:48.310
but in any group there
are some who are.

00:09:48.310 --> 00:09:50.240
And, so, if you can imagine
what it's like to be a student

00:09:50.240 --> 00:09:52.340
where you never know when you're
going to be publicly shamed.

00:09:52.340 --> 00:09:54.300
And, of course, someone
could not tell you

00:09:54.300 --> 00:09:56.590
that you're being shamed,
they just go and they put it

00:09:56.590 --> 00:10:00.710
on social media, and now
your reputation is destroyed.

00:10:00.710 --> 00:10:02.820
This sort of thing happens
at universities all the time.

00:10:02.820 --> 00:10:04.680
Now, it's creeping out
into the workplace.

00:10:04.680 --> 00:10:06.860
So, this is not just on campus.

00:10:06.860 --> 00:10:10.320
So, a woman who runs an
organization on business ethics

00:10:10.320 --> 00:10:12.720
that I -- that I
cofounded, she said a friend

00:10:12.720 --> 00:10:14.720
of hers was just reported to HR.

00:10:14.720 --> 00:10:17.060
Why? Because she was
on a conference call,

00:10:17.060 --> 00:10:19.220
and after the conference call
the person they were talking

00:10:19.220 --> 00:10:22.490
to had been speaking so quickly
she said, wow, that guy sounded

00:10:22.490 --> 00:10:25.180
like he was on Ritalin, and
a few days later she's called

00:10:25.180 --> 00:10:28.240
into HR because that
was insensitive,

00:10:28.240 --> 00:10:31.420
insensitive to people
who have ADHD.

00:10:31.420 --> 00:10:34.830
Now, again, you can -- you can
discuss whether we should talk

00:10:34.830 --> 00:10:38.810
about this, but this is the
pattern, is you report someone.

00:10:38.810 --> 00:10:40.890
You don't -- you don't tend
to resolve it directly.

00:10:40.890 --> 00:10:42.190
You report someone.

00:10:42.190 --> 00:10:44.300
And, so, here's a review
of my book on Amazon.

00:10:44.300 --> 00:10:47.050
Quote, I couldn't
understand why my new, bright,

00:10:47.050 --> 00:10:48.960
young workers kept running to HR

00:10:48.960 --> 00:10:53.140
for every little interpersonal
problem and why they refused

00:10:53.140 --> 00:10:54.880
to show up to meetings
with the person

00:10:54.880 --> 00:10:57.830
who they thought offended them,
because it's very threatening.

00:10:57.830 --> 00:11:00.420
If someone tells a joke
and you're offended,

00:11:00.420 --> 00:11:02.620
and you report them to
HR for having told a joke

00:11:02.620 --> 00:11:05.320
to someone else, not even to
you, just you overheard it,

00:11:05.320 --> 00:11:09.810
you're offended, it
would very frightening

00:11:09.810 --> 00:11:11.910
and traumatizing
even, to have to be

00:11:11.910 --> 00:11:13.470
in a room with that person.

00:11:13.470 --> 00:11:14.890
So, you just want
to report it to HR,

00:11:14.890 --> 00:11:17.430
have them punish the person,
and leave you out of it.

00:11:17.430 --> 00:11:18.870
Now, imagine what it
would be like to work

00:11:18.870 --> 00:11:20.590
with people like this.

00:11:20.590 --> 00:11:23.750
Again, most students,
most students are fine,

00:11:23.750 --> 00:11:25.780
but some have adopted
this new morality.

00:11:25.780 --> 00:11:28.590
Let me make clear, this
is not the millennials.

00:11:28.590 --> 00:11:30.110
Millennials are okay.

00:11:30.110 --> 00:11:32.010
This is the generation
after millennials.

00:11:32.010 --> 00:11:35.540
You see this in students
born in 1995 and after.

00:11:35.540 --> 00:11:37.080
So, that's the phenomena
we're talking about.

00:11:37.080 --> 00:11:38.380
&gt;&gt; John Haskell: You know,
and that one hits you

00:11:38.380 --> 00:11:39.990
with a [inaudible], because you
mentioned something a couple

00:11:39.990 --> 00:11:42.320
minutes ago about how
you saw this happening.

00:11:42.320 --> 00:11:43.940
This is all over the
book, where, hey,

00:11:43.940 --> 00:11:45.240
there's this dividing line.

00:11:45.240 --> 00:11:47.600
And, you know, it's
not a bright line.

00:11:47.600 --> 00:11:48.900
&gt;&gt; Jonathan Haidt:
It's pretty bright.

00:11:48.900 --> 00:11:50.200
&gt;&gt; John Haskell: Okay,
then it is a bright line.

00:11:50.200 --> 00:11:51.500
&gt;&gt; Jonathan Haidt:
It's a bright line.

00:11:51.500 --> 00:11:52.800
It's amazingly bright.

00:11:52.800 --> 00:11:54.100
&gt;&gt; John Haskell: In 2014.

00:11:54.100 --> 00:11:55.400
&gt;&gt; Jonathan Haidt: Yeah.

00:11:55.400 --> 00:11:56.700
&gt;&gt; John Haskell: I'm going
to hit you with a series

00:11:56.700 --> 00:11:58.000
of questions about that.

00:11:58.000 --> 00:11:59.300
&gt;&gt; Jonathan Haidt: Okay.

00:11:59.300 --> 00:12:00.600
&gt;&gt; John Haskell: And
you can come back at me

00:12:00.600 --> 00:12:01.900
if you don't remember them all.

00:12:01.900 --> 00:12:03.200
You know, maybe you'll
have mnemonic device to --

00:12:03.200 --> 00:12:04.500
&gt;&gt; Jonathan Haidt: Okay.

00:12:04.500 --> 00:12:05.800
&gt;&gt; John Haskell: But, so, why --

00:12:05.800 --> 00:12:07.100
what's this dividing
line about in 2014?

00:12:07.100 --> 00:12:08.420
Why is it 2014?

00:12:08.420 --> 00:12:10.040
Was it something in 2014?

00:12:10.040 --> 00:12:12.550
Are the roots further back?

00:12:12.550 --> 00:12:14.470
Is it worse at some
types of colleges

00:12:14.470 --> 00:12:16.450
and universities than others?

00:12:16.450 --> 00:12:19.940
And I noted that you went
into great detail in the book,

00:12:19.940 --> 00:12:23.260
in what might be as fascinating
a part of it as anything,

00:12:23.260 --> 00:12:28.020
about how it's worse for
women, girls and then women,

00:12:28.020 --> 00:12:30.840
than it is for boys and then
men, which is quite interesting.

00:12:30.840 --> 00:12:32.140
So, maybe you can go
into some of the --

00:12:32.140 --> 00:12:33.440
&gt;&gt; Jonathan Haidt: Sure.

00:12:33.440 --> 00:12:36.880
So, here's the -- so, there
are only two places in history,

00:12:36.880 --> 00:12:40.020
in modern history, where
there's a clear dividing line.

00:12:40.020 --> 00:12:41.560
So, in 1946 is one.

00:12:41.560 --> 00:12:44.620
If you were born in 1946
your childhood was different

00:12:44.620 --> 00:12:47.980
than if you were born in 1943,
because there was a, you know,

00:12:47.980 --> 00:12:49.280
everything changed
after the war.

00:12:49.280 --> 00:12:54.220
And, strangely, if you were
born in 1995, or afterwards,

00:12:54.220 --> 00:12:58.040
your child is different than if
you were born in 1992 or before.

00:12:58.040 --> 00:13:02.160
And, so, and the clearest
evidence of that is contained

00:13:02.160 --> 00:13:04.500
in the book iGen by Jean Twenge.

00:13:04.500 --> 00:13:05.890
She goes through all kinds

00:13:05.890 --> 00:13:07.510
of nationally representative
studies

00:13:07.510 --> 00:13:09.590
about behavior of adolescents.

00:13:09.590 --> 00:13:11.950
And what you find is that
beginning with kids born

00:13:11.950 --> 00:13:17.360
around 1994, five,
they go out a lot less.

00:13:17.360 --> 00:13:19.650
They don't -- they're much
less likely to drink alcohol,

00:13:19.650 --> 00:13:21.820
much less likely to go out
on dates, much less likely

00:13:21.820 --> 00:13:24.060
to have ever worked for money.

00:13:24.060 --> 00:13:27.540
They are much more anxious,
much more depressed.

00:13:27.540 --> 00:13:28.840
Their lives changed.

00:13:28.840 --> 00:13:30.140
Their childhood changed.

00:13:30.140 --> 00:13:33.690
Now, why? So, they were
hit with a number of things

00:13:33.690 --> 00:13:36.300
that are different from the
millennials, the most important

00:13:36.300 --> 00:13:40.060
of which is Facebook opens
up in 2006 to the world.

00:13:40.060 --> 00:13:42.880
So, you can be a 13-year-old,
or an 11-year-old who lies,

00:13:42.880 --> 00:13:44.330
you can be a 13-year-old in 2006

00:13:44.330 --> 00:13:47.300
and you can get Facebook,
but very few do.

00:13:47.300 --> 00:13:53.270
In 2007 when these kids are 11
or 12, the iPhone comes out,

00:13:53.270 --> 00:13:55.120
and now you can have
Facebook and social media

00:13:55.120 --> 00:13:57.340
with you all the
time, but very few do.

00:13:57.340 --> 00:13:58.900
It's quite expensive.

00:13:58.900 --> 00:14:02.440
But, gradually, by that
2009, a lot of them do.

00:14:02.440 --> 00:14:06.310
So, there's huge adoption
of social media around 2009,

00:14:06.310 --> 00:14:10.100
2010 by adolescents
in the United States.

00:14:10.100 --> 00:14:13.300
And right at 2011,
2012 the anxiety

00:14:13.300 --> 00:14:16.390
and depression rates start
going steadily upwards,

00:14:16.390 --> 00:14:18.120
especially for girls.

00:14:18.120 --> 00:14:21.600
So, social media is thought
to be the main culprit

00:14:21.600 --> 00:14:25.650
for why things got so
bad after 2011, 2012.

00:14:25.650 --> 00:14:28.420
If you were a millennial and
you got Facebook in college,

00:14:28.420 --> 00:14:30.750
your brain was already
mostly formed.

00:14:30.750 --> 00:14:33.540
But if you're 13 when you
get Facebook, Instagram,

00:14:33.540 --> 00:14:36.680
all those things, the nature
of social relationships is

00:14:36.680 --> 00:14:41.770
so different and so much social
comparison and fear of shame

00:14:41.770 --> 00:14:44.020
that your sociality
is different.

00:14:44.020 --> 00:14:46.280
So, social media is thought
to be the main thing.

00:14:46.280 --> 00:14:51.590
But the other big thing is
the change in whether you got

00:14:51.590 --> 00:14:54.340
to be independent
between ages eight and 12.

00:14:54.340 --> 00:14:55.990
This is turning -- I'm
just discovering this now,

00:14:55.990 --> 00:14:57.620
and let me do [inaudible]
with you.

00:14:57.620 --> 00:14:59.030
So, most of you here are --

00:14:59.030 --> 00:15:01.210
the great majority
of you are over 40.

00:15:01.210 --> 00:15:04.450
What I want to ask you
is, how old were you

00:15:04.450 --> 00:15:08.370
when you were allowed outside on
your own, meaning you could walk

00:15:08.370 --> 00:15:10.830
to a friend's house
three blocks away?

00:15:10.830 --> 00:15:13.080
You could go down to the corner
store and buy a candy bar,

00:15:13.080 --> 00:15:14.890
or go get some milk to
bring home for your --

00:15:14.890 --> 00:15:16.240
you know, for the family?

00:15:16.240 --> 00:15:17.590
How old were?

00:15:17.590 --> 00:15:20.220
Was it first grade, second
grade, third grade, sixth grade?

00:15:20.220 --> 00:15:22.870
You know, how old were you
when you were allowed out?

00:15:22.870 --> 00:15:25.070
First grade is usually
about, you know, six.

00:15:25.070 --> 00:15:27.940
So, fifth grade is
like around age 10.

00:15:27.940 --> 00:15:29.530
Think of your number
and then I'm just going

00:15:29.530 --> 00:15:31.840
to have you call it out.

00:15:31.840 --> 00:15:34.810
Okay, those of you over 40,
just call out the numbers.

00:15:34.810 --> 00:15:36.110
What age?

00:15:36.110 --> 00:15:37.410
&gt;&gt; Seven.

00:15:37.410 --> 00:15:38.710
&gt;&gt; Eight.

00:15:38.710 --> 00:15:40.010
&gt;&gt; Seven.

00:15:40.010 --> 00:15:41.310
&gt;&gt; Jonathan Haidt: Okay,
this is what I always find,

00:15:41.310 --> 00:15:42.610
it's six, seven, or eight.

00:15:42.610 --> 00:15:43.910
This is what it always was,

00:15:43.910 --> 00:15:45.400
and this is what it
is around the world.

00:15:45.400 --> 00:15:47.510
I've studied street
kids all over the world.

00:15:47.510 --> 00:15:49.200
Street kids start
age seven or eight.

00:15:49.200 --> 00:15:51.200
A five-year-old cannot
live out on the street.

00:15:51.200 --> 00:15:54.120
A bunch of eight-year-olds can
run from the cops, steal food,

00:15:54.120 --> 00:15:56.040
and sleep under a bridge, okay?

00:15:56.040 --> 00:15:58.760
And most of you did something
like that, like not that bad,

00:15:58.760 --> 00:16:00.420
but, you know, you
had adventures, okay?

00:16:00.420 --> 00:16:02.580
Now, is there anybody
here under 25?

00:16:02.580 --> 00:16:03.880
I don't think so.

00:16:03.880 --> 00:16:05.180
Anybody under 25?

00:16:05.180 --> 00:16:06.480
Raise your hand.

00:16:06.480 --> 00:16:07.780
&gt;&gt; John Haskell: We got someone.

00:16:07.780 --> 00:16:09.140
&gt;&gt; Jonathan Haidt: Okay, what
age were you allowed out?

00:16:09.140 --> 00:16:11.190
[ Inaudible ]

00:16:11.190 --> 00:16:12.490
Okay. What?

00:16:12.490 --> 00:16:14.210
[ Inaudible ]

00:16:14.210 --> 00:16:16.770
Okay, what I find when I
speak at colleges, it's 12,

00:16:16.770 --> 00:16:19.420
13, 14, sometimes 15, 16.

00:16:19.420 --> 00:16:22.140
Last week I spoke at Case
Western and one woman said six.

00:16:22.140 --> 00:16:23.440
And I said, really?

00:16:23.440 --> 00:16:24.740
Where did you grow up?

00:16:24.740 --> 00:16:26.040
And she said, well, the
Philippines, but when we --

00:16:26.040 --> 00:16:27.340
then we moved here
when I was nine

00:16:27.340 --> 00:16:29.660
and then I wasn't allowed
out until I was 14.

00:16:29.660 --> 00:16:32.090
So, we've done this
giant experiment

00:16:32.090 --> 00:16:34.510
where there's this period
between eight to 12,

00:16:34.510 --> 00:16:37.400
which is the great period
of cultural exploration,

00:16:37.400 --> 00:16:39.660
this is the period that
children's stories are about.

00:16:39.660 --> 00:16:41.960
How many children stories do
you know that are about an eight

00:16:41.960 --> 00:16:44.890
or nine-year-old kid, you
know, or siblings who go off

00:16:44.890 --> 00:16:46.570
on an adventure with
their parents?

00:16:46.570 --> 00:16:47.870
Like, I guess it happens.

00:16:47.870 --> 00:16:49.280
There's like The Swiss
Family Robinson or something.

00:16:49.280 --> 00:16:51.150
But it's almost always
they leave the parents

00:16:51.150 --> 00:16:52.450
and they go off and
have adventures.

00:16:52.450 --> 00:16:53.960
They learn how to
be independent.

00:16:53.960 --> 00:16:57.840
And what we've done, and we did
this in the '90s, this is why,

00:16:57.840 --> 00:16:59.920
this is why you get
the bright line,

00:16:59.920 --> 00:17:02.180
everybody up until the '90s,
including the millennials,

00:17:02.180 --> 00:17:04.660
got the chance to practice
independence before it was too

00:17:04.660 --> 00:17:06.080
late, before the window closed.

00:17:06.080 --> 00:17:08.320
Eight to 14 is a critical --

00:17:08.320 --> 00:17:11.650
13, critical period for cultural
learning and accent learning.

00:17:11.650 --> 00:17:13.870
If you're exposed to a
foreign language first

00:17:13.870 --> 00:17:15.170
at age 14, it's too late.

00:17:15.170 --> 00:17:16.610
You will never speak
it like a native.

00:17:16.610 --> 00:17:17.910
So, what we've done is,

00:17:17.910 --> 00:17:19.390
we've systematically
taken this critical period

00:17:19.390 --> 00:17:21.430
for cultural learning,
independence learning,

00:17:21.430 --> 00:17:24.940
and we said, no independence
for you until it's too late.

00:17:24.940 --> 00:17:26.450
We'll wait until
the window closes,

00:17:26.450 --> 00:17:28.490
we'll wait until the
learning period is over,

00:17:28.490 --> 00:17:30.290
and then we'll say,
now you can go out.

00:17:30.290 --> 00:17:31.590
And guess what?

00:17:31.590 --> 00:17:32.890
They don't go out.

00:17:32.890 --> 00:17:34.560
They don't go out.

00:17:34.560 --> 00:17:37.550
They sit on their bed with their
devices and they communicate.

00:17:37.550 --> 00:17:38.890
So, they're still social,

00:17:38.890 --> 00:17:41.080
but it's in the safety
of their room.

00:17:41.080 --> 00:17:42.380
&gt;&gt; John Haskell: So, you've
got a concept in there

00:17:42.380 --> 00:17:44.280
that there was going
to be anti-fragility.

00:17:44.280 --> 00:17:45.580
&gt;&gt; Jonathan Haidt: Right.

00:17:45.580 --> 00:17:47.040
&gt;&gt; John Haskell: And
that ties to this, right?

00:17:47.040 --> 00:17:48.340
&gt;&gt; Jonathan Haidt: Yeah.

00:17:48.340 --> 00:17:49.640
So, this is such a
powerful concept.

00:17:49.640 --> 00:17:50.940
Raise your hand if you know
what that is, anti-fragility?

00:17:50.940 --> 00:17:52.240
Do you know what that is?

00:17:52.240 --> 00:17:53.540
Very few. So --

00:17:53.540 --> 00:17:54.840
&gt;&gt; John Haskell:
One guy back there.

00:17:54.840 --> 00:17:56.140
&gt;&gt; Jonathan Haidt: So, it's a --

00:17:56.140 --> 00:17:57.440
it's a term coined
by Nassim Taleb,

00:17:57.440 --> 00:17:58.740
the guy who wrote
The Black Swan.

00:17:58.740 --> 00:18:00.040
It's a brilliant concept.

00:18:00.040 --> 00:18:02.010
It's a clunky word, but he made
it up because there is no word

00:18:02.010 --> 00:18:03.800
in the English language
and we need it.

00:18:03.800 --> 00:18:06.740
So, if you think about it,
like a wine glass is fragile

00:18:06.740 --> 00:18:09.850
and nothing good happens if you
drop a wineglass on the ground.

00:18:09.850 --> 00:18:11.150
It's fragile.

00:18:11.150 --> 00:18:13.150
And, so, we give our
kids plastic cups.

00:18:13.150 --> 00:18:15.720
Toddlers get plastic cups
because those are resilient.

00:18:15.720 --> 00:18:18.230
They don't break, but
they don't get better.

00:18:18.230 --> 00:18:21.040
There's nothing good -- it's
like, a glass doesn't get better

00:18:21.040 --> 00:18:22.340
if you drop it on the ground.

00:18:22.340 --> 00:18:24.540
And what Taleb wanted
was a concept for things

00:18:24.540 --> 00:18:26.520
that get better when you
drop them on the ground.

00:18:26.520 --> 00:18:30.790
So, he was studying the banking
system and he predicted in 2006,

00:18:30.790 --> 00:18:34.080
he said, this banking
system is such a mess

00:18:34.080 --> 00:18:36.170
and it's never been tested.

00:18:36.170 --> 00:18:37.610
It's never been tested.

00:18:37.610 --> 00:18:39.870
Anything goes wrong, it's
going down, and he was right.

00:18:39.870 --> 00:18:41.630
And, so, he was trying
to say, well,

00:18:41.630 --> 00:18:44.230
what we need is something
more like the immune system.

00:18:44.230 --> 00:18:46.180
The immune system
is anti-fragile.

00:18:46.180 --> 00:18:48.340
If you keep your kids
safe from bacteria,

00:18:48.340 --> 00:18:49.780
what are you doing to them?

00:18:49.780 --> 00:18:51.080
You're just -- you're just --

00:18:51.080 --> 00:18:53.170
you're depriving their immune
system of the chance to learn.

00:18:53.170 --> 00:18:55.340
The immune system
is anti-fragile.

00:18:55.340 --> 00:18:58.470
The reason why peanut allergies
are going up in this country is

00:18:58.470 --> 00:19:00.720
because we've been
protecting kids from peanuts.

00:19:00.720 --> 00:19:02.680
We don't give them
a chance to learn

00:19:02.680 --> 00:19:03.980
that peanuts are not harmful,

00:19:03.980 --> 00:19:05.650
their immune system
doesn't learn.

00:19:05.650 --> 00:19:09.090
So, this is our point in the
book, children are anti-fragile.

00:19:09.090 --> 00:19:10.780
They have to be -- they have

00:19:10.780 --> 00:19:13.390
to face teasing,
insults, exclusion.

00:19:13.390 --> 00:19:15.560
They have to go out and
get lost and get scared

00:19:15.560 --> 00:19:18.010
and ask someone for
directions home.

00:19:18.010 --> 00:19:19.970
My kids refuse to ask
someone for directions.

00:19:19.970 --> 00:19:21.550
It's terrifying for them.

00:19:21.550 --> 00:19:23.070
You know, because they
haven't had to do it.

00:19:23.070 --> 00:19:24.490
We're trying to push them out.

00:19:24.490 --> 00:19:27.010
Anyway, my point is, you need
a lot of negative experiences

00:19:27.010 --> 00:19:28.310
in order to become
an independently

00:19:28.310 --> 00:19:29.610
functioning person.

00:19:29.610 --> 00:19:30.910
And in the name of
protecting them,

00:19:30.910 --> 00:19:33.820
we have denied them the negative
experiences that they need.

00:19:33.820 --> 00:19:36.040
We don't let them have those
until they're 15 or 16.

00:19:36.040 --> 00:19:37.340
&gt;&gt; John Haskell: And, John,
that's a great segue to the --

00:19:37.340 --> 00:19:39.610
to the next question
I had, which is,

00:19:39.610 --> 00:19:42.800
you and Greg have a lot
of, I mean, there's a lot

00:19:42.800 --> 00:19:46.140
of very specific
remedies in the book,

00:19:46.140 --> 00:19:47.490
both in the realm of parenting.

00:19:47.490 --> 00:19:50.880
The ones I listed just quickly
after reading the book were,

00:19:50.880 --> 00:19:54.700
disconnecting from iPhones,
much more free play,

00:19:54.700 --> 00:19:56.820
de-emphasizing certain
types of safety.

00:19:56.820 --> 00:19:58.120
&gt;&gt; Jonathan Haidt: Yeah.

00:19:58.120 --> 00:19:59.420
&gt;&gt; John Haskell: Which is what
you were just referring to,

00:19:59.420 --> 00:20:01.460
as well as at universities,

00:20:01.460 --> 00:20:04.840
promoting viewpoint diversity
among faculty and other things.

00:20:04.840 --> 00:20:06.720
So, let's plumb a little deeper.

00:20:06.720 --> 00:20:08.020
I mean --

00:20:08.020 --> 00:20:09.320
&gt;&gt; Jonathan Haidt:
But, wait, wait, wait.

00:20:09.320 --> 00:20:10.620
I have a suggestion.

00:20:10.620 --> 00:20:11.920
&gt;&gt; John Haskell: Yeah.

00:20:11.920 --> 00:20:13.220
&gt;&gt; Jonathan Haidt: Let's --

00:20:13.220 --> 00:20:14.520
first, let me lay out
the six causal threats,

00:20:14.520 --> 00:20:15.820
because -- let's lay out --

00:20:15.820 --> 00:20:17.120
&gt;&gt; John Haskell: Okay.

00:20:17.120 --> 00:20:18.420
&gt;&gt; Jonathan Haidt: Like
the multiple causes,

00:20:18.420 --> 00:20:19.720
and then we'll talk about
how to reverse some of those.

00:20:19.720 --> 00:20:21.120
So, I'm a social
scientist, and that means

00:20:21.120 --> 00:20:25.400
that I study social
problems and I just tend --

00:20:25.400 --> 00:20:27.470
you know, we tend
-- everything --

00:20:27.470 --> 00:20:29.820
there's never one
factor causation.

00:20:29.820 --> 00:20:31.120
Almost anything interesting,
there's going

00:20:31.120 --> 00:20:32.420
to be all these different
intersecting,

00:20:32.420 --> 00:20:33.720
interacting factors.

00:20:33.720 --> 00:20:36.230
And, so, we had this very sudden
emergence of this new morality

00:20:36.230 --> 00:20:38.060
on campus in 2014, 2015.

00:20:38.060 --> 00:20:40.520
It seemed to come
out of nowhere.

00:20:40.520 --> 00:20:43.540
And Greg and I in the book, we
trace it out, we say, actually,

00:20:43.540 --> 00:20:45.300
there's six intersecting
threats.

00:20:45.300 --> 00:20:47.970
There's like six fuses all
came together and then they met

00:20:47.970 --> 00:20:50.880
around 2014, 2015,
things blew up.

00:20:50.880 --> 00:20:53.930
So, I'll just briefly
run through them.

00:20:53.930 --> 00:20:58.090
Number one is the political
purification of the universities

00:20:58.090 --> 00:21:01.370
at a time of increasing
political polarization.

00:21:01.370 --> 00:21:05.010
So, professors have always
leaned left, but between 1995,

00:21:05.010 --> 00:21:08.390
when it was just about two or
three to one left right ratio

00:21:08.390 --> 00:21:11.210
on the faculty, to 2010,
by then it's about five

00:21:11.210 --> 00:21:12.900
or six to one left right.

00:21:12.900 --> 00:21:16.160
And the core areas,
English, history, philosophy,

00:21:16.160 --> 00:21:18.090
it's more like 20 or
30 to one left right.

00:21:18.090 --> 00:21:22.260
So, we have universities
shifting much further left

00:21:22.260 --> 00:21:25.330
at a time when the culture
war is heating up, so left

00:21:25.330 --> 00:21:28.320
and right really, really
hate each other more.

00:21:28.320 --> 00:21:32.300
So, if universities are now
more clearly on one side

00:21:32.300 --> 00:21:35.560
of the culture war, their
internal dynamics are going

00:21:35.560 --> 00:21:37.870
to be much more about
fighting the culture war.

00:21:37.870 --> 00:21:39.880
So, we're not free to
just explore ideas.

00:21:39.880 --> 00:21:42.320
If a conservative speaker comes
to campus, it's not like, oh,

00:21:42.320 --> 00:21:43.620
what does he have to say?

00:21:43.620 --> 00:21:44.920
I'm sure he's a schmuck.

00:21:44.920 --> 00:21:46.220
It's, what?

00:21:46.220 --> 00:21:47.520
We can't give him a platform.

00:21:47.520 --> 00:21:51.360
So, the rise in polarization and
political purification is one

00:21:51.360 --> 00:21:52.660
of the big factors

00:21:52.660 --> 00:21:53.960
of why universities
have kind of gone crazy.

00:21:53.960 --> 00:21:57.610
Not most, but the shout downs
are almost all in the northeast

00:21:57.610 --> 00:21:59.310
and the coastal strip
of the west coast.

00:21:59.310 --> 00:22:00.610
That's where the violence

00:22:00.610 --> 00:22:02.850
and the intimidation is
taking place on campus.

00:22:02.850 --> 00:22:05.260
So, the culture war
is a big part it.

00:22:05.260 --> 00:22:08.600
Number two, the rise in
rates of mental illness.

00:22:08.600 --> 00:22:10.930
And, again, this is, I
mentioned this a moment ago,

00:22:10.930 --> 00:22:13.660
the statistics are stunning.

00:22:13.660 --> 00:22:17.260
The self-report anxiety is
going up by a factor of two

00:22:17.260 --> 00:22:20.280
or three in adolescence.

00:22:20.280 --> 00:22:21.810
It's not just self-report,
it's not just

00:22:21.810 --> 00:22:23.890
that they say they're depressed.

00:22:23.890 --> 00:22:27.200
Hospital admissions for
self-harm, for taking --

00:22:27.200 --> 00:22:30.170
drinking poison, or cutting
yourself with a sharp object,

00:22:30.170 --> 00:22:32.500
those show the exact same
pattern, way up for girls,

00:22:32.500 --> 00:22:36.050
not so much up for boys, but
way up for teenage girls.

00:22:36.050 --> 00:22:41.400
Suicide is up 25% for boys from
the first decade of this century

00:22:41.400 --> 00:22:45.610
to the last couple years, 25%
increase in the suicide rate

00:22:45.610 --> 00:22:48.040
for boys, which is huge.

00:22:48.040 --> 00:22:54.100
For girls it's 70%, seven zero
percent increase in suicide

00:22:54.100 --> 00:22:55.720
for teenage American girls.

00:22:55.720 --> 00:22:59.680
The same thing is
happening in the UK.

00:22:59.680 --> 00:23:02.340
So, we have a real
crisis on campus.

00:23:02.340 --> 00:23:04.420
This is even before
they get to campus.

00:23:04.420 --> 00:23:06.130
But now we have all these
people with depression

00:23:06.130 --> 00:23:08.090
and anxiety coming to campus,

00:23:08.090 --> 00:23:10.440
and some of them say they
want trigger warnings.

00:23:10.440 --> 00:23:11.740
They want safe spaces.

00:23:11.740 --> 00:23:13.040
They want protection.

00:23:13.040 --> 00:23:15.170
And what university can
say, no, tough it out?

00:23:15.170 --> 00:23:18.260
You can't say that, because
then if she commits suicide,

00:23:18.260 --> 00:23:20.400
of course, you're
exposed to liability.

00:23:20.400 --> 00:23:21.900
I mean, there's other
reasons, compassion,

00:23:21.900 --> 00:23:23.550
of course, is a major reason.

00:23:23.550 --> 00:23:25.530
But the administrators,
and this is another threat,

00:23:25.530 --> 00:23:27.820
the administrators become
increasingly focused

00:23:27.820 --> 00:23:31.450
on liability, not on education,
so they get defensive.

00:23:31.450 --> 00:23:34.430
And, so, we get all these
things coming together

00:23:34.430 --> 00:23:37.310
to change the speech culture
and the administration on campus

00:23:37.310 --> 00:23:40.020
so that it's not
about healthy debate,

00:23:40.020 --> 00:23:41.660
it's not about vigorous
argument,

00:23:41.660 --> 00:23:45.830
it's not about fearless inquiry,
it's about safety in danger.

00:23:45.830 --> 00:23:47.380
And what we're talking
about the safety danger is,

00:23:47.380 --> 00:23:50.090
ideas, books, words.

00:23:50.090 --> 00:23:53.700
So, my kids get this in third
grade, it's all about safety

00:23:53.700 --> 00:23:56.840
and danger, not physical,
emotional,

00:23:56.840 --> 00:23:58.780
and this is a terrible
thing to teach kids,

00:23:58.780 --> 00:24:01.350
that negative emotions
mean you're in danger and;

00:24:01.350 --> 00:24:02.970
therefore, you need protection.

00:24:02.970 --> 00:24:05.550
So, there's all these
things coming together

00:24:05.550 --> 00:24:09.230
so that kids born after 1995
haven't been given the chance

00:24:09.230 --> 00:24:11.500
to practice maturity
and independence.

00:24:11.500 --> 00:24:13.810
We've been overprotecting
them, and that's why the title

00:24:13.810 --> 00:24:15.710
of the book is The Coddling
of the American Mind.

00:24:15.710 --> 00:24:17.170
Coddling means overprotection.

00:24:17.170 --> 00:24:20.420
And the subtitle is,
How Good Intentions

00:24:20.420 --> 00:24:23.310
and Bad Ideas Are Setting
Up a Generation For Failure.

00:24:23.310 --> 00:24:26.460
So, anyway, all those threads,
they're hard to reverse.

00:24:26.460 --> 00:24:27.760
&gt;&gt; John Haskell: Okay.

00:24:27.760 --> 00:24:31.320
So, my thinking when I read
the book, of the remedies,

00:24:31.320 --> 00:24:34.840
which are all these, what makes
sense when you get people away

00:24:34.840 --> 00:24:38.070
from their iPhones, universities
need to have more diversity

00:24:38.070 --> 00:24:40.800
of viewpoints in the faculty,
let's say, but those are running

00:24:40.800 --> 00:24:43.880
into what I describe as
category six headwinds.

00:24:43.880 --> 00:24:45.180
&gt;&gt; Jonathan Haidt: Uh-huh, yeah.

00:24:45.180 --> 00:24:46.660
&gt;&gt; John Haskell: I mean, it's
going against the zeitgeist,

00:24:46.660 --> 00:24:48.310
or whatever, however
you want to describe it.

00:24:48.310 --> 00:24:50.610
So, what are you -- what are
you trying to do about that?

00:24:50.610 --> 00:24:52.570
&gt;&gt; Jonathan Haidt: Yeah, so,
it's true that if you look

00:24:52.570 --> 00:24:54.250
at the six trends
that we lay out,

00:24:54.250 --> 00:24:57.010
none of them are
easily reversible,

00:24:57.010 --> 00:24:58.310
especially the polarization.

00:24:58.310 --> 00:24:59.660
That, I think, is just
going to get worse

00:24:59.660 --> 00:25:01.090
and worse in this country.

00:25:01.090 --> 00:25:05.860
But I'm actually optimistic
that we can -- if you break --

00:25:05.860 --> 00:25:07.770
let's break the problem down.

00:25:07.770 --> 00:25:09.630
We have to change what
we're doing to kids.

00:25:09.630 --> 00:25:13.140
We have to change the
way we're teaching kids,

00:25:13.140 --> 00:25:15.680
especially in high school
before they get to college.

00:25:15.680 --> 00:25:18.280
And then we have to change what
we're doing in universities.

00:25:18.280 --> 00:25:20.390
I'm really optimistic that
we can change childhood

00:25:20.390 --> 00:25:21.690
for this reason.

00:25:21.690 --> 00:25:24.490
Parents want what's -- well,
parents want what's best

00:25:24.490 --> 00:25:28.140
for their kids, but
that's not entirely true.

00:25:28.140 --> 00:25:30.650
Parents really, really want
their kids to be successful,

00:25:30.650 --> 00:25:32.390
and especially to get
into a top college.

00:25:32.390 --> 00:25:34.430
And if that means their
kids have to be unhappier,

00:25:34.430 --> 00:25:37.570
they're going to do it.

00:25:37.570 --> 00:25:40.130
But now that it's becoming
clear that if you want

00:25:40.130 --> 00:25:43.950
to prepare your kid for success
and to get into a good college,

00:25:43.950 --> 00:25:47.600
don't make them study
-- don't schedule --

00:25:47.600 --> 00:25:50.650
don't overschedule them, make
them study from the age of four

00:25:50.650 --> 00:25:55.090
through 16, that's setting them
up for weakness and frailty.

00:25:55.090 --> 00:25:57.550
Now, that it's clear
there's no evidence

00:25:57.550 --> 00:25:59.470
that starting academic
training at age four,

00:25:59.470 --> 00:26:01.240
five, or six does any good.

00:26:01.240 --> 00:26:03.880
In Scandinavia and Germany they
don't start until age seven,

00:26:03.880 --> 00:26:05.510
before then it's all about play.

00:26:05.510 --> 00:26:08.090
That's what kids are
supposed to do, is play.

00:26:08.090 --> 00:26:09.390
So, now that it's clear

00:26:09.390 --> 00:26:10.690
that there's a mental
health catastrophe,

00:26:10.690 --> 00:26:12.680
especially for girls,
now that it's clear

00:26:12.680 --> 00:26:15.780
that early academic training at
ages four, five, six don't help

00:26:15.780 --> 00:26:18.450
at all, now that
it's finally clear

00:26:18.450 --> 00:26:21.890
that play is actually
what the kids need to do,

00:26:21.890 --> 00:26:26.250
now we're in a situation where
lots of parents want to do that

00:26:26.250 --> 00:26:27.830
but they don't know
how to start.

00:26:27.830 --> 00:26:30.870
So, when I read about all this a
few years ago, a wonderful book,

00:26:30.870 --> 00:26:34.280
Free Range Kids by Lenore
Skenazy, I tried to get my seven

00:26:34.280 --> 00:26:36.710
or eight-year-old son to go
outside and go to the store,

00:26:36.710 --> 00:26:39.730
he'd say, but people
look at me funny.

00:26:39.730 --> 00:26:41.650
There are no other
kids out there,

00:26:41.650 --> 00:26:42.950
and he's afraid of
getting busted.

00:26:42.950 --> 00:26:45.060
I gave him a little
license that said, you know,

00:26:45.060 --> 00:26:48.500
if you're thinking of arresting
me, please go read Huck Finn,

00:26:48.500 --> 00:26:50.270
and then, you know, and
then call my father.

00:26:50.270 --> 00:26:52.160
You know, I have
permission to be outside.

00:26:52.160 --> 00:26:55.230
But he was shy about it.

00:26:55.230 --> 00:26:57.460
So, it's a social
coordination problem.

00:26:57.460 --> 00:27:01.410
So, but there are ways
to solve the problem.

00:27:01.410 --> 00:27:04.290
So, Utah is the first state,
the only state in the country

00:27:04.290 --> 00:27:06.910
that passed a free-range
parenting law.

00:27:06.910 --> 00:27:10.500
They specifically said last
March, they finally passed it,

00:27:10.500 --> 00:27:13.100
you cannot be arrested for
letting your kids outside

00:27:13.100 --> 00:27:16.650
to play, and that clear
statement means a lot more

00:27:16.650 --> 00:27:20.560
parents are willing to say,
okay, kids, go to the park.

00:27:20.560 --> 00:27:24.880
So, if every state,
whatever state you're in,

00:27:24.880 --> 00:27:26.660
call your state reps, ask them

00:27:26.660 --> 00:27:28.520
to introduce a free-range
parenting bill.

00:27:28.520 --> 00:27:29.960
That's the first step.

00:27:29.960 --> 00:27:32.970
Second, if you have kids or
grandkids, there are ways

00:27:32.970 --> 00:27:35.560
to coordinate so that all the
kids in the neighborhood know,

00:27:35.560 --> 00:27:39.620
you meet at this playground, you
meet in this person's backyard.

00:27:39.620 --> 00:27:42.530
Kids have to have a lot
more unsupervised time.

00:27:42.530 --> 00:27:44.960
Unsupervised doesn't mean
nobody knows where they are,

00:27:44.960 --> 00:27:47.010
it means no adult is watching.

00:27:47.010 --> 00:27:49.390
No adult is going to step
in to resolve conflict.

00:27:49.390 --> 00:27:50.940
If someone gets badly
hurt they know, okay,

00:27:50.940 --> 00:27:52.240
we go to Mrs. Smith's house.

00:27:52.240 --> 00:27:53.540
She's right there.

00:27:53.540 --> 00:27:56.970
But kids have to have a lot
more time to work out conflicts.

00:27:56.970 --> 00:27:59.370
That's preparation
for democracy.

00:27:59.370 --> 00:28:03.110
When kids play in groups they
learn how to work things out,

00:28:03.110 --> 00:28:05.410
how to keep the game
going by being responsive

00:28:05.410 --> 00:28:06.710
to other people's needs.

00:28:06.710 --> 00:28:08.100
They learn compromise.

00:28:08.100 --> 00:28:11.750
They learn how to enforce rules
and make rules that are fair.

00:28:11.750 --> 00:28:13.540
So, I'm actually
really optimistic.

00:28:13.540 --> 00:28:15.840
There's so much unhappiness
with par [phonetic] --

00:28:15.840 --> 00:28:19.340
among parents about the lack
of play, the overscheduling,

00:28:19.340 --> 00:28:22.680
the constantly being on
devices, but, you know,

00:28:22.680 --> 00:28:25.300
but if you just tell your
kid, you can't be on a device,

00:28:25.300 --> 00:28:26.600
what are they going to do?

00:28:26.600 --> 00:28:27.900
No, there's no other
kids outside.

00:28:27.900 --> 00:28:29.200
So, we have to solve all
the problems together.

00:28:29.200 --> 00:28:32.430
So, I'm optimistic we're going
to make progress on that.

00:28:32.430 --> 00:28:33.780
In high schools --

00:28:33.780 --> 00:28:35.080
&gt;&gt; John Haskell: Why
is it worse for girls?

00:28:35.080 --> 00:28:36.380
Why is the mental health --

00:28:36.380 --> 00:28:37.680
&gt;&gt; Jonathan Haidt: Yeah.

00:28:37.680 --> 00:28:38.980
&gt;&gt; John Haskell:
Situation worse for girls?

00:28:38.980 --> 00:28:40.280
&gt;&gt; Jonathan Haidt:
So, we don't know,

00:28:40.280 --> 00:28:41.580
but the leading thought is this.

00:28:41.580 --> 00:28:42.880
So, again, this is Jean
Twenge, T W E N G E,

00:28:42.880 --> 00:28:44.250
who wrote this book, iGen.

00:28:44.250 --> 00:28:46.550
So, think about it this way.

00:28:46.550 --> 00:28:48.210
All kids love devices.

00:28:48.210 --> 00:28:49.510
Most of us, when we were kids,

00:28:49.510 --> 00:28:51.520
we couldn't take our
eyes off the TV screen.

00:28:51.520 --> 00:28:53.610
Our parents said it
would rot our brains.

00:28:53.610 --> 00:28:56.330
It turns out, TV isn't
that bad for you,

00:28:56.330 --> 00:28:59.730
but not playing outside
is bad for you.

00:28:59.730 --> 00:29:03.920
So, the TV itself wasn't so bad.

00:29:03.920 --> 00:29:05.520
Social media is really
different.

00:29:05.520 --> 00:29:08.530
If you give -- if you suddenly
let all kids, you know,

00:29:08.530 --> 00:29:11.760
by age eight, nine, 10,
have a device, what happens?

00:29:11.760 --> 00:29:13.060
What do the boys do?

00:29:13.060 --> 00:29:14.450
Just call it out, those
of you who have sons.

00:29:14.450 --> 00:29:17.160
What do your boys
do with devices?

00:29:17.160 --> 00:29:18.460
Videogames, that's right.

00:29:18.460 --> 00:29:19.760
They play videogames
all day long.

00:29:19.760 --> 00:29:22.050
It turns out, videogames
aren't really bad for you.

00:29:22.050 --> 00:29:25.600
They take you away from outdoor
play, but they're often social.

00:29:25.600 --> 00:29:27.000
My son is playing, you
know, they're like --

00:29:27.000 --> 00:29:29.380
they're like, you know,
they're a team trying

00:29:29.380 --> 00:29:30.680
to kill other teams.

00:29:30.680 --> 00:29:33.130
That's actually pretty
good for you.

00:29:33.130 --> 00:29:35.220
What do girls do?

00:29:35.220 --> 00:29:39.270
Girls are taking selfies,

00:29:39.270 --> 00:29:41.780
that take a long,
long time to compose.

00:29:41.780 --> 00:29:44.320
They have filters to make
themselves look more beautiful.

00:29:44.320 --> 00:29:46.770
So, we're all aware that
models are not real,

00:29:46.770 --> 00:29:49.840
that girls are exposed to models
in magazines that aren't real.

00:29:49.840 --> 00:29:51.880
We've talked about this
for 20 or 30 years,

00:29:51.880 --> 00:29:53.800
that girls have unreasonable
beauty standards.

00:29:53.800 --> 00:29:56.720
Now, suddenly, their
friends, the women --

00:29:56.720 --> 00:29:58.680
the girls around
them, are distorted

00:29:58.680 --> 00:30:01.070
to look more beautiful, to
the point where now girls

00:30:01.070 --> 00:30:04.560
and young women are
asking for plastic surgery

00:30:04.560 --> 00:30:07.990
so that they can look more
like their Instagram photos.

00:30:07.990 --> 00:30:11.430
So, girls are doing a lot
more social comparison.

00:30:11.430 --> 00:30:13.600
Girls feel much more inadequate.

00:30:13.600 --> 00:30:17.510
And, especially, girls'
sociality is based on who's in,

00:30:17.510 --> 00:30:20.330
who knows whose secrets,
who is being excluded.

00:30:20.330 --> 00:30:21.630
Girls are much more about that.

00:30:21.630 --> 00:30:23.930
Boys are more about dominance in
sports, hierarchy, and ability.

00:30:23.930 --> 00:30:25.230
They're more vertical.

00:30:25.230 --> 00:30:26.530
Girls are more horizontal.

00:30:26.530 --> 00:30:27.830
And Facebook, Instagram,

00:30:27.830 --> 00:30:31.300
these things are incredibly
powerful ways to let girls know

00:30:31.300 --> 00:30:34.450
that they were not included
in this fun, fun event,

00:30:34.450 --> 00:30:37.270
which is distorted to look
really super fun, to the point

00:30:37.270 --> 00:30:40.910
where some college girls say,
I can't make it to that party.

00:30:40.910 --> 00:30:43.960
Can you take my phone, take
some photos, and I'll post it

00:30:43.960 --> 00:30:45.620
to make it look like
I was there?

00:30:45.620 --> 00:30:47.200
I mean, this is crazy stuff,

00:30:47.200 --> 00:30:50.120
but you can imagine
how teenage girls,

00:30:50.120 --> 00:30:51.620
it really does a number on them.

00:30:51.620 --> 00:30:53.790
If you -- so, if you first
get this stuff when you're 18

00:30:53.790 --> 00:30:55.090
or 19, it's not so bad.

00:30:55.090 --> 00:30:57.950
But if you first got it when
you were 13, in other words,

00:30:57.950 --> 00:31:00.300
if you were born in 1995 or
after, and you get this stuff

00:31:00.300 --> 00:31:03.560
when you were 13, it's
really bad for girls.

00:31:03.560 --> 00:31:05.330
&gt;&gt; John Haskell: So,
switching gears a little bit.

00:31:05.330 --> 00:31:08.510
Well, let's stick with
that actually for a second.

00:31:08.510 --> 00:31:10.730
What about the headwinds
in universities?

00:31:10.730 --> 00:31:14.500
You know, because colleges, some
folks probably in this room went

00:31:14.500 --> 00:31:18.010
to some of the more elite
places, they're more liberal.

00:31:18.010 --> 00:31:21.620
You know, there's -- tenure
has the effect of, well,

00:31:21.620 --> 00:31:24.310
I'm going to hire people
who think like I do.

00:31:24.310 --> 00:31:26.410
That's supposed to be academic
freedom or something, right?

00:31:26.410 --> 00:31:27.710
&gt;&gt; Jonathan Haidt: Yeah,
yeah, that's right.

00:31:27.710 --> 00:31:29.100
&gt;&gt; John Haskell: So,
there isn't the diversity,

00:31:29.100 --> 00:31:31.580
and then you have this group
mentality, the Durkheimian thing

00:31:31.580 --> 00:31:33.180
that you -- that you raised.

00:31:33.180 --> 00:31:35.370
So, how do you combat that?

00:31:35.370 --> 00:31:37.490
&gt;&gt; Jonathan Haidt: Yeah,
so, at universities we have

00:31:37.490 --> 00:31:39.150
to make a lot of changes.

00:31:39.150 --> 00:31:43.190
One reason I'm optimistic
is that anybody

00:31:43.190 --> 00:31:46.030
who is a university president
or dean or administrator,

00:31:46.030 --> 00:31:48.320
it's always been a difficult
job, but in the last two

00:31:48.320 --> 00:31:49.890
or three years they all
say their job is becoming

00:31:49.890 --> 00:31:52.520
impossible, because if
there's any conflict

00:31:52.520 --> 00:31:54.800
between any two students,
one person tells a joke,

00:31:54.800 --> 00:31:56.950
one person makes a reference,
one person wears a piece

00:31:56.950 --> 00:31:58.470
of clothing they
bought vacation,

00:31:58.470 --> 00:31:59.770
that's cultural appropriation.

00:31:59.770 --> 00:32:01.070
That's insensitive.

00:32:01.070 --> 00:32:02.370
That's offensive.

00:32:02.370 --> 00:32:03.700
And these things can
blow up to the point

00:32:03.700 --> 00:32:05.260
where they can get
into the newspaper.

00:32:05.260 --> 00:32:07.740
They never know when there
will be a group protesting,

00:32:07.740 --> 00:32:09.040
demanding that they intervene,

00:32:09.040 --> 00:32:10.340
demanding that they
punish someone.

00:32:10.340 --> 00:32:12.140
It's an impossible situation.

00:32:12.140 --> 00:32:13.780
So, university presidents
are finally ready

00:32:13.780 --> 00:32:17.080
to exert some leadership, if
they -- if they know what to do.

00:32:17.080 --> 00:32:18.380
The first two years were marked

00:32:18.380 --> 00:32:20.060
by an almost complete
absence of leadership.

00:32:20.060 --> 00:32:23.430
One reason is because
the complaints often come

00:32:23.430 --> 00:32:26.300
from either the black
students' group,

00:32:26.300 --> 00:32:29.230
the women students' group, the
LGBT group, and nobody wants

00:32:29.230 --> 00:32:31.000
to stand up against them
and appear insensitive.

00:32:31.000 --> 00:32:32.300
We're very progressive.

00:32:32.300 --> 00:32:35.060
We're very focused on diversity
and inclusion to the extent

00:32:35.060 --> 00:32:37.330
that a lot of these protests
are linked in some way

00:32:37.330 --> 00:32:41.170
to an identity issue, nobody
can stand up against that.

00:32:41.170 --> 00:32:44.460
One reason I'm optimistic
is that in the last year

00:32:44.460 --> 00:32:48.300
so many people, so many
great people, are writing,

00:32:48.300 --> 00:32:50.990
these are people who are
not straight white males,

00:32:50.990 --> 00:32:53.890
are writing to say the way
we're doing identity politics is

00:32:53.890 --> 00:32:56.640
really bad for everybody,
including my group.

00:32:56.640 --> 00:32:59.390
So, you know, black
scholars are not uniform.

00:32:59.390 --> 00:33:01.140
There's a lot of diversity
among them, and we're beginning

00:33:01.140 --> 00:33:05.060
to see some, like John
McWhorter, a whole bunch,

00:33:05.060 --> 00:33:06.360
that are now saying, wait,

00:33:06.360 --> 00:33:07.860
this kind of identity
[inaudible] is really bad

00:33:07.860 --> 00:33:09.300
for black students.

00:33:09.300 --> 00:33:13.970
Amy Chua, a Chinese-American
scholar at Yale Law School,

00:33:13.970 --> 00:33:16.350
has this great book
on political tribes.

00:33:16.350 --> 00:33:20.060
Francis Fukuyama just came out
with a book called Identity.

00:33:20.060 --> 00:33:22.890
So, a lot of scholars, who
are not straight white males,

00:33:22.890 --> 00:33:27.350
are saying, this is nuts to
say let's all band together,

00:33:27.350 --> 00:33:28.650
us versus the straight
white males,

00:33:28.650 --> 00:33:30.700
because they are the source of
the problem and let, you know --

00:33:30.700 --> 00:33:33.970
the us versus them thinking
that is now rising in prominence

00:33:33.970 --> 00:33:35.610
on campus, this is
a dead-end street.

00:33:35.610 --> 00:33:38.040
This is never going to lead
to a welcoming environment

00:33:38.040 --> 00:33:39.450
where people feel welcome.

00:33:39.450 --> 00:33:41.730
It's going to lead
to constant conflict.

00:33:41.730 --> 00:33:44.990
In -- and here, we can come back
to the country at large now,

00:33:44.990 --> 00:33:49.880
a multiethnic secular
democracy is like a contraption

00:33:49.880 --> 00:33:52.140
that should never fly.

00:33:52.140 --> 00:33:55.750
Political organization for our
species is almost always based

00:33:55.750 --> 00:33:59.600
on ties of blood or soil.

00:33:59.600 --> 00:34:03.540
You get religions like Islam
that transcend it with God.

00:34:03.540 --> 00:34:05.810
So, either blood, soil, or God.

00:34:05.810 --> 00:34:08.030
Those are your options.

00:34:08.030 --> 00:34:09.330
America was an experiment.

00:34:09.330 --> 00:34:10.830
We talk about the
American experiment.

00:34:10.830 --> 00:34:12.130
It was an experiment.

00:34:12.130 --> 00:34:13.660
It probably shouldn't
have worked.

00:34:13.660 --> 00:34:15.420
But, and it almost didn't work,

00:34:15.420 --> 00:34:17.880
but if you get everything
lined up right it can work.

00:34:17.880 --> 00:34:21.240
Clearly, a secular liberal
in the true, you know,

00:34:21.240 --> 00:34:23.570
philosophical sense, a secular
liberal democracy can work,

00:34:23.570 --> 00:34:26.200
and they worked all over
Europe until recently.

00:34:26.200 --> 00:34:27.500
Now they're not working.

00:34:27.500 --> 00:34:29.310
What's going on?

00:34:29.310 --> 00:34:32.960
Issues of immigration,
identity, division,

00:34:32.960 --> 00:34:35.380
these blow things apart.

00:34:35.380 --> 00:34:38.170
America was brilliant
in the 20th century

00:34:38.170 --> 00:34:40.380
at forming an overarching
identity,

00:34:40.380 --> 00:34:41.990
saying we don't care
what your blood is,

00:34:41.990 --> 00:34:44.290
we don't care we came
from, if you believe

00:34:44.290 --> 00:34:47.350
in the American ideals,
you're in.

00:34:47.350 --> 00:34:53.070
America had a way of creating
a superordinate identity

00:34:53.070 --> 00:34:55.320
that was the envy of the world.

00:34:55.320 --> 00:34:58.770
And now, many of us think
we're going down roads

00:34:58.770 --> 00:35:02.840
of certain forms of identity
politics that reverse that

00:35:02.840 --> 00:35:05.520
and that turn our
diversity into a weakness.

00:35:05.520 --> 00:35:07.340
Diversity is not
automatically a strength.

00:35:07.340 --> 00:35:10.200
It can be, it can
also be a weakness,

00:35:10.200 --> 00:35:12.380
and I think we're
mismanaging at universities,

00:35:12.380 --> 00:35:14.210
they're mismanaging a lot
of European countries,

00:35:14.210 --> 00:35:17.220
and the results could
be really devastating.

00:35:17.220 --> 00:35:19.210
&gt;&gt; John Haskell: And before we
go to the questions from the --

00:35:19.210 --> 00:35:21.850
from the audience, I have
a hard question for you

00:35:21.850 --> 00:35:23.370
and then a really easy one.

00:35:23.370 --> 00:35:24.670
&gt;&gt; Jonathan Haidt: Okay.

00:35:24.670 --> 00:35:25.970
&gt;&gt; John Haskell: The easy
one you can do real quickly,

00:35:25.970 --> 00:35:27.630
but the hard one maybe you
might need some more time.

00:35:27.630 --> 00:35:31.380
So, the Attorney General, Jeff
Sessions, and the Secretary

00:35:31.380 --> 00:35:34.230
of Education, Betsy DeVos,
they talk a lot about --

00:35:34.230 --> 00:35:35.530
&gt;&gt; Jonathan Haidt: Yeah.

00:35:35.530 --> 00:35:36.830
&gt;&gt; John Haskell:
Viewpoint diversity.

00:35:36.830 --> 00:35:38.130
DeVos even cited
one of your lectures

00:35:38.130 --> 00:35:39.850
in a speech quite recently.

00:35:39.850 --> 00:35:41.620
Is this helpful to you?

00:35:41.620 --> 00:35:43.260
&gt;&gt; Jonathan Haidt:
That's the easy question.

00:35:43.260 --> 00:35:44.560
No.

00:35:44.560 --> 00:35:48.920
&gt;&gt; John Haskell: That was
the hard question [laughter].

00:35:48.920 --> 00:35:51.030
&gt;&gt; Jonathan Haidt: Let
me elaborate on that.

00:35:51.030 --> 00:35:54.830
So, I found -- I cofounded a
group called Heterodox Academy.

00:35:54.830 --> 00:35:56.660
Is anybody here a
professor in any way?

00:35:56.660 --> 00:35:58.490
Are you listed at
the webpage of any --

00:35:58.490 --> 00:36:00.920
okay, all of you professors,
if you're listed on the webpage

00:36:00.920 --> 00:36:04.220
of any university, I urge you
to go to heterodoxacademy.org.

00:36:04.220 --> 00:36:08.160
We founded it in 2015.

00:36:08.160 --> 00:36:11.420
It's a bunch -- it's now
2300 professors who believe

00:36:11.420 --> 00:36:15.350
that viewpoint diversity is a
good thing, that we have to seek

00:36:15.350 --> 00:36:18.800
out and welcome political
diversity, in particular.

00:36:18.800 --> 00:36:20.100
I'm really proud of the fact

00:36:20.100 --> 00:36:22.150
that we're the only
politically diverse organization

00:36:22.150 --> 00:36:23.950
in the academy that I know of.

00:36:23.950 --> 00:36:27.340
We're about 20% professors on
the left, 20% on the right,

00:36:27.340 --> 00:36:29.290
and we're mostly all the
people who don't fit in,

00:36:29.290 --> 00:36:31.040
so it's libertarians, centrists,

00:36:31.040 --> 00:36:36.780
and people who are
just really heterodox.

00:36:36.780 --> 00:36:38.080
So, we've been advocating

00:36:38.080 --> 00:36:40.370
for more viewpoint
diversity since 2015.

00:36:40.370 --> 00:36:44.300
Donald Trump in his very first,
when he had that first debate,

00:36:44.300 --> 00:36:46.810
you know, he was sort of
introduced to the country,

00:36:46.810 --> 00:36:48.500
the very first thing he says is,

00:36:48.500 --> 00:36:51.780
there's too much political
correctness in the country.

00:36:51.780 --> 00:36:53.410
And we don't talk a lot
about political correctness,

00:36:53.410 --> 00:36:55.010
but we are kind of
pushing back against it.

00:36:55.010 --> 00:36:59.030
It was like, oh no, I
don't want him on my side.

00:36:59.030 --> 00:37:03.510
And, Betsy DeVos is on my side
and Jeff Sessions is on my side.

00:37:03.510 --> 00:37:06.140
And the only point
I'm making here is

00:37:06.140 --> 00:37:09.120
that universities are
left-leaning progressive

00:37:09.120 --> 00:37:13.600
institutions, that if you
push them from outside,

00:37:13.600 --> 00:37:15.300
and especially Congress
has a history

00:37:15.300 --> 00:37:16.770
of managing things terribly.

00:37:16.770 --> 00:37:18.840
I mean, if Congress is going to
legislate how you do something,

00:37:18.840 --> 00:37:20.420
it's going to be a disaster.

00:37:20.420 --> 00:37:23.360
So, I don't want the
federal government saying,

00:37:23.360 --> 00:37:25.220
universities need to --

00:37:25.220 --> 00:37:28.480
we're going to punish those that
don't have 50% Conservatives.

00:37:28.480 --> 00:37:29.780
I mean, this is not helpful.

00:37:29.780 --> 00:37:31.080
This is not a good idea.

00:37:31.080 --> 00:37:33.270
So, I think that
we can solve it.

00:37:33.270 --> 00:37:35.070
I think we now have the will.

00:37:35.070 --> 00:37:36.900
We now have a much
better understanding.

00:37:36.900 --> 00:37:38.920
I think we can solve
this problem ourselves.

00:37:38.920 --> 00:37:44.140
And if, in a time of a culture
war, if viewpoint diversity

00:37:44.140 --> 00:37:47.870
and openness to free inquiry,
if these become things

00:37:47.870 --> 00:37:51.030
that the Conservatives want,
then ipso facto, they're going

00:37:51.030 --> 00:37:53.140
to be things that the
Progressives don't want.

00:37:53.140 --> 00:37:55.830
Just as Obama Care was
a Conservative idea,

00:37:55.830 --> 00:37:58.850
but once Obama took it on now
Conservatives were against it.

00:37:58.850 --> 00:38:00.150
That's the nature

00:38:00.150 --> 00:38:02.490
of a polarization cycle
and a culture war.

00:38:02.490 --> 00:38:04.830
So, I'd really rather
they just stay out of it.

00:38:04.830 --> 00:38:06.980
&gt;&gt; John Haskell: But it
actually illustrates one

00:38:06.980 --> 00:38:09.450
of the things you talk about
in, maybe all of your books,

00:38:09.450 --> 00:38:13.060
but certainly the two I've read,
is that just because somebody's

00:38:13.060 --> 00:38:15.480
on the other team doesn't
mean they're always wrong,

00:38:15.480 --> 00:38:18.500
and that's one of the, you know,
the things that you've stressed,

00:38:18.500 --> 00:38:20.170
that's one of the -- you know,

00:38:20.170 --> 00:38:21.630
it's a cognitive,
it's a CBT thing.

00:38:21.630 --> 00:38:22.930
&gt;&gt; Jonathan Haidt: Yeah.

00:38:22.930 --> 00:38:24.690
&gt;&gt; John Haskell: Like, they're
not necessarily wrong all

00:38:24.690 --> 00:38:25.990
the time.

00:38:25.990 --> 00:38:27.660
You may disagree with Betsy
DeVos 93% of the time,

00:38:27.660 --> 00:38:29.770
it doesn't mean she can't
stumble upon the truth every now

00:38:29.770 --> 00:38:31.070
and then.

00:38:31.070 --> 00:38:32.370
&gt;&gt; Jonathan Haidt: That's right.

00:38:32.370 --> 00:38:33.670
&gt;&gt; John Haskell: So, you
want to take it seriously.

00:38:33.670 --> 00:38:34.970
&gt;&gt; Jonathan Haidt:
Yeah, that's right.

00:38:34.970 --> 00:38:36.270
So, politics is one
kind of game,

00:38:36.270 --> 00:38:38.180
and it's analogous more to war.

00:38:38.180 --> 00:38:39.820
Well, you know, politics
is supposed

00:38:39.820 --> 00:38:41.230
to be a positive sum game,

00:38:41.230 --> 00:38:44.500
but current American
politics is more like war.

00:38:44.500 --> 00:38:46.550
University life is
nothing like that.

00:38:46.550 --> 00:38:50.070
University life, we need
-- we need our opponents.

00:38:50.070 --> 00:38:52.390
We need to be challenged
because we're all so subject

00:38:52.390 --> 00:38:54.790
to the confirmation
bias, we're all so --

00:38:54.790 --> 00:38:57.640
scientists are not just
really smart people,

00:38:57.640 --> 00:38:59.990
and they don't make discoveries
because they're so smart,

00:38:59.990 --> 00:39:03.210
scientists are productive
because they have an institution

00:39:03.210 --> 00:39:04.510
in which they're put together

00:39:04.510 --> 00:39:06.830
so that whatever they say
will be challenged by others.

00:39:06.830 --> 00:39:10.180
And it's that challenge process
that knocks down the bad ideas,

00:39:10.180 --> 00:39:12.970
that strips us of
our wishful thinking.

00:39:12.970 --> 00:39:14.270
Politics isn't like that.

00:39:14.270 --> 00:39:16.010
Politics, at its
best, can do that,

00:39:16.010 --> 00:39:17.710
that's what a deliberative
body is supposed to be,

00:39:17.710 --> 00:39:20.340
but they don't do that in
the Senate chambers anymore.

00:39:20.340 --> 00:39:22.230
&gt;&gt; John Haskell: So, the
quick sum up, I thought,

00:39:22.230 --> 00:39:26.000
might be useful for people is,
that you open the book talking

00:39:26.000 --> 00:39:27.900
about the three great untruths.

00:39:27.900 --> 00:39:30.550
And you've touched on all three
of them, but it might be good

00:39:30.550 --> 00:39:32.080
to sort of list the three.

00:39:32.080 --> 00:39:33.570
&gt;&gt; Jonathan Haidt: Yeah, sure.

00:39:33.570 --> 00:39:36.650
So, yeah, so, the subtitle of
the book is, How Bad Ideas --

00:39:36.650 --> 00:39:39.480
How Good Intentions and
Bad Ideas Are Setting

00:39:39.480 --> 00:39:40.780
Up a Generation For Failure.

00:39:40.780 --> 00:39:43.260
Here are the three bad ideas
that the book is about.

00:39:43.260 --> 00:39:46.360
What doesn't kill
you makes you weaker.

00:39:46.360 --> 00:39:49.070
Always trust your feelings.

00:39:49.070 --> 00:39:53.740
Life is a battle between
good people and evil people.

00:39:53.740 --> 00:39:56.560
All three of these
are really bad ideas.

00:39:56.560 --> 00:40:00.040
All three of these are the exact
opposite of ancient wisdom.

00:40:00.040 --> 00:40:01.550
My first book, The
Happiness Hypothesis,

00:40:01.550 --> 00:40:04.340
had 10 chapters devoted
to 10 psychological ideas,

00:40:04.340 --> 00:40:06.020
that you find all
over the world.

00:40:06.020 --> 00:40:08.500
Those three that I just said
are the exact opposites of three

00:40:08.500 --> 00:40:10.690
of the chapters in
my first book.

00:40:10.690 --> 00:40:13.310
If we can teach our kids
to believe all three,

00:40:13.310 --> 00:40:16.010
we can almost guarantee
that they will fail in life,

00:40:16.010 --> 00:40:18.520
and they will move back with
you after college [laughter],

00:40:18.520 --> 00:40:21.320
and that's what we're doing.

00:40:21.320 --> 00:40:23.480
&gt;&gt; John Haskell: All right,
so, let's see what kind

00:40:23.480 --> 00:40:24.780
of questions folks might have.

00:40:24.780 --> 00:40:26.080
Who's got the mic?

00:40:26.080 --> 00:40:27.380
You have the mic, Travis
[assumed spelling], and --

00:40:27.380 --> 00:40:28.840
oh, and Mike [assumed
spelling], over here.

00:40:28.840 --> 00:40:30.140
Yeah, Mike has a mic.

00:40:30.140 --> 00:40:33.970
So, over here first.

00:40:38.380 --> 00:40:39.680
&gt;&gt; My name is [inaudible].

00:40:39.680 --> 00:40:41.370
I teach American
politics in Tokyo.

00:40:41.370 --> 00:40:42.670
&gt;&gt; Jonathan Haidt:
Oh, very good.

00:40:42.670 --> 00:40:43.970
&gt;&gt; At [inaudible] University.

00:40:43.970 --> 00:40:45.790
This is more of a
clarification than a question.

00:40:45.790 --> 00:40:47.400
You had this political
correctness

00:40:47.400 --> 00:40:49.580
and culture wars back
in the '90s, right?

00:40:49.580 --> 00:40:52.020
So, what's different
this time around?

00:40:52.020 --> 00:40:54.350
I guess, in the '90s
was top down,

00:40:54.350 --> 00:40:55.650
and this time it's bottom up.

00:40:55.650 --> 00:40:56.950
&gt;&gt; Jonathan Haidt: That's
correct, that's right.

00:40:56.950 --> 00:40:58.250
&gt;&gt; Or, is it just --

00:40:58.250 --> 00:40:59.550
&gt;&gt; Jonathan Haidt: Well, yeah.

00:40:59.550 --> 00:41:00.850
So, good question.

00:41:00.850 --> 00:41:02.150
In the 1960's there was a huge
wave of student rebellion.

00:41:02.150 --> 00:41:03.450
[ Inaudible ]

00:41:03.450 --> 00:41:04.750
Oh, and that's right.

00:41:04.750 --> 00:41:06.050
So, the 1960's was [inaudible],

00:41:06.050 --> 00:41:07.350
and there was a lot
of violence then.

00:41:07.350 --> 00:41:09.330
I mean, you look at what
was happening on campus.

00:41:09.330 --> 00:41:10.790
There was the Kent
State massacre.

00:41:10.790 --> 00:41:13.580
So, there was -- it was much
more intense in the '60s.

00:41:13.580 --> 00:41:16.110
Then there was another wave
in the late '80s, early '90s,

00:41:16.110 --> 00:41:17.640
that was actually
more faculty driven.

00:41:17.640 --> 00:41:20.120
That was about diversifying
the cannon, the reading list.

00:41:20.120 --> 00:41:22.120
That sort of comes
out of humanities,

00:41:22.120 --> 00:41:24.690
protests against they had
too many dead white males

00:41:24.690 --> 00:41:26.100
on the syllabus.

00:41:26.100 --> 00:41:28.850
So, and then there's the new
one which started in 2014, 2015.

00:41:28.850 --> 00:41:30.150
So, you're right,
there's three waves.

00:41:30.150 --> 00:41:31.450
This is not new.

00:41:31.450 --> 00:41:34.630
What is new is the
medicalization of it.

00:41:34.630 --> 00:41:36.520
In other words, in
the previous waves,

00:41:36.520 --> 00:41:38.440
people said this is unjust.

00:41:38.440 --> 00:41:39.970
This must change.

00:41:39.970 --> 00:41:43.150
Nobody said, this
is making me sick.

00:41:43.150 --> 00:41:45.610
This is going to
damage my friends.

00:41:45.610 --> 00:41:46.910
We need protection from that.

00:41:46.910 --> 00:41:48.210
Nobody said that.

00:41:48.210 --> 00:41:49.510
That's what's new.

00:41:49.510 --> 00:41:51.550
And, so, that's what
Greg first noticed,

00:41:51.550 --> 00:41:53.150
was it's the medicalization,

00:41:53.150 --> 00:41:54.860
it's the idea that
we are fragile.

00:41:54.860 --> 00:41:57.390
We are so fragile
that we need you,

00:41:57.390 --> 00:41:59.380
the administrators,
to protect us.

00:41:59.380 --> 00:42:03.660
In the '60s what was different
was, the students were radical,

00:42:03.660 --> 00:42:04.960
but first of all,

00:42:04.960 --> 00:42:06.260
the administration
was often actually

00:42:06.260 --> 00:42:07.560
politically conservative.

00:42:07.560 --> 00:42:09.600
So, it wasn't -- the
whole campus wasn't

00:42:09.600 --> 00:42:11.010
on one page politically.

00:42:11.010 --> 00:42:14.180
So, the ideology -- there was an
ideological conflict on campus,

00:42:14.180 --> 00:42:15.480
now there's not much
of a conflict

00:42:15.480 --> 00:42:17.320
on campus, it's all on one side.

00:42:17.320 --> 00:42:19.230
And then there's
the medicalization

00:42:19.230 --> 00:42:21.550
and then there's
the social media,

00:42:21.550 --> 00:42:25.050
which allows any little thing
can blow up within hours

00:42:25.050 --> 00:42:27.400
to become a campus-wide
disaster.

00:42:27.400 --> 00:42:28.840
So, those are the
three big differences

00:42:28.840 --> 00:42:30.880
that make this situation
much, much --

00:42:30.880 --> 00:42:32.630
well, I shouldn't say worse,
because the '60s was --

00:42:32.630 --> 00:42:34.080
there was, again,
a lot of violence,

00:42:34.080 --> 00:42:35.830
but makes its this
one different.

00:42:35.830 --> 00:42:38.210
And it's what makes
this one so --

00:42:38.210 --> 00:42:40.310
it's not like this,
but it has spread.

00:42:40.310 --> 00:42:42.960
These issues are now
out in the workplace.

00:42:42.960 --> 00:42:45.230
Not all industries,
but any industry

00:42:45.230 --> 00:42:48.060
that hires creative talent
from the top universities.

00:42:48.060 --> 00:42:52.660
So, journalism, tech, media,
the arts, I hear from people

00:42:52.660 --> 00:42:53.960
in those industries,

00:42:53.960 --> 00:42:57.060
their recent hires are
doing this stuff there, too.

00:42:57.060 --> 00:43:01.320
&gt;&gt; John Haskell: Got
a gentleman over here.

00:43:01.320 --> 00:43:03.620
[ Inaudible ]

00:43:03.620 --> 00:43:07.190
Is it on?

00:43:07.190 --> 00:43:09.290
&gt;&gt; Okay, thanks.

00:43:09.290 --> 00:43:12.220
I'm wondering if you've
looked at parenting

00:43:12.220 --> 00:43:14.900
for the age group
you're describing with --

00:43:14.900 --> 00:43:16.930
for kids who have special needs?

00:43:16.930 --> 00:43:18.730
I'm just wondering
to what degree --

00:43:18.730 --> 00:43:24.310
[ Inaudible ]

00:43:24.310 --> 00:43:25.610
&gt;&gt; John Haskell: So,

00:43:25.610 --> 00:43:26.990
you're connecting what John
is talking about to kids --

00:43:26.990 --> 00:43:28.300
&gt;&gt; Jonathan Haidt: Kids
with special needs?

00:43:28.300 --> 00:43:29.600
&gt;&gt; John Haskell:
With special needs,

00:43:29.600 --> 00:43:30.900
with special needs children?

00:43:30.900 --> 00:43:32.200
[ Inaudible ]

00:43:32.200 --> 00:43:34.700
&gt;&gt; Just what the effects
are for those types of kids.

00:43:34.700 --> 00:43:36.000
&gt;&gt; Jonathan Haidt:
Yeah, that's a --

00:43:36.000 --> 00:43:37.310
that's a very good question.

00:43:37.310 --> 00:43:42.630
So, Greg, actually, I can say --
I asked him if I can say this.

00:43:42.630 --> 00:43:45.020
Greg Lukianoff, my
co-author, has dyslexia.

00:43:45.020 --> 00:43:46.740
Now, that's not exactly --

00:43:46.740 --> 00:43:49.550
that's not exactly special
needs, but what you --

00:43:49.550 --> 00:43:54.140
what you hear -- so, many
very, very successful people,

00:43:54.140 --> 00:43:57.700
most very successful people
had major setbacks, traumas,

00:43:57.700 --> 00:43:59.380
obstacles in childhood.

00:43:59.380 --> 00:44:02.770
So, depending on
how it's handled,

00:44:02.770 --> 00:44:06.120
those things could be the
thing that they overcome,

00:44:06.120 --> 00:44:09.100
and that's part of the
anti-fragility principle.

00:44:09.100 --> 00:44:12.540
I don't know how special-needs
kids are treated now.

00:44:12.540 --> 00:44:13.840
I should. That's a great point.

00:44:13.840 --> 00:44:15.590
Because if our whole point is,

00:44:15.590 --> 00:44:19.020
since the '90s we've been
massively over protecting kids,

00:44:19.020 --> 00:44:20.970
presumably we're doing it even
more for special needs kids.

00:44:20.970 --> 00:44:23.770
So, it would be fascinating to
see whether special needs kids

00:44:23.770 --> 00:44:25.390
who grew up in the
'70s or '80s ended

00:44:25.390 --> 00:44:26.950
up being much more successful,

00:44:26.950 --> 00:44:29.040
but those '90s are
overprotected.

00:44:29.040 --> 00:44:33.120
I recently came across a
concept, the dignity of risk,

00:44:33.120 --> 00:44:34.420
I think it was called.

00:44:34.420 --> 00:44:37.810
It comes at a disability
scholarship, where when you're

00:44:37.810 --> 00:44:40.410
in a protective role to a
person, say in a wheelchair,

00:44:40.410 --> 00:44:42.950
with a disability, and you
make the decision for them

00:44:42.950 --> 00:44:46.220
about what risks they can take,
you're infantilizing them,

00:44:46.220 --> 00:44:47.630
you're denying them dignity.

00:44:47.630 --> 00:44:50.410
And, so, some disability
rights activists say,

00:44:50.410 --> 00:44:52.060
let us make our own choices.

00:44:52.060 --> 00:44:53.360
Let us take some risks.

00:44:53.360 --> 00:44:55.170
You can't make all
our decisions for us.

00:44:55.170 --> 00:44:56.470
I think it's an important
concept

00:44:56.470 --> 00:44:57.950
for child rearing in general.

00:44:57.950 --> 00:45:01.040
&gt;&gt; John Haskell: We have
another [inaudible] here.

00:45:01.040 --> 00:45:05.660
So, we'll have the lady here and
then the gentleman will be next.

00:45:05.660 --> 00:45:06.960
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:45:06.960 --> 00:45:10.030
You probably, I am going to
guess, are familiar with,

00:45:10.030 --> 00:45:12.480
and I'm not going to get
his first name at all,

00:45:12.480 --> 00:45:15.900
but I believe his last
name is Louv, L O U V,

00:45:15.900 --> 00:45:18.870
who wrote a book called
Last Child in The Woods.

00:45:18.870 --> 00:45:20.170
&gt;&gt; Jonathan Haidt: Oh yeah.

00:45:20.170 --> 00:45:21.470
&gt;&gt; And about the way
that our relationship

00:45:21.470 --> 00:45:24.260
to the natural world
has changed completely,

00:45:24.260 --> 00:45:27.210
because children are not
encouraged to go out and play

00:45:27.210 --> 00:45:29.710
in nature, or close to nature,
probably not wilderness,

00:45:29.710 --> 00:45:32.920
and that the consequences
of that, it cuts us off

00:45:32.920 --> 00:45:36.680
from forming profound emotional
connections with the world

00:45:36.680 --> 00:45:40.070
in a way that we badly need if
we are going to do something

00:45:40.070 --> 00:45:41.380
about climate change,
among other things.

00:45:41.380 --> 00:45:42.680
&gt;&gt; Jonathan Haidt:
Absolutely, yes.

00:45:42.680 --> 00:45:43.980
&gt;&gt; And it seems it dovetails

00:45:43.980 --> 00:45:45.280
with what you're talking
about very nicely.

00:45:45.280 --> 00:45:46.730
&gt;&gt; Jonathan Haidt:
It absolutely does.

00:45:46.730 --> 00:45:49.410
An interesting thing about
the current phenomena

00:45:49.410 --> 00:45:51.820
that we're writing about is
that it's happening in all

00:45:51.820 --> 00:45:53.120
of the Anglosphere countries.

00:45:53.120 --> 00:45:55.770
It's not happening on
continental Europe.

00:45:55.770 --> 00:46:00.800
And one reason is that the
UK did what we did in saying,

00:46:00.800 --> 00:46:04.000
we've got to get kids learning
math earlier and earlier,

00:46:04.000 --> 00:46:06.780
whereas in Germany,
Switzerland, Scandinavia,

00:46:06.780 --> 00:46:08.080
they send the kids out.

00:46:08.080 --> 00:46:09.500
I know they do this in
Switzerland and Germany,

00:46:09.500 --> 00:46:12.950
at four the kids are -- one of
the main activities is, okay,

00:46:12.950 --> 00:46:14.390
we're going out into the woods,

00:46:14.390 --> 00:46:16.530
and they might even
have a hatchet or a saw.

00:46:16.530 --> 00:46:19.390
Let's make a fire, you
know, with five-year-olds.

00:46:19.390 --> 00:46:21.910
And it may happen that
a kid gets burned.

00:46:21.910 --> 00:46:23.210
That might happen.

00:46:23.210 --> 00:46:24.510
And then guess what?

00:46:24.510 --> 00:46:25.810
They learn.

00:46:25.810 --> 00:46:27.110
They learn.

00:46:27.110 --> 00:46:28.410
So, there's this great
thing on Staten Island --

00:46:28.410 --> 00:46:31.110
Governors Island in New York
called the Junkyard Playground

00:46:31.110 --> 00:46:34.210
where I had to sign like a
huge several page release

00:46:34.210 --> 00:46:38.410
to let my kids in, but there's
hammers and nails and lumber

00:46:38.410 --> 00:46:39.710
and kids could get hurt.

00:46:39.710 --> 00:46:42.440
And I watched, and
they sometimes do.

00:46:42.440 --> 00:46:45.740
Like I watched a kid pounding
a nail and he hit his thumb,

00:46:45.740 --> 00:46:47.180
and he didn't go
running off crying.

00:46:47.180 --> 00:46:49.890
Just went like this, owe, and
he picked up the nail again

00:46:49.890 --> 00:46:51.230
and he kept going
and did it again.

00:46:51.230 --> 00:46:53.590
And by the third
time, he learned how

00:46:53.590 --> 00:46:55.090
to -- how to pound a nail.

00:46:55.090 --> 00:46:57.520
So, kids get experience
in nature.

00:46:57.520 --> 00:46:59.390
Kids always have.

00:46:59.390 --> 00:47:04.300
Because we got this crazy
idea in our heads in the '80s

00:47:04.300 --> 00:47:07.700
that if the kid is unsupervised,
if no adult is watching,

00:47:07.700 --> 00:47:10.390
that kid will be abducted
by a sexual predator.

00:47:10.390 --> 00:47:12.930
That kid will be -- or,
that kid will be abducted.

00:47:12.930 --> 00:47:14.690
We got this idea
because of cable TV.

00:47:14.690 --> 00:47:16.190
We freaked out in the '80s.

00:47:16.190 --> 00:47:18.060
By the '90s we stopped
letting kids out.

00:47:18.060 --> 00:47:20.280
And the two most
dangerous places

00:47:20.280 --> 00:47:22.420
that we would never let our
kids go are public restrooms

00:47:22.420 --> 00:47:23.720
and the woods.

00:47:23.720 --> 00:47:25.020
We would never let our kids
go to those two places,

00:47:25.020 --> 00:47:26.590
because who knows what
will happen to them there,

00:47:26.590 --> 00:47:29.460
and it's a real shame for
exactly the reasons you say.

00:47:29.460 --> 00:47:31.700
And, so, this is one of things
I'm hopeful about, that,

00:47:31.700 --> 00:47:35.550
you know, so many people are
recognizing like nature is good.

00:47:35.550 --> 00:47:36.850
We have to let kids out into it.

00:47:36.850 --> 00:47:38.500
And, so, I think if we can --

00:47:38.500 --> 00:47:40.400
it's scary to let
your kid out alone,

00:47:40.400 --> 00:47:42.210
but if schools start
letting them out,

00:47:42.210 --> 00:47:45.050
if parents get together and
make an effort, I think --

00:47:45.050 --> 00:47:46.760
I think we can reclaim
the woods.

00:47:46.760 --> 00:47:49.570
&gt;&gt; John Haskell:
This fellow here.

00:47:51.890 --> 00:47:54.470
&gt;&gt; Do you have any thoughts
on, what if colleges went

00:47:54.470 --> 00:47:57.700
to a more open admissions
sort of arrangements,

00:47:57.700 --> 00:48:00.570
what might that do to, for
example, high school kids

00:48:00.570 --> 00:48:05.580
who now are under such pressure,
they might be able to, you know,

00:48:05.580 --> 00:48:08.360
enjoy life a little bit more
and not have such pressure

00:48:08.360 --> 00:48:10.390
when they're in high school,
and then when they get

00:48:10.390 --> 00:48:14.370
to get college maybe you'd have
a more diverse, more inclusive,

00:48:14.370 --> 00:48:18.280
more -- less inequality?

00:48:18.280 --> 00:48:21.060
&gt;&gt; Jonathan Haidt: Yeah, so,
in America I think it would --

00:48:21.060 --> 00:48:24.270
we'd never go to a totally
open admissions policy.

00:48:24.270 --> 00:48:27.030
We do -- we are committed
in some ways to some kinds

00:48:27.030 --> 00:48:30.720
of meritocracy, but our
meritocracy has gotten too much

00:48:30.720 --> 00:48:33.070
test based, and that
is a problem.

00:48:33.070 --> 00:48:35.110
We reward people for
the kind of intelligence

00:48:35.110 --> 00:48:36.510
that does well on tests.

00:48:36.510 --> 00:48:38.640
And then there's a wonderful
column by Ivan Krastev,

00:48:38.640 --> 00:48:39.940
who's actually a fellow here

00:48:39.940 --> 00:48:41.680
in the New York Times
two years ago,

00:48:41.680 --> 00:48:45.960
about how the really twisted
thing about our meritocracy is

00:48:45.960 --> 00:48:47.750
that we reward people for
doing well on the test,

00:48:47.750 --> 00:48:49.390
and then they believe
they deserved it

00:48:49.390 --> 00:48:51.030
because they did
well on the test.

00:48:51.030 --> 00:48:52.330
So, there are problems.

00:48:52.330 --> 00:48:55.010
And there are some
interesting proposals to say

00:48:55.010 --> 00:48:57.860
above a certain level of
grades and test scores,

00:48:57.860 --> 00:49:00.300
above that we do it randomly.

00:49:00.300 --> 00:49:01.600
Those would be hard
to implement,

00:49:01.600 --> 00:49:03.280
but those might do some good.

00:49:03.280 --> 00:49:04.660
I would rather we
go another way.

00:49:04.660 --> 00:49:06.190
The problem you're
trying to address is

00:49:06.190 --> 00:49:09.650
that kids are pressured so
much to succeed, middle-class,

00:49:09.650 --> 00:49:11.490
upper-middle-class kids
[inaudible] so much pressure,

00:49:11.490 --> 00:49:13.450
there's no time for play.

00:49:13.450 --> 00:49:16.990
What we suggest in the
book is that we should --

00:49:16.990 --> 00:49:18.290
we should accept the fact

00:49:18.290 --> 00:49:21.030
that 18-year-olds should
not be on college campuses.

00:49:21.030 --> 00:49:23.210
Eighteen-year-olds today,
as Jean Twenge puts it,

00:49:23.210 --> 00:49:25.650
showing the data, an 18-year-old
today is about the same

00:49:25.650 --> 00:49:28.000
as a 15-year-old
from 30 years ago.

00:49:28.000 --> 00:49:30.390
Eighteen-year-olds, American
18-year-olds are generally --

00:49:30.390 --> 00:49:32.010
some of them are
certainly ready,

00:49:32.010 --> 00:49:35.200
but a lot of them are just not
ready to be on a college campus.

00:49:35.200 --> 00:49:37.870
And when we bring them to
college campuses, they end up --

00:49:37.870 --> 00:49:42.130
many of them end up requesting
infantilizing procedures,

00:49:42.130 --> 00:49:45.410
which then damages everything
else for everyone else.

00:49:45.410 --> 00:49:50.680
What if the top schools all
say, we strongly favor people

00:49:50.680 --> 00:49:53.880
who have taken a year or
two off, had a gap year,

00:49:53.880 --> 00:49:56.570
done military service, lived
somewhere else in the country.

00:49:56.570 --> 00:49:59.420
We think a red, blue switch,
like if you're from a blue area,

00:49:59.420 --> 00:50:02.080
go get a job in a red area,
or vice versa, meet people.

00:50:02.080 --> 00:50:05.060
We've got to get kids
away from their parents.

00:50:05.060 --> 00:50:07.320
Now, boarding school
might seem like a way,

00:50:07.320 --> 00:50:08.660
and I need to do
research on this,

00:50:08.660 --> 00:50:10.530
boarding school also
infantilizes

00:50:10.530 --> 00:50:12.130
and teaches some bad
habit, some of them.

00:50:12.130 --> 00:50:14.710
I don't know enough to
comment on all of them.

00:50:14.710 --> 00:50:18.020
But if colleges, if Harvard
and Yale start saying,

00:50:18.020 --> 00:50:19.630
we're not going to
get the, you know,

00:50:19.630 --> 00:50:21.960
the person who did 12
extracurriculars in addition

00:50:21.960 --> 00:50:24.180
to double 800's on the
SAT, we're not going

00:50:24.180 --> 00:50:25.480
for that person anymore.

00:50:25.480 --> 00:50:28.440
We're going to favor military
veterans, people who went off

00:50:28.440 --> 00:50:30.540
and did something for a
couple years, and we're going

00:50:30.540 --> 00:50:32.670
to favor people who
are 19 or 20 years old.

00:50:32.670 --> 00:50:34.050
That would be a better
way, I think,

00:50:34.050 --> 00:50:35.590
to take the pressure off kids,

00:50:35.590 --> 00:50:40.900
to make parents stop pressuring
their kids to achieve, achieve,

00:50:40.900 --> 00:50:43.190
achieve for your resume.

00:50:43.190 --> 00:50:44.890
&gt;&gt; So, we're going to wrap
up the conversation there.
