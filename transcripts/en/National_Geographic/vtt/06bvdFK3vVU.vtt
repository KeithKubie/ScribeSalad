00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:04.290
you think that with the beautiful
photographs that we have of our round

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:08.760
blue planet it would convince any
doubters but there are still some who

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:12.870
insist that the world is flat
correspondent Mariana van Zeller

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:17.000
discovers more about this fast growing
movement in California

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:39.510
I'm Mariana van Zeller and I'm in Southern California to
look into a growing movement in America

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:44.010
people who claim the earth is flat they
call themselves the flat earthers and

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:47.910
we're here to try to understand what's
behind this unconventional view and how

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:51.230
it can affect the rest of us

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:58.160
so what's happening here today why are
you here this matters to me

00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:04.910
flattered that shows you that you are
not a mistake and you were created and

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:11.120
so you have meaning in matter - we're
not monkeys floating through space on

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:16.580
the false maxim that testable it's not
measurable it's not provable it's not

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:21.410
real how old are you guys just out of
curiosity do you think it's a growing

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:25.220
movement yes and we're networking and
getting stronger people are realizing it

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:28.220
it's coming out in the media you're
hearing the term flatter this is

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:31.970
becoming more normal people are more
open-minded to it he's not wrong a

00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:36.790
recent survey of Americans found that
two percent believe the earth is flat

00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:42.649
for the US population as a whole
that works out to be over 6.5 million

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:46.520
people
even high profile artists and athletes

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:49.930
are getting on board

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:54.080
I want to try to find Mart sergeant
who's one of the leaders of the Flat

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:58.850
Earth community
nice to see you man mark used to design

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:04.250
video games and run software trainings
now he devotes himself full-time to

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:10.369
promoting the Flat Earth with all the
attention that you must be Mark Sargent

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:13.220
I am Mark Sargent
thanks for meeting us here it's a

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:19.760
pleasure to be here so tell me what is
this movement all about this movement is

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:26.510
about changing the world literally you
think for the longest time that you live

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:34.670
here but what if it wasn't this what if
this was just the illusion yeah we're

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:48.709
gonna open this thing up and the reality
look something like this in a nutshell

00:02:48.709 --> 00:02:54.290
you have North Pole at the centre the
continents splayed out organically on

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:58.040
the sides
Antarctica is stretched around the

00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:03.590
entire outer edge like an ice ball the
Sun in the morning are very very small

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:11.090
and the stars are just lights in the sky
a giant planet area which means is built

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:15.620
by somebody someone bigger than us
someone better than us do you think it

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:24.079
was a god not my place to say your
belief in the earth being flat flies in

00:03:24.079 --> 00:03:36.489
the face hundreds of the world not only
that we have satellite imagery we have

00:03:36.489 --> 00:03:48.260
photos from space and nobody here
believes any of that anymore so you

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:51.470
don't believe that people travel in
space no oh it's much worse than you

00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:57.500
know meaning the only reason NASA was
founded in 1958 was to keep this thing

00:03:57.500 --> 00:04:02.479
under wraps as best they could be big
think of the shockwaves if all of a

00:04:02.479 --> 00:04:06.040
sudden you're telling a civilization
that this model this is an it anymore

00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:17.840
flatters is the last conspiracy anyone
ever looks at mark and his fellow flat

00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:22.310
earther seem to be pretty convinced that
the earth is flat and that we've all

00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:26.840
been lied to for all these years but I'm
interested in knowing what impact this

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:32.090
might have not only for science but for
society at large so we're heading to

00:04:32.090 --> 00:04:37.550
meet with an astrophysicist that we hope
can answer some of these questions the

00:04:37.550 --> 00:04:41.659
universe began about fourteen billion
years ago an event that we call the Big

00:04:41.659 --> 00:04:46.250
Bang james bullock is a professor of
physics and astronomy at the University

00:04:46.250 --> 00:04:52.880
of California Irvine he specializes in
how galaxies formed did you ever think a

00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:56.659
few years ago that you'd be having this
discussion for National Geographic it's

00:04:56.659 --> 00:05:01.310
frankly shocking we've known for 2,000
years based on observations you can make

00:05:01.310 --> 00:05:04.349
with your own eyes that the world is
round

00:05:04.349 --> 00:05:07.229
they have all the evidence right in
front of them and they still choose not

00:05:07.229 --> 00:05:11.129
to believe in it you know who knows what
motivates people from the inside to

00:05:11.129 --> 00:05:15.930
believe these things but science is
important science is valuable science

00:05:15.930 --> 00:05:19.860
saves lives it makes our lives better
and more comfortable and it enriches us

00:05:19.860 --> 00:05:23.879
intellectually and to question what
scientists are saying and suggested

00:05:23.879 --> 00:05:27.449
they're part of some massive
international global conspiracy it's

00:05:27.449 --> 00:05:31.830
really scary are they a threat to the
work that you do as a scientist if say

00:05:31.830 --> 00:05:36.419
government stop funding science the
cause of some kind of anti science anti

00:05:36.419 --> 00:05:40.649
intellectual feedback they're getting
from the populace that's when it really

00:05:40.649 --> 00:05:47.069
starts getting dangerous for our
civilization and as the war on science

00:05:47.069 --> 00:05:53.309
heats up some Americans are fighting
back we're heading to the largest lake

00:05:53.309 --> 00:05:58.319
in California to meet the independent
investigations group which is a group

00:05:58.319 --> 00:06:03.419
that essentially debunks paranormal
claims and they want to do a round earth

00:06:03.419 --> 00:06:07.800
task may that be a test that will prove
that the earth is not flat but that it

00:06:07.800 --> 00:06:13.919
is round let's go we're ready to launch
you ready Craig ok so what's happening

00:06:13.919 --> 00:06:17.550
here right now okay this is the boat
base target it's horizontal stripes

00:06:17.550 --> 00:06:25.279
we're gonna launch a small boat out into
the water here with a striped target

00:06:26.030 --> 00:06:31.850
and as it gets farther and farther out
you'll start to lose the stripes one way

00:06:31.850 --> 00:06:36.680
that Aristotle proved 2,000 years ago
that the earth is a sphere was with a

00:06:36.680 --> 00:06:43.460
boat's test very similar to this one as
a boat approaches the horizon it appears

00:06:43.460 --> 00:06:48.440
to slowly dip down into the water before
disappearing completely that's got

00:06:48.440 --> 00:06:53.030
everything to do with the curvature of
the earth if the planet was flat the

00:06:53.030 --> 00:07:00.770
entire boat would remain visible so
it'll be a very visual depiction of the

00:07:00.770 --> 00:07:05.630
curvature of the earth and what's really
interesting is that some of the flat

00:07:05.630 --> 00:07:09.500
earthers including mark sergeant's are
actually going to be here for this test

00:07:09.500 --> 00:07:13.220
they want to see it for themselves what
do you think is gonna happen here today

00:07:13.220 --> 00:07:17.320
I appreciate the scientific group coming
out and trying to do this test great

00:07:17.320 --> 00:07:27.169
appreciate the enthusiasm but cannot
work can't work yeah okay so the test is

00:07:27.169 --> 00:07:32.120
starting the test it's starting right
now at first all the stripes are clearly

00:07:32.120 --> 00:07:37.310
visible but sure enough as the boat
reaches the horizon the stripes begin to

00:07:37.310 --> 00:07:42.590
disappear one by one it's pretty amazing
you can actually see it really clearly

00:07:42.590 --> 00:07:46.820
with this camera here and you see that
the red stripe cuz that was at the

00:07:46.820 --> 00:07:50.570
bottom has completely disappeared and
it's now getting closer to sort of the

00:07:50.570 --> 00:07:54.670
middle
Green we've lost about one and a half

00:07:54.670 --> 00:08:01.170
stripes so this can only happen white
because of the curvature of the earth

00:08:02.310 --> 00:08:05.260
but mark Sargent and the other
flat-earthers

00:08:05.260 --> 00:08:10.090
have a very different interpretation of
the results so you don't think that what

00:08:10.090 --> 00:08:16.510
we're seeing is actually real you think
it's because oh yeah here in flat earth

00:08:16.510 --> 00:08:26.440
believe it's a globe mister
demonstration that doesn't change anyone

00:08:26.440 --> 00:08:30.430
Korea Lord no mark do you really believe
this stuff tell me the truth

00:08:30.430 --> 00:08:35.710
I'm serious right absolutely 100%
believe we are not on a globe we are

00:08:35.710 --> 00:08:41.620
part of a giant studio set all the
world's a stage and you're on it I still

00:08:41.620 --> 00:08:44.560
don't understand that like who's gaining
from all this from this larger exclusive

00:08:44.560 --> 00:08:50.650
the highest authority higher than
presidents this super-rich people that

00:08:50.650 --> 00:08:54.010
are behind the scenes remember the first
rule of powers stay hidden so this is

00:08:54.010 --> 00:08:57.250
for me where I think it gets really
dangerous because we're going back into

00:08:57.250 --> 00:09:01.660
the dark ages all right you're
essentially perpetuating ignorance by

00:09:01.660 --> 00:09:05.680
denying science you know there's a
real-life implication in all of this

00:09:05.680 --> 00:09:10.960
science has had its chance and they
aren't putting up a defense I think that

00:09:10.960 --> 00:09:16.480
the flat earth could potentially uh sure
in a new golden age or it could assure

00:09:16.480 --> 00:09:19.620
in an age of chaos

00:09:22.690 --> 00:09:30.020
it's easy to dismiss this as just a
silly theory and unimportant but the

00:09:30.020 --> 00:09:34.490
problem is that is a growing movement in
America more and more young people seem

00:09:34.490 --> 00:09:39.380
to believe that the world is flat and
you know it's more than just distrust

00:09:39.380 --> 00:09:44.480
and government it's this notion that
thousands of years of empirical

00:09:44.480 --> 00:09:48.680
scientific evidence is now being
dismissed as a mere conspiracy and

00:09:48.680 --> 00:09:54.790
that's where I think it really starts
getting dangerous for all of us
