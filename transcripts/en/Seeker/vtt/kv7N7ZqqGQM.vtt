00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:09.370
If you want to break a world record, it might
be easier to just invent your own sport.

00:00:09.370 --> 00:00:11.370
Hello winners, Julian here for DNews.

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:14.549
It’s that time again for the quadrennial
summer games.

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:18.260
Top athletes from around the world have gathered
in Rio to compete for gold.

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:21.939
And while a gold medal would prove they are
the current best, a world record would prove

00:00:21.939 --> 00:00:23.310
they are the best ever.

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:27.539
There’s just one problem: world records
are getting harder to break.

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:31.600
For example, in July 2016, Kendra Harrison
of the United States broke a record for the

00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:35.030
100m hurdles that had stood for 28 years.

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:38.800
The longer a sport’s been around, the harder
the records are to break. Men have been running

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:44.030
marathons since the modern games were revived
in 1896, and since 1984 the world record has

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:46.300
been trimmed down by only 5 minutes.

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:51.039
Women on the other hand couldn’t compete
in marathons until 1984, and since then they’ve

00:00:51.039 --> 00:00:53.370
lopped 10 minutes off the world record time.

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:57.520
The difference can be explained by a branch
of mathematics called extreme-value statistics,

00:00:57.520 --> 00:01:00.949
which seeks to predict the likelihood of large
deviations from the mean.

00:01:00.949 --> 00:01:05.630
According to extreme-value statistics, over
time the rate athletes set new records slows

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:07.390
as the sample size grows.

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:11.381
More athletes competing means an extreme outlier
is probably in the bunch, so after over a

00:01:11.381 --> 00:01:16.250
hundred years some events like track-and-field
have probably seen the best athletes possible.

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:21.050
Take Great Britain’s Colin Jackson, holder
for the 60 meter hurdles record since 1994.

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:23.740
He has an abundance of super-fast twitch muscles.

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:27.440
These muscles turn glucose into bursts of
speed and are ideal for sprinters.

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:33.150
Jackson’s muscles were 25% super-fast twitch,
putting him in the top 2% of the population.

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:36.880
Jackson and athletes like him have won the
genetic lottery, but surely there must be

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:39.230
a point when the human body can do no better.

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:42.630
Some scientists, like Peter Weyand of Southern
Methodist University, have attempted to figure

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:46.720
out where that limit is and concluded that
the human body can handle forces that would

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:49.650
propel a sprinter to 60 kilometers per hour.

00:01:49.650 --> 00:01:55.440
By comparison the fastest sprinter yet, Jamaica’s
Usain Bolt, can only manage a measly 45 kilometers

00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:56.440
per hour.

00:01:56.440 --> 00:02:00.280
So Weyand is pretty optimistic, but researcher
Mark Denny out of Stanford hasn’t set the

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:01.400
bar as high.

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:05.670
Denny compared the historical trends of human
racers to two species purpose bred for speed

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:10.610
-dogs and thoroughbred horses- and assuming
we follow the same trends as these two animals,

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:16.670
he concluded that the best possible time for
the 100m dash is 9.48 seconds, just 0.1 seconds

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:19.260
quicker than Bolt’s current record.

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:22.200
Athletes don’t exist in a vacuum though,
and a lot more goes into making a world record

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:24.200
than raw athletic ability.

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:27.950
Training techniques and equipment play a huge
role, and this is where advances in science

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:30.030
can propel athletes to new heights.

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:33.390
Like when pole vaulters swapped out their
aluminum poles for fiberglass ones, they broke

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:35.500
more records than a monkey in a music store.

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:39.290
The same happened when cyclists jumped onto
carbon fiber bikes, or when swimmers compressed

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:43.570
themselves into ultra-hydrodynamic body suits
in Beijing in 2008.

00:02:43.570 --> 00:02:48.230
21 of the 22 records set in swimming that
year were attributed to the body suit, and

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:51.210
they were subsequently banned for having too
much of an impact.

00:02:51.210 --> 00:02:54.120
Even if they’re not wearing it, technology
helps athletes.

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:57.350
Swimmers train using motion capture to analyze
their movements, and their techniques are

00:02:57.350 --> 00:02:59.700
tweaked to get the most out of their bodies.

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:03.490
Advances in nutrition and training have taken
the best natural athletes of our species and

00:03:03.490 --> 00:03:05.569
turned them into well-fed machines.

00:03:05.569 --> 00:03:09.481
Of course it’s possible to abuse advances
in science to gain an unfair edge, like with

00:03:09.481 --> 00:03:11.150
blood doping or steroid use.

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:15.710
There’s even talk of using CRISPR to genetically
engineer top tier competitors.

00:03:15.710 --> 00:03:19.930
With human ability as close to its maximum
as it’s likely to get, breaking world records

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:23.810
may come down to where we draw the line on
science and technology.

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:27.209
Sometimes the planets align and amazing sports
moments happen.

00:03:27.209 --> 00:03:31.150
Other times the ref totally robs you.

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:43.449
 

00:03:43.459 --> 00:03:51.280
Do you think technological advances like the
super swimsuit are fair?
