00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:06.720 align:start position:0%
show the mercy and she'll act
 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:08.090 align:start position:0%
show the mercy and she'll act

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:08.100 align:start position:0%
differently and stuff like that that it
 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:10.399 align:start position:0%
differently and stuff like that that it
made<00:01:08.369><c> sense</c><00:01:08.760><c> for</c><00:01:08.909><c> them</c><00:01:09.119><c> not</c><00:01:09.390><c> to</c><00:01:09.450><c> tell</c><00:01:09.960><c> her</c><00:01:10.229><c> and</c>

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:10.409 align:start position:0%
made sense for them not to tell her and
 

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:12.230 align:start position:0%
made sense for them not to tell her and
that's<00:01:10.860><c> why</c><00:01:11.100><c> I</c><00:01:11.130><c> think</c><00:01:11.310><c> this</c><00:01:11.549><c> film</c><00:01:11.729><c> works</c><00:01:11.970><c> so</c>

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:12.240 align:start position:0%
that's why I think this film works so
 

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:13.760 align:start position:0%
that's why I think this film works so
good<00:01:12.420><c> is</c><00:01:12.600><c> that</c><00:01:12.630><c> the</c><00:01:12.869><c> twist</c><00:01:13.260><c> at</c><00:01:13.409><c> the</c><00:01:13.439><c> end</c><00:01:13.530><c> is</c>

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:13.770 align:start position:0%
good is that the twist at the end is
 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:16.820 align:start position:0%
good is that the twist at the end is
100%<00:01:14.630><c> justified</c><00:01:15.630><c> that</c><00:01:16.290><c> the</c><00:01:16.530><c> Hunger</c><00:01:16.799><c> Games</c>
