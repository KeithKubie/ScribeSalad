00:00:07.210 --> 00:00:09.770
Some film roles can be harder to tackle than
others.

00:00:09.770 --> 00:00:14.690
So hard, that once the actor or actress has
found it, there's no way to be anything but

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:16.330
the character they're playing.

00:00:16.330 --> 00:00:20.160
That can usually result in a more powerful
performance - but it doesn't mean it's easy

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:22.320
on their co-stars, or the crew behind the
scenes.

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:27.529
Here are Screen Rant's 10 Method Actors Who
Refused to Break Character.

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:32.099
Meryl Streep
It was intimidating enough for Anne Hathaway

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:36.040
to share the screen with Meryl Streep in The
Devil Wears Prada, but the Oscar winner approached

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:39.420
the young actress on their very first day
of shooting, telling her she was perfect for

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:40.559
the role.

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:43.710
She then added that was the last time she
would be nice to her.

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:46.350
And it was.

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:50.570
It wasn't until promoting the film months
later that Hathaway actually got to meet the

00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:56.390
actress, &nbsp;instead of the cold fashion icon
she played in the film.

00:00:56.390 --> 00:01:00.199
Joaquin Phoenix
When it comes to playing an actual celebrity

00:01:00.199 --> 00:01:04.760
in a dramatic biopic, losing yourself in the
source material is almost always the way to

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:05.760
go.

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:08.830
So when Joaquin Phoenix refused to lip sync,
instead learning to play guitar and sing just

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:16.829
like Johnny Cash in Walk The Line, he took
the extra step of playing the part between

00:01:16.829 --> 00:01:20.420
takes, asking cast and crew to refer to him
by his character's name.

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:24.700
He would later say he felt like an idiot for
the demand, but at the time, hearing someone

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:30.850
call for "Joaquin" didn't feel right - and
it's actually easy to see what he meant.

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:34.450
Tom Hardy
Not every actor could have made a real character

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:39.050
out of the grunting, shifty-eyed Max in Fury
Road, but Tom Hardy made his handful of lines

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:42.479
and frantic gestures count - even between
takes.

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:46.700
During filming, reports surfaced that Hardy
wasn't easy to work with, remaining in character,

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:51.530
muttering to himself and not engaging in conversation
with his co-stars or director.

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:56.110
But it's hard to argue with any of the results.

00:01:56.110 --> 00:02:00.800
Jim Carrey
You might think that the weird and wacky actor

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:04.899
isn't too different from the characters he
plays, but for the Andy Kauffman biopic Man

00:02:04.899 --> 00:02:08.399
on The Moon, Jim Carrey lost himself in the
strange comedian completely.

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:13.190
He portrayed Kauffman and his alter ego, Tony
Clifton, the entire time the film was being

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:14.190
shot.

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:18.380
The cameras rolled as he did, capturing over
200 hours of Carrey ambushing crew members

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:23.010
and extras, with some of it making it into
the finished film.

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:27.660
Adam Driver
Sometimes, pain or discomfort experienced

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:31.390
during filming is just what's needed to get
an actor to the right place and attitude for

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:32.390
the role.

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:36.440
For Star Wars: the Force Awakens, it was the
vision-obscuring mask of Kylo Ren that actor

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:37.920
Adam Driver had troubles with.

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:41.660
He joked that the cast was a mystery even
to him, since he couldn't seen any of them

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:45.370
during filming, but he stayed in character
throughout most of the shoot.

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:49.900
That meant keeping the helmet on between scenes,
using the confusion and isolation feed his

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:52.710
character.

00:02:52.710 --> 00:02:56.190
Robert Downey, Jr.

00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:59.900
It's still hard to believe that Robert Downey,
Jr.'s role as Kirk Lazarus in Tropic Thunder

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:04.170
got him an Oscar nomination, but you can't
say he wasn't committed to the part.

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:08.590
Apparently, he remained in character as Lazarus
-- or, as the actor Lazarus, in character

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:12.980
as Staff Sergeant Lincloln Osiris - during
the entire shoot.

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:18.150
And just as Lazarus claimed he didn't drop
character until after the DVD commentary,

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:25.290
neither does Downey, recording it as Lazarus
AND Osiris, the role within a role.&nbsp;

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:29.190
Christian Bale
He's known for staying in almost every character

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:34.060
he plays, but for his major American debut
in Batman Begins, Christian Bale went a step

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:35.060
further.

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:38.540
Aside from having his trailer labelled as
"Bruce Wayne's," he took his American accent

00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:41.950
and personality all the way through press
interview and promotion for the film.

00:03:41.950 --> 00:03:46.390
Even fans who had watched hours of the Welsh
actor discussing the part had no idea that

00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:50.510
he wasn't an American - which may have helped
win over fans of the Gotham playboy from the

00:03:50.510 --> 00:03:52.400
start.

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:57.150
Jared Leto
His on set antics as the Suicide Squad's Joker

00:03:57.150 --> 00:04:02.090
got plenty of headlines, but Jared Leto was
losing himself in roles long before.

00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:06.290
Leaving behind the character of Rayon in The
Dallas Buyer's Club wasn't easy, having lost

00:04:06.290 --> 00:04:08.760
30 pounds and waxed his entire body.

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:12.880
So Leto remained in character in all aspects
of his life while shooting, with the director

00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:18.230
even admitting that he didn't know Jared Leto,
only the character he played.

00:04:18.230 --> 00:04:23.150
Tom Hanks
He isn't known for his method acting, but

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:27.360
when playing the star prison guard of The
Green Mile, Tom Hanks felt some extra dedication

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:28.360
was needed.

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:31.889
When Stephen King visited the set to see the
movie based on his own novel, Hanks felt it

00:04:31.889 --> 00:04:34.620
was a compliment to remain in the character
King had created.

00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:38.300
Giving the author a tour of the prison, he
even refused when King asked fi he wanted

00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:42.240
to take a turn sitting in the prop electric
chair, explaining that the head of the wing

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:46.860
shouldn't be seen playing around by the guards
looking up to him.

00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:52.039
Daniel Day-Lewis AND Sally Field
How about a two-for-one?

00:04:52.039 --> 00:04:56.129
Daniel Day-Lewis is famous for his extreme
method acting, but he met his match with Sally

00:04:56.129 --> 00:05:00.710
Field, the Mary Todd to his Abraham Lincoln
in the Steven Spielberg biopic.

00:05:00.710 --> 00:05:04.699
Field turned inward into the role, texting
her co-star using the language of the time,

00:05:04.699 --> 00:05:12.871
with Day-Lewis going one step further, retaining
his American accent while on set, and even

00:05:12.871 --> 00:05:16.490
signing his texts as the former President.

00:05:16.490 --> 00:05:20.060
Those are the cases of actors refusing to
break character that we think movie fans should

00:05:20.060 --> 00:05:22.090
know about, but what are some of your favorites?
