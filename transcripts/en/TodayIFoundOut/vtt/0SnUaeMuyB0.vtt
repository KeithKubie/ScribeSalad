00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:37.670
Since the early 1970s conspiracy theorists
have created ever more elaborate stories about

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:43.670
how NASA faked the moon landings, much to
the annoyance of the literal hundreds of thousands

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:49.630
of people who worked in some capacity to make
these missions a reality, and even more so

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:53.991
to the men who were brave enough to sit in
front of a massive controlled explosion, take

00:01:53.991 --> 00:01:59.780
a little jaunt through the soul crushing void
of space in an extremely complex ship built

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:04.650
by the lowest bidder, then get into another
spacecraft whose ascent engine had never been

00:02:04.650 --> 00:02:10.540
test fired before they lit the candle, and
all with the goal of exiting said ship with

00:02:10.540 --> 00:02:13.410
only a special suit between them and oblivion.

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:18.270
And don't even get the astronauts started
on the paltry government salary they earned

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:22.930
in doing all that and the hilarious lengths
they had to go to to provide some semblance

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:27.630
of a life insurance policy for their families
should the worst happen during the missions.

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:31.930
So who first got the idea that the moon landings
were faked?

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:36.570
While it's highly likely there were at least
a few individuals here and there who doubted

00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:41.050
man could accomplish such a thing a little
over a half century after the end of period

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:46.051
in which humans were still hitching up covered
wagons, the first to really get the moon landing

00:02:46.051 --> 00:02:50.600
hoax story going popularly was a writer named
Bill Kaysing.

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:52.030
How did he do it?

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:57.370
Kaysing self-published a book in 1976 called
We Never Went to the Moon: America's Thirty

00:02:57.370 --> 00:02:59.200
Billion Dollar Swindle.

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:04.690
Released a few years after the Apollo 17 mission
in 1972, Kaysing’s book popularly introduced

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:08.860
some of the most well known talking points
of moon landing deniers, such as that the

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:13.360
astronauts should have been killed when they
passed through the Van Allen radiation belts,

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:18.010
noting the lack of stars in photographs, the
missing blast crater below the lunar modules,

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:19.010
etc.

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:24.310
Beyond these, he also had some more, let's
say, "unusual" and occasionally offensive

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:29.790
assertions which even the most ardent moon
landing denier would probably rather distance

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:30.950
themselves from.

00:03:30.950 --> 00:03:35.420
Not exactly a best-seller, Kaysing's book
nonetheless laid the ground work for some

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:40.709
of what would come after, with the idea further
gaining steam in part thanks to the 1978 film

00:03:40.709 --> 00:03:46.880
Capricorn 1, which shows NASA faking a Mars
landing and then going to any lengths to keep

00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:47.880
it a secret.

00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:52.120
As for the film, director Peter Hyams states
he first got the idea for such a movie when

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:57.020
musing over the Apollo 11 mission and thinking,
"There was one event of really enormous importance

00:03:57.020 --> 00:03:59.130
that had almost no witnesses.

00:03:59.130 --> 00:04:02.799
And the only verification we have . . . came
from a TV camera."

00:04:02.799 --> 00:04:06.730
Not an accurate statement in the slightest
on the latter point, it nonetheless got the

00:04:06.730 --> 00:04:11.730
wheels turning and he ultimately developed
a script based on this notion.

00:04:11.730 --> 00:04:15.620
As to how Kaysing before him came to the conclusion
that NASA faked the moon landings, the story,

00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:20.079
at least as Kaysing tells it, is that in the
late 1950s he managed to view the results

00:04:20.079 --> 00:04:25.790
of a highly secretive internal study conducted
by NASA on the feasibility of man successfully

00:04:25.790 --> 00:04:30.270
landing on the moon that concluded, in his
own words: “That the chance of success was

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:32.200
something like .0017 percent.

00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:36.250
In other words, it was hopeless.”

00:04:36.250 --> 00:04:40.960
Kaysing doesn't explain how NASA came up with
such a precise figure given all the unknown

00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:45.550
variables at the time, nor why he put the
qualifier "something like" followed by such

00:04:45.550 --> 00:04:47.560
an extremely exact number.

00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:49.600
He also did not name the report itself.

00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:54.490
And, in fact, as far as we can tell, NASA
never conducted such an all encompassing study

00:04:54.490 --> 00:04:58.520
on the feasibility of a successful moon landing
in the 1950s.

00:04:58.520 --> 00:05:02.540
Whether they did or not, we did find in our
research looking for that report that NASA

00:05:02.540 --> 00:05:07.560
conducted a feasibility study on the proposed
designs for several manned rockets immediately

00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:11.890
prior to Apollo program to decide which contractor
to use.

00:05:11.890 --> 00:05:15.970
This, of course, has nothing to do with Kaysing,
but we figured we’d mention it as we like

00:05:15.970 --> 00:05:21.660
to deal in facts and reading Kaysing's various
works has us feeling like we need to be cleansed

00:05:21.660 --> 00:05:25.192
a little by saying things that are actually
true about NASA in this period.

00:05:25.192 --> 00:05:29.860
In any event, Kaysing would later assert that
he determined from this report that there’s

00:05:29.860 --> 00:05:36.430
no way NASA could have improved these 0.0017%
odds in the time between the results of this

00:05:36.430 --> 00:05:40.970
supposed study and the moon landings about
a decade later.

00:05:40.970 --> 00:05:46.241
Now, if Kaysing was just some random guy shouting
in the wind, it's unlikely anyone would have

00:05:46.241 --> 00:05:47.241
listened to him.

00:05:47.241 --> 00:05:52.220
Every conspiracy theory origin story needs
at least some shred of credibility from the

00:05:52.220 --> 00:05:55.130
person starting it to get the fire going.

00:05:55.130 --> 00:05:59.530
For Kaysing’s assertions about the moon
landings, this comes in the form of the fact

00:05:59.530 --> 00:06:04.389
that for a brief period he worked for Rocketdyne,
a company that made rockets for the Apollo

00:06:04.389 --> 00:06:05.410
program.

00:06:05.410 --> 00:06:10.780
Not an engineer or having any similar technical
expertise whatsoever, Kaysing's background

00:06:10.780 --> 00:06:15.491
was primarily in writing, earning an English
degree from the University of Redlands, after

00:06:15.491 --> 00:06:18.720
which he naturally got a job making furniture.

00:06:18.720 --> 00:06:22.819
As for the writing gig he landed with Rocketdyne,
his job was initially as a technical writer

00:06:22.819 --> 00:06:28.590
starting in 1956 and he eventually worked
his way up to head of technical publications.

00:06:28.590 --> 00:06:33.569
He finally quit in 1963, deciding he'd had
enough of working for the man.

00:06:33.569 --> 00:06:38.120
After quitting, to quote him, “the rat race”,
in 1963 Kaysing traveled the country in a

00:06:38.120 --> 00:06:42.599
trailer with his family, earning his living
writing books on a variety of topics from

00:06:42.599 --> 00:06:44.449
motorcycles to farming.

00:06:44.449 --> 00:06:48.830
This brings us to 1969 when he, like most
everyone else in the world with access to

00:06:48.830 --> 00:06:50.770
a TV watched the moon landing.

00:06:50.770 --> 00:06:54.810
While watching, Kaysing recalled the supposed
NASA study he’d seen all those years ago,

00:06:54.810 --> 00:06:58.889
as well as that engineers he'd worked with
at the time in the late 1950s claimed that

00:06:58.889 --> 00:07:03.710
while the technology existed to get the astronauts
to the moon, getting them back was not yet

00:07:03.710 --> 00:07:04.710
possible.

00:07:04.710 --> 00:07:08.009
He later stated he further thought,
“As late as 1967 three astronauts died in

00:07:08.009 --> 00:07:09.949
a horrendous fire on the launch pad.

00:07:09.949 --> 00:07:14.389
But as of '69, we could suddenly perform manned
flight upon manned flight?

00:07:14.389 --> 00:07:15.810
With complete success?

00:07:15.810 --> 00:07:18.680
It's just against all statistical odds.”

00:07:18.680 --> 00:07:22.220
Despite often describing himself as “the
fastest pen in the west”, it would take

00:07:22.220 --> 00:07:27.390
Kaysing several years to write the book that
introduced one of the most enduring conspiracy

00:07:27.390 --> 00:07:29.150
theories to the world.

00:07:29.150 --> 00:07:32.979
As for why NASA would bother with the charade,
he claimed NASA worked in tandem with the

00:07:32.979 --> 00:07:38.370
Defence Intelligence Agency to fake the moon
landings to one up those pesky Russians.

00:07:38.370 --> 00:07:42.180
While certainly good for the country if they
could get away with it, the benefit to NASA

00:07:42.180 --> 00:07:44.720
itself was, of course, funding.

00:07:44.720 --> 00:07:49.539
Said Kaysing, "They - both NASA and Rocketdyne
- wanted the money to keep pouring in."

00:07:49.539 --> 00:07:55.090
As to how he knew this, he goes on "I've worked
in aerospace long enough to know that's their

00:07:55.090 --> 00:07:56.090
goal."

00:07:56.090 --> 00:07:57.150
So how did NASA do it?

00:07:57.150 --> 00:08:01.050
He claimed that the footage of the moon landing
was actually filmed on a soundstage.

00:08:01.050 --> 00:08:04.910
When later asked where this soundstage was
located, Kaysing confidently stated that it

00:08:04.910 --> 00:08:06.930
was located in Area 51.

00:08:06.930 --> 00:08:09.590
As he doesn't seem to have ever given clear
evidence as to how he knew this, we can only

00:08:09.590 --> 00:08:16.199
assume because it’s not a proper space related
conspiracy theory if Area 51 isn't mentioned.

00:08:16.199 --> 00:08:21.099
Kaysing also claimed that the F-1 engines
used were too unreliable so NASA instead put

00:08:21.099 --> 00:08:24.319
several B-1 rockets inside each of the F-1
engines.

00:08:24.319 --> 00:08:28.439
Of course, in truth these wouldn't have been
powerful enough to get the Saturn V into orbit

00:08:28.439 --> 00:08:30.320
even if its tanks were mostly empty.

00:08:30.320 --> 00:08:35.320
(And given the frost and ice clearly visible
covering certain relevant parts of the Saturn

00:08:35.320 --> 00:08:39.210
V here, it's apparent the tanks could not
have been mostly empty).

00:08:39.210 --> 00:08:43.600
There's also the little problem that the clusters
of B-1s he described couldn't have fit in

00:08:43.600 --> 00:08:48.300
the F-1 engine bells and you can see footage
of the F-1 engines working as advertised,

00:08:48.300 --> 00:08:51.130
with no clusters of engines anywhere in sight.

00:08:51.130 --> 00:08:54.790
Nevertheless, despite these problems with
his story, he did purport that the Saturn

00:08:54.790 --> 00:08:59.570
V was launched to space as shown (though at
other times has claimed that in fact as soon

00:08:59.570 --> 00:09:03.100
as the rocket was out of sight it was simply
ditched in the ocean and never made it to

00:09:03.100 --> 00:09:04.550
space).

00:09:04.550 --> 00:09:09.130
Stick with us here people, he changed his
story a lot over the years.

00:09:09.130 --> 00:09:14.320
Whatever the case, in all initial cases, he
claims the astronauts were not aboard.

00:09:14.320 --> 00:09:18.500
(And if you're now wondering how the U.S.
fooled the Soviets and other nations tracking

00:09:18.500 --> 00:09:22.380
the rockets during these missions, he claims
a way to fake signals was devised, allowing

00:09:22.380 --> 00:09:27.640
for tracking stations on Earth to think the
craft was headed for the moon and, critically,

00:09:27.640 --> 00:09:31.310
successfully fooling the Soviets who were
indeed closely tracking the missions to the

00:09:31.310 --> 00:09:33.060
moon and back.)

00:09:33.060 --> 00:09:38.680
So what did Neil Armstrong, Buzz Aldrin and
Michael Collins do during the mission if they

00:09:38.680 --> 00:09:41.580
weren’t zipping around in space?

00:09:41.580 --> 00:09:45.040
In the first edition of his book, Kaysing
claims that they flew to Las Vegas where they

00:09:45.040 --> 00:09:50.520
mostly hung out at strip clubs when they weren't
in their rooms on the 24th floor of the Sands

00:09:50.520 --> 00:09:51.520
Hotel.

00:09:51.520 --> 00:09:54.680
We can't make this stuff up, but apparently
Kaysing can.

00:09:54.680 --> 00:09:58.650
Kaysing goes on that at one point one of the
trio got into a fistfight with someone in

00:09:58.650 --> 00:10:01.280
broad daylight over a stripper.

00:10:01.280 --> 00:10:05.070
Sadly Kaysing doesn’t reveal which of the
men did this, nor how he knew about it, so

00:10:05.070 --> 00:10:08.730
we’re forced to assume it was Buzz Aldrin
who is the only member of the three we definitely

00:10:08.730 --> 00:10:11.200
know actually has gotten in a fist fight.

00:10:11.200 --> 00:10:16.760
In this case, in 2002, a 72 year old Buzz
Aldrin punched Bart Sibrel who is a “we

00:10:16.760 --> 00:10:21.120
never landed on the moon” conspiracy theorist,
“documentary” maker, and cab driver.

00:10:21.120 --> 00:10:25.250
Sibrel invited Aldrin to a hotel with Sibrel
telling him he was making a children’s TV

00:10:25.250 --> 00:10:26.250
show on space.

00:10:26.250 --> 00:10:30.269
Once Aldrin arrived at the hotel, Sibrel pulled
out a Bible and tried to get Aldrin to put

00:10:30.269 --> 00:10:33.160
his hand on it and swear that he had walked
on the moon.

00:10:33.160 --> 00:10:35.779
Needless to say, Aldrin was pretty irritated
at this point.

00:10:35.779 --> 00:10:39.470
Things got worse when Sibrel called Aldrin
a “liar” and a “coward”, at which

00:10:39.470 --> 00:10:41.500
point Aldrin punched him.

00:10:41.500 --> 00:10:47.690
As for his defense, Sibrel states, "When someone
has gotten away with a crime, in my opinion,

00:10:47.690 --> 00:10:49.000
they deserve to be ambushed.

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:51.430
I'm a journalist trying to get at the truth."

00:10:51.430 --> 00:10:56.200
Unwilling to sway on what that truth is, however,
Sibrel states, "I do know the moon landings

00:10:56.200 --> 00:10:57.200
were faked.

00:10:57.200 --> 00:10:58.790
I'd bet my life on it."

00:10:58.790 --> 00:11:02.920
Not all is lost, however, because he states,
"I know personally that Trump knows the moon

00:11:02.920 --> 00:11:07.089
landings are fake and he’s biding his time
to reveal it at the end of this term, or at

00:11:07.089 --> 00:11:09.730
the end of his second term if he’s re-elected."

00:11:09.730 --> 00:11:14.190
So, rest easy everyone, the truth will come
out soon enough apparently.

00:11:14.190 --> 00:11:17.760
In any event, going back to Kaysing’s book,
he states that shortly before the astronauts

00:11:17.760 --> 00:11:22.040
were supposed to begin broadcasting from the
moon, all three men arrived on a soundstage

00:11:22.040 --> 00:11:25.970
deep within the confines of Area 51 and ate
cheese sandwiches.

00:11:25.970 --> 00:11:31.490
He also states that along with cheese sandwiches,
NASA provided the men with buxom showgirls

00:11:31.490 --> 00:11:32.760
while at Area 51.

00:11:32.760 --> 00:11:37.310
Presumably this was the only way to pry the
astronauts away from the strip clubs.

00:11:37.310 --> 00:11:42.160
After eating the no doubt delicious sandwiches,
Aldrin and Armstrong put on some space suits

00:11:42.160 --> 00:11:47.450
and pretended to walk across a fake moon set
while reading out some, to quote Kaysing,

00:11:47.450 --> 00:11:52.000
“well-rehearsed lines” in a performance
he called “not great” but “good enough”.

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:56.010
A description we personally feel is a little
unfair considering it has apparently fooled

00:11:56.010 --> 00:12:01.930
seemingly every scientist on Earth then to
now, including ones working for the nation

00:12:01.930 --> 00:12:07.410
directly competing with the US to land on
the moon who would have relished any opportunity

00:12:07.410 --> 00:12:13.089
to even allege the whole thing was faked in
a credible way, let alone prove it and embarrass

00:12:13.089 --> 00:12:15.910
the U.S. utterly in front of the whole world.

00:12:15.910 --> 00:12:19.550
But, unfortunately, as you might imagine,
the Soviets at the time were monitoring the

00:12:19.550 --> 00:12:24.290
whole thing quite closely with their newfangled
technology and so never got the opportunity

00:12:24.290 --> 00:12:26.380
to disprove the landings.

00:12:26.380 --> 00:12:30.430
Amazingly Kaysing also claimed in his book
that the fake moon landing footage was filmed

00:12:30.430 --> 00:12:35.850
live and that there was only “a seven second
delay” between Armstrong and Aldrin’s

00:12:35.850 --> 00:12:38.370
performance and the broadcast the world was
watching.

00:12:38.370 --> 00:12:42.600
Thus, had even a fly buzzed across the set,
NASA would have only seconds to notice and

00:12:42.600 --> 00:12:48.199
cut the feed, lest such a mistake or inconsistency
be noticed in the footage people would be

00:12:48.199 --> 00:12:50.910
watching for the rest of human history.

00:12:50.910 --> 00:12:55.570
As for the splash down and recovery, he claims
the astronauts were eventually put on a military

00:12:55.570 --> 00:13:00.660
cargo plane (a Lockheed C-5 Galaxy) and simply
dropped from it in the capsule.

00:13:00.660 --> 00:13:04.089
As for how he knew this, he did provide a
source for once, claiming that an airline

00:13:04.089 --> 00:13:07.510
pilot he talked to had seen the Apollo 15
module drop from a cargo plane.

00:13:07.510 --> 00:13:11.630
Who this pilot was, what airline he worked
for, if he offered any evidence to support

00:13:11.630 --> 00:13:16.310
his claim, such as a flight log showing him
piloting a plane in the area during the time

00:13:16.310 --> 00:13:21.570
of the splash down of Apollo 15, or even when
he talked to said pilot, however, he fails

00:13:21.570 --> 00:13:22.600
to mention.

00:13:22.600 --> 00:13:26.410
As for the moon rocks brought back, these
were apparently meteorites found in Antarctica

00:13:26.410 --> 00:13:29.760
as well as some that were cleverly made in
a NASA geology lab.

00:13:29.760 --> 00:13:33.560
As to how NASA was able to keep the lid on
things, despite nearly a half a million people

00:13:33.560 --> 00:13:38.320
working on the Apollo Program in some capacity,
not just for NASA but countless independent

00:13:38.320 --> 00:13:43.370
organizations, he claims NASA simply only
let those who needed to know the whole thing

00:13:43.370 --> 00:13:44.390
was a hoax know.

00:13:44.390 --> 00:13:48.639
So following this reasoning that means all
these scientists, engineers, etc. working

00:13:48.639 --> 00:13:53.310
on all the components and various facets of
the mission were genuinely trying to make

00:13:53.310 --> 00:13:57.449
the moon landing happen, including knowing
the requirements to make it happen and testing

00:13:57.449 --> 00:14:00.019
everything they made until it met those requirements...

00:14:00.019 --> 00:14:04.699
Meaning what was built and planned should
have been capable of doing what the mission

00:14:04.699 --> 00:14:05.970
required...

00:14:05.970 --> 00:14:09.899
That said, Kaysing admits a handful of people
here and there would have had to know the

00:14:09.899 --> 00:14:15.740
whole thing was a sham, and thus NASA simply
paid off those who could be paid off, promoted

00:14:15.740 --> 00:14:19.779
those who preferred that reward, threatened
those who still wouldn't go along, and murdered

00:14:19.779 --> 00:14:23.490
those who still resisted, which we'll get
into shortly.

00:14:23.490 --> 00:14:28.680
The ridiculousness of many of these claims
and how easily they crumple under the slightest

00:14:28.680 --> 00:14:34.449
bit of scrutiny is likely why in the 2002
re-release of his book Kaysing changed his

00:14:34.449 --> 00:14:39.170
story in various ways, including claiming
that the engines on the Saturn V actually

00:14:39.170 --> 00:14:44.459
did work and that Collins, Aldrin and Armstrong
did go to space after all, instead of going

00:14:44.459 --> 00:14:46.480
to hang out with strippers in Vegas.

00:14:46.480 --> 00:14:50.480
He then states that all three men orbited
the planet while pre-recorded, not live, footage

00:14:50.480 --> 00:14:52.220
was shown on Earth.

00:14:52.220 --> 00:14:57.160
Despite, to put it mildly, straining credibility
on pretty much everything he said from start

00:14:57.160 --> 00:15:02.070
to finish and him providing absurdly specific
details, generally without bothering to provide

00:15:02.070 --> 00:15:06.660
any evidence whatsoever backing up these claims
and changing those specific details frequently

00:15:06.660 --> 00:15:11.839
over time, Kaysing’s book and subsequent
work nonetheless helped spawn the still thriving

00:15:11.839 --> 00:15:14.899
moon landing hoax conspiracy theory.

00:15:14.899 --> 00:15:16.690
As for Kaysing, he didn't stop there.

00:15:16.690 --> 00:15:20.880
He continued to sporadically come up with
new allegations against NASA, including that

00:15:20.880 --> 00:15:25.399
the agency murdered the astronauts and teacher
aboard the Challenger explosion.

00:15:25.399 --> 00:15:28.540
Why would they do this when the whole Christa
McAuliffe thing was supposed to be a publicity

00:15:28.540 --> 00:15:35.029
stunt to get the public more interested in
space travel, science, and what NASA was doing?

00:15:35.029 --> 00:15:39.279
According to Kaysing, “Christa McAuliffe,
the only civilian and only woman aboard, refused

00:15:39.279 --> 00:15:42.800
to go along with the lie that you couldn't
see stars in space.

00:15:42.800 --> 00:15:47.389
So they blew her up, along with six other
people, to keep that lie under wraps...”

00:15:47.389 --> 00:15:51.389
Speaking of things that Kaysing said that
are ridiculously easy to debunk with even

00:15:51.389 --> 00:15:54.940
a modicum of effort, we feel obligated to
point out that Christa McAuliffe was not the

00:15:54.940 --> 00:15:56.730
only woman on board.

00:15:56.730 --> 00:16:00.930
NASA astronaut Judith Resnik was also killed
in that tragedy.

00:16:00.930 --> 00:16:05.620
Not stopping there, Kaysing also claimed the
deaths of the Apollo 1 astronauts were intentional

00:16:05.620 --> 00:16:09.779
as one or more of the astronauts aboard was
about to blow the whistle on the upcoming

00:16:09.779 --> 00:16:10.779
hoax plan.

00:16:10.779 --> 00:16:14.259
We feel obligated to point out here that,
as previously mentioned, he also used this

00:16:14.259 --> 00:16:18.830
fire as evidence of NASA lacking expertise
to get a man to the moon...

00:16:18.830 --> 00:16:23.019
Meaning according to Kaysing this fire was
somehow both intentional to murder a few astronauts

00:16:23.019 --> 00:16:26.540
and also accidental owing to NASA's incompetence.

00:16:26.540 --> 00:16:31.209
Moving swiftly on, NASA officials also apparently
had others killed, including safety inspector

00:16:31.209 --> 00:16:36.560
at North American Aviation Thomas Baron who
wrote a report on NASA safety protocol violations

00:16:36.560 --> 00:16:38.370
after that tragic Apollo 1 fire.

00:16:38.370 --> 00:16:43.209
It's at this point, we should probably note
that in the 1990s Kaysing decided to sue Jim

00:16:43.209 --> 00:16:44.209
Lovell.

00:16:44.209 --> 00:16:47.450
You see, in 1996 Lovell publicly stated "The
guy is wacky.

00:16:47.450 --> 00:16:49.230
His position makes me feel angry.

00:16:49.230 --> 00:16:52.100
We spent a lot of time getting ready to go
to the moon.

00:16:52.100 --> 00:16:56.579
We spent a lot of money, we took great risks,
and it's something everybody in this country

00:16:56.579 --> 00:16:57.920
should be proud of."

00:16:57.920 --> 00:17:02.160
Lovell also wrote to Kaysing asking him to
"Tear up your manuscript and pursue a project

00:17:02.160 --> 00:17:03.220
that has some meaning.

00:17:03.220 --> 00:17:08.640
Leave a legacy you can be proud of, not some
trash whose readers will doubt your sanity."

00:17:08.640 --> 00:17:12.290
Unwilling to stand for his good name being
publicly besmirched, Kaysing naturally sued

00:17:12.290 --> 00:17:16.020
Lovell for defamation, though the case was
eventually dismissed and nothing ever came

00:17:16.020 --> 00:17:17.209
of it.

00:17:17.209 --> 00:17:20.760
Kaysing continued to assert that the moon
landings were a hoax right up until his death

00:17:20.760 --> 00:17:27.190
in 2005, in between writing books on cookery,
motorcycle safety, farming, taxes, survival,

00:17:27.190 --> 00:17:31.460
how to subsist on very little money, and travel
guides, as well as making occasional appearances

00:17:31.460 --> 00:17:36.150
on such shows as Oprah expounding on his conspiracy
theory work.

00:17:36.150 --> 00:17:40.190
On the side he also promoted micro-housing
as a solution for homeless people and ran

00:17:40.190 --> 00:17:44.540
a cat sanctuary called "FLOCK", standing for
"For the Love of Cats and Kittens".

00:17:44.540 --> 00:17:49.030
So, yes, Kaysing was a man whose passions
included micro housing, cats, survival, travel,

00:17:49.030 --> 00:17:52.820
living off almost nothing, and rapidly coming
up with conspiracy theories.

00:17:52.820 --> 00:17:57.210
If only he'd been born later or the interwebs
invented sooner, this man could have been

00:17:57.210 --> 00:17:58.730
an internet superstar.

00:17:58.730 --> 00:18:02.880
Whatever the case, Kaysing’s death understandably
garnered a mixed reaction from the scientific

00:18:02.880 --> 00:18:07.270
community, with few finding the ability to
muster much sympathy for a man who accused

00:18:07.270 --> 00:18:09.190
NASA of murdering people.

00:18:09.190 --> 00:18:13.880
Gone but not forgotten, Kaysing's ideas have
actually gained in popularity in recent years,

00:18:13.880 --> 00:18:17.890
particularly among younger generations according
to various polls, such as one done by space

00:18:17.890 --> 00:18:25.370
consultant Mary Dittmar in 2005 showing that
25% of people 18-25 doubted man had ever walked

00:18:25.370 --> 00:18:26.370
on the moon.

00:18:26.370 --> 00:18:30.880
This is all despite the fact that it's never
been easier to definitively debunk Kaysing's

00:18:30.880 --> 00:18:31.880
various assertions.

00:18:31.880 --> 00:18:37.140
Not just via reading the countless explanations
by scientists definitively addressing point

00:18:37.140 --> 00:18:43.320
by point every idea ever put forth by moon
landing conspiracy theorists, there's also

00:18:43.320 --> 00:18:47.970
the fact that there are literally pictures
taken in the last decade showing clear evidence

00:18:47.970 --> 00:18:53.090
of some of the equipment sitting on the moon,
including for the Apollo 11, 14, 15, 16, and

00:18:53.090 --> 00:18:55.060
17 landing sites.

00:18:55.060 --> 00:19:00.500
Even in some cases showing the tracks left
by the astronauts and the shadows from the

00:19:00.500 --> 00:19:02.140
flags planted themselves.

00:19:02.140 --> 00:19:07.750
Naturally, moon landing deniers simply claim
these photos too were faked, although why

00:19:07.750 --> 00:19:13.010
China, India, and Japan should cater to NASA
on this one when they independently took pictures

00:19:13.010 --> 00:19:16.610
of their own verifying the moon landings is
anybody's guess.

00:19:16.610 --> 00:19:20.659
We'll have much, much more on all this in
an upcoming article on How Do We Know Man

00:19:20.659 --> 00:19:32.440
Really Walked on

00:19:32.440 --> 00:19:33.720
the Moon?
