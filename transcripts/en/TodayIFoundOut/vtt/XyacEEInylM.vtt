00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:16.170
There are many different species of penguin,
and while our minds might take us to those

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:20.900
living in the Antarctic tundras, freezing
feet isn’t something every penguin has to

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:21.900
contend with.

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:26.460
In fact, there are some species of penguin
living on the equator that need their feet

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:29.710
to be cool to help them battle the heat.

00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:34.750
For the poor penguins who do live in lands
of snow and ice, freezing isn’t usually

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:35.750
an issue.

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:38.780
Most of their body is covered in plumage that
is waterproof, which keeps them warm even

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:40.770
in the chill of an arctic breeze.

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:46.150
Emperor penguins, probably the most recognizable
species, have one of the highest feather densities

00:00:46.150 --> 00:00:50.420
of all birds, with about 100 feathers per
square inch.

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:55.420
Underneath that cozy plumage is a layer of
blubber that acts as an additional blanket.

00:00:55.420 --> 00:00:59.290
With these two layers, penguins typically
can stay toasty warm.

00:00:59.290 --> 00:01:04.460
However, heat does escape from two main areas:
the beak and the feet, but this can actually

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:05.620
be a good thing.

00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:09.970
By having areas that heat can readily escape
from, penguins are able to regulate their

00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:12.920
temperature, keeping them from overheating
at times.

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:16.780
In addition to acting as temperature control,
penguin feet are bare for other reasons as

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:17.780
well.

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:22.030
Penguins need them to grip the ice and help
to steer when they are swimming in icy water.

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:26.850
To answer your question less generically,
penguins have a highly developed circulatory

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:30.880
system that is able to control how warm their
feet actually get.

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:34.160
There are arteries in the penguins’ legs
that are able to adjust blood flow to the

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:35.950
feet based on temperature.

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:39.700
The arteries restrict blood flow when it’s
colder, meaning less blood has to travel through

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:42.440
the cold feet, helping to keep the penguin
warm.

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:45.010
(Humans actually can do this to some extent
as well.)

00:01:45.010 --> 00:01:49.310
When the penguin is too warm, the opposite
happens and the arteries allow more blood

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:51.420
blow to the feet, cooling them off.

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:55.490
Besides this built in mechanism, a more mundane
way the penguin can control their feet’s

00:01:55.490 --> 00:02:00.070
temperature is simply to huddle down around
their feet so that their body is keeping them

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:01.630
more protected and warm.

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:05.780
They also sometimes rock back and sit on their
tails for a while to get their feet off the

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:06.780
ice.

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:10.780
Typically with this heat regulation, the penguins’
feet are kept a few degrees above freezing,

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:15.709
and not usually much warmer than that so that
the penguins don’t expend too much energy

00:02:15.709 --> 00:02:20.090
in heating their feet, unless they are already
too hot, in which case the loss of heat is

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:21.140
a good thing.

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:25.320
Energy is of particular concern to Emperor
penguin dads who incubate their eggs for 64

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:30.560
days away from the coast and don’t eat anything
during this time—so, preserving calories

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:32.349
by not losing much heat is a must!

00:02:32.349 --> 00:02:36.030
The good news is, with their circulatory system,
their feet won’t be turning into ice blocks

00:02:36.030 --> 00:03:09.570
unless their stored food situation 
gets critical.
