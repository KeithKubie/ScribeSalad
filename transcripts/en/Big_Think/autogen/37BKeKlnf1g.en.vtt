are exploring so to me that's really fun
 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:40.010 align:start position:0%
are exploring so to me that's really fun
is<00:00:38.370><c> that</c><00:00:38.460><c> you</c><00:00:38.820><c> know</c><00:00:38.940><c> especially</c><00:00:39.510><c> working</c><00:00:39.840><c> in</c>

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:40.020 align:start position:0%
is that you know especially working in
 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:41.720 align:start position:0%
is that you know especially working in
infectious<00:00:40.500><c> disease</c><00:00:40.829><c> it's</c><00:00:41.010><c> very</c><00:00:41.160><c> interesting</c>

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:41.730 align:start position:0%
infectious disease it's very interesting
 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:45.229 align:start position:0%
infectious disease it's very interesting
because<00:00:42.920><c> these</c><00:00:43.920><c> passes</c><00:00:44.370><c> these</c><00:00:44.460><c> infectious</c>

00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:45.239 align:start position:0%
because these passes these infectious
 

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:47.389 align:start position:0%
because these passes these infectious
diseases<00:00:45.690><c> these</c><00:00:45.960><c> agents</c><00:00:46.500><c> they</c><00:00:46.829><c> evolve</c><00:00:47.160><c> over</c>

00:00:47.389 --> 00:00:47.399 align:start position:0%
diseases these agents they evolve over
 

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:49.910 align:start position:0%
diseases these agents they evolve over
time<00:00:47.550><c> so</c><00:00:48.090><c> it's</c><00:00:48.600><c> you</c><00:00:48.930><c> know</c><00:00:49.050><c> it's</c><00:00:49.079><c> very</c><00:00:49.590><c> much</c><00:00:49.800><c> an</c>

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:49.920 align:start position:0%
time so it's you know it's very much an
 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:52.000 align:start position:0%
time so it's you know it's very much an
arms<00:00:50.129><c> race</c><00:00:50.160><c> and</c><00:00:50.460><c> understanding</c><00:00:51.030><c> how</c><00:00:51.180><c> each</c>

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:52.010 align:start position:0%
arms race and understanding how each
 

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:54.560 align:start position:0%
arms race and understanding how each
changes<00:00:53.010><c> to</c><00:00:53.309><c> protect</c><00:00:53.610><c> itself</c><00:00:53.879><c> and</c><00:00:54.090><c> to</c>

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:54.570 align:start position:0%
changes to protect itself and to
 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:58.279 align:start position:0%
changes to protect itself and to
continue<00:00:55.050><c> and</c><00:00:55.980><c> so</c><00:00:56.309><c> it's</c><00:00:57.090><c> very</c><00:00:57.180><c> much</c><00:00:57.420><c> this</c>

00:00:58.279 --> 00:00:58.289 align:start position:0%
continue and so it's very much this
 

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:00.770 align:start position:0%
continue and so it's very much this
puzzle<00:00:58.829><c> solving</c><00:00:59.190><c> but</c><00:00:59.250><c> with</c><00:00:59.520><c> this</c><00:00:59.670><c> great</c><00:01:00.149><c> you</c>

00:02:06.859 --> 00:02:06.869 align:start position:0%

00:05:50.659 --> 00:05:50.669 align:start position:0%
that was probably like the spark that I
 

00:05:50.669 --> 00:05:52.189 align:start position:0%
that was probably like the spark that I
got<00:05:50.849><c> really</c><00:05:51.060><c> excited</c><00:05:51.539><c> about</c><00:05:51.630><c> that</c><00:05:51.780><c> kind</c><00:05:52.139><c> of</c>

00:05:52.189 --> 00:05:52.199 align:start position:0%

senior year I just really thought I was
 

00:06:15.940 --> 00:06:18.629 align:start position:0%

00:06:20.370 --> 00:06:20.380 align:start position:0%
was really excited about so I think
 

00:06:20.380 --> 00:06:22.680 align:start position:0%
was really excited about so I think
that's<00:06:20.740><c> so</c><00:06:21.160><c> that's</c><00:06:21.340><c> what</c><00:06:21.490><c> I</c><00:06:21.520><c> went</c><00:06:21.729><c> into</c><00:06:21.940><c> I</c><00:06:22.419><c> had</c>

00:06:22.680 --> 00:06:22.690 align:start position:0%
that's so that's what I went into I had
 

00:06:22.690 --> 00:06:24.990 align:start position:0%
that's so that's what I went into I had
to<00:06:23.289><c> do</c><00:06:23.440><c> it</c><00:06:23.530><c> again</c><00:06:23.800><c> I</c><00:06:24.070><c> would</c><00:06:24.580><c> have</c><00:06:24.669><c> been</c><00:06:24.789><c> a</c><00:06:24.820><c> math</c>

00:06:24.990 --> 00:06:25.000 align:start position:0%
to do it again I would have been a math
 

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:27.750 align:start position:0%
to do it again I would have been a math
major<00:06:25.210><c> probably</c><00:06:26.080><c> a</c><00:06:26.110><c> double</c><00:06:26.410><c> major</c><00:06:26.550><c> it</c><00:06:27.550><c> did</c>

00:06:27.750 --> 00:06:27.760 align:start position:0%
major probably a double major it did
 

00:06:27.760 --> 00:06:28.860 align:start position:0%

00:06:28.860 --> 00:06:28.870 align:start position:0%
take a lot of math classes but I would
