00:00:04.460 --> 00:00:07.910
<v 1>joining me today is the host of the relatable podcast,
a speaker,</v>

3
00:00:07.920 --> 00:00:12.080
a commentator at a cat person,
Allie Stuckey.
Welcome to the Rubin report.

4
00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:14.190
Thank you for having me.
All right,
Stuckey.

5
00:00:14.191 --> 00:00:17.420
I have wanted you in the studio for quite some time.
Glad to be here.

6
00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:19.250
It is good to have you here,
but we got,

7
00:00:19.251 --> 00:00:23.900
I got two bones to pick before we do anything to do with cats.
Number one,

8
00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:28.360
you're a cat person.
What's going on?
You just met my dog.
Love about,

9
00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:33.200
she's so sweet.
I love dogs.
I have a dog.
She's a rescue.
I have two cats.

10
00:00:33.201 --> 00:00:35.780
Cats are just,
they're cool and they're easy.

11
00:00:35.781 --> 00:00:38.600
They don't need that much of your time,
that much of your attention.

12
00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:43.190
I travel a lot like you do and so it's nice to just be able to leave the cats,

13
00:00:43.191 --> 00:00:46.550
but you got to put a dog in a Kennel.
You got to pay a bunch of money.

14
00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:48.860
They need your time.
They need your attention.
They need to go outside.

15
00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:52.310
Cats are cool.
They don't really want to hang out with your plotting to kill you.

16
00:00:52.311 --> 00:00:56.120
Most of the Times you're looking at you that they could lunge at you at any

17
00:00:56.121 --> 00:00:59.840
moment.
That's a stereotype that I week expect someone on the left to me,

18
00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:02.150
but that's not true.

19
00:01:02.151 --> 00:01:06.950
You have to take cats by their individual personalities and not categorize them.

20
00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:11.610
Look at how you just used identity politics against me just right.
Right.

21
00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:14.930
It applies to the animal kingdom to,
I just needed you to know.
All right.

22
00:01:14.931 --> 00:01:18.560
That's number one.
Okay.
Just going to have to agree to disagree on cats and dogs.

23
00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:19.641
Number two.

24
00:01:19.641 --> 00:01:23.990
For about two years I had the number one Prager u video.

25
00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:28.070
Oh,
I left the left.
Sorry.
Then you came in there.

26
00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:29.630
You took number one away from me,

27
00:01:29.631 --> 00:01:32.210
but actually I don't know if you know this as of the last,

28
00:01:32.211 --> 00:01:35.170
cause you could see somebody else took number one.
I don't,

29
00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:38.660
I'm not even so we need to get them in here now we have a bone to pick with
them.

30
00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:41.510
Yeah.
I actually can't remember who was,
um,

31
00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:43.640
or what even the topic wasn't sore this morning and I was like,

32
00:01:43.641 --> 00:01:47.600
I don't even want to know.
I don't even want to now.
But you,
uh,
you was,

33
00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:49.850
what was the title of his masculinity?

34
00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:53.540
I think it was like make men masculine naked or something like that.

35
00:01:53.541 --> 00:01:57.680
So I guess that was a hot topic that people really wanted to hear about.
I mean,

36
00:01:57.681 --> 00:02:00.680
it was so fun to make.
Obviously you've made Prager u video too,

37
00:02:00.681 --> 00:02:05.210
but I didn't really anticipate it being one of those viral videos.

38
00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:08.660
I kind of just thought,
okay,
most people in general agree with me,

39
00:02:08.661 --> 00:02:11.490
but the vitriol of course they got you.
You just,

40
00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:16.510
you're continually surprised by some people on the left who are so opposed to

41
00:02:16.791 --> 00:02:19.370
what are very traditional ideas.
So,
yeah.
All right,

42
00:02:19.371 --> 00:02:21.930
well we're going to talk about some of those traditional ideas.
We'll toss,

43
00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:25.490
talk about masculinity and me two and a whole bunch of other stuff called for

44
00:02:25.491 --> 00:02:29.660
people that don't know you.
Yeah.
Where did you come from?
What's going on here?

45
00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:32.750
Yes.
So I started in this whole kind of political,

46
00:02:32.751 --> 00:02:35.030
I won't even say media field,

47
00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:38.480
but kind of about three and a half years ago.

48
00:02:38.481 --> 00:02:41.150
So fall of 2015 I was working in PR,

49
00:02:41.151 --> 00:02:43.940
graduated from college in 2014 PR,

50
00:02:43.941 --> 00:02:47.060
social media just had kind of your normal agency job.

51
00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:51.350
But in fall of 2015 I lived in a college town,
Athens,
Georgia.

52
00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:54.200
And I looked around and the friends that I had,

53
00:02:54.201 --> 00:02:57.620
both in college and out of college had no idea what was going on in the
election.

54
00:02:57.621 --> 00:02:58.580
It was the primaries.

55
00:02:58.581 --> 00:03:03.340
And I thought these are really smart people and a lot of them are conservative

56
00:03:03.341 --> 00:03:07.750
in their values and yet they seem to be touting these progressive use when it

57
00:03:07.751 --> 00:03:10.540
comes to politics and they really have no idea what's going on.

58
00:03:10.541 --> 00:03:12.250
And so I really just kind of had a,

59
00:03:12.251 --> 00:03:16.360
a random idea when I was driving one day called my mom and I said,
you know,

60
00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:19.810
I think I want to tell sorority girls why they should vote in the primaries

61
00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:23.290
because they seem so apathetic.
I feel like I can talk to this crap.

62
00:03:23.291 --> 00:03:27.670
Cause I was a story a girl about a year before that.
And so I created this,

63
00:03:27.671 --> 00:03:32.170
it really was a nonpartisan presentation,
um,
for,

64
00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:34.990
for college students for why they should vote in the primaries.

65
00:03:34.990 --> 00:03:39.600
And I started reaching out to add the sorority presidents and you can find that

66
00:03:39.601 --> 00:03:42.700
information online.
I just said,
can I please come?
I want to speak for free.

67
00:03:42.701 --> 00:03:43.860
It's going to be nonpartisan.

68
00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:47.710
I just want to tell you guys why you should vote in the primaries.
And it worked.

69
00:03:47.711 --> 00:03:47.951
I mean,

70
00:03:47.951 --> 00:03:51.490
I started speaking to some of these groups and then I started getting asked by

71
00:03:51.491 --> 00:03:54.730
other organizations on and off campus,
uh,
to come speak.

72
00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:58.480
And then from that I started a blog and that was called the conservative

73
00:03:58.481 --> 00:04:01.390
millennial,
ditched the nonpartisan thing pretty quickly.

74
00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:04.660
And then after a few months of doing that,

75
00:04:04.661 --> 00:04:06.970
I started making videos and that's kind of what it took off.

76
00:04:06.971 --> 00:04:11.971
So end of 2016 beginning of 2017 is when it probably officially became a career,

77
00:04:13.421 --> 00:04:17.710
started working at the blaze.
And then that changed to,
I moved to CRTV.

78
00:04:17.711 --> 00:04:19.270
That's where I started my podcast.

79
00:04:19.271 --> 00:04:23.410
And that was the beginning of 2018 yes,

80
00:04:23.411 --> 00:04:26.680
I'm getting my years confused.
Beginning of 2018 that I started the podcast,

81
00:04:26.681 --> 00:04:30.700
so still speak,
still commentate.
Um,
I still write.

82
00:04:30.701 --> 00:04:33.400
You still do a lot of the same things I was doing three and a half years ago.

83
00:04:33.401 --> 00:04:35.620
It's just evolved into a full time thing.

84
00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:39.500
<v 2>Yeah,
it's pretty sweet when you start doing something and next thing you know,</v>

85
00:04:39.501 --> 00:04:42.830
it becomes something,
become something.
Right,
right.
Yeah.
Not Bad.

86
00:04:43.390 --> 00:04:45.550
Do you come from a political family or anything?

87
00:04:45.551 --> 00:04:48.550
Did you care about politics before this or was that just your wake up when you

88
00:04:48.551 --> 00:04:51.130
realize nobody knows what they're talking about?
A college?

89
00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:55.320
<v 1>I would say both ant mostly.
Mostly the second one I grew up in,</v>

90
00:04:55.830 --> 00:04:57.600
I wouldn't say it was an a political home.

91
00:04:57.601 --> 00:05:00.950
I knew we were conservatives and I knew we liked the,

92
00:05:00.951 --> 00:05:03.660
the earliest president that I really remember as George W.

93
00:05:03.660 --> 00:05:07.530
Bush and I was really young during nine 11 and I remember the patriotism that my

94
00:05:07.531 --> 00:05:10.230
parents showed and that we were supposed to show.

95
00:05:10.260 --> 00:05:12.330
I knew we were supporting George W.

96
00:05:12.330 --> 00:05:15.150
Bush and we kind of grew up watching Fox News,
but politics,

97
00:05:15.180 --> 00:05:18.840
it wasn't a discussion that we had at the dinner table necessarily.

98
00:05:18.841 --> 00:05:22.620
I just knew the values that we had.
My parents were entrepreneurs.

99
00:05:22.621 --> 00:05:25.110
They came from very poor families in Arkansas.

100
00:05:25.410 --> 00:05:27.030
They had no money when they got married.

101
00:05:27.031 --> 00:05:32.031
They were 19 and 20 and they really went from nothing and then built a business

102
00:05:32.521 --> 00:05:34.380
and built a life for my brothers.

103
00:05:34.381 --> 00:05:36.720
And for me that was so much better than the ones that they had.

104
00:05:37.050 --> 00:05:41.850
And so the idea of freedom of entrepreneurship,

105
00:05:41.851 --> 00:05:46.020
of not having a cap on your potential was just always really attractive to me.

106
00:05:46.021 --> 00:05:49.440
So there was never a time in college,
high school,

107
00:05:49.470 --> 00:05:51.990
even as a rebellious teenager that I was like,
you know,

108
00:05:52.320 --> 00:05:55.690
more government control actually sounds really good.
It just,
it just never,

109
00:05:55.890 --> 00:05:58.400
never occurred to me that that lead to a better life.

110
00:05:58.401 --> 00:06:01.400
I just always loved the entrepreneurial spirit and the idea of the American

111
00:06:01.401 --> 00:06:04.610
dream that my parents embodied.
So it was more of those values.

112
00:06:04.611 --> 00:06:09.290
Rather than talking about politics,
my dad did become a state representative,
um,

113
00:06:09.350 --> 00:06:13.910
when I was in college,
I think it was 2012 and so yeah,

114
00:06:13.911 --> 00:06:16.040
that probably spurred some interest.

115
00:06:16.041 --> 00:06:20.420
I started probably getting a more knowledgeable and more informed about actually

116
00:06:20.421 --> 00:06:22.760
what was going on.
But yeah,

117
00:06:22.761 --> 00:06:26.300
I would say it's more a lifelong value building thing.

118
00:06:26.300 --> 00:06:29.450
And then by the time I graduated college I was like,
oh my gosh,

119
00:06:29.451 --> 00:06:31.490
I feel like our nation is kind of at a crisis.

120
00:06:31.730 --> 00:06:35.240
How does religion play a role in that?
It plays a huge,
it plays a huge role.

121
00:06:35.241 --> 00:06:39.440
You know,
we hear a lot,
especially from people in the lot,
uh,

122
00:06:39.441 --> 00:06:41.300
that your religious views should have,

123
00:06:41.340 --> 00:06:44.810
have no impact on what you believe politically.
Well,

124
00:06:44.811 --> 00:06:47.780
that's just a false idea of,

125
00:06:47.990 --> 00:06:50.260
of religion and a false idea of your faith.
If the,

126
00:06:50.420 --> 00:06:52.160
if your faith is the center of your life,

127
00:06:52.161 --> 00:06:55.340
which religious people believe that it should be and it's going to affect

128
00:06:55.341 --> 00:06:58.040
everything,
it's going to affect all of your values.

129
00:06:58.041 --> 00:07:01.170
It's going to affect probably how you vote.
Um,

130
00:07:01.250 --> 00:07:04.880
and it's going to affect that the things that you believe in politically and the

131
00:07:04.881 --> 00:07:06.770
way that you think that the country should go.

132
00:07:07.100 --> 00:07:11.840
And so be not only a born again Christian,
but also a Protestant Christian.

133
00:07:12.170 --> 00:07:16.910
Um,
having roots in even the Protestant reformation and how that kind of affected

134
00:07:16.911 --> 00:07:17.151
the,

135
00:07:17.151 --> 00:07:20.900
the movement of the West towards freedom and towards the individual liberty I

136
00:07:20.901 --> 00:07:25.100
think has certainly been a legacy that was passed down to me.
And it all just,

137
00:07:25.130 --> 00:07:27.410
it all has always made sense.

138
00:07:27.411 --> 00:07:32.000
I wish I had like a better journey story of changing my mind,

139
00:07:32.030 --> 00:07:36.440
but the idea of individual liberty and human dignity and all of the rights that

140
00:07:36.441 --> 00:07:39.230
come with that,
it just,
it just always made sense.

141
00:07:39.340 --> 00:07:43.000
<v 2>The stories that come from a little more of an evolution that they are no more</v>

142
00:07:43.001 --> 00:07:47.290
violence and pain and anger,
but there's Tracy they make for a good story.
Yeah.

143
00:07:47.291 --> 00:07:51.480
They look for a good book.
Yeah.
Perhaps.
Perhaps.
Maybe.
I don't know.
Um,

144
00:07:51.490 --> 00:07:54.670
so when you got into the online world and started posting videos,

145
00:07:54.880 --> 00:07:56.830
podcasting and all that,
um,

146
00:07:56.920 --> 00:08:01.000
were you shocked that sort of the tenor and the way people talk about these

147
00:08:01.001 --> 00:08:02.680
things and all that?
Well,

148
00:08:02.790 --> 00:08:04.740
<v 1>ah,
you know,
when I first started,</v>

149
00:08:04.741 --> 00:08:08.430
when I first started the blog and then I started doing videos,
I mean,
one,

150
00:08:08.431 --> 00:08:11.880
I had no money,
no backers,

151
00:08:11.881 --> 00:08:14.430
no idea what I was doing.
And the,
I mean,

152
00:08:14.431 --> 00:08:18.210
the first videos that I did or in my living room,
I have no makeup on,

153
00:08:18.270 --> 00:08:22.650
no light and using my phone look ridiculous.
Got No views whatsoever.

154
00:08:22.651 --> 00:08:26.580
And so it was after I persisted for a little bit,

155
00:08:26.581 --> 00:08:29.040
sometimes I look back and I'm like,
why did you even persists?

156
00:08:29.060 --> 00:08:31.380
No one was telling you to,
but you did.

157
00:08:31.381 --> 00:08:35.190
And then it's really the first time that you get any kind of attention or

158
00:08:35.191 --> 00:08:38.790
affirmation that you also see the other side of it,
uh,

159
00:08:38.791 --> 00:08:41.670
that you also see the negativity when you're just doing it kind of for yourself.

160
00:08:41.671 --> 00:08:44.430
And for the few people that follow you,
you're like,
this is great.

161
00:08:44.490 --> 00:08:46.590
Everyone loves me.
The three people that follow me,

162
00:08:46.740 --> 00:08:49.740
all of me and my parents and my husband love what I do.
This is great.

163
00:08:50.010 --> 00:08:53.490
But then as soon as something kind of blows up,
yeah,
as they say,

164
00:08:53.491 --> 00:08:55.770
you see the negative side of it and you okay.

165
00:08:55.771 --> 00:08:57.630
People don't just disagree with you,

166
00:08:57.930 --> 00:09:01.050
they really hate you and they really think that you're a bad person.

167
00:09:01.051 --> 00:09:05.400
Especially if you espouse any kind of faith that immediately comes into question

168
00:09:05.401 --> 00:09:07.830
if you disagree with them.
And that was hard.
I mean,

169
00:09:07.831 --> 00:09:11.160
I used to focus on the comments a lot.
You have to stop doing that though.

170
00:09:11.161 --> 00:09:15.630
It's so unhealthy.
So that's kind of a,
that's changed over the past few years.

171
00:09:15.631 --> 00:09:20.160
Definitely.
But uh,
yeah,
I think the hatred threw me for a loop at first.

172
00:09:20.360 --> 00:09:23.150
<v 2>Yeah.
Well it just sort of comes and you don't really know what to do.</v>

173
00:09:23.151 --> 00:09:24.110
And then at some point,

174
00:09:24.111 --> 00:09:26.660
I think I've come around to the place where it's like the more I get,
I'm like,

175
00:09:26.690 --> 00:09:28.430
oh,
I must be doing something right.
Yeah.

176
00:09:29.090 --> 00:09:31.550
People used to lie about what I was saying and I didn't like that.

177
00:09:31.700 --> 00:09:34.820
Now they actually quote me and I'm like,
Oh,
this is actually,

178
00:09:35.340 --> 00:09:37.430
this is what must be feel like when you made it.

179
00:09:37.590 --> 00:09:39.800
I think it was actually you that tweeted the other day,

180
00:09:39.801 --> 00:09:43.660
some article by right wing watch.
It was I you,
yes,

181
00:09:44.440 --> 00:09:45.130
they did

182
00:09:45.130 --> 00:09:46.610
<v 1>call on me not that long ago too.</v>

183
00:09:46.611 --> 00:09:51.260
They quoted something that I said at CRTV and of course everything looks like

184
00:09:51.290 --> 00:09:53.270
it's some hit piece,
but then I read it and I'm like,

185
00:09:53.750 --> 00:09:57.280
<v 2>that's what I,
that's what I said.
I was like,</v>

186
00:09:57.320 --> 00:10:01.090
this is an actual basically an honest piece.
Right.

187
00:10:01.100 --> 00:10:03.620
They were really close as quoted show.
Exactly.
And I'm like,

188
00:10:03.621 --> 00:10:06.800
if people think that's crazy,
I'm totally fine with that.
But like you said,

189
00:10:06.801 --> 00:10:09.750
don't lie about the lie about what I'm saying.
Right?
Yeah.
Yeah.

190
00:10:10.100 --> 00:10:14.240
Is it unique to be a woman in this space?
Use the little identity politics here.

191
00:10:14.241 --> 00:10:16.640
I thought Republicans and the right,
I thought they hate women.

192
00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:19.070
You don't listen to women,
don't they subjugate women

193
00:10:22.480 --> 00:10:23.890
who are pregnant,
but you know,
but

194
00:10:24.500 --> 00:10:28.920
<v 1>she goes and so I am.
I've against that part of that.
No,
I,
I've never,</v>

195
00:10:28.921 --> 00:10:30.990
I've never really understood that argument.

196
00:10:30.991 --> 00:10:35.991
I guess if you equate women's rights to abortion and to this mythical gender

197
00:10:36.001 --> 00:10:39.270
wage gap that needs to somehow be filled by the government,

198
00:10:39.480 --> 00:10:43.110
if you equate women's rights to that and women's empowerment did that then sure.

199
00:10:43.410 --> 00:10:46.560
Um,
I guess the left is the only place for women.

200
00:10:46.561 --> 00:10:51.360
But if you believe in entrepreneurship,
if you believe in the marketplace,

201
00:10:51.450 --> 00:10:54.870
if you believe that women have the potential and the dignity that a man has and

202
00:10:54.871 --> 00:10:58.410
the potential to do everything that a man does in a way,

203
00:10:58.411 --> 00:11:01.050
at least as far as her career goes and leadership goes,

204
00:11:01.350 --> 00:11:04.350
then I don't see why you wouldn't be a conservative.
Unfortunately,

205
00:11:04.351 --> 00:11:08.790
we do have a PR problem,
uh,
on the right,
and I voted for president Trump,

206
00:11:08.791 --> 00:11:13.050
but president Trump doesn't really help the rights case when it comes to women,

207
00:11:13.620 --> 00:11:16.230
not just because of things he said and done with women.

208
00:11:16.231 --> 00:11:20.130
But also I think a lot of moms especially hear him talk,

209
00:11:20.131 --> 00:11:23.820
hear him at his rallies,
he's got a little bit of a of a mouth and they're like,

210
00:11:24.390 --> 00:11:26.820
I don't,
you know,
I don't really want my kids listening to that.

211
00:11:26.821 --> 00:11:29.460
That's not who I want my kids to be.
I wouldn't marry someone like that.

212
00:11:29.461 --> 00:11:33.000
And so I do think that he makes it a little bit difficult sometimes to make the

213
00:11:33.001 --> 00:11:33.834
case.

214
00:11:34.300 --> 00:11:37.060
<v 2>Is that the odd catch 22 of almost everything Trump does?</v>

215
00:11:37.061 --> 00:11:39.190
Cause we talked about this briefly right before we started where it's like the

216
00:11:39.191 --> 00:11:41.320
policies pretty much make sense.

217
00:11:41.321 --> 00:11:44.230
And if you can remove that from the tweets or the person,

218
00:11:44.231 --> 00:11:48.190
it's like he's actually at a ton of high level women in the administration.

219
00:11:48.191 --> 00:11:52.180
If you care,
if that's what you're looking at,
it just makes it more difficult,

220
00:11:52.181 --> 00:11:54.070
I think that you're able to

221
00:11:54.070 --> 00:11:54.610
<v 1>do it.</v>

222
00:11:54.610 --> 00:11:59.110
But when the left has such a monopoly on media megaphones,

223
00:11:59.320 --> 00:12:02.860
when they have a monopoly on Hollywood,
they have a monopoly on academia.

224
00:12:02.861 --> 00:12:03.760
I won't say monopoly,

225
00:12:03.761 --> 00:12:06.610
but they're controlling a lot of the messaging that comes out and they're,

226
00:12:06.820 --> 00:12:10.510
they're good at PR,
they're good at the emotionalism that,
not to be sexist,

227
00:12:10.511 --> 00:12:12.400
but appeals to a lot of women.

228
00:12:12.610 --> 00:12:16.480
And so you hear the rhetoric of Trump is putting kids in cages and he grabs

229
00:12:16.481 --> 00:12:19.900
women by the genitals and you're a woman.
You're like,
I can't vote for that.

230
00:12:19.930 --> 00:12:20.681
I can't do that.

231
00:12:20.681 --> 00:12:25.180
And so in order to separate some of the lies from the truth and separate the

232
00:12:25.181 --> 00:12:28.870
things that Trump has said from the good things that he's done for men and
women,

233
00:12:29.050 --> 00:12:31.540
you have to think,
and you have to go a step further.

234
00:12:31.541 --> 00:12:35.410
You have to do your own research.
And a lot of people,
male or female,

235
00:12:35.710 --> 00:12:37.510
just don't want to do that.

236
00:12:37.511 --> 00:12:40.390
When you can read headlines by just swiping your thumb,

237
00:12:40.630 --> 00:12:44.650
why are you going to take the time to actually click on an article and then

238
00:12:44.710 --> 00:12:46.780
double check it and make sure that it's right?

239
00:12:46.810 --> 00:12:50.170
It's just harder to be a conservative for that very reason.
It takes more effort.

240
00:12:50.310 --> 00:12:52.680
<v 2>How do you cut through the clutter?
I mean,
that's one of the things that,</v>

241
00:12:52.681 --> 00:12:55.380
especially when I go to colleges,
that kids ask me all the time like,

242
00:12:55.381 --> 00:12:58.140
how do you actually figure out what's true?

243
00:12:58.510 --> 00:13:01.890
Because reading all of these articles,
it's like,
I mean,

244
00:13:01.891 --> 00:13:04.410
we know because they write them about us and then it's like,
well,

245
00:13:04.411 --> 00:13:07.260
I know what lies that were in there.
So what else?

246
00:13:07.470 --> 00:13:08.610
What else are they lying to us about?

247
00:13:08.640 --> 00:13:11.220
<v 1>I mean,
you really have to try and go to the source if you can.</v>

248
00:13:11.221 --> 00:13:13.020
If they said that someone says something,

249
00:13:13.170 --> 00:13:17.580
you have to actually go to the actual quote or the actual video.
I mean,

250
00:13:17.730 --> 00:13:22.170
a perfect example of this is when president Trump,
uh,
just the other day,

251
00:13:22.290 --> 00:13:27.240
the clip of him saying or allegedly saying that asylum seekers we're animals

252
00:13:27.241 --> 00:13:31.830
with circulating.
Great.
Yeah.
It was deceptively edited.
And so in order for you,

253
00:13:31.860 --> 00:13:34.500
someone like Chrissy Tiegen who tweeted about it and said that,
you know,

254
00:13:34.501 --> 00:13:35.850
he's awful.
Okay.

255
00:13:35.851 --> 00:13:38.790
In order for you not to believe Chrissy Tiegen for in order for you to not

256
00:13:38.791 --> 00:13:40.330
believe the tweets that she quote tweeted,

257
00:13:40.620 --> 00:13:43.570
<v 2>you're several Democratic candidates by the way.
Yes,
yes.
Also,</v>

258
00:13:43.571 --> 00:13:46.360
so it's not just Hollywood celebrities,
even though they knew he wasn't,

259
00:13:46.540 --> 00:13:50.140
just to be very clear here,
he was not saying that asylum seeker,

260
00:13:50.330 --> 00:13:53.560
Mcgregor animals,
he was specifically talking about Ms.

261
00:13:54.120 --> 00:13:58.800
<v 1>Yeah.
Which is a totally appropriate description of them.
Um,</v>

262
00:13:58.860 --> 00:14:00.960
but in order to realize that that's a lie,

263
00:14:01.110 --> 00:14:03.870
you have to jump through a lot of hoops.
I mean,

264
00:14:03.871 --> 00:14:05.550
because say I'm someone on the laughter Sam,

265
00:14:05.560 --> 00:14:08.340
someone in the middle and I see Dave Rubin or Ben Shapiro say,

266
00:14:08.490 --> 00:14:11.340
that's not really what he said.
Well,
why should I believe you anymore?

267
00:14:11.341 --> 00:14:15.000
So you have to go to the actual source.
You have to go to actual reporting.

268
00:14:15.120 --> 00:14:15.931
It's more effort.

269
00:14:15.931 --> 00:14:19.080
That's something that you and I are probably willing to do because we know the

270
00:14:19.081 --> 00:14:22.080
game that they're playing.
But a lot of people just don't know.

271
00:14:22.200 --> 00:14:25.880
But I also think that's why people are turning away.
Um,

272
00:14:26.310 --> 00:14:30.030
especially young people from mainstream media and from talking had to listening

273
00:14:30.031 --> 00:14:33.690
to podcasts where there's conversations and when there's dialogue where there's

274
00:14:33.691 --> 00:14:36.270
nuance and where people are willing to say,
you know,

275
00:14:36.271 --> 00:14:39.060
I don't know that much about this.
Here's what both sides are saying.

276
00:14:39.240 --> 00:14:42.810
You hardly ever see that on the news.
So I think,
I think that's part of it.

277
00:14:42.811 --> 00:14:44.460
It's a change in the media landscape.

278
00:14:44.650 --> 00:14:46.840
<v 2>Yeah.
Where do you think Trump fits in?</v>

279
00:14:46.841 --> 00:14:49.780
I try not to do that much about Trump in general,
but since you brought him up.

280
00:14:49.810 --> 00:14:50.643
Yeah.
Um,

281
00:14:50.680 --> 00:14:54.800
where do think he fits in with sort of the future of conservatism then is I can

282
00:14:54.801 --> 00:14:56.720
sense a little push and pull with you on him.

283
00:14:56.800 --> 00:14:59.830
<v 1>Yeah.
I mean I voted for him and I think I'll vote for him again.</v>

284
00:14:59.831 --> 00:15:04.540
It's mostly because I voted for him in 2016 mostly because lesser of two evils

285
00:15:04.541 --> 00:15:09.460
then I didn't think that he was going to lead very conservatively.
I mean,

286
00:15:09.461 --> 00:15:13.510
especially prolife,
it's a huge issue for me at,
he had just a few years earlier,

287
00:15:13.511 --> 00:15:14.740
said he was pro choice.

288
00:15:14.770 --> 00:15:18.790
He didn't seem to emulate any of the conservative or Christian value is that I

289
00:15:18.791 --> 00:15:19.720
hold in my life.

290
00:15:19.990 --> 00:15:23.260
But then I looked at Hillary Clinton and I looked at how I felt like the country

291
00:15:23.261 --> 00:15:26.950
was torn apart by Barack Obama over the past eight years.
And I was like,
okay,

292
00:15:27.250 --> 00:15:32.250
someone who is going to probably advocate for legislation and surround himself

293
00:15:32.531 --> 00:15:35.710
with people that aligns more with my values or someone who I think is

294
00:15:35.711 --> 00:15:39.010
diametrically opposed policywise to everything I believe.

295
00:15:39.220 --> 00:15:42.520
So I chose him and I think I would choose him again because again,
I,

296
00:15:42.760 --> 00:15:45.430
not that I would ever vote Democrat and I've never been on the left.

297
00:15:45.700 --> 00:15:47.830
But if I were,
say I were a centrist,

298
00:15:47.831 --> 00:15:50.740
I would be looking over to the left and saying,
okay,

299
00:15:50.741 --> 00:15:53.530
this guy don't like what he says,
don't like his personality.

300
00:15:53.531 --> 00:15:56.230
I think he's too brash and sometimes he doesn't make any sense.

301
00:15:56.231 --> 00:16:00.040
He calls Tim Cook Tim Apple.
Okay.
Yeah.
Like he's a little embarrassing.

302
00:16:00.041 --> 00:16:02.890
But then I will get people who are advocating for late term abortion,

303
00:16:02.891 --> 00:16:05.120
open borders and socialism.
And I'm like,
oh,

304
00:16:05.130 --> 00:16:08.170
like my babies and my private property,
I think I'm gonna stick with Trump.

305
00:16:08.620 --> 00:16:10.690
And so yeah,

306
00:16:10.691 --> 00:16:14.170
I'm even more so in that camp because I am a conservative and I do care about

307
00:16:14.171 --> 00:16:16.480
the future of the country and I hate socialism.

308
00:16:16.780 --> 00:16:18.550
So of course I'm going to vote for him again.

309
00:16:18.551 --> 00:16:22.040
And I think that's how a lot of people feel sometimes a hard case to make.

310
00:16:22.120 --> 00:16:24.250
<v 2>Yeah,
that's how I see it.
I mean,</v>

311
00:16:24.251 --> 00:16:27.070
it's like if you guys could just not be that bananas,

312
00:16:27.220 --> 00:16:30.130
they can then the refugees who wouldn't do it leaving you,

313
00:16:30.310 --> 00:16:33.010
but you just can't not be completely insane.

314
00:16:33.070 --> 00:16:36.430
<v 1>No,
they give us something here.
Well sometimes I wonder if it's a strategy.</v>

315
00:16:36.431 --> 00:16:40.210
Are they taking us to the nth degree?
Are they taking us to the,

316
00:16:40.270 --> 00:16:44.290
the most crazy Marxism that they can actually take us?
Are they taking us to,

317
00:16:44.291 --> 00:16:48.340
for example,
medicare for all,
just so we'll get on board with healthcare for all.

318
00:16:48.550 --> 00:16:52.300
Are they taking us to open borders just so we'll be okay with abolishing ice?

319
00:16:52.460 --> 00:16:54.190
Are they taking us to,
you know,

320
00:16:54.191 --> 00:16:56.440
killing babies outside of the womb to where we can say,
okay,

321
00:16:56.441 --> 00:16:59.620
as long as limited the second trimester.
Because I,
I mean,

322
00:16:59.621 --> 00:17:01.720
I don't think that's going to work,
but I do wonder,

323
00:17:01.721 --> 00:17:03.220
are you guys pushing us to the limits?

324
00:17:03.250 --> 00:17:06.670
So we'll settle for something a little bit less,
but that's still liberal.

325
00:17:06.671 --> 00:17:08.160
I don't know.
Yeah,
I mean not,

326
00:17:08.770 --> 00:17:12.910
<v 2>I suppose that could,
well,
you know,
I don't know what the answer is,</v>

327
00:17:12.911 --> 00:17:16.150
but I suppose they could be doing,
I mean,
Trump does a little of that,
right?
Yes.

328
00:17:16.160 --> 00:17:18.550
Take out something really far and then you come in.
I mean,

329
00:17:18.551 --> 00:17:20.770
that's what negotiations,
you're right.
Yeah.
I don't know.

330
00:17:20.771 --> 00:17:24.370
But watching these guys go off the deep end has been quite something.

331
00:17:24.371 --> 00:17:27.460
And so I mentioned to you a couple of days ago on,
uh,
on Twitter.

332
00:17:27.461 --> 00:17:32.410
So you've been hitting the AOC pretty hard.
And I think your arguments,

333
00:17:32.411 --> 00:17:36.650
you never attack or personally you always go for policy or for the,

334
00:17:36.651 --> 00:17:40.540
the context of what she's talking about.
Yeah.
Um,

335
00:17:40.690 --> 00:17:43.870
tell me a little bit about why you're not thrilled with AOC.

336
00:17:44.330 --> 00:17:47.900
<v 1>Well,
we hear a lot of people in the last sane,
oh,
AOC gets tea.
All,</v>

337
00:17:47.901 --> 00:17:51.420
she's really getting into y'all,
she really bothers you.
And I'm like,
yes,

338
00:17:51.421 --> 00:17:54.120
she really does.
I'm not even going to pretend like she does it,

339
00:17:54.210 --> 00:17:55.290
especially bothering me.

340
00:17:55.470 --> 00:18:00.470
She specially bothers me because she is representative of millennials,

341
00:18:01.351 --> 00:18:02.580
which she isn't really,

342
00:18:02.581 --> 00:18:07.320
but she's representative of the stereotypes of millennials and she's a woman and

343
00:18:07.321 --> 00:18:12.321
so she is claiming to represent all millennials and all women and she is

344
00:18:13.350 --> 00:18:16.800
espousing and saying everything that is so diametrically opposed,

345
00:18:16.801 --> 00:18:18.090
not only to what I believe in,

346
00:18:18.091 --> 00:18:22.830
but what is good for America and also like she just says dumb things.

347
00:18:22.950 --> 00:18:27.180
Just dumb.
It's not that okay.
She's crazy.
Like I think Bernie Sanders is crazy,

348
00:18:27.330 --> 00:18:30.210
but I think he's probably smart.
Like he can make a pretty good argument.

349
00:18:30.510 --> 00:18:32.310
She just isn't good.

350
00:18:32.311 --> 00:18:36.090
She's not even good at fulfilling her own arguments and I think it's her.

351
00:18:36.690 --> 00:18:41.490
It's the hypocrisy to of same.
Well,
no one has any legitimate concerns with me.

352
00:18:41.640 --> 00:18:43.950
No one has any legitimate criticism.

353
00:18:44.370 --> 00:18:49.020
I'm going to pull this random tweet from this person with 10 followers and say,

354
00:18:49.140 --> 00:18:53.040
well,
this is all of the right,
making fun of my shoes.
This is all they've got.

355
00:18:53.400 --> 00:18:53.770
We'll know.

356
00:18:53.770 --> 00:18:57.870
There's been a lot of people asking you for dialogue and debate and to discuss

357
00:18:57.871 --> 00:19:01.140
ideas and policies and you refuse to,
that's what bothers me.

358
00:19:01.420 --> 00:19:05.680
<v 2>Yeah.
So what do we do about that?
Because the energy of the media,
the focus,</v>

359
00:19:05.681 --> 00:19:08.740
so much of it is on her.
I agree.
I don't think she's particularly bright.

360
00:19:08.741 --> 00:19:12.500
I think she has handlers that at times are writing her.

361
00:19:12.640 --> 00:19:15.580
She's not writing most of these tweets.
Yes,
maybe she types them out,

362
00:19:15.970 --> 00:19:19.570
but it's very clear if you listen to her speak the way she speaks and her

363
00:19:19.870 --> 00:19:23.350
understanding of information is very loose.

364
00:19:23.380 --> 00:19:25.000
And then in Twitter form,

365
00:19:25.090 --> 00:19:28.690
she knows all these things about history and policy and all of these things and

366
00:19:28.691 --> 00:19:31.120
the idea that she wrote the green deal or any of that stuff.

367
00:19:31.570 --> 00:19:32.530
It's just all nonsense.

368
00:19:32.531 --> 00:19:36.700
But what do you do if so much of the energy is focused there?
Um,
which I,

369
00:19:36.701 --> 00:19:38.410
you know,
I think we're in agreement.
It's dangerous.

370
00:19:38.680 --> 00:19:40.720
How do you move that if she won't debate?

371
00:19:40.880 --> 00:19:41.450
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

372
00:19:41.450 --> 00:19:44.990
I think that all you can do is advocate for your own policies and ideas the best

373
00:19:44.991 --> 00:19:47.870
way that you can.
And yes,
of course,
to call out her lies and say,

374
00:19:48.080 --> 00:19:51.020
this is why it's a lie.
I mean,
you might not convince everyone,

375
00:19:51.140 --> 00:19:54.230
but maybe there is one person who thought that her tweet was awesome and looked

376
00:19:54.231 --> 00:19:55.760
at what you said and said,
okay,

377
00:19:55.761 --> 00:19:59.150
well maybe now I am starting to see a pattern of not just her,

378
00:19:59.151 --> 00:20:01.980
but people like her that use identity politics and use,
uh,

379
00:20:02.120 --> 00:20:05.390
this victimhood narrative.
Someone like Ilhan Omar as well to say,
Oh,

380
00:20:05.391 --> 00:20:07.940
you can't criticize me.
I'm seeing that a lot.

381
00:20:07.941 --> 00:20:11.180
Maybe her credibility comes into question.
So I do think that's important.

382
00:20:11.420 --> 00:20:14.120
I think it's important to keep it above board as much as we can with the

383
00:20:14.121 --> 00:20:18.290
criticisms.
Now I'm not necessarily good at that.
Like sometimes I just want to,

384
00:20:19.090 --> 00:20:21.260
yeah.
And I don't,
I don't want to call it,
I mean,

385
00:20:21.320 --> 00:20:24.740
I don't think I ever go for anything super personal or ad Hominine,

386
00:20:24.741 --> 00:20:27.650
but there are times where I just want to be like,
this girl's an idiot.

387
00:20:27.651 --> 00:20:31.040
She's an idiot.
And I don't think that that's probably just to call myself out.

388
00:20:31.041 --> 00:20:32.840
I don't think that's the most productive thing to do.

389
00:20:32.841 --> 00:20:35.390
We should probably say why she's wrong.
Um,

390
00:20:35.391 --> 00:20:40.010
but someone who I think is actually trying to play her same game,
um,

391
00:20:40.040 --> 00:20:42.530
it's a little bit different cause he's older and he's a man.

392
00:20:42.531 --> 00:20:47.531
But Dan Crinshaw is using social media to his benefit to actually talk about

393
00:20:48.251 --> 00:20:49.780
what's going on in Congress.
Say,

394
00:20:49.781 --> 00:20:52.690
here's the legislation I'm trying to get past here for the Democrats are doing,

395
00:20:52.870 --> 00:20:54.040
here's the back and forth fight.

396
00:20:54.220 --> 00:20:57.340
We have hardly any transparency in Congress from the right.

397
00:20:57.520 --> 00:20:59.590
We don't have a young representative that saying,
okay,

398
00:20:59.830 --> 00:21:02.260
this is what you're hearing.
Here's what's actually happening.

399
00:21:02.440 --> 00:21:04.090
AOC is trying to do that.

400
00:21:04.210 --> 00:21:07.120
But you do have someone like Dan Crenshaw who trying to do it on our side.

401
00:21:07.121 --> 00:21:08.050
And I think that's important.

402
00:21:08.190 --> 00:21:12.690
<v 2>What do you think is the goal of this new crop of Democrats?
Like do you like,</v>

403
00:21:12.691 --> 00:21:13.171
to me,

404
00:21:13.171 --> 00:21:18.171
they genuinely want to change every fundamental law and every fundamental

405
00:21:21.570 --> 00:21:25.800
philosophy that is underpinned this country for over 200 years.
I mean,

406
00:21:25.900 --> 00:21:28.710
really it sounds alarmist.
It sounds conspiratorial,

407
00:21:28.711 --> 00:21:32.120
but I think they're deeply on proud of what America is.
Yeah.
Um,

408
00:21:32.310 --> 00:21:34.910
and it's very sad for me as we talked about right before we started,

409
00:21:34.920 --> 00:21:37.110
it's like this ain't the party at JFK anymore.

410
00:21:37.190 --> 00:21:40.040
<v 1>Right?
It was one thing when we just disagreed on policy.</v>

411
00:21:40.041 --> 00:21:42.320
It's another thing when we disagree on patriotism,

412
00:21:42.321 --> 00:21:47.090
it's when we disagree that fundamentally America was founded on good ideas.

413
00:21:47.091 --> 00:21:49.010
Maybe you don't like the founder founding fathers,

414
00:21:49.011 --> 00:21:50.870
maybe you don't even like that they owned slaves.

415
00:21:51.170 --> 00:21:54.530
Maybe you think that America has a bad history.
We can probably agree on that.

416
00:21:54.531 --> 00:21:58.220
That America doesn't have a perfect history but us not agreeing on basic

417
00:21:58.221 --> 00:22:00.620
constitutional values of individual liberty,

418
00:22:00.621 --> 00:22:03.680
of the rates that are endowed to us by our creator.

419
00:22:03.681 --> 00:22:06.080
That creates a whole other host of problems.

420
00:22:06.081 --> 00:22:10.070
We have not more complicated disagreements between this new crop,

421
00:22:10.220 --> 00:22:12.620
but a more fundamental disagreements,

422
00:22:12.621 --> 00:22:15.140
more simple disagreements than we've ever had before.

423
00:22:15.410 --> 00:22:18.800
That's what makes them so frustrated.
And,
and people like me,

424
00:22:18.801 --> 00:22:23.030
like us who care about American values and are down with the constitution,

425
00:22:23.360 --> 00:22:24.980
it's really kind of mind boggling.

426
00:22:24.980 --> 00:22:27.740
Like we don't even know where to take their arguments sometimes.

427
00:22:27.980 --> 00:22:29.990
But when you look at what's coming out of academia,

428
00:22:29.991 --> 00:22:33.680
I mean all this postmodern garbage,
it kind of makes sense.
I mean,

429
00:22:33.681 --> 00:22:38.470
they've been taught that America is this imperialist aggressor in everywhere.

430
00:22:38.480 --> 00:22:41.420
Boots have been on American boots had been on the ground.
Uh,

431
00:22:41.480 --> 00:22:44.830
evil has spread and white nationalism has spread.
That's what they're learning.

432
00:22:44.850 --> 00:22:47.360
You're like,
okay,
I can see where they got that.

433
00:22:47.390 --> 00:22:50.090
It's sad because it's an accurate.
Um,

434
00:22:50.180 --> 00:22:52.550
but I think that's kind of where it's coming from and that's what they're

435
00:22:52.551 --> 00:22:53.320
promulgating.

436
00:22:53.320 --> 00:22:55.930
<v 2>Yeah.
Are there parts of their right that you're not happy with?</v>

437
00:22:56.980 --> 00:22:59.650
<v 1>It definitely.
I mean,
if the old rate is even still a thing,</v>

438
00:22:59.651 --> 00:23:03.310
I feel like it's kind of had its heyday.
I literally prayed that it's had.

439
00:23:03.520 --> 00:23:06.160
Of course,
I don't like them.
I think there are a bunch of Internet trolls.

440
00:23:06.161 --> 00:23:08.320
There are people also who think that the world,

441
00:23:08.350 --> 00:23:10.570
the West is going to be one back through memes.

442
00:23:10.780 --> 00:23:14.710
I don't think there's anything wrong with me.
No,
they're all good means no.

443
00:23:14.711 --> 00:23:16.270
I thought that was the cause or anything wrong with that.

444
00:23:16.271 --> 00:23:18.040
But I don't think that's primarily where the,

445
00:23:18.310 --> 00:23:22.420
where the battle is flat and then I do get frustrated with people who can't ever

446
00:23:22.421 --> 00:23:27.310
criticize Trump when he says things.
For example,
and this was a while ago saying,

447
00:23:27.311 --> 00:23:31.090
okay,
we'll take away their guns and then due process or something like that,

448
00:23:31.091 --> 00:23:33.280
or where they can't refute him on trade,

449
00:23:33.281 --> 00:23:38.110
they can't push back at him at all or they try to paint him into like this

450
00:23:38.140 --> 00:23:43.060
almost Demi God savior.
That bothers me because,

451
00:23:43.180 --> 00:23:45.440
okay,
let's not pretend that he's Ronald Reagan.

452
00:23:45.441 --> 00:23:48.500
He might've even done better things than Ronald Reagan in a lot of ways,

453
00:23:48.710 --> 00:23:51.740
but let's not pretend that who he is as a man is Ronald Reagan,

454
00:23:51.741 --> 00:23:56.240
that he represents all of our conservative values.
I think it's okay to say,

455
00:23:56.241 --> 00:23:57.650
you know what?
As a Christian,

456
00:23:57.651 --> 00:23:59.990
I don't really agree with a lot of things that he says.

457
00:23:59.991 --> 00:24:03.050
A lot of the things that he's done,
I still like his policies,

458
00:24:03.200 --> 00:24:05.780
but I'm just going to be honest.
I don't love everything that he's done.

459
00:24:05.900 --> 00:24:10.040
The people that will not say that,
that bothers me,
I just don't get it.

460
00:24:10.130 --> 00:24:14.840
<v 2>Do you think that there's a like sort of a sickness around the Culta personality</v>

461
00:24:14.841 --> 00:24:18.500
related to our politicians,
the way we talk about them and think about them.

462
00:24:18.501 --> 00:24:21.500
I mean,
so you could take that with Trump from certain people,
you know,

463
00:24:21.501 --> 00:24:25.000
the certain just die hard mag of people who would never find fault and you could

464
00:24:25.001 --> 00:24:28.550
take that with the obsession with,
oh there's better with his shirt rolled up,

465
00:24:28.551 --> 00:24:32.180
standing on auditable and skateboarding and just the way we talk about them,

466
00:24:32.181 --> 00:24:33.800
like they're all celebrities or that,

467
00:24:34.090 --> 00:24:37.310
that they have the where with all to fix all our problems.

468
00:24:37.550 --> 00:24:39.410
It all actually feels gross to me.

469
00:24:39.411 --> 00:24:43.730
Like politics feels very gross to me for someone that talks about it as much as

470
00:24:43.731 --> 00:24:43.970
I should.

471
00:24:43.970 --> 00:24:44.780
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

472
00:24:44.780 --> 00:24:47.900
I don't know if it's because it's gotten so dramatize that it almost feels like

473
00:24:47.901 --> 00:24:49.010
our favorite soap opera.

474
00:24:49.011 --> 00:24:52.880
You know how someone has a character that they just love and can do no wrong.

475
00:24:52.881 --> 00:24:55.700
They're like,
I'm,
I'm fighting for this person in this show.

476
00:24:55.910 --> 00:24:59.930
It's almost that are our politics have become so celebritize,

477
00:24:59.931 --> 00:25:03.980
which really almost started with Barack Obama and so dramatize that people have

478
00:25:03.981 --> 00:25:07.610
picked their favorite characters and they feel like they have to pick one and

479
00:25:07.611 --> 00:25:09.650
there's,
there's no way.
Yeah,

480
00:25:09.680 --> 00:25:11.360
there's no way that they're going to pick the other one.

481
00:25:11.361 --> 00:25:16.361
But I also think it has to do with the fact that they see their enemy as so bad,

482
00:25:17.841 --> 00:25:22.841
as so crazy as so radical and the left is beating up on Trump so much and so

483
00:25:23.181 --> 00:25:25.220
unfairly that they,
they,

484
00:25:25.221 --> 00:25:27.770
I think they're honestly thinking and maybe with good intentions,

485
00:25:27.771 --> 00:25:31.220
why would I pile on that?
Sure.
Maybe I don't like some of the stuff that he does,

486
00:25:31.550 --> 00:25:33.620
but we never hear any of the good that he does.

487
00:25:33.621 --> 00:25:36.620
So I'm going to be a part of the group that talks about the good that he does

488
00:25:36.621 --> 00:25:39.800
and not the bad.
So maybe,
maybe those intentions are pure.

489
00:25:39.960 --> 00:25:41.400
<v 2>Yeah.
So I,
I do agree with that.</v>

490
00:25:41.401 --> 00:25:43.830
I think that there's a certain set of people that think,
well,
wait a minute,

491
00:25:43.831 --> 00:25:48.000
this guy is relentlessly getting attacked and lied about and Russia

492
00:25:48.001 --> 00:25:49.500
investigations that everything else.

493
00:25:49.740 --> 00:25:53.370
So when he says something like to me the the one that you hit on a,

494
00:25:53.620 --> 00:25:55.470
we'll take away the guns first and then the due process.

495
00:25:55.620 --> 00:25:59.010
To me that probably is the worst thing that he has said in,

496
00:25:59.220 --> 00:26:00.410
in the two plus years.
Yeah.

497
00:26:00.810 --> 00:26:05.810
And I could see why a decent person that would know that that's wrong wouldn't

498
00:26:05.910 --> 00:26:08.130
go crazy about it because a,

499
00:26:08.160 --> 00:26:12.840
he probably was probably just like sloppy language maybe.
Right?
Maybe,

500
00:26:13.200 --> 00:26:17.820
but B,
it's like everyone's attacking the guy constantly.
Like cut him some slack.

501
00:26:17.821 --> 00:26:20.010
But I guess that does it.
There's a danger in that too.

502
00:26:20.230 --> 00:26:23.350
<v 1>Yeah,
and I think it's that they look at his actions,
they keep saying,</v>

503
00:26:23.351 --> 00:26:25.550
or I should say we,
we look at his actions like,

504
00:26:25.840 --> 00:26:28.800
do I think that he is ideologically prolife?

505
00:26:28.810 --> 00:26:32.290
Do I think he really cares about abortion?
Probably not now.

506
00:26:32.291 --> 00:26:35.590
Maybe he's been awakened to like a lot of people have with the New York law and

507
00:26:35.591 --> 00:26:38.560
the Virginia Bill that didn't get passed and said,
okay,
that's really bad,

508
00:26:38.920 --> 00:26:42.730
but I don't really care what he personally thinks about abortion.

509
00:26:43.320 --> 00:26:47.580
He's been a prolife advocate and I think that's a good thing and I want him to

510
00:26:47.581 --> 00:26:49.620
advocate for the things that I believe in.

511
00:26:49.860 --> 00:26:53.820
And I always knew when I was always pretty confident in the fact that even if

512
00:26:53.821 --> 00:26:56.340
he's not an idea log,
which I think we all knew that he wasn't,

513
00:26:56.520 --> 00:27:00.180
he was going to surround himself by people that would push the values and the

514
00:27:00.181 --> 00:27:04.680
policies that conservatives believe in him.
That's nowadays,

515
00:27:04.681 --> 00:27:08.730
that's really all I care about.
It's almost all,
I wouldn't say all,

516
00:27:08.731 --> 00:27:11.220
but that's most of what I care about enough to get my vote.

517
00:27:11.310 --> 00:27:14.500
<v 2>So is that the irony I guess for Christian conservatives is that you needed a</v>

518
00:27:14.510 --> 00:27:17.730
guy that was going to do a play,
a dirty game and,

519
00:27:17.731 --> 00:27:21.750
and maybe you couldn't get Romney or McCain.
Yeah,
I mean tried it the other way.

520
00:27:21.751 --> 00:27:24.600
Like those guys weren't going to play in such a way because it's not just that

521
00:27:24.601 --> 00:27:26.070
you're fighting the candidate.

522
00:27:26.071 --> 00:27:28.820
You're also fighting the media establishment in the colleges and all that.

523
00:27:29.320 --> 00:27:33.460
<v 1>That's not how I thought of it,
because I didn't vote for him in the primaries.</v>

524
00:27:33.461 --> 00:27:34.600
In Lichen,
in the primaries,

525
00:27:34.601 --> 00:27:37.210
I actively talked about not voting for him in the primaries,

526
00:27:37.211 --> 00:27:38.470
and I honestly didn't understand.
