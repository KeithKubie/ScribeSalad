MICHEL DEGRAFF: So the course
grew out of a need and a desire

00:00:08.390 --> 00:00:11.790
to make linguistics available
to a broader range of students,

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:14.450
and within which we could
connect languages to larger

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:16.910
issues of culture and identity.

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:21.464
And as I'm from Haiti, and as
my research is Creole languages,

00:00:21.464 --> 00:00:22.880
I try to think of
ways in which we

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:26.990
can use the history
of Creole languages

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:30.050
to introduce larger issues
connected to linguistics,

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:34.149
identity, history,
sociology, education.

00:00:34.149 --> 00:00:35.690
So I've been teaching
this course now

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:38.277
for the past 10 years.
