00:00:08.407 --> 00:00:11.944
<i> Everywhere I ride you
 create a little gang.</i>

00:00:12.378 --> 00:00:15.748
<i>You attract young boys on bikes.</i>

00:00:15.782 --> 00:00:19.385
<i> They surround you,
 they call out to you.</i>

00:00:19.385 --> 00:00:21.988
<i> Some throw rocks,
 some aim them low</i>

00:00:21.988 --> 00:00:24.190
so it's just to get your
attention, some aim at you.

00:00:24.190 --> 00:00:27.293
Most of them want to just
ride bikes with you.

00:00:27.293 --> 00:00:31.264
What I found was that you
attract more attention,

00:00:31.264 --> 00:00:33.232
but you're attracting the
good kind of attention.

00:00:33.232 --> 00:00:36.168
You're attracting camaraderie,
you're attracting joy.

00:00:36.168 --> 00:00:39.939
<i> The problem for me was
 every single ride</i>

00:00:40.473 --> 00:00:43.809
<i> realizing that girls
 were unable to do this.</i>

00:00:43.843 --> 00:00:46.145
<i>This was the view of the girls.</i>

00:00:46.145 --> 00:00:48.247
They're watching me ride,
they're watching the joy,

00:00:48.247 --> 00:00:50.483
they're watching the boys
ride, and they're not allowed.

00:00:50.483 --> 00:00:51.518
And it's heartbreaking,

00:00:51.518 --> 00:00:53.686
and it's... unfair.

00:00:54.853 --> 00:00:57.323
What I started to look at was...

00:00:58.358 --> 00:00:59.925
the question that
would come up is

00:00:59.959 --> 00:01:01.861
does it even matter
whether girls ride bikes.

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:06.366
So girls can't ride, aren't
there bigger issues?

00:01:07.599 --> 00:01:10.369
The bike was a key component of

00:01:10.369 --> 00:01:12.572
our own women's rights
movement in the US.

00:01:12.572 --> 00:01:13.839
And I started digging back

00:01:13.839 --> 00:01:16.342
into our own history
of the Suffragettes

00:01:16.342 --> 00:01:20.145
and what was the
reaction when US women,

00:01:20.145 --> 00:01:22.348
when American women
started riding bikes.

00:01:24.484 --> 00:01:26.885
You know, Susan B. Anthony,
one of the, you know...

00:01:26.885 --> 00:01:32.692
the voices of that time, the
fact that she says that it was

00:01:32.692 --> 00:01:35.728
"a tool that has done more
for emancipating women

00:01:35.728 --> 00:01:39.698
than anything else in
the world", I mean...

00:01:39.698 --> 00:01:41.100
that's astounding.

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:43.636
Much like the young
women in Afghanistan

00:01:43.636 --> 00:01:45.104
that are now riding bikes.

00:01:45.104 --> 00:01:48.007
I found out that there was a
Men's National Cycling Team.

00:01:48.007 --> 00:01:51.277
No one I knew had ever
heard of such a thing.

00:01:51.277 --> 00:01:54.280
Men and boys ride
everywhere, you see them...

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:56.782
everywhere, across the streets

00:01:56.782 --> 00:01:59.051
it's the most common
mode of transportation.

00:01:59.285 --> 00:02:01.087
But never girls.

00:02:01.087 --> 00:02:03.489
But they're not, they're
never doing it for sports.

00:02:03.489 --> 00:02:05.424
Cycling is not an Afghan sport.

00:02:05.424 --> 00:02:07.827
Football and cricket
are the Afghan sports.

00:02:08.361 --> 00:02:10.863
And so, I asked to
meet this young man.

00:02:10.863 --> 00:02:11.964
It turns out he was a waiter

00:02:11.964 --> 00:02:14.767
at a cafe that I had
gone to before.

00:02:14.767 --> 00:02:17.837
And then the really
fascinating thing was

00:02:18.837 --> 00:02:20.340
he found out that I rode bikes

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:23.009
and invited me to come for
a ride with the team.

00:02:23.009 --> 00:02:24.744
Of course, I
immediately say yes.

00:02:24.744 --> 00:02:25.844
Although I am a
little nervous about

00:02:25.844 --> 00:02:27.246
riding on the Afghan highways.

00:02:27.246 --> 00:02:29.015
Trucking, it's a trucking route.

00:02:29.015 --> 00:02:32.251
You've got the big Pakistani
jingle trucks blowing by.

00:02:32.251 --> 00:02:33.553
There's no rules of the road.

00:02:33.553 --> 00:02:36.689
Most Afghans have not taken
a drivers license test.

00:02:37.857 --> 00:02:40.026
<i> And we meet at this
 petrol station.</i>

00:02:40.026 --> 00:02:41.293
<i> As we're all gathering,</i>

00:02:41.293 --> 00:02:43.829
<i> you see boys starting to come
 from different directions.</i>

00:02:43.829 --> 00:02:45.865
<i> The coach arrived in his car.</i>

00:02:46.632 --> 00:02:50.002
And he's got his...
assistant with him.

00:02:50.002 --> 00:02:53.106
A young woman, beautiful,
strong features.

00:02:53.106 --> 00:02:54.640
She looks tough.

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:57.610
And he's furious.

00:02:57.610 --> 00:02:59.645
"Why has nobody told me that
there's a foreign woman

00:02:59.645 --> 00:03:00.980
coming to ride with
the men's team?

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:02.681
It's putting her at risk,
it's putting you at risk."

00:03:02.681 --> 00:03:06.219
And he's like, in my
face, yelling at me.

00:03:06.886 --> 00:03:08.755
And once he gets it
out of his system

00:03:08.755 --> 00:03:12.157
'cause that very kind of
Afghan to just get it out,

00:03:12.157 --> 00:03:13.993
then he shakes my hand,
he says, "welcome."

00:03:13.993 --> 00:03:15.461
( audience laughter )

00:03:15.461 --> 00:03:16.596
Okay...

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:20.333
<i> "Why are you here?"
And I said, "well, I ride bikes.</i>

00:03:20.333 --> 00:03:22.935
<i> I used to be a sports
 trainer in a prior life.</i>

00:03:22.935 --> 00:03:24.504
<i> And I'm a mountain biker.</i>

00:03:25.004 --> 00:03:28.775
And the boys, you know, invited
me to come and ride with them.

00:03:28.808 --> 00:03:30.242
I didn't mean any offense,

00:03:30.242 --> 00:03:31.844
they didn't tell me
anything about you.

00:03:32.712 --> 00:03:34.814
And, who is this
woman with you?"

00:03:34.814 --> 00:03:38.117
And he says, "well, this is
Mariam. She's my assistant,

00:03:38.117 --> 00:03:41.020
but she's also on the Afghan
National Women's team."

00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:42.554
I'm like, "women's team...

00:03:43.021 --> 00:03:44.190
How did this come to be?

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:46.325
I've been looking for
women for three years.

00:03:46.325 --> 00:03:48.227
I've never met one family that

00:03:48.227 --> 00:03:49.895
would allow their
girl to ride a bike.

00:03:49.895 --> 00:03:52.632
Or that... any girl I've
ever met or

00:03:52.632 --> 00:03:54.333
woman who has
ridden a bike."

00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:58.838
And he said that when he
started the men's team,

00:03:58.838 --> 00:04:00.306
which is pre-Taliban time.

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:03.476
And then had to stop because
of the Taliban time,

00:04:03.509 --> 00:04:05.310
he had wanted to
start a girls' team.

00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:06.746
He didn't see any reason not to.

00:04:06.746 --> 00:04:08.547
And he started with
his own daughters.

00:04:09.148 --> 00:04:12.985
As is always the case, it's you
know, that family connection.

00:04:12.985 --> 00:04:16.289
He wanted his girls to
experience the joy of riding.

00:04:16.289 --> 00:04:18.024
I asked if I could
meet the team.

00:04:18.024 --> 00:04:20.659
Of course, he allowed and
I met with the girls.

00:04:20.659 --> 00:04:23.696
And said, "how can I help?
I mean, this...

00:04:23.696 --> 00:04:26.499
we are kinda coming full
circle in my journey here.

00:04:26.499 --> 00:04:30.003
Like, how do I help support
these young women?"

00:04:30.003 --> 00:04:32.038
This is exactly what I
had always hoped was that

00:04:32.038 --> 00:04:35.575
we'd find a way that we
could normalize bikes

00:04:35.575 --> 00:04:38.378
so that we could get girls
bikes to get to schools.

00:04:38.378 --> 00:04:40.612
And so that we could reduce
the gender violence.

00:04:40.612 --> 00:04:43.549
So that when girls are
walking the gauntlet

00:04:43.549 --> 00:04:46.252
in an urban environment
where they're

00:04:46.252 --> 00:04:47.386
getting acid thrown at them,

00:04:47.386 --> 00:04:49.821
where they're kidnapped,
where there's rocks thrown,

00:04:49.821 --> 00:04:51.391
where they're being attacked,

00:04:52.758 --> 00:04:54.593
we can give them a
really simple tool.

00:04:54.593 --> 00:04:58.097
When they're in rural areas
and can't access medical care

00:04:58.097 --> 00:04:59.766
or can't access a school

00:04:59.766 --> 00:05:02.201
they have the ability to
travel a greater distance.

00:05:02.201 --> 00:05:04.069
And we need, then we
need fewer resources,

00:05:04.069 --> 00:05:05.805
we don't need as many schools

00:05:05.805 --> 00:05:07.707
if we can bring more
people to them.

00:05:07.707 --> 00:05:10.209
Then we can spend that
money on more teachers.
