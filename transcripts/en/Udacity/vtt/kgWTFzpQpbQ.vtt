00:00:00.070 --> 00:00:02.482
First let's calculate
what the discount is.

00:00:02.482 --> 00:00:05.248
Let's convert 30% to a decimal.

00:00:05.248 --> 00:00:12.461
And I'm going to multiply that by my
$25 and that gives me $7.5 or $7.50.

00:00:12.461 --> 00:00:14.260
That's just how much the discount is.

00:00:14.260 --> 00:00:19.726
So I save 7.50 which means
I'm paying 25.00- 7.50.

00:00:19.726 --> 00:00:24.213
So, it looks like I'm only going to
have to pay 17.50 for these earings.

00:00:24.213 --> 00:00:26.070
If you got that right, good work.

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:29.490
And if not, go back through and
go through the steps of the solution.

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:30.440
There is a lot going on here.
