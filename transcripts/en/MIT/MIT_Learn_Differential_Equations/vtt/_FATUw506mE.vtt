00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:01.620
GILBERT STRANG: OK.

00:00:01.620 --> 00:00:06.560
So speaking today about
separable equations.

00:00:06.560 --> 00:00:11.020
These are, in principle,
the easiest to solve.

00:00:11.020 --> 00:00:13.620
They include nonlinear
equations but they

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:16.510
have a special feature
that makes them easy,

00:00:16.510 --> 00:00:19.470
makes them approachable.

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:24.370
And that special feature
is that the right hand

00:00:24.370 --> 00:00:27.760
side of the equation
separates into some function

00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:32.830
of t divided by or multiplied
by some function of y.

00:00:32.830 --> 00:00:37.310
The t and the y have separated
on the right hand side.

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:42.740
And for example, dy/dt equal y
plus t would not be separable.

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:45.570
They'd be very simple
but not separable.

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:49.690
Separable means that we can
keep those two separately and do

00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:54.220
an integral of f and an integral
of g and we're in business.

00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:55.650
OK.

00:00:55.650 --> 00:00:57.620
Examples.

00:00:57.620 --> 00:01:01.060
Suppose that f of y is 1.

00:01:01.060 --> 00:01:04.769
Then we have this simplest
differential equation of all,

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:08.030
dy/dt is some function of t.

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:09.840
That's what calculus is for.

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:13.660
y is the integral of g.

00:01:13.660 --> 00:01:16.770
Suppose there was no t.

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:20.780
Just a 1 over f of y,
with g of t equal one.

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:23.156
Then I bring the f of y up.

00:01:23.156 --> 00:01:26.610
I integrate the [? f ?] dy.

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:30.750
And moving the dt there,
I'm just integrating dt.

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:34.440
So the right hand
side would just be t.

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:37.450
And the left hand side is
an integral we have to do.

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:39.030
That's the minimum
amount of work

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:41.200
to solve a
differential equation.

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:44.570
But the point is, with y
and t separate, we just

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:47.450
have integration to do.

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:55.420
And here is the case when there
is both a g of t and an f of y.

00:01:55.420 --> 00:02:00.560
Then let me just emphasize
what's happening here.

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:03.900
The f of y I am
moving up with a dy.

00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:07.030
The dt I'm moving
up with a g of t dt.

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:12.720
So I g of t dt equals f of y
dy and I integrate both sides.

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:17.760
The left side is an integral
of y with respect to y.

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:19.960
The right hand side is
an integral with respect

00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:22.630
to t or a dummy variable s.

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:24.980
The integral going from 0 to t.

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:29.520
This integral going
from y of 0 to y of t.

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:32.700
Those are the two
integrations to be done.

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:36.860
And you will get examples
of seperable equations.

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:40.440
And what you have to
do is two integrals.

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:44.220
And then there's this one
little catch at the end.

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:49.620
This is some function
of y when I integrate.

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:51.760
But I usually like
to have the solution

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:56.380
to a differential equation
just y equal something.

00:02:56.380 --> 00:02:58.860
And you'll see in the examples.

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:01.810
I have to solve it
for y because this

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:03.560
isn't going to give me just y.

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:06.650
It's going to give me some
expression involving y.

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:09.270
So let me do examples.

00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:10.330
Let me do examples.

00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:12.960
You see why it's correct.

00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:13.590
OK.

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:14.592
So here are examples.

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:27.650
So let me take, what about the
equation dy/dt equals t over y.

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:29.530
Clearly separable.

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:31.930
The function's f.

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:33.840
g of t is just t.

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:35.780
f of y is just y.

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:44.000
I combine those to
y dy equalling t dt.

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:47.100
You see I've picked a pretty
straightforward example.

00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:52.320
Now I'm integrating both
sides from y of 0 to y of t

00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:53.530
on the left.

00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:55.700
And from 0 to t on the right.

00:03:55.700 --> 00:03:59.440
And of course that
is 1/2 t squared.

00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:05.510
And the left hand
side is 1/2 y squared

00:04:05.510 --> 00:04:06.930
between these two limits.

00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:11.500
So I'm getting the integral
of that is 1/2 y squared.

00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:17.240
So up top I have 1/2
y of t squared minus,

00:04:17.240 --> 00:04:22.050
at the bottom end,
1/2 y of 0 squared

00:04:22.050 --> 00:04:25.304
equalling the right
hand side 1/2 t squared.

00:04:28.090 --> 00:04:35.380
So you see, we got a function
of y equal to a function of t.

00:04:35.380 --> 00:04:39.510
And the equation
is solved, really.

00:04:39.510 --> 00:04:42.100
That differential
equation is solved.

00:04:42.100 --> 00:04:48.270
But I haven't found it in the
form y of t equal something.

00:04:48.270 --> 00:04:49.480
But I can do that.

00:04:49.480 --> 00:04:52.460
I just move this
to the other side.

00:04:52.460 --> 00:04:55.642
So that will go to the
other side with a plus.

00:05:00.230 --> 00:05:04.730
And then I'll cancel the 1/2.

00:05:04.730 --> 00:05:06.910
And then I'll take
the square root.

00:05:06.910 --> 00:05:17.110
So the solution y of
t is the square root

00:05:17.110 --> 00:05:22.100
of y of 0 squared
plus t squared.

00:05:26.120 --> 00:05:29.760
That's the solution to
the differential equation.

00:05:29.760 --> 00:05:34.240
Maybe I make a small
comment on this equation.

00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:41.950
Because it's essential to begin
to look for dangerous points.

00:05:41.950 --> 00:05:45.500
Singular points where
things are not quite right.

00:05:45.500 --> 00:05:49.420
Here the dangerous point
is clearly y equal zero.

00:05:49.420 --> 00:05:54.070
If I start at y of 0 equals
zero then I'm not sure what.

00:05:54.070 --> 00:05:58.580
What's the solution to that
equation if I start at y of 0

00:05:58.580 --> 00:05:59.356
equals 0?

00:06:02.920 --> 00:06:04.880
I'm starting with a 0 over 0.

00:06:04.880 --> 00:06:09.790
What a way to begin your life,
starting with a 0 over 0.

00:06:09.790 --> 00:06:12.140
This, well, actually
the solution

00:06:12.140 --> 00:06:13.850
would still be correct.

00:06:13.850 --> 00:06:18.040
If y of 0 is 0, I would get
the square root of t squared.

00:06:18.040 --> 00:06:21.160
I would get t.

00:06:21.160 --> 00:06:32.170
So y of 0 equals 0 allows
the solution y equals t.

00:06:32.170 --> 00:06:33.840
And that is a solution.

00:06:33.840 --> 00:06:38.930
That if y is equal
to t then dy/dt is 1.

00:06:38.930 --> 00:06:44.410
And on the right hand side
t over y is t over t is 1.

00:06:44.410 --> 00:06:46.160
So the equation is solved.

00:06:46.160 --> 00:06:49.140
But my point was,
there's got to be

00:06:49.140 --> 00:06:54.070
something going a little
strange when y of 0 is 0.

00:06:54.070 --> 00:06:58.490
And what happens strangely
is there are other solutions.

00:06:58.490 --> 00:07:02.970
I like, I think, y
equal negative t.

00:07:02.970 --> 00:07:04.580
And more, probably.

00:07:04.580 --> 00:07:11.710
But if y is equal to negative t,
then its derivative is minus 1.

00:07:11.710 --> 00:07:15.490
And on the right hand side, I
have t over negative t minus 1

00:07:15.490 --> 00:07:17.220
again.

00:07:17.220 --> 00:07:19.180
So the equation is solved.

00:07:19.180 --> 00:07:20.830
That's a perfectly
good solution.

00:07:20.830 --> 00:07:22.090
That's a second solution.

00:07:22.090 --> 00:07:26.360
It's an equation with
more than one solution.

00:07:26.360 --> 00:07:29.210
And we'll have to
think, when can we

00:07:29.210 --> 00:07:31.370
guarantee there is just
one solution, which

00:07:31.370 --> 00:07:33.150
is of course what we want.

00:07:33.150 --> 00:07:33.890
OK.

00:07:33.890 --> 00:07:37.290
I'd better do another
example going beyond this.

00:07:37.290 --> 00:07:41.170
And maybe the logistic
equation is a good one.

00:07:41.170 --> 00:07:43.190
So that's separable.

00:07:43.190 --> 00:07:46.210
And it's going to
be a little harder.

00:07:46.210 --> 00:07:47.370
So let me do that one.

00:07:47.370 --> 00:07:54.420
dy/dt is y minus y
squared, let's say.

00:07:54.420 --> 00:07:57.280
The logistic equation.

00:07:57.280 --> 00:08:00.770
Linear term minus
a quadratic term.

00:08:00.770 --> 00:08:04.850
That's separable because
the g of t part is 1.

00:08:04.850 --> 00:08:06.720
And what's the f of y?

00:08:06.720 --> 00:08:10.600
Remember f of y-- I want
to put that on the y side.

00:08:10.600 --> 00:08:13.140
But it's going to show
up in the denominator.

00:08:13.140 --> 00:08:20.450
So I have dy over y minus
y squared equaling dt.

00:08:20.450 --> 00:08:26.700
And I have to integrate both
sides to get the solution y.

00:08:26.700 --> 00:08:30.710
Now, integrating the right hand
side is of course a picnic.

00:08:30.710 --> 00:08:33.049
I get t.

00:08:33.049 --> 00:08:34.880
But integrating
the left hand side,

00:08:34.880 --> 00:08:40.230
I have to either know how,
or look up, or figure out

00:08:40.230 --> 00:08:43.710
the integral of 1 over
y minus y squared.

00:08:43.710 --> 00:08:49.890
So let me just make a little
comment about integrating,

00:08:49.890 --> 00:08:54.200
because examples often
have this problem.

00:08:54.200 --> 00:08:59.500
Integrating when
there is a polynomial

00:08:59.500 --> 00:09:03.790
a quadratic in the denominator.

00:09:03.790 --> 00:09:05.960
There are different
ways to do it.

00:09:05.960 --> 00:09:10.860
And the time that we'll really
see this type of problem

00:09:10.860 --> 00:09:14.200
is when we discuss
Laplace transforms.

00:09:14.200 --> 00:09:19.050
So I'm going to save the details
of the method until then.

00:09:19.050 --> 00:09:22.390
But let me give the
name of the method.

00:09:22.390 --> 00:09:25.850
The name is partial
fractions, which

00:09:25.850 --> 00:09:28.160
is a method of integration.

00:09:28.160 --> 00:09:30.335
Partial fractions.

00:09:34.020 --> 00:09:36.240
And I'll just say
here what it means.

00:09:36.240 --> 00:09:41.030
It means that I want to write
this 1 over y minus y squared

00:09:41.030 --> 00:09:43.700
in a nicer way.

00:09:43.700 --> 00:09:47.500
What over y minus y squared can
be split up into two fractions?

00:09:47.500 --> 00:09:49.440
Those are the partial fractions.

00:09:49.440 --> 00:09:51.890
One fraction is-- so
I'm going to factor

00:09:51.890 --> 00:10:02.490
that y minus y squared
factors into y and 1 minus y.

00:10:02.490 --> 00:10:07.160
The partial fractions will
be some number over the y

00:10:07.160 --> 00:10:11.850
and some other number
over the 1 minus y.

00:10:11.850 --> 00:10:14.080
This is just algebra now.

00:10:14.080 --> 00:10:15.730
Partial fractions
is just algebra.

00:10:15.730 --> 00:10:17.570
It's not calculus.

00:10:17.570 --> 00:10:23.050
So I factored the y minus y
squared into these two terms.

00:10:23.050 --> 00:10:27.710
You see that if I come
to a common denominator,

00:10:27.710 --> 00:10:30.130
if I put these two
fractions together,

00:10:30.130 --> 00:10:33.860
then the denominator
is going to be that.

00:10:33.860 --> 00:10:38.490
And the numerator, if I choose
a and b correctly, will be 1.

00:10:38.490 --> 00:10:43.620
So, integrating this, I can
separately integrate a over y

00:10:43.620 --> 00:10:50.670
dy and b dy over 1 minus y.

00:10:50.670 --> 00:10:52.580
And those are easy.

00:10:52.580 --> 00:10:54.540
So partial fractions,
after you go

00:10:54.540 --> 00:10:58.730
to the effort of
finding the fractions,

00:10:58.730 --> 00:11:01.750
then you have separate
integrations that you can do.

00:11:01.750 --> 00:11:05.420
That integral is just
a times the log of y.

00:11:05.420 --> 00:11:08.190
And this is maybe
b times-- maybe

00:11:08.190 --> 00:11:12.570
it's minus b times
the log of 1 minus y.

00:11:12.570 --> 00:11:16.280
So we've integrated.

00:11:16.280 --> 00:11:18.470
Just remember though.

00:11:18.470 --> 00:11:22.370
That with this
particular equation,

00:11:22.370 --> 00:11:26.450
the logistic equation, we didn't
have to use partial fractions.

00:11:26.450 --> 00:11:29.520
We could have done-- we've
just seen how, thinking

00:11:29.520 --> 00:11:32.190
of it as a separable equation.

00:11:32.190 --> 00:11:37.780
But that logistic equation
had the very neat approach.

00:11:37.780 --> 00:11:39.780
Much quicker, much nicer.

00:11:39.780 --> 00:11:43.770
We just introduced
z equal 1 over y.

00:11:43.770 --> 00:11:47.310
We looked at the unknown
1 over y, called it z,

00:11:47.310 --> 00:11:50.920
found the equation for
z, and it was linear.

00:11:50.920 --> 00:11:52.710
And we can write
down its solution.

00:11:52.710 --> 00:11:55.800
So when we can do that it wins.

00:11:55.800 --> 00:11:58.500
But if we don't
see how to do that,

00:11:58.500 --> 00:12:02.170
partial fractions is
the systematic way.

00:12:02.170 --> 00:12:04.470
One fraction, another fraction.

00:12:04.470 --> 00:12:06.230
Integrate those fractions.

00:12:06.230 --> 00:12:07.360
Put the answer together.

00:12:07.360 --> 00:12:10.600
And then, and then,
at the end, this

00:12:10.600 --> 00:12:18.360
is some integral
depending on y equal to t.

00:12:18.360 --> 00:12:21.000
And to finish the
problem perfectly,

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:25.820
I would have to solve
for y as a function of t.

00:12:25.820 --> 00:12:30.670
And that was what came out
so beautifully by letting 1

00:12:30.670 --> 00:12:32.580
over y bz.

00:12:32.580 --> 00:12:36.580
We got an easy formula for z and
then we had the formula for y.

00:12:36.580 --> 00:12:39.780
This we would integrate
easily enough.

00:12:39.780 --> 00:12:44.650
But then we have to solve
to find that formula for y.

00:12:44.650 --> 00:12:45.210
OK.

00:12:45.210 --> 00:12:48.640
That's a more serious example.

00:12:48.640 --> 00:12:51.740
This example was
a very simple one.

00:12:51.740 --> 00:12:56.780
You can do other examples
of separable equations.

00:12:56.780 --> 00:12:59.811
y and t integrated separately.

00:12:59.811 --> 00:13:00.310
Good.

00:13:00.310 --> 00:13:02.130
Thank you.
