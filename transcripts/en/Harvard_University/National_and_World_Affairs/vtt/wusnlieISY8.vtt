00:00:04.010 --> 00:00:06.980
Panzi Hospital    

00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:09.589
was founded

00:00:09.589 --> 00:00:13.869
under very special circumstances.

00:00:13.869 --> 00:00:18.909
They were conditions of war. 

00:00:18.909 --> 00:00:23.240
During the war of 1996, I found myself 

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:26.470
as a refugee of Bukavu. 

00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:29.069
And while I was there, 

00:00:29.069 --> 00:00:30.709
I noticed something abnormal:

00:00:30.709 --> 00:00:35.200
very high rates of maternal morality.

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:36.340
Often these deaths
0:00:36.340,0:00:39.280
 were caused by an inability 

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:40.870
to perform 

00:00:40.870 --> 00:00:44.790
simple cesarian procedures.

00:00:44.790 --> 00:00:50.590
Women had to travel by donkey

00:00:50.590 --> 00:00:59.140
extremely long distances.

00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:03.620
 I thought we could do something to help them, 

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:07.100
but the biggest surprise is that the first patient 

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:10.210
we operated on didn't need a cesarian, she was a woman 

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:17.790
who had survived sexual violence. 

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:22.010
Some of the fistulas that result from sexual violence 

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:23.540
are a result of knives or guns 

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:27.850
or broken bottles. So those things can cause different amounts of tissue damage

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:30.130
and destruction.

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:34.380
A fistula is just a hole, really. It's an abnormal connection between two 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:37.080
organs where there should not be a connection. 

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:39.479
So, for example, a vessico-vaginal fistula- the most common

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:40.900
thing seen over there- 

00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:44.509
is a connection between the bladder and the vagina so that these women just 

00:01:44.509 --> 00:01:46.170
constantly leak urine. 

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:49.380
They also get recto-vaginal fistula, which is just a connection between the rectum

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:50.290
 and the vagina 

00:01:50.290 --> 00:01:53.950
so that they pass stool continuously. And again, some women

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:55.990
 have both. 

00:01:55.990 --> 00:01:57.670
Today our clinic 

00:01:57.670 --> 00:02:01.320
treats more than 3,00 women each year. 

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:08.090
That's why we call on 

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:11.879
different organizations,

00:02:11.879 --> 00:02:15.650
 especially our collaboration with 

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:17.909
HHI (the Harvard Humanitarian Initiative)

00:02:17.909 --> 00:02:19.609
We do exchanges of doctors 

00:02:19.609 --> 00:02:22.589
and experience 

00:02:22.589 --> 00:02:25.340
to take better care of these women. 

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:30.440
The doctors that we send over lecture and teach in the classroom situation 

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:33.959
and also go into clinic,

00:02:33.959 --> 00:02:39.399
 and also the OR to repair these fistulas. 

00:02:39.399 --> 00:02:40.959
For me 

00:02:40.959 --> 00:02:44.289
it was an incredible discovery to see 

00:02:44.289 --> 00:02:45.159
how

00:02:45.159 --> 00:02:47.369
women could arrive in

00:02:47.369 --> 00:02:49.489
a state of destruction, 

00:02:49.489 --> 00:02:51.109
of despair, 

00:02:51.109 --> 00:02:53.299
of abandonment,

00:02:53.299 --> 00:02:56.429
of stigmatization, of social rejection. 

00:02:56.429 --> 00:03:02.999
[Children singing]

00:03:02.999 --> 00:03:04.120
But I then see the 

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:06.179
strength with which they fight 

00:03:06.179 --> 00:03:07.689
to rediscover 

00:03:07.689 --> 00:03:12.919
their dignity, 

00:03:12.919 --> 00:03:14.679
I think it is 

00:03:14.679 --> 00:03:15.549
the strength with which they fight to become themselves again, 

00:03:15.549 --> 00:03:21.989
I think it is their strength that pushes me to do more.
