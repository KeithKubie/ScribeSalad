00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:03.170
So, what else do we want to make a report on?

00:00:03.170 --> 00:00:08.580
&gt;&gt; I think it would be nice to, as a way of

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:12.950
gauging in the future how many V.I.P verse general admission tickets to sell.

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:14.180
&gt;&gt; That we sold over time?

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:16.410
&gt;&gt; Well, keeping track of that, so that you know maybe

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:18.940
for a concert in a year from now. I'll be able

00:00:18.940 --> 00:00:21.710
to say historically this many people buy VIP and I'll be

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:25.440
able to sort of, you know, allocate the space appropriately or

00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:26.070
something like that.

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:26.700
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:28.040
&gt;&gt; So yeah, tickets over time.

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:32.340
&gt;&gt; Yeah, so that's a really similar chart to what we've already made. So we

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:35.660
can actually just keep using the same report and then save as at the end

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:36.080
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:37.920
&gt;&gt; to have a completely different report. Cool.

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:40.960
&gt;&gt; So we have our grouping here already by ticket

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:43.990
type. But the other thing that it sounded like was really

00:00:43.990 --> 00:00:47.470
important was the over time thing. And so, we have

00:00:47.470 --> 00:00:49.560
that one field. What's that one field that we have on?

00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:50.480
&gt;&gt; Purchase date, I think?

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:52.850
&gt;&gt; Purchase date, exactly. Yeah, so, we'll

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:54.760
want to group by purchase date also. And

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:57.040
so we can create another grouping. That

00:00:57.040 --> 00:00:58.690
we can drag straight into our summary report.

00:00:58.690 --> 00:01:04.744
&gt;&gt; Cool. Okay so let's go down to Attendee &gt; Purchase Date.

00:01:04.744 --> 00:01:05.950
&gt;&gt; Well let's think about this really quick before

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:07.750
dragging it in. Do you think that you'd want

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:09.940
to group by purchase date first? Or do you

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:11.990
think you'd want to group by the ticket type first?
