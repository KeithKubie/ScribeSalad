00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:07.430
JESS: So welcome to our panel
discussion on why food matters.

00:00:07.430 --> 00:00:09.480
So today we have
with us Sam, who

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:11.690
is the second-generation
owner of Bi-Rite

00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:15.670
Market and the founder of the
Bi-Rite family of businesses,

00:00:15.670 --> 00:00:19.410
which includes the two San
Francisco markets, Bi-Rite

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:23.250
Creamery, Bi-Rite Catering,
and Bi-Rite Farms.

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:27.810
Sam also co-founded and is
on the board of 18 Reasons.

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:30.410
And then we have Sarah,
who is the Executive

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:32.720
Director of 18 Reasons.

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:35.360
She's worked on food-related
projects in the Bay Area

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:37.110
since 2008.

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:39.740
She launched the Bay
Area's first Market Match,

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:42.880
which gives farmers' market
customers who use food stamps

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:45.100
extra funds to
spend at the market,

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:47.060
and a Veggie RX
program that helps

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:49.280
diabetes patients
increase their produce

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:52.480
consumption while measuring
positive health outcomes.

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:55.650
In 2011, she founded the
nonprofit Three Squares, which

00:00:55.650 --> 00:00:59.070
merged with 18 Reasons in 2013.

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:01.840
And I'll let them introduce
themselves and tell you

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:05.330
a little bit more about their
backgrounds in a second.

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:06.810
But first I would
just want to say,

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:08.660
please stick around
after the panel

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:10.420
to continue the conversation.

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:13.720
And there will be
ice cream, so I'm

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:16.060
sure that had nothing to
do with why so many of you

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:17.830
are here today.

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:22.522
But with that, let's
welcome our panel to Google.

00:01:22.522 --> 00:01:26.320
[APPLAUSE]

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:29.140
So I'd love to start with
your personal stories.

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:31.020
I don't know if one of
you wants to go first.

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:32.270
SARAH NELSON: I'm going first.

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:33.810
SAM MOGANNAM: OK.

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:35.440
SARAH NELSON: So hi, I'm Sarah.

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:38.970
And I've been working in
nonprofits for a long time.

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:41.100
I originally started
out working in the arts,

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:43.350
and when I moved to San
Francisco eight years ago,

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:45.080
I found a job working in food.

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:48.000
And it had never really
occurred to me to work in food.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.140
Food was just something
that I loved and did

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:52.860
and ate every day three times.

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:55.880
But it turns out there's a
whole wonderful world of people

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:57.680
working in food and
a lot of great things

00:01:57.680 --> 00:01:58.840
to do in the field.

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:01.040
So I started working
for farmers' markets,

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:04.880
as Jess said, and I think people
think that farmers' markets are

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:07.190
just a bunch of
farmers who all agreed

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:09.910
to show up at a certain
place on a certain time.

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:12.810
And that's kind of the illusion
that we want you to have

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:15.390
but, in fact, farmers' markets
are organized by nonprofits.

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:17.380
The one I worked for
runs 60 farmers' markets

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:18.730
all over the Bay Area.

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:22.160
So they are organized
and marketed

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:24.870
and permits are managed
and so forth by nonprofits.

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:27.980
So I was running nutrition
education programs,

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:30.580
writing grants, which was how
I started out in nonprofits,

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:31.724
was raising money.

00:02:31.724 --> 00:02:33.140
And then left the
farmers' markets

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:35.940
to start my own nonprofit
based around cooking.

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:37.780
We were doing cooking
demos in markets,

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:42.050
and I felt that hands-on cooking
experience is so much more

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:45.820
valuable than watching people
cook, whether it's live

00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:46.382
or on TV.

00:02:46.382 --> 00:02:47.840
We were talking
about this at lunch

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:49.620
that people spend
seven hours a week

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:52.390
watching cooking shows on TV
and 30 minutes a week actually

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:53.190
cooking.

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:55.920
So clearly watching
people cook is not really

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:57.380
getting them to cook.

00:02:57.380 --> 00:03:00.760
So I started a nonprofit to
teach free cooking classes

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:03.390
to low-income adults and
kids all over the Bay Area

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:05.737
and, through that, met Sam.

00:03:05.737 --> 00:03:08.070
We asked him to come and speak
at one of our fundraisers

00:03:08.070 --> 00:03:09.950
and got involved that way.

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:13.110
We started a film festival
together as a fundraiser.

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:16.375
And when the time
was right, 18 Reasons

00:03:16.375 --> 00:03:18.500
was kind of looking to go
in the direction of doing

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:20.050
more free programming.

00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:21.740
We were looking to
raise more money

00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:24.240
and thought that paid classes
might be a way to raise money,

00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:26.290
and it all kind of
worked out perfectly

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:29.620
that we merged the organizations
together into 18 Reasons

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:32.580
as it is today, which is
a nonprofit offering both

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:35.380
paid classes and events in
our classroom on 18th Street

00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:37.640
in the mission as well as
our free Cooking Matters

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:38.849
program out in the community.

00:03:38.849 --> 00:03:40.473
SAM MOGANNAM: And
I'm just going to say

00:03:40.473 --> 00:03:42.580
it's a pretty cool, unique
model, because we've

00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:46.270
got a combination of earned
income because of the paid

00:03:46.270 --> 00:03:48.880
classes and contributed
income that we get

00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:52.891
through either donations
or through grant writing

00:03:52.891 --> 00:03:54.390
and I think a really
important model

00:03:54.390 --> 00:03:59.720
for the future sustainability
of nonprofits going forward.

00:03:59.720 --> 00:04:04.320
There's got to be a
combination of both, I think.

00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:06.730
So I'm Sam Mogannam.

00:04:06.730 --> 00:04:08.800
As Jess said, I'm the
second-generation owner

00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:11.190
of Bi-Rite.

00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:19.320
I grew up in it and wanted
nothing but to get out of it

00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:20.029
my whole youth.

00:04:20.029 --> 00:04:22.380
I literally spent
the years from 6

00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:26.990
until I was 17 working
at my father's store.

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:30.000
My father and uncle bought
the business in 1964,

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:32.450
so well over 50 years ago.

00:04:32.450 --> 00:04:34.480
And the market itself
has been on 18th Street

00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:37.990
since 1940, so
over 75 years now.

00:04:37.990 --> 00:04:41.500
And many of you who have been
in San Francisco long enough

00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:45.500
have seen how rapidly the
city, especially its heritage

00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:47.070
businesses, have changed.

00:04:47.070 --> 00:04:50.020
And it's something that
I'm very proud of, the fact

00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:55.740
that the single-story building
with the original facade

00:04:55.740 --> 00:04:58.660
has lasted as long as it has.

00:04:58.660 --> 00:05:01.050
So after school, I would go
and I would sweep the floors,

00:05:01.050 --> 00:05:02.280
and then I learned how
to stock the shelves

00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:03.488
in then ring on the register.

00:05:03.488 --> 00:05:05.920
Eventually, I was buying
wine when I was 15.

00:05:05.920 --> 00:05:07.770
I had no idea what
it tasted like,

00:05:07.770 --> 00:05:11.510
but I was making these beautiful
displays, and at one point

00:05:11.510 --> 00:05:14.070
Bi-Rite was selling
more Beringer White

00:05:14.070 --> 00:05:17.410
Zinfandel than any other
grocery store in San Francisco.

00:05:17.410 --> 00:05:21.150
And all the Gallo sales reps
came down and descended on it,

00:05:21.150 --> 00:05:23.970
like they had the Regional
Sales Director come in.

00:05:23.970 --> 00:05:25.710
It's like, who is
the wine buyer here?

00:05:25.710 --> 00:05:28.220
And my dad introduced
me to them.

00:05:28.220 --> 00:05:30.760
And they're like going, what?

00:05:30.760 --> 00:05:33.702
And they were offering
me jobs, saying, well,

00:05:33.702 --> 00:05:35.160
when you graduate
from high school,

00:05:35.160 --> 00:05:37.830
we want to put you into our
management development program.

00:05:37.830 --> 00:05:41.147
I was like, I don't know
if I want to do that.

00:05:41.147 --> 00:05:42.730
But when I graduated
from high school,

00:05:42.730 --> 00:05:45.690
I thought I was going
to become a hotel guy,

00:05:45.690 --> 00:05:50.510
and my intent was to eventually
get to Cornell and started off

00:05:50.510 --> 00:05:54.200
here at City College of San
Francisco and tried to get

00:05:54.200 --> 00:05:56.349
a job in a hotel and couldn't.

00:05:56.349 --> 00:05:57.890
Nobody would give
me a job, because I

00:05:57.890 --> 00:05:59.460
didn't have any experience.

00:05:59.460 --> 00:06:01.520
I think all of us
have been there.

00:06:01.520 --> 00:06:04.750
And it forced me to
kind of seek work

00:06:04.750 --> 00:06:06.900
in hospitality
outside of hotels.

00:06:06.900 --> 00:06:10.250
And so I started
applying in restaurants

00:06:10.250 --> 00:06:12.840
and got a lot of
the same answer.

00:06:12.840 --> 00:06:14.530
No experience, no job.

00:06:14.530 --> 00:06:16.840
Finally I had a young chef
who took a chance on me

00:06:16.840 --> 00:06:18.140
and hired me to be a prep cook.

00:06:18.140 --> 00:06:22.610
And I fell in love and within
three months of cooking

00:06:22.610 --> 00:06:28.610
at this diner, I was the head
cook and in an open kitchen,

00:06:28.610 --> 00:06:30.760
getting a chance
to watch people eat

00:06:30.760 --> 00:06:33.086
the food that I was cooking.

00:06:33.086 --> 00:06:35.460
And then they would come up
and say thank you and tell me

00:06:35.460 --> 00:06:36.880
how great it was.

00:06:36.880 --> 00:06:38.652
And I immediately
realized that this

00:06:38.652 --> 00:06:40.610
is what I wanted to do
for the rest of my life.

00:06:40.610 --> 00:06:44.040
And I was 18, and I
feel super lucky that I

00:06:44.040 --> 00:06:46.560
discovered what I wanted to
do for the rest of my life

00:06:46.560 --> 00:06:48.850
so early on.

00:06:48.850 --> 00:06:52.150
And spent the next
dozen or so years

00:06:52.150 --> 00:06:55.520
cooking in various
restaurants, seven of which-- I

00:06:55.520 --> 00:06:57.820
had my own restaurant down
in the Financial District

00:06:57.820 --> 00:07:00.150
not too far from here,
over on Bush and Kearney,

00:07:00.150 --> 00:07:04.130
close to the Chinatown gates,
and I opened that business

00:07:04.130 --> 00:07:06.300
when I was 23.

00:07:06.300 --> 00:07:10.680
And then a few years
later opened up,

00:07:10.680 --> 00:07:14.820
in 1994, San Francisco's first
organic coffee and juice bar.

00:07:14.820 --> 00:07:18.970
It was so far ahead of its
time that it didn't succeed.

00:07:21.480 --> 00:07:24.710
We literally struggled.

00:07:24.710 --> 00:07:27.640
Back then, a 50-pound
box of carrots

00:07:27.640 --> 00:07:29.920
was anywhere between
$70 and $90 a box,

00:07:29.920 --> 00:07:33.020
and now it's about
$25 to $30 a case.

00:07:33.020 --> 00:07:35.090
So you can imagine
the economics.

00:07:35.090 --> 00:07:39.070
And back then, people
were not paying $8 to $10

00:07:39.070 --> 00:07:40.400
for a fresh-pressed juice.

00:07:40.400 --> 00:07:42.410
They were only willing
to pay about $3.

00:07:42.410 --> 00:07:44.760
And so you can do
the math and begin

00:07:44.760 --> 00:07:47.320
to understand the struggles.

00:07:47.320 --> 00:07:49.390
And then Jamba Juice
opened up right

00:07:49.390 --> 00:07:51.670
across the street from us.

00:07:51.670 --> 00:07:54.930
And that pretty much
was the kiss of death.

00:07:54.930 --> 00:07:58.660
My brother and I, with our
heads between our legs,

00:07:58.660 --> 00:08:00.730
sold it and walked away from it.

00:08:00.730 --> 00:08:03.620
It was sad, but it was
an important failure

00:08:03.620 --> 00:08:09.820
because it taught me that we
had to learn how to meet people

00:08:09.820 --> 00:08:13.641
on their own terms, meet them
in some sort of middle ground

00:08:13.641 --> 00:08:16.140
for them to feel comfortable
with what we were offering them

00:08:16.140 --> 00:08:20.550
and not offer something
that was so polarizing,

00:08:20.550 --> 00:08:23.440
that was such a niche market.

00:08:23.440 --> 00:08:27.740
And so when we opened
Bi-Rite in 1998,

00:08:27.740 --> 00:08:32.460
we took that philosophy,
that mentality, and also just

00:08:32.460 --> 00:08:37.280
the mentality and philosophy
of a cook, someone

00:08:37.280 --> 00:08:39.870
who feeds people, and applied
it to a grocery store.

00:08:39.870 --> 00:08:44.070
And when we first opened, not
all our produce was organic.

00:08:44.070 --> 00:08:47.980
I'd say about half-- 40%
might have been organic.

00:08:47.980 --> 00:08:51.400
Of that, maybe a quarter
of it was farm direct.

00:08:51.400 --> 00:08:55.150
We had conventional bananas
and other conventional fruit

00:08:55.150 --> 00:09:01.707
and vegetables, because price
sensitivity was a major issue.

00:09:01.707 --> 00:09:03.290
And we wanted to
make sure that people

00:09:03.290 --> 00:09:06.700
felt like they could access
the food that we were selling.

00:09:06.700 --> 00:09:12.050
And slowly, through education--
I consider myself a feeder,

00:09:12.050 --> 00:09:15.170
but I also consider myself a
teacher-- through this process,

00:09:15.170 --> 00:09:17.220
we evolved.

00:09:17.220 --> 00:09:19.691
And as a business, we
evolved and as a neighborhood

00:09:19.691 --> 00:09:20.940
and as a community we evolved.

00:09:20.940 --> 00:09:23.750
And we've grown together.

00:09:23.750 --> 00:09:26.980
And we started with
a staff of six,

00:09:26.980 --> 00:09:30.550
and now we've got about
315 people working for us

00:09:30.550 --> 00:09:35.400
in the company and have a
tremendous reach and influence

00:09:35.400 --> 00:09:39.320
around the country
with how we operate

00:09:39.320 --> 00:09:42.450
and how we view business.

00:09:42.450 --> 00:09:43.290
Yeah.

00:09:43.290 --> 00:09:46.110
It's been a super cool fun ride.

00:09:46.110 --> 00:09:48.610
JESS: I just want to ask the
audience a few questions first.

00:09:48.610 --> 00:09:51.440
How many of you
identify as home cooks?

00:09:53.990 --> 00:09:54.490
Cool.

00:09:54.490 --> 00:09:57.566
And then how many of you
are familiar with Bi-Rite.

00:09:57.566 --> 00:09:58.950
SAM MOGANNAM: Oh, cool.

00:09:58.950 --> 00:09:59.620
JESS: Awesome.

00:09:59.620 --> 00:10:01.990
SAM MOGANNAM: Fantastic.

00:10:01.990 --> 00:10:04.800
JESS: And how many of you
have taken a cooking class?

00:10:04.800 --> 00:10:07.790
Maybe not necessarily at 18
Reasons but anywhere else,

00:10:07.790 --> 00:10:10.880
and that includes knife
skills or anything like that.

00:10:10.880 --> 00:10:11.500
OK.

00:10:11.500 --> 00:10:14.107
So this is a good room.

00:10:14.107 --> 00:10:15.440
SAM MOGANNAM: The choir is here.

00:10:15.440 --> 00:10:17.731
JESS: How many of you brought
your lunch to work today?

00:10:20.980 --> 00:10:21.990
Uh-huh.

00:10:21.990 --> 00:10:24.655
Uh-huh.

00:10:24.655 --> 00:10:26.030
So I want to pick
up on something

00:10:26.030 --> 00:10:29.120
that you said, and this will
be a question for both of you.

00:10:29.120 --> 00:10:31.270
You said the
philosophy of a cook

00:10:31.270 --> 00:10:34.030
is what you apply to
Bi-Rite, and so I wanted

00:10:34.030 --> 00:10:37.230
to talk a little bit about
of your ultimate mission

00:10:37.230 --> 00:10:39.140
behind Bi-Rite and
what that means,

00:10:39.140 --> 00:10:40.220
the philosophy of a cook.

00:10:40.220 --> 00:10:43.260
And then, similarly, how that
sort of extends to the work

00:10:43.260 --> 00:10:45.770
that you do at 18
Reasons and what's

00:10:45.770 --> 00:10:47.970
really driving that stuff.

00:10:47.970 --> 00:10:50.015
SAM MOGANNAM: They
dovetail pretty seamlessly.

00:10:53.096 --> 00:10:53.690
I don't know.

00:10:53.690 --> 00:10:57.870
I was probably in my early 20s
when I came to the realization

00:10:57.870 --> 00:11:02.450
that as a cook I had this
extraordinary responsibility

00:11:02.450 --> 00:11:04.200
to the person that
I was feeding.

00:11:04.200 --> 00:11:09.970
I got to select the ingredients,
prep them, wash them,

00:11:09.970 --> 00:11:14.230
cut them, and then
cook them and season

00:11:14.230 --> 00:11:16.630
them and taste them
through this process

00:11:16.630 --> 00:11:20.840
and watch them evolve and
then put them on a plate

00:11:20.840 --> 00:11:23.861
and try to make it as pretty and
beautiful as I possibly could

00:11:23.861 --> 00:11:25.360
and then hand that
plate to somebody

00:11:25.360 --> 00:11:26.590
and then watch them
to actually take it

00:11:26.590 --> 00:11:27.923
and put it in their body, right?

00:11:27.923 --> 00:11:29.930
Put it in their
mouth, and then they

00:11:29.930 --> 00:11:34.560
they'd experience the beautiful
acids and salts and sugars

00:11:34.560 --> 00:11:36.590
and bitters and whatever
other flavors were

00:11:36.590 --> 00:11:40.880
going on in this dish,
which was transformative.

00:11:40.880 --> 00:11:43.760
All of us have had these
really magical experiences

00:11:43.760 --> 00:11:47.510
when we eat something that's
super profound and delicious.

00:11:47.510 --> 00:11:49.210
It puts us in a
different place, right?

00:11:49.210 --> 00:11:51.550
It makes us either
feel really great

00:11:51.550 --> 00:11:54.330
or makes us feel
shitty, depending

00:11:54.330 --> 00:11:55.710
on who it is that's feeding us.

00:11:55.710 --> 00:11:58.980
And I definitely wanted
to make people feel great.

00:11:58.980 --> 00:12:01.190
I didn't want to
make them feel sick.

00:12:01.190 --> 00:12:08.060
And so I took that same
sense of mission, that belief

00:12:08.060 --> 00:12:10.110
that it all starts
with great ingredients,

00:12:10.110 --> 00:12:12.990
knowing where those ingredients
come from, making sure

00:12:12.990 --> 00:12:17.760
that they're grown while knowing
where they're being grown,

00:12:17.760 --> 00:12:21.060
who grew them, and kind
of like applied that

00:12:21.060 --> 00:12:24.650
to almost everything that we
sell in the grocery store.

00:12:24.650 --> 00:12:28.420
And as a cook, I was
yearning for a place

00:12:28.420 --> 00:12:32.280
to go shop in San Francisco that
had all the ingredients that I

00:12:32.280 --> 00:12:34.680
was accustomed to
using as a chef.

00:12:34.680 --> 00:12:38.970
And back in '98, that
really didn't exist.

00:12:38.970 --> 00:12:40.670
There weren't very
many stores where

00:12:40.670 --> 00:12:44.395
you can go and have a selection
of a dozen vinegars, where

00:12:44.395 --> 00:12:47.870
you'd be able to go and get Star
Red Wine Vinegar, Star White

00:12:47.870 --> 00:12:50.400
Wine Vinegar, and
Monari Balsamic Vinegar.

00:12:50.400 --> 00:12:52.890
And those were
the three vinegars

00:12:52.890 --> 00:12:54.660
that every supermarket had.

00:12:54.660 --> 00:12:57.900
But to find vinegar from
the Southwest of France,

00:12:57.900 --> 00:13:01.040
from the Banyul grape, or
to find sherry wine vinegar

00:13:01.040 --> 00:13:08.940
or to find beautiful single
varietal grape-based vinegars

00:13:08.940 --> 00:13:10.150
just didn't happen.

00:13:10.150 --> 00:13:12.720
And these are magical
ingredients that

00:13:12.720 --> 00:13:14.000
really can transform a dish.

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:18.050
And so we wanted to
have the ingredients,

00:13:18.050 --> 00:13:22.620
but we also wanted to have
the acumen, because it's

00:13:22.620 --> 00:13:24.560
one thing to sell
those ingredients,

00:13:24.560 --> 00:13:28.160
but you have to be able to
teach people how to use them.

00:13:28.160 --> 00:13:31.670
And so we surrounded
ourselves with a staff

00:13:31.670 --> 00:13:35.930
of folks that love to cook
and worked in restaurants.

00:13:35.930 --> 00:13:38.620
And if they weren't
cooks, they were

00:13:38.620 --> 00:13:42.130
servers who had spent time
working with chefs that

00:13:42.130 --> 00:13:43.624
taught them a lot about food.

00:13:43.624 --> 00:13:45.040
And so we were
teaching people how

00:13:45.040 --> 00:13:46.706
to use the ingredients
at the same time.

00:13:46.706 --> 00:13:50.590
We're empowering people and
helping them elevate the food

00:13:50.590 --> 00:13:52.840
that they were serving,
feeding themselves and feeding

00:13:52.840 --> 00:13:53.465
their families.

00:13:56.150 --> 00:14:03.170
And to me, cooking is one of
those foundational basic skills

00:14:03.170 --> 00:14:07.630
that each of us needs to
embrace and to celebrate,

00:14:07.630 --> 00:14:11.020
because it not only
ensures that you're

00:14:11.020 --> 00:14:13.110
able to feed
yourself really well,

00:14:13.110 --> 00:14:15.860
but it creates this
opportunity to share.

00:14:15.860 --> 00:14:19.440
And it's so wonderful to
be able to feed somebody

00:14:19.440 --> 00:14:22.110
and then to get that
immediate reward from it.

00:14:22.110 --> 00:14:25.060
But it's also really wonderful
to sit around the table

00:14:25.060 --> 00:14:29.290
and to break bread and to talk.

00:14:29.290 --> 00:14:32.160
And that's how
relationships get built.

00:14:32.160 --> 00:14:35.179
And our mission at Bi-Rite
is creating community

00:14:35.179 --> 00:14:35.720
through food.

00:14:35.720 --> 00:14:38.650
And that's about
building relationships,

00:14:38.650 --> 00:14:40.920
deep meaningful relationships,
and I feel really

00:14:40.920 --> 00:14:44.210
strongly that if we're
able to, as a society,

00:14:44.210 --> 00:14:47.630
make stronger bonds, be
more intimately connected,

00:14:47.630 --> 00:14:53.800
then we will achieve change
and become a strong stronger

00:14:53.800 --> 00:14:57.140
community together and really
be supportive and helpful

00:14:57.140 --> 00:14:59.080
to each other.

00:14:59.080 --> 00:15:01.890
And 18 Reasons just
steps right in there

00:15:01.890 --> 00:15:05.900
and actually takes
what we're able to do

00:15:05.900 --> 00:15:09.170
on a very transactional
basis, I would say,

00:15:09.170 --> 00:15:11.590
because our interactions
in the market

00:15:11.590 --> 00:15:15.839
can be anywhere between 2
and 10 minutes, depending.

00:15:15.839 --> 00:15:17.880
And with the classes that
we offer at 18 Reasons,

00:15:17.880 --> 00:15:20.010
and Sarah will talk
more about their impact,

00:15:20.010 --> 00:15:25.120
that we're able to take
control of or ownership

00:15:25.120 --> 00:15:27.180
of that experience
for a period of two

00:15:27.180 --> 00:15:32.040
to three hours, which really
lets us go much deeper.

00:15:32.040 --> 00:15:32.950
SARAH NELSON: Yeah.

00:15:32.950 --> 00:15:36.070
We teach Basic Knife
Skills about twice a month,

00:15:36.070 --> 00:15:37.980
and it's the fastest
class to sell out.

00:15:37.980 --> 00:15:39.530
It's the most in-demand class.

00:15:39.530 --> 00:15:41.680
And our chef said
to me recently,

00:15:41.680 --> 00:15:43.910
I can't believe there's
anyone in San Francisco who

00:15:43.910 --> 00:15:47.240
hasn't taken our Basic Knife
Skills class at this point.

00:15:47.240 --> 00:15:49.510
And people come up to her
at the farmers' market

00:15:49.510 --> 00:15:53.450
and tell her things they
remember from the Basic Knife

00:15:53.450 --> 00:15:54.110
Skills class.

00:15:54.110 --> 00:15:58.320
And it always amazes me too
that this very simple skill is

00:15:58.320 --> 00:16:00.230
lacking in people's lives.

00:16:00.230 --> 00:16:06.190
And to me, cooking is one
tool of self-empowerment

00:16:06.190 --> 00:16:11.070
and taking control over your own
and doing things for yourself.

00:16:11.070 --> 00:16:14.430
And knowing how to use a
knife, it's not that hard.

00:16:14.430 --> 00:16:18.690
We do a lot of things that are
harder, like play "Pokemon Go."

00:16:18.690 --> 00:16:20.820
I don't have a clue
how to do that.

00:16:20.820 --> 00:16:24.100
But using a knife, people come
into our knife skills class,

00:16:24.100 --> 00:16:25.760
and they're so
scared, and they're

00:16:25.760 --> 00:16:28.304
so nervous and just
watching them pick up

00:16:28.304 --> 00:16:30.220
the knife for the first
time, and they're just

00:16:30.220 --> 00:16:31.629
so worried about it.

00:16:31.629 --> 00:16:33.920
And by the end of the class,
like they're just relaxed,

00:16:33.920 --> 00:16:35.800
they're so happy they've
mastered the skill.

00:16:35.800 --> 00:16:38.050
And that's all you really
need to go and cook anything

00:16:38.050 --> 00:16:39.174
that you want for yourself.

00:16:39.174 --> 00:16:42.199
And so even in our paid classes
or in our free classes where

00:16:42.199 --> 00:16:43.740
we get a lot of
folks who don't cook,

00:16:43.740 --> 00:16:45.500
they've never cooked
before, they have never

00:16:45.500 --> 00:16:47.083
used some of the
vegetables that we're

00:16:47.083 --> 00:16:49.710
using, they're intimidated
by trying new things,

00:16:49.710 --> 00:16:52.470
trying new skills, by the end
of that class, they're so happy.

00:16:52.470 --> 00:16:54.960
They've mastered this
wonderful new skill.

00:16:54.960 --> 00:16:57.770
And I think cooking, along with
a lot of other home-ec skills,

00:16:57.770 --> 00:16:59.650
have been completely lost.

00:16:59.650 --> 00:17:04.690
How many people are still sewing
their own buttons on and fixing

00:17:04.690 --> 00:17:07.550
their cars and building
things in their woodshops

00:17:07.550 --> 00:17:08.450
in their garage?

00:17:08.450 --> 00:17:11.619
And things that used to be
taught in school that are not

00:17:11.619 --> 00:17:16.165
taught in school anymore because
the corporations that control

00:17:16.165 --> 00:17:18.789
us don't want us to know how to
do things for ourselves, right?

00:17:18.789 --> 00:17:20.680
No, seriously.

00:17:20.680 --> 00:17:23.930
Who used their body
to get to work today?

00:17:23.930 --> 00:17:26.290
Who walked or rode a bike?

00:17:26.290 --> 00:17:27.130
Good job.

00:17:27.130 --> 00:17:28.760
You did something for yourself.

00:17:28.760 --> 00:17:31.940
You took that power,
and you did it yourself.

00:17:31.940 --> 00:17:33.820
Who cleans their own house?

00:17:33.820 --> 00:17:34.450
Awesome.

00:17:34.450 --> 00:17:35.670
You guys are awesome.

00:17:35.670 --> 00:17:37.219
You take care of your own shit.

00:17:37.219 --> 00:17:37.760
That's great.

00:17:37.760 --> 00:17:39.180
I love it.

00:17:39.180 --> 00:17:41.000
We're just encouraged
all the time

00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:43.290
by corporations
trying to make money

00:17:43.290 --> 00:17:45.650
that we shouldn't do any of
these things for ourselves.

00:17:45.650 --> 00:17:48.175
We should take an Uber,
like why would you walk?

00:17:48.175 --> 00:17:49.383
Why would you ride your bike?

00:17:49.383 --> 00:17:50.470
It's so easy.

00:17:50.470 --> 00:17:53.041
You shouldn't clean your own
clothes or do your own laundry

00:17:53.041 --> 00:17:54.040
or clean your own house.

00:17:54.040 --> 00:17:55.240
You shouldn't cook
your own food.

00:17:55.240 --> 00:17:56.530
Why would you want to
cook your own food?

00:17:56.530 --> 00:17:58.380
Like there's all this
just great food out there.

00:17:58.380 --> 00:17:59.463
Just eat what we give you.

00:17:59.463 --> 00:18:03.262
And a lot of it, yes, things
have made our lives easier.

00:18:03.262 --> 00:18:04.720
Have you guys read
Michael Pollan's

00:18:04.720 --> 00:18:06.320
"Cooked," his last book?

00:18:06.320 --> 00:18:09.080
He points out that when all
these labor-saving devices were

00:18:09.080 --> 00:18:10.524
coming around in
the '50s, cooking

00:18:10.524 --> 00:18:12.690
was the one chore that
housewives said they actually

00:18:12.690 --> 00:18:15.040
enjoyed, and they didn't want
it to be taken away from them.

00:18:15.040 --> 00:18:16.456
And the reason
that you still have

00:18:16.456 --> 00:18:19.020
to add an egg to a cake mix
is because that gives you

00:18:19.020 --> 00:18:20.417
the illusion that
you're cooking.

00:18:20.417 --> 00:18:22.750
They could have powdered the
egg and thrown it in there,

00:18:22.750 --> 00:18:24.083
but people wouldn't go for that.

00:18:24.083 --> 00:18:26.936
People still want
to cook in some way.

00:18:26.936 --> 00:18:28.060
And so you add that egg in.

00:18:28.060 --> 00:18:30.442
You feel like you're actually
making that cake yourself.

00:18:30.442 --> 00:18:31.900
And so I feel like
people do really

00:18:31.900 --> 00:18:34.870
want to use their
brains and their bodies

00:18:34.870 --> 00:18:36.172
to take care of themselves.

00:18:36.172 --> 00:18:37.630
But it's getting
harder and harder.

00:18:37.630 --> 00:18:39.350
We're encouraged not to do it.

00:18:39.350 --> 00:18:41.590
And cooking for
yourself really brings

00:18:41.590 --> 00:18:43.100
that sense of empowerment.

00:18:43.100 --> 00:18:45.140
And then also, as
Sam was touching on,

00:18:45.140 --> 00:18:47.680
connection to the people
who made that food

00:18:47.680 --> 00:18:50.677
and to your family as well.

00:18:50.677 --> 00:18:52.260
I'm serious about
bringing your lunch.

00:18:52.260 --> 00:18:54.220
I bring my own lunch
to work every day,

00:18:54.220 --> 00:18:56.550
and it's usually leftovers
of what me and my boyfriend

00:18:56.550 --> 00:18:57.630
made last night.

00:18:57.630 --> 00:18:59.370
And for me, it's like
a point in the day

00:18:59.370 --> 00:19:02.110
when I think about my
boyfriend and the dinner

00:19:02.110 --> 00:19:04.040
we had last night and
my connection with him,

00:19:04.040 --> 00:19:05.690
and sometimes we text
each other, like,

00:19:05.690 --> 00:19:08.106
thanks for the great lunch,
whichever one of us cooked it.

00:19:08.106 --> 00:19:09.940
And it gives me that connection.

00:19:09.940 --> 00:19:11.440
I know exactly what
that food means,

00:19:11.440 --> 00:19:13.110
and it's our food,
even if it's not

00:19:13.110 --> 00:19:16.970
as good as the amazing lunch
I just had in your cafe.

00:19:16.970 --> 00:19:19.686
We made risotto last night
and had some risotto,

00:19:19.686 --> 00:19:21.310
and I had a raw
pepper, so I cut it up,

00:19:21.310 --> 00:19:24.210
and I had this lunch that was
like risotto and a raw pepper.

00:19:24.210 --> 00:19:25.279
Like who cares?

00:19:25.279 --> 00:19:27.070
But it was a risotto
that we made together,

00:19:27.070 --> 00:19:29.080
and peppers are good
for you, so whatever.

00:19:29.080 --> 00:19:31.934
And it just makes me think
about my family and my home,

00:19:31.934 --> 00:19:34.350
and it makes me happy to do
that and have that connection.

00:19:34.350 --> 00:19:37.700
And the food that's here,
it's amazing and wonderful and

00:19:37.700 --> 00:19:38.740
futuristic.

00:19:38.740 --> 00:19:40.700
My best friend is the
Food Director for Sprig,

00:19:40.700 --> 00:19:42.720
and she came to dinner at my
house, and we ordered Sprig.

00:19:42.720 --> 00:19:44.690
And it arrived, and this
food was in front of us

00:19:44.690 --> 00:19:45.600
just like the food
you guys have here,

00:19:45.600 --> 00:19:47.260
very healthy, local, seasonal.

00:19:47.260 --> 00:19:48.390
I'm like this is weird.

00:19:48.390 --> 00:19:49.230
I'm in the future.

00:19:49.230 --> 00:19:51.990
Food just showed up, and
it's delicious and healthy.

00:19:51.990 --> 00:19:54.070
But who, where, what is this?

00:19:54.070 --> 00:19:55.880
Like what connection is there?

00:19:55.880 --> 00:19:56.740
Who grew this food?

00:19:56.740 --> 00:19:57.600
Who made this food?

00:19:57.600 --> 00:19:59.230
I had nothing to
do with this food.

00:19:59.230 --> 00:20:02.200
And having that experience
of cooking yourself,

00:20:02.200 --> 00:20:03.742
cooking with your
friends and family,

00:20:03.742 --> 00:20:06.033
even if it's not that great,
just make a grilled cheese

00:20:06.033 --> 00:20:08.280
sandwich, and you can feel
really proud of yourself

00:20:08.280 --> 00:20:11.970
for doing that and feel
a moment of humanity

00:20:11.970 --> 00:20:16.061
that the man is trying to take
away from us all the time.

00:20:16.061 --> 00:20:16.560
Seriously.

00:20:16.560 --> 00:20:19.044
I kind of an anarchist.

00:20:19.044 --> 00:20:20.037
SAM MOGANNAM: Really?

00:20:20.037 --> 00:20:21.370
SARAH NELSON: Just a little bit.

00:20:21.370 --> 00:20:23.530
Just a little bit.

00:20:23.530 --> 00:20:25.720
I do think it's wonderful
that Google provides you

00:20:25.720 --> 00:20:28.685
such good food, because I
think a lot of young people

00:20:28.685 --> 00:20:30.060
are working in
the tech industry,

00:20:30.060 --> 00:20:32.130
and I've seen it,
people who are my age

00:20:32.130 --> 00:20:33.630
and starting to
have kids and not

00:20:33.630 --> 00:20:35.260
eat dinner at work every day.

00:20:35.260 --> 00:20:37.670
They're taking that food
they're used to-- you

00:20:37.670 --> 00:20:39.850
guys are used to really
high-quality food-- that's

00:20:39.850 --> 00:20:41.690
what you're going to
cook for your families.

00:20:41.690 --> 00:20:44.260
So when this tech generation
grows up a little bit

00:20:44.260 --> 00:20:47.426
and stops being at work 24
hours a day, and I've seen it,

00:20:47.426 --> 00:20:48.300
like friends of mine.

00:20:48.300 --> 00:20:49.800
A friend of mine
who works at Apple,

00:20:49.800 --> 00:20:51.430
he used to use his
kitchen as storage.

00:20:51.430 --> 00:20:53.090
He said, well, it's not worth
my time to learn how to cook,

00:20:53.090 --> 00:20:55.350
because I make more money
working instead of cooking.

00:20:55.350 --> 00:20:57.460
And now he as a kid
and he's like Instagram

00:20:57.460 --> 00:20:59.410
every single thing
that he makes.

00:20:59.410 --> 00:21:01.280
Seriously, same person.

00:21:01.280 --> 00:21:05.745
And he's 40, so when this
young generation is coming up,

00:21:05.745 --> 00:21:09.190
I do think that having that
wonderful access to great food

00:21:09.190 --> 00:21:11.380
at work will influence the
choices that you guys are

00:21:11.380 --> 00:21:11.880
making.

00:21:11.880 --> 00:21:14.420
But I would encourage you
to start that process now.

00:21:14.420 --> 00:21:15.160
Come on out.

00:21:15.160 --> 00:21:16.170
Come on out of Google.

00:21:16.170 --> 00:21:18.790
Like, yeah, there's classes
here and there's stuff here,

00:21:18.790 --> 00:21:20.540
but come on out into
the city, because you

00:21:20.540 --> 00:21:22.910
can have different experiences
and come meet new people

00:21:22.910 --> 00:21:25.860
and learn new things and
discover things you never

00:21:25.860 --> 00:21:27.490
would have expected.

00:21:27.490 --> 00:21:29.240
SAM MOGANNAM: That's
so totally funny,

00:21:29.240 --> 00:21:32.650
because I was in New York
about a week and a half ago,

00:21:32.650 --> 00:21:34.550
and there's this
whole campaign--

00:21:34.550 --> 00:21:37.410
has anyone here used Seamless?

00:21:37.410 --> 00:21:40.080
It's another meal delivery
service that's out there.

00:21:40.080 --> 00:21:45.250
And the subways were riddled
with these ads, and one of them

00:21:45.250 --> 00:21:47.920
was just so poignant to
what you were saying, Sarah.

00:21:47.920 --> 00:21:52.850
It said avoid cooking like
you avoid Times Square.

00:21:52.850 --> 00:21:55.670
Anybody who lives in New York
will not go to Times Square.

00:21:55.670 --> 00:21:58.810
It's like the one part of
the city that you just avoid.

00:21:58.810 --> 00:22:01.810
And I couldn't believe that
they used that as the analogy

00:22:01.810 --> 00:22:03.680
for buying Seamless.

00:22:03.680 --> 00:22:05.670
But they're
subliminally telling us

00:22:05.670 --> 00:22:08.140
that cooking actually
is a bad chore,

00:22:08.140 --> 00:22:09.336
that it's a waste of time.

00:22:09.336 --> 00:22:11.210
SARAH NELSON: The ones
I hate are TaskRabbit.

00:22:11.210 --> 00:22:12.501
You see them all over the city.

00:22:12.501 --> 00:22:13.690
We do chores.

00:22:13.690 --> 00:22:14.920
You live life.

00:22:14.920 --> 00:22:17.230
I'm like, life is
not doing chores?

00:22:17.230 --> 00:22:19.010
Like chores are
pro-life, people.

00:22:19.010 --> 00:22:20.760
Yeah, sometimes you
have to hang shelves--

00:22:20.760 --> 00:22:21.750
SAM MOGANNAM: Do your laundry.

00:22:21.750 --> 00:22:23.290
SARAH NELSON: --and why
not get your friends

00:22:23.290 --> 00:22:25.260
to come over and hang
your shelves with you?

00:22:25.260 --> 00:22:27.890
It's not all about
drinking in Dolores Park.

00:22:27.890 --> 00:22:29.180
You know what I'm saying?

00:22:29.180 --> 00:22:30.180
Seriously.

00:22:30.180 --> 00:22:31.430
Learn to do things yourselves.

00:22:31.430 --> 00:22:32.127
We do chores.

00:22:32.127 --> 00:22:32.710
You live life.

00:22:32.710 --> 00:22:34.750
Oh, my god.

00:22:34.750 --> 00:22:35.590
Anyway.

00:22:35.590 --> 00:22:36.540
JESS: Although, to
be fair, I'm sure

00:22:36.540 --> 00:22:38.310
a lot of people
drinking in Dolores Park

00:22:38.310 --> 00:22:39.600
swing by Bi-Rite first.

00:22:39.600 --> 00:22:40.516
SAM MOGANNAM: Totally.

00:22:40.516 --> 00:22:42.390
SARAH NELSON: That
is definitely true.

00:22:42.390 --> 00:22:46.610
JESS: So I wanted to also ask,
I think one of the other things,

00:22:46.610 --> 00:22:48.770
you talked about cooking
as self-empowerment

00:22:48.770 --> 00:22:52.037
and sort of the tech
generation growing up.

00:22:52.037 --> 00:22:53.620
The other thing that
I've always found

00:22:53.620 --> 00:22:55.879
is cooking and
learning about cooking

00:22:55.879 --> 00:22:57.670
and learning new kinds
of food and learning

00:22:57.670 --> 00:23:01.600
new kinds of ingredients
is sort of an extension

00:23:01.600 --> 00:23:03.270
of my intellectual curiosity.

00:23:03.270 --> 00:23:05.790
I consider it to be fun and
interesting and learning

00:23:05.790 --> 00:23:08.360
the way that it's fun
and interesting to learn

00:23:08.360 --> 00:23:09.290
about anything else.

00:23:09.290 --> 00:23:13.840
And so to the extent that you
have either seen people really

00:23:13.840 --> 00:23:16.940
have those kind of awakenings
when they're shopping

00:23:16.940 --> 00:23:18.610
or when they're
in the class, I'd

00:23:18.610 --> 00:23:20.910
love to hear your
thoughts on that

00:23:20.910 --> 00:23:23.129
and if that's been
effective for you.

00:23:23.129 --> 00:23:23.920
SAM MOGANNAM: Yeah.

00:23:23.920 --> 00:23:28.390
I agree that it is.

00:23:28.390 --> 00:23:31.180
There couldn't be a
more perfect balance

00:23:31.180 --> 00:23:35.050
of science and
technology in that sense

00:23:35.050 --> 00:23:39.340
that you've got to
follow a recipe.

00:23:39.340 --> 00:23:42.840
And there are measurements
and ingredients.

00:23:42.840 --> 00:23:48.090
There's a whole
scientific aspect to it,

00:23:48.090 --> 00:23:51.180
but then there's this
really amazing creative side

00:23:51.180 --> 00:23:53.890
and the spontaneous side.

00:23:53.890 --> 00:23:57.210
And then there's
this whole-- and it's

00:23:57.210 --> 00:23:59.872
not innate for all of us,
but like instinctual side

00:23:59.872 --> 00:24:01.330
that after you've
done it, then you

00:24:01.330 --> 00:24:05.040
can begin to add your
own flair and adapt

00:24:05.040 --> 00:24:12.769
and really be super creative
and fun with the ingredients

00:24:12.769 --> 00:24:14.560
that you select and
the adaptation that you

00:24:14.560 --> 00:24:15.770
do with particular recipes.

00:24:18.450 --> 00:24:20.610
Any time I have ever
cooked with anybody

00:24:20.610 --> 00:24:23.600
and gone through the process
and handed them the knife

00:24:23.600 --> 00:24:25.100
and shown them how
to hold the knife

00:24:25.100 --> 00:24:28.140
and then had them walk through
the sauteing or roasting

00:24:28.140 --> 00:24:32.450
process, they're stimulating
parts of their brain

00:24:32.450 --> 00:24:35.290
that they haven't exercised.

00:24:35.290 --> 00:24:39.210
And those endorphins that
come from that process

00:24:39.210 --> 00:24:43.590
are extremely energizing
and uplifting.

00:24:43.590 --> 00:24:46.620
And, inevitably, I've
never actually seen

00:24:46.620 --> 00:24:49.450
it not bring a smile to
somebody's face and the sense

00:24:49.450 --> 00:24:55.550
of fulfillment that comes from
the process of transforming

00:24:55.550 --> 00:24:58.910
a whole head of cauliflower into
a beautiful roasted cauliflower

00:24:58.910 --> 00:25:00.980
that we ate today for lunch.

00:25:00.980 --> 00:25:02.430
And that's part
of what worries me

00:25:02.430 --> 00:25:05.370
about things like Sprig and
these other meal kit companies,

00:25:05.370 --> 00:25:07.990
is we're going to
eventually get to this place

00:25:07.990 --> 00:25:10.440
where people aren't
even going to know

00:25:10.440 --> 00:25:14.279
what a whole head of
cauliflower looks like.

00:25:14.279 --> 00:25:16.320
There was this whole thing
that was done on kids,

00:25:16.320 --> 00:25:23.400
and they asked them to
draw where beef comes from,

00:25:23.400 --> 00:25:26.250
and they drew pictures of
steak, because they had no idea

00:25:26.250 --> 00:25:28.900
that steak came from cows.

00:25:28.900 --> 00:25:33.530
And I have seen it
in our own store.

00:25:33.530 --> 00:25:36.705
We often will have little
groups of kids come in,

00:25:36.705 --> 00:25:38.350
and one of the first
things that I do

00:25:38.350 --> 00:25:40.540
is take them to the produce
counter and just kind of

00:25:40.540 --> 00:25:43.040
get a sense of whether they
know what their veggies are.

00:25:43.040 --> 00:25:44.540
And I'll point to
particular veggies

00:25:44.540 --> 00:25:46.740
and ask them to
just tell me what

00:25:46.740 --> 00:25:49.940
they are, things like
cauliflower and broccoli

00:25:49.940 --> 00:25:52.990
and eggplant, celery.

00:25:52.990 --> 00:25:55.030
They have no idea what it is.

00:25:55.030 --> 00:25:56.530
And then when you
tell them, they're

00:25:56.530 --> 00:25:58.613
like, oh, I didn't know
that that's what that was.

00:25:58.613 --> 00:26:00.060
I had never heard of that.

00:26:00.060 --> 00:26:01.850
These are like 8
to 10-year-olds,

00:26:01.850 --> 00:26:03.360
and it's kind of scary.

00:26:03.360 --> 00:26:07.100
And if we continue to
rely on diced up precut,

00:26:07.100 --> 00:26:12.610
prewashed everything, then
that connection to what I feel

00:26:12.610 --> 00:26:15.300
is like a foundation
to who we are as people

00:26:15.300 --> 00:26:18.980
and what has actually been
the foundation of what created

00:26:18.980 --> 00:26:21.710
society, if it wasn't
for modern agriculture,

00:26:21.710 --> 00:26:24.720
we would still be running
around with spears

00:26:24.720 --> 00:26:27.250
chasing after animals.

00:26:27.250 --> 00:26:31.580
That's really what created
the first communities was

00:26:31.580 --> 00:26:33.175
the agricultural
communities that

00:26:33.175 --> 00:26:36.590
were created in Mesopotamia.

00:26:36.590 --> 00:26:39.540
Food's critical for
us, and we need it,

00:26:39.540 --> 00:26:41.740
and we need to be empowered
with that knowledge

00:26:41.740 --> 00:26:44.475
and that information to be
able to do it for ourselves.

00:26:48.090 --> 00:26:50.380
JESS: Amen.

00:26:50.380 --> 00:26:52.170
SARAH NELSON: I
think one thing that

00:26:52.170 --> 00:26:54.880
makes 18 Reasons kind of unique
among other cooking schools

00:26:54.880 --> 00:26:57.310
is that the person teaching
our Indian cooking class

00:26:57.310 --> 00:27:00.460
is from India, and the person
teaching our Italian class

00:27:00.460 --> 00:27:01.580
is from Italy.

00:27:01.580 --> 00:27:04.750
And they are mostly not
trained chefs, unfortunately,

00:27:04.750 --> 00:27:06.570
for our beloved
volunteers who have

00:27:06.570 --> 00:27:08.770
to wash dishes behind them.

00:27:08.770 --> 00:27:11.224
Chefs are amazing
humans who really

00:27:11.224 --> 00:27:13.890
know how to get things done in a
clean and wonderfully organized

00:27:13.890 --> 00:27:17.895
way, and home cooks are amazing,
but they're super messy.

00:27:17.895 --> 00:27:20.280
And we have these
really passionate home

00:27:20.280 --> 00:27:24.420
cooks who come to us and
say, look, I'm from wherever.

00:27:24.420 --> 00:27:27.390
I'm from Iran, and I really want
to do this traditional-- I want

00:27:27.390 --> 00:27:28.845
to teach a class
on Northern Iran,

00:27:28.845 --> 00:27:30.470
but then I want to
do a different class

00:27:30.470 --> 00:27:31.700
on Western Iran.

00:27:31.700 --> 00:27:32.970
I'm like, great.

00:27:32.970 --> 00:27:35.730
Who knew Northern and Western
Iran are so different?

00:27:35.730 --> 00:27:38.890
And those are the kind of
teachers who come to us.

00:27:38.890 --> 00:27:41.450
They mostly find us, and
then we have these classes

00:27:41.450 --> 00:27:45.350
where you really delve into
a culture and the ingredients

00:27:45.350 --> 00:27:49.370
and that kind of 360-degree
experience of a completely

00:27:49.370 --> 00:27:53.140
different place but with that
same love for home cooking.

00:27:53.140 --> 00:27:57.740
And a lot of the recipes in our
classes you can't get anywhere.

00:27:57.740 --> 00:28:00.057
If you come to our
Vietnamese class,

00:28:00.057 --> 00:28:01.640
you won't be making
anything you could

00:28:01.640 --> 00:28:03.380
get at a Vietnamese restaurant.

00:28:03.380 --> 00:28:05.210
You'll be getting
things that are served

00:28:05.210 --> 00:28:07.340
on the street in Vietnam.

00:28:07.340 --> 00:28:09.180
Our Vietnamese teacher
is from the island

00:28:09.180 --> 00:28:10.450
that fish sauce comes from.

00:28:10.450 --> 00:28:12.520
So he's a big fish sauce
guy and will teach you

00:28:12.520 --> 00:28:14.520
all these different things
to do with fish sauce

00:28:14.520 --> 00:28:16.144
and how it's made
and all these things.

00:28:16.144 --> 00:28:17.960
So our teachers
are really, really

00:28:17.960 --> 00:28:21.790
invested in a deep way
in getting people excited

00:28:21.790 --> 00:28:24.840
about, not only the food,
but the culture behind it

00:28:24.840 --> 00:28:28.130
and the incredible richness
in every single country

00:28:28.130 --> 00:28:30.306
and every single region
and every country.

00:28:30.306 --> 00:28:32.415
Our Italian teacher does
12 classes in a year

00:28:32.415 --> 00:28:33.790
from 12 different
parts of Italy,

00:28:33.790 --> 00:28:35.331
and they're all
completely different.

00:28:35.331 --> 00:28:37.180
There's this amazing
diversity that's

00:28:37.180 --> 00:28:40.481
still out there in the
world, even though we're all

00:28:40.481 --> 00:28:42.730
eating hamburgers and fries
here in America every day.

00:28:42.730 --> 00:28:45.690
There are these
wonderful riches of food

00:28:45.690 --> 00:28:48.550
in culture and ingredients
that's out there.

00:28:48.550 --> 00:28:51.170
Our chef actually has
a book coming out today

00:28:51.170 --> 00:28:52.440
called "Dandelion and Quince."

00:28:52.440 --> 00:28:54.880
It's about 36 unusual
fruits, vegetables,

00:28:54.880 --> 00:28:57.892
and herbs that you may not have
heard of and may not be using.

00:28:57.892 --> 00:29:00.350
And it's all wonderful that
we're eating a lot of kale now,

00:29:00.350 --> 00:29:02.190
but there's a lot
more than kale that's

00:29:02.190 --> 00:29:04.600
out there in the
vegetable world, right?

00:29:04.600 --> 00:29:06.870
Let's eat celeriac.

00:29:06.870 --> 00:29:08.380
Let's eat stinging nettles.

00:29:08.380 --> 00:29:10.100
Let's eat all these
other weird things

00:29:10.100 --> 00:29:13.234
that are amazing and delicious
and really good for you

00:29:13.234 --> 00:29:14.900
and have these different
health benefits

00:29:14.900 --> 00:29:18.574
and uses and cultural references
from around the world.

00:29:18.574 --> 00:29:20.240
So it's something
that we do that's kind

00:29:20.240 --> 00:29:22.860
of beyond-- the skills is
like really giving people

00:29:22.860 --> 00:29:25.270
that cultural experience
and putting them

00:29:25.270 --> 00:29:27.510
in touch with other
home cooks like them

00:29:27.510 --> 00:29:29.380
from around the world.

00:29:29.380 --> 00:29:31.410
AUDIENCE: I was curious
to hear about how

00:29:31.410 --> 00:29:35.486
Bi-Rite has potentially evolved
as San Francisco has evolved.

00:29:35.486 --> 00:29:37.110
You were referencing
earlier that there

00:29:37.110 --> 00:29:40.900
are so many of these newfangled
things-- Uber, TaskRabbit--

00:29:40.900 --> 00:29:42.900
and we're like in this
hotbed of the city that's

00:29:42.900 --> 00:29:44.119
really on the edge.

00:29:44.119 --> 00:29:45.660
And I was curious
for a business that

00:29:45.660 --> 00:29:47.470
has existed for so
long, what is that

00:29:47.470 --> 00:29:50.680
like responding to a place
that's changing so rapidly?

00:29:50.680 --> 00:29:53.110
SAM MOGANNAM: Yeah,
it's interesting.

00:29:53.110 --> 00:29:56.520
I feel like the change that's
happened in the last two years

00:29:56.520 --> 00:30:00.690
has been exponentially
faster than the change

00:30:00.690 --> 00:30:04.750
that we've experienced the last
16 years under my ownership.

00:30:04.750 --> 00:30:07.630
And we're still trying
to understand it.

00:30:07.630 --> 00:30:09.700
When we were talking
about this over lunch,

00:30:09.700 --> 00:30:15.220
part of the change that's
really significant to us

00:30:15.220 --> 00:30:20.790
is that there's been a shift
in who lives in San Francisco.

00:30:20.790 --> 00:30:24.160
And we spent years cultivating
these relationships.

00:30:24.160 --> 00:30:25.680
It's what we do.

00:30:25.680 --> 00:30:28.505
We sell food, but really
it's relationship building

00:30:28.505 --> 00:30:30.630
that we do, whether it's
with the people that we're

00:30:30.630 --> 00:30:33.360
selling the food to or the
people we're buying it from

00:30:33.360 --> 00:30:35.870
or the staff that we employ.

00:30:35.870 --> 00:30:41.040
And because of the economic
challenges that many people

00:30:41.040 --> 00:30:43.520
have faced, they've
either been displaced

00:30:43.520 --> 00:30:45.400
and have had to
leave the Bay Area,

00:30:45.400 --> 00:30:49.740
oftentimes leave the
state, or they cashed out

00:30:49.740 --> 00:30:54.320
because it was just too
lucrative that they were like,

00:30:54.320 --> 00:30:56.600
I can do better somewhere else.

00:30:56.600 --> 00:30:58.550
And so now we're
trying to get to know

00:30:58.550 --> 00:31:02.650
a whole new
demographic, and I feel

00:31:02.650 --> 00:31:04.960
like we're back in
startup mode again,

00:31:04.960 --> 00:31:10.170
yet in a slightly different way
where, when we started in '98

00:31:10.170 --> 00:31:16.861
and going through the crash
that happened-- the dot com

00:31:16.861 --> 00:31:19.360
bust that happened-- and then
the second crash that happened

00:31:19.360 --> 00:31:25.390
in 2009, we had just a
deep-rooted community of people

00:31:25.390 --> 00:31:26.470
that were loyal.

00:31:26.470 --> 00:31:28.670
Now we're finding that
we're having to actually

00:31:28.670 --> 00:31:32.830
start all over again with
a bunch of other markets

00:31:32.830 --> 00:31:35.850
and services that
are out there that

00:31:35.850 --> 00:31:40.720
are taking kind of like what
we've done and iterating on it

00:31:40.720 --> 00:31:46.589
and offering local, organic,
sustainable everything.

00:31:46.589 --> 00:31:49.130
AUDIENCE: Sam, could you talk
a little bit about the decision

00:31:49.130 --> 00:31:51.560
and discussion around
opening the second location

00:31:51.560 --> 00:31:55.610
on Divisadero and whether you
are planning further growth.

00:31:55.610 --> 00:31:57.332
At what point does
that make sense?

00:31:57.332 --> 00:31:58.790
SAM MOGANNAM: Yeah,
great question.

00:31:58.790 --> 00:32:02.870
The second market,
to be honest, was

00:32:02.870 --> 00:32:06.550
driven by a need
within the organization

00:32:06.550 --> 00:32:08.770
to create space
for people to grow.

00:32:08.770 --> 00:32:13.250
We were about 12-- let me think.

00:32:13.250 --> 00:32:16.730
It was like 13 years
in when we actually

00:32:16.730 --> 00:32:21.540
embarked on the search for
a new spot to do a market.

00:32:21.540 --> 00:32:24.849
And at the time, we had
several staff members

00:32:24.849 --> 00:32:26.390
who had been with
us for a long time.

00:32:29.230 --> 00:32:31.300
They wanted to grow,
like all of us.

00:32:31.300 --> 00:32:33.950
And we need to
constantly be challenged

00:32:33.950 --> 00:32:37.390
and to feel like that we're
taking the experiences

00:32:37.390 --> 00:32:40.190
that we're building
and building on them

00:32:40.190 --> 00:32:41.810
and doing more
and better things.

00:32:41.810 --> 00:32:45.270
And there were definitely
a few key people

00:32:45.270 --> 00:32:48.270
that if we didn't open
the second market,

00:32:48.270 --> 00:32:50.939
we probably would have lost.

00:32:50.939 --> 00:32:52.480
And so we started
the process, and we

00:32:52.480 --> 00:32:54.570
knew that we wanted to
be in a neighborhood

00:32:54.570 --> 00:32:57.640
where like-minded people
were going to be there.

00:32:57.640 --> 00:33:03.840
And Nopa, the restaurant, is
owned by two dear friends.

00:33:03.840 --> 00:33:07.384
Lawrence, who's the chef,
and I have known each other

00:33:07.384 --> 00:33:09.050
since the days when
I had my restaurant,

00:33:09.050 --> 00:33:11.330
so back in 1993 we met.

00:33:11.330 --> 00:33:13.632
And then Jeff Hanak,
who's his partner,

00:33:13.632 --> 00:33:15.090
and I went to high
school together.

00:33:15.090 --> 00:33:17.047
So I've known him
since I was 14,

00:33:17.047 --> 00:33:18.630
and we're both native
San Franciscans.

00:33:18.630 --> 00:33:23.000
And so that was a logical
spot for us to move into.

00:33:23.000 --> 00:33:25.180
And that building had heritage.

00:33:25.180 --> 00:33:30.320
It was an original Safeway back
in the late '20s, back when

00:33:30.320 --> 00:33:32.360
supermarkets didn't
have to be 50,000

00:33:32.360 --> 00:33:35.020
square feet with
four-acre parking lots

00:33:35.020 --> 00:33:36.600
and take up all this space.

00:33:36.600 --> 00:33:40.560
Every neighborhood
had it's Bi-Rite

00:33:40.560 --> 00:33:42.080
or it's mini little Safeway.

00:33:42.080 --> 00:33:43.640
And people would walk.

00:33:43.640 --> 00:33:49.780
They would use their bodies,
and they would shop and see

00:33:49.780 --> 00:33:54.310
each other in the grocery store,
get to know their butcher, Sam,

00:33:54.310 --> 00:33:58.560
and then walk and carry
their own groceries home

00:33:58.560 --> 00:34:00.170
and then cook.

00:34:00.170 --> 00:34:03.440
And so it was a
neighborhood that

00:34:03.440 --> 00:34:08.400
also had been asking for us.

00:34:08.400 --> 00:34:11.469
There were several neighborhoods
that wanted us to move,

00:34:11.469 --> 00:34:13.070
and that was one.

00:34:13.070 --> 00:34:17.360
And then with regards to
future growth, while we're

00:34:17.360 --> 00:34:25.315
in the process of building out
the Divisadero store, about 8,

00:34:25.315 --> 00:34:28.020
10 months in,
conversations internally

00:34:28.020 --> 00:34:31.139
started to happen around who
we're going to move over there,

00:34:31.139 --> 00:34:35.120
trying to start to build
the outline of a team--

00:34:35.120 --> 00:34:36.429
the leadership team.

00:34:36.429 --> 00:34:38.658
And I had several
staff members asking me

00:34:38.658 --> 00:34:40.949
about whether there was an
opportunity for them to move

00:34:40.949 --> 00:34:43.929
over there and even more
staff members asking me

00:34:43.929 --> 00:34:45.850
what the future of
Bi-Rite looked like.

00:34:45.850 --> 00:34:46.710
They wanted to know
if we were going

00:34:46.710 --> 00:34:48.168
to be the next
Whole Foods or if we

00:34:48.168 --> 00:34:51.110
were going to continue to
expand in San Francisco

00:34:51.110 --> 00:34:54.460
or if we were looking
out of the Bay Area.

00:34:54.460 --> 00:34:59.780
And I didn't have an answer
that was totally codified

00:34:59.780 --> 00:35:03.240
and that wasn't one
that all of us shared.

00:35:03.240 --> 00:35:06.380
And so we embarked
on the process

00:35:06.380 --> 00:35:08.180
of writing a 10-year vision.

00:35:08.180 --> 00:35:11.020
And it took us a
year and a half.

00:35:11.020 --> 00:35:14.690
It usually takes a
long time to write

00:35:14.690 --> 00:35:16.710
our missions and our
visions, because we really

00:35:16.710 --> 00:35:19.640
want to have space in
between particular sessions

00:35:19.640 --> 00:35:22.430
so there's opportunity
for reflection,

00:35:22.430 --> 00:35:24.840
and we also are very
Socratic and try

00:35:24.840 --> 00:35:27.115
to involve as many people
as we possibly can.

00:35:27.115 --> 00:35:28.740
And the vision writing
process actually

00:35:28.740 --> 00:35:32.500
involved all 250 people who were
working in the organization.

00:35:32.500 --> 00:35:35.020
And at each point when
we had the drafts,

00:35:35.020 --> 00:35:37.620
we were delivering the drafts
in both English and in Spanish

00:35:37.620 --> 00:35:40.280
to make sure that all the
populations in our company

00:35:40.280 --> 00:35:46.100
really had an opportunity to
contribute to what they felt

00:35:46.100 --> 00:35:48.120
was good or not good,
what they wanted to see,

00:35:48.120 --> 00:35:49.870
what they didn't want to see.

00:35:49.870 --> 00:35:53.680
And so we got a bunch
of rich feedback,

00:35:53.680 --> 00:35:55.740
kept modifying the
drafts, and then

00:35:55.740 --> 00:35:59.790
rolled out with our final
vision at the end of 2013.

00:35:59.790 --> 00:36:03.240
And so it's a 2024
vision, and in it our goal

00:36:03.240 --> 00:36:06.820
is to have one to three
new businesses by 2024.

00:36:06.820 --> 00:36:10.950
So continued slow,
deliberate growth

00:36:10.950 --> 00:36:14.670
but businesses that are
synergistic with each other.

00:36:14.670 --> 00:36:16.480
We're also a unique model.

00:36:16.480 --> 00:36:18.990
All the businesses share
a lot of resources.

00:36:18.990 --> 00:36:20.840
There's a lot of
interbusiness between them,

00:36:20.840 --> 00:36:24.410
like our creamery sells
baked goods and ice

00:36:24.410 --> 00:36:27.550
cream to the two markets
and to our catering company.

00:36:27.550 --> 00:36:30.390
And so we wanted to make sure
that the businesses continue

00:36:30.390 --> 00:36:36.230
to have that interconnectivity
that makes us, I think,

00:36:36.230 --> 00:36:41.100
so dynamic and creates a
much stronger foundation

00:36:41.100 --> 00:36:44.900
but also wanted to stay
here in San Francisco,

00:36:44.900 --> 00:36:47.250
in communities where
we feel we can go deep.

00:36:47.250 --> 00:36:52.160
For us, it's really not about
the volume of what we do.

00:36:52.160 --> 00:36:54.350
It's about the
impact that we have

00:36:54.350 --> 00:36:57.810
and continuing to get
closer to achieving

00:36:57.810 --> 00:36:59.660
our mission of
creating community

00:36:59.660 --> 00:37:01.840
and seeing social change happen.

00:37:01.840 --> 00:37:04.440
So that's the plan.

00:37:04.440 --> 00:37:11.480
We're starting rumblings of what
maybe the third store might be.

00:37:11.480 --> 00:37:17.020
So I think next year, 2017,
determining that next step will

00:37:17.020 --> 00:37:19.682
be part of our strategic plan.

00:37:19.682 --> 00:37:21.140
JESS: So to the
point of community,

00:37:21.140 --> 00:37:23.556
Sarah, I know we've talked a
lot about the cooking classes

00:37:23.556 --> 00:37:25.530
at 18 Reasons, but
I'd also love for you

00:37:25.530 --> 00:37:28.480
to talk a little bit about
the Feed Your People events

00:37:28.480 --> 00:37:32.357
and community dinners,
because I, at least, found

00:37:32.357 --> 00:37:34.190
that to be a really
interesting thing that I

00:37:34.190 --> 00:37:35.730
didn't know about 18 Reasons.

00:37:35.730 --> 00:37:36.760
SARAH NELSON: Yeah.

00:37:36.760 --> 00:37:40.450
Another unique thing that we do
that a lot of cooking schools

00:37:40.450 --> 00:37:44.030
don't do is we open our
doors for dinners a couple

00:37:44.030 --> 00:37:45.100
times a month.

00:37:45.100 --> 00:37:46.860
So on the last
Wednesday of the month,

00:37:46.860 --> 00:37:49.670
we do a $10 dinner--
a community dinner.

00:37:49.670 --> 00:37:52.610
We do two seatings of 40
people, and 18 Reasons

00:37:52.610 --> 00:37:54.480
is about half the
size of this room.

00:37:54.480 --> 00:37:57.470
So you can imagine 40 people
coming on in, squeezing

00:37:57.470 --> 00:38:02.360
together, eating one plate of
food that could be anything.

00:38:02.360 --> 00:38:04.297
This month, two
of our volunteers

00:38:04.297 --> 00:38:05.630
are actually cooking the dinner.

00:38:05.630 --> 00:38:08.290
They're a brother and sister
who grew up in Martinique,

00:38:08.290 --> 00:38:10.830
and they're doing a kind of
French-Caribbean community

00:38:10.830 --> 00:38:12.190
dinner.

00:38:12.190 --> 00:38:13.720
Last month, we had a fish fry.

00:38:13.720 --> 00:38:16.060
Our Jam and Preserving
teacher who grew up in Harlem

00:38:16.060 --> 00:38:19.370
having fried fish every Friday
night, wanted to do a fish fry.

00:38:19.370 --> 00:38:24.170
So we made fried fish
sandwiches with a heroic butcher

00:38:24.170 --> 00:38:27.700
from Bi-Rite helping us out with
the fish and frying fish for 40

00:38:27.700 --> 00:38:30.460
people in a pan about this big.

00:38:30.460 --> 00:38:33.260
And next month
actually Bi-Rite is

00:38:33.260 --> 00:38:37.290
going to work with us to do some
of their dinner deli specials

00:38:37.290 --> 00:38:39.000
for the community dinner.

00:38:39.000 --> 00:38:41.400
In October, we usually
do an Oktoberfest sausage

00:38:41.400 --> 00:38:44.340
and sauerkraut business
where I make sauerkraut.

00:38:44.340 --> 00:38:46.470
I love fermenting
and preserving.

00:38:46.470 --> 00:38:48.607
And our chef cooks the sausages.

00:38:48.607 --> 00:38:51.065
And it's really just whatever
pops into our mind that month

00:38:51.065 --> 00:38:52.606
that seems like it
would be fun to do

00:38:52.606 --> 00:38:53.812
and that people would enjoy.

00:38:53.812 --> 00:38:56.020
It's totally different, and
we do two seatings of 40,

00:38:56.020 --> 00:38:57.560
so we have 80 people
coming through.

00:38:57.560 --> 00:38:58.820
We have a lot of regulars.

00:38:58.820 --> 00:39:01.040
The first seating, a lot
of people bring their kids.

00:39:01.040 --> 00:39:03.540
The second seating, a lot of
people bring bottles of wine.

00:39:03.540 --> 00:39:05.970
And people just hang out
and meet their neighbors,

00:39:05.970 --> 00:39:06.990
have a great time.

00:39:06.990 --> 00:39:08.690
And through our
community dinners,

00:39:08.690 --> 00:39:11.490
we met a cookbook author
named Leslie Jonath, who

00:39:11.490 --> 00:39:14.670
wanted to put together a
book of big-batch recipes.

00:39:14.670 --> 00:39:18.180
So how to cook for a
crowd or with the crowd,

00:39:18.180 --> 00:39:20.250
and this book is called
"Feed Your People."

00:39:20.250 --> 00:39:22.500
It's coming out
next year, and it's

00:39:22.500 --> 00:39:25.190
a collaboration between
18 Reasons and Leslie

00:39:25.190 --> 00:39:27.480
and a bunch of chefs from
all over the country.

00:39:27.480 --> 00:39:31.250
So she asked restaurant chefs
and home cooks and people

00:39:31.250 --> 00:39:33.530
she found out about who were
famous in their community

00:39:33.530 --> 00:39:36.072
for having big gatherings and
got recipes, not something they

00:39:36.072 --> 00:39:38.154
would make in their
restaurant, but what would you

00:39:38.154 --> 00:39:40.560
cook if you had 20 people
coming over to your house?

00:39:40.560 --> 00:39:43.160
And so it's got everything
from like seafood boils

00:39:43.160 --> 00:39:46.664
to tamale making
parties to slab pie.

00:39:46.664 --> 00:39:48.830
This is my favorite recipe
that I learned this year.

00:39:48.830 --> 00:39:53.480
Take a giant cookie sheet,
dough, fruit, dough,

00:39:53.480 --> 00:39:55.490
bake it like a giant Pop-tart.

00:39:55.490 --> 00:39:57.230
It's so good.

00:39:57.230 --> 00:39:58.470
Oh, my god.

00:39:58.470 --> 00:39:59.980
So that's going in the book.

00:39:59.980 --> 00:40:02.080
And we started
doing some dinners

00:40:02.080 --> 00:40:04.330
with some chefs who had been
contributing to the book.

00:40:04.330 --> 00:40:07.364
So our next door
neighbor is Namu Gaji.

00:40:07.364 --> 00:40:08.280
Has anyone been there?

00:40:08.280 --> 00:40:10.140
The Korean-Japanese
place on the corner?

00:40:10.140 --> 00:40:13.750
So we did a Bo Ssam, a
big traditional dinner

00:40:13.750 --> 00:40:17.530
with pork belly and oysters
and all these things with them.

00:40:17.530 --> 00:40:22.870
Pableaux Johnson, who's an
advocate for New Orleans food

00:40:22.870 --> 00:40:25.050
culture, is coming with
his rice and beans road

00:40:25.050 --> 00:40:26.720
show next Monday.

00:40:26.720 --> 00:40:29.649
Rice and beans traditionally
eaten on Mondays in New Orleans

00:40:29.649 --> 00:40:31.190
while people are
doing their laundry,

00:40:31.190 --> 00:40:33.760
cooking something
easy, and he's coming.

00:40:33.760 --> 00:40:35.640
We're going to do 40
people, rice and beans.

00:40:35.640 --> 00:40:38.030
It's kind of a Feed
Your People event.

00:40:38.030 --> 00:40:41.720
So we're always trying to
bring people in to 18 Reasons.

00:40:41.720 --> 00:40:44.897
We want people to cook, but it's
kind of a little secret part

00:40:44.897 --> 00:40:45.480
of 18 Reasons.

00:40:45.480 --> 00:40:47.771
If you don't like to cook,
there's still stuff for you.

00:40:47.771 --> 00:40:49.980
You can come and
experience home cooking

00:40:49.980 --> 00:40:51.820
that other people
have cooked for you.

00:40:51.820 --> 00:40:54.290
So our Feed Your People dinners
and our monthly community

00:40:54.290 --> 00:40:56.840
dinner are a great way
to come and check us out.

00:40:56.840 --> 00:40:57.990
SAM MOGANNAM: And to
meet your neighbors.

00:40:57.990 --> 00:40:58.300
SARAH NELSON: Yeah.

00:40:58.300 --> 00:40:59.340
SAM MOGANNAM: That's one of the
things that I love about it.

00:40:59.340 --> 00:41:00.390
SARAH NELSON: It's
eight people at a table.

00:41:00.390 --> 00:41:02.139
So you're definitely
going to meet people.

00:41:02.139 --> 00:41:03.410
SAM MOGANNAM: That's cool.

00:41:03.410 --> 00:41:05.440
AUDIENCE: So Sam, you
mentioned that after kind

00:41:05.440 --> 00:41:06.890
of evaluating your
long-term plan,

00:41:06.890 --> 00:41:09.780
you had the interest to focus
your efforts in the Bay Area.

00:41:09.780 --> 00:41:12.750
But a lot of the issues that
you guys described about people

00:41:12.750 --> 00:41:14.360
not knowing how
to eat sustainably

00:41:14.360 --> 00:41:17.560
or not knowing how to cook is
a pretty big issue nationally,

00:41:17.560 --> 00:41:18.450
internationally.

00:41:18.450 --> 00:41:19.960
And I think that
what you've done

00:41:19.960 --> 00:41:22.390
is actually a great
model for expanding

00:41:22.390 --> 00:41:24.580
this type of
education and covering

00:41:24.580 --> 00:41:26.720
these issues elsewhere.

00:41:26.720 --> 00:41:29.580
So aside from not having
a physical presence there,

00:41:29.580 --> 00:41:31.192
is there any kind
of alternative thing

00:41:31.192 --> 00:41:33.650
that you guys have been thinking
about where you can expand

00:41:33.650 --> 00:41:36.750
your influence in other parts
of the US, to maybe bring

00:41:36.750 --> 00:41:39.500
your lessons and your
expertise to solve

00:41:39.500 --> 00:41:40.630
these problems elsewhere?

00:41:40.630 --> 00:41:41.421
SAM MOGANNAM: Yeah.

00:41:41.421 --> 00:41:43.790
I think we've done
a lot in that arena.

00:41:46.920 --> 00:41:50.770
I saw several people buying
the book, "Eat Good Food."

00:41:50.770 --> 00:41:54.770
That was written with
specifically that intent,

00:41:54.770 --> 00:41:58.240
to be that empowering-- that
teaching tool-- to give people

00:41:58.240 --> 00:42:02.247
the basics that they needed to
know while they were shopping

00:42:02.247 --> 00:42:04.830
in the grocery store or wherever
they were getting their food.

00:42:04.830 --> 00:42:09.550
And really, for me, it distills
down to the five key questions

00:42:09.550 --> 00:42:12.760
that I think anybody
who's going to eat

00:42:12.760 --> 00:42:15.609
and who's in a position of
buying food should be asking.

00:42:15.609 --> 00:42:16.900
Where is that food coming from?

00:42:16.900 --> 00:42:17.640
How is it grown?

00:42:17.640 --> 00:42:18.740
Who grew it?

00:42:18.740 --> 00:42:19.270
Right?

00:42:19.270 --> 00:42:21.820
Where it was grown
and how it tastes.

00:42:21.820 --> 00:42:23.420
And it's really
incredible, if you

00:42:23.420 --> 00:42:26.220
walk into any
traditional supermarket

00:42:26.220 --> 00:42:29.100
and ask one of those
questions to whoever

00:42:29.100 --> 00:42:30.740
is working in the
produce department,

00:42:30.740 --> 00:42:32.370
they won't know the answer.

00:42:32.370 --> 00:42:35.970
The answer that really depresses
me that they can't answer

00:42:35.970 --> 00:42:37.010
is how it tastes.

00:42:37.010 --> 00:42:38.690
The people working
in those stores

00:42:38.690 --> 00:42:40.740
themselves couldn't tell
you which of the apples

00:42:40.740 --> 00:42:42.510
was the best tasting apples,
because they haven't really

00:42:42.510 --> 00:42:43.160
taken the time.

00:42:43.160 --> 00:42:47.080
And it's not really of value
to them in that company.

00:42:47.080 --> 00:42:51.860
So I think the book has
sold over 30,000 copies

00:42:51.860 --> 00:42:55.210
and some schools have bought it.

00:42:55.210 --> 00:42:58.490
That's one thing that I
think has been a huge help.

00:42:58.490 --> 00:43:02.310
And I know several grocery
stores use it as well

00:43:02.310 --> 00:43:05.050
to train and teach their staff.

00:43:05.050 --> 00:43:08.930
I speak and I talk at
conferences fairly regularly,

00:43:08.930 --> 00:43:10.430
trying to influence
other retailers.

00:43:10.430 --> 00:43:13.910
I belong to a few
retailer organizations,

00:43:13.910 --> 00:43:16.160
and we're really transparent
and open about everything

00:43:16.160 --> 00:43:16.960
that we do.

00:43:16.960 --> 00:43:20.490
We share our business practices,
we share our staff manual,

00:43:20.490 --> 00:43:22.480
we share our training
material, because I want

00:43:22.480 --> 00:43:25.560
other independents to succeed.

00:43:25.560 --> 00:43:30.570
It's really important for me
to see community-based markets

00:43:30.570 --> 00:43:33.730
and community-based
organizations of all kinds

00:43:33.730 --> 00:43:36.890
really thrive,
because they become

00:43:36.890 --> 00:43:41.800
really amazing identifiers for
the people that live there.

00:43:41.800 --> 00:43:45.900
Bi-Rite's a really great example
of kind of a transformation

00:43:45.900 --> 00:43:47.240
of a community.

00:43:47.240 --> 00:43:51.260
Even though the market was
in my family since 1964,

00:43:51.260 --> 00:43:55.120
it went out of our
family from 1989 to 1997.

00:43:55.120 --> 00:43:57.995
And the neighborhood really went
through a pretty crappy period

00:43:57.995 --> 00:43:58.495
of time.

00:43:58.495 --> 00:44:01.380
Dolores Park was taken
over by a couple of gangs,

00:44:01.380 --> 00:44:05.430
and my dad would never let me
go play there when I was a kid,

00:44:05.430 --> 00:44:08.740
because it was pretty rough.

00:44:08.740 --> 00:44:13.550
By the time that we got the
store back in 1997, because it

00:44:13.550 --> 00:44:15.510
was out of our family,
there were metal grates

00:44:15.510 --> 00:44:17.864
on the windows, and all the
storefronts on 18th Street

00:44:17.864 --> 00:44:19.280
had metal grates
on their windows,

00:44:19.280 --> 00:44:21.772
because break-ins
were pretty normal.

00:44:21.772 --> 00:44:23.230
And there were less
than-- with all

00:44:23.230 --> 00:44:25.605
those commercial storefronts,
there was probably like 25,

00:44:25.605 --> 00:44:31.820
30 people employed on that
block, and after we opened,

00:44:31.820 --> 00:44:34.010
Delfina opened a
few months later,

00:44:34.010 --> 00:44:37.817
Tartine opened, Namu
Gaji, Izakaya's, Yuzuki.

00:44:37.817 --> 00:44:39.650
There's a lot of new
businesses, and there's

00:44:39.650 --> 00:44:42.300
like over 400 people now
working on that block, one

00:44:42.300 --> 00:44:43.040
single block.

00:44:45.600 --> 00:44:49.080
And that block has kind
of become a real example

00:44:49.080 --> 00:44:53.885
of a community hub in a lot
of ways around the country,

00:44:53.885 --> 00:44:58.390
and it's really identified
by a lot of developers

00:44:58.390 --> 00:45:02.710
as like a model for
what they envision

00:45:02.710 --> 00:45:05.560
in transforming communities.

00:45:05.560 --> 00:45:10.140
And so we've been
this influence,

00:45:10.140 --> 00:45:14.870
I guess, and this inspiration
for community development

00:45:14.870 --> 00:45:18.250
but also for just other
retailers and other businesses

00:45:18.250 --> 00:45:22.930
that are just not looking at
business as a means of bringing

00:45:22.930 --> 00:45:29.610
a bottom line, but as a means
of building relationships

00:45:29.610 --> 00:45:33.090
and creating a stronger fabric
in the community, a tighter

00:45:33.090 --> 00:45:33.878
fabric.

00:45:33.878 --> 00:45:36.252
SARAH NELSON: You also invented
salted caramel ice cream.

00:45:36.252 --> 00:45:38.460
SAM MOGANNAM: Yeah, we did.

00:45:38.460 --> 00:45:40.699
SARAH NELSON: Huge influence.

00:45:40.699 --> 00:45:42.490
SAM MOGANNAM: We were
actually just talking

00:45:42.490 --> 00:45:44.150
about this yesterday.

00:45:44.150 --> 00:45:48.730
And sometimes our generosity
and sharing has bitten us.

00:45:48.730 --> 00:45:51.100
There was a woman who was
planning on opening up

00:45:51.100 --> 00:45:53.700
an ice cream shop in
Seattle who wanted to spend

00:45:53.700 --> 00:45:55.270
a couple of days with us.

00:45:55.270 --> 00:45:57.740
And we let her,
because when went

00:45:57.740 --> 00:46:03.930
to open up the creamery,
nobody that owned an ice cream

00:46:03.930 --> 00:46:06.200
store would actually let
us spend any time with them

00:46:06.200 --> 00:46:08.620
to learn how to use
the Emery Thompson,

00:46:08.620 --> 00:46:11.520
this machine-- this batch
freezer that makes ice cream.

00:46:11.520 --> 00:46:14.480
And my wife Anne, who
developed the recipes

00:46:14.480 --> 00:46:17.229
and is our head pastry
chef, during her time

00:46:17.229 --> 00:46:18.770
as a pastry chef in
restaurants, we'd

00:46:18.770 --> 00:46:20.740
use one of those
old-school White Mountains,

00:46:20.740 --> 00:46:23.370
you know, like the wooden
bucket with the ice and the salt

00:46:23.370 --> 00:46:25.941
and it would crank
and go eehhh, and then

00:46:25.941 --> 00:46:27.440
you'd know that ice
cream was almost

00:46:27.440 --> 00:46:29.523
done when the motor was
struggling because the ice

00:46:29.523 --> 00:46:30.350
cream was thick.

00:46:30.350 --> 00:46:32.891
And so we had no idea how to
use these larger batch freezers.

00:46:32.891 --> 00:46:36.310
And so we made a commitment
saying, you know what?

00:46:36.310 --> 00:46:39.710
Everyone shut us out, but we're
not going to shut people out.

00:46:39.710 --> 00:46:43.530
And so she came and spent
a couple days with us

00:46:43.530 --> 00:46:44.880
and opened up her shop.

00:46:44.880 --> 00:46:48.070
And she had salted
caramel, honey lavender,

00:46:48.070 --> 00:46:52.380
balsamic strawberry,
roasted banana.

00:46:52.380 --> 00:46:57.480
But the kicker was she had Sam's
Sunday on the menu as well.

00:46:57.480 --> 00:47:00.450
JESS: So I just want to ask one
last question as we wrap up,

00:47:00.450 --> 00:47:03.690
and I also want to thank,
first of all, Paige,

00:47:03.690 --> 00:47:05.190
who is hiding in the audience.

00:47:05.190 --> 00:47:06.990
Paige is our farmers'
market specialist,

00:47:06.990 --> 00:47:10.180
and she arranged all
this, and she is awesome

00:47:10.180 --> 00:47:11.736
if you get a chance
to talk to her.

00:47:14.270 --> 00:47:17.000
As you mentioned, this is
a room full of the choir,

00:47:17.000 --> 00:47:18.880
and so I just want
to ask you, what

00:47:18.880 --> 00:47:21.130
can the people here
who are already

00:47:21.130 --> 00:47:24.660
engaged home cooks do to
help the people around them

00:47:24.660 --> 00:47:28.321
become more engaged in
community of food and home

00:47:28.321 --> 00:47:30.820
cooking and self-empowerment
and all of the wonderful things

00:47:30.820 --> 00:47:33.590
that you guys
talked about today?

00:47:33.590 --> 00:47:35.870
SARAH NELSON: Invite your
friends over for dinner.

00:47:35.870 --> 00:47:38.460
I know in cities, and I think
this is more true in New York,

00:47:38.460 --> 00:47:40.660
people don't go out because
their houses are too small.

00:47:40.660 --> 00:47:41.760
But people don't cook at home.

00:47:41.760 --> 00:47:42.885
Their houses are too small.

00:47:42.885 --> 00:47:43.940
Everyone's going out.

00:47:43.940 --> 00:47:45.730
And in San Francisco,
people go out a lot.

00:47:45.730 --> 00:47:47.438
There are a lot of
wonderful restaurants,

00:47:47.438 --> 00:47:49.190
and it's fun to
meet friends out.

00:47:49.190 --> 00:47:52.330
But it's also really fun
to cook together at home.

00:47:52.330 --> 00:47:53.580
In most cases, it's healthier.

00:47:53.580 --> 00:47:55.850
In most cases, it'll
save you money.

00:47:55.850 --> 00:47:57.580
In most cases, you'll
have more fun too.

00:47:57.580 --> 00:47:59.231
I used to live in
Paris, and in Paris

00:47:59.231 --> 00:48:00.730
you go out to dinner
at 8:00 and you

00:48:00.730 --> 00:48:01.770
leave the restaurant
at midnight,

00:48:01.770 --> 00:48:02.990
and that was your
plan for the night.

00:48:02.990 --> 00:48:03.491
That's it.

00:48:03.491 --> 00:48:04.906
Here, you go to a
restaurant 8:00,

00:48:04.906 --> 00:48:06.370
you're back on the
street at 9:00,

00:48:06.370 --> 00:48:08.300
which means you have to go
spend more money at a bar

00:48:08.300 --> 00:48:09.220
or something if you want
to keep hanging out, right?

00:48:09.220 --> 00:48:11.280
When I moved back here,
I couldn't believe it.

00:48:11.280 --> 00:48:11.990
I'm like, what are we doing?

00:48:11.990 --> 00:48:12.781
What do we do next?

00:48:12.781 --> 00:48:13.646
It's only 9:00.

00:48:13.646 --> 00:48:15.520
But if you're at home,
there's no time limit.

00:48:15.520 --> 00:48:16.660
No one's going to
turn your table.

00:48:16.660 --> 00:48:18.025
You can hang out as
long as you want,

00:48:18.025 --> 00:48:19.860
and you actually linger
and enjoy your meal

00:48:19.860 --> 00:48:21.790
and hang out with your friends
as long as you want to.

00:48:21.790 --> 00:48:22.970
SAM MOGANNAM: And drink as
much wine as you want to.

00:48:22.970 --> 00:48:24.969
SARAH NELSON: Drink as
much wine as you want to,

00:48:24.969 --> 00:48:26.070
and it's half the price.

00:48:26.070 --> 00:48:27.236
SAM MOGANNAM: Yeah, I agree.

00:48:27.236 --> 00:48:31.156
I think cooking more is a great
way to inspire others to cook,

00:48:31.156 --> 00:48:33.030
and feeding people is
such a wonderful thing.

00:48:33.030 --> 00:48:36.280
I also think coming
to 18 Reasons,

00:48:36.280 --> 00:48:39.490
we rely on a network
of 900 volunteers

00:48:39.490 --> 00:48:41.340
to do the work that we do.

00:48:41.340 --> 00:48:43.050
The cooking, the
free programming,

00:48:43.050 --> 00:48:46.940
we're teaching 2,500
students a year,

00:48:46.940 --> 00:48:50.190
and we only have a paid staff
of 10, and several of those

00:48:50.190 --> 00:48:53.010
are AmeriCorps volunteers.

00:48:53.010 --> 00:48:55.780
It takes a village to
make this work happen,

00:48:55.780 --> 00:48:58.980
and it's happening in the
five Bay Area counties.

00:48:58.980 --> 00:49:05.360
And so we always need support,
both in time and financial.

00:49:05.360 --> 00:49:07.530
It would be a huge
thing to help with.

00:49:07.530 --> 00:49:11.670
And attending classes at
18 Reasons as well, I feel,

00:49:11.670 --> 00:49:15.412
is so important
because you're actually

00:49:15.412 --> 00:49:17.620
getting to know the people
that live in the community

00:49:17.620 --> 00:49:20.430
that you live and work in.

00:49:20.430 --> 00:49:23.690
And that, to me, is what
makes our society stronger.

00:49:23.690 --> 00:49:25.380
The more people
that we get to know,

00:49:25.380 --> 00:49:29.010
the more diverse the
population of people

00:49:29.010 --> 00:49:31.937
that we interact with,
the more empathetic

00:49:31.937 --> 00:49:33.520
and I think the more
empowered that we

00:49:33.520 --> 00:49:39.610
are with our view of what
a strong, tight, successful

00:49:39.610 --> 00:49:41.200
community looks like.

00:49:41.200 --> 00:49:43.460
JESS: Thank you guys
so much for being here.

00:49:43.460 --> 00:49:44.910
It's awesome, and
it was an honor.

00:49:44.910 --> 00:49:45.430
SAM MOGANNAM: Thanks.

00:49:45.430 --> 00:49:47.330
JESS: And thank you all
for sticking around,

00:49:47.330 --> 00:49:49.720
and now there will be ice cream.

00:49:49.720 --> 00:49:52.770
[APPLAUSE]
