00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
We're here in Leiden  in the Netherlands.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:05.000
Everything that you see around me was once completely submerged in water.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000
The only reason why the Netherlands is still dry today

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000
is because a series of dikes have been constructed around the country.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:17.000
Now even with these dikes, we still need to constantly move water from low to high

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:21.000
or as we learn to say by the end of this unit, we need to do work on the water

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.000
to move at some place of low potential energy to places of high potential energy.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:30.000
Today, the dikes that surround the Netherlands help to keep its 17 million inhabitants safe

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:35.000
but without human intervention, all the areas that you see in blue would be submerge.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:39.000
Since so much of the country is actually below sea level.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:44.000
Of course this setup isn't perfect, water constantly must be transported up and away from land.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.000
One tool, the Archimedes' screw uses power

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:51.000
from the Dutch windmills to transport this water and keep the Netherlands dry.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:56.000
We learned about forces in the last unit but thinking in terms of forces may not be enough

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.000
to understand this complex problem.
