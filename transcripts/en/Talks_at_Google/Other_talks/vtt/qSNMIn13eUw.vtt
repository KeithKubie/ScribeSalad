00:00:02.540 --> 00:00:04.080
ARJAN DIJIK: Welcome, everybody.

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:06.090
Quickly introducing
myself, I'm Arjan.

00:00:06.090 --> 00:00:07.365
I work in marketing.

00:00:07.365 --> 00:00:10.840
And I'm delighted today that
we have Lord Browne here.

00:00:10.840 --> 00:00:13.670
And I had the honor--
probably in May this year--

00:00:13.670 --> 00:00:14.670
to meet him personally--

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:15.961
LORD JOHN BROWNE: That's right.

00:00:15.961 --> 00:00:20.100
ARJAN DIJIK: --in London, just
before your book was released.

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:22.150
And I read the book,
actually, and I really

00:00:22.150 --> 00:00:23.720
recommend to everybody,
if you haven't done so,

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:24.428
to read the book.

00:00:24.428 --> 00:00:26.459
Because it is really
the kind of LGBT

00:00:26.459 --> 00:00:28.250
lean in-- you might
not like this analogy--

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:30.352
but I thought it was
really well researched.

00:00:30.352 --> 00:00:32.060
LORD JOHN BROWNE:
Sheryl may not like it.

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:33.310
ARJAN DIJIK: Sheryl
might not like it.

00:00:33.310 --> 00:00:35.010
But it was really
well researched.

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:37.715
There was really a lot of things
were in there that I said, hmm,

00:00:37.715 --> 00:00:38.640
I didn't know that.

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:39.800
And I really enjoyed it.

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:43.350
And Lord Browne, of course,
can introduce himself.

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:45.790
I will say a couple of things.

00:00:45.790 --> 00:00:49.120
He was 13 years, I
think, CEO of BP.

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:52.320
I don't have to explain
BP to anybody of you.

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:56.020
I think the share price
quintupled, if that's English.

00:00:56.020 --> 00:00:57.760
I think that's English.

00:00:57.760 --> 00:00:59.740
So that's pretty amazing.

00:00:59.740 --> 00:01:05.560
And so that all sounds really
all very nice and great.

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:08.150
But I think at the end
of your tenure, suddenly,

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:12.630
you were very publicly
outed as a gay man

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:14.369
by the wonderful UK papers.

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:16.410
I don't know if there's
anybody here from the UK.

00:01:16.410 --> 00:01:18.912
But if you want to get
depressed, you know,

00:01:18.912 --> 00:01:19.870
it's a guilty pleasure.

00:01:19.870 --> 00:01:21.625
I do, when you're in the
British Airways lounge,

00:01:21.625 --> 00:01:22.670
you read the "Daily Mail."

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:24.340
I don't know if you've
ever read the "Daily Mail,"

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:25.780
but you really
don't want to live.

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:30.440
It's really quite sharp
and quite negative.

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:33.792
LORD JOHN BROWNE: I think
it's tamed itself a bit,

00:01:33.792 --> 00:01:34.750
compared with the past.

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:35.916
ARJAN DIJIK: Yeah, probably.

00:01:35.916 --> 00:01:40.050
And so the idea is really
that we start off, maybe,

00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:42.379
with a couple of
questions that I prepared.

00:01:42.379 --> 00:01:43.920
But the whole idea
is, you know, it's

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:45.480
a Google Talk that
anybody of you

00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:47.450
can really ask him a question.

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:50.230
Also, he has done already
two talks in Google-- one

00:01:50.230 --> 00:01:53.120
in London and one in New York.

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:55.610
So clearly, Lord
Browne will have

00:01:55.610 --> 00:01:58.090
an opinion on what Google is.

00:01:58.090 --> 00:02:00.632
And we sometimes think
that we're terrific.

00:02:00.632 --> 00:02:01.590
I sometimes think that.

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:03.050
So are we really that terrific?

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:04.240
What could we do better?

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:07.580
Are we great at LGBT inclusion?

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:08.530
What about diversity?

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:11.950
And I'm sure you have a
lot of ideas around it.

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:15.770
But maybe a kickoff with
a very easy question.

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:17.530
So why did you write the book?

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:19.910
LORD JOHN BROWNE:
Well, good afternoon.

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:23.470
I wrote the book for a
few very simple reasons.

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:27.100
The first is-- and today
is a very important day.

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:29.810
I just was looking at
the list of our people

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:33.160
who are running significant
corporations around the world,

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:35.130
and I took the S&amp;P
list, and I had

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:41.020
to go down to S&amp;P number 723,
I think it was at the time,

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:44.376
before I found an out gay CEO.

00:02:44.376 --> 00:02:49.200
And I thought that's
statistically unusual.

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:55.260
Why is there only one person
in the top, let's say, 750

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:58.050
companies, who's out and gay?

00:02:58.050 --> 00:03:01.870
That got changed today
when Tim Cook came out.

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:04.090
So there are now
two, which is great.

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:05.740
But one very significant one.

00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:07.490
We'll come back to that.

00:03:07.490 --> 00:03:10.215
Secondly, I thought
to myself, I really

00:03:10.215 --> 00:03:14.070
didn't want anyone to go through
the same experience as I did.

00:03:14.070 --> 00:03:16.750
Thirdly, I thought
that, and I knew

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:19.310
that, in my own
experience, you can

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:24.420
talk to people about what to do,
how to think about themselves.

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:26.840
But the best way
of demonstrating it

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:29.250
is to find role
models that people

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:32.860
can identify with and find
a little piece of themselves

00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:36.160
in it to give them
confidence to be themselves,

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:41.510
to come out, to behave in an
authentic way in business.

00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:46.450
And finally, I wrote this book
to send a great big letter

00:03:46.450 --> 00:03:49.750
to the straight people
of the world, and said,

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:53.140
it's time that we
redoubled efforts

00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:57.960
to make inclusion of LGBT
people a big priority.

00:03:57.960 --> 00:04:02.060
And I gave them some
tips on how they'd do it.

00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:06.370
And I really focused it on the
leadership of corporations.

00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:10.350
The book's about corporations,
because I haven't been--

00:04:10.350 --> 00:04:12.290
I'm not a football player.

00:04:12.290 --> 00:04:14.640
I'm not an artist.

00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:19.110
I'm not in different walks of
life with different problems

00:04:19.110 --> 00:04:19.750
and issues.

00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:22.821
I'm a business person,
so I talk about business.

00:04:22.821 --> 00:04:23.570
ARJAN DIJIK: Yeah.

00:04:23.570 --> 00:04:26.970
And as a CEO of BP-- you
were there 13 years--

00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:28.110
you clearly had made it.

00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:31.054
The company was doing
incredibly well.

00:04:31.054 --> 00:04:32.720
How much more was
there to gain for you?

00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:34.819
So why didn't you come out?

00:04:34.819 --> 00:04:36.360
LORD JOHN BROWNE:
Well, because I was

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:37.526
used to being in the closet.

00:04:37.526 --> 00:04:40.840
I mean, it's an
amazingly trivial answer

00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:42.915
to a complex question.

00:04:42.915 --> 00:04:46.870
You have to go
back to my history.

00:04:46.870 --> 00:04:49.140
And some of it is
now irrelevant,

00:04:49.140 --> 00:04:51.940
but the outcome may
be very relevant.

00:04:51.940 --> 00:04:54.330
So I built myself two lives.

00:04:56.910 --> 00:05:01.570
And the reason I did that is
that when I could understand

00:05:01.570 --> 00:05:04.450
my sexuality, it was
actually illegal to do

00:05:04.450 --> 00:05:07.950
any homosexual act in
the UK, and in most

00:05:07.950 --> 00:05:10.290
of the states of the
United States of America.

00:05:10.290 --> 00:05:11.980
So it was a dangerous
position to be in.

00:05:11.980 --> 00:05:15.045
You could be blackmailed,
you could be threatened,

00:05:15.045 --> 00:05:16.540
you could be bullied.

00:05:16.540 --> 00:05:19.150
So I said, I think I'll
keep that to myself.

00:05:19.150 --> 00:05:21.820
And secondly, I
came from a family

00:05:21.820 --> 00:05:27.230
with my mother, who was a
survivor of the Holocaust--

00:05:27.230 --> 00:05:28.980
survivor of Auschwitz.

00:05:28.980 --> 00:05:32.940
And her couple of tips for
life, very strongly held,

00:05:32.940 --> 00:05:37.030
were, first, if you've got a
secret, don't tell anybody,

00:05:37.030 --> 00:05:40.900
because it's no longer a
secret if you tell one person.

00:05:40.900 --> 00:05:43.210
And secondly, just be
careful about being

00:05:43.210 --> 00:05:46.900
a member of a minority,
because minorities are always

00:05:46.900 --> 00:05:50.960
punished when the going
gets tough for the majority.

00:05:50.960 --> 00:05:53.030
And actually, in her
experience, that's

00:05:53.030 --> 00:05:55.170
exactly what she identified.

00:05:55.170 --> 00:05:57.490
So for me, it was a
pretty convincing case

00:05:57.490 --> 00:06:01.050
that I had to keep
two lives separate.

00:06:01.050 --> 00:06:03.530
When I was doing
this in my 20s, it

00:06:03.530 --> 00:06:05.140
felt exciting and interesting.

00:06:05.140 --> 00:06:06.980
It's like being
James Bond, you know?

00:06:06.980 --> 00:06:09.710
You have a legend,
and you have reality,

00:06:09.710 --> 00:06:12.230
and you must never
let them meet.

00:06:12.230 --> 00:06:16.990
And so I built this huge
edifice of two lives,

00:06:16.990 --> 00:06:18.460
and I got used to it.

00:06:18.460 --> 00:06:23.740
And I believe that as I was
getting more senior-- actually,

00:06:23.740 --> 00:06:27.490
as I was in business-- I thought
that if people knew I was gay,

00:06:27.490 --> 00:06:31.574
I'd lose supplier respect,
I'd lose customers,

00:06:31.574 --> 00:06:33.740
I wouldn't be able to deal
with foreign governments,

00:06:33.740 --> 00:06:37.940
and my peers would make fun of
me, and they'd think I'm weak.

00:06:37.940 --> 00:06:40.164
So I kept it to myself.

00:06:40.164 --> 00:06:42.580
And strangely, you know, because
there were no role models

00:06:42.580 --> 00:06:46.470
around, I didn't notice
the world changing,

00:06:46.470 --> 00:06:51.310
and I just kept those fears
in my head to the very end.

00:06:51.310 --> 00:06:57.890
And that's why I was outed
by a former boyfriend.

00:06:57.890 --> 00:07:00.450
A much more complex
story, but I was

00:07:00.450 --> 00:07:05.780
outed in the "Daily
Mail" group newspapers

00:07:05.780 --> 00:07:08.940
on the 1st of May, 2007.

00:07:08.940 --> 00:07:11.470
ARJAN DIJIK: And before we
go into that-- trust me,

00:07:11.470 --> 00:07:13.250
I have a couple of
difficult questions,

00:07:13.250 --> 00:07:16.090
but we're doing
the softballs now--

00:07:16.090 --> 00:07:17.590
LORD JOHN BROWNE:
This is a warm-up.

00:07:17.590 --> 00:07:20.442
ARJAN DIJIK: This is a warm-up.

00:07:20.442 --> 00:07:22.400
If I look at myself--
not to talk about myself,

00:07:22.400 --> 00:07:24.316
but everybody likes
talking about themselves--

00:07:24.316 --> 00:07:26.490
I came out late, you know?

00:07:26.490 --> 00:07:28.420
What happened is that
probably in my 20s,

00:07:28.420 --> 00:07:31.340
I was extremely focused
on work, because I didn't

00:07:31.340 --> 00:07:34.300
go through the kind of
normal relationships, ups

00:07:34.300 --> 00:07:38.440
and downs, the kind of
focusing on your personal life.

00:07:38.440 --> 00:07:41.600
So it meant, actually, that
I progressed my career,

00:07:41.600 --> 00:07:43.450
for my age, incredibly fast.

00:07:43.450 --> 00:07:48.637
So would you have been CEO of
BP if you-- It's a catch-22.

00:07:48.637 --> 00:07:50.595
LORD JOHN BROWNE: It's
a hypothetical question.

00:07:50.595 --> 00:07:50.910
ARJAN DIJIK: I know.

00:07:50.910 --> 00:07:52.618
LORD JOHN BROWNE:
Because you never know.

00:07:52.618 --> 00:07:56.630
Because what you take away,
you get on another basis.

00:07:56.630 --> 00:07:58.880
So I was very
focused on my work.

00:07:58.880 --> 00:08:01.220
I was probably obsessively
focused on my work

00:08:01.220 --> 00:08:03.640
throughout my entire career.

00:08:03.640 --> 00:08:04.710
That's also true.

00:08:04.710 --> 00:08:06.690
And I didn't have
these relationships,

00:08:06.690 --> 00:08:10.270
but I had a lot of
interference from trying

00:08:10.270 --> 00:08:13.400
to get relationships
in a half-baked way.

00:08:13.400 --> 00:08:16.100
Because you can't actually
have a relationship

00:08:16.100 --> 00:08:18.080
if you're only half a person.

00:08:18.080 --> 00:08:22.070
It's rather difficult
to make that work.

00:08:22.070 --> 00:08:29.190
And I think in work, I
think what I became--

00:08:29.190 --> 00:08:33.179
a friend of mine in the
city here, San Francisco,

00:08:33.179 --> 00:08:37.937
said to me-- she's a lesbian,
a bisexual woman-- she said,

00:08:37.937 --> 00:08:40.270
"Well, I always knew there
was something wrong with you,

00:08:40.270 --> 00:08:45.870
because even as an Englishman,
you redefined the word

00:08:45.870 --> 00:08:48.840
'reserved.'"

00:08:48.840 --> 00:08:53.090
And that was my protection.

00:08:53.090 --> 00:08:57.900
I just didn't engage
on any personal matter

00:08:57.900 --> 00:08:58.950
with people at work.

00:08:58.950 --> 00:09:02.740
And as a result, I was
regarded with-- while I

00:09:02.740 --> 00:09:06.790
think people followed me,
I think they followed me

00:09:06.790 --> 00:09:10.400
with a high degree of
concern that no one could

00:09:10.400 --> 00:09:12.370
see behind the veil.

00:09:12.370 --> 00:09:16.537
There was a lot going on
which no one could see,

00:09:16.537 --> 00:09:18.830
and I didn't let them see.

00:09:18.830 --> 00:09:20.920
ARJAN DIJIK: So that's
very interesting.

00:09:20.920 --> 00:09:23.220
And now, getting to the
more difficult ones.

00:09:23.220 --> 00:09:24.760
So you're a very
smart businessman.

00:09:24.760 --> 00:09:25.926
You've been very successful.

00:09:25.926 --> 00:09:28.270
You're very good
at assessing risks.

00:09:28.270 --> 00:09:32.470
So you start a relationship
with a 24-year-old escort.

00:09:32.470 --> 00:09:34.050
That sounds like risky to me.

00:09:34.050 --> 00:09:37.070
LORD JOHN BROWNE: Well,
so here's the thing.

00:09:37.070 --> 00:09:41.840
I think, certainly,
conducting a life like mine,

00:09:41.840 --> 00:09:45.660
I think it's taught me how
to read people very quickly

00:09:45.660 --> 00:09:47.540
and how to be
dynamically positioned

00:09:47.540 --> 00:09:53.140
and how to understand
people quite well.

00:09:53.140 --> 00:09:54.470
But here's the logic.

00:09:54.470 --> 00:09:56.850
This is the mad logic.

00:09:56.850 --> 00:10:01.010
So I got to a very
senior position in BP,

00:10:01.010 --> 00:10:04.170
and I know it's
the oil business,

00:10:04.170 --> 00:10:09.010
but I was very visible, and
I was very recognizable.

00:10:09.010 --> 00:10:12.810
Wherever I went, people
would recognize who I was.

00:10:12.810 --> 00:10:14.940
Because at the
time, BP, I think,

00:10:14.940 --> 00:10:18.840
was the third largest
company in the world.

00:10:18.840 --> 00:10:23.310
So I decided that
logically, therefore,

00:10:23.310 --> 00:10:25.430
I couldn't go out
to meet somebody.

00:10:25.430 --> 00:10:27.350
But I wanted to have somebody.

00:10:27.350 --> 00:10:34.430
So the answer was the safety
of an escort website, which

00:10:34.430 --> 00:10:37.480
I thought was obviously
very safe, because I didn't

00:10:37.480 --> 00:10:39.710
have to tell anyone about it.

00:10:39.710 --> 00:10:44.790
So that was judgment
error number one.

00:10:44.790 --> 00:10:48.570
Number two error, because
all errors come in threes,

00:10:48.570 --> 00:10:52.750
was to meet someone, I actually
believed that a person I met

00:10:52.750 --> 00:10:57.490
in that way, I could
build a relationship with,

00:10:57.490 --> 00:10:58.920
which I couldn't.

00:10:58.920 --> 00:11:01.230
And the third error
of judgment was

00:11:01.230 --> 00:11:05.230
to have a cover story
about how I met him,

00:11:05.230 --> 00:11:09.350
and to believe that I could
maintain that story even

00:11:09.350 --> 00:11:15.920
as I was going to court to
prevent this story being

00:11:15.920 --> 00:11:16.850
published.

00:11:16.850 --> 00:11:21.350
So I actually lied in
a witness statement,

00:11:21.350 --> 00:11:23.520
which I corrected very
quickly, because I

00:11:23.520 --> 00:11:25.230
couldn't believe I'd done it.

00:11:25.230 --> 00:11:27.350
So someone-- I think
probably my inner self

00:11:27.350 --> 00:11:31.160
slapped me in the
face and said stop it.

00:11:31.160 --> 00:11:33.646
So three errors of
judgment in a row.

00:11:33.646 --> 00:11:37.732
ARJAN DIJIK: I think there's a
fourth one, if you don't mind.

00:11:37.732 --> 00:11:38.940
LORD JOHN BROWNE: No, please.

00:11:38.940 --> 00:11:41.110
ARJAN DIJIK: Which is
you hired a top law firm.

00:11:41.110 --> 00:11:44.527
So, shouldn't you have
hired a top PR firm?

00:11:44.527 --> 00:11:45.735
LORD JOHN BROWNE: I did both.

00:11:45.735 --> 00:11:46.540
ARJAN DIJIK: Oh, you did both?

00:11:46.540 --> 00:11:47.075
OK.

00:11:47.075 --> 00:11:49.210
It's not in your book.

00:11:49.210 --> 00:11:52.450
LORD JOHN BROWNE: Well,
so I hired a top law firm.

00:11:52.450 --> 00:11:56.140
In 2006, it was all
the rage to have--

00:11:56.140 --> 00:11:58.760
all the rage-- it was
fashionable, I think,

00:11:58.760 --> 00:12:01.340
for a lot of people to
have these so-called super

00:12:01.340 --> 00:12:06.550
injunctions in the UK, which
you could stop people publishing

00:12:06.550 --> 00:12:09.450
things which violated
your privacy.

00:12:09.450 --> 00:12:10.900
Of course, the
"Daily Mail" group

00:12:10.900 --> 00:12:13.830
argued that I
didn't have privacy,

00:12:13.830 --> 00:12:16.915
because I was a public
figure, and therefore, it

00:12:16.915 --> 00:12:21.670
was a matter of public
policy and interest

00:12:21.670 --> 00:12:23.650
for them to know
everything about me.

00:12:23.650 --> 00:12:26.424
It's an interesting point
that when you get right

00:12:26.424 --> 00:12:28.090
on the top of a
company, you've probably

00:12:28.090 --> 00:12:32.180
abrogated your privacy,
anyway, in today's terms.

00:12:32.180 --> 00:12:34.750
But I fought this, and
I kept it bottled up.

00:12:34.750 --> 00:12:37.060
I couldn't tell anyone
about it, because if I

00:12:37.060 --> 00:12:40.720
told anyone what we were doing,
it was contempt of court.

00:12:40.720 --> 00:12:43.030
So for four months,
we were battling

00:12:43.030 --> 00:12:47.520
this case, which eventually
I lost on May the 1st.

00:12:47.520 --> 00:12:52.800
I got permission to hire a
top PR firm, which I did,

00:12:52.800 --> 00:12:56.070
to just maintain the storm.

00:12:56.070 --> 00:12:58.640
All they said to me was this.

00:12:58.640 --> 00:13:00.740
"There's not a lot we can do.

00:13:00.740 --> 00:13:02.340
This is going to be terrible.

00:13:02.340 --> 00:13:05.130
You just need to
toughen up your skin,

00:13:05.130 --> 00:13:08.510
and you need to get used to it."

00:13:08.510 --> 00:13:10.260
ARJAN DIJIK: I like
the quote in your book

00:13:10.260 --> 00:13:11.350
was, "You know, when
the caravans move--"

00:13:11.350 --> 00:13:12.090
LORD JOHN BROWNE: That
was another friend

00:13:12.090 --> 00:13:14.880
of mine, a great, great
politician friend of mine who'd

00:13:14.880 --> 00:13:19.441
been beaten up no end of times
used this quote from Joseph

00:13:19.441 --> 00:13:19.940
Needham.

00:13:19.940 --> 00:13:24.550
He's a great scientist,
sinologist, who said,

00:13:24.550 --> 00:13:28.720
"When the--" so to finish
things off-- "the dogs bark,

00:13:28.720 --> 00:13:31.110
and the caravan moves on."

00:13:31.110 --> 00:13:32.250
It's absolutely true.

00:13:32.250 --> 00:13:35.660
The dogs do bark, and
then the caravan moves on.

00:13:35.660 --> 00:13:38.820
So I left BP on May the 1st.

00:13:38.820 --> 00:13:39.550
It was May Day.

00:13:39.550 --> 00:13:41.890
I thought that was
quite important.

00:13:41.890 --> 00:13:46.820
And I decided that-- rather,
all the security people said,

00:13:46.820 --> 00:13:49.770
you really need to leave the
building by the back entrance.

00:13:49.770 --> 00:13:52.790
There were all sorts of
different escape entrances

00:13:52.790 --> 00:13:54.694
from BP headquarters,
because there

00:13:54.694 --> 00:13:56.610
were quite a lot of
protests from time to time

00:13:56.610 --> 00:13:58.711
about the oil industry.

00:13:58.711 --> 00:14:00.086
But I said, no,
I think I'm going

00:14:00.086 --> 00:14:02.080
to walk through the front door.

00:14:02.080 --> 00:14:05.740
Because I felt to myself
that I had rights, too.

00:14:05.740 --> 00:14:08.020
So I walked through
the front door,

00:14:08.020 --> 00:14:10.970
and I met the world's
press, and they

00:14:10.970 --> 00:14:15.620
became my constant
companions for three days.

00:14:15.620 --> 00:14:20.470
And people on motorbikes chasing
me with long telephoto lenses.

00:14:20.470 --> 00:14:23.380
And after that,
they left me alone.

00:14:23.380 --> 00:14:27.350
And so I just decided I
had to just redo my life.

00:14:27.350 --> 00:14:29.454
So I did.

00:14:29.454 --> 00:14:30.420
ARJAN DIJIK: Great.

00:14:30.420 --> 00:14:34.120
So maybe one more
question about the book.

00:14:34.120 --> 00:14:36.437
Are you happy with what
it has achieved so far?

00:14:36.437 --> 00:14:38.270
LORD JOHN BROWNE: So
the purpose of the book

00:14:38.270 --> 00:14:40.550
is to do what I said
at the beginning.

00:14:40.550 --> 00:14:42.390
But in the end, it's not a book.

00:14:42.390 --> 00:14:46.540
I want to maintain momentum for
great positive change that's

00:14:46.540 --> 00:14:49.700
taking place that
is probably not,

00:14:49.700 --> 00:14:54.800
I think, other than limited
and very important parts of it,

00:14:54.800 --> 00:14:57.180
very limited areas,
there's still

00:14:57.180 --> 00:14:59.100
a lot to do in the
corporate sector

00:14:59.100 --> 00:15:02.910
to get people to feel
comfortable to be themselves.

00:15:02.910 --> 00:15:05.260
And I say this by
the number of people

00:15:05.260 --> 00:15:07.797
I've spoken to much
more of your age

00:15:07.797 --> 00:15:14.800
than mine who have still
chosen, for reasons of concern,

00:15:14.800 --> 00:15:19.740
to stay in the closet at work
but be out in private life.

00:15:19.740 --> 00:15:24.860
And so I think I just observed
that this was going on.

00:15:24.860 --> 00:15:28.385
And I felt also that
at the senior levels,

00:15:28.385 --> 00:15:35.870
I noticed how the progress
of women in business

00:15:35.870 --> 00:15:38.910
always had promise, and
never quite achieved

00:15:38.910 --> 00:15:43.880
what it was expected to do.

00:15:43.880 --> 00:15:46.570
I can speak very clearly
about the UK, where,

00:15:46.570 --> 00:15:49.760
for example, there's been a big
push to put women on boards.

00:15:49.760 --> 00:15:53.860
So there's 20% women as
non-executives on boards.

00:15:53.860 --> 00:15:55.684
That's nice to have.

00:15:55.684 --> 00:15:57.100
But the real
question is, how many

00:15:57.100 --> 00:15:59.670
women on executive and
management committees

00:15:59.670 --> 00:16:00.650
are there?

00:16:00.650 --> 00:16:02.900
And the answer is only 6%
of management committees

00:16:02.900 --> 00:16:03.770
are women.

00:16:03.770 --> 00:16:06.960
So I said, if after
all that effort,

00:16:06.960 --> 00:16:08.460
this is what we
achieved with women,

00:16:08.460 --> 00:16:11.475
I think we've got to work
very hard to achieve something

00:16:11.475 --> 00:16:15.490
with LGBT people.

00:16:15.490 --> 00:16:18.160
And so the purpose of
the book's a movement,

00:16:18.160 --> 00:16:21.150
and I'm happy that that's
beginning, you might say.

00:16:21.150 --> 00:16:23.280
Sales of the book are
fine and all that stuff,

00:16:23.280 --> 00:16:25.390
but that's not the
point, I'd say.

00:16:25.390 --> 00:16:29.304
The point is what the book talks
about, not the book itself.

00:16:29.304 --> 00:16:30.720
ARJAN DIJIK: And
in your book, you

00:16:30.720 --> 00:16:35.730
quoted 41% of LGBT
executives in the USA

00:16:35.730 --> 00:16:38.170
decide to stay in the
closet, and 34% in the UK.

00:16:38.170 --> 00:16:39.128
LORD JOHN BROWNE: Yeah.

00:16:39.128 --> 00:16:42.299
ARJAN DIJIK: So the US
a bit worse than the UK.

00:16:42.299 --> 00:16:43.840
Why do you think
it's still the case?

00:16:43.840 --> 00:16:47.490
Because especially also
in the US, in most states,

00:16:47.490 --> 00:16:49.224
you know-- I think there's some.

00:16:49.224 --> 00:16:51.140
I'm not American, so I
will say stupid things.

00:16:51.140 --> 00:16:54.190
But in most states, you
cannot be fired, you cannot--

00:16:54.190 --> 00:16:55.140
what do you think?

00:16:55.140 --> 00:16:56.030
Do you think that--

00:16:56.030 --> 00:16:58.238
LORD JOHN BROWNE: I think
there's a very long shadow,

00:16:58.238 --> 00:17:03.130
and I do think that-- I say to
people in London, here we are.

00:17:03.130 --> 00:17:05.915
We're sitting in Chelsea
and Mayfair in London.

00:17:05.915 --> 00:17:10.000
We sit in Shoreditch
and Notting Hill,

00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:12.085
and everything looks fantastic.

00:17:12.085 --> 00:17:16.089
I said, you want to travel
50 miles north out of London

00:17:16.089 --> 00:17:18.000
and ask the question again?

00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:19.500
It's very different.

00:17:19.500 --> 00:17:20.609
I suggest the same here.

00:17:20.609 --> 00:17:27.459
You want to travel east from
this place, 50, 100 miles,

00:17:27.459 --> 00:17:29.590
it could be different.

00:17:29.590 --> 00:17:32.510
You want to go to-- I mean,
I've worked all over the States.

00:17:32.510 --> 00:17:35.970
I've worked in some really
exciting places like Cleveland,

00:17:35.970 --> 00:17:38.880
Ohio, which I liked, actually.

00:17:41.510 --> 00:17:43.910
But around Cleveland,
it's going to be

00:17:43.910 --> 00:17:48.350
more difficult to be yourself
than it is in New York City

00:17:48.350 --> 00:17:56.090
or in Mountain View or in
San Francisco or in Paris.

00:17:56.090 --> 00:17:59.000
It'll be much more
difficult in Rome.

00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:01.220
So there's a lot
of inconsistency,

00:18:01.220 --> 00:18:03.800
and it's very easy for all of
us, I think, to think, right,

00:18:03.800 --> 00:18:04.880
we're done.

00:18:04.880 --> 00:18:08.880
Because I look around my 100
yards around me, and everyone's

00:18:08.880 --> 00:18:09.487
fine.

00:18:09.487 --> 00:18:11.070
But actually, the
world is much bigger

00:18:11.070 --> 00:18:17.360
when you go outside
the US and Europe.

00:18:17.360 --> 00:18:19.770
You really do see
some big issues.

00:18:19.770 --> 00:18:24.720
In 77 countries, still,
it's a criminal act

00:18:24.720 --> 00:18:28.000
to either promote or to
undertake homosexual acts.

00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:31.790
In five of the countries,
it's the death penalty.

00:18:31.790 --> 00:18:33.680
And it's not actually
getting better.

00:18:33.680 --> 00:18:34.694
It's getting worse.

00:18:34.694 --> 00:18:36.360
ARJAN DIJIK: And maybe
talking about it,

00:18:36.360 --> 00:18:37.740
a lot of us who
have [? fret at ?]

00:18:37.740 --> 00:18:39.573
the [? economy, ?] I
think of two weeks ago,

00:18:39.573 --> 00:18:41.760
we talked about kind of
the extreme gay divide.

00:18:41.760 --> 00:18:44.850
And it talked
about, more or less,

00:18:44.850 --> 00:18:47.570
people going from
very tolerant, nice,

00:18:47.570 --> 00:18:51.230
to kind of extremely
conservative.

00:18:51.230 --> 00:18:54.450
Russia, Middle East, and then
you see, especially in the US,

00:18:54.450 --> 00:18:57.087
for example, gay
marriage has really--

00:18:57.087 --> 00:18:58.420
LORD JOHN BROWNE: Is taking off.

00:18:58.420 --> 00:19:00.140
ARJAN DIJIK: Beyond belief.

00:19:00.140 --> 00:19:03.100
Everybody could not
have hoped for more.

00:19:03.100 --> 00:19:05.570
What can we do about
this, do you think?

00:19:05.570 --> 00:19:07.820
As we work in Google.

00:19:07.820 --> 00:19:10.250
LORD JOHN BROWNE: Well,
you can't change-- I mean,

00:19:10.250 --> 00:19:15.369
no corporation can get anyone
to change the law, really,

00:19:15.369 --> 00:19:16.910
certainly outside
their home country.

00:19:16.910 --> 00:19:19.080
And there they can
lobby, but it's usually

00:19:19.080 --> 00:19:21.220
for business purposes.

00:19:21.220 --> 00:19:24.430
I believe there is a business
purpose to LGBT inclusion.

00:19:24.430 --> 00:19:27.020
It improves productivity,
apart from being

00:19:27.020 --> 00:19:29.810
right on a values basis.

00:19:29.810 --> 00:19:32.950
But I think what
you can do is you

00:19:32.950 --> 00:19:38.650
can apply an economic nudge--
a big economic nudge, which

00:19:38.650 --> 00:19:41.800
I think has worked, in
my own direct experience,

00:19:41.800 --> 00:19:47.560
in environmental matters,
in transparency, payments

00:19:47.560 --> 00:19:51.685
to governments, transparency,
in certain other human rights.

00:19:51.685 --> 00:19:55.120
So CEOs can apply a
nudge to get change.

00:19:55.120 --> 00:19:58.530
And interestingly, the most
important thing, I think,

00:19:58.530 --> 00:20:02.170
is to, when you have
expatriate [INAUDIBLE] people,

00:20:02.170 --> 00:20:07.130
to send out gay people
to a place like Uganda

00:20:07.130 --> 00:20:10.780
as the CEO of a local
branch of Company

00:20:10.780 --> 00:20:14.020
X. As long as they
don't break the law,

00:20:14.020 --> 00:20:16.520
it's an amazing
signal, I believe.

00:20:16.520 --> 00:20:20.270
And it's a signal of
equality, of real inclusion,

00:20:20.270 --> 00:20:27.330
and I think a point being made
which is not for that purpose

00:20:27.330 --> 00:20:30.130
alone-- because it's
about the company--

00:20:30.130 --> 00:20:33.810
but it makes a point that a
company has a variety of people

00:20:33.810 --> 00:20:36.080
doing great things
of great merit,

00:20:36.080 --> 00:20:39.670
regardless of their background,
regardless of their sexuality.

00:20:39.670 --> 00:20:40.420
ARJAN DIJIK: Yeah.

00:20:40.420 --> 00:20:40.920
Great.

00:20:40.920 --> 00:20:45.490
So I think maybe it's
time to go to Q&amp;A. Medea

00:20:45.490 --> 00:20:51.134
has the microphone, so if you
have a question, don't be shy.

00:20:51.134 --> 00:20:53.300
AUDIENCE: My question is
if you have a point of view

00:20:53.300 --> 00:20:56.147
on how well Silicon Valley
and the tech industry does.

00:20:56.147 --> 00:20:57.563
In this space, I
think [INAUDIBLE]

00:20:57.563 --> 00:21:01.250
is that tech is rather inclusive
compared to other industries.

00:21:01.250 --> 00:21:03.340
But do you think we're
all the way there,

00:21:03.340 --> 00:21:05.224
or is there more
of a ways to go?

00:21:05.224 --> 00:21:06.890
LORD JOHN BROWNE: I
don't have, I think,

00:21:06.890 --> 00:21:10.960
a knowledgeable analysis.

00:21:10.960 --> 00:21:12.990
What I do observe,
though, is a lot

00:21:12.990 --> 00:21:15.440
of statements about
the difficulties

00:21:15.440 --> 00:21:21.350
in some parts of Silicon Valley,
including San Francisco, where

00:21:21.350 --> 00:21:27.110
some companies have become more
frat house style companies.

00:21:27.110 --> 00:21:31.530
And this has been bad for
all forms of inclusion, LGBT

00:21:31.530 --> 00:21:36.080
being no exception,
women being no exception.

00:21:36.080 --> 00:21:39.645
So I think, like
any organization,

00:21:39.645 --> 00:21:43.635
you have to be very careful
to maintain a clear-eyed view

00:21:43.635 --> 00:21:47.530
on inclusion, which means
that people don't get put

00:21:47.530 --> 00:21:51.280
into a position of being
excluded inadvertently

00:21:51.280 --> 00:21:53.895
or-- inadvertently, actually,
[? where ?] discrimination

00:21:53.895 --> 00:21:55.510
is rare.

00:21:55.510 --> 00:21:59.340
But inadvertent exclusion
by team activity

00:21:59.340 --> 00:22:03.400
that doesn't allow
people to be themselves.

00:22:03.400 --> 00:22:06.000
And I think that you have to
be very careful about that,

00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:09.570
because enthusiasm can
take you to a place which

00:22:09.570 --> 00:22:11.830
is negative as
opposed to positive.

00:22:11.830 --> 00:22:15.217
So I see that as probably
the biggest danger.

00:22:15.217 --> 00:22:16.800
AUDIENCE: So then,
just as a followup,

00:22:16.800 --> 00:22:20.430
so you think the remedy, at
least on a micro level scale,

00:22:20.430 --> 00:22:24.050
is to just be mindful of how
your team engages with one

00:22:24.050 --> 00:22:24.814
another?

00:22:24.814 --> 00:22:25.980
LORD JOHN BROWNE: Generally.

00:22:25.980 --> 00:22:28.340
I mean, I think, you
know, the formula

00:22:28.340 --> 00:22:29.850
is a very
straightforward formula

00:22:29.850 --> 00:22:32.450
about getting almost
anything done in business.

00:22:32.450 --> 00:22:36.240
The leader has to say,
I want it to happen.

00:22:36.240 --> 00:22:39.280
Secondly, managers
have to spend time

00:22:39.280 --> 00:22:43.690
making it happen, which means
they've got to be encouraged,

00:22:43.690 --> 00:22:47.000
directed, or incentivized
to put time on their agenda,

00:22:47.000 --> 00:22:51.550
to talk to people and figure
out how to include people.

00:22:51.550 --> 00:22:56.470
What to do to make it safe for
LGBT people to be themselves.

00:22:56.470 --> 00:23:01.140
What to do to make sure that
men can interact with women

00:23:01.140 --> 00:23:03.220
in a way which makes sense.

00:23:03.220 --> 00:23:08.500
So time, and then measuring
that through surveys,

00:23:08.500 --> 00:23:13.141
and then making sure that
you have the role models.

00:23:13.141 --> 00:23:14.140
We've talked about that.

00:23:14.140 --> 00:23:17.140
So signals from the top,
measurement, role models.

00:23:17.140 --> 00:23:21.980
And finally, making sure that
inclusion means inclusion.

00:23:21.980 --> 00:23:25.730
So it doesn't mean having
LGBT networks and saying,

00:23:25.730 --> 00:23:26.660
well, we've got those.

00:23:26.660 --> 00:23:27.560
That's great.

00:23:27.560 --> 00:23:28.570
Tick.

00:23:28.570 --> 00:23:33.500
Actually, it's about including
straight allies and everybody

00:23:33.500 --> 00:23:35.230
in bigger networks.

00:23:35.230 --> 00:23:37.630
The danger is simply
satisfying yourself

00:23:37.630 --> 00:23:40.360
that you've done something
important by getting

00:23:40.360 --> 00:23:42.960
all the people who are
just the same as each other

00:23:42.960 --> 00:23:47.270
talking to each other,
and keeping it sealed up.

00:23:47.270 --> 00:23:48.590
That's not right.

00:23:48.590 --> 00:23:49.369
That's not right.

00:23:49.369 --> 00:23:51.660
AUDIENCE: First of all, just
thank you for your candor.

00:23:51.660 --> 00:23:53.369
It's been a really
wonderful talk so far.

00:23:53.369 --> 00:23:54.535
LORD JOHN BROWNE: Thank you.

00:23:54.535 --> 00:23:56.640
AUDIENCE: So I'm wondering
when you were still

00:23:56.640 --> 00:23:59.500
heading up BP, did you
ever consider coming out?

00:23:59.500 --> 00:24:02.620
Or was that just
never a possibility?

00:24:02.620 --> 00:24:04.900
LORD JOHN BROWNE: You know,
I never thought about it,

00:24:04.900 --> 00:24:07.880
because I'd so-- you
have to remember,

00:24:07.880 --> 00:24:10.560
I'd been in the closet,
I suppose-- well,

00:24:10.560 --> 00:24:13.300
I was 59 when I was outed.

00:24:13.300 --> 00:24:15.580
So pick the date when I started.

00:24:15.580 --> 00:24:17.320
13, let's say?

00:24:17.320 --> 00:24:20.110
So that was a grand
total of 45 years.

00:24:20.110 --> 00:24:22.840
By that time, I really
had persuaded myself

00:24:22.840 --> 00:24:25.840
that my arguments
about not coming out

00:24:25.840 --> 00:24:28.080
were absolutely perfect.

00:24:28.080 --> 00:24:31.070
There was no question
that they were wrong.

00:24:31.070 --> 00:24:34.330
Because after 45 years
of talking to yourself

00:24:34.330 --> 00:24:36.555
about a topic, you're
bound to be right.

00:24:36.555 --> 00:24:39.835
I mean, who is to
disagree with you?

00:24:39.835 --> 00:24:42.360
So I'm trivializing it.

00:24:42.360 --> 00:24:44.250
But these were
firmly held beliefs,

00:24:44.250 --> 00:24:46.560
so it didn't even cross my mind.

00:24:46.560 --> 00:24:51.180
Strangely, like everybody
in the position that I held,

00:24:51.180 --> 00:24:54.320
when I go and talk
about my book and what

00:24:54.320 --> 00:24:59.370
I believe is right to get
this movement moving right

00:24:59.370 --> 00:25:01.910
across the world,
people say to me,

00:25:01.910 --> 00:25:05.130
well, John, we
knew you were gay.

00:25:05.130 --> 00:25:10.870
It's just that we felt that you
didn't want to hear from us,

00:25:10.870 --> 00:25:12.840
and we kind of respected that.

00:25:12.840 --> 00:25:15.320
So everybody knew I
was gay, apparently.

00:25:15.320 --> 00:25:18.230
I mean, even in other
companies outside BP,

00:25:18.230 --> 00:25:19.590
in the oil and gas sector.

00:25:19.590 --> 00:25:23.365
A guy got up in--
I was presenting

00:25:23.365 --> 00:25:27.960
at a literary festival,
Cheltenham Literary Festival.

00:25:27.960 --> 00:25:29.800
And he got up and
said, well, you know,

00:25:29.800 --> 00:25:31.550
we all knew you were
gay, but we just

00:25:31.550 --> 00:25:34.370
couldn't bring ourselves
to say it to you.

00:25:34.370 --> 00:25:37.450
And we just felt
it was very tragic

00:25:37.450 --> 00:25:41.010
that you didn't know that.

00:25:41.010 --> 00:25:42.410
But that happens.

00:25:42.410 --> 00:25:44.380
It happens a lot.

00:25:44.380 --> 00:25:47.610
It happens a lot.

00:25:47.610 --> 00:25:50.250
People guard
themselves for safety.

00:25:50.250 --> 00:25:54.650
No one ever does something, I
mean, really recklessly unsafe.

00:25:54.650 --> 00:25:58.558
And I thought that was
recklessly unsafe, to come out.

00:26:02.370 --> 00:26:04.820
If I can add, it will
be very interesting

00:26:04.820 --> 00:26:09.690
and why I think Tim Cook
coming out is very important.

00:26:09.690 --> 00:26:11.905
Again, a lot of people
said they knew he

00:26:11.905 --> 00:26:13.895
was gay, been a lot of chatter.

00:26:13.895 --> 00:26:15.270
But there's a very
big difference

00:26:15.270 --> 00:26:19.220
if you're a leader to
actually come out and say,

00:26:19.220 --> 00:26:23.380
I'm gay, and then elaborate.

00:26:23.380 --> 00:26:26.900
And he, therefore, had
there been someone like him

00:26:26.900 --> 00:26:31.450
around while I was CEO of
BP, or maybe another CEO

00:26:31.450 --> 00:26:35.060
of a big company, I
might have said, hmm.

00:26:35.060 --> 00:26:38.250
Well, if he can do it, so can
I. And it would have given me

00:26:38.250 --> 00:26:39.970
a lot of confidence.

00:26:39.970 --> 00:26:42.220
I might not have done it,
but it would have given me

00:26:42.220 --> 00:26:45.070
much more confidence.

00:26:45.070 --> 00:26:47.320
ARJAN DIJIK: And maybe,
for me to chip in, why do

00:26:47.320 --> 00:26:49.457
you think it took him so long?

00:26:49.457 --> 00:26:50.290
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:26:53.359 --> 00:26:55.150
LORD JOHN BROWNE: Coming
out is a process--

00:26:55.150 --> 00:27:01.425
a unique process-- and everyone
has all kinds of barriers

00:27:01.425 --> 00:27:03.960
or demons they've got to kill.

00:27:03.960 --> 00:27:06.080
Barriers they've
got to overcome.

00:27:06.080 --> 00:27:08.990
And actually, I've
noticed that one or two

00:27:08.990 --> 00:27:12.760
CEOs of smaller companies who
are out before they become

00:27:12.760 --> 00:27:15.860
a CEO, always kind of
go back into the closet

00:27:15.860 --> 00:27:18.300
for a little while,
while they're a CEO,

00:27:18.300 --> 00:27:20.000
and then come out again.

00:27:20.000 --> 00:27:24.010
And it's because
the change of status

00:27:24.010 --> 00:27:29.280
makes them feel that
they need to express

00:27:29.280 --> 00:27:31.480
different priorities.

00:27:31.480 --> 00:27:33.770
So I think everyone does that.

00:27:33.770 --> 00:27:37.250
I've been very struck
by a lot of people,

00:27:37.250 --> 00:27:39.810
younger people who work
with me, they always say,

00:27:39.810 --> 00:27:41.480
well, we're gay.

00:27:41.480 --> 00:27:43.950
And they say, well,
John, it's fine for you.

00:27:43.950 --> 00:27:48.140
Everyone knows you're gay now.

00:27:48.140 --> 00:27:51.200
We, on the other hand,
every time I change a job,

00:27:51.200 --> 00:27:52.650
I have to come out.

00:27:52.650 --> 00:27:54.380
And it's exhausting.

00:27:54.380 --> 00:27:56.310
They say it's
absolutely exhausting.

00:27:56.310 --> 00:27:58.420
So we need to figure
out how to make

00:27:58.420 --> 00:28:00.502
coming out not as important.

00:28:00.502 --> 00:28:01.460
ARJAN DIJIK: I'm sorry.

00:28:01.460 --> 00:28:04.430
I know there are more
questions, but, so, what

00:28:04.430 --> 00:28:05.660
is the advice you would give?

00:28:05.660 --> 00:28:09.424
So how do you do that?

00:28:09.424 --> 00:28:11.590
What would you advise to
someone who's in the closet

00:28:11.590 --> 00:28:15.460
and is struggling to get out,
based on how you look at it?

00:28:15.460 --> 00:28:17.480
LORD JOHN BROWNE: Well,
from my own experience,

00:28:17.480 --> 00:28:19.490
if I replay it all,
I'd say, first,

00:28:19.490 --> 00:28:22.780
don't invest too much
time building two lives.

00:28:22.780 --> 00:28:25.060
Because it is
negative investment,

00:28:25.060 --> 00:28:28.999
and actually, it's difficult
to-- literally like

00:28:28.999 --> 00:28:31.040
an investment-- it's very
difficult to write off,

00:28:31.040 --> 00:28:31.950
as it were.

00:28:34.680 --> 00:28:37.360
The more you build the edifice,
the more it's with you.

00:28:37.360 --> 00:28:40.910
So the sooner you can come
out, the better, I think.

00:28:40.910 --> 00:28:43.250
Secondly, but don't
do it recklessly.

00:28:43.250 --> 00:28:47.510
You've got to be with an
employer who's made it safe

00:28:47.510 --> 00:28:48.880
for you to do that.

00:28:48.880 --> 00:28:52.790
Sending out the right signals,
the right encouragement,

00:28:52.790 --> 00:28:54.790
the right networks.

00:28:54.790 --> 00:28:58.600
Not just gay networks, but
gay and straight networks.

00:28:58.600 --> 00:29:00.710
But you can't do it recklessly.

00:29:00.710 --> 00:29:03.350
No one can be expected
to do it recklessly.

00:29:03.350 --> 00:29:05.087
But I think there
are increasingly

00:29:05.087 --> 00:29:06.170
employers who can do that.

00:29:06.170 --> 00:29:07.880
And I'd go further
and say, actually,

00:29:07.880 --> 00:29:09.870
if you find it
intolerable, leave

00:29:09.870 --> 00:29:13.870
and find another employer
that will let you do this.

00:29:13.870 --> 00:29:17.600
And I'm very struck
that-- and again, I've

00:29:17.600 --> 00:29:24.420
interviewed people who were very
intrigued with what companies

00:29:24.420 --> 00:29:28.610
were saying about LGBT inclusion
at these recruitment fairs.

00:29:28.610 --> 00:29:31.570
And many of them
were straight women.

00:29:31.570 --> 00:29:37.610
And they said, we go around
talking to the LGBT recruiters,

00:29:37.610 --> 00:29:40.390
because we figured out that
if they get this right,

00:29:40.390 --> 00:29:42.990
they probably get gender right.

00:29:42.990 --> 00:29:46.930
So, leading indicator,
lagging indicator.

00:29:46.930 --> 00:29:51.290
AUDIENCE: So the oil industry
has a lot of aspects of it

00:29:51.290 --> 00:29:52.706
in the companies
where they can be

00:29:52.706 --> 00:29:55.790
kind of an all boys
culture, very conservative.

00:29:55.790 --> 00:29:59.250
What advice would you
give to someone struggling

00:29:59.250 --> 00:30:01.510
with the decision to come
out in that industry,

00:30:01.510 --> 00:30:05.540
and also to someone who
wants to be an ally working

00:30:05.540 --> 00:30:06.610
in that culture?

00:30:06.610 --> 00:30:09.110
LORD JOHN BROWNE:
So I think one thing

00:30:09.110 --> 00:30:13.240
I did when I came out in a
rather spectacular way-- I was

00:30:13.240 --> 00:30:17.390
out in a spectacular
way-- was to change

00:30:17.390 --> 00:30:19.510
some mindsets somewhere.

00:30:19.510 --> 00:30:22.210
So my old company,
BP, for example,

00:30:22.210 --> 00:30:25.570
is doing very well in this area.

00:30:25.570 --> 00:30:27.170
They're very concerned.

00:30:27.170 --> 00:30:30.510
They're very, very
concerned about making sure

00:30:30.510 --> 00:30:35.490
that LGBT inclusion is
deeply in the agenda.

00:30:35.490 --> 00:30:37.500
And they've done it very well.

00:30:37.500 --> 00:30:40.575
Two members of the executive
management committee

00:30:40.575 --> 00:30:41.630
are out gay people.

00:30:41.630 --> 00:30:43.860
Their global head of
HR and the global head

00:30:43.860 --> 00:30:46.800
of supply trading,
which is the place where

00:30:46.800 --> 00:30:50.050
90% of the revenue
of BP is generated.

00:30:50.050 --> 00:30:52.260
So it's not exactly a small job.

00:30:52.260 --> 00:30:55.630
So this is great.

00:30:55.630 --> 00:30:58.890
And they will say,
well, we went back

00:30:58.890 --> 00:31:01.500
and thought about what
on Earth was going on,

00:31:01.500 --> 00:31:04.040
and they did something about it.

00:31:04.040 --> 00:31:05.827
So I think more
and more people are

00:31:05.827 --> 00:31:07.993
feeling comfortable to come
out in that environment.

00:31:07.993 --> 00:31:12.100
They're very concerned
about making sure

00:31:12.100 --> 00:31:15.330
that it's not a
barrier to most people,

00:31:15.330 --> 00:31:17.272
or send people to Russia, or--

00:31:17.272 --> 00:31:19.730
You know, there are plenty of
places the oil industry works

00:31:19.730 --> 00:31:24.240
which is where a lot of
other companies don't.

00:31:24.240 --> 00:31:27.820
West Africa, lots of
places, the Middle East.

00:31:27.820 --> 00:31:29.720
And they're doing that.

00:31:29.720 --> 00:31:32.170
They're absolutely doing that.

00:31:32.170 --> 00:31:34.275
So I think there are
one or two companies.

00:31:34.275 --> 00:31:35.525
And there are other companies.

00:31:35.525 --> 00:31:41.310
I mean, it's well known that,
I think, on the HRC Index,

00:31:41.310 --> 00:31:44.610
Exxon is the only company
that, for three years,

00:31:44.610 --> 00:31:47.440
has had a negative score.

00:31:47.440 --> 00:31:49.610
So it's made of extremes.

00:31:49.610 --> 00:31:51.140
It's made of extremes.

00:31:51.140 --> 00:31:54.850
I think gone are the days--
when I joined the oil industry,

00:31:54.850 --> 00:31:58.920
there were hardly any
women in the oil industry.

00:31:58.920 --> 00:32:03.000
There was an event, I remember,
even in the United States,

00:32:03.000 --> 00:32:04.660
where I worked.

00:32:04.660 --> 00:32:08.150
The event was having a
woman engineer arrive,

00:32:08.150 --> 00:32:15.550
and having to find a space
to make a women's lavatory.

00:32:15.550 --> 00:32:18.300
But things have changed a lot.

00:32:18.300 --> 00:32:23.790
So I think that that sort of--
how I managed to tolerate it,

00:32:23.790 --> 00:32:26.240
I'm not quite sure, but you
just get used to things.

00:32:26.240 --> 00:32:30.960
But it's an overly exclusive
good old boys' network

00:32:30.960 --> 00:32:34.320
for this, I think, in these
big companies, has changed.

00:32:34.320 --> 00:32:36.240
In small companies, I
still think it's just

00:32:36.240 --> 00:32:38.190
like that in the oil industry.

00:32:38.190 --> 00:32:40.990
ARJAN DIJIK: And
maybe related to that

00:32:40.990 --> 00:32:43.120
is that a little
anecdote from Google.

00:32:43.120 --> 00:32:46.140
A very senior colleague
of mine, female,

00:32:46.140 --> 00:32:51.100
is in Hollywood-- a big
studio, a big meeting-- there's

00:32:51.100 --> 00:32:54.960
a big Hollywood film boss.

00:32:54.960 --> 00:32:57.700
There are guys,
there are some women.

00:32:57.700 --> 00:33:01.170
And then he says to her, hey,
honey, pour me some coffee.

00:33:01.170 --> 00:33:07.390
So imagine, if that
happens, what do you do?

00:33:07.390 --> 00:33:09.920
Because I don't think that
blatant discrimination

00:33:09.920 --> 00:33:11.060
is the issue.

00:33:11.060 --> 00:33:15.240
It's always the kind of stuff
that you say, do I now really--

00:33:15.240 --> 00:33:17.470
but you're in a kind
of partner meeting.

00:33:17.470 --> 00:33:19.550
This is not within the company.

00:33:19.550 --> 00:33:22.700
So there is clearly some
business to be done.

00:33:22.700 --> 00:33:24.945
How principled-- how
would you deal with that?

00:33:24.945 --> 00:33:27.320
LORD JOHN BROWNE: I think you
need to be very principled.

00:33:27.320 --> 00:33:30.240
Because people observe you.

00:33:30.240 --> 00:33:33.190
You always observe behavior
in the more difficult

00:33:33.190 --> 00:33:34.120
circumstances.

00:33:34.120 --> 00:33:38.800
It's easy to be perfect
when there are no issues.

00:33:38.800 --> 00:33:42.460
It's tough to be even
half perfect when

00:33:42.460 --> 00:33:44.722
there are big challenges.

00:33:44.722 --> 00:33:45.930
It doesn't matter what it is.

00:33:45.930 --> 00:33:48.500
They always test you
and they observe.

00:33:48.500 --> 00:33:49.000
They watch.

00:33:49.000 --> 00:33:51.760
So if you say to
people, I really

00:33:51.760 --> 00:33:54.190
want to be an
inclusive organization,

00:33:54.190 --> 00:33:57.540
and the first thing you do
is go out and be exclusive,

00:33:57.540 --> 00:34:00.660
then people say,
well, this is a joke.

00:34:00.660 --> 00:34:02.510
This is a joke.

00:34:02.510 --> 00:34:04.340
So you've got to be consistent.

00:34:04.340 --> 00:34:07.480
So I like the IBM
approach, which is,

00:34:07.480 --> 00:34:10.070
they say, look, people
behave like that,

00:34:10.070 --> 00:34:12.760
we don't want them with
suppliers or customers.

00:34:12.760 --> 00:34:14.580
And I believe
they're pretty close.

00:34:14.580 --> 00:34:16.510
And BP is the same.

00:34:16.510 --> 00:34:18.810
Now, they have to go
with their eyes open.

00:34:18.810 --> 00:34:23.250
You know, you go to
Abu Dhabi and Dubai,

00:34:23.250 --> 00:34:26.440
or go to [INAUDIBLE],
and you know

00:34:26.440 --> 00:34:28.150
the rules you're
undertaking, which

00:34:28.150 --> 00:34:33.550
is it's illegal there for people
to undertake homosexual acts,

00:34:33.550 --> 00:34:35.260
period.

00:34:35.260 --> 00:34:37.309
It's not illegal to be gay.

00:34:37.309 --> 00:34:39.330
It's different.

00:34:39.330 --> 00:34:43.350
And therefore, you can behave
correctly and appropriately,

00:34:43.350 --> 00:34:46.080
but you shouldn't take
any discrimination

00:34:46.080 --> 00:34:49.210
or any pejorative words.

00:34:49.210 --> 00:34:51.600
I mean, you occasionally
have to educate people.

00:34:51.600 --> 00:34:54.010
I was very struck in
my own private equity

00:34:54.010 --> 00:34:56.659
firm-- I'm a partner of
a private equity firm.

00:34:56.659 --> 00:35:03.740
We had this meeting of CEOs
of some of our portfolio

00:35:03.740 --> 00:35:07.740
companies, where they sold
half their company, or we

00:35:07.740 --> 00:35:09.740
[INAUDIBLE] out of some
[? of our ?] investment,

00:35:09.740 --> 00:35:12.890
and so they'd made quite a
lot of money, these people,

00:35:12.890 --> 00:35:14.320
correctly.

00:35:14.320 --> 00:35:17.606
And so there were a panel,
and one of my partners

00:35:17.606 --> 00:35:18.480
was chairing a panel.

00:35:18.480 --> 00:35:21.560
And they said, what's it
feel like when you go home

00:35:21.560 --> 00:35:25.080
and tell the wife that
you've made all this money?

00:35:25.080 --> 00:35:26.280
So I look at the audience.

00:35:26.280 --> 00:35:27.520
I'm sitting there.

00:35:27.520 --> 00:35:31.040
And first of all, the
number of limited partners,

00:35:31.040 --> 00:35:34.330
investors, represented
by women, not that many

00:35:34.330 --> 00:35:35.714
in private equity.

00:35:35.714 --> 00:35:36.505
But there are some.

00:35:36.505 --> 00:35:41.090
And I notice one or two of
them wince a little bit.

00:35:41.090 --> 00:35:43.740
But they're kind of used to
it in that sort of milieu,

00:35:43.740 --> 00:35:45.530
but inappropriate.

00:35:45.530 --> 00:35:47.405
So afterwards, I went
up to the guy and said,

00:35:47.405 --> 00:35:51.110
well, you know, I want you
to know that I'm not sure

00:35:51.110 --> 00:35:55.650
how my partner, who's a
man, would think about this.

00:35:55.650 --> 00:35:57.750
And he said, I got it.

00:35:57.750 --> 00:36:01.085
He said, I just-- I'm so sorry.

00:36:01.085 --> 00:36:04.180
No one had ever
told me about this.

00:36:04.180 --> 00:36:06.230
No one ever told me about it.

00:36:06.230 --> 00:36:10.740
And I think a lot of it is
a little bit of education.

00:36:10.740 --> 00:36:13.060
People are generally
pretty smart,

00:36:13.060 --> 00:36:16.060
and they've generally
got great common sense.

00:36:16.060 --> 00:36:18.570
And just a bit of
education to say,

00:36:18.570 --> 00:36:20.930
don't be politically correct.

00:36:20.930 --> 00:36:24.050
Just be commonsensical.

00:36:24.050 --> 00:36:26.850
Just use your common sense.

00:36:26.850 --> 00:36:29.665
And it goes a very
long way, I think.

00:36:29.665 --> 00:36:31.290
AUDIENCE: Research
shows that companies

00:36:31.290 --> 00:36:33.960
that are led by
diverse leadership

00:36:33.960 --> 00:36:36.632
perform better financially.

00:36:36.632 --> 00:36:37.840
But it's kind of [INAUDIBLE].

00:36:37.840 --> 00:36:39.280
It's kind of
unclear whether it's

00:36:39.280 --> 00:36:42.480
because it's like an indicator
of a good management team,

00:36:42.480 --> 00:36:46.560
or is it because people
are able to be themselves,

00:36:46.560 --> 00:36:48.256
more and more productive?

00:36:48.256 --> 00:36:50.130
So this is kind of
hypothetical, but have you

00:36:50.130 --> 00:36:53.420
thought about how it would have
been if you were out at BP?

00:36:53.420 --> 00:36:56.870
And can you address,
like, what are the reasons

00:36:56.870 --> 00:37:00.370
that these companies
perform better?

00:37:00.370 --> 00:37:03.830
LORD JOHN BROWNE: So there's
a lot of work in this area.

00:37:03.830 --> 00:37:08.715
Some of it's a little suspect,
because the data analysis

00:37:08.715 --> 00:37:09.430
is not there.

00:37:09.430 --> 00:37:11.930
But some of the
really good work is

00:37:11.930 --> 00:37:14.230
this-- that people
have simply divided

00:37:14.230 --> 00:37:18.620
their 20 years worth of staff
surveys, employee surveys.

00:37:18.620 --> 00:37:21.060
So they've gone around
and divided companies

00:37:21.060 --> 00:37:24.870
into those which have high
engagement scores against those

00:37:24.870 --> 00:37:26.640
who have low engagement scores.

00:37:26.640 --> 00:37:29.610
On these surveys,
they're consistent data.

00:37:29.610 --> 00:37:32.650
And they compared the financial
performance of these two data

00:37:32.650 --> 00:37:33.600
sets.

00:37:33.600 --> 00:37:37.030
Those with high
performance engagement

00:37:37.030 --> 00:37:40.260
consistently outperformed
those with low engagement

00:37:40.260 --> 00:37:44.240
by around about 2% a year
over a 20-year period.

00:37:44.240 --> 00:37:45.280
It's fantastic.

00:37:45.280 --> 00:37:47.960
Huge, huge outperformance.

00:37:47.960 --> 00:37:50.110
Huge outperformance.

00:37:50.110 --> 00:37:54.980
Now, engagement-- the most about
engagement is about inclusion.

00:37:54.980 --> 00:37:59.330
And if you get inclusion
right, then engagement follows.

00:37:59.330 --> 00:38:01.480
If-- and it's pretty
obvious, really,

00:38:01.480 --> 00:38:03.840
that if you don't have
people who are engaged,

00:38:03.840 --> 00:38:05.930
they're using their
mind for something else.

00:38:05.930 --> 00:38:09.390
Or in the reverse,
they're using their mind

00:38:09.390 --> 00:38:13.710
to be someone they're not, and
therefore they can't engage.

00:38:13.710 --> 00:38:18.200
So I think engagement
produces a very significant,

00:38:18.200 --> 00:38:22.660
and therefore, inclusion, of
all sorts, including LGBT,

00:38:22.660 --> 00:38:27.180
produce outsized
financial returns.

00:38:27.180 --> 00:38:28.810
There's a second
dimension, which

00:38:28.810 --> 00:38:34.140
is when you make a
decision, you really

00:38:34.140 --> 00:38:37.070
do want people to
come at a decision

00:38:37.070 --> 00:38:39.570
from different points of view.

00:38:39.570 --> 00:38:42.580
Otherwise, again, you're
persuading yourself

00:38:42.580 --> 00:38:47.330
that you're absolutely perfect,
and you know all the answers.

00:38:47.330 --> 00:38:49.970
And therein lies real danger.

00:38:49.970 --> 00:38:53.810
And that's where
corporations fail.

00:38:53.810 --> 00:38:58.910
So having diverse management
teams at all levels

00:38:58.910 --> 00:39:00.260
is really very important.

00:39:00.260 --> 00:39:03.750
That diversity is generated
many different ways,

00:39:03.750 --> 00:39:06.870
depending on the company
you're involved in.

00:39:06.870 --> 00:39:08.420
If you're in a
resource company, you

00:39:08.420 --> 00:39:11.580
want to make absolutely sure
you've got representative.

00:39:11.580 --> 00:39:13.980
You've understood
how you can include,

00:39:13.980 --> 00:39:16.370
for example, a simple
thing like people

00:39:16.370 --> 00:39:20.160
from the country in
which you're working.

00:39:20.160 --> 00:39:24.300
That was a novel
idea a long time ago.

00:39:24.300 --> 00:39:27.280
And if you're
marketing something,

00:39:27.280 --> 00:39:29.910
then surely you
want to understand

00:39:29.910 --> 00:39:32.240
the impact and the
understanding of people

00:39:32.240 --> 00:39:36.380
from different race backgrounds,
different sexualities,

00:39:36.380 --> 00:39:37.530
you name it.

00:39:37.530 --> 00:39:42.330
So I think there's lots of
different ways of creating

00:39:42.330 --> 00:39:45.260
diversity in decision making.

00:39:45.260 --> 00:39:47.720
But I come back saying
if you get LGBT inclusion

00:39:47.720 --> 00:39:51.430
right, chances you've got all
sorts of other inclusion right,

00:39:51.430 --> 00:39:54.680
because it's one of the more
difficult things to consider.

00:39:54.680 --> 00:39:57.040
Especially when
it requires-- you

00:39:57.040 --> 00:39:59.050
have to get inclusion
right in order

00:39:59.050 --> 00:40:02.390
to get people to self-disclose
that they're gay in order

00:40:02.390 --> 00:40:04.280
to get inclusion right.

00:40:04.280 --> 00:40:08.210
So if you think about it,
it's a multistage process,

00:40:08.210 --> 00:40:11.770
whereas other things are
a single stage process.

00:40:11.770 --> 00:40:12.270
Sorry.

00:40:12.270 --> 00:40:16.470
I'm an engineer, so I
need to [INAUDIBLE].

00:40:16.470 --> 00:40:18.525
AUDIENCE: I actually
have three questions.

00:40:21.590 --> 00:40:26.590
The first one being that if
you knew then all the things

00:40:26.590 --> 00:40:33.520
that you know now, would
you change your experience

00:40:33.520 --> 00:40:38.170
with resigning from BP?

00:40:38.170 --> 00:40:40.680
Would you have let everything
play out as it did,

00:40:40.680 --> 00:40:43.542
or would there have been things
that you would have changed?

00:40:43.542 --> 00:40:45.250
LORD JOHN BROWNE: So
I think at the time,

00:40:45.250 --> 00:40:48.390
it was very clear to me that
I had to resign from BP,

00:40:48.390 --> 00:40:52.770
because the circumstances
were unusual.

00:40:52.770 --> 00:40:55.500
I knew that the press
would go after me,

00:40:55.500 --> 00:40:59.520
and I didn't want
BP to suffer that.

00:40:59.520 --> 00:41:04.010
In particular, I'd invested a
lot of my life in this firm,

00:41:04.010 --> 00:41:09.510
and I just didn't want people
to be damaged in that way.

00:41:09.510 --> 00:41:14.155
So it was very clear to me that
this was my responsibility.

00:41:14.155 --> 00:41:18.120
And I had to get
control of my life.

00:41:18.120 --> 00:41:22.000
And the way to control
it is to take an action,

00:41:22.000 --> 00:41:24.510
and it was very clear
that the action was

00:41:24.510 --> 00:41:28.420
to resign, not
just from BP, but I

00:41:28.420 --> 00:41:31.880
tried to resign from
everything I was involved in.

00:41:31.880 --> 00:41:34.940
Some people simply
refused to accept it,

00:41:34.940 --> 00:41:39.100
because I thought we'd
just start again, really.

00:41:39.100 --> 00:41:41.070
Why not start again?

00:41:41.070 --> 00:41:45.010
And so I think the
decision was right.

00:41:45.010 --> 00:41:48.835
Today, I think I'd have to think
about it in the circumstances.

00:41:52.230 --> 00:41:57.120
In [INAUDIBLE],
my answers change

00:41:57.120 --> 00:41:59.760
as the information changes.

00:41:59.760 --> 00:42:05.720
So I think now it would
depend on the circumstances.

00:42:05.720 --> 00:42:08.070
But I think it would
be easier, probably,

00:42:08.070 --> 00:42:10.110
to say, well, I'll
just fight it.

00:42:10.110 --> 00:42:13.090
I'll just carry on.

00:42:13.090 --> 00:42:18.220
I think when every year goes
by, I think it will get easier.

00:42:18.220 --> 00:42:21.780
AUDIENCE: And since
leaving BP, have you ever

00:42:21.780 --> 00:42:24.280
been brought back
in as a consultant?

00:42:24.280 --> 00:42:28.930
And if so, have
there been any advice

00:42:28.930 --> 00:42:31.531
that you've provided, like,
culturewise to the company?

00:42:31.531 --> 00:42:33.030
LORD JOHN BROWNE:
No, I haven't been

00:42:33.030 --> 00:42:35.890
invited back up until recently.

00:42:35.890 --> 00:42:39.970
So, first of all, I do
not believe in-- in fact,

00:42:39.970 --> 00:42:45.740
I hate the idea of former CEOs
coming back into a company

00:42:45.740 --> 00:42:47.610
and saying, well,
you know, in my day,

00:42:47.610 --> 00:42:50.867
or this is a much better
way of doing things.

00:42:50.867 --> 00:42:52.825
Even worse, actually
commenting on the outside.

00:42:52.825 --> 00:42:56.280
I don't approve of that, either.

00:42:56.280 --> 00:42:59.976
Because the person in charge
is the person in charge.

00:42:59.976 --> 00:43:01.320
And they say, the king is dead.

00:43:01.320 --> 00:43:02.390
Long live the king.

00:43:02.390 --> 00:43:03.860
So it's gone.

00:43:03.860 --> 00:43:05.610
Its very ephemeral.

00:43:05.610 --> 00:43:07.950
And so I don't approve of that.

00:43:07.950 --> 00:43:12.300
I actually-- it took me five
years to go into the building,

00:43:12.300 --> 00:43:14.200
back into the BP building.

00:43:14.200 --> 00:43:17.910
And I was invited in not
by my successor, because he

00:43:17.910 --> 00:43:23.790
was let go after the Gulf
spill, but his successor, who

00:43:23.790 --> 00:43:28.360
also used to be my executive
assistant when I was a CEO.

00:43:28.360 --> 00:43:33.045
And he said, come and have
lunch on July the 4th.

00:43:33.045 --> 00:43:35.410
BP's open for business.

00:43:35.410 --> 00:43:37.360
So I went into the
building on July the 4th

00:43:37.360 --> 00:43:39.410
and had lunch and met everybody.

00:43:39.410 --> 00:43:40.610
It was very nice.

00:43:40.610 --> 00:43:43.300
And then I didn't go
back again until I

00:43:43.300 --> 00:43:48.140
was invited by BP to come and
talk about "The Glass Closet."

00:43:48.140 --> 00:43:53.010
And then I was invited
in, for those of you

00:43:53.010 --> 00:43:56.550
with historical perspectives,
on Bastille Day.

00:43:56.550 --> 00:43:59.610
Seems very appropriate
at the moment.

00:43:59.610 --> 00:44:01.590
The start of the revolution.

00:44:01.590 --> 00:44:03.510
It was just right.

00:44:03.510 --> 00:44:09.090
And so I was invited in
and interviewed, amazingly,

00:44:09.090 --> 00:44:11.904
by a rather wonderful
straight man who

00:44:11.904 --> 00:44:14.070
also used to be my executive
assistant now in charge

00:44:14.070 --> 00:44:17.070
of all the production
operations at BP.

00:44:17.070 --> 00:44:20.640
So he interviewed me, and
it was done, because BP is

00:44:20.640 --> 00:44:22.590
like Google, in lots of places.

00:44:22.590 --> 00:44:25.640
We did it in the media
center, and it was

00:44:25.640 --> 00:44:28.860
transmitted all over the world.

00:44:28.860 --> 00:44:30.410
So that was rather good.

00:44:30.410 --> 00:44:33.050
And a lot of change.

00:44:33.050 --> 00:44:35.280
It would have been
difficult to imagine

00:44:35.280 --> 00:44:42.820
inviting in any gay man,
let alone the former CEO,

00:44:42.820 --> 00:44:47.822
to BP eight years ago
to do such a thing.

00:44:47.822 --> 00:44:49.780
ARJAN DIJIK: You had
three questions, you said?

00:44:49.780 --> 00:44:50.446
AUDIENCE: Right.

00:44:50.446 --> 00:44:51.000
One last one.

00:44:51.000 --> 00:44:52.220
It's a little silly.

00:44:52.220 --> 00:44:55.590
You did mention earlier
Cleveland, Ohio,

00:44:55.590 --> 00:44:58.110
and your experience
working there.

00:44:58.110 --> 00:45:02.070
How did you feel about them
hosting the Gay Games earlier

00:45:02.070 --> 00:45:02.590
this year?

00:45:02.590 --> 00:45:04.506
LORD JOHN BROWNE: Well,
I was invited to them,

00:45:04.506 --> 00:45:06.160
and I couldn't make it.

00:45:06.160 --> 00:45:10.140
I used to work for the Standard
Oil Company, Ohio, there.

00:45:10.140 --> 00:45:12.140
I was in the
Standard Oil Company.

00:45:12.140 --> 00:45:14.510
And one of the people
who used to work for me

00:45:14.510 --> 00:45:20.280
is actually the president of
the Gay Games for the year.

00:45:20.280 --> 00:45:22.210
But I just couldn't make it.

00:45:22.210 --> 00:45:23.860
The timing was all wrong.

00:45:23.860 --> 00:45:25.952
But I think it was terrific.

00:45:25.952 --> 00:45:27.410
AUDIENCE: What
advice would you get

00:45:27.410 --> 00:45:29.930
to a young person at
a company that they

00:45:29.930 --> 00:45:32.425
felt like their career was
being stifled in some way

00:45:32.425 --> 00:45:33.612
by being out?

00:45:33.612 --> 00:45:35.570
Would you say you should
go to a company that's

00:45:35.570 --> 00:45:36.410
more open to that?

00:45:36.410 --> 00:45:37.390
Let's say Google.

00:45:37.390 --> 00:45:38.390
Or they should stay?

00:45:38.390 --> 00:45:42.260
Because an analogy can be
drawn for people in states

00:45:42.260 --> 00:45:43.740
like Alabama, for example.

00:45:43.740 --> 00:45:47.840
So, should all the
gay people in Alabama

00:45:47.840 --> 00:45:50.295
just move to San
Francisco and New York?

00:45:50.295 --> 00:45:51.780
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:45:51.780 --> 00:45:54.074
AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:45:54.074 --> 00:45:55.740
AUDIENCE: But in a
way, Alabama is never

00:45:55.740 --> 00:45:57.760
going to make progress if
gay people keep leaving,

00:45:57.760 --> 00:45:59.134
in the same way
corporations that

00:45:59.134 --> 00:46:02.175
are unfriendly to gay people are
never going to make progress.

00:46:02.175 --> 00:46:04.550
LORD JOHN BROWNE: I think it
depends on your future view,

00:46:04.550 --> 00:46:05.110
doesn't it?

00:46:05.110 --> 00:46:07.510
It depends on whether you
can see any progress at all.

00:46:07.510 --> 00:46:10.180
But, I mean, if it's
going backwards,

00:46:10.180 --> 00:46:15.340
then I'd suggest walking out
and doing something else,

00:46:15.340 --> 00:46:17.760
if you really do believe
nothing will change.

00:46:17.760 --> 00:46:20.140
But actually, a lot
of these places,

00:46:20.140 --> 00:46:22.740
you can see some
elements of change.

00:46:22.740 --> 00:46:26.380
So if you think you can see
it and you can be part of it,

00:46:26.380 --> 00:46:28.720
then stick with it.

00:46:28.720 --> 00:46:32.890
I do think it's important
that individuals

00:46:32.890 --> 00:46:36.970
try, insofar as possible, to
control their own destiny.

00:46:36.970 --> 00:46:40.302
There's nothing--
well, there are

00:46:40.302 --> 00:46:41.510
plenty of bad things in life.

00:46:41.510 --> 00:46:44.780
But one bad thing is
to feel that you're out

00:46:44.780 --> 00:46:48.090
of control of your own destiny.

00:46:48.090 --> 00:46:50.860
You know, someone is
pushing you around

00:46:50.860 --> 00:46:55.110
or doing something that doesn't
allow you to be yourself.

00:46:55.110 --> 00:46:57.450
But if you can see
changing that, then stay.

00:46:57.450 --> 00:47:00.180
If you can't, go.

00:47:00.180 --> 00:47:02.685
But it's an interesting
mind experiment

00:47:02.685 --> 00:47:06.570
to think of all the people from
Alabama going to both coasts.

00:47:06.570 --> 00:47:09.260
It would be extraordinary.

00:47:09.260 --> 00:47:11.510
AUDIENCE: So you could argue
that it's relatively easy

00:47:11.510 --> 00:47:14.845
for us, working at Google,
living in San Francisco

00:47:14.845 --> 00:47:16.300
or Shoreditch.

00:47:16.300 --> 00:47:18.050
At the same time, we
have a great platform

00:47:18.050 --> 00:47:20.860
to reach millions of
people, billions of people.

00:47:20.860 --> 00:47:22.090
What can we do to help?

00:47:22.090 --> 00:47:23.552
What is your message for us?

00:47:23.552 --> 00:47:25.010
LORD JOHN BROWNE:
Well, I think you

00:47:25.010 --> 00:47:30.886
can, because information and
little things like role models.

00:47:30.886 --> 00:47:33.010
And one of the reasons I
put together this little--

00:47:33.010 --> 00:47:36.610
founded this website,
glasscloset.org--

00:47:36.610 --> 00:47:38.450
it's not huge.

00:47:38.450 --> 00:47:42.100
But it's designed to
aggregate role model stories

00:47:42.100 --> 00:47:44.950
so that people can talk and see.

00:47:44.950 --> 00:47:49.530
So it's sort of getting this
information out, getting people

00:47:49.530 --> 00:47:51.180
to talk to each other.

00:47:51.180 --> 00:47:53.160
These things are very
important indeed.

00:47:57.530 --> 00:48:00.430
What is very
surprising is who gets

00:48:00.430 --> 00:48:06.240
to read the stuff outside
the UK and the USA.

00:48:06.240 --> 00:48:09.180
And the answer is, a
lot of places where it's

00:48:09.180 --> 00:48:13.410
illegal to do anything gay.

00:48:13.410 --> 00:48:18.530
People want to read it, because
they see in these stories

00:48:18.530 --> 00:48:22.550
an aspiration that they'd like
to hold that things could be

00:48:22.550 --> 00:48:25.070
different, and that actually,
they could be different

00:48:25.070 --> 00:48:27.800
themselves, and maybe
they can make a change.

00:48:27.800 --> 00:48:31.820
So I think Google can
participate in this hugely.

00:48:31.820 --> 00:48:33.450
Hugely.

00:48:33.450 --> 00:48:39.490
Because it does have the
footprint of the world.

00:48:39.490 --> 00:48:42.260
And the world also includes
places in the United States

00:48:42.260 --> 00:48:43.300
where it's tough.

00:48:43.300 --> 00:48:46.490
Also, places outside London and
Manchester where it's tough.

00:48:46.490 --> 00:48:49.640
Also places outside
Paris, and so forth.

00:48:49.640 --> 00:48:55.970
But also in places like
Saudi Arabia, and in Uganda,

00:48:55.970 --> 00:49:01.050
and now, I see Singapore, where
the supreme court has just

00:49:01.050 --> 00:49:03.680
reversed certain
rulings to, again,

00:49:03.680 --> 00:49:09.695
make it illegal to
undertake homosexual acts.

00:49:09.695 --> 00:49:11.570
ARJAN DIJIK: Well, I
think we're wrapping up.

00:49:11.570 --> 00:49:14.410
Maybe two short questions
with very short answers,

00:49:14.410 --> 00:49:17.510
which is you've been in
three locations at Google.

00:49:17.510 --> 00:49:19.110
What did you like worst?

00:49:19.110 --> 00:49:20.300
What disappointed you?

00:49:23.430 --> 00:49:25.125
And it can't be my t-shirt.

00:49:25.125 --> 00:49:26.750
LORD JOHN BROWNE:
It's not the t-shirt,

00:49:26.750 --> 00:49:29.090
and it's not the coffee, either.

00:49:29.090 --> 00:49:31.780
And certainly not
the food, I must say.

00:49:31.780 --> 00:49:40.470
I think the worst-- I think it's
that we met in internal rooms,

00:49:40.470 --> 00:49:42.380
with the single
exception of this.

00:49:42.380 --> 00:49:45.320
And I think this is a rather
wonderful room to meet in.

00:49:45.320 --> 00:49:49.550
It sounds trivial, but
it's very oppressive

00:49:49.550 --> 00:49:50.675
to meet in dark rooms.

00:49:50.675 --> 00:49:50.940
ARJAN DIJIK: Dark rooms.

00:49:50.940 --> 00:49:51.610
Yeah.

00:49:51.610 --> 00:49:54.950
And then the best thing,
to end on a positive note?

00:49:54.950 --> 00:49:57.550
LORD JOHN BROWNE: You know,
I think the best thing is

00:49:57.550 --> 00:49:59.430
every time I look at
an audience in Google,

00:49:59.430 --> 00:50:02.030
people are very interested.

00:50:02.030 --> 00:50:05.160
And what is surprising--
maybe there's a rule here--

00:50:05.160 --> 00:50:07.970
but I was warned in
New York and London

00:50:07.970 --> 00:50:11.720
that multitasking was
the name of the game,

00:50:11.720 --> 00:50:15.320
and that I should expect
people to be listening to me,

00:50:15.320 --> 00:50:18.410
but actually doing
something else.

00:50:18.410 --> 00:50:20.302
I haven't seen that happen here.

00:50:20.302 --> 00:50:21.260
ARJAN DIJIK: Minimally.

00:50:21.260 --> 00:50:23.530
I think minimally.

00:50:23.530 --> 00:50:26.530
LORD JOHN BROWNE: I think
it's rather wonderful.

00:50:26.530 --> 00:50:29.980
And I take it as
an important thing.

00:50:29.980 --> 00:50:30.590
So thank you.

00:50:30.590 --> 00:50:31.548
ARJAN DIJIK: Wonderful.

00:50:31.548 --> 00:50:32.710
Well, thank you very much.

00:50:32.710 --> 00:50:33.310
Thank you.

00:50:33.310 --> 00:50:36.660
[APPLAUSE]
