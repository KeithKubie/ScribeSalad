00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:02.620
The second piece of data
we need from this group,

00:00:02.620 --> 00:00:06.120
is the longitude, which we'll get
from the coordinates of each game.

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:11.070
Here we're using the map function,
defined on JavaScript arrays,

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:15.900
which simply transforms every element
of an array, and returns an array back.

00:00:16.990 --> 00:00:20.450
So again, in the callback
function we passed a map.

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:24.190
It gets passed d,
which is every elements of leaves, and

00:00:24.190 --> 00:00:28.790
whatever we've returned gets
stored in the return array cords.

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:34.240
In this case, we want to go from the
latitude and longitude of our data point

00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:37.950
to some pixel value,
which we get from our projection here.

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:42.060
So again, the projection can be
thought of just like a scale

00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:45.910
that takes as input a longitude and
latitude pair.

00:00:45.910 --> 00:00:51.040
And gives as output a pixel X and
Y back.

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:52.210
Now you might be wondering

00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:54.930
what we're actually doing
with the coordinates here.

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:59.000
Well we could have of looked up
the home country name from our data.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:03.130
And centered each circle on our map and
the center of that country.

00:01:03.130 --> 00:01:05.090
But for maximum flexibility,

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:08.530
especially since West Germany
is no longer a country.

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:13.650
And the 2002 World Cup was held
in both South Korea and Japan.

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:17.360
I simply chose to compute
the central location

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:20.690
of all the locations of games for
a given year.

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:25.720
Or, more visually, if there were
four stadiums for a given year, we

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:30.550
first convert the latitude and longitude
of each stadium to a pixel value,

00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:35.730
since averaging latitude and longitude
can be slightly more complicated.

00:01:35.730 --> 00:01:41.065
And since in the end we want to a pixel
value to plot on our webpage anyways.

00:01:41.065 --> 00:01:45.290
We're going to simply compute
the average x-value and the average

00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:50.205
y-value of all the games to get some
point they'll be placed centrally.
