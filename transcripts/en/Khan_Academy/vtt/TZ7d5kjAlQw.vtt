00:00:00.205 --> 00:00:01.948
Narrator: In the last video we saw how

00:00:01.948 --> 00:00:04.400
everyone in country A got
excited about investing

00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:06.775
in country B and so they
wanted to convert their

00:00:06.775 --> 00:00:09.937
currency into country B's currency.

00:00:09.937 --> 00:00:13.187
Left to its own devices
with this new demand

00:00:13.187 --> 00:00:16.273
for currency B, it would
have made currency B

00:00:16.273 --> 00:00:19.127
more expensive, but
instead of allowing that

00:00:19.127 --> 00:00:22.272
to happen the central bank of country B

00:00:22.272 --> 00:00:23.979
said no, no, no, no,
no, I want to keep the

00:00:23.979 --> 00:00:25.947
exchange rates relatively stable,

00:00:25.947 --> 00:00:29.284
so I'm going to print
B's and use those to buy

00:00:29.284 --> 00:00:30.618
up A's.

00:00:30.618 --> 00:00:32.729
So at the end of that
video the central bank of

00:00:32.729 --> 00:00:36.818
country B ended up with
foreign currency reserves.

00:00:36.818 --> 00:00:40.051
It ended up with some of A's currency

00:00:40.051 --> 00:00:41.929
on its balance sheet.

00:00:41.929 --> 00:00:43.466
What I want to do in
this video is think about

00:00:43.466 --> 00:00:46.064
what if demand goes the other way

00:00:46.064 --> 00:00:48.865
and how could the central
bank use its foreign

00:00:48.865 --> 00:00:51.335
currency reserves to prevent its currency

00:00:51.335 --> 00:00:52.932
from devaluing.

00:00:52.932 --> 00:00:56.192
Let's go to the next stage in our little

00:00:56.192 --> 00:00:58.265
hypothetical story here.

00:00:58.265 --> 00:01:00.659
Let's say people in A,
all of this investment

00:01:00.659 --> 00:01:03.329
happened in country B,
everyone was all excited.

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:07.114
Probably a bubble was forming of some kind

00:01:07.114 --> 00:01:09.003
and then all of the sudden the investors

00:01:09.003 --> 00:01:10.741
in country A start to
get a little bit scared.

00:01:10.741 --> 00:01:13.002
They start to hear reports
of the bubble forming,

00:01:13.002 --> 00:01:15.904
they start to realize that
conditions in country B

00:01:15.904 --> 00:01:17.817
weren't as good as they thought it might

00:01:17.817 --> 00:01:20.935
have been initially,
so they start to panic.

00:01:20.935 --> 00:01:24.678
They start wanting to
unwind their investments.

00:01:24.678 --> 00:01:27.159
Whatever they had in country
B they want to sell it,

00:01:27.159 --> 00:01:29.745
they get B's currency
for it and they want to

00:01:29.745 --> 00:01:32.237
convert that to their home currency.

00:01:32.237 --> 00:01:34.075
Now you have the reverse situation

00:01:34.075 --> 00:01:36.074
of what we saw in the last video.

00:01:36.074 --> 00:01:39.491
Everyone wants to sell their B's,

00:01:39.491 --> 00:01:41.873
so they had invested in country B

00:01:41.873 --> 00:01:43.334
maybe they had bought
some real estate there,

00:01:43.334 --> 00:01:44.286
they're going to sell their real estate,

00:01:44.286 --> 00:01:45.490
they're going to get B's for it

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:47.012
and then they're going to get out of that

00:01:47.012 --> 00:01:47.923
countries currency.

00:01:47.923 --> 00:01:49.405
They're going to want
to convert that money

00:01:49.405 --> 00:01:52.586
back in to A's, but this
is the opposite situation.

00:01:52.586 --> 00:01:54.318
Now everyone wants to run out of country B

00:01:54.318 --> 00:01:59.980
and there isn't a lot of
supply of A's in return.

00:01:59.980 --> 00:02:02.325
No one's really looking
to trade A's for B's now.

00:02:02.325 --> 00:02:04.780
Everyone is irked, the
market is going completely

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:07.319
in the opposite direction.

00:02:07.319 --> 00:02:10.318
If, once again, foreign exchange markets

00:02:10.318 --> 00:02:13.455
were allowed to float
freely what would happen?

00:02:13.455 --> 00:02:16.819
In this situation all
the demand is for the A's

00:02:16.819 --> 00:02:19.316
and all the supply is on the B's

00:02:19.316 --> 00:02:23.384
so you would have either more ...

00:02:23.384 --> 00:02:25.387
Let me write it this
way, you would have fewer

00:02:25.387 --> 00:02:27.050
A's per B.

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:30.654
(writing) Fewer A's per B

00:02:30.654 --> 00:02:34.156
... or you could have more B's per A.

00:02:34.156 --> 00:02:35.993
These are the same statement.

00:02:35.993 --> 00:02:39.255
(writing) More B's per A.

00:02:39.255 --> 00:02:42.185
In general, A has now
become more expensive

00:02:42.185 --> 00:02:49.188
in terms of B or B has
become cheaper in terms of A.

00:02:49.188 --> 00:02:50.587
Let's say you're the central bank

00:02:50.587 --> 00:02:52.074
and you say well I don't like this either.

00:02:52.074 --> 00:02:54.991
Now all of a sudden,
usually this unwinding,

00:02:54.991 --> 00:02:56.904
this panic happens much faster

00:02:56.904 --> 00:02:59.587
and in more dramatic
fashion than the initial

00:02:59.587 --> 00:03:00.918
phase over here.

00:03:00.918 --> 00:03:02.584
You say, oh my God people in our country

00:03:02.584 --> 00:03:04.072
they might not be able to ...

00:03:04.072 --> 00:03:07.452
If this were to happen
foreign imports would become

00:03:07.452 --> 00:03:09.255
so expensive people
might not be able to even

00:03:09.255 --> 00:03:11.989
afford food that we have to import from

00:03:11.989 --> 00:03:13.716
other countries or essential supplies

00:03:13.716 --> 00:03:15.319
from other countries.

00:03:15.319 --> 00:03:17.073
So they say, no, we're going to intervene.

00:03:17.073 --> 00:03:18.586
We were able to accumulate some of these

00:03:18.586 --> 00:03:21.073
foreign currency reserves
so we can use those

00:03:21.073 --> 00:03:23.712
now to try to stabilize our currency.

00:03:23.712 --> 00:03:26.521
In this situation what
the central bank would do

00:03:26.521 --> 00:03:28.382
is say okay I've got some reserves of A

00:03:28.382 --> 00:03:30.585
what I'm going to do is I'm going to go

00:03:30.585 --> 00:03:31.921
into the open market.

00:03:31.921 --> 00:03:33.916
I'm going to go into the open market

00:03:33.916 --> 00:03:36.320
and also sell my reserves ...

00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:41.654
and sell my reserves of
A and try to equalize

00:03:41.654 --> 00:03:44.251
the supply and the demand.

00:03:44.251 --> 00:03:46.238
So, once again, if
they're able to sell these

00:03:46.238 --> 00:03:48.484
reserves, now all of the
sudden their currency

00:03:48.484 --> 00:03:51.988
will not devalue or maybe
not devalue as much.

00:03:51.988 --> 00:03:54.995
The one kink in the system
here is that they only

00:03:54.995 --> 00:03:58.587
have a finite of reserves.

00:03:58.587 --> 00:04:02.154
This right over here is finite.

00:04:02.154 --> 00:04:04.585
In the previous video
when we saw that they were

00:04:04.585 --> 00:04:07.325
printing their own
currency to build reserves,

00:04:07.325 --> 00:04:08.856
they could do this all day, all night

00:04:08.856 --> 00:04:10.784
because they have the
right to print as much

00:04:10.784 --> 00:04:12.454
of their own currency as they want.

00:04:12.454 --> 00:04:14.914
But now they are using
reserves of someone elses

00:04:14.914 --> 00:04:17.183
currency to keep their own currency from

00:04:17.183 --> 00:04:19.657
being devalued, but
they can't print someone

00:04:19.657 --> 00:04:20.853
else's currency.

00:04:20.853 --> 00:04:24.446
They're hoping that what they have on hand

00:04:24.446 --> 00:04:27.316
is enough to fight this
... what they're probably

00:04:27.316 --> 00:04:29.311
perceiving is a short term imbalance,

00:04:29.311 --> 00:04:30.663
but it could be scary.

00:04:30.663 --> 00:04:33.189
What happens if all of
this currency runs out?

00:04:33.189 --> 00:04:35.117
Then they blow all of
their currency reserves

00:04:35.117 --> 00:04:37.913
and if this kind of panic keeps occurring

00:04:37.913 --> 00:04:40.160
then you're going to go
back to the free market

00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:43.452
forces and their currency
will have to devalue.

00:04:43.452 --> 00:04:49.585
That's how central banks attempt to keep

00:04:49.585 --> 00:04:51.512
their currencies relatively stable.

00:04:51.512 --> 00:04:54.772
In future videos we'll go through real

00:04:54.772 --> 00:04:56.316
cases of when this happened

00:04:56.316 --> 00:04:58.514
and what exactly happened when the foreign

00:04:58.514 --> 00:05:01.552
currency reserves ran
out and how speculators

00:05:01.552 --> 00:05:04.778
could use that knowledge
to essentially make

00:05:04.778 --> 00:05:08.027
an easy speculative buck.
