talk let's just stick with N equals two

00:00:19.519 --> 00:00:19.529
talk let's just stick with N equals two
 

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:22.040
talk let's just stick with N equals two
that is let's just look at such sets in

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:22.050
that is let's just look at such sets in
 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:24.560
that is let's just look at such sets in
the plane so let's look at some examples

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:24.570
the plane so let's look at some examples
 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:29.290
the plane so let's look at some examples
for instance the circle the square or

00:00:29.290 --> 00:00:29.300
for instance the circle the square or
 

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:34.100
for instance the circle the square or
the triangle so those are convex compact

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:34.110
the triangle so those are convex compact
 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:36.380
the triangle so those are convex compact
sets in the plane so what does that mean

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:36.390
sets in the plane so what does that mean
 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:39.229
sets in the plane so what does that mean
compact means that the set is bounded

00:00:39.229 --> 00:00:39.239
compact means that the set is bounded
 

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:42.110
compact means that the set is bounded
bounded means that there is no direction

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:42.120
bounded means that there is no direction
 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:44.479
bounded means that there is no direction
where you can wander off to infinity so

00:00:44.479 --> 00:00:44.489
where you can wander off to infinity so
 

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:46.040
where you can wander off to infinity so
for instance if we looked at something

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:46.050
for instance if we looked at something
 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:49.279
for instance if we looked at something
like so right and we'd be allowed to

00:00:49.279 --> 00:00:49.289
like so right and we'd be allowed to
 

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:51.830
like so right and we'd be allowed to
continue here then we could march off to

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:51.840
continue here then we could march off to
 

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:53.720
continue here then we could march off to
infinity here and that is not allowed

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:53.730
infinity here and that is not allowed
 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:55.580
infinity here and that is not allowed
now what's the other ingredient that we

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:55.590
now what's the other ingredient that we
 

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:58.040
now what's the other ingredient that we
have it's convex so what does that mean

00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:58.050
have it's convex so what does that mean
 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:00.439
have it's convex so what does that mean
it means that whenever we take two

00:01:00.439 --> 00:01:00.449
it means that whenever we take two
 

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:02.869
it means that whenever we take two
points in the set in question like for

00:01:02.869 --> 00:01:02.879
points in the set in question like for
 

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:04.759
points in the set in question like for
instance here in the circle and we look

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:04.769
instance here in the circle and we look
 

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:07.340
instance here in the circle and we look
at the line segment that joins the two

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:07.350
at the line segment that joins the two
 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:10.609
at the line segment that joins the two
then we stay completely in the set the

00:01:10.609 --> 00:01:10.619
then we stay completely in the set the
 

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:12.800
then we stay completely in the set the
same here we'll take two points we look

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:12.810
same here we'll take two points we look
 

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:14.960
same here we'll take two points we look
at the line segment that joins them we

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:14.970
at the line segment that joins them we
 

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:16.999
at the line segment that joins them we
stay completely in the set saying here

00:01:16.999 --> 00:01:17.009
stay completely in the set saying here
 

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:19.399
stay completely in the set saying here
take two points that are in the set we

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:19.409
take two points that are in the set we
 

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:21.020
take two points that are in the set we
look at the line segment we'll stay

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:21.030
look at the line segment we'll stay
 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:22.820
look at the line segment we'll stay
completely in the set so for instance

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:22.830
completely in the set so for instance
 

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:24.560
completely in the set so for instance
what would not be allowed is something

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:24.570
what would not be allowed is something
 

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:29.539
what would not be allowed is something
like so right here if we take that point

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:29.549
like so right here if we take that point
 

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:31.280
like so right here if we take that point
and that point and we look at the line

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:31.290
and that point and we look at the line
 

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:33.080
and that point and we look at the line
segment that joins the true then we are

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:33.090
segment that joins the true then we are
 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:36.319
segment that joins the true then we are
outside the set so for such convex

00:01:36.319 --> 00:01:36.329
outside the set so for such convex
 

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:39.620
outside the set so for such convex
compact sets let's call them K we'll

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:39.630
compact sets let's call them K we'll
 

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:41.990
compact sets let's call them K we'll
look at the floating bodies so let's

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:42.000
look at the floating bodies so let's
 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.230
look at the floating bodies so let's
take K convex compact so everything that

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:45.240
take K convex compact so everything that
 

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:48.590
take K convex compact so everything that
I am talking to you guys about can be

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:48.600
I am talking to you guys about can be
 

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:51.620
I am talking to you guys about can be
done in any dimension as I said but

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:51.630
done in any dimension as I said but
 

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:53.359
done in any dimension as I said but
let's stay in the plane so we'll have

00:01:53.359 --> 00:01:53.369
let's stay in the plane so we'll have
 

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:57.530
let's stay in the plane so we'll have
here our K convex compact and then we

00:01:57.530 --> 00:01:57.540
here our K convex compact and then we
 

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:00.560
here our K convex compact and then we
also give ourselves a parameter Delta so

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:00.570
also give ourselves a parameter Delta so
 

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:02.690
also give ourselves a parameter Delta so
that's just a number typically think of

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:02.700
that's just a number typically think of
 

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:05.330
that's just a number typically think of
Delta being small and then we'll take a

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:05.340
Delta being small and then we'll take a
 

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:07.940
Delta being small and then we'll take a
line and if we were in our dimension

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:07.950
line and if we were in our dimension
 

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:09.919
line and if we were in our dimension
three instead of a line we would take a

00:02:09.919 --> 00:02:09.929
three instead of a line we would take a
 

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:12.229
three instead of a line we would take a
plane and if we were in higher dimension

00:02:12.229 --> 00:02:12.239
plane and if we were in higher dimension
 

00:02:12.239 --> 00:02:12.530
plane and if we were in higher dimension
we

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:12.540
we
 

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:14.089
we
would take what is called a hyperplane

00:02:14.089 --> 00:02:14.099
would take what is called a hyperplane
 

00:02:14.099 --> 00:02:16.160
would take what is called a hyperplane
but will stay in the plane so we'll take

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:16.170
but will stay in the plane so we'll take
 

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:19.399
but will stay in the plane so we'll take
a line L and then we'll take a line such

00:02:19.399 --> 00:02:19.409
a line L and then we'll take a line such
 

00:02:19.409 --> 00:02:23.179
a line L and then we'll take a line such
that it cuts off a set of area Delta

00:02:23.179 --> 00:02:23.189
that it cuts off a set of area Delta
 

00:02:23.189 --> 00:02:25.970
that it cuts off a set of area Delta
from K so then we'll look at the

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:25.980
from K so then we'll look at the
 

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:29.059
from K so then we'll look at the
intersection of this line with the body

00:02:29.059 --> 00:02:29.069
intersection of this line with the body
 

00:02:29.069 --> 00:02:31.640
intersection of this line with the body
K so we look at this intersection and

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:31.650
K so we look at this intersection and
 

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:34.309
K so we look at this intersection and
then we'll take the midpoint of this

00:02:34.309 --> 00:02:34.319
then we'll take the midpoint of this
 

00:02:34.319 --> 00:02:36.679
then we'll take the midpoint of this
intersection and then we'll take another

00:02:36.679 --> 00:02:36.689
intersection and then we'll take another
 

00:02:36.689 --> 00:02:41.179
intersection and then we'll take another
line L that cuts of Delta we'll look at

00:02:41.179 --> 00:02:41.189
line L that cuts of Delta we'll look at
 

00:02:41.189 --> 00:02:43.970
line L that cuts of Delta we'll look at
the intersection and we'll take the

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:43.980
the intersection and we'll take the
 

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:46.879
the intersection and we'll take the
midpoint and we'll keep doing this so we

00:02:46.879 --> 00:02:46.889
midpoint and we'll keep doing this so we
 

00:02:46.889 --> 00:02:49.339
midpoint and we'll keep doing this so we
look at all those lines look at their

00:02:49.339 --> 00:02:49.349
look at all those lines look at their
 

00:02:49.349 --> 00:02:52.129
look at all those lines look at their
intersection take the midpoint and then

00:02:52.129 --> 00:02:52.139
intersection take the midpoint and then
 

00:02:52.139 --> 00:02:55.550
intersection take the midpoint and then
we'll look at let's draw it in color we

00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:55.560
we'll look at let's draw it in color we
 

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:58.909
we'll look at let's draw it in color we
will look at the we trace out the curve

00:02:58.909 --> 00:02:58.919
will look at the we trace out the curve
 

00:02:58.919 --> 00:03:02.659
will look at the we trace out the curve
of these midpoints and in that way we

00:03:02.659 --> 00:03:02.669
of these midpoints and in that way we
 

00:03:02.669 --> 00:03:08.539
of these midpoints and in that way we
obtain a set inside K so this red set is

00:03:08.539 --> 00:03:08.549
obtain a set inside K so this red set is
 

00:03:08.549 --> 00:03:11.750
obtain a set inside K so this red set is
the floating body let's give it a name

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:11.760
the floating body let's give it a name
 

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:15.800
the floating body let's give it a name

Archimedean principle we know that an

00:03:24.649 --> 00:03:24.659
Archimedean principle we know that an
 

00:03:24.659 --> 00:03:27.110
Archimedean principle we know that an
object floating in water so if you have

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:27.120

water surface these lawns that you drew
each time you were snipping off like a

00:03:39.409 --> 00:03:39.419
each time you were snipping off like a

infinitely many all possible lines that
we can draw that chop off Delta my first

00:03:48.050 --> 00:03:48.060
we can draw that chop off Delta my first
 

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:50.449
we can draw that chop off Delta my first
instinct without having seen this done

00:03:50.449 --> 00:03:50.459
instinct without having seen this done
 

00:03:50.459 --> 00:03:53.240
instinct without having seen this done
would be that all you do is make like a

00:03:53.240 --> 00:03:53.250
would be that all you do is make like a
 

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:55.189
would be that all you do is make like a
miniature version of the bigger set

00:03:55.189 --> 00:03:55.199
miniature version of the bigger set
 

00:03:55.199 --> 00:03:57.379
miniature version of the bigger set
that's not what happens no that's not

00:03:57.379 --> 00:03:57.389
that's not what happens no that's not
 

00:03:57.389 --> 00:03:58.969
that's not what happens no that's not
what happens and we will see that when

00:03:58.969 --> 00:03:58.979
what happens and we will see that when
 

00:03:58.979 --> 00:04:01.369
what happens and we will see that when
we look at when we compute actually

00:04:01.369 --> 00:04:01.379
we look at when we compute actually
 

00:04:01.379 --> 00:04:03.589
we look at when we compute actually
those for the various examples then we

00:04:03.589 --> 00:04:03.599
those for the various examples then we
 

00:04:03.599 --> 00:04:05.240
those for the various examples then we
will see that it's not what's happening

00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:05.250
will see that it's not what's happening
 

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:07.429
will see that it's not what's happening
let's do it so for the circle that's

00:04:07.429 --> 00:04:07.439
let's do it so for the circle that's
 

00:04:07.439 --> 00:04:10.909
let's do it so for the circle that's
easy so here we go let's say the circle

00:04:10.909 --> 00:04:10.919
easy so here we go let's say the circle
 

00:04:10.919 --> 00:04:13.429
easy so here we go let's say the circle
has radius 1 then what do we have to do

00:04:13.429 --> 00:04:13.439
has radius 1 then what do we have to do
 

00:04:13.439 --> 00:04:16.129
has radius 1 then what do we have to do
we'll have to look at all lines L that

00:04:16.129 --> 00:04:16.139
we'll have to look at all lines L that
 

00:04:16.139 --> 00:04:19.219
we'll have to look at all lines L that
chop off a set of area Delta and we'll

00:04:19.219 --> 00:04:19.229
chop off a set of area Delta and we'll
 

00:04:19.229 --> 00:04:20.629
chop off a set of area Delta and we'll
have to take the midpoint of the

00:04:20.629 --> 00:04:20.639
have to take the midpoint of the
 

00:04:20.639 --> 00:04:22.909
have to take the midpoint of the
intersection so because the circle has

00:04:22.909 --> 00:04:22.919
intersection so because the circle has
 

00:04:22.919 --> 00:04:25.010
intersection so because the circle has
all the symmetries what will end up as

00:04:25.010 --> 00:04:25.020
all the symmetries what will end up as
 

00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:26.330
all the symmetries what will end up as
our floating body

00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:26.340
our floating body
 

00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:29.629
our floating body
again a circle so we'll end up with this

00:04:29.629 --> 00:04:29.639
again a circle so we'll end up with this
 

00:04:29.639 --> 00:04:33.260
again a circle so we'll end up with this
circle here which has now radius of

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:33.270
circle here which has now radius of
 

00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:35.659
circle here which has now radius of
course more than one and one can compute

00:04:35.659 --> 00:04:35.669
course more than one and one can compute
 

00:04:35.669 --> 00:04:40.400
course more than one and one can compute
it it's actually 1 minus 1/2 3 over 2 to

00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:40.410
it it's actually 1 minus 1/2 3 over 2 to
 

00:04:40.410 --> 00:04:44.150
it it's actually 1 minus 1/2 3 over 2 to
the 2 over 3 Delta to the 2 over 3 so

00:04:44.150 --> 00:04:44.160
the 2 over 3 Delta to the 2 over 3 so
 

00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:46.070
the 2 over 3 Delta to the 2 over 3 so
that's the radius of this floating

00:04:46.070 --> 00:04:46.080
that's the radius of this floating
 

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:48.890
that's the radius of this floating
circle let's look at our other example

00:04:48.890 --> 00:04:48.900
circle let's look at our other example
 

00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:52.070
circle let's look at our other example
which was the square and let's put it in

00:04:52.070 --> 00:04:52.080
which was the square and let's put it in
 

00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:54.320
which was the square and let's put it in
such a way that it's centered at 0 and

00:04:54.320 --> 00:04:54.330
such a way that it's centered at 0 and
 

00:04:54.330 --> 00:04:57.500
such a way that it's centered at 0 and
has side length 2 so here is 1 and here

00:04:57.500 --> 00:04:57.510
has side length 2 so here is 1 and here
 

00:04:57.510 --> 00:05:00.230
has side length 2 so here is 1 and here
is 1 so if we want to get the equation

00:05:00.230 --> 00:05:00.240
is 1 so if we want to get the equation
 

00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:03.469
is 1 so if we want to get the equation
of the floating body or the boundary of

00:05:03.469 --> 00:05:03.479
of the floating body or the boundary of
 

00:05:03.479 --> 00:05:05.570
of the floating body or the boundary of
the floating body let's put the x axis

00:05:05.570 --> 00:05:05.580
the floating body let's put the x axis
 

00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:08.690
the floating body let's put the x axis
here the y axis here and then we can

00:05:08.690 --> 00:05:08.700
here the y axis here and then we can
 

00:05:08.700 --> 00:05:11.690
here the y axis here and then we can
show that actually it's enough to

00:05:11.690 --> 00:05:11.700
show that actually it's enough to
 

00:05:11.700 --> 00:05:14.840
show that actually it's enough to
compute the shape of the boundary of the

00:05:14.840 --> 00:05:14.850
compute the shape of the boundary of the
 

00:05:14.850 --> 00:05:16.790
compute the shape of the boundary of the
floating body just in the first quadrant

00:05:16.790 --> 00:05:16.800
floating body just in the first quadrant
 

00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:19.219
floating body just in the first quadrant
here by symmetry we'll get the other

00:05:19.219 --> 00:05:19.229
here by symmetry we'll get the other
 

00:05:19.229 --> 00:05:21.950
here by symmetry we'll get the other
ones and we can show ok its shape is

00:05:21.950 --> 00:05:21.960
ones and we can show ok its shape is
 

00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:25.310
ones and we can show ok its shape is
something like so and then by symmetry

00:05:25.310 --> 00:05:25.320
something like so and then by symmetry
 

00:05:25.320 --> 00:05:27.620
something like so and then by symmetry
we can complete the picture so the

00:05:27.620 --> 00:05:27.630
we can complete the picture so the
 

00:05:27.630 --> 00:05:30.200
we can complete the picture so the
floating body of the square will look

00:05:30.200 --> 00:05:30.210
floating body of the square will look
 

00:05:30.210 --> 00:05:32.900
floating body of the square will look
like so and we can write down let's

00:05:32.900 --> 00:05:32.910
like so and we can write down let's
 

00:05:32.910 --> 00:05:35.210
like so and we can write down let's
write down the equation for this part in

00:05:35.210 --> 00:05:35.220
write down the equation for this part in
 

00:05:35.220 --> 00:05:36.950
write down the equation for this part in
the first quadrant and then this is

00:05:36.950 --> 00:05:36.960
the first quadrant and then this is
 

00:05:36.960 --> 00:05:39.610
the first quadrant and then this is
simply Delta over 2 is equal to 1 minus

00:05:39.610 --> 00:05:39.620
simply Delta over 2 is equal to 1 minus
 

00:05:39.620 --> 00:05:41.600
simply Delta over 2 is equal to 1 minus
x1 minus wife

00:05:41.600 --> 00:05:41.610
x1 minus wife
 

00:05:41.610 --> 00:05:44.210
x1 minus wife
that's not know it's not a circle in

00:05:44.210 --> 00:05:44.220
that's not know it's not a circle in
 

00:05:44.220 --> 00:05:46.850
that's not know it's not a circle in
there and but what we also see is that

00:05:46.850 --> 00:05:46.860
there and but what we also see is that
 

00:05:46.860 --> 00:05:49.370
there and but what we also see is that
it's not like you know the original

00:05:49.370 --> 00:05:49.380
it's not like you know the original
 

00:05:49.380 --> 00:05:51.770
it's not like you know the original
shape we started with it actually looks

00:05:51.770 --> 00:05:51.780
shape we started with it actually looks
 

00:05:51.780 --> 00:05:54.500
shape we started with it actually looks
different let's look at the last one of

00:05:54.500 --> 00:05:54.510
different let's look at the last one of
 

00:05:54.510 --> 00:05:56.480
different let's look at the last one of
our examples that we put up there which

00:05:56.480 --> 00:05:56.490
our examples that we put up there which
 

00:05:56.490 --> 00:05:58.370
our examples that we put up there which
is the triangle we draw the floating

00:05:58.370 --> 00:05:58.380
is the triangle we draw the floating
 

00:05:58.380 --> 00:06:06.460
is the triangle we draw the floating
body then we will get something like so

00:06:06.460 --> 00:06:06.470
 

00:06:06.470 --> 00:06:08.870
so that is the floating body of the

00:06:08.870 --> 00:06:08.880
so that is the floating body of the
 

00:06:08.880 --> 00:06:10.969
so that is the floating body of the
triangle so that looks very strange now

00:06:10.969 --> 00:06:10.979
triangle so that looks very strange now
 

00:06:10.979 --> 00:06:12.710
triangle so that looks very strange now
very different from the other ones in

00:06:12.710 --> 00:06:12.720
very different from the other ones in
 

00:06:12.720 --> 00:06:14.960
very different from the other ones in
particular the floating body of the

00:06:14.960 --> 00:06:14.970
particular the floating body of the
 

00:06:14.970 --> 00:06:17.300
particular the floating body of the
circle in the square they were giving us

00:06:17.300 --> 00:06:17.310
circle in the square they were giving us
 

00:06:17.310 --> 00:06:19.940
circle in the square they were giving us
again convex objects whereas this is

00:06:19.940 --> 00:06:19.950
again convex objects whereas this is
 

00:06:19.950 --> 00:06:22.730
again convex objects whereas this is
certainly not convex at all and that's

00:06:22.730 --> 00:06:22.740
certainly not convex at all and that's
 

00:06:22.740 --> 00:06:24.620
certainly not convex at all and that's
actually something we are not too happy

00:06:24.620 --> 00:06:24.630
actually something we are not too happy
 

00:06:24.630 --> 00:06:27.860
actually something we are not too happy
about and we want to change that so how

00:06:27.860 --> 00:06:27.870
about and we want to change that so how
 

00:06:27.870 --> 00:06:31.700
about and we want to change that so how
do we come upon this strange shape for

00:06:31.700 --> 00:06:31.710
do we come upon this strange shape for
 

00:06:31.710 --> 00:06:32.480
do we come upon this strange shape for
the triangle

00:06:32.480 --> 00:06:32.490
the triangle
 

00:06:32.490 --> 00:06:35.540
the triangle
well we remember what we have to do to

00:06:35.540 --> 00:06:35.550
well we remember what we have to do to
 

00:06:35.550 --> 00:06:37.580
well we remember what we have to do to
get our floating body is this operation

00:06:37.580 --> 00:06:37.590
get our floating body is this operation
 

00:06:37.590 --> 00:06:40.399
get our floating body is this operation
that cutting of sets of

00:06:40.399 --> 00:06:40.409
that cutting of sets of
 

00:06:40.409 --> 00:06:43.100
that cutting of sets of
area Delta with our lines and taking the

00:06:43.100 --> 00:06:43.110
area Delta with our lines and taking the
 

00:06:43.110 --> 00:06:44.959
area Delta with our lines and taking the
midpoints so for instance if we took

00:06:44.959 --> 00:06:44.969
midpoints so for instance if we took
 

00:06:44.969 --> 00:06:47.029
midpoints so for instance if we took
this line we would get that midpoint and

00:06:47.029 --> 00:06:47.039
this line we would get that midpoint and
 

00:06:47.039 --> 00:06:50.149
this line we would get that midpoint and
then if we moved with our line like so

00:06:50.149 --> 00:06:50.159
then if we moved with our line like so
 

00:06:50.159 --> 00:06:53.389
then if we moved with our line like so
always cutting off Delta and taking the

00:06:53.389 --> 00:06:53.399
always cutting off Delta and taking the
 

00:06:53.399 --> 00:06:55.159
always cutting off Delta and taking the
midpoints then we would be moving along

00:06:55.159 --> 00:06:55.169
midpoints then we would be moving along
 

00:06:55.169 --> 00:06:58.729
midpoints then we would be moving along
this curve here and we would end up well

00:06:58.729 --> 00:06:58.739
this curve here and we would end up well
 

00:06:58.739 --> 00:07:00.919
this curve here and we would end up well
now my picture is not super good we

00:07:00.919 --> 00:07:00.929
now my picture is not super good we
 

00:07:00.929 --> 00:07:03.109
now my picture is not super good we
would end up this line giving us as a

00:07:03.109 --> 00:07:03.119
would end up this line giving us as a
 

00:07:03.119 --> 00:07:06.979
would end up this line giving us as a
midpoint that point here and then if we

00:07:06.979 --> 00:07:06.989
midpoint that point here and then if we
 

00:07:06.989 --> 00:07:09.739
midpoint that point here and then if we
kept moving then the line would go down

00:07:09.739 --> 00:07:09.749
kept moving then the line would go down
 

00:07:09.749 --> 00:07:13.309
kept moving then the line would go down
here and up there and that then means

00:07:13.309 --> 00:07:13.319
here and up there and that then means
 

00:07:13.319 --> 00:07:14.769
here and up there and that then means
that we are actually moving backwards

00:07:14.769 --> 00:07:14.779
that we are actually moving backwards
 

00:07:14.779 --> 00:07:18.139
that we are actually moving backwards
along that curve here till we hit this

00:07:18.139 --> 00:07:18.149
along that curve here till we hit this
 

00:07:18.149 --> 00:07:21.259
along that curve here till we hit this
point where the at this point is the

00:07:21.259 --> 00:07:21.269
point where the at this point is the
 

00:07:21.269 --> 00:07:23.149
point where the at this point is the
midpoint of the line that shop's of

00:07:23.149 --> 00:07:23.159
midpoint of the line that shop's of
 

00:07:23.159 --> 00:07:25.489
midpoint of the line that shop's of
Delta and is parallel to the site of the

00:07:25.489 --> 00:07:25.499
Delta and is parallel to the site of the
 

00:07:25.499 --> 00:07:28.129
Delta and is parallel to the site of the
triangle and then we go here and move up

00:07:28.129 --> 00:07:28.139
triangle and then we go here and move up
 

00:07:28.139 --> 00:07:31.850
triangle and then we go here and move up
there so as I said here we'll get

00:07:31.850 --> 00:07:31.860
there so as I said here we'll get
 

00:07:31.860 --> 00:07:35.029
there so as I said here we'll get
something that is not convex and that is

00:07:35.029 --> 00:07:35.039
something that is not convex and that is
 

00:07:35.039 --> 00:07:38.629
something that is not convex and that is
not what we like because we want to use

00:07:38.629 --> 00:07:38.639
not what we like because we want to use
 

00:07:38.639 --> 00:07:40.639
not what we like because we want to use
these floating bodies as a particular

00:07:40.639 --> 00:07:40.649
these floating bodies as a particular
 

00:07:40.649 --> 00:07:46.009
these floating bodies as a particular
tool no it's not a mistake it's just so

00:07:46.009 --> 00:07:46.019
tool no it's not a mistake it's just so
 

00:07:46.019 --> 00:07:49.579
tool no it's not a mistake it's just so
happens that yeah that comes out using

00:07:49.579 --> 00:07:49.589
happens that yeah that comes out using
 

00:07:49.589 --> 00:07:51.799
happens that yeah that comes out using
this definition where we take those

00:07:51.799 --> 00:07:51.809
this definition where we take those
 

00:07:51.809 --> 00:07:54.199
this definition where we take those
midpoints so the fact that the floating

00:07:54.199 --> 00:07:54.209
midpoints so the fact that the floating
 

00:07:54.209 --> 00:07:57.409
midpoints so the fact that the floating
body is not convex is fine it's just not

00:07:57.409 --> 00:07:57.419
body is not convex is fine it's just not
 

00:07:57.419 --> 00:07:59.419
body is not convex is fine it's just not
good for you it's just not good for our

00:07:59.419 --> 00:07:59.429
good for you it's just not good for our
 

00:07:59.429 --> 00:08:02.329
good for you it's just not good for our
purposes for the purpose we want to use

00:08:02.329 --> 00:08:02.339
purposes for the purpose we want to use
 

00:08:02.339 --> 00:08:04.699
purposes for the purpose we want to use

bother about taking any midpoints we
 

00:09:36.560 --> 00:09:39.880
bother about taking any midpoints we
just chop off Delta and then we'll look

00:09:39.880 --> 00:09:39.890
just chop off Delta and then we'll look
 

00:09:39.890 --> 00:09:42.190
just chop off Delta and then we'll look
at what is left after we have chopped

00:09:42.190 --> 00:09:42.200
at what is left after we have chopped
 

00:09:42.200 --> 00:09:45.700
at what is left after we have chopped
off Delta and what is left is a convex

volume then if you rotate this thing

00:10:18.970 --> 00:10:18.980
volume then if you rotate this thing
 

00:10:18.980 --> 00:10:23.470
volume then if you rotate this thing
around then the same volume it would be

00:10:23.470 --> 00:10:23.480
around then the same volume it would be
 

00:10:23.480 --> 00:10:25.270
around then the same volume it would be
the same equal volume above the water

00:10:25.270 --> 00:10:25.280
the same equal volume above the water
 

00:10:25.280 --> 00:10:29.260
the same equal volume above the water
surface and the floating body is just

00:10:29.260 --> 00:10:29.270
surface and the floating body is just
 

00:10:29.270 --> 00:10:31.780
surface and the floating body is just
that part that remains always under

that part that remains always under
 

00:10:31.790 --> 00:10:35.380
that part that remains always under
water so it never got to breathe or it's

something that always stays wet if you

00:10:37.870 --> 00:10:37.880
something that always stays wet if you

want so that what we do here will

00:10:39.880 --> 00:10:39.890
want so that what we do here will
 

00:10:39.890 --> 00:10:43.150
want so that what we do here will
construct this wet part so this part the

00:10:43.150 --> 00:10:43.160
construct this wet part so this part the
 

00:10:43.160 --> 00:10:45.580

the points that never got a chance to be
 

00:10:48.800 --> 00:10:52.720
the points that never got a chance to be
in Delta yes so to speak young never got

00:10:52.730 --> 00:10:55.870
in Delta yes so to speak young never got
a chance to be beyond there now if we

00:10:55.870 --> 00:10:55.880
a chance to be beyond there now if we
 

00:10:55.880 --> 00:10:58.270
a chance to be beyond there now if we
want to compare this floating body this

00:10:58.270 --> 00:10:58.280
want to compare this floating body this
 

00:10:58.280 --> 00:11:00.340
want to compare this floating body this
convex floating body with the one that

00:11:00.340 --> 00:11:00.350
convex floating body with the one that
 

00:11:00.350 --> 00:11:03.220
convex floating body with the one that
was given to us by depois then we see

00:11:03.220 --> 00:11:03.230
was given to us by depois then we see
 

00:11:03.230 --> 00:11:08.199
was given to us by depois then we see
that if this dubov floating body

00:11:08.199 --> 00:11:08.209
that if this dubov floating body
 

00:11:08.209 --> 00:11:11.100
that if this dubov floating body
a delta bar we called it is convex then

00:11:11.100 --> 00:11:11.110
a delta bar we called it is convex then
 

00:11:11.110 --> 00:11:14.259
a delta bar we called it is convex then
actually the two coincide then K Delta

00:11:14.259 --> 00:11:14.269
actually the two coincide then K Delta
 

00:11:14.269 --> 00:11:17.319
actually the two coincide then K Delta
is just equal to this K Delta bar so for

00:11:17.319 --> 00:11:17.329
is just equal to this K Delta bar so for
 

00:11:17.329 --> 00:11:21.369
is just equal to this K Delta bar so for
this example of the circle we would just

00:11:21.369 --> 00:11:21.379
this example of the circle we would just
 

00:11:21.379 --> 00:11:23.650
this example of the circle we would just
get the same circle for the example of

00:11:23.650 --> 00:11:23.660
get the same circle for the example of
 

00:11:23.660 --> 00:11:27.069
get the same circle for the example of
the square will just get the same object

00:11:27.069 --> 00:11:27.079
the square will just get the same object
 

00:11:27.079 --> 00:11:29.379
the square will just get the same object
like so and what would we get for the

00:11:29.379 --> 00:11:29.389
like so and what would we get for the
 

00:11:29.389 --> 00:11:32.019
like so and what would we get for the
triangle well for the triangle we don't

00:11:32.019 --> 00:11:32.029
triangle well for the triangle we don't
 

00:11:32.029 --> 00:11:35.350
triangle well for the triangle we don't
have that this dupa floating bodies

00:11:35.350 --> 00:11:35.360
have that this dupa floating bodies
 

00:11:35.360 --> 00:11:37.989
have that this dupa floating bodies
convex but this convex floating bodies

00:11:37.989 --> 00:11:37.999
convex but this convex floating bodies
 

00:11:37.999 --> 00:11:40.030
convex but this convex floating bodies
convex and what we'll get is simply

00:11:40.030 --> 00:11:40.040

these things here without these strange
 

00:11:43.220 --> 00:11:46.569
these things here without these strange
parts so that would be our convex

00:11:46.569 --> 00:11:46.579
parts so that would be our convex
 

00:11:46.579 --> 00:11:48.939
parts so that would be our convex
floating body for the triangle and for

00:11:48.939 --> 00:11:48.949
floating body for the triangle and for
 

00:11:48.949 --> 00:11:54.720

00:12:09.640 --> 00:12:09.650
 

00:12:09.650 --> 00:12:12.070
so there's a convex floating body but

00:12:12.070 --> 00:12:12.080
so there's a convex floating body but
 

00:12:12.080 --> 00:12:13.570
so there's a convex floating body but
