00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:03.930
The final application of technology
in the home that we'll discuss

00:00:03.930 --> 00:00:06.200
is virtual home visits.

00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:10.900
Once expensive, video conferencing
is now available on virtually

00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:15.160
any computer device,
including smartphones and tablet's.

00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:19.350
So direct interaction between a patient
at home and a professional or

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:23.600
other caregiver can be inexpensive and
relatively simple to achieve.

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:28.580
However, this application
is not without controversy.

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:32.580
Some state medical boards take a dim
view of physicians treating patients

00:00:32.580 --> 00:00:35.600
over the Internet,
if they have not previously

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:38.900
physically seen that patient
in person in their office.
