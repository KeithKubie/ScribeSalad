Scientists, you know, those guys that define
our society in the shadows, have recently

00:00:03.930 --> 00:00:07.890
performed a study that’s come to the conclusion
that the human brain judges the trustworthiness

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:10.530
of person based on their facial features.

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:11.790
Dope.

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:21.020
Hey Guys, I’m Will from Sourcefed, guest
hosting for DNews.

00:00:21.020 --> 00:00:24.609
Researchers here in the US, the place that
loves faces more than anywhere else, we invented

00:00:24.609 --> 00:00:28.779
instagram, have found that brain activity
changes in response to how trustworthy a person

00:00:28.779 --> 00:00:31.620
looks, based on just a fleeting look at their
face.

00:00:31.620 --> 00:00:35.719
Coincidentally, they found out more information
leading to why humans make certain preconceived

00:00:35.719 --> 00:00:36.719
judgments.

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:39.969
The research found that portions of our brain
are doing more subconscious work than previously

00:00:39.969 --> 00:00:40.969
thought.

00:00:40.969 --> 00:00:43.989
I just thought hot girls were hot, it turns
out my brain is smarter than me.

00:00:43.989 --> 00:00:48.399
Jonathan Freeman from New York University,
resident smart-man stated “we form spontaneous

00:00:48.399 --> 00:00:51.609
judgments of other people that can be largely
outside awareness.”

00:00:51.609 --> 00:00:55.339
Which is how smart people say, “sometimes
our brains are mean and sometimes not.”

00:00:55.339 --> 00:00:59.069
The study published in the Journal of Neuroscience
focused largely on the actions of the amygdala,

00:00:59.069 --> 00:01:01.409
the small almond shaped part deep inside your
brain.

00:01:01.409 --> 00:01:05.030
I google imaged it and it’s kind of gross
as is everything inside of your body but fun

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:06.030
to learn about!

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:10.049
The amygdala plays a role in processing strong
emotions, so every time that Starbucks barista

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:13.729
gave you a chai tea latte with soy instead
of skim milk, that’s what’s been making

00:01:13.729 --> 00:01:16.590
you feel that way.

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:20.229
Before the study, Freeman asked a group of
individuals to rate whether they trusted certain

00:01:20.229 --> 00:01:21.549
individuals based on their faces.

00:01:21.549 --> 00:01:24.200
Which I like to call High School orientation.

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:27.380
People surprisingly tended to agree on which
faces were trustworthy or not.

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:31.570
Apparently faces with several key features
like furrowed eyebrows and shallower cheekbones

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:34.000
are consistently rated as less trustworthy.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:37.170
So basically, nobody trusts Benedict Cumberbatch.

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:41.510
Another group was instructed to lay in an
MRI scanner while they saw faces flash on

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:42.510
a screen.

00:01:42.510 --> 00:01:44.109
Each face only flashed for milliseconds.

00:01:44.109 --> 00:01:46.659
Which is more than enough time for me personally
to judge someone.

00:01:46.659 --> 00:01:48.780
Just tell me a dudes name and I’m already
mad.

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:52.499
But even though their eyes had small glimpses
of the images, they still were unaware they’d

00:01:52.499 --> 00:01:53.890
seen the faces.

00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:57.859
Even because of this, the amygdala still responded
differently to trustworthy and untrustworthy

00:01:57.859 --> 00:01:58.859
faces.

00:01:58.859 --> 00:02:01.439
That means our brains are quicker at judging
than our eyes are.

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:05.420
Freeman also proposed that the biggest question
of the study is whether or not the brain activity

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:07.759
somehow altered how people behave.

00:02:07.759 --> 00:02:10.830
He stated, “even though people might not
have conscious awareness, they might move

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:14.879
back very subtly when perceiving an untrustworthy
face, but that is still unknown.”

00:02:14.879 --> 00:02:16.900
Apparently Freeman was never a freshman in
High School.

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:17.900
What do you guys think?

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:20.510
Have you ever looked at someone and loved
them just because?

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:21.560
Let me know in the comments down below!

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:25.849
And if you trust my face, you can see more
of it over at Sourcefed.

00:02:25.849 --> 00:02:26.569
Thanks for watching.
