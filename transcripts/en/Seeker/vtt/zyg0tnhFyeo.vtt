This episode of Dnews is brought to you by
Ting: Mobile that makes sense.

00:00:03.520 --> 00:00:07.830
Science says our smartphones are a reflection
of ourselves.

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:14.090
So what does it mean if I've dropped mine
in the toilet 3 times?

00:00:14.090 --> 00:00:21.869
Hey guys, Tara here for Dnews - and I've said
it before, I'll say it again: Everything is

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:23.019
disgusting.

00:00:23.019 --> 00:00:24.470
Especially your cellphone.

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:27.240
It's like a tiny bacteria delivery device.

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:31.499
And a new study shows that those bacteria
- are indeed a reflection of you.

00:00:31.499 --> 00:00:35.840
A group of researchers from the University
of Oregon, sequenced microbes from the index

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:41.180
fingers and thumbs of 17 subjects, as well
as microbes from the surface of their smartphone

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:42.460
touchscreens.

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:47.170
The goal was to see if our favorite and most
widely used possessions resemble us, microbially

00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:48.170
speaking.

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:49.810
And it turns out - they do.

00:00:49.810 --> 00:00:54.660
Researchers found that 82% of the most common
bacteria found on the subjects' fingers - were

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:56.920
also present on their phones.

00:00:56.920 --> 00:01:00.570
Meaning your personal microbiome - which is
the specific collection of bacteria that's

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:04.580
unique to every person - closely resembles
the bacteria on your phone.

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:10.460
The three most commonly found ones were Streptococcus,
Staphylococcus, and Corynebacterium, which

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:15.359
is a mostly harmless bacteria that lives on
human skin - but has been known to cause diptheria,

00:01:15.359 --> 00:01:17.409
an upper respiratory tract illness.

00:01:17.409 --> 00:01:21.749
Interestingly, they also found that women
seem to share more microbial similarity with

00:01:21.749 --> 00:01:23.749
their phones - than men do.

00:01:23.749 --> 00:01:26.220
Although there's no current explanation on
why that may be.

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:30.380
Now it's kind of obvious that our cell phones
would match us, since most of us are glued

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:34.630
to them all day long - but the study does
have some interesting implications.

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:39.170
Specifically, it paves the way for potentially
using someone's personal effects as a means

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:41.049
of monitoring their health.

00:01:41.049 --> 00:01:46.049
Not only is it non-invasive, it doesn't really
require direct participation from the person.

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:50.659
Meaning it could be a fast - and easy way
- to conduct large-scale microbial studies,

00:01:50.659 --> 00:01:55.479
analyze our exposure to biological threats,
or screen the microbes of hospital and healthcare

00:01:55.479 --> 00:01:56.479
workers.

00:01:56.479 --> 00:02:01.380
Currently, 1 in every 20 patients at a healthcare
facility, will contract a hospital-acquired

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:03.249
infection at some point.

00:02:03.249 --> 00:02:07.369
So being able to screen those people - and
their caretakers - could prevent the spread

00:02:07.369 --> 00:02:09.920
of disease, as well as thousands of hospital-related
deaths.

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:11.830
Sounds like a pretty good deal!

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:16.010
And speaking of good deals, if you do have
a cell phone - which of course you do, cause

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:18.010
it's 2014 - then you gotta check out Ting.

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:23.720

the power back in your hands, AND saves you

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:24.720

And you only pay the data and minutes you
actually use.

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:32.610
A novel concept!

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:33.610
But a good one.
