greater disconnect between subjectivity

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:54.780
greater disconnect between subjectivity
 

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:57.340
greater disconnect between subjectivity

00:01:57.340 --> 00:01:57.350
and objectivity okay so that's my
 

00:01:57.350 --> 00:02:00.410
and objectivity okay so that's my
paradigm I mean my agenda I try to

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:00.420

the forked tongues because they always
did something entirely different from

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:12.120
did something entirely different from
 

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:13.290
did something entirely different from
what happened

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:13.300
what happened
 

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:15.810
what happened
now this situation is now finished

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:15.820
now this situation is now finished
 

00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:19.050
now this situation is now finished
because of ecological crisis the

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:19.060
because of ecological crisis the
 

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:20.580
because of ecological crisis the
disconnect at least the disconnect is

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:20.590
disconnect at least the disconnect is
 

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:22.830
disconnect at least the disconnect is
recognized and I think the Copenhagen

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:22.840
recognized and I think the Copenhagen
 

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:25.200
recognized and I think the Copenhagen
event was so interesting for that it's

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:25.210
event was so interesting for that it's
 

00:02:25.210 --> 00:02:27.150
event was so interesting for that it's
the end of a certain idea about the

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:27.160
the end of a certain idea about the
 

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:30.000
the end of a certain idea about the
disconnect so it's not subjective

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:30.010
disconnect so it's not subjective
 

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:33.720
disconnect so it's not subjective
argument now I mean this is subjective

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:33.730

00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:36.220
it is constructed I hope it's well
 

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:38.010
it is constructed I hope it's well
composed but it's not about subjectivity

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:38.020

that is how could you know it's a very

that is how could you know it's a very
 

00:16:14.490 --> 00:16:17.200
that is how could you know it's a very
simple question how could you know that

know well the first question is the
 

00:16:35.910 --> 00:16:37.610
know well the first question is the
world of modernism I mean of course

00:16:37.610 --> 00:16:37.620

societies or the social have become
modern so to me the question about we

00:30:50.770 --> 00:30:50.780
modern so to me the question about we
 

00:30:50.780 --> 00:30:53.140
modern so to me the question about we
have never become more than at least as

00:30:53.140 --> 00:30:53.150
have never become more than at least as
 

00:30:53.150 --> 00:30:56.410

the spot of the ecological crisis and so

00:43:52.470 --> 00:43:52.480
the spot of the ecological crisis and so
 

00:43:52.480 --> 00:43:55.020
the spot of the ecological crisis and so
my question is if we want to sensitize

00:43:55.020 --> 00:43:55.030
my question is if we want to sensitize
 

00:43:55.030 --> 00:43:58.650

is composed as well how we know about
 

00:44:03.190 --> 00:44:05.670
is composed as well how we know about
ecological crisis what kind of research

00:44:05.670 --> 00:44:05.680
ecological crisis what kind of research
 

00:44:05.680 --> 00:44:07.500
ecological crisis what kind of research
projects are important to engage in and

how do you do that kind of research and
 

00:44:11.400 --> 00:44:14.370
how do you do that kind of research and
because at the same time we have this

00:44:14.370 --> 00:44:14.380
because at the same time we have this
 

00:44:14.380 --> 00:44:17.099

agencies so this is disconnect between

00:52:15.220 --> 00:52:15.230
agencies so this is disconnect between
 

00:52:15.230 --> 00:52:17.950
