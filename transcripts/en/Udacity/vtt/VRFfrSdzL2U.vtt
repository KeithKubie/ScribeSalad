00:00:00.340 --> 00:00:03.760
Sometimes it's hard to remember just how humble, our humble

00:00:03.760 --> 00:00:06.840
beginnings really were. We've used our genome cell to look

00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:09.940
at our close and distant relatives, to discover our countries

00:00:09.940 --> 00:00:13.150
and continents of origin even trace our maternal and paternal lines

00:00:13.150 --> 00:00:15.830
out of Africa. But all we really need to do,

00:00:15.830 --> 00:00:17.460
to see where we've come from, is look at the

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:21.180
genomes of some of our closest living relatives. One of

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:25.790
the best kept genetic secrets, is hiding in your chromosome two.

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:29.550
Now humans have 23 pairs of chromosomes, and chimpanzees

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:32.610
along with our other close primate relatives, like orangutans,

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:37.070
and gorillas, have 24 pairs of chromosomes. Now humans

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:40.680
and chimps are cousins. We share a common ancestor.

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:43.110
Now we've also shared a common habitat in Africa,

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:45.810
for a very long time. We look alike. We

00:00:45.810 --> 00:00:48.480
act alike. And new tools are showing us everyday

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:50.790
how we even think alike but if we're so

00:00:50.790 --> 00:00:53.270
similar to chimpanzees, then why don't we have the

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:57.140
same number of chromosomes? Here's an actual picture, from an

00:00:57.140 --> 00:01:01.450
actual experiment, where somebody used a probe, a label, to

00:01:01.450 --> 00:01:03.980
look in the genome of a human and a great

00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:06.540
ape. These are all the chromosomes and in green

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:09.800
here they've painted the chromosomes that have sequences from our

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:13.150
human chromosome two. And you can see this chromosome lit

00:01:13.150 --> 00:01:15.820
up in green here that's nice and long. And in

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:18.110
the picture of the great ape, we see the

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:20.940
same chromosome lit up in green, because it has

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:23.920
the same sequences but notice that we have twice

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:27.160
as many chromosomes, and they're smaller. If we were to

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:30.060
actually look at the sequence of our chromosome two,

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:34.320
it matches the sequence of two smaller chimp chromosomes. We

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:37.030
can even line them up side by side and

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:41.100
see which of the chimp chromosomes go in which order

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:43.710
for our human chromosome two. Humans and

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:46.450
chimps shared a common ancestor that lived about

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:48.840
six to eight million years ago and this

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:53.900
common ancestor likely had 24 pairs of chromosomes.

00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:56.370
Just like all the other great apes, orangutans,

00:01:56.370 --> 00:01:59.990
gorillas, chimps and then the population was separated

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:03.170
by the Great Rift Valley in East Africa.

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:06.370
Where the population on the west side remained

00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:09.250
in the forest, and evolved as chimps while

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:12.290
the population on the east side was pushed

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:15.390
into the Savannah, and experienced a chromosomal fusion

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:18.620
during the evolution to human. Now you may find

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:22.440
a profound connection to parents and siblings, and

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:25.700
grandparents, and even great grandparents and cousins. But I

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:28.210
hope you take a second, to just sit

00:02:28.210 --> 00:02:31.420
and think and share a deep appreciation for the

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:36.230
connection that you have with your even more distant cousin, the chimpanzee.
