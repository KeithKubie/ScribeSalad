Now that you know what a polynomial is, we're going to talk briefly about a word

00:00:04.987 --> 00:00:09.810
that we use to characterize a given term in a polynomial. The degree of a term.

00:00:09.917 --> 00:00:14.745
Now, the degree of a term is equal to the sum of all the exponents of all of the

00:00:14.757 --> 00:00:19.395
variable that are in that term. So if we have a term like negative 4x cubed,

00:00:19.502 --> 00:00:24.726
then the degree of this term is 3. Since we have an exponent of 3 for the only

00:00:24.738 --> 00:00:30.074
variable that's in the term x. Another way we could say this is that this is a

00:00:30.086 --> 00:00:35.260
3rd degree term. Now if, in contrast, we have a term like 6y to 7th, z to the

00:00:35.272 --> 00:00:40.584
4th, the degree is 11 or we could also say this is a 11th degree term. Now the

00:00:40.596 --> 00:00:45.027
degree is 11 here, because for a first variable we see we have a power of 7 and

00:00:45.039 --> 00:00:49.534
for the second variable we have a power of 4. y and z are the only two variables

00:00:49.546 --> 00:00:54.041
in this expression, so the degree is equal to the sum of their powers, 7 plus 4

00:00:54.053 --> 00:00:54.603
equals 11.
