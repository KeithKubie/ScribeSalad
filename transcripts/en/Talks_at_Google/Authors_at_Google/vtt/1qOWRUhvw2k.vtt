00:00:06.280 --> 00:00:07.780
INTERVIEWER: Hello, everybody.

00:00:07.780 --> 00:00:08.830
Welcome.

00:00:08.830 --> 00:00:13.640
And mostly welcome to Edoardo,
who is here with us today.

00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:16.329
He just shared with
me a very funny story

00:00:16.329 --> 00:00:18.870
of his first
contact with Google.

00:00:18.870 --> 00:00:21.910
So I thought it would be nice
to start by asking him to share

00:00:21.910 --> 00:00:23.920
this story with everyone here.

00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:26.270
EDOARDO NESI: Hello,
thank you for coming.

00:00:26.270 --> 00:00:28.810
I was telling [? Marsha ?] that
the first-- the really first

00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:33.880
time I entered the
internet, I was

00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:36.530
told that I had to
start from Google.

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:39.370
So I wrote Google.

00:00:39.370 --> 00:00:42.850
And then, I saw the
page, the home page.

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:44.920
And I said--

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:45.910
I was afraid.

00:00:45.910 --> 00:00:49.236
Because I said, how much am I
going to pay to make it search?

00:00:49.236 --> 00:00:51.370
[LAUGHTER]

00:00:51.370 --> 00:00:56.680
I was waiting to see somebody
to say $1 for everything.

00:00:56.680 --> 00:01:00.290
So I said-- then I
realized it was not--

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:02.280
yeah, that I didn't have to pay.

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:05.670
And so it was the
start, I mean, the start

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:07.480
of my internet experience.

00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:08.230
INTERVIEWER: Cool.

00:01:08.230 --> 00:01:10.430
Thanks for sharing that.

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:14.400
So we're here today to
talk about your new book.

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:18.250
And while I was reading
it, I really much

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:21.580
enjoyed the style and
especially this conversation

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:23.860
between Eduardo and Guido.

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:26.410
I don't know if the English
edition kind of like

00:01:26.410 --> 00:01:27.760
reflects that as good.

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:29.350
But the Italian is
really interesting.

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:33.482
Because you really capture
two different styles.

00:01:33.482 --> 00:01:37.240
And so here we are having a
textile entrepreneur from Prato

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:38.920
and an economist from Rome.

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:40.520
They're talking to each other.

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:41.936
And one thing that
I was wondering

00:01:41.936 --> 00:01:43.580
is, how did that happen?

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:45.070
What's the genesis of the book?

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:47.350
How did you guys decide
to write a book together?

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:50.890
I can't think of two worlds
more different than that.

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:53.710
EDOARDO NESI: Well,
it's a funny story, too,

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:56.810
because we have common friends.

00:01:56.810 --> 00:02:00.690
And they were in
the movie industry,

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:03.010
kept on telling him that he--

00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:05.050
well, he should meet Edoardo.

00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:07.870
And they kept telling
me, we should meet Guido.

00:02:07.870 --> 00:02:12.051
And so since the start, we said,
we are not going to be friends.

00:02:12.051 --> 00:02:12.550
You know?

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:18.530
And then, he was-- he's
not only an economist.

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:21.760
He is one of the greatest
private equity investors

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:22.840
in Europe.

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:25.060
He has been awarded
two or three times

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:26.690
as the best investor in Europe.

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:28.900
And so I said not really--

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:29.800
not my cup of tea.

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:34.000
And then, I met him.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:37.900
And I found out a
very strange person.

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:41.480
I mean, for all his richness--

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:43.270
because Guido's very rich--

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:47.830
he's always worried about
how things are going

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:50.830
to go for the poorest people.

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:54.370
He is-- well, he's not
here, so I can talk freely.

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:55.370
I mean, he gives--

00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:56.370
[LAUGHTER]

00:02:56.370 --> 00:02:59.320
--he gives a lot of
money to a foundation,

00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:04.900
to his own foundation
that helps children to be

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:09.460
cured of unknown illnesses.

00:03:09.460 --> 00:03:12.295
And he's very Christian.

00:03:12.295 --> 00:03:13.430
He is very devout.

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:15.550
And he's a nice person.

00:03:15.550 --> 00:03:18.700
So when I started to hear
these things about him,

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:22.390
then I said, no, so maybe we
can start becoming friends.

00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:25.450
And when we started
becoming friends,

00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:28.288
we realized that we had--

00:03:28.288 --> 00:03:31.180
we had the problem
with the way things

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:34.390
were going for our country.

00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:39.760
And we shared completely
different beginnings

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:43.900
and completely different works
and futures and destinies.

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:47.390
But we were terribly
worried about the direction

00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:50.290
that Italy was going to be.

00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:53.080
If I can go on, I am--

00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:55.210
I used to be a
textile entrepreneur.

00:03:55.210 --> 00:03:58.450
We-- my family had a
textile business that

00:03:58.450 --> 00:04:02.380
started before the World War.

00:04:02.380 --> 00:04:06.100
And we were making
covers-- you know--

00:04:06.100 --> 00:04:11.419
covers for-- because
at the beginning,

00:04:11.419 --> 00:04:13.710
well, there was no central
heating everywhere in Italy.

00:04:13.710 --> 00:04:17.279
You needed a cover to put on.

00:04:17.279 --> 00:04:19.550
And then, we started
to make fabrics.

00:04:19.550 --> 00:04:23.180
And when we started to make
fabrics, the war broke out,

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:26.330
and the Germans invaded Italy.

00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:30.510
And we had a small company.

00:04:30.510 --> 00:04:35.060
The heart of the
company were four looms.

00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:37.110
The looms were very
big and very slow.

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:38.240
But they were our richness.

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:42.480
So they've always been with us.

00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:46.500
But when the Germans
retired from Italy,

00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:50.880
the very day they left
Prato, my hometown,

00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:53.030
they bombed our looms.

00:04:53.030 --> 00:04:54.990
They made them explode.

00:04:54.990 --> 00:04:58.290
They destroyed them,
as they were destroying

00:04:58.290 --> 00:05:01.360
everything that had
value for the people,

00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:03.030
for the Italian people.

00:05:03.030 --> 00:05:07.350
And so it was a
terrible blow for us.

00:05:07.350 --> 00:05:10.890
I have to say that
in the coming years,

00:05:10.890 --> 00:05:14.100
they helped us to
rebuild the company.

00:05:14.100 --> 00:05:18.000
Because they were making
orders for our fabrics.

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:21.630
And there were very,
very good and very honest

00:05:21.630 --> 00:05:23.597
customers for us.

00:05:23.597 --> 00:05:26.180
But well, the beginning of our
relationship was not that good.

00:05:26.180 --> 00:05:28.710
[CHUCKLES]

00:05:28.710 --> 00:05:30.730
INTERVIEWER: All
right, so thank you.

00:05:30.730 --> 00:05:33.760
This kind of leads into
the next question, which

00:05:33.760 --> 00:05:37.120
is, what is the book about?

00:05:37.120 --> 00:05:39.940
Like, OK, so if
I'm the bookstore,

00:05:39.940 --> 00:05:41.500
and I'm considering
buying this book,

00:05:41.500 --> 00:05:45.710
I'm a prospective reader here,
why should I get this book?

00:05:45.710 --> 00:05:47.830
Why shall I read it,
especially from the point

00:05:47.830 --> 00:05:49.990
of view of a US reader?

00:05:49.990 --> 00:05:52.170
What should be particularly
interesting here?

00:05:52.170 --> 00:05:54.680
EDOARDO NESI: Well,
there are a few reasons.

00:05:54.680 --> 00:06:01.300
One is you get to know how
things went very well and then

00:06:01.300 --> 00:06:04.437
very bad for the
fashion industry,

00:06:04.437 --> 00:06:05.395
for the fashion system.

00:06:08.260 --> 00:06:11.350
Our company, our
textile company,

00:06:11.350 --> 00:06:13.630
was working for the
most important stylists

00:06:13.630 --> 00:06:15.630
in the world.

00:06:15.630 --> 00:06:16.510
You name it.

00:06:16.510 --> 00:06:18.610
I mean, we were working
with all of them.

00:06:18.610 --> 00:06:22.417
And we were delivering good
quality at a good price.

00:06:22.417 --> 00:06:24.750
Because it's very difficult
to work with Giorgio Armani,

00:06:24.750 --> 00:06:25.800
for example.

00:06:25.800 --> 00:06:29.520
Because Giorgio Armani,
he makes personally

00:06:29.520 --> 00:06:33.810
the choices of the fabrics,
because he's a very--

00:06:33.810 --> 00:06:37.950
he doesn't-- he doesn't leave
a lot of space to his people.

00:06:37.950 --> 00:06:39.140
But he's extremely good.

00:06:39.140 --> 00:06:41.820
He's one of the few
stylists that really

00:06:41.820 --> 00:06:44.630
knows something about fabrics.

00:06:44.630 --> 00:06:46.250
And so we-- I mean,
we were working

00:06:46.250 --> 00:06:49.560
at the highest level, in a way.

00:06:49.560 --> 00:06:51.880
We were doing
fabrics for coating,

00:06:51.880 --> 00:06:56.200
for jackets, and
not only in wool--

00:06:56.200 --> 00:07:00.030
linen, cotton, everything.

00:07:00.030 --> 00:07:01.885
We were very good.

00:07:01.885 --> 00:07:02.760
This I want to state.

00:07:02.760 --> 00:07:09.810
Because every time we discuss
how Italian textile system went

00:07:09.810 --> 00:07:13.770
down, went to almost
bankruptcy, there is always

00:07:13.770 --> 00:07:14.990
the problem with competition.

00:07:14.990 --> 00:07:16.650
We didn't hold onto competition.

00:07:16.650 --> 00:07:18.820
We couldn't face competition.

00:07:18.820 --> 00:07:22.890
But it's a bit more
difficult to say.

00:07:22.890 --> 00:07:24.590
It's different.

00:07:24.590 --> 00:07:27.840
It is another kind of
competition then, maybe--

00:07:27.840 --> 00:07:31.530
we'll go on with this.

00:07:31.530 --> 00:07:33.040
So this one is the reason.

00:07:33.040 --> 00:07:35.980
The second reason is why Italy
is not what it used to be.

00:07:35.980 --> 00:07:39.420
It's not anymore
what it used to be--

00:07:39.420 --> 00:07:43.230
how everything really
lost meaning and sense

00:07:43.230 --> 00:07:46.140
in the production of well being.

00:07:46.140 --> 00:07:49.650
Whatever happens in the United
States always affects Italy.

00:07:49.650 --> 00:07:54.690
And the beginning of the book
is the Millennium celebration

00:07:54.690 --> 00:07:56.820
by Bill Clinton in Washington.

00:07:56.820 --> 00:07:59.250
And the end of the book
is the inaugural speech

00:07:59.250 --> 00:08:00.920
of Donald Trump.

00:08:00.920 --> 00:08:05.616
And the book tells also
the story of what--

00:08:05.616 --> 00:08:10.320
of everything that happened
in the financial world

00:08:10.320 --> 00:08:15.320
in those years and how the--

00:08:15.320 --> 00:08:20.310
and how the-- all the
crises were faced in Europe

00:08:20.310 --> 00:08:21.480
and in the United States.

00:08:21.480 --> 00:08:27.010
I mean, it's a small
book, but it has inside

00:08:27.010 --> 00:08:31.380
two stories which could not
be more different than one

00:08:31.380 --> 00:08:32.370
from the other.

00:08:32.370 --> 00:08:34.890
So I am the loser in the story.

00:08:34.890 --> 00:08:36.998
And Guido is the winner.

00:08:36.998 --> 00:08:38.039
I don't like to say that.

00:08:38.039 --> 00:08:39.620
I mean, it's about--

00:08:39.620 --> 00:08:44.159
it's how the Italian publisher
kept on talking about the book.

00:08:44.159 --> 00:08:46.170
So at the end of the
book, I said maybe--

00:08:46.170 --> 00:08:47.730
maybe that's the story.

00:08:47.730 --> 00:08:49.710
Because I lost my
textile company.

00:08:49.710 --> 00:08:54.540
And Guido is still one of
the most important investors

00:08:54.540 --> 00:08:57.030
in Europe.

00:08:57.030 --> 00:09:01.830
Another reason why you should
probably read this book

00:09:01.830 --> 00:09:05.340
is that we discuss about
fast fashion, which

00:09:05.340 --> 00:09:08.010
is this terrible
phenomenon that you

00:09:08.010 --> 00:09:13.230
go through all these giants,
like Zara and the H&amp;M.

00:09:13.230 --> 00:09:15.390
And you go there, and
you buy something.

00:09:15.390 --> 00:09:20.070
And you think that it's fashion,
because it looks like fashion.

00:09:20.070 --> 00:09:22.020
It has the right colors.

00:09:22.020 --> 00:09:25.980
If you see things
from 10 meters away,

00:09:25.980 --> 00:09:31.500
it's a perfect imitation of what
fashion should look like today.

00:09:31.500 --> 00:09:33.612
INTERVIEWER: I'm
wearing a Zara jacket.

00:09:33.612 --> 00:09:34.908
EDOARDO NESI: Ah!

00:09:34.908 --> 00:09:36.210
[LAUGHTER]

00:09:36.210 --> 00:09:36.842
I forgive you.

00:09:36.842 --> 00:09:37.800
INTERVIEWER: Thank you.

00:09:37.800 --> 00:09:40.020
[LAUGHTER]

00:09:40.020 --> 00:09:43.360
EDOARDO NESI: But then,
well, let me tell the story.

00:09:43.360 --> 00:09:45.190
One of these giants--

00:09:45.190 --> 00:09:50.380
my daughter Angelica,
when she was very young,

00:09:50.380 --> 00:09:51.350
she wanted to go there.

00:09:51.350 --> 00:09:54.010
She said, babbo, you
have to take me there.

00:09:54.010 --> 00:09:56.220
And when she says
this, I always do.

00:09:56.220 --> 00:09:59.230
I mean, everything,
whatever she wants, I do.

00:09:59.230 --> 00:10:02.390
So I even went into
this-- into the shop.

00:10:02.390 --> 00:10:05.020
It was a fantastic
experience for me.

00:10:05.020 --> 00:10:07.750
Because they came to us.

00:10:07.750 --> 00:10:09.550
They wanted to buy our fabrics.

00:10:09.550 --> 00:10:12.400
And they said, the
fabric is fantastic.

00:10:12.400 --> 00:10:16.450
But we could not pay
15 euros per meter.

00:10:16.450 --> 00:10:17.890
We can pay seven.

00:10:17.890 --> 00:10:21.680
So do a seven euro
version of this fabric.

00:10:21.680 --> 00:10:23.170
I said, this is impossible.

00:10:23.170 --> 00:10:24.870
I mean, you're
choosing cashmere,

00:10:24.870 --> 00:10:26.237
just to make an example.

00:10:26.237 --> 00:10:27.820
And you want cashmere
for seven euros.

00:10:27.820 --> 00:10:29.091
It's impossible.

00:10:29.091 --> 00:10:29.590
OK.

00:10:29.590 --> 00:10:34.120
So just to give you an idea of
how dealing with these people

00:10:34.120 --> 00:10:35.040
works.

00:10:35.040 --> 00:10:36.790
So we entered the shop,
and we see things.

00:10:36.790 --> 00:10:38.680
And the shop is fantastic.

00:10:38.680 --> 00:10:39.790
The music is fantastic.

00:10:39.790 --> 00:10:43.050
The sales people were very good.

00:10:43.050 --> 00:10:47.020
And then, you see the
stuff from 15 meters.

00:10:47.020 --> 00:10:48.400
And you say, oh, it's good.

00:10:48.400 --> 00:10:49.650
The colors are very good.

00:10:49.650 --> 00:10:52.480
The buttons are--
and then, every step

00:10:52.480 --> 00:10:57.825
you do, towards the
jacket or toward the coat,

00:10:57.825 --> 00:10:59.200
you see there is
something wrong.

00:10:59.200 --> 00:11:04.660
And then you touch it, and then
you see what the problem is.

00:11:04.660 --> 00:11:08.080
But then you realize
that you are already

00:11:08.080 --> 00:11:14.260
inside the idea of
blackmailing yourself.

00:11:14.260 --> 00:11:15.140
Because you go there.

00:11:15.140 --> 00:11:21.120
You say, this is a jacket,
and it costs 39 euro and 99.

00:11:21.120 --> 00:11:24.540
Also, this thing-- you know?

00:11:24.540 --> 00:11:27.290
39.99-- if you go
to another shop

00:11:27.290 --> 00:11:31.550
and you buy something
better, it is 100 euro.

00:11:31.550 --> 00:11:33.940
And then you say, I don't know.

00:11:33.940 --> 00:11:36.370
Maybe I should save this
and have the same thing.

00:11:36.370 --> 00:11:37.930
I mean, it's not as good--

00:11:37.930 --> 00:11:39.800
I know it's not as good.

00:11:39.800 --> 00:11:42.040
But it will work.

00:11:42.040 --> 00:11:46.250
And it usually does for
two weeks, for three weeks.

00:11:46.250 --> 00:11:47.750
The fourth week
you have it, then

00:11:47.750 --> 00:11:51.540
you start to see button
losing, and there is a problem.

00:11:51.540 --> 00:11:55.650
And then whenever you
wash it, you know.

00:11:55.650 --> 00:11:57.810
I think you have
the same experience.

00:11:57.810 --> 00:11:58.860
You realized it.

00:12:01.590 --> 00:12:08.530
And then, you see how this
phenomenon really works on you.

00:12:08.530 --> 00:12:09.970
You decide what to do.

00:12:09.970 --> 00:12:13.870
You trick yourself in believing
that you are saving money.

00:12:13.870 --> 00:12:20.350
But then, you start to realize
that Zara, for example,

00:12:20.350 --> 00:12:26.020
is growing bigger and
bigger every year.

00:12:26.020 --> 00:12:27.760
And his owner is
one of the most--

00:12:27.760 --> 00:12:29.430
well, the richest
person in the country.

00:12:29.430 --> 00:12:33.300
So somebody is
buying these things.

00:12:33.300 --> 00:12:35.280
So you are not saving that much.

00:12:35.280 --> 00:12:38.400
Because there is research
that says that, for example,

00:12:38.400 --> 00:12:43.590
in Great Britain, every 20
days, you buy something.

00:12:43.590 --> 00:12:46.230
So at the end of the year,
you've spent a lot of money

00:12:46.230 --> 00:12:49.530
on things that are not
as good enough as you

00:12:49.530 --> 00:12:52.060
should-- they should be.

00:12:52.060 --> 00:12:55.870
It's the idea that
whenever you buy something,

00:12:55.870 --> 00:12:58.690
you forget about the price.

00:12:58.690 --> 00:13:02.820
And then you forget about
even that you bought it.

00:13:02.820 --> 00:13:07.710
Because their fantastic system
is such that every week,

00:13:07.710 --> 00:13:09.540
there is a new collection.

00:13:09.540 --> 00:13:10.270
And it's real.

00:13:10.270 --> 00:13:12.650
It's true.

00:13:12.650 --> 00:13:15.320
Whatever they don't
sell, they discard.

00:13:15.320 --> 00:13:17.080
It's sent away.

00:13:17.080 --> 00:13:18.590
You know where.

00:13:18.590 --> 00:13:21.080
Well, if you look at
the true cost, which

00:13:21.080 --> 00:13:22.940
is the very interesting
documentary that

00:13:22.940 --> 00:13:28.014
was made by Andrew Morgan,
you see where it ends up--

00:13:28.014 --> 00:13:29.430
in the poorest
country where there

00:13:29.430 --> 00:13:32.540
are mountains of
these discarded things

00:13:32.540 --> 00:13:36.000
that were bought
and thrown away.

00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:38.190
Or even they were unsold,
and so they were--

00:13:38.190 --> 00:13:40.030
they followed the same destiny.

00:13:40.030 --> 00:13:43.800
But they maybe went
into another way.

00:13:43.800 --> 00:13:46.290
But this is one of the reasons
you should read the book,

00:13:46.290 --> 00:13:47.640
because we discussed this.

00:13:47.640 --> 00:13:50.025
And I know the subject.

00:13:53.010 --> 00:13:56.350
Well, it's a sad story,
but I know the subject.

00:13:56.350 --> 00:13:57.840
INTERVIEWER: Well, thank you.

00:13:57.840 --> 00:14:01.110
So one of the most revealing
moments of the book for me

00:14:01.110 --> 00:14:04.830
was the explanation that
quantitative easing,

00:14:04.830 --> 00:14:09.420
that somehow worked in the US,
didn't really work in Italy.

00:14:09.420 --> 00:14:12.750
And essentially, the money
stopped at the banks, right?

00:14:12.750 --> 00:14:15.390
And it connected with the
thought that I always had was

00:14:15.390 --> 00:14:18.390
how much easier it is
to borrow money here

00:14:18.390 --> 00:14:20.400
with respect to Italy.

00:14:20.400 --> 00:14:23.370
So it's always been shocking.

00:14:23.370 --> 00:14:26.880
And I was wondering,
do you and Guido

00:14:26.880 --> 00:14:30.900
think that there could have
been a way to actually make

00:14:30.900 --> 00:14:32.880
it work in Italy?

00:14:32.880 --> 00:14:36.570
EDOARDO NESI: Well, Guido
could answer better than me

00:14:36.570 --> 00:14:37.410
to this question.

00:14:37.410 --> 00:14:40.870
But anyway, the
problem is this--

00:14:40.870 --> 00:14:44.730
quantitative easing was made
by the European Central Bank

00:14:44.730 --> 00:14:47.070
to save easily Italy
from a terrible crisis.

00:14:47.070 --> 00:14:50.740
You will remember that
Greece was in crisis.

00:14:50.740 --> 00:14:53.550
And together with Greece,
after a few months,

00:14:53.550 --> 00:14:56.670
Italy went in a
financial crisis so bad

00:14:56.670 --> 00:15:00.930
that the spread between our
bonds and the German bonds

00:15:00.930 --> 00:15:03.480
kept on rising.

00:15:03.480 --> 00:15:06.360
And it had become
almost impossible

00:15:06.360 --> 00:15:09.210
for the federal government
to issue new bonds,

00:15:09.210 --> 00:15:11.370
because they were so
expensive that we should have

00:15:11.370 --> 00:15:15.900
been bankrupt if that
phenomena could go on

00:15:15.900 --> 00:15:17.370
for months and months.

00:15:17.370 --> 00:15:23.050
So the European Bank
made the right decision.

00:15:23.050 --> 00:15:26.080
The problem is that
we are in Europe.

00:15:26.080 --> 00:15:32.260
And we love to think that we
are a big, single community

00:15:32.260 --> 00:15:33.880
of different states.

00:15:33.880 --> 00:15:36.990
The problem is that
we are very different,

00:15:36.990 --> 00:15:43.540
and that Germany is so strong,
has such a strong economy,

00:15:43.540 --> 00:15:52.070
such a strong state, that
sometimes the European politics

00:15:52.070 --> 00:15:55.420
trying to help the poorest
country, like Greece,

00:15:55.420 --> 00:16:01.150
like Portugal, like Italy,
like Spain, well, that hurts

00:16:01.150 --> 00:16:02.330
the interest of Germany.

00:16:02.330 --> 00:16:06.730
And so it's very difficult
to [INAUDIBLE] in a way

00:16:06.730 --> 00:16:09.090
that everything is
good for everybody.

00:16:11.650 --> 00:16:13.250
So we went into this--

00:16:13.250 --> 00:16:14.770
the quantitative easing.

00:16:14.770 --> 00:16:18.460
And the European Central
Bank started to create money,

00:16:18.460 --> 00:16:22.430
to print money,
and to buy bonds.

00:16:22.430 --> 00:16:24.910
But if you buy bonds from the
state, you help the state.

00:16:24.910 --> 00:16:28.690
But this money, which is
billions and billions of euro

00:16:28.690 --> 00:16:32.580
every month, it stops there.

00:16:32.580 --> 00:16:33.780
It doesn't go to the people.

00:16:33.780 --> 00:16:35.800
And it doesn't go
to the business.

00:16:35.800 --> 00:16:37.920
It doesn't go to the
private companies.

00:16:37.920 --> 00:16:41.260
And so there is a huge
creation of money.

00:16:41.260 --> 00:16:43.140
And it doesn't go to the people.

00:16:43.140 --> 00:16:45.450
And that's how it
works in Italy,

00:16:45.450 --> 00:16:51.070
which is crazy, because
not going to the people--

00:16:51.070 --> 00:16:53.290
the voters, for example,
they do not even

00:16:53.290 --> 00:16:55.900
know that-- what is
going on in Italy.

00:16:58.790 --> 00:17:00.490
What happened in
the States, I think,

00:17:00.490 --> 00:17:06.460
is that whenever an economy
is based on consumption,

00:17:06.460 --> 00:17:09.010
everything goes to the
consumer, because it's

00:17:09.010 --> 00:17:10.810
interest for everybody.

00:17:10.810 --> 00:17:12.910
In Italy, it didn't work out.

00:17:12.910 --> 00:17:17.680
So we were inundated with money.

00:17:17.680 --> 00:17:20.801
And we didn't see even
a single drop of it.

00:17:20.801 --> 00:17:21.550
INTERVIEWER: Yeah.

00:17:21.550 --> 00:17:23.430
That's kind of crazy
to think about it.

00:17:23.430 --> 00:17:23.930
Yeah.

00:17:23.930 --> 00:17:24.971
EDOARDO NESI: It's crazy.

00:17:24.971 --> 00:17:25.490
It's crazy.

00:17:25.490 --> 00:17:30.030
Because that ocean of
money really saved us

00:17:30.030 --> 00:17:32.230
but saved the state.

00:17:32.230 --> 00:17:38.090
In Italy, we are not so
sure that we are the state.

00:17:38.090 --> 00:17:41.900
In Italy, we try to think that
the individual are one thing,

00:17:41.900 --> 00:17:43.670
and the state is another--

00:17:43.670 --> 00:17:50.330
very often in a fight, in
a cruel fight between them.

00:17:50.330 --> 00:17:54.380
And so I think I--

00:17:54.380 --> 00:17:56.567
did I answer the question?

00:17:56.567 --> 00:17:58.400
INTERVIEWER: I'm still
just wondering, like,

00:17:58.400 --> 00:18:02.270
was there actually a
way to make it work?

00:18:02.270 --> 00:18:04.530
Was there a
possibility of getting

00:18:04.530 --> 00:18:06.780
this money to the people
rather than stop at the bank?

00:18:06.780 --> 00:18:09.071
EDOARDO NESI: This is the
question that is in the book.

00:18:09.071 --> 00:18:10.100
And I asked Guido that.

00:18:10.100 --> 00:18:12.140
So why is it so?

00:18:12.140 --> 00:18:13.860
Why don't you help the economy?

00:18:13.860 --> 00:18:18.320
Why don't you make it
possible for small companies

00:18:18.320 --> 00:18:22.070
or for a small
business to have money

00:18:22.070 --> 00:18:26.780
and to invest, to
buy new machines,

00:18:26.780 --> 00:18:29.750
and to hire more people?

00:18:29.750 --> 00:18:33.370
And he said that the Germans
are afraid of inflation,

00:18:33.370 --> 00:18:37.830
which is funny, because
inflation is nothing in Italy.

00:18:37.830 --> 00:18:43.200
And it has been nothing in whole
Europe for years and years.

00:18:43.200 --> 00:18:45.490
But they are afraid
it could grow up.

00:18:48.020 --> 00:18:50.070
You know, I have a
different approach to this.

00:18:50.070 --> 00:18:52.610
Because when I was
young and Italy

00:18:52.610 --> 00:18:57.750
was growing at the same rhythm
that China is growing now,

00:18:57.750 --> 00:19:01.160
which is 7% per year--

00:19:01.160 --> 00:19:04.570
in those years,
inflation is very high.

00:19:04.570 --> 00:19:12.750
And so I grew up in a time and
in a place and in a country

00:19:12.750 --> 00:19:16.141
where inflation has been
up-- you remember probably--

00:19:16.141 --> 00:19:16.890
INTERVIEWER: I do.

00:19:16.890 --> 00:19:19.080
EDOARDO NESI: --of more
than 10% every year.

00:19:19.080 --> 00:19:21.330
And everything was going
on, was going perfectly.

00:19:21.330 --> 00:19:24.370
So I'm not Guido.

00:19:24.370 --> 00:19:27.240
Guido would be here--

00:19:27.240 --> 00:19:29.020
would be perfect to
answer this question.

00:19:29.020 --> 00:19:31.860
But I still think that a
little bit of inflation

00:19:31.860 --> 00:19:35.150
is not very bad for a country.

00:19:35.150 --> 00:19:37.620
INTERVIEWER: Well, I'm going
to switch a little bit here

00:19:37.620 --> 00:19:41.010
and get maybe a little
bit closer to me

00:19:41.010 --> 00:19:42.070
and to this audience.

00:19:42.070 --> 00:19:45.690
So in the late
'90s or early 2000,

00:19:45.690 --> 00:19:48.120
while you and many
other people in Italy

00:19:48.120 --> 00:19:50.700
were sort of sinking with
the boats, we got out.

00:19:50.700 --> 00:19:55.530
We took our wonderfully publicly
paid education from Italy

00:19:55.530 --> 00:19:57.960
and came to the US, where
we thought we were going

00:19:57.960 --> 00:20:00.310
to get more possibilities.

00:20:00.310 --> 00:20:02.370
It's known under the
name of "brain drain."

00:20:02.370 --> 00:20:06.060
And there's been a
lot of talk about it.

00:20:06.060 --> 00:20:11.370
And a few of us went back,
but most of us stayed here.

00:20:11.370 --> 00:20:13.470
Are we guilty, or
are we innocent?

00:20:13.470 --> 00:20:15.670
What could we do
to give back now?

00:20:15.670 --> 00:20:17.915
And why didn't you
make a similar choice?

00:20:17.915 --> 00:20:20.040
EDOARDO NESI: Well, let's
start with the beginning.

00:20:20.040 --> 00:20:22.800
You are innocent, and
you are making honor

00:20:22.800 --> 00:20:28.440
to our country being here and
working as good as you are.

00:20:28.440 --> 00:20:31.320
I mean, this is
extremely important

00:20:31.320 --> 00:20:34.920
that the Italian image
is defended abroad

00:20:34.920 --> 00:20:38.820
by people like you, or
many other people that

00:20:38.820 --> 00:20:41.970
maybe are here, and they come
from different countries.

00:20:41.970 --> 00:20:44.280
But in Italy, it is
even more important,

00:20:44.280 --> 00:20:48.500
because the brain drain we had--

00:20:48.500 --> 00:20:50.170
well, it's still going on.

00:20:50.170 --> 00:20:54.390
Well, it's accelerating,
as a matter of fact.

00:20:54.390 --> 00:20:56.460
But there is nothing you can do.

00:20:56.460 --> 00:21:01.260
You have to make your own
choices, your best choices.

00:21:01.260 --> 00:21:02.500
And then you have--

00:21:02.500 --> 00:21:05.090
the problem is that
we live in a system

00:21:05.090 --> 00:21:09.630
and in a country that not only
allows this but encourages

00:21:09.630 --> 00:21:11.060
this.

00:21:11.060 --> 00:21:13.090
We are encouraged to go out.

00:21:13.090 --> 00:21:17.480
I mean, my son is studying
contemporary art in London.

00:21:17.480 --> 00:21:20.270
My daughter is studying now
in Milan at the Polytechnical.

00:21:20.270 --> 00:21:22.730
But in the next
few years, she will

00:21:22.730 --> 00:21:27.530
start master's somewhere--
maybe in California, maybe

00:21:27.530 --> 00:21:29.990
in England.

00:21:29.990 --> 00:21:32.140
You have to go out.

00:21:32.140 --> 00:21:35.720
This is not anymore
the time where

00:21:35.720 --> 00:21:41.730
you can live a working
career in your country.

00:21:41.730 --> 00:21:43.490
Let me say one little thing.

00:21:43.490 --> 00:21:48.950
You know, my hometown,
Prato, it was and still

00:21:48.950 --> 00:21:54.480
is the biggest textile center
in Europe, even in production

00:21:54.480 --> 00:21:56.030
and in quality.

00:21:56.030 --> 00:22:00.130
And it was possible that if
you wanted to make textile,

00:22:00.130 --> 00:22:03.960
if you wanted to make
fashion, living in Prato

00:22:03.960 --> 00:22:05.690
all your career was a--

00:22:05.690 --> 00:22:07.020
was a fantastic choice.

00:22:07.020 --> 00:22:10.050
Because that's where-- that
was the place if you wanted

00:22:10.050 --> 00:22:14.820
to learn how to make
linen with Teflon or you

00:22:14.820 --> 00:22:18.390
wanted to make Kevlar
with nylon and with wool.

00:22:18.390 --> 00:22:20.590
That was the place.

00:22:20.590 --> 00:22:22.670
Now, it's not that way anymore.

00:22:22.670 --> 00:22:25.060
So even if you want
to make textiles,

00:22:25.060 --> 00:22:29.500
you don't have to live
in Prato or in Italy.

00:22:29.500 --> 00:22:33.280
Many of our best
technicians now work

00:22:33.280 --> 00:22:37.390
in China or in other places.

00:22:37.390 --> 00:22:39.930
So it's a big world.

00:22:39.930 --> 00:22:40.950
And you are not--

00:22:40.950 --> 00:22:43.100
you don't have to--

00:22:43.100 --> 00:22:44.190
you are not guilty.

00:22:44.190 --> 00:22:47.760
And you should never
feel guilty for this.

00:22:47.760 --> 00:22:51.725
INTERVIEWER: And so why didn't
you make a similar choice?

00:22:51.725 --> 00:22:53.350
EDOARDO NESI: Well,
it's a funny story.

00:22:53.350 --> 00:22:54.474
I was a bit afraid of this.

00:22:54.474 --> 00:22:56.050
Because I started very well.

00:22:56.050 --> 00:22:59.710
Because I had the idea
that I wanted to come here

00:22:59.710 --> 00:23:02.260
to attend in university.

00:23:02.260 --> 00:23:07.120
And I was in a summer
session in '85 and '87.

00:23:07.120 --> 00:23:09.700
I went to Harvard,
and I went to Cornell.

00:23:09.700 --> 00:23:12.980
So I knew the system.

00:23:12.980 --> 00:23:18.370
But then, you know, it was
the golden age for Prato.

00:23:18.370 --> 00:23:22.430
And everything was
very la dolce vita.

00:23:22.430 --> 00:23:24.010
It was la dolce vita.

00:23:24.010 --> 00:23:25.540
And I was very young.

00:23:25.540 --> 00:23:29.140
And I did not have not even a
friend that was coming with me.

00:23:29.140 --> 00:23:32.690
And my family was
perfectly OK with the idea

00:23:32.690 --> 00:23:33.800
that I stayed in Prato.

00:23:33.800 --> 00:23:37.540
And so I had no strength,
no courage enough,

00:23:37.540 --> 00:23:39.210
let's say, to come here.

00:23:39.210 --> 00:23:40.920
INTERVIEWER: Maybe
it's the timing thing.

00:23:40.920 --> 00:23:42.665
Just a few years made
a big difference.

00:23:42.665 --> 00:23:43.498
EDOARDO NESI: Maybe.

00:23:43.498 --> 00:23:46.770
Then I met Carlotta,
my wonderful wife.

00:23:46.770 --> 00:23:51.136
And so the idea of coming
to America was finished.

00:23:51.136 --> 00:23:53.480
[CHUCKLES]

00:23:53.480 --> 00:23:57.970
INTERVIEWER: So in the most
recent part of your life,

00:23:57.970 --> 00:23:59.410
you have been a politician.

00:23:59.410 --> 00:24:03.310
And you have been a
member of the parliament.

00:24:03.310 --> 00:24:06.220
We are coming out of a very--

00:24:06.220 --> 00:24:08.420
well, coming out-- we're
probably not yet out

00:24:08.420 --> 00:24:10.900
of a very interesting
political season in Italy.

00:24:10.900 --> 00:24:14.980
Elections happen, situation
is very confusing.

00:24:14.980 --> 00:24:18.700
We're still not clear on who's
going to govern in Italy.

00:24:18.700 --> 00:24:20.770
But one thing that is
clear is that there's

00:24:20.770 --> 00:24:24.100
this new 5 Stelle
movement that's

00:24:24.100 --> 00:24:25.750
the fastest-growing party.

00:24:25.750 --> 00:24:29.410
And one of the key
points of their program

00:24:29.410 --> 00:24:31.570
is actually the
protection of "Made

00:24:31.570 --> 00:24:35.620
in Italy" and the elimination
of the Europe tax.

00:24:35.620 --> 00:24:38.390
And you touch both of
those things in your book.

00:24:38.390 --> 00:24:40.940
And so I was wondering--

00:24:40.940 --> 00:24:41.960
that must be feel--

00:24:41.960 --> 00:24:43.210
feeling very close to you.

00:24:43.210 --> 00:24:45.910
And are they getting
this right on this front?

00:24:45.910 --> 00:24:48.040
Is that the solution?

00:24:48.040 --> 00:24:51.650
EDOARDO NESI: Let me
start with the beginning.

00:24:51.650 --> 00:24:54.200
After my book,
"Study of My People,"

00:24:54.200 --> 00:24:58.190
won the Strega Prize,
many politician

00:24:58.190 --> 00:25:01.160
seemed to start to think
that I was right on the fact

00:25:01.160 --> 00:25:06.620
that you have to understand
how impossible it had become

00:25:06.620 --> 00:25:09.710
for a textile company, or
even for every manufacturing

00:25:09.710 --> 00:25:12.300
company in Italy, to survive.

00:25:12.300 --> 00:25:14.960
And so they said, why don't
you enter in politics?

00:25:14.960 --> 00:25:17.290
Why don't you candidate?

00:25:17.290 --> 00:25:20.790
Why don't you
enter in the system

00:25:20.790 --> 00:25:25.870
and try to give a
contribution and try to help?

00:25:25.870 --> 00:25:30.880
That was very naive on my side.

00:25:30.880 --> 00:25:34.720
Because I thought
it could be true.

00:25:34.720 --> 00:25:36.370
So I entered in the parliament.

00:25:36.370 --> 00:25:38.690
I was a candidate,
and I was elected,

00:25:38.690 --> 00:25:39.940
and I went to parliament.

00:25:39.940 --> 00:25:41.710
And I thought that
I could really

00:25:41.710 --> 00:25:47.806
make a difference, which is,
in retrospect, even very funny.

00:25:47.806 --> 00:25:49.630
[CHUCKLES]

00:25:49.630 --> 00:25:50.930
Let me just tell you one thing.

00:25:50.930 --> 00:25:58.320
The Chamber of Deputies
in Italy has 630 persons.

00:25:58.320 --> 00:26:03.150
The Italian Senate has 315.

00:26:03.150 --> 00:26:05.910
So when we elect the
President of the Republic,

00:26:05.910 --> 00:26:09.240
we are 1,000 people.

00:26:09.240 --> 00:26:14.960
So I know that in Congress,
you have so much less

00:26:14.960 --> 00:26:15.980
of these numbers.

00:26:15.980 --> 00:26:18.440
You know, you have many--

00:26:18.440 --> 00:26:23.510
not-- I'm sure it's hard
for you to understand,

00:26:23.510 --> 00:26:25.880
how is it possible
that 1,000 people are

00:26:25.880 --> 00:26:27.380
needed to govern the country?

00:26:27.380 --> 00:26:29.420
And then you see how
bad they govern it.

00:26:29.420 --> 00:26:31.150
[LAUGHTER]

00:26:31.150 --> 00:26:32.600
Maybe because there are so many.

00:26:32.600 --> 00:26:34.340
I don't know.

00:26:34.340 --> 00:26:36.440
But this 5 Stelle
phenomenon is something

00:26:36.440 --> 00:26:39.530
I have to spend a few
minutes to tell you about,

00:26:39.530 --> 00:26:40.770
because it's very funny.

00:26:40.770 --> 00:26:44.090
So the creator of
this phenomenon

00:26:44.090 --> 00:26:47.450
is a stand-up comedian.

00:26:47.450 --> 00:26:49.250
No, you're laughing,
but it's true.

00:26:49.250 --> 00:26:50.510
[LAUGHTER]

00:26:50.510 --> 00:26:54.200
He was one of the most important
stand-up comedian in Italy--

00:26:54.200 --> 00:26:56.330
was very good, very funny.

00:26:56.330 --> 00:26:59.690
Then he started to say that
everything had to change.

00:26:59.690 --> 00:27:04.530
And he started to
found this movement.

00:27:04.530 --> 00:27:09.500
And they won the election.

00:27:09.500 --> 00:27:12.940
After 10 years, they
won the elections.

00:27:12.940 --> 00:27:15.070
And believe it or
not, the people

00:27:15.070 --> 00:27:18.300
that are elected by this--

00:27:18.300 --> 00:27:20.320
by this movement, they are not--

00:27:20.320 --> 00:27:23.400
they are chosen online.

00:27:23.400 --> 00:27:27.180
So they-- I see your expression.

00:27:27.180 --> 00:27:28.470
But it's true.

00:27:28.470 --> 00:27:31.680
OK, so you say you
want to be elected.

00:27:31.680 --> 00:27:34.230
And you go in a particular site.

00:27:34.230 --> 00:27:37.740
And you say that--

00:27:37.740 --> 00:27:38.860
you present yourself.

00:27:38.860 --> 00:27:39.610
You make a video.

00:27:39.610 --> 00:27:43.950
And the people go there,
and they choose you.

00:27:43.950 --> 00:27:50.980
And some of these people were
elected with 50 votes, 5-0.

00:27:50.980 --> 00:27:52.760
So they are friends.

00:27:52.760 --> 00:27:54.070
They voted for him.

00:27:54.070 --> 00:27:58.990
And they were in a part of
the list that was elected,

00:27:58.990 --> 00:28:00.700
because so many
Italians voted for them.

00:28:04.220 --> 00:28:06.110
And they won the elections.

00:28:06.110 --> 00:28:09.590
They went very well in the last
elections, and they won these.

00:28:09.590 --> 00:28:12.800
And the people there,
they are usually

00:28:12.800 --> 00:28:17.570
directed by a company in Milan
and by the stand-up comedian

00:28:17.570 --> 00:28:19.170
that is still there.

00:28:19.170 --> 00:28:23.420
And the last thing he said,
work is not important, he said.

00:28:23.420 --> 00:28:24.710
[CHUCKLES]

00:28:24.710 --> 00:28:26.120
You laugh.

00:28:26.120 --> 00:28:26.630
And I laugh.

00:28:26.630 --> 00:28:27.960
But it's what he said.

00:28:27.960 --> 00:28:29.450
And the people voted for him.

00:28:29.450 --> 00:28:34.190
They said the state should
pay the people to live.

00:28:34.190 --> 00:28:37.640
He said it should
be 600 euro a month,

00:28:37.640 --> 00:28:40.556
which, in dollar, is
$800, something like this.

00:28:40.556 --> 00:28:41.930
INTERVIEWER: Yeah,
roughly, yeah.

00:28:41.930 --> 00:28:45.620
EDOARDO NESI: And they won the
elections with this promise.

00:28:45.620 --> 00:28:49.310
And now we are in the process
of making a government with a--

00:28:49.310 --> 00:28:54.110
with the liga, the league,
which is a racist party,

00:28:54.110 --> 00:28:58.930
which is a fascist party.

00:28:58.930 --> 00:29:05.100
So then, well, this is
how Italy has become.

00:29:05.100 --> 00:29:08.080
This is why this book
had success in Italy,

00:29:08.080 --> 00:29:09.630
and I hope it will
have success here.

00:29:09.630 --> 00:29:13.290
Because it's an
incredible story of how

00:29:13.290 --> 00:29:16.230
one of the most fantastic
country in the world

00:29:16.230 --> 00:29:17.840
really went down the sink.

00:29:17.840 --> 00:29:21.170
But anyway, last thing to say--

00:29:21.170 --> 00:29:23.711
"Made in Italy," the
movimiento, the 5 Stelle

00:29:23.711 --> 00:29:25.710
say that we want to protect
the "Made in Italy."

00:29:31.270 --> 00:29:33.640
Well, there is the percentage.

00:29:33.640 --> 00:29:38.950
10% only of their elected
people have been working

00:29:38.950 --> 00:29:41.020
a single day in their life.

00:29:41.020 --> 00:29:42.804
The rest, 85% of the people--

00:29:42.804 --> 00:29:44.470
because when you go
into the parliament,

00:29:44.470 --> 00:29:48.440
you have to present
your declaration.

00:29:48.440 --> 00:29:51.410
You have to say how much
have been making money.

00:29:51.410 --> 00:29:54.890
85% of them have never worked.

00:29:54.890 --> 00:29:59.210
They were students, or
they were in between jobs.

00:29:59.210 --> 00:30:02.720
Or they were living
with their family.

00:30:02.720 --> 00:30:04.582
And so when they
say in parliament

00:30:04.582 --> 00:30:07.040
that they want to protect the
"Made in Italy," I always ask

00:30:07.040 --> 00:30:09.030
them, what do you know
about "Made in Italy"?

00:30:09.030 --> 00:30:11.560
What have you been doing for
"Made in Italy" personally?

00:30:11.560 --> 00:30:12.770
What you know about this?

00:30:15.490 --> 00:30:17.950
Well, maybe I should stop here.

00:30:17.950 --> 00:30:19.390
[LAUGHTER]

00:30:19.390 --> 00:30:24.070
Because I realize how emotional
I can become on the subject.

00:30:24.070 --> 00:30:26.590
Because the problem is
that they should not win.

00:30:26.590 --> 00:30:31.950
Somebody else should have been
an alternative for the people.

00:30:31.950 --> 00:30:34.960
It should have been going to the
election and say, vote for me.

00:30:34.960 --> 00:30:37.060
Don't vote for these people.

00:30:37.060 --> 00:30:40.690
But it's another funny thing--

00:30:40.690 --> 00:30:44.590
their promise of the
600 euros a month

00:30:44.590 --> 00:30:49.460
has been understood
by the people.

00:30:49.460 --> 00:30:52.000
So they read on--

00:30:52.000 --> 00:30:53.500
and they watched
on television, they

00:30:53.500 --> 00:30:55.570
saw-- they read in the
newspapers and online

00:30:55.570 --> 00:30:57.770
that 5 Stelle won the elections.

00:30:57.770 --> 00:31:02.980
So they went to the common and
say, give me the 600 euros.

00:31:02.980 --> 00:31:05.300
So I said, what?

00:31:05.300 --> 00:31:06.770
They said, they won.

00:31:06.770 --> 00:31:07.730
We voted for them.

00:31:07.730 --> 00:31:10.310
Give us the money.

00:31:10.310 --> 00:31:14.030
Which is true, which is fine,
which is a good direction.

00:31:14.030 --> 00:31:16.690
Problem is that they will not--

00:31:16.690 --> 00:31:22.212
they will never be able
to make up this promise.

00:31:22.212 --> 00:31:25.130
INTERVIEWER: All
right, so it's--

00:31:25.130 --> 00:31:28.640
we're not doing much
better than before.

00:31:28.640 --> 00:31:31.090
EDOARDO NESI: Well,
week after that, but--

00:31:31.090 --> 00:31:33.710
week after that, I think.

00:31:33.710 --> 00:31:39.050
INTERVIEWER: So let's go
to American politics now.

00:31:39.050 --> 00:31:41.610
At the last minute,
you called Guido

00:31:41.610 --> 00:31:45.740
pleading to cancel the book,
because you perceived that you

00:31:45.740 --> 00:31:49.940
were inadvertently supporting
Trump based on his campaign

00:31:49.940 --> 00:31:52.560
and inauguration speech.

00:31:52.560 --> 00:31:56.940
So based on the past year
that Trump has been in office,

00:31:56.940 --> 00:31:59.090
do you think he's
actually been able to make

00:31:59.090 --> 00:32:01.610
any difference with
respect to the situation

00:32:01.610 --> 00:32:03.730
of the middle class in America?

00:32:03.730 --> 00:32:05.480
EDOARDO NESI: Well,
this is a funny story.

00:32:08.930 --> 00:32:12.770
I follow the elections,
the American elections,

00:32:12.770 --> 00:32:16.160
and I had to stay up
very late at night

00:32:16.160 --> 00:32:20.180
because of the difference
of the time zone.

00:32:20.180 --> 00:32:24.360
And what I couldn't understand--

00:32:24.360 --> 00:32:26.310
I couldn't understand
this situation.

00:32:26.310 --> 00:32:34.010
Because I still remember how the
polls went so terribly wrong.

00:32:34.010 --> 00:32:38.410
And then, when I saw that
Florida was lost, I said,

00:32:38.410 --> 00:32:39.250
I'm going to bed.

00:32:39.250 --> 00:32:41.010
I don't want to know anything.

00:32:41.010 --> 00:32:45.890
So I went to bed, and I
saw the disaster that came.

00:32:45.890 --> 00:32:48.000
But the inaugural speech
was important for me,

00:32:48.000 --> 00:32:52.650
because we wanted to finish the
book with the inaugural speech

00:32:52.650 --> 00:32:54.504
of the new president.

00:32:54.504 --> 00:32:56.170
And we thought about
Hillary, of course,

00:32:56.170 --> 00:32:58.660
because we wanted to have
his husband at the beginning

00:32:58.660 --> 00:33:02.160
and her at the end, so-- and
see how everything has changed

00:33:02.160 --> 00:33:04.980
after so many years, how
globalization has changed,

00:33:04.980 --> 00:33:07.530
if anybody had to say something
about the disaster that

00:33:07.530 --> 00:33:11.490
came for many people
in the Western world.

00:33:11.490 --> 00:33:14.930
And then we found with Trump--

00:33:14.930 --> 00:33:15.790
and I don't know.

00:33:15.790 --> 00:33:17.500
Maybe for you--

00:33:17.500 --> 00:33:21.010
I'm sure for you if it was even
more incredible than for me.

00:33:21.010 --> 00:33:26.950
But seeing President
Obama with this person,

00:33:26.950 --> 00:33:32.650
taking him, and helping
him to the podium,

00:33:32.650 --> 00:33:34.140
and it was terrible.

00:33:34.140 --> 00:33:38.140
And the inaugural speech
was full of the things

00:33:38.140 --> 00:33:41.510
that we wrote in the book.

00:33:41.510 --> 00:33:45.470
Because one of the problems
that we had with Trump

00:33:45.470 --> 00:33:48.920
was that a lot of
things that he said--

00:33:51.450 --> 00:33:55.110
and then he will never be
able to maintain, of course--

00:33:55.110 --> 00:34:00.210
there were something
that could have been used

00:34:00.210 --> 00:34:03.480
in Italy to stop the disaster.

00:34:03.480 --> 00:34:06.510
I'm not talking about America
First, because Italy First is

00:34:06.510 --> 00:34:07.980
even funny to say.

00:34:07.980 --> 00:34:11.790
Because we don't--
we are exporters.

00:34:11.790 --> 00:34:13.110
We are net exporters.

00:34:13.110 --> 00:34:14.550
We live on export.

00:34:14.550 --> 00:34:18.989
And so whenever we say that we
want to close a market, for us,

00:34:18.989 --> 00:34:21.090
it would be a disaster.

00:34:21.090 --> 00:34:23.610
So you have the inauguration
speech, and we said--

00:34:23.610 --> 00:34:24.800
we heard what he said.

00:34:24.800 --> 00:34:26.934
We said, let's cancel the book.

00:34:26.934 --> 00:34:29.100
We don't want to be-- we
don't want anybody to think

00:34:29.100 --> 00:34:32.449
that we agree with this person.

00:34:32.449 --> 00:34:35.250
And we were about to sell it.

00:34:35.250 --> 00:34:37.920
But then, we were
able to understand

00:34:37.920 --> 00:34:43.930
how the problem with
globalization is not--

00:34:43.930 --> 00:34:46.070
it's not even the
election of Trump.

00:34:46.070 --> 00:34:51.420
It's something so much
bigger that maybe--

00:34:51.420 --> 00:34:54.710
that should have been
a different approach

00:34:54.710 --> 00:34:55.760
since the beginning.

00:34:55.760 --> 00:35:00.110
Because I'm sure that we
all believe in open markets.

00:35:00.110 --> 00:35:02.360
We all believe in free trade.

00:35:02.360 --> 00:35:04.160
But then, we also
have to understand

00:35:04.160 --> 00:35:09.080
that, for example, there is
a lot of the quality of life

00:35:09.080 --> 00:35:13.680
that you risk to lose whenever
you buy the cheapest good.

00:35:13.680 --> 00:35:15.850
This idea of the
cheapest good to buy

00:35:15.850 --> 00:35:18.780
is something we should
really should think about.

00:35:18.780 --> 00:35:21.870
Because there is an
underside to that.

00:35:21.870 --> 00:35:24.210
When you spend less
money for something,

00:35:24.210 --> 00:35:28.110
you spend less money in
a quality of the thing.

00:35:28.110 --> 00:35:33.300
And the quality of the things
you buy, you wear, you use

00:35:33.300 --> 00:35:38.710
is very important not only
for the general market

00:35:38.710 --> 00:35:40.720
but even for yourself.

00:35:40.720 --> 00:35:45.030
Because if you dress
bad, you will live bad.

00:35:45.030 --> 00:35:49.110
If you buy something that
is not any good quality,

00:35:49.110 --> 00:35:53.340
then even your life will
be affected by that.

00:35:53.340 --> 00:35:56.360
And we should have
been discussing this

00:35:56.360 --> 00:36:00.360
before starting the process.

00:36:00.360 --> 00:36:02.750
INTERVIEWER: So that brings to--

00:36:02.750 --> 00:36:04.730
a little bit back to Europe.

00:36:04.730 --> 00:36:08.600
The euro-- so there
is a great description

00:36:08.600 --> 00:36:11.420
in the book of like, well,
what the euro and what

00:36:11.420 --> 00:36:15.020
getting into Europe meant for
all the different countries.

00:36:15.020 --> 00:36:18.380
And I really enjoyed the
contrast between the Southern

00:36:18.380 --> 00:36:21.770
and the Northern Europe.

00:36:21.770 --> 00:36:25.790
What should we have done
there-- not get in, negotiate

00:36:25.790 --> 00:36:27.050
better condition?

00:36:27.050 --> 00:36:28.620
Shall we get out now?

00:36:28.620 --> 00:36:30.440
EDOARDO NESI: No, no,
no, no, no, no, no.

00:36:30.440 --> 00:36:33.360
That would be the final--
the final straw for us.

00:36:33.360 --> 00:36:35.780
No.

00:36:35.780 --> 00:36:37.290
I've never been
against the euro.

00:36:37.290 --> 00:36:41.400
I think it's
extremely important.

00:36:41.400 --> 00:36:45.480
Maybe we should--
well, think about this.

00:36:45.480 --> 00:36:49.980
I mean, you take European
countries, which are completely

00:36:49.980 --> 00:36:52.490
different one from the other,
and you put all of them

00:36:52.490 --> 00:36:52.990
together.

00:36:52.990 --> 00:36:55.860
And you give them
a single currency.

00:36:55.860 --> 00:37:04.240
And then you start to realize
that, for example, Greece

00:37:04.240 --> 00:37:07.780
didn't say the truth
on the declaration

00:37:07.780 --> 00:37:09.760
when it got into Europe.

00:37:09.760 --> 00:37:14.140
I mean, their balance
sheet was not correct.

00:37:14.140 --> 00:37:16.660
They had been falsified.

00:37:16.660 --> 00:37:21.770
So the speculation,
let's call it like this--

00:37:21.770 --> 00:37:25.680
Guido wouldn't like it, but
let's call it the speculation.

00:37:25.680 --> 00:37:32.050
They started to assault Greece
and after Greece, Italy.

00:37:32.050 --> 00:37:34.240
And so we said, we are Europe.

00:37:34.240 --> 00:37:38.930
I mean, the Central Bank
of Europe will save us.

00:37:38.930 --> 00:37:41.030
It didn't happen like this.

00:37:41.030 --> 00:37:42.860
The Germans said,
we are not going

00:37:42.860 --> 00:37:46.730
to spend money to save Greece.

00:37:46.730 --> 00:37:53.690
That's a country that has
been corrupt for centuries.

00:37:53.690 --> 00:37:56.270
And the same thing
they said about us.

00:37:56.270 --> 00:37:59.180
The interests of these two
countries are too different.

00:37:59.180 --> 00:38:03.550
So it's a very difficult--

00:38:03.550 --> 00:38:04.580
how would you say--

00:38:04.580 --> 00:38:07.220
it's a very difficult
system to stand inside.

00:38:07.220 --> 00:38:09.050
And so the interests
are different.

00:38:09.050 --> 00:38:11.735
The politics are different.

00:38:11.735 --> 00:38:14.510
The countries are different.

00:38:14.510 --> 00:38:20.430
Germany is so strong and so good
and so perfectly administered.

00:38:20.430 --> 00:38:24.120
And Italy doesn't have the
chance to stand up to this.

00:38:24.120 --> 00:38:27.570
So until they will
keep us in the euro,

00:38:27.570 --> 00:38:30.150
I would like to stay there.

00:38:30.150 --> 00:38:33.836
And I think it's Italy's
interest to be there.

00:38:33.836 --> 00:38:34.780
INTERVIEWER: Cool.

00:38:34.780 --> 00:38:37.210
I'd like to know if
there's an opening

00:38:37.210 --> 00:38:39.535
to question in the
audience, if there is any?

00:38:39.535 --> 00:38:40.910
AUDIENCE: Well,
one of the things

00:38:40.910 --> 00:38:44.660
I noticed you had commented
on was the large number

00:38:44.660 --> 00:38:47.390
of people in parliament
who said had never worked.

00:38:47.390 --> 00:38:51.020
And this has also been
an issue in the US.

00:38:51.020 --> 00:38:55.670
And one of the kind of
structural reactions to that

00:38:55.670 --> 00:38:58.930
was the introduction of
term limits for politicians.

00:38:58.930 --> 00:39:01.430
And I don't know if you have
any thoughts on whether you

00:39:01.430 --> 00:39:04.610
think that would be a good
thing, a bad thing, if it would

00:39:04.610 --> 00:39:06.020
help?

00:39:06.020 --> 00:39:08.830
EDOARDO NESI: Well, of
course it would be--

00:39:08.830 --> 00:39:11.249
there is-- in
Italy, for example,

00:39:11.249 --> 00:39:13.790
in the new parliament, there is
people that have been elected

00:39:13.790 --> 00:39:15.830
seven times, eight times.

00:39:15.830 --> 00:39:20.860
And they really did nothing to
justify these seven or eight

00:39:20.860 --> 00:39:22.320
elections.

00:39:22.320 --> 00:39:26.700
But it's a system of power
that perpetuates itself.

00:39:26.700 --> 00:39:28.200
And it's something that--

00:39:28.200 --> 00:39:30.290
it could be done.

00:39:30.290 --> 00:39:33.590
Well, it depends
on how many terms.

00:39:33.590 --> 00:39:36.450
Because if you say two terms,
I think it's not enough.

00:39:36.450 --> 00:39:38.270
It might be three terms.

00:39:38.270 --> 00:39:40.730
But then, when you think
about a political term

00:39:40.730 --> 00:39:43.730
here in the United States,
you think about four years.

00:39:43.730 --> 00:39:47.300
In Italy, government
can last months.

00:39:47.300 --> 00:39:49.280
So whenever there is a
term of a few months,

00:39:49.280 --> 00:39:55.550
maybe it's not enough to
state your competence.

00:39:55.550 --> 00:39:59.390
So well, yes, I think
there should be a limit.

00:39:59.390 --> 00:40:04.670
And even, I mean, you have
here a two terms limit

00:40:04.670 --> 00:40:06.455
for a president, for example.

00:40:06.455 --> 00:40:10.200
In Italy, you had people that
had been president of the--

00:40:10.200 --> 00:40:14.060
well, [INAUDIBLE],, let's
say for three, four times.

00:40:14.060 --> 00:40:16.460
And I think it--

00:40:16.460 --> 00:40:17.180
yes.

00:40:17.180 --> 00:40:19.670
Yes, I think I would support it.

00:40:19.670 --> 00:40:24.300
AUDIENCE: What do you think is
the hope for the middle class?

00:40:24.300 --> 00:40:27.380
What things can the private
sector and government

00:40:27.380 --> 00:40:32.730
do to preserve the essential
role of middle class

00:40:32.730 --> 00:40:35.150
in democracy?

00:40:35.150 --> 00:40:38.690
EDOARDO NESI: Well, this is the
question, the most important

00:40:38.690 --> 00:40:39.470
one.

00:40:39.470 --> 00:40:43.310
Let me just tell
you a brief story.

00:40:43.310 --> 00:40:47.810
I mean, one of the reasons why I
said that Italy was a fantastic

00:40:47.810 --> 00:40:54.600
country was that for,
let's say, 50 years,

00:40:54.600 --> 00:40:57.600
the idea that you call the
American Dream was also

00:40:57.600 --> 00:40:59.070
the Italian Dream.

00:40:59.070 --> 00:41:00.990
But it was even more.

00:41:00.990 --> 00:41:02.950
Because think about this.

00:41:02.950 --> 00:41:06.620
We have a South of Italy, which
is in a very bad situation

00:41:06.620 --> 00:41:09.486
since ever.

00:41:09.486 --> 00:41:15.640
And we had a huge immigration
from Campania from the South,

00:41:15.640 --> 00:41:16.140
to--

00:41:16.140 --> 00:41:18.510
even to Prato, to my hometown.

00:41:18.510 --> 00:41:19.590
And they came there.

00:41:19.590 --> 00:41:21.900
And they started to work
as ordinary workers.

00:41:21.900 --> 00:41:25.880
And then they started to
buy one loom, two looms.

00:41:25.880 --> 00:41:29.060
And they started to
become entrepreneurs.

00:41:29.060 --> 00:41:33.470
And this system, this idea
that your destiny was not

00:41:33.470 --> 00:41:38.840
already written was as an
extremely strong motivation

00:41:38.840 --> 00:41:40.130
for the people.

00:41:40.130 --> 00:41:42.650
And in Italy, we
used to say-- well,

00:41:42.650 --> 00:41:45.310
Prato was one of
the centers of this.

00:41:45.310 --> 00:41:49.220
I mean, if you study,
if you work hard,

00:41:49.220 --> 00:41:51.170
then you will make money.

00:41:51.170 --> 00:41:54.650
And this is a fundamental
promise for middle class.

00:41:54.650 --> 00:42:00.210
Because you be-- well, you
enter the middle class.

00:42:00.210 --> 00:42:05.894
If you think about it, Italy
had not a big middle class

00:42:05.894 --> 00:42:07.220
after the war.

00:42:07.220 --> 00:42:10.460
You had very rich people,
and you had very poor people.

00:42:10.460 --> 00:42:13.490
And then you started to create
a middle class with this,

00:42:13.490 --> 00:42:15.180
with work, with
people that started

00:42:15.180 --> 00:42:18.180
to work in the private
sector and started

00:42:18.180 --> 00:42:21.800
to work in banks and in
services and in industry.

00:42:21.800 --> 00:42:24.350
And there was a
creation of well-being

00:42:24.350 --> 00:42:29.380
that was American, in a way.

00:42:29.380 --> 00:42:35.390
And it was funny, because
then always in those times,

00:42:35.390 --> 00:42:38.540
the Communist Party was
extremely strong in Italy.

00:42:38.540 --> 00:42:40.310
So we had a strong
Communist Party

00:42:40.310 --> 00:42:43.430
and a huge economical growth.

00:42:43.430 --> 00:42:47.300
I wonder if these things
can, in a way, go together.

00:42:47.300 --> 00:42:49.480
But that was very,
very interesting.

00:42:49.480 --> 00:42:51.980
And then we had a
fantastic growth,

00:42:51.980 --> 00:42:56.060
and the middle class
had started to emerge.

00:42:56.060 --> 00:42:58.340
But the problem is that
this middle class never

00:42:58.340 --> 00:43:01.350
asked for a better politics.

00:43:01.350 --> 00:43:03.510
They kept on voting for
the same party, which

00:43:03.510 --> 00:43:10.710
was called Christian Democracy,
for many, many, many years.

00:43:10.710 --> 00:43:13.380
And they never asked
for something better.

00:43:13.380 --> 00:43:18.140
They were too busy
trying to make money.

00:43:18.140 --> 00:43:19.590
This is one of the problems.

00:43:19.590 --> 00:43:24.310
But what can be done
now, it's very difficult.

00:43:24.310 --> 00:43:28.900
Because you could not grow up--

00:43:28.900 --> 00:43:35.110
well, the startup-- the startup
phenomenon in Italy is coming.

00:43:35.110 --> 00:43:36.350
I mean, it's important.

00:43:36.350 --> 00:43:40.870
But not even one of these
startup is labor intensive.

00:43:40.870 --> 00:43:45.550
All of them, they need one,
two persons, and that's all.

00:43:45.550 --> 00:43:49.930
My company had 40
people working all day.

00:43:49.930 --> 00:43:53.290
And then, Prato had the
system that production

00:43:53.290 --> 00:43:56.350
could be made by many
other people that

00:43:56.350 --> 00:43:59.400
were working for you.

00:43:59.400 --> 00:44:01.110
And this is a
contradiction of what

00:44:01.110 --> 00:44:03.270
the general economic
theory says.

00:44:03.270 --> 00:44:07.650
It's saying you have to unite
everything, all your production

00:44:07.650 --> 00:44:10.950
under your single--

00:44:10.950 --> 00:44:15.750
after-- in your company, so
you keep things under control.

00:44:15.750 --> 00:44:19.200
And what happened in Prato
was that everything was given

00:44:19.200 --> 00:44:21.764
freely to the other people.

00:44:21.764 --> 00:44:23.680
You could have just an
office and a telephone.

00:44:23.680 --> 00:44:30.810
Then, somebody was going
to spin the wool and make--

00:44:30.810 --> 00:44:33.810
and then you can have
somebody weave it for you,

00:44:33.810 --> 00:44:38.350
somebody dying it for you,
somebody finishing it for you.

00:44:38.350 --> 00:44:41.640
And then you had your product,
and you were selling it.

00:44:41.640 --> 00:44:45.180
And the quality was
fantastic in every step,

00:44:45.180 --> 00:44:48.290
because the private people that
we're working for everybody,

00:44:48.290 --> 00:44:50.310
they were-- they
had to be very good.

00:44:50.310 --> 00:44:52.450
Otherwise, they wouldn't work.

00:44:52.450 --> 00:44:54.660
So the system was
working perfectly.

00:44:54.660 --> 00:44:57.437
And that was creating
middle class.

00:44:57.437 --> 00:44:59.770
Because you have people from
the South that had nothing.

00:44:59.770 --> 00:45:02.510
And then, in 10
years, they had--

00:45:02.510 --> 00:45:05.790
they had a house, because there
was a banking system there.

00:45:05.790 --> 00:45:09.280
And money was given freely--
maybe too freely but not so

00:45:09.280 --> 00:45:12.200
much, not so much.

00:45:12.200 --> 00:45:17.300
Until the 1990, money was
given with a certain ease,

00:45:17.300 --> 00:45:19.920
but it helped a lot.

00:45:19.920 --> 00:45:21.980
So what can be done now?

00:45:21.980 --> 00:45:23.180
Frankly, I don't know.

00:45:23.180 --> 00:45:27.840
I don't have a lot
of hope on this.

00:45:27.840 --> 00:45:31.140
But coming here to
California, for example,

00:45:31.140 --> 00:45:33.240
I've been here two days,
so I saw almost nothing.

00:45:33.240 --> 00:45:41.770
But I started to recognize some
signs of an economic growth.

00:45:41.770 --> 00:45:44.430
And that was
accelerating for me.

00:45:44.430 --> 00:45:46.500
It was really--

00:45:46.500 --> 00:45:53.960
I was-- seeing people that work
hard to make money and really

00:45:53.960 --> 00:45:57.620
make money, it's
exhilarating for me.

00:45:57.620 --> 00:45:59.210
It's a throwback to my past.

00:45:59.210 --> 00:46:02.790
So it was nice to be here.

00:46:02.790 --> 00:46:04.740
AUDIENCE: So here
at Google, and I

00:46:04.740 --> 00:46:06.390
think in the tech
industry in general,

00:46:06.390 --> 00:46:10.800
we talk a lot about access
and building for everybody.

00:46:10.800 --> 00:46:12.180
But on the converse,
in your book

00:46:12.180 --> 00:46:15.930
and in the media in general, you
hear a lot about this problem,

00:46:15.930 --> 00:46:20.820
in particular the economic
divide increasing over a span

00:46:20.820 --> 00:46:26.640
that we'd also associate with
a technological improvement

00:46:26.640 --> 00:46:28.620
or an increase in access.

00:46:28.620 --> 00:46:32.070
Do you think the
tech industry is

00:46:32.070 --> 00:46:34.950
helping mitigate the problem?

00:46:34.950 --> 00:46:37.290
Is it improving this
issue, slowing it down?

00:46:37.290 --> 00:46:39.204
Or is it accelerating it?

00:46:39.204 --> 00:46:40.995
EDOARDO NESI: This is
a very good question.

00:46:43.830 --> 00:46:46.120
It might help.

00:46:46.120 --> 00:46:48.078
It might help more, also.

00:46:53.550 --> 00:46:57.270
Because this is one of the--
the relationship with technology

00:46:57.270 --> 00:47:00.840
was one of the problem for Italy
and for textile, for example.

00:47:00.840 --> 00:47:04.050
Textile is one of
the industry where

00:47:04.050 --> 00:47:07.860
working with a loom that
is 30 years old or three

00:47:07.860 --> 00:47:13.820
years old, if you have to weave
wool, is more or less the same.

00:47:13.820 --> 00:47:15.330
And this terrible.

00:47:15.330 --> 00:47:19.330
Because if you cannot count
on the help of technology,

00:47:19.330 --> 00:47:20.280
[INAUDIBLE].

00:47:20.280 --> 00:47:22.980
Well, then somebody can take
your business very easily.

00:47:27.706 --> 00:47:30.880
For some fibers,
for example, it's

00:47:30.880 --> 00:47:34.135
even better if you work
it with very old looms.

00:47:37.090 --> 00:47:41.500
There are not many
successful companies--

00:47:41.500 --> 00:47:43.130
textile companies now in Prato.

00:47:43.130 --> 00:47:46.360
But one which is very
successful, and they make--

00:47:46.360 --> 00:47:47.669
[SPEAKING ITALIAN]

00:47:47.669 --> 00:47:48.460
INTERVIEWER: Scarf.

00:47:48.460 --> 00:47:49.730
EDOARDO NESI: Scarves.

00:47:49.730 --> 00:47:51.460
Scarves.

00:47:51.460 --> 00:47:54.800
They are actually
friends of mine.

00:47:54.800 --> 00:47:58.750
They make scarves with the most
beautiful and fine cashmere

00:47:58.750 --> 00:47:59.880
in the world.

00:47:59.880 --> 00:48:07.030
But they weave the scarves
with hand looms, by hand.

00:48:07.030 --> 00:48:09.580
And they have people--

00:48:09.580 --> 00:48:11.620
sometimes they are
old ladies that

00:48:11.620 --> 00:48:13.770
know everything about this.

00:48:13.770 --> 00:48:17.140
And they work with a hand loom.

00:48:17.140 --> 00:48:24.150
And if it takes one month to
make a scarf, then it's OK.

00:48:24.150 --> 00:48:31.240
And they sell it for 500 euros
a part-- a scarf, a part,

00:48:31.240 --> 00:48:32.800
and it's OK.

00:48:32.800 --> 00:48:37.060
So this is one of the direction
we could go, and we are going.

00:48:40.772 --> 00:48:45.030
But it doesn't help
to hire people.

00:48:45.030 --> 00:48:47.910
And that, I think,
is a huge problem.

00:48:47.910 --> 00:48:51.380
When technology can not
help you, you don't have--

00:48:51.380 --> 00:48:54.530
you don't have a
great hope for future.

00:48:54.530 --> 00:48:57.740
AUDIENCE: I'm curious about
the "Dances" in the title.

00:48:57.740 --> 00:48:59.690
Where does that come from?

00:48:59.690 --> 00:49:04.580
EDOARDO NESI: Oh, it comes from
The Doors, from-- the title,

00:49:04.580 --> 00:49:05.080
you mean.

00:49:05.080 --> 00:49:05.790
INTERVIEWER: The title, yeah.

00:49:05.790 --> 00:49:07.373
EDOARDO NESI:
"Everything is broken up

00:49:07.373 --> 00:49:11.010
and dances" is a verse by
Jim Morrison of The Doors.

00:49:11.010 --> 00:49:15.465
And being here in Venice
today, I thought that how funny

00:49:15.465 --> 00:49:18.030
to think that everything
starts and finishes here.

00:49:18.030 --> 00:49:20.070
Because he was working here.

00:49:20.070 --> 00:49:21.720
And he was playing here.

00:49:21.720 --> 00:49:26.630
And so probably he made
the poem here in Venice.

00:49:26.630 --> 00:49:29.850
And we are here
talking about him.

00:49:29.850 --> 00:49:34.090
Well, the idea is that I
always loved The Doors.

00:49:34.090 --> 00:49:37.410
But then also the poetry of
Jim Morrison, I read all of it.

00:49:37.410 --> 00:49:40.440
And these particular
verses, I think,

00:49:40.440 --> 00:49:45.090
is perfect to
summarize how things

00:49:45.090 --> 00:49:49.200
are becoming increasingly
difficult for my country.

00:49:49.200 --> 00:49:52.920
We really feel that everything
is breaking up and dances,

00:49:52.920 --> 00:49:55.680
because it's always in
a constant movement.

00:49:55.680 --> 00:49:57.756
And we cannot keep it still.

00:49:57.756 --> 00:49:59.130
INTERVIEWER: Thank
you very much.

00:49:59.130 --> 00:50:01.610
We want to thank Edoardo Nesi
for being here with us today.

00:50:01.610 --> 00:50:02.210
EDOARDO NESI: Thank you.

00:50:02.210 --> 00:50:02.960
Thank you so much.

00:50:02.960 --> 00:50:05.860
[APPLAUSE]
