00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
This answer would simply lead to a decay of the number of infectious persons

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:10.000
no matter what the rate of change is a negative factor times the current value.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
This doesn't make sense

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:17.000
With this answer, the rate of change which depend only on the number of susceptible persons.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:21.000
It would not matter to the rate of change of the number of infectious persons

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:27.000
whether we started with 1 or 10 or 1 million infectious persons.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:33.000
This doesn't make sense. So we have to have a solution that incorporates both quantities.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:39.000
The number of susceptible persons and the number of infectious persons. So what about that ratio?

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:44.000
This would mean that if the number of infectious person is low, this ratio is high.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:49.000
We divide by a small number and the rate would be high which again doesn't make sense.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.000
And there is another reason why this doesn't makes sense,

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:57.000
the unit would be 1/days times persons/persons.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:05.000
This canceled and unit of the result is 1/days but what we need is persons per day,

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.000
so this cannot be true for several reasons.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:12.000
This is what is left and it makes sense. Let's look at the units.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:17.000
A number divided by days and persons, times persons squared.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:24.000
What we are left with is person per day, that's what we need and this product has the right behavior.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.000
If we increase the number of infectious persons, we increase that rate.

00:01:28.000 --> 09:59:59.000
We have more encounters. That makes sense.
