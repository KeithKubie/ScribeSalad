narrative it's and it's not good for the

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:34.650
narrative it's and it's not good for the
 

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:35.990
narrative it's and it's not good for the

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:36.000
kids not by any stretch of the
 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.490
kids not by any stretch of the
imagination and so it's a form of

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:39.500
imagination and so it's a form of
 

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:42.710
imagination and so it's a form of
voluntary enslavement I suppose but it's

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:42.720
voluntary enslavement I suppose but it's
 

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:44.450
voluntary enslavement I suppose but it's
also equivalent to the adoption of a

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:44.460
also equivalent to the adoption of a
 

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:45.950
also equivalent to the adoption of a
responsibility and there's more to it

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:45.960
responsibility and there's more to it
 

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:47.899
responsibility and there's more to it
than that if you can't run away then you

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:47.909
than that if you can't run away then you
 

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:49.760
than that if you can't run away then you
can solve your problems because it might

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:49.770
can solve your problems because it might
 

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:52.999
can solve your problems because it might
be okay well I'm stuck with you so how

00:01:52.999 --> 00:01:53.009
be okay well I'm stuck with you so how
 

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:56.090
be okay well I'm stuck with you so how
about we fix things because the

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:56.100
about we fix things because the
 

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:57.350
about we fix things because the
alternative is we're going to be in a

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:57.360
alternative is we're going to be in a
 

00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:59.080
alternative is we're going to be in a
boxing match for the next 40 years

boxing match for the next 40 years
 

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:02.510
boxing match for the next 40 years
that's the alternative so and you think

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:02.520
that's the alternative so and you think
 

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:03.709
that's the alternative so and you think
you're gonna fix problems without

00:02:03.709 --> 00:02:03.719
you're gonna fix problems without
 

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:05.749
you're gonna fix problems without
something like that hanging over your

00:02:05.749 --> 00:02:05.759
something like that hanging over your
 

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:07.730
something like that hanging over your
head there isn't a chance you'll just

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:07.740
head there isn't a chance you'll just
 

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:09.199
head there isn't a chance you'll just
avoid them because that's what people do

00:02:09.199 --> 00:02:09.209
avoid them because that's what people do
 

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:11.119
avoid them because that's what people do
it's really hard to solve problems

00:02:11.119 --> 00:02:11.129
it's really hard to solve problems
 

00:02:11.129 --> 00:02:12.740
it's really hard to solve problems
especially in a relationship we're

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:12.750
especially in a relationship we're
 

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:13.940
especially in a relationship we're
having a fight and I find out

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:13.950
having a fight and I find out
 

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:15.500
having a fight and I find out
that it's you know because you're you

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:15.510
that it's you know because you're you

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:21.650
five or some goddamn thing you know it's
like it's very frequent that that sort

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:21.660
like it's very frequent that that sort
 

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:23.869

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:27.930
weird anomalous behavior you just can't
 

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:29.420
weird anomalous behavior you just can't
make heads or tails of it it doesn't

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:29.430
make heads or tails of it it doesn't
 

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:31.100
make heads or tails of it it doesn't
seem related to what you're doing at all

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:31.110

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:33.530
seem related to what you're doing at all
they don't want to talk about it and so

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:33.540
they don't want to talk about it and so
 

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:35.059
they don't want to talk about it and so
as soon as you bring it up they get mad

00:02:35.059 --> 00:02:35.069
as soon as you bring it up they get mad
 

00:02:35.069 --> 00:02:36.890
as soon as you bring it up they get mad
and then you bring it up again they even

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:36.900
and then you bring it up again they even
 

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:38.690
and then you bring it up again they even
get madder and they tell you that you're

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:38.700
get madder and they tell you that you're
 

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:39.890

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:39.900
not gonna talk about that or they're
 

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:42.080
not gonna talk about that or they're
gonna leave and so maybe you're really

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:42.090
gonna leave and so maybe you're really
 

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:43.850
gonna leave and so maybe you're really
really persistent because you're kind of

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:43.860
really persistent because you're kind of
 

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:45.350
really persistent because you're kind of
a son of a bitch and then they break

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:45.360
a son of a bitch and then they break
 

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:48.380
a son of a bitch and then they break
down and cry you know and then they have

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:48.390
down and cry you know and then they have
 

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:50.330
down and cry you know and then they have
this horrible memory that comes flooding

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:50.340
this horrible memory that comes flooding
 

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:52.370
this horrible memory that comes flooding
forward that's completely you don't know

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:52.380
forward that's completely you don't know
 

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:53.750
forward that's completely you don't know
what to do with it and then you have to

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:53.760
what to do with it and then you have to
 

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:54.589
what to do with it and then you have to
sort it out

00:02:54.589 --> 00:02:54.599
sort it out
 

00:02:54.599 --> 00:02:56.180
sort it out
so you think you're gonna do that unless

00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:56.190
so you think you're gonna do that unless
 

00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:58.699
so you think you're gonna do that unless
there's a good reason you have to know

00:02:58.699 --> 00:02:58.709
there's a good reason you have to know
 

00:02:58.709 --> 00:03:00.170
there's a good reason you have to know
we better start this out or we're gonna

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:00.180
we better start this out or we're gonna
 

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:01.759
we better start this out or we're gonna
be carrying it around for the next forty

00:03:01.759 --> 00:03:01.769
be carrying it around for the next forty
 

00:03:01.769 --> 00:03:04.430
be carrying it around for the next forty
years that maybe is enough motivation so

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:04.440
years that maybe is enough motivation so
 

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:06.140
years that maybe is enough motivation so
you'll actually try hard to solve a

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:06.150
you'll actually try hard to solve a
 

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:08.589
you'll actually try hard to solve a
problem that's a lot easier to say well

00:03:08.589 --> 00:03:08.599
problem that's a lot easier to say well
