is very difficult when we're using when

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:08.670
is very difficult when we're using when
 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:10.280
is very difficult when we're using when
we're commissioning recipes from around

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:10.290
we're commissioning recipes from around
 

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:11.870
we're commissioning recipes from around
the world because they're also using

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:11.880
the world because they're also using
 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:14.030
the world because they're also using
different measurements and grams and

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:14.040
different measurements and grams and
 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:16.310

that chef might not have converted it

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:16.320
that chef might not have converted it
 

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:18.649
that chef might not have converted it
correctly so it can be very challenging

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:18.659
correctly so it can be very challenging
 

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:20.390
correctly so it can be very challenging
but that's why we do go through such a

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:20.400
but that's why we do go through such a
 

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:24.140
but that's why we do go through such a
rigorous testing of recipes
