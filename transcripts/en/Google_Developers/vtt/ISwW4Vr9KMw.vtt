[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:05.090 --> 00:00:06.475
My name is Pavol Magic.

00:00:06.475 --> 00:00:09.055
I come from a
company called Sygic.

00:00:09.055 --> 00:00:11.720
And I work there, as
a product manager.

00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:16.650
Speedometer by Sygic is
one of our newest apps.

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:20.070
Our vision is to
keep commuters safe.

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:24.380
We started, last year, as
a team of five people--

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:27.180
myself, a product manager,
a testing specialist,

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:30.160
and three developers.

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:32.630
And we basically had no budget.

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:34.380
We just got some goals.

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:38.500
We needed to start the
app as soon as possible.

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:42.420
So we started developing
it in September, last year.

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:46.720
And the first app,
the Android version

00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:48.050
was released in December.

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:50.380
So it was really fast.

00:00:50.380 --> 00:00:51.590
It wasn't perfect.

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:54.310
So it was basically
a lean startup.

00:00:54.310 --> 00:00:57.540
This helps us build
innovative products.

00:00:57.540 --> 00:01:02.920
Because our core product
is Sygic GPS Navigation.

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:07.810
And it's basically 10 years
old, the same as the company.

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:13.420
So it's quite tricky
to bring innovations

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:16.050
in a product this old.

00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:18.170
So you always have
to think of ways

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:21.640
how to create new
products, new projects.

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:23.450
And this was one of
the ways how to do it.

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:26.690
Because we have
three projects like

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:29.020
this going on in our company.

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:31.790
So Speedometer is one of them.
