Speaker 1:          00:00          I guess the Cliche is the modern, the modern left, whatever people call it. Like the, you know, capital l tribal left seems to be being indoctrinated not by left wing policy ideas. It's not about necessarily socialism, it's about identity. Arianism it's about policy based on your immutable characteristics and how, you know, like going back to the green new deal, like in the bill it talks about racial equity, what does that do to the environment? But what does it mean? Um, well equality would be like, ew, ew. Equal opportunity to, people are allowed to try and if one succeeds, congratulations, equity would be, well let's determine whether or not you are advantaged or privileged and then hold you back or push you forward based on these, these certain metrics. I suppose it's, it's the problem I have with it is that it's not quantifiable. So this was actually something that was really shocking to me.

Speaker 1:          00:50          I was sitting with my niece, uh, and my, my sister, my niece and my mom and I showed this image that people like to share. It's three people standing up by a baseball of offense. And there's a base is a baseball game as a really short person who can't see. There is a medium sized person who can see a little bit and a very tall person who just stands right up above the fence. It says this is equality. Each of them gets one crate, one crate isn't enough for the short guy and the two guys can already see. I says this is equity and it shows the short guy getting, you know, three crates so they can all see now. And I said, the problem is when it comes to someone's height, sure we can understand, let's, let's, let's give the the crates to the short guy so he can see along with us.

Speaker 1:          01:30          But how do you determine equity based on the color of someone's skin or they're, you know, like characteristics that can't necessarily be quantified. Right? So when Alexandria Ocozzio Cortez pushes a bill forward that's purporting to be about the environment, but includes racial equity clauses, are we to assume that her ideology states that if you are not white, you are poor by deaf? Like it's a guarantee or do we have to assume that each individual has different advantages, different cards to play, and some are born wealthy, some aren't. And yes, there's historic racism, but we can't make those assumptions. Right? Right. So this is, this is, to me, one of the biggest problems I've been having as like a lifelong left-leaning individuals. Who do I vote for her? Right? I was a big fan of Bernie Sanders for awhile, but then Bernie Sanders gets up on stage at the debates and says, white people don't know what it's like to be poor.

Speaker 1:          02:14          Well, that's hilarious. W Go to fucking West Virginia and visit the coal miners. Right? And you know what's really weird? I saw one of Bernie's tweets that I looked at and I said, oh, come on man. You know, this is fucked up. He was talking about how much more money white men make than black women and Latino men and all these different things. And what he didn't include was Asian men. Well, because Asian men make more money. But here's what I think a lot of people on the right miss. He said pay equity, not pay equality. Okay. I think perhaps we should stop assuming they don't know what they're saying because a lot of people assume what they're saying is, you know, the, the gender, the gender earnings gap is, is real. But the gender pay gap, it's um, that if a man and a woman are both offered the exact same job, exact same experience in education, women tend to get, I think it's like three to 5% less.

Speaker 1:          03:08          And many people believe that's because they, they're less likely to negotiate. Just why you have like lean in, tell women to be more, you know, trying to be more assertive. Um, but it's not this 77% number that's, but there is an earnings gap, right? The median salaries of men and women are different. So when Bernie says white men make x more than these other demographics, he said in his tweet, pay equity, not equality. He doesn't want fair pay for everyone based on job. He's actually saying, it doesn't matter what job you have, everyone should be paid the same. Yeah, that's nonsense. But then you see what Cortez releases on our website. If you're unwilling to work, they'll provide economic security. They actually mine, I believe they took it off the site. Right? But I think when they included in the bill that they want equity, not equality when they include on their website.

Speaker 1:          03:54          If you're unwilling, they'll pay you. And when Bernie says equity as well, I think they're not talking about equality. Like I don't think you know, the average American understands what they're actually saying is you should be paid a flat rate period. And when you're talking about the pay gap being different from men and women, we should clarify that. What you're saying essentially is that men choose different jobs and they work more hours. And that's the reason why they make that much more money where it's 77 cents on the dollar. Yeah. There. There was a, an another study came out recently that said that hours worked was almost the, uh, 100% of the reason why men and women earn different, uh, at a median median salary. In some areas a women actually earn more than men. Uh, and there's I think seven cities. I think this was on pew again, you, you fact check me if you got you, everybody thinks I'm wrong or whatever.

Speaker 1:          04:38          But uh, I believe it was seven cities where women out earn men by like seriously high numbers, like up to 20%. So there's a lot of issues when it comes to the pay gap and equality. But without going on a tangent in that area, I think what ends up happening is, you know, I saw Bernie's tweet and I responded to it by saying good news, Bernie pay equality is enshrined in law. And I signed it. I cited three examples of where it's illegal to discriminate based on gender. And then someone pointed out to me, Tim, he didn't say quality is said equity. That would imply it doesn't matter what job you have. A petroleum engineer should earn the same as a store clerk at h and m that's equity that just because you have an advantage because if education doesn't mean you should earn more than somebody else.

Speaker 1:          05:19          You see what I'm saying? So the fact that there's people that actually believe that, that don't believe that w w w first of all, that's going to absolutely discourage people from trying to succeed. Why would you, if you could get the same amount as the CEO of Exxon as you can working at 21 forever, forever 21 or whatever, Abercrombie and Fitch, why would you, why would you try hard? Why would you exceed? Why would you succeed? Why would you excel? I think it's fair to point out some people would you know what if there's no, if there's no real, I mean other than social status, if there's no reveal real consequences. I think social status might be one of the prime driving factors of, of most people. I don't know, man. Not Enough. Not enough to really encourage innovation and progress. I can agree with that.

Speaker 1:          06:07          For sure. But I also think there's a, there was a saying that I was told a lot that people don't get rich because they want money, they get rich because they're passionate about something and the money comes after, you know, they always say that the money comes after something like that. And I'd point out every, every day I take no days off. It's been a couple of years with me not taking any days off. I work literally every day full time. Right now I'm producing six youtube videos every day. Only one of them is a real seven days a week, seven days a week, nonstop for two years straight. Fuck you doing it yourself. I like it. It's fun. And that's a thing. I'm not, I'm not doing it. You're enjoying this old lady down the tunnel. I do it because, you know, I see things on, uh, so for the most part on, on my main youtube channel, I do one video every day at 4:00 PM, which tends to be just like a news analysis piece.

Speaker 1:          06:48          But I'm not perfect. Sometimes I, you know, get all hyperbolic and stuff. My second channel is me just ranting and you know, not really swearing but still just like heavy opinion stuff. I do it because it's fun. You know, I see something, I want to explore it. Uh, I used to travel all the time. You know, when I worked at vice, I was in all these different countries and all these dangerous places. Not because I wanted to have a name for myself, not because I wanted to make money, I wanted to watch a revolution. I want to know why it was happening and I want to talk to the people who are experiencing it. So I can, I can, I can relate to people who say money isn't a motivator for sure. But I've also talked to people in Scandinavia who have told me they sort of give up at a certain point because I can't remember which country it was.

Speaker 1:          07:27          It may have been Sweden or uh, or Norway. But these two women told me that after like $77,000 per year, they tax like 80% of your income. So people just stop. They literally just stopped. That's another proposition, right? This is something else that's been discussed in terms of anyone who makes more than x amount per year, taxing them over 70% I agree with the progressive tax wholeheartedly. I disagree with a number that high. What do you think it should be? I don't, I don't know. But I will say we need more progressive brackets. We need to keep going. And you know, I gotta say maybe, maybe at $10 million 70% does make sense. But I kind of leaned towards not really, cause it seems like man, that's a lot of money. That's a lot. That's, that's, that's more, that's, that's ridiculous amount. You know, I think Steve Bannon said something like a five in front of it or something.

Speaker 1:          08:14          But I don't know. I'm not an economist, but I do believe a progressive tax makes the most sense. And I can explain it to you if you want to hear it. Sure. So there was a study, I believe it was from Harvard, you need $77,000 per year, as may have been 10 years ago, in order to be middleclass median in the United States. That means if you make 77,000 you'll have a vacation, you'll have insurance, you'll have a car, you can raise a family, you can send them to school, all that stuff, but you have nothing left over for savings. You have nothing left over for investments. If you make $100,000 a year, you're gonna have $23,000 leftover for investing. Eventually. At a certain point, if you only need $77,000 if you're making 10 million, you've got 9,000,900 900,000 that you can invest and just be independently wealthy and be rich forever.

Speaker 1:          08:58          Now, I have no problem with being wealthy. I have no, I have no problem with other people being wealthy and living off of their investments and all that. But there is a point where you have to realize the, the, the coalescing of power, the monopolizing of power is a really dangerous thing for any society to few individuals holding too much power can destabilize an economy, can destabilize a country. The problem with communism, you snap your fingers and you put a centralized authority in place. At least that's how it's been every single time. And then they hold all the cards and they can oppress over, they want the problem with laissez faire. Capitalism has over time, which is why it's better in a lot of ways over time. It eventually becomes a centralized oligopoly of a few corporations controlling everything, which we're kind of seeing now.

Speaker 1:          09:36          So all the progressive tax can really do is slow that process down, which I think is a good thing. But ultimately I think just looking at the system, eventually you end up kind of where we are, where six media companies control everything. And then, you know, some companies are the biggest funders of certain politicians and corporations is to have too much power. I mean, there, there is, uh, I, I remember reading a report or a story about how wealthy people have like three or four times more ability to influence a politician than like the majority of the people in the country simply because paying for expensive dinners and lobbying earns you favors, you know, super pacs paying, you know, guaranteeing funding for, for a politician earns your favors. So it's, you know, look, if a million people tell me they want you know, x, but the people who are paying me like pa funding my campaign are paying me more.

Speaker 1:          10:26          Well, who am I going to provide favors too? And then once I'm done with my campaign run, I can go to job at their company. Yet these are problems. So without going on too big of a rant, I think ultimately a progressive tax can help slow the process down of special interests, acquiring too much power. Eventually it happens anyway. But with a flat tax, you're basically saying at a certain point you can just keep dumping more and more money into different investments, making more and more money and increasing your power exponentially and other people can't catch up to you and then power becomes too quick. Right? Yeah.

Speaker 2:          10:57          I think in this country we tried to look at success and achievement is something that everyone's striving for and we don't want to put any restrictions on that. Yeah, we look at capitalism is the reason why everything's going so great over here. This is America. Atlanta, the free home of the brave go out there and kick ass. We're not going to saddle you now with debt. Um, but it makes sense that after a while as we're seeing today, but I don't mean what is, what's the best way to do it? I mean is not going to work. What does work?

Speaker 1:          11:26          I think a mixed economy, well mixed economy where we are right now, right? A portion of income is paid in taxes from government programs for the, for the, um, for defense and things like that. I just think we have a big problem with corruption. I think we've got bloat. I think we've got government agencies that instead of reforming and breaking them down, we just slept more bandaids on top. Yeah, we've got a festering wound and we're putting bandages over bandages. You know, it's like a certain point you got to Redo it. We also have systems that are in place that, I mean, in terms of like the way communities have always existed in certain communities, there's just poverty and crime and no one does anything to fix it. Right. And it seems to be that we'll, we're more than willing to go to other countries and nation built were more than willing to pump money into different countries, especially if they have natural resources.

Speaker 1:          12:15          But in our own country, we're not, I mean, the, the greatest resources of course human beings and the best way to make America great or stronger would be to have less losers. Well, what's the best way to have less losers? To have more people succeed? What's the best way to have more people succeed? Give them more opportunity and chance to not be stuck in a quagmire, not be trapped in a ghetto. This is, yeah. So, uh, I believe we should allocate access from other areas to improve the certain areas. In that sense, I believe in socialism to a certain extent. Like I will leave in it with, with fire departments. I believe in it with the police department. I believe we should spend money that comes out of, you know, the public pool to fix things. Right. I look at New York, there are some neighborhoods that are really bad, some neighborhoods that are really good.

Speaker 1:          12:57          Well, if we take access from the really great neighborhoods and use that to fix roads, pay for schools in poor neighborhoods, crime is one of the biggest correlations for crimes. Poverty. Yes. So if we can get better schools, we need to reform the school system straight up. If we can get better hospitals, if you can fix the roads, then we're doing a lot to reduce crime and we're just poverty. And a rising tide lifts all ships. Yes. So that's why, you know, I, that's why I like Bernie Sanders, although I will, I say I make sure, I tell people like, he has a little too left for me. He is, but when we're, when we're looking at who we had in 2016 I was like, yeah, Bernie's my guy.
