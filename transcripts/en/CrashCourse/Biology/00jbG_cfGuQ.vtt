00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:06.600
Oh, hello there. I'm at the gym. I don't know
why you're here, but I'm going to do some

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:08.559
pushups, so you can join me on the floor if
you want.

00:00:08.559 --> 00:00:13.610
Now, I'm not doing this to show off or anything.
I'm actually doing this for science.

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:14.500
[pained grunt]

00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:16.760
You see what happened there?

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:21.039
My arms moved, my shoulders moved, my back
and stomach muscles moved, my heart pumped

00:00:21.039 --> 00:00:23.440
blood to all those different places. Pretty
neat, huh?

00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:28.220
Well, it turns out that how we make and use
energy is a lot like sports or other kinds of exercise

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:32.640
It can be hard work and a little bit complicated
but if you do it right, it can come with some

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:33.340
tremendous payoffs.

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:37.260
But unlike hitting a ball with a stick, it's
so marvelously complicated and awesome that

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:40.940
we're still unraveling the mysteries of
how it all works. And it all starts with a

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:47.940
marvelous molecule that is one of you best
friends: ATP.

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:59.370
Today I'm talking about energy and the process
our cells, and other animal cells, go through

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:01.309
to provide themselves with power.

00:01:01.309 --> 00:01:06.729
Cellular respiration is how we derive energy
from the food we eat--specifically from glucose,

00:01:06.729 --> 00:01:09.310
since most of what we eat ends up as glucose.

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:13.119
Here's the chemical formula for one molecule
of glucose [C6H12O6]. In order to turn this

00:01:13.119 --> 00:01:18.399
glucose into energy, we're going to need
to add some oxygen. Six molecules of it, to be exact.

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:22.619
Through cellular respiration, we're going
to turn that glucose and oxygen into 6 molecules

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:29.400
of CO2, 6 molecules of water and some energy
that we can use for doing all our push ups.

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:33.140
So that's all well and good, but here's
the thing: We can't just use that energy

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:37.590
to run a marathon or something. First our
bodies have to turn that energy into a really

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:43.710
specific form of stored energy called ATP,
or adenosine triphosphate. You've heard

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:48.869
me talk about this before. People often refer
to ATP as the "currency" of biological energy.

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:53.110
Think of it as an American dollar--it's
what you need to do business in the U.S. You

00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:58.970
can't just walk into Best Buy with a handful
of Chinese yen or Indian rupees and expect

00:01:58.970 --> 00:02:03.189
to be able to buy anything with them, even
though they are technically money. Same goes

00:02:03.189 --> 00:02:07.439
with energy: In order to be able to use it,
our cells need energy to be transferred into

00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:12.799
adenosine triphosphate to be able to grow,
move, create electrical impulses in our nerves

00:02:12.799 --> 00:02:17.609
and brains. Everything. A while back, for
instance, we talked about how cells use ATP

00:02:17.609 --> 00:02:22.260
to transport some kinds of materials in and
out of its membranes; to jog your memory about

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:23.980
that you can watch it right here.

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:29.299
Now before we see how ATP is put together,
let's look at how cells cash in on the energy

00:02:29.299 --> 00:02:30.790
that's stashed in there.

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:35.249
Well, adenosine triphosphate is made up of
an nitrogenous base called adenine with a

00:02:35.249 --> 00:02:39.209
sugar called ribose and three phosphate groups
attached to it:

00:02:39.209 --> 00:02:43.370
Now one thing you need to know about these
3 phosphate groups is that they are super

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:48.949
uncomfortable sitting together in a row like
that -- like 3 kids on the bus who hate each

00:02:48.949 --> 00:02:50.620
other all sharing the same seat.

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:54.150
So, because the phosphate groups are such
terrible company for each other, ATP is able

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:57.900
to do this this nifty trick where it shoots
one of the phosphates groups off the end of

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:03.049
the seat, creating ADP, or adenosine diphosphate
(because now there are just two kids sitting

00:03:03.049 --> 00:03:08.159
on the bus seat). In this reaction, when the
third jerk kid is kicked off the seat, energy is released.

00:03:08.159 --> 00:03:12.509
And since there are a lot of water molecules
just floating around nearby, an OH pairing

00:03:12.509 --> 00:03:16.779
-- that's called a hydroxide -- from some
H2O comes over and takes the place of that

00:03:16.779 --> 00:03:19.279
third phosphate group. And everybody is much
happier.

00:03:19.279 --> 00:03:23.109
By the way? When you use water to break down
a compound like this, it's called hydrolysis

00:03:23.109 --> 00:03:26.549
-- hydro for water and lysis, from the Greek
word for "separate."

00:03:26.549 --> 00:03:31.919
So now that you know how ATP is spent, let's
see how it's minted -- nice and new -- by

00:03:31.919 --> 00:03:33.309
cellular respiration.

00:03:33.309 --> 00:03:38.040
Like I said, it all starts with oxygen and
glucose. In fact, textbooks make a point of

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:43.309
saying that through cellular respiration,
one molecule of glucose can yield a bit of

00:03:43.309 --> 00:03:48.449
heat and 38 molecules of ATP. Now, it's worth
noting that this number is kind of a best

00:03:48.449 --> 00:03:53.599
case scenario. Usually it's more like 29-30
ATPs, but whatever -- people are still studying

00:03:53.599 --> 00:03:55.989
this stuff, so let's stick with that 38
number.

00:03:55.989 --> 00:03:59.319
Now cellular respiration isn't something
that just happens all at once -- glucose is

00:03:59.319 --> 00:04:05.479
transformed into ATPs over 3 separate stages:
glycolysis, the Krebs Cycle, and the electron

00:04:05.479 --> 00:04:10.059
transport chain. Traditionally these stages
are described as coming one after the other,

00:04:10.059 --> 00:04:13.409
but really everything in a cell is kinda happening
all at the same time.

00:04:13.409 --> 00:04:18.759
But let's start with the first step: glycolysis,
or the breaking down of the glucose.

00:04:18.759 --> 00:04:23.060
Glucose, of course, is a sugar--you know this
because it's got an "ose" at the end

00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:28.650
of it. And glycolysis is just the breaking
up of glucose's 6 carbon ring into two 3-carbon

00:04:28.650 --> 00:04:31.569
molecules called pyruvic acids or pyruvate
molecules.

00:04:31.569 --> 00:04:36.840
Now in order to explain how exactly glycolysis
works, I'd need about an hour of your time,

00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:41.389
and a giant cast of finger puppets each playing
a different enzyme, and though it would pain

00:04:41.389 --> 00:04:44.039
me to do it, I'd have to use words like
phosphoglucoisomerase.

00:04:44.039 --> 00:04:51.039
But one simple way of explaining it is this:
If you wanna make money, you gotta spend money.

00:04:51.710 --> 00:04:56.970
Glycolysis needs the investment of 2 ATPs
in order to work, and in the end it generates

00:04:56.970 --> 00:05:00.389
4 ATPs, for a net profit, if you will, of
2 ATPs.

00:05:00.389 --> 00:05:07.340
In addition to those 4 ATPs, glycolysis also
results in 2 pyruvates and 2 super-energy-rich

00:05:07.340 --> 00:05:13.400
morsels called NADH, which are sort of the
love-children of a B vitamin called NAD+ pairing

00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:19.259
with energized electrons and a hydrogen to
create storehouses of energy that will later

00:05:19.259 --> 00:05:21.240
be tapped to make ATP.

00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:25.210
To help us keep track of all of the awesome
stuff we're making here, let's keep score?

00:05:25.210 --> 00:05:31.599
So far we've created 2 molecules of ATP
and 2 molecules of NADH, which will be used

00:05:31.599 --> 00:05:33.469
to power more ATP production later.

00:05:33.469 --> 00:05:38.219
Now, a word about oxygen. Like I mentioned,
oxygen is necessary for the overall process

00:05:38.219 --> 00:05:43.759
of cellular respiration. But not every stage
of it. Glycolysis, for example, can take place

00:05:43.759 --> 00:05:46.500
without oxygen, which makes it an anaerobic
process.

00:05:46.500 --> 00:05:51.419
In the absence of oxygen, the pyruvates formed
through glycolysis get rerouted into a process

00:05:51.419 --> 00:05:56.659
called fermentation. If there's no oxygen
in the cell, it needs more of that NAD+ to

00:05:56.659 --> 00:06:01.789
keep the glycolysis process going. So fermentation
frees up some NAD+, which happens to create

00:06:01.789 --> 00:06:03.280
some interesting by products.

00:06:03.280 --> 00:06:09.060
For instance, in some organisms, like yeasts,
the product of fermentation is ethyl alcohol,

00:06:09.060 --> 00:06:15.569
which is the same thing as all of this lovely
stuff. But luckily for our day-to-day productivity,

00:06:15.569 --> 00:06:19.639
our muscles don't make alcohol when they
don't get enough oxygen. If that were the

00:06:19.639 --> 00:06:24.219
case, working out would make us drunk, which
actually would be pretty awesome, but instead

00:06:24.219 --> 00:06:30.499
of ethyl alcohol, they make lactic acid. Which
is what makes you feel sore after that workout

00:06:30.499 --> 00:06:31.360
that kicked your butt.

00:06:31.360 --> 00:06:35.629
So, your muscles used up all the oxygen they
had, and they had to kick into anaerobic respiration

00:06:35.629 --> 00:06:40.159
in order to get the energy that they needed,
and so you have all this lactic acid building

00:06:40.159 --> 00:06:45.749
up in your muscle tissue.

00:06:45.749 --> 00:06:52.180
Back to the score. Now we've made 2 molecules
of ATP through glycolysis, but your cells

00:06:52.180 --> 00:06:56.520
really need the oxygen in order to make the
other 30-some molecules they need.

00:06:56.520 --> 00:07:01.180
That's because the next two stages of cellular respiration
-- the Krebs Cycle and the electron transport

00:07:01.180 --> 00:07:06.930
chain, are both aerobic processes, which means
they require oxygen.

00:07:06.930 --> 00:07:12.469
And so we find ourselves at the next step
in cellular respiration after glycolosis:

00:07:12.469 --> 00:07:13.099
the Krebs Cycle.

00:07:13.099 --> 00:07:17.360
So, while glycolysis occurs in the cytoplasm,
or the fluid medium within the cell that all

00:07:17.360 --> 00:07:23.599
the organelles hang out in, the Krebs Cycle
happens across the inner membrane of the mitochondria,

00:07:23.599 --> 00:07:27.870
which are generally considered the power centers
of the cell. The Krebs Cycle takes the products

00:07:27.870 --> 00:07:33.419
of glycolysis -- those carbon-rich pyruvates
-- and reworks them to create another 2 ATPs

00:07:33.419 --> 00:07:38.009
per glucose molecule, plus some energy in
a couple of other forms, which I'll talk

00:07:38.009 --> 00:07:39.419
about in a minute. Here's how:

00:07:39.419 --> 00:07:43.009
First, one of the pyruvates is oxidized, which
basically means it's combined with oxygen.

00:07:43.009 --> 00:07:47.689
One of the carbons off the three-carbon chain
bonds with an oxygen molecule and leaves the

00:07:47.689 --> 00:07:53.789
cell as CO2. What's left is a two-carbon
compound called acetyl coenzyme A, or acetyl

00:07:53.789 --> 00:07:59.569
coA. Then, another NAD+ comes along, picks
up a hydrogen and becomes NADH. So our two

00:07:59.569 --> 00:08:03.729
pyruvates create another 2 molecules of NADH
to be used later.

00:08:03.729 --> 00:08:09.550
As in glycolysis, and really all life, enzymes
are essential here; they're proteins that

00:08:09.550 --> 00:08:13.990
bring together the stuff that needs to react
with each other, and they bring it together

00:08:13.990 --> 00:08:19.969
in just the right way. These enzymes bring
together a phosphate with ADP, to create another

00:08:19.969 --> 00:08:25.900
ATP molecule for each pyruvate. Enzymes also
help join the acetyl coA and a 4-carbon molecule

00:08:25.900 --> 00:08:27.930
called oxaloacetic acid.

00:08:27.930 --> 00:08:30.360
I think that's how you pronounce it.

00:08:30.360 --> 00:08:35.579
Together they form a 6-carbon molecule called
citric acid, and I'm certain that's how you

00:08:35.579 --> 00:08:42.579
pronounce that one because that's the stuff
that's in orange juice.

00:08:44.110 --> 00:08:48.990
Fun fact: The Krebs Cycle is also known as
the Citric Acid Cycle because of this very

00:08:48.990 --> 00:08:55.320
byproduct. But it's usually referred to by
the name of the man who figured it all out:

00:08:55.320 --> 00:09:01.480
Hans Krebs, an ear nose and throat surgeon
who fled Nazi Germany to teach biochemistry

00:09:01.480 --> 00:09:07.360
at Cambridge, where he discovered this incredibly
complex cycle in 1937. For being such a total

00:09:07.360 --> 00:09:11.860
freaking genius, he was awarded the Nobel
Prize in Medicine in 1953.

00:09:11.860 --> 00:09:17.310
Anyway, the citric acid is then oxidized over
a bunch of intricate steps, cutting carbons

00:09:17.310 --> 00:09:22.860
off left and right, to eventually get back
to oxaloacetic acid, which is what makes the

00:09:22.860 --> 00:09:28.810
Krebs Cycle a cycle. And as the carbons get
cleaved off the citric acid, there are leftovers

00:09:28.810 --> 00:09:34.620
in the form of CO2 or carbon dioxide , which
are exhaled by the cell, and eventually by

00:09:34.620 --> 00:09:41.269
you. You and I, as we continue our existence
as people, are exhaling the products of the

00:09:41.269 --> 00:09:44.190
Krebs Cycle right now. Good work.

00:09:44.190 --> 00:09:49.050
This video, by the way, I'm using a lot
of ATPs making it.

00:09:49.050 --> 00:09:54.360
Now, each time a carbon comes off the citric
acid, some energy is made, but it's not

00:09:54.360 --> 00:09:59.779
ATP. It's stored in a whole different kind
of molecular package. This is where we go

00:09:59.779 --> 00:10:04.000
back to NAD+ and its sort of colleague FAD.

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:09.550
NAD+ and FAD are both chummy little enzymes
that are related to B vitamins, derivatives

00:10:09.550 --> 00:10:13.560
of Niacin and Riboflavin, which you might
have seen in the vitamin aisle. These B vitamins

00:10:13.560 --> 00:10:18.730
are good at holding on to high energy electrons
and keeping that energy until it can get released

00:10:18.730 --> 00:10:22.670
later in the electron transport chain. In
fact, they're so good at it that they show

00:10:22.670 --> 00:10:27.279
up in a lot of those high energy-vitamin powders
the kids are taking these days.

00:10:27.279 --> 00:10:32.649
NAD+s and FADs are like batteries, big awkward
batteries that pick up hydrogen and energized

00:10:32.649 --> 00:10:37.350
electrons from each pyruvate, which in effect
charges them up. The addition of hydrogen

00:10:37.350 --> 00:10:40.889
turns them into NADH and FADH2, respectively.

00:10:40.889 --> 00:10:47.889
Each pyruvate yeilds 3 NADHs and 1 FADH2 per
cycle, and since each glucose has been broken

00:10:49.300 --> 00:10:56.240
down into two pyruvates, that means each glucose
molecule can produce 6 NADHs and 2 FADH2s.

00:10:56.240 --> 00:11:02.199
The main purpose of the Krebs Cycle is to
make these powerhouses for the next and final

00:11:02.199 --> 00:11:04.259
step, the Electron Transport Chain.

00:11:04.259 --> 00:11:09.360
And now's the time when you're saying, "Sweet
pyruvate sandwiches, Hank, aren't we supposed

00:11:09.360 --> 00:11:12.009
to be making ATP? Let's make it happen,
Capt'n! What's the holdup?"

00:11:12.009 --> 00:11:17.329
Well friends, your patience has paid off,
because when it comes to ATPs, the electron

00:11:17.329 --> 00:11:22.279
transport chain is the real moneymaker. In
a very efficient cell, it can net a whopping

00:11:22.279 --> 00:11:23.490
34 ATPs.

00:11:23.490 --> 00:11:29.709
So, remember all those NADHs and FADH2s we
made in the Krebs Cycle? Well, their electrons

00:11:29.709 --> 00:11:34.680
are going to provide the energy that will
work as a pump along a chain of channel proteins

00:11:34.680 --> 00:11:39.339
across the inner membrane of the mitochondria
where the Krebs Cycle occurred. These proteins

00:11:39.339 --> 00:11:44.600
will swap these electrons to send hydrogen
protons from inside the very center of the

00:11:44.600 --> 00:11:47.759
mitochondria, across its inner membrane to
the outer compartment of the mitochondria.

00:11:47.759 --> 00:11:52.970
But once they're out, the protons want to
get back to the other side of the inner membrane,

00:11:52.970 --> 00:11:57.990
because there's a lot of other protons out
there, and as we've learned, nature always

00:11:57.990 --> 00:12:02.440
tends to seek a nice, peaceful balance on
either side of a membrane. So all of these

00:12:02.440 --> 00:12:07.079
anxious protons are allowed back in through
a special protein called ATP synthase. And

00:12:07.079 --> 00:12:11.870
the energy of this proton flow drives this
crazy spinning mechanism that squeezes some

00:12:11.870 --> 00:12:17.380
ADP and some phosphates together to form ATP.
So, the electrons from the 10 NADHs that came

00:12:17.380 --> 00:12:22.639
out of the Krebs Cycle have just enough energy
to produce roughly 3 ATPs each.

00:12:22.639 --> 00:12:28.519
And we can't forget our friends the FADH2s.
We have two of them and they make 2 ATPs each.

00:12:28.519 --> 00:12:34.240
And voila! That is how animal cells the world
over make ATP through cellular respiration.

00:12:34.240 --> 00:12:39.420
Now just to check, let's reset our ATP counter
and do the math for a single glucose molecule

00:12:39.420 --> 00:12:40.029
once again:

00:12:40.029 --> 00:12:44.100
We made 2 ATPs for each pyruvate during glycolysis.

00:12:44.100 --> 00:12:45.829
We made 2 in the Krebs Cycle.

00:12:45.829 --> 00:12:49.989
And then during the electron transport chain
we made about 34 in the electron transport chain.

00:12:49.989 --> 00:12:56.139
And that's just for one molecule of glucose.
Imagine how much your body makes and uses

00:12:56.139 --> 00:12:57.240
every single day.

00:12:57.240 --> 00:13:02.060
Don't spend it all in one place now! You
can go back and watch any parts of this episode

00:13:02.060 --> 00:13:08.100
that you didn't quite get and I really want
to do this quickly because I'm getting very tired.

00:13:08.110 --> 00:13:12.350
