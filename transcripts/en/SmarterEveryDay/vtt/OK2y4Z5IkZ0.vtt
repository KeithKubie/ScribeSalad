00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:03.520
Hey, it's me Destin, welcome back to Smarter Every Day. I love Ready Player One.

00:00:03.520 --> 00:00:09.280
It's a fascinating book about this virtual world called The Oasis, based here in Columbus Ohio.

00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:11.740
If we're ever gonna get to a virtual world,

00:00:11.740 --> 00:00:15.080
We have to have ways to interact with that virtual world with our bodies. ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:20.100
So this is the first episode of a series on technology like this, here on Smarter Every Day.

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:24.240
We're gonna go test-drive a virtual haptic glove.

00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:26.220
It's not virtual, it's an actual haptic glove,

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:30.100
But it's a way for you to use your physical body to interact with a virtual world.

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:34.320
So let's go to California, to a company called Haptx because there's an engineer,

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:36.540
I have questions about how such a glove would work.

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:40.180
There can only be a certain amount of resolution that should... Yeah, questions.

00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:42.280
Let's go to California

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:44.840
- You're Kenan, right?

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:45.500
- I'm Kenan.

00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:48.340
- So what's going on here? What do we have?

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:53.080
- So we have our glove prototype, which is called Glens,

00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:57.780
And we have a HTC Vive and a computer to drive the experience.

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:02.080
- You're tracking where the glove is in 360 degrees. Okay.

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:03.300
- I think you should just try it.

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:04.420
- Just try it?
- Yeah.
- Okay.

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:06.740
- It'll make so much more sense to you if you...
- Alright. Let's do it.

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:09.100
- Put your hand in it like this, keeping your fingers tight.

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:13.940
And then once you kind of pass like, this area, you'll spread your fingers out and...

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:17.220
Into the finger sockets.
- Okay.

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:21.600
- Alright you're not officially doing VR until you have a bucket on the head, so now that we got that on me,

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:24.030
We are ready to go. Let's enter the simulation.

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:26.860
- [Faint] So you hear things through the headphones.

00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:31.480
- Yes, I hear... 
- Music?
- I hear music that makes me want to take a nap.

00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:33.860
- Do you hear the rain and...
- And I hear lightning.

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:35.500
- Yeah. This is good, stick you hand out and..

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:39.120
[Voiceover] This is the exact moment I realized that they've done something amazing.

00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:44.100
I'm not a VR believer, but you can actually feel each individual raindrop in your hand.

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:50.300
It's not wet or anything like that, but it's perfectly timed, perfectly positioned, and your brain accepts it.

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:52.400
- Feel free to explore the environment

00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:56.360
- I can pick which finger I want to feel it on,

00:01:56.940 --> 00:02:00.060
Hold on. I'm trying to I'm trying to feel individual raindrops now. Hold on.

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:02.520
- You definitely can.
- Can you really?

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:08.820
Okay, so it's directional,

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:13.720
So you're having to do...

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:16.860
You're doing a coordinate transformation for the hand,

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:20.260
Oh look at you, you put a logo on the back of a hand! You guys are clever.
 [chuckles]

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:22.360
Oh I moved it! :D

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:30.580
Okay, I feel like a kid, this is pretty cool. Alright, so I can move...

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:34.740
- You can just explore and anything, feel free to touch anything that you can see where it is.

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:36.980
- I can just touch all this stuff.
- Yep.

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:42.120
- So I can move this lighthouse. Oh, I'm not... Oh! I'm not far enough in the 3D world.

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:45.380
That's crazy.

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:52.860
Oh it's getting harder to...

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:59.140
That's the force-feedback you're talking about. It's pulling on the back of my finger.

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:02.120
- Yep.

00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:14.220
- So you have to model the curvature of a finger. Can I actually...

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:18.520
What's that noise I hear? Do I hear static?

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:23.540
[Voiceover] Up to this point in the simulation, I'm just feeling things with my hand.

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:27.700
But this glove has something called force feedback. If you look on the back of the fingers,

00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:32.760
There's this tape that can hold your fingers in one position. And when I finally picked up a rock,

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:35.660
This is the moment where everything clicked.

00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:36.940
- So, can I come over here to pick up a rock?

00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:44.500
[laugh] Alright. Alright I'm cool. Alright.

00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:51.860
I heard a tractor. Hey! Alright,

00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:55.920
You don't have gravity in your simulation?

00:03:57.380 --> 00:03:59.480
Oh, that was... OK, that was rad dude.

00:04:03.020 --> 00:04:04.000
This is...

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:09.480
Alright, who made this simulation?

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:11.820
- Kenan and Johnathan.

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:17.040
Both of whom are standing over here.

00:04:17.700 --> 00:04:19.560
- Kenan and Jonathan made this?
- Yeah.

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:25.100
- Okay, this is really cool. What did you make the simulation in?

00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:27.980
- Unreal Engine. Four.

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:32.900
- Whoa, whoa, leave my sunflowers alone.

00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:38.740
- You might need to re...
- No, we're good.
- ...re-grow them.

00:04:39.660 --> 00:04:43.920
- Regrow the sunflowers? I need a cloud or something.

00:04:45.380 --> 00:04:48.800
Can I shake some water out of it... Yeah, I can! [laugh]

00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:55.040
Ken and Jonathan make the simulation?
- It's Kenan.

00:04:55.040 --> 00:04:57.760
- Kenan! I'm sorry I'm having a hard time hearing you I got the headphones in.

00:04:58.160 --> 00:05:01.520
So, good job Keenan for this. Oh, what's up?

00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:03.740
Hello, guy.

00:05:05.740 --> 00:05:11.980
- So if you reach your hand out palm face up close to the fox he'll actually jump in.

00:05:11.980 --> 00:05:13.400
- Can I stand up?
- Yeah.

00:05:13.720 --> 00:05:18.500
Okay, so I've got a cable here I've got to be careful about, right?
- Yeah, you're good.

00:05:19.400 --> 00:05:24.720
- Okay, so I'm gonna submit. In Zelda, I'm used to killing every fox I see, so I'm gonna be really nice to this fox.

00:05:25.400 --> 00:05:27.580
- You can try to kill it, it's pretty hard tough.

00:05:32.580 --> 00:05:34.080
- Oh, you can feel it walking around!

00:05:35.020 --> 00:05:36.220
You're a genius.

00:05:37.720 --> 00:05:40.320
Did I point to you Kenan?
- Roughly.

00:05:41.220 --> 00:05:42.260
- Kenan you're a genius.

00:05:44.520 --> 00:05:45.800
I really want to use my other hand.

00:05:47.340 --> 00:05:52.300
You guys need... That is cool as mess man. What's up ?

00:05:53.780 --> 00:06:00.100
I don't, like... what do you... I mean like if a puppy is sleeping on you you're not allowed to move.

00:06:01.580 --> 00:06:06.120
- How do you feel about spiders?
- Spiders? I'm cool with virtual spiders.

00:06:07.360 --> 00:06:08.620
Spiders are not my favorite.

00:06:08.980 --> 00:06:13.800
- But you are cool with virtual spiders.
- Yeah, have you had people freak out doing this?

00:06:13.820 --> 00:06:15.760
- Yep.
- Have you really?

00:06:15.760 --> 00:06:20.540
- One time we didn't ask... big burly military guys like a rocket bombing

00:06:21.960 --> 00:06:28.020
- The haptic feedback is incredible, so...
- The spider man blurred the line between hurtful and real.

00:06:30.500 --> 00:06:34.200
- That's... okay, so what's so cool about this is...

00:06:34.780 --> 00:06:38.560
How many different sensors do you have in the palm? Because I'm feeling every leg.

00:06:38.940 --> 00:06:41.960
- A hundred and twenty in the total glove.
- A hundred and twenty?

00:06:42.400 --> 00:06:44.080
- Some of those are in the fingers.

00:06:44.080 --> 00:06:46.900
- Okay, so how on earth...

00:06:48.040 --> 00:06:52.980
How on earth are you controlling 120 different bladders inside my palm?

00:06:54.740 --> 00:07:00.520
Without just crazy... So, these are not bangbang actuators, these are...

00:07:03.040 --> 00:07:08.460
These are... what was the term? It's like they're infinitely variable actuators.

00:07:09.660 --> 00:07:12.480
- They're pretty continuous, yeah.
- Continuous, thank you.

00:07:14.280 --> 00:07:16.680
- The nice about air, we can control the pressure of them.

00:07:19.060 --> 00:07:21.400
It's way cooler than I thought it would be, I'm gonna be honest.

00:07:23.260 --> 00:07:28.942
I thought it would be cool, but it doesn't take long for your brain to just totally engage with it, does it?

00:07:28.942 --> 00:07:31.340
I'm gonna sit this spider. Oops, my bad, spider.

00:07:36.920 --> 00:07:37.880
Gonna sit you right here.

00:07:40.660 --> 00:07:45.520
- So now that you have become appointed with our virtual farm, are you ready to defend it?

00:07:46.020 --> 00:07:48.140
- Defend the virtual farm? Heck yeah, let's do this.

00:07:48.140 --> 00:07:51.280
- Alright. Smack, squeeze...( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)

00:07:53.540 --> 00:07:55.060
- Oh, you actually have to get there.

00:08:01.260 --> 00:08:03.720
This is like way cooler than I thought it would be.

00:08:11.100 --> 00:08:13.460
There's no way this is gonna translate to video.

00:08:15.280 --> 00:08:21.520
And I'm totally against VR. Just to be clear, I don't think it's gonna catch on, but this has changed my mind.

00:08:22.680 --> 00:08:24.860
- That's awesome.
- Seriously.

00:08:25.380 --> 00:08:29.440
- So go ahead and reach out for that confetti. It should feel a little lighter than anything else you've touched so far.

00:08:29.740 --> 00:08:32.480
- Yes, you're right. It is a continuous actuator.

00:08:34.540 --> 00:08:38.620
You've gotta tell me how you did these bladders. I have to know that.

00:08:38.820 --> 00:08:40.219
[Voiceover] Okay. That's pretty much it.

00:08:40.219 --> 00:08:43.699
That's the experience with the glove, but I'll say this: in the next video,

00:08:43.860 --> 00:08:47.510
We're going to talk to every single engineer that was in the shop that day.

00:08:47.510 --> 00:08:53.740
We're gonna figure all this stuff out, so it's obvious there's motion tracking. It's obvious there's little bumps happening on your fingers

00:08:54.060 --> 00:08:58.660
It's also obvious that something's making your fingers resist motion. So in the next video,

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:00.940
We're gonna cover all this stuff.

00:09:00.940 --> 00:09:06.640
I'm gonna be straight up with you. I thought VR was stupid, and this changes it for me

00:09:07.280 --> 00:09:11.320
Because It's another layer on top of the other stuff going on in your brain.

00:09:11.320 --> 00:09:14.980
So I always thought moving around in a virtual world didn't make a lot of sense.

00:09:15.120 --> 00:09:19.720
But I think this is gonna matter, so I don't know exactly what it's gonna look like in the end

00:09:20.400 --> 00:09:23.680
But this is a really good base concept.

00:09:23.680 --> 00:09:26.800
And I'm excited to see what they do to get this to market,

00:09:26.800 --> 00:09:30.000
Because all the variables are being taken into account at this point in time,

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:34.100
And I don't think they were in the past, so I'm excited about this. Anyway,

00:09:34.280 --> 00:09:38.340
If you enjoyed this episode I would appreciate it if you would support Smarter Every Day

00:09:38.340 --> 00:09:43.460
By supporting the sponsor, which is Audible. You can do that by going to audible.com/smarter

00:09:43.460 --> 00:09:46.640
And getting a 30 day free trial of Audible. It's fantastic

00:09:46.660 --> 00:09:51.300
I recommend Ready Player One which is obviously why I started thinking about haptics in general.

00:09:51.300 --> 00:09:57.100
So if you want to support Smarter Every Day you can also, to the number 500-500, text the word smarter

00:09:57.100 --> 00:09:59.560
And you'll get that 30-day free trial of Audible.

00:09:59.680 --> 00:10:03.340
That's gonna help Smarter Every Day if you do that, and that's going to help me continue to fly places like this

00:10:03.840 --> 00:10:05.500
To make really cool videos like this.

00:10:06.089 --> 00:10:11.779
Okay, this is the haptic glove. I have another piece of man-machine interface technology

00:10:11.780 --> 00:10:16.540
that's in the Oasis and Ready Player One type stuff in an upcoming video.

00:10:16.540 --> 00:10:20.640
So feel free to subscribe to Smarter Every Day if you want to see that. I think you'll enjoy that as well.

00:10:20.640 --> 00:10:24.380
Anyway, I'm Destin you're getting smarter every day. Have a good one. Bye

00:10:26.100 --> 00:10:30.720
So real quick I've been talking with Leigh, and you you're in charge of this this whole facility, right?

00:10:31.020 --> 00:10:33.660
- I'm one of the people who helps make things happen, yeah.

00:10:33.660 --> 00:10:37.720
- Okay, so he was telling me that people can actually come work here. Because you need engineers?

00:10:37.720 --> 00:10:41.460
- We do.
- So you're gonna give me a link and I'll leave it below.

00:10:41.460 --> 00:10:45.900
- Uh-huh.
- And people can come work on this project if they want to.

00:10:45.900 --> 00:10:52.720
- Yeah haptx.com/careers
- Okay, we're here in California. It's a it's a rad place. This is real-deal engineering.

00:10:52.720 --> 00:10:56.120
So anyway, I'll leave a link for you. Awesome.

00:10:56.260 --> 00:10:58.260
- Pull that knob out.
- Pull it out?

00:10:58.260 --> 00:11:04.440
- Yeah. Uh, yeah. And then...
- Oh god, I though I broke it for a second, I though that I'd broke it! [laughs]
