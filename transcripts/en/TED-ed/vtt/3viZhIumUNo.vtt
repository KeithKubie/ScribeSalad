00:00:06.789 --> 00:00:11.612
You’re overseeing the delivery 
of crucial supplies to a rebel base

00:00:11.612 --> 00:00:14.404
deep in the heart of enemy territory.

00:00:14.404 --> 00:00:19.924
To get past Imperial customs, all
packages must follow a strict protocol:

00:00:19.924 --> 00:00:23.825
if a box is marked with 
an even number on the bottom,

00:00:23.825 --> 00:00:27.333
it must be sealed with a red top.

00:00:27.333 --> 00:00:30.594
The boxes are already being loaded 
onto the transport

00:00:30.594 --> 00:00:32.897
when you receive an urgent message.

00:00:32.897 --> 00:00:36.480
One of the four boxes 
was sealed incorrectly,

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:38.699
but they lost track of which one.

00:00:38.699 --> 00:00:41.913
All the boxes are still 
on the conveyor belt.

00:00:41.913 --> 00:00:45.186
Two are facing down: 
one marked with a four,

00:00:45.186 --> 00:00:46.619
and one with a seven.

00:00:46.619 --> 00:00:48.496
The other two are facing up:

00:00:48.496 --> 00:00:49.865
one with a black top,

00:00:49.865 --> 00:00:52.196
another with a red one.

00:00:52.196 --> 00:00:54.764
You know that any violation 
of the protocol

00:00:54.764 --> 00:01:00.596
will get the entire shipment confiscated
and put your allies in grave danger.

00:01:00.596 --> 00:01:05.517
But any boxes you pull off for inspection
won’t make it onto this delivery run,

00:01:05.517 --> 00:01:09.443
depriving the rebels 
of critically needed supplies.

00:01:09.443 --> 00:01:13.592
The transport leaves in a few moments,
with or without its cargo.

00:01:13.592 --> 00:01:18.258
Which box or boxes should you 
grab off the conveyor belt?

00:01:18.258 --> 00:01:23.260
Pause the video now if you want
to figure it out for yourself!

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:25.135
Answer in: 3

00:01:25.135 --> 00:01:26.243
Answer in: 2

00:01:26.243 --> 00:01:27.745
Answer in: 1

00:01:27.745 --> 00:01:31.149
It may seem like you need to inspect 
all four boxes

00:01:31.149 --> 00:01:33.529
to see what’s on the other side of each.

00:01:33.529 --> 00:01:36.400
But in fact, only two of them matter.

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:38.318
Let’s look at the protocol again.

00:01:38.318 --> 00:01:42.602
All it says is that even-numbered boxes 
must have a red top.

00:01:42.602 --> 00:01:45.626
It doesn’t say anything 
about odd-numbered boxes,

00:01:45.626 --> 00:01:48.632
so we can just ignore 
the box marked with a seven.

00:01:48.632 --> 00:01:51.089
What about the box with a red top?

00:01:51.089 --> 00:01:54.457
Don’t we need to check 
that the number on the bottom is even?

00:01:54.457 --> 00:01:56.548
As it turns out, we don’t.

00:01:56.548 --> 00:02:00.413
The protocol says that 
if a box has an even number,

00:02:00.413 --> 00:02:02.805
then it should have a red top.

00:02:02.805 --> 00:02:07.930
It doesn’t say that only boxes 
with even numbers can have red tops,

00:02:07.930 --> 00:02:11.650
or that a box with a red top 
must have an even number.

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:15.254
The requirement 
only goes in one direction.

00:02:15.254 --> 00:02:17.871
So we don’t need 
to check the box with the red lid.

00:02:17.871 --> 00:02:21.569
We do, however, 
need to check the one with the black lid,

00:02:21.569 --> 00:02:26.120
to make sure it wasn’t incorrectly 
placed on an even-numbered box.

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:30.065
If you initially assumed the rules 
imply a symmetrical match

00:02:30.065 --> 00:02:33.881
between the number on the box 
and the type of lid, you’re not alone.

00:02:33.881 --> 00:02:37.764
That error is so common,
we even have a name for it:

00:02:37.764 --> 00:02:39.890
affirming the consequent,

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:42.676
or the fallacy of the converse.

00:02:42.676 --> 00:02:44.606
This fallacy wrongly assumes

00:02:44.606 --> 00:02:48.632
that just because a certain condition 
is necessary for a given result,

00:02:48.632 --> 00:02:51.159
it must also be sufficient for it.

00:02:51.159 --> 00:02:54.911
For instance, having an atmosphere 
is a necessary condition

00:02:54.911 --> 00:02:56.893
for being a habitable planet.

00:02:56.893 --> 00:02:59.850
But this doesn’t mean that 
it’s a sufficient condition –

00:02:59.850 --> 00:03:05.231
planets like Venus have atmospheres 
but lack other criteria for habitability.

00:03:05.231 --> 00:03:08.143
If that still seems hard 
to wrap your head around,

00:03:08.143 --> 00:03:11.028
let’s look at 
a slightly different problem.

00:03:11.028 --> 00:03:13.746
Imagine the boxes contain groceries.

00:03:13.746 --> 00:03:16.643
You see one marked for shipment 
to a steakhouse

00:03:16.643 --> 00:03:19.042
and one to a vegetarian restaurant.

00:03:19.042 --> 00:03:22.326
Then you see two more boxes 
turned upside down:

00:03:22.326 --> 00:03:24.324
one labeled as containing meat,

00:03:24.324 --> 00:03:26.961
and another as containing onions.

00:03:26.961 --> 00:03:29.123
Which ones do you need to check?

00:03:29.123 --> 00:03:30.298
Well, it’s easy –

00:03:30.298 --> 00:03:33.781
make sure the meat isn’t being shipped 
to the vegetarian restaurant,

00:03:33.781 --> 00:03:37.054
and that the box going there 
doesn’t contain meat.

00:03:37.054 --> 00:03:39.146
The onions can go to either place,

00:03:39.146 --> 00:03:43.204
and the box bound for the steakhouse 
can contain either product.

00:03:43.204 --> 00:03:45.417
Why does this scenario seem easier?

00:03:45.417 --> 00:03:47.626
Formally, it’s the same problem –

00:03:47.626 --> 00:03:50.277
two possible conditions
for the top of the box,

00:03:50.277 --> 00:03:51.882
and two for the bottom.

00:03:51.882 --> 00:03:55.652
But in this case, they’re based on 
familiar real-world needs,

00:03:55.652 --> 00:03:59.844
and we easily understand that 
while vegetarians only eat vegetables,

00:03:59.844 --> 00:04:02.394
they’re not the only ones who do so.

00:04:02.394 --> 00:04:05.777
In the original problem,
the rules seemed more arbitrary,

00:04:05.777 --> 00:04:08.004
and when they’re abstracted that way,

00:04:08.004 --> 00:04:11.463
the logical connections 
become harder to see.

00:04:11.463 --> 00:04:14.946
In your case, you’ve managed 
to get enough supplies through

00:04:14.946 --> 00:04:17.583
to enable the resistance 
to fight another day.

00:04:17.583 --> 00:04:20.200
And you did it by thinking 
outside the box –

00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:21.849
both sides of it.
