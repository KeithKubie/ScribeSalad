00:00:00.690 --> 00:00:03.590
In this video, we're going to
explore how we can start with

00:00:03.590 --> 00:00:04.840
acetic acid.

00:00:08.870 --> 00:00:11.420
And acetic acid looks
like this.

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:25.220
And end up with acetyl chloride
that looks like this.

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:30.210
And it's going to
be done in the

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:32.520
presence of thionyl chloride.

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:35.080
And thionyl chloride, we haven't
seen it before, but it

00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:35.980
just looks like this.

00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:38.930
It's a sulfur double bonded
to an oxygen.

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:42.130
And then, it has single bonds
to two separate chlorines.

00:00:42.130 --> 00:00:44.080
And then, if you want
to care, sulphur

00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:45.830
has six valence electrons.

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:48.720
So it has another lone
pair right over here.

00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:49.760
And we'll focus on this.

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:53.920
Because this is really the
simplest reaction of starting

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:57.610
with a carboxylic acid and
forming a acyl halide.

00:00:57.610 --> 00:00:59.520
And it can be generalized
very easily.

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:02.160
If you turn this methyl group
into just a larger chain, and

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:04.599
then this will be a larger
chain right here.

00:01:04.599 --> 00:01:07.000
And, instead of having a
chlorine here, you could do it

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:08.670
with other halides as well.

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:12.070
So let's think about how
this might occur.

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:15.460
So let's have our acetic
acid right over here.

00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:23.045
And then, you have this oxygen
bonded to a hydrogen.

00:01:26.980 --> 00:01:31.550
Now, this guy has got
two lone pairs.

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:33.950
And then the thionyl chloride--
I'll redraw the

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:37.320
thionyl chloride right
over here.

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:40.760
And I'll set it up in
the right position.

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:43.600
The thionyl chloride
looks like this.

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:48.270
And this has a lone pair of
electrons right over here.

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:51.580
And all of these molecules,
chlorine, and oxygen-- or all

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:53.570
of these atoms-- chlorine and
oxygen-- we can look at a

00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:55.220
periodic table up here.

00:01:55.220 --> 00:01:57.020
You see sulphur over here.

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:59.260
And then, to the right of
sulphur is chlorine.

00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:01.020
And above sulphur is oxygen.

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:03.660
So both chlorine and
oxygen are more

00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:05.980
electronegative than sulfur.

00:02:05.980 --> 00:02:11.470
So sulphur is going to have a
partial positive charge there,

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:13.710
even though sulphur is a
reasonably electronegative

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:14.790
atom in its own right.

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:17.170
But these other guys are
going to be sucking

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:19.180
electronic away from it.

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:25.200
So you could imagine this entire
molecule could act as a

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:29.720
nucleophile, with this oxygen,
right over here, giving an

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:32.970
electron to the sulphur.

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:35.470
Sulphur is an electronegative
atom, but it has a partial

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:37.950
positive charge in just
this thionyl cholride.

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:39.590
So it will be attracted there.

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:43.060
And then this guy is going to
have to give up an electron.

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:46.280
And he'll give it back to
this oxygen up there.

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:48.520
And so that will be-- and
this reaction could

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:49.480
go in either direction.

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:52.530
So, once again, I'll draw
it in equilibrium.

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:56.020
But right after that happens,
we'll have this, I guess we

00:02:56.020 --> 00:02:58.520
could call it a complex, that
will look like this.

00:02:58.520 --> 00:03:02.320
This oxygen, it had
two lone pairs.

00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:04.560
It had one pair, two pairs.

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:09.370
And now, it has a third pair,
because it got this electron.

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:11.870
It always had that other
electron in the covalent bond.

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:15.090
And now, it has a
negative charge.

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:17.425
And now, the sulphur is bonded
to those two chlorines.

00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:23.890
And then, it is also bonded
to this oxygen over here.

00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:25.000
So let me draw it over here.

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:30.550
So we have this oxygen, which
is bonded to this carbonyl

00:03:30.550 --> 00:03:33.790
carbon, just like that.

00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:37.410
And then, it is bonded to a
hydrogen right over there.

00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:38.940
It has one lone pair now.

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:42.380
And the other lone pair is, now,
turned into a covalent

00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:43.880
bond with the sulfur.

00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:48.470
And so this guy gave
away an electron.

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:50.755
So he now has a positive
charge.

00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:58.850
Now, the next step, you could
imagine that this oxygen says,

00:03:58.850 --> 00:04:01.610
hey, I liked having a double
bond with the sulfur.

00:04:01.610 --> 00:04:06.360
The sulfur is still bonded to
a bunch of things that are

00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:07.380
more electronegative to it.

00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:11.430
It still has a slightly
positive charge there.

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:16.730
So you could imagine that this
electron gets given back to

00:04:16.730 --> 00:04:17.470
the sulfur.

00:04:17.470 --> 00:04:20.070
But then, the sulfur needs
to bump an electron.

00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:23.850
Chlorine is pretty
electronegative, so one of

00:04:23.850 --> 00:04:27.900
these chlorines will be able
to take away an electron.

00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:31.620
So this chlorine could take
away an electron.

00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:34.980
So then, after that happens,
our situation-- and once

00:04:34.980 --> 00:04:37.700
again, this is in equilibrium--
our situation

00:04:37.700 --> 00:04:39.856
will look like this.

00:04:39.856 --> 00:04:40.780
Let me draw.

00:04:40.780 --> 00:04:45.420
So let me draw the original
acetic acid.

00:04:45.420 --> 00:04:48.810
Or the part that was part of
the original acetic acid.

00:04:48.810 --> 00:04:53.140
And so you have this oxygen,
right over here, bonded to a

00:04:53.140 --> 00:04:56.670
hydrogen, bonded to-- let me do
it in the same color so we

00:04:56.670 --> 00:05:02.190
can keep track of things--
bonded to this sulphur right

00:05:02.190 --> 00:05:05.590
over here, which now has a
double bond, which, now again,

00:05:05.590 --> 00:05:08.140
has a double bond with
this oxygen up here.

00:05:08.140 --> 00:05:09.810
So I'll do it in that
same color.

00:05:09.810 --> 00:05:12.080
It's still bonded to that
chlorine up there.

00:05:16.690 --> 00:05:17.840
But now, this chlorine
is left.

00:05:17.840 --> 00:05:19.170
It has taken that electron
with it.

00:05:19.170 --> 00:05:24.310
So the chlorine had 1, 2, 3, 4,
5, 6, 7 valence electrons.

00:05:24.310 --> 00:05:27.920
It gained this electron,
this orange electron.

00:05:27.920 --> 00:05:31.410
So now, it has a negative
charge.

00:05:31.410 --> 00:05:33.110
And, by the way, this
guy never lost

00:05:33.110 --> 00:05:34.350
his positive charge.

00:05:34.350 --> 00:05:38.260
Still has a positive
charge like that.

00:05:38.260 --> 00:05:43.460
Now, the chlorine could act
as a nucleophile on

00:05:43.460 --> 00:05:44.990
the carbonyl carbon.

00:05:44.990 --> 00:05:49.080
This guy is bonded to two
oxygens, more elctronegative,

00:05:49.080 --> 00:05:50.770
partially positive charge.

00:05:50.770 --> 00:05:55.340
This guy can give an electron
to the carbonyl carbon.

00:05:55.340 --> 00:06:00.590
And right as that happens, this
is a nucleophilc attack,

00:06:00.590 --> 00:06:04.720
the carbonyl carbon can
give up an electron to

00:06:04.720 --> 00:06:06.200
the carbonyl oxygen.

00:06:06.200 --> 00:06:11.040
And then, we will be
in equilibrium.

00:06:11.040 --> 00:06:13.380
So make sure you realize we're
going to the right then down.

00:06:13.380 --> 00:06:16.810
Now, we're going to the
left with this thing.

00:06:16.810 --> 00:06:22.350
So this was the carbonyl carbon
bonded to this oxygen

00:06:22.350 --> 00:06:24.330
right now, which now, just
took another electron.

00:06:24.330 --> 00:06:26.310
So now, it has a negative
charge.

00:06:26.310 --> 00:06:29.930
It had 1, 2 lone pairs.

00:06:29.930 --> 00:06:31.880
And now, it will have one
more lone pair because

00:06:31.880 --> 00:06:34.740
it took that electron.

00:06:34.740 --> 00:06:36.770
It always had this
end of that bond.

00:06:36.770 --> 00:06:39.310
So now it has both of these
electrons over here.

00:06:39.310 --> 00:06:40.390
It has a negative charge.

00:06:40.390 --> 00:06:42.310
It gained an electron.

00:06:42.310 --> 00:06:46.595
And then, it is bonded it to
this OH group right over here.

00:06:50.730 --> 00:07:00.250
And then that is bonded to the
sulfur, which is bonded to the

00:07:00.250 --> 00:07:06.120
chlorine, and now double bonded
to that other oxygen.

00:07:06.120 --> 00:07:08.280
Of course, we have this chlorine
over here that did

00:07:08.280 --> 00:07:10.100
the nucleophilic attack.

00:07:10.100 --> 00:07:12.610
So you have this chlorine
over here.

00:07:12.610 --> 00:07:16.550
And this nucleophilc attack,
it gave an electron to what

00:07:16.550 --> 00:07:18.390
was this carbonyl carbon.

00:07:18.390 --> 00:07:19.300
It gave an electron.

00:07:19.300 --> 00:07:20.740
So it is now neutral.

00:07:20.740 --> 00:07:23.250
And you can kind of imagine that
this negative charge got

00:07:23.250 --> 00:07:25.590
transferred to this
oxygen up here.

00:07:25.590 --> 00:07:29.670
And this oxygen, right here,
still has a positive charge.

00:07:29.670 --> 00:07:31.280
Don't want to forget that.

00:07:31.280 --> 00:07:34.180
Now, the next step that could
happen-- once again, all these

00:07:34.180 --> 00:07:37.080
can go in either direction-- is
that this guy doesn't like

00:07:37.080 --> 00:07:38.400
having a negative charge.

00:07:38.400 --> 00:07:41.020
And this guy is still going to
have a partially positive

00:07:41.020 --> 00:07:43.430
charge, because he's bonded
to a bunch of more

00:07:43.430 --> 00:07:45.810
electronegative atoms
than itself.

00:07:45.810 --> 00:07:49.280
So he wants to reform
the double bond.

00:07:49.280 --> 00:07:53.650
And that kicks off all of
this business over here.

00:07:53.650 --> 00:07:56.630
So then this-- let me do
this in a new color.

00:07:56.630 --> 00:07:58.140
I've already used the magenta.

00:07:58.140 --> 00:07:59.400
I'll use the pink.

00:07:59.400 --> 00:08:04.630
This electron, right here, gets
taken back by this oxygen

00:08:04.630 --> 00:08:06.120
that had a positive
charge anyway.

00:08:06.120 --> 00:08:07.740
So it would want to
take it back.

00:08:07.740 --> 00:08:15.190
And then we are left with-- and
we're getting pretty close

00:08:15.190 --> 00:08:17.340
to the punchline.

00:08:17.340 --> 00:08:19.180
We are, then, in equilibrium.

00:08:19.180 --> 00:08:21.950
This part over here will
then look like this.

00:08:21.950 --> 00:08:24.060
We now have reformed
our double bond.

00:08:24.060 --> 00:08:26.840
It is only going to
be bonded to the

00:08:26.840 --> 00:08:28.270
chlorine, just like this.

00:08:28.270 --> 00:08:31.370
And this whole part over here
on the right has broken off.

00:08:31.370 --> 00:08:33.740
So you have this oxygen bonded--
let me do it in the

00:08:33.740 --> 00:08:35.419
same colors.

00:08:35.419 --> 00:08:39.549
You have this oxygen bonded
to a hydrogen.

00:08:39.549 --> 00:08:41.459
It now gained an electron.

00:08:44.010 --> 00:08:46.350
So it is now neutral.

00:08:46.350 --> 00:08:49.970
And it is bonded
to this sulfur.

00:08:49.970 --> 00:08:51.720
The sulphur is in green.

00:08:51.720 --> 00:08:57.400
It's bonded to the sulfur, which
is bonded to a chlorine.

00:08:57.400 --> 00:08:59.290
And then, it has a double
bond to this

00:08:59.290 --> 00:09:01.600
oxygen right over here.

00:09:01.600 --> 00:09:04.720
So we've already formed
our acetyl chloride.

00:09:09.660 --> 00:09:12.460
And we've really finished with
the hard part of the

00:09:12.460 --> 00:09:15.180
reaction-- to see that how you
could get an acetyl chloride.

00:09:15.180 --> 00:09:17.670
And then to kind of complete
this reaction-- because if you

00:09:17.670 --> 00:09:20.040
actually perform this in a
beaker, you'll end up with

00:09:20.040 --> 00:09:24.910
some hydrogen chloride and
some sulfur oxide as a

00:09:24.910 --> 00:09:26.100
by-product.

00:09:26.100 --> 00:09:30.790
You could imagine that this
oxygen, right over here, takes

00:09:30.790 --> 00:09:33.190
back its electron from
this proton,

00:09:33.190 --> 00:09:37.120
gives it to this sulfur.

00:09:37.120 --> 00:09:40.240
And then, the sulfur, since it
got an electron, will allow

00:09:40.240 --> 00:09:46.740
the electronegative chlorine
to take back its electron.

00:09:46.740 --> 00:09:48.840
And then, if we just focus on
this, the acetyl chloride, at

00:09:48.840 --> 00:09:50.950
this point, isn't doing
anything anymore.

00:09:50.950 --> 00:09:56.070
This would be in equilibrium
with something

00:09:56.070 --> 00:09:57.330
that looks like this.

00:09:57.330 --> 00:10:00.365
You now have a hydrogen proton
floating around.

00:10:03.570 --> 00:10:05.290
Just a naked proton, really.

00:10:05.290 --> 00:10:08.400
There's not even any
neutrons there.

00:10:08.400 --> 00:10:12.100
You have this oxygen,
which is now double

00:10:12.100 --> 00:10:16.170
bonded with this sulfur.

00:10:16.170 --> 00:10:19.560
So I'm going to try to keep all
of the colors the same.

00:10:19.560 --> 00:10:20.730
This, right here, was yellow.

00:10:20.730 --> 00:10:24.070
And then, that original bond
it had with it was magenta.

00:10:24.070 --> 00:10:26.730
And then, you have the chlorine
nabbed that electron.

00:10:33.810 --> 00:10:36.990
And it already had seven
valence electrons.

00:10:36.990 --> 00:10:41.720
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7. it now
has a negative charge.

00:10:41.720 --> 00:10:43.470
And then, the final step.

00:10:43.470 --> 00:10:47.840
So we already have our
sulphur dioxide.

00:10:47.840 --> 00:10:51.880
Now, the final step is just the
chlorine giving one of its

00:10:51.880 --> 00:10:55.010
electrons to the hydrogen to
form hydrogen chloride.

00:10:55.010 --> 00:10:57.080
So then, the final step
is just this.

00:11:01.450 --> 00:11:05.730
So when all is said and
done, we end up

00:11:05.730 --> 00:11:07.460
with some acetyl chloride.

00:11:12.200 --> 00:11:14.020
We end up with some
hydrogen chloride.

00:11:18.160 --> 00:11:21.540
And we end up with
sulphur dioxide.

00:11:24.980 --> 00:11:26.960
Just like that, and
we're done.

00:11:26.960 --> 00:11:29.660
And, once again, you can
generalize this to get it

00:11:29.660 --> 00:11:34.050
starting with any carboxylic
acid and forming the acyl

00:11:34.050 --> 00:11:36.960
halide version of it, or acyl
chloride version, if you want

00:11:36.960 --> 00:11:40.150
to stick with a chloride
right over here.

00:11:40.150 --> 00:11:44.080
Actually, this, right here,
is acetyl chloride.

00:11:44.080 --> 00:11:47.550
Anyway, hopefully, you found
that entertaining.
