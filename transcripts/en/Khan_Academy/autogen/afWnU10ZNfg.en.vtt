00:00:00.539 --> 00:00:02.611
 I have three scenarios 

00:00:02.611 --> 00:00:05.397
 The cell is immersed in the solution 

00:00:05.397 --> 00:00:07.593
 The cell is purple in color 

00:00:07.593 --> 00:00:09.444
 This is a cell dinner 

00:00:09.444 --> 00:00:11.087
 Water molecules are shown 

00:00:11.087 --> 00:00:14.072
 Blue circles and solubility 

00:00:14.072 --> 00:00:17.295
 Inside the water solution 

00:00:17.295 --> 00:00:18.891
 Shown in yellow circles 

00:00:18.891 --> 00:00:21.422
 Obviously I am overpriced in the volume of water circles 

00:00:21.422 --> 00:00:25.384
 And dissolved molecules relative to cell size 

00:00:25.384 --> 00:00:26.836
 But settled as well as we can imagine 

00:00:26.836 --> 00:00:28.584
 What is happening now? 

00:00:28.584 --> 00:00:30.595
 We assume this cell membrane 

00:00:30.595 --> 00:00:34.405
 This is a biodegradable layer with optional electrophoresis 

00:00:34.405 --> 00:00:37.391
 This allows the water molecules to enter and exit the cell 

00:00:37.391 --> 00:00:39.453
 Thus the water molecules can get out of the cell 

00:00:39.453 --> 00:00:42.330
 Inside or outside the cell inside 

00:00:42.330 --> 00:00:44.025
 But suppose this is not allowed 

00:00:44.025 --> 00:00:46.099
 Soluble molecules 

00:00:46.099 --> 00:00:47.795
 For this reason it has optional access 

00:00:47.795 --> 00:00:50.244
 Certain molecules are allowed to pass 

00:00:50.244 --> 00:00:52.488
 Or appreciate it then say the test permeability 

00:00:52.488 --> 00:00:55.049
 Now what you expect to happen 

00:00:55.049 --> 00:00:57.212
 The first thing is possible for his moment 

00:00:57.212 --> 00:01:00.666
 Concentration dissolved slightly outside the cell 

00:01:00.666 --> 00:01:02.730
 From inside the cell 

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:05.095
 Hence in any moment of time 

00:01:05.095 --> 00:01:07.319
 Some water molecules move in the right direction 

00:01:07.319 --> 00:01:11.894
 Moving from outside the cell into the cell 

00:01:11.894 --> 00:01:13.923
 Also some water molecules are in the right place 

00:01:13.923 --> 00:01:16.452
 As they move from inside the cell to the outside of the cell 

00:01:16.452 --> 00:01:18.058
 But what is the most likely to happen 

00:01:18.058 --> 00:01:19.464
 And what will happen 

00:01:19.464 --> 00:01:21.546
 After a period of time 

00:01:21.546 --> 00:01:23.113
 Water molecules in the outside of the cell 

00:01:23.113 --> 00:01:25.287
 We talked about it in the video characteristic Osmosis 

00:01:25.287 --> 00:01:27.985
 The obstacles will be less than the solute molecules 

00:01:28.662 --> 00:01:31.373
 If this molecule moves in that direction 

00:01:31.373 --> 00:01:33.872
 She was making her way to the membrane 

00:01:33.872 --> 00:01:36.157
 It can cross through the membrane 

00:01:36.157 --> 00:01:39.265
 During this, if this molecule water 

00:01:39.265 --> 00:01:41.460
 He was moving in that direction 

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:43.603
 It will be blocked by solute molecules and it may be rebound 

00:01:43.603 --> 00:01:45.320
 It turns into Shadia 

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:48.184
 Thus the water molecules inside the cell have more obstacles 

00:01:48.184 --> 00:01:51.366
 There is little potential for full interaction with the cell membrane 

00:01:51.366 --> 00:01:53.154
 Or moving to the right direction 

00:01:53.154 --> 00:01:55.791
 They are booked with dissolved particles 

00:01:55.791 --> 00:01:57.013
 Although you will get 

00:01:57.013 --> 00:01:58.902
 Water molecules move back and forth 

00:01:59.874 --> 00:02:01.920
 In a given span of time there is a high probability 

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:04.196
 To enter the cell more than to exit 

00:02:04.196 --> 00:02:06.523
 Thus the flow of water molecules into the cell 

00:02:06.523 --> 00:02:08.376
 Flow of water molecules into the cell 

00:02:10.217 --> 00:02:14.307
 Of H2O water molecules 

00:02:14.307 --> 00:02:17.132
 In a similar case, we talk about his cell 

00:02:17.132 --> 00:02:19.122
 The solution has 

00:02:19.122 --> 00:02:20.799
 Concentration of dissolved molecules is less 

00:02:20.799 --> 00:02:23.870
 It is important to talk about solute molecules 

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:25.704
 Molecule molecules are forbidden to go into the cell membrane 

00:02:25.704 --> 00:02:27.868
 The cell membrane does not allow the dissolved molecules to enter the cell 

00:02:27.868 --> 00:02:30.644
 We call this type of solution 

00:02:30.644 --> 00:02:32.226
 The cell is immersed in it 

00:02:32.226 --> 00:02:34.867
 We name the hypotension solution 

00:02:38.193 --> 00:02:39.980
 Hypotension solution 

00:02:40.495 --> 00:02:42.358
 At any time we talk about a hypotension solution 

00:02:42.358 --> 00:02:44.673
 Or as we shall see, isotonic and hypertonic, 

00:02:46.112 --> 00:02:49.040
 We are relatively oblivious to the concentration of dissolved molecules 

00:02:50.945 --> 00:02:53.628
 Which can not pass through the cellular membrane 

00:02:53.628 --> 00:02:55.894
 The word can be seen in other things 

00:02:55.894 --> 00:02:58.840
 Is a term that means little of Shi and thus in this case 

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:02.875
 We have a concentration of soluble molecules in solution 

00:03:02.875 --> 00:03:05.241
 From inside the cell because of this 

00:03:05.241 --> 00:03:06.914
 You will get a nominal pressure 

00:03:09.704 --> 00:03:12.088
 Molecules of water from outside the cell 

00:03:12.088 --> 00:03:14.591
 Or from the inside of the cell 

00:03:14.591 --> 00:03:17.364
 In fact the pressure will occur on the cell 

00:03:17.364 --> 00:03:20.331
 The cell can expand 

00:03:20.331 --> 00:03:21.633
 If the quantity is enough 

00:03:22.729 --> 00:03:24.873
 It is possible to explode 

00:03:25.245 --> 00:03:27.186
 Now let's go to the other scenario 

00:03:27.186 --> 00:03:29.869
 In this scenario 

00:03:29.869 --> 00:03:32.830
 We have an equal concentration of solubility outside 

00:03:32.830 --> 00:03:35.923
 And inside, I tried to draw them that way 

00:03:35.923 --> 00:03:38.530
 In this case the probability of water molecules 

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:39.966
 In a period of time 

00:03:39.966 --> 00:03:41.886
 To enter from the outside to the inside 

00:03:41.886 --> 00:03:45.086
 Or from the inside out, they would be themselves 

00:03:45.086 --> 00:03:47.972
 So there is no flow inside or outflow 

00:03:47.972 --> 00:03:49.220
 There are always water molecules 

00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:50.470
 You go back and forth but it will not be 

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:52.371
 There will be no inward flow or outflow 

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:55.825
 Let's click, let me type no net 

00:03:55.825 --> 00:03:58.815
 No flow 

00:03:59.686 --> 00:04:01.269
 In this type of solution 

00:04:01.269 --> 00:04:04.113
 Which has the same dissolved concentration in the solution 

00:04:04.113 --> 00:04:08.787
 We will call it isotonic 

00:04:08.787 --> 00:04:10.906
 These are isotonic solutions 

00:04:11.347 --> 00:04:15.105
 Isotonic solution 

00:04:15.792 --> 00:04:19.134
 This term iso refers to equal things 

00:04:19.134 --> 00:04:21.633
 It has the same dissolved concentration 

00:04:21.633 --> 00:04:22.872
 So there is no flow 

00:04:22.872 --> 00:04:26.185
 High tension solution 

00:04:26.185 --> 00:04:28.346
 The molecules of water enter the cell, the cell will expand 

00:04:28.346 --> 00:04:29.791
 Looks like a balloon 

00:04:29.791 --> 00:04:33.030
 Isotonic solution has no flow in it 

00:04:33.030 --> 00:04:35.813
 Of course you can imagine the last scenario 

00:04:35.813 --> 00:04:38.863
 Concentrate the solute higher in the outside of the cell 

00:04:38.863 --> 00:04:40.527
 Therefore there is no cell inside 

00:04:40.527 --> 00:04:42.022
 We can guess what will happen 

00:04:42.022 --> 00:04:43.719
 First, what can we call this 

00:04:43.719 --> 00:04:46.501
 Well, I have more than one thing in the solution, 

00:04:46.501 --> 00:04:48.788
 Thus we will use the above term 

00:04:48.788 --> 00:04:52.355
 I have more, more, over-stress. 

00:04:52.355 --> 00:04:55.539
 This is an overly stressful solution. 

00:04:56.522 --> 00:05:00.287
 Once again, the solute can not cross the cell membrane 

00:05:00.287 --> 00:05:01.943
 But water molecules can 

00:05:01.943 --> 00:05:03.635
 We have water molecules 

00:05:05.822 --> 00:05:07.491
 Go outside the cell into the cell 

00:05:07.491 --> 00:05:09.501
 And from inside the cell to the outside of the cell 

00:05:09.501 --> 00:05:13.138
 But the potential molecules of water are present within the cell 

00:05:13.138 --> 00:05:15.790
 There will be less obstacles to get out of the cell 

00:05:15.790 --> 00:05:18.055
 Thus the molecules water outside the cell will enter 

00:05:18.055 --> 00:05:19.965
 So we have a flow from outside the cell 

00:05:19.965 --> 00:05:21.133
 We have a high probability of molecules coming out of the cell 

00:05:21.133 --> 00:05:24.069
 From inside the cell to the outside 

00:05:24.069 --> 00:05:27.188
 It does things that go from the outside to the inside 

00:05:27.188 --> 00:05:29.392
 Because there will be more obstacles 

00:05:29.392 --> 00:05:32.143
 So they will 

00:05:32.143 --> 00:05:34.593
 In this solution 

00:05:34.593 --> 00:05:38.213
 Water molecules evade the cell, in fact the cell may be withering 

00:05:39.398 --> 00:05:41.331
 Since you lose water pressure 

00:05:41.331 --> 00:05:44.398
 The cell itself can be watered in water 

00:05:44.398 --> 00:05:46.795
 It is possible to see this in a real living device 

00:05:46.795 --> 00:05:48.583
 If you put a red blood cell 

00:05:48.583 --> 00:05:51.092
 In an over-stress solution 

00:05:51.092 --> 00:05:52.900
 Water molecules will accelerate it 

00:05:52.900 --> 00:05:55.329
 And will explode 

00:05:55.329 --> 00:05:58.152
 Will expand 

00:05:58.152 --> 00:06:01.160
 The red cell will be excessively inflated in case of excessive stress 

00:06:01.160 --> 00:06:02.542
 It will naturally be in an isotonic state 

00:06:02.542 --> 00:06:04.206
 Red blood cell 

00:06:04.206 --> 00:06:06.879
 In fact, there is a kind of that little division 

00:06:07.671 --> 00:06:09.568
 In the case in the center 

00:06:09.568 --> 00:06:11.073
 But in the first case it will expand 

00:06:11.073 --> 00:06:12.487
 And in the third case an over-stress solution 

00:06:12.487 --> 00:06:15.106
 Water molecules will evade the red blood cell 

00:06:15.106 --> 00:06:18.592
 Then you will see them wither 

00:06:18.592 --> 00:06:21.196
 A few withers resemble this because 

00:06:23.866 --> 00:06:28.167
 There is an outflow of water molecules
