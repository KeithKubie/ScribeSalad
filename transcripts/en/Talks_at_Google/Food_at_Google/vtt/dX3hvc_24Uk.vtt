INTERVIEWER: So I wondered if we
could just go back a little bit

00:00:08.100 --> 00:00:11.296
and talk about when you
first started writing recipes

00:00:11.296 --> 00:00:13.170
for an audience for the
"Guardian" newspaper,

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:15.940
and when you were asked to
do the vegetarian column,

00:00:15.940 --> 00:00:17.210
you weren't a vegetarian chef.

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:18.460
You were known for vegetables.

00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:20.585
Maybe tell me a little bit,
what were your thoughts

00:00:20.585 --> 00:00:23.704
about having to commit
to the vegetarian lane?

00:00:23.704 --> 00:00:25.370
YOTAM OTTOLENGHI:
Well, I speak about it

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:28.080
in the introduction to
the book "Plenty More."

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:33.225
In a sense, I was slightly
petrified for various reasons.

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:38.840
Well, my biggest
fear was that I would

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:42.340
be pigeonholed as
a vegetarian chef.

00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:47.450
In the world of cooks and
chefs, at least a few years ago,

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:50.660
cooking vegetables was not
very high on the priority list.

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:57.070
Serious chefs, they cook meat,
and the not so serious chefs,

00:00:57.070 --> 00:01:00.460
they cook vegetables.

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:04.019
I'm simplifying it,
but there's a hierarchy

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:07.490
and I didn't want to
be down at the bottom,

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:10.340
or perceived to be
down at the bottom.

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:12.710
The other worry that
I had was that I

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:15.746
was thinking that I've never
written recipes for a living.

00:01:15.746 --> 00:01:17.120
I've been cooking
for many years,

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:21.620
but I was worried that I would
run out of suitable ideas

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:25.350
to share with my "Guardian"
readers every week.

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:28.500
I literally thought that I've
got about four, five, six ideas

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:30.020
and then I'm just
going to run out.

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:32.280
I won't have any more
recipes to write.

00:01:36.010 --> 00:01:38.560
I think it was a
writer's anxiety.

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:40.295
It's my one and only
writer's anxiety.

00:01:40.295 --> 00:01:41.670
I didn't know what
it feels like,

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:43.750
but that's what it
felt like at the time,

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:47.520
so I was slightly
worried about that.

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:51.140
What I write in the introduction
to the book is that in a sense,

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:54.620
I was proven wrong
on both fronts.

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:59.130
For my first concern,
actually, the roles

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:03.640
have almost reversed
in the last few years.

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:05.600
I can't take credit
for this myself,

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:08.750
but I'm probably part
of this change that

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:12.950
has been occurring, that cooking
vegetables, cooking grains

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:16.760
and legumes and lentils and
all those wonderful things

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:23.390
has become much more
appreciated, looked to,

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:26.460
and desirable on all
levels of cooking.

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:28.550
Fancy restaurants,
people at home, everybody

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:30.866
wants to cook more
vegetables and wants

00:02:30.866 --> 00:02:32.490
to do marvelous things
with vegetables.

00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:35.760
And you can go to the high
end, to the Nomas of this world

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:38.890
and to the Nordic
cuisine, which focuses

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:42.120
very much on foraging
local vegetables.

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:44.140
You can go anywhere
and you'll see

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:45.640
that all of a sudden,
the vegetables

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:47.600
have really moved to the center.

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:51.690
And that's a great
thing, and I think we all

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:54.375
know there's various
reasons for that.

00:02:54.375 --> 00:02:59.060
I think the most important
at this point in history

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:01.120
is the fact that eating
vegetables has just

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:03.930
become something that we
can just about imagine

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:07.430
that this world will
be able to support,

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:12.510
and other ways of nurturing
ourselves might not.

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:15.920
With the fear or the anxiety
of running out of ideas,

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:22.140
I think I found myself opening
myself up to the world of food

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:24.770
and all sorts of weird
and wonderful places

00:03:24.770 --> 00:03:30.170
through reading, engaging
with people, and traveling.

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:33.930
I have been obsessing about
all sorts of wonderful places

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:39.400
in the world-- Turkey and Iran
and the Far East, Malaysia,

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:42.465
and Vietnam, places that
I feel have something

00:03:42.465 --> 00:03:45.910
in common with my Middle Eastern
background, the same kind

00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:49.370
of sensibilities when
it comes to food.

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:52.300
I've been celebrating
vegetables ever since.

00:03:52.300 --> 00:03:55.930
I put my anxiety to the side.

00:03:55.930 --> 00:04:00.106
INTERVIEWER: Has been working
on the vegetarian recipes,

00:04:00.106 --> 00:04:01.230
has it changed your palate?

00:04:01.230 --> 00:04:03.730
Has it changed the way
you cook and the way

00:04:03.730 --> 00:04:06.800
you think about creating a dish?

00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:08.990
YOTAM OTTOLENGHI:
I think it has.

00:04:08.990 --> 00:04:12.800
First of all, I really
enjoy being limited.

00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:14.500
I enjoy the challenge
of being limited,

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:17.279
of creating wonderful
flavors without the help

00:04:17.279 --> 00:04:20.490
of a bone or an anchovy,
or all those things

00:04:20.490 --> 00:04:23.010
that have intense,
meaty flavor in them

00:04:23.010 --> 00:04:26.280
and are really good solutions
for cooking and infusing

00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:28.600
flavor.

00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:31.860
Many of us, at least,
know how effective

00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:34.200
a bone is to make
a stock, or how

00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:36.380
fantastical all these
umami flavors are,

00:04:36.380 --> 00:04:37.930
but with vegetarian
cooking, you've

00:04:37.930 --> 00:04:41.500
got an extra challenge to infuse
things with those flavors.

00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:46.020
Hence, I use a lot of
techniques that involve smoking.

00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:49.110
When I say smoking,
it's not that kind

00:04:49.110 --> 00:04:51.434
of fancy schmancy smoking.

00:04:51.434 --> 00:04:53.350
I mean just putting
something on a griddle pan

00:04:53.350 --> 00:04:57.250
with a lot of oil, and hence,
you get quite a lot of smoke

00:04:57.250 --> 00:05:00.740
around whatever you're
grilling, you're smoking.

00:05:00.740 --> 00:05:03.890
Using tons of herbs
and spices and putting

00:05:03.890 --> 00:05:06.380
things in conjunction with
other things that really

00:05:06.380 --> 00:05:08.650
manage to infuse
them with flavor.

00:05:08.650 --> 00:05:10.990
I think what I realized
is with vegetables,

00:05:10.990 --> 00:05:13.625
you just need to work
a little bit harder.

00:05:13.625 --> 00:05:15.250
INTERVIEWER: You
talked about traveling

00:05:15.250 --> 00:05:17.410
a little bit or the different
places you take inspiration

00:05:17.410 --> 00:05:17.910
from.

00:05:17.910 --> 00:05:20.520
I wonder if there's
a region of the world

00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:23.584
or a that you find particularly
inspiring right now,

00:05:23.584 --> 00:05:25.750
that you've been thinking
about a lot or looking to?

00:05:25.750 --> 00:05:27.715
YOTAM OTTOLENGHI: With
this book in particular,

00:05:27.715 --> 00:05:31.930
I'm very focused on
Persian food, Iranian food.

00:05:31.930 --> 00:05:34.160
I think it's a part
of the world that

00:05:34.160 --> 00:05:36.320
hasn't been discovered yet.

00:05:36.320 --> 00:05:38.770
Well, it has been
discovered by many.

00:05:38.770 --> 00:05:40.290
It's not fair what I said.

00:05:40.290 --> 00:05:44.070
But it hasn't been exposed
massively to general,

00:05:44.070 --> 00:05:47.830
to big audience in the West.

00:05:47.830 --> 00:05:49.440
It's the most
wonderful cuisine that

00:05:49.440 --> 00:05:53.350
focuses a lot on ingredients
that I just love,

00:05:53.350 --> 00:05:58.972
things like saffron,
pomegranates, walnuts.

00:05:58.972 --> 00:06:01.480
The Persians, they make
the best rice in the world.

00:06:01.480 --> 00:06:05.080
Forget any other rice and
go and cook Persian rice,

00:06:05.080 --> 00:06:09.500
because the way they cook it
is based on the rice steaming

00:06:09.500 --> 00:06:13.830
with its own residual water
that's left through parboiling,

00:06:13.830 --> 00:06:16.490
and the result is
really magnificent.

00:06:16.490 --> 00:06:19.890
There are really separate grains
of rice, each one is separate.

00:06:19.890 --> 00:06:22.420
And they are absolute
magicians in making

00:06:22.420 --> 00:06:24.102
crusty rice, cooking
what is called--

00:06:24.102 --> 00:06:25.810
INTERVIEWER: Isn't
there a name for that?

00:06:25.810 --> 00:06:27.270
There's a special name.

00:06:27.270 --> 00:06:29.186
YOTAM OTTOLENGHI: Tahdig
is the name for that.

00:06:29.186 --> 00:06:32.270
And then many Iranian
cooks pride themselves

00:06:32.270 --> 00:06:34.840
on the quality of their
tahdig, that crispy thing

00:06:34.840 --> 00:06:37.980
that many of us would
treat as an accident,

00:06:37.980 --> 00:06:39.920
but for them, it's a
very desirable accident.

00:06:39.920 --> 00:06:41.100
It happens every time.

00:06:41.100 --> 00:06:44.310
You really want it to happen
because everybody is just

00:06:44.310 --> 00:06:48.237
grabbing on to pull that bit of
the rice that's stuck and burnt

00:06:48.237 --> 00:06:49.820
a little bit on the
bottom of the pan,

00:06:49.820 --> 00:06:53.030
and there's various
ways to enhance that.

00:06:53.030 --> 00:06:56.667
INTERVIEWER: In "Plenty," there
was a few ingredients or spices

00:06:56.667 --> 00:06:58.250
that you go back to
a lot that I think

00:06:58.250 --> 00:07:00.130
are probably new to
lot of American cooks,

00:07:00.130 --> 00:07:03.150
like sumac or like
pomegranate molasses.

00:07:03.150 --> 00:07:07.540
I'm curious if, in the
new book, were there

00:07:07.540 --> 00:07:10.172
some motifs, these things that
you were going back to a lot

00:07:10.172 --> 00:07:12.000
and using that might
be new to people?

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:12.958
YOTAM OTTOLENGHI: Yeah.

00:07:12.958 --> 00:07:14.900
There's a bunch
of new ingredients

00:07:14.900 --> 00:07:18.010
in "Plenty More" that I've have
been discovering and cooking

00:07:18.010 --> 00:07:20.210
with over the last few years.

00:07:22.730 --> 00:07:24.820
There's quite a few, but
I will mention a couple.

00:07:24.820 --> 00:07:26.491
One of them is black garlic.

00:07:26.491 --> 00:07:28.990
I don't know how many of you
are familiar with black garlic,

00:07:28.990 --> 00:07:30.490
but black garlic
essentially is just

00:07:30.490 --> 00:07:34.580
normal garlic that's gone
through a process of aging over

00:07:34.580 --> 00:07:37.510
a few weeks under
certain conditions

00:07:37.510 --> 00:07:40.420
and at a certain temperature.

00:07:40.420 --> 00:07:43.880
It's actually a technique
that's been developed in Korea.

00:07:43.880 --> 00:07:47.910
It's new, but it's creates
the most fantastic condiment,

00:07:47.910 --> 00:07:51.590
ingredient to use in dressings,
in marinades, and in stews.

00:07:51.590 --> 00:07:55.700
Basically, the garlic cloves
turn from white to black,

00:07:55.700 --> 00:08:00.170
and they take on
the flavors of what

00:08:00.170 --> 00:08:04.800
I can describe as cocoa or
licorice or chocolate or even

00:08:04.800 --> 00:08:08.320
coffee and lose all
their garlickiness.

00:08:08.320 --> 00:08:09.699
It's a real transformation.

00:08:09.699 --> 00:08:12.115
INTERVIEWER: So it's like a
controlled rot, like miso or--

00:08:12.115 --> 00:08:12.400
YOTAM OTTOLENGHI: Yeah.

00:08:12.400 --> 00:08:14.140
It's like all those
wonderful things

00:08:14.140 --> 00:08:16.890
that we love to eat, like wine,
like all sorts of things that

00:08:16.890 --> 00:08:20.770
are absolutely delicious
because of the aging.

00:08:20.770 --> 00:08:22.430
So that is one
ingredient that I'm

00:08:22.430 --> 00:08:24.809
obsessed with at the moment.

00:08:24.809 --> 00:08:26.600
Another ingredient that
I like a lot that's

00:08:26.600 --> 00:08:28.540
in one of the recipes
is called kadaifi.

00:08:28.540 --> 00:08:31.380
It's a type of Arabic pastry.

00:08:31.380 --> 00:08:34.919
Essentially, it's a bit like
shredded wheat in texture

00:08:34.919 --> 00:08:41.520
or like angel hair pasta,
but it's filo pastry.

00:08:41.520 --> 00:08:43.179
It's very easy to
work with, and it's

00:08:43.179 --> 00:08:45.490
got the most unusual texture.

00:08:45.490 --> 00:08:46.880
Normally, in Arabic
cuisine, it's

00:08:46.880 --> 00:08:49.900
used to make baklavas and
all sorts of desserts,

00:08:49.900 --> 00:08:52.050
but I use it in
a savory context.

00:08:52.050 --> 00:08:55.840
It's stuffed with cheese
and burned eggplant filling,

00:08:55.840 --> 00:08:58.900
and then it turns
into little nests.

00:08:58.900 --> 00:09:02.040
And those are put in the
oven, brushed with butter

00:09:02.040 --> 00:09:08.090
and served with a Spanish tomato
sauce that I came up with.

00:09:08.090 --> 00:09:11.767
The beauty of it is that it's
extremely easy to work with.

00:09:11.767 --> 00:09:12.850
You don't need to roll it.

00:09:12.850 --> 00:09:15.540
All these people
with pastry angst

00:09:15.540 --> 00:09:18.630
should go and try to seek
out this Lebanese or Turkish,

00:09:18.630 --> 00:09:22.410
or you can get it from
many shops, pastry.

00:09:22.410 --> 00:09:23.700
It's very hard to fail.

00:09:23.700 --> 00:09:28.870
You need to be really rotten if
you're going to fail in that.

00:09:28.870 --> 00:09:31.880
Everybody can do it.

00:09:31.880 --> 00:09:33.602
INTERVIEWER: One
thing you write about

00:09:33.602 --> 00:09:35.310
in-- I guess it was
the second book here,

00:09:35.310 --> 00:09:37.830
which was "Jerusalem,"
a lot that I thought

00:09:37.830 --> 00:09:41.020
was interesting was about
the ownership of dishes,

00:09:41.020 --> 00:09:43.870
and how different cultures and
different groups in Jerusalem

00:09:43.870 --> 00:09:46.840
and Israel claim
ownership of dishes.

00:09:46.840 --> 00:09:50.660
I would say it's interesting,
and I think in the US,

00:09:50.660 --> 00:09:53.300
it's maybe a little
foreign to us.

00:09:53.300 --> 00:09:56.435
It's not like there's one person
who says, I own the hamburger

00:09:56.435 --> 00:09:58.970
or I own fried chicken.

00:09:58.970 --> 00:10:01.015
I mean, there are people
who have a lot of pride.

00:10:01.015 --> 00:10:02.660
I wonder if you could
talk a little bit more

00:10:02.660 --> 00:10:04.201
about that, about
some of that debate

00:10:04.201 --> 00:10:06.155
over the ownership of dishes.

00:10:06.155 --> 00:10:08.780
YOTAM OTTOLENGHI: It's something
I'm thinking about quite a lot

00:10:08.780 --> 00:10:12.560
because at the moment,
I'm trying to understand

00:10:12.560 --> 00:10:15.040
a bit about the connection
between food and identity

00:10:15.040 --> 00:10:20.140
because lots of my
travels and investigations

00:10:20.140 --> 00:10:24.320
lead me towards this
relationship between food

00:10:24.320 --> 00:10:26.750
and identity.

00:10:26.750 --> 00:10:30.609
I think in what we call
developed countries-- I don't

00:10:30.609 --> 00:10:32.400
think "developed" is
the right description,

00:10:32.400 --> 00:10:35.930
but it's just a way to
bundle them all together--

00:10:35.930 --> 00:10:39.100
the connection between food
and identity, I think somehow

00:10:39.100 --> 00:10:43.410
has been severed, or it just
doesn't exist as much as it

00:10:43.410 --> 00:10:46.770
used to be, for various
reasons, industrialization.

00:10:46.770 --> 00:10:48.150
We all live in cities.

00:10:48.150 --> 00:10:51.470
What we cook is
much less related

00:10:51.470 --> 00:10:56.930
to what our elders have
cooked for us, et cetera.

00:10:56.930 --> 00:11:00.430
I've made a few programs
for Channel Four in the UK,

00:11:00.430 --> 00:11:02.800
where I have been traveling
around the Mediterranean

00:11:02.800 --> 00:11:06.440
and into all sorts of places,
Tunisia, Morocco, Turkey,

00:11:06.440 --> 00:11:11.840
and try to understand the
food through its functions.

00:11:11.840 --> 00:11:17.620
And I realized that essentially,
the common denominator

00:11:17.620 --> 00:11:21.070
to many of the examples
of what I've seen

00:11:21.070 --> 00:11:23.420
is the issue of identity.

00:11:23.420 --> 00:11:27.000
When an identity in these parts
of the world is slightly shaky

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:30.580
or is slightly in threat, than
you hang onto what you like

00:11:30.580 --> 00:11:34.190
or what you know or what you
think will keep your identity.

00:11:34.190 --> 00:11:38.620
Hence what you were talking
about, the sense of ownership.

00:11:38.620 --> 00:11:42.550
When the existence is
haphazard and not safe,

00:11:42.550 --> 00:11:45.240
you hang onto the things that
are very important to you

00:11:45.240 --> 00:11:46.160
and define you.

00:11:46.160 --> 00:11:49.470
I think food is extremely
important in Israel

00:11:49.470 --> 00:11:53.600
and Palestine because the
reality is very shaky.

00:11:53.600 --> 00:11:56.970
So people are very
happy to take ownership,

00:11:56.970 --> 00:11:59.370
or are very willing, or
even willing to fight

00:11:59.370 --> 00:12:02.560
for the ownership of something
that proves that they have

00:12:02.560 --> 00:12:05.370
the right to exist in a certain
way or in a certain place

00:12:05.370 --> 00:12:06.590
or over a certain land.

00:12:06.590 --> 00:12:08.320
I think that comes.

00:12:08.320 --> 00:12:11.410
In writing the book
"Jerusalem," which

00:12:11.410 --> 00:12:14.620
was a fascinating experience
and I loved doing it,

00:12:14.620 --> 00:12:17.900
but you often come
across this area

00:12:17.900 --> 00:12:19.780
where you really need
to tiptoe and make

00:12:19.780 --> 00:12:25.980
sure that you don't take
something from one side

00:12:25.980 --> 00:12:29.302
by describing it as the
food of the other side,

00:12:29.302 --> 00:12:30.260
if you see what I mean.

00:12:30.260 --> 00:12:33.380
That is a very crucial thing.

00:12:33.380 --> 00:12:34.930
But it happens in other places.

00:12:34.930 --> 00:12:37.810
Turkish coffee and Arabic
coffee and Greek coffee

00:12:37.810 --> 00:12:39.930
are essentially the
same, but watch out.

00:12:39.930 --> 00:12:42.040
If you say Arabic
coffee in Turkey,

00:12:42.040 --> 00:12:43.650
they'll chop your head off.

00:12:46.460 --> 00:12:48.010
INTERVIEWER: And
related, I love you

00:12:48.010 --> 00:12:52.290
talk in "Jerusalem,"
about the hummus debate.

00:12:52.290 --> 00:12:57.050
I have to admit, I wasn't aware
that there were sides in this.

00:12:57.050 --> 00:12:58.810
Maybe you could
talk about-- I guess

00:12:58.810 --> 00:13:00.530
there's the chunky
versus the smooth,

00:13:00.530 --> 00:13:03.780
and there's the ratio
of tahini to chickpeas.

00:13:03.780 --> 00:13:06.310
YOTAM OTTOLENGHI: Correct, and
how much lemon juice goes in,

00:13:06.310 --> 00:13:10.760
and whether there's garlic, and
sometimes people put cumin in.

00:13:10.760 --> 00:13:13.940
That is just an extension of
the point that I was making.

00:13:13.940 --> 00:13:19.810
In a sense, hummus is the
national dish of both Israelis

00:13:19.810 --> 00:13:21.800
and Palestinians, so
very uncomfortable

00:13:21.800 --> 00:13:24.519
that warring sides
share a national dish.

00:13:24.519 --> 00:13:25.810
It's not a good starting point.

00:13:31.940 --> 00:13:34.060
But on the other hand,
it's a very telling thing.

00:13:34.060 --> 00:13:38.770
It just shows how close
the sides are in many ways.

00:13:38.770 --> 00:13:45.600
So what I call the hummus wars
are a two faceted kind of war.

00:13:45.600 --> 00:13:48.171
There is the one
war-- maybe "war"

00:13:48.171 --> 00:13:49.920
is a bit of a strong
word in this context,

00:13:49.920 --> 00:13:54.970
but I see it a bit like
that-- is about ownership,

00:13:54.970 --> 00:14:02.970
and that is when you ask, who
was the first to make hummus?

00:14:02.970 --> 00:14:07.240
Of course, the Arabs
around the region,

00:14:07.240 --> 00:14:09.940
whether they're Jordanian,
Palestinian, Lebanese, Syrian,

00:14:09.940 --> 00:14:12.990
would say us.

00:14:12.990 --> 00:14:15.300
I don't think that
is very debatable

00:14:15.300 --> 00:14:16.820
that that is the case.

00:14:16.820 --> 00:14:20.200
But then the Jews in
Israel tend to say, well,

00:14:20.200 --> 00:14:22.680
that's not entirely
true because if you read

00:14:22.680 --> 00:14:25.764
in the Old Testament, and there
is this story where something

00:14:25.764 --> 00:14:28.430
could actually be interpreted as
hummus, although we're not sure

00:14:28.430 --> 00:14:29.470
it's hummus.

00:14:29.470 --> 00:14:33.400
And then you know in Judaism,
we can say a million things

00:14:33.400 --> 00:14:35.470
and debate them quite
a lot without ever

00:14:35.470 --> 00:14:37.212
reaching a conclusion.

00:14:37.212 --> 00:14:38.990
There are those
kind of arguments

00:14:38.990 --> 00:14:42.130
that claim that hummus
was in the Bible.

00:14:42.130 --> 00:14:43.915
But even if it
wasn't in the Bible,

00:14:43.915 --> 00:14:48.580
and even if Esau and
Moses didn't eat hummus,

00:14:48.580 --> 00:14:50.880
there is one thing
that you can agree on,

00:14:50.880 --> 00:14:54.470
is that Jews living in the
Arab world for millennia

00:14:54.470 --> 00:14:56.300
have been eating hummus.

00:14:56.300 --> 00:14:59.330
And then it's very hard to say
that hummus is Muslim and not

00:14:59.330 --> 00:15:03.021
Jewish because the
cultures were interacting.

00:15:03.021 --> 00:15:04.270
This is the historical debate.

00:15:04.270 --> 00:15:06.150
That's one aspect.

00:15:06.150 --> 00:15:10.280
The other aspect is, and that's
much less serious and much more

00:15:10.280 --> 00:15:12.339
fun, is who makes
the best hummus?

00:15:12.339 --> 00:15:13.130
INTERVIEWER: Right.

00:15:13.130 --> 00:15:14.174
Or how do you like it?

00:15:14.174 --> 00:15:15.840
YOTAM OTTOLENGHI: Or
how do you like it,

00:15:15.840 --> 00:15:18.410
and then that becomes
a matter of a tribe.

00:15:18.410 --> 00:15:19.910
You know, I go to
this restaurant,

00:15:19.910 --> 00:15:21.460
and I've been going
there all those years,

00:15:21.460 --> 00:15:23.168
and he's been making
it in a certain way,

00:15:23.168 --> 00:15:26.881
and you're stupid to think
that anyone else could make it

00:15:26.881 --> 00:15:27.380
any better.

00:15:27.380 --> 00:15:29.580
And then you've
got a lot of these,

00:15:29.580 --> 00:15:35.070
I call it skirmishes, little
wars, where two shops or two

00:15:35.070 --> 00:15:37.812
restaurants fight on who
makes the best hummus and why.

00:15:37.812 --> 00:15:39.770
Again, like you said,
it's a matter of texture,

00:15:39.770 --> 00:15:42.090
it's a matter of balance,
it's a matter of this.

00:15:42.090 --> 00:15:46.340
And grown-up men can have
serious arguments about hummus.

00:15:46.340 --> 00:15:50.470
Normally it's men because
women are more sensible.

00:15:50.470 --> 00:15:52.320
Have terrible
arguments about where

00:15:52.320 --> 00:15:55.100
is the best place
to have hummus,

00:15:55.100 --> 00:15:58.212
and lose friendships
over subjects.

00:15:58.212 --> 00:15:59.670
INTERVIEWER: So
what's your answer?

00:15:59.670 --> 00:16:01.330
Where is the best place?

00:16:01.330 --> 00:16:02.788
YOTAM OTTOLENGHI:
I'm going to have

00:16:02.788 --> 00:16:04.804
to sit on the fence on this one.

00:16:04.804 --> 00:16:06.220
I mean, there's a
couple of places

00:16:06.220 --> 00:16:09.572
in the Old City of Jerusalem
that have been making hummus

00:16:09.572 --> 00:16:11.780
in a very traditional way
for many, many generations.

00:16:14.410 --> 00:16:16.634
Abu Shukri is one of them.

00:16:16.634 --> 00:16:18.800
It's in the Old City, in
the Arab part of Jerusalem,

00:16:18.800 --> 00:16:20.120
that makes a good one.

00:16:20.120 --> 00:16:20.980
Lina is another one.

00:16:20.980 --> 00:16:26.010
They all follow the same
Jerusalem, Palestinian

00:16:26.010 --> 00:16:30.380
tradition of hummus, which
is warm-ish, very, very

00:16:30.380 --> 00:16:33.200
smooth, and quite
acidic with lemon juice,

00:16:33.200 --> 00:16:35.700
or citric acid if
they're cheating.

00:16:35.700 --> 00:16:38.930
That's a very particular hummus.

00:16:38.930 --> 00:16:40.360
It's a meal.

00:16:40.360 --> 00:16:42.220
Most people don't know
that hummus is not

00:16:42.220 --> 00:16:43.428
something you eat from a tub.

00:16:43.428 --> 00:16:46.960
It's something you eat warm
for your breakfast or lunch

00:16:46.960 --> 00:16:47.640
with a pita.

00:16:47.640 --> 00:16:50.420
And it's cooked to serve
and then thrown away.

00:16:50.420 --> 00:16:51.300
It's not a condiment.

00:16:51.300 --> 00:16:52.050
It's not coleslaw.

00:16:53.829 --> 00:16:55.120
INTERVIEWER: It's not coleslaw.

00:16:58.730 --> 00:17:01.030
Maybe tell me a little
bit, just from reading

00:17:01.030 --> 00:17:02.500
the introduction the book.

00:17:02.500 --> 00:17:05.210
Your first cookbook, or when
you were doing the "Guardian"

00:17:05.210 --> 00:17:07.569
column, you were doing all these
recipes in your kitchen, right?

00:17:07.569 --> 00:17:08.860
YOTAM OTTOLENGHI: Yes, at home.

00:17:08.860 --> 00:17:11.450
INTERVIEWER: And now, you've
been doing this so long

00:17:11.450 --> 00:17:15.030
that you actually have an R&amp;D
studio, a test kitchen, a test

00:17:15.030 --> 00:17:15.730
lab.

00:17:15.730 --> 00:17:17.279
YOTAM OTTOLENGHI: I've
turned into a mini empire,

00:17:17.279 --> 00:17:18.260
a bit like Google.

00:17:21.800 --> 00:17:22.300
Yes.

00:17:22.300 --> 00:17:25.710
I used to test every
single recipe myself.

00:17:25.710 --> 00:17:27.990
Which is kind of fun, but
also a lot of hard work

00:17:27.990 --> 00:17:30.990
because I used to go and
shop, and come back and test

00:17:30.990 --> 00:17:33.470
the recipe, and clean
up and do the washing,

00:17:33.470 --> 00:17:35.130
and then sit and write it.

00:17:35.130 --> 00:17:37.150
I could do two recipes a day.

00:17:37.150 --> 00:17:39.150
And then with the
years, I started

00:17:39.150 --> 00:17:44.510
to have to write more recipes
and publish more books.

00:17:44.510 --> 00:17:47.690
So eventually, I took on
a little industrial space

00:17:47.690 --> 00:17:50.660
under a railway arch
in central London,

00:17:50.660 --> 00:17:53.080
where I have my test
kitchen, and that's

00:17:53.080 --> 00:17:54.960
where things are happening.

00:17:54.960 --> 00:17:57.000
I figure that it's
actually a much better way

00:17:57.000 --> 00:18:00.447
to create recipes
to work in a team.

00:18:00.447 --> 00:18:02.030
The whole of "Plenty"
I did on my own.

00:18:02.030 --> 00:18:04.880
The whole of "Plenty
More" was done in a team.

00:18:04.880 --> 00:18:13.680
I think you get a much
more diverse understanding

00:18:13.680 --> 00:18:15.440
of the food and
a better picture.

00:18:15.440 --> 00:18:18.190
And sometimes the
discussions or the arguments

00:18:18.190 --> 00:18:23.640
about a certain dish lead
into something much better.

00:18:23.640 --> 00:18:28.650
Now I'm much more of a
collaborator than I ever was.

00:18:28.650 --> 00:18:31.522
INTERVIEWER: Do you prefer
being more of a cookbook author

00:18:31.522 --> 00:18:33.480
than actually being in
the kitchen on the line?

00:18:33.480 --> 00:18:34.396
YOTAM OTTOLENGHI: Yes.

00:18:34.396 --> 00:18:37.090
Nowadays, I find
it very relaxing.

00:18:37.090 --> 00:18:38.729
I just sit there
and write my ideas

00:18:38.729 --> 00:18:40.270
and someone does
all the chopping up,

00:18:40.270 --> 00:18:42.269
and then I just need to
come at the right moment

00:18:42.269 --> 00:18:43.580
and put it all together.

00:18:43.580 --> 00:18:45.320
It's much easier.

00:18:45.320 --> 00:18:51.430
But just being a bit
more serious about this,

00:18:51.430 --> 00:18:57.060
the joy of actually cooking,
the activity of cooking

00:18:57.060 --> 00:19:01.100
is very different from the
activity of making recipes.

00:19:01.100 --> 00:19:06.240
When you cook, it's a
visceral, hands-on activity

00:19:06.240 --> 00:19:09.070
where you judge things all
the time with your hands,

00:19:09.070 --> 00:19:12.160
with your eyes, with your mouth.

00:19:12.160 --> 00:19:13.970
When you think up
recipes, it's almost

00:19:13.970 --> 00:19:15.730
like an intellectual exercise.

00:19:15.730 --> 00:19:18.206
You constantly think.

00:19:18.206 --> 00:19:19.830
Sometimes when these
two come together,

00:19:19.830 --> 00:19:22.510
they don't do that very well.

00:19:22.510 --> 00:19:23.870
They're not best friends.

00:19:23.870 --> 00:19:26.150
What seems like a
great idea on paper

00:19:26.150 --> 00:19:27.600
just doesn't work in reality.

00:19:27.600 --> 00:19:31.140
It's quite important for
me to be on both fronts.

00:19:31.140 --> 00:19:32.780
It's not like
architecture, where

00:19:32.780 --> 00:19:38.620
you can design a building
that the engineers break

00:19:38.620 --> 00:19:40.610
their heads over it.

00:19:40.610 --> 00:19:43.010
I need to be there to make
sure that the idea actually

00:19:43.010 --> 00:19:44.540
works and comes together.

00:19:44.540 --> 00:19:47.250
INTERVIEWER: Now, is that
what led you from-- you

00:19:47.250 --> 00:19:51.400
were on a path to academia,
towards getting a PhD.

00:19:51.400 --> 00:19:54.719
Did you go into the
kitchen because you

00:19:54.719 --> 00:19:56.010
wanted to work with your hands?

00:19:56.010 --> 00:19:56.722
Was that it?

00:19:56.722 --> 00:19:57.680
YOTAM OTTOLENGHI: Yeah.

00:19:57.680 --> 00:19:59.221
First of all, when
I started to cook,

00:19:59.221 --> 00:20:02.720
I felt a sense of liberation,
because I actually

00:20:02.720 --> 00:20:07.820
realized that I turned into a
mini slave to my academic life.

00:20:07.820 --> 00:20:11.820
I used to come
home and fret over

00:20:11.820 --> 00:20:14.609
what I haven't done that day--
haven't read this article,

00:20:14.609 --> 00:20:16.150
haven't done this,
haven't done that.

00:20:16.150 --> 00:20:18.430
With food, once you're
done, you're done.

00:20:18.430 --> 00:20:21.670
Once you've cooked or fed a
group of people or your family

00:20:21.670 --> 00:20:25.040
or whatever, it's finished.

00:20:25.040 --> 00:20:29.390
It's a very nice feeling
to have that you've

00:20:29.390 --> 00:20:31.540
finished your
chores for the day.

00:20:31.540 --> 00:20:34.670
I don't know if you know it,
but the feeling that it's

00:20:34.670 --> 00:20:36.430
all done and dusted,
that's it, I'm

00:20:36.430 --> 00:20:38.830
going home, which is
what happens after you've

00:20:38.830 --> 00:20:40.830
done service in a restaurant.

00:20:40.830 --> 00:20:42.670
Even though you work
really hard physically,

00:20:42.670 --> 00:20:44.850
it's actually a great feeling.

00:20:44.850 --> 00:20:49.260
Then you can just not think,
which is a nice thing.

00:20:51.510 --> 00:20:53.760
INTERVIEWER: I saw this tweet
that you wrote recently,

00:20:53.760 --> 00:20:55.573
and I thought it was very funny.

00:20:55.573 --> 00:20:57.050
I'll read it out loud.

00:20:57.050 --> 00:21:00.380
It said, "Tofurky vegan
gluten-free pizza makes

00:21:00.380 --> 00:21:02.195
me sad."

00:21:02.195 --> 00:21:04.564
Can you tell me what
was the context there?

00:21:04.564 --> 00:21:06.730
YOTAM OTTOLENGHI: Well,
someone tweeted that picture

00:21:06.730 --> 00:21:10.930
of some monstrosity
of a supermarket pizza

00:21:10.930 --> 00:21:20.200
that was made out of tofu to
taste like turkey and be vegan.

00:21:20.200 --> 00:21:25.360
So essentially, it was so many
wrong things put in one box.

00:21:25.360 --> 00:21:29.070
First of all, a pizza
that is not a pizza,

00:21:29.070 --> 00:21:34.910
meat that is not meat, and
tofu made to replace dough.

00:21:34.910 --> 00:21:37.600
For me, I'm not a purist.

00:21:37.600 --> 00:21:39.330
As you probably
know, I play around

00:21:39.330 --> 00:21:42.542
with ideas and with recipes,
and I mix a little bit of this

00:21:42.542 --> 00:21:44.000
and a little bit
of that, but there

00:21:44.000 --> 00:21:46.210
are some things that
are just not done.

00:21:46.210 --> 00:21:48.890
And one of them
is try to imitate

00:21:48.890 --> 00:21:50.160
one food with the other.

00:21:50.160 --> 00:21:52.540
I can't stand veggie burgers.

00:21:52.540 --> 00:21:56.410
When you take beans and make
them look as much as possible

00:21:56.410 --> 00:22:00.750
as a piece of hamburger or
meat, and I ask myself, why?

00:22:00.750 --> 00:22:02.750
Because vegetables
are so fantastic,

00:22:02.750 --> 00:22:05.530
why would you want to
turn them into a burger?

00:22:05.530 --> 00:22:07.049
I mean, beans are so great.

00:22:07.049 --> 00:22:08.840
You take beans and you
put some lemon juice

00:22:08.840 --> 00:22:11.420
and garlic and chopped
parsley, maybe cilantro,

00:22:11.420 --> 00:22:13.300
and that's the most
delicious thing.

00:22:13.300 --> 00:22:15.130
And then you put them
in the food processor

00:22:15.130 --> 00:22:17.254
with all sorts of things
that make them look brown,

00:22:17.254 --> 00:22:19.100
and then you fry
them on the outside.

00:22:19.100 --> 00:22:21.930
That's just for me, it's got all
the wrong things in the world.

00:22:21.930 --> 00:22:24.960
I mean, I respect vegetarianism
and I respect veganism

00:22:24.960 --> 00:22:26.810
and I respect lots
of things, but I

00:22:26.810 --> 00:22:30.040
think there's so many
options without trying

00:22:30.040 --> 00:22:36.020
to make one thing taste or
look like something else.

00:22:36.020 --> 00:22:37.155
It doesn't work.

00:22:37.155 --> 00:22:39.280
INTERVIEWER: I think we'll
open it up to questions,

00:22:39.280 --> 00:22:41.030
though my one last
question is, are you

00:22:41.030 --> 00:22:43.180
going to open an
Ottolenghi in New York?

00:22:43.180 --> 00:22:45.680
YOTAM OTTOLENGHI: I've answered
this question so many times,

00:22:45.680 --> 00:22:49.020
but with the word "New York"
could have been another city.

00:22:56.230 --> 00:22:59.270
I'm a terrible
control freak, and I

00:22:59.270 --> 00:23:02.830
find it very
difficult to let go.

00:23:02.830 --> 00:23:06.270
Hence, I cannot work like other
cooks and open restaurants all

00:23:06.270 --> 00:23:08.000
over the world.

00:23:08.000 --> 00:23:11.110
We're a close team of
partners that work like that,

00:23:11.110 --> 00:23:14.050
and we visit our
restaurants all the time.

00:23:14.050 --> 00:23:16.390
It would be very expensive
if I had to come to New York

00:23:16.390 --> 00:23:21.370
every time I wanted to
taste my butternut salad.

00:23:21.370 --> 00:23:22.932
So I'm afraid it's a no.

00:23:22.932 --> 00:23:23.890
INTERVIEWER: It's a no.

00:23:23.890 --> 00:23:24.842
All right.

00:23:24.842 --> 00:23:27.620
We just have some questions.

00:23:27.620 --> 00:23:28.390
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:23:28.390 --> 00:23:29.265
YOTAM OTTOLENGHI: Hi.

00:23:31.090 --> 00:23:32.715
AUDIENCE: Thank you
so much for coming.

00:23:32.715 --> 00:23:35.720
I think your books have always
been an inspiration for me,

00:23:35.720 --> 00:23:38.740
just in terms of
vegetarian cooking.

00:23:38.740 --> 00:23:40.750
I was raised vegetarian,
even though I'm

00:23:40.750 --> 00:23:42.470
no longer a vegetarian.

00:23:42.470 --> 00:23:44.790
My mother is a practicing
Chinese Buddhist.

00:23:44.790 --> 00:23:49.060
And part of the culture is
to not eat any living thing,

00:23:49.060 --> 00:23:51.784
but as well, on
top of that, things

00:23:51.784 --> 00:23:53.200
that are kind of
pungent in nature

00:23:53.200 --> 00:23:55.840
so that when you're in
prayer, you're not supposed

00:23:55.840 --> 00:23:58.910
to have lingering sense of food.

00:23:58.910 --> 00:24:00.880
One challenge that
I have is I have

00:24:00.880 --> 00:24:05.180
to cook for her without any
garlic or anything in the onion

00:24:05.180 --> 00:24:05.710
family.

00:24:05.710 --> 00:24:07.400
So apart from the
things that you've

00:24:07.400 --> 00:24:11.700
mentioned, like cumin and other
spices, what other flavoring

00:24:11.700 --> 00:24:14.000
ingredients do you
think are a top favorite

00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:15.500
that is outside of
those two things?

00:24:20.759 --> 00:24:22.300
YOTAM OTTOLENGHI:
You can really take

00:24:22.300 --> 00:24:25.750
quite a lot of things
out of your cooking,

00:24:25.750 --> 00:24:28.015
because I think there's
so much to substitute.

00:24:32.570 --> 00:24:36.150
One of the ingredients that I
use a lot of in such situations

00:24:36.150 --> 00:24:40.730
is miso, which is a natural
fermentation of soybeans

00:24:40.730 --> 00:24:43.320
or barley or whatever
it is that is

00:24:43.320 --> 00:24:48.160
being used in that
particular miso.

00:24:48.160 --> 00:24:51.130
It adds a lot of flavor.

00:24:51.130 --> 00:24:53.170
And it comes in all
sorts of varieties

00:24:53.170 --> 00:24:55.100
with different
types of intensity,

00:24:55.100 --> 00:24:56.262
and I think it adds a lot.

00:24:56.262 --> 00:24:58.720
I mean, it's never going to
turn into an onion or a garlic.

00:24:58.720 --> 00:25:00.803
And you should never try
to turn it into an onion,

00:25:00.803 --> 00:25:02.020
hence what I said earlier.

00:25:02.020 --> 00:25:04.030
I don't think you
should try this.

00:25:04.030 --> 00:25:06.085
But it has a lot of flavor.

00:25:10.030 --> 00:25:12.660
I think the idea of not
having onion or garlic

00:25:12.660 --> 00:25:15.440
is that it doesn't
linger, so in a sense,

00:25:15.440 --> 00:25:17.140
maybe in those
situations, you do

00:25:17.140 --> 00:25:20.002
want to make something that
is slightly more bland.

00:25:20.002 --> 00:25:22.460
Otherwise, it's kind of cheating
your religion a little bit

00:25:22.460 --> 00:25:25.230
if you're going to do something
that is not onion or garlic

00:25:25.230 --> 00:25:26.560
but is similar.

00:25:26.560 --> 00:25:30.750
I think there's so many things
out there that I would just

00:25:30.750 --> 00:25:34.880
choose something that works
without those ingredients.

00:25:34.880 --> 00:25:36.287
It's possible.

00:25:36.287 --> 00:25:38.370
AUDIENCE: I try to push
her envelope a little bit,

00:25:38.370 --> 00:25:41.060
just because there are
vegetarian restaurants

00:25:41.060 --> 00:25:44.430
out there, but it's like,
here is a fake beef stir fry.

00:25:44.430 --> 00:25:45.640
YOTAM OTTOLENGHI: Yeah.

00:25:45.640 --> 00:25:47.880
It's all wrong.

00:25:47.880 --> 00:25:54.880
If you go to an Asian
[INAUDIBLE] center market where

00:25:54.880 --> 00:25:58.690
all this wonderful stuff,
or Middle Eastern mezze,

00:25:58.690 --> 00:26:02.560
you can pick a dozen things
that are vegan or vegetarian,

00:26:02.560 --> 00:26:03.940
and they've got tons of flavor.

00:26:03.940 --> 00:26:06.790
And you don't need to think
about meat or yogurt or all

00:26:06.790 --> 00:26:10.150
those things that are
not consumed by some,

00:26:10.150 --> 00:26:12.690
and you never feel
that you miss them.

00:26:12.690 --> 00:26:14.870
Once you've started
putting into your head

00:26:14.870 --> 00:26:17.700
that you have to have something
like something you can't have,

00:26:17.700 --> 00:26:20.530
that's where everything
starts to go wrong in my mind.

00:26:20.530 --> 00:26:21.780
AUDIENCE: That's great advice.

00:26:21.780 --> 00:26:22.962
Thank you.

00:26:22.962 --> 00:26:23.920
INTERVIEWER: Over here.

00:26:23.920 --> 00:26:24.780
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:26:24.780 --> 00:26:26.770
Thanks so much for coming.

00:26:26.770 --> 00:26:30.420
You talked a bit at the
start about, I guess,

00:26:30.420 --> 00:26:33.020
more developed nations,
as you refer to it,

00:26:33.020 --> 00:26:36.880
don't really have to cling onto
the foods from past generations

00:26:36.880 --> 00:26:41.920
and appropriate foods from
whatever sources we want.

00:26:41.920 --> 00:26:44.290
I guess taking
that to an extreme,

00:26:44.290 --> 00:26:47.550
do you see a danger
in maybe what's

00:26:47.550 --> 00:26:49.600
happened with hummus,
like you describe?

00:26:49.600 --> 00:26:51.540
It just becomes
almost commodified,

00:26:51.540 --> 00:26:55.005
and it just becomes very generic
and you can buy it in a store.

00:26:55.005 --> 00:26:58.210
Do you see any risk from taking
these very authentic foods,

00:26:58.210 --> 00:27:00.350
popularizing them
in your cookbooks,

00:27:00.350 --> 00:27:02.662
and are we going to
see McDonald's serving

00:27:02.662 --> 00:27:04.870
pomegranate dipping sauce
for their chicken McNuggets

00:27:04.870 --> 00:27:05.810
and stuff like that?

00:27:05.810 --> 00:27:08.970
YOTAM OTTOLENGHI: It's
the first I hear of that.

00:27:08.970 --> 00:27:10.850
Yes, of course this is the risk.

00:27:10.850 --> 00:27:14.415
The smaller the world becomes,
the more we live in cities,

00:27:14.415 --> 00:27:17.960
the less you're going to find
ancient traditions preserved

00:27:17.960 --> 00:27:20.310
in such a way, and everything
is commodified and turned

00:27:20.310 --> 00:27:23.932
into something that is easy to
produce and easy to consume.

00:27:23.932 --> 00:27:25.890
I don't think there is
much we can do about it,

00:27:25.890 --> 00:27:32.350
but I think you can see the
two opposite trends working

00:27:32.350 --> 00:27:34.000
at the same time.

00:27:34.000 --> 00:27:37.420
While we want to have hummus on
the shelves in our supermarket,

00:27:37.420 --> 00:27:39.950
there's also, at the same
time, a real yearning

00:27:39.950 --> 00:27:43.190
for the proper thing,
the real thing.

00:27:43.190 --> 00:27:45.740
So you'd find a
little joint somewhere

00:27:45.740 --> 00:27:48.550
that people are willing
to queue for hours to get

00:27:48.550 --> 00:27:50.740
the authentic experience.

00:27:50.740 --> 00:27:54.460
I don't think they
necessarily mean

00:27:54.460 --> 00:27:57.492
the extinction of old
ways of doing things.

00:27:57.492 --> 00:27:59.200
I'm sure we're going
to see less of them.

00:27:59.200 --> 00:28:01.980
They're going to become
more of a curiosity.

00:28:01.980 --> 00:28:05.620
There's something about
modernizing, again,

00:28:05.620 --> 00:28:07.590
whatever that means,
that means you're

00:28:07.590 --> 00:28:11.390
going to see a little bit less
of what is being modernized.

00:28:11.390 --> 00:28:13.820
That is a sad fact,
but I don't think

00:28:13.820 --> 00:28:16.150
there's that much we could do.

00:28:16.150 --> 00:28:18.570
The one thing I
would say, again,

00:28:18.570 --> 00:28:20.760
is that one of the
good things that's

00:28:20.760 --> 00:28:23.460
come out of this
intense interest in food

00:28:23.460 --> 00:28:28.140
that we've seen over the last
20 years on television and just

00:28:28.140 --> 00:28:31.030
in people's lives
is that there is,

00:28:31.030 --> 00:28:36.820
I think, a real yearning to
things as they used to be

00:28:36.820 --> 00:28:39.470
and as they should be.

00:28:39.470 --> 00:28:44.170
And hence, people do write
books or open restaurants

00:28:44.170 --> 00:28:49.420
or go on pilgrimage
to proper places,

00:28:49.420 --> 00:28:52.712
and I think that's
still going to stay.

00:28:52.712 --> 00:28:53.420
AUDIENCE: Thanks.

00:28:53.420 --> 00:28:54.622
INTERVIEWER: Over here.

00:28:54.622 --> 00:28:56.330
AUDIENCE: I first
wanted to say that it's

00:28:56.330 --> 00:28:58.310
been really great
having your cookbooks.

00:28:58.310 --> 00:29:01.267
I'm a vegetarian and
my mom loves to cook.

00:29:01.267 --> 00:29:03.100
And it's been a really
big challenge for her

00:29:03.100 --> 00:29:04.475
to figure out what
to make for me

00:29:04.475 --> 00:29:07.460
and my partner over the years
for holidays like Thanksgiving

00:29:07.460 --> 00:29:08.640
and stuff.

00:29:08.640 --> 00:29:11.370
So you've presented her with
a really good challenge and me

00:29:11.370 --> 00:29:14.022
with some really good
food since they came out.

00:29:14.022 --> 00:29:15.980
And I'm also really
excited about the new book.

00:29:15.980 --> 00:29:18.320
I have a lot of
Persian Jewish friends

00:29:18.320 --> 00:29:20.920
and tend to eat a lot of
Sephardic-type cuisine,

00:29:20.920 --> 00:29:24.200
so that will really add to
that experience as well.

00:29:24.200 --> 00:29:26.275
My question is a little
bit silly but fun.

00:29:26.275 --> 00:29:28.650
I'm going with my parents to
your restaurant in Islington

00:29:28.650 --> 00:29:32.490
in December, and is there one
thing, if anything, on the menu

00:29:32.490 --> 00:29:34.750
that you would
recommend that we get,

00:29:34.750 --> 00:29:37.164
since it's a special experience
because of that bonding?

00:29:37.164 --> 00:29:38.580
YOTAM OTTOLENGHI:
The trouble is I

00:29:38.580 --> 00:29:41.270
don't know what's going to
be on the menu in December

00:29:41.270 --> 00:29:44.260
because the menu changes.

00:29:44.260 --> 00:29:45.550
So it will be difficult.

00:29:45.550 --> 00:29:50.860
But I think you're going to
find the menu is quite small.

00:29:50.860 --> 00:29:58.550
It's composed of about 16
dishes, so being vegetarian,

00:29:58.550 --> 00:30:02.740
you're going to have to
concentrate on the vegetables.

00:30:02.740 --> 00:30:07.971
And there's probably 10
vegetarian dishes on the menu,

00:30:07.971 --> 00:30:09.470
and it's sharing,
so you'll probably

00:30:09.470 --> 00:30:11.042
just order all of them.

00:30:11.042 --> 00:30:12.317
AUDIENCE: I'm down for that.

00:30:12.317 --> 00:30:13.349
Thank you.

00:30:13.349 --> 00:30:14.890
INTERVIEWER: When
you're in New York,

00:30:14.890 --> 00:30:16.480
are there things you
come here, that you

00:30:16.480 --> 00:30:17.910
feel like you love that
you get in New York

00:30:17.910 --> 00:30:19.868
that you can't find good
versions of in London?

00:30:19.868 --> 00:30:21.740
Or is London
cosmopolitan enough now

00:30:21.740 --> 00:30:25.690
that you have barbecue
and pizza just like--

00:30:25.690 --> 00:30:29.510
YOTAM OTTOLENGHI: New York
is by no means-- I mean,

00:30:29.510 --> 00:30:33.910
it's got its own sense
of food identity.

00:30:33.910 --> 00:30:38.490
There's no Jewish
delis in London,

00:30:38.490 --> 00:30:41.550
so there are certain things
you can only get here,

00:30:41.550 --> 00:30:45.010
and a few other things.

00:30:45.010 --> 00:30:48.314
No, I can't get
everything I want.

00:30:48.314 --> 00:30:50.220
INTERVIEWER: Another question.

00:30:50.220 --> 00:30:53.370
AUDIENCE: So you were talking
before about ingredients

00:30:53.370 --> 00:30:58.080
that people may not be
familiar with that you

00:30:58.080 --> 00:30:59.630
expose in your cookbooks.

00:30:59.630 --> 00:31:02.440
Personally, I started
cooking with kohlrabi

00:31:02.440 --> 00:31:04.860
a lot more after reading your
cookbooks, which I really

00:31:04.860 --> 00:31:06.210
enjoy.

00:31:06.210 --> 00:31:08.890
But I was wondering,
is there a technique

00:31:08.890 --> 00:31:12.580
that you think is really
underused by home cooks

00:31:12.580 --> 00:31:14.740
that you think people
should be learning more?

00:31:14.740 --> 00:31:16.448
YOTAM OTTOLENGHI: I'm
really happy you're

00:31:16.448 --> 00:31:21.490
asking this question
because I think

00:31:21.490 --> 00:31:25.730
what makes "Plenty More" special
in relation to the other books

00:31:25.730 --> 00:31:27.130
is the focus on technique.

00:31:32.590 --> 00:31:34.110
The book is divided
into chapters

00:31:34.110 --> 00:31:35.900
according to cooking
method or cooking

00:31:35.900 --> 00:31:39.320
technique-- steamed,
roasted, grilled,

00:31:39.320 --> 00:31:41.450
and so on and so forth.

00:31:41.450 --> 00:31:45.010
The reason why I decided
to do it this time this way

00:31:45.010 --> 00:31:50.040
is because I felt that there
is a lack of understanding

00:31:50.040 --> 00:31:56.230
as to how crucial it is
what you do with vegetables.

00:31:56.230 --> 00:31:59.010
I think that knowledge
is, to most people,

00:31:59.010 --> 00:32:05.080
quite natural when it comes to
meat and when it comes to fish.

00:32:05.080 --> 00:32:07.530
Fish you cook very lightly.

00:32:07.530 --> 00:32:10.630
You grill them and you
don't mess about with them.

00:32:10.630 --> 00:32:13.720
Not many fish are
good for long cooking.

00:32:13.720 --> 00:32:15.880
Meat is slightly different.

00:32:15.880 --> 00:32:20.620
The prime cuts you eat
seared or almost raw,

00:32:20.620 --> 00:32:24.160
and the cheap cuts you
stew, et cetera, et cetera.

00:32:24.160 --> 00:32:25.770
So we have that kind
of understanding.

00:32:25.770 --> 00:32:28.080
And I give an example
in the introduction

00:32:28.080 --> 00:32:31.230
about the fact that if the
steak is not to our liking,

00:32:31.230 --> 00:32:34.230
we send it back because we know
what a steak should be like.

00:32:34.230 --> 00:32:37.430
And I really don't think the
same applies to vegetables.

00:32:37.430 --> 00:32:39.920
I've decided to take the
recipes, which are not

00:32:39.920 --> 00:32:43.160
different in a dramatic
way from "Plenty,"

00:32:43.160 --> 00:32:46.005
but I decided to divide them
according to the main cooking

00:32:46.005 --> 00:32:48.380
technique, because I wanted
to draw attention to the fact

00:32:48.380 --> 00:32:51.170
that it really is crucial what
you do with the vegetable.

00:32:51.170 --> 00:32:58.240
So I'll take as an example
vegetables that are probably

00:32:58.240 --> 00:33:03.280
not a tomato or eggplant,
which are kind of sexy.

00:33:03.280 --> 00:33:06.685
I'll take not so sexy vegetables
like a Brussels sprout

00:33:06.685 --> 00:33:11.220
or a turnip or a cauliflower
and give you an example.

00:33:11.220 --> 00:33:14.120
With a Brussels
sprout, most people

00:33:14.120 --> 00:33:17.270
that I know, up until
recently, just threw it

00:33:17.270 --> 00:33:19.510
into boiling water and
cooked it and maybe

00:33:19.510 --> 00:33:22.730
just added some bacon
later or something.

00:33:22.730 --> 00:33:26.130
This book offers tons of ways
to cook Brussels sprouts not

00:33:26.130 --> 00:33:28.960
to boil them or over-boil
them, as many people

00:33:28.960 --> 00:33:34.650
do-- roasting, grilling,
eating raw in a salad,

00:33:34.650 --> 00:33:40.810
deep frying for risotto,
or serving as a salad.

00:33:40.810 --> 00:33:43.350
Brussels sprouts are
not loved, I think,

00:33:43.350 --> 00:33:45.220
not because they're not good.

00:33:45.220 --> 00:33:48.570
It's just because they're
really badly cooked normally.

00:33:48.570 --> 00:33:50.460
So I try to take
something like that

00:33:50.460 --> 00:33:53.250
and really open it up
completely and have the Brussels

00:33:53.250 --> 00:33:55.845
sprout appear in different
chapters in different guises,

00:33:55.845 --> 00:33:58.310
and get the readers
and the cooks

00:33:58.310 --> 00:34:01.920
to understand how
crucial it is that we

00:34:01.920 --> 00:34:04.430
pay the same amount of
respect to the way we cook

00:34:04.430 --> 00:34:08.329
our vegetables as we do to meat.

00:34:08.329 --> 00:34:10.579
INTERVIEWER: Is there a
vegetable you've tried to like

00:34:10.579 --> 00:34:11.574
but just cannot?

00:34:11.574 --> 00:34:12.449
YOTAM OTTOLENGHI: No.

00:34:15.030 --> 00:34:20.020
I have tried to think of a
vegetable that I don't like,

00:34:20.020 --> 00:34:21.694
and I haven't found one yet.

00:34:26.250 --> 00:34:27.959
With fruit, it's a
bit more difficult

00:34:27.959 --> 00:34:30.000
because there's some
pungent fruits, Asian fruits

00:34:30.000 --> 00:34:32.739
like durian, that
are really stinky.

00:34:32.739 --> 00:34:36.620
It's very difficult to eat
because it challenges you

00:34:36.620 --> 00:34:39.260
on various levels.

00:34:39.260 --> 00:34:40.570
But vegetables, no.

00:34:40.570 --> 00:34:42.730
I haven't come across
one that I really like.

00:34:42.730 --> 00:34:47.949
And kohlrabi that you mentioned
is a wonderful vegetable.

00:34:47.949 --> 00:34:50.530
I've just done a
kohlrabi gratin.

00:34:50.530 --> 00:34:54.940
By the way, it was inspired
by Deborah Madison, who

00:34:54.940 --> 00:35:01.110
is the goddess of
vegetables in my mind.

00:35:01.110 --> 00:35:04.400
You'd think that kohlrabi
has a high water content

00:35:04.400 --> 00:35:07.360
and the gratin is going to be
watery, but in actual fact,

00:35:07.360 --> 00:35:08.110
it's fantastic.

00:35:08.110 --> 00:35:12.050
By the time you cook it with
lots of wonderful cheeses,

00:35:12.050 --> 00:35:17.560
it's completely moist and it's
got that slight bitterness that

00:35:17.560 --> 00:35:20.720
counteracts the
richness of the cheese,

00:35:20.720 --> 00:35:22.290
and it's one of the
wonderful things

00:35:22.290 --> 00:35:23.427
that everyone should cook.

00:35:23.427 --> 00:35:25.260
INTERVIEWER: I want to
leave time for people

00:35:25.260 --> 00:35:27.740
to get books signed, so I think
this is probably a good time

00:35:27.740 --> 00:35:28.140
to break.

00:35:28.140 --> 00:35:29.223
Thanks so much for coming.

00:35:29.223 --> 00:35:30.240
Really appreciate it.

00:35:30.240 --> 00:35:35.090
[APPLAUSE]
