00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000
Okay, so the correct answers are not because posts can't return HTML.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000
We've seen that posts can return HTML.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
They can return our error page, for example.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:15.000
Reloading our success page doesn't resubmit the form.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.000
That's a nice benefit to remove the form parameters from URL.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.000
Technically, if you had a get request that submitted your form,

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.000
and then you redirected when a form was valid,

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
yes you can remove the form parameters from the URL.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:32.000
However, if you're sending data to the server with the get request

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.000
you have not been paying attention to this lesson.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.000
So I'm not going to count this as correct.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.000
Finally, so we can have distinct pages for forms and success pages.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.000
This is also true.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.000
What I've been getting at is this nice behavior you can have

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:50.000
where you have your forms, and you submit that form over and over, you post to it,

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.000
and you keep getting that form over and over until it's valid.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:58.000
Once it's valid we bounce the user, we redirect the user to another page,

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.000
whether it's a permalink to the blog post they just entered

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:04.000
or a thank you for being so good at entering dates page,

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.000
to a thanks for registering on our website page.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:13.000
There's lots of things you want to do there, but having separate pages for those is nice.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:14.000
It's a nice way to structure app.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:18.000
So let's go ahead and make this change to the app we've been working on.
