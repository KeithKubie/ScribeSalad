00:00:00.660 --> 00:00:03.410
Let's graph another rational
function, because you really

00:00:03.410 --> 00:00:05.270
can't get enough
practice here.

00:00:05.270 --> 00:00:12.690
So let's say we have y is equal
to x over x squared

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:16.510
minus x minus 6.

00:00:16.510 --> 00:00:19.000
So the first thing we might want
to do is just factor this

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.680
denominator so we can identify
our vertical asymptotes, if

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:23.880
there are any.

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:26.190
So what two numbers when I
take their product I get

00:00:26.190 --> 00:00:29.880
negative 6 and if I add them
up I get negative 1?

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:31.810
So they have to be of
different signs.

00:00:31.810 --> 00:00:35.510
So one's going to be a plus and
one-- let me write my x's

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:38.940
a little bit neater than that--
so one is going to be a

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:42.470
positive and one is going
to be a negative.

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:45.240
A 2 and a 3 seem to be pretty
close, because they're one

00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:47.890
apart, and I'm going to subtract
the larger number

00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:49.830
because when I add them,
I get a negative.

00:00:49.830 --> 00:00:53.780
So x minus 3 times x plus
2 seems to work.

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:55.250
That gets negative 6.

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:57.150
Negative 3x plus 2x.

00:00:57.150 --> 00:00:59.830
negative 3 times x
plus 2 times x is

00:00:59.830 --> 00:01:01.970
negative x, so that works.

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:10.140
So this is equal to x over
x plus 2 times x minus 3.

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:12.930
And like we saw in the last
video, since these

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:15.590
expressions, since the x plus
2 doesn't cancel out with

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:19.290
anything in the numerator and
the x minus 3 doesn't cancel

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:22.820
out with anything in the
numerator, we know that these

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:25.100
can be used to find our
vertical asymptotes.

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:27.940
The vertical asymptotes are when
either that term is equal

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:31.070
to zero or when that term is
equal to zero, because at

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:33.670
those points, our equation
is undefined.

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:37.640
So this is equal to zero when x
is equal to negative 2, and

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:41.900
this is equal to zero when
x is equal to positive 3.

00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:43.060
And you could try it out here.

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:45.890
If x is equal to negative 2 or
positive 3, you're going to

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:46.490
get a zero in the

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:49.310
denonminator, y will be undefined.

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:52.940
So vertical asymptotes at x
is equal to negative 2.

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:56.930
So there's a vertical asymptote,
a vertical

00:01:56.930 --> 00:01:59.650
asymptote right there.

00:01:59.650 --> 00:02:01.940
Another vertical asymptote
is x is equal to 3.

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:04.050
One, two, three.

00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:09.410
There is our other vertical
asymptote.

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:11.840
Now let's think about horizontal
asymptotes, or if

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:13.650
there are any.

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:17.470
So what happens as x gets
super-positive or

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:18.290
super-negative?

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:20.090
And as we said before, you
just have to look at the

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:23.560
highest degree term on the
numerator and the highest

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:26.350
degree term on the
denominator.

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:29.990
Now, notice the highest degree
term on the denominator is x

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:32.400
squared, while the highest
degree term on the numerator

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:33.870
is only an x.

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:36.680
So when x gets really large,
what's going to happen?

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:38.850
You could imagine, this is going
to be like a million

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:44.260
over a million squared, which
is still one over a million.

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:46.470
These terms over here
don't matter much.

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:48.850
But this term right here is
going to grow faster than

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:50.350
everything.

00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:52.060
This is an x squared term.

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:54.480
As x gets large, it's going
to get way larger than

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:57.550
everything, including this
term on the top, so it's

00:02:57.550 --> 00:02:59.230
essentially going
to go to zero.

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:02.080
When the denominator just gets
bigger, faster than the

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:05.340
numerator as you're going
to approach zero.

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:08.745
So we have a horizontal
asymptote at y is equal to 0.

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:16.490
I could draw it as a dotted
line over our x-axis.

00:03:16.490 --> 00:03:22.530
So that right there is the
line, y is equal to 0.

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:25.760
Once again, we identify that
looking at the highest degree

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:26.630
term there.

00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:29.700
The denominator has a
higher-degree term, so it's

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:31.590
going to grow faster
than the numerator.

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:33.250
You could try it out
on your calculator.

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:35.450
And that's true whether you
go in the super-negative

00:03:35.450 --> 00:03:37.120
direction or the super-positive
direction.

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:41.030
This thing is going to overwhelm
this thing up here,

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:44.240
the denominator grows faster
than the numerator, which

00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:45.540
essentially we're going
to approach zero.

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:48.310
You're going to get smaller
and smaller fractions.

00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:55.000
Just remember, 1/10 and then--
let me actually just-- as x

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:56.700
gets larger and larger
and larger,

00:03:56.700 --> 00:03:57.430
what's going to happen?

00:03:57.430 --> 00:04:01.730
Let me just show you
on my calculator.

00:04:01.730 --> 00:04:03.920
Let's say x is equal to 10.

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:11.570
10 divided by 10 squared minus
10, and normally you wouldn't

00:04:11.570 --> 00:04:12.090
have to do this.

00:04:12.090 --> 00:04:15.010
I just really want to show
you the intuition.

00:04:15.010 --> 00:04:15.800
Whoops!

00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:17.050
I'm not trying to graph.

00:04:21.220 --> 00:04:24.460
Let me exit from here.

00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:30.400
So if we have 10 over 10 squared
minus 10, once again,

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:31.800
you normally wouldn't
have to do this.

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:34.430
I just want to show you,
give you the intuition.

00:04:34.430 --> 00:04:36.670
Let me put some parentheses
there.

00:04:36.670 --> 00:04:39.270
Let me put some parentheses
over here.

00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:43.360
So let me insert the parentheses
there and put a

00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:45.840
parentheses over here.

00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:47.830
You get a small number.

00:04:47.830 --> 00:04:49.380
What happens if x gets
even larger?

00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:57.110
Let me make, instead of a 10,
let me make it all 100.

00:04:57.110 --> 00:05:03.040
Let me make these tens into
hundreds, into 100.

00:05:03.040 --> 00:05:04.850
Insert 100 there,
what do we get?

00:05:04.850 --> 00:05:06.470
We get even a smaller number.

00:05:06.470 --> 00:05:08.090
And if you try x is equal to
1,000, it's going to be be

00:05:08.090 --> 00:05:09.100
even smaller than that.

00:05:09.100 --> 00:05:11.510
That's because this term right
here is growing faster than

00:05:11.510 --> 00:05:13.620
every single other term.

00:05:13.620 --> 00:05:17.210
That's why our horizontal
asymptote is y is equal to 0.

00:05:17.210 --> 00:05:19.610
Now, the last thing we want to
do, we've drawn all of our

00:05:19.610 --> 00:05:21.930
asymptotes, is just try
out some points.

00:05:21.930 --> 00:05:26.130
So let's draw like a
little table here.

00:05:26.130 --> 00:05:27.650
There's our table.

00:05:27.650 --> 00:05:30.570
When x is equal to
0, what is y?

00:05:30.570 --> 00:05:32.950
x is 0, we have 0 over
all of this.

00:05:32.950 --> 00:05:37.200
0 minus 6, 0 over negative
6 is just 0.

00:05:37.200 --> 00:05:39.990
When x is equal to-- I don't
know, let's just try when x is

00:05:39.990 --> 00:05:42.900
equal to 1, what do we have?

00:05:42.900 --> 00:05:44.980
We have 1 over-- I'll
write it here.

00:05:44.980 --> 00:05:48.650
1 over 1 squared minus 1.

00:05:48.650 --> 00:05:52.410
Now that's just 0, so
we have negative 6.

00:05:52.410 --> 00:05:54.910
When x is equal to negative
1, what do we have?

00:05:54.910 --> 00:06:02.790
When x is equal to negative
1, we have negative 1 over

00:06:02.790 --> 00:06:08.310
negative 1 squared, which
is 1 minus negative 1.

00:06:08.310 --> 00:06:14.350
So that's plus 1-- right, minus
negative 1-- minus 6.

00:06:14.350 --> 00:06:16.630
So what is this right here?

00:06:16.630 --> 00:06:22.460
This is negative 1, so this is
going to be negative 1 over 2

00:06:22.460 --> 00:06:24.400
minus 6 over negative 4.

00:06:24.400 --> 00:06:28.410
This is going to be equal to
1/4, so we're going to get a

00:06:28.410 --> 00:06:29.990
positive value.

00:06:29.990 --> 00:06:32.870
So we have-- let me draw this--
negative 1, we're at

00:06:32.870 --> 00:06:35.130
1/4 right here.

00:06:35.130 --> 00:06:36.170
That's about right there.

00:06:36.170 --> 00:06:38.490
I'll do it in a darker color.

00:06:38.490 --> 00:06:43.630
We had the point 0, 0, and then
at x is equal to 1, we

00:06:43.630 --> 00:06:45.600
had negative 1/6.

00:06:45.600 --> 00:06:51.240
So you could keep graphing more
and more points, but it

00:06:51.240 --> 00:06:54.150
looks like as we approach this
vertical asymptote from the

00:06:54.150 --> 00:06:57.210
right, we go to positive
infinity.

00:07:00.100 --> 00:07:02.060
And that should make sense.

00:07:02.060 --> 00:07:04.810
Let's see, if we were to put
in-- we're approaching

00:07:04.810 --> 00:07:06.310
negative 2 from the right.

00:07:06.310 --> 00:07:12.350
So if you were to put in
negative 1.9999999, this term

00:07:12.350 --> 00:07:14.700
is going to be a very small
positive number.

00:07:14.700 --> 00:07:17.010
This term's going to be
a negative number.

00:07:17.010 --> 00:07:18.640
This term's going to
be negative number.

00:07:18.640 --> 00:07:19.970
The negatives cancel out.

00:07:19.970 --> 00:07:22.870
You have a very small positive
number in the denominator.

00:07:22.870 --> 00:07:26.280
1 over that gives you a
very positive number.

00:07:26.280 --> 00:07:30.390
Now, as we approach the other
vertical asymptote from the

00:07:30.390 --> 00:07:33.830
left, we're going to
go super-negative.

00:07:33.830 --> 00:07:37.375
My gut tells me that because
when I tried x is equal to 1,

00:07:37.375 --> 00:07:39.560
I already went to a
negative value.

00:07:39.560 --> 00:07:44.530
But you could imagine if
you did 2.99999, right?

00:07:44.530 --> 00:07:45.920
Let me draw that a little
bit better.

00:07:48.580 --> 00:07:49.590
You get the idea.

00:07:49.590 --> 00:07:52.520
If x is equal to 2.999, so we
get really close to the

00:07:52.520 --> 00:07:55.970
asymptote, this is going to be
positive, this is going to be

00:07:55.970 --> 00:07:59.250
negative, that's going to be
positive, and this is going to

00:07:59.250 --> 00:08:00.510
be a small number.

00:08:00.510 --> 00:08:05.210
So you're going to have 1 over
a very small negative number,

00:08:05.210 --> 00:08:09.120
which is a very, I guess,
negative number.

00:08:09.120 --> 00:08:11.520
It's a negative of 1 over a very
small number, so you're

00:08:11.520 --> 00:08:13.370
going to approach negative
infinity.

00:08:13.370 --> 00:08:16.810
Now, let's try some point out
here to see what happens.

00:08:16.810 --> 00:08:21.630
So what happens when
x is equal to 4?

00:08:21.630 --> 00:08:31.910
When x is equal to 4, you have
4 over 16 minus 4 minus 6.

00:08:31.910 --> 00:08:32.490
What is that?

00:08:32.490 --> 00:08:34.360
That's 16 minus 10.

00:08:34.360 --> 00:08:35.034
That is 6.

00:08:35.034 --> 00:08:42.419
So this is equal to 4/6,
which is equal to 2/3.

00:08:42.419 --> 00:08:46.390
So the point 4, 2/3 is here,
so one, two, three, four.

00:08:46.390 --> 00:08:48.510
2/3, just like that.

00:08:48.510 --> 00:08:50.870
So that gives me the sense,
look, I have to approach this

00:08:50.870 --> 00:08:53.680
horizontal asymptote as we go
further and further out.

00:08:53.680 --> 00:08:56.330
We're going to probably
approach positive

00:08:56.330 --> 00:09:00.130
infinity like this.

00:09:00.130 --> 00:09:02.250
Let me draw it a little
neater than that.

00:09:02.250 --> 00:09:04.250
Like that.

00:09:04.250 --> 00:09:05.730
You get the idea.

00:09:05.730 --> 00:09:10.540
Then over here, we're going to
get closer and closer to our

00:09:10.540 --> 00:09:13.530
horizontal asymptote as
we approach infinity.

00:09:13.530 --> 00:09:15.530
This should be a
smoother-looking curve right

00:09:15.530 --> 00:09:16.620
around there.

00:09:16.620 --> 00:09:18.230
I'm making a mess here.

00:09:18.230 --> 00:09:20.170
This should be a
smoother-looking curve.

00:09:20.170 --> 00:09:22.550
You get the idea, I think.

00:09:22.550 --> 00:09:25.150
Now, let's see what happens when
x is equal to negative 3.

00:09:28.440 --> 00:09:34.200
So when x is equal to negative
3, we have negative 3 over

00:09:34.200 --> 00:09:38.860
negative 3 squared, which is 9
minus negative 3, so that's

00:09:38.860 --> 00:09:42.290
plus 3 minus 6.

00:09:42.290 --> 00:09:43.770
So what is this equal to?

00:09:43.770 --> 00:09:49.380
This is equal to negative 3
over-- this is 12 minus 6 over

00:09:49.380 --> 00:09:55.630
6, right, which is equal to
negative 1/2, So negative 3,

00:09:55.630 --> 00:09:57.700
negative 1/2.

00:09:57.700 --> 00:09:59.120
Negative 1/2 is right there.

00:09:59.120 --> 00:10:01.670
So we're going to approach
this asymptote as we get

00:10:01.670 --> 00:10:03.570
really negative.

00:10:03.570 --> 00:10:07.340
And we're probably going to go
straight down like that as we

00:10:07.340 --> 00:10:10.180
approach this vertical asymptote
right there.

00:10:10.180 --> 00:10:13.270
And you could try more points
if you don't believe me.

00:10:13.270 --> 00:10:19.350
But let us graph it just to
verify it for ourselves.

00:10:19.350 --> 00:10:36.220
So our equation is x divided by
x squared minus x minus 6.

00:10:36.220 --> 00:10:39.420
And let's graph it.

00:10:39.420 --> 00:10:40.730
And there you go.

00:10:40.730 --> 00:10:41.670
There you go.

00:10:41.670 --> 00:10:43.240
All right, looks pretty good.

00:10:46.220 --> 00:10:48.390
Our asymptote is zero,
we go down.

00:10:48.390 --> 00:10:49.850
Vertical asymptote, bam!

00:10:49.850 --> 00:10:52.740
Go up there, then we go back
down here, then we go just

00:10:52.740 --> 00:10:53.920
like that again.

00:10:53.920 --> 00:10:58.550
So once again, this looks just
about exactly what we got.

00:10:58.550 --> 00:11:01.250
Obviously, the graphing
calculator, it kind of a

00:11:01.250 --> 00:11:04.020
pitters out as you get close
to these values and it does

00:11:04.020 --> 00:11:06.600
weird things, but it has
the same general shape.

00:11:06.600 --> 00:11:10.010
We could actually close the
range a little bit if we want,

00:11:10.010 --> 00:11:11.190
if we want to graph it.

00:11:11.190 --> 00:11:15.600
Let's make our x minimum
value, let's make it 5.

00:11:15.600 --> 00:11:17.550
And let's take our x maximum
value, let's

00:11:17.550 --> 00:11:18.990
make that 5 as well.

00:11:18.990 --> 00:11:20.970
We're kind of zooming
in a little bit.

00:11:20.970 --> 00:11:22.520
So let's graph it now.

00:11:22.520 --> 00:11:23.930
Bam!

00:11:23.930 --> 00:11:24.900
bam!

00:11:24.900 --> 00:11:25.590
There you go!

00:11:25.590 --> 00:11:27.750
It's the same shape as we
graphed right here.

00:11:27.750 --> 00:11:30.010
Hopefully, you found
that satisfying.
