00:00:00,720 --> 00:00:05,720
You are listening to radio
lab radio from W N Y Weiss,

2
00:00:05,970 --> 00:00:09,840
c e n n p. R.

3
00:00:14,990 --> 00:00:15,080
[inaudible].

4
00:00:15,080 --> 00:00:17,570
Hey, I'm jabbing rod
and I'm Robert Krulwich.

5
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:22,550
This is radio lab in the couple of
days ago as in like seven we uh,

6
00:00:22,610 --> 00:00:25,970
we were on stage at the Brooklyn Academy
of Music, the big opera house there.

7
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,660
It's a really beautiful theater and
it was full of more than 2000 people.

8
00:00:29,661 --> 00:00:32,150
We were part of something
called Radio Love Fest.

9
00:00:32,760 --> 00:00:33,593
Brilliant

10
00:00:36,110 --> 00:00:36,430
radio.

11
00:00:36,430 --> 00:00:41,430
OFS is a big public radio broadcasting
radio lovey thing that w NYC station here

12
00:00:43,061 --> 00:00:43,661
puts on.

13
00:00:43,661 --> 00:00:47,770
Basically it's a parade of all these
amazing public radio shows and podcasts.

14
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:51,100
We opened the festival and since
it was called radio love fest,

15
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:56,500
we figured we would use the opportunity
to basically talk about the community of

16
00:00:56,501 --> 00:01:00,550
people around radio lab that we
love, the producers, the musicians,

17
00:01:00,551 --> 00:01:04,210
we features amazing acts like so
percussion who you're hearing.

18
00:01:05,050 --> 00:01:07,480
A lot of stuff happened and we
told a lot of stories today.

19
00:01:07,481 --> 00:01:08,770
We're just on this podcast.
We're gonna [inaudible]

20
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:13,500
play two stories for you. These are
both stories about love and about heart.

21
00:01:14,230 --> 00:01:16,380
The last one, which you'll hear is a,

22
00:01:16,381 --> 00:01:18,570
is an exclusive interview
with Oliver Sacks.

23
00:01:19,410 --> 00:01:23,640
Basically giving a kind of valedictory
interview. It's pretty wonderful.

24
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:28,620
But first we decided to do
literally a look at a heart.

25
00:01:28,740 --> 00:01:32,610
This comes from our producer Molly
Webster. It was scored live by a,

26
00:01:33,420 --> 00:01:36,190
so percussion, which is Eric
Chubb Beach, Josh Quillin,

27
00:01:36,850 --> 00:01:38,010
Jason Trudy and Adams Lewinsky. Oh.

28
00:01:38,011 --> 00:01:40,980
And some people in the audience in the
theater audience had a pretty strong

29
00:01:40,981 --> 00:01:42,540
reaction to what you were about to hear.

30
00:01:43,170 --> 00:01:47,160
And we're not so sure that that might
not also be the case if you're just

31
00:01:47,161 --> 00:01:50,550
listening. So if you are driving
or you're operating machinery,

32
00:01:50,551 --> 00:01:53,280
maybe this isn't the best piece to
listen to because it can get a little

33
00:01:53,340 --> 00:01:56,720
intense, which we'll talk about a little
bit afterwards. Uh, in the meantime,

34
00:01:56,750 --> 00:01:58,370
here's producer Molly Webster.

35
00:01:59,050 --> 00:02:02,030
So this is a story about
a friend, summer ash. Uh,

36
00:02:02,050 --> 00:02:06,370
we used to work together and I think
it's fair to say that summer has a

37
00:02:06,371 --> 00:02:10,630
complicated relationship with her heart.
You know, my heart was not beating

38
00:02:12,940 --> 00:02:17,320
for three hours is a really crazy thought.

39
00:02:18,470 --> 00:02:21,640
Yeah, I was technically,

40
00:02:23,770 --> 00:02:28,130
I don't know. So a couple of
things to know about summer.

41
00:02:28,131 --> 00:02:32,030
She's like wicked smart.
She's an astrophysicist.
She uses a lot of big words,

42
00:02:32,031 --> 00:02:36,230
propulsion, center of gravity and
moment of inertia, x and Y, Z axis.

43
00:02:36,260 --> 00:02:38,990
Do you remember that original
like radial keratotomy like no,

44
00:02:38,991 --> 00:02:40,490
I don't even know what that word is.

45
00:02:42,380 --> 00:02:44,870
The other thing to know is
she's an engineer, right?

46
00:02:44,871 --> 00:02:47,360
So she loves like take things apart.

47
00:02:48,380 --> 00:02:52,220
You sort of like coke around rewire,

48
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:55,690
ratchet. You got a ratchet.

49
00:02:56,450 --> 00:02:59,950
And so the thing to know is when she
found out she had to get heart surgery,

50
00:02:59,951 --> 00:03:03,880
she made sure there was someone in the
operating room with a camera taking

51
00:03:03,881 --> 00:03:08,881
pictures of my open chest cavity and the
valve and when things were cut and when

52
00:03:09,791 --> 00:03:12,190
things were being sown in. Yeah,

53
00:03:12,250 --> 00:03:14,650
I totally approached this
completely as a scientist.

54
00:03:14,651 --> 00:03:17,350
I want to know what's
happening. I want to know why.

55
00:03:17,350 --> 00:03:19,510
I want to know what you're doing. I want
to know what's going on around. Yeah.

56
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:23,060
And in any case, to sort
of back up and explain, um,

57
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:28,120
summer was just following up on like a
heart diagnosis that it had happened.

58
00:03:28,221 --> 00:03:32,900
About 15 years earlier. And so she
had been diagnosed with a murmur,

59
00:03:32,901 --> 00:03:35,420
which is basically just like
a funny sound in your heart.

60
00:03:35,810 --> 00:03:39,710
And that's like a wash in between
the thump, thump, thump, thump.

61
00:03:40,070 --> 00:03:42,620
And in summer's case she had
been told it's no big deal.

62
00:03:42,621 --> 00:03:46,490
And so this was just a
followup appointment to make
sure nothing had changed.

63
00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:48,920
And so she goes to the doctor, she,

64
00:03:48,921 --> 00:03:52,820
they run a few tests and then they send
her on her way and a few weeks later she

65
00:03:52,821 --> 00:03:55,970
gets an email saying don't panic,

66
00:03:59,910 --> 00:04:01,740
but I think you should
see a heart surgeon.

67
00:04:02,460 --> 00:04:03,293
So

68
00:04:05,650 --> 00:04:10,240
it turns out the situation with
her heart had changed her aorta,

69
00:04:10,241 --> 00:04:13,180
which is like the largest
artery coming out of her heart.

70
00:04:13,390 --> 00:04:15,730
It was larger than it should have been.

71
00:04:15,731 --> 00:04:18,310
So it's supposed to be about
two centimeters in diameter.

72
00:04:18,311 --> 00:04:21,760
And in summers case it was five. Yeah.
What does that mean for your bodies?

73
00:04:21,761 --> 00:04:26,600
So that's the thing. It's a seven
dometic. It's not actively harming you,

74
00:04:26,601 --> 00:04:30,200
but it's a threat to your
life because if it ruptures,

75
00:04:31,760 --> 00:04:35,060
it's your main blood
vessel. And if it goes,

76
00:04:35,150 --> 00:04:39,380
you bleed out internally so
fast that no er can help you.

77
00:04:40,550 --> 00:04:44,120
Her doctor says go find a heart
surgeon. And in the meantime,

78
00:04:44,121 --> 00:04:48,450
no heavy lifting or contact sports in
summers. Like, well I live in New York,

79
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:51,270
like living in New York as
the contact sport. Yeah,

80
00:04:51,271 --> 00:04:53,580
I was gonna say if people crash
into you all the time. Yeah.

81
00:04:57,270 --> 00:05:01,770
Six months later, summer finds herself
on the operating table. They actually,

82
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:05,340
um, I think, I'm not sure the
exact order of operations,

83
00:05:05,650 --> 00:05:10,650
but they cut open her sternum from the
bottom all the way up to the top and then

84
00:05:11,861 --> 00:05:13,990
they just like, oh,

85
00:05:15,390 --> 00:05:17,300
the rib cage so they can get at her heart.

86
00:05:17,510 --> 00:05:22,040
They put some sort of fluid on it that
stops it from beating and they actually

87
00:05:22,041 --> 00:05:27,020
sort of just inject that fluid into the
heart and that short circuits it so your

88
00:05:27,021 --> 00:05:32,021
heart actually stops and then
they hook you up to a bypass,

89
00:05:33,921 --> 00:05:35,180
a heart lung bypass machine.

90
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:39,400
And one of the things that does is it
drains the heart of all it's blood.

91
00:05:40,010 --> 00:05:42,220
And so it's like flat, like a pancake.

92
00:05:42,430 --> 00:05:45,940
And you can see pictures
of all of this on her blog.

93
00:05:45,970 --> 00:05:48,730
You can even see pictures. It's true.

94
00:05:48,760 --> 00:05:53,760
You can even see pictures of the a surgeon
cutting four inches out of her aorta

95
00:05:53,870 --> 00:05:58,870
and replacing it with a synthetic tube
and the entire time summer's heart is

96
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:02,110
just lim in quiet.

97
00:06:03,640 --> 00:06:04,090
Okay.

98
00:06:04,090 --> 00:06:05,710
Eight hours later she wakes up.

99
00:06:06,370 --> 00:06:06,880
Yeah.

100
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:10,960
What do you remember about your first
conversation with your doctors? Oh,

101
00:06:10,961 --> 00:06:13,630
I don't remember my
first conversation much,

102
00:06:13,690 --> 00:06:18,190
but I do vividly remember my first
thought part of my friends was,

103
00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:22,700
fuck, this hurts.

104
00:06:24,790 --> 00:06:27,040
Just mind altering pain.

105
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:29,770
Oh my God. Eight hours ago I
felt so much better than this.

106
00:06:29,771 --> 00:06:33,490
Can we just go back to that now?
Like, no, I don't want this. You know,

107
00:06:33,491 --> 00:06:38,491
everything pulls on your torso and so
when your sternum has been cut open and

108
00:06:38,701 --> 00:06:39,630
then reconnected,

109
00:06:40,170 --> 00:06:45,170
everything that pulls on that hurts
and you can't move anything or lift

110
00:06:45,871 --> 00:06:46,704
anything.

111
00:06:46,900 --> 00:06:49,750
It hurt to talk. It even hurt to breathe,

112
00:06:50,070 --> 00:06:53,770
but literally from day
one they make you stand up

113
00:06:57,100 --> 00:07:01,420
and start walking. Really.
I was like, she was like,

114
00:07:01,421 --> 00:07:03,880
we're going to get you to sit and
shower. I was like, no, no, we're not.

115
00:07:04,060 --> 00:07:07,060
What are you talking? What are
you smoking? And that's just to,

116
00:07:08,140 --> 00:07:11,980
that's just to basically, you just got
to get the heart going again, you know,

117
00:07:11,981 --> 00:07:13,270
just get it healing.

118
00:07:14,580 --> 00:07:17,610
But here's the thing, when it came back,

119
00:07:18,180 --> 00:07:22,620
it came back with a
vengeance. So to be fair,

120
00:07:22,621 --> 00:07:27,060
her recovery went really well. About
two months in, she's in cardiac rehab,

121
00:07:27,061 --> 00:07:30,600
the pain is fading. She's thinking
about sending her mother home.

122
00:07:30,601 --> 00:07:34,920
Her mom had been staying with her for
awhile and then one day she's in cardiac

123
00:07:34,921 --> 00:07:37,070
rehab on the elliptical machine.

124
00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:40,880
And so I remember stopping and I had, um,

125
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:46,540
this white tee shirt that would
literally like just be fluttering

126
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:49,830
[inaudible]

127
00:07:49,830 --> 00:07:53,940
with my heartbeat. Like it was
blowing in, in high wind or something.

128
00:07:54,750 --> 00:07:58,470
And I was like, well that's interesting.
You mean that you could see it?

129
00:07:58,710 --> 00:08:02,860
Oh yeah. Yeah. Even the physical therapist
there could see it. What do they do?

130
00:08:03,130 --> 00:08:06,010
They do. You mean like you would look
down and you would see the thing,

131
00:08:06,220 --> 00:08:10,610
your heart beating through your
chest wall, pushing your shirt? Yeah.

132
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:15,100
Off your chest. Well because I'm
a lady, there was a gap here.

133
00:08:15,101 --> 00:08:19,810
So like that sort of, there's a space for
that vibration to happen, so to speak.

134
00:08:22,480 --> 00:08:25,120
But then she goes home and
it was still happening,

135
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:30,290
like just sitting on her couch, not
even working out. She's like, Whoa,

136
00:08:30,740 --> 00:08:34,730
my heart is strong. It
just felt so strong that I,

137
00:08:35,450 --> 00:08:37,540
part of me was like, am I going crazy?

138
00:08:37,541 --> 00:08:40,510
Like is it as strong as it seems
like it is? Because if it is,

139
00:08:40,511 --> 00:08:44,050
surely this is making a noise. So one day,

140
00:08:44,140 --> 00:08:47,410
a few months after surgery,
she goes to upstate New York,

141
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:50,860
she's visiting some family friends and
she's hanging out with their daughter

142
00:08:50,861 --> 00:08:51,694
Julia.

143
00:08:51,710 --> 00:08:56,580
She walked in and we
were standing in my room,

144
00:08:56,880 --> 00:09:00,470
you're just chatting. And then
suddenly Julia's eyes get really wide.

145
00:09:00,690 --> 00:09:05,070
And I was standing there just,
oh my gosh, I just to skirt it.

146
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:10,680
She could hear summer's heart out loud
two feet away from her in the room.

147
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:13,930
And I was like, okay,
this is happening. Uh,

148
00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:17,800
so I guess in typical summer fashion,
she's Kinda like, let's engineer that.

149
00:09:18,280 --> 00:09:21,640
If a friend of mine can hear it with
their ear and what could a studio pick up?

150
00:09:21,670 --> 00:09:23,740
So she grabs her radio producer friend,

151
00:09:23,970 --> 00:09:28,970
they go to a studio and he sticks a Mike
about six inches in front of her chest.

152
00:09:29,560 --> 00:09:31,090
And this is what they recorded.

153
00:09:45,970 --> 00:09:46,070
[inaudible]

154
00:09:46,070 --> 00:09:49,070
this is not a stethoscope.
This is what it sounds like.

155
00:09:49,071 --> 00:09:53,420
If you were standing at quiet
room next to summer, God,

156
00:09:53,421 --> 00:09:55,310
that's strong. What does that feel like?

157
00:09:55,460 --> 00:10:00,460
It just feels as if my entire rib cage,

158
00:10:01,700 --> 00:10:04,610
my clavicle, my sternum,

159
00:10:04,611 --> 00:10:06,800
my whole chest cavity
is acting like an amp.

160
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:13,080
And it's sort of transmitting
the vibrations of each
heartbeat in physically in

161
00:10:14,511 --> 00:10:19,060
my body to feel each RP. Yeah.
Do you feel it right now? Yeah.

162
00:10:19,820 --> 00:10:21,600
You can just feel that thump. Thump. Yep.

163
00:10:22,070 --> 00:10:25,370
It feels like somebody has a rubber
mallet and is banging on the inside of my

164
00:10:25,650 --> 00:10:27,950
store and it's very staccato.

165
00:10:43,900 --> 00:10:46,780
She goes back to the doctor,
she's like, dude, my heart.

166
00:10:47,230 --> 00:10:50,800
So he sort of just did some like
listening and some feeling [inaudible] you

167
00:10:50,801 --> 00:10:53,590
know? And his reaction to was
like, yeah, that's strong.

168
00:10:55,630 --> 00:10:59,110
So we run some tests and he's like,
listen, your blood pressure is fine.

169
00:10:59,230 --> 00:11:03,910
All of your stats are fine. So I
guess I did a really good job. Yay.

170
00:11:03,911 --> 00:11:08,800
Good for you. But, but okay. I guess I
have a strong heart. Yay. Strong heart.

171
00:11:08,801 --> 00:11:12,040
But I don't want to feel this all the
time. The doctor was like, Whoa, Whoa,

172
00:11:12,041 --> 00:11:14,530
whoa. I don't freak
out. This will go away.

173
00:11:15,880 --> 00:11:20,080
It's probably just that there's
scar tissue on your sternum and it's

174
00:11:20,081 --> 00:11:24,760
transmitting the vibration and is that
goes away. The sensation should fade.

175
00:11:24,820 --> 00:11:29,820
He said sometimes six to nine months is
when maybe the Scar Tissue Heals more

176
00:11:31,331 --> 00:11:35,380
thins out. So she's like, all right,
nine months. Oh, I can get to that.

177
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:36,280
That's no problem.

178
00:11:36,370 --> 00:11:40,690
So she sorta just settled in and
treated it like a scientific curiosity,

179
00:11:40,760 --> 00:11:43,530
like a party trick. If I went to, um,

180
00:11:43,690 --> 00:11:46,480
a restaurant where they
had like tables for two,

181
00:11:46,510 --> 00:11:48,850
but they weren't like
the sturdiest of tables.

182
00:11:48,910 --> 00:11:52,990
If we had water glasses on them and
I, I sort of leaned on the table,

183
00:11:53,260 --> 00:11:57,220
like the water glass would
look like Jurassic Park.

184
00:11:58,530 --> 00:12:02,830
Like my heartbeat would be like
the footsteps of the Toyota Sys.

185
00:12:04,590 --> 00:12:06,330
Yeah. So that was like my party's drag.

186
00:12:06,410 --> 00:12:09,910
Do you had six months of elation
party trick and then, yeah.

187
00:12:09,970 --> 00:12:12,480
And then it stopped being a
party trick it sounds like. Yeah.

188
00:12:12,970 --> 00:12:16,600
What happened and I'm not really
sure like you know incident wise,

189
00:12:16,601 --> 00:12:19,240
I think for me it was just time passing

190
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:27,510
cause that nine month mark just came
and went and it was still there and when

191
00:12:27,511 --> 00:12:30,810
she asks her doctor, he has no idea why.

192
00:12:31,410 --> 00:12:34,860
So 12 months still there,

193
00:12:36,630 --> 00:12:41,630
15 months it's still there and she says
it just started getting really annoying

194
00:12:43,690 --> 00:12:45,470
if it's distracting. The,

195
00:12:45,480 --> 00:12:50,190
the funny thing was the more active I
was than the less aware of it I was.

196
00:12:50,250 --> 00:12:55,250
But she says when she was at her office
trying to be still be still to either be

197
00:12:55,591 --> 00:12:58,980
writing something, writing
emails, planning lectures,

198
00:12:59,580 --> 00:13:00,930
that's when it would be like

199
00:13:05,740 --> 00:13:09,760
really loud. That's when it would
become the most dominant thing. Like I,

200
00:13:09,850 --> 00:13:14,850
I couldn't go to work because it just
kept drawing my focus and when it did it

201
00:13:15,611 --> 00:13:18,100
would just fill her with anxiety.

202
00:13:19,100 --> 00:13:23,210
It was sort of this like automatic
response, and I'll try and explain it,

203
00:13:23,211 --> 00:13:26,030
but it's basically like
when you get scared,

204
00:13:26,060 --> 00:13:29,990
it goes into your brain and then
the signal goes down into your body.

205
00:13:30,260 --> 00:13:33,200
So you step on a snake and your brain
is like, oh my God, it's a snake run,

206
00:13:33,201 --> 00:13:36,890
body run, and then your heart
pounds. In Summers case,

207
00:13:36,891 --> 00:13:40,550
it was just the opposite. There was
no snake, but her heart was pounding.

208
00:13:41,010 --> 00:13:44,390
So her brain would be like, Whoa,
why is my heart pounding? Oh my God,

209
00:13:44,391 --> 00:13:48,560
is there a snake? There must be a snake
run body run in her heart would pound.

210
00:13:49,010 --> 00:13:52,310
My brain keeps thinking something
must be wrong because we're having,

211
00:13:52,311 --> 00:13:54,560
we're already doing this,
so something must be wrong,

212
00:13:54,561 --> 00:13:56,120
so I guess something's
wrong. So let's freak out.

213
00:13:56,510 --> 00:14:01,510
She was caught in this feedback loop
and then she was like rightly so,

214
00:14:01,970 --> 00:14:06,860
edgy and primed that any emotion on top
of that, like even if it was happiness,

215
00:14:07,250 --> 00:14:10,700
was just too much. Oh my gosh. Yeah.
Nights. It would keep me awake.

216
00:14:10,850 --> 00:14:11,780
I would focus on it.

217
00:14:15,830 --> 00:14:16,070
[inaudible]

218
00:14:16,070 --> 00:14:18,700
I would get into hearing the
rhythm, feeling the rhythm

219
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:21,393
[inaudible]

220
00:14:21,450 --> 00:14:23,420
yeah, sort of with the expectation of just

221
00:14:23,740 --> 00:14:27,790
next one. Next one.

222
00:14:29,860 --> 00:14:34,390
Next one. Next one.

223
00:14:36,010 --> 00:14:40,880
Next one. Next one. Next one. Next one.

224
00:14:42,970 --> 00:14:46,990
Next one. Next one. Next one.

225
00:14:47,590 --> 00:14:52,190
Next one. Next one. Next one.

226
00:14:52,191 --> 00:14:55,730
Next one. Next one. Next one.

227
00:14:56,750 --> 00:14:59,090
Next one. [inaudible]

228
00:15:00,100 --> 00:15:01,180
with every beat.

229
00:15:01,240 --> 00:15:06,240
Our hearts are just literally tapping
out time and I mean researchers have

230
00:15:06,461 --> 00:15:10,540
actually thought about this and there
was this idea that was proposed like a

231
00:15:10,541 --> 00:15:15,541
right before the dawn of sort of modern
heart surgery that we each get 1 billion

232
00:15:15,970 --> 00:15:18,040
beats in our lifetime and then that's it.

233
00:15:18,940 --> 00:15:21,370
And most of us don't notice them going by,

234
00:15:21,371 --> 00:15:23,560
but in summer's case
she can't not notice it.

235
00:15:23,650 --> 00:15:27,580
Yeah, I'm aware of it
all. It's never not there.

236
00:15:28,960 --> 00:15:31,720
It's never not noticeable that

237
00:15:33,970 --> 00:15:38,020
maybe it's just like this constant
awareness of the future that summer is

238
00:15:38,021 --> 00:15:39,760
endlessly meditating on.

239
00:15:39,790 --> 00:15:44,790
My heart takes over and I can't do the
things that I want to do and not knowing

240
00:15:44,861 --> 00:15:49,861
if that's going to last forever or if
it's going to end suddenly or if it's just

241
00:15:51,281 --> 00:15:55,600
going to Peter out. The
not knowing gets to me.

242
00:15:56,720 --> 00:16:01,280
So she stopped going out as much and
she stopped returning phone calls except

243
00:16:01,281 --> 00:16:03,290
for like a few close group of friends.

244
00:16:03,610 --> 00:16:08,610
Times were just being curled
up in bed and just crying.

245
00:16:10,500 --> 00:16:14,160
It really wanted to yell
at my heart, shut up. Stop.

246
00:16:14,370 --> 00:16:15,690
Which you really talk to your heart. Well,

247
00:16:15,691 --> 00:16:19,350
I mean I would never had conversations
but I would be like shut the fuck up.

248
00:16:23,210 --> 00:16:24,043
But it wouldn't.

249
00:16:27,260 --> 00:16:31,670
And as time went on, like
the constant pounding,

250
00:16:31,910 --> 00:16:35,020
it just became unbearable. She just

251
00:16:35,100 --> 00:16:37,710
scribes it as like this alien creature.

252
00:16:38,370 --> 00:16:41,460
It's like trying to just claw it's way out

253
00:16:42,460 --> 00:16:43,510
the bottom of my neck.

254
00:17:15,970 --> 00:17:16,803
[inaudible] fine.

255
00:17:17,790 --> 00:17:21,290
But there was this one moment right in
the middle of [inaudible], middle of

256
00:17:21,290 --> 00:17:22,010
all of this.

257
00:17:22,010 --> 00:17:27,010
She had her two year checkup postsurgery
and for that they had to take a picture

258
00:17:27,441 --> 00:17:32,120
of her heart. So I schedule my two year
appointment and to look at her heart,

259
00:17:32,121 --> 00:17:34,910
they do an echocardiogram,
which is basically,

260
00:17:34,911 --> 00:17:37,910
you know like the ultrasound like
that you get for the pregnant.

261
00:17:38,090 --> 00:17:40,250
Oh it's like a wand.
Yeah. It's like a little,

262
00:17:40,280 --> 00:17:45,280
a little wand and you get the jelly and
they basically go all over your upper,

263
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:49,410
you know, the area around your
heart and from all different angles.

264
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:54,750
So what ended up happening is I'm lying
on my left side and I'm facing the wall

265
00:17:54,751 --> 00:17:58,740
and the technicians behind me and the
technician is sort of like reaching around

266
00:17:58,741 --> 00:17:59,041
her,

267
00:17:59,041 --> 00:18:04,020
waving the wand over her heart and the
monitor for the echocardiogram is behind

268
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:06,930
summer so she can't see it,
but she's wearing eyeglasses.

269
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:09,360
So you know how you can
sometimes like see a reflection,

270
00:18:09,900 --> 00:18:13,410
a peripherally on your glasses of
something that's like behind you.

271
00:18:13,710 --> 00:18:16,380
Like if you are in a somewhat
darker room, there was a window,

272
00:18:16,381 --> 00:18:19,680
like you would totally see the reflection.
So the room's a little bit darkened.

273
00:18:19,710 --> 00:18:24,710
Summer's lying there on her side and
she sees the reflection of the screen,

274
00:18:25,340 --> 00:18:29,340
um, on my glasses and it catches your eye
because it's moving and then I realize

275
00:18:29,341 --> 00:18:30,200
what it is that I'm,

276
00:18:30,310 --> 00:18:35,310
I'm seeing a tiny reflection of her
heart beating and I have this like moment

277
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:38,850
[inaudible]

278
00:18:38,850 --> 00:18:41,390
I have this moment where
I'm like, oh my gosh your,

279
00:18:41,391 --> 00:18:43,100
I'm like talking to my
heart and in my head going,

280
00:18:43,450 --> 00:18:46,580
well we had your working hard.
Like you're trying your hardest,

281
00:18:46,581 --> 00:18:50,530
you're doing the best that you can. I'm,

282
00:18:50,590 --> 00:18:51,680
I'm doing the best that I can.

283
00:18:51,710 --> 00:18:56,000
You're in there and you're working and
you are working for me and we are on the

284
00:18:56,001 --> 00:19:00,110
same team and I just totally like,
I just silently start crying.

285
00:19:06,440 --> 00:19:06,870
No

286
00:19:06,870 --> 00:19:09,350
like what do you think spurred that on?

287
00:19:09,351 --> 00:19:14,351
Like what was it about seeing it or
there's just something about physically

288
00:19:14,801 --> 00:19:19,350
seeing it but feeling it at the same time.

289
00:19:19,351 --> 00:19:23,970
Like knowing that I'm seeing what's
happening inside me that somehow just like

290
00:19:25,300 --> 00:19:27,640
clicked this understanding into place.

291
00:19:28,980 --> 00:19:32,250
She said there was something
about seeing it in real time,

292
00:19:32,251 --> 00:19:34,830
like feeling this thing in her chest,

293
00:19:35,040 --> 00:19:39,510
just pulsing in rhythm with what was
happening on the screen and then suddenly

294
00:19:39,511 --> 00:19:42,900
it just, it didn't seem
separate from her anymore.

295
00:19:43,140 --> 00:19:46,080
And all of those worries about the
future and what was going to happen and

296
00:19:46,081 --> 00:19:48,900
wasn't going to go away and every,
she's just stopped. She was just like,

297
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:49,833
no,

298
00:19:49,960 --> 00:19:54,800
you are just beating and that
beating is me. It was sort of,

299
00:19:54,830 --> 00:19:56,060
it was sort of like this moment of,

300
00:19:56,360 --> 00:20:00,440
of recognition of its
purpose and its work and,

301
00:20:01,010 --> 00:20:02,210
and sort of this,

302
00:20:04,950 --> 00:20:09,950
so it's kind of like that whole idea of
when you feel like you see somebody not

303
00:20:11,041 --> 00:20:13,830
just physically, like you see who
they are, you see what they are,

304
00:20:13,831 --> 00:20:17,760
but you see who they are. Like I had
that, like I felt like I see you heart,

305
00:20:18,390 --> 00:20:22,410
like I see what you're doing, I
see what your purpose is. I see.

306
00:20:22,560 --> 00:20:23,520
I see you.

307
00:20:25,870 --> 00:20:30,280
On the one hand, what she sees
like with her engineer's brain is,

308
00:20:30,310 --> 00:20:34,970
oh I get you. You're just a pump.
And it's that same, you know,

309
00:20:35,050 --> 00:20:37,840
realization that essentially
led to modern medicine. Right?

310
00:20:37,841 --> 00:20:42,340
Like the minute we took the soul out of
the heart, we were willing to touch it,

311
00:20:42,341 --> 00:20:45,190
to cut it open, a stitch it
up to start fixing things.

312
00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:50,520
And now we have lifespans by some
estimates are 2.5 billion beats.

313
00:20:52,780 --> 00:20:57,250
But on the other hand, like when
you hear someone's heartbeat,

314
00:20:57,700 --> 00:21:02,700
your parents or your child's in
that beat is an entire lifetime.

315
00:21:03,701 --> 00:21:08,320
It's a, it's a history of beats.
It's a series of beats yet to come.

316
00:21:08,321 --> 00:21:12,040
And I don't know, thinking
about all that, I just,

317
00:21:12,190 --> 00:21:16,330
I just sort of got walloped at
the end of this interview. Um,

318
00:21:16,420 --> 00:21:20,080
when summer asked us if we wanted
to try and listen to her heart.

319
00:21:20,370 --> 00:21:22,980
Can we try that? Just see
you. Do you want to, yeah,

320
00:21:23,180 --> 00:21:25,950
let's just move the mic or
I'll stand up or something.

321
00:21:26,340 --> 00:21:30,150
So she stood up from her chair and she
sort of put her chest right in front of

322
00:21:30,151 --> 00:21:33,900
the mic and then we all
just got really quiet. Okay.

323
00:21:36,330 --> 00:21:38,700
Oh my God. Oh my God.

324
00:21:51,410 --> 00:21:54,290
Oh my God. Wow. It's this made,
it makes me really emotional.

325
00:21:54,320 --> 00:21:57,320
Every time I hear it, it
makes my eyes, well it's here.

326
00:21:59,060 --> 00:22:02,960
It's really amazing. I guess I still got

327
00:22:08,030 --> 00:22:11,250
kitchen art. You Go. Yeah.

328
00:22:13,800 --> 00:22:15,840
So give it up for Radiolab
producer Molly [inaudible]

329
00:22:22,620 --> 00:22:24,300
[inaudible] and give it up the soap for,

330
00:22:26,970 --> 00:22:30,510
yeah. When you said earlier that a lot
of people in the audience had a strong

331
00:22:30,511 --> 00:22:33,750
reactions, usually we met, I mean I
don't know if you could tune this in,

332
00:22:33,751 --> 00:22:34,080
but like

333
00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:37,030
when we were doing that story I just
definitely seem like something's going on

334
00:22:37,031 --> 00:22:39,820
out there. I couldn't tell cause we
were on stage, I couldn't, you know,

335
00:22:39,821 --> 00:22:41,470
this is their 20 I
definitely was tuning in.

336
00:22:41,471 --> 00:22:43,930
There's something going on in the
audience, something going on side stage,

337
00:22:43,931 --> 00:22:45,100
but I didn't really know what it was.

338
00:22:45,101 --> 00:22:50,020
We were in the middle of it walk off
stage and the first thing we hear is that

339
00:22:50,560 --> 00:22:55,460
numerous people had fainted, even vomited
during that piece. We were like, what?

340
00:22:56,230 --> 00:22:59,920
Seriously? I did not see a
coming. No, we were really,

341
00:23:00,250 --> 00:23:04,210
really scared at first and I thought,
oh my God, am I, am I killing people?

342
00:23:04,500 --> 00:23:08,560
What just happened. I'm like, like it
was just like, I was like, were they old?

343
00:23:08,561 --> 00:23:10,720
Were they young? Like
what? Like why were young,

344
00:23:10,750 --> 00:23:12,700
they were young and that
made me like, oh okay.

345
00:23:12,700 --> 00:23:16,210
They feel like weirdly a
little bit better. Maybe
they can handle it. And yeah,

346
00:23:16,300 --> 00:23:20,710
I just was, and then I, it was kind
of weirdly mortified. Terrified.

347
00:23:20,920 --> 00:23:24,130
But after we figured out that no
one was hurt, we were like, we got,

348
00:23:24,190 --> 00:23:25,850
we were like, we would,

349
00:23:25,970 --> 00:23:28,090
we do start putting out and we started
making some calls cause we were like,

350
00:23:28,091 --> 00:23:31,240
what was that? What did we make of that?
What is that good? I didn't know you.

351
00:23:31,241 --> 00:23:34,030
So the show is over and we all go home.

352
00:23:34,031 --> 00:23:37,530
This is days after this is days and you're
thinking, oh my God, we're going to,

353
00:23:37,720 --> 00:23:40,270
yeah, cause I'm thinking we've got
a podcast, this damn thing, right?

354
00:23:40,271 --> 00:23:40,660
We have to,

355
00:23:40,660 --> 00:23:43,600
we have to understand this and say
something that's completely right.

356
00:23:43,690 --> 00:23:46,550
So the first person we
called a was a psychiatrist,

357
00:23:46,620 --> 00:23:51,300
Rachel Yehuda, Mount Sinai School of
Medicine, Department of Psychiatry.

358
00:23:51,430 --> 00:23:54,250
I explained to her the basic situation
that that some people had fainted and

359
00:23:54,251 --> 00:23:56,140
felt woozy. We weren't
quite sure how many,

360
00:23:56,150 --> 00:23:58,710
five or six people out of 2100,

361
00:23:59,350 --> 00:24:04,170
somewhere between five
and a 12. We don't have a,

362
00:24:04,171 --> 00:24:05,560
a clear number just yet.

363
00:24:05,620 --> 00:24:06,670
That's very interesting.

364
00:24:06,710 --> 00:24:09,980
Do you have any sense of what might've
caused this? Just like a guess.

365
00:24:10,270 --> 00:24:15,010
So my best guess about that would
be that they have activated their

366
00:24:15,011 --> 00:24:19,660
parasympathetic nervous system in
response to hearing the heartbeat.

367
00:24:19,990 --> 00:24:20,681
Yeah. Just to explain.

368
00:24:20,681 --> 00:24:23,650
Our autonomic nervous system is divided
into a bunch of different parts.

369
00:24:23,651 --> 00:24:25,720
You've got your
sympathetic nervous system,

370
00:24:25,721 --> 00:24:27,220
which is sort of your
fight or flight, right?

371
00:24:27,430 --> 00:24:31,150
Sweat turns on when you're scared and
then you got your parasympathetic nervous

372
00:24:31,151 --> 00:24:33,700
system, which is sort of the opposite.

373
00:24:33,820 --> 00:24:37,540
Rather than getting you ready to
fight or run, it makes you calm.

374
00:24:37,900 --> 00:24:42,310
And Dr you Hooda says it in certain
people that parasympathetic response can

375
00:24:42,520 --> 00:24:47,230
actually kind of go overboard and
there lud pressure can drop quickly too

376
00:24:47,231 --> 00:24:49,080
quickly and they end up fainting.

377
00:24:49,140 --> 00:24:51,300
Now, the most common, um,

378
00:24:52,140 --> 00:24:54,420
stimulus for this to happen in,

379
00:24:54,870 --> 00:24:58,170
in real life is failing
at the sight of blood.

380
00:24:58,710 --> 00:25:03,710
Some people just do that and it's not
that common about two to 4% of the

381
00:25:03,841 --> 00:25:06,750
population have this kind of a response.

382
00:25:07,680 --> 00:25:10,290
And we don't exactly know why it happens.

383
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:14,790
There is some opinion that the idea
of fainting when you see blood,

384
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:17,910
is it an adaptive evolutionary response

385
00:25:18,180 --> 00:25:20,940
that you know, maybe back in the day
when we were being chased by predators,

386
00:25:20,941 --> 00:25:22,160
it would have been a good idea to faint

387
00:25:22,310 --> 00:25:24,380
because maybe the animal
will think you're dead.

388
00:25:24,580 --> 00:25:28,280
Then he'll skip you. He wants a live
meat and you're dead meat. Exactly.

389
00:25:28,300 --> 00:25:30,730
He sees you laying there and he's like,
I don't want to eat that. What he bet.

390
00:25:30,970 --> 00:25:34,180
Another theory is this isn't
also an evolutionary one,

391
00:25:34,181 --> 00:25:38,070
is that if your blood pressure
drops like it does when you faint,

392
00:25:38,200 --> 00:25:41,560
well that kind of protects you a little
bit because you'll have less blood in

393
00:25:41,561 --> 00:25:45,370
your arms and legs. So if your arms
and legs get bitten by a lion, say,

394
00:25:45,371 --> 00:25:49,180
then you're less likely to bleed out.
Mm. Let me see. So there's nothing,

395
00:25:49,210 --> 00:25:53,230
there's nothing juicy to suck on if your
blood is on not in your wing or your

396
00:25:53,231 --> 00:25:56,080
limb. Yeah. And basically, I mean,
who knows, these are just stories,

397
00:25:56,081 --> 00:25:58,900
but going back to the two or 4% thing,

398
00:25:58,990 --> 00:26:03,990
we got to thinking two to 4% of
our audience that night would be,

399
00:26:05,470 --> 00:26:09,010
what do we decide Molly was
like 40 people, 44 to 88,

400
00:26:09,490 --> 00:26:12,640
44 to 88, 2100.

401
00:26:12,970 --> 00:26:15,040
So we put out some emails, uh,

402
00:26:15,310 --> 00:26:19,360
looked at the incident reports and I
think now we have identified how many,

403
00:26:19,630 --> 00:26:23,710
what do we get to for us, we've heard
of maybe 10 or 11 at this point,

404
00:26:23,740 --> 00:26:24,460
10 or 11 net.

405
00:26:24,460 --> 00:26:28,690
But I think that based on some of the
stories that are coming in that the number

406
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:33,340
might actually be much higher than
that cause it was, um, for example,

407
00:26:33,400 --> 00:26:38,400
it just manifested itself physically in
a way that I could not have imagined a

408
00:26:38,560 --> 00:26:42,010
would be the case. This
is Maria Checo who, uh,

409
00:26:42,011 --> 00:26:46,860
actually works the street from us, uh,
for the company that makes Latino USA.

410
00:26:46,990 --> 00:26:50,970
I was sitting in the front,
uh, against one of the walls,

411
00:26:50,971 --> 00:26:54,360
but not right at the wall. She says,
uh, she was listening to the story.

412
00:26:54,361 --> 00:26:58,680
Everything was fine at first, but
then she says, as the beat kept going,

413
00:26:58,800 --> 00:27:02,490
she began to worry,
what if it never stops?

414
00:27:02,490 --> 00:27:04,420
What if summer never
gets away from it? And,

415
00:27:04,500 --> 00:27:08,700
and then the drumming got more
intense and it was just like, oh no,

416
00:27:09,450 --> 00:27:09,991
oh no.

417
00:27:09,991 --> 00:27:12,900
And it was definitely the sense of being
trapped that the thing that was giving

418
00:27:12,901 --> 00:27:16,020
her life, which was absolutely necessary,

419
00:27:16,050 --> 00:27:19,710
was also the thing that
was tormenting her.

420
00:27:19,950 --> 00:27:21,540
And she says that she
was thinking about that.

421
00:27:21,630 --> 00:27:23,610
She just kinda got short of breath.

422
00:27:23,640 --> 00:27:28,640
And so I looked at my husband
and put my hands up like I like,

423
00:27:28,681 --> 00:27:32,310
I gotta go. And he, he looked at
me, he was like, are you all right?

424
00:27:32,311 --> 00:27:36,900
And I was like, I shook my
head like, no. And um, and I,

425
00:27:36,990 --> 00:27:39,180
and then I had the talk
in my brain like, okay,

426
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:43,500
this is an intimate radio moment.
You are right in the front area.

427
00:27:43,501 --> 00:27:47,460
If you get up six people have to
get up with you, what are you doing?

428
00:27:47,460 --> 00:27:51,120
You're ruining this for everybody.
Just breathe and it'll be fine.

429
00:27:51,121 --> 00:27:55,680
And then the deeper I tried to breathe,
the more anxious I sort of got like,

430
00:27:55,710 --> 00:28:00,450
oh, and I had this fantasy of like
standing up and doing like a room

431
00:28:02,370 --> 00:28:04,920
to wiggle it out of me.
But I was like, that's

432
00:28:07,420 --> 00:28:11,790
just to suck it up. And
so Jeez, look at that.

433
00:28:11,791 --> 00:28:13,350
I'm having trouble breathing
just thinking about it.

434
00:28:13,840 --> 00:28:16,200
[inaudible] I don't want to put you
back there. No, no, no, no. I'm fine.

435
00:28:16,230 --> 00:28:17,063
I'm fine. I'm fine.

436
00:28:17,210 --> 00:28:20,840
But that's why my hunches at there
might be a lot more than 10 because uh,

437
00:28:21,030 --> 00:28:23,940
maybe a lot of people just sort of
pushed through and didn't get up.

438
00:28:24,030 --> 00:28:25,410
It still felt weird. In any case,

439
00:28:25,411 --> 00:28:29,070
one of the most interesting things that
we bumped into is that Dr Yehuda told us

440
00:28:29,100 --> 00:28:32,190
it's very possible that the
fainting and the wooziness. Okay.

441
00:28:32,500 --> 00:28:34,450
He's some kind of an empathy response.

442
00:28:35,460 --> 00:28:37,170
Really. In what sense?

443
00:28:37,480 --> 00:28:38,080
Well,

444
00:28:38,080 --> 00:28:42,750
if you hear somebody's heart beating and
you're aware that that's what you are

445
00:28:42,751 --> 00:28:43,330
hearing,

446
00:28:43,330 --> 00:28:48,330
it might arouse a tremendous connection
within you of hearing the very source of

447
00:28:49,991 --> 00:28:51,070
their life. Yeah.

448
00:28:51,240 --> 00:28:55,020
I became her. I did. I
just, I was there with her

449
00:28:55,290 --> 00:28:59,540
can really be a lot to take in and
you feel a little faint or emotional.

450
00:28:59,620 --> 00:29:04,620
I just identified so much with somebody
being trapped in their own body.

451
00:29:06,100 --> 00:29:10,430
It's like she couldn't escape.
It was beating in my chest. Wow.

452
00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:15,480
The drums I felt were beating in
my chest and in my crazy fantasy.

453
00:29:15,971 --> 00:29:18,550
You know, maybe they were
breathing at the same rhythm.

454
00:29:18,610 --> 00:29:23,020
One of the people that emailed that to
the live show said that he felt like his

455
00:29:23,021 --> 00:29:27,460
heart was trying to match her beat
and he couldn't catch his breath.

456
00:29:27,490 --> 00:29:30,880
I don't know. I haven't, I don't know.
It's never happened to me before. No.

457
00:29:31,330 --> 00:29:32,163
Wow.

458
00:29:32,410 --> 00:29:35,380
I asked her in the end if she'd ever
want to hear summer's heartbeat again and

459
00:29:35,500 --> 00:29:37,090
she said, oh yeah. In fact,

460
00:29:37,091 --> 00:29:39,580
she said she was going to listen to
the story as soon as it was podcasts,

461
00:29:39,850 --> 00:29:43,600
which is now because now she's got all
these questions like was it the acoustics

462
00:29:43,601 --> 00:29:47,980
of the space or the fact that she was
with so many people or maybe it was the

463
00:29:47,981 --> 00:29:51,610
volume cause it was pretty loud and
will I feel the same when I hear it,

464
00:29:52,120 --> 00:29:56,230
you know, with my headphones on or
you know, while I'm driving we'll,

465
00:29:56,231 --> 00:29:56,861
I have that feeling.

466
00:29:56,861 --> 00:29:59,890
So I had already decided that I was
definitely going to listen to it again.

467
00:30:00,460 --> 00:30:01,360
We'll let you know what happens.

468
00:30:11,990 --> 00:30:12,430
[inaudible]

469
00:30:12,430 --> 00:30:14,140
sure. We got a break. Just want
to say this. So percussion.

470
00:30:14,141 --> 00:30:16,540
Who provided all the music so far? Um,

471
00:30:16,960 --> 00:30:20,110
they've just released an album called
music for wood and strings written by

472
00:30:20,500 --> 00:30:23,550
Bryce deserter of the national.
This is what you're hearing. It's,

473
00:30:23,890 --> 00:30:25,090
it's kind of an amazing piece.

474
00:30:27,880 --> 00:30:28,713

Hey, I'm Jad Abumrad.

501
00:32:04,450 --> 00:32:08,940
I'm Robert Krulwich Radiolab and we're
back now going to take you back live on

502
00:32:09,580 --> 00:32:11,140
stage at the Brooklyn Academy of Music.

503
00:32:11,410 --> 00:32:13,810
And this next store you'll hear
some references to some pictures,

504
00:32:13,811 --> 00:32:15,220
which obviously you won't be able to see,

505
00:32:15,520 --> 00:32:18,470
but we've got them for
you@radiolab.org um,

506
00:32:18,910 --> 00:32:22,390
so we want to finish the night with a
salute to a guy who's been on our program

507
00:32:22,391 --> 00:32:25,090
and part of our family pretty
much from the beginning.

508
00:32:25,120 --> 00:32:29,050
I have known him for more than 35 years.

509
00:32:29,500 --> 00:32:30,910
Early on when Radiolab started,

510
00:32:30,911 --> 00:32:33,520
I asked him if he'd help us out
and send us a few story ideas.

511
00:32:33,521 --> 00:32:38,380
He didn't send us a few. He sent us
bushels, tales of chemistry and medicine,

512
00:32:38,660 --> 00:32:39,980
hallucinations, music

513
00:32:39,980 --> 00:32:40,341
people,

514
00:32:40,341 --> 00:32:45,290
so many extraordinary people that he
knew or found or help cause the guy just

515
00:32:45,291 --> 00:32:47,810
doesn't run out. Dr. Oliver Sacks.

516
00:32:55,190 --> 00:32:56,010
[inaudible] is a guy who

517
00:32:56,010 --> 00:32:58,980
he notices everything.
He's deeply interested in.

518
00:32:59,220 --> 00:33:00,920
Everything that happens
around him and to him.

519
00:33:00,930 --> 00:33:04,680
And tonight we're bringing him back on
tape for what Alaska may be his final

520
00:33:04,710 --> 00:33:06,450
offering for us. As many of you know,

521
00:33:06,900 --> 00:33:11,100
Dr Sachs recently was diagnosed with liver
cancer and he wrote about this in the

522
00:33:11,101 --> 00:33:14,270
New York Times. He said he plans
to spend the time that he has, uh,

523
00:33:14,430 --> 00:33:17,730
left writing being with
friends, not doing interviews,

524
00:33:17,731 --> 00:33:20,210
but he did agree to share his
thoughts exclusively with,

525
00:33:20,211 --> 00:33:25,080
with us tonight for you gathered here.
Um, cause he's one of our family.

526
00:33:25,710 --> 00:33:27,450
So as I've done for decades now,

527
00:33:27,451 --> 00:33:30,600
I went over to his house in Manhattan
with my Mike and I said to him,

528
00:33:31,140 --> 00:33:35,400
I just need to know like what, what
just happened a month and a half ago.

529
00:33:35,430 --> 00:33:39,330
You were fine. And then what? Um,

530
00:33:40,500 --> 00:33:45,180
at the beginning of the year I
was fine. On the 3rd of January,

531
00:33:45,181 --> 00:33:50,181
I felt a little queer and I pass some
dark here and I thought I had a little

532
00:33:51,511 --> 00:33:53,770
gallbladder attack and um,

533
00:33:54,280 --> 00:33:58,590
didn't pay that much attention but
thought I better get things checked.

534
00:33:59,130 --> 00:34:01,890
And um, the extra way,

535
00:34:01,891 --> 00:34:05,430
which was expected only to
show a couple of gallstones,

536
00:34:05,820 --> 00:34:09,990
showed hundreds of cysts in my liver.

537
00:34:13,030 --> 00:34:15,370
Uh, although my doctor said
he didn't know what the, his,

538
00:34:15,570 --> 00:34:19,530
what and I would need further
tests, I, I knew what they were.

539
00:34:20,370 --> 00:34:21,540
I said, it's happened

540
00:34:23,050 --> 00:34:23,841
and he was right.

541
00:34:23,841 --> 00:34:27,950
The doctors eventually confirmed that
a cancer that had been found in his eye

542
00:34:27,970 --> 00:34:31,330
nine years ago had spread
to his liver. Where you

543
00:34:32,910 --> 00:34:37,910
frightened or relieved or console or what,

544
00:34:38,450 --> 00:34:39,790
what? No, I,

545
00:34:41,900 --> 00:34:46,010
I think my first feeling was
one of of overwhelming sadness.

546
00:34:47,600 --> 00:34:52,160
Um, there are all sorts
of things I will see. Um,

547
00:34:52,610 --> 00:34:57,170
and I won't do one or two people have
written to me in the know consoling me and

548
00:34:57,350 --> 00:35:01,490
said, well, you know, we all die, but
fuck it. It's not like we all die.

549
00:35:02,390 --> 00:35:04,130
It's like you have four months.

550
00:35:07,500 --> 00:35:10,140
Has that has your pro, what is
your prognosis at this moment?

551
00:35:10,230 --> 00:35:13,830
Cause I know you had an
well it's, it gets revised.

552
00:35:13,860 --> 00:35:17,610
It depends on of course on how the
cancer responds to treatments and or how

553
00:35:17,611 --> 00:35:21,030
quickly it spreads so far. Um,

554
00:35:21,680 --> 00:35:23,510
the metasticies from my eye,

555
00:35:23,560 --> 00:35:28,560
I only in my liver I'm told they love
liver actually I love liver as well and

556
00:35:30,530 --> 00:35:34,570
one of the magical things I did was to
go and have live one on the sued often

557
00:35:34,600 --> 00:35:37,980
the backers and thinking

558
00:35:37,980 --> 00:35:39,450
that liver looks better than mine.

559
00:35:40,840 --> 00:35:43,950
See this is what he's like instead of
being frightened by the thing is trying to

560
00:35:43,951 --> 00:35:44,371
kill him.

561
00:35:44,371 --> 00:35:48,600
He's thinking about loving liver and
liver lovers and looking for connections

562
00:35:48,601 --> 00:35:50,040
and wondering and he doesn't stop. He,

563
00:35:50,280 --> 00:35:54,330
he just notices that the case in point a
few months ago, his doctor said to him,

564
00:35:54,331 --> 00:35:54,931
we're going to run a,

565
00:35:54,931 --> 00:35:59,670
a line up your liver and in effect we're
going to try to shave off a starved

566
00:35:59,671 --> 00:36:02,580
some of the cancer cells first on one
side then on the other to see if we can

567
00:36:02,581 --> 00:36:07,470
give you a little more time. But they
warned him as the metasticies die.

568
00:36:07,680 --> 00:36:11,640
They um, put out various unpleasant
chemicals that may exhaust you,

569
00:36:11,641 --> 00:36:15,240
tax your system badly.
And um, at one point,

570
00:36:15,241 --> 00:36:16,920
shortly after the procedures,

571
00:36:16,950 --> 00:36:20,670
I started talking a
little strangely and um,

572
00:36:20,700 --> 00:36:24,150
as I was talking I was also writing, um,

573
00:36:24,720 --> 00:36:27,030
you'll be the first person to see this.

574
00:36:27,390 --> 00:36:32,390
So he showed me a notebook and we're
showing it to you in just a moment and you

575
00:36:32,521 --> 00:36:35,820
can see they're sort of writing
there on the left. It's all,

576
00:36:35,821 --> 00:36:38,910
he's writing a book, actually a children's
book about the elementary table.

577
00:36:39,300 --> 00:36:42,630
But as he was writing, if you,
if you look to the next page,

578
00:36:42,870 --> 00:36:47,610
if you can see that it gets a little
bit wobbly, the letters and then,

579
00:36:48,290 --> 00:36:52,690
and then there was some crossing
out there. Yes, I see. And then La,

580
00:36:52,691 --> 00:36:57,330
the dramatically, the lighting
changes it actually there is,

581
00:36:57,390 --> 00:37:00,630
there's a large slash
across it and then you,

582
00:37:00,660 --> 00:37:03,820
it seems a little incoherent
at the bottomless. Okay.

583
00:37:04,330 --> 00:37:09,330
And then it turns to pure scribble
that has delirium and crept up on me.

584
00:37:11,010 --> 00:37:14,160
All this happened over the course of 10
minutes and I see what he's doing here.

585
00:37:14,161 --> 00:37:17,430
He's figuring, okay, I'm
riding at a constant speed.

586
00:37:17,580 --> 00:37:21,630
I know pretty much how fast I
right, and so I can time this out.

587
00:37:21,631 --> 00:37:25,950
I can figure out exactly how long it took
me to slip into delirium and then out

588
00:37:25,951 --> 00:37:29,620
of this delirium and he's doing this
very, very sick man. It's science.

589
00:37:29,770 --> 00:37:32,700
The time to write it out
in a more medical way.

590
00:37:32,760 --> 00:37:35,070
I think this would form
a lovely illustration.

591
00:37:35,280 --> 00:37:40,140
You put in a timeline of
delirium just coming like that.

592
00:37:40,200 --> 00:37:42,000
Why aren't you more frantic?

593
00:37:42,390 --> 00:37:45,660
Unusual for any doctor
and as a man of science,

594
00:37:45,661 --> 00:37:50,340
you don't seem to worry at all. When
things become incoherent or strange,

595
00:37:50,670 --> 00:37:53,250
you're now showing it to me as
if like, Ooh, how interesting.

596
00:37:53,370 --> 00:37:54,690
I was crazy here for a little bit.

597
00:37:56,070 --> 00:37:59,400
The truth is Oliver is fascinated
by what goes on in the human mind.

598
00:37:59,401 --> 00:38:01,080
No matter how strange it gets up there.

599
00:38:01,590 --> 00:38:05,130
At one time when he was a young
resident in California driving his bike.

600
00:38:05,130 --> 00:38:05,521
And by the way,

601
00:38:05,521 --> 00:38:09,750
I should show you what he looked like
back then when he was driving his bike.

602
00:38:09,751 --> 00:38:13,530
This I think is him in New
York, a kind of, you know,

603
00:38:15,990 --> 00:38:20,640
in the 60s he was also a champion
weightlifter. They called him Dr Squat.

604
00:38:20,940 --> 00:38:23,100
And in this picture that
you're showing you here,

605
00:38:23,310 --> 00:38:28,270
that's him raising 600 pounds in
order to win a trophy. Like this is a,

606
00:38:28,360 --> 00:38:29,370
he was a champ and,

607
00:38:29,640 --> 00:38:33,300
and you can see more pictures like these
cause we have signed copies of Oliver's

608
00:38:33,301 --> 00:38:36,610
new memoir out for sale in the lobby.
It's pretty good book too, by the way.

609
00:38:36,820 --> 00:38:38,980
So in any case at this time,

610
00:38:39,780 --> 00:38:43,180
and then 1960s in addition
to being all muscled out,

611
00:38:43,181 --> 00:38:47,830
Oliver was a serious recreational
drug taker. And because he's Oliver,

612
00:38:47,980 --> 00:38:51,790
he was extremely curious about his
highs and no matter how weird they were,

613
00:38:52,150 --> 00:38:56,770
one time, for example, he took 20
pills that he shouldn't have. And then

614
00:38:56,840 --> 00:39:00,680
to my surprise, um, uh,

615
00:39:00,710 --> 00:39:04,040
there was a spider on the
wall which said hello.

616
00:39:04,760 --> 00:39:08,040
It had a voice like Bertrand
Russell, the famous mathematician

617
00:39:08,180 --> 00:39:10,730
and the term it asked me a while,

618
00:39:10,731 --> 00:39:15,731
the technical question as to where the
Russell had exploded free egos paradox.

619
00:39:16,340 --> 00:39:19,020
And um, we had this conversation,

620
00:39:19,160 --> 00:39:23,270
you answered the spider a shoe I onto the
spine discussed fragrance paradox with

621
00:39:23,271 --> 00:39:27,770
this minor, I didn't deed cause you,
you trust your perceptions. Okay.

622
00:39:27,800 --> 00:39:32,800
Many years later when I mentioned this
to an entomologist fed at Cornell and the

623
00:39:33,261 --> 00:39:37,160
philosophical spiders said yes,
he said, I know the species.

624
00:39:39,410 --> 00:39:43,220
So thinking Oliver's way, taking
it all in, talking spiders,

625
00:39:43,221 --> 00:39:48,221
whatever the generosity of his
curiosity becomes profoundly moving and

626
00:39:48,411 --> 00:39:50,750
transformative when he's
treating his patients.

627
00:39:50,751 --> 00:39:54,320
I want to tell one story here really
quickly too, to demonstrate what I mean.

628
00:39:54,800 --> 00:39:57,950
I'll ever once had a patient
whom he called Mrs o c

629
00:39:59,510 --> 00:40:01,820
she was an old woman.

630
00:40:01,821 --> 00:40:05,810
She was 88 years old living in a nursing
home and one night she was awakened,

631
00:40:05,840 --> 00:40:07,550
jarred awake by a loud,

632
00:40:08,560 --> 00:40:09,630
I wish

633
00:40:13,050 --> 00:40:14,410
it was assault

634
00:40:17,240 --> 00:40:20,270
and she thought, well, somebody's left
the radio on. But when she looked,

635
00:40:20,690 --> 00:40:23,900
the radio in the room was off,
her roommate sound asleep,

636
00:40:23,901 --> 00:40:26,990
which was odd because
the song was really loud.

637
00:40:29,880 --> 00:40:32,360
[inaudible] after that
there was another song.

638
00:40:34,460 --> 00:40:34,540
Ah,

639
00:40:34,540 --> 00:40:35,680
and then another song

640
00:40:36,200 --> 00:40:37,120
who is at home

641
00:40:38,770 --> 00:40:39,610
misses Mrs. She thought, well,

642
00:40:39,670 --> 00:40:42,290
maybe my roommate can't hear
these songs because the songs are,

643
00:40:42,490 --> 00:40:46,000
are coming through the fillings in my
teeth. I've heard that's possible. But no,

644
00:40:46,001 --> 00:40:48,610
her doctors told her, this
is something in your head,

645
00:40:48,611 --> 00:40:52,990
you need to see a neurologist,
which led her to Dr Sachs.

646
00:40:54,830 --> 00:40:55,360
Yeah.

647
00:40:55,360 --> 00:40:58,160
At when he met Mrs he,
she could barely hear him.

648
00:40:58,161 --> 00:41:00,860
The song sung by the female
voice were coming and coming.

649
00:41:01,010 --> 00:41:04,130
She was frightened and justifiably
worried that she was going crazy.

650
00:41:04,340 --> 00:41:07,460
But Oliver said, no, no, no, I'm going
to do some tests. And when he was done,

651
00:41:07,790 --> 00:41:12,020
he said he'd found a slight stroke or
condition that had triggered musical

652
00:41:12,021 --> 00:41:14,570
epilepsy. These sudden
production of music in her brain.

653
00:41:15,230 --> 00:41:18,110
Now a normal doctor might say,
okay, we've got the diagnosis,

654
00:41:18,111 --> 00:41:20,900
and he thought that the songs would
probably fade and it will pass.

655
00:41:20,901 --> 00:41:25,070
So they would be done. But Oliver
did not stop. He doesn't stop

656
00:41:28,220 --> 00:41:28,390
[inaudible]

657
00:41:28,390 --> 00:41:29,560
he kept talking to her.

658
00:41:30,160 --> 00:41:35,160
She told him she was born in Ireland in
the 1890s her father died before she was

659
00:41:35,301 --> 00:41:37,640
born. Her mother, when she was only five

660
00:41:38,810 --> 00:41:43,500
often alone, she was sent to America to
live for the welder for beating maison.

661
00:41:44,080 --> 00:41:49,080
And she had no conscious memory at
the first five years of her life,

662
00:41:49,480 --> 00:41:51,880
no memory of her mother of Ireland.

663
00:41:52,170 --> 00:41:55,330
She had always felt this as
a key in and painful sadness,

664
00:41:55,540 --> 00:41:59,470
this lack or forgetting at the earliest,
those precious years of her life.

665
00:42:00,690 --> 00:42:05,240
So we asked her about the songs, what
are they like and Mrs. She said, well, I,

666
00:42:05,241 --> 00:42:08,880
I think they're lullabies. Can
you sing them for me? She did.

667
00:42:09,480 --> 00:42:10,500
And then after checking with,

668
00:42:10,560 --> 00:42:13,740
I'm not sure who al ever figured out
that these songs were happened to be

669
00:42:13,741 --> 00:42:18,720
popular Irish ballads from the 1890s
when Mrs OSI was a little baby.

670
00:42:19,050 --> 00:42:22,860
And that gave him an idea. Now
what he does next isn't science.

671
00:42:23,040 --> 00:42:25,290
It isn't in any traditional way medicine.

672
00:42:25,470 --> 00:42:28,200
He just told her a story
and it goes like this.

673
00:42:28,890 --> 00:42:31,770
You know how nobody remembers anything
that happens to you when you're one or

674
00:42:31,771 --> 00:42:35,580
two or three? Well, there was a
theory once, not honored much today,

675
00:42:35,581 --> 00:42:38,940
but it's sad that those earliest
memories get locked away,

676
00:42:38,941 --> 00:42:42,510
deepen our brains in a special
safe, and we can never open.

677
00:42:42,810 --> 00:42:47,760
So let's suppose Mrs Ossi, you're
stroked by some crazy chance,

678
00:42:48,240 --> 00:42:53,100
open the lock that none of us can break
and released those first memories in you

679
00:42:53,160 --> 00:42:56,910
just for a little while so that
the voice you're listening to

680
00:42:57,320 --> 00:43:01,430
there is a home
[inaudible] great. Then Mo,

681
00:43:02,700 --> 00:43:07,650
maybe that isn't a radio voice. Let's
thing that it's your mother's voice.

682
00:43:08,220 --> 00:43:09,210
That's your missing mother.

683
00:43:09,600 --> 00:43:13,230
And so at the ripe old age of 88 you
finally get to be back in your mother's

684
00:43:13,231 --> 00:43:18,150
arms. You get to be a baby again. And
Mrs OFI thought about that and said,

685
00:43:18,900 --> 00:43:19,733
okay,

686
00:43:20,120 --> 00:43:21,520
it sort of fits.

687
00:43:21,610 --> 00:43:25,330
I'm an old woman with a stroke
in an old people's home,

688
00:43:26,110 --> 00:43:31,060
but I feel I'm a child to Ireland. The
Gate, I feel my mother's arms. I see her,

689
00:43:31,270 --> 00:43:32,500
I hear her voice singing,

690
00:43:33,180 --> 00:43:35,430
the green it clean.

691
00:43:39,420 --> 00:43:40,253
[inaudible].

692
00:43:41,050 --> 00:43:44,530
Shortly thereafter, the songs
began to fade. The pauses widened.

693
00:43:44,920 --> 00:43:49,150
Mrs Ossi had been so frightened by this
music in her head was now sorry to see

694
00:43:49,151 --> 00:43:53,920
the songs go. But it was Oliver who
noticed how those songs had touched her,

695
00:43:54,040 --> 00:43:57,940
who noticed that the songs might become
a comfort to her because that's what he

696
00:43:57,941 --> 00:44:01,990
does. He listens closely, he
can hear another person's heart.

697
00:44:02,680 --> 00:44:07,570
And this is really the profound puzzle
for me of Oliver because reading the new

698
00:44:07,571 --> 00:44:08,291
autobiography,

699
00:44:08,291 --> 00:44:12,830
you see that while he was so full of
heart as a doctor in his own life and in

700
00:44:12,831 --> 00:44:14,890
the relationships that really mattered,

701
00:44:14,950 --> 00:44:18,970
it turns out he didn't get a whole lot
of affection. He was, for a long time,

702
00:44:18,971 --> 00:44:21,970
a lonely guy. I'd say he was very lonely.

703
00:44:22,420 --> 00:44:26,170
And he's talking about that
now for the first time. Let me,

704
00:44:26,260 --> 00:44:31,060
let me talk about love for a minute.
Um, in this book, you tell the story of,

705
00:44:31,500 --> 00:44:32,190
of your very

706
00:44:32,190 --> 00:44:35,010
first love a fellow by the
name of Richard Sell it.

707
00:44:36,270 --> 00:44:40,770
Can you just tell me what
happened with him? Um, yeah. Um,

708
00:44:40,800 --> 00:44:45,800
he was a road scholar at Oxford and I'm
a poet and handsome and beautiful beyond

709
00:44:47,791 --> 00:44:52,410
belief and I sort of fell for him. Um,

710
00:44:52,680 --> 00:44:56,480
although I didn't say
anything because I was, um,

711
00:44:57,690 --> 00:45:02,670
uh, very haunted by my mother's
accusations. But did your mother,

712
00:45:03,110 --> 00:45:03,360
um,

713
00:45:03,360 --> 00:45:08,360
well to go a couple of years back then
my father had opened the conversation

714
00:45:09,361 --> 00:45:12,060
that I was about to go to ops
for that and I've sort of father,

715
00:45:12,061 --> 00:45:15,020
son conversation and he said, um,

716
00:45:15,570 --> 00:45:19,950
you don't seem to have many
girlfriends. And I said, no,

717
00:45:20,640 --> 00:45:24,330
wishing the conversation
would stop. He said, um,

718
00:45:24,690 --> 00:45:29,040
something wrong with girls. And I
said, no, that they're fine taps,

719
00:45:29,041 --> 00:45:33,600
you prefer boys. And I said,
well, yes I do. I said,

720
00:45:33,601 --> 00:45:36,180
I've never done anything but I do.

721
00:45:37,470 --> 00:45:42,060
And then you knew that then I knew
that then I had known it for six years,

722
00:45:42,061 --> 00:45:45,810
probably since I was 12. Um, and I said,

723
00:45:45,990 --> 00:45:48,900
don't tell mom she will
be able to take it.

724
00:45:49,770 --> 00:45:54,770
But my father did tell my mother and
the night and the next morning she came

725
00:45:56,281 --> 00:45:57,210
down with them.

726
00:45:57,830 --> 00:46:02,160
I somehow wants to say a face
of Fonda and raged at me,

727
00:46:02,640 --> 00:46:05,700
and among other things
said, you're an abomination.

728
00:46:05,880 --> 00:46:07,320
I wish you would never been born.

729
00:46:08,040 --> 00:46:12,720
And then she suddenly shut up
and said nothing for three days.

730
00:46:13,410 --> 00:46:16,980
And um, uh,

731
00:46:17,970 --> 00:46:20,520
the matter was never mentioned
again in her lifetime.

732
00:46:21,810 --> 00:46:26,810
And then two years later I found myself
for the first time in my life falling in

733
00:46:26,881 --> 00:46:31,380
love. And this was the gun guy, Richard
Oliver at the time was in college.

734
00:46:31,500 --> 00:46:34,440
It was a very positive feeling where
I didn't know whether it was one,

735
00:46:34,441 --> 00:46:36,060
which I did express,

736
00:46:36,270 --> 00:46:40,520
but I did say so with my heart and my
mouth to each other. But what did you,

737
00:46:40,521 --> 00:46:42,930
you remember what you said? Uh, I said,

738
00:46:42,931 --> 00:46:47,931
I'm in love with you and we should
gripped me by the shoulders.

739
00:46:48,031 --> 00:46:51,870
And he said, I know. He
said, but I'm not that way,

740
00:46:52,230 --> 00:46:56,970
but I love you in my own way.
And I was glad I had said that.

741
00:46:57,070 --> 00:47:00,720
I'm glad that it had been received
in such a warm, friendly way.

742
00:47:00,721 --> 00:47:03,630
I thought we might be friends
for the rest of our lives,

743
00:47:03,930 --> 00:47:06,150
but then one day he came into me,

744
00:47:06,151 --> 00:47:11,151
he said he'd been bothered by finding
a lump in his groin and he was worried

745
00:47:11,820 --> 00:47:16,820
could I have a look at it and I looked
at it and I felt it and it was hard and

746
00:47:18,150 --> 00:47:23,150
tethered turned out to be a
particularly malignant form of lymphoid.

747
00:47:25,020 --> 00:47:30,020
Timo was called a lympho sarcoma and
he never spoke to me again after that.

748
00:47:31,510 --> 00:47:35,830
I don't know whether since I'd been the
first to recognize the ominous import,

749
00:47:35,860 --> 00:47:39,970
I don't know whether he saw me as a
harbinger of death or messenger of death,

750
00:47:40,280 --> 00:47:41,110
whatever.

751
00:47:41,110 --> 00:47:45,370
But you were left with the,
with that silence. Yeah. Yeah.

752
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:49,600
A few years later I'll ever met
and man named Mel, he was a young,

753
00:47:49,601 --> 00:47:52,520
he was a sailor like Oliver.
He was into weightlifting.

754
00:47:52,570 --> 00:47:55,210
They became close friends and
they began living together.

755
00:47:55,470 --> 00:48:00,470
I adored him and was in love with him
and loved physical contact with him

756
00:48:01,250 --> 00:48:04,970
and they'd work out and they'd wrestle
and ride motorcycles kind of tightly and

757
00:48:05,240 --> 00:48:08,060
they never talked about what might or
might not be happening between them.

758
00:48:08,061 --> 00:48:12,440
But one day they were together and
Oliver was giving mil a back massage,

759
00:48:12,441 --> 00:48:16,430
which mill often asked him to
do. And uh, I love doing that.

760
00:48:16,580 --> 00:48:19,520
And Oliver says sometimes
he'd get a little, you know,

761
00:48:19,700 --> 00:48:24,530
excited. And so long as I gave no
explicit indication it was okay,

762
00:48:24,890 --> 00:48:29,800
but, but, but one day things went a
bit too far and I got sort of, um,

763
00:48:29,870 --> 00:48:33,370
I went over the bridge instead
of just before the pink, um,

764
00:48:34,010 --> 00:48:38,750
mental immediately sort of got
up and had a shower and said, I,

765
00:48:38,920 --> 00:48:42,270
I can't stay with you anymore. And um,

766
00:48:42,350 --> 00:48:47,350
I found that very cruel and upsetting
and heartbreaking and it made me feel,

767
00:48:49,760 --> 00:48:54,620
I don't want to have anything to do
with people. I must have fallen in love.

768
00:48:54,890 --> 00:48:58,040
I cannot share life's with anyone again.

769
00:48:58,250 --> 00:49:01,850
And he didn't share his life with
anyone for a long, long time.

770
00:49:03,170 --> 00:49:04,040
In fact,

771
00:49:04,850 --> 00:49:09,850
he told me a story about something that
happened to him maybe eight years ago.

772
00:49:10,280 --> 00:49:10,550
I,

773
00:49:10,550 --> 00:49:15,360
I was just joining the faculty at Columbia
and I was having this one interview

774
00:49:15,510 --> 00:49:18,480
and one point the interviewer
said to me, she said,

775
00:49:18,481 --> 00:49:22,050
I have something rather private to
our school. We do like Ms Edgar,

776
00:49:22,290 --> 00:49:26,970
your assistant to leave. And I said,
no, she's privy to all my affairs.

777
00:49:27,240 --> 00:49:31,860
And I then set thinking she was
going to ask me about six. I said,

778
00:49:31,861 --> 00:49:36,840
I haven't had any sex for 35 years. I bet.

779
00:49:36,841 --> 00:49:39,190
In fact, when she was going
to ask me my social security,

780
00:49:43,460 --> 00:49:43,630
okay,

781
00:49:43,630 --> 00:49:47,730
and she burst into laughter. She
said, Oh, you poor thing. She said,

782
00:49:47,850 --> 00:49:50,640
we must do something about it. Well,

783
00:49:50,641 --> 00:49:54,070
the truth is Oliver didn't do anything
about it because he didn't think he

784
00:49:54,071 --> 00:49:58,180
could. I mean, he chosen, Richard
lost, Richard Chosen Mail, lost mail.

785
00:49:58,360 --> 00:50:00,910
It was the point he was
thinking. And then finally,

786
00:50:00,940 --> 00:50:03,790
and who knows when or why these
things happened to people.

787
00:50:04,360 --> 00:50:08,260
But a man came along who for
the first time chose Oliver.

788
00:50:09,890 --> 00:50:10,723
I have made met

789
00:50:10,900 --> 00:50:15,900
Billy is I meet a number of people because
I'd been sent a manuscript or proof

790
00:50:16,370 --> 00:50:20,260
for book and I'm an
intimacy group between us.

791
00:50:20,620 --> 00:50:23,620
I don't think I quite
realized how deep it was.

792
00:50:23,650 --> 00:50:27,980
But then there was a
particular episode Christmas

793
00:50:28,040 --> 00:50:33,040
of Oh nine when he came up and in s

794
00:50:33,320 --> 00:50:38,030
serious way, he has a
serious careful when he said,

795
00:50:38,031 --> 00:50:40,910
I I have conceived a deep love for you.

796
00:50:41,570 --> 00:50:46,040
I have conceived the deep love for
you. Yeah. Um, that isn't sort of,

797
00:50:46,740 --> 00:50:49,860
that's like a few extra
words I have concealed.

798
00:50:51,440 --> 00:50:55,790
Okay. Was He scared to
say I love you or um, no,

799
00:50:56,060 --> 00:51:00,230
she likes the English
language. I think it,

800
00:51:00,350 --> 00:51:02,650
I think it couldn't have been put, um,

801
00:51:02,840 --> 00:51:05,570
more cautiously and yet more strongly.

802
00:51:06,440 --> 00:51:08,720
I think it was a beautiful
way of putting it.

803
00:51:09,170 --> 00:51:13,940
And then I realized at that
moment with his saying that,

804
00:51:13,970 --> 00:51:18,970
that I had conceived a deep love
for him and I am among other things,

805
00:51:20,301 --> 00:51:23,360
I thought good has happened again,

806
00:51:27,450 --> 00:51:28,283
two

807
00:51:28,500 --> 00:51:33,090
and I'm in my 77th year. Um, and,

808
00:51:33,850 --> 00:51:38,800
and what next and things, um,

809
00:51:39,010 --> 00:51:41,470
basically have gone happily ever since.

810
00:51:47,530 --> 00:51:47,870
[inaudible]

811
00:51:47,870 --> 00:51:51,460
and surprisingly look Lesley. Um,

812
00:51:52,340 --> 00:51:56,810
because then again I'm not dealing
with a, what I'm dealing with a hoop,

813
00:51:57,530 --> 00:52:02,510
I'm dealing with an individual. I,

814
00:52:02,830 --> 00:52:05,330
I'm not dealing with a um, uh,

815
00:52:06,530 --> 00:52:09,460
well a condition defined
by medicine or law.

816
00:52:10,900 --> 00:52:14,620
So Oliver's still doesn't know how much
time he has left. But for the moment,

817
00:52:14,621 --> 00:52:18,400
as you can hear, his mind is
totally intact. He's still writing.

818
00:52:18,401 --> 00:52:21,670
He has two books in addition to the
one you'll find in the lobby that he's

819
00:52:21,671 --> 00:52:23,560
writing and the children's book,

820
00:52:23,650 --> 00:52:27,130
bunch of New Yorkers stories in the
last few months and a New York Review of

821
00:52:27,360 --> 00:52:29,260
book story. He's got energy to spare.

822
00:52:29,261 --> 00:52:31,330
So I want to do one last
thing before we close.

823
00:52:32,320 --> 00:52:35,290
And this comes from yet
another conversation I had
with him and it's a story I

824
00:52:35,291 --> 00:52:39,340
know Oliver would hate because he's not
a capital I or religious kind of guy,

825
00:52:39,640 --> 00:52:43,030
but he is somebody who
definitely embraces mystery.

826
00:52:43,031 --> 00:52:48,031
And for a long time he's been
mystified by a color called Indigo,

827
00:52:48,430 --> 00:52:49,263
indigo,

828
00:52:49,600 --> 00:52:53,650
which Newton had inserted
between blue and violet.

829
00:52:54,070 --> 00:52:58,510
And no, no two people seem to
agree as to what indigo was like.

830
00:52:59,200 --> 00:53:03,730
And so I built up a sort
of chemical launchpad,

831
00:53:03,760 --> 00:53:05,100
meaning he took a lot of

832
00:53:07,360 --> 00:53:12,360
base of amphetamine from general arouse
or then some acid and a little cannabis.

833
00:53:13,030 --> 00:53:16,630
And when I was sufficiently
stoned, I said,

834
00:53:16,631 --> 00:53:19,710
I want to see indigo now

835
00:53:23,980 --> 00:53:26,730
as if it were reply and does.

836
00:53:26,950 --> 00:53:31,770
It's fallen by a giant paintbrush
that appeared a huge trembling,

837
00:53:32,190 --> 00:53:37,190
pear shaped blob of what I instantly
realized was pure indigo on the white wall

838
00:53:39,570 --> 00:53:40,410
in front of me.

839
00:53:41,370 --> 00:53:46,370
It had had a wonderful luminosity
and in particular I am,

840
00:53:46,590 --> 00:53:51,190
although I'm not a religious person,
I thought this is the color of heaven

841
00:53:52,890 --> 00:53:55,560
and I live towards it
and the sort of ecstasy

842
00:53:56,650 --> 00:54:00,850
and then suddenly disappeared and he
says he had one more moment like that.

843
00:54:00,851 --> 00:54:04,850
This time, no drugs. He was in a
museum staring at an Egyptian artifact.

844
00:54:04,851 --> 00:54:08,410
He sees this Ri and color
back again just for a beat.

845
00:54:08,510 --> 00:54:13,220
I was given five tantalizing
seconds of, of, of radiant,

846
00:54:13,250 --> 00:54:14,120
ineffable

847
00:54:14,740 --> 00:54:16,660
ut, and then again it vanished.

848
00:54:16,870 --> 00:54:21,400
And that was in 1965 and I
have never seen indigo since.

849
00:54:21,670 --> 00:54:23,020
But who knows? You know,

850
00:54:23,470 --> 00:54:28,470
someday I like to think Dr Sachs
may get to see that color again.
