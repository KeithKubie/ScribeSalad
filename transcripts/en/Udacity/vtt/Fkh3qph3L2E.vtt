00:00:00.510 --> 00:00:03.940
Let's add delegation to the record
sounds view controller.

00:00:03.940 --> 00:00:07.950
First we have to tell Xcode that our
record sounds view controller conforms

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:10.390
to the AVAudioRecorder
delegate protocol.

00:00:11.410 --> 00:00:11.920
That is to say.

00:00:11.920 --> 00:00:15.450
we'll implementing a function described
in that delegate protocol, and

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:18.718
our view controller can act as
the delegate for AVAudioRecorder.

00:00:18.718 --> 00:00:24.640
And the RecordSoundsViewController.swift
file, go to the class declaration and

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:28.100
indicate that we conform to
the AV audio recorder delegate,

00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:31.630
by adding it here after
UIViewController.

00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:35.270
A class in Swift can only inherit
from a single superclass, but

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:38.080
it can conform to as many
protocols as you want.

00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:40.410
You just have to list them
here separated by a comma.

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:43.280
Next we have to tell the a.v.

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:47.170
audio recorder that the record sound
view controller can act as its delegate.

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:51.480
In the record audio function we
can set our view controller self

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:52.610
as a delegate to the a.v.

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:54.410
Audio recorder with this line.

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:58.250
Scroll down to the bottom of the record
sounds view controller.swift file.

00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:01.110
Because we've already informed Xcode.

00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:04.110
That our record sounds view
controller conforms to

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:05.790
the AVAudioRecorder delegate.

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:07.420
If we start typing.

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:10.670
We can see that Xcode autocomplete
automatically shows us.

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:14.510
The functions available in
the AVAudioRecorder delegate.

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:17.660
Including AudioRecorder
did finish recording.

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:20.850
If you hit the return key, Xcode
will fill this function out for us.

00:01:21.910 --> 00:01:26.130
This is the function we're going to use
to call the stop recording segue that

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:29.820
we set up earlier, and
move to the audio playback scene.

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:32.350
For now let's just add a print
statement to let us know when

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:35.340
AV audio recorder is finished,
right here where it says code.
