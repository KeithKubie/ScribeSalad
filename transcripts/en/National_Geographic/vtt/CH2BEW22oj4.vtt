00:00:00.433 --> 00:00:04.571
( intro music )

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:14.314 line:0%
( applause )

00:00:14.314 --> 00:00:15.547 line:0%
Good morning.

00:00:15.547 --> 00:00:18.584 line:0%
It has been a truly
exciting week for me.

00:00:18.584 --> 00:00:20.786 line:0%
It's a very empowering
experience for me

00:00:20.786 --> 00:00:23.623 line:0%
to get to know my fellow
emerging explorers.

00:00:23.623 --> 00:00:27.193
For me, I'm passionate
about energy problems.

00:00:27.193 --> 00:00:28.561
I hope we can have

00:00:28.561 --> 00:00:31.264
a sustainable energy future.

00:00:31.264 --> 00:00:34.099
Growing up in China,
in the period

00:00:34.099 --> 00:00:36.769
that the cultural revolution
was in the past,

00:00:36.769 --> 00:00:39.606
China has opened up
its doors to look for

00:00:39.606 --> 00:00:42.041
better economy
and better lives.

00:00:42.041 --> 00:00:45.411
Our lives are getting
better and better,

00:00:45.411 --> 00:00:48.414
but energy is always scarce.

00:00:48.414 --> 00:00:50.883
I remember I used
to watch my Mom

00:00:50.883 --> 00:00:53.686
working in the kitchen
under very dim light

00:00:53.686 --> 00:00:56.356
trying to save electricity.

00:00:56.356 --> 00:00:58.524
About 10 years ago,
my parents bought

00:00:58.524 --> 00:01:00.460
a solar thermal system.

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:03.229
Like many city people,
they live in apartments,

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:04.897
those high-rise buildings.

00:01:04.897 --> 00:01:06.432
They installed a solar system

00:01:06.432 --> 00:01:08.901
on the rooftop of
their building.

00:01:08.901 --> 00:01:12.271
Such a system will heat
up their domestic water

00:01:12.271 --> 00:01:14.506
so they can have
access to hot water,

00:01:14.506 --> 00:01:16.242
and that makes a huge difference

00:01:16.242 --> 00:01:18.077
for their life quality.

00:01:18.077 --> 00:01:20.079
Like many families, they want to

00:01:20.079 --> 00:01:22.614
install such systems
on the rooftop

00:01:22.614 --> 00:01:24.316
and it becomes a competition.

00:01:24.316 --> 00:01:27.286
Everyone wants a space there.

00:01:27.286 --> 00:01:28.888
One day my father said,

00:01:28.888 --> 00:01:31.090
"It will be really nice,
we can hang

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:34.727
solar thermal panels
outside our window,

00:01:34.727 --> 00:01:37.329
the piping will be
simpler, and everyone

00:01:37.329 --> 00:01:40.300
will have access to
the renewable energy."

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:43.236
That makes me think
about there really

00:01:43.236 --> 00:01:45.404
is a strong need
for this kind of

00:01:45.404 --> 00:01:49.042
flexible and lightweight
solar systems.

00:01:49.042 --> 00:01:51.878
That motivates me
to develop later on

00:01:51.878 --> 00:01:54.947
the solar cell stickers,
and this work is done

00:01:54.947 --> 00:01:58.217
by my students and me
at Stanford University.

00:01:58.217 --> 00:02:01.287
The solar stickers
are like downside

00:02:01.287 --> 00:02:02.956
just like the stickers
your kids put on

00:02:02.956 --> 00:02:04.524
your clothes to say,

00:02:04.524 --> 00:02:07.259
'Thank you, Mom,'
'Good job, Mom.'

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:08.460
( laughter )

00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:10.696
You peel them off
and then stick it

00:02:10.696 --> 00:02:14.033
to anywhere you want,
so that we can increase

00:02:14.033 --> 00:02:17.070
the places we can
use solar energy.

00:02:18.037 --> 00:02:19.572
The reason I'm interested in

00:02:19.572 --> 00:02:21.741
solar energy is very simple.

00:02:21.741 --> 00:02:25.811
There is abundant
resources of solar energy.

00:02:25.811 --> 00:02:30.583 line:0%
Here we show
the world's energy resources.

00:02:30.583 --> 00:02:32.618 line:0%
The big one in the center is

00:02:32.618 --> 00:02:35.287 line:0%
the annual energy from the sun.

00:02:35.287 --> 00:02:37.556 line:0%
The ones on the right-hand side

00:02:37.556 --> 00:02:39.959 line:0%
are from the finite resources.

00:02:39.959 --> 00:02:42.228 line:0%
For example, the petroleum,

00:02:42.228 --> 00:02:45.097 line:0%
coal, natural gas, etc.

00:02:45.097 --> 00:02:46.933 line:0%
The small circles in the center

00:02:46.933 --> 00:02:49.135 line:0%
represent those
renewable sources,

00:02:49.135 --> 00:02:51.037 line:0%
their annual energy output,

00:02:51.037 --> 00:02:54.139 line:0%
for example, wind,
geothermal, etc.

00:02:54.139 --> 00:02:57.743 line:0%
The two blue dots on
the very left-hand side

00:02:57.743 --> 00:03:00.979 line:0%
represent our annual
consumption of energy.

00:03:00.979 --> 00:03:02.782 line:0%
The smaller one is about energy

00:03:02.782 --> 00:03:04.883 line:0%
consumption in 2010.

00:03:04.883 --> 00:03:06.151 line:0%
The bigger one is

00:03:06.151 --> 00:03:09.722 line:0%
the estimated energy consumption
in 2015.

00:03:09.722 --> 00:03:13.392
You can see our
energy consumption is increasing

00:03:13.392 --> 00:03:17.029
as we want to preserve
our lifestyle

00:03:17.029 --> 00:03:18.864
and people from
developing countries

00:03:18.864 --> 00:03:21.267
are looking for
better life quality.

00:03:21.267 --> 00:03:24.470
If we continue to
rely on fossil fuels,

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:27.006
we are going to
deplete them one day,

00:03:27.006 --> 00:03:29.742
sooner or later,
because we are using them

00:03:29.742 --> 00:03:33.178
simply at a rate much faster
than can be regenerated.

00:03:33.178 --> 00:03:35.848
We have to rely more and more

00:03:35.848 --> 00:03:37.416
on renewable energy

00:03:37.416 --> 00:03:39.918
and solar is a
wonderful resource.

00:03:39.918 --> 00:03:42.054
We are using solar energy now.

00:03:42.054 --> 00:03:45.291
We are using it
in the form of solar panels.

00:03:45.291 --> 00:03:47.593
You probably all have
seen this kind of

00:03:47.593 --> 00:03:49.495
flat panel looking thing,

00:03:49.495 --> 00:03:52.097
dark color, facing the sun.

00:03:52.097 --> 00:03:54.700
Those solar panels
essentially

00:03:54.700 --> 00:03:57.035
is a sun-powered battery.

00:03:57.035 --> 00:03:59.872
When the sun illuminates
those solar panels,

00:03:59.872 --> 00:04:02.375
they will generate
electron holes.

00:04:02.375 --> 00:04:04.143
The flow of
electrons in the holes

00:04:04.143 --> 00:04:06.846
will generate current
and that current

00:04:06.846 --> 00:04:08.514
powers the electrical load.

00:04:08.514 --> 00:04:11.917
For example, your
phones, a lamp, etc.

00:04:11.917 --> 00:04:14.086
You can think
about the solar cell

00:04:14.086 --> 00:04:18.658
as a sun-powered battery
constantly charged by sunlight.

00:04:18.658 --> 00:04:21.995
If we look a little deeper
into the solar cells,

00:04:21.995 --> 00:04:24.963
a solar cell just like
a battery, as I mentioned,

00:04:24.963 --> 00:04:26.932
as all batteries you will have

00:04:26.932 --> 00:04:30.336
a positive and a negative side.

00:04:30.336 --> 00:04:33.272
The greyish color
on the top and the bottom

00:04:33.272 --> 00:04:35.074
are the positive
and negative part.

00:04:35.074 --> 00:04:37.276
They are metallic layers.

00:04:37.276 --> 00:04:39.745
What's in between
is semiconductor,

00:04:39.745 --> 00:04:43.082
frequently silicon,
that can absorb sunlight

00:04:43.082 --> 00:04:45.151
and generate electron hole

00:04:45.151 --> 00:04:47.487
that drives the current.

00:04:47.487 --> 00:04:50.789
You can think about from
the structure perspective,

00:04:50.789 --> 00:04:53.559
this solar cell looks
like a sandwich.

00:04:55.094 --> 00:04:56.862
It's the semiconductor
sandwiched

00:04:56.862 --> 00:04:58.798
between two electrodes.

00:04:58.798 --> 00:05:02.367
If this whole thing is as thin
as one type of solar cell

00:05:02.367 --> 00:05:04.003
called a thin film solar cell,

00:05:04.003 --> 00:05:05.904
then it has the potential

00:05:05.904 --> 00:05:10.309
to become
flexible and lightweight.

00:05:10.309 --> 00:05:11.810
If we look at the key parameters

00:05:11.810 --> 00:05:13.546
we characterize solar cell,

00:05:13.546 --> 00:05:16.081
the one parameter
is called efficiency.

00:05:16.081 --> 00:05:18.551
How much power can
be generated

00:05:18.551 --> 00:05:22.454
comparing to how much power
is incident by sunlight?

00:05:22.454 --> 00:05:26.825
In other words, what
percentage of sun power

00:05:26.825 --> 00:05:29.161
you can convert to electricity?

00:05:29.161 --> 00:05:31.964
For most solar cells
in the market,

00:05:31.964 --> 00:05:34.300
it's about 10 to 20 percent.

00:05:34.300 --> 00:05:38.337
For example, if we have
15 percent solar panels,

00:05:38.337 --> 00:05:41.440
if you have one square
centimeter area,

00:05:41.440 --> 00:05:44.209
you can generate
about 150 watts.

00:05:44.209 --> 00:05:46.845
That's enough to power
two to three lamps.

00:05:46.845 --> 00:05:49.349
If I have a rock
the size of this rug,

00:05:49.349 --> 00:05:52.685
it will probably roughly
generate about 500 watts.

00:05:52.685 --> 00:05:54.320
That's the magnitude.

00:05:54.320 --> 00:05:57.589
To increase the energy
production by solar cells,

00:05:57.589 --> 00:05:59.592
one is to increase efficiency;

00:05:59.592 --> 00:06:02.428
the other to increase the area
you want to use it.

00:06:02.428 --> 00:06:04.830
We want to make them
to be able

00:06:04.830 --> 00:06:07.800
to apply it
not only on rooftops.

00:06:07.800 --> 00:06:10.502
For example, these are
the rooftop solar panels

00:06:10.502 --> 00:06:13.238
at Stanford, that's over
the Business Center,

00:06:13.238 --> 00:06:16.776
and those are great
for rooftop applications.

00:06:16.776 --> 00:06:19.512
But as I mentioned,
we want to increase the places.

00:06:19.512 --> 00:06:22.247
There's only limited
space on rooftops.

00:06:22.247 --> 00:06:25.417
It will be nice
if we can put on cars,

00:06:25.417 --> 00:06:27.452
or maybe on the side
walls of buildings,

00:06:27.452 --> 00:06:29.989
then those solar cells
have to be flexible.

00:06:29.989 --> 00:06:32.358
What's the challenge?

00:06:32.358 --> 00:06:35.061 line:0%
This is how solar
cell looks like,

00:06:35.061 --> 00:06:37.930 line:0%
called the thin-film
solar cells.

00:06:37.930 --> 00:06:40.833 line:0%
The bluish color
is the sandwich structure,

00:06:40.833 --> 00:06:42.201 line:0%
that's the solar cell

00:06:42.201 --> 00:06:45.404 line:0%
that's the actual part
that generates electricity.

00:06:45.404 --> 00:06:47.439 line:0%
Those things have
to be manufactured

00:06:47.439 --> 00:06:48.641 line:0%
on the substrate.

00:06:48.641 --> 00:06:50.476 line:0%
The substrate is
the holder for them.

00:06:50.476 --> 00:06:54.480
The substrate
typically is glass

00:06:54.480 --> 00:06:56.749
or silicon wafer
or stainless steel.

00:06:56.749 --> 00:07:00.318
The solar cell part is
only a couple microns,

00:07:00.318 --> 00:07:03.189
about one-tenth of the thickness

00:07:03.189 --> 00:07:05.090
of the plastic food wrap
you use.

00:07:05.090 --> 00:07:07.559
That's very thin, very flexible.

00:07:07.559 --> 00:07:10.095
But the substrate
is about a millimeter scale.

00:07:10.095 --> 00:07:12.297
It's about a thousand
times thicker.

00:07:12.297 --> 00:07:15.134
That's the part that
causes the solar cells

00:07:15.134 --> 00:07:17.636
to be heavy, to be rigid.

00:07:17.636 --> 00:07:20.172
But we need those
substrates as a holder

00:07:20.172 --> 00:07:21.941
to fabricate the material.

00:07:21.941 --> 00:07:24.410
During the fabrication,
they put the substrate there

00:07:24.410 --> 00:07:26.378
and they deposit material
on top.

00:07:26.378 --> 00:07:29.582
It's similar as the process
as ladies doing make-up,

00:07:29.582 --> 00:07:31.517
we have the face
as the substrate,

00:07:31.517 --> 00:07:33.886
we put layers and
layers of materials

00:07:33.886 --> 00:07:35.520
and they are very thin,

00:07:35.520 --> 00:07:37.924
so they don't show up very much.

00:07:39.292 --> 00:07:41.927
The idea here is
if we can replace

00:07:41.927 --> 00:07:44.896
the rigid substrate
by something flexible,

00:07:44.896 --> 00:07:47.266
for example, paper or plastic,

00:07:47.266 --> 00:07:50.869
then essentially we can
have a flexible substrate.

00:07:50.869 --> 00:07:53.606
But we cannot directly
just stick the paper

00:07:53.606 --> 00:07:55.808
into the solar
cell manufacturers.

00:07:55.808 --> 00:07:57.476
They cannot sustain
the environment,

00:07:57.476 --> 00:07:59.478
the temperature, the chemicals.

00:07:59.478 --> 00:08:02.748
We are required to
manufacture solar cells.

00:08:02.748 --> 00:08:04.350
So what do we do?

00:08:05.717 --> 00:08:08.086 line:0%
It's the inspiration from food.

00:08:08.086 --> 00:08:09.221 line:0%
( laughter )

00:08:09.221 --> 00:08:12.224 line:0%
It's the pizza approach.

00:08:12.224 --> 00:08:14.026
When we bake the pizza,

00:08:14.026 --> 00:08:17.396
we put this pizza
in a ceramic pan.

00:08:17.396 --> 00:08:20.799
The ceramic pan can sustain the
high temperature in your oven

00:08:20.799 --> 00:08:22.567
to cook the pizza.

00:08:22.567 --> 00:08:24.470
But when we deliver the pizza,

00:08:24.470 --> 00:08:26.638
we transfer that pizza out,

00:08:26.638 --> 00:08:28.307
put it in the paper box.

00:08:28.307 --> 00:08:31.009
That's much cheaper
so we can have pizza

00:08:31.009 --> 00:08:34.346
at a very economical price.

00:08:34.346 --> 00:08:35.181
( laughter )

00:08:35.181 --> 00:08:36.815
When we look at the pizza,

00:08:36.815 --> 00:08:38.617
essentially we have two carriers

00:08:38.617 --> 00:08:40.652
for two different functions.

00:08:40.652 --> 00:08:44.290
The pan is for the
high temperature
manufacturing process,

00:08:44.290 --> 00:08:48.193
and the paper is for
the delivery and
transportation purpose.

00:08:48.193 --> 00:08:50.963
We can do the same
thing for solar cells.

00:08:50.963 --> 00:08:53.232
This is how we do it.

00:08:53.232 --> 00:08:56.535
This is again the two-layer
structure I showed you.

00:08:56.535 --> 00:08:59.604
The blue is the solar
cell and the bottom

00:08:59.604 --> 00:09:03.042
is the thick glass
or silicon wafers.

00:09:03.042 --> 00:09:04.610
What we do differently

00:09:04.610 --> 00:09:07.780 line:0%
is we insert
a metallic layer in between,

00:09:07.780 --> 00:09:09.548 line:0%
and that layer serves

00:09:09.548 --> 00:09:12.451 line:0%
as a sacrificial layer later on.

00:09:12.451 --> 00:09:14.720 line:0%
The solar cells will
be manufactured

00:09:14.720 --> 00:09:17.556 line:0%
as identical procedures
and conditions

00:09:17.556 --> 00:09:20.559 line:0%
as your regular
thin-film solar cells.

00:09:20.559 --> 00:09:24.296 line:0%
What we do next
is we soak it in water.

00:09:24.296 --> 00:09:27.833 line:0%
Room temperature water,
just the tap water,

00:09:27.833 --> 00:09:31.170 line:0%
and inside water
we just peel it.

00:09:31.170 --> 00:09:33.739 line:0%
During this peeling process,

00:09:33.739 --> 00:09:38.744 line:0%
the metallic layer separates
from the substrate, the glass.

00:09:38.744 --> 00:09:42.113 line:0%
Now we have this thin
solar cell coming out,

00:09:42.113 --> 00:09:45.918
kind of like when ladies
apply the face mask.

00:09:45.918 --> 00:09:48.420
Sometimes you paint
it and when you remove it,

00:09:48.420 --> 00:09:50.422
it comes off as entire layer.

00:09:50.422 --> 00:09:54.827
It's the same thing
but we have water there.

00:09:54.827 --> 00:09:57.696
Now the thin solar cells,
as I mentioned,

00:09:57.696 --> 00:09:59.264
is only a couple microns.

00:09:59.264 --> 00:10:01.400
It's very thin
and you can stick it

00:10:01.400 --> 00:10:04.870
like a sticker to the back
of your cell phones.

00:10:04.870 --> 00:10:07.906
That realizes
the transfer process.

00:10:07.906 --> 00:10:09.575
Now we have two substrates.

00:10:09.575 --> 00:10:11.210
One for fabrication,

00:10:11.210 --> 00:10:14.379
one as the carrier
when you use it.

00:10:14.379 --> 00:10:16.148
The magical part to me

00:10:16.148 --> 00:10:18.450
is really
what happens in the water,

00:10:18.450 --> 00:10:21.019
and that is where
we have worked on.

00:10:21.019 --> 00:10:24.390 line:0%
This shows the process in water.

00:10:24.390 --> 00:10:26.692 line:0%
What you have
is a four-inch wafer

00:10:26.692 --> 00:10:28.994 line:0%
with the metallic layer
on silicon.

00:10:28.994 --> 00:10:31.263 line:0%
My students are
just working through the edges,

00:10:31.263 --> 00:10:33.766 line:0%
trying to make sure
the edges are clean.

00:10:36.468 --> 00:10:39.337
You can see in the initial
one-half minute,

00:10:39.337 --> 00:10:41.573
he's just working
through the edges,

00:10:41.573 --> 00:10:44.242
and then only within
a few seconds,

00:10:44.242 --> 00:10:46.144
he peeled off the entire thing.

00:10:46.144 --> 00:10:49.381 line:0%
What you see in the
front is the silicon wafer

00:10:49.381 --> 00:10:52.384 line:0%
that you can use for
the fabrication of solar cells.

00:10:52.384 --> 00:10:54.319 line:0%
You can see, after this process,

00:10:54.319 --> 00:10:56.454 line:0%
it's very clean so
you can use it again,

00:10:56.454 --> 00:10:58.156 line:0%
just like the pans for pizza,

00:10:58.156 --> 00:11:00.259 line:0%
for solar cell fabrications.

00:11:00.259 --> 00:11:02.060 line:0%
The one on the back,
the shiny part,

00:11:02.060 --> 00:11:04.964 line:0%
is the metallic layer
and the solar cells

00:11:04.964 --> 00:11:06.498 line:0%
come in behind that.

00:11:06.498 --> 00:11:08.867 line:0%
Now you have
a solar cell sticker.

00:11:08.867 --> 00:11:11.369
You can stick it to anywhere.

00:11:11.369 --> 00:11:13.405
This process only requires water

00:11:13.405 --> 00:11:14.640
and is really fast.

00:11:14.640 --> 00:11:17.709
You can see this takes
less than two minutes.

00:11:17.709 --> 00:11:21.280
We collaborated with National
Renewable Energy Lab.

00:11:21.280 --> 00:11:24.149
They fabricated this
amorphous silicon solar cell

00:11:24.149 --> 00:11:26.919
on our modified silicon wafers.

00:11:26.919 --> 00:11:29.421
Those circles
are the solar cells.

00:11:29.421 --> 00:11:31.289
After this peel-off process,

00:11:31.289 --> 00:11:34.960
we attached it to
my business card.

00:11:34.960 --> 00:11:37.162
It's very flexible.

00:11:37.162 --> 00:11:39.198
This is the initial
silicon wafer

00:11:39.198 --> 00:11:40.532
and it's very clean.

00:11:40.532 --> 00:11:41.967
You can use it again.

00:11:41.967 --> 00:11:44.870
The key parameter for
solar cell is efficiency.

00:11:44.870 --> 00:11:46.871
After this transfer process,

00:11:46.871 --> 00:11:49.107
the efficiency remains the same.

00:11:49.107 --> 00:11:50.709
That means the process
is so gentle,

00:11:50.709 --> 00:11:52.812
it doesn't damage
the solar cell.

00:11:52.812 --> 00:11:54.480
That's the key.

00:11:54.480 --> 00:11:57.682
This peel technology,
we think

00:11:57.682 --> 00:11:59.518
can really go beyond solar cell.

00:11:59.518 --> 00:12:01.219
It really doesn't depend
on the solar cell.

00:12:01.219 --> 00:12:03.421
We are just controlling
the interface.

00:12:03.421 --> 00:12:05.424
If you replace the solar cells

00:12:05.424 --> 00:12:10.261
with thin-film electronics,
for example, display.

00:12:10.261 --> 00:12:13.298
We can have flexible
displays, or batteries.

00:12:13.298 --> 00:12:15.467
We can have thin-film batteries,

00:12:15.467 --> 00:12:19.838
or sensors for human
health monitoring

00:12:19.838 --> 00:12:21.640
or environmental monitoring,

00:12:21.640 --> 00:12:24.210
or any other thin-film
electronic devices

00:12:24.210 --> 00:12:25.744
you can imagine.

00:12:25.744 --> 00:12:27.646
It is a very powerful technique

00:12:27.646 --> 00:12:30.182
for flexible electronics.

00:12:30.182 --> 00:12:34.352
With this technique,
I dream one day

00:12:34.352 --> 00:12:36.922
we can stick those
solar cells

00:12:36.922 --> 00:12:38.990
to the side wall
of the buildings,

00:12:38.990 --> 00:12:41.092
to the shade of your windows,

00:12:41.092 --> 00:12:43.628
to your helmet,
to the back of your phones,

00:12:43.628 --> 00:12:46.398
your iPad, to your backpack.

00:12:46.398 --> 00:12:48.567
With that, we can
power the world,

00:12:48.567 --> 00:12:50.568
and with that,
we can contribute

00:12:50.568 --> 00:12:52.571
to a sustainable energy future.

00:12:52.571 --> 00:12:53.805
Thank you very much.

00:12:53.805 --> 00:12:56.142
( applause )

00:12:56.142 --> 00:12:58.811
( outro music )
