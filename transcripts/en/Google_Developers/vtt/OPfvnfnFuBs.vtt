MATT MCNEILL: Hi everyone.

00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:03.080
I'm Matt.

00:00:03.080 --> 00:00:04.260
This is Tom.

00:00:04.260 --> 00:00:09.050
Welcome to the session, Here
Be BigQuery at I/O. Just

00:00:09.050 --> 00:00:12.070
before I start, I've got a bit
of a confession to make.

00:00:12.070 --> 00:00:14.650
I developed a bit of
an addiction over

00:00:14.650 --> 00:00:16.360
the last six months.

00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:21.600
It started back in November, and
someone internally sent me

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:25.850
an email with an invitation
to "join the resistance."

00:00:25.850 --> 00:00:27.515
For anyone who's played Ingress,
you all know what

00:00:27.515 --> 00:00:28.200
that means.

00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:31.180
I've gone through about
two pairs of shoes.

00:00:31.180 --> 00:00:33.410
I've walked more miles in the
last six months than I think

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:35.380
I've walked in the
last six years.

00:00:35.380 --> 00:00:38.660
It's been a really interesting
experience, because it's

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:42.750
probably been one of the most
engaging, social, fun sort of

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:45.430
games I've played in years.

00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:49.950
And I've been working a lot over
the last few months, few

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:53.110
years, in social gaming,
particularly working with some

00:00:53.110 --> 00:00:56.000
big gaming customers
in Europe, Gamesys

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:57.190
being one of them.

00:00:57.190 --> 00:01:01.310
And it really got me thinking,
how do you create that sort of

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:04.150
level of engagement in a game?

00:01:04.150 --> 00:01:05.820
You look at a game
like Ingress--

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:09.380
how do you get that level
of addiction in a game?

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:13.250
So when I started looking at
this, you see these statistics

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:15.410
that actually have been around
for a couple of years.

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:18.950
But so many games that
developers are building, they

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:22.200
get installed once, and then
they're never played again.

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:25.070
Something like 25%.

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:28.590
And if you're writing a game,
the finances associated with

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:30.630
these-- the real business
of a game--

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:31.940
is difficult.

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:36.030
An average game life cycle can
range between weeks and

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:38.640
months, but let's say
five or six weeks.

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:40.970
When you're planning your
business, that's when you're

00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:42.870
going to try to make
the money.

00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:45.950
But if you can crack this
engagement problem, you can

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:49.450
start pushing out beyond that,
and everything that comes

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:51.490
after that is profit.

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:53.190
And that's important when you're
really in the business

00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:55.090
of casual gaming.

00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:58.730
So I started thinking about what
are some of the drivers

00:01:58.730 --> 00:01:59.450
around this.

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:01.820
And one of the big trends
that I've seen come up--

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:04.750
and this is some basic research
I did on Google

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:08.180
Trends-- was there's a big trend
coming up around social

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:11.160
gaming and the connected game.

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:14.170
Of course, if you don't have
a connected game, it's very

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:17.000
difficult to actually
make it social.

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:20.930
A game back end enables that
social dimension to a game.

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:22.800
Ingress is a good example,
of course, in

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:23.830
quite an extreme way.

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:25.590
Though there's some other
drivers that came

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:27.630
out as well for that.

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:30.450
Second was-- this surprised me,
actually-- but a lot of

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:33.220
people are starting to create
connected games to push some

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:37.240
of their game logic out of the
client for piracy issues.

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:41.530
So there's a great story in
the press a few weeks ago,

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:45.050
where someone had built
a game simulation--

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:48.530
a simulation game of
a game company.

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:50.970
And what they were able to do
is detect whether the client

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:52.860
had been pirated or not.

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:55.770
And they played a bit of a
joke, and made sure that

00:02:55.770 --> 00:02:59.060
anyone who'd pirated the game,
their company went bust.

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:01.940
The virtual company went bust
because of pirates.

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:05.110
And there were all these forums
online where people

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:06.630
were, oh my god, this
game's awful!

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:09.120
I keep getting done
by pirates!

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:10.380
Yes.

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:11.420
It was great.

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:12.990
And this is the sort
of fun that people

00:03:12.990 --> 00:03:14.270
are starting to have.

00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:16.800
But I think probably one of
the most important areas,

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:18.565
actually, comes out
of measurement.

00:03:18.565 --> 00:03:21.390
If you've got a connected game,
you can start measuring

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:25.220
in a way that really has not
been possible before.

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:28.690
And I think one of the reasons
I was really keen on doing

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:32.130
this session is I think some of
the work that Tom's done in

00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:35.140
Gamesys is some of the most
advanced work I've seen in

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:40.160
really developing this idea of
a science of engagement,

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:43.550
retention, and keeping those
users playing the game.

00:03:43.550 --> 00:03:46.115
So I'm going to hand over at
this point, Tom Newton,

00:03:46.115 --> 00:03:48.282
Director of Social
Gaming, Gamesys.

00:03:48.282 --> 00:03:49.532
TOM NEWTON: Thanks, Matt.

00:03:52.855 --> 00:03:54.530
Hi, everyone.

00:03:54.530 --> 00:03:58.440
So as Matt's just introduced me,
my name's Tom Newton, and

00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:00.960
I'm a director at Gamesys, and
I look after our social and

00:04:00.960 --> 00:04:03.090
mobile games business.

00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:07.430
So many of you probably have
never heard of Gamesys.

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:09.460
We were founded in 2001.

00:04:09.460 --> 00:04:12.310
We're based in London,
in the UK.

00:04:12.310 --> 00:04:16.200
We have relatively quickly grown
to be a market leader in

00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:18.670
what is arguably the most
competitive online gaming

00:04:18.670 --> 00:04:20.660
market in the world.

00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:26.040
We currently have about $5
billion in turnover annually,

00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:28.780
and I think this says a little
bit about the stature of the

00:04:28.780 --> 00:04:29.800
company today.

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:33.280
We were the first company that
Facebook approached to launch

00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:38.360
real money gaming on
Facebook last year.

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:41.840
And we've grown from about
10 people in 2011

00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:44.170
to about 1,000 today.

00:04:44.170 --> 00:04:45.815
We started investing
in social gaming--

00:04:45.815 --> 00:04:47.290
social and mobile, really--

00:04:47.290 --> 00:04:49.220
in 2011.

00:04:49.220 --> 00:04:52.220
And we've grown that team
organically from, again, about

00:04:52.220 --> 00:04:55.210
3 or 4 people to just
over 100 today.

00:04:55.210 --> 00:04:58.870
We're currently operating five
cross-platform games--

00:04:58.870 --> 00:05:02.620
so iOS, Android, and
on Facebook--

00:05:02.620 --> 00:05:06.420
and we're even operating a game
for PopCap and Electronic

00:05:06.420 --> 00:05:09.100
Arts, something we're
very proud of.

00:05:09.100 --> 00:05:11.900
So today, really, we're just
going to talk about a couple

00:05:11.900 --> 00:05:15.690
of the uses, particularly
within the social team.

00:05:15.690 --> 00:05:18.390
How we use the Google
Cloud Platform.

00:05:18.390 --> 00:05:20.150
I always have trouble
saying that.

00:05:20.150 --> 00:05:23.880
So we're going to focus, really,
on cloud storage,

00:05:23.880 --> 00:05:26.610
BigQuery, App Engine, and we're
going to talk a little

00:05:26.610 --> 00:05:28.160
bit about the prediction
API as well, and how

00:05:28.160 --> 00:05:30.810
we plan to use that.

00:05:30.810 --> 00:05:37.330
So I get asked this a lot,
particularly by developers.

00:05:37.330 --> 00:05:39.370
Why not build a cool
infrastructure?

00:05:39.370 --> 00:05:43.480
Why not have big data
projects internally?

00:05:43.480 --> 00:05:47.460
And I sort of say, we do, but we
use Google because we like

00:05:47.460 --> 00:05:51.300
to focus on building products,
and trying to get away from

00:05:51.300 --> 00:05:52.100
building infrastructures.

00:05:52.100 --> 00:05:54.370
So really spending our time on
trying to make really, really,

00:05:54.370 --> 00:05:58.220
really fantastic games and
products for our customers.

00:05:58.220 --> 00:06:01.020
And so we can build with Google
because we always plan

00:06:01.020 --> 00:06:03.270
for success, and success
means that we're

00:06:03.270 --> 00:06:06.050
going to need to scale.

00:06:06.050 --> 00:06:09.190
And obviously, Google are an
expert in building excellent

00:06:09.190 --> 00:06:11.650
scalable services.

00:06:11.650 --> 00:06:13.040
We really love all
the Google APIs.

00:06:15.570 --> 00:06:18.350
Doing an integration with one
of these Google services

00:06:18.350 --> 00:06:21.450
really means that through
these rich APIs, you can

00:06:21.450 --> 00:06:24.260
really use them as just a
building block, and build a

00:06:24.260 --> 00:06:27.000
lot of interesting tools
around them.

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:29.320
And that's something that I
think gives you a lot of

00:06:29.320 --> 00:06:31.420
synergies when you start to
integrate your own systems

00:06:31.420 --> 00:06:34.190
with the Google Cloud
Platform.

00:06:34.190 --> 00:06:35.690
And third, it's reliable.

00:06:35.690 --> 00:06:40.370
I think the less software that
I need to run and to maintain

00:06:40.370 --> 00:06:42.850
and to monitor, the better.

00:06:42.850 --> 00:06:43.850
I'd just like to
sleep at night.

00:06:43.850 --> 00:06:47.490
Call me lazy, but
I enjoy sleep.

00:06:47.490 --> 00:06:51.460
And when we use Google Cloud
Platform, we just, for the

00:06:51.460 --> 00:06:52.670
most part, don't need
to worry about it.

00:06:52.670 --> 00:06:55.850
We can trust that it's
going to do its job.

00:06:55.850 --> 00:07:00.290
So today, we're going to tell
you a little bit about a new

00:07:00.290 --> 00:07:03.030
game that we have, and that's
really just to paint a picture

00:07:03.030 --> 00:07:05.510
of what these connected products
look like-- these

00:07:05.510 --> 00:07:07.080
connected games--

00:07:07.080 --> 00:07:08.510
how they work.

00:07:08.510 --> 00:07:12.730
We're going to talk a lot about
the importance of data.

00:07:12.730 --> 00:07:15.300
And then we're going to move on
to talk a little bit about

00:07:15.300 --> 00:07:17.290
how we industrialize the
learnings that we get from

00:07:17.290 --> 00:07:19.010
this data, and build
tools that help

00:07:19.010 --> 00:07:21.870
us operate our business.

00:07:21.870 --> 00:07:25.530
So "Here Be Monsters" is a
pretty ambitious project.

00:07:25.530 --> 00:07:28.000
It started about a year
and a half ago.

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:31.860
It's a social game, but we're
trying to take it a little bit

00:07:31.860 --> 00:07:37.010
of a step further and give
it a bit of an RPG feel.

00:07:37.010 --> 00:07:40.520
So it's an online MMO, we're
building it for the web, and

00:07:40.520 --> 00:07:43.510
we're also building it for
Android tablets and the iPad.

00:07:43.510 --> 00:07:46.300
So it'll be launching on the
iPad first, and that should

00:07:46.300 --> 00:07:47.640
come in about early September.

00:07:47.640 --> 00:07:48.970
We're really excited about it.

00:07:48.970 --> 00:07:52.850
So when it's out, definitely
check it out.

00:07:52.850 --> 00:07:54.880
So in Here Be Monsters, you've
got an entire world.

00:07:54.880 --> 00:07:57.020
It's an isometric 2D game.

00:07:57.020 --> 00:08:00.770
You've got an entire world that
you can go and explore.

00:08:00.770 --> 00:08:03.580
And currently, I think-- we're
in beta right now-- currently,

00:08:03.580 --> 00:08:08.080
I think there's about 3,000 to
3,500 unique distinct objects

00:08:08.080 --> 00:08:10.510
which exist within the game.

00:08:10.510 --> 00:08:13.850
And so I think the point I'm
trying to make here is that

00:08:13.850 --> 00:08:15.460
Here Be Monsters is all about
data, and we're just

00:08:15.460 --> 00:08:19.580
constantly pushing new items
that the players can run

00:08:19.580 --> 00:08:21.060
around the world and collect.

00:08:21.060 --> 00:08:24.270
And once they do collect all
these items, they can combine

00:08:24.270 --> 00:08:27.270
them in really interesting
ways to craft bigger and

00:08:27.270 --> 00:08:28.370
better items.

00:08:28.370 --> 00:08:33.049
So a very, very typical
kind of RPG mechanic.

00:08:33.049 --> 00:08:35.400
And why do they want to go
around the world and collect

00:08:35.400 --> 00:08:37.700
all these items and build all
these interesting things?

00:08:37.700 --> 00:08:40.580
Well, they do it because they
want to catch monsters.

00:08:40.580 --> 00:08:42.750
And in order to catch monsters,
there's a trapping

00:08:42.750 --> 00:08:43.470
element to the game.

00:08:43.470 --> 00:08:45.570
So you can build really, really
interesting traps.

00:08:45.570 --> 00:08:48.050
You can travel around to the
right parts of the world.

00:08:48.050 --> 00:08:50.660
You can put some bait
in your trap.

00:08:50.660 --> 00:08:53.090
And then periodically, you'll
check your trap, and you're

00:08:53.090 --> 00:08:57.150
hoping that you've caught the
monster that you're after.

00:08:57.150 --> 00:08:59.640
So now I'll just show you really
quickly what the game

00:08:59.640 --> 00:09:00.890
looks like.

00:09:08.730 --> 00:09:13.100
So hopefully, you guys
can see this.

00:09:13.100 --> 00:09:13.790
We had a little bit
of a problem

00:09:13.790 --> 00:09:15.295
with the monitor earlier.

00:09:15.295 --> 00:09:16.720
That looks good.

00:09:16.720 --> 00:09:18.400
OK, so here's "Here Be
Monsters." That's my little

00:09:18.400 --> 00:09:20.240
character there running
around.

00:09:20.240 --> 00:09:22.810
You can see a trap that I've
set here which is actually

00:09:22.810 --> 00:09:23.630
ready to check.

00:09:23.630 --> 00:09:27.010
But the point that I'm trying to
make here is that the world

00:09:27.010 --> 00:09:27.750
is really big.

00:09:27.750 --> 00:09:30.720
This is just one isometric scene
that players can visit

00:09:30.720 --> 00:09:32.750
and run around and
interact with.

00:09:32.750 --> 00:09:33.960
And everything is interactive.

00:09:33.960 --> 00:09:37.290
You can see a couple of players
down there, actually,

00:09:37.290 --> 00:09:39.340
sort of standing around.

00:09:39.340 --> 00:09:40.340
Some of them are probably
fishing.

00:09:40.340 --> 00:09:42.690
I think we broke the game
recently, so you can't see the

00:09:42.690 --> 00:09:45.070
fact that they're fishing.

00:09:45.070 --> 00:09:46.380
But all of the elements
are interactive.

00:09:46.380 --> 00:09:48.280
So they can go around and pick
up-- for example, we can pick

00:09:48.280 --> 00:09:52.360
up some grass or a dandelion.

00:09:52.360 --> 00:09:54.040
We can go fishing.

00:09:54.040 --> 00:09:56.660
There we go, we picked up some
grass and some dandelions.

00:09:56.660 --> 00:09:59.090
We put those in our backpack.

00:09:59.090 --> 00:10:00.600
And we can combine those.

00:10:00.600 --> 00:10:02.900
Again, we can take them back
home, we can craft them into

00:10:02.900 --> 00:10:05.370
bigger and better items, and we
can carry on with the game.

00:10:05.370 --> 00:10:07.280
And the way that we lead players
through the game is

00:10:07.280 --> 00:10:08.640
really through the
questing system.

00:10:08.640 --> 00:10:10.680
So players travel around the
world, and they meet

00:10:10.680 --> 00:10:12.690
non-player characters.

00:10:12.690 --> 00:10:14.320
And when they meet those
non-player characters, they're

00:10:14.320 --> 00:10:16.180
given all sorts of different
tasks that they need to do.

00:10:16.180 --> 00:10:18.390
So they start off very, very
simple, and then they progress

00:10:18.390 --> 00:10:20.600
and get more and more complex,
meaning that you really need

00:10:20.600 --> 00:10:23.500
to get out there into the world,
find all these items,

00:10:23.500 --> 00:10:27.080
discover them, and discover the
recipes on how you make

00:10:27.080 --> 00:10:29.910
better and better items.

00:10:29.910 --> 00:10:31.200
Just to give you a sense
of some of the

00:10:31.200 --> 00:10:32.270
artwork in the world--

00:10:32.270 --> 00:10:33.560
so this is the world.

00:10:33.560 --> 00:10:37.120
It's a game that's based on the
real world, and it's full

00:10:37.120 --> 00:10:39.220
of isometric scenes that
you can visit.

00:10:39.220 --> 00:10:43.310
So if I zoom in, all of these
little icons here, they all

00:10:43.310 --> 00:10:47.940
represent unique isometric 2D
scenes that players can visit,

00:10:47.940 --> 00:10:49.660
and they're full of different
kinds of items.

00:10:49.660 --> 00:10:51.450
There are different trees,
different butterflies,

00:10:51.450 --> 00:10:53.920
different flowers.

00:10:53.920 --> 00:10:56.270
And I think the coolest thing
about the game, too, is that

00:10:56.270 --> 00:10:58.250
the monsters are actually
all taken

00:10:58.250 --> 00:11:01.570
from real human mythology.

00:11:01.570 --> 00:11:04.640
So if you wanted to find a
specific kind of monster that

00:11:04.640 --> 00:11:08.070
you know about, chances are that
it's going to be in the

00:11:08.070 --> 00:11:09.490
area that you would expect
it to be in.

00:11:09.490 --> 00:11:11.210
But if you need to look
it up, you can

00:11:11.210 --> 00:11:12.250
always go into the almanac.

00:11:12.250 --> 00:11:14.860
I'll just show you
that as well.

00:11:14.860 --> 00:11:15.330
So the almanac--

00:11:15.330 --> 00:11:17.930
this is the dandelion pixie,
which is one of the nicer

00:11:17.930 --> 00:11:20.460
looking monsters that you can
go out and try and catch.

00:11:20.460 --> 00:11:22.170
But there's a lot of information
within the almanac

00:11:22.170 --> 00:11:24.800
that tells you all about all
the different monsters.

00:11:24.800 --> 00:11:26.735
For example, a chimera, which
is probably something that

00:11:26.735 --> 00:11:29.140
some people are familiar with,
the different baits that you

00:11:29.140 --> 00:11:32.750
might have to craft in
order to trap them.

00:11:32.750 --> 00:11:34.320
So hopefully, this is kind of
making the point, there's a

00:11:34.320 --> 00:11:36.310
ton of data in this game.

00:11:36.310 --> 00:11:40.640
And the strategy behind this
game is that we built a really

00:11:40.640 --> 00:11:43.770
interesting kind of CMS behind
the scenes that allows us to

00:11:43.770 --> 00:11:48.460
push a lot of content on a
weekly basis, because we

00:11:48.460 --> 00:11:50.550
expect that a lot of the most
engaged users are going to

00:11:50.550 --> 00:11:52.070
tear through the content.

00:11:52.070 --> 00:11:53.590
So it's very, very important
that if we want to keep them

00:11:53.590 --> 00:11:56.370
engaged, we need to be
constantly releasing new and

00:11:56.370 --> 00:11:57.880
better content for this game.

00:12:09.440 --> 00:12:09.840
Great.

00:12:09.840 --> 00:12:11.440
So, all right.

00:12:11.440 --> 00:12:12.850
So we've sort of painted a
little bit of a picture.

00:12:12.850 --> 00:12:14.790
We've got a lot of players,
they're running around,

00:12:14.790 --> 00:12:16.060
they're doing all these
different activities.

00:12:16.060 --> 00:12:19.530
They can visit friends, they can
send gifts, they can farm

00:12:19.530 --> 00:12:21.660
on their homesteads, they
can craft items,

00:12:21.660 --> 00:12:24.060
they can collect items.

00:12:24.060 --> 00:12:25.210
So what does this mean?

00:12:25.210 --> 00:12:29.520
Well, what it means is that we
generate a ton of events.

00:12:29.520 --> 00:12:34.410
There's a lot of raw data,
and that raw data--

00:12:34.410 --> 00:12:36.800
I'd say five or six years ago,
you probably wouldn't have

00:12:36.800 --> 00:12:40.940
recorded every single little
step that a player made and

00:12:40.940 --> 00:12:42.000
all of the different
properties that

00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:43.870
go along with that.

00:12:43.870 --> 00:12:46.470
But today, it's pretty much
a necessity if you want to

00:12:46.470 --> 00:12:48.470
operate one of these games,
and you want to operate it

00:12:48.470 --> 00:12:52.770
well and optimize it and run
it as a solid business.

00:12:52.770 --> 00:12:53.930
But that means you're
going to generate a

00:12:53.930 --> 00:12:55.600
huge amount of data.

00:12:55.600 --> 00:12:57.610
And just to give you an idea of
the sorts of levels of data

00:12:57.610 --> 00:12:59.800
that we see-- and to be honest,
there are plenty of

00:12:59.800 --> 00:13:01.090
other companies that are
probably generating

00:13:01.090 --> 00:13:02.640
even more than this.

00:13:02.640 --> 00:13:05.650
"Here Be Monsters" right now has
got about 10,000 people in

00:13:05.650 --> 00:13:08.180
a limited beta on Facebook.

00:13:08.180 --> 00:13:11.210
And those 10,000 players are
generating about a million

00:13:11.210 --> 00:13:14.010
sessions a month, and
about 200 million

00:13:14.010 --> 00:13:15.130
unique events a month.

00:13:15.130 --> 00:13:19.670
So 200 million actions taken
by 10,000 daily actives.

00:13:19.670 --> 00:13:22.300
We've got other games currently
that are running.

00:13:22.300 --> 00:13:25.400
Game 2 there, launched about
three months ago, has already

00:13:25.400 --> 00:13:27.620
got 150,000 people playing
it every day.

00:13:27.620 --> 00:13:33.050
They're generating about
500 million events

00:13:33.050 --> 00:13:34.380
every single month.

00:13:34.380 --> 00:13:36.670
And then one of our larger games
is generating in the

00:13:36.670 --> 00:13:38.196
billions of events
every month.

00:13:41.400 --> 00:13:43.670
All of this data goes
into BigQuery.

00:13:43.670 --> 00:13:46.450
And the reason why we really
like BigQuery at Gamesys is

00:13:46.450 --> 00:13:50.810
that it's managed, so there's
almost nothing you need to do

00:13:50.810 --> 00:13:53.790
to get set up.

00:13:53.790 --> 00:13:55.230
It scales.

00:13:55.230 --> 00:13:56.690
I'm going to say this
a lot today.

00:13:56.690 --> 00:14:00.640
We really cannot integrate with
a service where we think

00:14:00.640 --> 00:14:02.880
that it can't scale, and
BigQuery definitely has a lot

00:14:02.880 --> 00:14:05.380
of power and can do the sorts
of things that we

00:14:05.380 --> 00:14:06.180
want to do with it.

00:14:06.180 --> 00:14:09.120
And then also the fact that
you're just writing SQL.

00:14:09.120 --> 00:14:11.660
Anybody can write a BigQuery,
and that's pretty awesome,

00:14:11.660 --> 00:14:14.870
because our analysts don't like
training days and this

00:14:14.870 --> 00:14:16.120
sort of thing.

00:14:16.120 --> 00:14:20.060
Because they already know SQL,
and they know it really well,

00:14:20.060 --> 00:14:22.360
the transition is extremely easy
for them to go and start

00:14:22.360 --> 00:14:24.185
writing big, powerful queries.

00:14:26.750 --> 00:14:31.020
So to give you an idea of what
happens within our platform,

00:14:31.020 --> 00:14:32.510
every day, we've got all these
players coming in, they're

00:14:32.510 --> 00:14:35.460
playing the game, doing all
these different things, having

00:14:35.460 --> 00:14:36.630
a lot of fun.

00:14:36.630 --> 00:14:42.000
And at night, we aggregate all
of that events data into a

00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:46.480
couple of aggregated tables
just for convenience.

00:14:46.480 --> 00:14:49.920
And then we also upload all of
the raw events into a table

00:14:49.920 --> 00:14:51.170
within BigQuery.

00:14:55.420 --> 00:14:58.950
So these aggregations, these
aggregated tables, they're

00:14:58.950 --> 00:15:01.780
there for convenience, but they
help us drive, really,

00:15:01.780 --> 00:15:03.175
just high level KPI reporting.

00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:09.490
Just to give you an idea of a
couple of the tables that we

00:15:09.490 --> 00:15:12.290
use fairly consistently across
all of our games-- and you may

00:15:12.290 --> 00:15:14.470
want to define different ones
depending on the style of game

00:15:14.470 --> 00:15:14.970
or application--

00:15:14.970 --> 00:15:19.580
I mean, I think this applies to
really any digital product.

00:15:19.580 --> 00:15:20.770
The first is profiles.

00:15:20.770 --> 00:15:23.280
So profiles, when they're
aggregated at night, you get a

00:15:23.280 --> 00:15:25.610
picture of what that user's
state looked like at the end

00:15:25.610 --> 00:15:28.170
of the day, and that's
fairly important.

00:15:28.170 --> 00:15:30.060
Sessions are fairly
self-explanatory.

00:15:30.060 --> 00:15:34.690
They're essentially aggregated
groups of events that match a

00:15:34.690 --> 00:15:37.510
user's play periods.

00:15:37.510 --> 00:15:39.170
And then we have transactions.

00:15:39.170 --> 00:15:41.650
So transactions, obviously,
are really important.

00:15:41.650 --> 00:15:42.900
They drive the entire
business.

00:15:42.900 --> 00:15:46.900
We want to know when did someone
make a purchase, very,

00:15:46.900 --> 00:15:50.290
very specifically, so that we
can go and really dig into,

00:15:50.290 --> 00:15:52.860
what motivated them to
make that purchase?

00:15:52.860 --> 00:15:55.860
What did they do once they
bought that virtual currency

00:15:55.860 --> 00:15:57.740
or virtual good?

00:15:57.740 --> 00:15:59.390
How did they spend that
within the game?

00:15:59.390 --> 00:16:01.670
What sort of activities did they
engage with afterwards?

00:16:01.670 --> 00:16:05.630
It's really, really important
that we dig in and understand

00:16:05.630 --> 00:16:09.180
the purchasing behavior and the
behavior of our players,

00:16:09.180 --> 00:16:10.660
especially around the
time of purchase.

00:16:13.370 --> 00:16:15.420
So hopefully, I've been able
to paint a little bit of a

00:16:15.420 --> 00:16:19.600
picture about what the game
is, what kind of data it

00:16:19.600 --> 00:16:24.510
generates, the volumes of data
that it generates, and that we

00:16:24.510 --> 00:16:28.810
effectively every night update
a number of data sets and

00:16:28.810 --> 00:16:31.590
tables within BigQuery.

00:16:31.590 --> 00:16:35.150
So now that our data is in
BigQuery, and you understand

00:16:35.150 --> 00:16:37.930
the structure of that data,
we're going to talk just a

00:16:37.930 --> 00:16:39.170
little bit about how--

00:16:39.170 --> 00:16:41.900
this is probably one of the
simplest things you can do, in

00:16:41.900 --> 00:16:45.270
fact, once your data is in
BigQuery, and that is to

00:16:45.270 --> 00:16:49.950
integrate that data
with spreadsheets.

00:16:49.950 --> 00:16:53.050
So, to build, essentially,
reports of various shapes and

00:16:53.050 --> 00:16:55.350
sizes using Apps Script.

00:16:55.350 --> 00:16:58.650
This is incredibly easy to do.

00:16:58.650 --> 00:17:03.180
So using some of those
aggregated tables, on our

00:17:03.180 --> 00:17:05.319
teams, we build up dashboards.

00:17:05.319 --> 00:17:08.960
So we build relatively
complicated workbooks that

00:17:08.960 --> 00:17:11.640
everybody on the team
has access to.

00:17:11.640 --> 00:17:15.560
We look at a lot of
different metrics.

00:17:15.560 --> 00:17:17.420
We slice them in
different ways.

00:17:17.420 --> 00:17:19.819
But probably the simplest
would be a simple daily

00:17:19.819 --> 00:17:24.640
dashboard, and these really just
help to highlight high

00:17:24.640 --> 00:17:26.270
level KPI trends.

00:17:26.270 --> 00:17:30.770
And they often give you a bit
of a hint that just says,

00:17:30.770 --> 00:17:32.150
maybe we want to go
and look at this.

00:17:32.150 --> 00:17:33.940
Retention looks like it's a
little bit off for these

00:17:33.940 --> 00:17:36.010
players, or something's
happened, and

00:17:36.010 --> 00:17:37.270
our active user base--

00:17:37.270 --> 00:17:40.050
the retention dropped over the
next week, and we want to

00:17:40.050 --> 00:17:43.030
figure out why.

00:17:43.030 --> 00:17:44.340
And other people may want
to look at things

00:17:44.340 --> 00:17:45.170
like conversion rates.

00:17:45.170 --> 00:17:47.320
So when we have brand new
installs coming in on a given

00:17:47.320 --> 00:17:50.430
day or given week, we really
want to monitor the health of

00:17:50.430 --> 00:17:53.400
those users, compare them to
other install days, other

00:17:53.400 --> 00:17:56.520
install weeks, so that we feel
comfortable continuing with

00:17:56.520 --> 00:17:57.770
our acquisition spend.

00:18:00.630 --> 00:18:03.250
So now what I'll do is I'll just
show you very quickly for

00:18:03.250 --> 00:18:05.550
the developers that are in the
room, of which I would imagine

00:18:05.550 --> 00:18:11.980
there are lots of you, I'll just
show you how easy it is

00:18:11.980 --> 00:18:14.900
to basically integrate BigQuery
with spreadsheets,

00:18:14.900 --> 00:18:16.780
and to build reports this way.

00:18:16.780 --> 00:18:19.670
So what I've done here is
I've just given you--

00:18:19.670 --> 00:18:22.050
within our games, we tend to
have lots of different types

00:18:22.050 --> 00:18:23.170
of funnels.

00:18:23.170 --> 00:18:27.630
So funnels, really, are just
sequential events, and the

00:18:27.630 --> 00:18:30.600
fact that we've got all this
raw events data in BigQuery

00:18:30.600 --> 00:18:33.520
pretty much means we can define
any funnel we want.

00:18:33.520 --> 00:18:36.510
And that's pretty significant,
and pretty powerful.

00:18:36.510 --> 00:18:40.045
So let's just take this
as an example.

00:18:40.045 --> 00:18:43.420
I've called it the elementary
quest funnel analysis.

00:18:43.420 --> 00:18:45.340
But let's say we've got
a product manager.

00:18:45.340 --> 00:18:47.280
This week, they're going to
focus on a very specific part

00:18:47.280 --> 00:18:49.390
of the game.

00:18:49.390 --> 00:18:51.420
They think they've seen
a bit of drop-off.

00:18:51.420 --> 00:18:53.110
They've asked one of the
analysts to go away and do a

00:18:53.110 --> 00:18:54.180
bit of ad hoc analysis.

00:18:54.180 --> 00:18:57.500
They've identified the issue.

00:18:57.500 --> 00:18:58.990
And now what they
want to see is.

00:18:58.990 --> 00:19:01.140
As they make these iterations
daily, and they keep pushing

00:19:01.140 --> 00:19:04.440
these releases, we want to get
that data in front of a

00:19:04.440 --> 00:19:05.090
product manager.

00:19:05.090 --> 00:19:07.060
And a product manager doesn't
necessarily know how to go

00:19:07.060 --> 00:19:10.360
into BigQuery and write a bunch
of SQL, nor should they

00:19:10.360 --> 00:19:13.440
have to, because our analysts
can simply create a new

00:19:13.440 --> 00:19:15.860
workbook that's specifically
for that product manager,

00:19:15.860 --> 00:19:19.450
define a query that can go away
and look at those tables,

00:19:19.450 --> 00:19:22.570
pull out all the interesting
events that matter, and

00:19:22.570 --> 00:19:27.170
summarize that into a sample
little dashboard.

00:19:27.170 --> 00:19:28.170
So how do you do that?

00:19:28.170 --> 00:19:32.100
Well, to be honest, I didn't
even know this stuff existed

00:19:32.100 --> 00:19:34.840
about nine months ago until I
did a little bit of digging

00:19:34.840 --> 00:19:36.860
around and had a few
chats with Matt.

00:19:36.860 --> 00:19:39.610
But we've started using it
heavily, and it's fantastic.

00:19:39.610 --> 00:19:43.070
So you need to go into the
script editor to start working

00:19:43.070 --> 00:19:45.230
with Apps Script, and you'll
find it under the Tools menu.

00:19:45.230 --> 00:19:46.890
So if you go to the Tools menu
and you go down here, this

00:19:46.890 --> 00:19:48.510
script editor thing-- if you've
ever wondered what that

00:19:48.510 --> 00:19:54.090
is, well, for those you that are
new to Apps Script, that

00:19:54.090 --> 00:19:55.180
will open the script editor.

00:19:55.180 --> 00:19:57.840
And what you'll see here is
essentially JavaScript.

00:19:57.840 --> 00:20:00.450
So Apps Script is basically
JavaScript.

00:20:00.450 --> 00:20:02.420
And I'll just show you.

00:20:02.420 --> 00:20:08.660
So this function here is just
a very simple function which

00:20:08.660 --> 00:20:11.900
takes a query, which is just
our SQL statement.

00:20:11.900 --> 00:20:17.090
I've put it in a comment down
here, just to illustrate the

00:20:17.090 --> 00:20:18.100
complexity of the query.

00:20:18.100 --> 00:20:19.460
So this is a big
complex query.

00:20:19.460 --> 00:20:26.230
It's going query about 200
million rows of data, and it's

00:20:26.230 --> 00:20:27.970
going to pull the results back,
and it's going to put

00:20:27.970 --> 00:20:30.510
that into our spreadsheet.

00:20:30.510 --> 00:20:34.490
So how do you connect to
BigQuery within Apps Script?

00:20:34.490 --> 00:20:35.630
Well, it's actually
really simple.

00:20:35.630 --> 00:20:38.270
So here's a little convenience
function that I wrote, which

00:20:38.270 --> 00:20:41.370
is run query async, and it's
really just broken down into

00:20:41.370 --> 00:20:41.940
three parts.

00:20:41.940 --> 00:20:45.870
So you've got this job
description here, which is

00:20:45.870 --> 00:20:46.820
very, very simple to set up.

00:20:46.820 --> 00:20:49.550
And you can see that we're
passing in our SQL statements.

00:20:49.550 --> 00:20:52.670
That's just a string that
represents our SQL statement.

00:20:52.670 --> 00:20:54.920
You can then insert the job.

00:20:54.920 --> 00:20:56.160
So again, very, very simple.

00:20:56.160 --> 00:20:58.460
That's basically passing it off
to BigQuery and asking it

00:20:58.460 --> 00:21:00.420
to actually execute the query.

00:21:00.420 --> 00:21:03.580
And then all we do here
is we just wait.

00:21:03.580 --> 00:21:05.690
We wait asynchronously,
and we pull to see

00:21:05.690 --> 00:21:07.250
if the job is complete.

00:21:07.250 --> 00:21:09.270
And then finally, when the
results come back, we go ahead

00:21:09.270 --> 00:21:14.380
and fetch them just here,
and then we return them.

00:21:14.380 --> 00:21:16.620
And that's essentially it.

00:21:16.620 --> 00:21:21.230
So if we run that now,
hopefully this will--

00:21:21.230 --> 00:21:21.640
oh, sorry.

00:21:21.640 --> 00:21:23.680
This is one other thing you can
do, which is, again, for

00:21:23.680 --> 00:21:26.760
convenience, is you can very
easily just add your own

00:21:26.760 --> 00:21:27.440
custom menus.

00:21:27.440 --> 00:21:29.200
So you can see this little
bit of code here.

00:21:29.200 --> 00:21:29.980
That's all that does.

00:21:29.980 --> 00:21:33.030
So I get a nice little menu
item here, and this button

00:21:33.030 --> 00:21:35.540
here is hooked to my function.

00:21:35.540 --> 00:21:39.930
Now, the other thing I'll
mention as well--

00:21:39.930 --> 00:21:42.350
when you're building up, say,
daily dashboards or monthly

00:21:42.350 --> 00:21:46.340
dashboards, a really nice,
simple way to get them to

00:21:46.340 --> 00:21:48.730
automatically run every day
is with the triggers

00:21:48.730 --> 00:21:49.360
functionality.

00:21:49.360 --> 00:21:53.030
So this little icon here
is the triggers.

00:21:53.030 --> 00:21:57.640
To set up a new periodic trigger
is extremely simple.

00:21:57.640 --> 00:22:01.760
Just go here and add a trigger,
select the function

00:22:01.760 --> 00:22:05.280
that you want to run, select
that you want it to be time

00:22:05.280 --> 00:22:07.450
driven, and there's a bunch
of different options here.

00:22:07.450 --> 00:22:10.410
So if this was a daily thing
that we wanted to refresh, I

00:22:10.410 --> 00:22:13.150
would select daily, select the
time we want it to run-- so

00:22:13.150 --> 00:22:14.950
let's say we want it
to run at 6:00 AM.

00:22:14.950 --> 00:22:16.685
We'd save that.

00:22:16.685 --> 00:22:19.080
And now this spreadsheet's going
to automatically run

00:22:19.080 --> 00:22:22.360
that query for you at between
6:00 and 7:00 AM.

00:22:22.360 --> 00:22:24.320
And so when you get it in the
morning, just pop open your

00:22:24.320 --> 00:22:27.400
workbook or open your phone, and
that funnel announcement

00:22:27.400 --> 00:22:28.870
is right there for
you to look at.

00:22:28.870 --> 00:22:32.300
So let's just run the
query very quickly.

00:22:32.300 --> 00:22:34.870
Again, so this isn't a massive,
massive data set, but

00:22:34.870 --> 00:22:36.170
it's pretty big.

00:22:36.170 --> 00:22:38.270
And obviously, we're running
this for our other games as

00:22:38.270 --> 00:22:39.955
well on much larger data sets.

00:22:39.955 --> 00:22:41.900
This is about 200
million rows.

00:22:41.900 --> 00:22:44.470
So it's running, and
there we go.

00:22:44.470 --> 00:22:47.770
So all of our interesting data
that we were interested in

00:22:47.770 --> 00:22:50.400
about these different events
throughout our funnel, we've

00:22:50.400 --> 00:22:53.160
tracked that, we split it by
Tier 1 countries and non-Tier

00:22:53.160 --> 00:22:54.540
1, which is basically
English speaking

00:22:54.540 --> 00:22:56.990
and not English speaking.

00:22:56.990 --> 00:22:59.830
And we can see the results
visualized on our graph below.

00:22:59.830 --> 00:23:03.560
So that's how easy it is,
really, to take these massive

00:23:03.560 --> 00:23:07.330
data sets and actually produce a
workbook, a spreadsheet that

00:23:07.330 --> 00:23:11.650
everybody knows how to access,
and really get this important

00:23:11.650 --> 00:23:13.390
data in front of the teams
that are working on

00:23:13.390 --> 00:23:14.640
the games every day.

00:23:24.590 --> 00:23:24.890
Great.

00:23:24.890 --> 00:23:27.240
So we're going to switch
gears a little bit now.

00:23:27.240 --> 00:23:29.440
Again, that was a relatively
simple example of what you can

00:23:29.440 --> 00:23:33.260
do to hook BigQuery up to

00:23:33.260 --> 00:23:35.040
spreadsheets using Apps Script.

00:23:35.040 --> 00:23:36.640
There's a lot of other things
you can do with Apps Script as

00:23:36.640 --> 00:23:38.870
well, so definitely
have a look at it.

00:23:38.870 --> 00:23:41.340
You can convert those
spreadsheets to PDFs, you can

00:23:41.340 --> 00:23:42.390
email them to everybody.

00:23:42.390 --> 00:23:44.610
There's loads and loads you
can do with them, so

00:23:44.610 --> 00:23:47.150
definitely have a good
look at that.

00:23:47.150 --> 00:23:49.750
So now we're going to talk a
little bit about how we build

00:23:49.750 --> 00:23:52.570
tools that kind of industrialize
our learning.

00:23:52.570 --> 00:23:55.540
So we do do a ton of
ad hoc analysis.

00:23:55.540 --> 00:23:58.050
We've got four or five analysts
on our team that are

00:23:58.050 --> 00:23:59.850
looking at our data
every single day.

00:24:04.460 --> 00:24:06.760
All right, that's what
we've looked at.

00:24:06.760 --> 00:24:08.970
But the next thing we're going
to look at is how we take

00:24:08.970 --> 00:24:13.410
those learnings and how we build
tools that also interact

00:24:13.410 --> 00:24:18.340
with our data to kind of
automate optimizations that we

00:24:18.340 --> 00:24:22.050
see or automate tooling
that can help us.

00:24:22.050 --> 00:24:24.100
And so the first one we're going
to talk about is a tool

00:24:24.100 --> 00:24:26.830
that is called Mailman.

00:24:26.830 --> 00:24:29.650
It's an engagement tool, and
it's built with App Engine.

00:24:34.180 --> 00:24:35.550
So App Engine--

00:24:35.550 --> 00:24:36.700
we get asked this
a lot as well.

00:24:36.700 --> 00:24:38.550
Why do we use App Engine?

00:24:38.550 --> 00:24:41.130
If anybody wants to go for a
beer later, I can talk to for

00:24:41.130 --> 00:24:43.430
about two hours on all the
reasons why I love App Engine.

00:24:43.430 --> 00:24:48.450
App Engine is fantastic, and
integrating it with other

00:24:48.450 --> 00:24:51.680
Google services really
make it even better.

00:24:51.680 --> 00:24:54.340
But just simply, if we had to
boil it down into a couple of

00:24:54.340 --> 00:24:57.380
points, it's super productive,
right?

00:24:57.380 --> 00:25:01.430
So I think I've said this
already today, but we just

00:25:01.430 --> 00:25:04.690
like to focus on the problems
and leave some of the heavy

00:25:04.690 --> 00:25:07.270
lifting to the Google
Cloud Platform.

00:25:07.270 --> 00:25:09.700
And it's pretty powerful,
particularly for small teams

00:25:09.700 --> 00:25:11.050
that are trying to grow
their businesses.

00:25:11.050 --> 00:25:13.670
You need every minute of every
day on your products, not on

00:25:13.670 --> 00:25:15.710
infrastructure.

00:25:15.710 --> 00:25:17.150
The deployment model's
really cool.

00:25:17.150 --> 00:25:18.630
All of our guys love the
deployment model.

00:25:18.630 --> 00:25:22.450
We can't actually take advantage
of it as much as,

00:25:22.450 --> 00:25:24.740
say, if you had a website that
you could, but we still make

00:25:24.740 --> 00:25:26.370
very, very good use of it.

00:25:26.370 --> 00:25:27.460
And then, of course, scale.

00:25:27.460 --> 00:25:29.105
We mentioned this
once or twice.

00:25:29.105 --> 00:25:30.840
We're going to mention
it again.

00:25:30.840 --> 00:25:33.530
We cannot integrate with any
service that we don't believe

00:25:33.530 --> 00:25:35.400
can scale along with us, because
we're always planning

00:25:35.400 --> 00:25:35.970
for success.

00:25:35.970 --> 00:25:39.200
We're expecting big numbers, big
traffic, big concurrency.

00:25:39.200 --> 00:25:41.060
And if we're going to build
tools that run alongside our

00:25:41.060 --> 00:25:42.430
games that our games platform's
going to be

00:25:42.430 --> 00:25:45.720
speaking to at that sort of
level, we have to make the

00:25:45.720 --> 00:25:46.350
right decisions.

00:25:46.350 --> 00:25:47.470
And we feel very, very
good about our

00:25:47.470 --> 00:25:48.670
choice of App Engine.

00:25:48.670 --> 00:25:52.600
We've been working with it
for about two years now.

00:25:52.600 --> 00:25:54.430
So Mailman, just to dig into--

00:25:54.430 --> 00:25:55.700
this is just one of the
tools we've built.

00:25:55.700 --> 00:25:56.370
We've built a number.

00:25:56.370 --> 00:25:59.020
We decided to focus on
these two today.

00:25:59.020 --> 00:26:04.600
So Mailman really is an
automated delivery mechanism

00:26:04.600 --> 00:26:07.290
or delivery tool
for messaging.

00:26:07.290 --> 00:26:09.500
It's really important
within our games.

00:26:09.500 --> 00:26:10.850
People aren't playing
our games all

00:26:10.850 --> 00:26:12.510
day, and that's healthy.

00:26:12.510 --> 00:26:17.070
Some of them actually do, which
we're worried about, but

00:26:17.070 --> 00:26:18.050
most of them don't, right?

00:26:18.050 --> 00:26:20.130
Most of them are normal people,
and they come and go,

00:26:20.130 --> 00:26:22.790
and they play a lot of
different games.

00:26:22.790 --> 00:26:27.960
And so when we do our ad hoc
analysis, and we see the sorts

00:26:27.960 --> 00:26:30.620
of drop-off points that maybe
are concerning to us, and we

00:26:30.620 --> 00:26:33.620
see where people get stuck
within the game, sometimes

00:26:33.620 --> 00:26:34.900
it's too late for us.

00:26:34.900 --> 00:26:37.410
And because they got stuck in
the game at a certain point

00:26:37.410 --> 00:26:40.580
that we've now identified,
they're not

00:26:40.580 --> 00:26:42.320
planning on coming back.

00:26:42.320 --> 00:26:44.350
And so this is when we have to
basically reach out to them.

00:26:44.350 --> 00:26:45.790
And this is just one
case, right?

00:26:45.790 --> 00:26:49.230
We reach out to our players all
the time through email,

00:26:49.230 --> 00:26:53.020
through push notifications and
Facebook notifications.

00:26:53.020 --> 00:26:58.200
So the logical components
of Mailman are lists.

00:26:58.200 --> 00:26:59.890
Lists really answer the who.

00:26:59.890 --> 00:27:04.550
So the powerful bit about
lists is that lists are

00:27:04.550 --> 00:27:06.640
basically groups of message
recipients, so

00:27:06.640 --> 00:27:08.870
they represent players.

00:27:08.870 --> 00:27:11.440
And the list can be defined
with a query.

00:27:11.440 --> 00:27:13.360
So anything we can write a query
for, anything that we

00:27:13.360 --> 00:27:15.780
turn up in our ad hoc analysis,
we can just define a

00:27:15.780 --> 00:27:18.420
new list with a query.

00:27:18.420 --> 00:27:20.840
We use a little bit of
templating to make sure that

00:27:20.840 --> 00:27:23.910
we can use those same queries
over and over daily, if they

00:27:23.910 --> 00:27:25.330
need to be refreshed
daily, but it's a

00:27:25.330 --> 00:27:28.370
pretty powerful thing.

00:27:28.370 --> 00:27:30.730
And what actually happens
technically under the hood

00:27:30.730 --> 00:27:36.280
when one of those lists are
created is that under the

00:27:36.280 --> 00:27:38.760
hood, we basically make
a query to BigQuery.

00:27:38.760 --> 00:27:40.890
And for those of you that are
familiar with App Engine, we

00:27:40.890 --> 00:27:44.085
store the results, no matter how
large they are-- we store

00:27:44.085 --> 00:27:46.800
those results in
the Blobstore.

00:27:46.800 --> 00:27:49.400
And so jobs, when they
actually run--

00:27:49.400 --> 00:27:50.700
the messaging jobs--

00:27:50.700 --> 00:27:54.930
this is really where we take
advantage of App Engine's

00:27:54.930 --> 00:28:00.030
scale and parallelism, because
we make use of the MapReduce

00:28:00.030 --> 00:28:03.700
API and the pipeline APIs, and
that means that essentially,

00:28:03.700 --> 00:28:06.210
we can spin up a lot of
instances to go away and map

00:28:06.210 --> 00:28:08.420
over the results that we got
back from our query.

00:28:08.420 --> 00:28:10.100
And so jobs really represent--

00:28:10.100 --> 00:28:15.230
if lists are the who, then jobs
really answer the what,

00:28:15.230 --> 00:28:18.500
the when, and the where, because
what happens when this

00:28:18.500 --> 00:28:20.940
MapReduce job runs across all
these instances that just sort

00:28:20.940 --> 00:28:23.960
of fire up magically is that for
every single recipient and

00:28:23.960 --> 00:28:26.570
message that we're going to
send, we enqueue a task.

00:28:26.570 --> 00:28:29.840
And so sometimes we run huge,
huge volumes of messaging,

00:28:29.840 --> 00:28:32.180
whether it's email, push
notifications, Facebook

00:28:32.180 --> 00:28:33.370
notifications.

00:28:33.370 --> 00:28:35.160
You could very easily run a job
one night that's going to

00:28:35.160 --> 00:28:37.570
be to millions of users.

00:28:37.570 --> 00:28:40.940
And App Engine can handle
that pretty seamlessly.

00:28:40.940 --> 00:28:43.670
And one of the things you'll
find when you start working

00:28:43.670 --> 00:28:45.670
with App Engine is that there's
so many great APIs and

00:28:45.670 --> 00:28:48.600
services that are made available
to you when you

00:28:48.600 --> 00:28:50.570
build on that platform.

00:28:50.570 --> 00:28:52.310
And so one of the ways in which
we-- there's a feature

00:28:52.310 --> 00:28:54.760
called ETA, and ETA essentially
means that you can

00:28:54.760 --> 00:28:56.460
specify the earliest time
that you want a

00:28:56.460 --> 00:28:57.970
specific task to run.

00:28:57.970 --> 00:29:00.460
And so we actually use the ETA
feature within the task use to

00:29:00.460 --> 00:29:05.110
make sure that part of our query
on that list, one of the

00:29:05.110 --> 00:29:06.870
columns of data that comes
back for every row

00:29:06.870 --> 00:29:08.610
is actually a hint.

00:29:08.610 --> 00:29:11.890
And it hints to us what time of
day we should actually send

00:29:11.890 --> 00:29:14.570
out a message to make sure that
we get the highest chance

00:29:14.570 --> 00:29:16.920
that a user's going to respond
to that and engage with that

00:29:16.920 --> 00:29:18.400
message and come back
to the game.

00:29:18.400 --> 00:29:20.290
And so we use a lot.

00:29:20.290 --> 00:29:24.985
And obviously, we deliver across
the different channels.

00:29:24.985 --> 00:29:27.590
So that's Mailman.

00:29:27.590 --> 00:29:28.700
The next one we're going to talk
to you about-- this is

00:29:28.700 --> 00:29:30.960
the last one--

00:29:30.960 --> 00:29:36.750
is called Cobra, and Cobra is
also built on App Engine.

00:29:36.750 --> 00:29:40.220
So Cobra's really interesting
because as you can imagine,

00:29:40.220 --> 00:29:40.900
once your game's mature--

00:29:40.900 --> 00:29:43.000
you launch a game, it's out
there for three or six months.

00:29:43.000 --> 00:29:44.590
You're doing loads
of optimizations.

00:29:44.590 --> 00:29:45.760
You really start to push it.

00:29:45.760 --> 00:29:47.960
It's getting bigger and
bigger and bigger.

00:29:47.960 --> 00:29:50.520
And slowly, what you see
happening is that you can't

00:29:50.520 --> 00:29:53.600
just address users that
are, say, right on

00:29:53.600 --> 00:29:54.610
the bleeding edge.

00:29:54.610 --> 00:29:56.990
And you can't really just
address users that are on day

00:29:56.990 --> 00:29:58.310
one or day two or day three.

00:29:58.310 --> 00:30:00.810
But there's lots of different
strategies that you want to

00:30:00.810 --> 00:30:05.240
deploy to make sure that you
have the best chance at

00:30:05.240 --> 00:30:08.230
monetizing users at all of
the different stages

00:30:08.230 --> 00:30:09.610
of their life cycle.

00:30:09.610 --> 00:30:11.100
And so that's what Cobra
does for us.

00:30:11.100 --> 00:30:14.660
Cobra is basically a pricing and
promotions engine which is

00:30:14.660 --> 00:30:15.910
aware of players' profiles.

00:30:18.770 --> 00:30:21.370
Cobra is loosely integrated
with BigQuery, but is also

00:30:21.370 --> 00:30:24.370
heavily integrated with
our games platform.

00:30:24.370 --> 00:30:27.280
And the other thing that it does
is it acts as a middleman

00:30:27.280 --> 00:30:28.830
through all the transactions.

00:30:28.830 --> 00:30:31.800
No matter what the platform,
all of our transactions

00:30:31.800 --> 00:30:36.240
securely flow through Mailman,
are authenticated and

00:30:36.240 --> 00:30:39.350
validated, and then
they proceed.

00:30:39.350 --> 00:30:42.000
So if we think about the pricing
and promotions engine,

00:30:42.000 --> 00:30:44.380
what's actually happening today
is a very iterative

00:30:44.380 --> 00:30:46.340
process where we go away and
we do a lot of ad hoc

00:30:46.340 --> 00:30:51.530
analysis, and from that ad hoc
analysis, we come up with

00:30:51.530 --> 00:30:52.130
strategies.

00:30:52.130 --> 00:30:55.100
So different pricing and
promotion strategies that we

00:30:55.100 --> 00:31:00.330
want to basically program into
Cobra, and then deploy.

00:31:00.330 --> 00:31:03.620
And when someone actually does
interact with one of these

00:31:03.620 --> 00:31:06.960
offers, or a promotion, or a
response to maybe a subtle

00:31:06.960 --> 00:31:09.720
change in some of the pricing,
we record that.

00:31:09.720 --> 00:31:12.570
So they make a purchase, it's
tagged with a bunch of

00:31:12.570 --> 00:31:14.580
information about the
configuration that they

00:31:14.580 --> 00:31:18.480
responded to, and that flows
down into our games platform,

00:31:18.480 --> 00:31:21.660
which, again, nightly, comes
back up into BigQuery.

00:31:21.660 --> 00:31:24.510
And so we do a lot of manual
iterative processes there.

00:31:24.510 --> 00:31:26.980
And that works really,
really well.

00:31:26.980 --> 00:31:29.590
But one of the next things that
we're looking at is how

00:31:29.590 --> 00:31:31.370
we can use something called the
Prediction API, and this

00:31:31.370 --> 00:31:34.760
is another from Google which
I'm told is really, really

00:31:34.760 --> 00:31:38.820
heavily used internally, and not
used that much externally.

00:31:38.820 --> 00:31:41.210
But we definitely have
a use case for it.

00:31:41.210 --> 00:31:43.500
So just at a super high level,
because we're running out of

00:31:43.500 --> 00:31:51.020
time, the Prediction API kind
of has two functions.

00:31:51.020 --> 00:31:52.490
If you have a model--

00:31:52.490 --> 00:31:54.660
so you've got a lot of raw data,
which obviously we do,

00:31:54.660 --> 00:31:58.070
and many of you, I would
imagine, have as well--

00:31:58.070 --> 00:32:03.040
and you think that if you did
some analysis on that data,

00:32:03.040 --> 00:32:05.710
you might be able to come up
with some statistically

00:32:05.710 --> 00:32:10.700
significant indicators
of an outcome.

00:32:10.700 --> 00:32:14.340
So for us, within Cobra, that
might be, this user's profile

00:32:14.340 --> 00:32:17.930
looks like this right now.

00:32:17.930 --> 00:32:21.910
Which type of offer do I think
they're most likely to convert

00:32:21.910 --> 00:32:25.250
with, or to convert on?

00:32:25.250 --> 00:32:27.010
So basically, you just put
a bunch of data in cloud

00:32:27.010 --> 00:32:30.380
storage, you point that at
the training endpoint.

00:32:30.380 --> 00:32:32.260
Prediction will suck up all
the data, will train

00:32:32.260 --> 00:32:33.140
the model for you.

00:32:33.140 --> 00:32:35.700
And when it's complete, you can
actually query that model.

00:32:35.700 --> 00:32:38.830
So you can query that
statistical model with,

00:32:38.830 --> 00:32:41.140
essentially, what would be a
row of data-- so a row of

00:32:41.140 --> 00:32:42.120
these features.

00:32:42.120 --> 00:32:43.980
And that would try and
predict what that

00:32:43.980 --> 00:32:47.270
example value might be.

00:32:47.270 --> 00:32:49.640
So Cobra with Prediction.

00:32:49.640 --> 00:32:50.910
You can kind of see how
that would work.

00:32:50.910 --> 00:32:53.480
And so the way in which we might
use it, or one of the

00:32:53.480 --> 00:32:59.510
ways in which we might use it,
is to just help us train on

00:32:59.510 --> 00:33:03.310
our financial data, train on our
profiles data, and try and

00:33:03.310 --> 00:33:06.110
help us make even better
decisions about what kind of

00:33:06.110 --> 00:33:11.670
offers to surface to players
based on where they are in

00:33:11.670 --> 00:33:13.540
their lifetime.

00:33:13.540 --> 00:33:14.720
And that's a pretty
powerful thing.

00:33:14.720 --> 00:33:16.500
So that's something we're
experimenting with, and

00:33:16.500 --> 00:33:19.880
hopefully, maybe next year, we
can come back in and talk

00:33:19.880 --> 00:33:22.860
about how that went.

00:33:22.860 --> 00:33:28.400
So just to sort of recap, my big
thing is, we've grown the

00:33:28.400 --> 00:33:31.620
social team at Gamesys from
about 4 people sitting in a

00:33:31.620 --> 00:33:35.550
little hallway to 100 people
that occupy most of a floor.

00:33:35.550 --> 00:33:39.250
And I think one of the ways in
which we've done that is that

00:33:39.250 --> 00:33:43.370
we try and stand on the
shoulders of giants, and not

00:33:43.370 --> 00:33:44.670
try and replicate a
lot of work that

00:33:44.670 --> 00:33:46.320
can be done by others.

00:33:46.320 --> 00:33:48.520
And these are fantastic
products.

00:33:48.520 --> 00:33:51.100
And if you invest the time into
understanding how they

00:33:51.100 --> 00:33:54.340
work and what they can do for
you, you'll spend less time on

00:33:54.340 --> 00:33:56.950
all the boring, painful stuff.

00:33:56.950 --> 00:33:59.530
And you'll really be able to get
at your data, build really

00:33:59.530 --> 00:34:02.270
cool tools, and focus
on your game,

00:34:02.270 --> 00:34:05.860
which I think is paramount.

00:34:05.860 --> 00:34:06.340
MATT MCNEILL: Great.

00:34:06.340 --> 00:34:07.590
Thanks Tom.

00:34:12.560 --> 00:34:16.460
I hope you got a sense of some
of the insight that data is

00:34:16.460 --> 00:34:18.570
really bringing to gaming.

00:34:18.570 --> 00:34:20.670
I can see that I'm going to lose
another six months of my

00:34:20.670 --> 00:34:23.429
life when this game launches.

00:34:23.429 --> 00:34:25.889
But I think there's some trends
that I'm seeing across

00:34:25.889 --> 00:34:30.080
the industry, and one of the
things I'd say is, every

00:34:30.080 --> 00:34:33.600
successful game company seems
to have three components.

00:34:33.600 --> 00:34:36.560
The first is, obviously, the
technology, and that's often

00:34:36.560 --> 00:34:38.409
the obvious one where
people start.

00:34:38.409 --> 00:34:42.000
Hey, what technology, which
platforms do we choose?

00:34:42.000 --> 00:34:44.810
But it's what you
do on top of it.

00:34:44.810 --> 00:34:46.840
There's obviously the marketing
department and the

00:34:46.840 --> 00:34:48.120
user acquisition side--

00:34:48.120 --> 00:34:49.219
critically important.

00:34:49.219 --> 00:34:51.909
But the thing I think that is
somewhat neglected, where

00:34:51.909 --> 00:34:55.730
there's a real opportunity, is
in this area of analytics.

00:34:55.730 --> 00:34:58.530
And one thing I'd say about
the Google platforms--

00:34:58.530 --> 00:35:01.860
not just the Cloud Platform
that I'm involved in, but

00:35:01.860 --> 00:35:04.090
actually all of Google's
services--

00:35:04.090 --> 00:35:06.960
are helping game developers
and players

00:35:06.960 --> 00:35:09.410
across a whole suite.

00:35:09.410 --> 00:35:12.750
The Cloud Platform,
particularly, I think Tom

00:35:12.750 --> 00:35:15.000
really brought out
what's important.

00:35:15.000 --> 00:35:18.550
The platform is something,
really, which we built for us

00:35:18.550 --> 00:35:19.820
here at Google.

00:35:19.820 --> 00:35:21.065
This is our success.

00:35:21.065 --> 00:35:24.870
And our strategy over the last
18 months is to externalize

00:35:24.870 --> 00:35:26.560
that so that people
can use it.

00:35:26.560 --> 00:35:30.390
So for me, personally, it's
really exciting to see the

00:35:30.390 --> 00:35:32.800
work people like Tom, and
actually many of you in the

00:35:32.800 --> 00:35:36.540
audience, are really starting to
do to build in a different

00:35:36.540 --> 00:35:40.750
way and into the future, not
just of gaming, but technology

00:35:40.750 --> 00:35:41.610
as a whole.

00:35:41.610 --> 00:35:43.730
So I know we've had a
little bit of time.

00:35:43.730 --> 00:35:46.680
I can see we've got about four
minutes on the clock for Q&amp;A.

00:35:46.680 --> 00:35:48.710
So we'll take some questions
now, but if you've got

00:35:48.710 --> 00:35:51.860
anything else, we'll be at
the Cloud booth later on.

00:35:51.860 --> 00:35:54.420
So any questions now?

00:35:54.420 --> 00:35:57.490
We'll take a few.

00:35:57.490 --> 00:36:00.536
Otherwise, we can
grab some beers.

00:36:00.536 --> 00:36:03.010
Yeah, question here.

00:36:03.010 --> 00:36:05.580
AUDIENCE: Did you start with
BigQuery, or did you have to

00:36:05.580 --> 00:36:07.550
migrate over from
another RDBMS?

00:36:07.550 --> 00:36:11.700
And if so, what challenges
did you see?

00:36:11.700 --> 00:36:18.210
TOM NEWTON: For this sort of
work, to try and work with

00:36:18.210 --> 00:36:20.710
data sets that are this big,
within some of the other

00:36:20.710 --> 00:36:22.100
relational database services
that are out

00:36:22.100 --> 00:36:25.650
there, we really struggled.

00:36:25.650 --> 00:36:27.070
We really struggled.

00:36:27.070 --> 00:36:30.790
And we also spent a lot
of time just trying

00:36:30.790 --> 00:36:32.936
to make sure that--

00:36:32.936 --> 00:36:35.600
we ran into so many different
problems along the way.

00:36:35.600 --> 00:36:38.000
Particularly, when we started
some of these games, we never

00:36:38.000 --> 00:36:39.510
thought we'd generate
this much data.

00:36:39.510 --> 00:36:43.290
And at the time, we didn't
really have a good

00:36:43.290 --> 00:36:46.070
understanding of the fact that
recording all this data at

00:36:46.070 --> 00:36:48.840
this fine grain a level
was really necessary.

00:36:48.840 --> 00:36:52.690
And so when we started looking
at BigQuery, we were using

00:36:52.690 --> 00:36:57.140
MySQL databases, and that worked
relatively well to a

00:36:57.140 --> 00:36:58.760
certain point.

00:36:58.760 --> 00:37:01.930
But also, it required a fair
amount of maintenance and

00:37:01.930 --> 00:37:06.720
human intervention and sysadmins
and experts with

00:37:06.720 --> 00:37:07.470
that technology.

00:37:07.470 --> 00:37:10.810
And we just want
to make games.

00:37:10.810 --> 00:37:13.160
We don't want to have a bunch
of guys on the team that are

00:37:13.160 --> 00:37:16.150
constantly focused on trying
to maintain these pieces of

00:37:16.150 --> 00:37:18.320
software, not when there are
services like this that are

00:37:18.320 --> 00:37:20.570
out there that you can leverage
that just make life

00:37:20.570 --> 00:37:23.240
that much easier-- and to be
fair, are way more powerful,

00:37:23.240 --> 00:37:24.960
and come with fantastic APIs.

00:37:27.800 --> 00:37:29.080
So I hope that answers
your question.

00:37:29.080 --> 00:37:30.410
We can talk to you a little bit
more about it afterwards.

00:37:30.410 --> 00:37:31.500
AUDIENCE: I have one
more for you, too,

00:37:31.500 --> 00:37:32.640
if I can get a chance.

00:37:32.640 --> 00:37:33.470
TOM NEWTON: Sure.

00:37:33.470 --> 00:37:34.300
MATT MCNEILL: Yes.

00:37:34.300 --> 00:37:35.100
AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:37:35.100 --> 00:37:38.600
So you have these ETL processes
that you're running

00:37:38.600 --> 00:37:40.550
at the end of the day
or something, right?

00:37:40.550 --> 00:37:43.890
And then basically, you're using
all this infrastructure

00:37:43.890 --> 00:37:47.710
as a sort of [? all up ?] queue,
and you have all the

00:37:47.710 --> 00:37:49.200
services that you
run out of it.

00:37:49.200 --> 00:37:54.850
So I'm curious as to what were
the technical reasons for the

00:37:54.850 --> 00:37:58.050
new games that you're making
that you didn't choose just to

00:37:58.050 --> 00:38:02.180
build the whole thing on the
Google Cloud Platform and

00:38:02.180 --> 00:38:04.080
avoid having your own
servers right now?

00:38:04.080 --> 00:38:07.530
So were there lower latency
things, or some technological

00:38:07.530 --> 00:38:09.190
things that were missing?

00:38:09.190 --> 00:38:13.180
Because then it would avoid
having to do the ETL extract

00:38:13.180 --> 00:38:18.740
at the end, and then run your
own App Engine processes, and

00:38:18.740 --> 00:38:22.250
then extract that again out,
and putting it back in.

00:38:22.250 --> 00:38:22.770
TOM NEWTON: So, sorry.

00:38:22.770 --> 00:38:25.950
The question is, why don't we
build the games themselves on

00:38:25.950 --> 00:38:27.480
App Engine or on Google
Cloud Platform?

00:38:27.480 --> 00:38:29.320
AUDIENCE: What are the technical
features that are

00:38:29.320 --> 00:38:30.300
missing from there?

00:38:30.300 --> 00:38:33.630
TOM NEWTON: Well, for App
Engine, for games that require

00:38:33.630 --> 00:38:36.610
bidirectional socket
communication, you're not

00:38:36.610 --> 00:38:37.920
going to be able to do
that on App Engine.

00:38:37.920 --> 00:38:39.910
It's scaled at the moment
not particularly well.

00:38:39.910 --> 00:38:41.390
But now with Compute Engine
coming along, there's

00:38:41.390 --> 00:38:43.650
absolutely no reason why you
can't build an entire game

00:38:43.650 --> 00:38:46.770
stack on the Google
Cloud Platform.

00:38:46.770 --> 00:38:49.130
I think the thing to remember
is that we started building

00:38:49.130 --> 00:38:52.330
social games about 4 and 1/2
years ago, and built up a

00:38:52.330 --> 00:38:55.140
platform on another provider.

00:38:55.140 --> 00:38:57.880
And we've got a lot
of code there.

00:38:57.880 --> 00:38:58.560
We can leverage that.

00:38:58.560 --> 00:38:59.500
We can build games
really, really

00:38:59.500 --> 00:39:01.380
quickly on that platform.

00:39:01.380 --> 00:39:05.110
But to be honest, I'm
dying to find a game

00:39:05.110 --> 00:39:07.030
that sort of fits--

00:39:07.030 --> 00:39:08.630
maybe one of our next ones--
that we can actually build

00:39:08.630 --> 00:39:10.680
with App Engine, if
it makes sense.

00:39:10.680 --> 00:39:12.522
If it doesn't require
bidirectional sockets.

00:39:12.522 --> 00:39:13.772
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:39:16.050 --> 00:39:17.410
AUDIENCE: So two questions.

00:39:17.410 --> 00:39:20.940
What are you guys using
to visualize the data?

00:39:20.940 --> 00:39:23.740
Is it all just spreadsheets
with queries

00:39:23.740 --> 00:39:24.660
and put into a chart?

00:39:24.660 --> 00:39:28.070
Are you using any other
tools to visualize it?

00:39:28.070 --> 00:39:29.400
TOM NEWTON: We kind of let
people pick and choose what

00:39:29.400 --> 00:39:30.240
tools they want to use.

00:39:30.240 --> 00:39:36.660
So we have been fairly heavy
users of Tableau in the past.

00:39:36.660 --> 00:39:39.760
Some of our analysts just like
to work within Microsoft Excel

00:39:39.760 --> 00:39:42.540
sometimes, and they use the
connector for Excel, and they

00:39:42.540 --> 00:39:45.160
do a lot of visualizations
in there.

00:39:45.160 --> 00:39:47.830
But for the most part, to be
honest, our core dashboards

00:39:47.830 --> 00:39:54.060
and some of our most, I'd say,
insightful information sits

00:39:54.060 --> 00:39:56.630
within these dashboards that
we put together for each

00:39:56.630 --> 00:39:57.555
product now.

00:39:57.555 --> 00:39:59.600
And a lot of them are ad hoc
analysis that are actually

00:39:59.600 --> 00:40:01.930
done by the analysts, so they
can choose how they want to

00:40:01.930 --> 00:40:06.370
visualize it and then circulate
it to the teams.

00:40:06.370 --> 00:40:06.550
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:40:06.550 --> 00:40:09.470
I was actually wondering if
you can speak a little bit

00:40:09.470 --> 00:40:14.220
about the predictive models that
you were showing there.

00:40:14.220 --> 00:40:16.480
It wasn't clear, at least to me,
if that was something that

00:40:16.480 --> 00:40:18.940
was done within the App Engine,
or is that something

00:40:18.940 --> 00:40:20.550
that you're doing external?

00:40:20.550 --> 00:40:23.160
And what kind of tools are
you using for that?

00:40:23.160 --> 00:40:23.390
TOM NEWTON: Sure.

00:40:23.390 --> 00:40:26.300
So I kind of rushed through
that, I apologize.

00:40:26.300 --> 00:40:28.460
The Prediction API is
actually another

00:40:28.460 --> 00:40:30.870
API provided by Google.

00:40:30.870 --> 00:40:33.940
And we can talk a little bit--
oh, we have to get offstage.

00:40:33.940 --> 00:40:36.360
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:40:36.360 --> 00:40:38.255
TOM NEWTON: I'll come and have
a chat with you about that.

00:40:38.255 --> 00:40:38.840
AUDIENCE: OK, yeah.

00:40:38.840 --> 00:40:39.400
Sounds good.

00:40:39.400 --> 00:40:42.320
MATT MCNEILL: OK, are we
OK to have a chat at

00:40:42.320 --> 00:40:43.210
the booth maybe later?

00:40:43.210 --> 00:40:45.340
I'm just thinking that we're
probably timed out here.

00:40:45.340 --> 00:40:46.590
But thanks, Tom.

00:40:46.590 --> 00:40:47.850
Thanks, everyone, for coming.

00:40:47.850 --> 00:40:50.270
And if you have any questions,
please come by the booth.

00:40:50.270 --> 00:40:51.520
[APPLAUSE]
