1
00:00:00.070 --> 00:00:00.903
Ooh,

2
00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:05.230
the [inaudible],

3
00:00:07.870 --> 00:00:10.960
the [inaudible].

4
00:00:11.890 --> 00:00:12.480
<v 1>Oh,</v>

5
00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:16.360
<v 0>the [inaudible]</v>

6
00:00:17.050 --> 00:00:21.170
<v 1>1313 ladies and gentlemen,
that's a,
it's a number.</v>

7
00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:24.770
That's very important number.
Very important.
Tell me why.

8
00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:30.170
<v 2>Why 1330 is important.
Yes.
Well,
we got to 13 back to back.</v>

9
00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:35.200
So it doubles the normal potency of 13 which is already a mystical number,

10
00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:41.690
which terrifies people.
In the West you think it's unlucky,

11
00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:46.280
but in Tibetan Buddhism it's considered a very lucky and auspicious number.

12
00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:48.260
<v 1>Yeah.
I was staying at a hotel in Vegas.</v>

13
00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:53.350
They have no 13th floor and I don't think they add a fourth floor either.

14
00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:57.680
The fourth.
Yeah.
There's something about some cultures.

15
00:00:57.710 --> 00:00:59.990
The number four is unlucky.

16
00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:03.930
<v 2>How many cultures do we get to influence our buildings these days?</v>

17
00:01:03.931 --> 00:01:04.741
That's what's crazy.

18
00:01:04.741 --> 00:01:09.741
And what's crazier is it some point someone convinced a person,

19
00:01:09.901 --> 00:01:13.890
listen,
can we just not do a 13th floor?
And they listened to him.
I'm like,

20
00:01:13.891 --> 00:01:16.170
all right,
I guess we'll just go from 12 to 40

21
00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:21.080
<v 1>team.
Um,
shooter Jennings has it in a song.
When I check in to 14,</v>

22
00:01:21.081 --> 00:01:23.050
10 I know what room I'm really in.
Awe.

23
00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:26.670
<v 2>Ah,
that's cool.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Well are,
you know what,</v>

24
00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:31.590
that's what's so funny about it is because like that's the whole problem isn't

25
00:01:31.591 --> 00:01:31.710
it?

26
00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:36.570
It's like people want to pretend they're not in the 13th floor when they fucking

27
00:01:36.571 --> 00:01:40.520
know they are.
Right.
Instead of just acknowledging this is where I'm at.
No,
no,
no.

28
00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:43.500
We're in the 14 were 1414 called the 14th floor.

29
00:01:43.501 --> 00:01:47.400
Just call it and there'll be that dude.
I went when I was in college,

30
00:01:47.401 --> 00:01:49.440
we had to do service for like take,

31
00:01:49.441 --> 00:01:53.010
get the degree you had to go do like service overseas.

32
00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:58.400
So we went to India to Dharamsala and we taught the monks English and uh,

33
00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:04.250
I was sitting with like listening over hearing a monk in a conversation with

34
00:02:04.471 --> 00:02:08.430
someone teaching them English and the person's trying to explain to him how

35
00:02:08.431 --> 00:02:12.300
there isn't a 13th floor in buildings in the west.
And the monk was like,

36
00:02:12.301 --> 00:02:16.020
does it levitate?
Why is it missing?

37
00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:20.490
How do they deal?
Use genuinely perplex.
It was like a magical thing

38
00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:25.330
<v 1>in a culture that forces it citizens.</v>

39
00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:27.130
If they want to run the country,

40
00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:32.400
you have to believe in something that whether you're a Christian or whether

41
00:02:33.461 --> 00:02:38.290
you're a baptist or Mormon,

42
00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:39.520
whatever you,
whatever you are,

43
00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:45.930
there's certain parts of your religion that if you just don't want to analyze

44
00:02:45.941 --> 00:02:50.290
them,
just want to put them out on paper and say,
okay,
did this really happen?

45
00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:54.670
Did this guy really die and come back to life?
Did is everybody agreeing on this?

46
00:02:54.671 --> 00:02:59.050
[inaudible] everyone's agreeing that a Zombie,
a guy,

47
00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:02.650
a Zombie,
and he came back three days later and we're cool with that.

48
00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:07.120
This is a part of the doctrine,
so this is like a part of running the country.

49
00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:10.870
You,
I don't think you can be an atheist in this country.

50
00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:12.070
I don't think we would let you run.
It

51
00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:13.341
<v 2>can meet.
You have to,</v>

52
00:03:13.341 --> 00:03:17.900
I think you do have to have some affiliation with some religion or another

53
00:03:17.901 --> 00:03:21.350
problem.
Yeah.
Right now it seems to be like it needs to be Christianity.

54
00:03:21.351 --> 00:03:26.120
Like there needs to be like every president that has aligned themselves with,

55
00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:26.950
it's like

56
00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:29.530
<v 1>trapped in this,</v>

57
00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:32.500
this thing that you are when you're young,

58
00:03:32.710 --> 00:03:34.240
you know this thing you are when you're young,

59
00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:37.390
where you're looking at the people that are older than you.

60
00:03:37.570 --> 00:03:40.360
You're looking at society and you're like 16 you just starting to think,

61
00:03:40.361 --> 00:03:42.610
God damn,
I'll be graduating from high school soon.

62
00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:46.480
What am I going to do with my life?
You know,
it's you filled with so much angst.

63
00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:50.380
Yeah.
But you always think,
yeah,
this shit doesn't make any sense.

64
00:03:50.381 --> 00:03:55.240
But one day we'll,
and one day we'll be the grownups.

65
00:03:55.270 --> 00:03:59.980
Yeah.
And we'll be the ones that get to make the rules and we'll go,
hey,
this is,

66
00:04:00.050 --> 00:04:01.330
we're doing things all wrong.

67
00:04:01.331 --> 00:04:05.230
Folks were doing things out of momentum rather than out of logic.

68
00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:08.890
But that time never comes.
And then all of a sudden you're like,
you or I were,

69
00:04:08.891 --> 00:04:12.490
your middle aged were middle aged men.
I'm a 51 year old man.

70
00:04:12.491 --> 00:04:16.000
I'm 40 52 were middle aged.
If we're lucky,

71
00:04:16.450 --> 00:04:20.740
if we're super lucky,
reality,
we're closer to death.
Yeah,
for sure.
For sure.

72
00:04:21.100 --> 00:04:25.310
So,
and we're still trapped by this thing where you,

73
00:04:25.311 --> 00:04:29.710
you have to pretend,
you absolutely know,
look,
live your life.
Like Jesus is real.

74
00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:30.850
Live your life.

75
00:04:30.910 --> 00:04:35.910
Like you want to follow those tenants and you'll probably live a better life if

76
00:04:36.881 --> 00:04:39.610
you really follow the actual true tenants of Christianity.

77
00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:45.040
If you really want to believe that a guy came back to life and that only

78
00:04:45.041 --> 00:04:48.190
happened once and that you have to follow this book.
Yeah.

79
00:04:48.250 --> 00:04:51.940
If you don't follow this book that was clearly written and rewritten and fucked

80
00:04:51.941 --> 00:04:56.150
with by people and you know that people are known liars.
Yeah.
There's,

81
00:04:56.230 --> 00:04:58.840
why do we have court?
Because people lie.
What really happened?

82
00:04:58.870 --> 00:05:01.450
You have to fucking get a bunch of people to sit down and figure out what really

83
00:05:01.451 --> 00:05:04.500
happened.
Is this guy saying I didn't do anything,
your honor.
Yeah.

84
00:05:04.630 --> 00:05:09.230
And they got prints and DNA.
Yeah.
And in,

85
00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:11.500
in that world of known liars,

86
00:05:11.620 --> 00:05:16.510
we believe a crazy story that was written when people had no science.

87
00:05:16.511 --> 00:05:19.710
But we accept it because we think it makes the world a better place.
Yeah.

88
00:05:19.710 --> 00:05:23.730
<v 2>Man,
it's not.
And there's like so many levels of that where it's like,
yeah,</v>

89
00:05:23.731 --> 00:05:27.900
that's one obvious level that if you want to take Jesus literally,

90
00:05:27.901 --> 00:05:32.160
which is you have to in certain forms of Christianity,

91
00:05:32.490 --> 00:05:35.550
you're going to have to deal with some pretty severe cognitive dissonance.

92
00:05:35.551 --> 00:05:40.551
You'll be taught maybe to question your instincts but then go one step deeper

93
00:05:41.760 --> 00:05:44.730
and start thinking cause the real question is,
well what is real like,

94
00:05:44.731 --> 00:05:48.630
I mean the eye,
there's obvious shit that's clearly bullshit.
Yeah,
but wait,

95
00:05:48.660 --> 00:05:52.440
they then when you start going down you realize like you get to the point of the

96
00:05:52.441 --> 00:05:57.441
self and then you start realizing that the self in this Jesus that believes in

97
00:05:57.711 --> 00:06:00.530
are very similar in the sense that like,
you know,

98
00:06:00.531 --> 00:06:03.560
I don't say I believe in gravity.

99
00:06:03.830 --> 00:06:06.710
You would think I was crazy if I said it was to be a crazy thing to say,
look,

100
00:06:06.711 --> 00:06:11.180
you know I believe there's gravity.
There is gravity,
it's testable.
It works.

101
00:06:11.330 --> 00:06:14.000
But what do you always hear when people are like,
if you want to succeed,

102
00:06:14.001 --> 00:06:18.590
what do you do?
You believe in yourself and it's like,
wait,
what do you mean?

103
00:06:18.591 --> 00:06:22.940
Believe in yourself.
I am a south.
Why do I have to believe in it?
Right.

104
00:06:23.270 --> 00:06:24.103
So that's

105
00:06:24.460 --> 00:06:28.050
<v 1>it's a clunky way of seeing self doubt is crippling.
Yep.</v>

106
00:06:28.100 --> 00:06:32.840
<v 2>Well the self doubt,
self,
you know,
rejection.
I hate myself,</v>

107
00:06:32.841 --> 00:06:35.360
I love myself.
All these things have within it,

108
00:06:35.361 --> 00:06:40.010
this concept of the South and a lot of folks,
uh,

109
00:06:40.040 --> 00:06:44.210
have not spent much time really exploring like,
well what is the,

110
00:06:44.270 --> 00:06:48.890
what is the self like what is my particular self?
And uh,

111
00:06:49.220 --> 00:06:52.670
I think it kind of revise via via when we are Sasquatch hiring,

112
00:06:54.730 --> 00:06:59.030
you know,
the cell for the many people self is very similar to big foot.
Yeah.

113
00:06:59.090 --> 00:07:02.150
It's a thing that they imagined that there's signs up,

114
00:07:02.151 --> 00:07:06.140
but they've never really quite seen the big foot,
you know?
Right.
But you know,

115
00:07:06.170 --> 00:07:10.580
remember the feather and the trail.
It's a gift.
It means he likes you.
Yeah.

116
00:07:10.790 --> 00:07:11.640
They would think that SAS

117
00:07:11.720 --> 00:07:13.880
<v 1>squatters were taking and leaving gifts,</v>

118
00:07:14.060 --> 00:07:18.040
taking their gifts and leaving their own gifts.
Swapping gifts.
Yeah.
Yeah.

119
00:07:18.200 --> 00:07:19.980
And we believed it.
They believed,

120
00:07:20.030 --> 00:07:22.940
they believed that the same way people believe in a religion.
You know,

121
00:07:23.070 --> 00:07:26.240
I have a friend and she was a Mormon.
I've told this story before,

122
00:07:26.270 --> 00:07:30.530
so forgive me if you've heard it.
Um,
she was a Mormon,
but I think it's important.

123
00:07:30.680 --> 00:07:35.680
And she was a devout her whole life and then the family just fell out of it and

124
00:07:36.621 --> 00:07:39.860
then they started realizing like they started going into the history of it and

125
00:07:39.861 --> 00:07:41.540
then they started thinking it was preposterous.

126
00:07:41.541 --> 00:07:45.260
It was right around when book of Mormon was coming out to know that hilarious

127
00:07:45.261 --> 00:07:49.660
musical ends here.
It's great,
it's really good.
But she was really honest about,

128
00:07:49.670 --> 00:07:53.180
she was like,
the problem is like growing up in that fundamentalist background,

129
00:07:53.181 --> 00:07:58.181
it makes me very susceptible to like healers and like psychics and clairvoyants

130
00:07:58.881 --> 00:08:03.440
and bullshit,
our spiritual peoples.
She's like,
I get sucked into bullshit.

131
00:08:03.441 --> 00:08:06.070
And she was like almost kind of upset.
Yeah.
Well no,

132
00:08:06.080 --> 00:08:09.380
not almost like she was kind of upset but like perplexed.
Like,

133
00:08:09.381 --> 00:08:14.360
how do you rewire yourself when you've been trained to believe that a 14 year

134
00:08:14.361 --> 00:08:19.361
old boy in 1820 found golden tablets that contained the loss work of Jesus and

135
00:08:19.470 --> 00:08:23.160
then all them native Americans where the lost tribe of Israel.
I'm guy.

136
00:08:23.300 --> 00:08:27.170
I mean this is,
that's the story,
right?
14 year old boy,
he had a magic rock.

137
00:08:27.171 --> 00:08:28.350
He was the only one it could read it.
Yeah,

138
00:08:28.880 --> 00:08:32.780
<v 2>it's crazy.
She started looking into it and she is,
she's out.</v>

139
00:08:32.960 --> 00:08:35.960
Sean gone.
And that's sad too man.

140
00:08:35.961 --> 00:08:39.590
Because like if you t you could take some like basic tenants,

141
00:08:39.620 --> 00:08:44.360
which are true and not based on,
it kind of reminds me of like,
you know,

142
00:08:44.361 --> 00:08:49.340
you hear someone who's taken Iowasca any comes to you and he's got a profound

143
00:08:49.341 --> 00:08:53.030
message that came to him from some mythological creature.
A Dragon,

144
00:08:53.410 --> 00:08:58.000
a butterfly has told him some kind of profound fucking thing.
Yeah.

145
00:08:58.140 --> 00:09:01.350
And you realize,
oh,
the bubble machine of profundity.

146
00:09:01.650 --> 00:09:05.130
You've got a bubble machine for 13,
13 upset whenever we're talking about,

147
00:09:06.730 --> 00:09:10.950
let's keep it rolling.
The,
um,
yeah,
the uh,

148
00:09:11.400 --> 00:09:15.070
so you don't get caught up and popping them though when you,

149
00:09:15.340 --> 00:09:18.240
I know that's a problem of getting too high.
You're like done talking.

150
00:09:18.241 --> 00:09:21.150
What are we doing?
Let's just pop bubbles.
Let's let the bubbles fly.

151
00:09:22.320 --> 00:09:27.320
It's like for them to really like take in the basic wisdom they got from the

152
00:09:27.361 --> 00:09:30.870
mythological creature.
They needed a mythological creature.

153
00:09:30.871 --> 00:09:35.040
The mythological creature said something to them along the lines of you need to

154
00:09:35.280 --> 00:09:38.580
love yourself more.
You need to give more to your community,

155
00:09:38.581 --> 00:09:41.940
whatever the message is.
But if your Uber driver said that to you,

156
00:09:42.300 --> 00:09:46.500
it wouldn't get through because it wasn't like phosphorescent it didn't have

157
00:09:46.501 --> 00:09:50.190
multiple heads.
So similarly with these religions,

158
00:09:50.191 --> 00:09:55.191
what happens is you do get some real transcendent wisdom that's sort of timeless

159
00:09:55.350 --> 00:09:58.560
mixed in with it.
And then the people,
because they realize like,
oh my God,

160
00:09:58.561 --> 00:10:03.390
it was kind of a fairy tale.
They also reject the good stuff inside of it.

161
00:10:03.391 --> 00:10:08.250
And that to me is the big tragedy of any kind of fundamentalist literalist

162
00:10:08.251 --> 00:10:12.720
interpretation that's being forced on people is because within that is

163
00:10:12.721 --> 00:10:17.310
inevitably something great or it wouldn't be so viral like Christianity wouldn't

164
00:10:17.311 --> 00:10:21.990
be here right now if there wasn't a core thread in it that had a beautiful

165
00:10:21.991 --> 00:10:23.390
message in it and it makes me,
yeah,

166
00:10:23.410 --> 00:10:27.580
<v 3>well nicer people.
I actually had a really big conversation this weekend with a,</v>

167
00:10:27.581 --> 00:10:28.750
a very good friend about it,

168
00:10:28.780 --> 00:10:32.470
about another very good friend who is very religious and we were saying like,

169
00:10:32.500 --> 00:10:37.180
I think for some people it's an amazing framework and a guide to live your life.

170
00:10:37.210 --> 00:10:38.290
I really do believe that.

171
00:10:38.350 --> 00:10:42.760
I have several friends who are very devout Christians.
Yeah,

172
00:10:42.910 --> 00:10:47.170
it's beautiful and they,
they're the nicest people I know.
And Mormons,
by the way,

173
00:10:47.200 --> 00:10:49.210
I have friends that are Mormons still to this day.

174
00:10:49.360 --> 00:10:52.810
I have several friends that are Mormons and there are some of the nicest people

175
00:10:53.290 --> 00:10:56.200
and I don't care if they believe something that I don't believe in.
That's okay.

176
00:10:56.650 --> 00:11:00.550
It's okay.
It is okay.
But I mean,

177
00:11:01.560 --> 00:11:06.560
the idea that everyone is supposed to buy into stuff without questioning it is

178
00:11:07.331 --> 00:11:10.390
the reason why we are 51 year old,
16 year old

179
00:11:11.230 --> 00:11:13.180
<v 2>dude.
I agree.</v>

180
00:11:13.660 --> 00:11:16.960
And then there's the deeper symbolic shit.

181
00:11:16.990 --> 00:11:18.640
It seems to be encoded in Christianity,

182
00:11:18.670 --> 00:11:23.670
whether from people projecting their own understanding on a pretty wild symbol

183
00:11:24.071 --> 00:11:28.480
set or maybe it was intentional either way.
There's like a cool,
like,
you know,

184
00:11:28.481 --> 00:11:30.430
the,
uh,
if we talked about this,

185
00:11:30.431 --> 00:11:34.690
like if you take a cube and unfolded,

186
00:11:35.080 --> 00:11:36.670
it makes a crucifix.

187
00:11:36.760 --> 00:11:41.760
And like the cube represents pre big bang conditions and the crucifix represents

188
00:11:43.871 --> 00:11:47.260
past,
present,
and future intersecting with Aternity.

189
00:11:47.980 --> 00:11:51.070
<v 3>So if you have a,
a square,
oh,
I get it.
So the,
the length,</v>

190
00:11:51.071 --> 00:11:54.070
the height is twice the width.
Yeah.
That's,
Oh,
okay.

191
00:11:54.100 --> 00:11:57.610
<v 4>Maybe it unfolds into a crucifix for people that are annoyed with that sound.</v>

192
00:11:57.790 --> 00:12:00.790
It sounds like a pencil sharpening over and over and over again.
We're sorry.

193
00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:05.020
Sorry about that y'all.
But bubbles don't come free.
You need me to machine.

194
00:12:05.980 --> 00:12:10.030
We got to hire somebody,
hire some dude.
Just blow bubbles.

195
00:12:10.680 --> 00:12:12.760
What do you do?
I blow bubbles on the jre,
Bro.

196
00:12:14.960 --> 00:12:18.430
I'm like fucking manly wrestler dude.

197
00:12:19.540 --> 00:12:22.060
Do that man,
do that.

198
00:12:22.170 --> 00:12:25.810
You have different people come in and blow bubbles and occasionally they

199
00:12:25.900 --> 00:12:28.480
chairman.
Hey,
I'm going to be on the Jerry next week.
What are you doing?

200
00:12:28.481 --> 00:12:31.540
I'm blowing bubbles.
Oh cool.
You're the bubble blower for the week.

201
00:12:31.810 --> 00:12:35.620
You could start something that became like,
that's just what people do.
It's like,

202
00:12:35.621 --> 00:12:39.550
did you get your bubble man yet?
Yeah.
I'm a classic bubble man.

203
00:12:39.580 --> 00:12:42.960
I know how to do it.
The new guys,
they're too loud when they blow.
Well,

204
00:12:43.590 --> 00:12:46.720
did Johnny Carson was Ed Mcmahon the first side kick.

205
00:12:48.070 --> 00:12:48.710
<v 5>Well</v>

206
00:12:48.710 --> 00:12:50.690
<v 4>what did,
did Jack Paar have a sidekick?</v>

207
00:12:51.030 --> 00:12:51.863
<v 5>I Dunno.</v>

208
00:12:52.520 --> 00:12:55.220
<v 4>Yeah.
Well how many options were before that?
That Sullivan and well,</v>

209
00:12:55.221 --> 00:12:59.990
there was the other guy,
Steve Allen.
I think Steve Allen might've been the first.

210
00:13:01.070 --> 00:13:03.140
Was he the first tonight show?
The second tonight show.

211
00:13:03.750 --> 00:13:04.583
<v 5>Okay.</v>

212
00:13:05.110 --> 00:13:05.943
<v 4>Yeah,</v>

213
00:13:05.950 --> 00:13:10.430
but I think that Ed Mcmahon was probably the first sidekick and once they had a

214
00:13:10.470 --> 00:13:14.930
queue,
people like,
oh yeah,
you need it,
sidekick.

215
00:13:15.680 --> 00:13:19.480
You need somebody to play that part because you can bounce stuff off of him.

216
00:13:19.481 --> 00:13:24.180
It's so great.
The reaction.
So much better than a laugh track.
Yeah,

217
00:13:24.760 --> 00:13:28.690
yeah,
yeah.
So Christianity,
it's on one level.

218
00:13:28.790 --> 00:13:32.680
Are you fucking kidding me?
It's like an I,
this nerdy part of me,
man.

219
00:13:32.681 --> 00:13:36.220
When you were doing that,
Jesus is a Zombie thing.
I would really want to be like,

220
00:13:36.221 --> 00:13:39.020
well technically not a Zombie.
No.

221
00:13:39.030 --> 00:13:41.950
As long as he was buried,
right.

222
00:13:41.951 --> 00:13:45.430
Like it's not like he did come back to life,
but through,
this is a,

223
00:13:45.470 --> 00:13:49.860
there's a move in Jujitsu called the Zombie Zombie is,

224
00:13:49.910 --> 00:13:53.230
is when you're in mission control and you trying to get an under hook,

225
00:13:53.260 --> 00:13:56.980
you push your hand through like a Zombie rising through the ground.

226
00:13:57.460 --> 00:14:01.010
So zombies get buried.
Yeah.
But I guess,
you know,
I,

227
00:14:01.011 --> 00:14:04.840
I don't want to get into like comparable.
Why not?
Let's break it up.
So what is,

228
00:14:04.841 --> 00:14:05.710
is that like when,

229
00:14:05.711 --> 00:14:09.150
when is it just a person who's like severely disabled and when it,

230
00:14:09.151 --> 00:14:12.910
is it a Zombie?
Well,
you know what I mean?
Like cause it,
well they're dead.

231
00:14:13.300 --> 00:14:16.840
They're dead.
They die.
Their heart stops beating.
The doctor says they're dead.

232
00:14:16.870 --> 00:14:20.000
You would be like a complete asshole if you're like,
they have this,

233
00:14:20.001 --> 00:14:21.730
they have the same intelligence as humans.

234
00:14:21.731 --> 00:14:25.090
There clearly there's some brain damage has happened to a Zombie.
Right?

235
00:14:25.091 --> 00:14:28.360
It's a most movies.
It's a person with brain damage.

236
00:14:28.361 --> 00:14:32.680
Is there any Zombie movies for their smart?
I've net.
That's just every movie.

237
00:14:33.340 --> 00:14:37.690
Yeah.
But I guarantee like there's,
there's zombies movies where they run fast.

238
00:14:37.691 --> 00:14:41.530
That was an evolution of the Zombie.
It started running.
The Zombie became like,

239
00:14:41.531 --> 00:14:44.440
kind of like hyper violent and then,
but still,

240
00:14:44.441 --> 00:14:48.050
I guess what they all have in common is that they're technically their dead.

241
00:14:48.051 --> 00:14:50.970
And this is,
they don't have a heartbeat.
They're not dead like a biologist.

242
00:14:51.050 --> 00:14:52.340
Be like,
the Zombie is alive.

243
00:14:52.370 --> 00:14:52.610
<v 2>Right.</v>

244
00:14:52.610 --> 00:14:55.970
It's just like a fungus now or something running through a parasite inside of
it,

245
00:14:55.971 --> 00:14:59.240
essentially.
Yeah.
It's some kind of fungus.
Rabies.
Yeah.

246
00:14:59.241 --> 00:15:02.300
Some new rabies or gut biome problem.

247
00:15:02.560 --> 00:15:06.100
<v 1>What was the,
the 28 days later?
Is that it?
Yeah.</v>

248
00:15:07.030 --> 00:15:10.300
That was the first one when they ran.
Yeah.
And that was the scary was good.

249
00:15:10.330 --> 00:15:13.930
Fucking awesome.
Running Zombie was so good.
So good.

250
00:15:14.080 --> 00:15:15.850
And because it was also shaky,

251
00:15:16.090 --> 00:15:19.780
like when the zombies were chasing after you'd fucking panic because the screen

252
00:15:19.781 --> 00:15:21.340
was shaking when it was running at you.

253
00:15:21.710 --> 00:15:24.310
They were the first like Berzerker Zombie,

254
00:15:25.190 --> 00:15:29.360
<v 2>you know man,
all this gut buy him stuff that we're hearing now.
Like the,</v>

255
00:15:29.920 --> 00:15:32.060
the study I just read about this study today,

256
00:15:32.061 --> 00:15:36.140
like they found out that what the gut biome,
what you're feeding your,

257
00:15:36.950 --> 00:15:39.230
your baby affects their,
like they,

258
00:15:39.330 --> 00:15:42.920
there seems to be a correlation between their gut biome and the way they act

259
00:15:43.310 --> 00:15:47.440
when they're like five or something.
There are two years old or something.
Sure.

260
00:15:47.510 --> 00:15:49.400
Dude.
And the autism link,

261
00:15:49.430 --> 00:15:52.040
you know where they're saying they think autism might be related to like,

262
00:15:52.070 --> 00:15:55.350
well who's saying that?
Jamie,
would you mind pulling that up for us?

263
00:15:55.420 --> 00:16:00.100
<v 1>There's a guy named Dr Peter Hotez and he was on the podcast and he is a,</v>

264
00:16:00.101 --> 00:16:01.970
is an expert in um,

265
00:16:02.050 --> 00:16:06.160
autism and vaccines and diseases and foreign countries,

266
00:16:06.730 --> 00:16:10.190
particularly tropical diseases in warm,
moist climate diseases.

267
00:16:10.720 --> 00:16:14.980
And he was talking about how they've got it narrowed down to five environmental

268
00:16:14.981 --> 00:16:19.981
factors that happen during the womb that they think possibly contribute to

269
00:16:21.100 --> 00:16:22.050
autism.
Yeah.

270
00:16:22.090 --> 00:16:26.360
But they don't think that it comes from something that happens later.
Huh.

271
00:16:27.460 --> 00:16:29.830
This is current science according to him.

272
00:16:29.831 --> 00:16:33.010
Obviously I don't know what I'm talking about.
Like for sure.

273
00:16:33.250 --> 00:16:34.690
I'm not a biologist at all.

274
00:16:34.780 --> 00:16:38.610
<v 2>People looking at us are probably like,
how did these scientists not know this?</v>

275
00:16:38.850 --> 00:16:42.470
<v 1>Barely be able to say those words in order.
Yeah.</v>

276
00:16:42.540 --> 00:16:47.490
Pretend like I know what they mean.
But I,
I listen to experts.
Um,

277
00:16:47.640 --> 00:16:48.690
the mother's microbiome,

278
00:16:48.691 --> 00:16:51.360
that collection of microscopic organisms that lives inside of us as a key

279
00:16:51.361 --> 00:16:55.020
contributor to the risk of autism.
Some that might be one of the factors.

280
00:16:55.021 --> 00:16:59.790
So it's during the womb and neurodevelopmental disorders in offspring.
Well,

281
00:16:59.850 --> 00:17:04.800
it would make sense that if your body's not getting the proper nutrition and

282
00:17:04.801 --> 00:17:05.880
your body is not healthy,

283
00:17:06.270 --> 00:17:09.930
that whatever's going on inside of you is not going to be in the best

284
00:17:09.931 --> 00:17:14.040
environment for a baby to reach 100% health.

285
00:17:14.260 --> 00:17:18.510
Just makes sense.
If you're eating terrible while you're pregnant,

286
00:17:18.540 --> 00:17:20.130
it's not going to be good for the kid.

287
00:17:20.160 --> 00:17:24.480
But if you're eating really well and you're relaxing and taking care of
yourself,

288
00:17:24.690 --> 00:17:27.900
it's probably better for the kid.
I mean,
this seems like obvious.

289
00:17:27.901 --> 00:17:30.020
It doesn't seem to make any sense that that wouldn't

290
00:17:30.320 --> 00:17:34.050
<v 2>case.
I think the weird part of it,
to me,</v>

291
00:17:34.480 --> 00:17:39.480
it's this runs into like I ideas of free well or like autonomy in the sense that

292
00:17:40.850 --> 00:17:41.610
how,

293
00:17:41.610 --> 00:17:46.610
how much is the gut and the neurons in the gut and the neurons in the heart,

294
00:17:49.260 --> 00:17:50.340
all the interactions

295
00:17:50.340 --> 00:17:55.340
<v 6>they're having with things that have different DNA than us affecting what we do</v>

296
00:17:55.950 --> 00:17:58.410
and was like,
there you go.
Long.

297
00:17:58.530 --> 00:18:02.880
That's so weird because he contributes to depression.
Yeah.
Yeah.

298
00:18:02.910 --> 00:18:06.480
And it contributes to what else?
Autism.

299
00:18:06.481 --> 00:18:10.470
What other behaviors or in other words are we just essentially being driven

300
00:18:10.471 --> 00:18:15.471
around by some kind of strange microscopic hive of creatures living in our shit

301
00:18:17.880 --> 00:18:19.560
<v 1>in some way.
Yeah.
Brian,
you know,</v>

302
00:18:19.561 --> 00:18:24.561
Brian Cowen had a pretty bad case of like of a psoriasis kept coming back nasty,

303
00:18:26.850 --> 00:18:29.580
really bothered him,
tried a bunch of stuff,
couldn't get it fixed.

304
00:18:29.940 --> 00:18:32.160
Went to one doctor who's a specialist,

305
00:18:32.220 --> 00:18:36.990
a specialist in Gut biome and its connection to autoimmune disorders and got it

306
00:18:36.991 --> 00:18:37.824
fixed.
Him Up.

307
00:18:38.430 --> 00:18:43.430
Just changed up is probiotics like what he's taking prebiotics and probiotics

308
00:18:44.400 --> 00:18:46.140
gave him some like heavy duty Shit.

309
00:18:46.350 --> 00:18:50.130
I forget exactly what he said but it fixed it and it was basically something

310
00:18:50.131 --> 00:18:53.970
going on in his gut biome and that can be affected by stress.
Yeah.

311
00:18:54.830 --> 00:18:56.490
Can Be affected by lack of sleep.

312
00:18:56.550 --> 00:18:58.740
There's all sorts of stuff that goes on in your body.

313
00:18:58.741 --> 00:19:03.741
Like we have to think of ourselves as a s like a super organism,

314
00:19:04.050 --> 00:19:07.380
like essentially like an ecosystem.
We have to think of ourselves as like,

315
00:19:07.920 --> 00:19:11.970
you think of yourself as you,
hey,
it's me,
it's Joe,
it's Dunkin,
we're talking,

316
00:19:11.971 --> 00:19:13.410
we're friends.
Hey what's up buddy?

317
00:19:13.800 --> 00:19:17.580
But really what we are is the keepers of the realm.
Okay.

318
00:19:17.581 --> 00:19:21.030
We've got a whole realm of things living inside of our body and we're feeding it

319
00:19:21.031 --> 00:19:25.040
Twinkies.
And it's freaking out.
It's like you fucking moron you.

320
00:19:25.050 --> 00:19:28.020
But it like would,
it feels like when Twinkies going my face,

321
00:19:28.640 --> 00:19:32.100
I see your fucking knees hurt all the time.
Your back is killing you.

322
00:19:32.101 --> 00:19:35.370
You have all these inflammation problems getting sits and you're 40 years old.

323
00:19:35.371 --> 00:19:38.010
Like what the fuck it's cause you're eating dog shit man.

324
00:19:38.160 --> 00:19:41.400
You're not giving your body anything good.
You're the keeper of the realm.

325
00:19:41.580 --> 00:19:46.530
<v 6>And also this is sounds like I've been thinking about is like how much data</v>

326
00:19:46.531 --> 00:19:49.050
we're eating,
which is equivalent to Twinkies.

327
00:19:49.051 --> 00:19:52.200
It's like you eat a bunch of Twinkies,
your body starts hurting,

328
00:19:52.440 --> 00:19:56.450
then you're just slurping up whatever the fuck on the phone.
Right.
Which I,

329
00:19:56.460 --> 00:19:59.640
by the way,
I'm talking about me.
This is what I do.
I,
you know,

330
00:19:59.641 --> 00:20:03.840
my bouncing around from like drudge report to Huffington report to reddit

331
00:20:03.841 --> 00:20:07.440
conspiracy to read it.
What the fuck?
Zip,
Papi,

332
00:20:07.470 --> 00:20:10.860
how long before you're looking at like a zit popping video and then that takes

333
00:20:10.861 --> 00:20:15.600
you down into a place of like,
oh,
let's just move to animals,
cysts.
And then boom,

334
00:20:15.630 --> 00:20:17.730
and then you fall asleep.
You wake up screaming.
Yep.

335
00:20:17.820 --> 00:20:21.570
And that's the equivalent of getting white gas isn't it for meeting like a huge

336
00:20:21.571 --> 00:20:24.270
Taco bell meal and we set a farting.

337
00:20:24.271 --> 00:20:27.860
You're just just screaming in the middle of the night cause you dreamed a Colt

338
00:20:27.861 --> 00:20:31.680
was dragging you into the forest.
It's like this is to me,

339
00:20:31.920 --> 00:20:36.920
we seem to have not quite acknowledged that data is as much of is like a food

340
00:20:37.310 --> 00:20:42.310
and that so much of the weirdness that is people are showing these like strange

341
00:20:42.901 --> 00:20:43.800
behaviors.

342
00:20:44.040 --> 00:20:48.280
It's gotta be because of the crazy shit they're sucking their optic nerves.

343
00:20:48.280 --> 00:20:48.791
<v 1>Right?
It is.</v>

344
00:20:48.791 --> 00:20:53.791
It's also the ability to affect people vague very rapidly or the to get a

345
00:20:54.011 --> 00:20:57.910
reaction from someone positive or negative.
People are so addicted to that.

346
00:20:58.210 --> 00:21:02.830
I watch people getting these Twitter beefs back and forth and he fucking smart

347
00:21:02.831 --> 00:21:03.664
people.
Man.

348
00:21:03.850 --> 00:21:07.570
A smart friend of mine who I respect greatly tried to get me to retweet

349
00:21:07.571 --> 00:21:09.430
something mean that he was saying to someone else.
I'm like,

350
00:21:09.431 --> 00:21:13.000
get the fuck out of here.
Like why are you,
what are you doing?
Yeah.

351
00:21:13.120 --> 00:21:14.440
Like what are you doing with your time?

352
00:21:14.800 --> 00:21:18.850
We get the one thing that I've done over the last week,

353
00:21:18.851 --> 00:21:22.720
we did a podcast with Bert and Tom and Ari and we all looked at the amount of

354
00:21:22.721 --> 00:21:26.200
screen time we put on our phone cause our,
I was proposing no smartphones.
Yeah.

355
00:21:27.160 --> 00:21:31.720
Um,
my phone fucking screentime was like four hours for a day.
I was like,
what?

356
00:21:31.990 --> 00:21:32.341
And I'm,

357
00:21:32.341 --> 00:21:36.820
I'll lie to myself and I solo most Lhotse email and taking care of business.

358
00:21:37.050 --> 00:21:39.550
Yeah.
Most of it is going through Google news feed,

359
00:21:39.551 --> 00:21:42.220
looking for crazy stories of like animal attacks.

360
00:21:44.220 --> 00:21:45.580
What is looking at,
man,

361
00:21:46.120 --> 00:21:49.210
I watched a video today of a guy ride his dirt bike and a bear's chasing him.

362
00:21:49.211 --> 00:21:51.920
I'm like,
what in the fuck?
What is happening?

363
00:21:52.010 --> 00:21:56.200
<v 2>Look man,
I don't want to try to like,
uh,
enable your addiction.</v>

364
00:21:56.460 --> 00:22:00.610
But honestly I think the Internet has come to depend on your wild animal attack

365
00:22:00.820 --> 00:22:01.510
videos.

366
00:22:01.510 --> 00:22:06.400
Like you have kind of become like a news outlet for the best wild animal attack.

367
00:22:06.401 --> 00:22:09.670
People need to know,
people need to see this shit man.
Like we don't know.

368
00:22:09.671 --> 00:22:14.410
I've never seen a vulture fight or rabbit or out of people do have a very weird

369
00:22:14.790 --> 00:22:19.230
<v 1>idea of what animals are and I think that the average person,</v>

370
00:22:19.231 --> 00:22:22.050
I'm certainly no expert,
but amongst the average person,

371
00:22:22.320 --> 00:22:27.320
I have a much better understanding of wildlife because I'm out in the wild.

372
00:22:27.720 --> 00:22:32.220
Yeah,
several times a year hunting.
It's a different world.
It's a different world.

373
00:22:32.221 --> 00:22:33.054
I'm no expert,

374
00:22:33.270 --> 00:22:38.270
but my perception of it is as someone who sees wildlife in the wild,

375
00:22:39.361 --> 00:22:42.150
they see dead ones that other ones have killed.

376
00:22:42.330 --> 00:22:46.250
We came across a calf that had been ripped apart by wolves.
I mean we,

377
00:22:46.251 --> 00:22:49.920
we see stuff and you realize what that is,

378
00:22:50.880 --> 00:22:53.400
what that,
what that fucking forest really is.

379
00:22:53.730 --> 00:22:58.730
It's this competing ecosystem of life and it's going on all the time and there's

380
00:22:58.921 --> 00:23:02.760
big things jacking smaller things and there's birds snatching things off the

381
00:23:02.761 --> 00:23:07.440
ground and snatch and other birds out of trees and it's happening all the time

382
00:23:07.441 --> 00:23:11.250
and it's magic and you have to have it that way because otherwise the whole

383
00:23:11.251 --> 00:23:13.020
population of the plant would be overrun.

384
00:23:13.260 --> 00:23:17.970
You have to have your sorrow of watching the bear tear apart the font.

385
00:23:18.030 --> 00:23:21.900
That has to happen because if it didn't happen,
you'd have too many fonts.

386
00:23:21.930 --> 00:23:23.690
They'd be everywhere.
You'd have too many deer.
Yeah,

387
00:23:23.910 --> 00:23:27.300
and you have to have someone who can take care of the bears.
Otherwise,

388
00:23:27.301 --> 00:23:29.430
the bears were overrun the city where the humans live,

389
00:23:29.610 --> 00:23:32.520
and we need to think about that and people don't want to because they don't want

390
00:23:32.521 --> 00:23:36.120
to shoot Yogi.
They don't want to shoot Yogi and booboo.
They're our friends.

391
00:23:36.240 --> 00:23:39.300
This is a teddy bear.
I grew up with a bear.
You don't know what a bear is.

392
00:23:39.420 --> 00:23:43.230
I've seen a bear in the wild.
When you see the bear in the wild,
you like,
oh,

393
00:23:43.380 --> 00:23:45.710
you're,
you don't give a fuck about me.

394
00:23:45.920 --> 00:23:50.540
You're some weird heartless beast that is majestic looking.
Yeah.

395
00:23:50.570 --> 00:23:54.320
Who runs around eating moose and deer babies.

396
00:23:54.560 --> 00:23:55.880
That's what your deal is.

397
00:23:56.150 --> 00:24:00.410
You eat grass and berries and you'd like to lay around your fucking cool as
shit.

398
00:24:00.650 --> 00:24:03.320
It's a cool ass animal.
Yeah.
It doesn't mean you hate it,

399
00:24:03.321 --> 00:24:06.800
but you've got to understand what the fuck it is.
It's not like this.
Ideally,

400
00:24:06.801 --> 00:24:11.330
people don't want,
um,
people to hunt bears in certain places.

401
00:24:11.331 --> 00:24:13.430
Like particularly like,
uh,
they're,
they're,

402
00:24:13.460 --> 00:24:16.520
they're trying to regulate the size of a,

403
00:24:16.700 --> 00:24:19.700
the amount of grizzly bears in certain parts of the country.
They're like,
hey,
we,

404
00:24:19.970 --> 00:24:24.240
we need to keep a handle on this.
Like the couple people get mauled,
you know,

405
00:24:24.241 --> 00:24:26.930
but people start walking through Yellowstone and get attacked.

406
00:24:26.931 --> 00:24:30.140
It happens like a little bit more rapidly.
The numbers get to a certain,

407
00:24:30.290 --> 00:24:32.450
I think they're like,
these things have no fear of people.

408
00:24:32.660 --> 00:24:37.310
Like we could actually help the population if they hand out bear tags and people

409
00:24:37.311 --> 00:24:40.940
start freaking out.
You can't kill the bears.
You can't kill the bears,

410
00:24:41.240 --> 00:24:42.320
don't you kill the bed.

411
00:24:42.350 --> 00:24:44.720
There's a reason why there's no fucking bears in California.

412
00:24:44.721 --> 00:24:49.100
Dunkin only black bears there are fucking state flag has a grizzly bear on it.

413
00:24:49.220 --> 00:24:52.340
Did you ever notice that?
Yeah.
Yeah.
The state flags a grizzly bear.

414
00:24:52.370 --> 00:24:55.820
They earn radicating all the grizzly bears because they were eating people.

415
00:24:56.120 --> 00:25:00.020
So in the fucking 18 hundreds,
dude,
there's a town,

416
00:25:00.021 --> 00:25:03.290
I think it's called Levesque,
I think it's called Levesque.

417
00:25:03.740 --> 00:25:07.780
It's out near like on the way to Bakersfield.
Yeah.
Lubeck.
Lubeck,

418
00:25:07.790 --> 00:25:08.950
I think it's called Le Bec.

419
00:25:09.410 --> 00:25:13.040
It's a town named after the last dude that got killed by a grizzly bear in

420
00:25:13.041 --> 00:25:14.180
California.
Yeah.

421
00:25:14.300 --> 00:25:18.500
And to investigate this thing just exuded his body and his legs were fucking

422
00:25:18.501 --> 00:25:22.130
ripped apart,
like is,
you know,
needs were snapped in half and shit.

423
00:25:22.160 --> 00:25:23.650
You have to destroy this tape.

424
00:25:23.730 --> 00:25:27.140
I get torn apart by a bear and they killed the bear and they buried him and that

425
00:25:27.141 --> 00:25:30.290
was the last bear.
There was the last bear attack.
They killed all the bears.

426
00:25:30.410 --> 00:25:32.660
The reason why they killed all the bears,
because that's what you have.

427
00:25:32.690 --> 00:25:36.320
Do you fuck?
Do you want to be able to walk to your car?
Yeah.
See you don't,

428
00:25:36.410 --> 00:25:40.760
you don't want bears in Santa Monica.
Okay.
Shut up.
Just shut up.
We do.

429
00:25:40.940 --> 00:25:45.410
We're going into their territory,
man.
They'll come into yours too.
Okay.
Stop.

430
00:25:45.440 --> 00:25:48.650
Don't be silly.
We definitely shouldn't kill all the bears.
Push a kill off.

431
00:25:48.651 --> 00:25:52.660
You should definitely kill some.
She kills some wolves to,
I just,

432
00:25:52.860 --> 00:25:56.670
<v 2>yeah,
we have to keep everything alive.
I'm going to bring back to your deck dose.</v>

433
00:25:56.730 --> 00:26:00.720
I wouldn't mind that snatching people right off of cars.
Oh,
come on.

434
00:26:00.750 --> 00:26:03.960
They could be controlled.
Come on.
They can be controlled.
Put them in a,

435
00:26:04.260 --> 00:26:07.290
some kind of domed,
I don't know.
It paddle down.

436
00:26:07.350 --> 00:26:10.200
We never knew there were bulletproof ring them back.
Fuck it.

437
00:26:10.230 --> 00:26:13.320
People shoot down on bullets.
Just bounce him down.
Hitting people on the ground

438
00:26:15.350 --> 00:26:19.710
if love skin.
It's the what,
you know,
I saw something,

439
00:26:20.040 --> 00:26:23.520
you know your podcast,
it's like everywhere now.

440
00:26:23.550 --> 00:26:26.130
It's like dandelions every year.
You can't,
anyway,

441
00:26:26.131 --> 00:26:31.131
I'm always getting suggested videos from your podcast and I saw one,

442
00:26:31.560 --> 00:26:36.390
cause I've been cutting down my meat consumption.
Good for you.
And uh,

443
00:26:36.420 --> 00:26:39.180
but that doesn't mean I don't eat meat.
I just want to cut it down a little bit.

444
00:26:39.240 --> 00:26:40.073
And uh,

445
00:26:41.820 --> 00:26:43.980
<v 1>and I have been feeling</v>

446
00:26:44.390 --> 00:26:48.600
<v 2>kind of enjoyable from time to time,
sense of,
you know,</v>

447
00:26:48.601 --> 00:26:50.880
that I don't know if you let yourself do this,
you probably don't.

448
00:26:50.881 --> 00:26:53.760
But that feeling of like kind of bullshit,

449
00:26:54.510 --> 00:26:56.310
like I'm a little better now.

450
00:26:57.150 --> 00:27:00.380
A better of a person that was really like I was kind of wasn't like overt,

451
00:27:00.390 --> 00:27:02.970
it wasn't like hyper obnoxious,
you know,

452
00:27:03.520 --> 00:27:05.160
but just the kind of sense of like I did it,

453
00:27:05.190 --> 00:27:09.150
I can cut down my beef consumption and I meeting,
you know,

454
00:27:09.810 --> 00:27:12.750
I mean,
you know,
a cheese here and there and anyway,

455
00:27:12.960 --> 00:27:15.750
this video popped up and it's some guests,

456
00:27:15.751 --> 00:27:19.590
I don't know who it was talking about the number of animals that die in a bean

457
00:27:19.591 --> 00:27:22.770
field,
like any bean field that you see.
Yeah.

458
00:27:23.010 --> 00:27:27.440
So many animals just ground up and murdered and uh,

459
00:27:27.650 --> 00:27:30.920
and it was great cause I realized like,
Oh of course.
Yeah.
Right.
You,

460
00:27:31.320 --> 00:27:36.090
the trick I was trying to play on myself is the same.
It's the 13th floor shit.

461
00:27:36.120 --> 00:27:40.740
It's like I want the world to look like a Disney film.

462
00:27:40.900 --> 00:27:43.820
<v 1>It's a bit,
it's a bit of a copout even saying that,
my,
my,</v>

463
00:27:43.821 --> 00:27:46.730
my saying that because the reality is there's another solution.

464
00:27:46.731 --> 00:27:50.900
The solution is organic gardening,
right.
So you can organically garden.

465
00:27:50.901 --> 00:27:54.440
If you get a plot of land and get some friends together,

466
00:27:54.590 --> 00:27:57.150
you can all grow enough vegetables.
So you'd have to take place in la,

467
00:27:57.200 --> 00:28:01.340
which lot with large scale agriculture or if you're dealing rather with large

468
00:28:01.341 --> 00:28:03.350
scale agriculture.
That's the problem.

469
00:28:03.351 --> 00:28:07.790
The problem is we have to feed in just in La alone,
the greater Los Angeles area.

470
00:28:07.791 --> 00:28:11.060
What is it like 20 million something people that's so many goddamn people and no

471
00:28:11.061 --> 00:28:14.420
one's grown anything other than than weed.
So what do we have?
Do we have,

472
00:28:14.421 --> 00:28:17.180
we have someone else to grow this fucking food for us.
So they have to do it.

473
00:28:17.181 --> 00:28:19.560
Large scale.
Yeah,
and when they do it large scale,

474
00:28:19.640 --> 00:28:23.510
it involves combines and those fucking things are indiscriminate.

475
00:28:23.720 --> 00:28:26.540
They're just chewing up the ground and things get caught up in it.

476
00:28:26.541 --> 00:28:30.740
And that's why when they clean fields,
when they pick whatever the growing,

477
00:28:30.950 --> 00:28:34.370
you'll see vultures after they run the combine and see vultures circle in the

478
00:28:34.371 --> 00:28:39.170
fields because they know rabbits and rats.
Jesus man,
all kinds of bugs.

479
00:28:39.200 --> 00:28:41.840
I mean any kind of,
I mean I don't know if you care about bugs,
which is,

480
00:28:41.841 --> 00:28:45.530
that's a weird thing,
right?
It's like vegans,
we'll get to this,
some vegans,

481
00:28:45.531 --> 00:28:48.560
we'll get to this like line where they're like,
yeah,
but that's a mosquito.

482
00:28:49.070 --> 00:28:51.680
Oh fuck mosquitoes.
Yeah,
they,
they have malaria.
You know,

483
00:28:51.681 --> 00:28:55.400
you get to like a life form ethical boundaries.

484
00:28:55.480 --> 00:28:57.060
We can't relate to a road.

485
00:28:57.470 --> 00:29:02.470
<v 2>Also the hilarious thing when it comes to assigning levels of sentience and then</v>

486
00:29:03.440 --> 00:29:06.260
based on that deciding if you should eat something or not,

487
00:29:06.650 --> 00:29:10.580
you run into like a lot of weird problems,
which is like number one,

488
00:29:10.581 --> 00:29:15.581
you're assuming a lot just because they don't have this sort of nervous system

489
00:29:15.801 --> 00:29:17.060
you have.
I mean,
and who knows,

490
00:29:17.061 --> 00:29:20.750
we project most of everything we are into the world and we don't really know

491
00:29:20.751 --> 00:29:21.650
what the phenomena is.

492
00:29:21.651 --> 00:29:26.651
But I've saw some like video of a little of an ant taking care of the ants baby.

493
00:29:28.100 --> 00:29:32.030
And I don't know if you've probably heard about how trees communicate with the

494
00:29:32.630 --> 00:29:37.490
uh,
mycelium.
Yes.
And like how they'll send nutrients to their children.

495
00:29:37.690 --> 00:29:40.610
Yeah.
And then so then you start running into I think,

496
00:29:40.611 --> 00:29:42.100
which is a really fascinating problem,

497
00:29:42.100 --> 00:29:47.100
<v 6>which is what if it's all alive and Cynthia and feeling for real?</v>

498
00:29:47.711 --> 00:29:51.880
What if the there is throughout the entire universe,

499
00:29:51.881 --> 00:29:56.881
just as [inaudible] field of consciousness that is interacting with matter in a

500
00:29:57.281 --> 00:30:02.281
way that it produces what we call life and that life is feeling terror love

501
00:30:03.851 --> 00:30:05.950
maybe in different ways than we would understand it,
but it's

502
00:30:06.020 --> 00:30:07.280
<v 1>still there.
You know,
there's,</v>

503
00:30:07.310 --> 00:30:11.660
that's a really under consideration by legitimate scientists and fracked,
um,

504
00:30:11.690 --> 00:30:14.140
Sam Harris,
his wife just wrote a book about that.
Oh really?

505
00:30:14.160 --> 00:30:15.280
It's one of the subjects of,

506
00:30:15.330 --> 00:30:19.070
it's called conscious and conscious or consciousness.
Sorry,

507
00:30:19.220 --> 00:30:20.690
I don't remember which.
I haven't read it yet,

508
00:30:20.691 --> 00:30:25.100
but I heard them talk about it on his podcast and the concept that used to be

509
00:30:25.101 --> 00:30:29.550
like super woo woo was what if everything has consciousness?
Yeah.

510
00:30:29.620 --> 00:30:33.890
What if everything had,
but it just can't move.
We can't express itself,

511
00:30:33.891 --> 00:30:35.120
can't change its environment.

512
00:30:35.240 --> 00:30:39.500
It's limited just like we can't fly and we can't swim underwater and breathe

513
00:30:39.501 --> 00:30:42.140
water.
Like we were limited in our physical abilities.

514
00:30:42.320 --> 00:30:45.260
But we assume that whatever limitations,
so we have like,
this is where it ends.

515
00:30:45.261 --> 00:30:47.690
This is where the buck stops here.
Yeah.
Like everything that doesn't move,

516
00:30:47.691 --> 00:30:49.520
it's gotta be stupid yet.
But it might not be,

517
00:30:49.670 --> 00:30:52.640
which is one of the reasons why nobody wants to buy a house after someone's been

518
00:30:52.641 --> 00:30:55.540
killed in it.
Right.
Like what if that house routines memory,

519
00:30:55.700 --> 00:30:58.730
that was something that Rupert Sheldrake proposed a long time ago.
You know,

520
00:30:58.731 --> 00:30:59.564
he's got that,

521
00:30:59.990 --> 00:31:04.280
what does that very strange theory where everything is connect morphic resonance

522
00:31:04.310 --> 00:31:06.140
I things from theory of morphic resonance.

523
00:31:06.860 --> 00:31:11.810
He's a fascinating guy and he's like a guy who's not afraid to take some chances

524
00:31:11.811 --> 00:31:15.350
and and say some really woo woo shit.
Yeah.
I think he's a Christian as well.

525
00:31:16.080 --> 00:31:17.250
<v 6>Yeah.
I love his book.</v>

526
00:31:17.370 --> 00:31:21.480
I think you're the one who like was telling me some of the studies are not so

527
00:31:21.481 --> 00:31:22.314
great in it.

528
00:31:22.370 --> 00:31:22.530
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

529
00:31:22.530 --> 00:31:25.680
Well it wasn't that I said that is that other people would complain about that

530
00:31:25.830 --> 00:31:27.180
and they can,
cause there's some,

531
00:31:27.330 --> 00:31:31.620
there's some studies that apparently people lean on that aren't super legit,

532
00:31:31.830 --> 00:31:35.190
like the dog knowing you're coming home on.
Yeah.

533
00:31:35.400 --> 00:31:37.320
But you've got to replicate that shit because first of all,

534
00:31:37.321 --> 00:31:41.220
the guy might have a loud car.
Dogs can hear shit way better than you can.
Yeah.

535
00:31:41.221 --> 00:31:45.870
Like how far away is the guy when the dog starts going towards the door?

536
00:31:46.080 --> 00:31:49.230
Or does the guy just come home every night and the dog has like an internal

537
00:31:49.231 --> 00:31:52.840
clock and he knows,
hey,
it's five o'clock Mike wants to become a home.
Yeah.

538
00:31:52.860 --> 00:31:54.090
Like if you have,

539
00:31:54.091 --> 00:31:58.200
they replicated this for 1130 what if Mike starts coming home in a Tesla where

540
00:31:58.201 --> 00:32:01.650
you can't hear shit?
Who knows what if he comes on?
Does a dog,
actually,
no,

541
00:32:01.651 --> 00:32:05.430
he's coming.
Or is it dog?
Just hearing things.
Dog hearing adore a car.

542
00:32:06.110 --> 00:32:07.790
<v 6>I mean it's almost,
isn't always,</v>

543
00:32:07.791 --> 00:32:12.200
doesn't always kind of seem like the most boring possible.

544
00:32:13.090 --> 00:32:17.900
A solution is usually the right one.
It's like,
yeah.
What's the most boring thing?

545
00:32:17.901 --> 00:32:20.390
The most boring thing is nothing's happening.

546
00:32:20.420 --> 00:32:23.560
But you're imagining the dog is somehow,
yeah.

547
00:32:23.760 --> 00:32:27.140
Has It telepathic link to you?
Outcomes Razor,
right?
Yeah.

548
00:32:27.141 --> 00:32:30.770
Cause our cause is the simplest,
but it's also the most boring.
Like,
you know,

549
00:32:30.771 --> 00:32:33.050
these crazy fucking ufs,

550
00:32:33.051 --> 00:32:35.180
I'm sorry if you've talked about this a bunch on the podcast,

551
00:32:35.181 --> 00:32:38.120
but the UFO is that we're seeing that the,
you know,

552
00:32:38.150 --> 00:32:42.900
navy is releasing these videos of these tic tacs zipping around and its navy

553
00:32:42.901 --> 00:32:46.530
pilots.
It's not the people we interviewed in that show.

554
00:32:46.710 --> 00:32:51.620
It's navy pilots who are like,
yeah,
I don't know what the fuck this is.
And I was,

555
00:32:51.690 --> 00:32:55.320
I have great conversations with Uber drivers and like we were talking about it

556
00:32:55.321 --> 00:33:00.120
and this guy was like in a lot of them are programmers and shit and this guy was

557
00:33:00.121 --> 00:33:02.470
like,
it's probably a technique.
It's a glitch in the,

558
00:33:02.590 --> 00:33:05.790
in the type of radar they're using.
I think it must be a glitch.

559
00:33:05.791 --> 00:33:08.730
I mean that's the most likely a reality.

560
00:33:08.731 --> 00:33:11.640
They're not seeing it with their own eyes.
They're not,
I don't think so.

561
00:33:11.641 --> 00:33:14.460
I think they're just picking it up on radar.
And so he's like,

562
00:33:14.530 --> 00:33:16.530
maybe it's a glitch or maybe it's like

563
00:33:16.670 --> 00:33:19.150
<v 1>we should find that out.
Can you Google?
Um,</v>

564
00:33:19.370 --> 00:33:22.250
if the pilots were picking it up on radar,

565
00:33:22.700 --> 00:33:25.010
the pilot spotted Ufo to see if they've,

566
00:33:25.130 --> 00:33:30.130
cause I know some guys have spotted things with their own eyes.

567
00:33:31.010 --> 00:33:33.050
I know,
I know for sure some guys have.

568
00:33:33.210 --> 00:33:35.290
<v 6>Um,
I just,
I'm not sure if the dad is that,
I think</v>

569
00:33:35.360 --> 00:33:37.580
<v 1>it's probably relevant to the conversation though.</v>

570
00:33:37.610 --> 00:33:40.760
It's probably a good thing that we know people listening going,
Yo,
what the fuck?

571
00:33:41.210 --> 00:33:45.620
Um,
I get super skeptical.
Yeah.
I feel like,

572
00:33:46.040 --> 00:33:50.210
I feel like almost like it's a plot.
I don't want to go full Eddie Bravo,

573
00:33:50.510 --> 00:33:53.930
but I feel like when I see people talking about Ufos,
I'm like,
okay,

574
00:33:53.931 --> 00:33:56.030
what else is going on?
What are you distracting me from?

575
00:33:56.360 --> 00:34:00.450
[inaudible] is this really a big issue?
I was like,
is it really happening?
Well,

576
00:34:00.451 --> 00:34:05.240
can I see it?
What do you got?
Got Nothing.
Oh,
you got like some radar.

577
00:34:05.780 --> 00:34:09.440
You've got radar from one,
two pilots,
three piles.
Okay.
I believe it,

578
00:34:09.590 --> 00:34:12.860
but I want to see more.
Why do I want to see more?
Like what am I?

579
00:34:13.090 --> 00:34:16.140
And you'll get caught up in it and it'll chew up hours of your day.

580
00:34:16.760 --> 00:34:19.070
There's a lot,
lot of those guys that we ran into on that show,

581
00:34:19.880 --> 00:34:23.960
I felt bad for them because they didn't understand what had happened to them.

582
00:34:24.200 --> 00:34:29.200
They'd gotten caught in this weird loop of looking for secrets and looking for

583
00:34:30.631 --> 00:34:35.631
mysteries to be solved and looking for hidden conspiracies and they get caught

584
00:34:36.771 --> 00:34:41.060
in that and some of that shit is real,
which is part of the problem.

585
00:34:41.270 --> 00:34:45.470
Some of it you can come across the Gulf of Tonkin in the north woods operation

586
00:34:45.490 --> 00:34:45.830
Northwoods.

587
00:34:45.830 --> 00:34:49.520
You can come across a bunch of them that are real and raw and you can see how

588
00:34:49.521 --> 00:34:51.140
they put that together.
You're like,
what?

589
00:34:51.440 --> 00:34:56.440
You could see real crazy conspiring and then you can get lost and think it's

590
00:34:57.381 --> 00:34:58.800
everywhere.
That's right.

591
00:34:58.880 --> 00:35:02.420
<v 6>Yeah.
Well,
I mean this is like,
dude,
I was just</v>

592
00:35:02.700 --> 00:35:07.260
<v 1>Jamie.
Oh,
according today,
the a viz.</v>

593
00:35:07.410 --> 00:35:08.243
What does that mean?

594
00:35:09.430 --> 00:35:12.700
<v 6>Is that the two of you?
How about you say Ufo?
Yeah.</v>

595
00:35:12.750 --> 00:35:14.410
Are you really going to change Ufo?

596
00:35:14.430 --> 00:35:18.500
<v 1>Then they're like,
they have their own little thing.
They were avs.</v>

597
00:35:18.530 --> 00:35:21.260
We don't refer to us as CFOs was in my pronouns

598
00:35:23.190 --> 00:35:28.190
day fees appeared at an altitude greater than 80,000 feet far higher than

599
00:35:28.281 --> 00:35:32.720
commercial or military jets.
Typically fi fly initially,
the print,

600
00:35:33.020 --> 00:35:37.770
Princeton's radar team with the radar.
Really high proxy or stories,

601
00:35:37.780 --> 00:35:40.660
what it's called.
It's like a really high processing radar system or something.

602
00:35:40.700 --> 00:35:43.600
Is it spelled prince ton of its print store?

603
00:35:43.610 --> 00:35:47.920
Not his prince done apostrophes in a weird spot.
Oh,
okay.
Um,

604
00:35:47.950 --> 00:35:51.910
the radar team didn't believe what they were seeing chalking up the anomalies.

605
00:35:51.911 --> 00:35:53.560
Soon a equipment malfunction.

606
00:35:53.561 --> 00:35:57.040
But after they determined that everything was operating as it should,

607
00:35:57.041 --> 00:36:01.630
they began detecting instances which the AAVs.
I want to know what that means.

608
00:36:02.110 --> 00:36:06.310
Dropped with astounding speed to lower busier airspace.

609
00:36:06.520 --> 00:36:10.270
They approached the princetons commander about taking action.

610
00:36:10.630 --> 00:36:13.540
He said I was chomping at the bit.
I really wanted to intercept these things.

611
00:36:13.541 --> 00:36:17.500
What?
Yeah,
that's,
we have the fucking craziest people in this country.

612
00:36:17.710 --> 00:36:20.560
Like there's a fucking,
there's an alien man.
I want to chase it.

613
00:36:20.620 --> 00:36:23.350
I want to catch up by the tail.
The tail.

614
00:36:24.460 --> 00:36:29.460
Anomalous aerial vehicles can come walk out area name for it.

615
00:36:29.760 --> 00:36:32.270
<v 2>You ever invented that new name is an APP.</v>

616
00:36:32.320 --> 00:36:36.980
<v 1>He's an asshole.
Oh,
so actually the one who decided to call them a v.</v>

617
00:36:37.230 --> 00:36:41.350
Come on.
You know,
technically it's not an unidentified flying objects.

618
00:36:41.390 --> 00:36:45.350
<v 2>Did you take taking our fucking Ufo is man,
I'm,
I'm going to fight that.</v>

619
00:36:45.380 --> 00:36:48.710
What is it again?
What is the exact phrase?
Aerial vehicle.

620
00:36:48.730 --> 00:36:52.630
Anomalous aerial vehicle v.
You're an asshole.
[inaudible].

621
00:36:53.090 --> 00:36:56.180
It's an anomaly.
The new name for you.

622
00:36:56.181 --> 00:36:58.700
Fos anonymous area

623
00:36:58.770 --> 00:37:02.300
<v 1>vehicle,
probably a part of $1 billion study to Fa.</v>

624
00:37:02.370 --> 00:37:05.610
Two fighters were diverted to intercept one of the strange objects when they

625
00:37:05.611 --> 00:37:08.970
first arrived on the scene.
The pilots didn't see any flying objects,

626
00:37:08.971 --> 00:37:13.260
but they did observe what the lead pilot commander David favor later referred to

627
00:37:13.261 --> 00:37:16.020
as a disturbance in the ocean.
Oh,

628
00:37:16.200 --> 00:37:19.260
the water was churning with white wave's,

629
00:37:19.261 --> 00:37:24.261
breaking hoever what looked like a large object just under the surface.

630
00:37:25.230 --> 00:37:28.980
Then they know it's one of the objects flying about 50 feet above the water

631
00:37:29.550 --> 00:37:32.220
favor the commander of the elite black aces squadron.

632
00:37:32.221 --> 00:37:37.170
It's a god Goddamn Nicholas cage movie who was a top gun program graduate with

633
00:37:37.171 --> 00:37:39.390
more than 16 years of flying experience.

634
00:37:39.391 --> 00:37:44.391
Described it as about 40 feet long shaped like a tic Tac candy with no obvious

635
00:37:44.521 --> 00:37:47.850
means of propulsion.
It's white.
It has no wings,

636
00:37:48.600 --> 00:37:52.110
it has no rotors.
I go,
Holy Shit.
What is that

637
00:37:52.480 --> 00:37:53.560
<v 2>dude?
You know that guy,</v>

638
00:37:53.590 --> 00:37:56.500
whoever the company is that makes tic tacs and you were like

639
00:37:58.240 --> 00:38:00.670
<v 1>tic tacs.
It's free publicity.</v>

640
00:38:00.820 --> 00:38:04.190
Totally protect tax is the ones sponsoring this whole deal.
You think it is?
Yeah,

641
00:38:04.220 --> 00:38:06.400
man.
People are buying tictacs right now.
Listen to this.

642
00:38:06.700 --> 00:38:10.570
You just say ticktack enough like you remember those old subliminal things.

643
00:38:10.571 --> 00:38:13.660
He's doing movie theaters.
When you're watching a movie it,
it'd say hungry,

644
00:38:13.661 --> 00:38:17.620
eat popcorn like every like 5100th frame.

645
00:38:17.860 --> 00:38:20.560
They would stick like a hungry eat popcorn.

646
00:38:20.590 --> 00:38:24.370
It was like subliminal texts on the sharing.
You be like,
damn,

647
00:38:24.371 --> 00:38:26.880
I want some popcorn.
If you just say ticktack

648
00:38:26.990 --> 00:38:29.630
<v 2>tic tacs,
people are buying tic tacs right now.</v>

649
00:38:29.720 --> 00:38:32.300
While we do know that pilot's got great breath,
right?

650
00:38:32.301 --> 00:38:36.460
I mean that's a tic tac man.
It's like the first time.
See a UFO either.

651
00:38:36.470 --> 00:38:40.130
First thing that pops into your head is it looks like a mint.
That's nuts.

652
00:38:40.340 --> 00:38:44.690
There had to be other ways to describe it.
Stocking tictacs bro.
For sure.

653
00:38:44.960 --> 00:38:48.290
I have googled ticktack after he said that to her because I couldn't remember if

654
00:38:48.291 --> 00:38:50.990
they were square or if they were like take,
you know

655
00:38:51.090 --> 00:38:54.900
<v 1>that they look to me,
I would expect a good UFO o'clock.
Yeah.</v>

656
00:38:55.190 --> 00:38:58.590
Kind of boring like Super Apple.
Like,

657
00:38:58.920 --> 00:39:01.050
like if apple made a u of M.
Yeah.

658
00:39:01.200 --> 00:39:03.170
<v 2>It's like a clique.</v>

659
00:39:03.210 --> 00:39:06.330
Pretty sleek but don't going into the ocean part.

660
00:39:06.360 --> 00:39:10.560
That's the part I liked the best because that kind of lines up with hollow earth

661
00:39:10.561 --> 00:39:15.060
theory and not and like maybe like they're flying down.
Yeah.
In the,

662
00:39:15.061 --> 00:39:15.990
in the center of the year.

663
00:39:16.020 --> 00:39:18.240
<v 1>Of course they have a base in the or why wouldn't you have a base in the ocean?</v>

664
00:39:18.241 --> 00:39:20.940
We never go there.
Do you ever fly over?
I was just,
no.

665
00:39:20.941 --> 00:39:24.720
Why you fly over five hours of water?
It's just water.

666
00:39:24.920 --> 00:39:26.940
<v 2>Oh yeah.
Well that's that Strava APP thing.</v>

667
00:39:26.941 --> 00:39:28.860
I feel like we've talked about literally everything,
you know,

668
00:39:28.861 --> 00:39:32.970
the Strava App and worrying about it.
Okay,
good.
That's great man.
I love that.

669
00:39:32.971 --> 00:39:36.240
I have to think if,
pretty sure we talked about this,
the heat maps,

670
00:39:36.241 --> 00:39:39.540
the Strava heat maps that seemed to show people walking under the ocean and

671
00:39:39.541 --> 00:39:42.690
stuff walking.
Yeah we haven't.

672
00:39:43.180 --> 00:39:47.960
Oh so yeah cause like Strava,
you know,
it's like,
um,
I think it was Strava,
right?

673
00:39:47.961 --> 00:39:51.840
It's like a way for you to track your steps and some people apparently are in

674
00:39:51.841 --> 00:39:56.841
some faces in the Arctic or in the ocean walking around and it showed up before

675
00:39:57.271 --> 00:40:01.350
they could like turn that function off for top secret facilities.

676
00:40:01.351 --> 00:40:03.690
Like the places they blur out on Google maps.

677
00:40:03.720 --> 00:40:06.860
So do you think there's like a military base under the water somewhere with

678
00:40:06.870 --> 00:40:11.100
submarines go?
God Man,
you know,
I want to think that,
but I'm like,

679
00:40:11.101 --> 00:40:15.090
oh it's a movie.
The Mig.
Yeah,
I think it's probably a technical error,

680
00:40:15.091 --> 00:40:17.730
but fuck maybe,
I mean,
I don't know.

681
00:40:17.731 --> 00:40:22.731
It's like the implication of these take tax and all of it.

682
00:40:22.801 --> 00:40:24.690
If you really want to like the first,

683
00:40:24.691 --> 00:40:29.490
to me the most obvious one minus the churning water evidence is that it's some

684
00:40:29.491 --> 00:40:31.080
kind of equipment malfunction.

685
00:40:31.540 --> 00:40:35.840
<v 1>It's also that they have an unlimited budget for black ops.</v>

686
00:40:36.230 --> 00:40:40.130
We don't know what that number is.
That's right.
We don't get to know.
Right.

687
00:40:40.160 --> 00:40:44.120
All the weird shit they do and they're making stealth bombers and all that area

688
00:40:44.121 --> 00:40:48.990
51 stuff like how much money goes to that,
like what is the number?

689
00:40:49.190 --> 00:40:54.110
Let's Google this.
How much does the US spend on black ops?

690
00:40:54.910 --> 00:40:58.240
<v 4>I had,
I was going to bring this up in the middle of what you guys are talking a,</v>

691
00:40:58.370 --> 00:41:03.370
there's a program here that was going on the a tip advanced aerospace threat

692
00:41:05.471 --> 00:41:06.700
identification program.

693
00:41:06.701 --> 00:41:11.701
What's going on and had an eight to pluck you out of your money,

694
00:41:12.131 --> 00:41:13.780
but I'm just going to use the AA tip.

695
00:41:14.770 --> 00:41:19.720
22 million is what their budget was in 2012 and the said that it doesn't still

696
00:41:19.721 --> 00:41:21.190
go on,
but apparently it does.

697
00:41:21.191 --> 00:41:25.790
Louis Elizondo was still operating and he is part of,
they spent

698
00:41:25.830 --> 00:41:29.640
<v 1>$22 million to see if the Ufos were a threat a year.</v>

699
00:41:30.060 --> 00:41:34.860
Oh there is the to the stars academy.
Yeah,
that's,
that's Tom delonge stuff.
Yeah.

700
00:41:35.670 --> 00:41:39.750
So,
well some of it's still going on.
It's all,
it's,
listen,
I am,

701
00:41:39.780 --> 00:41:43.950
I'm fucking rooting for it.
I want it to be real.
I would love it if it was real.

702
00:41:43.950 --> 00:41:47.160
<v 6>But if you look at like the history of the great ideas,</v>

703
00:41:47.161 --> 00:41:52.161
a lot of them did come from a like weird moments,

704
00:41:53.011 --> 00:41:54.420
you know,
like Tesla,

705
00:41:54.780 --> 00:41:58.860
like basically had a seizure and felt like it was being contacted by something.

706
00:41:58.861 --> 00:42:01.980
Like you do run into stories of,

707
00:42:02.400 --> 00:42:04.380
at the very least inspiration,

708
00:42:04.381 --> 00:42:09.150
but quite often innovation coming to people via like,

709
00:42:09.670 --> 00:42:10.503
okay,
cheers

710
00:42:10.970 --> 00:42:11.930
<v 1>I transmission.</v>

711
00:42:12.140 --> 00:42:17.120
Well I've been thinking this for a long time that maybe ideas are living things

712
00:42:17.780 --> 00:42:21.070
and these ideas,
even though they eat,

713
00:42:21.200 --> 00:42:26.200
you think of them as something your brain's creating and maybe you brain is

714
00:42:26.721 --> 00:42:27.670
creating it.
Yeah.

715
00:42:27.760 --> 00:42:32.090
Maybe it uses your brain to create it so that it can manifest itself in the real

716
00:42:32.091 --> 00:42:34.310
world.
So when you have ideas,

717
00:42:34.490 --> 00:42:37.850
whether ideas that turned out to be art or music,
like you know,

718
00:42:37.880 --> 00:42:40.190
Jimi Hendrix comes out with Voodoo child,
you're,

719
00:42:40.550 --> 00:42:44.900
you are inspired by that.
Yeah.
You see it,

720
00:42:44.901 --> 00:42:49.100
it gives you a great feeling.
You exchange currency to listen to it.
I mean,

721
00:42:49.101 --> 00:42:52.840
just that one song,
how much money's been generated by Voodoo child.
I mean,

722
00:42:52.850 --> 00:42:55.700
it's one of the greatest songs in the history of the known universe.

723
00:42:55.710 --> 00:42:59.630
It's the opening guitar riff.
I've listened to that a thousand times easy.

724
00:42:59.631 --> 00:43:03.240
I listened to it all the time.
Whenever I'm,
I'm like,
I need a pick me up.
That

725
00:43:06.090 --> 00:43:10.940
probably,
I mean it's just,
it's a masterpiece.
It's a masterpiece of music.

726
00:43:11.660 --> 00:43:15.440
And where'd that idea come from?
Well,
it came from his brain.
Right?

727
00:43:15.770 --> 00:43:17.840
But where was it before it was in his brain.
Well,

728
00:43:17.841 --> 00:43:19.580
how does brain cook it up and what is it?

729
00:43:19.640 --> 00:43:22.850
What are these things they're just floating around that you grabbed out of

730
00:43:22.851 --> 00:43:27.290
culture and how do you turn them into something that people go crazy for?
Yeah.

731
00:43:27.350 --> 00:43:31.910
Because occasionally a guy will take one of those ideas and make voodoo child or

732
00:43:31.911 --> 00:43:36.140
you know,
make someone else's song or make someone else's painting or,
or,

733
00:43:36.200 --> 00:43:38.900
you know,
make a fucking building that's inspiring.

734
00:43:39.260 --> 00:43:42.620
There's these things that come into your head.
That's right.
And you're,

735
00:43:42.670 --> 00:43:44.210
you w at the end,

736
00:43:44.211 --> 00:43:48.710
what they really do is they like the eggs of objects because they,

737
00:43:48.800 --> 00:43:53.240
they come to your mind,
you think about them,
and then you say,

738
00:43:53.300 --> 00:43:57.490
I'm going to make a fucking clock.
And you start making a clock.
That's right.

739
00:43:57.500 --> 00:43:59.000
Where's that coming from?
Where the,
Oh,

740
00:43:59.001 --> 00:44:01.070
it's just your creativity and it's just your mind.

741
00:44:01.071 --> 00:44:03.680
It's just your imagination and well,
it's just your thought process.

742
00:44:03.681 --> 00:44:07.010
Your synapses firing.
Yeah,
yeah,
yeah.
You're right.
You're right.
We're all,

743
00:44:07.011 --> 00:44:11.360
you're absolutely right.
There's no real woo woo.
Or is there,

744
00:44:11.480 --> 00:44:15.290
what the fuck is a thought?
Figure that out.

745
00:44:15.320 --> 00:44:19.340
No one knows what that is.
Especially where,
where are they coming from?
You,

746
00:44:19.341 --> 00:44:19.551
I mean,

747
00:44:19.551 --> 00:44:22.340
how many times you've read have written a joke and you're laughing at yourself

748
00:44:22.580 --> 00:44:24.540
as you're writing.
Like,
where the fuck did that?
Yeah,

749
00:44:24.760 --> 00:44:27.310
<v 6>yeah,
yeah.
Well,
I mean,
or saying any,</v>

750
00:44:27.340 --> 00:44:30.070
sometimes like you're watching sentences come out of your mouth and you're sort

751
00:44:30.071 --> 00:44:31.980
of feel like,
yeah,

752
00:44:32.070 --> 00:44:36.890
<v 2>every day,
all the time.
Right now,
where is the,
you know,
who's articulate again?</v>

753
00:44:37.040 --> 00:44:39.020
There's,
uh,
this,
um,

754
00:44:39.980 --> 00:44:43.340
I've been studying Buddhism and any Buddhist out there,
if I fuck this up,

755
00:44:43.341 --> 00:44:46.680
I'm sorry if you,
if you're more advanced or know more about it.
So I'm pregnant,

756
00:44:46.710 --> 00:44:49.460
say the words wrong and stuff.
It's really interesting.

757
00:44:49.910 --> 00:44:53.870
So it's like there's like eight consciousnesses,
uh,

758
00:44:54.440 --> 00:44:58.520
I think it's eight.
And the sixth one is your thought,
the continuum of thoughts,

759
00:44:58.550 --> 00:45:00.170
right?
So that's like,
we're,

760
00:45:00.171 --> 00:45:02.600
most people hang out and they think that's who they are,

761
00:45:02.601 --> 00:45:05.840
is that infinite cycle of repeating thoughts in their head.

762
00:45:05.841 --> 00:45:08.780
So below that is your senses.

763
00:45:09.170 --> 00:45:12.710
And then the one right above that is the seventh,

764
00:45:12.711 --> 00:45:17.180
and that's what is considered your subconscious in the west.
But,
um,

765
00:45:17.300 --> 00:45:21.980
so that's where all your memories are.
That's where all your,
uh,

766
00:45:22.280 --> 00:45:27.110
like,
uh,
just all the shit,
you can't remember that happened to you,
that,

767
00:45:27.320 --> 00:45:28.110
uh,
the,

768
00:45:28.110 --> 00:45:32.570
that stuck back there that appears in people's Aarp or appears in your neurosis

769
00:45:32.571 --> 00:45:33.404
or whatever.

770
00:45:33.470 --> 00:45:38.470
And then above that is the eighth consciousness and that's the stored experience

771
00:45:39.951 --> 00:45:43.250
of all human beings.
And that's happening.

772
00:45:43.251 --> 00:45:47.150
It's like the global mind or it's Kashic records.
Yeah.
Well,
yeah,

773
00:45:47.151 --> 00:45:48.550
the Akashic records yet.

774
00:45:48.551 --> 00:45:52.760
And so basically that one drips down like a,

775
00:45:52.790 --> 00:45:56.510
like water in a cave.
It drips down into your subconscious,

776
00:45:56.511 --> 00:45:59.960
which drips down into your thoughts.
So when you're having these thoughts,

777
00:46:00.170 --> 00:46:04.700
according to this model,
uh,
it's not necessarily your thoughts.

778
00:46:04.730 --> 00:46:06.660
You're getting a kind of distillate.

779
00:46:06.720 --> 00:46:11.030
It's rolling down through the global mind,

780
00:46:11.270 --> 00:46:16.270
being flavored by your subconscious and then being flavored by your identity or

781
00:46:16.311 --> 00:46:19.580
who you think you are.
And then,
so by the time it comes out of you,

782
00:46:19.910 --> 00:46:22.730
it's got you wrapped up inside of it,

783
00:46:22.731 --> 00:46:26.720
but it's a projection of some like shared mind.

784
00:46:27.380 --> 00:46:29.000
It's pretty cool.
Makes

785
00:46:29.740 --> 00:46:34.220
<v 1>uh,
that makes actual sense.
Yeah.
No,
that sounds like crazy Voodoo hippy talk,</v>

786
00:46:34.250 --> 00:46:39.250
but it actually makes sense that we all know that there's something that we

787
00:46:39.381 --> 00:46:43.790
share the,
and we all feed off of each other.
I mean,

788
00:46:43.791 --> 00:46:46.970
you don't have to say this many times that I am a different person with you.

789
00:46:47.030 --> 00:46:47.510
Yeah.

790
00:46:47.510 --> 00:46:50.570
Like we were different together and we're different with other people as well.

791
00:46:50.571 --> 00:46:54.320
I mean,
that's how human beings are.
When we,
when we interact with each other,

792
00:46:54.321 --> 00:46:58.150
we have this a bonding thing.
There's a,
uh,
there's a,

793
00:46:58.151 --> 00:47:02.600
an interaction thing and that's why some people are toxic for you.
I mean,

794
00:47:02.601 --> 00:47:04.970
the idea that you're supposed to stay with everyone,
it's like crazy.

795
00:47:04.971 --> 00:47:08.240
Like some people are just not good for you.
It's not a good mix.
You know,

796
00:47:08.241 --> 00:47:10.610
you're not good for them.
They're not good for you to get out.
Yeah.

797
00:47:11.090 --> 00:47:15.590
But there's something that's going on.
It's not you just as an individual.

798
00:47:15.620 --> 00:47:20.210
And then when we were talking about Gut biome and,
uh,
and that as well,
you're,

799
00:47:20.211 --> 00:47:23.800
you're,
you're also sharing gut biome with each other,

800
00:47:23.810 --> 00:47:28.450
sharing DNA with each other,
and you're sharing the skin.
There's,

801
00:47:28.480 --> 00:47:32.770
there's little Corgan isms living on your body.
You Hug people with no shirt on,

802
00:47:32.771 --> 00:47:36.760
you sharing organisms.
Yeah.
It's one of the reasons why it feels good.
I bet.
Yeah.

803
00:47:36.790 --> 00:47:40.390
Yeah,
man.
I mean it's probably a great way to swap organisms to keeping spreading

804
00:47:40.610 --> 00:47:43.220
<v 2>you,
I mean,
yeah,
it benefits your biome,</v>

805
00:47:43.221 --> 00:47:46.800
I felt like wants to like pollinated or get out into the world

806
00:47:46.840 --> 00:47:50.890
<v 1>for sure.
I was reading about listening,
actually listening to a podcast,</v>

807
00:47:51.220 --> 00:47:53.290
the Steven Rinella podcasts immediate or,

808
00:47:53.291 --> 00:47:57.130
and there was a guy on who was an expert in moving wildlife around how they
look.

809
00:47:57.131 --> 00:47:59.590
Sometimes I'll move wolves and a certain particular areas.

810
00:47:59.830 --> 00:48:04.390
They had too many moose in this one island and so they moved wolves in,

811
00:48:04.660 --> 00:48:08.500
but the wolves,
there wasn't enough of them and that they were on an island,

812
00:48:08.501 --> 00:48:11.560
so they all start fucking each other and they were fucking their kids and their

813
00:48:11.590 --> 00:48:14.590
did.
Their DNA just was a mess.
Yeah.

814
00:48:14.591 --> 00:48:17.470
Just all sorts of inbreeding and it was just terrible.

815
00:48:17.740 --> 00:48:22.630
Which is also fascinating.
It's like nature's like,
no,
no,
no,
no,
no,

816
00:48:22.631 --> 00:48:25.540
no,
no.
You can't just stay around and fuck each other.

817
00:48:25.780 --> 00:48:28.810
You got to get out there like nature.
Even with animals.

818
00:48:28.811 --> 00:48:32.330
Nature's like [inaudible] this is not the game we're playing the game or planes,

819
00:48:32.350 --> 00:48:35.980
not male and female.
The gamer pan is male that doesn't know female.

820
00:48:36.320 --> 00:48:39.700
That's the game because you can't fuck your sister and you can't fuck your mom

821
00:48:39.800 --> 00:48:41.620
stop if you do it a few times.

822
00:48:41.890 --> 00:48:45.610
But after a while your kids are just not going to come out good.
Which is weird,

823
00:48:45.611 --> 00:48:49.780
right?
Like how come if your good and your sister's good,

824
00:48:49.990 --> 00:48:53.770
how come if you have sex there's a high likelihood that the kid won't be good.

825
00:48:53.800 --> 00:48:57.640
There's something wrong with the child and if the child fucks the sister and

826
00:48:57.641 --> 00:49:00.790
then they have a child,
it's even more likely.
Yeah.
You know what I mean?

827
00:49:01.000 --> 00:49:03.610
This is what inbreeding is and this is one of the reasons why you have a lot of

828
00:49:03.611 --> 00:49:06.540
problems with certain dogs species.
Sure.
Yeah.
It's,

829
00:49:06.620 --> 00:49:10.060
it's a weird little thing that nature's got built into it.

830
00:49:10.450 --> 00:49:13.450
You can just like keep moving,
bitch,
keep touching each other.

831
00:49:13.460 --> 00:49:17.530
Keeps spreading the biome.
Gotta move.
Yeah.
When am I or what you are swapping,

832
00:49:17.531 --> 00:49:19.030
spit that,
keep it moving.

833
00:49:19.070 --> 00:49:23.180
<v 2>Have you seen a planet earth would that poor slot,
that poor Horny,
lonely sloths?</v>

834
00:49:23.240 --> 00:49:24.073
He's Horny.

835
00:49:24.210 --> 00:49:27.950
I'm pretty sure it was a slot that was some kind of slow moving tree creature

836
00:49:28.280 --> 00:49:30.680
and they set it up.
You know,
I don't know how much of it is real,

837
00:49:30.681 --> 00:49:34.070
like how much of it is they're just filming animals and telling a story about

838
00:49:34.071 --> 00:49:36.560
them.
But this law is horny.

839
00:49:36.590 --> 00:49:41.590
Like bully how's out into the forest like in eight years,

840
00:49:41.781 --> 00:49:46.040
like a shriek of an of a woman,
a female like and it's like,
oh fuck,

841
00:49:46.041 --> 00:49:48.320
you know it's they yet this poor guy.

842
00:49:48.321 --> 00:49:50.360
Look how far can you get it from where he's in the tree.

843
00:49:50.361 --> 00:49:53.630
Are we allowed to show that?
Doesn't own it,
but you don't show it.
So he,

844
00:49:53.780 --> 00:49:56.000
he doesn't have a girlfriend.
That's what's up.
Yeah.

845
00:49:56.001 --> 00:50:00.320
And so he's a clientele of the soft world.
This is an,
it's in cell slot.

846
00:50:00.350 --> 00:50:03.930
It's not because this one's actually is,
this slough has going for it.

847
00:50:03.931 --> 00:50:07.900
It's like it's not staying in his apartment on the Internet.
It's,

848
00:50:08.000 --> 00:50:11.270
it's leaving his tree swimming across an ocean,

849
00:50:11.480 --> 00:50:13.040
climbing up another tree.

850
00:50:13.680 --> 00:50:18.630
<v 1>But what a dirty trick nature played on this motherfucker to have a move so</v>

851
00:50:18.631 --> 00:50:22.650
slow.
Everyone can catch you.
Yeah.
It's like nature's like,
listen,

852
00:50:22.920 --> 00:50:24.660
you guys are too fucking stupid.

853
00:50:24.661 --> 00:50:27.770
There's too many of you were going to have to have it so eagles you off.

854
00:50:27.980 --> 00:50:31.580
So they have them so slow.
Literally no one can miss them.

855
00:50:31.700 --> 00:50:34.730
What a damn dirty trick he ever see a bear run.

856
00:50:34.760 --> 00:50:39.710
They run fast.
You ever see how fucking wolf or a coyote,
Rhonda?
Ridiculous.

857
00:50:39.890 --> 00:50:44.000
This poor bastard,
this poor bastard is going so slow.

858
00:50:44.001 --> 00:50:47.030
It looks like he's on slow Mo.
Like we're looking at the leaves.

859
00:50:47.300 --> 00:50:51.020
The leaves are moving normal speed,
but he looks like he's on fucking slow Mo.

860
00:50:51.050 --> 00:50:54.860
He looks like he's been eating Benzos for the last nine months.

861
00:50:54.861 --> 00:50:59.780
Like just fucked up.
He's got an infinite Xanax prescription.
But yeah.

862
00:51:00.430 --> 00:51:04.070
Yeah,
he's barely getting lot.
Yeah.
What are,

863
00:51:04.071 --> 00:51:09.071
we must look so fast to them like to them we must seem terrifying and how

864
00:51:09.680 --> 00:51:12.350
quickly we're moving about the eagles.
You know,

865
00:51:12.470 --> 00:51:17.000
what does that eagle that that gets them in South America?
The Harpy Eagle?

866
00:51:17.270 --> 00:51:21.380
Is that what it is?
The biggest ego on earth.
I didn't know harpies eight slots.

867
00:51:21.470 --> 00:51:25.460
All they eat is monkeys and slaws cranes.
That's their favorite shit.

868
00:51:25.461 --> 00:51:29.690
They snatch these slots out of the tree pitch here and they just dumped him.

869
00:51:29.691 --> 00:51:34.370
Trump.
Trump.
Trump.
Oh Dude.
What is it?
A fight.
A fight between them.

870
00:51:34.950 --> 00:51:37.700
Whoa.
Fights back.
Oh my goodness.
Oh,

871
00:51:37.701 --> 00:51:42.440
that's a real young Eagle Navy fight is that although the sloths is actually

872
00:51:42.441 --> 00:51:46.430
swinging at the Eagle,
imagine sorta.
He'd be like,
what are you doing man?

873
00:51:46.580 --> 00:51:49.970
It's more like when someone's trying to wake you up.
It's like,
yeah,
yeah,
no,

874
00:51:49.971 --> 00:51:52.760
that's like a drunk guy at a bar and you're trying not to fuck them up.

875
00:51:53.150 --> 00:51:57.020
Please don't make me hit you.
That is exactly it.

876
00:51:57.530 --> 00:51:59.820
And the Eagle seems perplexed by it.
Yeah,

877
00:51:59.860 --> 00:52:04.850
but you see the Harpy Eagle kill one because it's crazy,
man.

878
00:52:04.851 --> 00:52:08.600
They just swooped down.
They're so enormous.
And one of these guys,
first of all,

879
00:52:08.601 --> 00:52:13.601
Kudos to all these wildlife biologists that actually go down there and risk

880
00:52:14.091 --> 00:52:17.660
their ass like that.
Boom.
Hold on back that up again,

881
00:52:18.380 --> 00:52:20.750
mother fucker.
Boom.
Jesus.

882
00:52:20.990 --> 00:52:25.220
That is a big killer bird.
And he just snatches that poor little guy.

883
00:52:25.880 --> 00:52:29.300
Um,
but somebody had to be there to film that and there was one of them that are

884
00:52:29.301 --> 00:52:30.620
watched on the Harpy Eagle,

885
00:52:30.770 --> 00:52:35.770
which is a beautiful animal where this guy who was a photographer who was one of

886
00:52:36.171 --> 00:52:38.900
the scientists who study and them got attacked,

887
00:52:39.910 --> 00:52:44.560
the eagle swooped in and fucking took a swing at him.
She was he okay.
Yeah,

888
00:52:44.660 --> 00:52:45.493
barely.

889
00:52:45.500 --> 00:52:50.480
But I mean that gets sketchy when a 25 pound flying bird with knives coming out

890
00:52:50.481 --> 00:52:54.140
of its feet is trying to snatch you and something that can literally carry a

891
00:52:54.141 --> 00:52:54.650
fish.

892
00:52:54.650 --> 00:52:58.130
Can you imagine how strong your hand would be if you could shove your hand into

893
00:52:58.131 --> 00:53:02.270
the river,
snatch a salmon and pull it out with one hand?
I'm going to be honest.

894
00:53:02.271 --> 00:53:06.130
It's that strong.
I do that.
That's how I fished some amazing,
I love the feeling.

895
00:53:06.140 --> 00:53:09.800
Make a youtube video.
I don't want to film myself out in nature.

896
00:53:09.801 --> 00:53:11.890
You know how it is as [inaudible] it.

897
00:53:11.920 --> 00:53:16.250
That's my private time in the wild are they just snatch them and then they fly

898
00:53:16.251 --> 00:53:18.260
with them.
They're so fucking strong.

899
00:53:18.710 --> 00:53:21.680
That thing was coming after you and I think the Harpy Eagles probably even

900
00:53:21.681 --> 00:53:25.890
bigger than 25 pounds,
I think 25 pounds.
Like a big Bald Eagle.

901
00:53:26.430 --> 00:53:29.560
<v 4>Yeah.
I'm thinking the Harpy Eagles even larger than that dude.</v>

902
00:53:30.150 --> 00:53:33.270
One of my friends told me something that has always kind of creeped me out.

903
00:53:33.300 --> 00:53:37.560
It's obviously probably not true,
but like know things.
Yeah.

904
00:53:37.561 --> 00:53:42.210
My two university of Bro Science,
uh,
is 11 pounds.

905
00:53:42.570 --> 00:53:47.020
That's it.
Yeah.
What's the heaviest eagle.
Wow.

906
00:53:47.021 --> 00:53:49.200
I'm off big time.
I guess that makes sense though,

907
00:53:49.230 --> 00:53:51.790
because like a Turkey is the giant Turkeys,

908
00:53:51.810 --> 00:53:56.130
like a 20 pound Turkey that the Stellar's see eagle is average weight,

909
00:53:56.131 --> 00:53:59.460
15 pounds.
Oh Wow.
Philippon Eagle.
14 pounds.

910
00:53:59.461 --> 00:54:03.240
Harpy Eagle 13.1 shit.
Well,
I,
why do I feel like we've done this before?

911
00:54:03.270 --> 00:54:04.830
I don't know.
I feel like you were,
I thought you were right though,

912
00:54:04.831 --> 00:54:06.270
but maybe it's just,

913
00:54:06.530 --> 00:54:10.360
I thought I was in focus and I had to bet whether or not you looked at the way

914
00:54:10.361 --> 00:54:12.870
to the biggest eagle,
I would bet $1 million.

915
00:54:12.960 --> 00:54:16.020
I know what it looked at and know exactly what it is.
It's a,

916
00:54:16.021 --> 00:54:19.740
I've got to confuse with an,
with an extinct eagle in New Zealand.

917
00:54:20.010 --> 00:54:22.410
That was enormous.
Did they think hunted people?

918
00:54:22.740 --> 00:54:27.320
And that one was 25 pounds and I was shocked that it was only 25 pounds called

919
00:54:27.330 --> 00:54:31.990
the Haast eagle h a s t show.
A picture of what that fucking thing was.
Let's,

920
00:54:31.991 --> 00:54:36.090
none of them verified to exceed 20 pounds,
but they think they were bigger.
Yeah.

921
00:54:36.240 --> 00:54:38.340
See,
that's it.
That's where I fucked up.

922
00:54:38.460 --> 00:54:42.420
I was looking at this thing and I was like,
why?
It's only 20 pounds,
25 pounds,

923
00:54:42.600 --> 00:54:45.840
because you look at the size of it,
it was fucking huge.

924
00:54:45.841 --> 00:54:47.970
And they really think they might've hunted humans.

925
00:54:48.950 --> 00:54:52.740
She thinks that might be why the people,
uh,
I think there was New Zealand,

926
00:54:52.830 --> 00:54:54.690
one of the people in New Zealand wiped him out.

927
00:54:55.500 --> 00:54:58.200
And this was like before the white man came and fucked everything up.

928
00:54:58.650 --> 00:55:02.370
Did you see that documentary on Falcon nearing?
No.
Which one is up?

929
00:55:02.400 --> 00:55:05.820
It's this woman.
He's like,
I wish I could remember her name,

930
00:55:05.821 --> 00:55:10.821
but she like goes up to I think like Tibet and they like took her in and taught

931
00:55:11.551 --> 00:55:15.540
her how to like hunt because it's the way they hunt with birds and like it,

932
00:55:15.760 --> 00:55:17.460
the whole relationship you have,

933
00:55:17.461 --> 00:55:21.840
you sort of have to raise the Falcon from a baby and they're like connected to

934
00:55:21.841 --> 00:55:22.051
it.

935
00:55:22.051 --> 00:55:27.051
But it's the most insane thing to witness because it's such a remote place and

936
00:55:29.401 --> 00:55:33.570
it's such a,
like traditional people,
they don't watch TV.
They don't know,

937
00:55:33.930 --> 00:55:36.780
you know,
they're not like absorbed and shit like we are,

938
00:55:36.781 --> 00:55:41.781
they're just out there hunting with giant birds and you know,

939
00:55:41.911 --> 00:55:44.730
they figured out how to do that.
And you know,
that's,

940
00:55:44.731 --> 00:55:46.980
to me all this stuff like horse ride,
any,

941
00:55:46.981 --> 00:55:49.800
any human animal relationship.

942
00:55:50.910 --> 00:55:55.470
When you think back to the first person who saw a falcon and was like,

943
00:55:55.471 --> 00:56:00.471
I'm going to catch it and I'm going to train it to catch rabbits so we can eat.

944
00:56:01.530 --> 00:56:05.370
Yeah.
How?
How,
how,
how that shit is,

945
00:56:06.000 --> 00:56:07.650
I don't know if this is the exact documentary,

946
00:56:07.651 --> 00:56:10.620
but this is one on it called the challenge where

947
00:56:12.330 --> 00:56:17.010
that's not it,
but that's it's,
these are like in their [inaudible] Saudi Arabia.

948
00:56:17.011 --> 00:56:20.250
These are like some sharpening the clause.
I'm sharpen the beak here in a second.

949
00:56:20.400 --> 00:56:23.830
What are they using them to hunt?
It seems like they're having an event here,

950
00:56:24.160 --> 00:56:28.480
so I don't know.
They're sharpening their beak.
What the fuck?
Yeah,

951
00:56:28.481 --> 00:56:31.320
this wasn't it.
This is another version.
They're watching soccer.

952
00:56:31.330 --> 00:56:33.010
They're riding on sand dunes.

953
00:56:33.100 --> 00:56:37.190
These guys are driving land cruisers in the middle of the desert somewhere.
Yeah,

954
00:56:37.290 --> 00:56:39.760
go pros on him and shit.
They're in land cruisers on there.

955
00:56:39.761 --> 00:56:44.380
Letting go pinches the are going to get jacked.
Oh my God.

956
00:56:44.420 --> 00:56:49.360
Oh my God.
They got a room filled with pigeons or those falcons?
Yeah.
Falcons.

957
00:56:49.770 --> 00:56:54.410
Well now is it?
I can't,
which one of the pigeon?
Some of them have to be pigeons,

958
00:56:54.411 --> 00:56:55.630
right?
Those are pigeons.

959
00:56:55.930 --> 00:56:59.620
So what is the challenge like who jacks the most pigeons?
The fuck is that.

960
00:57:00.100 --> 00:57:02.980
Wait a minute.
It's called the challenge.
The movie's called the challenge.

961
00:57:02.981 --> 00:57:06.190
It's a documentary that came out one of words a couple of years ago.
Really?

962
00:57:06.660 --> 00:57:09.250
And it's just about Falcons,
Jack and pigeons.

963
00:57:09.280 --> 00:57:12.910
I thought this was the one he was talking about,
but apparently it's not.

964
00:57:13.050 --> 00:57:17.320
I want to watch it out.
Multiple little falconers sharpening the p,

965
00:57:17.321 --> 00:57:20.770
the beaks and sharpen and the clause.
This is going to be your next thing.

966
00:57:21.130 --> 00:57:23.920
You're going to get into Falcon nearing the next time I come here.

967
00:57:23.921 --> 00:57:26.320
You're going to have a salkin some kind of like

968
00:57:26.860 --> 00:57:29.640
<v 1>when I'm a Mongolian dudes with the first</v>

969
00:57:29.740 --> 00:57:34.240
<v 4>hat,
w the ring,
the fucking spike on the top of it.
That is the one.
That's it.</v>

970
00:57:34.241 --> 00:57:38.050
Mongolian guys driving around with a gun by started about the,
about this movie.

971
00:57:38.170 --> 00:57:41.950
<v 1>Oh Wow.
No Shit.
Yeah,</v>

972
00:57:41.980 --> 00:57:43.510
dudes have crazy money,
man.

973
00:57:44.620 --> 00:57:48.070
They just have to figure out some way to ball so they get killer birds.

974
00:57:48.160 --> 00:57:52.360
Look at those chairs.
Two birds are an amazing thing.
If you,

975
00:57:52.390 --> 00:57:56.680
if you really watch them and see them in the wild,
like do their thing,

976
00:57:56.681 --> 00:57:59.110
like snatch a fish out of the water.

977
00:57:59.920 --> 00:58:02.950
It's what it is is a a raptor.

978
00:58:02.980 --> 00:58:07.930
It's a flying raptor that just,
we tolerate it because it's small,

979
00:58:08.830 --> 00:58:10.840
but we probably killed all the ones that can

980
00:58:10.840 --> 00:58:15.460
<v 4>to kill us.
Well yeah,
right.
They were like giant,
giant Eagle's at some point.</v>

981
00:58:15.570 --> 00:58:20.560
<v 1>Pretty sure eyes on that thing,
man.
Look at that,
look at the eyes on that thing.</v>

982
00:58:21.700 --> 00:58:22.840
It has a giant.

983
00:58:22.870 --> 00:58:27.870
If that was a big thing like the size of you coming at you and trying to kill

984
00:58:28.241 --> 00:58:31.270
you and eat you.
First of all you'd beat totally helpless.

985
00:58:31.540 --> 00:58:32.620
If that thing was your size,

986
00:58:32.621 --> 00:58:36.690
you would be 100% every human being would be 100% helpless.
They,

987
00:58:36.700 --> 00:58:40.330
those things are so strong it would grab a hold of you with its feet.

988
00:58:40.331 --> 00:58:44.020
It would start ripping you apart with that fucking bolt cutter.

989
00:58:44.021 --> 00:58:48.070
It has grown out of it's face.
Yeah.
Fuck man.

990
00:58:48.410 --> 00:58:52.970
<v 4>It would just,
it's just that fucking thing would be the size of a sword.</v>

991
00:58:52.971 --> 00:58:57.971
Like a Samurai sword that would just be smashing in ripping your guts out.

992
00:58:58.251 --> 00:59:01.070
You'd be,
you'd probably still be alive for a second to watch it.

993
00:59:01.071 --> 00:59:04.260
Take a light taste of your guts.
It would probably be,
will it

994
00:59:04.260 --> 00:59:08.230
<v 1>be like the size of one of shacks?
Shoes,</v>

995
00:59:09.010 --> 00:59:13.150
right.
That would be his beak size 22.
Yeah.

996
00:59:13.240 --> 00:59:17.680
Like a beak.
Right.
He looked at his beak.
Big Ass shoe.

997
00:59:17.710 --> 00:59:21.010
Huge knife.
Big fucking head.
Had this big,

998
00:59:21.350 --> 00:59:23.570
big Gash shoe for a frown.

999
00:59:24.450 --> 00:59:27.700
<v 2>Caring.
You defeat its babies.
Right.
That's what they do.</v>

1000
00:59:27.701 --> 00:59:30.690
Did they eat you first and puke you into the baby's mouth?

1001
00:59:30.780 --> 00:59:33.270
<v 1>Yeah.
And they eat other birds to eat whatever the fuck they want.</v>

1002
00:59:33.300 --> 00:59:34.440
Those things are always fun.
You know,

1003
00:59:34.441 --> 00:59:36.480
I used to find them headless in my backyard.

1004
00:59:36.481 --> 00:59:41.080
There was like a little bit of a war between the,
uh,
the hawks in my yard.
Yeah.

1005
00:59:41.100 --> 00:59:45.180
We put it in this glass fence in the back of the yard and the hawks can figure

1006
00:59:45.181 --> 00:59:48.810
out the fence and they fucking Dank and they,

1007
00:59:48.930 --> 00:59:53.280
a couple of them got k out,
one of them,
one of them we managed to save,

1008
00:59:53.340 --> 00:59:56.640
we brought him to like a wildlife rescue place and they rehabilitated him and

1009
00:59:56.641 --> 01:00:00.960
saved him.
But another couple of them died and then we would find dead.

1010
01:00:01.170 --> 01:00:05.430
So I think that one of them was like the dominant Hawk and he died and then

1011
01:00:05.431 --> 01:00:06.930
other ones just start moving into the area.

1012
01:00:06.931 --> 01:00:10.410
Like they were flying around my chicken coop and like little juvenile hawks are

1013
01:00:10.411 --> 01:00:13.050
kind of assholes,
almost like teenagers.
I was like,

1014
01:00:13.051 --> 01:00:14.040
what the fuck is going on here?

1015
01:00:14.041 --> 01:00:17.060
And then I'd find one of them with his head [inaudible] she's just like,

1016
01:00:17.180 --> 01:00:22.180
so like some other Hawk killed it and ripped his fucking head off and a bigger

1017
01:00:22.261 --> 01:00:26.070
hawk left it in my yard.
Dead with no head,
like a message.

1018
01:00:26.170 --> 01:00:28.740
I was trying to figure out what the fuck eat somethings head.

1019
01:00:29.010 --> 01:00:31.680
But apparently that's something that a hawk,
a hawk will do too.

1020
01:00:31.740 --> 01:00:32.700
They'll do to each other.

1021
01:00:33.050 --> 01:00:36.890
<v 2>So it's like the equivalent of like the Mad Max putting your enemy's head on a</v>

1022
01:00:36.891 --> 01:00:38.620
spike in front of your area.
Yeah.

1023
01:00:38.900 --> 01:00:42.980
<v 1>You claim you own like all his friends get to see his headless body when you</v>

1024
01:00:42.981 --> 01:00:47.000
shit on it when you fly over,
find out.
That's true.

1025
01:00:47.240 --> 01:00:50.870
That might be a lie.
You lie to the logs.
It's true.

1026
01:00:50.871 --> 01:00:52.250
But I want to find out if a hawks,

1027
01:00:52.251 --> 01:00:55.160
cause I believe I'm almost were very high right now,
ladies and gentlemen,

1028
01:00:55.430 --> 01:01:00.260
but I'm pretty sure that I read that when I found the headless bird in my yard.

1029
01:01:00.310 --> 01:01:04.690
<v 2>Have you seen the Tibetans sky burial shit?
Yes.
Yeah.
That stuff's cool,
man.</v>

1030
01:01:04.691 --> 01:01:08.950
That's crazy.
Yeah,
it's amazing.
Tell people what it is.
Ah,
that's when you,

1031
01:01:08.951 --> 01:01:12.610
um,
basically,
instead of cremation,

1032
01:01:12.820 --> 01:01:17.820
your friends hack your body up into pieces and take it to where they're vultures

1033
01:01:18.880 --> 01:01:22.720
hazards.
I'm not sure which vultures scatter your body.

1034
01:01:22.960 --> 01:01:24.070
They descend on it,

1035
01:01:24.250 --> 01:01:29.110
they eat it and all that's left is bones even smash the head so that the volts

1036
01:01:29.111 --> 01:01:32.020
you can get inside that gets your brain all your memories.

1037
01:01:32.380 --> 01:01:37.380
And then I just saw this incredible documentary on the history of,

1038
01:01:37.841 --> 01:01:42.130
I think it was the Himalaya civilizations there because like they're

1039
01:01:42.430 --> 01:01:45.370
genetically,
they,
it's why the Sherpas,
they're able to help people,

1040
01:01:45.640 --> 01:01:48.040
like they are able to take oxygen and more,

1041
01:01:48.041 --> 01:01:52.750
there's some kind of split it half right.
And that at that,
that high in altitude,

1042
01:01:52.751 --> 01:01:57.700
but like these fucking crazy scientists were repelling down the side of these

1043
01:01:57.701 --> 01:02:02.701
cliff faces and going into tombs and the side of cliffs and looking at these

1044
01:02:04.931 --> 01:02:08.170
bones of these people where they're not sure of what their history is.

1045
01:02:08.710 --> 01:02:12.370
And like they'd been picked by birds,
you know,
so they were like,
oh,
okay.

1046
01:02:12.371 --> 01:02:15.190
They were doing the sky burial even now.

1047
01:02:15.400 --> 01:02:19.720
But some of them had spikes nailed into,
so I take,

1048
01:02:19.980 --> 01:02:23.880
<v 6>they mailed them through something like,
my God,
maybe there was like a Zombie.</v>

1049
01:02:24.180 --> 01:02:28.890
Like who knows what the fuck happened.
But back then they thought that,
you know,

1050
01:02:29.100 --> 01:02:30.970
I mean even in Western graveyard,

1051
01:02:30.971 --> 01:02:33.300
so you'll find spikes through what part of their audit?

1052
01:02:33.540 --> 01:02:37.710
I think their chest or their heads.
I think somebody killed him.
Oh No,
no,
no.

1053
01:02:37.711 --> 01:02:42.060
Versus post death.
Oh,
part of their ritual.
Yeah.
Yeah,
pretty sure.

1054
01:02:42.090 --> 01:02:46.590
Not for sure,
but pretty sure.
But that was not uncommon.

1055
01:02:46.620 --> 01:02:47.221
I mean we,

1056
01:02:47.221 --> 01:02:52.221
there's so many examples of finding like graves that have spikes hammered in

1057
01:02:52.771 --> 01:02:57.630
them because people thought that the body was a vampire that didn't come from

1058
01:02:57.631 --> 01:02:58.464
nowhere.

1059
01:02:58.740 --> 01:03:03.180
<v 1>Do you think that there was a time when bodies just to come back to life and</v>

1060
01:03:03.181 --> 01:03:05.070
that parasites dead now?
No.

1061
01:03:05.440 --> 01:03:05.860
<v 6>No.</v>

1062
01:03:05.860 --> 01:03:09.370
I think there was a fucking time where people's neo cortex hadn't formed enough

1063
01:03:09.371 --> 01:03:11.560
to separate their subconscious and their conscious.

1064
01:03:11.800 --> 01:03:16.480
So they were like hallucinating more.
And also they were like,

1065
01:03:16.630 --> 01:03:18.070
they had a kind of,

1066
01:03:19.000 --> 01:03:21.910
they were projecting a lot of crazy shit into the world.

1067
01:03:22.030 --> 01:03:27.030
<v 1>Also imagine when you found out you could lie like the first liars because like</v>

1068
01:03:28.500 --> 01:03:30.900
there were people that would have language and then people,

1069
01:03:30.930 --> 01:03:33.180
once they started communicating like,
hey,

1070
01:03:33.900 --> 01:03:37.080
who fucking ate the tomatoes now me.

1071
01:03:38.000 --> 01:03:39.600
And you realize you can get away with that.
Yeah.

1072
01:03:39.690 --> 01:03:43.860
You could lie and say he didn't eat tomatoes when you did.
Who's the first liar?

1073
01:03:43.980 --> 01:03:48.870
Cause before language there was no liars.
There's no liars in the Lion Kingdom.

1074
01:03:49.620 --> 01:03:51.520
It's not even a concept because you,

1075
01:03:51.521 --> 01:03:54.330
you can't have aligned until you have communication.
Well

1076
01:03:54.470 --> 01:03:55.111
<v 6>you could say there's the,</v>

1077
01:03:55.111 --> 01:04:00.111
I guess you could say lying is the equivalent of camouflage in the sense that

1078
01:04:00.470 --> 01:04:04.410
when you see a,
some of these insane like uh,

1079
01:04:04.760 --> 01:04:09.590
animals but bugs in particular that look like flowers that look like,

1080
01:04:09.980 --> 01:04:12.770
you know,
yeah.
That's a lie.
It's a form of deception.

1081
01:04:12.771 --> 01:04:16.100
It's a form of evolutionary deception.
So yeah,

1082
01:04:16.101 --> 01:04:18.500
I think that like it's a linguistic,

1083
01:04:18.560 --> 01:04:23.480
it's a linguistic camouflage that people use to try to like navigate through

1084
01:04:23.481 --> 01:04:26.540
society,
not just people,
monkeys and monkeys

1085
01:04:27.130 --> 01:04:28.920
<v 1>language.
And they lie to each other.
Yeah.</v>

1086
01:04:28.990 --> 01:04:32.350
They found out that monkeys have a very specific sound they make when it's an

1087
01:04:32.351 --> 01:04:36.640
eagle and they have an other sound that they make when it's a cat,

1088
01:04:37.070 --> 01:04:38.410
like something on the ground.

1089
01:04:39.040 --> 01:04:42.130
So they have something for a pie and something on the ground.

1090
01:04:42.370 --> 01:04:46.020
And so one monkey will yell out something like,
Oh,

1091
01:04:46.021 --> 01:04:47.260
and eagles come on the other monkeys,
you

1092
01:04:47.260 --> 01:04:51.180
<v 6>scattered.
And then he gets the fruit.
Yeah,
it's crazy.</v>

1093
01:04:53.010 --> 01:04:55.290
And then they'll,
they'll yell at somethings on the ground,

1094
01:04:55.291 --> 01:04:56.280
they'll run up to the trees,

1095
01:04:56.310 --> 01:05:00.630
they lie to each other to meet what the funniest fucking thing is,

1096
01:05:00.631 --> 01:05:04.860
how much we lie to ourselves.
That's where it gets amazing.
It's like,

1097
01:05:05.510 --> 01:05:06.630
you know,
you were talking about,

1098
01:05:06.870 --> 01:05:11.010
and I've done the exact same thing with screen time when you're presented that

1099
01:05:11.011 --> 01:05:14.670
humiliating number of hours and you've been telling friends you're busy and

1100
01:05:14.671 --> 01:05:17.390
you're fucking looking at that and just thinking like,
dude,
I've been like,

1101
01:05:17.990 --> 01:05:21.710
<v 2>you know,
looking at bullshit.
But then before you do that,
you know like,</v>

1102
01:05:21.740 --> 01:05:25.460
but it's my job.
You know,
I've got to kind of be online.
It's like,
no,

1103
01:05:25.730 --> 01:05:30.710
you're addicted to technology and because you can't stand the fact that you

1104
01:05:30.711 --> 01:05:33.440
don't have the discipline to stop using it,

1105
01:05:33.620 --> 01:05:38.620
you would rather make up a story involving some absolutely verifiable bullshit

1106
01:05:39.920 --> 01:05:43.640
so that you don't have to deal with the fact that you aren't in full control of

1107
01:05:43.641 --> 01:05:44.400
yourself

1108
01:05:44.400 --> 01:05:47.640
<v 1>and this a non rewarding addiction,
which is really strange.</v>

1109
01:05:47.670 --> 01:05:51.730
It's like when you looking at stories on like the apple news feed or something

1110
01:05:51.731 --> 01:05:54.330
that you're scrolling looking for something that's going to captivate you.

1111
01:05:54.740 --> 01:05:57.210
What does,
oh,
the apple having problems with the keyboards.

1112
01:05:57.910 --> 01:06:01.100
He started reading this and it's like,
oh,
you can walk away kids.

1113
01:06:01.101 --> 01:06:05.310
So luck call us anymore.
Like how much of that am I like you were saying earlier,

1114
01:06:05.340 --> 01:06:09.210
how much of that is junk thoughts?
Yeah,
he's a junk thoughts like junk food,

1115
01:06:09.420 --> 01:06:12.420
junk food.
You're just consuming,
consuming

1116
01:06:13.330 --> 01:06:16.420
<v 2>and I don't think it's useless.
I think it serves that purpose.
Some of it does.</v>

1117
01:06:16.810 --> 01:06:20.230
I mean in the sense of maybe not a purpose in the way you're going to be as a

1118
01:06:20.231 --> 01:06:20.980
human,

1119
01:06:20.980 --> 01:06:25.980
but a purpose in the sense of like if you apply a little bit of like mindfulness

1120
01:06:28.091 --> 01:06:30.760
when you're using your phone,
how do I feel right now?

1121
01:06:30.790 --> 01:06:32.500
You know what I'm talking about?
Like how do I fucking feel?

1122
01:06:33.490 --> 01:06:37.750
You realize you feel a specific way.
It's a kind of like numbness.

1123
01:06:37.780 --> 01:06:42.780
There's a quality of like a kind of like sedated numbness to the hypnotic state

1124
01:06:43.511 --> 01:06:48.430
you've been lulled into by the algorithms and there's some pleasant kind of
like,

1125
01:06:48.730 --> 01:06:53.650
I guess you could compare it to some like low level you fork painkiller,

1126
01:06:53.651 --> 01:06:55.330
but not very euphoric,

1127
01:06:55.331 --> 01:07:00.331
mostly just a mild numbness that is pretty good at turning off anxiety and this,

1128
01:07:02.720 --> 01:07:05.380
or you could at least this place your own personal anxiety.

1129
01:07:05.380 --> 01:07:09.940
Like if I'm scanning through my phone and I find the inevitable bad news,

1130
01:07:10.330 --> 01:07:11.710
whatever form it's in,

1131
01:07:12.160 --> 01:07:16.720
I can pretend that my anxiety is related to that news.

1132
01:07:17.140 --> 01:07:20.890
You know?
And then that's when you get people who are very anxious and they,

1133
01:07:21.010 --> 01:07:24.970
I've seen it,
I mean size who is a famous,
some person tweeted,

1134
01:07:25.690 --> 01:07:30.250
I'm here in this beautiful place and I can't enjoy it because of our president.

1135
01:07:31.120 --> 01:07:33.310
You know what I mean?
It's like,
Whoa,
I don't,

1136
01:07:33.311 --> 01:07:38.311
I'm not sure that's the real reason why you can enjoy that place.

1137
01:07:39.940 --> 01:07:44.590
I think it might be actually that you haven't dealt with the fact that you're a

1138
01:07:44.591 --> 01:07:48.460
vet,
you're freaking the fuck out.
Right.
That to me is like this.

1139
01:07:48.461 --> 01:07:49.630
The purpose of a phone.

1140
01:07:49.631 --> 01:07:53.620
It's very good at tricking yourself into thinking that the reason you feel like

1141
01:07:53.621 --> 01:07:56.810
shit is because of something happening in the world.
It's about the

1142
01:07:56.840 --> 01:07:59.560
<v 1>bandwidth either too.
And here's what the problem with that is.</v>

1143
01:07:59.650 --> 01:08:03.070
Sometimes you have like these legitimate thoughts and when you have these

1144
01:08:03.071 --> 01:08:07.450
legitimate thoughts,
meaning like
a meeting,
like something you're working on,

1145
01:08:08.380 --> 01:08:10.920
something you are,
you're like,
whether it's a,

1146
01:08:10.930 --> 01:08:14.110
an idea you're trying to do on stage or something else on another project that

1147
01:08:14.111 --> 01:08:18.570
you're doing these things,
they require your bandwidth.
Right.

1148
01:08:18.600 --> 01:08:22.260
And when you are always looking at your phone,
it chips away.

1149
01:08:22.261 --> 01:08:26.700
Percentages of your bandwidth.
10 here,
five there.
Yeah,
20 there at seven there.

1150
01:08:26.880 --> 01:08:28.060
And you don't think about it because Nope,

1151
01:08:28.080 --> 01:08:30.690
I'm still concentrating on the project.
I'm still on the project,
the project,

1152
01:08:30.691 --> 01:08:33.390
the project,
the project.
But really,
no,
really,

1153
01:08:33.391 --> 01:08:36.420
you're in two rivers at the same time.

1154
01:08:36.600 --> 01:08:41.520
You're in this wacky river of nonsense and wondering who got this and how much

1155
01:08:41.521 --> 01:08:44.730
they're getting in this divorce and who died and the Dominican Republic.

1156
01:08:44.730 --> 01:08:48.330
Oh my God.
Another person,
another tourist.
Oh my God.
Yeah.
You know,

1157
01:08:48.331 --> 01:08:49.500
and you're just,
you,

1158
01:08:49.560 --> 01:08:54.560
if you want to look at all the bad stuff that happens amongst 7 billion people,

1159
01:08:55.291 --> 01:08:58.320
you have to think of all the interactions that humans have.
Yeah.

1160
01:08:58.530 --> 01:09:03.450
All the literally billions of interactions every day.

1161
01:09:03.480 --> 01:09:07.890
People constantly and occasionally one goes fucking western.
Yeah.

1162
01:09:07.920 --> 01:09:11.310
One goes sideways and that's the one you see on Youtube.
Jesus Christ.

1163
01:09:11.311 --> 01:09:12.510
This world's going to shit.

1164
01:09:12.660 --> 01:09:15.130
And then you watch another one and you watch another one.

1165
01:09:15.160 --> 01:09:19.320
You Watch infectious diseases and snake bites.

1166
01:09:19.321 --> 01:09:24.321
And what happens when you get net net cropsey when you fucking fleshed starts

1167
01:09:24.360 --> 01:09:28.110
falling off a flesh eating bacteria.
Say how'd they get that snorkeling?

1168
01:09:28.310 --> 01:09:32.040
And the next thing you know,
you're fucking just numb,

1169
01:09:32.130 --> 01:09:36.990
numb to your real life because you're taking in data from everywhere.

1170
01:09:37.080 --> 01:09:37.730
Yeah,

1171
01:09:37.730 --> 01:09:40.830
<v 2>that's it.
Fuck man.
And it's like it.</v>

1172
01:09:40.880 --> 01:09:44.630
Then that gets inside of you and now you're just a turbulent.

1173
01:09:44.690 --> 01:09:49.610
You have a turbulent self that is digested a version of the world that's only

1174
01:09:49.610 --> 01:09:51.470
half true.
And so because of that,

1175
01:09:51.680 --> 01:09:56.680
you're going to be half a person because you are not looking into like your own

1176
01:09:58.250 --> 01:10:03.130
whatever the fuck you are.
You know,
what are you,
what are you like that?

1177
01:10:03.170 --> 01:10:05.840
How much do you even think about?
What are you,
yeah,

1178
01:10:05.870 --> 01:10:10.870
how much time have you spent to me it's like the craziest shit that like you're,

1179
01:10:12.380 --> 01:10:12.701
you're,
we,

1180
01:10:12.701 --> 01:10:17.701
we're talking about the sex drive being this insane compulsory engine inside

1181
01:10:19.460 --> 01:10:23.960
every sentient being that way that I know of him.
Of course there's exceptions,

1182
01:10:24.140 --> 01:10:28.640
but like this is,
if you're writing a computer code,
right?

1183
01:10:28.940 --> 01:10:32.360
This would be a line of code,
right?
It keeps you going,
keeps you going,

1184
01:10:32.361 --> 01:10:36.680
keeps you going.
So to me,
something that's fucking astounding,

1185
01:10:37.160 --> 01:10:38.330
Lee,
weird is,

1186
01:10:38.660 --> 01:10:43.660
why the fuck can people not sit still and be quiet for periods exceeding 10

1187
01:10:45.351 --> 01:10:48.200
minutes,
20 minutes,
30 minutes,

1188
01:10:48.440 --> 01:10:53.360
literally the least metabolically outside of sleeping,

1189
01:10:53.510 --> 01:10:54.343
right?
You're,
you're,

1190
01:10:54.450 --> 01:10:57.140
you're not really exerting energy when you're sitting still and being quiet.

1191
01:10:57.440 --> 01:11:01.760
You're,
uh,
not really doing much.
And yet if you ask,

1192
01:11:01.761 --> 01:11:05.090
I get asked a person if they wanted to go for a walk that was,

1193
01:11:05.091 --> 01:11:06.410
sure I'll go for a walk.
But if you're like,

1194
01:11:06.440 --> 01:11:11.030
do you want to sit with me for like 10 minutes quietly?
It's weird.
I get it.

1195
01:11:11.390 --> 01:11:14.240
I was like,
no,
I don't want to.
I'm not into,
no,
I don't want to do that.

1196
01:11:14.630 --> 01:11:18.080
What the fuck is that to me that if,

1197
01:11:18.081 --> 01:11:19.790
not that I believe in simulation theory,

1198
01:11:19.791 --> 01:11:22.910
but if I wanted to prove it or like play around with it,

1199
01:11:22.940 --> 01:11:26.210
the idea that we're like non player characters and some super advanced
simulator,

1200
01:11:26.750 --> 01:11:31.520
one of the ways I would experiment would be like,
oh,
sit still.

1201
01:11:31.940 --> 01:11:35.600
Why the fuck can't you sit still?
Why is it that suddenly your mind goes insane?

1202
01:11:35.601 --> 01:11:37.070
Why is it suddenly that you got to get out?

1203
01:11:37.071 --> 01:11:42.071
Why do you feel bored or crazy or fucking like over heated or anxious or

1204
01:11:42.231 --> 01:11:45.650
nervous?
He Productive Dunkin.
Yeah.
That's why.

1205
01:11:45.651 --> 01:11:50.240
That's why everybody wants stimulants.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Wouldn't it be more productive?

1206
01:11:50.650 --> 01:11:54.180
You want to contribute more people?
I mean,
I think it's,

1207
01:11:54.230 --> 01:11:56.720
that's what someone might say as an explanation,

1208
01:11:57.110 --> 01:12:02.110
but I think the fucking real reason is like people are carrying a disordered

1209
01:12:03.320 --> 01:12:04.730
universe inside of them.

1210
01:12:05.210 --> 01:12:09.950
And when they sit down and there's nothing to look at except what's around them,

1211
01:12:10.520 --> 01:12:15.290
they're forced to deal with the fact that actually a lot of the disturbance in

1212
01:12:15.291 --> 01:12:16.124
their life,

1213
01:12:16.460 --> 01:12:21.460
it's more related to an interior like Maelstrom of thoughts and,

1214
01:12:22.730 --> 01:12:24.680
and explored feelings.

1215
01:12:24.980 --> 01:12:29.210
And then this is just basically shaping their entire existence there,

1216
01:12:29.450 --> 01:12:30.950
like in every single moment,

1217
01:12:30.951 --> 01:12:35.900
recreating a universe of disorder and then getting really upset because if you

1218
01:12:35.901 --> 01:12:39.770
see this order in the world and it keeps reappearing like your friend,
he's like,

1219
01:12:39.950 --> 01:12:43.700
why do I get taken in by these people all the time?
It's like,
Whoa,

1220
01:12:43.701 --> 01:12:47.870
you could take it in by these people all the time because inside of you is a

1221
01:12:47.871 --> 01:12:52.871
behavior pattern that is replicating this a phenomena and you're pretending that

1222
01:12:54.111 --> 01:12:57.860
it's not in you to the point where it's a mystery.
It's like,

1223
01:12:58.040 --> 01:13:00.530
why did you know when I drive somewhere,
I'm not like,

1224
01:13:00.531 --> 01:13:02.720
why did my car drive me here?
You know,

1225
01:13:02.750 --> 01:13:04.840
unless I'm like fucking high out of my mind and should

1226
01:13:04.920 --> 01:13:09.250
<v 4>be driving,
get nuber man.</v>

1227
01:13:09.530 --> 01:13:13.070
You know what I mean?
But pull over and find a Starbucks.
A person will legitimate

1228
01:13:13.080 --> 01:13:16.920
<v 2>Emily be like,
I don't know why I did that.
And it's like</v>

1229
01:13:16.990 --> 01:13:19.900
<v 4>w w w what is,
what are you?
What are you?</v>

1230
01:13:20.810 --> 01:13:25.720
Are you something different if you have sugar in your gut?
Yeah.
Are you?
Yeah.

1231
01:13:25.770 --> 01:13:29.980
What?
When you're Ken DDA level hits a certain number.

1232
01:13:30.730 --> 01:13:33.160
Yeah,
and it starts telling you need sugar.
Dunkin.

1233
01:13:33.610 --> 01:13:36.360
How about a nice cold Cocacola Dunkin?
Yeah.

1234
01:13:36.740 --> 01:13:39.670
Duncan just crack a one one coke.
It's not going to hurt you to have one.

1235
01:13:39.740 --> 01:13:42.460
You're right.
I need a cake to go along with water.

1236
01:13:42.461 --> 01:13:45.460
Who wants to go and buy water when it's right next to the coke?

1237
01:13:45.490 --> 01:13:50.250
Nasty fucking waters.
Flavorless layer.
It's boom.

1238
01:13:50.320 --> 01:13:53.080
Spillover.
Stay live here with my water.

1239
01:13:53.240 --> 01:13:58.240
I want fucking sewage brown and sugar death poured into my fucking guts or a

1240
01:14:00.401 --> 01:14:04.630
nice IPA.
Oh yeah,
he's bitter yellow liquid.

1241
01:14:04.870 --> 01:14:05.950
It tastes like wheat.

1242
01:14:06.260 --> 01:14:10.590
<v 2>Yeah.
Wait,
I did having an addictive personality,
man.</v>

1243
01:14:10.620 --> 01:14:12.110
I like because it's like

1244
01:14:12.110 --> 01:14:14.060
<v 6>it's fun to play around with it.</v>

1245
01:14:14.150 --> 01:14:18.080
Meaning that when I am reaching for the thing,
whatever it may be,

1246
01:14:18.081 --> 01:14:21.200
that I know I shouldn't be doing in the sense of fun.

1247
01:14:21.420 --> 01:14:26.420
Well I like watching the rationalization that my mind starts spitting out for

1248
01:14:26.511 --> 01:14:30.830
it.
You know,
like,
Oh,
I'm doing this because it's like,
you know,
I'm relaxing.

1249
01:14:31.250 --> 01:14:32.810
You know,
it's a celebratory moment.

1250
01:14:33.020 --> 01:14:36.800
I feel a little bummed out and you look at like the instant way your mind tries

1251
01:14:36.801 --> 01:14:41.450
to come up with a bullshit story to write off the fact that you are riding

1252
01:14:41.451 --> 01:14:46.451
around in a vehicle that you can't control and that is not a very appealing way

1253
01:14:48.740 --> 01:14:53.150
to be.
No one wants to hear the pilot say,
guys,

1254
01:14:53.570 --> 01:14:55.580
taking my hands off the wheel.

1255
01:14:55.581 --> 01:14:58.430
Once you see what happens for the next 10 minutes up here,

1256
01:14:58.700 --> 01:15:00.980
and yet their whole lives are like that.

1257
01:15:01.130 --> 01:15:02.930
They was taking their hands off the wheel,

1258
01:15:03.080 --> 01:15:05.300
but then they're trying to make sense of it.
You know?

1259
01:15:05.301 --> 01:15:09.020
Like how many times do you mean alcoholic who hasn't accepted yet?

1260
01:15:09.021 --> 01:15:13.000
They're an alcoholic and they were like telling you all these reasons for why

1261
01:15:13.450 --> 01:15:18.250
you'd see my childhood,
man,
you just got to understand my childhood or you know,

1262
01:15:18.260 --> 01:15:19.430
it helps my writing.

1263
01:15:20.150 --> 01:15:24.680
I'm a better writer when I'm drunk or on and on and on and on.
And it's like,
no.

1264
01:15:24.681 --> 01:15:27.680
The reality is you're fucking hooked.
You're addicted.

1265
01:15:27.860 --> 01:15:32.480
You can't stop your hand from bringing something into your fucking mouth and you

1266
01:15:32.481 --> 01:15:36.110
can't deal with that because who wants to deal with that shit?
Man,

1267
01:15:36.320 --> 01:15:41.060
I want to be in control.
So I'll make up a story.
I'll make up a story.

1268
01:15:41.480 --> 01:15:46.040
I love watching your shit,
man.
That Goggins what's his name?
Oh,
he's great.

1269
01:15:46.041 --> 01:15:49.910
I love him forwarding laziness globally.

1270
01:15:49.910 --> 01:15:54.650
This guy's galloping down the road yelling into the camera and I love it,

1271
01:15:54.651 --> 01:15:58.070
man.
It's especially as a person who's really good at telling stories,
you know?

1272
01:15:58.071 --> 01:16:02.090
So like I'll fucking wake up in the morning.
I'll be like,
yeah,

1273
01:16:02.091 --> 01:16:06.500
there's time to go for a jog.
But you know,

1274
01:16:06.530 --> 01:16:10.490
I probably should fill in the fucking blank.
And it's always very important,

1275
01:16:10.520 --> 01:16:14.540
you know?
There's always a real good reason for it.
Like it,
but regardless,

1276
01:16:14.541 --> 01:16:19.541
the truth is I have yet to achieve the ability to grab that particular part of

1277
01:16:20.121 --> 01:16:22.700
the steering mechanism of the my identity,
you know?

1278
01:16:22.940 --> 01:16:25.520
And so rather than just deal with it.
Yeah,
you can't control yourself.

1279
01:16:26.030 --> 01:16:30.190
I'll tell myself a story.
I love that.
It's a tricky one.
Yeah,
it is.
That one.

1280
01:16:30.191 --> 01:16:31.520
The comfort one's a tricky one.

1281
01:16:32.510 --> 01:16:36.430
<v 7>Comfort is the siren.
Come on,
come back to the couch.</v>

1282
01:16:36.431 --> 01:16:40.010
Tongue come in and done gay learn.

1283
01:16:40.360 --> 01:16:45.320
But a nice cup of tea.
Tea is no vice.
It's actually good for you.
It's herbal.

1284
01:16:45.710 --> 01:16:50.180
Just relax a little tea.
So let's see.
Well,
ketamine,
read this.

1285
01:16:50.650 --> 01:16:52.490
Don't read the New York Times.

1286
01:16:53.180 --> 01:16:57.020
Find out what the end intellectuals think about the way the world is.
Yeah,
right,

1287
01:16:57.021 --> 01:17:01.220
man,
it's amazing.
I love buying things to do,
man.
I don't,
you know,

1288
01:17:01.221 --> 01:17:02.900
I don't sit down and listen to music.

1289
01:17:02.940 --> 01:17:06.740
I want to sit down and listen to some albums.
Well,
I need to because you know,

1290
01:17:07.140 --> 01:17:10.040
I'm just interested in music and I'm of like making

1291
01:17:10.040 --> 01:17:12.080
<v 2>some songs and I want to become inspired.</v>

1292
01:17:13.610 --> 01:17:15.680
<v 1>I think a lot when I'm running in this,</v>

1293
01:17:15.681 --> 01:17:19.520
one of the main reasons why are really liked to do it first thing in the morning

1294
01:17:19.700 --> 01:17:24.620
kind of gets my head going.
Like it gets me ramped up real early.

1295
01:17:24.800 --> 01:17:28.010
I have to do it like first thing in the morning because it gets your head

1296
01:17:28.011 --> 01:17:30.260
thinking.
Yeah.
Like it gets you,
like you're out there,

1297
01:17:31.410 --> 01:17:34.040
breathe in and running up the hill and you're pushing yourself,

1298
01:17:34.041 --> 01:17:36.710
you're tired and then thought will come into your head,
you know,

1299
01:17:36.711 --> 01:17:38.900
just out of nowhere and you get a strange idea.

1300
01:17:38.901 --> 01:17:42.200
Just pop into your head and then you start dancing around with that idea.

1301
01:17:42.201 --> 01:17:45.410
I'm wondering why even thinking about that now and you start thinking about,

1302
01:17:45.411 --> 01:17:47.960
shit,
you need to fix that.
I gotta clean my fucking office.

1303
01:17:47.961 --> 01:17:50.590
And you just want it and thinking about,
oh,
why did I,

1304
01:17:50.591 --> 01:17:55.040
I gotta call that guy back fuck.
And all these like,
it's like brain maintenance.

1305
01:17:55.041 --> 01:17:57.920
Like your brain's like shaking from all the pounding.
It's like,
hey,

1306
01:17:57.921 --> 01:18:01.100
we got to lose screw over here.
And I'm like,
Oh yeah,

1307
01:18:01.101 --> 01:18:03.500
I forgot I got to call that guy on.
Tighten that bitch down.

1308
01:18:03.610 --> 01:18:05.740
<v 2>Yeah man that I this,</v>

1309
01:18:05.770 --> 01:18:10.630
this is what I love about meditating and uh,
that's something I am,

1310
01:18:10.780 --> 01:18:14.770
I finally have figured out how to do regularly and uh,
I love it.

1311
01:18:14.980 --> 01:18:19.000
Oh often doing every day.
That's awesome.
Every day.
How much time?
20 minutes.

1312
01:18:19.210 --> 01:18:23.170
How much time do you jerk off during the meditation?
Oh God man.

1313
01:18:23.171 --> 01:18:25.990
You know it varies based on the weather.
It's so fucking

1314
01:18:28.130 --> 01:18:31.720
Barain made you horny.
Just getting set and don't want to beat off.

1315
01:18:31.800 --> 01:18:33.220
She's here when it's raining.

1316
01:18:33.221 --> 01:18:37.120
It's just like I come faster but then like if it's windy I can't get up.

1317
01:18:37.200 --> 01:18:41.220
<v 1>If there was a movie about someone who just became a fucking NYMPHOMANIAC when</v>

1318
01:18:41.221 --> 01:18:43.860
it rained out,
I'm sure that happens.

1319
01:18:43.980 --> 01:18:48.870
Like as soon as it rains out it's like fuck a good book.
If there was,

1320
01:18:48.871 --> 01:18:51.480
if that's how,
I mean you think about humans,

1321
01:18:52.050 --> 01:18:55.740
how we're affected by things like depressed when it rains up

1322
01:18:55.980 --> 01:18:58.230
<v 2>or you know,
we don't like I did now again,</v>

1323
01:18:58.260 --> 01:19:02.040
definitely I just feel like saying this shit cause you get attacked by

1324
01:19:02.041 --> 01:19:05.190
scientists are smart.
People are like,
you don't know what you're talking about.

1325
01:19:05.370 --> 01:19:07.230
I know.
I don't know what I'm talking about.
I don't either.

1326
01:19:07.350 --> 01:19:09.840
We're talking about a hypothetical world where people get horny when it rains.

1327
01:19:09.870 --> 01:19:12.360
Well yeah,
but I want to take it into the sun man.

1328
01:19:12.361 --> 01:19:13.620
I want to move it to the next level,

1329
01:19:13.621 --> 01:19:16.170
which is like where does solar minimum now apparently,

1330
01:19:16.171 --> 01:19:19.470
which is the sun is not very active and so the sun

1331
01:19:24.010 --> 01:19:28.710
also scientists and you're telling me this,
it's the craziest shit man.

1332
01:19:28.860 --> 01:19:32.130
The son freaks me out.
Not just like the fact there is a son,

1333
01:19:32.131 --> 01:19:36.990
but the solar observatory,
the shit that happened up at that solar is ever Terry.

1334
01:19:37.910 --> 01:19:41.760
I'm high.
I can't even say observatory.
Observatory.

1335
01:19:42.560 --> 01:19:45.660
Turn the turn.
The bubbles on please.
The bubbles.

1336
01:19:46.710 --> 01:19:49.870
What's happening in the solar observatory?
You heard about this shit to happen.

1337
01:19:49.871 --> 01:19:52.710
There's this solar observatory that just got fucking shut down.

1338
01:19:52.711 --> 01:19:56.720
All of a sudden like the black helicopters came in and like,
anyway,

1339
01:19:56.790 --> 01:19:57.720
I don't know what happened there,

1340
01:19:57.721 --> 01:20:01.470
but down the sun is at a solar minimum right now.
Look,

1341
01:20:01.471 --> 01:20:03.940
we have to fucking get through a paywall.
You saw me.

1342
01:20:04.810 --> 01:20:08.480
<v 1>What is this?
Oh you to,
Oh,
I'm tired</v>

1343
01:20:08.520 --> 01:20:11.670
<v 2>guys.
Alright,
continue.
What do they want?</v>

1344
01:20:12.740 --> 01:20:17.540
<v 3>Fucks UFO sightings.
Nasa Soho space probe spots.</v>

1345
01:20:17.570 --> 01:20:20.420
Giant alien disc shoot out of hollow son.

1346
01:20:20.580 --> 01:20:22.510
<v 2>What?
That's not a rule.</v>

1347
01:20:23.640 --> 01:20:28.620
This Express Duncan.
That's like,
that's the hardcore scientific staff.

1348
01:20:28.621 --> 01:20:29.880
Take me to like something.

1349
01:20:30.310 --> 01:20:31.300
<v 3>Yeah.
Who is,
uh,</v>

1350
01:20:31.390 --> 01:20:35.770
is the express like the daily mail did they make who makes stuff up like the

1351
01:20:35.771 --> 01:20:40.480
acquirer or someone?
This was the newspaper wasn't daily and Gizmodo.

1352
01:20:40.510 --> 01:20:45.290
That's my total solar eclipse will pass right over a space observatory.
Oh

1353
01:20:45.400 --> 01:20:48.550
<v 2>Wow.
So have you really not heard about the solar observatory that got shut down?</v>

1354
01:20:48.551 --> 01:20:52.630
I'm surprised pretty.
The pictures.
Will you look that up?
Just solar observatory.

1355
01:20:52.680 --> 01:20:56.860
Shutdown black helicopters.
Go back to that photo real quick.
Before we do that,

1356
01:20:56.890 --> 01:21:01.120
we'll do that real quick.
Sorry.
Asking,
Lord,
is he?
No,
no,
it's okay.
I'm very sorry.

1357
01:21:01.180 --> 01:21:02.440
But look at that God damn

1358
01:21:02.440 --> 01:21:03.273
<v 3>photo.</v>

1359
01:21:03.400 --> 01:21:08.230
This is photo of the solar eclipse and you see all the rays of the sun.

1360
01:21:08.830 --> 01:21:12.860
By the way,
imagine if these were little multi verses.
Each instance.

1361
01:21:12.870 --> 01:21:16.480
Are we out of juice?
This,
this thing just devour bubble.

1362
01:21:16.690 --> 01:21:19.690
<v 2>We got run out of fucking bubbles.
We ran out of bubbles,
right?</v>

1363
01:21:19.691 --> 01:21:22.600
When you're about to talk about the multiverse,
look at the rays coming

1364
01:21:22.600 --> 01:21:25.480
<v 3>you off that thing.
I mean,
what is that?
Is that what that is?</v>

1365
01:21:25.510 --> 01:21:29.560
That although solar rays,
is that,
what the fuck is that coming off of that thing?

1366
01:21:30.060 --> 01:21:33.530
<v 2>Those are called Zeit Gar spirals.</v>

1367
01:21:37.800 --> 01:21:40.950
Those they'll fuck you up,
man.
Yeah,
they're deadly.

1368
01:21:40.980 --> 01:21:44.010
They're like definitely one of the most dangerous thing in face.

1369
01:21:44.210 --> 01:21:46.010
<v 3>Yo,
that's what,
uh,
Robert Schoch,</v>

1370
01:21:46.040 --> 01:21:49.370
the geologist from Boston University thinks and did the ice age.

1371
01:21:49.610 --> 01:21:54.610
His theory is that it was a mass coronal ejection that caused lightening storms

1372
01:21:55.160 --> 01:21:58.340
like rain coming down,
but lightning all over the earth.

1373
01:21:58.570 --> 01:22:01.990
<v 2>It's a very common fear.
And preppers.
Do you watch preppers?</v>

1374
01:22:02.710 --> 01:22:04.860
I've watched it a couple times,
but it freaks me out.
The got,

1375
01:22:04.870 --> 01:22:06.100
everybody's got a reason.

1376
01:22:06.101 --> 01:22:10.090
Like I'm building this shelter because I'm afraid of hurricanes.
But yeah,

1377
01:22:10.091 --> 01:22:14.770
you hear like just the liberals,
the hurricanes elegant,
the sun comes up a lot.

1378
01:22:14.771 --> 01:22:16.540
Like I should.
Well,
I mean,

1379
01:22:17.780 --> 01:22:21.050
<v 3>look,
we can only exist in a very narrow temperature band.</v>

1380
01:22:21.230 --> 01:22:24.770
That's what you have to think is strange.
You know,
we have a temperature band.

1381
01:22:24.771 --> 01:22:25.460
What is it?

1382
01:22:25.460 --> 01:22:29.990
It's from like fucking 20 below zero to like 150.

1383
01:22:30.080 --> 01:22:33.410
That's all we got this,
we got this weird little spot.

1384
01:22:33.680 --> 01:22:37.220
This piece of shit die already.
God dammit.

1385
01:22:39.590 --> 01:22:41.270
How much,
how much juice does it use?

1386
01:22:41.350 --> 01:22:44.190
<v 2>Well,
it's got a little observatory in here,
uh,
not observed</v>

1387
01:22:46.750 --> 01:22:50.930
reservoir,
tiny solar observatory and it's getting shut down.

1388
01:22:51.190 --> 01:22:52.990
It's um,
hmm.

1389
01:22:53.310 --> 01:22:56.970
<v 3>You know,
the,
the,
the narrow band that we can live in,</v>

1390
01:22:57.030 --> 01:23:01.200
we're so fragile as an organism that we should be terrified of this giant

1391
01:23:01.260 --> 01:23:04.140
nuclear explosion that's a million times bigger than the earth.
Sure.

1392
01:23:04.170 --> 01:23:07.050
That we need to stay and need.
We need to keep,
I mean,

1393
01:23:07.230 --> 01:23:12.230
imagine relying on that thing to make sure the temperature is in like a range of

1394
01:23:12.810 --> 01:23:16.890
plus or minus 100 degrees.
Like what the fuck are you talking about?

1395
01:23:17.970 --> 01:23:20.400
That's crazy.
Crazy,
crazy requests.

1396
01:23:20.670 --> 01:23:23.430
<v 2>Well this is like,
you know,
I don't believe it man,</v>

1397
01:23:23.610 --> 01:23:27.810
but I love hollow earth theory.
Here we go.
Oh yeah,
baby.
And like bubbles.

1398
01:23:28.350 --> 01:23:32.070
If I,
if aliens were watching guys like terrestrial aliens,

1399
01:23:32.310 --> 01:23:35.190
not interdimensional aliens porn to make the distinction.

1400
01:23:35.550 --> 01:23:39.360
If terrestrial aliens are watching us,
I think they would be like,

1401
01:23:39.420 --> 01:23:43.140
what the fuck is wrong with you?
Y'All live on the outside of the thing.

1402
01:23:43.550 --> 01:23:47.280
You got to go in.
Why don't cause mountains fall out of the sky?

1403
01:23:47.490 --> 01:23:50.460
You're going to build your whole inside collapse.
Well,

1404
01:23:50.461 --> 01:23:54.300
I'm saying like if you dig deep enough,
maybe there's a way no air down there.

1405
01:23:54.600 --> 01:23:59.370
Well that's,
you got to get air down there.
I mean,

1406
01:23:59.371 --> 01:24:00.810
it is,
when you think about it,

1407
01:24:00.811 --> 01:24:05.811
it's like we've built this fragile civilization using this super advanced brand

1408
01:24:06.631 --> 01:24:11.631
new inter connective technological matrix that is dependent on satellites giving

1409
01:24:13.201 --> 01:24:15.750
gps coordinates to keep everything running.

1410
01:24:15.990 --> 01:24:20.990
And we're right next to a ball of fire that has historically from time to time

1411
01:24:23.160 --> 01:24:26.820
blasted so much fucking crazy shit at our planet.

1412
01:24:27.060 --> 01:24:30.540
There was a time that it caused like telegram wires to spark.

1413
01:24:30.810 --> 01:24:35.400
It's like if that shit hits the satellites,
they're going to go out.
Oh,

1414
01:24:35.401 --> 01:24:38.880
the power grid goes down,
everything goes down.
It's not conspiracy theory.

1415
01:24:38.881 --> 01:24:40.140
It's happened.
Yeah.

1416
01:24:40.170 --> 01:24:45.170
And sometimes it cools down and it enters into a thing called a grand solar

1417
01:24:45.990 --> 01:24:49.980
minimum I think is what it's called.
And that's sometimes starts ice ages.

1418
01:24:49.981 --> 01:24:54.981
Like there was a mini ice age that happened not that long ago where the sun

1419
01:24:56.370 --> 01:24:58.220
theoretically just,
I dunno,

1420
01:24:58.230 --> 01:25:03.230
it stopped being so active and then 1719 1790 yeah.

1421
01:25:03.900 --> 01:25:05.250
Yeah.
And that,

1422
01:25:05.251 --> 01:25:10.251
so this is like a reality that nobody seems to really like think about.

1423
01:25:11.281 --> 01:25:14.190
I mean that to me is the funniest thing when everyone's fighting each other,

1424
01:25:14.191 --> 01:25:18.450
we're all like furious at whoever the fuck is.
Like.

1425
01:25:18.451 --> 01:25:22.380
Nobody wants to accept like mountains fall out of the sky,

1426
01:25:22.650 --> 01:25:27.650
the sun from time to time burps fire so bright that it causes fires to break out

1427
01:25:29.011 --> 01:25:32.940
on the planet.
And then all the other shit we don't know about.
You know,

1428
01:25:32.941 --> 01:25:36.210
just the stuff we don't know about like that.
If we could talk then

1429
01:25:37.710 --> 01:25:38.540
yeah.

1430
01:25:38.540 --> 01:25:43.460
<v 3>1,200 foot asteroid could crash into earth because NASA missed these small</v>

1431
01:25:43.461 --> 01:25:47.210
details.
Oh Geez.
Less than a week old story.
Jesus Christ.

1432
01:25:47.211 --> 01:25:50.530
I don't need to see this NASA fucked up.
Yeah.

1433
01:25:50.570 --> 01:25:55.220
Well they haven't been getting any money,
Jamie.
You think that's why?
Yes.

1434
01:25:55.280 --> 01:25:57.500
Trump is diverted all the funds to the space force.

1435
01:25:57.580 --> 01:26:01.730
<v 2>No.
The truth is they,
yeah.</v>

1436
01:26:02.420 --> 01:26:05.750
Yeah.
I mean,
would they even tell us?
I mean that's,
no,

1437
01:26:06.130 --> 01:26:10.450
<v 3>no.
You don't think no let it hit you don't think they'd be like,
no,</v>

1438
01:26:10.451 --> 01:26:12.610
where are you going to do?
They wouldn't warn us going to hit.
It's going to hit.

1439
01:26:12.910 --> 01:26:14.200
You know,
Neil degrasse Tyson says,

1440
01:26:14.201 --> 01:26:19.120
we're like decades away from being able to divert it decades.
Decades.

1441
01:26:19.900 --> 01:26:23.950
Yeah.
Yeah.
If something's coming our way,
some civilization ender,

1442
01:26:23.980 --> 01:26:27.490
we're fucked and he,
this is not conspiracy theory folks.

1443
01:26:27.550 --> 01:26:29.200
There was an article today that a,

1444
01:26:29.201 --> 01:26:32.110
I put it on my Twitter that I read about hyenas.

1445
01:26:32.440 --> 01:26:36.370
They used to have hyenas in Canada up until the last ice age.

1446
01:26:36.910 --> 01:26:39.850
There's hyenas in fucking Canada.
Dude.

1447
01:26:40.480 --> 01:26:42.970
Like this whole thing changes all the time.
At the time,

1448
01:26:43.030 --> 01:26:46.930
there was a mile high sheet of ice up there.
Two miles high in some places.

1449
01:26:46.931 --> 01:26:48.820
That's right.
I was just in Chicago,
man.

1450
01:26:49.030 --> 01:26:52.360
And you look out at the Lake Lake Michigan.
Yeah.
She's amazing.

1451
01:26:52.660 --> 01:26:56.740
You look at it from Chicago.
Whoa,
Whoa,
whoa.
That was a fucking glacier.

1452
01:26:57.550 --> 01:27:00.350
That was a,
there was an ice.
She didn't have a melted.
Yeah,

1453
01:27:00.790 --> 01:27:05.290
that's how it got there.
That's the room,
the remanence of the melted ice sheets.

1454
01:27:06.010 --> 01:27:08.380
The whole fucking thing was under ice.
Yeah.

1455
01:27:08.960 --> 01:27:13.960
There's a place in Wisconsin where my friend Doug has a farm Cazenovia
Wisconsin.

1456
01:27:14.110 --> 01:27:17.680
That's a part of what they call the driftless area and the driftless area is the

1457
01:27:17.681 --> 01:27:19.540
places where the,
the,

1458
01:27:20.080 --> 01:27:25.080
these glaciers didn't come down and crush flat everything in front of them.

1459
01:27:25.750 --> 01:27:29.710
That's why you go to the Midwest.
It's fucking flat.
Yeah.

1460
01:27:29.711 --> 01:27:34.030
Flat as this table.
Why is that?
Because the fucking glaciers came down.

1461
01:27:34.031 --> 01:27:38.320
Just smush that mother fucker.
Just,
that's how it came down.

1462
01:27:38.470 --> 01:27:43.470
Like this giant mile high wall of ice just destroys everything in front of her

1463
01:27:45.550 --> 01:27:47.770
as it rolls across the landscape.

1464
01:27:48.100 --> 01:27:51.970
But it didn't hit this one area of Wisconsin and it's a,

1465
01:27:52.000 --> 01:27:55.270
or it didn't hit it as hard because you've got all these beautiful hills and

1466
01:27:55.271 --> 01:27:56.410
valleys.
That's pretty dope.

1467
01:27:56.460 --> 01:27:58.170
<v 2>Whoa,
that's beautiful.</v>

1468
01:27:58.240 --> 01:28:01.460
<v 3>Oh Holy Shit.
Isn't that crazy man?</v>

1469
01:28:01.461 --> 01:28:05.750
Crazy that that happened 12,000 years ago.
Right?
So this is,

1470
01:28:05.780 --> 01:28:09.080
we're not talking about something that's a long time ago and then boom,

1471
01:28:09.081 --> 01:28:13.370
that shit melts and becomes an an interior freshwater ocean.

1472
01:28:13.880 --> 01:28:15.120
Ms. Essentially what it is,

1473
01:28:15.240 --> 01:28:15.870
<v 2>dude,</v>

1474
01:28:15.870 --> 01:28:20.870
it's like our entire civilization is living the way like a middle aged

1475
01:28:21.630 --> 01:28:22.530
alcoholic.

1476
01:28:23.010 --> 01:28:27.700
He's starting to realize all the trouble they caused leaves but still debt going

1477
01:28:27.710 --> 01:28:29.070
to keep drinking.
Kind of like,

1478
01:28:29.250 --> 01:28:34.080
it's like if you look at like our whole species as one thing,

1479
01:28:34.440 --> 01:28:38.550
it's like right now we're dealing with like the same thing maybe smokers deal

1480
01:28:38.551 --> 01:28:39.960
with after a lifetime of smoking.

1481
01:28:40.140 --> 01:28:43.840
Like suddenly health effects are starting to happen,
right?
We've had like a,

1482
01:28:44.170 --> 01:28:45.600
a a nice run,

1483
01:28:45.870 --> 01:28:50.190
but now we're starting to get a little bit of payback for all the decisions past

1484
01:28:50.191 --> 01:28:54.900
generations have made.
We've got fucking radiation pouring into the ocean.

1485
01:28:55.140 --> 01:28:58.290
The ice caps are fucking melting.
And then on top of that,

1486
01:28:58.860 --> 01:29:03.860
the majority of us can't just can't deal that we either say fake news or we say,

1487
01:29:04.170 --> 01:29:07.220
uh,
now that are going to be dead anyway.
Bad.
Yeah.
Yet that,

1488
01:29:07.260 --> 01:29:08.220
those are the two things.

1489
01:29:08.400 --> 01:29:13.400
Because the reality to me like this fucking amazing thing about being a human is

1490
01:29:13.411 --> 01:29:18.411
that we are like a technological hive that has built itself around a planet

1491
01:29:19.171 --> 01:29:21.570
using the materials of the planet to make technology.

1492
01:29:21.960 --> 01:29:25.410
And we're still at the point of hive life where we're pretending there's

1493
01:29:25.411 --> 01:29:29.640
different bees when we're all the same fucking be,
you know,

1494
01:29:29.641 --> 01:29:34.080
it's just some of some of us are running weird operating systems and we can't

1495
01:29:34.081 --> 01:29:35.520
accept the fact that it's like,
listen,

1496
01:29:35.940 --> 01:29:40.940
we're a fucking hive of super advanced primates that are all living together in

1497
01:29:41.881 --> 01:29:45.210
a hive because that's the overview effect,
man.

1498
01:29:45.211 --> 01:29:47.940
We're astronauts talk about flying over and looking down.

1499
01:29:47.941 --> 01:29:48.990
It's like it's all the same.

1500
01:29:49.470 --> 01:29:53.610
The cities are mostly all the same and all the structures all look pretty much

1501
01:29:53.611 --> 01:29:57.480
the same.
Of course it's a fucking hive as schizophrenia.

1502
01:29:57.480 --> 01:30:00.870
Hive where pieces of the hive or like,
yeah,

1503
01:30:00.871 --> 01:30:02.760
over there we got a bomb.

1504
01:30:02.761 --> 01:30:05.760
That part of the hive because that part of the hive is different than us.

1505
01:30:05.761 --> 01:30:10.590
So that part of the hive wants to hurt us,
you know,
it pheromones being released,

1506
01:30:10.710 --> 01:30:15.090
you know,
not by queen bees but by influencers.
You know,

1507
01:30:15.091 --> 01:30:16.440
like the news,

1508
01:30:16.441 --> 01:30:21.000
the media blasting out this data pheromone that gets us ready for the wars,

1509
01:30:21.001 --> 01:30:25.260
gets us ready for the violence,
tries to justify,
rationalize it.

1510
01:30:25.470 --> 01:30:30.210
And then there's other weird new like little mini queen bees popping up,

1511
01:30:30.360 --> 01:30:34.170
releasing weird Fairmont's the influencers,
you know,
they're like,

1512
01:30:34.560 --> 01:30:38.460
some of them are making people dress a certain way,
fashion or whatever.

1513
01:30:38.670 --> 01:30:40.860
Some of them are making people freak out.

1514
01:30:41.040 --> 01:30:42.900
Some of them are making people more calm,

1515
01:30:43.110 --> 01:30:46.350
but we're dealing with the fact that we're all starting to wake up,
right?

1516
01:30:46.351 --> 01:30:50.490
We're all going to have to wake up to the fact that we're all the same thing

1517
01:30:50.760 --> 01:30:52.490
living in a,
uh,
in a hive.

1518
01:30:52.780 --> 01:30:57.690
And that if we don't come to that epiphany,
an individual,

1519
01:30:58.020 --> 01:31:02.790
I mean we're probably fucked.
Like we figured out a split the atom and we've got,

1520
01:31:03.120 --> 01:31:07.740
uh,
the,
the technology as it's coming in,
it's making the ability,

1521
01:31:07.970 --> 01:31:12.180
it's like,
I'm sorry,
please go ahead.
And collectively we kind of know,

1522
01:31:13.380 --> 01:31:13.880
but

1523
01:31:13.880 --> 01:31:17.450
<v 1>it's very difficult for everybody to act.
Yeah.
Right.</v>

1524
01:31:17.510 --> 01:31:20.660
Collectively we kind of know that we can't do things the way we're doing,

1525
01:31:20.661 --> 01:31:22.370
but they're going to do it.
What are we going to do?
Well,

1526
01:31:22.380 --> 01:31:25.430
he's going to drive that truck with the smoke coming out of the bat.

1527
01:31:25.490 --> 01:31:28.760
We'll fuck it.
I don't want to fix though.
What am I going to do about this?

1528
01:31:29.000 --> 01:31:32.840
What do I do?
What do we do?
Who's in charge?
Who's in charge and what do we do?

1529
01:31:33.450 --> 01:31:38.190
<v 2>You're asking me.
No.
Anybody.
Nobody.
Nobody has the answer to that.
Yeah.</v>

1530
01:31:38.220 --> 01:31:41.230
I think you gotta like get pragmatic.
I mean,
I,

1531
01:31:42.030 --> 01:31:43.770
there's that thing John Paul Sarte said,

1532
01:31:43.771 --> 01:31:45.880
and I'm not throwing bullets thought once said,

1533
01:31:46.180 --> 01:31:50.130
but it has stuck with me ever since I heard it.
Which is whatever you do,

1534
01:31:50.131 --> 01:31:53.580
you give the planet permission to do,
you give everyone permission to do so.

1535
01:31:54.450 --> 01:31:55.020
To me,

1536
01:31:55.020 --> 01:31:59.980
what's helped me like live a little less in a,

1537
01:32:00.190 --> 01:32:02.590
in a crazy like asshole way.
I mean,

1538
01:32:02.591 --> 01:32:06.940
aside from him having a baby is a realizing that,
oh,

1539
01:32:06.941 --> 01:32:10.450
if I can't stop,
you know,

1540
01:32:10.900 --> 01:32:14.260
using as much plastic as I do,
the world's fucked.

1541
01:32:14.590 --> 01:32:19.590
If I can't stop any kind of activity that I look into the world and think,

1542
01:32:20.411 --> 01:32:24.780
man,
why are people doing that?
Then the world is fucked because if you,

1543
01:32:24.950 --> 01:32:28.720
you know that fuck,
I'm sorry man.
Can I ran about as quick story,
do you mind?

1544
01:32:28.721 --> 01:32:31.780
I'm sorry.
You know that Gandhi story?
Which one?
Which one?

1545
01:32:32.350 --> 01:32:35.350
The one about like this and then this,
who knows?
Could be fake news.

1546
01:32:35.351 --> 01:32:36.760
I don't care as a parable,
it's cool.

1547
01:32:36.761 --> 01:32:41.761
But this woman brings her a kid to Gandhi and says,

1548
01:32:41.831 --> 01:32:46.690
I can't get him to stop eating sugar.
And Gandhi says,

1549
01:32:46.691 --> 01:32:50.440
come back in a month.
And uh,
she's like,
all right,

1550
01:32:51.120 --> 01:32:54.430
comes back in a month.
And God,
he looks at the kid and goes,
stop eating sugar.

1551
01:32:55.180 --> 01:32:58.480
And she's like,
why did you wait a month for this?
And Gandhi's like,

1552
01:32:58.510 --> 01:33:03.510
well I wanted to see if I could stop eating sugar first and you know,

1553
01:33:03.731 --> 01:33:08.470
before,
I'm like,
yeah.
Yeah.
So it's like,
to me the,

1554
01:33:09.280 --> 01:33:10.480
yeah,
it's cool,
right?

1555
01:33:10.481 --> 01:33:14.590
There's a listlessness in the world because everyone wants to be heroic.

1556
01:33:15.250 --> 01:33:20.170
But people are wanting to act on the global stage while neglecting the,

1557
01:33:20.171 --> 01:33:22.840
their,
their home,
their family themselves.

1558
01:33:23.320 --> 01:33:26.440
And it's frustrating because you,
why wouldn't you think that?

1559
01:33:26.441 --> 01:33:31.000
Cause it seems like we're being,
like,
you're seeing the big,
big scale of things,

1560
01:33:31.001 --> 01:33:35.620
but it's like personally,
when I fucking finally it clicked,

1561
01:33:35.621 --> 01:33:37.690
man,
I can't change anybody else.

1562
01:33:37.691 --> 01:33:41.380
Like I'm not going to make anyone do anything.

1563
01:33:41.860 --> 01:33:43.480
I'm not gonna make anyone meditate.

1564
01:33:43.481 --> 01:33:46.720
I'm not going to make anyone do this or that or do anything because everyone's

1565
01:33:46.721 --> 01:33:50.710
doing their own trip anyway.
Man.
Who the fuck am I to say what our life?

1566
01:33:50.920 --> 01:33:52.300
But that's part of the problem,
right?

1567
01:33:52.301 --> 01:33:55.740
It's the people trying to get people to behave a certain way.
That's we're,

1568
01:33:55.741 --> 01:34:00.310
we're experienced a lot of that right now.
Yes.
Yes man.

1569
01:34:00.311 --> 01:34:03.730
And it's like,
the thing is that's the impulse is noble,

1570
01:34:04.120 --> 01:34:05.890
but it's unfortunately,

1571
01:34:05.891 --> 01:34:09.520
it's like trying to build a fucking second storey house when you haven't built

1572
01:34:09.521 --> 01:34:10.510
the first story,

1573
01:34:10.930 --> 01:34:15.930
which is like you need to like get your own house in order and then maybe

1574
01:34:17.291 --> 01:34:21.970
there's some teaching,
but usually by the time that happens,
you don't,
you're not,

1575
01:34:22.030 --> 01:34:23.620
you're on a talker,
you know.

1576
01:34:23.621 --> 01:34:28.621
And so to me that has been like a real exciting thing to realize.

1577
01:34:29.920 --> 01:34:34.570
This Jack Kornfield says this,
I'm sorry if I've said this before,

1578
01:34:34.870 --> 01:34:39.640
tend to the part of the garden you can touch and um,
that's it.
So it's like,

1579
01:34:40.720 --> 01:34:42.550
to me it's just a big relief.
Number one,

1580
01:34:42.551 --> 01:34:46.390
you can't do shit for anybody else but yourself.
Number two,

1581
01:34:46.810 --> 01:34:49.150
you don't need no one.
None of us know.

1582
01:34:49.840 --> 01:34:53.710
We don't have to impose some moral thing on you.

1583
01:34:54.010 --> 01:34:58.230
But there is it one actionable thing and action anyone

1584
01:34:58.230 --> 01:35:03.150
<v 6>can take which is amoral,
which is find out who you are.</v>

1585
01:35:03.780 --> 01:35:08.220
That's it.
Find out who you are,
who are you really,
what are you,

1586
01:35:08.280 --> 01:35:11.940
explore that shit.
Right and then see how you start changing.

1587
01:35:12.300 --> 01:35:17.300
I think that's a real pragmatic solution to all this stuff and it actionable to,

1588
01:35:18.091 --> 01:35:21.930
and it's like you want to find out who you are by,
you know,

1589
01:35:21.931 --> 01:35:25.680
rubbing Manet's all of your Dick and letting your dog like get off of you think

1590
01:35:25.681 --> 01:35:29.880
that's a true exploration.
Go ahead work for me.
I'm enlightened now.

1591
01:35:29.910 --> 01:35:33.270
That's the way,
I'm just kidding.
Speaking of Ozone,
oh Jay's on Twitter.

1592
01:35:33.510 --> 01:35:36.150
I saw that shit.
Do you see the one guy who

1593
01:35:36.150 --> 01:35:40.020
<v 1>made a parody video of his welcome Twitter world?</v>

1594
01:35:40.560 --> 01:35:43.410
He made this weird dad video.

1595
01:35:43.470 --> 01:35:48.240
It's so strangely,
what's the word?
Apocalyptic.

1596
01:35:48.300 --> 01:35:53.040
No disingenuous.
Strangely disingenuous.
I thought it was like,

1597
01:35:53.060 --> 01:35:58.020
he's like,
he's acting again but he hasn't acted in forever.

1598
01:35:58.230 --> 01:36:03.230
And also maybe he's suffering a little bit from the football injuries cause

1599
01:36:04.951 --> 01:36:06.390
there's a struggle.
I'm,

1600
01:36:06.391 --> 01:36:11.391
I am very sensitive to people that have been hit in the head a lot of times

1601
01:36:13.011 --> 01:36:15.720
struggling to talk cause I look for it.

1602
01:36:17.080 --> 01:36:18.480
I see it in people that don't want to see it.

1603
01:36:18.490 --> 01:36:20.430
And it's scary and we all talk about it.

1604
01:36:20.510 --> 01:36:25.030
Like people that work for the UFC fighters,
trainers,

1605
01:36:25.280 --> 01:36:27.670
it's people who do kickboxing.
We all,

1606
01:36:27.700 --> 01:36:32.370
everyone talks about seeing certain folks starting to slip and some folks will

1607
01:36:32.371 --> 01:36:35.370
start to talk about it,
about themselves.
You know,
they're having a problem.

1608
01:36:35.510 --> 01:36:39.810
That's what I got.
I was listening to that.
So like a little Twitter world.

1609
01:36:39.910 --> 01:36:43.680
All right.
I didn't take that Oj Simpson.
Yeah.
I'm going to go.

1610
01:36:43.980 --> 01:36:47.810
I can dispel some of the bs the people have been saying about,
um,

1611
01:36:47.880 --> 01:36:50.580
about me with no accountability.
Yeah.

1612
01:36:50.790 --> 01:36:54.030
Plus I'm going to talk about sports and politics.

1613
01:36:54.270 --> 01:36:57.690
It's like this weird acting job that he did.

1614
01:36:57.980 --> 01:37:01.880
<v 6>It's creepy,
man.
Whoa.
It was weird.
All that.
Yeah.</v>

1615
01:37:01.890 --> 01:37:05.570
So it was a weird moment,
man.
I,
that's a cool,
that,
that,

1616
01:37:05.600 --> 01:37:10.600
that thing that happens to people who've like done shitty things where instead

1617
01:37:13.401 --> 01:37:17.480
of just saying like,
yeah,
I fucked up.
Oh,
I have a chance say that.
You can't say,

1618
01:37:17.481 --> 01:37:20.480
yeah,
I killed somebody.
Right.
Well you can.

1619
01:37:20.960 --> 01:37:24.770
But if you do that,
you're going to suddenly,
and there'll be,

1620
01:37:24.800 --> 01:37:28.820
I think for anybody who's done,
she thinks the moment you just say it,

1621
01:37:29.240 --> 01:37:32.360
you get to be standing again on the real ground,

1622
01:37:32.390 --> 01:37:37.280
like the real terrain instead of like the bullshit world he'd been living in.

1623
01:37:37.281 --> 01:37:41.450
But when you decide not to do that,
then you do have this like,

1624
01:37:41.451 --> 01:37:42.950
well it's like the uncanny valley.

1625
01:37:43.130 --> 01:37:47.900
Like you have this like android quality to you because you're not reflecting

1626
01:37:47.901 --> 01:37:48.531
reality.

1627
01:37:48.531 --> 01:37:53.000
You're reflecting reality after you put lipstick on it and sunglasses and combed

1628
01:37:53.001 --> 01:37:57.420
his hair,
put some perfume on out of a nose job,
got its ass,

1629
01:37:57.690 --> 01:38:01.920
got asked him plants and that's your fucking realities is super plastic.

1630
01:38:02.130 --> 01:38:04.350
Like someone who's been getting plastic surgery for years.

1631
01:38:04.351 --> 01:38:08.730
And so you're pretending that that's your existence.
You see it man,

1632
01:38:08.731 --> 01:38:13.731
when like people are getting sentenced for killing people and they're like the,

1633
01:38:13.960 --> 01:38:15.630
the look on their fucking faces,

1634
01:38:15.631 --> 01:38:20.631
like so confused because they have created this valley in between that person,

1635
01:38:23.491 --> 01:38:28.110
the person they are.
And,
and you know,
it's,
they've split in half essentially,

1636
01:38:28.380 --> 01:38:30.990
and they can't deal with,
that's why so many people have murdered.

1637
01:38:30.991 --> 01:38:35.640
People will say,
I wasn't there.
I don't remember.
It was a dream.

1638
01:38:36.120 --> 01:38:38.100
I didn't know I didn't do it.

1639
01:38:38.640 --> 01:38:41.760
And Gacy I should be a,

1640
01:38:41.761 --> 01:38:44.640
I should be sentenced for running a funeral home without a license.

1641
01:38:45.150 --> 01:38:46.530
He was saying when he was out of town,

1642
01:38:46.531 --> 01:38:51.420
people were bearing kid dead kid bodies under his fucking house.
You know,

1643
01:38:51.421 --> 01:38:55.890
Eddie minute you met him.
He tripped himself enough.
Really?
Absolutely.

1644
01:38:56.160 --> 01:39:00.690
Because otherwise you have to deal with the fact that you are a murderer,

1645
01:39:00.710 --> 01:39:03.150
that you killed fucking,

1646
01:39:03.151 --> 01:39:07.500
you strangled fucking kids that you dress like a fucking clown,

1647
01:39:07.860 --> 01:39:10.080
you know,
and,
and like killed kids.

1648
01:39:10.440 --> 01:39:15.440
Like it's so unpalatable to deal with that shit because you're just a crazy

1649
01:39:15.871 --> 01:39:19.440
lunatic who is out of control.
So you'd rather make up a story.

1650
01:39:19.740 --> 01:39:23.850
Usually it's conspiratorial.
Somebody was like,
somebody was like,
hey man,

1651
01:39:23.851 --> 01:39:27.750
you know where you can bury those kid bodies.
I think gacys out of town.

1652
01:39:27.840 --> 01:39:32.070
Jesus Christ.
Yeah,
man,
isn't that fucking crazy?
It's fucking crazy.
Yeah.

1653
01:39:33.080 --> 01:39:37.700
<v 1>Jesus Christ.
I know.
And that's the thing people voice said about Ojai,</v>

1654
01:39:37.890 --> 01:39:40.130
that it's almost like he doesn't even believe he did it now.

1655
01:39:40.370 --> 01:39:44.960
But the problem with that is there was a fucking Emoji that he tweeted at this

1656
01:39:44.961 --> 01:39:46.040
guy,
you know,

1657
01:39:46.430 --> 01:39:51.430
he had a direct message with this guy and he had like 16 knives and he said he's

1658
01:39:51.501 --> 01:39:55.640
going to cut them.
Like if that's true,
if he really did send that,

1659
01:39:55.641 --> 01:39:58.040
if it's not Photoshop,
that's not bullshit.

1660
01:39:58.250 --> 01:40:03.020
You imagine getting a DM from Oj cause you made a parody video.
She's God.

1661
01:40:03.050 --> 01:40:03.770
Cause like while,

1662
01:40:03.770 --> 01:40:08.770
I can't guess what he did was he put ogs video where he was talking and in the

1663
01:40:08.871 --> 01:40:12.680
background he had someone screaming,
help call the police,
help,
help.

1664
01:40:14.120 --> 01:40:17.480
And so then Oj sends him his direct message,
allegedly,

1665
01:40:17.690 --> 01:40:20.240
who knows what really happened.
Who knows.
But if it did,

1666
01:40:21.520 --> 01:40:25.150
<v 6>dude,
I would fucking,
I would like find a cave somewhere.</v>

1667
01:40:25.151 --> 01:40:28.000
I'd want to move to the Hamartia is I can't,
I couldn't deal with it man.

1668
01:40:28.150 --> 01:40:30.550
Hello Twitter world.
I'm just,
you know,

1669
01:40:30.551 --> 01:40:33.630
cause he could get you like you could get you if you want it to.
I bet.

1670
01:40:34.040 --> 01:40:36.500
<v 1>Yeah.
I mean most times you have left.
He's 71 years old</v>

1671
01:40:36.550 --> 01:40:40.060
<v 6>after he DMZ disappears.
You know,
people like we don't know where he is.</v>

1672
01:40:40.440 --> 01:40:45.330
<v 1>Norm Mcdonald tweeted at them.
It's hilarious.
Norm said,
hey juice.
Um,</v>

1673
01:40:45.750 --> 01:40:48.060
I just wanted to tell you that through that video.

1674
01:40:48.061 --> 01:40:51.060
I know the golf course that's behind you so I could figure out where your house

1675
01:40:51.061 --> 01:40:55.600
is and I wouldn't do that.
But somebody else might.
Hmm.
Yeah.
That was hilarious.

1676
01:40:56.080 --> 01:40:58.420
Nor Mcdonald's.
So funny.
These are the best.

1677
01:40:58.570 --> 01:41:01.150
I'm trying to get him to do a podcast.
I was trying to get him an Adam.

1678
01:41:01.151 --> 01:41:02.290
You get to do a podcast.

1679
01:41:02.620 --> 01:41:06.330
I don't know what he can do though while he's got this Netflix deal and these

1680
01:41:06.360 --> 01:41:11.350
shows is,
I don't know where it's at.
I don't know if he has a contract,

1681
01:41:12.310 --> 01:41:15.320
but he should do a podcast.
It's so goddamn national.
Travis.

1682
01:41:15.321 --> 01:41:18.790
See did he doesn't have a podcast.
He's so fucking funny.

1683
01:41:19.190 --> 01:41:23.390
<v 6>Well isn't his show.
Kai is kind of like a podcast,
like it has that,</v>

1684
01:41:23.410 --> 01:41:24.960
but he hasn't been doing it.
Oh.

1685
01:41:25.100 --> 01:41:27.110
<v 1>And they don't want him doing interviews and stuff.</v>

1686
01:41:27.140 --> 01:41:29.870
It's like it's a little tricky cause he said some crazy shit.

1687
01:41:29.871 --> 01:41:34.630
You know norm says crazy shit and he said some crazy shit like,
like if you,

1688
01:41:34.720 --> 01:41:37.790
it's about someone saying something that will you believe that you'd have to be,

1689
01:41:37.820 --> 01:41:39.580
you'd have to have down syndrome.
Huh?

1690
01:41:39.920 --> 01:41:42.620
Like he thought that would be better than say you'd have to be retarded

1691
01:41:45.350 --> 01:41:48.890
and they put like what the fuck?
Dammit.
That'd people got real mad at him.

1692
01:41:48.891 --> 01:41:53.090
I think it was on the stern show.
He's just,
he's just a treasure.

1693
01:41:53.370 --> 01:41:57.800
<v 6>Okay.
Joe,
I'm sorry to like I want,
I like,</v>

1694
01:41:57.810 --> 01:41:59.930
I thought I had all these questions for you man.

1695
01:41:59.940 --> 01:42:02.750
I was like guess lame to ask my questions on their show and it's not in the

1696
01:42:02.751 --> 01:42:05.570
moment like we often do,
but I really do.

1697
01:42:05.660 --> 01:42:07.040
I know you've probably been talking about it,

1698
01:42:07.041 --> 01:42:12.041
but I wanted to hear your take on deep fake cause like that fucking deep faker.

1699
01:42:13.010 --> 01:42:15.770
You really bothered me.

1700
01:42:15.771 --> 01:42:20.771
Like it set off like a whole series of thoughts in my head that like of all the

1701
01:42:21.531 --> 01:42:25.130
futuristic shit that freaks me out from us.

1702
01:42:25.820 --> 01:42:27.230
<v 1>Well for someone like you or someone like me,</v>

1703
01:42:27.231 --> 01:42:30.380
it's easy for them to do it because they basically got a library of all the

1704
01:42:30.381 --> 01:42:32.390
sounds that we can make with our mouth.

1705
01:42:32.840 --> 01:42:35.870
And so they put it in a database and then they can get you to say words you've

1706
01:42:35.871 --> 01:42:39.290
never said before and in order that you've never said them before in a way that

1707
01:42:39.291 --> 01:42:42.980
you can kind of distinguish.
For now,

1708
01:42:43.310 --> 01:42:44.600
I kind of can hear that it's fake,

1709
01:42:44.601 --> 01:42:49.540
but it was me talking about sponsoring a hockey team fills all chimpanzees.
Yeah.

1710
01:42:49.670 --> 01:42:53.180
And teaching chimps to play hockey,
we sounds exactly like something I would do.

1711
01:42:53.720 --> 01:42:57.740
And um,
it's,
it's close.
You know,
I mean,

1712
01:42:57.741 --> 01:43:02.360
they had one a few years ago that they did with Ronald Reagan where they had a

1713
01:43:02.361 --> 01:43:07.280
fake speech and this was way,
way before the Internet.

1714
01:43:07.940 --> 01:43:12.940
And someone had pieced together a fake collaboration of a bunch of different

1715
01:43:15.321 --> 01:43:20.321
Ronald Reagan's speeches and then use them with sound editing and turned it into

1716
01:43:20.720 --> 01:43:23.180
a whole statement that he never gave before.

1717
01:43:23.510 --> 01:43:28.100
And then the White House went on television and showed how they did it and

1718
01:43:28.101 --> 01:43:32.540
showed on the news all the different speeches that they pulled from.

1719
01:43:32.541 --> 01:43:35.900
And this,
the actual sentence is where they pulled from.
They showed it to you.

1720
01:43:36.200 --> 01:43:39.440
So there could be no denying someone,
I forget what it was.

1721
01:43:39.800 --> 01:43:42.070
Maybe it was the Russians.
Was it the Russians?
Yeah,

1722
01:43:42.140 --> 01:43:46.550
of course someone had done that but I don't know.
I don't know who did it.

1723
01:43:47.570 --> 01:43:51.470
I don't remember.
But it was interesting cause I was like,
Oh wow,

1724
01:43:51.471 --> 01:43:53.120
they can do that.
But I thought,
you know,

1725
01:43:53.121 --> 01:43:56.840
think about how many times Ronald Reagan has given speeches.
You just take,

1726
01:43:57.200 --> 01:43:59.720
listen someone with painstaking detail,

1727
01:43:59.870 --> 01:44:01.820
mark down all the words in those speeches,

1728
01:44:01.821 --> 01:44:05.120
put them all in some sort of a multi loop cause it's,
you know,

1729
01:44:05.130 --> 01:44:09.770
you'd have to go like to Phil Spector's house and they have the old school real

1730
01:44:09.771 --> 01:44:10.421
to real.

1731
01:44:10.421 --> 01:44:14.930
Should sound recorders piece that shit together and splice it up and then

1732
01:44:14.931 --> 01:44:15.764
release it.

1733
01:44:16.490 --> 01:44:19.370
Pretend that Ronald Reagan is trying to start a war with Iran or something like

1734
01:44:19.371 --> 01:44:21.800
that.
I forget what it was.
Do you remember the premise?

1735
01:44:22.100 --> 01:44:26.360
<v 6>No,
I don't remember the premise of that,
but I remember that the recording,</v>

1736
01:44:26.680 --> 01:44:31.490
I don't know.
I kind of remember it,
but it's a foggy memory man.

1737
01:44:31.491 --> 01:44:35.990
It's pretty wild.
But this is like
to me,

1738
01:44:36.380 --> 01:44:39.230
fuck the sun and all the things to worry about.

1739
01:44:39.260 --> 01:44:43.520
This shit is really intense man.
Like you know about the hostage,

1740
01:44:44.360 --> 01:44:45.980
the fucking weird hostage.

1741
01:44:46.490 --> 01:44:50.060
I found thing people are doing where they're like you get a phone call from the

1742
01:44:50.061 --> 01:44:54.800
phone number of your wife and you answer it and it's like we've kidnapped your

1743
01:44:54.801 --> 01:44:58.190
wife.
You don't someone freaking out in the background.

1744
01:44:58.490 --> 01:45:00.860
They're like send us money or she's fucked.

1745
01:45:01.250 --> 01:45:06.080
And like they've been right now they've been doing is they've been,
you know,

1746
01:45:06.081 --> 01:45:09.550
someone will say let me talk to her and they just hand it to some lady.
Yeah.

1747
01:45:09.630 --> 01:45:11.860
<v 8>He's like,
you</v>

1748
01:45:11.870 --> 01:45:13.860
<v 6>think,
oh my God,
it's her.
I'll give you whatever you want.</v>

1749
01:45:14.220 --> 01:45:16.080
People have been sending them money,
you know.

1750
01:45:16.380 --> 01:45:20.700
And like when you consider like what happens when deep fake technology

1751
01:45:20.701 --> 01:45:25.500
intersects with just the ability to like call people from spoofed numbers and it

1752
01:45:25.501 --> 01:45:28.680
suddenly if someone gets your phone number list,

1753
01:45:29.070 --> 01:45:33.990
they're going to be able to call your friends is you and record conversations

1754
01:45:34.140 --> 01:45:38.340
where it is.
They sort of dredge up,
you know,
who knows whatever they want.

1755
01:45:38.580 --> 01:45:40.890
Maybe they want to blackmail you,
maybe they want to get money,

1756
01:45:40.891 --> 01:45:42.240
maybe they want to embarrass you.

1757
01:45:42.630 --> 01:45:47.630
That to me is like so spectacularly fucking weird that we're going to end up

1758
01:45:49.231 --> 01:45:53.790
having to have passwords that we tell each other away from our Alexis,

1759
01:45:53.970 --> 01:45:57.270
which is like,
listen,
if I call you and I'm seeming strange,

1760
01:45:58.320 --> 01:45:59.153
you know the,

1761
01:45:59.180 --> 01:46:03.540
the password is like go for 69 otherwise it's not me.

1762
01:46:03.810 --> 01:46:06.090
You know,
cause that's gonna that's a reality.

1763
01:46:06.091 --> 01:46:09.240
I mean just look what people are already fucking doing with spoofing numbers.

1764
01:46:10.050 --> 01:46:14.040
That's fucked up man.
And like that,
that aspect of it.

1765
01:46:14.041 --> 01:46:18.900
And also just like supply and demand.
In other words,
there's one Joe Rogan,
right,

1766
01:46:18.960 --> 01:46:19.793
right now.

1767
01:46:20.070 --> 01:46:24.570
But if an AI starts duplicating you and improving on you,
like,

1768
01:46:24.571 --> 01:46:26.940
and I'm saying,
you know,
five or 10 years,
no offense man,

1769
01:46:27.090 --> 01:46:31.260
but maybe an AI could like turn you twice as smart,
you know,

1770
01:46:31.261 --> 01:46:33.330
make you like whatever,
who knows what,

1771
01:46:33.331 --> 01:46:38.331
and then suddenly you're no longer in demand in the sense that once the Joe

1772
01:46:39.900 --> 01:46:44.710
Rogan AI package goes on the dark web or makes its way into wherever people are

1773
01:46:44.711 --> 01:46:48.780
going to just be able to download you and have conversations with you and make

1774
01:46:48.781 --> 01:46:51.400
video.
Don't know that to be is the the,

1775
01:46:51.440 --> 01:46:55.860
so what are the most bizarre realities that we are entering into is one where

1776
01:46:55.861 --> 01:46:59.040
you're going to go on youtube and there's going to be a video of you,

1777
01:46:59.670 --> 01:47:04.170
looks like you,
sounds like you,
but it's like 50 times funnier than you,

1778
01:47:04.440 --> 01:47:06.090
50 times cooler than you,

1779
01:47:06.091 --> 01:47:10.440
50 times smarter than you because it's an AI pulling from the Internet.

1780
01:47:10.470 --> 01:47:13.920
It's just you,
but better.
And no one's gonna want to watch you anymore.

1781
01:47:13.950 --> 01:47:16.540
Cause they're like,
I want to watch,
I love the railroad gun,

1782
01:47:16.740 --> 01:47:21.030
but I want to watch the Rogan who's brain is functioning 50 times the speed of a

1783
01:47:21.031 --> 01:47:25.220
normal human brain.
Because that guy,
wow,
that's either going to take over,

1784
01:47:25.440 --> 01:47:28.360
will rise all obsolete.
Were they?
Yeah.

1785
01:47:28.710 --> 01:47:31.570
<v 1>Of all of us.
They're going to be like invasion of the body snatchers.</v>

1786
01:47:31.940 --> 01:47:36.620
<v 6>Yeah,
that's right.
That's right man.
And that's not,
I mean I'm saying even if,</v>

1787
01:47:36.621 --> 01:47:40.190
let's say it's 20 years away,
that's still too fucking soon.

1788
01:47:40.191 --> 01:47:43.580
Hundred let's go crazy then.
Yeah.

1789
01:47:43.581 --> 01:47:48.470
We're going to be basically like sort of drowned out by multiple versions of

1790
01:47:48.471 --> 01:47:51.650
ourself with exponential intelligence.
Yeah.

1791
01:47:51.750 --> 01:47:54.810
<v 1>Well that was my concern when I was talking to Kurzweil about downloading your</v>

1792
01:47:54.811 --> 01:47:56.940
consciousness into a computer.
I'm like,

1793
01:47:56.941 --> 01:48:01.050
what's to stop you from making multiple copies if you can make one copy.
Yeah.

1794
01:48:01.230 --> 01:48:03.210
Like what's,
what's to stop you from being like,

1795
01:48:03.520 --> 01:48:08.460
tell me some fat guy with a little dick was a real asshole.

1796
01:48:08.850 --> 01:48:13.850
Wouldn't hack into the system and infest it with copies of him.

1797
01:48:14.550 --> 01:48:14.940
Yeah.

1798
01:48:14.940 --> 01:48:19.940
That just overwhelms everyone else's data where he is omnipotent and he is

1799
01:48:19.980 --> 01:48:24.000
literally the ruler of the realm that he exists in.
Yeah.

1800
01:48:24.630 --> 01:48:28.680
Yeah.
Cause he's figured out how to hack into the grid and take over.

1801
01:48:28.690 --> 01:48:30.840
Imagine you think you're going to be in heaven,

1802
01:48:30.990 --> 01:48:33.600
you're going to enter into this virtual reality,
but look,

1803
01:48:33.960 --> 01:48:34.890
you're going to get to what?

1804
01:48:34.891 --> 01:48:39.540
Fly Dragons and have sex with beautiful women and eat fruit and this fat guy

1805
01:48:39.541 --> 01:48:40.380
with a little Dick,

1806
01:48:40.710 --> 01:48:43.590
he acts the system and then everybody's going to suck his dick.

1807
01:48:43.590 --> 01:48:47.100
And everywhere you go is a version of him is trying to get you to suck his dick.

1808
01:48:47.490 --> 01:48:51.360
Come on.
It's fucking people's ears as he's holding people down five,

1809
01:48:51.361 --> 01:48:55.260
six of 'em on a person by just fucking you from every angle by,

1810
01:48:55.440 --> 01:48:59.790
that's what he created in this.
I mean that's what a computer virus is.
Sure.

1811
01:48:59.820 --> 01:49:02.780
Fucking everybody,
right?
If you think about that the most,

1812
01:49:02.790 --> 01:49:06.030
there's a lot of viruses.
I don't know what,
how,
what percentage of viruses,
Jamie,

1813
01:49:06.031 --> 01:49:09.960
you'd know this are not financially motivated.

1814
01:49:11.010 --> 01:49:13.970
There's gotta be some viruses that people create just a fuck.

1815
01:49:14.310 --> 01:49:18.210
<v 6>Sure.
Right in the old days for sure,
man.
I mean,
I think,
yeah,</v>

1816
01:49:18.240 --> 01:49:21.990
they were just there to fuck up your threes or computer fuck up you.

1817
01:49:22.200 --> 01:49:23.430
They didn't have,
they weren't worm.

1818
01:49:23.440 --> 01:49:27.120
They weren't grabbing data to use it against you.
They're just like,
you know,

1819
01:49:27.210 --> 01:49:29.430
shutting your computer down.
It'd be a dick.
Yeah.

1820
01:49:29.490 --> 01:49:32.610
Or making it say weird things like you know,
real basic.

1821
01:49:32.611 --> 01:49:35.990
The old viruses in the days of AOL,
remember those man there are cool.

1822
01:49:36.020 --> 01:49:37.530
They were like scary,

1823
01:49:37.531 --> 01:49:41.400
but not like today where they like shut down the power grid until you send

1824
01:49:41.401 --> 01:49:43.420
somebody $1 million worth of bitcoin.

1825
01:49:43.550 --> 01:49:48.190
<v 1>Oh,
you have to completely remap your hard drive.
Completely.</v>

1826
01:49:48.191 --> 01:49:52.780
Re Upload your operating system just kills every of the only way you got to kill

1827
01:49:52.781 --> 01:49:57.160
the operating systems.
Swipe it clean.
Start from scratch.
Sorry.

1828
01:49:57.400 --> 01:50:01.600
It's all cooked.
Yeah.
All your work.
Fuck off.
Gone.

1829
01:50:01.960 --> 01:50:05.970
Gone Man.
Just like this fat guy with a little Dick than everybody.

1830
01:50:06.460 --> 01:50:10.750
Hundreds of them.
A Sea of I'm running at you.
Pulling on their half our decks.

1831
01:50:10.900 --> 01:50:11.140
Yeah.

1832
01:50:11.140 --> 01:50:15.220
<v 6>Well,
the Ha,
there's a story got around this weekend about a Samsung.</v>

1833
01:50:15.221 --> 01:50:18.910
TV's having viruses and,
and then you being able to scan it for a virus.

1834
01:50:18.911 --> 01:50:22.150
There's like a program on it that allows you to scan for viruses.
And then Ted,

1835
01:50:22.160 --> 01:50:24.630
I guess today Samsung deleted that tweet.
Oh Great.

1836
01:50:24.640 --> 01:50:26.340
People are pointing back to this being an act.

1837
01:50:26.341 --> 01:50:30.130
The weeping angel program or the CIA could use your TV to listen to your

1838
01:50:30.131 --> 01:50:34.360
conversations.
And they are doing that and they're recording it.
Being Angel.

1839
01:50:34.540 --> 01:50:38.770
What a great name.
Why doesn't the CIA started dating the fucking navy?

1840
01:50:38.780 --> 01:50:43.780
UFO weeping angel.
Why do they call it that?
Why do they call?
What is that?

1841
01:50:43.781 --> 01:50:47.110
That's why.
Why do they have to bring angels?
Is that Satan?

1842
01:50:47.320 --> 01:50:50.950
Is Satan a weeping angel?
Is that what they're saying?
Like what the fuck is that?

1843
01:50:51.070 --> 01:50:55.720
And weeping angel.
That's weird,
man.
That's fucking weird.

1844
01:50:55.721 --> 01:50:56.950
But like,
you know,

1845
01:50:56.951 --> 01:51:01.630
the implication that they in your deep fake that they sent out to the world was

1846
01:51:01.631 --> 01:51:03.910
it already happened.
You know,
they're like,

1847
01:51:03.911 --> 01:51:05.620
how do you know this hasn't already happened?

1848
01:51:06.010 --> 01:51:08.500
In other words like how do we know we're not duplicates?

1849
01:51:08.501 --> 01:51:13.501
How do we know we're not one of an infinite number and array of like,

1850
01:51:14.170 --> 01:51:18.760
you know,
versions of ice that are being populated all over something.
Some

1851
01:51:18.760 --> 01:51:20.530
<v 1>server somewhere could be,</v>

1852
01:51:21.820 --> 01:51:25.150
well that's the thing about the simulation theories that one day we,

1853
01:51:25.510 --> 01:51:27.400
if things keep going the way they are,

1854
01:51:27.850 --> 01:51:31.690
like then I was going to bring this up when we were talking about people like

1855
01:51:31.691 --> 01:51:35.320
looking at cities and looking at the grids and looking at the high like what is,

1856
01:51:35.350 --> 01:51:38.290
what are these cities doing while they're spreading and the being productive.

1857
01:51:38.410 --> 01:51:41.430
They're making things and they make me better things all the time.
Well,

1858
01:51:41.440 --> 01:51:44.400
if they're making better things all the time,
like what are they interested in?

1859
01:51:44.401 --> 01:51:48.550
While they're interested in computers and CGI and artificial intelligence and

1860
01:51:48.551 --> 01:51:53.310
artificial life and,
and they're all definitely moving in some sort of a,

1861
01:51:53.311 --> 01:51:57.160
a greater technological dependency.

1862
01:51:57.370 --> 01:52:00.130
Like we're pretty dependent now,
but it's going to get greater and greater,
right?

1863
01:52:00.131 --> 01:52:02.860
Yeah.
We'll get more and more.
Whoa,

1864
01:52:03.970 --> 01:52:05.800
one t one day,

1865
01:52:06.100 --> 01:52:11.100
they're going to have a reality that isn't tangible in the sense that without

1866
01:52:14.681 --> 01:52:17.020
this system you wouldn't be able to experience it.

1867
01:52:17.500 --> 01:52:21.400
But it will be a reality once you're in the system.
Once you're in the system,

1868
01:52:21.401 --> 01:52:24.250
you will feel your elbows on the oak desk.
Yes.

1869
01:52:24.400 --> 01:52:28.030
You will feel the sweat on your palms,
you'll feel the sunglasses on your nose,

1870
01:52:28.031 --> 01:52:31.810
you'll feel all those things.
Yeah.
So who's to say that that's not real?
Well,

1871
01:52:31.820 --> 01:52:34.150
that can happen one day.

1872
01:52:34.330 --> 01:52:37.750
If they can create an artificial reality that you cannot discern from the

1873
01:52:37.751 --> 01:52:39.280
reality that you're currently experiencing,

1874
01:52:39.460 --> 01:52:42.820
how do you know it hasn't already happened?
Right?
You don't.
You don't.

1875
01:52:42.880 --> 01:52:43.511
And you know,

1876
01:52:43.511 --> 01:52:48.511
some super fucking people think that we should keep open the possibility that

1877
01:52:49.701 --> 01:52:54.701
that is what we're operating under her or that the stability and the rigidity of

1878
01:52:56.601 --> 01:53:01.601
the dimension that we exist in is not nearly as firm and not nearly as permanent

1879
01:53:02.510 --> 01:53:03.860
as we like to think it is.
Right.

1880
01:53:03.920 --> 01:53:08.090
Which is one of the reasons why psychedelics is so exciting.
And so,
uh,
there's,

1881
01:53:08.091 --> 01:53:10.040
there's so,
there's hope.

1882
01:53:10.670 --> 01:53:11.503
<v 9>Okay.</v>

1883
01:53:11.880 --> 01:53:15.930
<v 1>They're transformative,
but they're also,
they're valuable,
but they're also,</v>

1884
01:53:17.120 --> 01:53:17.530
<v 9>yeah,</v>

1885
01:53:17.530 --> 01:53:21.970
<v 1>they aluminate the possibility of others,
of other things,</v>

1886
01:53:21.971 --> 01:53:24.280
other dimensions,
other life forms,
other,

1887
01:53:24.760 --> 01:53:29.290
other levels of consciousness of other ways of interacting with each other.

1888
01:53:29.550 --> 01:53:32.770
Especially my mom.
I kind of,
all of them,
all of them.

1889
01:53:32.800 --> 01:53:37.800
That when you take the guy a transformative dose and you experienced some weird

1890
01:53:38.380 --> 01:53:40.600
thing where you're like,
oh,
this is possible to like,

1891
01:53:40.601 --> 01:53:44.680
this is like a whole nother way of existing.
Like who's to say that if,

1892
01:53:44.730 --> 01:53:46.870
if if human neuro chemistry,
right.

1893
01:53:46.900 --> 01:53:51.900
If that's what's causing depression and elation and dopamine and Serotonin and

1894
01:53:52.061 --> 01:53:55.360
all these different wonderful things,
it's caused Melatonin.

1895
01:53:55.390 --> 01:53:57.850
It's all these different things that happen when you're sleeping.

1896
01:53:58.060 --> 01:54:03.060
And then the psychedelic ones like the DMT W who's to say that we have to exist

1897
01:54:03.431 --> 01:54:05.140
with this mixture,
right?

1898
01:54:05.230 --> 01:54:10.230
Who's to say that life with a thicker mixture isn't also possible and might be

1899
01:54:12.131 --> 01:54:14.520
going on around us all the time.
Like,

1900
01:54:14.590 --> 01:54:19.590
cause there might be these porous sort of entryways into these other dementia

1901
01:54:21.761 --> 01:54:25.510
calls that are consistently open and closed and they're constantly around us all

1902
01:54:25.511 --> 01:54:26.950
the time.
But when we're,

1903
01:54:27.010 --> 01:54:31.060
when we're just in straight normal consciousness that we experience without

1904
01:54:31.090 --> 01:54:34.570
perturbing it with alcohol or pot or psychedelics,

1905
01:54:34.840 --> 01:54:38.890
we want to think that this is reality.
This is rigid,
this is it,

1906
01:54:39.250 --> 01:54:44.170
but maybe it's of reality.
Yeah,
it is a fuck load of them.

1907
01:54:44.500 --> 01:54:47.620
Maybe when you make decisions,
you enter into different ones.

1908
01:54:48.160 --> 01:54:53.020
Maybe you're constantly shifting the one that's around you and how you interact

1909
01:54:53.021 --> 01:54:53.854
with people.

1910
01:54:53.860 --> 01:54:56.980
You mean like your decisions or the way you navigate through the multiverse?

1911
01:54:57.010 --> 01:55:00.760
It's entirely possible,
right?
Yeah.
Yeah man.
I want to say that too many times.

1912
01:55:01.360 --> 01:55:03.880
It is a thing.
If you,
if you,

1913
01:55:04.330 --> 01:55:09.280
if you just think about how little we understand about consciousness,

1914
01:55:09.520 --> 01:55:10.750
about happens when you die,

1915
01:55:10.751 --> 01:55:14.000
what happens when you sleep with how little we know about what,

1916
01:55:14.001 --> 01:55:16.570
what is going on when you're communicating with people,

1917
01:55:16.780 --> 01:55:19.300
what is going on when you're interacting with people,
what did we,

1918
01:55:19.301 --> 01:55:21.700
are these fucking ideas coming from?
Yeah.

1919
01:55:21.790 --> 01:55:26.790
Are these ideas little life forms in a non observed state?

1920
01:55:29.400 --> 01:55:31.630
Yeah,
man,
Bro,
you take it off the glasses.
You're getting crazy.

1921
01:55:31.631 --> 01:55:34.390
I just realized I didn't get to look at your beautiful eyes show.

1922
01:55:34.391 --> 01:55:36.770
It was enjoying this.
We did it for hours.
Um,

1923
01:55:38.970 --> 01:55:42.070
star bright in here,
but the,
you know,

1924
01:55:42.071 --> 01:55:44.040
man like that when you start the

1925
01:55:44.040 --> 01:55:47.040
<v 6>thing you're saying about psychedelics kind of like showing you a different way</v>

1926
01:55:47.041 --> 01:55:49.230
and that when you're in a base reality state,

1927
01:55:49.231 --> 01:55:54.231
your people spend a lot of energy trying to imagine a solidity that isn't really

1928
01:55:55.561 --> 01:55:58.410
there.
Yeah.
And like,
you know,

1929
01:55:58.530 --> 01:56:02.760
as I've been taught by some people that you know,

1930
01:56:02.761 --> 01:56:06.960
you if you start breaking it down just logically,
uh,

1931
01:56:07.050 --> 01:56:10.860
for example like uh,
you know,
your past for example,
you know,
you ever do that,

1932
01:56:10.861 --> 01:56:13.680
spend any time with your memories and you realize like,

1933
01:56:13.681 --> 01:56:16.800
well now your most vivid memory,
whatever it may be,

1934
01:56:18.510 --> 01:56:23.510
you can't really taste what you're eating or feel that euphoria that you were

1935
01:56:24.541 --> 01:56:27.810
feeling or the fear of you are feeling or whatever.
Cause if you did,
then you,

1936
01:56:27.840 --> 01:56:32.330
the memory would not work for a person who was trying to like stay alive cause

1937
01:56:32.331 --> 01:56:35.550
you,
and if you just remember the last time you got punched in the face you would

1938
01:56:35.551 --> 01:56:36.990
feel it.
You know.

1939
01:56:36.991 --> 01:56:40.890
And also if you could remember tastes you wouldn't be so inclined to eat because

1940
01:56:40.891 --> 01:56:44.160
you could just go back and think to the last chocolate bar you a and you would

1941
01:56:44.161 --> 01:56:48.690
taste it.
Or obviously if you could remember orgasms as they are,

1942
01:56:48.900 --> 01:56:50.010
you wouldn't really need to fuck.

1943
01:56:50.011 --> 01:56:53.850
You would just think about having sex whenever you had it and you would come,

1944
01:56:53.851 --> 01:56:54.870
you'd feel like you were coming.

1945
01:56:54.871 --> 01:56:59.871
So if we look at memories experientials there's a lot of like senses that aren't

1946
01:56:59.911 --> 01:57:03.540
gratified by memory.
And also if you look at them from the visual field,

1947
01:57:04.140 --> 01:57:09.140
even the most profoundly quote photographic memory is wavery at best it's not

1948
01:57:10.530 --> 01:57:13.170
HD.
It certainly wouldn't be a four K TV.

1949
01:57:13.171 --> 01:57:17.790
It's got to kind of like a quality to it that is just,
Oh you know,

1950
01:57:17.820 --> 01:57:19.980
flow.
It's a little transparent.

1951
01:57:20.190 --> 01:57:24.930
So then when we think about the future,
obviously that doesn't exist.

1952
01:57:24.930 --> 01:57:26.880
Like it's,
there's just no future.

1953
01:57:26.920 --> 01:57:29.850
That's nothing is outside of this point in time.

1954
01:57:30.300 --> 01:57:35.300
And so then now you've basically just from a simple analysis of your memories,

1955
01:57:35.641 --> 01:57:37.710
which a lot of people imagine that's who they are.

1956
01:57:37.950 --> 01:57:41.010
Like there a snake in the present moments,

1957
01:57:41.011 --> 01:57:45.090
the head and the back is the past with all their memories sort of intertwined.

1958
01:57:45.091 --> 01:57:46.080
But you realize like no,

1959
01:57:46.470 --> 01:57:51.360
that's really foggy approximation of what happened at best and you really don't

1960
01:57:51.361 --> 01:57:53.400
remember most of the shit you did anyway.

1961
01:57:53.401 --> 01:57:56.700
Like you don't remember what you ate three days ago,
10 days ago.

1962
01:57:56.970 --> 01:57:59.250
So then you realize your whole path,

1963
01:57:59.280 --> 01:58:02.070
the thing you've been using to define yourself as a person,

1964
01:58:02.370 --> 01:58:04.980
you barely remember it and the parts you do remember it,

1965
01:58:05.310 --> 01:58:09.900
they're not really clear.
So that's gone now.
That's death.
You're dead.

1966
01:58:09.960 --> 01:58:12.990
Anything that happened before this moment,
that's death.
It's gone.

1967
01:58:12.991 --> 01:58:15.450
There's just this for real.
That's not now.

1968
01:58:15.451 --> 01:58:18.810
There might be some neurological and coding,
but there's no past.
Forget it.

1969
01:58:19.330 --> 01:58:22.870
<v 1>It's why people are to get really good at things,
you know?
Well,</v>

1970
01:58:22.871 --> 01:58:24.940
you mean it gives them a sense of stability.

1971
01:58:25.870 --> 01:58:30.130
That's why if you have a physical skill,
like say you could do gymnastics.

1972
01:58:30.490 --> 01:58:34.600
Do you know Chappelle Lacey?
No.
Funny.
Funny up and coming new comic.

1973
01:58:34.601 --> 01:58:38.260
But he was a world champion cheerleader like uh,

1974
01:58:38.290 --> 01:58:42.670
like crazy skills and he's jacked.
Built like a linebacker.
Well,
don't let go.

1975
01:58:42.790 --> 01:58:45.760
I don't know.
Football.
Defensive back running back.
Anyway.

1976
01:58:46.120 --> 01:58:50.800
Stud could do a backflip.
Just jump through the air and land and you're like,
why?

1977
01:58:50.830 --> 01:58:54.160
Like what the fuck?
Yeah.
Right.
When he does that,

1978
01:58:54.190 --> 01:58:58.270
he knows that he had those experiences.
You learn how to do that.
He has a skill,

1979
01:58:58.510 --> 01:59:02.140
has a very unusual skill.
Yeah.
Like,
like a break dancer.

1980
01:59:02.380 --> 01:59:06.070
They know they can do that crazy shit with,
they can hop around on one arm.
Yeah.

1981
01:59:06.160 --> 01:59:08.950
Their feet up in the air.
Criss crossing and going into the Lotus position.

1982
01:59:09.850 --> 01:59:11.860
How many people can do that?
They can do that.
They could do it.

1983
01:59:11.890 --> 01:59:16.030
That defines their existence in a way.
Yeah.

1984
01:59:16.060 --> 01:59:19.210
Because now they're not just living in the moment.

1985
01:59:19.450 --> 01:59:23.530
They also have knowledge.
They Chapelle crazy.
Yeah.

1986
01:59:23.950 --> 01:59:27.640
Fucking nuts,
dude.
There's one that he sent me,
I'll send it to you,
Jamie,

1987
01:59:27.970 --> 01:59:32.180
where um,
he flips a girl through the air,
look at that shit.

1988
01:59:32.181 --> 01:59:37.181
Or you can do flips a girl through the air and then catches her on one hand and

1989
01:59:37.331 --> 01:59:41.020
presses her above his head.
Crazy.
Dude.

1990
01:59:41.320 --> 01:59:43.810
It's fucking bananas.
Bananas,
banana.

1991
01:59:43.811 --> 01:59:46.870
So he knows that he can do those things.

1992
01:59:46.900 --> 01:59:49.230
He knows you can do those things because he learn those things.
Yeah.

1993
01:59:49.270 --> 01:59:53.800
Those things carry him.
They defined you.
They give you extra value.

1994
01:59:54.430 --> 01:59:58.330
You can hold onto them as a support,
like a security blanket.

1995
01:59:58.490 --> 02:00:01.180
And it's crazy world.
Hey,
I can play the piano,
mother fucker.

1996
02:00:01.510 --> 02:00:05.150
Let me get on the piano.
I'm going to show everybody at the party.
Um,
Dube head.

1997
02:00:05.160 --> 02:00:05.560
I think

1998
02:00:05.560 --> 02:00:09.730
<v 6>the is that you don't,
oh man.
Oh my God.</v>

1999
02:00:12.140 --> 02:00:16.580
<v 1>Yeah,
man.
He's just sing the song tonight.</v>

2000
02:00:17.440 --> 02:00:20.940
Oh,
in the MOU from melody.

2001
02:00:21.470 --> 02:00:25.190
<v 6>I exist.
I am [inaudible].</v>

2002
02:00:25.720 --> 02:00:26.910
I'm real.
I'm trying

2003
02:00:27.000 --> 02:00:30.640
<v 1>give something.
Put China spray something out in the world.</v>

2004
02:00:30.641 --> 02:00:35.080
The people like the smell,
so they come closer to my flowers,
right,
man.
Ah,

2005
02:00:35.180 --> 02:00:39.670
you deserve more Dunkin.
You can sing.
You should sing all the time everywhere.

2006
02:00:39.730 --> 02:00:43.570
Oh thanks.
You just saying,
oh you shouldn't even talk.
You're an angel.
I know.

2007
02:00:43.600 --> 02:00:46.510
The way you sing is amazing.
Well I trained for five years.

2008
02:00:46.511 --> 02:00:48.370
I just like to sit around and listen to you.

2009
02:00:48.520 --> 02:00:51.160
Have you ever been in a party where somebody breaks out a guitar and actually

2010
02:00:51.161 --> 02:00:52.750
sings a song like animal house style?

2011
02:00:53.420 --> 02:00:58.300
<v 6>Well,
uh,
that scene is amazing.
Yeah.
Yeah,
I have.</v>

2012
02:00:59.290 --> 02:01:00.260
I'm trying to remember.

2013
02:01:00.380 --> 02:01:04.790
I think if that has happened it's one of the memories I,

2014
02:01:04.840 --> 02:01:05.471
my brain is like,

2015
02:01:05.471 --> 02:01:07.900
we're not going to remember that we're not carrying that with us cause it would

2016
02:01:07.901 --> 02:01:10.420
much cause it's holding a hostage situation.
Let's face it.

2017
02:01:10.421 --> 02:01:12.820
Like once they sit down and start strumming that shit.

2018
02:01:13.060 --> 02:01:16.000
If you're the guy who walks out,
look at that fucking hater.

2019
02:01:16.420 --> 02:01:20.200
He can't play guitars,
egos being challenged when the reality is you're like,

2020
02:01:20.260 --> 02:01:21.340
I don't want to deal with it,
man.

2021
02:01:21.341 --> 02:01:26.341
I don't want to deal with all the levels of having to face the fact that you

2022
02:01:26.740 --> 02:01:29.650
fired a neuron that made it seem okay.

2023
02:01:29.651 --> 02:01:33.640
That in the middle of a party where nobody was playing music or maybe music was

2024
02:01:33.641 --> 02:01:35.240
playing.
You turn it off.
Dude.

2025
02:01:35.360 --> 02:01:40.360
<v 1>I know of a guy who in the middle of a football game pause the game to show his</v>

2026
02:01:41.721 --> 02:01:46.190
acting real well.
That's just lunacy.
That's it.
No,

2027
02:01:46.191 --> 02:01:49.490
that's someone who's like sick.
Paused the game.

2028
02:01:49.520 --> 02:01:54.520
Just a broken man or woman paused the game to show an acting reel.

2029
02:01:55.880 --> 02:01:59.060
Shambling how my new real man,
you guys gotta check this out.
The game can wait.

2030
02:01:59.090 --> 02:02:01.760
Seriously guys to game Kuwait.
He did a great job.

2031
02:02:01.790 --> 02:02:05.120
You're going to get great pleasure out of watching me fake.

2032
02:02:06.170 --> 02:02:09.290
Watch me fake now I'm a detective.
Okay at me.
I've got a gun,

2033
02:02:10.050 --> 02:02:14.630
<v 2>dude.
It's,
it's,
it's a hunger cause it's,
this is,</v>

2034
02:02:14.650 --> 02:02:18.660
this is the quiet,
I mean it's like you're talking about back flips.
It's like,

2035
02:02:18.740 --> 02:02:20.520
imagine this self is so

2036
02:02:22.170 --> 02:02:26.990
the self is so imaginary that we have to exert to the point of doing back flips

2037
02:02:27.360 --> 02:02:32.130
to give us a sense that the self,
my spears,
we think it is.
It's,
that's right.

2038
02:02:32.310 --> 02:02:36.120
Like you don't have to exert to be sitting in a chair.

2039
02:02:36.270 --> 02:02:39.540
Gravity does it for you.
There is no energy that needs to be exerted.

2040
02:02:39.570 --> 02:02:42.150
But how often do you hear someone saying,

2041
02:02:42.750 --> 02:02:46.470
what a great day either.
There's a great day,

2042
02:02:47.210 --> 02:02:50.580
great day,
amazing,
but why are you saying it?

2043
02:02:50.790 --> 02:02:55.790
Like why do you feel the need to exert this much energy to announce to me it's a

2044
02:02:56.011 --> 02:03:00.780
great day.
Hmm.
Could it be that you're not quite certain it's a great day?

2045
02:03:00.990 --> 02:03:04.140
Could it be that there's a feeling in you that something's a little amiss,

2046
02:03:04.230 --> 02:03:08.550
so you gotta like paint reality with words to make it okay,

2047
02:03:08.880 --> 02:03:11.460
this isn't a ghost story.
I'm not going to die,

2048
02:03:11.560 --> 02:03:14.800
<v 1>is it?
Or is by saying it's a great day.</v>

2049
02:03:15.280 --> 02:03:19.850
Are you putting out this hope that I'm going to go,
wow,
Dunkin,

2050
02:03:19.860 --> 02:03:24.340
such a positive guy.
He's amazing.
Yeah.
When he says it's a great day,

2051
02:03:24.341 --> 02:03:28.900
I feel it is a great day.
He puts me in a better mood.
Thanks,
Duncan.

2052
02:03:28.980 --> 02:03:32.940
<v 2>Yeah,
I mean,
I think if you look at,
anytime I've done that shit,</v>

2053
02:03:33.300 --> 02:03:34.200
I'm too high.

2054
02:03:34.400 --> 02:03:38.220
I'm getting paranoid and I'm trying to get some affirmation from a friend,

2055
02:03:38.420 --> 02:03:40.660
you know?
That's usually the feeling is one of me.

2056
02:03:40.661 --> 02:03:45.390
Like you know like when you're around someone you realize like they want me to

2057
02:03:45.391 --> 02:03:49.170
compliment them right now.
They are,
and you feel that like when they,

2058
02:03:49.440 --> 02:03:51.840
when they open the fucking doors and a spaceship,

2059
02:03:52.100 --> 02:03:57.100
you temporarily open the doors of the infinite vacuum of that worst.

2060
02:03:57.571 --> 02:03:57.720
Yeah.

2061
02:03:57.720 --> 02:04:01.770
<v 1>When they'd get upset.
When you don't compromise.
Yeah.
Wow.</v>

2062
02:04:02.010 --> 02:04:04.530
That's the craziest.
Duncan have known you for a long time.

2063
02:04:04.531 --> 02:04:07.750
You'd never complimented my art.
Oh Wow.

2064
02:04:07.770 --> 02:04:11.550
Sandcastles or my life and I know you don't,
you know,

2065
02:04:11.700 --> 02:04:14.160
you don't even say they're cool.
They're fucking great man.
Okay.

2066
02:04:14.250 --> 02:04:16.180
You're saying castles are incredible.
I mean,
you know,

2067
02:04:16.181 --> 02:04:17.550
it's just weird that I have to tell you.

2068
02:04:18.520 --> 02:04:22.780
<v 2>Yeah,
I know.
I'm sorry man.
You're great.
You're great.
We worship you will,</v>

2069
02:04:22.781 --> 02:04:26.350
where should be forever.
You'll be known forever is a great sandcastle maker.

2070
02:04:26.740 --> 02:04:27.850
That's a funny thing.

2071
02:04:28.000 --> 02:04:32.740
It did also add to that that the very same sort of person who is intent on

2072
02:04:32.741 --> 02:04:34.930
getting you to acknowledge their fucking sandcastles,

2073
02:04:35.140 --> 02:04:38.190
which is a great description of it because no matter what

2074
02:04:38.190 --> 02:04:40.980
<v 6>you're doing,
it's a fucking sand castle.
Look at those glaciers.</v>

2075
02:04:41.010 --> 02:04:42.900
They're using whatever you're doing for get it,

2076
02:04:43.140 --> 02:04:48.140
but then you have these people who are on top of this sick need for a person to

2077
02:04:48.331 --> 02:04:52.620
affirm their existence by complimenting their ridiculous sandcastle art.

2078
02:04:53.040 --> 02:04:57.570
They also want to leave a legacy.
That's funny.
Shit.

2079
02:04:57.810 --> 02:05:01.020
It's like they,
it's not enough that we worship you now.

2080
02:05:01.200 --> 02:05:03.730
You want generations of people to worship.
Hmm.

2081
02:05:04.280 --> 02:05:07.970
<v 1>That's a big one for people leaving a legacy.
That's a big one for artists.</v>

2082
02:05:08.000 --> 02:05:12.050
Big One for athletes.
Athletes want to believe records that no one will break.

2083
02:05:12.350 --> 02:05:15.590
<v 6>That's right.
Leave a legacy behind.
Man.
This to me,</v>

2084
02:05:15.591 --> 02:05:20.591
this is like being in a dream and wanting to leave a memory of yourself in a

2085
02:05:20.841 --> 02:05:24.560
dream.
You know,
like you want your,
I want my did people I met in that dream.

2086
02:05:24.950 --> 02:05:28.280
I want their kids to be talking about me after I wake up.

2087
02:05:28.580 --> 02:05:32.240
It's like when you die,
you know it's done.

2088
02:05:32.540 --> 02:05:37.070
We don't know exactly what's after this,
but you're pretty much recycled,
man.

2089
02:05:37.071 --> 02:05:38.660
There might be some karmic momentum.

2090
02:05:38.661 --> 02:05:43.030
There might be some kind of like some residue in trays all over again or your

2091
02:05:43.060 --> 02:05:46.580
Peter Scratch.
I often gotten that yet

2092
02:05:46.610 --> 02:05:50.990
<v 1>the whales to sells three and then you just keep doing in infinity to get it</v>

2093
02:05:50.991 --> 02:05:51.824
right.

2094
02:05:52.090 --> 02:05:53.140
<v 6>That loop going.</v>

2095
02:05:53.170 --> 02:05:57.610
Keep that loop go and like where we're essentially in some kind of like Karmic

2096
02:05:57.700 --> 02:05:59.320
sanding mechanisms,
right?

2097
02:05:59.470 --> 02:06:03.040
<v 1>If you like life,
why wouldn't you want to do it again?
There's Enlighta.</v>

2098
02:06:03.200 --> 02:06:05.640
It wasn't if you like life,
do you like life?
Yes.

2099
02:06:05.850 --> 02:06:10.200
If you found out that this was what you were going to do forever and ever and

2100
02:06:10.201 --> 02:06:13.860
ever and it's going to repeat itself over and over and over again,

2101
02:06:13.890 --> 02:06:17.670
would you like,
no,
it's pointless.
It's pointless now and it's finite.

2102
02:06:18.450 --> 02:06:23.040
Is it different if it's pointless,
as infinite?
Is it different?
Is Different?

2103
02:06:23.041 --> 02:06:26.550
Don't you just enjoy life?
Is that the key?
The key to just enjoy life?

2104
02:06:26.940 --> 02:06:30.450
That's where it's ironic when you pick up a skill,

2105
02:06:30.451 --> 02:06:33.510
like learn to play the piano or learn to do back flips,
or in my case,

2106
02:06:33.511 --> 02:06:37.500
learn to do martial arts is that you actually become a better person through

2107
02:06:37.501 --> 02:06:40.530
learning how to do something.
Cause it's hard.
So you learn about yourself,

2108
02:06:40.950 --> 02:06:43.800
you learn who you are,
you learn the bullshit that you tell yourself,

2109
02:06:43.960 --> 02:06:46.260
like to really get good at something.
Like if you want to get that good,

2110
02:06:46.261 --> 02:06:49.830
it's doing backflips man,
you gotta fucking actually practice.

2111
02:06:49.860 --> 02:06:53.330
You can't bullshit yourself and really don't need to come into the yard to do

2112
02:06:53.340 --> 02:06:57.330
with that guy can do.
You got fucking practice.
And by practicing,

2113
02:06:57.570 --> 02:07:02.570
you put yourself through this rigid exercise routine and you do it correctly and

2114
02:07:03.001 --> 02:07:06.480
you exert yourself and you have to do,
it requires 100% of your focus.

2115
02:07:06.481 --> 02:07:07.530
And in doing so,

2116
02:07:07.531 --> 02:07:11.940
whether it's playing piano or throwing kicks or whatever the fuck it is in doing

2117
02:07:11.941 --> 02:07:15.900
so,
you understand yourself better.
Yeah.
So,
even though I radically,

2118
02:07:16.080 --> 02:07:21.080
you're kind of defining who you are as a person and you're giving yourself like

2119
02:07:21.571 --> 02:07:25.950
extra clout because you're,
uh,
you're the fucking man at Dunkin,

2120
02:07:25.951 --> 02:07:29.280
a ball into a net.
I'm the fucking man.
Everybody watched and watched assholes.

2121
02:07:29.310 --> 02:07:32.100
Yeah.
But by doing that,

2122
02:07:32.101 --> 02:07:35.810
you actually learned how to become a better person too because hard because it's

2123
02:07:35.811 --> 02:07:39.020
hard to do.
And then if you can figure it out,

2124
02:07:39.380 --> 02:07:44.380
the puzzle will help you get a better hold of all your human skills because it

2125
02:07:46.361 --> 02:07:48.980
would be a difficult thing if you really want to get good at something.

2126
02:07:49.010 --> 02:07:50.600
If you really want to leave behind a legacy,

2127
02:07:50.601 --> 02:07:55.601
like you have to achieve a level of focus and a level of intense thinking and

2128
02:07:56.630 --> 02:08:00.170
concentration that most people are just going to Peter out before they get to

2129
02:08:00.171 --> 02:08:00.600
that spot.

2130
02:08:00.600 --> 02:08:01.590
<v 6>Sure.
I mean,</v>

2131
02:08:01.591 --> 02:08:06.591
that's what I love about what you're talking about is it's a force field in

2132
02:08:06.691 --> 02:08:11.691
between you and an elite like fuck the Illuminati.

2133
02:08:12.660 --> 02:08:17.660
The force field of the learning curve separates every single person from a

2134
02:08:17.881 --> 02:08:22.680
terrain that cannot be reached with money.
Like,
I don't care how rich you are.

2135
02:08:22.920 --> 02:08:24.600
If you want to learn how to do a back flip,

2136
02:08:24.601 --> 02:08:26.550
you might be able to pay for great trainers,

2137
02:08:26.910 --> 02:08:28.980
but you still got to do the fucking work.

2138
02:08:28.981 --> 02:08:32.280
You got to do the work 100% so this is cool because you now,

2139
02:08:32.310 --> 02:08:36.000
you enter into a realm that is inaccessible by money,

2140
02:08:36.320 --> 02:08:37.830
is inaccessible by power,

2141
02:08:37.831 --> 02:08:42.540
but is weirdly generally accessible by anybody.
In other words,

2142
02:08:42.541 --> 02:08:47.100
the only thing keeping you from whatever the fucking thing is you want to get

2143
02:08:47.101 --> 02:08:51.840
good at to show yourself that it is possible to leave the reality that you're in

2144
02:08:51.841 --> 02:08:54.540
and enter a completely different reality.
Because yeah,
for me,

2145
02:08:54.810 --> 02:08:57.330
if suddenly I was in a world where I could do fucking back flips,

2146
02:08:57.580 --> 02:08:59.250
might as well be an alternate dimension.

2147
02:08:59.460 --> 02:09:02.970
Like if I got home and did a back flip in front of my wife,
she would,

2148
02:09:03.000 --> 02:09:07.230
it would be that.
She would probably be more amazing if I like levitated.

2149
02:09:07.710 --> 02:09:08.740
You know what I mean?
She'd be like,

2150
02:09:08.840 --> 02:09:11.390
<v 10>what the fuck have you done where you've,
you've</v>

2151
02:09:11.510 --> 02:09:15.710
<v 6>reality must be fragmented.
So it's like,
in other words,
the you,</v>

2152
02:09:15.711 --> 02:09:18.560
wherever you're at,
whatever the thing is that you,
you are,

2153
02:09:18.890 --> 02:09:22.220
there's always this interesting mountainous,

2154
02:09:22.221 --> 02:09:27.221
rugged terrain separating you from a completely different universe where you can

2155
02:09:28.551 --> 02:09:31.310
do back flips,
play the piano,
play the guitar,

2156
02:09:31.550 --> 02:09:35.240
whatever the fucking specific thing it is you want to pick up.

2157
02:09:35.270 --> 02:09:35.991
That's kind of cool.

2158
02:09:35.991 --> 02:09:40.130
To me it's like the only thing keeping you from it is consistency.

2159
02:09:40.340 --> 02:09:44.120
It's not money usually unless it's like you want to be a falconer year or some

2160
02:09:44.121 --> 02:09:48.530
shit.
You got to get a falcon,
but in general,
you know you could like,

2161
02:09:48.950 --> 02:09:52.570
that's why I live about that.
Goggins man.
I like that guy like you.

2162
02:09:52.571 --> 02:09:55.110
It's weird how much he impacts me even though I'm still fucking,

2163
02:09:57.810 --> 02:09:58.940
<v 10>I will look</v>

2164
02:09:59.920 --> 02:10:01.860
<v 6>and I like,
I like it.</v>

2165
02:10:02.020 --> 02:10:06.460
At one point I thought someone was running next to him filming him before I

2166
02:10:06.461 --> 02:10:10.480
realized it was a car and I'm like,
I want to know is filming God steady?
Yeah,

2167
02:10:10.481 --> 02:10:10.781
it's,
yeah.

2168
02:10:10.781 --> 02:10:14.190
I realized I was disappointed because I thought there was an anonymous and

2169
02:10:14.191 --> 02:10:17.590
anonymous.
Yeah,
he's running,
getting no credit at all.

2170
02:10:18.270 --> 02:10:20.170
It's probably his fiance,
but you know,

2171
02:10:20.171 --> 02:10:25.090
that's to me that's kind of why I love that because it's like it's equal access.

2172
02:10:25.420 --> 02:10:28.300
No one is being barred from the learning curve.

2173
02:10:28.330 --> 02:10:32.500
Now the specific learning curve you might be getting barred from,

2174
02:10:32.501 --> 02:10:34.370
you know what I mean?
Like do you want to Mow Guan

2175
02:10:34.370 --> 02:10:37.160
<v 4>it's 8,000 fucking dollars.
Okay.
Like you're not going to get that.</v>

2176
02:10:37.161 --> 02:10:39.530
You're not going to learn to play that if you don't have that kind of money.

2177
02:10:39.580 --> 02:10:42.890
It's a mug one.
It's like something that fell out of his space.

2178
02:10:42.891 --> 02:10:47.390
Ship that I'm obsessed with that like it's just this beautiful synthesizer man.

2179
02:10:47.610 --> 02:10:52.400
It's like
fill out of a spaceship.
Dude.
I have to Piss so bad.

2180
02:10:52.610 --> 02:10:56.060
Can you talk to Jamie and then I'll let you pee pee too.
Right?

2181
02:10:56.450 --> 02:10:57.500
How did you know man?

2182
02:10:57.501 --> 02:11:00.590
Cause I could tell shared mine cause I'm wriggling you're moving a little funny.

2183
02:11:00.620 --> 02:11:02.960
Yeah.
Yeah.
Who wants to be first?
You want to first?

2184
02:11:03.320 --> 02:11:05.000
What a Fucking Gentleman You pee first.

2185
02:11:05.001 --> 02:11:08.860
Cause if you announced it you got to go I think on your way.
Okay,

2186
02:11:08.960 --> 02:11:13.900
I'll be right back.
Okay,
great.
I was like,
look this up.
The mood one.
Yeah,

2187
02:11:13.910 --> 02:11:18.020
forget it.
What do you where you have a mode right now though,
right?

2188
02:11:18.050 --> 02:11:22.040
I got to sub 37 but um,
the,
you know,

2189
02:11:22.041 --> 02:11:24.230
the Mo one is um,

2190
02:11:24.260 --> 02:11:29.260
polyphonic and the sub 37 is monophonic so he can't really play chords on it.

2191
02:11:29.750 --> 02:11:33.320
Uh,
but it's not just that,
it's like the whole,

2192
02:11:33.321 --> 02:11:38.000
I mean it's a colt around these sense because they did figure out a way to dial

2193
02:11:38.001 --> 02:11:40.130
in as perfect specific,

2194
02:11:40.520 --> 02:11:44.810
beautiful sound that once you even,

2195
02:11:45.050 --> 02:11:47.060
I mean if you like playing music,
which you know,

2196
02:11:47.061 --> 02:11:48.400
I just do is that you play with toys.

2197
02:11:48.440 --> 02:11:50.180
I feel like I asked you to see it like a year ago.

2198
02:11:50.181 --> 02:11:52.110
What you just play for yourself most.

2199
02:11:52.111 --> 02:11:56.090
Like you just like to sit in a room and turn off the light or put on mood lights

2200
02:11:56.091 --> 02:12:00.440
or whatever and just make your own music instead of listening to what people are

2201
02:12:00.441 --> 02:12:05.210
making for you to listen.
Yeah.
Well I mean I like both,
but I just,
I like the,

2202
02:12:05.660 --> 02:12:08.840
with Cynthia musical synthesis,
I really,

2203
02:12:08.930 --> 02:12:11.990
there's like a weird kind of philosophy behind it.

2204
02:12:11.991 --> 02:12:16.700
Which is not only do you not have to worry about making,
you know,
whatever it is,

2205
02:12:16.840 --> 02:12:18.080
I'm an album or something,

2206
02:12:18.081 --> 02:12:23.081
but it kind of like allow yourself a break from imagining you even need to be

2207
02:12:24.651 --> 02:12:26.480
musical.
Just like,
you know,

2208
02:12:26.481 --> 02:12:31.370
you give kids pots and pans and they fucking thing it together.
It's just fun.

2209
02:12:31.400 --> 02:12:35.540
A friend of mine,
uh,
Billy Mays,
the third,
he's actually the son of Billy Mays.

2210
02:12:35.541 --> 02:12:38.520
He travels around playing music as a on a,

2211
02:12:38.530 --> 02:12:41.540
on an under a name called infinite third and he does a thing called mouth

2212
02:12:41.541 --> 02:12:43.100
council,
which sounds like almost what you're doing,

2213
02:12:43.101 --> 02:12:47.090
where he takes a loop pedal as a microphone.
He starts,
it makes us sound,

2214
02:12:47.091 --> 02:12:49.880
and then he passes it around to the next person.
It's like you have it,

2215
02:12:49.881 --> 02:12:50.714
you make a sound.

2216
02:12:51.020 --> 02:12:53.420
Then Joe would make a sound and then by the end of the eight person,

2217
02:12:53.421 --> 02:12:54.254
nine person thing,

2218
02:12:54.410 --> 02:12:57.320
he knows how to use the pedal enough that it becomes basically a song,

2219
02:12:57.950 --> 02:13:01.210
almost like a song.
It's a drip assist,
the droning loop.
So it's not really,
yeah,

2220
02:13:01.211 --> 02:13:02.470
no,
it's probably,
but it's,

2221
02:13:02.760 --> 02:13:06.020
it's almost like this and he does very similar things with,
by himself.

2222
02:13:06.560 --> 02:13:08.900
It gets real cool.
But it's just like,
like what you're saying though,

2223
02:13:08.901 --> 02:13:13.210
it's not music to listen to necessarily got structure.
Uh,
it's,

2224
02:13:13.470 --> 02:13:17.390
it's to have on in the background sort of and like,
yeah,

2225
02:13:17.420 --> 02:13:20.660
whatever you're doing really used in lots of ways.
It's like,
yeah,

2226
02:13:20.661 --> 02:13:22.160
I think it's just like,
you know,

2227
02:13:22.161 --> 02:13:25.970
you could be whoever this is is clearly a great what it musician,

2228
02:13:25.971 --> 02:13:30.971
but also you can just enjoy dialing in these like insane alien noises for no

2229
02:13:33.271 --> 02:13:37.650
reason other than you just are trying to make sounds.
And that's it.
I mean,

2230
02:13:37.920 --> 02:13:42.180
it really is like you take that and combine it with most any psychedelic

2231
02:13:43.080 --> 02:13:48.080
marijuana and what you have there is the ultimate fucking spaceship essentially

2232
02:13:49.651 --> 02:13:52.590
that you're just like,
you don't need,
we're just talking about,
it's not,

2233
02:13:52.591 --> 02:13:55.770
the idea behind this is you can get good at it and these things are so precisely

2234
02:13:55.771 --> 02:13:59.070
dialed in that if you want it to be like the uh,
you know,

2235
02:13:59.220 --> 02:14:02.220
they teach you music just from interacting with it.

2236
02:14:02.221 --> 02:14:07.221
But also there's just this visceral like pleasure of making noises through

2237
02:14:07.381 --> 02:14:09.420
sense,
you know?
Yeah.

2238
02:14:09.510 --> 02:14:12.510
I often think what would happen if you got sucked into this world like

2239
02:14:12.630 --> 02:14:15.990
physiology.
That's me.
Evil on me.
Ricky,
Bobby,

2240
02:14:16.020 --> 02:14:18.770
I would like to put that evil on you.
That'd be fucking cool.

2241
02:14:19.080 --> 02:14:20.380
You start playing them more often.

2242
02:14:20.490 --> 02:14:23.060
<v 1>Playing quake had to swear off of it</v>

2243
02:14:23.610 --> 02:14:27.910
<v 4>again.
Again,
I now hours a day hours.
When you asked me,</v>

2244
02:14:28.120 --> 02:14:32.350
you texted do I play quake and I got the same feeling you get when you have a

2245
02:14:32.351 --> 02:14:36.760
friend who's like gone sober and they're like asking you to look,
get a drink.

2246
02:14:37.240 --> 02:14:37.430
Okay.

2247
02:14:37.430 --> 02:14:42.370
<v 1>Yeah,
man.
I had a problem playing hours a day and I just went cold Turkey.</v>

2248
02:14:42.371 --> 02:14:44.150
I went,
stop.
What are you doing?

2249
02:14:45.100 --> 02:14:47.530
<v 4>I'm going to go take note.
I'm going to Piss [inaudible].</v>

2250
02:14:47.680 --> 02:14:50.740
How long does it take you to Piss with that?
Soon on?
This is,

2251
02:14:50.920 --> 02:14:55.000
depends on where I'm at.
Like in a combat situation.
Diapers.
Yeah,

2252
02:14:55.090 --> 02:14:59.290
but in general it takes like 30 minutes or so.
Okay.
But I'll be back.
All right,

2253
02:14:59.530 --> 02:15:00.363
great.

2254
02:15:02.170 --> 02:15:05.240
<v 1>I wear diapers and combat.
Excuse me.</v>

2255
02:15:08.750 --> 02:15:12.140
This whole episode,
1313 was a hundred percent Tompkins idea.

2256
02:15:12.470 --> 02:15:14.600
I get this text message from,
hey man,

2257
02:15:15.440 --> 02:15:19.850
can I do episode 1313 just do them.
Figure out the window.

2258
02:15:20.180 --> 02:15:24.320
I'm like fuck yeah,
you can,
I,
I need,
I need to do that with you.
I noticed that.

2259
02:15:24.321 --> 02:15:26.060
I was going to ask if you guys have planned it.
Yeah.

2260
02:15:26.061 --> 02:15:29.210
Well we planned episode six six six that was also his idea.

2261
02:15:29.211 --> 02:15:33.590
That was the last time he wore a pope outfit and I wore my white NASA outfit.

2262
02:15:33.591 --> 02:15:37.550
I have a white NASA outfit and an orange one.
That was awesome.

2263
02:15:38.120 --> 02:15:41.090
Um,
but yeah,
1313 is a real thing.

2264
02:15:41.780 --> 02:15:43.430
But we aren't really on 13,

2265
02:15:43.431 --> 02:15:48.431
13 cause this like podcasts on the planes in they're 70 MMA shows if I

2266
02:15:49.881 --> 02:15:53.450
companion.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Those,
those are hundreds of them.

2267
02:15:54.530 --> 02:15:55.430
That's a crazy number.

2268
02:15:55.430 --> 02:15:56.330
<v 4>Well you guys are talking about,</v>

2269
02:15:56.331 --> 02:15:59.000
I didn't want to interrupt the conversation but this uh,

2270
02:15:59.360 --> 02:16:02.300
as sort of just come out to help with the deep fake stuff.

2271
02:16:02.330 --> 02:16:05.240
Adobe's announced that they've got a tool that they've,

2272
02:16:05.630 --> 02:16:08.210
I don't know how well it works right now that just show a picture so they don't

2273
02:16:08.211 --> 02:16:09.320
show it in action or anything,

2274
02:16:09.680 --> 02:16:13.130
but it's a way to tell if a photo has been manipulated with Photoshop.

2275
02:16:13.810 --> 02:16:18.040
<v 1>Keep that off.
Those Instagram hoes.
Nobody knows that.</v>

2276
02:16:18.041 --> 02:16:21.850
Anybody who looks like,
you know,
I mean do those,
this,

2277
02:16:21.880 --> 02:16:24.790
some Instagram people literally look like cartoons.

2278
02:16:24.980 --> 02:16:26.170
Like do you look at their photos you like,

2279
02:16:26.470 --> 02:16:28.980
<v 4>are you what you're not a professional on a picture.
Yeah.</v>

2280
02:16:28.990 --> 02:16:30.070
I've never fucked with the APP

2281
02:16:30.130 --> 02:16:32.130
<v 1>face.
Face tune I think is a lot of people use,</v>

2282
02:16:32.131 --> 02:16:35.110
is that what the yearly like you can just draw some guys where you do it.
Yeah,

2283
02:16:35.111 --> 02:16:38.100
for sure.
They do.
Their whole face is blurry.
It's like,
what's happening here?

2284
02:16:38.110 --> 02:16:40.000
I had to put my glasses on,
look closer at it.

2285
02:16:40.001 --> 02:16:42.990
I'm like what are you your spray paint?
Weirdly rosy cheeks.
Yeah.

2286
02:16:43.000 --> 02:16:44.050
Your spray person.

2287
02:16:45.510 --> 02:16:48.730
We're talking about Instagram filters like Ai.
Um,

2288
02:16:48.940 --> 02:16:53.290
Adobe's new AI tool can spot when a face has been Photoshop.

2289
02:16:53.380 --> 02:16:57.910
Yeah.
So saying that,
keep that off the Instagram hoes.
Yeah.

2290
02:16:57.911 --> 02:16:58.840
You got like a,

2291
02:16:58.930 --> 02:17:03.460
if no idea that this person who is actually a CGI,
she's like,

2292
02:17:03.490 --> 02:17:06.190
Oh I've heard of that.
Yeah.
People didn't know her name.
Yeah,

2293
02:17:06.340 --> 02:17:09.070
well they're saying they're going to do that at the models now you know they do

2294
02:17:09.071 --> 02:17:11.980
that with houses.
Like sometimes you look at a picture and you're like,

2295
02:17:12.640 --> 02:17:13.780
wait a minute,
is this real?

2296
02:17:13.780 --> 02:17:18.360
And like under construction currently will be completed summer of 2020,

2297
02:17:18.370 --> 02:17:21.490
like Whoa.
So this is not a picture of a house.

2298
02:17:21.690 --> 02:17:26.690
This is a CGI house but sea got shadows and the floor has texture.

2299
02:17:28.481 --> 02:17:30.370
I mean it looks fucking real man.

2300
02:17:30.910 --> 02:17:34.480
I've seen some real ass looking houses and that's,
you know,

2301
02:17:34.481 --> 02:17:36.250
real estate agents use and that shit.

2302
02:17:36.550 --> 02:17:41.380
Why wouldn't like a clothing designer have like the perfect body to compliment

2303
02:17:41.381 --> 02:17:44.080
their perfect clothes,
you know?
Yeah.
That,
um,

2304
02:17:44.290 --> 02:17:47.140
I'm sure you've shown this on your billion times,
but yeah.

2305
02:17:47.141 --> 02:17:50.300
That you're talking about the AI that just generates people.
Yeah.

2306
02:17:50.620 --> 02:17:54.640
That shakes fake models.
Beautiful.
Perfect people in every way.

2307
02:17:55.340 --> 02:17:59.980
Yeah.
In every way.
I agree every way.
Perfect.

2308
02:17:59.981 --> 02:18:01.010
In fact,
it's a,

2309
02:18:01.020 --> 02:18:05.620
it's funny that some people trip out about people that look really good on

2310
02:18:05.621 --> 02:18:10.450
Instagram and they say they're,
they're giving off unrealistic body images.

2311
02:18:10.880 --> 02:18:14.650
Hmm.
And that this is something we should stay away from.
Unreal.

2312
02:18:14.651 --> 02:18:17.910
It's like that guy from vox was doing that about his,

2313
02:18:17.970 --> 02:18:22.030
he got everybody's hating on him cause he was saying that about gay thirst traps

2314
02:18:22.500 --> 02:18:26.320
that they put out unrealistic body images and that you should think about them

2315
02:18:26.321 --> 02:18:31.000
the same way you think about cigarette ads or,
or liquor ads.
Yeah,
exactly.

2316
02:18:31.001 --> 02:18:32.560
What,
no,
they're in shape.

2317
02:18:32.860 --> 02:18:36.400
Unrealistic is such a crazy thing to say when you're actually looking at a real

2318
02:18:36.401 --> 02:18:40.270
person.
Unrealistic body expectations.
Um,
no,

2319
02:18:40.780 --> 02:18:43.540
that guy goes to the gym and that's what you look like when you go to the gym.

2320
02:18:43.541 --> 02:18:48.010
That is real.
That's not just realistic.
That's real.
It's not unrealistic.

2321
02:18:48.790 --> 02:18:53.110
Some people don't want to look at other people that look good.

2322
02:18:54.670 --> 02:18:57.870
I read this article by a therapist who is saying like,
yeah,

2323
02:18:57.880 --> 02:18:59.210
that was the other one to lead.

2324
02:18:59.211 --> 02:19:04.120
You posted that dad bods are more attractive to women than rock hard abs survey

2325
02:19:04.121 --> 02:19:08.530
said they,
that survey said was in front of their fucking fat husbands.

2326
02:19:08.920 --> 02:19:11.500
100% said you use millionaires.
You know?

2327
02:19:11.620 --> 02:19:14.990
Then it's the Chris Pratt and Leonardo DiCaprio as well.

2328
02:19:15.340 --> 02:19:19.360
Chris Pratt is not have a dad bod.
He's sticking his stomach.
Guys been silly.

2329
02:19:19.610 --> 02:19:23.380
That guys jacked me.
I meet him in real life.
He's,
he's a stud.

2330
02:19:24.340 --> 02:19:28.020
Who's the other guy you know?
Caprio do you think the

2331
02:19:28.020 --> 02:19:28.790
<v 6>dad bod,</v>

2332
02:19:28.790 --> 02:19:32.120
you know like you hear this like usually you find out this way down the line,

2333
02:19:32.690 --> 02:19:37.430
but like some phenomenon society was like cooked up in a board room,

2334
02:19:37.460 --> 02:19:40.110
right?
Like,
for example,
let's say,
I dunno,

2335
02:19:40.130 --> 02:19:43.310
you made Twinkies and you realize like,
shit man,

2336
02:19:43.760 --> 02:19:47.930
people like really getting into this ketogenic diet and working out and there

2337
02:19:47.931 --> 02:19:50.660
could be a potential,
you probably have some AI saying like,
hey,

2338
02:19:50.661 --> 02:19:55.300
we've got like a health craze predicted for 2021 meaning twinkie sales are going

2339
02:19:55.301 --> 02:19:59.030
to drop by like 50% because guys don't want to go there,
don't want to be fat.

2340
02:19:59.510 --> 02:20:02.300
And so then you start disseminating into the world like,
all right,

2341
02:20:02.690 --> 02:20:04.310
let's come up with this thing.
What's a,

2342
02:20:04.580 --> 02:20:08.510
what's a way to call somebody out of shape but like to connect it to their

2343
02:20:08.511 --> 02:20:11.720
virility cause they're a dead dad bought yet dad bought.

2344
02:20:11.760 --> 02:20:14.450
So then he started getting it out there.
Like,
you know,

2345
02:20:14.451 --> 02:20:19.451
it helps if any product that is like bad for you kind of depends on two things.

2346
02:20:20.780 --> 02:20:24.230
One,
that it tastes fucking good and two,

2347
02:20:24.410 --> 02:20:28.670
that you can trick yourself into believing it's worth eating,
right?

2348
02:20:28.671 --> 02:20:31.280
Like it needs those two things.
Like,
in other words,

2349
02:20:31.281 --> 02:20:33.620
if there was like delicious uranium,

2350
02:20:33.800 --> 02:20:36.590
like some lunatic created like the sweetest,

2351
02:20:36.890 --> 02:20:40.910
most flavorful uranium biscuit,
you're not gonna eat that shit.

2352
02:20:40.911 --> 02:20:42.530
You know you're going to go to Chernobyl.

2353
02:20:42.531 --> 02:20:45.770
It's fucking all your stomach's gonna melt at the dinner table.

2354
02:20:45.771 --> 02:20:48.590
But if you could come up with like,
you know,

2355
02:20:48.920 --> 02:20:52.220
a nice Ipa like you were saying or some kind of thing that's,

2356
02:20:52.221 --> 02:20:55.550
oh it's just poison.
Basically it's going to destroy your liver over time.

2357
02:20:55.551 --> 02:20:59.500
It'll be a slow progression and you could like sink into alcoholism.
You know,

2358
02:20:59.720 --> 02:21:03.970
your personality will change and it'll be like nobody would do that.
Yeah,
yeah,

2359
02:21:03.980 --> 02:21:06.170
yeah,
yeah,
yeah.
I don't even know what you're saying right now.
Go.

2360
02:21:06.440 --> 02:21:09.380
No one's going to do that.
Such a stupid premise.
No one's going to drink poison.

2361
02:21:09.710 --> 02:21:13.130
Slowly talk to Pfizer with her show.
Who would even do that shit,
man,

2362
02:21:13.131 --> 02:21:14.240
I would never do that.

2363
02:21:14.241 --> 02:21:18.530
I mean I drink cause I'm sophisticated and then like you did you by the way,

2364
02:21:18.531 --> 02:21:22.370
read that shit about how like hangovers or brain damage,

2365
02:21:22.790 --> 02:21:24.860
like when you have a hangover and you get better,

2366
02:21:24.861 --> 02:21:26.360
your brain hasn't recovered yet.

2367
02:21:26.600 --> 02:21:28.940
Just the part that you could sense has gotten better,

2368
02:21:28.941 --> 02:21:33.080
but the you have like physiological damage that's happening.
Of course.

2369
02:21:33.100 --> 02:21:36.470
Like when you read it you're like,
well Duh.

2370
02:21:36.590 --> 02:21:41.420
Of course it's fun.
It's fun to be drunk,
to be drawn to the problem.

2371
02:21:41.780 --> 02:21:46.430
It's fun to be drunk.
Oh my God.
It's fun to be lit if it lands joking.
Ah,

2372
02:21:46.680 --> 02:21:51.380
I mean that's one of the realities of any great thing is like it is a delight

2373
02:21:51.440 --> 02:21:55.520
and it is a beautiful part of life for many people,

2374
02:21:56.000 --> 02:21:59.750
but we at some point you just start tricking yourself.

2375
02:21:59.780 --> 02:22:03.620
I mean that's one of the things Mckenna I love that you said is like how history

2376
02:22:03.621 --> 02:22:05.090
has survived alcohol.

2377
02:22:05.091 --> 02:22:09.590
Like we managed to have that as our sacrament and still we have civilization.

2378
02:22:09.890 --> 02:22:10.730
Wow.

2379
02:22:10.850 --> 02:22:15.080
It's incredible because it didn't like it does turn people into fucking 28 days

2380
02:22:15.081 --> 02:22:17.890
later,
doesn't it?
When some low,
some people don't.

2381
02:22:18.170 --> 02:22:22.460
But it's really interesting when you consider his idea that at one point in time

2382
02:22:22.461 --> 02:22:25.980
there was psychedelic cultures that really didn't have our standard and

2383
02:22:25.980 --> 02:22:29.490
<v 1>toxicants.
Right.
So they didn't have antidepressants,
they didn't have stimulants.</v>

2384
02:22:29.560 --> 02:22:32.250
Yeah.
Unless it was something like coca leaves that they were eating right.

2385
02:22:32.310 --> 02:22:33.870
They didn't have processed cocaine,

2386
02:22:33.871 --> 02:22:38.760
but what they did have was copious amounts of psilocybin.
Yeah,

2387
02:22:39.100 --> 02:22:41.840
Liz surge acid than different plant forms.

2388
02:22:41.850 --> 02:22:46.320
There was like a bunch of different things with the Mayans used Iowasca DMT.

2389
02:22:46.500 --> 02:22:49.380
There was that a,
that shawman where they found his bag.

2390
02:22:49.800 --> 02:22:53.190
They've found it was like a 2000 years.
How many thousand years old?

2391
02:22:53.460 --> 02:22:55.450
2,500 years old.
Had DMT and yes.

2392
02:22:55.930 --> 02:22:58.450
<v 6>Yeah.
It's like any fanny pack you find at burning man.</v>

2393
02:23:03.270 --> 02:23:07.820
<v 10>Probably the same ingredients.
Exactly.</v>

2394
02:23:08.570 --> 02:23:11.000
<v 6>Good.
Yeah,
it was a bit,
yeah.
That's hilarious.</v>

2395
02:23:11.001 --> 02:23:13.130
I love when they find that shit out.
What do you got

2396
02:23:13.270 --> 02:23:18.000
<v 1>that the DMT was in that a rabbit nose thing,
right?
Yeah.
The Fox knows.</v>

2397
02:23:18.001 --> 02:23:19.680
Yes.
That was only a thousand years old.

2398
02:23:19.681 --> 02:23:22.900
I thought you were leading done to that 2,500 year old marijuana that just go.

2399
02:23:22.920 --> 02:23:24.780
Yeah,
that's true too.
That's a new one.
Yeah,

2400
02:23:24.990 --> 02:23:27.800
so people have been just getting blasted forever,
man.
Best.

2401
02:23:27.980 --> 02:23:30.120
Of course they have been.
As soon as they found it,
they were like,

2402
02:23:30.121 --> 02:23:34.120
why would I just go with regular life?
Yeah.
It's the vast,
it's,
it's,

2403
02:23:34.770 --> 02:23:38.670
it's so wonderful that that's being disseminated in a culture right now.

2404
02:23:38.671 --> 02:23:42.300
It's also people are decriminalizing it all over the place,
left and right.

2405
02:23:42.330 --> 02:23:47.130
It's slowly starting to happen.
Colorado first always boom,
they're on track now.

2406
02:23:47.131 --> 02:23:51.090
Oakland,
Oakland decriminalize it as a city.
They put it as the lowest priority.

2407
02:23:51.120 --> 02:23:55.590
All plant medicines including IOWASCA.
You saw AOC tweet.
Yeah.

2408
02:23:55.620 --> 02:24:00.270
It's amazing.
But she can't get traction.
Other people in Congress.
Like what?

2409
02:24:00.690 --> 02:24:03.030
Well,
it's hard.
It's hard to sell that bill.

2410
02:24:03.031 --> 02:24:05.340
It's hard to sell psychedelic research and you know,

2411
02:24:05.341 --> 02:24:07.800
maps has been doing amazing stuff with soldiers.

2412
02:24:07.801 --> 02:24:10.500
And you've been to the actual maps conference?

2413
02:24:10.670 --> 02:24:14.960
<v 6>Yeah,
I have.
Yeah.
It was,
yeah.
It was wonderful because it's like these,
you know,</v>

2414
02:24:14.961 --> 02:24:18.890
it's,
as much as I love hanging out with you and like my friends you take

2415
02:24:18.891 --> 02:24:19.724
psychedelics,

2416
02:24:21.080 --> 02:24:26.060
it's really inspiring to be around scientists who are sort of figuring out a way

2417
02:24:26.061 --> 02:24:31.061
to translate that experience into a data set that can convince legislators to

2418
02:24:33.080 --> 02:24:36.710
change draconian laws because they're doing the hard work.
You know,
you and I,

2419
02:24:36.711 --> 02:24:41.360
we get to go on and on and on about the multiverse and the DMT entities.

2420
02:24:41.361 --> 02:24:44.180
We can make things up,
we can make things out.
They can't,

2421
02:24:44.210 --> 02:24:47.930
it doesn't matter if they've taken it and had a real experience where some

2422
02:24:47.931 --> 02:24:51.680
advanced,
uh,
whatever you want to call it is a peer to them.

2423
02:24:51.681 --> 02:24:54.680
Whether they're a part of their subconscious or an alien and said,
listen,

2424
02:24:54.830 --> 02:24:56.990
here's what's going on.
We do this with every planet.

2425
02:24:57.410 --> 02:25:02.410
The first step is we've got to like undercut the hierarchical centralized power

2426
02:25:02.421 --> 02:25:03.081
structure.

2427
02:25:03.081 --> 02:25:07.190
And we know the only way to really do that is by teaching people that their

2428
02:25:07.191 --> 02:25:09.650
identities,
they think it is isn't quite right.

2429
02:25:09.651 --> 02:25:13.460
If we can expand the human identity,
selfishness goes away.

2430
02:25:13.730 --> 02:25:18.320
If we can get rid of the problem of trauma and people dealing with trauma by

2431
02:25:18.321 --> 02:25:20.240
being aggressive to the outside world,

2432
02:25:20.510 --> 02:25:24.660
then over time the circumference of the human identity expands beyond the

2433
02:25:24.661 --> 02:25:28.350
perimeters of me and into us.
And if that happens,

2434
02:25:28.740 --> 02:25:32.490
then we can like enter into like a type a civilization or whatever they call it,

2435
02:25:32.491 --> 02:25:34.260
the beginning of a global civilization.

2436
02:25:34.261 --> 02:25:39.261
But first we've got to get the fucking monkeys to climb down from the tree of

2437
02:25:40.591 --> 02:25:43.160
them,
their selfishness,
and if we can do that and get out,

2438
02:25:43.230 --> 02:25:46.410
we can lure a few people have it themselves just like getting a buggy out of the

2439
02:25:46.411 --> 02:25:51.090
tree so that like,
uh,
people are like,
wait a minute.
I don't think I'm just,
to me,

2440
02:25:51.540 --> 02:25:56.040
I think I'm in,
I'm connected.
Everything purely interconnected.
In fact,

2441
02:25:56.400 --> 02:25:57.660
I don't think I'm anything.

2442
02:25:57.690 --> 02:26:02.220
I think what I really am is the connection between me and others.

2443
02:26:02.221 --> 02:26:04.110
That's where I exist.
Not In this,

2444
02:26:04.250 --> 02:26:07.100
<v 1>but you are something,
right?
Because you're very unique.</v>

2445
02:26:07.101 --> 02:26:10.760
Like you personally are very unique when you're one of my favorite friends.

2446
02:26:10.761 --> 02:26:14.660
But you're also one of my weirdest friends.
I'll call you always talk,
dude,

2447
02:26:14.661 --> 02:26:16.660
you got to read this book.
It's like,
dude,

2448
02:26:16.661 --> 02:26:20.870
you gotta Watch this documentary and we will talk for hours about the crazy shit

2449
02:26:20.871 --> 02:26:23.900
over.
But you are very specific.
Like you're very,

2450
02:26:23.901 --> 02:26:26.150
I don't get the same conversation with Joey Diaz.

2451
02:26:26.600 --> 02:26:29.090
I don't get the same conversation if I call Ari.
Yeah.

2452
02:26:29.180 --> 02:26:31.570
Everybody has a different thing that they're also,

2453
02:26:31.580 --> 02:26:33.950
there's something going on that's uniquely you.

2454
02:26:34.730 --> 02:26:35.300
<v 6>Oh yeah.</v>

2455
02:26:35.300 --> 02:26:39.110
I mean it to say yeah cause otherwise you sinking denialism and you're like

2456
02:26:39.111 --> 02:26:41.960
imagine the point,
right.
That's not it at all.

2457
02:26:41.961 --> 02:26:46.640
It's that you don't exist in a vacuum.
It's like that's the main thing.

2458
02:26:46.641 --> 02:26:51.641
And to me like the fundamental problem right now is selfishness.

2459
02:26:52.281 --> 02:26:55.010
It's like when you're mad at someone on the interstate,
what did they do?

2460
02:26:55.011 --> 02:26:57.830
Something selfish.
When you're mad at someone in your life,
what did they do?

2461
02:26:57.831 --> 02:27:02.270
Something selfish.
When someone's mad at you,
what did you do?
Something selfish.

2462
02:27:02.271 --> 02:27:07.271
Almost always and like this is the reality is that selfishness is an innate

2463
02:27:08.151 --> 02:27:12.740
quality of being a human.
We are a self,
there is a sense of a self rather.

2464
02:27:12.741 --> 02:27:17.000
And we feel mixed up in it.
But the,
what you realize is like,

2465
02:27:17.240 --> 02:27:20.840
you know those fucking times where you authentically not because you're filming

2466
02:27:20.841 --> 02:27:25.070
it for your Instagram or whatever,
help somebody and you don't talk about it.

2467
02:27:25.280 --> 02:27:28.040
You just suddenly do it.
Not like giving someone money either,

2468
02:27:28.041 --> 02:27:31.550
but you get engaged with a person and you're there.

2469
02:27:31.910 --> 02:27:36.910
And then it's one of my favorite mushroom trips was when I started coming back

2470
02:27:37.580 --> 02:27:41.990
and I w before I really came down,
I started thinking like,
what was I doing?

2471
02:27:42.470 --> 02:27:46.850
I was doing something.
I was being so I was being a human.

2472
02:27:47.390 --> 02:27:51.830
I was being a fuck,
oh fuck,
I'm a human.
But for a second I wasn't a meat.

2473
02:27:52.070 --> 02:27:55.250
I had merged into something bigger than me.
Similarly,

2474
02:27:55.550 --> 02:27:58.610
if you just get really engaged in helping people,

2475
02:27:58.910 --> 02:28:02.480
you'll notice that for that amount of time you don't feel quite as shitty.

2476
02:28:02.870 --> 02:28:05.900
And it's not just because you're doing something good and there's some like

2477
02:28:05.960 --> 02:28:07.850
angel casting blessings on you.

2478
02:28:08.150 --> 02:28:12.320
It's because he got out of yourself for a second in the sense that you became

2479
02:28:12.321 --> 02:28:15.560
more than just you.
You are you and the person you were helping.

2480
02:28:15.830 --> 02:28:19.610
And that to me is like a really interesting uh,

2481
02:28:19.730 --> 02:28:24.680
aspect of where we're as a species is that the reality is man,
yeah,

2482
02:28:24.681 --> 02:28:27.350
we're all special and beautiful and wonderful,

2483
02:28:27.380 --> 02:28:30.080
but also you're not happening in a vacuum.

2484
02:28:30.440 --> 02:28:35.440
You're completely inexorably interconnected with everything and you can't get

2485
02:28:36.711 --> 02:28:37.544
out of that.

2486
02:28:37.580 --> 02:28:42.020
You're in it for real and the boundaries you've constructed around you and

2487
02:28:42.021 --> 02:28:45.380
whatever you think the rest of the world is there just in your head,

2488
02:28:45.620 --> 02:28:47.330
it's not real.
You made it up.

2489
02:28:47.570 --> 02:28:51.500
You told yourself a story and you believe that story so much like the poor

2490
02:28:51.501 --> 02:28:55.250
mother fuckers are getting into like the most psychotic cults.
You know,

2491
02:28:55.251 --> 02:28:59.060
where at the end of 10 years they reveal to you some crazy,

2492
02:28:59.061 --> 02:29:00.980
crazy shit beyond crazy.

2493
02:29:01.250 --> 02:29:05.480
You spent like $900,000 in this fucking thing and they're like,
yeah,

2494
02:29:05.481 --> 02:29:10.310
we all got shit out by woolly mammoths and now you have to feel like I'm fucking

2495
02:29:10.311 --> 02:29:14.540
either believe this and dive in or I'm like,
fuck,

2496
02:29:14.541 --> 02:29:17.120
I was wrong all this time.
Similarly,

2497
02:29:17.360 --> 02:29:22.360
most people have constructed this ridiculous armoring boundary around them based

2498
02:29:23.181 --> 02:29:24.230
on,
you know,

2499
02:29:24.231 --> 02:29:29.231
this is bad and this is good and that's not good and that's good and here I am

2500
02:29:30.171 --> 02:29:33.650
in the midst of it.
And that's a real painful situation to be in cause it's,

2501
02:29:33.651 --> 02:29:38.330
you have to fucking constantly exert that force field situation.
It's really,

2502
02:29:38.780 --> 02:29:42.650
I think why so many people are depressed and exhausted and can't really relax

2503
02:29:42.920 --> 02:29:47.270
because how can you relax if you're constantly in a state of creating an

2504
02:29:47.271 --> 02:29:51.590
imaginary barrier between you and infinity called yourself.

2505
02:29:51.950 --> 02:29:56.540
It's a really exhausting probably practice to be engaged in.

2506
02:29:56.620 --> 02:29:59.920
<v 1>And then there's some people who impose themselves on other people.</v>

2507
02:29:59.960 --> 02:30:02.860
They make their life and their problems.

2508
02:30:03.370 --> 02:30:07.120
100% of the focus of this other person.
So that person becomes an enabler.

2509
02:30:07.420 --> 02:30:11.380
You see that with husbands and wives sometimes or even with friends,

2510
02:30:11.440 --> 02:30:14.560
like one person as the active asshole.

2511
02:30:14.620 --> 02:30:17.920
Then the other person is the fixer up or man Mike fucked up again.

2512
02:30:17.921 --> 02:30:18.790
I got to go get him

2513
02:30:19.760 --> 02:30:23.520
<v 6>active.
Yeah.
Asshole centralization man.</v>

2514
02:30:23.521 --> 02:30:25.140
And it's like our whole firm,

2515
02:30:25.141 --> 02:30:29.370
like our family structures usually to like the entire way we run our government

2516
02:30:29.640 --> 02:30:33.980
is usually centralized around one key identity and that we,
and you know,
we,

2517
02:30:33.981 --> 02:30:36.210
we've had this conversation many times on the show,

2518
02:30:36.211 --> 02:30:40.590
which I like the preposterous nature of a king,
of president,

2519
02:30:40.591 --> 02:30:44.460
of pope a bishop,
a world leader or a teacher,
whatever the fuck it is,

2520
02:30:44.640 --> 02:30:49.200
it's preposterous.
And uh,
it's also quite dangerous,
you know,

2521
02:30:49.201 --> 02:30:52.860
because it's like not only did we have the situation of the parasitic friend,

2522
02:30:53.190 --> 02:30:54.001
but even worse,

2523
02:30:54.001 --> 02:30:59.001
you can get into the situation of the carets Madec friend who's tricking you

2524
02:30:59.011 --> 02:31:03.360
into doing some into the idea that you could do something called cosmic

2525
02:31:03.361 --> 02:31:06.030
hitchhiking.
That's what Chogyam Trungpa calls it,

2526
02:31:06.031 --> 02:31:07.740
which is basically the idea that like,

2527
02:31:08.040 --> 02:31:13.040
I'm going to use you because you are so great and you will be the thing that

2528
02:31:13.291 --> 02:31:18.150
helps me become a real person.
It's another person.
One.
Yeah,

2529
02:31:18.151 --> 02:31:23.010
the chosen ones.
You are our teacher.
We worship you.
Oh,

2530
02:31:23.150 --> 02:31:27.660
home show is the way that I had been born.
The Dalai Lama.
So from the jump,

2531
02:31:28.200 --> 02:31:29.220
you're something special.

2532
02:31:30.480 --> 02:31:35.480
You're the chosen one and the one either reincarnation of who will this supposed

2533
02:31:35.521 --> 02:31:37.740
to be?
Are there a Toku?
That's what it's called.

2534
02:31:37.741 --> 02:31:41.880
So it's the Tohoku system and the way it would work would be,
you know,

2535
02:31:42.060 --> 02:31:44.220
cause you have to,
like,
if you look at the history of Tibet,

2536
02:31:44.520 --> 02:31:47.490
it was called the hermit kingdom and it was closed off from the rest of the

2537
02:31:47.491 --> 02:31:48.870
world.
It's very hard to get in there.

2538
02:31:49.200 --> 02:31:52.860
Seven years in Tibet is about somebody you made it through and became friends

2539
02:31:52.861 --> 02:31:57.780
with the Dalai Lama as a kid.
Um,
anyway,
so within the system,

2540
02:31:58.170 --> 02:32:01.850
uh,
there is this idea that,
uh,

2541
02:32:01.880 --> 02:32:04.770
beings reincarnate and that if you're awakened enough,

2542
02:32:04.771 --> 02:32:08.850
if you're like really like it,
the sort of last phase of this sort of,
uh,

2543
02:32:09.450 --> 02:32:12.420
what would you call it?
The cycle you were talking about earlier,

2544
02:32:12.810 --> 02:32:16.980
then you stop losing at least some of the Amnesia that happens when you get

2545
02:32:16.981 --> 02:32:21.981
processed through the liminal inbetween period called the Bardo between this

2546
02:32:21.991 --> 02:32:25.350
incarnation and the next.
So anyway,
they go to children,

2547
02:32:26.280 --> 02:32:30.480
they put in front of them the,
uh,
particular,
uh,

2548
02:32:30.840 --> 02:32:34.230
items that belonged to the previous incarnation that they think they are

2549
02:32:34.380 --> 02:32:39.380
Oracle's vision visionaries bring the monks to a particular village and then the

2550
02:32:39.631 --> 02:32:43.890
kid picks it and then that big kid becomes the next,
this or that.

2551
02:32:44.010 --> 02:32:48.600
It's called a Tokyo.
How many kids?
They looked at a,
I don't know man.

2552
02:32:48.601 --> 02:32:51.090
I don't know the depths of it get turns out to be an asshole.

2553
02:32:51.510 --> 02:32:53.340
I take his powers away.
Well,

2554
02:32:53.370 --> 02:32:56.730
I think it has happened where told boozer like it's similar to like a,

2555
02:32:57.060 --> 02:32:58.230
what the fuck is the,

2556
02:32:58.710 --> 02:33:02.940
what is the thing where those kids get one summer to go?

2557
02:33:02.941 --> 02:33:06.660
Like the summer of fucking,
what does that really show?
Yeah,
that's almost,

2558
02:33:06.661 --> 02:33:10.980
that's a rumples bring a rub sprayer.
Yeah.
Rover.

2559
02:33:11.040 --> 02:33:15.390
I'm sorry,
what does that,
there's a great documentary on that.
Yeah,

2560
02:33:15.420 --> 02:33:20.160
something,
the devil's something.
The devil.

2561
02:33:20.161 --> 02:33:22.950
So it's like a great name,
the devil summer,

2562
02:33:23.160 --> 02:33:26.130
but it's just like the devil's playground.

2563
02:33:26.670 --> 02:33:30.870
[inaudible]
fuck.
And the smoke.

2564
02:33:30.871 --> 02:33:33.720
And then a lot of them come back.
Well,
what feel empty?

2565
02:33:33.960 --> 02:33:38.640
I believe that was one of the ways they studied the impact of Mtma wasn't it by

2566
02:33:38.641 --> 02:33:39.780
like cause like these,

2567
02:33:39.870 --> 02:33:43.800
like if you find someone who's taken Mtma but no other drug,
it's pretty rare.

2568
02:33:44.070 --> 02:33:49.070
So you need to find a person who's only taken MTMA otherwise he can't acts like

2569
02:33:49.920 --> 02:33:53.100
assess that there's some cognitive damage.
Cause it could've been the acid,

2570
02:33:53.101 --> 02:33:54.300
it could have been the mushrooms,

2571
02:33:54.600 --> 02:33:57.570
it could've been the time you fell on your ass when you were hammered.

2572
02:33:57.660 --> 02:33:59.610
Who the fuck knows?
But these kids,

2573
02:33:59.611 --> 02:34:03.930
some of them have only taken MTMA and so I believe that they use them as a

2574
02:34:03.931 --> 02:34:08.280
sample to like determine if there was any kind of neurological damage caused by

2575
02:34:08.640 --> 02:34:09.990
the drug itself.

2576
02:34:09.991 --> 02:34:14.280
But so I think it's similar phenomena happens within that system where some kids

2577
02:34:14.281 --> 02:34:18.020
are like,
I'm not a reincarnated beating,
I'm a musician.
I want to go play

2578
02:34:18.020 --> 02:34:19.160
<v 1>music.
And they leave.</v>

2579
02:34:19.250 --> 02:34:23.270
Do you know who's a musician who's also reincarnated being Jimi Hendrix?

2580
02:34:23.271 --> 02:34:28.130
Steven Seagal?
What?
Yup.
When did that happen?
I didn't know that.
Told them.

2581
02:34:28.131 --> 02:34:30.710
I think the Dalai Lama might've hooked him up,
told them.

2582
02:34:30.711 --> 02:34:33.050
I'm like one of those guys over there and told them that he was the

2583
02:34:33.051 --> 02:34:37.100
reincarnation of a,
someone's super special.
Jesus.
God,

2584
02:34:37.130 --> 02:34:41.120
it's a big deal over there.
Well then they had a ceremony and everything.

2585
02:34:41.530 --> 02:34:45.770
Oh it is from 1997 this is the long written thing and bio about it.
Oh,

2586
02:34:45.771 --> 02:34:48.040
that's a lot of words.
I know that's going to breed that.

2587
02:34:48.520 --> 02:34:53.520
The recognition of Steven Seagal as a reincarnation of the treasure revealer

2588
02:34:54.140 --> 02:34:58.400
Chung drag door Jay.
Wow.

2589
02:34:58.570 --> 02:35:02.870
Of that sale pile.
You'll monastery.
Yeah.

2590
02:35:03.200 --> 02:35:04.260
So He's a reincarnation.

2591
02:35:04.330 --> 02:35:06.910
<v 6>Well that's comforting to know.
He's always been with us,
you know,</v>

2592
02:35:06.911 --> 02:35:10.210
cause it's like one of the things that does bother me is to imagine a world

2593
02:35:10.211 --> 02:35:13.210
without Seagal,
you know?
So it's cool to know he's always been here,

2594
02:35:13.211 --> 02:35:17.680
coming back again and again.
How come nobody was ever a loser in a past life?
Oh,

2595
02:35:17.740 --> 02:35:22.030
but he was always a fucking nope.
Awesome.
Oh,
you mean,
oh right.
Yeah.

2596
02:35:22.031 --> 02:35:25.130
When I went a little full of shit people.
Yeah,
of course.

2597
02:35:25.150 --> 02:35:27.380
Like what are you going to be like 30 you know what?

2598
02:35:27.490 --> 02:35:30.700
If you're making money as a fucking psychic and you're like,
Whoa,

2599
02:35:30.701 --> 02:35:35.230
you are basically like a gutter rat.
You are,
you've only been a rat.

2600
02:35:35.260 --> 02:35:39.070
You can filth.
You weren't even,
you are a mucus thing.

2601
02:35:39.071 --> 02:35:42.070
Like I'm not sure what you call it,
a kind of jellyfish that killed babies.

2602
02:35:42.610 --> 02:35:43.690
You're a tapeworm,

2603
02:35:43.700 --> 02:35:46.510
you're one of those long worms that went into someone's brain and sure

2604
02:35:46.560 --> 02:35:51.440
<v 1>stenosis motherfucker,
you're uncooked pork.
You are a math.
You are.
Yeah.
Yeah.</v>

2605
02:35:51.450 --> 02:35:55.410
The whole like to me like the whole reincarnation is a toll.
Cool.
Yeah.

2606
02:35:55.710 --> 02:35:59.220
I told you it's a statement from the guy.
I'm recognized.
My students,

2607
02:35:59.221 --> 02:36:04.221
Steven Seagal as a reincarnation Toku of the treasure revealer Chung drag door.

2608
02:36:05.131 --> 02:36:07.950
Jay,
this has been some confusion.
Uncertainty as to what this means.

2609
02:36:08.220 --> 02:36:09.980
I'm writing to clarify the situation.

2610
02:36:10.040 --> 02:36:12.890
<v 6>No clarifying necessary.
I'll see you later man.
I gotta go.</v>

2611
02:36:13.430 --> 02:36:14.420
<v 1>I might be full of Shit.</v>

2612
02:36:14.850 --> 02:36:19.850
You are galls got five hookers going to this guy's house right now as we speak.

2613
02:36:21.150 --> 02:36:22.900
<v 6>Well also the other there,</v>

2614
02:36:23.110 --> 02:36:26.850
so there's talk of like ending the Tohoku system and um,

2615
02:36:27.270 --> 02:36:31.560
the Dalai Lama has even said that.
And,
uh,
recognizing that cause what's cool,

2616
02:36:31.610 --> 02:36:36.030
it's all right.
Well I'm,
uh,
among many things is that he said,
you know,

2617
02:36:36.060 --> 02:36:37.920
if sa he's very rational and he said,

2618
02:36:37.921 --> 02:36:40.860
if science proves something in Buddhism is off,

2619
02:36:40.861 --> 02:36:44.220
we'll change Buddhism to fit the rational mind.

2620
02:36:44.221 --> 02:36:48.300
And that's the beauty of Buddhism.
There's pageantry in it,
there's ceremony,

2621
02:36:48.301 --> 02:36:52.530
there's ritual in it.
Just like any other religion.
It's beautiful.
Personally,

2622
02:36:52.531 --> 02:36:55.650
I think that there is a sort of,
uh,

2623
02:36:56.250 --> 02:36:58.290
area of,
uh,

2624
02:36:58.291 --> 02:37:02.760
experience accessible through their practices that I guess could best be

2625
02:37:02.761 --> 02:37:06.240
compared to psychedelics or something like that.
But,
uh,

2626
02:37:06.900 --> 02:37:11.900
to me what I love about it is all the pageantry aside and all of it aside.

2627
02:37:12.990 --> 02:37:16.040
It's not faith based.
It's a very basic

2628
02:37:16.670 --> 02:37:21.230
<v 2>series of ideas that you have to digest.
You have to think about,</v>

2629
02:37:21.231 --> 02:37:25.640
you have to look into,
you don't just get to be it.
It's like,
you know,

2630
02:37:25.641 --> 02:37:28.250
maybe some forms of it.
There could be an example of that.

2631
02:37:28.251 --> 02:37:33.110
But in general it's more along the lines of here's the basic fundamental

2632
02:37:33.230 --> 02:37:38.230
principles behind this not and the co and the cording of a human life than we've

2633
02:37:39.951 --> 02:37:44.120
discovered.
Here's where some sufferings coming from all the suffering in fact,

2634
02:37:44.390 --> 02:37:45.620
and here's how to fix it.

2635
02:37:45.950 --> 02:37:49.820
That's the four noble truths of Buddhism and that just hearing it,

2636
02:37:49.821 --> 02:37:53.030
who gives a fuck?
You could here,
life is suffering.

2637
02:37:53.031 --> 02:37:56.810
The cause of suffering is attachment.
Get rid of attachment.
Suffering ends.

2638
02:37:57.050 --> 02:38:00.560
Here's the system to get rid of attachment and you know,

2639
02:38:00.590 --> 02:38:04.280
whatever life is suffering was I even fucking mean.
What does life of even mean?

2640
02:38:04.490 --> 02:38:08.060
What does it even mean by suffering this,
this first noble truth,

2641
02:38:08.120 --> 02:38:12.920
it gets completely miss translated anyway,
Duca,
it means wobbly wheel.

2642
02:38:13.100 --> 02:38:18.100
It's more akin to like if you're riding a bike that's got not enough air in it,

2643
02:38:19.550 --> 02:38:23.750
it's going to be a rough ride,
but it's going to be even more of a rough ride.

2644
02:38:24.050 --> 02:38:25.360
If you have some out,

2645
02:38:25.361 --> 02:38:29.450
trick yourself into thinking there's enough air in the tire so that anytime you

2646
02:38:29.451 --> 02:38:33.920
hit some bumps you're like,
what the fuck is wrong with you?
What I mean,

2647
02:38:34.100 --> 02:38:38.000
that's it.
That's it.
It's like wobbly wheel.
The things wonky.

2648
02:38:38.001 --> 02:38:40.790
You think you're not going to get this connected when you've been on the line

2649
02:38:41.060 --> 02:38:45.680
with Verizon for an hour,
you're going to get disconnected.
It tends to happen.

2650
02:38:45.860 --> 02:38:48.260
You're going to get cut off in traffic,
you're gonna fail.

2651
02:38:48.261 --> 02:38:50.900
You're going to be disappointed.
This is reality.

2652
02:38:51.110 --> 02:38:55.520
But somehow you've imagined that it doesn't work like that.

2653
02:38:55.790 --> 02:38:59.660
And every single time you're met with the truth,
you're like,
ah,

2654
02:39:00.200 --> 02:39:02.450
Oh God,
this sucks.
And you know,
so that's gonna.

2655
02:39:02.490 --> 02:39:07.490
That creates a lot of problems and it creates to some ways to deal with it,

2656
02:39:08.510 --> 02:39:10.010
which is desire and aversion.

2657
02:39:10.370 --> 02:39:14.090
So you're somewhere and you want to be somewhere else,
basically.
You know,
you're,

2658
02:39:14.320 --> 02:39:17.930
you're somewhere and you're like,
I don't want to be in this place.
Or you know,

2659
02:39:17.931 --> 02:39:20.480
you're imagining that if you get this thing or that thing,

2660
02:39:20.780 --> 02:39:24.140
the pain you're feeling is of the wobbly wheel will go away.

2661
02:39:25.220 --> 02:39:28.430
Do the experiment,
see if it's true.
See if it's true.

2662
02:39:28.431 --> 02:39:32.420
That's all you can do is like really look at the shit that you want.

2663
02:39:32.480 --> 02:39:35.120
Like I could come home and mow,

2664
02:39:35.121 --> 02:39:38.750
could pulled up and given me seven mogue ones.
Right?

2665
02:39:38.810 --> 02:39:42.620
And I'm going to sit and play those fucking mogue ones for weeks and weeks until

2666
02:39:42.621 --> 02:39:47.621
I'm sweaty and smell like fucking just someone shoved a Salami under the balls

2667
02:39:48.021 --> 02:39:52.950
of an ape.
You know,
I'm not going to take showers
using it.

2668
02:39:52.951 --> 02:39:57.440
Stink in like probably weeping into the mug and sneezing into it.

2669
02:39:57.650 --> 02:40:02.120
Anyway,
the point is eventually after I saw the distraction has gone away,

2670
02:40:02.720 --> 02:40:05.590
I'm going to return to my fundamental self.
You know,
Eh,

2671
02:40:05.640 --> 02:40:09.950
the fundamental condition of existence as it is regardless.

2672
02:40:10.070 --> 02:40:14.070
And so this is sort of the print,
some of the principles,
I understand it,

2673
02:40:14.100 --> 02:40:16.830
<v 6>which you're really quite intelligent,
you know,
it's really,
and,</v>

2674
02:40:16.850 --> 02:40:20.700
and what I love about it most of all is there's always this invitation,

2675
02:40:20.701 --> 02:40:25.410
which is go see,
go see.
It's not because I'm telling you this,

2676
02:40:25.411 --> 02:40:29.820
believe it,
right?
It's like go see,
maybe it's different for you and,
and,

2677
02:40:29.850 --> 02:40:30.960
but you need to go check.

2678
02:40:30.961 --> 02:40:34.440
Like every time you're doing the thing that you've been repeating over and over

2679
02:40:34.441 --> 02:40:38.580
again,
is it making you happy for real?
Is it really working?

2680
02:40:38.820 --> 02:40:41.250
Is it working?
And if it's working,
great,

2681
02:40:41.940 --> 02:40:45.570
but if it's not and you're trying to pretend it is because you've been doing it

2682
02:40:45.571 --> 02:40:48.420
so long,
well who are you?

2683
02:40:48.810 --> 02:40:53.760
Who's winning this game of self deception?
What?
What,
what?
There's no winning.

2684
02:40:53.761 --> 02:40:58.620
If the game is tricking yourself,
you can only what and what do you do?

2685
02:40:58.621 --> 02:41:02.370
Like how do you feel about life if you're always tricking yourself?

2686
02:41:02.670 --> 02:41:06.750
Hey Twitter world.
Yeah man,
that's right.

2687
02:41:07.230 --> 02:41:11.970
You will only feel that the everyone is trying to trick you and you'll feel like

2688
02:41:11.971 --> 02:41:15.600
there's a grand conspiracy and you'll feel like the world's out to get you and

2689
02:41:15.601 --> 02:41:17.000
there is a greater good gets seat,

2690
02:41:17.040 --> 02:41:20.280
which is that you are running a game on yourself.

2691
02:41:21.530 --> 02:41:24.860
Yeah.
I feel like we should end with that.
Yeah.
I

2692
02:41:24.860 --> 02:41:27.790
<v 1>fell like that's very important for people to hear.
Yeah,</v>

2693
02:41:27.791 --> 02:41:29.710
I true and thinking resonates with all of us.

2694
02:41:29.770 --> 02:41:33.340
We've all done that at the lowest points of consciousness in your life.

2695
02:41:33.580 --> 02:41:37.150
He run a little trick on yourself or to get past things work,
you know?

2696
02:41:37.420 --> 02:41:41.560
And I think in some of that trick is run because you don't totally understand

2697
02:41:41.561 --> 02:41:45.340
who you are.
And you want to,
maybe I'm this guy,
maybe I'm,

2698
02:41:45.640 --> 02:41:49.120
maybe I'm a hardcore Republican.
Hey,
you know what?
Those fucking Democrats,

2699
02:41:49.121 --> 02:41:52.840
they tricked me for far too long.
I'm over here now.
Yeah.
I found my home,

2700
02:41:52.990 --> 02:41:55.690
found my home over here,
and that's one of the things that people do.

2701
02:41:55.930 --> 02:41:58.870
They really do.
They hop from it.
I used to be a Vegan,

2702
02:41:58.871 --> 02:42:02.710
but now I'm a fucking corner.
This time I just see all stakes.

2703
02:42:02.711 --> 02:42:04.990
Ribeye steaks all day long.
You know what?

2704
02:42:05.140 --> 02:42:08.350
I couldn't believe what a pussy I was when I was just eating vegetables.

2705
02:42:08.740 --> 02:42:12.640
Congrats.
That's a lot of it,
right?
Yeah,
man.
And it's,

2706
02:42:13.260 --> 02:42:17.260
and it's almost exactly like what we were talking about with religions that you

2707
02:42:17.261 --> 02:42:18.280
looked down these grids,

2708
02:42:18.310 --> 02:42:21.670
these grids are run by different operating systems that require different

2709
02:42:21.671 --> 02:42:25.030
behavior from their women.
This operating system,
you can't drive.

2710
02:42:25.360 --> 02:42:28.210
You gotta dress like a beekeeper and you have to do this and you have to do
that.

2711
02:42:28.211 --> 02:42:31.060
This operating system,
you put a plate through your lip and yeah,

2712
02:42:31.061 --> 02:42:33.880
you got a bone in your nose and this and this operating system,

2713
02:42:34.130 --> 02:42:37.360
everybody gets face tattoos.
And this operating system,
you know,

2714
02:42:37.361 --> 02:42:39.960
and no one needs peak,
uh,
pork.
It's another,

2715
02:42:39.970 --> 02:42:42.670
Oh God does not want in our operating system.

2716
02:42:44.200 --> 02:42:49.200
You get the same thing I think with right and left with Vegan and eater with a

2717
02:42:52.630 --> 02:42:55.090
pick your poison,
like whatever the fuck it is.
Yeah,

2718
02:42:55.120 --> 02:42:58.750
whatever thing it is that you're into.

2719
02:42:59.110 --> 02:43:02.960
Especially ideological,
especially lifestyle based,
there's always a,

2720
02:43:02.961 --> 02:43:04.240
an opposing one,

2721
02:43:04.390 --> 02:43:07.420
like the people that don't want people to be gay or the people that even a lot

2722
02:43:07.421 --> 02:43:09.880
of the abortion stuff,
a lot of the abortion stuff,

2723
02:43:09.881 --> 02:43:14.881
it's like how of it is how much of this really well thought out behavior and how

2724
02:43:15.931 --> 02:43:19.950
much of it is,
how does your tribe respond to this?

2725
02:43:20.130 --> 02:43:21.420
And one of the ways you can tell,

2726
02:43:21.690 --> 02:43:25.920
especially if you're talking to a hardcore lefty or a Republican for that
matter,

2727
02:43:25.921 --> 02:43:26.970
we can offer two examples,

2728
02:43:27.180 --> 02:43:30.750
but one of the ways he could tell his hard core lefties do not like to discuss

2729
02:43:30.751 --> 02:43:34.890
late term abortion.
He said,
well what if it's a fetus?
What if it's a baby?

2730
02:43:34.891 --> 02:43:35.161
What if,

2731
02:43:35.161 --> 02:43:38.130
what if we're talking like eight months in and it's a woman's right to choose.

2732
02:43:38.160 --> 02:43:38.993
It's a women's right?
No,
it's,

2733
02:43:39.090 --> 02:43:43.260
it's a baby in this person's body like when is it a baby?
Look,

2734
02:43:43.261 --> 02:43:45.720
I'm a hundred percent pro women's right to choose.

2735
02:43:46.170 --> 02:43:47.340
I'm a hundred percent pro choice,

2736
02:43:47.820 --> 02:43:52.560
but late term abortions are fucking weird.
It's dark.

2737
02:43:52.561 --> 02:43:55.860
It's strange and everybody knows that.
Everybody knows that.

2738
02:43:55.980 --> 02:43:59.160
But if you're a hardcore lefty,
you won't say it.
And then the hardcore righties,

2739
02:43:59.670 --> 02:44:03.570
what if you were raped?
What if you're,
what if you're a little girl,

2740
02:44:03.630 --> 02:44:05.170
a 13 year old girl,
she was raped.

2741
02:44:05.171 --> 02:44:08.310
Do you want that girl to carry your fucking baby?
Are you crazy?

2742
02:44:09.060 --> 02:44:11.460
She was raped four weeks ago.
We found out she's pregnant.

2743
02:44:11.640 --> 02:44:15.630
What do you want me to do?
You want me to pray?
How about fuck you right?

2744
02:44:15.710 --> 02:44:19.020
How about fuck you might raped little girl is not going to have to carry

2745
02:44:19.021 --> 02:44:21.220
someone's baby fucking Asshole,
right?

2746
02:44:21.650 --> 02:44:25.320
The idea that your invisible man in the sky that watches over everything you do

2747
02:44:25.321 --> 02:44:29.370
but allows rape to occur,
allows little kids to get raped.

2748
02:44:29.460 --> 02:44:32.730
You want that little kid to carry a baby,
I'll fucking kill you.
Right?

2749
02:44:32.800 --> 02:44:36.180
Your goddamn crazy.
Right?
There's people that feel like that too.

2750
02:44:36.370 --> 02:44:39.820
<v 6>Well,
this is,
if you want to find the column commonality,
the common thread.</v>

2751
02:44:39.821 --> 02:44:41.290
It's just the way you were describing,

2752
02:44:41.291 --> 02:44:44.830
which is a natural reaction to someone saying that to you are controlling your

2753
02:44:44.831 --> 02:44:49.030
life in that way.
It's aggression.
So like on both sides.
Yeah.

2754
02:44:49.060 --> 02:44:51.640
It's not that there's an articulation of a point of view.

2755
02:44:51.910 --> 02:44:55.720
It's at the point of view is being flavored with anger.
With aggression.
Yes.

2756
02:44:55.960 --> 02:44:59.770
Pushing,
pushing,
pushing.
It's a woman's right to choose.
Yeah.
And it's,

2757
02:44:59.780 --> 02:45:04.120
or it's not,
or whatever.
Both sides have with them.
A quality of aggression.
Yep.

2758
02:45:04.360 --> 02:45:08.710
So this is like,
this is,
you know,
not to over simplify things.

2759
02:45:08.980 --> 02:45:11.620
The reality is,
man,
we won.
We got to cut ourselves a break.

2760
02:45:11.830 --> 02:45:15.310
And you know this and you've articulated as better than anybody.
We weren't.

2761
02:45:15.610 --> 02:45:19.660
We were monkeys not that long ago.
Really recent.
Go look at monkeys,

2762
02:45:19.810 --> 02:45:24.490
see how they act.
Crazy.
Right?
So give number one,
give yourself a fucking break.

2763
02:45:24.760 --> 02:45:28.150
You and the evolutionary,
like from the evolutionary perspective,

2764
02:45:28.420 --> 02:45:32.620
you're just barely waking up.
But because you've been a monkey inside of you,

2765
02:45:32.621 --> 02:45:34.150
there's some serious,

2766
02:45:34.330 --> 02:45:39.330
serious aggression because that was the way to deal with the eagle that was

2767
02:45:39.880 --> 02:45:43.510
bigger than you,
that carried your wife away to feed doings and chicks.

2768
02:45:43.810 --> 02:45:48.220
You weren't going to fucking have a sit down with the Eagle and be like,
listen,

2769
02:45:48.490 --> 02:45:53.380
I know you need to live.
And my wife,
I imagined she was delicious.
We've,

2770
02:45:53.381 --> 02:45:54.214
I've been,
you know,

2771
02:45:54.250 --> 02:45:58.780
farming for the last several years and feeding her every day and you know,

2772
02:45:58.781 --> 02:46:01.660
the baby's going to die because he was drinking your milk and all legal.

2773
02:46:01.661 --> 02:46:05.110
But listen,
I wonder if maybe you could just spare the rest of my family.

2774
02:46:05.280 --> 02:46:08.410
What are you're going to do is kill that fucking eagle anyway,

2775
02:46:08.411 --> 02:46:10.280
you can fire spears,

2776
02:46:10.280 --> 02:46:13.910
<v 2>whatever.
So now to think that that has gone away,</v>

2777
02:46:14.150 --> 02:46:19.070
it's very similar to a person who takes a vacation and suddenly realizes I can't

2778
02:46:19.071 --> 02:46:22.730
relax,
will you can't relax.
Because for the last fucking year,

2779
02:46:22.880 --> 02:46:27.560
you've been going nonstop in a state of constant stress,
freaking out.

2780
02:46:27.650 --> 02:46:30.650
You're on vacation.
You think that momentum is going to go away?
No,

2781
02:46:30.651 --> 02:46:32.920
it's just going to be more apparent.
So you're going to like,
wow,

2782
02:46:33.020 --> 02:46:35.120
I've got guzzle it down and try to fuck it away.

2783
02:46:35.121 --> 02:46:39.020
But then you're on the airplane hung over and it's like,
you know what I mean?

2784
02:46:39.021 --> 02:46:41.300
You're all fucking over.
And it's like,

2785
02:46:41.301 --> 02:46:43.370
what happened though was vacation is already over.

2786
02:46:43.700 --> 02:46:48.140
That's what has happened to us,
which is like,
listen,
we've got a good right now.

2787
02:46:48.350 --> 02:46:51.650
But it wasn't that long ago that saber tooth tigers were dragging our children

2788
02:46:51.651 --> 02:46:53.210
to the fucking jungle and eating them.

2789
02:46:53.210 --> 02:46:57.110
And we find sh feet that were our kids' feet in a Bush somewhere.

2790
02:46:57.380 --> 02:47:00.620
And this traumas in US epigenetically.
So anyway,
the point is,

2791
02:47:00.860 --> 02:47:02.060
give yourself a fucking break.

2792
02:47:02.360 --> 02:47:05.930
But the other point is that being said,

2793
02:47:06.220 --> 02:47:08.780
we recognize you're being aggressive.

2794
02:47:08.990 --> 02:47:13.310
You're approach using anger and intolerance,

2795
02:47:13.610 --> 02:47:15.320
uh,
is not working.

2796
02:47:15.690 --> 02:47:18.710
It's money as noble as your purpose may be.

2797
02:47:19.400 --> 02:47:23.000
You want a global civilization of joy.
Whatever the fuck it is,

2798
02:47:24.020 --> 02:47:25.460
it's not working.

2799
02:47:25.490 --> 02:47:30.490
If you're using the exact same momentum that causes the wars that you're hoping

2800
02:47:30.951 --> 02:47:31.784
to stop.

2801
02:47:31.970 --> 02:47:36.970
So the first step has to be I think an internal personal exploration to create

2802
02:47:39.261 --> 02:47:41.200
some,
not to even get rid of the aggression.

2803
02:47:41.210 --> 02:47:43.880
It'd be like I'm bad because I'm angry or I'm all that bullshit.

2804
02:47:44.270 --> 02:47:48.170
But to create some,
to find out what is the circumference of the self.

2805
02:47:48.380 --> 02:47:51.140
And then within that you realize the thing you thought was all of you that

2806
02:47:51.141 --> 02:47:55.790
coiled up fucking anger is in fact a tiny piece of you.

2807
02:47:55.850 --> 02:47:59.930
It's still there and it's still useful at times,
but it's not all of you.

2808
02:48:00.200 --> 02:48:04.820
And because the circumference is widened the next time the angry part of you

2809
02:48:04.821 --> 02:48:07.130
starts bubbling.
It's just like,

2810
02:48:07.340 --> 02:48:10.550
it's the difference between somebody throwing a brick and a bathtub and a brick

2811
02:48:10.551 --> 02:48:14.870
in the ocean.
It's like a brick in the ocean.
No big deal.
A brick in the bathtub.

2812
02:48:14.900 --> 02:48:19.110
Fuck you dude,
Chris and my best fits you the fuck out.

2813
02:48:20.610 --> 02:48:21.300
So that's,

2814
02:48:21.300 --> 02:48:26.300
that's the idea is like we're not trying to annihilate the self or our say this,

2815
02:48:26.751 --> 02:48:29.000
this person,
this human being you are,

2816
02:48:29.001 --> 02:48:31.100
it's irrelevant or it's not worth this or that.

2817
02:48:31.370 --> 02:48:34.340
It's just what is the circumference of your identity.

2818
02:48:34.630 --> 02:48:37.490
And that's the exploration I think that gets,

2819
02:48:37.610 --> 02:48:40.910
that Buddhism invites people to do or any religion that is real and good.

2820
02:48:41.180 --> 02:48:43.100
It's inviting people like find out what you are.

2821
02:48:43.460 --> 02:48:46.190
And then as a natural byproduct of that exploration,

2822
02:48:46.460 --> 02:48:50.930
you become a little more gentle.
And because you're gentle,
you're more effective.

2823
02:48:50.960 --> 02:48:52.160
That's where it gets really weird.

2824
02:48:52.520 --> 02:48:56.570
Gentleness seems to be quite often the,

2825
02:48:56.900 --> 02:48:58.310
what was my friend saying?
He's like,
you know,

2826
02:48:58.311 --> 02:49:01.250
if my dogs are outside and I'm like,
get the fuck,
I thought fuck it.
House,

2827
02:49:01.640 --> 02:49:04.730
they're not coming in.
But if I'm like,
come on,
come on,

2828
02:49:04.731 --> 02:49:07.550
I love you and you really mean it.
They come running into house.
Yeah.

2829
02:49:07.920 --> 02:49:11.430
So this is the thing is like it,
the aggression stuff,
it worked man.

2830
02:49:11.431 --> 02:49:14.730
Cause of the eagles and the Tigers and all that shit.
But you know what I mean?

2831
02:49:14.731 --> 02:49:15.810
Now maybe there's a new way.

2832
02:49:16.050 --> 02:49:17.420
<v 1>Yeah.
And we're stuck.</v>

2833
02:49:17.510 --> 02:49:21.730
We're stuck with the DNA that sort of goes through how to survive.
Yeah.

2834
02:49:21.760 --> 02:49:24.650
Rules and the Tigers that we needed it.
Yeah.
We needed it

2835
02:49:25.490 --> 02:49:29.090
<v 2>bit,
you know,
don't like,
or a violet or something like,
in fact,</v>

2836
02:49:29.230 --> 02:49:29.980
<v 1>love it.</v>

2837
02:49:29.980 --> 02:49:34.980
I think that's part of the appeal of the Dad bod part of the appeal of like,

2838
02:49:36.220 --> 02:49:39.670
you know,
someone talking about unrealistic body expectations.

2839
02:49:39.760 --> 02:49:44.760
You're really talking about like less reliance on the,

2840
02:49:45.070 --> 02:49:49.360
the flesh,
the,
the,
the,
the virility,

2841
02:49:49.600 --> 02:49:54.490
the athletic ability,
the ability to conquer,
you know,

2842
02:49:54.491 --> 02:49:55.450
the ability to,

2843
02:49:55.451 --> 02:49:59.950
to breed and spread your genes and fight off predators and enemies and invaders.

2844
02:50:00.160 --> 02:50:04.380
It's not nearly as necessary as it used to be,
but necessary but necessary.
And,

2845
02:50:04.420 --> 02:50:08.680
but the people who are not capable of it despise it because they think it's the

2846
02:50:08.681 --> 02:50:12.920
problem.
They think the ability to conquer is the problem.
Yeah,

2847
02:50:13.490 --> 02:50:16.410
the strong.
And if everyone was weak,

2848
02:50:16.570 --> 02:50:20.890
it's essentially the argument for socialism,
you know?
Oh,
you don't have it.

2849
02:50:21.220 --> 02:50:23.230
If you don't have it and you see other people have it.

2850
02:50:23.231 --> 02:50:25.270
Like I only anybody should have it.
How about that?

2851
02:50:26.130 --> 02:50:30.750
<v 2>Oh yeah.
And it's also part of it.
I mean,
people have encountered,</v>

2852
02:50:31.170 --> 02:50:31.641
the thing is,

2853
02:50:31.641 --> 02:50:35.580
is like take a person who has some chip on their shoulder about dudes with

2854
02:50:35.581 --> 02:50:39.970
muscles.
Right?
If you look at it,
that didn't happen by itself.
They didn't,

2855
02:50:39.971 --> 02:50:42.600
weren't,
didn't wake up one day and like I fucking hate biceps.

2856
02:50:42.780 --> 02:50:47.780
What happened is like people with muscles who were traditionally like ideally

2857
02:50:48.781 --> 02:50:52.740
war like meant to be warriors and protectors in a noble way.

2858
02:50:53.580 --> 02:50:57.090
They've gotten really aggressive like you see and it's not all of them,

2859
02:50:57.091 --> 02:51:01.650
but how many videos have popped up,
have,
you know,
a police officer,

2860
02:51:01.680 --> 02:51:05.520
I'll blow your fucking head off,
get the fuck.
Cause the kid took a doll,

2861
02:51:05.550 --> 02:51:09.750
you know that video we were talking about?
Yes.
So it's like,
so,
so similarly,

2862
02:51:09.751 --> 02:51:14.751
like sometimes what's coinciding with the muscular thing is also a dominant

2863
02:51:16.321 --> 02:51:21.030
aggressive attitude to the two have become mixed together.
The conflate them.
Yes.

2864
02:51:21.031 --> 02:51:22.480
And it's theirs.
They're there.

2865
02:51:22.500 --> 02:51:24.630
If you've ever been around people who are real fighters,

2866
02:51:24.870 --> 02:51:28.440
usually they're like the most gentle people you've ever met.
Super Nice people.

2867
02:51:28.470 --> 02:51:32.880
And it's unnerving because you know,
like Eddie Bravo,
he's a nice man.

2868
02:51:32.881 --> 02:51:37.260
You when I'm around him,
like I forget that I could just suddenly be dead.

2869
02:51:38.370 --> 02:51:40.230
You know that.
I mean if you didn't forget it,

2870
02:51:40.231 --> 02:51:42.060
you'd be nervous around him all the time.
Like,
you know,

2871
02:51:42.061 --> 02:51:45.540
you're in a great conversation with them and join his company and then like you

2872
02:51:45.541 --> 02:51:50.490
could just,
that's it.
So similarly like,
uh,
uh,
this is what happened.

2873
02:51:50.491 --> 02:51:51.480
That,
so the idea is like,

2874
02:51:51.510 --> 02:51:56.510
you've got a continuum of possible ways that humans express themselves.

2875
02:51:56.701 --> 02:51:59.760
On one side,
you have the condition of the noble warrior,

2876
02:51:59.761 --> 02:52:04.350
which is a train discipline person who's literally putting themselves in front

2877
02:52:04.351 --> 02:52:07.090
of others.
The Samurai,
you talk about it a bunch,
you know,

2878
02:52:07.240 --> 02:52:08.710
who's fading into the background,

2879
02:52:08.890 --> 02:52:13.240
who doesn't even give a fuck if anybody knows I did anything heroic because

2880
02:52:13.241 --> 02:52:15.940
they've given up on that.
It's a very spiritual way of being.

2881
02:52:15.960 --> 02:52:18.330
<v 1>Well then there's also the concern about the warmonger,</v>

2882
02:52:18.331 --> 02:52:19.950
like why does the warmonger exists?

2883
02:52:19.980 --> 02:52:23.130
Is the warmonger like the firefighter that starts their own fires.

2884
02:52:23.670 --> 02:52:25.860
I a lot of the times,
yes,
they live for that.

2885
02:52:25.900 --> 02:52:28.350
They live for that experience because that's what they desire.

2886
02:52:28.440 --> 02:52:33.330
<v 2>Yeah.
Yeah.
If you,
if you,
if you want to sell umbrellas,
you need it to rain.
Yeah,</v>

2887
02:52:33.360 --> 02:52:37.160
yeah.
Well,
yeah.
But this is again,
corruption of,
uh,
of,
of,

2888
02:52:37.161 --> 02:52:39.810
of a potential ideal,
which is like,

2889
02:52:40.020 --> 02:52:44.940
regardless of the fact that we've all kind of like witnessed various examples in

2890
02:52:44.941 --> 02:52:49.941
pretty much every profession of what it looks like when things aren't so great

2891
02:52:50.430 --> 02:52:55.140
and imbalanced.
There's also examples of people who are the opposite of that,

2892
02:52:55.141 --> 02:53:00.120
who are like completely,
you know,
in service who like,

2893
02:53:00.121 --> 02:53:04.770
you know,
how many firemen got fucking incinerated in September 11th man,

2894
02:53:05.010 --> 02:53:09.300
you know,
and the truth is,
I can't name,
unfortunately,
embarrassingly enough,

2895
02:53:09.301 --> 02:53:11.040
I couldn't name one of them if you pay me too.

2896
02:53:11.370 --> 02:53:13.830
These are people who literally gave their entire life up,

2897
02:53:13.980 --> 02:53:17.280
who went up that fucking thing.
They didn't think they were coming back down.

2898
02:53:17.430 --> 02:53:19.860
There are firemen.
They looked at that and they were probably like,
yeah,

2899
02:53:19.861 --> 02:53:23.130
I'm going to die.
I Bet I died today.
But they're like,
if I don't do it,

2900
02:53:23.131 --> 02:53:24.810
well no one does it.

2901
02:53:24.870 --> 02:53:29.280
So that's an example of how good it can be and why we need it and what it can

2902
02:53:29.281 --> 02:53:32.010
really be.
That's a sacred way to be.

2903
02:53:32.011 --> 02:53:34.740
And the exact same is true for pretty much every profession.

2904
02:53:34.950 --> 02:53:39.030
And yet when aggression gets in there,
it fucks it up.
It's sours,

2905
02:53:39.031 --> 02:53:43.430
it imbalances it,
and it's like ultimately completely ineffective,
you know?

2906
02:53:43.470 --> 02:53:48.090
<v 1>And it's also another version of selfishness.
Yeah.
Right,
right.</v>

2907
02:53:48.091 --> 02:53:49.770
What we talking about before being the problem,

2908
02:53:49.771 --> 02:53:54.480
the real problem with the naked aggressive behavior,
naked aggression,

2909
02:53:54.510 --> 02:53:59.400
meaning unprovoked aggression,
is that it's entirely selfish.

2910
02:53:59.401 --> 02:54:03.690
Like,
I want what you have.
I take,
I conquer.
Yeah.
That,

2911
02:54:03.870 --> 02:54:08.760
that is selfishness and it's worse,
most primal form.
That's right.

2912
02:54:08.820 --> 02:54:11.520
And on that note,
we're gonna wrap this bitch up doc and draws all,

2913
02:54:11.521 --> 02:54:12.330
you're the fucking,
yeah,

2914
02:54:12.330 --> 02:54:15.280
<v 2>you're the man.
Thanks for having me better,
man.</v>

2915
02:54:15.281 --> 02:54:17.620
We need to do this more often that we always say this,

2916
02:54:17.770 --> 02:54:19.360
and let's do a shrimp raid two.
Where's Chris?

2917
02:54:19.361 --> 02:54:21.250
Ryan is driving that fucking van around the world.

2918
02:54:21.460 --> 02:54:24.940
Chris Ryan is going to come back here.
Enlightened every really well.

2919
02:54:24.941 --> 02:54:25.691
I look at his page.

2920
02:54:25.691 --> 02:54:28.240
Every picture he is getting further and further out in the woods.

2921
02:54:30.340 --> 02:54:33.640
I love you buddy.
I love you too.
Bye everybody.
