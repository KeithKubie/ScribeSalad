00:00:00.760 --> 00:00:02.110
How the Milky Way Got Its Name

00:00:02.110 --> 00:00:05.890
Have you ever wondered why our galaxy is called
the Milky Way and what it’s called in other

00:00:05.890 --> 00:00:06.890
languages?

00:00:06.890 --> 00:00:08.380
Well, wonder no more.

00:00:08.380 --> 00:00:12.950
Like many words we use today, the English
name of our galaxy is derived from its Latin

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:14.230
name: Via Lactea.

00:00:14.230 --> 00:00:17.340
Translated, that means “the road of milk.”

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:21.440
The Romans actually got the name from the
Greeks, who called our galaxy “galaxias

00:00:21.440 --> 00:00:23.840
kyklos” or “milky circle.”

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:27.500
Incidentally, the Greek name is also where
we get the term “galaxy.”

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:30.800
No one knows exactly who came up with the
name, but it isn’t difficult to see how

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:32.250
the name came about.

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:36.620
From Earth, at least if you’re well outside
the boundaries of city lights, our galaxy

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:40.819
looks something like a band of milky light
over a black background, as we are viewing

00:00:40.819 --> 00:00:45.090
it on its side and the billions of distant
stars in our galaxy create a nice visible

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:46.359
band of light.

00:00:46.359 --> 00:00:50.370
As for why the ancient Greeks called it the
“milky circle,” the myth goes that Zeus

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:53.640
brought Heracles to Hera to suckle when she
was sleeping.

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:57.420
Hera was in conflict with the little infant,
as you would be if your husband brought home

00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:59.799
a half-mortal child that wasn’t yours.

00:00:59.799 --> 00:01:04.320
As baby Heracles was having his meal, Hera
woke up suddenly and pushed him away, resulting

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:06.000
in a few drops of spilt milk.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.980
The drops created the galaxy that is now known
as the Milky Way.

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:13.940
Various other languages have translations
of “Milky Way” as the name of the galaxy,

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:17.230
such as the German “Milchstrasse” and
the Norwegian “Melkeveien.”

00:01:17.230 --> 00:01:22.290
There are, however, many other mythological
origin stories that explain the various alternate

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:24.890
names of the Milky Way in other languages.

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:29.250
In Finland, the Milky Way is called “Linnunrata,”
or “path of the birds.”

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:33.410
In Finnish Mythology, the world was formed
from a waterfowl’s egg bursting.

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:36.920
The sky was the shell of the egg, and the
Earth as we know it was flat.

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:40.740
At the edges of the Earth was “Lintukoto,”
or the home of the birds.

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:44.600
Lintukoto was a warm region where birds migrated
during the winter.

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:48.561
The band of light that the Greeks thought
of as milk was, according to the Finns, the

00:01:48.561 --> 00:01:50.810
path that the birds took on their way to Lintukoto.

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:54.570
Thus, it’s Linnunrata, “path of the birds.”

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:56.860
Armenia has a different idea about the Milky
Way.

00:01:56.860 --> 00:02:01.500
There, it’s called hard goghi chanaparh,
or “Straw Thief’s Way.”

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:06.990
The story goes that the god Vahagn stole cartloads
of straw Barsham, the Assyrian King, and took

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:09.659
it to Armenia during a particularly cold winter.

00:02:09.659 --> 00:02:13.290
To get there, he fled across the Heavens and
dropped some straw on the way, making the

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:14.290
Milky Way.

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:18.049
Likewise, the Milky Way is called various
forms of “straw way” in several other

00:02:18.049 --> 00:02:20.560
languages across Central Asia and Africa.

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:25.650
It’s Ça Taxina Taça in Chechen, or “the
route of scattered straw;” traditionally

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:30.340
“kumova slama” or “Godfather’s Straw”
in Croatian, though Milky Way is also used

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:34.000
now in Croatia; and samanyolu or “road of
straw” in Turkish.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:38.209
It’s likely that Arabs heard the story in
Armenia first and spread the name to various

00:02:38.209 --> 00:02:39.530
other lands.

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:42.810
In many northern countries, the Milky Way
is called the “Winter Way,” such as the

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:47.629
Icelandic “vetrarbrautin,” the alternative
Norwegian “vinterbrauta,” and the Swedish

00:02:47.629 --> 00:02:48.959
“vintergatan.”

00:02:48.959 --> 00:02:52.340
The reason for this is thought to be because,
in the Northern Hemisphere, the Milky Way

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:54.389
is more visible during the winter.

00:02:54.389 --> 00:02:58.870
In much of East Asia, the galaxy is referred
to as, translated, the “Silver River.”

00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:03.480
A Chinese legend says that once upon a time,
there was a beautiful young maiden named the

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:06.310
Goddess Weaver, the daughter of the Celestial
Queen Mother.

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:10.849
One day, a Buffalo Boy was tending his herd
when he spied the Goddess Weaver bathing in

00:03:10.849 --> 00:03:12.040
a nearby lake.

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:16.080
The two instantly fell in love, and were soon
married and produced two children.

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:19.989
But the Celestial Queen Mother grew jealous
of their love and stole the Goddess Weaver

00:03:19.989 --> 00:03:21.029
away.

00:03:21.029 --> 00:03:25.159
When the Buffalo Boy pursued them, the Queen
took out a pin and drew a silver river between

00:03:25.159 --> 00:03:27.860
them so that they would be separated forever.

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:29.330
That silver river was the Milky Way.

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:34.219
In Japan and Korea “silver river” means
galaxies in general, not just the Milky Way.

00:03:34.219 --> 00:03:37.120
In Spanish, the Milky Way is called a few
different things.

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:39.639
First, via lactea, or the Milky Way.

00:03:39.639 --> 00:03:44.969
Camino de Santiago means the “Road of Santiago”
or “Road to Santiago,” and was used for

00:03:44.969 --> 00:03:49.859
the Milky Way because pilgrims used it to
guide them to Santiago de Compostela, a holy

00:03:49.859 --> 00:03:50.859
site.

00:03:50.859 --> 00:03:53.840
Compostela is the third way to say the name
of the galaxy, and this one is perhaps the

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:55.499
most accurate of all the different names.

00:03:55.499 --> 00:03:58.389
It literally means “the field of stars.”

00:03:58.389 --> 00:04:01.849
Bonus Facts:
• A popular festival in Japan is Tanabata,

00:04:01.849 --> 00:04:03.400
a star festival.

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:06.170
The festival has its origins in the “Silver
River” myth.

00:04:06.170 --> 00:04:10.439
On the seventh day of the seventh month each
year, the Goddess Weaver and the Buffalo Boy

00:04:10.439 --> 00:04:12.329
are allowed to meet for just one day.

00:04:12.329 --> 00:04:16.090
The people celebrate with a day off work or
school, and they write wishes on pieces of

00:04:16.090 --> 00:04:18.510
paper which are then hung from trees.

00:04:18.510 --> 00:04:21.560
In some cities, people light lanterns to float
in nearby rivers.

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:25.740
It’s likely that the celebration got its
start in China some 2000 years ago before

00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:29.710
it migrated to Japan, where it really kicked
off.

00:04:29.710 --> 00:04:34.240
• The Milky Way is thought to contain over
100 billion stars, and could contain up to

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:35.240
400 billion.

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:39.120
It’s about 100,000 light years across.

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:45.230
• Right now you are simultaneously hurtling
around the sun at 66,600 mph while sitting

00:04:45.230 --> 00:04:48.660
on a rock that is spinning at 1,070 mph.

00:04:48.660 --> 00:04:52.150
On top of that, our whole solar system is
rocketing through space around the center

00:04:52.150 --> 00:04:57.750
of the Milky Way at around 559,234 mph.

00:04:57.750 --> 00:05:04.970
On top of that, our galaxy is hurtling through
space at around 671,080 mph, with respect

00:05:04.970 --> 00:05:19.330
to our local group of galaxies.
