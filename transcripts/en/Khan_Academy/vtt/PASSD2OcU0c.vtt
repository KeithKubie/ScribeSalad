00:00:00.920 --> 00:00:04.020
Welcome to the presentation on
more advanced ratio problems.

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:06.240
Let's get started
with some problems.

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:11.870
So let's say that I have a
class, and then-- oh the pen is

00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:17.180
messed up --OK, so in the class
the total number of

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:21.840
students is 57.

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:26.850
And I would also tell you
that the ratio of girls

00:00:26.850 --> 00:00:34.450
to boys is equal to 4:15.

00:00:34.450 --> 00:00:36.425
So now this the interesting
part, so far it

00:00:36.425 --> 00:00:37.530
doesn't look to tough.

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:42.450
My question is how many boys
need to leave the room, so how

00:00:42.450 --> 00:01:02.760
many boys need to leave for the
ratio of girls to

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:10.960
boys to be 4:11.

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:12.590
This is fascinating.

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:15.100
So, a good place to start is
just to figure out how many

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:17.460
girls and how many boys there
are in this classroom.

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:19.650
And we already learned how to
do that in the introduction

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:21.130
to ratio problems.

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:27.140
We know that the girls plus the
boys is equal to 57, right,

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:29.550
because there are 57
kids in the room.

00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:31.810
And we also know, just
multiplying-- taking this

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:36.400
equation --and multiplying both
sides by b, we also know that

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:44.030
the girls are equal to 4/15
times the boys, right?

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:47.040
And then we can just substitute
that back into this equation,

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:58.180
and then we get 4/15b plus b is
equal to 57, is the same thing

00:01:58.180 --> 00:02:04.110
as 19/15b is equal to 57.

00:02:06.910 --> 00:02:10.210
Let me clean this
up a little bit.

00:02:10.210 --> 00:02:14.630
That's separate, and
then let me go here.

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:23.820
And we say b is equal to 57--
oh, woops --it's actually 57

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:27.930
times 15 all of that
over 19, right?

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:31.430
I just multiply both
sides by 15/19.

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:36.260
So 57 divided by 19 is 3.

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:40.520
So b is equal to 45.

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:44.240
And we know there're a total of
57 kids in the class-- g plus

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:48.220
b is 57 --so we know that
there are 12 girls, right?

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:50.370
57 minus 45.

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:51.110
Good.

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:54.240
So now we know that the
current boys and girls

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:58.850
are 45 boys and 12 girls.

00:02:58.850 --> 00:02:59.870
So let's write that down.

00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:07.520
So there's 12 girls
and 45 boys.

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:11.010
Now, the question says, how
many boys need to leave for

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:13.550
the ratio of girls to
boys equals 4 4:11?

00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:15.690
So this is the number of
girls right now, 12,

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:17.170
this is the number boys.

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:21.770
Let's say x is a number of boys
that need to leave the room.

00:03:21.770 --> 00:03:26.950
So if x boys leave the room the
new ratio will be 12 girls to

00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:31.720
the 45 boys minus the x
boys that leave, right?

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:34.490
If that confuses you, sit and
look at that for a second.

00:03:34.490 --> 00:03:38.010
We start off with 12 girls
and 45 boys in the room.

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:40.260
And we're saying x boys are
going to leave, so the new

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:43.820
ratio is going to
be 12:45 minus x.

00:03:43.820 --> 00:03:47.090
And we know from this part of
the problem that that new

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:51.420
ratio is going to equal 4:11.

00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:54.120
There, we just set up a
equation with one unknown

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:56.050
and we can solve for x.

00:03:56.050 --> 00:03:57.130
I hope that doesn't
confuse you much.

00:03:57.130 --> 00:03:59.090
All we did is we figured out
how many boys, how many

00:03:59.090 --> 00:04:00.380
girls are in the room now.

00:04:00.380 --> 00:04:02.900
We said x is the number
boys that need to leave.

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:06.770
And we said the new ratio is
going to be girls to the new

00:04:06.770 --> 00:04:09.280
number of boys, which is 45
minus x, and that's going to

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:11.400
be equal to the new ratio.

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:13.070
So let's solve for x.

00:04:13.070 --> 00:04:19.230
Well, 12 times 11 is
what that's 132.

00:04:19.230 --> 00:04:30.500
132 is equal to 4 times
45, 160, 180, minus 4x.

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:33.320
And then if you solve for x, I
think you know how to do this

00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:42.270
right now, and we can say minus
4x is equal to minus 48.

00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:44.890
x is equal to 12.

00:04:44.890 --> 00:04:45.810
There we solved it.

00:04:45.810 --> 00:04:50.960
So we say that if 12 boys left
the room, the new ratio of

00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:53.430
girls to boys would be 4:11.

00:04:53.430 --> 00:04:54.620
And does that make sense?

00:04:54.620 --> 00:04:57.810
Well if 12 boys left the room,
then the new ratio of girls to

00:04:57.810 --> 00:05:03.440
boys would be 12:33, right?

00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:06.630
Because 45 minus 12 is 33.

00:05:06.630 --> 00:05:08.870
And that's the same thing
as if you divide the

00:05:08.870 --> 00:05:10.020
top and bottom by 3.

00:05:10.020 --> 00:05:11.930
That's 4:11.

00:05:11.930 --> 00:05:13.150
So there, we got it right.

00:05:13.150 --> 00:05:16.200
So what looked like a very hard
problem actually wasn't so bad

00:05:16.200 --> 00:05:21.940
when you just sit down and
work through the algebra.

00:05:21.940 --> 00:05:22.930
Let's do another problem.

00:05:27.930 --> 00:05:35.470
Let's say --this thing
sometimes malfunctions --OK,

00:05:35.470 --> 00:05:41.630
let's say that the ratio of
apples to bananas in a

00:05:41.630 --> 00:05:46.550
basket is equal to 5:19.

00:05:46.550 --> 00:06:03.160
And when we add 23 bananas the
ratio of apples to bananas--

00:06:03.160 --> 00:06:06.330
and actually let's write it
right now, we now have 23

00:06:06.330 --> 00:06:17.370
bananas more --is
equal to 10:61.

00:06:17.370 --> 00:06:20.820
So the question is, what
is the total amount of

00:06:20.820 --> 00:06:21.730
fruit in the basket?

00:06:26.760 --> 00:06:33.020
Amount of fruit-- --ah,
that's so messy --after

00:06:33.020 --> 00:06:33.815
adding the bananas.

00:06:40.790 --> 00:06:42.780
So I actually gave you a
hint just when I wrote

00:06:42.780 --> 00:06:43.700
down initial problem.

00:06:43.700 --> 00:06:48.580
We're saying the ratio of a to
b-- so let a equal the number

00:06:48.580 --> 00:06:52.710
of apples, and b equal the
number bananas --so the ratio

00:06:52.710 --> 00:06:55.450
of apples to bananas
equals 5:19.

00:06:55.450 --> 00:07:01.080
When I add 23 bananas, now the
new ratio's going to be the

00:07:01.080 --> 00:07:04.460
number of apples to b plus 23.

00:07:04.460 --> 00:07:06.600
The new ratio is 10:61.

00:07:06.600 --> 00:07:07.540
So how do we solve this?

00:07:07.540 --> 00:07:10.080
Well, once again we have two
equations and two unknowns.

00:07:10.080 --> 00:07:12.630
We know that-- I guess let's
take this equation first,

00:07:12.630 --> 00:07:18.200
because it's a little more
complicated --we know if we

00:07:18.200 --> 00:07:32.890
cross multiply that 61a is
equal to 10b plus 230 and if we

00:07:32.890 --> 00:07:36.980
divide both sides by 61, we
know that a is equal to

00:07:36.980 --> 00:07:45.830
10/61b plus 230/61.

00:07:45.830 --> 00:07:46.670
Right?

00:07:46.670 --> 00:07:50.070
And we could take this equation
and multiply both sides by b

00:07:50.070 --> 00:07:54.850
and we could say that
a is equal to 5/19b.

00:07:54.850 --> 00:07:55.810
Right?

00:07:55.810 --> 00:07:58.440
Well both of these are equal
to a so we could set them

00:07:58.440 --> 00:07:59.800
equal to each other.

00:07:59.800 --> 00:08:24.550
And you get 5/19b is equal to
10/61b plus 230 times 61.

00:08:24.550 --> 00:08:26.070
And we solve for b.

00:08:26.070 --> 00:08:28.640
While this might seem
complicated to you at first,

00:08:28.640 --> 00:08:31.110
but it's just a basic
linear equation.

00:08:31.110 --> 00:08:33.100
And for the sake of time,
because I only have 2 minutes

00:08:33.100 --> 00:08:33.960
left in this youtube.

00:08:33.960 --> 00:08:39.500
I'm just going to solve for b,
and you get b is equal to 38.

00:08:39.500 --> 00:08:44.700
if b is equal to 38, we know
that the initial ratio is 5:19.

00:08:44.700 --> 00:08:45.620
So that's pretty easy.

00:08:45.620 --> 00:08:53.250
We just say a is equal to 5/19
times 38 is equal to 10.

00:08:53.250 --> 00:08:56.540
So the initial number of apples
was 10, the initial number

00:08:56.540 --> 00:08:58.840
bananas is 38, right?

00:08:58.840 --> 00:09:03.420
So initially we started off
with 48 pieces of fruit, and

00:09:03.420 --> 00:09:09.180
then we're going to add 23
more pieces of fruit, right?

00:09:09.180 --> 00:09:14.660
And 43 plus 28, that's
what, 71 pieces of fruit.

00:09:14.660 --> 00:09:16.250
So, let me review real
quick what we said.

00:09:16.250 --> 00:09:20.430
We said the ratio of apples
to bananas is 5:19.

00:09:20.430 --> 00:09:21.990
That's a is the number
of apples, b is the

00:09:21.990 --> 00:09:23.380
number of bananas.

00:09:23.380 --> 00:09:27.470
When I add 23 bananas, I now
have b plus 23 bananas, the

00:09:27.470 --> 00:09:31.520
new ratio of apples to total
number bananas is 10:61.

00:09:31.520 --> 00:09:33.700
And I just used both
of these equations.

00:09:33.700 --> 00:09:35.610
Two equations and two unknowns.

00:09:35.610 --> 00:09:38.830
Solved for a, and then
substituted, and

00:09:38.830 --> 00:09:39.920
I solved for b.

00:09:39.920 --> 00:09:40.740
Nothing fancy here.

00:09:40.740 --> 00:09:42.120
I know there's a lot of
fractions here, but if you

00:09:42.120 --> 00:09:44.770
just work through this, the
fractions actually work out.

00:09:44.770 --> 00:09:46.750
And I was able to
solve for a and b.

00:09:46.750 --> 00:09:51.120
Add the 23 pieces and I got
71 total pieces of fruit.

00:09:51.120 --> 00:09:53.190
I think you're now ready
to try some of the more

00:09:53.190 --> 00:09:54.980
difficult ratio problems.

00:09:54.980 --> 00:09:56.490
Have fun!
