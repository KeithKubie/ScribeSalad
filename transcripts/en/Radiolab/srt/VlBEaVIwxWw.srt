1
00:00:00,540 --> 00:00:04,050
You are listening to radiolab radio from

2
00:00:07,110 --> 00:00:11,450
W. N. Y. S. T. E. Yup. Hi,

3
00:00:11,451 --> 00:00:15,470
I'm Robert Krulwich. I'm Molly
Webster. This is Radiolab and today

4
00:00:16,970 --> 00:00:19,970
we've got breaking news.
Robert Krulwich on Rick break.

5
00:00:19,971 --> 00:00:22,820
This is something we've never
done before. Never done before.

6
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:26,390
What does anybody know about this yet?
Well, it is a new bit of research.

7
00:00:26,510 --> 00:00:29,660
It's being published today. We've
known about it for the last few months,

8
00:00:30,020 --> 00:00:33,530
but we haven't been able to talk about
it until now. What's this thing about?

9
00:00:33,890 --> 00:00:36,890
Oh, this is a discovery
about Alzheimer's disease,

10
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:41,540
which I think at this point is something
that affects basically every family

11
00:00:42,150 --> 00:00:43,500
affected my family. Yeah.

12
00:00:43,910 --> 00:00:47,270
And this is a discovery
that is not a cure,

13
00:00:47,510 --> 00:00:50,780
but it's basically about
looking at the brain,

14
00:00:51,020 --> 00:00:54,770
which is one of the most complicated
things in the universe, I think.

15
00:00:55,280 --> 00:01:00,280
And poking at it in this super simple way
and getting this bizarre result that's

16
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,060
pretty, pretty bizarre.
Hello? Hello? Hello.

17
00:01:08,120 --> 00:01:11,540
Hi Molly. Hi. How are you?
All right. So last May,

18
00:01:11,541 --> 00:01:15,710
I was talking to some folks over at the
brain institute at MIT and while I was

19
00:01:15,711 --> 00:01:16,401
on the phone with them,

20
00:01:16,401 --> 00:01:20,600
they started telling me about some
research that hadn't been published yet.

21
00:01:20,600 --> 00:01:23,210
So it was all very hush.
Hush is pretty cool though.

22
00:01:23,211 --> 00:01:28,010
We ended up deciding to sign
a nondisclosure agreement
and it was based on the

23
00:01:28,011 --> 00:01:31,700
work of this woman. Leeway
tie the way. Tie, tie,

24
00:01:32,450 --> 00:01:34,080
tie tie a,

25
00:01:34,170 --> 00:01:39,170
I'm a professor and the director of the
Pico Institute for learning a memory at

26
00:01:39,441 --> 00:01:43,560
MIT. Holy Crap. You're a director.
How do you have time to do? Oh,

27
00:01:43,650 --> 00:01:48,200
that's a good question. She is was
like a bad ass is what she is about.

28
00:01:48,201 --> 00:01:52,880
This is a piece of work. Um, I'm
very proud of and very excited about.

29
00:01:53,750 --> 00:01:56,690
Okay, cool. So let me, let me begin. Okay,

30
00:01:56,750 --> 00:02:01,490
so he's Dory Culley people work
on Alzheimer's, really focused.

31
00:02:01,491 --> 00:02:05,450
So I would say generally when you talk
to researchers about Alzheimer's disease,

32
00:02:05,750 --> 00:02:10,490
they either focus on
individual genetic factors,

33
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:11,900
the genetics of the disease,

34
00:02:11,901 --> 00:02:16,901
so the genes that predispose you maybe
to Alzheimer's or the brain chemistry and

35
00:02:16,941 --> 00:02:19,670
how Alzheimer's affects
the chemicals in the brain.

36
00:02:19,700 --> 00:02:23,780
Molay killer pathological features
that in my conversation with leeway,

37
00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:26,820
she was talking about something
totally different. We, we,

38
00:02:26,830 --> 00:02:29,480
we sort of look at it
from a different angle.

39
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:34,070
Her work all centers around
something called the gamma frequency

40
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,500
gamma and what is gay? I'm like,

41
00:02:39,530 --> 00:02:41,480
it feels like something
from Battlestar Galactica,

42
00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:48,640
so I don't think it's that you could
think of it as a particular beat in your

43
00:02:51,651 --> 00:02:55,750
brain, in the brain, which
means let things likely.

44
00:02:56,990 --> 00:02:57,441
Well,

45
00:02:57,441 --> 00:03:01,060
just to oversimplify one of the most
complicated things in the known universe.

46
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:05,350
Okay, please do. You've got your
brain. It's full of neurons,

47
00:03:05,770 --> 00:03:07,360
which are a certain type of brain cell.

48
00:03:07,390 --> 00:03:09,910
We have billions of neurons in the brain.

49
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:15,000
They have these long tentacles that are
reaching out towards other neurons and

50
00:03:15,161 --> 00:03:16,570
for the brain to function,

51
00:03:16,630 --> 00:03:20,590
neurons have to communicate with
each other to process inflammation.

52
00:03:20,740 --> 00:03:24,190
And the way they do
that is they fire. Yes,

53
00:03:24,550 --> 00:03:26,020
an electrical signal.

54
00:03:26,170 --> 00:03:30,220
We'll go through them and it'll like zap
another neuron and it'll turn it on and

55
00:03:30,221 --> 00:03:31,780
then in a like an electrical signal,

56
00:03:31,781 --> 00:03:34,840
we'll go through it and then it'll zap
another neuron and it'll turn it on.

57
00:03:34,841 --> 00:03:37,900
But the cool thing is is that when your
brain is doing things like making you

58
00:03:37,901 --> 00:03:40,750
move or write a poem or
think great thoughts,

59
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:45,960
groups of neurons fire in
sync all together on the
same beat and there's a bunch

60
00:03:48,521 --> 00:03:51,490
of different beats that happen in
the brain. Some of them are slow,

61
00:03:51,730 --> 00:03:55,030
like one beat per second and
that's when you're sleeping.

62
00:03:55,450 --> 00:03:57,730
If you're beating around
10 beats per second,

63
00:03:57,731 --> 00:04:02,731
like maybe you're sitting next to a
campfire in an Adirondack chair or on like

64
00:04:02,951 --> 00:04:04,450
the totally other end of the spectrum,

65
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:09,180
like some neurons fire at 600 beats
per second or do they do that?

66
00:04:09,190 --> 00:04:12,790
I have no idea what all this is going
on. In your head simultaneously. Yeah,

67
00:04:12,791 --> 00:04:13,301
yeah. No,

68
00:04:13,301 --> 00:04:17,830
that's the cool thing is that when
all of these beats in your brain come

69
00:04:17,831 --> 00:04:18,221
together,

70
00:04:18,221 --> 00:04:23,221
that's when you're able to process the
world and understand it as it exists as

71
00:04:24,881 --> 00:04:25,870
human beings.

72
00:04:27,420 --> 00:04:28,253
[inaudible]

73
00:04:31,790 --> 00:04:34,000
Huh? But getting back to our story,

74
00:04:34,210 --> 00:04:38,650
when your brain is doing something
really tricky that requires super focused

75
00:04:39,930 --> 00:04:42,070
tension, working memory and so on,

76
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:45,360
do like trying to find your way
home from the subway station.

77
00:04:45,361 --> 00:04:48,210
Or if you're in a new city,
you know, navigate around it.

78
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:52,440
There's a certain beat, it
sort of rises above them all.

79
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:55,380
And that is the so called gamma frequency.

80
00:04:56,040 --> 00:04:59,700
This range between 30 beats per second
all the way up to a hundred beats per

81
00:04:59,701 --> 00:05:02,460
second. And this gamma
frequency has been, uh,

82
00:05:02,610 --> 00:05:07,440
considered to be very important for
the higher order cognitive function.

83
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:11,040
And the interesting thing is that
when you look at an Alzheimer's brain,

84
00:05:11,041 --> 00:05:15,810
what you see is there's actually less
gamma happening or people say like the

85
00:05:15,811 --> 00:05:17,580
power of Gamma is reduced.

86
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:23,000
Now all the neurons can be recruited
to oscillate at the gamma frequency.

87
00:05:23,311 --> 00:05:27,570
It's still there. It's just quieter. It's
like you turn the volume down. Right.

88
00:05:29,340 --> 00:05:31,480
All right, so just to briefly sum up here,

89
00:05:31,481 --> 00:05:34,540
what we've got is a rhythm
which we call gamma,

90
00:05:34,810 --> 00:05:38,380
which is used when we have complicated
or higher thoughts in the brain,

91
00:05:38,650 --> 00:05:42,970
which when you got Alzheimer's
kind of get saggy retired.

92
00:05:43,060 --> 00:05:45,250
Yeah, totally. And of course,

93
00:05:45,340 --> 00:05:48,700
obviously in an Alzheimer's brain there's
a lot going on and this is just one of

94
00:05:48,701 --> 00:05:51,790
the things, right? You've got the
plaques that build up around the neurons,

95
00:05:51,980 --> 00:05:56,020
this stuff that ducks up your brain and
makes it hard to think. Yeah, totally.

96
00:05:56,021 --> 00:05:59,630
It's like cobwebs in the brain and then
the connections between neurons gets all

97
00:05:59,631 --> 00:06:03,050
muddied and immune cells get
messed up. But leeway tie was like,

98
00:06:05,030 --> 00:06:09,530
forget all that. What would happen
if I just bring the gamma back? Yeah.

99
00:06:10,250 --> 00:06:15,250
We decided to just manipulate
gamma oscillations.

100
00:06:17,590 --> 00:06:22,570
And how do you, how do you do that?
Well, hello. Hello? Hello? Hello? Hello?

101
00:06:22,571 --> 00:06:26,510
Hello? Hello. Hello Technology.
Hi, this is Molly. Hi. Hi. Hi.

102
00:06:26,540 --> 00:06:30,140
Technology you can find at the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology.

103
00:06:30,890 --> 00:06:35,600
And actually I went and took a train
up to Boston to MIT not too long ago,

104
00:06:36,020 --> 00:06:38,090
walking in, did a big hour institute.

105
00:06:38,180 --> 00:06:41,530
It's a big shiny glass building. Why

106
00:06:43,250 --> 00:06:46,790
eventually leeway tie came striding
into her office to meet me.

107
00:06:46,850 --> 00:06:51,050
And my understanding is that you want
to see some of the experimental setup.

108
00:06:51,260 --> 00:06:54,500
And so we way led me down
the hall to this tiny room.

109
00:06:55,570 --> 00:06:59,870
The mice just entered the room,
brought in these adorable little mice.

110
00:06:59,900 --> 00:07:03,410
Oh my gosh. They're like little
black and soft and furry. Yeah.

111
00:07:03,670 --> 00:07:07,530
Their ears are tagged with a little
metal tag on that. Yeah. Okay. So,

112
00:07:07,570 --> 00:07:12,080
so here's what they did. They get some
ice. We started off with a mouse model,

113
00:07:12,140 --> 00:07:14,240
not the mice. I actually
got all excited over,

114
00:07:14,241 --> 00:07:18,530
but my set at an early stage of
Alzheimer's disease was my depo.

115
00:07:18,620 --> 00:07:20,270
Notable defects.

116
00:07:20,420 --> 00:07:24,200
And do they have the gunky plaque
stuff in them yet or is that later? No,

117
00:07:24,201 --> 00:07:28,790
but they do have elevated levels
of um, open amyloid peptides,

118
00:07:28,820 --> 00:07:31,910
which is this protein
that forms the plaques.

119
00:07:31,970 --> 00:07:34,430
So it's like basically preplan gunk.

120
00:07:34,490 --> 00:07:38,720
But the important thing to leeway tie
in our team is that they have less gamma

121
00:07:38,721 --> 00:07:40,880
going on in their brains. If you remember,

122
00:07:40,881 --> 00:07:44,420
the whole plan here is to
bring the gamma back. Yes.

123
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:46,250
So to do that,

124
00:07:47,090 --> 00:07:51,680
they get what might be the world's
tiniest drill and they drill a small hole

125
00:07:51,710 --> 00:07:55,790
into the skull of the mouse and then they
take a really thin fiber optic cable.

126
00:07:55,791 --> 00:07:58,130
They slide it through
the hole into the brain,

127
00:07:58,220 --> 00:08:02,870
and then they get this laser of blue
light to flicker at 40 beats per second.

128
00:08:02,900 --> 00:08:05,510
Yeah, Ma frequency. And they turn
that on and the light travels

129
00:08:05,530 --> 00:08:08,140
down the fiber optic cable
deep down into the brain,

130
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:12,430
to this group of cells that
they've modified in the
hippocampus to be sensitive

131
00:08:12,431 --> 00:08:15,760
to light. So when this
pulsing light hit the cells,

132
00:08:15,761 --> 00:08:19,570
they actually began to fire at 40
beats per second at gamma frequency.

133
00:08:19,571 --> 00:08:22,600
And they would keep these cells
firing a gamma for one hour,

134
00:08:22,870 --> 00:08:26,380
firing and firing and firing
and firing and firing. And then

135
00:08:27,270 --> 00:08:29,400
after one hour they turn off the light.

136
00:08:29,460 --> 00:08:33,780
And then eventually they started looking
at the brains of these mice trying to

137
00:08:33,781 --> 00:08:38,781
figure out if anything was different after
the light flashed and they see to our

138
00:08:39,811 --> 00:08:42,990
much surprise or not
expecting this at all,

139
00:08:43,020 --> 00:08:47,250
we found after they shot this
pulsing light into the brain,

140
00:08:47,251 --> 00:08:52,110
there was suddenly nearly half as
much of that soon to be nasty plaque,

141
00:08:52,111 --> 00:08:55,970
gunk stuff that was filling up their
hippocampus. [inaudible] half the, yeah.

142
00:08:56,380 --> 00:08:58,860
Yes. Half of the stuff
was just swept away. Yes.

143
00:08:58,890 --> 00:09:02,430
40 to 50% reduction of Beta amyloid.

144
00:09:02,460 --> 00:09:06,540
That just seems crazy.
This is crazy. I mean,

145
00:09:06,930 --> 00:09:10,920
we were just so surprised.
They know why the, yeah. Yeah,

146
00:09:10,921 --> 00:09:15,921
so turned out to the pulsing light somehow
triggered the brain's cleanup crew,

147
00:09:16,020 --> 00:09:19,650
microglia. These cells in the
brain that are called Microglia,

148
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:23,580
you can say they're the janitors of
the brain, and in a normal brain,

149
00:09:23,610 --> 00:09:26,250
these janitor cells
usually gobble up the gunk.

150
00:09:26,280 --> 00:09:30,390
But in Alzheimer's disease it's
known that Michael [inaudible],

151
00:09:30,470 --> 00:09:33,450
they don't sort of
function normally anymore.

152
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:38,520
It's like these janitors just sort
of stop cleaning up and go on strike.

153
00:09:38,790 --> 00:09:42,750
There we go. Okay, cool. Okay. So we're
looking at a screen that's now flat.

154
00:09:42,780 --> 00:09:46,020
It's not, not when I was at MIT,
one of Leeways Grad students,

155
00:09:46,050 --> 00:09:47,670
my name is Anthony March row.

156
00:09:47,910 --> 00:09:52,620
Second Year was showing me side by side
comparisons of these mice brains on the

157
00:09:52,621 --> 00:09:57,090
screen. Can you guess what that is?
Which part? The green things. Microglia.

158
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:03,540
And you see after one hour
of gamma. Wow. So that, yeah,

159
00:10:03,541 --> 00:10:08,541
that the Michael [inaudible] the
cell seems a lot bigger clearly.

160
00:10:08,791 --> 00:10:11,720
See these round bodies. Yeah.

161
00:10:12,450 --> 00:10:16,830
And also the bally sims
will have more amyloid. Oh,

162
00:10:16,831 --> 00:10:21,330
like they're doing more eating. Yes.
They go back to eat more amyloid again.

163
00:10:21,450 --> 00:10:25,980
It's like somehow making the neurons fire
turned on the sanitation system in the

164
00:10:25,981 --> 00:10:30,420
brain. But the most wild results, wait,

165
00:10:30,421 --> 00:10:32,190
there's more wild, oh my God,

166
00:10:32,430 --> 00:10:35,640
you gotta hear this because
what I'm about to tell you,

167
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:41,050
you may say no, I don't believe
it. It's science fiction. Okay. So,

168
00:10:41,060 --> 00:10:44,430
so one of the things leeway and her
team were starting to think was that

169
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:48,390
drilling and fiber optic
cable is very invasive. Right.

170
00:10:48,450 --> 00:10:52,800
You'd never be able to do that on a
human. Exactly. So we started to say,

171
00:10:52,860 --> 00:10:53,693
well,

172
00:10:53,700 --> 00:10:58,410
what if we can get the light into
the brain in a different way?

173
00:10:58,470 --> 00:11:03,240
Like maybe we could go through the eyes
towing the hole in your head would be

174
00:11:03,241 --> 00:11:05,610
your eyes instead of a whole. Yes.

175
00:11:06,090 --> 00:11:10,650
So leeway and her team created what I
like to think of as the flicker room.

176
00:11:11,570 --> 00:11:15,120
This is the room, this is the
room, and then it turns out,

177
00:11:15,121 --> 00:11:18,330
I learned upon my visit, it is just a
storage closet. You know you have a,

178
00:11:19,020 --> 00:11:23,200
what is this? Just like a plastic
table. Very DIY. Yeah, it's a,

179
00:11:23,310 --> 00:11:25,350
it's a plastic table
you can buy at target.

180
00:11:25,410 --> 00:11:28,740
There were some plastic shoe box size
containers lined up on the table for the

181
00:11:28,741 --> 00:11:29,460
mice.

182
00:11:29,460 --> 00:11:34,460
And then see the strip around the edge
of the table physically surrounding all

183
00:11:35,251 --> 00:11:39,060
the pages are duck tape
strips of led lights.

184
00:11:39,090 --> 00:11:42,600
And the reason why we use LEDs
is because a regular light bulb,

185
00:11:42,970 --> 00:11:44,880
it can't flash fast enough.

186
00:11:44,970 --> 00:11:49,380
And so the idea is what if we just put
the mice in this room and just let the

187
00:11:49,381 --> 00:11:51,570
light flicker at 40 beats per second.

188
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:54,340
So you want to show Molly
like attorneys on, yeah,

189
00:11:54,460 --> 00:11:58,380
and so we turn off the overhead light in
the room, so it's very black and white

190
00:11:58,410 --> 00:12:00,240
then. Oh Wow.

191
00:12:00,630 --> 00:12:04,620
The room was now glowing with
this white led light. Okay.

192
00:12:04,621 --> 00:12:08,360
So the light is turning on and off 40
times a second. It's so there's, you know,

193
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:11,790
you don't see anything going like on or
off. It just looks like something's on.

194
00:12:11,791 --> 00:12:16,791
But it kind of feels like
my eye is twitching and so
it's blurring the blurring

195
00:12:17,080 --> 00:12:20,720
the light a little just on the
edges though, on the edges.

196
00:12:20,760 --> 00:12:25,410
And do they put mice in this room for
an hour and just let them kind of bays

197
00:12:25,860 --> 00:12:28,800
bathe in this, in this
glow. And guess what?

198
00:12:30,090 --> 00:12:35,090
What we look at the amyloid Beta levels
in the visual cortex and we found there

199
00:12:36,951 --> 00:12:38,870
is a 50% reduction,

200
00:12:39,470 --> 00:12:43,620
50% 50% of the doctors shining
light in their eyeballs.

201
00:12:43,650 --> 00:12:45,960
Yes they did.

202
00:12:46,220 --> 00:12:50,190
They didn't do any drilling or
anything? No, they didn't drill.

203
00:12:50,191 --> 00:12:52,860
They didn't tweak the mouse's brain
cells to be sensitive to light.

204
00:12:52,890 --> 00:12:57,330
This is just the room with occasional
LEDs flashing at a particular frequency

205
00:12:57,360 --> 00:13:01,150
for an hour. Now do you see,
are you going to tell me?

206
00:13:01,151 --> 00:13:03,580
I don't believe it is science fiction.

207
00:13:05,630 --> 00:13:09,890
And they follow this study up with another
study which was done in the same way.

208
00:13:09,891 --> 00:13:13,880
So at the same flicker room light through
the eyeballs and only this time they

209
00:13:13,881 --> 00:13:18,800
put the mice in there for one hour a day
for seven days and they took mice that

210
00:13:18,801 --> 00:13:22,430
had full blown Alzheimer's. So
this is like cognitive decline.

211
00:13:22,670 --> 00:13:27,320
They're forgetting things and they've
got hardened plaques in their brain and

212
00:13:27,590 --> 00:13:31,550
they see the same thing. Nearly
half of the stuff was cleared away.

213
00:13:32,750 --> 00:13:33,583
Half.

214
00:13:37,310 --> 00:13:41,030
It's just flickering light in
front of the mice. That's the shot.

215
00:13:41,031 --> 00:13:42,290
I mean that's the shocking thing.

216
00:13:42,620 --> 00:13:45,470
The thing I didn't understand after
talking to you about your study was I was

217
00:13:45,471 --> 00:13:48,620
like, why hasn't everyone done this
before? Like why didn't everyone go?

218
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:52,220
We should just shine light
through eyes. See? Well you know,

219
00:13:52,250 --> 00:13:57,250
that's really the most unexpected
and exciting aspect of our study,

220
00:13:58,310 --> 00:14:01,790
which is some sin this simple. Yet.

221
00:14:02,180 --> 00:14:06,240
You know it has never been done before.
You know that. One of the things,

222
00:14:06,300 --> 00:14:11,300
one of the caveats here is that if you
don't do the flicker light room every 24

223
00:14:11,701 --> 00:14:12,121
hours,

224
00:14:12,121 --> 00:14:15,600
the level of gunk in the brain starts
going back up again and so now they're

225
00:14:15,601 --> 00:14:18,240
trying to figure out how they
can keep those levels down.

226
00:14:18,241 --> 00:14:23,241
Maybe even for good if the mouse no
longer has quite as much junk in its head.

227
00:14:25,660 --> 00:14:30,060
Does that mean that it can remember
things that happened to it?

228
00:14:31,020 --> 00:14:35,950
Yeah. Yeah. That is their big next
research. That's what they are.

229
00:14:36,220 --> 00:14:38,800
They don't know that's what they're
to. That is now the next step,

230
00:14:38,890 --> 00:14:43,810
but nobody really understands how
plaques and the gunk buildup in the brain

231
00:14:43,811 --> 00:14:48,811
relates to memory and cognition and the
dogma in the field is that when you have

232
00:14:49,601 --> 00:14:50,351
Alzheimer's,

233
00:14:50,351 --> 00:14:54,710
you can't form new memories
and once you lose a memory,

234
00:14:54,711 --> 00:14:55,580
it's gone for good.

235
00:14:56,270 --> 00:15:01,010
But there is another group at MIT that
is actually sort of challenging that

236
00:15:01,011 --> 00:15:04,610
assumption that you can never get a memory
back because the patient could never

237
00:15:04,611 --> 00:15:09,140
tell us. We all assumed the information
had to be gone. Oh really? Yeah,

238
00:15:09,260 --> 00:15:11,750
and we'll get to them, but
first we have to go to a break.

Yes, he is radio lab and we're back.

252
00:16:13,130 --> 00:16:18,130
And just before the break you said that
there may be a way to bring a memory

253
00:16:19,371 --> 00:16:21,140
back from the Alzheimer's.

254
00:16:21,141 --> 00:16:25,520
Does pull the memory back into
back into place. Yeah. Why?

255
00:16:25,580 --> 00:16:29,270
Why are we so quick to jump
to the conclusion that the
information was somehow

256
00:16:29,271 --> 00:16:32,510
completely gone? And the person
who said that to me is this guy,

257
00:16:32,570 --> 00:16:33,470
I'm Dheeraj Roy,

258
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:38,250
I'm a fourth year graduate student in
the Sumo Tonegawa lab over at the town of

259
00:16:38,540 --> 00:16:39,860
gala lab. They were thinking,

260
00:16:39,890 --> 00:16:44,890
what if we could figure out exactly where
the memory should be in the brain and

261
00:16:45,321 --> 00:16:47,870
just give that spot a
little bit of juice, right?

262
00:16:48,950 --> 00:16:52,370
So they took some mice that were just
starting to lose their ability to remember

263
00:16:52,371 --> 00:16:55,310
things and they thought, okay,
let's try to give them a memory.

264
00:16:55,570 --> 00:16:58,010
We put them in a box that
has a particular smell,

265
00:16:58,040 --> 00:17:00,620
some sort of lighting and
some texture on their feet.

266
00:17:00,740 --> 00:17:05,620
A little mouse carpet or that's exactly
what it is. Yeah. Okay. My son cockpits.

267
00:17:05,630 --> 00:17:06,380
Got It.

268
00:17:06,380 --> 00:17:10,340
The point is the box looks and feels
and smells different than any other box

269
00:17:10,410 --> 00:17:13,580
they would hang out in. And then you'd
give them a light electrical shock.

270
00:17:14,270 --> 00:17:17,000
And the mice, they just
freeze. They don't move at all,

271
00:17:17,030 --> 00:17:19,460
which is a sign that they're
afraid, the hate the box

272
00:17:20,510 --> 00:17:21,110
[inaudible]

273
00:17:21,110 --> 00:17:24,320
and for the rest of the afternoon, which
is a very long time and mouse time,

274
00:17:24,321 --> 00:17:26,150
they go on hating the box,

275
00:17:26,151 --> 00:17:28,250
which means with the carpet
and the light and the smell,

276
00:17:28,310 --> 00:17:32,750
if you put it back in there, it'll
freeze because it remembers the shot.

277
00:17:33,080 --> 00:17:36,470
Yes. But a day or a week later,

278
00:17:36,471 --> 00:17:39,740
which when the same mice were
put back into the same box,

279
00:17:39,770 --> 00:17:41,540
instead of being scared of the box,

280
00:17:41,620 --> 00:17:43,730
they would just continue
investigating as if nothing happened.

281
00:17:44,450 --> 00:17:45,410
They could not remember.

282
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:49,530
So Dheeraj and his team did leeway,

283
00:17:49,531 --> 00:17:52,740
did they got some modified mice and then
they put a little hole in their head.

284
00:17:52,840 --> 00:17:54,500
They slid in a fiber optic
cable, they [inaudible]

285
00:17:54,560 --> 00:17:59,180
shine some light to trigger the
neurons if they think hold this memory.

286
00:17:59,480 --> 00:18:02,960
And they were a fear section
near the fear section.

287
00:18:02,961 --> 00:18:07,330
So leading on the path to the fear
section. So we do this and then

288
00:18:07,970 --> 00:18:09,350
put them back into the box,

289
00:18:09,380 --> 00:18:12,740
the box with a particular lighting
and smell and carpet and ask,

290
00:18:13,460 --> 00:18:17,120
is there any change in their
behavior? Will they act afraid again?

291
00:18:17,420 --> 00:18:18,680
Do they show any more memory?

292
00:18:20,780 --> 00:18:25,700
And they did wait. Shut up. They actually
were scared of the box again. Exactly.

293
00:18:26,060 --> 00:18:30,950
They showed recovered memory.
Wow. Oh, so that's like Bam.

294
00:18:30,951 --> 00:18:32,030
That memory is in there.

295
00:18:32,150 --> 00:18:35,210
Exactly. [inaudible] behaviors back

296
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:40,220
and you can dig up the memory by
shining light in the right place.

297
00:18:41,870 --> 00:18:42,703
Yeah.

298
00:18:43,070 --> 00:18:47,560
I was always under the impression that
the memories were totally lost. Right.

299
00:18:47,570 --> 00:18:50,960
So I think that's not just you. I think
that's essentially the entire field,

300
00:18:51,170 --> 00:18:53,030
what you described just because,

301
00:18:53,140 --> 00:18:55,400
and that's good because the
patient could never tell us.

302
00:18:55,790 --> 00:18:59,000
We all assume that the
information had to be gone. Huh.

303
00:18:59,540 --> 00:19:03,170
So one of the things to say is that
Dheeraj did tell me that, you know,

304
00:19:03,171 --> 00:19:08,171
all of the experiments they did are
in mice that have early Alzheimer's.

305
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:12,560
Uh, the thought is though is that once
you get to the late stage of the disease,

306
00:19:12,590 --> 00:19:15,380
there's enough damage in the brain that
you really wouldn't be able to get those

307
00:19:15,381 --> 00:19:16,220
memories back.

308
00:19:16,790 --> 00:19:21,470
That might be right that a
memory lost is just lost.

309
00:19:21,471 --> 00:19:26,450
But you know, when you, when you
have someone in your house and you,

310
00:19:26,870 --> 00:19:29,750
um, and you live with this
disease day in and day out,

311
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:35,200
the disease just goes its own way and
it can puzzle you or frighten you or

312
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:44,000
suddenly declare something new that
you didn't expect. So for example,

313
00:19:44,001 --> 00:19:48,710
my dad had it for about
nine, 10 years. Uh,

314
00:19:48,800 --> 00:19:53,090
it was a slow, active disappearing
that he did where, I mean,

315
00:19:53,091 --> 00:19:58,091
the last time my father came
to was so far into the disease,

316
00:20:00,530 --> 00:20:02,630
he hadn't spoken for a year and a half.

317
00:20:03,080 --> 00:20:08,000
He was sitting at the table for the
Passover Seder and there's a song that you

318
00:20:08,001 --> 00:20:12,080
sing and it goes, died
a new die, die. Ain't no

319
00:20:14,970 --> 00:20:19,160
[inaudible]. So it's just a
chorus. And from out of nowhere,

320
00:20:19,910 --> 00:20:24,150
this being at the end of the table,

321
00:20:24,151 --> 00:20:25,340
who I knew was my father,

322
00:20:25,341 --> 00:20:29,570
who hadn't spoken in a year and a half
or two and had not spoken coherently for

323
00:20:29,571 --> 00:20:30,404
three,

324
00:20:30,800 --> 00:20:35,180
suddenly flew into the song

325
00:20:36,770 --> 00:20:36,900
[inaudible]

326
00:20:36,900 --> 00:20:41,130
and sang the song full
throated Lee at the table.

327
00:20:44,220 --> 00:20:45,053
[inaudible]

328
00:20:45,130 --> 00:20:47,980
the reappearance of some just figment

329
00:20:47,980 --> 00:20:48,813
of himself.

330
00:20:51,230 --> 00:20:51,550
[inaudible]

331
00:20:51,550 --> 00:20:56,530
and it was, it was both horrifying
and extraordinary. Both,

332
00:20:56,531 --> 00:20:59,460
you know. Yeah.

333
00:20:59,500 --> 00:21:03,340
I think that's the fact that maybe
some information still the persists.

334
00:21:03,370 --> 00:21:08,110
Hopefully someday we get kind of, maybe
there's something we could do. Um,

335
00:21:08,140 --> 00:21:08,973
but yeah,

336
00:21:10,040 --> 00:21:12,230
[inaudible] in my mind at the moment,

337
00:21:17,540 --> 00:21:22,540
as long as we can figure out how to
reboot the pathway to retrieve the memory,

338
00:21:25,040 --> 00:21:28,730
then I think there is hope.
This is the way tie again,

339
00:21:28,760 --> 00:21:30,500
but you know, I,

340
00:21:30,680 --> 00:21:35,600
I personally seeing the most important
question is whether humans respond

341
00:21:35,810 --> 00:21:37,090
similarly. I mean,

342
00:21:37,091 --> 00:21:42,091
keep in mind that both Daraja
study and leeway ties are in mice,

343
00:21:42,101 --> 00:21:46,700
not humans. Right. So I do have a
thought that like, why, like, um,

344
00:21:47,170 --> 00:21:50,950
is there a reason that a human neuron
might react differently than a mouse?

345
00:21:51,060 --> 00:21:55,020
The thing is as thing, especially,
you know, in Alzheimer's feel, I mean,

346
00:21:55,021 --> 00:21:57,070
people got burned a lot.
Yeah. Just, you know,

347
00:21:57,071 --> 00:22:02,071
there's like a 99.6% failure rate in
moving something that seemed to work in

348
00:22:02,621 --> 00:22:06,400
mice to humans in Alzheimer's. Yeah. Yeah.

349
00:22:06,440 --> 00:22:10,540
That was a study that came out in
2012. That's a horrible number.

350
00:22:10,670 --> 00:22:15,600
So I just gotta be
really conservative here.

351
00:22:15,830 --> 00:22:19,670
Dial it back. I'll dial it back. You
know, all we have in mice, the just,

352
00:22:19,820 --> 00:22:24,170
just so exciting and so
unexpected, so much fun.

353
00:22:25,550 --> 00:22:27,170
Um, but you know,

354
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:31,280
I'm gonna keep my mind open
when it comes to humans.

355
00:22:31,580 --> 00:22:32,351
The plan is,

356
00:22:32,351 --> 00:22:35,780
is that we're going to find out because
they're going straight to humans. Oh.

357
00:22:35,900 --> 00:22:39,230
So can do human trials. Well, they
want to, so yeah, I guess we'll see.

358
00:22:39,470 --> 00:22:43,460
This is the glorious part of
all this. This organ of ours,

359
00:22:43,490 --> 00:22:46,820
the brain is so crazily
complicated with like whatever,

360
00:22:46,821 --> 00:22:51,470
100 trillion connections or whatever
it is. There's so much chance.

361
00:22:52,100 --> 00:22:55,400
There's gonna be a lot of
surprise. Yeah. It's like almost,

362
00:22:55,401 --> 00:23:00,360
even if it doesn't lead to any,
uh, treatment in humans or, um,

363
00:23:00,380 --> 00:23:02,510
something super concrete. It's like,

364
00:23:02,540 --> 00:23:04,760
we know this little secret
about the brain now,

365
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:08,300
and there's something that
feels like beautiful in that.

366
00:23:18,540 --> 00:23:22,290
Yeah. I'm actually, I'm setting
this up for my Christmas tree.

367
00:23:23,130 --> 00:23:25,230
Are you really? Yes. Oh wait,

368
00:23:25,260 --> 00:23:28,890
I just bought the new
led lights and they can,

369
00:23:28,920 --> 00:23:31,680
they can flick her a different
color with different colors.

370
00:23:32,110 --> 00:23:35,830
Each individual bulb can travel through
colors, but while they're doing that,

371
00:23:35,831 --> 00:23:38,650
they're going to be
flickering at 40. Well,

372
00:23:38,740 --> 00:23:43,490
you're going to have a very
therapeutic Christmas in the,

373
00:23:43,491 --> 00:23:47,750
in the leeway tie household. This
is the tree in your home. Oh,

374
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:52,700
yes. Yes. Are you using, I want to
have an eggnog next to that tree.

375
00:23:54,050 --> 00:23:58,280
Okay. Thank you, Molly, for what?
A remarkable story that was. Um,

376
00:23:58,730 --> 00:24:03,110
you're welcome. It was also produced
by Eddie Mcewen, Matt Kielty,

377
00:24:03,230 --> 00:24:07,280
Molly Webster, again with help from
Simon Adler and special thanks to

378
00:24:08,900 --> 00:24:12,680
Sumu Tonegawa at MIT, and thank
you all for listening. Bye.
