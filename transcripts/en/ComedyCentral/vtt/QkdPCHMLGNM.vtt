-(cheering, applause)

00:00:07.373 --> 00:00:10.676
What a Merry Christmas special
it's been.

00:00:10.709 --> 00:00:14.347
And now it's time for the last
Christmas gift of the evening.

00:00:14.380 --> 00:00:17.216
I'm going to give Bebe
her exclusive.

00:00:17.249 --> 00:00:18.651
Oh! Finally!

00:00:18.684 --> 00:00:20.987
-Here it is.
-Okay. (clears throat)

00:00:21.020 --> 00:00:23.289
(whispering):
I... came up...

00:00:23.322 --> 00:00:25.391
with Christmas.

00:00:25.424 --> 00:00:27.960
What? No, that's
the title of your special.

00:00:27.993 --> 00:00:31.064
<i> And</i> you didn't come up
with Christmas.

00:00:31.097 --> 00:00:33.232
I came up with<i> my</i> Christmas.

00:00:33.265 --> 00:00:36.869
And it's totally different
from regular Christmas.

00:00:36.902 --> 00:00:40.206
Regular Christmas is supposed
to be about celebrating

00:00:40.239 --> 00:00:41.774
the birth of Jesus--

00:00:41.807 --> 00:00:44.644
a man who was selfless and kind

00:00:44.677 --> 00:00:46.846
and died for our sins.

00:00:46.879 --> 00:00:48.981
But I'm greedy and petty.

00:00:49.014 --> 00:00:51.717
And<i> you</i> die for<i> my</i> sins!

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:54.187
I'm the opposite of Christ.

00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:57.256
I'm the Antichrist.

00:00:57.289 --> 00:00:59.092
But I am a savior

00:00:59.125 --> 00:01:01.894
of myself, my family,

00:01:01.927 --> 00:01:04.263
and some of the worst,
most hateful ideas

00:01:04.296 --> 00:01:07.266
that decent Americans thought
were long dead.

00:01:07.299 --> 00:01:10.036
Stop waiting
for a Christmas miracle.

00:01:10.069 --> 00:01:12.839
Whatcha see is whatcha get.

00:01:12.872 --> 00:01:16.509
I'm not gonna suddenly turn
into a Christian...

00:01:16.542 --> 00:01:19.145
or a populist...

00:01:19.178 --> 00:01:21.314
or a good friend...

00:01:21.347 --> 00:01:23.549
or a good father...

00:01:23.582 --> 00:01:26.052
or become presidential...

00:01:26.085 --> 00:01:30.323
or even a politician who
actually believes what he says.

00:01:30.356 --> 00:01:31.724
(sneezes, sniffs)

00:01:31.757 --> 00:01:33.292
I'm me.

00:01:33.325 --> 00:01:34.994
Get used to it.

00:01:35.027 --> 00:01:36.596
Wise up.

-(cheering, applause)

00:04:38.811 --> 00:04:41.213
Unless... unless...

00:04:41.246 --> 00:04:44.150
Americans got more creative
with their civil disobedience

00:04:44.183 --> 00:04:47.119
and used the Constitution as
a weapon against the main person

00:04:47.152 --> 00:04:48.754
who's sworn to uphold it.

00:04:48.787 --> 00:04:50.956
And can you imagine
if the Democratic Party

00:04:50.989 --> 00:04:53.859
actually rallied behind
a coherent message that speaks

00:04:53.892 --> 00:04:56.295
to the working class people
I conned?

00:04:56.328 --> 00:04:58.331
They could even take
my catchphrase:

00:04:58.364 --> 00:05:00.599
Make America great again.

00:05:00.632 --> 00:05:04.637
It's the perfect slogan for
whoever runs against me in 2020,

00:05:04.670 --> 00:05:07.340
because I'm making America
a lot of things,

00:05:07.373 --> 00:05:09.942
but great isn't one of them.

00:05:09.975 --> 00:05:12.511
-(gunshot, glass shatters)
-Whoa! -Aah!

00:05:12.544 --> 00:05:15.581

the coal vent, Dad!

00:05:15.614 --> 00:05:17.550
Oh. Wait a minute.

00:05:17.583 --> 00:05:19.752
Is that what I think it is?

00:05:19.785 --> 00:05:22.021
It's coaling, everyone!

00:05:22.054 --> 00:05:23.856
