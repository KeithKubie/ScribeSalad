00:00:01.710 --> 00:00:02.670
- Hi, I'm Trystan.

00:00:02.670 --> 00:00:03.670
I started bladesmithing

00:00:03.670 --> 00:00:05.000
about four years ago--

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.040
almost five, actually,
on the 12th.

00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:09.330
The 12th will be
my fifth year anniversary,

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:11.880
which is really exciting.
[laughs]

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:14.210
This was my first anvil.

00:00:14.210 --> 00:00:16.920
Uh, my bus driver actually
gave it to me.

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:18.620
I have a lot of people
that really support me

00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:20.380
in bladesmithing and they think
it's a really cool hobby

00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:21.880
that I'm doing.

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:24.170
So my bus driver was like,
"Hey, I have this.

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:26.380
Uh, if you want it,
then it's yours."

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:27.920
It's kind of awesome.

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:31.750
It's like I'm here because of
the community around me.

00:00:31.750 --> 00:00:33.210
- Hey, so I'm Mike Deibert,

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:34.880
and here, we're at my shop.

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:36.620
I just want to give you
a little tour,

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:40.420
with the help of Benjamin
and Isaiah.

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:42.040
All right, follow me.

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:44.790
Over here is my pride and joy--
this is Rosie.

00:00:44.790 --> 00:00:46.750
Some really awesome people
helped me

00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:48.420
to get this power hammer.

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:50.250
When I moved back to the U.S.,

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:53.170
we didn't have a lot of
equipment

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:54.750
for me to continue forging

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:57.670
and these guys took it
upon themself

00:00:57.670 --> 00:01:01.750
to raffle off some knives
and voila, look at this.

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:04.500
This is what awesome
friendships create.

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:07.500
And I'm very, very thankful
for it.

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:10.120
- This is a 20-ton
hydraulic press

00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:12.880
that my uncle lent me.

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:14.790
It's pretty cool.

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:16.420
You press this button.

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:17.960
[loud rattling]

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:20.120
And it starts pressing,
and then you twist this knob

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:21.420
and it goes back up.

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:23.290
This was actually
an auto body press,

00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:26.960
so it's not really designed
for bladesmithing application,

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:29.120
so it doesn't have, like,
the foot pedal or anything

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:32.080
to make it more convenient for
somebody holding hot metal.

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:36.040
So this is kind of like
what I really enjoy doing,

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:37.380
this style of knife.

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:38.670
It's just kind of pretty.

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:39.960
I like the curves of the handle

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:41.290
and all the twists and stuff.

00:01:41.290 --> 00:01:43.750
They're pretty functional
pieces too,

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:46.500
but they're just really
more artistic

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:48.380
and I think I like that part
about bladesmithing;

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:49.880
how artistic you can be,

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:51.380
'cause before
I was a bladesmith,

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:53.960
I was more of an artist,
so I would draw a lot

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:57.670
and I used to do pottery
and stuff, painting classes,

00:01:57.670 --> 00:02:00.330
just anything that is more
expressive that I can do.

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:04.500
Like, I'm in culinary school
right now as well, so...

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:07.960
I just dabble in the arts.
[laughs]

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:10.080
- These two pieces of equipment
over here--

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:13.670
this 25-ton press
and 25-pound little giant--

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:17.540
these were both equipment
by the late John White,

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:20.500
master bladesmith with
American Bladesmith Society.

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:24.920
He was a true inspiration
to many, many bladesmiths,

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:26.460
including myself.

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:29.210
Unfortunately, about three
years ago he passed away.

00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:31.540
To have some of his equipment
in his shop

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:33.830
is a huge, huge deal to me.

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:36.880
Every time I use it, I think
of him and his legacy.

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:41.830
And this is my lovely bride,
Lauren.

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:44.500
Mother of five awesome boys,

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:48.080
and the one who lets me do
what I do in the shop.

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:51.290
I couldn't do any of
this without her.

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:54.000
Thanks, babe.
[chuckles]
