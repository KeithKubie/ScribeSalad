00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:04.790
Mr. Clifford: I'm Mr. Clifford... and this
is Adriene Hill, welcome to Crash Course economics.

00:00:04.790 --> 00:00:07.860
Let's start by talking about something that
most people take for granted.

00:00:07.860 --> 00:00:12.140
Adriene: Is it grocery stores, is it the census,
is it GPS, is it goldfish, is it frogs? Oh,

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:13.360
it's probably these strawberries, right?

00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:15.300
Mr. Clifford: No, I was gonna say markets.

00:00:15.300 --> 00:00:16.420
Adriene: But, strawberries are great.

00:00:16.420 --> 00:00:18.380
Mr. Clifford: Yeah, but where do you think
strawberries came from?

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:22.449
Adriene: The ground, the farmer, the market,
the grocery store, the miracle of life?

00:00:22.449 --> 00:00:25.740
Mr. Clifford: Now look around you. Where did
all that stuff come from? And who made it?

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:30.179
And why? Well, the answer is simple, but it's
underrated. It's markets, and for most of

00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:35.340
us farms and factories and stores, but mainly
it's just markets. Can I have a strawberry now?

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:45.320
[Theme Music]

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:49.719
Adriene: So a market is any place where buyers
and sellers meet to exchange goods and services.

00:00:49.719 --> 00:00:54.019
The key to markets is the concept of voluntary
exchange. That is, that buyers and sellers

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:56.261
willingly decide to make a transaction.

00:00:56.261 --> 00:01:00.480
Let's say you go to a farmer's market and
you buy a box of strawberries for $3. You

00:01:00.489 --> 00:01:04.839
value the box of strawberries more than the
$3 you gave up to get it. The seller valued

00:01:04.839 --> 00:01:09.320
the $3 more than the box of strawberries.
The transaction's a win-win because you got

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:14.760
your strawberries and the farmer got his money.
You both felt better off; that's voluntary exchange.

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:18.759
This same process happens in the labor market.
Say that instead of the farmer's market, you

00:01:18.759 --> 00:01:24.090
bought your strawberries at your local supermarket.
The cashier voluntarily decided to work there.

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:27.880
He values the $10 an hour he makes there more
than he does sitting at home watching the

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:32.060
Walking Dead. At the same time, the owner
of the store values the labor of the cashier

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:34.520
more than the $10 an hour she pays him.

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:38.260
And so it goes, on and on, all the way up
the chain of production, from the driver that

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:41.960
delivered the strawberries to the farmer that
grew the strawberries to the tractor that

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:47.380
the farmer purchased. The point is that markets are
everywhere and most are based on voluntary exchange.

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:50.600
Mr. Clifford: The part of all this that most
people take for granted is how efficient the

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:54.299
system is. Competitive markets turn out to
be pretty great about allocating or distributing

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:56.789
our scarce resources towards their
most efficient use.

00:01:56.789 --> 00:02:00.609
So if farmers produce, like, too many strawberries,
then the price will fall as sellers try to

00:02:00.609 --> 00:02:04.810
sell them off. Lower prices means less profit
for the strawberry farmers, and those farmers

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:08.330
will have an incentive to produce something
else like lettuce or Brussels sprouts. So

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:12.129
if farmers don't produce enough strawberries,
buyers will bid up the price and the farmers

00:02:12.129 --> 00:02:16.860
will have an incentive to produce more, which then
drives down the price. That's like magic except it's not.

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:20.780
The information that markets generate to guide
a distribution of resources is what economists

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:25.050
call price signals. Markets also incentivize
the production of high-quality products. If

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:28.160
the strawberries are brown and nasty then
no one's gonna want to buy them, and if the

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:32.159
tractor's a piece of junk, the strawberry farmer's
gonna tell other farmers to buy some other tractor.

00:02:32.159 --> 00:02:35.720
Now, ideally the eventual result of voluntary
exchange is that sellers can't make themselves

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:38.450
better off without making something that makes
buyers better off.

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:42.610
Businesses, and in particular large corporations,
are often villainized as greedy, heartless

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:46.650
institutions that take advantage of consumers,
but if markets are transparent and buyers

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:50.150
are free to choose, then businesses will have
a hard time taking advantage of people.

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:53.550
Now obviously greed and deception happen in
real life, and there are situations where

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:57.590
consumers don't have a choice, but for the
most part, if you really don't like the policies

00:02:57.590 --> 00:03:01.890
or practices of a particular company, then
don't shop there. After all, in the free market,

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:05.920
every dollar that is spent signals to producers what
should be produced and how it should be produced.

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:09.500
Adriene: We've established that prices and
profit determine where resources should go,

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:14.409
but where do prices come from? Who determines
the price of my box of strawberries? To answer

00:03:14.409 --> 00:03:19.370
that, we're gonna draw - get ready for it
- supply and demand. Let's go to the runway.

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:22.799
Mr. Clifford: If there's only one thing you
should learn in economics, it's supply and

00:03:22.799 --> 00:03:26.459
demand. Let's use the market for strawberries
to help us understand this concept. Up here

00:03:26.459 --> 00:03:31.539
on the Y axis, we have the price of strawberries,
down here on the X axis we have the quantity of boxes of strawberries.

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:35.140
Let's start by looking at buyers and how they
respond to a change in price. If the price

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:38.299
goes up for strawberries, then some buyers
will go buy blueberries or they'll go on that

00:03:38.299 --> 00:03:42.209
all bacon diet. The point is, they're gonna
buy less strawberries. And if the price goes

00:03:42.209 --> 00:03:46.209
down for strawberries, then people are gonna
buy more. This is called the law of demand:

00:03:46.209 --> 00:03:50.250
when the price goes up, people buy less, when
the price goes down, people buy more. On the

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:52.470
graph it's show by a downward sloping demand
curve.

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:56.090
Now let's think about sellers like the farmer
in the farmer's market. If the price of strawberries

00:03:56.090 --> 00:04:00.170
go up, then that farmer will make more profit,
so will have an incentive to produce more

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:03.599
strawberries. If the price goes down then
he's not gonna want to produce strawberries.

00:04:03.599 --> 00:04:07.479
That's called the law of supply, and on the
graph it's shown by an upward sloping supply curve.

00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:11.819
Now let's put supply and demand together.
If the price is really high at $10 then producers

00:04:11.819 --> 00:04:15.209
would like to produce a lot of strawberries,
but consumers won't want to buy them. This

00:04:15.209 --> 00:04:19.360
mismatch is called a surplus. And if the price
goes down for strawberries, let's say down

00:04:19.360 --> 00:04:23.190
to $1, then buyers want to buy a whole lot,
but producers won't have incentive and they'll

00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:25.980
produce very little. At the end you have mismatch,
but this one's called a shortage.

00:04:25.980 --> 00:04:29.890
And there's only one price where the quantity
that buyers want to buy is exactly equal to

00:04:29.890 --> 00:04:33.590
the quantity that sellers want to sell, and
it's right here where supply equals demand.

00:04:33.590 --> 00:04:37.480
The price is called the equilibrium price,
and the quantity is called the equilibrium quantity.

00:04:37.480 --> 00:04:41.440
Adriene: Okay, sure your graph makes sense,
but the price of strawberries isn't always

00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:47.390
$3; sometimes it goes up to $6, and at Whole
Foods, local, artisanally grown strawberries,

00:04:47.390 --> 00:04:51.720
the fancy fancy strawberries, can cost upwards
of $12. But I guess Whole Foods is a whole

00:04:51.720 --> 00:04:56.140
other world where price has nothing to do
with realistic economics. We'll stick to normal

00:04:56.140 --> 00:04:59.260
strawberries. In fact, the prices for all
sort of stuff change all the time.

00:04:59.260 --> 00:05:03.640
External forces can shift both the supply
and demand curves, changing the equilibrium

00:05:03.640 --> 00:05:08.190
price and quantity. For example, let's assume
that this graph shows the demand and supply

00:05:08.190 --> 00:05:12.130
of strawberries in the summer. What happens
in the winter? Will the change in weather

00:05:12.130 --> 00:05:18.190
affect buyers' demand? Or producers supply?
Spoiler alert: it's supply. Colder temperatures

00:05:18.190 --> 00:05:23.740
make it harder to grow strawberries. The result
is the entire supply curve is gonna shift to the left.

00:05:23.740 --> 00:05:29.000
This is because at all possible prices, there'd
be fewer strawberries produced. That's it.

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:33.010
This graph is just a tool that economists
and everyone else used to show the results

00:05:33.010 --> 00:05:37.470
of a change in a market. I know it seems complicated
at first, but there are really only four things

00:05:37.470 --> 00:05:39.330
that can happen in a market.

00:05:39.330 --> 00:05:44.690
Supply can decrease, supply can increase,
demand can decrease, or demand can increase.

00:05:44.690 --> 00:05:48.820
Some people might wanna talk about a price
being fair or right. Well, that all depends

00:05:48.820 --> 00:05:53.170
on your point of view. The buyer always considers
a low price to be a very fair price, while

00:05:53.170 --> 00:05:57.760
the seller considers it unfair and vice versa.
In general, economists don't really like to

00:05:57.760 --> 00:06:02.890
push opinions about prices. Voluntary exchange
suggests that the price is there for a reason.

00:06:02.890 --> 00:06:07.660
For example, assume the demand for strawberries
inexplicably falls, so the demand curve shifts

00:06:07.660 --> 00:06:12.460
to the left and the equilibrium price and
quantity fall. Farmers might go to the government

00:06:12.460 --> 00:06:16.850
for assistance, but most economists would
argue there's no reason to bail them out.

00:06:16.850 --> 00:06:19.550
The market's spoken. Strawberries are so over.

00:06:19.550 --> 00:06:23.410
Furthermore, if the government helps the farmers
by giving them a subsidy, it would be putting

00:06:23.410 --> 00:06:28.790
resources towards something that society doesn't
value. That would be inefficient. Luckily,

00:06:28.790 --> 00:06:32.750
every reasonable person on Earth values strawberries,
so they continue to get produced.

00:06:32.750 --> 00:06:36.570
Mr. Clifford: Now, the downside is, the supply
and demand model only applies to analyzing

00:06:36.570 --> 00:06:40.110
strawberries. Nah, I'm just joking; it applies
to all sorts of stuff. In fact, let's look

00:06:40.110 --> 00:06:43.870
at a market for a commodity known for its
volatility, both because of its fluctuating

00:06:43.870 --> 00:06:46.440
prices and because sometimes, it explodes:
gasoline.

00:06:46.440 --> 00:06:50.740
Now when you see gas prices are moving all
over the board, that's just demand and supply.

00:06:50.740 --> 00:06:54.730
For example, in 2014, the retail gas price
in the United States fell dramatically. Why?

00:06:54.730 --> 00:06:59.750
Well, it was demand and supply. The economies
of both Europe and China weakened, which decreased

00:06:59.750 --> 00:07:03.440
the demand for gasoline, shifting the demand
curve to the left. At the same time, new fracking

00:07:03.440 --> 00:07:08.030
technology and restored production of oil
in Iraq and Libya caused the supply of gasoline

00:07:08.030 --> 00:07:12.420
to increase, or shift to the right. The combination
drove gas prices down by more than 40% per

00:07:12.420 --> 00:07:15.620
gallon. And that's it. Now you can tell all
your friends you understand supply and demand.

00:07:15.620 --> 00:07:17.320
It's a big day for you. It's a big day.

00:07:17.320 --> 00:07:22.530
Adrienne: So markets and supply and demand
are awesome. But sometimes, they're not awesome.

00:07:22.530 --> 00:07:27.260
For example, we don't wanna use the market
approach when it comes to firefighters.

00:07:27.260 --> 00:07:28.640
[Phone rings]

00:07:28.640 --> 00:07:31.410
911, what's your emergency?

00:07:31.410 --> 00:07:34.810
Mr. Clifford: My house is on fire, how much
do you charge to put it out?

00:07:34.810 --> 00:07:36.660
Adrienne: It'll be $10,000, what's your credit
card number?

00:07:36.660 --> 00:07:38.430
Mr. Clifford: They're all melted!

00:07:38.430 --> 00:07:43.660
Adrienne: [hangs up] Okay, that one's obvious,
but what about the market for human organs?

00:07:43.660 --> 00:07:48.610
After all, there's a huge shortage, and thousands
of people die each year waiting for transplants.

00:07:48.610 --> 00:07:52.760
Should there be a competitive market for human
kidneys? A free marketeer would say sure,

00:07:52.760 --> 00:07:57.780
why not? If a donor wants $15,000 more than
he wants his other kidney, why stop him?

00:07:57.780 --> 00:08:00.640
Mr. Clifford: Well. Ethics. I mean, there's
several problems that arise with an unregulated

00:08:00.640 --> 00:08:04.380
market for human kidneys. First is the moral
question, is it fair for a poor person who

00:08:04.380 --> 00:08:08.930
can't afford a kidney to die while a rich
person lives? Well, probably...no, not at

00:08:08.930 --> 00:08:11.960
all. Another problem results in the law of
supply. When there's an increase in the price

00:08:11.960 --> 00:08:15.550
of kidneys, there's an incentive for people
to steal and sell kidneys. In fact, the World

00:08:15.550 --> 00:08:19.030
Health Organization has stated, "Payment for
organs is likely to take unfair advantage

00:08:19.030 --> 00:08:22.810
of the poorest and most vulnerable groups,
undermines altruistic donations, and leads

00:08:22.810 --> 00:08:26.430
to profiteering and human trafficking. I mean,
all bad things. Now, that being said, why

00:08:26.430 --> 00:08:30.690
do 70% of American economic association members
support some kind of payment for organ donors?

00:08:30.690 --> 00:08:33.960
Adrienne: Well, it's because you can solve
some of these problems with a market approach,

00:08:33.960 --> 00:08:39.080
but the market must be regulated. Often family
and friends are willing to donate a kidney,

00:08:39.080 --> 00:08:43.830
but they're not a match for the patient. Economists
generally support creating kidney exchanges,

00:08:43.830 --> 00:08:48.010
where pairs of willing donors are matched
with strangers that agree to donate to each

00:08:48.010 --> 00:08:53.410
others' loved ones. In both cases, the supply
of donated kidneys would increase, which would

00:08:53.410 --> 00:08:57.660
alleviate some of the shortage. Like we've
said before, free markets are awesome, but they

00:08:57.660 --> 00:09:03.040
can't solve all our problems Sometimes, they need to
be regulated, and sometimes, they should be avoided.

00:09:03.050 --> 00:09:08.610
So there you have what, for most people, is
the start and for many, the end of economics.

00:09:08.610 --> 00:09:13.260
Supply and demand. Economists and politicians
often like to refer to the interaction of

00:09:13.270 --> 00:09:18.430
supply and demand as laws, and we've done
that too, but to be clear, it's not an absolute

00:09:18.430 --> 00:09:19.920
law, like the law of gravity.

00:09:19.920 --> 00:09:23.120
Mr. Clifford: As we've tried to point out
here on Crash Course, economics is about human

00:09:23.130 --> 00:09:26.540
choices and their consequences. Even though
supply and demand behave in a predictable

00:09:26.540 --> 00:09:29.790
way that we've seen in the models, we can't
lose sight of the fact that both of them are

00:09:29.790 --> 00:09:32.180
reliant on humans acting as buyers and sellers.

00:09:32.180 --> 00:09:36.560
Adrienne: Our actions influence supply and
demand in a way that they can't influence

00:09:36.560 --> 00:09:39.620
gravity, no matter how much we might want
to.

00:09:39.620 --> 00:09:41.080
Mr. Clifford: Whoa.

00:09:41.080 --> 00:09:45.240
Adrienne: That's After Effects. And that's
something to keep in mind when you hear us

00:09:45.240 --> 00:09:49.740
or anybody talking about economic laws. Thanks
