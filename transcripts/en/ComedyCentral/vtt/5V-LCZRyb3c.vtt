00:00:01.267 --> 00:00:02.167
On November 6th
there's an election.

00:00:02.167 --> 00:00:03.202
You might be thinking-

00:00:03.202 --> 00:00:03.870
Wow, a new president already?

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:05.271
No.

00:00:05.271 --> 00:00:06.272
This is not
a presidential election.

00:00:06.272 --> 00:00:07.506
It's the mid terms.

00:00:07.506 --> 00:00:08.741
Senators.
Congress people.

00:00:08.741 --> 00:00:10.343
Governors.
Local officials.

00:00:10.343 --> 00:00:11.277
All Americans are asking
themselves-

00:00:11.277 --> 00:00:12.044
The same questions.

00:00:12.044 --> 00:00:13.446
Should I vote?

00:00:13.446 --> 00:00:14.613
How will I know
that I should vote-

00:00:14.613 --> 00:00:16.082
If celebrities don't tell me to?

00:00:16.082 --> 00:00:17.116
Does Emma Stone think
I should vote?

00:00:17.116 --> 00:00:18.385

Have you guys seen
A Quiet Place?

00:00:20.052 --> 00:00:21.554
Yes, but that isn't what
this is about right now.

00:00:21.554 --> 00:00:22.955
It's about celebrities-

00:00:22.955 --> 00:00:24.124
Telling regular Americans-

00:00:24.124 --> 00:00:25.291
That they have to vote.

00:00:25.291 --> 00:00:26.459
Many normal Americans like us-

00:00:26.459 --> 00:00:27.893
Don't know what we should do-

00:00:27.893 --> 00:00:29.295
Until celebrities tell us
what to do.

00:00:29.295 --> 00:00:30.629
Should I moisturize?

00:00:30.629 --> 00:00:32.465
Jennifer
Aniston says you should.

00:00:32.465 --> 00:00:34.300
That's a yes.
But should we vote?

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:35.801
Some people are calling

00:00:35.801 --> 00:00:37.069
this the most important
election of our lives.

00:00:37.069 --> 00:00:38.204
But they aren't famous.

00:00:38.204 --> 00:00:39.472

00:00:39.472 --> 00:00:40.740

the Tank Engine, should I vote?

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:50.683
