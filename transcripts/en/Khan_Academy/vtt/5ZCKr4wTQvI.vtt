00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:03.307
Find the perimeter
of the parallelogram.

00:00:03.307 --> 00:00:05.140
And we have a parallelogram
right over here.

00:00:05.140 --> 00:00:07.230
Opposite sides are parallel.

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:10.500
That side is parallel to
that side right over here.

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:12.830
This side is parallel
to that side over here.

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:14.760
And also in a parallelogram,
opposite sides

00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:15.990
have the same length.

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:18.600
Now, we have to worry about
the perimeter here, which

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:21.290
essentially just says that
if we had a field the size

00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:22.930
or the shape of
this parallelogram,

00:00:22.930 --> 00:00:26.010
and we wanted to make a
fence around the field that

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:28.230
was the shape of this
parallelogram, how long would

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:29.670
that fence have to be?

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:32.200
And obviously, it
would be the sum

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:34.040
of the lengths of the sides.

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:35.510
So we wouldn't
even have to worry

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:36.770
about this thing
right over here.

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:38.770
We could ignore it for
the sake of that problem.

00:00:38.770 --> 00:00:40.756
We don't care about
the actual height,

00:00:40.756 --> 00:00:42.130
or this altitude
right over here.

00:00:42.130 --> 00:00:44.090
We just care about the
lengths of its sides.

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:46.253
So the perimeter of
this parallelogram

00:00:46.253 --> 00:00:50.560
is going to be 12
inches plus 8 inches

00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:53.787
plus 12 inches plus 8 inches.

00:00:58.530 --> 00:00:59.680
12 plus 8 is 20.

00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:01.910
12 plus 8 is 20.

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:06.850
So this is all going
to add up to 40 inches.

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:07.990
And we're done.

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:09.570
I guess this is a
very small field,

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:10.970
because it's only 8 inches.

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:13.530
I guess it would be a
little plot of land,

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:15.600
a little parallelogram
plot of land.

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:16.660
Anyway, we're done.

00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:19.370
Its perimeter is 40 inches.
