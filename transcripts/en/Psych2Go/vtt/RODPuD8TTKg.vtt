Hello Psych2Go-ers!

00:00:01.400 --> 00:00:02.860
We just want to
take the time to thank you

00:00:02.860 --> 00:00:04.640
for all your kind of support.

00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:05.540
We are a team of

00:00:05.540 --> 00:00:08.280
dedicated, passionate,
and hard-working individuals,

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:11.120
who come together every day
with one goal in mind:

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:14.100
We want to make psychology
come alive for you.

00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:16.740
We are self-funded
and recently launched our Patreon!

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:19.500
If you enjoy the work we do
and find it meaningful,

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:20.980
please stick around
until the end of the video

00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:23.160
for information on
how to get more involved with us,

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:25.510
and all the cool rewards
you can get from us.

00:00:25.510 --> 00:00:28.480
Asking someone out
can be downright scary.

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:29.720
Your heart may be racing right now

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:31.580
just thinking about your crush.

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:32.480
You keep telling yourself

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:34.460
that today will be
the day you do it,

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:36.760
whether it's when you both
have physics class together,

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:38.660
through a text message
during your lunch break,

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:40.500
or a phone call
right before you head to bed.

00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:43.700
One common misconception
about our dating culture,

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:45.540
is that the awkwardness
and sweaty palms

00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:47.340
only happen in our teenage years.

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:49.060
But many adults can find it

00:00:49.060 --> 00:00:50.780
just as nerve-wracking,
and struggle with it.

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:54.460
We understand how intimidating it is
to put yourself out there,

00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:57.260
and want to help you practice
being open and vulnerable.

00:00:57.480 --> 00:00:59.660
Here are 5 ways
to ask someone out.

00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:02.280
1. Find a common ground.

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:03.740
Before asking someone out,

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:04.840
It's important to find out

00:01:04.840 --> 00:01:06.660
whether you two have
something in common.

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:08.940
Instead of making generic small talk,

00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:10.040
you can delve into topics

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:11.700
that help you get to
know each other better.

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:12.920
For instance,

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:14.800
You can talk about
recent movies or books

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:16.300
that made an impact on your life,

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:18.420
If you know that they have
also seen or read them.

00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:20.880
You can also ask them
about what their passions,

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:22.620
interests, hobbies and dreams are.

00:01:22.660 --> 00:01:25.040
Once you find something
that the two of you share,

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:27.420
you can converse with them
on a deeper level,

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:29.340
rather than having
dead-end conversations

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:31.800
that prevent the both of you
from growing closer.

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:34.480
2. Pick a safe activity.

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:35.520
Pick an activity

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:37.940
that allows the both of you to bond
and have a good time.

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:39.940
Going out for coffee or drinks,

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:40.780
a walk in the park,

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:43.560
or a museum are safe options
that aren't too overwhelming.

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:45.860
Make sure that
the location you pick,

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:47.360
isn't too crowded or noisy

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:49.240
that prevents you from
hearing each other speak.

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:52.100
This is especially important for introverts.

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:53.620
Is your crush an introvert?

00:01:53.620 --> 00:01:56.080
Check out our video,
"5 dating tips for introverts"

00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:57.680
for more helpful information.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:01:59.760
It's commonly advised not to

00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:01.480
go to the movie theater
as a first date,

00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:04.040
because it doesn't give you
a chance to interact as much.

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:05.300
But if the two of you decide

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:07.700
to have ice cream
and talk about the film later,

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:09.180
It can act as an icebreaker,

00:02:09.180 --> 00:02:10.440
and give you something to talk about.

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:14.900
3. It's cliche and overused,
but, be yourself.

00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:16.780
You hear this line all the time,

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:18.500
but there's a reason why it's true.

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:20.420
When you're in a relationship with someone,

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:23.480
It's not about constantly
telling each other how great you are,

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:26.120
that leaves you no room
to be yourself on your bad days.

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:28.760
The same applies
to asking someone out.

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:31.140
Avoid sounding like a salesperson.

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:33.860
Instead, be authentic, and honest.

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:36.700
Let the other person know
that you think they're interesting,

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:38.620
and that you're willing
to learn more about them.

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:40.860
Remember not to be pushy or forceful.

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:43.960
After all, you can't make someone
return the same feelings.

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:46.940
Respecting each other's space
and boundaries is important.

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:50.360
4. Figure out where
you want to ask them.

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:51.780
In this day and age,

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:54.000
we can text, email,
or call our crushes

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:55.300
when we want to ask them out.

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:57.960
Asking someone out in person
is also an option,

00:02:57.960 --> 00:03:00.100
but it may be used
less often nowadays,

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:02.020
because of how intimidating it can be.

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:04.520
Depending on how long
you have known the person,

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:07.400
and whether or not the two of you
have exchanged phone numbers,

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:08.760
added each other on social media,

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:10.060
or have mutual friends,

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:12.540
figure out which method
works best for you.

00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:16.080
Keep in mind that each platform
has its own pros and cons.

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:17.420
For instance,

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:18.600
Asking someone out in person

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:20.840
doesn't give you a chance
to retype a message,

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:23.000
but it does allow you
to see their reaction,

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:24.660
and their answer will be immediate,

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:26.580
rather than waiting
to hear back from a text.

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:29.640
5. Be brave, take the leap!

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:32.080
Don't wait too long
to make your move,

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:33.280
seize the day!

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:35.220
It's scary putting
your heart on the line,

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:37.620
but you never know
what may happen if you don't try.

00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:39.860
Constantly letting your fears and thoughts

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:40.980
dwell up inside of you,

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:43.180
will only allow
your walls to grow higher.

00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:44.820
It's better to take a chance,

00:03:44.820 --> 00:03:47.060
than look back
with regrets and what-ifs.

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:48.940
There will be times
they'll be rejected,

00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:51.180
but, remember that
this only brings you closer

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:52.740
to the person
you're meant to be with.

00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:54.820
We wish you the best of luck!

00:03:55.320 --> 00:03:56.140
Do you have trouble

00:03:56.140 --> 00:03:58.400

to ask someone out?
